(Waking moans, sighs)

00:09.677 --> 00:11.379
(Text messages chime)

00:13.147 --> 00:17.385
- Um, Alexis, do you mind
telling your phone to fuck off?

00:17.418 --> 00:19.220
(Text messages chime)

00:19.253 --> 00:20.421
Ugh.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.425
What's bumpkin?

00:25.626 --> 00:28.129
- What?
Nothing. Gimme that.

00:28.162 --> 00:31.099
- Oh my god,
is this a dating app?

00:31.132 --> 00:33.667
- It's an online social hub
for rural singles,

00:33.701 --> 00:36.070
if you must know, David.
I signed Twyla up.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.806
- Well, why does it say Alexis
you have a new match?

00:38.839 --> 00:41.409
- Research. I was testing
the water for her, David.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.344
Poor thing's clueless.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.279
- Well, Miguel says hi.

00:45.313 --> 00:48.449
Why is he shirtless
with an armful of puppies?

00:48.482 --> 00:49.750
- Oh my god, we matched?

00:49.783 --> 00:52.253
- His nipples are out.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.555
- Ted can't know about this,
David.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.357
Miguel's the only other vet
in town,

00:56.390 --> 00:58.492
and they have this like
dumb rivalry.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.328
- When has that ever stopped
you?

01:00.361 --> 01:03.231
I remember that summer you
dated all 3 Hanson brothers.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.398
- This is different.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.138
- How did you even match with
Miguel in the first place?

01:10.171 --> 01:11.839
- I swiped right, obviously.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.707
Like look at him, David.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.510
I didn't actually expect
we'd match.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.846
- You didn't expect to match.
- Okay, fine, I did,

01:18.879 --> 01:21.415
but I just wanted to see
what would happen.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.284
He's the only attractive person
on here, David,

01:23.317 --> 01:24.818
what did you want me to do?

01:24.852 --> 01:26.520
- Well, then go on a date
with him.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.622
- I can't.
- Fine, then don't.

01:28.656 --> 01:31.592
- Okay, but I want to, David.
- Oh my god, Alexis,

01:31.625 --> 01:34.495
I am suffering romantically
right now,

01:34.528 --> 01:36.597
and there was a minute
when I thought

01:36.630 --> 01:38.566
I would never have to look
at another dating app,

01:38.599 --> 01:41.635
and here you are shoving
Bumpkins in my face.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.372
- It's Bumpkin
with a wink emoji.

01:44.405 --> 01:45.906
- (David sighs)

01:45.939 --> 01:48.609
(Text message chimes)
- He messaged me again.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.179
He actually sounds
kind of chill, David.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.647
- What did he say?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.251
- Sup?
- Okay.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.560
(Cart rumbles)

02:06.594 --> 02:08.529
- Ready when you are, Mr. Rose.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.198
- Ready for what?

02:10.231 --> 02:12.933
- We have a 1:00 reservation
for lunch at the café.

02:12.966 --> 02:17.405
- Oh Moira, I completely
forgot about lunch.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.639
- (Gasps)

02:18.672 --> 02:20.741
- And I just gave Stevie
the day off.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.843
- How many days off is
Stevie allowed to request?

02:22.876 --> 02:25.779
- Well, she'd worked
14 straight days, so...

02:25.813 --> 02:27.848
- It's starting to remind me
of Rose Video,

02:27.881 --> 02:31.185
when your work consumed you,
and I would miss you so.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.254
Except now I don't have the jet

02:33.287 --> 02:34.855
and the free DVD's
to distract me.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.657
- Well, I don't know
what to say, Sweetheart,

02:36.690 --> 02:38.659
I-I still have most
of the rooms to clean.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.594
- Would it be too much to ask
the guests

02:40.628 --> 02:42.463
to clean up after themselves?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.964
- Hm, yes, it would.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.634
It's basically the only
service we provide.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.937
- Very well.
If lunch is cancelled,

02:49.970 --> 02:52.906
I suppose I'll show up on time
for Jazzagals rehearsal.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.942
- Isn't that something you
should be doing anyway?

02:54.975 --> 02:57.245
- Oh, there's so much time
wasted off top, John.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.579
Yap, yap, yap, do, re, mi.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.449
A lip buzzing
'til I'm blue in the face!

03:02.583 --> 03:04.685
- I promise I'll make it up
to you, Sweetheart.

03:04.952 --> 03:08.222
- Okay. As long as we're
tabulating scores,

03:08.256 --> 03:11.692
this will mark the 3rd time you
stood me up this week, John.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.563
(Footsteps clank)

03:16.497 --> 03:18.932
(Door opens)

03:18.966 --> 03:20.634
- Hmm.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.303
(Drapes rasp)

03:24.905 --> 03:26.474
- (Grunts)

03:26.507 --> 03:28.242
Turn everything off, please.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.544
- Why aren't you dressed?
- Because I'm not going.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.280
Because I'm too tired.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.682
- You've been sleeping
for two days.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.417
- What's your point?

03:36.450 --> 03:37.885
- I'm finding it hard
to believe

03:37.918 --> 03:40.454
that you don't have
the energy to go to a spa.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.556
- I know, I'm scaring even me.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.725
Why are we going to a spa,
again?

03:44.758 --> 03:46.894
- Because you're having
boyfriend issues,

03:46.927 --> 03:49.830
and this is my reluctant
attempt at being supportive.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.632
- Well, that's very thoughtful
of you.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.767
- I also have a Groupon,

03:53.801 --> 03:55.569
which I was planning on
using with Jake,

03:55.603 --> 03:57.371
but I thought you might
need it more,

03:57.405 --> 04:00.040
so, get up before I change
my mind.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.909
- I can't.
- Get up.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.644
- No!

04:03.677 --> 04:05.579
- Oh my god, David.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.714
- Ah!

04:06.747 --> 04:08.849
- This is really pathetic.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.285
- (Sighs)

04:11.819 --> 04:14.655
What kinda spa is it,
and will there be treatments?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.557
- You're a monster.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.795
Twyla: Miguel looks so strong
holding all those puppies.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.731
Maybe I should get
into online dating?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.899
- Oh, I'm not into online
dating,

04:25.933 --> 04:27.668
I'm just showing David
how it works.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.371
- So when are you seeing him?
- Oh wow, no,

04:30.404 --> 04:32.640
I don't think that would
actually be a good idea.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.708
In fact, I might have
to cancel on him tonight.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.078
- So you are seeing him?

04:38.111 --> 04:42.350
- Technically yes, but like,
he and Ted have this thing.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.518
- Oh, and Ted asked you
not to see him.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.019
- No, he doesn't know.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.688
- Sorry, so what's the problem?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.690
I mean, Ted's not going
on a date with him.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.859
- Yeah, I mean I guess there
isn't really anything

04:51.892 --> 04:54.828
standing in the way.
- So there you go.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.430
- It's just that I used
to date Ted,

04:56.464 --> 04:57.865
and now I'm gonna be dating
this guy,

04:57.898 --> 04:59.367
and it's just gonna be weird,

04:59.400 --> 05:01.569
and I don't wanna do anything
to upset Ted.

05:01.602 --> 05:05.005
- So then maybe don't go
on a date with this guy?

05:05.038 --> 05:07.007
- It's just that there
are like ten guys on here,

05:07.040 --> 05:09.042
and three of them are Ray.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.712

05:35.068 --> 05:37.037
Oh no, you can speak freely

David's fine.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.107
A little depressed.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.476
Stevie had to force him into
her car, but you know.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.579
- Then, to what do we owe
this off-book sojourn?

05:46.113 --> 05:48.782
- Well, I thought about
what you said,

05:48.816 --> 05:51.118
and I didn't wanna fall
into old habits,

05:51.151 --> 05:54.622
so I delegated the rest
of the cleaning to Roland.

but was that wise?

05:57.891 --> 06:00.127
No offense, Jocelyn.

the same thing.

- If that doesn't scream
romance.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.709
- There was a time when
this dusky charmer

06:15.743 --> 06:18.979
used to constantly whisk me
off to ports unknown.

and I found out

07:28.616 --> 07:31.619
that if you tell these resorts
that it's your honeymoon,

07:31.652 --> 07:34.121
they usually upgrade
your room and stuff,

07:34.154 --> 07:37.124

are goin' on dates

- And we're still going for
post-rehearsal mocktails,

09:54.394 --> 09:55.963
right ladies?

09:55.996 --> 09:58.732
- I dunno about anybody else,
but I am drinkin'.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.701
- So we're all headed
in the same direction?

10:00.734 --> 10:02.102
Jocelyn: It looks like it.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.371
- I'll get out the fancy
martini glasses. Fun!

10:04.404 --> 10:08.041
- Boy, we never did this back
in the Rose Video days, did we?

10:08.075 --> 10:10.377
- No, but I'm sure
we had our reasons.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.216
(Muffled music plays)

10:17.350 --> 10:19.219
(Pool balls clatter)

10:21.154 --> 10:22.422
(Low hum of chatter)

10:22.455 --> 10:24.257
- Alexis.
- Yes?

10:24.291 --> 10:26.393
- Miguel.
- Oh my gosh, hey.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.828
- Hi.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.329
- I didn't recognize you
without your nipples.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.431
- Huh?
- The puppies...the um,

10:31.464 --> 10:33.967
the cute little puppies
that you love to photograph
yourself with.

10:34.001 --> 10:37.404
- Ha ha, yeah, yeah, I left
them at home. The puppies.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.406
Brought the nipples.
- Oh good.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.942
Not about the nipples,
um, about the puppies.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.311
- Right.
- So anyway, how are you?

10:44.344 --> 10:46.013
- Uh good. Good, good.

10:46.046 --> 10:50.417
I'm just really glad we could
make this work. Champagne?

10:50.450 --> 10:52.686
- Uh, they serve champagne
here?

10:52.720 --> 10:54.855
- I believe it's called
Zhampagne,

10:54.888 --> 10:58.692
it's from the very famous
Zhampagne region of France.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.961
- Can't wait to try it.
- Mmhmm.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.697
(Rock music plays)

11:05.766 --> 11:07.167
- Hmm.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.270
- So, um, how long you been
on the app?

11:10.303 --> 11:12.472
- Uh, oh I'm not.
Well I am,

11:12.505 --> 11:14.474
but I just downloaded it
to show a friend.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.810
- Well, worked out well for me.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.046
- Someone's a smooth talker.
(Laughs)

11:19.079 --> 11:20.914
- No.
- This is a relief.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.116
I um, I was actually thinking
about not coming.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.218
- What was holding you back?

11:25.252 --> 11:27.855
- Uh, I dunno, just like
am I ready for this,

11:27.888 --> 11:29.990
and I'm not even on the app,
so like should I be using it?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.358
- Right.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.226
- I just like making careful
choices.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.828
- Yeah, yeah. I'm just glad

11:34.862 --> 11:36.964
that you... you could come out
tonight.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.366
Um, (Clears throat)

11:39.399 --> 11:41.935
to...careful choices.

11:41.969 --> 11:44.004
- Yes. To that.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.839
(Glasses clink)

11:45.873 --> 11:47.174
(Soft piano music plays)

11:48.275 --> 11:51.011
(Low hum of patron chatter)

11:51.044 --> 11:52.946
- Okay, everybody.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.381
(Applause)

11:56.549 --> 12:01.021
Hi. I'm Bobbie, and I am so
excited to be your waitress.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.291
We just love honeymooners here
at Crystal Elms.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.926
Please, right this way.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.162
Here you go.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.464
- Wow.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.500
- Oh my god.
- Thank you.

12:17.037 --> 12:21.374
- Okay, and I will be right
back with your menus. Okay.

12:23.043 --> 12:27.280
♪♪♪

12:27.314 --> 12:29.416
- No. Absolutely not.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.919
- Okay, and I completely
understand.

12:31.952 --> 12:36.423
Um, I just worry that
if we don't put the hats on,

12:36.456 --> 12:39.226
that the other guests will
inevitably force us to.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.994
- Okay.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.429
- So.

12:43.563 --> 12:47.034
- So, turns out we are not
the only ones celebrating

12:47.067 --> 12:49.036
the bride and groom.

12:49.069 --> 12:52.005
This is from a Patrick.

12:52.039 --> 12:55.876
Says, "have fun, enjoy the
night. Thinking about you."

12:55.909 --> 12:59.379
Oh, wow, that is just
very sweet.

12:59.412 --> 13:03.283
And I can assure you
that a fun night is guaranteed

13:03.316 --> 13:06.386
after a bottle of this. Right?

13:06.419 --> 13:08.822
(Click tongue)
Yeah, she gets it. Okay.

13:10.357 --> 13:13.426
- Did our waitress just
make a sex reference?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.562
- I mean, I don't think that's
really surprising

13:15.595 --> 13:17.264
at this point.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.067
Um, so you obviously
have spoken to Patrick

13:20.100 --> 13:22.402
since he knows we're here.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.038
- Okay um, we may have been
texting.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.876
He's covering for me at work.

13:30.077 --> 13:34.281
- And these, these are our
complimentary lovebird wings.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.417
They are chicken,
not actual lovebirds.

13:37.450 --> 13:41.188
Uh, and oh, the special
tonight is a lover's curry.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.925
So, I will be back, and I will
take your order. Okay so.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.259
- Oh, wow.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.095
- Oh, one more.
- Oh my god.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.930
- Oh. (Laughs)

13:52.299 --> 13:54.367
Sorry, you were saying?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.406
- Um, how did you get
so good at this?

13:59.439 --> 14:00.974
- Hm, you learn pretty quickly

14:01.008 --> 14:02.876
when you're in a Ugandan
diamond smuggler's villa

14:02.910 --> 14:04.411
playing for your friend's
freedom.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.513
- Right, right. Wait, what?
- That was fun.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.982
- Yeah, I know. I know.
I don't uh... you know,

14:09.016 --> 14:11.919
I don't get to date a lot.
Busy schedule and...

14:11.952 --> 14:15.355
and whatnot, but there is just
something about you, you know...

14:15.388 --> 14:17.657
(Laughs)
I actually,

14:17.690 --> 14:20.994
I changed my shirt 3 times
for tonight and uh,

14:21.028 --> 14:23.396
I'm sorry, I probably shouldn't
be giving that all away.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.265
- No, it's cute.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.300
- And I was actually nervous,
too.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.502
- Well, you... you look great.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.671
- No, yeah,
I know it wasn't that.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.673
Um, you're gonna think
this is so random,

14:33.706 --> 14:36.209
but it was actually
about something else.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.978
- Well, whatever it was,

14:38.011 --> 14:40.147
I'm just glad that
we could do this.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.448
I used to date Ted.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.283
- I'm sorry?
- Ted Mullins?

14:43.316 --> 14:44.952
He's the veterinarian.
- No, no, no,

14:44.985 --> 14:46.519
I know who Ted is.
- Okay cool,

14:46.553 --> 14:48.521
I just felt like we were being
honest with each other.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.158
- Wait, weren't you his
receptionist?

14:51.191 --> 14:54.261
- Executive Assistant. And yes,
but only for like a minute.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.263
- But you guys were engaged?

14:56.296 --> 14:59.099
- Um, very briefly.
- Uh-huh.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.367
- And just twice.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.402
And we've both moved on.
He has a girlfriend now,

15:02.435 --> 15:05.038
and apparently they're
like very serious.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.474
- Okay look, there is nobody
who wants to see Ted fail

15:07.507 --> 15:09.342
more than I do,
professionally speaking.

15:09.376 --> 15:13.113
Personally, I feel like
this is off limits.

15:13.146 --> 15:16.649
It just feels... wrong.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.987
- Okay, that is what I've been
saying, to literally everyone.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.989
- What, you've been telling
people about this?

15:22.022 --> 15:25.258
- No. Some people.
Just close friends.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.995
- And that is the reason that
I wasn't gonna come tonight.

15:28.028 --> 15:31.398
- Yeah, but you came.
- Okay, bottom line,

15:31.431 --> 15:34.101
we've both had a lot
of Zhampagne,

15:34.134 --> 15:37.237
so I just feel like we need
to hydrate, and reflect.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.139
- Wow.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.341
I mean, yeah, but...

15:44.277 --> 15:46.413
I don't think I can do this.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.450
- Okay, just to be clear,
I couldn't do this first.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.654
So I guess I am paying
for the Zhampagne then?

15:59.259 --> 16:00.727
(Laughter)

16:00.760 --> 16:04.464
- And so, he says to the cop,
"Well, if it was mine,

16:04.497 --> 16:06.099
I wouldn't've put it in my
mouth."

16:06.133 --> 16:08.168
(Laughter)

16:08.201 --> 16:10.303
- Oh, Veronica, once again,

16:10.337 --> 16:13.640
you reign supreme as the queen
of the triple entendres.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.375
- I just have to say this.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.011
I know that we are
the Jazzagals,

16:18.045 --> 16:21.381
but it was pretty great to have
a Jazza-guy in our midst today.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.649
- Oh.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.051
- Yeah, if you're around next
week,

16:24.084 --> 16:25.585
it wouldn't hurt to have
the help.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.388
- Not to dim the charge on this
delightful conversation,

16:28.421 --> 16:30.123
but John, why don't you
and I go

16:30.157 --> 16:32.125
and get the gals another drink?
- Okay.

16:32.159 --> 16:35.762
- No, no, the next round is
on us for our newest member.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.630
Lemonades for Moira and me...

16:37.664 --> 16:41.701
- And two cosmos for
the baritone section.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.270
♪ Yes, please

16:43.303 --> 16:45.338
(Laughing)

16:51.511 --> 16:53.446
- John, I wanna thank you

16:53.480 --> 16:55.648
for what you did for me today.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.651
And I know it was done
with the best of intentions.

16:58.685 --> 17:03.056
- I'm getting the sense
I did something wrong.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.058
- Oh, not at all.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.759
In fact, you've enlightened me.

17:06.793 --> 17:11.198
I realize I take one thing
for granted in this town.

17:11.231 --> 17:14.201
- Oh, Moira.
- My time with the Jazzagals.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.204
- Ah.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.606
- As sad as it sounds,

17:19.639 --> 17:22.609
these rehearsals have become
a tiny oasis

17:22.642 --> 17:26.045
in the echo-y canyon that
I now call my social life.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.316
I don't know if you've noticed,
John,

17:29.349 --> 17:33.420
but this transition has not
been the easiest for me.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.456
- I can't say that I have
not noticed.

17:37.524 --> 17:41.661
- Aside from rehearsals,
few things keep me going.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.597
My nightly sleeps,
afternoon naps,

17:46.499 --> 17:49.269
and of course meals
with my husband.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.138
- And there will be more
of those.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.106
- But John,
I have so few pleasures,

17:53.140 --> 17:55.308
that if I start combining them,

17:55.342 --> 17:58.245
then I'll have even less
to look forward to.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.747
- I understand, Moira.

18:00.780 --> 18:04.784
So, would you like me to leave
you to cocktails

18:04.817 --> 18:06.319
with the gals, then?

18:06.353 --> 18:08.121
- Oh god, no, we'll leave
together, please.

18:08.155 --> 18:10.190
There are only so many ways
I can feign amusement

18:10.223 --> 18:12.659
at Ronnie's comedia
del commode.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.130
- So the lover's curry
was a mistake.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.498
- Yeah, it was.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.500
Uh, but we got through it,

18:20.533 --> 18:23.503
and now we have a story we
can only tell each other so...

18:23.536 --> 18:25.472
- Patrick would find it funny.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.374
- We will not be telling
Patrick.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.542
- Another secret for the pile.

18:31.744 --> 18:35.482
Okay, not to put any of the
blame on you in this situation.

18:35.515 --> 18:38.485
Obviously Patrick should've
told you he had a fiancée,

18:38.518 --> 18:41.621
but what didn't you ask him?

18:41.654 --> 18:44.224
- If he had a secret fiancée?

18:44.257 --> 18:48.127
- Well, no, but did you guys not
talk about your dating history?

18:49.762 --> 18:52.565
- I guess I just thought the
deeper we got into his past,

18:52.599 --> 18:55.302
the deeper we'd have
to get into mine.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.437
And, historically speaking,

18:57.470 --> 19:00.273
the more I revealed of myself,

19:00.307 --> 19:04.477
the less interested people got.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.480
So.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.182
- Okay, so I'm gonna go out
on a limb

19:09.216 --> 19:11.551
and say that you were probably
surrounding yourself

19:11.584 --> 19:13.553
with the wrong people,

19:13.586 --> 19:16.723
and we both know that Patrick
is not that kind of person.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.626
Also, I know everything
about you,

19:21.328 --> 19:23.330
about your history,

19:23.363 --> 19:26.366
your family,
and I'm still here.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.604
- I think you're my best
friend.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.409
- You think?

19:36.443 --> 19:38.411
- Well, I can't know for sure,

19:38.445 --> 19:40.280
because I'm realizing now
that I don't think

19:40.313 --> 19:42.682
I've ever really had one.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.919
- Okay, well,
if we're being honest,

19:46.953 --> 19:50.390
I don't think I've ever had
one, either.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.930
- This would be a really
sweet moment,

19:57.964 --> 20:01.434
if what we had just admitted
to each other wasn't so sad.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.739
- Sadder? When you were
in the bathroom,

20:07.840 --> 20:11.210
I finished the rest
of the lover's curry.

20:12.712 --> 20:16.349
- Okay, you'll be sleeping
in the bathtub tonight.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.251
- I understand.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.825
- Well, honey, I don't think
you should let

20:25.858 --> 20:28.361
one embarrassing encounter
colour your experience,

20:28.395 --> 20:30.497
on Bumper.
- Bump-kin.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.465
- So you upload your photo,

20:32.499 --> 20:34.667
and the Bumpkin sends it
to local singles.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.969
- It's not called The Bumpkin.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.406
- Okay. Oh, here's one.

20:39.439 --> 20:42.509
Isaac, 31,
works on his family's farm.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.379
Certainly loves to take pictures
of himself in waterfalls.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.614
- Hmm.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.982
- Though harvesting crops
does produce

20:50.016 --> 20:52.519
a nicely-sculpted physique.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.621
- "Looking for a hook-up."

20:54.654 --> 20:56.556
Well, that sounds promising,
Alexis,

20:56.589 --> 20:58.625
he's open for hooking up
for dinner, or drinks.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.793
- Uh-uh, that's not
what that means.

21:00.827 --> 21:04.431
- Okay, moving on to Jebediah.
- Okay, stop!

21:04.464 --> 21:06.766
- Comes from a large family.
Oh, not my kids.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.502
That's a step in the right
direction, Alexis.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.938
- Scroll down, Moira.
- Okay. Oh my wives.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.407
- All right, which way do you
swipe to get rid of this one?

21:14.441 --> 21:16.042
- Okay, gimme my phone--
- Oh, Alexis, look,

21:16.075 --> 21:17.844
you've just Bumpkined
with Jebediah.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.046
- What? Ew!
- Oh, and now we're back to Ray.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.581
- Ew!

21:21.614 --> 21:23.015
- How did Ray get such
a beautiful bathroom?

21:23.049 --> 21:24.751
- Well...
