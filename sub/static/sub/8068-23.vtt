WEBVTT

00:05.873 --> 00:09.777
[theme music]

00:56.757 --> 01:01.462
I never thought I'd say this,
but I actually miss Booker.

01:01.562 --> 01:05.199
Well, that's because our new
supervisor is a real slimeball.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.234
I agree.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.802
That Mr. Faber is
a pain in the butt.

01:08.902 --> 01:09.837
Pardon my language.

01:09.937 --> 01:12.840
You sewer mouth.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.308
You know, Faber
wouldn't get on my nerves

01:14.408 --> 01:17.845
so much if he'd just die.

01:17.945 --> 01:20.080
Oh, no, death's
too good for him.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.616
Yeah, what he really deserves
is to have to work for himself.

01:22.716 --> 01:23.517
Uh-huh.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.885
Oh, I don't know.

01:24.985 --> 01:28.156
I think we should explore this
death idea a little further.

01:28.256 --> 01:31.725
Are you hens still cackling
about the new rooster?

01:31.825 --> 01:36.730
When we find a Rooster,
Lou, we'll cackle.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.400
OK, Lou, how-- how
do you handle Faber?

01:39.500 --> 01:42.936
Two words-- look busy.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.173
Well, I got two
words for you, Lou--

01:45.273 --> 01:46.073
any way--

01:50.110 --> 01:53.214
Well, you little ladies
enjoying your lunch?

01:53.314 --> 01:55.816
Well, the veal is tre bien.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.686
And how is your swordfish, sis?

01:58.786 --> 02:04.425
As usual, the food is to die
for, but the ambiance stinks.

02:04.525 --> 02:08.329
Hey, Blondie, your
workstation's a mess.

02:08.429 --> 02:12.099
Well, we always clean
up at the end of the day.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.201
I know.

02:13.301 --> 02:16.170
But your area is an
obvious safety hazard.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.940
And if you'll refer to
the employee's manual,

02:20.040 --> 02:24.612
you'll note that the supervisor
is responsible for spotting

02:24.712 --> 02:25.979
and eliminating safety hazards.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.215
Well, great.

02:27.315 --> 02:30.951
While you're doing that,
can we see the dessert tray?

02:31.051 --> 02:35.223
I hate to give an order twice.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.325
Aw, sit down, Blondie.

02:37.425 --> 02:40.228
This here is a job
for a brunette.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.663
Super brunette, da, da-da da!

02:42.763 --> 02:43.997
Da da-da!

02:44.097 --> 02:47.034
I wasn't talking to you.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.869
I was talking to her.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.705
Well, then you're obviously
tampering with destiny

02:51.805 --> 02:53.474
here because I read
my horoscope today

02:53.574 --> 02:57.278
and it said "career
advancement possible

02:57.378 --> 02:59.913
if you're willing to sweep
up little bits of plastic

03:00.013 --> 03:03.651
on your lunch hour for
no apparent reason."

03:03.751 --> 03:06.053
Da da-da da!

03:06.153 --> 03:07.020
Da, da-da da!

03:13.894 --> 03:16.930
Boy, one thing I hate to
see in a plastics factory

03:17.030 --> 03:20.934
is little bits of
plastic laying around.

03:21.034 --> 03:26.707
Well, they won't be laying
around much longer, will they?

03:26.807 --> 03:30.611
So are you just going to
stand there and watch me?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.546
Maybe I will.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.114
Maybe I won't.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.251
Well, that's a
big decision there.

03:37.351 --> 03:41.188
I guess that's why they
pay you the big bucks, huh?

03:41.289 --> 03:43.524
Will you hold this for a minute?

03:43.624 --> 03:45.693
Honey, I'm not here to hold.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.562
I'm here to supervise.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.431
Oh, yeah, I get it.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.666
Shirt, tie-- that's what you do.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.336
I must be stupid.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.770
Well, when you're
right, you're right.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.609
How long you been here anyway?

04:01.709 --> 04:03.344
Long enough.

04:03.444 --> 04:07.247
Your personnel
file says 11 years.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.582
You know, the last
three supervisors

04:08.682 --> 04:10.584
was checking out
my personnel file,

04:10.684 --> 04:12.386
but do you see any
of them around here?

04:22.195 --> 04:24.465
Your work is great
compared to your attitude.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.567
Oh, well, I'm just
keeping the morale up,

04:26.667 --> 04:28.802
you know, trying to
make your job easier.

04:28.902 --> 04:32.373
That's what I'm talking
about, your attitude.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.275
Now my brother has
this dairy farm.

04:35.376 --> 04:38.879
You know, some of those cows
take to milking right off.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.782
Some of them take
a little longer.

04:41.882 --> 04:45.619
Every once in a while, you run
across a real stubborn one.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.555
But you know what?

04:47.655 --> 04:51.058
Sooner or later,
they all give milk.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.198
Well, nothing like
a little livestock

04:58.298 --> 04:59.533
story to start out the day.

05:02.336 --> 05:06.006
I think you know
what I mean, sugar.

05:06.106 --> 05:11.111
Girls, you'll never believe
what he wanted me to do.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.180
Well, Mr. Faber!

05:21.021 --> 05:25.359
Well, I'm afraid this old
broad's got to put it to bed.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.527
Sylvia, it's Friday night.

05:26.627 --> 05:27.561
And it's early.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.498
Yeah, but I need
two days to recover.

05:30.598 --> 05:31.932
You know, these new
quotas are killing me.

05:32.032 --> 05:32.833
Yeah.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.267
Good night, everybody.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.168
Goodnight, Sylvia.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.470
Goodnight, Sylvia.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.439
Faber's a maniac.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.208
Oh, hey, he passed
maniac about a month ago.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.576
You got that right.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.044
I mean, when I'm
really smoking, I can

05:44.144 --> 05:46.346
pull maybe 15 units a minute.

05:46.447 --> 05:52.052
That's 900 units an hour,
which is 7,200 units a day.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.688
And my quota is 8,000.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.256
What does he think I am?

05:56.356 --> 05:57.558
A factory worker.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.792
You got that right.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.028
A couple of cold ones for
the tired working masses,

06:01.128 --> 06:02.496
yearning to be free.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.065
Hey, don't forget
the unemployed masses.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.500
I better not drink this.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.336
I may do something I regret.

06:09.437 --> 06:13.741
Yeah, like last time you left
your barrettes in the bathroom.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.910
Well, I'm one sip of beer away
from going over to the phone,

06:17.010 --> 06:19.680
calling that Mr. Faber
and giving him what for.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.882
Dan, you better hose her down.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.684
My quote is 8,000.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.419
I can't do 8,000.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.154
I can maybe do 7,000.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.355
I don't know
what's with this guy.

06:28.456 --> 06:31.058
Nobody can do 8,000 units.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.826
I heard him say
last week there

06:32.926 --> 06:34.595
may not be any room
at Wellman for people

06:34.695 --> 06:35.763
who can't make the quota.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.598
He'd fire us for
not making 8,000.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.700
We gotta put a
contract out on this guy,

06:39.800 --> 06:41.435
or we got to send somebody
up to the front office

06:41.535 --> 06:43.203
and complain to Mr. Wellman.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.171
What for?

06:44.271 --> 06:45.773
Hey, Wellman doesn't
set the quotas.

06:45.873 --> 06:46.774
Faber does.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.576
I used to set them
when I was there.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.611
Oh, it's so unfair.

06:50.711 --> 06:51.779
That scum bucket.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.948
So we're killing ourselves
so he can look good.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.817
It's so unfair.

06:56.917 --> 07:01.455
When I was there, I never set
the quota higher than 5,500.

07:01.555 --> 07:05.693
Boy, I like a guy
with low standards.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.194
If Faber is setting
the quotas too high,

07:07.294 --> 07:08.929
you got to tell him
he's being unrealistic.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.565
Well, not to mention
just downright silly.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.802
Oh, Dan, cut me off.

07:14.902 --> 07:18.639
Well, somebody needs
to go and talk to Faber.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.341
Somebody needs to
set this guy straight.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.512
Somebody really does.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.213
Well, somebody
doesn't feel like it,

07:26.313 --> 07:28.649
so just forget about it.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.150
Jeez, I mean, you're
talking about a guy

07:30.250 --> 07:31.819
that wants to see
my head mounted

07:31.919 --> 07:34.187
above the woman's restroom.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.989
Forget it!

07:36.089 --> 07:39.727
Roseanne, do you remember
when we were little kids

07:39.827 --> 07:41.629
and we used to go out in the
back yard, way in the corner

07:41.729 --> 07:44.498
so we couldn't see the house,
and we'd imagine what we were

07:44.598 --> 07:46.500
going to do when we grew up?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.937
I was going to own and
operate a chain of pet stores.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.739
And you were going to
go to New York City

07:51.839 --> 07:55.809
and become editor in chief
of Mother Earth News.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.979
So how come 20
years later, we're

07:59.079 --> 08:00.981
sitting in a dive like
this, figuring out

08:01.081 --> 08:04.184
how to hang on to a job
that we hate for $8 an hour,

08:04.284 --> 08:06.887
which we can't even
live off of anyway,

08:06.987 --> 08:08.689
trying to fill quotas
that we can't fill,

08:08.789 --> 08:10.490
because if we don't,
we're going to get canned.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.159
It's--

08:12.259 --> 08:14.094
You got some pretzel
hanging off your chin.

08:27.474 --> 08:28.275
Come in.

08:33.013 --> 08:38.385
Well, you sure keep this place
neater than Booker ever did.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.287
And you got rid of Miss January.

08:40.387 --> 08:43.156
I'm personally
grateful for that.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.958
What do you want, Roseanne?

08:45.058 --> 08:47.227
Well, I was wondering
if we could maybe talk,

08:47.327 --> 08:49.563
you know, like people?

08:49.663 --> 08:51.331
Sure, have yourself
a seat, sugar.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.500
Can I close the door?

08:53.601 --> 08:55.168
Whenever that
door closes, things

08:55.268 --> 08:57.270
tend to slow down out there.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.740
Yeah, well, I guess
you're right about that.

08:59.840 --> 09:00.674
Yeah, you'd know.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.778
What can I do for you?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.780
Well, I was hoping
that maybe this would be

09:06.880 --> 09:11.484
a good time to discuss quotas.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.553
Sure.

09:13.654 --> 09:17.891
OK, you know that new
8,000-unit quota thing?

09:17.991 --> 09:20.393
That's, like, very
difficult. You know, I mean,

09:20.493 --> 09:22.129
it's very difficult.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.330
Uh-huh.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.898
You know, here we are
working eight hours a day,

09:24.998 --> 09:26.967
and we're busting our hump,
and we still come up short,

09:27.067 --> 09:27.868
you know?

09:27.968 --> 09:28.936
We can't do it.

09:29.036 --> 09:33.306
I mean, it's very
demoralizing, you know?

09:33.406 --> 09:34.574
Live with it.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.244
Hey, I'm telling you that
we can't meet our quotas.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.880
And what did you suggest
we do about it, honeybunch?

09:39.980 --> 09:42.015
I suggest you
lower the quotas.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.685
Yeah, then maybe a
couple days a week,

09:44.785 --> 09:47.487
we could all knock off early
and have a factory picnic.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.421
Yeah, like that!

09:51.458 --> 09:55.362
OK, like, you lower
the quotas, OK?

09:55.462 --> 09:58.398
What happens is, like,
then morale goes up.

09:58.498 --> 10:01.168
And then when morale goes
up, I mean, the productivity

10:01.268 --> 10:02.202
increases, you know?

10:02.302 --> 10:03.203
I mean, we look good.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.372
You look good.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.708
I know how business
works, sugar.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.477
You scratch my back,
I scratch your back.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.446
Now, I'm more than willing
to scratch your back.

10:13.546 --> 10:19.586
The big question is, are
you willing to scratch mine?

10:19.687 --> 10:22.322
Now, Mrs. Faber isn't going to
pop out of a closet dressed up

10:22.422 --> 10:26.493
like a Dutch girl, now is she?

10:26.593 --> 10:28.428
That's exactly what
I'm talking about--

10:28.528 --> 10:30.731
disrespect and a smart mouth.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.902
OK, so just cut
to the chase, Faber.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.537
You want the quotas lowered?

10:37.637 --> 10:40.373
I'll lower the quotas.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.175
Thank you very much.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.744
Wait a minute.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.914
I still got an itch.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.983
So lay it on me.
What do you want?

10:55.355 --> 10:57.925
I want you to
modify your behavior.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.027
I don't want you ever
talking back to me.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.029
I don't want to be the
butt of your jokes.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.065
And when you speak to me, I
want you to do it with respect.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.234
And no one but you and
me will ever know we

11:07.334 --> 11:10.470
had this little talk, no one.

11:10.570 --> 11:17.577
Or else the quotas stay up,
and the pink slips go out.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.645
Do we have a deal?

11:31.658 --> 11:33.526
Yes.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.495
Yes, what?

11:35.595 --> 11:43.771
Yes, we have a deal, sir.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.448
What are you going
to do this weekend?

11:55.548 --> 11:56.516
Hey, that's right.

11:56.616 --> 11:57.985
We've got an actual
weekend I don't have

11:58.085 --> 11:59.820
to use to catch up on sleep.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.355
Never thought 6,500 units
would seem like a vacation.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.324
What do you guys got lined up?

12:04.424 --> 12:06.126
Oh, probably just the usual.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.228
I'm going to the science
fair at Lonnie's school.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.131
He made a Brontosaurus
out of egg cartons.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.232
That's weird.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.533
Once when Rosanne was
in school, you made

12:13.633 --> 12:14.501
something out of egg cartons.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.169
What was that?

12:16.269 --> 12:17.404
Stonehenge.

12:23.143 --> 12:26.179
Hey you guys, why don't
we take care of this

12:26.279 --> 12:28.048
before we go on break?

12:28.148 --> 12:30.117
Why don't we take
care of it after work?

12:30.217 --> 12:32.285
Because we're going to
get in a hassle with Faber,

12:32.385 --> 12:33.686
and he's going win.

12:33.787 --> 12:36.289
And life is just too short,
so let's take care of it

12:36.389 --> 12:37.224
and forget about it.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.504
Rosanne, honey,
you know the rule.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.041
No food outside the lunch room.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.843
Oh, this is gum.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.959
Thank you, doll.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.561
I appreciate the cooperation.

13:14.661 --> 13:19.366
And when you're done here, would
you mind putting some paper

13:19.466 --> 13:20.333
towels in the men's room?

13:24.537 --> 13:25.372
No, I don't mind.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.273
Thanks.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.712
What's with you?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.982
Come on, he lowered the quota.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.049
Why push our luck?

13:59.572 --> 14:00.908
Come on, Mom!

14:01.008 --> 14:02.542
Yeah, just five more minutes.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.611
(ANGRILY) No, not
five more minutes.

14:04.711 --> 14:05.845
Not one more minute.

14:05.946 --> 14:06.880
It is 9 o'clock.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.415
9 o'clock is your bedtime.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.849
What does that tell you?

14:09.950 --> 14:10.850
You're ticked off.

14:10.951 --> 14:11.751
Go!

14:14.854 --> 14:17.024
What's all the hubbub, Bub?

14:17.124 --> 14:18.391
You know, they're
your kids, too,

14:18.491 --> 14:21.194
or maybe you just don't even
care what time they go to bed.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.329
They're two minutes late.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.696
What's the big deal?

14:23.796 --> 14:24.932
The big deal is
that they don't

14:25.032 --> 14:27.534
know how to obey the rules.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.601
What's the matter, hun?

14:28.701 --> 14:29.736
Don't call me hun.

14:29.836 --> 14:30.837
Babe, I've been calling
you hun for 15 years--

14:30.938 --> 14:31.972
- Don't call me babe neither!
- Look, lady!

14:37.477 --> 14:38.578
I'm sorry, Dan.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.280
It ain't you.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.281
It's that Faber guy.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.316
God, I hate him.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.753
Want me to beat
him up for you?

14:46.853 --> 14:48.188
No.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.089
Come on, I will.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.426
Well, what would
you do to him?

14:53.526 --> 14:54.794
OK, OK.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.697
Like, um, I'd wait for him by
the bike rack after school.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.634
And then-- and
then you know, I'd

15:01.734 --> 15:03.670
wait for him to come
out of gym class,

15:03.770 --> 15:06.173
and I'd put a bunch
of marbles in my sock.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.376
And I'd say, hey Keith, come on
over to my house after school.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.344
I've got the original cast
recording of "Carousel".

15:15.215 --> 15:18.952
God, I sold my soul to
the devil for 6,500 units!

15:19.052 --> 15:21.154
What the hell are
you talking about?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.223
I made a deal with him.

15:23.323 --> 15:26.493
He said he'd lower the
quota if I lowered myself

15:26.593 --> 15:27.995
and showed him some respect.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.998
But a little has
turned into a lot.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.866
I just can't take it anymore.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.368
Honey, if you're that
miserable, just quit.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.970
It's not worth it.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.071
I can't quit.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.439
Well, you can't
go on like this.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.343
I'm mean, I'd lose everything.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.278
I wouldn't get any
hospitalization.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.913
I couldn't get any
kind of unemployment.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.349
And the kids could
never get sick or grow.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.821
We had kids before
we had hospitalization.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.689
We'll manage.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.559
It will take a long
time to find another job.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.894
We'll manage.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.697
We got married, and they
said we wouldn't make it.

16:04.797 --> 16:05.665
We had three kids.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.134
They said we wouldn't make it.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.269
You know what we're like?

16:09.369 --> 16:11.338
We're like one of
those clown balloons,

16:11.438 --> 16:13.473
that every time you
knock it over it

16:13.573 --> 16:15.808
just turns right side up again.

16:15.908 --> 16:18.778
We'll be OK.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.348
Well, say I quit, OK?

16:21.448 --> 16:24.417
And then Becky comes in her
and she wants a new pair

16:24.517 --> 16:26.786
of designer jeans, OK?

16:26.886 --> 16:28.788
So then what are you
going to tell her?

16:28.888 --> 16:30.823
Well, I'd have to
tell her the truth.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.960
I'd just look her right
in the eye and say, honey,

16:34.061 --> 16:35.262
you know you could
have had those jeans

16:35.362 --> 16:37.497
if your mom hadn't been a
big baby and quit her job.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.336
Supportive?

16:43.436 --> 16:44.537
I think so.

16:44.637 --> 16:45.438
Not.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.482
Rosanne, you know I'm right.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.849
Admit it.

16:56.949 --> 16:58.818
Jackie, did it
ever occur to you

16:58.918 --> 17:01.521
that maybe I just do not
like putting people down all

17:01.621 --> 17:02.422
the time?

17:02.522 --> 17:03.656
No, no.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.425
It did occur to me that
you were losing your touch.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.493
Well, think again.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.760
How about yesterday?

17:07.860 --> 17:10.163
Faber was in here,
throwing his weight around.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.233
You had a golden
opportunity to slam him.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.501
And you didn't.

17:14.601 --> 17:17.837
You stooped to an all-time
low and called him "sir".

17:17.937 --> 17:18.971
Don't remind me.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.373
What's the matter with you?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.809
Jackie, maybe she's going
through something personal.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.411
Oh, yeah, right, Crystal.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.949
Ladies, can I
have your attention?

17:30.049 --> 17:30.850
Sure, Mr. Faber.

17:36.089 --> 17:39.459
I have a little
announcement to make.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.629
Now, plastics is a
competitive industry.

17:42.729 --> 17:43.530
Now let's face it.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.332
We make money selling product.

17:45.432 --> 17:48.335
So it only stands to reason, the
more product we sell, the more

17:48.435 --> 17:49.402
money we're going to make.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.971
So what are you
raising our quotas to?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.807
Nothing you
girls can't handle.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.477
We're going to try 8,000 again.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.114
And I have every confidence that
you girls can cut the mustard.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.916
And if you can't, been
nice working with you.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.291
Can you believe that?

18:11.391 --> 18:12.759
I'll never make that quota.

18:12.859 --> 18:16.429
Come on, Rosanne, I'll
buy you a cup of coffee.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.364
I'll be there in a minute.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.509
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

18:29.609 --> 18:30.843
We had a deal!

18:30.943 --> 18:33.846
The operative word
here, Roseanne, is "had".

18:33.946 --> 18:36.048
Yeah, I know who you are.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.884
I know who you are, and if
you didn't have this job,

18:37.984 --> 18:40.320
you'd be in an alley.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.255
You sound angry, Roseanne.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.691
You told me if I toe'd the
line, you'd drop the quotas.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.193
Why are you doing this?

18:46.293 --> 18:47.427
Because I can.

18:47.527 --> 18:48.928
No, you can't.

18:49.028 --> 18:50.096
I did.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.364
And when I broke
you, I knew you were

18:51.464 --> 18:52.799
just like the rest of them.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.302
And you'll stay and
you'll do your 8,000,

18:55.402 --> 18:58.838
and so will your loser
friends or they're gone.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.507
Well, this ain't the
way you motivate people.

19:00.607 --> 19:01.408
And you know what?

19:01.508 --> 19:03.476
Any manager would know that.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.112
And you are a lot of things,
but you ain't no manager.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.548
Sweetheart, you just bought
yourself a bunch of trouble.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.449
No, sweetheart.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.750
You did.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.219
Hey, I'm not done with you.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.053
Don't you walk away
when I'm talking to you!

19:16.989 --> 19:18.325
You OK, sis?

19:18.425 --> 19:20.360
No, I'm not OK.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.329
I mean, I tried to be OK.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.896
But he doesn't want me to be OK.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.198
He doesn't want
any of us to be OK.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.098
You know why?

19:26.199 --> 19:28.568
Because he's not OK, OK?

19:28.668 --> 19:31.170
(ANGRILY) Roseanne, I told
you not to walk away from me.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.672
I'm walking away
from you, Faber,

19:32.772 --> 19:34.541
and I'm walking away from
this stinking factory.

19:34.641 --> 19:38.211
I'm walking away
from this lousy job.

19:38.311 --> 19:41.681
Well, that was a wonderful
performance, Roseanne.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.650
But if any of you are
considering joining her,

19:43.750 --> 19:46.586
may I point out there are
two doors to this room?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.921
One that pays, and
one that doesn't.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.028
I guess we're
not going to make

20:29.128 --> 20:31.030
our quota today, honeybunch.

20:44.544 --> 20:45.445
Here you go.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.446
Thank you.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.247
I can't believe I did this.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.782
I mean, I'm glad I did it.

20:49.882 --> 20:53.386
But I can't believe I did it.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.288
Ah, so you spilled
the beer nuts.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.357
Big deal.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.258
I can't believe I quit.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.564
You know, I was
at that factory

21:04.664 --> 21:06.766
longer than anybody here.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.802
You know what I'm going to
miss about Wellman most?

21:09.902 --> 21:11.471
Not one damn thing.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.810
I can't believe I quit.

21:17.910 --> 21:21.381
It's high time that we
thank the woman responsible

21:21.481 --> 21:27.119
for our emancipation, my sister,
ex-Wellman employee, and a heck

21:27.219 --> 21:29.288
of a woman in her own right--

21:29.389 --> 21:32.725
what was your name again?

21:32.825 --> 21:33.626
Sally Fields.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.527
ALL: Yay!

21:39.399 --> 21:43.570
[theme music]
