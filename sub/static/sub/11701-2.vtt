00:04.066 --> 00:05.386
Oi! Get here.

00:09.066 --> 00:10.826
Please hurry, it's my dad!

00:10.906 --> 00:12.826
I think he's tried to kill himself.

00:12.906 --> 00:14.346
I told them that I was stressed at work,

00:14.426 --> 00:15.866
so I tried to top myself.

00:15.946 --> 00:17.546
I said exactly what you girls told them.

00:18.346 --> 00:19.666
Bea Smith?

00:21.026 --> 00:22.586
Home sweet home, love.

00:23.946 --> 00:25.306
That bitch is playing with me.

00:25.386 --> 00:26.626
We are gonna come down on her.

00:26.706 --> 00:28.026
Isn't it smarter to negotiate?

00:28.106 --> 00:29.706
We don't negotiate with prisoners.

00:30.346 --> 00:32.586
That Erica, she really pisses me off.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.626
You can't argue with the department. Okay?

00:34.706 --> 00:37.106
- Why are you making me look bad?
- That is not what I'm doing.

00:37.186 --> 00:39.306
So you're just not up to the
job? Is that what I'm hearing?

00:39.386 --> 00:40.866
Hold her still.

00:47.706 --> 00:49.186
Kaiya!

00:58.146 --> 00:59.346
Oh!

01:01.266 --> 01:02.546
Oh!

01:05.746 --> 01:06.986
Meg?

01:07.546 --> 01:09.346
Oh, no, no, no, no...

01:09.946 --> 01:11.906
05 to 01, we need an ambulance.

02:11.306 --> 02:12.746
There were women everywhere.

02:12.826 --> 02:16.226
Kaiya was running at me, I grabbed her,
and then I saw Bea and Mrs. Jackson.

02:17.226 --> 02:19.226
- Were they arguing?
- They were on the ground.

02:30.266 --> 02:31.786
Were there raised voices?

02:31.866 --> 02:34.226
Yeah, course there was. It was a riot.

02:34.746 --> 02:37.426
Did you hear Bea Smith or Mrs. Jackson?

02:38.826 --> 02:41.106
No. There was blood everywhere.

02:41.626 --> 02:43.786
I reckon Mrs. Jackson
had been there a while.

02:44.946 --> 02:47.026
You say that because of the
amount of blood on the floor?

02:47.106 --> 02:48.266
Yeah.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.626
Stand up.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.866
Open your mouth.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.626
Okay, tell us what happened.
You were chasing Kaiya?

03:01.706 --> 03:03.026
I was chasing her.

03:03.106 --> 03:06.746
I was afraid something
might happen to her. Um...

03:07.346 --> 03:10.506
I was running and then I was on the ground.

03:10.786 --> 03:12.426
Kneeling over Mrs. Jackson's body?

03:12.506 --> 03:14.826
I know how this looks, but, I didn't do it.

03:15.026 --> 03:18.626
24 hours earlier, Mrs. Jackson
slotted you for trafficking.

03:18.706 --> 03:20.066
Must have been pretty angry.

03:20.666 --> 03:21.906
No.

03:21.986 --> 03:24.066
We all know what happens
when you get angry, Bea.

03:24.906 --> 03:28.066
You lose control. Like that
night with your husband.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.586
My husband tried to kill himself.

03:31.146 --> 03:32.626
But, the fact remains you're the one with

03:32.706 --> 03:34.466
Mrs. Jackson's blood on your hands.

03:35.466 --> 03:36.626
It wasn't me.

03:36.706 --> 03:38.346
Perhaps it was a spur of the moment thing?

03:39.026 --> 03:41.386
You saw Mrs. Jackson. You had a weapon.

03:41.466 --> 03:43.226
In the commotion, you stabbed her.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.746
No, I didn't kill her.

03:45.346 --> 03:46.546
I didn't. It wasn't me.

04:15.786 --> 04:17.786
Hey. You in on this?

04:19.305 --> 04:20.386
Fan mail.

04:20.466 --> 04:21.826
Oh, can't it wait?

04:22.506 --> 04:23.546
Please.

04:25.746 --> 04:27.186
Franky!

04:32.026 --> 04:34.066
A screw grommet. Shh.

04:34.866 --> 04:36.386
- Are we ready?
- Yeah, what about Franky?

04:36.466 --> 04:40.146
- Oh, she's not doing it.
- Surprise, sur-freaking-prise.

04:40.226 --> 04:41.786
Hey, three's enough.

04:41.866 --> 04:44.426
Attention compound, attention compound.

04:44.506 --> 04:46.306
Count will commence in ten minutes.

04:47.866 --> 04:49.146
Better get a move on.

04:49.226 --> 04:51.106
Whose birthday is it?

04:51.186 --> 04:53.546
Mine!

04:53.626 --> 04:55.666
- And what do you want?
- Hot potato!

04:55.746 --> 04:57.906
- Hot potato!
- Yay!

04:57.986 --> 04:59.826
Hit it, Bea.

04:59.906 --> 05:02.026
Hot potato, hot potato!

05:02.106 --> 05:05.026
Hot potato, hot potato!

05:05.106 --> 05:07.226
Hot potato, hot potato!

05:07.346 --> 05:08.826
Potato!

05:08.906 --> 05:11.386
Potato, potato, potato!

05:12.106 --> 05:14.666
Cold spaghetti, cold spaghetti

05:14.746 --> 05:17.106
Cold spaghetti, cold spaghetti

05:17.186 --> 05:18.906
Spaghetti

05:18.986 --> 05:21.026
Spaghetti, spaghetti, spaghetti!

05:23.226 --> 05:25.106
Happy birthday, Kaiya.

05:26.346 --> 05:28.586
- Aw, happy birthday, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

05:29.586 --> 05:31.266
- How old are you?
- Three.

05:31.546 --> 05:33.506
- Three!
- Three, or five?

05:33.626 --> 05:35.066
Mr. Jackson.

05:35.866 --> 05:37.346
Oh, welcome back.

05:38.186 --> 05:39.986
Oh, so you are here for the head count?

05:40.586 --> 05:41.746
Okay, come on, girls.

05:41.826 --> 05:42.986
Come on, baby girl.

05:43.066 --> 05:44.986
It's little Kaiya's birthday and we...

05:45.066 --> 05:46.906
We all got a bit Wiggly, didn't we, girls?

05:51.706 --> 05:53.586
Well, it's nice to see you, Mr. Jackson.

06:14.306 --> 06:17.946
Miss Bennett, any comment on the
investigation into Mrs. Jackson's death?

06:19.226 --> 06:21.946
- Do the police have a suspect?
- Anybody lockdown?

06:23.786 --> 06:26.426
Miss Bennett. Come on, Miss
Bennett. Give us something.

06:34.306 --> 06:35.866
Four weeks isn't long.

06:36.466 --> 06:38.266
Maybe he's going to be governor.

06:38.586 --> 06:40.466
Miss Bennett's only temporary, isn't she?

06:40.546 --> 06:42.706
- Would they do that?
- Why not?

06:42.786 --> 06:45.066
Uh, 'cause he'd be replacing his dead wife.

06:45.146 --> 06:46.866
- Shh. Booms.
- What?

06:49.706 --> 06:52.306
- I reckon Jacs topped her.
- No-one's talking.

06:52.706 --> 06:54.266
If you did it, would you?

06:54.346 --> 06:56.066
No, it's too big to sit on.

06:56.226 --> 06:58.986
And I am not talking about her arse.

06:59.266 --> 07:01.386
Hey, birthday prezzie for Kaiya.

07:01.466 --> 07:03.426
- From the girls in D-block.
- Aww.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.946
- Aw!
- Oh, thank you!

07:06.026 --> 07:08.346
- She'll love it.
- Yeah. They're not going to last.

07:08.426 --> 07:09.866
- Boomer!
- Put it back.

07:09.946 --> 07:12.826
What? She gets pancakes in
the playroom, we get this crap.

07:12.906 --> 07:14.746
- Fair's fair.
- Boomer, it's her birthday!

07:14.826 --> 07:16.586
She is going to love the zoo, isn't she?

07:16.666 --> 07:18.666
She lives in a bloody zoo.

07:18.746 --> 07:20.146
Shit.

07:21.546 --> 07:22.546
Ah-ha!

07:22.826 --> 07:25.266
Ah! Sit down, before the screw see you.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.946
- Relax.
- You're pinned.

07:28.026 --> 07:30.506
I told you if you're going to do
that crap, you should stay in there.

07:30.626 --> 07:33.026
Could someone please get her
brekkie before they get suss?

07:33.346 --> 07:34.866
Yeah, I'll get it.

07:41.506 --> 07:44.626
- How's the boob?
- Tight. Unlike your face.

07:44.746 --> 07:47.586
Drop by the unit. We're always
happy to pick up where we left off.

07:49.906 --> 07:51.106
Poor old slag.

07:51.186 --> 07:53.346
She keeps hitting on me, I keep saying no.

07:56.946 --> 07:58.266
Mr. Jackson.

07:59.106 --> 08:01.106
I just wanted to say

08:02.386 --> 08:04.786
I'm really sorry about
this thing that's happened.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.146
Yeah, course you are.

08:15.506 --> 08:18.546
- Are you trying to get sprung?
- Stop stressing.

08:19.746 --> 08:20.866
Doreen.

08:20.946 --> 08:23.626
Keep your head down and walk
straight back to the unit.

08:24.426 --> 08:25.946
Hi, Mr. Jackson.

08:26.026 --> 08:27.506
I've got something from Kaiya.

08:29.066 --> 08:30.626
Go on, baby girl.

08:34.025 --> 08:36.905
I helped her with the writing,
but she did the faces on her own.

08:48.346 --> 08:49.466
Who killed my wife?

08:51.386 --> 08:52.826
I... I don't know.

08:57.826 --> 09:01.786
All it takes is one drug bust
and the kid's gone, Doreen.

09:06.506 --> 09:08.306
You stay with Bea Smith.

09:09.146 --> 09:10.986
You've got a day to get me some answers.

09:24.346 --> 09:25.546
I'll get it.

09:28.466 --> 09:29.586
Hello?

09:30.786 --> 09:31.826
Hello.

09:32.506 --> 09:33.506
Bea.

09:35.306 --> 09:36.386
I'd like to...

09:36.946 --> 09:38.186
Can I please speak to Debbie?

09:38.426 --> 09:39.586
She's in her room.

09:39.866 --> 09:41.346
Can you get her for me?

09:43.706 --> 09:45.066
She's locked herself in.

09:45.226 --> 09:47.106
Won't come out. Won't talk, won't eat.

09:47.826 --> 09:49.666
- What have you done?
- What have I done?

09:50.066 --> 09:51.626
Debbie failed her exams.

09:51.786 --> 09:52.826
Shit.

09:52.906 --> 09:54.306
What did you expect?

09:54.546 --> 09:55.986
She's been copping it
from the kids at school.

09:56.066 --> 09:58.306
- She can't hack it.
- Did you speak to the principal?

09:58.386 --> 10:00.306
They're supposed to be looking out for her.

10:00.386 --> 10:01.786
Of course I bloody did!

10:01.866 --> 10:03.786
Please, Harry, just put her on.

10:06.266 --> 10:09.466
Remember what we said? We're
supposed to be keeping things normal.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.386
Deb? Debbie, is that you?

10:14.906 --> 10:16.106
It's not.

10:16.426 --> 10:17.906
Do they record these phone calls?

10:20.426 --> 10:21.466
Bea?

10:21.946 --> 10:23.146
I don't know.

10:26.666 --> 10:28.826
There's a lot we need to talk about, honey.

10:29.706 --> 10:31.266
I'll come for a visit.

10:41.306 --> 10:46.026
Filling in for Mrs. Jackson, even
temporarily, has been a challenge.

10:46.266 --> 10:48.866
So I hope I can, um...

10:49.626 --> 10:52.826
Rely on your support,
uh, again at this time.

10:52.906 --> 10:56.786
Um, I think the additional security
measures I've, we've put in place

10:56.866 --> 10:58.026
are addressing any concerns...

10:58.106 --> 10:59.466
You try walking the compound knowing

10:59.546 --> 11:01.346
there's no guarantee it won't happen again.

11:02.946 --> 11:05.706
- Well, that's why you patrol in pairs.
- All they need is two shivs.

11:06.426 --> 11:09.266
We've refocused the security
cameras on any trouble spots,

11:09.346 --> 11:11.986
keeping an eye on the potential
instigators of the riot.

11:12.946 --> 11:15.106
With the, um, police now off-site,

11:15.186 --> 11:17.986
uh, our focus should
be resettling the women

11:18.066 --> 11:19.426
into some sort of routine.

11:19.746 --> 11:22.426
The GM will be on the compound
over the next few days.

11:23.426 --> 11:25.146
Uh, regarding the, um...

11:26.666 --> 11:29.666
Uh, investigation into the riot,

11:29.786 --> 11:32.146
Mrs. Jackson's death, it's still ongoing.

11:32.746 --> 11:36.066
Uh, at this stage it's unclear
whether it was a murder,

11:36.146 --> 11:38.106
or an unfortunate accident.

11:41.546 --> 11:44.026
Will, welcome back.
Everybody, Will is back.

11:44.106 --> 11:45.266
Welcome back, Will.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.946
Appreciate you coming back onboard, Will.

11:48.786 --> 11:50.746
One thing I'd like to
achieve while I'm here

11:50.826 --> 11:53.586
is getting rid of that
media mob camping outside.

11:53.666 --> 11:55.706
Now, we could put the hose on them,

11:55.786 --> 11:58.146
but I reckon we'd be the ones
getting the spray in the press.

12:00.586 --> 12:03.066
So don't give them anything
they can write about, all right?

12:03.146 --> 12:04.666
Any statements are to come from Vera.

12:05.906 --> 12:07.466
You haven't spoken to them?

12:08.026 --> 12:09.146
Uh, no.

12:09.466 --> 12:11.826
Well, we need to give
them something positive.

12:13.346 --> 12:14.786
So, what have you got?

12:16.586 --> 12:18.426
To give our vocab a bit of a boost,

12:18.546 --> 12:20.946
we'll be practicing some
new words and phrases.

12:21.026 --> 12:23.346
Once you've copied the new phrases out,

12:23.426 --> 12:25.746
we'll be working them
into a longer sentence.

12:27.346 --> 12:28.946
Boomer's got a long sentence.

12:32.226 --> 12:34.226
Okay, back to work.

12:34.626 --> 12:36.386
Steven was one of my first appointments

12:36.466 --> 12:39.626
and he's made incredible progress
with the women's vocab and reading.

12:40.346 --> 12:41.746
Hmm. Good to hear.

12:43.626 --> 12:44.826
Here already.

12:45.106 --> 12:46.306
And this is Franky.

12:47.786 --> 12:49.946
Actually, Franky has just completed her HOC

12:50.026 --> 12:52.946
and that's encouraged a lot of the
other women to enroll in the class.

12:53.026 --> 12:55.986
- Yeah, but I'm your star pupil.
- No one comes even close.

12:57.106 --> 12:59.546
I've been tutoring Franky
for the last 12 months.

12:59.626 --> 13:01.346
Tutoring, dating, same-same.

13:02.026 --> 13:03.226
Very different.

13:04.106 --> 13:05.786
Actually, I have to
postpone today's session.

13:05.866 --> 13:08.906
Oh. Well, I guess I'll just
have to play with myself.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.546
If only we had the Internet, eh?

13:15.106 --> 13:16.106
What do you reckon?

13:16.306 --> 13:17.906
Education is just one element.

13:17.986 --> 13:20.426
There's also the practical.
We have coffee courses,

13:20.506 --> 13:22.746
self-esteem classes, interview techniques.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.866
I want to take this further.

13:25.266 --> 13:27.066
After the lockdown, the
women went a bit stir-crazy,

13:27.146 --> 13:30.626
so I organized dance classes,
which ended up being hugely popular.

13:30.706 --> 13:33.066
Morale increases, incident rate goes down.

13:34.586 --> 13:36.146
I read the report.

13:36.266 --> 13:38.066
We need to empower the women.

13:38.586 --> 13:41.466
And it's also something
positive for the press.

13:44.586 --> 13:45.706
It is.

13:46.906 --> 13:48.426
But the public will be out for blood

13:48.506 --> 13:50.386
if I gave the governor's
job over to someone

13:50.466 --> 13:53.626
whose vision is trotting out
well-groomed dancing baristas

13:53.706 --> 13:55.706
back into society. Hmm?

13:56.626 --> 13:58.186
Glad you didn't deny it.

14:00.186 --> 14:01.666
You want this job, Erica?

14:01.906 --> 14:04.506
You're going to have to
be much smarter than that.

14:32.186 --> 14:34.306
Didn't let me know you were coming back.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.066
You heard anything?

14:37.306 --> 14:40.026
- From the women?
- Women, cops, whoever.

14:40.626 --> 14:41.946
No, mate.

14:42.026 --> 14:43.906
You heard Vera.

14:43.986 --> 14:45.666
Cops still don't know if it was deliberate.

14:45.746 --> 14:48.386
Do me a favor. She had a
knife in her fucking chest.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.186
In the middle of a riot, okay?

14:50.306 --> 14:51.626
Now, we don't know what really happened.

14:51.706 --> 14:54.146
Well, doesn't take a genius to work it out.

15:16.906 --> 15:18.266
Is Debbie here?

15:18.426 --> 15:20.666
The cops are re-interviewing
a bunch of people.

15:20.746 --> 15:22.466
- Why?
- The neighbors.

15:23.106 --> 15:24.666
They dragged in some of the guys from work.

15:24.746 --> 15:27.106
Asking them questions about us.

15:27.906 --> 15:29.546
Our marriage. About me.

15:31.346 --> 15:33.426
Now, you know I don't
like people nosing around.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.066
Where... Where is she?

15:37.386 --> 15:40.226
Does she know I've been calling?
Is she getting my letters?

15:40.346 --> 15:42.986
I'm only here to make sure
we're all on the same page.

15:44.786 --> 15:46.906
We sure as hell can't talk
about it over the phone.

15:46.986 --> 15:48.866
It's been over a month, Harry.

15:49.386 --> 15:51.146
I promised I'd be there for her.

15:51.586 --> 15:53.186
Well, it was a stupid thing to do.

15:53.266 --> 15:54.986
Harry, I have to see my daughter.

15:55.066 --> 15:58.146
It's not going to happen.
So don't start up again.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.666
I'm only doing this for
Debbie, because she begged me.

16:05.826 --> 16:07.826
Nah.

16:09.706 --> 16:11.146
You're doing this for yourself.

16:12.586 --> 16:14.466
You know the cops wouldn't
be talking to everyone again

16:14.546 --> 16:16.786
if they didn't think
something was going on.

16:17.506 --> 16:19.706
You'd rather everyone think
you tried to top yourself

16:19.786 --> 16:22.226
than find out exactly what
type of guy you really are.

16:23.786 --> 16:27.066
No, this is about you,
Harry. It always has been.

16:28.426 --> 16:30.066
Now, Debbie needs me.

16:31.226 --> 16:32.426
And guess what?

16:32.746 --> 16:33.986
I'm still her mother.

16:34.586 --> 16:36.146
But you're not there.

16:37.386 --> 16:39.546
I'm the one who's got
to clean up this mess.

16:39.786 --> 16:41.346
Debbie's been through hell.

16:41.666 --> 16:45.066
And every time you call, things get worse.

16:45.986 --> 16:47.346
She's a wreck.

16:48.986 --> 16:51.546
So stop calling. Stop writing.

16:52.226 --> 16:54.626
Won't you think about
what's best for Debbie?

16:56.226 --> 16:58.826
That's what you should have
done in the first place.

17:03.066 --> 17:04.506
Think about it.

17:23.306 --> 17:25.866
You've got to tell me, Bea.
You've got to say what happened.

17:25.945 --> 17:27.746
- Doreen!
- I'll hurt you.

17:27.826 --> 17:30.226
- I don't want to, but I will.
- Doreen, what are you doing?

17:30.306 --> 17:33.826
You tell me what happened to Mrs. Jackson.

17:33.906 --> 17:35.586
- I didn't see anything!
- You were there!

17:35.666 --> 17:37.546
- You were there, too.
- I didn't see anything.

17:37.626 --> 17:41.346
- Tell me!
- I don't know! I don't know!

17:41.426 --> 17:42.826
Doreen, please!

17:47.786 --> 17:49.266
Bea, I'm sorry...

18:24.386 --> 18:25.786
Have you got it?

18:44.026 --> 18:45.906
- You can't drive.
- I'm fine.

18:45.986 --> 18:47.346
Come back inside.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.986
- I won't be long.
- Hey, you bitch!

18:50.986 --> 18:52.426
Do you want Maccas or not?

18:52.546 --> 18:55.226
All right. Just don't forget the nuggets.

18:58.826 --> 19:00.306
Doreen, what's going on?

19:02.626 --> 19:04.386
Sweetheart, what's happening?

19:10.786 --> 19:13.506
Mr. Jackson. He's going to take her away.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.386
I've got to find out
who killed Mrs. Jackson.

19:16.466 --> 19:19.266
- He reckons you know something.
- Doreen, I don't. I don't know.

19:19.346 --> 19:20.866
You've got to tell him,
or he'll take Kaiya.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.106
- How?
- He'll plant something.

19:23.706 --> 19:26.986
Ah, look, if they find drugs in
here, Kaiya's out of jail for good.

19:27.946 --> 19:30.546
Kaiya was right there and
he said he'd get rid of her.

19:30.666 --> 19:32.746
- Right to her face.
- Now listen to me.

19:33.626 --> 19:34.786
Listen.

19:35.066 --> 19:36.146
He can't do that.

19:36.226 --> 19:37.986
Right? So I'm going to go
and talk to the governor...

19:38.106 --> 19:39.666
No, no, no. You can't tell the governor.

19:39.786 --> 19:42.506
If he finds out that I
dobbed, he'll take her away.

19:45.306 --> 19:47.866
Please. I can't stuff up again.

20:09.666 --> 20:12.346
Mr. Jackson, can I have a word?

20:14.066 --> 20:16.746
Look, I didn't do it.

20:18.066 --> 20:20.226
Mrs. Jackson, she was already gone when...

20:23.426 --> 20:26.306
I've given my statement to
the police. They've cleared me.

20:27.946 --> 20:31.026
Doreen, she'd do anything for Kaiya.

20:31.346 --> 20:33.866
Anything. But she's not up to helping.

20:34.226 --> 20:36.346
If you didn't do it, find out who did.

20:38.226 --> 20:39.226
Hey, let me go.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.786
A night in the slot
should help you remember.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.026
- I didn't do anything!
- Move!

20:42.106 --> 20:44.386
All right, stop! Let her go.

20:46.466 --> 20:48.226
Let her go, Mr. Jackson.

20:53.066 --> 20:54.466
Go back to your unit.

20:58.146 --> 20:59.866
Mate, you're way out of line.

21:00.066 --> 21:01.346
They know who did it.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.546
Even if they do, you think
they're going to tell you, huh?

21:03.626 --> 21:05.386
Well, I'll make them.

21:05.466 --> 21:07.986
If Vera or Channing see you
like this, you'll be out.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.786
- I need the rest of that CCTV.
- There's nothing else, mate. That was it.

21:10.866 --> 21:13.106
- There was nothing on it.
- I've already stuck my neck out.

21:13.186 --> 21:16.026
- Now, let the cops handle it.
- The cops are doing jack shit!

21:16.106 --> 21:18.106
You need to go home and calm down.

21:18.186 --> 21:19.586
Those bitches are going
to get away with it!

21:19.666 --> 21:21.346
Well, while you are like this,
you're not helping anyone,

21:21.426 --> 21:23.826
are you, huh? You're not.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.266
Fuck this.

21:33.866 --> 21:38.306
I know. It's okay. Hey, go home. Yeah?

21:38.386 --> 21:40.946
I'll cover for you, all right?

21:41.346 --> 21:42.426
Go on.

21:43.146 --> 21:44.506
Go, mate. Go.

21:58.586 --> 22:00.746
Aw!

22:00.986 --> 22:03.226
I love your new teddy. Is
that a present from Grandma?

22:03.306 --> 22:06.026
- Yep.
- Aw, can he be my friend, too?

22:06.946 --> 22:08.986
Did you see the bears in the zoo?

22:09.826 --> 22:11.906
- And the tigers?
- Yes.

22:12.026 --> 22:14.106
Yeah? And what noise do tigers make?

22:14.186 --> 22:16.626
- Roar!
- They go roar!

22:16.746 --> 22:19.626
- Can you keep it down?
- Oh, we're playing.

22:19.706 --> 22:20.986
Yeah, well, I'm trying to sleep.

22:21.066 --> 22:23.626
- Aw, it's not even 7:00.
- Do I give a fuck?

22:24.106 --> 22:25.426
Just shut up.

22:26.026 --> 22:27.586
Kaiya wants to tell you about the zoo.

22:27.666 --> 22:29.946
I don't give a fuck about the fucking zoo.

22:30.026 --> 22:31.786
Please, I'm just trying to sleep.

22:33.106 --> 22:34.866
Baby girl, why don't you
go and find Auntie Liz, hmm?

22:34.946 --> 22:36.746
She'll give you a bickie. Come on.

22:46.786 --> 22:49.626
- It's her birthday, Toni.
- Just shut up.

22:49.706 --> 22:52.146
She's been freaked out for
weeks about those police dogs.

22:52.226 --> 22:54.186
She deserves a bit of fun,
but you're so off your face

22:54.266 --> 22:55.706
all the time you don't even care.

22:55.786 --> 22:57.066
Helped out with the cake, didn't I?

22:57.146 --> 22:58.466
She needs looking after.

22:59.186 --> 23:02.026
How about you just relax, stop
acting like her bloody mum?

23:03.706 --> 23:06.226
Well, if you were a proper
mum, I wouldn't have to.

23:06.306 --> 23:08.146
Oh, come on, you love it.

23:08.226 --> 23:09.586
You fucked up with your own kid

23:09.666 --> 23:11.626
and now you're stealing mine
to make yourself feel better.

23:14.186 --> 23:15.786
Truth hurts, don't it?

24:30.586 --> 24:31.626
Thank you.

24:32.066 --> 24:34.866
Vera, I need some signatures
for these incident reports.

24:34.946 --> 24:36.426
Right, add them to the pile.

24:36.946 --> 24:38.986
Now, hopefully by the time
I get through all of this,

24:39.066 --> 24:40.386
the media will have gone.

24:40.506 --> 24:42.146
Just give them a sound bite.
That's all they're after.

24:42.226 --> 24:43.746
No, I can't.

24:43.826 --> 24:47.746
The whole idea of facing
cameras and recorders, and...

24:49.106 --> 24:51.466
- It's part of the job.
- Yeah, which everybody hated.

24:51.546 --> 24:52.866
Meg hated it, Dalton hated it.

24:52.946 --> 24:56.906
I don't remember a governor who didn't.
And even if I could go out there,

24:56.986 --> 24:58.666
I would have no idea what to say.

24:58.746 --> 25:00.786
You need to get the police
back and authorize a ramp now.

25:00.866 --> 25:03.386
- What?
- Look, they didn't give me her bracelet.

25:05.226 --> 25:08.066
When they buried her, they gave me
her wedding ring, but no bracelet.

25:08.146 --> 25:10.826
She was wearing it the day
she died. She always wore it.

25:10.906 --> 25:12.426
The police have already
searched the compound.

25:12.506 --> 25:14.146
But they didn't know what
they were looking for!

25:14.866 --> 25:17.146
Okay, whoever killed
Meg took that bracelet.

25:17.226 --> 25:18.626
Are you sure it's not at home?

25:18.706 --> 25:21.666
She was wearing it the last time
I saw her. It went missing here.

25:23.946 --> 25:26.426
A ramp is going to cost a
fortune in staff and clean up

25:26.506 --> 25:28.466
- and the effect on the women...
- We're talking about

25:28.546 --> 25:31.266
the fucker who killed Meg!
Don't you want to find her?

25:33.586 --> 25:36.746
- Of course I do.
- Then authorize a ramp.

25:56.266 --> 25:58.826
No, you're doing the right thing.

26:12.386 --> 26:14.266
Bernadette, it's Erica Davidson.

26:14.866 --> 26:17.626
Yeah. Yeah, it has been a while.

26:19.426 --> 26:21.026
So, that favor you owe me.

26:45.426 --> 26:47.746
It's okay, baby girl. It's okay.

26:49.346 --> 26:51.626
I don't like the dogs.

26:51.746 --> 26:53.546
Baby girl.

26:54.986 --> 26:57.186
I don't like them, Doreen.

26:57.266 --> 26:58.386
Aw!

27:07.586 --> 27:08.786
They find it?

27:09.906 --> 27:11.946
Why can't they do their
fucking jobs properly?

27:12.026 --> 27:13.906
It's probably been flushed, okay?

27:13.986 --> 27:15.746
Are they doing strip searches?

27:15.826 --> 27:17.066
Will, you've got to stop this, mate.

27:17.226 --> 27:19.426
They need to do internals.

27:19.506 --> 27:21.466
- I've got to tell Vera...
- Vera's under enough pressure, okay?

27:21.546 --> 27:23.906
- Screaming at her isn't going to help you.
- Get your hands off me.

27:23.986 --> 27:25.426
Listen, mate, you need
to calm down, all right?

27:25.506 --> 27:26.786
- You need to calm...
- Get the fuck off me!

27:26.866 --> 27:28.226
Hey...

27:54.946 --> 27:56.906
She's gunning for your job, mate.

27:59.626 --> 28:01.186
I thought she was my friend.

28:01.266 --> 28:03.946
Erica eats friends for breakfast
and shits them out at lunch.

28:04.026 --> 28:07.386
I know I'm not as good as Meg, but
I could be if they gave me a chance.

28:07.466 --> 28:08.906
In my view, you wouldn't be acting governor

28:08.986 --> 28:10.906
unless they thought you
were up for it, okay?

28:12.026 --> 28:13.786
Excuse me.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.146
Sorry...

28:15.226 --> 28:18.386
Vera, I am so sorry.
I've only just seen this.

28:21.546 --> 28:24.466
You know what the press are like.
They're looking for an angle, that's all.

28:24.546 --> 28:26.146
Tell me you didn't have
anything to do with it.

28:27.666 --> 28:29.466
- What? Vera...
- Sorry.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.786
Sorry. Look, this is the
last thing I need right now.

28:32.866 --> 28:33.946
Yeah, I understand, but...

28:34.026 --> 28:36.386
Vera. What's this about a ramp last night?

28:36.466 --> 28:39.066
I didn't have a choice, sir. Will
came to me with fresh evidence.

28:39.146 --> 28:41.946
- Which failed to materialize.
- I still felt I had to authorize it.

28:42.026 --> 28:44.746
This isn't going to do your
budget any favors, you know that?

28:44.826 --> 28:46.786
- No.
- No.

28:49.066 --> 28:50.426
Erica.

28:51.786 --> 28:52.866
I'm sorry.

28:56.906 --> 28:58.706
- Are you serious about this?
- Yes, I am.

28:58.786 --> 29:01.866
And from what I heard on talkback this
morning, the response has been positive.

29:01.946 --> 29:04.706
It's a vague promise that your
programs will provide public safety.

29:04.786 --> 29:08.226
I see it as a clear vision for
the future direction of Wentworth.

29:09.786 --> 29:11.506
I've got the commissioner
breathing down my neck,

29:11.586 --> 29:12.946
and he's being pressured by the minister.

29:13.026 --> 29:16.506
Look, this prison is more
than just your programs.

29:16.586 --> 29:17.946
It's a business.

29:18.026 --> 29:20.786
And ultimately, we're
answerable to the public.

29:20.866 --> 29:21.986
I understand.

29:23.066 --> 29:25.306
You haven't worked your way through
the ranks. Earned your stripes.

29:25.386 --> 29:27.706
I have a double degree
in law and social work.

29:27.786 --> 29:29.946
I'm well aware of your background.

29:30.266 --> 29:32.666
But your work here over the last
18 months has been in a bumble.

29:33.786 --> 29:35.506
This... This is my work.

29:36.226 --> 29:38.306
This is the first positive
press we've had in months,

29:38.386 --> 29:41.746
because I've come up with a strategy
that's palatable to the public.

29:41.826 --> 29:45.346
Yeah, I know. They don't want to hear
about rehabilitation and what it costs.

29:45.426 --> 29:47.306
They want to know that
the criminals are locked up

29:47.386 --> 29:49.146
and they can sleep safely at night.

29:49.226 --> 29:51.466
So I am selling it to
them as money well spent

29:51.546 --> 29:54.306
to ensure their safety
when the women are released.

29:57.746 --> 29:59.026
I'm listening.

29:59.986 --> 30:03.866
I've spent years finding effective
solutions for civil disputes.

30:04.426 --> 30:08.106
I can mediate, strategize,
communicate and manage.

30:08.186 --> 30:11.586
This is experience you do not
get from patrolling a compound.

30:12.186 --> 30:15.426
I will reduce incident rates and
change public opinion of Wentworth.

30:16.746 --> 30:18.986
And when the government's
opinion poll bounces back

30:19.066 --> 30:22.066
and the commissioner stops
breathing down your neck,

30:22.146 --> 30:24.346
you are more than
welcome to buy me a drink.

30:26.666 --> 30:29.506
Franky? Mail.

30:31.586 --> 30:32.746
Look at this.

30:32.826 --> 30:34.906
Reality TV fans.

30:34.986 --> 30:37.546
Man, they need to get a
life. Look at that. Hundreds.

30:38.546 --> 30:40.546
- Hmm.
- Phew. A spike in numbers.

30:40.706 --> 30:42.186
None for you, darling.

30:42.266 --> 30:44.546
Bea, we need to get a move on
if you want to use the phone.

30:45.626 --> 30:46.986
I think I'll give it a miss today.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.626
Okay.

30:54.706 --> 30:56.146
You all right, Bea?

30:58.626 --> 31:00.266
Want a cuppa?

31:02.266 --> 31:03.746
One sugar, right?

31:10.226 --> 31:13.426
Look, I'm really, really,
really sorry about yesterday.

31:16.186 --> 31:18.626
Mate, you were fighting for your
kid. I would have done the same thing.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.306
- Yeah.
- How is Kaiya?

31:20.986 --> 31:23.506
Oh, she's still a bit
sucky. She hates the dogs.

31:24.106 --> 31:26.986
- How long have you looked after her?
- Since she was two.

31:27.666 --> 31:29.706
Toni made me carer when she couldn't cope.

31:30.226 --> 31:31.466
She's a gorgeous kid.

31:31.546 --> 31:33.626
Yeah. I wanted to make things right.

31:34.306 --> 31:36.346
I wasn't there for my baby, so I figured...

31:36.426 --> 31:38.786
- You know, I should be there for her.
- Mmm.

31:38.866 --> 31:40.066
Where's your baby?

31:43.386 --> 31:44.466
She died.

31:52.506 --> 31:55.106
Poor kid had no chance
with a mother like that.

31:55.426 --> 31:56.906
We'll have to induce her.

32:02.986 --> 32:05.026
I had an accident when I was pregnant.

32:05.106 --> 32:07.786
Hurt people in another
car. That's why I'm here.

32:12.146 --> 32:13.546
I killed my baby.

32:14.826 --> 32:17.266
- Oh, Doreen, I'm sure you didn't kill...
- No, no, no. I did.

32:17.346 --> 32:19.546
I was trashed. I just wanted to have fun.

32:22.386 --> 32:24.466
You know, they said I
still had to give birth

32:24.546 --> 32:26.346
even though she was dead.

32:27.466 --> 32:28.786
I didn't believe them.

32:31.466 --> 32:33.866
I could still feel her move when I moved.

32:42.346 --> 32:45.666
Then I saw her after she was born.

32:49.146 --> 32:50.186
Our little girl.

32:57.066 --> 32:59.106
She just looked like she was asleep.

33:00.266 --> 33:03.906
And I remember thinking, maybe if I
can slap her on the back or something

33:03.986 --> 33:05.226
to wake her up.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.306
But they just wrapped
her all nice in a blanket.

33:13.106 --> 33:14.466
Then they covered her face.

33:18.626 --> 33:20.466
It's good coming in here.

33:21.146 --> 33:22.386
Got me straight.

33:24.346 --> 33:25.866
Then I met Kaiya.

33:27.186 --> 33:29.426
She just smiled at me.

33:30.106 --> 33:32.426
And I felt like I had a
second chance, you know?

33:34.306 --> 33:37.626
For the last few months
she's been struggling a bit.

33:39.546 --> 33:41.226
Oh, maybe you're right.

33:42.746 --> 33:45.106
Maybe this isn't a place for a kid.

33:45.986 --> 33:48.546
I mean, how do you even know if
you're doing the right thing for them?

33:49.546 --> 33:50.546
Hmm.

33:51.026 --> 33:53.386
I don't think you ever really know. Just...

33:53.786 --> 33:55.466
Just do what feels right in your gut.

33:57.506 --> 33:59.546
- You're so full of shit.
- What?

34:00.306 --> 34:03.266
That's not what you're doing to
Debbie. You've stopped calling her.

34:04.306 --> 34:07.066
She's been through enough already. I
can't keep putting her through anymore.

34:07.146 --> 34:08.946
Your gut says to keep calling her, right?

34:09.025 --> 34:11.786
- Yeah, but it's just not fair on her.
- You're her mum.

34:13.906 --> 34:15.666
She loves you, and you've given up.

34:16.666 --> 34:18.146
How do you reckon she feels?

34:25.786 --> 34:28.906
And then under, so you get the
blue and then you do the white.

34:32.186 --> 34:34.666
- Screws found what they were looking for?
- How would I know?

34:35.666 --> 34:37.466
You have your little meetings.

34:37.626 --> 34:39.626
I'm a peer worker, not a dog.

34:40.146 --> 34:42.226
Doubt they'll find what
they're looking for now.

34:42.306 --> 34:44.985
Riots, all that chaos.
Anything could happen.

34:45.065 --> 34:47.186
Trying to make sense
of it later? No chance.

34:48.226 --> 34:50.985
I was in my unit. I have witnesses.

34:51.386 --> 34:53.186
Besides, I never get my hands dirty.

34:53.266 --> 34:54.746
Well, you did with Franky.

34:55.266 --> 34:57.626
Well, I always make an
exception for Francesca.

34:58.466 --> 35:01.466
- Where is the bean flicker?
- She's answering her fan mail.

35:01.546 --> 35:03.386
If they could see her now!

35:05.066 --> 35:07.666
Hey, Mr. Fletcher. Ooh,
where'd you get the boo-boo?

35:10.746 --> 35:12.146
A cricket match.

35:12.826 --> 35:14.586
You always were a shit batsman.

35:15.666 --> 35:17.546
Actually, that was your shit bowling.

35:19.786 --> 35:22.426
- Drinking the weekend?
- Only if you're paying.

35:27.906 --> 35:30.946
Mate, you cannot keep doing
this to yourself, you know.

35:38.746 --> 35:40.706
That's a pretty picture, baby girl.

35:40.786 --> 35:42.346
- Thank you.
- Aw.

35:58.146 --> 36:00.626
I hope there's no fucking
animal noises tonight.

36:02.066 --> 36:04.186
Relax, she's heard it before.

36:04.866 --> 36:06.506
You want to help us draw?

36:07.346 --> 36:09.146
Do I look like I want to draw?

36:13.626 --> 36:15.146
This is good shit.

36:15.906 --> 36:17.826
- Where'd you get it?
- Why do you care?

36:17.946 --> 36:20.426
Because I'll bloody kill
whoever gave it to you.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.026
The Smack Fairy.

36:35.506 --> 36:36.706
Toni...

36:38.386 --> 36:40.706
- What?
- Do us a favor.

36:41.946 --> 36:44.146
Nip down to H-4. Martha owes me rollies.

36:44.946 --> 36:46.746
Do it yourself. I'm off my face.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.226
I'll give you half.

36:51.266 --> 36:52.706
Half?

36:54.946 --> 36:56.426
Yeah, all right.

37:05.506 --> 37:07.026
Hold up. Toni.

37:07.106 --> 37:08.386
- I've got to go to the toilet.
- Come here.

37:08.466 --> 37:10.786
- Come here.
- I've got to go to the bathroom.

37:16.106 --> 37:18.826
You're pinned, aren't you,
eh? Off your fucking head.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.586
I'm going to do you a favor, okay?

37:20.666 --> 37:22.306
I won't search you here
in front of your daughter,

37:22.386 --> 37:24.946
but you're going to walk quietly
with me out of here, all right?

37:25.026 --> 37:26.186
Let's go.

37:26.666 --> 37:27.746
Gab, take over.

37:31.146 --> 37:32.746
Grab your rucksack, sweetheart.

37:33.546 --> 37:36.706
- Are we going to Grandma's?
- Yeah, we're going to Grandma's.

37:39.946 --> 37:42.266
- It's going to be a long visit this time.
- Okay.

38:03.786 --> 38:05.626
Erica. I've got to talk to you.

38:05.706 --> 38:07.266
- Not now, Steven.
- It's important.

38:07.346 --> 38:08.906
- Steven, please. Not now.
- You've got to help me.

38:15.626 --> 38:18.426
I did something stupid. She
swore she wouldn't get caught.

38:18.506 --> 38:21.386
- I never would have done this...
- What are you talking about?

38:21.466 --> 38:22.866
Toni Goodes.

38:23.946 --> 38:25.986
We had an arrangement.

38:26.626 --> 38:28.586
It was only a few times, I swear.

38:29.266 --> 38:30.706
You supplied her?

38:35.786 --> 38:37.346
Well, I wasn't good enough.

38:38.986 --> 38:41.586
Um, it's always a difficult situation.

38:42.586 --> 38:45.186
The department decided to
take things in a new direction.

38:47.386 --> 38:48.586
Well, I tried my best.

38:48.666 --> 38:50.946
Your contribution won't go unnoticed, Vera.

38:52.346 --> 38:54.106
You will be reinstated as deputy.

38:57.546 --> 38:59.866
You're going to make a career
change. Do I make myself clear?

38:59.946 --> 39:01.746
- What if it gets out?
- It won't. I'll make it go away.

39:01.826 --> 39:03.986
Now get your things and leave the prison.

39:04.466 --> 39:05.866
- I'm sorry.
- Get out.

39:10.386 --> 39:11.546
Erica.

39:17.826 --> 39:19.066
You look nervous.

39:21.546 --> 39:23.786
Franky, you're going to want to see this.

39:24.906 --> 39:27.866
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming today.

39:27.946 --> 39:30.706
I have an announcement regarding
the permanent appointment of,

39:30.786 --> 39:33.426
governor for Wentworth Correction Center.

39:33.506 --> 39:36.466
But firstly, I'd like to thank Vera
Bennett very much for her hard work

39:36.546 --> 39:38.186
and commitment during the last few days.

39:38.266 --> 39:39.986
She looks nice, doesn't she?

39:41.346 --> 39:43.586
Now, may I introduce to you all

39:44.386 --> 39:45.826
Wentworth's new governor,

39:46.666 --> 39:48.026
Erica Davidson.

39:49.146 --> 39:51.706
Well...

39:51.786 --> 39:54.506
I'd like to thank the department,
in particular Mr. Channing,

39:54.586 --> 39:55.866
for their faith in me.

39:55.946 --> 39:58.146
I realize it's been a
tough time for everybody,

39:58.226 --> 40:00.746
and my first task as governor
will be to stabilize the prison

40:00.826 --> 40:02.906
for the sake of the women and the officers.

40:02.986 --> 40:05.946
Obviously, I have strong
views about rehabilitation

40:06.026 --> 40:07.866
and I will be making changes.

40:08.426 --> 40:11.346
But my primary concern is public safety.

40:11.906 --> 40:14.066
I want you to be able
to walk down the street,

40:14.146 --> 40:17.906
take your children to the park and
not worry about what might happen.

40:18.706 --> 40:20.226
To feel comfortable and not afraid

40:20.306 --> 40:22.586
if you come across one of our
women in your day-to-day lives.

40:24.386 --> 40:27.746
The changes I will make puts
community safety as a priority.

40:29.186 --> 40:30.306
Thank you.

40:30.386 --> 40:32.306
Miss Davidson, how will
you ensure public safety?

41:33.906 --> 41:35.186
Mum?

41:35.946 --> 41:37.426
Yeah, it's me.
