<i>My grandfather, King George-</i>

<i>he take'em me walkabout...</i>

<i>Grandfather teach'em me</i>

<i>Tell'em story.</i>

02:02.403 --> 02:05.668
<i>That day I down the billabong.</i>

<i>King George-he teach me how</i>
<i>to catch'em fish using magic song.</i>

02:12.813 --> 02:16.840
<i>See, I not blackfella.</i>
<i>I not white fella either.</i>

02:16.917 --> 02:19.408
<i>Them white fellas call me mixed-blood...</i>

02:20.921 --> 02:23.219
- <i>half-caste-</i>
- Yea!

02:23.290 --> 02:25.758
<i>creamy.</i>

02:25.826 --> 02:28.761
- <i>Hyah!</i>
- <i>I belong no one.</i>

02:28.829 --> 02:31.855
<i>That day I see'em them white fellas.</i>

02:31.932 --> 02:34.628
<i>They were pushing</i>
<i>them cheeky bulls across the river...</i>

02:34.702 --> 02:37.603
<i>onto Carney land.</i>

02:41.942 --> 02:45.708
<i>King George angry at them white fellas.</i>

02:47.214 --> 02:51.776
<i>King George say</i>
<i>them white fella bad spirit.</i>

02:51.852 --> 02:54.480
<i>Must be taken from this land.</i>

03:20.481 --> 03:22.142
<i>Shh.</i>

04:13.200 --> 04:15.191
Coppers.

04:15.269 --> 04:17.065
<i>Them coppers come take me away.</i>

04:17.137 --> 04:20.039
<i>They want to put me</i>
<i>on that Mission Island.</i>

04:21.608 --> 04:24.737
<i>Make me into a white fella.</i>

04:27.281 --> 04:29.806
<i>But they're not coppers.</i>

04:31.152 --> 04:33.677
Whoa there. Whoa. Whoa.

04:36.790 --> 04:40.248
<i>And that first time I saw her-</i>

04:40.327 --> 04:42.318
<i>that Mrs. Boss.</i>

04:42.396 --> 04:46.332
<i>The strangest woman I ever seen.</i>

04:46.400 --> 04:48.664
<i>She's not from this land.</i>

04:52.706 --> 04:56.904
<i>This land my people</i>
<i>got many names for...</i>

04:56.977 --> 04:58.968
<i>but white fellas call it...</i>

05:00.748 --> 05:02.739
<i>Australia.</i>

05:05.286 --> 05:07.652
<i>But this story not begin that day.</i>

05:07.721 --> 05:13.091
<i>This story begin a little while ago</i>
<i>in a land far, far away.</i>

05:13.160 --> 05:16.357
<i>That land called England.</i>

05:22.203 --> 05:25.229
My husband must sell Faraway Downs.

05:25.306 --> 05:28.707
<i>But the offer from</i>
<i>this "Cattle King,"Mr. Carney...</i>

05:28.776 --> 05:31.108
is only one-sixth
of what it was once worth.

05:31.178 --> 05:33.112
We need the money, Ramsden.

05:33.180 --> 05:35.705
But Maitland
is just about to muster the fats.

05:35.783 --> 05:37.080
What?

05:37.151 --> 05:39.119
Get the-the big cows ready for market.

05:39.186 --> 05:41.120
<i>Ramsden, you and I both know...</i>

05:41.188 --> 05:45.352
there is only one reason my husband
has spent so much time down under...

05:45.426 --> 05:48.054
and it has absolutely nothing
to do with cows.

05:48.128 --> 05:50.995
At least not of the animal variety.

05:51.065 --> 05:53.260
Lady Ashley,
I-I do think that's a bit harsh.

05:53.334 --> 05:56.394
- Oh, Ramsden, drink your tea.
- Lady Ashley!

05:56.470 --> 05:59.303
<i>What do you intend to do?</i>

05:59.373 --> 06:01.568
I intend to travel
to this cattle station...

06:01.642 --> 06:03.337
sell it...

06:03.410 --> 06:05.935
and bring Maitland home myself!

06:06.013 --> 06:09.505
<i>But, Lady Ashley, it's Australia.</i>

06:09.817 --> 06:13.480
<i>Darling Sarah, I implore you, do not travel.</i>

06:13.554 --> 06:15.613
<i>Outbreak of war imminent. Stop.</i>

06:15.689 --> 06:19.489
<i> Maitland, your concern</i>
<i>regarding war duly noted. Stop.</i>

06:19.560 --> 06:21.528
<i>Have plan concerning cattle.</i>

06:21.595 --> 06:24.029
<i>Sale to King Carney not necessary.</i>

06:24.098 --> 06:27.590
- <i>Need more time. Stop.</i>
- <i> Nonsense. Stop.</i>

06:27.668 --> 06:32.037
<i>Expect contract for sale of station</i>
<i>to be drawn by time of my arrival. Stop.</i>

06:32.106 --> 06:35.269
<i>Cannot meet you. Stop.
Am mustering. Stop.</i>

06:35.342 --> 06:38.709
<i>Have sent trusted man. Stop.</i>
<i>The Drover. Stop.</i>

06:40.447 --> 06:42.438
The Drover?

06:52.726 --> 06:56.526
<i>Drover, you boong lover.</i>

07:01.235 --> 07:03.499
Any of you other Carney boys
want to have a go?

07:08.309 --> 07:12.405
Come on, fellas.
Don't let fear stand in your way.

07:13.547 --> 07:14.912
I'll have ya.

07:16.417 --> 07:19.250
Hey! No boongs in here!

07:19.320 --> 07:22.687
He's not in the pub, Ivan.

07:24.591 --> 07:27.492
<i> Go on.</i>

07:27.561 --> 07:31.998
<i>Run after your boong friend, 'cause as far</i>
<i>as this town's concerned, you</i> are <i>a black.</i>

07:32.066 --> 07:34.500
You work with them,
you eat with them...

07:34.568 --> 07:36.502
and you sleep with them.

07:36.570 --> 07:38.538
Oh, crikey.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.541
When you see her, wave your hat.

07:54.455 --> 07:56.821
What are you waiting for, an invitation?

07:58.325 --> 08:00.316
I hate coming to town.

08:03.364 --> 08:06.026
Lady Sarah Ashley.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.934
A genuine aristocrat
living right here in Darwin.

08:10.003 --> 08:11.766
Administrator, we're at war.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.306
Oh.

08:13.374 --> 08:15.239
<i>As the officer...</i>

08:15.309 --> 08:17.971
<i>in charge of livestock purchases</i>
<i>for the armed forces-</i>

08:18.045 --> 08:21.208
- She's quite a looker.
- <i>I fail to see...</i>

08:21.281 --> 08:24.148
what Lady Sarah Ashley...

08:24.218 --> 08:28.245
<i>has to do with Carney's stranglehold</i>
<i>of the beef industry.</i>

08:28.322 --> 08:30.620
<i>Her husband, Lord Ashley...</i>

08:30.691 --> 08:33.784
claims he's mustering fats
at Faraway Downs.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.828
- <i>Faraway Downs?</i>
- Faraway Downs.

08:35.895 --> 08:38.922
The only cattle station
in the whole of the north...

08:38.999 --> 08:42.594
not owned by Leslie "King" Carney.

08:42.669 --> 08:45.505
- Lord Maitland Ashley
is mustering on Faraway Downs?

08:45.506 --> 08:46.765
<i> Yeah, yeah.</i>

08:46.840 --> 08:50.435
- Isn't quite what we had in mind, is it, Neil?
- <i>No. Yeah.</i>

08:50.511 --> 08:53.105
And now his missus has arrived
on the flying boat.

08:53.180 --> 08:57.014
<i>Doesn't look like they're gonna sell</i>
<i>Faraway Downs to me, Neil.</i>

08:57.084 --> 08:59.018
Ah, she won't last.

08:59.086 --> 09:03.022
A delicate English rose withers
in the outback. Hmm.

09:03.090 --> 09:04.421
You with me?

09:04.491 --> 09:06.823
If you must know, I am to be met-

09:06.894 --> 09:09.954
by my husband's trusted man,
a Mr. Drover.

09:10.030 --> 09:11.463
The bloody Drover?

09:14.835 --> 09:17.463
Bring it. Yes.

09:17.538 --> 09:20.029
Move it.

09:20.107 --> 09:24.305
Look at my wife and daughter down there
giving her the royal welcome.

09:24.378 --> 09:27.677
My fiancÃ©, Neil Fletcher,
manages Faraway Downs.

09:28.882 --> 09:30.873
Good day.

09:32.586 --> 09:35.111
A bit pale.

09:35.189 --> 09:38.283
Not a bad-looking sheila,
but what's the story on the luggage?

09:38.358 --> 09:41.191
Wants to settle down
in the outback, does she?

09:41.261 --> 09:46.198
<i>If she stays and Lord Ashley manages to</i>
<i>get his cattle down onto that wharfthere...</i>

09:46.266 --> 09:49.497
<i>then we've got a competitor</i>
<i>for the army contract, Neil.</i>

09:49.570 --> 09:53.734
<i>Carney's control of every</i>
<i>cattle station in the north...</i>

09:53.807 --> 09:57.709
jeopardizes the supply of <i>beef</i>
to our troops.

09:57.778 --> 10:01.475
But it's a poor war that doesn't make
a decent patriot rich, so...

10:01.548 --> 10:04.915
<i>I don't want a single beast</i>
<i>from Faraway Downs...</i>

10:04.985 --> 10:08.477
to set a hoof on that wharf.

10:10.290 --> 10:15.193
- You with me, Neil?
- Yeah, yeah. Nature will take its course.

10:19.233 --> 10:20.894
<i>What about the missus?</i>

10:20.968 --> 10:23.903
No, I've arranged for someone special
to give her the old scenic route.

10:26.507 --> 10:28.202
Give her a taste of the outback.

10:28.275 --> 10:30.334
No!

10:32.613 --> 10:35.173
- <i> Who's taking her?</i>
- The Drover.

10:39.686 --> 10:41.620
The Drover?

10:41.688 --> 10:45.624
<i>Enjoy the ride, sweetheart.</i>

10:51.798 --> 10:54.096
I'm Sarah Ashley.

10:57.671 --> 10:59.639
My husband, Lord Ashley...

10:59.706 --> 11:02.072
has sent a trusted man to collect me.

11:02.142 --> 11:03.575
<i>A, uh-A Mr. Drover.</i>

11:05.546 --> 11:08.572
It seems as if he has been waylaid.

11:10.617 --> 11:12.312
No women.

11:12.386 --> 11:13.910
Ladies' lounge next door.

11:13.987 --> 11:17.445
<i>The hen parlor's thataway, my dear.</i>

11:17.524 --> 11:19.492
No wonder your establishment is empty.

11:22.396 --> 11:24.489
Good day.

11:27.401 --> 11:29.665
Oh! Oh!

11:31.004 --> 11:32.904
You can take him!

11:37.244 --> 11:39.405
No!

11:59.566 --> 12:01.534
Oh! No, no!

12:01.602 --> 12:04.696
<i>No, not my bags. Not my-</i>

12:04.771 --> 12:07.763
<i>Oh, no, no!</i>

12:13.847 --> 12:16.407
<i>Here.</i>

12:16.483 --> 12:18.417
Welcome to Australia.

12:22.522 --> 12:24.990
<i>Drover take Mrs. Boss to Faraway Downs...</i>

12:25.058 --> 12:27.356
<i>in a great, big, fancy truck.</i>

12:28.428 --> 12:31.659
<i>He even let her sit in his special seat.</i>

12:31.732 --> 12:35.691
<i>She even drinks</i>
<i>Drover's own water bottle.</i>

12:35.769 --> 12:36.963
<i>That's it.</i>

12:37.037 --> 12:39.665
<i>They get along like a burnin' house.</i>

12:39.740 --> 12:41.731
<i>Now, Magarri-he sit'em up top.</i>

12:41.808 --> 12:44.800
<i>And Magarri's cousin Goolajbaloong-</i>

12:44.878 --> 12:46.846
<i>he come along for the ride.</i>

12:46.913 --> 12:49.381
- Oh!
- <i>They make'em friends right away.</i>

12:49.449 --> 12:51.041
Water.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.312
Oh.

12:52.386 --> 12:55.253
That's it. That's it. Stay, Jedda. Stay.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.490
"Trusted man."
Typical of my husband.

13:02.562 --> 13:04.496
Actually, your husband's
a pretty good bloke.

13:04.564 --> 13:06.862
Yes, well, he certainly knows
how to choose his employees.

13:06.933 --> 13:09.925
- Employee?
- Mmm. No wonder the place is bankrupt.

13:10.003 --> 13:12.028
- Lady, I'm not an employee.
- <i> Really?</i>

13:12.105 --> 13:15.097
So you're just driving me
all the way out to Faraway Downs...

13:15.175 --> 13:17.336
- as a personal favor to my husband, are you?
- No.

13:17.411 --> 13:19.504
Him being
such a good bloke and all, hmm?

13:19.579 --> 13:22.878
I'm driving you out there because he
promised me a drove of 1,500 head of cattle.

13:22.949 --> 13:25.008
- What, to buy?
- No, you goose. To drove.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.282
I'm a drover, right? I move
the cattle from "A" to "B."

13:28.355 --> 13:31.791
<i>All right? I work on commission.</i>
<i>No man hires me, no man fires me.</i>

13:31.858 --> 13:33.257
- Oh-
- Everything I own...

13:33.326 --> 13:36.193
I can fit in my saddlebag,
which is the way I like it.

13:36.263 --> 13:41.064
Oh! Yes, well, it's all-
all very "outback adventure," isn't it?

13:41.134 --> 13:43.364
- I'm not saying it's for everyone.
- No.

13:43.437 --> 13:45.701
Definitely not for everyone.

13:45.772 --> 13:48.707
Most people like to own things.
You know, land, luggage, other people.

13:48.775 --> 13:52.711
<i>Makes them feel secure.</i>
<i>But all that can be taken away.</i>

13:52.779 --> 13:56.215
And in the end, the only thing
you really own is, uh-

13:56.283 --> 13:58.410
is your story.

13:58.485 --> 14:00.476
Just tryin' to live a good one.

14:00.554 --> 14:04.012
Yes, yes. An adventure story.
Mmm. You sound just like my husband.

14:06.359 --> 14:08.953
Oh!

14:09.029 --> 14:11.259
Oh, they're kangaroos!

14:11.331 --> 14:13.561
- <i>Big reds.</i>
- Oh! Lovely.

14:13.633 --> 14:15.999
- <i>Beautiful.</i>
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

14:16.069 --> 14:18.094
<i> I've never seen a kangaroo.</i>
<i>Beautiful, jumping.</i>

14:18.171 --> 14:20.162
- <i> Yeah, they're jumping.</i>
- Oh!

14:20.240 --> 14:22.731
Oh, it's beautiful.

14:22.809 --> 14:26.142
- <i>Uh-</i>
- Oh! Look at them jumping!

14:36.590 --> 14:39.354
Ah!

15:10.390 --> 15:12.984
Mr. Drover.

15:13.059 --> 15:14.651
Hey, Miss Boss.

15:14.728 --> 15:16.161
Tucker, Mrs. Boss?

15:16.229 --> 15:18.527
- Mr. Drover.
- Yeah?

15:18.598 --> 15:20.998
- There's only one tent.
- That's right.

15:21.067 --> 15:21.879
For the four of us?

15:21.880 --> 15:24.230
Well, you know, it gets
pretty chilly here at night.

15:24.304 --> 15:27.671
We, uh-We like to bunk up together,
eh, Magarri? Goolaj, huh?

15:27.741 --> 15:30.039
Nice and close, you know.

15:35.649 --> 15:36.638
Oh!

15:36.716 --> 15:38.707
Oh, come on, Lady Ashley.

15:38.785 --> 15:40.844
We're just having a laugh.

15:40.921 --> 15:44.914
Never really slept in a tent in our life.
We just bunk around the fire, you see?

15:44.991 --> 15:48.017
- See, we're not really used to, um-
- A woman?

15:48.094 --> 15:51.325
<i>I suppose you think I should be</i>
<i>back in Darwin at the church fete...</i>

15:51.398 --> 15:53.559
<i>or the ladies'. uh, whatever you call it.</i>

15:53.633 --> 15:56.227
Well, I will have you know
that I am as capable as any man.

15:59.606 --> 16:02.734
Guests. We're not used to guests.
That's what I was about to say.

16:02.809 --> 16:05.903
But now you mention it, I happen to
quite like the women of the outback.

16:05.979 --> 16:08.709
But they're mostly native women.

16:08.782 --> 16:10.272
Aboriginal women.

16:10.350 --> 16:13.444
<i>They're very easy to, uh-</i>

16:13.520 --> 16:15.954
to get along with, if you try.

16:16.022 --> 16:18.616
<i># Whoa, babe</i>
<i>something is bothering me #</i>

16:18.925 --> 16:21.951
Go!

16:22.028 --> 16:24.189
- <i>Ho!</i>
- Him always punctual.

16:28.001 --> 16:31.232
Get out of here!

16:31.304 --> 16:34.171
- <i> What's that?</i>
- Your accountant.

16:34.241 --> 16:38.143
<i> Hey, Drover!</i>
<i>He's your bloody problem now!</i>

16:38.211 --> 16:40.202
<i>See you, Drover!</i>

16:44.684 --> 16:47.778
Kippelly Flymm.

16:47.854 --> 16:51.255
- Kippelly Flynn.
- I'm sorry. What was your name again?

16:51.324 --> 16:55.488
Lipelling Klymm, mi- mila- milady.

16:55.562 --> 16:57.621
Kipling Flynn.

16:58.665 --> 17:00.656
Thanks.

17:05.839 --> 17:08.672
<i>How long till we reach Faraway Downs?</i>

17:08.742 --> 17:11.676
<i> Oh, we've been on it</i>
<i>for the last two days.</i>

17:15.147 --> 17:17.742
- Drover! Hey, Drover!
- <i>Yeah, love. How you doing?</i>

17:17.817 --> 17:20.217
<i>Good. Aren't you gonna stop</i>
<i>and have a rest for a while?</i>

17:20.287 --> 17:22.755
Nah, gotta make a delivery.
Put the kettle on.

17:22.821 --> 17:25.790
- I'll be round in a couple days. Give us a kiss.
- Okay.

17:25.858 --> 17:28.384
See you soon.

17:28.461 --> 17:30.827
- She's easy to get on with.
- Ah, she's trouble, that one.

17:30.897 --> 17:32.831
- See you later!
- <i>Bye!</i>

17:32.899 --> 17:35.834
You and my husband
share an interest.

17:35.902 --> 17:37.529
An interest? Really?

17:37.604 --> 17:41.335
Come on. We all know the real reason
that my husband is out here.

17:41.408 --> 17:44.343
Oh. Right.
You mean the breeding. Yeah.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.709
- Breeding?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

17:46.780 --> 17:48.873
No, we're both dead keen on breeding.

17:48.949 --> 17:50.883
I have this idea,
which, uh-which he loves.

17:50.951 --> 17:53.545
You might be quite excited
about it too, actually.

17:53.620 --> 17:57.351
Now, I'm a brumby man,
but his fancy English filly, Capricornia...

17:57.424 --> 17:59.153
<i>has really caught my eye.</i>

17:59.225 --> 18:01.785
I got to admit.
She is gorgeous. Really gorgeous.

18:01.861 --> 18:05.126
Gorgeous creature.

18:08.568 --> 18:11.537
<i>I've always wanted to mate an English</i>
<i>thoroughbred with a bush brumby.</i>

18:11.604 --> 18:15.540
<i>I mean, it'd be magic, wouldn't it?</i>
<i>Magic.</i>

18:15.608 --> 18:17.667
- <i>Imagine that combination.</i>
- Don't. Don't you say another word.

18:17.744 --> 18:20.542
- I know what you're implying.
- You've thought about it, too, haven't you?

18:20.613 --> 18:22.740
Capricornia-You- Poppycock!

18:22.816 --> 18:24.579
- What are you talking about?
- Poppycock!

18:35.562 --> 18:37.496
Coppers.

18:37.564 --> 18:41.159
- What are you talking about?
- You-You want-

18:43.303 --> 18:47.239
- You want to have it on with me.
- What? What was that?

18:47.307 --> 18:49.241
Oh, you know exactly what I'm saying.

18:49.309 --> 18:51.436
<i>Just like you have it on with</i>
<i>that poor girl you're exploiting...</i>

18:51.511 --> 18:53.672
and-and-and God knows how many others.

18:53.747 --> 18:55.112
What are you talking about?

18:59.753 --> 19:01.618
- You got a filthy mind, lady.
- You're an animal!

19:01.688 --> 19:04.714
I wouldn't have it on with you
if you were the only tart left in Australia.

19:04.791 --> 19:06.554
- Animal! You are a-
- Believe me, I wouldn't-

19:06.626 --> 19:08.059
<i>You-</i>

19:12.632 --> 19:14.122
<i>Oh!</i>

19:16.269 --> 19:17.600
Oh!

19:17.670 --> 19:18.932
<i>What was that?</i>

19:19.005 --> 19:21.166
- Stay in the car.
- No, no.

19:21.241 --> 19:24.039
Get your hands off me.

19:25.779 --> 19:28.145
For once in your life,
do as you're bloody told.

19:44.697 --> 19:47.598
<i>There she is.</i>

19:48.902 --> 19:51.871
Faraway Downs.

20:02.248 --> 20:05.706
<i>And that first time I saw her-</i>

20:05.785 --> 20:08.515
- <i>that Mrs. Boss.</i>
- Oh! Oh!

20:23.837 --> 20:26.931
Lady Ashley, wait! Don't go in there!

21:02.175 --> 21:04.200
I'm so sorry.

21:24.197 --> 21:26.631
<i>My family has had the honor of serving...</i>

21:26.699 --> 21:30.430
the owners of Faraway Downs
for three generations.

21:30.503 --> 21:33.063
<i>We know how hard this land can be.</i>

21:33.139 --> 21:36.006
<i>But Lord Maitland Ashley-he-</i>

21:36.075 --> 21:38.009
he never gave up.

21:38.077 --> 21:41.740
The only thing that could stop this decent
and courageous man was a spear...

21:41.814 --> 21:45.773
<i>from a murderous black,</i>
<i>the so-called King George.</i>

21:45.852 --> 21:48.719
<i>And he will be brought to justice.</i>

21:48.788 --> 21:52.019
<i>Let us now pray for Maitland Ashley...</i>

21:52.091 --> 21:55.686
<i>that his soul may enter peacefully</i>
<i>through the gates of heaven.</i>

22:04.938 --> 22:08.601
Lady Ashley, we can leave for Darwin
first thing in the morning.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.700
Yes, yes. Certainly, Mr. Fletcher.

22:10.777 --> 22:12.438
Watch the, um-

22:14.380 --> 22:17.679
I can't understand what my husband
would have seen out here.

22:20.086 --> 22:22.748
Yeah, this land has a strange power.

23:02.528 --> 23:06.624
<i>That first night, when the sun go to sleep...</i>

23:06.699 --> 23:11.193
<i>King George tell me</i>
<i>this land be healed.</i>

23:11.271 --> 23:16.265
<i>He tell'em me that woman-</i>
<i>that far, far away woman-</i>

23:16.342 --> 23:19.140
<i>she be like the rain.</i>

23:19.212 --> 23:23.308
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>I'm gonna sing her to me.</i>

23:25.385 --> 23:28.513
<i> Make the land sing.</i>

24:10.129 --> 24:13.895
I let you see me now.

24:13.966 --> 24:16.025
Who are you?

24:16.102 --> 24:18.195
I Nullah.

24:18.271 --> 24:20.171
How did you get in here?

24:20.239 --> 24:23.106
I make myself invisible...

24:23.176 --> 24:25.337
with <i>gulapa</i> magic!

24:33.486 --> 24:36.319
What do you want?

24:36.389 --> 24:39.825
That <i>balanda</i> Fletcher
been curse to this place.

24:41.094 --> 24:44.325
<i>But you like Rainbow Serpent.</i>

24:45.365 --> 24:47.629
You <i>mien-muk.</i>

24:47.700 --> 24:51.693
<i>You heal this land, so I sing you to me.</i>

24:53.206 --> 24:56.039
Like I sing a fish to me.

25:07.186 --> 25:08.983
<i>I sing, too...</i>

25:10.056 --> 25:12.616
when Mama and Fletcher...

25:14.260 --> 25:16.251
make wrong-side business.

25:16.329 --> 25:17.887
Wrong-sided business?

25:17.964 --> 25:20.432
You know.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.434
Laying down and tickling.

25:22.502 --> 25:26.268
- Oh, my goodness.
- Me and you secret.

25:26.339 --> 25:29.672
Oh, my goodness. Mr. Fletcher?

25:29.742 --> 25:32.074
I got to sing to Mama to warn her...

25:32.145 --> 25:34.170
that Lord Boss Ashley is coming down.

25:34.247 --> 25:36.511
Maitland? I- I-

25:36.582 --> 25:39.073
<i>I mean, Lord Ashley?</i>

25:39.152 --> 25:41.586
Yeah. He plenty funny.

25:41.654 --> 25:46.284
So that's why I took him down the billabong,
shown him all the big, fat, cheeky bulls.

25:46.359 --> 25:49.328
Come here. Look'em. Look.

25:49.395 --> 25:51.454
Get pushed across that river...

25:51.531 --> 25:53.465
over to Carney land.

25:53.533 --> 25:55.262
The bulls.

25:55.334 --> 25:57.529
<i>"Billabong"?</i>

25:57.603 --> 25:59.730
<i>That's where Maitland was killed.</i>

25:59.806 --> 26:02.001
<i> But, Mrs. Boss, that spear was-</i>

26:02.074 --> 26:03.939
Please don't.

26:04.010 --> 26:05.807
Don't make'em that policeman
take away my boy.

26:07.246 --> 26:09.043
Them coppers. That bad Fletcher.

26:09.115 --> 26:12.983
He say you see me,
you send me to the Mission Island.

26:13.052 --> 26:16.112
To that lock-lock.
Throw away bloody key.

26:17.390 --> 26:19.358
Please, missus! Quick!

26:19.425 --> 26:21.985
I make us invisible.

27:44.443 --> 27:47.901
- Mrs. Boss.
- Oh! Oh. It's you.

27:47.980 --> 27:50.972
Last night, I show you-

27:51.050 --> 27:52.142
Hyah!

27:52.218 --> 27:54.652
where-

27:56.389 --> 27:58.414
Yeah.
She's a beautiful day, isn't she?

28:00.026 --> 28:01.755
How was your sleep? Restful?

28:01.827 --> 28:03.954
I wouldn't say so, no.

28:04.030 --> 28:06.590
Yeah, now, the boys are-
the boys are just finishing up.

28:06.666 --> 28:10.124
Gotta tell you, they're a pretty sorry mob
of cattle. Seems hardly worth the effort.

28:10.202 --> 28:12.136
Ready to go, Lady Ashley?

28:13.039 --> 28:14.131
Billabong.

28:14.206 --> 28:16.071
Mr. Fletcher...

28:16.142 --> 28:18.940
<i>tell me about the big,</i>
<i>fat cows that cross the river...</i>

28:19.011 --> 28:20.945
down at the "billabalong,"
or whatever you call it.

28:21.013 --> 28:23.675
Near the billabong?
No, that's Carney property over there.

28:23.749 --> 28:25.239
Our cattle don't cross the river.

28:25.318 --> 28:27.650
- Apparently they do.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

28:27.720 --> 28:29.244
Who-Who says they do?

28:30.323 --> 28:32.314
That little boy there.

28:38.698 --> 28:42.361
<i>Oh, you mean the little half-caste fella?</i>

28:42.435 --> 28:44.835
Hey. Hey, little fella. Come here.

28:44.904 --> 28:48.635
<i>Come and tell Mr. Fletcher</i>
<i>what you told me last night.</i>

28:49.609 --> 28:51.600
Yeah, come on, Nullah.

28:52.945 --> 28:55.004
- <i> Yes.</i>
- They're funny ones.

29:03.422 --> 29:05.515
Now...

29:05.591 --> 29:08.719
did you see big, fat cattle
crossing Marmont River?

29:08.794 --> 29:13.288
<i>Or were they just Carney cattle on</i>
<i>the other side of the river having a drink?</i>

29:15.701 --> 29:18.636
<i>Them just Carney cattle, Mr. Fletcher.</i>

29:18.704 --> 29:21.502
- I been lookin' myself.
- Yeah?

29:26.145 --> 29:29.911
Ah, you tell great, big,
tall stories, don't ya, eh?

29:29.982 --> 29:34.078
<i> It's all right, Mr. Fletcher.</i>
<i>I'm sure the boy just made a mistake.</i>

29:34.153 --> 29:36.519
<i> All right.</i>
<i>We best get going, Lady Ashley.</i>

29:36.589 --> 29:40.821
Sing Song. Take the little fella to the kitchen.
Give him a big feed of that tucker he likes.

29:40.893 --> 29:43.862
- Forgive me, Mr. Fletcher.
- Look. I understand.

29:43.929 --> 29:45.692
You barely slept.

29:45.765 --> 29:47.756
- Wait, wait.
- Let me go.

29:49.769 --> 29:52.033
Yeah. Well, that old windmill
hasn't turned in years.

29:52.104 --> 29:54.402
He's a sweet little boy.
I don't think he meant any harm.

29:54.473 --> 29:57.499
Yeah, no, they're funny, little creamies.
They're all a bit soft in the head, yeah.

29:57.576 --> 30:00.602
<i>That's why the, uh, government</i>
<i>sends them to the mission.</i>

30:00.680 --> 30:03.547
<i>They all tell bloody monstrous lies.</i>
<i>Yeah. And the next one, quick.</i>

30:03.616 --> 30:05.550
<i>Come on. We haven't got all day.</i>

30:05.618 --> 30:07.449
<i>I no bloody liar!</i>

30:08.821 --> 30:12.018
<i>He liar! He say this not work!</i>

30:24.704 --> 30:26.433
Fletcher liar!

30:27.473 --> 30:29.703
- <i>No! Leave him alone!</i>
- Nullah!

30:29.775 --> 30:32.243
- Fletcher!
- I curse you!

30:32.311 --> 30:35.144
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

30:35.214 --> 30:38.650
- Please!
- Run! Run! Run, Nullah! Run!

30:38.718 --> 30:40.948
I curse you!

30:41.020 --> 30:43.284
Leave him alone!

30:43.355 --> 30:46.256
<i>Mr. Fletcher!</i>

30:46.325 --> 30:49.123
- Leave him alone!
- Mr. Fletcher!

30:53.199 --> 30:55.292
<i> Get off my property.</i>

30:55.367 --> 30:57.267
You no longer work for me.

30:57.336 --> 31:00.737
<i> If I go, my men go with me.</i>

31:00.806 --> 31:04.765
There won't be a single bloody beast in the
stockyard to start the drove in the morning.

31:04.844 --> 31:07.904
<i>You heard what I said.</i>
<i>Get off my property!</i>

31:07.980 --> 31:09.914
- Yeah?
- <i>Go!</i>

31:09.982 --> 31:12.507
Now!

31:15.554 --> 31:17.749
You're the boss.

31:18.924 --> 31:20.858
<i>Flynn, get in the car.</i>

31:20.926 --> 31:22.860
I'll give you a new job somewhere else.

31:22.928 --> 31:24.987
Bunchemup, grab the gear.
Pack it up.

31:25.064 --> 31:27.362
<i>I'll see you in Desperation Creek</i>
<i>in a few days.</i>

31:32.438 --> 31:35.066
Bloody old fool.

31:44.083 --> 31:46.813
Carney's gonna get this property.

31:46.886 --> 31:49.878
Been a pleasure working for ya.
Real pleasure.

31:49.955 --> 31:51.684
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:17.416 --> 32:21.716
<i> That strange woman-</i>
<i>she fire'em that Fletcher.</i>

32:27.126 --> 32:29.321
<i>He can't hurt Mama no more.</i>

32:34.266 --> 32:39.602
<i>From that day on,</i>
<i>we call her... Mrs. Boss.</i>

32:44.109 --> 32:47.169
Why would Fletcher block the water pump?

32:47.246 --> 32:49.646
I don't know. All crazy.

32:49.715 --> 32:52.616
- White fella, blackfella- all crazy.
- Crazy.

33:03.629 --> 33:06.063
<i> Mr. Flynn.</i>

33:07.433 --> 33:10.266
- Milady.
- Don't get up.

33:11.704 --> 33:14.104
The truth, Mr. Flynn.

33:18.310 --> 33:21.473
This, uh, ledger...

33:21.547 --> 33:26.610
which, um, Fletcher had me keep
for the benefit of your husband...

33:26.685 --> 33:29.711
is a tale of decline and ruin...

33:29.788 --> 33:33.383
redolent of the great Gibbon.

33:33.459 --> 33:35.893
There is, however, another...

33:35.961 --> 33:38.259
kept for the benefit...

33:38.330 --> 33:41.128
of Mr. Carney...

33:41.200 --> 33:45.660
<i>in which is recorded</i>
<i>all the unbranded...</i>

33:45.738 --> 33:47.729
fat cattle...

33:47.806 --> 33:52.106
- siphoned off across the river and into his herd.
- <i>## </i>

33:52.177 --> 33:54.407
And the boy.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.972
<i>He's Fletcher's son, isn't he?</i>

33:58.050 --> 34:02.282
As with all things Fletcher,
it's impossible to prove anything.

34:02.354 --> 34:04.948
Still, if Carney's good Christian wife...

34:05.024 --> 34:07.993
ever comes to the same conclusion
as yourself...

34:08.060 --> 34:12.860
Fletcher's chances of marrying
their daughter would be dashed.

34:12.931 --> 34:15.799
I'm going to the authorities,
and I will be telling them-

34:15.868 --> 34:18.530
- Carney <i>is</i> the authority here.
- Are you suggesting...

34:18.603 --> 34:22.665
I let him steal my cattle and buy my property
for a fraction of what it's worth?

34:22.741 --> 34:27.768
<i>I'm suggesting that you continue</i>
<i>to do what your husband set out to do.</i>

34:29.514 --> 34:30.880
Drove.

34:32.051 --> 34:34.952
Drove the cattle to Darwin.

34:35.020 --> 34:38.786
Would you mind?

34:38.857 --> 34:41.018
I need a drink.

34:41.092 --> 34:43.926
My lady, drove.

34:43.996 --> 34:47.056
Drove the cattle to Darwin,
sell them to the army...

34:47.132 --> 34:49.032
and you'll break Carney's monopoly.

34:49.101 --> 34:51.899
Use the profits to put Faraway Downs
back on its feet.

34:51.971 --> 34:54.030
You go back to London.

34:54.106 --> 34:56.199
You're sitting pretty
for the rest of your life.

34:56.275 --> 34:58.243
That's what Maitland
said he was doing.

34:58.310 --> 35:02.076
And there's no reason
why you can't do the same.

35:11.123 --> 35:13.091
<i>There is just one small problem.</i>

35:14.593 --> 35:18.188
Having dismissed Fletcher,
there's no one to muster the cattle.

35:28.841 --> 35:30.775
Hyah! Hyah!

35:33.112 --> 35:35.512
<i>Flynn! Mrs. Boss!</i>

35:35.581 --> 35:37.776
<i>It's the Drover!</i>

35:50.696 --> 35:53.563
Drover! Drover!

35:53.632 --> 35:55.623
Hyah!

36:04.510 --> 36:06.603
Hyah!

36:08.147 --> 36:10.911
Yeah, Drover! Yeah!

36:10.983 --> 36:12.974
Teach me how to
break them brumbies!

36:14.653 --> 36:16.644
- See any boys in there?
- <i>No.</i>

36:16.722 --> 36:18.815
Goolaj, go see if they're
out in the top paddock.

36:18.891 --> 36:21.758
- Mr. Drover!
- <i>Just get the bloody brumbies in there.</i>

36:21.827 --> 36:24.387
- I'll find out what the hell's going on.
- Teach me to break them horses.

36:24.463 --> 36:26.590
- Fill the water trough, son.
- I need to speak to you!

36:26.665 --> 36:29.259
<i>Where the hell are</i>
<i>all the bloody stockmen, eh?</i>

36:29.334 --> 36:32.326
- That's what I need to speak to you about.
- Where's Fletcher?

36:32.404 --> 36:36.067
- We disagreed, and I dismissed him.
- Dismissed?

36:36.141 --> 36:38.803
- Yes.
- Wa- Hang on. What about the cattle?

36:38.877 --> 36:40.868
Well, it beggars belief,
but as he was leaving...

36:40.946 --> 36:44.575
he deliberately let the cows out of
the, uh- I don't know-whatever you call it...

36:44.650 --> 36:45.776
and they ran off!

36:45.851 --> 36:48.843
Damn! Do you realize, woman,
what you've done?

36:48.921 --> 36:51.481
Mr. Drover, do not take that tone with me.
Thank you very much!

36:51.557 --> 36:53.491
- Don't take that tone with you, huh?
- No.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.527
I'm asking you, woman,
do you know what you've done?

36:55.594 --> 36:58.825
I won't get another drove this late in the season.
You've cost me my living.

36:58.897 --> 37:02.162
- Can't you just round them up?
- Round them up, huh? Oh, round them up. Yeah!

37:02.234 --> 37:05.294
- Yes. You just go get them.
- 1,500 head of cattle-

37:05.370 --> 37:05.521
Oh!

37:05.522 --> 37:08.635
Scattered over a million acres
with just me and my two men.

37:08.707 --> 37:10.766
That's a great idea. Stupid cow.

37:10.843 --> 37:13.334
Mr. Drover,
I was right to dismiss Mr. Fletcher...

37:13.412 --> 37:14.777
on moral grounds.

37:14.847 --> 37:16.178
Moral grounds?

37:16.248 --> 37:19.411
<i>You're at that again, are ya?</i>
<i>Let me guess.</i>

37:19.485 --> 37:21.646
He wanted to, uh, exploit you, did he?

37:21.720 --> 37:23.449
- Fancy you, did he?
- What?

37:23.522 --> 37:24.095
Stop it. I -

37:24.096 --> 37:26.719
Is there any man in this
world who doesn't fancy you?

37:26.792 --> 37:28.555
- Please.
- Huh?

37:28.627 --> 37:31.528
Mr. Fletcher is working for Mr. Carney.

37:31.597 --> 37:34.725
<i>They were pushing the best</i>
<i>of the unbranded cattle...</i>

37:34.800 --> 37:39.703
across the river
onto Mr. Carney's property.

37:39.771 --> 37:42.331
They were stealing!

37:44.610 --> 37:48.011
- There's no surprises there.
- No, he's a bad man.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.913
All right, all right.
But look. You can't prove it, right?

37:50.983 --> 37:53.042
- Well-
- <i>You can't.</i>

37:53.118 --> 37:57.384
And you can't win against Carney.
So just take my advice, lady.

37:57.456 --> 38:01.688
Grab King Carney's offer and go the hell
back to England as quickly as possible.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.661
That way you'd make everybody happy,
especially me.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.602
So you're just going to walk away?

38:10.669 --> 38:12.762
I learned a long time ago
not to fight other people's wars.

38:12.838 --> 38:15.398
Wait! Wait! Wait! Mr. Drover, wait!

38:15.474 --> 38:18.375
Please, please, please!
Mr. Drover, please! Please! Wait!

38:18.443 --> 38:21.003
Please. I-

38:21.079 --> 38:24.674
Listen. You said that your dream was
to breed a thoroughbred with a-

38:24.750 --> 38:26.012
with a bush brumby.

38:26.084 --> 38:28.450
<i>If you agree to help me, I-</i>

38:29.788 --> 38:31.949
I will give you my Capricornia.

38:43.135 --> 38:46.627
And how we gonna do a drove
with just me and my two men, huh?

38:50.776 --> 38:52.767
Oh, crikey.

38:52.844 --> 38:55.108
<i>Mum was a drover's boy for Fletcher.</i>

38:55.180 --> 38:57.876
<i>Bandy was a drover's boy</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

38:57.950 --> 39:01.317
<i>Some white stockmen like to have</i>
<i>an Aboriginal woman on the drove...</i>

39:01.386 --> 39:03.320
to keep 'em company at night.

39:03.388 --> 39:05.948
<i>They shave their heads,</i>
<i>make 'em look like boys...</i>

39:06.024 --> 39:08.652
<i>and work 'em like any other stockman</i>
<i>during the day.</i>

39:08.727 --> 39:10.661
That's, uh-What do you call it?

39:10.729 --> 39:13.562
- Exploiting them.
- Exploiting, yes.

39:15.567 --> 39:17.501
Anyway, we're still in trouble.

39:17.569 --> 39:21.505
We gotta have seven good riders at least,
and the most I can count is five.

39:21.573 --> 39:23.632
- What have we got? We've got me-
- You.

39:23.709 --> 39:25.973
- Magarri.
- Yeah, Magarri!

39:26.044 --> 39:27.477
- Goolaj-
- Great.

39:27.546 --> 39:30.344
We got Daisy. Nice ride.
And, uh, Bandy. Good work.

39:30.415 --> 39:33.111
<i>Oh. What about Mr. Sing Song?</i>
<i>Mr. Sing Song, ride horse?</i>

39:33.185 --> 39:35.847
- Hey. Don't look at me.
- Sing Song, me real good cooker.

39:35.921 --> 39:38.151
Cook's wagon at best.
We got five, right? It's not enough.

39:38.223 --> 39:40.157
We need two more experienced riders.

39:40.225 --> 39:43.319
I did that run once back in 1935...

39:43.395 --> 39:45.413
with Magarri, Dingo Jones
and the Drongo brothers-

39:45.414 --> 39:46.125
Drongo brothers.

39:46.198 --> 39:49.634
- true knights of the outback.
- Mr. Flynn. Can you ride?

39:49.701 --> 39:51.532
- I can.
- I won't carry a drunk.

39:51.603 --> 39:52.797
But don't.

39:52.871 --> 39:54.805
<i>I ride'em real bloody good!</i>

39:54.873 --> 39:58.365
I drove those no-good cheeky bulls
into the big, bloody metal ship.

39:58.443 --> 40:02.004
- All right. Five and a quarter.
- Six and a quarter.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.775
<i>What?</i>

40:03.849 --> 40:06.374
Lady, this ain't trotting
in Kensington Gardens.

40:06.451 --> 40:11.013
<i> Mr. Drover, I could show you</i>
<i>a thing or two about horses.</i>

40:11.089 --> 40:14.525
Pretty sure, when it comes to horses,
there's nothing you can show me.

40:14.593 --> 40:17.960
- Bring the horse.
- You can't be serious.

40:18.030 --> 40:20.123
Bring the horse.

40:20.198 --> 40:22.189
Oh, this should be interesting.

40:23.902 --> 40:27.394
<i>Move along! Move along!</i>
<i>Rah! Rah!</i>

40:27.472 --> 40:29.030
Move along!

40:29.107 --> 40:30.904
Rah! Rah!

40:30.976 --> 40:33.206
- What are you doing?
- <i>Shoo! Shoo!</i>

40:33.278 --> 40:36.338
Rah, rah! Rah. Rah! Move it!

40:36.415 --> 40:39.179
- Lady Ashley-
- Move it! Move it! They're going the wrong way.

40:39.251 --> 40:41.185
Rah! Rah!

40:41.253 --> 40:43.744
<i>Rah! Rah!</i>

40:43.822 --> 40:47.417
Oh! It's easy.
Stubborn things. Silly cows.

40:47.492 --> 40:50.325
- Hey, hey, hey. What the bloody hell you doing?
- Come on.

40:50.395 --> 40:53.558
You're scattering them all over the place.
Get up the back there, up the tail.

40:55.901 --> 40:59.564
Get up there. Go, go, go, go, go!
Don't let 'em break away.

40:59.638 --> 41:02.004
Go on.

41:05.410 --> 41:09.244
Run, you cows! Move, you cows!

41:10.816 --> 41:13.011
We're trying to get the cows up there.

41:14.453 --> 41:17.752
- Not too bad, Lady Ashley.
- I've got him! I've got him!

41:19.124 --> 41:21.092
I think we're doing pretty well.

41:23.228 --> 41:26.197
You crazy- take all this stuff.

41:26.264 --> 41:28.255
Where you think you going?
Shanghai?

41:28.333 --> 41:30.460
A lady never knows
what she might need.

41:49.821 --> 41:52.949
Run, Nullah! Run! Run!

41:53.024 --> 41:56.289
- Coppers! Coppers!
- <i>Tank! Run! Tank.</i>

41:56.361 --> 41:58.886
Tank, Nullah! Tank!

42:00.232 --> 42:02.530
<i>Bandy, coppers!</i>

42:02.601 --> 42:05.297
Hurry up!

42:23.722 --> 42:24.366
Turn 'em loose.

42:24.367 --> 42:27.283
<i> Go on. Get out.</i>
<i>You two, check the east side.</i>

42:27.359 --> 42:30.157
<i>Move, move! Hurry up!</i>

42:41.440 --> 42:43.499
<i>Daisy's in the tank.</i>

42:44.576 --> 42:47.670
Shh!

42:49.247 --> 42:51.181
Bandy, tea. Tea.

42:53.919 --> 42:56.911
<i> Where's the creamy?</i>

43:00.892 --> 43:02.826
<i>Trackers.</i>

43:14.306 --> 43:15.637
<i>Nullah.</i>

43:23.381 --> 43:28.011
Lady Ashley, Sergeant Callahan
of the Northern Territory Police.

43:36.928 --> 43:38.759
Grab the float.

43:42.934 --> 43:46.028
I can't begin to tell you,
Lady Ashley, how the...

43:46.104 --> 43:49.267
tragedy which befell
your late husband has...

43:49.341 --> 43:53.971
wrung sympathy from the hearts of every civilized
man and woman in the Northern Territory.

44:01.586 --> 44:03.918
Let me assure you, Lady Ashley...

44:03.989 --> 44:06.753
that the suspect, King George,
will be brought to justice.

44:06.825 --> 44:11.319
But surely a witch doctor could conceal
his own tracks, Sergeant, could he not?

44:11.396 --> 44:14.388
Makes no difference.
It's only a matter of time.

44:40.625 --> 44:42.490
Shh!

44:52.304 --> 44:56.434
Oh, incidentally, I met up with
your former manager, Neil Fletcher.

44:56.508 --> 45:00.467
He informed me that there's a half-blood
Aboriginal child out here somewhere.

45:00.545 --> 45:04.675
I thought we might pick him up
and put him in the good hands of the church.

45:06.418 --> 45:08.818
I will be sure to look out for him.

45:11.756 --> 45:13.747
Till we meet again, Lady Ashley.

45:15.894 --> 45:18.658
<i>Get 'em in the back, Constable. Let's go.</i>

45:33.912 --> 45:35.470
<i>They're in the tank!</i>

45:35.547 --> 45:36.707
<i>Drover!</i>

45:36.781 --> 45:40.547
<i>Drover, help them! Quickly!</i>

45:43.855 --> 45:46.517
Mama!

45:46.591 --> 45:48.684
Easy. That's it. I got you. I got you.

45:59.904 --> 46:02.498
Come on, Daisy. Come on.

46:24.929 --> 46:27.898
<i>Daisy! Daisy!</i>

46:27.966 --> 46:30.093
Daisy! Daisy!

46:33.672 --> 46:37.005
<i>Daisy! Daisy.</i>

46:37.075 --> 46:40.067
<i>Daisy!</i>

47:25.623 --> 47:27.648
Daisy.

47:49.280 --> 47:52.443
When someone dies
in the Aboriginal culture...

47:52.517 --> 47:55.281
you're not supposed to
say their name again.

47:58.223 --> 48:00.453
He needs motherin'.

48:00.525 --> 48:02.686
Mothering?

48:02.761 --> 48:04.752
<i>Yep.</i>

48:04.829 --> 48:09.323
<i>You're a woman,</i>
<i>so, go on, get down there.</i>

48:09.400 --> 48:14.133
I'm, uh- I'm not, uh, uh-

48:14.205 --> 48:16.503
What?

48:18.610 --> 48:20.601
Good with children.

48:20.678 --> 48:23.806
Oh. Huh.

48:43.268 --> 48:45.259
<i>Nullah.</i>

48:46.905 --> 48:50.238
I wanted to extend my condolences.

48:50.308 --> 48:52.572
Go away.

49:16.034 --> 49:19.697
Would you, uh-
Would you like to hear a story?

49:19.771 --> 49:22.501
What story?

49:24.542 --> 49:29.070
Uh, well, it's, uh- it's called-

49:36.554 --> 49:39.216
- It's called <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>
- What's a wizard?

49:39.290 --> 49:42.259
Well, a wizard is a sort of...

49:42.327 --> 49:43.726
magic man.

49:44.896 --> 49:47.023
<i>Gulapa.</i>

49:51.169 --> 49:53.137
<i>Mama say I gulapa.</i>

49:55.039 --> 49:57.371
- I magic man.
- Really?

49:57.442 --> 49:59.706
I wizard man.

50:03.681 --> 50:06.548
We can't say
Mama's name no more.

50:10.788 --> 50:12.779
No. Well-

50:12.857 --> 50:15.951
Uh, anyway, there's a girl...

50:16.027 --> 50:18.552
and there's a dog.

50:18.630 --> 50:22.430
Ruff. Ruff, ruff, ruff!
And there's a tornado-

50:22.500 --> 50:25.765
- Well, no. It's a- In the film, it's a twister.
- Who twister?

50:25.837 --> 50:29.398
Oh, no, no. Twister's not a person.
It's like a big-Whoosh!

50:29.474 --> 50:31.567
- Like a storm.
- Like the wet?

50:31.643 --> 50:34.077
Like the wet.

50:34.145 --> 50:38.445
Anyway,
the story takes place in a, um-

50:38.516 --> 50:41.246
well, a faraway land...

50:41.319 --> 50:43.310
called Oz.

50:44.856 --> 50:46.847
- This good story.
- Oh, well-

50:46.925 --> 50:50.827
- Got song?
- Yes, yes. Lots of songs.

50:50.895 --> 50:52.362
I like song.

50:53.932 --> 50:55.923
You sing'em me,
I learn'em song.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.491
No, no, no. No.

50:59.871 --> 51:02.032
No.

51:04.108 --> 51:07.236
Well, I- Uh, some.

51:07.312 --> 51:09.644
- I'll sing a little.
- Good.

51:09.714 --> 51:14.515
# Somewhere over the, uh-
the rainbow #

51:14.585 --> 51:16.678
- Rainbow Serpent?
- Yes.

51:16.754 --> 51:19.587
That bloody good. Keep going.
You funny singer, but good song.

51:19.657 --> 51:23.024
Oh.
# Somewhere #

51:26.531 --> 51:30.160
#There's some birds and they-#

51:30.234 --> 51:32.293
- Uh- Oh-
- Keep going. Come on.

51:32.370 --> 51:37.398
# Someday I'll wish upon a- a star #

51:37.475 --> 51:39.409
#And #

51:40.912 --> 51:43.506
- Come on. Sing more.
- Uh-Yes.

51:43.581 --> 51:47.711
#Wake up where the clouds
are far behind #

51:47.785 --> 51:51.721
# Dreams really do come #

51:51.789 --> 51:55.418
#True ##

51:57.495 --> 51:59.486
Oh!

52:01.265 --> 52:03.256
Dreaming song.

52:04.769 --> 52:06.703
<i>Mrs. Boss...</i>

52:06.771 --> 52:10.070
we gotta get those no-good, cheeky bulls
into the big, bloody metal ship.

52:11.109 --> 52:12.940
That's right.

52:13.011 --> 52:15.377
That's what dreaming songs
tell us, Mrs. Boss.

52:16.748 --> 52:19.114
We've got to get those
no-good, big, bloody bulls...

52:19.183 --> 52:21.117
into that metal ship.

52:27.358 --> 52:31.317
I'm sorry. I thought he could-
I thought he could do it.

52:31.396 --> 52:34.854
Yeah, well, people don't change,
Miss Ashley.

52:44.809 --> 52:47.277
Twister. Twister!

52:49.680 --> 52:55.619
- No desert comes drier than Kipling Flynn, milady!
- Well done!

52:55.686 --> 52:58.246
<i>Well done, Kipling!</i>

52:58.322 --> 53:00.085
Hey!

53:00.158 --> 53:02.888
Flynn Kipling! Yea!

53:02.960 --> 53:05.827
Hey, hey!

53:05.897 --> 53:08.923
- Welcome! Welcome!
- <i>Hey, Nullah!</i>

53:09.000 --> 53:11.161
All right.

53:11.235 --> 53:14.432
<i>Well, Mr. Drover, I believe</i>
<i>we have the appropriate number.</i>

53:14.505 --> 53:17.099
- The appropriate number, huh?
- Yes.

53:17.175 --> 53:20.008
Well, listen up.
I'm only gonna say this once.

53:20.078 --> 53:23.570
I run the show.
Everybody does exactly...

53:23.648 --> 53:25.582
as she's told.

53:26.717 --> 53:29.413
- Understood?
- Understood.

53:32.390 --> 53:34.919
No matter your experience
or your age, you pull your weight.

53:34.920 --> 53:35.416
Yes, boss.

53:35.493 --> 53:38.587
And above all,
the Drover's law: no grog.

53:38.663 --> 53:41.461
Now...

53:41.532 --> 53:44.262
if there's a rush and the cattle
are stampeding towards you...

53:44.335 --> 53:47.202
it's not much good prancing
and dancing about on your show pony.

53:47.271 --> 53:50.263
There's only one thing cattle fear
more than a man on a horse...

53:50.341 --> 53:53.242
and that's a man standing
on his own two feet...

53:53.311 --> 53:55.802
staring 'em right between the eyes.

53:57.248 --> 54:00.149
Now, you sure you mob
are still up for it?

54:00.218 --> 54:01.310
Mm-hmm.

54:04.622 --> 54:06.783
You can count on us.

54:06.858 --> 54:08.849
Oh, crikey.

54:10.228 --> 54:13.493
Well, we're what we are.

54:13.564 --> 54:15.930
Gotta get to Darwin
before the ship sails.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.991
Let's get cracking.

54:18.069 --> 54:19.969
The rest of you jokers follow me.

54:20.037 --> 54:22.028
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

54:22.106 --> 54:25.098
I'll get the gate.
Stay back. Don't let 'em scatter.

54:30.114 --> 54:32.514
There, mate. Push 'em over.
Don't let 'em go down there.

54:34.218 --> 54:37.381
- That's it.
- Get 'em up!

54:37.455 --> 54:40.754
- Whoo!
- <i>Hyah!</i>

54:40.825 --> 54:42.952
Get up there!

54:54.705 --> 54:57.538
<i>So we start cracking them whips...</i>

54:57.608 --> 55:01.738
<i>and driving them cheeky bulls</i>
<i>all the way across the land...</i>

55:02.747 --> 55:05.773
<i>to that place they call'em Darwin.</i>

55:09.253 --> 55:12.552
All right.
We'll push 'em straight across here.

55:12.623 --> 55:14.022
Ho!

55:16.427 --> 55:19.885
Very good. Keep 'em movin'.
Nice and steady.

55:22.166 --> 55:24.066
<i> Go on!</i>

55:24.135 --> 55:25.261
- <i>Go on!</i>
- Hyah!

55:25.336 --> 55:26.769
<i>Keep 'em moving.</i>

55:29.941 --> 55:31.602
Giddyup! Giddap!

55:36.214 --> 55:39.650
<i> While the war rages on</i>
<i>in Europe, the Japanese are on the march.</i>

55:39.717 --> 55:42.277
<i>There are reports of an alliance</i>
<i>between the warmongers...</i>

55:42.353 --> 55:45.186
of Germany, Italy and Japan...

55:45.256 --> 55:49.249
which threatens to expand World War II
to the shores of Australia.

55:49.327 --> 55:52.125
<i>This is a war of the air,</i>
<i>but on the ground...</i>

55:52.196 --> 55:55.632
<i>the War Office will announce</i>
<i>who has won the army's contract...</i>

55:55.700 --> 55:58.430
<i>to supply good Aussie beef to the troops.</i>

55:58.502 --> 56:00.800
Couple of days
won't make any difference, Captain.

56:00.871 --> 56:02.805
Might as well sign
the contract now, eh?

56:02.873 --> 56:05.706
I wouldn't be too sure of that,
Mr. Carney.

56:05.776 --> 56:10.804
Air force chaps just spotted a big mob of cattle,
1,500 head, crossing the Marmont River.

56:10.881 --> 56:14.578
Marmont River?
That's Faraway Downs.

56:14.652 --> 56:18.713
Are you, uh, running cattle
out of Faraway Downs, Mr. Fletcher?

56:18.789 --> 56:20.814
Uh, no, no.
I don't work there anymore.

56:20.891 --> 56:24.258
Well, I suppose Lady Ashley's droving
the cattle herself.

56:24.328 --> 56:27.627
Someone must be helping her.

56:28.966 --> 56:31.594
That's right, Neil.
Someone must be helping her.

56:44.415 --> 56:47.612
<i>When Mrs. Boss first come to this land...</i>

56:47.685 --> 56:49.619
<i>she look but she not see.</i>

56:55.393 --> 56:59.489
<i>Now she got her eyes open</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

57:11.442 --> 57:14.343
<i>Some places got spirits.</i>

57:14.412 --> 57:16.380
<i>White fellas don't know.</i>

57:17.415 --> 57:19.713
<i>Some places no good to go.</i>

57:33.197 --> 57:36.098
You gonna sing'em
them cattle tonight?

57:36.167 --> 57:40.604
No, Nullah. Not me.
I'm the orchestra.

57:40.671 --> 57:43.435
That's why I always carry this-

57:43.507 --> 57:47.568
the famous J. Albert & Son
boomerang harmonica.

57:47.645 --> 57:49.579
Can you play that rainbow song?

57:51.082 --> 57:56.145
Well, I've got the latest 100 songs
of the hit parade here.

58:06.697 --> 58:08.858
<i>I like that rainbow song.</i>

58:08.933 --> 58:12.391
<i>It's all about the dreaming.</i>

58:12.470 --> 58:14.461
<i>Gulapa</i> not teach me that yet.

58:14.538 --> 58:16.301
Who's <i>gulapa?</i>

58:16.374 --> 58:19.901
He's my grandfather, King George.

58:21.278 --> 58:25.305
King George... is your grandfather?

58:25.383 --> 58:27.544
<i>He teach me sing a fish song.</i>

58:27.618 --> 58:29.552
<i>He teach me sing down fear.</i>

58:29.620 --> 58:34.250
<i>Fear, evil spirit, wild beast.</i>

58:34.325 --> 58:36.623
Gulapa <i>teach me plenty songs.</i>

58:36.694 --> 58:39.754
<i>Gulapa</i> teach me
that day down the billabong.

58:48.773 --> 58:51.674
Mr. Drover, what is that chanting?

58:51.742 --> 58:54.609
<i>Goolaj and Magarri singing the cattle.</i>

58:54.678 --> 58:56.612
Just keeps them calm at night.

58:56.680 --> 59:01.083
<i>We do it in shifts. Those boys will</i>
<i>finish up in a couple hours. So, Bandy-</i>

59:01.152 --> 59:02.676
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- You show Mrs. Boss...

59:02.753 --> 59:04.846
- <i>how it's done, all right?</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

59:04.922 --> 59:07.891
Sing Song, you and me are gonna
serenade 'em till 3:00, and, uh...

59:07.958 --> 59:11.826
the safest shift is predawn, so that's
the boy soprano and his orchestra.

59:11.896 --> 59:14.421
- All right? You're on till the sun comes up.
- Yes, boss.

59:14.498 --> 59:16.489
All right.
Everybody get some shut-eye.

59:16.567 --> 59:18.967
Uh, Mr. Drover...

59:19.036 --> 59:22.836
I really don't think it's appropriate
to work a child of Nullah's age like that.

59:22.907 --> 59:25.467
<i>Now, I am more than willing</i>
<i>to take his shift.</i>

59:25.543 --> 59:28.273
- But, Mrs. Boss, I plenty old enough.
- <i>No.</i>

59:28.345 --> 59:31.280
- I'm talking now, hmm? Manners.
- <i> Oi, oi, oi. Steady on.</i>

59:31.348 --> 59:34.283
<i>I'm</i> talking.
Look. Just relax, will ya?

59:34.351 --> 59:36.285
The boy's gotta pull his weight
like everyone else.

59:36.353 --> 59:38.514
When I was his age,
I was manning outstations.

59:38.589 --> 59:41.149
- Not everybody's you, Mr. Drover.
- That's right.

59:41.225 --> 59:44.217
Not everyone's me. I'm the boss.

59:46.130 --> 59:48.223
You're on the 3:00 shift. All right?

59:48.299 --> 59:49.994
Yes, boss.

59:50.067 --> 59:52.535
- <i>Night, boss.</i>
- 3:00 a. m?

59:52.603 --> 59:55.367
- Relax, lady. He'll be fine. Good night.
- Night, Mrs. Boss.

59:55.439 --> 59:58.203
Oh. Good night.

59:58.275 --> 01:00:00.300
Good night, Sing Song.

01:00:00.377 --> 01:00:02.650
<i>You're on the 12:00 shift.</i>
<i>I suggest you get some sleep.</i>

01:00:02.651 --> 01:00:03.642
<i> Night, Bandy.</i>

01:00:03.714 --> 01:00:05.682
- <i>Night, Nullah.</i>
- <i> Good night, Flynn.</i>

01:00:05.749 --> 01:00:08.240
Night, Nullah.

01:00:08.552 --> 01:00:10.383
<i>Night-night, Jedda.</i>

01:00:28.572 --> 01:00:32.508
Lord Ashley was killed
by a glass-tipped spear.

01:00:32.576 --> 01:00:34.441
Are you sure?

01:00:34.512 --> 01:00:36.377
You and me secret.

01:01:15.152 --> 01:01:17.086
Rush! Rush!

01:01:21.859 --> 01:01:24.623
<i>They're heading towards the cliff face!</i>

01:01:24.695 --> 01:01:26.424
<i>A stampede! Where's Nullah?</i>

01:01:26.497 --> 01:01:30.160
Get on your horse
and stay with Goolaj.

01:01:30.234 --> 01:01:34.261
<i>Come on. Split up and circle the herd</i>
<i>before they go over the edge!</i>

01:01:34.338 --> 01:01:36.670
Sing Song, pack the camp.
Get the hell out of there!

01:01:44.915 --> 01:01:47.315
<i>Head them off!</i>

01:01:51.722 --> 01:01:53.349
Don't let them split!

01:01:56.026 --> 01:01:58.517
Get in the front!

01:02:05.603 --> 01:02:07.969
Hyah! Hyah!

01:02:08.038 --> 01:02:11.997
<i> Good boy! Come on!</i>
<i>Pull them round! Pull them round!</i>

01:02:15.446 --> 01:02:18.813
Nullah!
You're too close to the edge!

01:02:18.882 --> 01:02:21.851
<i>Courage, my boy! Courage!</i>

01:02:21.919 --> 01:02:24.854
Well done, my boy!

01:02:34.231 --> 01:02:37.723
<i>Nullah!</i>
<i>We have to turn the herd!</i>

01:02:47.077 --> 01:02:49.238
Hyah!

01:02:49.313 --> 01:02:51.247
Hey, hey!

01:02:51.315 --> 01:02:54.182
Never fear, Flynn is here!

01:02:54.251 --> 01:02:57.880
- Yeah, Flynn!
- Hyah!

01:03:14.438 --> 01:03:15.666
Flynn!

01:03:29.153 --> 01:03:30.711
Flynn!

01:03:35.659 --> 01:03:37.593
Nullah, run!

01:04:15.866 --> 01:04:17.629
Nullah!

01:04:51.668 --> 01:04:54.364
<i>Nullah!</i>

01:04:54.438 --> 01:04:56.463
<i>Nullah!</i>

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:59.771
Oh! Oh.

01:05:02.679 --> 01:05:04.840
Oh.

01:05:04.915 --> 01:05:07.315
It's all right. You're safe.

01:05:08.919 --> 01:05:10.853
I've got you.

01:05:10.921 --> 01:05:13.515
You're safe.

01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:15.581
You're safe with me.

01:05:22.699 --> 01:05:24.690
I'll stay with you.

01:05:37.714 --> 01:05:40.012
Hey.

01:05:40.083 --> 01:05:42.779
How's the little fella?

01:05:42.853 --> 01:05:45.686
- Oh, he's fine. He's fine.
- Yeah.

01:05:47.191 --> 01:05:52.686
I have a feeling I might not be able
to complete the next lesson.

01:05:58.035 --> 01:06:01.061
Right, old mate.
I'm gonna get you some water, huh?

01:06:01.138 --> 01:06:06.371
Water's the last thing I want
at this moment in my life.

01:06:06.443 --> 01:06:11.005
Under the wagon-
a bottle of Poor Fella.

01:06:11.081 --> 01:06:14.847
I'm sorry, Drover. Just in case.

01:06:14.918 --> 01:06:18.684
Of course, mate. Of course.

01:06:18.755 --> 01:06:21.849
If you'd all share a drop.

01:06:23.126 --> 01:06:25.924
It would be a terrible shame
to waste it.

01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:35.203
The spear- Nullah told me.

01:06:37.307 --> 01:06:40.868
A glass-tipped spear.

01:06:40.944 --> 01:06:43.572
Tell milady I'm sorry.

01:06:45.415 --> 01:06:47.883
I was a coward.

01:07:31.762 --> 01:07:35.960
We lost just about everything,
except for a few swags and tins of beef.

01:07:36.033 --> 01:07:37.967
And this.

01:07:41.305 --> 01:07:45.002
I can't believe I was so insistent
upon bringing these...

01:07:45.075 --> 01:07:47.009
silly things.

01:07:48.745 --> 01:07:51.509
It was Fletcher who did this,
wasn't it?

01:07:53.483 --> 01:07:56.646
The last thing Flynn told me
before he died was that-

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.621
<i>that your husband was killed by a-</i>

01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:01.851
by a glass-tipped spear...

01:08:01.925 --> 01:08:04.723
like the ornamental ones
in the homestead.

01:08:04.795 --> 01:08:08.231
<i>Glass-tipped is a Kimberley spear.</i>

01:08:08.298 --> 01:08:09.993
King George is from Arnhem.

01:08:10.067 --> 01:08:13.366
<i>Fletcher was trying to make it</i>
<i>look like King George.</i>

01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:17.167
- Fletcher.
- It can't be proved.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.174
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:08:21.877 --> 01:08:24.243
Maitland-

01:08:44.067 --> 01:08:46.261
We can't let them win.

01:08:47.738 --> 01:08:49.671
We won't.

01:09:02.652 --> 01:09:04.586
Get 'em up!

01:09:05.956 --> 01:09:08.720
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

01:09:32.115 --> 01:09:35.573
They pushed on during the night.

01:09:35.652 --> 01:09:38.542
Maybe that little creamy
has got the blackfella magic.

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:39.383
Shut up, Bull!

01:09:41.258 --> 01:09:44.750
They're gonna need more than magic
to get 'em to Darwin.

01:09:54.805 --> 01:09:56.830
Hey, Nullah.

01:09:56.907 --> 01:10:00.104
Nullah, after you're done, I need you
to help hobble these horses. All right?

01:10:00.177 --> 01:10:02.111
Yes, boss.

01:10:04.481 --> 01:10:06.608
<i>I never thought I'd see this day.</i>

01:10:06.683 --> 01:10:10.449
- We're gonna break the Drover's law.
- I plenty old enough too!

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.320
Yes, you are, and that is why you
are gonna keep an eye on the rest of us.

01:10:14.391 --> 01:10:17.019
All right?

01:10:17.094 --> 01:10:19.790
- All right, everyone. Let's be upstanding.
- Good girl, Jedda. Here.

01:10:22.232 --> 01:10:23.995
To the memory of the gentleman.

01:10:24.067 --> 01:10:27.935
- To the gentleman.
- To Flynn!

01:10:42.185 --> 01:10:44.983
I'd say one more before dinner.

01:11:00.737 --> 01:11:02.671
- Let's dance.
- No.

01:11:02.739 --> 01:11:04.468
- Come on!
- No. No.

01:11:04.541 --> 01:11:06.873
Come on. Please?

01:11:06.943 --> 01:11:09.468
- No. I don't know how.
- It's easy. I'll show you.

01:11:09.546 --> 01:11:12.140
You put your hands on my shoulders.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.811
And you step back.

01:11:20.824 --> 01:11:23.384
- Back. No, no.
- Oh, back. Sorry.

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.451
- I'm a bad teacher.
- Stop!

01:11:25.529 --> 01:11:27.690
You don't drink much, do you?

01:11:27.764 --> 01:11:29.698
No.

01:11:29.766 --> 01:11:33.759
<i>I'll give it a go. Come on.</i>
<i>I can do it. I can do it. All right?</i>

01:12:16.613 --> 01:12:19.377
<i>Now you do wrong-side business?</i>

01:12:19.449 --> 01:12:21.144
Uh-

01:12:21.218 --> 01:12:23.982
<i>No, mate. No.</i>
<i>We're just having a dance here.</i>

01:12:25.689 --> 01:12:29.819
- <i>Ceremonial dance?</i>
- Uh, yes. It's called the fox-trot.

01:12:29.893 --> 01:12:33.556
Fox dance?
You gonna teach me that dance?

01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:36.292
- Uh, you're a bit too young for her, mate.
- <i> Nullah!</i>

01:12:36.366 --> 01:12:40.462
Get down from that tree now!
Got bad spirits up there.

01:12:40.537 --> 01:12:43.005
You're in big trouble.

01:12:45.356 --> 01:12:48.435
<i> Come on, Nullah.</i>
<i>Time to go to bed now.</i>

01:12:48.511 --> 01:12:51.071
<i>You know better</i>
<i>than to go up in the tree.</i>

01:12:51.147 --> 01:12:54.275
<i>Have you ever fallen</i>
<i>into wrong-side business?</i>

01:12:56.786 --> 01:13:00.017
Uh, yeah.

01:13:01.024 --> 01:13:03.618
- Oh.
- Yeah. I was married once.

01:13:03.693 --> 01:13:06.856
- Really?
- Mmm. To a lovely girl.

01:13:10.367 --> 01:13:13.359
That was before I went off to war.

01:13:20.076 --> 01:13:22.010
And what happened?

01:13:25.448 --> 01:13:27.609
Well, I marched off
for Mother England...

01:13:27.684 --> 01:13:31.552
and by the time I came back,
she was sick...

01:13:31.621 --> 01:13:34.385
with T.B.

01:13:34.457 --> 01:13:39.417
But back then, the hospitals
wouldn't treat, um, blacks.

01:13:44.968 --> 01:13:47.937
Oh, right. I see. Yeah.

01:13:53.576 --> 01:13:55.567
Do you have children?

01:13:58.448 --> 01:14:01.383
- No.
- Well, that's a shame.

01:14:02.485 --> 01:14:04.851
I think you would have
made a great father.

01:14:07.991 --> 01:14:11.392
- You?
- No.

01:14:13.096 --> 01:14:15.656
I can't.

01:14:16.733 --> 01:14:18.360
Oh.

01:14:21.071 --> 01:14:23.062
That's too bad.

01:14:27.377 --> 01:14:29.709
You would have made a great mother.

01:14:37.887 --> 01:14:39.821
Well, good night.

01:14:42.025 --> 01:14:44.016
- Good night.
- Yeah.

01:15:17.127 --> 01:15:19.925
- Water no good, boss.
- No.

01:15:19.996 --> 01:15:21.725
Might be Carney boys
already been here, eh?

01:15:21.798 --> 01:15:24.460
There has to be water
some other place.

01:15:24.534 --> 01:15:26.559
- Next bore is five days.
- There has to be water.

01:15:26.636 --> 01:15:28.900
You can be sure Fletcher
will have been there as well.

01:15:31.174 --> 01:15:33.142
- <i>Hey, boss.</i>
- What?

01:15:33.209 --> 01:15:37.077
There's water three days' ride away.

01:15:37.147 --> 01:15:39.274
<i>We'd have to cross the Kuraman.</i>

01:15:39.349 --> 01:15:43.718
<i>The Kuraman?</i>
<i>That's Never-Never Land. No.</i>

01:15:43.787 --> 01:15:46.813
- We've got to try.
- We can't.

01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:49.154
- We've got to try.
- No one has drove the Never-Never.

01:15:49.225 --> 01:15:51.625
There's nothing to guide you.
You don't know where you are.

01:15:51.694 --> 01:15:55.596
You get caught out there,
you're gonna lose more than your cattle.

01:15:59.936 --> 01:16:02.700
I'm sorry.

01:16:04.574 --> 01:16:06.508
Boss!

01:16:06.576 --> 01:16:08.510
<i>Look!</i>

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.334
<i>He a wizard.</i>
<i>He gonna sing for us.</i>

01:16:43.246 --> 01:16:45.077
Sing?

01:16:45.148 --> 01:16:47.981
He can find his way anywhere.

01:16:48.051 --> 01:16:51.487
<i>The ancestors created songs for everything.</i>

01:16:51.554 --> 01:16:54.523
<i>For every rock and tree.</i>

01:16:54.591 --> 01:16:58.823
<i>They're all linked,</i>
<i>so when</i> gulapa, <i>the magic man...</i>

01:16:58.895 --> 01:17:02.558
<i>sings them in order, he'll sing us to water.</i>

01:17:02.632 --> 01:17:04.759
<i>Even across the Never-Never.</i>

01:17:15.078 --> 01:17:17.410
<i>And we went on for three days.</i>

01:17:18.915 --> 01:17:22.646
<i>Every day drier-hotter.</i>

01:17:22.719 --> 01:17:25.051
<i>All that dead land.</i>

01:17:25.121 --> 01:17:28.113
<i>Then come that big dust storm.</i>

01:17:33.096 --> 01:17:35.394
Keep driving into the wind!

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.625
<i>Nullah, stay close to me!</i>

01:17:39.702 --> 01:17:44.105
<i> Them cattle stop moving.</i>
<i>Magarri and Goolaj stop moving.</i>

01:17:44.173 --> 01:17:46.334
<i>We all stop moving.</i>

01:17:49.746 --> 01:17:52.647
I'm <i>gulapa.</i>

01:17:52.715 --> 01:17:56.276
I magic man. I wizard man.

01:18:10.166 --> 01:18:12.726
<i> Dead. All of them.</i>
<i>That's what he said.</i>

01:18:12.802 --> 01:18:15.794
<i>The pilot swooped down</i>
<i>to get a closer look.</i>

01:18:15.872 --> 01:18:19.205
Dead as doorposts they were.

01:18:19.275 --> 01:18:22.836
- It's a real tragedy.
- How terrible!

01:18:22.912 --> 01:18:24.903
<i>And on the eve of the ball too.</i>

01:18:24.981 --> 01:18:27.347
What were they doing in the Kuraman?

01:18:28.952 --> 01:18:30.920
<i>Nothing personal, Captain...</i>

01:18:30.987 --> 01:18:35.481
but I got a business to run,
and you got an army to feed.

01:18:35.558 --> 01:18:37.924
So let's not muck about.

01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:44.530
I suppose it's not a real war
unless someone's making a profit.

01:18:46.903 --> 01:18:50.100
- You got 'em ready to load, Neil?
- Yeah, we're right to go.

01:18:50.173 --> 01:18:54.132
'Cause I got a feeling the captain's
gonna put pen to paper.

01:18:54.210 --> 01:18:58.306
All hail the king. Yeah.

01:19:10.126 --> 01:19:12.856
<i> Where'd he come from?</i>

01:19:12.929 --> 01:19:15.295
Oh, look.

01:19:15.365 --> 01:19:18.732
Hello, little sweetie.

01:19:41.324 --> 01:19:44.157
What the bloody hell is that?

01:19:53.503 --> 01:19:55.664
Gentlemen!

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:00.568
I'm Sarah Ashley,
owner of Faraway Downs.

01:20:00.643 --> 01:20:05.512
<i>We are making delivery of 1,500 head</i>
<i>of prime F.D. branded shorthorns.</i>

01:20:05.581 --> 01:20:08.243
<i>We will require a holding yard.</i>

01:20:08.317 --> 01:20:10.877
- We're full.
- Says who?

01:20:10.953 --> 01:20:14.354
- The owner.
- You must be Mr. Carney.

01:20:14.424 --> 01:20:16.654
Too right, love.

01:20:18.194 --> 01:20:20.219
<i>Lady Ashley, I'm Emmett Dutton.</i>

01:20:20.296 --> 01:20:22.287
I'm the officer in charge
of livestock purchases.

01:20:22.365 --> 01:20:27.268
We will accept 20% less than what
the Carney Cattle Company is asking.

01:20:27.336 --> 01:20:30.965
No can do, love.
You're late. The contract's signed.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:34.874
This contract is not binding
until the cattle are loaded.

01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:40.149
Load the bloody cattle now!

01:20:40.150 --> 01:20:42.874
We've got to load the cattle
on the ship before Carney.

01:20:42.952 --> 01:20:45.785
- Get off your backsides!
- You drive 'em straight down the wharf.

01:20:45.855 --> 01:20:48.790
I'll try and keep Carney's cattle
in the yard.

01:20:52.595 --> 01:20:54.290
Load the bloody cattle now!

01:20:55.431 --> 01:20:58.798
- Drover!
- Hyah!

01:21:02.305 --> 01:21:04.432
Load!

01:21:08.377 --> 01:21:11.005
You blokes, load!

01:21:13.216 --> 01:21:15.844
Hyah!

01:21:15.918 --> 01:21:18.944
Hey, Bull!
Open the bloody crush!

01:21:19.021 --> 01:21:21.819
Come on!
Close that flamin' gate!

01:21:37.507 --> 01:21:39.168
You missed the boat, sunshine.

01:21:39.242 --> 01:21:42.541
<i>Yeah. Good luck, Drover, you drongo!</i>

01:21:42.612 --> 01:21:44.603
Over here, Drover.

01:21:56.425 --> 01:21:58.859
Hyah!

01:22:14.277 --> 01:22:16.802
<i>Drover!</i>

01:22:16.879 --> 01:22:19.609
Push 'em straight down the wharf!

01:22:22.118 --> 01:22:24.643
Hah!

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:28.019
Hyah!

01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:36.764
Hyah!

01:22:39.235 --> 01:22:41.362
<i>Hyah!</i>

01:22:43.606 --> 01:22:46.905
<i> There are cattle being</i>
<i>driven down the wharf.</i>

01:22:46.976 --> 01:22:49.706
My husband must have
a problem with the loading.

01:22:49.779 --> 01:22:53.078
<i>They're not Carney cattle.</i>

01:22:55.351 --> 01:22:57.785
- Mmm?
- It's Lady Ashley.

01:23:00.423 --> 01:23:02.357
Get out of the way!

01:23:02.425 --> 01:23:04.893
<i>Looks like, uh,</i>
<i>we've got a bit of competition...</i>

01:23:04.961 --> 01:23:07.521
back in the meat business.

01:23:16.772 --> 01:23:19.138
Now that's it!

01:23:19.208 --> 01:23:21.938
Hyah! Ho!

01:23:29.518 --> 01:23:32.544
Ho! Push them up!

01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:38.751
- Hyah!
- Cheeky bulls down the wharf!

01:23:38.828 --> 01:23:41.456
Cheeky bulls down the wharf,
Mrs. Boss!

01:24:06.822 --> 01:24:09.689
- Hyah!
- <i>Get him down the wharf. That's it, Nullah.</i>

01:24:09.759 --> 01:24:12.853
<i>Get him up, Nullah.</i>

01:24:12.929 --> 01:24:16.160
I got the last big, bloody, cheeky bull
in the big, bloody metal ship.

01:24:16.232 --> 01:24:18.029
All right!

01:24:19.135 --> 01:24:22.502
<i>Yea! Yea!</i>

01:24:26.575 --> 01:24:29.703
Lady coming through.
There's a lady coming through.

01:24:33.849 --> 01:24:36.147
Two Poor Fella rums, Ivan.

01:24:36.218 --> 01:24:38.880
Shut up!

01:24:38.955 --> 01:24:41.947
No women.
Ladies' lounge next door.

01:24:44.527 --> 01:24:48.964
<i>She's no lady, Ivan. She just drove</i>
<i>a mob of cattle across the Never-Never.</i>

01:24:49.031 --> 01:24:52.330
She deserves a drink like any man.

01:24:52.401 --> 01:24:54.801
Too bloody right.

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:57.737
Too bloody right.

01:25:09.218 --> 01:25:11.345
I never drink Poor Fella alone.

01:25:17.927 --> 01:25:21.522
Crikey!

01:25:21.597 --> 01:25:23.724
<i>One, two, three!</i>

01:25:23.799 --> 01:25:27.667
<i># Where's that jolly jumbuck</i>
<i>you've got in your tucker bag #</i>

01:25:27.737 --> 01:25:30.797
<i># You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me ##</i>

01:25:30.873 --> 01:25:34.036
I didn't want to see a single beast
from Faraway Downs...

01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:37.079
set a hoof on that wharf, Neil.

01:25:37.146 --> 01:25:40.274
But that's what happens
when you send a boy to do a man's job.

01:25:40.349 --> 01:25:42.943
Now, find out if she's going
to the ball tomorrow night.

01:25:43.019 --> 01:25:45.010
I'll take care of it myself.

01:25:57.033 --> 01:26:00.867
<i>So everybody get what they want.</i>

01:26:00.936 --> 01:26:02.927
<i>Everybody happy.</i>

01:26:03.005 --> 01:26:06.338
<i>Mrs. Boss is gonna sell Faraway Downs...</i>

01:26:06.409 --> 01:26:09.207
<i>and go back to England.</i>

01:26:09.278 --> 01:26:11.212
Shh.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.941
That's it. Good girl.

01:26:13.015 --> 01:26:16.451
<i>Drover, he get'em that horse,</i>
<i>Capricornia.</i>

01:26:16.519 --> 01:26:18.453
That's it. Good girl.

01:26:18.521 --> 01:26:21.957
<i>Everybody happy, except for me.</i>

01:26:24.794 --> 01:26:27.285
<i>'Cause I not white fella.</i>

01:26:27.363 --> 01:26:29.593
<i>I not blackfella either.</i>

01:26:29.665 --> 01:26:31.656
<i>Me half-caste.</i>

01:26:33.002 --> 01:26:35.596
<i>Creamy.</i>

01:26:35.671 --> 01:26:37.764
<i>Me belong no one.</i>

01:26:47.817 --> 01:26:50.183
Good girl.

01:26:50.252 --> 01:26:53.949
<i>Back, back, back. Back. Good.</i>

01:26:55.925 --> 01:27:01.363
<i>Easy, easy. Good, good. That's it.</i>

01:27:06.402 --> 01:27:09.337
That's a good girl. That's it.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:27:10.673 --> 01:27:13.506
You really do have a gift with horses.

01:27:15.344 --> 01:27:18.177
Up. Up.

01:27:20.549 --> 01:27:22.141
You look different.

01:27:22.218 --> 01:27:26.917
I've agreed to be patroness at the ball
at Government House tomorrow night.

01:27:26.989 --> 01:27:28.957
Yeah? And?

01:27:30.025 --> 01:27:33.461
Drover, I-

01:27:33.529 --> 01:27:35.963
I'm going to finish
what Maitland set out to do...

01:27:36.031 --> 01:27:39.831
and I am going to bring
Faraway Downs back to life.

01:27:39.902 --> 01:27:41.870
I don't follow you.

01:27:41.937 --> 01:27:44.132
Well, this is perfect.
I'm going to need a manager.

01:27:46.575 --> 01:27:50.067
Well, I thought that...

01:27:50.146 --> 01:27:53.138
it would be a good job for you.

01:27:56.152 --> 01:27:58.677
Anyway, I almost forgot something.
I got a suit for you.

01:27:58.754 --> 01:28:01.814
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Don't do that.
- Do what?

01:28:01.891 --> 01:28:04.223
The thing you do
when you get a head full of ideas.

01:28:04.293 --> 01:28:07.194
- Like crossing the Kuraman?
- <i>Come on, mate.</i>

01:28:07.263 --> 01:28:11.597
You don't know what you're talking about.
Running a station? Manager?

01:28:11.667 --> 01:28:14.932
I'm a drover. All right?
No man hires me, no man fires me.

01:28:17.006 --> 01:28:19.600
- So you don't want to go to the ball?
- Ball?

01:28:22.244 --> 01:28:24.178
Sarah.

01:28:25.447 --> 01:28:28.780
I'm as good as black to that mob up there.

01:28:28.851 --> 01:28:33.117
I mix with dingoes, not- not duchesses.

01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:39.186
They keep out of my way,
and I keep out of theirs.

01:28:39.261 --> 01:28:41.252
That's the way it is.

01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:45.164
Just because it is
doesn't mean it should be.

01:28:51.574 --> 01:28:53.565
But that's the way it is.

01:29:04.286 --> 01:29:06.220
<i>Cheer up, little fella.</i>

01:29:06.288 --> 01:29:09.553
You and that Chinaman gonna take me out
on a big night at the pictures.

01:29:09.625 --> 01:29:11.559
How?

01:29:11.627 --> 01:29:14.152
<i>You can't take half-caste</i>
<i>to picture show.</i>

01:29:14.230 --> 01:29:18.599
- Coppers take him!
- He won't be half-caste.

01:29:18.667 --> 01:29:21.727
He got every right to be there.

01:29:22.838 --> 01:29:24.829
We use magic.

01:29:26.008 --> 01:29:28.772
You got every right to be there.

01:29:33.482 --> 01:29:36.280
'Cause you're a special boy.

01:29:36.352 --> 01:29:38.684
He's a special boy.

01:29:38.754 --> 01:29:42.485
<i>Nobody gonna stop you</i>
<i>from going. Nobody.</i>

01:29:42.558 --> 01:29:45.186
<i># Somewhere #</i>

01:29:45.261 --> 01:29:48.594
# Over the rainbow #

01:29:48.664 --> 01:29:53.658
#Way up high #

01:29:53.736 --> 01:29:58.867
<i># There's a land that I heard of#</i>

01:29:58.941 --> 01:30:02.104
<i># Once in a lullaby #</i>

01:30:03.912 --> 01:30:10.511
# Somewhere over the rainbow #

01:30:10.586 --> 01:30:14.386
# Skies are blue #

01:30:15.691 --> 01:30:18.387
<i># And the dreams #</i>

01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:21.452
<i># That you dare to dream #</i>

01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:26.467
<i># Really do come true ##</i>

01:30:31.707 --> 01:30:33.732
<i>How good of you, Lady Ashley...</i>

01:30:33.809 --> 01:30:37.074
to take an interest
in Dr. Barker's work on the mission.

01:30:37.146 --> 01:30:40.877
Well, actually, Administrator,
my interest is of a more personal nature.

01:30:40.949 --> 01:30:43.474
I must say, Lady Ashley-

01:30:43.552 --> 01:30:46.020
- Smashing.
- Would you excuse me?

01:30:46.088 --> 01:30:48.682
Amongst the leading lights of Darwin.

01:30:48.757 --> 01:30:51.658
I was wondering if you could
introduce me to Dr. Barker.

01:30:51.727 --> 01:30:53.718
- Sarah?
- Ah, Captain Dutton.

01:30:53.796 --> 01:30:57.197
Lady Ashley, I'll leave you
in the capable hands of the captain.

01:30:57.266 --> 01:31:00.497
I'm sure he would be happy
to introduce you to Dr. Barker.

01:31:00.569 --> 01:31:03.129
- I want to talk to you.
- Her husband barely in the grave...

01:31:03.205 --> 01:31:05.230
and there she is
cavorting with the captain.

01:31:05.307 --> 01:31:07.298
- His mother has passed away.
- And that dress.

01:31:07.376 --> 01:31:10.106
Yes.
Bidding should go through the roof.

01:31:10.179 --> 01:31:13.046
He is a little boy.
He needs someone to look after him.

01:31:13.115 --> 01:31:15.549
- Sarah-
- I'm desperate to speak to Dr. Barker.

01:31:15.617 --> 01:31:19.075
I'm going to adopt him. It's only a matter
of time before they take him away.

01:31:19.154 --> 01:31:22.487
Adopting an Aboriginal child is much
more complicated than you realize.

01:31:22.558 --> 01:31:26.289
Neil! Come on.
I want to talk with Lady Ashley.

01:31:26.362 --> 01:31:28.523
Yeah. No. We will later, love.

01:31:28.597 --> 01:31:31.998
I don't mind if you bid for her in
the auction tonight. I won't be jealous.

01:31:32.067 --> 01:31:36.231
- She's an inspiration.
- Yeah, she's full of surprises.

01:31:36.305 --> 01:31:39.331
But surely, Doctor, life on the station
with people who care for these children...

01:31:39.408 --> 01:31:42.104
is far better than life
on a government institution.

01:31:42.177 --> 01:31:44.577
Oh. The auction.

01:31:44.646 --> 01:31:47.774
Our gracious patroness, Lady Ashley!

01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:49.909
<i>Bravo!</i>

01:31:49.985 --> 01:31:51.976
<i>Now, for the auction of the first dance-</i>

01:31:52.054 --> 01:31:56.491
The mixed-race children must be dislocated
from the primitive, full-blood Aborigine.

01:31:56.558 --> 01:32:00.119
- Do I hear a first bid? Please.
- Five pounds here.

01:32:00.195 --> 01:32:03.062
- <i>Five pounds! </i>
- How else are we to breed the black out of them?

01:32:03.132 --> 01:32:07.228
I bid more than that for a dance with Mrs. Allsop!
Remember, it's for the mission.

01:32:07.302 --> 01:32:10.738
Has anyone asked their mothers
how they feel about this?

01:32:10.806 --> 01:32:13.775
- Lady Ashley, please.
- For the war effort, do I hear 20 pounds?

01:32:13.842 --> 01:32:17.642
It's a fact of science that the Aboriginal
mother soon forgets her offspring.

01:32:17.713 --> 01:32:21.672
- Fifty pounds!
- <i>Fifty pounds!</i>

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:23.911
- Seventy pounds!
- Ninety-five!

01:32:23.986 --> 01:32:27.114
No mother forgets her child, Dr. Barker.

01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:30.249
- Lady Ashley!
- This is most inappropriate.

01:32:30.325 --> 01:32:32.486
100!

01:32:32.561 --> 01:32:36.657
- That is a new record.
- We can't very well ask their fathers, can we?

01:32:36.732 --> 01:32:39.530
- How dare you?
- Going once!

01:32:39.601 --> 01:32:42.934
- Or perhaps we should.
- Going twice!

01:32:43.005 --> 01:32:45.269
- <i>After all, they're right here in this room.</i>
- That's a lie!

01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:48.036
<i>500 quid!</i>

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:54.180
<i>500 pounds!</i>

01:32:54.249 --> 01:32:56.945
<i>Well, indeed.</i>

01:32:57.019 --> 01:32:58.953
If it isn't the man who-

01:32:59.021 --> 01:33:01.546
<i>almost single-handedly...</i>

01:33:01.623 --> 01:33:03.989
<i>made the Australian beef industry...</i>

01:33:04.059 --> 01:33:07.222
<i>what it is today.</i>

01:33:07.296 --> 01:33:11.562
<i>Mr. King Carney</i>
<i>of the Carney Cattle Company.</i>

01:33:15.737 --> 01:33:18.968
For the benefit of the missions.

01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:25.872
<i>Well, there's nothing more to say...</i>

01:33:25.948 --> 01:33:28.746
but let the king take his prize.

01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:38.221
- <i>Can I get a picture, please? Smile.</i>
- Ah.

01:33:43.532 --> 01:33:45.966
Let me say, Lady Ashley,
just how sorry I was...

01:33:46.034 --> 01:33:48.468
to hear of your husband's death...

01:33:48.537 --> 01:33:51.062
at the hands of that wild savage.

01:33:51.139 --> 01:33:53.073
A savage, yes, Mr. Carney...

01:33:53.141 --> 01:33:58.044
but you and I both know that my husband
was not killed by an Aborigine.

01:33:58.113 --> 01:34:00.172
No, I did not know that.

01:34:00.249 --> 01:34:02.945
Perhaps you should ask Mr. Fletcher.

01:34:05.287 --> 01:34:09.087
- Are you making an accusation?
- Not one I can prove.

01:34:09.157 --> 01:34:12.354
In business, I've been fortunate.

01:34:12.427 --> 01:34:15.021
<i>In family, a little less so.</i>

01:34:15.097 --> 01:34:18.794
I'm prepared to go to 75,000 pounds.

01:34:18.867 --> 01:34:21.927
This is not about the money, Mr. Carney.
There is a little boy.

01:34:22.004 --> 01:34:24.370
There is a-

01:34:24.439 --> 01:34:28.307
There are people who are living-
living on the station...

01:34:28.377 --> 01:34:30.368
for whom I am responsible.

01:34:30.445 --> 01:34:32.310
And who will take care of them?

01:34:32.381 --> 01:34:36.078
A cattle station is like a country.

01:34:36.151 --> 01:34:39.712
And you have no one to look after it.

01:34:39.788 --> 01:34:42.120
Now, I can offer protection...

01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:46.889
to every man, woman and child.

01:34:46.962 --> 01:34:48.896
And child?

01:34:50.566 --> 01:34:52.796
You will do that?

01:34:52.868 --> 01:34:56.326
How can I keep you at your word?

01:34:56.405 --> 01:34:59.465
I'll put it in the contract.

01:34:59.541 --> 01:35:02.601
<i> King Carney and Lady Ashley.</i>
<i>That was a marvelous treat.</i>

01:35:05.013 --> 01:35:09.245
<i>No one can close a deal</i>
<i>more quickly than King Carney.</i>

01:35:10.319 --> 01:35:13.186
<i>Now, the raffle for the war effort.</i>

01:35:13.255 --> 01:35:15.849
The last flying boat...

01:35:15.924 --> 01:35:18.518
leaves tomorrow because of the war.

01:35:24.733 --> 01:35:28.794
Will I tell my lawyer
to draw up a contract?

01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:33.864
<i>But the true blue Australian man</i>
<i>like King Carney is-</i>

01:35:44.987 --> 01:35:46.955
Inform your lawyer-

01:35:47.022 --> 01:35:48.455
Uh-

01:36:06.541 --> 01:36:11.308
<i>Inform your lawyer that Faraway Downs</i>
<i>is no longer for sale.</i>

01:36:19.788 --> 01:36:21.722
Fox-trot!

01:36:55.123 --> 01:36:57.216
Here you are.

01:36:57.292 --> 01:37:00.955
Well, you didn't think I was gonna
waste my dance lesson, did you?

01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:06.930
Let's really give the bastards
something to talk about, huh?

01:37:07.002 --> 01:37:10.301
Oh, crikey.

01:37:13.041 --> 01:37:15.134
She's invited that man.

01:37:16.178 --> 01:37:18.408
- Hey, Doris.
- Get you a drink, Drover?

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.415
Beer would be good.
Hello, love. Nice dress.

01:37:33.095 --> 01:37:35.359
- All right.
- Fox dance?

01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:37.421
- Fox dance.
- Mm-hmm.

01:37:39.167 --> 01:37:42.000
- Back. Back.
- Step.

01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:44.004
- Step.
- Sorry.

01:38:06.762 --> 01:38:08.753
Let's clear out of here.

01:38:24.246 --> 01:38:28.478
- There it is. First storm of the wet.
- Ahh.

01:38:30.385 --> 01:38:32.376
What's it like?

01:38:32.454 --> 01:38:34.012
It's beautiful.

01:38:34.089 --> 01:38:36.057
There's millions of birds.

01:38:36.124 --> 01:38:40.458
Creeks turn into rivers,
dry plains into lakes.

01:38:40.529 --> 01:38:44.226
Faraway Downs
will be reborn as an island-

01:38:44.299 --> 01:38:46.460
green and flowering
and fat with life.

01:38:46.535 --> 01:38:48.696
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Quick, quick, quick!

01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:51.261
We'll be cut off
from the rest of the world!

01:38:52.841 --> 01:38:55.207
- Sarah.
- Mm-hmm?

01:38:55.277 --> 01:38:58.212
In the dry- I'll be gone, droving.

01:39:08.089 --> 01:39:10.614
But right now it's raining.

01:39:30.846 --> 01:39:33.280
<i>Can you help me?
Can you help me?</i>

01:39:33.348 --> 01:39:35.407
<i>You don't need</i>
<i>to be helped any longer.</i>

01:39:35.483 --> 01:39:38.732
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

01:39:38.733 --> 01:39:39.317
I have?

01:39:39.387 --> 01:39:41.355
But why didn't you tell her before?

01:39:41.423 --> 01:39:43.414
Because she wouldn't have believed me.

01:39:44.793 --> 01:39:46.852
My darling Cath!

01:39:46.928 --> 01:39:49.556
Daddy!

01:40:08.984 --> 01:40:10.918
Hey, Drover.

01:40:34.342 --> 01:40:36.310
Maitland Ashley met his death...

01:40:36.378 --> 01:40:40.075
at the hands of a wild savage, did he?

01:40:40.148 --> 01:40:43.345
You're not part of any plan
concerning this family.

01:40:43.418 --> 01:40:45.409
Nothing's in your name...

01:40:45.487 --> 01:40:49.617
and if anything should happen to
my darling Cath, you lose everything.

01:41:00.368 --> 01:41:04.031
There's no place like home.

01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:45.264
<i>Just like Drover say,</i>
<i>that rain make everything come alive.</i>

01:42:46.441 --> 01:42:49.001
<i>That land, it grow green and fat...</i>

01:42:49.077 --> 01:42:52.478
<i>and we all go back to Faraway Downs.</i>

01:42:53.782 --> 01:42:56.774
<i>Mrs. Boss happy. Drover happy.</i>

01:42:56.851 --> 01:42:59.911
<i>Even that copper Callahan happy.</i>

01:42:59.988 --> 01:43:02.582
<i>Mrs. Boss say he likes her tea so much...</i>

01:43:02.657 --> 01:43:05.922
<i>it gives him a blind eye-</i>

01:43:05.994 --> 01:43:08.258
<i>make me invisible, keep me safe.</i>

01:43:10.265 --> 01:43:12.256
<i>I hear for the first time...</i>

01:43:12.333 --> 01:43:14.563
<i>that thing called...</i>

01:43:14.636 --> 01:43:16.900
<i>Christmas.</i>

01:43:27.015 --> 01:43:30.109
<i>Then the rain, it stops.</i>

01:43:31.686 --> 01:43:35.622
<i>And that Drover, he go droving.</i>

01:43:38.259 --> 01:43:42.218
<i>That Mrs. Boss,</i>
<i>she always misses Drover.</i>

01:43:42.297 --> 01:43:45.460
<i>But I know he's gonna come back.</i>

01:43:54.676 --> 01:43:56.667
Whoo! Yeah!

01:44:01.249 --> 01:44:03.479
<i> King George</i>
<i>tell me you gotta be looking out.</i>

01:44:03.551 --> 01:44:08.113
<i>'Cause that croc,</i>
<i>he always watching, he always waiting.</i>

01:44:28.576 --> 01:44:30.635
Hah! Get up!

01:44:38.319 --> 01:44:40.879
<i>That Fletcher, he the new king now.</i>

01:44:50.765 --> 01:44:55.099
Emmett, why didn't you radio?
I'm so glad you're here.

01:44:55.170 --> 01:44:56.933
Would you get some tea, Bandy?

01:45:01.009 --> 01:45:03.341
<i>Geez, you done the place up nice.</i>

01:45:03.411 --> 01:45:06.608
I hope you don't mind.
Bandy let me in.

01:45:07.949 --> 01:45:11.385
My father would have been proud.

01:45:11.452 --> 01:45:13.386
It's bloody beautiful.

01:45:13.454 --> 01:45:17.288
<i>Geez, I bet you got all the mod cons.</i>

01:45:17.358 --> 01:45:19.758
What do you want?

01:45:21.930 --> 01:45:25.366
What I've always wanted-
Faraway Downs.

01:45:25.433 --> 01:45:27.367
Bandy, call the men.

01:45:27.435 --> 01:45:29.562
Bunchemup, Mr. Fletcher needs
to be escorted off the property-

01:45:29.637 --> 01:45:32.231
Callahan won't be having
any more cups of tea.

01:45:33.508 --> 01:45:35.567
I will though. Cup of tea.

01:45:35.643 --> 01:45:39.044
<i>Thanks, Bandy.</i>
<i>You know how I like it. Yeah.</i>

01:45:40.148 --> 01:45:42.878
It's all right, Bandy.

01:45:42.951 --> 01:45:45.317
<i>You know, these days,</i>
<i>I can pull a few strings.</i>

01:45:45.386 --> 01:45:48.082
I can probably bring your creamy in,
if you like.

01:45:48.156 --> 01:45:52.058
Or... I can talk to Dr. Barker
and get you guardianship.

01:45:52.126 --> 01:45:54.754
- I will never sell you my land.
- <i>Your land?</i>

01:45:54.829 --> 01:45:57.696
My family worked this property
for three generations.

01:45:57.765 --> 01:46:00.256
My father died
making people like you rich.

01:46:00.335 --> 01:46:02.565
<i>Faraway Downs belongs to me.</i>

01:46:04.939 --> 01:46:09.308
Just like... you believe
the little creamy belongs to you.

01:46:10.712 --> 01:46:12.942
<i>I'll pay you what it's worth.</i>

01:46:13.014 --> 01:46:16.780
Can use the money, go south,
get the little one an education.

01:46:16.851 --> 01:46:19.319
I'll go to the highest levels
of government, to the High Court.

01:46:19.387 --> 01:46:21.321
Beyond this country, if I have to.

01:46:21.389 --> 01:46:23.584
An unmarried woman,
living with the likes of the Drover?

01:46:23.658 --> 01:46:27.822
I will tell your wife he is your son!

01:46:27.895 --> 01:46:30.762
That would be a mistake.

01:46:34.602 --> 01:46:36.536
Kimberley spear.

01:46:38.539 --> 01:46:40.973
Glass-tipped.

01:46:42.443 --> 01:46:44.741
Real collector's items.

01:46:46.414 --> 01:46:50.612
<i>Oh! You're missing one.</i>

01:46:50.685 --> 01:46:54.280
<i>Anyway, I was just out here,</i>
<i>checking on all the properties.</i>

01:46:54.355 --> 01:46:57.620
Might do a little
buffalo hunting later. Yeah.

01:46:57.692 --> 01:46:59.922
Oh.

01:46:59.994 --> 01:47:02.929
Did you hear about the king?

01:47:02.997 --> 01:47:06.296
Terrible accident. Yeah.

01:47:06.367 --> 01:47:08.460
<i>Very dangerous place out here,</i>
<i>even for locals...</i>

01:47:08.536 --> 01:47:10.629
<i>like the Drover and the little creamy.</i>

01:47:10.705 --> 01:47:12.969
<i>You with me?</i>

01:47:13.041 --> 01:47:15.066
Anyway...

01:47:15.143 --> 01:47:18.169
you ought to think about it, Lady Ashley.

01:47:18.246 --> 01:47:22.080
After all, pride's not power.

01:47:29.857 --> 01:47:32.155
The Drover mustn't know.

01:47:33.261 --> 01:47:35.991
<i>Hyah! Hyah!</i>

01:47:36.064 --> 01:47:39.192
Drover! It's the Drover!

01:47:46.841 --> 01:47:48.775
Hey! Yah!

01:48:03.858 --> 01:48:05.917
Come on, you two! Wake up!

01:48:05.993 --> 01:48:08.291
Come on!

01:48:08.363 --> 01:48:11.264
- Come on. Wake up! We got brumbies to break.
- All right, all right.

01:48:23.644 --> 01:48:28.240
Yeah, break him. Ride that brumby!
Ride him! Ride him!

01:48:28.316 --> 01:48:33.720
Yea, Drover! Ride him!
Yeah, Drover! Drover!

01:48:35.623 --> 01:48:38.421
- You a man, Drover?
- Yeah, I try to be.

01:48:38.493 --> 01:48:41.053
Sometimes man
got to get away from woman.

01:48:41.129 --> 01:48:43.063
Maybe.

01:48:43.131 --> 01:48:46.259
- That's why you go droving.
- I go droving 'cause that's my job.

01:48:46.334 --> 01:48:49.235
If you don't go droving,
you not a man.

01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:54.774
All right, boys. That'll do.

01:48:54.842 --> 01:48:56.776
Bring 'em down
to the back paddock, will you?

01:48:56.844 --> 01:48:58.903
King George tell me
I gotta go walkabout.

01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:03.178
If I a man, I gotta go walkabout.
Learn'em be a man.

01:49:04.685 --> 01:49:06.619
Yeah.

01:49:06.687 --> 01:49:09.918
Listen, it's up to Mrs. Boss
what you do, all right?

01:49:09.991 --> 01:49:12.789
<i> Come on inside, boys.</i>
<i>It's time for dinner.</i>

01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:15.124
<i>I'm coming. Jedda, come on!</i>

01:49:15.196 --> 01:49:17.187
Come on, Jedda.

01:49:21.936 --> 01:49:25.235
<i>One day, Captain Dutton came and visit us.</i>

01:49:25.306 --> 01:49:28.571
<i>He tell Drover</i>
<i>about the big army drove.</i>

01:49:28.643 --> 01:49:29.524
<i>## </i>

01:49:29.525 --> 01:49:31.771
And we need
the best stockmen possible.

01:49:31.846 --> 01:49:35.145
- It may take six months or so.
- Overland.

01:49:35.216 --> 01:49:38.014
Absolutely not. You just got back.

01:49:46.027 --> 01:49:48.552
What's wrong?

01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:51.894
I'm just not used to people
making decisions for me. That's all.

01:49:51.966 --> 01:49:55.367
<i>I was just expressing an opinion.</i>

01:49:55.436 --> 01:49:58.337
Captain Dutton was telling me about
this wonderful School of the Air.

01:49:58.406 --> 01:50:01.534
It's conducted all across the country.

01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:04.373
He wants to go walkabout
with King George.

01:50:04.445 --> 01:50:07.471
That's ridiculous.
He's a little boy. It's not safe.

01:50:07.548 --> 01:50:11.678
<i>He'd be safer in Arnhem Land than</i>
<i>he would be hanging around here.</i>

01:50:11.752 --> 01:50:14.243
- I thought you said-
- <i>You can't change him, Sarah.</i>

01:50:15.923 --> 01:50:18.255
I thought you said
it had nothing to do with you.

01:50:18.326 --> 01:50:20.385
It doesn't.

01:50:20.461 --> 01:50:24.227
<i>It's just sooner or later,</i>
<i>you're gonna have to let that boy go.</i>

01:50:26.567 --> 01:50:28.831
<i>I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

01:50:28.903 --> 01:50:32.532
<i>If he doesn't go through ceremony,</i>
<i>he'll have no country.</i>

01:50:32.607 --> 01:50:35.235
He'll have no story, no dreaming.

01:50:36.944 --> 01:50:38.935
And he'll be all alone.

01:50:42.884 --> 01:50:45.375
<i>This big army drove-</i>

01:50:45.453 --> 01:50:48.513
- Let's have dinner, shall we?
- <i>I'm gonna take it.</i>

01:51:50.151 --> 01:51:52.813
Time to go walkabout, Mrs. Boss.

01:51:54.021 --> 01:51:57.650
- You belong here.
- No, Mrs. Boss.

01:52:33.227 --> 01:52:36.458
<i>Sarah, I gotta go.</i>

01:52:36.530 --> 01:52:38.464
Sarah!

01:52:39.934 --> 01:52:41.868
<i>Drover!</i>

01:52:43.237 --> 01:52:45.705
Drover!

01:52:48.442 --> 01:52:50.706
He's not down at the billabong!

01:52:50.778 --> 01:52:52.276
Then he's gone walkabout.

01:52:52.277 --> 01:52:55.511
He wouldn't have just left
without saying good-bye.

01:52:55.583 --> 01:52:58.484
Get the pack horse ready.
We're going up to Punctuation Point.

01:52:58.552 --> 01:53:00.486
- Sing Song?
- <i>Yes?</i>

01:53:00.554 --> 01:53:03.250
- Tin food. We're going after him.
- You're not listening.

01:53:03.324 --> 01:53:06.122
- What?
- <i>Sarah, he's gone on walkabout!</i>

01:53:06.193 --> 01:53:08.024
Oh, come on, Drover.
He is a child.

01:53:08.095 --> 01:53:12.555
Well, he's not our child!
He's an Aboriginal child! He's gone walkabout!

01:53:12.633 --> 01:53:14.863
- Bandy!
- <i>The next time you see him...</i>

01:53:14.935 --> 01:53:16.926
will be when he wants to see you.

01:53:17.004 --> 01:53:19.598
He'll be halfway to Arnhem Land by now.
You'll never find him.

01:53:19.674 --> 01:53:22.575
You could find him.
You know that land better than anyone.

01:53:22.643 --> 01:53:24.907
- You and Magarri can find him.
- <i>And do what, huh?</i>

01:53:24.979 --> 01:53:28.039
<i>Bring him back here and lock him up?</i>
<i>You could start your own mission.</i>

01:53:28.115 --> 01:53:31.573
Oh! You're just trying to be clever
because you don't want to be responsible.

01:53:31.652 --> 01:53:33.415
He's not my son!

01:53:36.057 --> 01:53:37.991
What did you say?

01:53:40.828 --> 01:53:44.059
- I better go.
- <i>Don't leave! Drover, don't.</i>

01:53:45.266 --> 01:53:47.791
I understood when you said
you had to be free.

01:53:47.868 --> 01:53:52.168
I understood that,
but that was between you and me.

01:53:52.239 --> 01:53:54.469
<i>But it's different now.</i>

01:53:54.542 --> 01:53:56.703
We've got Nullah.

01:53:58.212 --> 01:54:00.146
- I gotta go.
- I need you to stay.

01:54:00.214 --> 01:54:03.047
- I'll be back in six months.
- I need you to stay with me!

01:54:03.117 --> 01:54:05.244
And if you can't do that, then I-

01:54:05.319 --> 01:54:07.913
I would prefer it if you didn't return.

01:54:12.493 --> 01:54:14.461
All right.

01:54:14.528 --> 01:54:16.462
You're the boss.

01:54:20.367 --> 01:54:23.165
Drover.

01:54:34.014 --> 01:54:36.983
<i>I can feel them bad spirits coming...</i>

01:54:37.051 --> 01:54:39.986
<i>so I chase after that King George.</i>

01:54:40.054 --> 01:54:43.683
<i>But that Callahan,</i>
<i>he been stopped drinking Mrs. Boss's tea.</i>

01:54:48.763 --> 01:54:52.756
<i>He lose his blind eye,</i>
<i>and I not invisible anymore.</i>

01:54:59.406 --> 01:55:01.738
Jedda!

01:55:03.778 --> 01:55:06.303
Fletcher,
we've apprehended that young'un.

01:55:07.047 --> 01:55:12.178
<i>And in the course of our duties, we arrested</i>
<i>the suspected murderer of Lord Ashley.</i>

01:55:12.253 --> 01:55:13.845
<i>King George.</i>

01:55:20.861 --> 01:55:23.830
No!

01:55:25.199 --> 01:55:27.997
You finally lifted the game, Callahan.
Good on you.

01:55:28.068 --> 01:55:31.299
- Things are looking up.
- <i> The militarization of Darwin.</i>

01:55:31.372 --> 01:55:34.739
<i>Their cattle yards</i>
<i>are alive with military activity...</i>

01:55:34.809 --> 01:55:38.540
<i>and the Carney Cattle office,</i>
<i>once that proud icon of Darwin...</i>

01:55:38.612 --> 01:55:41.376
is now military headquarters.

01:55:41.448 --> 01:55:44.178
<i>At 6:15 a.m. local time...</i>

01:55:44.251 --> 01:55:48.210
the United States Pacific Fleet
was attacked at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii...

01:55:48.289 --> 01:55:50.655
by the empire of Japan.

01:55:50.724 --> 01:55:54.057
The United States has joined the war.

01:55:55.229 --> 01:55:58.198
As the Japanese horde pours southward...

01:55:58.265 --> 01:56:01.928
the final evacuation of Darwin
is under way.

01:56:10.077 --> 01:56:13.240
Get those boxes cleared on the double!

01:56:13.314 --> 01:56:15.145
- Come on.
- This way, boys.

01:56:15.216 --> 01:56:16.877
Quickly. Quickly.

01:56:35.536 --> 01:56:38.403
<i>Hey, creamy! Creamy!</i>

01:56:38.472 --> 01:56:41.100
<i>Doesn't your mommy want you?</i>

01:56:51.852 --> 01:56:54.320
- <i>You filthy creamy!</i>
- Come on.

01:56:54.388 --> 01:56:57.289
Come, my child.
Come on! Come on, my child.

01:56:57.358 --> 01:56:58.985
Creamy! Hey, creamy!

01:57:22.249 --> 01:57:23.614
- Excuse me.
- Nullah!

01:57:23.684 --> 01:57:25.311
- <i>Lady Ashley.</i>
- It's Lady Ashley.

01:57:25.386 --> 01:57:27.581
- Father Benedict, you deal with this.
- Nullah!

01:57:27.655 --> 01:57:30.317
- Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!
- No! This is madness!

01:57:30.391 --> 01:57:33.292
Mrs. Boss, don't let them take me away!
I don't want to go!

01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:35.658
Was she hugging a pickaninny?

01:57:35.729 --> 01:57:37.788
People do the most extraordinary things.

01:57:37.865 --> 01:57:40.925
- Go on.
- I don't want to go! Mrs. Boss!

01:57:41.001 --> 01:57:41.676
It'll be all right.

01:57:41.677 --> 01:57:43.629
These poor unfortunates
will be safe in God's hands.

01:57:43.704 --> 01:57:46.138
These are not unfortunates!
These are children!

01:57:46.206 --> 01:57:49.175
These are no different than the children
you are taking south to protect!

01:57:49.243 --> 01:57:52.212
- Don't let them take me away! No!
- Nullah! Nullah!

01:57:52.279 --> 01:57:54.873
- She's humiliating herself.
- Please help me!

01:57:54.949 --> 01:57:57.042
- We've got to help her.
- Lady Ashley!

01:57:57.117 --> 01:57:59.881
- Help me! That's my child.
- I understand what you're saying.

01:57:59.954 --> 01:58:00.461
Please! Nullah!

01:58:00.462 --> 01:58:02.286
You don't have an essential job.
You must evacuate.

01:58:02.356 --> 01:58:06.122
- Mrs. Boss, don't let them take me away.
- The church has a plan for them.

01:58:06.193 --> 01:58:08.957
To leave those children behind
while we send ours to safety?

01:58:09.029 --> 01:58:11.657
- Control yourself, Catherine.
- How can you all be so heartless?

01:58:11.732 --> 01:58:14.633
You be a brave boy for me.
You be brave.

01:58:14.702 --> 01:58:18.263
Neil, I want you to do something about this.
I want you to help Lady Ashley.

01:58:18.339 --> 01:58:20.705
Yeah, now, look,
I could probably sort it out.

01:58:20.774 --> 01:58:23.504
Show the ladies their cabins,
and I'll see what I can do.

01:58:23.577 --> 01:58:25.135
<i>Come on, ladies.
To the upper decks.</i>

01:58:25.212 --> 01:58:27.203
I will come find you,
whatever happens.

01:58:27.281 --> 01:58:29.579
Whatever it takes,
we'll be together again. I promise.

01:58:29.650 --> 01:58:33.848
- I believe you, Mrs. Boss.
- Come along, child. Quickly. Quickly.

01:58:33.921 --> 01:58:35.855
Mrs. Boss.

01:58:37.257 --> 01:58:40.658
- I sing you to me.
- You be brave.

01:58:42.429 --> 01:58:45.057
- Nullah.
- Come, boy. Come quickly.

01:58:48.769 --> 01:58:51.431
Nullah! It'll be all right!

01:58:57.011 --> 01:59:00.003
<i>I will find you! I will!</i>

01:59:07.955 --> 01:59:11.186
<i>Nullah! Nullah!</i>

01:59:18.432 --> 01:59:21.424
I sing you to me, Mrs. Boss!

01:59:21.502 --> 01:59:24.562
And I will hear you, my darling!

01:59:30.677 --> 01:59:33.111
There's a radio tower on Mission Island...

01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:36.581
directly in the path
of the oncoming Japanese.

01:59:36.650 --> 01:59:39.141
Be the first place the Japs hit.

01:59:40.721 --> 01:59:42.655
You're monstrous.

01:59:46.693 --> 01:59:49.753
I'll have the original contract with
the original offer drawn up and ready.

01:59:49.830 --> 01:59:53.994
<i>You can get yourself a room at Ivan's,</i>
<i>and I'll get you a job with Cath at H.Q.</i>

01:59:54.068 --> 01:59:58.061
<i>I'll give you a call.</i>
<i>You will do this, Lady Ashley.</i>

01:59:58.138 --> 02:00:01.972
After all, pride's not power.

02:00:05.646 --> 02:00:08.774
Yeah, pride's not power.

02:00:39.012 --> 02:00:41.537
<i>Mission Island to H.Q.</i>

02:00:41.615 --> 02:00:44.846
Mission Island to H.Q.
Visibility good.

02:00:44.918 --> 02:00:47.887
<i>All clear. Over and out.</i>

02:00:49.623 --> 02:00:53.719
<i># Ave Maria #</i>

02:00:53.794 --> 02:00:57.992
<i> I was on Mission Island</i>
<i>lock-lock for two whole months.</i>

02:00:59.066 --> 02:01:03.002
<i>Mrs. Boss promised she'd come for me...</i>

02:01:03.070 --> 02:01:05.561
<i>so I play my magic song.</i>

02:01:10.077 --> 02:01:12.045
<i>But that Drover-</i>

02:01:12.112 --> 02:01:14.740
<i>him been gone far, far away...</i>

02:01:14.815 --> 02:01:17.215
<i>on that big army drove.</i>

02:01:18.318 --> 02:01:21.651
<i>Him been gone so long, so far away...</i>

02:01:21.722 --> 02:01:26.318
<i>maybe he not hear me.</i>

02:01:28.128 --> 02:01:31.894
Leave it off.

02:01:31.965 --> 02:01:34.092
What? No whistling?

02:01:34.168 --> 02:01:36.500
Just not that tune.

02:01:49.917 --> 02:01:52.385
<i>Not that one either.</i>

02:01:52.452 --> 02:01:54.852
<i>No music?</i>

02:01:54.922 --> 02:01:57.049
You must be properly hurtin'
for Mrs. Boss.

02:01:57.124 --> 02:01:59.058
Shut your damper hole, will ya?

02:01:59.126 --> 02:02:01.686
I can see why Mrs. Boss
gave you the boot.

02:02:01.762 --> 02:02:04.196
- You wanna know why she gave me the boot?
- Yeah.

02:02:04.264 --> 02:02:06.926
'Cause I wouldn't stop Nullah
from going walkabout.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.968
He went walkabout?

02:02:09.036 --> 02:02:11.561
Yeah. I tried to explain to her
what that means, but-

02:02:11.638 --> 02:02:14.436
- <i>See him go?</i>
- Nah.

02:02:14.508 --> 02:02:17.204
So he's gone.

02:02:17.277 --> 02:02:20.940
- Yeah. I told you. He went walkabout.
- You don't know?

02:02:21.014 --> 02:02:22.914
Eh?

02:02:22.983 --> 02:02:27.317
<i>That little fella, he could have walked</i>
<i>into a big hole or got eaten by a croc.</i>

02:02:27.387 --> 02:02:30.823
- What if the cops have got him?
- Don't you bloody start. He's an Aboriginal boy!

02:02:30.891 --> 02:02:36.295
Wait. You're just hiding behind that
blackfella business so you don't get hurt.

02:02:36.363 --> 02:02:38.831
<i>This isn't about walkabout, is it?</i>

02:02:38.899 --> 02:02:42.335
Is it? You're running.

02:02:43.537 --> 02:02:45.937
- I'm not running, mate.
- Yes, you are, brother.

02:02:48.008 --> 02:02:51.466
<i>You're scared of getting your heart hurt</i>
<i>like before, when my sister died.</i>

02:02:54.781 --> 02:02:57.909
<i>But knowing you, you probably never</i>
<i>told Mrs. Boss that you loved her, eh?</i>

02:03:00.053 --> 02:03:03.113
You got no love in your heart...

02:03:03.190 --> 02:03:05.181
<i>you got nothing.</i>

02:03:08.829 --> 02:03:11.798
<i>No dreaming, no story.</i>

02:03:12.866 --> 02:03:14.834
Nothing.

02:03:25.312 --> 02:03:27.712
<i>Hey. Big mob of army fellas.</i>

02:03:30.417 --> 02:03:32.885
Must be diggers, eh?

02:03:32.953 --> 02:03:35.888
<i>They're not diggers, mate.</i>
<i>They're Yanks.</i>

02:03:35.956 --> 02:03:38.424
What the bloody hell are they doing here?

02:04:11.758 --> 02:04:13.692
Once you've signed the contract...

02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:17.025
I'll get one of the brothers to take you
out to the mission on the sloop.

02:04:17.097 --> 02:04:21.090
You can be happily reunited
with your little creamy.

02:04:21.168 --> 02:04:23.728
No loss of pride, Lady Ashley.

02:04:27.841 --> 02:04:30.275
<i>Good morning, Ivan!</i>

02:04:33.246 --> 02:04:37.683
- You look happy.
- I am. I get my little boy today.

02:04:37.751 --> 02:04:41.414
Oh, and, Ivan, we're leaving
the territory tomorrow.

02:04:41.488 --> 02:04:44.719
Good! I need the room.

02:04:44.791 --> 02:04:47.259
I'll miss you too, Ivan!

02:05:19.025 --> 02:05:22.017
- Cath, sorry I'm late.
- Quick changeover, girls.

02:05:23.029 --> 02:05:25.395
- Did you speak to Neil?
- Yes.

02:05:25.465 --> 02:05:28.059
I'm seeing him about Nullah
after my shift.

02:05:28.135 --> 02:05:30.626
- Look. I was just thinking-
- What?

02:05:30.704 --> 02:05:33.104
About Nullah.

02:05:33.173 --> 02:05:35.607
What?

02:06:05.172 --> 02:06:07.231
I'm getting a signal from Mission Island.

02:06:07.307 --> 02:06:10.538
Large air formation bearing down.
Suspect visibility.

02:06:28.528 --> 02:06:32.225
If you can't understand the ordnance...

02:06:32.299 --> 02:06:34.290
how can you understand the order?

02:06:49.316 --> 02:06:51.716
What's happening?

02:06:58.258 --> 02:07:00.988
<i>We're under attack!</i>
<i>We're under attack!</i>

02:07:08.635 --> 02:07:11.001
Hurry up!

02:07:20.146 --> 02:07:21.704
Let them free!

02:08:42.495 --> 02:08:47.626
<i>Drover! Hey! Drover! Magarri!</i>

02:08:47.701 --> 02:08:52.104
Goolaj, where's Mrs. Boss?

02:08:52.172 --> 02:08:55.664
She at that army H.Q. - old Carney place!

02:08:55.742 --> 02:08:58.267
Okay. Come on!

02:09:00.046 --> 02:09:02.014
Drover,
I'll see you at Faraway Downs!

02:09:05.719 --> 02:09:09.815
You can't go in there, mate!

02:09:14.694 --> 02:09:17.322
- Drover!
- Callahan?

02:09:17.397 --> 02:09:19.524
<i>Is she in there? Sarah Ashley.</i>

02:09:19.599 --> 02:09:21.863
- It's too late.
- She's in there!

02:09:21.935 --> 02:09:23.926
Hold it, mate!

02:09:25.071 --> 02:09:29.337
Let me in there! Sarah! Sarah!

02:09:29.409 --> 02:09:32.708
Let me in there!

02:09:32.779 --> 02:09:36.010
I'll handle this. You get your man
out of here right now!

02:09:36.082 --> 02:09:38.516
- She's a part of dreaming now.
- Get out of my way!

02:09:38.585 --> 02:09:40.052
- Go on! Hit me!
- Get out of my-

02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:42.816
Go on! Hit me!
It's not gonna bring her back.

02:09:42.889 --> 02:09:44.584
She's in there! Sarah!

02:09:44.658 --> 02:09:47.388
Clear the corridor! Come on!

02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:50.725
Nobody past this point unless they're
at death's door or already through it.

02:09:50.797 --> 02:09:52.765
<i>You got a name?</i>

02:09:52.832 --> 02:09:55.426
Ashley. Sarah Ashley.

02:10:00.006 --> 02:10:01.940
What did he say?

02:10:40.714 --> 02:10:43.376
<i>But right now it's raining.</i>

02:10:44.651 --> 02:10:48.417
<i>It's different now.</i>
<i>We've got Nullah.</i>

02:10:51.057 --> 02:10:53.048
<i>Here you are.</i>

02:11:06.206 --> 02:11:08.436
<i>She deserves a drink like any man.</i>

02:11:10.510 --> 02:11:12.501
- <i> Too bloody right.</i>
- <i> Crikey!</i>

02:11:18.585 --> 02:11:21.179
Hey, no boongs in here.

02:11:36.636 --> 02:11:38.627
You didn't say that, did you?

02:11:38.705 --> 02:11:41.265
That's how it is.

02:11:42.575 --> 02:11:44.566
Just because it is...

02:11:46.546 --> 02:11:49.538
doesn't-
doesn't mean it should be.

02:11:53.186 --> 02:11:55.279
Serve him a fuckin' drink!

02:12:20.747 --> 02:12:23.511
Ah, what does it matter?

02:12:24.951 --> 02:12:26.976
I'm a total bloody ruin.

02:12:27.053 --> 02:12:30.489
<i>I'm evacuating south,</i>
<i>like everybody else.</i>

02:12:30.557 --> 02:12:32.718
You're short one glass.

02:12:37.297 --> 02:12:41.165
<i>One... more... glass.</i>

02:12:48.975 --> 02:12:53.036
I leave this place
for the looters and the Japs.

02:12:58.451 --> 02:13:00.442
Why not the boongs?

02:13:17.170 --> 02:13:20.333
<i>I saw her this morning...</i>

02:13:20.406 --> 02:13:22.374
<i>before she went to the work.</i>

02:13:22.442 --> 02:13:24.433
<i>She was so happy.</i>

02:13:25.812 --> 02:13:28.610
She was gonna get that...

02:13:28.681 --> 02:13:31.878
<i>little boy and go south.</i>

02:13:33.286 --> 02:13:35.447
What about the children
on Mission Island?

02:13:35.521 --> 02:13:40.015
<i>The creamies?</i>
<i>They are left out there.</i>

02:13:40.093 --> 02:13:43.961
- They left them out there?
- Safe in the hands of God.

02:13:44.030 --> 02:13:46.328
They left them-

02:13:46.399 --> 02:13:48.993
<i>They say the island was hit first.</i>

02:13:49.068 --> 02:13:52.060
<i>They say no one would have survived.</i>

02:13:57.210 --> 02:14:00.008
They say a lot of things.

02:14:02.916 --> 02:14:04.907
<i>There's been some mistake.</i>

02:14:06.019 --> 02:14:08.010
That's Cath Fletcher.

02:14:09.222 --> 02:14:11.281
Oh, God. Cath.

02:14:11.357 --> 02:14:14.690
- Oh, God!
- Sort her out.

02:14:14.761 --> 02:14:17.696
- Sarah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, God!

02:14:17.764 --> 02:14:19.925
Nullah. I've got to get to Nullah.

02:14:19.999 --> 02:14:22.763
- Sarah, the Japs hit the mission first.
- No!

02:14:22.835 --> 02:14:25.827
- No! I don't believe you! I don't believe it!
- Sarah, look at me.

02:14:25.905 --> 02:14:27.896
No one can get out there.

02:14:32.178 --> 02:14:35.841
No one.

02:14:37.016 --> 02:14:38.950
<i>I need help to get to the island.</i>

02:14:39.018 --> 02:14:41.987
- Half the Jap navy's out there, you stupid bastard.
- I have the Lord on my side.

02:14:42.055 --> 02:14:44.615
I don't give a damn who's on your side!

02:14:46.726 --> 02:14:49.388
God works in mysterious ways, Brother.
Go, go, go!

02:14:49.462 --> 02:14:51.123
<i>Magarri, secure the boat.</i>

02:14:51.197 --> 02:14:53.563
- <i>Thank you, Lord. Thank you.</i>
- Thank you, Bull.

02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:04.573
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

02:15:09.215 --> 02:15:12.707
Sarah, we leave at first light.

02:15:32.905 --> 02:15:34.702
Ivan.

02:15:34.774 --> 02:15:38.107
- Check the second dormitory.
- Okay.

02:16:15.648 --> 02:16:17.582
Nullah.

02:16:21.954 --> 02:16:23.888
Oh.

02:16:49.682 --> 02:16:51.912
Come on. It's all right.

02:16:53.519 --> 02:16:55.952
- Shh.
- Where are the other-Are there other boys?

02:16:56.022 --> 02:16:58.013
- I don't know.
- <i>Are there any other boys?</i>

02:16:58.091 --> 02:17:00.582
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- Okay.

02:17:00.660 --> 02:17:02.651
Drover?

02:17:04.664 --> 02:17:07.599
- Nullah.
- Drover!

02:17:09.735 --> 02:17:12.602
<i>Drover!</i>

02:17:12.672 --> 02:17:15.139
I knew you'd come.
I sing you to me.

02:17:15.208 --> 02:17:17.142
Oh.

02:17:20.245 --> 02:17:22.806
- Magarri!
- Hey, little fella.

02:17:29.455 --> 02:17:31.821
Mrs. Boss come too?

02:17:31.891 --> 02:17:34.120
Where's Mrs. Boss?

02:17:34.192 --> 02:17:36.183
We, uh-

02:17:36.262 --> 02:17:39.527
We can't say her name anymore,
little mate.

02:17:42.869 --> 02:17:45.030
All right?

02:17:45.103 --> 02:17:48.198
Hey. Now you listen to me.
I need your help.

02:17:48.273 --> 02:17:50.333
I'm gonna get these fellas
off the island.

02:17:50.409 --> 02:17:52.741
You're gonna have to be strong.
Can you do that?

02:17:52.812 --> 02:17:54.803
- Mm-hmm.
- Good boy.

02:17:56.082 --> 02:17:59.142
All right. Go and get
your little mates down there.

02:17:59.218 --> 02:18:01.982
- Come over here. Let's go.
- Come with me. It's okay.

02:18:02.054 --> 02:18:05.512
- <i>Come on.</i>
- We're gonna get you all off this island, all right?

02:18:05.591 --> 02:18:07.888
All right.
Boys, we're gonna have to swim.

02:18:07.959 --> 02:18:11.726
We have to be quiet, like a turtle.
Okay?

02:18:11.797 --> 02:18:15.062
<i>Now, I'm gonna take you home on a ship.</i>
<i>It's over there. You see it?</i>

02:18:25.411 --> 02:18:27.709
Let's go, boys! Let's go!

02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:29.714
Quick, quick, quick!

02:18:30.750 --> 02:18:32.683
Ivan.

02:18:33.986 --> 02:18:36.477
- Ivan. Swim the big boys down to the sloop.
- Right.

02:18:36.556 --> 02:18:39.888
Use the current and drift it
down to the end of the wharf. Go.

02:18:39.959 --> 02:18:42.791
Come on, boys. Quick.

02:18:42.861 --> 02:18:45.057
Run! Run!

02:18:45.130 --> 02:18:47.565
Quick, quick!

02:18:47.633 --> 02:18:49.566
<i>Let's go.</i>

02:19:01.214 --> 02:19:03.773
Ah, crikey.

02:19:09.487 --> 02:19:12.548
Hey.

02:19:14.727 --> 02:19:17.287
- I take this mob walkabout.
- You'll never make it.

02:19:17.362 --> 02:19:19.331
Well, you gotta make it!

02:19:19.397 --> 02:19:22.093
You got family now.

02:19:22.168 --> 02:19:24.397
You gotta drove this mob home, Drover.

02:19:30.009 --> 02:19:32.568
Good luck, brother.

02:19:35.348 --> 02:19:37.248
- Go, go.
- That's it. Good boy.

02:20:17.690 --> 02:20:18.679
Magarri.

02:20:24.030 --> 02:20:26.794
<i>Up the ladder, boys. Quick. Hurry now.</i>

02:20:34.573 --> 02:20:36.200
Come on.

02:21:19.719 --> 02:21:21.710
Drove 'em home, Drover.

02:22:08.567 --> 02:22:10.501
Sergeant, get the men on the trucks.

02:22:10.569 --> 02:22:13.470
<i>We're evacuating within 15 minutes.</i>

02:22:13.539 --> 02:22:17.805
<i>We rendezvous with the main convoy</i>
<i>at 0800 hours at Adelaide.</i>

02:22:18.811 --> 02:22:20.904
<i>Start the truck, Sergeant Lapin.</i>

02:22:22.181 --> 02:22:25.275
<i>If anyone is lagging,</i>
<i>use whatever force is necessary.</i>

02:22:25.351 --> 02:22:27.876
Every single man, Lapin.
And don't take no for an answer.

02:22:27.953 --> 02:22:32.981
- <i>You won't have to wait for us, Captain.</i>
- Move! Come on! Move!

02:22:33.058 --> 02:22:36.186
Thanks for coming down, Mr. Fletcher.

02:22:36.262 --> 02:22:38.321
It's my awful duty to inform you...

02:22:38.397 --> 02:22:40.558
<i>that your wife, Catherine-</i>

02:22:42.935 --> 02:22:45.267
My wife is dead?

02:22:45.337 --> 02:22:49.364
<i>It's a funny old world, isn't it?</i>

02:22:49.442 --> 02:22:51.433
Generous to a fault.

02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:55.844
<i>Did you know that Lady Ashley insisted...</i>

02:22:55.915 --> 02:22:57.906
that my wife work her shift...

02:23:00.419 --> 02:23:06.221
so that she could see
some... half-caste kid on the mission?

02:23:06.292 --> 02:23:08.453
<i>Now my wife's dead.</i>

02:23:10.396 --> 02:23:12.660
Now I've lost everything.

02:23:24.143 --> 02:23:26.202
<i>We have to go, Sarah.</i>

02:23:39.992 --> 02:23:43.587
Come on! Come on, boys!

02:23:45.998 --> 02:23:48.592
They'll be flying in here
and blowing us up any minute!

02:23:48.667 --> 02:23:50.726
<i>Get on the bloody trucks!</i>

02:24:08.420 --> 02:24:12.254
<i>Sarah, please. We have to go now.</i>

02:24:19.131 --> 02:24:21.622
<i>My magic not good.</i>

02:24:21.700 --> 02:24:23.634
<i>All the smoke.</i>

02:24:25.538 --> 02:24:27.802
<i>But then he speak to me.</i>

02:24:27.873 --> 02:24:32.537
<i>Grandfather.</i>

02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:56.960
Come on, love. Don't muck about.

02:25:05.911 --> 02:25:07.845
Can you hear that?

02:25:09.281 --> 02:25:11.249
<i>Music. Can you hear it?</i>

02:25:11.317 --> 02:25:13.581
Come on, boys.

02:25:20.726 --> 02:25:22.751
Sing.

02:25:26.532 --> 02:25:28.523
- <i>Sarah, please.</i>
- Can't you hear it?

02:25:38.277 --> 02:25:40.507
It's children singing.

02:26:03.168 --> 02:26:06.797
- <i>Sarah! What's going on?</i>
- Just give her another minute.

02:26:33.465 --> 02:26:35.933
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

02:26:37.770 --> 02:26:40.739
Mrs. Boss!

02:26:42.941 --> 02:26:45.842
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

02:26:49.148 --> 02:26:51.412
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

02:26:57.022 --> 02:26:58.887
Nullah!

02:26:58.957 --> 02:27:01.448
- Mrs. Boss!
- Ah!

02:27:01.527 --> 02:27:04.963
- I can say your name!
- Oh!

02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:09.091
Mrs. Boss. I sing you to me
like the first night I see you.

02:27:09.168 --> 02:27:12.399
Them Japs nearly got us.
We had to swim'em.

02:27:12.471 --> 02:27:16.134
Some of them little fellas
from the desert can't swim'em.

02:27:16.208 --> 02:27:20.144
But the Drover take 'em
on his back like a turtle.

02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:24.613
What did you say? What?

02:27:24.683 --> 02:27:26.617
Drover.

02:27:54.213 --> 02:27:56.977
You're alive! Oh, God!

02:28:26.078 --> 02:28:28.638
Sarah, what's going on?
I can't hold the sergeant any longer!

02:28:32.618 --> 02:28:35.712
Come on, boys!

02:28:35.788 --> 02:28:38.780
Oh, my God.
It's the children from the mission.

02:28:38.857 --> 02:28:40.987
The last convoy leaves Darwin
in a matter of minutes.

02:28:40.988 --> 02:28:41.382
Come on!

02:28:41.460 --> 02:28:43.394
- In the truck!
- Come on, boys!

02:28:43.462 --> 02:28:45.487
- To the truck. Follow Brother Frank.
- Truck's waiting. Let's go.

02:28:45.564 --> 02:28:47.293
Follow Brother Frank.
Follow Brother Frank.

02:28:47.366 --> 02:28:49.300
- <i>That's it. That's it.</i>
- Come on, boys. Come on, boys.

02:28:49.368 --> 02:28:51.632
- Let's go.
- <i>Come on, boys.</i>

02:28:51.703 --> 02:28:55.070
<i> Quick as you can to the end of</i>
<i>the wharf, and then straight on the truck.</i>

02:28:55.140 --> 02:28:58.075
- <i>Sarah.</i>
- Ivan!

02:28:58.143 --> 02:29:00.373
Thank you!

02:29:03.882 --> 02:29:06.316
Thank you.

02:29:06.385 --> 02:29:08.785
I shall prepare your bill.

02:29:13.826 --> 02:29:15.851
Where'd you come from?

02:29:15.928 --> 02:29:19.386
The good Lord has delivered us,
but we could do with a ride, Sergeant.

02:29:19.464 --> 02:29:21.830
I'm not Jesus Christ,
but I'll give it my best shot.

02:29:21.900 --> 02:29:23.993
Come on, kids.
Come on. On the trucks.

02:29:24.069 --> 02:29:26.765
<i>I want a third in the front,</i>
<i>a third at the back.</i>

02:29:26.839 --> 02:29:29.740
<i>Come on. Leg 'em up.</i>
<i>They're little fellas. Come on.</i>

02:29:29.808 --> 02:29:32.743
<i>Bring those little fellas up to the front.</i>

02:29:32.811 --> 02:29:35.780
<i>You cursed me, you little creamy.</i>

02:29:35.848 --> 02:29:38.942
Oh. Oh.

02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:44.016
When I said that no one
could get out there...

02:29:44.089 --> 02:29:46.080
<i>I'd forgotten about you, Drover.</i>

02:29:46.158 --> 02:29:50.094
<i>That no matter.</i>
<i>We gonna go back Faraway Downs.</i>

02:29:51.797 --> 02:29:55.062
Yes, he's right. With the water up,
it's the safest place in the north.

02:29:56.134 --> 02:29:58.295
<i>These are, after all-</i>

02:29:58.370 --> 02:30:01.703
Extraordinary circumstances.

02:30:03.275 --> 02:30:06.142
Extraordinary circumstances.

02:30:06.211 --> 02:30:08.805
Thank you, Emmett.

02:30:14.753 --> 02:30:17.221
I'll see you mob in Faraway Downs.

02:30:26.064 --> 02:30:29.932
Here, fellas, make some room
for the kids, will ya?

02:30:30.002 --> 02:30:32.266
- Can you help me, please?
- In you go.

02:30:33.605 --> 02:30:35.766
Right-o! That's it. They're all on.

02:30:35.841 --> 02:30:38.605
Let's get out of here.
Come on. Let's go.

02:30:40.145 --> 02:30:42.636
All right, kids, hold on.

02:30:47.586 --> 02:30:49.781
Mr. Fletcher!

02:30:51.189 --> 02:30:53.180
Mr. Fletcher.

02:30:53.258 --> 02:30:55.419
Neil.

02:30:55.494 --> 02:30:57.325
<i>We gotta go.</i>

02:31:00.332 --> 02:31:03.267
Go and tell Callahan
there's looters everywhere.

02:31:05.003 --> 02:31:08.131
Go and tell Callahan!

02:31:13.912 --> 02:31:17.006
- I've got the keys to the car upstairs.
- Right-o.

02:31:21.186 --> 02:31:23.017
Come on, Mrs. Boss. Hurry up.

02:31:36.134 --> 02:31:37.499
Nullah!

02:31:41.907 --> 02:31:45.536
<i>I got</i> gulapa <i>magic.</i>
<i>No one can hurt me.</i>

02:31:45.610 --> 02:31:47.874
- <i> Nullah! No!</i>
- No!

02:31:55.487 --> 02:31:58.388
<i>No! No!</i>

02:32:09.301 --> 02:32:12.270
Nullah!

02:32:12.337 --> 02:32:15.864
Nullah, you all right, little man?
Nullah, please. Come on. Please.

02:32:17.609 --> 02:32:19.543
Come on.

02:32:21.913 --> 02:32:23.904
There. That's it.

02:32:26.518 --> 02:32:29.214
No bullet. Me <i>gulapa.</i>

02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:06.724
<i>King George teach me...</i>

02:33:06.792 --> 02:33:10.922
<i>the rain will fall,</i>
<i>the grass grow green...</i>

02:33:10.996 --> 02:33:14.659
<i>and life, it begin again.</i>

02:33:20.405 --> 02:33:22.873
Let's go home.

02:33:22.941 --> 02:33:25.000
There's no place like it.

02:34:08.019 --> 02:34:10.715
<i>One thing I know.</i>

02:34:10.789 --> 02:34:14.054
Why <i>we tell story</i>
<i>is the most important of all.</i>

02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:18.627
<i>That's how you keep them people</i>
<i>belong you...</i>

02:34:18.697 --> 02:34:21.257
<i>always.</i>

02:35:10.615 --> 02:35:12.549
Oh.

02:35:27.666 --> 02:35:31.466
Mrs. Boss, I sing you to me.

02:35:58.530 --> 02:36:00.464
Here.

02:36:57.722 --> 02:37:00.316
And I will hear you.

02:38:06.591 --> 02:38:10.459
<i># Sing and I will hear you #</i>

02:38:10.528 --> 02:38:13.554
<i># No matter where you are #</i>

02:38:14.699 --> 02:38:18.635
<i># A song to light the darkest night #</i>

02:38:18.703 --> 02:38:22.605
<i># And guide me from afar#</i>

02:38:22.674 --> 02:38:25.905
<i># And I will never#</i>

02:38:25.977 --> 02:38:29.310
<i># Be afraid #</i>

02:38:29.381 --> 02:38:33.181
<i># Now I know you're somewhere #</i>

02:38:33.251 --> 02:38:36.652
<i># You're everywhere to me #</i>

02:38:39.457 --> 02:38:42.085
<i># The warming of the sun #</i>

02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:47.097
<i># Upon the earth beneath my feet #</i>

02:38:47.165 --> 02:38:50.760
<i># And when the rain falls down #</i>

02:38:50.835 --> 02:38:54.828
<i># You tell the story #</i>

02:38:54.906 --> 02:38:59.275
<i># And I will hear you #</i>

02:38:59.344 --> 02:39:02.472
<i># Always near you #</i>

02:39:02.547 --> 02:39:06.039
<i># By the Boab tree ##</i>

02:39:28.740 --> 02:39:33.302
<i> # From the sunburnt plains</i>
<i>of far-off north Australia #</i>

02:39:34.646 --> 02:39:38.946
<i># Came a fella born to ride</i>
<i>the wide, brown land #</i>

02:39:40.452 --> 02:39:43.250
<i># Oh, he grew up running wild #</i>

02:39:43.321 --> 02:39:46.154
<i># But soon by all was styled #</i>

02:39:46.224 --> 02:39:50.490
<i># As the country's greatest</i>
<i>ever-drovin' man #</i>

02:39:52.096 --> 02:39:56.430
<i># Though his legend rode the winds</i>
<i>from Broome to Darwin #</i>

02:39:57.802 --> 02:40:03.172
<i># They loved and loathed him</i>
<i>right from end to end #</i>

02:40:03.241 --> 02:40:06.074
<i># For when the Drover gave his heart #</i>

02:40:06.144 --> 02:40:08.874
<i># To a girl whose skin was dark #</i>

02:40:08.947 --> 02:40:14.613
<i># From that day on</i>
<i>he was no white man's friend #</i>

02:40:14.686 --> 02:40:17.416
<i># So goes the Drover's story #</i>

02:40:17.489 --> 02:40:20.049
<i># You will hear it near and far #</i>

02:40:20.124 --> 02:40:25.289
<i># And in the end</i>
<i>it's all he'll ever own #</i>

02:40:25.363 --> 02:40:28.491
<i># It says the outcast is a free man #</i>

02:40:28.566 --> 02:40:31.228
<i># lfhe sleeps under the stars #</i>

02:40:31.302 --> 02:40:36.035
<i># Makes the blanket</i>
<i>of the southern skies his home #</i>

02:41:09.774 --> 02:41:15.610
<i># But the Drover is a man</i>
<i>of constant shadows #</i>

02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:20.811
<i># Haunted by his pain</i>
<i>his past and name #</i>

02:41:20.885 --> 02:41:23.945
<i># For every mile he rides #</i>

02:41:24.022 --> 02:41:26.388
<i># What he cannot hide #</i>

02:41:26.457 --> 02:41:28.721
<i># Is the longing in his heart #</i>

02:41:28.793 --> 02:41:31.853
<i># To love again #</i>

02:41:31.930 --> 02:41:34.626
<i># So goes the Drover's story #</i>

02:41:34.699 --> 02:41:37.190
<i># You'll hear it near and far#</i>

02:41:37.268 --> 02:41:42.103
<i># And in the end</i>
<i>it's all he'll ever own #</i>

02:41:42.173 --> 02:41:45.540
<i># It says the outcast is a free man #</i>

02:41:45.610 --> 02:41:48.238
<i># If he sleeps under the stars #</i>

02:41:48.313 --> 02:41:53.307
<i># Makes the blanket</i>
<i>of the southern skies his home #</i>

02:41:56.554 --> 02:42:01.685
<i># And makes the blanket</i>

02:42:04.896 --> 02:42:07.387
<i># His home ##</i>
