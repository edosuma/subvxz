00:36.335 --> 00:38.361
I am the supervisor.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.405
I was originally a human.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.441
I see it all.

00:45.512 --> 00:48.242
Coming from the year 2518.

00:48.281 --> 00:50.306
I can keep track of all sides of the galaxy.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.476
It's 200 years after the rise of the group.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.282
Evidence from genetic experiments.

00:55.321 --> 00:57.289
Evidence of an unknown technology.

00:57.357 --> 01:00.349
Evidence of human DNA
inserted DNA is not known.

01:00.427 --> 01:03.487
Source, the outside world and everything.

01:04.263 --> 01:07.290
Pieces voice believed to be the supervisor.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.336
Evidence about the
supervisor prior to modification.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.464
The discovery that is was
highly sensitive information.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.245
Recording history has risen.

01:19.446 --> 01:22.381
Complex life is rare in the universe.

01:23.383 --> 01:26.352
It is believed that intelligent life begins
on earth.

01:26.419 --> 01:31.413
But I find that advanced technology
more than a million a year earlier.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.287
Creatures of this world,

01:38.331 --> 01:41.357
Master who visited Earth in the past

01:41.434 --> 01:44.301
and accelerate our evolution.

01:48.374 --> 01:51.502
Unfortunately, the human empire rose.

01:52.312 --> 01:54.553
Wise enough to do
space travel.

01:56.349 --> 01:59.409
This is the first foundation of the federation.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.277
The world discovered that the earth

02:02.355 --> 02:07.349
and capable of changing the world
be thousands of copies of the earth.

02:09.395 --> 02:12.330
Unofficially, the machine
intelligence becomes dominant

02:12.365 --> 02:14.424
and we tackle them all.

02:15.401 --> 02:20.361
We fight and we win
at twenty-eight billion lives.

02:21.341 --> 02:24.310
I was born in the midst of this terrible war.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.436
When you can stop it in three million.

02:30.316 --> 02:34.252
Through the blood of a master, I became immortal.

02:34.287 --> 02:38.348
I have been given a vision and I
have found two great federations.

02:39.359 --> 02:42.453
I have chosen my preferred program.

02:43.329 --> 02:47.459
I have made the earth as much force
and some other colonies.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.462
But someone must be responsible for
the future of the human race.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.408
As long as we fix,
restore, and breathing.

02:57.477 --> 03:00.275
Mankind will be back on the victory.

03:00.446 --> 03:03.472
The kindness of the Master has given me
extension of lives.

03:03.516 --> 03:07.384
But now I have to bring myself
for further modification.

03:08.421 --> 03:11.288
If Masters is embedded in my DNA.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.257
I will live and will be returned.

03:13.359 --> 03:17.261
If this fails, it will
take my life experiments.

03:20.500 --> 03:25.494
If I survived, I claimed the throne and
supervisor immortal.

03:26.239 --> 03:28.298
And control the entire galaxy.

03:30.543 --> 03:34.377
Those who oppose me must die.

03:36.382 --> 03:40.318
200 YEARS LATER

03:45.391 --> 03:46.391
Terminus.

03:47.293 --> 03:48.351
The capital of the world.

03:49.262 --> 03:51.253
Great empire has fallen.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.401
I grew up in the twilight of a great empire.

03:57.503 --> 04:00.267
It starts from cleaning the entire
empire crumbling

04:00.373 --> 04:02.432
and construction of something new.

04:03.376 --> 04:06.277
Even as a boy,
I can feel the damage.

04:06.412 --> 04:10.246
Handcuff. Only a matter of time.

04:16.356 --> 04:21.384
We oppose dumb wars
Terranostra this fight.

04:22.295 --> 04:25.230
We asked supervisors galaxy

04:25.298 --> 04:29.325
started to provide funding for the war
and to help its own people.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.368
Puppet federation.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.372
We ask you to think about ...

04:35.475 --> 04:36.475
My father,

04:37.343 --> 04:39.402
Revolutionary famous local,

04:39.479 --> 04:41.470
brave, strong and assertive.

04:42.348 --> 04:46.341
Overnight campaign watchdog agency.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.253
- 18 YEARS LATER.
- This is the beginning of many things.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.446
I survived in 5.3 minutes

04:51.524 --> 04:53.253
I can take the exam.

04:53.526 --> 04:56.290
One chance in a thousand.

05:05.438 --> 05:07.372
Federation rushed.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.305
And those censored.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.502
My dream grows in silence.

05:11.544 --> 05:13.307
Flight lieutenant, Chaplain.

05:13.546 --> 05:15.343
Lt. flight, Worthy.

05:16.516 --> 05:17.516
Worthy?

05:18.484 --> 05:22.318
General, do we know
someone with the name Worthy?

05:23.256 --> 05:25.315
Yes, there are people who do not agree,
I believe.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.419
But he's been killed.

05:27.527 --> 05:28.527
Oh, yes.

05:29.362 --> 05:30.386
There is a relationship?

05:30.463 --> 05:32.397
There is no relationship, the Supreme Commander.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.467
I understand.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.231
Flight lieutenant, Trapper.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.337
Flight lieutenant, Cathrine.

05:42.475 --> 05:45.501
Pilots typically lasts
for 3 minutes in battle.

05:46.245 --> 05:49.305
Jet fighter through federation
as much credit 180000 per year.

05:49.415 --> 05:52.407
If you're crashing and survived,
you're not going to fly anymore.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.420
I hope I said it clearly.

05:57.390 --> 05:58.390
Any one of these?

05:58.491 --> 06:01.483
Oversupply. inventory vessel
got this all.

06:02.261 --> 06:03.261
Is this legal?

06:03.296 --> 06:04.296
Maybe, do not know.

06:04.364 --> 06:08.460
Do you think our riches
should be used for charity?

06:08.501 --> 06:12.301
This concentration of space ...
Space will last for ...

06:12.438 --> 06:13.438
six months.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.374
Wealth is not used for charitable federations.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.340
No, Captain.

06:17.343 --> 06:19.402
By the way, I was promoted.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.344
Flight lieutenant.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.474
- Oh, good.
- Yes, no more misery.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.313
Why did you join the federation?

06:25.328 --> 06:26.328
I want to fly.

06:26.352 --> 06:27.673
- Do you want to fly?
- Yes, Captain.

07:28.481 --> 07:32.349
Hey, are you sure?

07:48.234 --> 07:52.227
Fear, anger becomes a punishment.

07:52.438 --> 07:56.499
Storm clouds gathered, and
The new command will appear soon.

08:10.456 --> 08:13.254
We find something there.

08:13.459 --> 08:18.260
A 2000 years old warehouses.

08:18.331 --> 08:23.291
What do you believe are the descendants
horrible creatures?

08:23.402 --> 08:24.426
His master?

08:24.504 --> 08:27.371
Yes, master.

08:28.307 --> 08:32.243
Everything came together to prove
our relationship with God.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.275
I am the Lord.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.347
Of course you, dear.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.253
- You are the king.
- There are more ...

08:44.457 --> 08:46.516
It is the former warehouse of DNA.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.495
It has been abandoned.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.494
We can take it all.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.787
I'll miss you when you go.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.537
I will.

09:11.350 --> 09:12.476
Terranostra

09:12.518 --> 09:15.385
was sent to prison for the federation.

09:16.255 --> 09:18.416
Controlled by some religious populations

09:18.491 --> 09:20.459
who all love to hate.

09:21.394 --> 09:25.421
You could say there is a cancer that grows
in their rankings.

09:25.498 --> 09:30.333
The new weapon could threaten Terra supervisor
and the evil federation.

09:30.436 --> 09:33.405
It is the prototype of a battle star.

09:33.472 --> 09:37.499
The fastest, emotionless, and rough
in the federation.

09:38.277 --> 09:41.371
Bringing thousands of missile destroyers.

09:41.447 --> 09:46.248
Each missile can destroy
each lives in the world 9.

09:46.352 --> 09:51.483
I, supreme king Terranostra
declared war against the federation

09:51.524 --> 09:53.424
and to keep the peace.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.419
Stay with us.

11:07.299 --> 11:08.391
You'll be safe.

11:09.435 --> 11:10.493
You'll be fine.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.570
We've all experienced it.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.515
Earth.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.342
A set of radiation.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.418
Battle wounds.

11:26.452 --> 11:30.354
The ghosts of our ancestors still
haunt this hallowed ground.

11:54.346 --> 11:56.371
Terranostra plane surface.

11:56.415 --> 11:57.279
Tumbangkan them.

11:57.316 --> 11:58.248
Aye, Captain.

11:58.284 --> 12:00.525
All hands prepare for battle.
Maximum shielding.

12:05.357 --> 12:07.325
Oh, no, no, no.
Not now.

12:09.295 --> 12:11.525
Arms control, filling
battery on the target machine.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.423
Weapons loaded, locked, Captain.

12:16.335 --> 12:17.335
- Locked.
- Shoot!

12:32.485 --> 12:35.318
- Two more came around, Captain.
- They saw it.

12:35.354 --> 12:37.254
Captain, I recommend not involved.

12:37.289 --> 12:39.809
- Shielding electro unstable.
- If so, make it stable.

12:43.362 --> 12:45.296
Lost his shield, Captain.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.425
If you want to shield,
I recommend ...

12:47.466 --> 12:49.366
- 3 missiles again.
- Take a shot.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.268
Pilot, 28000 miles and comes around ...

12:56.542 --> 12:58.442
Communication dead.

12:58.511 --> 12:59.511
Are the missiles ready?

13:00.312 --> 13:01.312
Briefly.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.373
The weapon is ready.

13:04.483 --> 13:05.483
Come around.

13:05.484 --> 13:08.419
Turbo at 76.28 on 79.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.284
- Aye, Captain. 79.
- Shoot!

13:22.301 --> 13:24.360
Oh, no. No. No.

13:36.382 --> 13:37.382
Good job.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.438
You deserve it.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.307
Thank you.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.336
We need to talk later.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.346
About us?

14:12.251 --> 14:13.445
It was always about us.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.416
We are under the federation.

14:32.438 --> 14:34.429
Leave us.

14:37.343 --> 14:40.471
How many men did you kill?

14:41.447 --> 14:43.312
6o.

14:43.449 --> 14:48.352
I would give sufficient numbers.
I want you to play in this operation.

14:49.288 --> 14:50.482
Justice.

14:51.257 --> 14:55.489
- Remove the rope.
- Fuck you!

15:03.302 --> 15:06.294
Very good, suffered in the violence.

15:11.343 --> 15:15.245
- Execution you will be suffering.
- We will rise up.

15:20.419 --> 15:23.252
Fuck, rebellion come!

15:29.395 --> 15:33.229
There is no fight pilots
who was on the bridge with you.

15:33.299 --> 15:35.290
Yes, the captain.
Watch and learn, captain.

15:35.401 --> 15:37.369
Ah ..

15:39.405 --> 15:43.364
Remember all the people. You are
man in the service of ..

15:43.475 --> 15:48.276
You are an important part of the machine
known by the federation.

15:48.347 --> 15:51.475
If one of us Flater.
We all Flater.

15:51.517 --> 15:56.477
Our first mission as an battleship crew 1,
is visited Earth long.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.484
Stupid name for a planet.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.437
- Did you take the antibiotic pills I?
- Not.

16:20.512 --> 16:23.242
- Do you want one?
- I do not need.

17:15.401 --> 17:19.359
Protective layer on the ship early aktivasikan.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.473
Take expert.

17:25.344 --> 17:30.372
No. All existing robot
The core will pull the federation.

17:30.449 --> 17:33.509
100 tax, we become slaves federation.

17:34.353 --> 17:36.793
And you say this with guns blazing
leads to us.

17:37.256 --> 17:41.352
We watched a bit of disagreement
you're up there. Weapon without a protector,

17:41.460 --> 17:43.291
- There is no communication.
- Hi, honey. You do not realize ...

17:43.328 --> 17:46.388
They will shoot on the planet
This, as we were in the service.

17:47.533 --> 17:50.331
Crummy became a federation.

17:50.436 --> 17:54.429
Hi, dear, you're not aware they would shoot
on this planet as we are still in service.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.371
Re-connected remote communication.

17:56.475 --> 17:58.306
Get the bastard back here.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.277
- Yes, sir.
- Put me to the General Gustav.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.438
I think we are pursuing Teronosta.

18:05.284 --> 18:08.219
Do you really want to question me,
General?

18:08.353 --> 18:10.233
I know, but we should have a definition ..

18:10.289 --> 18:12.484
Mother's disappointment. Order has been
so steeped in history.

18:16.361 --> 18:19.330
Following command. Supreme commander.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.457
Nice. Disbanded.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.267
Between putting yourself
under federal regulations ...

18:26.405 --> 18:32.344
Or forced to eat meat and drink tiruanmu
artificial food using mind control.

18:32.411 --> 18:34.311
We have to go.
I'm so sorry.

18:53.365 --> 18:58.359
Tell a civilian mechanic was that their lives will
lost if he could not get rid of protector.

18:58.437 --> 19:00.302
- Yes, the captain.
- Tim lander deck.

19:00.405 --> 19:03.397
Parameters of about 10,000 km,
safe distance.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.377
At the climax 2.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.286
- I do not like this job.
- You are both to the bridge now.

19:15.387 --> 19:17.252
Yes, we know. We know.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.449
- Where did you go?
- I obey. Get out of my way!

19:19.525 --> 19:23.427
- You fucking whore!
- Fuck you, dirt toilet.

19:25.364 --> 19:27.457
Asshole!

19:34.473 --> 19:36.441
Please.

19:39.344 --> 19:42.336
I've been consulting directly
with the high command.

19:42.447 --> 19:47.350
Order to be removed, in charge
conspiracy with Teronosta.

19:47.419 --> 19:50.479
Provide them with
robot class 4.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.487
- Do you understand the command, captain?
- Understand, general.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.228
- Negotiation failed.
- They want to shoot the ship.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.357
Reamer, Reamer!

20:01.433 --> 20:03.401
Climax 2. At the target and ready.

20:04.436 --> 20:07.303
Target. Earth.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.341
- What we have to do it again?
- Doubt me anymore, warrior Togras.

20:10.442 --> 20:11.500
Yes, captain!

20:21.253 --> 20:24.279
- Got a problem locking ...
- Do it.

20:41.273 --> 20:43.241
What a damn?

20:43.342 --> 20:45.469
The command delay, abort!

20:46.278 --> 20:48.303
Marta! I will protect you!

20:48.380 --> 20:51.247
- Are you fucking Muni?
- Worty?

20:51.316 --> 20:57.448
- You take the oath of legium.
- Did you know legium will lock out the air?

20:57.522 --> 20:59.353
Do it!

21:08.533 --> 21:10.467
Vehicles approaching!

21:18.477 --> 21:21.344
Defense guns connected.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.243
Shoot!

21:27.319 --> 21:29.253
Fucking asshole!

21:29.521 --> 21:32.285
Let's drop this bird!

21:37.496 --> 21:41.398
I supreme commander warship, we
fought with Muni Teronosta!

21:42.267 --> 21:43.393
We do not Teronosta!

21:43.468 --> 21:46.335
Bring to the atmosphere,
their weapons will be damaged.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.303
It was a bad idea.

21:49.374 --> 21:50.500
- Do it!
- Not!

21:51.310 --> 21:54.302
I fly a better ship.

21:55.514 --> 21:58.312
- I'm getting one.
- Stay focused.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.495
Do not shoot, do not shoot!
My bullet discharged.

22:23.408 --> 22:27.344
I'm with you. Command on the right side.

22:27.379 --> 22:28.505
Back to the engine room.

22:43.462 --> 22:46.397
- Fall!
- Marta, skip Tetoren!

22:46.465 --> 22:48.228
- I will ..
- Use the maneuvering process.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.393
- Not an option!
- Tell me!

22:50.502 --> 22:52.333
We're going to hit!

22:52.504 --> 22:54.267
Escape pod!

22:54.339 --> 22:55.465
- There is only one self-rescuer pod!
- That's it?

22:56.241 --> 22:57.367
We are prototypes.

22:58.276 --> 23:02.474
Glacial tactics. If we turn the gas from
machines and we use blow slowed.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.447
- It will blow up the ship.
- Not in this speed.

23:04.483 --> 23:07.316
- The window will explode in touch.
- Do it, Torgass as claimed.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.411
I hope you're better Munti planet!

23:10.489 --> 23:13.322
Take one to silver!

23:13.492 --> 23:15.289
Silver one another.

23:17.496 --> 23:19.487
Do that, to the bridge.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.301
Jason!

23:27.539 --> 23:29.473
- It worked!
- It does not work!

23:30.275 --> 23:32.243
Bring another puff.
Preparing to blow!

23:32.310 --> 23:33.470
You're a fucking idiot!

23:43.321 --> 23:48.315
You want motivated people into war?
Give them a reason to fight!

23:48.393 --> 23:51.260
Feed their anger.

23:52.464 --> 23:56.457

We need permission to go.

23:57.235 --> 24:00.261

24:06.311 --> 24:10.475
- The ship will never fly again.
- Oh, he's strong, dear. He will fly.

24:11.316 --> 24:13.307
After some repairs.

24:13.385 --> 24:17.481
- Continue to build better ships.
- That the tax dollars of hard work, it's there.

24:25.430 --> 24:30.333
All federal departments are already in execution
sabagai called the exclusion of Terra Nostar.

24:30.402 --> 24:33.682
It is estimated at least 30 women
already in execution in the underground network.

24:34.339 --> 24:37.274
Denied by the government in the civil war
the damage on the road.

24:37.409 --> 24:41.470
Expected that high consultant Terra Nostar
will make a formal conference against the federation.

24:41.546 --> 24:44.515
In a few hours, the question
was where the protectors?

24:45.283 --> 24:47.251
And why is the government silent?

24:47.352 --> 24:51.311
Missionary, I need now to
Bring in the population.

24:51.423 --> 24:55.484
And they like a declaration of war,
we will have the first win.

24:56.294 --> 25:01.254
With a large army of Terra Nostar.
Calista 2 already fallen.

25:01.466 --> 25:05.402
Missionary, I need now to
bring justice in the republic's population.

25:05.537 --> 25:08.404

25:52.450 --> 25:56.318
- What is it?
- Calista 2.

25:56.488 --> 25:58.353
Oh my god.

25:58.523 --> 26:01.253

26:01.459 --> 26:04.223
And many others.

26:06.464 --> 26:09.399
I fully grieve.

26:14.539 --> 26:18.305
I met Terra agent Nostar
The warship 1.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.437
Yes.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.438
That's why I'm here, General.

26:31.523 --> 26:34.390
TERRA NOSTAR
HARBOR FREIGHT

26:43.234 --> 26:45.498
Greetings ladies.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.510
I never expected this.

26:56.381 --> 26:59.441
We have an order that the warship
already included in the issue.

26:59.517 --> 27:02.418
- Terra Nostar?
- We do not know.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.422
We lost contact of them.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.480
You give us the name?

27:09.394 --> 27:12.363
Which one of you is Ustobor?

27:16.334 --> 27:18.325
He was gone yesterday.

27:19.237 --> 27:22.400
We have 528 legium ready for action
but none of them lead.

27:36.388 --> 27:40.415
You know what it's worth, we sell
missile climax, and we buy boats rover.

27:40.525 --> 27:43.255
No, we can not allow missile

27:54.272 --> 27:55.296
You got it?

27:55.373 --> 27:58.240
Yes, I had trouble last week.

27:58.476 --> 28:01.502
If the power back, it
fine. One other thing.

28:06.384 --> 28:07.442
Where is he, captain?

28:08.286 --> 28:10.311
He was already dead.

28:11.289 --> 28:12.449
This is for 4 days.

28:13.291 --> 28:16.351
You're already discussing it.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.266
Do you need help ...

28:36.247 --> 28:37.509
And ...

28:53.531 --> 28:56.364
He has been born again.

28:58.336 --> 29:00.395
First 3 years, I do not want him.

29:02.407 --> 29:05.274
I told you to love him.

29:05.510 --> 29:08.479
I could not breathe with the weight,
without the breakup.

29:13.351 --> 29:16.514
Already paid your son's life.

29:20.258 --> 29:23.421
There is no guarantee ...

29:24.395 --> 29:30.334
In death.

29:30.535 --> 29:33.402
In death.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.554
We do this because of one thing.

29:38.409 --> 29:41.276
- Okay ...
- You join the rebellion.

29:42.514 --> 29:43.514
What rebellion?

29:45.350 --> 29:46.471
I have to show you.

29:46.518 --> 29:50.249
- No, we can not discuss ...
- Jolli.

29:51.356 --> 29:52.414
Come here.

29:57.428 --> 30:02.525
So, he lived here, with a special weapon
for all classes.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.496
Some are already emerging.

30:07.539 --> 30:12.499

- Federation had a period of 200 million people.

30:13.344 --> 30:16.438

- You guys, it's nothing, but it is not like that.

30:21.553 --> 30:24.454
Young man, I appreciate your idealism.

30:25.423 --> 30:28.483
But you can feel it all.

30:35.433 --> 30:36.457
Only 2 sides again.

30:37.235 --> 30:39.203

30:39.404 --> 30:41.372
The same size as you.

30:41.506 --> 30:44.498
Engaged in a different way.

30:45.376 --> 30:48.504
You have the energy of existing federation.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.347

31:00.291 --> 31:02.486
We want to see this.

31:04.262 --> 31:08.494

31:14.539 --> 31:17.303
We need young leaders to control
that.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.339
Are you prepared?

31:20.311 --> 31:21.505
This situation started for you.

My name is John.

31:48.373 --> 31:51.308

31:56.414 --> 31:59.247
The Federation has moved.

31:59.417 --> 32:00.538
How do you know that kid?

32:01.252 --> 32:02.514
So who knows?

32:05.423 --> 32:09.291
Mother, not like that, I'm fine.

32:10.428 --> 32:11.628

32:16.467 --> 32:20.403
Look, it comes from there, and the police

34:28.299 --> 34:32.257
He will be the biggest asset in your life.

34:33.304 --> 34:34.464
He had to stop it.

34:35.473 --> 34:36.496
I'm not fine.

34:37.408 --> 34:42.311
You have to move past the target

34:44.415 --> 34:45.415
It is better for you.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.572

34:50.254 --> 34:51.516
What are you doing?

34:52.489 --> 34:55.458

34:56.393 --> 35:00.228
Move there.

35:00.398 --> 35:02.298

Give me, I could hack it.

36:36.294 --> 36:42.324
You know a component like this?

42:42.293 --> 42:43.351
Hit me!

42:43.494 --> 42:45.359
No.

42:49.466 --> 42:54.233
I think the overseer prohibit
family members or relationships among personnel.

42:54.438 --> 42:57.498
[LAUGHS] Well, overseer did not see.

42:58.275 --> 43:00.243
Code affect the overseer.

43:02.346 --> 43:03.404
[SCREAMING]

43:06.483 --> 43:09.384
Anyway, after all ...

43:10.287 --> 43:11.608
Who sent us to the SEALs?

43:36.413 --> 43:38.347
Hello sir.

43:39.283 --> 43:42.275
- Who are you?
- We are a gift from the main office.

43:42.353 --> 43:43.411
You're a virgin, huh?

43:43.520 --> 43:45.488
Yes. We virgin.

43:47.291 --> 43:48.451
Bastard.

43:52.529 --> 43:54.224
You know how to fly?

43:54.431 --> 43:55.489
No.

44:21.458 --> 44:25.292
- I Roartak.
- Code 371 992.

44:26.363 --> 44:28.388
I accept it, I'm glad you're safe.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.527
You're man-made.

44:32.536 --> 44:37.530
Nice to meet you,
I can smell your machine.

44:39.410 --> 44:41.310
I think you can trust him.

44:42.413 --> 44:44.438
You have a woman's artificial?

44:44.481 --> 44:49.248
I was banned from creating creatures
smarter and more powerful than myself.

44:50.254 --> 44:52.245
But he's got his own advantage.

44:52.423 --> 44:55.463
I'm not prone to emotional abuse
or jealousy is not important.

45:03.534 --> 45:05.263
You do not like to fly?

45:12.242 --> 45:18.340
Well, since we are talking
I'll tell theory konspirasiku

45:18.415 --> 45:19.415
about Pope high.

45:21.251 --> 45:23.242
Are you serious?

45:23.320 --> 45:24.412
It was good.

45:26.256 --> 45:27.280
Okay.

45:28.358 --> 45:29.679
There detrenium along the way.

45:30.294 --> 45:33.354
Artificial intelligence that you use,
is there any intellectual limitations?

45:34.331 --> 45:35.811
I'd rather not talk about it.

45:36.300 --> 45:38.325
We're somewhere in the system Pomares right?

45:38.535 --> 45:41.231
One small asteroids.

45:49.346 --> 45:50.346
Do not anybody move!

45:52.382 --> 45:54.543
General Gustav if you can take it ...
[SCREAMING]

45:55.486 --> 45:58.421
I'm going to burn him with a semi-automatic pistol
12mm high-power!

45:58.489 --> 46:00.457
Not!

46:01.425 --> 46:03.290
Staris.

46:03.393 --> 46:09.423
I fulfill my vows to the Federation
you fucking traitor!

46:16.540 --> 46:18.405
Send him back to Germanis.

46:27.384 --> 46:29.352
Disgusting bitch.

46:35.459 --> 46:39.486
Fuck you and the group terorismu
sad!

46:39.530 --> 46:43.364
You will find P3K in compartment
left, goodbye.

47:03.287 --> 47:05.414
- Very good.
- I need your opinion.

47:08.525 --> 47:10.459
Yes, this is one of us.

47:12.496 --> 47:14.396
The protocol has been modified.

47:14.498 --> 47:16.779
I found spying here
a few weeks ago.

47:20.270 --> 47:21.270
Can I keep it?

47:22.439 --> 47:24.407
I still have two more.

47:25.442 --> 47:27.376
You're making me nervous.

47:32.449 --> 47:33.507
What is it?

47:35.485 --> 47:37.385
Nothing involving you.

47:39.423 --> 47:41.323
I've never landed before.

47:41.491 --> 47:44.289
- Yes.
- You're not nervous, right?

47:46.296 --> 47:47.296
I've definitely nervous.

47:48.365 --> 47:50.265
The worst pilot I've ever seen.

47:56.306 --> 47:58.274
I know what you're gonna say,
I'll get right to work.

47:58.408 --> 48:00.273
Who do you side with?

48:00.310 --> 48:04.246
Oh, general very good to me.

48:05.282 --> 48:10.345
I remember when you were a baby,
I see you're almost like a dead silence.

48:11.455 --> 48:14.447
I can read through your eyes
to reveal your soul to me.

48:15.392 --> 48:17.360
You can not hide anything from me.

48:17.427 --> 48:20.362
As soon as you're done, come back.

48:22.332 --> 48:23.332
Understandable.

48:23.333 --> 48:25.460
My artificial humans will look for you.

48:26.436 --> 48:31.237
Chaos brought confusion,
able to occupy the impending war.

48:31.308 --> 48:33.276
It will be over soon dear.

48:33.510 --> 48:37.503
As soon as the starter in hand,
back to Dominic.

48:38.382 --> 48:40.373
I'm surprised you guys are still intact
after landing it.

48:40.450 --> 48:43.510
This is Diana and I Terina. Hai.

48:44.321 --> 48:45.561
They are all ready for you.

48:46.323 --> 48:49.292
Yes ladies. You may break,
boss in town for a business.

48:53.497 --> 48:54.521
Sword huh?

48:55.299 --> 48:56.357
Aha.

48:58.535 --> 49:02.301
PRIME GRUDA
WORLD unmapped: WEST outer ring.

49:08.345 --> 49:12.372
Robot 2 has completed scanning,
DNA in the sector.

49:12.516 --> 49:15.314
Make sure nothing is disturbed.

49:15.485 --> 49:17.453
What is left should stay that way.

49:17.521 --> 49:20.285
Yes sir, overseer. We understand.

49:25.329 --> 49:27.422
D robot control work.

49:28.398 --> 49:29.456
What did he test?

49:31.501 --> 49:35.301
Investigate evidence of their location.
Do they live.

49:38.275 --> 49:40.155
Maybe they just moved to another planet.

49:40.310 --> 49:44.337
I have given the order to move
remaining goods to the ark.

49:45.315 --> 49:49.411
No one shall be woken,
done with great care.

49:51.521 --> 49:54.388
POL MARIS MONTH NOT LISTED

50:10.507 --> 50:15.240
Federation could use the system
the electric shield ridiculous.

50:16.246 --> 50:17.966
I know all the shields are the best.

50:18.448 --> 50:19.448
Do you agree dear?

50:20.283 --> 50:21.511
Fuck you.

50:22.285 --> 50:25.379
Set trajectory towards earth.
There are soldiers we have to wake up.

50:34.464 --> 50:35.522
- Music?
- Hey.

50:37.234 --> 50:40.294
Complicated encryption, surely the secret word
valuable to be stored.

50:41.271 --> 50:44.263
We know they are looking for some kind of DNA decoder.

50:44.541 --> 50:45.622
It should be relatively easy.

50:46.443 --> 50:50.436
It is more complicated than a simple thread,
The 12 zetabit.

50:50.514 --> 50:53.278
Wow.

50:53.350 --> 50:58.413
I will create a tracking alert
so he returned to the source

50:58.488 --> 51:00.353
and we can see what they are looking for.

51:01.458 --> 51:02.458
[ALARM BLARING]

51:03.393 --> 51:04.994
Sounds like they've arrived.

51:34.357 --> 51:36.325
- They were in a hurry but they sure ...
- What?

51:36.393 --> 51:39.385
Total destruction of all major cities
with radiation bomb.

51:40.263 --> 51:42.390
- Not.
- I'm sorry.

51:42.466 --> 51:45.401
In fact the whole army in the mountains
waiting to be activated.

51:48.438 --> 51:50.497
John Worthy?

51:52.342 --> 51:53.342
Do you know me?

51:53.410 --> 51:55.275
The whole galaxy shipper.

51:56.490 --> 51:57.490
Oh yes.

51:57.514 --> 52:02.281
Diana charge of 500 and 28 legions
in Teranostra.

52:02.419 --> 52:06.480
We are authorized for the robot wars purchased
and paid by insurgents.

52:08.492 --> 52:09.492
I understand.

52:09.526 --> 52:12.256
You take care of the federation and we will
Teranostra care of.

52:32.349 --> 52:33.349
Where have you been?

52:34.284 --> 52:36.644
He was on earth, why we have not met
he or intercept?

52:37.287 --> 52:38.807
I know I've got a plan, calm down.

52:39.256 --> 52:40.245
Oh really you have a plan?

52:40.290 --> 52:43.316
- I have a special vehicle.
- I'm sick of the damn plan

52:43.393 --> 52:45.361
- I need results.
- Terina calm.

52:45.462 --> 52:47.430
- Everything is under control.
- Do not touch me or

52:47.497 --> 52:49.362
I'll send someone to shoot.

52:49.432 --> 52:51.229
You understand Gustav?

52:51.501 --> 52:55.232
Give me a chance,
You have to trust me.

53:20.363 --> 53:24.322
The rest of the fleet ... has been intercepted.

53:27.370 --> 53:28.496
Jolli.

53:47.290 --> 53:48.382
I do not feel anything.

53:52.529 --> 53:54.360
This is not my own anymore.

54:04.341 --> 54:05.399
Let's make them suffer.

54:34.471 --> 54:38.237
[BEEP] General.
Courier plane has arrived.

54:39.276 --> 54:41.267
Nice. You know what to do.

55:04.367 --> 55:05.367
How much?

55:06.369 --> 55:08.337
30 aircraft, probably more.

55:09.372 --> 55:11.431
- Arm missiles.
- Messages entered.

55:14.244 --> 55:15.370
Did he answer?

55:16.279 --> 55:17.840
- Not. I just expect it.
- Jatlus.

55:18.315 --> 55:20.215
- Lieutenant flight.
- I'm the captain.

55:20.417 --> 55:21.417
Bring them here.

55:23.386 --> 55:26.287
- What are you ...?
- Mom and sister would die

55:26.356 --> 55:29.416
one by one unless you surrender
plane of the star.

55:29.459 --> 55:30.483
Wow, wow, wow.

55:31.261 --> 55:33.491
Give it up, there's no time
for discussion!

55:34.264 --> 55:35.458
Work bagusjenderal.

55:37.267 --> 55:38.291
How do I do the swap?

55:38.335 --> 55:40.394
Submit yourself and your family will be released.

55:41.338 --> 55:43.465
And you will be arrested.

55:47.277 --> 55:49.302
Syaratku as follows ...

55:52.282 --> 55:53.442
Not!

55:54.284 --> 55:57.219
Not!
Fuck you!

55:57.520 --> 56:00.489
Not!

56:01.324 --> 56:02.348
It was his friend.

56:03.393 --> 56:07.261
How does it feel, motherfucker?
How does it feel?

56:10.500 --> 56:12.229
No.

56:17.340 --> 56:19.433
Signus Alpha neutral zone.

56:20.543 --> 56:24.411
Need to turn, just one ship.

56:24.547 --> 56:29.246
There are games, we started shooting
each federation that pass us.

56:43.366 --> 56:46.233
We have enough gun,
we will not need a knife collection.

56:47.270 --> 56:50.398
- The gun is the weapon of cowards.
- We'll see.

56:50.473 --> 56:55.376
Make sure the protocol is in turn the robot arms.
Supplies are limited gun.

57:16.266 --> 57:19.326
DNA began to make replekasi.

57:19.469 --> 57:23.405
Tiberius, you've become a good friend.

57:26.309 --> 57:27.469
But I do not believe you.

57:37.320 --> 57:38.446
Rise.

57:42.525 --> 57:44.356
Tiberius?

57:44.427 --> 57:48.363
- Yes, my lord.
- Throw yourself there.

57:48.498 --> 57:50.295
Yes, my lord.

58:03.480 --> 58:04.480
Nice.

58:09.252 --> 58:11.311
I told you, it worked.
I never doubted it.

58:11.387 --> 58:15.289
I do not believe,
I set foot into this planet.

58:22.365 --> 58:24.390
Legion is ready, give words.

58:28.304 --> 58:29.396
The word has been given.

58:32.542 --> 58:36.444
Each of you will bring
a platoon and assigned its own sector.

58:37.280 --> 58:39.407
23:00 Saatjam we attack.

58:40.250 --> 58:44.243
Stay away from the front row,
the territorial unity of the class.

58:44.320 --> 58:48.381
We fought side by side with you
to each stud Teranus dead.

58:52.328 --> 58:53.454
We're membuatjebakan.

58:56.332 --> 58:59.460
- Where the star ship?
- It could be under us, we do not even know.

59:01.371 --> 59:02.429
I do not like this.

59:09.312 --> 59:11.507
We use this planet
Cornasus robot to try.

59:12.348 --> 59:14.509
- It was a bold move but ...
- An attack.

59:27.297 --> 59:29.492
Come on, do not remain hidden.
Where's the fun?

59:30.266 --> 59:31.460
Get rid of her.

59:37.307 --> 59:38.331
Come on.

59:39.275 --> 59:42.369
How are you?
I'm embarrassed we serve in the same flag.

59:42.445 --> 59:45.312
- Trenosus bastard.
- I'm not Trenosus.

59:45.348 --> 59:46.440
Of course, you were.

59:51.421 --> 59:52.513
A nice diversion.

59:53.456 --> 59:54.480
Let's move.

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:09.294
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:14.309
Get down.

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:17.470
No. Not! Star Ship!

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:19.481
- Do not move at all.
- Star Ship!

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:21.382
Do not do it! Do not do it!

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:26.255
- Damn!
- Not!

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.450
- Come on, Whorty. Take it!
- I can not, sir!

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.485
Fuck you!

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:37.358
- No, no! Do not follow!
- I will hunt you down! I'll kill you!

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.271
Not! Out, Jolli!

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:59.412
- It should not do like that.
- All this is just a trap.

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:01.353
There's nothing we can do.

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:03.450
Wait, wait.

01:01:09.532 --> 01:01:13.366
Aolist 14 Umbra.
Help needed at the meeting point.

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.237
Damn!

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:33.514
Come on, let's go.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:50.337
- Let's kill the bastard.
- Hey, do not be too hasty.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.238
Damn, the northern part.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:59.413
Hidden inside! Move, move, move!

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:09.451
All units to the west, enable snuper cel.

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:14.261
- That whole kompani.
- Come on, go! Go, go, go!

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:48.454
- I do not like this.
- Get used.

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:51.298
- More high.
- You need help.

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:53.495
- No, I do not need.
- Ten enemy came.

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:57.238
We move away from the storm.
Prepare weapons and keys.

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:59.793
- Like this?
- You keep doing that, the system will burn.

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:08.507
General, we've got 20 friget, 12 bombs,
2 gravermet and 1 as a bio weapon inventory.

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:11.379
Began to bomb after us away from here.

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.354
General, we can not lock from this distance.

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:16.516
- Refer to the circular, do.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.521
- Wrap, shoot immediately.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:29.335
- 20 ready to do so.
- Not in this altitude.

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:31.397
- We're headed to the eye of the storm.
- Perfect.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.431
- Are you crazy?
- Yes, I'm crazy.

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:46.287
Against the wind,
Do not fight the wind.

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:47.449
- It's an idea?
- Trust me.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.288
We do not do this,
not in the star ship.

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:58.231
- Pressure at 20 PSI.
- Stay with him.

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:01.336
- He's emotional, he will make mistakes.
- Yes, General.

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:07.342
- Too fast!
- Drive the storm!

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:09.435
You're stupid, Whorty. This is not ...

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.338
Start shooting!

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.254
Damn!

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:23.257
We are going to explode!

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.261
- Faster!
- Not!

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:28.456
- We can do it!
- Up to the top, 20 degrees.

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:30.465
Eliminate driving levels!

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:35.429
All right, all right! Pull ride!

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:37.272
Pull us out of here!

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.340
Pilot.

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:39.441
Shit.

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:53.354
When we pull up to 28,000 rise.
Use the momentum to escape.

01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:55.517
- Damn, Whorty.
- It's a stupid idea.

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:22.474
- It works!
- You're in luck.

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:26.249
- To the penyelamatanku place.
- Now a street fighter.

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:27.322
Let's do it.

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:54.278
We will not go into the silver speed immediately.

01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:55.284
What are they?

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:59.311
Part shield generator,
we are trapped in a gravitational field!

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:47.497
All units to the palace.
Meet us at the meeting point.

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:50.329
- Do not ...
- We were attacked!

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:53.274
Let's go!

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:11.223
Okay, okay, okay.

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:14.420
Drayson, how waves of heat shield?

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:16.328
Calvin 70,000 degrees.

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:19.527
- And the federation ship?
- Maybe 3000 but the ship commander is 6.

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:22.362
- What is the distance to the missile?
- Understand, I know you're going.

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:25.238
- What is it?
- Six to 15,000.

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:27.242
- If we are at the end of the explosion?
- True.

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:28.470
- Or we will die.
- Do it.

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:31.241
- Yes, the captain.
- Yes, the captain.

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:37.247
- Tell me about the missiles.
- It's ready.

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:39.254
- Launch.
- He will not pull back.

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:40.321
No.

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:49.321
- How long?
- 30 seconds.

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:51.265
The gravity and the star.

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:54.236
Rotating, wait until the shock wave.
And dive in between them.

01:07:54.303 --> 01:07:55.497
- The shock wave.
- Damn!

01:07:55.538 --> 01:07:57.369
- Shield!
- Do it!

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:03.244
Not!

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.476
Glad to know you.

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:16.322
Drayson, turn off the power!

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:28.359
- Know 1.2 is ready.
- Understand.

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:31.237
I need a robot again
for diversion at the east gate.

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:32.433
So Diana could bring in his team.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:36.309
Well, we will immediately provide it.

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:47.345
I've never been this close
with death over the years.

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:50.323
- Do you feel old?
- One day.

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:52.393
Alright. Reset manually.

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:58.491
Okay, limonal super dead.

01:08:59.268 --> 01:09:00.548
Pusher switcher is gone.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:03.328
Weapons are not active.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:05.497
Well, the good news,
food service is still functioning.

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:08.237
So basically we are wretched.

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:10.711
- Maybe it could be worse.
- True.

01:09:11.346 --> 01:09:12.346
Captain!

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:29.397
Keep moving.

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:31.261
Section E to the west wing.

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:33.292
Section seven?

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:46.381
What is it?

01:09:53.488 --> 01:09:56.287
Diana. You're coming of the enemy.

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:58.225
Get out! Get out!

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:00.328
We have already entered!

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:05.425
Not!

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:31.289
- They suck a lot of power.
- Gosh.

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:35.321
Deck 3 and 4 were damaged, need
your orders to abandon ship.

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:36.296
Reject.

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:39.426
- A critical reactor.
- Keep firing!

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:47.304
Oh, we are screwed!

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:52.414
Keep moving, leave the corridor.

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:54.473
Terina.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:10:59.380
I can handle it.
Do not interfere.

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.446
Whatever you say,
where the program?

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:05.324
- In the world.
- Of course.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.289
Drayson, trash anything would be good.

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:12.533
- Restock safety assistance.
- Torgus, online.

01:11:12.534 --> 01:11:16.265
- Rapid speed.
- You must be kidding!

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:22.477
Look out.

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:27.305
- To the way out!
- I've been gone!

01:11:40.529 --> 01:11:42.326
Shit.

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:44.492
- Leave the boat!
- Leave the boat!

01:11:44.533 --> 01:11:46.330
Damn!

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:51.397
I'll give your old model.

01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:54.374
Trish!

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:03.315
Where lighting?

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:06.378
- Give me the light!
- Respiratory.

01:12:06.422 --> 01:12:09.255
- Can be, I'll be right there.
- Respiratory.

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:11.316
- Where?
- Where respirator?

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.386
- Respiratory.
- Here!

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:19.501
Gosh!

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:26.236
- Drayson, no!
- We do not have time.

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:29.335
It's my fault, Joey. It's my fault.

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:31.470
Not!

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:35.314
We have to go! we
have to go now!

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:38.252
Torgus, come on!

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:40.278
We have to go.

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:46.427
Torgus, I need you
waiting for my 15 minutes.

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:48.293
- Terry!
- Just do it!

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:50.397
Get a life!

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.467
We can not win in a fight jet.

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:55.368
I would go to another ship
to steal the rescue boats.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.464
- But ...
- Hey, you said 15 minutes, is not it?

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:02.274
It was already finished.

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:04.412
Save this.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.289
Gosh, what if
they send a missile here?

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:16.348
And you guys making out.

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:19.453
Hey, come on man! Moving!

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:21.491
Moving!

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:23.524
Two.

01:13:24.266 --> 01:13:25.506
You're going to do it, do it!

01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:29.269
Go, go!

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:33.338
Go!

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.245
Come on, let's move!

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:48.388
The police will come,
he will not succeed.

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:51.291
- He gets 5 minutes.
- We need to get out of here!

01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:05.430
I bet you're not scared.

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:05.365
- Hey, orders for ...
- Where the Shadow Gustav?

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.270
You're not going to kill me?

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:10.858
Not if you take me to them.

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:13.500
He headed to the exit on the 2nd floor.

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:16.409
Out of the ship, it would explode!

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:18.310
- Go!
- I'm going!

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:29.347
I said transponder has authority.

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:31.450
You will be the first picked.

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:36.227
- Wait! Gustav, wait!
- I'll keep everything in my boat.

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:38.399
Everything.

01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:41.360
Gustav, wait!

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:46.273
I never betrayed you, is not it?

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:48.306
Never!

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:08.395

I never betrayed my country!

01:16:55.277 --> 01:17:00.340
You're just fanatics. I killed
millions in the name of thy Lord!

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:04.318
My son is dead! Because your people!

I now Teranosa!

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:20.231
I will make you suffer!
Since making my family bleed.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:26.464
I may return to you, your family!

01:17:39.521 --> 01:17:41.489
Your family is still alive.

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:45.454
- Someone track down the woman and her ...
- My family!

01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:48.491
Are you a robot?

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:51.397
We have no record of you going.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.300
Why?

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:19.351

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:25.295
I thought you were better.

01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:57.492
We got detention, originating from Termanus.

01:18:57.532 --> 01:19:00.467
Understandable.

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:03.471
He will surely be executed.

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:08.232
We go.

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:16.512
I have control.

Admitted.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.418
Do it.

I'm a traitor, animals
savage of Terenostra.

You have a wife and children.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:40.238
We gave up, what
remaining in our military ...

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:46.344
- To the resistance.
- Say it.

Where are we?

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:29.313
That's just politics.

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:32.383
How do we save the Worthy?

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:35.295
He will be executed later in the morning, is not it?

01:20:36.431 --> 01:20:38.399
Yes.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.492

This trip, it was great.

01:20:43.538 --> 01:20:45.369

Nice.

01:21:29.317 --> 01:21:32.252
You know what happened? I
've been waiting for you a few hours.

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:33.481
Come and sit down.

01:21:40.362 --> 01:21:41.488

have to do something now!

When I was 15 she got
the course with me.

He does not remember because she chose something
stupid. He does not remember anything.

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:29.266
But I'm young and I told him,

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:34.281
that the ambassador Thelonostra
who actually raped me.

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:44.449
It was that he was not forgotten, and
he will never be allowed to know.

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:47.451
Because this is my fault.

It's yours.

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:05.504
You're raping me.
It's yours.

01:23:06.481 --> 01:23:09.450
It belonged to my father.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.298
Great uprising failed.

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:04.370
Heroes moment.

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:06.497
I am the enemy of all.

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:10.273
My mother and my sisters
still alive.

01:24:10.512 --> 01:24:12.480
General only human.

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:15.409
And played me like a deck of cards.

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:21.286
High population of Therenostra
and federations under the overseer.

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:24.290
100 people are safe.

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:27.260
That's right. I'm sure your mother knows.

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:30.396
How bombings in Kalisto, too?

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.528
I hope you are
giving orders.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.533
I told you ...

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:44.239
Give me the information.

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:59.393
So you're here to bring
exit command execution?

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:02.486
It seems you're right.

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:06.491
Yes.

01:25:07.368 --> 01:25:10.337
I pull you from here.

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:14.240
We have a war to fight, friend.

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:40.300
Terenostra fallen, and
federation is not far behind.

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:44.496
Valley that I use.

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.434
Will be my curse.

01:25:47.342 --> 01:25:49.401
And also there is hope.

01:25:50.305 --> 01:25:56.493
