00:00.078 --> 00:01.708
Previously on "Cloak & Dagger"...

00:01.738 --> 00:04.308
Given that you murdered
my firstborn in cold blood,

00:04.338 --> 00:06.578
we'll see if your value to Tyrone

00:06.608 --> 00:08.900
outweighs the need for
me to end your life.

00:08.925 --> 00:11.648
Leaving someone who
hurts you isn't hard, Mom.

00:11.678 --> 00:12.823
You just leave.

00:13.112 --> 00:15.418
In the dociles, there's
almost no activity

00:15.458 --> 00:17.494
in the anger and rage center
of the cerebral cortex.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.388
But in the aggressives, it's
as if there's nothing but...

00:20.428 --> 00:22.038
- Mayhem.
- That's what you do, right?

00:22.063 --> 00:24.434
You get inside people's
minds, and you cause them pain?

00:24.458 --> 00:26.698
If you can't be merciful
when you play God,

00:26.728 --> 00:29.290
what kind of God will you be
when you ain't playing no more?

00:29.315 --> 00:30.428
Why don't we find out?

00:30.468 --> 00:32.993
You and Tandy live in different worlds.

00:36.508 --> 00:37.578
Tandy!

00:44.408 --> 00:45.538
Ty?

00:46.137 --> 00:47.267
Ty!

00:47.748 --> 00:48.988
Hey, look at me.

00:49.501 --> 00:50.701
Look at me, Ty.

Hey!

01:49.351 --> 01:50.481
Hey, Ty, look at me.

01:52.330 --> 01:54.130
Tyrone! Come on, Tyrone!

02:18.738 --> 02:20.492
Started evaluating
the hookers right now,

02:20.517 --> 02:22.305
but they're too freaked out to talk.

02:22.330 --> 02:23.470
Uh, "victims".

02:24.199 --> 02:27.099
- They're victims.
- Yeah, of course they are.

02:28.518 --> 02:30.434
The owner of this motel,
have we picked him up yet?

02:30.458 --> 02:31.946
Yeah, in here an hour ago.

02:31.971 --> 02:33.995
Lawyers have already bailed him out.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.674
At least someone
took care of this place.

02:35.698 --> 02:37.388
Crime scene? Damage?

02:37.428 --> 02:38.957
He's out of business now, right?

02:39.340 --> 02:41.728
Kid, it'll be open again in a month.

02:42.027 --> 02:45.498
They don't call it the world's
oldest profession for nothing.

02:51.491 --> 02:52.651
Hi there.

02:54.508 --> 02:58.648
You know where I could
find some, uh, coffee

02:58.985 --> 03:00.378
around here?

03:00.418 --> 03:02.248
You thirsty, baby?

03:11.528 --> 03:13.228
Are you sure you're okay to drive?

03:19.155 --> 03:20.255
Hi there.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.266
Tandy, slow down.

03:24.478 --> 03:25.608
Auntie, you up yet?

03:28.018 --> 03:30.342
But... but I'm not a doctor. I don't...

03:35.130 --> 03:36.230
What happened?

03:38.114 --> 03:39.354
For how long?

03:39.588 --> 03:40.688
Okay.

03:41.210 --> 03:42.340
Okay.

03:42.698 --> 03:44.398
Okay, I'll be there soon.

04:10.262 --> 04:12.362
Hey! Hey, Ty!

04:13.728 --> 04:15.488
You're gonna be okay.

04:18.918 --> 04:20.118
You're gonna be okay.

04:21.567 --> 04:22.728
You're gonna wake up,

04:24.196 --> 04:25.685
and you're gonna walk out of here.

04:30.708 --> 04:31.978
Evita, over here!

04:34.933 --> 04:37.362
- Brigid.
- I just came from a torn-up motel

04:37.387 --> 04:38.848
that trafficked kidnapped girls.

04:39.271 --> 04:40.461
Are the girls okay?

04:41.688 --> 04:42.818
They're holding up.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.183
How about you?

04:46.310 --> 04:47.470
I'll live.

04:48.728 --> 04:50.528
But Ty, on the other hand.

05:04.205 --> 05:05.305
Hello, Father.

05:06.778 --> 05:08.294
I need a moment of your time.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.684
Mrs. Johnson.

05:13.927 --> 05:15.197
Do you know what this place is?

05:17.318 --> 05:18.558
I do.

05:18.832 --> 05:20.288
Then you know I'm not strong enough.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.000
Not strong enough for what?

05:23.528 --> 05:25.231
To let in the person I let down.

05:25.628 --> 05:27.358
I don't care about your feelings.

05:27.398 --> 05:28.698
You still have a job to do.

05:31.398 --> 05:32.968
Being a priest isn't a job.

05:34.508 --> 05:35.668
It's a life.

05:35.905 --> 05:37.568
And a life I failed at.

05:39.578 --> 05:40.708
I couldn't protect him.

05:40.865 --> 05:41.921
None of us could.

05:43.070 --> 05:44.718
But I found a way we can save him.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.416
Will you hear me out?

05:52.231 --> 05:54.534
For someone who's not a doctor,
you're rockin' like one.

05:54.558 --> 05:55.728
Yeah, maybe someday.

05:56.225 --> 05:57.545
Your aunt's still not picking up.

05:58.030 --> 05:59.598
But that's okay, right? You got this?

05:59.628 --> 06:02.553
I mean, I've watched
Auntie do tons of things,

06:03.368 --> 06:04.698
but this, it's...

06:05.438 --> 06:06.668
it's like Tyrone's...

06:07.586 --> 06:08.768
transitioning.

06:09.508 --> 06:12.678
Like his fight or flight
response is broken.

06:12.895 --> 06:14.945
This is what happens
when Ty gets scared.

06:15.285 --> 06:16.415
He opens a door.

06:16.518 --> 06:18.750
And if he's not responding,
maybe he's stuck.

06:19.038 --> 06:21.068
Stuck? Where?

06:21.541 --> 06:23.548
Wherever it is he taps into.

06:24.278 --> 06:27.503
Where your, uh, other
mouse got sucked into.

06:27.528 --> 06:29.428
- What, she's inside Ty?
- Yeah.

06:29.458 --> 06:31.671
I followed her in there and
landed at some crossroads

06:31.696 --> 06:33.787
where this Papa Mystery guy...

06:33.812 --> 06:35.628
- Papa Legba?
- Yes, him.

06:35.991 --> 06:37.849
And when I went inside
Ty, all of this...

06:37.874 --> 06:39.598
it looked like this.

06:41.268 --> 06:42.684
I don't know, maybe this
is Ty's way of telling us

06:42.708 --> 06:44.468
we have to go in there and get him.

06:44.508 --> 06:45.638
Okay.

06:45.678 --> 06:47.478
Papa Legba is a Loa.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.708
Guardian of the Crossroads.

06:50.548 --> 06:52.278
A Voudon God.

06:53.361 --> 06:54.714
And Auntie's husband.

06:54.976 --> 06:57.391
- Say what now?
- Auntie's a Mambo.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.418
Part of that means marrying a Loa.

07:00.498 --> 07:04.345
- Like a nun marries God?
- Kind of. But not really.

07:06.568 --> 07:08.328
This is his veve.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.257
And, um...

07:13.308 --> 07:15.668
Auntie always has me
carry candy for Legba.

07:16.429 --> 07:18.187
Says he has a sweet tooth.

07:18.212 --> 07:20.112
But if you want something from him,

07:20.248 --> 07:21.624
he's gonna need an offering in return.

07:21.648 --> 07:22.748
Good to know.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.378
Okay.

07:30.518 --> 07:33.731
Papa Legba, we ask you
to present yourself.

07:46.919 --> 07:48.568
Please accept this offering.

07:48.817 --> 07:51.286
In exchange, we ask
you to show us the way.

07:52.006 --> 07:53.834
Your children are here waiting.

07:54.267 --> 07:56.397
A good man is suffering.

08:04.288 --> 08:06.718
I give thanks to you and our ancestors.

08:07.124 --> 08:08.824
We ask you to open the gates.

08:09.498 --> 08:12.015
We implore you to show us the way in.

08:18.273 --> 08:19.513
You're jumping into that?

08:22.134 --> 08:23.464
He would do it for me.

08:26.678 --> 08:27.748
Okay.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.584
Let's go.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.664
Brigid, you don't know
what it's like in there.

08:32.688 --> 08:33.818
Let's go.

09:19.202 --> 09:20.302
You're back for more.

09:22.232 --> 09:24.405
So you come in all
shapes and sizes, huh?

09:25.748 --> 09:26.848
Fuchs?

09:27.342 --> 09:28.442
Fuchs?

09:29.000 --> 09:32.210
Hmm, I've seen part of you here before.

09:32.412 --> 09:34.582
You refused to pay
the fee that I demand.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.399
This fee?

09:39.222 --> 09:40.952
Guess I got overcharged last time.

09:44.362 --> 09:45.522
Okay.

09:45.562 --> 09:47.392
This is where we find Ty.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.602
Wait a second. Where's the mall?

09:52.892 --> 09:56.172
- Did you say mall?
- Yeah, it's all crazy here.

10:05.574 --> 10:06.723
Tandy?

10:07.295 --> 10:09.035
Tandy Bowen has her path.

10:10.422 --> 10:12.382
You came to walk a
different one, didn't you?

10:14.151 --> 10:15.151
Ty?

10:25.051 --> 10:26.051
Ty?

10:26.169 --> 10:27.375
Everything here is a trade.

10:27.532 --> 10:31.202
To get what you want, know
what you're willing to give up.

10:32.797 --> 10:35.807
You here to win a prize, little lady?

10:43.824 --> 10:44.963
Right, um...

10:47.165 --> 10:48.266
I got some gum.

10:48.291 --> 10:50.681
Oh, Spearmint!

10:53.751 --> 10:55.322
It's not really you, is it?

10:57.632 --> 10:58.769
No.

11:00.472 --> 11:01.562
But it's nice to see you.

11:30.294 --> 11:32.554
Papa Sweet-Tooth sent me this way.

11:33.551 --> 11:36.191
I'm here for my friend, Mister...

11:36.216 --> 11:38.486
Baron Samedi.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.665
I reside over the dead.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.000
No, uh, Ty, he isn't dead.

11:44.025 --> 11:46.425
Close enough. He made his payment.

11:47.757 --> 11:49.041
Payment?

11:49.589 --> 11:51.519
Well, what did he give you?

11:51.809 --> 11:52.809
His worries.

11:55.522 --> 11:57.352
Then I'll pay his debt.

11:57.392 --> 11:59.322
I can make it rain with worries.

12:05.006 --> 12:08.266
That's what they sell you
day in and day out, isn't it?

12:08.502 --> 12:11.332
That one thing is
equal worth to another.

12:11.372 --> 12:14.073
That burger is a dollar.
Love costs your body.

12:14.098 --> 12:17.258
And that house? Just your soul.

12:18.057 --> 12:20.521
Piece by piece by piece.

12:21.512 --> 12:23.512
But every action has its own reaction,

12:23.552 --> 12:25.639
as much as we'd like to avoid it.

12:26.506 --> 12:29.152
Isn't that right, Miss Bowen?

12:33.089 --> 12:34.576
What if I play you for him?

12:38.293 --> 12:40.082
Tell you what:

12:40.107 --> 12:41.683
you play his game.

12:42.302 --> 12:44.372
And if you can convince him to leave,

12:44.753 --> 12:47.472
I'll let you both go.

12:52.642 --> 12:54.382
But don't forget...

12:54.412 --> 12:56.412
you in Samedi's house.

12:56.452 --> 13:00.352
And the house always wins.

13:02.192 --> 13:03.392
This could save Tyrone,

13:03.422 --> 13:05.322
this could get justice for Billy,

13:05.362 --> 13:08.262
and this could bring down every
corrupt officer in New Orleans

13:08.292 --> 13:10.292
if it gets into the hands of the FBI.

13:11.402 --> 13:13.132
But I can't give it to them.

13:14.302 --> 13:15.578
Because they'd ask how you acquired it.

13:15.602 --> 13:18.332
And I'd have to, by law, answer them.

13:18.372 --> 13:21.502
But a priest has protection
against revealing his source.

13:23.542 --> 13:25.472
Think of the good it
will do for the community.

13:25.512 --> 13:27.242
Everyone knowing that they can breathe.

13:27.282 --> 13:29.612
I wish I could help you. I do.

13:29.652 --> 13:32.760
- Are you saying no?
- I'm saying when I left St. Sebastian's,

13:32.785 --> 13:34.515
I left my collar behind.

13:36.012 --> 13:37.272
I'm not a priest anymore.

13:43.332 --> 13:45.492
I could go
and take my nursing aide test.

13:46.632 --> 13:48.432
Find some way to take care of you.

13:50.209 --> 13:51.649
I mean, unless you don't want me to.

13:53.602 --> 13:54.672
Come on.

13:55.512 --> 13:56.812
Let me drive.

14:01.182 --> 14:02.412
Give me that!

14:06.322 --> 14:07.522
You okay?

14:07.552 --> 14:08.692
Lia...

14:10.352 --> 14:11.352
I need more.

14:12.462 --> 14:13.492
No!

14:15.052 --> 14:16.393
No, I can't go through that again.

14:16.417 --> 14:18.517
I just need enough to
get us someplace safe.

14:22.502 --> 14:24.402
It will be the last time.

14:25.067 --> 14:26.197
I promise.

16:02.572 --> 16:04.502
- What the hell?
- Shhh!

16:23.112 --> 16:24.423
Papa Legba,

16:25.025 --> 16:27.454
I call upon you to bring this young man,

16:27.484 --> 16:30.194
so near to crossing over, back.

16:31.464 --> 16:33.424
Give me the sight to see what's ahead.

16:39.564 --> 16:41.961
No. That can't be.

16:56.254 --> 16:57.384
Auntie...

17:00.424 --> 17:01.524
Ty?

17:04.493 --> 17:06.294
I've come to take you home.

17:09.634 --> 17:11.364
- Hey, Ty!
- Sure.

17:11.394 --> 17:12.564
Sure, I just...

17:13.163 --> 17:14.463
I need to, uh...

17:16.194 --> 17:17.454
I need to finish this.

17:18.473 --> 17:20.520
Come on. Listen, a lot of
people are worried about...

17:20.544 --> 17:21.574
Dammit!

17:27.644 --> 17:29.138
Come on.

17:29.163 --> 17:31.234
If I'm gonna beat this,
I'm gonna need your help.

17:39.928 --> 17:41.062
Okay.

17:41.851 --> 17:43.424
Ready or not.

17:47.971 --> 17:50.304
- Is that me?
- It's just setting up the story.

17:50.334 --> 17:51.634
Watch.

17:51.674 --> 17:55.033
_

17:55.416 --> 17:56.616
_

17:56.640 --> 17:58.640
_

18:00.428 --> 18:02.928
_

18:05.022 --> 18:07.022
_

18:07.046 --> 18:10.006
_

18:11.982 --> 18:15.369
_

18:15.394 --> 18:16.925
- Radioactive heroin?
- _

18:16.950 --> 18:18.394
Hey, stop ruining it.

18:20.504 --> 18:22.234
- Now let's go.
- Go!

18:22.274 --> 18:23.514
Which button do I... ah!

18:24.938 --> 18:26.238
Ty...

18:26.544 --> 18:27.957
Baron Whatzit, he...

18:29.374 --> 18:31.274
he says that if you
come home with me then...

18:31.314 --> 18:32.514
Get this one right here!

18:32.544 --> 18:34.664
We gotta beat all these guys
to get to the next level.

18:38.524 --> 18:39.554
_

18:40.684 --> 18:42.354
Okay!

18:43.624 --> 18:44.992
Okay, it's over. We did it.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.494
- Listen, Ty...
- Not yet.

18:47.524 --> 18:48.564
We got more to do.

18:49.694 --> 18:51.464
That was just a warm up.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.304
Ty, come on. This is ridiculous!

18:59.344 --> 19:00.944
I mean, all of them
are dressed the same!

19:02.214 --> 19:05.144
Okay, and the two guys I just
took out just disappeared.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.144
Ty, come on! You have to come home!

19:14.976 --> 19:16.976
None of this even makes any sense!

19:18.364 --> 19:20.524
That's the point! It doesn't have to!

19:21.243 --> 19:23.424
There's no gangland ecosystems.

19:23.464 --> 19:26.164
No street wars. No more gray area.

19:26.204 --> 19:27.304
No consequences.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.404
We fight and we win.

19:39.112 --> 19:40.172
Fine.

19:45.454 --> 19:47.284
Tandy!

19:52.104 --> 19:54.127
_

19:54.152 --> 19:57.428
_

20:08.566 --> 20:11.696
- What is this place?
- Not the Garden City Mall, that's for damn sure.

20:12.584 --> 20:14.314
I spent so many weekends there.

20:14.344 --> 20:15.514
Dad handed me cash,

20:15.554 --> 20:17.291
said, "I'll meet you in the
food court in a couple of hours".

20:17.315 --> 20:18.986
Yeah, and I blew it all on a manicure,

20:19.011 --> 20:22.324
because Mom always said you
can tell a lady by her hands.

20:26.222 --> 20:28.192
I'm not here to stroll
down memory lane with you.

20:28.217 --> 20:30.434
No, you're here to kill me

20:30.464 --> 20:32.564
or subdue me or something me,

20:32.604 --> 20:34.464
but we got bigger fish to fry. Look.

20:48.554 --> 20:50.124
There's a lot of girls in here.

20:50.220 --> 20:52.220
I thought you were a detective.

20:52.890 --> 20:54.484
Those aren't just girls.

20:54.524 --> 20:56.244
Those are the missing
girls from the fliers.

20:57.703 --> 21:00.775
That man in the suit, whoever he is...

21:01.329 --> 21:03.359
I think he's the one that's taking them.

21:03.634 --> 21:05.806
He comes in here, plays
these records, and...

21:06.304 --> 21:07.664
And makes them feel pain.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.580
That music he was playing before...

21:10.604 --> 21:12.334
it sounded like pure dread.

21:13.474 --> 21:15.344
Maybe you are a detective.

21:17.079 --> 21:19.079
He uses them up. I don't know why.

21:19.548 --> 21:20.748
And he can get to anyone.

21:25.050 --> 21:28.380
Unless we can find something
strong enough to stop him.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.077
Auntie, thank goodness you came!

21:39.102 --> 21:40.504
You got all my messages.

21:42.101 --> 21:45.161
Now, child. Don't be foolish.

21:45.186 --> 21:47.449
I know you got my message in the shells.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.594
I thought I read them wrong.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.301
Don't cry.

21:52.057 --> 21:55.017
It's my time to dance
with the ancestors.

21:55.042 --> 21:56.272
You'll see.

21:56.554 --> 22:01.154
But now it's your turn
to take my place as Mambo.

22:02.082 --> 22:04.052
Auntie, no.

22:04.269 --> 22:05.569
I'm going to college,

22:05.594 --> 22:07.364
and then I'm going to medical school.

22:11.264 --> 22:14.304
Child, that was just you being selfish.

22:14.334 --> 22:15.564
Well, I'm allowed to be!

22:15.604 --> 22:17.574
Okay? All my life, they laughed at me

22:17.604 --> 22:19.534
for stinking up my purse with roots,

22:19.574 --> 22:20.674
giving those tours.

22:20.704 --> 22:24.214
- Now I'm supposed to...
- You were born with the sight.

22:24.244 --> 22:26.414
They chose you to be a voice,

22:26.444 --> 22:28.244
to guide people.

22:28.612 --> 22:31.384
- Nothing else matters.
- Don't I have a choice?

22:32.244 --> 22:34.065
You have all the choices, child.

22:34.331 --> 22:35.624
You always have.

22:36.694 --> 22:38.554
But only one will save your man.

22:43.564 --> 22:46.394
But if I do, then I have to...

22:46.434 --> 22:48.434
Marry a Loa.

22:49.082 --> 22:51.574
One with dominion over
the dead and dying.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.191
You choose whatever you choose.

22:59.946 --> 23:02.046
Just do it with that head held high.

23:02.969 --> 23:04.329
Like you always do.

23:16.657 --> 23:17.797
Auntie, I...

23:20.464 --> 23:23.334
Sometimes I feel
like my collar, my calling,

23:23.374 --> 23:26.334
was nothing more than
a prison ball and chain.

23:26.374 --> 23:28.344
I killed a girl, Mrs. Johnson.

23:28.374 --> 23:31.474
And to atone, I was supposed
to look out for your boy.

23:33.384 --> 23:34.944
You know what my last words were to Ty?

23:36.126 --> 23:38.272
"Just go. Now".

23:38.297 --> 23:40.131
And you think that
there's a price to pay,

23:41.027 --> 23:44.067
because there are
consequences to our actions.

23:44.238 --> 23:45.308
Yes.

23:46.524 --> 23:49.394
They destroyed my boys
just for living their lives.

23:49.434 --> 23:51.394
Men who were supposed
to "serve and protect".

23:51.434 --> 23:52.937
And for every corrupt cop,

23:52.962 --> 23:54.664
there's a politician just as heinous.

23:54.704 --> 23:57.434
- There are no consequences...
- There has to be.

23:57.474 --> 24:00.604
If we don't have faith
that this world...

24:00.644 --> 24:03.604
that we can get better, we won't.

24:04.838 --> 24:05.938
We won't.

24:07.384 --> 24:08.584
You really believe that?

24:11.414 --> 24:12.484
Yeah.

24:14.584 --> 24:15.684
Good.

24:17.454 --> 24:19.872
That's the man my son needs now.

24:21.694 --> 24:23.294
I can't just take the files.

24:23.334 --> 24:25.534
In the eyes of the
church, your information

24:25.564 --> 24:28.364
is only considered privileged
if you make confession.

24:31.085 --> 24:34.295
Mrs. Johnson, do you have
something you want to confess?

24:36.729 --> 24:39.489
Level Two is about making
it across to the next door.

24:39.514 --> 24:41.344
That's easy enough for you.

24:41.384 --> 24:42.684
You can just poof up there.

24:42.714 --> 24:44.354
Yeah, but what fun would that be?

24:45.424 --> 24:47.284
Come on, Tandy.

24:47.324 --> 24:50.594
After everything, haven't we earned it?

24:50.624 --> 24:51.694
Look out!

25:14.344 --> 25:17.184
- What?
- You're really good at this.

25:18.042 --> 25:19.182
Damn right!

25:20.524 --> 25:22.384
You know, I was never much of a gamer,

25:22.424 --> 25:24.594
but I'm starting to
think I missed my calling.

25:33.564 --> 25:34.664
Wait, this...

25:37.274 --> 25:39.274
- We're back at the...
- Motel.

26:21.828 --> 26:23.328
_

26:26.252 --> 26:28.752
_

26:33.914 --> 26:35.244
Ty, let's go back.

26:35.274 --> 26:36.874
No, we can't.

26:46.154 --> 26:47.589
They just keep coming.

26:47.614 --> 26:48.884
Ty...

26:49.164 --> 26:51.924
I don't want to do
this. I can't do this!

26:51.964 --> 26:54.310
Last time you were alone, but
this time I'm not leaving you.

26:54.334 --> 26:57.264
Okay? We're gonna fight
and we're gonna win!

27:32.553 --> 27:34.713
Just cut through it. We're almost there.

27:43.314 --> 27:44.414
Ty...

27:45.144 --> 27:47.854
Ty, this is a waste of time!
You have to stop playing!

27:47.884 --> 27:50.769
No, Tandy, the screen said we
had to break down the walls.

27:50.794 --> 27:51.894
All right?

27:52.054 --> 27:54.854
We fight through this.
This is how we win.

28:10.004 --> 28:12.072
Who knows? Maybe...

28:12.717 --> 28:14.687
Maybe this is just all in my head.

28:58.875 --> 28:59.875
Are you okay?

29:01.394 --> 29:03.154
Yeah.

29:03.194 --> 29:05.324
How many more rooms do
we have to go through?

29:05.364 --> 29:08.134
Just one. It's the boss level.

29:21.546 --> 29:24.416
All right, Tandy. Let's kill him.

29:30.106 --> 29:31.206
Tandy?

29:32.154 --> 29:33.384
Jesus.

29:33.424 --> 29:35.338
You chewed these things to shreds.

29:35.946 --> 29:37.276
Anxious about something?

29:38.634 --> 29:39.964
What color is that?

29:40.731 --> 29:41.823
Poison.

29:42.409 --> 29:43.732
Literally, that's the name.

29:43.757 --> 29:45.727
What can I say, I have a brand.

29:47.304 --> 29:49.434
We used to choose the craziest colors.

29:49.646 --> 29:51.958
Glitter Bomb Gold and Unicorn Puke.

29:51.983 --> 29:54.150
Yeah, and then Dad would see
them and say something like,

29:54.174 --> 29:55.890
"Oh, my little girl is a smurf today".

29:55.915 --> 29:58.215
Or some other lame dad thing like that.

29:58.444 --> 30:00.214
Dad was good at being a lame dad.

30:02.154 --> 30:04.424
Ow! What?

30:04.454 --> 30:06.254
You don't see the way the world is.

30:06.294 --> 30:08.070
Dad only took us to the
mall so he could flirt

30:08.094 --> 30:09.454
with that bookstore manager.

30:11.264 --> 30:12.336
Yeah?

30:12.891 --> 30:14.694
And you can't see that
Dad took us to the mall

30:14.719 --> 30:17.394
because everything about the
house reminded him of Mom.

30:19.404 --> 30:21.134
Hey. Easy.

30:22.031 --> 30:24.058
The man was two parents to four kids.

30:24.745 --> 30:25.816
He deserved some happiness,

30:25.840 --> 30:27.710
even if it was with a bookstore manager.

30:29.036 --> 30:31.066
Your perspective is warped.

30:31.244 --> 30:33.344
You only see the bad and come at it.

30:37.254 --> 30:40.424
The problem is, right now,
I think the world might need

30:40.454 --> 30:43.124
someone like you more than
it needs someone like me.

30:44.494 --> 30:45.857
You know what I saw today?

30:46.464 --> 30:49.732
A motel where those girls
from the fliers ended up.

30:50.404 --> 30:51.504
And the one who did it?

30:52.334 --> 30:53.704
The man in your record store?

30:57.832 --> 30:59.832
I'm not gonna be able
to catch him without you.

31:08.114 --> 31:10.154
I'm not gonna be put in a
box just to be brought out

31:10.184 --> 31:12.552
whenever we have road rage
or another dead boyfriend.

31:12.577 --> 31:14.075
I don't wanna put you in a box.

31:15.194 --> 31:16.934
I just need you to listen sometimes.

31:17.914 --> 31:19.044
So what are you saying?

31:20.364 --> 31:21.564
I'm saying...

31:22.946 --> 31:24.176
you get to drive.

32:07.945 --> 32:09.045
Hey.

32:11.304 --> 32:13.404
Just so you know, your game sucks.

32:13.442 --> 32:15.582
Don't hate the game, hate
the player who chose it.

32:34.562 --> 32:38.502
In this world and the ones unseen,

32:39.237 --> 32:41.532
always in faith of Voudon...

32:42.656 --> 32:43.997
Why'd you stop?

32:44.022 --> 32:46.062
Now to win we have to go all
the way back to the beginning.

32:46.086 --> 32:47.334
- Who cares?
- I do!

32:47.951 --> 32:49.629
Look, I'm tired of losing, Tandy!

32:50.129 --> 32:53.412
I'm tired of working our
asses off just to tie.

32:53.452 --> 32:55.182
For the rest of my days...

32:56.722 --> 32:58.622
I am yours.

33:02.104 --> 33:04.134
- Did it work?
- But it's not real!

33:04.362 --> 33:06.562
Ty, come on! You have to come back!

33:07.927 --> 33:09.022
Where we can lose?

33:10.532 --> 33:12.217
Where the only payoff is pain?

33:13.625 --> 33:14.755
Why?

33:29.522 --> 33:31.252
You know what's real?

33:31.292 --> 33:32.862
You're dying, Ty.

33:34.362 --> 33:35.592
What about your mom?

33:37.081 --> 33:39.181
What about Evita? What about me?

33:42.632 --> 33:45.262
Why did you come to that
motel and try and save me?

33:47.044 --> 33:48.884
Because I couldn't imagine
my life without you.

33:50.132 --> 33:51.222
I did.

33:52.512 --> 33:53.572
Andre...

33:54.412 --> 33:58.612
he made me see you dying in front of me.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.094
And the one person in the whole world

34:02.119 --> 34:04.389
who understood me was
gone and it was my fault.

34:10.491 --> 34:12.221
He messed with my head, too.

34:13.492 --> 34:15.262
Made me feel like you
never cared about me.

34:15.302 --> 34:16.601
Like it was all just an act.

34:17.981 --> 34:19.221
You know, maybe you're right.

34:20.022 --> 34:24.542
Maybe it is better to ignore everything.

34:25.954 --> 34:28.502
All I know is I'd rather fight

34:28.527 --> 34:31.268
a hundred times with you
than one time without you.

34:32.206 --> 34:33.452
To have and to hold...

34:33.482 --> 34:34.558
So if you're staying here...

34:34.581 --> 34:36.552
In sickness and in health...

34:38.422 --> 34:39.552
so am I.

34:46.431 --> 34:48.661
Well, what will it be, boy?

34:49.376 --> 34:52.402
Face the harsh world or keep
it cozy with your friend?

34:53.472 --> 34:54.472
I...

34:55.929 --> 34:57.750
- Oops. Too late.
- You can't!

34:57.775 --> 35:00.660
A boy dawdles, and the
decision is made in his stead.

35:02.707 --> 35:03.746
Look.

35:04.644 --> 35:07.061
- Wait, what is that?
- A wedding bouquet.

35:07.452 --> 35:10.858
And you, my boy, are the bride price.

35:10.883 --> 35:14.244
A life for a life. The
bouquet for the cloak.

35:15.192 --> 35:16.192
But I...

35:17.532 --> 35:19.262
I don't understand.

35:19.292 --> 35:21.562
Time for you two to scat and
take your friends with you.

35:21.822 --> 35:24.432
The missus like a clean house.

35:25.702 --> 35:28.602
Ty! Ty!

35:32.962 --> 35:34.010
Tandy?

35:34.964 --> 35:36.482
It worked!

35:36.512 --> 35:38.342
Ty, are you okay?

35:38.382 --> 35:40.482
- Yeah, I think so.
- Well, thank Christ for that.

35:40.522 --> 35:42.182
Brigid! You made it out!

35:42.222 --> 35:44.222
Well, I couldn't help it.
Just rode the tsunami.

35:45.181 --> 35:47.211
I saw him. In the record store.

35:47.462 --> 35:49.005
I don't know his name, but you do.

35:49.030 --> 35:50.200
Andre Deschaine.

35:52.037 --> 35:53.508
He's probably already on the run by now.

35:53.532 --> 35:55.682
Good, I like them running.

35:56.067 --> 35:57.291
I like them scared.

35:57.983 --> 35:59.013
Hey...

36:00.572 --> 36:02.135
Brigid did make it out, right?

36:03.976 --> 36:06.076
Sure. She's in here, too.

36:15.382 --> 36:17.322
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

36:17.687 --> 36:19.320
It's been...

36:20.222 --> 36:23.362
seven years since my last confession.

36:25.362 --> 36:27.462
But today I have something to confess.

36:29.191 --> 36:31.207
The man who murdered my son

36:32.472 --> 36:35.232
and framed my other son for murder...

36:36.746 --> 36:38.502
I held him captive.

36:38.542 --> 36:40.442
The overhead light's out,

36:40.482 --> 36:42.242
so use the switch by the sink.

36:43.318 --> 36:44.886
Thank you.

36:44.911 --> 36:46.488
He gave me the information I needed

36:46.512 --> 36:48.312
to clear Tyrone's name.

36:48.352 --> 36:51.282
He gave me the location
of my other son's body.

36:52.055 --> 36:53.622
All he wanted was forgiveness.

36:55.035 --> 36:56.035
Mrs. Johnson...

36:58.090 --> 36:59.960
What did you do?

37:16.442 --> 37:18.412
This is why you needed a priest?

37:18.452 --> 37:20.152
To confess to murder?

37:21.552 --> 37:26.422
You came to me talking about
faith and forgiveness...

37:26.452 --> 37:27.492
Tyrone needs your faith.

37:28.622 --> 37:31.292
Tyrone needs someone
to make his case to God.

37:33.592 --> 37:36.462
Me? I just need a priest.

38:02.592 --> 38:04.492
Oh boy.

38:06.332 --> 38:07.592
Of course.

38:47.131 --> 38:48.221
Evita...

39:03.352 --> 39:04.574
Mom?

39:12.151 --> 39:13.351
Mom?

41:09.232 --> 41:10.332
We're gonna get him,

41:11.738 --> 41:12.808
you know that?
