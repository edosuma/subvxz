00:48.782 --> 00:53.286
Entertainment Weekly,
bringing you the latest news in showbiz.

00:53.620 --> 00:54.454
HERSHE AND I:DN

00:54.554 --> 00:55.388
Rian's here.

00:56.856 --> 00:59.726
What is it
that I want to try doing at school?

01:00.794 --> 01:03.396
Playing hooky. Sneaking out of school.

01:03.463 --> 01:06.599
Eating spicy rice cakes with friends.
There are a lot of things I want to do.

01:06.666 --> 01:09.736
Most importantly, the uniform is so cute.
Get a good shot of me.

01:10.270 --> 01:11.104
Of course.

01:14.541 --> 01:15.975
Isn't it cute?

01:16.109 --> 01:17.110
Not really.

01:18.211 --> 01:23.083
I can't wait to go on field trips
and class trips.

01:23.516 --> 01:25.552
I also want to study hard

01:25.952 --> 01:30.757
and write a love letter
if there's a hot single teacher.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.428
-Just a letter?
-I think I would do a good job

01:35.495 --> 01:37.363
of keeping the classroom
neat and beautiful too.

01:37.764 --> 01:38.598
No way.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.233
-No?
-No.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.268
-Then should I be a class president?
-Yes.

01:43.236 --> 01:46.272
It was a bit sad saying goodbye
to my friends at my old school.

01:46.673 --> 01:49.709
-You only went there three times a year.
-That's not true.

01:50.710 --> 01:53.613
-Hello, we are I:dn.
-Hello, we are I:dn.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.716
I'm not actually
that interested in school--

01:56.783 --> 01:57.617
Well...

01:58.885 --> 01:59.752
Hello.

01:59.819 --> 02:03.890
I violated SUCPA
and caused a huge trouble.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.726
-I'll take time to think about--
-Get off your high horse.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.195
-We are HershE.
-We are HershE.

02:10.196 --> 02:13.399
Since we're all in our uniforms,
why don't we take a picture?

02:13.466 --> 02:15.435
-Cool.
-One, two, three.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.182
Guys, JB's here!

02:29.782 --> 02:31.718
-What?
-Are you serious?

02:32.218 --> 02:33.486
-Hey, where?
-Where?

02:34.754 --> 02:37.056
-Hurry!
-This is crazy.

02:37.123 --> 02:38.124
Hurry!

02:40.260 --> 02:42.996
Get me my song back.

02:43.062 --> 02:44.564
I told you I'll make something for you!

02:44.631 --> 02:47.467
I don't want it.
So, restore the deleted file.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.469
I said I want it back!

03:05.752 --> 03:08.688
-Move aside!
-Move, you're in my way.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.028
-What the hell?
-Who's that?

03:15.094 --> 03:17.964
-JB, don't worry. I'll protect you.
-Move!

03:24.804 --> 03:27.874
What's your problem? Are you a pervert?

03:28.575 --> 03:30.877
-Get lost!
-Hey!

03:34.514 --> 03:36.649
Shin Hae-seong!
What the hell are you doing?

03:38.751 --> 03:39.686
Hey!

03:40.320 --> 03:41.187
What?

03:43.957 --> 03:45.124
Mind your lips.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.495
You want to take pictures, right?

03:49.729 --> 03:50.930
-Yes.
-Yes.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.299
You take lots of pictures
on field trips, right?

03:53.366 --> 03:54.434
-Yes.
-Yes.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.503
You should etch
what's important and precious

03:59.038 --> 04:01.274
in your heart.

04:01.341 --> 04:05.211
Do you want to waste your life
snapping pictures? Is that what you want?

04:07.180 --> 04:09.015
You want to be in girl groups, right?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.083
-Yes.
-Yes.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.685
Then you shouldn't be taking pictures.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.721
You should have fans
taking pictures of you.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.522
Right?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.825
Focus on this finger.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.860
Okay? Look.

04:26.466 --> 04:27.634
See you around.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.103
-No.
-No.

04:30.169 --> 04:31.871
-Don't take him.
-JB!

04:32.005 --> 04:34.707
What's going on, Hae-seong?
Are you friends with JB?

04:35.642 --> 04:36.476
Well...

04:36.542 --> 04:39.746
We've run into each other once or twice.

04:40.179 --> 04:43.149
-Really?
-That's awesome.

04:43.216 --> 04:46.819
Why was he fighting with Jin Yu-jin?
What happened?

04:47.020 --> 04:47.887
Oh, right.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.757
Have you seen that vile dirtbag?

04:55.728 --> 04:57.230
School isn't over yet.
Where are you going?

04:57.297 --> 04:58.231
Mind your own business.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.300
You'd better watch out.

05:00.366 --> 05:02.835
You have a 99% chance
of being terrorized by the girls.

05:02.902 --> 05:06.339
You can mess with the president,
but not with an idol.

05:08.174 --> 05:10.009
Are you a properly initiated shaman?

05:11.377 --> 05:12.945
Can you stand on sharp blades?

05:13.913 --> 05:16.716
Don't look down on me because I'm a phony.

05:17.283 --> 05:18.551
Like you're not one yourself.

05:23.189 --> 05:24.123
A phony?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.426
Are you...

05:27.260 --> 05:28.895
yanking at my hair?

05:29.862 --> 05:30.697
Are you...

05:32.198 --> 05:33.633
going to beat me up?

05:34.267 --> 05:36.569
I just grabbed whatever
was convenient to grab.

05:36.636 --> 05:38.037
Why would I beat you up?

05:38.538 --> 05:41.641
You could have grabbed me by the hand.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.710
See how easy it is?

05:45.011 --> 05:47.013
Do I not look like a girl to you?

05:47.413 --> 05:49.215
You think shaman's don't have feelings?

05:49.682 --> 05:53.219
I'm not even a real shaman.
This is hurtful.

05:53.653 --> 05:55.154
I'm hurt!

05:55.888 --> 05:57.156
Hey, Park Sun-dong!

05:58.257 --> 05:59.459
Damn it.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.666
Are we transferring to Kirin Art School?

06:07.767 --> 06:09.202
Everyone at the agency?

06:09.268 --> 06:12.004
You, of all people, shouldn't show
any dissatisfaction with my decision.

06:12.805 --> 06:16.075
This happened sooner than planned
because you got everyone banned.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.645
You said you wanted some time to practice.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.281
Send me overseas instead.

06:24.417 --> 06:27.153
After what you have done,
people will think you're running away.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.255
But why Kirin?

06:30.089 --> 06:31.324
It's a crappy school.

06:32.024 --> 06:34.994
We'll turn it around. Don't you worry.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.306
Congrats, Shin Hae-seong.

06:48.674 --> 06:49.609
You are chosen

06:49.675 --> 06:51.210
as the most photogenic person
of the month.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.584
THE MOST PHOTOGENIC PERSON OF THE MONTH

06:59.786 --> 07:03.189
I'm using it as my laptop background too.

07:04.457 --> 07:07.360
It really cheers me up when I'm down.

07:09.128 --> 07:11.264
Did Jin Yu-jin give it to you?

07:11.330 --> 07:14.667
No. I bought it from him for 500 won.

07:16.302 --> 07:19.038
I never download anything illegally.

07:20.072 --> 07:24.143
Infringing on my portrait rights
is worse than illegal downloading.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.880
Jin Yu-jin, that vile scumbag.
What's his room number?

07:32.051 --> 07:33.653
-Ui-bong.
-Yes?

07:34.854 --> 07:37.156
Did you hear
what JB and I were talking about?

07:37.857 --> 07:38.925
I heard it went live.

07:39.091 --> 07:40.927
No. I was sleeping.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.997
But the girls are saying
all kinds of nasty things about you.

07:45.531 --> 07:48.067
I had no idea girls had such potty mouths.

07:54.674 --> 07:55.842
So close.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.979
Jin Yu-jin.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.781
Jin Yu-jin!

08:06.352 --> 08:07.320
Slimy jerk.

08:09.021 --> 08:12.825
That vile scumbag.
He has to have all his hair pulled out.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.460
Just wait until I get my hands on him.

08:17.797 --> 08:19.031
Slimy jerk.

08:19.098 --> 08:19.932
Jin Yu-jin!

08:25.805 --> 08:26.906
You little...

08:27.907 --> 08:30.376
-How dare you do that to JB's face--
-This is the men's dorm.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.779
I'm the resident assistant.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.448
Oh, big deal.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.817
No wonder this place is a mess.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.354
Three minutes from now,

08:41.654 --> 08:44.824
you'll be on your knees
begging me for forgiveness.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.593
I'll make you leave
in exactly three seconds.

08:48.027 --> 08:48.928
Let go.

08:50.496 --> 08:52.665
You're staying with Ui-bong
without proper authorization.

08:53.132 --> 08:53.966
One second.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.436
As the resident assistant,
I can't ignore an illegal occupant.

08:57.503 --> 08:58.404
Two seconds.

08:58.471 --> 09:01.541
You should leave before you get evicted.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.376
Three seconds. Time's up.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.712
-Let go. Hey, let go of me.
-Hey.

09:07.079 --> 09:08.247
Let go.

09:08.814 --> 09:09.649
Let go!

09:20.326 --> 09:23.563
Do you have any idea
what I went through to get the autographs?

09:24.063 --> 09:28.568
They meant so much to me.

09:28.634 --> 09:31.370
They stood for something
very important to me.

09:31.737 --> 09:35.708
You crushed what little hope I had,

09:36.075 --> 09:37.944
and to boot,
you shot that awful picture of me.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.812
My ear. It hurts!

09:40.246 --> 09:43.282
Has the 500 won you got for selling
my picture raised your standard of living?

09:44.083 --> 09:46.252
My ear. Are you nuts?

09:46.319 --> 09:48.287
As the daughter of a pastor...

09:49.555 --> 09:51.557
Your father's a pastor?

09:52.124 --> 09:53.492
As the daughter of a pastor,

09:53.559 --> 09:57.229
I can let all that go
as I'm kind and understanding.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.665
But what about my song?

09:59.732 --> 10:02.501
You know very well
who made that song for me.

10:03.135 --> 10:03.970
Fine.

10:05.037 --> 10:06.272
Take my ear. Rip it off.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.077
Pull on the count of three, okay?

10:12.111 --> 10:14.280
You have to pull.

10:14.981 --> 10:15.815
One,

10:17.083 --> 10:20.186
-two...
-You don't think I can pull?

10:20.252 --> 10:21.754
What are you doing? Don't be so ignorant.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.924
The audition deadline is tomorrow.

10:25.257 --> 10:27.493
There won't be another one
for the next six months.

10:27.893 --> 10:30.329
I'll have to wait six more months
without even having given it a try.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.898
Because of who? Because of you.

10:36.869 --> 10:38.571
You're not good enough
to pass the audition,

10:38.638 --> 10:39.939
so don't use me as an excuse.

10:40.606 --> 10:43.709
Plus, I said I would arrange your song,
but you refused.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.277
I'm not settling for second-best.

10:45.945 --> 10:47.546
You're not JB.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.183
No, you're nothing.

10:51.550 --> 10:52.618
You're worthless.

11:02.294 --> 11:04.463
Are you okay?

11:08.868 --> 11:11.137
It was you who begged me
to arrange your song.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.974
I don't have tolerance
for people who are fickle.

11:16.475 --> 11:17.309
Hey!

11:17.710 --> 11:18.911
Isn't that blood?

11:22.248 --> 11:23.282
Did you two fight?

11:31.323 --> 11:33.526
Hey, you two.

11:34.493 --> 11:37.163
Remove all the gum on the ground
in front of the gate tomorrow morning.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.070
Mr. Yang, you seem like
a real teacher right now.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.472
-You're awesome.
-Really?

12:10.129 --> 12:11.697
I'm sorry about yesterday.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.167
Is your ear okay?

12:18.704 --> 12:19.839
What do you think?

12:21.807 --> 12:23.142
Good grief.

12:25.778 --> 12:26.812
Troublemakers,

12:28.414 --> 12:31.450
what did you two do this time?

12:32.017 --> 12:33.753
What did you do?
Why are you glaring at me?

12:35.154 --> 12:37.356
This works out for me.
Do a good job, okay?

12:37.723 --> 12:39.024
We're expecting many guests today.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.560
This isn't a trash can.

12:43.395 --> 12:44.296
It is now.

13:52.865 --> 13:55.301
Hey, there. You, the cute student!
Please look this way for a second.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.143
WE GO TO THE SAME SCHOOL

14:04.210 --> 14:05.444
NO MEDIA APPEARANCES FOR OZ'S IDOLS

14:05.511 --> 14:08.180
I'LL BE STUDYING INSTEAD OF SINGING

14:08.247 --> 14:10.015
OZ ENTERTAINMENT
TAKES OVER KIRIN ART SCHOOL!

14:10.082 --> 14:12.151
LEE GANG-CHEOL
ENTERTAINMENT AGENT, SINGER

14:12.218 --> 14:15.521
As of today, all underage singers
at Oz Entertainment

14:16.555 --> 14:17.990
will cease TV and radio activities

14:18.891 --> 14:21.193
and return to school.

14:21.827 --> 14:22.895
Is this a protest

14:22.962 --> 14:25.231
against the Special Underage
Celebrity Protection Act?

14:28.133 --> 14:30.236
I'll take questions
during the Q&amp;A session.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.806
Some say that you acquired the school

14:33.873 --> 14:36.876
because the 20-class-hour rule
doesn't apply here.

14:37.509 --> 14:41.547
SUCPA is not suited to the reality
of the Korean entertainment industry.

14:42.014 --> 14:46.518
Underage celebrities will now be subjected
to even more grueling schedules,

14:46.752 --> 14:48.621
as they must do well in school
as well as their work.

14:48.954 --> 14:52.024
We realized that our teen idols
cannot keep up their normal workload.

14:53.092 --> 14:56.428
To return as better entertainers
for the many fans out there,

14:57.663 --> 14:59.732
teen idols at Oz Entertainment
will improve themselves here.

15:00.532 --> 15:04.470
We will also cultivate and support
talented future stars here at Kirin

15:05.905 --> 15:07.773
so that they can realize their dreams.

15:11.377 --> 15:14.480
You will now experience
Oz Entertainment's demanding system

15:14.546 --> 15:17.449
for training future teen stars.

15:19.018 --> 15:20.286
Students who show promise

15:20.719 --> 15:24.056
will be given a chance
to sign with Oz Entertainment.

15:25.291 --> 15:29.028
We will train hopefuls
to become full-fledged stars.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.898
Hey! Did you hear that?

15:34.266 --> 15:37.136
Yes, this means
that I might also get a chance.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.707
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

15:45.844 --> 15:50.950
Tap into your hidden passion and talent,
and make your dreams come true.

15:53.819 --> 15:55.187
This is awesome!

16:12.438 --> 16:15.507
All you have to do
is abide by a few rules and regulations.

16:16.241 --> 16:17.076
Just a few.

16:31.390 --> 16:34.493
-I've made it big, Mom.
-No cell phone usage.

16:35.627 --> 16:37.129
No Internet usage.

16:38.063 --> 16:39.698
No snacking.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.801
No dating.

16:45.838 --> 16:50.776
No holding hands
unless it's part of a dance routine.

16:53.078 --> 16:55.981
Do away with the illusion
that platonic love exists.

16:56.715 --> 16:59.051
Just say no to romance.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.394
Look at this mess.

17:12.264 --> 17:15.034
What's he doing under the piano?
No skipping class.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.102
No taking selfies. Look at that face.

17:27.913 --> 17:29.381
No playing with brooms.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.283
No jump rope. You might fall.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.385
You might hurt your back.
No physical games.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.287
No basketball. You might hurt your ankles.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.222
No nunchucks. Why do you even have this?

17:37.289 --> 17:39.992
No LP records. No comic books.
What's the point?

17:40.325 --> 17:41.960
No.

17:42.361 --> 17:43.362
No!

17:45.064 --> 17:47.633
We can't do anything.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.402
We should abide by the rules
now that we are Oz trainees.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.071
We can do this much to become singers.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.306
-Singers?
-Singers?

18:04.683 --> 18:08.353
The school is your studio,
and your dorm room is your apartment.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.456
Don't be fussy.

18:10.522 --> 18:12.157
Use this opportunity to grow as--

18:12.224 --> 18:14.827
You made this decision unilaterally
and simply notified us...

18:15.461 --> 18:17.563
Can't the agency simply notify you
of their decisions?

18:18.630 --> 18:22.401
You went to school three or four times
a month before transferring here.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.369
So, why are you overreacting?

18:26.505 --> 18:27.940
That's private information you disclosed.

18:28.474 --> 18:29.741
Privacy?

18:30.876 --> 18:33.545
Privacy applies to things
only you know about.

18:34.313 --> 18:36.915
Everyone in Korea knows
about your private life.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.718
You have no right to take issue with this.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.390
I'll get going.
I need to work on my lines.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.059
You said you wanted to play hooky.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.661
For once, you were honest
in your interview.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.930
But this is work.

18:53.165 --> 18:54.333
You don't have to work.

18:55.901 --> 18:56.735
Sorry?

18:56.935 --> 18:59.538
Suspension of all activities.
Don't you know what that means?

19:01.173 --> 19:03.208
I have to stop acting?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.611
We are almost done with filming though.

19:05.844 --> 19:08.180
You were let go anyway.

19:10.916 --> 19:11.750
What?

19:14.853 --> 19:18.157
I lost sleep to learn the sword dance
and traditional instruments

19:18.557 --> 19:20.025
because I wanted the role.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.293
Why was I let go?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.264
The director replaced you
with someone else.

19:26.965 --> 19:28.834
Who could that be?

19:29.835 --> 19:30.802
Eun-jung.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.238
He said her acting was better.

19:34.273 --> 19:35.407
Eun-jung?

19:36.308 --> 19:37.976
T-ara's Eun-jung?

19:39.845 --> 19:41.647
Has that director lost his mind?

19:48.654 --> 19:49.488
Rian.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.158
-You can't just storm out like this.
-Let go.

19:53.725 --> 19:56.595
You don't want to get into her bad books.
Let's go back in.

19:58.096 --> 20:00.532
You said you liked the uniform.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.067
Are you kidding?

20:04.069 --> 20:05.337
What a long day.

20:06.171 --> 20:07.206
Let's go clubbing.

20:07.406 --> 20:08.340
Hey!

20:10.509 --> 20:11.443
Never mind then.

20:13.645 --> 20:15.447
What a hoodlum.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.983
I wouldn't say he's a hoodlum.

20:18.483 --> 20:21.653
He's just a bit too free-spirited.

20:23.488 --> 20:24.323
What?

20:25.057 --> 20:25.891
Nothing.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.864
They're both so stubborn.

20:32.931 --> 20:35.601
No wonder all our managers
keep on quitting.

20:38.470 --> 20:41.006
This is amazing.

20:41.506 --> 20:43.875
There's something to be said
for a large entertainment agency.

20:43.942 --> 20:45.310
When did you get all this ready?

20:46.378 --> 20:47.279
Well?

20:47.346 --> 20:48.880
So, if all these things are carried out,

20:48.947 --> 20:52.184
our school will produce the next
Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga.

20:52.684 --> 20:55.654
You're saying that this school will become
the center of the Korean Wave,

20:55.721 --> 20:58.223
and kids from Europe and Japan
may want to come here, right?

20:58.557 --> 21:01.660
Enough with your sarcasm.
But you don't seem too displeased.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.595
I thought you'd hate it.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.831
What is there to love or hate?

21:06.698 --> 21:09.401
To be honest,
I thought today could be my last day here.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.203
But since you're showing me this...

21:12.504 --> 21:13.572
Are you keeping me around?

21:18.377 --> 21:20.012
What?

21:20.579 --> 21:24.016
Why would I fire you, Jeong-wan? Gosh.

21:24.416 --> 21:27.386
I should let my wife know
that I didn't get the boot.

21:28.086 --> 21:29.788
What's wrong with you?

21:30.722 --> 21:33.392
I should be the one asking for your help.

21:34.159 --> 21:36.395
You're the principal,
the head of this school.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.729
Oh, stop it.

21:37.796 --> 21:41.333
I just watched this school go downhill.
I'm no good.

21:43.669 --> 21:45.103
You'll follow my methods, right?

21:45.404 --> 21:49.174
I'll do as you say since you're paying me.
Do whatever you want to do.

21:50.942 --> 21:53.979
-Is teaching not your cup of tea?
-Principals don't teach.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.248
But I do my money's worth.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.783
That's right. I really do work hard.

21:59.851 --> 22:00.686
I'll get going.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.055
My wife was happy to hear about you.

22:06.291 --> 22:07.159
Work hard, okay?

22:08.493 --> 22:11.096
-Thank you, Director Lee.
-All right.

22:14.199 --> 22:15.801
What? What is it?

22:16.535 --> 22:19.037
-I came by just in case.
-Just in case?

22:20.072 --> 22:22.974
Our school turned into a teen idol
management agency overnight.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.344
You're the principal!

22:25.410 --> 22:26.745
Yes. I'm the principal. So?

22:27.879 --> 22:30.582
You don't like this?
The other kids seem happy.

22:30.649 --> 22:31.550
You don't like it?

22:31.616 --> 22:33.585
If you stand out, you can make your debut.

22:35.754 --> 22:38.323
You're a former rocker who delivers
fried chicken. What did I expect?

22:39.825 --> 22:41.226
What about my chicken business?

22:41.560 --> 22:43.161
Can't a former rocker
deliver fried chicken?

22:43.562 --> 22:44.496
Stop your nonsense.

22:44.996 --> 22:48.367
You need to behave
if you want your diploma.

22:48.433 --> 22:49.267
Go on.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.880
Why are there so many
rules and regulations?

23:01.947 --> 23:02.881
This isn't a law school.

23:03.281 --> 23:04.716
How are we going to remember everything?

23:05.350 --> 23:09.388
I'm sure we don't actually have to follow
all these rules.

23:09.621 --> 23:13.592
I'll follow every single one of them
just as we've been told to.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.065
What?

23:21.266 --> 23:22.501
You competitive nerd.

23:22.667 --> 23:23.635
Who? Me?

23:23.835 --> 23:25.170
You should follow the rules too.

23:30.976 --> 23:32.177
I swear.

23:32.377 --> 23:33.912
I'm the dorm supervisor.

23:34.479 --> 23:35.680
Girl group members...

23:37.015 --> 23:39.017
will be living in our dorm!

23:40.152 --> 23:43.155
Isn't it awesome?
I'm glad I held out here.

23:43.221 --> 23:44.322
Think about it.

23:44.523 --> 23:46.992
They might ask me to join them
for midnight snacks.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.895
Major announcement!

23:55.200 --> 23:56.067
Let's get ready.

23:56.301 --> 23:57.803
-For what?
-For what?

23:59.204 --> 24:01.039
To carry on the school's tradition,

24:02.240 --> 24:03.742
let's have the new student hazing party!

24:09.748 --> 24:10.649
You're back again?

24:12.717 --> 24:13.819
Give me my baby.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.694
I've been couch surfing
to save up for this moment.

24:23.094 --> 24:27.232
I never thought you would actually come
and buy the guitar.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.802
-I need this to make myself feel better.
-Here.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.308
-No one has touched this, right?
-Of course not.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.149
Open the door.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.017
Let us in while I'm being nice.

24:47.552 --> 24:49.855
Why aren't you going in?
Isn't this the dorm?

24:49.921 --> 24:50.856
They're hazing us.

24:50.922 --> 24:53.358
They won't open the door
until everyone's here.

24:53.758 --> 24:55.260
What a pain.

24:55.927 --> 24:57.295
Si-u's not here yet.

24:57.362 --> 24:58.430
Call him.

24:58.930 --> 25:00.265
He only answers phone calls from you.

25:00.465 --> 25:01.933
He's in your group.

25:04.469 --> 25:07.372
Open up! It's freezing out here.

25:07.806 --> 25:09.975
You're newbies.
Don't dream of entering the dorm

25:10.041 --> 25:11.710
unless you're all present.

25:12.711 --> 25:14.646
We're all here. Let us in.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.850
What is this? Is he stupid?

25:31.530 --> 25:33.031
Hello.

25:34.699 --> 25:39.104
Idols are here. Fresh, new idols are here.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.404
Is this not it?

28:06.084 --> 28:07.819
It looks like so much fun.

28:09.020 --> 28:09.888
Ms. Ahn.

28:10.922 --> 28:12.157
You look like a different person.

28:13.792 --> 28:16.461
I just needed a pick-me-up.

28:17.495 --> 28:19.164
What are they doing, anyway?

28:19.898 --> 28:20.999
The new student hazing party.

28:21.599 --> 28:22.967
It's our dorm tradition.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.182
What are they doing now?

31:58.983 --> 32:00.118
This is the highlight.

32:01.019 --> 32:02.553
It's the Dance and Plunder.

32:03.354 --> 32:04.188
Plunder?

32:05.323 --> 32:06.457
What are you doing?

32:06.958 --> 32:08.493
You watched the show, so pay for it.

32:08.559 --> 32:10.094
I'll give you a special discount.

32:10.161 --> 32:11.629
Three strands of hair, okay?

32:18.703 --> 32:19.604
What are you doing?

32:21.039 --> 32:22.640
What the...

32:37.922 --> 32:39.457
So what brings you here, Ms. Ahn?

32:40.458 --> 32:41.793
Didn't they tell you?

32:42.493 --> 32:44.729
They made me the dorm supervisor.

33:01.779 --> 33:03.448
It's mine!

33:03.514 --> 33:05.550
-Hey! No!
-Give it to me.

33:10.221 --> 33:11.055
You little...

33:22.033 --> 33:23.134
Hello.

33:25.069 --> 33:27.005
Hi, everyone.

33:29.774 --> 33:32.343
What are you staring at? It's just me.

33:34.846 --> 33:39.951
I'm your dorm supervisor
and vocal trainer now.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.820
My name is Ahn Tae-yeon.

33:44.389 --> 33:45.256
Nice to meet you.

33:47.291 --> 33:50.395
We don't have much time,
so I'll assign your rooms.

33:51.629 --> 33:53.264
JB will be in Room 201.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.535
Where's Si-u? You two are sharing.

33:58.202 --> 33:59.771
And where's Rian?

34:00.538 --> 34:01.406
Room 107.

34:02.006 --> 34:03.574
What? Room 107?

34:04.809 --> 34:07.278
But that's our room, Ms. Ahn.

34:09.914 --> 34:13.284
Unpack and look around, okay?

34:14.152 --> 34:14.986
Go on.

34:27.098 --> 34:28.866
There aren't enough rooms,

34:29.867 --> 34:34.072
so students with low GPAs
will be kicked out of the dorm.

34:38.009 --> 34:39.477
If I call your name,

34:41.379 --> 34:43.181
you need to move out within 15 days.

34:44.015 --> 34:47.418
Until then, we'll have
three students to a room.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.656
I'm sorry, but here goes.

34:53.825 --> 34:56.327
Park Hong-ju, Lee Na-yeong,

34:57.261 --> 34:58.196
Park Sun-dong.

35:00.431 --> 35:01.432
Me?

35:01.866 --> 35:02.767
Oh, no.

35:03.701 --> 35:04.535
Me?

35:25.356 --> 35:27.992
STUDENT RECORDS

35:36.400 --> 35:38.803
-You're the English teacher, right?
-Am I getting fired?

35:39.403 --> 35:42.073
There's a new dorm supervisor.

35:42.773 --> 35:43.808
Already?

35:45.042 --> 35:47.778
But I told them to have the new supervisor
start working tomorrow.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.915
Am I getting fired tomorrow?

35:51.215 --> 35:54.252
No, we're just relieving you
of your dorm supervisor duties.

35:54.519 --> 35:55.853
It's a load off, isn't it?

35:56.587 --> 35:57.989
I would like to keep the load, sir.

35:59.457 --> 36:01.359
You weren't doing anything all along.

36:03.628 --> 36:08.666
The kids have been misbehaving,
and the dorm is a total mess.

36:09.667 --> 36:12.537
But the kids love me.

36:16.174 --> 36:21.078
These days, kids above the age of seven
don't really like their teachers.

36:27.351 --> 36:28.753
Honorable Director Lee.

36:31.589 --> 36:32.523
I have...

36:34.759 --> 36:35.893
nowhere to go.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.900
Why don't we look at
some studio apartments in Noryangjin?

36:46.737 --> 36:50.708
Kim Tae-ho, Lee Jae-u, Jeong Ui-bong.

36:54.845 --> 36:56.681
And lastly...

36:59.717 --> 37:00.618
Shin Hae-seong.

37:02.353 --> 37:03.454
Really?

37:03.654 --> 37:05.489
Pardon? Me?

37:06.724 --> 37:08.726
Yes. I'm so sorry.

37:09.427 --> 37:12.663
There must have been
some kind of mistake, Ms. Ahn.

37:13.097 --> 37:14.966
I'm the resident assistant.

37:17.501 --> 37:18.336
So?

37:18.736 --> 37:19.570
Sorry?

37:20.037 --> 37:22.173
Isn't this based on our GPAs?

37:23.140 --> 37:25.142
As you know,

37:25.643 --> 37:27.311
I'm on the honor roll.

37:29.146 --> 37:33.184
We'll only be tabulating grades
from art classes and dorm life scores.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.252
It's practicum-oriented.

37:34.885 --> 37:36.854
But still...

37:37.221 --> 37:40.391
You're great when it comes to theory,
but your practicum scores are bad.

37:45.763 --> 37:46.664
Pardon?

37:47.331 --> 37:51.335
You got into this school
based on your middle school GPA,

37:51.402 --> 37:53.738
like how kids get into regular schools
for their artistic talent.

37:56.173 --> 38:01.545
So, I got special admission here
for my academic achievements?

38:06.951 --> 38:07.852
But that can't be.

38:09.053 --> 38:10.221
No way.

38:11.622 --> 38:12.923
You didn't know?

38:14.825 --> 38:15.793
Did I just reveal...

38:17.695 --> 38:19.964
your deep, dark secret?

38:21.465 --> 38:22.767
"Deep, dark secret"?

38:26.504 --> 38:28.339
No way.

38:29.373 --> 38:30.474
This can't be.

38:31.475 --> 38:33.477
It's not like you paid your way
into school.

38:34.011 --> 38:37.415
I passed the audition
and got into this school.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.317
I didn't get special admission
based on my high GPA.

39:11.148 --> 39:14.452
If you'd really like to stay,
you can take the rooftop apartment.

39:15.152 --> 39:17.321
I'll have the guard move out tomorrow.

39:18.255 --> 39:20.257
I have faith in you, Mr. Yang.

40:21.118 --> 40:22.653
NO ENTRY AFTER CURFEW AT 10:00 P.M.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.595
It's so cold.

40:34.565 --> 40:36.300
What high school again?

40:37.168 --> 40:38.235
Kirin Art School.

40:39.303 --> 40:40.137
Where?

40:40.438 --> 40:41.305
Kirin...

40:45.042 --> 40:46.310
It's a Foreign Language High School.

40:47.178 --> 40:49.447
Kirin Foreign Language High School?

40:50.681 --> 40:52.116
Yes, Dad.

41:02.126 --> 41:05.362
-Stop right there!
-No, Dad.

41:06.864 --> 41:07.932
Come here right now.

41:07.998 --> 41:10.768
Calm down, Dad. We're in a church.

41:12.670 --> 41:15.506
It's not a foreign language school
but an art school?

41:15.573 --> 41:17.074
I told you it was an art school.

41:18.676 --> 41:21.912
Tomorrow's the entrance ceremony.
It's your loss if you keep this up.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.248
The Lord is watching, Dad.

41:25.049 --> 41:28.185
Matthew 5:38. Violence is not condoned.

41:28.252 --> 41:30.287
Dad!

41:31.455 --> 41:32.823
I'm sorry.

41:37.061 --> 41:38.095
Dear Lord...

41:39.463 --> 41:40.297
I...

41:41.098 --> 41:43.434
really want to become a singer, Dad.

41:45.202 --> 41:46.637
You're overweight.

41:48.539 --> 41:51.775
I desperately want to become a singer.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.777
I can lose weight.

41:55.112 --> 41:56.013
Father.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.482
Dad.

41:59.817 --> 42:01.819
Father.

42:02.419 --> 42:04.121
Dad.

42:04.288 --> 42:06.624
Father.

42:06.957 --> 42:08.526
Dad.

42:18.903 --> 42:21.272
Just how great is the song
for him to write "good" on the CD?

42:26.610 --> 42:27.578
Where did it go?

42:34.018 --> 42:35.553
This is bad.

42:37.087 --> 42:38.889
It was the best of the best.
Where can it be?

42:39.990 --> 42:41.825
I know I put it in my bag.

43:49.893 --> 43:51.128
Full frontal nudity!

43:53.130 --> 43:54.264
This is so humiliating.

43:55.966 --> 43:57.434
This can't be happening.

44:02.272 --> 44:03.407
Will the word get around?

44:04.441 --> 44:05.676
Will this go up on the Internet?

44:07.911 --> 44:09.546
No.

44:10.581 --> 44:11.649
That won't happen.

44:13.283 --> 44:14.752
I can't believe this.

44:16.787 --> 44:19.390
Darn it. Why?

44:23.394 --> 44:24.361
Let's watch together.

44:27.798 --> 44:31.001
I didn't know girls
relieved their stress like this.

44:31.201 --> 44:32.770
This isn't mine. It's J...

44:33.037 --> 44:36.106
Then again, even the top student
needs to relieve her stress.

44:40.277 --> 44:41.979
Get lost while I'm being nice.

44:42.279 --> 44:44.114
I'm in no mood for games.

44:44.548 --> 44:45.649
That's no surprise.

44:46.550 --> 44:49.920
You got rejected by Oz,
your dream entertainment agency.

44:49.987 --> 44:51.455
And whose fault was it?

44:52.122 --> 44:55.459
You always show up at the critical moment
and ruin everything for me.

44:56.994 --> 44:58.829
You like belittling others, don't you?

45:00.230 --> 45:01.632
You'll suffer one day.

45:04.101 --> 45:04.968
Hey.

45:07.738 --> 45:09.740
Sleep in my spot. I've warmed it up.

45:27.458 --> 45:28.859
Hello.

45:29.159 --> 45:30.427
Hello.

45:33.831 --> 45:36.433
-Rian.
-Hello, Director.

45:36.533 --> 45:37.701
Sit down.

45:38.769 --> 45:42.539
You must have pulled an all-nighter.
I'm sorry that I showed up so early.

45:47.311 --> 45:49.079
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.984
Is that for me?

45:55.519 --> 45:57.087
For an energy boost at the set.

45:57.521 --> 45:59.623
It's red ginseng.

46:01.225 --> 46:02.593
It must have bothered you.

46:03.694 --> 46:06.029
I completely understand though.

46:06.830 --> 46:09.366
If you just let me know
what I need to work on,

46:09.433 --> 46:11.401
I'll work really hard
and fix my weaknesses.

46:11.468 --> 46:14.071
I really want to be in your movie.

46:14.138 --> 46:15.773
I've prepared so much.

46:15.839 --> 46:19.810
Shall I do the scene where I declare
that I'll kill Min Song-baek?

46:22.846 --> 46:24.348
-Rian.
-Yes?

46:24.715 --> 46:27.417
Aren't you here because you felt bad
that you pulled out at the last minute?

46:29.253 --> 46:30.087
Pardon?

46:30.287 --> 46:32.589
Your agency said
that you couldn't shoot the movie

46:32.656 --> 46:34.925
because you needed to focus on school.

46:40.097 --> 46:43.066
So, it wasn't you who gave me the boot.

46:43.300 --> 46:46.103
It was my agency that pulled me out?

46:46.537 --> 46:47.371
Yes.

46:53.944 --> 46:55.679
I'll get going.

46:55.746 --> 46:56.980
Okay.

47:07.424 --> 47:09.226
Hey, kid.

47:09.960 --> 47:10.861
Hey!

47:11.995 --> 47:15.132
How dare you sleep
in the director's office?

47:17.501 --> 47:20.904
The dorm was locked,
and it was just so cold.

47:21.772 --> 47:24.508
This was the only room with a heater,
and the door was open.

47:24.575 --> 47:26.243
So I came in for a quick snooze.

47:33.016 --> 47:34.451
The door was open?

47:34.685 --> 47:35.519
Yes.

47:59.142 --> 48:00.277
Why did you come in here?

48:00.744 --> 48:04.047
I told you it was cold.
I needed a warm place to sleep.

48:04.114 --> 48:05.315
You went through my drawers.

48:05.382 --> 48:07.551
No, all I did was turn on the heater.

48:11.588 --> 48:12.923
What year and class? What's your name?

48:12.990 --> 48:14.725
I swear I didn't touch a thing.

48:14.791 --> 48:16.627
You have the wrong person. Let go of me.

48:19.296 --> 48:21.932
Is something wrong?

48:22.132 --> 48:24.034
No. It's nothing.

48:24.101 --> 48:24.968
I see.

48:25.602 --> 48:26.470
Hey, Jin Yu-jin.

48:27.004 --> 48:28.005
Why are you here?

48:28.071 --> 48:30.274
It was cold, and I needed to sleep.

48:30.340 --> 48:32.676
You can't sleep in Mr. Lee's office
because you're cold.

48:33.043 --> 48:33.877
Come on out.

48:34.411 --> 48:35.245
Hurry.

48:36.079 --> 48:36.947
You are...

48:38.215 --> 48:40.751
Why did you come
into the director's office?

48:40.817 --> 48:41.685
Get out of here. Scat.

48:43.420 --> 48:44.288
I'm so sorry.

48:45.188 --> 48:47.190
Is something missing?

48:48.725 --> 48:49.860
I see.

48:56.033 --> 48:59.903
The document can't be made public.
Find the culprit no matter what.

49:00.804 --> 49:03.573
Could it have been Principal Ju?

49:07.744 --> 49:10.747
They kicked us out because of their idols.

49:10.914 --> 49:12.115
I curse them.

49:13.617 --> 49:17.554
Should we look for a place to live
together? Would my mom allow it?

49:18.855 --> 49:21.425
-What's this line?
-I don't know.

49:22.125 --> 49:24.394
Next. Arms open wide.

49:26.029 --> 49:26.930
Pass.

49:27.531 --> 49:31.635
Turn in your cell phones, cameras,
and other recording devices.

49:32.235 --> 49:33.971
Next. Pass.

49:34.338 --> 49:36.840
Next student. Spread your arms out wide.

49:37.808 --> 49:39.042
Good. Pass.

49:39.609 --> 49:40.510
Next.

49:41.411 --> 49:44.281
-All right.
-I didn't think they would really do this.

49:44.348 --> 49:45.916
-Technology can't beat me.
-Spread your arms.

49:51.455 --> 49:52.823
Cell phone.

49:53.190 --> 49:54.524
I don't have it on me.

49:56.693 --> 49:58.228
I know it's in your bra.

49:59.062 --> 50:01.264
I don't know what you're talking about.

50:01.665 --> 50:03.934
-Should I remove the phone here?
-Ms. Ahn!

50:04.868 --> 50:06.003
I'll be right back.

50:08.905 --> 50:11.641
-Next.
-I'm Shin Hae-seong, a senior.

50:13.710 --> 50:15.412
-Pass.
-Okay.

50:40.637 --> 50:42.973
-Please accept my gift!
-Here, take mine.

50:43.206 --> 50:45.776
Line up!

50:49.346 --> 50:50.680
Let me add it to the list.

50:52.015 --> 50:54.418
Thanks for the present.

50:55.085 --> 50:57.020
Don't let anyone steal it from you.

50:57.921 --> 51:00.424
Keep it in a safe place.

51:01.391 --> 51:02.859
Okay.

51:06.763 --> 51:07.597
Oh, and...

51:27.184 --> 51:28.018
Mr. Lee.

51:28.852 --> 51:30.187
Don't you have class?

51:30.854 --> 51:32.989
You said I would be a good actress.

51:33.690 --> 51:36.026
You said debuting as a singer
would help me build my acting career.

51:36.793 --> 51:37.894
I trusted you.

51:38.228 --> 51:39.830
I learned to sing and dance.

51:39.896 --> 51:41.298
I did gigs on little or no sleep.

51:42.532 --> 51:44.067
I did everything you asked.

51:45.168 --> 51:48.205
So let me do acting like you promised.

51:48.572 --> 51:50.240
Did you do the gigs for free?

51:51.741 --> 51:54.978
I pulled you out
because your acting was so bad.

51:55.579 --> 51:59.282
You don't give me time to learn the lines
or get into my scenes.

51:59.349 --> 52:00.617
How can I deliver good acting?

52:02.853 --> 52:05.755
Can't you see how much effort I put in
to reorganize your schedule

52:05.822 --> 52:08.091
so that you can do acting?

52:10.827 --> 52:12.329
Help me become a good actress.

52:12.796 --> 52:14.197
Not at this stupid school.

52:14.931 --> 52:16.399
Find me a good acting coach.

52:21.271 --> 52:22.439
"This stupid school"?

53:27.237 --> 53:28.305
Stop!

53:30.373 --> 53:31.708
What have they been teaching you?

53:33.143 --> 53:34.077
You.

53:34.611 --> 53:36.680
You just stood there
doing absolutely nothing.

53:37.347 --> 53:40.083
They probably know this routine by heart.
But it's a first for the rest of us.

53:40.350 --> 53:41.451
How are we supposed to keep up?

53:41.718 --> 53:43.153
They've never done this routine before.

53:43.887 --> 53:45.889
It's a simple routine.
You should be able to pick it up.

53:47.090 --> 53:49.626
You struggling,
despite being a senior at this school,

53:49.693 --> 53:51.695
tells me that you haven't been
working hard enough.

53:51.761 --> 53:53.263
Do you have to dance to be a singer?

53:56.566 --> 53:58.435
Do kids who want to major
in Korean literature

53:58.835 --> 54:00.036
study nothing else but that?

54:01.137 --> 54:03.940
Zip it and work up a sweat.

54:05.108 --> 54:09.112
Until you sweat out a liter each
from dancing,

54:09.179 --> 54:11.047
don't even dream of taking my class.

54:12.415 --> 54:14.718
I'm only asking that you get the basics.

54:18.054 --> 54:20.123
I'm telling you to leave right now.

54:20.824 --> 54:22.058
Do you not understand?

54:23.526 --> 54:25.795
If your bodies are slow,
be quick with your heads.

54:26.229 --> 54:27.964
You're disrupting the class. Get out.

54:32.802 --> 54:33.737
JB.

54:35.038 --> 54:36.606
Everyone else, follow JB's lead.

56:21.378 --> 56:24.914
"List of candidates for expulsion.

56:26.816 --> 56:27.650
Si-u.

56:28.651 --> 56:30.620
Bad attitude. Out of control."

56:32.889 --> 56:33.723
Me?

56:37.527 --> 56:38.695
I knew it.

56:42.699 --> 56:43.666
I knew...

56:45.869 --> 56:47.137
that this would be my grave.

56:52.175 --> 56:53.510
You're a jerk.

56:55.311 --> 56:56.212
Don't do it.

56:58.381 --> 56:59.349
Don't.

57:00.316 --> 57:02.585
It was just dancing.

57:10.627 --> 57:11.661
Idiot.

57:21.337 --> 57:22.372
What did you say?

57:25.308 --> 57:28.011
I've had enough of you.
Why don't you get lost?

57:29.512 --> 57:31.181
Stop getting in the way.

57:33.049 --> 57:34.851
I can't focus on practice

57:36.886 --> 57:38.188
in my studio.

57:42.058 --> 57:43.059
Your studio?

57:43.660 --> 57:44.494
Yes.

57:45.895 --> 57:46.830
My studio.

1:00:28.925 --> 1:00:30.860
Have you ever watched Dances with Wolves?

1:00:30.927 --> 1:00:34.197
-Why do you ask?
-The bad guys invade a peaceful village

1:00:34.263 --> 1:00:36.265
-and steal houses and land.
-So?

1:00:36.332 --> 1:00:39.435
That's exactly what's happening
in our dorm.

1:00:40.069 --> 1:00:43.439
So, you're the indigenous people,
and I'm the bad guy?

1:00:43.506 --> 1:00:45.708
I'll let you have a go at it.
Do you think you can win?

1:00:45.775 --> 1:00:49.178
The end-of-the-month evaluation
will be comparable to a showcase.

1:00:49.245 --> 1:00:51.014
Don't let your guard down.
Practice diligently.

1:00:51.080 --> 1:00:54.617
Whoever picks Park Hong-ju
will come out on top at the evaluation.

1:00:54.684 --> 1:00:56.319
-I bid of 20 meal tickets.
-I bid ten more.

1:00:56.386 --> 1:00:58.054
-I bid 50 meal tickets.
-May I join the bid?

1:00:58.287 --> 1:00:59.589
I'll wager my voice.

1:01:03.426 --> 1:01:04.260
Thank you.

1:01:05.094 --> 1:01:06.462
Is that it?

1:01:06.696 --> 1:01:08.364
I don't sing for just anyone.

1:01:08.431 --> 1:01:11.434
-Leave.
-Am I just anyone?

1:01:11.501 --> 1:01:12.568
Look! It's JB!

1:01:13.603 --> 1:01:15.872
You ruined my performance.
You call that "having some fun"?

1:01:16.039 --> 1:01:18.074
I wanted you to know I'm not just anyone.

1:01:18.274 --> 1:01:19.308
Forget it.

1:01:20.610 --> 1:01:23.279
Hey, what are you doing?

1:01:24.013 --> 1:01:25.748
Don't get yourself involved.

1:01:25.815 --> 1:01:27.050
Isn't he in your group?
