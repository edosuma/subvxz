00:43.761 --> 00:47.965
Do you know what it's
like to love someone?

00:48.032 --> 00:50.768
It's like no matter
where they are

00:52.636 --> 00:54.671
you can still feel their touch.

02:04.242 --> 02:05.375
Sofia?

02:16.519 --> 02:17.989
You all right?

02:18.055 --> 02:20.024
What if it never happens?

02:20.091 --> 02:21.625
We'll be okay.

02:21.691 --> 02:22.726
How do you know?

02:22.793 --> 02:24.829
I'm trying to be positive.

02:26.696 --> 02:28.132
What else can I do?

02:28.199 --> 02:29.666
We have to keep trying.

02:31.534 --> 02:33.204
I told you, I can't help
if I'm not in the mood.

02:33.271 --> 02:34.704
I'm not having a go.

02:36.874 --> 02:38.608
It'll be fine.

02:38.675 --> 02:39.810
I promise.

02:40.778 --> 02:41.678
Promise.

02:43.180 --> 02:44.081
You remember?

02:53.257 --> 02:54.158
United

02:55.558 --> 02:56.626
by lodestone.

02:59.864 --> 03:02.699
A permanent
symbol of our love.

03:02.767 --> 03:03.768
Permanent.

03:06.837 --> 03:08.638
Would it be different
if you could take it off?

03:08.705 --> 03:09.739
Of course not.

03:12.877 --> 03:13.778
I know.

03:22.853 --> 03:25.655
Is that a magnet?

03:25.722 --> 03:27.224
Fancy, isn't it?

03:29.592 --> 03:31.162
I had one when I was a boy.

03:34.899 --> 03:36.666
Oh, sorry.

03:42.273 --> 03:44.607
Crazy to think that it
comes from the earth.

03:47.244 --> 03:48.279
What
is it you want

03:48.346 --> 03:49.546
to talk about today, Jamie?

03:51.816 --> 03:52.817
Where do I begin?

03:57.755 --> 04:01.325
Are
things not going well?

04:01.392 --> 04:03.094
I don't know.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.895
I mean, no.

04:04.962 --> 04:06.163
Things are okay.

04:08.833 --> 04:09.900
You can
talk about anything

04:09.967 --> 04:11.568
in my office, Jamie.

04:16.841 --> 04:17.741
I love her.

04:19.877 --> 04:21.979
I do everything I
can to make it work.

04:23.781 --> 04:24.714
But?

04:26.649 --> 04:27.918
There are just some things.

04:30.321 --> 04:32.823
Is it to do
with Sofia's nationality?

04:34.724 --> 04:36.593
What do you mean?

04:36.659 --> 04:38.262
If she
knew that she could

04:38.329 --> 04:40.264
become a national citizen
when she married you.

05:17.468 --> 05:19.736
Shouldn't let him
touch you like that.

05:19.804 --> 05:21.038
You think I haven't tried?

05:22.940 --> 05:23.974
How is your husband?

05:25.242 --> 05:25.976
We're fine.

05:28.279 --> 05:29.280
I asked about him.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.782
He's good.

05:31.849 --> 05:32.749
Good.

05:32.817 --> 05:33.784
Oh, I like that.

05:35.419 --> 05:36.719
You pregnant yet?

05:37.855 --> 05:39.423
What's it your business?

05:39.490 --> 05:41.325
You seemed awful close
to my husband in there.

05:41.392 --> 05:46.596
You think I want that?

05:51.001 --> 05:52.803
You have to remember

05:52.870 --> 05:54.704
you're only in this country
because of your husband.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.807
I married my husband
because I loved him.

05:56.874 --> 05:57.942
Loved?

05:58.008 --> 05:59.376
You don't love Neil?

05:59.443 --> 06:00.344
Oh, well.

06:01.979 --> 06:04.315
I think I was married
the last time I checked.

06:05.416 --> 06:06.317
This a holiday?

06:11.755 --> 06:13.757
Come on, you've got
customers to serve.

06:20.097 --> 06:22.366
So, just to recap, you
want to repeat compressions

06:22.433 --> 06:26.403
about 30 times at a rate of
about 120 beats per minute.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.240
Now, has anybody dealt
with this before?

06:29.306 --> 06:30.341
No?

06:30.407 --> 06:31.708
Can I have an assistant?

06:33.444 --> 06:34.311
You?

06:35.913 --> 06:37.714
Great, take a seat.

06:37.781 --> 06:39.850
Now, obviously the patient
would be laying down

06:39.917 --> 06:42.353
at this point, but for
the purposes of the class,

06:42.419 --> 06:43.821
you're gonna be sitting up.

06:46.457 --> 06:48.658
Now, can anybody
tell me what this is?

06:49.560 --> 06:50.761
Defibrillator?

06:50.828 --> 06:52.263
Yes, that's right.

06:52.329 --> 06:55.266
An AED, an automatic
external defibrillator.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.834
Now, it's set to training mode,

06:56.901 --> 06:58.369
so it won't hurt, I promise.

06:59.970 --> 07:01.939
Now, you just follow the steps.

07:02.006 --> 07:05.708
You remove the pads, and
you attach the wires.

07:07.378 --> 07:11.415
The first pad is located just
under the right collarbone,

07:11.482 --> 07:14.385
above the breast on
the right-hand side.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.755
Obviously, the patient would be

07:17.821 --> 07:19.490
without a shirt at this point,

07:19.557 --> 07:21.792
but that's not the sort of
class we're running here.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.032
And the next pad is
located just on the ribs

07:28.966 --> 07:30.434
on the left-hand side.

07:30.501 --> 07:31.969
And the idea is that
the shock travels

07:32.036 --> 07:33.904
through the heart
instead of over it.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.109
Now, at that point you
turn the machine on.

07:41.045 --> 07:42.813
Shock advised.

07:44.915 --> 07:46.383
And then you make
sure that neither

07:46.450 --> 07:48.718
or anybody else are
touching the patient.

07:50.020 --> 07:52.823
Stay
clear of the patient.

07:53.524 --> 07:54.491
Charging.

07:58.862 --> 08:00.798
Deliver shock now.

08:00.864 --> 08:04.134
Press the orange button now.

08:04.201 --> 08:06.736
And then you press the
button to deliver the shock.

08:09.540 --> 08:11.475
There we go, that
wasn't too bad, was it?

08:11.542 --> 08:12.476
Thanks very much.

08:48.579 --> 08:50.014
Not tonight.

08:50.080 --> 08:50.981
What is it?

08:51.915 --> 08:52.783
Nothing.

08:57.154 --> 08:58.455
Maybe it isn't working.

09:00.691 --> 09:02.192
You're overreacting.

09:02.259 --> 09:04.194
So what is it then?

09:04.261 --> 09:05.896
I'm just tired.

09:06.697 --> 09:07.798
Really?

09:10.601 --> 09:11.468
Jamie.

09:12.503 --> 09:13.237
I love you.

09:17.074 --> 09:19.109
Just tell me
what's on your mind.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.082
I just don't feel good

09:27.117 --> 09:29.119
about pregnancy.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.522
All this pressure.

09:32.623 --> 09:33.490
I'm sorry.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.628
Jamie, it isn't you.

09:37.695 --> 09:38.595
Trust me.

09:47.071 --> 09:48.272
I wanna go back.

09:51.175 --> 09:54.211
We've made a life here
together, in the city.

09:54.278 --> 09:56.280
We've got this
place, we're safe.

09:57.247 --> 09:58.515
I'm tired of safe.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.965
This
union has expired.

10:16.633 --> 10:20.137
You must now find a new
partner to conceive with.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.206
Removal of the band
is not advised.

10:26.677 --> 10:27.578
Sofia.

10:36.019 --> 10:37.187
Morning, you.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.592
What are you doing?

10:47.297 --> 10:49.099
I can't touch you.

10:56.140 --> 11:00.010
This
union has expired.

11:00.077 --> 11:03.013
You must now find a new
partner to conceive with.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.016
Removal of the band
is not advised.

11:08.719 --> 11:09.620
Expired?

11:12.122 --> 11:12.990
It's over.

11:13.056 --> 11:13.991
No.

11:14.057 --> 11:15.259
It's a mistake.

11:15.325 --> 11:17.060
There's nothing
wrong with our union.

11:18.128 --> 11:19.329
I'm not safe here anymore.

11:19.396 --> 11:20.998
What do you mean?

11:21.064 --> 11:22.299
I'm not a national
citizen, Jamie.

11:22.366 --> 11:24.101
You've been here five years.

11:24.168 --> 11:25.335
What are they going to do?

11:30.073 --> 11:33.343
Look, we keep it to ourselves
until we can fix it.

11:36.647 --> 11:38.315
Find a new partner
to conceive with.

11:38.382 --> 11:40.017
That's
not gonna happen.

11:40.083 --> 11:41.185
What about last night?

11:42.619 --> 11:44.121
I'm still here.

11:44.188 --> 11:45.289
We'll get through this.

11:51.695 --> 11:55.365
Let's just go to
work and stay calm.

11:59.369 --> 12:01.773
We can't let anyone see
these while they're red.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.240
They'll ask questions.

12:04.374 --> 12:06.043
Then hide it in your sleeve.

12:07.344 --> 12:08.712
Here.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.292
How does it work?

12:23.795 --> 12:25.462
It's
a magnet, Sofia.

12:27.130 --> 12:29.666
I know that, but how
does this one work?

12:32.669 --> 12:35.205
Electromagnetic suspension.

12:35.272 --> 12:38.275
It allows any object to
remain at a constant distance.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.679
Like attraction and repulsion?

12:44.448 --> 12:47.184
It's a natural
property in magnetites.

12:48.151 --> 12:50.220
Speaking of attraction,

12:50.287 --> 12:52.256
how are you and your
partner getting along?

12:52.322 --> 12:53.223
Fine.

12:54.759 --> 12:58.228
I mean, he doesn't
know I'm here, but...

12:59.696 --> 13:00.832
Then
how can I help?

13:00.899 --> 13:03.433
There must be something
you want to talk about.

13:05.469 --> 13:06.804
Nothing too serious.

13:09.874 --> 13:12.777
Mrs. Cooper,
I know this is hard,

13:12.844 --> 13:15.245
but please remember that
this is confidential.

13:18.315 --> 13:19.182
Okay.

13:20.852 --> 13:25.188
Well, we're trying
to have a baby and...

13:27.291 --> 13:28.725
And
how is that going?

13:29.726 --> 13:30.661
I wasn't finished.

13:32.262 --> 13:33.798
My
apologies Sofia, go on.

13:38.468 --> 13:39.369
I love him.

13:41.204 --> 13:43.775
I want to have a
child, but I'm worried.

13:45.009 --> 13:46.778
You know
these things take time.

13:48.345 --> 13:49.346
What if we can't?

13:50.447 --> 13:52.149
Isn't that what's expected?

13:52.215 --> 13:53.183
To have children?

13:54.484 --> 13:55.920
The
purpose of a union

13:55.987 --> 13:57.822
is just to love
one another, Sofia.

13:59.389 --> 14:00.290
Are you happy?

14:01.358 --> 14:02.292
Yes.

14:02.359 --> 14:03.360
Yes, I'm happy.

14:05.362 --> 14:08.165
Is that not why
you've married your husband?

14:08.231 --> 14:09.232
Of course.

14:12.804 --> 14:14.371
Are you
also aware that the union

14:14.438 --> 14:16.874
is what keeps you
in this country?

14:16.941 --> 14:18.943
After they closed the borders.

14:19.010 --> 14:20.143
I don't see how
that's relevant.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.415
Do you think
your husband is happy?

14:26.516 --> 14:28.218
What's that supposed to mean?

14:37.527 --> 14:39.363
Now, when somebody's
life is at risk,

14:39.429 --> 14:41.531
we do the best that we can do.

14:41.598 --> 14:43.433
Now, hopefully none
of you will ever have

14:43.500 --> 14:45.535
to face a situation like this,
but that's why we're here.

14:45.602 --> 14:46.603
Just in case.

14:48.006 --> 14:50.875
So the recovery position
is used to ensure

14:50.942 --> 14:52.743
that a person's
airway is kept clear

14:52.810 --> 14:54.444
when they're unconscious.

14:54.511 --> 14:56.380
So I'd like you all
to give it a go.

14:56.446 --> 14:57.481
So if we pair up.

15:11.863 --> 15:12.596
No partner?

15:13.563 --> 15:14.999
Does it look like it?

15:15.066 --> 15:16.633
Okay,
I'll be the patient.

15:20.838 --> 15:23.507
Okay, so check
for dangers, no danger.

15:24.942 --> 15:26.878
Oh, someone's living
the single life.

15:28.378 --> 15:29.446
Not really.

15:33.316 --> 15:35.285
Do you mind if I
ask you something

15:35.352 --> 15:36.821
after the session today?

15:36.888 --> 15:39.256
No, I've got to
run after this.

15:39.322 --> 15:40.557
It's just a medical question.

15:40.624 --> 15:42.359
Can it
wait till next time?

15:43.061 --> 15:43.961
Yeah, okay.

15:45.429 --> 15:46.831
What have you forgotten?

15:46.898 --> 15:47.899
Breathing.

15:57.374 --> 15:58.341
Excuse me, madam.

15:59.110 --> 16:00.277
How does this work?

16:05.415 --> 16:07.018
It's magnetic.

16:07.085 --> 16:08.452
They repel
each other, no?

16:20.064 --> 16:21.565
You forgot the knife.

16:21.631 --> 16:22.632
Of course.

16:53.965 --> 16:55.365
How long?

16:55.432 --> 16:56.333
What?

16:57.201 --> 16:59.436
You know what happens, right?

16:59.503 --> 17:01.404
Please don't tell
him about this.

17:01.471 --> 17:03.040
Oh, I don't have to.

17:03.107 --> 17:04.108
You'll be gone before long.

17:04.175 --> 17:05.442
What do you mean?

17:06.676 --> 17:08.512
It's expired, hasn't it?

17:08.578 --> 17:10.047
You're an illegal citizen now.

17:10.114 --> 17:12.282
There's a problem, but
we're getting it fixed.

17:14.551 --> 17:16.620
Before long it's
gonna be goodbye house,

17:16.686 --> 17:18.555
goodbye job, goodbye...

17:18.622 --> 17:20.357
My husband and I are living
together and happy, thank you.

17:20.423 --> 17:21.893
And I'm good at my job.

17:21.959 --> 17:22.894
But you don't touch.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.494
Are you happy with that?

17:24.561 --> 17:26.596
Who says we can't touch?

17:26.663 --> 17:30.467
10 days you've got
till they take you.

17:30.534 --> 17:32.602
I don't understand.

17:32.669 --> 17:35.572
Look, I saw it
with my last husband.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.110
They watched him,
they followed him,

17:39.177 --> 17:41.145
then he just disappeared.

17:41.212 --> 17:43.713
I told him he needed to
go and find somebody else.

17:45.582 --> 17:46.616
He didn't listen to me.

17:46.683 --> 17:48.451
I won't let that happen.

17:49.519 --> 17:50.988
You need to meet someone soon.

17:53.557 --> 17:55.358
Must be so easy
for you, right?

18:13.610 --> 18:17.681
Do you think
your husband is happy?

18:20.785 --> 18:22.485
What's that supposed to mean?

18:24.088 --> 18:25.555
Both partners
should be fulfilled

18:25.622 --> 18:26.824
and happy in a union.

18:30.627 --> 18:33.630
I told him sometimes
I'm just not in the mood.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.599
Do you
feel under pressure?

18:36.633 --> 18:38.401
No relationship is perfect.

18:39.270 --> 18:40.771
You're right.

18:40.838 --> 18:42.807
I'm merely suggesting
an aspect of a union.

18:44.641 --> 18:45.776
What's another aspect?

18:48.045 --> 18:50.447
Most couples
have five years now

18:50.513 --> 18:51.514
to have children.

18:52.682 --> 18:53.683
And if they can't?

18:55.753 --> 18:59.389
They have to
try again with someone else.

19:00.224 --> 19:01.792
Things work quicker that way.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.100
What's the matter?

19:13.204 --> 19:14.437
Sorry, I...

19:16.274 --> 19:17.574
I have to go, can I go?

19:19.210 --> 19:21.178
You are free
to leave at any point, Sofia,

19:21.245 --> 19:22.880
but you did request an hour.

19:33.758 --> 19:34.825
Why did you come here?

19:55.712 --> 19:56.814
10 days?

19:56.881 --> 19:57.848
- Where did you hear that?
- Work.

19:57.915 --> 19:59.116
Lucy told me.

19:59.183 --> 20:00.217
Sofia, stop listening to her.

20:00.284 --> 20:01.786
She's trying to bring you down.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.220
I know.

20:03.287 --> 20:05.122
But she said it happened
to her ex husband.

20:05.189 --> 20:07.792
They watched him, followed
him, and then he disappeared.

20:07.858 --> 20:09.160
I don't even know when
they start counting,

20:09.226 --> 20:10.328
what if it's begun?

20:10.394 --> 20:12.196
Well, if it's true,
then we don't have long.

20:12.263 --> 20:13.730
You think I don't see that?

20:15.632 --> 20:18.269
Remember what I
said about our union.

20:18.336 --> 20:19.837
That I'd stay with
you no matter what.

20:24.208 --> 20:24.942
United

20:26.377 --> 20:27.544
by lodestone.

20:38.289 --> 20:39.323
Are you happy?

20:39.390 --> 20:40.724
You need to stop asking that.

20:40.791 --> 20:42.692
It's a fair question.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.627
Do you think I would have
left my country if I wasn't?

20:58.242 --> 20:59.509
Let's go home.

21:01.178 --> 21:01.946
And do what?

21:10.955 --> 21:13.590
Care
to restore my memory?

21:13.656 --> 21:16.659
Remember, this is
purely confidential.

21:27.304 --> 21:28.773
She wants a child,

21:30.207 --> 21:31.242
but it's not working.

21:33.377 --> 21:35.179
She says it's biological,

21:35.246 --> 21:36.914
but I'm starting to think
it's something else.

21:38.349 --> 21:39.784
What
might that be?

21:41.452 --> 21:44.321
Like she doesn't want
to sleep with me anymore.

21:44.388 --> 21:46.157
I don't know why I say that.

21:46.223 --> 21:48.591
This could
be a serious issue.

21:49.927 --> 21:51.762
When two people are
not communicating

21:51.829 --> 21:53.898
or fulfilling each
other's needs properly.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.301
It's not about needs.

21:58.402 --> 21:59.537
We're doing fine.

22:00.337 --> 22:01.338
I still love her.

22:02.873 --> 22:04.308
Are you afraid

22:04.375 --> 22:05.575
of what might happen
if you lose her?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.936
What are you doing?

22:32.002 --> 22:33.270
It's not gonna work.

22:37.740 --> 22:39.742
You'll just have
to meet someone else.

22:41.812 --> 22:44.081
What happened to staying
together no matter what?

22:47.750 --> 22:49.353
Maybe it's
not what you want.

22:51.922 --> 22:53.357
What do you mean?

22:53.424 --> 22:54.624
Is it what you want?

22:56.760 --> 22:57.694
Look at me.

22:59.063 --> 23:00.630
Jamie, please look at me.

23:04.335 --> 23:05.735
I know we've had problems.

23:07.905 --> 23:09.306
I want to be with you.

23:11.442 --> 23:12.642
I don't like this.

23:13.911 --> 23:17.882
Seeing you give up like
you don't trust us anymore.

23:21.785 --> 23:23.053
This is out of our hands.

23:24.488 --> 23:26.423
They know what they're doing.

23:26.490 --> 23:28.325
We're not allowed
to love anymore.

23:51.081 --> 23:54.752
If I knew this would happen,
I never would have married.

23:54.818 --> 23:56.020
You don't mean that.

23:58.389 --> 23:59.689
You know what I mean.

24:00.991 --> 24:01.926
This stupid thing.

24:24.615 --> 24:29.153
Do you, Jamie Cooper, take
Sofia Costa in this union,

24:32.089 --> 24:34.358
united by lodestone?

24:44.602 --> 24:45.803
I do.

25:21.138 --> 25:22.139
Lodestone.

25:35.619 --> 25:36.887
Hold out your hand.

25:46.930 --> 25:48.866
It's like a magnetic field.

26:05.049 --> 26:08.419
What if they created
it to only work

26:08.485 --> 26:09.553
against another of its kind.

26:11.522 --> 26:13.891
How does that
help us get rid of them?

26:15.159 --> 26:16.827
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

26:18.095 --> 26:18.996
I know.

26:21.498 --> 26:23.200
I know.

26:34.311 --> 26:35.946
Are you
also aware that the union

26:36.013 --> 26:38.015
is what keeps you
in this country?

26:54.631 --> 26:55.966
Do you fancy a drink?

26:59.737 --> 27:02.139
Can't ignore
customers like that.

27:02.206 --> 27:03.173
He tried to touch me.

27:03.240 --> 27:04.608
Don't be stupid.

27:06.043 --> 27:08.545
You're back on the market now.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.695
You told him.

27:24.763 --> 27:26.630
He was gonna find
out eventually.

27:26.697 --> 27:28.599
I'm not responsible for
your husband's actions.

27:28.665 --> 27:30.134
He was trying to tell me...

27:30.200 --> 27:32.102
You dare talk
about my husband.

27:32.169 --> 27:34.905
We'll both be smiling when
you step out of our lives.

28:19.750 --> 28:22.152
I'm trying to find
a clause about expiry

28:22.219 --> 28:23.620
in our marriage certificate.

28:27.759 --> 28:29.193
What's the hurry?

28:29.259 --> 28:30.093
Look.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.061
Out the window.

28:35.132 --> 28:36.366
What am I looking for?

28:37.367 --> 28:38.335
Two men.

28:42.306 --> 28:43.373
Are you sure?

28:44.374 --> 28:46.076
It's happening.

28:46.143 --> 28:47.812
They're coming for me.

28:47.879 --> 28:50.280
Well, how do you
know they're following you?

28:50.347 --> 28:51.648
I saw them after work.

28:52.817 --> 28:53.952
They kept their distance.

28:54.017 --> 28:56.754
I had to stay late, but
they still followed me.

28:58.188 --> 29:00.324
Who are they?

29:00.390 --> 29:02.426
This is exactly what
Lucy told me about.

29:05.162 --> 29:06.396
I won't let them get you.

29:08.432 --> 29:10.133
We have to get out of here.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.668
Well, where exactly?

29:11.735 --> 29:12.770
I don't know.

29:12.837 --> 29:14.137
We can't leave the city.

29:21.678 --> 29:23.280
You'll have to
meet someone else.

29:25.682 --> 29:26.717
Are you giving up?

29:26.784 --> 29:27.684
Well, it is the only way.

29:28.485 --> 29:29.686
We can't be together?

29:29.754 --> 29:31.221
They'll stop following you.

29:31.288 --> 29:32.857
It'll buy us more time.

29:42.867 --> 29:44.301
Do we have another option?

29:45.702 --> 29:47.839
This
union has expired.

29:47.906 --> 29:50.474
You must now find a new
partner to conceive with.

29:52.175 --> 29:53.878
So we give into
what they want?

30:04.321 --> 30:05.790
Do you trust me?

30:16.233 --> 30:17.401
Are you
afraid of what might happen

30:17.467 --> 30:18.335
if you lose her?

30:23.507 --> 30:25.342
You're suggesting
that I move on.

30:27.210 --> 30:29.413
It is
simply a possibility.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.715
You would be free.

30:31.783 --> 30:34.284
What greater thing in life
is there than freedom?

30:35.853 --> 30:37.755
Well, I wouldn't.

30:37.822 --> 30:39.389
What?

30:39.456 --> 30:40.357
Move on.

31:15.927 --> 31:17.260
There you are.

31:17.327 --> 31:19.196
You were late yesterday.

31:19.262 --> 31:21.766
Neil isn't happy
with you, you know?

31:44.554 --> 31:45.455
Sofia.

31:46.924 --> 31:48.358
Do we need to talk
about something?

31:48.425 --> 31:49.894
I'm sorry I was late.

31:49.961 --> 31:51.461
Everything just
caught up with me.

31:53.363 --> 31:54.766
I know it's hard,

31:54.832 --> 31:55.867
what you're going
through and everything,

31:55.933 --> 31:57.367
but you should see
it as an opportunity.

31:57.434 --> 31:58.870
You know, the single life.

31:58.936 --> 31:59.871
Okay, I'll try.

32:03.340 --> 32:04.441
I can help, you know.

32:09.312 --> 32:11.515
You need to make up for
that hour yesterday.

32:11.581 --> 32:12.784
I can't.

32:12.850 --> 32:14.317
I will tomorrow, I promise.

32:14.384 --> 32:15.485
I've got to meet my husband.

32:15.552 --> 32:16.453
Your husband?

32:18.321 --> 32:20.223
I should get back
to the customers.

32:25.328 --> 32:28.265
So your brain instructs your
stomach to expel the contents

32:28.331 --> 32:30.300
so that the blood and
energy could be spent

32:30.367 --> 32:33.403
protecting those vital organs,
as opposed to your stomach.

32:33.470 --> 32:34.939
That is so perfect.

32:35.006 --> 32:36.473
Yeah, so that's
the way it works.

32:36.540 --> 32:37.809
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah, it's good.

32:37.875 --> 32:39.309
- I know.
- The brain's amazing.

32:39.376 --> 32:40.510
- I know, it's fascinating.
- Hey.

32:40.577 --> 32:41.478
Hey.

32:44.882 --> 32:46.216
I'll head off then.

32:50.687 --> 32:51.989
Who's your friend?

32:52.056 --> 32:53.557
She had a medical question.

32:53.623 --> 32:54.624
Medical question?

32:55.692 --> 32:56.961
Do we have time for this?

32:59.362 --> 33:00.898
What's your idea?

33:25.555 --> 33:26.958
I can't go back to work.

33:28.391 --> 33:29.292
They found out.

33:30.460 --> 33:31.495
This is too much now.

33:32.930 --> 33:34.731
One of the customers
tried to touch me and...

33:43.707 --> 33:44.674
What are you doing?

33:46.110 --> 33:47.912
I figured if it's
electromagnetic,

33:47.979 --> 33:50.480
we can overpower it somehow.

33:56.954 --> 33:57.687
No.

33:58.622 --> 34:00.024
No way.

34:00.091 --> 34:01.025
I'll guide
you through it.

34:01.092 --> 34:02.894
I'm not doing this.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.061
I'm doing it.

34:16.540 --> 34:18.976
This is stupid, get up.

34:19.043 --> 34:20.510
Do we have another choice?

34:30.154 --> 34:31.055
Take the machine.

34:33.723 --> 34:36.393
Press the button, and
follow the instructions.

34:36.459 --> 34:37.394
Couldn't it kill you?

34:37.460 --> 34:38.628
It won't.

34:51.508 --> 34:53.476
Do
not touch the patient.

34:56.047 --> 34:56.781
Jamie.

34:58.481 --> 35:00.584
Shock advised.

35:00.650 --> 35:02.419
I love you.

35:02.485 --> 35:03.687
Charging,

35:05.756 --> 35:07.357
Stay clear of the patient.

35:11.494 --> 35:13.463
Deliver shock now.

35:13.530 --> 35:15.766
Press the orange button now.

35:19.636 --> 35:22.639
Why
did you come here?

35:24.608 --> 35:27.377
What did you mean by my
marriage keeping me safe?

35:29.780 --> 35:31.615
So long
as you are a loving,

35:31.681 --> 35:35.619
procreating couple, you
have nothing to worry about.

35:35.685 --> 35:37.387
Yes, yes, I know.

35:39.257 --> 35:40.423
But what can happen

35:42.059 --> 35:44.095
to couples that don't
work for whatever reason?

35:46.529 --> 35:49.166
Do not trouble
yourself with these questions.

35:50.201 --> 35:52.069
I am here to fix your problems.

35:54.839 --> 35:57.540
Is there anything else you
would like to talk about?

36:03.214 --> 36:05.149
I just want an example.

36:05.216 --> 36:09.086
Like if it doesn't work out,
do they get rid of these?

36:10.687 --> 36:11.621
We would say

36:11.688 --> 36:15.126
that their relationship
has expired.

36:18.695 --> 36:20.097
What?

36:20.164 --> 36:21.165
Like a fish?

36:22.233 --> 36:23.267
It only happens

36:23.334 --> 36:25.535
if both partners' needs
have not been met.

36:27.305 --> 36:28.205
Needs.

36:29.273 --> 36:30.174
For men?

36:31.641 --> 36:33.778
For both partners.

36:33.844 --> 36:36.613
Are you worried about
something, Sofia?

36:36.680 --> 36:40.117
I'm just wondering why no
one told us about this expiry.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.122
Are you afraid

36:45.189 --> 36:46.123
of what might happen
in the future?

36:47.724 --> 36:48.591
Afraid?

36:53.264 --> 36:54.932
I know I'll never
truly lose him.

36:58.202 --> 36:59.602
How do you mean?

37:02.873 --> 37:04.775
Do you know what
it's like to love?

37:06.710 --> 37:08.846
Why don't
you explain how you see it?

37:11.215 --> 37:11.949
It feels like

37:15.152 --> 37:16.921
no matter where you are

37:18.155 --> 37:19.622
you can always feel their touch.

37:21.691 --> 37:24.661
You're talking
about physical sensation.

37:24.728 --> 37:25.628
More than that.

37:30.401 --> 37:32.269
Perhaps
you are right.

37:33.938 --> 37:35.739
But are you still not
afraid of the consequences

37:35.806 --> 37:37.640
of losing your husband?

37:48.853 --> 37:49.754
Jamie?

37:53.824 --> 37:54.724
Jamie?

37:56.927 --> 37:57.795
Jamie.

38:05.269 --> 38:06.837
It hasn't worked.

38:08.738 --> 38:10.540
It's over.

38:12.443 --> 38:13.944
I'm sorry.

38:52.917 --> 38:55.753
Who was that girl?

38:55.820 --> 38:56.520
Sofia.

38:57.955 --> 39:00.324
We don't have time for this.

39:04.361 --> 39:05.763
How do I look?

39:29.520 --> 39:31.288
So, how long do we get?

39:32.756 --> 39:35.326
Maybe five minutes?

39:35.392 --> 39:36.293
Up to you.

39:38.028 --> 39:40.264
How long have you been single?

39:40.331 --> 39:42.433
Long enough?

39:42.500 --> 39:44.301
How long is enough?

39:44.368 --> 39:45.302
Maybe never.

39:52.910 --> 39:53.878
Is everything okay?

39:55.379 --> 39:56.847
Yeah, sorry,

39:56.914 --> 39:57.882
I just thought I
saw someone outside.

39:57.948 --> 39:58.983
Mm.

39:59.049 --> 40:00.750
Are you being followed?

40:01.886 --> 40:02.786
What?

40:04.321 --> 40:07.324
I take it you're not
from here, like me.

40:08.559 --> 40:11.362
If I may ask,
where are you from?

40:12.796 --> 40:14.431
The Western States.

40:14.498 --> 40:15.399
Ah.

40:16.267 --> 40:18.402
And why did you immigrate here?

40:18.469 --> 40:19.803
Your union?

40:47.932 --> 40:48.832
Um...

40:55.873 --> 40:57.841
Look, I'm not ready.

40:57.908 --> 40:58.976
I don't wanna rush.

41:00.511 --> 41:03.514
It's okay, it's all
right, don't worry.

41:03.581 --> 41:05.182
Not everybody gets along, right?

41:14.858 --> 41:16.894
How long have they given you?

41:16.961 --> 41:17.795
I'm sorry?

41:17.861 --> 41:18.896
10 days.

41:18.963 --> 41:20.130
They follow you, yes.

41:21.865 --> 41:22.732
Who are you?

41:24.101 --> 41:25.135
I cannot talk here.

41:26.604 --> 41:29.106
Meet me in Central
Car Park, level two,

41:29.173 --> 41:31.008
tomorrow at 8:00 p.m.

41:31.075 --> 41:32.443
Why?

41:32.509 --> 41:33.410
Because

41:35.012 --> 41:36.413
I can change this.

41:43.554 --> 41:45.823
Enjoy your night, madam.

41:45.889 --> 41:47.124
Sorry to not be your type.

41:58.135 --> 42:02.840
You're talking
about physical sensation.

42:02.906 --> 42:04.041
More than that.

42:05.909 --> 42:07.444
Perhaps
you are right.

42:10.047 --> 42:11.482
But are you still not afraid

42:11.548 --> 42:13.484
of the consequences of
losing your husband?

42:16.487 --> 42:17.955
What are the consequences?

42:19.056 --> 42:20.491
I can fend for myself.

42:23.460 --> 42:24.862
So
you have entertained

42:24.928 --> 42:26.830
the possibility of single life.

42:28.632 --> 42:30.167
We all have our fantasies.

42:32.169 --> 42:33.203
It's not a fantasy.

42:38.008 --> 42:38.909
I mean,

42:42.012 --> 42:45.015
it crossed my mind, but
I'm happy with Jamie.

42:45.082 --> 42:47.584
Suppose you
were on your own, though,

42:47.651 --> 42:48.952
for some reason.

42:50.988 --> 42:52.423
I talk about your future,

42:52.489 --> 42:54.825
because it is my utmost
concern at this moment

42:56.060 --> 42:57.561
besides your health
and wellbeing.

43:01.198 --> 43:05.169
So what would happen
if I wasn't married?

43:07.071 --> 43:10.240
As I said, there
is no risk of that happening.

43:12.009 --> 43:15.045
But suppose in an
alternate situation,

43:15.112 --> 43:16.980
that things did not work out,

43:18.682 --> 43:20.117
would you meet someone else?

43:23.020 --> 43:24.621
I don't see how
that's relevant.

43:26.323 --> 43:28.525
- I
- understand your concern,

43:28.592 --> 43:30.327
but this is all
part of my service.

43:34.665 --> 43:39.203
Well, as I'm not in that
situation, I could not say.

43:41.071 --> 43:42.940
I have
another question.

43:45.743 --> 43:50.547
Imagine you were a
fish trapped in a net,

43:52.216 --> 43:54.351
and the only way to free
yourself is to lose your fin.

43:59.156 --> 44:00.124
What would you do?

44:18.609 --> 44:19.343
How did it go?

44:20.644 --> 44:22.045
How do you think?

44:23.347 --> 44:25.549
You met the man
of your dreams.

44:25.616 --> 44:26.583
Don't be stupid.

44:31.588 --> 44:32.956
There must be another way.

44:36.795 --> 44:40.364
Something happened when
I was at the shop, I...

44:41.732 --> 44:42.966
I couldn't touch him.

44:44.168 --> 44:45.202
Who?

44:45.269 --> 44:46.603
The man behind the till.

44:48.773 --> 44:50.207
You mean like us?

44:52.309 --> 44:53.310
Like us.

44:55.245 --> 44:56.947
So it's changed?

44:59.216 --> 45:02.186
Well, I think we
destabilized it.

45:03.620 --> 45:04.621
It doesn't help us.

45:33.450 --> 45:36.587
I'm gonna be late
tomorrow night.

45:36.653 --> 45:37.421
Meeting someone?

45:38.890 --> 45:40.657
They just want
me to work late.

45:41.893 --> 45:43.293
What's the point anymore?

45:46.798 --> 45:47.765
I won't quit.

45:50.234 --> 45:51.201
Neither should you.

45:54.171 --> 45:55.205
What
greater thing in life

45:55.272 --> 45:56.273
is there than freedom?

46:05.282 --> 46:07.117
Well, I wouldn't.

46:07.184 --> 46:09.219
What?

46:09.286 --> 46:10.153
Move on.

46:22.867 --> 46:25.402
Would you
like a drink, Jamie?

46:25.469 --> 46:26.436
Some water?

46:27.839 --> 46:28.806
I'm okay.

46:29.740 --> 46:31.308
Do
you drink often?

46:32.911 --> 46:34.378
I see where this is going.

46:35.813 --> 46:37.347
I'm only
asking a question.

46:38.816 --> 46:40.384
Where would you like this to go?

46:41.886 --> 46:43.387
I'd like your help.

46:43.453 --> 46:44.454
That's why I'm here.

46:46.189 --> 46:47.257
Well,
you don't seem

46:47.324 --> 46:48.191
to have given me a chance.

46:50.327 --> 46:52.062
Can I have some water, please?

46:53.330 --> 46:55.232
- I
- sense indecisiveness.

46:55.299 --> 46:56.500
Is this an issue for you?

46:57.869 --> 46:59.871
Oh, I'm very decisive.

46:59.938 --> 47:03.041
Once I've made my mind up about
something, I stick with it.

47:04.741 --> 47:06.343
You
are not a quitter.

47:09.446 --> 47:11.148
Correct me if I am wrong,

47:12.482 --> 47:14.551
but it takes two people
to maintain heart.

47:17.487 --> 47:18.756
Or you lose trust.

47:22.860 --> 47:24.194
Can I have some water?

47:26.563 --> 47:27.497
Behind you.

47:28.498 --> 47:30.100
In the water dispenser.

47:35.873 --> 47:37.909
When it comes to saving lives,

47:37.976 --> 47:40.711
you just have to do your best.

47:40.778 --> 47:43.380
At least until the
emergency services arrive.

47:43.447 --> 47:45.783
That's why we're
here, for each other.

47:46.985 --> 47:48.820
When you see
someone in distress,

47:48.886 --> 47:51.823
do you choose to ignore
them, or do you run to help?

47:53.323 --> 47:54.859
I want to give
you the confidence

47:54.926 --> 47:56.727
to act quickly and
efficiently to save someone

47:56.794 --> 47:57.895
before it's too late.

47:59.998 --> 48:01.465
Have a great day everyone.

48:01.531 --> 48:02.599
See you soon.

48:21.052 --> 48:23.353
You're getting much better.

48:23.420 --> 48:25.790
You had a
medical question, right?

48:25.857 --> 48:27.157
Yeah, Emily.

48:28.492 --> 48:30.360
How can I help?

48:30.427 --> 48:33.230
Well, I was gonna ask you
the same thing, actually.

48:33.296 --> 48:34.799
What do you mean?

48:34.866 --> 48:35.900
Your union band.

48:37.135 --> 48:38.970
I'm going to the bar
around the corner later on,

48:39.037 --> 48:41.338
so come along if you
wanna finish our chat.

48:43.975 --> 48:46.643
I have a lot going
on at the moment.

48:50.882 --> 48:53.316
It can be hard
losing touch, I know.

48:55.053 --> 48:57.220
But I think I can help.

49:36.060 --> 49:39.463
Look, Sof, I know
I've been a bit hard on you.

49:39.529 --> 49:40.430
A bit.

49:42.566 --> 49:44.434
We live in a
strange world now.

49:45.903 --> 49:47.404
It just messes with your head.

49:47.471 --> 49:49.941
That's no excuse
for being a bitch.

49:50.007 --> 49:50.908
No.

49:52.977 --> 49:53.710
I'm sorry.

50:01.518 --> 50:03.353
Sofia, I need a word.

50:04.922 --> 50:05.655
Out here is fine.

50:06.924 --> 50:07.859
Everything all right?

50:07.925 --> 50:08.993
Not really, no.

50:09.060 --> 50:10.862
You were late the other day,

50:10.928 --> 50:12.362
then you just left
without saying a word.

50:12.429 --> 50:13.597
It's okay.

50:13.663 --> 50:14.564
I quit.

50:17.935 --> 50:20.004
Don't pretend it's
'cause I was late!

50:20.071 --> 50:21.304
It's because of this.

50:22.173 --> 50:23.941
They're gonna take me away,

50:24.008 --> 50:25.877
and you just want
someone to fill my place.

50:25.943 --> 50:27.711
Don't wanna work in your
shitty restaurant anyway.

50:32.150 --> 50:33.050
What?

50:34.584 --> 50:35.485
What?

51:30.707 --> 51:32.009
Is anyone sitting here?

51:33.778 --> 51:35.345
Yeah, you are.

51:39.616 --> 51:42.586
So, how are you single?

51:44.021 --> 51:46.389
I am just fine
on my own, thanks.

51:47.657 --> 51:49.760
And they allow that?

51:49.827 --> 51:50.828
Isn't it up to me?

51:51.796 --> 51:52.797
I'm only 25.

52:00.771 --> 52:03.107
You still act like
you're in a union.

52:03.174 --> 52:04.674
Something like that.

52:06.043 --> 52:07.510
So why are you here then?

52:09.180 --> 52:14.085
I woke up one morning
and couldn't touch my wife.

52:15.052 --> 52:16.453
Couldn't or wouldn't?

52:16.519 --> 52:17.454
I'm serious.

52:19.090 --> 52:21.725
The period for
procreation has expired.

52:21.792 --> 52:23.727
You must find a new
partner to conceive with.

52:23.794 --> 52:25.997
Whoa, why have
you come to me then?

52:26.063 --> 52:28.065
This
union has expired.

52:30.067 --> 52:32.602
You must now find a new
partner to conceive with.

52:33.871 --> 52:36.107
Removal of the band
is not advised.

52:37.174 --> 52:39.110
I need to get rid of this.

52:39.176 --> 52:40.710
Good luck trying.

52:40.778 --> 52:42.113
You said you could help.

52:44.547 --> 52:47.018
I also said that
you need to move on.

52:54.759 --> 52:56.127
For the glass.

53:35.132 --> 53:36.400
You don't
have much time.

53:36.466 --> 53:39.203
They're following you, but
they don't know what floor.

53:39.270 --> 53:41.138
So how can you help?

53:41.205 --> 53:42.672
I know someone that can
get you out of the city

53:42.739 --> 53:44.275
and take this thing off.

53:44.342 --> 53:45.776
What about my husband?

53:45.843 --> 53:47.677
If you trust him,

53:47.744 --> 53:48.678
you will do the right
thing for the both of you.

53:48.745 --> 53:50.081
What if he follows me?

53:50.147 --> 53:52.615
We only need to fix one band.

53:55.319 --> 53:56.821
So I lie to him.

53:56.887 --> 53:58.823
You already have
by coming here, yes?

53:58.889 --> 54:00.257
Sometimes we must.

54:01.292 --> 54:02.093
I can't leave.

54:02.159 --> 54:03.227
There's no way.

54:03.294 --> 54:05.796
Look, do you have a choice?

54:05.863 --> 54:07.765
They'll be here soon,
you must decide.

54:08.899 --> 54:09.934
So what do I do?

54:11.769 --> 54:13.871
We will find you
tomorrow, go to this address.

54:13.938 --> 54:15.172
Tomorrow's too late.

54:15.239 --> 54:16.240
That's when they come for me.

54:16.307 --> 54:18.175
Then be here first.

54:21.644 --> 54:22.712
They're here.

54:23.781 --> 54:25.582
They will search
the top floor first.

54:27.684 --> 54:31.122
They cannot see us talking here.

54:31.188 --> 54:32.589
Trust yourself.

54:50.908 --> 54:52.575
I got caught up.

54:54.278 --> 54:56.746
I passed by the restaurant.

54:56.814 --> 54:58.783
You weren't there.

54:58.849 --> 55:00.217
Did you follow me?

55:20.037 --> 55:20.938
Look,

55:25.742 --> 55:26.709
I met someone.

55:28.379 --> 55:29.780
Who?

55:29.847 --> 55:31.648
The man from that night.

55:31.714 --> 55:32.715
He's not a national.

55:35.019 --> 55:36.954
So you
lied to meet some guy

55:37.021 --> 55:37.922
you went on a date with?

55:37.988 --> 55:38.889
Just listen.

55:40.391 --> 55:42.960
His union band, he
could take it off.

55:44.028 --> 55:44.929
How?

55:45.863 --> 55:47.331
Did he show you?

55:47.398 --> 55:48.332
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

55:48.399 --> 55:49.732
He said he could help.

55:52.036 --> 55:56.739
He said they can get me out
of the city and fix this.

55:57.740 --> 55:58.641
Who's they?

55:59.477 --> 56:01.345
I don't know.

56:01.412 --> 56:02.980
There's a pickup tomorrow.

56:06.350 --> 56:07.885
What, and you're going to go?

56:08.986 --> 56:10.321
What else can we do?

56:32.810 --> 56:34.245
They're here again.

56:44.455 --> 56:46.123
So, will you help me?

56:52.329 --> 56:53.264
Jamie?

57:02.373 --> 57:03.107
Hey.

57:05.910 --> 57:07.444
Have you got a problem?

57:24.128 --> 57:28.832
Imagine you
were a fish trapped in a net

57:30.834 --> 57:33.837
and the only way to free
yourself is to lose your fin.

57:37.141 --> 57:38.075
What would you do?

57:40.878 --> 57:42.112
Find a way to escape.

57:47.184 --> 57:49.787
So you would
rather risk the pain and fear

57:49.853 --> 57:54.792
of losing something, than
stay comfortable in a net?

57:58.395 --> 58:01.398
Where as long as you did not
move, you would be pain-free.

58:03.100 --> 58:05.369
Are you talking
about my marriage?

58:05.436 --> 58:07.871
I am talking
about a fish, Sofia.

58:09.406 --> 58:11.408
Before it is given
an expiry date.

58:37.034 --> 58:38.936
I miss waking up
and kissing you.

58:48.545 --> 58:49.847
Sofia?

1:00:11.528 --> 1:00:12.930
That's it.

1:00:12.996 --> 1:00:14.198
How do you know?

1:00:14.264 --> 1:00:15.466
It must be.

1:00:15.532 --> 1:00:17.468
He said to come here for nine.

1:00:17.534 --> 1:00:18.268
Wait.

1:00:19.103 --> 1:00:21.472
They're here, I have to go.

1:00:21.538 --> 1:00:22.606
What if it's a trap?

1:00:35.586 --> 1:00:37.087
- I'll deal with him.
- Jamie.

1:00:39.556 --> 1:00:40.290
I love you.

1:00:42.059 --> 1:00:42.960
Go.

1:02:24.127 --> 1:02:25.763
Can I go back to something?

1:02:26.764 --> 1:02:28.031
Go ahead.

1:02:32.402 --> 1:02:34.104
You said I wasn't safe.

1:02:35.405 --> 1:02:37.407
I do not
recall such a statement.

1:02:41.411 --> 1:02:43.213
Is my marriage
keeping me safe?

1:02:44.381 --> 1:02:46.216
What are the
consequences of expiry?

1:02:48.820 --> 1:02:51.421
I sense
you are worried, Sofia.

1:02:51.488 --> 1:02:52.790
Of course I'm worried.

1:02:54.191 --> 1:02:57.294
I just want to know what would
happen to me if it expired.

1:03:01.265 --> 1:03:04.067
Are you saying
there is a reason for it to?

1:03:05.502 --> 1:03:08.205
No, no, I'm just
asking what would happen?

1:03:09.874 --> 1:03:12.844
Well, as
you are not originally

1:03:12.911 --> 1:03:16.346
a national citizen, the
rules would not apply.

1:03:18.749 --> 1:03:19.784
What rules?

1:03:22.719 --> 1:03:24.087
Your rights.

1:03:31.194 --> 1:03:32.229
I'd like to go now.

1:03:34.398 --> 1:03:35.432
You
are free to leave

1:03:35.499 --> 1:03:37.200
whenever you want, Sofia.

1:03:49.513 --> 1:03:50.547
Store data.

1:03:53.350 --> 1:03:55.419
This union has expired.

1:04:01.224 --> 1:04:02.326
Did you say something?

1:04:08.298 --> 1:04:10.500
We were
talking about keeping heart.

1:04:11.903 --> 1:04:13.170
The union band.

1:04:14.404 --> 1:04:15.372
On your wrist.

1:04:17.842 --> 1:04:19.309
You remember why you got it?

1:04:25.449 --> 1:04:27.451
A symbol of permanence.

1:04:27.517 --> 1:04:29.386
Of love.

1:04:29.453 --> 1:04:32.723
Everything will be normal
so long as you are in love.

1:04:32.790 --> 1:04:34.391
And what if it changes?

1:04:36.259 --> 1:04:38.195
You don't have
to worry about that, Jamie.

1:04:39.429 --> 1:04:41.465
So long as I trust Sofia,

1:04:41.531 --> 1:04:43.233
there's nothing to worry about.

1:04:44.534 --> 1:04:45.803
Exactly.

1:04:47.304 --> 1:04:49.406
But that's what brought
you here, isn't it?

1:04:50.607 --> 1:04:51.843
Because you're worried.

1:04:57.280 --> 1:04:59.516
Might I remind you
of confidentiality.

1:05:02.386 --> 1:05:04.922
What if the union stops
working for some reason?

1:05:07.557 --> 1:05:10.260
If a couple
are really at the end,

1:05:10.327 --> 1:05:12.396
they have nothing left
to give each other,

1:05:13.363 --> 1:05:14.932
then a decision is made.

1:05:19.837 --> 1:05:21.571
So then what happens?

1:06:14.424 --> 1:06:15.993
Sofia's husband, right?

1:06:16.060 --> 1:06:17.394
Well, ex husband now.

1:06:18.495 --> 1:06:19.362
They took her.

1:06:21.032 --> 1:06:21.899
Right.

1:06:22.934 --> 1:06:23.968
Okay.

1:06:24.035 --> 1:06:25.469
I'll talk to you, come on.

1:06:32.043 --> 1:06:32.944
Where is she?

1:06:34.244 --> 1:06:36.513
She was getting too close
to my husband, all right.

1:06:36.580 --> 1:06:37.614
If she's run off somewhere,

1:06:37.681 --> 1:06:39.316
then it's not my problem, is it?

1:06:39.382 --> 1:06:41.018
10 days.

1:06:41.085 --> 1:06:43.653
You told her she had 10
days before they take her.

1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:44.989
Don't know what
you're talking about.

1:06:45.056 --> 1:06:46.590
Well, where did they take her?

1:06:47.657 --> 1:06:49.326
I don't know where Sofia is.

1:06:51.929 --> 1:06:54.866
All I know is what happened
to my last husband.

1:06:54.932 --> 1:06:56.333
They gave him 10 days.

1:07:00.071 --> 1:07:02.639
They watched him, and
then they followed him.

1:07:03.707 --> 1:07:05.509
So why didn't they follow you?

1:07:05.575 --> 1:07:06.743
'Cause I was born here.

1:07:08.012 --> 1:07:09.312
I'm a national citizen.

1:07:11.082 --> 1:07:12.884
Well, what did they do to him?

1:07:12.950 --> 1:07:15.887
Did they trick him, tell
him they could help?

1:07:15.953 --> 1:07:18.622
No, they
came to our house.

1:07:18.688 --> 1:07:20.057
It was all really official.

1:07:23.493 --> 1:07:24.996
You mean he didn't disappear?

1:07:25.062 --> 1:07:25.963
No white van?

1:07:27.697 --> 1:07:28.698
It was done formal.

1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:33.470
As formal as getting
rid of someone can be.

1:07:56.693 --> 1:07:57.594
Come on.

1:07:59.563 --> 1:08:03.134
This
union has expired.

1:08:03.201 --> 1:08:05.735
You must now find a new
partner to conceive with.

1:08:07.171 --> 1:08:09.739
Removal of the band
is not advised.

1:08:17.614 --> 1:08:18.515
Emily.

1:08:19.583 --> 1:08:21.751
I'm sorry, this is my wife.

1:08:24.188 --> 1:08:25.622
Sorry.

1:08:31.661 --> 1:08:33.030
I need your help.

1:08:50.614 --> 1:08:52.449
You've not made the bed.

1:08:52.515 --> 1:08:54.151
Not ideal for
bringing a lady back.

1:08:56.254 --> 1:08:57.454
They've taken her.

1:08:59.656 --> 1:09:00.523
Who?

1:09:01.292 --> 1:09:02.626
My wife.

1:09:03.761 --> 1:09:04.694
No, I get that Jamie.

1:09:04.762 --> 1:09:05.796
I mean who's taken her?

1:09:09.100 --> 1:09:10.467
When the bands
stopped working,

1:09:10.533 --> 1:09:11.869
we didn't know what to do.

1:09:13.703 --> 1:09:15.472
Some men started following her.

1:09:17.241 --> 1:09:20.477
And then she met this man
who said he could help.

1:09:20.543 --> 1:09:22.146
I didn't think it
was a good idea.

1:09:23.814 --> 1:09:26.150
The other morning she
left to go and meet him.

1:09:28.219 --> 1:09:29.887
There was a van.

1:09:31.322 --> 1:09:33.157
I tried to stop them,
but they took her.

1:09:36.294 --> 1:09:37.661
What was this van like?

1:09:39.096 --> 1:09:39.830
White.

1:09:41.866 --> 1:09:43.100
Just white?

1:09:43.167 --> 1:09:43.901
Is that it?

1:09:45.102 --> 1:09:46.436
I've heard nothing since.

1:09:47.204 --> 1:09:47.905
Okay.

1:09:49.572 --> 1:09:51.641
Okay, right, look,
you want my advice?

1:09:51.708 --> 1:09:53.510
I'm gonna need
something from you.

1:09:54.779 --> 1:09:56.180
I'm not looking for that.

1:09:57.714 --> 1:09:59.582
I don't wanna have
sex with you, Jamie.

1:10:00.851 --> 1:10:02.219
I wanna be able to
do what you can do.

1:10:04.288 --> 1:10:05.588
I wanna destabilize it.

1:10:19.736 --> 1:10:21.538
Why do you want
to do this anyway?

1:10:21.604 --> 1:10:23.174
You won't be able
to touch anyone.

1:10:24.775 --> 1:10:25.675
Yeah, exactly.

1:10:27.644 --> 1:10:28.545
That?

1:10:29.380 --> 1:10:30.948
This is how I did it.

1:10:33.650 --> 1:10:35.585
You've got to be kidding me.

1:10:37.254 --> 1:10:38.621
Do you want
to do this or not?

1:10:46.730 --> 1:10:48.966
It's not exactly
first aid 101, is it?

1:10:53.904 --> 1:10:55.806
You wanted to
know how I did it.

1:10:55.873 --> 1:10:57.208
This is the only way I know.

1:10:59.709 --> 1:11:00.778
All right, thanks, doctor.

1:11:00.845 --> 1:11:03.646
Look, just get on with it, okay?

1:11:11.654 --> 1:11:13.690
Analyzing heart rhythm.

1:11:15.993 --> 1:11:17.795
Do not touch the patient.

1:11:21.766 --> 1:11:22.900
Shock advised.

1:11:25.836 --> 1:11:26.736
Charging.

1:11:28.806 --> 1:11:30.540
Stay clear of the patient.

1:11:34.378 --> 1:11:38.249
Deliver shock now, press
the orange button now.

1:12:07.478 --> 1:12:08.779
Please stop.

1:12:11.982 --> 1:12:13.984
Has it worked?

1:12:28.731 --> 1:12:31.634
Payback for that
wine.

1:12:33.838 --> 1:12:34.737
What next?

1:12:37.775 --> 1:12:38.776
We leave the city.

1:12:40.010 --> 1:12:41.278
I'm not waiting anymore.

1:12:42.980 --> 1:12:44.815
So why have you
left it till now?

1:12:49.887 --> 1:12:52.857
I was waiting
for the right time.

1:12:57.828 --> 1:13:00.231
There are guards on
the edge of town.

1:13:00.297 --> 1:13:02.933
Get past them and we've got
a chance of reaching them.

1:13:36.567 --> 1:13:37.935
How do we get past them?

1:13:39.937 --> 1:13:41.438
We have to get up there first.

1:13:45.809 --> 1:13:46.911
Shit.

1:13:48.879 --> 1:13:50.314
They followed us.

1:13:50.381 --> 1:13:52.749
They followed you,
it's too late now.

1:14:00.491 --> 1:14:01.425
Wait here.

1:14:01.492 --> 1:14:02.226
Where are you going?

1:14:03.494 --> 1:14:05.496
They can't touch us, remember?

1:14:05.563 --> 1:14:06.696
They can.

1:14:29.587 --> 1:14:31.889
Do
not touch the patient.

1:14:31.956 --> 1:14:32.856
Charging.

1:14:34.625 --> 1:14:36.927
Stay clear of the patient.

1:15:36.220 --> 1:15:37.421
Come on, we've
not got much time.

1:15:37.488 --> 1:15:38.555
They would have tracked us.

1:15:40.057 --> 1:15:41.191
I thought no one
lived out here.

1:16:23.167 --> 1:16:26.170
What have
you done to her?

1:16:29.640 --> 1:16:31.175
I will tell you,

1:16:31.241 --> 1:16:33.544
but right now you
both need my help.

1:16:33.610 --> 1:16:35.579
We cannot stay here
long, come, come.

1:16:35.646 --> 1:16:37.514
You go first for
helping my friend.

1:16:40.651 --> 1:16:42.653
Why couldn't you
help her yourself?

1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:44.188
Like Sofia?

1:16:44.254 --> 1:16:45.189
Where is she?

1:16:46.256 --> 1:16:47.558
Emily had to stay with you

1:16:47.624 --> 1:16:49.059
to make sure you were ready.

1:16:50.661 --> 1:16:51.562
Ready for what?

1:16:54.198 --> 1:16:55.866
Your arm, please?

1:17:00.137 --> 1:17:01.038
Trust yourself.

1:17:23.293 --> 1:17:24.161
Alors.

1:17:25.295 --> 1:17:26.330
You have disappeared.

1:17:34.571 --> 1:17:36.039
How does it work?

1:17:38.142 --> 1:17:40.110
These bands,

1:17:40.177 --> 1:17:42.146
they were made to
attract each other.

1:17:43.380 --> 1:17:46.083
But when they repel,
there's no way

1:17:46.150 --> 1:17:48.285
that two objects
can touch until...

1:17:48.352 --> 1:17:49.686
Until you take one off.

1:18:00.330 --> 1:18:01.198
Thank you.

1:18:10.407 --> 1:18:11.341
I knew you'd come.

1:18:14.111 --> 1:18:15.312
Your union band.

1:18:37.367 --> 1:18:39.636
They have taken this too far.

1:18:39.703 --> 1:18:43.006
Leave them on, take them off.

1:18:44.341 --> 1:18:45.242
Up to you.

1:18:53.116 --> 1:18:55.285
I believe in
freedom, Mr. Cooper.

1:18:57.154 --> 1:19:01.458
If people want to commit, let
them commit, but by choice.

1:19:09.132 --> 1:19:11.235
Look, we wanna make
sure that people want

1:19:11.301 --> 1:19:14.404
to challenge this
system, but in secret.

1:19:15.840 --> 1:19:17.241
People like you.

1:19:18.877 --> 1:19:21.011
This country
was built on differences.

1:19:21.813 --> 1:19:23.347
We can change things.

1:19:26.483 --> 1:19:28.685
What if they find out
we can't have children?

1:19:28.752 --> 1:19:30.087
Then don't.

1:19:30.153 --> 1:19:31.622
Live freely.

1:19:31.688 --> 1:19:32.723
And go back?

1:19:34.926 --> 1:19:38.195
And face the
things we've run from.

1:20:35.853 --> 1:20:38.288
Do you know what
it's like to love someone?

1:20:45.830 --> 1:20:46.764
It's like

1:20:54.504 --> 1:20:55.873
no matter where they are,

1:21:10.253 --> 1:21:12.189
whatever obstacles
are put in your way

1:21:29.807 --> 1:21:31.809
you can still feel their touch.
