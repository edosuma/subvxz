00:05.044 --> 00:08.029
<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:08.031 --> 00:10.552
<i>Pavel hides a weapon
intended for the enemy.</i>

00:12.322 --> 00:15.194
Now I'm faster! And stronger!

00:16.263 --> 00:18.166
I'm indestructible!

00:18.201 --> 00:21.340
<i>While Paige unwittingly
gets cozy with the enemy.</i>

00:21.374 --> 00:25.615
I have to admit...
you are one impressive mechanic.

00:25.649 --> 00:28.621
Why don't you look me up
when you get back to Argon?

00:28.655 --> 00:31.694
Maybe we can... hang out.

00:32.729 --> 00:34.399
<i>I'd like that.</i>

00:36.403 --> 00:37.472
<i>What a waste.</i>

00:38.642 --> 00:40.544
<i>They usually don't last this long.</i>

00:40.578 --> 00:44.486
<i>- Who are you?
- You said it yourself:</i>

00:44.521 --> 00:45.755
<i>I'm Tron.</i>

00:46.791 --> 00:47.791
<i>Who are you?</i>

00:50.698 --> 00:52.636
<i>Who are you?</i>

00:54.806 --> 00:55.808
<i>Who...</i>

00:57.379 --> 00:58.481
<i>Who...</i>

00:59.516 --> 01:02.656
This isn't what it looks like.
I was just...

01:02.690 --> 01:04.325
gauging my opponent.

01:04.358 --> 01:06.462
And... what did you learn?

01:07.499 --> 01:09.502
That she wants to kill me.

01:09.536 --> 01:13.343
Then you probably shouldn't have
agreed to go on that "date" with her.

01:13.377 --> 01:14.745
It's not a date.

01:14.780 --> 01:19.455
Page is a Commander in the
enemy's army. I'm gathering intel.

01:20.491 --> 01:21.652
For the good of the uprising.

01:24.333 --> 01:25.667
Your hair looks fine.

01:25.702 --> 01:28.373
It's your stance that's
all over the place.

01:31.714 --> 01:34.785
I'm not trying to recruit Paige
because I like her.

01:34.820 --> 01:36.588
Since when are you recruiting her?

01:36.623 --> 01:38.627
I thought you were gathering intel.

01:40.465 --> 01:43.569
She's different.
And she can be turned.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.807
I think. I have to try.

01:47.412 --> 01:49.782
Winning her over may
be a lost cause, Beck.

01:49.816 --> 01:52.521
But I won't try to talk you out of it.

01:57.798 --> 02:02.340
Bet this is your first time taking
a nose dive off a helicopter.

02:03.376 --> 02:04.377
Hmm.

02:04.412 --> 02:06.648
Come on! Race you to the bottom!

02:10.691 --> 02:13.028
For the good of the uprising.

02:15.673 --> 02:25.173
<b>S01E17 - Rendezvous</b>

02:56.714 --> 03:00.854
<i>Allow me to introduce
you to the best seat in town.</i>

03:01.891 --> 03:03.792
Not bad, huh?

03:06.499 --> 03:08.471
It's incredible.

03:09.505 --> 03:10.640
When you said, "hang out,"

03:10.674 --> 03:13.847
I thought you meant
"go to Argon square," or the club.

03:13.881 --> 03:16.719
Or, you know,
somewhere closer to the ground.

03:16.754 --> 03:19.592
- You don't like it?
- Oh...

03:19.626 --> 03:21.930
this is way more fun. I love it.

03:22.966 --> 03:25.504
I had a feeling you would.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.645
This is where I come to be alone...

03:29.680 --> 03:31.682
when I need to think.

03:31.716 --> 03:35.690
I know what you mean.
It's good to get away from it all.

03:35.724 --> 03:38.662
Helps to see things
from a fresh perspective.

03:39.666 --> 03:41.702
Maybe the opposite perspective.

03:50.587 --> 03:53.893
<i>All prisoners
prepare for pod inspection.</i>

04:02.845 --> 04:04.714
They'll do.

04:13.967 --> 04:16.672
Oh, poor, vulnerable me!

04:16.706 --> 04:19.744
I just unlocked the door.
And your discs.

04:19.779 --> 04:21.581
And now I'm standing here defenseless.

04:21.616 --> 04:24.921
Please... don't try to escape!

04:41.988 --> 04:45.695
Test run complete.
I'd say this weapon is as good as new.

04:45.730 --> 04:48.935
Didn't you tell Tesler
that thing was destroyed?

04:48.969 --> 04:51.841
I wouldn't recommend butting
in here where you don't belong.

04:52.911 --> 04:53.912
Ah!

04:53.913 --> 04:57.819
Lucky for you,
I'm seeing things from a...

04:57.854 --> 04:59.690
fresh perspective.

04:59.724 --> 05:00.993
So I'll give you the chance

05:01.027 --> 05:02.963
to return that weapon
to Tesler on your own.

05:02.997 --> 05:06.938
- And if I don't?
- Then I'll derez you, obviously.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.643
But I know it won't come to that.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.682
You have to the end of the
cycle to do the right thing,

05:12.717 --> 05:14.620
or I'll do it for you.

05:21.902 --> 05:24.606
See? Was that so hard?

05:33.959 --> 05:36.931
<i>No. I'm done erasing discs.</i>

05:36.965 --> 05:39.035
You have to!
I need my history erased!

05:39.069 --> 05:42.642
Not only is it illegal,
it's dangerous work.

05:42.677 --> 05:45.982
Let me have my assistant,
Lomox, enlighten you.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.971
Code worms...

05:57.005 --> 05:59.943
found only in the darkest
recesses of the Grid,

05:59.978 --> 06:02.983
and very effective at rewriting discs.

06:03.017 --> 06:07.925
If you lose control of even one,
it deletes more than your past.

06:10.832 --> 06:14.739
I'm begging you! Erase my disc!
I stole this light jet.

06:14.773 --> 06:17.611
When the guards see my
memories, they'll kill me!

06:17.646 --> 06:18.747
No, stop!

06:18.781 --> 06:19.782
What are you doing?!

06:21.854 --> 06:25.594
A light jet?
Now you're speaking my language.

06:27.799 --> 06:30.036
You... out!

06:33.878 --> 06:37.818
Pavel, you're back... so soon.

06:38.854 --> 06:41.024
Why are you still here? Go, go!

06:46.002 --> 06:49.809
I like your new friend, Gorn.
Talkative.

06:49.843 --> 06:53.750
Now let's discuss a little
passion project of mine.

06:53.784 --> 06:56.689
<i>We're going to give
someone near and dear to me</i>

06:56.724 --> 06:58.960
<i>an attitude adjustment.</i>

07:01.132 --> 07:03.903
<i>Three points.</i>

07:07.678 --> 07:08.779
Showoff.

07:08.813 --> 07:10.650
You think you got better?

07:10.684 --> 07:11.985
Yeah, well, watch this.

07:14.959 --> 07:15.993
<i>Foul shot.</i>

07:16.028 --> 07:17.864
<i>- Hey!
- ...points deduction.</i>

07:17.898 --> 07:20.736
Sorry. He's a first-timer.

07:20.771 --> 07:22.974
What can I say?
I'm a lost cause.

07:25.647 --> 07:27.083
That wasn't supposed to happen.

07:28.687 --> 07:31.058
You actually know how to enjoy yourself.

07:31.092 --> 07:33.061
Is it that surprising?

07:33.095 --> 07:36.802
Kinda. I wasn't sure it
was in your programming.

07:36.836 --> 07:38.639
<i>Three points.</i>

07:38.673 --> 07:41.778
Sometimes, our true
programming can be a mystery.

07:43.683 --> 07:45.051
Finding mine has been a journey.

07:47.791 --> 07:49.794
<i>Ten points.</i>

07:49.829 --> 07:53.869
Maybe your journey's not over,
and you're not really meant to...

07:53.903 --> 07:55.072
fight for the occupation.

07:55.107 --> 07:58.679
I don't. I fight for Clu.

07:59.715 --> 08:00.916
Sounds perfect.

08:03.823 --> 08:05.893
Well...

08:05.927 --> 08:08.665
There is this coworker I've
been having issues with.

08:08.700 --> 08:09.701
<i>Foul shot...</i>

08:09.702 --> 08:14.710
But I took your advice, looked at
things from a fresh perspective

08:14.744 --> 08:17.015
and made a risky move.

08:17.049 --> 08:19.854
Sometimes I wonder
why we don't take risks more often.

08:19.889 --> 08:21.090
You don't know what it's like

08:21.124 --> 08:23.662
to have to wear a mask all the time.

08:23.696 --> 08:25.932
<i>Scratch. Loss of turn.</i>

08:29.875 --> 08:31.877
You're not wearing a mask now.

08:36.989 --> 08:39.025
<i>She's over there!</i>

08:39.058 --> 08:40.727
Arrest her!

08:42.933 --> 08:44.736
- Come with us.
- Aah!

08:44.771 --> 08:47.107
Pavel! What are you doing?

08:47.143 --> 08:50.147
My duty! How could you, Paige?

08:50.181 --> 08:54.121
Conspiring to overthrow Tesler?
You leave me no choice.

08:54.157 --> 08:56.192
I'm taking you in.

09:01.685 --> 09:05.368
This is absurd!
I haven't done anything.

09:05.403 --> 09:07.571
Yet.
Fortunately, a loyal citizen

09:07.606 --> 09:09.576
reported you before you
could enact your plan.

09:09.611 --> 09:11.579
What are you talking about?

09:11.614 --> 09:13.283
Take her away!

09:14.520 --> 09:16.423
Hey! Get your hands off her.

09:17.459 --> 09:20.597
I wouldn't do that. You don't
know who you're messing with.

09:20.632 --> 09:24.338
Oh? And who are we
messing with, program?

09:24.373 --> 09:27.545
He's got nothing to do with this,
Pavel. Leave him out of this.

09:27.579 --> 09:32.622
No, I think we'll arrest him, too.
He's obviously part of your cabal.

09:32.657 --> 09:35.627
Rubbing elbows
with the great unwashed?

09:35.662 --> 09:37.765
Someone get me a towel.

09:41.607 --> 09:45.814
<i>- I assume he was the coworker?
- Was it that obvious?</i>

09:45.849 --> 09:47.718
<i>Maybe we can break out of here.</i>

09:47.753 --> 09:51.693
- If we could get our discs unlocked.
- That's not gonna help things.

09:51.727 --> 09:54.534
Only guilty programs go on the run.

09:54.566 --> 09:57.805
<i>Besides, it's not necessary.
Once Tesler sees my disc,</i>

09:57.840 --> 10:00.476
<i>He'll know I'm innocent,
and we'll both be free.</i>

10:00.511 --> 10:02.481
This'll all be over soon.

10:06.624 --> 10:08.426
Taking me to Tesler?

10:12.769 --> 10:14.806
Hey! What're you doing?

10:15.842 --> 10:20.550
When Tesler finds out about this,
he'll see that you're derezzed.

10:28.567 --> 10:30.436
Who are you?

10:52.748 --> 10:54.952
<i>Tesler had his chance to lead,</i>

10:54.987 --> 10:56.856
<i>but he's useless,</i>

10:56.891 --> 10:58.659
<i>gullible, obsolete.</i>

10:58.693 --> 11:00.898
<i>That's a fake memory, isn't it?
So I'm taking over.</i>

11:01.933 --> 11:03.737
Who put you up to this?!

11:03.771 --> 11:06.608
<i>Who put you up to this?!</i>

11:08.613 --> 11:09.614
Paige!

11:10.885 --> 11:12.487
What'd they do to you?

11:14.759 --> 11:17.529
They made me a guilty program.

11:19.802 --> 11:23.642
I guess that means
I should act like a guilty program.

11:33.530 --> 11:35.967
Hey. Get up, program.

11:36.001 --> 11:37.569
Where's the Commander?

11:39.909 --> 11:41.844
Don't even think about it.

11:53.603 --> 11:54.603
Container breach.

11:54.637 --> 11:56.708
<i>Security alert.</i>

11:56.743 --> 11:59.581
- We got 'em.
- Stay behind me!

11:59.615 --> 12:01.550
<i>Security alert.</i>

12:23.796 --> 12:24.863
Catch!

12:51.684 --> 12:54.789
<i>We should head for the
outland! It's our only chance.</i>

12:54.823 --> 12:57.796
- What do you mean, "we"?
- We're in this together.

12:57.830 --> 13:00.869
No. I'm a lost cause, Beck.

13:00.903 --> 13:03.941
- No, you're not!
- And you have to let me go.

13:03.976 --> 13:05.611
Paige!

13:08.851 --> 13:10.622
Paige!

13:34.971 --> 13:37.776
You're the one who forges discs!

13:40.648 --> 13:42.618
What do you want from me?

13:42.652 --> 13:43.820
I think you know that answer.

13:43.854 --> 13:46.826
I already told you. Go away!

13:46.860 --> 13:50.032
- I don't erase discs!
- What? What are you talking...

13:50.067 --> 13:52.738
I was afraid we'd find you here.

14:02.025 --> 14:03.760
General.

14:07.836 --> 14:10.574
<i>Tesler had his chance to lead,</i>

14:10.608 --> 14:11.675
<i>but he's useless,</i>

14:11.709 --> 14:14.915
<i>gullible, obsolete.</i>

14:14.950 --> 14:16.786
<i>So I'm taking over.</i>

14:16.820 --> 14:18.689
She's the one who came to me!

14:18.723 --> 14:20.727
That's what she wanted erased!

14:20.762 --> 14:24.634
General, she's lying!
I've never been here before!

14:24.669 --> 14:29.978
I saved your life!
And this is how you repay me?

14:30.013 --> 14:31.949
No, no, no, no! It's not true!

14:31.984 --> 14:35.056
- I'm innocent!
- Get her out of my sight.

15:22.228 --> 15:25.233
<i>We're running out
of gladiators to fight her!</i>

15:25.267 --> 15:29.341
Is there not one program
in Argon worthy of Paige?

15:29.375 --> 15:32.213
Mmm. There is one, sir.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.464
<i>Citizens of Argon!</i>

15:40.498 --> 15:43.369
<i>Distinguished guests
from around the Grid!</i>

15:43.403 --> 15:47.410
<i>We now present
the one and only warrior</i>

15:47.445 --> 15:52.187
<i>worthy of locking discs with the
traitorous Ex-commander Paige.</i>

15:53.222 --> 15:54.424
Me!

15:54.459 --> 15:58.499
- Oh, really?
- I might've brought a little help.

16:37.578 --> 16:40.483
Pavel, you know me!
I'm innocent.

16:40.517 --> 16:43.221
It's your disloyalty
that brought us here.

16:46.195 --> 16:48.231
You don't really wanna do this, Pavel.

16:48.265 --> 16:50.503
That weapon is messing with your head.

16:50.537 --> 16:51.604
Goodbye, Paige.

17:00.691 --> 17:04.230
You! You did this! Why?!

17:04.263 --> 17:06.166
Looked to me like you were about to die.

17:06.201 --> 17:08.338
Land this jet now!

17:12.347 --> 17:14.517
All you did was make me look guilty.

17:56.668 --> 17:59.339
Listen! I know you're innocent.

18:03.682 --> 18:06.586
You don't deserve what they did to you.

18:11.297 --> 18:14.469
Your own team framed you,
tried to kill you.

18:14.503 --> 18:17.576
But you'd never do that,
because you're not like them.

18:18.578 --> 18:22.351
Join me. We can work together.

18:22.386 --> 18:26.493
We're both trying to save the Grid.
Just in different ways.

18:26.527 --> 18:30.166
No! You're destroying the Grid!

18:30.200 --> 18:34.308
You rain down chaos,
and I won't rest until you're stopped.

18:34.342 --> 18:39.419
- I could never join you.
- I'm fighting for you, too.

18:39.453 --> 18:42.191
Then you've already lost!

18:59.593 --> 19:00.627
<i>Halt, program!</i>

19:10.548 --> 19:14.488
Did you really think I wouldn't have
all of your escape routes covered?

19:14.522 --> 19:17.260
I'm just trying to
find out who framed me.

19:18.363 --> 19:21.235
I already know who framed you, Paige.

19:22.304 --> 19:25.209
Paige! You're okay!

19:25.244 --> 19:26.278
Thank goodness!

19:26.312 --> 19:30.436
It was the Renegade, Paige.
You can thank Pavel

19:30.437 --> 19:33.392
for going back to Gorn
and uncovering the real truth.

19:34.663 --> 19:39.371
<i>Make sure she looks guilty.
I'll enjoy watching Paige suffer.</i>

19:39.405 --> 19:41.408
Well...

19:41.443 --> 19:43.479
What do you have to say for yourself?

19:47.320 --> 19:51.461
You saved me?
But you tried to kill me earlier.

19:51.495 --> 19:53.632
- With...
- With this?

19:54.669 --> 19:59.678
See, Paige? I was always going to
turn it in, once I knew it worked.

20:02.585 --> 20:05.388
Excellent work, Pavel.

20:05.423 --> 20:08.528
To reward you, I'm granting you
command of your own district.

20:08.562 --> 20:12.336
My... own... district?

20:12.370 --> 20:16.411
Purgos. That foul stink
hole where Gorn operated.

20:16.446 --> 20:18.481
You're the best program
to clean it up for me.

20:21.555 --> 20:25.695
Congratulations.
Oh, and thanks for having my back.

20:25.730 --> 20:30.606
I'll be sure to return the favor.
Somehow, some way.

20:41.595 --> 20:44.500
You made it.
I was afraid you were a no-show.

20:44.534 --> 20:47.706
I got my job back. Don't worry.

20:47.740 --> 20:49.743
I made sure they won't come after you.

20:49.778 --> 20:52.382
That's not why I'm worried.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.418
Look...

20:54.453 --> 20:56.591
because I listened to your advice,

20:56.625 --> 20:59.630
I got soft. I lost focus.

21:01.668 --> 21:05.775
And that's why I can't
be with you. I'm sorry.

21:13.860 --> 21:17.532
Good news. Your friend Lomox
was very cooperative.

21:17.567 --> 21:21.674
Tesler bought your latest forgery.
We're in the clear.

21:21.708 --> 21:26.550
Oh, and I trust you'll keep mum
about my involvement, of course.

21:28.788 --> 21:33.631
That's the spirit, Gorn.
Just smile and nod your head.
