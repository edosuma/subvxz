WEBVTT

00:07.708 --> 00:08.942
‐ Please, Wynonna.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.611
Teach me to be like you.
‐ Ooh.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.280
‐ Why would the Garden offer me
a book we can't read?

00:13.313 --> 00:15.682
(screaming)
‐ Must be awful

00:15.716 --> 00:17.150
losing your whole family.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.253
‐ I want her.
‐ I'm doing you a favour.

00:19.286 --> 00:20.921
‐ You think you're gonna get
away with‐‐

00:20.954 --> 00:21.688
(gunshot)

00:21.722 --> 00:25.325
‐ Selfish little angel!

00:25.359 --> 00:27.261
‐ What's going on?
‐ How do I find her?

00:27.995 --> 00:29.930
(Waverly growling)

00:32.099 --> 00:34.167
(Waverly): Your journey
is over, Wynonna Earp.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.236
And mine has just begun.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.206
(grunting)

00:39.239 --> 00:41.041
(guard): Come on!
(Doc): You killed her!

00:41.074 --> 00:42.643
(guard): Come on! Back! Back!

00:42.676 --> 00:44.077
(growling)
(Jeremy): Hey!

00:44.111 --> 00:45.512
‐ General Graham?

00:45.546 --> 00:46.580
‐ They're all gonna
be food anyway.

00:46.613 --> 00:48.582
‐ Doc! Doc! Stay back!

00:48.615 --> 00:51.118
‐ Keep me away from her!
‐ Hey, don't worry.

00:51.151 --> 00:52.252
You only have to survive
'til morning,

00:52.286 --> 00:53.053
then it's off to the ark.

00:53.086 --> 00:55.022
To be food for our demons,
but hey,

00:55.055 --> 00:56.390
another day is another day.

00:56.423 --> 00:57.491
‐ Mercedes, are you okay?

00:57.524 --> 01:00.360
‐ Not to be a Nedley,
but this hurts like a bitch.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.263
And I paid a ton of customs
to get this outfit here

01:03.297 --> 01:04.998
and now,
it's covered in blood.

01:05.032 --> 01:06.433
It's soaked in blood!

01:06.466 --> 01:09.036
(Jeremy): Doc!
I know that you're in there!

01:09.069 --> 01:10.070
You gotta fight it!

01:10.103 --> 01:12.072
You are not going to feed!

01:12.105 --> 01:13.340
(growling)

01:13.373 --> 01:14.741
I could use some help
from a half angel

01:14.775 --> 01:17.611
and a chick
with a big ass gun right now!

01:18.145 --> 01:19.613
‐ You're beautiful.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.549
And terrible.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.585
(dramatic music)

01:26.119 --> 01:27.154
The fog?

01:27.187 --> 01:29.089
‐ The fog is no longer
necessary.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.959
I am the fail‐safe.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.461
‐ What did Jolene do to you?

01:34.494 --> 01:35.562
‐ Jolene.

01:36.563 --> 01:40.000
Ah yes, the body's other half.

01:40.534 --> 01:43.437
Well, I suppose she helped
Waverly...

01:44.605 --> 01:46.273
evolve.

01:46.306 --> 01:48.408
‐ Waverly Earp, you wipe that
ethereal look off your face

01:48.442 --> 01:51.144
this minute.
This is not an Enya video.

01:51.178 --> 01:52.479
I want my sister back.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.048
‐ I have but one destination.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.284
‐ You do not walk away from me!

01:57.317 --> 01:58.418
I've been through hell
to get you back,

01:58.452 --> 02:00.587
so if you think for a second
you're just gonna bail.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.357
‐ The affairs of man
are no longer my concern.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.125
‐ I'm no man.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.229
I'm the woman who will not
watch you become this...

02:09.262 --> 02:10.464
thing.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.699
‐ As you wish.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.601
(gasping)

02:14.635 --> 02:16.403
(dramatic music)

02:16.436 --> 02:18.238
(moaning)

02:20.774 --> 02:22.309
‐ What did you do?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.011
Why?

02:24.811 --> 02:26.546
‐ Because it's her turn,
Wynonna.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.616
(Wynonna): I can't see.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.351
I can't see.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.488
Waverly?

02:35.155 --> 02:37.324
Don't leave me alone
in the dark!

02:39.159 --> 02:41.662
(theme music)

02:43.563 --> 02:46.700
♪ 'Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

02:46.733 --> 02:49.336
♪ I know that ain't
no way to live ♪

02:49.369 --> 02:54.241
♪ I told that devil
to take you back ♪

02:54.274 --> 02:59.212
♪ I told that devil
to take you back ♪

03:00.714 --> 03:02.049
(sighing)

03:03.016 --> 03:04.351
(chuckling softly)

03:04.384 --> 03:07.387
‐ So, how's Little Heroes
Training Camp going?

03:07.421 --> 03:09.389
You a big murder machine
like Wynonna yet?

03:09.423 --> 03:10.524
‐ Be quiet.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.227
‐ God, the sound of Doc
and Jeremy,

03:14.261 --> 03:17.798
of all of those helpless humans
locked in that cage,

03:17.831 --> 03:20.267
screaming out to Wynonna
as she just

03:20.300 --> 03:22.536
marched off with
the last living Clanton.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.438
I don't think
I'll ever sleep again.

03:24.471 --> 03:27.507
‐ Whatever choices
Wynonna's made, she has a plan.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.242
And I trust her.

03:29.276 --> 03:30.811
‐ Aw...

03:30.844 --> 03:32.546
The only thing
you should trust

03:32.579 --> 03:34.481
is that sick little feeling
in your gut.

03:34.514 --> 03:38.652
Because that Reaper in the fog
with Wynonna...

03:39.586 --> 03:40.620
It is Billy.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.857
‐ No. Wynonna wouldn't
do that to me.

03:43.890 --> 03:48.495
‐ Billy may have pulled out
his own tooth to save you,

03:48.528 --> 03:49.930
but Wynonna?

03:49.963 --> 03:52.199
She's leading him to his death.

03:56.069 --> 04:01.174
God. I am not
your enemy, Rachel.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.576
Really.

04:02.609 --> 04:06.446
I just... I wanna get the hell
out of this place.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.748
For good.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.382
And Wynonna?

04:10.617 --> 04:12.452
She is a shit.

04:12.486 --> 04:15.122
Just like every Earp
before her.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.324
‐ She's good people.

04:17.357 --> 04:18.625
And she's my family.

04:18.658 --> 04:21.228
‐ Okay... sweetie.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.498
But are you hers?

04:26.266 --> 04:27.634
(sizzling)

04:27.667 --> 04:29.269
‐ Jolene's hair is burning.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.403
What does that mean?

04:30.437 --> 04:32.272
‐ That the Reaper's target
is dead,

04:32.305 --> 04:34.207
which means...

04:34.241 --> 04:37.444
it'll be going after
its most hated enemy:

04:37.477 --> 04:38.779
an Earp.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.447
So, your fam‐jam?

04:40.480 --> 04:43.250
She's in real danger now.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.487
Unless...

04:48.688 --> 04:50.257
No.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.625
‐ Unless what?

04:53.360 --> 04:55.395
‐ Unless we turn Billy back.

04:55.762 --> 04:58.899
(dramatic music)

04:59.900 --> 05:00.867
(screaming)

05:00.901 --> 05:02.369
‐ Vampire Doc, be gone.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.437
Let's get Cowboy Doc back,
alright, partner?

05:05.338 --> 05:08.875
‐ Argh! Holy shit that
is a ton of blood.

05:08.909 --> 05:09.943
Look.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.679
I think I'm in shock because
this is my blood, right?

05:12.712 --> 05:14.347
All of it?

05:14.381 --> 05:16.983
Oh God, we really are just
blood‐bags in the end, huh?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.618
(screaming)
‐ No, no, no.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.553
Okay, okay.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.688
Mercedes, you need to rest!

05:21.721 --> 05:23.390
I'm no doctor but‐‐

05:23.423 --> 05:24.691
‐ Yes. Stop the blood!

05:24.724 --> 05:27.194
‐ Okay, stop saying
the B‐word!

05:27.794 --> 05:30.230
‐ I believe that I could
put a stop to all of this.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.266
‐ Mr. Holliday?

05:33.300 --> 05:34.801
You saved my life,
and I'm here to save yours

05:34.835 --> 05:38.638
because I know you don't want
to eat an innocent person.

05:38.672 --> 05:43.410
‐ If I have to go through
a werewolf to reach my prize...

05:43.977 --> 05:45.278
so be it.

05:45.312 --> 05:48.215
(growling)

05:49.983 --> 05:51.518
‐ Is it working?

05:51.551 --> 05:54.354
‐ Oh, yeah. This'll free
my brother from Reaperdom.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.890
Tie you and lil' Billy together
forever now, Rach.

05:56.923 --> 05:57.691
It's what you wanted, right?

05:57.724 --> 06:00.894
‐ I'm just trying
to help everyone.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.963
(chuckling): Of course you are.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.398
Now keep squeezing
while I gather the, uh,

06:05.432 --> 06:08.501
ritualistic... sticks.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.907
(Wynonna breathing shakily)

06:20.046 --> 06:21.715
(twigs snapping)

06:21.748 --> 06:22.983
(panting)

06:23.016 --> 06:24.584
‐ Uh...

06:26.786 --> 06:28.588
(branch snapping)
It's just a branch.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.522
It's just a branch.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.758
There's branches in the woods,
you idiot.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.793
(whooshing)

06:34.628 --> 06:35.862
(Rachel): How long will it take?

06:36.563 --> 06:37.998
(Cleo): Just keep squeezing.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.399
Harder.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.972
‐ Am I doing it right?
Is it close?

06:46.006 --> 06:49.843
‐ Oh, you are so close.

06:49.876 --> 06:52.879
I can almost taste it.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.383
‐ Keep going. Get Waverly.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.719
(branch snapping)

06:59.753 --> 07:00.687
Hello?

07:02.622 --> 07:03.957
Help?

07:03.990 --> 07:05.492
If I get my sight back

07:05.525 --> 07:06.893
and you're at least
a six out of ten,

07:06.927 --> 07:09.429
I‐I will make out with you.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.331
Hello?

07:13.066 --> 07:14.734
Okay, fine a five...

07:14.768 --> 07:15.702
(softly): ...point five.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.070
(whooshing)

07:17.103 --> 07:19.539
Reaper. Reaper. Reaper.

07:20.573 --> 07:21.608
Ah!

07:21.641 --> 07:23.777
(Reaper groaning softly)

07:23.810 --> 07:26.346
(dramatic music)

07:30.517 --> 07:31.718
(softly): Waverly.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.823
Help!

07:41.161 --> 07:41.962
Ah!

07:43.964 --> 07:44.965
Just keep going.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.934
(grunting)
Waverly!

07:50.337 --> 07:52.505
(breathing heavily)

07:52.539 --> 07:54.374
(grunting)

07:57.544 --> 07:58.945
(screaming)
‐ Earp! Earp!

07:58.979 --> 08:00.547
It's okay, it's me.
It's okay. It's Billy.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.983
It's okay. Here.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.484
I picked up your gun.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.023
(gasping)

08:10.957 --> 08:12.892
(breathing heavily)

08:15.962 --> 08:17.998
‐ If you can hold Peacemaker,
then you're not...

08:19.099 --> 08:20.934
then you're not
a Reaper anymore. How?

08:20.967 --> 08:22.469
‐ I have no idea.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.304
‐ Billy, my sister...

08:27.040 --> 08:28.375
I'm...

08:30.210 --> 08:31.945
I'm blind. I can't see.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.615
‐ Then you better stay close.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.752
I got you, Earp.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.357
‐ I can't hold him off
any longer.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.593
If a vampire wants to feed,
they'll feed.

08:46.626 --> 08:49.996
‐ She's already dead.
Just let me eat her.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.836
‐ Hey, hey.

08:58.038 --> 09:02.909
Hey. I am not stopping you
for her.

09:05.612 --> 09:08.615
(whispering): I know you
don't want to do this.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.884
This is not the real you.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.655
You've made amends.
You've changed.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.958
I know it, Doc, I know it.

09:21.161 --> 09:24.064
(Mercedes crying
and moaning)

09:25.098 --> 09:28.435
(panting)

09:28.468 --> 09:30.703
(growling softly)

09:37.677 --> 09:38.678
(groaning)

09:43.750 --> 09:46.453
You want to feed? Take me.

09:46.486 --> 09:47.720
I don't care.

09:48.788 --> 09:52.826
I've lost my love, my job.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.028
And if you eat
an innocent person,

09:56.062 --> 09:58.031
then I've lost my brother too.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.933
(suspenseful music)

10:07.073 --> 10:08.808
(Jeremy panting)

10:08.842 --> 10:11.878
(sighing): Jeremy.
‐ Doc!

10:15.482 --> 10:18.184
‐ I had the most
peculiar vision.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.120
‐ In your, uh...?

10:20.153 --> 10:22.489
(chuckling softly)

10:23.723 --> 10:25.391
(softly): Thank you.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.860
I will resist.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.161
‐ I knew you would.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.931
‐ But we are still
stuck in here.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.834
‐ Ah, Mercedes.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.237
(Doc): I might have
superhuman strength,

10:37.270 --> 10:39.506
but one of me
will not be enough.

10:39.539 --> 10:43.510
‐ Werewolves plus iron bars
equals singed paws. I...

10:43.543 --> 10:45.678
‐ Guys, I am literally dying

10:45.712 --> 10:50.583
and we‐we all know that
I was born to be a vampire.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.555
‐ That is actually a good idea.

10:56.723 --> 10:57.891
‐ Are you sure?

10:57.924 --> 10:59.926
‐ I mean, if you don't,
she's a goner.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.930
‐ I never sired someone before.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.232
I will need
your express assent.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.568
‐ Consent is so important.

11:08.601 --> 11:09.869
‐ Vamp permission granted,

11:09.903 --> 11:12.172
now get over here
and suck me off already!

11:13.072 --> 11:15.909
(soft growling)

11:20.613 --> 11:22.849
(groaning)

11:25.685 --> 11:27.453
‐ Wynonna, can you hear me?

11:27.487 --> 11:28.588
(radio crackling)

11:28.621 --> 11:30.056
Where's Waverly?

11:32.125 --> 11:33.726
Okay, I'm heading back
in your direction.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.129
(male voice on radio):
...moving to...

11:36.162 --> 11:37.964
Noah...

11:37.997 --> 11:39.199
...code.
(static)

11:39.232 --> 11:40.800
No...

11:40.833 --> 11:42.168
...necessary.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.803
‐ Black Badge.
(agent): Attention.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.004
Camp 41.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.974
Moving to Noah protocol,
code red.

11:48.007 --> 11:49.509
Eliminate townspeople.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.177
No survivors necessary.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.245
‐ My townspeople.

11:54.113 --> 11:56.616
Oh, Wynonna, you better get her!
(breathing heavily)

11:56.649 --> 11:58.952
Looks like I'm going to kick
some government ass.

11:59.852 --> 12:01.621
(grunting)

12:01.654 --> 12:03.256
‐ We will not die in a cage.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.925
‐ My dental surgeon
is going to kill me.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.061
Those veneers were fresh.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.629
Guess I could just drain him.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.232
‐ We really need to work
on appetite suppression.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.866
‐ What are you,
a 90s modelling agency?

12:13.900 --> 12:16.236
I will eat who I want.
No more diets.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.737
‐ Vampin' looks good on you,
girl.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.105
(giggling)

12:19.138 --> 12:20.540
‐ Oh, Mercedes
‐ Hm?

12:20.573 --> 12:21.708
‐ Bars?

12:22.775 --> 12:24.110
‐ Let's fuck it up.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.746
(hissing, growling)

12:26.779 --> 12:29.115
(upbeat music)

12:29.682 --> 12:31.851
(alarm blaring)

12:34.821 --> 12:37.590
♪ Get away, get away,
get away ♪

12:37.624 --> 12:40.026
♪ I've got to get away ♪

12:42.762 --> 12:45.765
♪ Get away, get away,
get away ♪

12:45.798 --> 12:47.834
♪ I've got to get away ♪

12:47.867 --> 12:51.604
♪ Get away, get away,
get away, I've got to... ♪

12:51.638 --> 12:53.706
(electricity powers down,
music stops)

12:53.740 --> 12:55.041
(both): Fuck a duck.

12:55.074 --> 12:57.076
(music resumes)

13:02.048 --> 13:04.083
(birds chirping)

13:04.117 --> 13:05.952
(soft music)

13:05.985 --> 13:08.121
‐ My eyeballs
are back in business.

13:08.154 --> 13:10.590
Though apparently
there's nothing to see here.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.060
Where's Cleo? Where's Rachel?

13:18.998 --> 13:20.633
Billy, fresh blood.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.604
‐ They made me me again.

13:26.706 --> 13:27.774
‐ They saved you.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.941
‐ Probably to save you.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.278
‐ Is there any chance
your bitchster didn't

13:32.312 --> 13:33.713
take my mentee as bait?

13:33.746 --> 13:35.782
‐ No, Cleo's unhinged.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.216
Okay, she's gonna do anything
to get what she wants.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.384
‐ Well, what does she want?

13:38.418 --> 13:39.886
‐ I don't know.
We have to find out.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.888
‐ I'm going to find Waverly.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.856
‐ That's Rachel's blood.
‐ We don't know that.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.325
‐ Yes, I do!

13:45.358 --> 13:47.226
A Clanton can't unreap
another Clanton.

13:48.294 --> 13:49.429
Wynonna, she's in danger.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.165
‐ I'm not going back
to your ranch.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.833
Last time I was there...

13:54.967 --> 13:56.836
It's a trap, kid.
‐ Who cares?

13:57.804 --> 13:59.972
You have a magic gun and Rachel
needs you to save her.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.808
I severed the root.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.043
I got tortured by my own mom
to save you.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.812
‐ You were trying
to save Rachel.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.979
‐ So you owe me one.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.081
And you owe her a few.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.851
‐ There's only one of me, man!
‐ You're Wynonna Earp!

14:12.785 --> 14:14.787
Okay, Rachel used to go on
about you guys.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.090
How it was after you came back.
‐ Yeah, I was an asshole.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.392
I was a mess.
‐ No. She said it got better.

14:20.326 --> 14:21.994
That you were awesome.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.097
And she's not some
powerful angel.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.665
She's on her own.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.167
Waverly would want you to.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.002
(scoffing)

14:32.405 --> 14:34.774
‐ Low blow, Asshole Junior.

14:37.977 --> 14:40.413
(softly): Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.782
‐ If I step foot on that ranch,
I'll get re‐reaped.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.217
But um,

14:44.250 --> 14:46.219
maybe I can find someone
to help me deal with this.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.322
‐ Well, good luck.

14:49.355 --> 14:50.790
Thanks.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.358
(birds chirping)

14:56.195 --> 14:58.164
Looks like it's just
you and me.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.900
Let's do it differently
this time.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.238
And let's hope Waverly's
mellowed out by now.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.106
(dramatic music)

15:07.140 --> 15:08.708
(screaming)

15:08.741 --> 15:10.109
(indistinct shouting)

15:10.143 --> 15:12.445
(machine‐gun fire
in the distance)

15:33.866 --> 15:35.001
‐ Humans.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.137
There's always a crisis.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.013
nce!

15:47.046 --> 15:49.515
‐ Yeah! Some of these foods
are human beings!

15:49.549 --> 15:50.583
‐ Very convincing.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.986
(whirring)
(Jeremy): Oh God! The nozzles!

15:54.020 --> 15:55.588
They're gassing us!

15:55.621 --> 15:57.290
This is Monument all over again.

15:57.323 --> 16:00.092
‐ Open this door!

16:00.126 --> 16:02.462
(beeping, coughing)

16:02.495 --> 16:03.930
(door clicking)

16:03.963 --> 16:06.199
(door grinding open)

16:07.066 --> 16:08.167
‐ You won't get away with this.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.002
‐ We just did, bitch.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.170
‐ Not you.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.638
‐ It's time to get out of here,

16:12.672 --> 16:14.674
'cause Colonel Sanders here
decided to gas the place.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.176
‐ Listen, lady.
You can't let them out.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.012
They're monsters.
This one's a goddamn werewolf.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.047
‐ He's also my florist.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.516
And his name is Freddy.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.451
‐ Honestly, I prefer Fred.
‐ Not the time!

16:27.386 --> 16:29.055
Get.
‐ Let's go.

16:29.088 --> 16:29.889
(Jeremy): Go, go, go.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.324
‐ You see, General,
our town here,

16:31.357 --> 16:32.992
it's pretty inclusive.
(General): Yeah.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.694
‐ Or at least, from now on
it's gonna be.

16:34.727 --> 16:35.962
But not to your kind.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.497
‐ What is that, the military?

16:37.530 --> 16:39.065
‐ Utter dickwads.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.367
Move it and lose it.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.069
‐ Just who the hell
do you think you are?

16:43.102 --> 16:45.438
‐ I'm the goddamn sheriff
of Purgatory.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.373
You messed with the wrong town.

16:47.406 --> 16:49.208
Ah!
(grunting)

16:50.977 --> 16:52.445
(grunting)

16:52.478 --> 16:53.646
(screaming)

16:57.416 --> 16:59.218
We need to get everyone away
from this building,

16:59.252 --> 17:00.219
back to safety.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.921
‐ The fog is still closing in.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.289
There might not be
a safety left.

17:03.322 --> 17:04.357
(Nicole): Right along the side.

17:04.390 --> 17:07.727
‐ But maybe...
there is an opening.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.228
(beeping)

17:09.262 --> 17:11.197
(whirring)

17:11.230 --> 17:13.399
(indistinct screaming
in the distance)

17:13.432 --> 17:14.600
Wait a minute.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.903
‐ More fog?
God, it's everywhere.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.571
We have no time to get
Memento tattoos.

17:18.604 --> 17:22.408
‐ If this is correct,
then the fog is gone.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.311
(indistinct ethereal voice)

17:25.344 --> 17:27.113
‐ What is it, sire?

17:27.146 --> 17:28.948
There goes all my feminist
street cred.

17:28.981 --> 17:29.682
‐ Doc?

17:29.715 --> 17:31.150
‐ The heir.

17:31.183 --> 17:32.685
(ethereal whispering continues)

17:32.718 --> 17:35.054
I have to get ready.
‐ For what?

17:36.188 --> 17:38.024
‐ I don't know.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.727
All is fine.
(chuckling)

17:41.761 --> 17:45.431
‐ Okay, we need to get all these
people, and otherwise, home.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.767
‐ As an otherwise, I will not
be affected by the gas,

17:47.800 --> 17:49.402
so I'll head back in
and get any stragglers.

17:49.435 --> 17:50.736
(machine‐gun fire
in the distance)

17:50.770 --> 17:52.271
And my guns.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.241
‐ Okay, everybody, let's go!

17:55.274 --> 17:57.376
(indistinct chattering)
We're moving!

18:01.647 --> 18:03.549
(suspenseful music)

18:04.350 --> 18:06.619
(sniffing)
‐ Ugh, who beefed one?

18:06.652 --> 18:08.521
Oh, that's gnarly.

18:08.554 --> 18:11.223
(shrieking and growling)

18:19.465 --> 18:21.167
Reapers.

18:23.002 --> 18:25.004
Clanton ancestors.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.139
(shrieking and growling
continues)

18:27.173 --> 18:29.775
I will not be RSVP'ing
to this family reunion.

18:29.809 --> 18:33.379
‐ See she was a hoarder,
clearly.

18:33.412 --> 18:36.415
And in the end...
God, who cares?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.484
You know, 'cause Mam?

18:38.517 --> 18:40.052
You're cancelled.

18:40.519 --> 18:43.456
(glass breaking, chuckling)

18:43.489 --> 18:46.025
See, you probably
had a nice mom.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.427
One who didn't
train you to hate.

18:48.461 --> 18:52.131
Well, fuck that,
and fuck this family!

18:52.164 --> 18:53.499
‐ My mom was a hero.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.267
‐ Nobody cares.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.637
I am talking about me.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.505
And it is high time

18:59.538 --> 19:03.676
that my family's empire
of dirt gets buried.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.177
‐ Get away from her!

19:05.211 --> 19:08.614
‐ Oh, my, Wynonna Earp.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.349
I am so glad you came.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.785
You were such good bait,
sweetie.

19:12.818 --> 19:16.288
‐ Go!
‐ You're like a master baiter.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.591
(Cleo giggles)

19:18.624 --> 19:20.026
And now that you're here,

19:20.793 --> 19:22.461
we can finally begin.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.698
(Wynonna): Holt!
‐ Sheriff Clayborn.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.299
‐ You turned him into a Reaper.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.569
‐ Mm. No. Not me.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.071
That's just what happens to us.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.173
The Clantons.

19:34.206 --> 19:35.708
Well, except for Mam.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.276
She never got the chance,

19:37.309 --> 19:41.414
'cause she's in Holt's
lower intestines, right?

19:41.747 --> 19:42.782
(soft growling)

19:42.815 --> 19:44.150
‐ You're psychotic.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.284
‐ I'm a Clanton.

19:45.317 --> 19:47.386
The Clanton heir.

19:47.420 --> 19:51.157
But you see, Mam...
(chuckling)

19:51.190 --> 19:53.192
that bitch,

19:53.225 --> 19:55.861
she never told me
all of it, though.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.330
About the Reapers.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.332
And our ancestors.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.502
How they would follow
you around.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.772
Living in your head,
demanding revenge.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.240
Begging for food.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.476
They don't even fucking sleep!

20:10.509 --> 20:12.244
‐ Legacy's a bitch.

20:12.278 --> 20:14.180
‐ But now, big bro's back

20:14.213 --> 20:16.515
to make sure
it all goes to plan.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.683
(growling)

20:17.717 --> 20:20.386
‐ What does?
‐ Hm.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.389
‐ Cleo.

20:23.422 --> 20:24.890
(sizzling)
Call him off.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.693
Call it all off.
You can just leave.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.763
‐ You know better than anyone

20:30.796 --> 20:34.734
that you can never just leave
the Ghost River Triangle.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.235
And for me,

20:36.268 --> 20:39.805
those things always
linked to my soul?

20:40.506 --> 20:43.142
Hm. But not for long.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.712
'Cause I'm about to pass
the torch off

20:46.746 --> 20:50.783
to our family's
greatest enemy.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.551
‐ No. Don't do this.

20:53.652 --> 20:56.422
‐ And once you become heir,

20:56.455 --> 21:02.461
you will kill everyone who means
anything to you.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.296
And the worst part?

21:04.330 --> 21:05.965
You'll still be in there.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.634
Watching yourself do it.

21:11.737 --> 21:14.206
Kinda like my poor brothers.

21:15.841 --> 21:18.544
(Holt huffing)

21:18.577 --> 21:22.815
‐ I don't wanna do this again
but I will shoot another human.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.383
(roaring)

21:24.416 --> 21:25.985
Ha! Ugh!

21:26.018 --> 21:28.420
Rachel. Take this,
no matter what happens,

21:28.454 --> 21:29.421
don't give it back. Run!

21:29.455 --> 21:30.756
(Holt shrieking)

21:30.790 --> 21:33.692
(Cleo): Malediceres ad hostes.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.828
(dramatic music)

21:39.799 --> 21:44.537
(screaming and machine‐gun fire
in the distance)

21:50.009 --> 21:53.879
(ethereal voices whispering)

21:55.781 --> 21:57.750
‐ No, I will not.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.854
(screaming and gunfire continue)

22:06.292 --> 22:08.594
If you need help,
I can provide...

22:09.528 --> 22:11.463
Waverly Earp?

22:11.497 --> 22:13.332
‐ That is no longer my name.

22:14.033 --> 22:17.970
I am a scion
of the great guardian, Julian,

22:18.003 --> 22:20.406
protector of the fifth realm.

22:21.640 --> 22:22.908
‐ Okey‐dokey.

22:23.909 --> 22:26.011
Hey, we should be evacuating
this facility.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.447
‐ I will leave once my property
is returned.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.716
‐ What property?
‐ You have it.

22:30.749 --> 22:34.887
And if you will not acquiesce
to bestow it upon me,

22:34.920 --> 22:36.722
I shall take it from you.

22:37.389 --> 22:38.591
‐ The book.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.993
‐ Give it to me,
and I shall return home.

22:42.928 --> 22:44.263
‐ You are home.

22:44.296 --> 22:46.365
‐ So be it.
I shall take it from you.

22:46.398 --> 22:47.266
‐ No.

22:48.601 --> 22:49.835
‐ You dare to defy me?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.271
‐ I am doing this for my friend,
Waverly Earp.

22:52.304 --> 22:53.272
Now you get out of her.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.406
‐ I am her.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.475
‐ You sure as shit ain't.

22:57.276 --> 22:59.411
(ethereal whispers)

23:06.685 --> 23:08.621
‐ You've seen what's coming.

23:08.654 --> 23:10.756
You know what awaits you next.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.362
‐ I also know
that Wynonna taught us

23:16.395 --> 23:18.030
that there is always
another way.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.598
‐ Give me the book.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.033
‐ Come and get it.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.968
(whooshing)

23:26.839 --> 23:29.008
‐ I don't feel any different.

23:30.476 --> 23:34.046
Still hungover and eager
to fuck you up.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.681
(sighing)

23:35.714 --> 23:36.649
‐ It didn't work.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.350
(crying softly)

23:38.384 --> 23:39.685
Of course it didn't work.

23:39.718 --> 23:41.520
(laughing)

23:41.553 --> 23:43.589
Mam always said
I had shit for brains

23:43.622 --> 23:45.391
and brains for nothing.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.660
‐ I may be your greatest enemy,

23:47.693 --> 23:49.595
but I'm not the Clanton heir.

23:49.628 --> 23:50.629
(whooshing)

23:50.663 --> 23:52.498
(Doc): You are neither.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.333
I am.

24:02.007 --> 24:04.810
‐ Please, no, no, no, no!

24:04.843 --> 24:06.278
Not the cairns.

24:06.812 --> 24:08.647
Get in the middle.
(Wynonna grunting)

24:08.681 --> 24:11.884
‐ Okay, I get it, Evil Doc!
(Reaper screeching)

24:13.018 --> 24:14.720
The Reapers.

24:14.753 --> 24:17.256
‐ Every Clanton that ever was
wants to watch this,

24:17.289 --> 24:19.058
except for the coward.

24:20.025 --> 24:21.660
‐ I hope it was worth it, Cleo.

24:21.694 --> 24:25.230
‐ What? A chance to escape
a lifetime of torture

24:25.264 --> 24:27.132
and those fucking things?

24:27.166 --> 24:28.667
I guess we'll see.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.803
Good luck, Wynonna.

24:30.836 --> 24:32.705
‐ Go fuck yourself, Cleo.

24:33.706 --> 24:34.840
(Wynonna sighs)

24:36.008 --> 24:37.843
(engine starts)

24:43.716 --> 24:44.717
(grunting)

24:45.751 --> 24:47.353
Yeah. I remember this. Yeah.

24:47.386 --> 24:50.189
‐ I do not need a prison
to best you.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.791
But your fear gets them excited.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.096
‐ I can get you excited
if you let me take you home.

24:57.129 --> 24:59.932
‐ The next time I step onto Earp
whore land,

24:59.965 --> 25:03.602
it will be to coat it
in the blood of your kin.

25:03.635 --> 25:04.837
‐ Leave my friends out of this.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.271
‐ You never did.

25:06.305 --> 25:09.008
‐ They wanted to help.
‐ And now they'll die.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.811
‐ I know you're in there.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.813
Fight for God's sake,
Doc, fight!

25:15.280 --> 25:17.883
(Reaper shrieking
in the distance)

25:17.916 --> 25:20.753
‐ You will be duelling
none other than myself.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.756
Our ancestors are merely here

25:23.789 --> 25:27.192
to witness the correction
of the historical record.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.029
‐ What does that mean?

25:30.062 --> 25:31.797
‐ It means they have suffered
long enough

25:31.830 --> 25:34.233
because of the actions
of the Earps and Doc Holliday.

25:34.266 --> 25:37.669
And now, they will see what
happens when the fight is fair.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.605
The Clantons...

25:40.639 --> 25:41.774
they shall prevail.

25:41.807 --> 25:43.375
(distant shrieking)
‐ Doc Holliday,

25:43.409 --> 25:45.744
I am not fucking fighting you.

25:46.111 --> 25:47.279
I don't even have a weapon.

25:49.948 --> 25:51.116
(soft growling)

25:51.150 --> 25:52.217
‐ Wynonna.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.319
I tried to run but...

25:54.353 --> 25:55.788
(Doc): Pick up the pistol.

25:58.957 --> 26:01.760
‐ No.
‐ Pick up the pistol

26:01.794 --> 26:04.029
or the child fucking dies.

26:07.933 --> 26:09.735
‐ Alright, you want me
to do an O. K.,

26:09.768 --> 26:12.771
hey, maybe even
a Great Corral with you?

26:12.805 --> 26:14.406
I'm gonna need some assurances.

26:16.141 --> 26:17.309
(softly): Assurances?

26:18.410 --> 26:21.780
You do not set the terms, Earp.
Now grab the gun.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.682
‐ What's in it for me?

26:24.817 --> 26:27.953
I duel you, die, and then
you slaughter everyone I love?

26:27.986 --> 26:30.189
No, I'm...
You gotta give me something.

26:31.156 --> 26:34.793
‐ Her. She, I will spare.

26:34.827 --> 26:39.298
But only if you pick up
the goddamned gun.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.734
(Wynonna exhales loudly)

26:43.802 --> 26:46.071
(suspenseful music)

26:48.173 --> 26:49.975
‐ This is all your fault anyway.

26:50.008 --> 26:51.910
You used to be cool.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.145
‐ Enough!

26:53.178 --> 26:55.314
‐ I'm having a moment
with my weapon.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.916
Corral your emotions, dude.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.353
‐ You don't need to do this,
Wynonna.

27:01.386 --> 27:02.421
(gasping)

27:03.422 --> 27:06.325
(distant shrieking)

27:06.358 --> 27:07.326
‐ I want your word

27:07.359 --> 27:09.495
that not one hair
on this kid's head is hurt.

27:09.528 --> 27:11.964
‐ You have my word. Holt.

27:11.997 --> 27:12.865
(Rachel screams)

27:12.898 --> 27:14.833
‐ No! You literally‐‐
‐ That is only...

27:14.867 --> 27:19.138
...if you pick up the gun now!

27:19.171 --> 27:20.839
You bitch.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.711
(suspenseful music)

27:27.379 --> 27:28.847
(Rachel whimpers)

27:32.885 --> 27:35.053
‐ What a waste all this was,
huh?

27:36.388 --> 27:38.891
All your apologies.
Everything you did.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.194
Doc....
‐ Doc is dead.

27:42.227 --> 27:43.495
‐ He's been dead before.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.864
‐ I am the Clanton heir.

27:45.898 --> 27:48.033
‐ No, you're not.
You're a fuck‐up.

27:48.066 --> 27:50.369
You're a fuck‐up like me.

27:50.402 --> 27:53.138
But unlike me,
you've tried to be better.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.240
You're trying to be better.

27:56.241 --> 27:57.509
And you're so close.

27:57.543 --> 27:59.778
I won't let you do this.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.049
‐ Raise your pistol.

28:04.082 --> 28:05.851
It is time for a fair fight.

28:05.884 --> 28:08.086
‐ A fair fight's the only thing
I know Doc believes in for sure.

28:09.888 --> 28:11.990
‐ Everybody stay together,
let's get to the truck!

28:12.024 --> 28:13.892
Go. Go, go, go!

28:13.926 --> 28:15.994
Go, go, go!
(indistinct chattering)

28:16.028 --> 28:17.496
We're gonna send you guys
over to Shorty's

28:17.529 --> 28:19.131
to keep you safe until
we figure this out.

28:19.164 --> 28:20.299
They've got water.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.367
And alcohol. Maybe.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.573
Okay, guys, move back,
let's move back.

28:27.606 --> 28:30.008
Get down low, okay?
(man): Come on, drive.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.210
‐ Ah!
‐ Jesus!

28:31.243 --> 28:32.377
‐ Ow! My crotch is on fire!

28:32.411 --> 28:33.779
‐ You wanna take
the passenger seat?

28:34.813 --> 28:35.781
‐ No, no! What I'm feeling
down there is for you.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.182
‐ Jeremy, did you hit your head?

28:38.016 --> 28:38.417
‐ I'll get these people
to safety.

28:39.218 --> 28:39.484
But you need
to go to the stairs.

28:39.518 --> 28:40.385
‐ Why?

28:40.419 --> 28:42.821
‐ You're the only one
she won't hurt.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.857
‐ Shit!
(dramatic music)

28:45.891 --> 28:47.092
Buckle up!

28:47.125 --> 28:48.527
‐ All the booze we have left.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.295
Banana liqueur.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.898
Water.

28:52.931 --> 28:54.366
(inhaling)

28:55.934 --> 28:57.402
I'll call ya a Banana Shit.

28:57.436 --> 29:00.939
(sighing)
‐ Nedley! Nedley!

29:00.973 --> 29:02.975
‐ Appreciate
the enthusiasm, son,

29:03.008 --> 29:05.477
but you're only getting juice.
‐ No, Randy. It's me.

29:06.311 --> 29:07.446
‐ Invisible monster teen.

29:07.479 --> 29:08.614
‐ I have a body again.

29:08.647 --> 29:09.982
‐ Yeah, you've really
filled out.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.316
‐ Whole lot of spells,

29:11.350 --> 29:13.252
whole lot of stuff
going down with my family.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.820
The Clantons.
I need your help.

29:14.853 --> 29:16.455
Please. Nedley.

29:16.488 --> 29:17.923
They might kill Rachel.

29:18.824 --> 29:19.992
And Wynonna.

29:21.493 --> 29:22.327
‐ What?

29:22.361 --> 29:23.929
‐ But maybe, uh,

29:23.962 --> 29:25.864
if we can use this to make
myself the Clanton heir.

29:25.897 --> 29:27.132
I don't know.

29:27.165 --> 29:28.967
You any good with incantations?

29:28.967 --> 29:32.237
(soft country music
in the background)

29:34.873 --> 29:36.942
(thudding)

29:36.975 --> 29:38.610
It's very Midsommar.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.846
‐ Never saw it.
Was a barnacle monster.

29:40.879 --> 29:42.180
‐ Let's get to work.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.315
(dramatic music)

29:43.348 --> 29:45.651
(Doc): Be ready...
(Holt growls)

29:45.684 --> 29:47.986
...to snap her neck.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.454
‐ Be ready to eat a bullet.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.256
‐ You don't have to save me,
Wynonna.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.892
You already did it once.
‐ I know exactly one thing

29:53.925 --> 29:55.861
that's about
to happen here, kid.

29:56.561 --> 29:58.063
I got you.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.068
‐ Five.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.103
Four.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.938
Three.
‐ ...some?

30:06.972 --> 30:08.674
Stop now, I'll think about it.

30:08.707 --> 30:10.175
‐ Two.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.577
One.
(gun clicks, sharp inhalation)

30:14.479 --> 30:17.049
I want what is owed to us!
Your life.

30:17.082 --> 30:19.151
Now, turn around and face me!

30:19.184 --> 30:20.552
(exhales softly)

30:21.553 --> 30:24.056
‐ Doc Holliday won't shoot
someone in the back.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.091
You're still in there.
I know you are.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.060
And I know your code.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.395
The one I never
should have broken

30:30.429 --> 30:31.997
because of what
it did to us.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.699
That code won't let you
shoot me

30:33.732 --> 30:35.567
no matter what
they've done to you.

30:39.037 --> 30:41.373
‐ The Clantons have no code.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.275
(gunshot)

30:44.576 --> 30:46.378
(gunshot)

30:48.547 --> 30:49.715
‐ Rachel, run!

30:49.748 --> 30:51.416
(Rachel pants)

30:52.250 --> 30:53.151
You fired?

30:54.486 --> 30:57.322
(soft music)

30:59.424 --> 31:01.593
You loaded it with
the wrong bullets.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.996
You knew what was coming.

31:06.331 --> 31:08.066
‐ I think I've always known.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.501
(softly): John Henry...

31:09.534 --> 31:12.537
‐ The Reapers,
they are coming!

31:12.571 --> 31:14.373
(distant shrieking)

31:14.406 --> 31:17.342
‐ You okay?
‐ Keep going!

31:17.376 --> 31:21.113
‐ May the name return
to its rightful place.

31:22.748 --> 31:23.749
Where's the tooth?

31:23.782 --> 31:26.218
(screaming)

31:26.251 --> 31:27.652
‐ More!

31:27.686 --> 31:32.624
‐ Rooted together, forever,
one family, one soul.

31:32.657 --> 31:34.292
Aligned.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.460
Repair the root!

31:35.494 --> 31:40.332
‐ I command my kin, my flesh,
my blood to stand down!

31:40.365 --> 31:42.434
Stand down!

31:45.437 --> 31:47.572
Stand down!

31:47.606 --> 31:49.040
‐ How do we end them?

31:49.074 --> 31:53.178
‐ They have stopped,
but not for long.

31:53.979 --> 31:55.013
You finish...

31:57.149 --> 31:59.151
...what I started.

32:00.152 --> 32:01.420
(shaky voice):
I'm not doing this.

32:01.453 --> 32:04.623
‐ I am the last
of the O. K. Corral.

32:04.656 --> 32:06.458
‐ You were a bunch
of drunk cowboys.

32:06.491 --> 32:07.993
This is not worth dying over.

32:08.026 --> 32:10.595
‐ But everything else I did is.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.631
All those years
of selfish rage.

32:12.664 --> 32:15.467
Becoming a vampire for just
a little more life.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.602
‐ I want you in this life!

32:17.636 --> 32:21.306
‐ I do not want this, anymore.

32:23.375 --> 32:26.044
All I ever really wanted was...

32:28.447 --> 32:30.148
You kill them.

32:32.517 --> 32:34.019
The Reapers stop.

32:35.086 --> 32:36.521
My pain stops.

32:38.023 --> 32:39.491
‐ And mine never ends.

32:39.524 --> 32:41.560
(crying softly)

32:42.694 --> 32:45.197
‐ Wynonna Earp,

32:45.230 --> 32:47.232
this is the last thing that...

32:47.265 --> 32:49.601
(whimpering): No.
‐ ...I will ever ask of you.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.539
‐ We both know this is wrong.

32:55.340 --> 32:56.408
‐ Thank you.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.344
‐ There's always another way.

33:01.379 --> 33:03.048
(Waverly): Or perhaps a miracle.

33:03.081 --> 33:05.617
(dramatic music)

33:10.288 --> 33:12.424
Humans are so curious.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.427
They know their fate is sealed

33:15.460 --> 33:17.829
but they never stop trying
to change it.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.965
‐ Waverly...

33:19.998 --> 33:22.634
...or whatever the fuck
you are now, you could save him.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.439
‐ He does have regret
in his heart

33:27.472 --> 33:29.574
for his many, many sins.

33:30.609 --> 33:33.478
But he defied the lifetime
he was given.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.580
Many, many times.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.349
‐ Yeah, big whoop. You...

33:37.382 --> 33:39.885
...you left the Garden.
You got off the throne.

33:39.918 --> 33:42.287
‐ You convinced her... me...

33:43.588 --> 33:44.789
to do so.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.858
‐ I'm saying we all
make mistakes.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.662
I'm the Earp heir, remember?

33:50.695 --> 33:52.397
‐ The Champion.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.672
I gave so much.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.708
I lost everything.

34:10.315 --> 34:12.851
If you're taking her away
from me too...

34:15.086 --> 34:18.490
at least let my sister save
the man we both love.

34:19.624 --> 34:20.692
(softly): Please.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.696
Before you go away forever.

34:28.099 --> 34:30.835
‐ I must take the book
he possesses back to the Garden.

34:35.974 --> 34:37.475
‐ Save him first.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.845
(eerie suspenseful music)

34:49.854 --> 34:52.591
(soft eerie music)

34:54.593 --> 34:56.828
(astral chiming,
Wynonna crying softly)

35:02.167 --> 35:05.604
(loud reverberating, glitching)

35:05.637 --> 35:07.572
(gasping)

35:13.445 --> 35:14.713
(Doc): What did you do?

35:15.814 --> 35:17.415
Something is different.

35:20.552 --> 35:23.655
‐ Hm. These bodies
are so fragile.

35:28.593 --> 35:30.528
‐ Please don't go.

35:36.067 --> 35:38.103
‐ Waverly did this for you.

35:40.171 --> 35:42.073
Your sister loved you
very much, Wynonna.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.582
(whimpering, sniffling)

35:55.186 --> 35:57.756
(distant shrieking)

35:57.789 --> 35:59.824
(Holt): Please.

36:02.060 --> 36:04.596
(groaning)

36:04.629 --> 36:05.997
This...

36:06.031 --> 36:08.500
not... me.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.769
I want...

36:10.802 --> 36:12.871
I‐I didn't...

36:14.506 --> 36:16.007
‐ You're right.

36:16.041 --> 36:17.876
You don't.

36:17.909 --> 36:18.977
(whooshing)

36:19.010 --> 36:20.945
(zapping)

36:22.113 --> 36:23.948
(birds calling)

36:28.620 --> 36:30.955
(soft rumbling)

36:33.024 --> 36:34.926
(Nicole panting)

36:34.959 --> 36:36.828
‐ Waverly!

36:36.861 --> 36:37.962
Waverly!

36:38.697 --> 36:39.864
(groaning in pain)

36:39.898 --> 36:41.232
‐ Go home, Nicole Haught.

36:41.266 --> 36:42.801
This is none of your concern.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.903
‐ None of my concern?

36:44.936 --> 36:46.137
You're gonna be my wife.

36:46.171 --> 36:48.940
‐ The gate must close,
once and for all.

36:48.973 --> 36:50.675
And I must be the one to do it.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.777
(ethereal thud, panting)

36:52.811 --> 36:55.013
‐ I got left behind before,
and I'm not doing that again.

36:55.046 --> 36:58.116
Where you go, I go, remember?

36:58.149 --> 37:00.518
‐ The Garden is not
for your kind.

37:01.653 --> 37:02.787
Human.

37:02.821 --> 37:03.788
‐ No.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.690
‐ I am the Guardian.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.826
I am the fail‐safe.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.828
I must protect
the Ghost River Triangle.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.197
‐ What about Wynonna?

37:13.231 --> 37:14.799
‐ The Champion.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.270
The only one who can
wield the sword.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.707
But she has served enough.
‐ Okay, okay!

37:22.741 --> 37:24.776
Let's figure this out.
(panting)

37:24.809 --> 37:27.712
I am the Sheriff of Purgatory.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.782
Let me extend my watch over
all of the Ghost River Triangle,

37:30.815 --> 37:31.649
in every realm.

37:31.683 --> 37:34.652
Let me be the Guardian
for all of us,

37:34.686 --> 37:36.121
supernatural and human.

37:36.154 --> 37:39.157
‐ You'd sacrifice your life
to become the Shield?

37:39.190 --> 37:41.059
‐ Every day until
the end of eternity

37:41.092 --> 37:42.527
if it meant
keeping you safe.

37:43.728 --> 37:46.898
‐ Well, I have already
broken the rules once.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.199
For John Henry Holliday.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.134
‐ Yeah, see?

37:49.167 --> 37:51.102
It feels kind of good
now and then, right?

37:51.136 --> 37:52.237
So what's one more?

37:55.807 --> 37:56.808
Look in the book.

37:56.841 --> 38:00.044
Your story is my story.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.815
‐ The book was ill begotten.

38:03.848 --> 38:05.850
It belongs to the Garden,
as do I.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.685
‐ Please, just look.

38:09.587 --> 38:12.023
(Waverly breaths loudly)

38:12.056 --> 38:13.258
(gasping)

38:13.291 --> 38:15.226
‐ Am I in there?

38:16.561 --> 38:17.262
Are we?

38:18.897 --> 38:21.166
‐ It would be a steep price
to pay.

38:21.199 --> 38:23.101
You would be bound
to the Ghost River Triangle.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.602
You could never leave.

38:26.104 --> 38:28.206
‐ Everything I love
is already here.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.044
(loud hum, grunting)

38:33.077 --> 38:34.612
(zapping)

38:34.646 --> 38:37.248
(dramatic music)

38:37.282 --> 38:39.217
(ethereal voice): I swear
to be bound

38:39.250 --> 38:42.120
to the Ghost River Triangle
for all of my days.

38:42.954 --> 38:47.258
I swear to be patient and just,
for there is no other way.

38:47.959 --> 38:51.596
I swear my life to protecting
the Ghost River Triangle.

38:52.263 --> 38:54.699
I am the Angel's Shield.

38:56.267 --> 38:58.670
(zapping, grunting)

39:03.908 --> 39:05.643
(gasping)

39:05.677 --> 39:07.612
(droning, door clicks shut)

39:08.279 --> 39:10.081
‐ Nicole!

39:11.950 --> 39:13.117
Nicole!

39:14.152 --> 39:15.753
Baby, Nicole!

39:15.787 --> 39:17.088
Come on, Nicole, please!

39:17.121 --> 39:18.690
Hey.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.662
(Nicole inhales)

39:26.164 --> 39:27.098
‐ Huh...

39:28.399 --> 39:31.102
(gasping in pain)
‐ What's wrong?

39:40.144 --> 39:41.346
Oh, sweetheart.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.648
You sacrificed yourself for me.

39:44.649 --> 39:46.317
‐ Don't oversell it, baby.

39:46.351 --> 39:48.786
I only committed
to a permanent staycation

39:48.820 --> 39:50.655
with my girl.

39:52.323 --> 39:53.825
(Nicole chuckling)

40:03.968 --> 40:06.471
(Graham groaning)

40:06.504 --> 40:07.472
‐ Soldier!

40:07.505 --> 40:09.540
You need to call
BBD headquarters.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.642
Call in the army.
Call everyone!

40:10.675 --> 40:12.310
(alarm blaring in the distance)

40:12.343 --> 40:14.412
‐ Yeah...
We're not gonna do that.

40:14.445 --> 40:16.281
(telephone ringing)

40:17.215 --> 40:18.416
Chetri.

40:19.317 --> 40:21.119
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

40:21.152 --> 40:22.620
It's all under control.

40:24.055 --> 40:25.423
General Graham?

40:25.456 --> 40:28.092
No. Unfortunately,
he didn't make it.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.598
‐ You'd take their side?
These demons?

40:33.631 --> 40:35.500
This is insubordination
of the highest degree.

40:35.533 --> 40:36.701
This is treason!

40:36.734 --> 40:38.469
‐ No. This is Purgatory.

40:38.503 --> 40:40.738
And I am done letting
Black Badge fuck it up

40:40.772 --> 40:42.440
for everyone
who has to live here.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.043
Freddy?

40:46.778 --> 40:47.679
(growling)

40:47.712 --> 40:48.746
Supper's up.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.748
(growling, Graham screaming)

40:54.452 --> 40:57.088
‐ Nedley has Rachel and Billy.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.723
He's taking them to the city
for burgers.

40:58.756 --> 41:00.491
‐ It's amazing they can travel
to the big city.

41:00.525 --> 41:01.759
‐ Well, we all can now.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.695
Anywhere we want.

41:04.562 --> 41:05.530
‐ Hey.

41:07.198 --> 41:09.534
‐ Darlin', I already have
four blankets.

41:09.567 --> 41:10.501
I'm very hot.

41:10.535 --> 41:12.370
‐ Yes. Yes, you are,

41:12.403 --> 41:13.771
but you shouldn't say it
out loud.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.707
Can I get you anything else?

41:15.740 --> 41:18.776
‐ Thank you but, uh, I am good.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.411
‐ The best.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.613
(Nicole clears throat)

41:22.647 --> 41:24.315
‐ Honestly, Haught,
you can't just interrupt

41:24.349 --> 41:25.283
intimate moments like that.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.085
‐ Oh. Okay. Ha, ha.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.619
Um, guys.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.722
Can we talk about
the issue at hand?

41:31.789 --> 41:33.391
‐ Dark Angel me?

41:34.392 --> 41:36.194
Well, she seems to be gone.

41:36.227 --> 41:37.261
For now.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.365
Thanks to my Angel's Shield.

41:40.398 --> 41:41.566
(coughing): I helped a bit.

41:41.599 --> 41:43.735
‐ You're still The Champion.

41:43.768 --> 41:45.203
And the Earp heir.

41:45.236 --> 41:46.838
And my favourite sister.

41:47.805 --> 41:49.574
Top two. Top two.

41:50.608 --> 41:52.677
‐ No, guys I'm talking ab‐‐
‐ Oh, no. Black Badge.

41:52.710 --> 41:53.678
Of course.

41:53.711 --> 41:55.413
They've retreated from the GRT.

41:55.446 --> 41:57.815
But if they come back,
we'll be ready.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.754
‐ Doc, what is it?
(exhaling softly)

42:03.588 --> 42:05.356
‐ My reflection.

42:09.427 --> 42:10.361
I have one.

42:10.395 --> 42:12.196
‐ You devamped him?

42:12.230 --> 42:14.399
‐ I don't know
if I could have...

42:15.833 --> 42:17.602
...unless he wanted me to.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.507
‐ Did you want to?

42:26.811 --> 42:28.546
‐ I want a fresh start.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.315
To everything.

42:33.584 --> 42:35.253
(Nicole clears throat)

42:35.286 --> 42:37.855
‐ Honestly, Nicole, I am
very single, let me have this!

42:37.889 --> 42:40.625
‐ I'm sorry, okay.
I want to talk about it!

42:44.328 --> 42:45.797
The wedding.

42:46.931 --> 42:49.500
Are you gonna marry me, or what?

42:49.534 --> 42:50.835
‐ Yes, please.

42:50.868 --> 42:52.670
‐ Let's have ourselves
a wedding!

42:56.474 --> 42:59.177
(theme song)

43:02.346 --> 43:05.883
Subtitling: difuze
