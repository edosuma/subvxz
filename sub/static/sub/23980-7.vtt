00:03.000 --> 00:04.520
# We're not going out

00:04.520 --> 00:06.320
# Not staying in

00:06.320 --> 00:09.680
# Just hanging around
With my head in a spin

00:09.680 --> 00:11.880
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

00:11.880 --> 00:15.000
# We're not going out

00:15.000 --> 00:18.800
♪ We are not going out. ♪

00:26.360 --> 00:27.760
How about this one?

00:27.760 --> 00:30.320
Yep, that looks great, I like it.

00:30.320 --> 00:33.480
OK, how about this one?

00:35.520 --> 00:36.880
Yeah, that's nice as well.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.240
Why do you need a dress, anyway?
You've already got a dress.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.880
I thought I'd go crazy
and own two dresses.

00:43.880 --> 00:46.720
I was getting jealous, what with
you owning two pairs of underpants.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.280
I just want one thing
that makes me feel like a woman,

00:51.280 --> 00:53.240
besides three kids
and stretch marks.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.240
Can I help you?

00:58.240 --> 01:00.960
Just trying to work out whether I
can get away without wearing a bra.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.560
Hm, well, you won't get
much support.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.200
I'm used to that.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.680
Hey, Pluto, you look great!

01:09.760 --> 01:11.280
Remember those days, dear?

01:11.280 --> 01:14.720
Yeah, all bouncy and full of life.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.560
Well, gravity makes fools of us all.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.200
I meant the girls, not... Well, it's
what happens when you have children.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.800
How do you know I've got children?

01:24.040 --> 01:25.600
Oh, you've got children.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.120 --> 01:36.600
Do you think those are real?

01:36.600 --> 01:39.440
No, definitely not,
they're way too spherical.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.200
Real ones are more misshapen.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.480
You are talking about the pearls?

01:44.480 --> 01:46.280
No, her breasts.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.680
Oh, right.

01:47.680 --> 01:51.120
No, definitely not,
they're way too spherical.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.000
Real ones are more misshapen.

01:54.040 --> 01:58.880
Would you ever consider it?
A boob job♪ I don't think so.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.520
It's a bit tacky, isn't it?

02:00.520 --> 02:02.320
Not necessarily.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.120
Showing them off in a magazine

02:04.120 --> 02:07.000
that comes with a free sachet
of Horlicks might be.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.320
No, boob jobs are for vain, insecure
types with more money than sense.

02:12.360 --> 02:15.280
Actually, Lucy, I've had it done.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.120
Yeah, but that's different,
you know, because...

02:22.560 --> 02:24.000
No, I've got nothing.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.840
I just mean there are other
procedures I'd have done first,

02:27.840 --> 02:30.440
like removing my foot from my mouth
and putting it on my ankle.

02:30.440 --> 02:33.880
So, um, when did you have it done?

02:33.880 --> 02:35.840
Just after Jack was born.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.560
You let a little lodger
live inside you for nine months

02:38.560 --> 02:40.360
and they just trash the place.

02:40.360 --> 02:44.160
If your body was a studio flat,
they'd never get the deposit back.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.960
It's the best thing I've ever done.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.360
It made me feel much better
about myself.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.120
Have you tried the pencil test?

02:51.120 --> 02:53.960
The what♪ You know, you place
a pencil under each breast,

02:53.960 --> 02:56.040
if they don't fall to the floor,

02:56.040 --> 02:59.480
you know things aren't quite
as pert as they used to be.

02:59.480 --> 03:04.280
Mind you, in this digital age,
who uses a pencil any more?

03:04.280 --> 03:07.120
Well, I reckon I could get
a couple of iPads under there now.

03:11.240 --> 03:13.560
So I was saying all this stuff
about boob jobs

03:13.560 --> 03:15.440
and it turns out
Anna's had one done.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.880
She's had one done?
Wouldn't that make her lopsided?

03:17.880 --> 03:20.440
By the way, why have two pencils
suddenly appeared

03:20.440 --> 03:22.760
next to the bathroom mirror?

03:24.400 --> 03:25.880
No idea.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.160
Well, it doesn't surprise me
Anna's had a boob job,

03:28.160 --> 03:29.680
she's the type that would do that.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.200
Oh, and what type is that?

03:31.200 --> 03:32.800
Oh, you know, vain and shallow.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.960
She'd probably have her legs
cut off

03:34.960 --> 03:37.120
if she thought Gucci
made designer ones.

03:38.360 --> 03:39.600
Look at this.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.680
Oh, it's all right for you to read
these magazines, but not me?

03:45.720 --> 03:46.960
Look at this woman's breasts.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.400
I won't, and you can't make me.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.800
It's that posh actress
you like from Casualty.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.720
She's had a boob job.

03:57.840 --> 04:01.960
Has she♪ Well, it's put me off,
knowing she's fake.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.600
I bet she's not even a real nurse.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.440
Celebrities, eh?

04:06.440 --> 04:09.400
Well, it's not just celebrities
that get it done, you know.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.720
Well, you wouldn't consider it,
would you?

04:14.320 --> 04:15.800
Oh, I see.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.839
Anna's had a boob job
and now you want one.

04:18.839 --> 04:21.680
It's the Nespresso frother
all over again.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.640
Look, I'm only vaguely
thinking about it.

04:23.640 --> 04:26.120
I'd probably never do it.
But there's no harm in us

04:26.120 --> 04:29.080
just having a little chat about it,
is there?

04:30.320 --> 04:32.400
OK, let's chat.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.960
All right. What do you want to know?

04:34.960 --> 04:36.680
How much does it cost?

04:38.560 --> 04:40.320
That's your first question?

04:40.320 --> 04:42.400
All right, well,
what is a good question?

04:42.400 --> 04:44.280
Can you get one big one
and one small one?

04:44.280 --> 04:46.400
It costs less than
that ride-on lawn mower

04:46.400 --> 04:47.960
you seem to think we need so much.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.000
Yeah, but you can't sit
on a new pair of boobs

04:50.000 --> 04:51.480
and scream, "Vroom-vroom."

04:52.640 --> 04:54.120
You can if you ask nicely.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.040
All right, the most
important question: why?

04:58.040 --> 05:00.600
Oh, I don't know.
I just feel like I'm getting older

05:00.600 --> 05:03.200
and things aren't where
they used to be.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.400
You know, when I was in my twenties,
I once went out in a bikini top

05:06.400 --> 05:08.760
and a man crashed into a viaduct.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.320
Now, the only way my boobs
would cause a car crash is

05:11.320 --> 05:14.320
if I got one
caught under the brake pedal.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.800
I can't believe that you would talk
to Anna about this before me.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.640
Oh, we were only chatting about it.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.560
We're women, we sometimes like to

05:24.560 --> 05:26.720
talk about things like boob jobs,
OK?

05:26.720 --> 05:30.000
Blimey! Did Germaine Greer jump
in front of that horse for nothing?

05:31.320 --> 05:33.920
Why are you so dead
against the idea?

05:33.920 --> 05:35.720
How would you feel
if I suddenly announced

05:35.720 --> 05:37.120
I wanted a penis enlargement?

05:38.360 --> 05:39.600
I'd say you didn't need it.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.880
You paused!

05:41.880 --> 05:44.560
Look, can we talk about this later?
I need to go to the supermarket.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.680
I'll come with you.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.720
Don't worry,
Asda hasn't started doing boob jobs.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.640
I wish they would.
Buy one, get one free.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.960
Why on Earth would you want
to get a boob job?

06:00.960 --> 06:03.200
Oh, for God's sake,
I didn't say I wanted one,

06:03.200 --> 06:06.600
I just said I wanted to talk about
it, you know, like a normal couple?

06:06.600 --> 06:09.640
We are a normal couple, and
so are those. So leave them alone.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.720
This has really
got to you, hasn't it?

06:12.720 --> 06:15.360
Oh, I'm sorry, Lucy, but I just
feel like someone's trying to take

06:15.360 --> 06:18.360
my favourite local pub and turn it
into a shiny new Wetherspoons.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.200
My breasts are not like a pub.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.080
Oh, I don't know,
they're both places

06:22.080 --> 06:24.440
I frequent a lot less
since we had the kids.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.920
Am I missing something here?

06:25.920 --> 06:28.560
What part of our marriage vows said
they're as much yours as mine?

06:28.560 --> 06:29.680
"To have and to hold."

06:31.400 --> 06:32.880
Bloody Anna!

06:32.880 --> 06:34.560
This isn't because of Anna.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.360
Do you really think
I'm that shallow?

06:36.360 --> 06:38.760
No, but she is. She's not that bad.

06:38.760 --> 06:42.360
Yes, she is.
So self-obsessed, so up herself.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.400
I'm telling you, those fake boobs
are the only thing stopping Anna

06:45.400 --> 06:47.040
disappearing up her own backside.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.120
Hello.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.760
I don't suppose you heard that,
did you?

06:54.760 --> 06:56.760
No, I didn't hear anything.

06:56.760 --> 06:57.920
Right.

06:57.920 --> 07:01.120
How could I have, with my head
shoved so far up my backside?

07:02.680 --> 07:06.400
Bing-bong!
Social awkwardness in aisle nine.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.920
Can we have a metaphorical
mop and bucket, please?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.680
Oh, look, they've got Marmite.
I love Marmite.

07:14.680 --> 07:19.120
No, you don't, Toby, you hate it.
Just like you hate confrontation.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.800
Well, I'm surprised to see
you two in here.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.600
Obviously. Well, you know,
we like to try out new places

07:24.600 --> 07:25.640
to argue in public.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.760
Waitrose is closed for a refurb,

07:28.760 --> 07:30.600
so we're seeing how
the other half lives.

07:31.680 --> 07:35.520
It's charming, like being on safari.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.520
Why don't we go and grab a coffee,
Lee?

07:38.520 --> 07:41.640
I'm feeling dangerously
under-caffeinated and un-anxious.

07:41.640 --> 07:45.280
Yes, what a good idea,
you two go to the man creche

07:45.280 --> 07:47.720
and I'll see if I can find
pak choi in this hell hole.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.680
Aisle two.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.520
But here they call it,
"I can't believe it's not cabbage".

08:00.600 --> 08:03.040
You never told me
that Anna had had a boob job.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.640
Oh, I'm sorry, we did apply
for planning permission,

08:05.640 --> 08:07.760
so the council should
have put the notices up.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.400
How did you, er, feel about it?

08:13.680 --> 08:15.880
Could we talk about
something less personal?

08:15.880 --> 08:18.040
Like how often we have sex,

08:18.040 --> 08:21.200
or what style she likes
to wax her bikini line?

08:21.200 --> 08:24.680
I'm going for every fourth Wednesday
and conservatively vajazzled.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.600
Come on, how did you feel about it?

08:29.600 --> 08:31.600
I wasn't massively keen
to start with.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.840
I think society has too narrow
a view of female beauty.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.400
That's good, I might use that line.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.640
Plus, as a doctor,
I was worried that

08:38.640 --> 08:42.440
even administering a regionalised
neuroleptic anaesthesia could result

08:42.440 --> 08:44.520
in post-operative systemic toxicity.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.880
I probably won't use that line.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.680
So what's your objection to Lucy
having breast augmentation?

08:53.760 --> 08:56.640
Breast augmentation is a boob job,
Lee.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.160
The medical term is breasts,
not boobs or jugs.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.960
Or chesticles.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.680
I'll tell you my objections.
Where does it stop?

09:06.680 --> 09:08.520
She might start
whittling away at herself

09:08.520 --> 09:10.200
until she's just
a big toe in a bikini.

09:11.280 --> 09:14.680
I don't want her to change,
she looks really great.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.080
And you tell her that, do you?

09:16.080 --> 09:18.040
Yeah.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.840
Sort of.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.440
How often?

09:21.440 --> 09:24.160
What♪ When was the last time
you paid her a proper compliment?

09:24.160 --> 09:25.960
A few weeks ago.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.400
I said she had nice hair.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.760
All right, I said
she had a lot of hair.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.120
You know, luscious and thick.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.920
If those are your pet names
for each other,

09:36.920 --> 09:39.000
I'm assuming that she's Luscious.

09:40.840 --> 09:44.200
If you are so against the idea
of her changing the way she is,

09:44.200 --> 09:46.840
why not try complimenting her
on the way she looks now?

09:46.840 --> 09:49.000
Maybe you're right.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.960
"Lots of hair!"

09:50.960 --> 09:53.920
Yeah, all right!
I was unblocking the shower.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.200
I'm home, my beautiful princess.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.040
Oh, hello.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.800
I got you these.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.160
Lamppost or gravestone?

10:13.080 --> 10:14.800
I'm not that crass.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.840
The Esso garage.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.080
Aw. What brought this on?

10:20.080 --> 10:22.880
Well, I was just looking at you
in the supermarket aisle

10:22.880 --> 10:24.560
and I thought, phwoar!

10:26.440 --> 10:27.840
You should be writing these down.

10:27.840 --> 10:31.160
Since Barry White's death, there's
an opening for a new Walrus Of Love.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.960
I was looking at your face
and your smile, your hair,

10:35.960 --> 10:39.040
your beautiful, shiny,
correct amount of hair.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.600
And I was thinking, you're as
stunning now as the day we met.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.560
In fact, more so now you're
not wearing a velour tracksuit.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.440
They were very fashionable
back then. Yeah.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.080
It's amazing what we found
attractive back in the noughties.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.600
You're telling me.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.920
Anyway, you were gorgeous then,
and you're gorgeous now.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.040
And you've got an amazing body.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.360
Is that right♪ Yeah.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.080
Especially given that you've had
three beautiful children.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.440
Sorry?

11:08.840 --> 11:10.520
You're perfect.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.880
What, you mean for a woman
whose body has been used

11:12.880 --> 11:14.800
as an all-you-can-eat baby buffet?

11:15.840 --> 11:17.000
I didn't mean that.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.800
Well, that's what it sounded like.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.640
Is that all this is about, to stop
me thinking about having a boob job?

11:21.640 --> 11:24.880
No.
And it's called breast augmentation.

11:24.880 --> 11:29.280
But now that you mention it, I don't
think you should be considering it.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.520
I think your boobs are fine.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.120
Fine?

11:32.120 --> 11:33.960
Not fine, good.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.040
Oh, thanks, Mr Ofsted, I hope
they don't get downgraded

11:37.040 --> 11:38.240
to "satisfactory".

11:41.960 --> 11:45.200
This is stupid, Lucy, you know
I'm more of an arse man, anyway.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.840
Arse man?

11:52.320 --> 11:55.800
Arse man♪ What's that?
Some kind of superhero?

11:57.120 --> 12:00.200
The Incredible Arse Man,
cursed to roam the Earth

12:00.200 --> 12:02.680
with all the powers
of a total arse?

12:03.600 --> 12:05.600
Lucy, you're being ridiculous.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.920
Well, maybe I am, but how come you
always get first dibs on that one?

12:08.920 --> 12:11.800
Can't I be ridiculous for once
and you be the sensible one?

12:11.800 --> 12:14.480
Might make a zesty change of pace
in this household.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.760
I cannot believe that
you are thinking of conforming

12:16.760 --> 12:18.680
to society's narrow view
of female beauty.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.560
Oh, don't start preaching to me

12:20.560 --> 12:22.400
about how women are viewed
in society.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.960
You switched off Countdown because
Rachel Riley was wearing a cardigan!

12:28.320 --> 12:30.920
I've made a lot of sacrifices
for this family

12:30.920 --> 12:33.880
and I just feel like
it's time I did something for me.

12:33.880 --> 12:37.600
Even if it seems silly
and irrational to you.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.360
What, and I don't get
any say at all?

12:39.360 --> 12:42.760
No, you don't,
because you don't own my body, Lee.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.080
Oh, well, that's interesting,

12:44.080 --> 12:46.560
cos when I wanted to get that
tattoo, you were dead against it.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.920
Well, it is one thing
admiring Laurel and Hardy,

12:48.920 --> 12:51.080
it is another thing committing them
to each buttock.

12:51.080 --> 12:54.760
But, yes, maybe I should have
been more supportive.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.920
So, if you still want to get
a tattoo, Lee, you have my blessing.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.480
Ah, right, but only if you get a
boob job. What's that, tit for tat?

13:05.160 --> 13:08.120
You know what, Lee, I was only
ever considering doing this.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.600
But thanks for making me realise
I do want to do it.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.320
I'm going to call Anna
and I'm going to ask her to give me

13:13.320 --> 13:17.480
the name of her surgeon,
whether you like it or not.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.480
Fine,
well, maybe I'll get that tattoo,

13:19.480 --> 13:21.560
and then you can kiss my...
Stan and Olly.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.600
I knew I shouldn't have
listened to you.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.560
Don't blame me because you're
terrible at paying compliments.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.960
No, I'm not. Yes, you are.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.720
What did you say about my new shoes?

13:37.720 --> 13:39.440
I don't know.

13:39.440 --> 13:43.000
You said, "Ooh, they look comfy."

13:43.000 --> 13:44.200
What's wrong with that?

13:44.200 --> 13:47.200
It suggests that they're practical,
yet boring.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.840
Well, I thought they suited you.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.600
I just wanted Lucy
to feel good about herself

13:52.600 --> 13:53.960
and now I've made matters worse.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.560
And now your bloody wife is round
our house helping her pick out

13:56.560 --> 13:58.320
new nipples from a catalogue.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.920
I wasn't sure about
Anna's augmentation either,

14:02.920 --> 14:05.120
but then I saw how happy
she was afterwards.

14:05.120 --> 14:08.040
She was more confident,
she walked with her head held high

14:08.040 --> 14:09.200
and her shoulders back.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.600
To stop her toppling over?

14:12.320 --> 14:14.760
Lucy doesn't need help
picking nipples from a catalogue.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.840
She's clearly fine at choosing tits.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.280
Sorry.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.360
Can I give you some advice?

14:24.600 --> 14:26.480
Be supportive of her decision.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.640
Go with her to the consultation.
Be by her side,

14:29.640 --> 14:32.680
help her do something she clearly
thinks is going to make her happy.

14:32.680 --> 14:36.280
Oh, you're right.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.840
Of course you are.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.440
I haven't really been considering
Lucy's feelings, have I?

14:41.720 --> 14:44.040
I'm going to tell her
I support her in her wishes.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.920
Thanks, Toby.

14:45.920 --> 14:49.240
Do you want another♪ Yeah, why not?
They should get bigger cups.

14:49.240 --> 14:50.720
Don't you start.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.440
Sorry about what was said earlier.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.520
Which bit?

15:04.520 --> 15:06.680
Am I vain, insecure,
more money than sense,

15:06.680 --> 15:08.280
or have I got my head
up my backside?

15:08.280 --> 15:09.360
All of them.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.560
I mean, I'm sorry about all of them.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.840
I was a bit dismissive about people
who've had cosmetic surgery.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.880
And so was Lee.

15:18.880 --> 15:19.920
Exactly.

15:19.920 --> 15:25.200
It's bad enough being judged by you,
but being judged by Lee, in Asda!

15:25.200 --> 15:29.480
In an aisle that sells cheese
in a can!

15:29.480 --> 15:31.520
Well, I'm certainly not judging you,
Anna.

15:31.520 --> 15:35.600
In fact, I was wondering if
I could have your surgeon's number?

15:35.600 --> 15:37.400
I'm thinking of doing it.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.480
Oh. Well, what brought that on?

15:40.480 --> 15:42.800
I want to feel good about myself.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.160
And it's either that or
start tucking them into my socks.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.400
So, um, I was wondering
if you could tell me

15:48.400 --> 15:51.160
what you'd had done, exactly?

15:51.160 --> 15:52.520
Oh, nothing excessive.

15:52.520 --> 15:56.200
Just a tasteful augmentation
to lift and enhance,

15:56.200 --> 15:58.240
may have gone up a cup size, or two.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.040
Less Page 3, more Boden catalogue.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.400
It's OK, Lucy, you can ask me.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.600
Ask you what?

16:06.600 --> 16:07.840
If you can see them.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.320
What! I wasn't, I mean...

16:11.480 --> 16:14.000
Actually, can I♪ Of course.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.360
I'm happy to show you.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.880
Wow, is this real?

16:17.880 --> 16:21.560
Or am I making a cameo appearance
in one of Lee's dreams?

16:24.880 --> 16:30.920
As Lee would say, crikey, O'Reilly!
They are incredible, Anna.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.640
They're like works of art.

16:33.640 --> 16:34.960
Yes.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.040
That's why they stay
behind a velvet rope

16:37.040 --> 16:39.920
and an alarm goes off
if Toby tries to touch them.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.880
Crikey, O'Reilly!

16:58.960 --> 17:01.280
Hello♪ I'm back.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.319
Home at 9.36pm
and not a minute earlier.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.280
I thought Anna was here.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.640
She popped out.

17:09.640 --> 17:10.720
I saw.

17:12.280 --> 17:15.400
I mean, I can see.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.400
She had to pop home to get me
something.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.520
What♪ You're not going to like it.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.119
Try me. Every now
and again, Anna does something that

17:22.119 --> 17:23.760
I find surprisingly tolerable.

17:25.160 --> 17:27.359
She's gone home to get me
the details of her surgeon.

17:27.359 --> 17:30.280
She knows him well and reckons she
can get him to see me quite quickly.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.800
So, I'm sorry, Lee,
but I'm going through with it.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.640
Well, I've been thinking
about things,

17:35.640 --> 17:38.000
and I've decided to support you
in your wishes.

17:39.480 --> 17:40.800
What?

17:40.800 --> 17:43.920
You deserve to do something that
makes you feel good about yourself,

17:43.920 --> 17:46.440
and although I still don't think
you need a boob job,

17:46.440 --> 17:48.440
if you still want to go and see
the consultant,

17:48.440 --> 17:50.360
I want to come with you,
to be there for you.

17:50.360 --> 17:54.240
Oh, right, well, that's great.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.120
And you know I'm not being
influenced

17:56.120 --> 17:58.520
by Anna having had it done,
don't you♪ I know, me, neither.

17:58.520 --> 18:00.280
What♪ Nothing.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.160
She's been really good to talk to

18:06.160 --> 18:08.440
and she's made me feel
really comfortable about it,

18:08.440 --> 18:10.320
but I'm not doing it
because she has.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.760
I know. And I'm sorry I said that.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.120
Good.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.640
Although I still want
that Nespresso frother.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.880
Noted.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.680
Aw, thanks, Lee.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.080
Hey, you'll never guess
what she did?

18:24.080 --> 18:25.720
What?

18:27.080 --> 18:28.720
She showed me them.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.440
She actually undid her blouse
and bra and got them out.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.000
No!

18:37.840 --> 18:39.640
Honestly, Lee, they were...

18:39.640 --> 18:42.000
Impressive. Impressive?

18:43.080 --> 18:44.520
Impressive.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.120
If you'd have seen her body,
you would have thought she was 28.

18:47.120 --> 18:50.320
Oh, I'd have said more like 38DD.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.040
But you've seen them
and I haven't, so let's go with 28.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.480
Oh, I'm really pleased
you're coming with me.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.720
Who knows, you might even
think of some questions

18:58.720 --> 19:00.000
I hadn't even considered.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.760
And what about heat♪ Will they melt

19:01.760 --> 19:03.880
if she sits next to
a three-bar fire?

19:05.480 --> 19:08.280
No, they won't melt,
but they might freeze up in winter.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.440
That was just a joke.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.760
Like yours.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.040
Mine wasn't a joke.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.600
Right.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.800
And what about the, um, the cost?

19:18.800 --> 19:23.600
Lee. Myself and Dr Rhodes have
already discussed this on the phone.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.400
All the details of prices are here.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.520
Blimey.
Now I finally understand the phrase,

19:29.520 --> 19:31.600
"You don't get many of those
to the pound."

19:33.280 --> 19:34.520
Sorry, please carry on.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.960
Well, we've discussed on the phone
what you wanted to achieve, Lucy,

19:37.960 --> 19:41.080
so maybe now I can show you
some images.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.120
And we can discuss options.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.400
Wow.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.880
There are so many to choose from.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.160
Any thoughts, Lee?

19:50.160 --> 19:52.120
I mean, adult ones.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.000
Yeah, those are...fine.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.160
What about those?

19:58.160 --> 19:59.240
Yep.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.280
Those?

20:01.280 --> 20:02.760
Yep, sure.

20:04.320 --> 20:07.160
He was like this when we were
choosing samples in Allied Carpets.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.160
It's all right, you're allowed
to say which ones you like.

20:11.160 --> 20:12.920
OK, what about
the beige waterproof ones

20:12.920 --> 20:14.600
that don't show
the kids' Ribena stains?

20:15.720 --> 20:19.080
Sorry.
It just feels like a trap, you know,

20:19.080 --> 20:21.640
the kind of question
you shouldn't answer honestly.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.840
Like when you say,
"Are my fairy cakes dry?"

20:23.840 --> 20:25.840
Or, "Do you think
my mum's attractive?"

20:27.080 --> 20:28.520
I'm sorry, I didn't realise.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.880
And do you feel that way?

20:30.880 --> 20:32.960
Well,
she does sometimes look quite hot,

20:32.960 --> 20:35.640
especially in that little red dress.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.520
I meant the fairy cakes.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.600
Right.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.480
Come on, it's all right, Lee,
you can say which ones are nice,

20:41.480 --> 20:42.600
I won't be offended.

20:42.600 --> 20:48.800
All right, well,
those and those are...good.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.480
Those♪ Really?

20:54.800 --> 20:57.360
That's interesting. What is?

20:57.360 --> 21:01.200
Well, it's just that you've gone
for the bigger ones, that's all.

21:01.200 --> 21:05.400
Yes, some of those would be
quite a dramatic enhancement.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.280
Those patients already had
fairly large breasts.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.240
Fairly♪ I thought I was looking
at a pop-up book.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.120
All right. What about those?

21:14.120 --> 21:16.160
Those?

21:16.160 --> 21:18.480
They're massive!
I need to be able to see over them!

21:18.480 --> 21:20.680
They're more the sort of breasts
you'd want

21:20.680 --> 21:22.400
if you needed to cross the desert.

21:23.720 --> 21:27.040
All right, well, why don't you
tell me which ones you prefer?

21:27.040 --> 21:29.880
Well, I was thinking of
maybe something like this?

21:29.880 --> 21:36.320
Well, those are the same size
as the ones you have now.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.720
So?

21:37.720 --> 21:40.000
Well, I don't understand.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.840
What don't you understand?

21:41.840 --> 21:46.240
Well, why go through all this
and end up with the same size boobs?

21:46.240 --> 21:50.760
Surely the whole point is that
you want bigger ones, don't you?

21:50.760 --> 21:52.720
Who said I wanted big boobs?

21:52.720 --> 21:54.960
You did. Didn't you?

21:54.960 --> 21:57.440
No. I said I wanted a boob job.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.400
And does "boob" not mean
what I think it means?

22:00.400 --> 22:03.200
Is "boob" now a slang word for feet?
Are you getting bigger feet?

22:03.200 --> 22:06.880
Nothing is getting bigger.
Apart from the hole you're digging.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.320
I just wanted a bit of
lift and shaping, you know,

22:09.320 --> 22:11.680
perkier and up here.

22:11.680 --> 22:16.200
Location, location, location!
But definitely not bigger.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.920
Right.

22:17.920 --> 22:22.120
I was only joking, by the way, your
fairy cakes are really moist. Ha.

22:22.120 --> 22:25.160
Is that what you wanted, then,
me to end up with bigger boobs?

22:25.160 --> 22:26.560
Don't start making this about me.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.960
Well, it's hard not to make it
about you, when all the women

22:28.960 --> 22:32.160
you've picked out make Katie Price
look like an ironing board.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.360
I just thought you wanted
bigger boobs, OK?

22:34.360 --> 22:36.120
Why would you think that?

22:36.120 --> 22:39.000
I just assumed, especially the way
you were gawping at Anna's

22:39.000 --> 22:40.200
when she whipped hers out.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.520
When did you see me gawping at Anna?

22:45.520 --> 22:46.840
I didn't.

22:46.840 --> 22:49.560
Your description of the events
just made it come to life.

22:49.560 --> 22:50.800
You should write novels.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.760
Oh, I see.

22:54.760 --> 22:58.240
You were there, weren't you?
You saw them.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.960
All right, I came home early
and I saw Anna through the window,

23:00.960 --> 23:03.240
swinging her baps around
like the Hovis bread man.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.280
So why didn't you say anything?

23:06.280 --> 23:07.680
Well, what was I supposed to say?

23:07.680 --> 23:10.680
"Hi, Anna, nice boobs. I like the
way they follow you round the room."

23:10.680 --> 23:13.040
I mean,
why didn't you say anything to me?

23:13.040 --> 23:15.160
Because I was...embarrassed.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.640
Yeah, I bet you were.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.880
Oh, this is all making sense now.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.480
Before, you were all like,
"Don't do it, don't throw

23:21.480 --> 23:24.440
"the family savings at some
morally bankrupt Dr Frankenstein."

23:24.440 --> 23:25.920
She's paraphrasing.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.600
But then you saw Anna's
big old mamas and papas

23:29.600 --> 23:31.160
and everything changes.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.280
Not only do you suddenly
support my decision,

23:33.280 --> 23:35.640
you actually want me to get
a pair that look like

23:35.640 --> 23:36.960
Right Said Fred have reformed.

23:36.960 --> 23:39.800
That is not true! I'd already
chatted with Toby in the coffee shop

23:39.800 --> 23:42.440
and realised I needed
to support your wishes.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.400
You mean you realised you could
end up with a nice big pair.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.240
In fact, the perfect pair,

23:47.240 --> 23:50.200
the same as Anna's,
but without Anna attached!

23:50.200 --> 23:53.560
Perhaps you should go away
and give this some more thought.

23:53.560 --> 23:54.840
Fine!

23:55.880 --> 23:57.760
You're blowing this up
out of all proportion.

23:57.760 --> 24:00.080
Oh, I'm sorry, Lee, I thought
that's what you were after.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.320
Do we have to do shopping now♪ Can't
we go home and talk about this?

24:05.320 --> 24:07.680
The mood I'm in now, it's probably
better if we stay here,

24:07.680 --> 24:09.320
in public,
where there are witnesses.

24:09.320 --> 24:12.120
I don't understand why you're so
upset. It's your hypocrisy, Lee!

24:12.120 --> 24:14.600
I wouldn't have minded
if you'd been honest from the start,

24:14.600 --> 24:17.000
but you had to pretend to be
all noble and new man about it!

24:17.000 --> 24:18.960
Really make me
feel bad for even considering it,

24:18.960 --> 24:21.440
but it turns out I'm married
to Benny Hill! I'm the one that

24:21.440 --> 24:23.840
didn't even want you to have
a boob job in the first place.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.000
Exactly! Right up
until you saw Anna's whoppers,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.840
then you soon put in an order
for an extra large Happy Meal!

24:28.840 --> 24:31.640
Whoppers are Burger King,
McDonald's are Happy Meals.

24:31.640 --> 24:35.320
Look, I swear, seeing Anna
did not make me change my mind

24:35.320 --> 24:36.840
about supporting you.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.920
I'd already decided that
in the coffee shop with Toby.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.880
Liar!

24:41.880 --> 24:44.600
Typical man. All I wanted was
a tiny, tasteful breast lift

24:44.600 --> 24:47.400
to feel good about myself,
but it turns out you wanted me

24:47.400 --> 24:50.200
to end up looking like I'm breast
feeding the Mitchell brothers!

24:50.200 --> 24:51.240
You know that was eggs.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.240
And to think you had the audacity
to take the moral high ground,

24:54.240 --> 24:55.960
really making me feel bad!

24:55.960 --> 24:58.520
Oh! Lucy, come back!

24:59.920 --> 25:01.440
Oh, for...

25:02.560 --> 25:04.840
Is this what you wanted?

25:04.840 --> 25:07.480
Oh, dear, look at me
with my big old boobies,

25:07.480 --> 25:10.160
they're causing a commotion!

25:10.160 --> 25:12.280
For God's sake, Lucy! Oh, hello.

25:12.280 --> 25:17.040
You must excuse me, they're just so
big and bouncy and out of control.

25:18.480 --> 25:21.440
You're being ridiculous!
Am I♪ Isn't this what you wanted?

25:21.440 --> 25:23.240
No, I thought it was what you
wanted!

25:23.240 --> 25:25.760
Oh, come off it, Lee,
you're a bloke, you love big boobs.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.880
You'd love it
if I went back to that surgeon

25:27.880 --> 25:32.080
and asked for double helpings
of Anna's humongous devil fun bags!

25:32.080 --> 25:33.880
Will you keep your voice down! Why?

25:33.880 --> 25:35.760
Are the big boobies
embarrassing you?

25:35.760 --> 25:38.200
Look at me, everyone,
look at my boobs, I'm Anna.

25:38.200 --> 25:44.400
Look at my big, fake, ridiculous,
stupid, bobbly Tupperware knockers!

25:53.760 --> 25:55.760
You know, Anna,
I really think it's time

25:55.760 --> 25:58.400
we considered
ordering our groceries online.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.360
I got you this.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.760
How are you feeling♪ Mortified.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.360
Embarrassed.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.960
Like a massive tit.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.320
At least there's one silver lining.

26:22.320 --> 26:25.480
Toby told you the truth about
the fact that I'd already decided

26:25.480 --> 26:27.520
to support you. Because I love you.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.080
Not because I saw Anna's boobs.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.120
I'm sorry, Lee.
I shouldn't have doubted you.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.560
I'm going to call round to Anna's
tomorrow to apologise.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.040
Don't worry, Anna's got thick skin.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.800
I bet that surgeon had
to use a pneumatic drill.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.800
Oh, bit late for coffee, isn't it?

26:44.800 --> 26:48.960
Well, I thought you'd want to try
out our new Nespresso frother.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.240
It arrived this afternoon.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.880
Aw, thanks.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.520
And just to be absolutely clear,

26:53.520 --> 26:55.600
it's exactly
the same as Anna's milk frother,

26:55.600 --> 26:57.520
but I'm not saying
there's anything wrong

26:57.520 --> 27:00.160
with the old milk whisk
you've got in the kitchen drawer.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.520
I have been behaving
a bit irrationally, haven't I?

27:03.520 --> 27:04.720
Like that consultant said,

27:04.720 --> 27:07.040
I need to give the whole thing
a lot more thought.

27:07.040 --> 27:10.760
So I've decided, for now,
no breast augmentation.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.240
So your boobs are on hold.

27:12.240 --> 27:14.320
If that's you trying it on,
let me finish my coffee.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.280
I'm glad you're not going
through with it. You're perfect.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.720
Aw, thanks.

27:19.720 --> 27:22.000
I love you, you psycho.

27:24.480 --> 27:27.400
Hey, and maybe I won't get
that penis enlargement.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.400
Good. You paused again!

27:34.840 --> 27:36.600
# We're not going out

27:36.600 --> 27:38.200
# Not staying in

27:38.200 --> 27:41.520
# Just hanging around
with my head in a spin

27:41.520 --> 27:44.040
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

27:44.040 --> 27:47.520
# We're not going out
