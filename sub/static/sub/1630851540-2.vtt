WEBVTT

00:08.416 --> 00:09.916
Mom, please.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Let's not bite the hand that feeds us.
There's a lot of money to be made.

00:14.041 --> 00:16.833
No, we can't take them. It's too risky.

00:18.958 --> 00:21.416
Mom, that doctor is the best.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.375
Everyone calls him
the Bavarian watchmaker.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.958
A name like that isn't a coincidence.

00:28.041 --> 00:29.833
He took care of the Bogdanoffs himself.

00:29.916 --> 00:32.500
Did you see the face he gave them,
with that chin?

00:32.583 --> 00:35.083
He turned those fags into men in a snap.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.375
You can't say that wasn't good work.

00:38.208 --> 00:40.000
They belong to Guzman, not us.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.916
And the old guy is weak.

00:43.375 --> 00:46.208
If he dies on us
and we can't give him back to the cartel,

00:46.291 --> 00:47.291
we're in deep shit.

00:47.375 --> 00:50.291
Mom, I feel like
you're not listening. Look.

00:50.375 --> 00:51.750
We're gonna take them,

00:51.833 --> 00:54.125
open them up carefully,

00:54.208 --> 00:56.750
take one kidney each, close them back up,

00:56.833 --> 00:59.500
give them back to Guzman,
and get our money.

01:00.083 --> 01:03.125
No one sees or hears a thing.
Easy as pie. I swear.

01:04.541 --> 01:07.166
Trust me for once, Mom. Please.

01:08.291 --> 01:09.166
For once.

01:10.125 --> 01:11.166
I'll think about it.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.500
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:24.208 --> 01:27.125
So this is about 350 grams
of Joseph's liver.

01:27.208 --> 01:28.625
-Is that good?
-Very good.

01:28.708 --> 01:29.666
Anything else?

01:29.750 --> 01:31.750
Do you have some heart?

01:33.333 --> 01:34.375
Some heart…

01:34.458 --> 01:35.500
Yes.

01:35.583 --> 01:37.375
I have one, but it's Gérard's.

01:37.458 --> 01:39.125
Is it good?

01:39.208 --> 01:41.500
It's not the same quality,
but it's a lot cheaper.

01:41.583 --> 01:44.666
But you can't let it sit. You have
to eat it fast or it'll go to the garbage.

01:44.750 --> 01:46.291
Perfect. It's for tonight.

01:46.375 --> 01:47.458
Sold.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.833
And Gérard's lungs are on the house.

01:50.416 --> 01:53.041
They're all black,
but if you have a dog, he'll love them.

01:53.125 --> 01:54.833
That's nice of you. Thanks.

01:56.708 --> 01:57.625
Anything else?

01:58.208 --> 01:59.291
Dad?

01:59.875 --> 02:00.916
Dad?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.083
Hey, Dad? Earth to Dad.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.750
Yeah… What? I'm here.

02:06.291 --> 02:08.250
-Sorry.
-Great. What do you think?

02:09.625 --> 02:10.458
About?

02:11.166 --> 02:13.041
Go on, Aure. Explain it again.

02:13.125 --> 02:15.708
We buried five million euros
in the forest.

02:15.791 --> 02:17.750
I think that's enough
to pay for everything.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.041
Are you guys crazy?

02:19.125 --> 02:21.125
If we try and buy our organs from him,

02:21.208 --> 02:23.666
he'll take our money
and our organs anyway.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.333
Olivier's right.

02:25.416 --> 02:27.375
We'll die poor and that's it.

02:27.458 --> 02:30.291
Quit saying that.
No one's gonna die, okay?

02:30.375 --> 02:33.291
"Herz" wasn't in the notebook.
They're not gonna take our hearts.

02:33.375 --> 02:36.458
No, Aure,
I don't care if "Herz" was written or not.

02:36.541 --> 02:39.083
I don't wanna live the rest of my life
with one lung, one kidney,

02:39.166 --> 02:40.875
and half a liver, okay?

02:40.958 --> 02:42.458
We need to leave. I already told you.

02:42.541 --> 02:44.916
-Yeah…
-Then we have to go this way.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.541
There's smoke.
Probably someone who could help.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.875
Or at least a phone.

02:48.958 --> 02:51.208
We saw that house. It's too far away.

02:51.291 --> 02:54.875
In any case, we won't last five minutes
in that South American wilderness.

02:55.625 --> 02:58.291
What makes you think
we're in South America?

02:58.375 --> 03:01.458
Just 'cause this is written in Spanish
doesn't mean we're in South America.

03:01.541 --> 03:02.458
Yeah, I know.

03:02.541 --> 03:05.083
I think so because it's really humid

03:05.166 --> 03:07.666
and my joints are killing me.

03:07.750 --> 03:08.625
That's why.

03:08.708 --> 03:10.458
In Gérard's defense,

03:10.541 --> 03:14.166
I must admit I heard
pink-throat toucans singing several times.

03:14.750 --> 03:17.250
And since it's migrating season,

03:17.333 --> 03:19.791
it makes sense they'd be
in South America at this time.

03:19.875 --> 03:21.500
What are you talking about?

03:21.583 --> 03:23.333
-What is he talking about?
-What?

03:23.416 --> 03:26.250
You went hunting twice
and now you're a bird expert.

03:26.333 --> 03:27.416
That's crazy.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.583
No, that's not it.

03:28.666 --> 03:32.000
It's just the pink-throat toucan
is basic in ornithology.

03:32.083 --> 03:33.500
We don't care about toucans.

03:33.583 --> 03:35.750
-Yeah, we don't, bro.
-Yeah.

03:35.833 --> 03:38.208
Who cares where we are?
There are men with guns outside.

03:38.291 --> 03:39.458
How do we get out of here?

03:40.333 --> 03:42.708
That's true. She's right. We can't…

03:42.791 --> 03:44.208
We can't just up and leave.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.500
We need to buy some time
to come up with a plan.

03:48.833 --> 03:50.208
And how do we buy time?

03:56.041 --> 03:57.250
Okay, I got it.

03:57.333 --> 03:58.250
I know.

03:59.833 --> 04:01.125
We need to get sick.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.083
-What do you mean?
-Yeah.

04:03.833 --> 04:06.458
They want our organs.
If we get sick, they can't take them.

04:06.541 --> 04:07.833
They'll be infected.

04:07.916 --> 04:09.666
Damn, that's genius. Sorry--

04:09.750 --> 04:11.875
-Thank you. I thought you'd say that.
-Yeah.

04:11.958 --> 04:12.958
Okay, great.

04:13.875 --> 04:16.208
But how do we get sick?

04:20.208 --> 04:21.791
Dirty bastard! You had it!

04:21.875 --> 04:23.875
I knew it. I lent it to you ten years ago.

04:23.958 --> 04:25.375
-Youss?
-What?

04:25.458 --> 04:27.250
Are you sure no one followed us?

04:27.333 --> 04:29.333
Come have a seat. Stop freaking out.

04:30.416 --> 04:33.041
It's normal you'd be paranoid
after what you went through.

04:33.125 --> 04:35.291
Don't worry, bro. No one followed us.

04:35.916 --> 04:38.375
And a weapon? Did you bring me one?

04:39.375 --> 04:42.083
If someone shows up,
I need to be able to defend myself.

04:49.958 --> 04:51.125
I'm putting it here.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.458
But be careful.
Only use it in a real emergency, okay?

04:54.541 --> 04:56.250
-Yeah.
-Don't mess around with it.

04:57.041 --> 04:59.500
Freeze, you sons of bitches,
or I'll kill you!

05:00.750 --> 05:02.041
Just kidding.

05:02.125 --> 05:03.541
-How are you, Ali?
-Okay.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.250
-Did you shit your pants?
-What?

05:05.333 --> 05:07.916
Well, those guys are real thugs.
You gotta be tough!

05:08.000 --> 05:11.250
Stop it! Can't you see he's not okay?
Don't listen to her.

05:12.333 --> 05:13.708
Anyway, I thought about it.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.875
Call your friends
to find Pénélope Cavillan.

05:15.958 --> 05:18.583
-That's how we're gonna find the Hazans.
-What friends?

05:18.666 --> 05:20.250
Your little friends from jail.

05:21.291 --> 05:23.458
I don't have any friends from jail.
I'm a chocolatier.

05:23.541 --> 05:25.416
People can't understand that.
It's unbelievable.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.458
You can't fool me
with your worker-of-the-year act.

05:28.541 --> 05:31.291
No, I'm serious.
I cut ties with that world, okay?

05:31.375 --> 05:33.041
I'm not getting back into that.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.666
Okay, fine.

05:37.000 --> 05:37.958
I hope you know

05:38.041 --> 05:41.416
that if Joseph doesn't come back,
William will be your brother-in-law.

05:41.916 --> 05:45.041
So don't come crying to me
like a big baby after.

05:46.333 --> 05:48.875
It's my sister's choice.
What do you want me to do?

05:48.958 --> 05:50.416
Okay. Very well.

05:52.125 --> 05:55.125
But the last time
I heard William talking about you,

05:56.208 --> 05:57.791
he said…

05:57.875 --> 06:01.250
I don't know what this means,
but he said you were a raghead.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.000
A real raghead is what he said.

06:03.083 --> 06:04.750
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:04.833 --> 06:08.291
He said you were a piece of shit.
He said, "Yeah, he's a piece of shit."

06:08.375 --> 06:09.458
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

06:09.541 --> 06:12.000
And then he said, "Yeah…"

06:13.333 --> 06:15.166
And then he stopped talking about you.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.500
But all right, go ahead.

06:18.083 --> 06:20.750
Keep making your little éclairs
and your fougasse,

06:21.708 --> 06:23.750
but I assure you
Gordon Ramsay won't help you

06:23.833 --> 06:25.708
because your hell
isn't gonna be in the kitchen.

06:25.791 --> 06:27.750
Your hell is William.

06:28.333 --> 06:29.833
You know what? Thanks, Clém.

06:29.916 --> 06:32.333
I'm gonna make a few calls.
That asshole will see.

06:32.416 --> 06:33.708
I'll show him who's a raghead.

06:33.791 --> 06:35.458
There you go. We love that!

06:35.541 --> 06:37.875
Now I see your balls full of jizz.

06:37.958 --> 06:40.625
Easy on my balls.
But don't tell my sister.

06:40.708 --> 06:42.333
Otherwise, I swear she'll kill me.

06:42.416 --> 06:45.166
-Over your big balls?
-No! Not that.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.916
About the calls I'm gonna make.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.375
Right. Don't worry.
That doesn't happen in my house.

06:49.458 --> 06:50.750
It stays between us.

06:57.041 --> 07:00.125
Dad, just get a little.
You have less than I do.

07:01.625 --> 07:02.875
Are you sure about this?

07:02.958 --> 07:04.833
Yeah, it's full of bacteria. It'll work.

07:04.916 --> 07:06.708
But don't think about it.

07:06.791 --> 07:09.083
-To your health.
-Yeah, to "health."

07:09.166 --> 07:10.708
You gotta say it quick.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.208
-Dad?
-What?

07:14.291 --> 07:16.958
I wanted to apologize
for the other night. Really.

07:17.041 --> 07:19.708
Yeah, I badmouthed Catherine.

07:19.791 --> 07:22.166
No, it's my fault too.

07:23.708 --> 07:25.750
I get offended easily about that.
Haven't you noticed?

07:25.833 --> 07:28.375
-Yeah, but I get it.
-I'm worried.

07:28.458 --> 07:30.750
I'm scared she won't manage without me.

07:30.833 --> 07:33.375
No, don't worry. I think…

07:33.458 --> 07:35.916
I think, financially, before she met you,

07:36.416 --> 07:38.416
she must've always managed.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.041
What do you mean?

07:40.125 --> 07:41.625
With money.

07:41.708 --> 07:43.708
I think she'll manage.

07:43.791 --> 07:45.791
Why are you talking about money?

07:45.875 --> 07:47.875
That's-- Hold on.

07:47.958 --> 07:50.916
-Isn't that what you meant?
-What are you saying?

07:51.000 --> 07:51.833
Nothing.

07:51.916 --> 07:53.500
You're saying I'm a creepy old man

07:53.583 --> 07:55.666
and if a woman loves me,
it's for my money, aren't you?

07:55.750 --> 07:57.375
-Not at all. I swear.
-Yes.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.083
That didn't come out right.

07:59.166 --> 08:01.791
-I misunderstood.
-It's okay. That's enough.

08:02.791 --> 08:04.000
Dad, seriously…

08:04.083 --> 08:05.250
Fuck.

08:06.291 --> 08:08.333
Good job, Jo. Real smooth.

08:08.416 --> 08:09.458
Come on.

08:09.541 --> 08:12.208
You're the one who said
Catherine was a bombshell.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.916
I'm sorry, but I think that's weird.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.875
Yeah, I said she was beautiful.

08:15.958 --> 08:17.666
But I didn't say she was a hooker.

08:18.333 --> 08:19.333
A hooker…

08:21.916 --> 08:23.333
For fuck's sake…

08:24.916 --> 08:26.375
-That tastes like piss.
-Whatever.

08:26.458 --> 08:28.041
Seriously? Fuck.

08:30.208 --> 08:31.500
He'll calm down. I know him.

08:31.583 --> 08:33.458
I'm gonna apologize and he'll calm down.

08:34.291 --> 08:36.708
If anyone should be worried
about family, it's me.

08:39.208 --> 08:41.458
I don't know
how Aïda's gonna handle the triplets.

08:42.708 --> 08:44.750
Don't worry. Aïda will manage.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.833
No, you don't manage
when you're alone with three kids.

08:50.583 --> 08:51.708
Poor Aïda.

08:57.458 --> 08:58.375
Listen, Jo.

08:59.541 --> 09:03.375
I didn't want to mention it,
but I can tell you're really worried.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.750
Aïda's not alone, you know.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.208
What?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.375
She's not alone.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.041
She has a…

09:14.041 --> 09:14.916
Yes.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.416
She met someone.

09:23.125 --> 09:24.666
Who is this son of a bitch?

09:24.750 --> 09:26.625
I don't know. I don't know him.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.541
She seems to say he's really nice,

09:29.625 --> 09:31.958
and most importantly,
the triplets adore him.

09:32.041 --> 09:33.750
All right. What's with you?

09:34.416 --> 09:35.500
Does he have a name?

09:35.583 --> 09:38.416
Yes, of course. His name's William.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.208
-William?
-Yeah.

09:40.291 --> 09:41.291
You know him?

09:41.375 --> 09:43.458
I can't believe she's dating him.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.500
Her fucking colleague.
That son of a bitch.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.291
I know exactly who that is,
an asshole with a fucking goatee.

09:52.375 --> 09:53.291
Yeah.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.833
-A piece of shit. An asshole.
-Yeah.

09:54.916 --> 09:58.583
Every time I saw him, he'd show off
with his little glasses, like he's Obama.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.625
Obama doesn't wear glasses.

10:00.708 --> 10:02.708
-Yes, he does!
-Yeah.

10:02.791 --> 10:05.208
-Obama wears glasses.
-Yeah.

10:06.416 --> 10:09.041
Listen.
You have to look at the bright side.

10:09.125 --> 10:12.208
Obviously, it's really hard, but

10:12.833 --> 10:15.125
at least you know
she's not alone with the kids.

10:15.208 --> 10:16.458
I don't give a shit.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.625
I'm the boss of my family.

10:19.166 --> 10:20.375
-Yeah.
-Not William.

10:20.458 --> 10:23.583
Of course, Jo. No one's gonna take
your place. That's not what I'm saying.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.875
Hey, guys. I found some mushrooms.

10:26.958 --> 10:29.541
-This is great for getting sick.
-Let's see.

10:30.625 --> 10:32.333
What are you doing? Are you insane?

10:32.416 --> 10:35.125
-Do you want to die?
-I'm warning you, I won't touch those.

10:35.208 --> 10:37.375
I have delicate intestines. I'm gassy.

10:37.458 --> 10:39.541
Forget it, Dad. I have another plan.

10:39.625 --> 10:41.583
I saw one of the guards has an iPhone.

10:41.666 --> 10:44.333
I'll get him, high kick, bam,
Face ID, Google Maps.

10:44.416 --> 10:46.041
We call the police and get out of here.

10:46.666 --> 10:48.375
She's thinks she's Conor McGregor.

10:48.458 --> 10:50.875
Listen. I did some MMA with Élo. Okay?

10:50.958 --> 10:52.916
-I'm a machine.
-A machine…

10:53.666 --> 10:54.708
A washing machine, yeah.

10:54.791 --> 10:56.708
Yeah, a dishwasher.

10:56.791 --> 10:58.666
Yeah? You don't believe me?

10:59.833 --> 11:01.541
Dad, come here. Try to punch me.

11:02.250 --> 11:03.125
Honey--

11:03.208 --> 11:06.500
No, not Dad.
The guards aren't 70-year-old camels.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.083
You're right. Okay.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.250
-Come on, Olive. Move.
-Easy.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.958
Come on, try to hit me.

11:12.041 --> 11:14.916
Go on, honey. Hit him hard
for that camel comment.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.791
No, I'm not gonna hit you.
You're my sister.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.541
-Come on. Try!
-Stop it. Don't be stupid.

11:19.625 --> 11:20.500
-Jo.
-Stop.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.291
-Smack me.
-No!

11:22.375 --> 11:24.375
Imagine I'm Aïda's boyfriend, okay?

11:25.166 --> 11:26.375
Come on.

11:26.458 --> 11:28.583
-Don't go there.
-Come on, you piece of shit.

11:28.666 --> 11:30.833
-Don't go there.
-Are you getting into it now?

11:30.916 --> 11:32.208
Come on. Smack me.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.250
Come on, damn it.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.500
Imagine I'm fucking her hard
in front of the triplets.

11:36.583 --> 11:39.375
I take her and bang her like a drum,
the dirty bitch!

11:40.291 --> 11:42.500
So you're gonna bang her
like a drum, asshole?

11:42.583 --> 11:45.500
-Aure, are you okay? Fuck!
-Damn, what a punch!

11:46.583 --> 11:48.833
I swear, I thought she was gonna dodge.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.375
You didn't have to hit her like an idiot.

11:51.458 --> 11:52.958
You knocked her out.

11:53.041 --> 11:55.416
Sorry, but she said, "Come on. Hit me."

11:55.500 --> 11:57.916
-She got me going with her MMA talk.
-You're an idiot.

11:58.833 --> 11:59.666
Anyway…

11:59.750 --> 12:02.208
And you too, Olive.
You could've held him back.

12:03.208 --> 12:04.041
What?

12:04.125 --> 12:05.833
Nothing. Damn.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.250
I'm sorry. I can't focus.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.958
I'm thinking about
what the doctor said about my father.

12:12.041 --> 12:16.041
Gérard, you've always been told
my father died of fibromyalgia, right?

12:16.125 --> 12:18.083
That's what your mother
told me back in the day.

12:18.166 --> 12:20.083
Are you sure? That was all she said?

12:20.833 --> 12:22.375
What do you want her to have said?

12:22.458 --> 12:25.291
His name was Laurent Pariente.
He was a businessman.

12:26.041 --> 12:27.708
Totally normal. Nothing crazy.

12:27.791 --> 12:30.833
I'm a grown-up now, damn it.
If he was in the business, tell me.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.500
What business, Olive? Textiles?

12:33.583 --> 12:35.875
No, the business. Organized crime.

12:36.583 --> 12:40.000
If he died in a robbery or something,
I have the right to know. That's all.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.416
You're imagining things.

12:42.416 --> 12:43.625
You're making stuff up.

12:43.708 --> 12:45.875
Making stuff up? That's funny.

12:54.833 --> 12:55.791
What is this?

12:57.750 --> 12:59.750
Damn, it's huge.

13:00.541 --> 13:01.375
No!

13:06.041 --> 13:07.041
No.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.458
-Olive?
-What are you doing there?

13:13.541 --> 13:16.291
-Damn, Olive. The mushrooms are hardcore.
-What? Oh, that?

13:16.375 --> 13:19.333
No, I've had this shit for six months,
but it's not contagious anymore.

13:19.416 --> 13:22.458
I'm not talking about your balls.
I'm talking about the shrooms we ate.

13:22.541 --> 13:24.000
It's weirding me out.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.500
What do you mean? Are you tripping?

13:26.583 --> 13:27.666
-No!
-I swear.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.208
-Fuck.
-Help me.

13:29.291 --> 13:31.041
-What are you doing there?
-Your hands.

13:31.125 --> 13:32.000
Come here.

13:39.208 --> 13:40.250
Whoa!

13:40.333 --> 13:41.916
Whoa! Damn!

13:42.541 --> 13:44.083
Bro, what's this?

13:44.791 --> 13:47.208
Damn, you're buff as hell. Yeah.

13:47.291 --> 13:48.458
What an insane cuerpo.

13:50.041 --> 13:52.166
I don't know.
I've been doing some push-ups.

13:52.250 --> 13:54.750
Fuck! Even your dick is buff as hell.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.458
What is that piece of meat?

13:56.541 --> 13:58.041
That fatty's touching the floor.

13:59.625 --> 14:02.208
Holy cow, it's like a water slide.

14:02.958 --> 14:05.541
Don't kick it.
You're gonna scratch the head.

14:05.625 --> 14:07.541
Hold on. You're right. It's kicking in.

14:08.375 --> 14:09.666
It's looking at me.

14:11.166 --> 14:12.166
It's looking at me.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.833
Fuck, I feel it in my cabeza.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.666
You too?

14:16.750 --> 14:18.333
-Yeah, I feel weird.
-Crazy, right?

14:18.833 --> 14:19.791
That's crazy.

14:19.875 --> 14:22.291
-You're right, damn it.
-Can I touch it?

14:22.375 --> 14:24.250
Yeah, touch it, but…

14:24.333 --> 14:26.041
Holy cow, the weight…

14:27.958 --> 14:29.250
I don't feel good.

14:29.916 --> 14:31.375
It's like a didgeridoo.

14:33.416 --> 14:34.958
Are you sure, Little Straw?

14:35.041 --> 14:37.375
He's worked with the Cavillans?

14:37.958 --> 14:39.250
Yeah, that's it, Pénélope.

14:39.333 --> 14:41.291
Yeah, her. He's worked with her?

14:41.791 --> 14:43.791
Are you sure that's his name?

14:44.666 --> 14:46.208
With a K at the end?

14:46.291 --> 14:47.875
All right, bro. You're awesome.

14:47.958 --> 14:50.208
You know what?
I'll come see you soon, okay?

14:50.291 --> 14:51.583
All right, I'll call you back.

14:52.916 --> 14:54.041
So let me explain.

14:54.666 --> 14:56.416
He gave us a name, but

14:57.208 --> 14:59.958
the name sounds old, I swear.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.541
Little Straw is on medication.

15:01.625 --> 15:03.875
Unbelievable.
I don't care about Little Straw.

15:03.958 --> 15:05.166
What's the name?

15:05.250 --> 15:06.958
He said Luka Finanouk.

15:07.666 --> 15:08.666
Perfect.

15:09.250 --> 15:10.083
We got him.

15:10.791 --> 15:12.750
I have a surefire way to find people.

15:12.833 --> 15:13.791
No way.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.083
Welcome to 411.

15:19.166 --> 15:20.541
Are you serious?

15:22.041 --> 15:23.083
City?

15:24.208 --> 15:25.041
Paris.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.208
You said Trouville.

15:27.291 --> 15:29.041
No, I didn't. I said Paris.

15:29.583 --> 15:30.625
Paris.

15:30.708 --> 15:32.708
-Parigi.
-Hello? Can I help you?

15:32.791 --> 15:35.125
Yes, ma'am, it's not Trouville.
It's Paris.

15:35.208 --> 15:37.375
You're connected for Trouville.
You have to start over.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.833
-I have to start all over again?
-Yes, unfortunately.

15:39.916 --> 15:42.458
Well, let's try Trouville then.
What can I say?

15:42.541 --> 15:43.875
Spell the name.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.750
Finanouk, just like it sounds,

15:45.833 --> 15:47.708
with an F as in Farhid.

15:47.791 --> 15:50.500
Like it sounds,
with a K at the end, like Catherik.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.500
What an idiot.

15:52.541 --> 15:54.958
I think I found something…

15:56.791 --> 15:57.708
Me too.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.208
Brace yourself.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.041
In Trouville,

16:03.916 --> 16:05.125
there are no Finanouks.

16:05.208 --> 16:08.625
Come on. Enough with Trouville
and all that. We don't have time.

16:09.208 --> 16:12.750
The only Luka Finanouk I found online
is a financial adviser.

16:13.541 --> 16:16.000
I told you.
Little Straw isn't feeling well.

16:16.083 --> 16:17.333
He gave me his banker's name.

16:17.416 --> 16:19.625
That's really nice.

16:19.708 --> 16:23.166
What do you mean? That's not at all
the kind of guy we're looking for.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.333
He even volunteers at a dog shelter.

16:25.416 --> 16:28.291
At the moment, that's all we have,
so it's worth digging into.

16:29.125 --> 16:31.750
We're gonna tail him and plant a bug.

16:33.625 --> 16:34.750
A bug?

16:34.833 --> 16:36.500
Whatever.

16:41.958 --> 16:43.208
What are we doing here?

16:43.791 --> 16:45.958
-Weren't we in the shower?
-I don't get it.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.000
Did we go through this wall or what?

16:57.958 --> 17:00.416
We can't go through walls, Olive.

17:01.708 --> 17:03.083
Damn it, Olive.

17:03.666 --> 17:04.833
It's the shrooms.

17:05.916 --> 17:07.166
It's a hallucinogen.

17:07.833 --> 17:08.791
No!

17:09.375 --> 17:12.750
-Does that mean we're still in the shower?
-Fuck, that's shit!

17:13.750 --> 17:17.333
Awesome! There's a computer.

17:17.416 --> 17:20.875
We can send a message
to the police so they can find us.

17:21.666 --> 17:22.916
This'll make Aure happy.

17:29.958 --> 17:31.416
-What?
-There are some clothes.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.416
Take them!

17:34.791 --> 17:36.541
Shit!

17:36.625 --> 17:37.458
What?

17:37.541 --> 17:40.125
The guards! I heard them. We have to go.

17:40.208 --> 17:42.000
We have to find a safe place.

17:42.083 --> 17:43.625
Come on. Let's go to plan B.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.083
What's plan B?

17:46.791 --> 17:47.791
That's not working.

17:47.875 --> 17:49.083
Forget it.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.875
Don't…

17:50.958 --> 17:53.125
Fine, no more plans.

17:54.291 --> 17:55.625
We're gonna get out of this.

18:00.625 --> 18:02.291
That's good. Let's go.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.333
That's it.

18:08.125 --> 18:09.541
We're gonna go online

18:09.625 --> 18:11.666
and call for help right away.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.000
No! Olive!

18:15.083 --> 18:16.500
-What's wrong?
-It's not plugged in!

18:16.583 --> 18:18.666
No! It's not plugged in!
Plug it in, Olive!

18:18.750 --> 18:20.916
There's an outlet
right here in front of you.

18:26.833 --> 18:29.125
It's asking for a password. Oh no!

18:29.208 --> 18:30.708
Don't panic.

18:30.791 --> 18:33.458
-You can figure out the password.
-Think!

18:33.541 --> 18:35.458
There's just a firewall trying to stop me.

18:35.541 --> 18:37.041
Let's see. Both of us.

18:37.125 --> 18:38.791
Show me what you've got.

18:55.666 --> 18:57.416
What do you think

18:58.583 --> 18:59.458
of this?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Olive.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.208
I got into the system.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.208
Oh my God.

19:09.708 --> 19:11.875
Fuck, they're coming.
Let's get out of here.

19:11.958 --> 19:14.250
We gotta go. Take that jump rope there.

19:14.333 --> 19:17.125
-Take the plancha too. We'll make a snack.
-Okay.

19:17.208 --> 19:18.833
-Fuck, you didn't take it.
-No.

19:20.666 --> 19:23.000
We don't know where they are.

19:23.083 --> 19:25.541
I went to the showers with them.

19:25.625 --> 19:28.291
And then I don't know where they went.

19:29.458 --> 19:31.500
-You're lying.
-No.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.000
You think I'm a fool.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.541
I'll put you on all fours
and break your teeth with an ice pick.

19:42.625 --> 19:44.416
You'll beg me to stop.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.458
Answer my question. It's easy.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.083
Where are they?

19:48.791 --> 19:50.500
We don't know
where they are, okay? Really.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.791
-You're lying too.
-We don't know where they are.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.791
Fuck! Please!

19:57.875 --> 19:58.916
Stop it.

19:59.541 --> 20:01.250
Stop it. I beg of you.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.833
-You have something to say?
-Yes.

20:02.916 --> 20:04.041
Okay, my son, Joseph…

20:04.125 --> 20:06.083
SANTA MARIA DE CARMEN MONASTERY
SAMIENTO, COLOMBIA

20:06.166 --> 20:09.708
One day, he said if we were
to get out and find help,

20:09.791 --> 20:11.875
we'd head to the sea.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.500
-To the sea?
-Yes, he wanted to go swimming.

20:15.583 --> 20:16.625
Swimming.

20:17.291 --> 20:18.416
Good, we're making progress.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.875
-Well, yes.
-Send some guys to the coast.

20:44.125 --> 20:47.666
I'm an ass
and you're an all-knowing visionary.

20:47.750 --> 20:50.166
-What are you saying?
-Gérard lied to you.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.291
I know him. I know when he's lying.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.083
What do you want me to do?

20:54.166 --> 20:56.541
You want me to go shoot him so he talks?

20:56.625 --> 20:58.625
Calm down. Let me think.

21:00.666 --> 21:02.916
I'll find another way to get the info.

21:07.708 --> 21:10.791
-I have the address of the monastery.
-What?

21:10.875 --> 21:13.708
-I have the address of the monastery.
-No way.

21:13.791 --> 21:16.000
Monasterio Santa María del Carmen,

21:16.083 --> 21:17.500
Samiento, Colombia.

21:17.583 --> 21:19.041
-I saw it in the chapel.
-Damn.

21:19.125 --> 21:21.500
I was sure we were in South America.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.708
I can finally put my plan into action.

21:25.916 --> 21:27.458
I'm gonna get us out of here.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.500
What's that shit?

21:29.583 --> 21:31.625
This is a bottle for the sea.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.333
I'm gonna put a message inside.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.708
Are you kidding?

21:35.791 --> 21:39.083
The last message in a bottle
took 129 years to arrive.

21:39.166 --> 21:41.333
-I saw it on the news.
-I know.

21:41.416 --> 21:43.208
That's why I'm making a little boat.

21:43.291 --> 21:45.791
I'll put the bottle on it
and it'll go ten times faster.

21:46.416 --> 21:47.750
-Okay.
-Yeah.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.708
I didn't get it. Cool. Then we're saved.

21:50.791 --> 21:52.875
-Yes.
-In 13 years.

21:52.958 --> 21:55.916
Well, Miss Know-it-all,
do you have a better idea?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.708
I told you earlier.

21:57.791 --> 21:59.791
We set the cell on fire, the guards come,

21:59.875 --> 22:00.875
I kick one of their asses,

22:00.958 --> 22:03.375
Face ID, monasterio,
emergency services, and we leave.

22:04.750 --> 22:05.625
Yeah.

22:06.208 --> 22:09.458
Honey, you know I love you.
I don't want to offend you,

22:09.541 --> 22:12.500
but given the blow you took earlier,

22:13.666 --> 22:16.833
I'm still gonna work on my little boat.

22:17.791 --> 22:18.625
Just in case.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.541
No problem.

22:38.791 --> 22:39.708
Fuck.

22:40.541 --> 22:41.833
We really got out of that one.

22:42.916 --> 22:44.583
Without even a scratch.

22:45.416 --> 22:47.625
Your camouflage looks so good.

22:48.416 --> 22:49.291
Really?

22:49.791 --> 22:51.250
I want some of that paint.

22:51.333 --> 22:52.250
Thanks.

23:08.083 --> 23:08.958
Fuck.

23:12.416 --> 23:13.666
The house is over there.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.875
The one where the smoke is. Let's go.

23:15.958 --> 23:16.833
Yeah.

23:28.708 --> 23:29.916
Stop. Easy.

23:33.083 --> 23:33.916
Yes, I know.

23:34.000 --> 23:34.833
Go on.

23:49.291 --> 23:50.791
There you go, Gaëtan.

23:57.583 --> 23:59.583
There. Stay strong, Gaëtan!

24:09.083 --> 24:13.166
MAISON YOUSSEF
CHOCOLATIER - PARIS

24:16.750 --> 24:17.875
Showtime!

24:17.958 --> 24:20.041
It's not at all showtime.
Don't get carried away.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.791
I'm sure that jerk's not our guy.

24:21.875 --> 24:24.208
In any case, your truck's awful.
It's fucking freezing.

24:24.291 --> 24:26.958
-It's hotter outside.
-I don't have a choice. It's a fridge.

24:27.041 --> 24:29.750
I have a life-size chocolate bust
of a soccer player here.

24:30.375 --> 24:32.666
I'm delivering it Wednesday.
That's 6,000 big ones,

24:32.750 --> 24:33.750
same as trading a player.

24:33.833 --> 24:35.500
-Holy cow!
-Yeah.

24:35.583 --> 24:38.000
That's really well done.
It totally looks like Lilian Thuram.

24:38.083 --> 24:39.750
That's Giroud. What are you saying?

24:39.833 --> 24:41.208
-Giroud?
-Yeah.

24:41.291 --> 24:42.750
Well, that's really bad.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.166
It's really shitty.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.583
It doesn't look like him at all.
The eyes are wrong.

24:47.666 --> 24:49.208
He's number nine. He's going like this…

24:49.291 --> 24:51.458
Wow. You have to start over. Sorry.

24:51.541 --> 24:54.000
Plus, he's just casually in blackface?

24:54.083 --> 24:56.750
That's so racist. Racist!

24:56.833 --> 25:00.291
It's not racist.
The guy just likes dark chocolate.

25:00.375 --> 25:01.708
That's what I'm saying.

25:01.791 --> 25:04.250
Liking dark chocolate is racist

25:04.833 --> 25:05.833
when you're white.

25:07.166 --> 25:09.291
-What are you doing there, my boy?
-It's working.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.500
I swear, it's working.

25:10.583 --> 25:12.000
Come on.

25:12.083 --> 25:13.416
Come in, sweetie.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.416
There. It worked.
We're gonna be able to listen in now.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.291
Here. Have a biscuit.

25:20.833 --> 25:21.666
Come on.

25:24.125 --> 25:24.958
Come on.

25:28.833 --> 25:31.875
That's not exactly how I thought
my boat would be.

25:33.208 --> 25:35.166
-That'll do.
-Damn, it's heating up.

25:38.333 --> 25:39.583
Come on.

25:51.541 --> 25:52.625
Tell me, Dad.

25:53.166 --> 25:55.041
How do you plan
to send off your little boat?

25:55.125 --> 25:56.833
Don't worry about that.

25:59.083 --> 26:00.291
I've got it covered.

26:13.583 --> 26:14.708
Go, my Béné.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.375
Sail.

26:18.083 --> 26:19.208
Sail away, my Béné.

26:27.166 --> 26:29.375
Shit! No!

26:29.458 --> 26:31.208
Don't do that to me, my Béné.

26:31.291 --> 26:32.375
Shit!

26:44.916 --> 26:46.541
Come on. Hurry up, Olive.

26:48.833 --> 26:49.916
Olive!

27:00.875 --> 27:02.125
Olive?

27:10.833 --> 27:11.916
Come here, son.

27:12.791 --> 27:14.541
Come and eat your bread.

27:14.625 --> 27:16.708
-Dad?
-Yeah, it's me.

27:16.791 --> 27:17.666
Come here.

27:20.958 --> 27:21.875
Here.

27:22.875 --> 27:26.875
I know I haven't been around lately,
but you still recognize me, don't you?

27:26.958 --> 27:28.416
Yeah, of course.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.833
I'm sorry. It hasn't been easy lately.

27:31.541 --> 27:32.500
I'm on the run.

27:32.583 --> 27:34.125
Shit! What did you do?

27:34.875 --> 27:37.375
Jacquo and I robbed a place
and it went south.

27:37.458 --> 27:39.708
We had to split
to get the cops off our case.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.208
See this?

27:42.625 --> 27:44.333
Jacquo Mesrine?

27:44.833 --> 27:45.833
Obviously.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.291
And anyway, it's pronounced "Mérine."

27:48.375 --> 27:50.625
You know that. Jacquo's your godfather.
Don't embarrass me.

27:50.708 --> 27:51.833
Yes, sorry.

27:52.416 --> 27:53.708
And don't ever forget.

27:54.333 --> 27:56.666
Like father, like son.

27:56.750 --> 27:57.583
Okay?

27:58.291 --> 28:00.791
-Like father, like son.
-That's it.

28:00.875 --> 28:02.166
That's good.

28:02.916 --> 28:03.875
Like son.

28:04.541 --> 28:05.541
Okay, Dad.

28:10.208 --> 28:11.291
Come here, you.

28:14.375 --> 28:15.500
How are you?

28:16.708 --> 28:17.583
Not great.

28:19.583 --> 28:20.875
You need to find Olive.

28:21.375 --> 28:23.416
Yeah, that's it. Go.

28:36.458 --> 28:37.333
Denis?

28:37.916 --> 28:39.916
Yes, it's Denis.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.250
Joseph, come join me.

28:48.750 --> 28:51.166
-Good evening.
-How are you, kids?

28:51.250 --> 28:53.625
How are you, sweethearts? Are you okay?

28:55.666 --> 28:56.666
Aïda.

28:57.916 --> 29:01.500
Has anyone found a self-immunity necklace

29:01.583 --> 29:04.125
and would like to use it tonight?

29:10.291 --> 29:11.125
Yes.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.958
Show it to me, Joseph.

29:13.708 --> 29:14.750
I don't have one.

29:14.833 --> 29:15.791
Very well.

29:16.500 --> 29:17.583
You've all voted.

29:18.291 --> 29:20.833
And now I will proceed to count the votes.

29:25.250 --> 29:26.666
Here's the first ballot.

29:33.583 --> 29:34.708
Joseph.

29:34.791 --> 29:35.750
Fuck. No.

29:36.250 --> 29:37.416
That was you, wasn't it?

29:41.041 --> 29:42.166
Joseph.

29:43.791 --> 29:45.166
I bet that was yours.

29:47.458 --> 29:48.916
Come on. William.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.083
William.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.250
Yes!

29:53.125 --> 29:56.041
That's my ballot. In your face. Asshole.

29:56.125 --> 29:57.791
Two votes against you, Joseph.

29:57.875 --> 29:59.875
One vote against William.

29:59.958 --> 30:01.000
William.

30:03.208 --> 30:04.500
-William.
-No.

30:05.458 --> 30:06.833
It's Joseph.

30:06.916 --> 30:07.916
What?

30:08.958 --> 30:10.541
Kids, did you vote against Dad?

30:12.708 --> 30:14.625
This is the second to last ballot.

30:15.125 --> 30:18.000
And it could be the deciding vote.

30:18.625 --> 30:20.916
Please be William.

30:21.000 --> 30:21.958
Joseph.

30:22.041 --> 30:23.750
Fuck, I can't believe it.

30:24.833 --> 30:26.916
I will proceed to the last ballot.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.500
Unfortunately,
it won't change the outcome.

30:30.583 --> 30:33.166
Well, what's the point? I'm out of here.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.583
-Joseph.
-Joseph.

30:36.666 --> 30:37.583
Yeah.

30:38.083 --> 30:39.583
Joseph, take your bag,

30:39.666 --> 30:42.875
pick up your torch, and come with me.

30:48.833 --> 30:49.708
Joseph,

30:49.791 --> 30:53.416
the adventurers
of the Hazan-Benkikir tribe

30:53.500 --> 30:55.208
have decided to eliminate you,

30:55.291 --> 30:57.625
and their sentence is irrevocable.

30:59.666 --> 31:01.000
Come stand next to me.

31:01.958 --> 31:04.791
You have the opportunity
to speak one last time

31:04.875 --> 31:07.041
before your family members.

31:09.041 --> 31:12.750
Well, I'm not gonna lie.
I'm really disappointed.

31:14.250 --> 31:15.375
Really sad.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.083
Aïda, I have one last request.

31:24.625 --> 31:26.166
If your drum gets banged

31:27.250 --> 31:28.083
by William,

31:28.666 --> 31:30.041
promise me, please,

31:30.583 --> 31:32.791
that you won't do it in front of the kids.

31:34.000 --> 31:34.916
That's dangerous.

31:37.208 --> 31:38.291
And, William,

31:38.958 --> 31:41.041
even though we don't care for each other,

31:43.041 --> 31:46.041
if you bang Aïda's drum…

31:46.541 --> 31:47.416
Yeah.

31:47.500 --> 31:48.333
…please,

31:49.791 --> 31:51.500
don't do it in front of the kids.

31:51.583 --> 31:55.708
Tell me, Joseph,
what do you mean by "bang her drum"?

31:57.208 --> 31:59.916
It's an expression

32:01.375 --> 32:03.000
that means "in the butt."

32:05.250 --> 32:06.208
All right.

32:06.958 --> 32:08.875
And some last words for my kids.

32:09.875 --> 32:11.000
Kids…

32:13.666 --> 32:15.791
if Mom gets banged by William,

32:17.166 --> 32:18.541
close your eyes, okay?

32:19.791 --> 32:20.791
It's dangerous.

32:24.416 --> 32:25.250
There you go.

32:25.333 --> 32:26.333
-Jo?
-Yeah?

32:27.708 --> 32:28.875
What are you doing?

32:32.083 --> 32:32.916
Nothing.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Let's get going.

32:34.625 --> 32:35.666
Let's move.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.125
It smells like shit.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.291
I'm gonna barf. I swear.

32:45.166 --> 32:46.875
Are you okay, Dad? Want a hand?

32:46.958 --> 32:50.333
Don't make things worse.
Can't you see I'm in enough shit already?

32:50.916 --> 32:51.958
Deep shit.

32:52.583 --> 32:54.208
There it is!

32:54.291 --> 32:57.208
It's gone. My Béné has left.

33:01.500 --> 33:02.916
What are you doing here?

33:03.458 --> 33:06.166
No idea.
They must think I'm working with you.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.250
Honey, I'm so happy to see you.

33:08.333 --> 33:11.166
I mean, I'm not happy.
But I'm happy anyway.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.083
Hold on. I'm covered in shit.

33:13.166 --> 33:15.041
-I was so scared.
-Honey.

33:15.833 --> 33:17.166
Where are the others?

33:17.875 --> 33:20.000
They took Grandma away when we got here.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.458
Some cartel took her.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.333
Oh my God, that's awful.

33:23.416 --> 33:26.041
No, you're safe. Don't worry.

33:26.125 --> 33:27.416
I'm here.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.041
I know how to handle criminals.

33:29.125 --> 33:31.250
What do you mean,
you can handle them, Dad?

33:31.333 --> 33:32.666
We found out they wanted to--

33:32.750 --> 33:35.125
Hold on. Don't worry her.

33:35.208 --> 33:38.291
Everything's fine, my love.

33:38.375 --> 33:41.250
Were Joseph and Olivier
taken by a cartel too?

33:41.333 --> 33:43.625
No, they were out of control and escaped.

33:45.166 --> 33:48.875
-Do you know where they went?
-Yes, to the little house by the forest.

33:48.958 --> 33:52.458
But I told Léonard they went to the sea
to throw them off the trail.

33:52.541 --> 33:55.875
It's an old Mossad technique.

33:56.375 --> 33:57.416
That's great.

33:57.500 --> 33:58.416
Perfect.

33:59.375 --> 34:00.791
My love.

34:00.875 --> 34:03.125
-Hold on.
-It's okay.

34:07.666 --> 34:09.375
I'm gonna go over here.

34:16.416 --> 34:19.041
Your mother gave me this to give to you.

34:19.750 --> 34:20.875
THEY WENT TO THE DISTILLERY

34:20.958 --> 34:21.916
Distillery?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.500
Go. What are you doing?

34:34.208 --> 34:36.541
I'm coming down. I feel better.

34:36.625 --> 34:38.000
Yeah, me too.

34:38.083 --> 34:39.458
I'm exhausted though.

34:39.541 --> 34:42.041
I'm so thirsty. My head hurts like crazy.

34:42.125 --> 34:44.625
Hang in there.
We're about 200 meters away.

34:46.958 --> 34:48.291
Isn't that a police siren?

34:48.916 --> 34:50.000
I don't hear it.

34:52.375 --> 34:53.875
Damn, it's a cop car.

34:53.958 --> 34:56.583
Hey! Stop!

34:56.666 --> 34:59.541
-Police!
-¡Policía!

35:02.333 --> 35:04.000
They're flashing their headlights.

35:04.750 --> 35:05.666
We come!

35:07.000 --> 35:08.291
Okay, we come!

35:08.375 --> 35:09.625
Let's go down there.

35:11.291 --> 35:13.416
Do you understand what I'm saying, señor?

35:38.166 --> 35:40.250
Yes, I understand.

35:40.333 --> 35:42.125
Don't worry.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.750
You're totally safe.

35:44.333 --> 35:46.375
We're gonna take care of your family too.

35:46.458 --> 35:48.500
But first, we're gonna go
to the police station.

35:49.750 --> 35:51.916
Police station.

35:52.958 --> 35:54.250
That's good.

35:54.333 --> 35:56.041
We're fucking saved!

35:57.208 --> 35:59.791
This is awesome.
We're gonna be able to get the others.

36:01.208 --> 36:02.750
Damn, I was so scared.

36:04.708 --> 36:06.583
Wait. Is that the monastery?

36:07.291 --> 36:08.958
They're taking us back to the monastery.

36:12.333 --> 36:14.458
It's all good. We're going home.

36:23.375 --> 36:24.708
Fuck, there's Léonard.

36:25.208 --> 36:27.875
-No, this can't be happening.
-No. Fuck.

36:27.958 --> 36:28.958
Unbelievable.

36:40.833 --> 36:44.375
So, you two fuckers, were you
gonna leave without saying goodbye?

36:45.125 --> 36:47.791
No, not at all. Olivier and I just--

36:47.875 --> 36:50.666
I don't even get a kiss
on the tip of my wiener?

36:53.583 --> 36:55.875
Didn't I tell you to watch your step?

36:57.250 --> 36:58.333
Yes.

36:59.375 --> 37:00.541
You want to play?

37:03.125 --> 37:04.458
Well, then we'll play.

38:08.833 --> 38:10.958
