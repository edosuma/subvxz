NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.404 --> 00:06.240
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.274 --> 00:08.509
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.542 --> 00:10.378
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.411 --> 00:12.113
are members of an elite squad

00:12.146 --> 00:13.714
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.549
These are their stories.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.454
( glass shatters )

00:21.822 --> 00:23.491
Come in, Central.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.495
CENTRAL ( over radio ):
10 Post 11.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.762
This is Central.
Go ahead.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.405
Got a 10-10 possible burglary
at Momma Sue's Restaurant.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.107
Request backup.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.574
CENTRAL:
That's a 10-4.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.099
( clattering,
officer gasps )

01:05.666 --> 01:06.800
Police!

01:06.834 --> 01:08.502
Let me see your hands!

01:08.536 --> 01:09.537
Now! Drop the gun!

01:09.570 --> 01:10.738
WOMAN:
Help me...

01:10.771 --> 01:11.439
Drop the piece
or I shoot!

01:11.472 --> 01:13.574
Please... somebody help me...

01:15.609 --> 01:16.777
Wait! Hold it!

01:16.810 --> 01:18.479
WOMAN:
Over here... please...

01:18.512 --> 01:19.780
Someone, someone
help me, please...

01:19.813 --> 01:22.550
10 Post 11, assault victim
at this location.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.751
Need a bus and SVU.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.619
You okay, Mrs. Fulton?

01:25.653 --> 01:26.520
It's okay.

01:26.554 --> 01:27.888
My head...

01:27.921 --> 01:29.523
CENTRAL:
10-4, Post 11.

01:29.557 --> 01:30.724
Bus is on the way.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.261
OFFICER:
Male, maybe Latino,

01:33.294 --> 01:34.762
late teens, dark jacket,
some kind of cap.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.364
All right, you get a look
at his face?

01:36.397 --> 01:38.399
Sorry. I was too busy
looking at his gun.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.634
I understand.
Thank you.

01:40.668 --> 01:41.735
Hey.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.337
Hey. Sorry to
wake you up.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.638
You didn't.

01:44.672 --> 01:45.639
I was helping the twins
with a science project.

01:45.673 --> 01:46.640
What do we got?

01:46.674 --> 01:48.142
The victim is
Jennifer Fulton.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.510
She owns the restaurant
with her husband.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.413
Now, the place was
closed, but front and
rear doors were open.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.781
Perp knocked her out
and he raped her.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.249
She always work this late?

01:55.283 --> 01:57.785
Sometimes she closes up,
sometimes the husband.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.787
The cops know them,
so they make a point
of checking in--

01:59.820 --> 02:01.622
which is what Officer
Breggin was doing--

02:01.655 --> 02:03.257
when he caught the perp
in the act.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.626
STABLER:
"B-I-C-H."

02:05.659 --> 02:06.927
Did the moron
rob the place?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.562
Night's take was
still in the register.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.598
Then either he didn't
get to finish the job,

02:10.631 --> 02:12.700
or this was personal.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.303
Where'd EMS take her?

02:15.336 --> 02:16.370
You almost missed her.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.606
She lost consciousness
and you're releasing her?

02:18.639 --> 02:20.341
Mrs. Fulton is
insisting she leave.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.575
She let you do a rape kit?

02:21.609 --> 02:23.844
Yes. We patched her up
as best we could.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.613
Jennifer, I'm Detective
Olivia Benson.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.582
This is my partner,
Elliot Stabler.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.319
Hello.
Uh, do I need to sign something?

02:31.352 --> 02:33.587
Mrs. Fulton, I'm urging you
to let us admit you
for the night.

02:33.621 --> 02:34.522
Look, Doctor, I'm fine.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.490
Honestly.
Now just show me where to sign.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.326
STABLER:
We just have
a few questions

02:38.359 --> 02:39.693
we'd like to ask you
about what happened.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.296
Of course.
Jennifer, did you
know your attacker?

02:42.330 --> 02:44.565
No.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.499
Can you describe him?

02:45.533 --> 02:47.535
Well, I'm afraid it
all happened so quickly.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.636
What about his clothes?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.571
His race?
Had he been drinking?

02:50.604 --> 02:52.673
Look, I was in the
middle of closing up,

02:52.706 --> 02:53.541
and he hit me
from behind.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.343
I'm sorry, I don't
remember anything.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.511
Okay, well, why don't you
go home and get some rest,

02:57.545 --> 02:58.612
and we'll talk
to you tomorrow.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.614
Look, thank you
for your concern,

03:00.648 --> 03:01.915
but really, I'm all right.

03:01.949 --> 03:02.883
STABLER:
You were assaulted.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.585
And I survived.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.355
Please, I just want
to put this behind me.

03:14.462 --> 03:18.566
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

04:01.909 --> 04:02.410
The rape kit was negative,

04:03.511 --> 04:06.414
but the ER confirmed that
Jennifer Fulton was assaulted.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.549
Denial is a normal
response to trauma.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.684
Well, either that or she's
scared that the creep
will try it again.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.420
Look at the graffiti, Captain.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.954
He's sending her a message.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.556
Well, if she was threatened,

04:15.589 --> 04:16.657
could explain
why she wouldn't talk.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.492
You run this past
the Gang Squad?

04:18.526 --> 04:19.693
They didn't recognize the tags.

04:19.727 --> 04:20.594
Could mean some wanna-be.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.663
Or a new recruit
trying to make his bones.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.965
Well, check with
the local precinct,

04:24.998 --> 04:27.801
see if the Fultons filed
any complaints recently.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.470
Talk to CSU--
maybe this guy

04:29.503 --> 04:32.005
left something besides
his bad spelling.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.445
O'HALLORAN:
We found skin, blood
and makeup.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.746
That explains
the cut on her temple.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.548
She fell or was pushed
into the counter.

04:40.581 --> 04:41.549
Yeah.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.850
No security cameras.

04:42.883 --> 04:43.784
But what about the paint?

04:43.817 --> 04:46.520
Available at any auto shop
or hardware store.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.356
In other words,
O'Halloran, you got zip.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.790
Hey, not so hasty, Munch.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.525
We're still checking the bar
for prints,

04:51.559 --> 04:53.494
and we found this
by the back door.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.628
What is it?

04:54.662 --> 04:56.630
Top of a new pack
of chewing gum.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.966
Not enough to print,
but it's something.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.568
MUNCH:
Why? Anybody
could've dropped it.

05:00.601 --> 05:01.702
I don't think so.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.971
Entryway was mopped right after
the restaurant closed.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.606
The floor was spotless.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.074
Except for this.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.008
Okay, kid breaks in,

05:08.041 --> 05:10.811
pops a piece of gum
to calm his nerves.

05:10.844 --> 05:11.679
Could've bought it nearby.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.681
He could've bought
it in Pittsburgh.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.049
We'll check the stores
around here first.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.520
Liv just called
from the two-nine.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.121
They've had no complaints
from the Fultons

05:21.154 --> 05:23.657
about gang harassment,
but Jennifer's been
in trouble before.

05:23.691 --> 05:24.725
What for?

05:24.758 --> 05:27.395
Undercover cop caught her
serving liquor to a minor.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.563
She said it was a mistake;
kid looked older than he was.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.665
It was her first offense.
She paid the fine.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.866
Was the kid cited?

05:32.900 --> 05:35.135
Yeah. 18-year-old
Leon Ardilles.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.804
His photo's being
faxed over now.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.739
Anybody who might want
to target the restaurant?

05:38.772 --> 05:40.574
Nothing that's come up.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.611
Momma Sue's is a restaurant
chain out of New Orleans.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.979
Jennifer and her husband own the
franchise for the West Village.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.748
We found the smoking gum.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.116
What's he talking about?

05:49.149 --> 05:50.518
We pulled
the security camera tapes

05:50.551 --> 05:51.519
from every convenience store

05:51.552 --> 05:54.021
within a ten-block radius
of the restaurant.

05:54.054 --> 05:54.788
We came up with this.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.624
( tape clicks into VCR )

05:56.657 --> 05:59.059
Latino male, late teens.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.729
15 minutes before
Officer Breggin came
by the restaurant.

06:01.762 --> 06:02.796
CRAGEN:
Store owner know the kid?

06:02.830 --> 06:03.697
FIN:
Nah.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.600
Get a printout,
canvass the neighborhood.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.836
Don't bother.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.505
This is Leon Ardilles,
our underage drinker.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.709
So's that.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.616
BENSON:
Did you see the man
who attacked you?

06:22.650 --> 06:24.952
I'm not sure.
It was... it was dark.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.554
Take your time, Jen.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.890
( sighs )

06:32.526 --> 06:35.162
I think it was him.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.497
You ever see him
before last night?

06:36.530 --> 06:37.498
He looks like the kid

06:37.531 --> 06:38.732
that was arrested in our bar

06:38.766 --> 06:39.967
for drinking last month.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.735
Yeah.
He was underage.

06:41.769 --> 06:45.072
He had the balls to blame Jen
for getting him in trouble.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.974
I should have never
left you alone to close up.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.942
Did you take the night off,
Mr. Fulton?

06:48.976 --> 06:50.878
Yeah, I had tickets
to the Knicks, second row.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.112
STABLER:
That was some game.
Thought Houston

06:52.145 --> 06:54.748
was going to pull it out
for them in the fourth.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.718
Houston fouled out in the third.
What game were you watching?

06:57.751 --> 07:00.821
I must be thinking about the
game the night before last.

07:00.854 --> 07:01.955
Right.

07:01.989 --> 07:05.626
Are you going to arrest the punk
who attacked my wife?

07:05.659 --> 07:07.495
FIN:
Remember her?

07:07.528 --> 07:08.596
Never seen her before.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.730
How about
I refresh your memory.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.199
Cops busted you
for drinking in her bar.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.734
Doesn't mean I roughed her up.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.602
MUNCH:
You did the lady,

07:14.635 --> 07:16.169
left your tag,
even faced down a cop.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.205
FIN:
Only thing we don't get
is why a big tough

07:18.238 --> 07:19.840
hombre like you
had to knock her out

07:19.873 --> 07:21.174
before you tried to rape her.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.043
Sounds like
performance anxiety to me.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.478
I swear I didn't touch her.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.846
Touched something.
Let go of me!

07:25.879 --> 07:27.180
That look like
orange paint to you?

07:27.214 --> 07:28.482
MUNCH:
Uh-huh.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.050
I might've guessed:

07:30.083 --> 07:33.487
NYPD's very own
civil rights busters.

07:33.521 --> 07:34.755
What do you want, Balthus?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.690
Some quality time
with my client.

07:36.724 --> 07:37.758
Yeah? Sorry.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.859
We're taking him
to the crime lab.

07:38.892 --> 07:39.860
BALTHUS:
What for?

07:39.893 --> 07:42.763
Test the paint on his hands.

07:42.796 --> 07:46.033
So this is where you fellas
cook the books.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.168
Why isn't this
in an evidence bag?

07:48.201 --> 07:50.604
Because it's my lunch.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.640
Oops.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.542
Well, look at this:
our crime scene.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.143
MUNCH:
Stay away from
there, Balthus.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.878
Listen, Munchkins,
I can see it now

07:57.911 --> 07:59.279
or I can see it in Discovery.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.682
O'HALLORAN:
Okay, I'll test the
sample in the GCMS--

08:01.715 --> 08:03.751
Gas Chromatograph
Mass Spectrometer.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.654
Which will tell you
that the paint on Leon's finger

08:06.687 --> 08:09.890
matches about a million
cans of spray paint.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.760
So, there was a glass

08:12.793 --> 08:14.862
and an open bottle of wine
on the bar,

08:14.895 --> 08:16.830
which you then dusted
for prints.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.666
And whose did you find?

08:18.699 --> 08:20.701
Jennifer Fulton.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.736
Here's another piece of
evidence, a broken wine glass.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.905
And what does the report say?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.840
"Found in trash behind bar.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.742
"Glass wiped clean

08:28.776 --> 08:31.111
but two partial prints
on base."

08:31.144 --> 08:32.846
Mrs. Fulton's, too?

08:32.880 --> 08:33.947
No. We're still looking.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.784
So, after the restaurant
was closed,

08:36.817 --> 08:38.218
Mrs. Fulton shared
a bottle of wine

08:38.251 --> 08:39.720
with some mystery person,

08:39.753 --> 08:42.823
who then wiped his prints
and left.

08:42.856 --> 08:46.994
Leon, did Mrs. Fulton invite you
in for a glass of wine?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.062
No, ma'am.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.698
I didn't think so.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.199
The paint's a match.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.767
You're cooked, Leon.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.870
Okay, I found the door open,

08:56.904 --> 08:58.839
I went in and tagged the place.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.808
I heard a moan
and I saw her lying there.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.710
I was gonna help her
when the cop came in.

09:02.743 --> 09:03.811
Criminal trespassing.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.078
I doubt
he'll even get probation.

09:05.112 --> 09:05.979
FIN:
Trespass?!

09:06.013 --> 09:08.015
The little psycho had a gun.
Gun? What gun?

09:08.048 --> 09:09.850
Did you find a gun? No.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.585
I'll see you at arraignment.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.153
Not another word.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.155
FIN:
The kid admits
he was there, Captain.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.790
Officer Breggin swears
he was armed.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.126
And the victim I.D.'d him.
We still got a good case.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.694
If you hadn't given his attorney

09:20.728 --> 09:22.796
a sneak preview
of the forensics.

09:22.830 --> 09:23.897
Why the hell did you
let her in there?

09:23.931 --> 09:24.998
We didn't have a choice.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.200
She would've got the evidence
in Discovery anyway.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.804
Well, we still have to I.D.
Mrs. Fulton's mystery boyfriend.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.673
Elliot and Olivia
are looking at everybody

09:32.706 --> 09:34.341
who worked at the restaurant
after hours.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.008
Give them a hand.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.309
STABLER:
May not need one.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.979
We checked out
her husband Craig.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.682
Turns out he took a couple
collars for domestic violence.

09:41.715 --> 09:42.916
So we got his prints.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.652
STABLER:
They're sealed.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.686
Cases never made it to court.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.054
Jennifer dropped all charges.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.889
Doesn't mean Craig
assaulted her this time.

09:48.922 --> 09:49.757
Yeah, but it may be

09:49.790 --> 09:51.792
why they're not living together
anymore.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.126
Craig moved out six months ago.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.128
Then why the loving couple act?

09:55.162 --> 09:57.030
BENSON:
Because the
restaurant franchise

09:57.064 --> 09:58.131
is in both their names.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.701
Momma Sue's head office
in New Orleans just told me

10:00.734 --> 10:01.835
that if the Fultons split up

10:01.869 --> 10:03.136
or if they get in
any legal trouble,

10:03.170 --> 10:04.905
they could lose the restaurant.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.840
So they're staying married
for the money.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.008
Uh, no, there is no money.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.977
The head office says that
the restaurant's in trouble.

10:10.010 --> 10:10.911
The profits are in the toilet.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.312
They were thinking
of closing the place.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.915
That's a recipe for violence.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.784
I'll tell you who
will have hubby's prints:

10:16.817 --> 10:18.085
the State
Liquor Authority.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.153
Get the lab to run 'em
against the partials.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.689
And maybe you should
ask Jennifer

10:21.722 --> 10:23.757
who she shared that
romantic bottle of wine with.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.360
Why are you questioning me?

10:27.394 --> 10:28.696
I thought I was the victim here.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.799
Jennifer, the defense
is going to dig into
your personal life

10:31.832 --> 10:32.599
to undermine your case.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.934
You've got to tell
me everything.

10:33.967 --> 10:34.902
I have.

10:34.935 --> 10:35.869
Well, you didn't tell me

10:35.903 --> 10:37.705
that you and your
husband were separated.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.842
It's not official.
I want a divorce, he doesn't.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.945
Look, I really don't want
to talk about this.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.883
Mrs. Fulton, think about
what you're doing.

10:49.917 --> 10:50.984
I know what I'm doing.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.920
I am trying
to keep my life together.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.988
If you guys can't help me,
please leave me alone.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.323
We're on your side.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.225
Jennifer, we know
that you were attacked.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.995
We know that Leon Ardilles
had a grudge against you.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.197
But did he try to rape you?

11:16.977 --> 11:19.046
Jennifer...

11:19.079 --> 11:20.380
was it Leon?

11:22.415 --> 11:24.117
No. I'm sorry.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.352
It wasn't him.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.923
It was your husband,
wasn't it.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.195
( sighs heavily )

11:35.228 --> 11:38.732
He came around after closing,

11:38.766 --> 11:40.267
he said he wanted to talk.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.136
So you opened a
bottle of wine.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.239
At first he was civil,
then he started

11:46.273 --> 11:49.910
accusing me of running the
restaurant into the ground.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.311
He said that
if I divorced him,

11:51.344 --> 11:53.947
he'd cut me out
of the franchise.

11:53.981 --> 11:56.049
I said, "Over my dead body."

11:56.083 --> 11:57.951
And he got violent.

11:57.985 --> 12:01.021
He ripped my shirt...

12:01.054 --> 12:04.958
he shoved his hand
between my legs and...

12:04.992 --> 12:08.862
said that he could do
whatever he wanted to me.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.463
I begged him to stop,
but he wouldn't,

12:10.497 --> 12:12.199
not until I told him
I was pregnant

12:12.232 --> 12:13.533
and then he let go.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.803
And I tried to run and I fell.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.004
Are you pregnant?

12:19.940 --> 12:20.908
( sighs )

12:20.941 --> 12:22.776
11 weeks.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.346
And Craig's the father.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.250
We tried to get back together
for the sake of the business.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.887
We had sex once or twice,
but it didn't work.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.322
Obviously the sex worked.

12:39.292 --> 12:42.029
Will you testify against him?

12:44.097 --> 12:45.833
No, I-I can't...

12:45.866 --> 12:47.334
We can protect you.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.970
Jennifer...

12:50.003 --> 12:53.106
if you let this go again...

12:53.140 --> 12:55.008
the next time,
he might kill you.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.581
You will protect me.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.985
Yes.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.658
WOMAN:
Why are we here?

13:11.691 --> 13:14.094
Mrs. Fulton identified
Leon Ardilles as her attacker.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.963
Yeah. She recanted her I.D.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.931
Well, then Mrs. Fulton
is an unreliable witness.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.199
Who she going to finger next?

13:19.232 --> 13:20.333
BENSON:
Your client.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.202
You're a liar.
I never touched Jen!

13:22.235 --> 13:23.837
You beat her up
just like you beat her before.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.138
And as soon as Forensics puts
you at the scene,

13:25.172 --> 13:26.139
we're going to throw your ass
in jail.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.842
No, the only thing
that Forensics will prove

13:28.876 --> 13:30.477
is that my client was
in his own restaurant.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.879
Drinking wine
with his wife.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.047
You didn't wipe
all your prints off

13:34.081 --> 13:35.615
the glass there,
smart guy.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.850
You don't have
my prints.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.051
No, no. The State took them when

13:38.085 --> 13:39.987
you got your liquor
license. You remember?

13:40.020 --> 13:41.354
Craig, don't say anything.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.355
No, I want to.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.024
Jen was telling the truth.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.125
I was at the restaurant.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.159
After the Knick game,

13:46.193 --> 13:48.896
I went over to talk
about saving the business.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.999
Jen had been drinking.
She wouldn't listen.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.868
She told me she had bigger
problems, like being pregnant.

13:54.902 --> 13:55.802
I lost my temper.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.304
Right. And you beat
the crap out of her.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.305
No! I begged her

13:58.338 --> 13:59.139
to stop drinking,

13:59.172 --> 14:00.908
if not for her sake,
for our kid's.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.043
She told me it was none
of my business.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.978
She went to grab her purse,
I tried to get her keys.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.314
Must be when
her blouse got ripped.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.017
Yeah. I grabbed her by the arm,
she pulled away.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.919
She was unsteady on her feet.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.120
She fell and she hit her head.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.087
And then you ran out.

14:14.121 --> 14:15.088
What a gentleman.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.390
Look, I know
I should've stayed
there with her,

14:17.424 --> 14:18.391
but I was afraid

14:18.425 --> 14:24.031
she was going to call the cops
and blame me.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.101
ATTORNEY:
Jennifer is pregnant.
Craig doesn't want to put her

14:28.135 --> 14:30.037
through the strain of a trial.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.038
How noble of him.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.640
What kind of deal
would you client like to make?

14:33.673 --> 14:35.542
He'll take a Serrano plea
to Assault Three

14:35.575 --> 14:37.344
in exchange for
misdemeanor probation.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.411
Get real, Nikki.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.048
I won't accept a no contest plea
for attempted rape

14:41.081 --> 14:42.182
when your client
has a history

14:42.215 --> 14:43.216
of domestic violence.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.218
Jennifer dropped all charges.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.653
I have a confession.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.022
I have a complainant.
I'm going to trial.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.190
With what?
You've zero

14:50.223 --> 14:51.491
medical evidence of a rape

14:51.524 --> 14:53.693
and your complainant
first blamed her attack

14:53.726 --> 14:55.095
on a disadvantaged kid.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.196
Not to mention the fact

14:56.229 --> 14:57.931
that she drinks
while she's pregnant.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.100
That makes it okay
to beat her up?

15:00.133 --> 15:01.601
That was an accident.

15:01.634 --> 15:02.835
He was protecting
his unborn child.

15:02.869 --> 15:06.139
I get this in front of a jury,
he'll probably be acquitted.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.678
Fulton takes the plea and agrees
to a restraining order

15:11.711 --> 15:14.047
barring him from contact
with Jennifer.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.483
Any harassment
and I will lock him up.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.652
STABLER:
You made a deal
with that idiot?

15:19.686 --> 15:21.454
I take him to trial,
I'm not sure I'd win.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.190
So what will it take
to convince you?

15:23.223 --> 15:24.591
Broken bones?
Or maybe a dead body?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.459
Jennifer Fulton didn't exactly
help her case

15:26.493 --> 15:27.627
by fingering
the wrong guy.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.496
Oh, so now rape victims have
to be perfect

15:29.529 --> 15:31.698
before you'll bother
to prosecute the rapist?

15:31.731 --> 15:33.600
I prosecute cases
I have a chance at winning.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.567
Well, hang around

15:34.601 --> 15:36.203
'cause you'll be
prosecuting him
for murder.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.404
The number one cause
of death

15:37.437 --> 15:39.006
among pregnant women
is homicide,

15:39.039 --> 15:40.440
usually at the hands
of their partners.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.309
Craig Fulton goes
within 200 yards
of Jennifer,

15:42.342 --> 15:43.410
he's in jail.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.178
Oh, great,
that'll stop him.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.214
Let's go give her
the good news.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.151
I can't believe
you're letting him go.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.020
He pled out
to sexual assault.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.021
That will be
on his record.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.289
And that's a punishment?
After nearly killing me?

15:56.323 --> 15:57.490
You promised
you'd protect me.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.627
If he comes near you again,
if he threatens you in any way,

16:00.660 --> 16:01.694
we will arrest him.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.063
Can you be
by my side

16:03.096 --> 16:05.698
24 hours a day?

16:05.732 --> 16:07.234
I wish I'd never
listened to you.

16:07.267 --> 16:10.170
You think you've
had enough, there,
Jennifer?

16:10.203 --> 16:11.504
I know what's enough, okay?

16:11.538 --> 16:12.739
Please don't lecture me.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.608
I'd like you to go.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.645
Jennifer, I know
that we let you down,

16:18.678 --> 16:21.114
but if you need help,
we can recommend counselors.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.252
I don't need counseling.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.354
You know alcohol's not good
for the baby.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.325
I'm not having the baby.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.435
If you need me,

16:42.469 --> 16:44.404
this is my home number.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.346
( phone ringing )

17:00.520 --> 17:02.289
Hello?

17:02.322 --> 17:06.793
Yeah, yeah, it's me.

17:06.826 --> 17:09.496
He did what?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.498
Where are you?

17:11.531 --> 17:12.499
I'm really sorry.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.101
I shouldn't have
dragged you out

17:14.134 --> 17:15.268
in the middle
of the night.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.269
That's okay, Jennifer.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.104
Just tell me
what happened.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.406
A woman came in
just before we closed.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.808
She said she had something
for my husband.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.042
She gave me this.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.546
It's a temporary
restraining order.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.248
Yeah, to stop me
from having an abortion.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.549
I have to go
to court tomorrow.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.751
Can he really do this?

17:33.853 --> 17:34.987
No, he can't.

17:35.021 --> 17:37.624
Not unless someone re-wrote
New York State law overnight.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.491
So I can ignore it?

17:38.525 --> 17:40.227
You've been served,
you have to appear.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.761
Even if the
restraining order

17:41.794 --> 17:43.263
has no legal standing?

17:43.296 --> 17:44.331
I'm afraid so.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.299
He can just drag me into court,

17:46.333 --> 17:49.102
parade me around in public
any time he wants?

17:49.136 --> 17:50.170
Don't worry.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.239
New York recognizes a woman's
right to privacy.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.274
Even a pro-lifer like
Judge Rebard will have

17:54.307 --> 17:55.508
to dismiss the order.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.810
How did Craig manage to get
his case heard before Rebard?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.146
I was wondering
that myself.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.880
I think I know the answer:

18:00.913 --> 18:02.249
Felicity Bradshaw.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.451
She's a well-known
pro-life attorney.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.887
Defends anti-abortion activists,
even clinic bombers.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.189
She's connected enough
to get this

18:09.222 --> 18:09.989
on Judge Rebard's calendar.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.324
But you can stop him,
can't you?

18:11.358 --> 18:12.759
I'm an Assistant
District Attorney.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.461
I can't fight this for you.

18:14.494 --> 18:17.830
But I can recommend someone
who will-- Lorna Scarry.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.799
I thought she only handled
Wall Street embezzlers.

18:19.832 --> 18:20.767
She salves her conscience

18:20.800 --> 18:24.271
by doing pro bono work
for women's groups.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.306
I've been up against her twice.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.608
She wiped the floor
with me both times.

18:32.245 --> 18:35.282
SCARRY:
Aside from the fact it has no
validity under the law,

18:35.315 --> 18:37.450
this order is a blatant attempt
by Mr. Fulton

18:37.484 --> 18:39.852
to harass and intimidate
his wife.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.422
My client can't even manage
his own restaurant

18:42.455 --> 18:44.757
because of his wife's
restraining order.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.393
He has to come to the court

18:46.426 --> 18:48.461
just to discuss
business with her.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.296
JUDGE:
Don't try to use me

18:49.329 --> 18:51.264
as a marriage counselor,
Mrs. Bradshaw.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.265
I'm not, Your Honor.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.833
Mr. Fulton wants to prevent

18:53.866 --> 18:55.735
the termination of his child,

18:55.768 --> 18:57.370
but he fully acknowledges

18:57.404 --> 18:59.872
the burdens that this
would impose upon his wife.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.342
He's willing
to fund alcohol
rehabilitation...

19:02.375 --> 19:03.443
What is she
talking about?

19:03.476 --> 19:04.511
I'm not an alcoholic.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.745
JUDGE:
Mrs. Fulton, please.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.013
What kind of lies have
you been telling her?

19:07.046 --> 19:09.849
BRADSHAW:
Mr. Fulton will pay for
alcohol rehabilitation

19:09.882 --> 19:12.452
and provide financial
support for his wife

19:12.485 --> 19:14.887
during her pregnancy,
and take custody

19:14.921 --> 19:16.956
of the child after it's born.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.426
Ms. Scarry, does your client
wish for time

19:19.459 --> 19:20.860
to consider this offer?

19:20.893 --> 19:22.929
Not in a million years.
He doesn't even like children.

19:22.962 --> 19:26.333
We are impressed by Mr. Fulton's
generosity, Your Honor,

19:26.366 --> 19:27.534
but we know he's broke.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.402
Where will the funding
come from?

19:29.436 --> 19:31.738
A group I'm associated with,
Agnus Dei,

19:31.771 --> 19:34.407
would happily pay for Mrs.
Fulton's rehabilitation.

19:34.441 --> 19:35.975
That group
is a well-known

19:36.008 --> 19:37.544
religious organization,
Your Honor.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.679
Now they're trying to re-write
the Constitution

19:39.712 --> 19:41.614
and erode my client's
reproductive rights.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.250
Ms. Scarry,
you should be aware

19:43.283 --> 19:45.785
that Apnus Dei also has
a Constitutional right

19:45.818 --> 19:47.520
to express their beliefs.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.590
Nonetheless, the order
to prevent a termination

19:50.623 --> 19:52.492
has no standing under the law.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.461
The case is dismissed.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.563
Mrs. Fulton,
I know that you

19:56.596 --> 19:58.898
and your husband
are at war,

19:58.931 --> 20:02.569
but before you hurry off
to the clinic, ask yourself:

20:02.602 --> 20:06.439
does your child have to become
an innocent casualty?

20:09.442 --> 20:11.444
He has no right
to dispense
personal advice.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.413
The decision
to terminate
the pregnancy

20:13.446 --> 20:14.781
is yours alone,
Jennifer.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.849
Jen! Jen! Jennifer, I'm sorry.

20:16.883 --> 20:17.850
I really am.

20:17.884 --> 20:18.751
Walk away, Mr. Fulton.

20:18.785 --> 20:19.886
You're still under
a restraining order.

20:19.919 --> 20:22.522
I was just trying to help,
that's all I was trying to do.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.556
It got out of hand.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.292
You've wanted a
baby for so long.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.394
Please, don't do this
just to punish me!

20:27.427 --> 20:28.761
Back off or I
will arrest you.

20:28.795 --> 20:29.962
Craig, that's enough.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.801
Jennifer, do not let him
get to you.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.903
He only wants you
to keep this child

20:36.936 --> 20:38.838
so he can have control
over you.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.674
I'm going to
have the baby.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.576
Because of what he just said?

20:43.610 --> 20:44.511
No, because

20:44.544 --> 20:46.012
it's what I really want.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.449
It's a decision
only you can make

20:49.482 --> 20:51.718
I wish you the best.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.489
I'm sorry for getting
you into this.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.458
Do you really want
to keep this child?

20:58.491 --> 21:00.627
Yes, more than anything.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.595
Maybe you should still
talk to a counselor

21:02.629 --> 21:03.696
so that you're fully informed.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.367
Do you know anyone?

21:11.504 --> 21:13.673
WOMAN:
If the mom has
seven or more drinks a week

21:13.706 --> 21:16.709
or four or more drinks
on any one occasion,

21:16.743 --> 21:20.447
her child could be born
with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.449
Do you know what that is?

21:22.482 --> 21:23.616
Uh, sort of.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.318
No, not really.

21:25.352 --> 21:28.788
Children with FAS can have
abnormal facial features,

21:28.821 --> 21:31.090
along with growth
and neurological
problems.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.124
They can also

21:32.158 --> 21:35.895
have problems with memory,
speech and hearing.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.597
So, if Jennifer
stops drinking now,

21:37.630 --> 21:38.598
will the baby be all right?

21:38.631 --> 21:39.466
I'm afraid

21:39.499 --> 21:41.434
there's a slight
chance it won't be.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.603
We know that heavy drinking
in the first trimester

21:43.636 --> 21:46.573
can cause the physical
characteristics of FAS.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.541
So exactly how much
alcohol is safe?

21:48.575 --> 21:50.443
Even moderate
social drinkers

21:50.477 --> 21:53.380
can have children with
alcohol-related problems.

21:53.413 --> 21:56.649
So to be safe,
we say no alcohol.

21:56.683 --> 21:59.486
Okay, so I'm
a moderate social drinker.

21:59.519 --> 22:01.588
Tell me the truth.
What's my risk?

22:01.621 --> 22:02.822
Put a number on it.

22:02.855 --> 22:03.856
I can't.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.092
We don't know why one fetus
is born with FAS,

22:06.125 --> 22:08.595
while another with
a similar exposure to alcohol

22:08.628 --> 22:09.762
is born healthy.

22:09.796 --> 22:13.633
All I can say is
that if you plan
to have the baby,

22:13.666 --> 22:16.603
stop drinking now.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.839
Get help if you need it,
but stop.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.513
Thanks for
coming with me.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.514
It's no problem.

22:27.547 --> 22:28.848
You want to talk,
call me.

22:28.881 --> 22:29.849
I'll be okay.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.518
Olivia, I mean it.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.586
I'm going to
clean up my act.

22:35.588 --> 22:36.689
See you later.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.562
Jen, can I talk to you
for a second?

22:42.595 --> 22:43.696
No, wh-what
are you doing?

22:43.730 --> 22:44.731
Well, Craig wanted
me to come by and...

22:44.764 --> 22:45.932
Police, show me your hands!

22:45.965 --> 22:48.000
Jen, get back
in the car.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.469
Okay, okay.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.470
Tell her I'm family, man.

22:50.503 --> 22:51.671
Come on,
tell her.

22:51.704 --> 22:52.872
Tell her
I'm family.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.541
You know this guy?

22:54.574 --> 22:56.443
It's Craig's brother.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.644
What do you want?

22:57.677 --> 22:59.912
Craig just said
to give Jen this.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.450
( sighs )

23:06.553 --> 23:07.554
Another court order.

23:07.587 --> 23:10.056
Doesn't this worm give up?

23:10.089 --> 23:11.591
JENNIFER:
Josh, you
better go.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.428
What now?

23:15.462 --> 23:17.764
He's brought an action
against you in Family Court

23:17.797 --> 23:19.566
for derivative neglect.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.434
What the hell
does that mean?

23:21.468 --> 23:22.802
That you're a threat
to your baby.

23:24.704 --> 23:25.605
He wants the statee JHe

23:25.638 --> 23:28.708
to lock you up,
to make you stop drinking.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.115
She's having an abortion,
so Craig takes her to court.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.116
She decides to have the baby,

23:37.149 --> 23:38.551
and again
he drags her into court.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.519
What the hell
does this guy want?

23:39.552 --> 23:41.488
Power over Jennifer.
He's a control freak.

23:41.521 --> 23:42.622
Yeah, a clever
control freak.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.991
Family Court has to act
in the interests of the child,

23:45.024 --> 23:46.493
whether it's born or unborn.

23:46.526 --> 23:47.494
Well, you know, Liv,

23:47.527 --> 23:48.861
even if Jennifer
loses this case,

23:48.895 --> 23:50.497
what's the worst thing
that can happen?

23:50.530 --> 23:51.764
She goes to rehab.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.601
Which will help her and the kid,
and I don't see a problem there.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.102
BENSON:
Aren't you
overlooking something?

23:56.135 --> 23:57.236
Her husband tried to rape her,

23:57.269 --> 23:59.972
and yet she's the one
being treated like a criminal.

24:00.006 --> 24:02.475
And what do you call a mother
who drinks when she's pregnant,

24:02.509 --> 24:04.143
even though she knows
it can hurt her baby?

24:04.176 --> 24:06.746
She's not drinking now,
and even if she was,

24:06.779 --> 24:08.515
the fact is, it's not a crime.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.982
Whatever we think
doesn't matter.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.884
This isn't
a Special Victims case anymore,

24:11.918 --> 24:13.052
so we should move on.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.521
BENSON:
Captain, she's
still a victim.

24:14.554 --> 24:15.822
Craig would say
his unborn child

24:15.855 --> 24:17.156
is the victim.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.859
Craig left his pregnant wife
bleeding on the floor.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.994
He doesn't give a damn
about that child.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.697
He's only using it as leverage
to attack Jennifer.

24:24.731 --> 24:27.166
Just like he's using
the courts to harass her.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.001
CRAGEN:
So, what do you want
to do, Olivia?

24:29.035 --> 24:30.169
I want to keep an eye on him,

24:30.202 --> 24:31.270
and make sure
that his harassment

24:31.303 --> 24:32.939
doesn't turn
into something criminal.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.007
Think he'd be that stupid?

24:35.041 --> 24:38.911
If he got angry enough, yeah.

24:41.047 --> 24:44.116
BRADSHAW:
No one disputes Ms. Fulton

24:44.150 --> 24:45.785
is a well-meaning
professional

24:45.818 --> 24:48.187
who wants what's best
for her child,

24:48.220 --> 24:50.022
but good intentions
have not protected her baby

24:50.056 --> 24:51.090
from her drinking.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.659
SCARRY:
Platitudes aside,

24:52.692 --> 24:54.794
Ms. Bradshaw is trying
to give a 12-week old fetus

24:54.827 --> 24:56.028
rights which no
court in the land

24:56.062 --> 24:57.029
would acknowledge.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.999
If the fetus can't
survive outside the womb,

25:00.032 --> 25:01.934
it's not a person
under the law.

25:01.968 --> 25:04.604
Surgeons can operate
on a fetus at 18 weeks.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.072
If a fetus can be
a patient,

25:06.105 --> 25:07.907
how can it not be
a person?

25:07.940 --> 25:09.141
Because in such
procedures

25:09.175 --> 25:10.142
the mother is
the patient,

25:10.176 --> 25:12.078
and her consent
is required.

25:12.111 --> 25:14.113
Counselors,
let's stick to the law.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.247
BRADSHAW:
Ms. Scarry

25:15.281 --> 25:18.217
chooses to forget that New York
law does give the fetus

25:18.250 --> 25:21.554
rights as a person in cases
of homicide and negligence.

25:21.588 --> 25:24.123
Gloria C. versus William C.
and New York versus

25:24.156 --> 25:25.558
Sierra K.

25:25.592 --> 25:27.093
The court institutionalized
Sierra K.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.195
because she was a crack addict
who had given birth

25:29.228 --> 25:31.631
to five addicted babies
and was pregnant with her sixth.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.966
My client has had no children

25:34.000 --> 25:36.769
and has no record
of parental neglect.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.638
Furthermore,
crack is an illegal drug.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.573
My client's
social drinking

25:40.607 --> 25:42.008
is perfectly legal.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.043
Your client
is an alcoholic.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.945
That's enough, Ms. Bradshaw.

25:45.978 --> 25:48.214
Can you prove
Mrs. Fulton's drinking

25:48.247 --> 25:50.149
is putting her child at risk?

25:50.182 --> 25:53.820
Affidavits from Jennifer's
colleagues and teachers

25:53.853 --> 25:57.123
attesting to her lifelong
addiction to alcohol.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.691
I can present
eyewitnesses,

25:58.725 --> 26:01.227
including Mrs. Fulton's
husband and Detective Benson

26:01.260 --> 26:05.164
who both have observed Jennifer
drinking since she's known

26:05.197 --> 26:06.966
she was pregnant.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.100
Your Honor, now
that she's aware

26:08.134 --> 26:11.604
of the possible harmful effects
of alcohol on her baby,

26:11.638 --> 26:13.873
Jennifer has pledged
to stop drinking.

26:13.906 --> 26:14.707
She has no record

26:14.741 --> 26:18.110
of erratic behavior,
no DUI citations.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.913
She's a hard-working woman
being pursued by an abusive,

26:20.947 --> 26:22.081
vindictive husband

26:22.114 --> 26:24.183
and his ideologically
motivated lawyer.

26:24.216 --> 26:25.051
BRADSHAW:
Your Honor...

26:25.084 --> 26:26.953
JUDGE:
I know your position, Counselor.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.387
I will review the materials,

26:28.420 --> 26:31.658
and I will decide if I want
to hear any witnesses.

26:31.691 --> 26:32.992
We're adjourned.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.593
( pounds gavel )

26:36.195 --> 26:37.664
How'd it go?

26:37.697 --> 26:39.999
Okay. Bradshaw's really
stretching the case law.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.000
And how's Jennifer?

26:41.033 --> 26:42.168
She's hanging in there,

26:42.201 --> 26:43.369
but Bradshaw's been
digging up dirt.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.004
Hubby's come up
with some witnesses,

26:45.037 --> 26:47.139
including me.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.876
This bastard's going
to do anything to win.

26:49.909 --> 26:50.910
Scarry said
it'd be a good idea

26:50.943 --> 26:53.179
to check these people out,
do some damage control.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.914
We just got six names.
Let's split 'em up.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.148
Thanks.

26:56.182 --> 26:59.752
Elliot, did Cathy drink
when she was pregnant?

27:01.921 --> 27:04.791
Glass of wine every
now and then. Why?

27:04.824 --> 27:06.258
I've been reading
this FAS literature.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.194
Did you know that
even one night's drinking

27:08.227 --> 27:09.862
can cause
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome?

27:09.896 --> 27:12.198
I didn't know that.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.365
Guess we just
got lucky.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.367
Right, but knowing that now,
if she got pregnant again,

27:15.401 --> 27:17.169
would you let her?

27:17.203 --> 27:20.339
If Cathy got pregnant again,
I'd shoot myself.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.876
Seriously, look, she gave me
four healthy kids.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.813
I trust her to make
her own decision.

27:29.381 --> 27:30.717
That's it.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.251
Thanks.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.357
DUNNE:
I haven't seen Jenny
in 20 years,

27:38.390 --> 27:40.727
and now you're
the second person this week

27:40.760 --> 27:43.195
that's asking about her.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.731
Really? Who
else was here?

27:44.764 --> 27:45.898
Uh, her husband.

27:45.932 --> 27:48.300
He wanted to surprise her
for her birthday

27:48.334 --> 27:50.369
with some stories
about her school days.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.271
Yeah. What'd
you tell him?

27:52.304 --> 27:54.807
Ooh, just that
she was a good student,

27:54.841 --> 27:56.208
very bright, and, uh...

27:56.242 --> 28:00.046
some nights
she had a wild side.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.748
How would you define
"wild side"?

28:01.781 --> 28:03.049
Oh, she was young,

28:03.082 --> 28:06.218
she liked to push
the boundaries, and, uh...

28:06.252 --> 28:11.457
mm, sometimes
she came to class drunk.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.960
School suspend her?

28:13.993 --> 28:15.995
Not exactly.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.964
She-she took the semester off.

28:17.997 --> 28:21.033
You know, I really
shouldn't be telling you this.

28:21.067 --> 28:24.403
Ms. Dunne...

28:24.436 --> 28:26.939
her husband's a liar.

28:26.973 --> 28:29.842
He's just trying
to hurt her in court.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.711
I need to know everything
that you told him.

28:36.816 --> 28:40.787
I-I didn't tell him
why she left school.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.822
Please tell me.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.324
She was pregnant.

28:45.357 --> 28:48.160
I helped her
to find a home

28:48.194 --> 28:49.996
for unwed mothers.

28:50.029 --> 28:52.164
She came to me
because

28:52.198 --> 28:53.833
she had no one else
to turn to.

28:53.866 --> 28:56.869
Her mother didn't care,
and her father had disappeared.

28:56.903 --> 28:59.171
What happened to the baby?

28:59.205 --> 29:03.142
Oh, she gave it up
for adoption.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.510
That was the end of it?

29:04.543 --> 29:06.245
About four years later,

29:06.278 --> 29:08.414
the adoption agency
contacted me.

29:08.447 --> 29:12.284
They... Jenny had given them
my name, and they said that, uh,

29:12.318 --> 29:16.355
they had lost touch with her,
and they needed to find her.

29:16.388 --> 29:17.356
They say why?

29:17.389 --> 29:18.424
No.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.159
I told them
where to contact her,

29:20.192 --> 29:22.361
and that was the last I heard.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.365
Lily?

29:26.398 --> 29:28.300
There are some people
here to see you.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.435
Hello, Lily.

29:29.468 --> 29:32.171
I'm Elliot, this is
my friend, Olivia.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.405
Hi, Elliot,
hi, Olivia.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.808
Do you want to
play cards with us?

29:35.842 --> 29:38.811
Heck, yeah.
Whatcha playing?

29:38.845 --> 29:40.847
Go Fish.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.915
Ah, that's my game.
Deal me in.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.253
My wife and I
adopted Lily

29:47.286 --> 29:48.287
about 17 years ago.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.489
And when did you notice
that something was wrong?

29:50.522 --> 29:51.557
Oh, we started
to notice

29:51.590 --> 29:52.491
when she was
about three.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.326
She was having
coordination
problems,

29:54.360 --> 29:56.328
and she seemed slower
than kids her age.

29:56.362 --> 29:58.364
We thought it might help
to find out

29:58.397 --> 29:59.899
her parents' medical history.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.600
So you contacted
the birth mother?

30:01.633 --> 30:04.203
The adoption agency's
records were a mess,

30:04.236 --> 30:07.373
but we found out through
a former teacher an address.

30:07.406 --> 30:12.011
We wrote, we phoned,
but... nobody answered.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.350
You should have told us,
Jennifer.

30:18.384 --> 30:19.952
I didn't think
it mattered.

30:19.986 --> 30:21.287
I mean, I was
just a kid.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.989
Your daughter's
adoptive parents

30:23.022 --> 30:24.123
tried to contact you.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.391
Why didn't you respond?

30:25.424 --> 30:26.492
I'd given up my baby.

30:26.525 --> 30:29.128
I couldn't bear to go
through all that pain again.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.529
So you just put her
out of your mind.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.398
No! No, never.

30:32.431 --> 30:36.235
Not a day goes by that
I don't think about her

30:36.268 --> 30:39.138
and pray that
her family loves her.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.340
They do.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.079
You've seen her?

30:47.113 --> 30:48.447
BENSON:
Yes,

30:48.480 --> 30:50.416
and we think that
you should, too.

30:50.449 --> 30:54.553
Her name is Lily,
and she's a sweet, loving kid.

30:54.586 --> 30:57.456
She has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.461
Oh, God.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.269
What if this baby has it, too?

31:10.302 --> 31:12.038
Well, I called
the FAS

31:12.071 --> 31:14.941
counselor, and she said
in families where a child

31:14.974 --> 31:16.075
already has FAS,

31:16.108 --> 31:19.445
the chances of a sibling
having it go up dramatically.

31:19.478 --> 31:22.014
Please don't tell
anyone about this.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.449
Don't tell anyone
about Lily.

31:23.482 --> 31:26.152
I'm sorry, but we're
officers of the law.

31:26.185 --> 31:31.223
We can't keep this information
from the court.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.459
Initially,
I felt the mother's rights

31:33.492 --> 31:35.995
in this case were being
unfairly eroded,

31:36.028 --> 31:39.531
but the new information we have
about Jennifer's first child

31:39.565 --> 31:43.102
and the significant extra risk
this poses to the fetus

31:43.135 --> 31:44.670
has made me change my mind.

31:44.703 --> 31:47.639
Under Article Ten
of the Family Court Act,

31:47.673 --> 31:51.477
I find the fetus is at risk
of derivative neglect.

31:51.510 --> 31:57.016
Jennifer Fulton,
you are to abstain from alcohol

31:57.049 --> 31:58.985
for the duration
of your pregnancy,

31:59.018 --> 32:01.988
and you are to present yourself
in the next 24 hours

32:02.021 --> 32:04.290
for counseling
and out-patient treatment

32:04.323 --> 32:06.458
at an alcohol
rehabilitation center.

32:06.492 --> 32:09.028
( pounds gavel )

32:11.363 --> 32:13.632
JENNIFER:
It's late.
What do you want?

32:13.665 --> 32:14.633
To tell you I'm sorry

32:14.666 --> 32:16.235
that things worked out
like this.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.170
Oh, is that supposed
to make me feel better?

32:18.204 --> 32:19.171
I doubt it will.

32:19.205 --> 32:20.172
I was trying
to help you.

32:20.206 --> 32:22.174
What, you planning on
running my restaurant

32:22.208 --> 32:23.109
while I'm in rehab?

32:23.142 --> 32:24.710
Jennifer, you're going
to be an out-patient.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.045
You can work out
a schedule.

32:26.078 --> 32:27.213
Oh, you always have

32:27.246 --> 32:29.181
all the answers,
don't you, Olivia?

32:29.215 --> 32:30.482
Are you okay?

32:30.516 --> 32:33.119
Yeah. Couldn't be better.

32:33.152 --> 32:34.186
Jennifer,
are you drinking?

32:34.220 --> 32:36.022
No, give it back!

32:36.055 --> 32:37.423
What is this, rum?

32:37.456 --> 32:40.059
Do you have any idea
what you're doing to yourself?

32:40.092 --> 32:42.461
Yeah, and I have every right
to do it!

32:42.494 --> 32:43.996
And what about your baby?

32:44.030 --> 32:46.632
You promised me that you'd stop,
and I believed you.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.034
I went to bat for you.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.035
I didn't
ask you to.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.236
Yes, you did.

32:50.269 --> 32:51.237
This is none of

32:51.270 --> 32:52.204
your damn business!
It i my business.

32:52.238 --> 32:54.606
I'm a cop, and
you're violating
a court order.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.574
Oh, get over yourself.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.676
I'd like to see you
handle being pregnant!

32:57.709 --> 32:59.311
Jennifer Fulton,
you're under arrest

32:59.345 --> 33:00.512
for criminal contempt
of court.

33:00.546 --> 33:01.780
No. Olivia, no, please!

33:01.813 --> 33:03.249
You have the right
to remain silent.

33:03.282 --> 33:04.516
Anything you say
can and will be held...

33:04.550 --> 33:06.318
No, please, don't do
this to me, please!

33:10.689 --> 33:12.224
Congratulations.
You've got your cops

33:12.258 --> 33:13.125
hauling pregnant women out

33:13.159 --> 33:14.760
of their homes
in the middle of the night.

33:14.793 --> 33:17.096
Detective Benson showed
a concern for Mrs. Fulton

33:17.129 --> 33:18.364
above and beyond the call
of duty.

33:18.397 --> 33:19.531
JENNIFER:
I am sitting here

33:19.565 --> 33:21.033
because of her concern for me?

33:21.067 --> 33:22.134
Look, we're not
here to fight.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.236
I came to offer a deal.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.238
What kind of deal?

33:26.272 --> 33:27.539
If Jennifer pleads guilty,

33:27.573 --> 33:29.541
I'll ask for a suspended
sentence pending

33:29.575 --> 33:31.310
the successful
completion of
her pregnancy

33:31.343 --> 33:32.744
in an alcohol
treatment facility.

33:32.778 --> 33:33.745
SCARRY:
In other words,

33:33.779 --> 33:35.081
she's not going to court,

33:35.114 --> 33:36.282
but you're going
to lock her up anyway.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.050
It's a residential facility.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.218
It's not a prison.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.819
You're depriving her
of her liberty.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.522
And sending a message
to every troubled pregnant woman

33:43.555 --> 33:46.425
that she should avoid doctors,
hospitals, health workers,

33:46.458 --> 33:47.759
and above all, the police,

33:47.793 --> 33:49.461
or she, too, might end up
in jail.

33:49.495 --> 33:52.131
That's a ludicrous exaggeration.

33:52.164 --> 33:53.732
Not from where my client
is sitting.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.067
Jennifer, we're trying to do

33:55.101 --> 33:56.268
what's best for you
and your baby.

33:56.302 --> 33:57.603
You're going to have
to trust us.

33:57.636 --> 34:00.172
I did trust you, Olivia.

34:00.206 --> 34:02.608
The best way out of this
is to take the deal.

34:02.641 --> 34:03.609
No.

34:03.642 --> 34:07.213
I'm not taking any more advice
from you or her.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.248
I want my day in court.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.553
SCARRY:
Jennifer,

34:14.586 --> 34:16.222
how did you end up here
in this court?

34:16.255 --> 34:18.257
Your Honor,
what's the relevance?

34:18.290 --> 34:20.592
Get to where
you're going,
Ms. Scarry.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.194
I believe it all started

34:22.228 --> 34:25.131
because your husband attempted
to rape you?

34:25.164 --> 34:26.232
Yes.

34:26.265 --> 34:29.135
And then he joined forces
with an anti-abortion group

34:29.168 --> 34:30.269
and took you to court?

34:30.302 --> 34:33.339
They wanted to stop me
from terminating my pregnancy.

34:33.372 --> 34:36.675
I realized I
wanted a child,

34:36.708 --> 34:40.346
and that I was incredibly lucky
to have the chance to have one.

34:40.379 --> 34:42.748
But after you agreed

34:42.781 --> 34:46.252
to your husband's request
not to terminate the pregnancy,

34:46.285 --> 34:48.254
he took you to court again,

34:48.287 --> 34:50.756
this time alleging
you were an unfit mother.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.858
Yes.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.560
Because of my drinking.

34:54.593 --> 34:55.761
So,

34:55.794 --> 34:57.129
these last few weeks

34:57.163 --> 34:59.198
of your life include
an attempted rape,

34:59.231 --> 35:02.201
multiple court appearances,
and now you're on trial

35:02.234 --> 35:04.770
after having been arrested
in your own home.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.738
Jennifer, if you had not
been subjected

35:06.772 --> 35:09.508
to this level of harassment,
would you need to drink?

35:09.541 --> 35:10.709
No.

35:10.742 --> 35:11.810
How do you know?

35:11.843 --> 35:13.145
NOVAK:
Objection.

35:13.179 --> 35:14.446
Calls for speculation.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.882
Answer the question,
Mrs. Fulton.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.287
I drink when I'm under stress.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.190
If my husband would
leave me alone,

35:24.223 --> 35:26.392
I wouldn't need alcohol.

35:26.425 --> 35:30.796
And will do everything you can
to ensure your child is healthy?

35:30.829 --> 35:33.332
Yes. I will.

35:38.937 --> 35:41.173
NOVAK:
Jennifer,

35:41.207 --> 35:42.040
do you believe

35:42.073 --> 35:44.310
you can control
your alcohol addiction?

35:44.343 --> 35:46.312
Yes, I do.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.314
You weren't able to go 24 hours

35:48.347 --> 35:50.316
without breaking
the Family Court's ruling.

35:50.349 --> 35:51.450
I was under a lot

35:51.483 --> 35:52.451
of stress.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.452
You're pregnant.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.453
That stress isn't

35:54.486 --> 35:55.821
going to go away.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.356
Can you guarantee

35:57.389 --> 35:59.191
that you won't have
another lapse?

35:59.225 --> 36:00.326
Yes.

36:00.359 --> 36:01.727
How?

36:01.760 --> 36:02.761
Alcoholism is a disease.

36:02.794 --> 36:05.197
It's not something
that can be switched on and off.

36:05.231 --> 36:06.198
JENNIFER:
I know

36:06.232 --> 36:07.466
I can control it.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.700
How can you, Jennifer?

36:08.734 --> 36:10.802
Because I love my baby.

36:10.836 --> 36:13.905
I'm not going to hurt it.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.774
You say that,
but you still drank.

36:15.807 --> 36:18.544
I'm telling you,
I love my child.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.612
I do!

36:26.818 --> 36:28.787
SCARRY:
The People's argument

36:28.820 --> 36:30.356
makes perfect sense.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.658
If the mother
has a drinking problem,

36:32.691 --> 36:34.360
why not give her treatment

36:34.393 --> 36:37.296
so her behavior doesn't harm
her unborn child?

36:37.329 --> 36:39.865
Everything in me
as a wife and a mother agrees

36:39.898 --> 36:43.469
with the urge
to protect the fetus.

36:43.502 --> 36:48.407
Then why does this Family Court
order make me so afraid?

36:48.440 --> 36:50.542
Because if you follow
the Court's line of thinking

36:50.576 --> 36:52.378
to its inevitable conclusion,

36:52.411 --> 36:55.247
then every pregnant woman
could be monitored

36:55.281 --> 36:56.214
by the State.

36:56.248 --> 36:59.585
Today, it's alcohol,
but what's next, driving?

36:59.618 --> 37:01.520
She could get into an accident.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.356
Prescription meds--
all those side effects.

37:04.390 --> 37:06.358
Dieting-- the baby might suffer.

37:06.392 --> 37:08.627
In fact, why not prohibit
every activity

37:08.660 --> 37:10.296
which could harm the fetus?

37:10.329 --> 37:12.298
If you give the fetus rights

37:12.331 --> 37:15.267
to the extent
the Family Court demands,

37:15.301 --> 37:16.968
then all you women
here must be prepared

37:17.002 --> 37:18.337
to lose your
own rights.

37:18.370 --> 37:19.471
And where
will it end?

37:19.505 --> 37:23.975
With you as nothing more
than child-bearing receptacles

37:24.009 --> 37:26.278
with no right to privacy

37:26.312 --> 37:29.381
and no right
to control your own bodies.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.554
Jennifer Fulton is here

37:35.587 --> 37:38.657
because she ignored
a court order not to drink.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.992
Now, she's promised not
to drink again

37:41.026 --> 37:43.329
and to attend
an out-patient facility.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.731
But she's broken
these promises before.

37:45.764 --> 37:49.368
So, how can she guarantee
that she won't break them again?

37:49.401 --> 37:51.437
She can't.

37:51.470 --> 37:55.441
Now, you've been asked
to consider the mother's rights,

37:55.474 --> 37:58.577
but don't forget
about the rights of the child,

37:58.610 --> 38:00.946
the child Jennifer wants
to have.

38:00.979 --> 38:04.750
Doesn't that child have
the right to be born healthy?

38:04.783 --> 38:07.319
Or must it suffer
its entire life

38:07.353 --> 38:09.755
just to uphold
the mother's right to do

38:09.788 --> 38:11.957
whatever she wants
with her body?

38:11.990 --> 38:13.959
Now, you know

38:13.992 --> 38:16.462
Jennifer can't help herself,
so I'm asking you to help her

38:16.495 --> 38:18.497
by finding her guilty.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.366
Yes, she will be locked up,

38:20.399 --> 38:22.368
but she will also be given,
at State expense,

38:22.401 --> 38:24.370
the treatment that she needs

38:24.403 --> 38:27.773
to ensure the safe delivery
of her baby.

38:27.806 --> 38:31.377
Well, isn't that
what everyone here wants?

38:43.655 --> 38:45.757
Ladies and gentlemen

38:45.791 --> 38:47.993
of the jury, have
you reached a verdict?

38:48.026 --> 38:49.361
We have, Your Honor.

38:49.395 --> 38:50.596
On the charge
of criminal contempt

38:50.629 --> 38:52.364
of court, how do you find?

38:52.398 --> 38:53.565
We find

38:53.599 --> 38:55.367
the defendant not guilty.

38:55.401 --> 38:57.436
( murmuring )

38:58.437 --> 39:00.872
( bangs gavel )

39:00.906 --> 39:03.609
JUDGE SELIGMAN:
Mrs. Fulton,

39:03.642 --> 39:05.010
I'm sure you
understand

39:05.043 --> 39:07.446
the Family Court
ruling still applies.

39:07.479 --> 39:10.582
You will present yourself
for treatment tomorrow morning,

39:10.616 --> 39:12.951
or you will find yourself
in court again.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.453
This court
is adjourned.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.855
( bangs gavel )

39:39.445 --> 39:41.513
Whatcha doing?

39:43.815 --> 39:46.051
I came to see my daughter.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.456
How did you know
I was here?

39:50.489 --> 39:51.356
Lily's dad called me.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.559
He said that a woman
was outside his house

39:53.592 --> 39:55.561
for hours, watching.

39:55.594 --> 39:58.497
I knew it was you.

39:59.531 --> 40:01.500
They didn't find me guilty
in court

40:01.533 --> 40:03.502
'cause they didn't want
to lock me up.

40:06.972 --> 40:09.407
But I am guilty.

40:13.011 --> 40:16.081
What if I've damaged this baby,
too?

40:17.215 --> 40:19.485
What if she's like Lily?

40:19.518 --> 40:21.987
Why don't you talk to Lily?

40:23.622 --> 40:25.591
I can't.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.826
That's why you
came, isn't it?

40:29.828 --> 40:33.164
Jennifer,
it's okay.

40:33.198 --> 40:36.067
I told them who you are.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.570
And they said to come over.

40:44.142 --> 40:46.612
Talk

40:46.645 --> 40:49.047
to Lily.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.717
Come on.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.899
I'll wait for you.
