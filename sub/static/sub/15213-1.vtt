02:14.834 --> 02:15.960
Champagne?

02:19.539 --> 02:20.836
Champagne?

02:26.779 --> 02:30.007
Sorry.
Bubbles went up my nose.

02:32.785 --> 02:35.310
Actually that's not technically
champagne, that's cava.

02:35.421 --> 02:36.854
It's a Spanish sparkling wine

02:36.956 --> 02:42.121
that uses the Champenois process that...
Never mind.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.126
<i>- Is it there?</i>
- One porcelain vase.

02:48.234 --> 02:52.034
Early Ming Dynasty, circa 1400, lot 011.

02:52.138 --> 02:54.902
Lot 011.

02:55.975 --> 02:57.272
And Mason?

02:57.510 --> 03:01.810
He's here and he brought a friend.
A very big friend.

03:02.582 --> 03:06.348
Whatever it takes,
do not let him leave with that vase.

03:06.452 --> 03:09.580
- Check. Save the world no matter what.
- As long as you don't go over budget.

03:09.689 --> 03:13.648
Next up, ladies and gentlemen,
a porcelain vase.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.287
Early Ming Dynasty, circa 1400.

03:17.397 --> 03:20.958
May I hear a starting bid of £20,000?

03:21.901 --> 03:25.064
20,000. Do I hear 30,000?

03:25.171 --> 03:28.231
30,000. Thank you, sir. 30,000 is the bid.

03:28.341 --> 03:31.708
Do I hear 40? Looking for 40.
40,000 to the lady.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.439
- I have 40,000.
- 30,000's in the budget.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.574
- I'm officially upset now, Flynn.
- 40,000 is standing...

03:38.685 --> 03:41.848
Hey, Katie. Everything okay?

03:41.955 --> 03:45.356
We were supposed to meet for lunch
an hour ago. Where are you?

03:45.458 --> 03:48.518
I'm still at the...

03:48.628 --> 03:49.720
<i>Flynn!</i>

03:50.396 --> 03:53.524
I'm at the librarian convention.
The online catalog seminar ran over,

03:53.633 --> 03:56.363
you know how it is when you get
a bunch of librarians in a room talking.

03:56.469 --> 04:00.963
In the last six months that we've been
dating you've given a hundred excuses.

04:01.074 --> 04:05.602
- Come on, a hundred?
- Verbal bid, £100,000.

04:06.112 --> 04:09.047
- Do I have 150? 150?
<i>- You're always late.</i>

04:09.148 --> 04:10.638
<i>- £150,000.</i>
- Slow down.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.814
- I have 150. 150, looking for 200.
<i>- Or running off to some convention</i>

04:13.920 --> 04:15.785
<i>- or book club retreat.</i>
- I brought you to England.

04:15.888 --> 04:20.483
And since we've gotten off the plane,
you've left me waiting a dozen times.

04:20.593 --> 04:23.619
- I have to take that.
- Don't you take that call.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.960
Are you trying to bankrupt us?

04:26.065 --> 04:28.465
I can't really talk to you now, Charlene.
I got Katie on the other line.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.798
- Is Katie writing your checks?
- Give me five minutes, okay?

04:30.903 --> 04:33.030
- Don't you hang up.
- Just give me five minutes.

04:33.139 --> 04:35.471
I have £500,000.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.736
<i>- Flynn? Flynn?</i>
- Wait. What, what, what?

04:37.877 --> 04:41.278
- 500,000. 550. 600.
- Oh, no.

04:41.381 --> 04:44.782
Maybe some women are okay with the
wild and unpredictable lifestyle

04:44.884 --> 04:49.548
- of dating a librarian, but I'm not.
- 600. 650.

04:49.656 --> 04:55.185
750. 850! I have 850!
850,000 is the standing bid.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.388
<i>I want someone I can depend on!</i>

04:57.497 --> 04:59.692
No, no, no!

04:59.899 --> 05:00.866
850!

05:00.967 --> 05:03.162
- I'm leaving.
- No, don't leave.

05:03.269 --> 05:07.035
I'll meet you in 15 minutes in the hotel bar.
15 minutes in the hotel bar. Don't leave.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.801
Please don't let me down again, Flynn.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.502
- Do I have more?
- £1 million!

05:21.187 --> 05:25.123
Sold to the impatient American
for £1 million.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.073
Charlene?

05:46.079 --> 05:49.674
And let's wait about two weeks
before cashing that check, shall we?

05:49.782 --> 05:54.845
Yes. Such a pleasure to find someone who
understands the unique value and rarity

05:54.954 --> 06:00.051
- of such a fine artifact.
- What are... What are you...

06:01.127 --> 06:02.560
What is that?

06:03.429 --> 06:06.330
That is the philosopher's stone.

06:06.432 --> 06:10.664
The most powerful and famous
transmutational relic in all of history.

06:11.671 --> 06:12.729
What does that mean?

06:12.839 --> 06:16.673
It means that the stone can turn
anything it touches into gold.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.571
Mr. Carson, we meet again.

06:20.680 --> 06:25.515
Very valuable, as you can imagine. But also
quite dangerous if you're not careful.

06:26.285 --> 06:31.120
My bodyguard, Mr. Percy, once
had the misfortune of holding the stone

06:31.224 --> 06:33.351
without taking the necessary precautions.

06:33.459 --> 06:38.123
Well, gentlemen, this is all very fascinating.
But my girlfriend is waiting...

06:40.166 --> 06:42.566
I don't mean to be heavy handed.

06:44.871 --> 06:48.864
Get it? Because his hand is made of gold.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.053
Carson!

07:04.991 --> 07:06.652
I want that stone!

07:13.566 --> 07:16.057
- That's 18th-century Korean.
- Sorry.

07:19.839 --> 07:21.238
Out of the way.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.207
Move, you fool. Move. Move.

07:32.952 --> 07:36.285
A British cavalry sword. Worthey and Sons.
Silver filigree.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.016
A bit overpriced.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.991
- This is rented!
- Of course it is.

08:04.283 --> 08:07.582
- You know you're going to lose, Flynn.
- Actually I know two things.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.281
Your sword grip and tactics show me
that you're fighting

08:10.389 --> 08:14.792
with a German 14th-century sword style
developed by Johannes Lichtenauer.

08:15.228 --> 08:19.392
Defeated only by the Renaissance technique
taught by Hutton in 1892.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.091
What's the other thing you know?

08:21.200 --> 08:24.260
The Renaissance style taught by Hutton
in 1892.

08:33.145 --> 08:38.082
Katie, I'm here. I know... Excuse me,
<i>sorry...l'm</i> a little late. I'm a lot late.

08:40.318 --> 08:45.256
Hi, I'm looking for my girlfriend.
She has blond hair, and she's American.

08:45.591 --> 08:47.559
Would she have had a lingering air
of disappointment?

08:47.660 --> 08:50.993
As if she just made a difficult
but necessary decision?

08:51.097 --> 08:53.827
Yeah. Yeah. That's her.

08:54.133 --> 08:57.830
She left for the airport half an hour ago.
This is for you.

09:25.965 --> 09:26.932
For Russia

09:27.700 --> 09:28.598
For Russia

09:53.960 --> 09:55.985
We've found him!

10:13.012 --> 10:16.413
No, no, no, no, I understand
he wrote you the check,

10:16.515 --> 10:19.484
but he was not authorized for that amount.

10:20.052 --> 10:24.045
Well, perhaps if we returned the...

10:24.924 --> 10:26.516
How many pieces?

10:28.027 --> 10:31.656
We have some very cutting-edge glue
here at the library...

10:33.199 --> 10:34.689
I'll call you back.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.994
Flynn!

10:39.305 --> 10:41.671
- £1 million?
- Please, Charlene, not today.

10:41.774 --> 10:43.799
- I'm not in the mood.
- Fine.

10:43.909 --> 10:46.639
I'll just deduct it from your pay
for the next 50 years.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.179
Did the auctioneer happen to mention
that I gave him

10:48.280 --> 10:51.306
a solid-gold throw pillow worth about
£2 million?

10:51.417 --> 10:53.851
- No.
- Well, here.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.715
Rub a quarter on the philosopher's stone
and you get instant gold.

10:59.558 --> 11:04.222
What has gotten into you?
We just do not profit from the artifacts.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.493
- And this tuxedo, it's a rental.
- Good morning, sir.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.829
John, Chris. Not today, Charlene.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.980
- Where's Judson?
- He's in the Large Collections Annex.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.989
We have a Large Collections Annex?

11:42.034 --> 11:46.198
- Charlene, how big is the library?
- As big as we need it to be.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.914
- Noah's Ark?
- Flynn.

11:59.618 --> 12:00.744
Flynn!

12:02.722 --> 12:04.246
Welcome back, Flynn.

12:06.325 --> 12:09.385
Listen, Judson, I need... Judson?

12:10.496 --> 12:13.659
- Judson?
- It's the Fountain of Youth.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.797
It just arrived from St. Augustine, Florida.

12:18.070 --> 12:21.335
I'm just testing it to make sure
it's the real deal.

12:21.607 --> 12:25.373
That's better.
I'd hate to go through puberty again.

12:26.912 --> 12:30.678
- So, did you find the philosopher's stone?
- Yeah.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.813
- Here you go.
- Ask him how much it cost.

12:33.919 --> 12:37.150
Excellent work.
Well, I knew you'd come through for us.

12:37.256 --> 12:40.885
That's why I know we can count on you
for this next job.

12:40.993 --> 12:44.292
Next job? I just got back.

12:44.396 --> 12:48.526
We've just received the Voinage manuscript
from Yale. It's on loan.

12:48.634 --> 12:50.966
It has to be deciphered by morning.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.766
- Well, I need to leave early today.
- Not today.

12:53.873 --> 12:56.535
Yes, today, because my personal life...

12:57.443 --> 13:01.402
That's right. I forgot, Monday is
your training day with Excalibur.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.139
He missed you.

13:05.251 --> 13:08.846
Well, I've already had my sword
practice for the week, so...

13:08.954 --> 13:10.546
Yeah, you're probably going to have
to spend the night.

13:10.656 --> 13:14.615
- So we have a cot.
- Stop it. All of you.

13:16.562 --> 13:20.589
- Flynn, Flynn, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. No, I'm good.

13:20.699 --> 13:25.033
What could possibly be wrong? I mean,
I work in a basement doing a secret job

13:25.137 --> 13:29.198
I can't even tell my mother about,
and my best friend is a sword!

13:29.508 --> 13:31.772
What could possibly be wrong?

13:31.877 --> 13:36.940
- I think he's snapped.
- Flynn, you're scaring the relics.

13:37.049 --> 13:41.349
This place is sucking the life out of me.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.646
I look around,
I don't even see relics anymore.

13:44.757 --> 13:49.353
You know what I see? I see the parts
of my life that I have given up finding them!

13:50.296 --> 13:55.893
Blackbeard's chest, my mom's 65th birthday.
Da Vinci's diary, my 10-year college reunion.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.902
Do you even know how often
those come along?

14:01.740 --> 14:02.968
Ten years?

14:04.944 --> 14:09.711
Valentine's Day with my...
With my ex-girlfriend.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.142
- The girlfriend.
- It's always about the girl.

14:16.722 --> 14:20.556
Do you know that since I've been working
here I have not been in a relationship

14:20.659 --> 14:23.651
with a woman that has lasted
more than six months.

14:23.762 --> 14:27.664
Didn't work out with Emily, didn't work out
with Nicole, and now Katie dumps me.

14:27.766 --> 14:30.257
And I really thought that she was...

14:32.605 --> 14:34.505
I thought that she might be the one.

14:34.607 --> 14:40.910
Flynn, I'm sorry, but the librarian,
it isn't just a job.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.206
It's your life.

14:44.049 --> 14:48.349
Librarians and relationships...
Look, maybe this will help.

14:50.222 --> 14:54.318
Just think of yourself as a celibate monk.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.119
We do.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.131
Sounds good. Good pep talk.

15:01.400 --> 15:05.700
Are you insane? I am 33 years old!

15:06.639 --> 15:10.097
Celibate monk? Celibate monk? Excalibur.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.773
Do it, do it now, just get it over with.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.247
Flynn, look, you're overworked.

15:18.350 --> 15:22.343
Maybe you should take some time off.

15:22.821 --> 15:26.313
You have some vacation pay coming.
But don't get greedy.

15:32.665 --> 15:33.927
Vacation?

15:36.101 --> 15:37.500
Vacation?

15:40.472 --> 15:43.032
Yeah, okay.

15:45.377 --> 15:46.742
Vacation.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.016
- Do you think he'll come back?
- He'll come back to you.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.316
The library has plans for him.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.790
Prince Vlad Dracul.

16:00.893 --> 16:04.624
This is his insignia, Order of the Dragon.

16:05.965 --> 16:11.699
Vlad was Prince of Wallachia
in the 15th century.

16:11.870 --> 16:14.236
He was noted for his cruelty.

16:14.340 --> 16:19.744
Over 40,000 people were tortured and
murdered during his brief six-year reign.

16:20.045 --> 16:25.176
His favorite method of execution was
impalement on a six-foot stake.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.915
Hence he earned
the nickname Vlad the Impaler.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.819
Was Dracul a vampire, professor?

16:32.691 --> 16:36.787
Vampire? No, I don't think so.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.061
No.

16:39.164 --> 16:43.533
No, the blood lust fed the rumors
from his enemies,

16:43.635 --> 16:50.063
and also his name is Dracula, meaning,
"Son of the Dragon," "Son of the Devil."

16:50.876 --> 16:55.472
But no, he's a moldering corpse somewhere
in those mountains, I'm sure.

16:56.582 --> 16:59.380
A skeleton, like any other.

16:59.485 --> 17:01.646
Well, that's all the time we have
for this evening.

17:01.754 --> 17:06.020
We will see you this time next week.
For now, be young.

17:15.867 --> 17:20.271
I enjoy lecture, professor. Very informative.

17:23.308 --> 17:27.074
Two thousand years of Romanian history,
all they want to know about is the vampires.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.738
<i>Dracula</i> always was bestseller.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.281
Where do I know your face?

17:34.386 --> 17:37.787
My work has attracted a lot of
attention lately.

17:38.457 --> 17:39.617
Kubichek.

17:39.725 --> 17:44.162
You recently resigned as Security Minister
from the Russian government.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.597
Not as much fun as your old days
in the KGB, I suppose.

17:47.699 --> 17:52.398
Haven't you heard, there's no more KGB?
There's no more Russia, really.

17:53.839 --> 17:57.832
That government is a sham.
I'm going to do something about that.

17:57.943 --> 18:00.605
We are going to do something about that.

18:00.879 --> 18:04.144
- What do you need from me?
- He wasn't in Snagov.

18:04.616 --> 18:07.949
We found him much further south
in the Carpathians.

18:08.053 --> 18:09.748
You found the body?

18:13.358 --> 18:17.055
I remembered we had two scrolls we
had taken from Nazis

18:17.162 --> 18:20.825
who had in turn stolen them from a
monastery in the South of France,

18:20.933 --> 18:23.458
so I went into old files and found them.

18:24.303 --> 18:28.330
This one is map to Dracul's body.

18:29.708 --> 18:33.872
And this one provides clues
to where the French monks hid this.

18:35.280 --> 18:39.910
No, no. This is a hoax.
I've searched for this my entire life.

18:40.652 --> 18:43.883
It's real. And you're going to help us find it.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.552
The Judas Chalice.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.060
Flynn, open up. It's Charlene.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.669
What are you doing here?

19:05.777 --> 19:10.840
My combination speed dating,
wine tasting was two streets down.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.075
How did that go?

19:13.452 --> 19:14.510
Here.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.890
This is how you spend your free time?
Cooped up in your apartment?

19:19.992 --> 19:22.688
Yeah, just catching up on some reading.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.654
Yeah, you of all people don't read enough.

19:26.765 --> 19:32.726
I've also discovered this new online
poker game, which is really amazing.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.897
By using binomial coefficients
and probability theories

19:35.007 --> 19:37.874
I've been able to correctly guess
the cards 73% of the time.

19:37.976 --> 19:41.776
I have won over 25,000 virtual dollars.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.780
I'm virtually proud of you.

19:43.916 --> 19:47.215
You have time off. Get out of this apartment.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.654
I just...

19:50.756 --> 19:52.553
I don't feel like it right now.

19:52.658 --> 19:58.221
Look, these are travel brochures
for vacations I never took.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.298
So don't do what I did.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.867
Here, you could go to the Grand Canyon.

20:02.968 --> 20:06.233
You know, seven people fall
off the Grand Canyon every year.

20:06.338 --> 20:09.432
- Wine tasting in Sonoma.
- Wine goes bad.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.271
Just get out of here, go to Las Vegas.

20:12.377 --> 20:15.608
- New Orleans.
- And what if New Orleans dumps me?

20:15.714 --> 20:18.308
The city of New Orleans will dump you?

20:19.484 --> 20:24.046
I just, I don't want to get my hopes up
about something new

20:24.156 --> 20:28.354
and then be disappointed.
And then lose, again.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.888
Look, I'm sorry about Katie.

20:35.133 --> 20:37.499
But you just can't get stuck,

20:37.603 --> 20:40.834
you've got to move on to new things,
to a new someone.

20:40.939 --> 20:43.134
And when I lose the next someone?

20:43.242 --> 20:46.040
You're not the only one this job has cost.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.710
You know, my marriage broke up
right before we met.

20:49.815 --> 20:54.184
Now, I'm not saying that my time
with Gaston was bad or wasted,

20:54.286 --> 20:58.552
but sometimes saying goodbye
is the right thing to do.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.415
Keep on living.

21:02.394 --> 21:05.693
Follow the dream. See where it leads you.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.967
- This old?
- Yeah.

21:13.038 --> 21:15.939
You're not driving, are you?

21:16.041 --> 21:17.770
No, I got the bike.

21:37.429 --> 21:41.092
<i>I see the sadness in your eyes</i>

21:41.199 --> 21:43.759
<i>Is more than you let on</i>

21:43.869 --> 21:46.497
<i>They ask where love has gone</i>

21:46.605 --> 21:48.539
Come to me, Flynn.

21:49.408 --> 21:53.003
Find me. Come to me, Flynn.

22:32.217 --> 22:33.707
Follow a dream.

22:42.294 --> 22:45.354
All aboard. All aboard.

22:49.067 --> 22:52.093
And I got my cab right out front,
and my cousin Budro,

22:52.204 --> 22:54.832
he got a hotel
and I could give you a cut rate...

22:54.940 --> 22:56.134
Little help here.

22:56.241 --> 22:59.506
- Hey, welcome to The Big Easy.
- Thank you very much.

22:59.644 --> 23:01.544
Let <i>les bons temps rouler.</i>

23:01.646 --> 23:03.978
Let the good times roll.

23:04.082 --> 23:07.074
Boy, it is good to have tourists
back in the city.

23:07.185 --> 23:10.154
- I look like a tourist?
- <i>Mon ami,</i> you look like the tourist.

23:10.255 --> 23:12.519
Come on, we'll take my cab.

23:12.624 --> 23:14.888
- You here on business or pleasure?
- Pleasure.

23:15.494 --> 23:18.657
Then you're in luck,
'cause pleasure is my business.

23:20.665 --> 23:24.260
Hey, name's Andre. Number's on the back.

23:24.469 --> 23:27.097
Whatever you need, look no further,
'cause I'm your man.

23:27.205 --> 23:28.866
Well, thank you.

23:28.974 --> 23:30.874
You want some good old Creole cooking?

23:30.976 --> 23:34.139
My cousin Joe got
the best restaurant in the city.

23:35.514 --> 23:36.481
Night life?

23:36.581 --> 23:39.311
You can't beat my cousin Duke's
free jazz cafe.

23:39.418 --> 23:44.378
Fishing? My cousin Earl got
the luckiest boat on the river.

23:44.489 --> 23:45.922
How many cousins do you have?

23:46.024 --> 23:48.151
How many you need?

23:48.260 --> 23:49.784
So, what is it?

23:50.595 --> 23:54.361
Music? Booze? Food? Women?

23:54.466 --> 23:57.094
I thought I'd check out a few museums.

23:59.638 --> 24:01.970
The museums. Sure.

24:04.309 --> 24:07.244
You do realize you're in New Orleans, right?

24:58.096 --> 25:00.326
This city is so romantic.

25:03.635 --> 25:09.733
<i>I see the sadness in your eyes</i>
<i>is more than you let on</i>

25:09.841 --> 25:13.072
<i>They ask where love has gone</i>

25:15.013 --> 25:18.312
<i>Was it some magic or a twist?</i>

25:18.416 --> 25:21.214
<i>A spell that crossed the stars?</i>

25:21.319 --> 25:24.049
<i>Whatever happened here we are</i>

25:34.032 --> 25:39.470
<i>To lie with you under a hundred moons</i>

25:40.539 --> 25:44.407
<i>Memories that time could not erase</i>

25:46.177 --> 25:50.443
<i>I'd give it all to feel the sun again</i>

25:51.683 --> 25:55.517
<i>And let it warm my face</i>

25:58.723 --> 26:02.989
<i>To love and lose and love again</i>

26:03.094 --> 26:07.656
<i>as sure as planets turn</i>

26:09.234 --> 26:13.534
<i>Our faith in love, that's everything</i>

26:19.177 --> 26:24.046
<i>To lose and love only to lose again</i>

26:25.250 --> 26:29.346
<i>It isn't bad if you believe</i>

26:30.622 --> 26:34.991
<i>That now and always you stay in my heart</i>

26:35.994 --> 26:40.158
Mon cher, <i>I could never leave</i>

26:42.467 --> 26:45.868
<i>No, I will never leave</i>

26:47.906 --> 26:51.433
<i>I will never leave you</i>

27:04.789 --> 27:07.314
Are you sure it's in here?

27:07.425 --> 27:11.759
Yes, the scroll specifically says
that the monks assigned a hiding place

27:11.863 --> 27:15.299
somewhere in the old Capuchin Monastery.

27:16.801 --> 27:19.099
They turn church into nightclub.

27:21.439 --> 27:22.770
Americans.

27:23.775 --> 27:25.037
Ivan, go.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.862
Mind if I join you?

27:54.239 --> 27:55.263
Hi.

27:57.075 --> 27:58.372
I'm Flynn.

27:58.476 --> 28:02.242
That performance was... Wow.

28:05.316 --> 28:07.181
Can I buy you a drink?

28:08.386 --> 28:10.081
You already have a drink.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.179
This is going to sound...

28:12.857 --> 28:16.020
It's going to sound like
a bad pickup line but...

28:17.562 --> 28:20.395
You're the woman I've been dreaming about.

28:21.700 --> 28:25.295
You're right, it does sound
like a bad pickup line.

28:26.738 --> 28:28.831
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.464
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

28:30.575 --> 28:32.202
Yeah, I just got out of this relationship

28:32.310 --> 28:33.937
and I came down here
to forget about everything,

28:34.045 --> 28:35.842
and I had this really crazy dream and...

28:35.947 --> 28:38.939
Let's go somewhere a little bit more private.

28:40.585 --> 28:41.950
Yeah, sure.

28:51.796 --> 28:54.663
Are we in a rush?

28:57.001 --> 28:58.366
Come.

29:06.644 --> 29:10.205
This is definitely

29:10.315 --> 29:11.873
a fire hazard.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.778
Hazard.

29:14.719 --> 29:15.811
Hazard.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.218
Hey, it's an echo chamber.

29:18.323 --> 29:20.154
See, that's kind of a specialty
of Eastern temples,

29:20.258 --> 29:22.852
but a lot of Western monasteries use
the same architectural design.

29:22.961 --> 29:25.486
You see, stand in the right spot

29:25.597 --> 29:29.033
and a single voice
is amplified into an entire chorus.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.245
Wow, a little fast, huh?

29:42.247 --> 29:45.683
Don't you think we should open some music
or put on some wine?

29:45.784 --> 29:49.049
Or... Take a key from your thigh?

29:49.154 --> 29:53.056
It's okay, librarian. You can drop the act.

29:53.158 --> 29:56.525
You're very convincing
as a hapless loser, by the way.

29:56.628 --> 30:01.224
Librarian? How did you...
What do you mean, "hapless loser"?

30:01.332 --> 30:03.425
No, go back to the librarian part.

30:03.535 --> 30:04.524
You're the librarian.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.298
Yes, but I'm on vacation,
and how do you even know...

30:07.405 --> 30:09.134
I called you in your dreams.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.265
I knew you called me in my dream.
I thought I was going crazy.

30:11.376 --> 30:13.071
The marker will tell you where to go next.

30:13.178 --> 30:14.611
And please hurry, there is little time left,

30:14.712 --> 30:17.203
and a librarian is the only one
who can protect the chalice.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.681
Chalice? What chalice?

30:20.451 --> 30:22.749
You're talking about the Holy Grail?
We already have it.

30:22.854 --> 30:24.754
It's about that big, made out of wood.

30:24.856 --> 30:26.790
- No, no, no.
- Funny story, I'm dusting...

30:26.891 --> 30:28.620
- No, you...
- Drop it.

30:30.128 --> 30:33.188
Kill them both, and bring the marker to me.

30:36.467 --> 30:39.994
First of all, I'm on vacation.

30:40.738 --> 30:42.603
And second of all,

30:42.707 --> 30:46.336
you, and you, and you,

30:47.011 --> 30:50.640
you, you, you, you, you...

30:53.484 --> 30:54.815
I see now.

30:58.923 --> 31:00.185
This way.

31:03.461 --> 31:04.826
After them.

31:06.598 --> 31:07.860
This way.

31:11.669 --> 31:12.727
God!

31:24.315 --> 31:27.478
Okay, don't be nervous.
We're going to have to...

31:31.022 --> 31:33.115
Okay.

31:35.727 --> 31:40.664
160 pounds, 45-degree angle,
15-foot linear distance.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.365
Okay, one, two...

31:46.704 --> 31:47.898
Flynn.

31:48.006 --> 31:50.236
Maybe 165 pounds.

32:02.186 --> 32:03.949
Who are these people?

32:05.056 --> 32:06.751
Would you get back?

32:14.198 --> 32:15.165
Where is it?

32:15.266 --> 32:18.861
There were two thieves here
when we arrived.

32:18.970 --> 32:22.497
They escaped with the marker.

32:22.607 --> 32:27.169
You fail me, you fail me, you fail me!

32:27.278 --> 32:30.736
Perhaps we don't need the marker.

32:46.464 --> 32:51.299
How did you know that I can hit a high C?
Not everyone can, you know.

32:51.402 --> 32:53.563
When you sang
I heard you use glottal stops,

32:53.671 --> 32:55.764
indicative of a classical
opera training technique.

32:55.873 --> 32:58.171
Plus, you're a natural soprano so...

32:58.276 --> 33:01.439
Is that what it's like
in your head all the time?

33:02.213 --> 33:05.740
Pretty much. Except for the screaming
when I'm being shot at.

33:05.850 --> 33:08.410
Or when I'm falling a great distance.

33:10.088 --> 33:11.749
Can you read that?

33:12.223 --> 33:15.192
- You can't?
- No, I am just its guardian.

33:15.293 --> 33:17.557
You guard something
that you don't understand.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.527
So says the librarian.

33:20.231 --> 33:23.758
- Good point. Who helps you?
- No one.

33:23.868 --> 33:27.964
I've been guarding this secret
for most of my life by myself.

33:28.072 --> 33:29.937
That must get lonely.

33:30.041 --> 33:32.236
Again, so says the librarian.

33:33.811 --> 33:35.574
You ever get sick of it?

33:35.680 --> 33:37.477
It's my destiny.

33:37.582 --> 33:39.379
You cannot escape your destiny, Flynn.

33:39.484 --> 33:41.247
No, I was trying to take
a little vacation from it,

33:41.352 --> 33:44.219
- but it didn't seem to work out very well.
- No.

33:44.322 --> 33:47.485
If you fight your destiny
you will be miserable.

33:47.592 --> 33:50.925
You must embrace it
and revel in every moment.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.656
Such as?

33:52.764 --> 33:55.255
- You save the treasure.
- Whatever that is.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.027
- And escape the bad guys.
- Whoever they are.

33:57.135 --> 33:59.660
- And rescue the lady fair.
- I don't know about rescuing lady...

33:59.771 --> 34:02.171
And your heart is beating.

34:05.309 --> 34:07.743
Every nerve in your body is alive.

34:08.813 --> 34:13.147
Who else can live such a life?
Don't hide from it, Flynn. Celebrate it.

34:14.185 --> 34:15.243
Any suggestions?

34:15.353 --> 34:18.014
Well, we could start with a drink.

34:18.121 --> 34:20.556
They're still going to be out there,
with guns.

34:20.658 --> 34:22.956
Well then, maybe we make it two.

34:25.663 --> 34:27.255
I love this city.

35:00.798 --> 35:03.358
I haven't had this much fun in a long time.

35:03.468 --> 35:05.993
You asked for a vacation,
I bring you a vacation.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.231
Next time without
the gunfire and the running.

35:08.339 --> 35:10.204
Still complaining?

35:12.944 --> 35:16.471
Can I... May I ask you a personal question?

35:16.848 --> 35:19.544
Why ruin the night with personal questions?

35:19.650 --> 35:23.142
Because I want to know... No.

35:23.988 --> 35:26.548
I need to know, is there...

35:29.026 --> 35:30.891
Are you with somebody?

35:32.730 --> 35:33.754
No.

35:35.399 --> 35:40.393
There was somebody a long time ago,
but not for many years.

35:41.372 --> 35:42.430
Why?

36:02.894 --> 36:06.057
I hate to say good night, but...

36:06.164 --> 36:08.029
Then why say good night?

36:52.143 --> 36:54.304
- Any sign of them?
- No.

36:54.779 --> 36:55.837
The professor?

36:55.947 --> 37:00.407
He made good translation from wax,
went to bed hours ago.

37:01.285 --> 37:04.345
We'll deal with them
when we cross paths again.

37:05.823 --> 37:08.690
Yorgi, take over for George.

37:28.145 --> 37:29.544
Who's there?

37:41.826 --> 37:43.020
Simone?

38:03.614 --> 38:04.911
A chalice.

38:08.052 --> 38:09.519
What chalice?

38:18.696 --> 38:21.927
- A shave will take that hangover off.
- It shows, huh?

38:22.033 --> 38:24.365
New Orleans badge of honor, son.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.263
<i>I got the blues</i>

38:29.006 --> 38:31.600
Looks like you got them worse, though.

38:32.176 --> 38:33.768
That's a new one.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.746
Welcome, welcome. Come, sit down.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.179
Enjoying New Orleans, Flynn?

38:46.824 --> 38:48.155
What do you know about this?

38:48.259 --> 38:50.955
I have no idea, it's your vacation.

38:52.897 --> 38:54.489
It's early 1800s.

38:54.598 --> 38:56.225
The markings are a mixture of Latin Vulgate,

38:56.334 --> 38:59.531
early Romance with
a spiffy transcription cipher.

38:59.637 --> 39:01.502
What does it say?

39:01.605 --> 39:07.544
"Even into her night the queen of the
Loa guards the cup of the dagger man."

39:07.645 --> 39:09.135
A riddle?

39:09.246 --> 39:10.440
Exactly.

39:13.417 --> 39:17.547
- I haven't cracked the first part yet.
- What about the second half?

39:18.422 --> 39:20.982
Dagger man in Latin is <i>sicarius.</i>

39:21.092 --> 39:23.856
Which is believed to be
the etymology of the name Iscariot,

39:23.961 --> 39:26.156
as in Judas Iscariot.

39:26.263 --> 39:30.563
The cup of the dagger man is,
this is about the Judas Chalice.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.393
You know of it?

39:32.503 --> 39:35.472
The chalice made from
the 30 pieces of silver

39:35.573 --> 39:37.871
given to Judas Iscariot to betray Christ.

39:37.975 --> 39:40.341
What about the rest of the legend?

39:40.444 --> 39:43.277
The power of the chalice
to resurrect a vampire.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.975
Don't say it. It's ridiculous.

39:46.083 --> 39:48.483
You've seen a lot of strange things, Flynn.

39:48.586 --> 39:51.020
Vampires, Judson?

39:51.122 --> 39:53.682
What would the chalice
even have to do with vampires?

39:53.791 --> 39:56.988
Judas Iscariot hanged himself
from a tree after the betrayal.

39:57.094 --> 40:00.222
Cursed by God to wander the land forever.

40:00.331 --> 40:01.958
The first vampire.

40:04.335 --> 40:05.893
You buy that?

40:06.003 --> 40:09.495
Well, that would explain
a vampire's aversion to silver.

40:09.607 --> 40:11.802
You know, due to the original 30 coins.

40:11.909 --> 40:15.003
Their hatred of the cross. Holy water.

40:15.112 --> 40:17.512
- And the wooden stake?
- And not just any wood.

40:17.615 --> 40:21.813
The stake of aspen,
the tree from which Judas hanged himself.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.581
The only way to kill a true vampire.

40:24.722 --> 40:27.589
So the power of the chalice
to resurrect dead vampires

40:27.691 --> 40:31.855
and to bestow upon a living vampire
ultimate strength and speed, that's real?

40:31.962 --> 40:34.157
That's a very good question.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.893
Another good question is,

40:37.001 --> 40:41.461
why would someone dig up
the grave of Vlad Dracul?

40:41.572 --> 40:42.732
Dracula?

40:42.840 --> 40:47.174
Yes, they raided his tomb
and his coffin was stolen.

40:47.278 --> 40:50.805
Okay, so somebody's looking for a chalice
that resurrects dead vampires

40:50.915 --> 40:54.214
at the same time
that Dracula's body's gone missing?

40:56.587 --> 40:58.179
That's not good.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.954
Judson!

41:07.665 --> 41:11.863
The chalice was hidden
by French monks in the 15th century.

41:11.969 --> 41:15.530
Then later they moved it as far away
from Romania as they could.

41:15.639 --> 41:18.665
Across the ocean? Of course,
'cause New Orleans was a French territory.

41:18.776 --> 41:21.301
So the chalice, the chalice is here.

41:22.279 --> 41:26.943
All right, I got to ask you,
last night I met a girl.

41:27.651 --> 41:29.915
And somehow she knew
that I was the librarian,

41:30.020 --> 41:33.922
and I just have to ask you straight out,
did you send her?

41:34.024 --> 41:35.184
Judson.

41:37.027 --> 41:38.221
Judson!

42:01.118 --> 42:05.214
We got to get in and out before sunset.
They lock this thing up tight at night.

42:05.322 --> 42:06.812
You sure this is the right cemetery?

42:06.924 --> 42:08.516
A lot of conflicting opinions.
Maybe she was buried...

42:08.626 --> 42:12.926
Mr. Professor Museum Man,
you want to see Marie Laveau's tomb,

42:13.030 --> 42:14.361
I'll take you.

42:17.768 --> 42:20.862
I just didn't think you was
the mumbo-jumbo kind, though.

42:20.971 --> 42:22.165
You don't believe in Voodoo?

42:22.273 --> 42:25.970
Why? I'm a black man living in New Orleans,
why I got to believe in Voodoo?

42:26.076 --> 42:28.874
- I mean, this is the 21st century.
- Sorry.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.774
Why you want to see
Marie Laveau's tomb, anyway?

42:32.883 --> 42:37.377
"Even into her night, the queen of
the Loa..." Loa are Voodoo spirits.

42:37.488 --> 42:40.514
- Agasu, Limba, Simbi...
- Yeah, that's a lot of Loa, huh?

42:40.624 --> 42:43.115
Most influential Voodoo queen
was Marie Laveau.

42:43.227 --> 42:46.321
I have a PhD in comparative religions.

42:46.430 --> 42:47.829
Two, actually.

42:47.932 --> 42:49.797
- Well, "Into the night" could mean...
- "Into her night."

42:49.900 --> 42:51.697
It's a metaphor for death.

42:51.802 --> 42:57.672
See, I think that the monks who made this
hid something in her tomb.

42:57.775 --> 42:59.436
- A clue.
- To what?

42:59.543 --> 43:02.444
To the Judas Chalice.

43:04.348 --> 43:06.748
Guards the cup of the dagger man.

43:08.319 --> 43:09.718
Dagger man.

43:14.224 --> 43:16.249
Hello, Judas.

43:17.461 --> 43:19.122
A slot.

43:19.229 --> 43:23.097
US mint is founded in 1792,
Spanish coins still in circulation,

43:23.200 --> 43:24.531
three-quarter of an inch diameter,

43:24.635 --> 43:28.366
current coin radius comparable size
would be...

43:30.374 --> 43:31.739
You don't have
a silver dollar on you, do you?

43:31.842 --> 43:33.173
Let me see.

43:35.813 --> 43:38.475
- My cousin collects them.
- Sure.

43:41.051 --> 43:43.519
Here's your piece of silver, Judas.

43:47.257 --> 43:49.851
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

43:56.166 --> 43:57.656
What's it say?

43:58.535 --> 44:00.162
I don't know yet.

44:12.016 --> 44:13.881
Hey, Mr. Professor Man.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.981
Mr. Professor Man.

44:28.732 --> 44:32.361
Excuse me, but can I have a
glass of water before we get started?

44:35.773 --> 44:37.331
No, you can't.

44:37.441 --> 44:41.275
Was clue what old man said... Hello.

44:42.112 --> 44:43.739
The clue and more.

44:45.249 --> 44:46.910
Good work.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.352
Flynn Carson, according to badge

44:52.456 --> 44:57.416
you are librarian from
Metropolitan Library of New York.

44:58.128 --> 44:59.220
That's right.

44:59.329 --> 45:02.298
So you are down here
collecting overdue books?

45:03.367 --> 45:06.598
Who do you really work for? FBI? CIA?

45:06.704 --> 45:09.036
Why are you after Judas Chalice?

45:09.139 --> 45:12.006
I already have the Judas Plate,
and the Judas Knife and Fork.

45:12.109 --> 45:14.441
So if I want the complete set...

45:16.380 --> 45:18.746
You don't know who I am.

45:18.849 --> 45:22.080
Sergei Kubichek. Former KGB.

45:22.186 --> 45:25.121
Security Minister in the new Russian
government until six months ago

45:25.222 --> 45:29.181
when you resigned over charges
that you were regressive.

45:30.728 --> 45:35.097
- Democracy not working for you, Sergei?
- Chaos not working for me.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.030
Starvation.

45:37.134 --> 45:40.535
Well, one man can't fix it all.

45:40.637 --> 45:44.095
One man leading army
of unkillable soldiers can.

45:46.710 --> 45:50.202
Who could stand against
an army led by Dracul?

45:51.448 --> 45:55.009
Manned by a hundred, a thousand undead.

45:55.819 --> 45:58.379
He's here. You raided the coffin.

45:58.489 --> 46:00.889
We are going to bring order back to Russia.

46:00.991 --> 46:05.860
We are going to rebuild Russia
to her former glory and beyond.

46:08.732 --> 46:12.862
Actually never actually sat this close
to a psychopath before.

46:12.970 --> 46:14.232
Kill him.

46:16.640 --> 46:17.937
You can't kill me.

46:18.041 --> 46:21.442
That coin has writing on it
over 500 years old.

46:21.545 --> 46:23.604
You meatheads won't be able to decipher it.

46:23.714 --> 46:25.841
I, on the other hand,
have PhDs in cryptology

46:25.949 --> 46:28.110
in every language you can imagine.

46:28.218 --> 46:30.448
Face it, Kubichek, you need me.

46:32.923 --> 46:36.450
You don't put much faith
in my organizational abilities.

46:39.296 --> 46:40.763
Professor Emil Lazlo?

46:40.864 --> 46:43.094
- You've heard of him?
- Of course I've heard of him.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.327
- You're a genius.
- Why, thank you.

46:45.435 --> 46:48.131
I have read every book you've ever written
on Eastern European folklore.

46:48.238 --> 46:49.899
I especially admire the synthesis...

46:50.007 --> 46:53.306
So, if I have Professor Lazlo?

46:54.945 --> 46:58.574
Yes, in that case
killing me is totally an option.

46:58.682 --> 47:01.742
I'm sorry, son, I had no choice.
They forced me.

47:05.789 --> 47:08.781
Make it interesting. Have you...

47:11.428 --> 47:13.362
Men, didn't we bring more men?

47:13.463 --> 47:17.832
Well, George disappeared.
Then Peter and two others.

47:17.935 --> 47:19.061
Drinking maybe.

47:19.169 --> 47:21.729
It's so hard to find good help.

47:27.377 --> 47:31.438
Look, I get this from Voodoo shop.

47:33.283 --> 47:34.910
Datura.

47:35.018 --> 47:39.182
Made from a poisonous weed known
to cause disorientation and hallucination.

47:39.289 --> 47:40.654
Used in Voodoo ceremonies.

47:40.757 --> 47:44.750
You always talk in, like, whole paragraphs.
You ever notice that?

47:45.262 --> 47:46.490
Open up.

47:54.137 --> 47:55.263
Get the car.

47:55.372 --> 48:00.036
Drug kicks in, we'll drive him into the river.
Make it look like an accident.

48:01.111 --> 48:06.208
Okay, Mr. Librarian, what kind of
fancy books will get you out of this one?

48:11.288 --> 48:13.415
Houdini wrote books, too.

48:26.770 --> 48:28.328
- You.
- Flynn Carson.

48:28.438 --> 48:30.736
I got about two minutes
before I'm in a full-blown hallucination,

48:30.841 --> 48:32.240
so we gotta get you out of here.

48:32.342 --> 48:35.573
- I've just deciphered the markings.
- There's no time for...

48:35.679 --> 48:37.544
- You did?
- Yes.

48:37.648 --> 48:40.481
What language is it this time? Is it French?
Aragon?

48:40.584 --> 48:44.577
Languedoc. It makes reference
to the Vinierre Cipher. Here.

48:46.256 --> 48:49.282
- Find numerical transposition.
- Yeah.

48:49.393 --> 48:54.456
"M, E, A, L, I."

48:54.564 --> 48:57.226
- How many combinations?
- There's 10 characters, so it'd be...

48:57.334 --> 48:58.323
Factor of ten.

48:58.435 --> 49:00.198
You divide by four
because of the repeated characters.

49:00.304 --> 49:03.205
- It'd be 907,200.
- 907,200.

49:03.307 --> 49:05.138
- Yeah.
- It's Latin.

49:15.052 --> 49:17.418
What? What? Illuminate what?

49:18.288 --> 49:20.256
- Wait a minute.
- What?

49:20.357 --> 49:22.450
The tarnish on this coin.

49:22.559 --> 49:26.086
Silver oxidizes. It doesn't corrode like this.

49:26.196 --> 49:30.599
I was so preoccupied with the writing,
I never examined the coin itself.

49:33.003 --> 49:35.198
- It's glass.
- Glass.

49:35.672 --> 49:37.367
This isn't a coin.

49:38.075 --> 49:39.474
This is a lens.

49:49.252 --> 49:52.346
Morgus Bay, that's where we need to go.

49:52.456 --> 49:55.357
God, you make one hell of a historian.

49:58.061 --> 50:00.222
Flynn. Flynn.

50:02.332 --> 50:05.028
I'm out of time. We gotta get you going.

50:05.135 --> 50:07.103
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- What? What?

50:07.204 --> 50:08.569
No, no.

50:08.672 --> 50:11.436
- Come on.
- No, no. My legs are too slow.

50:11.541 --> 50:13.008
You go. You go.

50:14.111 --> 50:16.102
Don't let him get away.

50:16.213 --> 50:17.840
- I'm good.
- Do not let him leave the house.

50:17.948 --> 50:20.508
- Good luck.
- Where is the librarian?

50:28.892 --> 50:30.519
Excuse me, please.

50:41.872 --> 50:43.840
Don't let him get away.

50:45.742 --> 50:47.869
Please help me. People are chasing me.

50:47.978 --> 50:50.276
Need a chaser, bro? All right.

50:50.380 --> 50:52.871
No. Excuse me.

51:12.602 --> 51:15.366
Okay. Going away. Get up, Flynn.

51:16.306 --> 51:20.436
You're not going to think yourself
out of this one, book boy.

51:35.992 --> 51:37.459
Where did she come from?

51:37.561 --> 51:39.119
Simone?

51:39.229 --> 51:41.925
I leave you alone for one day.

51:42.032 --> 51:45.695
Now, please go before there is trouble.

51:49.139 --> 51:51.699
Nikolai, shoot this tramp.

51:51.808 --> 51:53.469
With pleasure.

51:59.249 --> 52:00.876
Shoot her.

52:02.619 --> 52:03.847
So sorry.

52:15.699 --> 52:17.394
Flynn!

52:18.902 --> 52:20.369
Simone.

52:21.771 --> 52:23.033
Simone.

52:30.180 --> 52:31.408
Missed.

52:31.515 --> 52:32.709
Didn't.

52:52.035 --> 52:55.664
Simone. Simone. Simone, no.

52:55.772 --> 52:58.536
No. Don't die. Don't die because of me.

52:58.642 --> 53:01.440
No. Simone. Simone.

53:03.213 --> 53:04.373
Simone.

53:27.003 --> 53:28.197
Hello.

53:29.706 --> 53:30.730
Hi.

53:51.628 --> 53:54.722
Good. You're awake. I made you some tea.

53:57.133 --> 53:59.033
But I saw you get shot.

53:59.569 --> 54:01.730
You had no pulse. You were dead.

54:01.838 --> 54:04.170
Yeah, sure, I was already dead.

54:05.075 --> 54:08.067
What do you mean? What do you mean
"dead"? Like undead? Like a vampire?

54:08.178 --> 54:09.372
Afraid so.

54:09.479 --> 54:10.571
Tea?

54:12.415 --> 54:14.110
- That is very hurtful.
- Well, excuse me.

54:14.217 --> 54:16.708
I just woke up in a vampire's lair!

54:18.722 --> 54:20.952
You didn't... You didn't...

54:21.057 --> 54:23.048
I don't kill for food.

54:24.761 --> 54:25.955
See?

54:26.563 --> 54:27.791
Blood.

54:28.832 --> 54:31.062
- Oh, God.
- Check for holes.

54:41.044 --> 54:43.171
Kidding. You're so uptight.

54:48.451 --> 54:51.215
It's early Baroque. About 300 years old.

54:52.789 --> 54:55.986
- In fact, a lot of this stuff is.
- Yes.

54:56.092 --> 54:58.993
Mementos I have collected over the years.

55:00.897 --> 55:03.263
And how old are you?

55:03.366 --> 55:07.097
Americans. To ask a lady such a question.

55:08.705 --> 55:10.673
I am 403 years old.

55:13.009 --> 55:14.533
- Four hundred?
<i>- Oui.</i>

55:14.644 --> 55:16.305
- And three?
- Yes.

55:17.180 --> 55:20.513
Well, you know,
I've dated older women before,

55:20.617 --> 55:23.484
but dead is new for me.

55:24.154 --> 55:26.952
Yeah, so, I thought I knew a lot about
history 'cause I've studied it,

55:27.057 --> 55:31.494
but you, you have actually lived it.

55:32.529 --> 55:33.553
How did you...

55:33.663 --> 55:37.224
I was born in Paris in 1603.

55:38.501 --> 55:41.129
It was a very exciting century.

55:41.237 --> 55:45.037
There was Galileo, Shakespeare, Rembrandt.

55:45.141 --> 55:47.803
It was a suiting time to be alive.

55:47.911 --> 55:50.880
And in Paris, I met Francois.

55:50.980 --> 55:53.471
<i>He was a teacher at the university.</i>

55:54.217 --> 55:57.550
<i>We fell in love, and we were soon engaged.</i>

55:58.288 --> 56:01.257
<i>I always loved music</i>
<i>ever since I was a little girl.</i>

56:01.358 --> 56:05.886
<i>And by the age of 25,</i>
<i>I was an opera singer at the royal court.</i>

56:07.997 --> 56:08.964
Who is there?

56:16.606 --> 56:19.541
<i>It was the best time of my life, until...</i>

56:25.749 --> 56:29.185
I died June 12, 1628.

56:30.220 --> 56:32.313
The vampire passed his curse on to me,

56:32.422 --> 56:37.724
condemning my soul
to walk the night forever, never to rest.

56:39.195 --> 56:41.925
And Francois? And Francois?

56:43.266 --> 56:45.234
I never saw him again.

56:46.102 --> 56:49.094
My destiny took my love away from me.

56:50.740 --> 56:52.970
He did love books very much.

56:55.578 --> 57:02.211
I stayed on in Paris for another 200 years
trying to find the vampire and kill him.

57:02.318 --> 57:05.651
But he vanished.
I learned about the Judas Chalice

57:05.755 --> 57:08.656
and how it could resurrect dead vampires.

57:08.758 --> 57:12.159
With such a power, I knew that the undead
could overwhelm the earth.

57:12.262 --> 57:13.661
You wanted to protect it.

57:13.763 --> 57:16.857
And so I followed the trail to the monastery.

57:19.135 --> 57:21.603
But I couldn't decipher the writing
on the pendant.

57:21.704 --> 57:26.437
So I decided to stay on in New Orleans
and protect at least this part of the puzzle.

57:26.543 --> 57:31.480
Until I saw some man studying a monastery,
and I knew that trouble was coming.

57:34.484 --> 57:37.112
That's why you appeared in my dream.

57:37.787 --> 57:39.846
You were asking for help.

57:39.956 --> 57:41.651
From the librarian.

57:42.425 --> 57:43.983
But how do you know about the library?
See, that...

57:44.093 --> 57:46.323
All vampires know about the library.

57:46.429 --> 57:50.331
You librarians have been around
almost as long as we have.

57:50.433 --> 57:53.061
This is from before the Crusades.

57:53.937 --> 57:57.703
It depicts the library's eternal battle
against evil.

57:58.708 --> 58:02.303
More to your job than just
saving old relics, huh, Flynn?

58:03.546 --> 58:07.107
The symbol on the shield,
that's the Tree of Knowledge.

58:08.718 --> 58:09.980
Who's the knight?

58:10.086 --> 58:14.216
He is known as the scholar.
He is the greatest librarian of them all.

58:14.324 --> 58:18.727
Legend has it, he built the library
and is keeper of all of its secrets.

58:19.762 --> 58:21.627
He's known as Yahuda.

58:21.731 --> 58:23.528
Yahuda?

58:24.334 --> 58:27.303
It's Hebrew. It's the Hebrew name...

58:29.539 --> 58:31.803
The Hebrew name for Judson.

58:35.745 --> 58:39.909
The sunrise is in one hour.
I can't go out during the day.

58:40.016 --> 58:42.746
Simone, I need you to come with me.
I know where the chalice is.

58:42.852 --> 58:44.717
Morgus Bay, about a half a day's drive
from here.

58:44.821 --> 58:48.757
It's too far.
I will never survive the trip in the sunlight.

58:50.226 --> 58:51.818
I know somebody.

58:55.265 --> 58:58.029
Hey, hey, Mr. Professor Man.
This is my cousin Earl.

58:58.134 --> 59:00.227
- Earl.
- Hey.

59:00.336 --> 59:02.304
Hey, you disappeared on me
after the big show.

59:02.405 --> 59:05.465
Sorry, Andre, I met some friends.
This is the luckiest boat in New Orleans?

59:05.575 --> 59:06.872
Well, I never said it was the prettiest.

59:06.976 --> 59:08.409
Simone, Andre. Andre, Simone.

59:08.511 --> 59:10.240
- Cousin Earl.
- Hey.

59:15.351 --> 59:18.218
If that's the friend you met, I forgive you.

59:18.321 --> 59:21.415
Boy, you starting to get
that New Orleans spirit, <i>mon ami.</i>

59:21.524 --> 59:24.789
- How far to Morgus Bay?
- We should get there around nightfall.

59:24.894 --> 59:26.657
But why Morgus?
I mean, it ain't nothing but swamp.

59:26.763 --> 59:29.061
I'm going in the cabin now, Andre.

59:29.165 --> 59:32.157
We don't wanna be disturbed until nightfall.

59:32.669 --> 59:34.569
Okay. I get it.

59:34.671 --> 59:35.968
Okay?

59:37.173 --> 59:38.640
I get it.

59:39.776 --> 59:43.610
<i>Laissez les bons temps rouler,</i> baby.

59:43.713 --> 59:45.305
Cast me off, cuz.

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.668
Now, Morgus is a mile inside the swamp.

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:15.377
Now, the water is too shallow.
You'll have to paddle the rest from here.

01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:16.945
You sure about this?

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:19.173
Leave the light on for us.

01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:55.207
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:58.116
- Are you okay? Okay. Okay.
- Yes, I'm fine.

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:02.714
It's a warning. It's bad gris-gris.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.827
Somebody doesn't want us
to go any farther.

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.431
Is that what I think it is?

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.433
Cover your eyes.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.818
It's <i>The Pride.</i> That's Lafitte's ship.

01:01:34.924 --> 01:01:37.188
You see, Jean Lafitte was
a 19th-century pirate.

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:38.282
Flynn.

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:40.328
We must be near the Bitter Area Swamp.
And he used to use

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:43.160
- this maze of swamps as his headquarters.
- "Maze of swamps as his headquarters."

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:47.327
Flynn, I know. I was here twice when
he was docked in New Orleans. Parties.

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:49.632
So, you knew the pirate, Lafitte?

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:51.764
Lightweight when it came to rum.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:54.809
Not so tough. Passed out in his puffy shirt.

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:59.579
Then I guess you knew him well.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:07.152
If I remember correctly,
these stairs lead to the...

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:09.789
Look out!

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:13.525
Trip wire.

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:16.888
Would you survive that?

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:20.196
Head cut off? As bad as sunlight. I go poof.

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:22.264
Stake through the heart?

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:25.101
Only wood from an aspen tree will work.

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:27.940
- Hey!
- Just asking.

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:32.880
This way?

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:35.212
That leads to Jean's quarters.

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:37.643
You mean his bedroom, don't you?

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.052
Now, now, don't be jealous.

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:00.770
Well, well, well.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.473
The man himself.

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.551
Buried with his treasure.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:13.381
I guess you can take it with you.

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:14.956
Oh, Jean.

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:18.987
That's just nasty.

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:25.924
Combination lock.
It will be opened with the right six letters.

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:28.128
- The clue is in...
- French.

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:36.877
"The faith was breached.
The mark was sealed."

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.507
- "Faith was breached."
- "Mark was sealed."

01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:43.051
And "violation, deception, betrayal."

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.141
Yep, yep, yep.

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:46.551
- Betrayal. Sealed with a...
- With a kiss.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:51.719
You see, Judas signaled the Romans
and sealed Christ's fate with a kiss.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.557
And in French, kiss is...

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:03.467
- Ready?
- Yes.

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:06.298
- Little help.
- Okay.

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:07.808
Thank you.

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:25.820
The Judas Chalice.

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:29.123
The Holy Grail for vampires.

01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:34.468
I thought it would be bigger.
Anti-climactic after all this treasure.

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:39.236
Do you want...

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:41.368
Wow.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.646
This stuff is like catnip for you guys, huh?

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:47.477
You know, I think that we should go now.

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:53.751
It's kind of a shame, really.
Can't take the whole thing back with us.

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:57.553
This would make a wonderful addition
to the Large Collections Annex.

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.787
They could put it right next to Noah's Ark
but perpendicular.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:05.391
<i>Fifteen men on a dead man's chest</i>
<i>Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum</i>

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:08.994
I really must thank you
for finding the chalice for me.

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:11.733
Old man said you did all the work.

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:14.302
Professor.

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:18.773
I've looked for this my whole life, son.
I had to see it.

01:05:22.718 --> 01:05:23.776
You.

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:28.783
No.

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:33.652
Ivan warned me about you.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:36.823
I thought it was all nonsense,
but better safe than sorry.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:39.561
Kubichek, if you hurt her,
I swear I'm gonna...

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:41.034
You'll what?

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:44.263
Take away my library card?

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:52.575
I originally planned to resurrect Vlad
on Russian soil,

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:58.283
but tomorrow we begin with America.
Build up a nice little army.

01:05:58.387 --> 01:06:02.118
You don't know what you're doing.
You're unleashing a monster.

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:06.490
You would know what sort of monster.
How long since you last fed?

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:13.968
Lock them in.
Let them rot together for eternity,

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:17.700
or until hunger gets better of her.

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:37.616
Flynn, are you okay?

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.217
My eye really hurts.

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:42.058
This door's made out of iron,
these walls are six inches of wood,

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:44.928
and it's about 20 hours
till they resurrect Vlad.

01:06:45.034 --> 01:06:47.229
Okay, Simone, do your thing.

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:52.364
I could do that.

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:56.844
I'm sorry, Flynn, okay? I'm too weak.
I haven't fed in over 24 hours.

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:03.216
Okay, well, don't get any ideas. Let's...
You just sit right over here and relax.

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:12.151
I can't believe this.

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:17.790
After centuries trying to protect the chalice,
I failed, and I led them here.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:21.597
Well, technically, I led them here.
And it's not over yet.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:25.765
For a 403-year-old woman,
you sure don't have a lot of patience.

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:31.446
This looks promising.

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:37.819
Newton's third law. I've got an idea.

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:51.326
Potassium nitrate.

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:55.098
Perfect.

01:08:09.318 --> 01:08:12.651
- Flynn, there are no cannon balls.
- We don't need them.

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:13.779
Newton's third law?

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:17.416
Every action has
an equal and opposite reaction.

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:21.326
The explosion should be strong enough
to drag this cannon back

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.523
- and through that door.
- Should?

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:27.500
Well, like about 60 percent of the plans
I come up with,

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:32.233
there is a strong possibility
that it could all go horribly, horribly wrong.

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.741
We could die in the explosion.

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:39.305
Well, I can't die.

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:42.747
Right, I'm the only one
who can die in the explosion.

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:46.087
Glad we clarified that.

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:48.281
Okay, here we go.

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:49.584
Wait.

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:52.390
For luck.

01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:56.425
Here goes nothing.

01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:59.997
Wait, wait, wait.

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:09.332
Yeah, Newton!

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:16.343
Andre.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.484
Andre.

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:30.995
He's been hit from behind.
See if you can go and start the boat.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.225
Andre.

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:35.229
Andre.

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:43.073
Simone. No, no, no. Stop the boat.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:46.113
I'm sorry, Flynn.
But you can't come with me.

01:09:46.948 --> 01:09:50.578
Simone, what are you doing? Simone!

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:55.787
Hey. Your girlfriend stole my cousin's boat.

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:59.720
- I thought you said this boat was lucky.
- It is.

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:01.890
For her.

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:42.631
- My cousin Horace.
- I'm not complaining.

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:59.278
Just talked to Earl, the boat's back
at the dock safe and sound.

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:03.017
Well, look like you got an honest girl there.
For a thief.

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:05.423
- Thanks.
- You need anything else?

01:11:07.496 --> 01:11:09.487
I don't suppose you could help
me find a plantation house

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:11.031
being rented by a bunch of Russians.

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:14.728
Well, there are a lot of plantation houses in
New Orleans. Can you tell me anything else?

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:16.202
No.

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:18.569
I don't really remember much
from my visit there.

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:22.542
What, you've been there already?
Well, what do you need me for?

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:26.013
Look, I know you got the photographic
memory in that head of yours.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:28.083
Look, I got faith in you.

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:30.846
Thanks, Andre.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:33.615
<i>Bonne chance,</i> Professor Man.

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:35.155
Come on, cuz.

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.095
Surprise.

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:58.133
That went better in my head.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.674
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't be here.

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:04.803
Why? So I won't see you steal the chalice?
Become all-powerful?

01:13:04.913 --> 01:13:06.938
- You don't understand.
- I understand.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:10.314
You betrayed me.
You wanted the chalice for yourself,

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:13.149
- and I thought you cared about me...
- I do care...

01:13:13.255 --> 01:13:16.747
Satan, get back. I will use this if I have to.

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:20.053
Flynn.

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:24.291
I left you at the dock because
I was trying to protect you.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.392
Well, we got you again.
Honestly, we're not this good.

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:30.768
You two kind of suck at sneaking around.
Bring them.

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:46.113
Just in time. I am sure Vlad Dracul will be
starved when he is awake.

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:49.315
- You're making a big mistake, Kubichek.
- Let's see.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:50.790
Open coffin.

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:01.527
What's next, old man?

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:06.700
Blood must be spilled into the chalice
and then poured on the corpse

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:08.174
at the stroke of midnight.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:11.542
Let's give Dracul a taste of his dinner.

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:17.441
No. No!

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:31.131
It's working.

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:33.697
It's working!

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:49.673
Rise from the dead, warrior prince!

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:53.577
Rise and do my bidding!

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.798
This can't be!

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:12.038
You crippled fool.

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:16.102
It was all a hoax? I'll kill you!

01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:31.618
Lazlo?

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:37.256
- Lazlo's a vampire?
- I recognized him at the ship.

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.596
He was the one I was trying
to protect you from.

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:40.895
Don't be afraid

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:42.932
<i>The one who made me.</i>

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:01.287
We've gotta get that chalice away from him.

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:13.194
You're looking for your missing men, Ivan?
Sorry, I had to snack on the journey.

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:17.932
- You killed my men, Lazlo?
- Please, call me Vlad.

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:22.136
- If you're Vlad, who's that?
- It's a peasant in the box.

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:28.639
I lived for centuries among you humans
unnoticed, until the cattle got sick.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.843
- Cholera.
- 1829 pandemic?

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:32.750
- Flynn.
- Sorry. Sorry.

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:37.791
I drank infected blood and then
I was trapped in this withering body.

01:16:37.893 --> 01:16:41.158
- Until now.
- You wanted the chalice for a cure.

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.821
To revive your powers.

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:47.095
- Lucky for me, Kubichek found the first clue.
- Not so lucky for Kubichek.

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:48.931
I wouldn't say that.

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:55.041
Now that I have the chalice
I will summon my children

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:59.443
and they will drink and we will
plunge your world into darkness.

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:02.984
Come, child, join us. Drink and be strong.

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:06.881
Simone.

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:08.749
Drink.

01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:12.153
Simone.

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:16.857
Simone.

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:25.404
Never. You destroyed my life.

01:17:26.008 --> 01:17:27.976
Then die with the others.

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:30.470
Feed!

01:17:32.948 --> 01:17:35.746
If you got a plan, book boy,
I'd love to hear it.

01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:37.978
I'll take that. Cover your eyes.

01:17:57.706 --> 01:17:59.401
Locate the chalice!

01:18:06.882 --> 01:18:09.043
I know you're out here, Vlad.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.685
It's no use.

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:18.025
Show yourself.

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:30.727
I think it's only fair to warn you
that I am in fact a librarian.

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:34.438
I've fought evil in many forms.

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:38.243
Approximately 35 forms.

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:40.780
Give or take.

01:18:41.683 --> 01:18:44.277
So you have every reason to be afraid.

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:49.620
Is that supposed to frighten me?

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.354
'Cause mission accomplished, good job.

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:02.702
Go, help the librarian! Leave him to me.

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:26.050
You follow a vampire into
the woods at night?

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:29.461
I thought you were a smart boy.

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:31.759
I'm officially in trouble now.

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:40.437
You librarians break so easily.

01:19:41.476 --> 01:19:44.138
- But tasty.
- You took my life away from me,

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:47.443
- but you don't get to take his!
- I gave you a gift!

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:49.710
Allow me to repay the favor!

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:16.100
Join us, Ivan, we can still
restore order to Russia.

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:22.609
I think it's time we pay the bill
for what we've already done.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.980
For Russia, old friend.

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:28.055
No!

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:45.170
<i>Populus tremuloides.</i>

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:47.903
<i>Populus tremuloides.</i>

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:11.690
I'm sorry for your pain my child, but,

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:17.029
as they say, "The more tortured the vine,
the sweeter the fruit."

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.066
I command you to stop

01:21:27.182 --> 01:21:28.672
Give me one reason

01:21:31.286 --> 01:21:35.450
Because I control the Judas Chalice,
so I control you.

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:39.757
Stupid boy. That's not how it works.

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:44.255
- Wrong move.
- Wrong hand.

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:49.961
<i>Populus tremuloides,</i> the aspen tree.

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:53.666
The original tree that killed
the original vampire, Judas Iscariot.

01:21:53.775 --> 01:21:58.269
Son, you make one hell of a historian.

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:29.410
Simone, I want you to come
back to New York with me.

01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:32.605
I mean, you already know everything about
the library, so I could show it to you.

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:35.945
I've never been able to share
it with anybody before.

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:39.384
I'm sorry, Flynn, I can't.
It's time for me to go.

01:22:39.487 --> 01:22:40.977
What? Back to France?

01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:44.923
You did it, Flynn.
You killed the vampire who made me.

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:47.961
My soul can be at rest now.
I can be at peace.

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:51.260
Rest? What, you mean die? No, no, no.

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:54.695
I already thought I lost you once,
I'm not gonna go through that again.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.532
It's all right, Flynn.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.073
I want peace.

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:03.677
I've lived long enough.
I've made every day count.

01:23:03.778 --> 01:23:05.541
We could be together.

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:07.671
There is a way.

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:29.993
You have to stay always a librarian.

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:34.500
You have to fulfill your destiny
as I have fulfilled mine.

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:38.111
Please, Flynn, sometimes
saying goodbye is...

01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:42.746
The right thing to do.

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:49.490
You know, there is one thing
you can do for me, though.

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:53.359
I've always wanted to see the sunrise again.

01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:57.054
Will you watch it with me?

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:21.478
It's beautiful.

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:36.631
I loved you, Flynn.

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.035
For a little while.

01:24:45.346 --> 01:24:46.711
I loved you.

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:54.646
Goodbye, Simone.

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:57.981
Goodbye, Flynn.

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:22.237
I have something for you.

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:25.506
- We did not authorize...
- It's a thank-you gift.

01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:37.148
- It's beautiful.
- Early 1800s, made by French monks.

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:41.956
- There's writing on it, what does it say?
- Latin.

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:44.122
It says, "Even into her..."

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.825
It says, "Follow your dream."

01:26:51.105 --> 01:26:53.505
And where did your dream lead you?

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:56.034
Home.

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:04.883
We're still not paying for any unauthorized...

01:27:04.986 --> 01:27:06.146
I know.

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:25.304
Oh, that's mine.

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:32.544
Well, Flynn, you've come through for us
once again. I'm just...

01:27:33.181 --> 01:27:36.048
Well, I'm just sorry we ruined your vacation.

01:27:36.150 --> 01:27:38.675
- I wouldn't say ruined.
- Oh, good.

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:42.957
So, have you decided on,

01:27:43.057 --> 01:27:46.686
you know, whether you're going
to stay on as a librarian or not?

01:27:46.794 --> 01:27:51.595
Somebody very special told me I should
embrace who I am. I think she was right.

01:27:51.699 --> 01:27:57.660
Good. Good, then we won't, you know,
we won't have any more of those...

01:27:57.772 --> 01:27:59.262
Meltdowns?

01:27:59.374 --> 01:28:00.841
- No.
- Good.

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:05.504
Because Charlene was thinking about
changing the locks.

01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:12.781
I know who you are.

01:28:14.255 --> 01:28:15.313
What?

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.825
Come on, Judson, I know that you
are over 2,000 years old.

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:27.993
And I also know that the library is pitched
in a larger battle between good and evil.

01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:31.565
Yahuda!

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.974
Yahoo to you, too.

01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:39.179
Flynn, I won't disagree that
there's a battle between good and evil,

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.909
and right now it seems like evil is winning.

01:28:43.017 --> 01:28:47.420
But soon, you and the library
are going to play

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:50.685
an even more important role
in that struggle.

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:57.425
And as far as my being 2,000 years old,
that's...

01:28:57.899 --> 01:29:01.630
Well, that's just insulting.

01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:08.409
Yeah.

01:29:09.977 --> 01:29:12.036
Yeah. Okay.

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:18.178
Yeah, I guess it is kind of silly
when you think about it.

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:19.651
- Scholar.
- Scholar?

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:21.585
The Tree of Knowledge.

01:30:01.586 --> 01:30:02.586
