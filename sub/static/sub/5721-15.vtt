in the backseat, please?

00:29.630 --> 00:32.064
[phone buzzing]

00:34.250 --> 00:36.377
My cell phone's ringing.
May I answer it?

00:36.420 --> 00:37.944
Yes, you may.

00:37.990 --> 00:40.038

00:40.080 --> 00:42.332
Hello, Eli.
I can't talk right now.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.642
ELI:
The FBI are investigating.

00:44.690 --> 00:46.123
I know.

00:46.170 --> 00:47.683
They're going after Peter.

00:47.740 --> 00:48.991
Wait, how do you know?

00:49.040 --> 00:50.644
Ruth came by my office.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.600
Look, I-I need to go.Wait.

00:52.660 --> 00:53.649
We're hiring a lavwer.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.304
Sounds like the smart thing
to do.

00:55.350 --> 00:56.521
Bye.

00:56.570 --> 00:57.787
[phone beeps off]

00:57.840 --> 00:59.489
[sighs]

00:59.530 --> 01:01.134
We need your help.

01:01.190 --> 01:02.703
We think they're coming after
Peter again.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.445
This is doctor's orders.
I am cursed

01:04.490 --> 01:06.230
with high blood pressure.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.498
[inhales, exhales]

01:08.540 --> 01:10.064
Just give me the bullet points.

01:10.110 --> 01:11.714
The FBI is asking questions.

01:11.760 --> 01:12.886
Professional or personal?

01:12.940 --> 01:14.419
Both.About Peter's conduct

01:14.460 --> 01:16.587
in office or running for office?Both.

01:16.640 --> 01:17.709
That sounds serious.

01:17.770 --> 01:20.022
Or is it a smokescreen?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.719
Or both.So... you need

01:22.770 --> 01:24.032
a lawyer to

01:24.080 --> 01:26.469
figure out
why you need a lawyer?Yes.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.511
The only thing
I know for sure, this...[exhales]

01:32.170 --> 01:34.957
[exhales] Like Gladiator,huh?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.343
Yes, like Gladiator. Well, then let's go.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.697
There's no time
to waste.

01:40.620 --> 01:43.134
PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay. Good.
Just a few more. Diane,

01:43.190 --> 01:44.441
can you look at Cory?Cary.

01:44.490 --> 01:46.481
Yes, sorry. Cary.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.144
Uh, you, sir, not so much teeth.

01:48.190 --> 01:50.658
Is this the right amount
of teeth?Yes.

01:50.710 --> 01:53.053
Great. Everybody say "ABA."

01:53.110 --> 01:54.930
ALL:
ABA.

01:54.980 --> 01:56.584
Good. Now just the women.

01:56.630 --> 01:58.109
WOMEN:
ABA.No, I mean the men

01:58.160 --> 01:59.457
can step out, take five.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.808
Thank you, men.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.066
[indistinct chatter]

02:03.120 --> 02:05.156
What's the spin of
this ABA article anyhow?

02:05.210 --> 02:06.723
I have no idea.

02:06.770 --> 02:10.251
My guess is:
third largest firm in Chicago.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.643
It's not about women
in the firm?No.

02:12.690 --> 02:14.999
Why?They sure are spending
a lot of time with the women.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.860
[sighs]
Okay, let's not go there.

02:16.910 --> 02:19.731
All publicity for the firm
is good publicity.No,

02:19.790 --> 02:22.873
actually, that's not true.PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, good.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.093
So that's it? Why are we waiting
around here like schmucks?

02:25.140 --> 02:27.005
David, he's probably just
moving into another room.

02:27.050 --> 02:28.790
Let's calm down. Hey,

02:28.840 --> 02:30.614
we moving
into another room?No. We're done.

02:30.670 --> 02:32.706
Thanks.DIANE: Uh,
he's coming back tomorrow.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.183
Yeah, but just to shoot the
women. Thanks, guys. Good shoot.

02:35.240 --> 02:38.368
Great. We'll just go back
to the cleaning and cooking.

02:38.410 --> 02:40.196
CARY:
So, this ABA article,

02:40.240 --> 02:41.798
what's it about?Well,

02:41.850 --> 02:42.805
what do you mean?

02:42.850 --> 02:44.192
The firm,

02:44.250 --> 02:45.808
I think.Women at the firm?

02:45.860 --> 02:48.420
No. Just the firm.

02:48.470 --> 02:51.428
This shoot tomorrow, he just
wants a photo of us with Alicia.

02:51.470 --> 02:52.858
That's all.She's not

02:52.910 --> 02:54.389
an equity partner.I know.

02:54.430 --> 02:56.773
I think
it's about name value.

02:56.820 --> 02:59.823
But he just wants
the female partners with her?

02:59.870 --> 03:03.306
Cary, it's nothing.
It's just an angle he's pushing.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.171
I don't think anything
will come of it. Okay?

03:10.010 --> 03:12.535
[indistinct chatter]

03:18.670 --> 03:20.922
LUCCA:
Did you need something?

03:22.150 --> 03:23.321
Yeah. Is Alicia out today?

03:23.370 --> 03:24.803
She had that personal thing.

03:24.850 --> 03:26.329
Oh, right.
Well, when she calls in,

03:26.380 --> 03:28.894
could you forward her to me?Yeah.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.596
What are you doing
for lunch today?

03:34.640 --> 03:35.811
Eating.

03:35.860 --> 03:38.556
Would you like to eat together?

03:38.600 --> 03:40.864

03:49.880 --> 03:51.359
You'll need to leave your
phone and personal effects.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.742
[phone beeps off]

03:52.790 --> 03:54.838

04:18.730 --> 04:20.516

04:20.560 --> 04:22.039
I see you two know each other.
Good.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.559
At the expense of sounding
like summer camp,

04:23.610 --> 04:24.907
I wouldn't mind if

04:24.960 --> 04:27.303
we went quickly around

bleeding heart.

Understood? Good.

05:27.230 --> 05:28.572
Martin.

05:28.630 --> 05:30.586
As I'm sure you're aware,
the executive branch

05:30.630 --> 05:32.757
has taken flack lately
for its legal justiﬁcation

05:32.810 --> 05:35.495
regarding Executive Order 12333.

05:35.550 --> 05:37.893

BARNSTONE:
In the past two years,

06:08.450 --> 06:10.964
eight Americans, ten Brits,
and two dozen Belgians

06:11.020 --> 06:13.363
have joined ISIS due
to Tahan's efforts.

06:13.410 --> 06:14.581
They credit his recruitment
on social media.

06:14.630 --> 06:16.586
CLEARY:
Mr. Tahan limits his appeals

06:16.630 --> 06:19.235
to the religious
importance of ISIS

06:19.290 --> 06:21.099
establishing
a caliphate.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.889
He hasn't specifically
promoted violence.

06:22.940 --> 06:24.726
However, his recruits
have been behind

06:24.770 --> 06:26.897
some of the worst atrocities
we've seen in Iraq and Syria.

06:26.950 --> 06:28.941
Beheadings, bombings, rape.

06:28.990 --> 06:30.946
KIRBY: And what do
you need from us?CLEARY: We know

06:30.990 --> 06:33.811
Tahan's location for
the next 48 hours.

06:33.870 --> 06:36.259
You have been_ selected
to give the administration

06:36.300 --> 06:38.211
legal justification to kill him.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.526
Jason Crouse. Hello.

06:48.580 --> 06:49.877
Hey.

06:49.930 --> 06:50.965
Good to have you working here.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.534
A new on-site investigator.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.048
How exciting.
I just wanted

06:55.110 --> 06:57.453
to introduce myself--
David Lee, family law.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.717
Nice to meet you.

07:00.200 --> 07:04.546
So, hey, there is something
I need right away.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.725
You kind of got
a cowboy thing going, don't you?

07:09.770 --> 07:12.944
Not intentionally.Well, I need work

07:12.990 --> 07:14.469
that I'll pay for
out of my pocket.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.078
Given that you're freelance,

07:16.130 --> 07:18.951
that shouldn't be a problem,
should it?What work?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.901
Diane Lockhart
is one of the name partners.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.177
You've heard of her?I have.

07:23.220 --> 07:25.393
I'm worried
she intends to make

07:25.440 --> 07:29.001
Lockhart, Agos & Lee
a fully female-run firm.

07:29.050 --> 07:32.178
So I need to know
the conversations she's having

07:32.230 --> 07:34.482
with Alicia
and the other female partners.

07:34.540 --> 07:36.405
Okay.

07:36.450 --> 07:38.918
That's it? No questions?

07:38.980 --> 07:40.368
No.

07:40.410 --> 07:41.661
Any for me?

07:41.720 --> 07:43.403
No.

08:00.610 --> 08:05.126
So, the people this Agent
Devereaux has approached are

08:05.180 --> 08:07.819
Judge Schakowsky, Ruth Eastman,

08:07.870 --> 08:10.088
and Mr. Gold's daughter.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.562
So far, yes.

08:11.620 --> 08:14.088
Huh.What's "huh"?

08:14.140 --> 08:16.051
You and the governor
are both wearing maroon ties.

08:19.020 --> 08:23.104
Is that important?Maroon signifies sacrifice
and bravery.

08:23.150 --> 08:27.018
So, Governor, why do you think
the FBI is interested in you?

08:27.070 --> 08:28.196
I have no idea.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.970
There must be something
that you've walked

08:31.030 --> 08:32.019
right up to the line on.

08:32.070 --> 08:33.799
Believe me, if I had any idea

08:33.860 --> 08:36.590
what this was about,
I'd tell you.Elsbeth,

08:36.640 --> 08:38.073
could you give
us a minute?

08:38.120 --> 08:41.203
I'll be right outside.

08:41.250 --> 08:44.469
I mean, not outside-outside.
Just out...

08:44.520 --> 08:47.080
there.

08:47.130 --> 08:48.643
[door shuts]

08:48.700 --> 08:51.123
You need to tell her everything.

08:51.180 --> 08:52.135
Iam.

08:52.180 --> 08:53.477
You're not.

08:53.530 --> 08:57.876
Eli, we've been together
a long time.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.059
Anything that I've done,
you've done.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.317
No.

09:02.890 --> 09:05.791
I did not try to fix an election
for Alicia.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.105
An FBI investigation is
a game-changer, Peter.

09:09.150 --> 09:10.970
All cards need to be
on the table.

09:11.020 --> 09:12.419
[knocking on door]In a minute, Elsbeth!

09:12.460 --> 09:14.633
Not now, Nora.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.580
The FBI just called.Tel| 'em
I'll call back.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.938
It wasn't for you.

09:18.990 --> 09:21.151
It was for me.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.722
CLEARY:
The threshold question is this:

09:24.780 --> 09:26.862
Does an ISIS recruiter
rise to the level

09:26.910 --> 09:28.605
of enemy combatant?

09:28.650 --> 09:30.732
JANOWAY; Is that the
only way this guy makes
it onto the kill list?

09:30.780 --> 09:32.600
CLEARY: Yes, if we want to avoid
blowback-- not just political

09:32.650 --> 09:34.959
but legal.HICKS: Has he
ever ﬁred a gun

09:35.000 --> 09:36.740
or killed anyone?No, not to
our knowledge.

09:36.790 --> 09:37.870
BARNSTONE:
But his recruits have.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.171
His recruits have
killed hundreds.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.219
Tahan's posted dozens

09:40.270 --> 09:41.612
of online calls
to join ISIS:

09:41.660 --> 09:44.049
Sleuthway, YouTube, Telegram.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.055
HICKS:
But has he

09:45.100 --> 09:46.613
ever espoused violence?

09:46.670 --> 09:48.058
No.KIRBY: Well, the fact
that he doesn't

09:48.100 --> 09:50.182
overtly espouse violence
just shows

09:50.240 --> 09:52.014
how sophisticated
ISIS has become.

09:52.060 --> 09:53.277
But how do you judge that?

09:53.330 --> 09:54.888
He talks about
establishing the caliphate,

09:54.940 --> 09:56.362
which makes him
more of a preacher

09:56.420 --> 09:57.717
than anything else.KIRBY:
ISIS isn't a religion.

09:57.770 --> 10:00.022
It's a terrorist group
with one goal, which is

10:00.070 --> 10:02.118
to convert or kill anyone who
doesn't believe what they do.HICKS: Yes, but Tahan isn't

10:02.160 --> 10:03.502
actually doing these things.
It's his recruits.

10:03.550 --> 10:04.983
Why are you protecting him,
Captain?

10:05.030 --> 10:06.634
I'm not protecting anyone.
I'm thinking

10:06.690 --> 10:08.590
of the message it sends
to other nations

10:08.650 --> 10:11.813
if we call a recruiter
an enemy combatant.

10:11.870 --> 10:14.088
Once we do that, what's next?
Targeting imams,

10:14.130 --> 10:16.382
college professors?KIRBY: When they
advocate violent attacks

10:16.440 --> 10:17.828
on Americans, yes.Then what's the pushback

10:17.870 --> 10:19.269
on Putin when he says

10:19.310 --> 10:21.778
he can take out
a Ukrainian YouTube star

10:21.830 --> 10:23.354
who he claims
is an agitator?

10:23.400 --> 10:25.265
JANOWAY: If the YouTube star
is telling people to go to Paris

10:25.320 --> 10:28.187
and shoot up concert halls,
I say, "Go, Putin."

10:28.230 --> 10:29.663
HICKS: The United States
has always held

10:29.710 --> 10:32.315
that a propagandist
is not a combatant

10:32.370 --> 10:35.498
and is therefore immune
from targeted killing.

10:35.540 --> 10:37.929
No. Look at Junaid Hussain.
He was a propagandist,

10:37.980 --> 10:41.325
and we killed him.So we...

10:43.120 --> 10:44.803
Go ahead, Mrs. Florrick. Please.

10:44.860 --> 10:48.819
So we're supposed to wait
until Tahan plans

10:48.860 --> 10:50.851
a successful attack
before we stop him?

10:52.690 --> 10:54.464
CLEARY: I take it
you don't think we should.

10:54.520 --> 10:59.128
I... I think we need to do
everything we can, legally,

10:59.180 --> 11:00.909
to stop ISIS.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.009
I agree
with Mrs. Florrick.

11:04.050 --> 11:06.393
Has Tahan purposefully and
materially supported hostilities

11:06.440 --> 11:09.739
against the U.S.?
That is our only question.

11:09.790 --> 11:11.098
What material has he provided?

11:11.140 --> 11:13.096
Bodies-- you asked how

11:13.150 --> 11:16.017
he materially
supported the enemy.

11:16.060 --> 11:17.368
He's supplied the bodies

11:17.410 --> 11:20.231
for the bombs.

11:22.460 --> 11:24.416
Okay. I think we should vote.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.587
Is Massoud Tahan
an enemy combatant

11:26.640 --> 11:29.598
and can he be placed
on a targeted kill list?

11:29.640 --> 11:31.073
To my right, please.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.849
BARNSTONE:
Aye.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.162
KIRBY:
Aye.

11:34.210 --> 11:35.245
Nay.

11:35.300 --> 11:36.380
Aye.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.079
JANOWAY: Aye.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.735
It_ carries. Massoud Tahan
is an enemy combatant

11:40.780 --> 11:43.248
and can be placed on
a targeted kill list.

11:43.310 --> 11:46.211
We will write up the
legal justification. But first,

11:46.270 --> 11:47.567
there is
one other matter.

11:47.610 --> 11:49.134
Sorry I can't agree.

11:49.180 --> 11:51.307
You don't have to apologize.
We all have our opinions.

11:51.360 --> 11:54.136
Pass these around,
please.

11:54.190 --> 11:56.704
You may break
the seals.

11:59.020 --> 12:01.272
This is
Lance Hopper.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.924
He was born
and raised in Chicago.

12:02.980 --> 12:05.232
Went to Chicago Polytech,
where he studied

12:05.280 --> 12:06.929
comparative religions.

12:06.980 --> 12:08.766
He disappeared
about two years ago.

12:08.810 --> 12:10.721
He resurfaced in Syria

12:10.770 --> 12:12.988
and called himself
Massoud Tahan.

12:17.210 --> 12:19.724
So the man you want to kill
is an American?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.202
That's correct.

12:21.260 --> 12:24.343
So let's talk.

12:39.190 --> 12:40.964
CLEARY: You may wonder
why we did it this way,

12:41.020 --> 12:42.146
waited to tell you that

12:42.190 --> 12:44.317
Mr. Tahan was
an American Citizen.

12:44.370 --> 12:46.668
There are
two threshold questions,

12:46.720 --> 12:49.063
and we wanted to answer one
before we answered the other.

12:49.110 --> 12:51.840
BARNSTONE: Everything we
said about Tahan was true.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.152
We were merely trying to
eliminate bias and emotion.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.679
HICKS:
What's wrong with emotion?

12:55.730 --> 12:57.812
It clouds judgment.Sometimes it clarifies it.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.589
_ If Massoud Tahan
is an enemy combatant,

12:59.640 --> 13:02.939
then so is Lance Hopper.But an American
has First Amendment rights.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.946
Hopper can say and
believe whatever he wants.
He's not in trouble for talking.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.558
He's in trouble for being
an enemy combatant.Yes,

13:06.610 --> 13:09.033
but we only concluded
he was an enemy combatant

13:09.090 --> 13:12.309
because of what he said.CLEARY:
I'm not sure that's accurate.

13:12.350 --> 13:14.693
Just as Mrs. Florrick
put so eloquently,

13:14.750 --> 13:17.696
he supplied materials in the
form of bodies to carry bombs.

13:17.750 --> 13:21.663
Still, if he's an American,
he gets due process.

13:23.360 --> 13:26.921
Are you withdrawing your support
for the targeted strike?

13:26.980 --> 13:28.845
No. But I want to know more.

13:28.890 --> 13:30.755
There's nothing more to know
if you still support

13:30.810 --> 13:34.803
the targeted strike.

13:34.850 --> 13:35.839
Withdraw your support

13:35.900 --> 13:36.844
for the air strike,

13:36.900 --> 13:38.765
and we'll be
told more.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.888
I withdraw my support.

13:42.950 --> 13:45.168
Temporarily.

13:45.210 --> 13:48.600
Okay. Let's get started.

13:48.650 --> 13:50.550
Why did you tell
the FBI anything?

13:50.610 --> 13:51.998
I'm so sorry.PETER:
It's fine, Nora.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.861
Just tell us
what you told him.He wanted to know

13:54.920 --> 13:56.603
who calls here for Eli
and who Eli calls.

13:56.660 --> 13:57.911
What'd you tell him?I said a million calls

13:57.960 --> 13:59.916
go through this office
every day,

13:59.960 --> 14:01.518
and I don't write down names.
I didn't say

14:01.570 --> 14:03.879
you tell me not to
write down names.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.704
Did he ask
about anyone specific?

14:07.930 --> 14:09.625
Nora, you can speak freely. Go.He asked

14:09.670 --> 14:11.843
if Judge Schakowsky
ever comes by.

14:11.890 --> 14:14.017
That's when I got
a bad feeling.You're kidding.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.879
Nora knows.

14:15.940 --> 14:16.929
ELSBETH:
Nora knows what?

14:16.980 --> 14:20.245
Well, there is
one potential... issue.

14:20.290 --> 14:22.019
ELSBETH:
There always is.

14:22.070 --> 14:22.889
What's yours?

14:23.990 --> 14:25.890
Vote rigging.

14:25.950 --> 14:28.555
Okay.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.943
Let's crack open
the green notebook.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.867
That's for serious notes.

14:33.910 --> 14:36.162
DIANE:
Would you like to sit down?No, I'm good.

14:36.220 --> 14:37.608
It would make me
more comfortable.

14:39.570 --> 14:43.131
So, um, are you working on
the Van DerWerff divorce?

14:43.180 --> 14:45.091
No.

14:45.140 --> 14:46.698
Well, the reason I ask is

14:46.750 --> 14:48.923
I saw David Lee meeting with you
this morning.

14:48.970 --> 14:51.222
I thought it was
about the Van DerWerff divorce.

14:51.280 --> 14:54.499
It wasn't.
So he was just
introducing himself?

14:58.980 --> 14:59.935
What's wrong?

14:59.980 --> 15:01.584
Nothing.

15:01.630 --> 15:04.110
Are you doing freelance work
for David Lee?

15:04.160 --> 15:06.025
If I was doing freelance work
for David,

15:06.070 --> 15:08.152
I wouldn't be able to tell you.

15:08.210 --> 15:10.371
Same as if I were doing
freelance work for you.

15:10.430 --> 15:11.988
I wouldn't
be able to tell him.

15:12.040 --> 15:15.123
So he's asking you
to do freelance work?

15:15.170 --> 15:17.638
I better get back to work.

15:17.690 --> 15:21.080
Did he ask you
to investigate me?

15:24.740 --> 15:26.913
I better get back to work.

15:28.270 --> 15:32.058
David Lee loves_ to create
paran0ia and dissen5ion.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.874
Don't help him.

15:33.930 --> 15:35.318
Good to know.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.362
CARY:
So how are you liking it here?

15:40.410 --> 15:42.401
Fine.

15:42.460 --> 15:44.360
Really?

15:44.420 --> 15:46.411
"Fine" never
sounds very fine.

15:46.460 --> 15:48.189
No, it's fine.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.150
And how's Alicia handling it?

15:50.210 --> 15:52.201
Fine.
[laughs]

15:52.250 --> 15:56.209
Has Diane approached Alicia
about her position at the firm?

15:56.250 --> 15:57.854
I don't know.

15:57.910 --> 15:59.810
What do you mean?

15:59.870 --> 16:02.338
Last year, there was an attempt
to make this a female-run firm,

16:02.390 --> 16:05.120
and I just wanted to know
if there's been a new attempt.

16:05.180 --> 16:07.740
Well, that's a question
for Alicia.But Alicia's MIA today.

16:07.790 --> 16:10.304
And you're Alicia's friend,
so I'm asking you.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.396
I'll tell her you want to talk.

16:16.190 --> 16:17.703
Where you headed?

16:17.750 --> 16:19.923
Out for some air. You?

16:19.970 --> 16:22.018
No idea.

16:22.060 --> 16:23.539
This place is insane.

16:23.590 --> 16:25.239
[elevator bell dings]

16:28.370 --> 16:30.019
Alicia, it's Cary.

16:30.070 --> 16:32.504
I know you're out today,
but I need you to call.

16:32.550 --> 16:34.108
[phone beeps]

16:34.160 --> 16:36.242
LUCCA:
Hey. So this is a weird firm.

16:36.290 --> 16:37.814
I need some advice.

16:37.860 --> 16:40.112
[phone beeps]

16:40.170 --> 16:42.035
Alicia. Diane.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.251
We need to talk.

16:47.610 --> 16:48.998
[beep]

16:50.570 --> 16:53.209
JASON:
Yeah, so... I'll talk to you.

16:53.270 --> 16:55.397
HICKS:
I think you might want

16:55.440 --> 16:57.396
to come inside. We're reviewing
Lance Hopper's statements.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.395
HOPPER:
...longed for the Caliphate
to be restored.

16:59.450 --> 17:01.486
Well, we now have it.

17:01.540 --> 17:03.929
So the righteous
and the rightly guided must--

17:03.970 --> 17:05.403
Three conditions must be met

17:05.450 --> 17:07.270
for the targeted killing
of a U.S. citizen.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.890
Please refer
to your binders.

17:09.940 --> 17:12.329
"One: the individual
poses an imminent threat

17:12.370 --> 17:14.110
_"of violent_attack
against the United States.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.321
"Two: the capture of the
individual is not feasible.

17:16.380 --> 17:18.678
"And three:
the operation is conducted

17:18.730 --> 17:21.506
consistent with applicable
law of war principles."

17:21.560 --> 17:23.949
CLEARY:
The job of this panel
is to decide if

17:23.990 --> 17:25.946
the three conditions are met.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.649
We are Lance Hopper's
due process.

17:27.690 --> 17:29.999
Okay. Let's talk
about imminent.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.692
All of these _are
past atrOCIties.

17:33.740 --> 17:35.958
Even if I concede
that Tahan--

17:36.010 --> 17:38.353
or, make that, Hopper--
is somehow responsible,

17:38.400 --> 17:39.879
they've already happened.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.263
An imminent threat is
necessarily a future one.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.663
Are we aware
of any future threats?

17:44.710 --> 17:46.962
Yes. He posted that
video two days ago.

17:47.020 --> 17:48.920
But that wasn't a threat.BARNSTONE: Yes, but
you said so yourself, ma'am.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.231
"Are we supposed to wait

17:50.280 --> 17:51.531
until he plans
another successful attack?"

17:51.590 --> 17:53.194
But the threshold has changed.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.491
Now it's about imminence.

17:54.550 --> 17:56.279
Imminent means seconds,
minutes, hours.

17:56.330 --> 17:58.321
BARNSTONE:
No. This administration defines

17:58.380 --> 18:00.723
"imminent" as anything
under 60 days.
Seriously?

18:00.770 --> 18:02.374
CLEARY: Technically,
since the enemy

18:02.420 --> 18:04.376
is so good
at hiding their attacks,

18:06.430 --> 18:07.249
is now considered
imminent.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.689
According to whom?

18:11.040 --> 18:12.769
The Department of Justice.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.127
That's nothing more
than legal wordplay.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.647
No, it's trying to account

18:15.700 --> 18:17.349
for the_ realities of war.KIRBY:
Havmg spent my career

18:17.400 --> 18:19.209
in the Army, I understand
the realities very clearly.

18:19.270 --> 18:20.999
The country I serve doesn't try

18:21.050 --> 18:23.006
to weasel out
of what it always stood for,

18:23.050 --> 18:24.654
just because
it happens to be convenient.

18:24.710 --> 18:27.224
Imminent should mean imminent.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.272
Maybe we should vote again.

18:30.320 --> 18:33.790
Actually, we've got 30 hours
to make the decision.

18:33.850 --> 18:35.841
Let's take the night,

18:35.890 --> 18:37.323
_ and come back
in the morning and vote.

18:37.370 --> 18:38.587
Why are we taking the night?

18:38.630 --> 18:41.326
Because we can.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.208
Okay. Hm.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.242
[muttering]

18:50.650 --> 18:52.208
[shrieks]

18:52.260 --> 18:53.249
Sorry.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.420
Sorry.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.254
Just wanted to_ make sure
you were settling in okay.

18:58.310 --> 19:01.177
Uh, yup, all... good.

19:01.220 --> 19:02.824
What's this?

19:02.880 --> 19:05.394
Oh, I'm a visual processor.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.260
And slightly
kinesthetic-tactile.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.924
[laughs]

19:08.970 --> 19:10.574
Oh!
What?

19:10.620 --> 19:12.178
What did Ruth Eastman
do for the campaign?

19:12.230 --> 19:13.709
Uh, she was
the campaign manager.

19:13.760 --> 19:17.321
Strategy, donors, coalitions.

19:19.370 --> 19:20.587
Mm...

19:20.630 --> 19:22.359
Are you thinking vote rigging?

19:22.420 --> 19:23.717
Could be.

19:23.770 --> 19:26.284
Schakowslq knew, Nora knew.

19:26.330 --> 19:27.934
Did Ruth know?

19:27.990 --> 19:30.208
No, she joined the campaign
long after that.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.423
Ah.
Unless Peter told her.

19:32.470 --> 19:35.166
Campaign managers
push their candidates to

19:35.210 --> 19:37.861
admit all before signing on.

19:37.910 --> 19:42.734
So, Ruth... might...
have... known.

19:42.790 --> 19:45.953
Aha. So, the question is,

19:46.010 --> 19:48.433
did she?
Who is that?
I can't even read that.

19:48.490 --> 19:50.617
Oh, your daughter. Marissa.

19:50.660 --> 19:52.002
Why her?

19:53.010 --> 19:54.409
I have no idea.

19:54.450 --> 19:56.486
Then let's talk to her.

20:07.330 --> 20:08.319
[sighs]

20:11.470 --> 20:14.075
Oh, come on.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.215
[sighs]

20:29.920 --> 20:32.354
;%,'.;f::z-s—.j:?
zig—if/(é

20:32.400 --> 20:35.005
So, you're working late.

20:35.050 --> 20:37.223
No later than you.

20:37.270 --> 20:40.148
Just seeing
what piled up on my desk.

20:41.630 --> 20:43.882
Um, want something to drink?

20:43.930 --> 20:45.978
No, I'm all right.

20:48.550 --> 20:52.111
Could you, um...?

20:52.160 --> 20:53.411
[chuckles]

20:53.460 --> 20:54.461
Yeah.

21:05.820 --> 21:08.994
So, people really don't trust
each other around here, do they?

21:09.050 --> 21:10.563
[laughs]

21:10.610 --> 21:11.827
Not much.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.610
Let me ask you something.

21:13.660 --> 21:16.914
Is Diane trying to make this
into an all-female firm?

21:16.970 --> 21:18.528
No idea.

21:18.580 --> 21:20.571
Who's worried? Cary?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.404
Wow.
Uh-huh.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.623
Look at that.
Very manly.

21:25.670 --> 21:28.366
You sure?
I'm good.

21:28.410 --> 21:30.844
So, Diane's never said
anything about it?

21:32.200 --> 21:34.805
An all-female firm?

21:34.850 --> 21:37.410
Uh, maybe a year or so ago,

21:37.470 --> 21:40.416
but a lot's happened.

21:41.690 --> 21:44.204
Do you think
I drink too much?

21:44.250 --> 21:48.607
I don't know. Do you?

21:48.650 --> 21:51.210
I was gonna break this bottle
if I couldn't get the cork out.

21:51.260 --> 21:54.309
[laughs]That might be a problem.

21:54.350 --> 21:56.432
Then here.
Wait. No.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.004
No, no, seriously,
you don't need it.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.779
Let's just...
let's just talk.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.228
Jason, come on.

22:01.270 --> 22:02.828
You don't need it,
seriously.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.928
Okay, yes,
but I want it.

22:04.970 --> 22:08.224
Hey, wait... just...
try something for a minute.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.748
[laughs]
Close your eyes.
Just close 'em.

22:15.940 --> 22:17.669
[chuckles]

22:17.720 --> 22:19.244
Take a deep breath.

22:19.290 --> 22:20.939
[inhales and
exhales deeply]

22:20.990 --> 22:22.890
Slow it down.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.633
[exhales]

22:24.690 --> 22:27.329
If this doesn't work,
do I get the glass?

22:27.380 --> 22:30.076
Shh.

22:30.130 --> 22:31.939
[exhales]

22:32.000 --> 22:36.516
Just... listen
to yourself breathe.

22:36.570 --> 22:38.561
[whispering]:
I don't meditate, Jason.

22:38.610 --> 22:41.875
[whispering]:
Okay, then we won't
call this meditation.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.878
Just... listen.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.354
To what?

22:47.400 --> 22:49.925
My breathing.

23:12.430 --> 23:14.204
[whispering]:
That's Security.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.296
They turn the lights
off after 11:00.

23:16.350 --> 23:18.864
Shh,shh,shh,shh,shh.

23:37.630 --> 23:38.619
[unzipping]

24:02.650 --> 24:03.992
Anything else?

24:04.050 --> 24:07.133
So why did you know
about the vote rigging?

24:07.180 --> 24:09.910
Because you were
Mrs. Florrick's body woman?Yes.

24:09.970 --> 24:12.359
Keeper of confidences,
you know?

24:12.400 --> 24:14.356
Pourer of comfort cereal.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.004
What kind of cereal?

24:16.060 --> 24:17.618
I don't know. Life.

24:17.670 --> 24:18.625
Wheat Chex. Why?

24:18.670 --> 24:20.661
I like Wheat Chex.

24:24.020 --> 24:26.625
Did Agent Devereaux ask
about anything else?

24:26.680 --> 24:28.580
MARISSA:
Uh, no.

24:28.640 --> 24:31.108
I guess he asked about
my dad's rich friends,

24:31.160 --> 24:32.980
and then he asked
about working for Alicia.

24:33.030 --> 24:34.509
And that was it?

24:34.560 --> 24:36.505
Yeah.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.687
Well, he asked
about my time in Israel,

24:38.730 --> 24:41.995
and the IDF
and the dairy farm I worked on.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.339
And I talked
about my purse business.

24:45.390 --> 24:48.689
You sell purses?No, I make them.

24:48.740 --> 24:50.139
I didn't really
end up selling any.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.522
Oh. What did they look like?

24:51.570 --> 24:52.912
The purses?

24:52.960 --> 24:54.916
Really cool.

24:54.970 --> 24:57.746
Kind of macram
with leather straps

24:57.800 --> 24:59.836
and things sewn into them.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.017
Wow. What things?

25:01.060 --> 25:02.539
Things I found,

25:02.580 --> 25:04.445
like kewpie dolls
and bullet shells.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.661
Wow.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.456
Uh-oh.
ELI:
What?

25:16.510 --> 25:17.465
I have to go.

25:17.510 --> 25:20.638
Where?
Um... away.

25:20.690 --> 25:22.294
I can't be Peter's lavwer.

25:22.340 --> 25:24.035
Wait. What? Why?

25:24.080 --> 25:25.638
Uh, well, I can't really say.

25:25.690 --> 25:26.907
You can't?

25:26.960 --> 25:29.349
Elsbeth, wait. What?!

25:29.390 --> 25:31.779
Bye. Oh, um,

25:31.830 --> 25:33.309
here's my card.

25:33.350 --> 25:34.305
Write me about
your purses.

25:34.350 --> 25:35.521
I want to buy one.

25:37.880 --> 25:38.869
[door closes]

25:41.710 --> 25:43.701
So, you don't want
to hire me for anything,

25:43.750 --> 25:45.752
but that's your lawyer?

25:47.580 --> 25:48.626
Alicia Florrick...

25:48.670 --> 25:50.888
Here you go.
Thank you.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.749
Would you mind
getting in the...?
No problem.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.280
CLEARY:
Good. Mrs. Florrick.

25:58.330 --> 25:59.763
I think we're ready.

25:59.810 --> 26:02.028
Good. I am, too.Great.

26:02.080 --> 26:06.596
Let's take our seats, and we
can pick up where we left off.

26:06.650 --> 26:09.733
The question is: is Lance
Hopper an imminent threat

26:09.780 --> 26:11.475
to the United States?

26:11.520 --> 26:13.693
Now, if everyone is prepared
to vote, we can move...

26:13.740 --> 26:15.605
Um, I'm sorry,
but Captain Hicks--

26:15.660 --> 26:17.218
where is he?

26:17.270 --> 26:19.955
The captain has been excused
from these proceedings.

26:20.010 --> 26:22.649
He...? What does that mean?That means

26:22.710 --> 26:24.359
he will not_ be
continumg With us.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.743
Now we should
really move on.
Why?

26:29.500 --> 26:32.401
Well, the reasons
are confidential, Mrs. Florrick.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.621
We really need to move on.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.625
No. I'm sorry,
but I would like to know

26:36.680 --> 26:38.238
why Captain Hicks isn't here,

26:38.290 --> 26:40.064
and I don't think
I'm the only one.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.371
Actually, I think you are.

26:41.420 --> 26:42.853
No. I want to know, too.

26:46.340 --> 26:49.980
CLEARY:
Everyone here is subject
to confidentiality rules,

26:50.040 --> 26:52.508
and the captain is
currently being questioned

26:52.560 --> 26:54.699
about certain... leaks.

26:54.740 --> 26:56.219
You're saying he leaked?

26:56.260 --> 26:58.649
No, it's not my position
to say he leaked.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.133
I'm merely saying
he's being questioned

27:00.180 --> 27:01.738
about certain leaks.

27:01.790 --> 27:04.486
Now we need to vote.
In 12 hours,

27:04.530 --> 27:07.181
Hopper is going to be moved.
Does he pose

27:07.230 --> 27:08.959
an imminent threat
of Violence against

27:09.010 --> 27:10.921
the United States?
Yes.
He does.

27:10.970 --> 27:12.221
Are there any no's?

27:17.370 --> 27:18.758
JANOWAY:
So it's a tie.

27:18.810 --> 27:21.802
Which I will break
with a "yes."

27:21.850 --> 27:23.579
So condition one is met.
We'll move on to condition two.

27:23.640 --> 27:27.155
Is capture at all feasible?

27:27.210 --> 27:30.816
Why can't you be
Peter's attorney?
I can't say.

27:30.860 --> 27:32.168
Does it have something to
do with the vote rigging?

27:32.210 --> 27:33.381
[sighs]

27:33.430 --> 27:35.466
Rock once for yes,
twice for no.
Oh.

27:37.170 --> 27:39.343
Namaste.
Elsbeth...

27:39.390 --> 27:41.699
give me something.
Fine.

27:41.740 --> 27:43.389
But then you really have to go.

27:47.660 --> 27:49.787
What is this?

27:49.840 --> 27:51.489
It's not a what.
It's a he.

27:52.970 --> 27:54.790
MichaelTascioni?

27:54.840 --> 27:57.843
My ex.

27:57.890 --> 28:00.051
Nice to meet you.

28:00.110 --> 28:02.328
It's good to have you
on board.

28:02.370 --> 28:04.713
I'm sorry
that I had to bring Tom,

28:04.770 --> 28:07.898
but, uh, El insists
he gets separation anxiety,

28:07.940 --> 28:10.807
and, well,
since we share custody...

28:11.770 --> 28:14.238
Uh, your ex-wife came back
for her notes.

28:14.300 --> 28:15.904
I-I tried to look at them
before, but...

28:15.950 --> 28:17.429
They made no sense?
[laughs]

28:17.470 --> 28:19.859
No. Scribbles, stickers.

28:19.910 --> 28:22.697
She used to do the same thing
to pick our vacation spots.

28:22.740 --> 28:24.469
Piles of index cards.

28:24.520 --> 28:27.341
And on top,
"Hello. My name is Sedona."

28:27.400 --> 28:28.742
"Hello. My name is Peru."

28:28.790 --> 28:30.519
Drove me nuts.

28:30.570 --> 28:32.879
[chuckles lightly]So we're starting
from scratch.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.228
Not entirely.

28:34.270 --> 28:36.352
I can tell you that, uh,

28:36.410 --> 28:40.756
the FBI is not investigating
the governor for vote rigging.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.109
They're not?

28:43.150 --> 28:45.539
How can you be so sure?Because you went
into this assuming

28:45.590 --> 28:47.285
that was about vote rigging.

28:47.330 --> 28:49.890
That was the pattern El was
trying to trace with her cards.

28:49.940 --> 28:51.931
So if she was conflicted
out about that,

28:51.990 --> 28:54.675
then she would've known it
from the beginning?Exactly.

28:54.730 --> 28:58.461
What was being said when she
realized she was conflicted out?

28:58.510 --> 29:00.592
Well, she was questioning
my daughter,

29:00.650 --> 29:02.777
and they were talking
about the IDF,

29:02.820 --> 29:04.776
working on

29:04.830 --> 29:07.776
an Israeli dairy farm, uh...

29:07.830 --> 29:09.479
and purses

29:09.530 --> 29:11.566
she was making.Yeah, El loves purses.

29:11.610 --> 29:14.397
Mm. Then Agent Devereaux--
the FBI agent--

29:14.440 --> 29:16.658
uh, the questions
he had about Alicia,

29:16.710 --> 29:17.779
working with her...

29:17.840 --> 29:19.796
uh, my rich friends.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.273
Your rich friends,

29:21.320 --> 29:23.788
who are they-- donors?I don't know.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.979
There's your conflict.
She has a client.

29:26.020 --> 29:28.068
A client that could
lead back to me?Yes.

29:28.110 --> 29:29.668
We need Elsbeth's client list.

29:29.720 --> 29:30.800
How do we get that?

29:30.850 --> 29:33.410
Do you have any water?

29:33.460 --> 29:35.189
Yes, yes.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.502
MICHAEL: Yeah.

29:38.900 --> 29:40.891
Thank you.

29:42.690 --> 29:45.386
So how do we figure out

29:45.430 --> 29:47.739
who the conflict of interest is?

29:47.780 --> 29:49.691
We find Elsbeth's client list.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.041
How do we get that?

30:07.370 --> 30:10.009
I'd like to request the
case file for my divorce.

30:10.060 --> 30:11.664
Name, I.D.,

30:11.720 --> 30:13.494
date action became final.

30:13.550 --> 30:16.417
Michael B. Tascioni.
July 28, 2012.

30:16.460 --> 30:19.759
We don't allow dogs
in this office.

30:19.810 --> 30:22.244
Would you mind
taking him outside?Tom is a service animal.

30:22.290 --> 30:24.110
He's an emotional
support chihuahua.

30:25.560 --> 30:26.777
Hold on a minute.

30:28.170 --> 30:30.866
So, what does a case file
from your divorce do?

30:30.910 --> 30:32.866
Our property settlement
agreement is still pending.

30:32.910 --> 30:35.128
It values my law practice
and Elsbeth's and contains

30:35.180 --> 30:36.863
a list _of all
our clients.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.569
Ah, smart.

30:38.610 --> 30:40.089
Are you a cat person?

30:40.140 --> 30:42.358
No. I'm a person person.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.265
Why?

30:44.320 --> 30:46.709
Read here, or I can reprint
for ten cents a page.

30:46.750 --> 30:49.275
Can you please...I'l| look at it.

30:49.320 --> 30:50.878
I'll recognize anyone
connected to Peter.

30:50.930 --> 30:53.535
It's in the appendix.
First page.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.328
You've got to be kidding me.

30:56.370 --> 30:58.895
What is it?How can one client
be redacted?

30:58.940 --> 31:01.989
Oh, I got an order from a judge.

31:02.030 --> 31:03.986
The judicial system
takes the secrecy

31:04.030 --> 31:06.590
of a grand jury
witness seriously.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.813
You should, too.

31:08.860 --> 31:10.646
Tommy.

31:10.690 --> 31:13.909
I waited around just to see you.

31:13.950 --> 31:15.998
You knew I was coming?

31:16.040 --> 31:18.042
I know you, dear.

31:18.090 --> 31:20.866
And I know you.

31:22.310 --> 31:23.959
I'm coming for you.

31:24.010 --> 31:25.830
Tell me when.
[giggleS]

31:25.880 --> 31:28.098
I don't want
to miss it.

31:31.670 --> 31:32.967
Isn't she something?

31:33.020 --> 31:34.976
Yes.

31:35.020 --> 31:37.011
Fantastic.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.618
What now?

31:38.670 --> 31:40.069
Now...

31:40.110 --> 31:41.714
we get smart.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.842
I want you to talk with her.And say what?

31:43.900 --> 31:46.983
I want you to say something
that will make her paranoid.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.021
What's that?

31:51.080 --> 31:53.981
What else?JASON: Nothing else.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.998
Diane Lockhart's not maneuvering
to make this an all-female firm.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.088
And Alicia?

31:59.130 --> 32:01.598
A year ago, Diane suggested

32:01.650 --> 32:04.118
to Alicia that this could be
an all-female partnership.

32:04.180 --> 32:06.045
But they didn't pursue it.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.170
As far as you know.

32:07.220 --> 32:10.838
Yeah, as far as I know.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.610
Did Diane question you
about our concerns?

32:15.190 --> 32:17.090
Yes.She did?

32:17.150 --> 32:20.313
_ Yes. She saw me
leavmg your ofﬁce yesterday.

32:20.370 --> 32:21.974
What did you say?

32:22.020 --> 32:23.146
I said my freelance work

32:23.200 --> 32:24.098
for you was confidential.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.633
Okay, so

32:27.680 --> 32:30.069
she had a deal with Alicia
a year ago to make this

32:30.120 --> 32:33.112
an all-female firm-- why isn't
she still coming after us?

32:33.160 --> 32:36.778
You asked me to look
for evidence if she was.

32:36.820 --> 32:38.128
I did.

32:38.170 --> 32:39.774
There is none.

32:39.820 --> 32:41.868
Yeah, but she knew you
were investigating,

32:41.910 --> 32:44.993
so maybe she prevented you
from finding that evidence.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.086
I can't answer that.

32:47.130 --> 32:49.178
Why not?Because I deal in evidence.

32:49.220 --> 32:51.131
I don't deal in states of mind.

32:51.180 --> 32:54.001
You think we're being paranoid?

32:54.050 --> 32:57.008
I haven't been here long enough
to answer that conclusively.

32:57.060 --> 32:59.836
Okay. Thanks.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.192
[phone buzzing]

33:12.200 --> 33:14.589
Hey, this is Jason.
Leave a message.

33:17.290 --> 33:18.848
Mrs. Florrick.

33:18.900 --> 33:19.901
We should talk.

33:19.950 --> 33:21.645
Sure.

33:21.690 --> 33:23.646
May I just say this?

33:23.690 --> 33:25.999
I know Captain Hicks.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.735
He's one of the most
honest men I know.

33:27.780 --> 33:29.122
He wouldn't leak.Yet there was a leak.

33:29.180 --> 33:31.045
Where? 'Cause I've been
searching the Web

33:31.090 --> 33:33.695
and there's no reference
to what we're d0ing here.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.524
This was an internal leak
at the State Department.

33:35.570 --> 33:37.049
What does that mean?

33:37.100 --> 33:39.136
_ It means there was
an interdepartmental squabble

33:39.190 --> 33:41.090
and somebody leaked
what we're doing here

33:41.140 --> 33:42.482
to another department.Well, that wasn't

33:42.540 --> 33:44.314
Captain Hicks;
he wouldn't do that.

33:44.370 --> 33:45.928
Yeah.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.538
That's why
we need to talk to you.

33:52.240 --> 33:53.286
To me-- are you kidding?

33:53.330 --> 33:54.581
No.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.062
ALICIA:
You think I leaked?

33:56.120 --> 33:58.111
CLEARY: Well, I know
that you and Captain Hicks

33:58.160 --> 34:00.333
have been against this
project as soon as you found out

34:00.380 --> 34:02.814
that Massoud Tahan
was an American Citizen.

34:02.860 --> 34:06.250
ALICIA: So you want
to get rid of both of us.Uh-oh. Alicia's in trouble.

34:06.300 --> 34:07.335
Why? What'd she do?

34:07.390 --> 34:09.119
They think she's the leak.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.119
[laughs softly]

34:20.530 --> 34:22.225
She's working
for the Pentagon?Alicia Florrick? Yes,

34:22.270 --> 34:23.999
on an ad-hoc basis.As a civilian consultant.

34:24.060 --> 34:26.221
Shut up, J.No, he's right.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.363
So she's vetted?By the Pentagon, but not us.

34:29.410 --> 34:32.584
They didn't find out
about our three-hop warrant.Right.

34:32.630 --> 34:34.234
And we were following her
for a different reason.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.623
You know, because of the...
you know...

34:36.680 --> 34:38.284
She was representing Dellinger.

34:38.330 --> 34:39.638
You know, the worker
who fled to Iceland.

34:39.680 --> 34:41.636
So we overheard some
confidential information

34:41.680 --> 34:43.159
from the Pentagon,

34:43.210 --> 34:45.246
she was on her
phone leaking to...Uh, no.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.597
She was just talking
nearher phone.

34:46.640 --> 34:48.039
Not onher phone.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.945
She wasn't onher phone?Right. We used

34:50.000 --> 34:52.127
Dropoutjeep to turn her phone
into a hot mic.

34:52.170 --> 34:54.252
We can broadcast
anything within 20 feet.

34:54.300 --> 34:57.042
So what are you saying?She wasn't the leak.

34:57.090 --> 34:58.216
So who was?We don't know.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.134
Maybe nobody.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.136
Shut up, J.He may be right.

35:01.180 --> 35:03.910
There's a chance
this could be in-house.

35:03.970 --> 35:06.928
We were listening in.
The two of us.

35:06.970 --> 35:10.224
Not to the confidential session,
but outside.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.788
[passionate breathing]

35:14.850 --> 35:16.147
Oh...

35:16.200 --> 35:18.145
What was that?

35:18.200 --> 35:20.156
Sorry.Alicia's having sex

35:20.200 --> 35:21.371
with the investigator.

35:21.420 --> 35:24.196
Ah, great.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.763
Here we go.

35:25.810 --> 35:27.289
HICKS: I think you might
want to come inside.

35:27.340 --> 35:29.023
We're reviewing
Lance Hopper's statements.

35:29.080 --> 35:32.038
_ So that was sent around
internally here?Mm-hmm. Yeah.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.810
And we think that
was the leak. Not Alicia.

35:34.870 --> 35:36.952
So who's in the
loop around here?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.218
Everybody at CMI level.

35:39.260 --> 35:40.431
All right.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.266
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

35:42.310 --> 35:44.175
But hold off on
listening further.

35:44.220 --> 35:46.040
What do you mean? Why?

35:46.100 --> 35:48.045
Because I asked you to.

35:48.100 --> 35:49.397
Yeah, but we didn't
do anything wrong.

35:49.450 --> 35:51.008
Who said you did
something wrong?

35:51.060 --> 35:54.359
Just hold off
until I get back to you.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.753
You guys
screwed up.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.791
Shut up, J.Shut up, J.

35:59.850 --> 36:01.408
Is there a problem?

36:01.460 --> 36:02.495
MICHAEL:
An enormous one.

36:02.550 --> 36:04.108
The FBI is circling
the governor.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.240
You can't tell us why.

36:05.290 --> 36:06.245
Even though you know.

36:06.290 --> 36:09.282
So we're stuck
chasing ghosts.

36:09.340 --> 36:12.332
I need you to take
Tom until I can

36:12.380 --> 36:13.688
get my arms around this thing.

36:13.730 --> 36:14.947
Of course.

36:14.990 --> 36:16.901
Mm... [kissing]

36:16.950 --> 36:18.258
I'm sorry
I can't be more help,

36:18.300 --> 36:19.551
but I have a client
to protect here, too.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.123
ELI:
For what it's worth,

36:21.170 --> 36:22.956
tell your client their phone's
probably being tapped.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.730
Meaning?We just heard the FBI

36:25.790 --> 36:27.303
tapped Peter's phones.

36:27.350 --> 36:28.692
If they're listening
to the governor,

36:28.750 --> 36:31.878
they're listening to everyone.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.263
You're trying
to make me paranoid.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.220
No.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.793
Not you. Him.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.274
Now that you've told me,
I have to warn my client.

36:40.320 --> 36:43.369
It's my fiduciary responsibility
as his lavwer.

36:43.410 --> 36:47.323
Even if it's a lie, I can't risk
putting him in jeopardy.

36:47.370 --> 36:49.326
But I can't call

36:49.380 --> 36:50.586
my client, so I have to

36:50.640 --> 36:53.200
goto my client.

36:53.250 --> 36:55.377
But if I goto my client,

36:55.430 --> 36:57.159
you'll follow me.

36:57.210 --> 36:58.336
Or you'll stake out

36:58.390 --> 37:00.460
this office.We're just trying to help.

37:00.520 --> 37:03.865
So that's a good move.

37:03.910 --> 37:06.435
Now how do I move around it?

37:06.480 --> 37:07.822
Hmm? [kissing]

37:07.870 --> 37:09.565
Or do I?

37:09.610 --> 37:11.259
God, you're good at this.

37:11.310 --> 37:13.619
Or do I avoid
your tail?

37:13.660 --> 37:15.389
That should be easy.

37:15.450 --> 37:18.408
Okay, I'm heading out.I'll-I'll join you.

37:18.450 --> 37:19.872
[kisses] Yeah?

37:21.320 --> 37:23.788
MARISSA:
So the dog has a GPS collar?Indeed.

37:23.850 --> 37:25.624
I bought it a week ago.It's all part of

37:25.670 --> 37:27.581
the master plan.Is the dot not moving

37:27.630 --> 37:29.803
part of the
master plan?

37:29.850 --> 37:32.717
Hm. The pergola.
Garfield Park.

37:32.770 --> 37:35.853
I love that spot.That's where I proposed.

37:35.900 --> 37:38.152
Elsbeth's sending a message,

37:38.210 --> 37:40.724
leaving his collar there.
[chuckles softly]

37:40.780 --> 37:43.294
Guess it probably
wasn't that hard,

37:43.340 --> 37:44.819
on a dog his size.

37:44.870 --> 37:46.167
It was a very big collar.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.869
So wait, if the op is blown,

37:47.910 --> 37:49.434
why do you two look so smug?

37:49.480 --> 37:52.472
A]: One should always
look smug, and B]:

37:52.530 --> 37:54.691
It's exactly what we wanted
Elsbeth to do.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.308
MICHAEL: She thinks
she's shaken her tail.

37:56.360 --> 37:58.521
Now she's let
her guard down

37:58.580 --> 38:01.048
and she won't
notice her real tail.

38:01.100 --> 38:02.055
[phone buzzing]

38:02.100 --> 38:03.055
[phone beeps]

38:03.100 --> 38:04.055
Hey.

38:04.100 --> 38:05.146
ELI:
You got her?

38:05.190 --> 38:06.532
JASON: I got her.

38:06.580 --> 38:08.309
[phone beeps off]

38:08.370 --> 38:11.271
JASON: I followed Elsbeth
from Garfield Park

38:11.330 --> 38:13.150
mamm
on Randolph.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.235
She hates that diner.

38:14.290 --> 38:16.281
They have paella.

38:16.330 --> 38:18.855
She had a bad experience
with paella.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.378
[groans]
Ten minutes later,

38:22.430 --> 38:25.979
this guy comes in
and sits down with her.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.258
Wait, wait that one.

38:28.300 --> 38:29.779
Yeah.

38:29.820 --> 38:31.959
JASON:
His name is Lloyd Garber.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.514
I followed him to his office
on Michigan. Turns out

38:34.570 --> 38:36.606
he owns the whole building.MARISSA: He owns
a lot more than that.

38:36.660 --> 38:37.604
MICHAEL: You know him?

38:37.660 --> 38:39.309
Yeah, he's...

38:39.360 --> 38:40.748
Dairy.Dairy.

38:40.790 --> 38:42.314
That's how she figured it out.

38:42.360 --> 38:43.964
MARISSA: Garber owns
a dairy farm in Israel.

38:44.010 --> 38:45.489
He's the one who got me my job.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.223
Elsbeth just connected the dots.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.054
And that's the name she redacted
from her client list?

38:49.100 --> 38:50.237
Yeah, so that's not good.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.236
They're coming after Peter

38:52.280 --> 38:54.271
andone of his donors.

38:54.330 --> 38:55.365
Yup.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.320
Now it's time
to go on the attack.

39:05.770 --> 39:08.204
REPORTER: The Pentagon confirmed
today that a U.S. drone strike

39:08.250 --> 39:10.901
killed Massoud Tahan,
an ISIS operative

39:10.950 --> 39:13.123
linked to the terror attack
at a cartoon drawing contest

39:13.170 --> 39:15.161
in Garland, Texas.

39:22.010 --> 39:24.228
You're back from your
secret mission.

39:24.270 --> 39:26.090
Yup.

39:26.140 --> 39:28.392
I heard things here
are getting a bit crazy.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.793
I thought bond court
was a jungle, but wow.

39:30.840 --> 39:33.365
Best thing to do--
stay on the sidelines.

39:33.410 --> 39:34.889
We could just leave.

39:34.930 --> 39:36.716
We could.

39:36.760 --> 39:37.840
But money.

39:37.890 --> 39:39.198
Money.

39:40.370 --> 39:41.712
Do you know where Jason is?

39:41.770 --> 39:43.328
Why?

39:43.380 --> 39:44.677
Just curious.

39:44.730 --> 39:47.244
The three of us
against the world.

39:47.290 --> 39:48.814
Hey. You're back.

39:48.860 --> 39:49.815
Yup.

39:49.860 --> 39:51.509
They didn't need me anymore.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.516
And she can't tell us
who "they" are.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.733
Mm-hmm.
It's top secret.

39:55.780 --> 39:57.338
So, it's been fun here, huh?

39:57.390 --> 40:00.086
Yeah, a gender war.

40:00.130 --> 40:02.121
Jason, do you have a minute?

40:02.180 --> 40:03.738
I do.

40:03.790 --> 40:05.439
I'll leave you two.

40:05.490 --> 40:06.525
Nice to have you back.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.878
Good to be back.

40:10.140 --> 40:11.357
You want me to close the door?

40:11.400 --> 40:12.958
Yeah. Glass walls.

40:13.010 --> 40:14.409
We have to get used to them.

40:16.710 --> 40:18.530
So...

40:18.590 --> 40:20.490
things are complicated
between us now.

40:20.540 --> 40:22.622
What do you mean?

40:22.680 --> 40:24.329
I remember high school.

40:24.370 --> 40:27.112
I remember my phone calls
being ignored.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.549
I am not ignoring anything.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.591
Ijust...

40:37.130 --> 40:40.213
I don't like not knowing
what the situation is.

40:40.260 --> 40:42.478
What situation?

40:42.520 --> 40:44.568
Look, it's not like you're
married to the corner grocer.

40:44.610 --> 40:47.078
All right?
It's the governor.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.562
And that's myproblem.

40:48.620 --> 40:51.487
No. My problem too.

40:51.530 --> 40:53.395
He accepts it.No, he doesn't.

40:53.450 --> 40:55.486
He may say it,
but no one accepts it.

40:55.540 --> 40:56.484
Okay.

40:56.540 --> 40:58.485
I accept it.

40:58.540 --> 41:01.441
And...

41:01.500 --> 41:03.229
you kept me from drinking.

41:05.590 --> 41:08.457
If you don't come
to me tonight, who knows?

41:09.590 --> 41:12.468
Maybe I'll start drinking again.

41:14.250 --> 41:16.468
Way to make me feel guilty.

41:19.560 --> 41:22.518
You want things simple,
I want things simple, too.

41:24.300 --> 41:26.291
So here it is:

41:27.610 --> 41:29.384
I want you again.

41:33.490 --> 41:35.481
Don't you want it?

41:43.970 --> 41:45.881
JASON:
I want it.

41:45.930 --> 41:48.626
ALICIA: Would you like me
to tell you exactly...

41:48.680 --> 41:50.329
FOYLE:
Mr. Hopkins.

41:50.370 --> 41:51.928
I need you
to come with us.

41:51.980 --> 41:53.891
HOPKINS:
Why? What's wrong?

41:53.940 --> 41:55.931
FOYLE: We just need to ask you
a few questions, that's all.

41:55.990 --> 41:57.469
HOPKINS: I was permitted
to use the hot mic.

41:57.510 --> 41:59.558
I know.
Please come with us.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.680
I didn't leak anything.Good.

42:00.730 --> 42:02.243
Then there shouldn't
be any problem here.

42:02.300 --> 42:05.201
I just sent the recording
to the system admin. Stephen...

42:05.260 --> 42:06.511
Hey, I'm just working here.

42:08.390 --> 42:10.824
I need this job.

42:10.870 --> 42:13.043
I got tagged for the hot mic.

42:13.090 --> 42:15.001
It doesn't mean I leaked.FOYLE: Good.

42:15.050 --> 42:17.610
Then there shouldn't
be a problem.

42:28.980 --> 42:31.619
[J whistling "Taps"]

42:31.670 --> 42:33.809
Shut up, J.

42:33.850 --> 42:35.408
Hey, I just
sent you something.

42:35.460 --> 42:37.542
Take a look.

42:37.590 --> 42:39.546
[cracking, rumbling]
