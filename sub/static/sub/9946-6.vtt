Tickets this
way for the Chatsworth Express.

00:07.010 --> 00:10.729
Come and watch
pikeys making a mess of the lives

00:10.730 --> 00:13.969
they were given by 'im upstairs.

00:13.970 --> 00:17.969
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:17.970 --> 00:19.009
Stay away!

00:19.010 --> 00:21.569
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace...

00:21.570 --> 00:22.129
Oi!

00:22.130 --> 00:25.129
Oi!
..kids needing money,
or wives in your face.

00:25.130 --> 00:25.689
(BARKS)

00:25.690 --> 00:29.489
(BARKS)
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included, is why pubs

00:29.490 --> 00:33.249
and drugs were kindly invented.

00:33.250 --> 00:37.209
To calm us all down.
To stop us going mental.

00:37.210 --> 00:40.649
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:40.650 --> 00:41.449
Woah!

00:41.450 --> 00:45.449
Woah!
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes!

00:46.090 --> 00:48.209
You shit on our head,

00:48.210 --> 00:51.569
but you pay the taxes! (LAUGHS)

00:51.570 --> 00:53.529
(LAUGHS)

00:53.530 --> 00:57.049
Imagine a Britain without
Chatsworth buccaneers,

00:57.050 --> 00:59.329
who'd cum on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:59.330 --> 01:02.289
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:02.290 --> 01:03.809
(LAUGHS)

01:03.810 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:07.050 --> 01:11.049

OPERA CD PLAYS

01:21.770 --> 01:25.769
PADDY: 'They say it's about duty,
this fatherhood thing. And love.

01:26.370 --> 01:30.369
'Being there for them in
times of need.'

01:30.370 --> 01:33.849
'Well, I've done my duty and
proved my love, time and again.

01:33.850 --> 01:36.049
'Happily, no question.

01:36.050 --> 01:39.049
'But what happens when your duty's
done, when they don't need you

01:39.050 --> 01:43.049
'any more and all that's left
is the knackers' yard?'

01:43.450 --> 01:45.369
'What happens then?'

01:45.370 --> 01:47.889
(LAUGHS)

01:47.890 --> 01:50.209
'Who could blame a man for wondering

01:50.210 --> 01:53.009
'what different roads he might have
taken?

01:53.010 --> 01:55.209
'And who'd begrudge him a second stab
at happiness

01:55.210 --> 01:57.209
'if he was lucky enough to be
given a chance?'

01:57.210 --> 02:00.729
(SWITCHES OF CD)

02:00.730 --> 02:04.729
Thank fuck for that.
Me head's splitting.

02:05.130 --> 02:09.128
I know all this is a
bit, er, unexpected.

02:10.090 --> 02:12.809
I'm grateful to you all for coming.

02:12.810 --> 02:14.649
Thing is, there's
something I need to tell you.

02:14.650 --> 02:15.849
Thing is, there's
something I need to tell you.
You're not dying are you?

02:15.850 --> 02:19.849
He's coming out of the closet.
(GIGGLES)

02:21.570 --> 02:25.569
I've met someone.

02:28.330 --> 02:30.369
Her name's D'reen. D'reen Savage.

02:30.370 --> 02:33.449
Sounds like a drag act.

02:33.450 --> 02:35.089
We're going to live together.

02:35.090 --> 02:38.449
That's what all this is in aid
of, to tell us you're moving

02:38.450 --> 02:42.449
some floozy in? Should have saved
your energyand our time.

02:42.770 --> 02:46.769
Please, Mimi. Please?

02:50.250 --> 02:53.249
No. I'm moving out.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.689
Where to?

02:54.690 --> 02:58.689
We haven't decided yet. But away
from here. Maybe as far as Wilmslow.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.769
And what's going to happen
to the family business

03:02.770 --> 03:04.489
when you sail off into the sunset?

03:04.490 --> 03:08.489
You can have it. Run it between yous.
A parting gift.

03:11.530 --> 03:13.249
You're not going to just sit here
and listen to this bollocks are you?

03:13.250 --> 03:14.849
You're not going to just sit here
and listen to this bollocks are you?
What do you want me to do?

03:14.850 --> 03:18.569
Well, tell him you want him back!

03:18.570 --> 03:22.569
Well, give it another go!

03:51.570 --> 03:55.569
I'll stick the kettle on.

03:56.130 --> 03:59.289
What happened to the kitchen?!

03:59.290 --> 04:02.969
I put it in the washing machine
and it shrank(!) Bailiffs.

04:02.970 --> 04:04.769
We're behind on the HP payments.

04:04.770 --> 04:07.369
What the fuck are we buying on HP?

04:07.370 --> 04:11.369
Telly, DVD, washer, fridge,
cooker, microwave, carpet.

04:12.570 --> 04:16.369
You, whatever your name is.
First rule. Tell him.

04:16.370 --> 04:18.569
Never let the bailiffs in.

04:18.570 --> 04:21.728
I showed you them. I tried to
get you to do something about then

04:21.730 --> 04:23.329
and you weren't interested!

04:23.330 --> 04:27.329
So now they've handed the debts
over to the bailiffs. We've got 21

04:27.690 --> 04:31.689
days to raise the money we owe,
then we can get our stuff back.

04:31.930 --> 04:35.929
You have turned into one
massive disappointment!

04:51.210 --> 04:55.209
FLOOR BOARDS CREAK

04:59.330 --> 05:01.929
Mimi,
it's four o'clock in the morning.

05:01.930 --> 05:05.929
We need to talk about Roscoe.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.049
What about him?

05:07.050 --> 05:08.849
He's been sniffing round The Jockey.

05:08.850 --> 05:12.809
He's been sniffing round The Jockey.
No way. We've an agreement.

05:12.810 --> 05:16.729
He stays off The Chatsworth, I
stay out of Moss Side. It's a truce.

05:16.730 --> 05:18.409
Based on what?

05:18.410 --> 05:21.009
Go on and do it. Go on!

05:21.010 --> 05:25.009
Based on a Cold War doctrine
of mutually assured destruction.

05:34.010 --> 05:36.969
Roscoe and Glasgow
McRae have made a deal.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.849
Roscoe supplies McRae with cocaine

05:39.850 --> 05:43.169
and McRae supplies him
with a lot of money.

05:43.170 --> 05:47.169
150 grand.

05:47.170 --> 05:48.689
And you're going to rob it.

05:48.690 --> 05:51.089
(SCOFFS) Mimi, listen, I'm not...

05:51.090 --> 05:53.489
No, you listen to me.

05:53.490 --> 05:56.089
Apart from Micky nobody wants
to take over the business.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.849
This is it for the Maguires.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.889
The final curtain.

05:59.890 --> 06:02.249
And the way I see it,
it's the least you can do

06:02.250 --> 06:04.009
to leave us financially secure.

06:04.010 --> 06:05.729
Do that and you can go.

06:05.730 --> 06:09.729
Think of it as a combined
retirement fund for yours truly

06:10.690 --> 06:14.209
and a start up fund
for your children.

06:14.210 --> 06:17.849
I've kept Roscoe away
from you and the boys.

06:17.850 --> 06:21.729
He doesn't know them.

06:21.730 --> 06:24.689
But once he can identify them,

06:24.690 --> 06:26.929
once they've

06:26.930 --> 06:30.929
taken 150 grand from him...

06:31.370 --> 06:35.369
he's going to come looking.

06:35.650 --> 06:39.649
Not necessarily.

06:40.090 --> 06:44.089
You should've buried him years ago.

06:51.130 --> 06:54.809
Breakfast of champions.

06:54.810 --> 06:57.649
All contributions are
welcome, Frank.

06:57.650 --> 06:58.609
Even yours, believe it or not.

06:58.610 --> 07:00.569
Even yours, believe it or not.
Clear off. Charity begins at home.

07:00.570 --> 07:02.929
That's what it's for, you plonker.

07:02.930 --> 07:06.089
Your home. Buy you a kettle
and some cups and stuff.

07:06.090 --> 07:08.609
Who said community was dead?

07:08.610 --> 07:10.049
Any chance of a sub? I said I'd...

07:10.050 --> 07:14.049
Any chance of a sub? I said I'd...
No, there isn't.

07:20.250 --> 07:20.689
Come on we're going.

07:20.690 --> 07:24.689
Come on we're going.
What?

07:26.490 --> 07:30.489
Pint, please, Mimi,
and an orange juice.

07:30.930 --> 07:32.969
Oh, my God!
Well, what did you expect?

07:32.970 --> 07:36.969
You've hurt his pride, dented his
fragile masculinity.

07:37.930 --> 07:41.929
Then you come in here
all lovey-dovey, flaunting the fact.

07:42.010 --> 07:44.009
We're not flaunting anything.

07:44.010 --> 07:46.849
Well, it's not how he sees it is it.

07:46.850 --> 07:50.849
Here you go. Don't let your dad get
his hands on it.

07:51.330 --> 07:55.329
Thanks.

07:56.850 --> 07:59.889
Go on then. Roscoe. Are we in?

07:59.890 --> 08:00.689
Too fucking right we're in.

08:00.690 --> 08:04.409
Too fucking right we're in.
Not me. This is my life right here.

08:04.410 --> 08:07.329
How scary is this Roscoe guy?

08:07.330 --> 08:11.089
Yeah, but think of what
we can do with dosh.

08:11.090 --> 08:15.089
We'll get you off your back at
Lillian's, open a place of our own.

08:16.730 --> 08:20.729
We're in.

08:22.490 --> 08:24.329
Where's Connor?

08:24.330 --> 08:27.009
Asleep. You'll have to watch him.
I'm going swimming.

08:27.010 --> 08:28.289
Swimming?!

08:28.290 --> 08:31.249
What's wrong, Jamie? Can't he spend
a bit of time with his dad?

08:31.250 --> 08:33.729
Not when his dad's pulling
pints behind the bar he can't, no.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.208
Not when his dad's pulling
pints behind the bar he can't, no.
Looked to me like you were chatting.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.609
Or should I say planning?

08:36.610 --> 08:40.609
I retired from the family
business way back and you know that.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.769
I'm not going back,
that's a promise.

08:48.730 --> 08:52.729
MOBILE BEEPS

09:19.530 --> 09:21.409
Come on, come on, leave it,
leave it!

09:21.410 --> 09:24.449
Come on, come on, lucky dice!

09:24.450 --> 09:27.889
THEY GROAN

09:27.890 --> 09:30.089
Try again.
Double up, double up. Come on.

09:30.090 --> 09:33.089
All right, Liam? Fancy a flutter?
Got 50 quid in the pot here

09:33.090 --> 09:34.609
on the dice. Fiver minimum.

09:34.610 --> 09:37.129
Yeah, all right.

09:37.130 --> 09:41.129
Ten down, ten down,
come on let's see your money.

09:41.930 --> 09:44.489
Come on. Here we go.
Are you ready for the eight?

09:44.490 --> 09:45.529
All right let's have quiet.

09:45.530 --> 09:48.689
All right let's have quiet.
Come on. Seven.

09:48.690 --> 09:49.569
Yes!

09:49.570 --> 09:53.569
Yes!
You lucky bastard!

09:55.970 --> 09:59.969
Hang about, Liam.

10:06.610 --> 10:10.409
It's too much for me, man.

10:10.410 --> 10:14.409
Nah, I'm out.

10:16.090 --> 10:18.689
Are you bluffing?!

10:18.690 --> 10:22.689
You are, aren't you?

10:26.170 --> 10:27.449
Can you lend me some more money?

10:27.450 --> 10:29.249
You're skinning me here.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.249
I'll give it back once I've won.

10:30.250 --> 10:34.249
I'll give it back once I've won.
THEY LAUGH

10:44.490 --> 10:48.489
Fuck!

10:49.130 --> 10:53.129
You weren't bluffing.

10:58.250 --> 11:02.249
But I was.

11:03.610 --> 11:06.289
Sorry Liam, you lose.

11:06.290 --> 11:09.369
I can lend you some more money
if you're still feeling lucky.

11:09.370 --> 11:12.369
Chalk this one up to
experience then, yeah?

11:12.370 --> 11:14.929
What about the extra hundred?

11:14.930 --> 11:18.929
It was a loan. Pay me back whenever.

11:21.210 --> 11:25.209
Say, erm, Wednesday?

11:51.850 --> 11:55.849
Oh, my God.

12:09.290 --> 12:12.649
I wanted to see
if she actually existed.

12:12.650 --> 12:16.049
Here you go.

12:16.050 --> 12:19.929
Congratulations.
I know, we're through to the finals.

12:19.930 --> 12:22.209
You should have said
Mimi was coming.

12:22.210 --> 12:24.809
I didn't know.

12:24.810 --> 12:28.809
I saw him coming in.Well,
it's lovely to finally meet ya.
Patrick's told me so much about ya.

12:29.730 --> 12:33.569
And you must have an ex somewhere
in your murky past, Doreen?

12:33.570 --> 12:35.089
Divorced. A long time ago.

12:35.090 --> 12:36.649
Kids?No way.

12:36.650 --> 12:39.729
I'm far too selfish, too
wrapped up in the arts, you know.

12:39.730 --> 12:42.009
Theatre and opera.

12:42.010 --> 12:44.569
Although my first love is the salsa.

12:44.570 --> 12:46.689
Or itwasme first love.

12:46.690 --> 12:50.689
There's an old Cuban saying, right,
that's where it's from, the salsa,

12:50.810 --> 12:54.569
that when you're on your knees and
your heart's broken in two,

12:54.570 --> 12:58.569
that's when the spirit of salsa
comes in and it finds you
and it heals you.

13:00.450 --> 13:02.969
So where did you two meet?

13:02.970 --> 13:05.289
Community centre, of all places.

13:05.290 --> 13:09.289
D'reen was giving dance
lessons for the rejected
and the terminally needy.Nice!

13:12.810 --> 13:16.809
I'll just go
to the little girls' room.

13:17.010 --> 13:18.929
None of this was done
to make you jealous.

13:18.930 --> 13:22.289
There's an old Liverpool saying,
Paddy,

13:22.290 --> 13:26.289
that "when you've got your head
too far up your arse, you
won't smell the shit any more".

13:27.010 --> 13:29.329
This is your mid-life crisis,
not mine.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.369
Time for a reality check.

13:31.370 --> 13:34.049
Reality's OK for a holiday
but you wouldn't want to live there.

13:34.050 --> 13:38.049
All I want from you is to make sure
my boys are ready to handle Roscoe
and whoever comes after him!

13:47.810 --> 13:49.609
It won't be subtle.

13:49.610 --> 13:51.169
Subtle won't do with Roscoe.

13:51.170 --> 13:54.929
So we're going to
proper work him over then?

13:54.930 --> 13:58.929
A bit more final than that, son.

13:59.330 --> 14:02.969
If he sees your faces, you'll be
marked men. It'll be him or you.

14:02.970 --> 14:06.249
So we go in armed to the teeth and
we go in brutal.

14:06.250 --> 14:10.249
And for that I need to know
that you can handle a gun.

14:12.090 --> 14:14.409
Load it, aim it, and make it safe.

14:14.410 --> 14:18.409
Other way!

14:19.370 --> 14:22.369
Breach it.

14:22.370 --> 14:26.369
Hang on a minute, you want to, er...

14:26.410 --> 14:28.769
Fucking hell!

14:28.770 --> 14:32.769
I said aim, not fucking shoot!

14:36.130 --> 14:39.609
Fuck!

14:39.610 --> 14:42.329
What the hell was I thinking?

14:42.330 --> 14:46.329
Right... From here on, you two
just concentrate on surveillance.

14:46.930 --> 14:50.569
Oh, what?I want to know who
Roscoe meets, where he goes.

14:50.570 --> 14:54.369
People, places, times. Got it?

14:54.370 --> 14:58.369
Got it?!Yes.

15:00.610 --> 15:02.209
And remember,

15:02.210 --> 15:03.889
keep a low profile.

15:03.890 --> 15:07.889
I heard, right, that he tore the
heart out of some guy's chest
with his bare hands and ate it.

15:13.410 --> 15:15.089
While it was still beating.

15:15.090 --> 15:17.569
Why?How the fuck should I know?

15:17.570 --> 15:21.569
He's a psycho. >

15:43.690 --> 15:47.689
Fuck!

15:47.690 --> 15:51.689
Has he gone?Yeah.

16:05.890 --> 16:09.889
PHONE VIBRATES

16:28.770 --> 16:29.449
Haven't seen you for a while.

16:29.450 --> 16:32.929
I thought that was how you wanted
it. Playing happy families.

16:32.930 --> 16:34.849
Doesn't mean I never want to see ya.

16:34.850 --> 16:37.329
It's all too complicated for me.

16:37.330 --> 16:41.329
When you want me -
and I mean want me -

16:41.610 --> 16:45.569
you know where I am.

16:45.570 --> 16:49.569
You can have him if you want
for an hour.

16:50.370 --> 16:54.369
Not very nice,
considering he's yours.

17:00.090 --> 17:03.569
How come you try
and off-load him all the time?

17:03.570 --> 17:05.449
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:05.450 --> 17:09.449
Yeah you do. Every time you
look at him it reminds you...

17:09.569 --> 17:13.569
You were shagging me every chance
you got and you fucking loved it

17:14.290 --> 17:17.729
and then you went home and lied
to poor old Jamie

17:17.730 --> 17:20.729
and now
it's eating away at ya, the guilt.

17:20.730 --> 17:23.648
Cos you want to do it again.
Don't ya?

17:23.650 --> 17:27.648
Fuck you, Joe.Anytime.

17:39.810 --> 17:42.329
You know what,
this thing with me dad.

17:42.330 --> 17:44.769
The dancing. This woman he's met.

17:44.770 --> 17:46.569
Nah, it won't last.

17:46.570 --> 17:49.009
Mam says it's a mid-life crisis.

17:49.010 --> 17:52.569
Y'know some blokes grow a pony tail.

17:52.570 --> 17:56.569
Or buy a huge motor bike
what they can't even drive.

18:01.570 --> 18:04.089
I need a piss.

18:04.090 --> 18:08.089
MOBILE RINGS

18:10.410 --> 18:14.409
McRae, how's Glasgow?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.729
It's always fucking freezing
up there, innit?

18:20.730 --> 18:24.729
The land the sun forgot.

18:30.290 --> 18:34.049
Tomorrow night, eight o'clock.

18:34.050 --> 18:37.249
Ferry Road. The old warehouse.

18:37.250 --> 18:41.249
Do you know it?

18:45.090 --> 18:49.089
The lads haven't got satnav.

18:52.450 --> 18:54.409
Caught you...

18:54.410 --> 18:58.409
Giving me the eye.

18:58.450 --> 19:02.009
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck!

19:02.010 --> 19:06.009
Nah, mate.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.769
We're leaving.What?

19:13.770 --> 19:17.769
Now!

19:46.210 --> 19:48.569
Oi! Get your sticky fingers
out of my till.

19:48.570 --> 19:50.289
You thieving little toe-rag!

19:50.290 --> 19:52.569
Joe, I wasn't!Yes, you were!
Are you in on this?

19:52.570 --> 19:54.289
What you on about?Hands off.

19:54.290 --> 19:58.289
Get off me.Let him go.

20:04.890 --> 20:06.809
I wasn't stealing.He saw ya!

20:06.810 --> 20:08.769
I saw ya.

20:08.770 --> 20:12.769
Liam...

20:15.250 --> 20:18.049
Thanks again, I promise
you it'll be sorted.Good.

20:18.050 --> 20:22.049
OK, bye.Bye.

20:26.530 --> 20:30.529
A truancy officer?

20:31.330 --> 20:33.689
Look, I should be at work.

20:33.690 --> 20:37.689
I only popped out to get some veg,
so stop messing me about and talk.

20:37.690 --> 20:41.569
I'm always late cos I have
to look after Stella and Dad.

20:41.570 --> 20:45.009
When you're late, you get detention
and that means I'm home late

20:45.010 --> 20:48.249
and that causes even more trouble
with Stella and Dad.

20:48.250 --> 20:52.249
So it's easier not to go in.
And does Frank know about this?

20:53.210 --> 20:57.209
Don't tell him!

20:57.450 --> 21:01.449
Let me.

21:03.010 --> 21:05.129
Why did you have your hands
in Joe's till.

21:05.130 --> 21:09.129
I needed money.

21:14.170 --> 21:16.649
How much do you owe?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.969
Liam.

21:18.970 --> 21:22.969
I borrowed 50 but when the interest
kicked in it turned into 1,500.

21:23.450 --> 21:27.449
Now it's more
and I don't know what to do.

21:51.890 --> 21:55.889
Er, D'reen,
let me introduce you to my boys.

21:56.850 --> 22:00.849
Shane, Micky. D'reen.

22:01.290 --> 22:05.289
Hiya.

22:05.890 --> 22:09.889
Micky.

22:11.810 --> 22:15.809
I shouldn't have come.

22:16.130 --> 22:17.729
No, stay.

22:17.730 --> 22:21.729
I don't want to be in the middle of
you and your family, Patrick.
I'll sort it.

22:24.650 --> 22:28.089
Show some respect!

22:28.090 --> 22:30.289
Dad, about Roscoe.He's a Hodgie.

22:30.290 --> 22:32.129
What?He plays the pink oboe.

22:32.130 --> 22:35.329
He's a receiver of swollen goods.
Will you shut the fuck up?

22:35.330 --> 22:39.329
What the fuck's he talking about?
He's gay.Gay?

22:39.730 --> 22:42.369
I was at his wedding
and at his wife's funeral.

22:42.370 --> 22:44.289
He was in a gay bar.
He probably didn't realise.

22:44.290 --> 22:47.209
He shoved his cock at me
through a hole in a bog wall!

22:47.210 --> 22:48.809
What the fuck were you doing?
That's not the point!

22:48.810 --> 22:52.809
The point is the deal is
happening tomorrow, 8 o'clock.

22:54.370 --> 22:57.249
Is this some kind of a wind up?No.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.649
You actually heard him say it?

22:59.650 --> 23:03.649
Eight o'clock?Yeah.

23:12.770 --> 23:15.449
I can't make it.What?

23:15.450 --> 23:17.689
I've promised to be
somewhere with D'reen.

23:17.690 --> 23:19.449
I'm sorry.

23:19.450 --> 23:23.449
You're on your own.

23:30.290 --> 23:34.289
If you could be anywhere in the
world right now, anywhere at all,
where would you be?

23:36.290 --> 23:39.009
Where?

23:39.010 --> 23:43.009
Here.

23:43.130 --> 23:46.289
You happy?

23:46.290 --> 23:50.289
Happier, I think,
than I've ever been in my life.

23:51.610 --> 23:54.809
We're good together.

23:54.810 --> 23:57.289
Is your passport up to date?

23:57.290 --> 23:59.049
I think so.

23:59.050 --> 24:03.049
I don't belong here Patrick,
not deep down, not in me soul,
and neither do you.

24:04.370 --> 24:08.369
We need the heat and the colour
and the mystery.

24:08.450 --> 24:12.449
I want us to go to Cuba.

24:15.730 --> 24:19.449
We could get a late deal,
fortnight all inclusive?

24:19.450 --> 24:23.449
I was thinking
the rest of our lives.

24:30.130 --> 24:34.129
I don't love him.

24:34.350 --> 24:36.949
Of course you love him.

24:36.950 --> 24:39.829
You're just tired.
Things'll get easier.

24:39.830 --> 24:41.549
No,

24:41.550 --> 24:45.549
I look at him and I
don't even recognise him.

24:46.710 --> 24:48.669
I'm not seeing him,

24:48.670 --> 24:50.429
seeing stuff.

24:50.430 --> 24:54.429
What sort of stuff?

24:58.030 --> 25:01.549
Thoughts. Bad thoughts.

25:01.550 --> 25:02.829
KNOCK AT DOOR

25:02.830 --> 25:06.829
Go away!

25:10.870 --> 25:13.789
You all right?

25:13.790 --> 25:16.229
Karen?

25:16.230 --> 25:20.229
She's fine! >

25:26.870 --> 25:30.869
Look, son...

25:32.310 --> 25:36.309
I know how you feel about coming in
on the Roscoe job and I respect that
but hear me out...

25:39.030 --> 25:42.269
Believe me I wouldn't be here if
there were any other way

25:42.270 --> 25:46.269
but I can't trust Micky
and Shane with this.

25:48.070 --> 25:50.269
Roscoe'll eat them for breakfast.

25:50.270 --> 25:52.629
Why what's happened?

25:52.630 --> 25:55.109
I'm in the final of the salsa
dancing championship

25:55.110 --> 25:59.109
tonight at eight with D'reen.

26:03.230 --> 26:04.869
So blow her out, dad.

26:04.870 --> 26:05.989
I can't.

26:05.990 --> 26:08.709
Well, call the job off.

26:08.710 --> 26:12.709
Then I'm letting the family down
and your mother.

26:12.830 --> 26:15.069
She'll never let me
hear the last of it.

26:15.070 --> 26:19.069
Fuck's sake!

26:28.470 --> 26:29.749
I want my money.

26:29.750 --> 26:31.389
You said Wednesday.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.709
You've got till tonight,
do you understand?

26:33.710 --> 26:36.389
Midnight,
then I'll come looking for ya.

26:36.390 --> 26:40.389
Empty your pockets.

26:42.310 --> 26:43.669
All right give us your bag.

26:43.670 --> 26:47.669
Why?

26:50.790 --> 26:52.269
They're the school's.

26:52.270 --> 26:56.269
Collateral. You can have
'em back when you've paid me.

27:04.110 --> 27:06.789
Listen, Jamie...
Tell me to mind my own, yeah,

27:06.790 --> 27:10.389
but I saw Karen yesterday
and she didn't look too bright.

27:10.390 --> 27:12.829
To be honest I was
a bit worried about her.

27:12.830 --> 27:14.229
I don't think she's coping.

27:14.230 --> 27:18.229
Don't worry about it. She's fine.

27:18.750 --> 27:22.749
Jamie...

27:24.910 --> 27:28.069
Your dad talked you round then?
You OK with it all?

27:28.070 --> 27:29.229
Fine.

27:29.230 --> 27:33.149
If you get caught,
you go down, you don't come back.

27:33.150 --> 27:37.149
Don't worry, I'll make sure
there's no witnesses, yeah.

27:38.790 --> 27:42.789
Yes, love?

27:54.710 --> 27:57.709
Yeah, I've just seen
a guy nicking a car.

27:57.710 --> 28:00.549

28:00.550 --> 28:04.549

28:12.630 --> 28:16.629

the walls with that shit.

28:20.590 --> 28:22.869
Give McRae my best, tell him

28:22.870 --> 28:26.869
he's welcome in Moss Side anytime,
as my guest.

28:27.870 --> 28:31.869

31:55.670 --> 31:58.189
You're running away
to join the Taleban?

31:58.190 --> 32:01.149
I can't look after you and
Stella on my own. It's not fair.

32:01.150 --> 32:02.429
