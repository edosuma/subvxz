[Angus] Hey, hey, Todd.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.391

you a question, mate.

02:11.599 --> 02:14.166
I believe someone
who has had a-- [chuckling] No.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.835
Someone who's had a little
more success, uh, was Angus.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.270
-[man] Theo!
-[Angus] Okay.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.873

-[Angus] Oh,
all right, all right.
-So many to choose from.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.684
So many beautiful young faces.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.352
Todd's trying to get away.

Todd, I'm not going to

03:59.473 --> 04:01.406
-Come on, come on.
-No, come on, please.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.407
Please stop him.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.843
-We don't know what
he's going to do.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.452
Yes, here she comes!

04:13.454 --> 04:15.921
[Hannah] Whoa, look at your
tattoos, what do they mean?

04:15.923 --> 04:18.257
Uh, that is a secret society.

04:18.259 --> 04:20.525
-What?
-[Angus] There is
no secret society.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.728
There is no secret society,
doesn't exist.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.530
What? Oh, oh. [chuckling]

04:25.966 --> 04:28.600
Really, come on,
how do I get in on it?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.502
Well, you have to sing a song.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.373
[Rachel] Don't force her
if she doesn't want to.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.041
Oh, come on.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.743
We're all friends here.

04:37.745 --> 04:38.910
You couldn't possibly
embarrass yourself more

04:38.912 --> 04:40.412
than I do every now and again.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.880
-[Angus] That's true.
-Thank you.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.749
What do you know?

04:44.685 --> 04:49.288
Um... uh, do you know
Daniel Johnston,

04:49.290 --> 04:50.956
"True Love Will
Find You in the End?"

That was fantastic.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.734
Muah! You're beautiful.

<i> This is the society calling.</i>

07:45.065 --> 07:47.466
-Is this you, Theo?

07:48.101 --> 07:49.868
<i> You have such a pretty voice.</i>

07:49.870 --> 07:51.570
<i> It shouldn't be wasted</i>

07:53.740 --> 07:56.675
Am I being recruited?
Like in the CIA.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.845
<i>What, those jokers? No, no, no,</i>

07:59.847 --> 08:02.147

-Hello, you came.
-Hi, I did.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.208
-I'm so pleased.
-Mm-hmm, thanks.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.944
Sorry to call you at work,
I just knew that you would, uh,

08:32.946 --> 08:34.713
-pick up the phone.
-No, it was nice.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.681
-It was refreshing.
-Uh, do you want a cup of tea

08:36.683 --> 08:40.185
-or anything or coffee or--
-No, I think I'm okay, wow.

08:40.187 --> 08:43.054
Cool, right? This is my little
Aladdin's cave of,

08:43.056 --> 08:45.524
uh, musical treasures.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.727
-This is amazing.
-It's just stuff

08:48.729 --> 08:50.929
I've kind of accumulated
over the years, really.

08:50.931 --> 08:54.799
-Yeah, I'm sure.
-This, this is the most
recent acquisition.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.535
This is a upright

08:56.537 --> 08:58.737
that I got from
the fire sale after,

08:58.739 --> 09:01.039
um, Spector went to prison.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.707
-[Hannah gasps]
-Yeah, so it belonged to him.

09:02.709 --> 09:03.875
-No.
-Yeah.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.978
And, uh, what else?
Oh, this is a,

09:06.980 --> 09:09.714
this was
Chaka Khan's. [chuckling]

09:09.716 --> 09:11.116
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.887
And, uh,
that's my first Wurlitzer.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.323
That, the e.p. there,
give it a little tinkle.

09:18.325 --> 09:21.693
[electronic piano riffing]

09:23.830 --> 09:26.731
-[laughing] So cool.
-That's so cool.

09:26.733 --> 09:30.101
So what was, um, that society
you were telling me about?

09:31.171 --> 09:33.071
It's just something I made up,
it's just a silly thing.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.806
-Oh.
-I know.
Well, I have a pin, though.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.041
I made badges and everything.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.109
-Yeah.
-So, it's kind of real, then.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.612
Yeah, and you're now a fully,
fully paid up--

09:40.614 --> 09:42.814
-Full-fledged member.
-Hona-- honorary member.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.183
-You don't have to pay the subs.
-I can't get--

09:45.185 --> 09:46.985
-Here, give me your coat.
-Thanks.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.321
Make yourself at home,
and have, have a play.

09:49.323 --> 09:53.291
-Yeah, God, it's all here.
-Absolutely.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.204
<i> ¶ My bed is empty ¶</i>

10:06.940 --> 10:09.040

<i> ¶ You forgot ¶</i>

10:24.858 --> 10:27.292
That's pretty, is that you?

10:29.396 --> 10:32.163
Yeah, I wrote it when
I was a teenager, actually.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.738
There's a very good
voice in there
knocking to get out, you know?

10:39.740 --> 10:42.774
-I could hear it at Rachel's.
-[Hannah] What do
you mean, though?

10:42.776 --> 10:45.110
Well, you were sitting on it
a little bit, weren't you?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.116
You're sort of--
You're holding it back.

10:51.117 --> 10:52.417
I, I've been on
antidepressants since I was,
like, 22, so it just,

10:52.419 --> 10:54.986
just shuts that part of me off,
makes me a bit numb,

10:56.123 --> 10:57.222
you know?

10:57.224 --> 11:00.358
Sounds good when it's up here.
I like it like this.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.895
[electronic piano riffing]

11:05.432 --> 11:07.098
Where'd you get these scars?

11:07.968 --> 11:11.336
-And here?
-Uh, yeah.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.005
I drove into a tree
when I was at my lowest.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.041
So I think it's better
to feel numb than feel what

11:16.043 --> 11:17.275
I'm feeling, you know?

11:17.844 --> 11:20.011
Stay level, yeah.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.882
I just don't--
I, I hate medication.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.686
Um, yeah, always have.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.087
Can I ask you
a personal question?

11:29.690 --> 11:31.322
-Shoot.
-And delve deep?

11:31.324 --> 11:33.391
-Mm.
-Do you ever,
ever consider coming off it?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.461
'Cause, I mean, that was
a while ago, presumably.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.263
You might be,
you might be different now.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.068
-No, no.
-No?

11:45.772 --> 11:46.971
Why do you ask me?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.007
I just think it's a shame

11:49.009 --> 11:50.809
to live life with a sort of,

11:50.811 --> 11:52.711
you know,
with a filter over it, is all.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.046
Yeah.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.417
Yeah.

11:59.419 --> 12:04.289
Sometimes I feel
like I'm stuck in glue
and I might not move again.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.358
Like an octopus with no legs.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.827
[laughing] Yeah.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.762
Or a sloth that's sleeping.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.197
[both laughing]

12:12.199 --> 12:13.798
-Hey!
-Boom!

12:13.800 --> 12:15.100
We should record some
of your old songs.

12:15.102 --> 12:18.403
-What, really?
-Yes, really!

12:18.405 --> 12:20.171
I think you've got something,
I really do, you know,

12:20.173 --> 12:22.440
and I think I'm pretty good
at seeing that in people.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.142
Okay. [chuckling]

12:25.479 --> 12:27.512
All right, let's just have
a little, uh, warm-up,

12:27.514 --> 12:29.147
shall we? Get things flowing.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.182
Yeah, you want me to
do some jumping jacks?

12:31.184 --> 12:32.751
You could do your jumping
jacks if you like.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.385
People do strange
things in there.

12:39.159 --> 12:42.127
[Theo over headphones]
Okay, come in, come in,
are you receiving me, over?

12:42.129 --> 12:45.797
Yeah, receiving you
loud and clear.

12:47.033 --> 12:50.969
Small aircraft requesting
permission to land,

12:50.971 --> 12:52.203
please. [chuckling]

12:52.205 --> 12:53.505
Permission denied, I'm afraid.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.140
What, denied?

12:55.909 --> 12:57.509
Yeah. I'm afraid
I would like you

12:57.511 --> 12:59.911
to float around in
space for a little bit.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.313
No, don't let go.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.449
I would be drifting
out of orbit.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.551
Oh, I like that, let's do that.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.186
-Do what?
-That thing

13:08.188 --> 13:10.855
you just said about orbit,
let's sing that.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.793
-There's no music.
-You're the music.

13:14.795 --> 13:18.797
Just, uh, take the line
and, and sing it.

13:25.572 --> 13:29.007
<i> ¶ Don't let go ¶</i>

13:30.076 --> 13:33.211
<i> ¶ I'm drifting out of orbit ¶</i>

13:33.213 --> 13:34.412
[Theo] No!

13:35.048 --> 13:36.514
I'm not f-- There's no feeling.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.850
I don't know what
you want me to do.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.518
-I feel stupid,
-Shout it, whisper it,

13:40.520 --> 13:43.855
I, I honestly don't care,
just feel it.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.590
-Don't...
-Don't be facetious.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.859
-...let go.
-All right, look.

13:47.861 --> 13:51.029
Go, go, go, go.

13:52.566 --> 13:53.998
[door closes]

13:55.602 --> 13:58.970
Uh, now it's really
scary in here.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.039
[Theo] I'm glad,
it's supposed to be scary.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.208
Think about what you're
saying, this is

14:03.210 --> 14:06.211
fucking space,
you're in space, floating away.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.180
You're into the abyss.

14:11.852 --> 14:12.617
Yeah.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.261
All right, all right, all right.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.596
Look, look, look, look, look.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.398
Sing it to me. I'm right here,
so sing it to me.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.303
<i> ¶ Don't let go ¶</i>

14:33.240 --> 14:36.007
<i> ¶ I'm drifting out of orbit ¶</i>

14:36.009 --> 14:38.543
I'm the g--
I'm the one that can stop you.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.980
And I'm right here,
so sing it to me.

14:41.982 --> 14:42.981
Like you mean it.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.453
<i> ¶ Don't let go ¶</i>

14:49.589 --> 14:54.592
<i> ¶ I'm drifting out of orbit ¶</i>

14:54.594 --> 14:55.627
Again, again.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.400
<i> ¶ Don't let go ¶</i>

15:04.104 --> 15:09.173
<i> ¶ I'm drifting out of orbit ¶</i>

15:30.597 --> 15:31.996
In your own time.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.236
<i> ¶ Don't let go ¶</i>

15:39.673 --> 15:45.443
<i> ¶ I'm drifting out of orbit ¶</i>

15:46.146 --> 15:48.980
[light dramatic music]

15:52.352 --> 15:54.152
-[Theo] Boom.
-[chuckling]

16:00.226 --> 16:01.726
I feel dizzy. [laughing]

16:01.728 --> 16:04.028
This is your, this is
your track up here.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.330
My track, it's our track.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.965
-Our track.
-Yeah.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.500
Okay, and then your vocal track

16:09.502 --> 16:10.735
is this lovely pink one.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.004
I think it can get bouncier.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.039
I have to, often,
do a lot of messing around.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.441
[Theo mumbling]

16:16.443 --> 16:20.078
This is really, really clean.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.080
Uh, I don't know about this one.

16:22.082 --> 16:26.284
-What are you--
Ah! What are you doing?
-[laughing]

16:26.286 --> 16:28.419
You're going to
throw up all over
my main mixing desk. [chuckling]

16:28.421 --> 16:30.621
Oh, it's going to be
super rock and roll!

16:30.623 --> 16:32.623
[chuckling]

16:32.625 --> 16:34.993
[slow pop music]

16:39.532 --> 16:41.332
<i> -¶ Out of orbit ¶</i>
-Cool, right?

16:41.334 --> 16:42.600
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.435
Cut off a little bit of your--

16:44.437 --> 16:46.037
Off the top of your vocals,

16:46.039 --> 16:48.439
just a couple
of the effects. [mumbling]

16:48.441 --> 16:50.708
Special delivery from Kwan-Ting.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.243
-[Hannah] Oh, yeah?
-[Theo] Yeah.

16:52.245 --> 16:56.614
-Thank you.
-Do you see that...
[indistinct chattering]

16:59.686 --> 17:02.186
[laughing]

17:02.188 --> 17:03.554
Where are our fortune cookies?

17:03.556 --> 17:04.722
That's a good call.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.261
-No!
-They forgot them.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.464
-Our fortunes are lost.
-We'll never know what
our fortune will be now.

17:13.466 --> 17:17.535
So, bearing in mind,
you'll get a vinyl
release for the record,

17:17.537 --> 17:20.104
what about your,
your cover art, your,

17:20.106 --> 17:21.706
your debut album cover art?

17:27.547 --> 17:28.579
Maybe...

17:29.682 --> 17:31.182
black and white?

17:32.652 --> 17:35.820
-With just one thing in color?
-Mm-hmm.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.883
[Darron] Anything
Theo Ross sends
I make sure to listen to.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.753
I think we can do something
great with your songs.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.356
Maybe give them to one
of our major artists.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.759
-Oh, uh--
-You know,
most writers who come in here,

18:48.761 --> 18:50.495
they're never going
to see the stage.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.296
All right? This is
a huge opportunity.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.465
I've got a line of
songwriters down the hall

18:54.467 --> 18:55.867
trying to write for Dana Lee.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.136
This is where the money's at.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.472
Right.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.677
I mean, I can use that
kind of money. [chuckling]

19:06.679 --> 19:08.713
Great, let me
introduce you guys.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.316
-Right now? Um.
-[phone beeping]

19:12.318 --> 19:13.484
-Yeah.
-She's here?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.453
Can you send her in, thanks.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.722
[background pop music]

19:19.726 --> 19:24.929
Hi, [gasping] I love your stuff.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.831
It's so good.

19:28.635 --> 19:32.537
Wow, I... love those nails.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.805
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, they're not nails.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.440
-They're claws.
-[Darron] Mm.

19:36.442 --> 19:37.775
-Right, Darron?
-Right.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.477
-Darron knows.
-Yeah.

19:39.479 --> 19:43.581
[laughing] Anyway,
I thought, this girl,

19:43.583 --> 19:46.684
she must've been kicked around,
because it feels to me

19:46.686 --> 19:49.187
-like you know my damage.
-[Darron] Yeah.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.556
Uh, I'm sorry to hear
about your damage.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.858
[Dana] Look at her, look at her,
look at this face.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.693
-[Darron] I know. I know.
-Look at us, look at us.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.328
-I told you.
-Look, we could be
sisters, right?

19:57.330 --> 19:58.629
-Easy.
-Yeah!

19:58.631 --> 20:00.698
-Aw! Aw!
-Perfect.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.900
-Who's who?
-Of course. Just opposite
sides of the same coin.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.836
-Oh, I call heads.
-Take them, I will
take the tails.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.573
Darron, I love her.
I love her, I want her.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.907
-Can I have her?
-She's yours.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.242
-Please.
-Anything you want.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.810
-Great.
-She loves you.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.812
It's great. You know,
when a singer finds a writer

20:14.814 --> 20:17.415
they think sounds like them,
they hang on for life.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.283
So, have as much
ready as you can

20:19.285 --> 20:21.719
going in, and say
hi to Theo for me.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.789
Oh, I actually haven't been able
to get a hold of him lately.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.692
You haven't? Uh-oh.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.530
I was coming to find you,

20:32.532 --> 20:34.332
because I wanted to
tell you the good news.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.969
Darron wants me
to write for Dana Lee.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.441
How cool.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.816
Thought you might be a little
more excited than that.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.452
You're not singing
though, are you?

20:57.490 --> 21:00.591
It's, it's still a big
opportunity though.

21:07.800 --> 21:08.866
Where's your car?

21:08.868 --> 21:10.434
Why don't I drive you to it?

21:12.639 --> 21:14.372
-Theo?
-Yes, love?

21:15.041 --> 21:16.574
Where's your car parked?

21:16.909 --> 21:20.311
I'm having trouble recalling
that at this juncture.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.314
What juncture, what?

21:23.316 --> 21:25.616
I mean, I don't know
where I've parked it.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.453
What is going on with you?

21:30.490 --> 21:32.423
-[car beeping]
-[groans] Fucking hell!

21:32.425 --> 21:34.625
Hey, what is--

21:34.627 --> 21:36.827
-Are you on something?
-No, no.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.331
Hey.

21:44.337 --> 21:45.153
Are you sure you're okay?

21:45.154 --> 21:45.970
-Do you want me
to drive you home?
-Yes, please.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.438
-Yeah?
-Yes.

21:54.847 --> 21:57.081
-Are you sure
it's the right key?
-Yeah, it's the right key.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.083
It's the right key.
It's definitely the right key.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.921
So, what, is the,
is the lock broken?

22:04.791 --> 22:05.790
No.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.795
It's Rudy. It's my landlord.
He's changed it on me.

22:13.633 --> 22:14.999
Why would he change the lock?

22:15.001 --> 22:16.634
He's so grouchy.

22:18.404 --> 22:20.938
-Come on, we should go.
-Theo, are you being evicted?

22:25.378 --> 22:27.678
[radio static]

22:48.468 --> 22:50.000
[voices glitching]

22:58.711 --> 23:00.411
If you listen
really carefully...

23:03.516 --> 23:05.449
you can hear their
transmissions.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.122
-Okay.
-Shh!

23:13.459 --> 23:14.525
Um.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.160
It's, it's there.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.728
It's just, just,
just underneath.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.465
It's underneath.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.903
Just stay here, okay?

23:26.973 --> 23:28.506
I'm going to be right back.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.814
-Hey.
-Hi.

23:36.816 --> 23:37.882
How's it going?

23:37.884 --> 23:39.450
Um, it's okay.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.820
Uh, I, I actually,
I have Theo here with me.

23:42.822 --> 23:46.824
-Oh, cool, where is he?
-He, um, he's just in the car.

23:48.161 --> 23:50.928
Um, he's acting really funny.

23:50.930 --> 23:54.965
-Funny like how?
-Um... I don't know.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.968
He's, uh, he's being weird.

23:58.604 --> 24:01.539
He's, he's just not making
any sense or anything.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.140
[sighing] Oh, God, not again.

24:03.876 --> 24:04.975
What does that mean?

24:06.212 --> 24:07.178
Come inside.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.648
[Hannah] What happened?

24:10.650 --> 24:12.750
Well, back when he was touring
with the band,

24:12.752 --> 24:14.185
they were doing a lot of drugs.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.887
I mean, they were
completely bonkers.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.823
One of the craziest
bands of the '90s.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.759
And one time he got
dosed with something bad,

24:21.761 --> 24:23.928
some bad acid or something.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.630
And it triggered
something in him,
a schizophrenic break,

24:26.632 --> 24:28.232
and he was never the same,

24:29.068 --> 24:31.902
in and out of mental
hospitals for years.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.871
His medication actually
handles it really well,

24:34.474 --> 24:35.873
like, he's lucky like that.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.143
But sometimes
he stops taking it.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.049
[Hannah] He didn't tell me
he had a mental illness.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.860
[radio static]

24:57.563 --> 24:58.662
Hey, Theo.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.600
Hey, chippy chops, what's up?

25:04.704 --> 25:05.903
Are you feeling okay?

25:06.806 --> 25:09.139
A little off maybe, or...

25:10.743 --> 25:13.143
-anything?
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.513
I think I've really got
something here, listen.

25:19.652 --> 25:22.219
Um, it's static.

25:23.022 --> 25:26.857
No, underneath the static.
They communicate
on these channels.

25:26.859 --> 25:30.160
And they can also send other
signals over the radio waves

25:30.162 --> 25:32.062
in frequencies
you don't even hear.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.167
-I can't, I can't hear it.
-Well, listen, listen, listen,
listen, listen, listen.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.302
-Theo, come on.
-Listen.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.937
Theo, please,

25:39.939 --> 25:41.772
Can you turn that down?
It's really loud!

25:41.774 --> 25:43.607
-Please turn it down.
-[Rachel] Hey, Theo!

25:43.609 --> 25:44.875
-Theo.
-[Rachel] Theo!

25:45.645 --> 25:47.244
I have your sister on the phone.

25:48.881 --> 25:53.117
-Theo? [indistinct chatter]
-I don't want to talk to her!

25:53.119 --> 25:54.752
What the fuck!

25:56.923 --> 25:59.657
I told you, I don't want
to talk to her, all right?

25:59.659 --> 26:01.659
Jesus Christ. You need to relax.

26:01.661 --> 26:04.228
If I say I don't want to talk
to her then I don't want
to talk to her.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.697
Okay, okay, Theo,
you don't have to.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.299
-God.
-Liv, I'll call you
back later, okay?

26:08.301 --> 26:10.000
You need to just chill.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.902
[Hannah] Theo, come on,
we're trying to help you.

26:12.605 --> 26:13.871
Well, you're not.

26:14.574 --> 26:16.907
[Rachel] Okay, Theo,
how can we help?

26:16.909 --> 26:18.976
Tell us, Theo!

26:23.950 --> 26:26.216
-They keep calling
about the car.
-Who does?

26:26.218 --> 26:28.852
The leasing company
keep calling about the car.

26:28.854 --> 26:31.021
They said if I don't
make a payment they're
going to take it back.

26:31.023 --> 26:33.357
-[Hannah] But you lost your car.
-No, I didn't lose it.

26:33.359 --> 26:36.360
I forgot where I parked it,
didn't I? Different.

26:36.362 --> 26:39.029
Okay, well, where were you
when you were last with it?

26:42.768 --> 26:44.268
I was shopping in Beverly Hills.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.604
Okay, well,
let's retrace your steps.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.205
-[Hannah] Yeah.
-Give me the keys,

26:48.207 --> 26:49.907
-I'll drive.
-[Hannah] Okay.

26:54.313 --> 26:57.214
[Rachel] Come on, Theo. Theo!

26:57.216 --> 26:58.849
-What?
-Come on, we'll take you
back to your car.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.784
-No.
-Why?

27:00.786 --> 27:02.987
Because, I'm not going with her.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.289
What, why not with me?

27:07.994 --> 27:09.259
She's wearing that sweater.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.730
What is-- What's wrong with it?

27:12.732 --> 27:15.966
It's yellow, isn't it?
Fuck! [chuckling]

27:17.336 --> 27:19.870
[Angus chuckles] Oh, God.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.171
[Angus sighs]

27:23.376 --> 27:24.808
What is it this time?

27:25.678 --> 27:27.745
He was talking about
being watched.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.680
Oh, well, we all
know that's true.

27:29.682 --> 27:32.416
I mean, our phones are
listening to us all the time.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.819
Does he know about this?

27:35.821 --> 27:39.657
I told him we were having a
party, 'cause he loves parties.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.325
-Hello, everyone.
-Hey.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.694
-[all] Hi.
-[Todd] Can we get
something to drink?

27:43.696 --> 27:45.796
[Rachel] Uh, we're
having an intervention.

27:45.798 --> 27:48.932
-[Jake] Oh, that's cool.
-[Todd] Wait,
it's not for me, is it?

27:48.934 --> 27:51.869
Uh, I know I drink a lot,
but it's not a problem.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.071
-I promise you guys,
it's not an issue.
-[Todd] Hey, guys.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.073
-Hey.
-Where is he?

27:56.075 --> 27:57.207
He's just out here.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.343
[Todd] What happened?

27:59.345 --> 28:01.712
[Hannah] He stopped
taking his medication.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.684
He took the mushrooms
on Halloween.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.053
Did you give those to him?

28:09.055 --> 28:10.454
No, absolutely not.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.992
-He asked, I--
-You should know better.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.194
But I don't know his deal.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.962
Is that, is that
what set him off?

28:18.964 --> 28:21.265
[Rachel] See,
this is so frustrating.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.000
We've been through this
so many times with him

28:23.002 --> 28:25.102
and he still messes
with his medication.

28:25.971 --> 28:28.872
I mean, who does psychedelics
on anti-psychotics.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.141
[Frankie] Sometimes they
do it to self-medicate.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.976
It's hard to tell
what comes first.

28:32.978 --> 28:34.411
[Angus] He's definitely
got a problem with the booze,

28:34.413 --> 28:36.880
but that is not
the issue at hand.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.249
His dad was a wine merchant.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.318
I thought he was a vicar.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.220
He was, he turned to
God to save his liver.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.422
He was always
the life of the party

28:45.424 --> 28:47.357
when I first started
Night of Noise.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.430
It's his sense of
humor that saves him.

28:54.934 --> 28:58.736
He's so funny.
You know, he says the same
things when he's normal.

28:59.405 --> 29:02.506
It's just when
he's off his meds
he actually means all of it.

29:05.344 --> 29:06.844
He's calmer now.

29:09.782 --> 29:11.448
He took a double dose
of his medication

29:11.450 --> 29:13.050
and it seems to have worked.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.185
His family said they're
going to send some more

29:15.187 --> 29:16.386
over from England.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.756
And then if he takes
them regularly

29:18.758 --> 29:20.524
for a couple of weeks
he should straighten out.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.362
We just need someone
to watch him.

29:25.364 --> 29:26.764
Well, here we go.

29:28.167 --> 29:31.535
Listen, Theo is one
of my best friends.

29:32.104 --> 29:36.006
Now I've done this
for him two times already.

29:36.008 --> 29:38.909
I was managing the tour
when he had his first break.

29:38.911 --> 29:42.980
It was the scariest fucking
thing I have ever witnessed.

29:42.982 --> 29:46.049
His last slip, he was stayed on
my couch for the entire time.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.985
He nearly gave me
a nervous breakdown.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.553
But we're getting older.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.455
My girlfriend just moved in,

29:51.457 --> 29:52.923
I can't put this on her.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.258
I'm sorry, no.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.527
It's someone else's
turn for once.

29:56.529 --> 29:58.095
All right, you guys,
hey, I'm sorry,

29:58.097 --> 29:59.997
but I couldn't handle
that right now.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.199
Understandably.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.234
We leave for tour for a week.

30:04.236 --> 30:08.205
-[Jake] Yeah.
-[Rachel] I just
rent a room here.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.407
Okay, well, what about
his family, huh?

30:10.409 --> 30:11.909
-[Rachel] Well...
-Can they do it?

30:11.911 --> 30:13.277
...there's his dad,
but he won't go to him

30:13.279 --> 30:14.478
when he's like this.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.847
It's just up to us, I'm afraid.

30:22.188 --> 30:23.153
Hey, you.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.223
Hey, chippy chops.

30:26.859 --> 30:29.827
-What's up?
-I don't know.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.596
-Just selling my soul.
-[laughing] Don't say that.

30:32.598 --> 30:35.265
I'm sorry, don't say that.
Look, I just, come here.

30:35.267 --> 30:37.334
I, I just don't see you

30:37.336 --> 30:40.170
as just being like
a cog in a big machine.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.507
You know, I know,
I know there's more to
you than that, you know?

30:43.509 --> 30:45.943
But if this is what
you want to do,

30:45.945 --> 30:49.279
it's a huge break.
You know, so don't worry
about me, for God's sake.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.482
Yeah, well,
you're the only reason
I'm getting a huge break.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.952
[chuckling] I just need to rest.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.987
-You know, I'm pretty tired.
-Yeah.

30:57.923 --> 31:00.290
[sighing] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.025
I know, I know I'm a huge pain.

31:04.129 --> 31:05.462
Look at your eyes.

31:08.133 --> 31:09.900
You look like you're
doing better.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.368
[chuckling]

31:14.006 --> 31:16.206
Aside from crashing
out of my life

31:16.208 --> 31:18.575
and having to rebuild
everything from scratch.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.945
You've already
done so much though.

31:23.616 --> 31:25.349
I don't have anything
to show for it.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.352
I got a flat-lining career.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.055
I got no family.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.124
[light dramatic music]

31:34.126 --> 31:35.392
Who'd want to be with me?

31:38.998 --> 31:40.097
That's not true.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.166
It is true. It is very true.

31:43.569 --> 31:44.635
I scare people.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.572
You don't scare me.

31:54.446 --> 31:55.512
I don't?

31:57.016 --> 31:58.148
Mm-mm.

32:07.126 --> 32:11.228
Earlier, by the car,
I was scared.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.365
I was really scared for you.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.670
But you don't scare me.

32:51.337 --> 32:56.707
Okay, uh, so, you can take
the couch if you want.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.744
Um, or we can both
sleep in my bed.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.480
Oh, no, you're okay.
I'll just stay on the couch.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.383
It's fine. It's probably better
anyway, 'cause I snore, so.

33:06.385 --> 33:09.619
[chuckling] Oh, okay, cool.

33:09.621 --> 33:13.623
Well, um, I need
to do some work.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.194
So, why don't you just
make yourself comfortable.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.664
-Thanks, love.
-Yeah, of course.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.134
Okay.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.406
Do you have any fly pie?

33:30.342 --> 33:35.045
What? No, that's gross.

33:35.047 --> 33:36.513
My mom used to make it.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.548
Really, you like real flies?

33:41.353 --> 33:43.537
-That's disgusting.
-No, raisins.

33:43.538 --> 33:45.722
I thought the flies were like--
Oh, no, I meant, uh,
the raisins were like flies.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.424
Oh, yeah, I could see that.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.594
[chuckling]

33:55.768 --> 33:57.134
What are you--

34:00.239 --> 34:02.472
-Are you counting my blinks?
-No.

34:06.712 --> 34:09.146
Um... what about--

34:09.148 --> 34:11.615
You want to watch
some TV, maybe?

34:13.252 --> 34:18.355
I can... uh,
find whatever you want.

34:21.126 --> 34:23.560
Yeah? Okay.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.083
Okay.

34:50.189 --> 34:53.090
-[sighs]
-[distant lawnmower]

35:04.336 --> 35:06.570
I think it's time
to take another pill.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.273
No, I don't want to.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.382
No, Theo, you won't.

35:20.185 --> 35:22.385
That-- No, come on.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.122
-You have to take this.
-No, I don't want to.

35:25.124 --> 35:26.656
-I told you.
-Please, Theo, I--

35:26.658 --> 35:28.258
It's, it's important to me.

35:28.260 --> 35:31.361
Well, you're on Toliset.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.830
All right?
That is the worst one.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.233
That sucks time.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.735
Okay, but it,
it does work for you.

35:38.737 --> 35:41.571
You just have to
take it consistently
and it's going to help you.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.640
I don't agree
and I'm not going to take it.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.308
It, it's, it--

35:45.310 --> 35:46.810
You don't have to agree,
it's just true.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.912
-It's going to help you.
-I'm not taking it.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.914
-Please, Theo.
-You can't make me.

35:57.389 --> 35:58.722
It's true, I can't.

35:58.724 --> 36:02.159
All right. Well, I got a session
booked with a band, so.

36:02.161 --> 36:03.793
No, you need to relax.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.463
-Well, they've got
the studio booked.
-Just, I--

36:06.465 --> 36:08.265
Theo, I don't think
you're in the right state to go

36:08.267 --> 36:09.533
and do something like that.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.168
-I think--
-I really need the money.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.838
Damn. Okay, wait.

36:16.175 --> 36:18.308
-I'll, I'll-- We can go.
I'll take you.
-Great.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.410
But I need you to take
one of these first.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.279
No, I'm not taking it.

36:22.281 --> 36:23.747
Fine, then we're not going.

36:24.583 --> 36:27.450
You-- All right, look, you--
[chuckling nervously]

36:27.452 --> 36:29.686
I'll take, I'll take,
I'll take the pill and then--

36:29.688 --> 36:31.688
Okay, give me the pill.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.424
All right. [clears throat]

36:37.696 --> 36:38.795
Uh-huh.

36:40.232 --> 36:41.331
Can we go now?

36:43.502 --> 36:45.569
I'm sorry,
I'm, I'm, I'm sorry, God.

36:46.638 --> 36:48.572
-[chuckling]
-It's okay.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.674
It just gets a bit,
uh, you know.

36:50.676 --> 36:51.808
All right.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.546
Slam the door behind you.

37:03.422 --> 37:04.955
-No, it's not.
-It's an abbreviation.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.856
-You can add the letters.
-Abbreviations are--

37:06.858 --> 37:08.892
Hello, chaps. Hello, chaps.
Oi, oi, saveloy.

37:08.894 --> 37:12.462
-Sorry I'm late. I was, uh--
-Hey.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.631
-Lost track of time.
Thank you, Jake.
-Hey, Derek,

37:14.633 --> 37:16.399
can you hold on
a second, please?

37:16.401 --> 37:18.635
-[Derek] Yeah, yeah, sorry. Hey.
-Thank you.

37:20.272 --> 37:22.772
-You sure this is an okay idea?
-Yeah, it's fine.

37:22.774 --> 37:25.609
Just don't let them know
about his condition,

37:25.611 --> 37:28.545
-'cause we don't want it
getting around.
-Got it, yeah, well, if he--

37:28.547 --> 37:31.248
We won't mention anything.
He's going to stay in
here the whole time, so.

37:31.250 --> 37:33.016
-Thank you.
-All righty, Toddy.

37:33.685 --> 37:34.884
[clears throat]

37:35.821 --> 37:37.387
Okay, where were we?

37:37.990 --> 37:40.023
Hey, Theo, what's up, dude?

37:42.361 --> 37:43.760
Okay, you guys ready
to give it a go?

37:44.563 --> 37:46.930
-Uh, yeah, yeah, so.
-Okay.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.659
<i> ¶ You told me you-- ¶</i>

38:15.661 --> 38:17.727
Uh, hey, Derek, that's great.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.463
Now, um, can you sing more
like a squeaky duck?

38:22.634 --> 38:23.800
What?

38:27.773 --> 38:29.739
Uh, Theo wants to know if, uh,

38:29.741 --> 38:31.508
you could sing a little higher.

38:31.510 --> 38:34.644
And, uh, maybe, uh,
from the back of your throat.

38:37.649 --> 38:38.632
From his molars.

38:38.633 --> 38:39.616
From his, tell him,
from his molars.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.619
Can you sing from your molars?

38:42.621 --> 38:44.321
-My mo-- molars?
-Yes.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.956
-Your back teeth.
-Your back teeth.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.926
Yeah, okay, yeah. I, uh,

38:49.928 --> 38:52.028
-yeah, got it.
-Thank you.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.866

39:23.128 --> 39:24.794

39:24.796 --> 39:26.529
-124.
-Yeah, that's good.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.465
-Now you're hot.
-110.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.066
Close, a little south.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.602
-115, 114?
-Dude.

39:32.604 --> 39:33.703
-112.
-Yeah!

39:33.705 --> 39:35.605
Yeah, dude, I love 112.

39:35.607 --> 39:38.141
Yeah, 112 is a hot, hot temp.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.709
-Hey!
-Guys.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.811
Uh, can we hear,
can we hear something?

39:41.813 --> 39:44.547
Uh, Theo needs to concentrate.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.751
-So...
-Okay, yeah, cool.

39:47.753 --> 39:49.452
Sure. Yeah.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.423
Well, this is--

<i> ¶ The way ¶</i>

39:55.994 --> 40:01.398

40:02.701 --> 40:07.170
<i> ¶ You wreck me in a day ¶</i>

40:07.172 --> 40:08.805
Maybe the insanity

40:09.508 --> 40:13.076
makes more neural
connectivity pathways

40:13.078 --> 40:14.778
in his brain or something.

40:15.680 --> 40:19.649
Yeah, I mean, maybe he should
stay off his medication.

40:19.651 --> 40:20.850
Don't say that.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.119
[Jake] You know it's true.

40:23.121 --> 40:26.122
No. No, it isn't true,
necessarily.

41:39.664 --> 41:40.763
Yeah.

41:57.949 --> 42:00.550
[Todd] Um, uh, Theo, I--

42:00.552 --> 42:02.819
I think it was a,
a little better before.

42:02.821 --> 42:05.655
The way it was before. It was,
it was a bit dialed back,

42:05.657 --> 42:07.824
-Why don't we just.
-Yeah, I mean, it's kind of,

42:07.826 --> 42:11.561
sort of like not
sounding like spasm, you know?

42:12.664 --> 42:14.964
-[music stops]
-Yeah, well,
that's a, that's a good thing.

42:16.201 --> 42:19.269
-What?
-Well, you're complete shit.

42:19.271 --> 42:20.270
[Hannah] Oh.

42:20.272 --> 42:22.972
-Fuck you.
-[Todd] Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Okay, Theo.

42:22.974 --> 42:25.308
-What, what is that?
-He, he didn't mean that.

42:25.310 --> 42:28.311
No, I-- No, I did mean it.
I did, I meant it more than
I've ever meant anything.

42:28.313 --> 42:31.548
Well, if you don't like our
music, why are you working
on our record, man?

42:31.550 --> 42:34.851
Well, I need the money. And I,
I thought I could possibly

42:34.853 --> 42:36.886
just squeeze an ounce
of inspiration

42:36.888 --> 42:39.088
out of your sort of
derivative whack-off song.

42:39.090 --> 42:41.257
-What the fuck, man!
-Derek, Derek,
Derek, Derek.

42:41.259 --> 42:43.226
-Relax. I'm sorry.
He's, he's, uh--
-He's what?

42:43.228 --> 42:45.228
-He's a little--
-He's an artist.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.664
-He's an asshole.
-No, he's not, he's not a--

42:47.666 --> 42:49.032
-Where's Rudy? Rudy!
-What?

42:49.034 --> 42:50.900
-No, no.
-Rudy, come in here.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.636
-This is fucking
ridiculous, man. Rudy!
-Relax. Relax.

42:53.638 --> 42:55.772
-This guy's an asshole.
-No, he's not.
He's not an asshole.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.206
-Yeah, he is.
-Hi, Rudy.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.742
-He just called our music shit.
-Hi, Rudy.

43:00.645 --> 43:01.811
Is that true?

43:03.281 --> 43:05.214
Yeah, they suck. [stuttering]

43:05.216 --> 43:07.750
-Fuck.
-Wow, wow.

43:07.752 --> 43:10.053
You're not even
supposed to be in here.
You've been evicted.

43:10.689 --> 43:13.923
Theo's been late on his rent
and there's all these
charges on the bank account.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.993
Have you been using
company money?

43:20.599 --> 43:22.999
Theo, where'd you get
all those watches?

43:27.205 --> 43:29.973
-[Hannah] Oh, my God.
-[Rudy] Theo, give me the card.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.910
-[Todd] Oi! Oh. Whoa.
-Close your eyes.
Blink backwards.

43:33.912 --> 43:35.812
-You can't follow me down
the tube, it's too slippery.
-Theo?

43:35.814 --> 43:37.714
-No, I have to go.
-Chill, chill.

43:37.716 --> 43:38.948
I have to find
the princess of time.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.283
[Todd] There you go, all right.

43:40.285 --> 43:46.122
-Awesome.
-Wait, just, somebody tell me
what the fuck just happened.

[Frankie on phone]<i> Hey, Hannah.</i>

[Hannah]<i> I'm going to</i>
<i> come visit you a lot, Theo.</i>

44:36.274 --> 44:38.408
[Angus] Hannah,
can you please direct me?

44:39.811 --> 44:43.012
-This, this exit here.
-Oh, I see it.

44:43.014 --> 44:44.947
I don't want to go to
the fucking hospital!

44:45.283 --> 44:47.884
I don't want to go!
You just want to lock me up
and turn me into

44:47.886 --> 44:50.086
-a time generating vegetable!
-Calm him down! Calm him down!

44:50.088 --> 44:52.355
-Theo, Theo, please stop!
-Get off me you slut!

44:53.358 --> 44:55.024
We all know you're not pregnant.

44:55.860 --> 44:57.994
Someone stuck
a fucking bomb up you.

44:57.996 --> 45:00.730
They should take you to a field
and detonate you somewhere.

45:00.732 --> 45:03.933
-Jesus Christ, hey!
Get the fucking-- Get the wheel!
-Hey, hey!

45:03.935 --> 45:07.036
Get him off! Help me
get the fucking wheel!

45:07.038 --> 45:08.838
Get him off me! Get him the f--

45:08.840 --> 45:11.474
-Get the wheel!
-You're kidnapping me!

45:12.043 --> 45:13.976
Theo, let go!

45:13.978 --> 45:16.179
For fuck's sake!
We're going to crash!

45:16.181 --> 45:18.915
God, you're going
to fucking kill us!

45:18.917 --> 45:22.285
Is that what you fucking want?
You could've killed us all.

45:22.287 --> 45:24.721
You're taking me
somewhere against my will.

45:24.723 --> 45:28.391
-Theo, fucking calm down.
-What the fuck was that?

45:28.393 --> 45:29.959
-What the fuck was that?
-Let's pull over.

45:29.961 --> 45:31.494
-Can we pull over?
-[Angus] All right.

45:43.475 --> 45:45.341
Hey, Frankie.

45:45.910 --> 45:48.745
-Hey, are you okay?
-What a fucking monster.

45:48.747 --> 45:51.080
I know, that was,
that was awful.

45:51.082 --> 45:53.249
-That was not--
-No, I'm not,
I'm not helping him.

45:54.152 --> 45:57.320
Come on, we just got
to get him there. I mean,
clearly he needs to be there.

45:57.322 --> 46:00.423
No way! I'm not getting back
in the car with him, Hannah.

46:01.126 --> 46:03.760
We cannot leave you on
the side of the road like this.

46:03.762 --> 46:05.828
He's got this fucked up
thing going on.

46:07.265 --> 46:10.767
Look, I don't care if you
leave me, he's dangerous.

46:12.904 --> 46:13.870
He's scared.

46:15.540 --> 46:16.873
Hannah.

46:18.209 --> 46:19.509
Where'd you go, Theo?

46:19.511 --> 46:23.780
The Theo I know would never
say anything like that.

46:32.190 --> 46:34.357
[man on phone]<i> Don't be nervous.</i>
<i> Dana Lee is a person</i>

46:34.359 --> 46:37.426
<i> just like anyone else. She's</i>
<i>the one who's probably nervous.</i>

46:37.428 --> 46:39.829
[chuckling] Yeah, I'm sure.

46:39.831 --> 46:41.430
<i> Just have as much fun as</i>
<i> you can going in and,</i>

46:41.432 --> 46:42.999
<i> and see what happens.</i>

46:44.502 --> 46:47.470
Okay, sure, yeah,
I'll just let it flow.

46:48.339 --> 46:49.806
<i> Okay, call me after.</i>

46:50.542 --> 46:53.176
Okay, yeah,
I'll do that, thank you.

47:21.973 --> 47:24.073
[pills rattling]

47:40.358 --> 47:43.092
[light dramatic music]

48:29.274 --> 48:31.274
[door bell buzzing]

48:34.479 --> 48:36.979
Here you go,
Theo's just down the hall.

48:37.415 --> 48:38.648
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

48:40.652 --> 48:43.486
[light dramatic music]

48:57.135 --> 49:00.303
[indistinct chatter]

49:11.616 --> 49:12.949
Hey.

49:34.539 --> 49:39.308
Oh, God, being here
makes me feel unstable.

49:44.382 --> 49:49.085
So, um, if you agree to go back
to your family in London,

49:49.087 --> 49:50.486
we can get you out of here.

49:52.190 --> 49:53.556
No, I can't go back to London.

49:54.225 --> 49:57.493
Why not, Theo, why?

49:57.495 --> 50:00.696
What, because you
don't like it? Tough.

50:01.532 --> 50:04.000
You only have to bear it
for a little while.

50:05.069 --> 50:06.635
You really like this better?

50:06.637 --> 50:08.771
I can't go back to London

50:08.773 --> 50:11.173
because London is
a place in my past.

50:11.175 --> 50:13.075
I can't go back to the past.

50:13.077 --> 50:14.744
If I travel, I'll make a ripple.

50:16.047 --> 50:17.413
-[chuckling]
-A ripple?

50:17.415 --> 50:18.581
Yeah.

50:21.019 --> 50:22.785
Explain that, please.

50:29.027 --> 50:32.661
In space time, if I, then--

50:32.663 --> 50:34.330
If I-- If there's a ripple,

50:34.332 --> 50:36.699
the feather will feel it
and they'll find me.

50:40.104 --> 50:42.371
If you go back to London,

50:42.373 --> 50:44.306
you won't be going
back into your past

50:44.308 --> 50:46.308
because you would
be going there now.

50:46.310 --> 50:49.278
So it would just be
a geographical distance,
that's it.

50:52.583 --> 50:53.616
You don't get it.

50:55.386 --> 50:56.485
I don't.

51:00.525 --> 51:05.795
I can't go, I can't leave
because I can't leave my wife.

51:06.431 --> 51:07.596
What wife?

51:07.598 --> 51:10.633
They won't, they won't
let us be together yet.

51:10.635 --> 51:12.334
Her father, her,

51:12.336 --> 51:16.405
her, her father is time
of the little things.

51:16.407 --> 51:18.374
She is the princess of time.

51:18.376 --> 51:20.309
I am time of the sea mammals.

51:20.678 --> 51:23.446
It's not ea--
I, I-- It's not easy
to explain, I can't just--

51:23.448 --> 51:25.848
Theo, no one is after you.

51:25.850 --> 51:27.650
No one is trying to kill you.

51:27.652 --> 51:28.851
It is all in your head.

51:28.853 --> 51:30.519
Can you not see that?

51:31.789 --> 51:33.722
Your head is playing
tricks on you.

51:34.659 --> 51:35.858
You have schizophrenia.

51:38.096 --> 51:42.565
You're so smart, Theo.
You are one of the smartest
people that I know.

51:42.567 --> 51:44.467
Can't you see that that's
what's happening here?

51:44.469 --> 51:49.605
You can outsmart this,
I know you can, I know.

51:51.476 --> 51:53.309
[chuckling]

51:55.513 --> 51:57.480
You're a tricky
little minx, aren't you?

51:58.816 --> 52:00.349
Theo, please.

52:01.385 --> 52:02.685
That is the truth.

52:02.687 --> 52:05.654
Look at me, that is the truth.

52:09.861 --> 52:13.129
Hey, what is your,
what is your gut telling you?

52:14.298 --> 52:15.865
You have to trust that feeling.

52:16.601 --> 52:21.770
Please listen, please, Theo.
Please let me help you.

52:26.177 --> 52:27.209
Okay.

52:28.479 --> 52:31.914
Okay, if you want to help me
get me out of here.

52:31.916 --> 52:36.152
Yes, you just have to
agree to go to London.

52:36.154 --> 52:38.420
No, no, no, I absolutely--

52:38.422 --> 52:40.456
I am not going back to London!

52:42.527 --> 52:43.492
Okay.

52:47.932 --> 52:49.231
-Okay.
-[Hannah] I tried.

52:49.233 --> 52:51.534
[Theo] Okay, goodbye.

53:00.278 --> 53:02.611
So, Mr. Ross will be
leaving here with you today?

53:03.514 --> 53:05.748
Uh, no, no, he isn't.

53:05.750 --> 53:07.783
We have it down here that he is.

53:07.785 --> 53:09.585
What do you mean?

53:09.587 --> 53:11.220
He's on a 5150.

53:11.222 --> 53:12.588
We can only keep
them for three days,

53:12.590 --> 53:14.423
then we have to release him.

53:14.425 --> 53:16.492
Uh, no one else is
scheduled to pick him up?

53:16.494 --> 53:20.229
No, no, no,
you can't release him.

53:20.965 --> 53:23.933
-He's really not well.
-We can't commit anyone

53:23.935 --> 53:26.235
unless they willfully
commit themselves.

53:28.439 --> 53:30.272
He's paranoid.

53:30.675 --> 53:32.374
I mean, he thinks that
everyone around him

53:34.345 --> 53:35.611
is trying to kill him.

53:35.612 --> 53:36.878
He's not going to willfully
commit himself, is he?

53:37.448 --> 53:38.981
Can I speak to a doctor, please?

53:45.990 --> 53:46.956
Fuck.

53:53.497 --> 53:56.498
Hi, hi, thank you, um,

53:57.735 --> 54:00.369
listen, you can't
release my friend today.

54:00.805 --> 54:02.338
He's really not well.

54:02.340 --> 54:05.574
And he needs to be on his
medication for at least 14 days

54:05.576 --> 54:07.543
before it actually
starts kicking in.

54:08.312 --> 54:10.946
Okay, we can only put him
on a 5250 under
three conditions,

54:10.948 --> 54:12.615
if he presents as
a danger to himself,

54:12.617 --> 54:14.016
he presents as
a danger to others

54:14.018 --> 54:15.884
or he presents as
gravely disabled.

54:16.420 --> 54:17.987
-Look, Theo's sick.
-Uh-huh.

54:17.989 --> 54:19.922
He's just not sick enough
for us to force him to stay.

54:20.958 --> 54:23.592
Well, can you give
him another evaluation?

54:24.428 --> 54:26.395
-[doctor] We don't do
second evaluations.
-What?

54:26.397 --> 54:28.764
Then, I mean, what is it
that you're doing here?

54:29.667 --> 54:32.801
Um, okay, I know that
you're just doing your job

54:32.803 --> 54:34.670
and that this is the protocol,

54:34.672 --> 54:37.706
but this is how you can actually
help somebody to get better.

54:37.708 --> 54:41.610
Right? Please give
him a second evaluation.

54:43.648 --> 54:45.814
[doctor] Okay,
do you know where you are?

54:45.816 --> 54:49.885
[Theo] Uh, I'm at the,
the Elysium Psychiatric
Facility in Los Angeles.

54:49.887 --> 54:51.587
[doctor] Okay,
have you had any thoughts

54:51.589 --> 54:53.756
of suicide or homicide
since you've been here?

54:53.758 --> 54:55.758
-No.
-No?

54:57.495 --> 55:00.329
Okay, and when did these
symptoms first start?

55:01.532 --> 55:03.699
Uh, probably about
two weeks ago.

55:03.701 --> 55:06.635
I was, um, working a ton

55:06.637 --> 55:10.472
and I was producing
two albums at once,
under a lot of stress.

55:10.474 --> 55:13.075
And, uh, I was having
real difficulty sleeping.

55:13.077 --> 55:15.544
-Ah.
-And, um,

55:15.546 --> 55:17.513
I think I was
dehydrated as well.

55:17.848 --> 55:20.649
You know, sleep deprivation
can make you feel
a little funny.

55:21.752 --> 55:25.087
No, hey!
No, he, he sees assassins.

55:25.089 --> 55:28.524
No, he, he told me that
people are after him

55:28.526 --> 55:31.460
and that they want
to take his watches
and they want to wipe out time.

55:31.462 --> 55:34.496
-That is what you said to me.
-I know, and it must
have sounded very loopy.

55:34.498 --> 55:35.964
-I get it, but my friends--
-No, no!

55:35.966 --> 55:37.700
-My, my friends are worried.
-Theo, that's--

55:37.702 --> 55:39.835
-He's not telling you the truth!
-I have delicate nerves.

55:39.837 --> 55:41.403
-You're lying!
-I always have.

55:41.405 --> 55:43.072
Oh, my God, you liar!

56:02.593 --> 56:09.631
I spy with my little eye
something white and fluffy.

56:15.506 --> 56:17.973
-A cloud.
-Yes! Oh, you're good at this,

56:17.975 --> 56:20.943
I shouldn't have even started
playing this with you.

56:20.945 --> 56:22.511
Uh, do you want to have a go?

56:22.880 --> 56:24.847
Okay, I'm going to,
I'm going to go again.

56:25.416 --> 56:26.749
And then see how you feel.

56:27.685 --> 56:31.854
I spy with my little eye a rock.

56:31.856 --> 56:33.822
A big floating rock.

56:44.502 --> 56:45.501
The Moon?

56:45.503 --> 56:47.503
-You got it!
-Mm-hmm.

56:47.505 --> 56:49.638
It really is just
a big rock, you know.

56:49.640 --> 56:52.074
-Sure is.
-Come on, then, you go.

56:52.076 --> 56:53.942
-I don't want to.
-Come on, please.

56:53.944 --> 56:56.578
It'll make everything-- I spy
is like-- It just solves--

56:56.580 --> 56:58.814
Okay, I spy with my little eye

56:59.850 --> 57:01.683
something beginning
with an orgy.

57:02.052 --> 57:03.552
Bugger, what?

57:03.554 --> 57:05.154
Yeah, over there.

57:05.856 --> 57:07.689
That field of flowers.

57:07.691 --> 57:09.191
-[Theo] Ah.
-[Hannah] They're sex organs.

57:09.193 --> 57:11.860
-Did you know that?
-[laughing] Yeah.

57:11.862 --> 57:13.996
-Horny flowers.
-Yeah, I suppose they are.

57:13.998 --> 57:16.965
-Mm.
-[laughing] That's a good one.

57:16.967 --> 57:21.737
Uh, okay, I spy with
my little eye, uh, waves.

57:21.739 --> 57:22.704
Where?

57:23.741 --> 57:26.642
We're, like,
not near an ocean at all.

57:30.014 --> 57:32.848
Oh, wires.

57:33.617 --> 57:35.684
No, no, no, no, no, ju--
No, everywhere.

57:36.620 --> 57:39.054
-Like radio waves?
-Yes!

57:39.056 --> 57:42.124
Radio waves, everywhere.
All sorts of radio waves.

57:42.126 --> 57:45.961
Big, small, soft,
hard, mean, nice.

57:45.963 --> 57:47.529
God, I wish I could feel that.

57:47.531 --> 57:49.631
You can, you can.
Already, you can.

57:49.633 --> 57:51.667
Just don't be afraid of it.

57:51.669 --> 57:54.236
We're, we're so kind of, uh,

57:54.238 --> 57:57.072
comfortable with just using our
names for everything, you know?

57:57.074 --> 57:59.208
It's like, as soon as
you name something,

57:59.210 --> 58:01.009
then it's just locked.

58:01.011 --> 58:02.845
Oh, you know, that's a chair.

58:02.847 --> 58:04.780
He's cool. She's a Carol.

58:04.782 --> 58:06.215
-[laughing]
-[chuckling] Do you
know what I mean?

58:06.217 --> 58:09.218
It's like, [chuckling]
we've constructed, like,

58:09.220 --> 58:11.186
a whole made-up world,

58:11.188 --> 58:14.122
and it stops us from seeing
everything how it really is.

58:14.124 --> 58:16.959
[light dramatic music]

58:16.961 --> 58:19.828
Yeah, you, you might be
right about that.

58:19.830 --> 58:21.063
[Theo] Yeah, yeah.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.533
But your theories don't

58:25.703 --> 58:27.669
quite add up, Theo.

58:28.038 --> 58:29.771
No, I-- Yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

58:29.773 --> 58:31.874
I admit, I do admit
there are holes

58:31.876 --> 58:36.778
but I am so, so very close.
I am so close.

58:36.780 --> 58:38.814
[Rachel on phone]<i> I mean,</i>
<i> why on earth would</i>
<i> they release him?</i>

58:38.816 --> 58:41.183
<i> -Are they morons?</i>
-[chuckling] Obviously.

58:41.752 --> 58:44.520
I don't know, 'cause the state
doesn't want to pay for him.

58:45.089 --> 58:47.089
And Theo doesn't have insurance.

58:47.091 --> 58:48.624
<i> The system is fucked here.</i>

58:48.626 --> 58:50.092
<i> It's completely broken.</i>

58:50.094 --> 58:51.960
<i> And in England it's different.</i>

58:51.962 --> 58:54.813
<i> I mean, there</i>
<i> he has health care, for one,</i>
<i> and they could keep him</i>

58:54.814 --> 58:57.665
<i> in the hospital and</i>
<i> the medication actually works.</i>

58:58.202 --> 59:02.204
Right, we need to get
him back to London.

59:04.942 --> 59:06.608
Oh, my God, wait,
he's running away.

59:06.610 --> 59:08.677
-What?
-No, right now, he just--

59:08.679 --> 59:10.312
He ran away, Theo!

59:12.683 --> 59:14.550
[voice glitching]
<i> Hannah, I can't hear you.</i>

59:15.185 --> 59:16.852
<i> Wait, Hannah,</i>
<i> what happened to Theo?</i>

59:16.854 --> 59:18.620
<i> You're breaking up.</i>

59:22.026 --> 59:24.693
[static oscillating]

59:25.629 --> 59:27.296
<i> -Hannah--</i>
-[static]

59:28.299 --> 59:30.032
<i> Hannah, are you there?</i>

59:32.970 --> 59:36.238
Must be the waves, shit.

1:00:04.868 --> 1:00:06.134
Anybody home?

1:00:12.076 --> 1:00:13.041
Yeah. [chuckling]

1:00:13.043 --> 1:00:15.344
Sorry, oh, wow,

1:00:15.346 --> 1:00:18.647
I'm like, really out of it.

1:00:18.649 --> 1:00:21.316
-Are you sick?
-No, I'm not sick.

1:00:21.318 --> 1:00:22.317
It's not that.

1:00:23.153 --> 1:00:26.688
Oh, yeah, well, I get it.

1:00:26.690 --> 1:00:28.824
Me too, I'm so wrecked.

1:00:28.826 --> 1:00:30.359
I'm so wrecked.

1:00:30.361 --> 1:00:33.395
-I was so high last night.
-[Darron] Hmm.

1:00:33.397 --> 1:00:37.633
I was totally tripping.
I like, I had to call 912.

1:00:37.635 --> 1:00:38.800
[chuckling]

1:00:40.237 --> 1:00:41.903
What's 912?

1:00:41.905 --> 1:00:45.207
It's like 911 except for

1:00:45.209 --> 1:00:48.176
when you're, like, so high
that you're just freaking out

1:00:48.178 --> 1:00:49.978
and you just need
someone to be like,

1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:52.047
"It's all right, man."

1:00:52.049 --> 1:00:54.783
-[Darron chuckles]
-"Not everybody hates you.

1:00:54.785 --> 1:00:58.787
Drink water, sit in a chair.

1:00:58.789 --> 1:01:00.822
You don't have a brain tumor."

1:01:00.824 --> 1:01:02.124
[Darron] "Your face
isn't melting."

1:01:02.126 --> 1:01:03.892
[Dana] "Your face
isn't melting."

1:01:03.894 --> 1:01:06.862
-[Darron] "You're not crazy."
-"You're not crazy."

1:01:06.864 --> 1:01:07.996
-"Definitely."
-"This is going to end.

1:01:07.998 --> 1:01:09.364
You might feel crazy right now,

1:01:09.366 --> 1:01:11.199
but you're going
to come out of it."

1:01:11.969 --> 1:01:15.070
<i> ¶ I'm so high ¶</i>

1:01:15.072 --> 1:01:20.976
<i> ¶ I don't know if</i>
<i> I'll ever not be high again ¶</i>

1:01:20.978 --> 1:01:23.111
-You know?
-[Darron] All right,
all right. I'm not mad at it.

1:01:23.113 --> 1:01:27.015
[Dana] Or maybe like,
yeah, like, like:
<i> ¶ I-I don't know ¶</i>

1:01:27.017 --> 1:01:30.686
-God, I get my best ideas
when I feel like this.
<i> -¶ Antenna tower ¶</i>

1:01:30.688 --> 1:01:32.320
<i> -¶ I hear ¶</i>
-[Darron] That's why
you're a star, sweetheart.

1:01:32.322 --> 1:01:35.123
-[Dana] That's right.
<i> -¶ The call ¶</i>

1:01:35.125 --> 1:01:37.225
[Darron] It's your special gift.

1:01:38.362 --> 1:01:43.832

-That's nice.
-[Hannah humming]

1:01:52.810 --> 1:01:53.975
I like that.

1:01:53.977 --> 1:01:56.878
<i> ¶ I could see one more ¶</i>

1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:59.381

-[Dana] Hmm, I feel that.

1:02:02.486 --> 1:02:06.488
-That is a vibe.

[Hannah] She's singing it
so differently.

1:02:28.045 --> 1:02:30.812
Your way's too clever, honey.
It ain't easy money.

1:04:28.365 --> 1:04:30.198
[woman] No, wait.

1:04:31.134 --> 1:04:32.534
I think I feel something.

1:04:33.437 --> 1:04:35.136
I just sped my heart rate up.

1:04:35.138 --> 1:04:38.573
-[Hannah] Hi, Theo, hi.
-Hey.

1:04:38.575 --> 1:04:41.943
Um... what are you doing?

1:04:42.946 --> 1:04:46.314
We are experimenting
with our frequencies.

1:04:46.316 --> 1:04:47.449
[chuckling]

1:04:48.151 --> 1:04:49.584
Try it again.

1:04:49.586 --> 1:04:52.520
Okay, okay. [breathes deeply]

1:04:54.524 --> 1:04:57.525
Give me a minute.
I think I can make this work.

1:04:57.527 --> 1:05:00.495
Um, I really don't think
that you should be
partying right now--

1:05:00.497 --> 1:05:02.931
Shh! I'm trying to concentrate.

1:05:03.967 --> 1:05:05.133
Okay.

1:05:07.337 --> 1:05:10.472
This, this, this is,
this is all wrong, right?

1:05:10.474 --> 1:05:11.973
This is, this isn't happening.

1:05:11.975 --> 1:05:14.442
-It's not right.
-Her vibe is way off.

1:05:14.444 --> 1:05:16.978
Yeah, your vibe is off.

1:05:19.416 --> 1:05:22.450
You got some harsh shit you're
packing there, little miss.

1:05:24.388 --> 1:05:25.987
You need to trim your frills

1:05:25.989 --> 1:05:27.656
or you're going to get cancer.

1:05:27.658 --> 1:05:30.492
Yeah, don't hold in stress.

1:05:30.494 --> 1:05:34.162
Yeah, act out your
impulses. [chuckling]

1:05:37.567 --> 1:05:40.001
Theo, um,
I, uh, thought that you said

1:05:40.003 --> 1:05:41.469
that you needed
to relax right now.

1:05:42.406 --> 1:05:43.705
This is relaxing.

1:05:44.274 --> 1:05:46.441
This is exactly where
I should be right now.

1:05:47.344 --> 1:05:48.376
And you.

1:05:49.713 --> 1:05:51.646
You girls are in perfect time.

1:05:53.216 --> 1:05:56.051
[whispering] You guys,
let's go to outer space.

1:05:56.520 --> 1:05:58.186
-Yes.
-Yeah.

1:05:58.188 --> 1:06:00.221
-[Hannah] What?
-[chuckling]

1:06:00.223 --> 1:06:02.490
[Theo] She said,
"Let's go to outer space."

1:06:03.293 --> 1:06:06.161
-No, no, no, no, no!
-This is going to be weird.

1:06:06.163 --> 1:06:08.129
[Theo] Come on, no!

1:06:09.099 --> 1:06:11.099
-Yeah! Yeah!
-What is that?

1:06:11.101 --> 1:06:13.401
[laughing] That's mushrooms!

1:06:13.403 --> 1:06:15.704
-No, Theo, come on. No, I--
-Yes!

1:06:15.706 --> 1:06:18.373
[Theo] It's a brill--
It's a great idea.

1:06:18.375 --> 1:06:20.575
-It's a great idea, stop.
-Don't you--

1:06:20.577 --> 1:06:22.077
-No, Theo!
-[women laughing]

1:06:22.079 --> 1:06:23.345
Tuck in, chirpy chops.

1:06:24.448 --> 1:06:27.716
-[Theo whooping]
-[laughing]

1:06:29.586 --> 1:06:31.619
-[woman] Feel it!
-[Theo] Whoa!

1:06:31.621 --> 1:06:33.421
[Cheyenne] Off to the wild side.

1:06:33.423 --> 1:06:36.424
-[Theo] It's so warm!
-[Cheyenne] You can do it.

1:06:36.426 --> 1:06:37.625
I believe in you.

1:06:37.627 --> 1:06:39.627
[light dramatic music]

1:06:42.632 --> 1:06:45.367
[whooping] Yeah!

1:06:45.369 --> 1:06:47.302
Yeah!

1:07:52.202 --> 1:07:54.736
[Hannah] Oh, man,
can you see the ghosts?

1:07:56.106 --> 1:07:58.239
[Theo] Ghosts are ripples.

1:07:58.241 --> 1:08:03.344
When we pass,
we imprint ourselves
on the atoms around us.

1:08:03.713 --> 1:08:08.249
And ghosts are memories
that electrons have.

1:08:10.353 --> 1:08:12.687
Mm, that makes sense to me.

1:08:12.689 --> 1:08:15.090
But sometimes,
what you bring with you

1:08:16.193 --> 1:08:17.292
triggers the ripple.

1:08:18.295 --> 1:08:20.228
But I don't want to bring...

1:08:22.232 --> 1:08:26.201
I don't want to bring anything
with me, I try not to.

1:08:28.371 --> 1:08:32.540
You know...
I can hear voices, too.

1:08:32.542 --> 1:08:33.708
Theo, I hear--

1:08:35.212 --> 1:08:38.780
And they're really harsh
and critical and mean.

1:08:39.449 --> 1:08:42.851
And then, I can't even hear
my own voice, you know?

1:08:42.853 --> 1:08:47.288
And, and it becomes so loud.

1:08:48.692 --> 1:08:51.793
And then it's,
it's this, this void.

1:08:54.498 --> 1:08:59.200
Well, the only way to stop
them is just let them out.

1:09:00.237 --> 1:09:02.170
You know, just ride the wave.

1:09:02.806 --> 1:09:04.472
To the shore, it's not so bad.

1:09:05.375 --> 1:09:06.341
I don't know.

1:09:07.878 --> 1:09:09.377
I don't want to do that.

1:09:10.213 --> 1:09:11.579
I don't want to feel that.

1:09:11.581 --> 1:09:13.314
Yeah, stop thinking.

1:09:14.584 --> 1:09:16.451
What are you feeling?

1:09:19.556 --> 1:09:20.688
There we go.

1:09:21.391 --> 1:09:23.291
That's it, that's it,
that's right.

1:09:23.293 --> 1:09:24.726
-[Hannah crying]
-That's right.

1:09:26.396 --> 1:09:28.763
As soon as you let
yourself feel,

1:09:28.765 --> 1:09:31.299
then the real you can just be.

1:09:31.835 --> 1:09:33.835
Without your head
getting in the way.

1:09:36.406 --> 1:09:37.539
Yeah?

1:09:38.341 --> 1:09:41.676
And that's beautiful, feel.

1:09:43.813 --> 1:09:45.780
If you can put that into your
work, then you're going to

1:09:45.782 --> 1:09:47.549
come up with
something really great.

1:09:48.685 --> 1:09:49.717
Okay?

1:09:50.353 --> 1:09:51.519
[crying] Yeah.

1:09:53.690 --> 1:09:55.323
It's the only way.

1:09:59.296 --> 1:10:00.295
[Theo] Just feel.

1:10:05.635 --> 1:10:08.269
[rock music]

1:10:47.010 --> 1:10:48.676
[Theo whooping]

1:10:57.854 --> 1:11:00.388
Watcher's watching among us.

1:11:00.857 --> 1:11:03.024
What are you looking for, son?

1:11:03.827 --> 1:11:05.660
Bring your own gold.

1:11:05.662 --> 1:11:06.961
Your own nebula.

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.400
All right, that's it!
I'm not going to run anymore!

1:11:12.402 --> 1:11:14.269
-All right,
what do you want?
-[man] What's this guy doing?

1:11:14.271 --> 1:11:16.571
Is it this, is it this?
Why don't you fucking take it?

1:11:16.573 --> 1:11:18.740
Hey, hey, Theo, Theo!

1:11:18.742 --> 1:11:20.942
-[man] That's not cool, man.
-Theo, what is happening?

1:11:20.944 --> 1:11:22.910
[man] Easy, easy.

1:11:27.550 --> 1:11:29.751
-What?
-[whispering] There's
something out there.

1:11:30.587 --> 1:11:31.719
Come on, let's go.

1:11:31.721 --> 1:11:34.355
Mm-mm, mm-mm, no.

1:11:34.724 --> 1:11:35.957
-Theo.
-No.

1:11:40.697 --> 1:11:41.929
You know what that is?

1:11:44.401 --> 1:11:47.435
[Hannah] Yeah, the observatory.

1:11:50.307 --> 1:11:51.839
It's so much more than that.

1:11:55.512 --> 1:11:56.544
Hey.

1:12:01.418 --> 1:12:02.483
Shit.

1:12:07.724 --> 1:12:10.625
Theo. Wait.

1:12:16.366 --> 1:12:18.399
Theo, where are we going?

1:12:22.906 --> 1:12:24.906
Theo, Theo!

1:12:24.908 --> 1:12:26.774
That's trespassing!

1:12:26.776 --> 1:12:28.343
[dog barking]

1:12:28.345 --> 1:12:30.011
Oh, my God, shit.

1:12:31.648 --> 1:12:32.914
Wait.

1:12:33.616 --> 1:12:34.716
Shit.

1:12:36.353 --> 1:12:37.652
[Hannah grunts]

1:12:39.356 --> 1:12:40.388
Goddamn it.

1:12:56.439 --> 1:12:57.405
Theo.

1:13:02.379 --> 1:13:04.479
[dogs barking]

1:13:05.548 --> 1:13:06.581
Theo.

1:13:10.587 --> 1:13:12.787
[helicopter whirring]

1:13:18.828 --> 1:13:20.795
[officer on speakerphone]
<i> LAPD, stop.</i>

1:13:20.797 --> 1:13:22.663
<i> Put your hands in the air.</i>

1:13:22.665 --> 1:13:24.632
-Oh, my God.
<i> -Stop, this is the police.</i>

1:13:24.634 --> 1:13:26.467
<i> Come out with your</i>
<i> hands in the air.</i>

1:13:26.469 --> 1:13:28.870
<i> Repeat, come out with</i>
<i> your hands in the air.</i>

1:13:28.872 --> 1:13:30.104
[Hannah whimpering]

1:13:30.106 --> 1:13:32.106
[inaudible chatter
on speakerphone]

1:13:37.914 --> 1:13:40.047
No, it's just
a misunderstanding, okay?

1:13:40.049 --> 1:13:43.584
We were not breaking
and entering. I was just
chasing after my friend.

1:13:43.586 --> 1:13:46.020
-Look, we were not breaking
and entering anywhere.
-I recognize you.

1:13:46.022 --> 1:13:48.156
You're like the Nazi
I met in Auschwitz.

1:13:48.158 --> 1:13:49.757
Get your fucking hands off!

1:13:49.759 --> 1:13:51.092
Fuck you! [grunting]

1:13:51.094 --> 1:13:53.494
-Oh, my God!
-[officer grunting]

1:13:53.496 --> 1:13:54.896
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:13:54.898 --> 1:13:56.998
Please don't shoot!
Please do not shoot him!

1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:58.900
-[Theo shouting]
-Do not shoot him!

1:13:58.902 --> 1:14:00.701
Hey, no, no, he's mentally ill!

1:14:00.703 --> 1:14:03.905
-[officer] Hands on the ground!
-Please, oh, my God!

1:14:03.907 --> 1:14:06.641
Uh, I have
the papers in my purse!

1:14:06.643 --> 1:14:09.877
You can get the papers
out of my purse! Please, please.

1:14:09.879 --> 1:14:13.915
He's just been diagnosed
as a chronic paranoid
schizophrenic, okay?

1:14:13.917 --> 1:14:15.483
[crying] Oh, my God.

1:14:16.653 --> 1:14:18.586
-Oh, my God.
-[Theo grunting] Oh, God!

1:14:18.588 --> 1:14:20.788
It would be the worst
place for him.

1:14:20.790 --> 1:14:22.490
What the fuck! Get off me!

1:14:22.492 --> 1:14:24.559
Get your fucking hands off me!

1:14:24.561 --> 1:14:25.860
[crying] No, no, oh, my God.

1:14:27.997 --> 1:14:31.165
No, no, please, please.

1:14:31.968 --> 1:14:34.135
-6815, we're detaining--
-Oh, my God,
he's just been diagnosed

1:14:34.137 --> 1:14:36.904
as a paranoid
schizophrenic, okay?

1:14:37.474 --> 1:14:39.640
Don't arrest him,
please don't arrest him.

1:14:39.642 --> 1:14:42.477
-He, he cannot go to jail.
-We can take him
to the hospital,

1:14:42.479 --> 1:14:44.479
but it's dangerous for him to
be out here on the streets.

1:14:44.481 --> 1:14:46.981
[crying] I know, I know,
I-- but--

1:14:47.550 --> 1:14:49.550
Please, will you
tell a doctor that?

1:14:49.986 --> 1:14:52.086
-[indistinct radio chatter]
-If that'll help, ma'am.

1:14:52.889 --> 1:14:54.922
[crying] Oh, my God, thank you.

1:14:54.924 --> 1:14:57.191
-[Theo groaning]
-[crying] Fuck.

1:15:07.737 --> 1:15:10.037
[Angus] Jesus Christ.
He looks terrible.

1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:11.772
[Hannah] I know.

1:15:12.976 --> 1:15:14.175
[Angus] God, mate.

1:15:14.844 --> 1:15:16.544
[muffled voices]

1:15:17.714 --> 1:15:18.746
[Hannah] God.

1:15:18.748 --> 1:15:21.616
[doctor] Have you been feeling
strange at all lately?

1:15:21.618 --> 1:15:23.284
[Hannah] He's so charming.

1:15:24.020 --> 1:15:25.086
I mean...

1:15:26.656 --> 1:15:28.189
These doctors, they just--

1:15:30.260 --> 1:15:31.626
[Angus] God.

1:15:33.530 --> 1:15:36.931
[Angus] Here we go again.
I tell you, these doctors,
they just don't care.

1:15:36.933 --> 1:15:39.534
They just want him
in and out of here
as quickly as they can.

1:15:39.536 --> 1:15:41.903
[doctor] Adrenal fatigue
can be quite draining.

1:15:41.905 --> 1:15:43.237
[sighing]

1:15:44.173 --> 1:15:45.706
Any thoughts of suicide?

1:15:45.708 --> 1:15:50.711
Uh, only if you can die from
embarrassment. [chuckling]

1:15:53.149 --> 1:15:55.049
-[Angus] What,
is he drawing something?
-[Hannah] Damn it.

1:15:55.051 --> 1:15:56.651
[Angus] What's he doing?

1:15:56.653 --> 1:15:58.085
What is he doing?

1:16:08.064 --> 1:16:09.730
[light dramatic music]

1:16:09.732 --> 1:16:11.766
[Theo] That's the symbol
for the society.

1:16:12.802 --> 1:16:14.235
How do you know about that?

1:16:15.004 --> 1:16:16.237
Are you a member?

1:16:16.773 --> 1:16:19.607
'Cause I, I haven't
seen you before.

1:16:21.077 --> 1:16:22.843
[whispering] And we
need to debrief you.

1:16:27.350 --> 1:16:29.350
Those feather pricks have
been trying to stop me

1:16:29.352 --> 1:16:31.152
from erasing
all the negative energy

1:16:31.154 --> 1:16:32.887
that's accumulated in the world,

1:16:32.889 --> 1:16:34.989
from all the terrible
events throughout history.

1:16:36.192 --> 1:16:38.292
We've gone ahead
and admitted him to a 5250.

1:16:38.294 --> 1:16:39.894
[both sighing]

1:16:39.896 --> 1:16:42.863
-[Hannah excitedly crying]
-[Angus laughing]

1:16:45.702 --> 1:16:47.602
-How, how did you know...
-Thank you very much.

1:16:47.604 --> 1:16:49.904
-...to do that?
-We use the LEAP method here.

1:16:49.906 --> 1:16:52.273
There's listen, empathize,
agree and partner.

1:16:52.275 --> 1:16:56.811
It rebuilds trust,
and eventually they trust you
enough to listen to your advice.

1:16:56.813 --> 1:17:00.982
Oh, so, you just, you, you go
along with him? [chuckling]

1:17:00.984 --> 1:17:03.317
It's clear that he can become
violent when under stress,

1:17:03.319 --> 1:17:05.319
and his police record indicates

1:17:05.321 --> 1:17:07.221
that he has a restraining
order out on him.

1:17:07.223 --> 1:17:10.324
-What?
-By a, a...

1:17:11.928 --> 1:17:15.630
-a Wendi Sotto.
-Oh, Christ, yeah. [sighing]

1:17:15.632 --> 1:17:17.665
That's the girl Theo was seeing.

1:17:17.667 --> 1:17:20.668
Whenever he has these slips,
he becomes obsessed with her,

1:17:20.670 --> 1:17:22.670

My name's Hannah.

I'm a friend of Theo's.

1:27:23.939 --> 1:27:25.739
He's obsessed with me.

1:27:27.476 --> 1:27:29.443
You're the princess of time.

1:27:30.279 --> 1:27:33.647
[scoffs] You guys got
to stop saying that.

1:27:34.416 --> 1:27:35.916
Okay, sorry.

1:27:38.587 --> 1:27:42.556
Somehow, I got wrapped up
in his illusions.

He started coming to the store.

1:27:47.363 --> 1:27:48.996
I had to hide
in the changing room

1:27:48.998 --> 1:27:50.897
while my employees
talked to him.

1:27:51.967 --> 1:27:54.768
But he would just straight
come to the one I was in.

1:27:56.305 --> 1:27:59.573
It's just like, he knows.

1:28:05.047 --> 1:28:07.814
Sometimes I think he's
actually tapped into something.

1:28:08.851 --> 1:28:12.286
Well, I wish he would
leave me out of it.

1:28:14.623 --> 1:28:16.490

1:28:47.423 --> 1:28:51.725
You feel that, right?
We, we create time.

1:28:51.727 --> 1:28:56.063

the shape of reality

1:28:56.065 --> 1:28:58.065

else possible.

anywhere to protect you.

for you, right?

1:29:56.492 --> 1:29:59.493
Right, Theo, I've been offered
this job in London.
