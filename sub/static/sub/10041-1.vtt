just two weeks old--

(thunder rumbling)
You were both crying

36:55.914 --> 36:58.349
and I took you downstairs.

36:58.416 --> 36:59.751
Your father was working
in the study

36:59.818 --> 37:01.853
and I asked him to check in
on your brother.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.689
And he was distracted
just for a few minutes,

37:04.756 --> 37:06.892
and he went in, and...

37:08.693 --> 37:10.728
...Tom...

37:15.266 --> 37:17.903
...he was gone.

37:19.604 --> 37:21.773
What, kidnapped?

37:21.840 --> 37:24.843
They-they searched for months,

37:24.910 --> 37:27.979
and we... (sighs)
we hoped for years,

37:28.046 --> 37:32.350

37:32.417 --> 37:33.785

37:33.852 --> 37:36.254

01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:57.461
(horse huffs)

01:04:57.527 --> 01:04:59.062
The height
of my power approaches,

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:01.064
yet still the boy collects,

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:04.233
and now holds, three signs.

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.902
You know what you must do.

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:10.173
But understand, you are not
the only one I've enlisted,

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:13.042
so deliver on your promise,
or I shall deliver on mine.

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:18.114
(neighing)

01:05:18.181 --> 01:05:19.983
Seeker!

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:21.985
Witness my wrath!

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:24.120
(horse neighing)

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:27.924
(crows cawing)

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.697
(rumbling grows louder
as cawing fades)

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:39.869
(wind whistling)

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:49.946
GREYTHORNE:
Our Seeker has very little time.

01:05:50.013 --> 01:05:51.715
Perhaps not enough.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.620
Throw it on the back!
Leave it!

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:58.788
(indistinct shouts)

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:08.998
(siren blaring)

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:12.235
(woman screams)

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:15.038
(ominous theme plays)

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:17.473
(wind rushing)

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:27.551
(horse huffing)

01:06:32.522 --> 01:06:34.624
WOMAN: Come along,
Colin, quickly!

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:37.060
Let's get out of
this terrible weather!

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:39.929
(wind whistling)

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.401
They're completely out of food!

01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:48.437
There's none left!

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:50.239
We're gonna have to eat
whatever Mom's got

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:52.008
in the freezer.

01:06:52.075 --> 01:06:53.242
Come on.

01:06:55.712 --> 01:06:57.581
Max, are you all right?

01:06:57.647 --> 01:06:59.616
You know, about your room...

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:03.452
It's gonna be more
than a couple of weeks.

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:06.255
Yeah? Yeah, okay, whatever.

01:07:07.591 --> 01:07:09.626
(deep, British accent):
Whatever?

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.928
I'm sick and tired
of your attitude.

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:13.997
Little remarks, things
you're saying behind my back

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:16.199
when you're trying to turn
everybody against me--

01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:17.667
you think I don't see that?

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:20.203
Max? Max, what's going on?

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:21.805
You've got issues, Will.

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:25.742
You want to sort 'em out?

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:36.385
(whooshing)

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:38.822
(people shouting indistinctly)

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:42.926
(Max laughing)

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:44.728
WOMAN:
Get off the table!

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:47.130
Well, well, what do
we have here, huh?

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:48.798
You sense a sign, is that
what we're doing here, huh,

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.433
Seeker?
Max, you're getting weird.

01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:51.567
Dude, this isn't really you.

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:52.636
(normal voice):
Oh, really? It isn't?

01:07:52.702 --> 01:07:54.470
Is this real enough for you?!

01:07:54.537 --> 01:07:55.905
(grunting)

01:07:59.643 --> 01:08:02.545
(Will grunts)
(distorted, echoing yell)

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:03.847
(grunts)

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.849
(villagers chattering)

01:08:08.718 --> 01:08:10.987
MAN 1:
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:08:11.054 --> 01:08:12.288
Gather round...

01:08:12.355 --> 01:08:14.290
MAN 2: Gather round me!
...for the main event!

01:08:14.357 --> 01:08:15.591
MAN 2:
For the main event.

01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:17.961
We have the champion!

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:19.562
(loud cheers)

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:22.098
MAN 1: And challenging
our champion today,

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:23.265
the challenger!

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:25.868
(crowd jeering)

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.671
(bells tinkling)
MAN 1: Ladies and gentlemen,

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:30.305
fame, fortune
and happiness await you!

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:34.042
(husky grunt)

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:37.145
(laughing)

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:42.151
MAX:
Where's the sign?!

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:45.854
(bells clanking)

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.157
MAN 1:
Get him out!

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:50.593
I want him out of here!

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:51.995
(gasps)

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.162
WILL: Put-put-put me down!
Put me down!

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:56.165
(gasps)

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:00.169
(Will yells)

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:01.370
You jumped through time!

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:03.471
You sense a sign?

01:09:03.538 --> 01:09:05.975
Give me the signs.

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:10.446
(laughs):
Give me all the signs.

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:12.381
I...

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:15.283
hate to do this

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.821
to my own brother,
but you're not giving me

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:21.157
any choice, so I'm
gonna count to ten.

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:22.491
One...

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:24.593
Max! Okay, it doesn't matter
two...

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.729
about college.

01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:26.830
Three!
That's why

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:28.497
your stuff's in boxes.
(laughs): What?

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.133
Because you're not going back.

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:31.434
Four!

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.667
Because you dropped out.

01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:33.903
Five.
So what?

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:37.372
Mom and Dad will understand.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.474
Six.

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.009
The Dark is using you, Max.

01:09:40.076 --> 01:09:40.877
Seven.

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:42.411
It is using your fear.

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:43.912
You flunked some exams.

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.314
(Max chuckles)
So what?

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.483
Big deal.
It's how you deal with it, Max.

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:48.617
Eight.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:50.419
And you don't have
to deal with it alone.

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:51.254
Your family loves you.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:52.520
Ni...

01:09:52.587 --> 01:09:53.957
nine.

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.825
Max...

01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:58.694
I hate to do this
to my own brother.

01:09:58.762 --> 01:10:01.798
(grunts)

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:05.334
(surprised laugh)

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:09.305
The champion!
(crowd cheering)

01:10:18.281 --> 01:10:19.983
Champion. 1690.

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.422
(mysterious theme playing)

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:28.491
(mystical whirring, tinkling)

01:10:30.426 --> 01:10:32.595
(gasps softly)

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:35.098
(laughs)

01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:39.468
(groans)

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:41.337
You all right?
My head hurts.

01:10:42.638 --> 01:10:44.774
What happened?

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:46.742
You fell.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:59.222
(gentle theme playing)

01:11:00.389 --> 01:11:01.390
MAX:
Hey, uh, Dad?

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:03.192
What? Yeah?

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.961
You got a sec?

01:11:07.496 --> 01:11:08.832
Yeah. Come on in.

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:18.774
(bell clanging)

01:11:18.842 --> 01:11:24.213
(train whistle blows
in distance)

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:35.491
(door opens)
(man laughing)

01:11:35.558 --> 01:11:38.461
It won't be stealing--
we'll leave some money, eh?

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:40.496
Or rather, you will.

01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:41.664
How about a wager, George?

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:42.798
A flagon of ale.

01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:43.900
GEORGE:
Eh.

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:45.601
Nice try, Mr. Dawson.

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:46.802
(laughing)

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.404
Dragons, indeed!

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:49.906
Anyways, shame to leave

01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:52.541
the old place
all quiet and lonesome.

01:11:52.608 --> 01:11:55.378
THE RIDER:
Off-duty, gentlemen?

01:11:55.444 --> 01:11:58.081
(ominous theme plays)

01:11:59.448 --> 01:12:00.683
Very careless.

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:02.785
Straying out
at a time like this.

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:04.453
We're here for a wager, Rider.

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.990
And we'll take you up
on yours as well.

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:09.959
Oh, you Old Ones.

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:13.396
You're not scared
of anything, are you?

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:16.765
Well, that's good.

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:19.602
That's going to make it
so much easier.

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:22.038
(thunderous boom)

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:23.839
(eerie, distorted neighing)

01:12:23.907 --> 01:12:26.342
(raspy huffing)

01:12:26.409 --> 01:12:27.576
(crows cawing)

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:32.048
(cawing, screeching)

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:34.951
(screeching)

01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:38.321
(men yelling)

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:40.589
(wind gusting)

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:47.296
(wind rushing, whistling)

01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:55.571
(wind whistling,
whipping outside)

01:12:55.638 --> 01:12:57.106
(gas hissing, flame crackling)

01:12:58.774 --> 01:12:59.976
ANNOUNCER:
The government has declared

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:01.377
a state of emergency.
Here, here, here.

01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:03.446
Attempts are
being made to deliver

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:06.249
essential supplies to the
most severely affected areas.

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:09.152
Experts believe
the current conditions

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:12.121
will last for at least
another week...

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:13.422
You guys, Miss Greythorne

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:15.491
has invited everybody
in the village

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.293
to come stay at the manor.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.362
They have their own
generator there,

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:20.363
their own food,

01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:23.832
fuel-- which is more
than we can say we have.

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.201
MOM:
That was the last

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:27.170
of our soup heated
on the last of our gas.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.005
Okay, that's it--
we pack our bags tonight.

01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:31.174
Tomorrow morning we go.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.942
But what if
the weatherman's wrong?

01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:34.143
WILL:
He is.

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:35.744
The storm will peak in two days.

01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:38.014
That's all we have.

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:40.616
If it doesn't get better
by then...

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:42.285
it never will.

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:52.195
(wind whipping,
whistling outside)

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.766
Just, um...
just thinking out loud.

01:13:57.833 --> 01:14:00.036
(quiet, mysterious
theme playing)

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:02.405
(Will slurps,
sets spoon in bowl)

01:14:06.342 --> 01:14:08.277
It's "The Light
and the Dark."

01:14:08.344 --> 01:14:09.812
Is this what you were working on

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:11.947
the night...
Tom disappeared?

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:20.023
I should have been
caring for you boys.

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:22.158
Instead, I was...

01:14:22.225 --> 01:14:26.862
My work-- Will, I-I thought
I was onto something great,

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:28.197
a... a revelation.

01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:29.999
It was just
an obsession, though.

01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:32.635
It was like I was being...

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:33.669
(baby crying)

01:14:33.736 --> 01:14:35.071
...being pushed to unlock

01:14:35.138 --> 01:14:36.639
this darkness;
I couldn't stop it.

01:14:36.705 --> 01:14:38.141
And I lost myself.

01:14:40.009 --> 01:14:41.877
(thunder crashing)
And worse...

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:43.712
I lost Tom.

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:46.415
It was my fault.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.284
Dad, Dad...

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:50.619
Dad, it wasn't your fault.

01:14:56.459 --> 01:15:00.096
(Stantons talking in distance)
(wind rushing)

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:02.165
No. No, no, no. Stay.

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:04.967
(Gwen shouting)
Guys, guys! No! Stay!

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:06.869
DAD:
Let 'em go! They'll be fine!

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:09.638
Come on!

01:15:14.043 --> 01:15:15.844
Now, you have four signs.
Yes.

01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:17.046
The other two.

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:18.614
Look, I'll find them, okay?

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.349
Will, tomorrow is what?

01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:21.517
Will!

01:15:21.584 --> 01:15:24.887
Will! Tomorrow is
the final day.

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:26.355
Yeah, I know--
but even if

01:15:26.422 --> 01:15:28.023
I find the fifth sign, I have

01:15:28.091 --> 01:15:30.826
no idea how to find the sixth.

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:33.262
When I first saw you,
I thought, no,

01:15:33.329 --> 01:15:34.630
a boy, not a warrior.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:35.998
I was wrong.

01:15:36.065 --> 01:15:37.500
You've come a long way,

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:39.868
both as the Seeker

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:41.837
and as Will Stanton.

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:46.242
I believe in you, Will--
you'll find what you need.

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:48.144
Now, where are we strongest?
The Great Hall.

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:49.878
If the Dark reaches
its peak, meet us there.

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:51.514
I can't leave my family.

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:54.517
The only way to help your family
is to defeat the Dark.

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:56.219
It's our only hope.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:04.493
(wind whistling outside)

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:07.763
Wh-Where's George?

01:16:10.433 --> 01:16:14.537
Our enemy knows no mercy.

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:18.574
(neighs)

01:16:21.844 --> 01:16:24.547
(wood creaks)

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:26.282
(harsh neighing)

01:16:29.118 --> 01:16:32.121
(neighs)

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:35.124
Your tricks can only delay,

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:36.992
and you have just
trapped yourselves.

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:40.729
ANNOUNCER: We are currently
experiencing a temporary calm

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:43.031
in what the Meteorological
Office describes as

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:46.068
"the most ferocious storm
ever recorded."

01:16:46.135 --> 01:16:48.204
Reports from
around the world say

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:49.805
the worst is yet to come.
(kitten purring)

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:51.274
Arctic winds

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.876
bringing more snow are expected
to cause major disruptions

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:56.912
in northern England,
and further south, to London,

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:59.582
by tomorrow morning.

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:01.284
(distorted neighing)

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:05.488
Now with the darkness
comes the cold.

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:07.790
(neighing)

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:09.992
(thudding, rumbling)

01:17:10.058 --> 01:17:13.596
(crackling)

01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:15.097
(muffled thudding)

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:17.266
(grunting)

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:20.135
(wind whistling, whipping)

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:28.844
(wind quiets suddenly)
(soft crackling)

01:17:30.546 --> 01:17:31.914
(neighs)

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:36.219
(soft crackling)

01:17:36.285 --> 01:17:38.721
(loud, distorted neighing)

01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:40.756
(amplified heartbeat)

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:41.957
(gasps)

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:44.159
(shivering breaths)

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:51.334
(deep whoosh)

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.770
THE RIDER (echoing):
Give me the signs, Will.

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:57.139
Give me the signs or I will hurt

01:17:57.206 --> 01:18:00.209
those who are dear to you.

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:02.678
WILL:
Leave us alone.

01:18:02.745 --> 01:18:06.749
THE RIDER: Do you want to
ever go home with them again?

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:10.819
Give me the signs,
and they will live.

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:13.789
(soft crackling)
Give me the signs, Will.

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:15.090
(shivering)

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:16.392
WILL:
No!

01:18:22.298 --> 01:18:24.300
(cracking)

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:28.404
W... Look out!

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:32.074
(yells)

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:33.108
(grunts)

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:35.544
(panicked shouts)

01:18:36.979 --> 01:18:38.247
Greythorne!

01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:39.915
(Greythorne gasps)

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:43.286
(screaming)

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:46.054
Come, child!

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:48.324
THE RIDER:
Do you love your family?

01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:49.325
Do you care about them?

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:50.826
Give me the signs,

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:53.362
or I will choose for you.

01:18:53.429 --> 01:18:55.398
Mary... Mary!
WILL: Dad?

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:58.267
(ice crackling)
What...?

01:18:58.334 --> 01:19:00.403
(panicked shouts)
Boys, get under the stairs!

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:02.938
(sword whooshes)
(panicked shouts)

01:19:03.005 --> 01:19:04.239
Look out!

01:19:04.307 --> 01:19:07.175
(grunting)

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:10.145
(distorted neighing)

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:12.315
The boy is more capable

01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:13.716
than I thought.

01:19:13.782 --> 01:19:14.983
Return to him.

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:17.052
Bring me the signs,

01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:18.987
and you will never age.

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:26.662
MOM: Are you all right?
Thank God you're safe.

01:19:26.729 --> 01:19:28.997
(everyone murmuring anxiously)

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:30.533
(blade scraping)

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.436
(huffs)

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:37.906
THE RIDER: Now let water
finish what ice has begun.

01:19:40.443 --> 01:19:43.512
(water rushing, burbling)

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:52.888
(townsfolk
murmuring, whispering)

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:54.390
(water flowing, dripping)

01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:57.793
(gasps, pants)

01:20:05.568 --> 01:20:07.035
Just-just
stay together.

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:09.304
Stay together here.

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:16.412
(panicked chatter)

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.484
Will.

01:20:22.485 --> 01:20:23.586
Come with me.

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:26.422
You're not safe here.

01:20:36.732 --> 01:20:38.801
You need to give me the signs.

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:41.136
No, they're my responsibility--
I can handle them.

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:42.538
Let me protect them for you.

01:20:42.605 --> 01:20:43.939
I don't think I can do that.

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:45.941
It's me, Will.

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:49.344
Maggie.

01:20:49.412 --> 01:20:51.980
Do you believe what you said?

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:54.883
That we're connected?

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:56.885
(laughs):
Yeah.

01:20:58.186 --> 01:21:00.489
I felt it, too.

01:21:00.556 --> 01:21:05.193
You need to give me the signs
before it's too late.

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:07.362
You need to trust me.

01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:10.599
Do you trust me?

01:21:17.473 --> 01:21:19.708
Yeah, I trust you.

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:26.849
(gentle tinkling)

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:31.386
(slow, ethereal theme playing)

01:21:40.195 --> 01:21:42.565
♪ ♪

01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:55.110
♪ ♪

01:21:55.177 --> 01:21:57.212
Hurry, witch.

01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:00.248
With another sign,
he will undo you.

01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:01.917
(firmly):
Give me

01:22:01.984 --> 01:22:03.786
the signs.

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:07.122
(frustrated yell):
Just give me the signs!

01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:09.024
No!

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:09.958
(grunts)

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:12.595
(grunts loudly)

01:22:13.496 --> 01:22:14.930
(glass shatters)

01:22:25.373 --> 01:22:26.875
(husky neighing)

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:34.449
(cawing)

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:47.530
(screaming, gasping)

01:22:50.032 --> 01:22:51.734
(screaming, grunting)

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:04.179
(mysterious, suspenseful
theme laying)

01:23:09.051 --> 01:23:12.988
THE RIDER: You have failed
me for the last time.

01:23:17.793 --> 01:23:19.728
Oh! Give me the signs!

01:23:19.795 --> 01:23:20.996
No!

01:23:21.063 --> 01:23:23.932
MAGGIE (distorted):
Give me the signs!

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.968
(yells)

01:23:27.269 --> 01:23:29.004
(screaming)

01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:37.479
LYON: Hang on!
MOM: Over here!

01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:39.948
I'm coming!
We're under the stairs!

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:43.318
Help me!

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:45.788
Oh, help!
Get us out of here!

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:54.529
(mystical whirring)

01:23:54.597 --> 01:23:56.865
(neighs)

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:03.138
(deep whooshing)

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:06.975
(echoing boom)

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:10.045
(dark cloud whooshing)
(hoofbeats thundering)

01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:19.888
(loud rumbling)

01:24:22.457 --> 01:24:24.593
(wind whipping, whistling)

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:27.095
(eerie screeching)

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:38.340
(rumbling, debris clattering)

01:24:39.608 --> 01:24:42.811
The Rider's
reached full strength,

01:24:42.878 --> 01:24:45.213
but he can't enter here
unless we let him.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.816
Merriman, I still
don't have the sixth sign.

01:24:47.883 --> 01:24:50.886
Keep the faith, Will.
You'll find it, I know you will.

01:24:50.953 --> 01:24:53.989
MOM (crying):
Will! Will!

01:24:54.056 --> 01:24:58.026
DAD: Will! Will, let us in!
Please, Will, let us in!

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:00.863
Dad, is that you?
Don't listen, Will.

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:01.897
DAD:
It's your mother, Will!

01:25:01.964 --> 01:25:03.098
GWEN:
She's hurt real bad!

01:25:03.165 --> 01:25:04.566
Gwen, is that you?

01:25:04.633 --> 01:25:05.600
LYON:
Don't listen!

01:25:05.668 --> 01:25:07.269
(echoing moans and sobs)

01:25:07.335 --> 01:25:08.671
Will, don't listen!

01:25:08.737 --> 01:25:10.305
MOM:
Help me, Will!

01:25:10.372 --> 01:25:12.307
Mom! Mom!

01:25:16.011 --> 01:25:19.147
DAD:
Open this door, Will!

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:22.350
Don't open the door!

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:25.020
Don't... open the door!

01:25:25.087 --> 01:25:27.222
MOM (sobbing):
Help me! Open the door!

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:29.324
(grunts)

01:25:29.391 --> 01:25:32.060

(whooshing)

01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:42.170
(huffs)

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:43.505
(gasps)

01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:45.307
MOM'S VOICE:
Thank you, Will.

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:49.111
(The Rider roaring)

01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:51.847

(panting)
(hooves trotting)

01:26:02.958 --> 01:26:05.160
THE RIDER:
Where are your guardians now?

01:26:05.227 --> 01:26:06.194
(neighs)

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:12.400
THE RIDER: Have they
abandoned their Seeker?

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:15.738
(crows screeching)
Did you disappoint them, Will?

01:26:15.804 --> 01:26:18.640
THE RIDER:
A thousand years of waiting,

01:26:18.707 --> 01:26:20.475
and what was there to show?
Nothing!

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:21.944
(Will groans)
Nothing but a boy

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:25.047
who could not do
what was asked of him.

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:28.183
Generations of hope and promise,
all a waste.

01:26:30.252 --> 01:26:31.954
(panting)

01:26:33.255 --> 01:26:35.457
(booming)

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:38.060
You know, I have something here
you might recognize.

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:40.062
(horse huffs)

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:42.497
Once before,
I made you an offer, Will.

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:44.699
Now here it is again.

01:26:44.767 --> 01:26:46.802
Give me the signs,
and the boy will live.

01:26:46.869 --> 01:26:49.137
I'm not afraid to die.

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:50.338
(huffing)

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:52.407
I'm not afraid to die!

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:55.243
Who says it's you?

01:26:58.146 --> 01:26:59.882
Tom?

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:02.550
Yes. Poor little Tom.

01:27:02.617 --> 01:27:04.452
The wrong twin.

01:27:04.519 --> 01:27:05.888
My prisoner

You're Will Stanton.

You are... the Seeker!

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:16.664
Give them to me.

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.100
No!

the sixth sign,
