00:08.772 --> 00:14.857
Gentlemen. Vegetables have
threaten man for generations.

00:14.923 --> 00:21.339
I have obtained funds
to solve this vegetable nightmare.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.132
- Hey, um...
- Behold!

00:23.133 --> 00:26.717
Uh, Dr. Weird? I thought that grant
was for something to like cure diseases...

00:26.762 --> 00:29.584
The grant? What is that?

00:29.605 --> 00:34.853
- Uh...
- Shut up. Behold! The Rabbot!

00:39.115 --> 00:40.322
Um, Dr. Weird...

00:40.323 --> 00:42.490
Now bring me my large french perfume

00:42.536 --> 00:46.115
and spray him in the eyes because
thats how it happened to me!

00:48.266 --> 00:51.116
Now you feel pretty don't you?

00:54.422 --> 00:56.968
The Rabbot! My creation!

00:59.006 --> 01:02.105
What has science done?!

01:55.106 --> 01:57.160
What happened to my freaking car?!

01:58.076 --> 02:00.158
Good morning, Carl. How's it going?

02:00.159 --> 02:04.470
Oh, yeah. Good morning to you there,
Mr. food monster, this is hows it's going.

02:04.814 --> 02:09.637
Look at my freaking car.
It is crushed to bejesus and back.

02:10.838 --> 02:12.284
Have you gotten any estimates?

02:12.285 --> 02:18.050
Aw, for the freaking-I just found it this way!
I just walked out here for freaking sake!

02:18.051 --> 02:22.354
Carl. It's ok. It's cool man. I'm a detective.

02:22.783 --> 02:24.678
Clear the crime scene and let me think!

02:27.585 --> 02:30.823
Meteors did it! That'll be 20 dollars.

02:30.888 --> 02:33.877
- Hey, Carl.
- Great, we got the fry-man up there.

02:33.944 --> 02:36.685
I have not called for you, Frylock.
What are you doing here?

02:37.185 --> 02:37.956
I live here.

02:38.121 --> 02:41.095
Well, quit hovering. I am the leader!

02:41.096 --> 02:44.086
Man, your car is messed up.
How are you going to get to work, Carl?

02:44.094 --> 02:45.212
I work out of the home.

02:45.213 --> 02:47.022
Frylock, send Carl to work!

02:47.023 --> 02:50.962
Then we shall solve this mystery
and make 20 dollars!

02:50.963 --> 02:54.588
Do no point that fry thing at me.
Aw, geez...

02:55.474 --> 02:58.240
Quickly Carl, the ray is upon you.
Where do you work?

02:58.241 --> 03:01.673
I done told you, I work out of the home.
Now stop with the freak beam!

03:01.697 --> 03:05.930
- Send Carl to the home, then!
- To the home!

03:06.040 --> 03:07.199
Stay out of my pool!

03:09.856 --> 03:12.332
Ow my hip! My hip...

03:12.685 --> 03:15.078
Ok. That'll be 20 dollars.

03:15.512 --> 03:17.414
So, what now, Shake?

03:17.538 --> 03:20.689
We shall solve the mystery
from Carl's Pool.

03:20.762 --> 03:22.089
Don't go in my pool.

03:22.111 --> 03:23.090
Go to the bank.

03:24.726 --> 03:28.377
This is a fun pool.
I do like splashing.

03:28.428 --> 03:32.566
Yes. Playing is for pleasure.
We should have a pool.

03:33.066 --> 03:35.473
Make us one from the sky.
I command it!

03:35.476 --> 03:36.919
Yeah. Yeah I'll do that.

03:38.930 --> 03:40.548
Seriously, I do command it.

03:41.068 --> 03:43.146
I wonder who killed Carl's car.

03:43.153 --> 03:45.390
A car cannot be killed!

03:46.033 --> 03:52.612
It was murdered by someone who
is jealous of Carl's ability to drive.

03:53.646 --> 03:56.543
Jealousy is the motivation!
Wake the Meatwad!

03:56.613 --> 03:59.721
Man, everybody knows meat don't sleep!

04:05.314 --> 04:09.108
Who-who-who-whoa!
Wake up, Meatwad!

04:10.963 --> 04:12.914
Good Morning, Frylock, how you doing?

04:13.075 --> 04:14.015
Good Morning, Meatwad.

04:14.156 --> 04:16.982
This is a good beat,
why ain't you dancing?

04:20.836 --> 04:25.720
Dancing is forbidden. It is
mystery time we have a case to solve.

04:25.803 --> 04:27.884
Aqua Teen Hunger
Force assemble!

04:28.376 --> 04:29.712
- Now look.
- Can I go swimming?

04:29.722 --> 04:32.675
It's clear to me that meteors
have destroyed Carl's car.

04:32.681 --> 04:35.471
- Can I go swimming?
- But he's committed to give us 20 dollars.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.498
- Can I go swimming?
- So what I propose we do

04:37.999 --> 04:40.545
- is to spend that money now.
- Can I go swimming?

04:40.584 --> 04:42.138
Before he has time to take it back.

04:42.189 --> 04:43.955
And we're going to spend it on what?

04:45.416 --> 04:48.188
- Candies.
- Hey, Master Shake, can I go swimming?

04:48.236 --> 04:51.513
Look Meatwad.
This is Carl's pool, not yours.

04:51.648 --> 04:54.976
You can't just decide to go
swimming whenever you want.

04:55.314 --> 04:56.925
But you're swimming right now.

04:57.017 --> 05:01.376
What I'm doing is merely swirling
the water about. That's not a crime!

05:01.404 --> 05:03.588
Uh, Shake. We swam enough
now, haven't we?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.278
Shouldn't we get going on this mystery?

05:05.545 --> 05:07.308
Let's do it tomorrow.
It's supposed to snow tomorrow.

05:07.315 --> 05:08.315
No. We'll do it now.

05:08.346 --> 05:13.964
Fine! Aqua Teens assemble
cause Frylock baby has to have it!

05:21.744 --> 05:24.360
Come on! Today.

05:25.166 --> 05:26.719
Hey, it's going down.

05:27.129 --> 05:29.653
Keep pressing it. Keep pressing it!

05:33.717 --> 05:36.442
- Why do you keep pressing it?
- I'm not doing anything.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.678
Well, hoorah.
Now I have to go to the bathroom.

05:45.065 --> 05:47.921
Shake. You know you don't
have a bathroom, baby.

05:54.131 --> 05:55.025
Where are we going?

05:55.031 --> 05:57.765
Shut your deformed mouth,
Meatwad, before I nail it shut.

05:57.873 --> 06:00.443
I will be the one
asking the questions.

06:03.848 --> 06:06.113
Come on! Go! Will you just go?!

06:06.154 --> 06:09.277
My Frydar is picking up an
unusual scent off Carl's car.

06:09.326 --> 06:11.476
It is the scent of jealousy. Clearly.

06:11.482 --> 06:13.488
It smells to me like perfume.

06:13.494 --> 06:14.720
What? What did I just tell you?

06:14.836 --> 06:17.947
I was not put on this earth
to listen to meat.

06:18.014 --> 06:19.578
Frylock, were you?

06:19.579 --> 06:21.288
- It is perfume.
- Didn't think so.

06:21.294 --> 06:24.622
Whoever killed Carl's car
was smelling real good.

06:24.643 --> 06:28.288
Whatever, just follow it.
Come on! The scent! Do it!

06:52.670 --> 06:55.020
Slow down, Meatwad!
You'll get us all killed!

06:55.152 --> 06:58.088
You want to get us all killed?
Because you're gonna do it.

06:58.557 --> 07:03.896
Keep going the way you're going.
Oh, yeah. Keep going. Brilliant.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.174
The scent seems to be coming
from that mall.

07:06.211 --> 07:07.057
I know.

07:07.085 --> 07:10.303
- Alright! I want some jeans!
- I'm the one that wants some jeans!

07:11.443 --> 07:15.285
What are you doing? What's taking
so long? Why are we still here?

07:15.444 --> 07:16.985
I'm analyzing the scent.

07:17.138 --> 07:20.434
How did you get back there?
That's for sales persons only.

07:20.718 --> 07:22.835
I wanna get back there.
Get me back there.

07:24.032 --> 07:27.688
Here. Take the meat bridge.
It's right here.

07:30.645 --> 07:32.813
Meat bridge? No.

07:36.606 --> 07:38.678
Well, fine. Don't take the meat bridge.

07:38.751 --> 07:41.317
How close are we to avenging
the death of Carl's car

07:41.378 --> 07:44.517
and please say soon,
because I am bored.

07:44.574 --> 07:47.687
A large quantity of hair growth formula
is missing from this counter.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.900
Well, as long as we
don't go back to the lab.

07:51.014 --> 07:52.193
I need to go back to the lab.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.886
God! That'll take a thousand hours!

07:54.955 --> 07:58.836
What sort of twisted fiend would need
this much hair growth formula.

07:58.908 --> 08:04.326
It's a perfume counter! Obviously,
a woman did it! Now let's go!

08:04.363 --> 08:06.721
Oooh. Hey, Frylock look at this!

08:06.784 --> 08:09.188
You get away from that.
That's an emergency exit

08:09.225 --> 08:12.097
and if you set the alarm and
get everyone of us in trouble

08:12.168 --> 08:15.475
you'll be the one
to go to prison. Not us!

08:15.583 --> 08:16.662
That could be a clue.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.326
It has nothing to do with this!
What's the matter with you.

08:19.475 --> 08:20.327
I found it.

08:20.335 --> 08:22.630
You'll find the back
of my hand very displeasing.

08:22.746 --> 08:24.638
- Now roll on over here.
- No, I'm not.

08:24.660 --> 08:27.232
- Right next to my hand.
- I ain't done nothing to you!

08:27.333 --> 08:29.097
Why are these jeans all covered in hair?

08:29.172 --> 08:33.770
Why is anything anything?
That is the style from L.A.

08:34.114 --> 08:38.352
And that is where my manager
lives. And my agent. Ok?

08:41.241 --> 08:42.241
The case is solved.

08:42.332 --> 08:44.553
The case is solved. Yeah, right.

08:53.354 --> 08:55.996
Shake aren't you even curious
about the hole in the wall,

08:56.077 --> 08:57.822
the hairy jeans, all that missing

08:57.823 --> 08:59.394
- hair growth formula?
- No, I don't think so.

08:59.754 --> 09:03.025
The case is solved. It was meteors.
Meteors did it.

09:03.055 --> 09:04.389
I thought you said a woman did it.

09:04.428 --> 09:06.395
A woman, a meteor, whatever.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.756
Carl doesn't know!
We're the detectives.

09:13.714 --> 09:15.330
Shake, did you see that?

09:15.388 --> 09:18.882
That Afro pick? Yes!
And it's mine. I called it! Get away!

09:20.946 --> 09:27.834
Whoa! No! No! I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna... Oh, no!

09:31.766 --> 09:33.116
I'm beatiful!

09:33.524 --> 09:36.337
Oh, look at me Frylock! I'm beautiful.

09:37.752 --> 09:39.675
I like the length.
Makes me look a little wild.

09:39.680 --> 09:43.808
Look, that rabbit is the thing that
killed Carl's car and we need to stop it.

09:44.158 --> 09:45.920
Ok. Heres the plan.

09:46.573 --> 09:50.108
Indigo is right across
the street from here. Ok?

09:50.737 --> 09:51.956
- The hair salon.
- Yes.

09:52.329 --> 09:55.625
And I'm gonna go over there and see
if they can squeeze me in for a perm.

09:55.633 --> 09:59.387
But when I get back,
this rabbits going down.

09:59.688 --> 10:03.238
- Yeah, thanks Shake. Thanks a lot, buddy.
- Take care, I'll be back in an hour.

10:05.789 --> 10:07.378
- Meatwad!
- What? What's going on?

10:07.686 --> 10:09.759
- Hey, can I get my jambox?
- Maybe later.

10:09.765 --> 10:11.017
Maybe now...

10:14.112 --> 10:17.662
- I'm gonna go get my jambox!
- No, Meatwad! Not the jambox!

10:18.438 --> 10:20.481
Everybody likes dancing, Frylock!

10:20.682 --> 10:22.621
Doo-doo-dee-doo. Doo-doo-dee-doo.

10:22.633 --> 10:26.922
Good going, Meatwad. You've tamed him
with your greasy dance of joy.

10:27.087 --> 10:30.921
I leave for 45 minutes
and this is what happens?

10:31.336 --> 10:34.118
Frylock, burn the rabbit down.

10:34.214 --> 10:36.405
I don't think we need to do that.
He's just dancing.

10:36.478 --> 10:39.166
Do it Frylock, because I said so!

10:42.167 --> 10:43.557
- Whoa!
- Aaagh!

10:44.845 --> 10:48.138
- Sorry.
- Way to go. Way to go.

10:48.183 --> 10:50.532
- You ok?
- Does it look like I'm ok?

10:50.905 --> 10:53.524
Stand back and I shall destroy him!

10:54.066 --> 10:57.183
Shake... Power... Activate!

11:03.379 --> 11:07.962
Now come over here and
slip on it if you dare, rabbit.

11:10.085 --> 11:12.573
- Now set the trap, Frylock!
- Trap? What trap?

11:12.574 --> 11:14.011
- Go get a trap.
- I didn't bring no trap.

11:14.086 --> 11:14.896
- What trap you talking about?
- Come on!

11:14.943 --> 11:18.133
Let's go! Let's go! He's gonna kill us!

11:18.718 --> 11:22.476
Things is looking shady
for the Aqua Teens!

11:26.321 --> 11:30.095
I have called this meeting to say
that downtown is no longer safe.

11:32.574 --> 11:36.978
So in short, we need to pick some
new restaurants and night clubs.

11:37.445 --> 11:39.143
Get out of my freaking pool!

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
