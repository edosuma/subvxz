30:19.375 --> 30:21.374
Stan? What did you?

30:21.500 --> 30:24.541
If anyone asks,
you do not know where I am.

30:25.417 --> 30:27.791

30:28.000 --> 30:29.333

30:32.792 --> 30:35.374
Just the usual.
The pigs.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.291
They will pay you. Don't worry.

30:44.125 --> 30:45.541
Cat wants to see you.

33:59.375 --> 34:02.208
Don't lie to me.

34:13.500 --> 34:14.833
Hold it...hold it.

34:17.792 --> 34:18.748
Let him in.

34:32.833 --> 34:34.166
I came to talk.

34:37.083 --> 34:39.291
And it won't be a discussion.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.541
You're here.

34:47.375 --> 34:48.416
Speak.

34:59.125 --> 35:02.374
I don't know a Stan.
We don't sell tik.

35:03.375 --> 35:06.583
- One of my men was killed.
- I know nothing.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.541
Never seen that ugly mug.

35:14.542 --> 35:15.583
Nope.

35:17.667 --> 35:19.208
Never seen him.

35:36.084 --> 35:38.124
I hope you're telling me the truth.

37:24.292 --> 37:26.583
You don't know how to control your men?
Lets chat.

37:27.292 --> 37:30.624
This new Tik, "Cam", I said:
only the kids in the townships get it.

37:30.792 --> 37:33.291
This son of a bitch Stan
thought he could overtake me.

37:36.667 --> 37:39.249
Welcome to you.

37:39.417 --> 37:40.458
Hi Rasta.

37:51.625 --> 37:54.999
Stan , you can not
spend your life being afraid.

37:55.417 --> 37:57.499
You see my friend here?
Repeat it all.

37:57.667 --> 38:00.499
Everything you told me.
Everything!

38:03.084 --> 38:04.833
The cops on the beach

38:05.375 --> 38:06.583
what did they want?

38:08.709 --> 38:10.374
What? I can't hear you.

38:10.500 --> 38:11.833
They were looking for me.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.458
Because of the Cam?

38:15.459 --> 38:16.541
The girl.

38:17.709 --> 38:19.166
What girl?

38:21.542 --> 38:23.458
White girl. The daughter of the rugby coach.

38:24.125 --> 38:26.833
The botanical gardens girl?
You knew her?

38:27.334 --> 38:30.166
I had sold her Cam.
We slept together.

38:30.334 --> 38:31.999
And you killed her, asshole?

38:32.542 --> 38:35.499
- That night, she blew her lid.
- You'd taken Tik?

38:36.209 --> 38:38.083
Both of us...

38:39.125 --> 38:40.374
She had too much.

38:41.334 --> 38:42.791
She wanted to get high.

38:43.375 --> 38:44.916
And we started to kiss,

38:46.334 --> 38:47.874
but then it started to kick in.

38:48.584 --> 38:51.416
She scratched me.
And went real crazy!

38:51.542 --> 38:53.249
She crushed my balls.

38:53.875 --> 38:55.541
I freaked out.

39:07.042 --> 39:08.999
Who was that?

39:09.625 --> 39:10.708
The guy who pays you.

39:11.209 --> 39:12.749
Don't worry about it.

39:13.334 --> 39:14.666
We must clean the house from the beach.

39:15.500 --> 39:16.624
And this son of a bitch now?

39:18.042 --> 39:20.749
Keep it cool.
He can still serve us.

40:46.167 --> 40:47.499
Stop it.

40:48.250 --> 40:49.874
Stop it.

40:50.417 --> 40:53.249
Shut up!

41:31.042 --> 41:33.458
He got where it hurts!

41:34.709 --> 41:36.416
You'll never be a man,

41:36.542 --> 41:37.249
small Zulu!

41:37.875 --> 41:38.583
Let's hear you!

42:36.334 --> 42:37.541
There you are.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.249
Yes, good job. Thank you very much.

48:03.459 --> 48:05.083
Good morning.

48:21.875 --> 48:24.083
The kid that went in there...

48:27.625 --> 48:29.583
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

50:35.417 --> 50:37.499
- Did you tell the police?
- What?

50:37.667 --> 50:39.041
That the kids disappeared.

50:39.209 --> 50:40.499
We must tell them!

50:40.667 --> 50:44.999
Excuse me, but the police couldn't
care less about those street kids.

51:42.459 --> 51:44.791
Oh, that's my son, that's my...

51:50.542 --> 51:52.583
Not to search any township.

53:36.334 --> 53:38.999
- Have a good trip?
- Miserable.

53:39.167 --> 53:43.333
Five hours late. The airport
in Zurich was under the snow.

53:44.709 --> 53:47.791
But it was worth it.
They are very interested.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.041
- How?
- 40.

53:51.500 --> 53:52.541
To health.

53:54.375 --> 53:57.041
Once the trunks
are in Zurich...

53:57.209 --> 54:00.874
We must act quickly.
One of the cops found the house.

54:01.084 --> 54:02.624
You had everything cleaned?

54:02.792 --> 54:03.791
Ya.

54:04.500 --> 54:06.666
In 2 or 3 days, everything will be finished.

54:07.500 --> 54:11.624
In the meantime, we will throw the cops
a bone.

55:35.084 --> 55:36.416
Don't leave it to chance.

01:00:00.625 --> 01:00:02.208
You can not...

01:00:02.375 --> 01:00:03.083
Shut up!

01:00:10.125 --> 01:00:11.874
I read what Stan
did to your friend.

01:00:12.084 --> 01:00:14.083
Don't tell me you know how to read.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:16.666
I have daughters
who taught me.

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:09.249
We leave tonight.

01:10:10.209 --> 01:10:12.833
I need you clean everything.

01:10:15.042 --> 01:10:17.749
And don't forget
about the pigs.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.291
Do not worry,
I am a true Zulu.

01:11:40.417 --> 01:11:41.541
I know.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.249
Where?

01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:06.874
Do not forget that I, too,
I am Zulu.

01:12:07.084 --> 01:12:08.708
As much as you !

01:12:08.875 --> 01:12:10.124
I know.

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:11.416
I know.

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.708
Hello. What are you doing here,
old woman?

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:33.999
Have you seen?

01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:41.999
And you?

01:20:53.542 --> 01:20:56.458
You are not a nigga that will scare me.

01:32:52.834 --> 01:32:54.249
Coward.

01:32:54.625 --> 01:32:55.874
Let go!

01:34:07.334 --> 01:34:10.249
Motherfucker, this isn't another white man.
This is the devil in person.
