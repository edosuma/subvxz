WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:04.171
TONIGHT ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,</i>

00:04.171 --> 00:06.006
CHEF RAMSAY HEADS
TO REDONDO BEACH, CALIFORNIA.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.674
BUT THE SUN ISN'T SHINING

00:07.674 --> 00:09.301
ON THIS MEDITERRANEAN
FAMILY RESTAURANT.

00:09.301 --> 00:10.594
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!

00:10.594 --> 00:12.095
THERE'S A STORM BREWING

00:12.095 --> 00:14.181
BETWEEN TWO OWNERS WHO HAPPEN
TO BE AN AUNT AND A NIECE.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.057
I NEED HELP.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.099
WHAT?

00:16.099 --> 00:17.392
AUNT FAY COMPLAINS

00:17.392 --> 00:18.977
THAT SHE IS THE ONLY ONE
PUTTING IN ANY EFFORT.

00:18.977 --> 00:19.978
SO WHO'S NOT PULLING
THEIR WEIGHT?

00:19.978 --> 00:21.855
NONE OF THEM.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.858
BUT THEN AGAIN, SHE REFUSES
TO TAKE HELP FROM ANYONE.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.735
YOU DON'T LET ANYBODY
HELP YOU.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.070
NO, THEY DON'T WANT TO.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.905
NIECE BRENDA COMPLAINS

00:29.905 --> 00:30.000
THAT FAY DOESN'T TREAT HER
AS HER PARTNER.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.448
THAT FAY DOESN'T TREAT HER
AS HER PARTNER.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.866
YOU'VE NOT BEEN SHOWN
THE RECIPES?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.159
NO.
THIS IS CRAZY.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.536
BUT HER LACK OF PASSION...

00:35.536 --> 00:37.538
I'M GONNA GO SIT DOWN
IN MY BOOTH.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.498
HAS EVERYONE FEELING
THAT SHE DOESN'T CARE.

00:39.498 --> 00:42.459
WHEN YOU JUST SIT ON YOUR PHONE,
WE'RE COOKING, SERVING.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.169
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.837
IT'S HARD FOR CHEF RAMSAY
TO TELL WHO'S RIGHT...

00:45.837 --> 00:47.214
IT IS BEDLAM.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.465
AND WHO'S WRONG.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.592
THERE'S POOR COMMUNICATION.
I CAN SEE THAT.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.010
BUT ONE THING'S FOR SURE.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.096
CAN YOU BE ABLE TO DO THINGS
WHEN I'M NOT HERE?

00:54.096 --> 00:55.931
I DO!

00:55.931 --> 00:57.057
THEY ARE MORE FOCUSED
ON EACH OTHER'S FAULTS...

00:57.057 --> 00:58.267
NOBODY WANTS TO HELP HER

00:58.267 --> 01:00.000
BECAUSE SHE IS SO CRITICAL
OF THE WAY YOU DO HELP HER.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.728
BECAUSE SHE IS SO CRITICAL
OF THE WAY YOU DO HELP HER.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.272
THAN RUNNING THE RESTAURANT.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.399
I'LL FIX IT.
FIX WHAT? IT'S CORRECT.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.775
IT'S NOT CORRECT.

01:06.775 --> 01:07.901
AS FOR THE STAFF...

01:07.901 --> 01:09.111
NOW I NEED TO MAKE
FLAMING POTATOES.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.904
MOVE THAT.
CAN YOU--I--

01:10.904 --> 01:12.114
THEY ARE NOT ONLY FIGHTING
WITH EACH OTHER...

01:12.114 --> 01:14.032
ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?

01:14.032 --> 01:15.325
THEY'RE READY TO WALK
OUT THE DOOR.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.577
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME, MAN.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.704
WALK OUT LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.330
TONIGHT, CHEF RAMSAY IS IN

01:20.330 --> 01:21.498
FOR THE CHALLENGE
OF THE YEAR...

01:21.498 --> 01:24.001
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS SO WRONG.
NO.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.627
AS HE ATTEMPTS TO TURN AROUND
A RESTAURANT...

01:25.627 --> 01:26.837
THAT'S GROSS.

01:26.837 --> 01:27.838
IN UTTER TURMOIL.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.000
YOU'RE SCREWED.
I'M DONE.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.674
YOU'RE SCREWED.
I'M DONE.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.553
WHAT IS THAT?

01:34.553 --> 01:36.263
YOU'RE SERVING ROTTEN FOOD.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.472
THEY'RE NOT CRAP.
THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.099
THEN WAKE UP!
YOU WAKE UP!

01:40.058 --> 01:41.184
SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.436
GET OUT OF HERE!

01:42.436 --> 01:43.812
THAT IS AMAZING.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.022
THAT'S EMBARRASSING!

01:45.022 --> 01:46.148
OH, GOD!

01:46.148 --> 01:47.482
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.073
REDONDO BEACH, CALIFORNIA.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.160
JUST BLOCKS FROM THE OCEAN
IS ZAYNA FLAMING GRILL,

01:58.160 --> 02:00.000
OPENED IN 2009
BY THE AUNT-AND-NIECE TEAM

02:00.000 --> 02:01.830
OPENED IN 2009
BY THE AUNT-AND-NIECE TEAM

02:01.830 --> 02:03.498
FAY AND BRENDA.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.667
MAMA'S FALAFEL
FOR TABLE FIVE.

02:05.667 --> 02:09.546
I'M EGYPTIAN.
I CAME TO UNITED STATES AT 18.

02:09.546 --> 02:14.051
MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WAS
A CATERING TRUCK FOR 16 YEARS.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.178
AND IT WAS REALLY SUCCESSFUL.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.472
BUT I ALWAYS WANTED
TO BUY MY OWN RESTAURANT.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.516
IT WAS ALWAYS MY DREAM
TO HAVE MY OWN BUSINESS.

02:21.516 --> 02:25.062
AND WHEN THE DOOR OPENED ABOUT
OPENING A RESTAURANT WITH FAY,

02:25.062 --> 02:26.980
I DECIDED TO GIVE HER A CALL

02:26.980 --> 02:30.000
SINCE SHE HAD KITCHEN EXPERIENCE
AND I HAD MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.444
SINCE SHE HAD KITCHEN EXPERIENCE
AND I HAD MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE.

02:32.444 --> 02:35.989
WHEN I PUT THE MEAT SOMEWHERE
ON THE GRILL, DO NOT MOVE IT.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.157
I JUST CHECKED THEM.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.034
IT'S DONE!

02:39.034 --> 02:40.160
THE REASON WHY THIS PLACE
IS GOING DOWNHILL

02:40.160 --> 02:42.162
IS BECAUSE OF THE DRAMA
BETWEEN FAY AND BRENDA.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.872
ACTUALLY,
ALL THIS WAS ON THIS SIDE.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.082
<i>THESE WERE ON THIS SIDE.</i>

02:45.082 --> 02:46.583
NO, THIS WAS HERE.
THEY'RE NOT COOKING.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.001
FAMILIES DON'T WANT
TO COME HERE,

02:48.001 --> 02:49.378
BECAUSE WHY WOULD YOU WANT

02:49.378 --> 02:51.338
TO COME TO A RESTAURANT
WITH ARGUING AND STRESS?

02:51.338 --> 02:52.506
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.591
OH, MY GOD!

02:54.591 --> 02:56.301
FAY IS DEFINITELY
THE SCARY BOSS HERE.

02:56.301 --> 03:00.000
SHE'S THE ONE WHO PUSHES PEOPLE,
SCREAMS AT PEOPLE.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.222
SHE'S THE ONE WHO PUSHES PEOPLE,
SCREAMS AT PEOPLE.

03:00.222 --> 03:03.225
YOU GUYS NEED TO TAKE THE MEAT
WHEN THE ORDER COMES OUT.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.602
SHE'LL TELL THE STAFF,
"SHUT UP."

03:05.602 --> 03:06.687
BE QUIET.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.771
"GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN."

03:07.771 --> 03:09.815
THEN MOVE!
MOVE FROM HERE.

03:09.815 --> 03:10.816
"STOP ARGUING WITH ME."

03:10.816 --> 03:11.858
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!

03:11.858 --> 03:12.859
"ZIP IT."

03:12.859 --> 03:14.111
MOVE, MOVE.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.987
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW!

03:15.987 --> 03:17.197
DO NOT MOVE THE TICKETS.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.949
FAY NEEDS HELP,

03:18.949 --> 03:20.617
BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO ACCEPT IT FROM ANYBODY.

03:20.617 --> 03:24.121
I KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.997
FAY DOESN'T TRUST ME
TO RUN THIS PLACE.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.332
THE SALAD IS NOT--

03:27.332 --> 03:29.126
DO YOU SEE ME STANDING HERE,
DOING NOTHING?

03:29.126 --> 03:30.000
SHE SEES ME AS HER NIECE
AND NOT HER PARTNER.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.128
SHE SEES ME AS HER NIECE
AND NOT HER PARTNER.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.129
IT'S A COMPLETE JOKE.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.381
I'M OBVIOUSLY DOING STUFF.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.842
BRENDA DOESN'T SEEM
TO CARE ANYMORE.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.760
I'M GONNA GO SIT DOWN
IN MY BOOTH.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.096
<i>I JUST WANT TO SLEEP.</i>

03:41.096 --> 03:42.180
SHE'LL BE ON THE PHONE.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.181
HOW ARE YOU?

03:43.181 --> 03:44.182
TALKS TO FRIEND.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.017
WHERE IS BRENDA?

03:46.017 --> 03:49.020
RIGHT NOW IT'S
BRENDA'S JUST LAZINESS.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.814
I WANT YOU
TO BE STRONGER PERSON,

03:50.814 --> 03:52.399
BUT THAT'S YOUR PERSONALITY.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.775
IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT--
<i>I WANT YOU TO BE STRONG.</i>

03:53.775 --> 03:54.985
JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT YELLING
AT THEM--

03:54.985 --> 03:58.071
IT'S NOT YELLING.
I'M NOT WANTING YOU TO YELL.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.072
YOU KNOW WHAT, FAY?

04:01.116 --> 04:03.285
I'LL FIX IT.
FIX WHAT? IT'S CORRECT.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.536
IT'S NOT CORRECT.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.246
ALL THEIR PROBLEMS COME
FROM THE RESTAURANT.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.123
YOU'VE BECOME, LIKE,
SO FRUSTRATED.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.291
YOU'RE LIKE,
"TO HELL WITH IT.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.293
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE."
IT'S SO UPSETTING.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.670
THIS RESTAURANT HAS PUT A STRAIN
ON MY ENTIRE FAMILY.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.923
I REALLY HAVE TO GO.
I'M DONE.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.342
NOBODY UNDERSTANDS
HOW MUCH STRESS I'M UNDER.

04:19.342 --> 04:23.096
I'VE BORROWED FROM MY PARENTS
A LITTLE OVER 60 GRAND.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.514
IF THE RESTAURANT FAILS,

04:24.514 --> 04:26.558
I FEEL LIKE
I WOULD'VE FAILED MY FAMILY.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.351
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE REALLY NEED HELP.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.000
IF I DON'T SMILE,
I'M GONNA EXPLODE.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.645
IF I DON'T SMILE,
I'M GONNA EXPLODE.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.063
I'M GONNA CRY.

04:32.063 --> 04:36.777
THE RESTAURANT IS MY LIFE.
BUT IT BECAME A BURDEN.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.987
IT SEEMS LIKE
IT'S SLIPPING AWAY.

04:38.987 --> 04:44.910
AND I FEEL LIKE IF THIS IS GONE,
I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT.

04:44.910 --> 04:49.247
IT SHOULD NEVER BE
LIKE THIS.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.964
BOTH FAY AND BRENDA
HAVE REQUESTED MEETINGS

04:57.964 --> 04:59.299
WITH CHEF RAMSAY

04:59.299 --> 05:00.000
PRIOR TO HIM ARRIVING
AT THE RESTAURANT.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.218
PRIOR TO HIM ARRIVING
AT THE RESTAURANT.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.844
HOW ARE YOU?
BRENDA, RIGHT?
YES.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.180
HE REALIZES THAT THIS IS
A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

05:05.180 --> 05:07.098
TO GET BOTH SIDES
OF THE STORY.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.642
<i>IT'S FAY, RIGHT?</i>

05:08.642 --> 05:10.018
HELLO.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.186
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
LIKEWISE.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.312
GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.147
IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.565
WELL, IT'S A PLEASURE
SEEING YOU.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.150
OH, THANK YOU.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.194
AND OBVIOUSLY, I WANTED
TO REACH OUT AND HAVE A WORD

05:19.194 --> 05:21.112
BEFORE I WENT INSIDE
OF THE RESTAURANT.
YES.

05:21.112 --> 05:25.116
I WANT TO TELL YOU
SOME ISSUES THAT I HAVE

05:25.116 --> 05:27.077
WITH MY BUSINESS PARTNER
AND MY NIECE BRENDA.
OKAY, GREAT.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.830
TELL ME ABOUT THE RESTAURANT.
HOW DID IT START?

05:29.830 --> 05:30.000
FAY HAD THIS IDEA AND SAW
A LOCATION THAT SHE REALLY LIKED

05:30.000 --> 05:32.874
FAY HAD THIS IDEA AND SAW
A LOCATION THAT SHE REALLY LIKED

05:32.874 --> 05:35.168
<i>AND APPROACHED MY MOM.</i>

05:35.168 --> 05:36.419
AND SHE SAID THAT I WOULD
POSSIBLY BE INTERESTED.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.463
<i>IT KIND OF JUST TOOK OFF</i>
<i>FROM THERE, YOU KNOW,</i>

05:38.463 --> 05:40.841
AND IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.592
AND ARE YOU 50-50?

05:42.592 --> 05:44.177
YES, WE'RE 50-50 PARTNERS.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.262
RIGHT.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.013
SO EXPLAIN THE ROLES
OF THE RESTAURANT.

05:47.013 --> 05:50.934
I SHOP. I COOK.
I CLEAN.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.435
OH, YOU'RE THE CHEF AS WELL?
YES.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.979
WOW. YOU'RE BUSY.

05:53.979 --> 05:57.357
SO IF YOU COOK, SHOP, CLEAN,
WHAT THE HELL DOES BRENDA DO?

05:57.357 --> 06:00.000
UH...

06:00.000 --> 06:02.112
UH...

06:02.112 --> 06:04.906
BASICALLY, THERE'S DIFFERENT
DAYS WHERE I AM SERVING,

06:04.906 --> 06:07.117
AND THERE'S DAYS
WHERE I'M ON THE LINE WITH FAY.

06:07.117 --> 06:11.204
RIGHT.
AND IT CAN GET A LITTLE
OVERBEARING BACK THERE,

06:11.204 --> 06:13.456
'CAUSE FAY, SHE'S DEFINITELY
A CONTROL FREAK.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.042
SHE DOESN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE
IN ME STEPPING INTO THE KITCHEN

06:16.042 --> 06:17.627
AND BEING ABLE
TO HELP HER OUT.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.713
AND SHE IS JUST LIKE,
"NO, YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT."

06:19.713 --> 06:22.632
AND I SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE
I'M AN EMPLOYEE, NOT AN EQUAL.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.389
EVERY--LITERALLY EVERYTHING.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.000
WHY CAN'T BRENDA PREP
FOR HER ONE DAY

06:30.000 --> 06:31.558
WHY CAN'T BRENDA PREP
FOR HER ONE DAY

06:31.558 --> 06:33.602
RUNNING THE BUSINESS
INDEPENDENTLY?

06:33.602 --> 06:35.604
UM, SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

06:35.604 --> 06:39.274
SHE STAY OUT WITH FRIENDS,
AND SHE'S VERY TIRED.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.692
THE KIDS, THEY TELL ME
WHEN I'M NOT THERE,

06:40.692 --> 06:43.236
WE SIT ON THE COMPUTER,
WATCH TV, OR WATCH--

06:43.236 --> 06:45.155
WHAT?

06:45.155 --> 06:47.240
HOW DOES THE BUSINESS RUN
ON THOSE NIGHTS

06:47.240 --> 06:48.575
WHEN YOUR AUNTIE'S
NOT THERE?

06:48.575 --> 06:49.826
VERY SMOOTHLY.
UH-HUH.

06:49.826 --> 06:50.994
AND CUSTOMERS ARE HAPPY
WITH THE FOOD?

06:50.994 --> 06:53.496
DEFINITELY.
THINGS FLOW EASY.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.165
I FEEL LIKE
IT'S A DISASTER.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.791
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THIS IS A DISASTER?

06:56.791 --> 06:58.376
THE CUSTOMER COME TO ME
AND TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.461
WOW.

06:59.461 --> 07:00.000
BRENDA'S COOKING
IN YOUR ABSENCE--

07:00.000 --> 07:01.171
BRENDA'S COOKING
IN YOUR ABSENCE--

07:01.171 --> 07:02.547
HOW WOULD YOU GIVE THAT,
OUT OF TEN?

07:02.547 --> 07:04.591
SIX.
SIX.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.925
I GIVE MYSELF TEN.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.093
OH, WOW.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.596
IF SHE WASN'T YOUR NIECE,
WOULD YOU FIRE HER?

07:09.596 --> 07:12.057
YES.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.768
IF THIS WASN'T YOUR AUNTIE,
WOULD YOU FIRE HER?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.102
YES.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.854
HOW LONG CAN
THE BUSINESS CONTINUE?

07:17.854 --> 07:19.564
I'M GIVING MYSELF
ABOUT A YEAR.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.274
REALLY? WOW.
<i>YES.</i>

07:21.274 --> 07:23.109
OUR NUMBERS ARE HORRIBLE.
OH, I SEE.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.486
HOW MUCH DID YOU PUT
INTO THE BUSINESS?

07:24.486 --> 07:27.447
WE PUT ABOUT 60 GRAND EACH.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.782
WOW.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.000
I'M AFRAID AND SCARED
THAT I WILL LOSE THIS.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.451
I'M AFRAID AND SCARED
THAT I WILL LOSE THIS.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.703
IN THIS TIME OF MY LIFE,

07:33.703 --> 07:38.958
I DON'T SEE MYSELF GOING TO WORK
FOR SOMEONE AND EVEN RETIRE.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.378
I REALLY NEED CHEF RAMSAY
TO CHANGE BRENDA.

07:41.378 --> 07:44.756
BUT I HAVE DOUBT
THAT ANYTHING WILL CHANGE.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.341
BRENDA'S NOT GONNA CHANGE.

07:46.341 --> 07:48.510
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU BACK
AT THE RESTAURANT, OKAY?

07:48.510 --> 07:50.011
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, DARLING.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.263
I'LL SEE YOU BACK THERE.
I APPRECIATE YOU.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.851
AFTER HEARING
TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORIES

07:56.851 --> 07:58.937
FROM THE OWNERS
ABOUT WHY ZAYNA IS FAILING,

07:58.937 --> 08:00.000
CHEF RAMSAY ARRIVES
AT THE RESTAURANT,

08:00.000 --> 08:00.980
CHEF RAMSAY ARRIVES
AT THE RESTAURANT,

08:00.980 --> 08:03.066
ANXIOUS TO SEE
WHERE THE PROBLEMS LIE.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.527
SO "FRESH, FLAVORFUL FOOD
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK."

08:05.527 --> 08:06.986
NOW, THAT IS FRESH.

08:06.986 --> 08:07.987
HELLO.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.489
HELLO.
HI, MY NAME'S AMEL.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.990
AMEL, NICE TO SEE YOU.
AND THIS IS?

08:10.990 --> 08:12.534
MARK.
OKAY.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.119
HE'S MY SON.
WHAT DO YOU DO?

08:14.119 --> 08:15.078
HELP AROUND WITH EVERYTHING,

08:15.078 --> 08:17.247
FROM COOKING TO BUSSING,
SERVING, SEATING.

08:17.247 --> 08:20.083
OKAY. RIGHT.
WELL, GOOD TO MEET YOU.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.584
<i>LET ME SIT DOWN</i>
<i>AND HAVE A QUICK BITE TO EAT,</i>

08:21.584 --> 08:23.128
GET UP TO SPEED,
AND I'LL CATCH UP AFTER.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.838
THANK YOU.
ENJOY.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.381
OH, BOY.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.382
<i>IF YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE A SEAT</i>
<i>ON THE COUCH.</i>

08:27.382 --> 08:28.550
<i>EXCELLENT.</i>

08:28.550 --> 08:30.000
OOH! SINKING DOWN HERE.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.010
OOH! SINKING DOWN HERE.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.596
I FEEL LIKE I'M BACK
AT MY GRANDMA'S COUCH.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.848
WHY HAVE YOU GOT
SUCH HIGH COUCHES

08:34.848 --> 08:35.974
IN SUCH A SMALL RESTAURANT?

08:35.974 --> 08:38.518
I'M NOT QUITE SURE.
I...

08:38.518 --> 08:40.145
WOW, OKAY.
NOW HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

08:40.145 --> 08:41.521
I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR 4 1/2 YEARS.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.897
SO YOU'VE BEEN HERE
SINCE THE BEGINNING?

08:42.897 --> 08:44.524
YES.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.067
<i>THE TWO OWNERS, DO THEY RUN</i>
<i>THE BUSINESS TOGETHER?</i>

08:46.067 --> 08:47.152
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

08:47.152 --> 08:49.988
FAYZA WORKS HERE MORE DAYS
THAN BRENDA DOES.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.906
OH, REALLY?
YEAH.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.324
AREN'T THEY 50-50 PARTNERS?

08:53.324 --> 08:54.701
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE 50-50.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.413
BUT I WOULD SAY IT WOULD
PROBABLY BE A 75-25 DIFFERENCE.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.998
OH, WOW.

08:59.998 --> 09:00.000
<i>FAYZA'S DEFINITELY</i>
<i>THE 75% OF WORK.</i>

09:00.000 --> 09:02.917
<i>FAYZA'S DEFINITELY</i>
<i>THE 75% OF WORK.</i>

09:02.917 --> 09:04.085
AND WHAT DOES
THE OTHER PARTNER DO?

09:04.085 --> 09:05.545
BRENDA'S MORE LAID-BACK.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.048
SHE PREFERS MORE TALKING
TO THE CUSTOMERS

09:08.048 --> 09:09.090
INSTEAD OF BEING IN THE BACK
WITH THE KITCHEN.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.091
OH.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.259
<i>SO WHO'S THE BOSS?</i>

09:11.259 --> 09:12.802
THE SCARY BOSS WOULD BE FAYZA.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.095
FAYZA?

09:14.095 --> 09:15.430
IS IT FAY OR FAYZA?

09:15.430 --> 09:16.639
SHE SAID TO ME
HER NAME WAS FAY, SO...

09:16.639 --> 09:18.892
USUALLY, I CALL HER FAYZA.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.685
OR SOMETIMES WHEN IT'S BUSY,
I'LL CALL HER FAY.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.187
<i>THERE'S PEOPLE</i>
<i>WHO CALL HER FOO-FOO.</i>

09:22.187 --> 09:23.730
FOO-FOO.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.982
I'LL STICK TO FAY.
IS SHE SCARY?

09:25.982 --> 09:27.150
SHE IS HELL ON WHEELS.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.568
WOW.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.000
IF IT GETS BUSY,
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS,

09:30.000 --> 09:30.612
IF IT GETS BUSY,
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS,

09:30.612 --> 09:32.072
YOU WILL HEAR YELLING
IN THE DINING ROOM.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.908
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS
BACK THERE, OUR CUSTOMERS SEE.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.034
OUR CUSTOMERS
HEAR EVERYTHING.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.203
<i>WOW. SERIOUSLY?</i>
YEAH.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.829
FAY HAS
AN EXTREMELY SHORT TEMPER.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.874
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG,
ALL HELL WILL BREAK LOOSE.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.417
<i>HOW DO YOU GET ON WITH MARK?</i>

09:44.417 --> 09:46.503
IT MUST BE HARD WHEN YOU'RE
WORKING WITH THE OWNER'S SON.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.629
<i>YES.</i>

09:47.629 --> 09:49.714
IF HE SEES
SOMETHING THAT'S DIRTY,

09:49.714 --> 09:51.841
<i>HE WILL LEAVE IT FOR</i>
<i>SOMEBODY ELSE TO TAKE CARE OF.</i>

09:51.841 --> 09:52.842
IS HE LAZY?

09:52.842 --> 09:55.595
WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING,

09:55.595 --> 09:56.971
HE DOESN'T DO IT
FULL-HEARTEDLY,

09:56.971 --> 09:59.099
IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.000
SO HE LEAVES A MESS FOR YOU
WHEN YOU COME IN THE NEXT DAY?

10:00.000 --> 10:00.100
SO HE LEAVES A MESS FOR YOU
WHEN YOU COME IN THE NEXT DAY?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.601
YEAH.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.186
<i>OH, WOW, WELL, THANK YOU</i>
<i>FOR THE INSIGHT.</i>

10:03.186 --> 10:06.147
I'M GONNA LOOK AT EVERYTHING
AND--WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.315
"MEDITERRANEAN BISTRO.

10:07.315 --> 10:11.027
AN EXQUISITE 'DINNING'
ADVENTURE."

10:11.027 --> 10:12.403
OH.
WOW.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.613
WHERE'S MARK?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.115
MARK?
OH, MARK, HE IS--

10:15.115 --> 10:16.116
COULD YOU ASK HIM
TO COME AROUND?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.534
YEAH.
<i>THANK YOU.</i>

10:17.534 --> 10:18.993
<i>HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.</i>

10:18.993 --> 10:20.411
YES, SIR.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.996
AMEL, COME WITH HIM.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.123
<i>I GOT A LITTLE QUIZ.</i>

10:23.123 --> 10:25.416
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

10:25.416 --> 10:28.002
HOW DO YOU SPELL "BISTRO"?

10:28.002 --> 10:29.337
HOW DO YOU SPELL...

10:29.337 --> 10:30.000
BISTRO.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.922
BISTRO.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.382
B-I-S-T-R-O.

10:32.382 --> 10:33.925
UH-HUH.
GOOD.

10:33.925 --> 10:36.469
AND HOW DO YOU SPELL "DINING"?

10:39.973 --> 10:43.351
D-I-N-N-I-N-G.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.271
SO YOU WROTE THIS MENU?

10:49.023 --> 10:51.359
"DINING" IS D-I-N-I-N-G.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.735
<i>OKAY.</i>

10:52.735 --> 10:54.571
HAS ANYBODY ELSE
MENTIONED IT?

10:54.571 --> 10:57.240
WE HAVE A LOT OF CUSTOMERS
WHO HAVE POINTED IT OUT TO US.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.951
RIGHT.
UM, THANK YOU, MARK.

10:59.951 --> 11:00.000
OKAY, AMEL,
WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.452
OKAY, AMEL,
WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND?

11:01.452 --> 11:04.080
WE DO FOUR DIFFERENT DIPS.
WE'LL DO HUMMUS, BABA GHANOUSH--

11:04.080 --> 11:05.290
<i>GIVE ME</i>
<i>THE FOUR DIFFERENT DIPS.</i>

11:05.290 --> 11:07.208
WE'LL GO FOR THAT, YEAH.
<i>OKAY.</i>

11:07.208 --> 11:09.961
LET'S GO FOR THE FAVA BEANS,
THE KIBBI ROLL.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.254
OKAY.
<i>YEAH.</i>

11:11.254 --> 11:13.089
AND THEN LET'S GO
FOR THE ZAYNA COMBO PLATE.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.090
ALL RIGHT.
<i>DEFINITELY.</i>

11:14.090 --> 11:15.592
THANK YOU, MY DARLING.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.135
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.
I'LL PLACE YOUR ORDER RIGHT NOW.

11:17.135 --> 11:20.096
FIRST IMPRESSIONS?
THE PLACE IS SOULLESS.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.182
MAN.
OOH!

11:25.185 --> 11:26.227
IT'S LIKE DOMINOES.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.689
THEY JUST KEEP ON COMING DOWN.
WHY IS THAT?

11:29.689 --> 11:30.000
HONESTLY.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.941
HONESTLY.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.109
WHY?

11:33.109 --> 11:34.986
OH,.

11:34.986 --> 11:37.197
MAN.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.573
<i>WOW.</i>
ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?

11:38.573 --> 11:41.159
THREE KIBBI, FAVA BEANS,
AND ZAYNA COMBO.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.953
OKAY.
LET'S ROCK AND ROLL.

11:43.953 --> 11:47.165
I AM VERY PROUD OF MY FOOD,
AND I STAND BY IT.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.667
IT'S FRESH,
IT'S MADE TO ORDER.

11:49.667 --> 11:53.004
CHEF RAMSAY--THERE'S NO WAY
HE WOULD DISLIKE MY FOOD.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.340
<i>THE APPETIZER IS READY.</i>
<i>JUST TAKE IT OUT.</i>

11:55.340 --> 11:57.550
<i>I'M CONFIDENT.</i>

11:57.550 --> 12:00.000
OUR FOOD'S GOOD.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.094
OUR FOOD'S GOOD.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.262
DAMN.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.097
COMING UP, CHEF RAMSAY DIGS IN.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.849
LOOKS LIKE
THE INSIDE OF A DIAPER.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.018
AND THINGS GO
FROM BAD TO WORSE...

12:07.018 --> 12:08.061
SO WHO'S NOT PULLING
THEIR WEIGHT?

12:08.061 --> 12:09.896
NONE OF THEM.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.147
AS THE STAFF IS READY
TO JUMP SHIP.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.024
GO AHEAD, WALK OUT
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.360
AND LATER...

12:15.360 --> 12:16.861
UGH. GROSS.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.321
CHEF RAMSAY IS SO FRUSTRATED...

12:18.321 --> 12:19.697
<i>MY GOD.</i>

12:19.697 --> 12:20.740
THAT HE RESORTS
TO DOING SOMETHING

12:20.740 --> 12:21.991
HE HAS NEVER DONE BEFORE.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.702
"FRESH FOOD SEVEN DAYS A WEEK,"
MY ASS.

12:31.416 --> 12:33.001
WHILE THE OWNERS CONTINUE
TO BLAME EACH OTHER

12:33.001 --> 12:34.836
FOR THE RESTAURANT'S PROBLEMS...

12:34.836 --> 12:36.880
THE APPETIZER IS READY.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.799
CHEF RAMSAY IS ANXIOUS
TO TASTE THE FOOD.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.803
SO THIS IS
OUR COMBINATION APPETIZER.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.055
OKAY. WOW.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.974
WHY IS ALL THAT OIL
ON THERE?

12:46.974 --> 12:49.351
WE USUALLY DRIZZLE THE TOP OF
OUR APPETIZERS WITH OLIVE OIL.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.519
DRIZZLE... OR FLOOD?

12:50.519 --> 12:51.895
UM, USUALLY, WE DRIZZLE.

12:51.895 --> 12:53.939
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S A LITTLE EXTRA PUT ON.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.315
YEAH, I'LL SAY.

12:55.315 --> 12:56.733
<i>COULD I HAVE A TEASPOON,</i>
<i>PLEASE, DARLING?</i>

12:56.733 --> 12:58.652
OF COURSE.
<i>THANK YOU.</i>

12:58.652 --> 12:58.873
WOW, YOU DRIZZLE SPARINGLY
WITH A TOUCH OF OIL.

12:58.873 --> 13:01.029
WOW, YOU DRIZZLE SPARINGLY
WITH A TOUCH OF OIL.

13:01.029 --> 13:02.781
<i>BUT LOOK AT IT.</i>

13:02.781 --> 13:04.074
I'VE GOT LITTLE SPOONFULS,

13:04.074 --> 13:06.785
LITTLE MINIATURE BATHTUBS FULL
OF OIL FLOATING ON THE SIDE.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.787
IT'S GROSS.

13:28.890 --> 13:29.808
HERE'S A TEASPOON.

13:29.808 --> 13:33.770
CAN YOU ASK MARK,
VERY CAREFULLY...

13:33.770 --> 13:35.772
TO STOP STARING AT ME?

13:35.772 --> 13:38.775
'CAUSE HE'S SCARY.
HE JUST STANDS THERE AND STARES.

13:38.775 --> 13:40.027
OKAY.
I'LL LET HIM--

13:40.027 --> 13:41.361
CAN I HAVE
ANOTHER LITTLE DISH FIRST

13:41.361 --> 13:43.822
TO PUT THIS OIL IN,
PLEASE, DARLING?
OH, YEAH.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.407
HEY, MARK,
HE SAYS STOP STARING AT HIM,

13:45.407 --> 13:46.700
'CAUSE YOU'RE
CREEPING HIM OUT.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.994
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME, MAN.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.621
A LITTLE DISH.

13:51.621 --> 13:52.914
UGH.

13:52.914 --> 13:55.167
A TEASPOON OF OIL.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.501
WHO PUT THE OIL ON?

13:56.501 --> 13:57.836
I'M NOT QUITE SURE.
I WASN'T BACK THERE.

13:57.836 --> 13:58.873
WOW.
THIS IS THE HUMMUS?

13:58.873 --> 14:00.589
WOW.
THIS IS THE HUMMUS?

14:00.589 --> 14:02.049
MY GOD.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.259
IT'S SO THIN.
IT'S JUST LIQUID.

14:04.259 --> 14:05.886
IS THAT NORMALLY THAT RUNNY,
THAT? THE HUMMUS?

14:05.886 --> 14:07.804
I'VE BEEN TOLD IT DEPENDS
ON THE GARBANZO BEANS.

14:07.804 --> 14:08.930
REALLY? WE'RE GONNA START
BLAMING A  BEAN

14:08.930 --> 14:10.474
FOR THE HUMMUS?

14:10.474 --> 14:12.559
THERE'S TIMES WHERE THE HUMMUS
WILL BE EXTREMELY THIN,

14:12.559 --> 14:14.603
OR THERE'S TIMES WHERE
THE HUMMUS WILL BE OVERLY THICK.

14:14.603 --> 14:15.812
YEAH,
IT'S NOT THE BEAN'S FAULT.

14:15.812 --> 14:17.731
IT'S THE CHEF'S.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.941
I FEEL LIKE I'M ALWAYS
APOLOGIZING FOR THE FOOD.

14:19.941 --> 14:21.234
ANYWAY, DARLING,
I'M DONE WITH THAT.

14:21.234 --> 14:22.569
OKAY.

14:22.569 --> 14:24.946
BUT I'M NOT A CHEF.
IT'S OUT OF MY CONTROL.

14:24.946 --> 14:27.157
WHO PUT THE OIL ON TOP
OF THE APPETIZER?

14:27.157 --> 14:28.742
I DIDN'T DO
THE APPETIZER.

14:28.742 --> 14:28.873
I DID IT.

14:28.873 --> 14:30.035
I DID IT.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.870
HE SAID IT'S A LOT OF OIL.

14:31.870 --> 14:34.831
IT'S TRADITION TO PUT
A GOOD AMOUNT OF OIL ON HUMMUS.

14:34.831 --> 14:37.793
SO FOR CHEF RAMSAY NOT
TO LIKE IT IS A SHOCKER TO ME.

14:37.793 --> 14:41.088
I SHOULD'VE MADE IT FOR HIM.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.761
THAT IS
A DISGUSTING BUSSING STATION.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.012
<i>IT LOOKS DREADFUL.</i>

14:49.012 --> 14:50.555
<i>THERE HAS TO BE</i>
<i>A MUCH BETTER PLACE</i>

14:50.555 --> 14:51.556
<i>TO PUT DIRTY DISHES</i>
<i>THAN THAT.</i>

14:51.556 --> 14:53.141
THAT'S BAD.

14:53.141 --> 14:54.601
<i>AMEL.</i>

14:54.601 --> 14:56.561
IT'S WEIRD HOW YOU JUST DROP
ALL THOSE DIRTIES THERE.

14:56.561 --> 14:57.729
<i>YEAH.</i>

14:57.729 --> 14:58.873
THAT'S WHERE OUR DISHES GO.

14:58.873 --> 14:58.897
THAT'S WHERE OUR DISHES GO.

14:58.897 --> 15:01.191
WHY NOT JUST WALK 5 FEET
AND PUT THE DIRTY PLATES

15:01.191 --> 15:02.818
<i>INSIDE THE PLATE WASH?</i>
I DON'T KNOW.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.320
HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO
WALK STRAIGHT INTO THE KITCHEN

15:05.320 --> 15:06.822
<i>AND PUT THEM IN THERE?</i>
NOT HARD AT ALL.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.073
CHEF RAMSAY IS RIGHT.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.533
BUT EVERY TIME
I TRY TO OPEN MY MOUTH,

15:09.533 --> 15:10.534
EVERY TIME
I HAVE A SUGGESTION,

15:10.534 --> 15:12.452
I BASICALLY GET TOLD
TO SHUT UP.

15:12.452 --> 15:13.829
THANK YOU, DARLING.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.705
YOU'RE WELCOME.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.168
FAVA BEANS IS READY.

15:20.168 --> 15:23.755
OKAY, I'M COMING TO GET IT.

15:23.755 --> 15:26.466
OH.
FAVA BEANS.

15:26.466 --> 15:28.135
AND WHO PUT THE ZED ON THERE?

15:28.135 --> 15:28.873
WHAT'S THE "Z"?

15:28.873 --> 15:29.136
WHAT'S THE "Z"?

15:29.136 --> 15:30.804
"Z" FOR ZAYNA,
KIND OF A DESIGN.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.597
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S
PUKED UP ON MY PLATE.

15:32.597 --> 15:33.849
OH, COME ON.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.600
DOES THAT LOOK APPETIZING
TO YOU?

15:35.600 --> 15:37.185
YEAH.

15:37.185 --> 15:38.478
IT DOESN'T LOOK
TOO APPETIZING?

15:38.478 --> 15:41.523
IT DOESN'T LOOK APPETIZING
AT ALL, NO.

15:41.523 --> 15:42.774
OKAY, THANK YOU.

15:42.774 --> 15:44.776
NO PROBLEM.

15:44.776 --> 15:46.945
UH...

15:46.945 --> 15:50.031
THAT LOOKS LIKE
THE INSIDE OF A DIAPER.

15:50.031 --> 15:52.826
I MEAN, IT'S SO BAD.

15:54.369 --> 15:56.705
HE SAID THE FAVA BEANS
LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE THREW UP.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.248
OKAY.

15:58.248 --> 15:58.873
TELL HIM,
"ENJOY YOUR MEAL."

15:58.873 --> 15:59.916
TELL HIM,
"ENJOY YOUR MEAL."

16:01.710 --> 16:04.087
I'M DONE THERE, DARLING.

16:04.087 --> 16:05.922
YEAH?
<i>ONE MOUTHFUL TOO MUCH.</i>

16:05.922 --> 16:07.174
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET THAT
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.426
THANK YOU, MY DARLING.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:09.426 --> 16:11.720
ONE THING I CAN CONFIRM,
IT TASTED THE WAY IT LOOKED--

16:11.720 --> 16:12.929
DREADFUL.

16:12.929 --> 16:14.973
NOPE.
NOT A WINNER.

16:14.973 --> 16:16.766
OKAY, WHATEVER.

16:16.766 --> 16:19.478
YOU GUYS,
THIS IS CRAZY.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.731
I DON'T AGREE WITH CHEF RAMSAY
ABOUT SOME OF THE ITEMS.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.357
THAT'S A FIRST.

16:24.357 --> 16:27.194
I WILL DEFEND MY FOOD
TO CHEF RAMSAY,

16:27.194 --> 16:28.873
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW HEALTHY
AND DELICIOUS IT IS.

16:28.873 --> 16:30.197
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW HEALTHY
AND DELICIOUS IT IS.

16:39.121 --> 16:41.290
CHEF RAMSAY HAS ONLY SAMPLED
A FEW DISHES

16:41.290 --> 16:43.083
BUT IS ALREADY
QUESTIONING THE FOOD.

16:43.083 --> 16:46.461
THAT LOOKS LIKE
THE INSIDE OF A DIAPER.

16:46.461 --> 16:49.131
AND OWNERS FAY AND BRENDA
ARE QUESTIONING THE FEEDBACK.

16:49.131 --> 16:50.090
FOOD NEVER COMES BACK.

16:50.090 --> 16:51.925
THAT'S A FIRST.

16:51.925 --> 16:53.885
PEOPLE ALWAYS RAVE
ABOUT OUR FOOD.

16:53.885 --> 16:55.262
WHATEVER.

16:55.262 --> 16:58.056
IF YOU'RE TELLING ME
MY FOOD'S NOT GOOD,

16:58.056 --> 17:01.059
I'D LOVE TO SEE
WHAT'S GOOD.

17:01.059 --> 17:03.312
WHO PUT THE KIBBI BACK?

17:03.312 --> 17:03.910
<i>I DID.</i>

17:03.910 --> 17:04.313
<i>I DID.</i>

17:04.313 --> 17:06.189
IT'S GONNA BE DRY.

17:06.189 --> 17:08.608
THAT'S WHY I MOVED
THE ONE THAT'S COOKED ALREADY.

17:08.608 --> 17:10.068
KIBBI ROLL, MARK.

17:11.403 --> 17:14.489
WHY NOT?

17:14.489 --> 17:18.076
<i>YOU SHOULD BE CONFIDENT</i>
<i>IN WHAT YOU DO.</i>

17:18.076 --> 17:19.077
<i>SO THESE ARE?</i>

17:19.077 --> 17:22.873
KIBBI ROLLS.

17:22.873 --> 17:24.750
<i>COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE DISH?</i>

17:24.750 --> 17:27.252
KIBBI ROLLS,
IT'S A BULGUR WHEAT SHELL

17:27.252 --> 17:29.338
WITH SIRLOIN GROUND BEEF
AND PINE NUTS IN THE MIDDLE.

17:29.338 --> 17:31.715
THANK YOU, MR. SUNSHINE.

17:31.715 --> 17:32.966
FRESH?

17:32.966 --> 17:33.910
UH, KIND OF.

17:33.910 --> 17:33.967
UH, KIND OF.

17:33.967 --> 17:35.177
WOW.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

17:35.177 --> 17:37.304
SHE'LL HAVE THEM, LIKE,
PREPPED FOR THE WEEK, LIKE,

17:37.304 --> 17:39.097
<i>ONE WEEK AHEAD, 'CAUSE IT TAKES</i>
<i>SO MUCH TIME PREPPING.</i>

17:39.097 --> 17:40.223
THEY TASTE--ARE THEY FROZEN?

17:40.223 --> 17:41.516
UH-HUH.
YEAH, THEY'RE FROZEN.

17:41.516 --> 17:42.851
<i>YEAH?</i>
YES, SIR.

17:42.851 --> 17:44.811
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT SAYS
ON THE FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT,

17:44.811 --> 17:46.229
<i>ON THE BANNERS OUTSIDE?</i>
ABOUT THE CATERING?

17:46.229 --> 17:47.981
NO. GO OUTSIDE,
HAVE A QUICK LOOK.

17:47.981 --> 17:49.107
OKAY.

17:49.107 --> 17:50.776
READ IT AND COME BACK IN.
YOU GOT IT.

17:50.776 --> 17:52.235
<i>WE'LL HAVE A CHAT.</i>

17:52.235 --> 17:53.820
DAMN.
I KNOW HE CAN'T SPELL.

17:53.820 --> 17:56.239
BUT LET'S HOPE
HE CAN  READ.

18:06.124 --> 18:07.250
WHAT'D IT SAY?

18:07.250 --> 18:09.711
WE CARE ABOUT QUALITY
AND TASTE.

18:09.711 --> 18:10.879
OKAY, GREAT.
WHAT ELSE DID IT SAY?

18:10.879 --> 18:12.381
<i>IT BEGAN WITH "F."</i>

18:12.381 --> 18:14.257
IT BEGAN WITH "F"?
I DIDN'T READ IT.

18:14.257 --> 18:15.425
I JUST READ "QUALITY AND TASTE,"
AND I WAS ASHAMED.
OH.

18:15.425 --> 18:16.885
THERE'S THREE "F"s THERE.

18:16.885 --> 18:18.220
<i>NOW READ IT PROPERLY</i>

18:18.220 --> 18:19.304
AND COME BACK
AND TELL ME WHAT IT SAYS.

18:19.304 --> 18:22.307
NO PROBLEM.

18:22.307 --> 18:24.226
HAVE A LOOK.

18:24.226 --> 18:26.395
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

18:29.648 --> 18:31.983
<i>OH, MAN.</i>

18:33.402 --> 18:33.910
ALL RIGHT.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.278
ALL RIGHT.

18:35.278 --> 18:37.114
RIGHT, THREE "F"s.

18:37.114 --> 18:39.700
THREE "F"s--
"FRESH, FLAVORFUL FOOD."

18:39.700 --> 18:41.118
RIGHT.

18:41.118 --> 18:43.203
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW
MY APPETIZER IS FROZEN,

18:43.203 --> 18:46.415
'CAUSE WE MAKE A BULK
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK.

18:46.415 --> 18:47.749
YEAH.

18:47.749 --> 18:50.377
I JUST READ THAT LITERALLY
ENTERING THE BUILDING,

18:50.377 --> 18:54.005
SO I DON'T EXPECT
ANYTHING FROZEN.

18:54.005 --> 18:55.882
THANK YOU.

18:57.426 --> 18:59.553
WOW.

18:59.553 --> 19:03.223
HE SAID, "YOUR SIGN OUTSIDE
SAYS 'FRESH, FLAVORFUL FOOD.'"

19:03.223 --> 19:03.910
I SAID, "YEAH."
"BUT THIS IS FROZEN."

19:03.910 --> 19:06.351
I SAID, "YEAH."
"BUT THIS IS FROZEN."

19:06.351 --> 19:07.978
HE KNEW BY THE TASTE.

19:07.978 --> 19:10.772
KIBBI,
YOU CANNOT DO IT FRESH.

19:10.772 --> 19:12.733
MAN.

19:12.733 --> 19:13.775
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

19:13.775 --> 19:15.610
I STAND BY THE KIBBI

19:15.610 --> 19:17.988
BECAUSE WE REALLY USE
GOOD INGREDIENTS.

19:17.988 --> 19:19.990
I DON'T SEE
IN ANY ARABIC HOME

19:19.990 --> 19:21.158
ANYONE CAN MAKE THEM
DIFFERENTLY.

19:21.158 --> 19:23.243
THE CHICKEN'S
ALMOST READY?

19:23.243 --> 19:24.995
<i>IT'S KIND OF NOT COOKING</i>
<i>ON THAT SIDE.</i>

19:24.995 --> 19:27.164
I DON'T WANT TO BURN IT.
IT'S NOT BURNING.

19:27.164 --> 19:29.040
I NEED TO MARK IT,
AND IT'S DONE.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.293
IF IT'S DONE,
IT NEEDS TO BE OFF THE GRILL...

19:31.293 --> 19:32.711
WELL, IT STILL NEEDS
TO GET MARKED.

19:32.711 --> 19:33.910
<i>OR IT WILL BE OVERDONE.</i>
IT'S NOT OVERDONE.

19:33.910 --> 19:34.171
<i>OR IT WILL BE OVERDONE.</i>
IT'S NOT OVERDONE.

19:34.171 --> 19:36.256
<i>IT IS.</i>
IT'S NOT.

19:36.256 --> 19:38.216
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE DOING
ALL THE COOKING THEN.

19:38.216 --> 19:41.052
<i>YOU'RE MAKING DRAMA</i>
<i>FOR NOTHING.</i>

19:41.052 --> 19:43.180
FAY IS OVER MY SHOULDER,
MICROMANAGING

19:43.180 --> 19:45.223
AND JUST CONSTANTLY BOSSING US
IN THE KITCHEN.

19:45.223 --> 19:47.350
<i>THERE'S NO TIME</i>
<i>FOR BURNING MEAT.</i>

19:47.350 --> 19:48.602
I'M JUST OVER IT ALL.

19:48.602 --> 19:51.396
CAN YOU TAKE THIS,
PLEASE?

19:55.275 --> 19:59.279
ONE ITEM
I COULD STAND BEHIND.

19:59.279 --> 20:01.239
THIS IS OUR ZAYNA COMBO PLATE.

20:01.239 --> 20:03.617
THANK YOU, DARLING.
WOW.

20:03.617 --> 20:03.910
<i>INSTANTLY, YOU CAN SEE</i>
<i>IT'S DRY, SLICING IN THERE.</i>

20:03.910 --> 20:06.244
<i>INSTANTLY, YOU CAN SEE</i>
<i>IT'S DRY, SLICING IN THERE.</i>

20:07.579 --> 20:09.289
MM. WOW.

20:09.289 --> 20:11.208
AND THIS ONE IS THE...

20:11.208 --> 20:13.210
THAT'S JUST
A REGULAR BEEF KABOB.

20:13.210 --> 20:15.253
THE MEAT IS JUST
LIKE IT'S BOILED.

20:15.253 --> 20:16.296
IT'S JUST TASTELESS.

20:16.296 --> 20:18.215
EVERYTHING'S SO OVERCOOKED.

20:18.215 --> 20:19.341
WE TRY TO MAKE
OUR MEAT MEDIUM.

20:19.341 --> 20:22.052
BUT THAT LOOKS MEDIUM-WELL,
WELL-DONE.

20:22.052 --> 20:24.554
IT'S DRIER
THAN MARK'S PERSONALITY.

20:24.554 --> 20:28.141
<i>AND THE KOFTA, SADLY,</i>
<i>IS OVERCOOKED AND DRY.</i>

20:28.141 --> 20:30.477
IT'S DRIER THAN THE SANDS
AROUND THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT.

20:30.477 --> 20:31.978
DREADFUL.

20:31.978 --> 20:33.146
AND THE CHICKEN IS BLAND.

20:33.146 --> 20:33.910
IS THE CHICKEN FRESH,
OR IS THAT FROZEN?

20:33.910 --> 20:34.731
IS THE CHICKEN FRESH,
OR IS THAT FROZEN?

20:34.731 --> 20:36.024
<i>THE CHICKEN IS FROZEN.</i>

20:36.024 --> 20:37.317
<i>WHAT A SHAME.</i>

20:37.317 --> 20:38.902
WHO COOKED MY LUNCH TODAY?

20:38.902 --> 20:40.487
THAT WOULD BE A MIXTURE
OF FAY AND BRENDA.

20:40.487 --> 20:43.615
I THINK THEY TAG-TEAMED
ON THE DISHES.

20:43.615 --> 20:45.116
SUPPOSING YOU TAG-TEAM,

20:45.116 --> 20:46.409
YOU'D EXPECT IT
TO BE TWICE AS GOOD.

20:46.409 --> 20:47.786
BUT THIS ONE'S TWICE AS BAD.

20:47.786 --> 20:49.454
<i>DARLING, I'M DONE.</i>

20:49.454 --> 20:51.581
<i>WOW, THAT WAS DISAPPOINTING.</i>

20:51.581 --> 20:53.291
THANK YOU, DARLING.

20:53.291 --> 20:55.335
WOW.

20:55.335 --> 21:00.173
TRUST ME, THIS HAS BEEN
A HUGE, HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.

21:00.173 --> 21:02.676
THERE HAS NOT BEEN ONE THING
THAT HE SAID HE LIKED.

21:02.676 --> 21:03.910
<i>NOT EVEN ONE ITEM, HUH?</i>

21:03.910 --> 21:04.427
<i>NOT EVEN ONE ITEM, HUH?</i>

21:04.427 --> 21:08.974
LET'S COME OVER, PLEASE.

21:08.974 --> 21:10.517
WOW. I DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO START, REALLY.

21:10.517 --> 21:14.271
<i>FAY, BRENDA,</i>
<i>I AM SO DISAPPOINTED.</i>

21:14.271 --> 21:16.815
<i>THE ATMOSPHERE'S FLAT.</i>

21:16.815 --> 21:18.149
THE DECOR'S DRAB.

21:18.149 --> 21:22.028
<i>AND I'M SAT ON THE CORNER</i>
<i>OF A RIDICULOUS CUSHION</i>

21:22.028 --> 21:26.157
OPPOSITE A LARGE CONTAINER
OF DIRTY.

21:26.157 --> 21:27.993
THEY'VE NEVER
DONE THAT BEFORE.

21:27.993 --> 21:29.119
<i>THAT'S WHAT'S BOTHERING ME</i>
<i>TODAY.</i>

21:29.119 --> 21:30.954
UM, EXCUSE ME.

21:30.954 --> 21:32.789
WE DO THAT EVERY WEEK.

21:32.789 --> 21:33.910
I BELIEVE YOU AND VANESSA
USE BUCKETS, DON'T YOU?

21:33.910 --> 21:35.083
I BELIEVE YOU AND VANESSA
USE BUCKETS, DON'T YOU?

21:35.083 --> 21:36.543
BUT DON'T PUT THE BUCKETS
ON THE FLOOR.

21:36.543 --> 21:37.961
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF IT'S ON THE FLOOR.

21:37.961 --> 21:39.296
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE ISSUE.

21:39.296 --> 21:40.255
I THINK THE FACT
THAT THE BUCKET'S

21:40.255 --> 21:41.464
<i>IN VIEW OF THE CUSTOMERS--</i>
THEY FILL THEM,

21:41.464 --> 21:43.091
AND THEY WALK INSIDE THE KITCHEN
WITH THEM.

21:43.091 --> 21:46.553
BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD
TO USE A BUCKET.

21:46.553 --> 21:47.888
I ALWAYS ASKED YOU GUYS
TO USE A BUCKET,

21:47.888 --> 21:51.057
SO STUFF DOESN'T SPILL
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

21:51.057 --> 21:54.311
BUT WE'VE NEVER SAID
TO PUT IT ON THE FLOOR.

21:55.896 --> 21:57.355
YEAH, YOU USE THE TABLE
OR ONE OF THE CHAIRS,

21:57.355 --> 21:59.524
AND YOU TAKE THEM BACK INSIDE
WHEN THEY'RE ALMOST FULL.

21:59.524 --> 22:01.192
BUT THEY'RE STILL
IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMERS

22:01.192 --> 22:02.944
<i>IF WE LEAVE THEM ON THE CHAIR--</i>
WE NEVER PUT THEM
ON THE FLOOR.

22:02.944 --> 22:03.910
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

22:03.910 --> 22:04.112
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

22:04.112 --> 22:06.323
DO WE LEAVE THEM ON THE FLOOR?
NEVER.

22:06.323 --> 22:07.574
- YES.
<i>- WOW.</i>

22:07.574 --> 22:11.995
BUT SET ALL THAT ASIDE.
I'VE JUST HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE.

22:11.995 --> 22:14.372
AND I FELT
THE FOOD WAS BELOW STANDARD.

22:14.372 --> 22:16.875
<i>THE HUMMUS WAS RUNNY,</i>
<i>VERY LIQUIDY.</i>

22:16.875 --> 22:19.336
WHY SO MUCH OIL ON THERE?

22:19.336 --> 22:22.213
I HAVE ARABIC CUSTOMERS
THAT LIKE LOADS OF OLIVE OIL.

22:22.213 --> 22:24.215
WHEN CUSTOMERS WANT MORE OIL,

22:24.215 --> 22:26.176
DON'T ASSUME THAT EVERYBODY
WANTS MORE OIL.

22:26.176 --> 22:27.427
<i>I DON'T EVEN THINK</i>
<i>IT WAS OLIVE OIL.</i>

22:27.427 --> 22:28.428
WHAT WAS THAT OIL IN THERE?

22:28.428 --> 22:30.013
OLIVE OIL.
IT WAS OLIVE OIL.

22:30.013 --> 22:31.514
WOW. THAT MUST BE CHEAP.

22:32.933 --> 22:33.910
WHAT'S FUNNY?

22:33.910 --> 22:34.559
WHAT'S FUNNY?

22:34.559 --> 22:36.227
UM, OUR PRODUCT'S NOT CHEAP.

22:36.227 --> 22:37.646
YOUR PRODUCT'S NOT CHEAP?

22:37.646 --> 22:39.230
OKAY.
SO WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

22:39.230 --> 22:41.232
YOU SAID IT WAS CHEAP.

22:41.232 --> 22:42.317
IT TASTED CHEAP.

22:42.317 --> 22:43.985
IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE,
BUT IT'S NOT CHEAP.

22:43.985 --> 22:45.278
OKAY, I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE
WITH YOU.

22:45.278 --> 22:47.238
BUT YOU SIT THERE ON YOUR ASS,
LAUGHING YOUR HEAD OFF,

22:47.238 --> 22:48.531
<i>THINKING IT'S FUNNY.</i>

22:48.531 --> 22:50.408
I'M NOT GONNA GET UPSET
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAY.
NO?

22:50.408 --> 22:52.369
<i>I'M JUST GONNA SMILE ABOUT IT.</i>
<i>IT'S YOUR OPINION.</i>

22:52.369 --> 22:54.287
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
26, SIR.

22:54.287 --> 22:56.122
I'D EXPECT THAT
IF YOU WERE 16.

22:56.122 --> 23:00.251
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW, MARK,
IT'S VERY FAR FROM FUNNY.

23:00.251 --> 23:01.920
CAN I CONTINUE
ABOUT MY LUNCH?

23:01.920 --> 23:03.910
FOR ME, A KOFTA,
WHEN YOU BITE INTO IT,

23:03.910 --> 23:04.089
FOR ME, A KOFTA,
WHEN YOU BITE INTO IT,

23:04.089 --> 23:06.257
<i>IT JUST BURSTS</i>
<i>WITH FLAVOR.</i>

23:06.257 --> 23:07.384
THIS THING WAS DRY
BEYOND BELIEF.

23:07.384 --> 23:09.094
BUT THIS IS NUMBER ONE SELLER.

23:09.094 --> 23:12.764
THIS IS WHAT MY CUSTOMER EATS
EVERY TIME THEY WALK IN.

23:12.764 --> 23:15.976
BUT, FAY, CHICKEN WAS DRY,
AND THE BEEF WAS DRY.

23:15.976 --> 23:17.268
IS THAT PROTEIN FROZEN?

23:17.268 --> 23:18.478
WE BUY IT FRESH.

23:18.478 --> 23:20.105
I BUY IT FRESH,
AND I MARINATE IT.
BUY IT FRESH...

23:20.105 --> 23:21.690
THEN I HAVE TO FREEZE IT.

23:21.690 --> 23:24.275
SO THERE'S A SYSTEM--
PREP, FREEZE, AND COOK.

23:24.275 --> 23:27.654
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU THINK
CUSTOMERS LEAVE THEIR HOMES

23:27.654 --> 23:29.239
TO COME AND EAT FROZEN FOOD.

23:29.239 --> 23:31.032
I DON'T HAVE
A WALK-IN FREEZER,

23:31.032 --> 23:32.492
AND I DON'T HAVE
A WALK-IN COOLER.

23:32.492 --> 23:33.910
OKAY.

23:33.910 --> 23:34.285
OKAY.

23:34.285 --> 23:36.162
SO MY OPTION IS TO FREEZE IT,
THEN COOK IT.

23:36.162 --> 23:38.123
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
FUNCTIONING LIKE THIS?

23:38.123 --> 23:40.250
18 MONTHS--2 YEARS.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.085
NO, IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS
SINCE DAY ONE.

23:44.671 --> 23:46.673
I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

23:46.673 --> 23:51.386
THAT I DON'T HAVE THE HELP
TO PREPARE WHEN I NEED HELP.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.221
<i>RIGHT.</i>

23:53.221 --> 23:55.515
I CANNOT CUT MYSELF IN HALF,
HAVE MY HALF HERE

23:55.515 --> 23:58.560
BEHIND THE COUNTER,
AND THE OTHER HALF INSIDE.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.728
SURE.
BUT, FAY, HAVE YOU GIVEN UP?

23:59.728 --> 24:01.104
NO.

24:01.104 --> 24:02.105
<i>DO YOU WANT TO GIVE UP?</i>

24:02.105 --> 24:03.910
NO.

24:03.910 --> 24:04.024
NO.

24:12.032 --> 24:14.034
WHAT?
I NEED HELP.

24:14.034 --> 24:15.660
<i>FROM YOUR FAMILY?</i>
YES.

24:15.660 --> 24:18.455
<i>SO WHO'S NOT PULLING</i>
<i>THEIR WEIGHT?</i>
NONE OF THEM.

24:26.331 --> 24:27.415
CHICKEN WAS DRY.

24:27.415 --> 24:29.959
BUT THIS IS
NUMBER ONE SELLER.

24:29.959 --> 24:32.045
FAY NOT ONLY BELIEVES
THAT HER FOOD IS IMPECCABLE...

24:32.045 --> 24:33.922
I NEED HELP.

24:33.922 --> 24:36.508
SHE ALSO BELIEVES THAT SHE IS
THE ONLY ONE IN THIS RESTAURANT

24:36.508 --> 24:38.301
WHO IS PUTTING IN
A REAL EFFORT.

24:38.301 --> 24:41.429
SO WHO'S NOT PULLING
THEIR WEIGHT?

24:41.429 --> 24:43.348
NONE OF THEM.

24:43.348 --> 24:44.307
<i>NONE OF US?</i>

24:44.307 --> 24:46.184
YOU DON'T
LET ANYBODY HELP YOU.

24:46.184 --> 24:48.853
<i>BRENDA, WHAT'S GOING ON?</i>

24:48.853 --> 24:50.939
IS YOUR AUNTIE ON HER OWN?

24:50.939 --> 24:51.919
SHE'S NOT ON HER OWN.
SHE'S NOT.

24:51.919 --> 24:54.776
SHE'S NOT ON HER OWN.
SHE'S NOT.

24:54.776 --> 24:56.986
SHE HAS TO HAVE HER HAND
IN EVERYTHING.

24:56.986 --> 24:58.947
<i>SHE HAS TO MARINATE.</i>
<i>SHE HAS TO CUT.</i>

24:58.947 --> 25:00.073
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

25:00.073 --> 25:01.824
THAT IS TRUE.

25:01.824 --> 25:03.910
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU CUT
THE CHICKEN OR LAMB OR BEEF

25:03.910 --> 25:04.911
AND YOU MARINATE IT?

25:04.911 --> 25:06.246
MANY, MANY TIMES.

25:06.246 --> 25:07.205
<i>WHEN?</i>

25:07.205 --> 25:08.414
<i>MANY TIMES.</i>

25:08.414 --> 25:09.832
<i>NO, THAT'S A LIE.</i>
<i>AND YOU KNOW THAT.</i>

25:09.832 --> 25:11.125
MANY TIMES.
IT'S NOT A LIE.

25:11.125 --> 25:13.253
I ALWAYS STAND WITH YOU
IN THE BACK AND ASK YOU,

25:13.253 --> 25:15.421
<i>"SHOW ME HOW TO DO THIS.</i>
<i>SHOW ME HOW TO DO THAT."</i>

25:15.421 --> 25:16.422
I ALWAYS TELL YOU WHAT?

25:16.422 --> 25:17.549
BRING A PIECE OF PAPER AND PEN
AND WRITE IT.

25:17.549 --> 25:19.133
<i>NO, YOU DON'T.</i>
<i>NO, YOU DON'T.</i>

25:19.133 --> 25:21.844
YOU DON'T SAY, "HEY, COME HERE.
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS,

25:21.844 --> 25:21.919
<i>SO IF I'M EVER OFF,</i>
<i>YOU COULD DO IT."</i>

25:21.919 --> 25:24.556
<i>SO IF I'M EVER OFF,</i>
<i>YOU COULD DO IT."</i>

25:24.556 --> 25:25.848
YOU'VE NOT BEEN SHOWN
THE RECIPES?

25:25.848 --> 25:27.100
NO.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.269
UM, SHE NEVER ASK,
SO SHE SEE ME...

25:29.269 --> 25:30.645
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
<i>SHE SEE ME WHEN I MARINATE.</i>

25:30.645 --> 25:32.146
I ALWAYS GO IN--

25:32.146 --> 25:34.065
SHE'S WORKED WITH ME
ALMOST EVERY TIME I'M HERE.

25:34.065 --> 25:36.442
MANY TIMES,
I BROUGHT IN MY LAPTOP,

25:36.442 --> 25:37.860
AND I SAID, "LET'S GO
THROUGH THE RECIPES."

25:37.860 --> 25:42.448
IF SHE CAME AND TELL ME,
"I WANTED TO LEARN THIS,"

25:42.448 --> 25:43.700
I WOULD NEVER TELL HER NO.

25:43.700 --> 25:45.201
<i>I WOULD NEVER TELL HER NO.</i>

25:45.201 --> 25:46.744
YOU ALWAYS SAY, FAY,
"I HAVE TO DO IT."

25:46.744 --> 25:48.663
THEY CAN BRING
A PIECE OF PAPER

25:48.663 --> 25:50.206
<i>AND BRING ANYTIME</i>
<i>WHEN I'M DOING SOMETHING</i>

25:50.206 --> 25:51.374
AND WRITE WHAT I DO.

25:51.374 --> 25:51.919
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

25:51.919 --> 25:52.959
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

25:52.959 --> 25:57.839
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE
SHOWN HOW TO COOK SOMETHING?

25:57.839 --> 25:58.965
NEVER?

25:58.965 --> 26:00.258
MINOR STUFF IN THE KITCHEN...

26:00.258 --> 26:01.384
<i>SERIOUSLY?</i>

26:01.384 --> 26:02.885
LIKE APPETIZERS.
BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

26:02.885 --> 26:05.388
REALLY? IN FIVE YEARS?
YES. YES.

26:05.388 --> 26:08.808
YOU TWO DON'T SOUND
LIKE A NIECE AND AN AUNTIE.

26:08.808 --> 26:10.435
<i>WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME</i>
<i>YOUR AUNTIE GAVE YOU</i>

26:10.435 --> 26:11.644
<i>A COMPLIMENT ABOUT SOMETHING?</i>

26:11.644 --> 26:13.938
I DON'T GET COMPLIMENTS.

26:13.938 --> 26:15.857
WHEN SHE COOKS, ALL I HEAR
FROM THE CUSTOMER IS COMPLAINTS.

26:15.857 --> 26:18.443
THERE'S--
NOBODY GETS COMPLIMENTED.

26:18.443 --> 26:19.944
SHE ONLY COOKS
WHEN I'M NOT HERE.

26:19.944 --> 26:21.919
<i>JUST THE LAST WEEK,</i>
<i>ON WEDNESDAY, I WAS OFF.</i>

26:21.919 --> 26:22.405
<i>JUST THE LAST WEEK,</i>
<i>ON WEDNESDAY, I WAS OFF.</i>

26:22.405 --> 26:26.367
ON THURSDAY, A CUSTOMER WALKS IN
JUST TO COMPLAIN

26:26.367 --> 26:28.286
ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE THE FOOD WAS
WHEN I'M NOT HERE.

26:28.286 --> 26:29.954
I'VE NEVER BEEN TOLD THAT.

26:29.954 --> 26:31.289
AND I'M NOT SAYING, BECAUSE YOU
DON'T TAKE IT WELL FROM ME.

26:31.289 --> 26:32.874
THEN YOU SHOULD TELL ME.

26:32.874 --> 26:35.043
I TOLD YOU SO MANY TIMES.
YOU DON'T TAKE IT WELL FROM ME.

26:35.043 --> 26:37.462
WHEN DID YOU TELL ME?
WHEN?

26:37.462 --> 26:39.380
WHEN THE FALAFEL IS DRY,
AND IT WAS BURNED--

26:39.380 --> 26:40.715
THE FALAFEL WAS PERFECT.

26:40.715 --> 26:41.924
<i>I GOT SO MANY FEEDBACK.</i>

26:41.924 --> 26:43.384
<i>THAT'S NOT TRUE.</i>

26:43.384 --> 26:45.094
I AM VERY PICKY HOW EVERYTHING'S
COOKED ON THE GRILL.

26:45.094 --> 26:46.512
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

26:46.512 --> 26:48.181
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
ASK THE SERVERS.

26:48.181 --> 26:50.850
THE SERVER COOKS THE FOOD WHEN
YOU'RE HERE MOST OF THE TIME.

26:50.850 --> 26:51.919
NO, THEY DON'T.

26:51.919 --> 26:52.352
NO, THEY DON'T.

26:52.352 --> 26:54.020
YOU DON'T COOK ALL THE TIME
WHEN SHE'S HERE?

26:54.020 --> 26:55.605
<i>NO.</i>

26:55.605 --> 26:57.023
NO, I WANT HER TO ANSWER.

26:57.023 --> 26:59.317
<i>SO I SIT ON MY ASS</i>
<i>WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE IS WORKING?</i>

26:59.317 --> 27:00.401
<i>YES.</i>

27:00.401 --> 27:03.905
AND I TELL YOU,
"FIND SOMETHING TO DO."

27:03.905 --> 27:07.533
I'VE OFFERED TO CUT CHICKEN
MULTIPLE TIMES FOR FREE,

27:07.533 --> 27:09.118
<i>AND I WAS TOLD</i>
<i>THAT I WASN'T ALLOWED TO DO IT.</i>

27:09.118 --> 27:10.244
<i>BUT I'M CONFUSED.</i>

27:10.244 --> 27:12.413
YOU WANT THEM TO DO IT,

27:12.413 --> 27:13.665
BUT THEN THEY SAY
YOU DON'T LET THEM DO IT.

27:13.665 --> 27:15.458
NO, THEY DON'T WANT TO.

27:15.458 --> 27:17.251
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

27:17.251 --> 27:18.503
THAT'S THE GOD-HONEST TRUTH.
<i>THAT'S NOT TRUE.</i>

27:18.503 --> 27:20.046
I OFFERED.
I WASN'T ALLOWED TO DO IT.

27:20.046 --> 27:21.297
<i>NO, SHE NEVER DID.</i>

27:21.297 --> 27:21.919
SHE NEVER DID WORK FOR FREE.

27:21.919 --> 27:23.549
SHE NEVER DID WORK FOR FREE.

27:23.549 --> 27:25.343
I'VE OFFERED TO WORK FOR FREE
TO LEARN HOW TO CUT THE CHICKEN

27:25.343 --> 27:26.719
AND HELP HER DURING THE WEEK.

27:26.719 --> 27:28.304
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE WITH ME
IN THE KITCHEN.

27:28.304 --> 27:30.098
<i>NO, I'M SAYING YOU TOLD ME--</i>

27:30.098 --> 27:31.849
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE WITH ME
IN THE KITCHEN,

27:31.849 --> 27:34.644
AND THAT'S WHY
I WILL NEVER TELL YOU ANYTHING.

27:34.644 --> 27:36.396
I'M AFRAID
THAT SHE GETS HURT.

27:36.396 --> 27:38.398
WHEN SHE'S WORKING HER REGULAR
SHIFT AND NOT EVEN COOKING,

27:38.398 --> 27:39.649
SHE'S HURTING HERSELF.

27:39.649 --> 27:41.275
I DON'T USUALLY HURT MYSELF.

27:41.275 --> 27:43.569
"I NEED A BANDAGE."

27:43.569 --> 27:45.488
<i>EVERY DAY,</i>
<i>AMEL NEEDS A BANDAGE.</i>

27:45.488 --> 27:47.448
I'VE NEVER POKED MYSELF
WITH A KNIFE HERE.

27:47.448 --> 27:49.867
AMEL, YOU ASK FOR BANDAGE
ALL THE TIME.

27:49.867 --> 27:51.327
NO, I REALLY DON'T.

27:51.327 --> 27:51.919
WOW.

27:51.919 --> 27:52.453
WOW.

27:52.453 --> 27:53.496
IN THE END,
IT'S NOT MY JOB TO COOK.

27:53.496 --> 27:54.789
<i>I DON'T GET PAID TO COOK.</i>

27:54.789 --> 27:56.749
I DON'T GET PAID
TO DO INVENTORY.

27:56.749 --> 27:58.584
<i>I DON'T GET PAID ANY EXTRA</i>
<i>TO DO ANYTHING.</i>

27:58.584 --> 28:00.336
BUT AS A FAMILY, WE DO IT
JUST BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT THE--

28:00.336 --> 28:01.629
YOU DO MY INVENTORY?

28:01.629 --> 28:03.005
I'VE DONE
THE TAKEOUT INVENTORY.

28:03.005 --> 28:04.424
<i>IT'S NOT MINE.</i>

28:04.424 --> 28:06.426
IT'S INVENTORY.
SHE DIDN'T SAY YOUR INVENTORY.

28:06.426 --> 28:07.593
<i>I DO THE BREAD INVENTORY.</i>

28:07.593 --> 28:09.387
MAYBE A FEW TIME,
BUT NOT ALL THE TIME.

28:09.387 --> 28:11.431
NOT ALL THE TIME
BECAUSE I HAVE MY OWN JOB TO DO.

28:11.431 --> 28:13.141
<i>AND WHEN I COME IN,</i>
<i>AND THE DINING ROOM'S DIRTY,</i>

28:13.141 --> 28:14.434
MY FIRST THING TO DO IS--

28:14.434 --> 28:16.018
WHY IS THE DINING ROOM
DIRTY?

28:16.018 --> 28:19.105
'CAUSE THE STAFF FROM
THE NIGHT BEFORE DON'T CLEAN.

28:19.105 --> 28:20.398
REALLY?

28:20.398 --> 28:21.919
WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING,
MARK DOES NOT DO IT.

28:21.919 --> 28:22.733
WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING,
MARK DOES NOT DO IT.

28:22.733 --> 28:24.360
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE LENIENCE--

28:24.360 --> 28:25.820
DON'T SAY THAT.

28:25.820 --> 28:27.613
<i>DON'T POINT FINGERS,</i>
<i>BECAUSE THAT  HAPPENS.</i>

28:27.613 --> 28:30.324
I'VE CAME RIGHT AFTER YOU SWEPT,
AND I'VE SWEPT,

28:30.324 --> 28:32.368
AND IT'S BEEN DIRTY.

28:32.368 --> 28:35.079
<i>BY FAR, SHE DOES WAY MORE</i>
<i>OF HER DUTIES</i>

28:35.079 --> 28:36.497
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE.
BUT IT GOES BOTH WAYS.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.291
IS MARK LAZY?

28:38.291 --> 28:39.959
NO, HE'S NOT.
<i>HE'S NOT LAZY?</i>

28:39.959 --> 28:41.752
<i>ACTUALLY, HE WORKS</i>
<i>THE BUSIEST NIGHTS.</i>

28:41.752 --> 28:43.254
<i>HE WORKS THE BUSIEST NIGHTS,</i>

28:43.254 --> 28:44.797
<i>BUT WHEN IT COMES</i>
<i>TO BUSSING AND CLEANING</i>

28:44.797 --> 28:46.257
AND PULLING HIS ROPE,
HE DOESN'T PULL IT.

28:46.257 --> 28:48.968
MARK DOES NOT PULL HIS ROPE
WHEN IT COMES TO HIS DUTIES.

28:48.968 --> 28:51.429
IF YOU WANT TO START
POINTING FINGERS, BRENDA...

28:51.429 --> 28:51.919
NO!
I WAS GONNA KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT

28:51.919 --> 28:52.972
NO!
I WAS GONNA KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT

28:52.972 --> 28:54.348
AND NOT SAY
ABOUT ANYONE.

28:54.348 --> 28:56.225
WHEN YOU JUST SIT
ON YOUR  PHONE,

28:56.225 --> 28:58.352
<i>WE'RE COOKING, SERVING,</i>
<i>AND YOU'RE SITTING--</i>

28:58.352 --> 29:00.146
<i>NEGATIVE, AND IF I NEED--</i>

29:00.146 --> 29:02.315
WHATEVER.
SO I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

29:02.315 --> 29:04.192
<i>IF I'M GONNA SIT DOWN AND</i>
<i>ACTUALLY PUT FOOD IN MY MOUTH--</i>
IT'S OKAY. GO FOR IT, BRENDA.

29:04.192 --> 29:06.360
GO AHEAD, WALK OUT
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.862
WHEN YOU'RE HERE
FOR FIVE HOURS?

29:07.862 --> 29:09.447
<i>YEAH. NO, I'M NOT HERE</i>
<i>FOR FIVE HOURS.</i>

29:09.447 --> 29:11.324
<i>YOU ARE!</i>

29:18.956 --> 29:22.501
THIS IMPROMPTU STAFF MEETING
HAS GONE FROM BRENDA AND FAY

29:22.501 --> 29:24.211
POINTING FINGERS
AT EACH OTHER...

29:24.211 --> 29:25.545
NO, WHEN THE FALAFEL IS DRY--

29:25.545 --> 29:27.673
THE FALAFEL WAS PERFECT.

29:27.673 --> 29:29.508
TO THE BLAME GAME
WITH THE ENTIRE STAFF...

29:29.508 --> 29:30.968
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE LENIENCE--

29:30.968 --> 29:32.469
DON'T SAY THAT.
DON'T POINT FINGERS.

29:32.469 --> 29:33.553
<i>CAN I FINISH?</i>

29:33.553 --> 29:35.222
INCLUDING FAY'S SON, MARK.

29:35.222 --> 29:36.348
IF YOU WANT TO START
POINTING FINGERS, BRENDA,

29:36.348 --> 29:38.475
WHEN YOU JUST SIT
ON YOUR  PHONE,

29:38.475 --> 29:40.352
<i>WE'RE COOKING, SERVING,</i>
<i>AND YOU'RE SITTING--</i>

29:40.352 --> 29:41.353
<i>NEGATIVE.</i>

29:41.353 --> 29:43.605
WHATEVER.

29:43.605 --> 29:45.003
GO AHEAD, WALK OUT
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

29:45.003 --> 29:45.691
GO AHEAD, WALK OUT
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

29:45.691 --> 29:47.317
WHEN YOU'RE HERE
FOR FIVE HOURS?

29:47.317 --> 29:48.860
<i>YEAH. NO, I'M NOT HERE</i>
<i>FOR FIVE HOURS.</i>

29:48.860 --> 29:52.280
YOU ARE!

29:52.280 --> 29:55.701
WHATEVER.

29:55.701 --> 29:57.953
I WASN'T GONNA TALK
ABOUT ANYBODY, BUT OKAY.

29:57.953 --> 30:00.288
<i>I'LL BE YELLED AT,</i>

30:00.288 --> 30:01.289
TAKING FOOD TO THE THIRD TABLE
OVER THERE.

30:01.289 --> 30:02.290
<i>BY WHO?</i>

30:02.290 --> 30:03.500
<i>BY FAYZA.</i>

30:03.500 --> 30:04.710
<i>SHE WILL SCREAM AT ME</i>
<i>AS I'M WALKING.</i>

30:04.710 --> 30:08.171
IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMERS?
BECAUSE I ASK THE TV TO BE OFF.

30:08.171 --> 30:09.506
NO, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE TV.

30:09.506 --> 30:10.632
THESE ARE DIFFERENT ISSUES.

30:10.632 --> 30:13.677
I HAVE TO SCREAM AT YOU,
"TURN OFF THE TV,"

30:13.677 --> 30:15.003
BECAUSE IT HAVE
SOME BUMPING AND GRINDING

30:15.003 --> 30:16.054
BECAUSE IT HAVE
SOME BUMPING AND GRINDING

30:16.054 --> 30:17.347
AND WHATEVER IS GOING ON
ON TV.

30:17.347 --> 30:18.724
BUMPING?

30:18.724 --> 30:19.766
<i>AND IT PISSES ME OFF,</i>
<i>BECAUSE I WALK FROM INSIDE--</i>

30:19.766 --> 30:21.059
BUMPING AND GRINDING?
ON WHAT?

30:21.059 --> 30:22.853
THERE'S NOT BUMPING
AND GRINDING.

30:22.853 --> 30:24.354
AMERICAN VIDEO CHANNEL.

30:24.354 --> 30:26.398
<i>THE SOLUTION BRENDA HAVE</i>
<i>TO CHANGE</i>

30:26.398 --> 30:28.525
HER SHIFT
BECAUSE I VOICE MY OPINION.

30:28.525 --> 30:32.404
I CHANGED THE SHIFT BECAUSE
YOU GUYS CONSTANTLY BUMP HEADS,

30:32.404 --> 30:35.407
AND YOU CONSTANTLY GET
INTO THESE GREAT ARGUMENTS

30:35.407 --> 30:37.242
IN THIS OPEN KITCHEN
AND THE DINING ROOM.

30:37.242 --> 30:38.285
<i>IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS?</i>

30:38.285 --> 30:39.369
<i>YES.</i>
IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS.

30:39.369 --> 30:40.537
WOW.

30:40.537 --> 30:44.666
UM, I NEED TO SEE THIS PLACE
WORKING TONIGHT.

30:44.666 --> 30:45.003
<i>JUST DO WHAT YOU NORMALLY DO,</i>

30:45.003 --> 30:46.668
<i>JUST DO WHAT YOU NORMALLY DO,</i>

30:46.668 --> 30:48.879
SO I CAN HAVE A CHANCE
OF GETTING UP TO SPEED

30:48.879 --> 30:50.047
TO SEE
HOW THIS PLACE FUNCTIONS.

30:50.047 --> 30:51.882
<i>I'M GETTING SOME FRESH AIR.</i>

30:51.882 --> 30:54.176
WHAT A LUNCH.
I'LL BE BACK LATER.

30:54.176 --> 30:55.510
THANK YOU, SIR.

30:55.510 --> 30:58.638
WOW, AND I THOUGHT THE PROBLEMS
WERE JUST THE FOOD.

31:01.224 --> 31:02.642
I CAN'T HANDLE THIS.

31:02.642 --> 31:05.062
NOBODY HERE IS PERFECT.

31:05.062 --> 31:06.521
NOBODY HERE
IS PERFECT.

31:06.521 --> 31:07.898
YOU JUST MAKE IT SEEM LIKE
WHEN MARK AND VANESSA ARE HERE--

31:07.898 --> 31:10.067
IT HAPPENS WHEN ALL OF US
ARE HERE, BRENDA.

31:10.067 --> 31:12.235
BUT YOU GUYS
DON'T PULL YOUR WEIGHT.

31:12.235 --> 31:14.654
NOBODY PULLS THEIR WEIGHT,
AND THAT'S WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

31:14.654 --> 31:15.003
I WISH...
I WISH...

31:15.003 --> 31:16.323
I WISH...
I WISH...

31:20.410 --> 31:22.079
HERE.

31:22.079 --> 31:23.080
SHE WORKS.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.498
<i>I NEVER TOLD YOU--</i>

31:24.498 --> 31:26.291
NOBODY HERE WORKS
LIKE THE WAY SHE WORKS.

31:26.291 --> 31:28.502
HER MOUTH,
YES, I AGREE.

31:28.502 --> 31:33.256
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HER WORK,
SHE GOES THE EXTRA MILE.

31:33.256 --> 31:36.093
HER MOUTH IS WHAT GETS HER
IN TROUBLE.

31:36.093 --> 31:37.469
SHE'S AN AWESOME WORKER,

31:37.469 --> 31:39.387
AND SHE NEEDS TO KNOW THAT TOO
TO WORK BETTER.

31:39.387 --> 31:41.598
I ALWAYS TELL HER.
I ALWAYS TELL HER THAT.

31:41.598 --> 31:45.003
YOU KNOW, NOBODY GETS
COMPLIMENTS HERE, FAY, NOBODY.

31:45.003 --> 31:45.102
YOU KNOW, NOBODY GETS
COMPLIMENTS HERE, FAY, NOBODY.

31:45.102 --> 31:47.437
I TELL HER, "THANK YOU.
WE HAVE A GREAT NIGHT."

31:47.437 --> 31:48.855
<i>"THANK YOU.</i>
<i>HAVE A GOOD NIGHT."</i>

31:48.855 --> 31:50.732
<i>OF COURSE SHE DOESN'T TELL YOU</i>
<i>I TELL HER THAT,</i>

31:50.732 --> 31:55.070
BUT SHE COMES BACK
AND CRY ABOUT THINGS.

31:55.070 --> 31:57.239
<i>AMEL IS NOT MY PROBLEM.</i>

31:57.239 --> 32:01.827
WHAT MY PROBLEM IS
IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE FOOD.

32:01.827 --> 32:04.955
ANYBODY HUNGRY?
I'M EATING MY FROZEN FOOD.

32:04.955 --> 32:07.332
ANYBODY WANT
TO EAT FROZEN FOOD?

32:07.332 --> 32:09.042
<i>I'M GLAD</i>
<i>YOU'RE LAUGHING ABOUT IT.</i>

32:09.042 --> 32:12.671
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

32:15.215 --> 32:17.717
IRONICALLY, THE ONLY THING
THAT FAY AND BRENDA AGREE ON

32:17.717 --> 32:19.052
IS THE FOOD.

32:19.052 --> 32:20.345
I DON'T WANT THIS TO BURN,

32:20.345 --> 32:21.805
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO MAKE MORE.

32:21.805 --> 32:23.473
IT'S NOT GONNA BURN.

32:23.473 --> 32:25.642
UNFORTUNATELY, ASIDE FROM
THEIR ISSUES WITH EACH OTHER,

32:25.642 --> 32:27.102
THAT IS THE RESTAURANT'S
BIGGEST PROBLEM.

32:27.102 --> 32:28.395
OKAY, ARE WE READY?

32:28.395 --> 32:30.021
READY OR NOT,
I HAVE TO BE READY.

32:30.021 --> 32:31.356
<i>WHAT CAN I GET STARTED</i>
<i>FOR YOU TONIGHT?</i>

32:31.356 --> 32:34.776
CAN I GET AN ORDER OF
THE FALAFEL WITH GARLIC SAUCE?

32:34.776 --> 32:36.153
DEFINITELY HUMMUS.
NO DOUBT.

32:36.153 --> 32:37.237
HUMMUS?
YEAH.

32:37.237 --> 32:38.321
YOU GOT IT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

32:38.321 --> 32:39.322
<i>THANK YOU.</i>

32:39.322 --> 32:41.491
OKAY, JUST EXPLAIN TO ME
HOW THE LINE WORKS.

32:41.491 --> 32:42.784
OKAY.

32:42.784 --> 32:45.003
THE TICKETS COME OUT, AND WE
START TO PULL WHATEVER MEATS,

32:45.003 --> 32:45.370
THE TICKETS COME OUT, AND WE
START TO PULL WHATEVER MEATS,

32:45.370 --> 32:47.205
AND WE START COOKING.

32:47.205 --> 32:48.331
WOW.

32:48.331 --> 32:50.000
OKAY, DON'T LET ME STOP YOU.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.295
<i>OKAY, TABLE ONE, SPICY HUMMUS</i>
<i>AND BEEF SHAWARMA WITH ZAYNA.</i>

32:53.295 --> 32:54.421
<i>I GOT IT.</i>

32:54.421 --> 32:56.423
<i>BRENDA...</i>

32:58.383 --> 33:00.010
<i>THAT'S WHY</i>
<i>I GOT THESE JALAPENOS.</i>

33:00.010 --> 33:01.511
USE THEM, PLEASE.

33:01.511 --> 33:03.805
<i>WE'RE GIVING THEM</i>
<i>SPICY HUMMUS, FAY.</i>

33:03.805 --> 33:06.057
SPICY MEANS SPICY.
WHATEVER.

33:06.057 --> 33:07.392
THE HUMMUS STILL LOOKS
VERY WATERY.

33:07.392 --> 33:08.685
IS THIS IT HERE?
YES.

33:08.685 --> 33:10.645
- HOW OFTEN IS THAT MADE?
- EVERY FEW DAYS.

33:10.645 --> 33:12.731
<i>THIS IS NUMBER-ONE SELLER.</i>

33:12.731 --> 33:15.003
SO WITHIN JUST TWO, THREE DAYS,
IT'S FINISHED.

33:15.003 --> 33:15.400
SO WITHIN JUST TWO, THREE DAYS,
IT'S FINISHED.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.360
RIGHT.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.528
<i>THAT'S DISGUSTING.</i>

33:18.528 --> 33:20.280
<i>THIS IS BAD.</i>

33:20.280 --> 33:21.364
THAT HUMMUS IS AWFUL.

33:21.364 --> 33:23.366
<i>AND WHY IS IT SO RUNNY?</i>

33:23.366 --> 33:24.534
<i>THE CONSISTENCY</i>
<i>COULD BE BETTER.</i>

33:24.534 --> 33:26.077
YEAH, JUST A LITTLE BIT.

33:26.077 --> 33:27.370
<i>SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING.</i>
<i>HOW ARE WE?</i>

33:27.370 --> 33:28.288
LADIES, WELCOME.

33:28.288 --> 33:29.456
<i>THE HUMMUS, HOW IS THAT?</i>

33:29.456 --> 33:30.665
A LITTLE BLAND
AND RUNNY.

33:30.665 --> 33:31.666
MY APOLOGIES.

33:37.088 --> 33:39.424
THANK YOU.

33:39.424 --> 33:41.676
"FRESH FOOD SEVEN DAYS A WEEK,"
MY ASS.

33:41.676 --> 33:44.638
HE'S LEAVING?

33:44.638 --> 33:45.003
<i>I DON'T THINK</i>
<i>GORDON RAMSAY LIKES US.</i>

33:45.003 --> 33:47.015
<i>I DON'T THINK</i>
<i>GORDON RAMSAY LIKES US.</i>

33:50.518 --> 33:52.187
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

33:52.187 --> 33:54.648
<i>BRENDA, WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU</i>
<i>FOR SPICY HUMMUS,</i>

33:54.648 --> 33:56.233
<i>THEY WANT SPICY HUMMUS.</i>

33:56.233 --> 33:57.484
ENOUGH.

33:57.484 --> 33:59.194
I DON'T NEED SOMETHING
EXPLAINED TO ME THREE TIMES.

34:02.364 --> 34:03.949
HE'S HERE.
YAY.

34:03.949 --> 34:06.534
WITH CHEF RAMSAY SEEING
SO MANY CUSTOMERS UNSATISFIED

34:06.534 --> 34:08.620
WITH THE SAME WATERY HUMMUS
THAT HE HAD AT LUNCH,

34:08.620 --> 34:11.456
HE HAS RETURNED FROM A TRIP
TO A NEARBY SUPERMARKET...

34:11.456 --> 34:13.500
I'LL SHOW THEM HOW GOOD
THEIR HUMMUS IS.

34:13.500 --> 34:14.876
WITH A PLAN.

34:14.876 --> 34:15.003
SHH. MUM'S THE WORD.
MUM'S THE WORD.

34:15.003 --> 34:16.836
SHH. MUM'S THE WORD.
MUM'S THE WORD.

34:16.836 --> 34:18.255
YES!

34:20.298 --> 34:21.549
THERE WE ARE.

34:21.549 --> 34:23.343
LADIES, THERE WE ARE,
SOME FRESH HUMMUS.

34:23.343 --> 34:24.344
GENTS, THE SAME FOR YOU.

34:24.344 --> 34:25.720
THANKS.
MY APOLOGIES.
SORRY.

34:25.720 --> 34:26.930
THANK YOU.
WAY TOO MUCH OIL.

34:28.473 --> 34:30.392
THAT'S FOR YOU TO SHARE.

34:35.230 --> 34:37.357
MAN, IT'S WORKING.
CREATING A BUZZ HERE.

34:37.357 --> 34:38.483
THEY'RE LOVING IT.

34:38.483 --> 34:40.652
HOLY CRAP!
I'M RUNNING OUT.

34:44.155 --> 34:45.003
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT

34:45.003 --> 34:45.365
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT

34:45.365 --> 34:47.659
THAT STORE-BOUGHT HUMMUS
WOULD BE HIGH IN DEMAND?

34:52.038 --> 34:53.581
<i>HOW WAS THAT?</i>

34:59.504 --> 35:01.673
<i>BRENDA, ALL THE CHICKEN</i>
<i>IS DONE.</i>

35:01.673 --> 35:05.260
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.
I'M MAKING THE DAMN SALAD.

35:05.260 --> 35:08.388
THE CHICKEN WAS JUST--
IT WAS NASTY.

35:08.388 --> 35:09.723
<i>SORRY ABOUT THAT.</i>

35:09.723 --> 35:11.516
OH, NO.
<i>UM...</i>

35:11.516 --> 35:12.517
NO, NO, NO, NO.

35:12.517 --> 35:13.727
THEY'RE ORDERING
COMPLETELY NEW ENTREES.

35:13.727 --> 35:15.003
SHE SAID
SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL.

35:15.003 --> 35:15.020
SHE SAID
SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL.

35:15.020 --> 35:16.438
<i>WHAT HAPPENED HERE?</i>

35:16.438 --> 35:17.439
SHE SAID THE CHICKEN
DIDN'T TASTE GOOD AT ALL.

35:17.439 --> 35:19.858
OH, REALLY?
IT'S DRY.

35:19.858 --> 35:21.443
IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE MINCED
LIKE THAT?

35:21.443 --> 35:25.071
THIS IS EXACTLY THE WAY
IT'S SERVED EVERYWHERE I KNOW.

35:25.071 --> 35:27.657
I NEVER, EVER HAVE SOMEONE
RETURN THE CHICKEN SHAWARMA.

35:27.657 --> 35:29.326
NOT COMPLAINT--
WE HAVE COMPLAINT--

35:29.326 --> 35:30.744
WELL, LISTEN,
DON'T LET ME STOP YOU.

35:30.744 --> 35:31.870
<i>I UNDERSTAND.</i>

35:31.870 --> 35:33.413
LET'S CALL THEM A LIAR.

35:33.413 --> 35:38.460
I NEVER HAVE A COMPLAINT OF DRY
OR OVERCOOKED SHAWARMA.

35:38.460 --> 35:42.297
I TASTED MOST OF THE SHAWARMA,
AND I KNOW DELICIOUS IT IS.

35:42.297 --> 35:45.003
CAN I GO ASK THEM
WHY THEY DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING,

35:45.003 --> 35:45.467
CAN I GO ASK THEM
WHY THEY DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING,

35:45.467 --> 35:47.927
OR, LIKE, WHAT THEIR OPINION IS?
'CAUSE THAT'S JUST--

35:47.927 --> 35:49.512
DO WHAT YOU THINK IS GOOD,
ALL RIGHT, 'CAUSE THAT'S JUST--

35:49.512 --> 35:51.931
'CAUSE THIS HAS NEVER
HAPPENED BEFORE.

35:51.931 --> 35:53.016
<i>HELLO, LADIES.</i>
<i>HOW ARE YOU TODAY?</i>

35:53.016 --> 35:54.517
HI.

35:54.517 --> 35:56.519
YOU'VE SENT BACK EVERYTHING,
SO I JUST WANTED TO COME AND--

35:57.854 --> 35:59.773
WHAT DID YOU NOT LIKE
ABOUT THE ITEMS?

36:01.483 --> 36:04.694
OKAY.

36:04.694 --> 36:06.154
WAS THE FLAVOR--

36:06.154 --> 36:08.239
<i>IT JUST WASN'T--</i>
<i>IT WASN'T FOR YOU.</i>

36:08.239 --> 36:09.324
YEAH.
<i>OKAY.</i>

36:09.324 --> 36:10.950
<i>YOU GUYS ARE DONE?</i>

36:10.950 --> 36:12.118
WHATEVER.

36:12.118 --> 36:14.913
ALL OF THE SUDDEN,
PEOPLE ARE FOOD CRITICS?

36:14.913 --> 36:15.003
<i>WHAT DID THEY SAY?</i>

36:15.003 --> 36:17.248
<i>WHAT DID THEY SAY?</i>

36:17.248 --> 36:18.833
THEY THOUGHT
THE SHAWARMA WAS RUBBERY.

36:18.833 --> 36:20.418
OUR DOLMAS
TASTE LIKE VINEGAR.

36:20.418 --> 36:23.421
STUFF NEVER CAME BACK BEFORE,
NEVER.

36:23.421 --> 36:25.298
WHATEVER. IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT,
THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

36:25.298 --> 36:26.841
WOWZER.

36:26.841 --> 36:28.718
GOD HELP ME.

36:28.718 --> 36:30.679
BEEF KABOB,
IS IT READY?

36:30.679 --> 36:31.888
<i>READY.</i>

36:31.888 --> 36:33.306
THAT AIN'T MEDIUM.

36:33.306 --> 36:34.349
<i>NO, IT'S RAW.</i>

36:34.349 --> 36:35.975
<i>THE BEEF IS STILL COOKING</i>
<i>FOR THAT PLATE.</i>

36:35.975 --> 36:37.394
I'LL FIX IT.
LEAVE IT, LEAVE IT.

36:37.394 --> 36:39.813
SERIOUSLY?
DO WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO.

36:39.813 --> 36:42.440
I'M FED UP WITH FAY DOMINATING
IN THE KITCHEN.

36:42.440 --> 36:43.775
IT'S REALLY HARD
TO DEAL WITH.

36:46.403 --> 36:47.737
THAT ONE'S RAW.

36:49.155 --> 36:51.741
HALF OF THIS BEEF IS WELL,
HALF OF THIS BEEF IS RAW.

36:51.741 --> 36:53.159
BUT THESE ARE MEDIUM.

36:53.159 --> 36:56.204
IF I COOK THEM MORE, THEY WILL
NOT BE MEDIUM ANYMORE.

36:56.204 --> 36:57.455
BUT ONE OF THEM WAS RAW.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING--

36:57.455 --> 36:58.581
<i>OH, SH--</i>

36:58.581 --> 37:00.959
STOP COMMENTING
ON EVERYTHING, PLEASE.

37:00.959 --> 37:02.335
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE I'M THE ONE WHO'S DOING IT.

37:02.335 --> 37:04.087
I CAN'T HANDLE THIS.

37:04.087 --> 37:06.631
AMEL, WHY IS SHE QUICK
TO JUMP DOWN YOUR THROAT?

37:06.631 --> 37:07.799
WHY IS THAT?

37:07.799 --> 37:08.967
I DON'T KNOW.

37:08.967 --> 37:10.510
IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

37:10.510 --> 37:11.761
IT HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY WHO
COMES BACK HERE, EVEN BRENDA.

37:11.761 --> 37:12.929
<i>WOW. BLOODY HELL.</i>

37:12.929 --> 37:14.431
AY, AY, AY.

37:16.015 --> 37:17.434
YOU KNOW WHAT, JUST GO AHEAD--
YOU CAN JUST TAKE IT.

37:17.434 --> 37:18.518
OKAY.
<i>I'M GOOD.</i>

37:18.518 --> 37:19.936
OH, JEEZ.

37:19.936 --> 37:22.355
<i>THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE MEDIUM,</i>
<i>AND IT'S RARE.</i>

37:22.355 --> 37:24.023
LET ME SEE, MARK.
OKAY, THAT'S COOKED.

37:24.023 --> 37:25.358
THAT IS RAW.

37:25.358 --> 37:27.444
<i>I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU, AMEL.</i>

37:27.444 --> 37:28.570
OH, MAN.

37:28.570 --> 37:30.780
- REDO IT.
- IT LOOKS LIKE.

37:33.533 --> 37:35.994
SERIOUSLY, FAY,
YOU'RE MAKING ME LOSE IT.

37:35.994 --> 37:38.371
MY GOD.
FLAMING GRILL.

37:38.371 --> 37:40.206
FLAMING  MESS.

37:41.374 --> 37:43.460
OH, I WANT TO SCREAM.

37:43.460 --> 37:44.919
<i>THAT'S DISGUSTING.</i>

37:44.919 --> 37:45.003
IT'S FROZEN.
WE'RE DONE.

37:45.003 --> 37:46.379
IT'S FROZEN.
WE'RE DONE.

37:46.379 --> 37:47.881
HOW ARE WE?
HOW'S THE FOOD?

37:47.881 --> 37:49.632
IT IS STONE COLD.

37:49.632 --> 37:51.468
<i>YEAH, I HAD THAT FOR LUNCH.</i>
<i>AND IT WASN'T PLEASANT.</i>

37:51.468 --> 37:53.511
MY APOLOGIES.
THANK YOU.

37:53.511 --> 37:55.680
THE CUSTOMERS HAVE GIVEN
A VERY CLEAR VERDICT ON THE FOOD

37:55.680 --> 37:57.682
AT TONIGHT'S DINNER SERVICE.

37:57.682 --> 37:59.934
SO CHEF RAMSAY DECIDES
TO MOVE ON TO AN INSPECTION

37:59.934 --> 38:02.979
OF THE REST OF THE KITCHEN,
INCLUDING THE FOOD STORAGE.

38:02.979 --> 38:05.356
THE FREEZERS ARE BUSY.

38:05.356 --> 38:06.775
MAN.

38:06.775 --> 38:08.526
<i>WOW.</i>

38:08.526 --> 38:12.071
THERE MUST BE THREE TO FOUR
WEEKS' WORTH OF PREP IN THERE.

38:12.071 --> 38:14.532
UGH. WHAT IS THAT?

38:14.532 --> 38:15.003
DOES THAT LOOK APPETIZING?

38:15.003 --> 38:16.284
DOES THAT LOOK APPETIZING?

38:16.284 --> 38:18.620
MEDITERRANEAN, IT'S NOT.
MAN!

38:18.620 --> 38:20.497
THIS ONE, KIBBI MIX.

38:20.497 --> 38:21.790
LEFTOVERS IN A HOME KITCHEN.

38:21.790 --> 38:23.541
NO DATE.
MY GOD.

38:23.541 --> 38:25.919
UGH. DISGUSTING.

38:25.919 --> 38:27.587
GOD, WHAT A MESS.

38:27.587 --> 38:29.506
THIS STUFF
HAS BEEN IN THERE SO LONG,

38:29.506 --> 38:30.965
IT'S ALL FREEZER-BURNT.

38:30.965 --> 38:32.926
ANY CHANCE OF ANY FLAVOR
HAS GONE,

38:32.926 --> 38:35.261
A BIT LIKE THE FLAME
ON THE GRILL.

38:35.261 --> 38:37.388
JUST BOXES OF MEAT
PREPPED IN BULK.

38:37.388 --> 38:39.599
THEY SAY
"FRESH, FLAVORFUL FOOD."

38:39.599 --> 38:42.352
MY ASS.
I SAY FROZEN, FROZEN, FROZEN.

38:42.352 --> 38:43.436
<i>THAT'S GROSS.</i>

38:51.505 --> 38:53.591
IT'S DINNER SERVICE AT ZAYNA.

38:53.591 --> 38:54.675
<i>IT'S RAW.</i>

38:54.675 --> 38:56.177
<i>THE BEEF IS STILL COOKING</i>
<i>FOR THAT PLATE.</i>

38:56.177 --> 38:57.845
I'LL FIX IT.
LEAVE IT, LEAVE IT.

38:57.845 --> 39:01.265
<i>SERIOUSLY?</i>
OH, I WANT TO SCREAM.

39:01.265 --> 39:03.267
AND WHILE FAY AND BRENDA
CONTINUE TO ARGUE

39:03.267 --> 39:04.518
IN THE OPEN KITCHEN...

39:04.518 --> 39:06.395
BOXES OF MEAT PREPPED IN BULK.

39:06.395 --> 39:08.189
CHEF RAMSAY IS UNCOVERING
SOME ALARMING PRACTICES

39:08.189 --> 39:09.357
IN THE BACK KITCHEN...

39:09.357 --> 39:10.733
MY GOD.

39:10.733 --> 39:12.526
WHICH INCLUDE A MASSIVE AMOUNT
OF FROZEN FOOD.

39:12.526 --> 39:15.112
FRESH SALMON.

39:15.112 --> 39:16.781
OH,.
FROZEN SALMON.

39:16.781 --> 39:17.992
<i>UGH. WHAT IS THAT?</i>

39:17.992 --> 39:19.450
<i>UGH. WHAT IS THAT?</i>

39:19.450 --> 39:23.204
WELCOME TO MY MEDITERRANEAN
FLAMING GRILL.

39:23.204 --> 39:25.790
IT'S A BROKE BAG.
LOOKS LIKE LAMB IN THERE.

39:25.790 --> 39:27.083
LOOK AT THAT.

39:27.083 --> 39:28.459
UGH.

39:28.459 --> 39:31.128
DEFROSTING FROZEN MEAT
IN WARM WATER.

39:31.128 --> 39:33.005
WHAT A MESS.

39:33.005 --> 39:35.800
CHICKEN SHAWARMA.
UGH.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.719
DOES THIS LADY REALLY KNOW
HOW TO RUN A RESTAURANT?

39:38.719 --> 39:40.054
I DON'T THINK SO.

39:40.054 --> 39:43.432
THE LOGIC HAS LEFT
THE BUILDING.

39:43.432 --> 39:46.519
<i>THIS IS TOO MANY ORDERS</i>
<i>AND NONE OF THEM ON THE GRILL.</i>

39:46.519 --> 39:47.812
I THOUGHT
YOU TOOK ALL THE MEAT.

39:47.812 --> 39:47.992
I TOOK OUT LAMB.

39:47.992 --> 39:48.938
I TOOK OUT LAMB.

39:48.938 --> 39:50.356
OKAY, IT'S NOT ON THE GRILL.

39:50.356 --> 39:52.566
<i>WELL, IT DISAPPEARED.</i>

39:52.566 --> 39:54.193
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING,
JUST TWO SECONDS?

39:54.193 --> 39:55.569
SURE. SURE.

39:55.569 --> 39:58.572
JUST TO TALK TO YOU
IN PRIVATE.
<i>SURE.</i>

39:58.572 --> 39:59.490
<i>I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU</i>
<i>SOMETHING VERY QUICKLY.</i>

39:59.490 --> 40:00.825
OKAY.

40:00.825 --> 40:02.493
WHAT DID
HE WALK BACK THERE FOR?

40:02.493 --> 40:04.203
THIS WAS IN THE SINK,
IN A BOWL OF WATER.

40:04.203 --> 40:05.871
WE RUN THE WATER ON IT
TO DEFROST IT.

40:05.871 --> 40:08.124
RUNNING HOT WATER ON IT,
WHAT DOES THAT DO?

40:08.124 --> 40:10.751
IT'S NOT HOT WATER.
I RUN COLD WATER.

40:10.751 --> 40:12.795
IT'S WARM ON THE OUTSIDE
AND SOLID IN THE MIDDLE.

40:12.795 --> 40:14.547
SO WHEN IT'S DIFFERENT COLORS
LIKE THAT,

40:14.547 --> 40:16.048
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

40:16.048 --> 40:17.425
THAT MEANS COOKED.

40:17.425 --> 40:17.992
EVEN BEFORE YOU START
TURNING THIS INTO KOFTA,

40:17.992 --> 40:19.468
EVEN BEFORE YOU START
TURNING THIS INTO KOFTA,

40:19.468 --> 40:20.636
YOU'RE SCREWED.

40:20.636 --> 40:22.138
ONE MORE THING.

40:22.138 --> 40:23.514
WHAT'S THIS HERE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

40:23.514 --> 40:25.224
I'M DEFROSTING SOME CHICKEN.

40:25.224 --> 40:26.600
AND WHY ARE YOU
DEFROSTING THAT?

40:26.600 --> 40:28.436
I MARINATE IT YESTERDAY,

40:28.436 --> 40:30.146
AND I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE
IN THE FRIDGE,

40:30.146 --> 40:32.440
SO I PUT
INSIDE THE FREEZER.

40:32.440 --> 40:35.317
I DISAGREE ABOUT THE MEAT.

40:35.317 --> 40:38.696
FREEZING THE FOOD,
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT GO BAD.

40:38.696 --> 40:41.615
I REALLY DON'T GET
WHAT HE'S SAYING 100%.

40:41.615 --> 40:44.493
SOME OF THOSE CUSTOMERS TONIGHT,
THE FOOD THAT CAME BACK,

40:44.493 --> 40:46.245
WERE THE CUSTOMERS RIGHT,
OR WERE THEY WRONG?

40:46.245 --> 40:47.992
I NEVER, SINCE I OPEN,

40:47.992 --> 40:48.372
I NEVER, SINCE I OPEN,

40:48.372 --> 40:50.499
HAVE THAT MUCH FOOD
COME BACK, NEVER.

40:50.499 --> 40:53.085
<i>I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND</i>
<i>HOW FAR YOU'VE SLIPPED.</i>

40:53.085 --> 40:54.420
GET REAL.

40:54.420 --> 40:56.255
I AM.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

40:56.255 --> 41:01.010
WHY AREN'T YOUR CUSTOMERS COMING
BACK TO YOUR RESTAURANT, FAY?

41:01.010 --> 41:02.511
I DON'T KNOW.

41:02.511 --> 41:05.431
THEY LOVED MY FOOD.
THEY LOVED MY SMILE.

41:05.431 --> 41:07.558
<i>YOU'RE NOT BEING HONEST.</i>

41:07.558 --> 41:08.851
<i>YOU'RE NOT BEING HONEST</i>
<i>WITH YOURSELF,</i>

41:08.851 --> 41:10.186
AND YOU'RE NOT BEING HONEST
WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS.

41:10.186 --> 41:14.398
NO, I'M BEING HONEST.

41:14.398 --> 41:17.735
<i>YOUR CUSTOMERS WERE COMPLAINING</i>
<i>ABOUT THE HUMMUS, THE DIPS.</i>

41:17.735 --> 41:17.992
THEY WEREN'T VERY EXCITED.
SO I WENT AND MADE SOME.

41:17.992 --> 41:20.863
THEY WEREN'T VERY EXCITED.
SO I WENT AND MADE SOME.

41:20.863 --> 41:23.282
STAY THERE.

41:30.998 --> 41:32.666
HOW IS THAT?

41:32.666 --> 41:34.084
IT'S DELICIOUS HUMMUS.

41:34.084 --> 41:35.211
CAN YOU TASTE
THE DIFFERENCE?

41:35.211 --> 41:37.296
YES.

41:37.296 --> 41:39.715
NOW I HAVE A CONFESSION
TO MAKE.

41:39.715 --> 41:44.303
I ACTUALLY WALKED TO A STORE
AND BOUGHT IT.

41:46.889 --> 41:47.992
YOU NEED TO BE TEN TIMES BETTER
THAN STORE-BOUGHT HUMMUS.

41:47.992 --> 41:50.935
YOU NEED TO BE TEN TIMES BETTER
THAN STORE-BOUGHT HUMMUS.

41:50.935 --> 41:53.354
OTHERWISE, WHAT'S THE POINT
OF RUNNING A RESTAURANT?

41:53.354 --> 41:57.274
TONIGHT WAS A SHOCK TO ME.
LIKE, WOW.

41:57.274 --> 42:00.152
WHY EVERYTHING
IS COMING BACK?

42:00.152 --> 42:02.655
THERE ARE CERTAIN PLATES
I'M VERY PROUD OF,

42:02.655 --> 42:04.406
AND IT CAME BACK.

42:04.406 --> 42:07.785
BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

42:07.785 --> 42:09.286
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS SO WRONG.

42:09.286 --> 42:10.621
<i>AND UNFORTUNATELY,</i>

42:10.621 --> 42:12.665
<i>BECAUSE YOU ARE SURROUNDED</i>
<i>BY FAMILY MEMBERS,</i>

42:12.665 --> 42:15.125
YOU'VE CONVINCED YOURSELF
AND THEM

42:15.125 --> 42:17.002
THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS RIGHT.

42:17.002 --> 42:17.992
WELL, I'M SORRY.
FLAMING GRILL, IT'S NOT.

42:17.992 --> 42:20.130
WELL, I'M SORRY.
FLAMING GRILL, IT'S NOT.

42:20.130 --> 42:22.466
EXTINGUISH GRILL, IT IS.

42:22.466 --> 42:26.554
AND THE PROBLEMS, FAY,
ARE INSIDE.

42:26.554 --> 42:30.766
DO YOU WANT THIS BUSINESS
TO CONTINUE?

42:30.766 --> 42:35.145
I FEEL LIKE
I'M HANGING BY A THREAD.

42:43.779 --> 42:47.533
I'VE BEEN PRAYING AND SAYING
TOMORROW WILL BE A BETTER DAY.

42:50.494 --> 42:53.038
THAT BETTER DAY
IS NOT COMING.
