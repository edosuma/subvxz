WEBVTT

00:00.473 --> 00:01.807
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:03.376 --> 00:05.010
I see why you're on such
a hot streak.

00:05.078 --> 00:06.443
Hey, meet my jockey,

00:06.511 --> 00:08.079
<i>Janice Wayne.</i>

00:08.147 --> 00:10.081
Why would it shock you that
a woman could ride like that?

00:10.149 --> 00:11.515
The track seems like
such a boy's club.

00:11.583 --> 00:12.950
Well, you gain access
pretty quick

00:13.018 --> 00:14.451
when you start kickin'
all the boys' butts.

00:16.053 --> 00:18.656
Leave or I make you leave.

00:20.025 --> 00:21.425
<i>Stop it you two!</i>

00:22.960 --> 00:24.327
Oh, Caleb.

00:24.395 --> 00:26.196
You couldn't possibly
do anything

00:26.264 --> 00:28.398
to damage my relationship
with my daughter,

00:28.465 --> 00:29.833
except maybe give her a ring

00:29.901 --> 00:32.067
that probably came out
of a cracker Jack box.

00:32.136 --> 00:34.271
Has it turned green yet?

00:38.408 --> 00:40.075
Does this hurt?
Agh! Yes!

00:40.143 --> 00:41.677
The dude ranch
is important to me.

00:41.744 --> 00:42.878
More important
than your marriage?

00:42.946 --> 00:44.180
That is so unfair.

00:44.247 --> 00:45.247
I've got a meeting in Calgary.

00:45.315 --> 00:47.549
We'll talk later, all right?

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:07.402 --> 01:08.469
Dexter's looking great.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.673
Yeah!

01:13.741 --> 01:15.375
I guess that new exercise
rider's working out for ya?

01:15.443 --> 01:16.643
Oh yeah.

01:17.946 --> 01:18.645
As long as she doesn't
quit on me

01:18.713 --> 01:19.646
like the last one.

01:19.714 --> 01:20.881
Okay, Tim.

01:20.949 --> 01:22.115
You show me one other jockey
at this track

01:22.183 --> 01:24.218
that shows up at 5:00 AM.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.285
He still doesn't get
why I won't work

01:25.353 --> 01:26.652
as an exercise rider.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.688
Please, I get it.
Trust me, I get it.

01:29.756 --> 01:30.689
See you guys later.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.691
Okay.
See ya.

01:40.633 --> 01:42.033
Need a hand there, Lou?

01:42.101 --> 01:44.769
No thanks, grampa.
I got this guy.

01:44.837 --> 01:46.637
And Peter,
well, he's just like you;

01:46.705 --> 01:49.707
he's always gotta tack up
his own horse.

01:49.775 --> 01:51.743
Well, I see that.

01:52.678 --> 01:54.112
Hey.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.480
Hey, uh, listen,

01:55.547 --> 01:56.915
I just got off the phone
and I...

01:56.983 --> 01:58.548
You have a meeting.

01:58.616 --> 01:59.884
I do.

01:59.951 --> 02:02.419
Um, you know, three,
four hours, tops.

02:02.487 --> 02:05.522
Make that more of an all day
kind of thing?

02:05.590 --> 02:08.792
Yes, but tomorrow
I'm all yours.

02:08.860 --> 02:09.894
Okay, okay.

02:11.662 --> 02:12.796
Love you.
Love you.

02:15.132 --> 02:16.799
Don't you dare say anything,
grampa.

02:17.968 --> 02:19.602
All I was gonna say

02:19.669 --> 02:22.438
is it's a beautiful day
for a trail ride

02:22.506 --> 02:25.008
and would you like
some company?

02:25.075 --> 02:29.478
'Cause that poor guy
doesn't know what he's missing.

02:38.988 --> 02:41.556
It's your turn to pay
the phone bill.

02:41.624 --> 02:43.125
Okay.

02:43.192 --> 02:44.759
Hey, look at this.

02:44.827 --> 02:46.593
A pre-approved
credit card.

02:46.661 --> 02:49.196
Yeah,
with a $5000 dollar limit.

02:49.264 --> 02:51.198
We must be on
some kind of list.

02:51.266 --> 02:53.567
Yeah, the free money list.

02:53.635 --> 02:54.635
You're a valued customer.

02:54.702 --> 02:56.370
Don't be ridiculous.

02:56.438 --> 02:58.505
They just want us to spend
more money than we have

02:58.573 --> 03:01.042
and neither of us has any,
so...

03:01.109 --> 03:02.575
I'm gonna be late for work.

03:02.643 --> 03:03.810
Don't forget to pay
the phone bill.

03:03.877 --> 03:04.945
'Kay.

03:24.664 --> 03:25.730
Bingo.

03:27.733 --> 03:28.900
You look awesome out there.

03:28.969 --> 03:30.802
I know that horse.

03:30.870 --> 03:32.204
That's Lightning Dexter.

03:32.272 --> 03:35.373
My wife Lisa still goes on
and on and on

03:35.441 --> 03:38.076
about how you practically
stole him from her.

03:38.143 --> 03:38.909
Lisa?

03:38.978 --> 03:40.278
Stillman.

03:40.346 --> 03:43.214
Ex-wife.
I always forget the ex part.

03:44.149 --> 03:46.784
Dan Hartfield,
Brookland stables.

03:46.852 --> 03:47.818
Janice Wayne.

03:47.886 --> 03:49.887
Yeah, I know who you are.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.322
And I was a little
surprised to see

03:52.390 --> 03:53.556
that you're not
on the entry list

03:53.624 --> 03:54.791
for the handicap.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.659
Well, we're giving
Dexter a rest.

03:56.727 --> 03:57.861
We got a big series of races
coming up,

03:57.928 --> 03:59.529
so there you go.

03:59.597 --> 04:01.331
Okay.

04:01.399 --> 04:03.166
So that means
you're still available.

04:03.234 --> 04:04.468
I-

04:04.535 --> 04:07.336
Afraid not, no.
Exclusive to me, so...

04:07.404 --> 04:10.606
Oh, am I?
Good to know.

04:20.683 --> 04:22.250
Hey, I'm paying you
to ride that horse,

04:22.318 --> 04:23.651
not yack with the boys!

04:25.254 --> 04:27.122
He's paying you?

04:29.291 --> 04:30.892
First I've heard of it.

Yeah, but I gotta get better
than awesome.

05:20.373 --> 05:22.507
All right, well let's work on that.

05:26.878 --> 05:28.379
Look at that!

05:28.447 --> 05:30.147
Hello, global warming!

05:30.215 --> 05:32.849
What loser would drive
such a gas guzzler?

05:37.055 --> 05:38.722
Badger?
What?!

05:40.825 --> 05:43.059
Badger, where'd you get this?!

05:43.127 --> 05:44.760
Just bought it.

05:44.828 --> 05:46.563
Sweet ride, eh?

05:48.966 --> 05:50.100
What do you think?

05:50.167 --> 05:53.069
Still has the new car smell.

06:01.244 --> 06:03.412
Okay, just remember
your key words.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.813
Purge, position, pour.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.081
Right, it's all about the milk.

06:06.149 --> 06:07.216
You don't want it too foamy;

06:07.283 --> 06:09.151
you want it smooth,
rich and creamy.

06:09.219 --> 06:10.586
Oh my God, is that the time?

06:10.653 --> 06:12.921
Lou is gonna kill me.
Um, I need this to go.

06:12.989 --> 06:14.722
You know, now that you're
working at the dude ranch

06:14.789 --> 06:16.424
and I'm kind of in charge here,

06:16.492 --> 06:17.525
maybe you should
make me manager

06:17.593 --> 06:19.026
and give me a raise?

06:19.094 --> 06:20.128
How about we wait and see

06:20.195 --> 06:21.496
if you can convince
our customers

06:21.563 --> 06:23.431
to pay the big bucks
for a cup of coffee first?

06:23.499 --> 06:24.698
Well, that's not fair!

06:24.766 --> 06:26.934
What if Hudson's not
cappuccino ready?

06:27.002 --> 06:28.436
What if it's more
of a double-double

06:28.504 --> 06:29.703
kind of town?

06:32.072 --> 06:34.441
So, dad, you gonna
make it official

06:34.509 --> 06:37.177
and actually start paying me,
huh?

06:37.245 --> 06:38.578
Hmm, you know,

06:38.646 --> 06:39.812
I guess you're gettin'
pretty good.

06:39.880 --> 06:40.980
Pretty good?

06:41.048 --> 06:42.682
Well, for a rookie.
But you're so busy.

06:42.750 --> 06:43.816
You've got all these
things going on...

06:43.884 --> 06:45.118
the clinics...
I don't know.

06:45.186 --> 06:46.585
Yeah, but it's just a couple
hours in the morning.

06:46.653 --> 06:47.886
<i>I can fit it in.</i>

06:49.722 --> 06:50.989
Yeah, look, I just...

06:51.057 --> 06:52.291
I just don't want
to commit to something

06:52.359 --> 06:54.160
and then have you suddenly
change your mind

06:54.227 --> 06:55.294
and say that I'm...

06:55.362 --> 06:56.529
You know,
"I'm a professional jockey,

06:56.596 --> 06:58.264
I'm not an exercise rider."

06:58.331 --> 07:01.066
What are you talking about?

07:01.134 --> 07:02.467
That.

07:02.535 --> 07:03.668
<i>Janice?</i>

07:03.735 --> 07:05.170
Talking to Dan Hartfield.

07:05.237 --> 07:06.704
What, are we in like
high school here?

07:06.772 --> 07:07.705
You're jealous
your girlfriend's

07:07.773 --> 07:09.106
talking to another guy?

07:09.175 --> 07:13.110
No, my jockey is talking
to the competition.

07:13.179 --> 07:15.480
Dad, it's a small track
in a small town;

07:15.548 --> 07:16.681
people are gonna talk.

07:16.748 --> 07:18.915
Yeah, no, you're right.

07:18.983 --> 07:21.351
Oh, they're probably
just talking about...

07:21.419 --> 07:22.952
World peace.

07:33.764 --> 07:35.064
How's the ropin' going, Jake?

07:35.131 --> 07:37.400
Uh, not so good.

07:37.467 --> 07:41.437
Mallory took off on me
with Badger, in his car.

07:42.372 --> 07:43.673
Badger has a car?

07:43.740 --> 07:45.408
Yeah.

07:45.475 --> 07:47.577
What, now he's taking Mallory
off on a joy...

07:47.644 --> 07:49.278
Badger has a car?!

07:50.213 --> 07:53.248
Maybe they tried to get back,
but his car's pretty old.

07:53.316 --> 07:54.982
Maybe it broke down.

07:55.050 --> 07:56.585
Nice try, Jake,

07:56.652 --> 07:59.153
and I might believe you too...

08:00.122 --> 08:02.156
If I was born yesterday.

08:07.895 --> 08:09.630
Wow.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.866
Did they teach you to park
in driver's ed?

08:12.934 --> 08:16.103
Uh, I must have been
absent that day.

08:17.272 --> 08:19.406
Hey, Mallory, Badger,
check it out.

08:19.474 --> 08:21.308
Brand new espresso machine,

08:21.376 --> 08:25.010
and a brand new
specialty coffee menu.

08:25.078 --> 08:27.413
And brand new prices.

08:27.481 --> 08:29.148
Uh...

08:29.216 --> 08:30.950
Did I mention that
the first one's on the house?

08:31.017 --> 08:32.518
So you're just
giving them away?

08:32.586 --> 08:34.787
If you buy something to eat.

08:34.855 --> 08:37.690
Soraya's not here,
so I make the rules.

08:37.758 --> 08:40.292
Anyone want
a fresh-baked cookie?

08:40.360 --> 08:42.025
Uh, yeah,

08:42.094 --> 08:43.995
and a double espresso, please.

08:44.063 --> 08:46.465
And I'll have a Grande
skim milk, decaf, soya,

08:46.532 --> 08:48.133
banana moccachino, please.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.167
Yeah, don't push it.

08:50.235 --> 08:54.004
Two regular lattes
coming right up.

08:55.374 --> 08:56.641
So...

08:56.708 --> 08:58.643
You two on a date?

08:58.710 --> 09:01.245
Uh, kind of.
No.

09:01.313 --> 09:02.813
I guess so.

09:08.352 --> 09:09.619
Our guests expect

09:09.687 --> 09:11.354
an environmentally-friendly
experience, okay?

09:11.422 --> 09:13.055
So no matter what Lisa says,

09:13.123 --> 09:15.057
we are not replacing
the towels every day.

09:15.125 --> 09:16.526
It's re-fold
and re-fluff.

09:16.594 --> 09:18.561
Okay, got you.
So, when should I start?

09:18.629 --> 09:22.364
Is it so hard to rearrange the chairs?

09:22.432 --> 09:24.166
It's all about the feng shui.

09:24.233 --> 09:25.867
Gotcha, but really, Lou...

09:25.935 --> 09:27.369
Next, the outhouses.

09:27.437 --> 09:29.305
Okay, okay,
enough with the feng shui

09:29.372 --> 09:30.606
and the folding, Lou.

09:30.674 --> 09:32.641
You gave me a job,
when can I start doing it?

09:32.709 --> 09:33.776
Soon.

09:36.045 --> 09:37.712
I don't know, Soraya.
Look, I mean,

09:37.780 --> 09:39.914
Peter wants to go back asap,
obviously,

09:39.981 --> 09:41.248
not that I'm complaining.
I'm not.

09:41.317 --> 09:42.617
I mean, I'm married
to the most greatest,

09:42.685 --> 09:44.018
most understanding,

09:44.085 --> 09:45.252
most patient guy
in the world...

09:45.321 --> 09:47.422
Tomorrow.
I'll start tomorrow.

09:49.325 --> 09:50.658
Okay, okay.

09:51.560 --> 09:52.826
Thank you.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.160
Oh, just wait-
No, I'm good, thanks.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.162
Okay.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.968
<i>Hey, missy.</i>

10:02.036 --> 10:03.770
Oh, hey there, stranger.

10:03.838 --> 10:04.904
What's up?

10:06.441 --> 10:07.774
Missed you this morning.

10:07.842 --> 10:09.174
You've been spending
too much time

10:09.242 --> 10:10.543
with that new exercise rider.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.912
Well, I think she might be
a keeper.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.815
So, does that mean
you're not still mad at me

10:15.882 --> 10:17.850
for bailing out on you?

10:17.917 --> 10:20.052
I'm not mad at you.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.954
I should thank you for giving me
the opportunity

10:22.021 --> 10:23.989
to work with my daughter.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.757
Good.

10:26.559 --> 10:31.329
So, I saw you talking
to Dan Hartfield this morning.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.097
What did he do,
offer you a job?

10:33.165 --> 10:34.833
Uh, yeah,
matter of fact he did.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.235
I knew it, I knew it.

10:37.302 --> 10:38.436
That guy is a such an ass.

10:38.504 --> 10:40.238
And I took the job, Tim.

10:40.305 --> 10:41.238
I'll be riding
one of his horses

10:41.305 --> 10:42.973
in the handicap.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.908
You're gonna be riding
one of Dan Hartfield's horses?

10:44.976 --> 10:45.909
Yeah.

10:45.977 --> 10:47.177
Trick Tornado.

10:47.245 --> 10:48.879
You might want to check out
his stats.

10:48.946 --> 10:50.381
You should put
a couple of bucks on him.

10:50.448 --> 10:52.015
I don't get you.

10:52.083 --> 10:53.917
I mean, I thought that
we passed on that race.

10:53.985 --> 10:55.285
What if I entered Dexter?

10:55.353 --> 10:57.520
But you didn't, Tim,
and I need to make a living.

10:57.588 --> 10:58.588
I mean, just relax.

10:58.655 --> 10:59.989
I'm just riding
the guy's horse!

11:00.056 --> 11:02.224
That's exactly how it started
for you and me.

11:02.292 --> 11:03.693
Really?

11:03.761 --> 11:07.329
Janice, I just thought
we had something special.

11:09.433 --> 11:10.533
Okay, I get it,
you're a jockey.

11:10.601 --> 11:11.801
I know you gotta do
what you gotta do,

11:11.869 --> 11:13.101
but I just thought...

11:13.168 --> 11:14.770
I'd hoped things
might've changed.

11:14.837 --> 11:16.337
They did, Tim.

11:16.406 --> 11:18.273
Have you forgotten that
I moved out here to be with you?

11:18.340 --> 11:20.275
For how long?
Until you get a better offer?

11:20.342 --> 11:22.577
That's not fair.
You're crossing the line, Tim.

11:22.645 --> 11:24.078
No, I disagree.

11:24.146 --> 11:25.213
I think you're the one
who stepped over the line

11:25.281 --> 11:26.281
when you went behind my back

11:26.348 --> 11:28.883
and signed with Dan Hartfield.

11:40.762 --> 11:42.863
Get out of the car.

11:45.365 --> 11:47.667
Okay, Jack,

11:47.735 --> 11:50.002
before you go
all tough love on me,

11:50.070 --> 11:51.137
I can explain.

11:51.204 --> 11:52.705
No, you can't.

11:53.641 --> 11:54.707
I pay you to work,

11:54.775 --> 11:57.343
not to take road trips
on my dime.

11:57.411 --> 11:58.978
Yeah, your dime's about
what I make around here.

12:02.014 --> 12:04.483
You're lucky
I didn't hear that.

12:04.551 --> 12:06.117
You let me down.

12:07.053 --> 12:08.787
Both of you.

12:08.855 --> 12:10.322
And Mallory,
worse than letting me down,

12:10.389 --> 12:11.557
you let your parents down

12:11.624 --> 12:12.791
because I'm pretty sure

12:12.859 --> 12:14.292
you didn't bother
to ask permission

12:14.360 --> 12:15.594
before climbing into a car

12:15.662 --> 12:18.195
with a teenage boy
at the wheel!

12:18.263 --> 12:20.598
You're not gonna tell them
though, right, Jack?

12:20.666 --> 12:25.603
I'm not gonna lie for you,
that is for damn sure.

12:25.671 --> 12:27.404
What I am gonna do

12:28.340 --> 12:31.375
is I'm gonna make a new rule.

12:31.443 --> 12:32.509
While you work for me,

12:32.577 --> 12:34.978
you do not go outside
this fence line

12:35.045 --> 12:37.013
until quittin' time.
Is that understood?

12:37.081 --> 12:39.483
That starts right now.

12:42.687 --> 12:44.554
So um...

12:44.622 --> 12:46.222
Everyone, there's something
that I thought

12:46.290 --> 12:48.358
I'd run by all of you

12:48.425 --> 12:51.293
because you're gonna weigh in
on it anyway.

12:51.361 --> 12:53.562
Amy, how do you feel about
riding for me?

12:53.630 --> 12:55.130
Doesn't she already ride
for you?

12:55.198 --> 12:56.765
Yeah, she does
and she's doing a good job,

12:56.833 --> 12:58.066
but this is different.

12:58.134 --> 13:00.369
This is about the upcoming race,
the handicap.

13:00.436 --> 13:01.770
I entered Dexter.

13:01.838 --> 13:02.872
What does that have
to do with me?

13:02.939 --> 13:04.206
Well, the thing is,

13:04.273 --> 13:06.541
Janice is riding
for Dan Hartfield.

13:06.609 --> 13:08.543
Lisa's ex, Dan Hartfield?

13:08.611 --> 13:11.779
Yup, not my favourite guy
either, Jack.

13:11.847 --> 13:14.582
I need a jockey.

13:14.650 --> 13:16.818
I'm friends with the steward,
I know he's seen you ride,

13:16.886 --> 13:18.419
I know he's seen you
do the gate test

13:18.487 --> 13:20.087
and I don't think
there's gonna be a problem.

13:20.155 --> 13:22.322
You want Amy to be your jockey?
That's amazing!

13:22.390 --> 13:24.090
I don't know.

13:24.158 --> 13:26.793
Pretty big step up
from exercise girl.

13:26.861 --> 13:28.829
Aw, come on,
you know Amy can handle it.

13:28.897 --> 13:30.631
<i>And get to wear one of those</i>
<i>cute little jockey outfits.</i>

13:30.698 --> 13:32.032
Like I said,

13:32.099 --> 13:33.199
everyone was gonna
have an opinion.

13:34.502 --> 13:36.403
So, would you think about it,
honey?

13:36.470 --> 13:37.970
Dad, I don't need
to think about it.

13:38.038 --> 13:39.572
This is amazing!
Thank you so much!

13:39.640 --> 13:41.140
Okay, that's what I wanted to hear.

13:42.743 --> 13:45.511
- No, honestly.
- Okay, don't worry, Jack.

13:45.579 --> 13:47.246
Jack, don't worry.

13:48.214 --> 13:50.750
Okay, we don't wanna burn him out

13:50.817 --> 13:52.018
before race day,

13:52.085 --> 13:54.586
so just give him
an easy breeze, okay?

13:54.654 --> 13:56.454
That's the plan.

13:56.522 --> 14:00.291
Oh damn, there's Janice
and that creep Hartfield.

14:00.359 --> 14:03.028
Okay, don't let them
get to you.

14:03.095 --> 14:04.963
Okay, don't worry about it.

14:05.031 --> 14:06.031
You know what?

14:06.098 --> 14:07.265
Let's just show 'em
what we got.

14:07.332 --> 14:08.399
Just... just break out
of the gate fast

14:08.467 --> 14:11.001
and blow him a fast quarter,
okay?

14:11.069 --> 14:12.335
Okay.

14:12.403 --> 14:13.270
But, you know,
it's just like yesterday.

14:13.337 --> 14:15.005
It's just...

14:15.073 --> 14:17.041
Just take it easy, you know.

14:17.108 --> 14:18.408
Okay, I got it, dad.

14:20.078 --> 14:23.146
Just like the day before.
Don't get worked up.

14:48.605 --> 14:50.171
Hey! No! No! Hey!

14:52.842 --> 14:55.077
Whoa, what the hell
are you doin'?

15:01.216 --> 15:05.653
I guess that's what happens
when you hire your kids.

15:10.965 --> 15:13.601
<i>Cabin one ordered</i>
<i>two executive continentals,</i>

15:13.669 --> 15:14.935
but the guy in cabin three

15:15.003 --> 15:17.205
wants something called
the cowboy continental.

15:17.272 --> 15:20.274
The newest addition
to our menu...

15:20.342 --> 15:21.975
Buffalo jerky.

15:24.279 --> 15:25.612
Oh, give me a break, Lou!

15:25.680 --> 15:27.414
I have made a couple
of breakfasts in my life!

15:27.481 --> 15:29.882
This is not just any breakfast,
Soraya.

15:29.950 --> 15:31.585
This is our signature meal.

15:35.356 --> 15:37.156
Hi, honey.

15:38.058 --> 15:39.826
Really? Again?

15:41.528 --> 15:43.862
No, don't be silly.
I'll...

15:43.930 --> 15:45.698
I'll see you when I see you.

15:45.765 --> 15:48.267
Okay, bye.

15:49.202 --> 15:51.437
Damn, damn, damn!

15:51.504 --> 15:52.605
What happened to,
"I'm married to

15:52.672 --> 15:54.139
the most greatest guy
in the world"?

15:54.207 --> 15:55.474
Nothing, except that was

15:55.542 --> 15:57.175
one of the longest
conversations we've had

15:57.243 --> 15:58.809
since he got here

15:58.877 --> 16:00.645
and we have a lot
to talk about.

16:00.713 --> 16:02.012
Well, why don't you guys
go away,

16:02.080 --> 16:03.013
you know, to some nice hotel,

16:03.081 --> 16:04.081
just you and Peter.

16:04.149 --> 16:05.316
And his cell phone?

16:05.384 --> 16:07.719
Okay, um, camping.

16:07.786 --> 16:09.987
No clients, no meetings,
no connectivity.

16:10.055 --> 16:11.155
Sounds great,

16:11.223 --> 16:12.357
but I have a dude ranch to run.

16:12.424 --> 16:14.458
No, you don't, Lou.
You hired me to run it

16:14.525 --> 16:16.293
and right now
I've got a grand total

16:16.361 --> 16:18.595
of three guests
and three cabins

16:18.663 --> 16:21.197
and I think I can handle it.

16:21.266 --> 16:24.534
Oh my God,
this is like eating leather!

16:24.602 --> 16:25.902
Cowboy continental -
history.

16:25.970 --> 16:27.904
I will cross it off the menu.

16:27.972 --> 16:31.039
I think I dislocated my jaw.

16:39.516 --> 16:41.183
Badger, where'd you learn
to park?

16:41.251 --> 16:43.753
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
blah, blah, blah.

16:43.820 --> 16:46.187
Come on, man,
your car's blocking my truck.

16:47.122 --> 16:49.190
All right, I'm on it.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.358
Hurry up.

17:02.904 --> 17:04.938
Lose your keys?

17:05.006 --> 17:08.241
Uh, there never were any keys.

17:11.613 --> 17:14.247
So where'd you get a car
with no keys?

17:14.316 --> 17:15.982
Uh, a friend.

17:16.917 --> 17:19.719
Yeah, I, uh, bought it
from a friend.

17:20.654 --> 17:22.887
This friend got a name?

17:22.955 --> 17:24.757
Yeah. Johnny.

17:28.862 --> 17:30.563
Johnny. Johnny, Johnny.

17:35.668 --> 17:38.903
Johnny a nickname
for Bonita DiSalvio?

17:41.106 --> 17:43.342
It's a stolen car, dude.

17:43.409 --> 17:44.843
Your friend Johnny left
the owner's registration

17:44.910 --> 17:46.311
in the glove compartment.

17:46.379 --> 17:47.546
Look, man, I just bought it
from the guy.

17:47.613 --> 17:49.513
I didn't know it was stolen.

17:49.581 --> 17:50.781
Come on, man.

17:50.849 --> 17:52.717
You're doing good here,
don't screw this up.

17:52.784 --> 17:55.018
I swear I didn't know, okay?

17:55.086 --> 17:57.120
Whatever you do,
don't tell Clint about this.

17:57.188 --> 17:58.756
Forget Clint.

17:58.824 --> 18:01.525
It's Jack I'd be worried about.

18:03.228 --> 18:04.228
Listen,

18:04.295 --> 18:06.262
how about I do you a favour?

18:07.197 --> 18:09.098
Yeah, that'd be great.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.901
I won't tell anybody
if you ditch this car.

18:11.969 --> 18:13.236
Ditch my car?

18:13.303 --> 18:15.538
It's not your car,
it's Bonita DiSalvio's car.

18:15.606 --> 18:16.806
But I paid good money
for this car.

18:16.874 --> 18:18.107
Ditch the car.

18:18.175 --> 18:20.009
The cops'll find it,
they'll run the plates,

18:20.077 --> 18:22.277
Bonita gets her car back,

18:22.345 --> 18:24.980
nobody goes to prison,
all right?

18:25.047 --> 18:26.114
Everybody's happy.

18:26.182 --> 18:28.917
Yeah, everybody except me.

18:30.953 --> 18:33.054
Okay, sounds good.

18:37.860 --> 18:38.760
Good boy.

18:41.196 --> 18:42.229
Come on.

18:45.967 --> 18:47.435
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:47.503 --> 18:50.371
Looks like you had some
trouble out there today.

18:50.439 --> 18:51.606
Yeah.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.774
I don't really know
what I did wrong.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.776
That used to happen to me
when I was starting out.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.010
The horse outbreaks the rider,

18:57.077 --> 18:58.244
you fall back,
pull on his mouth,

18:58.312 --> 19:00.213
throw him off balance.

19:00.281 --> 19:02.181
I guess that's what happened.

19:02.249 --> 19:03.983
So what do I do about it?

19:04.051 --> 19:08.087
Well, you know how to ride,
the horse knows how to run,

19:08.155 --> 19:12.658
but I think I might be able
to help you out.

19:12.726 --> 19:13.793
Girl jockeys...

19:13.860 --> 19:14.894
not enough of us out there;

19:14.961 --> 19:16.495
we gotta stick together, right?

19:16.563 --> 19:17.663
Come on.

19:22.201 --> 19:23.869
This is a good spot.

19:23.937 --> 19:27.739
The police station's
right around the corner.

19:36.248 --> 19:37.882
I feel bad for that poor car.

19:37.950 --> 19:42.352
Yeah, don't worry.
It's going to a better place.

19:42.420 --> 19:44.187
<i>Come on, Badger.</i>

19:47.291 --> 19:48.625
Nice park job.

19:48.693 --> 19:49.726
Thanks.

19:58.669 --> 20:00.302
Let's go! Come on!

20:06.877 --> 20:08.177
All right.

20:08.879 --> 20:12.582
So, what do you think
of jockey boot camp so far?

20:12.649 --> 20:13.949
You do this every day?

20:14.016 --> 20:15.316
Yup.

20:15.384 --> 20:19.153
What's your regular
workout schedule like?

20:19.221 --> 20:20.589
I guess I don't really have one.

20:20.656 --> 20:23.191
Well, that was your problem
right there.

20:23.258 --> 20:26.127
Ah, time's up.
Let's go! Come on!

20:26.195 --> 20:27.662
Let's go.

20:48.682 --> 20:49.749
Damn kid.

20:57.558 --> 21:00.026
Hey... hey, boy!

21:00.093 --> 21:01.827
Hey, good boy.
Hey, buddy.

21:10.336 --> 21:11.970
Ooh! Nice.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.039
<i>Hey, can you give me a hand with this?</i>

21:14.106 --> 21:15.641
It weighs a ton!

21:15.708 --> 21:16.775
Sure.

21:17.709 --> 21:18.776
Um...

21:20.311 --> 21:23.014
Hmm... a backpack
and a cooler,

21:23.081 --> 21:25.516
weird kind of tilley endurables
vibe here.

21:25.584 --> 21:26.784
I've got the feeling
that me and this beer

21:26.852 --> 21:28.185
are not destined
to be together.

21:28.253 --> 21:30.922
Well, you can take it with you.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.791
And where are my beer
and me going?

21:34.859 --> 21:36.092
Camping.

21:50.406 --> 21:51.373
Yeah, good boy.

21:51.441 --> 21:52.575
<i>Oh my God.</i>

21:58.014 --> 21:58.981
Quick, quick, quick! Turn on the heat!

21:59.049 --> 22:00.182
Woo!

22:02.285 --> 22:03.786
<i>You sure you want to bail</i>
<i>on the great outdoors, Lou?</i>

22:03.853 --> 22:05.087
I mean, you know what they say
about the weather, right?

22:05.154 --> 22:06.420
Wait five minutes
and it'll change.

22:06.488 --> 22:07.421
Very funny.

22:08.791 --> 22:10.558
Oh look, honey, yup, it's...

22:10.626 --> 22:12.126
I think it's clearing up.

22:12.194 --> 22:14.295
Why does nothing ever work out!

22:14.362 --> 22:16.664
It's just a little rain.
Take it easy.

22:16.732 --> 22:18.600
You think this is about
the weather?

22:18.667 --> 22:19.867
This is about going somewhere,

22:19.935 --> 22:22.769
just me and you,
so that we can...

22:22.837 --> 22:24.404
Talk about stuff!

22:24.472 --> 22:26.873
We are going to.
Look.

22:26.941 --> 22:28.041
See?

22:28.109 --> 22:29.275
No reception at all.

22:29.343 --> 22:30.176
I can't even use
this thing, so...

22:32.213 --> 22:33.246
You know what?

22:33.314 --> 22:34.481
I was gonna wait

22:34.548 --> 22:35.649
for the right moment
to do this,

22:35.717 --> 22:37.217
but maybe... maybe this
is the right moment.

22:37.284 --> 22:38.283
What's right about it?

22:38.351 --> 22:40.019
Just hold on.

22:42.089 --> 22:44.056
What are you doing?

22:44.124 --> 22:46.025
Just keep still.

22:47.127 --> 22:48.661
Oh my God!

22:49.562 --> 22:52.898
Yeah, it's just something
I picked up at a garage sale,

22:52.966 --> 22:54.465
remind you of how much
I love you.

22:54.533 --> 22:56.134
Oh my God!

22:56.201 --> 22:57.268
Baby.

23:00.773 --> 23:01.973
Hey, listen,

23:02.041 --> 23:04.509
the rain's letting up a little.

23:04.576 --> 23:06.911
Maybe we can get that tent
back up in no time and...

23:10.214 --> 23:11.248
<i>Max!</i>

23:14.585 --> 23:15.519
You know what? I'm sick of nature.

23:15.586 --> 23:16.854
Let's get a room.

23:16.921 --> 23:17.988
Hey.

23:18.056 --> 23:19.489
I know the perfect place.

23:22.861 --> 23:25.029
You know, I thought
show jumping was exciting,

23:25.096 --> 23:27.463
but going top speed
full out on Dexter,

23:27.531 --> 23:29.532
it's just...
Once he reaches his stride,

23:29.599 --> 23:31.600
his speed, the power,
it's amazing!

23:31.669 --> 23:33.136
Ah, yeah!

23:33.203 --> 23:35.038
Yeah, there's a knot there.

23:35.105 --> 23:36.039
Ow.
You all right?

23:36.106 --> 23:37.740
Yeah.

23:37.808 --> 23:40.376
You know, I think Janice
is trying to kill me.

23:40.443 --> 23:42.044
Really, I mean...

23:42.111 --> 23:44.012
It's one thing to exercise
a few horses in the morning,

23:44.080 --> 23:45.947
but she's hard core.

23:46.015 --> 23:47.448
Yeah, well, they all are.

23:47.516 --> 23:49.517
I've seen the way
jockeys work out.

23:49.585 --> 23:51.519
Great.
Thanks for warning me.

23:51.587 --> 23:53.555
You wouldn't have listened
if I did warn you.

23:55.892 --> 23:57.292
Uh...

23:57.359 --> 23:58.392
Sorry.

23:58.459 --> 24:01.395
It's okay.
It does feel good.

24:01.462 --> 24:02.863
That's good.

24:02.931 --> 24:04.165
How does this feel?

24:06.168 --> 24:07.101
Okay, that tickles.

24:07.169 --> 24:08.202
Ow, Ty!

24:08.269 --> 24:09.469
Ty, it hurts to laugh!

24:09.537 --> 24:10.805
Oh, it hurts to laugh.

24:10.872 --> 24:11.672
Does this hurt right there?

24:11.740 --> 24:12.807
Yes!

24:21.215 --> 24:23.049
Come on, forget the luggage.
Let's go!

24:23.117 --> 24:25.018
Come on, buddy.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.687
Come on.
Let's go.

24:29.323 --> 24:32.490
Ah, damn it. It's one of these keys.

24:32.558 --> 24:35.660
Come on, buddy.

24:35.729 --> 24:39.131
Oh, here we go.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.266
Ah!

24:41.334 --> 24:42.367
All right.

24:43.737 --> 24:45.270
<i>Oh my God!</i>

24:45.338 --> 24:46.570
<i>- What the hell?!</i>
<i>- I'm so sorry!</i>

24:46.638 --> 24:47.671
<i>Get your dog off me!</i>

24:47.740 --> 24:49.340
<i>Get out of here!</i>

24:49.407 --> 24:50.641
<i>I know he really stinks</i>
<i>when he's wet.</i>

24:50.709 --> 24:51.809
<i>He's- he's friendly.</i>
<i>Sorry!</i>

24:51.877 --> 24:53.778
Sorry! I'm so sorry about that!

24:53.846 --> 24:55.512
Oh, and as for the cabin,
there'll be no charge.

24:55.580 --> 24:57.314
<i>There better not be!</i>

24:57.382 --> 24:58.116
<i>I can't believe this!</i>

25:03.517 --> 25:05.051
<i>Okay.</i>

25:05.119 --> 25:06.819
Morning, Lou. What happened to camping?

25:06.887 --> 25:10.390
Uh, what happened to cabin
number two being empty?

25:10.457 --> 25:12.591
Well, I used my contacts,

25:12.659 --> 25:14.159
made a deal with the hotels
in the area

25:14.227 --> 25:15.794
to pick up their overflow.

25:15.861 --> 25:17.062
Overflow.

25:17.130 --> 25:19.464
The guests in cabin two
are overflow?

25:19.532 --> 25:21.533
That plate has too much
fruit on it.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.135
Cabin two.
I figured I'd,

25:23.202 --> 25:24.669
you know, add something extra.

25:24.737 --> 25:26.238
They had a bit
of a rough night.

25:26.306 --> 25:29.408
Something to do with a wet dog?

25:36.514 --> 25:38.416
What's it doing here?!

25:38.483 --> 25:40.384
I, I don't know.

25:42.054 --> 25:43.321
Maybe it's like the cat.

25:43.388 --> 25:45.456
You know, the cat
that kept coming back?

25:45.523 --> 25:46.990
Okay,
but how the hell did it...?

25:47.058 --> 25:49.993
<i>Well, I towed it from town.</i>

25:50.061 --> 25:51.261
And believe me,

25:51.329 --> 25:54.297
that wasn't something
on my to-do list.

25:54.365 --> 25:56.099
So here's my question:

25:56.167 --> 25:58.468
What the hell was your car
doing in town

25:58.535 --> 25:59.902
after I grounded
the both of you?

26:01.638 --> 26:02.938
Well, Jack, look.
When I got it,

26:03.006 --> 26:03.905
I didn't know that it was...

26:03.974 --> 26:05.441
Didn't know what?

26:06.977 --> 26:08.143
Nothing.

26:08.211 --> 26:09.611
Well, damn right nothing.

26:11.314 --> 26:13.315
So, from now on,

26:13.383 --> 26:16.485
this car does not leave
the property

26:16.552 --> 26:18.686
and neither do you,

26:20.022 --> 26:21.189
ever,

26:21.256 --> 26:23.291
or your summer is over.

26:23.359 --> 26:25.493
What about Saturday?
Amy's race?

26:25.560 --> 26:28.096
Well, you'll be mucking out
the barn, both of ya.

26:28.163 --> 26:30.064
So find a radio
if you want to listen to it.

26:36.037 --> 26:38.338
Now remember, on race day,
it's all about preparation.

26:38.406 --> 26:40.374
Gotta make sure
that you give Dexter

26:40.441 --> 26:42.075
a proper warm-up
without a lead pony.

26:42.143 --> 26:43.910
You told me.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.078
It's twelve furlongs,
so you can't give him his head

26:45.146 --> 26:46.313
until you come around
the last turn.

26:46.381 --> 26:48.115
I know.

26:48.182 --> 26:49.516
Oh yeah?
Well, if you know so much,

26:49.583 --> 26:51.350
then you know to watch out
for the girl

26:51.418 --> 26:53.452
riding for Dan Hartfield.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.686
If she gets a chance,

26:54.754 --> 26:56.622
she's gonna box you
into that rail

26:56.689 --> 26:59.392
and you're never gonna get out.

26:59.459 --> 27:01.593
Okay, I got it.

27:09.801 --> 27:12.370
So what's the deal
with you and my dad?

27:12.438 --> 27:13.838
What deal?

27:15.107 --> 27:16.574
I don't know.

27:16.642 --> 27:17.708
You two just seemed
kind of cold

27:17.776 --> 27:19.810
all of a sudden.

27:19.878 --> 27:21.079
Yeah.

27:21.147 --> 27:23.747
I guess things
have been better.

27:23.814 --> 27:25.049
Your dad's a great guy, Amy,

27:25.116 --> 27:27.451
but I didn't come up here
to end my career.

27:27.519 --> 27:28.718
If you want to make a living
as a jockey,

27:28.786 --> 27:29.986
you gotta ride
for different stables;

27:30.055 --> 27:31.821
go where the winning
horses are, you know?

27:31.889 --> 27:33.823
Yeah, I get that.

27:34.759 --> 27:37.461
Okay, so one more thing to get:

27:37.529 --> 27:39.595
When you're out there,
there's a lot of distractions,

27:39.663 --> 27:41.230
so you want to keep focused
on your goal.

27:41.298 --> 27:43.799
Okay, so you mean to win?

27:43.867 --> 27:46.001
Your first race?

27:46.070 --> 27:47.970
Jeez, you sound exactly
like your dad.

27:48.038 --> 27:49.272
You're not gonna win, honey.

27:49.339 --> 27:50.873
You'll be lucky
if you finish in the money.

27:50.941 --> 27:52.075
But listen,

27:52.142 --> 27:53.409
your goal is the same as mine,

27:53.477 --> 27:55.410
the same as every other
jockey out there:

27:55.478 --> 27:58.246
Get your horse across
the finish line in one piece.

27:58.314 --> 27:59.481
Okay?

27:59.549 --> 28:00.882
Okay.
Good.

28:00.950 --> 28:04.052
All right, break's over. Let's go!

28:04.120 --> 28:05.153
<i>Come on!</i>

28:07.990 --> 28:10.791
Jack towed it all the way from town?

28:10.858 --> 28:12.293
So what's the big deal?

28:12.360 --> 28:13.994
All you gotta do
is take it back.

28:14.062 --> 28:15.862
No, Jack said he'd fire me
if I went anywhere.

28:15.930 --> 28:17.264
Well, if he finds out it's stolen,

28:17.332 --> 28:18.432
he's gonna do a lot worse,
now isn't he?

28:18.500 --> 28:20.201
He's being really unreasonable.

28:20.268 --> 28:23.036
He's not even letting us
go watch Amy ride Dexter.

28:23.105 --> 28:25.739
The race.

28:25.807 --> 28:26.839
When Jack's at the track,

28:26.907 --> 28:27.873
you'll have more
than enough time

28:27.941 --> 28:28.808
to dump the car and get back

28:28.875 --> 28:31.411
before he does, okay?

28:31.479 --> 28:32.512
All right.

28:33.547 --> 28:34.880
Mmm.

28:34.948 --> 28:36.382
How much do I owe you
for the latte?

28:36.450 --> 28:37.617
First one's on the house.

28:37.684 --> 28:39.051
Well, thank you.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.886
And don't forget to tell Amy
I'll be rootin' for her.

28:40.954 --> 28:42.187
Oh, what,
you're not coming to the race?

28:42.255 --> 28:46.525
I have to work this weekend.
I need the hours.

28:46.593 --> 28:49.728
Oh my God!
I love your tennis bracelet!

28:49.795 --> 28:52.431
Thank you.
Peter got it for me.

28:52.499 --> 28:54.566
Nothing says "I love you"
like diamonds.

28:54.634 --> 28:56.868
Well, that's not totally true.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.869
Caleb got me this
when we got married

28:58.937 --> 29:00.738
and even though
it turns my finger green,

29:00.805 --> 29:02.540
I know he loves me.

29:02.608 --> 29:04.275
<i>Right, sweetie?</i>

29:05.244 --> 29:05.976
Sweetie?

29:06.044 --> 29:07.911
Hmm?

29:07.979 --> 29:09.780
I'm still here, aren't I?

29:14.685 --> 29:16.486
Ah.

29:16.554 --> 29:18.021
Hey, I'm telling you,

29:18.088 --> 29:20.423
you have improved 100 percent.

29:21.626 --> 29:23.226
I do think I'm starting
to get it.

29:23.294 --> 29:24.794
You must be getting tired.

29:24.862 --> 29:26.429
A little.
I'm all right though.

29:26.497 --> 29:27.631
Well, we just gotta make sure

29:27.698 --> 29:28.431
that we give him
a good warm-up

29:28.499 --> 29:29.766
before the race.

29:29.833 --> 29:31.867
Yes, I know,
without a lead pony.

29:31.934 --> 29:33.035
Janice told me.

29:33.102 --> 29:34.470
What? Jan...

29:34.538 --> 29:35.937
You've been talking to Janice
about the race?

29:36.005 --> 29:37.640
Well, yeah,
we've been training together.

29:37.707 --> 29:38.874
She's actually been a big help.

29:38.941 --> 29:40.142
Janice has been a big help.

29:40.210 --> 29:41.477
Wow.

29:41.545 --> 29:43.179
You know, you're racing
against her, right?

29:43.246 --> 29:44.813
She's the most competitive
person in the world;

29:44.881 --> 29:47.515
that's what makes her
a good jockey.

29:47.583 --> 29:49.950
Well, until she walked
out on me.

29:50.018 --> 29:51.486
Dad, she just took another job.

29:51.554 --> 29:53.288
I know, okay?

29:53.355 --> 29:54.656
I'm gonna get
the last laugh anyway.

29:54.723 --> 29:56.090
I saw her training
with Hartfield's horse.

29:56.158 --> 29:58.293
She's got no feel for it.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.195
It's got cheap speed,
can't close,

30:00.262 --> 30:01.563
so there's nothing
getting between you

30:01.630 --> 30:03.129
and the finish line.

30:03.198 --> 30:04.464
Nothing.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.366
You know, it would be hard enough

30:06.434 --> 30:08.068
if it was just my first race,

30:08.135 --> 30:09.269
but dad seems to have forgotten

30:09.337 --> 30:10.970
that I've never done
this before.

30:11.038 --> 30:12.506
Come on, Amy,
help me out here.

30:12.574 --> 30:13.773
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

30:13.841 --> 30:15.909
You know,
he actually expects me to win,

30:15.976 --> 30:18.544
so I'm pretty much guaranteed
to disappoint him.

30:20.180 --> 30:21.980
Just focus on the race, Amy.

30:22.048 --> 30:23.982
Don't worry about
what your dad wants.

30:24.050 --> 30:25.918
You think I'm gonna lose.

30:25.985 --> 30:28.221
No, I think you're gonna win.

30:29.155 --> 30:30.656
Great. More pressure.

30:33.327 --> 30:37.229
Amy, you're doing something
that you've never done before.

30:37.296 --> 30:39.231
You've got your whole
family behind you;

30:39.298 --> 30:42.267
I'll be with you
every step of the way.

30:42.335 --> 30:43.702
To be a winner,

30:43.769 --> 30:45.169
you don't have to be the first
across the finish line.

30:50.609 --> 30:51.675
Come on.

30:52.677 --> 30:54.111
Give me hand.
There we go.

32:02.843 --> 32:03.976
<i>Lightning Dexter.</i>

32:06.780 --> 32:08.781
Hey, how's it going?

32:09.749 --> 32:11.650
It's good.

32:11.718 --> 32:12.785
Great.

32:13.720 --> 32:14.921
Okay.

32:14.988 --> 32:17.223
Race you to the other end?

32:18.324 --> 32:19.357
Yeah.

32:23.863 --> 32:25.330
<i>The track is fast</i>

32:39.344 --> 32:41.511
She's got a good start.

32:41.579 --> 32:43.314
<i>Boxie Fortune is in</i>

32:43.381 --> 32:44.781

32:49.887 --> 32:52.322
and it looks like Trick Tornado

32:52.389 --> 32:55.024
Trick Tornado is making a move

32:57.261 --> 32:59.662

33:01.431 --> 33:04.267

33:04.335 --> 33:06.368
Oh, she's got a chance.

33:06.435 --> 33:07.903
<i>With Trick Tornado...</i>

33:07.971 --> 33:09.804
Yeah, she's coming on now!

33:11.407 --> 33:13.075

33:36.731 --> 33:38.431

33:52.280 --> 33:54.113
Yes! Oh my God!

33:54.180 --> 33:55.414
Ow!

33:55.481 --> 33:56.916
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I forgot.

33:56.983 --> 33:59.118
<i>And Graham's Grace.</i>

33:59.185 --> 34:00.585
<i>What a race!</i>

34:00.653 --> 34:02.321
That's great, isn't it?
It's great, yeah.

34:02.389 --> 34:04.023
Great.

34:04.090 --> 34:05.257
<i>That was certainly</i>
<i>a memorable one.</i>

34:05.325 --> 34:07.192
<i>It was Trick Tornado to win...</i>

34:07.260 --> 34:09.261
Dad!

34:09.329 --> 34:12.563
<i>Boxie Fortune to place</i>
<i>and Lightning Dexter to show!</i>

34:16.293 --> 34:18.527
Whoa! All right!

34:19.463 --> 34:21.630
Yeah, congratulations!

34:21.699 --> 34:23.433
Thank you!

34:23.500 --> 34:25.534
I still can't believe it!

34:25.601 --> 34:26.902
You know what?
I asked him to go

34:26.969 --> 34:27.569
and it was like he had
a whole other gear!

34:27.637 --> 34:28.704
He just took off!

34:28.772 --> 34:30.139
You looked like a total pro
out there!

34:30.206 --> 34:31.273
You were great!

34:31.341 --> 34:32.108
Yeah, well, tell my dad that.

34:32.175 --> 34:33.809
He didn't seem too happy.

34:33.877 --> 34:35.244
Well, he should be happy.
It was your first race.

34:35.311 --> 34:36.178
What did he expect?

34:36.246 --> 34:38.513
He expected me to win.

34:39.415 --> 34:41.181
But you did so good!

34:41.250 --> 34:42.283
Ye y you did.

34:46.420 --> 34:47.455
Hey, Ty...

34:48.290 --> 34:49.224
What's wrong?

34:49.291 --> 34:50.391
Feel his leg.

34:57.598 --> 34:59.066
Well done.

35:01.903 --> 35:03.203
Hey, Tim.

35:03.271 --> 35:04.972
Your daughter rocked
out there today.

35:05.039 --> 35:06.173
Tell her I said so.

35:06.241 --> 35:08.242
Well, congratulations
to you too.

35:08.309 --> 35:09.777
Hey, what about me?

35:09.844 --> 35:11.944
I'm the guy whose name
is on the trophy!

35:17.918 --> 35:18.985
Cheers.

35:19.686 --> 35:20.920
Come here, you.

35:20.988 --> 35:23.689
Good work, good work.
Fantastic.

35:23.757 --> 35:25.357
You gotta be kidding me.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.760
<i>Oh yeah, there's...</i>

35:28.828 --> 35:31.462
There's heat
and there's swelling.

35:32.331 --> 35:33.698
Well, it's probably tendonitis.

35:33.766 --> 35:34.966
He's gonna need an ultrasound.

35:35.034 --> 35:36.268
Oh that's great.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.136
Dad, it's not a career ender,

35:38.204 --> 35:39.504
but tendons are tricky.

35:39.571 --> 35:40.672
He's gonna have to be
brought back slowly.

35:40.739 --> 35:43.474
How slowly?
What are you talking about?

35:43.542 --> 35:45.843
With Scott, I've seen
some horses take six weeks,

35:45.911 --> 35:47.077
others six months.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.312
It really depends on the horse.

35:48.379 --> 35:49.413
Yeah, thanks, doc,

35:49.480 --> 35:50.447
that really
narrows it down for me.

35:50.515 --> 35:52.149
Dad!

35:53.985 --> 35:56.120
This is a disaster.

35:58.423 --> 36:01.757
Wow, this machine might
actually pay for itself.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.327
Yeah, I knew it might take
a while for it to catch on,

36:04.394 --> 36:05.494
but when I started

36:05.562 --> 36:06.562
to give away those freebies...

36:06.630 --> 36:07.763
Freebies?

36:07.832 --> 36:10.200
A limited one-time-only
free trial offer.

36:10.267 --> 36:12.468
And don't you think we should
have discussed it first?

36:12.536 --> 36:14.103
I made a managerial decision

36:14.171 --> 36:17.372
and it think it worked out
pretty well.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.807
So...

36:18.875 --> 36:21.710
How about that promotion?

36:25.215 --> 36:26.514
Hey, babe, what's up?

36:27.483 --> 36:28.717
I'm the new manager!

36:28.784 --> 36:29.751
Congrats!

36:29.819 --> 36:30.886
Does the job come with a raise?

36:30.954 --> 36:32.553
Yup, but it doesn't kick in

36:32.620 --> 36:33.988
until we pay off
the coffee machine.

36:34.056 --> 36:38.559
Still, we ought to celebrate.

36:38.626 --> 36:40.694
Hey, my ring! What are you doing?!

36:40.762 --> 36:44.265
Like I said,
we are celebrating.

36:44.333 --> 36:46.133
A new band?

36:47.035 --> 36:48.335
And...

36:48.402 --> 36:49.736
What?

36:49.803 --> 36:51.171
They're nice rings, Caleb,

36:51.239 --> 36:53.806
but I kind of like
my cracker Jack box ring.

36:53.875 --> 36:56.676
Yeah, but...
It was kind of a joke.

36:56.744 --> 36:59.479
I don't want anybody thinking
our marriage is a joke.

36:59.546 --> 37:01.481
It's real, just like this ring.

37:03.217 --> 37:04.516
This is real?!

37:05.451 --> 37:07.219
It must have cost a fortune!
How did you...

37:07.287 --> 37:08.854
Don't ask.

37:08.922 --> 37:11.656
Oh no, not that credit card!

37:11.724 --> 37:13.759
You let me worry about it.

37:13.826 --> 37:16.028
Oh, Caleb, you're crazy!

37:16.096 --> 37:17.462
Yes I am.

37:33.578 --> 37:35.846
That's Badger's car!

37:37.516 --> 37:41.051
I told them that I'd fire them
if they left the property!

37:41.119 --> 37:42.586
And I told them
they had a limited window

37:42.654 --> 37:43.986
of opportunity.

37:45.790 --> 37:48.892
I'm guessing
there's a story here.

37:48.959 --> 37:51.093
Yeah, it's a short one.

37:51.161 --> 37:52.462
This car?

37:53.764 --> 37:54.997
It's stolen.

37:55.065 --> 37:56.065
Badger says he didn't know,

37:56.133 --> 37:57.366
but he should have
suspected it.

37:57.435 --> 37:58.701
Oh, that makes him an idiot.

37:58.769 --> 38:02.438
But not exactly
a hard-core criminal.

38:09.846 --> 38:10.913
Hey boy.

38:13.917 --> 38:15.083
Amy?

38:15.918 --> 38:18.152
What are you doing here, dad?

38:18.219 --> 38:19.286
Well, I tried to call you,

38:19.354 --> 38:22.490
but I guess you weren't
picking up.

38:24.993 --> 38:26.060
Honey.

38:29.865 --> 38:32.131
I just wanted to tell you
how proud I am of you,

38:32.199 --> 38:35.101
about the way you handled
yourself out there.

38:35.169 --> 38:36.636
That's nice, dad.

38:36.704 --> 38:40.974
And I know I overreacted
when the horse came up lame.

38:41.041 --> 38:43.409
You know, maybe if I hadn't
have been such a beginner

38:43.478 --> 38:45.044
and we didn't have to do
so many practice runs,

38:45.112 --> 38:46.746
then his tendons wouldn't
have been affected.

38:46.814 --> 38:48.481
No. No,
it's not your fault.

38:48.548 --> 38:49.615
I entered Dexter.

38:49.683 --> 38:52.952
Janice told me
he needed a rest.

38:53.854 --> 38:57.322
I guess when she bailed
on me, I just...

38:57.390 --> 38:59.057
I just stopped
thinking straight.

38:59.125 --> 39:02.995
So right about the time
you hired me to ride for you?

39:03.062 --> 39:06.197
Listen,
Dexter's gonna race again

39:06.264 --> 39:07.599
and I want you on him.

39:07.666 --> 39:09.100
Dad...

39:09.167 --> 39:10.869
Janice is a way better jockey
than I'll ever be.

39:10.936 --> 39:14.405
Well, Janice and I
are not exactly...

39:16.775 --> 39:20.176
I tried to call her.
She's not picking up, so...

39:20.244 --> 39:22.045
You tried to call me too,

39:22.113 --> 39:25.816
but when I didn't answer
you just showed up.

39:25.884 --> 39:28.284
Look where we are now.

39:42.623 --> 39:44.757
Oh, Tim.

39:44.825 --> 39:46.858
Yeah.

39:46.926 --> 39:47.859
You gonna invite me in or...?

39:47.927 --> 39:48.927
Nop..

39:48.995 --> 39:50.662
I'm actually
just on my way out.

39:50.730 --> 39:52.598
I've got a job up at Northlands
in Edmonton.

39:52.665 --> 39:54.666
I'm gonna be gone
for a couple of days.

39:54.734 --> 39:55.934
Northlands.

39:56.869 --> 39:58.937
They got a lot of nice horses
up there.

39:59.005 --> 40:00.138
Yup.

40:00.206 --> 40:03.173
Well, that's, that's great.

40:03.241 --> 40:04.909
Oh, now it's great?

40:04.977 --> 40:08.746
You went all insane before
about Dan Hartfield.

40:08.814 --> 40:11.582
Well, Dan Hartfield, please.

40:11.650 --> 40:12.850
Yeah.

40:12.918 --> 40:14.085
Every time I see
that smug smile

40:14.152 --> 40:15.620
I just want to smack it
off his face.

40:15.687 --> 40:19.155
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

40:21.092 --> 40:22.158
Well, I just dropped by
to tell you

40:22.226 --> 40:24.160
that I don't blame you
for anything.

40:24.228 --> 40:25.862
Whoa, blaming me?

40:25.930 --> 40:27.296
What are you saying?

40:27.364 --> 40:29.432
Your horse turned up lame
because mine won?

40:29.500 --> 40:32.268
No, I'm saying you won
because my horse was lame.

40:38.274 --> 40:39.374
This is how you make up
with a girl?

40:39.442 --> 40:41.543
I don't know.
I'm...

40:42.445 --> 40:43.846
Look, I'm better
at the breaking up part

40:43.913 --> 40:45.313
than I am at
the making up part,

40:45.381 --> 40:46.448
all right?
Obviously.

40:48.351 --> 40:52.020
So, come on,
you gonna let me in or...?

40:52.988 --> 40:54.055
Maybe.

40:55.924 --> 40:58.492
When I get back from Edmonton.

41:00.829 --> 41:01.863
Bye.

41:09.470 --> 41:10.537
Hey there, Jake.

41:10.604 --> 41:12.438
Haven't seen you around
much lately.

41:12.506 --> 41:14.407
Yeah, I've been busy
kind of studying.

41:14.475 --> 41:16.043
Well, don't bother
asking Mallory

41:16.110 --> 41:18.111
to drive the quad for you.

41:18.179 --> 41:21.281
She's not going anywhere
on anything with wheels.

41:21.348 --> 41:23.415
Well, that's what
I've been studying for.

41:23.483 --> 41:25.350
I got my learner's permit.

41:25.418 --> 41:27.452
Well, did you now?

41:28.421 --> 41:30.056
How's the driving going?

41:30.123 --> 41:32.591
I don't know.
Haven't done any yet.

41:32.659 --> 41:35.795
I can't find anyone to take me.

41:42.134 --> 41:43.467
Looks pretty good.

41:43.535 --> 41:46.705
Make it bit deeper
we should be all right.

41:46.772 --> 41:49.074
Oh great, there's Jack.
Look busy.

41:49.141 --> 41:51.209
Look busy? What are you talking about?

41:51.276 --> 41:52.343
I am busy!

41:56.781 --> 41:58.682
<i>That's not Jack.</i>

42:00.051 --> 42:01.952
Jake got his learners.

42:02.887 --> 42:05.155
Yeah, so what?
Any idiot can drive.

42:06.124 --> 42:08.092
Tell me about it.

42:13.097 --> 42:15.331
I guess we better start
thinking about heading back.

42:18.235 --> 42:19.836
You know...

42:19.903 --> 42:21.403
I'm not an idiot, Lou.

42:21.471 --> 42:23.940
I know that you hate Dubai.

42:24.875 --> 42:25.942
You do?

42:26.876 --> 42:28.744
Yeah.

42:29.979 --> 42:32.748
I thought I was doing
a pretty good job of hiding it.

42:32.815 --> 42:34.883
Well, not from me.

42:36.119 --> 42:37.919
Did you think I like it
any better than you do?

42:37.987 --> 42:39.387
I don't.

42:39.455 --> 42:42.457
But I don't have a choice;
I'm have to go back.

42:42.524 --> 42:45.292
So, what?
This was a bribe

42:45.360 --> 42:47.694
to get me back on
that plane or what?

42:47.763 --> 42:49.230
No, that was...

42:50.198 --> 42:51.198
So that you'll think of me

42:51.266 --> 42:54.168
while you're here
and I'm there.

42:54.236 --> 42:55.770
You're going without me?

42:57.906 --> 42:59.538
And you're okay with that?

42:59.606 --> 43:00.774
Yeah, I don't want
to be the guy

43:00.841 --> 43:02.876
who keeps taking you
away from your home.

43:05.980 --> 43:08.681
But my home
is wherever you are.

43:09.650 --> 43:10.950
Even Dubai?

43:11.919 --> 43:15.120
As long as that's
where you are.

43:17.423 --> 43:18.824
I mean it.

43:26.432 --> 43:29.401
You know, I've been wondering
about something.

43:29.468 --> 43:31.602
Yeah? Like what?

43:31.670 --> 43:32.970
Well...

43:33.038 --> 43:34.705
Remember when you said
it didn't matter

43:34.773 --> 43:35.706
how I did in the race,

43:35.774 --> 43:37.308
I'd still be a winner?

43:37.375 --> 43:39.376
Did you really believe that?

43:39.444 --> 43:40.978
No way.

43:41.046 --> 43:43.080
I knew you were gonna win.

43:43.148 --> 43:44.448
I even bet on you.

43:44.516 --> 43:46.117
Really?
Yeah. Win, place or show.

43:47.551 --> 43:49.686
Well, how'd you do?

43:49.753 --> 43:51.054
Ah, well,
the odds weren't great,

43:51.122 --> 43:52.789
but even still
I almost doubled my money.

43:52.857 --> 43:54.157
No way!
Yeah.

43:54.225 --> 43:56.125
How much did you make?

43:57.127 --> 44:00.830
Three hundred
and fifty-six cents...

44:00.897 --> 44:03.265
On a two dollar bet.

44:03.334 --> 44:05.100
You only bet two dollars on me?

44:05.168 --> 44:06.602
Well,
I only had two dollars.

44:06.670 --> 44:07.804
You...

44:07.871 --> 44:09.071
Yo!

44:18.614 --> 44:19.548
Oh!

44:20.883 --> 44:21.950
Oh!

44:29.423 --> 44:39.623
