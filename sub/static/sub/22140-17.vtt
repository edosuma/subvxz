00:02.620 --> 00:04.170
Dre: The best part
of the holidays is family.

00:04.170 --> 00:06.380
The worst part of the holidays
is Bow's family.

00:06.380 --> 00:09.290
So I always try
to stake out the best holidays

00:09.290 --> 00:12.040
and reserve them
for my side of the family.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.790
I have MLK Day...
Yes.

00:13.790 --> 00:15.540
...July 4th, Labor Day...
Mmm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:15.540 --> 00:17.170
Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
Unbelievable.

00:17.170 --> 00:18.920
Now you choose yours --
Ooh, wait a minute. Hold on.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.830
Wait, Dre --
Let me get -- let me get
New Year's real quick. Okay.

00:20.830 --> 00:22.210
Seriously?
Uh-huh.

00:22.210 --> 00:24.710
Dre, come on! You took
all the good holidays.

00:24.710 --> 00:26.880
Come on. You say that like you
came out of this empty-handed.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.330
Hell, I gave you
every other Easter.

00:28.330 --> 00:30.710
Really? You gave it
to me, Dre?

00:30.710 --> 00:32.750
This is ridiculous.
Okay.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.040
Bow and I both love Easter.

00:35.040 --> 00:38.120
It's the one holiday
neither of us would give up.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.540
We came up with a system
of odds and evens,

00:41.540 --> 00:43.710
with our families
switching off every other year.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.290
Ooh! Ooh!
My family's here.

00:46.290 --> 00:48.080
No, no, no. That's my family.
Dre, it's my year.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.710
Bow, it's
definitely my year.

00:49.710 --> 00:51.540
No, okay,
it's my year, Dre.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.170
Hi!

00:54.170 --> 00:55.500
Hi!
Hi!

00:55.500 --> 00:57.170
Aah! This was
supposed to be my year!

00:59.120 --> 01:00.580
Hello.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.500
Damn.

01:02.500 --> 01:05.500
I forgot
how white your white half is.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.330
Dre.

01:11.330 --> 01:13.580
Yay! I'm so glad
you guys all here.

01:13.580 --> 01:16.040
Just make yourself comfortable.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.500
Okay, what the hell happened?

01:17.500 --> 01:19.330
What are your white cousins
doing here?

01:19.330 --> 01:21.790
Dre, I told you,
this year was mine.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.620
Last year
was supposed to be mine,

01:23.620 --> 01:25.250
but we skipped it
because Devante was born.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.120
Okay, we saw your family
at the hospital.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.750
That counts as your year.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.750
I almost died.

01:30.750 --> 01:34.120
And I had to watch HGTV
with them in the waiting room.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.250
Count it.
No, I will not
count it, Dre.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.500
And, okay, I know how
you feel about my family,

01:37.500 --> 01:38.830
but you only see them
once a year,

01:38.830 --> 01:41.170
and I have to see your mom
every...single...day.

01:41.170 --> 01:42.500
I accept your apology.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.710
Okay, I get that we
have never done this before,

01:44.710 --> 01:47.420
but we can still have
a lovely Easter

01:47.420 --> 01:49.420
with both of our families
here together.

01:49.420 --> 01:51.250
The only important thing

01:51.250 --> 01:53.330
is that you and I
are a united front.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.580
We can get through this
as a team.

01:55.580 --> 01:57.000
You and me.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.290
You and me.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.290
Thank you.
I got it.

01:59.290 --> 02:00.290
Hi!

02:00.290 --> 02:01.580
Oh, hey!
Hey!

02:01.580 --> 02:03.880
Great to see you guys.
Hey!

02:03.880 --> 02:05.330
Oh.
Mm.

02:05.330 --> 02:06.920
Life of the party,
as usual.
Yep.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.920
He had a long week
at work, so...
Of course.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.420
You know, I don't --

02:10.420 --> 02:12.460
I don't think I've heard
him talk in two years.
Okay.

02:12.460 --> 02:14.170
He's had a long
two years at work.

02:14.170 --> 02:16.330
I'm excited for you
to try my beets.

02:16.330 --> 02:18.620
By Dre?

02:18.620 --> 02:20.000
Get it?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.250
No, I made this.
Oh.

02:21.250 --> 02:23.830
With burrata
and fennel pollen.

02:23.830 --> 02:25.540
It's delicious,
healthy,

02:25.540 --> 02:27.000
and just as filling
as a meat dish.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.330
Oh.

02:28.330 --> 02:30.250
That sounds like
it...could be true.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.000
You know we hate
to come empty-handed.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.290
Oh, we're so glad
you don't.

02:33.290 --> 02:34.790
I hate when you come.

02:34.790 --> 02:36.040
Shh!
Okay.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.170
Hey!
Hey, Grandma.

02:37.170 --> 02:38.420
Oh,
let me grab that.

02:38.420 --> 02:40.290
Thank you.
Let me get that for you.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.120
Hey, let me --

02:41.120 --> 02:43.040
Oh. Nope? Okay.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.120
I want you all to know
I stood outside for an hour.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.790
Oh.
What?

02:46.790 --> 02:49.880
And three people offered
to help me find my way home.

02:49.880 --> 02:50.960
Oh.
Oh.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.580
You know, this is really
a nice neighborhood.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.290
Yeah.
Well, that's why
we moved here, Grandma Mabel.

02:54.290 --> 02:55.420
Yeah.
Good choice.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.460
Gwen:
I hope you don't mind,

02:58.460 --> 03:00.710
but I had to bring
my fur babies.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.710
Buttons
is for my anxiety,

03:02.710 --> 03:04.880
and Pinches
is for Buttons' anxiety.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.210
So keep it cool.

03:06.210 --> 03:07.620
Keep it cool.

03:07.620 --> 03:08.830
Yay!
Yay.

03:08.830 --> 03:10.580
Your family's here.
They're here.

03:13.380 --> 03:15.880
Wow!
You look so grown-up.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.580
High school will do that
to a girl.

03:17.580 --> 03:20.750
Mm. Yeah.
Uh...totally.

03:21.830 --> 03:24.580
Oh, sorry.
I was out late last night.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.670
You guys
get to stay out late?

03:26.670 --> 03:27.960
Yeah, we don't have
a curfew.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.170
No curfew?

03:30.170 --> 03:32.460
I-I'd stay out
'til like 10:00.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.080
No, no -- 9:30.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.580
Look --
she's wearing lipstick.

03:36.580 --> 03:38.880
Not lip gloss --
stick.

03:38.880 --> 03:42.040
So, what about you guys?
What's new?

03:42.040 --> 03:44.380
Well,
one cool thing is --

03:44.380 --> 03:46.080
I'll tell you
what's new.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.710
We are so sorry.

03:48.710 --> 03:52.330
It's time for the 2018
Johnson family egg hunt --

03:52.330 --> 03:55.170
planned by me,
administered by me,

03:55.170 --> 03:57.540
all disputes
will be adjudicated by me.

03:57.540 --> 03:58.830
But have you
worked out the kinks?

04:01.500 --> 04:02.830
Hey, guys!
Guys, I found --

04:06.000 --> 04:08.210
Did I just kill a chicken?

04:08.210 --> 04:11.210
I don't care. I'll kill
as many chickens as I have to.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.620
I don't know --
those used to be fun,

04:13.620 --> 04:15.960
but I think we're
a little too old for egg hunts.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.500
I drove a car
last night.

04:17.500 --> 04:18.880
What!

04:18.880 --> 04:20.290
We're too old, too.

04:20.290 --> 04:22.920
Y-Yeah. Eh, uh,
forget what I said.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.380
Uh, that round,
pink thing on that book

04:25.380 --> 04:29.040
is of no interest
to me.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.580
Is there candy in it?

04:30.580 --> 04:32.120
I-I don't --
I don't care.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.500
I get it.
Everyone's growing up.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.080
But, uh, maybe you'll
change your minds later.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.120
No presh.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.670
But...let me drop this.

04:41.670 --> 04:42.880
There is candy in them.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.620
Oh, I knew it!

04:46.620 --> 04:48.750
Oh. So what? Psh.

04:48.750 --> 04:51.170
While I was cooking,
avoiding the white cousins,

04:51.170 --> 04:52.960
finally,
the one I liked arrived.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.210
Anybody home?
I'm a burglar.

04:56.460 --> 04:59.500
Gary's here!
What's up?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.290
Mm! What's goin' on,
brother?
Not too much.

05:01.290 --> 05:02.750
Good to see you, man.
Yeah.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.620
Finally, one of
the good ones shows up.

05:04.620 --> 05:06.540
Eh --

05:06.540 --> 05:07.670
What'd you bring
with you?

05:07.670 --> 05:09.080
Well, glad you asked.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.710
It took a lot of spilled flour
and a few third-degree burns,

05:11.710 --> 05:13.750
but I baked us
a sweet potato pie.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.460
From scratch?
You know it.

05:15.460 --> 05:17.040
I love you, Gary.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.790
You are the man,
G-Money.

05:18.790 --> 05:20.830
Alright.
All for you, D-Money.

05:20.830 --> 05:23.580
Hey!
You made a pie.
I did.

05:23.580 --> 05:25.210
I made a pie.
Okay.

05:25.210 --> 05:26.420
Yours looks good.

05:28.330 --> 05:29.540
Too good.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.330
Well, I put a lot
of hard work into this pie.

05:31.330 --> 05:33.540
Mm-hmm. Somebody put a lot
of hard work into this pie,

05:33.540 --> 05:35.080
but it wasn't you.

05:35.080 --> 05:38.420
Now, you know
that's a Patti LaBelle pie!

05:38.420 --> 05:41.420
You trying to take credit
for Patti's work?

05:41.420 --> 05:43.040
Well, I did write
the song "On My Own."

05:44.670 --> 05:46.380
Oh, we're not joking.
Okay.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.000
I know what you did, Gary,
and I'm gonna prove it.

05:51.420 --> 05:54.170
Homemade, my ass.

[ Sporting event plays
on television ]
Ah, come on!

05:55.620 --> 05:57.000
Here, sweetie.
Oh.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.830
Ooh! Meat!

05:58.830 --> 06:00.120
Thank you, baby.
You're welcome.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.670
What was that?

06:03.670 --> 06:05.710
Nothing. Nothing.

06:05.710 --> 06:08.880
I've never seen you make a plate
of food for Andre before.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.460
Mom,
Junior was just asking

06:13.460 --> 06:15.710
if you could explain
your crystal work to him.

06:15.710 --> 06:17.040
No, I wasn't.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.540
But I am interested!

06:18.540 --> 06:20.170
Let me get my pouch!

06:20.170 --> 06:22.330
Go ahead, you guys.

06:22.330 --> 06:23.880
Here, babe.
Oh. Hey, thanks, baby.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.500
Yeah, no problem.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.750
It's no big deal,
Mom.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.120
I think it's a big deal

06:28.120 --> 06:30.120
when my daughter's being
subservient to a man.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.380
I'm not being
subservient.

06:31.380 --> 06:33.250
It's just -- It's --
It's what we do.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.790
Gwen...

06:34.790 --> 06:36.580
Do you make a plate
for your husband?
No. Mom --

06:36.580 --> 06:38.000
You mean physically
make him a plate?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.210
Like at Color Me Mine?

06:39.210 --> 06:40.460
No.

06:40.460 --> 06:42.750
Do you put together
a plate of food

06:42.750 --> 06:44.330
for an able

Why on Earth
would I do that?

his own plate.
Oh, boy.

a liberated woman.

06:49.460 --> 06:51.920
Yay!
Rainbow prefers to be
subservient.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.960
No --
Leave her alone,
Aunt Alicia.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.170
Okay?
Thank you.

06:56.170 --> 06:57.500
It's 2018.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.880
as liberated or as subservient
as she wants.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.170
That's not helpful.
Question.

07:03.170 --> 07:05.330
Mm
Do you have
any nitrite-free bacon

07:05.330 --> 07:07.120
that I could chew up
to feed to Buttons?

07:08.540 --> 07:12.040
I-I have...Canadian bacon,
I believe, in the fridge.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.170
How does that sound,
Buttons?

07:15.380 --> 07:18.250
Oh. Oh, he's wondering
if you can run to the store.

07:20.170 --> 07:21.830
Oh, that's not
what he said.

07:21.830 --> 07:23.210
Mnh-mnh.

07:24.460 --> 07:26.790
Have you guys
seen "Blood Tsunami"?

07:26.790 --> 07:29.120
The movie that made a whole
theater vomit and pass out?

07:29.120 --> 07:31.120
We saw it last week.
Threw up twice.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.580
Um, yeah, yeah.

07:32.580 --> 07:35.080
W-We're totally
brave enough to see it.
Mm-hmm.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.040
It's just, o-our mom won't
let us watch scary movies.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.790
It's okay. I can show you
a clip on my phone.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.040
Oh, wow. How lucky
to get to see this.

07:45.710 --> 07:48.920
Watching pirated material
can earn you five years in jail

and/or a fine
of up to $250,000!

Is it worth it?

Is this guy serious?

07:56.620 --> 07:58.420
Now that we've avoided
a felony,

07:58.420 --> 08:00.580
let me holler at you
about this egg hunt.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.670
So, the prizes this year aren't
just Peeps and Cadbury Eggs.

08:03.670 --> 08:07.290
I've also got Cadbury Eggs
shaped like Peeps.

08:07.290 --> 08:09.040
Changes the calculus,
huh?

08:11.960 --> 08:15.750
God! Now that we're not
doing it, I see eggs everywhere!

08:15.750 --> 08:18.040
Oh, what is that?! Come on!
Come on! That's a foul!

are looking nice.

I can't see around your head.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.380
Yeah, I got some great
succulents coming in myself.

08:27.380 --> 08:30.380
But I lost some good guys
during the frost.

08:30.380 --> 08:33.750
You can't plant
a Zone 8 stunner in Zone 11

08:33.750 --> 08:35.500
and expect good results,
you know what I'm saying?

08:35.500 --> 08:38.500
U-U-Uncle Paul, um,
late-game free throws

08:38.500 --> 08:40.330
aren't the best time
to be talking about gardening.

08:40.330 --> 08:43.000
Oh.
Of course.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.170
Where's my head?
Uh-huh.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.750
Sorry about him.

08:47.750 --> 08:50.250
You know, I wish Bow's family
was all you, Gary.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.670
I miss
the old shorts.

08:53.670 --> 08:54.790
Hmm?

08:54.790 --> 08:56.620
I mean,
they hug the body.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.620
They really let you see
the shape of the equipment.

08:59.620 --> 09:00.830
Grandma.

09:00.830 --> 09:06.040
♪♪

09:06.040 --> 09:07.750
Oh, yeah! Oh!

09:07.750 --> 09:09.540
Mom, I have bad news.

09:09.540 --> 09:10.750
It's Jack and Diane.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.040
What?

09:12.040 --> 09:15.120
I-I don't want to alarm you,
but, uh...

09:15.120 --> 09:16.830
they've lost
their sense of wonder.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.290
Okay.
So, I-I guess
I do want to alarm you.

09:20.290 --> 09:21.170
Okay.

09:21.170 --> 09:24.120
Just...keep your head
on a swivel.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.330
I -- Yep.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.620
I got it.
Jack, do you want
some carrots?

09:28.620 --> 09:30.420
Um...no.

09:30.420 --> 09:32.710
Uh, are you making
Jack a plate?

09:32.710 --> 09:35.250
Yeah.
Why?

09:35.250 --> 09:37.790
Because I always do.
It's nice.

09:37.790 --> 09:39.210
You do it for Dad.

09:39.210 --> 09:40.620
Continuing the cycle.

09:40.620 --> 09:41.750
Uh --

09:41.750 --> 09:44.120
Yeah, well...
not anymore.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.710
Wh--
Nope.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.040
Everybody can make
their own plates from now on!

09:48.040 --> 09:48.880
What?

09:48.880 --> 09:51.670
The cycle
has been broken.

09:51.670 --> 09:52.750
Good for you, Bow.

09:52.750 --> 09:53.920
Thank you.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.620
What is going on
in my house right now?

09:56.620 --> 09:59.210
Mom's white family
is ruining it for all of us.

09:59.210 --> 10:01.750
Yeah.
I know, little buddy.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.790
I'm not ready
to make my own plate.

10:03.790 --> 10:05.460
Without Diane,
it would just be

10:05.460 --> 10:07.920
all deviled eggs
and Cool Whip.

10:09.210 --> 10:10.750
I mean,
that sounds good, right?

10:15.080 --> 10:16.540
Ooh, I-I don't know
what to take.

10:16.540 --> 10:17.920
I feel paralyzed.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.330
No, hey, hey, hey.

10:19.330 --> 10:20.960
Don't worry about it,
buddy, alright?

10:20.960 --> 10:22.290
I will make
your plate,

10:22.290 --> 10:25.880
because making a plate
is not a big deal.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.210
Dre.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.670
That is
what I thought, too,

10:28.670 --> 10:31.250
but when I do it,
it's a choice.
Mm-hmm.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.710
I don't want Diane to think
she has to wait on a man.

10:33.710 --> 10:36.330
You're worried about Diane
waiting on a man?

10:36.330 --> 10:38.920
You need to worry about her
poisoning her rivals.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.580
Not just rivals.

10:41.580 --> 10:42.880
Y--
She's so scary.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.710
So what if she makes
her brother a plate?

10:44.710 --> 10:46.620
That does not
make her weak.

10:46.620 --> 10:49.830
I shot Earl in the belly,
and I still make him a plate.

10:49.830 --> 10:51.830
Yeah, all in all,
not a bad trade.

10:51.830 --> 10:53.080
Whoap!

10:53.080 --> 10:54.670
You're not staying?

10:54.670 --> 10:56.250
Unh-unh. Didn't we see
these people last Easter?

10:56.250 --> 10:58.290
Yes!
I was in the hospital.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.080
Remember?
I almost died.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.670
Still, I-I think
it should count.

11:01.670 --> 11:03.250
I'd count it.

11:03.250 --> 11:05.170
I thought we had
a united front.

11:05.170 --> 11:07.750
I know, but my mom just
brought up a really good point.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.920
I don't want to be passing on
a sexist tradition, Dre.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.170
Okay, we will argue
about this later, okay?
Mm-hmm.

11:12.170 --> 11:14.210
But let's hold it together
until after dinner,

11:14.210 --> 11:16.040
when we can kick these people
out of here.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.330
Enough. These people are
my family, and I love them,

11:18.330 --> 11:20.250
so please,
just -- just be gentle.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.330
I'm trying.
Okay.

11:21.330 --> 11:22.670
Hi.
Hi!

11:22.670 --> 11:24.880
Sorry, um, I'm just wondering
if there's any way

11:24.880 --> 11:29.210
you could arrange
a calm, dark room for my dogs.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.960
They got a bit overstimulated
during the basketball game,

11:31.960 --> 11:33.460
seeing a ball
they can't have.

11:37.460 --> 11:40.210
Enjoying yourself,
Gary?

11:40.210 --> 11:41.540
Yeah.
I always love --

11:41.540 --> 11:43.670
Quick -- what's
the butter-to-shortening ratio

11:43.670 --> 11:44.460
in your crust?

11:45.670 --> 11:47.540
I used all butter.
Mm-hmm.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.830
What temperature
did you cook your pie on?

11:49.830 --> 11:50.670
And for how long?

11:51.710 --> 11:53.540
350 for an hour,

11:53.540 --> 11:56.250
after I boiled the
s-sweet potatoes for an hour.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.500
Ooooooh! You smooth.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.170
You know who else
speaks smoothly

12:01.170 --> 12:03.880
with a wicked tongue?

12:03.880 --> 12:05.500
The devil?

12:05.500 --> 12:06.290
Yeah.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.920
Oh. Interesting.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.250
No fried chicken...

12:12.250 --> 12:14.080
no greens.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.880
Maybe on my next pass.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.580
Oh.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.460
Thank you all so much
for being here.

12:19.460 --> 12:20.830
This is so nice.

12:20.830 --> 12:22.330
It's such a special day

12:22.330 --> 12:24.080
when we're surrounded
by so much family.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.920
Ah. Yeah.
Yeah.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.920
So...much...family.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.790
We are starving.

12:30.790 --> 12:32.790
We did a fun run
before we came today,

12:32.790 --> 12:34.120
didn't we, hon?
Dre: Oh. Fun run.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.750
Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.580
Hon?
The run, it was fun?

12:37.580 --> 12:38.710
He loved it.

12:38.710 --> 12:41.790
Rainbow:
I be-- believe you.
Yeah.

12:41.790 --> 12:44.420
That's when I noticed
that it wasn't just Gwen

12:44.420 --> 12:46.920
who had made
a strong food choice.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.000
It was all of Bow's family.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.830
Something wrong?

12:50.830 --> 12:53.580
You guys don't have any
mac and cheese on your plates.

12:53.580 --> 12:55.920
Oh, you know,
it's very rich,

12:55.920 --> 12:58.210
and we're trying to watch
our calories and cholesterol.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.580
Really?

12:59.580 --> 13:02.420
Because burrata
has much more fat than cheddar.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.040
Yeah, but it
tastes very light.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.380
You should
really try our beets.

13:05.380 --> 13:07.750
I would, but I see
bringing beets to Easter

13:07.750 --> 13:09.580
as an act of aggression.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.830
Pump your brakes, Dre.

13:10.830 --> 13:12.120
O--
Just...

13:12.120 --> 13:13.790
Well, I-I'm sorry.

13:13.790 --> 13:16.620
I just don't see how you skip
over mac and cheese for beets.

13:16.620 --> 13:17.880
I love beets.

13:17.880 --> 13:18.710
Don't beat up on beets.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.210
Oh, Paul,
you're so funny.

13:21.210 --> 13:22.420
Okay, I'll give you that.
That's a good one.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.120
And beets
are very healthy.

13:24.120 --> 13:27.040
Well, food isn't
about just health.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.170
L-Let's say
someone you love died.

13:30.170 --> 13:32.750
What? What are we --
One of your dogs, maybe.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.330
Would you comfort yourself

13:34.330 --> 13:37.250
with a nice, warm bowl
of mac and cheese

13:37.250 --> 13:41.000
or a cold, slimy beet?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.460
My Clarence
used to hate beets.

13:43.460 --> 13:45.420
He called them
"blood potatoes."

13:45.420 --> 13:47.210
Oh. I never
heard that before.

13:47.210 --> 13:48.830
Interesting.
Mm-hmm.

13:48.830 --> 13:53.670
Maybe black and white people
taste things differently.

13:53.670 --> 13:55.960
Maybe I just don't eat
soul food

13:55.960 --> 13:57.460
because of
all the fat and salt.

13:57.460 --> 13:59.420
Is that all
you think soul food is?

13:59.420 --> 14:00.960
Huh?

14:00.960 --> 14:04.580
Do you have any idea why
we cook it the way that we do?

14:04.580 --> 14:08.120
Today, Dre will be cooking
with pig intestines, weeds,

14:08.120 --> 14:12.330
ham hocks, pig's feet,
lard, and hot water.

14:12.330 --> 14:13.420
Can that be right?

14:13.420 --> 14:14.830
Mm.

14:14.830 --> 14:16.880
Let's see
what he can make for us

14:16.880 --> 14:18.620
with these
tough ingredients.

14:19.880 --> 14:22.080
Dre: During slavery,
black people were lucky

14:22.080 --> 14:23.920
if we got the worst parts
of the pig,

14:23.920 --> 14:26.750
the toughest greens,
or even leftover cornmeal.

14:26.750 --> 14:29.750
We also had to figure out
how to make it taste good.

14:29.750 --> 14:33.500
So we used lard
and tons of seasoning.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.420
And even now
that we can afford better,

14:35.420 --> 14:37.670
we still like our food
highly seasoned.

14:37.670 --> 14:42.460
There's a reason that Beyoncé
has hot sauce in her bag.

14:42.460 --> 14:45.080
So, I've made collard greens
with ham hock,

14:45.080 --> 14:49.420
hot water cornbread,
and fried chitterlings.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.170
Well, that actually
looks amazing!

14:51.170 --> 14:53.040
You made this
from those ingredients?

14:53.040 --> 14:54.040
Yes, I did.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.540
Dre,
you've been chopped.

14:55.540 --> 14:57.290
But don't ever stop
chasing your dreams.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.040
But this is a dream.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.330
I don't know
what to tell you.

15:05.830 --> 15:09.250
We took white people's garbage
and we made it shine.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.210
That's why it hurts so much
when you turn your nose up,

15:13.210 --> 15:16.620
because when you reject
our food, you're rejecting us.

15:16.620 --> 15:18.540
Okay, this is crazy.

15:18.540 --> 15:21.210
Are you saying that
my taste in food is racist?

15:21.210 --> 15:22.580
Is that what he's saying?

15:22.580 --> 15:24.960
No, I don't think so.
That's not what he's saying.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.170
Because he said he's gonna be
so nice to my family.

15:27.170 --> 15:29.170
Okay, so,
does anybody want slaw?

15:29.170 --> 15:31.120
Do you want slaw?
Do you want slaw

15:31.120 --> 15:33.620
Is it so crazy
for us to believe

15:33.620 --> 15:36.620
that after our people were
on the bottom of this country

15:36.620 --> 15:38.380
for 400 years

15:38.380 --> 15:41.420
that our stuff
is seen as less

15:41.420 --> 15:44.620
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Preach, baby! Preach!

15:44.620 --> 15:47.290
Our stuff is never seen
as acceptable

15:47.290 --> 15:49.790
until white people
put their stamp on it.

15:49.790 --> 15:51.790
Dark skin was bad

15:51.790 --> 15:55.710
until white people saw
how nice they looked with a tan.

15:55.710 --> 15:59.120
Black music was jungle music
until Elvis stole it.

15:59.120 --> 16:04.210
And even our butts were too much
until Kim Kardashian came along.

16:04.210 --> 16:06.500
Okay, I'll say it.
Um...

16:06.500 --> 16:09.330
I've always thought black people
are better, you know?

16:09.330 --> 16:12.790
And it's a wonder you don't
rise up and kill all of us.

16:12.790 --> 16:14.120
Oh, I've tried.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.750
See? Gary gets it.

16:15.750 --> 16:18.620
I can't keep going around
in circles with you, Dre.

16:18.620 --> 16:20.920
You see race
in everything.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.920
Because it is
in everything.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.420
With pretty much anything,

16:25.420 --> 16:28.420
I can draw a direct line
to being black.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.960
It's my North Star,
which is why I know

16:30.960 --> 16:33.040
that if Rachael Ray
started a soul-food line

16:33.040 --> 16:34.620
and put it
in the frozen section,

16:34.620 --> 16:36.290
you would buy it right up.

16:39.380 --> 16:42.000
You think you're the only one
with a deep connection to food?

16:43.330 --> 16:45.460
Oh. Is Brian talking?

16:45.460 --> 16:48.670
I cook beets
because of my grandmother.

16:48.670 --> 16:51.210
When her family was hiding
in the woods from the Nazis,

16:51.210 --> 16:53.330
beets were all they had.

16:53.330 --> 16:56.580
So when we were kids,
she'd cook them for us

16:56.580 --> 16:58.380
and tell us stories
of how she survived.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.540
Now I like making them
for my kids --

17:02.540 --> 17:04.790
so they can, uh,
remember her.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.120
Oh.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.330
Okay.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.120
Maybe I'll try some.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.620
All of this talk
of who makes a plate for who

17:17.620 --> 17:20.080
and black food vs. white food

17:20.080 --> 17:22.080
had left our Easter dinner
pretty tense.

17:29.620 --> 17:31.080
Hot enough
for you guys out there?

17:33.250 --> 17:35.670
It's warm out--
warm outside. Warm.

17:41.380 --> 17:43.250
I see the neighbors
got a new car.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.250
Yeah, it's --
it's a pretty car.

17:45.250 --> 17:49.540
I don't care about slavery
or the Holocaust.

17:49.540 --> 17:50.540
Oh, Mabel.

17:52.250 --> 17:56.880
All I know is, I always loved
making my Clarence a plate.

17:56.880 --> 17:57.920
What's that, Grandma?

17:57.920 --> 17:59.380
Well, when we came up,

17:59.380 --> 18:02.670
it was different
from the way it is now.

18:02.670 --> 18:05.250
When a black man
went out into the world,

18:05.250 --> 18:07.920
they treated him
like he wasn't a man.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.500
Mm.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.000
So the least I could do
when Clarence came home

18:12.000 --> 18:14.460
was make him a plate --

18:14.460 --> 18:18.330
make him feel like
he was somebody,

18:18.330 --> 18:22.120
let him know
that somebody loved him,

18:22.120 --> 18:24.000
even though
the world didn't.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.330
Mm.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.120
I never looked at it
that way.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.790
Thank you
for sharing that.

18:35.420 --> 18:37.210
I think
that's a really good reason

18:37.210 --> 18:38.920
to make a plate
for someone you love.

18:39.830 --> 18:40.960
Hm.

18:41.920 --> 18:42.960
Mmm.

18:46.500 --> 18:50.330
Ohhh, this is such
a beautiful moment of healing.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.000
Does anyone else
want to open up?

18:53.000 --> 18:56.750
Perhaps about a lie
they've told about a pie?

18:59.330 --> 19:01.290
There is no lie.

19:01.290 --> 19:02.920
I made that pie myself.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.540
I worked my ass off
to impress you.

19:05.540 --> 19:08.460
I-I wanted to show you all
how much you mean to me.

19:08.460 --> 19:09.830
And we love you.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.290
No, I was talking
to the Black people.

19:14.380 --> 19:16.420
Riley and Hunter must think
we're such babies.

19:17.620 --> 19:18.710
What are
you guys doing?

19:18.710 --> 19:20.210
Uh...

19:20.210 --> 19:22.250
We just thought
it'd be hilarious

19:22.250 --> 19:24.540
to hunt eggs...
ironically.

19:24.540 --> 19:27.120
U-Uh...y-yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.000
That's -- That's how we hunt
for them, too, right?

19:29.000 --> 19:29.920
Yeah.
Yeah.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.210
Cool. Uh, sweet.

19:32.210 --> 19:34.250
If we really want
to clown Junior,

19:34.250 --> 19:35.960
we would go outside,
where there's tons of eggs.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.750
Yeah. Sure.

19:37.750 --> 19:38.880
Whatever.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.620
Um,
wouldn't it be dumb

19:40.620 --> 19:44.620
if we also just kept track
of who found the most eggs?

19:44.620 --> 19:45.830
It'd be me.

19:45.830 --> 19:47.250
I-Ironically.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.000
They do have wonder.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.380
Go, children.

19:54.380 --> 19:55.960
Find my eggs.

20:00.290 --> 20:02.120
Something sweet
for a sweetheart.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.880
Thank you.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.120
I like your smile.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.330
Ah.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.460
Call me
if I outlive your wife.

20:09.670 --> 20:12.000
Call me anytime.
I don't care about your wife.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.290
Mr. Johnson...
Hmm?

20:17.290 --> 20:18.290
I made you a plate.

20:18.290 --> 20:19.920
Oh.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.710
Well, Mrs. Johnson,
I made you a plate.

20:22.710 --> 20:23.710
No way.
Mm-hmm.

20:23.710 --> 20:25.290
Thank you.

20:25.290 --> 20:28.120
Hey, babe, I will try harder
with your family next time.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.710
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

20:29.710 --> 20:33.540
And, uh, Cinco de Mayo
is gonna be muy caliente.

20:33.540 --> 20:34.710
Mmm!

20:36.120 --> 20:38.790
Do you think I could take
some of the mac and cheese to go

20:38.790 --> 20:41.670
in case anyone
wants a midnight splurge?
Sure.

20:41.670 --> 20:44.420
Yeah, I think
that can be arranged.
Yeah.

20:44.420 --> 20:46.790
Wait a minute.
It's not for the dogs, is it?

20:46.790 --> 20:49.580
Oh, no. Buttons is
lactose-intolerant.

20:49.580 --> 20:53.000
Pinches is not, but we tell him
he is just to keep peace.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.040
Okay.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.580
You got it.
No problem.

20:58.210 --> 21:00.170
You're trying so hard
right now, aren't you?

21:00.170 --> 21:01.880
I am.
Mm-hmm.

21:01.880 --> 21:03.290
Bigger smile.

21:03.290 --> 21:04.420
Bigger.

21:04.420 --> 21:05.420
Mm-hmm.

21:05.420 --> 21:07.040
-Mom!
-Shh! Daddy's working!
