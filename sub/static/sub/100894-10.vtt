You can't slack off now!

01:10.779 --> 01:12.572
The road to State is tough!

01:21.998 --> 01:24.417
And my mom's letting me
look at drama camps for the summer.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.585
Oh.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.253
Well, I'm thinking
about spending the summer

01:27.337 --> 01:28.922
-with my dad in Atlanta.
-[CeCe] Bottom of the eighth,

01:29.005 --> 01:31.007
CeCe Matney is at the plate.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.594
The crowd's hushed.
The whole game lies on this one pitch.

01:34.677 --> 01:37.347
Will Ty Townsend go to prom with her?

01:40.809 --> 01:42.435
[CeCe] And here comes the pitch.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.729
Is it a homer or is it a strike?

01:44.813 --> 01:46.731
Here comes the swing!

01:49.025 --> 01:50.485
The lady deserves an answer.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.034
Well? [chuckles]

01:58.535 --> 01:59.661
Yeah. Yeah.

02:00.495 --> 02:05.041
[boys chanting] Prom!

02:14.801 --> 02:18.513
But Greg Maddux getting the Cy Young
three years in a row as a Brave,

02:18.596 --> 02:19.722
that sealed it for me.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.684
Well, that and getting my name
on a Braves jersey spelled right.

02:23.434 --> 02:26.187
That's why I wanted to play for them.
Brave to the grave.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.982
Oh, yeah, I get that,
but I'm a Kershaw fan.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.151
My dream team is the Dodgers.

02:31.568 --> 02:32.485
What?

02:32.569 --> 02:33.862
I tried to raise him right. I didn't.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.449
[sighs] Okay, Kyle,
who's your favorite ball player?

02:39.784 --> 02:41.995
Come on. Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, MO?

02:42.078 --> 02:43.121
[chuckles]

02:43.788 --> 02:45.415
-Well played, Coach.
-[Cal] Thank you.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.500
-You're not gonna sing, are you?
-Mm-mmm.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.835
[chuckles] Sing what?

02:48.918 --> 02:51.296
Shoeless Joe's a character
in <i>Damn Yankees,</i>

02:51.379 --> 02:52.922
a musical about baseball.

02:53.006 --> 02:53.923
[chuckles]

02:54.007 --> 02:55.717
-There's a musical about baseball?
-Yeah.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.137
Yeah. I might've done a little homework
before I came to dinner.

03:00.054 --> 03:02.473
I even learned a new dinosaur fact.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.268
That maiasauras are the best moms?

03:05.351 --> 03:08.271
Mm, pretty sure
that you have the best mom.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.731
[groans] Coach Cal.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.150
[Tyler]
Yeah. I'm right with you there, sis.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.277
[chuckles] I apologize about that.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.653
[laughs]

03:38.760 --> 03:39.594
[Ryan] Hey.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.016
I didn't expect you to be here.

03:45.099 --> 03:46.100
I'm not leaving.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.147
This conversation isn't over.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.613
I lived with her family.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.866
And they invited me to be...

04:03.034 --> 04:04.786
with them when she was born.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.541
I could hold her in one hand, Helen.

04:11.751 --> 04:12.877
And I did hold her...

04:14.629 --> 04:15.588
as she died.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.217
And her death,

04:19.300 --> 04:23.179
like nearly all the infant deaths
in that village that winter,

04:23.263 --> 04:24.597
it was preventable.

04:25.765 --> 04:29.435
It's irresponsible
to bring another child into a world

04:29.519 --> 04:32.146
that cannot support the people
already here.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.441
If you'd seen what I had seen...

04:35.525 --> 04:39.112
No. Having a child
could be our expression of hope.

04:39.195 --> 04:43.908
[stammers] It's a proclamation
that we're a part of raising a generation

04:43.992 --> 04:45.285
that could save us all.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.662
That is a fantasy.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.330
That is love!

04:54.836 --> 04:55.878
That's love.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.469
You survived your first serious dinner
with the three of them.

05:05.179 --> 05:06.222
[Maddie chuckles]

05:06.306 --> 05:08.933
I don't know if the MLB
has a trophy for that, but...

05:10.560 --> 05:11.477
I do.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.520
Huh.

05:15.606 --> 05:16.441
So...

05:17.984 --> 05:19.861
are you ready for your trial by fire?

05:20.486 --> 05:22.989
-You <i>are </i>gonna sing.
-[chuckles] Never.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.367
Uh, it's just dinner with an old buddy
from the Braves.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.579
Johnny is swinging through town
and I'd like for him to meet you.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.289
Dinner?

05:31.748 --> 05:34.083
With someone
who knows all the dirt on you?

05:34.917 --> 05:35.793
Yes, please.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.253
There is no dirt.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.548
Okay, fine.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.843
Here's all the dirt:
I was a player on and off the field.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.055
And I'm glad I got that out of my system
before I met you.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.734
I love you.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.113
Let's go away for the weekend.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.365
[exhales]

06:07.033 --> 06:08.076
Slow down a smidge.

06:11.037 --> 06:11.954
I have been slow.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.165
By my standards.

06:49.158 --> 06:52.078
Why does this hurt so much more
than all the other times?

06:56.874 --> 06:58.459
[sobs]

07:01.462 --> 07:03.381
Because this one is the last time.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.027

07:42.545 --> 07:44.797
[phone vibrating]

07:48.050 --> 07:49.177

07:54.432 --> 07:55.308
Oh, dear.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.727
[phone vibrating]

08:10.531 --> 08:12.241
Okay, there's no need to panic.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.495
It's 7:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning,
and she wants to pour it out.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.330
Yeah, okay, panic a little.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.707
-[Dana Sue] Oh.
-[Maddie] Oh, Jeez.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.920
Okay, maybe panic a little bit more.

08:24.587 --> 08:25.713
[Helen exhales]

08:26.714 --> 08:27.798
[groans]

08:31.135 --> 08:32.887
Are you all down for a margarita morning?

08:33.679 --> 08:34.680
[Maddie] Hmm.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.641
Yeah.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.851
[Dana Sue] Oh, come here.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.356
[blender whirring]

08:45.233 --> 08:49.612
Okay, Trotter is opening the spa,
and Isaac has the café covered.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.239
And Erik started prep at Sullivan's.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.282
I'm glad those two got back
from their jaunt when they did.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.201
-I know.
-[Helen] God bless <i>some </i>men.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.328
And speaking of the good ones,

08:57.411 --> 09:00.206
I'm gonna make sure
that Jeremy's taken care of, Dana Sue.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.542
I'm gonna see this farm project
through myself.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.460
Thank you, but one thing at a time.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.338
Yeah, I don't--
I don't need any consolation.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.424
I'm looking to get drunk and pregnant.
Probably in that order.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.218
-Oh, wow.
-Okay, all right, listen.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.845
We all know how painful it can be
to kick a man to the curb,

09:14.929 --> 09:19.267
but you don't just rebound yourself
out of the pan into hellfire.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.643
[Maddie]
Yeah, you were the one who told me

09:20.726 --> 09:22.645
that I needed to take some time to breathe

09:22.979 --> 09:25.648
and grieve and regain my balance.

09:25.731 --> 09:29.360
Yeah. And it's so much easier to say it
than to hear it, isn't it, ladies?

09:29.443 --> 09:32.280
You know what?
You go on and melt down, all right,

09:32.363 --> 09:35.741
but just stop all this talk
about getting pregnant. It's alarming.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.994
Well, I've been thinking about it
for a while now.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.288
Even got a specialist's name from Howie.

09:40.371 --> 09:43.082
Oh, well, thanks for letting us know
before the baby shower.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.293
Well, I was gonna tell you, but then...

09:48.629 --> 09:51.340
So, I'm gonna make an appointment
with this doctor

09:51.757 --> 09:53.926
and we're gonna get this show on the road.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.345
Right after I track down
a bottle of my good rum,

09:56.429 --> 09:58.180
which is what these smoothies need.

10:07.857 --> 10:08.733
Hey, buddy,

10:08.816 --> 10:10.818
thanks so much for coming over so late.

10:10.901 --> 10:14.280
You know, the boss and her ladies
had a rough day today.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.324
Yeah,
I was sorry to hear about Helen and Ryan.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.826
Yeah, well,
now Maddie feels like she's behind

10:18.909 --> 10:20.286
and she won't stop working and go home.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.455
I thought you might be able
to talk some sense into her.

10:22.538 --> 10:24.749
And if I can't, I'll just stay and help.

10:24.832 --> 10:25.708
Appreciate it.

10:26.876 --> 10:27.752
I'm gonna take off.

10:37.053 --> 10:37.887
Maddie?

10:38.387 --> 10:39.305
[Maddie] In here.

10:53.736 --> 10:54.570
[chuckles]

10:55.696 --> 10:56.906
Surprise.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.700
I think Trotter owes me a beer.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.119
Or maybe I owe him one.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.289
[chuckles]

11:05.665 --> 11:09.543
When you said that you wanted to go away,

11:09.627 --> 11:12.922
I pumped the brakes because...

11:14.840 --> 11:17.301
I'm still not doing
a good job of trusting.

11:19.053 --> 11:19.887
Me?

11:20.346 --> 11:21.180
Me.

11:22.890 --> 11:26.644
Trust that I can give myself
to a relationship,

11:27.353 --> 11:28.229
to you,

11:28.979 --> 11:30.606
in the way that I want to,

11:31.065 --> 11:33.359
and the way that you deserve.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.905
Sitting there with Helen today,

11:37.988 --> 11:40.449
I was thinking about the two of them
and...

11:42.159 --> 11:44.036
thinking about the two of us and...

11:44.745 --> 11:47.456
I just... I realized
that I have been holding back

11:47.873 --> 11:48.916
out of fear.

11:50.459 --> 11:51.293
So...

11:52.795 --> 11:54.046
I want to move forward...

11:55.589 --> 11:56.465
in faith.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.885
In faith in our future,

12:01.429 --> 12:02.430
faith in us.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.643
[Maddie chuckles] So...

12:09.061 --> 12:12.690
I asked Erik to recreate the dessert

12:12.773 --> 12:15.651
that we missed out on
the last time we were here alone.

12:18.904 --> 12:22.450
Well, I look forward
to figuring out our future

12:23.325 --> 12:24.618
at the pace of your choice.

12:24.702 --> 12:25.703

12:40.926 --> 12:41.927
[Katie] Daddy!

12:42.011 --> 12:43.596
-You're here.
-Hey!

12:44.305 --> 12:47.183
I prayed for you extra hard
in church this morning, Daddy.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.019
Mom says you're sad and all alone.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.355
[Bill chuckles]

12:53.439 --> 12:55.691
Well, thank you, ladybug.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.278
Why don't you run along
and get your stuff?

12:59.653 --> 13:00.863
[Bill laughs]

13:02.156 --> 13:03.699
I didn't quite put it like that.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.951
Well, it's not entirely untrue.

13:06.827 --> 13:11.207
Listen, you got a minute
to chat about our visitation schedule?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.209
-Is there a problem?
-No.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.170
I snagged a couple of tickets to <i>Hamilton</i>

13:16.253 --> 13:18.214
when it comes to Charlotte right soon,

13:18.297 --> 13:21.801
and I was hoping to take Kyle,
make a weekend of it.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.011
Hmm.

13:24.094 --> 13:27.431
I didn't realize Kyle disappearing
shook you so hard.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.099
Yeah,

13:29.517 --> 13:30.935
I don't know if you've noticed,

13:31.018 --> 13:34.480
but I've made some pretty poor decisions
of late,

13:35.356 --> 13:36.398
and, um...

13:37.316 --> 13:39.777
I'd like to try
and get my life back on the rails,

13:40.194 --> 13:41.403
at least a wheel or two.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.200
-Yeah, we'll work it out.
-Appreciate it.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.662
Ty and Kyle have tons of homework.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.080
So it's just you and me, Daddy.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.624
Well, that's just fine with me, Katydid.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.167
You pick what we're gonna do.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.127
-Yes!
-Oh.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.296
Come on.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.766
And the whole team
was standing there chanting

14:10.850 --> 14:12.434
as if Ty had just won the World Series

14:12.518 --> 14:14.436
instead of agreeing to go to prom.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.688
So stupid.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.314
Yeah, I didn't go to my prom.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.860
My mom said I'd regret missing it,
but I don't.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.653
I don't think my mom went to hers either.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.238
I figured she went with your dad.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.240
Oh, no, Mom and Dad
went to high school together,

14:26.323 --> 14:29.201
but they didn't start dating
until after Mom got back into town.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.161
How long was she gone?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.789
Um, I'm not sure exactly.

14:34.498 --> 14:38.252
Mom always says that it was high school,
high living, high time she came home.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.379
-Did she ever mention--
-[Micah grunts]

14:41.213 --> 14:42.423
May I speak to the chef?

14:43.132 --> 14:45.050
-Hey!
-Hey! Oh, my gosh.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.344
We could do a festival of sorts,

14:47.428 --> 14:49.388
like Taste of Serenity.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.140
-I think that's a great idea.
-[Dana Sue] Yeah!

14:51.223 --> 14:52.433
-Hey, Mom? Surprise.
-Yeah.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.143
[gasps]

14:54.643 --> 14:56.103
Oh, as I live and breathe.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.688
Micah Harrison!

14:57.771 --> 15:00.107
-Are you really here?
- Let me prove it. [kiss]

15:00.190 --> 15:01.358
[Dana Sue laughs]

15:01.984 --> 15:05.362
-Oh, it's so wonderful to see you.
-You too.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.948
Oh. Well, I was hoping you'd say so.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.408
[laughing]

15:09.491 --> 15:12.411
Oh, sorry, uh, this is Micah Harrison.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.204
Hi, nice to meet you.

15:14.288 --> 15:17.583
-I'm an old friend of Dana Sue's.
-He is one of my dearest friends

15:17.666 --> 15:21.253
and my beloved companion
in some of my craziest adventures.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.171
[laughs]

15:22.254 --> 15:25.382
And the man who made Sullivan's possible.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.425
Hmm. Yeah.

15:26.508 --> 15:27.551
Made it possible?

15:28.385 --> 15:30.763
I'm the seed money.
Dana Sue's silent partner.

15:31.305 --> 15:35.434
-I can't believe you're here.
-Come here. Oh, gosh. So good.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.478
[Dana Sue] Oh, life is better with you.

15:37.561 --> 15:38.437
[Dana Sue laughs]

15:38.520 --> 15:41.023
And shavasana.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.445
[Trotter] Exhale.

15:49.740 --> 15:50.616
[Maddie] Trotter.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.202
You broke her.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.207
Melted, not broken.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.876
[Trotter]
Sometimes it takes lying on the floor,

16:00.960 --> 16:03.128
not going left, not going right,

16:03.212 --> 16:04.463
to get over someone.

16:05.547 --> 16:08.509
And she's to be commended
for being so honest with her feelings

16:08.592 --> 16:10.803
this early in the grieving process.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.596
[Maddie chuckles]

16:19.812 --> 16:22.106
This puddle on the floor,

16:23.107 --> 16:24.650
formerly known as Helen,

16:24.733 --> 16:27.486
has taught me most of what I know
about resiliency.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.699
Well, I'm gonna try something new,

16:32.533 --> 16:34.034
like watching the front desk.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.077
[Maddie laughs]

16:41.667 --> 16:43.043
[Helen inhales]

16:46.505 --> 16:47.881
Do the storms ever stop?

16:52.386 --> 16:53.303
No.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.683
But neither do the rainbows.

17:10.529 --> 17:14.575
Honestly, I'm so glad to see you,
but I wish you'd come on another day.

17:14.658 --> 17:17.786
Things are so hectic around here.
Can you bring these to the cooler, please?

17:17.870 --> 17:19.329
My sous chef is out.

17:19.413 --> 17:22.666
He is doing a special dinner
for a charity group, and I...

17:25.794 --> 17:28.005
-Okay, all right, you know what?
-[laughs]

17:28.547 --> 17:29.798
You have a seat at the bar,

17:29.882 --> 17:32.009
and I'm gonna make you
something wonderful.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.052
I'll cook for you.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.763
Then you two can sit together
and catch up.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.307
This young man is on his way
to being a star.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.185
And I am so proud of him.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.186
You should be too.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.646
I have no doubt.
I see a lot of myself in you, Isaac.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.775
Ambitious, attentive. Great smile, huh?

17:48.400 --> 17:51.403
-Well, check, check, check.
-[laughs]

17:51.487 --> 17:53.322
And I appreciate your generous offer,

17:53.405 --> 17:57.242
but please understand I cannot come into
this magnificent woman's kitchen

17:57.326 --> 17:59.703
and miss my opportunity
to rub shoulders with her,

17:59.787 --> 18:01.121
like we did in the old days.

18:01.205 --> 18:04.208
Okay, please do not tell
any of those stories in front of my staff.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.960
-Rule number one of the kitchen.
-[both laugh]

18:07.044 --> 18:09.296
What say we cook together?
All three of us.

18:09.379 --> 18:12.758
Dana Sue and I have plenty of time
to eat and reconnect later.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.009
-Yeah.
-Yes, sir.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.719
I mean, yes, Chef.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.763
Uh, if it's okay with you, Chef.

18:19.014 --> 18:21.433
[in French]
Let the good times roll, my dear.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.268
-[in English] Oh!
-Let's do it.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.687
-Let's get hot in the kitchen.
-Let's get hot in the kitchen!

18:25.771 --> 18:28.023
-Thank you. Oh, here you go, gloves.
-Thank you.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.900
-Gloves in this kitchen.
-My gloves!

18:29.983 --> 18:30.901
[Dana Sue laughs]

18:36.949 --> 18:38.951
Ty and CeCe are going to prom.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.830
She asked him in front of everybody.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.165
I didn't know that.

18:48.418 --> 18:50.420
How did you prom-posal Mom?

18:50.504 --> 18:51.797
Well... [laughs]

18:52.548 --> 18:54.091
...when your mom and I
were in high school,

18:54.174 --> 18:56.343
asking somebody to prom was simpler.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.555
You waited to get real fancy
till you asked her to marry you.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.474
How did you ask Mom to marry you?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.602
Well, first...

19:06.603 --> 19:10.524
I had to sneak over to Nana and Papa's
and ask their permission.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.235
Why? They don't get to decide.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.738
[laughs] It's just how it was done
in those days.

19:18.866 --> 19:19.825
And, uh...

19:21.743 --> 19:23.328
once they said it was okay,

19:24.621 --> 19:26.915
I went and bought
a beautiful diamond ring.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.501
And I told your mama

19:29.585 --> 19:32.546
that I wanted to take her
to a fancy restaurant in Charleston,

19:32.629 --> 19:34.381
'cause
I'd just gotten into medical school.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.175
You weren't a doctor yet?

19:36.258 --> 19:37.718
[laughs] No.

19:38.719 --> 19:39.678
Not yet.

19:41.889 --> 19:42.806
And so...

19:44.141 --> 19:45.559
we got all dressed up...

19:46.518 --> 19:49.188
and we had a wonderful dinner.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.151
And when the waiter...

19:55.152 --> 19:57.613
came over and asked us
what we wanted for dessert,

19:58.447 --> 20:01.575
well, I told him I wanted
the sweetest thing in the restaurant.

20:05.454 --> 20:08.498
Then I got down on one knee,
in front of your mom, and...

20:10.918 --> 20:13.295
I took out that ring, and I said...

20:22.596 --> 20:23.430
Finish.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.103
I, uh...

20:32.064 --> 20:34.650
I asked your mama if...

20:36.401 --> 20:38.445
if she could see her way to...

20:39.863 --> 20:41.490
making my day sweet...

20:42.908 --> 20:44.993
and my heart complete forever.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.209
That was pretty, Daddy.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.837
It was, ladybug.

20:56.588 --> 20:57.881
It really was.

21:01.718 --> 21:02.928
I love you.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.643
And what about the night in Memphis

21:09.726 --> 21:11.937
that was supposed to be the search
for the perfect barbecue?

21:12.020 --> 21:14.147
Yeah, and became the search
for the perfect bourbon.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.692
-Yeah.
-You were out of control.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.110
Just a little bit.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.612
Oh, the bartender, the--

21:20.696 --> 21:22.739
-[both] With the glass eye!
-Oh, my gosh.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.658
I know. He liked you.

21:24.741 --> 21:27.327
-Yes. [laughs]
-Oh my gosh, girl.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.293
All right, something's up.

21:36.920 --> 21:37.754
[clears throat]

21:37.838 --> 21:38.672
Tell me.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.048
Micah.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.719
It's my brother Joel. He's sick.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.096
Uh, kidney disease.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.515
[sighs]

21:49.224 --> 21:50.684
Micah, I'm so sorry.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.269
Yeah, I know.

21:53.103 --> 21:57.524
I mean, he has a wife, two kids,
no health insurance, and too sick to work.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.862
Is there anything I can do?

22:02.696 --> 22:04.072
Actually, there is.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.491
Buy me out so I can help them.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.582
-[stammers] Absolutely.
-Thank you.

22:14.207 --> 22:17.085
Yeah... [stammers] ...we'll figure it out.

22:17.753 --> 22:18.837
-[Micah] Thank you.
-Yeah.

22:19.921 --> 22:20.839
Um...

22:22.132 --> 22:25.927
Uh, Erik made his famous brownies
and ice cream before he left,

22:26.011 --> 22:28.930
and looks like you're about to have
the best dessert of your life.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.515
-Yeah.
-[both laugh]

22:36.563 --> 22:38.357
[bell ringing]

22:41.360 --> 22:43.236
[Simon] Annie. Annie!

22:43.904 --> 22:46.031
Hey, you left this
in the newspaper office.

22:46.114 --> 22:48.617
-Thank you so much.
-You must have a lot on your mind.

22:48.700 --> 22:52.245
May we please do an exposé
on the cheesiness of prom-posals?

22:53.163 --> 22:53.997
I agree.

22:54.414 --> 22:56.124
Putting on a show is unnecessary.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.418
-Direct and sincere is the way to go.
-Truth.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.421
Here's how you ask someone to prom:

23:02.130 --> 23:04.091
"Annie, I really like you.

23:04.174 --> 23:07.010
I know it's the eleventh hour,
but will you go to prom with me?"

23:07.094 --> 23:08.970
Like that. Yes.
You don't need all of the--

23:09.054 --> 23:10.180
Annie?

23:11.348 --> 23:12.349
I really like you.

23:13.141 --> 23:16.269
I know it's the eleventh hour,
but will you go to prom with me?

23:20.732 --> 23:22.692
Yeah, that'd be great.

23:24.820 --> 23:25.821
[Annie chuckles]

23:34.579 --> 23:36.998
[Maddie] I'm so sorry for Joel, for Micah,

23:37.749 --> 23:39.876
-for you.
-[Dana Sue] Thanks.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.421
[Helen] If he'd come before
we sank everything into the spa,

23:42.504 --> 23:44.506
-this would be a different story.
-[Dana Sue] Yeah.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.174
A much simpler one.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.134
I know.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.302
I mean...

23:50.637 --> 23:52.806
I need to do this for him.

23:53.974 --> 23:54.808
But...

23:55.725 --> 23:56.768
how? [chuckles]

23:56.852 --> 23:57.978
We'll figure it out.

23:59.521 --> 24:00.605
We'll figure it out.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.193
We <i>will </i>save Sullivan's.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.029
Yeah.

24:12.492 --> 24:14.327
[video game sounds]

24:14.953 --> 24:17.622
[Annie]
Hey, your mom said you'd be in here.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.916
Where else would I be? [laughs]

24:20.250 --> 24:22.169
Oh,
and speaking of being grounded forever,

24:22.252 --> 24:25.213
check out this new game I ordered
for our anti-prom night celebration.

24:26.756 --> 24:29.426
I'm... I'm so sorry, Kyle.
Can we reschedule?

24:29.885 --> 24:32.095
-The thing is--
-You're going to prom.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.306
I know you think
the whole thing is stupid,

24:34.389 --> 24:37.476
but my mom's been easing up on things
since I rocked mock trial

24:37.559 --> 24:40.103
-and Simon--
-Simon's a great guy.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.730
You'll have a great time.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.941
I'm happy for you. [chuckles]

24:46.359 --> 24:47.861
We'll play it next Margarita Night.

24:50.113 --> 24:51.156
You're the best, Kyle.

24:52.115 --> 24:52.949
Thanks.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.312
Peggy.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.898
So Ryan left... again.

25:25.315 --> 25:28.568
And what makes you think
that I would discuss that with you?

25:28.652 --> 25:31.655
My readers need to know
what's gonna happen to Benji's farm

25:31.738 --> 25:32.781
now that Ryan's gone.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.407
On or off the record?

25:34.491 --> 25:35.700
Which is the better story?

25:35.784 --> 25:38.370
<i>On </i>the record,
Ryan's presence or lack thereof

25:38.453 --> 25:41.706
has no impact on the development plans
for Benji's farm.

25:41.790 --> 25:42.791
And off?

25:42.874 --> 25:44.876
-What is wrong with you?
-I'm chasing a story.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.753
You are reveling in my pain.

25:48.505 --> 25:49.881
On the contrary, Helen.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.550
I know your pain.

25:52.676 --> 25:55.470
Serenity giveth and Serenity taketh away.

25:59.224 --> 26:02.102
I wish I could say that I know
what we're talking about here, Peggy.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.981
If we'd have been friends,

26:07.941 --> 26:08.817
you'd know.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.246
You're still tensing up, Gabe.

26:21.329 --> 26:23.039
You've got to trust yourself more.

26:23.456 --> 26:25.750
What are you thinking
when you're about to catch a pop-up?

26:25.834 --> 26:27.377
"What's gonna happen if I miss?"

26:27.460 --> 26:30.338
No. You gotta be thinking,
"I've got this."

26:31.256 --> 26:33.383
But my dad says, "Don't be overconfident."

26:38.513 --> 26:42.267
So just be the right amount of confident.
Come on. You got this.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.149
Welcome to the Corner Spa.

26:49.524 --> 26:50.609
[chuckles] Thank you.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.360
Hi. Oh!

26:52.444 --> 26:55.572
Hey! The Braves, Mom. The Braves.

26:55.655 --> 26:58.116
-I thought it was the Dodgers.
-They aren't scouting me.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.492
Wait, what?

26:59.576 --> 27:00.952
The Braves are scouting me.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.537
I'm not gonna have to worry about
going to college.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.497
I'm gonna get into the Braves' system
and just...

27:04.581 --> 27:07.083
Okay, ho-- hold your horses.
What? I don't understand.

27:07.167 --> 27:09.210
Okay, so this guy
came to practice, all right,

27:09.294 --> 27:10.378
and he's a scout for the Braves.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.963
And he says he's been watching me,

27:12.047 --> 27:14.507
and he thinks that I have a great arm
and a great future.

27:14.591 --> 27:17.177
Yes, you do. But you also know that--

27:17.260 --> 27:20.305
Don't spoil this.
Coach said he is for real.

27:21.264 --> 27:22.182
Coach Cal?

27:22.265 --> 27:24.893
Yeah, he said Johnny's a good guy
with a great eye for talent.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.519
Wait, wait, wait. [chuckles]

27:27.103 --> 27:29.981
The scout is Cal's friend Johnny?

27:30.523 --> 27:32.192
So, he's talked to you about him?

27:33.318 --> 27:36.905
Yeah, he has, just, well,
that his friend Johnny was coming to town

27:36.988 --> 27:39.282
and that he wanted us to have dinner.

27:40.158 --> 27:42.911
Yes. Okay. This is perfect.
Okay, so when are you having dinner?

27:45.163 --> 27:46.373
I don't know that we will, Ty.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.293
Why are you raining on me?

27:51.127 --> 27:55.006
Because I don't appreciate how all of this
is being handled, by anyone.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.050
Tyler, look, I am your biggest fan,

27:57.133 --> 27:59.636
but you know that I want you
to go to college before you play.

27:59.719 --> 28:00.762
You're just like Dad.

28:02.972 --> 28:05.642
You always complain
how he always has to control everyone.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.602
Thanks for picking up where he left off.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.572
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.704
[Katie laughs]

28:26.663 --> 28:27.622
[Katie laughs]

28:27.706 --> 28:29.416
I guess Katie likes that show.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.001
Katie likes to laugh.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.464
Kyle, look, um...

28:39.259 --> 28:41.594
I've been meaning to talk to you,
'cause, uh...

28:42.512 --> 28:43.722
Well, I know that...

28:44.347 --> 28:48.101
I've never gotten into
the things that you're into

28:48.184 --> 28:50.729
the way I did with Tyler
and baseball, and...

28:51.604 --> 28:52.605
that was wrong.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.067
I'm sorry.

28:58.528 --> 28:59.362
Heck,

28:59.779 --> 29:03.116
I should have studied
that Shakespeare thing the way Noreen did.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.457
So I talked to your mom,

29:11.082 --> 29:14.669
'cause I'm hoping that you and me

29:15.628 --> 29:18.173
-can do something special.
-I appreciate it, Dad,

29:18.256 --> 29:19.632
but baseball and I don't--

29:29.809 --> 29:31.603
<i>Hamilton?</i> Are these real?

29:32.437 --> 29:33.480
You bet.

29:34.689 --> 29:35.899
We'll drive to Charlotte.

29:35.982 --> 29:38.818
We'll make it a guys' weekend.
Just the two of us.

29:42.447 --> 29:43.698
W-- Why are you doing this?

29:44.741 --> 29:45.950
You don't like theater

29:46.034 --> 29:48.036
and you don't know anything
about musicals.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.288
Teach me, son.

29:52.957 --> 29:54.626
Isaac, you're never gonna believe this.

29:54.709 --> 29:56.711
Hey, Kyle. How's it... How's it going?

29:56.795 --> 30:00.131
Great. My dad is taking me to Charlotte
to see <i>Hamilton!</i>

30:00.215 --> 30:02.008
What? So jealous.

30:02.091 --> 30:03.176
-Congratulations.
-[Kyle] Yeah.

30:03.259 --> 30:05.595
This is the most exciting thing
that's happened in...

30:06.429 --> 30:07.347
I-- I don't know.

30:07.430 --> 30:08.890
More exciting than prom?

30:08.973 --> 30:12.602
-[sighs] Come on, Isaac.
-Prom's for upperclassmen. We're freshmen.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.896
Of course. [chuckles] Sorry.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.486
[mouthing]

30:23.112 --> 30:24.531
But, hey, uh,

30:24.614 --> 30:27.992
since Jackson and all his lame friends
are going to prom,

30:28.076 --> 30:30.620
I'll have total control of
every gaming console you can think of

30:30.703 --> 30:32.580
and a 65-inch flat-screen.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.623
Whoa.

30:33.706 --> 30:35.124
Wanna come over Saturday night?

30:35.792 --> 30:36.960
Uh...

30:37.043 --> 30:39.671
-[mouths] Yes.
-Uh, absolutely!

30:39.754 --> 30:41.965
I mean, there are some details
about being pretty grounded

30:42.048 --> 30:44.592
I'll have to work out with my mom,
but that'd be cool.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.095
I even have a new game I can bring over.

30:47.637 --> 30:48.638
Wonderful.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.306
[both chuckle]

30:51.057 --> 30:52.392
-[Nellie] Thank you.
-Yeah.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.734
[Maddie] I told myself

31:01.818 --> 31:04.320
that I needed a day
to just think this through

31:04.404 --> 31:08.157
and that I would be calm
and cool and reasonable,

31:08.241 --> 31:12.120
but what in the devil were you thinking
putting me in a position like that?

31:12.203 --> 31:14.664
I-- I didn't put you in any position.

31:14.747 --> 31:16.749
You didn't explain who Johnny was.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.960
Yes, I did. He's an old friend.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.253
He's a scout!

31:21.045 --> 31:22.505
Not why I wanted you to meet him.

31:22.589 --> 31:25.425
But you let him meet Ty.
You let him talk to Ty.

31:25.508 --> 31:29.137
You let him fill Ty's head
with crazy nonsense

31:29.220 --> 31:31.097
without talking to me first!

31:31.180 --> 31:32.682
The scouts
never talk to the parents first.

31:32.765 --> 31:33.766
Why not?

31:36.352 --> 31:39.898
I have every right to be upset
right now, Cal.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.984
Listen, I'm sorry that Ty got carried away
and leaped to some big conclusions,

31:43.067 --> 31:44.444
but how is any of this my fault?

31:48.907 --> 31:52.285
You do not get to make decisions
for my kid. Or for me.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.912
No, I've gone out of my way not to.

31:54.954 --> 31:56.164
I think you need to leave.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.585
Yeah. I think you're right.

32:08.176 --> 32:09.052
[door closes]

32:12.555 --> 32:13.556
Sweetheart,

32:14.724 --> 32:17.685
I hate to be the one,
but I have to say it.

32:17.769 --> 32:21.147
We've looked at this situation with Micah
six ways from Sunday,

32:21.230 --> 32:24.359
and there is only one answer.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.904
A small business loan.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.283
You know what you have to do.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.160
Oh, God help me, I do.

32:36.037 --> 32:36.913
Okay.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.290
Fine. I will...

32:40.208 --> 32:41.709
make the call.

32:45.421 --> 32:46.547
Honey, what happened?

32:48.424 --> 32:49.425
[sighs]

32:50.468 --> 32:52.428
It's gonna be a two-Margarita-Night week.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.472
-Oh, come on.
-Oh, no.

32:54.555 --> 32:55.598
[Helen] Maddie.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.266
-Mmm.
-[sighs]

33:04.816 --> 33:07.151
-Coach, Johnny said I have a future!
-And you do.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.612
But that was an informed opinion,
not an offer.

33:10.238 --> 33:13.199
Scouting is a lengthy process,
and there are no guarantees.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.535
Okay, so what am I supposed to do?
Just sit here and wait?

33:15.618 --> 33:19.038
No, you keep your head in school
and on the team.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.456
Lead us to State.

33:21.749 --> 33:23.042
Oh, she put you up to this, didn't she?

33:23.126 --> 33:25.545
No, she did not.
She doesn't even know I'm talking to you.

33:25.628 --> 33:27.547
-Okay, yeah, right.
-Ty, I've been where you are,

33:27.630 --> 33:29.841
and I need you to understand
the reality of the situation.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.843
No, Coach! I understand just fine!

33:31.926 --> 33:34.303
That I can't trust any man
that's in my mom's life!

33:35.596 --> 33:36.681
[exhales]

33:43.146 --> 33:43.980
[Isaac] Wow.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.440
I know, right?

33:45.523 --> 33:47.150
How do you make these so amazing?

33:47.233 --> 33:50.153
Wept and prayed
and let the Carolina rain do the rest.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.237
Beauty of organic farming.

33:51.946 --> 33:55.366
-I'm also pretty sure he's magic.
-Could be you bring that out in me.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.659
[both laugh]

33:57.368 --> 33:58.911
If you guys like the strawberries,

33:58.995 --> 34:01.330
wait until you take a bite
out of one of these plums.

34:01.789 --> 34:02.665
Mm.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.083
-[Ronnie clears throat]
-Thank you.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.001
Excuse me.

34:05.084 --> 34:06.335
-May I help you?
-Daddy!

34:06.836 --> 34:10.214
-[Annie laughs]
-Hey! Oh, there's my girl.

34:10.298 --> 34:12.258
-[Annie] I missed you.
-Oh, I missed you too.

34:12.341 --> 34:13.843
-How are you? You look great.
-Good.

34:13.926 --> 34:17.388
Ronnie, we said
we would talk this weekend.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.682
Yeah. Well, it's, uh... You know,

34:19.766 --> 34:22.226
it seemed like the kind of talk
we want to have in the flesh.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.394
-But--
-[kiss]

34:23.770 --> 34:24.854
[Dana Sue clears throat]

34:24.937 --> 34:26.064
Uh, Isaac,

34:26.814 --> 34:27.982
Jeremy, this is--

34:28.066 --> 34:29.275
-Ronnie.
-Jeremy.

34:29.358 --> 34:30.193
Nice to meet you.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.694
Isaac.

34:31.778 --> 34:32.612
Pleasure.

34:33.321 --> 34:36.532
Daddy, are you gonna be here all weekend?
You'll get to see me in my prom dress.

34:36.616 --> 34:39.494
Ooh. I can't wait, and I want you
to tell me all about it, baby girl.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.456
This... [sighs] ...looks delicious.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.459
[Ronnie] So, this dress.

34:46.542 --> 34:47.668
Is it...

34:48.336 --> 34:49.921
I have a complicated past.

34:50.004 --> 34:51.047
[Jeremy chuckles]

35:01.682 --> 35:03.643
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

35:07.688 --> 35:08.648
Here you go.

35:08.731 --> 35:09.941
Oh, thank you.

35:10.775 --> 35:11.609
Wow.

35:13.528 --> 35:16.197
When, uh...
When did you give up à la mode?

35:18.032 --> 35:19.408
I'm just watching my sugar.

35:19.826 --> 35:20.660
Oh.

35:21.953 --> 35:22.829
Me too.

35:26.040 --> 35:26.916
[chuckles]

35:29.001 --> 35:31.420
Uh, listen,
I-- I do appreciate you coming.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.548
Well, I mean,

35:34.132 --> 35:35.967
you told me to stay away until...

35:37.218 --> 35:40.471
you said it was okay for me to come back,
which I've done,

35:41.139 --> 35:42.348
much as it's killed me.

35:42.431 --> 35:44.058
Thank you for that.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.602
But when you called
and said we needed to talk

35:46.686 --> 35:48.020
and sounded all serious,

35:48.813 --> 35:51.566
um, I figured I'd take a chance
on showing up.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.485
Well, thank you for that too.

35:55.027 --> 35:57.196
Plus getting to see baby girl
in her prom dress is...

35:57.280 --> 35:58.739
-Yeah.
-...a huge bonus.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.700
And I get to meet her date.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.619
Ronnie, leave that poor boy alone.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.079
I'm not kidding. All right?

36:05.163 --> 36:08.291
He is level-headed
and responsible and polite.

36:08.374 --> 36:10.084
What the heck does she see in him?

36:17.925 --> 36:19.635
We need to get divorced.

36:24.807 --> 36:27.476
-Why?
-So I can clean up my financials,

36:27.560 --> 36:30.021
get a small business loan
and buy out Micah.

36:35.568 --> 36:36.569
I mean...

36:37.653 --> 36:41.574
I don't know,
wouldn't it be simpler if I came back?

36:42.283 --> 36:44.702
You know, I can help you with the money,

36:45.620 --> 36:47.955
help you at the restaurant,
do whatever you need done.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.373
That's not the answer.

36:56.672 --> 36:58.090
I've done everything right.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.427
I've played according to your rules.

do I get to come home?

37:15.316 --> 37:17.526
Okay. You'd best get back to the motel.

Well, you kids better get goin'.
You don't wanna be late.

39:17.938 --> 39:22.651
Hey, please do not let me regret
letting you take your car, okay?

39:22.735 --> 39:25.363
-I know.
-No one drinks, and no one drives but you.

39:25.446 --> 39:26.322

the molasses cookies yet.

40:12.159 --> 40:12.993
Yes, I have.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.080
Oh, you're trying to distract me
because you're jealous

40:16.163 --> 40:18.165
that I'm better with the lobber
than you are, huh?

40:18.499 --> 40:20.501
-Maybe.

40:23.212 --> 40:24.380
This is cool, Nellie.

40:24.922 --> 40:25.881

40:30.302 --> 40:32.930
You're always welcome, but, um...

40:33.639 --> 40:35.808
I wasn't expecting company.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.102
I'm not company.

40:42.231 --> 40:44.108
You and Isaac must have had quite a trip.

40:44.191 --> 40:45.276
Oh. [laughs]

40:46.652 --> 40:48.946
-'ll tell you about it later.

40:49.029 --> 40:50.072
Right now,

40:50.156 --> 40:51.740
I'm here for a special purpose.

40:51.824 --> 40:52.658
Okay.

40:55.536 --> 40:56.454
Oh, my.

40:57.037 --> 40:59.832

and they're still warm.

40:59.915 --> 41:01.041

41:01.125 --> 41:03.043
And my notorious cinnamon ice cream.

41:04.044 --> 41:05.129
A matched set.

Yeah.

41:06.714 --> 41:08.424
I am incredibly grateful

41:12.428 --> 41:14.054
pardon me if I don't quite understand.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.477
This last week has been...

41:20.936 --> 41:21.770
big.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.064
And hard,

41:24.565 --> 41:25.733
for a lot of people.

41:27.359 --> 41:29.987
And I know how much
it has to have taken out of you...

41:31.071 --> 41:32.907
to have taken care of everyone else,

41:33.908 --> 41:35.326
be strong for everyone else

41:36.285 --> 41:37.786
in the midst of your own turmoil.

41:43.584 --> 41:44.877
I wanted to lift you up a bit.

41:46.962 --> 41:48.172
I'm okay.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.424
It's okay.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.635
It's okay. It's okay.

42:09.026 --> 42:10.069
Oh!

42:10.694 --> 42:13.364
I told you, we should have used the spread
instead of the charge.

42:13.447 --> 42:15.699
[Jackson] Party people. Home sweet home!

42:15.783 --> 42:17.201
There's food here, y'all,

42:17.284 --> 42:20.579
and you'd better believe
I'm gonna get all the drinks. [laughs]

42:20.996 --> 42:23.415
This is my party, Jackson. And my food.

42:23.499 --> 42:25.251
You and your stupid friends
go somewhere else.

42:25.334 --> 42:27.127
Nope. This is the prom after-party now.

42:27.211 --> 42:30.756
So, you can go on, get out of here.
Go to the sunroom or something.

42:30.839 --> 42:32.716
[Nellie] No. We were here first.

42:32.800 --> 42:33.968
Okay, have it your way.

In the bowl! In the bowl!

42:38.430 --> 42:39.974
You know how we do it.

42:40.933 --> 42:43.477
Hey, uh, especially you, Annie.

43:03.872 --> 43:04.790
Come on.

43:08.210 --> 43:10.546
I know how to host a party, my friends.

43:10.629 --> 43:12.631
Can I give anybody a cookie?

43:12.715 --> 43:14.758
Please, get your cookies here.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.975
What are you still doing here,
and all by yourself?

43:23.058 --> 43:25.728
Erik had an errand to run,
so I told him I could lock up.

43:27.855 --> 43:28.689
What?

43:29.106 --> 43:31.025
[sighs] You know...

43:33.193 --> 43:35.946
you've done such a fine job
of stepping up here,

43:36.739 --> 43:38.324
and carving out your place.

43:38.907 --> 43:41.368
You really do give it your all,
and then some.

43:41.452 --> 43:43.954
And I don't know
if I've taken the time to tell you

43:44.038 --> 43:45.456
how much I appreciate that.

43:47.875 --> 43:48.834

I just...

43:56.925 --> 43:58.052
I'll do anything...

43:59.720 --> 44:01.555
to help you, to help Sullivan's.

44:03.349 --> 44:06.894
This kitchen is the first place
that I've ever felt

44:07.561 --> 44:08.854
completely accepted.

44:10.689 --> 44:12.274
And you're the main reason why.

44:14.318 --> 44:16.654
You are one of the most important people
in my life.

44:19.531 --> 44:21.200
Well, goodness, you're too kind.

44:21.909 --> 44:22.826
I mean it.

44:28.540 --> 44:29.792
Aren't you my mother?

44:33.504 --> 44:34.922
Listen, um...

44:36.048 --> 44:37.257
I don't deserve

44:38.258 --> 44:40.594
the compassion you've shown me of late,

44:40.678 --> 44:41.804
and, um...

44:42.638 --> 44:46.016
and I really appreciate your helping me
reconnect with the kids.

44:47.476 --> 44:50.437
Thank you
from the bottom of my heart, all right?

44:50.521 --> 44:51.563
You're welcome.
