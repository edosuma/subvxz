semifinals is --

16:09.189 --> 16:22.435
both of you!

16:22.435 --> 16:23.820
I got scared for a minute.

16:23.820 --> 16:27.640
I got scared for a minute.

16:27.640 --> 16:31.678
Congrats.
Congrats.

16:31.678 --> 16:35.548

16:35.548 --> 16:38.551
How's it feel?
>> Amazing.

16:38.551 --> 16:43.923
You both had everyone
up on their seats, standing up.

16:43.923 --> 16:47.794
Clapping for you guy right now.
Already an amazing night.

16:47.794 --> 16:50.129
Simon, both singers on the stage
last night.

16:50.129 --> 16:53.766
- What is your advice to them.
- Are you talking to me?

16:53.766 --> 16:53.820
I think I'm having a heart
attack.

16:53.820 --> 16:56.603
I think I'm having a heart
attack.

16:56.603 --> 16:58.905
What is my advice.
I really thought for a moment

16:58.905 --> 17:02.108
one of them was going to go.
It would have been so bad.

17:02.108 --> 17:06.379
This is my advice.
Stay true to to who you are as

17:06.379 --> 17:07.347
artists.
Always better yourself.

17:07.347 --> 17:09.249
Come up with something we
haven't heard before.

17:09.249 --> 17:11.885
Put your stamp on whatever you
are going to do next.

17:11.885 --> 17:15.388
It is your song.
And both of you,

17:15.388 --> 17:16.489
congratulations.

17:16.489 --> 17:19.325
All right.
Well we'll see both oaf them in

17:19.325 --> 17:23.820
the semifinals.
Keep it going for them.

17:23.820 --> 17:27.267
The semifinals.
Keep it going for them.

17:27.267 --> 17:31.471
Five acts are still waiting.

17:31.471 --> 17:34.874
Remember, backstage we got three
more acts in real danger of

17:34.874 --> 17:38.544
going home tonight.
But you can save one of them by

17:38.544 --> 17:40.246
voting now.
The infaux is on your screen.

17:40.246 --> 17:43.650
So get to it.
Keep someone's dream alive.

17:43.650 --> 17:44.206
Coming up, more results and two
of our biggest acts, ever, make

17:59.295 --> 18:01.197

18:01.197 --> 18:04.133
These are the three dunkin save
acts.

18:04.133 --> 18:07.570
There are still 14 minutes left
for you to put one of these acts

18:07.570 --> 18:11.741
into the semifinals with the
dunkin 'save.

18:11.741 --> 18:15.812
Really intense to get to it.
The prize includes headlining a

18:15.812 --> 18:19.282
show in las Vegas.
And agt winners have been taking

18:19.282 --> 18:22.518
Vegas by storm.
The minute an act wins the show,

18:22.518 --> 18:23.606
their life changes.
Take a look.

18:23.606 --> 18:27.590
Their life changes.
Take a look.

18:27.590 --> 18:32.495

18:43.072 --> 18:44.607
>> Nick Cannon opens up the card
to read the name of the winner.

18:44.607 --> 18:47.377
I tried to give a little peek,
you know?

18:47.377 --> 18:50.246
I couldn't really see anything.
>> On the very last episode.

18:50.246 --> 18:52.615
I wanted to get an iPhone really
bad.

18:52.615 --> 18:53.606
They had just come out.
2007.

18:53.606 --> 18:54.317
They had just come out.
2007.

18:54.317 --> 18:59.322
And I said, you know, even I
don't win I thought that was a

18:59.322 --> 19:01.924
million dollar performance and I
went out and bought an iPhone

19:01.924 --> 19:03.726
that day.
>> You're standing there.

19:03.726 --> 19:11.834
A horrible, horrible waiting
process

19:11.834 --> 19:12.769
- process.
- Paul zerdin.

19:12.769 --> 19:17.607
>> Boy, you just get blasted
into another planet.

19:17.607 --> 19:23.479
>> All the way to the finals
and --

19:23.479 --> 19:23.606
went down in flames.
>> So great to be sharing the

19:23.606 --> 19:27.817
went down in flames.
>> So great to be sharing the

19:27.817 --> 19:31.487
las Vegas trip with so many
people from my agt family.

19:31.487 --> 19:33.656
>> Before "America's got talent"
it was really just a challenge

19:33.656 --> 19:38.861
to be able to make ends meet and
to be able to eat lunch that

19:38.861 --> 19:41.197
day.
>> I was performing for

19:41.197 --> 19:42.732
elementary schools and county
fairs.

19:42.732 --> 19:47.837
I was an annoying geeky
ventriloquist coming up to you

19:47.837 --> 19:52.108
at dinner for two saying "hello,
would you like the pick a card."

19:52.108 --> 19:53.606
I remember having an ashtray
thrown at me once.

19:53.606 --> 19:55.178
I remember having an ashtray
thrown at me once.

19:55.178 --> 20:04.153
And waiting at and a bus can
David Copperfield goes one way

20:04.153 --> 20:07.056
and I was there going the other
way.

20:07.056 --> 20:11.394
Crazy.
>> Do dreams come true?

20:11.394 --> 20:16.032
-- Now I've got my face on a
black Jack trebill.

20:16.032 --> 20:18.868
>> I met Nancy reaganen before
she passed away.

20:18.868 --> 20:23.606
And I walked up to her and I
said Mrs. Reagan, I just want

20:23.606 --> 20:24.307
and I walked up to her and I
said Mrs. Reagan, I just want

20:24.307 --> 20:26.743
you to know, I voted for your
husband.

20:26.743 --> 20:31.848
And she said I voted for you.
It's unbelievable.

20:31.848 --> 20:33.316
>> This is so weird.
Look at this.

20:33.316 --> 20:38.588
A ticket with my name on it.
It's bizarre.

20:38.588 --> 20:40.957
Every day wake up and I look
forward to my job.

20:40.957 --> 20:43.960
I feel like living proof that
the American dream is very much

20:43.960 --> 20:48.231
still alive.
>> Never in a million years

20:48.231 --> 20:53.606
dreamed they would end up with
my own theater, the Terry fator

20:53.606 --> 20:55.171
dreamed they would end up with
my own theater, the Terry fator

20:55.171 --> 20:57.473
theater and I would be a major
head liner.

20:57.473 --> 21:01.677
Do dreams happy?
Of course dreams happy for me.

21:01.677 --> 21:05.014
Absolutely.
>> I'll try not to mess this up.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.682
>> "America's got talent" is
definitely the best thing that's

21:06.682 --> 21:22.465
ever happened to me.

21:22.465 --> 21:23.606
Just like those
champions, this season's winner

Just ask this guy.
He was the first magician to win

just ask this guy.
He was the first magician to win

26:17.082 --> 26:19.585

then, he's had his own TV

26:19.585 --> 26:24.790

headlining a spectacular show in

26:24.790 --> 26:25.991

by dream show in las Vegas.
But since I was a little kid I

the world -- pure sleight of
hand manipulation.

27:15.844 --> 27:26.919

And it is all up to the people
at the judges' desk.

38:11.466 --> 38:13.735
Judges, please consider your
decision.

38:13.735 --> 38:18.072
After the break one dream stays
alive, but for one it's all

38:18.072 --> 38:19.641

39:38.623 --> 39:40.124
Back to this week's results.
Six acts have already made it

39:40.124 --> 39:44.329
through.
We are down to the last two.

39:44.329 --> 39:46.064
Deadly games and hara.
But only one of them can

39:46.064 --> 39:48.433
- survive.
- Judges, the decision is

39:48.433 --> 39:54.272
yours.
Heidi, who do you want to put

39:54.272 --> 39:57.906
- through to the semifinals?
- See the problem is, is

39:57.906 --> 40:01.513
- through to the semifinals?
- See the problem is, is

40:01.513 --> 40:03.915
that I'm a fan of both of these
acts.

40:03.915 --> 40:07.919
I love both of you guys.
Hara what you did last nigh was

40:07.919 --> 40:10.655
fantastic.
I think you are an amazing

40:10.655 --> 40:13.024
magician.
And you two I can watch over and

40:13.024 --> 40:15.860
over and over again.
It never gets old.

40:15.860 --> 40:21.399
So it is really really hard.
I just have to go with my gut

40:21.399 --> 40:25.303
feeling and I'm going choose
deadly games.

40:25.303 --> 40:27.906
One more deadly games.
Mel b.

40:27.906 --> 40:28.506
One more deadly games.
Mel b.

40:28.506 --> 40:31.342
This is hard.
Deadly games you have me

40:31.342 --> 40:34.078
screaming every time I watch
you, like oh my god.

40:34.078 --> 40:37.982
And hara you take me into your
magical mystery world and I

40:37.982 --> 40:41.152
- don't want to leave.
- What.

40:41.152 --> 40:42.954
You heard what I said
Simon.

40:42.954 --> 40:50.128
Now I have to decide.
I am going to go with hara.

40:50.128 --> 40:51.029
Simon.

40:51.029 --> 40:53.865
I watched both of your
acts back last night.

40:53.865 --> 40:57.906
I was in bed, drinking hot
chocolate.

40:57.906 --> 40:58.603
I was in bed, drinking hot
chocolate.

40:58.603 --> 41:02.173
- All right.
- Anyway, I thought

41:02.173 --> 41:05.977
hara, you were great.
I thought deadly games

41:05.977 --> 41:10.114
genuinely, and I've done this
show for a while, it was the

41:10.114 --> 41:16.521
best act of its kind I've ever
scene

41:16.521 --> 41:18.489
seen.
That is why, I'm sorry hara, my

41:18.489 --> 41:22.193
- vote goes for deadly games.
- Howie, we need it and

41:22.193 --> 41:26.731
- need it fast.
- Need it fast?

41:26.731 --> 41:27.906
- Less than a minute.
- Why me?

41:27.906 --> 41:29.467
- Less than a minute.
- Why me?

41:29.467 --> 41:32.604
Deadly games, I agree with what
Simon said.

41:32.604 --> 41:35.106
You are amazing.
Hara, you are so magical.

41:35.106 --> 41:38.276
You are amazing.
I --

41:38.276 --> 41:41.045
you scare me.
You dazzle me.

41:41.045 --> 41:46.017
Do I go with fear?
Do I go with being dazzled?

41:46.017 --> 41:48.019
Hara.
It's hara.

41:48.019 --> 41:49.287
Hara.
Okay.

41:49.287 --> 41:52.423
So that means we have a tie.
The acts are tied.

41:52.423 --> 41:57.906
Two judges votes each.
So that means we have to go to

41:57.906 --> 41:58.096
two judges votes each.
So that means we have to go to

41:58.096 --> 42:00.798
America.
The act with the most votes from

42:00.798 --> 42:04.168
you at home last night.
Based on America's vote, the act

42:04.168 --> 42:10.708
going into the semi-finals is --
deadly games.

42:10.708 --> 42:14.812
Congratulations!

42:14.812 --> 42:19.817
Hara, you're amazing.
Thank you so much.

42:19.817 --> 42:21.052
Deadly games.
Congratulations.

42:21.052 --> 42:26.791
We have our seven semifinalists.
See you next week.

42:26.791 --> 42:27.125
Good night America.
