00:08.400 --> 00:09.992
- Lazio is going deep once again...

00:10.360 --> 00:11.475
Watch out for Lulié

00:11.960 --> 00:13.757
...How could we let this happen?

00:14.560 --> 00:15.675
How could we let this happen?

00:16.000 --> 00:16.989
How could we let this happen?

00:18.080 --> 00:19.593
Such a key game...

00:20.040 --> 00:22.076
wasted like this!

00:22.160 --> 00:23.673
What the hell?

00:23.760 --> 00:25.910
What kind of Naples' team is this?

00:26.640 --> 00:29.871
How can you possibly play
such a crucial game this way?

00:29.960 --> 00:32.110
We let them overtake us like this!

00:32.600 --> 00:34.795
We let them overtake us like this!

00:35.320 --> 00:37.072
For the second time!

00:38.360 --> 00:40.191
How could we let this happen?

00:45.880 --> 00:47.552
What a disappointment!

00:48.440 --> 00:49.873
What a disappointment!

00:52.480 --> 00:54.038
Lulié's 2-0...

00:54.240 --> 00:56.879
Just as the first half was about to end.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.673
What a disappointment!

01:01.560 --> 01:02.879
What a disappointment!

01:25.840 --> 01:26.829
- Leave us!

01:31.360 --> 01:33.112
- They'll destroy us.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.875
This losing retrograde battle
against homosexuals,

01:37.360 --> 01:40.875
especially in the glare
of that young man's suicide,

01:40.960 --> 01:42.359
will put an end to everything.

01:43.120 --> 01:48.035
It's possible to tolerate a great many things
but not a threat to one's own survival.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.480
But you told me that you gave those photos
to Sister Mary

01:54.560 --> 01:56.198
and that she had destroyed them.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.799
That's true.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.670
But first I made a copy...

02:01.840 --> 02:02.829
just in case.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.072
- What do you have in mind?

02:12.520 --> 02:13.953
- Let's give them to the press.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.232
ln fifteen days we'll have a new Pope.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.235
An adult Pope.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.429
- Who?

02:21.720 --> 02:22.789
- Spencer.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.829
Or else me.

02:26.920 --> 02:27.955
- No.

02:29.800 --> 02:30.789
- Me.

02:32.000 --> 02:32.989
- All right.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.552
l'll pull strings in the conclave like always,
and you'll be the new Pope.

02:36.960 --> 02:41.033
- And you'll be an all-powerful
Cardinal Secretary of State again.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.749
But none of that will happen.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.590
We won't use those photographs.
There won't be any scandal.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.875
- Why not?
- Because we can't show the world

02:52.960 --> 02:54.837
the image of a Pope

02:55.360 --> 02:57.920
with his hands on a young woman's breasts.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.595
It would be the lowest point ever
for the Church,

03:00.920 --> 03:03.639
that no subsequent Pope would ever
be able to recover from it.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.635
You're forgetting something.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.033
- Having fun, Aldo?

17:18.280 --> 17:19.508
- Yeah, I guess...

20:07.960 --> 20:09.791
- Ludovico, we'd like to go to bed.

20:10.280 --> 20:11.269
Would you do us a favor?

20:11.400 --> 20:13.550
Get his crucifix
and take him back to the Vatican.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.479
- I'll take care of it, mom.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.792
- He pooped.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.399
Oh, a lot of poop!

37:59.280 --> 38:01.111
- I couldn't bring myself to do it, Caltanisetta.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.915
I couldn't have him sign his resignation.

42:30.040 --> 42:32.315
- Hello Rome!

42:38.120 --> 42:40.156
Greetings.

42:42.440 --> 42:44.317
Thank you so much...

42:45.400 --> 42:46.674
Thank you.
