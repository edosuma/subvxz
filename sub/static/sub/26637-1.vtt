00:15.333 --> 00:17.709
- Look at us.
- Who would've thought, right?

02:32.041 --> 02:34.291
No, no. She's the cover.
She's the cover.

02:34.375 --> 02:35.834
Everyone else is doing this.

02:35.917 --> 02:37.250
You wanted to see me?

02:37.333 --> 02:38.917
- But you've got...
- Photograph from...

02:44.875 --> 02:47.792
All's well on
the road to Damascus?

02:47.875 --> 02:49.000
Yes.

02:49.083 --> 02:51.000
Break really did me good.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.959
You sure?

02:58.583 --> 03:00.500
One month clean and sober.

03:00.583 --> 03:03.125
Miracles are possible, ma'am.

03:05.792 --> 03:07.512
All right, let's see
if we can find some use

03:07.583 --> 03:10.291
for all this newfound zeal,
shall we?

03:13.375 --> 03:16.583
Now, this Gore Vidal interview?

03:16.667 --> 03:17.959
Got the questions
right here.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.125
Too soft.

03:19.208 --> 03:21.625
The boss wants his head
on a platter.

03:21.709 --> 03:23.542
He doesn't like
senile old poofs

03:23.625 --> 03:25.185
pontificating about
the decline and fall

03:25.250 --> 03:26.709
of his favorite country.

03:26.792 --> 03:28.417
His wife's a Yank, remember?

03:28.500 --> 03:31.709
But Vidal's the real thing.
He's a genius.

03:31.792 --> 03:34.291
- And?
- And so, it's a hatchet job?

03:34.375 --> 03:36.000
You call it what you like.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.625
You get it right,
it's the cover.

03:40.291 --> 03:43.750
All you have to do is string him
up in the town square.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.500
Think you can handle that?

03:49.458 --> 03:51.208
No sweat.

03:51.291 --> 03:52.709
Oh, I almost forgot.

03:52.792 --> 03:54.792
I want you to fit in
another quick little interview

03:54.834 --> 03:57.250
while you're out there.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.375
The most famous dwarf
in the world.

03:59.458 --> 04:02.625
Man with the Golden Gun.
Fantasy Island.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.542
You know,
"The plane, the plane."

04:04.625 --> 04:07.333
I thought he was dead.
Is he not?

04:07.417 --> 04:09.137
It's the 20th anniversary
of the Bond movie.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.083
Funny little story, 500 words,
"Where are they now?"

04:12.166 --> 04:14.208
I've got my hands full
already with the Vidal thing.

04:14.291 --> 04:15.959
Can you not give it
to someone else?

04:16.041 --> 04:18.458
- How about Casey?
- He's refused.

04:18.541 --> 04:20.791
I refuse.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.810
I'm sorry, weren't you
in the middle of thanking me

04:22.834 --> 04:24.000
for saving your ass?

04:25.500 --> 04:27.834
Yes, I was.

04:32.709 --> 04:35.667
Oh, and the dwarf piece?
Make it funny.

04:37.667 --> 04:40.375
All expenses to L.A.
Very nice.

04:40.458 --> 04:42.792
Well, it was only
a matter of time.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.583
You're finally going up
in the world.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.750
Oh, well, surely you mean down,
in the case of the midget.

04:47.834 --> 04:50.750
Casey, will you be joining us
for a drink later?

04:50.834 --> 04:52.583
Can't. Off first thing.

04:52.667 --> 04:56.375
One on one with Reagan,
at the ranch in Santa Barbara.

04:56.458 --> 04:58.291
- Reagan?
- Yeah.

04:58.375 --> 05:00.208
Wants to talk about
what it was like

05:00.291 --> 05:02.417
running the world,
or something.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.125
I can talk about what it was
like for the world.

05:28.166 --> 05:29.250
Oh, hi.

05:30.458 --> 05:31.583
She's out.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.250
How's Jamie?

05:34.333 --> 05:35.750
He's fine.

05:37.208 --> 05:38.917
I've just put him down.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.750
I can literally see him.

05:41.834 --> 05:44.709
Danny, goodbye.

05:44.792 --> 05:46.458
Can you at least tell me
where Katie is?

06:13.709 --> 06:15.417
Hi.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.208
What are you doing here?

06:22.291 --> 06:25.458
Basically, you know,
I was nowhere near the area,

06:25.542 --> 06:28.792
so, thought I'd pop in,
say hello.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.250
Oh, and this is for you,
by the way.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.792
I'm going to see you guys later.

06:37.792 --> 06:39.750
I was just about to buy
everyone a round.

06:41.208 --> 06:43.041
I just came to tell you
the good news.

06:43.125 --> 06:44.792
I'm back at work.

06:44.875 --> 06:46.875
And they're sending me
to L.A. for a cover story.

06:46.959 --> 06:48.208
Can you believe that?

06:48.291 --> 06:49.643
And I'm going to do it
brilliantly...

06:49.667 --> 06:51.375
And what?

06:51.458 --> 06:53.959
I'm doing it this time,
just like I said I would.

06:54.041 --> 06:55.959
You're not hearing me.
It's over!

06:57.625 --> 06:58.917
This time it's real.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.083
Look.

07:00.166 --> 07:02.583
I'm a month sober.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.834
Even if you were
telling me the truth,

07:04.917 --> 07:06.709
which, by the way,
how could I know,

07:06.792 --> 07:08.333
are you that fucking deluded

07:08.417 --> 07:10.267
that you think everything
would suddenly be okay

07:10.291 --> 07:12.667
in a couple of weeks
after what happened?

07:12.750 --> 07:14.750
After five years of your shit?

07:14.834 --> 07:17.500
Look, I'm trying!
Kate, I'm fucking trying!

07:18.792 --> 07:20.667
I'm not coming back, Danny.

07:42.875 --> 07:44.625
Belvedere.

07:44.709 --> 07:47.250
Yeah, 10:00 tomorrow night.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.417
Precisely, 10:00.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.000
I understand.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.208
Let me know
if anything changes.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.500
Oh, and will you please
tell Mr. Vidal

07:56.583 --> 07:59.333
how excited I am
to meet him?

07:59.417 --> 08:00.750
Thank you.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.792
Room service? Yeah,
could you have someone come

08:23.875 --> 08:27.000
and clear all the alcohol
out of my minibar, please?

08:27.083 --> 08:28.250
Thanks.

08:41.875 --> 08:44.375
You recall the final scene

08:44.458 --> 08:46.625
in The Man with
the Golden Gun,

08:46.709 --> 08:49.750
when Roger Moore,
he stuff me in that suitcase?

08:49.834 --> 08:52.792
He fix my back really good.

08:52.875 --> 08:55.166
I couldn't walk for a week.

08:55.250 --> 08:57.417
He persuade the girls
to carry me out

08:57.500 --> 09:00.333
by the hotel pool
on a stretcher.

09:00.417 --> 09:01.792
Like Caesar, you know?

09:01.875 --> 09:04.250
- Just like Caesar.
- Just like Caesar.

09:04.333 --> 09:07.291
Making The Man with
the Golden Gun,

09:07.375 --> 09:09.250
happiest time of my life.

09:09.333 --> 09:10.667
Let me help you with that.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.625
Voilà.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.208
Are you sure
you won't join me?

09:24.291 --> 09:26.667
- A drink, at least.
- No, thank you.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.792
I don't...

09:28.875 --> 09:30.834
You are wondering
why I only taste things.

09:30.917 --> 09:32.709
That's what you were thinking,
wasn't it?

09:32.792 --> 09:34.959
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.
What is that?

09:35.041 --> 09:37.417
It's because the damn
doctors say so.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.000
My blood is sick at my age,
with my condition,

09:41.083 --> 09:43.291
so I'm under the strictest
instruction.

09:43.375 --> 09:47.583
If I were to eat a whole meal,
I might drop dead right here.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.000
Now...

09:49.083 --> 09:50.750
now that would be a story.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.125
Yeah, it certainly would.

09:56.959 --> 09:59.333
And smoking isn't a risk?

10:00.875 --> 10:03.333
A life without risks
is not worth discussing.

10:04.583 --> 10:06.625
He make me the way he does.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.458
But he offer compensation.

10:11.542 --> 10:14.083
To eat, to feel, to touch,

10:14.166 --> 10:16.417
to, oh, make love.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.750
These are the purposes
of my life.

10:19.834 --> 10:22.500
The day I cannot
do these things is my last.

10:22.583 --> 10:26.375
So, I must fill every day
with limitless possibility.

10:26.458 --> 10:27.834
- Yes?
- Thank you.

10:27.917 --> 10:30.125
No, no!
No, you are my guest.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.542
I insist.

10:33.542 --> 10:35.792
There you go.
Oh, hello.

10:35.875 --> 10:37.333
Thank you.

10:39.041 --> 10:41.000
Well, thank you, Hervé.

10:41.083 --> 10:43.417
That was brilliant.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.542
I mean, what? What?
That's it?

10:46.625 --> 10:48.458
No more questions?

10:48.542 --> 10:49.917
I've got more than enough.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.017
Actually, I have another
interview to get to tonight.

10:52.041 --> 10:53.834
Another interview?
Tonight?

10:53.917 --> 10:55.500
Unfortunately, yeah.

10:55.583 --> 10:56.917
I'm already late.

10:58.625 --> 11:03.375
You know, I haven't given
an interview in 10 years.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.291
But when your paper called,

11:05.375 --> 11:07.041
it has quite a reputation,
you know?

11:07.125 --> 11:09.834
- Yeah, it does.
- Which is why I so surprised.

11:09.917 --> 11:11.333
Why were you surprised?

11:11.417 --> 11:14.875
They didn't used
to send the juniors.

11:19.208 --> 11:20.500
I'm not a junior.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.125
Oh, only a junior

11:22.208 --> 11:25.083
would have written the story
before they got here.

11:25.166 --> 11:27.792
Nick Nack. Tattoo.

11:27.875 --> 11:30.000
Just a silly little moment,

11:30.083 --> 11:31.893
but I'm sure that's all
someone of your stature

11:31.917 --> 11:34.083
would be interested in.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.792
That's funny.

11:35.875 --> 11:38.083
But, you know,
you should be very careful.

11:38.166 --> 11:40.542
In a few years I'm going to be
editing that paper.

11:40.625 --> 11:42.375
No, you won't.

11:43.917 --> 11:46.125
You're right about one thing.

11:46.208 --> 11:48.000
You're not the reason
they flew me out here.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.291
You're just
the amuse-bouche.

11:51.792 --> 11:53.542
Sorry, sir,
this one didn't go through.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.125
Your machine is broke.

11:59.583 --> 12:02.291
Well, Hervé, I could sit
and chat here all night,

12:02.375 --> 12:05.959
but got to get on
with this other interview.

12:07.959 --> 12:11.709
I have a real story for you,
Junior.

12:11.792 --> 12:15.792
A story that would be printed
around the world.

12:15.875 --> 12:20.291
And this story will be the one
that make your name.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.709
Really?

12:28.792 --> 12:31.417
What if I tell you

12:31.500 --> 12:36.250
you have the final interview
with Hervé Villechaize?

12:36.333 --> 12:38.125
What?

12:50.041 --> 12:51.583
Ooh, I got you!

12:53.542 --> 12:55.250
Fuck.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.333
I don't play sick games
like that.

12:57.417 --> 12:59.625
Did I get you?

13:01.625 --> 13:03.959
Hervé, thank you so much.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.834
Brilliant. Good night.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.625
Goodbye...

13:15.709 --> 13:17.041
Junior.

13:31.166 --> 13:32.959
I need to get to the Belvedere
in 10 minutes.

13:33.041 --> 13:34.601
- Can you help me?
- You got it.

13:46.083 --> 13:49.041
I am so sorry to be late,
Mr. Vidal.

13:52.125 --> 13:55.458
Had a bit of an emergency.

13:55.542 --> 13:57.458
Did someone die?

13:57.542 --> 14:00.041
I sincerely hope so.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.750
No.

14:01.834 --> 14:03.875
Long story short,
it was a dwarf.

14:09.417 --> 14:12.875
Let me just start by saying
how much I love your book.

14:12.959 --> 14:14.458
Mr. Tate,

14:14.542 --> 14:16.834
it was made clear to you that
our interview was to begin

14:16.917 --> 14:19.375
precisely at 10:00,
was it not?

14:19.458 --> 14:21.000
Yes.

14:21.083 --> 14:24.667
And you're aware it's now
23 minutes past?

14:24.750 --> 14:26.834
Yes, and I apologize.

14:26.917 --> 14:30.333
If you're incapable of accuracy
with your time-keeping,

14:30.417 --> 14:32.750
why should I expect it
from your reporting?

14:34.542 --> 14:36.625
Thank you, Saul.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.000
No. It's a mistake.

14:39.083 --> 14:41.041
Sir, it was my mistake,
and I'm sorry.

14:41.125 --> 14:42.917
Please.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.542
Please, please, please.

14:44.625 --> 14:49.500
I have traveled such a long way
to be here, sir. Please.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.875
So have I.

14:51.959 --> 14:55.125
Perhaps I can offer
you a drink, sir.

14:56.959 --> 14:59.166
Don't be a cunt.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.476
His office is open
at 10:00 a.m.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.750
He writes there
until lunchtime.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.500
I will be there
waiting for him to arrive.

15:03.583 --> 15:06.125
Look, I'm not going to leave
until I get the interview, okay?

15:06.208 --> 15:07.935
I just need you to have
my flight pushed back.

15:07.959 --> 15:09.935
Don't tell me what you'll need.

15:09.959 --> 15:12.083
The old man's going
to shit a brick.

15:12.166 --> 15:14.246
Then don't tell him until
I've got everything sorted.

15:14.291 --> 15:17.375
Christ. You stay put.
Don't do anything.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.583
Shit. You're not going
to tell him?

15:19.667 --> 15:22.125
No, I'm going to fix it
from here.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.750
Look, I promise
I'll take care of it.

15:23.834 --> 15:25.750
You promised you wouldn't
fuck it up.

15:27.625 --> 15:28.834
Fuck!

15:33.333 --> 15:34.834
Fuck!

15:50.792 --> 15:53.083
Room service? Yes, I called
and asked very nicely

15:53.166 --> 15:55.017
for you to remove
all the booze from my minibar,

15:55.041 --> 15:56.542
but it's still fucking here!

16:29.542 --> 16:31.125
Gentlemen, when it comes
to having

16:31.208 --> 16:33.083
the last word
in an argument,

16:33.166 --> 16:35.458
is it more important
to your wife...

16:35.542 --> 16:37.792
It isn't the kind of a face
you'd forget in a hurry.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.000
No.

16:39.083 --> 16:40.959
Wait a minute. I know.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.291
In some magazine.
The Atlantic, I think.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.667
Hello?

16:59.750 --> 17:01.125
Housekeeping.

17:01.208 --> 17:03.333
Who is this?

17:03.417 --> 17:04.750
Hervé!

17:04.834 --> 17:06.333
Hervé?

17:06.416 --> 17:08.083
It's the middle
of the fucking night.

17:08.165 --> 17:10.541
Your other interview
is over, yes?

17:10.625 --> 17:11.916
So?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.666
So maybe we finish
our interview now.

17:14.750 --> 17:16.625
We finished our interview.

17:16.709 --> 17:18.791
I'll meet you downstairs
in five minutes.

17:18.875 --> 17:20.290
What?

17:20.375 --> 17:23.208
I promised you a great story,
didn't I?

17:26.290 --> 17:28.458
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

18:00.625 --> 18:02.834
Twat.

18:11.625 --> 18:13.583
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

18:13.667 --> 18:16.375
I thought I'd give you
a little tour

18:16.458 --> 18:19.041
of Hervé's L.A.

18:19.125 --> 18:22.083
I thought you wanted
to finish your interview.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.750
We do it as we go.

18:27.625 --> 18:29.792
Scared?

18:44.834 --> 18:48.166
This is how to travel, no?

18:49.417 --> 18:52.458
Danny, don't worry.

18:52.542 --> 18:54.709
I'm not going to kill you.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.542
Not yet, anyway.

19:05.250 --> 19:07.917
So, how did the other
interview go?

19:09.041 --> 19:10.250
Yeah. It was good.

19:10.333 --> 19:11.625
It's fine.

19:11.709 --> 19:12.917
Not so well.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.250
All right.

19:16.333 --> 19:19.291
What is this incredible
story of yours, then?

19:19.375 --> 19:21.583
The one that's going
to make my name?

19:21.667 --> 19:23.500
You tell me.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.125
You're the writer.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.125
Ask me a question.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.083
Listen, mate,

19:31.166 --> 19:32.583
tell me what you want
to tell me,

19:32.667 --> 19:34.709
or you can drop me off
right fucking here.

19:36.959 --> 19:39.000
Good. Good.

19:39.083 --> 19:40.917
Good?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.625
Now I know
you're paying attention.

19:54.333 --> 19:58.333
My mother always used to say
I was Hitler's fault.

19:58.417 --> 20:01.291
As if he didn't have enough
to answer for.

20:37.166 --> 20:39.166
So that's what she said
caused it all?

20:39.250 --> 20:40.917
All this?

20:42.959 --> 20:45.333
You know, maybe it was
the ambulance crash

20:45.417 --> 20:47.375
that make me into what I am,

20:47.458 --> 20:49.083
or maybe it is God's will.

20:49.166 --> 20:52.333
Who knows? You know, he has
a sick sense of humor sometime.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.291
When did...

20:54.375 --> 20:56.667
when did you realize
that you were...?

20:57.834 --> 20:59.125
A freak?

21:40.208 --> 21:41.917
Bravo.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.208
Papa was a doctor.

21:44.291 --> 21:47.417
He was the first one
who noticed it.

22:13.667 --> 22:14.917
Merci.

22:17.917 --> 22:19.500
Madame?

22:19.583 --> 22:21.250
Evelyne?

22:21.333 --> 22:23.291
Madame Villechaize...

22:40.417 --> 22:44.667
My papa tell me nothing is impossible.

22:44.750 --> 22:46.500
Huh? Bravo!

22:46.583 --> 22:50.083
He become obsessed
with making me grow.

23:09.375 --> 23:13.667
He tell me we must be willing
to try anything,

23:13.750 --> 23:18.125
that a miracle
is always possible.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.250
Oui.

23:58.208 --> 24:00.417
Hey.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.083
- Ca va.
- Ca va.

24:02.166 --> 24:03.417
Hmm.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.750
Mm-hmm.

24:07.792 --> 24:09.000
Hmm?

24:15.667 --> 24:17.583
How did you endure it?

24:17.667 --> 24:19.375
What do you mean?

24:19.458 --> 24:22.125
I mean, you went
through hell for...

24:22.208 --> 24:24.166
for nothing.

24:24.250 --> 24:25.792
No, not for nothing.

24:25.875 --> 24:28.583
If we don't try everything,
Papa will always wonder

24:28.667 --> 24:31.250
if somehow he can still
make me better.

24:31.333 --> 24:34.667
If somehow
he can still make me well.

25:51.792 --> 25:53.208
Ah.

25:53.291 --> 25:55.500
Just what the doctor ordered.

25:55.583 --> 25:56.917
Oh, God.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.542
You know, I think
in her own way,

26:01.625 --> 26:05.291
my mother was always
in love with me.

26:06.959 --> 26:09.291
What on earth would
make you think that?

26:09.375 --> 26:11.834
Because she is my mother.

26:11.917 --> 26:14.375
I know how she feel.

26:14.458 --> 26:16.250
I am a constant
living reminder

26:16.333 --> 26:19.917
of the ambulance crash,
of her own weakness.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.250
Okay.

26:21.333 --> 26:24.875
What did your father
think of her behavior?

26:25.000 --> 26:28.250
He tell me,
because of my condition,

26:28.333 --> 26:31.542
that I am lucky if I live
past 25 year old.

26:33.208 --> 26:35.542
But I make it to 50.

26:37.333 --> 26:41.291
Maybe now he realize
what a miracle I am.

26:42.959 --> 26:44.333
Miracle.

26:50.625 --> 26:51.917
You like?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.375
Brilliant.

26:53.458 --> 26:55.625
It looks exactly like you.

26:55.709 --> 26:57.083
Really, you are
a great artist.

26:57.166 --> 26:59.041
That's fucking brilliant.

26:59.125 --> 27:01.542
Aww.

27:47.583 --> 27:50.583
and I am Hervé the conqueror!

27:53.041 --> 27:55.834
Sometimes, the curse
of disproportion

27:55.917 --> 27:58.458
work in a man's favor.

28:03.250 --> 28:06.375
I finally understand
what I must be:

28:06.458 --> 28:08.709
an artist.

28:13.375 --> 28:17.041
That I must find a way
to enjoy every waking moment,

28:17.125 --> 28:19.875
whatever the cost.

29:07.041 --> 29:08.041
Ah, ah, shh, shh.

29:23.834 --> 29:26.417
When the world realize
you are a real person

29:26.500 --> 29:29.500
and not just an amusing sight,

29:29.583 --> 29:31.375
they get scared.

29:32.667 --> 29:34.333
Why is that, you think?

29:35.834 --> 29:39.000
Why would people be afraid
of someone like me?

29:40.875 --> 29:42.125
I don't know.

30:11.208 --> 30:12.667
What is it?

30:12.750 --> 30:15.667
Our night is about
to improve.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.208
Driver!

30:27.083 --> 30:28.709
- Ah, Hervé!
- Hey, how are you, man?

30:28.792 --> 30:31.250
- You good?
- How's the wife and kids, huh?

30:32.709 --> 30:34.041
Perfect.

30:38.709 --> 30:40.333
Hi.

30:47.417 --> 30:48.667
Yeah.

30:55.750 --> 30:57.458
Come on. Come on.

31:03.750 --> 31:05.250
How are you?

31:05.333 --> 31:07.166
Hervé, I told you
I don't drink.

31:07.250 --> 31:08.333
Huh.

31:08.417 --> 31:09.917
Who's going to know?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.667
It's just you and me.

31:11.750 --> 31:13.208
How long's it been?

31:13.291 --> 31:15.500
- What?
- "What." Come on.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.542
Danny, we're friends now.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.166
You can tell me.

31:19.250 --> 31:20.930
Not that it's any
of your fucking business,

31:21.000 --> 31:22.166
but it's been 32 days.

31:22.250 --> 31:23.417
Thirty-two days?
That is all?

31:23.500 --> 31:25.458
Sounds bad.

31:25.542 --> 31:27.434
You think that sounds bad?
That's actually really good.

31:27.458 --> 31:30.083
Who would count the days
if it was good?

31:30.166 --> 31:32.166
Now that you've got my story,

31:32.250 --> 31:33.792
why don't we continue
with yours?

31:37.291 --> 31:39.166
Okay. The night of the attack.

31:39.250 --> 31:41.834
It was decided
that I must leave France.

31:41.917 --> 31:44.959
When you are a freak,
you go where the freaks go.

31:46.583 --> 31:50.166
New York City is the only
place I ever feel tall.

32:00.959 --> 32:03.250
You want that gun?
Pick it up.

32:03.333 --> 32:05.667
You want that gun? Pick it up.

32:05.750 --> 32:06.917
I wish you would.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.208
I wish you would.

32:11.417 --> 32:13.417
For two months, I sit and eat

32:13.500 --> 32:16.458
and watch John Wayne,
Chuck Heston,

32:16.542 --> 32:18.875
Steve McQueen, Gilligan.

32:18.959 --> 32:20.917
All the greats.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.250
That's how I learned
to speak English.

32:23.333 --> 32:25.834
That's earning
money the hard way.

32:25.917 --> 32:29.083
I realize there is fantasy

32:29.166 --> 32:30.375
in everyone's living room.

32:30.458 --> 32:33.333
And I must be a part of it.

32:33.417 --> 32:35.333
This new world,
the world of television.

32:35.417 --> 32:38.583
And nobody run in here either, huh?

32:38.667 --> 32:41.875
That's when I see who
Hervé Villechaize can become.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.959
An artist who everyone know.

32:44.041 --> 32:45.291
Like Dali.

32:45.375 --> 32:48.375
An artist who himself
become a work of art.

32:48.458 --> 32:50.917
Why paint it
when you can be it?

32:51.000 --> 32:53.434
So that's the moment you decided
that you wanted to be famous?

32:53.458 --> 32:55.083
No! When I must be famous.

32:55.166 --> 32:58.417
Like you must be the editor.
It is a calling.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.834
I can't tell you how proud we
are to be part of this, Sydney.

33:01.917 --> 33:03.250
No...

33:03.333 --> 33:04.875
Can you hold on a second?

33:04.959 --> 33:06.125
What is it?

33:06.208 --> 33:07.834
There's a little French guy

33:07.917 --> 33:09.959
in reception
with a knife.

33:10.041 --> 33:11.208
A what?

33:11.291 --> 33:13.125
He says he wants
to talk to you.

33:13.208 --> 33:16.875
I just need five minute
of your time, Mr. Rothstein.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.500
Everything's fine, Melanie.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.500
How can I help you, Mr...?

33:25.583 --> 33:28.417
My name is Hervé Villechaize.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.959
I am the best French actor
of this generation.

33:32.041 --> 33:35.917
And I need the best agent
of this generation

33:36.000 --> 33:37.375
to represent me.

33:37.458 --> 33:39.625
You are the best, no?

33:39.709 --> 33:43.375
Can you put the knife down,
please?

33:43.458 --> 33:45.125
Tomorrow...

33:45.208 --> 33:48.000
and tomorrow...

33:48.083 --> 33:50.291
and tomorrow

33:50.375 --> 33:52.500
creeps in this petty pace

33:52.583 --> 33:54.834
from day to day,

33:54.917 --> 33:59.083
to the last syllable
of recorded time.

34:00.583 --> 34:03.000
And all our yesterdays

34:03.083 --> 34:06.583
have lighted fools
the way to dusty death.

34:08.291 --> 34:11.000
Out, out, brief candle!

34:13.833 --> 34:16.542
Life is but a walking shadow,

34:16.625 --> 34:20.833
a poor player that struts

34:20.917 --> 34:23.041
and frets his hour
upon the stage,

34:23.125 --> 34:25.542
and then is heard no more.

34:25.625 --> 34:30.875
It is a tale
told by an idiot,

34:30.958 --> 34:33.833
full of sound and fury,

34:33.917 --> 34:35.500
signifying nothing.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.500
Jesus fucking Christ.

34:49.208 --> 34:50.583
And that was that.

34:50.667 --> 34:53.583
I decided to become
a movie star.

34:53.667 --> 34:57.417
You don't just decide
to become a movie star.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.959
Just because a man is small

34:59.041 --> 35:01.125
doesn't mean
he has to act it.

35:03.667 --> 35:05.250
James Bond.

35:05.333 --> 35:06.750
He saved my life.

35:06.834 --> 35:08.750
Nick Nack...

35:08.834 --> 35:10.250
pleasure to meet you.

35:10.333 --> 35:11.917
Sit down.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.583
Watch them.

35:13.667 --> 35:16.000
And find your mark.
Find your mark.

35:17.208 --> 35:18.417
See, this is what happens

35:18.500 --> 35:20.625
when people forget
how lucky they are.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.166
You don't never have
to worry about me, Roger.

35:25.250 --> 35:27.000
It is then that I discover

35:27.083 --> 35:29.709
there is a divine cure
for my condition.

35:29.792 --> 35:33.250
And by divine cure,
you mean success?

35:33.333 --> 35:36.417
No. I mean success.

36:14.709 --> 36:18.917
Finally, I realize
my mother is proud of me.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.291
Proud of her little man.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.208
Still, to this day,

36:34.291 --> 36:38.208
it is one of the greatest
moment of my life.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.375
You know what I think?

36:43.458 --> 36:45.750
I think we worked well.

36:45.834 --> 36:48.667
I think we deserve

36:48.750 --> 36:51.875
a big, fat treat, on me.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.709
- Hi.
- Uh-oh.

36:53.792 --> 36:56.041
I'm Destiny.

36:56.125 --> 36:58.085
- This is my friend Brianne.
- Where's your phone?

36:58.125 --> 36:59.417
Danny, come on.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.917
Don't call your mother now,
Danny.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.959
Hello, Destiny.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.333
Hello, Brianne.

37:13.375 --> 37:15.417
Yeah, Room 1007?

37:16.792 --> 37:18.041
Yeah, Mr. Tate.

37:18.125 --> 37:19.583
Do I have any messages?

37:21.959 --> 37:23.917
Okay. Thanks.

37:45.417 --> 37:46.834
Hervé, I'm going home.

37:46.917 --> 37:48.834
We'll pick this up
some other time.

37:50.333 --> 37:52.333
Don't let him leave.

37:54.083 --> 37:55.583
You Englishmen.

37:55.667 --> 37:58.250
You just don't know
how to have a good time.

37:58.333 --> 38:00.875
I'm Irish,
and I assure you we do.

38:00.959 --> 38:03.291
Can't you just
sit down and relax?

38:03.375 --> 38:04.750
Champagne?

38:04.834 --> 38:06.083
No.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.333
Yeah!

38:50.417 --> 38:52.291
Hey, Dan.

38:52.375 --> 38:54.333
Danny, go and say hello.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.792
Go, go and say hello.

38:57.875 --> 38:59.625
Go...

38:59.709 --> 39:01.333
Can I talk to your friend?

39:01.417 --> 39:03.583
Thank you. Hello.

39:03.667 --> 39:04.893
All right, fun's over.
All right...

39:04.917 --> 39:06.917
Oh, that's her boyfriend!

39:20.083 --> 39:22.834
Danny! Danny! Danny!

39:22.917 --> 39:26.333
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!

39:26.417 --> 39:28.250
Get off me. Get off.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.291
Oh, Danny. Danny, come on.
Oh, where are you going?

39:33.375 --> 39:35.083
You're an evil, little shit,
you know that?

39:35.166 --> 39:36.959
I don't know you don't
like whisky, Danny.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.208
Why don't you let me know?

39:38.291 --> 39:39.726
You knew exactly
what you were doing.

39:39.750 --> 39:42.166
I just tried
to help you relax.

39:42.250 --> 39:43.792
I came here tonight

39:43.875 --> 39:45.875
to do an interview,
not to be part

39:45.959 --> 39:47.125
of some crazy
fucking game!

39:47.208 --> 39:48.458
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

39:48.542 --> 39:50.101
I apologize for that,
bringing you here,

39:50.125 --> 39:51.601
knowing your situation
and everything.

39:51.625 --> 39:53.667
You don't know anything
about my fucking situation!

39:53.750 --> 39:55.125
You're right. You're right.

39:55.208 --> 39:56.792
Let's finish
the interview.

39:56.875 --> 39:58.792
Forget it. It's too late
for that now anyway.

39:58.875 --> 40:01.041
- What?
- I need sleep!

40:01.125 --> 40:03.125
And I've still got that
other interview to do.

40:05.083 --> 40:07.291
I thought you do it already.

40:10.333 --> 40:11.458
Didn't you?

40:14.834 --> 40:15.959
No.

40:16.041 --> 40:17.351
I fucked it up
because I was late,

40:17.375 --> 40:18.625
and you want to know why?

40:18.709 --> 40:20.375
It was because of you.
You made me late.

40:20.458 --> 40:24.291
And if I don't get it sorted,
I lose my job, okay?

40:24.375 --> 40:27.291
Why did you come out
with me tonight then?

40:27.375 --> 40:28.792
I don't know.

40:28.875 --> 40:31.075
Maybe I thought that you'd
be slightly more entertaining

40:31.125 --> 40:33.125
than watching reruns
of Growing Pains.

40:33.208 --> 40:36.333
I don't think
that's the real reason.

40:36.417 --> 40:38.737
Or maybe I thought this story
could turn out to be special.

40:38.792 --> 40:40.625
But hey, I was wrong
about that, too.

40:40.709 --> 40:41.834
Good night.

40:44.166 --> 40:46.291
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

40:46.375 --> 40:47.875
Wait, I...

40:47.959 --> 40:50.041
I understand.

40:50.125 --> 40:52.792
The crazy dwarf,
he make you late.

40:52.875 --> 40:54.333
And there you are.

40:54.417 --> 40:56.959
Oh, in the middle of the night,
you know,

40:57.041 --> 40:59.750
far from home in some
shitty hotel room.

41:02.125 --> 41:03.750
There is no one there
to help you.

41:03.834 --> 41:06.625
You're about
to lose your job.

41:06.709 --> 41:09.375
Just you alone,
with the minibar.

41:14.709 --> 41:16.542
I mean, that's it,
isn't it?

41:17.875 --> 41:19.208
You know?

41:19.291 --> 41:21.709
That's the real reason.

41:21.792 --> 41:23.333
Buddy, let's go!

41:23.417 --> 41:25.125
Yeah. I'm going.

41:25.208 --> 41:28.041
No, no. Come on.
You can't leave yet.

41:28.125 --> 41:30.417
Think about it.

41:32.208 --> 41:35.542
What's back at that shitty hotel
except for more of the same?

41:40.250 --> 41:45.041
Why hate yourself when
you can hate me instead?

41:53.959 --> 41:55.417
Ah!

41:55.500 --> 41:59.792
I remember that day on set with
Roger like it was yesterday.

41:59.875 --> 42:03.291
You can stop it with the fucking
bullshit anecdotes

42:03.375 --> 42:05.291
you've been dining out on
since the '70s.

42:05.375 --> 42:06.667
- Whoa.
- Just...

42:06.750 --> 42:07.834
Easy, Danny.

42:07.917 --> 42:10.041
Just tell me what it felt like.

42:10.125 --> 42:11.500
What?

42:11.583 --> 42:13.500
To be famous.
To have made it.

42:13.583 --> 42:16.667
To finally be able
to shove it down the throats

42:16.750 --> 42:20.250
of those fuckers who looked down
on you for being different.

42:20.333 --> 42:23.041
Just tell me what it felt like.

42:23.125 --> 42:26.125
Being famous
is like being drunk,

42:26.208 --> 42:30.083
except the whole world
is drunk with you.

42:32.166 --> 42:34.208
But I didn't make it
after the Bond movie,

42:34.291 --> 42:35.792
if that's what
you're thinking.

42:37.291 --> 42:39.208
You were world-famous.

42:39.291 --> 42:41.000
Everybody knew Nick Nack.

42:41.083 --> 42:43.166
That's not the same thing
as making it.

42:43.250 --> 42:46.500
You don't make it
without money.

42:46.583 --> 42:48.208
Money, money, money, money.

42:50.625 --> 42:54.875
You know, for four year
after the Bond movie,

42:54.959 --> 42:57.333
I couldn't even find a job.

42:59.834 --> 43:03.208
So, is it fair to say

43:03.291 --> 43:06.291
that you consider yourself
a spokesperson

43:06.375 --> 43:07.875
for little people everywhere?

43:07.959 --> 43:09.125
No, not at all, Merv.

43:09.208 --> 43:10.583
I'm just an actor

43:10.667 --> 43:12.542
who's been incredibly
fortunate.

43:12.625 --> 43:16.083
But as the chairman of
the Little People of America,

43:16.166 --> 43:19.250
I feel it's important to play
the correct role in society.

43:19.333 --> 43:23.583
To remind people
life is different for us.

43:23.667 --> 43:26.083
Give us an example
of how it's different.

43:26.166 --> 43:27.810
It's funny you ask that, Merv.

43:27.834 --> 43:29.709
When I worked
with Elvis on Roustabout,

43:29.792 --> 43:30.992
he asked me the same question.

43:31.041 --> 43:32.917
So, what kept you going?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.959
Was it self-belief?

43:35.041 --> 43:36.291
Determination?

43:36.375 --> 43:38.583
Or was it...
was it just pure desperation?

43:38.667 --> 43:41.750
I mean, you had nothing
to lose, nothing to go back to.

43:41.834 --> 43:43.417
No.

43:43.500 --> 43:45.083
It was God.

43:45.166 --> 43:47.250
God is the one
that keep me going.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.083
You seriously believe in God?

43:49.166 --> 43:50.500
Yes.

43:50.583 --> 43:52.750
And I know he would never
let me down.

43:52.834 --> 43:54.834
Well, some might say
he already did.

43:54.917 --> 43:57.125
Yes, he make me
this way, sure.

43:57.208 --> 44:02.250
But I know he offer fame as
one of his little compensations.

44:02.333 --> 44:03.792
I know it.

44:03.875 --> 44:06.291
How could you possibly
know that?

44:06.375 --> 44:09.041
Because I pray
for a miracle.

44:10.709 --> 44:12.375
And it happen.

44:36.500 --> 44:37.750
Hi. I'm Kathy.

44:37.834 --> 44:39.291
I'll be your dresser.

44:41.166 --> 44:42.500
You're going to be great.

44:42.583 --> 44:43.709
Oh, am I?

44:43.792 --> 44:46.417
I don't have audition
in nearly two year.

44:46.500 --> 44:47.875
Oh, you already
have this part.

44:47.959 --> 44:50.125
- How do you know?
- Because I know.

44:50.208 --> 44:54.000
There's only one of you on
this planet that we call Earth.

44:54.083 --> 44:57.125
And if the biggest producer
on this planet, Aaron Spelling,

44:57.208 --> 44:59.166
says that you can do it,
then you can.

44:59.250 --> 45:00.875
Trust me.

45:02.542 --> 45:03.709
Breathe with me.

45:14.500 --> 45:15.625
That was good.

45:15.709 --> 45:17.333
You ready for your fitting now?

45:34.125 --> 45:36.625
Imagine a beautiful island,

45:36.709 --> 45:39.500
somewhere between
heaven and Earth,

45:39.583 --> 45:43.959
where every dream you ever had
can come true.

45:46.792 --> 45:48.000
What do you want to be?

45:48.083 --> 45:50.041
A king? A queen?

45:50.125 --> 45:53.750
A warrior?
A poet? A champion?

45:53.834 --> 45:57.208
Maybe you want to be loved
by everybody.

45:57.291 --> 45:59.208
Or just somebody.

46:00.917 --> 46:03.500
Just tell me the life
you really want to live,

46:03.583 --> 46:07.291
and Mr. Roarke and I
will make it real.

46:13.750 --> 46:15.792
The plane! The plane!

46:24.625 --> 46:26.041
Tattoo.

46:26.125 --> 46:28.208
- Ah, Tattoo.
- Hi, boss.

46:28.291 --> 46:30.091
Do you think I'll be able
to sell my paintings

46:30.166 --> 46:31.333
to the new arrivals?

46:31.417 --> 46:33.041
Not now, Tattoo.

46:33.125 --> 46:36.500
Put your jacket on, please.
It's time to greet our guests.

46:40.583 --> 46:42.583
Oh, now this
I can get used to.

46:42.667 --> 46:44.375
Come along, Tattoo.

46:48.208 --> 46:49.625
It was one of the greatest

46:49.709 --> 46:52.125
on-screen partnership
of all time.

46:52.208 --> 46:55.291
Positions, please, positions.

46:55.375 --> 46:57.458
And smiles, everyone.

46:57.542 --> 46:58.792
Smiles.

46:58.875 --> 47:00.959
Like Aaron Spelling use to say,

47:01.041 --> 47:03.500
Hervé is the tiny
mischievous Starsky.

47:03.583 --> 47:05.333
It's going to be a good week,
Tattoo.

47:05.417 --> 47:09.709
Ricardo is the older,
wiser Hutch.

47:16.208 --> 47:18.583
Wonderful.

47:18.667 --> 47:20.500
Tattoo, Tattoo, Tattoo.

47:20.583 --> 47:25.000
My name is Mr. Roarke,
and I will be your host.

47:25.083 --> 47:27.417
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

47:27.500 --> 47:28.792
- Hear, hear!
- Whoo!

47:28.875 --> 47:31.709
The show is a big, fat hit.

47:33.375 --> 47:35.792
My legend is born.

47:41.333 --> 47:42.750
Down that way.

47:56.083 --> 47:58.000
Hey! What's up, brother?

47:58.083 --> 47:59.250
Come here, bro.

48:19.792 --> 48:22.208
The show is un succès énorme.

48:22.291 --> 48:26.333
I make more money
than I could ever dream.

48:26.417 --> 48:29.125
Thirty-five thousand bucks
a week!

48:30.792 --> 48:33.709
Finally, I make it.

48:33.792 --> 48:35.792
For real.

48:43.291 --> 48:45.542
The world is mine.

48:48.166 --> 48:49.686
Sure,
you could call it a miracle,

48:49.750 --> 48:52.291
but you could also just call
it crazy dumb luck.

48:52.375 --> 48:55.333
It's the same thing,
don't you see?

48:55.417 --> 48:57.500
Fantasy Island
is my just reward.

48:57.583 --> 48:59.917
He have to make it up to me
one way or another.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.208
But were you really proud of it?

49:02.291 --> 49:03.667
I mean, truly?

49:03.750 --> 49:05.291
I mean, you were
a serious painter.

49:05.375 --> 49:06.709
An artist.

49:06.792 --> 49:08.267
A Dali-esque surrealist
in the making.

49:08.291 --> 49:10.250
And here you are starring
in this camp trash.

49:10.333 --> 49:12.583
Why are you always
such a little bitch?

49:12.667 --> 49:14.875
You've got that
market cornered, my friend.

49:14.959 --> 49:16.250
Oh!

49:16.333 --> 49:19.000
You going to pay for that,
Junior.

49:22.917 --> 49:24.250
Scoot, scoot, scoot.

49:24.333 --> 49:25.583
Come on, come on.

49:31.750 --> 49:32.667
Hervé!

49:32.750 --> 49:34.208
Whoo-hoo!

49:38.625 --> 49:40.166
What the fuck?

49:40.250 --> 49:41.542
Hello, Danny!

49:42.875 --> 49:44.750
Stop the stupid car,
you little punk!

49:47.083 --> 49:49.083
Hervé!

49:53.834 --> 49:54.709
Jesus!

49:54.792 --> 49:56.709
Midget prick.

49:57.834 --> 49:59.417
Fucking...

50:02.000 --> 50:03.166
What the fuck?

50:08.333 --> 50:10.166
It's not funny.
This is fucked.

50:10.250 --> 50:11.625
Oh, I'm sorry.

50:11.709 --> 50:12.917
I buy you a new one.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.333
With what?

50:14.417 --> 50:16.291
One of your declined
credit cards?

50:18.750 --> 50:20.041
Hey.

50:20.125 --> 50:21.792
Why don't we talk
about this then, huh?

50:21.875 --> 50:25.166
The actress you met on set.
What's her name, Camille?

50:25.250 --> 50:26.750
That's her name, right?

50:30.500 --> 50:32.834
I don't say her name.

50:32.917 --> 50:34.917
Ever.

50:45.375 --> 50:47.792
Tattoo, Tattoo, Tattoo...

51:00.542 --> 51:02.875
My name is Mr. Roarke.

51:02.959 --> 51:05.208
I will be your host.

51:05.291 --> 51:07.208
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

51:07.291 --> 51:09.625
And cut. Print that one.

51:11.625 --> 51:13.041
You guys were great.

51:13.125 --> 51:17.166
I want you to find out
everything you can about her.

51:17.250 --> 51:18.875
Who?

51:18.959 --> 51:20.417
Her?

51:20.500 --> 51:22.340
Young, beautiful lady.
Such a pleasure.

51:22.375 --> 51:24.542
Kathy,
I want you to talk to her, please.

51:24.625 --> 51:25.750
Why?

51:25.834 --> 51:27.083
Well, she like me.

51:27.166 --> 51:28.750
She's just playing,
that's all.

51:28.834 --> 51:31.208
Well, it's not a good sign
when women are like that.

51:31.291 --> 51:32.458
Thank you so much.

51:32.542 --> 51:33.893
Tell her I want to meet her.

51:33.917 --> 51:35.625
Tell her I have the heart
of a poet.

51:36.959 --> 51:38.083
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

51:38.166 --> 51:39.333
Come on.

51:39.417 --> 51:40.959
Please, Kathy. Come on.

51:46.792 --> 51:47.959
So sweet.

51:48.041 --> 51:49.250
I loved the hug
and the kiss.

51:49.333 --> 51:51.125
It just, it felt right,
you know?

51:51.208 --> 51:53.709
Hello. Hello.

51:53.792 --> 51:56.166
The greatest entrance
in cinema history.

51:56.250 --> 51:58.583
I knew you'd come and say hi.

51:58.667 --> 52:00.375
I'm Camille.

52:02.208 --> 52:03.375
Oh, why, thank you.

52:06.458 --> 52:10.625
And now I pronounce you
husband and wife.

52:12.083 --> 52:13.375
You may kiss the bride.

52:39.625 --> 52:41.291
All I want to do
is take care of you.

52:41.375 --> 52:42.834
And our family.

52:42.917 --> 52:44.166
Yes.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.792
Our family.

53:01.166 --> 53:04.458
I mean, this looks like
quite the Hollywood wedding.

53:04.542 --> 53:07.333
And look at you.
You look so cute.

53:07.417 --> 53:10.166
Hervé, you look so happy.
My God.

53:10.250 --> 53:12.417
That's so sweet.

53:14.583 --> 53:16.667
So, Hervé,

53:16.750 --> 53:19.709
did your outrageous,
out-of-control womanizing

53:19.792 --> 53:23.375
have anything at all to do
with why your wife divorced you?

53:23.458 --> 53:25.417
I am not a womanizer.

53:25.500 --> 53:26.792
I just love women.

53:26.875 --> 53:28.458
- All women.
- Oh, my God.

53:28.542 --> 53:30.917
And no, because by the time
I get married,

53:31.000 --> 53:32.583
I have it all under control.

53:33.959 --> 53:35.417
You must think
I was born yesterday.

53:35.500 --> 53:37.792
Arrêtez! Stop the car!

53:40.792 --> 53:43.667
Where are you going?
Hervé, where...? Come on.

53:45.875 --> 53:48.709
- Hey...
- I don't talk to you no more.

53:48.792 --> 53:50.291
Are you seriously
asking me to believe

53:50.375 --> 53:52.601
that all your womanizing stopped
once you married Camille?

53:52.625 --> 53:54.250
- Yes.
- What kind of bullshit story

53:54.333 --> 53:55.834
are you trying
to sell me, Hervé?

53:55.917 --> 53:57.768
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Of course you are.

53:57.792 --> 54:00.458
You want to believe those
shit rags over me, be my guest.

54:00.542 --> 54:02.041
But I'm telling you
for the last time,

54:02.125 --> 54:03.792
what they say about
me and her isn't true.

54:03.875 --> 54:05.041
Ask me a question.

54:05.125 --> 54:06.565
What, so you can lie
about that, too?

54:06.625 --> 54:07.959
Ask me!

54:08.041 --> 54:09.750
Fine, why did everyone say

54:09.834 --> 54:11.875
you became a nightmare
the moment you got famous?

54:11.959 --> 54:15.041
Everyone?
Who is everyone?

54:15.125 --> 54:17.208
Why don't we start
with Ricardo Montalbán?

54:17.291 --> 54:20.875
Fantasy Island is a vehicle
for Ricardo Montalbán.

54:20.959 --> 54:22.250
He is the star.

54:22.333 --> 54:24.041
But Tattoo
steal his thunder.

54:24.125 --> 54:25.208
Huh? He jealous.

54:25.291 --> 54:27.208
Now that is the real story,
Junior.

54:27.291 --> 54:29.709
Why on earth would
he be jealous of you?

54:29.792 --> 54:33.875
Because this wretched
little freak

54:33.959 --> 54:36.417
is almost as famous
as he is.

54:36.500 --> 54:38.458
He eat at the best restaurants,

54:38.542 --> 54:40.375
he makes almost the same
amount of money,

54:40.458 --> 54:43.500
he fuck more beautiful women,
and this snob Montalbán,

54:43.583 --> 54:44.792
he can't stand it.

54:44.875 --> 54:46.250
Drive him crazy.

54:46.333 --> 54:48.133
A guy like Montalbán
doesn't exactly strike me

54:48.208 --> 54:49.583
as the jealous type.

54:49.667 --> 54:52.083
You weren't there.
You wouldn't know.

54:52.166 --> 54:55.041
He try to push my buttons
so I explode.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.709
So I disappoint him.

55:03.208 --> 55:05.583
He's still in his trailer.

55:05.667 --> 55:07.208
Ah, Ricardo.

55:07.291 --> 55:09.208
I was going to give you
a ride to set,

55:09.291 --> 55:12.000
but I realize I don't
have any room.

55:15.208 --> 55:16.959
This is my fan mail.

55:17.041 --> 55:18.875
And this is my new fan.

55:18.959 --> 55:22.917
And I am so sorry,
this is your fan mail.

55:24.291 --> 55:26.417
Good manners and charm,
eh, Hervé?

55:26.500 --> 55:32.291
And I wanted to thank you for
taking out all my scenes today.

55:32.375 --> 55:35.375
The writers make all
the final decisions, Hervé.

55:35.458 --> 55:37.375
I merely suggest.
You know that.

55:37.458 --> 55:39.750
You love to suggest,
don't you?

55:39.834 --> 55:41.834
You're an incredibly
talented actor

55:41.917 --> 55:43.834
with a marvelous
sense of humor.

55:43.917 --> 55:47.458
Frankly, it's no wonder
that you are so popular.

55:47.542 --> 55:51.959
But I must tell you that most
of the letters in your bag...

55:53.166 --> 55:55.250
they're from me.

55:56.542 --> 55:58.083
I will see you on set.

55:58.166 --> 55:59.917
Let's not keep them waiting.

56:06.083 --> 56:08.041
I never had so much fun
in my life.

56:08.125 --> 56:09.542
In my whole goddamn life.

56:09.625 --> 56:11.667
It didn't sound like fun
for anyone else.

56:11.750 --> 56:13.750
All I know is that
millions of people

56:13.834 --> 56:15.792
tune in to watch that show.

56:15.875 --> 56:18.166
It's not my fault
they turn me into a god.

56:18.250 --> 56:20.291
A god?

56:20.375 --> 56:22.041
Really? Wow!

56:22.125 --> 56:24.625
It's incredible
when you think about it.

56:24.709 --> 56:26.458
What's incredible?

56:26.542 --> 56:28.667
Fantasy Island
gave you everything.

56:28.750 --> 56:31.291
Money. Fame. Women.

56:31.375 --> 56:33.208
- Everything.
- So?

56:33.291 --> 56:36.458
So, even I couldn't have
fucked that up so spectacularly.

56:36.542 --> 56:39.208
You think I fuck
everything up?

56:39.291 --> 56:40.500
Of course you did.

56:40.583 --> 56:42.041
You're struggling for years,

56:42.125 --> 56:44.085
then you're handed this miracle
of an opportunity.

56:44.125 --> 56:45.917
Continue. Please.

56:47.250 --> 56:49.625
And you just pissed
it all away.

57:04.083 --> 57:06.166
Look at some of these.
I mean some of these just make

57:06.250 --> 57:08.542
great, great reading.

57:08.625 --> 57:10.250
"Drunk Dwarf Sex Scandal."

57:10.333 --> 57:12.166
"Strip Poker in a Hot Tub."

57:12.250 --> 57:15.500
I mean, this is genius.
I wish I could've been there.

57:15.583 --> 57:17.875
That sounds like a fun night.
Very nice.

57:17.959 --> 57:19.879
Now let's have a look
at some of this stuff here.

57:21.375 --> 57:25.458
"Celebrity midget declares
on-set sex clinic open.

57:25.542 --> 57:26.834
Appointments are free."

57:26.917 --> 57:28.500
Generous bastard.

57:28.583 --> 57:30.667
That is just so nice.

57:30.750 --> 57:32.630
I mean, most of this stuff
would be true, right?

57:32.667 --> 57:36.125
You expect me to take
that trash seriously?

57:36.208 --> 57:38.458
It is public record.

57:40.834 --> 57:42.208
What are you doing?
Hervé...

57:43.750 --> 57:45.792
don't do that.

57:45.875 --> 57:48.333
Hervé, don't...

57:48.417 --> 57:50.000
Brilliant.

57:53.750 --> 57:55.709
Now it's public record.

57:56.834 --> 57:58.625
So it's all true then.

57:58.709 --> 58:00.291
You know, you of all people
should know

58:00.375 --> 58:02.083
what bullshit
those stories are.

58:02.166 --> 58:04.667
Lies created to sell paper.

58:04.750 --> 58:08.291
Isn't that why you were
sent here, Junior?

58:08.375 --> 58:11.166
To write a funny little story
about a dwarf?

58:11.250 --> 58:12.792
Yes, that's right.
I was.

58:12.875 --> 58:16.834
But then you insisted
on telling me the "real" story.

58:16.917 --> 58:20.166
I mean, that's why
I'm here, right?

58:20.250 --> 58:22.333
The real story?

58:22.417 --> 58:24.000
Okay, Junior.

58:24.083 --> 58:25.959
Coming right up.

58:32.542 --> 58:33.750
Oh, wait up.

58:33.834 --> 58:35.458
Hervé, what are you doing?

58:35.542 --> 58:36.750
Hervé?

58:38.417 --> 58:41.000
Hello? Hello?

58:41.083 --> 58:43.000
- Hello?
- Hervé, get back in the car.

58:43.083 --> 58:45.166
Shut up. It's fine.
Don't worry.

58:45.250 --> 58:47.250
Hervé, get back
in the fucking car.

58:50.709 --> 58:52.625
Hervé! Come back!

58:55.166 --> 58:56.500
Oh, fuck's sake.

58:56.583 --> 58:57.959
Hervé, get out!

59:00.667 --> 59:02.208
Danny. Danny, come on.

59:02.291 --> 59:05.083
What are you doing? Get out.
There's someone in there.

59:05.166 --> 59:08.333
Stay right where you are.
I'm on the phone to 911.

59:08.417 --> 59:10.750
Marty, it's me, Hervé.

59:10.834 --> 59:12.667
What the f...?

59:15.792 --> 59:17.917
Hervé, what the fuck
do you think you're doing?

59:18.000 --> 59:19.917
I'm sorry, Marty,
but no one answer the door.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.375
We need to talk.
It's important.

59:21.458 --> 59:22.792
It's the middle of the night!

59:22.875 --> 59:24.750
Come here. Come.

59:24.834 --> 59:26.041
This is my friend.

59:26.125 --> 59:28.542
He's a journalist
from an English newspaper.

59:28.625 --> 59:30.959
He interview me
for a very important story,

59:31.041 --> 59:32.542
and I need to talk to you,
Marty.

59:32.625 --> 59:35.417
Jesus fucking Christ, Hervé.
I could've shot you.

59:35.500 --> 59:37.583
Oh, relax, Marty.

59:39.792 --> 59:41.291
- Come on.
- Fuck no.

59:43.500 --> 59:44.625
No.

59:44.709 --> 59:46.375
So, you're a reporter?

59:46.458 --> 59:48.000
For my sins.

59:48.083 --> 59:50.625
And you're... you're doing
a story about this guy?

59:50.709 --> 59:51.959
Yeah.

59:52.041 --> 59:53.250
You sure you're okay
with this?

59:53.333 --> 59:54.959
I got nothing to hide.

59:55.041 --> 59:57.417
Tell him the truth about
what happened with Montalbán.

59:57.500 --> 59:59.041
How he destroy
my reputation.

59:59.125 --> 01:00:00.583
Yeah, sure.

01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:02.542
Montalbán went after you.
That's true.

01:00:02.625 --> 01:00:04.125
See? See, I tell you.

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:09.125
But do you remember why?

01:00:09.208 --> 01:00:10.667
Because I do.

01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:14.750
Oh, boy, do I ever.

01:00:17.333 --> 01:00:18.792
Where is he?

01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:20.625
He says he doesn't have

01:00:20.709 --> 01:00:22.750
enough lines to say
this week,

01:00:22.834 --> 01:00:24.333
and he suggests...

01:00:24.417 --> 01:00:26.750
What... what does he suggest?

01:00:26.834 --> 01:00:30.709
That you let his stand-in
do the episode instead?

01:00:30.792 --> 01:00:33.875
Let his stand-in
do the episode?

01:00:33.959 --> 01:00:38.583
He wants his stand-in
to do the episode.

01:00:40.208 --> 01:00:44.583
Well, if it's this beautiful
8-year-old girl...

01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:47.917
she is the better actor.

01:00:49.375 --> 01:00:51.583
A true artist
would be here today

01:00:51.667 --> 01:00:53.959
to support his fellow artists

01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:56.834
and show respect
for our writers!

01:00:56.917 --> 01:01:00.417
Fantasy Island
is very important to me!

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.208
Yeah, Mr. Montalbán, please...

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:04.000
Out with that French
homunculus!

01:01:04.083 --> 01:01:05.917
You get me Spelling
on the phone right now!

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.125
Please.

01:01:07.208 --> 01:01:09.458
Mm, yeah.

01:01:09.542 --> 01:01:12.166
He will not take our show down!

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:14.709
We have worked too hard
for this success!

01:01:14.792 --> 01:01:18.583
My apologies.
This is not my nature.

01:01:20.542 --> 01:01:22.834
Let's take...
let's take 10.

01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:26.166
Everyone know I am the
reason this show is a sensation!

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:27.500
Hervé...

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:29.542
I'm sick of that dumbass
Frito Bandito.

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:31.083
Keep your voice down.

01:01:31.166 --> 01:01:34.291
You tell Aaron I want
the same money as Ricardo.

01:01:34.375 --> 01:01:35.750
The same.

01:01:35.834 --> 01:01:37.041
You're being unreasonable.

01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:38.291
Oh, oh.

01:01:38.375 --> 01:01:39.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:40.917
I am being unreasonable?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.208
Oh, excusez-moi.

01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:45.333
I, you know, because all I want
is respect.

01:01:45.417 --> 01:01:46.834
And that means money!

01:01:46.917 --> 01:01:49.625
Look how much money
they're making!

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:55.125
Hervé, you have money
and respect.

01:01:55.208 --> 01:01:57.041
Then why do they treat me
like a child?

01:01:57.125 --> 01:01:59.667
They are abusers!

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:01.709
I know how challenging
all of this can be,

01:02:01.792 --> 01:02:03.291
especially since
you just got married.

01:02:03.375 --> 01:02:06.208
This has nothing to do
with my marriage!

01:02:06.291 --> 01:02:08.375
This is business, Marty!

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:11.792
You tell Aaron, Tattoo wants
the same as Roarke.

01:02:11.875 --> 01:02:14.375
Trust me when I tell you
that is a very bad idea.

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:18.750
If you don't tell them, I will.

01:02:18.834 --> 01:02:20.959
Hervé, you don't get it,
do you?

01:02:22.792 --> 01:02:23.875
Listen to me.

01:02:23.959 --> 01:02:26.041
You will never get
another show like this.

01:02:26.125 --> 01:02:27.375
Ever.

01:02:27.458 --> 01:02:30.000
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, believe me.

01:02:30.083 --> 01:02:32.709
Being on this show
is like winning the lottery.

01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:34.166
Do you understand?

01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:38.625
Without me,
there is no show.

01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:45.355
They nearly ran me
out of the business

01:02:45.417 --> 01:02:46.667
because he was my client.

01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:48.041
Just because of that?

01:02:48.125 --> 01:02:50.125
No, because he was
so fucking crazy.

01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:53.917
In 1981, he spent
150 grand on parties.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.709
Just crazy parties.

01:02:55.792 --> 01:02:57.417
We had to tell the IRS
that he'd built

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.291
the most expensive swimming pool
in the history of Hollywood.

01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:01.542
You remember that, Hervé?

01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:02.917
I was having a good time.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.250
Isn't that what
a big star does?

01:03:04.333 --> 01:03:06.125
Yeah, great. Have a great time.

01:03:06.208 --> 01:03:08.250
But don't spend
every single penny.

01:03:08.333 --> 01:03:11.500
I told you. I told you
to put the money away.

01:03:11.583 --> 01:03:13.625
I did. I told him.
But he refused.

01:03:13.709 --> 01:03:15.667
So I put some money aside
for him anyway.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.417
But then he finds out
about that,

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.226
he freaks out,
and he spends all of that too.

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:20.458
Because you go
behind my back.

01:03:20.542 --> 01:03:21.709
I was trying to help you.

01:03:21.792 --> 01:03:23.125
I was. I was trying
to help him.

01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:25.166
See, see? This is what
they're like in Hollywood

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:26.417
when they try to help you.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:27.625
Tell him the truth, Marty.

01:03:27.709 --> 01:03:29.149
Tell him about
all those kids I help.

01:03:29.208 --> 01:03:31.008
Yeah, you did. You did.
More than I can count.

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:33.458
- See? See?
- But you didn't help yourself!

01:03:33.542 --> 01:03:35.709
Hervé...

01:03:35.792 --> 01:03:37.125
I love you.

01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:41.291
But you just don't remember
how bad it got.

01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:09.917
- Hervé.
- Ooh!

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.125
Hey, I know who you are,

01:04:11.208 --> 01:04:13.083
and I appreciate
all your success.

01:04:13.166 --> 01:04:14.667
Don't take this
the wrong way,

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.667
but why don't you try and act
with a little more class?

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.792
Go fuck yourself.

01:04:19.875 --> 01:04:21.917
Come here!

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:25.667
You son of a bitch!
Come here!

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:33.000
Okay, all right, that's enough.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:39.792
Hervé.

01:04:41.792 --> 01:04:43.917
Ah, hello, Mr. Spelling.

01:04:52.875 --> 01:04:54.500
Jesus Christ.

01:04:54.583 --> 01:04:55.667
Mm.

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:57.000
Hervé, you and I
need to talk.

01:04:57.083 --> 01:04:58.643
No, Aaron.
Two minutes and I'll be ready.

01:04:58.667 --> 01:05:00.875
- You are three hours late.
- Okay. You know.

01:05:00.959 --> 01:05:02.458
This is not how
you behave on my set.

01:05:02.542 --> 01:05:04.208
Just relax, Aaron.
You know? Relax.

01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:05.476
- Relax?
- Take a vacation, huh?

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.100
You have held us hostage
for three hours.

01:05:07.125 --> 01:05:10.125
Hostage? Come on. Come on.

01:05:11.583 --> 01:05:13.000
No!

01:05:13.083 --> 01:05:15.000
Cannot take the fucking house,
Marty!

01:05:15.083 --> 01:05:17.583
The house is mine, Marty!

01:05:17.667 --> 01:05:19.083
No, you tell them!

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:21.500
No, no, you don't say no to me!
I say no to you!

01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:23.083
You call Camille's lawyer
and tell...

01:05:23.166 --> 01:05:26.375
No, you do that,
I fire the whole company!

01:05:27.959 --> 01:05:29.768
- Hervé, the network...
- Out of my way, Aaron!

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.309
...is very concerned
about your behavior.

01:05:31.333 --> 01:05:33.625
- I can't protect...
- Later, Aaron!

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.250
Drive the fucking car!

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:39.000
My apologies, Ricardo.

01:05:39.083 --> 01:05:41.250
Why are we sitting here?
Drive the fucking car!

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:43.208
Drive right over here.

01:05:43.291 --> 01:05:45.250
I don't want to talk
to that fucking banana.

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:47.750
Let's go!

01:05:47.834 --> 01:05:49.125
Now!

01:05:54.834 --> 01:05:57.917
I understand this is a most difficult moment

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.041
in your personal life.

01:06:00.125 --> 01:06:02.041
But we have a crew waiting.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.542
And this is not the first time
you make them wait.

01:06:04.625 --> 01:06:06.792
Contrary to what you may think,

01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:09.417
I am your friend,
and I understand your pain.

01:06:11.375 --> 01:06:13.166
Although I hate the sin,

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:15.000
I've been taught
to love the sinner.

01:06:15.083 --> 01:06:17.959
So please listen to me
very carefully.

01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:19.500
If you decide to leave now,

01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:21.375
your life will never
be the same.

01:06:21.458 --> 01:06:24.875
And I promise you,
you will regret it.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.375
So come, Tattoo.

01:06:30.083 --> 01:06:31.917
Let's welcome our guests.

01:06:38.208 --> 01:06:40.500
Thank you for trying,
Ricardo.

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:46.709
Perhaps there's another
little man.

01:06:51.083 --> 01:06:53.583
That was the beginning
of the end.

01:06:55.083 --> 01:06:57.542
He warned you.

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:12.917
Thank you for seeing me tonight,
Marty.

01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:15.667
Don't mention it.

01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:19.333
I know it was hard for you
all those years,

01:07:19.417 --> 01:07:22.709
and I want you to know
I appreciate all your hard work.

01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:25.375
Okay.

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:36.750
Next time,
use the front door.

01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:08.291
I'm sorry you had
to go through that...

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:09.500
Don't, don't.

01:08:12.583 --> 01:08:14.041
It must feel good
to think

01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:16.250
that you are better
than everyone else, hmm?

01:08:16.332 --> 01:08:18.207
- I don't.
- At least I've had success.

01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:20.417
- You never will.
- Oh, I see.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.893
You're just going to pick on me
now because you're embarrassed.

01:08:22.917 --> 01:08:25.332
You know why people
like you never succeed?

01:08:25.417 --> 01:08:29.500
It is because you don't have
the balls to do it yourself.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.448
So much easier to sit on
the sidelines judging, isn't it?

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.917
I was right
about what happened.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.207
About your role in it.

01:08:36.291 --> 01:08:37.875
You were to blame
more than anyone else.

01:08:37.959 --> 01:08:39.041
That is the truth.

01:08:39.125 --> 01:08:40.375
Don't you lecture me
about that.

01:08:40.457 --> 01:08:41.917
You know what I think?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.500
I think the reason you point
the finger for a living

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:46.125
is because you don't want
anyone to see

01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:48.250
who you really are,
that underneath all those words,

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:49.625
you are nothing!

01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:52.959
But you don't fool me.

01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:54.917
No. I see you.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.542
Danny T...

01:08:56.625 --> 01:08:58.417
ah, Danny Tate.

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.457
This is a waste
of fuckin' time.

01:09:00.542 --> 01:09:01.875
- Pull over.
- Yeah.

01:09:13.542 --> 01:09:17.041
Who the fuck do you think
you are to walk away from me?

01:09:17.125 --> 01:09:19.082
What did you ever do?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.667
You've done nothing!

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:25.166
You've lived nothing!

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:28.917
What gives you the right
to judge, Junior?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.625
Nothing.

01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:32.834
But at least I'm willing
to take responsibility

01:09:32.917 --> 01:09:34.166
for the shit that I've done.

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:35.834
But you? No way.
Not even now.

01:09:35.917 --> 01:09:37.291
Not even years fucking later.

01:09:37.375 --> 01:09:39.750
What a sad, pathetic,
little freak you are.

01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:44.500
What? You still think
I'm the one

01:09:44.582 --> 01:09:45.750
that fuck everything up?

01:09:45.834 --> 01:09:47.250
Look at you!
Look at you!

01:09:47.332 --> 01:09:49.041
Thirty-two days sober.

01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:52.417
And now what is it?
What is it? Two hour? Huh?

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.000
Oh, you feel like
a drink now?

01:09:54.082 --> 01:09:55.333
Huh?

01:09:55.417 --> 01:09:56.834
You made your fucking point.

01:09:56.917 --> 01:09:58.834
At least my life
will be remembered.

01:09:58.917 --> 01:10:01.000
It will count for something.

01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:04.000
But you, you're nothing more
than a footnote.

01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:09.041
You will be forgotten
before I finish this sentence.

01:10:09.125 --> 01:10:11.834
Yeah? So why don't you just
fucking kill me then?

01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:14.250
Huh? Go on!

01:10:14.333 --> 01:10:16.417
It'll make the perfect ending.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.500
You'd be doing us all a favor.

01:10:18.583 --> 01:10:21.208
I'm just one of the little
people after all.

01:10:21.291 --> 01:10:24.208
What bloody difference
would it make?

01:10:24.291 --> 01:10:26.834
But then no one's going to
fucking read about it, are they?

01:10:34.333 --> 01:10:37.125
Do you think you're the only one
who's had a tough life?

01:10:37.208 --> 01:10:40.417
Who's fucked things up
and had trouble admitting it?

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.875
You don't own that,

01:10:41.959 --> 01:10:44.291
you egotistical,
entitled little prick!

01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:45.917
We all have!

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.458
We're all fucking human!
Fuck you!

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.667
The truth is,

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:53.667
you wanted to drag me down
into the shit

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.792
so that you'd feel better
about the mess

01:10:55.875 --> 01:10:58.166
that you've made
with your life.

01:10:59.709 --> 01:11:02.500
But it's not
going to wash, mate.

01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:04.583
This real story of yours?

01:11:04.667 --> 01:11:06.375
It's not real.

01:11:06.458 --> 01:11:07.875
It's not even a fucking story.

01:11:07.959 --> 01:11:10.375
It's a... it's a press release.

01:11:10.458 --> 01:11:13.458
Do you honestly think that
that's going to be printed

01:11:13.542 --> 01:11:14.709
all over the world?

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:16.417
Because let me
tell you something.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.667
It's going to be lucky
if it's a quarter of a page

01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:20.959
in the back
next to the fucking recipes.

01:11:24.291 --> 01:11:26.959
No one gives a fuck, Hervé.

01:11:27.041 --> 01:11:28.333
No one cares.

01:11:29.792 --> 01:11:32.667
This real story of yours,
it's a joke.

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:37.208
Your life...

01:11:39.208 --> 01:11:41.208
is a joke.

01:11:45.208 --> 01:11:47.458
Finally.

01:11:47.542 --> 01:11:49.542
I see the real you.

01:11:50.917 --> 01:11:54.166
And I'm not your fucking
Junior either.

01:11:56.458 --> 01:11:57.667
You're right.

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:58.959
Of course I'm right.

01:11:59.041 --> 01:12:00.667
No, no.

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:04.041
I mean it's not much
of a story, is it?

01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:05.792
Who knows?

01:12:05.875 --> 01:12:07.333
Maybe having a knife
pulled on you

01:12:07.417 --> 01:12:08.917
by a delusional
celebrity dwarf

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.875
is worth half a page
on a slow news day.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.667
Okay.

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:18.709
Okay, we go now.

01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:25.000
I-I... I'll take you home.

01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:27.000
Yeah. Take me home.

01:12:27.083 --> 01:12:29.083
About fuckin' time.

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.417
But before we go...

01:12:39.583 --> 01:12:41.542
we make one last stop.

01:12:43.375 --> 01:12:44.500
A stop?

01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:45.750
No.

01:12:45.834 --> 01:12:47.667
No more stops.

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:52.917
Danny, what is a story
without an ending?

01:12:56.667 --> 01:12:58.583
Hervé, I just...

01:12:58.667 --> 01:13:02.250
I can't handle
any more crazy.

01:13:03.625 --> 01:13:04.750
No more.

01:13:05.959 --> 01:13:07.959
No more. I promise.

01:13:08.041 --> 01:13:10.291
You promise?

01:13:11.917 --> 01:13:13.959
I promise.

01:13:35.834 --> 01:13:39.291
Welcome to Fantasy Island,
Mr. Tate.

01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:41.250
Formidable, non?

01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:44.959
This is where we shoot
the plane landing, right here.

01:13:47.333 --> 01:13:49.875
Do you want me to say it?

01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:52.792
Not particularly.

01:13:52.875 --> 01:13:55.500
The plane! The plane!

01:14:09.667 --> 01:14:11.166
What is it?

01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:16.333
This is where she was standing
when I first saw her.

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:19.458
Camille.

01:14:23.917 --> 01:14:25.208
You were right.

01:14:26.875 --> 01:14:28.417
It was me.

01:14:30.792 --> 01:14:33.375
I fuck everything up.

01:14:33.458 --> 01:14:35.792
Why? Why did you?

01:14:35.875 --> 01:14:37.959
I don't know.

01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:40.083
I just went crazy.

01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:46.542
There must have been a moment...

01:14:48.542 --> 01:14:49.917
a moment when...

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.959
when you decided
to blow everything up,

01:14:52.041 --> 01:14:54.041
when you could've made
another choice,

01:14:54.125 --> 01:14:55.458
stopped yourself, when...

01:14:55.542 --> 01:14:58.500
when things could've
turned out differently.

01:14:58.583 --> 01:15:01.125
I don't know.
I never think about it.

01:15:01.208 --> 01:15:03.542
So think about it.

01:15:06.417 --> 01:15:08.792
What about you?
What was your moment?

01:15:10.083 --> 01:15:11.917
Me?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.083
Christ, I don't know.

01:15:16.375 --> 01:15:19.208
For me, moments never stop.

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:25.166
Camille! Camille!

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:27.059
I have a restraining order here,
Mr. Villechaize,

01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:28.723
ordering you off the property
immediately.

01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:31.000
- I don't give a shit.
- No need for unpleasantness.

01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:33.959
- Where is she, cockbag?
- Hey, lookie here, short stuff.

01:15:34.041 --> 01:15:35.166
Fuck!

01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:36.625
- Hervé?
- Ah, Camille.

01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:38.834
Camille! Camille!

01:15:40.291 --> 01:15:42.333
Camille, baby.

01:15:42.417 --> 01:15:43.625
Shit!

01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:46.166
Camille, baby, I love you!

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:49.125
Camille! Camille!

01:15:49.208 --> 01:15:53.750
It was 15 months to
the day after we got married.

01:15:53.834 --> 01:15:55.333
Where are you? Camille!

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:58.291
I should've known
she planned to do it.

01:15:58.375 --> 01:16:01.500
She planned to take away
my whole life.

01:16:09.458 --> 01:16:12.417
I so wanted her
to love me.

01:16:13.792 --> 01:16:15.500
But did you love her?

01:16:18.792 --> 01:16:20.375
I don't know.

01:16:20.458 --> 01:16:22.792
I don't know.
I thought I did.

01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:28.166
I thought if I could
just make her love me,

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:31.750
that everything
would be all right.

01:16:31.834 --> 01:16:33.834
And I-I...

01:16:36.375 --> 01:16:38.125
...I would be all right.

01:16:40.792 --> 01:16:42.500
But I realize...

01:16:43.875 --> 01:16:46.000
you cannot make
someone love you.

01:16:49.291 --> 01:16:51.166
Not if they don't want to.

01:16:53.083 --> 01:16:55.333
Not if they never did.

01:16:58.083 --> 01:16:59.893
Goldie Hawn, you have $50.

01:16:59.917 --> 01:17:01.709
150 to 50.

01:17:01.792 --> 01:17:04.500
And we'll find out who can keep
playing, after this.

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:10.291
- Hey, boss!
- Hey, little fella.

01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:11.625
What can I get you?

01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:13.208
The chocolate!
The chocolate!

01:17:13.291 --> 01:17:14.500
No, no, no, no, no.

01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:16.792
The cinnamon!
The cinnamon!

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:19.083
No, no, no.
The plain! The plain!

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:27.959
Eventually a man must realize,

01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:31.166
life don't depend
on what he is able to do,

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:34.375
only on what he is able
to accept.

01:17:35.834 --> 01:17:39.166
So let's have a warm GM welcome

01:17:39.250 --> 01:17:40.959
for our special guest.

01:17:41.041 --> 01:17:43.291
It's the midget
with the heart of gold:

01:17:43.375 --> 01:17:44.750
Tattoo!

01:17:44.834 --> 01:17:46.875
Herby Velcheez!

01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:48.792
Whoo!

01:17:48.875 --> 01:17:51.000
Ah, look at that!

01:17:52.917 --> 01:17:54.500
Where's the plane?

01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:56.208
Hervé!

01:17:57.917 --> 01:18:00.083
Say that thing you say!

01:18:02.333 --> 01:18:04.417
Hey, Hervé, over here, buddy!

01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:06.792
Hey!

01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:14.208
Back up!
Get out of here!

01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:19.542
I am so sick of this shit,
Kathy!

01:18:19.625 --> 01:18:20.834
- Like...
- Okay, baby,

01:18:20.917 --> 01:18:22.083
but try to calm down.

01:18:22.166 --> 01:18:24.208
I'm sick! I'm sick of...

01:18:24.291 --> 01:18:25.768
So we won't do it anymore.
We're done.

01:18:25.792 --> 01:18:27.959
We won't do
this shit anymore.

01:18:29.625 --> 01:18:31.375
Baby, what are you...?

01:18:31.458 --> 01:18:32.583
Fuck, what are you doing?

01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:35.458
God!

01:19:10.792 --> 01:19:11.917
Kathy.

01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:21.250
At the end of the day,

01:19:21.333 --> 01:19:25.500
I realize I am no different
to anyone else.

01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:30.542
Addicted to a fantasy.

01:19:34.208 --> 01:19:39.166
The fantasy that something
or someone

01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:43.375
will take away
the pain of life.

01:19:56.417 --> 01:19:59.250
It is going to be
a beautiful morning.

01:20:19.208 --> 01:20:20.625
When you go back?

01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:22.226
Maybe tomorrow.
Or the day after.

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:23.375
I don't know yet.

01:20:23.458 --> 01:20:26.458
Come see me tonight,
at my hotel.

01:20:26.542 --> 01:20:27.750
Tonight?

01:20:27.834 --> 01:20:28.875
Yeah.

01:20:28.959 --> 01:20:32.125
I stay at the Sheraton
in Universal.

01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:34.875
They fumigate my house.

01:20:36.542 --> 01:20:39.166
Allergic to the fumes.

01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:40.542
Please come.

01:20:42.083 --> 01:20:43.583
I don't have
any more questions.

01:20:43.667 --> 01:20:45.917
Well, I don't have
any more answers.

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:50.250
But I have
something for you.

01:20:52.083 --> 01:20:53.625
We'll see.

01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:55.125
It's been a long night.

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:24.230
We all took a bet
how long it would be

01:21:24.291 --> 01:21:25.500
before you were off the wagon.

01:21:27.458 --> 01:21:29.658
I haven't been drinking again,
if that's what you think.

01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:31.000
It's all right, mate.

01:21:31.083 --> 01:21:32.625
You're far less
boring that way.

01:21:35.166 --> 01:21:36.333
What are you doing here?

01:21:36.417 --> 01:21:38.875
Baskin's got a job for me.

01:21:38.959 --> 01:21:40.417
What?

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.792
Something about
a hatchet job.

01:21:45.125 --> 01:21:46.458
You kidding?

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:48.959
What'd you expect?

01:21:50.542 --> 01:21:52.041
So she fired me?

01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:53.667
I don't know.

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:55.333
You'd better ask her.

01:22:00.333 --> 01:22:01.542
Oh, be a pal.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.709
Let her know I arrived safely,
will you?

01:22:20.125 --> 01:22:22.000
Danny! Danny!

01:22:22.083 --> 01:22:24.166
Danny! Danny!

01:22:32.166 --> 01:22:33.625
Danny.

01:22:35.625 --> 01:22:36.834
Yeah.

01:22:40.333 --> 01:22:41.583
My girlfriend.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.458
Hello?

01:24:00.542 --> 01:24:01.709
Katie?

01:24:03.625 --> 01:24:05.792
Danny, I told you not to...

01:24:05.875 --> 01:24:08.917
No, don't hang up, Katie.
Please, please.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.458
You don't have to say anything.

01:24:15.166 --> 01:24:16.750
I worked it out.

01:24:20.208 --> 01:24:22.250
Why I can't accept it.

01:24:26.041 --> 01:24:28.458
And I know there's nothing
I can do to fix it.

01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:34.709
But I wanted you to know that...

01:24:36.291 --> 01:24:37.959
...I know it's over.

01:24:41.792 --> 01:24:44.625
I know. I know it is,
and I'm sorry.

01:24:51.166 --> 01:24:53.375
Because you both deserve better.

01:24:57.375 --> 01:24:58.667
It's...

01:25:00.667 --> 01:25:03.333
it's really good...

01:25:03.417 --> 01:25:05.500
that you're saying
all of this.

01:25:08.792 --> 01:25:10.542
That you're realizing...

01:25:33.375 --> 01:25:34.750
Danny?

01:25:37.333 --> 01:25:38.875
I'm still here.

01:26:07.041 --> 01:26:08.583
Shit.

01:26:22.792 --> 01:26:24.250
LAX, please.

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:41.417
I have to make a quick stop.

01:26:46.125 --> 01:26:47.625
Give me a few minutes.

01:26:52.917 --> 01:26:54.333
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:26:54.417 --> 01:26:56.834
It's Danny Tate
for Hervé Villechaize, 1702.

01:26:56.917 --> 01:26:58.250
Of course.

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:02.542
Yes, there's a Mr. Tate
here to see you?

01:27:02.625 --> 01:27:05.333
Oh, very good. Down the hall,
elevator's to the left.

01:27:05.417 --> 01:27:06.500
Thank you.

01:27:15.834 --> 01:27:17.166
Hello?

01:27:25.458 --> 01:27:26.625
Hello?

01:27:29.041 --> 01:27:30.333
It's you.

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:35.458
Hervé...

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.500
What is that?

01:27:41.875 --> 01:27:43.959
My stun gun.

01:27:44.041 --> 01:27:46.750
Fifteen thousand volts,
you know.

01:27:46.834 --> 01:27:48.041
Just in case.

01:27:50.291 --> 01:27:51.500
In case of what?

01:27:54.458 --> 01:27:55.875
Ah.

01:27:55.959 --> 01:27:57.750
No, no, no.

01:27:57.834 --> 01:27:59.750
I have problem
with my back,

01:27:59.834 --> 01:28:02.041
but, you know,
I find a solution?

01:28:04.792 --> 01:28:06.625
Roger's with me always.

01:28:08.333 --> 01:28:10.208
You see?

01:28:10.291 --> 01:28:12.166
Huh?

01:28:13.875 --> 01:28:15.250
Want a Sprite?

01:28:15.333 --> 01:28:17.333
No, thank you.
I don't have much time.

01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:21.291
Ah, well, it's late
for these already.

01:28:26.625 --> 01:28:28.041
What is all this?

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.959
The children,
they still write,

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.458
even though they all
grown up now.

01:28:35.542 --> 01:28:37.458
You know,
they ask for things.

01:28:37.542 --> 01:28:40.125
They ask for, you know,
autographs.

01:28:40.208 --> 01:28:41.917
Photos.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.625
Advice.

01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:45.709
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

01:28:58.291 --> 01:29:01.000
So in the end
you found her?

01:29:01.083 --> 01:29:02.417
The one?

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.458
Kathy. Yes.

01:29:07.667 --> 01:29:09.583
She is my best friend.

01:29:10.834 --> 01:29:13.291
I'm sure lucky
to find her.

01:29:14.959 --> 01:29:18.166
She help me through
the hardest years of my life

01:29:18.250 --> 01:29:20.917
and all my health problems.

01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:28.750
There is nothing
I would do to hurt her.

01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:35.750
Is this your mother?

01:29:36.959 --> 01:29:39.417
Is she still alive?

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.625
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:29:42.792 --> 01:29:43.875
She...

01:29:43.959 --> 01:29:45.542
I don't see her
since that night,

01:29:45.625 --> 01:29:47.875
the night of the premiere.

01:29:47.959 --> 01:29:50.917
I think I owe you the truth.

01:30:14.667 --> 01:30:18.458
I hadn't seen my parents
in over 10 year.

01:31:21.333 --> 01:31:23.208
You know, I was thinking
of giving these

01:31:23.291 --> 01:31:24.792
to the Television Academy.

01:31:24.875 --> 01:31:28.917
But I think it's better
that you take them.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.375
Why?

01:31:30.458 --> 01:31:32.667
For your story.

01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:34.667
No, I couldn't.

01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:36.875
Please.

01:31:38.041 --> 01:31:40.000
Well, maybe one or two.

01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:42.041
No. All of them.

01:31:49.709 --> 01:31:50.875
I'm glad I stayed.

01:31:50.959 --> 01:31:52.417
Me, too.

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:57.125
It's a long time since
I so honest with someone.

01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:02.250
I don't feel so alone now.

01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:08.709
No, wait, before you go,
we record this historic moment.

01:32:08.792 --> 01:32:10.500
Huh? Come on.

01:32:10.583 --> 01:32:12.709
Come on, Danny.
Come on, come sit.

01:32:16.083 --> 01:32:17.458
Put that down.

01:32:49.625 --> 01:32:52.542
I cannot wait
to read your article.

01:32:52.625 --> 01:32:55.542
Who knows, maybe it
make me famous again.

01:32:55.625 --> 01:32:57.959
I can't promise anything.

01:32:59.917 --> 01:33:01.417
I fucked up that other job.

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:02.834
I think they fired me.

01:33:04.959 --> 01:33:06.250
But you were right.

01:33:06.333 --> 01:33:08.458
It's a great story.

01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:30.875
You tell them...

01:33:30.959 --> 01:33:33.542
I regret nothing.

01:33:59.625 --> 01:34:01.500
Hervé! Tattoo!

01:34:01.583 --> 01:34:02.875
Do it.

01:34:02.959 --> 01:34:04.959
- Do the thing. You know?
- Ah, no, no, no.

01:34:05.041 --> 01:34:06.208
Come on.

01:34:08.041 --> 01:34:10.500
The plane! The plane!

01:37:01.041 --> 01:37:02.709
Hervé?

01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:10.041
Hervé?

01:37:11.542 --> 01:37:12.875
Hervé?

01:37:32.625 --> 01:37:34.083
Hello?

01:37:34.166 --> 01:37:35.893
Yes, it's Marty Rothstein.

01:37:35.917 --> 01:37:37.667
I'm sorry I have
to tell you this, but...

01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:39.166
What?

01:37:39.250 --> 01:37:41.000
...Hervé's gone.

01:37:41.083 --> 01:37:42.750
He killed himself.

01:37:45.792 --> 01:37:47.083
Jesus.

01:38:09.875 --> 01:38:12.166
It's a brilliant piece.

01:38:12.250 --> 01:38:14.250
Thank you.

01:38:14.333 --> 01:38:16.000
Two pages.
Somewhere in the middle.

01:38:16.083 --> 01:38:17.667
What?

01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:19.333
Five hundred words,
short and funny.

01:38:19.417 --> 01:38:21.375
That's what I asked for.
Not this.

01:38:21.458 --> 01:38:23.125
Fine. I'll take it
somewhere else.

01:38:23.208 --> 01:38:25.542
You can't. We commissioned it.
We own it.

01:38:25.625 --> 01:38:26.976
- Then run it.
- We are running it.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.083
On the cover!

01:38:28.166 --> 01:38:29.750
Two pages.
Somewhere in the middle.

01:38:29.834 --> 01:38:31.667
But...

01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:34.250
please, you can't do that.

01:38:34.333 --> 01:38:36.291
Why?

01:38:38.834 --> 01:38:41.041
Because I promised him.

01:38:41.125 --> 01:38:43.583
You promised him.

01:38:43.667 --> 01:38:47.125
Why on earth would you do
something stupid like that?

01:38:49.333 --> 01:38:51.750
Cheer up. Your little friend
did you a favor.

01:38:51.834 --> 01:38:54.250
You've only got a job
because he killed himself.

01:38:54.333 --> 01:38:56.750
It's a story.

01:38:56.834 --> 01:38:58.667
Now cut it down.

01:39:51.875 --> 01:39:55.166
Well, Tate's topped
a midget.

01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:56.583
Where do we
send him next?

01:40:00.583 --> 01:40:02.208
Let's have a look
at that rewrite then.

01:40:19.542 --> 01:40:22.083
At least let us treat you
to a goodbye drink.

01:40:36.041 --> 01:40:37.125
Fuck!

01:40:48.834 --> 01:40:50.583
Right, get back to work.
