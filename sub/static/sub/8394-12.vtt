WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:02.499
- I HATED AFGHANISTAN,

00:02.550 --> 00:04.780
BUT AT LEAST THERE,
EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.058
I JUST FEEL OUT OF SYNC
HERE STILL.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.579
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DECIDE

00:07.620 --> 00:09.895
WHICH WORLD YOU BELONG IN.

00:09.940 --> 00:11.862
- I WENT BACK,
AND I REENLISTED.

00:11.900 --> 00:15.768
- I HAVE A BUDDY IN ADVERTISING
WHO HIRES PHOTOGRAPHERS.

00:15.800 --> 00:16.869
YOU WOULD ENJOY MEETING HIM.

00:16.910 --> 00:17.592
- HI.
- THIS IS MY FRIEND SARAH.

00:17.630 --> 00:19.074
- SARAH.
- YEAH, CARL TOLD ME

00:19.120 --> 00:20.667
THAT YOUR WORK IS AMAZING.

00:20.710 --> 00:23.019
- I THOUGHT THAT I FELT
SOMETHING FROM YOU.

00:23.050 --> 00:23.778
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

00:23.810 --> 00:24.947
- I'M MARRIED.

00:24.990 --> 00:27.367
- ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH ED?

00:27.400 --> 00:28.606
- NO.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.609
- I HEARD THEY'VE BEEN HAVING
AN AFFAIR FOR MONTHS.

00:32.650 --> 00:34.709
- REALLY?
- YEAH, I MEAN, IT MAKES SENSE.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.570
THEY'RE ON THE SUSTAINABILITY
COMMI'I'I'EE TOGETHER.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.372
DO YOU THINK THAT WAS
AN ACCIDENT?

00:38.410 --> 00:40.549
- NO ONE PICKS THAT COMMITTEE.
- I JUST DON'T GET IT.

00:40.590 --> 00:42.205
JOEL IS
THE GREATEST HUSBAND EVER.

00:42.240 --> 00:42.922
- HE'S SO CUTE.

00:42.970 --> 00:45.131
- HE'S SO SWEET.
- SHH, SHH.

00:45.180 --> 00:47.341
- HI, JULIA.
- HEY.

00:47.390 --> 00:49.529
- [clears throat]
- SO...

00:49.560 --> 00:50.697
[school bell rings]

00:50.740 --> 00:53.459
- BYE.
BYE, VICTOR.

00:55.190 --> 00:57.397
- [laughs]
- LIKE, MAYBE SHE'S JUST--

00:57.430 --> 00:58.658
- PARDON ME.

00:59.950 --> 01:02.817
- THAT WAS AWKWARD.
- OKAY.

01:02.850 --> 01:04.954
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
- ABOUT?

01:04.990 --> 01:06.059
- I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT ME.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.739
HEARD ALL ABOUT IT.
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

01:08.790 --> 01:10.371
- [scoffs]
JULIA, NO.

01:10.410 --> 01:12.753
WE'RE JUST REALLY, UH, UM,
SORRY FOR EVERYTHING

01:12.790 --> 01:14.200
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH YOU.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.992
- NOTHING'S BEEN GOING ON
WITH ME.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.109
I'M NOT HAVING AN AFFAIR.

01:17.140 --> 01:18.687
I'M NOT GETTING A DIVORCE,
SO YOU CAN GET A LIFE,

01:18.730 --> 01:20.311
IF YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE.

01:20.350 --> 01:21.248
- [scoffs]
- AND DON'T TELL ME

01:21.280 --> 01:24.101
THAT YOU'RE SORRY,
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.527
- OKAY.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.425
[doorbell rings]

01:28.460 --> 01:29.700
- HI.
- CAN I COME IN?

01:29.740 --> 01:30.729
- UH, CAN I PRETEND
I'M NOT WEARING PAJAMAS?

01:30.780 --> 01:33.499
- CAN WE PRETEND
YOU'RE WEARING NOTHING AT ALL?

01:33.540 --> 01:35.155
- COME IN, CARL.
- [chuckles]

01:35.190 --> 01:36.771
UH, SO YOU REMEMBER ALEC

01:36.820 --> 01:38.390
FROM THAT PARTY?
- YEAH.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.123
- HE WAS ASKING ABOUT YOU
FOR A JOB.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.297
HE WANTS TO INTERVIEW YOU.

01:41.340 --> 01:42.238
- FOR WHAT?
- SURFSPORT.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.124
YOU EVER HEARD OF THEM?
- [gasps] YES,

01:44.170 --> 01:46.638
I'VE HEARD OF SURFSPORT.
I DON'T LIVE UNDERGROUND.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.237
- WELL, YOU SORT OF DO.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.794
ANYWAY, ALEC SAID
IT'S SOME HUGE CAMPAIGN.

01:50.830 --> 01:53.037
I TOLD HIM I THOUGHT YOUR WORK
WAS FANTASTIC,

01:53.070 --> 01:54.822
AND HE WANTS TO SIT DOWN
WITH YOU.

01:54.870 --> 01:59.239
- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HANDLE
AN ACCOUNT LIKE SURFSPORT.

01:59.290 --> 02:01.975
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE THEY'RE HUGE.

02:02.010 --> 02:04.285
I DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE.
I DON'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT.

02:04.330 --> 02:06.116
- I THINK YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
I MEAN, THE ONLY REASON

02:06.160 --> 02:07.604
YOU HAVEN'T DONE A JOB
THIS BIG BEFORE

02:07.640 --> 02:11.189
IS BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T DONE
A JOB THIS BIG BEFORE, RIGHT?

02:11.230 --> 02:12.674
CAN I GIVE HIM
YOUR PHONE NUMBER,

02:12.710 --> 02:15.224
JUST HAVE HIM CALL YOU?
- SURE.

02:15.270 --> 02:15.838
- GOOD.
- GOOD.

02:15.890 --> 02:17.949
- SEE YOU.
- [laughs]

02:17.990 --> 02:20.788
- BLUE 41! RED DOG!
HUT, HUT, HIKE!

02:20.830 --> 02:22.616
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THE HOUSE?

02:22.650 --> 02:24.754
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
WHY IS THERE A MOTORCYCLE

02:24.790 --> 02:26.724
IN OUR DRIVEWAY?

02:26.760 --> 02:28.580
- OH, THAT'S OLIVER.

02:28.630 --> 02:31.212
OH, MAN, I BET HE'S HERE
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE BAND.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.478
THEY'RE BICKERING
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

02:32.530 --> 02:34.100
HERE, WILL YOU TAKE HER?
- WHY IS HE COMING HERE?

02:34.150 --> 02:36.038
- HE LOOKS COOL.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.593
- HEY.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.019
- WHAT'S UP, CROSBY?
WE GOT A BIT OF A PROBLEM, BRO.

02:41.050 --> 02:42.563
MRS. CROSBY.
- HELLO.

02:42.610 --> 02:43.736
- SPAWN OF CROSBY.
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

02:43.780 --> 02:45.873
- THE BAND AND I
ARE IN A HUGE FIGHT.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.740
- ABOUT WHAT?
- ABOUT THEM BEING JACKASSES.

02:47.780 --> 02:49.987
AND I'M NOT GONNA PLAY
ANOTHER SONG UNTIL--

02:50.030 --> 02:53.056
- [clears throat]
- BU'I'I' FACES.

02:53.100 --> 02:55.443
I WILL NOT FINISH
RECORDING THIS RECORD

02:55.480 --> 02:56.401
UNTIL THEY APOLOGIZE TO ME.

02:56.450 --> 02:58.099
I MEAN, THEY'RE TRYING
TO GET IN MY HEAD,

02:58.140 --> 03:00.608
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
IN THIS HEAD MOST OF THE TIME.

03:00.660 --> 03:02.582
AND SO THEY KICKED ME
OUT OF THE HOUSE,

03:02.630 --> 03:04.131
AND I DON'T KNOW
ANYBODY ELSE IN TOWN...

03:04.180 --> 03:05.169
[baby crying]
'CAUSE I'VE JUST BEEN

03:05.210 --> 03:07.417
FOCUSING ON MY ART
THIS WHOLE TIME,

03:07.460 --> 03:09.667
50 WHO AM I GONNA MEET?
I KNOW YOU,

03:09.700 --> 03:12.498
AND YOU CAN MAYBE LET ME CRASH
FOR A COUPLE DAYS,

03:12.530 --> 03:14.464
AND THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
THAT WOULD BE SO SWEET.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.229
- YEAH,
A FEW DAYS IS GREAT.

03:16.260 --> 03:17.704
- OH, NICE!
- JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.367
THAT'LL WORK, YEAH.
- A FEW, AWESOME.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.436
THAT'S IT, AND I GOT TO GET
THE REST OF MY STUFF.

03:21.470 --> 03:22.812
I COULDN'T FIT IT ON MY BIKE.

03:22.850 --> 03:24.989
SO, IF YOU COULD TAKE
THE MINIVAN MACHINE

03:25.030 --> 03:26.361
AND WE COULD JUST DO A QUICK--

03:26.410 --> 03:29.026
- YOU ALSO NEED ME TO MOVE.
UH-HUH. OH--ALL RIGHT.

03:29.070 --> 03:29.855
- YOU'RE ALL I GOT.
DUDE!

03:29.890 --> 03:32.541
YOU AND ME--BUNKMATES.

03:32.590 --> 03:33.443
- EH, PROBABLY NOT BUNKMATES.
- I MEAN,

03:33.480 --> 03:34.686
FLASHLIGHTS
UNDER BLANKETS AND STUFF?

03:34.730 --> 03:37.551
- YEAH, SOUNDS--

03:37.590 --> 03:38.579
- NO.

03:47.050 --> 03:49.666
- HEY.

03:49.710 --> 03:52.224
MAX?

03:52.260 --> 03:54.319
MAX.

03:54.370 --> 03:55.632
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET ME

03:55.680 --> 03:57.841
20 MINUTES AGO
IN THE PARKING LOT.

04:00.480 --> 04:04.644
YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

04:04.690 --> 04:07.204
- WHERE'S THE REST
OF THE YEARBOOK CLUB?

04:07.240 --> 04:08.855
- I DON'T KNOW.
- DON'T KNOW?

04:08.900 --> 04:09.924
WHAT ABOUT MR. CARLSON?
WHERE IS HE?

04:09.970 --> 04:13.315
- I DON'T KNOW.
- OKAY.

04:13.350 --> 04:14.829
HEY, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
WHAT'S UP, MICAH?

04:14.870 --> 04:17.521
WHAT'S GOING ON, BUD?

04:19.700 --> 04:22.043
MAX, WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.217
- THAT WAS MICAH,
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

04:23.260 --> 04:25.911
YOU GUYS JUST WENT BY EACH OTHER
AND DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

04:25.950 --> 04:30.637
- NO, WE'RE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE.
- SINCE WHEN?

04:30.680 --> 04:33.296
MAX, WHAT HAPPENED?
- I DON'T KNOW.

04:33.340 --> 04:36.400
WE HAVE TO GET TO HANK'S.

04:41.210 --> 04:43.485
- [sighs]

04:43.520 --> 04:45.988
[knock at door]
- HEY.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.838
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU'RE 1/2 HOUR EARLY.

04:48.870 --> 04:52.385
- OH, SORRY.

04:52.430 --> 04:54.978
- IT'S FINE.

04:55.010 --> 04:57.251
UH, MOST OF YOUR STUFF
IS IN THOSE BOXES.

04:57.290 --> 04:58.905
- OKAY, THANKS.
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO

04:58.950 --> 05:01.327
A DOUBLE-CHECK, LIKE, AROUND
THE BATHROOM OR SOMETHING,

05:01.370 --> 05:03.770
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
THERE MIGHT BE SOME STUFF

05:03.820 --> 05:04.912
THAT I MISSED, SO...

05:04.950 --> 05:05.678
AND IF YOU COULD JUST LEAVE
THE KEYS ON THE TABLE,

05:05.710 --> 05:08.270
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
- YEAH.

05:08.300 --> 05:08.982
- ALL RIGHT.
- ARE YOU LEAVING?

05:09.030 --> 05:10.713
- YEAH, I AM.
I'M LEAVING.

05:10.750 --> 05:11.887
I WASN'T EVEN GONNA BE HERE,

05:11.930 --> 05:14.717
BUT YOU CAME 1/2 HOUR EARLY,
SO...

05:14.760 --> 05:18.275
- DO YOU WANT TO TALK
OR ANYTHING?

05:18.310 --> 05:20.790
- IT'S A LITTLE LATE TO TALK,
ISN'T IT?

05:20.830 --> 05:23.037
GO AHEAD, THOUGH,
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.243
- IT'S JUST--
I-I MEAN, I MAY NOT SEE YOU

05:26.290 --> 05:28.497
BEFORE I--

05:28.530 --> 05:31.499
- WHAT--WHAT'S LEFI'?

05:31.530 --> 05:34.875
[melancholy song]

05:34.920 --> 05:40.199
- FORGIVE ME

05:46.930 --> 05:50.400
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

05:50.450 --> 05:52.896
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

05:52.930 --> 05:55.376
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

05:55.420 --> 05:56.864
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

05:56.900 --> 06:00.381
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

06:00.420 --> 06:02.388
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

06:02.430 --> 06:04.455
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:04.500 --> 06:07.526
FOREVER YOUNG

06:07.570 --> 06:10.118
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

06:10.160 --> 06:12.390
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

06:12.440 --> 06:14.772
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:14.820 --> 06:16.959
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

06:16.990 --> 06:18.742
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:18.790 --> 06:20.951
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:21.000 --> 06:23.992
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:24.030 --> 06:25.895
FOREVER YOUNG

06:25.930 --> 06:27.921
MAY YOU STAY

06:27.970 --> 06:30.962
FOREVER YOUNG

06:33.460 --> 06:35.690
- MAYBE HE DIDN'T SEE YOU GUYS.
- NO, HE SAW US.

06:35.740 --> 06:36.900
I SAID, "HEY, MICAH."

06:36.940 --> 06:38.498
I COULD SEE HIM SEEING US
OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE.

06:38.530 --> 06:39.497
HE JUST KEPT ON ROLLING.

06:39.530 --> 06:41.418
- IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
IT JUST DOESN'T.

06:41.470 --> 06:43.017
- WHEN I ASKED MAX ABOUT IT
ALL MAX SAID WAS,

06:43.050 --> 06:44.153
"WE'RE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE."

06:44.190 --> 06:46.078
- I MEAN, HE HASN'T BEEN
OVER HERE IN A LONG TIME,

06:46.120 --> 06:48.327
YOU KNOW, BUTI FIGURED
THEY'RE STILL FRIENDS.

06:48.370 --> 06:49.359
I JUST FEEL
LIKE THIS IS MY FAULT

06:49.400 --> 06:51.789
BECAUSE I USED TO HELP
FACILITATE THE PLAYDATES

06:51.820 --> 06:52.889
AND STUFF,
AND HE WAS COMING OVER.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.854
SINCE THIS ELECTION'S BEEN
TAKING OVER OUR LIVES,

06:54.890 --> 06:57.996
IT'S LIKE--
- IT MIGHT BE YOUR FAULT.

06:58.030 --> 06:59.713
- ADAM.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.409
- HOPEFULLY, IT'S SOMETHING
SMALL AND FIXABLE.

07:01.450 --> 07:02.587
- WHAT IF I CALLED HIS PARENTS?

07:02.620 --> 07:05.248
WHAT IF I CALLED THEM AND JUST
EXPLAINED THE SITUATION?

07:05.280 --> 07:07.487
MAYBE THEY KNOW SOMETHING
WE DON'T.

07:07.530 --> 07:08.758
THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE.
- LOOK, MAX IS A LITTLE OLD

07:08.800 --> 07:09.789
FOR US TO BE CALLING
HIS FRIENDS' PARENTS.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.933
- WELL, HE'S NOT GONNA TELL US
WHAT'S GOING ON.

07:11.980 --> 07:13.766
IT'S HIS ONLY FRIEND, ADAM.
- HE MIGHT. GIVE ME A SHOT.

07:13.810 --> 07:15.038
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE

07:15.080 --> 07:17.844
AND I'LL SEE IF I CAN GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF IT WITH MAX, OKAY?

07:20.540 --> 07:22.223
- ALL RIGHT.

07:22.260 --> 07:23.579
- DELICIOUS, AMAZING.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.498
- MMM.
IT REALLY WAS, HONEY, SO GOOD.

07:25.540 --> 07:27.098
- JABBAR, CAN YOU
CLEAR THE TABLE, PLEASE?

07:27.130 --> 07:28.779
- YEAH.
- GOD.

07:28.820 --> 07:30.754
FAMILY DINNER--
THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE.

07:30.790 --> 07:31.996
- IT'S NICE, RIGHT?
- I LONGED FOR THIS

07:32.030 --> 07:33.998
MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD.
- [chuckles]

07:34.030 --> 07:36.169
- THIS IS, LIKE,
A MELANGE OF PEOPLE,

07:36.210 --> 07:39.623
JUST FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD,
DIFFERENT RACES,

07:39.660 --> 07:41.890
COMING TOGETHER EATING CHOW.
- NORMAN ROCKWELL, RIGHT?

07:41.940 --> 07:43.760
- BREAKING BREAD.
WE'RE BREAKING BREAD

07:43.800 --> 07:45.074
WITH EACH OTHER.
THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

07:45.110 --> 07:47.692
- YEAH, IT'S GLUTEN-FREE.
- EVEN BETI'ER, MAN.

07:47.740 --> 07:48.832
- THIS IS INSPIRING.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.461
THIS IS, LIKE,
LIGHT BULB INSPIRATION.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.808
I NEED A PIECE OF PAPER.
I NEED SOME PAPER.

07:51.850 --> 07:53.670
- YOU WANT PAPER?
- PAPER, PEN.

07:53.710 --> 07:55.769
PAPER, PEN, PLEASE.
- YEAH, HONEY, I THINK THERE'S--

07:55.820 --> 07:57.959
HEY, OLIVER, NOT TO INTERRUPT
YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS HERE,

07:57.990 --> 08:01.164
BUT HAVE YOU SPOKEN
TO THE REST OF THE BAND?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.986
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH...

08:03.030 --> 08:06.716
- YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY
JUST DOESN'T GET IT?

08:06.760 --> 08:08.785
THAT'S MY BAND.
NONE OF THEM GET IT.

08:08.830 --> 08:11.515
I JUST LOOK AT THEM, AND I'M
LIKE, "YOU'RE SO IMMATURE.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.061
YOU'RE SO CHILDISH."

08:13.110 --> 08:14.896
THEY JUST THINK
WE'RE MAKING A RECORD.

08:14.940 --> 08:16.931
WE'RE JUST MAKING A RECORD.
IT'S NOT DESTINY.

08:16.970 --> 08:18.210
IT'S NOT MY LIFE.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.138
NOW I'M DEPRESSED.
- WELL, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

08:20.180 --> 08:22.569
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN I'M SAD,
I LIKE TO GO DOWN TO THE STUDIO

08:22.600 --> 08:24.875
AND LET IT OUT, YOU KNOW,
KIND OF LIKE A RELEASE.

08:24.910 --> 08:25.979
YOU KNOW,
IT'S KIND OF CATHARTIC.

08:26.020 --> 08:28.397
- YEAH, I SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE.

08:28.430 --> 08:29.840
- YEAH.
- WHAT'S THAT?

08:29.880 --> 08:31.120
- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO SMOKE THAT IN THIS HOUSE.

08:31.160 --> 08:35.051
- OH, NO, NO, IT'S NOT POT.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE CIGARETTE.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.364
- GOT YA.
- NOW, THIS, MY FRIEND,

08:37.410 --> 08:40.026
IS FINE QUALITY BALI SHAG.

08:40.070 --> 08:42.163
NOW, IF YOU'RE GONNA SMOKE,
DON'T BUY CIGARETTES.

08:42.210 --> 08:44.792
YOU GOT TO ROLL 'EM
JUST LIKE OUR FOREFATHERS DID.

08:44.830 --> 08:46.036
- OKAY.
- NO, DON'T--

08:46.070 --> 08:47.480
DON'T TELL HIM THAT.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.828
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA SMOKE.

08:48.870 --> 08:50.485
SECOND OF ALL, YOU'RE NOT
SMOKING IN THIS HOUSE,

08:50.530 --> 08:52.521
SO TAKE IT OUTSIDE.
- BUT CROSBY AND I--

08:52.560 --> 08:54.141
- CROSBY--WHAT?
- WHAT DOES CROSBY DO?

08:54.180 --> 08:54.930
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- OH, NOTHING, NOTHING.

08:54.980 --> 08:57.039
- ARE YOU SMOKING?
- NO! WHAT?

08:57.080 --> 08:58.286
- NO, NO, NO,
I GOT TO GO ANYWAYS.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.638
- WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

08:59.670 --> 09:00.705
- IT'S OKAY,
I GOT TO GO ANYWAYS.

09:00.740 --> 09:01.707
I GOT TO VISIT A YOUNG LADY,
TUCK HER INTO BED.

09:01.740 --> 09:04.675
- MM, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
STAY THERE TONIGHT.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.814
- I'M NOT GIVING THAT LADY
THE WRONG IDEA.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.226
COME ON.
- [chuckles] OF COURSE NOT.

09:08.270 --> 09:09.817
- ANYWAY, I'M GONNA BE LATE,

09:09.850 --> 09:11.124
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO LOCK
THE DOOR OR KEEP IT UNLOCKED,

09:11.170 --> 09:13.434
OR ELSE I'M GONNA BREAK IN.
- YOU DEFINITELY WON'T DO THAT.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.232
- WE'LL CHOOSE
THE UNLOCKED OPTION.

09:15.270 --> 09:17.989
- SEE YOU, FAM, LOVE YOU!
- OLIVER ROME IS SO COOL.

09:18.040 --> 09:18.756
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING
FOR THE HOLIDAYS?

09:18.790 --> 09:20.894
- WHAT?
- HE AND YOUR MOTHER

09:20.930 --> 09:22.318
STAYING HERE ALL AT ONCE,

09:22.350 --> 09:23.578
BUNK BEDS.
- [laughing]

09:23.630 --> 09:25.006
- [gaSPSJ
YEAH!

09:29.530 --> 09:32.044
- HEY.
- HEY.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.559
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- GOOD. CAN I COME IN?

09:33.600 --> 09:35.568
- YEAH.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.601
- THANK YOU.

09:36.640 --> 09:40.155
WHEN YOU HEADED OUT?
- WEDNESDAY.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.326
FORT LEWIS.
- OH.

09:41.370 --> 09:42.462
- YEAH.

09:42.510 --> 09:45.058
- YOU'RE FLYING?
- DRIVING.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.613
- DRIVING.

09:46.650 --> 09:49.027
WELL, IT'S CRAPPY WEATHER
UP THERE, ALL RIGHT.

09:49.070 --> 09:50.378
- YEAH.

09:50.410 --> 09:54.892
- IT JUST RAINS ALL THE TIME,
JUST PISSES ALL OVER YOU.

09:54.930 --> 09:56.488
- YEAH.

09:56.520 --> 10:01.105
- THE REASON I CAME BY
WAS TO...

10:01.150 --> 10:03.766
TO TELL YOU THAT I HOPE
WHAT I SAID THE OTHER NIGHT

10:03.810 --> 10:06.119
ISN'T THE REASON
WHY YOU REENLISTED.

10:06.150 --> 10:07.458
- NO. NO, IT'S--
- BECAUSE I DON'T WANT AMBER

10:07.500 --> 10:10.708
TO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,
IT WAS ME THAT--

10:10.740 --> 10:13.152
- NO, ZEEK, IT WASN'T.

10:13.190 --> 10:16.648
AND I'LL FIND SOME WAY OF
MAKING SURE THAT SHE KNOWS THAT.

10:20.300 --> 10:23.064
THE MILITARY IS MY LIFE NOW.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.989
YOU KNOW, I WANTED AMBER
TO BE MY LIFE

10:26.030 --> 10:28.681
AND BERKELEY
AND YOUR WHOLE FAMILY AND...

10:31.250 --> 10:36.108
YOU KNOW I LOVE HER
SO MUCH, BUT...

10:36.150 --> 10:39.938
I DON'T, UH, KNOW
THAT I'M GOOD FOR HER.

10:41.360 --> 10:45.876
HOW IS SHE?
- YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER?

10:45.920 --> 10:48.491
- NO.

10:48.540 --> 10:51.748
NO, SHE, UH,
SHE'S PRETTY MAD.

10:51.780 --> 10:53.054
- WELL, YOU'RE LEAVING.

10:53.100 --> 10:57.309
- YEAH, I KNOW.
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO ME.

10:59.650 --> 11:03.609
- [sighs]

11:03.660 --> 11:06.276
THAT'S SAD.

11:08.490 --> 11:13.006
I DON'T KNOW. OKAY.

11:13.050 --> 11:15.382
- HEY, ZEEK.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.463
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

11:23.130 --> 11:26.156
YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH FOR ME.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.686
- GODSPEED, RYAN.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.970
- HEY.
- CAN YOU TAKE A MINUTE?

11:52.020 --> 11:54.636
- YEAH.

11:54.670 --> 11:57.776
- [sighs]

12:02.610 --> 12:04.168
YOU KNOW, UM...

12:08.380 --> 12:10.996
I'VE BEEN...

12:12.140 --> 12:16.383
[voice breaking]
PRETTY UNHAPPY...

12:16.420 --> 12:19.002
SINCE I LEI-T WORK.

12:20.870 --> 12:24.112
AND, UH, ED WAS
GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING,

12:24.150 --> 12:26.801
SO...

12:26.840 --> 12:30.150
THAT'S BASICALLY
HOW WE BECAME FRIENDS.

12:32.890 --> 12:36.018
YOU WERE SO MAD AT ME
WHEN VICTOR GOT HELD BACK,

12:36.060 --> 12:38.574
WHICH I-I UNDERSTAND.

12:38.610 --> 12:40.749
THAT DIDN'T GO DOWN RIGHT.

12:40.790 --> 12:44.203
BUT, YOU KNOW, ED AND I
TALKED ABOUT THAT TOO,

12:44.240 --> 12:45.207
AND THAT'S--
YOU SAW ALL THOSE TEXTS.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.891
THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT.
WE WERE JUST--

12:47.930 --> 12:51.172
IT WAS SO ROUGH ON US.

12:58.260 --> 13:00.182
JOEL, UM...

13:02.920 --> 13:04.808
ED GOT CONFUSED

13:04.850 --> 13:08.638
ABOUT THE NATURE
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP,

13:08.680 --> 13:10.602
CLEARLY, BECAUSE...

13:10.650 --> 13:13.118
[sighs]
HE KISSED ME.

13:13.170 --> 13:15.809
YOU KNOW, AND I STOPPED IT,

13:15.860 --> 13:18.169
AND HE HASN'T
TRIED TO DO IT AGAIN.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.133
- I THOUGHT YOU--

13:23.180 --> 13:26.104
YOU SAID NOTHING HAPPENED.

13:26.150 --> 13:28.653
- WELL, FROM MY SIDE OF IT,
NOTHING HAPPENED, YOU KNOW,

13:28.700 --> 13:31.214
FROM MY--
- SO...

13:31.250 --> 13:35.357
- FOR ME.
- WHERE? WHERE WAS THIS?

13:35.400 --> 13:38.289
- THIS WAS AT HIS HOUSE.

13:38.330 --> 13:40.844
I HAD GONE--
- YOU WENT TO HIS HOUSE?

13:40.880 --> 13:42.324
WHEN?
- I DID. THIS IS--

13:42.370 --> 13:44.122
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO
I WENT OVER THERE

13:44.160 --> 13:47.027
BECAUSE I STARTED
TO GET THE SENSE

13:47.060 --> 13:50.336
THAT HE WAS MISUNDERSTANDING.
- SO LET ME--LET ME JUST...

13:51.200 --> 13:54.897
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
YOU, UH...

13:54.930 --> 13:58.172
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING,
UM, A-A...

13:58.210 --> 14:01.202
AN EMOTIONAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH--WITH ED,

14:01.250 --> 14:03.696
SOME SORT OF EMOTIONAL AFFAIR
WITH ED...

14:03.730 --> 14:05.049
- A FRIENDSHIP.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.310
- AND THEN
YOU GO OVER TO HIS HOUSE.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.284
CLEARLY, HE'S SEPARATED
FROM HIS WIFE,

14:10.330 --> 14:12.116
AND YOU GO OVER,
AND HE KISSES YOU...

14:12.160 --> 14:14.799
- YES.
- AND WHEN I ASK YOU

14:14.850 --> 14:16.124
ABOUT ANYTHING HAPPENING--

14:16.160 --> 14:18.219
[sighs]
I BEGGED YOU.

14:18.270 --> 14:21.819
I BEGGED YOU TO TELL ME
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED,

14:21.860 --> 14:24.328
AND YOU SAID, "NOTHING."
- I SAID, "NOTHING,"

14:24.380 --> 14:25.267
BECAUSE FROM MY POINT OF VIEW...
- WHY?

14:25.310 --> 14:27.642
- IT WAS NOTHING
AND BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT

14:27.690 --> 14:29.419
TO UNNECESSARILY UPSET YOU.
- WHY WOULD YOU THINK

14:29.450 --> 14:30.963
THAT THAT IS NOTHING?

14:31.000 --> 14:35.585
- FOR ME, UM, UM--
FROM ME TO HIM, IT WAS NOTHING.

14:35.630 --> 14:37.177
[thud]

14:37.220 --> 14:39.859
- [sobs]

14:54.580 --> 14:57.026
- I LOVE THE BIRD.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.027
- OH, YEAH,
THAT WAS A GREAT SHOT.

14:58.060 --> 15:02.474
- SO, UH, TELL ME, HANK,
ANY CHANCE YOU SURF?

15:02.520 --> 15:04.476
- NO. I DON'T.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.557
I TRIED IT ONCE
AND, UH, HATED IT.

15:07.590 --> 15:08.579
YEAH.

15:08.630 --> 15:10.245
BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO GO
TO THE BEACH FOR THIS.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.929
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
BECAUSE THE BEACH ONES--

15:11.980 --> 15:12.628
YOU'RE GONNA RUN
INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE

15:12.670 --> 15:17.289
WITH LENS AND SAND AND WIND.

15:17.330 --> 15:18.638
SUN'S GONNA GO DOWN--THAT'S
GONNA BE A BIG PAIN IN THE ASS

15:18.670 --> 15:20.638
WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN.
- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

15:20.670 --> 15:25.607
SO YOU WOULDN'T DO
SURFING SHOTS FOR SURFSPORT?

15:25.640 --> 15:28.712
- YOU DON'T--YOU DON'T DO THAT
FOR THIS KIND OF SHOOT.

15:28.750 --> 15:32.265
I MEAN--YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
BETWEEN ME AND YOU, IT'S--

15:32.310 --> 15:35.029
YOU'RE NOT DOING ART HERE.
YOU'RE DOING A BROCHURE.

15:35.070 --> 15:37.231
AND YOU GOT A BUDGET,
AND YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO BE

15:37.280 --> 15:38.508
IN THE STUDIO FOR THIS ONE.

15:38.550 --> 15:40.723
- YEAH, THIS IS
REALLY GOOD STUFF,

15:40.760 --> 15:44.548
AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU
AS SOON AS WE KNOW SOMETHING.

15:44.590 --> 15:46.694
THANK YOU.

15:46.730 --> 15:47.287
- OKAY.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.288
[elevator bell dings]

15:53.740 --> 15:55.844
HEY.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.393
- HI.
- HEY.

15:57.430 --> 15:59.011
- HI.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:59.060 --> 16:01.085
- [chuckles]
NICE TO SEE YOU TOO.

16:01.130 --> 16:04.748
- YEAH. NO, I'M--
WHAT'S UP?

16:04.790 --> 16:06.405
- I HAVE AN INTERVIEW.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.328
- W-WHERE?

16:08.380 --> 16:11.508
- UH, SURFSPORT.
- SURFSP--

16:11.550 --> 16:13.689
[chuckles]
THAT'S JUST WHERE I WAS.

16:13.730 --> 16:15.869
- OH, MY GOD!
- YOU'RE INTERVIEWING THERE?

16:15.900 --> 16:16.798
I DON'T GET IT.
- YEAH.

16:16.830 --> 16:19.003
I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE NOW.
- SERIOUSLY?

16:19.040 --> 16:21.838
- YES, SERIOUSLY.
- HOW DID--

16:21.870 --> 16:24.350
[chuckles] I MEAN--
- SO SURPRISED.

16:24.390 --> 16:26.802
- YOU'RE BRINGING
YOUR PICTURES OF DOGS, RIGHT?

16:26.840 --> 16:28.046
I DON'T--

16:28.090 --> 16:29.216
- I HAVE LOTS
OF DIFFERENT PICTURES,

16:29.260 --> 16:31.353
AND I HAVE AN INTERVIEW. WHY--
- NO, I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.844
BUT HOW DID YOU GET IT?
I DON'T GET IT.

16:32.880 --> 16:33.847
- SARAH.
- WHO CARE--

16:33.880 --> 16:35.154
HI!
- SARAH, HI.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.839
- ALEC, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

16:37.890 --> 16:39.164
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
UH, MY BROTHERS

16:39.200 --> 16:41.612
ARE SO EXCITED I'M HERE.

16:41.650 --> 16:43.572
- WELL, I'M EXCITED
THAT YOU'RE HERE AS WELL.

16:43.620 --> 16:45.303
THANKS FOR COMING IN.
- THEY ARE HUGE FANS.

16:45.340 --> 16:48.412
- SO, I MEAN, AS YOU WILL SEE,
WE'VE MADE THE ADJUSTMENT

16:48.450 --> 16:49.519
FOR THE STEP DOWN
FROM THE LIVING ROOM

16:49.560 --> 16:52.688
INTO THE KITCHEN, AND--
BUT I THINK ALL IT'S DONE

16:52.730 --> 16:56.723
IS JUST MADE THIS VIEW
EVEN MORE SPECTACULAR.

16:56.770 --> 16:59.625
- LOVE IT.
- OH, GOOD. GREAT.

16:59.670 --> 17:03.151
WELL, WE'VE LOST A TINY BIT
OF SPACE IN THE KITCHEN,

17:03.190 --> 17:04.737
BUT I THINK THAT
BETWEEN THE SLIDING DOORS

17:04.780 --> 17:06.600
AND ALL THIS SUNLIGHT, IT'S JUST
GOING TO FEEL EVEN BIGGER.

17:06.640 --> 17:11.156
- HOW MANY SQUARE FEET
DID WE LOSE EXACTLY?

17:11.200 --> 17:14.294
- UH...SORRY.

17:14.340 --> 17:16.547
6. WE LOST 6 SQUARE FEET.
- BUT 6 USELESS SQUARE FEET.

17:16.580 --> 17:18.377
I MEAN, IT WAS
BETWEEN THE REFRIGERATOR

17:18.410 --> 17:20.298
AND THE BREAKFAST BAR.
I'M ACTUALLY STANDING IN IT.

17:20.340 --> 17:21.409
YOU JUST WON'T MISS IT.
- AND WHAT'S THE BUDGET CHANGE

17:21.450 --> 17:24.556
PER UNIT?

17:24.590 --> 17:26.694
- THAT'S--SORRY. UH...

17:26.730 --> 17:28.789
I'VE GOT IT. UM...

17:28.840 --> 17:30.694
- JOEL'S NUMBERS ARE TOTALLY OFF
'CAUSE I ASKED HIM

17:30.730 --> 17:33.312
TO CHANGE ALL THE COUNTERTOPS,
SO I TELL YOU WHAT--

17:33.360 --> 17:36.591
WE'LL GET YOU A NEW BREAKDOWN
AND A NEW BUDGET TONIGHT.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.084
OKAY?
- SURE.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.395
- GOOD. OKAY. COME,
I WANT TO SHOW YOU UPSTAIRS.

17:40.430 --> 17:44.434
IT'S SO SEXY, THIS HOUSE.
IT IS JUST MAGNIFICENT.

17:44.470 --> 17:47.268
[doorbell rings, knock at door]
- WHO IS IT?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.609
- IT'S ME.
- UGH.

17:49.650 --> 17:52.369
- HOW'D YOU GET THAT INTERVIEW?
- [laughs]

17:52.410 --> 17:53.991
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
- I'M JUST ASKING.

17:54.030 --> 17:55.611
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- CAN I COME IN?

17:55.660 --> 17:57.275
- YOU CAME OVER? YES.
- I'M GONNA COME IN,

17:57.310 --> 17:58.516
'CAUSE THIS IS BOTHERING ME
A LITTLE BIT.

17:58.560 --> 17:59.652
- WHAT ABOUT THE PHONE?
JUST CALL ME.

17:59.690 --> 18:00.793
- I'M JUST WONDERING HOW--

18:00.830 --> 18:02.582
YOU KNOW, I HEARD YOU SAY,
"GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN."

18:02.630 --> 18:03.722
WHEN DID YOU SEE THAT GUY?
- I COULD TELL.

18:03.770 --> 18:06.523
I COULD TELL THAT YOU WERE UPSET
WHEN WE WERE THERE.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.074
- I'M NOT UPSET.
I'M A FRIEND. I'M A FRIEND.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.452
I'M A PHOTOGRAPHER,
FELLOW PHOTOGRAPHER,

18:11.500 --> 18:15.152
WONDERING
HOW YOU GOT IN THAT LOOP.

18:15.190 --> 18:17.124
- I WAS REFERRED BY A FRIEND.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.639
- WHAT FRIEND KNEW HIM? WHO?
I DON'T GET IT.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.079
- WHY DO YOU CARE?
WHY DOES IT MATTER?

18:20.130 --> 18:21.677
- I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.

18:21.720 --> 18:22.880
I'M JUST WONDERING HOW YOU ARE
IN THE SAME CIRCLE--THAT'S ALL.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.195
I MEAN, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

18:25.240 --> 18:26.719
I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU GOT IN THERE.

18:26.760 --> 18:30.093
- CARL, WHO YOU MET THE OTHER
NIGHT, WAS MY FRIEND WHO--

18:30.140 --> 18:32.279
- TUX GUY? MR. TUX?
- MR. TUX.

18:32.310 --> 18:35.313
- REALLY?
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, NOW I GET IT.

18:35.350 --> 18:36.931
- OH, DO YOU?
WHAT?

18:36.970 --> 18:39.791
- [chuckles] COME ON.
- COME ON, WHAT?

18:39.840 --> 18:41.216
I'M NOT GOING OUT WITH CARL.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.662
- SO YOU'RE QUALIFIED
FOR THAT JOB, THEN?

18:43.700 --> 18:45.076
- I THINK I AM, YEAH.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.008
- WHAT KIND OF LENS YOU USE
FOR A SUNSET?

18:47.050 --> 18:49.939
- YOU DON'T--I DON'T HAVE TO
PASS YOUR LITTLE TESTS, OKAY?

18:49.990 --> 18:51.127
- WHAT LENS YOU GONNA USE?

18:51.160 --> 18:52.536
WHAT KIND OF LENS
ARE YOU GONNA USE?

18:52.570 --> 18:53.958
- HANK, I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO MAYBE GO.

18:53.990 --> 18:55.981
- YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL,
ALL RIGHT?

18:56.030 --> 18:57.713
CAREFUL WITH YOUR "GAME SHOW
HOST" NEIGHBOR, ALL RIGHT?

18:57.750 --> 18:58.648
- WHAT ARE YOU WARNING ME?
HE'S NOT A GAME SHOW HOST.

18:58.680 --> 19:02.400
HE'S A DOCTOR, IF YOU MUST KNOW.
[sighs]

19:02.450 --> 19:04.133
- YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR HE IS.

19:04.170 --> 19:06.206
- GOOD-BYE.

19:07.590 --> 19:08.579
- HEY, WHAT WAS THAT?
- SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.

19:08.630 --> 19:09.619
- IT WASN'T EVEN
A HARD QUESTION.

19:09.660 --> 19:12.003
IT WAS A BASIC ONE.
- I KNOW.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.416
I'M--I'M DOING
THE REPORT RIGHT NOW.

19:13.460 --> 19:14.836
- JOEL, I'VE PUT
A TON OF FAITH IN YOU.

19:14.870 --> 19:16.804
YOU NEARLY SCREWED THIS UP.
THAT IS THE PROTOTYPE.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.839
- YES, YES, I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.986
I JUST--I HAVEN'T
BEEN SLEEPING WELL LATELY

19:24.020 --> 19:27.672
AND, UH, MY--MY MARRIAGE...
- RIGHT.

19:27.710 --> 19:29.883
I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT I DON'T CARE.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.639
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
YOUR PERSONAL PROBLEMS, JOEL.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.261
I DON'T. THIS IS YOUR JOB,
AND IT'S A BIG ONE,

19:34.310 --> 19:36.449
$0 GET IT TOGETHER, OKAY?

19:38.830 --> 19:40.582
[door slams]

19:53.980 --> 19:55.902
- HEY, MAX.

19:57.470 --> 19:59.188
HEY, THAT'S A GOOD PICTURE.
I LIKE THAT.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.369
- NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S ALL OUT OF FOCUS.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.881
OTIS RUINED IT. OTIS SUCKS.
WE NEED A NEW DOG.

20:04.920 --> 20:07.741
- WELL, I THINK WE'RE STUCK
WITH OTIS, SO...

20:07.790 --> 20:11.203
HEY, LISTEN...

20:11.240 --> 20:15.199
I WANTED TO TALK WITH YOU...

20:15.240 --> 20:17.686
ABOUT YOU AND MICAH.

20:17.730 --> 20:18.890
- WHY?

20:18.940 --> 20:22.068
- WELL, BECAUSE MICAH'S
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

20:22.110 --> 20:23.862
- NO, HANK IS.

20:23.910 --> 20:27.209
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
HANK'S AN ADULT, SO...

20:27.260 --> 20:29.774
- SO? THAT'S NOT RELEVANT.
- IT IS RELEVANT.

20:29.810 --> 20:32.392
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU
TO HAVE FRIENDSHIPS

20:32.430 --> 20:34.159
WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE
YOUR OWN AGE.

20:34.190 --> 20:36.579
AND I KNOW THAT YOU AND MICAH
WERE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS,

20:36.610 --> 20:39.329
AND SOMETHING HAPPENED.
DID HE DO SOMETHING?

20:39.370 --> 20:42.999
DID YOU MAYBE SAY SOMETHING
THAT UPSET HIM?

20:43.030 --> 20:45.749
CAN YOU REMEMBER?

20:45.790 --> 20:47.610
- MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
HE WAS SUDDENLY OBSESSED

20:47.660 --> 20:48.968
WITH BASKETBALL, AND I TOLD HIM
BASKETBALL IS STUPID.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.060
- OKAY, THAT COULD BE.

20:52.110 --> 20:56.479
- HE CAN'T EVEN PLAY BASKETBALL.
HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR.

20:56.530 --> 20:58.009
- YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT, DID YOU?
- YEAH.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.497
AND THEN IT WAS
EVEN MORE STUPID,

21:00.530 --> 21:02.213
BECAUSE HE SAID HE COULD PLAY
WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL,

21:02.260 --> 21:03.420
WHICH I TOLD HIM WAS STUPID

21:03.460 --> 21:04.802
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
REAL BASKETBALL.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.774
- OKAY.

21:08.680 --> 21:12.844
I THINK THAT MAY HAVE HURT
MICAH'S FEELINGS.

21:12.890 --> 21:16.121
SO I THINK
YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO HIM.

21:16.170 --> 21:17.717
AND I GOT AN IDEA--

21:17.750 --> 21:18.887
WHY DON'T I GET SOME TICKETS
TO A GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS GAME,

21:18.930 --> 21:22.138
AND YOU CAN INVITE HIM TO GO
WITH US--WHAT DO YOU SAY?

21:22.170 --> 21:24.138
- I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS.

21:24.170 --> 21:26.206
- MAX, THIS IS IMPORTANT.
- THEY'RE NOT EVEN WARRIORS,

21:26.250 --> 21:27.649
ANYWAY,
THEY'RE BASKETBALL PLAYERS.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.133
WARRIORS FIGHT IN WARS...
- IT'S JUST THE NAME...

21:29.180 --> 21:30.579
OF THE TEAM, MAX--OKAY.
- THESE GUYS

21:30.630 --> 21:33.007
JUST PLAY BASKETBALL.
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

21:33.050 --> 21:35.939
- FOR MICAH AND FOR ME,
I WANT YOU TELL HIM YOU'RE SORRY

21:35.980 --> 21:36.833
FOR SAYING THOSE THINGS
AND INVITE HIM TO COME

21:36.880 --> 21:39.872
TO THE BASKETBALL GAME--
CAN YOU DO THAT?

21:43.850 --> 21:45.909
- FINE.

21:45.950 --> 21:48.259
- GREAT.

21:48.300 --> 21:51.098
I THINK THAT MICAH'S
GONNA BE VERY EXCITED

21:51.130 --> 21:54.645
ABOUT GOING
TO THIS BASKETBALL GAME.

21:54.690 --> 21:57.727
THAT'S GOOD.
I LIKE THAT.

22:03.940 --> 22:05.339
- ALL RIGHT, LITTLE DUDE,
PAY CLOSE ATTENTION

22:05.390 --> 22:07.904
TO THE MUSIC RIGHT HERE.
THIS PART IS PURE GENIUS.

22:07.940 --> 22:09.350
[Jawstheme playing]
- IS THAT THE SHARK?

22:09.390 --> 22:11.449
- NO, NO, NO,
SHE THINKS THE SHARK'S THERE.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.979
IT'S THE MUSIC, MAN.
IT'S SCARING YOU.

22:13.020 --> 22:14.089
IT'S MAKING EVERYTHING HURT.

22:14.120 --> 22:15.530
YOU'RE, LIKE, "I'M GONNA DIE!
I'M GONNA DIE!"

22:15.570 --> 22:17.117
- IS THE SHARK GONNA KILL
THAT GUY?

22:17.160 --> 22:18.559
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

22:18.610 --> 22:20.123
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF BED?
AND WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?

22:20.160 --> 22:20.979
WHAT IS THIS?
- JAWS.IT'S JAWS.

22:21.020 --> 22:22.817
- JAW--
TV OFF, YOU IN BED.

22:22.850 --> 22:24.579
GET UP, AND LET'S GO.
- I COULDN'T GO TO SLEEP!

22:24.610 --> 22:26.237
- WELL, YOU BETTER TRY NOW.
LET'S GO.

22:26.270 --> 22:27.339
- BUT HE SAID IT'S A CLASSIC.
- I DON'T CARE WHAT HE SAID.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.506
HE'S NOT YOUR MOTHER.
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

22:28.550 --> 22:31.235
- AND, YOU, HE'S TEN YEARS OLD.
YOU DON'T SHOW HIM--

22:31.280 --> 22:32.998
- IT'S NOT SCARY!
- OH.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.349
YOU CAN'T SHOW THE KID
THE HORROR MOVIES.

22:35.380 --> 22:36.551
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAN?
- HORROR MOVIES?

22:36.590 --> 22:37.625
JAWSIS A HORROR MOVIE?
- YES, IT'S A SCARY--

22:37.660 --> 22:39.628
IT'S A SCARY MOVIE, DUDE.
- LAST TIME I CHECKED,

22:39.660 --> 22:40.831
IT WAS BRILLIANT CINEMA.

22:40.870 --> 22:41.689
JUST THE SCORE
THAT'S FREAKING YOU OUT.

22:41.730 --> 22:43.595
- IT'S A GREAT MOVIE, BUT--
OH, BOY.

22:43.630 --> 22:47.418
YOU'RE IN THIS PART.
[mOVIe mu5Ic and dialogue]

22:47.460 --> 22:48.870
OH, HEY--
- I SAID TURN IT OFF.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.730
- TURN IT OFF ALREADY!
- OH, NO! OKAY!

22:50.780 --> 22:52.293
- HOW MANY TIMES
IS SHE GONNA ASK?

22:52.330 --> 22:54.469
[knock at door]

22:54.510 --> 22:55.397
- I GOT THE JOB.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.579
- YOU GOT THE JOB.
- YEAH.

22:57.610 --> 22:58.224
- CONGRATS. THAT'S AMAZING.
- THANKS.

22:58.270 --> 23:00.613
IT'S A LITTLE TOO AMAZING.

23:00.650 --> 23:01.992
- HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

23:02.030 --> 23:03.782
- UH, DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS?

23:03.830 --> 23:05.331
ARE YOU THE REASON I GOT IT?

23:05.380 --> 23:05.994
- I'M DEFINITELY NOT
THE REASON YOU GOT IT,

23:06.030 --> 23:07.440
BUT I DON'T THINK IT HURT.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.516
I MEAN, ALEC'S A FRIEND.
THIS IS GREAT.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.176
- I WAS UP AGAINST SOME REALLY
AMAZING PHOTOGRAPHERS.

23:12.210 --> 23:13.142
[sighs]
- EVEN BETTER.

23:13.180 --> 23:15.239
- IT JUST FEELS LIKE
I DON'T DESERVE IT.

23:15.290 --> 23:18.316
- HEY, DON'T--NO, DON'T TALK
ABOUT DESERVING IT, RIGHT?

23:18.360 --> 23:20.669
YOU WENT IN, YOU WON THE JOB.
NOW YOU'RE GONNA GO KILL IT.

23:20.700 --> 23:21.906
- WHAT IF I DON'T DO
A GOOD JOB?

23:21.950 --> 23:22.837
- WELL, THEN YOU'LL NEVER
WORK AGAIN,

23:22.880 --> 23:25.019
AND IT'LL LOOK BAD FOR ME.
- [chuckles]

23:25.050 --> 23:28.122
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T SECOND-GUESS THIS.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.128
YOU CAN DO IT.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.599
- I THINK GO TO THE RIGHT,
AND I THINK THERE'S--

23:33.650 --> 23:35.686
- HEY, COME ON,
WE GOT TO GO TO SCHOOL.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.063
WHERE'D YOU GET CHIPS?
- PANTRY, DUDE.

23:38.100 --> 23:39.647
- HEY, LISTEN TO ME.
GO BRUSH YOUR TEETH.

23:39.690 --> 23:41.032
- NO, NO, NO--
WE GOT TO GET TO A SAVE.

23:41.070 --> 23:42.037
WE GOT TO GET TO A SAVE.

23:42.070 --> 23:42.889
- OLIVER.
- OH, GOOD.

23:42.930 --> 23:44.374
- WHAT THE HELL?
- GREAT. OKAY.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.489
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, JABBAR?
- HEY, UNCLE ADAM.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.896
- CAN YOU PLEASE TURN THAT OFF?
- NO, JUST LET ME

23:46.940 --> 23:47.895
GET TO THE END
OF THIS LEVEL HERE.

23:47.940 --> 23:49.760
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO MORE VIDEO GAMES.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.381
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! OH!
- THE SLUMBER PARTY'S OVER.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.317
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO GET BACK IN THE STUDIO

23:52.360 --> 23:53.930
AND FINISH THE ALBUM.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

23:53.980 --> 23:55.459
- [sighs] WHAT IS THIS,
LIKE AN INTERVENTION HERE?

23:55.500 --> 23:56.660
- YEAH.
- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT,

23:56.710 --> 23:57.847
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO GET
IN THE STUDIO

23:57.880 --> 23:59.324
AND FINISH THAT SONG TODAY.

23:59.360 --> 24:01.157
- IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, MAN.
- YES, IT IS. IT HAS TO.

24:01.190 --> 24:03.363
- NO, LOOK, I'M WORKING WITH
A BUNCH OF DOUCHES OVER THERE.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.571
I'M NOT GONNA FINISH
THIS RECORD.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.089
- I DON'T CARE, MAN!

24:06.130 --> 24:07.711
YOU'RE THE FRONT MAN
OF THE BAND! UN-DOUCHE 'EM!

24:07.750 --> 24:09.229
WE'VE PUT IN TIME.
WE PUT IN MONEY.

24:09.270 --> 24:10.544
WE'VE PUT AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT
OF FAITH INTO ASHES OF ROME...

24:10.580 --> 24:12.616
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- AND WE BOTH NEED YOU

24:12.650 --> 24:14.584
TO BE AN ADULT,
GET BACK INTO THE LUNCHEONETTE,

24:14.620 --> 24:16.827
RECORD THAT ALBUM.
- YOU CAN'T FORCE CREATIVITY!

24:16.860 --> 24:18.748
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED
TO MAKE SOMETHING FROM NOTHING?

24:18.800 --> 24:20.199
HAVE YOU?
- LISTEN TO ME.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.275
YOU ARE CONTRACT UALLY OBLIGATED
TO FINISH THE ALBUM.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.935
- "CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED."
- YES, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU ARE.

24:23.970 --> 24:24.789
- YOU'RE PUTTING OUT
THE BIG-KID WORDS, AREN'T YOU?

24:24.840 --> 24:26.626
- SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FORCE IT.

24:26.670 --> 24:27.932
- YOU'RE GONNA CONTRACT UALLY--
- BYE, GUYS.

24:27.980 --> 24:29.004
- HAVE A GOOD DAY
AT SCHOOL, JABBAR.

24:29.050 --> 24:30.665
- I'M DRIVING YOU.
- BYE, OLIVER.

24:30.710 --> 24:32.325
- LATER, DUDE.
- BYE, SWEETIE.

24:32.360 --> 24:34.464
- I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT YOU
CAN'T STAY HERE ANY LONGER

24:34.500 --> 24:35.910
UNLESS YOU GET TO THE STUDIO.

24:35.950 --> 24:37.838
- OH, JUST ON YOUR WAY OUT,
YOU'RE GONNA DROP THAT.

24:37.890 --> 24:39.084
MRS. CROSBY,
YOU'RE GONNA LET HIM--

24:39.130 --> 24:40.677
- I'M NOT A PART OF THIS.
- BYE, OLIVER!

24:40.720 --> 24:42.574
- LOOK, WE WILL SEE YOU
IN THE STUDIO TODAY, OKAY?

24:42.610 --> 24:44.362
- THAT'S RIGHT. YOU GOT TO TEAR
THE BAND-AID OFF.

24:44.410 --> 24:47.265
- SURE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

24:54.520 --> 24:58.069
- MICAH. MICAH.

24:58.110 --> 25:00.044
MICAH.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.448
- [sighs]
WHAT'S UP, MAX?

25:03.500 --> 25:04.319
- I KNOW YOU LIKE BASKETBALL,

25:04.360 --> 25:06.464
AND I'M SORRY
I CALLED IT STUPID.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.876
- [scoffs]
- MY DAD AND I ARE GOING

25:07.920 --> 25:10.184
TO A GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS GAME
THIS FRIDAY,

25:10.230 --> 25:11.845
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WANTED TO COME.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.884
THE SEATS ARE SECTION 115,
ROW "G," SEATS 4 THROUGH 6.

25:15.920 --> 25:17.547
ALSO,
THERE WILL BE HOT DOGS.

25:17.580 --> 25:19.719
- [sighs]
I CAN'T.

25:19.750 --> 25:21.377
- IT'S ON FRIDAY,
AND THEY'LL BE PLAYING

25:21.410 --> 25:24.516
THE SAN ANTONIO SPURS,
AND THERE WILL BE NACHOS TOO.

25:24.550 --> 25:26.438
- OOH, NACHOS.
[laughs]

25:26.490 --> 25:29.277
[laughter]

25:29.320 --> 25:31.629
- I DON'T WANT TO GO.
SORRY.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.868
IS THAT IT?
BECAUSE WE'RE KIND OF BUSY.

25:36.530 --> 25:39.704
[background chatter]

25:45.500 --> 25:47.889
- UP AND DOWN.
THIS IS THE HAT.

25:47.920 --> 25:51.401
HEY, BUDDY.
MAX. WHAT--

25:51.440 --> 25:52.714
WHAT HAPPENED?

25:52.750 --> 25:54.160
- I DON'T KNOW.
HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.644
I DIDN'T GET A WORD OUT OF HIM
ALL THE WAY HOME.

25:55.690 --> 25:56.896
- HEY, BUD, WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:56.930 --> 25:58.852
- I'M GOING TO HANK'S.
- NO, NO, NO.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.822
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HANK'S.
IT'S NOT YOUR DAY, IS IT?

26:00.860 --> 26:01.997
- HANK DOESN'T CARE.
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

26:02.040 --> 26:04.508
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK.
I JUST WANT TO GO TO HANK'S.

26:04.560 --> 26:05.936
- ALL RIGHT, STOP.
MAX, LISTEN TO ME, OKAY?

26:05.970 --> 26:08.484
YOU CAN GO IF YOU JUST
LET US KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

26:08.530 --> 26:09.622
TALK TO YOUR MOTHER.
- YEAH.

26:09.670 --> 26:10.659
- WE'RE NOT GOING TO
THE BASKETBALL GAME ON FRIDAY,

26:10.700 --> 26:13.419
BECAUSE I ASKED MICAH TO GO
AND HE SAID NO.

26:13.460 --> 26:14.802
- WELL, WHY DID HE SAY NO?

26:14.840 --> 26:16.535
- DID YOU ASK HIM THE WAY
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT?

26:16.570 --> 26:17.639
- YES.
- AND YOU APOLOGIZED TO HIM?

26:17.670 --> 26:19.774
- YES.
- TOLD HIM ABOUT THE GOOD SEATS?

26:19.810 --> 26:21.778
- I TOLD HIM THE GREAT SEATS.
I TOLD HIM THE NACHOS.

26:21.820 --> 26:23.606
I TOLD HIM HOT DOGS.
I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.333
AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE
FRIENDS WITH ME ANYMORE,

26:25.370 --> 26:26.928
BECAUSE HE HAS NEW FRIENDS
THAT PLAY BASKETBALL,

26:26.960 --> 26:28.712
AND THEY ALL THINK
THAT I'M WEIRD.

26:28.750 --> 26:32.618
NOW, I TALKED.
I'M GOING TO HANK'S.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.659
- [sighs]

26:37.690 --> 26:41.649
- [tuning guitar]
[knock at door]

26:41.700 --> 26:44.168
- HEY.
- HI.

26:44.220 --> 26:46.620
CAN I COME IN?
- [chuckles] PLEASE.

26:49.780 --> 26:53.398
- WELL, MY GOSH.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.534
- WHAT?
- WELL, I'VE JUST NEVER

26:57.580 --> 26:59.366
BEEN HERE BEFORE.
THIS IS IT, HUH?

26:59.410 --> 27:02.026
- [chuckles] YEAH, THIS IS IT.
THIS IS ALL I'VE GOT.

27:02.060 --> 27:03.709
- CAN I SIT DOWN?
- PLEASE, YEAH.

27:03.760 --> 27:08.379
YOU WANT SOME WATER OR ANYTHING?
- NO. THANK YOU.

27:08.410 --> 27:10.344
- OKAY.

27:10.380 --> 27:14.487
- UH, I STOPPED BY
AND I SAW RYAN YESTERDAY.

27:14.520 --> 27:17.034
- OKAY.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.900
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT RYAN AT ALL,

27:18.940 --> 27:21.522
SO, PLEASE...
- YEAH.

27:21.570 --> 27:24.118
HE'S--HE'S PRETTY,
UH, TORN UP.

27:24.150 --> 27:28.018
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.
DO YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS TORN UP?

27:28.060 --> 27:30.631
ME.
'CAUSE I GOT BROKEN UP WITH.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.602
[sighs]
- I KNOW...

27:32.650 --> 27:37.269
THAT IF YOU LET THIS KID GO
AND YOU DON'T SAY GOOD-BYE,

27:37.310 --> 27:41.098
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

27:41.140 --> 27:43.825
- YOU REALIZE THAT I DIDN'T
ASK HIM TO LEAVE, RIGHT?

27:43.860 --> 27:45.862
YOU REALIZE HE BROKE OFF
OUR ENGAGEMENT.

27:45.900 --> 27:49.313
HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM,
AND THEN HE TOOK IT BACK.

27:49.350 --> 27:50.931
HE LEI-T ME.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.279
- BUT HE DESERVES A GOOD-BYE.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.799
- WHAT ABOUT WHAT I DESERVE?

27:54.840 --> 27:55.829
WHAT ABOUT WHAT
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER DESERVES

27:55.880 --> 28:00.226
AFTER I DID EXACTLY
WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO DO,

28:00.260 --> 28:03.809
WHICH WAS TO BE PATIENT
AND KIND AND LOVING AND OPEN

28:03.850 --> 28:06.159
AND TRY TO STAND BY HIM
THROUGH EVERYTHING?

28:06.200 --> 28:07.679
AND I DID THAT.
AND I KNOW YOU HAVE

28:07.720 --> 28:08.539
A WEIRD MILITARY THING
WITH HIM,

28:08.580 --> 28:11.993
BUT WHAT ABOUT ME?
- AMBER. AMBER.

28:12.030 --> 28:13.884
HERE, GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

28:16.380 --> 28:18.996
SWEETHEART, DO YOU LOVE HIM?

28:19.040 --> 28:22.248
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULD
ASK ME A QUESTION LIKE THAT.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.724
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY,

28:23.770 --> 28:24.623
BUT I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS WITH YOU.

28:24.660 --> 28:29.552
IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.068
IT'S JUST NOT.

28:34.190 --> 28:37.114
- OKAY.

28:46.790 --> 28:49.953
- AND I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO GO
TO THE BASKETBALL GAME ANYWAYS.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.581
IT'S A DUMB SPORT.

28:51.620 --> 28:53.099
- YEAH, I AGREE.
IT'S BORING.

28:53.140 --> 28:55.517
AND THEN THE LAST THREE MINUTES
TAKE, LIKE, AN HOUR.

28:55.560 --> 28:56.891
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

28:56.940 --> 28:58.828
- AND I ALSO DON'T SEE WHY
IT WAS BAD TO SAY

28:58.870 --> 29:00.656
HE CAN'T PLAY BASKETBALL
BECAUSE HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR.

29:00.700 --> 29:01.860
IT'S A FACT.
[phone ringing]

29:01.910 --> 29:03.491
- YEAH, HOLD ON,
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

29:03.530 --> 29:04.622
HELLO.

29:04.670 --> 29:07.252
UH-HUH.

29:07.290 --> 29:10.987
UH, YEAH, OKAY.
YEAH. NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

29:11.020 --> 29:12.749
ALL RIGHT, THANK--
WELL, HOLD ON.

29:12.780 --> 29:14.919
DO YOU MIND
TELLING ME WHO DID GET IT?

29:14.960 --> 29:16.985
YEAH, YEAH,
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

29:17.030 --> 29:20.614
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

29:20.650 --> 29:25.201
OH, YOU'RE AUNT SARAH--
SHE'S SOMETHING.

29:25.240 --> 29:28.619
- I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TALK
ABOUT AUNT SARAH WHILE I'M HERE.

29:28.660 --> 29:30.514
- WHAT?
- IF YOU MENTION AUNT SARAH,

29:30.560 --> 29:31.788
THEN I HAVE TO EITHER
CHANGE THE SUBJECT OR LEAVE.

29:31.830 --> 29:34.310
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE WON'T CALL HER AUNT SARAH.

29:34.350 --> 29:35.726
HOW ABOUT THAT?
WE'LL JUST CALL HER, UM,

29:35.770 --> 29:39.115
"TH E COM PETITOR."

29:39.150 --> 29:42.734
ANYWAY, THE COMPETITOR--
SHE STOLE A JOB FROM ME,

29:42.780 --> 29:45.044
EVEN THOUGH
SHE'S FAR LESS QUALIFIED.

29:45.090 --> 29:47.490
- THEN HOW'D SHE GET THE JOB?

29:47.540 --> 29:50.191
- SHE'S VERY, UM, CHARMING.

29:50.230 --> 29:52.437
THAT'S NOT REALLY THE WORD
I WANT TO USE.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.266
EVERYBODY LIKES HER.

29:54.300 --> 29:56.882
[bluesy music plays
in background]

29:56.930 --> 29:59.751
- I LIKE YOU
BETTER THAN AUNT SARAH.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.997
- WELL, YOU MIGHT BE
THE ONLY ONE.

30:02.040 --> 30:05.965
- EVERYONE ELSE SUCKS.
- PRETTY MUCH.

30:08.320 --> 30:11.426
- WHAT'S IT MEAN,
MRS. STARFISH?

30:11.460 --> 30:12.666
YOU'RE LONELY LIKE ME

30:12.700 --> 30:14.975
- OH, HELLO.

30:16.330 --> 30:17.729
I'M OUT BY THE END OF THE DAY.
I KNOW THE DRILL.

30:17.780 --> 30:20.567
I'M OUT.
DON'T WORRY.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.749
- DID YOU GO IN TODAY?

30:22.780 --> 30:25.647
- NOPE. NOPE.
[phone vibrating]

30:25.680 --> 30:28.569
OH, THERE'S THE MAN
RIGHT THERE.

30:28.610 --> 30:30.851
17 MISSED CROSBY CALLS.

30:30.890 --> 30:34.610
THIS MAN IS DEDICATED.

30:34.660 --> 30:38.892
- DID CROSBY EVER TELL YOU THAT
I WAS A PROFESSIONAL DANCER?

30:38.940 --> 30:40.384
- REALLY?
- YES.

30:40.420 --> 30:43.833
- THAT'S HOT. ARE WE TALKING,
LIKE, JAZZERCISE PANTS,

30:43.870 --> 30:47.112
OR ARE WE TALKING,
LIKE, EXOTIC KIND OF VIBE?

30:47.150 --> 30:48.879
- NONE OF THE ABOVE.

30:48.910 --> 30:52.459
YOU KNOW, I STARTED DANCING
WHEN I WAS SIX,

30:52.500 --> 30:55.708
AND I WANTED TO BE A DANCER
WHEN I GREW UP,

30:55.750 --> 31:00.084
BUT AS I GOT OLDER,
I REALIZED THAT THERE WERE...

31:01.130 --> 31:03.121
THERE WERE A LOT OF GIRLS
WITH THE SAME DREAM,

31:03.170 --> 31:06.924
AND I WONDERED, LIKE,
WHY WAS I GONNA MAKE IT?

31:06.960 --> 31:09.440
- I TOTALLY GET THAT.
- YOU KNOW?

31:09.480 --> 31:11.892
BUT I WENT FOR IT ANYWAY,
BECAUSE I KNEW IF I DIDN'T

31:11.930 --> 31:13.864
THAT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

31:13.900 --> 31:18.485
I WOULD WONDER
IF I COULD'VE MADE IT.

31:18.530 --> 31:22.079
I JUST HAD TO KNOW.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.213
YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE

31:24.260 --> 31:26.979
WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK
TO THE STUDIO?

31:27.020 --> 31:29.773
BECAUSE ONCE YOU'RE DONE,
IT'S OVER.

31:29.810 --> 31:34.338
THE ALBUM'S GONNA BE OUT THERE,
PEOPLE ARE GONNA JUDGE IT,

31:34.370 --> 31:36.292
AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

31:36.340 --> 31:39.093
- OH, I KNOW.
I'M NOT AFRAID OF SUCKING.

31:39.130 --> 31:41.337
THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
I'M NOT AFRAID OF THAT.

31:41.380 --> 31:44.895
WHAT I AM AFRAID OF
IS JUST BEING MEDIOCRE.

31:44.930 --> 31:45.851
I JUST...

31:45.900 --> 31:48.789
I JUST WANT IT TO BE GREAT.

31:48.830 --> 31:50.764
YOU KNOW?
- MM-HMM.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.348
- THAT GREAT THAT YOU DREAMED
WHEN YOU WERE A KID, YOU KNOW?

31:53.390 --> 31:54.288
- MM-HMM.
- LIKE, THE REAL DEAL.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.493
THIS IS ALL I'VE EVER KNOWN
HOW TO DO.

31:56.530 --> 31:59.146
THIS--I LITERALLY HAVE
NO OTHER SKILLS.

31:59.190 --> 32:00.805
- [laughs]
- IT'S NOT FUNNY. I'M SERIOUS.

32:00.840 --> 32:03.604
- NO, I AGREE WITH YOU.

32:03.640 --> 32:07.360
LOOK, OLIVER,
YOU GOT TO GET IT OUT THERE.

32:07.400 --> 32:11.404
OTHERWISE,
YOU'LL ALWAYS WONDER.

32:13.510 --> 32:16.445
- [sighs]

32:21.420 --> 32:24.969
- OH, GOLLY.
SHE'S FINALLY DOWN.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.341
- GOOD.

32:26.390 --> 32:29.382
- SHE WAS FEISTY TODAY,
LIKE HER DADDY.

32:29.430 --> 32:31.386
[both chuckle]

32:31.430 --> 32:33.455
WHAT YOU DOING?

32:36.540 --> 32:40.567
- I WAS THINKING ABOUT CALLING
MICAH'S PARENTS AND BEGGING THEM

32:40.610 --> 32:44.956
TO HAVE HIM GO TO THIS
WARRIORS GAME WITH MAX.

32:47.030 --> 32:49.260
- WELL, YOU KNOW ME--
I'M NOT ABOVE BEGGING,

32:49.310 --> 32:51.619
ESPECIALLY
WHEN IT COMES TO MAX, BUT--

32:51.650 --> 32:52.992
- I JUST DON'T KNOW
THAT IT'S GONNA HELP

32:53.040 --> 32:55.725
WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON HERE.

32:55.760 --> 32:59.070
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS REALLY GOING ON HERE?

32:59.110 --> 33:02.341
- MAX HAS LOST HIS ONLY FRIEND
AT SCHOOL.

33:03.980 --> 33:05.208
THE KIDS AT SCHOOL
ARE STARTING TO NOTICE

33:05.250 --> 33:09.425
THAT MAX HAS HIS...
DIFFERENCES.

33:10.850 --> 33:14.399
AND HE'S ALL ALONE.

33:15.710 --> 33:18.952
- HONEY, LOOK, I MEAN,
I WANT TO FIX THINGS FOR MAX

33:18.990 --> 33:21.618
ALL THE TIME--
YOU KNOW THAT I DO.

33:21.650 --> 33:25.928
BUT HE'S GETTING OLDER,
AND WE CAN'T JUST JUMP IN

33:25.960 --> 33:27.894
AND SOLVE HIS PROBLEMS
ALL THE TIME.

33:27.930 --> 33:31.206
- HE WAS HUMILIATED,
KRISTINA.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.899
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM
WHEN HE WAS WALKING

33:34.940 --> 33:35.759
BACK TO THE CAR
FROM THOSE KIDS.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.837
I'M HELPLESS.

33:38.870 --> 33:40.758
AND I HATE IT.

33:43.220 --> 33:45.734
I JUST HATE IT.

33:54.860 --> 33:57.124
- HEY.
- HEY.

33:57.170 --> 34:00.856
- IS THIS YOURS?

34:00.900 --> 34:02.618
- YEAH.

34:07.490 --> 34:10.869
- [sighs]

34:10.910 --> 34:14.186
I'M SO MAD AT YOU.

34:14.220 --> 34:17.041
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

34:17.080 --> 34:19.594
WHY YOU WOULD DO THIS.

34:19.640 --> 34:21.915
I DON'T--

34:21.950 --> 34:24.817
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

34:24.850 --> 34:27.364
WHY YOU WOULD LEAVE ME.

34:27.410 --> 34:30.368
I DON'T THINK
I EVER REALLY WILL.

34:30.410 --> 34:32.685
I THINK WHAT MAKES ME
THE ANGRIEST

34:32.720 --> 34:36.781
IS THAT YOU WOULD GO SOMEWHERE
THAT I CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE

34:36.830 --> 34:39.685
THAT YOU'RE SAFE.

34:39.730 --> 34:42.961
SO JUST, PLEASE...

34:43.010 --> 34:46.411
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, OKAY?

34:46.460 --> 34:47.939
- YEAH.
- AND PROMISE ME

34:47.980 --> 34:49.663
THAT YOU'LL COME
HOME SAFE, OKAY?

34:49.700 --> 34:52.908
PROMISE.

34:52.950 --> 34:56.113
- I'LL BE CAREFUL.

34:56.160 --> 34:59.744
- OKAY.

34:59.780 --> 35:03.125
WELL, THAT'S...

35:03.170 --> 35:05.547
THAT'S ALL
I CAME HERE TO SAY.

35:33.160 --> 35:35.333
- HI.

35:35.370 --> 35:37.099
- OH, LOOK AT THIS.

35:37.130 --> 35:39.269
SARAH LEIBOVITZ
IS IN THE BUILDING.

35:39.300 --> 35:41.052
- NICE. VERY GOOD.
SO YOU HEARD?

35:41.100 --> 35:42.613
- I DID HEAR, YEAH.
- WOW.

35:42.650 --> 35:45.892
LISTEN, I HAVE A QUESTION
RELATED TO MY NEW JOB,

35:45.930 --> 35:47.443
BUT I WOULD LIKE
YOUR ASSURANCE

35:47.490 --> 35:50.869
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA EMBARRASS
ME OR MAKE ME GROVEL.

35:50.900 --> 35:53.414
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THAT.

35:53.460 --> 35:54.381
- OKAY, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, WHAT?

35:54.420 --> 35:56.797
I WON'T MAKE YOU--
I WON'T EMBARRASS YOU

35:56.840 --> 35:57.590
OR THE OTHER THING.

35:57.630 --> 35:59.143
- GROVEL.
DO NOT MAKE ME GROVEL.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.146
- ALL RIGHT, I WON'T. GO.
- OKAY.

36:01.190 --> 36:03.977
UM, SO I HAVE THIS JOB
FOR SURFSPORT,

36:04.020 --> 36:05.669
AND I'VE REALIZED

36:05.710 --> 36:07.746
THAT I'M A LITTLE SHORT
ON CERTAIN EQUIPMENT,

36:07.780 --> 36:11.295
AND I NEED STUDIO SPACE
THAT I DON'T HAVE.

36:11.340 --> 36:13.740
AND SO I WONDERED IF I COULD--

36:13.790 --> 36:16.759
IF WE COULD, YOU KNOW,
DO THE JOB TOGETHER.

36:16.790 --> 36:20.237
- JUST LIKE WE USED TO?
- EXCEPT THAT I'M THE BOSS.

36:20.280 --> 36:23.556
- [chuckles]
I DON'T THINK SO.

36:23.590 --> 36:24.727
- OKAY. I JUST--

36:24.760 --> 36:28.275
- UM, I MEAN, LOOK,
FORGET WHO'S WHAT.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.799
HOW DOES THAT WORK MONEY-WISE?

36:29.840 --> 36:32.809
- RIGHT TO THE DEAL MAKING.
- YEAH, I MEAN, HOW WE GONNA--

36:32.840 --> 36:33.522
- I'D PAY YOU, OF COURSE.

36:33.570 --> 36:35.834
- PAY ME WHAT?
- YOUR FEE.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.108
- MY HOURLY FEE?
- YES.

36:37.160 --> 36:40.049
- YOU--YOU WOULD GO BROKE.
- NO, NO, NOT THAT HOURLY FEE.

36:40.090 --> 36:43.196
THE HOURLY FEE THAT YOU GET
AFTER, YOU KNOW, WE--

36:43.230 --> 36:44.390
- I DON'T HAVE THAT.
- Al-TER THE--A|-TER--

36:44.440 --> 36:45.771
- SEE DO WHAT I DO, OKAY?
THERE'S--

36:45.820 --> 36:47.162
YOU CAN'T AFFORD THAT.
- OH, MY GOD. OKAY, FINE,

36:47.200 --> 36:49.543
THEN WE'LL SPLIT IT 70/30.
- 50/50.

36:49.580 --> 36:50.308
- 50/50?
- WE'RE USING MY EQUIPMENT.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.786
WE'RE DOING MY THING.
COME ON.

36:52.830 --> 36:54.377
- YOU TOLD ME
YOU WOULD NOT MAKE ME GROVEL.

36:54.410 --> 36:55.786
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.
- I DIDN'T KNOW

36:55.830 --> 36:59.243
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT MONEY.
- [SlghS]

36:59.280 --> 37:01.794
OKAY.

37:03.600 --> 37:04.692
- ALL RIGHT, BUT HOLD ON.
BUT FIRST, I JUST WANT--

37:04.730 --> 37:06.869
- OH, MY GOD, WHAT ELSE?
- NO, I JUST WANT ONE THING.

37:06.910 --> 37:08.218
I JUST WANT YOU TO SAY

37:08.260 --> 37:09.147
IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT
THE EQUIPMENT OR THE TIME

37:09.190 --> 37:13.980
OR THE THING OR--
IT'S ABOUT THE TALENT

37:14.020 --> 37:18.081
AND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE IN
A LITTLE BIT OVER YOUR HEAD.

37:18.130 --> 37:20.917
SAY IT, BOSS.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.882
- ALL RIGHT, BUDDY, ARE YOU
SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THIS GAME?

37:22.930 --> 37:25.194
- THIS IS STUPID.
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.719
- IT'S NOT STUPID,
AND YOUR DAD'S

37:26.760 --> 37:28.899
TOTALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SO MUCH FUN!

37:28.930 --> 37:29.965
- OKAY! WHO...
- YAY!

37:30.000 --> 37:31.820
- IS READY TO RUMBLE?

37:31.870 --> 37:33.417
- I'M READY TO RUMBLE.
- HUH? THERE YOU GO.

37:33.450 --> 37:35.008
- OH, YOU JUST GAVE ME
THE FINGER.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.769
- I DID.
- THANK YOU. [laughS]

37:36.800 --> 37:38.108
- WHAT IS THIS?
- IT'S A FOAM FINGER

37:38.150 --> 37:40.141
FOR CHEERING.
[both cheering]

37:40.180 --> 37:41.624
- IT LOOKS STUPID.
- THAT'S THE POINT.

37:41.670 --> 37:44.457
both: WHOOP, WHOOP!
WHOOP, WHOOP!

37:44.500 --> 37:46.013
- ALL RIGHT, I HAVE ONE QUESTION
FOR YOU, MAX, BEFORE WE GO.

37:46.050 --> 37:48.018
ARE YOU READY TO RUMBLE?

37:48.050 --> 37:50.189
- YES. CAN YOU PLEASE
STOP ASKING THAT QUESTION?

37:50.230 --> 37:51.299
- NO. I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
- [laughs]

37:51.330 --> 37:53.298
- OH, I THINK I MUST HAVE
A LITTLE WAX IN MY EAR.

37:53.340 --> 37:54.409
- I'M READY TO RUMBLE.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.226
- ARE YOU READY TO RUMBLE?

37:56.270 --> 37:58.124
- YES!
I'M READY TO RUMBLE!

37:58.170 --> 37:59.478
- WHOO!

38:00.240 --> 38:01.138
- YES. YES.
- I'M EXCITED.

38:01.170 --> 38:03.445
- LET'S GO.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.300
OH.

38:05.350 --> 38:06.863
- YOU READY?
- I'M READY.

38:06.900 --> 38:07.969
- ALL RIGHT.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.763
- [laughs]
- OKAY, MAX.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.449
both: WHOO!

38:11.490 --> 38:14.618
- ALL RIGHTY.

38:14.670 --> 38:17.047
AND THAT IS ALL SHE WROTE.

38:17.080 --> 38:18.422
I'M OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

38:18.460 --> 38:20.325
- WELL, WE MADE IT.
- [laughs] YAY.

38:20.360 --> 38:21.941
- I JUST WANT TO SAY, LIKE,
LIVING WITH YOU GUYS

38:21.980 --> 38:26.849
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS HAS BEEN
LIFE-CHANGING, SERIOUSLY.

38:26.890 --> 38:28.710
AND, JASMINE,
IF I EVER GET MARRIED,

38:28.750 --> 38:30.957
AND I'M TALKING YEARS FROM NOW,
WAY DOWN THE ROAD...

38:30.990 --> 38:33.788
- MM-HMM.
- I WANT A CHICK THAT'S JUST,

38:33.820 --> 38:37.278
LIKE, A YOUNGER VERSION OF YOU.
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT--

38:37.310 --> 38:40.279
YOU KNOW, FINE WINE,
LIKE AGELESS BEAUTY--

38:40.310 --> 38:42.551
- YEAH, I GOT IT.
THANK YOU, OLIVER.

38:42.590 --> 38:43.204
- ANYWAY, I'M JUST TRYING
TO SAY THANK YOU,

38:43.250 --> 38:45.389
AND SO I WROTE YOU A SONG.

38:45.420 --> 38:46.387
- OH.
- REALLY?

38:46.420 --> 38:48.695
- IT'S CALLED
JASMINE ALL THE TIME.

38:48.740 --> 38:50.833
I'M SERIOUSLY NOT TRYING
TO MOVE IN ON YOUR WIFE HERE,

38:50.880 --> 38:52.689
BUT I CAN PLAY IT FOR YOU
IF YOU WANT. I MEAN--

38:52.740 --> 38:54.139
- NO, NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW.

38:54.190 --> 38:55.464
- YEAH!
- I WANT TO HEAR IT, YEAH.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.285
- YEAH? ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

38:56.330 --> 38:58.776
- IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.
HE'S GOOD.

38:58.810 --> 39:01.051
THIS COULD END UP ON THE ALBUM.
- ALL RIGHT.

39:01.090 --> 39:03.024
JASMINE ALL THE TIME.
IT'S JUST, LIKE, A PIECE.

39:03.060 --> 39:05.949
ALL RIGHT.

39:05.990 --> 39:09.300
JUST TH ROW AWAY
THE CLOCKS FOR NOW

39:09.340 --> 39:15.484
IT'S JASMINE
ALL THE TIME

39:15.520 --> 39:21.868
IT KEEPS JASMINE
ON MY MIND

39:21.910 --> 39:25.562
AND I'M PICKING UP
THE PIECES

39:25.600 --> 39:28.114
WITH EVERY SONG I WRITE

39:28.150 --> 39:31.984
IT'S JA-A-A

39:32.020 --> 39:33.430
JASMINE

39:33.470 --> 39:36.917
JASMINE ALL THE TIME
[song ends]

39:40.930 --> 39:43.854
- [sighs]

39:53.490 --> 39:56.072
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

39:57.630 --> 40:00.690
- YEAH, I KNOW.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.603
BUT IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

40:08.230 --> 40:09.538
- IS IT?

40:12.820 --> 40:16.711
- HEY, LOOK, IF I SAY
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,

40:16.750 --> 40:18.308
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, OKAY?

40:18.340 --> 40:20.376
OKAY.

40:20.410 --> 40:21.138
- [laughs]

40:21.170 --> 40:24.037
OKAY.

40:24.070 --> 40:26.868
OKAY.

40:26.900 --> 40:28.174
[mellow guitar]

40:28.210 --> 40:31.418
- I FEEL ITS PRESENCE

40:31.460 --> 40:33.075
STILL ENOUGH

40:36.460 --> 40:38.519
IT'S BEAUTIFUL

40:38.570 --> 40:41.391
BUT IT CHANGES

40:41.430 --> 40:42.988
IT'S BEAUTIFUL

40:52.030 --> 40:55.579
- HEY, JOEL, I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.373
I WAS THINKING
THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND SEE

40:58.420 --> 41:01.173
A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR.

41:01.210 --> 41:02.939
I CALLED AROUND TODAY,

41:02.970 --> 41:04.141
AND A COUPLE OF THEM
CAN TAKE US THIS WEEK.

41:04.180 --> 41:07.968
- NO.

41:08.010 --> 41:10.069
- NO, THIS WEEK
DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU, OR--

41:10.120 --> 41:13.009
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE
A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR

41:13.050 --> 41:15.985
BECAUSE THE MARRIAGE
IS NOT THE PROBLEM.

41:16.020 --> 41:17.089
THE PROBLEM IS YOU.

41:17.120 --> 41:20.396
- JOEL, I DON'T--

41:20.440 --> 41:21.816
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING--

41:21.850 --> 41:23.852
THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL YOU ABOUT ED.

41:23.890 --> 41:25.300
- YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ME
ABOUT ED--

41:25.340 --> 41:25.920
- BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING IT
A BIGGER DEAL THAN IT IS.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.929
- IT'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL.

41:28.960 --> 41:31.064
- OKAY.
- IT'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.032
IT'S NOT EVEN JUST ED.

41:32.070 --> 41:34.300
IT'S LIKE EVER SINCE
YOU LEI-T YOUR JOB,

41:34.350 --> 41:39.037
I DON'T EVEN KNOW--
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.524
- I WANT TO FIX IT.
- I'VE BEEN WANDERING

41:40.560 --> 41:41.834
AROUND THIS HOUSE
FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS

41:41.870 --> 41:45.829
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY I'M--
I'M HERE, WHY I'M DOING THIS,

41:45.880 --> 41:48.155
AND I JUST THINK
IT'S 'CAUSE OF THOSE TWO.

41:48.190 --> 41:50.158
IAM SO...

41:50.190 --> 41:54.672
- [crying] JOEL, DON'T YOU THINK
SOMEBODY CAN HELP US?

41:58.510 --> 42:00.887
- YOU WANT TO FIX IT,
AND I DON'T THINK--

42:00.930 --> 42:03.956
I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE FIXED.

42:07.490 --> 42:10.823
- [sobbing]
