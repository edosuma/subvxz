WEBVTT

00:02.922 --> 00:05.289
Okay, here comes Kelso.

00:05.353 --> 00:07.208
Oh, this is going to be so good.

00:07.273 --> 00:09.761
But plug your nose, because
it's also going to be foul.

00:12.489 --> 00:16.996
- All right, somebody put a stink bomb in my backpack!
- Oh!

00:17.066 --> 00:20.644
And when I find out who,
I'm gonna kick some ass!

00:20.713 --> 00:22.982
Why must people be cruel?

00:25.609 --> 00:29.537
Yeah, 'cause now I gotta
go see Jackie smelling like a skunk.

00:29.609 --> 00:34.344
And Jackie hates skunks,
except for PepÃ© le Pew.

00:34.409 --> 00:37.060
And, you gotta admit,
for a skunk, he's pretty romantic.

00:40.425 --> 00:43.273
Okay, guys, I've got
five stink bombs left.

00:43.338 --> 00:45.989
Let's go ruin
someone else's day.

00:46.058 --> 00:48.840
Sorry, guys.
I'm going to the movies with Donna.

00:48.905 --> 00:52.483
It's like we hardly see each other, now
that she got that job at the radio station.

00:52.553 --> 00:56.034
Yeah, you're the wife of
a famous radio personality.

00:56.105 --> 00:58.561
Go bake me a pie, Martha.

00:58.634 --> 01:01.416
Oh, my God.

01:01.482 --> 01:04.548
Donna's on the radio.
She's doing the farm report right now.

01:06.537 --> 01:08.392
And in pork belly news...

01:08.457 --> 01:11.010
prices have risen to nearly
54 cents per pound.

01:11.082 --> 01:14.246
Mmm-mmm, bacon!

01:14.314 --> 01:18.470
Pork belly prices.
How cute is that?

01:18.537 --> 01:21.669
<i>And I'll be back at 3:00, 4:00 and 5:00</i>
<i>with more updates.</i>

01:21.738 --> 01:24.072
Until then, keep on farmin'.

01:24.137 --> 01:27.486
Is that okay? I just added that.
I <i>did</i> hit the button.

01:27.561 --> 01:30.311
Oh!

01:30.378 --> 01:34.207
She's staying late again?
Oh, God.

01:34.281 --> 01:39.038
How much fast-breaking pork belly news
can there possibly be?

01:39.114 --> 01:41.318
That's it.
I'm goin' down there.

01:44.137 --> 01:47.137
- Well, that conversation's going to go badly.
- How do you know?

01:47.209 --> 01:50.176
I put a stink bomb in his back pocket.

01:53.674 --> 01:55.462
You're doin' the rest of the farm reports?
Come on.

01:55.530 --> 01:57.384
I thought we were goin'
to the movies.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.002
Well, Janice called in sick, so...

02:00.073 --> 02:02.790
Why do you smell like butt?

02:02.858 --> 02:06.338
That is none of your business, okay?

02:06.409 --> 02:08.776
Okay, Donna, look.
I think we need to talk.

02:08.841 --> 02:11.208
I think this job is really
cutting into your Eric time.

02:12.425 --> 02:14.280
My "Eric time"?

02:14.345 --> 02:18.087
And I'm very concerned
about your diminishing Eric time...

02:18.153 --> 02:20.575
because it directly affects me,
you know.

02:21.737 --> 02:24.487
I'm Eric.

02:24.553 --> 02:27.488
Hey, thanks for
staying late again, Donna.

02:27.561 --> 02:29.700
You know, you might just
turn this into a full-time gig.

02:29.769 --> 02:33.544
Hey, I'm her full-time gig.

02:33.609 --> 02:38.082
No offense.
You stink, dude.

02:38.153 --> 02:41.187
Here's those tickets.
Enjoy the show.

02:43.209 --> 02:46.024
- Tickets?
- I know I've been working a lot lately.

02:46.089 --> 02:47.944
I wanted to make it up to you,
so I got Max...

02:48.009 --> 02:50.213
to hook us up with Ted Nugent tickets
for everybody!

02:50.281 --> 02:54.023
The Motor City Madman?
No way!

02:54.089 --> 02:56.740
Oh, my disappointment is melting...

02:56.809 --> 03:00.257
into a mixture of
excitement and guilt.

03:00.329 --> 03:02.751
- Great. That's what I was going for.
- Oh!

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:39.741 --> 03:42.424
As soon as I saw that skunk,
I knew...

03:42.494 --> 03:45.308
<i>that I had to capture it</i>
<i>and return it to the zoo...</i>

03:45.374 --> 03:49.629
where it could maybe,
just maybe...

03:49.693 --> 03:51.482
fall in love like you and I.

03:51.549 --> 03:55.477
- Oh! Michael, that is so sweet.
- Yeah.

03:55.549 --> 03:58.331
That's me... sweet.

03:58.397 --> 04:01.594
So, here we are.

04:01.661 --> 04:07.127
What to do.
What to do.

04:07.197 --> 04:09.336
Oh, I know what we can do.
It.

04:09.405 --> 04:14.009
No, Michael,
I'm not doing "it" in a car.

04:14.078 --> 04:16.925
Now that we're back together,
I want it to be special.

04:16.988 --> 04:20.372
I want our second first time
to be magical.

04:20.446 --> 04:23.577
I can do magic.
Check it out.

04:23.645 --> 04:25.849
Hmm? Hmm?

04:29.277 --> 04:30.968
Michael, I'm serious.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.372
Jackie, I just removed a finger!

04:35.485 --> 04:38.682
All right, how about this?

04:38.749 --> 04:40.636
We'll have a special day...

04:40.701 --> 04:43.898
just dedicated to all the romantic magic
you want.

04:43.965 --> 04:47.707
That's a great idea.
But you know what would be even better?

04:47.773 --> 04:50.588
If we did it right now?

04:50.653 --> 04:53.436
No!
That instead of one day...

04:53.501 --> 04:55.356
we have a whole week
of romantic magic.

04:56.669 --> 04:59.386
Well, that would be seven times longer.

04:59.454 --> 05:01.396
And seven times better.

05:01.469 --> 05:05.244
And seven times longer.
Yea.

05:07.421 --> 05:09.690
You know,
our anniversary's comin' up.

05:09.758 --> 05:11.612
Eighteen years.

05:11.678 --> 05:14.165
I can still remember
the first time I saw Midgie.

05:14.237 --> 05:16.855
She was the tallest girl
in chemistry class.

05:16.925 --> 05:20.341
And Bob was the shortest boy.

05:20.413 --> 05:24.669
But what he lacked in height,
he made up for in shortness.

05:30.461 --> 05:33.593
Red, um, remember when we first met?

05:34.974 --> 05:37.013
Like it was yesterday.

05:39.869 --> 05:44.092
<i>It was 1952 at a U.S.O. dance.</i>

05:44.157 --> 05:47.059
<i>Me and my buddies</i>
<i>were blowin' off steam.</i>

05:52.733 --> 05:55.416
<i>And, suddenly, I saw her.</i>

05:58.525 --> 06:02.169
<i>She was the most</i>
<i>beautiful girl in the joint.</i>

06:04.605 --> 06:07.060
Hiya, dame.
Wanna shake a leg?

06:07.133 --> 06:09.621
No, thanks.

06:09.693 --> 06:12.660
- It wasn't a question.
- I think it was, mister.

06:12.733 --> 06:14.805
Mind if I cut in?

06:14.877 --> 06:16.699
It's none of your business,
bell-bottom.

06:16.765 --> 06:19.482
I think you could use
a little punch, leatherneck.

06:25.854 --> 06:28.636
Oh, you're in big trouble,
Red Forman.

06:28.701 --> 06:31.963
Huh?

06:32.029 --> 06:34.931
I said, you're in big trouble,
Red Forman.

06:35.005 --> 06:37.558
You're thinking of some other girl.

06:37.629 --> 06:39.516
That's not how we met at all.

06:40.989 --> 06:42.876
Oh.

06:42.941 --> 06:44.796
Oh!

06:47.549 --> 06:49.404
Uh-oh.

06:51.422 --> 06:53.276
Fez, what's in the box?

06:53.342 --> 06:55.708
Counterfeit concert T-shirts.

06:55.773 --> 06:57.627
Me and Hyde are going to
sell them after the show.

06:59.197 --> 07:01.052
Oh, how entrepreneurial of you.

07:01.117 --> 07:04.314
You see, I figure with the original
concert T's going for $15...

07:04.381 --> 07:07.993
we sell ours for 10,
I turn a $50 investment into 250 bucks.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.752
Where'd you get 50 bucks?
I thought you were broke.

07:09.821 --> 07:12.985
I sneaked it from
your Candy Land stash.

07:13.053 --> 07:15.474
So if you think about it,
it's all profit.

07:17.117 --> 07:19.735
Okay, fine.
Can I borrow $50?

07:21.437 --> 07:23.957
Hey, you wanna see what
50 stolen bucks can buy?

07:29.085 --> 07:30.940
Fez! It's "Ted" Nugent!

07:31.005 --> 07:33.460
Uh-huh.
Tad Nugent.

07:33.533 --> 07:36.216
No, man.
I'm saying "Ted."

07:36.285 --> 07:38.652
I'm saying Tad too.

07:38.717 --> 07:41.051
- No, you're not. It says "Tad."
- I know it says "Tad."

07:41.117 --> 07:43.157
I'm the one who put it on there.

07:43.229 --> 07:45.084
I don't know why we're fighting.
What's the problem here?

07:45.149 --> 07:47.516
Because the shirt says "Tad."

07:47.581 --> 07:49.556
Exactly.

07:49.629 --> 07:53.425
- But the "A" should be an "E."
- That's not how you spell "Tad."

07:53.501 --> 07:55.923
No.
That's how you spell "Ted."

07:57.629 --> 08:00.247
Oh.

08:00.317 --> 08:04.757
These shirts are useless.
Now Forman's out 50 bucks.

08:20.253 --> 08:25.042
You know, it's hard enough trying to
remember this without you two staring at me.

08:25.117 --> 08:27.506
Hey, I could hypnotize you.

08:27.581 --> 08:30.548
I know!
You could retrace your steps.

08:30.621 --> 08:32.508
What did you have for breakfast?

08:36.284 --> 08:38.804
Oh, hi, Kitty.
Uh, you know...

08:38.876 --> 08:42.423
I was just thinking
about how much I love you.

08:42.493 --> 08:47.282
- So, you remember yet?
- Yes! No.

08:48.893 --> 08:52.439
It was November 17, 1953
at a U.S.O. dance.

08:52.509 --> 08:57.179
I remember because it was the most
important moment of <i>my</i> life!

08:57.245 --> 09:00.278
Really, Kitty?

09:00.349 --> 09:03.927
Because in November 1953...

09:03.997 --> 09:06.779
I was in Korea.

09:06.845 --> 09:10.456
So I'm pretty sure that
you were talking to someone else.

09:12.765 --> 09:15.350
Are you sure?

09:15.421 --> 09:18.236
Maybe-Maybe you came home
for the weekend.

09:18.301 --> 09:21.717
Not from Korea.

09:21.788 --> 09:24.690
Oh, great. Now,
neither one of us knows how we met.

09:24.765 --> 09:29.621
Well, you better get
your thinking cap on, mister.

09:37.117 --> 09:40.019
<i>Thank you, Wisconsin! Good night!</i>

09:40.093 --> 09:44.184
- That was the coolest, most bitchin' concert!
- That was so cool!

09:44.253 --> 09:46.108
- Totally!
- That was cool.

09:46.173 --> 09:48.540
All right, let's go try and sell
these stupid T-shirts.

09:48.605 --> 09:51.900
God, Michael,
this was the most magical night.

09:51.965 --> 09:55.707
You know, during the concert, I rewrote some
of Ted Nugent's songs with your name in it.

09:55.773 --> 09:58.140
Okay, which one do you like better...

09:58.205 --> 10:03.835
"Cat Scratch Jackie"
or "Jackie Scratch Fever"?

10:03.901 --> 10:06.006
I love them both!

10:08.029 --> 10:09.971
- What do you wanna do now?
- Uh...

10:10.044 --> 10:13.656
Ooh! We can go around back and watch the
tour buses from behind the chain-link fence.

10:13.725 --> 10:17.206
- Great idea!
- Hiya, kids. Enjoy the show?

10:17.277 --> 10:20.822
Are you kidding?
I'm deaf!

10:22.172 --> 10:25.140
You can say that again, Max.

10:25.213 --> 10:28.213
Well, you know,
I'm startin' to come down.

10:28.284 --> 10:31.448
I mean, I'm getting tired.

10:31.516 --> 10:33.883
Uh, why don't you take this?

10:33.949 --> 10:36.982
Oh, my God.
A backstage pass.

10:37.053 --> 10:42.519
Oh, yeah!
Oh, too bad there's only one, huh?

10:42.589 --> 10:44.858
I'll be back in five minutes, I swear.

10:44.925 --> 10:48.241
- You're going?
- Well, don't you want me to?

10:48.317 --> 10:51.732
Of course I do.

10:51.805 --> 10:55.285
That's why I said,
"Oh, you're going! Yea!"

10:55.357 --> 10:56.950
You're the best!

10:59.933 --> 11:04.788
Yeah, that's... Yeah, that's good.
That's nice for her.

11:06.684 --> 11:09.237
You'll never see her again.

11:09.308 --> 11:12.342
That's how I lost my first wife.

11:12.413 --> 11:15.096
Damn you, Donny Osmond!

11:21.488 --> 11:23.976
T-shirts!

11:24.048 --> 11:26.830
Get your crappy, misspelled T-shirts!

11:26.896 --> 11:32.014
Can't enjoy the after-party without
your crappy, misspelled T-shirts!

11:33.456 --> 11:36.839
I rue the day I took you
under my wing, my foreign friend.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.985
I'm sorry you feel that way, Hyde...

11:39.056 --> 11:41.227
but I think that the time
we spended together...

11:41.296 --> 11:44.363
has taught us each
a little bit about tolerance...

11:44.433 --> 11:47.280
humanity, friendship.

11:47.344 --> 11:49.199
Whatever.

11:50.545 --> 11:52.399
Ew! Michael,
someone blew chunks.

11:56.848 --> 12:00.426
May I escort you
across the vomit, my lady?

12:00.496 --> 12:02.885
Why, thank you, good sir.

12:05.872 --> 12:09.003
I hate them.

12:09.072 --> 12:12.585
You just bought yourself
a barfy Todd Nugent T-shirt, mister!

12:14.288 --> 12:16.525
Fez.

12:16.592 --> 12:19.243
It's Ted!

12:27.312 --> 12:29.101
Hey, who ordered the redhead?

12:31.344 --> 12:33.384
Oh, my God.
You're looking at me.

12:33.456 --> 12:35.496
Ted Nugent is looking at me.

12:35.569 --> 12:38.471
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>Stop looking at me!</i>

12:38.544 --> 12:41.294
I'm Donna.
I am, like, your biggest fan.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.248
Hi, Donna.
Meet the other groupies.

12:43.312 --> 12:45.167
<i>This is Blonde Girl,</i>
<i>the Other Blonde Girl...</i>

12:45.232 --> 12:47.915
Tall Girl,
and the Tall Blonde Girl.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.839
Well, actually, I'm not a groupie.

12:49.904 --> 12:52.490
I mean, I love you,
but I work at a rock radio station.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.309
WFPP, "The Sound."
I do the farm report.

12:55.377 --> 12:58.443
It's, like, a huge day
for pork bellies.

12:58.513 --> 13:00.367
You don't care.
Sorry.

13:00.433 --> 13:03.978
You work for a radio station?
You wanna do an interview or somethin'?

13:04.048 --> 13:07.082
Oh, my God.
An interview would be amazing.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.487
Do you have, um,
a piece of paper, one of those, uh...

13:09.552 --> 13:11.625
Pens.

13:11.697 --> 13:14.795
Pens. Exactly.
You are the best.

13:14.864 --> 13:16.719
Okay, first question.

13:16.784 --> 13:19.916
Um... Uh... Oh, my God.
Why are you so great?

13:23.760 --> 13:25.865
Hey, guys, have you seen Donna?

13:25.936 --> 13:27.725
Look, Forman, no offense.

13:27.792 --> 13:30.858
We got more important things
to worry about here.

13:30.928 --> 13:34.277
Right.
Good luck in jail, guys.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.695
You know, I had
a dream like this once.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.477
Only I was handcuffed
to Cheryl Tiegs...

13:42.544 --> 13:45.064
and you weren't wearing
your sunglasses.

13:55.761 --> 13:58.379
It's not just tonight, you know.

13:58.448 --> 14:01.197
Yeah, she's been blowing me off
more and more.

14:01.265 --> 14:04.428
And she thinks I'll take it,
but I won't. Uh-uh.

14:08.272 --> 14:10.127
Can you lift your feet, please?

14:12.304 --> 14:14.377
Sorry.

14:14.448 --> 14:16.587
And I'm not listenin'
to your little story...

14:16.656 --> 14:18.511
so you really need
to stop talkin' to yourself.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.055
What is wrong with you people?

14:47.120 --> 14:50.732
Come on! That was great!
What, are you on dope?

14:54.384 --> 14:56.937
Oh.

14:57.008 --> 15:00.902
Well, uh, I better go.
My boyfriend's waiting.

15:00.976 --> 15:03.365
Thank you so much
for the interview, Ted.

15:03.440 --> 15:06.255
You're very welcome. You wanna stick around?
I'll let you touch the guitar.

15:06.320 --> 15:11.077
Really?
All right!

15:11.152 --> 15:13.094
Wait, you mean
your <i>guitar</i> guitar, right?

15:13.168 --> 15:14.826
Yeah.

15:14.896 --> 15:18.441
All right!
Ooh!

15:21.040 --> 15:25.034
Michael, I have to say, this has
really been a magically romantic day.

15:25.104 --> 15:28.104
Actually, it's after midnight.

15:28.176 --> 15:32.398
So it is now officially day two...

15:32.464 --> 15:36.076
of magical romance week.

15:37.264 --> 15:41.159
- Ta-da!
- Oh, Michael!

15:44.752 --> 15:47.086
And I've got some great stuff
planned for the rest of the week.

15:47.152 --> 15:50.632
We're gonna have a picnic,
and I'm gonna cook for you.

15:50.704 --> 15:53.966
Oh, and we're gonna go
for a ride on a rickshaw.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.502
You know what? You are
the most romantic man in Point Place.

16:03.568 --> 16:06.951
Yep.

16:07.024 --> 16:10.701
You know, at first,
I thought this was gonna suck.

16:10.768 --> 16:13.157
But now I've really gotten into it...

16:13.232 --> 16:15.567
and I'm glad that we're waiting
seven days to do it.

16:15.632 --> 16:18.479
God, Michael,
you really have changed.

16:18.544 --> 16:21.806
You're so different.

16:21.872 --> 16:25.582
And we're different.

16:25.648 --> 16:28.463
Okay, let's do it.
Now!

16:28.528 --> 16:31.430
Whoa. I-I thought you didn't
wanna do it in a car.

16:31.504 --> 16:33.675
No, Michael, you're so irresistible,
I can't wait.

16:33.744 --> 16:35.599
What about the rest of the week?

16:35.664 --> 16:39.788
I mean, I rented a tux
and patent leather shoes!

16:43.184 --> 16:45.867
Okay, you guys, come on.
Open up. I've had a really bad night.

16:45.936 --> 16:49.067
We need the car, Eric.

16:49.136 --> 16:51.591
We're gonna do it,
and it's gonna be magical.

16:58.672 --> 17:01.770
Oh, Red, it's killing me
that I can't remember.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.695
Huh?

17:03.760 --> 17:06.541
Oh, yeah, yeah, me too.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.877
But I'll tell you
one thing I remember.

17:08.944 --> 17:12.457
I remember that
you loved Manhattans.

17:12.528 --> 17:14.599
Oh, that's right.

17:14.672 --> 17:17.290
That's what I used to drink.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.557
Oh, I haven't had
a Manhattan in 20 years.

17:30.447 --> 17:35.270
Oh, boy, that takes me back.
Oh!

17:38.288 --> 17:40.491
Oh!

17:42.128 --> 17:45.706
Keep 'em coming.
Oh, my. I'm as loose as a goose.

17:47.408 --> 17:49.318
Okay, let's do it.

17:56.464 --> 17:58.603
Upsy-daisy.
I need to use the ladies'...

18:01.008 --> 18:05.645
- You all right?
- I bumped into your butt and fell down!

18:05.712 --> 18:08.746
Sorry. My pants were, uh...

18:08.816 --> 18:12.394
Hi. I'm Red Forman.

18:12.464 --> 18:14.668
How do you do, Red Forman?

18:14.736 --> 18:16.591
I'm Kitty Sigurdson.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.680
You bumped into my butt
and fell down?

18:24.752 --> 18:27.174
And that's how we met?

18:27.248 --> 18:28.938
I'm afraid so.

18:30.608 --> 18:32.713
Well, what do you say
if Eric ever asks...

18:32.784 --> 18:35.784
we go with the
"I punched out a marine" story?

18:35.856 --> 18:39.151
And I wasn't drinking.
I was reading to the blind.

18:39.215 --> 18:41.103
Sounds good.

18:44.880 --> 18:48.228
Oh, my God, Eric.
I have so much to tell you.

18:48.304 --> 18:51.600
I actually met Ted Nugent,
and I got an interview.

18:51.664 --> 18:56.268
And I know I said I'd be right back, but...
It was so exciting!

18:56.336 --> 18:59.151
Oh.
Yeah, my night too.

19:00.176 --> 19:03.210
I met the janitor.

19:03.280 --> 19:06.629
And then, I got to see Kelso
take his pants off.

19:06.703 --> 19:08.776
Rock and roll!

19:10.736 --> 19:13.354
Eric, you're mad at me for going backstage
to meet Ted Nugent?

19:13.423 --> 19:16.904
No, no. I'm mad at you
because you ditched me.

19:16.976 --> 19:19.180
I didn't ditch you.

19:19.248 --> 19:22.663
This was Ted Nugent.
This was a huge opportunity for me.

19:22.736 --> 19:25.932
So, come Monday, I don't have
to just talk about the farm report.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.895
I can talk about the interview,
like... an interviewer.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.335
Well, you know what, Donna?

19:32.400 --> 19:35.848
All I can say is that my mom never
would have bailed on my dad like that.

19:36.880 --> 19:39.116
Yeah, I know.
But they're married.

19:40.592 --> 19:42.763
Okay.

19:42.831 --> 19:44.686
Okay, forget it.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.967
Let's just forget it.

19:51.664 --> 19:55.658
You're sorry.
Everything's fine.

19:57.104 --> 19:58.959
I never said I was sorry.

19:59.024 --> 20:02.188
But... you are, right?

20:02.256 --> 20:04.939
I shouldn't have to be.

20:05.007 --> 20:08.804
We are free!
At last, we are free!

20:08.880 --> 20:12.655
Yeah. They tried to charge us
with selling counterfeit merchandise.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.607
But since Ted Nugent was misspelled,
it wasn't really counterfeit.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.526
It was just stupid.

20:18.480 --> 20:23.019
My ignorance of American youth culture
finally paid off.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.030
Hey, Donna, did you get
to meet the Nuge?

20:25.104 --> 20:28.487
Yeah, it was awesome.
I was right there with Ted Nugent.

20:28.559 --> 20:31.374
The Nuge!

20:31.439 --> 20:33.479
So, can we go now?

20:33.552 --> 20:37.829
Excuse me!
You're ruining the magic!

20:50.224 --> 20:52.046
You going to a clown funeral?

20:53.360 --> 20:56.327
Shut up!
I'm romantic.

20:56.399 --> 21:01.255
- Nice rental, Kelso.
- Joke's on you. I bought it.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.335
Yeah, that's right.
It's mine.

21:03.408 --> 21:05.928
Well, I think
you look handsome, Michael.

21:05.999 --> 21:10.506
Thank you, Jackie.
Hey, Fez, you ever pull a rickshaw?

21:10.576 --> 21:12.234
What's a rickshaw?

21:12.304 --> 21:14.638
Come on. It's fun.
