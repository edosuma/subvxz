03:21.885 --> 03:22.987
Okay, hold on.

03:27.356 --> 03:28.889
Are you really
selling everything?

03:28.891 --> 03:30.427
Yeah. Need the money.

03:36.033 --> 03:37.235
These are nice.

03:37.933 --> 03:38.799
Thanks.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.734
Do I want to know
where you got them?

03:40.736 --> 03:41.771
Does it matter?

03:42.938 --> 03:43.840
No.

03:46.343 --> 03:47.545
How much do you want?

03:48.611 --> 03:49.613
Thirty.

03:50.914 --> 03:52.813
Fifteen.

03:52.815 --> 03:53.750
Twenty.

03:55.718 --> 03:56.686
I'll do twenty.

04:10.033 --> 04:12.067
- Not that.
- Excuse me.

04:12.069 --> 04:13.671
- Excuse yourself.
- Wait outside.

04:17.841 --> 04:18.975
This is extortion.

04:29.552 --> 04:31.055
Your mom had good taste.

04:32.956 --> 04:33.758
Keep it.

04:35.091 --> 04:38.526
Hey, if I ever see you in my house
again, I'll break your arms.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.528
Yeah, I'll still have both
my legs to kick you in the...

04:40.530 --> 04:41.565
Hey, asshole!

04:44.134 --> 04:45.936
And tell your sister
to brush her teeth.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.582
I could take in that guy, I
just needed like thirty seconds.

05:00.783 --> 05:02.851
Now he'll just keep coming back.

05:02.853 --> 05:04.651
What did you
even do to him?

05:04.653 --> 05:05.920
Nothing. Nothing.

05:05.922 --> 05:07.023
Yeah. Bullshit.

05:47.831 --> 05:48.966
Hit it, Robert.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.374
Hey, grandma.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.394
What'll t be today?

06:17.694 --> 06:19.930
Another shitty
soap opera this is?

06:21.131 --> 06:23.831
Or UFC?

06:23.833 --> 06:25.966
Where's the rest
of her pills for this week?

06:25.968 --> 06:27.702
I don't know.

06:27.704 --> 06:29.740
- Oh, we ran out.
- When?

06:31.006 --> 06:32.574
Sunday?

06:32.576 --> 06:34.879
That was five days ago.
Why are you telling me now?

06:35.812 --> 06:37.911
Does it matter?
It's not like they work.

06:37.913 --> 06:39.146
Oscar.

06:39.148 --> 06:41.682
I'll go to pharmacy tomorrow.

06:41.684 --> 06:43.987
No, it's fine. I got it.
I've signed this.

06:45.018 --> 06:45.688
And stop being a shit at school.

06:47.057 --> 06:53.127
"Oscar's been involved in three
physical altercations this week".

06:53.129 --> 06:54.562
Say "ah".

06:54.564 --> 06:57.966
"He's been displaying behaviors that
are against our bullying policy.

06:57.968 --> 07:00.136
Please contact the school
immediately to schedule a meeting".

07:01.704 --> 07:02.572
Nope.

07:07.043 --> 07:07.978
Sean!

07:08.879 --> 07:09.646
Seany!

07:17.521 --> 07:20.855
Man, get your scrawny ass down
here, come take me to this party.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.824
- Give me a minute.
- All right. I'm coming up.

07:22.826 --> 07:25.158
No, no, stay there. I'm coming.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.896
I'm cooking down here, bro.

07:28.932 --> 07:29.833
Uh...

07:30.733 --> 07:32.233
I'm heading out.

07:32.235 --> 07:34.269
There's some cash
on the kitchen counter.

07:34.271 --> 07:36.540
Just order a pizza
and look after grandma.

07:40.944 --> 07:41.979
Just you and me.

07:44.848 --> 07:47.115
Hey, man, why you never
invite me upstairs?

07:47.117 --> 07:48.117
It's messy.

07:50.286 --> 07:52.722
- Where did you get the gas?
- Hey, don't worry about it.

07:54.958 --> 07:57.692
Yo, the night
is going to be epic.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.961
Yeah? We don't even
like these people.

07:59.963 --> 08:01.562
They don't even like me.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.266
True.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.336
Bro, how about you just try to be
like a teenager for one night?

08:08.338 --> 08:11.105
Then you go back to being
a single mom in the morning.

08:11.107 --> 08:12.543
All right, now unlock the door.

08:15.978 --> 08:17.779
Okay, bro, my bad about the mom.

08:17.781 --> 08:18.816
It's fine.

08:23.119 --> 08:25.286
No, no, you got to push.

08:25.288 --> 08:26.286
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.024
The starter's shit,
you got to push the car.

08:40.235 --> 08:41.368
Whoa, whoa!

08:41.370 --> 08:42.206
Hold up!

08:44.707 --> 08:45.808
Starter, my ass.

08:53.148 --> 08:54.585
What's going on?

08:59.889 --> 09:01.292
That's a fun night.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.128
Damn.

09:08.030 --> 09:10.767
Come on bro, we're here,
baby. We're here.

09:12.369 --> 09:14.301
Look at the drink stand.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.738
What's going on, bro?

09:16.873 --> 09:18.008
Hey! What's happening?

09:21.211 --> 09:22.743
Snap.

09:22.745 --> 09:25.646
You know they got drinks...
drinks over there?

09:25.648 --> 09:26.984
Yo, give me five, all right?

09:39.796 --> 09:40.931
Nathan!

10:46.462 --> 10:48.396
Yep.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.298
She looks good.

10:50.933 --> 10:52.934
I think she's
with that Tom guy now.

10:52.936 --> 10:54.167
- For real?
- Mm-Mm.

10:54.169 --> 10:55.837
Nah, I don't think
that's official.

10:55.839 --> 10:58.305
I mean, Chris Harris says he's been making
out with her every day after homecoming.

10:58.307 --> 10:59.409
Really?

11:01.244 --> 11:04.212
But you know we talk shit.
You know that guy talks shit.

11:04.214 --> 11:06.247
All right, my man
is a professional shit-talker.

11:06.249 --> 11:09.517
So, you... right? That
can't... that's not true.

11:09.519 --> 11:12.185
She's... yeah, she's going
to... she's coming right over.

11:12.187 --> 11:14.321
How is it going?
Can't handle the cool kids?

11:14.323 --> 11:16.192
- I'm here for a refill.
- Refill.

11:19.995 --> 11:23.933
Huh? You need me. I'm coming right
now, bro. I'm coming right now.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.440
What's new? How's your grandma?

11:33.442 --> 11:35.343
- She's good. Yeah.
- Good.

11:35.345 --> 11:36.714
- It's so sweet.
- Yeah.

11:37.547 --> 11:38.282
Yeah.

11:39.883 --> 11:41.285
Actually she's not.

11:42.351 --> 11:45.085
She's like completely out of it.

11:45.087 --> 11:47.156
Most days she doesn't
talk much anymore.

11:49.158 --> 11:49.860
Yeah.

11:51.794 --> 11:52.895
It sucks.

11:54.831 --> 11:55.865
Your stepmom?

11:56.799 --> 11:57.934
Still a bitch.

12:03.572 --> 12:05.839
- Is that real?
- Yeah.

12:05.841 --> 12:09.109
Got it a couple
months ago. It's...

12:09.111 --> 12:11.981
It means I'm the way
and the truth and the light.

12:13.148 --> 12:14.317
Tom got one too.

12:16.251 --> 12:19.152
That was like a two
for one thing.

12:19.154 --> 12:20.353
That's cute.

12:20.355 --> 12:22.058
Yeah. We thought so.

12:24.894 --> 12:26.429
So, you guys
are like serious now?

12:28.364 --> 12:32.035
I don't know about serious,
but we have fun.

12:33.570 --> 12:34.938
You mean you have sex.

12:37.373 --> 12:38.275
Jesus.

12:39.142 --> 12:41.275
- Sean, really?
- So, yeah, I'm right.

12:41.277 --> 12:42.312
Yeah, you're right.

12:44.547 --> 12:46.314
Look, I don't know even know
why you would care.

12:46.316 --> 12:47.915
You haven't spoken more
than two words to me

12:47.917 --> 12:49.449
since we got off high school.

12:49.451 --> 12:51.585
I get that you were
going through a lot.

12:51.587 --> 12:54.255
Don't do that.
I don't want your pity.

12:54.257 --> 12:55.258
That's not what that is.

12:57.927 --> 13:00.062
I would have been there
in a second if you asked.

13:01.297 --> 13:02.365
But you weren't.

13:07.437 --> 13:09.337
Have a great night.
I hope that you're good.

13:09.339 --> 13:11.973
Yeah. I'm awesome.

13:11.975 --> 13:13.009
Bet you are.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.348
Alex.

13:19.414 --> 13:20.349
What?

13:21.551 --> 13:23.052
Can't we just talk?

13:24.354 --> 13:25.355
Like not here?

13:27.523 --> 13:28.959
Will you call me?

13:29.926 --> 13:32.028
I got a new phone.
I don't have your number.

13:34.129 --> 13:35.064
Sorry.

13:42.272 --> 13:43.206
Jesus, Sean.

13:44.474 --> 13:45.843
Now you have it.

13:51.547 --> 13:52.914
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.384
Road's waiting. You coming?

14:02.557 --> 14:03.925
Have fun.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.295
We will. Sweet to have you.

14:25.581 --> 14:26.884
Do you feel it?

14:28.685 --> 14:30.517
I feel butterflies.

14:30.519 --> 14:32.456
It's okay. Just a moment.

15:43.426 --> 15:44.461
Hey, yo!

15:46.095 --> 15:48.661
Yo, yo, yo, yo. Yo, I need you to come and
introduce yourself again to this girl

15:48.663 --> 15:50.196
so that she says her name again.

15:50.198 --> 15:51.766
It's like the "Yeladarah",
but I can't...

15:51.768 --> 15:53.136
I think I'm done.

15:54.302 --> 15:56.170
- For real?
- Yeah.

15:56.172 --> 15:58.008
Maybe it's written
in her underwear.

15:59.642 --> 16:00.477
Genius.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.444
Quite the mob.

16:03.446 --> 16:05.278
Go home safe, alright?

16:05.280 --> 16:06.615
I care about you.

16:11.754 --> 16:12.688
Alex!

16:17.259 --> 16:18.128
Alex!

16:35.411 --> 16:36.313
Shit.

17:31.334 --> 17:32.102
Alex!

17:34.769 --> 17:36.138
Alex!

17:40.409 --> 17:41.244
Alex.

17:46.449 --> 17:47.614
Shit.

17:47.616 --> 17:48.818
What am I doing?

19:10.532 --> 19:11.333
Hey.

19:15.371 --> 19:16.573
Just get her legs.

19:56.645 --> 19:57.978
<i>Behind me.</i>

19:57.980 --> 19:59.548
<i>I got your back. Cover me!</i>

20:01.017 --> 20:02.318
<i>I need a distraction!</i>

20:03.420 --> 20:05.385
<i>Goddamn it, Callaghan,
watch your back!</i>

20:05.387 --> 20:06.622
<i>Protect your black ass!</i>

20:10.992 --> 20:13.893
<i>Overnight temperature has
been dropped into the sixties</i>

20:13.895 --> 20:15.365
<i>and tomorrow's forecast...</i>

20:50.900 --> 20:51.601
Hey.

21:11.753 --> 21:12.788
Are you okay?

21:36.912 --> 21:37.913
What happened to you?

21:44.086 --> 21:47.457
If you tell me where you live,
I can take you back home.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.032
There.

22:02.438 --> 22:03.773
Are you sure you're okay?

22:06.674 --> 22:07.576
You're welcome.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.699
You need me to call the police?

23:04.767 --> 23:05.668
Anyone?

23:07.803 --> 23:09.773
Here, help yourself.

24:00.556 --> 24:01.124
Hello?

24:03.959 --> 24:04.460
Hello?

24:06.528 --> 24:07.861
Okay, I'm hanging up.

24:07.863 --> 24:08.730
<i>Please...</i>

24:09.865 --> 24:10.767
<i>don't.</i>

24:12.601 --> 24:14.137
Alex? You okay?

24:15.037 --> 24:15.838
Yeah.

24:18.606 --> 24:20.009
What happened? Where are you?

24:26.548 --> 24:28.548
Where am I?

24:28.550 --> 24:30.185
Casey's Diner on 65.

24:54.076 --> 24:54.943
Hey.

25:00.816 --> 25:02.181
What happened?

25:02.183 --> 25:05.087
She showed up half naked.
So, I gave her some clothes.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.855
I should call the cops.

25:09.857 --> 25:11.961
Please don't.
I'll take her home. Alex.

25:14.095 --> 25:14.797
Come on.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.301
Let's go.

25:27.675 --> 25:29.311
You can crash
at my place if you want.

25:32.247 --> 25:36.753
Just to give you a chance to sleep
off whatever you took at the party.

26:00.308 --> 26:01.310
You want to change?

26:45.287 --> 26:46.122
Hey.

26:47.322 --> 26:50.126
Yeah. Your nose is bleeding.

26:53.461 --> 26:55.198
Just hold that.

26:57.199 --> 26:58.835
Just... wait.

27:01.170 --> 27:02.235
Okay.

27:02.237 --> 27:03.339
Lean your head back.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.374
Okay.

27:06.307 --> 27:09.278
Just... just... okay, okay.

27:15.317 --> 27:16.219
Let me see.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.028
Yeah, okay. I think it stopped.

27:34.336 --> 27:35.805
You won't even...

<i>President Trump has not retreated

<i>...forbidding drivers
to make a right turn off...</i>

29:19.274 --> 29:21.173
Sure thing.

29:21.175 --> 29:24.880
<i>Police have been on scene since last week
cautioning drivers and issuing tickets.</i>

29:25.948 --> 29:28.914
<i>Officers say drivers tell them
they don't see the sign</i>

29:28.916 --> 29:30.749
<i>or that they don't see
the danger.</i>

29:30.751 --> 29:35.924
<i>But police say the risk is real for both
motorists and construction workers.</i>

Is that you, Janey?

30:19.134 --> 30:20.368
You're not Janey.

30:22.436 --> 30:25.272
<i>...is trying to locate
17-year-old Alex Lainey,</i>

30:25.274 --> 30:27.407
<i>reported missing
early this morning.</i>

30:27.409 --> 30:30.677
<i>Last seen at the Southland
Energy reservoir.</i>

30:30.679 --> 30:31.978
- <i>Reporter Jerry Bailey...</i>
- Thanks.

30:31.980 --> 30:35.081
<i>...is on the scene and
she'll bring us up to date...</i>

30:57.972 --> 30:59.241
Oh, fuck.

31:13.422 --> 31:14.490
Good morning, sweetheart.

31:18.226 --> 31:19.161
Where's your brother?

31:21.028 --> 31:23.199
Chocolate for breakfast, really?

31:26.335 --> 31:29.071
I'm going to the store.
Get that mess cleaned up.

31:48.123 --> 31:49.057
Sean?

32:26.694 --> 32:27.730
Shit!

33:05.467 --> 33:07.267
Hey, Sean, you got to see this.

33:07.269 --> 33:09.334
Look, this... this girl, you got
to see what she can do.

33:09.336 --> 33:10.636
She has some crazy
powers or something.

33:10.638 --> 33:13.105
- What, Alex?
- Alex?

33:13.107 --> 33:15.307
We need to get you home. They think
you're like missing or something.

33:15.309 --> 33:17.744
No, no, no, listen,
you have to see this.

33:17.746 --> 33:18.612
Where's grandma?

33:18.614 --> 33:21.147
- She's gone. She went out.
- What?

33:21.149 --> 33:22.748
She's fine. She went out.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.851
- Grandma!
- No, she's fine. She's totally fine.

33:24.853 --> 33:27.519
- What do you mean?
- I mean, she's completely okay. She's back to normal.

33:27.521 --> 33:28.455
What...

33:28.457 --> 33:29.492
Good morning.

33:39.366 --> 33:42.504
What's the matter with you two? Come
on, help me put this stuff away.

33:44.138 --> 33:45.438
You're okay.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.609
Of course I'm okay.

33:49.711 --> 33:52.511
Sorry, this is Alex.

33:52.513 --> 33:53.648
I know. We've met.

33:55.083 --> 33:58.151
You know, some notice would be nice
if someone's going to stay over.

33:58.153 --> 34:01.390
I mean, this place looks
like a circus for the night.

34:02.656 --> 34:04.559
No offense.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.561
You know, you got
Sean all love sick.

34:08.563 --> 34:10.663
- Jesus, grandma.
- Don't you 'Jesus' me.

34:10.665 --> 34:14.634
You don't think she could see it?
Look, your face is all flushed.

34:14.636 --> 34:15.538
It's lovely.

34:16.804 --> 34:19.706
Sean, set the table. Alex, how
would you like your eggs?

34:27.380 --> 34:30.185
Haven't seen my grandma like
that in, I don't know how long.

34:31.252 --> 34:32.420
That was crazy.

34:35.422 --> 34:37.391
Hopefully, she still
remembers how to drive.

34:55.342 --> 34:56.444
Okay, we should hurry.

34:57.712 --> 35:00.116
Can't really have the cops coming
to my house looking for you.

35:02.250 --> 35:03.152
Okay.

35:06.721 --> 35:07.823
What did he give you?

35:08.890 --> 35:09.855
Who?

35:09.857 --> 35:12.660
What do you mean, who?
Tom, your boyfriend.

35:13.727 --> 35:16.261
Someone gave you a pill
at the party.

35:16.263 --> 35:17.864
I can't remember anything.

35:17.866 --> 35:21.170
Then why didn't you ask him to pick you
up when you're out with friends. Why me?

35:32.781 --> 35:33.682
Right.

35:44.658 --> 35:45.627
Where are you going?

35:48.897 --> 35:50.266
Your house is that way.

35:56.303 --> 35:57.736
Seriously?

35:57.738 --> 35:59.240
You don't remember
where you live?

36:00.408 --> 36:01.844
Tell Tom to get better drugs.

36:03.745 --> 36:06.011
Or you could just get
a better boyfriend.

36:06.013 --> 36:06.881
Okay.

36:10.252 --> 36:11.287
That was a joke.

36:32.741 --> 36:34.906
Alex, where the hell
have you been?

36:34.908 --> 36:35.778
I'm sorry.

36:37.279 --> 36:39.415
They found all of your stuff
by the reservoir.

36:40.348 --> 36:41.616
We thought you were dead.

36:43.051 --> 36:44.587
Why don't you step in, son?

36:49.857 --> 36:51.392
Mister Lainey, please.

36:52.294 --> 36:53.960
It's his wife.

36:53.962 --> 36:56.365
Hi, yeah. She just walked
through the door.

36:57.665 --> 36:59.299
You're fine, right?

36:59.301 --> 36:59.935
Alex!

37:02.569 --> 37:04.973
I... I don't know.

37:32.000 --> 37:32.901
Alex!

37:35.937 --> 37:38.540
Just talk to them. You
didn't do anything wrong.

37:53.921 --> 37:56.122
What? What is it?

37:56.124 --> 37:57.759
We shouldn't have come here.

38:01.062 --> 38:02.861
What's over those mountains?

38:02.863 --> 38:05.600
I don't know. Just
hundred miles of desert.

38:14.908 --> 38:16.776
It's not just desert.

38:16.778 --> 38:18.580
- What?
- Alex!

38:28.857 --> 38:31.860
Alex. Honey, just open
the door, please.

38:41.602 --> 38:42.768
Alex.

38:42.770 --> 38:44.069
Can you just open
the door for me?

38:44.071 --> 38:45.406
Alex, open the door.

38:46.774 --> 38:47.906
I think I should go.

38:47.908 --> 38:49.574
Alex!

38:49.576 --> 38:51.779
Alex, open
the goddamn door right now!

38:53.180 --> 38:55.016
Alex, open the door right now!

39:30.951 --> 39:32.018
Alex!

39:32.020 --> 39:33.219
What? How did...?

39:33.221 --> 39:35.053
Alex! Come back here!

39:35.055 --> 39:35.691
Alex.

39:39.127 --> 39:40.526
Alex.

39:40.528 --> 39:42.462
Wait! Where are you going?

39:42.464 --> 39:43.766
I don't belong here.

39:45.767 --> 39:47.136
Alex? Alex!

39:49.471 --> 39:49.905
Alex!

39:53.140 --> 39:53.941
Alex!

39:56.644 --> 39:57.613
Slow down!

40:12.861 --> 40:16.863
<i>Caucasian female,
five-seven, Alex Lainey, seventeen.</i>

40:16.865 --> 40:20.665
<i>Caucasian male, five-eight, seventeen
in black and white number one,</i>

40:20.667 --> 40:22.970
<i>one, six, sending out
AMBER Alert.</i>

40:26.073 --> 40:29.040
You can just go back and tell them
that I forced you to come with me.

40:29.042 --> 40:31.446
You did force me. You
pushed me out of window.

40:36.517 --> 40:37.919
How did you know
you could do that?

40:41.022 --> 40:43.556
I didn't know. It just happened.

40:43.558 --> 40:45.027
That doesn't just happen.

40:53.734 --> 40:55.671
You got to tell
me something, just

40:56.837 --> 40:59.475
anything so I don't feel
like I'm losing my mind.

41:08.783 --> 41:09.651
I was under water.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.656
It's like I was drowning...
I was drowning.

41:18.158 --> 41:19.528
I should be dead.

41:24.098 --> 41:26.201
But there was something
in the water with me.

41:37.245 --> 41:38.714
I can still feel it.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.520
What does it feel like?

42:25.093 --> 42:26.795
So, you're like...

42:27.761 --> 42:28.629
what, like

42:30.631 --> 42:32.233
magnetic or something?

42:33.767 --> 42:34.802
I don't know.

42:40.674 --> 42:41.310
Wait.

42:50.817 --> 42:51.984
Okay. Do it again.

42:51.986 --> 42:53.152
Do what again?

42:53.154 --> 42:55.254
Your thing. Do it again.

42:55.256 --> 42:58.223
I don't know how to do it.
I don't... it just happens.

42:58.225 --> 42:59.760
Just do what you did.

43:14.709 --> 43:16.278
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

43:17.345 --> 43:19.113
Wait, wait, wait,
just put it back.

43:20.214 --> 43:21.683
Just let me try
one more time.

43:56.984 --> 43:58.116
Alex.

43:58.118 --> 43:59.120
Is it working?

44:01.888 --> 44:03.724
Damn it, I thought
that I had it.

44:37.892 --> 44:39.326
We need to get off the road.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.015
What can I get you?

45:01.216 --> 45:06.154
Sprite, Cherry Coke and two
chicken fingers with fries.

45:21.301 --> 45:22.269
You okay?

45:27.375 --> 45:28.243
I'm fine.

45:35.316 --> 45:36.582
It's Cherry Coke.

45:36.584 --> 45:38.252
I know you hate that diet stuff.

45:39.821 --> 45:41.957
Well, you used to.

45:51.299 --> 45:54.002
You seriously don't
remember anything?

45:57.604 --> 45:59.106
You know when you have a dream

46:00.341 --> 46:02.540
and it's so intense

46:02.542 --> 46:04.445
you think that
it's actually happening?

46:06.980 --> 46:09.316
But then by the time you
brush your teeth, it's all gone.

46:12.118 --> 46:13.953
That's how my life feels.

46:13.955 --> 46:16.254
I know that all this stuff
happened, I just...

46:16.256 --> 46:18.159
I can't remember any of it.

46:20.127 --> 46:22.430
Up until last night
when you picked me up.

46:30.971 --> 46:32.207
I'm glad you called me.

46:36.509 --> 46:37.546
Do you mean that?

46:40.247 --> 46:41.081
Yeah.

46:48.656 --> 46:50.558
I feel like we're
Bonnie and Clyde.

46:52.593 --> 46:54.395
I don't know who that is.

46:56.096 --> 46:58.263
Chicken tenders.

46:58.265 --> 46:59.232
Thank you.

46:59.234 --> 47:00.500
Now listen, this ain't
none of my business

47:00.502 --> 47:03.371
but those boys over there have
been watching you for a while.

47:09.343 --> 47:11.243
Can I get this to go?

47:11.245 --> 47:12.180
Sure, baby.

47:14.482 --> 47:16.017
- Let's go.
- What's wrong?

47:26.093 --> 47:28.062
Hey, you're Alex Lainey, right?

47:29.529 --> 47:31.298
I know you guys
are like fugitives.

47:36.636 --> 47:38.172
Dude, what did I tell you?

47:39.607 --> 47:41.172
See?

47:41.174 --> 47:42.540
I thought you were dead.

47:42.542 --> 47:44.144
Where the hell have you been?

47:46.379 --> 47:47.481
Did he kidnap you?

47:49.149 --> 47:49.917
No.

47:50.817 --> 47:52.216
Whatever, just get
in the truck, Alex.

47:52.218 --> 47:54.285
She's not going with you.

47:54.287 --> 47:56.020
I don't even know
who you are, man.

47:56.022 --> 47:58.259
I'm taking you home
to your family.

47:59.326 --> 48:00.359
Let's go.

48:00.361 --> 48:01.292
Hey.

48:01.294 --> 48:02.560
- Alex.
- Sean!

48:02.562 --> 48:04.064
- Sean!
- Alex!

48:41.669 --> 48:43.402
You need to get in the car.

48:43.404 --> 48:44.669
Sorry, who are you?

48:44.671 --> 48:46.404
If you want to make it through
the night, get in the car now.

48:46.406 --> 48:48.339
- Thanks, we're fine.
- No, you're not.

48:48.341 --> 48:50.375
- There are people looking for you.
- Yeah, we know that.

48:50.377 --> 48:52.444
I'm not talking about police.

48:52.446 --> 48:54.348
Hey. You don't recognize me?

48:56.549 --> 48:58.153
I gave you a ride last night.

49:04.392 --> 49:06.428
They'll find her
just like I did.

49:10.497 --> 49:13.698
I'm guessing you have a lot of questions
about what's happening to you.

49:13.700 --> 49:15.102
I can give you some answers.

49:16.203 --> 49:17.339
But you need to trust me.

49:20.140 --> 49:22.774
Really nice of you.
I think we're...

49:22.776 --> 49:23.711
Alex.

49:26.546 --> 49:27.314
Alex.

49:30.216 --> 49:31.552
This is a bad idea.

49:51.104 --> 49:52.272
Put this on.

49:56.377 --> 49:58.176
What is it?

49:58.178 --> 49:59.146
It's made of lead.

50:02.450 --> 50:03.551
Like at the dentist.

50:05.553 --> 50:06.354
Why?

50:08.254 --> 50:09.256
Protection.

50:13.694 --> 50:14.763
Protection from what?

50:18.499 --> 50:19.433
From her.

50:35.149 --> 50:37.815
I've seen this stuff on
YouTube. It's all bullshit.

50:37.817 --> 50:43.622
You're right. Most of it is grainy home
video of flying saucers, abduction stories.

50:43.624 --> 50:46.424
They're just distractions
to throw in the six o'clock news

50:46.426 --> 50:49.564
to make sure that any real evidence
will get lost in the noise.

50:51.832 --> 50:53.234
But it's hard to hide now.

50:54.535 --> 50:55.837
Everyone has a camera.

50:57.537 --> 51:00.272
So, you're saying
those are like,

51:00.274 --> 51:03.207
- what, alien spaceships?
- No, no, no, no.

51:03.209 --> 51:05.777
Not spaceships, just light.

51:05.779 --> 51:07.415
No mass to slow you down.

51:13.254 --> 51:15.453
The people who are
looking for her are terrified

51:15.455 --> 51:17.624
because they have no idea
what they're dealing with.

51:18.725 --> 51:20.662
And how could you
possibly know that?

51:22.196 --> 51:23.096
Because I worked for them.

51:24.932 --> 51:27.167
They used to send me
to clean up the mess.

51:28.368 --> 51:30.502
Change hospital records.

51:30.504 --> 51:31.605
Destroy evidence.

51:32.605 --> 51:33.674
Whatever I had to.

51:36.343 --> 51:38.745
Are there others like me?

51:42.216 --> 51:42.784
Yes.

51:43.817 --> 51:46.720
There were seven other
close proximity centers.

51:50.890 --> 51:51.625
More?

51:52.926 --> 51:55.227
What happened to them?

51:55.229 --> 51:57.232
None of them survived
more than six hours...

51:59.265 --> 52:00.134
until you.

52:04.837 --> 52:07.406
- I'm going to die?
- No, you're not going to die.

52:07.408 --> 52:10.408
Look, she's fine. Show him
what you can do. You get...

52:10.410 --> 52:12.779
you can do... you just... Alex.

52:19.520 --> 52:20.551
Alex.

52:20.553 --> 52:21.388
Hey.

52:22.957 --> 52:26.959
Every minute you're with her, you've
been exposed to a kind of radiation.

52:26.961 --> 52:29.594
You need to get as far away
as can you from her.

52:29.596 --> 52:31.295
I'm not leaving her,
she needs my help.

52:31.297 --> 52:34.435
No, no, no, no. There is
nothing more you can do.

52:45.645 --> 52:49.281
When your hair starts falling out
and you're too weak to stand,

52:49.283 --> 52:50.785
you will wish
you took my advice.

52:58.459 --> 52:59.294
Why here?

53:01.328 --> 53:04.328
Why not like
Washington or Tokyo?

53:04.330 --> 53:05.499
Because we called it.

53:15.843 --> 53:19.844
In 1997, Chinese radio
telescopes picked up a signal,

53:19.846 --> 53:21.812
thousands of years old.

53:21.814 --> 53:23.681
It was mathematical.

53:23.683 --> 53:27.819
Simple equations that create
infinitely complex symbols

53:27.821 --> 53:29.691
like characters
from a new language.

53:30.790 --> 53:32.227
Well, new to us.

53:40.500 --> 53:41.736
So, we built this.

53:46.339 --> 53:47.739
What does it do?

53:47.741 --> 53:50.642
Every night we project
the symbols into the sky,

53:50.644 --> 53:52.913
hoping whoever sent it
first is watching.

53:54.881 --> 53:57.251
We called and they answered.

54:00.787 --> 54:01.855
She's the proof.

54:03.624 --> 54:04.424
What?

54:08.828 --> 54:09.897
You were right.

54:10.897 --> 54:12.033
It's not just desert.

54:19.707 --> 54:21.373
So, what do we do?

54:21.375 --> 54:23.778
I know the protocols.
I can buy you some time,

54:24.745 --> 54:26.647
so we can figure out the
best way to go public with it.

54:28.948 --> 54:30.717
We will leave first
thing in the morning.

54:32.386 --> 54:33.955
I think we should get some rest.

54:36.422 --> 54:37.725
The trailer next door is empty.

54:38.625 --> 54:39.661
You can sleep there.

54:49.136 --> 54:50.368
Sean?

54:50.370 --> 54:51.370
<i>Oscar.</i>

54:51.372 --> 54:53.138
Where are you?

54:53.140 --> 54:55.707
What the hell's going on? There's like a whole
bunch of cops that are looking for you.

54:55.709 --> 54:56.576
<i>Is it her?</i>

54:57.578 --> 54:58.579
<i>It's her, isn't it?</i>

54:59.479 --> 55:00.544
<i>She showed you?</i>

55:00.546 --> 55:01.048
Yeah.

55:02.750 --> 55:05.116
See? I told you I wasn't lying.

55:05.118 --> 55:06.618
<i>Yeah.</i>

55:06.620 --> 55:07.555
<i>You were right.</i>

55:09.522 --> 55:10.524
<i>How's grandma?</i>

55:11.558 --> 55:14.095
She's great actually.
When are you coming back?

55:16.096 --> 55:16.962
Soon.

55:16.964 --> 55:17.999
<i>Like, when?</i>

55:21.968 --> 55:22.736
Oscar.

55:25.138 --> 55:26.504
Oscar.

55:26.506 --> 55:28.041
<i>I can't hear you. Sean?</i>

55:29.475 --> 55:30.142
<i>Hello?</i>

55:30.144 --> 55:31.678
I... I can't hear you.

55:32.879 --> 55:34.615
- Sean?
- Oscar.

55:37.683 --> 55:38.653
I love you.

55:39.586 --> 55:40.421
What?

55:41.654 --> 55:42.857
<i>I said I love you.</i>

55:46.058 --> 55:47.528
<i>Just come home.</i>

56:06.046 --> 56:07.615
You sure that's a good idea?

56:09.116 --> 56:10.418
Do you trust him?

56:11.151 --> 56:12.587
- Cal?
- Yeah.

56:15.154 --> 56:16.990
I mean, I don't know. It's...

56:18.459 --> 56:20.192
It's a lot.

56:20.194 --> 56:21.796
It's kind of a crazy day.

56:26.700 --> 56:28.102
You're like part alien?

56:29.169 --> 56:30.969
It's not funny.

56:30.971 --> 56:31.806
No?

56:32.738 --> 56:33.740
That's what he says.

56:35.676 --> 56:36.511
Hell.

56:38.111 --> 56:40.745
You don't believe
anything he said?

56:40.747 --> 56:41.749
I don't know.

56:42.683 --> 56:43.918
I don't know what I am.

56:48.921 --> 56:50.857
It's okay. I'm cool with it.

56:54.528 --> 56:55.596
Really?

57:09.008 --> 57:10.510
Where did you get this?

57:14.814 --> 57:15.883
You gave it to me.

57:22.189 --> 57:23.991
I wish I could remember more.

57:25.758 --> 57:26.760
You're lucky.

57:32.665 --> 57:35.232
There's so much
I wish I could forget.

57:35.234 --> 57:36.203
Like what?

57:38.171 --> 57:39.040
Just like

57:41.941 --> 57:44.945
my mom leaving, my grandma
getting sick right after,

57:47.281 --> 57:48.749
what happened between us.

58:02.962 --> 58:04.161
What?

58:04.163 --> 58:05.263
Nothing.

58:05.265 --> 58:06.933
- What is that?
- It's...

58:09.836 --> 58:12.906
I think it's from when you pushed me out
the window. I think your hand was there.

58:13.941 --> 58:15.042
Does it hurt?

58:16.008 --> 58:16.977
It's all right.

58:20.980 --> 58:22.549
I don't want to hurt you.

58:32.625 --> 58:34.194
I think we should get some rest.

01:01:53.225 --> 01:01:54.461
Move, move, move!

01:01:55.696 --> 01:01:57.227
- ...perimeter.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

01:01:57.229 --> 01:01:58.798
No sign of break-in.

01:02:02.535 --> 01:02:03.269
Hello, Cal.

01:02:05.104 --> 01:02:06.805
I didn't expect
to see you again.

01:02:06.807 --> 01:02:08.839
You didn't even say goodbye.

01:02:08.841 --> 01:02:10.845
Well, I see you stole
some of our stuff.

01:02:13.846 --> 01:02:14.948
How did you find me?

01:02:15.915 --> 01:02:17.484
We assumed you'd
try tracking it yourself.

01:02:18.384 --> 01:02:19.854
Anything?

01:02:22.221 --> 01:02:23.189
She stable?

01:02:26.292 --> 01:02:27.260
Twenty-eight hours.

01:02:28.361 --> 01:02:29.960
Incredible.

01:02:29.962 --> 01:02:32.096
She's different
from the others, Kate.

01:02:32.098 --> 01:02:34.198
You need to see
that for yourself.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.269
I plan to.

01:02:38.404 --> 01:02:40.538
We have her. She's on the move.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:41.473
Heading southwest on...

01:02:41.475 --> 01:02:43.377
They're just trying
to connect with us.

01:02:44.377 --> 01:02:45.813
Take care of yourself, Cal.

01:03:20.013 --> 01:03:20.547
Alex!

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:24.417
Alex.

01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:27.585
Sean, just let me get on the
bus and get out of your life.

01:03:27.587 --> 01:03:29.254
I don't want you out of my life.

01:03:29.256 --> 01:03:31.388
Alex, I don't want
you out of my life.

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:32.158
Sean.

01:03:33.426 --> 01:03:36.194
You're sick and I'm
making you sicker.

01:03:36.196 --> 01:03:38.263
- That's what Cal said.
- No, Cal was wrong, okay?

01:03:38.265 --> 01:03:39.897
Cal was wrong.

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:43.100
My grandma hasn't said a word in two years
and then you show up and suddenly she's...

01:03:43.102 --> 01:03:45.469
she's speaking and she's normal.

01:03:45.471 --> 01:03:48.174
That's not some coincidence.
You did that.

01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:51.241
That's crazy.

01:03:51.243 --> 01:03:52.410
- Yeah.
- It's not true.

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:53.513
Yeah, it's crazy.

01:03:55.015 --> 01:03:56.147
It is.

01:03:56.149 --> 01:03:58.586
Or maybe it's the first thing
that makes any sense.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.252
Door's closing.

01:04:02.254 --> 01:04:04.090
One minute, please.
Just give us one minute.

01:04:07.227 --> 01:04:09.196
You can get on that bus
but I'm coming with you.

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.870
You're going to get
yourself killed.

01:04:29.149 --> 01:04:30.250
I'm not dead yet.

01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:34.741
Is there a problem?

01:06:43.383 --> 01:06:45.352
Everybody, stay
in your seat, please.

01:06:53.625 --> 01:06:55.125
Don't let them take me.

01:06:55.127 --> 01:06:56.296
Just keep your head down.

01:07:26.258 --> 01:07:27.760
- Get off!
- That's it, yeah.

01:07:30.162 --> 01:07:31.728
Don't hurt her!

01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:33.364
What are you doing to her?

01:07:33.366 --> 01:07:34.134
Alex!

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.870
Alex! Leave her alone!

01:07:38.872 --> 01:07:40.370
Leave her alone!

01:07:40.372 --> 01:07:41.407
Alex!

01:07:42.542 --> 01:07:43.841
Alex!

01:07:43.843 --> 01:07:46.680
Let her go! Let her go!

01:07:50.283 --> 01:07:51.384
Alex!

01:09:44.763 --> 01:09:46.232
What are you doing to her?

01:09:47.432 --> 01:09:48.769
We're trying to help her.

01:09:52.305 --> 01:09:53.471
I want to see her.

01:09:56.409 --> 01:09:57.574
Sean.

01:09:57.576 --> 01:09:58.811
I want to see her!

01:10:01.513 --> 01:10:03.880
The radiation that's been
emitted has hurt a lot of people

01:10:03.882 --> 01:10:05.851
and it seems
to be contained in Alex.

01:10:06.886 --> 01:10:09.386
You've had secondary exposure
which has made you very sick.

01:10:09.388 --> 01:10:13.426
So, until we can get our hands
around this, you can't get near her.

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:15.561
I'm sorry.

01:11:15.555 --> 01:11:19.389
You've been given a localized paralytic
agent to immobilize you from the neck down.

01:11:19.391 --> 01:11:21.459
It's for your own safety.

01:11:21.461 --> 01:11:22.695
Do you understand?

01:11:26.766 --> 01:11:28.302
Nice to meet you, Alex.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:38.678
We've been trying to establish contact
with this phenomena for a long time.

01:11:39.912 --> 01:11:43.083
We're like children
trying to say our first words.

01:11:44.784 --> 01:11:48.455
All the money and resources we've
invested, it didn't matter.

01:11:49.789 --> 01:11:50.857
They chose your friend.

01:11:52.859 --> 01:11:54.494
We don't know
if it was even intentional,

01:11:55.927 --> 01:12:00.063
but we believe they're using Alex
as a way to communicate with us.

01:12:00.065 --> 01:12:00.833
What are they?

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:05.772
That's a tough
question to answer.

01:12:06.838 --> 01:12:12.611
Our technology has had little success
getting information from them or it.

01:12:21.788 --> 01:12:25.525
We know that they're radiating in the
full EM spectrum and that they're old.

01:12:26.993 --> 01:12:29.896
So old that they may have been
there from the beginning.

01:12:31.164 --> 01:12:32.532
Beginning of what?

01:12:33.565 --> 01:12:34.433
The Big Bang.

01:12:35.834 --> 01:12:37.136
Creation, everything.

01:12:41.207 --> 01:12:43.977
We want to know where
they came from and why they're here.

01:12:44.877 --> 01:12:48.144
We think they've been attempting to
integrate their consciousness with ours.

01:12:48.146 --> 01:12:49.913
You're seeing this?

01:12:49.915 --> 01:12:54.852
Up until now those efforts have
proved problematic. Our biology rejected them.

01:12:54.854 --> 01:12:56.019
Is she conscious?

01:12:56.021 --> 01:12:56.989
People died.

01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:02.162
She's seeing something.

01:13:29.888 --> 01:13:31.091
Would you excuse me?

01:13:37.562 --> 01:13:40.563
She's going into cardiac arrest.
We need to intubate. Let's go!

01:13:40.565 --> 01:13:44.134
<i>Radiation
levels have exceeded safety limits.</i>

01:13:44.136 --> 01:13:45.906
All right. Shut it down, now.

01:13:58.049 --> 01:14:01.788
<i>Radiation levels
have exceeded safety limits.</i>

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:37.757
<i>Proceed to designated
quarantine zones.</i>

01:14:58.043 --> 01:14:58.944
Alex.

01:15:24.003 --> 01:15:25.005
Alex...

01:15:30.842 --> 01:15:32.011
<i>Alex...</i>

01:15:39.384 --> 01:15:40.921
<i>Alex...</i>

01:17:40.071 --> 01:17:41.007
Alex.

01:17:43.042 --> 01:17:44.076
Alex Lainey.

01:18:39.899 --> 01:18:40.900
Is this us?

01:19:29.448 --> 01:19:30.517
It's okay.

01:21:01.673 --> 01:21:02.908
Am I dead?

01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:09.315
That's good.

01:22:11.476 --> 01:22:12.412
Alex...

01:22:14.445 --> 01:22:15.414
Alex.

01:22:16.781 --> 01:22:18.381
Don't go.

01:22:18.383 --> 01:22:19.384
Just stay.

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:26.192
Let her go.

01:22:29.293 --> 01:22:30.296
We're here.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:32.731
It'll get better now.

01:24:41.793 --> 01:24:42.762
Oh!

01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:47.500
Son of a... bag of tits. Shit!

01:24:54.405 --> 01:24:55.408
That was sick.

01:24:56.475 --> 01:24:57.677
Come on, let's go.

01:25:00.378 --> 01:25:01.881
Would have been sicker
if I landed.

01:25:03.848 --> 01:25:04.784
You'll get it.

01:25:08.954 --> 01:25:10.890
You think they're going
to watch you forever?

01:25:12.723 --> 01:25:13.525
Yeah.
