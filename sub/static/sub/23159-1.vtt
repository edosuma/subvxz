02:04.968 --> 02:09.234
<i>Animal, get up.
Betty Grable's on the phone.</i>

02:12.910 --> 02:15.777
<i>Anybody asks for your papers,
you're French laborers.</i>

02:15.812 --> 02:18.110
<i>Here's your map.</i>

02:18.148 --> 02:20.810
<i>- Money. Swiss francs.
- Roger.</i>

02:20.851 --> 02:24.753
<i>- Let's hear it once more, boys.
- We've been over it a hundred times.</i>

02:24.788 --> 02:27.848
<i>We stick to the forest going west
until we hit the Danube.</i>

02:27.891 --> 02:30.121
<i>- We follow the Danube up to Linz.
- Check.</i>

02:30.160 --> 02:33.288
<i>In Linz we have a barge
and go all the way to Ulm.</i>

02:36.400 --> 02:41.235
<i>- Stop it, Joey. Joey. Go back to sleep.
- Once in Ulm we lie low until...</i>

02:41.271 --> 02:44.638
<i>There are few people
I'll stay up past midnight to see.</i>

02:44.675 --> 02:47.007
<i>William Holden is one of them.</i>

02:47.044 --> 02:50.377
<i>Yodel, boys,
so we'll know you're there. It's a breeze.</i>

02:50.414 --> 02:53.474
<i>- Stay out of this, Sefton.
- Just one question.</i>

02:53.517 --> 02:55.542
<i>Did you calculate the risk?</i>

02:55.586 --> 02:58.885
<i>As a kid,
Stalag 17 had been one of my favorite films.</i>

02:58.922 --> 03:03.484
<i>I guess because it had everything -
heroes, humor, action -</i>

03:03.527 --> 03:05.791
<i>all the stuff a boy of ten craves.</i>

03:05.829 --> 03:07.490
<i>I hadn't seen it since then</i>

03:07.531 --> 03:11.331
<i>and almost didn't buy the tape for fear
the film might have lost its appeal.</i>

03:11.368 --> 03:13.962
<i>It hadn't,</i>

03:14.004 --> 03:18.134
<i>even though I'd lived my own
version of Stalag 17 since then.</i>

03:18.175 --> 03:20.166
<i>Ready.</i>

03:21.645 --> 03:24.273
<i>You show 'em, boys. Take care.</i>

03:24.314 --> 03:26.874
<i>You've got ten minutes
to get through the tunnel.</i>

03:26.917 --> 03:32.355
<i>That'll bring you out just as the Jerries
are changing shifts. Blondie, Cookie.</i>

03:53.276 --> 03:55.141
Sh, sh, sh.

03:55.178 --> 03:56.475
Sorry, sorry.

04:03.654 --> 04:06.316
You guys really gotta get in shape.

04:08.125 --> 04:11.754
The locals are working the rice paddy.
We gotta go round.

04:11.795 --> 04:14.855
No time.
Charlie can't be far more than 200m behind.

04:14.898 --> 04:18.800
T.C., don't leave me. Ivan will do the same
thing to me he did to Cookie.

04:18.834 --> 04:21.827
Ivan's not gonna get you. Don't worry.

04:26.677 --> 04:27.803
Sh!

04:54.137 --> 04:56.264
Sorry, Nu <i>z</i> o. Sh, sh.

04:56.306 --> 04:58.069
Easy, Nu <i>z</i> o, easy.

05:27.437 --> 05:29.871
 <i>O</i> h, God. It's Ivan.

05:29.906 --> 05:32.204
We've had it, man.

05:33.810 --> 05:38.577
Not yet. Come on. Get up.
Let's get the hell outta here.

05:39.216 --> 05:41.207
T.C.

05:44.254 --> 05:46.347
I gotta go back. Go back.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.653
I gotta kill him. Got to kill Ivan.

05:48.692 --> 05:50.592
With what?

05:50.627 --> 05:52.492
My bare hands.

05:54.664 --> 05:57.656
Come on, T.C. We'll make it.

05:57.701 --> 06:00.568
Shh. Shh.

06:04.574 --> 06:08.442
<i>- They'll be under the wire soon.
- Looks good outside.</i>

06:08.478 --> 06:10.446
<i>I hope they hit the Danube before dawn.</i>

06:10.480 --> 06:13.278
<i>They have a chance.
It's the longest night of the year.</i>

06:13.316 --> 06:16.649
<i>- I bet they make it to Friedrichshafen.
- Or Switzerland.</i>

06:16.686 --> 06:19.587
<i>And I bet they don't get out of the forest.</i>

06:19.623 --> 06:22.353
<i>- What kind of crack is that?
- No crack.</i>

06:22.392 --> 06:24.519
<i>Two packs of cigarettes say they don't.</i>

06:24.561 --> 06:26.893
<i>He'd make book
on his own mother getting hit.</i>

06:26.930 --> 06:28.761
<i>- Anybody call?
- Sefton, butt out.</i>

06:28.799 --> 06:30.460
<i>I'll cover the whole pot.</i>

07:10.640 --> 07:12.471
Good morning, Magnum.

07:13.510 --> 07:15.501
Morning, Higgins.

07:16.980 --> 07:18.971
Guys.

07:34.164 --> 07:37.361
There's some tea on the table,
and some scones.

07:38.802 --> 07:42.966
You might try the strawberry jam.
It's really quite good.

07:43.006 --> 07:46.703
<i>O</i> Id comrade from the Burma campaign
sent it to me.

07:46.743 --> 07:48.404
Tanker Morand.

07:48.445 --> 07:52.779
Got his name when he single-handedly
took on a Japanese tank and knocked it out.

07:54.651 --> 07:57.051
Now he's selling jam in Devonshire.

07:58.455 --> 08:01.947
Higgins,
the Queen's birthday's coming up, right?

08:03.793 --> 08:05.624
Yes.

08:05.662 --> 08:08.563
- And those tiny toy cannons you play with...
- Not toys.

08:08.598 --> 08:11.533
They're working miniature replicas.

08:11.568 --> 08:13.627
Don't they require a special powder?

08:13.670 --> 08:15.865
Number three black powder, yes.

08:15.906 --> 08:19.000
Which is very difficult
to find in the islands.

08:19.042 --> 08:23.445
Not only in the islands.
Hardly anyone manufactures it anymore.

08:23.480 --> 08:26.643
The flashpoint is too low, only 875 degrees.

08:26.683 --> 08:31.643
Precisely the flashpoint of
those match heads you're decapitating.

08:31.688 --> 08:34.623
Actually, these match heads
are nearer 850.

08:34.658 --> 08:37.149
Which is close enough to pulveri <i>z</i> e

08:37.193 --> 08:40.253
and turn into powder
for your teeny, tiny toy cannons,

08:40.297 --> 08:43.823
so you can fire a salute
to the Queen on her birthday.

08:46.670 --> 08:49.969
Magnum, that's an absolutely
extraordinary deduction.

08:50.006 --> 08:51.735
Thank you very much.

08:55.111 --> 08:57.102
But wrong.

09:05.422 --> 09:06.446
<i>O</i> h.

09:06.489 --> 09:09.686
- T.C.'s picking me up for my practice run.
- Magnum!

09:09.726 --> 09:11.091
Yeah?

09:11.127 --> 09:14.927
Don't tell me he's going to land
that Easter egg on this estate!

09:14.965 --> 09:16.956
<i>O</i> K, I won't tell you.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.632
- Hi, Higgie, baby.
- Don't "Hi, Higgie, baby" me.

09:53.670 --> 09:56.400
This is the last time you will land here.

09:56.439 --> 09:59.897
I warned you the next time you landed here
without permission,

09:59.943 --> 10:02.002
I'd have the FAA revoke your license.

10:02.045 --> 10:04.741
- I got permission.
- You got permission from whom?

10:04.781 --> 10:06.646
Him.

10:06.683 --> 10:10.244
Him? Him? He can't grant you permission.

10:10.286 --> 10:11.548
Higgins.

10:11.588 --> 10:15.581
That Tanker Morand
strawberry jam is just terrific.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.593
- What?
- Is something wrong?

10:17.627 --> 10:20.755
- Wrong? Wrong?
- Do you hear an echo?

10:20.797 --> 10:23.891
You can't grant him permission
to land here <i>. O</i> nly I can.

10:23.933 --> 10:25.366
<i>O</i> r Robin Masters.

10:26.936 --> 10:29.268
Robin Masters granted him permission?

10:29.305 --> 10:33.867
I didn't say that. I said in addition to you,
Robin Masters could grant permission.

10:33.910 --> 10:35.309
A- ha!

10:35.345 --> 10:38.644
So you freely admit
that you had no right, no right at all,

10:38.681 --> 10:42.208
to tell T.C. that
he could land on this estate?

10:42.252 --> 10:44.277
Higgins... you got me there.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.753
- T.C.
- Hmm?

10:45.789 --> 10:48.781
- I couldn't tell you you could land here.
<i>- O</i> h.

10:48.825 --> 10:52.420
In that case, I guess we'd better go.

10:55.665 --> 10:57.155
Aloha.

10:59.636 --> 11:01.126
Clear.

11:16.419 --> 11:18.910
Man, if he had a surface-to-air missile,

11:18.955 --> 11:21.446
I do believe the old boy would use it.

11:21.491 --> 11:23.356
No. No.

11:53.056 --> 11:56.617
Lieutenant MacReynolds
reporting as ordered, sir.

11:59.462 --> 12:01.589
Lieutenant, I understand you're a friend

12:01.631 --> 12:04.099
of an ex-naval officer named Magnum.

12:05.301 --> 12:07.292
Er... Yes, sir. I know him.

12:07.337 --> 12:12.570
Know him well enough to allow him access
to your computer station from time to time?

12:13.843 --> 12:16.937
- Sir?
- It's a simple question, Lieutenant.

12:16.980 --> 12:21.349
Did you or did you not allow a civilian
to use top-secret navy computers?

12:22.752 --> 12:24.811
Er, yes, sir, I did, but I can explain.

12:24.854 --> 12:28.051
I'm not interested in explanations, Lieutenant.

12:28.091 --> 12:32.824
If you violated navy security,
you will be court-martialed.

12:32.862 --> 12:36.889
- But I never did, sir, not once.
- Is that right, Colonel?

12:38.468 --> 12:40.459
Not in my opinion, sir.

12:52.782 --> 12:54.613
Hey, did you see that?

12:54.651 --> 12:55.709
Uh-huh.

12:55.752 --> 12:58.744
Probably a test missile
over at Kahoolawe.

12:58.788 --> 13:03.384
The marines are all on maneuvers there
through the tenth. I'll be there this weekend.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.321
You like being in the reserves?

13:06.362 --> 13:10.799
Ah, it's <i>O</i> K.
You know the peacetime military.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.529
All regulations and no action.

13:14.404 --> 13:16.929
Now, of course, if you were to join...

13:16.973 --> 13:20.204
- No.
- Just a thought.

13:26.082 --> 13:28.676
<i>O</i> K, we're six miles out.

13:29.385 --> 13:32.013
<i>O</i> h, boy <i>. O</i> ughta be a pretty good workout.

13:32.055 --> 13:34.182
Swells are running pretty high out there.

13:34.224 --> 13:38.923
Last year during the race
the swells were 30ft. These are just babies.

13:39.929 --> 13:43.228
- Doesn't it bother you?
- What? The swells?

13:43.266 --> 13:46.429
No, all those big fish
that gotta be down there.

13:48.137 --> 13:49.570
No.

13:49.606 --> 13:51.540
It would bother me.

14:18.368 --> 14:21.132
<i>I'd been racing su</i> rf <i>skis for three years,</i>

14:21.170 --> 14:23.866
<i>I'd even entered
the Molokai to Oahu race once,</i>

14:23.906 --> 14:27.740
<i>27 miles through one of
the roughest water channels in the world,</i>

14:27.777 --> 14:32.646
<i>and in all that time,
I never once worried about big fish.</i>

14:34.417 --> 14:36.817
<i>Sometimes I could kill T.C.</i>

15:04.714 --> 15:06.875
* I got a date with an angel

15:06.916 --> 15:09.612
* Gotta meet her at seven

15:11.654 --> 15:14.316
* Got a date with an angel

15:14.357 --> 15:17.326
* I'm on my way to heaven

15:19.362 --> 15:22.490
* Got a date with an angel

15:22.532 --> 15:25.000
* Gotta meet her at seven

15:25.835 --> 15:27.996
* Got a date with an angel

15:31.274 --> 15:33.174
* I'm on my way to heaven *

15:57.767 --> 16:00.429
Honolulu tower, chopper 9-5-Alpha,

16:01.070 --> 16:05.734
over the Valley of the Temples,
requesting clearance to the south ramp.

16:07.210 --> 16:11.146
<i>9-5-Alpha, hold over the valley.
We have a jumbo departing.</i>

16:11.180 --> 16:14.172
9-5-Alpha, roger.

16:17.387 --> 16:21.551
* So just remember Pearl Harbor

16:21.591 --> 16:25.186
* As we go to meet the foe... *

16:26.496 --> 16:29.988
<i>9-5-Alpha, you're cleared
to cross the parallels to the south ramp.</i>

16:30.032 --> 16:33.024
9-5-Alpha, roger.

16:43.112 --> 16:46.809
* Just remember Pearl Harbor

16:46.849 --> 16:49.909
* As we did the Alamo *

17:27.290 --> 17:29.690
Sorry. No more flights today.

17:29.725 --> 17:34.719
You think I'm going up in one of those jelly rolls
again after Nam, you are nuts, T.C.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.929
Nu <i>z</i> o?

17:39.836 --> 17:42.703
How many other gimps do you know?

17:49.045 --> 17:52.947
Sometimes I think
Thomas is still trying to get me killed.

17:52.982 --> 17:55.075
 You mean in the reserves?

17:55.117 --> 17:58.245
No, when Thomas deep-sixed the navy,
he went all the way.

17:58.287 --> 18:03.384
He uses me on some of his cases
as his private air taxi.

18:03.426 --> 18:06.224
Thomas Sullivan Magnum is a P. I.

18:06.262 --> 18:11.859
- Tom is a private eye?
- I think he prefers "private investigator".

18:11.901 --> 18:14.233
Well, I'll be damned.

18:18.241 --> 18:20.334
<i>O</i> h.

18:21.677 --> 18:23.668
Same old Nu <i>z</i> o.

18:25.681 --> 18:27.706
Still hooked on pogey bait.

18:27.750 --> 18:30.310
You got to admit
it beats the hell out of smoking.

18:30.353 --> 18:32.685
Yeah, I guess you're right.

18:34.690 --> 18:37.659
Remember when Saigon Sally
had a case of bubblegum

18:37.693 --> 18:41.151
and the only way we could pick it up
was in that shot-up Cobra?

18:41.197 --> 18:44.758
- Yeah, sorta.
- "Sorta"? We almost got killed.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.234
- No, the Cobra held up.
- No, not the Cobra.

18:47.270 --> 18:51.730
When we got out of Sally with all that gum,
the street kids in Saigon were chasing us.

18:51.774 --> 18:53.435
Yeah.

18:56.178 --> 19:00.012
It's the first time I been back here
since that R&R in '68.

19:01.317 --> 19:04.684
Funny, feels like the war
could still be going on.

19:06.556 --> 19:08.547
Yeah, it does kinda.

19:19.101 --> 19:21.797
Sorry, man,
I kinda drifted there for a moment.

19:21.837 --> 19:24.169
Just don't drift too far, <i>O</i> K?

19:28.377 --> 19:31.141
So what do you do for a living now?

19:31.180 --> 19:34.411
Still work for Uncle Sam.
Postal department, Washington D.C.

19:34.450 --> 19:37.681
Is that why my mail is always late?

19:37.720 --> 19:42.214
Can't lay that on me. I'm in computers.
Payroll and personnel.

19:43.326 --> 19:47.786
Look at that. Reminds me of
the artillery positions above Nha Trang.

19:47.830 --> 19:53.700
Yeah. Kinda. And that valley. That valley
reminds me of the one north of Quan Loi.

19:54.770 --> 19:56.761
Well, I'll be...

20:07.116 --> 20:09.175
- T.C.
- Uh-huh.

20:09.218 --> 20:11.914
I'm not here on no R&R.

20:11.954 --> 20:14.218
- He's after me.
- Who?

20:14.685 --> 20:15.674
Ivan.

21:12.428 --> 21:14.259
The last 100 meters was terrific.

21:17.267 --> 21:18.632
Yeah.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.033
Terrific.

21:21.104 --> 21:24.972
No, I mean it. If you could do that
all the way from Molokai, you might win,

21:25.008 --> 21:27.499
instead of finishing 87th.

21:30.113 --> 21:33.082
I looked up the finishing order
of last year's race,

21:33.116 --> 21:36.415
You came in behind
a 12-year-old girl from Kauai.

21:36.452 --> 21:37.680
Kiki Kahuna.

21:39.422 --> 21:43.620
- What do you want, Mac?
- I thought you might wanna win this year.

21:43.660 --> 21:47.357
<i>- O</i> r at least beat a 12-year-old girl.
- She's 13 by now.

21:48.865 --> 21:53.825
Magnum, I'm serious. Every competitor
has his strengths and weaknesses.

21:53.870 --> 21:56.338
You'd probably do better
with a following sea.

21:56.372 --> 22:00.832
- Everyone does better with a following sea.
- Well, you know what I mean.

22:00.877 --> 22:03.846
Well, I prefer big swells, the long rollers.

22:03.880 --> 22:06.781
Some guys prefer short rollers,
some even like chop.

22:06.816 --> 22:10.149
- Now you're getting the idea.
- But I don't see what...

22:10.186 --> 22:14.555
Magnum, look, the Molokai <i>- O</i> ahu race
is a pretty small club.

22:14.591 --> 22:16.855
You probably know just about everyone in it.

22:17.894 --> 22:18.918
So?

22:18.962 --> 22:21.590
So you give me
their strengths and weaknesses.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.326
I plug them into a computer,

22:23.366 --> 22:29.168
cross-reference that with the wind and tide
conditions in the channel and plug you in.

22:30.340 --> 22:32.331
- Me?
- Right.

22:32.375 --> 22:34.969
I study you on this baby under all conditions,

22:35.011 --> 22:37.980
right down to variations
in air and water temperatures.

22:38.014 --> 22:42.007
And then I compare you
to the top ten finishers in last year's race.

22:42.051 --> 22:45.214
This year's race, I plug in
the weather conditions and bingo.

22:45.254 --> 22:46.778
Bingo?

22:46.823 --> 22:48.256
We get the answer.

22:48.291 --> 22:49.724
What answer?

22:51.060 --> 22:55.690
Which entrants most likely to finish
in the top ten have your racing style?

22:55.732 --> 23:00.567
Then you follow 'em, use them as an incentive,
like greyhounds chasing a rabbit.

23:00.603 --> 23:03.197
The rabbit always wins.

23:04.107 --> 23:05.597
I can't perform miracles.

23:08.344 --> 23:10.175
You know, it might just work.

23:10.213 --> 23:12.443
<i>O</i> f course it'll work.

23:12.482 --> 23:17.715
All I need is time with you over the next couple
of days and access to a computer.

23:18.721 --> 23:21.019
What's wrong with your navy computer?

23:22.892 --> 23:25.759
I resigned from the navy this morning.

23:32.101 --> 23:34.968
Memories sometimes get kinda real.

23:35.004 --> 23:38.599
I know guys who have
dug foxholes in their backyard.

23:38.641 --> 23:42.008
I am not suffering from delayed stress.

23:42.045 --> 23:45.412
T.C., until a week ago,
I never thought about Nam.

23:46.916 --> 23:51.148
Well, hardly ever,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

23:52.555 --> 23:54.887
What would I have given for a steak
at Duc Hue?

23:54.924 --> 23:59.258
I would have settled for
a piece of beef jerky in that hole.

24:02.331 --> 24:04.822
Where d'you think you saw him?

24:07.136 --> 24:09.969
- Where'd you see him?
<i>- O</i> utside the Smithsonian.

24:10.006 --> 24:13.567
It's where I have my lunch.
It's good to watch the skirts wiggle by.

24:13.609 --> 24:19.809
Anyway, one day I'm out there eating
my liver and onion and Ivan just strolls by.

24:19.849 --> 24:24.309
- Just like that?
- Just like that. I didn't know what to do.

24:24.353 --> 24:26.082
Then I thought of you. Here I am.

24:29.492 --> 24:32.757
Maybe it was a coincidence,

24:32.795 --> 24:35.457
- someone who looked like Ivan.
- T.C.

24:37.900 --> 24:40.425
He was on the plane today.

24:40.470 --> 24:43.598
I didn't see him till I got off,
but there he was, it was him.

24:43.639 --> 24:47.473
- Man, it's been ten years. You can't be sure.
- Yes, I can.

24:47.510 --> 24:49.501
He smiled.

24:51.347 --> 24:53.679
Remember that smile?

24:53.716 --> 24:56.685
The one he always had...

24:56.719 --> 24:59.745
just before...
just before he wasted somebody?

25:10.500 --> 25:14.027
Well, it is quite simple.

25:15.438 --> 25:18.498
You sign the admission of guilt

25:18.541 --> 25:21.635
and you'll be let out of your cages,

25:21.677 --> 25:23.975
given a hot shower,

25:24.013 --> 25:25.844
hot food,

25:26.682 --> 25:32.814
and a bed with cool, clean sheets, huh?

25:34.590 --> 25:36.080
Just like Howard Johnson.

25:41.030 --> 25:43.897
Who is this Howard Johnson?

25:45.735 --> 25:48.602
- Head of the NAACP.
- T.C.

26:01.551 --> 26:03.519
<i>O</i> h, man, one of us has had it now.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.951
Not if we keep our heads.

26:11.661 --> 26:15.757
You are three months at Duc Hue
and still you are cracking jokes.

26:17.733 --> 26:20.361
Are you what is called a tough nigger?

26:27.577 --> 26:29.807
Is that what you are, boy?

26:31.914 --> 26:33.404
You got it, honky.

26:49.765 --> 26:51.926
You're wasting your time. He can't write.

26:53.402 --> 26:55.302
I mean it, he can't read either.

26:55.338 --> 26:59.468
- Shut up.
- T.C., don't worry about it, it's not your fault.

26:59.508 --> 27:03.604
He was raised in this ghetto with no father
and his mother wasn't around.

27:03.646 --> 27:06.809
I'm warning you, you redneck,
shut up, cos I'll kill you!

27:06.849 --> 27:08.783
You and who else, jungle bunny?

27:11.654 --> 27:14.122
Let me outta here!

27:14.156 --> 27:17.717
I'm not gonna stay here and die.
Let me outta here! I'll sign it.

27:23.065 --> 27:26.865
Would you two like to settle
your differences out here?

27:26.903 --> 27:28.894
- Yeah.
- Right on.

27:33.409 --> 27:35.172
You think that I am stupid?

27:37.513 --> 27:40.812
Your little theatrical improvisation

27:40.850 --> 27:43.410
might fool my comrades, but not me.

27:44.654 --> 27:47.782
It is a stupid schoolboy trick.

28:18.888 --> 28:22.551
- Stay cool, Cookie. Just stay cool.
- T.C.

28:22.591 --> 28:25.287
He's gonna do it.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.762
No, Ivan. No, I'll sign the papers.

28:28.764 --> 28:32.063
- You can't do that, T.C.
- He's my gunner, man.

28:32.101 --> 28:36.094
I'll sign the papers,
I'll do a broadcast, anything you want.

29:01.998 --> 29:04.125
You shot him in the femoral artery.

29:04.166 --> 29:08.068
- Plug it with your finger!
- Put your finger in it, Cookie.

29:08.104 --> 29:11.198
I can't reach it! I'm gonna die!

29:11.807 --> 29:12.865
Nigger.

29:15.344 --> 29:20.213
I could care less whether or not
you ever sign propaganda papers.

29:37.800 --> 29:41.827
He's come here to waste me, T.C.
I know that. He's come here to waste me.

29:44.774 --> 29:46.765
No, man.

29:47.777 --> 29:49.870
If Ivan's here,

29:49.912 --> 29:52.005
he came to get wasted.

30:00.405 --> 30:03.670
<i>I offered to put Mac up
until he found a place of his own.</i>

30:03.708 --> 30:07.200
<i>I even picked up
his favorite food for dinner.</i>

30:09.247 --> 30:12.444
<i>Mac not eating
was like Joe Louis not fighting,</i>

30:12.483 --> 30:16.715
<i>or Pete Rose giving up baseball
or Connors quitting tennis or...</i>

30:16.754 --> 30:18.585
<i>You get the idea.</i>

30:18.623 --> 30:22.457
<i>Not even my tape of Stalag 17
could cheer him up.</i>

30:23.328 --> 30:25.796
<i>They're past the 50-yard line.</i>

30:25.830 --> 30:27.798
<i>Look at 'em go.</i>

30:34.005 --> 30:36.872
- Great movie, huh?
- Yeah.

30:42.513 --> 30:46.040
<i>O</i> K, Mac, wanna tell me
why you resigned?

30:56.794 --> 30:59.092
Where are you going?

30:59.130 --> 31:00.995
I got a date.

31:01.032 --> 31:03.000
You mind if I tag along?

31:04.335 --> 31:06.565
Are you serious? <i>O</i> n a date?

31:06.604 --> 31:09.732
I don't wanna be alone tonight,
if you know what I mean.

31:11.542 --> 31:15.103
Mac, I don't mind
sharing my place with you,

31:15.146 --> 31:18.843
or my food,
or a tape of my favorite movie.

31:18.883 --> 31:20.874
But when it comes to a date...

31:23.187 --> 31:24.848
I understand.

31:37.402 --> 31:39.393
It's not gonna work, you know.

31:40.171 --> 31:43.698
- What?
- The lost-puppy look. It is not going to work.

31:43.741 --> 31:48.735
I have a date tonight with Julie
and I am going to keep it, alone.

31:51.482 --> 31:55.816
Julie, you'll love this place. Mac says
they have the greatest hula dancers.

31:55.853 --> 32:00.256
Hula dancing? We were going to a concert.
Now we're going to see hula dancing.

32:00.291 --> 32:04.751
- You don't like hula dancing?
- Me, not like a little native culture?

32:04.796 --> 32:06.787
Are you kidding?

32:19.577 --> 32:21.875
When was this taken?

32:21.913 --> 32:25.144
'68. It was Cookie's birthday.

32:25.183 --> 32:27.515
He bought the farm a week after that.

32:27.552 --> 32:30.180
- How old was he?
- 24.

32:34.158 --> 32:36.149
Why is Ivan after you?

32:37.328 --> 32:39.762
- I don't know.
- It don't make sense.

32:39.797 --> 32:43.733
When did anything Ivan do make sense?
That was the scary thing about him.

32:43.768 --> 32:46.396
He just did. There was no reason.
He just did.

32:51.008 --> 32:54.034
Maybe you oughta call the cops, the F.B. I.

32:54.078 --> 32:58.777
Tell 'em what? A Soviet officer who wasted
our P <i>.O.</i> W.s in Nam is here to waste me?

32:58.816 --> 33:01.512
They'd look at me the same way you did
when I told you.

33:01.552 --> 33:04.851
But they weren't there, T.C.,
They didn't know Ivan.

33:04.889 --> 33:07.983
They'd throw me
in some section-eight ward of the hospital.

33:08.025 --> 33:10.186
And he would find me there.

33:12.530 --> 33:16.660
Damn. Can't never find Thomas
when you need him.

33:16.701 --> 33:19.670
Can't you leave a message
with his service?

33:19.704 --> 33:21.763
I've been trying to avoid that.

33:21.806 --> 33:25.435
- Why?
- You don't know his service.

33:37.655 --> 33:40.954
- Robin Masters' estate.
- Evening, Higgie baby.

33:42.593 --> 33:46.962
- Good God! You have incredible gall.
- Higgie, I know you're a little perturbed.

33:46.998 --> 33:50.490
- A little? A little?
<i>- There's that echo again.</i>

33:50.535 --> 33:53.333
You have no concept of the depth of my ire.

33:53.371 --> 33:56.101
<i>- Higgie.</i>
- And stop calling me Higgie.

33:56.140 --> 33:58.700
I don't permit my own mother
to call me Higgie.

33:58.743 --> 34:00.768
Ten seconds, just give me ten seconds,

34:00.812 --> 34:06.478
and I... I promise I'll never land
on the estate again without your permission.

34:06.517 --> 34:09.918
That is my word of honor
as an officer and a gentleman.

34:12.023 --> 34:14.821
- You have ten seconds. Mark.
- Mark?

34:14.859 --> 34:16.382
<i>Nine seconds.</i>

34:16.427 --> 34:22.491
It's important... It's important that I get in touch
with Thomas. Life-or-death important.

34:22.533 --> 34:26.264
<i>- Have any idea where I can find him?</i>
- No. Five seconds.

34:26.304 --> 34:27.429
Higgie.

34:27.472 --> 34:29.565
I mean, Higgins.

34:29.607 --> 34:31.666
Higgins, please.

34:32.210 --> 34:34.440
<i>You must at least have an idea.</i>

34:34.478 --> 34:38.643
Your ten seconds are up,
however I am not a man without heart.

34:38.683 --> 34:42.380
He left here with Lieutenant MacReynolds
about seven.

34:42.420 --> 34:45.286
<i>- With Mac?</i>
- And while I have no idea where they went,

34:45.322 --> 34:50.317
knowing the two of them, try some strip joint
with a name like the Boom-Boom Room.

35:39.844 --> 35:42.039
What'd I tell you? Wasn't that terrific?

35:42.079 --> 35:43.740
Terrific.

35:47.318 --> 35:51.516
- Where's the drink?
<i>- O</i> h, the pineapple absorbs the liquor.

35:51.556 --> 35:54.457
That's why you can get higher than hell
eating the fruit.

35:54.492 --> 35:57.484
Right now
I need to get higher than hell.

35:58.362 --> 36:00.023
I'm starved.

36:01.098 --> 36:04.465
Boy, I'll bet the food here is wonderful.

36:04.502 --> 36:06.094
<i>O</i> utstanding.

36:06.137 --> 36:11.973
Julie, some of the best food in the islands
is served in authentic little spots like this.

36:12.009 --> 36:15.604
- Authentic?
- Miss, may I have a menu?

36:15.646 --> 36:18.206
You don't need a menu here.
This is Luau Louie's.

36:18.249 --> 36:21.810
Maybe you don't know
what they're famous for.

36:21.852 --> 36:24.650
- I'm afraid to ask.
- Mahimahi?

36:26.023 --> 36:27.490
<i>O</i> no?

36:28.526 --> 36:30.187
<i>O</i> pakapaka?

36:30.895 --> 36:33.227
Barbecue pork and poi.

36:33.264 --> 36:35.255
<i>O</i> f course.

36:36.200 --> 36:40.694
Aloha, aloha, aloha.

36:41.706 --> 36:45.938
Which means in the islands
how-a-ya, how-a-ya, how-a-ya.

36:46.944 --> 36:50.141
Hey, we'd like to welcome
all you mainlanders

36:50.181 --> 36:54.277
to Luau Louie's Authentic
All-Hawaiian Revue.

36:54.318 --> 36:58.414
Remember, if you like the show,
tell your friends back home.

36:58.456 --> 37:03.189
If you didn't like the show,
keep your haole mouth shut.

37:03.227 --> 37:05.422
Little Polynesian humor.

37:05.463 --> 37:08.193
And now what you've been waiting for
all night long.

37:08.232 --> 37:11.258
Folks, here's your chance to go native,

37:11.302 --> 37:16.672
because now it's time
for the hula-hula contest.

37:16.707 --> 37:17.935
Come on, girls.

37:28.052 --> 37:30.145
No, thanks. We'll just watch.

37:30.187 --> 37:33.953
Ho, ho. Come on, Thomas,
I thought you loved hula dancing.

37:33.991 --> 37:36.482
- Go for it, you two.
- Are you serious?

37:36.527 --> 37:38.154
Dead serious.

37:40.197 --> 37:42.188
Come on.

37:42.233 --> 37:43.894
Thomas.

37:46.537 --> 37:49.529
- I don't wanna do this.
- You dance, Thomas.

38:01.952 --> 38:03.385
I don't wanna do this.

38:50.468 --> 38:52.402
Ginger, telephone.

38:54.672 --> 38:56.833
Scotch on the rocks.

38:58.876 --> 39:01.572
Who's the wahine?

39:01.612 --> 39:04.945
Name's Julie Barbara,
she's a lawyer for Interlsland Shipping.

39:04.982 --> 39:07.780
- Sexy.
- She's nice.

39:07.818 --> 39:12.084
- Look, Colonel, I don't like this.
- Didn't expect you would.

39:12.123 --> 39:15.286
- I've been thinking.
- Dangerous, Mac. Let me do that.

39:17.762 --> 39:19.923
Thanks.

39:19.964 --> 39:21.989
Why don't we just tell him?

39:23.067 --> 39:25.399
He's a civilian.

39:25.436 --> 39:28.803
This is a military operation.

39:28.839 --> 39:32.707
Besides, I learned a long time ago
that if you tell Magnum what's going on,

39:32.743 --> 39:35.439
you'll end up with
egg foo yong on your face.

39:35.479 --> 39:38.778
And you know how I hate Chinese food.

39:38.816 --> 39:41.649
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

39:41.685 --> 39:44.449
It'll be over by Sunday. That much I know.

39:45.723 --> 39:47.714
Anything yet?

39:51.061 --> 39:52.892
- Poor guy.
- Who?

39:52.930 --> 39:57.890
Magnum. With a woman like that,
I wouldn't want you bunking over tonight.

40:35.873 --> 40:37.864
Hula-hula was sensational.

40:37.908 --> 40:40.809
I go there for the pineapple drinks
and the hula.

40:40.845 --> 40:43.871
I told you it's fun.
Didn't I tell you it was fun?

40:43.914 --> 40:46.109
- Terrific.
- Yeah, it's terrific.

40:46.150 --> 40:48.744
<i>O</i> h, do I detect a bit of insincerity
in your voice?

40:48.786 --> 40:51.186
- What? You really...
- Enjoyed myself?

40:51.222 --> 40:53.554
- Yeah.
- I thought that was the idea.

40:53.591 --> 40:56.458
You didn't have to
enjoy yourself that much.

40:56.493 --> 41:00.953
Why don't I drive home? I think she ought
to sit on your lap on the drive back.

41:03.901 --> 41:05.562
Ah.

41:07.204 --> 41:09.399
Are you jealous?

41:09.440 --> 41:11.431
Me? Jealous?

41:14.144 --> 41:15.509
Well...

41:16.680 --> 41:19.080
Maybe a little bit around the edges.

41:20.117 --> 41:21.516
Oh.

41:21.552 --> 41:27.115
You know, Mac was right.
It was tourist and crass and hokey.

41:29.593 --> 41:31.151
And fun?

41:32.229 --> 41:33.457
And fun.

41:34.515 --> 41:39.086
Hey, what do you say we drive up
to Pali Lookout and watch the sunrise?

41:39.305 --> 41:41.391
It oughta be beautiful.

42:31.504 --> 42:33.836
<i>Dr Harris, I.C.U. stat.</i>

42:38.311 --> 42:40.871
<i>Janet Feltzer, Seven West, Pathology.</i>

42:40.914 --> 42:44.941
- So you'll be seven on your next birthday?
- Lieutenant MacReynolds?

42:44.984 --> 42:47.248
- He's in Trauma.
- Where's Trauma?

42:47.287 --> 42:48.777
Through those doors.

42:49.856 --> 42:52.347
Hey, you can't go in there.

43:04.637 --> 43:08.300
<i>Dr Kahaloa, Trauma Unit B.
Kahaloa, T. Unit B.</i>

43:24.524 --> 43:26.492
Why?

43:31.197 --> 43:32.858
Why?

43:34.267 --> 43:36.758
I don't know what you're talking about.

43:36.803 --> 43:39.966
I got a call Mac was in an accident.

43:40.006 --> 43:42.474
I didn't even know you were involved.

43:43.476 --> 43:45.239
<i>Tech staff, Terminal One.</i>

43:47.313 --> 43:50.544
He was a hell of a nice guy.

43:50.583 --> 43:52.983
Maybe too nice for the kind of work
he chose.

43:55.155 --> 43:59.091
Now you listen, Colonel,
and you listen good.

44:00.360 --> 44:03.818
Somehow you're involved in this.
I knew it when you walked in.

44:03.863 --> 44:05.854
Now I wanna know why.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.730
You're in shock, Magnum, and you're hurt.

44:09.769 --> 44:12.761
- Don't make me defend myself...
- Why?

44:15.341 --> 44:17.206
You tell me.

44:17.243 --> 44:19.074
It was your car.

44:35.695 --> 44:37.686
That's it, isn't it?

44:38.698 --> 44:43.397
You wanna lay it on me
because you're afraid Mac took your packet.

44:45.071 --> 44:47.062
Hell, I don't blame you,

44:47.106 --> 44:49.097
but you're wrong.

45:18.671 --> 45:20.332
I'm sorry, Mac.

45:24.277 --> 45:26.268
I'm sorry.

45:33.617 --> 45:34.808
Hey, Rick.

45:36.290 --> 45:38.018
What's the odds on Duke Kamani?

45:38.055 --> 45:40.421
- 20-1.
- 20-1? You gotta be kidding.

45:40.458 --> 45:43.450
Duke's a great surf skier,
but he's nearly 63.

45:43.494 --> 45:46.486
63? I thought he was closer to 70.

45:47.865 --> 45:50.197
- 15-1
- What?

45:50.234 --> 45:53.226
What are you giving on Three-Toed Tony?

45:56.440 --> 46:01.377
Ah. Sure, Mr. Rick. Anything you want.
<i>O</i> pakapaka with grape leaves. You got it.

46:01.412 --> 46:03.903
- What are you babbling about?
- I cook anything.

46:03.948 --> 46:05.813
All right. Here, I got it. 80-1.

46:09.620 --> 46:13.147
You wouldn't be accepting wagers
for next week's race, would you?

46:13.190 --> 46:17.786
Wagers? Me? You gotta be kidding.
That's against club policy.

46:17.828 --> 46:20.388
"Herky Moslick, 15-1."

46:20.431 --> 46:22.763
"Jay Lee, 7-1."

46:26.037 --> 46:29.996
- "Magnum, 100-1."
- It's not what you think.

46:30.041 --> 46:32.532
- It's not?
- No, it's um...

46:32.576 --> 46:36.512
Well, it's my new system to keep tabs
on delinquent accounts, you see...

46:36.547 --> 46:39.107
The first number shows
the amount owed.

46:39.150 --> 46:42.677
And the second number shows
the months that it's past due.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.347
<i>O</i> h.

46:44.388 --> 46:48.256
So Magnum has owed the club
$100 for one month?

46:48.292 --> 46:50.658
Yeah. You see how easy it is?

46:52.063 --> 46:55.590
This reminds me of the time I caught Magnum
on the household computer

46:55.633 --> 46:57.760
playing Dungeons and Dragons.

46:57.802 --> 47:01.169
He said he was computing
the shortest distance between the estate

47:01.205 --> 47:03.935
and various spots
he frequents around the island.

47:03.974 --> 47:07.842
He was doing this, he said,
to reduce wear and tear on the Ferrari.

47:07.878 --> 47:09.175
That is pathetic.

47:09.213 --> 47:12.410
It takes second place
to the story you just told me.

47:14.518 --> 47:19.114
<i>O</i> K, I gotta level with you, it is my book
on the surf ski race, but it's for a good cause.

47:20.057 --> 47:23.618
- What cause?
- The one you're president of.

47:23.661 --> 47:28.030
I'm president of many. The Hawaiian Society
for Underprivileged Children...

47:28.065 --> 47:33.264
That's the one. Underprivileged children.
I'm going to donate 50%%% of the profits to them.

47:33.304 --> 47:34.566
100%%%.

47:34.605 --> 47:35.867
75.

47:35.906 --> 47:39.239
100, and the board shall never learn

47:39.276 --> 47:43.440
that the manager of the King Kamehameha
Club was taking wages for personal profit.

47:47.518 --> 47:51.215
- Where's Magnum?
- He's probably out practicing for the race.

47:51.255 --> 47:55.851
I doubt it. He and MacReynolds weren't back
from their toot on the town when I left.

47:55.893 --> 47:58.691
- Damn!
- What's wrong?

47:58.729 --> 48:00.390
Hey, man, you remember Nu <i>z</i> o?

48:00.431 --> 48:03.730
Didn't he run a floating crap game
out the south side of Chicago?

48:03.767 --> 48:06.964
No, man. He was with us
in Duc Hue when we escaped.

48:07.004 --> 48:10.804
T.C., you guys did that
before I joined the team, remember?

48:10.841 --> 48:14.971
I replaced the gunner
that bought it on that mission. Um...

48:17.047 --> 48:19.038
Cookie.

48:20.784 --> 48:23.184
How in the hell could I forget that?

48:23.220 --> 48:25.848
- T.C., are you all right?
- Yeah.

48:25.890 --> 48:27.551
Yeah.

48:28.025 --> 48:31.688
Just gotta find Magnum, you know.
Just gotta find him.

48:33.497 --> 48:36.432
<i>It had been a typical sunrise in paradise.</i>

48:36.467 --> 48:39.664
<i>Beautiful. Breathtakingly beautiful.</i>

48:40.671 --> 48:45.005
<i>I wish Mac could be around to see it, I wish
Mac could be around to do a lot of things,</i>

48:45.042 --> 48:49.536
<i>but he wasn't,
and somehow it was my fault.</i>

48:49.580 --> 48:51.980
<i>I was finding that hard to live with.</i>

48:53.317 --> 48:55.717
<i>Mac was one of the good guys.</i>

48:55.753 --> 48:57.914
<i>A white hat.</i>

48:57.955 --> 49:00.981
<i>A buddy you could always count on.</i>

49:01.025 --> 49:04.517
<i>Even if it took a little persuading
now and then.</i>

49:05.396 --> 49:09.628
Thomas, this is your worst one yet.
I mean it, this is the worst.

49:09.667 --> 49:15.936
To think you could get information out of me
by conning me with jelly rolls, an éclair.

49:15.973 --> 49:20.137
These are jelly-filled too.
And these éclairs, they're just great.

49:21.879 --> 49:24.939
That's so dumb. Besides, I'm on a diet.

49:25.783 --> 49:29.275
- Magnum, you're conning me.
- If that's what you want to think, fine.

49:29.954 --> 49:33.720
- It's not a problem.
- M-M-Magnum, come back.

49:35.926 --> 49:38.190
I know you're conning me.

49:38.229 --> 49:41.687
<i>O</i> h, so that's the reason for
the two scoops of chocolate,

49:41.732 --> 49:43.723
and butterscotch and the nuts?

49:43.767 --> 49:47.203
- That's great. There's banana in there.
- Cherries...

49:47.238 --> 49:49.206
- Cherries?
- What do you want from me?

49:49.240 --> 49:51.231
- Me? Want?
- Yeah, want.

49:52.676 --> 49:57.010
<i>I always wanted something, and after a little
protesting, Mac always came through.</i>

49:57.047 --> 49:59.015
<i>Always.</i>

49:59.049 --> 50:01.176
<i>Even when Buck Greene was around.</i>

50:02.319 --> 50:05.220
I don't know how and I don't know why,

50:05.256 --> 50:08.919
but Michelle's alive and here,
and you're mixed up in it, you're the key.

50:08.959 --> 50:10.950
And I'm gonna find her.

50:10.995 --> 50:14.556
I don't care if I have to blow
the lid off whatever your operation is,

50:14.598 --> 50:17.692
and no matter who it hurts, and I mean it.

50:20.237 --> 50:23.968
- You think he means it, Mac?
- Yes, sir, I do.

50:28.812 --> 50:31.975
Good Lord. What happened?

50:40.524 --> 50:43.857
I'm sorry, Higgins.
I'm afraid the Ferrari's totaled.

50:47.197 --> 50:50.223
- It wasn't an accident?
- No, sir. It was a bomb.

50:50.267 --> 50:53.634
- Are you certain?
- Yes, sir.

50:53.671 --> 50:56.105
Why in God's name
would they wanna kill him?

50:56.140 --> 50:58.904
I don't know, sir. I didn't expect it.

50:58.942 --> 51:00.705
It's my error.

51:00.744 --> 51:03.235
I'll be more careful in the future.

51:04.048 --> 51:07.074
Perhaps we should bring Magnum in
for his own protection.

51:07.117 --> 51:11.213
I wouldn't do that, sir. If we pull him in,
they'll know we're onto something.

51:11.255 --> 51:14.588
- Besides, I don't know where he is.
- What?

51:14.625 --> 51:17.150
Don't worry, sir. I'll find him.

51:17.194 --> 51:19.754
Whatever they're up to,
Magnum's a part of it.

51:19.797 --> 51:22.789
I have no intention of losing him now.

51:41.085 --> 51:45.283
- You served with Magnum in Nam?
- Yes, sir.

51:45.322 --> 51:49.554
And you mothered his former wife
as an agent?

51:49.593 --> 51:51.584
Michelle. Yes, sir.

51:52.796 --> 51:54.787
She's still in Vietnam.

51:55.766 --> 51:58.792
She's married to one of their generals.

51:59.636 --> 52:03.003
Magnum must really hate you.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.132
Yes, sir.

52:05.242 --> 52:09.736
I believe he does. Probably always will.

52:09.780 --> 52:11.441
Ten'hun!

52:12.082 --> 52:14.642
Don't be too sure.

52:14.685 --> 52:19.088
Even the most hated enemies
have ways of becoming friends,

52:19.123 --> 52:21.114
in time.

52:38.375 --> 52:43.711
They said Julie would be in the hospital
a couple of days for observation.

52:43.747 --> 52:47.012
They must have wanted
to keep you there too.

52:47.050 --> 52:50.679
I don't know.
I'm not even sure how I got home.

52:50.721 --> 52:53.053
You obviously walked, old boy.

52:53.090 --> 52:55.923
12 miles, at least.

52:59.263 --> 53:02.528
So this is what you were doing
with the matchsticks.

53:02.566 --> 53:04.557
Yes.

53:07.171 --> 53:11.232
- Do you know what it is?
- I killed him, Higgins.

53:11.275 --> 53:14.039
- I killed Mac.
- That's pure nonsense.

53:14.878 --> 53:19.872
Someone tried to kill you,
and Mac, unfortunately, got in the way.

53:22.519 --> 53:24.987
It happened to me once.

53:25.022 --> 53:27.513
In Burma, during the war.

53:29.642 --> 53:32.304
Any idea who would want to kill you?

53:34.118 --> 53:35.541
No.

53:39.770 --> 53:41.761
Ivan.

53:48.243 --> 53:50.939
I haven't had a headache like this
since Duc Hue.

53:50.979 --> 53:54.642
Would you give me that aspirin bottle
in the glove compartment?

54:01.223 --> 54:05.785
T.C., you're only supposed to
carry this on a military assignment.

54:05.827 --> 54:08.660
- I ain't taking no chances.
- T.C.!

54:08.697 --> 54:11.791
And I don't need no lectures, either.

54:12.701 --> 54:14.692
I'm sorry, man.

54:16.371 --> 54:19.363
It's just that he's here.
I can feel him, just like in Nam.

54:19.407 --> 54:22.570
Remember that itch I used to get
just before an L.Z. got lit up?

54:22.611 --> 54:23.669
Yeah.

54:23.712 --> 54:27.045
Man, I've had that same itch
ever since I picked up Nu <i>z</i> o.

54:27.082 --> 54:29.846
Ivan's here, man, and I'm gonna waste him.

54:33.421 --> 54:35.184
There's a tan sedan following us.

54:36.291 --> 54:37.588
You sure?

54:37.626 --> 54:40.823
Been on our butt since we left Robin's Nest.

54:40.862 --> 54:42.853
Hang on.

54:53.842 --> 54:55.173
Satisfied?

54:58.013 --> 55:00.880
- Take the next side road.
- Don't go nowhere.

55:00.916 --> 55:04.875
Just doubles around behind
an old abandoned gun emplacement.

55:04.920 --> 55:06.751
Even better.

55:16.932 --> 55:19.366
- Don't say it.
- Say what?

55:19.401 --> 55:22.302
- You know what.
- That you're acting paranoid?

55:22.337 --> 55:24.828
I asked you not to say it.

55:40.488 --> 55:42.149
<i>* And I try</i>

55:42.190 --> 55:43.851

<i>O</i> h, man.

57:29.831 --> 57:31.992
Am I glad to see you!

57:34.402 --> 57:35.699
Agh.

57:35.737 --> 57:37.329
Sorry. Sorry.

57:38.006 --> 57:39.701
You look good.

57:39.741 --> 57:41.436
You look the same as ever.

57:46.448 --> 57:49.144
For you, for you.

57:56.024 --> 57:58.458
Like old times.

58:00.995 --> 58:05.694
Give you guys a couple of days,
you'll have this place looking like a hooch.

58:05.734 --> 58:07.429
And armed like one.

58:08.203 --> 58:10.364
It's a good thing T.C.'s in the reserves.

58:10.405 --> 58:13.101
Damn. I forgot to call
and change my weekend duty.

58:13.141 --> 58:16.838
Don't do that, T.C. You got a mission to fly.
Don't didi out because of me.

58:16.878 --> 58:19.779
I got a mission here, to waste Ivan.

58:19.814 --> 58:23.477
What are you talking about?
You don't know Ivan's within 10,000 miles.

58:23.518 --> 58:26.578
What does it take to convince you, Thomas?
He wasted Mac.

58:29.424 --> 58:31.085
Hold the call, T.C.

58:32.794 --> 58:34.557
That's an order.

58:41.236 --> 58:43.227
I think I need more aspirin.

58:56.251 --> 59:00.153
- Sorry to hear about your buddy.
- Thanks.

59:00.188 --> 59:02.918
- Did I know him in Nam?
- He wasn't in Nam.

59:08.730 --> 59:11.722
I guess you think I'm dinky dau, right?

59:13.168 --> 59:14.795
Ah.

59:14.869 --> 59:18.464
- I didn't say that.
- But you were thinking it.

59:20.475 --> 59:23.035
Well, Nu <i>z</i> o, the thought did cross my mind.

59:23.077 --> 59:26.877
Maybe you're right,
but if that wasn't Ivan in D.C., it was his twin.

59:26.915 --> 59:29.816
All right, then why is he here after you?

59:29.851 --> 59:33.014
Us. He is after us.
We diddy-bopped our butts out of there,

59:33.054 --> 59:35.022
we're the only ones that ever did.

59:35.056 --> 59:39.049
- Maybe he's trying to clean his record.
<i>- O</i> h, come on, Nu <i>z</i> o.

59:41.930 --> 59:43.727
T.C., did you see that slick?

59:43.765 --> 59:47.166
- What slick?
- It came up the valley same time as you.

59:47.202 --> 59:51.002
They do it all the time. Army Cobras crossing
Kolekole Pass to Wheeler.

59:52.574 --> 59:56.340
Same path the Japanese took in '41
when they bombed Pearl.

59:59.013 --> 01:00:01.277
But it wasn't no Cobra. It was a 58.

01:00:01.316 --> 01:00:04.945
T.C., you said the marines
are on maneuvers with the Guard.

01:00:04.986 --> 01:00:06.977
We are.

01:00:10.391 --> 01:00:15.385
Most of our birds should be
at K-Bay or Kahoolawe.

01:00:18.433 --> 01:00:20.424
Maybe you weren't paranoid after all.

01:00:58.139 --> 01:00:59.970
- Nothing, sir.
- Maggie.

01:01:02.176 --> 01:01:06.044
Whoever he is, he served with them.
I'll bet my birds on it.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.641
- And it was in Nam.
- I don't disagree, Colonel.

01:01:09.684 --> 01:01:13.950
But 2, 150,000 marines, sailors,
soldiers and airmen

01:01:13.988 --> 01:01:18.448
served in Vietnam between
March 1965 and January 1973.

01:01:18.493 --> 01:01:22.395
- Even limiting our search to...
- You just make that up?

01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:24.557
No, sir. To the best of my knowledge,

01:01:24.599 --> 01:01:27.898
that's the number of military personnel
who served in Vietnam.

01:01:27.936 --> 01:01:32.430
There were also 350,000 civilians there
under government contract.

01:01:32.473 --> 01:01:36.204
Maggie, you're ama <i>z</i> ing.

01:01:36.244 --> 01:01:38.872
As I was saying, Colonel,
even limiting our search

01:01:38.913 --> 01:01:43.441
to units that had possible contact
with Thomas Magnum or Theodore Calvin

01:01:43.484 --> 01:01:46.851
would mean comparing
100,000 photos to this.

01:01:46.888 --> 01:01:50.380
And it has been over ten years.
Individuals change.

01:01:50.425 --> 01:01:54.418
He was with 'em.
And he's not here on any R&R.

01:01:56.464 --> 01:02:01.993
Take a look. You'd think they were
going out on a search-and-destroy.

01:02:02.036 --> 01:02:04.197
Maybe they are.

01:02:05.306 --> 01:02:08.298
Yeah. But why?

01:02:08.343 --> 01:02:10.334
And after who?

01:02:10.378 --> 01:02:13.245
And what's the connection to the Russians?

01:02:15.316 --> 01:02:17.784
I got a feeling we'll know

01:02:17.819 --> 01:02:20.652
when we get a make on our friend here.

01:02:20.688 --> 01:02:24.317
Colonel, why don't we just have Five <i>- O</i>
stop him next time he moves,

01:02:24.359 --> 01:02:27.328
do a routine license check?

01:02:27.362 --> 01:02:30.024
You got a lot to learn, kid.

01:02:30.064 --> 01:02:33.124
First, never involve the locals,

01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:37.194
unless you want your mission known
from one end of the island to another.

01:02:37.238 --> 01:02:40.571
Second, don't let your connection
to the other side

01:02:40.608 --> 01:02:42.599
know what's going on.

01:02:43.444 --> 01:02:46.106
Even if that connection
is a possible target, sir?

01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:51.944
Especially if that connection
is a possible target, Maggie.

01:02:57.558 --> 01:02:59.788
Bring me back the files on Duc Hue.

01:03:08.636 --> 01:03:11.867
- Colonel Greene.
- Colonel, I have a tap on the line.

01:03:11.906 --> 01:03:16.036
- Patch it in here.
- Already done. It's into the main computers.

01:03:16.077 --> 01:03:18.068
Any calls on their line...

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:21.471
Hold on a minute, sir.

01:03:32.727 --> 01:03:34.888
- They're leaving.
<i>- All of them?</i>

01:03:34.929 --> 01:03:37.022
- Yes, in the van.
- Alert the others.

01:03:37.065 --> 01:03:39.056
I'll be airborne in three minutes.

01:03:41.502 --> 01:03:45.495
- They're on the move. I'll be in the chopper.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:03:48.142 --> 01:03:49.541
Male chauvinist...

01:03:52.046 --> 01:03:56.005
<i>Maybe I didn't wanna face the fact
I might be responsible for Mac's death.</i>

01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:59.451
<i>Maybe I was getting as paranoid
as T.C. and Nuzo.</i>

01:03:59.487 --> 01:04:02.422
<i>Maybe it was delayed stress
and I didn't even know it.</i>

01:04:02.457 --> 01:04:05.790
<i>Whatever it was,
I prayed that slick that went up the valley</i>

01:04:05.827 --> 01:04:07.727
<i>had one Colonel Buck Greene in it.</i>

01:04:07.762 --> 01:04:11.892
<i>Cos if it did, everything Nuzo said was true.</i>

01:04:11.933 --> 01:04:14.401
<i>Ivan was out there somewhere.</i>

01:04:14.435 --> 01:04:18.269
<i>All I had to do
was shake Buck to go after him.</i>

01:04:18.306 --> 01:04:21.605
- Round the next bend.
- We'll rende <i>z</i> vous at 2200.

01:04:21.642 --> 01:04:23.041
Roger.

01:04:30.685 --> 01:04:32.676
Get ready.

01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:43.761
Go.

01:04:51.806 --> 01:04:54.798
 Magnum was right. We got a tail.

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:25.512
- See him?
- No, he didn't come round the last turn.

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:27.886
- Check topside.
- Roger.

01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:35.597
We're all clear. We are home free, man.

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:40.125
If I'd known it was gonna be this easy,
Thomas could have stayed in with us.

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:47.338
Don't worry about being spotted.
Get us there, fast.

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:21.440
Don't move. He's gotta think you're dead,
you understand?

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:24.002
- Yeah.
- Can you cut loose?

01:06:24.046 --> 01:06:27.482
- I don't know.
- You gotta do it. Cut loose and drop.

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:29.347
<i>- O</i> n three.
- Got it.

01:06:32.955 --> 01:06:35.321
<i>O</i> ne, two...

01:06:37.092 --> 01:06:38.389
three.

01:06:44.933 --> 01:06:46.924
You all right?

01:07:00.582 --> 01:07:02.573
It's clean through.

01:07:20.102 --> 01:07:23.265
I guess it's time you and I had a little talk.

01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:33.242
All we know for sure
is it's called <i>O</i> peratsiya Vstrecha,

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:37.480
<i>O</i> peration Reunion, and it's on
for sometime this weekend.

01:07:37.519 --> 01:07:41.717
- Your name was tied to it.
- Why the hell didn't somebody tell me?

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:43.987
Lieutenant, close those blinds.

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:53.931
I didn't know they were gonna try
to kill you. I'm sorry.

01:07:53.969 --> 01:07:57.632
- Tell Mac you're sorry.
- Mac was a big boy.

01:07:57.673 --> 01:08:00.233
- He knew the risks.
- Like I did?

01:08:00.275 --> 01:08:03.176
- Take it easy.
- Don't tell me what to do, Admiral.

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:06.545
I'm not one of your boys anymore,
or girls.

01:08:13.455 --> 01:08:15.355
How'd you con Mac into it, Buck?

01:08:16.591 --> 01:08:19.788
He followed orders. No con.

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:22.819
That was your specialty with him.

01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:26.523
So that's how you do it?

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:32.206
Mac didn't wanna do it, Magnum.
He really didn't have a choice.

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:34.937
I'd be careful if I were you, Maggie.

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:39.037
You're liable to find that cute butt of yours
up on insubordination charges.

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:44.484
Now that's enough. If anyone is going
to press charges around here, it will be me.

01:08:46.154 --> 01:08:48.953
I have to attend a reception
for the Japanese prince.

01:08:49.524 --> 01:08:54.484
I'm not going to miss it because of some
teenage wrestling match between you two,

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:58.432
whether you are in the navy or not,
Mr. Magnum.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:02.031
- Now get on with it, Colonel.
- Yes, sir.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:11.176
Who is he?

01:09:12.247 --> 01:09:15.341
His name is Nu <i>z</i> o.
We were in Nam together.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.312
Why is he here?

01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:21.813
R&R.

01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:26.019
- I'm not buying it, Magnum.
- I'm not selling it, Buck.

01:09:28.596 --> 01:09:30.895
Where's Calvin?

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:34.225
I don't know where T.C. is.

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:38.770
You don't seem to know
much about anything, do you, son?

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:44.234
I know I've been used as a target.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:48.279
I know a buddy of mine's been killed.

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:53.277
And I know it all could have been avoided
if somebody would have filled me in.

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:57.224
And I know I'm not your son, sir.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.854
Some kind of personal war.

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:09.199
A vendetta between you, T.C.,
this Nu <i>z</i> o and who?

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:11.638
You tell me, you're the intelligence officer.

01:10:11.673 --> 01:10:15.609
Damn it, Magnum! I've got
a Japanese prince, his whole delegation,

01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:18.670
the Russians got something going down
this weekend,

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:21.308
and like it or not, you're involved.

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:23.682
Now, what is it?

01:10:26.955 --> 01:10:28.752
I don't think he knows, Colonel,

01:10:30.058 --> 01:10:32.652
or if he does, is going to say.

01:10:32.694 --> 01:10:34.753
I've got a reception to attend.

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:39.027
- Lieutenant, drive Mr. Magnum home.
- Admiral.

01:10:39.067 --> 01:10:41.661
That will be all, Colonel Greene.

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:43.931
Yes, sir.

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:49.275
Goodbye, son. Er... Mr. Magnum.

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:52.803
Sorry for the inconvenience.

01:11:02.057 --> 01:11:04.048
It's been a tough day for you.

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:08.290
That's an understatement, Lieutenant.

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:12.357
Would you like to stop
at the officers' club for a drink?

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:18.272
Who put you up to it? Buck or the admiral?

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:20.400
I don't understand.

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:24.208
Buck doesn't respect you enough.
Had to be the admiral.

01:11:24.246 --> 01:11:25.770
How far were you to go?

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:28.916
Just a drink.

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:42.586
Well, I'm glad you draw the line
at just one drink.

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:45.657
- You're making fun of me.
- No, I'm not.

01:11:46.868 --> 01:11:49.803
I'll bet you hate Buck calling you Maggie.

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:54.434
<i>O</i> ne of these days I'm gonna take
those birds on his shoulder and...

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:57.138
And do something very unprofessional
with them.

01:11:57.179 --> 01:11:59.511
I'll bet you will.

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:04.145
How well did you know Mac?

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:06.177
I liked Mac.

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:11.585
He treated me as an equal,

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:13.618
he never made a pass,

01:12:14.563 --> 01:12:16.554
and he always had me laughing.

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:22.132
Yeah. How would you like to help me
catch his killer?

01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:25.333
- Are you serious?
- Very, only there's one condition.

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:28.502
Nothing gets to Buck unless I <i>O</i> K it.

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:31.437
Deal?

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:34.838
Deal.

01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:49.020
- T.C., you look terrible. You all right?
- I need your wheels, man.

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:51.897
- I got a date.
- You can use the van.

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:56.066
Wait a minute. Let me see your eyes.

01:12:56.104 --> 01:12:58.368
Charlie's on my butt, man. I need your car.

01:12:58.407 --> 01:13:01.467
- Charlie?
- Look, <i>O</i> rville, I ain't got time to explain.

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:03.501
I need your car.

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:21.023
Next.

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:24.588
Next.

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:29.294
Next.

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:39.543
That's him <i>. O</i> nly his name's
not Mihael Korsky. It's Ivan.

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:43.142
He's not a Bulgarian trade officer.
He's a Russian K.G.B. colonel.

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:46.848
- How do you know that?
- I met him in North Vietnam.

01:13:47.789 --> 01:13:50.485
Duc Hue. Do you think he killed Mac?

01:13:50.525 --> 01:13:53.517
- Trying to kill me.
- Why?

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:58.321
I... I guess cos we escaped.

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:03.394
He was in Cairo on a trade mission
in <i>O</i> ctober 1981.

01:14:03.438 --> 01:14:05.599
Why does that date ring a bell?

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:10.373
It's when Sadat was assassinated
by military extremists.

01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:25.282
Hi, Higgins.

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.988
Magnum.

01:14:27.028 --> 01:14:30.293
You gave me a bit of a start.

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:32.664
Didn't the lads growl?

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:37.469
Seeing your condition,
I suppose they didn't consider it sporting,

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:40.100
sort of like shooting a sitting rabbit.

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:43.873
- Did T.C. show up?
- No. But Rick called.

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:46.312
I do wish you'd get an answering service.

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:48.509
I have one.

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:51.280
My point exactly.

01:14:51.319 --> 01:14:56.347
Rick seemed quite agitated.
Something about T.C. borrowing his car.

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:59.622
I never can quite tell with Rick.
He mumbles so.

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:01.823
Don't tell me.

01:15:01.863 --> 01:15:04.730
The bridge on the River Kwai.

01:15:06.468 --> 01:15:08.197
Quite.

01:15:08.236 --> 01:15:10.033
I was there, you know.

01:15:10.071 --> 01:15:14.098
- I was afraid you were.
- Nothing like the film.

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:18.010
Bridge was bombed,
not blown up by some American sailor.

01:15:19.347 --> 01:15:21.975
Not some American sailor. William Holden.

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:24.645
What are you talking about?
He was an actor.

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:26.244
<i>O</i> h, I see.

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:27.812
In the film.

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:34.558
I'm glad I escaped before it was destroyed.

01:15:35.997 --> 01:15:37.988
Had to be done, of course,

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:43.369
but I'd put too much bloody sweat
into it to watch it go up.

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:47.398
I remember one morning
we were sent out to cut teak for pilings...

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:52.770
<i>O</i> h, well, I'm sure he's bushed.

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:57.110
You'll enjoy this, lads.

01:15:57.152 --> 01:16:01.851
Lieutenant Bumgardner had a touch of malaria,
so I took his place that morning.

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:05.917
I was a mere lance corporal,
but nevertheless, the men looked up to me.

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:09.954
We were trudging through the jungle
when high overhead we heard a sound.

01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:13.297
There was Bumgardner
up in a tree, delirious,

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:16.736
shouting what can only be described
as an obscene chant.

01:16:18.039 --> 01:16:20.530
<i>Something Higgins said
touched off an idea.</i>

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:25.444
<i>It was like a jigsaw puzzle coming together
and I still didn't have all the pieces.</i>

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:30.645
<i>But the answer had to do with me,
T.C., Nuzo and William Holden.</i>

01:16:41.062 --> 01:16:43.053
<i>Any cigars left, Cookie?</i>

01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:51.229
<i>The sniping happened so fast,
I didn't really question how Ivan found us.</i>

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:56.267
<i>He could have tailed us, but Ivan hadn't
proved to be the best of trackers in the past.</i>

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:17.621
Ease up, ease up.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.463
- They're going in the wrong direction.
- What?

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:24.665
That girl knows where we crossed.

01:17:24.706 --> 01:17:26.367
Ivan didn't believe her.

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:30.067
That don't make sense.

01:17:30.111 --> 01:17:34.571
What difference does it make?
Man, we're going home. We're going home.

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:36.607
<i>They do that sometimes,</i>

01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:40.610
<i>just put an agent in with us,
a trained specialist.</i>

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:45.319
<i>Maybe he's a German
the Krauts planted in this barracks.</i>

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.922
<i>- In this barracks?
- Why not? Just one of the boys.</i>

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:53.264
<i>Sharing our bunks, eating our chow.</i>

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:56.998
<i>It suddenly hit me.
Ivan had let us escape.</i>

01:17:57.038 --> 01:17:59.529
<i>That meant there was a reason
for his brutality.</i>

01:17:59.574 --> 01:18:03.874
<i>I didn't know what it was,
but I had a good idea who would.</i>

01:18:21.578 --> 01:18:23.910
How's your head?

01:18:24.615 --> 01:18:26.276
Worse.

01:18:26.317 --> 01:18:28.842
Remember how I used to cure it
at Duc Hue?

01:18:32.156 --> 01:18:34.647
It's <i>O</i> K. You can remember now.

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:38.321
Yeah.

01:18:38.362 --> 01:18:41.195
Yeah. You used to make the pain go away.

01:18:44.468 --> 01:18:45.958
Deep-six the gum.

01:18:53.610 --> 01:18:56.306
The pain will be gone in a minute.

01:18:59.049 --> 01:19:00.744
- Thanks.
- Hey.

01:19:02.386 --> 01:19:04.718
We are brothers.

01:19:28.579 --> 01:19:30.570
That is not Nu <i>z</i> o!

01:19:32.049 --> 01:19:35.018
That induction photo
was taken 17 years ago.

01:19:35.052 --> 01:19:38.215
- People change.
- Not the color of their eyes, Buck.

01:19:38.255 --> 01:19:42.885
The Nu <i>z</i> o that T.C. and I escaped from
Duc Hue with had brown eyes, not green.

01:19:42.926 --> 01:19:47.920
Wait a minute. Sir, I can overlap that
surveillance photo you just took with this.

01:19:54.271 --> 01:19:55.829
Who the hell is he?

01:19:55.873 --> 01:19:59.309
Probably some Russian
psychologist with the K.G.B.

01:19:59.343 --> 01:20:01.937
The real Nu <i>z</i> o was either killed or died.

01:20:01.979 --> 01:20:05.346
The Nu <i>z</i> o that T.C. and I were in prison with
took his place.

01:20:05.382 --> 01:20:07.111
Why?

01:20:07.951 --> 01:20:10.977
I think to get T.C. to assassinate
your Japanese prince.

01:20:11.021 --> 01:20:15.720
<i>- O</i> h, come on, T.C. wouldn't do that.
- T.C. wouldn't take drugs either, Rick.

01:20:15.759 --> 01:20:17.750
At least not willing...

01:20:18.362 --> 01:20:20.125
Damn.

01:20:20.164 --> 01:20:22.257
Nu <i>z</i> o was always giving T.C. gum.

01:20:22.299 --> 01:20:26.235
- T.C. doesn't chew gum.
- I still don't understand.

01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:30.900
What if T.C. was drugged and somehow
programmed by the Russians in Duc Hue?

01:20:30.941 --> 01:20:35.139
- Programmed to do what?
- To kill.

01:20:35.179 --> 01:20:38.979
To activate him, Nu <i>z</i> o slipped him
the same drug in the gum.

01:20:39.016 --> 01:20:40.950
You guys are looney tunes.

01:20:40.984 --> 01:20:43.680
I don't care how you drug or program T.C.,

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:46.985
you couldn't get him to kill
the Japanese prince, no way.

01:20:47.024 --> 01:20:50.619
You could, if he thought
he was killing someone else.

01:20:51.695 --> 01:20:52.684
Who?

01:20:53.964 --> 01:20:55.124
Ivan.

01:20:59.403 --> 01:21:01.394
This is your target.

01:21:04.274 --> 01:21:07.004
- The Valley of the Temples?
- No. Look closer.

01:21:07.044 --> 01:21:09.672
It is not the Valley of the Temples.

01:21:09.713 --> 01:21:13.205
It is Quan Loi,
the N.V.A. ville off Go Noi Island.

01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:15.241
Do you remember?

01:21:18.722 --> 01:21:20.553
Quan Loi.

01:21:20.591 --> 01:21:22.650
Yeah, we took it out.

01:21:22.693 --> 01:21:27.062
That's right. They rebuilt it.
And he will be there tomorrow.

01:21:27.097 --> 01:21:31.227
- At 0800 hours.
- Who?

01:21:31.268 --> 01:21:33.259
Me, nigger.

01:21:34.571 --> 01:21:37.438
I was afraid
you would have forgotten me.

01:21:37.474 --> 01:21:39.169
But you would not do that.

01:21:41.845 --> 01:21:44.678
Not after Cookie.

01:21:54.525 --> 01:21:56.720
I will be waiting at Quan Loi.

01:22:01.431 --> 01:22:04.923
You remember now, nigger. Quan Loi.

01:22:07.004 --> 01:22:08.665
Cookie.

01:22:09.573 --> 01:22:11.165
Cookie.

01:22:11.208 --> 01:22:14.177
Remember Cookie.

01:22:14.211 --> 01:22:16.202
Tomorrow. Tomorrow!

01:22:17.814 --> 01:22:19.213
Quan Loi.

01:22:19.249 --> 01:22:20.910
0800 hours.

01:22:21.985 --> 01:22:24.317
What do we do?

01:22:28.292 --> 01:22:31.056
We waste Ivan!

01:22:31.094 --> 01:22:35.326
<i>What do you say we drive up
to Pali Lookout and watch the sunrise?</i>

01:22:35.365 --> 01:22:40.098
<i>I wondered how long I'd keep
counting sunrises. Maybe the rest of my life.</i>

01:22:40.137 --> 01:22:44.096
We all have our problems, Captain.
I surely do.

01:22:44.141 --> 01:22:46.939
I don't wanna hear any excuses. Find it.

01:22:51.348 --> 01:22:54.545
Can't be more than
a do <i>z</i> en Mercedes 450s on this island,

01:22:54.585 --> 01:22:57.816
and the F.B. I. And Five <i>- O</i> can't find one?

01:22:57.854 --> 01:23:00.482
They're not looking in the right places.

01:23:23.213 --> 01:23:24.202
Morning.

01:23:24.248 --> 01:23:28.685
How did you get here?
This is a restricted area. Lieutenant Calvin?

01:23:31.788 --> 01:23:34.723
Sir, how did you get a civilian vehicle
into this area?

01:23:34.758 --> 01:23:36.851
I got a mission to fly.

01:23:40.364 --> 01:23:44.960
Lieutenant, if you'll wait right here,
I'll call the duty officer. Lieutenant Calvin!

01:23:50.274 --> 01:23:51.798
Go!

01:24:01.551 --> 01:24:05.317
Sappers! They've broken through the wire!

01:24:25.175 --> 01:24:27.837
Right, T.C., let's get this bird outta here.

01:24:51.802 --> 01:24:54.362
Up! Go on!

01:25:19.129 --> 01:25:21.620
Damn. I'm on my way.

01:25:23.033 --> 01:25:25.365
T.C. just stole a Loach from the marines.

01:25:25.402 --> 01:25:27.165
- You're kidding.
- I wish I were.

01:25:27.204 --> 01:25:28.865
I'm going with you.

01:25:48.558 --> 01:25:50.890
<i>Delta Three, Delta Ten.</i>

01:25:59.803 --> 01:26:01.794
<i>Delta Three, Delta Ten.</i>

01:26:07.477 --> 01:26:10.105
<i>He's flown under our radar.</i>

01:26:10.147 --> 01:26:12.775
<i>- They lost him on radar.</i>
- I heard.

01:26:13.417 --> 01:26:16.477
Buck, where's the Japanese delegation?

01:26:17.921 --> 01:26:21.914
<i>O</i> h, my God <i>. O</i> n their way
to the Valley of the Temples.

01:26:35.972 --> 01:26:38.839
<i>Delta Ten, Delta Three.</i>

01:26:38.875 --> 01:26:41.605
<i>Taking heavy automatic fire,
RPGs and mortars.</i>

01:26:41.645 --> 01:26:47.447
<i>Quan Loi village, grid 23</i>%<i>551.</i>
<i>Heavy automatic fire.</i>

01:26:47.484 --> 01:26:51.011
<i>Delta Three, Delta Ten. Loach on its way.</i>

01:26:51.054 --> 01:26:53.784
<i>Switch to air-support freq.
Codename Fandance.</i>

01:26:53.824 --> 01:26:57.590
<i>Delta Three leaving freq to air support.
Freq leaving now.</i>

01:26:57.627 --> 01:27:01.119
<i>Fandance, Fandance.
Three needs immediate...</i>

01:27:03.066 --> 01:27:05.432
<i>Patch me into marine TAC frequency.</i>

01:27:05.469 --> 01:27:08.768
What was our call sign
on the mission we got captured?

01:27:08.805 --> 01:27:14.209
- I don't know, I wasn't with you then.
<i>- O</i> ur last mission in Nam, what was it?

01:27:14.244 --> 01:27:16.678
Blueboy. No, no, Fandance.

01:27:17.914 --> 01:27:19.905
Cannonball, Cannonball, Casey Jones.

01:27:19.950 --> 01:27:22.976
<i>Cannonball, Cannonball,
this is Casey Jones.</i>

01:27:23.019 --> 01:27:25.249
<i>Cannonball, Cannonball.</i>

01:27:29.826 --> 01:27:32.693
<i>Yellow smoke. Request shell.</i>

01:27:32.729 --> 01:27:35.664
<i>- Fandance, roger that.
- Priority one.</i>

01:27:35.699 --> 01:27:38.463
<i>Delta Three, meet Dust-Off. Urgent. Urgentl.</i>

01:27:48.311 --> 01:27:53.476
<i>- Delta Three, switch to air vac.
- Dust-Off, Delta Three. Urgent, wounded.</i>

01:27:53.517 --> 01:27:58.250
<i>- Repeat - we have wounded. Four critical.
- Delta Three, is the area secure?</i>

01:27:58.288 --> 01:28:00.779
<i>- Negative.
- Roger, Delta Three. Coming in.</i>

01:28:00.824 --> 01:28:04.351
<i>- Delta Three, can you give me smoke?
- Negative. I'll talk you in.</i>

01:28:04.394 --> 01:28:09.798
<i>Cannonball, this is Casey Jones.
Do you read? Casey Jones, do you read?</i>

01:28:09.833 --> 01:28:13.234
<i>- One minute.</i>
- Casey, this is Cannonball.

01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:15.101
He's making a run on the temples.

01:28:23.647 --> 01:28:29.313
<i>Three-Ten,

01:28:32.322 --> 01:28:36.019

01:29:54.037 --> 01:29:55.902
Port side, buddy.

01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:09.541
What's happening?

01:30:10.654 --> 01:30:12.451
What's happening?

01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:16.122
We're going home.

01:30:42.419 --> 01:30:47.049
<i>It was the third sunrise since Mac died
and I was still counting.</i>

01:30:47.824 --> 01:30:51.988
<i>The military flew T.C. to Walter Reed
to deprogram and detoxify.</i>

01:30:52.028 --> 01:30:55.828
<i>Whatever was in that gum didn't look like</i>
<i>it would cause permanent damage</i>,

01:30:55.865 --> 01:30:58.197

<i>Nuzo gave a wonde</i> rf <i>ul pe</i> rf <i>ormance</i>

<i>as the Vietnam vet
suffering from delayed stress,</i>

01:31:04.107 --> 01:31:06.871
<i>until the F.B.I. compared his prints
to the real Nuzo's.</i>

01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:10.971
<i>Then he forgot how to speak English
and asked to see the Russian ambassador.</i>

01:31:11.014 --> 01:31:14.848
<i>And Ivan... Ivan was gonna go scot-free.</i>

01:31:14.884 --> 01:31:16.681
<i>It seems that even though T.C. and I</i>

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:20.816
<i>could testify to Ivan's real identity
and to what he'd done to Cookie in Duc Hue,</i>

01:31:20.857 --> 01:31:24.657
<i>the State Department didn't want
to offend the Russians at this time.</i>

01:31:24.694 --> 01:31:28.562
<i>So they listed him as a Bulgarian
diplomat, granting him immunity.</i>

01:31:28.598 --> 01:31:30.589
<i>Admiral Hawkes was furious.</i>

01:31:30.633 --> 01:31:34.228
<i>The best he could do was declare him
undesirable and ask him to leave.</i>

01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:36.602
<i>And that wasn't good enough.</i>

01:32:18.414 --> 01:32:20.075
Move the car.

01:32:20.116 --> 01:32:23.449
If I could do that, I wouldn't be
in the middle of the road.

01:32:33.096 --> 01:32:35.121
Hello, Ivan.

01:32:35.165 --> 01:32:37.497
Let's take a walk.

01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:49.840
You mean that's not the carburetor?

01:33:14.604 --> 01:33:16.595
That's far enough.

01:33:31.354 --> 01:33:33.345
Cigarette?

01:33:36.459 --> 01:33:40.020
Perhaps I should have killed you
at Duc Hue.

01:33:40.063 --> 01:33:42.429
Why didn't you?

01:33:42.465 --> 01:33:46.196
Captain Mihael,
Nuzo as you know him, and I

01:33:46.236 --> 01:33:48.363
decided we needed you to control T.C.

01:33:53.376 --> 01:33:55.867
Without you,
he'd never have tried to escape.

01:33:55.912 --> 01:33:58.380
He would have tried to kill me instead.

01:33:58.414 --> 01:34:01.008
And you tried to kill me here.

01:34:01.050 --> 01:34:05.851
Yes, so you would not interfere,
which you obviously did.

01:34:05.889 --> 01:34:08.483
My congratulations, Lieutenant.

01:34:10.994 --> 01:34:14.486
It was all planned, back at Duc Hue?

01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:18.125
Not specifics, not even target.

01:34:18.167 --> 01:34:20.294
Just trigger.

01:34:22.005 --> 01:34:24.667
How many others are out there like T.C.?

01:34:24.707 --> 01:34:29.144
You are still schoolboy, Thomas,
using schoolboy tricks.

01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:32.371
No tricks.

01:34:33.583 --> 01:34:37.144
Who's next on your hit list?
Begin? Thatcher?

01:34:37.186 --> 01:34:38.744
Reagan?

01:34:39.789 --> 01:34:41.984
I have plane to catch.

01:34:42.025 --> 01:34:45.188
If you are going to shoot me, do it now.

01:34:49.098 --> 01:34:51.259
You won't.

01:34:51.301 --> 01:34:53.667
You can't.

01:34:53.703 --> 01:34:58.640
I know you, Thomas. I had you
for three months at Duc Hue.

01:34:58.675 --> 01:35:01.610
I know you better than your mother.

01:35:01.644 --> 01:35:06.081
Your sense of honor and fair play.

01:35:07.717 --> 01:35:13.349
You could shoot me,
if I was armed and coming after you.

01:35:13.389 --> 01:35:16.517
But like this, Thomas,

01:35:16.559 --> 01:35:18.356
never.

01:35:24.167 --> 01:35:26.158
Goodbye, Thomas.

01:35:37.246 --> 01:35:38.907
Ivan.

01:35:39.916 --> 01:35:41.406
Yes?

01:35:44.787 --> 01:35:47.779
Did you see the sunrise this morning?

01:35:48.992 --> 01:35:50.687
Yes. Why?
