00:10.940 --> 00:12.841

to move on.

I assume it'll be nice

with a fresh kitten.

Man, that show is sloppy.
So what's gonna happen?

08:51.955 --> 08:53.222
It's only a matter of time
before one of us

08:53.290 --> 08:54.958
Takes Pierce's place.

08:55.026 --> 08:58.562
Well, I sure as hell
am not gonna be the new Pierce.

08:58.630 --> 09:03.667
And if all we need
is an escape-goat,

09:03.735 --> 09:05.669
I think we should just let
this one go.

09:05.737 --> 09:07.704
Sometimes you've got
to be pretending, Troy.

09:07.772 --> 09:09.072
Maybe the new Pierce is Britta.

09:09.140 --> 09:10.473
Yeah, right.

09:10.541 --> 09:11.807
How do you pronounce bagel
again?

09:11.875 --> 09:14.910
- Bah-gel.
- She calls bagels bah-gels.

09:14.978 --> 09:17.245
We do make fun of a lot
of what you do and say.

09:17.313 --> 09:19.147
Yeah.
Right to my face,

09:19.214 --> 09:21.916
'cause I can take it,
unlike a certain someone else.

09:21.984 --> 09:23.117
- [gasps]
- [Mimics gasp]

09:23.185 --> 09:26.054
[gasps]
all: [mimic gasp]

09:26.122 --> 09:27.890
Come on, everybody,
let's not make fun of Annie.

09:27.957 --> 09:30.059
No, no,
I don't want anybody's pity.

09:30.127 --> 09:31.494
You know, come to think of it,
after Pierce,

09:31.562 --> 09:32.862
You're the most bigoted.
What?

09:32.930 --> 09:33.930
All: Mm.

09:33.998 --> 09:34.931
When you found out
I was Jewish,

09:34.999 --> 09:36.199
You invited me to a pool party

09:36.267 --> 09:37.567
That turned out
to be a baptism.

09:37.635 --> 09:39.603
Well, excuse me for trying
to sneak you into heaven.

09:39.671 --> 09:41.772
Ooh, what about abed?
Abed's weird.

09:43.941 --> 09:45.108
No, it's not abed.

09:45.176 --> 09:46.710
He's all right.
We like abed.

09:46.778 --> 09:48.345
Guys, have you considered

09:48.413 --> 09:50.914
The new Pierce concept
is stupid?

09:50.982 --> 09:53.583
Spoken like the new Pierce.

09:53.651 --> 09:56.019
- You're right.
- I am not the new Pierce.

09:56.087 --> 09:58.255
[arguing]
You said the world wide Web.

09:58.322 --> 10:00.390
Damn the old Pierce.
Oh, he makes me so mad.

10:00.457 --> 10:02.058
- You're Pierce's cousin.
- Don't double Pierce me.

10:02.126 --> 10:03.192
And you're the triple Pierce.

10:03.260 --> 10:05.060
- That's so unfair.
- Guys, guys.

10:05.128 --> 10:07.430
I can't believe
I'm gonna utter these words,

10:07.497 --> 10:10.397
But we need Pierce
in this group.

10:10.465 --> 10:12.367
But we can't ask Shirley
to let him back in.

10:12.435 --> 10:14.569
That would be so insensitive.

10:14.637 --> 10:16.371
Well, maybe he'll admit
he's wrong...

10:16.438 --> 10:20.608
Two, three, four.
Uh, not!

10:22.845 --> 10:24.112
[snorts]

10:24.180 --> 10:26.048
We need Pierce.

10:26.116 --> 10:28.718
Just stick to the script
and make it sincere.

10:28.785 --> 10:29.852
It's not gonna be sincere

10:29.920 --> 10:31.388
Because I'm pretending
to apologize.

10:31.455 --> 10:32.656
Okay, but you're not getting
back in the group

10:32.723 --> 10:33.957
Unless she thinks
you're sincere.

10:34.025 --> 10:35.725
Stubborn fool.

10:35.793 --> 10:37.627
Can we hurry this up?

10:37.695 --> 10:39.329
Troy and I are pledging
the cool fraternity,

10:39.397 --> 10:41.164
And unbeknownst to us, we're
actually the target of ridicule

10:41.232 --> 10:42.665
And don't have a chance in hell
of getting in.

10:42.733 --> 10:43.867
Yeah.
They're making us walk around

10:43.934 --> 10:45.401
With pretzels in our butts.

10:45.469 --> 10:47.403
I put mustard on mine
like an idiot.

10:47.471 --> 10:50.573
Okay, Pierce, you can do this.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.642
Oh, boy.

11:01.150 --> 11:02.918
What's he...

11:08.224 --> 11:10.025
Yup.

11:10.093 --> 11:11.293
Shirley, I know
you don't want to hear

11:11.361 --> 11:13.362
What I have to say,

11:13.431 --> 11:14.698
But I owe you this.

11:14.765 --> 11:16.199
From the moment we first met,

11:16.267 --> 11:18.269
I knew you were gonna be--
- Seriously!

11:20.606 --> 11:24.175
Oh, Shirley!
[laughs]

11:24.243 --> 11:26.277
You are unbelievable!

11:26.345 --> 11:28.079
I'm not wearing my contacts.
These are mine.

11:28.147 --> 11:29.914
Give them to me.
Oh, but I'm a bag guy.

11:29.982 --> 11:31.883
You even have the same bag,
so I thought, you know...

11:31.951 --> 11:33.684
That's right, 'cause nothing
is ever your fault.

11:33.752 --> 11:34.752
You know what, screw you.

11:34.820 --> 11:35.787
I don't even owe you
an apology.

11:35.854 --> 11:37.422
They wrote this.

11:40.093 --> 11:41.760
Just pretend like you asleep.

11:41.828 --> 11:42.995
Just pretend like you asleep.

11:43.063 --> 11:44.697
Thank you!

11:44.765 --> 11:45.898
Now I fully understand

11:45.966 --> 11:47.834
Where I have always stood.

11:47.902 --> 11:49.169
I'm entitled to my pride

11:49.236 --> 11:50.904
Until it gets in the way
of what you guys want.

11:52.406 --> 11:53.773
Got nothing to say?

11:53.841 --> 11:55.108
Well, I do.

11:55.176 --> 11:56.543
I'm out of the group.

11:56.611 --> 11:58.679
- What--Shirley!
All: Shirley!

11:58.747 --> 12:00.014
Oh, Shirley, don't go.
Please.

12:00.082 --> 12:03.785
- Uh-oh, sassy, black Schmitty's
out of the group.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.553
Oh, no.
Not the group.

12:05.621 --> 12:07.888
Poor, sad, little Schmitties.

12:07.956 --> 12:11.358
Can't all of us
little Schmitties get along?

12:11.426 --> 12:12.458
Show me!
Would you please hurry up?

12:12.526 --> 12:13.659
I am late for my bikini wax.

12:13.727 --> 12:14.927
Hurry, please.
Who was that?

12:14.995 --> 12:17.330
- A punk-ass who needs
to be destroyed.

12:17.397 --> 12:19.031
And I just figured out how.

12:19.099 --> 12:21.467
Um, can we focus
on what's important here?

12:21.535 --> 12:23.002
Shirley thinks
we don't care about her.

12:23.069 --> 12:25.070
No, no, you're right.
You're right.

12:25.138 --> 12:26.538
You're right.
That's totally more important.

12:26.606 --> 12:28.173
I just--I just thought
of one thing.

12:28.241 --> 12:29.741
You need to bang
that kid's mom.

12:29.809 --> 12:32.712
Um, after we fix everything
with Shirley.

12:32.779 --> 12:33.980
Whoa!

12:34.047 --> 12:35.515
Yes, yes, yes,
we'll deal with Shirley,

12:35.582 --> 12:36.782
But that's brilliant!
I know.

12:36.850 --> 12:38.717
Because then anything
that he says about you...

12:38.785 --> 12:40.685
He'll be saying to a dude
that banged his mom!

12:40.753 --> 12:42.187
Oh, my God, you guys.

12:42.255 --> 12:44.088
- Sorry. Shirley.
- Shirley.

12:44.156 --> 12:45.990
- Okay.
- Yes!

12:50.488 --> 12:52.689
[car horn blasts]

12:55.526 --> 12:56.526
[car horn blasts]

13:01.765 --> 13:03.400
[beeps]

13:05.703 --> 13:06.937
All right, bye, everybody.

13:07.005 --> 13:08.705
Have a great day.

13:08.773 --> 13:09.907
Be right here
at 3:00, please.

13:09.975 --> 13:13.444
I'm in a hurry.

13:13.512 --> 13:16.480
Excuse me.

13:16.548 --> 13:17.582
Sorry to bother you.

13:17.649 --> 13:18.783
You don't happen to have

13:18.851 --> 13:20.418
An extra bottle of sports drink,
do you?

13:20.936 --> 13:22.303
Actually, I do.

13:22.370 --> 13:24.104
Here you go.
Oh, thanks.

13:24.172 --> 13:25.706
Gotta hydrate, right?

13:25.774 --> 13:27.908
But obviously you know.
You work out.

13:27.976 --> 13:30.477
Well, I try to keep things
where they should be.

13:30.545 --> 13:32.880
I think I might be
where should I be.

13:36.985 --> 13:39.152
I don't know
about your robot, abed.

13:39.220 --> 13:40.387
Boobatron's great.

13:40.454 --> 13:41.788
And once someone spills
bong water

13:41.856 --> 13:43.290
On his circuitry
and he comes alive,

13:43.358 --> 13:44.724
He's gonna make us
the coolest guys on campus

13:44.792 --> 13:45.826
And help us get babes.

13:45.894 --> 13:47.394
Those are real babes

13:47.462 --> 13:49.430
Who will really laugh at us.

13:49.498 --> 13:52.266
Hey.
You're my friend, right?

13:52.333 --> 13:53.600
Friends are supposed
to help each other,

13:53.668 --> 13:55.002
No matter what!

13:56.871 --> 13:58.505
Okay.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.908
Ridiculous situation descending
into heavy-handed drama

14:00.975 --> 14:02.376
For the illusion of story.

14:02.443 --> 14:05.078
Ch-ch-ch-ch.
Check.

14:05.146 --> 14:07.581
What?
That was awesome.

14:07.649 --> 14:08.983
All right, I am back in.

14:09.050 --> 14:10.384
Cool.

14:10.452 --> 14:12.419
All right, here we go.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.891
Just so you know, I'm Shirley.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.192
Wouldn't want you
reaching for me

14:20.260 --> 14:24.196
Should you get a hankering
for pancakes.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.665
I'm old, and I do not see well.

14:26.733 --> 14:27.833
And you already won,
so shut it.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.235
I won?
Oh, no.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.503
They want you in the group,
and I quit,

14:30.571 --> 14:31.638
So you go ahead
and hang with them.

14:31.706 --> 14:33.406
No, thanks.

14:33.474 --> 14:35.275
I'm sick of the way
that group treats me.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.342
Preaching to the choir.

14:36.410 --> 14:38.610
- Tell you what
I'm not gonna miss--

14:38.678 --> 14:40.212
Abed and Troy's
silly little games.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.980
Grow up, already.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.415
[laughs] and by the way,

14:43.483 --> 14:44.483
Thanks for including me.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.617
Please, you think
Annie and Britta

14:45.685 --> 14:46.718
Invite me when they take

14:46.786 --> 14:47.987
Those little weekend trips
to the mall?

14:48.054 --> 14:50.356
They just think of me
as some sort of mom.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.723
They both need
to learn some manners,

14:51.791 --> 14:53.359
And, you know what, Annie needs
to stop dating Vaughn.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.960
He is cute,
but he is not the kind of boy

14:55.028 --> 14:56.061
I envisioned her
ending up with.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.562
No matter how hard you try,

14:57.630 --> 14:59.832
You can never be as cool
or funny as they are.

14:59.899 --> 15:03.469
It's called respect,
and no one ever gave me diddly.

15:03.537 --> 15:05.805
Except me.

15:05.873 --> 15:07.974
I respect you more
than anyone else in the group.

15:08.042 --> 15:10.009
Which is why you pantsed me?

15:10.077 --> 15:13.647
Well, but, you see,
that wasn't wrong.

15:13.714 --> 15:14.848
Oh, for heaven's sakes,

15:14.916 --> 15:17.885
You are such a arrogant,
self-righteous ass.

15:17.952 --> 15:19.587
And you are a strong,
dignified woman

15:19.654 --> 15:21.522
Who's raising a family,
a bigger accomplishment

15:21.590 --> 15:23.524
Than anybody else in that room.

15:23.592 --> 15:24.859
And nobody can ever strip you
of that,

15:24.926 --> 15:26.494
Not even me.

15:26.561 --> 15:29.062
- You really believe that?
- Yes.

15:29.130 --> 15:31.598
And that's why you think
pantsing me wasn't wrong?

15:31.666 --> 15:33.033
It wasn't.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.702
[laughs]

15:35.769 --> 15:38.637
Hmm.

15:43.576 --> 15:44.509
What are you doing?

15:44.577 --> 15:46.011
Did I misread that?

15:46.079 --> 15:49.615
[moans happily]

15:49.683 --> 15:51.617
Oh, here, let me just do that.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.519
You sure
you don't want some vodka?

15:53.587 --> 15:54.820
Oh, I'm good.
I'm good.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.089
I'm at school.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.657
At 2:00 P.M.

15:57.725 --> 16:00.828
Did someone just take
a Schmitty?

16:00.896 --> 16:04.231
Hey. Looks like you'll be
calling somebody daddy soon.

16:04.299 --> 16:08.735
Or at least your mom will be
tonight.

16:17.345 --> 16:20.080
- Dude, you are so pathetic.
- Mark?

16:20.148 --> 16:21.982
Mom, I've been pwning
this loser all week,

16:22.050 --> 16:24.084
And he thinks that he can get
back at me through you.

16:24.152 --> 16:25.786
What? Pwning?

16:25.853 --> 16:26.920
Pwning.

16:26.988 --> 16:28.522
Do you even know what it means?

16:28.589 --> 16:31.157
Oh, I see what's going on here.

16:31.225 --> 16:33.526
Look, I don't want to come
between a son

16:33.593 --> 16:36.428
And his beautiful,
vivacious mom.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.130
Oh, my God, you are pathetic.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.332
Yeah. So's the dumb whore
who's in on it.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.101
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.302
I gotta tell you, Chantel,

16:44.370 --> 16:48.607
You have raised
a terrible human being.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.808
We're better than this.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.344
No, you're not!

16:51.412 --> 16:54.281
I raised a winner
who will continue to crush

16:54.348 --> 16:56.817
Junior college losers like you.

16:56.885 --> 16:59.854
Ooh!
All: Schmitty!

16:59.922 --> 17:02.390
I'm sorry.
This is a matter of pride.

17:02.458 --> 17:05.593
[sighs]

17:05.661 --> 17:06.993
What are you looking at?

17:07.061 --> 17:10.263
"what are you looking at?"
duh!

17:10.332 --> 17:12.066
[laughter]

17:14.435 --> 17:18.705
"what are you looking at?
Duh!" duh!

17:18.773 --> 17:20.308
School his ass, mark.

17:20.376 --> 17:23.877
"school his ass, mark."
duh!

17:23.945 --> 17:26.180
[blathers] duh.

17:26.248 --> 17:27.348
Duh. Duh. Duh.

17:27.415 --> 17:29.684
- Duh!
D-d-duh! Duh!

17:29.752 --> 17:34.723
All: [blathering
and shouting "duh"]

17:44.032 --> 17:45.099
Why are Jeff and Britta

17:45.167 --> 17:46.567
Making fun
of those handicapped kids?

17:46.635 --> 17:49.136
They don't even realize
how much they need us.

17:49.204 --> 17:53.207
All: [blathering
and shouting "duh"]

18:11.494 --> 18:12.861
Why are they doing this?

18:12.929 --> 18:14.196
I don't know if you've noticed,

18:14.263 --> 18:15.630
But Jeff and Britta
have the two most fragile egos

18:15.698 --> 18:16.932
Of the group.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.735
These kids will pretty much
destroy them.

18:19.803 --> 18:23.172
[blathering continues]

18:27.277 --> 18:30.112
Hey!

18:30.180 --> 18:31.681
- What are you doing?
- What the hell?

18:31.748 --> 18:33.683
Hey, you didn't say duh!

18:33.751 --> 18:35.618
- We win.
- No.

18:35.686 --> 18:37.120
You're the Schmitties.

18:37.188 --> 18:39.155
No, no, we're minors.

18:39.223 --> 18:40.623
- Yeah.
- I'm calling the cops.

18:40.691 --> 18:42.492
No, you're not.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.295
You have already embarrassed me
by getting pwned.

18:45.362 --> 18:48.298
Don't be such a girl.
Go.

18:48.365 --> 18:50.300
- Yeah. See that.
- Yes. Suck it!

18:50.367 --> 18:51.634
- Duh. Yeah.
- Schmitty face!

18:51.702 --> 18:53.402
And we showed you,
high schoolers!

18:53.470 --> 18:57.406
Congratulations
on your victory.

18:57.473 --> 18:59.341
Thank you, Annie.

18:59.408 --> 19:00.742
Yeah, thank you.

19:00.810 --> 19:01.910
And thanks, you guys.

19:01.978 --> 19:02.944
Any time.

19:03.012 --> 19:04.746
Look, Pierce and I
are considering

19:04.813 --> 19:07.381
Rejoining the group,
and maybe we can all be

19:07.449 --> 19:08.449
A little more mature.

19:08.517 --> 19:09.950
I hear that.

19:10.018 --> 19:11.785
Abed, I've had enough
of this list.

19:11.853 --> 19:13.186
Doing this stuff isn't fun.

19:13.254 --> 19:14.554
It just feels forced.

19:14.622 --> 19:16.989
Fine.
I'll deactivate boobatron.

19:17.057 --> 19:18.424
But trust me,
classic college experiences

19:18.492 --> 19:20.826
Never happen organically.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.496
Both: [gasp]

19:24.564 --> 19:25.697
[laughs]

19:27.567 --> 19:28.934
Both: Food fight!

19:29.002 --> 19:30.135
Oh, no!

19:30.203 --> 19:33.806
[shouting]

20:26.988 --> 20:29.322
Are you sure
it's the name of my grade school

20:29.390 --> 20:31.358
And my favorite soft drink?
Yup. Pretty sure.

20:31.925 --> 20:33.595
George Washington lemon fresca.

20:34.663 --> 20:35.829
That's a horrible porn name.

20:35.897 --> 20:36.997
I don't make the rules.

20:37.065 --> 20:38.099
What's yours?

20:38.166 --> 20:39.567
Henry David Thoreau
diet squirt.

20:39.635 --> 20:40.702
Oh, that's good.

20:40.769 --> 20:42.804
Hello, Henry David Thoreau
diet squirt.

20:42.872 --> 20:44.206
How many pornos
have you been in?

20:44.273 --> 20:46.742
6,012. How many pornos
have you been in,

20:46.810 --> 20:48.077
George Washington lemon fresca?

20:48.145 --> 20:49.879
2,019.
It's my first week.

20:49.946 --> 20:51.213
Impressive.

20:51.281 --> 20:52.181
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:52.249 --> 20:55.151
[porn music plays]

20:55.519 --> 20:58.555
Someone here order a pizza?

20:58.622 --> 20:59.989
Is it you guys?

21:00.057 --> 21:01.591
It has extra sausage.

21:01.659 --> 21:04.594
- No.
- It's big and hot.

21:04.662 --> 21:06.162
That's my pizza.

21:06.230 --> 21:08.031
But you took longer
than 30 minutes,

21:08.099 --> 21:10.866
So I'm not paying.

21:10.867 --> 21:17.867
