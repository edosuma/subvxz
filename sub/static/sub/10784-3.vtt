YOU MEAN YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
KISSED THAT GIRL?

00:56.041 --> 00:57.375
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE KISS, JOEY.

00:57.375 --> 00:58.500
IT'S ABOUT THE JOURNEY.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.708
IT'S ABOUT CREATING
AND SUSTAINING MAGIC.

01:00.708 --> 01:03.083
DOES JEN FALL FOR THIS
WARPED MOVIE LOGIC?

01:03.083 --> 01:03.708
IT'S NOT WARPED.
IT'S ROMANCE.

01:03.708 --> 01:05.625
IT'S OLD, DAWSON.

TAKE THE ELEVATOR TO THE NEXT
FLOOR AND GET OFF. IT'S TIME.

01:09.875 --> 01:11.000
OKAY, IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE, JOEY.

FOR THIS CONVERSATION.

01:55.542 --> 01:56.792
I'M SORRY, DAWSON,

01:56.792 --> 01:58.959
BUT ROMANCE DOESN'T COME
WITH A JOHN WILLIAMS SCORE.

01:58.959 --> 02:01.375

WITH A SUNSET

BY THIS MOVIE MENTALITY

10:01.250 --> 10:05.834
FORGET IT, JOEY, GUYS OFF YACHTS
DON'T GO FOR WAITRESSES.

10:05.834 --> 10:07.708
PACEY: HM?

10:07.708 --> 10:09.250
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

10:09.250 --> 10:10.583
ONE NIGHT
IN YOUR SLEEP...

10:10.583 --> 10:13.333
A SLIT THROAT, MAYBE,
OR A SCREWDRIVER TO YOUR TEMPLE.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.667
BE READY.

10:34.125 --> 10:35.667
HEY, DAWSON.

10:35.667 --> 10:38.125
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

10:38.125 --> 10:39.375
OH, JUST
LIVING A FANTASY.

10:39.375 --> 10:42.166
NO, SERIOUSLY.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.625
CLIFF GAVE ME A PART.

10:43.625 --> 10:45.250
AT NO POINT WAS THERE
A COUCH INVOLVED, RIGHT?

10:45.250 --> 10:47.708
NO. CLIFF'S
A VERY NICE GUY.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.208
AND I'VE GOT TWO LINES:

10:49.208 --> 10:50.917
"WAY TO GO" AND "THOSE WHALERS
SURE DO LOOK BIG."

10:50.917 --> 10:53.708
BUT, JEN, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE IN MY MOVIE,

10:53.708 --> 10:55.708
NOT THIS HOMAGE
TO HEADGEAR.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.208
HEY! GLAD YOU MADE IT.

10:57.208 --> 10:59.250
HI.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.750
JUST IN TIME. WE WERE
JUST ABOUT TO START.

11:01.750 --> 11:02.750
NELLIE: REHEARSAL'S UP!

11:06.375 --> 11:07.375
THANKS, DAVID.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.208
IT'S DAWSON.

11:25.917 --> 11:27.708
HAS ETHAN MADE IT
TO THE COUNTY FAIR YET?

11:27.708 --> 11:30.333
UH, YEAH.
YEAH, HE HAS.

11:30.333 --> 11:32.750
YES, HE HAS.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.500
AMAZING.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.458
THERE WAS NO COUNTY FAIR
WHEN I READ IT.

11:43.625 --> 11:45.500
WHAT WERE YOU
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

11:45.500 --> 11:47.625
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:47.625 --> 11:49.750
A JOCK? A BRAIN?
A CHEERLEADER?

11:49.750 --> 11:51.041
WHY?

11:51.041 --> 11:52.125
JUST CURIOUS.

11:52.125 --> 11:54.708
WELL, I WAS CAPTAIN
OF THE DANCE TEAM

11:54.708 --> 11:56.375
AND CLASS TREASURER.

11:56.375 --> 11:57.417
AND I STUDIED A LOT.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.792
BOYFRIEND?

11:59.792 --> 12:01.792
YES.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.375
A JOCK.

12:03.375 --> 12:06.542
CENTER FIELDER.
WHY ARE YOU ASKING?

12:06.542 --> 12:08.708
WOULD YOU HAVE DATED ME?

12:08.708 --> 12:09.375
SH--

12:09.375 --> 12:12.250
PACEY!

12:12.250 --> 12:13.875
WE'RE IN SCHOOL.
WE ARE NOT ALONE.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.500
THERE ARE PEOPLE
IN THIS BUILDING.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.166
AND IT'S
JUST A QUESTION.

12:18.166 --> 12:20.125
IF YOU AND I HAD GONE
TO SCHOOL TOGETHER

12:20.125 --> 12:22.625
AND WE WERE THE SAME AGE,
WOULD YOU HAVE DATED ME?

12:22.625 --> 12:25.125
PROBABLY NOT.

12:26.834 --> 12:30.250
BUT THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO,

12:30.250 --> 12:31.333
AND I'VE LEARNED A LOT.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.834
I'M SMARTER NOW.

12:33.834 --> 12:36.917
AT LEAST I WAS
UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.250
WHAT'S THIS?

12:41.250 --> 12:44.333
SUMMARY QUESTIONS
FOR THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.667
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.166
YOU ANSWER ALL OF THEM,

12:47.166 --> 12:49.708
AND PERHAPS I'LL GIVE YOU
SOME POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT.

12:50.750 --> 12:51.917
YEAH?

12:51.917 --> 12:53.250
YEAH.

13:07.708 --> 13:10.125
[VIOLIN PLAYING]

13:49.458 --> 13:51.708
NO APPLAUSE.

13:51.708 --> 13:53.667
JUST SEND MONEY.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.583
WAIT, WAIT. DON'T GO.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.333
YOU KNOW,
YOU WERE SPYING ON ME.

14:01.333 --> 14:02.625
IT'S A PUBLIC DOCK.

14:02.625 --> 14:04.667
NO, I MEAN, IT'S OKAY.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.333
MY NAME'S ANDERSON.

14:06.333 --> 14:06.834
ANDERSON CRAWFORD.

14:06.834 --> 14:09.000
CONGRATULATIONS.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.166
SO DO YOU COME WITH A NAME
OR JUST AN ATTITUDE?

14:14.166 --> 14:16.041
JUST AN ATTITUDE.

14:16.041 --> 14:17.417
AND PEOPLE
FIND THIS CHARMING?

14:17.417 --> 14:19.667
I HAVEN'T ASKED.

14:22.417 --> 14:25.000
SO, UM...

14:25.000 --> 14:27.500
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO CAPESIDE?

14:29.667 --> 14:30.708
TOUGH QUESTION?

14:30.708 --> 14:31.583
YEAH, I KNOW.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.583
YOU CAN
GET BACK TO ME.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.792
WELL, WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO CAPESIDE?

14:38.792 --> 14:40.208
OH, MY PARENTS.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.792
THEY'RE, UH,
ANTIQUE HOUNDS.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.792
THEY'RE ON THE HUNT
FOR SOME CHAIR.

14:44.792 --> 14:47.083
APPARENTLY, PAUL REVERE
ONCE PARKED IN IT.

14:47.083 --> 14:47.750
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
YOUR PARENTS,

14:47.750 --> 14:49.834
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?

14:49.834 --> 14:50.917
I'M THE CREW.

14:50.917 --> 14:53.083
BEATS GOING
TO BOARDING SCHOOL.

14:53.083 --> 14:56.542
YOU CAN ONLY TAKE THAT ALL-MALE
ENVIRONMENT FOR SO LONG.

14:56.542 --> 14:57.834
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M DOING
ALL THE SHARING HERE,

14:57.834 --> 15:00.875
SO TELL ME
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.

15:00.875 --> 15:02.375
WELL, I'M A PISCES.

15:02.375 --> 15:05.917
I'M INTO HARLEYS, BODY PIERCING

15:05.917 --> 15:08.625
HM. ARE YOU HERE
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

15:08.625 --> 15:10.583
YOU GUYS OWN A BOAT?

15:11.667 --> 15:12.792
UM...

15:12.792 --> 15:15.250
ACTUALLY, WE BROUGHT
THE CHAUFFEUR.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.458
MOTHER HATES TO SAIL.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.625
SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE SUN.

15:18.625 --> 15:21.250
SHE BURNS EASY.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.750
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

15:22.750 --> 15:24.750
I WEAR LOTION.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.542
NO, I MEAN DO YOU LIKE TO SAIL?

15:26.542 --> 15:28.250
WHY DO YOU ASK?

15:28.250 --> 15:29.667
I'M TAKING A SURVEY.

15:30.917 --> 15:34.625
BECAUSE I...WANT YOU
TO COME SAILING WITH ME.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.625
TOMORROW.

15:36.625 --> 15:37.500
I CAN'T.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.583
COME ON.
I'LL SHOW YOU MY TATTOO.

15:39.583 --> 15:41.000
GAP AD HAS A TATTOO?

15:41.000 --> 15:45.917
IF YOU COME SAILING,
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

15:45.917 --> 15:47.458
NOON?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.250
OKAY.

15:52.250 --> 15:53.625
MAYBE.

15:53.625 --> 15:55.083
I CAN LIVE WITH MAYBE,

15:55.083 --> 15:56.166
IF AT LEAST YOU
TELL ME YOUR NAME.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.333
DEBORAH KERR...

16:02.333 --> 16:04.291
SON.

16:04.291 --> 16:05.708
DEBORAH CARSON.

16:08.708 --> 16:09.708
DONE.

16:09.708 --> 16:10.708
QUIZ ME.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.792
OKAY. LET'S START EASY.

16:14.792 --> 16:17.291
WHAT WAS THE NAME
OF ETHAN'S WIFE?

16:17.291 --> 16:18.583
WHO IS ZEENA?

16:18.583 --> 16:19.208
CORRECT.

16:19.208 --> 16:21.125
SO WHAT DO I WIN?

16:21.125 --> 16:23.000
NOT SO FAST.
THERE'S MORE.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.166
WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE TOWN
IN WHICH THEY LIVED?

16:25.166 --> 16:26.959
WHAT IS STARKFIELD?

16:26.959 --> 16:28.125
VERY GOOD.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.625
RIGHT.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.208
I'M READY.

16:31.208 --> 16:33.291
ONE MORE.

16:33.291 --> 16:37.792
WHY DO YOU THINK ETHAN
HAD SUCH A STRONG SENSE OF DUTY?

16:37.792 --> 16:38.959
UH...

16:38.959 --> 16:41.125
YOU MUST CITE SOME EXAMPLES
FROM YOUR TEXT

16:41.125 --> 16:43.041
WHEN CONSTRUCTING
YOUR RESPONSE.

16:46.333 --> 16:48.667
THAT'S WHY
WE GOT TO GIVE IT 110%.

16:48.667 --> 16:49.834
DAWSON: 8 DAYS A WEEK.

16:49.834 --> 16:50.834
REMEMBER HOW HARD
WE WORKED THIS SUMMER?

16:50.834 --> 16:51.834
NOW'S WHEN IT PAYS OFF.

16:51.834 --> 16:53.834
WITH COMMUNAL SHOWERS.

16:53.834 --> 16:54.875
LET'S DO IT
FOR THE COACH.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.291
HE LIKES TO WATCH.

16:56.291 --> 16:58.625
LET'S GO OUT THERE AND
SHOW 'EM WHAT WE'RE MADE OF.

16:58.625 --> 16:59.542
INSERT CLICHÉ HERE.

16:59.542 --> 17:00.166
LET'S LAY IT
ON THE LINE.

17:00.166 --> 17:00.834
MAY I HAVE ANOTHER?

17:00.834 --> 17:03.834
WELL, WELL, WELL.

17:03.834 --> 17:07.208
DOES SOMEONE NEED TO HAVE A TALK
WITH MR. GOLD

17:07.208 --> 17:09.290
CUT!
ABOUT SOMEONE'S ATTITUDE?

17:09.290 --> 17:10.250
HM?

17:10.250 --> 17:11.208
GO FOR IT, NELLIE.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.125
OH, I WILL, BELIEVE ME.

17:13.125 --> 17:14.416
AS PRODUCER,

17:14.416 --> 17:17.290
I WILL TELL HIM EXACTLY HOW YOU
DISRUPTED FILMING

17:17.290 --> 17:20.834
AND DELAYED
THE ENTIRE PRODUCTION.

17:20.834 --> 17:22.125
WHEN DID YOU
START TO HATE ME?

17:22.125 --> 17:22.791
I MISSED IT.
WHAT DID I DO?

17:22.791 --> 17:24.333
IT'S WHAT YOU DIDN'T DO.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.708
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED
YOUR PLACE HERE, DAWSON.

17:27.708 --> 17:29.708
I WORKED ALL SUMMER
ON THE SCRIPT,

17:29.708 --> 17:31.834
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU
WALKING IN HERE

17:31.834 --> 17:34.625
AND TRASHING IT.

17:34.625 --> 17:36.083
I DON'T HATE YOU, DAWSON,

17:36.083 --> 17:37.708
BUT THIS IS BUSINESS.

17:37.708 --> 17:38.708
STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL.

17:38.708 --> 17:41.542
YOU NEED TO SHOW
A LITTLE GRATITUDE.

17:41.542 --> 17:43.000
NOW, YOU SHAPE UP,

17:43.000 --> 17:43.792
OR YOU'RE GOING
TO BE SHIPPED OUT.

17:43.792 --> 17:45.959
UNDERSTAND?

17:45.959 --> 17:47.250
CLIFF:
LET'S GO AGAIN!

17:52.375 --> 17:54.333
MAN: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
BACK TO ONE.

17:54.333 --> 17:57.959
PACEY: WHICH EXPLAINS HER
MOTIVATION OR DESIRE

17:57.959 --> 17:59.000
TO KEEP ETHAN FROM SEEING

17:59.000 --> 18:00.125
BEYOND THE SOMEWHAT
LIMITED SCOPE

18:00.125 --> 18:03.250
OF LIFE WITH HER
ON THE FARM.

18:03.250 --> 18:03.667
HM?

18:03.667 --> 18:06.250
WELL...

18:06.250 --> 18:07.291
WELL, WELL, WELL.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.792
AND MY REWARD IS?

18:12.792 --> 18:14.750
AH!
YOU GOT ME, PACEY.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.583
I NEVER EXPECTED YOU
TO GET THIS FAR.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.875
SO MS. JACOBS
WAS BLUFFING?

18:19.875 --> 18:21.667
YOUR REWARD
IS YOUR EDUCATION.

18:21.667 --> 18:25.208
NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:25.208 --> 18:26.917
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
I'LL OWE YOU.

18:26.917 --> 18:29.750
IT'S OKAY, TAMARA.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.083
NO, IT'S NOT.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.083
PACEY, NOT HERE, NOT NOW.

18:33.083 --> 18:34.834
THIS IS MY PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT.

18:34.834 --> 18:36.083
IT'S LATE.

18:36.083 --> 18:38.083
THERE'S NO JANITOR,
NO FILM CREW.

18:38.083 --> 18:38.750
EVERYBODY'S GONE HOME
FOR THE NIGHT.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.417
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

18:41.417 --> 18:42.333
PACEY!

18:42.333 --> 18:44.250
WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

18:46.583 --> 18:47.250
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:50.208 --> 18:53.417
LET'S DO IT.

18:53.417 --> 18:55.750
BUT WHERE SHOULD WE DO IT?
OH, I KNOW.

18:55.750 --> 18:57.708
MY DESK. OUR FIRST TIME
SHOULD BE ON MY DESK.

18:57.708 --> 19:01.333
STRIP.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.625
HURRY UP.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

19:03.625 --> 19:04.417
BETTER DROP THEM.

19:04.417 --> 19:06.375
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.500
YOU'RE CALLING MY BLUFF
TO SEE HOW FAR I'LL TAKE IT.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.208
NO, NO, NO.
I'M DEADLY SERIOUS.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.458
TAKE THEM OFF.

19:15.125 --> 19:17.625
I'M ON TO YOU, TAMARA.
I...I...

19:17.625 --> 19:18.625
YOU THINK
I'M GOING TO CAVE,

19:18.625 --> 19:20.000
THAT I WOULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.291
DO YOU HAVE CONDOMS,
PACEY?

19:21.291 --> 19:24.708
BECAUSE WE ARE GOING
TO NEED CONDOMS.

19:24.708 --> 19:26.667
IT IS A HIGH SCHOOL.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.208
I'M SURE YOU CAN
ROUND SOME UP.

19:29.208 --> 19:30.625
I, UH...

19:30.625 --> 19:32.291
WHAT'S WRONG?

19:32.291 --> 19:34.375
WELL...THIS JUST ISN'T
THE MOST

19:34.375 --> 19:36.417
ROMANTIC PLACE
ON EARTH, YOU KNOW.

19:36.417 --> 19:40.208
WHAT, IS THIS
YOUR FIRST TIME, PACEY?

19:44.166 --> 19:46.000
YOU KNOW THAT IT IS.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.417
GO HOME, PACEY.

19:51.417 --> 19:53.333
YOU NEED TO FIND
A GIRL YOUR OWN AGE,

19:53.333 --> 19:57.834
NOT SOME INSANE
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.

19:57.834 --> 19:58.834
NO, BUT--

19:58.834 --> 20:00.291
NO BUTS, PLEASE.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.166
LOOK, THIS CAN'T GO
ONE SECOND FURTHER.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.083
THIS IS BEYOND WRONG.

20:03.083 --> 20:03.875
I HOPE YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT.

20:03.875 --> 20:06.291
LOOK AT ME.

20:06.291 --> 20:08.750
YOU KEEP SAYING
HOW THIS IS WRONG,

20:08.750 --> 20:10.792
AND MAYBE
TONIGHT IT IS,

20:10.792 --> 20:12.708
BUT JUST TO SET
THE RECORD STRAIGHT,

20:12.708 --> 20:14.542
I'M A FIRM BELIEVER
THAT SOMETIMES

20:14.542 --> 20:18.583
IT'S RIGHT
TO DO THE WRONG THING.

20:29.834 --> 20:32.250
GOOD NIGHT...

20:32.250 --> 20:33.250
TAMMY.

21:14.291 --> 21:14.875
DEBORAH.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.792
DEBORAH CARSON.

21:16.792 --> 21:19.125
ANDERSON.

21:19.125 --> 21:20.834
ANDERSON CRAWFORD.

21:20.834 --> 21:23.583
WOW.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.625
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.375
YEAH?

21:30.625 --> 21:31.583
YEAH.

21:31.583 --> 21:32.917
YOU WANT TO COME ABOARD?

21:32.917 --> 21:36.250
HERE. I'LL HELP YOU.

21:36.250 --> 21:39.208
MY PARENTS KNOW SOME CARSONS
WHO WINTER IN PALM BEACH.

21:39.208 --> 21:40.375
ANY RELATION?

21:41.708 --> 21:43.792
NO. WE'RE PRETTY MUCH
MANHATTAN-BOUND.

21:43.792 --> 21:45.250
WHERE'D YOU
GO TO SCHOOL?

21:45.250 --> 21:46.333
CHOATE.

21:46.333 --> 21:48.417
IT'S A DRAG, ISN'T IT?

21:48.417 --> 21:49.375
WHAT?

21:49.375 --> 21:50.166
BOARDING SCHOOL.

21:50.166 --> 21:52.583
WELL, I DON'T THINK SO.

21:52.583 --> 21:53.792
I KIND OF LIKE IT.

21:53.792 --> 21:55.792
WHAT'S THERE
TO LIKE ABOUT IT?

21:55.792 --> 21:57.625
WELL, IT'S
A PRIVILEGED EXISTENCE.

21:57.625 --> 21:59.542
I MEAN,
THINK OF THE OPTION.

21:59.542 --> 22:02.208
YOU COULD BE STUCK
IN A SMALL TOWN LIKE THIS,

22:02.208 --> 22:04.500
WHERE...NOTHING EXCITING
EVER HAPPENS.

22:04.500 --> 22:08.250
IT'S NOT THE EDUCATION
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.667
IT'S MORE
THE BOARDING PART.

22:09.667 --> 22:11.166
SEEMS KIND OF UNNATURAL.

22:11.166 --> 22:13.250
TAKEN AWAY
WHEN YOU'RE 12,

22:13.250 --> 22:14.667
SEPARATED
FROM YOUR FAMILY.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.667
JUST DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

22:16.667 --> 22:17.667
YEAH.

22:17.667 --> 22:20.667
I KEEP THINKING
I'LL GET USED TO IT,

22:20.667 --> 22:23.083
BUT...I NEVER DO.

22:25.250 --> 22:28.542
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU SAILED.

22:28.542 --> 22:31.250
WELL, I'M A WOMAN
OF MANY TALENTS.

23:25.583 --> 23:27.500
ANDERSON: MY DAD'S INTO
INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.166
HE DOESN'T REALLY WORK.
HE JUST MAKES MONEY.

23:29.166 --> 23:30.750
WHAT ABOUT YOURS?

23:30.750 --> 23:34.875
OH, HE'S A CEO OF
A HUGE CONGLOMERATE.

23:34.875 --> 23:37.083
REALLY? WHICH ONE?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.834
ONE OF THE NATION'S
BEST-SELLING TAMPONS.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.583
OH.

23:41.583 --> 23:44.041
SO WHAT'S
YOUR BOYFRIEND LIKE?

23:45.250 --> 23:49.625
IS THIS YOUR BACKWARDS WAY
OF ASKING IF I HAVE ONE?

23:49.625 --> 23:53.917
WELL, I JUST ASSUMED
THAT YOU DID.

23:53.917 --> 23:55.959
AND WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK THAT?

23:55.959 --> 23:57.250
THE WAY YOU CARRY YOURSELF.

23:57.250 --> 24:00.166
YOU'RE REALLY HANDS-OFF.

24:00.166 --> 24:02.583
IT'S LIKE A CLEAR RADIO SIGNAL,
YOU KNOW?

24:02.583 --> 24:04.125
I GUESS IF I WERE
SEEING SOMEBODY,

24:04.125 --> 24:08.583
I'D WANT THEM TO GIVE OFF
THE SAME VIBE.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.250
AND HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF SHE
SAILED TO A DESERTED BEACH

24:10.250 --> 24:13.750
WITH SOME MYSTERY MAN?

24:13.750 --> 24:16.917
WELL, AS LONG AS SHE
DIDN'T KEEP IT SECRET,

24:16.917 --> 24:19.208
YOU KNOW,
DIDN'T LIE ABOUT IT,

24:19.208 --> 24:21.625
TRUTH CAN'T HURT YOU.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.166
IT'S THE LIES THAT KILL.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.667
HONESTY IS STILL
THE PRIMARY QUALITY

24:26.667 --> 24:28.291
I'M LOOKING
FOR IN A GIRL.

24:31.166 --> 24:32.291
CLIFF: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY!

24:32.291 --> 24:33.917
WE CAN DO THIS!

24:33.917 --> 24:36.208
AND...ACTION!

24:36.208 --> 24:38.792
JOHN, DON'T THINK OF IT
AS A FOOTBALL TEAM.

24:38.792 --> 24:39.250
THINK OF IT AS A FAMILY.

24:39.250 --> 24:41.166
HOW SO, TIM?

24:41.166 --> 24:42.583
WELL, IF WE PLAY
LIKE A FAMILY,

24:42.583 --> 24:44.875
WE MIGHT BE JUST ABLE
TO BEAT BRISTER.

24:44.875 --> 24:46.250
NOW YOU'RE TALKING. THAT'S WHAT
I CALL MINUTEMAN PRIDE--

24:46.250 --> 24:48.041
CLIFF: CUT!

24:49.625 --> 24:50.875
OH!

24:50.875 --> 24:53.917
DO YOU THINK WE CAN GET SOMEBODY
WHO'S NOT EPILEPTIC

24:53.917 --> 24:54.458
TO RUN THE CAMERA?

24:54.458 --> 24:56.291
YOU TRY IT.

24:56.291 --> 24:57.375
YOU RUN BACKWARDS
WITH A HAND-HELD

24:57.375 --> 24:59.458
AND SEE IF YOU CAN
DO IT ANY BETTER.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.291
THERE'S ACTUALLY A TECHNIQUE.
IF YOU BRACE YOUR ARMS--

25:01.291 --> 25:03.166
DID YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

25:03.166 --> 25:05.625
LOOKING GOOD.

25:06.792 --> 25:10.291
WE NEED MORE TAPE
FROM THE FILM LAB.

25:10.291 --> 25:13.667
GO FETCH, DOGGIE DAWSON.

25:15.125 --> 25:16.333
HEY.
HEY.

25:16.333 --> 25:17.708
HOW'S IT GOING
BACK THERE?

25:17.708 --> 25:19.708
ARE THEY READY FOR THE
ALL-IMPORTANT CHEERLEADERS YET?

25:19.708 --> 25:21.333
HARDLY. THEY HAVEN'T EVEN
GOT A USEABLE TAKE

25:21.333 --> 25:22.542
OF THE FIRST SCENE.

25:22.542 --> 25:24.667
LET'S JUST SAY
THAT AS A DIRECTOR,

25:24.667 --> 25:25.667
YOUR FRIEND CLIFF
IS A GREAT QUARTERBACK.

25:25.667 --> 25:28.250
WELL, WE CAN'T
ALL BE PRODIGIES.

25:28.250 --> 25:31.083
AND HELMETS OF GLORY?

25:31.083 --> 25:33.125
CAN YOU EVEN SAY IT
WITH A STRAIGHT FACE?

25:33.125 --> 25:35.417
BARELY.

25:35.417 --> 25:36.083
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

25:36.083 --> 25:37.667
I DON'T GET IT.

25:37.667 --> 25:40.375
EXCEPT TO WATCH ME
GET HUMILIATED.

25:40.375 --> 25:43.708
BECAUSE I KNEW
YOU'D BE HERE. HELLO?

25:43.708 --> 25:46.041
HEY, IF WE FINISH EARLY,
YOU WANT TO HELP ME GET
THAT MAGIC-HOUR SHOT?

25:46.041 --> 25:49.083
ABSOLUTELY. I'D LOVE THE CHANCE
TO WORK WITH A REAL DIRECTOR.

25:49.083 --> 25:50.458
LATER...

25:50.458 --> 25:52.125
IF WE EVER
GET OUT OF HERE.

25:52.125 --> 25:53.667
YOU GOT IT.

25:58.708 --> 26:01.208
HERE'S THE GRASSY KNOLL HERE,
AND THIS IS ELM.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.333
NOW, IF OSWALD
WAS HERE--

26:02.333 --> 26:04.542
YOU ACTUALLY BUY INTO
THAT MAGIC BULLET THEORY?

26:04.542 --> 26:06.000
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

26:06.000 --> 26:09.125
ARE YOU SAYING THAT EVERY ONE
ON THE WARREN COMMISSION LIED?

26:09.125 --> 26:11.166
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT KEVIN COSTNER

26:11.166 --> 26:13.083
WAS PRETTY CONVINCING
IN JFK.

26:13.083 --> 26:16.208
I MEAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE
ACTUALLY READ THE REPORT.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.542
ISN'T IT LIKE
A MILLION PAGES?

26:17.542 --> 26:20.083
CURIOUS.

26:20.083 --> 26:21.041
THERE'S CURIOUS,

26:21.041 --> 26:24.583
AND THEN THERE'S
SAND MODELS OF DALLAS.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.792
HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT
MY UFO THEORIES?

26:26.792 --> 26:27.375
YOUR WHAT?

26:27.375 --> 26:30.125
MY UFO THEORIES--

26:30.125 --> 26:32.542
HOW THEY SWOOP DOWN
SOMETIMES,

26:32.542 --> 26:35.000
DESTROYING ENTIRE CITIES.

26:36.208 --> 26:39.542
NO, YOU DON'T.

26:41.041 --> 26:43.583
IT'S JUST DALLAS, HOME
OF ROSS PEROT AND THE COWBOYS.

26:43.583 --> 26:45.708
NO ONE'S
GOING TO MISS IT.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.542
LOOK AT THE TIME.
I-- I'VE GOT TO GO.

26:54.542 --> 26:56.625
MY PARENTS
ARE EXPECTING ME.

26:58.583 --> 26:59.959
IS THAT THE TRUTH,

26:59.959 --> 27:04.000
OR ARE YOU JUST TRYING TO WIGGLE
OUT OF A ROMANTIC SITUATION?

27:06.583 --> 27:08.208
I'M SORRY.

27:08.208 --> 27:10.041
LET'S GET
CINDERELLA HOME.

27:21.792 --> 27:25.959
TODAY WAS A LOT OF FUN,
ANDERSON, BUT...

27:28.125 --> 27:29.458
YOU NEED TO KNOW
THE TRUTH.

27:29.458 --> 27:32.375
AND THAT WOULD BE...?

27:35.125 --> 27:37.542
I'M NOT CINDERELLA.

27:37.542 --> 27:39.583
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

27:45.625 --> 27:47.542
NELLIE: BACKGROUND ACTION!

27:47.542 --> 27:48.583
IN SLATE GIRL.

27:50.083 --> 27:52.125
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
THIS IS IT.

27:52.125 --> 27:54.000
THIS IS THE SHOT.
I CAN FEEL IT.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.417
AND...

27:55.417 --> 27:56.708
ACTION!

27:56.708 --> 27:58.583
JOHN, DON'T THINK OF IT
AS A FOOTBALL TEAM.

27:58.583 --> 27:59.375
YOU HAVE TO THINK OF IT
AS A FAMILY.

27:59.375 --> 28:01.500
WELL, HOW SO, TIM?

28:01.500 --> 28:02.542
CUT!

28:02.542 --> 28:03.834
SORRY.

28:03.834 --> 28:04.917
SORRY.
LET'S GO AGAIN.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.583
AH, THE MAGIC OF FILMMAKING.

28:06.583 --> 28:07.583
PACEY.

28:07.583 --> 28:09.166
NELLIE: WHAT'S LOSER FRIEND
DOING HERE?

28:09.166 --> 28:10.166
GET OUT OF THAT THING.

28:10.166 --> 28:11.708
I WAS JUST
KEEPING IT WARM.

28:11.708 --> 28:15.708
CLIFF, SWEETIE,
IT'S NOT WORKING.

28:15.708 --> 28:18.333
I KNOW YOU WANT THIS
MOVING TRACKING THING,

28:18.333 --> 28:20.750
BUT CAN'T WE JUST USE
THE TRIPOD FOR THIS ONE?

28:20.750 --> 28:22.667
HEY, GUYS,
JUST LET ME DO IT.

28:22.667 --> 28:25.125
LOOK, DAWSON,
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU!

28:25.125 --> 28:25.959
WHOA! WAIT A SECOND.

28:25.959 --> 28:29.542
YOU GOT AN IDEA,
LET'S HEAR IT.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.041
I'M OPEN.

28:31.041 --> 28:33.041
CLIFF: AND...ACTION!

28:33.041 --> 28:35.542
JOHN, YOU CAN'T THINK OF IT
AS A FOOTBALL TEAM.

28:35.542 --> 28:37.458
YOU HAVE TO THINK OF IT
AS A FAMILY.

28:37.458 --> 28:38.500
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.750
THAT'S WHAT I CALL
MINUTEMAN PRIDE.

28:39.750 --> 28:41.542
LET'S GO GET THEM,
BROTHER.

28:41.542 --> 28:42.625
YEAH!
YEAH!

28:42.625 --> 28:45.792
CUT! CUT!
GREAT! PERFECT!

28:45.792 --> 28:46.375
PERFECT!

28:46.375 --> 28:50.000
[APPLAUSE]

28:57.125 --> 28:58.583
YOU WERE BRILLIANT
TODAY.

28:58.583 --> 29:01.000
YOU REALLY PUT THAT NELLIE OLSON
RIGHT IN HER PLACE.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.417
THANK YOU. THE REAL FILMING
IS YET TO COME.

29:03.417 --> 29:04.708
HELLO.

29:04.708 --> 29:06.208
WHAT CAN I GET YOU GUYS
THIS EVENING?

29:06.208 --> 29:08.291
WE'LL HAVE TWO TURKEY CLUBS
AND TWO COKES.

29:08.291 --> 29:10.250
NO MAYO ON MINE.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.208
CAN I SUGGEST BODIE'S OWN
FAT-FREE HERB SAUCE?

29:12.208 --> 29:13.291
IT'S GREAT
WITH THE CLUB.

29:13.291 --> 29:14.417
SOLD.

29:14.417 --> 29:17.041
UH, SANDWICHES TO GO,
COKES WHILE WE WAIT.

29:17.041 --> 29:18.166
WE'RE CATCHING
MAGIC HOUR TONIGHT.

29:18.166 --> 29:19.417
THE RUINS, REMEMBER?

29:19.417 --> 29:22.208
OH, YEAH.
I'LL PUT A RUSH ON IT.

29:22.208 --> 29:24.041
WHAT HAS GOTTEN
INTO JOEY?

29:24.041 --> 29:26.083
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S BIZARRE.

29:26.083 --> 29:27.375
YOU WERE LATE.

29:27.375 --> 29:31.667
LOOK, I'M IN CHARGE UNTIL YOU'RE
18 OR DAD GETS PAROLED,

29:31.667 --> 29:33.583
WHATEVER COMES FIRST.

29:33.583 --> 29:36.041
AND WE HAVE TO HELP
EACH OTHER OUT, JOEY.

29:36.041 --> 29:36.959
THAT'S JUST
THE WAY IT HAS TO BE.

29:36.959 --> 29:39.208
I'M SORRY.
RUIN MY GOOD MOOD.

29:39.208 --> 29:42.000
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HAVE A MOMENT OF HAPPINESS

29:42.000 --> 29:45.083
IN AN OTHERWISE
PATHETIC EXISTENCE.

29:45.083 --> 29:46.917
YOU CAN RELATE,
CAN'T YOU?

29:53.542 --> 29:54.959
WHAT IS IT?

29:56.542 --> 29:57.959
UH, NOTHING.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.792
MIND IF I JOIN YOU?
I'M ON BREAK.

30:01.792 --> 30:03.959
SURE.
SURE.

30:09.125 --> 30:10.041
WHO'S THAT?
NOBODY.

30:10.041 --> 30:11.250
WELL, HE'S KIND
OF A CUTE NOBODY.

30:11.250 --> 30:13.875
WHO?

30:13.875 --> 30:15.417
HEY, DEBORAH.
HI.

30:15.417 --> 30:17.583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
TO MEET YOUR PARENTS.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.500
WHO'S DEBORAH?

30:19.500 --> 30:20.583
SHE'S DEBORAH.

30:20.583 --> 30:23.417
NO, SHE'S NOT.

30:23.417 --> 30:24.708
OH...SHE'S NOT?

30:24.708 --> 30:28.125
WELL, THEN WHO DID I SPEND
THE AFTERNOON WITH?

30:28.125 --> 30:29.208
AN IMPOSTOR?

30:29.208 --> 30:31.625
IT'S JUST THAT, UH,
WE DON'T CALL HER DEBORAH.

30:31.625 --> 30:34.291
SHE'S JUST "DEB" TO US.

30:34.291 --> 30:37.250
OH. ARE YOU GUYS
FROM NEW YORK, AS WELL?

30:37.250 --> 30:39.041
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

30:39.041 --> 30:41.500
JEN: UH, YEAH. WE'RE JUST
PASSING THROUGH, THOUGH.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.000
DEB AND I GO
TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.

30:43.000 --> 30:43.417
AND YOU ARE?

30:43.417 --> 30:45.166
ANDERSON.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.500
DEBORAH AND I WENT
SAILING TODAY.

30:46.500 --> 30:47.834
AH.
OH.

30:47.834 --> 30:49.166
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO JOIN US,

30:49.166 --> 30:52.250
DEB'S FRIEND
WHO WE'VE NEVER MET, EVER?

30:52.250 --> 30:54.375
UH, I'M GOING
TO GET A TAKEOUT.

30:54.375 --> 30:54.959
SANDWICHES UP.

30:59.208 --> 31:02.375
YOU KNOW, ANDERSON,
THE FOOD'S GOOD HERE,

31:02.375 --> 31:04.542
BUT THE SERVICE
IS A LITTLE IFFY.

31:04.542 --> 31:06.166
YOU THINK YOUR PARENTS MIGHT
FREE YOU UP TONIGHT?

31:06.166 --> 31:08.542
I DON'T KNOW...BIG FAMILY
SCRABBLE TOURNAMENT TONIGHT.

31:08.542 --> 31:11.250
HEY, JOEY.

31:11.250 --> 31:12.291
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO SNEAK AWAY LATER.

31:12.291 --> 31:13.834
OKAY. WELL, YOU KNOW
WHERE I'LL BE.

31:13.834 --> 31:17.542
PLANET EARTH TO JOEY!

31:17.542 --> 31:19.083
I'LL COME BY
AFTER THE GAME.

31:19.083 --> 31:21.375
HEY, "CHARADE" IS
A GOOD SEVEN-LETTER WORD

31:21.375 --> 31:23.750
YOU CAN USE
IN THAT SCRABBLE GAME.

31:25.750 --> 31:29.500
MUST'VE COME RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.583
HERE YOU GO.

31:30.583 --> 31:32.875
THAT'S 7.50.

31:34.166 --> 31:37.708
MISS, WOULD YOU, UH,
WOULD YOU LIKE ANYTHING?

31:37.708 --> 31:40.875
NO, BUT THANK YOU.

31:40.875 --> 31:42.458
ANYTIME.

IT'S INCREDIBLE.

33:43.166 --> 33:44.792
IT'S PART OF SOME
GUY'S ESTATE.

33:44.792 --> 33:47.792
HE BUILT IT FOR HIS
DEAD WIFE-- BEFORE SHE DIED.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.792
SHE LOVED GREECE.
IT WAS HER FAVORITE SPOT.

33:49.792 --> 33:52.250
AND THEN SHE GOT SICK
AND COULDN'T TRAVEL ANYMORE,

33:52.250 --> 33:54.542
SO HE BROUGHT
GREECE TO HER.

33:54.542 --> 33:56.000
THAT IS SO ROMANTIC.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.083
YEAH?

33:57.083 --> 33:58.458
I THINK SO.

34:07.667 --> 34:10.333

ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.
