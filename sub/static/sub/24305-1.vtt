01:20.280 --> 01:21.588
Go now!

01:28.588 --> 01:29.964
Stay put.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.441
Here you go.

01:46.539 --> 01:47.915
One more.

01:53.046 --> 01:58.052
- Virgil?
- No. It's Dr. Jenkins.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.823
You get some rest.

02:01.521 --> 02:04.365
I'll leave you that bottle
but you go easy on it.

02:09.762 --> 02:11.969
I'll bring the priest in a few days.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.790
Son of a bitch.

06:46.372 --> 06:48.442
I don't know what to name that one.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.696
God.

07:10.797 --> 07:12.503
Son of a bitch.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.469
Yeah.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.907
I gotta get out of here.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.256
When I...

09:43.482 --> 09:44.892
Motherfucker.

11:20.079 --> 11:21.580
<i>Taylon.</i>

13:04.283 --> 13:06.786
<i>You look like a rotten weed.</i>

13:12.491 --> 13:15.233
- What?
- You heard me, Taylon.

13:15.394 --> 13:17.134
You're a rotten weed.

13:20.866 --> 13:22.208
Virgil?

13:22.668 --> 13:24.010
Of course.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.079
Now put that misfiring piece of shit away.

13:27.706 --> 13:29.845
But I... thought...

13:30.709 --> 13:32.085
You thought what?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.160
Nothing.

13:43.422 --> 13:44.798
My Lord.

13:48.694 --> 13:51.902
It's all mine. Yeah.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.410
How's Tantrum?

13:58.671 --> 14:01.694
She's the best horse north of the Mexicans.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.277
That's good. Still ride him?

14:04.410 --> 14:07.652
No, I walk him. That's all.

14:14.653 --> 14:17.565
Doctor tells me I'm at the end of my trail.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.837
I think he's right.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.439
But I am not going out like this.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.269
Not a chance. Not here.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.471
So? What'll it be?

14:34.206 --> 14:36.049
I'm thinking about a bank.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.949
A particular bank, I'm assuming.

14:45.117 --> 14:47.324
Yeah. The very one.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.437
But we need to do it right this time.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.508
Jake still there?

15:11.210 --> 15:12.586
Well, all right, then.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.992
Gonna put up in the barn tonight.

15:16.348 --> 15:18.293
Get some eggs going at sunup.

15:19.118 --> 15:20.494
I'll cook them.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.463
I miss him.

17:20.138 --> 17:21.845
What you doing, old man?

17:22.574 --> 17:24.212
Trying to kill yourself?

17:25.344 --> 17:27.050
Why don't you give me a minute?

17:27.945 --> 17:31.256
Give me a chance
to get myself cleaned up here.

17:34.753 --> 17:37.392
- You sure you're up for this?
- No.

17:39.792 --> 17:40.963
No.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.665
I'm sure it's a bad idea.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.502
But I'm going anyway.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.051
Good enough for me.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.962
Oh, yeah.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.260
One bullet, huh?

19:22.327 --> 19:24.483
Save the last bullet for yourself.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.667
Well, then, you better not waste it.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.771
I ain't gonna waste it.

19:31.603 --> 19:34.083
So, we doing this today?

19:51.590 --> 19:53.091
You okay in there?

20:00.465 --> 20:01.636
Yep.

20:16.415 --> 20:19.589
- I got plenty of money.
- Take them.

20:29.761 --> 20:31.467
It's gonna be dark soon.

21:07.165 --> 21:08.507
Okay.

21:22.414 --> 21:24.826
Here, come on. There.

21:26.385 --> 21:28.262
That's good. That's good.

21:40.065 --> 21:41.441
We doing this?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.429
Come on, man,
you can't take that tree with us.

21:50.509 --> 21:51.851
Let's go.

21:55.247 --> 21:59.422
Now, if you fall off that horse, we're
gonna have a big problem, you know that.

21:59.918 --> 22:02.455
Don't start. Let's go.

22:21.473 --> 22:24.146
- Wanna race?
- That's far enough.

22:44.763 --> 22:45.934
Whoa.

22:46.665 --> 22:48.007
Something wrong?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.109
Yeah, I forgot something.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.476
What?

22:58.977 --> 23:01.252
What, like your damn mind?

23:07.018 --> 23:09.122
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

23:23.435 --> 23:24.777
Let's go.

23:31.977 --> 23:33.581
Won't waste it, huh?

23:34.079 --> 23:35.033
What?

23:35.113 --> 23:37.855
I thought you were saving
the last one for yourself.

23:38.383 --> 23:40.192
What were you shooting at?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.695
I put a bullet into that tree.

23:47.292 --> 23:48.771
Did you hit it?

23:49.461 --> 23:51.133
You're damn straight I did.

23:52.497 --> 23:53.668
Well,

23:54.633 --> 23:58.490
looks like you did a hell
of a lot more than shoot one tree.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.344
Yeah, I burned it down.

24:01.306 --> 24:02.978
Oh, good Lord, Taylon.

24:07.879 --> 24:09.517
I burned it all down.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.685
The whole damn ranch?

24:19.991 --> 24:22.948
- The whole damn thing?
- Well, it got out of hand.

24:23.028 --> 24:25.770
- It what?
- The fire got out of hand.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.855
I mean, I didn't mean to burn down
the ranch, for God's sake.

24:29.935 --> 24:32.381
If I need more bullets,
I'll get them from you.

24:33.104 --> 24:35.060
Like hell you will, old man.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.517
I feel it's better this way
that you ain't got any.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.085
I feel safer.

24:42.280 --> 24:45.693
The whole damn thing. The whole damn thing?

24:46.084 --> 24:51.693
I tried to chop it down but I'm getting
too old for that damn nonsense.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.067
I hope you're having fun.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.438
The whole damn thing.

24:58.096 --> 24:59.267
Come on.

25:00.265 --> 25:02.335
Go, go. Let's go.

25:03.535 --> 25:05.173
Just follow the light.

25:07.072 --> 25:08.560
Wait, wait, where you going?

25:08.640 --> 25:11.313
- Durango's this way.
- Going to Hesperus first.

25:11.476 --> 25:12.886
What? Why?

25:13.411 --> 25:16.118
Personal business. You coming?

25:16.648 --> 25:17.819
Come on.

25:18.116 --> 25:19.617
I won't miss it.

25:20.986 --> 25:22.328
All right.

26:39.397 --> 26:40.841
Hey, Tantrum.

26:51.676 --> 26:53.849
Your friend crossed a while ago!

27:00.952 --> 27:04.042
- What?
- Your friend, crossed a while ago.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.657
Thought you'd wanna know.

27:22.173 --> 27:23.674
How long ago?

27:25.477 --> 27:26.978
Can't rightly say.

27:28.213 --> 27:29.384
Well.

27:45.330 --> 27:50.035
I don't remember crossing any creek
on that trail from Hesperus.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.110
Water's change.

27:54.239 --> 27:56.742
- So does the need to cross.
- Huh?

27:58.143 --> 28:00.020
Just saying what I'm saying.

28:00.712 --> 28:02.486
Whoa, whoa.

28:03.648 --> 28:04.819
What?

28:05.417 --> 28:07.794
- You got to pay me.
- What?

28:08.253 --> 28:09.641
You got to pay me.

28:09.721 --> 28:12.360
I ain't paying you to cross no creek.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.029
Well...

28:15.894 --> 28:18.237
then you're not crossing this creek.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.467
Maybe we got lost last night.

28:24.402 --> 28:26.758
- I guess I'll just go around.
- Now look,

28:26.838 --> 28:29.409
now you wanna get away from that place...

28:30.909 --> 28:35.050
to get to that place, you got to cross.

28:35.847 --> 28:40.193
There's no other way to get from over there

28:41.019 --> 28:43.055
to that place over there.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.262
You got to pay me.

28:45.990 --> 28:47.525
Did Virgil pay you?

28:49.961 --> 28:53.738
Everybody pays. Now, coins will do fine.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.584
They're no use to you.

29:10.982 --> 29:12.688
They're only good for crossing.

29:17.655 --> 29:21.000
- You hungry?
- No. No.

29:21.559 --> 29:22.935
Yeah, you are.

29:39.744 --> 29:41.154
That's not funny.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.036
Oh, Lord.

29:57.862 --> 29:59.033
All right.

30:04.402 --> 30:05.903
Y'all get along now.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.657
Taylon!

30:24.856 --> 30:26.699
You have a good nap, old man?

30:27.158 --> 30:30.161
Damn, you're slow.
I had to double back for you.

30:30.528 --> 30:32.507
Where the hell are we, Virg?

30:33.097 --> 30:34.940
On the road to Hesperus.

30:35.266 --> 30:37.422
I don't remember any creek
on the way to Hesperus.

30:37.502 --> 30:38.673
Creek?

30:40.238 --> 30:41.760
There ain't no damn creek.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.596
- We're in the desert, Taylon.
- Yeah, that old river rat!

30:44.676 --> 30:46.485
He just... He st...

30:48.346 --> 30:51.588
I gave him the coins that you gave me.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.155
So, I could cross the creek.

30:57.021 --> 31:00.001
- He take them?
- Yeah, he took them.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.570
- Both of them?
- Yeah.

31:04.929 --> 31:06.965
- All right then.
- Shit.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.445
- Storm's coming.
- Best get going.

31:11.636 --> 31:13.274
See what you're made of, Taylon.

31:15.673 --> 31:17.208
Don't tempt me.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.626
Heidi, you in here?

32:15.700 --> 32:18.476
Taylon, what you doing out in this?

32:19.070 --> 32:21.209
What the hell you doing, Jaden?

32:21.973 --> 32:24.214
I'm just giving a new pony a ride.

32:26.210 --> 32:27.799
Where's Sam?

32:27.879 --> 32:29.834
He died last spring.

32:29.914 --> 32:31.449
You can talk to me.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.794
I'm the new proprietor of this establishment.

32:35.253 --> 32:36.595
Where's Heidi?

32:38.556 --> 32:42.401
- You... How long you stabling him for?
- I asked you a question.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.117
Well, she's around here somewhere.

32:46.197 --> 32:48.540
I'll tell her you're looking for her.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.780
Can I get you a room?

32:53.037 --> 32:56.541
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna need your pistol.

32:57.275 --> 32:59.152
I'm gonna need your rifle.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.011
That ain't gonna happen.

33:02.213 --> 33:05.403
No one takes my guns off of me, nobody.

33:05.483 --> 33:10.489
You can't stay in Hesperus
because new sheriff, new rules.

33:11.789 --> 33:16.014
I'm gonna need it before I can give you
the key, and you can't stay in Hesperus

33:16.094 --> 33:17.615
if you don't do it.

33:17.695 --> 33:23.175
The only reason I'm gonna give you
my gun is I came here to see Heidi.

33:24.202 --> 33:25.737
Make that happen.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.245
Well, I'll arrange that.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.116
You all right?

34:05.243 --> 34:06.949
A bottle of your best.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.960
Wanna dance?

34:18.156 --> 34:19.862
No, no.

34:34.272 --> 34:35.773
Tall glass.

34:56.460 --> 34:57.632
Yeah.

35:26.757 --> 35:28.497
God damn piano.

35:30.294 --> 35:32.569
Piano, it's like tinky-tinky.

35:39.837 --> 35:41.441
Have you seen my friend yet?

35:43.708 --> 35:45.710
He's probably upstairs with a whore.

35:46.410 --> 35:49.152
You know, this is the only place to stay, so.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.732
You all right, mister?

36:06.931 --> 36:09.001
- Where's Heidi?
- Sam's daughter?

36:09.467 --> 36:12.072
She's probably upstairs working.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.210
What do you mean working?

36:14.372 --> 36:17.876
Jade put her to work here
right after Sam passed.

36:21.445 --> 36:22.787
Where?

36:28.886 --> 36:30.695
That son of a bitch.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.800
Where's my gun?

37:18.569 --> 37:19.740
No.

37:26.377 --> 37:28.379
You looking for your guns?

37:30.281 --> 37:33.785
- Give them back, Virgil. I need them.
- Calm down.

37:34.185 --> 37:36.255
They took them from you last night.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.296
Who's got them?

37:38.689 --> 37:40.031
Don't know.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.661
You have a fun night?

37:45.329 --> 37:47.552
I didn't think you were up
for something like that.

37:47.632 --> 37:51.722
No, I wasn't. Who were you with last night?

37:51.802 --> 37:54.043
- Some girl.
- A redhead?

37:54.138 --> 37:56.777
Nope. Why?

37:58.376 --> 38:01.447
Why are we here? Let's get going.

38:02.580 --> 38:05.822
- I gotta give her something.
- Give who what?

38:06.450 --> 38:07.792
Heidi.

38:11.889 --> 38:14.301
Why don't you just tell her
she's your daughter?

38:16.861 --> 38:19.136
I've been trying for 20 years.

38:20.431 --> 38:22.205
Can't find the words.

38:26.737 --> 38:28.079
Look...

38:29.307 --> 38:31.343
I find out she's whoring.

38:33.844 --> 38:35.186
And...

38:37.048 --> 38:39.357
I need some time to figure it out.

38:43.954 --> 38:47.867
Well... I can't stay.

38:48.926 --> 38:51.303
They don't like me much in this town and...

38:53.497 --> 38:55.408
I've already had my dance.

38:57.501 --> 38:58.911
Tell you what.

39:00.604 --> 39:02.674
How about I go on ahead,

39:03.374 --> 39:06.218
- scout out the bank?
- Do that.

39:07.611 --> 39:10.216
Good. Glad you agree.

39:12.483 --> 39:15.172
Don't you go dying before we get to Durango.

39:15.252 --> 39:17.823
Go on, get. I got... I gotta get some sleep.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.141
Eat your peas, son.

39:51.989 --> 39:55.562
Hurry up, hurry up! We gotta get laid
before we get outta them whores.

39:55.760 --> 39:58.683
- Damn right.
- I haven't had a poke in damn near a week.

39:58.763 --> 40:01.800
- Let's go.
- Hey, fellas!

40:03.300 --> 40:06.610
We got youngins and a lady here with us.

40:10.007 --> 40:11.918
You boys look new to Durango.

40:12.209 --> 40:14.882
Hell, we are, we just come down
from the mine.

40:17.014 --> 40:20.154
- Who's the old man trying to hush us?
- That there's our sheriff.

40:20.684 --> 40:22.356
Will McMullen's his name.

40:24.355 --> 40:26.198
Used to be a Texas Ranger.

40:27.992 --> 40:31.473
You don't say. A real-life Texas Ranger?

40:32.029 --> 40:34.509
Well, hell. I gotta meet him.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.534
Take it easy, now.

40:37.635 --> 40:40.775
Hey. Hey.

40:41.539 --> 40:43.746
What part of Texas you used to ranger?

40:46.477 --> 40:48.081
The whole state.

40:48.646 --> 40:51.422
Lived in San Antonio if that's what you mean.

40:52.850 --> 40:55.660
Hey, Tommy. You from them parts.

40:55.953 --> 40:58.524
You ever hear of a Ranger
named Will McMullen?

40:59.557 --> 41:00.728
Nope.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.738
Just wanted you to watch
your language, that's all.

41:06.630 --> 41:09.201
I think the old Ranger is threatening you.

41:13.571 --> 41:15.175
Watch yourself now.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.429
- That right, old man?
- Yeah.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.454
- You threatening me?
- Mm-hmm.

41:21.245 --> 41:24.658
Ma'am, I will cover your dinner,

41:25.282 --> 41:27.905
while you get your children out of here now.

41:27.985 --> 41:30.829
Let's go. Thank you, Sheriff.

41:31.689 --> 41:33.133
Go on, get.

41:37.294 --> 41:40.206
All right, you take it easy, partner.
I got a drink here.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.445
Damn, that steak looks good.

41:51.141 --> 41:53.120
Welcome to town, fellas.

41:53.544 --> 41:55.580
It's a peaceful little town.

41:56.046 --> 42:00.824
Sure, we got gentlemen that like to kick
the stink around from time to time.

42:01.519 --> 42:05.694
But not while the sun's up.
Not around youngins. Not around women.

42:07.725 --> 42:12.183
So, if you abide by the rules,
I'll be willing to forget about all this.

42:12.263 --> 42:14.952
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

42:15.032 --> 42:16.374
What about you?

42:17.001 --> 42:18.343
Okay, sure.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.550
Enjoy.

42:31.415 --> 42:33.019
Now, you boys have fun tonight.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.398
Giovanni.

42:43.060 --> 42:47.167
You make sure that they're fed and watered.

42:47.431 --> 42:49.376
- There you go.
- Much obliged, sheriff.

42:55.372 --> 42:58.785
Y'all ever talk about my past life again...

42:59.810 --> 43:01.289
I'll kill you both.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.050
- Understood?
- Yeah.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.228
- Hmm?
- Yes.

43:12.690 --> 43:14.169
Good day, gentlemen.

43:26.036 --> 43:29.073
- You have my back, huh?
- You screwed it up.

43:53.297 --> 43:54.468
Will.

43:56.233 --> 43:58.756
- What now?
- That feller out on the ranch,

43:58.836 --> 44:01.543
you told me to let you know
if anything changed and...

44:02.206 --> 44:04.811
He's taken a turn these past few weeks.

44:04.942 --> 44:07.319
Thought he'd pass
when I saw him the other day.

44:08.045 --> 44:10.501
- How long?
- It's hard to say, really.

44:10.581 --> 44:13.721
I told him I'd bring
the priest out in few days.

44:14.785 --> 44:16.264
All right, then.

44:16.754 --> 44:18.096
All right.

44:18.689 --> 44:23.165
And he was mumbling something
about a... it was a fella named Virgil.

44:30.234 --> 44:33.214
Just... rambling, I guess.

44:34.938 --> 44:36.280
Well, I'm sorry, Will.

44:37.241 --> 44:39.516
Sorry? He ain't no friend of mine.

44:40.577 --> 44:43.216
All right then, Doc, you let me
know when he's passed.

44:43.747 --> 44:45.988
Will do. You have a good day.

44:50.421 --> 44:56.132
<i>Wait till the darkness is over</i>

44:57.227 --> 45:02.802
<i>Wait till the tempest is done</i>

45:05.169 --> 45:12.109
<i>Hope that the sun shines tomorrow</i>

45:13.210 --> 45:20.184
<i>After the darkness is gone</i>

45:23.487 --> 45:25.466
Finally amongst the living.

45:32.696 --> 45:35.005
Heard you were asking for me last night.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.079
Sorry, I didn't show.

45:44.508 --> 45:45.850
Well...

45:49.079 --> 45:52.116
Were you with my friend Virgil last night?

45:52.483 --> 45:54.428
You weren't with him, were you?

45:55.285 --> 45:56.627
No.

45:58.422 --> 45:59.764
Honestly...

46:01.158 --> 46:04.503
I was surprised when Jaden
told me you wanted me.

46:05.496 --> 46:06.872
Wanted you?

46:07.998 --> 46:09.807
What the hell are you doing?

46:10.868 --> 46:12.278
Nothing, I just...

46:13.504 --> 46:16.883
thought I should clean up
for you before we get to it.

46:19.176 --> 46:20.848
Isn't that why you're here?

46:26.383 --> 46:27.759
Yeah, well...

46:29.286 --> 46:32.323
I just wanted to come see you.

46:32.689 --> 46:34.395
Hey, well, you're seeing me.

46:34.491 --> 46:36.732
Yeah, and you're all grown up.

46:38.295 --> 46:39.933
You're a woman now...

46:42.466 --> 46:44.206
and I missed it all.

46:49.473 --> 46:52.078
I didn't come to see you as a whore.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.888
What right have you to say that?

47:04.888 --> 47:06.958
Look, if...

47:08.192 --> 47:10.831
if you're not here for a poke,
then you need to go.

47:14.064 --> 47:19.843
I'm sorry, look, I just...
My head's not... working right.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.245
Will you put some clothes on?

47:25.242 --> 47:27.517
Put some clothes, please?

47:30.714 --> 47:33.626
Jaden hates it when
I ain't making money. So...

47:34.918 --> 47:36.727
if you aren't here for me.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.668
What are you here for?

47:43.894 --> 47:45.236
Look...

47:53.637 --> 47:56.845
Is this enough to get me through
to tomorrow morning?

47:57.274 --> 47:59.617
- Right there.
- Yeah, yeah, sure is.

47:59.843 --> 48:01.014
Good.

48:02.112 --> 48:04.401
I need you to tell me where my gun is.

48:04.481 --> 48:07.359
Jaden locks up everybody's guns
until they leave.

48:09.753 --> 48:12.576
And where is he hiding under,
that son of a bitch,

48:12.656 --> 48:14.396
under some kind of rock?

48:15.325 --> 48:18.305
I don't know. But he ain't here.

48:18.996 --> 48:22.170
Yeah, right, well, I am gonna kill him.

48:23.100 --> 48:26.445
Well, what rock is that son of a bitch under?

48:28.472 --> 48:29.643
Hey.

48:30.507 --> 48:32.384
I am gonna kill him.

48:33.677 --> 48:36.487
As sure as the sun rises in the morning.

48:40.284 --> 48:41.626
You okay?

49:09.413 --> 49:10.983
You don't look so good.

49:18.956 --> 49:20.958
I'll just lay down for a bit, then.

49:58.595 --> 50:00.096
What you doing, Henry?

50:00.764 --> 50:02.299
Look at that sumbitch.

50:03.867 --> 50:05.368
He ain't no Ranger.

50:05.802 --> 50:08.179
- Yeah, he is.
- No, he ain't.

50:08.872 --> 50:12.148
Ma and I were in the eating place,
and these two miners...

50:13.176 --> 50:15.246
they said that Will wasn't no Ranger.

50:17.381 --> 50:19.326
You gonna believe dirty miners?

50:19.649 --> 50:21.492
Our ma seemed to believe them.

50:24.221 --> 50:25.665
We need to find out.

50:26.156 --> 50:27.327
How?

50:30.460 --> 50:33.668
I say one of us tries to sneak
into that window...

50:34.398 --> 50:36.720
see if he's got a Ranger badge or something.

50:36.800 --> 50:39.439
You can't do that. They'll hang ya.

50:40.604 --> 50:44.142
If we find out he's an outlaw,
then they give us a reward.

50:46.276 --> 50:47.777
Well, I ain't doing it.

50:53.550 --> 50:54.892
Chickens.

50:56.119 --> 50:57.461
Fine, I'll do it.

50:59.823 --> 51:01.802
Make a hooting sound if he wakes up.

51:01.925 --> 51:05.497
- Wait, a what?
- A hoot, like this.

51:11.835 --> 51:14.941
- What's a hooting sound?
- How am I supposed to know?

51:21.111 --> 51:22.749
He's really gonna do it.

51:30.053 --> 51:32.556
- Not now.
- My ma's coming.

51:37.794 --> 51:40.017
- What in God's name are you doing?
- Nothing, Ma!

51:40.097 --> 51:41.485
- Ma, Ma, please, no!
- Ma'am.

51:41.565 --> 51:43.954
No, Ma! No, please, Ma, please!

51:44.034 --> 51:46.123
No, Ma! Ma!

51:46.203 --> 51:48.774
Sally Anne, you get your fanny
over here too now!

52:28.712 --> 52:30.521
Your bath is almost ready.

52:35.819 --> 52:39.391
I'm sorry, kid? What was that?

52:41.358 --> 52:43.667
You smell like a horse's ass.

52:44.861 --> 52:46.083
Didn't smell it in the stables,

52:46.163 --> 52:50.202
but now that we're not
surrounded by horse shit.

52:53.136 --> 52:54.307
You okay?

53:00.110 --> 53:01.987
Medicine, saddlebags.

53:05.916 --> 53:07.258
Shit.

53:10.954 --> 53:13.076
- You got a spoon?
- No, no.

53:13.156 --> 53:15.295
- Okay, okay, okay, here.
- Give me.

53:18.261 --> 53:19.432
Drink.

53:22.098 --> 53:23.440
All right, all right.

53:28.438 --> 53:29.848
Enough of this.

53:35.111 --> 53:36.612
No more of this.

53:40.317 --> 53:41.818
Your bath is ready.

53:44.354 --> 53:47.061
You don't have to be so damn modest, Taylon.

53:54.764 --> 53:56.106
I won't look.

53:58.301 --> 53:59.802
I'll get you a bottle.

54:42.178 --> 54:45.056
- Having fun?
- What the hell?

54:46.016 --> 54:48.621
I couldn't have possibly said that better.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.699
What the hell, Taylon?

54:55.125 --> 54:58.504
I thought you had a place to be.

55:00.363 --> 55:03.503
In fact, I thought we had a place to be.

55:13.109 --> 55:15.646
- You tell her yet?
- Nope.

55:17.647 --> 55:18.989
Stop.

55:23.186 --> 55:25.495
You know how long you've been here?

55:25.855 --> 55:27.265
Do you...

55:30.593 --> 55:32.367
You even know what time it is?

55:34.931 --> 55:38.310
- What does that matter?
- Two days, Taylon.

55:40.403 --> 55:43.850
You've wasted two days.

55:44.240 --> 55:48.085
- Trying to get myself together.
- Well, you look together.

55:48.945 --> 55:50.890
As much as possible, anyway.

55:51.781 --> 55:54.454
I want to take Heidi to Durango, Virg.

55:54.818 --> 55:57.093
Now, you know I can't be a part of that.

55:58.621 --> 56:00.293
I'm aware of that.

56:01.491 --> 56:03.732
I'll see you there, promise.

56:03.893 --> 56:05.235
Fine.

56:07.464 --> 56:09.034
But what's your plan with her?

56:09.432 --> 56:12.936
I'm gonna get her out
of this Godforsaken place.

56:16.072 --> 56:17.414
Okay.

56:18.975 --> 56:20.476
But don't you forget...

56:21.311 --> 56:23.085
we have a bank to rob.

56:24.914 --> 56:26.518
I know we did.

56:29.552 --> 56:32.794
Not until I found out she was whoring.

56:33.022 --> 56:36.401
Whoring, Virg. Just give me a day.

56:37.594 --> 56:38.936
All right.

56:40.463 --> 56:41.907
I'll head back.

56:43.333 --> 56:45.073
But I won't wait long.

56:45.969 --> 56:48.881
And if I have to come back for you, Taylon...

56:53.042 --> 56:55.886
I will not be happy.

56:57.814 --> 56:59.850
I'll meet you there, I promise.

57:00.283 --> 57:01.625
I'll be there.

57:02.018 --> 57:03.553
See you then and there.

57:38.354 --> 57:41.357
You fucking him or feeding him?

57:45.462 --> 57:46.872
That old man...

57:49.365 --> 57:52.277
don't look like he could handle
a girl like you.

57:53.970 --> 57:55.779
It's not like that.

57:58.274 --> 57:59.753
He's a gentleman.

58:03.646 --> 58:04.988
Well...

58:12.355 --> 58:13.890
gentleman or not...

58:17.594 --> 58:19.630
he owes for your time.

58:20.129 --> 58:22.370
- He's good for it.
- Yeah.

58:26.803 --> 58:28.714
Better be good enough to...

58:32.008 --> 58:33.646
cover room and board.

58:36.913 --> 58:38.551
Well, he's got enough.

58:51.361 --> 58:52.896
You'll get paid.

59:16.319 --> 59:19.561
My God, Taylon, I think you've been
in there long enough.

59:21.257 --> 59:23.430
Can't tell if you're pruning or aging.

59:24.394 --> 59:25.770
Yeah.

59:39.709 --> 59:41.051
All right.

59:47.283 --> 59:48.625
Here you go.

59:51.554 --> 59:53.226
- Cheers.
- Cheers to you.

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:12.916
So...

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:18.314
You still an outlaw?

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:22.125
Yep. Always.

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:27.832
You still riding Tantrum?

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.134
Yeah, always.

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:33.537
How's...

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:37.638
- was it Thistle? What is it?
- Twitch.

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:39.209
How's Twig?

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.511
- His name's Twitch.
- Yeah.

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:47.254
An absolute tear. Fat.

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:52.258
He eats his weight in hay hourly.

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:53.519
But...

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:56.691
he's all I got, so.

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:00.330
I love him.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:07.130
You know, you like working with the horses
so much down there, why did you ever stop?

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:10.107
Still do.

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:12.809
But...

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:16.481
after Dad got shot...

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.446
Jaden wouldn't let me work
the stables no more, and...

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:21.919
Shot?

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:24.483
Yeah.

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:33.295
Wait a minute, Jaden told me that he died...

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.467
he died passed in the spring.

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.235
Yeah, he did.

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:41.674
'Cause of the bullet to the back.

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:45.035
Well, who shot him? Who shot him?

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:47.857
- Taylon.
- Who shot him?

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.108
Taylon.

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:53.053
Taylon! Taylon? What's wrong?

01:01:53.176 --> 01:01:55.164
- What's wrong?
- Medicine. Medicine.

01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:56.415
One second.

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:01.389
Medicine.

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:05.993
<i>Wait... Wait, Virg!</i>

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:12.236
Wait, Virg! No!

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:17.039
No! No, no...

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:20.323
No, wait! Virg! No!

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:23.145
Here, just one sip. Come on, come on.

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.793
Okay. Okay.

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:39.058
Okay.

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:41.558
Okay, you're good.

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:44.668
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.536
You scared the hell out of me.

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:07.491
Hey, Will!

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:12.141
Something unusual about
that fella out on the ranch.

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.710
What the hell's going on?

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.244
Well, don't know, really.

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:18.627
Brought out his medicine and Father
Murphy, but the place was burnt.

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:21.733
Burnt? What do you mean burnt?

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:23.920
Just that. Nothing much left of the ranch.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.376
Burned down.

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.323
What about the man? What happened to the man?

01:03:27.403 --> 01:03:29.625
Don't know, I mean, we searched
pretty hard for the body.

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.184
We didn't find anything.

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:36.823
No remains. His horse was gone, too, Will.

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:42.405
How long ago?

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.273
Just now. Came straight to you.

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:46.476
No, how long ago did the fire start?

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:48.399
Oh, that? I don't know that.

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:58.108
Why you so concerned about this fella, Will?

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:01.970
I'll be back soon.

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:18.095
Time to go.

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:35.114
You owe me for your time with Heidi.

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:38.644
Since you been here,
she hasn't been with a single man.

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:43.381
Considering she hadn't paid her due...

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:47.794
I need to be compensated for her time.

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:51.823
And I think this is gonna cover it, barely.

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:55.297
Your welcome here has extended itself.

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:59.065
But I wish you a good day, sir.

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:01.669
Let me lead you out.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.991
You looking for your rifle?

01:05:58.087 --> 01:05:59.463
Well...

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:08.371
let's do it.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.254
Get the horses!

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.955
Let's go. Let's go, come on.

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:05.759
It's time to get back to work.

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:47.636
You gonna waste a bullet on him or am I?

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:52.402
Nah. He won't make it anyway.

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.738
<i>He's dead.</i>

01:08:22.497 --> 01:08:23.942
<i>Not yet.</i>

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:34.042
<i>What's he doing acting like this?</i>

01:08:37.078 --> 01:08:38.888
<i>Your friend crossed a while ago!</i>

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.184
<i>He ain't gonna make it.</i>

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:45.430
<i>He will make it.</i>

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:53.067
<i>Everybody pays.</i>

01:08:54.095 --> 01:08:55.801
<i>Did you take him into town?</i>

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.144
<i>I built you a fire
to keep you comfortable, friend.</i>

01:09:03.005 --> 01:09:04.540
<i>God bless you.</i>

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:07.178
<i>He'll be in His good graces soon.</i>

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:11.484
<i>Abandoned everyone he loved.</i>

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.756
<i>Never should have crossed.</i>

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:20.209
<i>Even though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,</i>

01:09:20.288 --> 01:09:23.269
<i>Even though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,</i>

01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:27.029
<i>I will fear no evil.</i>

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:10.126
<i>Taylon.</i>

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:11.946
You're not there yet.

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:43.792
<i>They killed my wife, Jake.
Why'd they kill my wife?</i>

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:45.361
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>You took their money.</i>

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:48.230
<i>For God sakes, get on your horse and go.</i>

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:50.699
- <i>I ain't leaving that baby.</i>
- <i>They'll kill you and your little girl.</i>

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:52.868
- <i>I'll take care of her.</i>
- <i>You swear to God, Jake?</i>

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:55.451
<i>I swear to God.
You're no good to her dead.</i>

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:58.795
Heidi.

01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:07.901
What you doing, Heidi?

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.729
All right, come on.

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:22.720
Let's go. Let's go.

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:40.699
Whoa.

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:42.673
Brought you Tantrum.

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:50.849
I'm sorry.

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:15.232
Morning, ladies.

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:18.347
What you doing in our town
at this time, Sheriff?

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:21.100
Well, I'm looking for Jaden. You seen him?

01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:22.939
He ain't around.

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:26.608
- Out at his ranch?
- No.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.991
One of the girls ran off last night.

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.608
He's got every man
in this town hunting her down.

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:38.357
- Which one?
- Heidi.

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:43.187
She beat him pretty good, too.
Tried to burn his stable down on him.

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:48.566
Y'all happen to see an old man kind
of peaked-looking

01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:51.326
passing through town recently?

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:54.416
Yeah, he spent a couple days with Heidi,

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:57.419
and then Jaden and his men
beat him down and ran him off.

01:13:57.499 --> 01:14:00.445
- Think he's dead.
- What's going on, Sheriff?

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:05.974
Well, I'm not sure.

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:09.854
Well, we ain't earned nothing last night
due to all the men being gone.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.089
You fancy a poke?

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:16.793
Good day, ladies.

01:14:27.062 --> 01:14:29.201
Shouldn't never gone to Hesperus.

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:34.111
Don't start.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:40.677
Well, what, you gonna just sit here and die?

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:44.749
I say you get up and we go rob us a bank.

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:50.963
You know, I was gonna give her
all the money anyways... and the ranch.

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:54.130
Yeah, well...

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.412
I don't think she'll want that ranch anymore.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:57.936
Exactly.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:05.474
- You look like crap anyways.
- Thank you.

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:13.084
Hey, you, in camp! I ain't coming in.
Just looking for someone.

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:15.748
Little redhead girl. You seen her?

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:18.154
Why?

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:20.402
Well, she pistol-whipped the saloon owner

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:24.225
in Hesperus, made off
with his money and his horses.

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:27.976
- We figured her for Durango.
- We ain't seen no one!

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:29.912
Now get the hell out of our camp!

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:31.334
Shut up.

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:34.434
Yeah, I saw her.

01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:38.304
She was headed south towards Santa Fe.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.904
- Santa Fe?
- Yeah!

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:43.992
That right?

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:45.573
That's right.

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:47.284
All right.

01:15:50.412 --> 01:15:53.602
Well, we could just rob
the damn bank like I said.

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:55.092
Yeah.

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:35.110
Hey. Quit. I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:36.812
Back off. I'm keeping the money.

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:38.580
- I didn't come here for the money.
- Yeah?

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:41.350
- I was gonna give it to you anyway.
- Give it to me? Why?

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:44.353
That doesn't matter.
We gotta get you out of town.

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:46.344
Yeah, well, that's what I'm trying to do.

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:49.242
Stop it. Right now!

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:52.594
You go to that train station,
they will be looking for you there.

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:55.586
- Jaden's out for blood.
- Jaden's dead.

01:16:55.844 --> 01:16:59.723
No, Jaden's not dead. He's here in Durango.

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:05.574
I can't believe that bastard didn't die.
I mean, I smashed him good.

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:07.376
I burnt the stable down on him.

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.444
- You burnt him down?
- Yeah.

01:17:09.524 --> 01:17:10.695
Well.

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:13.004
Why are you helping me, Taylon?

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:16.466
No, I left you to die.

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:18.539
We gotta get you out of here.

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:24.126
How? I can't... I mean,
I can't outrun the posse,

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:27.186
- and I can't get on that train.
- No, you can't.

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:35.103
No, I'm dead. I'm dead.
He's... He's gonna kill me. Yeah. No, no,

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:40.530
he's gonna worse than kill me.
If Jaden gets to me, he won't let me die.

01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:42.711
- I'd rather get shot and die.
- No, no.

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:48.750
- Please, just do it! No, come on.
- You're not gonna die. Look. Give it back.

01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:50.652
- What?
- The money, give it to Jaden.

01:17:50.732 --> 01:17:53.055
Give it back to Jaden.
That's all he wanted anyway.

01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:58.812
- No, no, he'll still come after me.
- Yeah. No, he won't. I'll see to it.

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:01.852
Just give it back. Take it to the bank.

01:18:02.911 --> 01:18:05.118
- How?
- We gotta go. Come on, come on.

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:20.832
Sheriff.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.869
- Sheriff.
- What do you want, Jaden?

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:36.198
One of my whores tried to kill me.

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:38.467
Burnt down the stable and stole all my money.

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.535
I think she's hiding in your town.

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:42.924
And she did all that for no reason?

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:46.465
- Give me that!
- I need my rifle.

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:50.392
- I won't have this in my county.
- Have what?

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:54.783
Well, let's just say shooting people
in the back doesn't go over so well

01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:56.672
around these parts.

01:18:57.699 --> 01:18:59.154
I don't want her to get away.

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:01.990
Well, I don't want anyone
to get hurt, you understand?

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:03.592
She will go before the judge.

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:06.118
She tried to kill me, Will.

01:19:06.274 --> 01:19:08.096
And she may be with Taylon.

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:10.053
She did? Really?

01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:11.951
Well, I'd be real careful.

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:15.657
Yeah, you might have a bigger fight
than you even know.

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:17.726
How's that?

01:19:18.787 --> 01:19:22.860
Well, that fella she's with,
he is one mean sumbitch.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.457
I'll be with you in a moment, ma'am.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.264
How may I help you?

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:56.378
- I'd like to make a deposit.
- Okay, and your name?

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:59.097
I would like to put it
under the name of Jaden Pen...

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:04.168
Open that safe.

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:11.884
- Really?
- Taylon... is Wesley Flynn from Texas.

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:16.565
The same guy who tried
to rob our bank twenty years ago.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:19.022
- Mm-hmm.
- Whose wife got hung.

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:20.818
How long you known that?

01:20:21.616 --> 01:20:23.117
Far too long.

01:20:24.452 --> 01:20:26.329
What the hell are you doing?

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:35.503
Shut up! Shut up, whore!

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:40.569
You stay put or I'll f... I'll finish you.

01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:45.742
I'm only saying things once. Open this up.

01:20:56.551 --> 01:21:01.557
Come on out. Yeah.
Get the hell out. Go on, get.

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:11.052
Now, we know what happened to Virgil.
But what happened to the other guy?

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:12.754
What other guy? There were only two of them.

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:15.905
No, there was another guy
that rode with him in Texas.

01:21:16.004 --> 01:21:19.952
If memory serves, his name was Jake O'Malley.

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:23.331
- Well, I wouldn't know.
- You wouldn't know.

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:27.435
I thought you were a Texas Ranger.
They're from Texas.

01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:31.673
It's a big state, Texas.
There're a lot of outlaws in Texas.

01:21:31.753 --> 01:21:34.392
So I'm beginning to understand now.

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:37.135
Sheriff, you gotta hurry.

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:41.349
Roy, what... what is the matter?
You'll give yourself agita.

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:45.520
- What are you... What is the matter?
- The bank is being robbed right now!

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.055
- Damn!
- And at gunpoint!

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:49.591
- I think he's gonna kill her!
- What woman?

01:21:49.671 --> 01:21:53.628
- Tall, pretty one. Fancy dress. Red!
- What color is her hair?

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:55.710
That's the whore, sheriff!

01:21:56.444 --> 01:21:57.265
You stay... No,

01:21:57.345 --> 01:22:00.402
- you stay outta this, Jaden. No, no.
- I need the rifle. I can help you.

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:02.537
- I don't need you in this. Shut up!
- I want to help you!

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:05.607
- Shut up and get out of here!
- God!

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:08.599
Go on! Get out, go on!

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:24.173
Come on. Come on, get up. Get up.

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:30.782
Here.

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:35.971
Find a hiding place and wait till you hear
the gunshots of them coming for me,

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:40.090
but be quick 'cause that train's
gonna want to get the hell out.

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:41.756
I don't understand.

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:45.780
You've always deserved a better life, Heidi.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:48.363
- Why are you doing this for me?
- Well, that's why.

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:51.035
Taylon.

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:02.530
We're running out of time.
You gotta go, now. Get, go.

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:04.817
- I won't forget you.
- Go on. Go.

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:08.621
My county, I'll handle it. Go on.

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:11.723
Go.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:23.938
Hey! You kids! Get outta there!
Go inside now!

01:23:24.032 --> 01:23:26.603
All of you, get off the street!

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:35.954
Get that thing out of here!

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:41.670
Where's your partner?

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:44.196
You told me to tell him to wait
at the train station.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:46.863
Give me your pistol. Give it to me.

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:50.366
Go get him.
The whore's down here in the bank.

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:48.091
- Is that Jake out there with them?
- What?

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:54.628
How would that be Jake?
What the hell would he be doing up here?

01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:06.575
I'm telling you it is, he's got that damn
Winchester pointed straight at us.

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:10.743
Yeah. Does he know it's us?

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:14.596
He will when he sees
that damn crooked smile of yours.

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:16.086
There you go.

01:25:21.316 --> 01:25:22.920
You know, Virgil...

01:25:25.153 --> 01:25:26.723
he's gonna kill you.

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:39.439
Yeah. I know.

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:45.979
Virg? I'm sorry
I didn't go out front with you.

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:51.423
I'm sorry I didn't die with you. I really am.

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:00.362
I know.

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:04.126
But that's why we're here now.

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.739
So, let's get to business.

01:26:10.064 --> 01:26:12.737
I think we could probably
take them all down this time,

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:15.444
even Jake and his damn Winchester.

01:26:16.304 --> 01:26:17.805
We go on three.

01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:19.360
One...

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:23.854
- Wait, wait, Virg.
- Two! You ready?

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:25.946
Let's give them hell.

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:28.959
You don't need to do this, Taylon.

01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:33.161
Is that you, Jake?

01:26:33.555 --> 01:26:37.503
Of course, it's me. Stop this now!

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:41.539
You wanna see if he'll surrender to you?

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:45.573
- Do what?
- You wanna see if he'll surrender to you?

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.301
That's a good idea.

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:59.419
We both know you're not gonna harm the girl.

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:01.603
So, come on out.

01:27:01.683 --> 01:27:04.572
She'll be fine unless you try
to break in here.

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:09.259
- You don't need her. Let her go.
- Not until you hear me out!

01:27:10.124 --> 01:27:12.661
Jaden is trying to kill the whore.

01:27:13.194 --> 01:27:17.642
And all she did was give me back
my horse and my money.

01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:19.471
She tried to kill me!

01:27:29.677 --> 01:27:34.387
Stop firing! Stop firing! You too, Taylon!

01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:41.629
He needs killing, Jake!

01:27:41.856 --> 01:27:46.099
He shot Sam in the back!
You hear what I said?

01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:50.502
Take it to the judge!
I promise you'll get a fair hearing.

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:53.102
Well, that's not gonna happen.

01:27:53.801 --> 01:27:55.837
Jaden will never stop hunting her.

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:02.877
- She's not an outlaw.
- Nope. She ain't.

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:09.352
Ain't a whore no more either,
and that's because of you.

01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:13.129
But you...

01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:15.726
you are an outlaw.

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.504
Son of a...

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:27.176
Stop firing, damn it!

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:36.749
Damn it, Jaden.

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:55.599
- Looks like you took one.
- Yeah.

01:28:56.864 --> 01:28:58.673
I think I took two.

01:29:00.301 --> 01:29:01.472
Well?

01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:12.055
Well... looks like I'm gonna
be seeing you soon.

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:16.861
- I guess so.
- Yep.

01:29:24.158 --> 01:29:27.901
Well... yeah.

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:06.908
Try it again.

01:30:16.477 --> 01:30:18.354
That rifle never worked.

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:31.128
This ends right here, now.

01:30:33.027 --> 01:30:35.336
Try to take me in, old man.

01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:39.608
Nobody gives a crap about us.

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:43.612
All right.

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:48.550
Wesley, I gotta take you in.

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:52.056
You still wanna do this?

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:54.490
I gotta get you to the doctor.

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:57.726
I didn't come to Durango for a doctor.

01:30:59.353 --> 01:31:01.075
I didn't want it to go down like this.

01:31:01.155 --> 01:31:03.157
No, I don't reckon you did.

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:07.148
I can't believe you shot Virgil.

01:31:07.228 --> 01:31:08.816
I didn't even know it was Virgil.

01:31:08.896 --> 01:31:11.171
Would that even have made a difference?

01:31:15.203 --> 01:31:16.545
I don't know.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:20.982
I don't know.

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:25.419
Good Lord, you look old.

01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:27.653
I am old.

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:32.161
Shit.

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:38.601
Where's Heidi?

01:31:40.461 --> 01:31:42.964
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:31:46.701 --> 01:31:52.207
You don't have to worry about Heidi.
She'll be okay, I assure you.

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:56.518
There's ain't no one to go after her anymore.

01:31:59.814 --> 01:32:05.127
Jake? You should've taken care
of my Heidi girl.

01:32:13.261 --> 01:32:16.241
You should've taken care
of my Heidi girl, Jake.

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:21.113
- Sheriff?
- Not now.

01:32:21.903 --> 01:32:23.939
But he said to give these to you now.

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:31.479
- Who?
- Him.

01:32:32.446 --> 01:32:34.789
<i>Everybody pays.</i>

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:49.206
You gonna go get him, Sheriff Will?

01:32:50.064 --> 01:32:51.235
No.

01:32:56.203 --> 01:33:01.345
You just gonna let him get away?
Shouldn't he have to go before the judge?

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:11.523
All aboard!

01:33:16.157 --> 01:33:20.147
Sheriff Will. Shouldn't he have
to go before the judge?

01:33:20.227 --> 01:33:21.728
That's where he's going.
