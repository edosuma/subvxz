00:02.458 --> 00:06.875
(Londo)
'A Narn heavy cruiser?
This is intolerable!'

00:06.958 --> 00:09.375
By treaty, all Narn
warships will be

00:09.458 --> 00:11.458
turned over
to Centauri forces.

00:11.542 --> 00:12.917
Sorry, we didn't
sign that treaty.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.083
You got a problem,
call Earth.

00:14.167 --> 00:15.458
If they hadn't
forced us to break away

00:15.542 --> 00:17.458
we wouldn't need a mutual
protection agreement.

00:17.542 --> 00:19.000
That means we take
every ship we can get.

00:19.083 --> 00:20.917
And what guarantees
will you give me

00:21.000 --> 00:23.083
that the cruiser
will not open fire

00:23.167 --> 00:26.958
on a Centauri vessel as it
approaches Babylon 5, mm?

00:27.042 --> 00:28.875
It's the same guarantee
I gave when I said that

00:28.958 --> 00:30.833
none of the other Narns
would break into your quarters

00:30.917 --> 00:33.417
in the middle of the night
and slit your throat.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.792
Mr. Garibaldi, you have
never given me that promise.

00:36.875 --> 00:38.875
You're right.

00:38.958 --> 00:40.417
Sleep tight.

00:49.458 --> 00:50.958
Can I help you?

00:51.042 --> 00:53.250
Ah, yes, I'm looking
for Dr. Franklin.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.708
I'm afraid he's not here.

00:54.792 --> 00:57.083
He's taken a personal
leave of absence

00:57.167 --> 00:59.250
from his post
as chief of staff.

00:59.333 --> 01:01.583
Is there something
I can do for you?

01:01.667 --> 01:05.708
I just arrived, and I heard
about Ambassador Kosh.

01:05.792 --> 01:08.292
I was hoping someone here
could tell me what happened.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.625
I'm afraid that information
is confidential.

01:10.708 --> 01:13.792
Look, I know he is dead. I'm not
gonna say anything to anyone.

01:13.875 --> 01:16.833
I was just..
I am his..

01:16.917 --> 01:19.083
- I was his aide.
- Mm.

01:20.875 --> 01:24.750
I was wondering if anyone was
there when it happened. If..

01:24.833 --> 01:29.833
- Did anyone speak to him?
- No, I'm sorry.

01:29.917 --> 01:33.208
By the time we were called in,
it was too late.

01:35.583 --> 01:38.125
Alright. Thank you.

01:47.583 --> 01:49.667
Chief, you're just in time.

01:49.750 --> 01:51.583
The Vorlon transport
carrying their new ambassador

01:51.667 --> 01:54.375
just came through
the jumpgate. What's up?

01:54.458 --> 01:55.542
Captain wants to
convene a meeting

01:55.625 --> 01:56.708
of the War Council
this afternoon.

01:56.792 --> 01:58.083
Figured I'd give you
a heads up on it.

01:58.167 --> 01:59.542
Thanks, the way
the day has been going

01:59.625 --> 02:01.667
I'll take whatever
advance warning I can get.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.083
Better get the captain
on the link.

02:03.167 --> 02:04.667
Tell him the Vorlon
ship's about to dock.

02:04.750 --> 02:08.417
- Ah, I can do that.
- Why?

02:08.500 --> 02:12.042
I'd just prefer to.
That's all.

02:12.125 --> 02:14.542
Okay. What is it?

02:14.625 --> 02:16.417
Look, with everything that's
been going on around here lately

02:16.500 --> 02:19.042
he just needed to get out a
little, stretch his legs a bit.

02:19.125 --> 02:21.542
So he took a walk..

02:23.792 --> 02:28.042
...outside, on the forward
cargo stabilizers.

02:28.917 --> 02:30.125
[sighs]

02:37.792 --> 02:40.333
[instrumental music]

03:07.833 --> 03:10.375
[music continues]

03:40.708 --> 03:45.667
(Ivanova)
The Babylon Project was
our last, best hope for peace.

03:49.208 --> 03:51.000
It failed.

03:51.083 --> 03:53.667
[instrumental music]

04:05.542 --> 04:07.292
(Ivanova)
But in the year
of the Shadow War

04:07.375 --> 04:09.625
it became something greater

04:09.708 --> 04:13.333
our last, best hope
for victory.

04:17.667 --> 04:23.000
The year is 2260.
The place, "Babylon 5."

04:23.083 --> 04:25.625
[theme music]

04:53.125 --> 04:55.667
[music continues]

05:08.667 --> 05:11.208
[instrumental music]

05:11.292 --> 05:13.667
(Na'Kal)
'I thank you for this, G'Kar.'

05:13.750 --> 05:15.042
We've been on
the run for so long

05:15.125 --> 05:16.792
I haven't tasted
fresh food for months.

05:16.875 --> 05:19.625
Well, it's not the hero's
welcome you deserve

05:19.708 --> 05:21.458
but it will do for now.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.958
Breen.

05:25.042 --> 05:27.583
You've managed to import
breen from Homeworld. How?

05:27.667 --> 05:30.375
It isn't actually breen.

05:30.458 --> 05:33.250
- The smell, the taste--
- It's an Earth food.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.250
They are called
Swedish meatballs.

05:36.333 --> 05:39.042
It's a strange thing,
but every sentient race

05:39.125 --> 05:42.417
has its own version
of these Swedish meatballs.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.417
I suspect it's one of those
great universal mysteries

05:45.500 --> 05:48.167
which will either
never be explained

05:48.250 --> 05:52.417
or which would drive you mad
if you ever learned the truth.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.417
So, Na'Kal, have you
been able to determine

05:55.500 --> 05:58.083
how many of our ships
survived the war?

05:59.833 --> 06:03.667
The Centauri and their allies
were quite thorough, G'Kar.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.125
We estimate no more than ten.

06:05.208 --> 06:09.875
A mix of dreadnoughts,
heavy cruisers, medium warships.

06:11.417 --> 06:14.333
Fortunately, the Centauri
were in such a hurry

06:14.417 --> 06:17.792
to reach Homeworld, they left
some of our ships disabled

06:17.875 --> 06:19.958
but not destroyed.

06:20.042 --> 06:21.292
Most are being repaired now

06:21.375 --> 06:23.792
cannibalizing one
to fix another.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.917
What of your ship, Na'Kal?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.292
The "G'Tok" is fully functional.

06:28.375 --> 06:31.250
Had we not been given shelter by
Captain Sheridan during the last

06:31.333 --> 06:34.708
days of the war, the story might
have been very different.

06:37.042 --> 06:38.667
When do we strike back?

06:40.417 --> 06:41.542
We don't.

06:44.208 --> 06:47.708
Not until we have repaired
the other ships.

06:47.792 --> 06:50.125
For now, the most important
thing we can do

06:50.208 --> 06:53.458
is lend our forces
to protect this place.

06:53.542 --> 06:58.750
Because if Babylon 5 falls,
we all fall with it.

06:58.833 --> 07:01.208
I thought Garibaldi
was going to be here.

07:01.292 --> 07:02.458
He was,
and then I told him

07:02.542 --> 07:04.292
what I noticed in
the maintenance log.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.250
Dr. Franklin hasn't been in
or out of his quarters

07:06.333 --> 07:08.833
in three, almost four days.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.167
Has anyone
seen him lately?

07:10.250 --> 07:13.167
No, that's what's
got Garibaldi worried.

07:13.250 --> 07:16.667
Ever since he resigned Medlab,
he just hasn't been the same.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.625
I think he's in a lot of pain.

07:18.708 --> 07:21.500
Damn, I should have gone
to see him.

07:21.583 --> 07:23.750
Well, when he told me
he was hooked on stims

07:23.833 --> 07:25.875
I-I didn't know
what to say.

07:25.958 --> 07:27.833
I was floored.

07:27.917 --> 07:30.667
Then everything got nuts,
as it always does.

07:31.917 --> 07:35.292
Ah, that's no excuse.
I hope he's okay.

07:35.375 --> 07:36.542
Garibaldi said he'd link in

07:36.625 --> 07:38.583
as soon as
he found out anything.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.333
[door opens]

08:00.958 --> 08:03.083
Welcome to Babylon 5,
ambassador.

08:03.167 --> 08:04.583
I'm Captain John Sheridan.

08:04.667 --> 08:07.333
This is my second,
Commander Susan Ivanova.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.417
Thank you for coming.

08:09.500 --> 08:13.625
Ah, I wish we could have
met under better circumstances.

08:13.708 --> 08:17.542
I didn't know Ambassador Kosh
as well as I might have wished.

08:17.625 --> 08:20.125
I'm not sure anyone did, really.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.208
But we were enriched
by his presence

08:22.292 --> 08:25.167
and we are all
diminished by his loss.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.583
As per your
government's request

08:30.667 --> 08:32.792
we've kept Kosh's death a secret

08:32.875 --> 08:34.292
known only to the command staff

08:34.375 --> 08:37.000
and those Medlab personnel
directly involved.

08:37.083 --> 08:40.167
To avoid damaging the fragile
alliance that we've created here

08:40.250 --> 08:42.583
they have asked us to continue
maintaining that secret.

08:42.667 --> 08:46.750
So now I understand,
for all intents and purposes

08:46.833 --> 08:49.625
you are to take
Kosh's place.

08:49.708 --> 08:53.083
You'll occupy his quarters,
and we are to refer to you

08:53.167 --> 08:55.875
by his name when we're in
public, is that correct?

08:58.750 --> 08:59.917
Ah.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.750
Well, then,
we'll show you the way, uh..

09:01.833 --> 09:04.875
Ivanova will brief you
on anything you need to know.

09:05.792 --> 09:08.250
Uh, before you go, um..

09:10.167 --> 09:13.625
Your government neglected
to tell me your name.

09:13.708 --> 09:16.625
How should I refer to you
when we're alone?

09:16.708 --> 09:17.958
Kosh.

09:18.042 --> 09:20.125
Ah, yes, I understand
that's how we're to

09:20.208 --> 09:24.250
refer to you publicly,
but privately?

09:24.333 --> 09:25.625
Kosh.

09:25.708 --> 09:29.250
Ambassador Kosh is...dead.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.958
We are all Kosh.

09:39.167 --> 09:41.625
Well, he's a Vorlon,
alright.

09:41.708 --> 09:43.250
Yep.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.667
- Stephen.
- Michael.

09:57.750 --> 10:00.875
And I was wondering when you'd
get around to looking for me.

10:00.958 --> 10:02.542
How'd you find me?

10:02.625 --> 10:05.000
You've been using your credit
chit to buy food, supplies

10:05.083 --> 10:07.333
and traveling
in a straight line.

10:07.417 --> 10:09.375
So, I figured I'd jump
ahead of that line

10:09.458 --> 10:12.000
and hit the first
open market.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.833
What the hell
are you doing?

10:13.917 --> 10:16.125
Well, it's a long story.
You want some?

10:16.208 --> 10:18.708
No. Why is everything
around here a long story?

10:18.792 --> 10:22.167
Why isn't anything
ever a short story, a paragraph?

10:22.250 --> 10:24.917
Look, just give me
the short version, okay?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.125
Alright. Walkabout.

10:28.208 --> 10:29.125
That's it?

10:29.208 --> 10:30.417
Hey, it's that
or the long version.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.667
So, you know,
you take your pick.

10:32.750 --> 10:36.375
Oh, okay. Okay.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.333
You know, as a Foundationist,
I was always taught

10:42.417 --> 10:45.875
that if you're not careful, you
can lose yourself in the world.

10:45.958 --> 10:47.083
Well, you're too busy
with things

10:47.167 --> 10:49.875
not busy enough
with yourself.

10:49.958 --> 10:52.625
Spend your days and nights
living someone else's agendas

10:52.708 --> 10:55.083
fighting someone else's battles
and you're doing the work

10:55.167 --> 10:56.583
you're supposed to be doing,
but every day

10:56.667 --> 10:59.375
there's less and less
of you in it all.

10:59.458 --> 11:02.708
Till one day you come
to a fork in the road

11:02.792 --> 11:06.667
and because you're distracted,
you're not thinking.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.500
You lose yourself.

11:08.583 --> 11:10.792
You go right,
and the rest of you

11:10.875 --> 11:14.375
the really important
part of you, goes left.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.750
And you don't even know
you've done it till you realize

11:16.833 --> 11:19.542
you finally realize that you
don't have any idea who you are

11:19.625 --> 11:22.667
when you're not doing
all those things.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.917
Stephen,
you don't really believe

11:25.000 --> 11:27.417
there are two of you, do you?

11:27.500 --> 11:29.917
No. It's a metaphor.
Alright?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.667
There isn't literally another me
walking around the station

11:32.750 --> 11:34.500
but the principle is real.

11:36.417 --> 11:39.708
I realized I didn't
have any idea who I was

11:39.792 --> 11:41.708
when I wasn't being
a doctor and I think

11:41.792 --> 11:44.917
I was using the stims
to avoid facing that.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.417
'Now I gotta fix it.'

11:46.500 --> 11:50.083
- How?
- By going walkabout.

11:50.167 --> 11:54.250
You just leave everything,
and you start walking.

11:54.333 --> 11:56.000
I mean, the Foundation
adopted the idea

11:56.083 --> 11:59.458
from the
aborigines back on Earth.

11:59.542 --> 12:02.792
The theory is, if you're
separated from yourself

12:02.875 --> 12:07.125
you start walking and you keep
walking till you meet yourself.

12:07.208 --> 12:11.000
Then you sit down,
and you have a long talk.

12:11.083 --> 12:13.333
Talk about everything
that you've learned

12:13.417 --> 12:15.250
everything that you've felt

12:15.333 --> 12:18.583
and you talk until you've run
out of words, now, that's vital.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.917
Because the real important
things can't be said.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.833
And then, if you're lucky

12:23.917 --> 12:27.083
you look up
and there's just you.

12:27.167 --> 12:29.042
Then you can go home.

12:29.125 --> 12:30.458
You know how crazy this sounds?

12:30.542 --> 12:31.542
Well..

12:31.625 --> 12:34.208
You're a doctor, a scientist.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.917
- And?
- And what?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.375
Exactly.

13:07.917 --> 13:12.125
I had heard you arrived.
I was just coming to see you.

13:15.292 --> 13:17.208
[choking]

13:19.792 --> 13:22.500
- Where?
- I'm sorry.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.250
I wasn't here.

13:26.375 --> 13:29.167
I was doing
what he told me to do.

13:30.792 --> 13:33.250
He wasn't with me
when I left.

13:34.042 --> 13:36.917
Not even a piece of him.

13:37.958 --> 13:39.667
I swear!

13:44.833 --> 13:46.417
Failed.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.333
Gone.

13:50.417 --> 13:53.375
I know. I'm sorry.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.958
It's my fault.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.833
There was no other?

14:01.708 --> 14:02.833
No.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.208
Not that I knew of.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.542
I'm sorry.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.458
He's gone.

14:13.667 --> 14:15.125
Follow.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.542
[instrumental music]

14:26.000 --> 14:29.250
How are you settling in
with the new ambassador?

14:29.333 --> 14:31.833
Fine. Fine.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.625
I sense a little hesitation.

14:37.083 --> 14:42.708
Despite their strengths, the
Vorlons are a delicate people.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.708
They do not react
well to change

14:44.792 --> 14:48.042
and they're not
very forgiving of mistakes.

14:48.125 --> 14:50.000
It's been a long time
since one of them has died.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.917
They're taking it
pretty hard.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.958
It's understandable.

14:54.042 --> 14:55.708
Ah..

14:55.792 --> 14:58.833
I had a hunch
this was the case.

14:58.917 --> 15:02.542
Who knows how long
one of them lives normally?

15:02.625 --> 15:06.292
'I mean, if anything about
them can be called normal.'

15:06.375 --> 15:08.958
'Well, if you do have any
problems with the ambassador'

15:09.042 --> 15:11.625
'I hope you'll let me know.'

15:11.708 --> 15:16.083
- 'Is there a problem?'
- What?

15:16.167 --> 15:20.750
- I said, is there a problem?
- No, no.

15:20.833 --> 15:23.375
Everything's fine.
Is there anything else?

15:23.458 --> 15:24.708
Yes.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.292
There is something
I need you to do.

15:31.375 --> 15:35.500

17:51.708 --> 17:54.250
Thank you for coming.
Please be seated.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.375
As you know..

17:58.458 --> 18:00.542
...Mr. Garibaldi recently
uncovered information

18:00.625 --> 18:04.708
which seems to indicate
the Shadows have a weakness.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.167
Now, their ships are based
on organic technology

18:07.250 --> 18:10.000
which may be vulnerable
to telepathic interference.

18:10.083 --> 18:12.792
In theory,
a telepath might be able to

18:12.875 --> 18:15.042
jam their
central operating system

18:15.125 --> 18:17.042
leaving them vulnerable
to attack.

18:17.125 --> 18:20.250
I noticed a number
of conditional phrases in that

18:20.333 --> 18:24.875
"Seems to indicate a weakness,"
"may be vulnerable" "in theory."

18:24.958 --> 18:29.083
Exactly. Maybe we're right,
maybe we ain't.

18:29.167 --> 18:32.458
Unfortunately, war doesn't
tolerate ambiguities.

18:32.542 --> 18:35.667
We have to find out
if we're right.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.917
So I have decided
to test the proposition.

18:40.333 --> 18:44.000
In a few hours, I'll be leaving
on the "White Star".

18:44.083 --> 18:45.917
I've asked our only
resident telepath

18:46.000 --> 18:49.375
Lyta Alexander, to come along,
she has agreed.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.042
We'll take up position
in hyperspace.

18:51.125 --> 18:53.250
As soon as we hear
of a Shadow attack

18:53.333 --> 18:56.333
we'll jump out and engage
one of their fleet ships.

18:56.417 --> 19:00.083
We'll attempt to
jam it...and then destroy it.

19:00.167 --> 19:02.333
Captain, the last two times
that we ran into full blown

19:02.417 --> 19:04.333
Shadow vessels
the only way we got out alive

19:04.417 --> 19:05.833
was by outsmarting them.

19:05.917 --> 19:07.833
We used Jupiter's gravity
to destroy one

19:07.917 --> 19:09.875
and blew up
a jumpgate to kill another.

19:09.958 --> 19:11.708
We've never tried
a head-on confrontation.

19:11.792 --> 19:14.542
Which makes this mission
absolutely essential.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.083
Now, to minimize our losses,
I'll take a skeleton crew.

19:19.167 --> 19:23.792
Mr. Lennier, since I'll need
a translator, you'd be an asset

19:23.875 --> 19:25.708
'but the choice is yours.'

19:25.792 --> 19:28.250
Of course.
I would be honored.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.417
There is a second part
to this experiment.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.208
Even if we succeed
in jamming one of those ships

19:34.292 --> 19:38.250
the "White Star" may not have
the firepower to destroy it.

19:38.333 --> 19:42.250
If any of you could send along
one of your ships as escort..

19:42.333 --> 19:45.333
Only the "G'Tok" is capable
of a mission of this nature.

19:45.417 --> 19:48.458
I will have to discuss
this with her captain.

19:48.542 --> 19:50.583
Fair enough.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.250
- Delenn?
- Consider it done.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.542
Good.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.375
Anyone else?

20:06.667 --> 20:09.417
Captain, I do have one concern.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.792
We do not know how strong
a telepath has to be

20:11.875 --> 20:14.708
to jam a Shadow vessel,
or how many are necessary.

20:14.792 --> 20:17.167
Lyta is a P-5.
She may not be strong enough.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.542
I agree, if you're determined
to go through with this

20:19.625 --> 20:21.125
I recommend some backup.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.833
Bring along a couple of Minbari
telepaths on the other ship.

20:23.917 --> 20:25.667
If it looks that things
aren't working

20:25.750 --> 20:26.917
bring them into range

20:27.000 --> 20:28.167
and see if it
makes a difference.

20:28.250 --> 20:30.250
I'm trying
to minimize the risks.

20:30.333 --> 20:31.667
You're not minimizing
anybody's risk

20:31.750 --> 20:33.833
if you don't bring back
solid information.

20:33.917 --> 20:37.042
This way, we'll know what we
need to shut these things down.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.708
- I agree.
- Good.

20:38.792 --> 20:40.542
- All agreed say aye.
- Aye.

20:40.625 --> 20:42.083
- Opposed?
- Nay.

20:42.167 --> 20:44.375
The ayes have it.
The War Council has spoken.

20:44.458 --> 20:46.292
You'll do it our way.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.708
You look like
you're waiting for somebody.

20:55.417 --> 20:57.292
I was.

20:57.375 --> 20:58.833
Well, what happened?

20:58.917 --> 21:00.917
She just got here.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.875
It doesn't look like
you're from this part of town.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.917
What's your story?
Thanks.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.750
You a, you a businessman?

21:12.833 --> 21:14.667
Are you flying in,
checking out

21:14.750 --> 21:16.625
the low-rent spots
for a little action?

21:16.708 --> 21:18.542
- I live here.
- Oh, yeah?

21:18.625 --> 21:21.000
- I'm a doctor.
- 'Yeah?'

21:21.083 --> 21:24.750
Yeah, my mama always told me
to marry a doctor.

21:24.833 --> 21:28.125
I just could never find one
with the right equipment.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.875
[laughs]

21:31.417 --> 21:36.542
You know, I saw you
watching me up there..

21:36.625 --> 21:40.542
...and it was like two lasers

21:40.625 --> 21:42.542
shining out in the night.

21:42.625 --> 21:44.250
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

21:44.333 --> 21:46.542
I mean, once I got
used to the glare

21:46.625 --> 21:49.208
you know,
I kind of liked it.

21:49.292 --> 21:51.667
You know, you're-you're good.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.417
I mean, you are really good.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.250
You're-you're-you're too good
for a place like this.

21:56.333 --> 21:57.500
That's for sure.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.042
So..

22:01.708 --> 22:03.917
- So, what's your name?
- Stephen.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.125
Ugh, I had a old
boyfriend named Stephen

22:06.208 --> 22:09.667
and he tore my heart down
one side and up the other.

22:09.750 --> 22:12.333
- So you're gonna be Steve.
- Steve. Alright.

22:12.417 --> 22:14.583
- And I'm Cailyn.
- 'Cailyn.'

22:14.667 --> 22:17.750
And I am proud and honored

22:17.833 --> 22:19.917
to make your acquaintance.

22:34.625 --> 22:39.083
Oh, Na'Kal, good. Thank you
for coming. I know it's late.

22:39.167 --> 22:41.125
- Did you get my message?
- I did.

22:41.208 --> 22:42.458
Your opinion?

22:42.542 --> 22:45.417
Sheridan is embarking
upon a fool's mission.

22:45.500 --> 22:46.875
We recovered records
from our fleet's

22:46.958 --> 22:48.750
last battle with these
Shadow vessels.

22:48.833 --> 22:52.333
- They never had a chance.
- He thinks he has one now.

22:52.417 --> 22:54.042
Perhaps.

22:54.125 --> 22:56.750
But our few remaining ships
are our only hope

22:56.833 --> 22:59.083
of ever reclaiming Homeworld.

22:59.167 --> 23:02.375
We cannot waste them
on fool's missions.

23:02.458 --> 23:05.958
But if we withdraw our support
the odds of his returning

23:06.042 --> 23:08.500
to Babylon 5
are considerably smaller.

23:08.583 --> 23:12.542
We cannot squander
our resources, G'Kar.

23:12.625 --> 23:17.292
If he dies...then he dies.

23:21.083 --> 23:23.042
(Captain John Sheridan)
Ship's log.

23:23.125 --> 23:27.750
We're en route
to Sector 90 by 110 by 47.

23:27.833 --> 23:29.792
There have been three
Shadow attacks in this area

23:29.875 --> 23:31.917
in the last week,
so the odds are good

23:32.000 --> 23:34.500
they'll hit again soon.

23:34.583 --> 23:38.583
The second we hear anything,
we will jump to normal space.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.000
I'd feel better about this
if we had a few more ships

23:41.083 --> 23:43.417
but we can't wait any longer.

23:44.542 --> 23:46.958
I just hope this works.

23:58.333 --> 24:01.125
- Why do you keep doing that?
- 'Shh, shh.'

24:01.208 --> 24:03.125
I'm looking at your soul.

24:03.208 --> 24:07.667
I have a theory that
light passes through us

24:07.750 --> 24:11.917
'refracting our soul, mind,
and body like a rainbow.'

24:12.000 --> 24:17.125
'And if I get the glass
at the right angle'

24:17.208 --> 24:20.750
I can see through
to someone's soul.

24:20.833 --> 24:24.167
- What do you see?
- 'Just pieces.'

24:26.917 --> 24:28.500
Hasn't worked yet.

24:28.583 --> 24:31.750
Well, maybe it worked better
than you think it did.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.875
What are you doing here?

24:33.958 --> 24:36.958
I don't quite know myself.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.833
That's the wrong answer.

24:40.917 --> 24:43.625
You're supposed to say
that you're here

24:43.708 --> 24:47.708
to spend the night
with a beautiful woman.

24:47.792 --> 24:49.250
I am?

24:52.417 --> 24:54.250
(Cailyn)
'You could be.'

24:55.833 --> 24:57.458
[doorbell]

25:02.333 --> 25:03.500
[doorbell]

25:03.583 --> 25:05.917
Ah-ha!

25:06.750 --> 25:10.583
Yes, yes! What? Come in!

25:10.667 --> 25:13.542
- I brought back your damn book.
- Surely this can wait until--

25:13.625 --> 25:15.958
After all why the hell should I
care what is in it if you don't?

25:16.042 --> 25:17.792
- You're not making sense.
- No?

25:17.875 --> 25:19.958
What the hell is that
Narn ship still doing here?

25:20.042 --> 25:22.958
Ah, I discussed the situation
with Warleader Na'Kal.

25:23.042 --> 25:25.125
He felt it was better
to conserve our resources.

25:25.208 --> 25:27.250
Did he?
Well, how practical of him.

25:27.333 --> 25:28.958
- Oh, now--
- No, no, no! Never mind.

25:29.042 --> 25:31.458
You're right.
He's right. Everybody's right.

25:31.542 --> 25:33.208
Let's just look out
for ourselves.

25:33.292 --> 25:34.667
When that cruiser
popped out of hyperspace

25:34.750 --> 25:36.333
we should've done
the same thing.

25:36.417 --> 25:38.250
We should have just let
the Centauri take custody of it

25:38.333 --> 25:40.500
in the first place,
instead of sending out our ships

25:40.583 --> 25:42.500
and our pilots to defend it.

25:42.583 --> 25:46.167
- Well, he doesn't want to go.
- Of course he doesn't.

25:46.250 --> 25:48.375
It's easy to fight when you got
a lot of ships to work with.

25:48.458 --> 25:51.292
The real crunch comes when
you're down to almost nothing.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.625
Then you either play it safe
and you probably lose it all

25:53.708 --> 25:55.833
or you take a chance.

25:55.917 --> 25:57.625
After everything what we've
been through with your people

25:57.708 --> 25:59.208
Sheridan was crazy
to send our pilots out

25:59.292 --> 26:01.542
to fight for your ship.
They didn't wanna go.

26:01.625 --> 26:03.000
They didn't want to get
blown out of the sky

26:03.083 --> 26:04.208
and leave B5 defenseless

26:04.292 --> 26:05.667
and they sure as hell
didn't wanna die!

26:05.750 --> 26:08.250
But they did it because
Sheridan told them to do it

26:08.333 --> 26:10.292
and because it was right.

26:10.375 --> 26:12.417
This time it is possible
he could be wrong.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.667
Yeah, it's possible.

26:13.750 --> 26:15.125
But you don't follow
an order because you know

26:15.208 --> 26:16.333
for sure it's gonna work out.

26:16.417 --> 26:17.500
You do what you're told

26:17.583 --> 26:18.833
because your CO
has the moral authority

26:18.917 --> 26:20.958
that says
you may not come back.

26:21.042 --> 26:24.458
But the cause is just and fair
and necessary.

26:24.542 --> 26:25.958
That's why Sheridan is out there

26:26.042 --> 26:28.958
and damn it, that's where
that cruiser should be too!

26:29.042 --> 26:31.167
It's not Na'Kal's
decision, G'Kar.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.125
He doesn't see
the big picture. You do.

26:34.208 --> 26:36.917
So in my book..

26:37.000 --> 26:40.500
...and your book, that makes it
your responsibility.

26:40.583 --> 26:42.250
Deal with it.

26:54.167 --> 26:57.750
It's not right,
you living here like this.

26:57.833 --> 27:01.292
- You could do so much better.
- No.

27:03.083 --> 27:06.458
I am where I am,
and it is what it is.

27:08.708 --> 27:10.208
But I could help.

27:14.167 --> 27:15.792
Look, I'm okay.

27:16.958 --> 27:19.000
I'm not a wounded bird.

27:20.375 --> 27:22.250
I know.

27:22.333 --> 27:23.583
I know.

27:23.667 --> 27:26.292
I just wish there
was something I could do.

27:28.167 --> 27:32.333
Well...there is.

27:34.167 --> 27:35.458
What?

27:38.292 --> 27:41.083
- Metazine.
- Metazine?

27:43.667 --> 27:45.625
That stuff's prescription only.
It's a narcotic.

27:45.708 --> 27:48.292
I, I know.
It-it helps me sleep.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.792
Well..

27:50.875 --> 27:53.250
You could sleep a lot better

27:53.333 --> 27:55.625
if you didn't drink
as much as you do.

28:04.667 --> 28:08.500
Look, you asked if there
was anything you could do.

28:11.833 --> 28:15.750
No. Look, ask me anything else
but that. Okay?

28:17.292 --> 28:18.542
Okay.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.458
[instrumental music]

28:32.667 --> 28:34.958
[sighs]

28:35.042 --> 28:36.792
Worried?

28:36.875 --> 28:37.917
A little.

28:39.042 --> 28:41.083
I've never done
anything like this before.

28:42.208 --> 28:44.667
Well, if it helps,
neither have I.

28:45.625 --> 28:47.083
In the grand scheme of things

28:47.167 --> 28:49.208
this is one hell
of a lab experiment.

28:51.167 --> 28:53.292
While we're waiting,
can I ask you a question?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.708
Hmm, shoot.

28:56.792 --> 28:58.792
How did you find out
Kosh had died?

29:00.167 --> 29:01.125
It was strange.

29:01.208 --> 29:03.833
I woke up out of a dream

29:03.917 --> 29:07.167
and I just knew somehow.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.750
At least once before,
Kosh had touched my mind

29:11.833 --> 29:15.333
and...I guess it left me
sensitive enough

29:15.417 --> 29:17.750
to feel it
when he was killed.

29:17.833 --> 29:19.500
'Why?'

29:19.583 --> 29:21.667
No reason.

29:21.750 --> 29:24.167
I guess..

29:24.250 --> 29:26.958
I'm just feeling guilty

29:27.042 --> 29:28.708
because I wasn't there
when it all happened.

29:28.792 --> 29:32.625
You couldn't have done anything.
No one could.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.667
Captain, we're picking up
a distress signal

29:38.750 --> 29:40.792
from a relay post
in the target area.

29:40.875 --> 29:42.125
Is it them?

29:43.375 --> 29:44.958
- Yes.
- Alright.

29:45.042 --> 29:47.667
Stand by to jump to
normal space on my mark.

29:47.750 --> 29:49.458
Tell the Minbari ship
to stand by

29:49.542 --> 29:52.417
in hyperspace until we signal.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.208
You ready?

29:54.292 --> 29:55.917
As ready as I'll ever be.

29:57.792 --> 29:59.083
Take us in, Mr. Lennier.

29:59.167 --> 30:01.750
[instrumental music]

30:15.458 --> 30:19.375
I need to be on a line of sight
for this to work.

30:19.458 --> 30:20.750
Bring us around.

30:36.333 --> 30:37.958
Lyta?

30:40.250 --> 30:43.375
No! No! No! No! No!

30:45.375 --> 30:47.583
Captain, the ship
is changing course

30:47.667 --> 30:49.708
coming in on attack vector.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.292
I think it knows we're here.

30:59.667 --> 31:01.583
[instrumental music]

31:02.917 --> 31:05.417
The Shadow vessel is approaching
optimum firing range.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.875
Lyta, listen to me.
I need you to focus.

31:07.958 --> 31:09.333
I can't.

31:09.417 --> 31:12.333
Should we jump to hyperspace
or call in our other ship?

31:13.958 --> 31:16.792
(John)
'Lyta. Lyta!'

31:21.333 --> 31:22.708
Kosh!

31:31.125 --> 31:32.958
They killed him.

31:35.208 --> 31:37.500
They tore him apart.

31:41.375 --> 31:43.750
Burn, you bastard.

31:49.667 --> 31:53.792
- Mr. Lennier?
- It's not moving.

32:00.917 --> 32:05.208
If you're gonna do something,
do it now.

32:07.708 --> 32:10.292
All power to the forward
batteries, Mr. Lennier.

32:11.292 --> 32:13.792
One focused continuous burst.

32:16.083 --> 32:17.375
Now.

32:23.250 --> 32:25.833
More power to the weapons
system, Mr. Lennier.

32:25.917 --> 32:28.625
Let's see what it takes
to kill one of these things.

32:28.708 --> 32:30.958
I'll have to take
the jump engines off-line

32:31.042 --> 32:32.792
but if I do, we won't be
able to make a jump

32:32.875 --> 32:34.667
for 20 standard minutes.

32:36.042 --> 32:37.333
Proceed.

32:44.125 --> 32:46.333
Keep it going, Mr. Lennier.

32:52.708 --> 32:54.667
[sighs]

32:54.750 --> 32:57.667
I'm alright. I'm alright.
I just need a moment.

32:57.750 --> 32:59.042
Yeah.

33:05.958 --> 33:08.542
[instrumental music]

33:29.500 --> 33:31.708
Can you tell me what you felt?

33:31.792 --> 33:37.125
I could feel it shifting around
in my mind, trying to slip away.

33:37.208 --> 33:40.708
- I almost lost it twice.
- It's alright now.

33:40.792 --> 33:42.417
We found out what
we came to find out.

33:42.500 --> 33:43.958
No, it's not alright.

33:44.042 --> 33:46.333
I tried to stop it,
but I think it got off

33:46.417 --> 33:48.375
a distress call
before we killed it.

33:50.250 --> 33:52.083
How much longer
before we can jump?

33:52.167 --> 33:53.542
Another ten standard minutes.

33:53.625 --> 33:56.333
I'm still building
the power back up.

33:56.417 --> 33:58.458
I'm picking up
a local disturbance.

33:58.542 --> 34:01.000
It reads like
a jump point opening.

34:01.083 --> 34:04.875
- Is it the Minbari ship?
- I don't think so.

34:10.667 --> 34:14.833
We've got four,
repeat, four Shadow vessels.

34:14.917 --> 34:17.833
They don't want us to get out of
here alive with what we know.

34:17.917 --> 34:21.083
- Are you sure we can't jump?
- Positive.

34:21.167 --> 34:24.042
- Then we have a problem.
- Yes, sir.

34:25.208 --> 34:26.750
Run for it.

34:42.125 --> 34:45.708
- Captain Sheridan.
- Yes, captain.

34:45.792 --> 34:49.000
We've monitored your situation.
Moving to intercept.

34:49.083 --> 34:51.083
How many telepaths
do you have onboard?

34:51.167 --> 34:52.208
Three.

34:53.583 --> 34:57.167
- There are four of those ships.
- We'll do what we can.

35:00.417 --> 35:03.292
[dramatic music]

35:18.333 --> 35:21.125
One's getting through.
Evasive action!

35:30.792 --> 35:33.333
[music continues]

35:37.958 --> 35:39.417
Can we fire?

35:39.500 --> 35:43.417
Weapons system at 60 percent of
normal. Not enough to hurt it.

35:43.500 --> 35:46.875
If there is anything you can do,
now would be a good time.

35:46.958 --> 35:51.375
That last one
took everything I had.

35:51.458 --> 35:53.083
I can't get through.

35:53.167 --> 35:57.750
Shadow vessel locking on. Their
weapons are at full strength.

35:57.833 --> 35:59.750
We're not gonna make it.

36:00.875 --> 36:03.417
[dramatic music]

36:10.917 --> 36:12.375
Bring us around fast.

36:12.458 --> 36:14.208
If we can add
our firepower to theirs

36:14.292 --> 36:15.708
Coming about.

36:24.667 --> 36:27.792
(G'Kar)
'This is G'Kar to White Star.
Are you alright?'

36:27.875 --> 36:31.083
Yes, for now.
Thanks for coming.

36:31.167 --> 36:34.208
(G'Kar)
'Oh, I'm not on
the G'Tok, captain.'

36:34.292 --> 36:37.125
And I brought some friends.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.417
They ran.

36:53.792 --> 36:55.667
Yes, they did, Mr. Lennier.

36:57.125 --> 36:58.833
They did indeed.

37:08.458 --> 37:11.625
(Kosh)
And so it begins.

37:21.375 --> 37:23.250
Cailyn?

37:31.208 --> 37:32.875
Hey, Cailyn?

37:36.792 --> 37:40.000
Come on, Cailyn. Wake up.
Wake up, Cailyn!

37:40.083 --> 37:44.208
Cailyn, come on now. Wake up.
Cailyn, you hear me?

37:44.292 --> 37:45.917
Oh, no.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.750
Come on, Cailyn!

37:56.792 --> 37:59.250
(Dr. Hobbs)
'Good to see you back, doctor.'

37:59.333 --> 38:00.750
Well, I'm not.

38:00.833 --> 38:05.125
I'm just making sure that she's
okay. What's the prognosis?

38:05.208 --> 38:08.458
She'll be okay. We've got her
on a Metazine drip now--

38:08.542 --> 38:10.042
Metazine?
Are you out of your mind?

38:10.125 --> 38:11.500
That's what put her
here in the first place--

38:11.583 --> 38:13.750
Doctor, it wasn't an overdose.

38:15.292 --> 38:17.000
What are you talking about?
I saw the vial in her hand.

38:17.083 --> 38:18.667
I found her unconscious
on the floor.

38:18.750 --> 38:20.500
The vial
hadn't been opened yet.

38:20.583 --> 38:23.042
My guess is she used your
Identi-card to get the Metazine

38:23.125 --> 38:25.833
from a local dispensary because
she couldn't afford it anymore.

38:25.917 --> 38:27.250
'Then she came back
to her quarters'

38:27.333 --> 38:29.500
'and passed out
before she could use it.'

38:29.583 --> 38:31.750
Passed out from what?

38:31.833 --> 38:33.333
The pain.

38:34.458 --> 38:36.083
'I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.'

38:36.167 --> 38:38.375
Knew what?

38:38.458 --> 38:40.667
She was diagnosed
with terminal neural paralysis

38:40.750 --> 38:45.500
a little over two years ago just
before you got here, incurable.

38:45.583 --> 38:47.458
'She took it pretty hard.'

38:47.542 --> 38:50.500
'She had a pretty good career
going back home as a singer.'

38:52.208 --> 38:54.417
Dr. Kyle handled the diagnosis.

38:57.875 --> 39:01.875
Why, uh, why wasn't I told?

39:01.958 --> 39:03.750
We assumed she'd
gone back to Earth.

39:03.833 --> 39:06.583
We don't generally track
patients after they leave here.

39:06.667 --> 39:09.667
I mean, what she's still doing
here is anybody's guess.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.667
How much time
does she have left?

39:16.333 --> 39:19.917
Given her current condition..

39:20.000 --> 39:22.750
...six months, maybe seven.

39:28.792 --> 39:30.542
- Hey.
- 'Hey.'

39:32.292 --> 39:33.750
How you doing?

39:33.833 --> 39:36.500
I see they're giving me
the VIP treatment.

39:38.208 --> 39:41.167
You didn't tell me you were
such a big shot around here.

39:41.250 --> 39:42.542
Well..

39:44.542 --> 39:47.833
- How do I look?
- Like hell.

39:47.917 --> 39:49.708
[laughs]

39:52.292 --> 39:53.417
Hey..

39:54.708 --> 39:57.583
Why didn't
you tell me, Cailyn?

39:57.667 --> 40:02.292
Singing is the only thing
that's ever meant a damn to me.

40:02.375 --> 40:05.292
It let's me know I'm alive.

40:05.375 --> 40:08.125
I see what it does to people.

40:08.208 --> 40:10.458
I can touch them
all the way from the stage.

40:10.542 --> 40:13.625
I can make them
laugh and

40:13.708 --> 40:16.625
and cry and fall in love.

40:16.708 --> 40:19.042
You can do that at home
just as well as here

40:19.125 --> 40:21.333
and you can get
better care too.

40:21.417 --> 40:23.000
It wouldn't make a difference.

40:23.083 --> 40:25.250
Good care or bad,
with the time I've got left

40:25.333 --> 40:26.917
it won't change much.

40:28.417 --> 40:31.083
'But the people you got living
in Downbelow, Steve..'

40:32.667 --> 40:35.417
...they're at the end
of their ropes

40:35.500 --> 40:39.167
maybe some of them,
the end of their lives.

40:39.250 --> 40:41.833
They came out here with hope,
and they saw it die

40:41.917 --> 40:43.625
right before their eyes.

40:44.958 --> 40:48.833
But they come
and they listen to me.

40:48.917 --> 40:50.792
And for a moment..

40:50.875 --> 40:54.417
...you can see
the hope in their eyes again.

40:54.500 --> 40:58.625
- 'I can make a difference.'
- Till you die.

40:58.708 --> 41:02.333
Yeah, but we are all gonna die
from something, huh.

41:07.208 --> 41:08.875
I-I just,
I just needed something

41:08.958 --> 41:10.500
to help me get through the pain.

41:10.583 --> 41:13.625
'And-and that's why
I-I took your card.'

41:15.208 --> 41:17.792
Don't send me away, Steve.

41:19.667 --> 41:21.583
I couldn't bear it.

41:23.542 --> 41:25.750
- Check results.
- Mm-hmm.

41:35.333 --> 41:36.625
You give her whatever she needs

41:36.708 --> 41:39.333
for as long as she needs it,
alright?

41:48.167 --> 41:50.833
- You're sure you're alright?
- I'm fine.

41:50.917 --> 41:52.583
Well, I'd still like
you to stop by Medlab

41:52.667 --> 41:55.333
and let them take
a look at you.

41:55.417 --> 41:58.333
Alright. I will.
Excuse me.

42:03.125 --> 42:07.750
Before, I told you
I don't have a piece of Kosh.

42:07.833 --> 42:10.167
But it's possible,
I don't know for sure

42:10.250 --> 42:14.250
but it may be
someone else does.
