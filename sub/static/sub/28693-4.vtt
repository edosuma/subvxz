- Most people say that,
   but they really don't get it.

40:29.823 --> 40:32.624
          But you've been there.

40:32.626 --> 40:34.125
             Does it get better?

40:34.127 --> 40:38.530
- It does, a little.

40:38.532 --> 40:41.833
My mom died when I was 13,

40:41.835 --> 40:45.470
and I was so angry at her
for leaving me.

40:45.472 --> 40:49.274
I didn't even try to understand
what she went through,

40:49.276 --> 40:51.176
to go to war
with your own brain,

40:51.178 --> 40:54.813
with your own body,
for control.

40:54.815 --> 40:57.215
I thought she just gave up.

40:58.785 --> 41:04.322
I didn't appreciate how hard
she fought to stay with me.

41:04.324 --> 41:07.992
Your mom, she fought
as hard as she could,

41:07.994 --> 41:11.229
and she left here thinking
how much she loves you.

41:12.999 --> 41:14.866
    - I'm trying to forgive her.

41:14.868 --> 41:16.801
- It's okay to be upset,

41:16.803 --> 41:20.338
furious even,

41:20.340 --> 41:23.174
but also try to remember
who she was

41:23.176 --> 41:25.543
before she started using.

41:26.746 --> 41:29.047
            - When I was little,

41:29.049 --> 41:31.049
            we used bake cookies
                    every Sunday

41:31.051 --> 41:34.652
                and dance around
                 in the kitchen.

41:34.654 --> 41:38.189
            That's how I'm gonna
            try to remember her.

41:38.191 --> 41:41.025
- I think she'd like that.

41:41.027 --> 41:43.495
                   - [sniffling]

41:43.497 --> 41:45.663
- [sniffling]
