00:02.239 --> 00:03.440
Both: Cheers!

00:03.540 --> 00:04.456
(Laughing)

00:04.508 --> 00:06.424
Mmm.

00:06.460 --> 00:09.094
Wow. I didn't know I liked tea so much.

00:09.129 --> 00:10.729
Dude, it's beer.

00:10.731 --> 00:13.932
I thought doing the girliest thing in
the world would help me understand women,

00:13.967 --> 00:16.117
but all I've learned is that little
chairs make my butt fall asleep.

00:16.170 --> 00:17.702
Seriously, Ben.

00:17.738 --> 00:19.771
I mean,
if you're still that miserable about Riley,

00:19.806 --> 00:21.506
why don't you just talk to her?

00:21.558 --> 00:23.775
Tell her how you feel. Man up!

00:23.810 --> 00:25.410
Snack cake?

00:25.445 --> 00:27.362
No, I did,

00:27.397 --> 00:29.247
but now we're in this weird limbo.

00:29.283 --> 00:31.449
I told her she needs to figure out if
she has feelings for my brother or not.

00:31.485 --> 00:33.385
- And does she?
- Who knows?

00:33.420 --> 00:36.154
It's not like she bothered
to tell me how she feels.

00:36.190 --> 00:37.355
I just feel stuck.

00:37.391 --> 00:40.125
Look, it sounds like you need
to take back control, okay?

00:40.160 --> 00:42.928
Become the master of your own destiny.

00:42.930 --> 00:44.629
Crumpet?

00:44.665 --> 00:46.998
You know, man? You're right.

00:47.034 --> 00:48.867
I'm done, okay?

00:48.902 --> 00:51.436
It's time to move on.
Riley and I need to be officially over.

00:52.673 --> 00:53.572
I'm stuck.

00:53.574 --> 00:55.373
I know. We get it.

00:55.409 --> 00:57.659
No, Tucker. I'm really stuck.

01:10.424 --> 01:14.142
All right, Emma.
Which one is pretty for grandma?

01:14.194 --> 01:15.193
Hmm?

01:15.229 --> 01:17.112
Oh! Aww.

01:17.147 --> 01:18.280
Knock, knock.

01:18.315 --> 01:20.282
Oh, hi.
Mrs. Wheeler, can I ask you a question?

01:20.317 --> 01:21.566
You just did. Now my turn.

01:21.618 --> 01:24.402
Which one of these says,

01:24.454 --> 01:28.323
"permission to board the S.S. Bonnie"?

01:28.375 --> 01:30.292
I'll assume that means "pretty."

01:30.327 --> 01:32.327
Um, I don't know.
What are you wearing it with?

01:32.379 --> 01:33.378
This.

01:33.413 --> 01:35.247
Oh, wow.

01:35.299 --> 01:37.282
I actually meant the shoes.

01:37.317 --> 01:39.334
I actually meant sex.

01:41.505 --> 01:43.588
Riley, it is fleet week.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.557
The Navy is in town,

01:45.592 --> 01:48.560
including one very sexy captain Hudson.

01:48.595 --> 01:51.429
We always meet at the same pier,

01:51.431 --> 01:53.481
and have the same magical weekend.

01:53.517 --> 01:55.483
Then, like all good magic tricks,

01:55.519 --> 01:57.569
he disappears.

01:59.239 --> 02:01.406
- That's so romantic.
- Yeah.

02:01.441 --> 02:03.408
I really want to talk to you and me and Ben.

02:03.443 --> 02:04.003
Ugh!

02:04.028 --> 02:06.244
He is the one who said
we should take a timeout

02:06.280 --> 02:09.281
because he had some crazy idea
that I have feelings for Danny.

02:09.316 --> 02:11.249
Me having feelings for Danny?

02:11.285 --> 02:12.417
That is just crazy, right?

02:12.452 --> 02:14.419
That's so crazy.
Don't you think that's crazy?

02:15.589 --> 02:17.222
Well, I would have agreed

02:17.257 --> 02:18.423
if you didn't say stuff like,

02:18.458 --> 02:19.457
"it's crazy, right?

02:19.509 --> 02:22.294
"So crazy!
I mean, don't you think it's crazy?"

02:22.346 --> 02:24.462
- (Baby laughs)
- (Mouths)

02:26.533 --> 02:30.185
Well,
I am telling you the same thing I told Ben.

02:30.220 --> 02:32.404
I do not have feelings for Danny!

02:33.423 --> 02:35.006
Danny, hey!

02:37.077 --> 02:38.109
Hey, Riles.

02:40.147 --> 02:41.913
See? Nothing.

02:41.948 --> 02:43.448
And you know what else?

02:43.450 --> 02:46.801
The next time I see Ben, I am telling
him that I want to get back together.

02:46.853 --> 02:47.802
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:47.854 --> 02:50.655
All right. Just don't make him cry.

02:50.657 --> 02:52.724
Otherwise, I'll do this again!

02:52.726 --> 02:54.659
Oh man.

02:54.661 --> 02:56.845
Look at it, Riley! This is your future!

03:00.500 --> 03:01.466
This one's on the house,

03:01.501 --> 03:03.268
especially if you come back to my house.

03:06.506 --> 03:08.106
Okay.

03:08.108 --> 03:09.541
Yeah, a little rusty.

03:09.593 --> 03:11.976
But it could have been worse.
I mean, at least she didn't laugh at you.

03:13.046 --> 03:14.879
Oh, wait, no. Now she's laughing at you.

03:16.016 --> 03:18.016
Hey, by the way,
whatever happened with Riley?

03:18.051 --> 03:19.384
How'd she take it?

03:19.419 --> 03:21.886
Well, she hasn't called me back,
so I'm guessing she'll take it fine.

03:21.922 --> 03:23.838
Ooh, I'm going back in.

03:23.890 --> 03:26.491
So, you looking for a stud?

03:26.526 --> 03:29.561
I already got the "S.T.D."
All I need is "U."

03:29.596 --> 03:30.712
Let me start again.

03:33.283 --> 03:35.333
Sadly, that was actually better.

03:35.369 --> 03:38.470
Yeah, but lucky for you, there's a ton
of cute girls in here to practice on.

03:40.407 --> 03:43.141
Oh, crap. I forgot it's fleet week.

03:43.143 --> 03:44.909
Damn it!

03:44.961 --> 03:46.978
We've been dock-blocked.

03:49.116 --> 03:50.832
Okay, people!

03:50.867 --> 03:52.934
The S.S. Bonnie just hit an iceberg.

03:54.087 --> 03:55.787
Hey, ma, how'd it go with your sailor?

03:55.822 --> 03:59.391
Terrible. Horrible. The worst.

03:59.393 --> 04:01.393
He wants to marry me!

04:03.330 --> 04:06.464
Okay, I normally don't get this
confused so early in the conversation.

04:07.834 --> 04:12.370
Danny, the reason you date a
sailor is because they sail away.

04:12.406 --> 04:14.272
Ben! Is Ben here?

04:14.324 --> 04:16.173
No, I think he's working a double.

04:16.209 --> 04:18.009
Why don't you just hashbrown him?

04:18.043 --> 04:21.012
You know?
That's what all you kids are doing.

04:25.085 --> 04:26.785
We keep missing each other,

04:26.820 --> 04:27.986
and I really want to talk to him in person.

04:28.021 --> 04:31.790
Plus... I seem to have lost my phone.

04:31.825 --> 04:34.626
Oh my God. I just shared a cab with a friend.
I must have left it there.

04:34.678 --> 04:36.261
Looking for this?

04:36.263 --> 04:37.562
Robyn! Oh, thank you!

04:37.597 --> 04:38.963
How did you know where I was?

04:38.999 --> 04:42.133
Well, you doodle "Ben Wheeler"
on your pad during every staff meeting.

04:42.185 --> 04:44.369
For a while,
I thought that Ben Wheeler was a legal term.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.439
Guys, this is Robyn.

04:47.474 --> 04:49.240
My office bestie.

04:49.276 --> 04:51.009
Hi, I'm Danny.

04:51.061 --> 04:52.911
The brother she apparently doesn't doodle.

04:52.946 --> 04:54.696
But she should.

04:54.748 --> 04:55.764
I'd doodle you.

04:57.851 --> 04:59.784
Okay, well...

04:59.820 --> 05:01.719
I've gotta go meet drink for a Ben.

05:01.755 --> 05:03.588
No, Ben for a drink!

05:03.623 --> 05:04.823
It was meety loving you.

05:04.858 --> 05:06.391
Lovely meeting me.

05:06.443 --> 05:08.460
You! I... I gotta go. Bye.

05:10.697 --> 05:12.664
Oh my God, is he single?

05:12.699 --> 05:14.499
And if he is, can I make him un-single?

05:15.535 --> 05:18.369
Well, uh, who? Danny? Single?

05:18.405 --> 05:20.271
I mean, not really. Sort of.

05:20.307 --> 05:24.075
Kind of, I guess.
I don't think he's ready to meet anyone new,

05:24.110 --> 05:26.010
so... no.

05:27.714 --> 05:29.781
Well,
maybe the right girl would make him ready.

05:29.816 --> 05:31.649
What's wrong with one coffee date?

05:31.685 --> 05:32.984
Yeah, Riley.

05:33.019 --> 05:34.719
Who doesn't love coffee?

05:37.440 --> 05:41.526
Unless, you have a problem with
somebody going out with Danny.

05:41.561 --> 05:44.529
Wait, no!

05:44.564 --> 05:47.198
(Mockingly) That's crazy! So crazy!
Don't you think it's crazy?

05:55.909 --> 05:59.611
I don't know, Tuck. I feel like we
should be on a box of frozen fish sticks.

05:59.646 --> 06:01.696
Don't worry, man. I got this.

06:01.731 --> 06:03.915
"In the Navy" is my go-to karaoke song.

06:03.917 --> 06:05.583
Oh, there.

06:06.736 --> 06:08.736
Hey, you guys better head back to the ship.

06:08.788 --> 06:10.421
Captain's looking for you.

06:10.423 --> 06:11.456
He knows what you did last night.

06:12.526 --> 06:14.459
They all did something last night.

06:15.629 --> 06:18.329
Hi, I'm seaman Tucker,
and this is private Benjamin.

06:18.365 --> 06:19.497
(Giggles) You said semen.

06:22.235 --> 06:23.868
We're in the Navy.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.220
There's a song about it.

06:25.272 --> 06:27.071
My job is to fire the torpedoes.

06:27.107 --> 06:28.239
Yeah, it's pretty badass.

06:28.241 --> 06:29.240
(Mimics Cannon firing)

06:29.242 --> 06:31.893
- Whoa!
- Riley, hey!

06:31.945 --> 06:33.144
Ben, what are you doing?

06:33.196 --> 06:35.647
Management thought it would be
a fun promotion for fleet week.

06:35.682 --> 06:37.649
Chips, ahoy, mattes!

06:37.684 --> 06:39.651
I'm so sorry that I haven't
called you back yet.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.786
But, I really want to talk to you, too.
About us.

06:41.821 --> 06:43.721
- You do?
- Yes! So much.

06:43.757 --> 06:45.657
But, uh, hey, can we do it later?
After your shift?

06:45.692 --> 06:47.392
Okay, yeah, sure. Later's better.

06:47.444 --> 06:48.626
Later's good. I like later. Here's to later!

06:51.298 --> 06:53.031
What was that? I thought you were moving on?

06:53.066 --> 06:54.432
Yeah, no, I thought I was too,

06:54.467 --> 06:56.234
but maybe I jumped ship too soon.

06:56.269 --> 06:57.535
She said she wants to talk.

06:57.571 --> 06:59.904
And I can be talked out of my
talk and talked into her talk

06:59.940 --> 07:01.839
if her talk is about us
getting back together!

07:01.875 --> 07:03.892
What are you talking about?

07:03.927 --> 07:07.679
Dude, if she wanted to get back together,
she would have said it.

07:07.714 --> 07:09.948
Face it, Ben. That ship has sailed.

07:09.983 --> 07:12.617
I don't mean to eavesdrop, sailor,

07:12.652 --> 07:14.385
but I think your friend is right.

07:14.421 --> 07:16.654
When a woman says she wants to talk,

07:16.690 --> 07:18.656
it always means she wants to walk.

07:20.377 --> 07:22.126
I'm not ready to be set up, right now.

07:22.162 --> 07:24.128
Okay.

07:24.164 --> 07:25.330
Will you be ready, tomorrow?

07:25.382 --> 07:27.999
Please? It would mean so much to me.

07:28.034 --> 07:29.901
Fine. Set away.

07:32.822 --> 07:34.105
Yeah,
I guess if she wanted to get back together,

07:34.140 --> 07:35.773
she'd be hugging me, instead of my brother.

07:35.809 --> 07:37.859
I hate being right about these things,

07:37.894 --> 07:41.696
except when a cute sailor
like yourself is now single.

07:41.731 --> 07:42.730
Can I buy you a drink?

07:45.685 --> 07:47.285
Yeah, that'd be great.

07:48.288 --> 07:50.588
So, you looking for a stud?

07:50.624 --> 07:52.390
I've already got "U," I just need an "S"...

07:52.425 --> 07:54.158
no, damn it, that doesn't work either.

07:57.021 --> 07:58.508
Riley: <i>Mrs. Wheeler?</i>

07:58.608 --> 08:01.126
Oh, Riley. Thank God that you're here.

08:01.226 --> 08:02.392
I can't go home!

08:02.444 --> 08:06.430
Captain Clingy has been
staking out my lobby all day!

08:06.465 --> 08:10.367
Well,
I have successfully set up Danny and Robyn,

08:10.419 --> 08:13.303
thus proving I have no feelings for Danny,

08:13.355 --> 08:16.356
thus in your face, Mrs. Wheeler!

08:16.392 --> 08:20.827
You're right, Riley. You obviously
have no feelings for Danny, whatsoever,

08:20.863 --> 08:23.830
and are completely focused on
your relationship with Ben.

08:23.866 --> 08:26.917
Hey, Riles. Thanks so much for
convincing me to go out with Robyn.

08:26.969 --> 08:29.519
We spent, like,
two hours on the phone last night.

08:29.571 --> 08:31.538
And that was before I fell
asleep and had to call her back.

08:33.409 --> 08:34.741
I like this girl.

08:34.743 --> 08:36.576
I'm actually meeting her at the bar,
right now, so don't wait up.

08:42.284 --> 08:44.000
- So, this is me...
- Mm-hmm.

08:44.035 --> 08:47.287
Watching my friend Danny go out
the door to be with another woman.

08:47.322 --> 08:50.957
Please note my complete lack of reaction.

08:52.127 --> 08:54.728
You have really nice pores.

08:54.763 --> 08:57.731
(Phone buzzes)

08:57.766 --> 08:58.799
Oh.

08:58.851 --> 09:01.601
Hey, bestie!
I hear you're off to meet my boy?

09:01.653 --> 09:03.670
<i>Oh my God, yes! Thank you!</i>

09:03.705 --> 09:05.472
<i>I just broke up with my ex two weeks ago,</i>

09:05.474 --> 09:08.241
<i>and I've been in desperate need of
a rebound to help me get over him.</i>

09:08.277 --> 09:10.544
I'm sorry. I think we have a bad connection.

09:10.579 --> 09:12.312
It sounded like you just said "rebound"?

09:12.347 --> 09:14.231
<i>Yeah.
I'll tell you all about it at work tomorrow.</i>

09:14.266 --> 09:17.017
<i>Unless I take a very personal day.</i>

09:17.052 --> 09:17.984
<i>Bye!</i>

09:18.020 --> 09:19.319
Oh my God.

09:19.354 --> 09:21.238
No, no, no, no!

09:21.290 --> 09:22.756
I have to warn Danny!

09:22.758 --> 09:25.192
I mean, if he finds out he's a rebound,
it'll break his heart.

09:25.227 --> 09:28.044
And, you know, somehow,
he's gonna find a way to blame me.

09:29.998 --> 09:32.749
Oh! Break his heart!

09:32.801 --> 09:34.684
Oh, why didn't I think of that?

09:34.736 --> 09:36.436
Oh, uh-huh.

09:37.506 --> 09:38.538
Oh, hey, captain.

09:38.590 --> 09:40.307
Listen, we need to talk.

09:40.342 --> 09:43.210
Yeah, I know you're in the lobby.
I'll be right down.

09:47.082 --> 09:48.265
Hey, that's Charlotte.

09:48.300 --> 09:51.151
She's been begging me to
give her a tour of the ship.

09:51.186 --> 09:53.220
Hey, by the way,
what have you been calling it?

09:53.255 --> 09:55.922
The only ships I know
are Titanic and Lollipop.

09:57.092 --> 09:58.058
Oh, Riley's here.

09:58.060 --> 09:59.926
Have you guys made your breakup official?

09:59.962 --> 10:01.962
No, and I owe it to her
to tell her I've moved on.

10:02.014 --> 10:03.647
She obviously has, too.

10:03.682 --> 10:05.699
Riley, hey. So, about us...

10:05.751 --> 10:07.767
oh, yes, which I so want to talk about.

10:07.803 --> 10:08.819
Right now, I have to find your brother.

10:08.854 --> 10:10.537
I think he's in the bathroom.

10:10.572 --> 10:12.506
Wait, Riley. This is stupid.

10:12.558 --> 10:15.375
I know what you want to talk about,
and I've thought about it,

10:15.410 --> 10:16.476
and I agree with you.

10:16.512 --> 10:19.246
Really? You do?

10:19.281 --> 10:21.414
Took me a while to get there, but yeah,

10:21.450 --> 10:23.150
I think that we both know this is right.

10:23.185 --> 10:25.018
Oh my God.

10:25.053 --> 10:27.087
You have no idea how nervous I was.

10:27.089 --> 10:28.855
I mean, I didn't know what to say.

10:28.857 --> 10:30.874
I didn't know if it was going to be awkward,

10:30.926 --> 10:32.058
but why should it be, right?

10:32.094 --> 10:33.109
Exactly.

10:34.763 --> 10:36.930
I love that we can just
go right back to being us.

10:36.932 --> 10:38.031
You're amazing.

10:38.066 --> 10:40.600
Oh, well, uh, I'll see you after your shift?

10:40.636 --> 10:41.902
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:41.937 --> 10:43.436
I have to go talk to your brother.

10:47.676 --> 10:49.326
How'd it go?

10:49.361 --> 10:50.310
It's over.

10:50.345 --> 10:52.229
Riley and I are officially broken up.

10:52.264 --> 10:56.199
Oh my God,
Ben and I are officially back together!

10:56.251 --> 10:57.434
But enough about me.

10:57.469 --> 10:59.236
I need to talk to you about...

10:59.271 --> 11:01.338
Robyn! Hi!

11:01.373 --> 11:04.140
We were just talking
about how awesome you are.

11:04.193 --> 11:05.892
Thanks.

11:05.928 --> 11:07.727
What are you doing here?

11:07.779 --> 11:10.630
Oh, well, you know, just thought
I'd grab a quick bite with you guys.

11:10.666 --> 11:13.633
Maybe help smooth over
some awkward silences.

11:13.669 --> 11:16.469
First dates can be pretty trying, so...

11:17.806 --> 11:19.673
And then she gives me a goodbye kiss.

11:19.708 --> 11:21.558
Are we doing that now? Is that a thing?

11:21.593 --> 11:22.609
When did that start?

11:22.611 --> 11:26.179
Dude, moving on, remember?

11:26.215 --> 11:29.382
The best way to get over one
girl is to get under another.

11:29.418 --> 11:31.084
I suggest the one from yesterday.

11:31.119 --> 11:33.153
She's right there.

11:33.205 --> 11:35.989
She'll help you move on,
and me move on to that ship.

11:36.024 --> 11:37.190
How can she do that?

11:37.226 --> 11:39.192
See those little stripy
thingies on her shoulder?

11:39.228 --> 11:40.894
She's an officer.

11:40.929 --> 11:43.914
If we're with her,
no one's gonna ask any questions.

11:43.966 --> 11:45.799
Then I think I need to get on board.

11:45.834 --> 11:47.517
All right, Tucker.

11:47.569 --> 11:49.753
Pull up your anchor, we're going in.

11:49.788 --> 11:52.556
No, seriously, man. Your zipper's down.

11:52.608 --> 11:53.640
I got it.

11:55.344 --> 11:58.361
Bonnie, I just don't understand
why you won't marry me?

11:58.413 --> 11:59.412
We're so good together.

11:59.448 --> 12:01.448
Look, Randy, it's not you,

12:01.483 --> 12:02.399
it's me.

12:02.434 --> 12:04.234
Well, then I'm willing to work on you.

12:04.286 --> 12:06.319
Okay, let's try this again.

12:06.355 --> 12:08.104
Here.

12:08.156 --> 12:11.091
Look, you were just a rebound to me.

12:11.126 --> 12:14.728
Yeah, that's right.
I got dumped by another Navy man,

12:14.763 --> 12:18.732
and you are just a painful reminder.

12:18.767 --> 12:22.736
A sexy, slightly stalkery reminder.

12:24.423 --> 12:25.555
- Okay then.
- Yeah.

12:25.591 --> 12:27.674
Well,
I guess there's really nothing I can do.

12:31.246 --> 12:32.178
Buh-bye.

12:34.283 --> 12:36.316
What the...

12:36.351 --> 12:37.284
what are you...

12:37.319 --> 12:39.369
- hey, see that officer over there?
- Yeah.

12:39.421 --> 12:41.271
Wanted me to give you his number.

12:41.323 --> 12:44.924
Oh! Oh my gosh, thank you so much!

12:47.062 --> 12:48.762
That's what I love about fleet week.

12:48.797 --> 12:51.648
You can jump one ship,
and land right on another.

12:53.602 --> 12:54.534
That was him, wasn't it?

12:54.569 --> 12:55.518
Who was what?

12:55.554 --> 12:56.736
The guy. The guy you're in love with?

12:56.772 --> 12:58.471
- Sure, why not.
- I'm gonna kill him.

12:58.507 --> 13:00.307
Uh, what?

13:02.952 --> 13:04.769
And that's when I realize.

13:04.869 --> 13:07.436
"Hey, I'm in Toronto!"

13:08.539 --> 13:10.473
Oh, and you will not guess
what happens after that.

13:10.508 --> 13:12.375
The story ended and you went home?

13:12.410 --> 13:14.410
Ooh, home! What a good idea.

13:14.479 --> 13:17.179
How about you and I go back to your
place as soon as I finish this?

13:21.436 --> 13:23.202
Oh look, you're done!

13:23.237 --> 13:24.253
No, no, no, no, no.

13:24.288 --> 13:26.889
You two are not going anywhere.

13:26.924 --> 13:27.940
This next round's on me.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.227
Hello, another round, please.

13:32.930 --> 13:33.979
Thank you.

13:38.569 --> 13:39.769
Question.

13:39.804 --> 13:43.472
What is your return policy on beer?

13:50.281 --> 13:51.547
I'm surprised I've never seen you before.

13:51.549 --> 13:53.516
I realize there are
thousands of men on board,

13:53.518 --> 13:56.168
but I feel like I would have noticed you,
right?

13:56.204 --> 13:59.071
I usually stay in the back.

14:01.042 --> 14:04.860
Well,
maybe it's time to promote you to the front?

14:04.862 --> 14:06.862
Tucker: Ben! Ben, where are you?

14:06.898 --> 14:08.864
Tucker?

14:08.900 --> 14:10.032
- Tucker, what are you...
- Oh God, Ben!

14:10.067 --> 14:11.967
Ben, you gotta hide me, man.

14:12.003 --> 14:13.669
There's a crazy man chasing me.

14:15.606 --> 14:16.622
Tucker?

14:16.674 --> 14:17.840
Ooh, I'll be back for you, later.

14:20.411 --> 14:22.411
Tucker? Oh, Tucker! There you are.

14:22.447 --> 14:24.513
Okay,
I just wanna give you a little heads up.

14:24.549 --> 14:26.565
My ex-boyfriend wants to kill you,

14:26.617 --> 14:29.468
and he knows how to do it 18 different ways.

14:29.504 --> 14:33.405
Oh, great, so I can pick how I want to die.
Cool.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.057
(Banging at the door)

14:35.092 --> 14:36.492
Captain: Open this door immediately!

14:36.527 --> 14:39.128
Amber, I hope we're not moving too fast,
but I'd like you to meet my mom.

14:40.815 --> 14:43.065
And, it would be super helpful if you
could hide her and my best friend.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.700
(Banging continues)

14:44.735 --> 14:46.735
Okay, just hide in the bunks.
I'll get rid of him.

14:46.771 --> 14:48.537
(Banging intensifies)

14:49.907 --> 14:50.923
What is the meaning of this, sail...

14:50.975 --> 14:52.641
oh my God! Captain, sir.

14:52.693 --> 14:55.594
I am so sorry, sir.
I didn't realize it was you, sir.

14:55.630 --> 14:56.846
I'm looking for a gutless traitor.

14:58.382 --> 14:59.515
I haven't seen anyone, sir.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.317
How about I just check the rack myself.

15:01.352 --> 15:03.486
Sorry, sir. I was just checking the beds.

15:03.488 --> 15:05.588
Excellent corners, officer.

15:05.623 --> 15:07.473
There's no one else in here, sir.

15:07.508 --> 15:10.993
Perhaps,
whoever you're looking for is in the back.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.074

15:25.977 --> 15:28.494
Hey, honey bunny.

15:28.529 --> 15:30.412
What are you doing here?

15:31.432 --> 15:32.715
What do you know about this, sailor?

15:32.750 --> 15:34.450
Probably less than you do, sir.

15:34.452 --> 15:35.551
Look, let me explain.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.219
Actually, you know what, I can explain.

15:37.221 --> 15:39.321
Actually, there's really nothing to explain.

15:39.357 --> 15:42.391
Because I'm actually not even in the Navy.

15:42.443 --> 15:45.878
Look, "Carrie's costume castle."

15:45.930 --> 15:47.947
Yeah, that's right.

15:47.982 --> 15:51.100
See, you have no power over
me because I'm a civilian.

15:51.135 --> 15:53.002
Also known as a taxpayer,

15:53.037 --> 15:56.038
which, technically,
makes me in charge of you.

15:59.810 --> 16:02.378
Yeah. It doesn't work like that.

16:02.413 --> 16:03.579
Oh, yeah? Well, you know some...

16:07.518 --> 16:10.185
so, what time does the
buffet start on this thing?

16:10.221 --> 16:12.288
And, do I need a wrist band?
I mean, how does it work?

16:12.323 --> 16:14.123
I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out.

16:16.260 --> 16:19.295
Okay, I am so, so, so sorry about that.

16:19.330 --> 16:21.130
It happens every fleet week.

16:21.182 --> 16:22.331
You kinda just gotta roll with it.

16:22.366 --> 16:26.218
Well, I'm ready to roll.

16:26.254 --> 16:27.836
How 'bout you?

16:34.545 --> 16:36.845
You know what?
I'm so sorry, I don't think I can do this.

16:38.699 --> 16:40.449
Girl at the bar?

16:40.484 --> 16:42.685
I shouldn't have just let her walk away.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.386
I have to go fight for her.

16:44.422 --> 16:47.456
May I say, she's a really lucky girl.

16:47.491 --> 16:50.225
Thank you so much for understanding.

16:50.261 --> 16:53.228
I just hope it's not too late.

16:53.230 --> 16:56.065
Oh, and just so you know,
I'm not really a sailor, either.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.066
Oh, I know.

16:57.101 --> 16:59.034
We don't call it "the back."

17:02.707 --> 17:03.973
(Door rattling)

17:04.008 --> 17:05.040
Hey, guys!

17:05.076 --> 17:07.492
It's Riley.

17:07.528 --> 17:09.845
Uh, I was just stopping by
to see how the date's going?

17:09.880 --> 17:11.714
Danny, do you maybe wanna step out here,

17:11.749 --> 17:13.549
and have a quick, private chat about it?

17:15.553 --> 17:16.585
Excuse me for a minute.

17:22.310 --> 17:23.275
Hi.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.295
What the hell is going on?

17:26.329 --> 17:28.430
What's so important that you
have to interrupt my date?

17:28.432 --> 17:29.365
Twice?

17:29.417 --> 17:31.216
Oh, okay, calm down.

17:31.252 --> 17:34.903
I just came here to warn you that
Robyn is just using you as a rebound

17:34.939 --> 17:35.904
to get over her ex.

17:35.906 --> 17:37.806
I know. I'm fine with it.

17:37.842 --> 17:38.874
We talked about it last night.

17:38.909 --> 17:40.776
Seriously, what's going on?

17:40.778 --> 17:42.711
How come every time I
have a girl in my life,

17:42.763 --> 17:43.879
you get over-protective and weird?

17:43.914 --> 17:45.864
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do!

17:45.916 --> 17:47.666
You kind of act like a jealous girlfriend.

17:47.718 --> 17:50.352
Oh, well, I'm sorry. That's what friends do.

17:50.404 --> 17:51.453
They protect each other.

17:51.455 --> 17:53.288
No, friends are supportive!

17:53.324 --> 17:54.390
But you, with...

17:54.425 --> 17:57.209
With Milena, Amy, and Georgie...

17:57.244 --> 17:58.494
it's like no one's ever good enough for me.

17:58.529 --> 18:00.396
I just care about you.

18:00.431 --> 18:03.415
And if you cared about me,
you'd stop doing whatever the hell this is.

18:03.467 --> 18:05.100
Danny, I just...

18:05.102 --> 18:06.235
what? You got feelings for me now?

18:08.005 --> 18:11.106
No. Exactly. So, let me get back to my date.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.843
- Danny...
- What?

18:22.570 --> 18:24.420
I do have feelings for you.

18:26.774 --> 18:27.723
Oh my God.

18:40.271 --> 18:41.987
- You got my message.
- Yeah.

18:42.023 --> 18:43.372
Can we talk?

18:43.374 --> 18:45.107
I mean, really talk.

18:45.142 --> 18:47.142
I would love to talk.

18:47.144 --> 18:49.812
Oh, I don't even know where to start.

18:49.847 --> 18:52.081
Then let me go first, okay?

18:52.116 --> 18:54.850
I've been having second thoughts
about our conversation, all day.

18:54.885 --> 18:56.802
Really?

18:56.837 --> 18:58.737
Oh my God, I've been too.

18:58.773 --> 19:00.656
I think we made a big mistake.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.592
I'm sorry. Can you forgive me?

19:03.627 --> 19:05.761
Forgive you?

19:05.796 --> 19:08.430
Of course.

19:08.466 --> 19:10.766
So then, we agree it's...

19:10.801 --> 19:12.534
It's best if we break up for good.

19:12.570 --> 19:14.403
Yeah, I...

19:16.424 --> 19:18.207
wait, what?

19:19.443 --> 19:21.376
Well, you were right.

19:21.412 --> 19:23.112
This...

19:24.348 --> 19:25.514
This was a mistake.

19:27.201 --> 19:29.334
I think I loved you for so long

19:29.370 --> 19:33.055
I actually willed you into loving me back.

19:33.107 --> 19:37.025
You know what?
I just took you along for my ride.

19:37.061 --> 19:39.228
And the truth is,

19:39.230 --> 19:41.363
we'll always be better as friends.

19:44.368 --> 19:46.034
You agree, right?

19:47.288 --> 19:49.288
Yeah.

19:49.323 --> 19:51.073
Friends. Totally.

19:53.043 --> 19:54.376
Well...

19:54.411 --> 19:57.412
I'm kind of proud of us that
we can be so mature about this.

19:57.414 --> 20:00.082
(Sighs)

20:00.134 --> 20:03.252
I guess, maybe that's what happens
when you really love someone.

20:05.339 --> 20:06.472
I love you, Ben.

20:10.144 --> 20:11.260
I love you, too.

20:15.266 --> 20:18.735
