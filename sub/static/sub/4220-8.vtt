WEBVTT

00:00.876 --> 00:02.293
Vegas was great.

00:02.378 --> 00:03.503
I got married.

00:03.962 --> 00:05.755
Hey, everybody,
this is Brittany.

00:06.215 --> 00:09.342
Our home is your home,
and that makes it her home.

00:10.052 --> 00:11.344
We don't even
know who she is.

00:11.428 --> 00:12.720
He doesn't even know
who she is.

00:12.805 --> 00:14.806
All right, ladies!

00:14.890 --> 00:16.182
Pump those arms!

00:18.185 --> 00:20.103
What's it gonna take
to keep you
quiet about this?

00:20.396 --> 00:22.522
I'd just like to
understand why our baby

00:22.606 --> 00:24.232
has been put on the
high-risk category.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.113
Heart rate's good.
BP's good.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.032
Have you experienced any
bleeding or unusual pain?

00:33.492 --> 00:35.702
My ankles tend to swell
up like water balloons.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.247
Other than that,
I feel fine.
It's perfectly normal.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.874
Are you ready to see how
the little one's doing?
Absolutely.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.543
We've been counting
down the days.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.294
Well, let's take a look.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.758
Oh, my goodness.

00:51.927 --> 00:53.136
Would you
look at that.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.471
Looks like
you have a beautiful,
healthy baby.

00:55.681 --> 00:56.806
There's its heart.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.725
Right here's an arm.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.435
Oh!

01:00.519 --> 01:02.103
See how the baby's
on its side?

01:02.187 --> 01:03.771
Yeah.

01:04.106 --> 01:06.649
So, what do we think?
Would you like to know
the sex?

01:07.109 --> 01:08.568
No.
Yes, please.

01:08.861 --> 01:09.986
Not quite yet.

01:11.155 --> 01:12.488
Yeah, we'll wait.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.160
You know what?

01:17.244 --> 01:19.078
Would you two mind
hanging tight for a bit?

01:19.163 --> 01:21.330
There's something I'd like
to check before you go.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.082
Of course.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.333
Is everything okay?

01:24.835 --> 01:27.670
Let me just run a few tests.
We'll take it from there.

01:36.805 --> 01:37.805
Wow!

01:39.016 --> 01:41.142
I thought I knew
everything, but...

01:43.771 --> 01:45.688
Ah, damn. I...
I gotta get a shower.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.315
I gotta get to work.
Wait, what?

01:47.399 --> 01:49.275
Yeah.
Today's shift day?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.610
Yeah.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.153
Two off, one on.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.363
No. No! No! No!
What if you, uh...

01:55.532 --> 01:57.074
What if you call in sick?

01:57.493 --> 02:00.411
I mean, there's this...
There's this amazing,

02:00.496 --> 02:02.205
amazing burger place

02:02.581 --> 02:06.209
just down the corner
from work where
Rush and State meet.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.877
I can't do it.
Yes!

02:08.045 --> 02:09.670
I gotta go to work!

02:09.755 --> 02:11.380
Okay. Okay, okay.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.633
Do me a favor, okay?

02:13.717 --> 02:14.717
Anything.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.844
Promise me you'll
be safe out there?

02:16.929 --> 02:18.513
Don't worry.
I'll be fine.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.723
No, that's not a promise.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.642
That is not a... Hey!

02:23.352 --> 02:24.811
That's not a promise.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.730
I'll be fine. I promise.

02:50.379 --> 02:51.379
So...

02:51.588 --> 02:52.588
So...

03:00.639 --> 03:02.056
You wanna talk to him?

03:02.683 --> 03:03.850
You made this bed.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.309
You can change the sheets.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.115
It's called
placenta previa.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.869
Puts Donna in
high risk of a...

03:24.288 --> 03:26.789
Life-threatening hemorrhage
in her third trimester.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.583
Damn it.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.167
All right, that's terrible.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.880
How's she holding up?

03:34.882 --> 03:36.716
We left the appointment
in a daze.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.217
Haven't spoken since.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.640
I can tell you from
experience, Chief,

03:45.684 --> 03:47.059
all you can do

03:47.144 --> 03:49.103
is you put your
arm around her

03:49.563 --> 03:52.106
and you tell her
everything is gonna
be okay.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.734
It's all we can do.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.904
Herrmann, what if it's
not gonna be okay?

04:16.173 --> 04:17.882
Psst.
Oh, my God!

04:18.008 --> 04:19.800
Hey.
You scared the crap
out of me.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.011
You, uh, left this at
my class last night.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.513
Oh. Thank you.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.307
Oh, and also,
I just wanna give you
a piece of advice.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.808
You know, during this part?

04:27.893 --> 04:29.352
You're bringing your
shoulders up a little bit.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.728
So, what you wanna do
is you wanna just...

04:32.064 --> 04:33.314
Knock, knock.
Hey.

04:33.565 --> 04:36.025
Uh, are Cruz
and Brett...

04:39.905 --> 04:40.905
Oh.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.164
What do you know.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.250
Uh, what's up?
Dawson said that
you wanted to talk to me.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.044
Yeah.
Come here for a sec.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.131
What's this for?

04:59.216 --> 05:00.800
Thought you'd
need a recharge

05:00.884 --> 05:02.385
after your workout
this morning.

05:02.552 --> 05:03.761
Oh. Uh...

05:04.596 --> 05:06.430
You guys heard that?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.642
Pretty sure half of
Milwaukee heard that.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.560
Uh, we'll try to
keep it down.

05:12.229 --> 05:15.982
Hey, um, I don't wanna put
pressure on you, but, uh,

05:16.066 --> 05:18.234
have you guys
thought about plans?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.318
For?

05:23.407 --> 05:25.491
They've got it on TV
right now.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.702
Come quick,
Lieutenant, you're gonna
want to see this!

05:27.828 --> 05:29.829
- ...over on the west side.
- What's going on?

05:29.913 --> 05:31.163
We're looking at
live footage

05:31.248 --> 05:33.207
of a mid-air
helicopter explosion

05:33.291 --> 05:34.917
that took place
moments ago.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.962
The cause of that explosion
is currently unknown.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.673
Sources are reporting the
aircraft displayed signs

05:40.799 --> 05:42.133
of distress mid-air
in the midst of...

05:43.260 --> 05:46.137
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Agent 51,

05:46.221 --> 05:48.389
Ambulance 61, Battalion 25,

05:48.473 --> 05:50.349
Truck 70, Ambulance 96.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.025
Hey, guys,
these choppers carry

05:59.109 --> 06:01.527
300-gallon fuel tanks,
so let's assume the worst.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.612
Everybody grab an
extinguisher, you got it?

06:03.697 --> 06:04.697
Copy that.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.449
Newhouse, you
bring the K-12 saw.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.200
Tony, Capp,
jaws and cutters.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.702
Got it, Lieutenant.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.788
Stay focused!

06:13.749 --> 06:16.042
Listen, things might
look a little hairy
when we get there.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.586
Just take one
patient at a time.
We'll get through this.

06:18.670 --> 06:19.837
Roger that.

06:21.465 --> 06:23.007
Hey, can I ask
you a question?

06:24.134 --> 06:27.511
Say you and someone
in the house had a...

06:28.305 --> 06:29.388
Secret.

06:29.598 --> 06:30.598
Okay.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.601
And you didn't really
see any reason for it
to be a secret.

06:35.437 --> 06:36.854
Well, look.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.440
In my experience,
in-house relationships

06:39.524 --> 06:41.358
are better kept
out in the open,

06:41.443 --> 06:43.402
rather than have people
guessing about it.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.613
Wait. No, it's not
that kind of, um...

06:46.281 --> 06:47.323
Hold up.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.158
Who'd you
date in-house?

06:53.830 --> 06:54.955
Whoa, mama.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.863
Okay, everyone,
listen up.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.782
I want a full evacuation.

07:29.866 --> 07:33.119
Every one of these buildings
is going to be checked out
and emptied out, right now.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.620
Designate that
area for triage.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.330
Squad 3, get on
top of that building.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.499
Secure the fuselage,
check for survivors.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.583
Right away, Chief.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.502
Cruz, bring Severide
the aerial.

07:41.586 --> 07:42.920
Casey.
Yeah.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.214
We got smoke and
fuel coming out
of that building.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.340
Get everybody out.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.634
And locate where that
rotor went, see what
kind of damage it did.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.718
Yes, sir.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.846
Nobody's on
anybody's
hip today.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.347
Everyone needs
to step up.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.558
Herrmann, Otis,
find that rotor.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.268
Everyone else,
follow me.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.353
All right, let's go!

08:18.039 --> 08:19.331
Is that the transmission?

08:19.416 --> 08:20.416
Looks to be.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.132
Come out.
Come on.
Move it!

08:29.759 --> 08:30.801
Stairs are shot.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.595
Mouch, you and
Cruz bring ladders.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.096
Check the upper floors.
Dawson,

08:34.181 --> 08:35.723
take the ground floor,
I'll take the basement.

08:35.807 --> 08:36.807
Got it.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.438
Hey, guys, let's
make this quick.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.148
We're walking
on thin ice here.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.318
Hey!

08:48.528 --> 08:50.946
Stop moving!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Sir, stop!

08:55.035 --> 08:56.493
Listen to me.
What's your name?

08:56.745 --> 08:58.370
Frank.
Frank, okay.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.622
You're sitting
right on the edge.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.081
You can't move
another inch, okay?

09:01.166 --> 09:02.291
No movement.
Okay.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.418
Okay. Are you hurt?
No.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.502
What about you, ma'am?

09:05.587 --> 09:07.713
The seat, it's
crushing my leg.

09:08.256 --> 09:11.133
Okay, just sit tight.
We're gonna get you
guys out of there.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.971
Hey, we're gonna need
to secure this thing
before we cut into it.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.556
Use that AC unit as
an anchoring point.

09:17.641 --> 09:18.599
You got it?
Got it.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.768
Let's move on this,
double time. Come on.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.395
Hey, Chief, I got a
pilot and two passengers
alive and well.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.980
That's the good news.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.857
Bad news is I don't know
how much time we got up here.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.317
This roof seems
really unstable.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.485
Okay, you do what you can.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.569
Report back.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.112
Copy that, Chief.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.575
How am I? Please.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.621
We're gonna take
good care of you.

09:41.623 --> 09:42.831
Is it bad?

09:43.959 --> 09:46.001
Tell me.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.046
Put a good thought
in your head, okay?

09:49.130 --> 09:50.214
Your family, your friends,

09:50.298 --> 09:51.966
the best thing
you can think of and
just hold on to that.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.050
Brett.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.426
I know.
Come on.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.183
You okay?

10:01.268 --> 10:02.476
Yeah. What's next?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.520
Ambulance 65 just
brought a newcomer.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.776
Chief Boden?

10:11.736 --> 10:13.487
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to
ask you to step back

10:13.571 --> 10:14.947
behind these lines
and stay there.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.949
I... I'm
Kelly Severide's wife.
I'm Brittany.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.450
I'm so sorry,
but I thought I
heard his voice

10:18.535 --> 10:19.868
on your radio, and
I really just... I...

10:19.995 --> 10:21.829
I need to just...
You know what you
need to do?

10:21.913 --> 10:24.206
Is you need to remove
yourself from the area,

10:25.583 --> 10:27.293
and you let your
husband do his job.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.466
Herrmann, what's your status?

10:35.760 --> 10:37.886
Looks like that dang rotor
rolled all the way through

10:37.971 --> 10:39.471
the neighborhood
like a wagon wheel.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.348
But I think we're
closing in on it.

10:41.725 --> 10:42.850
Herrmann.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.566
Hold on. We're gonna
get you out of here.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.947
Give me your halligan!

10:59.034 --> 11:01.410
Go grab one of those stumps,
drag it over here.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.912
Okay. You're all right.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.789
I got you.
All right?

11:10.503 --> 11:12.755
Where do you
want this?
Quick, come over here.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.007
Pull up on it.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.557
All right,
you know what?
Try to pull her out.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.186
It's still
too heavy.
Yeah.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.854
We're gonna have to
disassemble the whole thing.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.773
You think you can
hold this while
I go get the tool bag?

11:30.857 --> 11:31.982
Go.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.070
Hey. Listen!

11:36.488 --> 11:37.863
Look at me, all right?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.031
Can you breathe
a little now?

11:39.115 --> 11:40.866
Okay.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.453
Nice piece of jewelry
you got here.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.750
Please, don't
make me laugh.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.210
All right, sorry.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.711
Enough with the funny
business, right?

11:54.631 --> 11:56.715
Hey, Lieutenant,
we located the rotor.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.467
We got a victim
pinned under it.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.427
Pulling her out now.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.054
Here, go with him.

12:04.766 --> 12:05.808
Roger that, Herrmann.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.353
Oh, Mills.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.480
Check out this van.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.079
Oh, man.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.874
It's stuck.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.334
So is this.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.753
Sir? Can you hear me?

12:35.880 --> 12:38.132
He's losing a lot of blood.
We need to get in
and help him.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.299
Chief, this is Brett.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.176
We need assistance
with a pinned-in victim.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.928
Copy 61, stand by.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.430
To hell with
standing by.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.812
Upstairs is all clear.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.230
Any sign of Dawson?

12:54.441 --> 12:55.941
It's pitch black in there.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.862
Dawson, report.

13:00.655 --> 13:01.655
Lieutenant?

13:04.576 --> 13:06.034
It's not her.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.579
I can't breathe.

13:09.706 --> 13:10.706
What happened?

13:12.167 --> 13:14.960
The firefighter who gave
me the mask, she fell.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.004
Get her clear.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.215
Dawson, report.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.345
Dawson!

13:35.690 --> 13:36.773
I'm going in!

13:46.534 --> 13:48.076
Never give up your mask!

13:50.580 --> 13:52.039
The floor above collapsed.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.167
My legs got pinned,
and I had to get her out.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.835
Here.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.048
Get over to triage.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.759
Mmm-mmm. I'm fine.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.597
Okay, yeah, okay.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.102
Dawson.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.148
Nice work.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.236
Chief, this is 81.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.071
We finished our
primary search.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.948
We're gonna go
in for another pass.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.282
Make it a quick one.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.534
Copy that.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.743
Herrmann,
what's your status?

14:30.411 --> 14:31.537
Hanging in there, Chief.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.413
We got a lady
pinned under the rotor.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.499
We're gonna need
a few minutes, but,

14:35.583 --> 14:37.501
if you got paramedics
and you can spare them,

14:37.585 --> 14:39.795
send them over.
Copy. Stand by.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.129
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

14:42.924 --> 14:45.050
Pssh. Come on.
You kidding me?

14:45.343 --> 14:47.177
This kind of thing
happens all the time.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.887
Yesterday it
happened twice.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.723
We're going to pop you
out of there lickety-split.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.016
How we looking?

14:53.726 --> 14:56.144
There's a lot of bolts.
This thing's top heavy.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.479
If it drops...

14:57.564 --> 14:58.772
All right.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.440
Okay. So, uh,

15:00.525 --> 15:02.818
we're gonna
pull this hub apart
piece by piece.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.278
Got it.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.619
Hey, Chief,
this is Dawson.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.621
Uh, I found a,
uh, a blood trail,

15:14.706 --> 15:15.914
and I think a victim
may have wandered off.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.625
I'm going to go check it out.
Okay. Well, you
watch yourself.

15:18.835 --> 15:19.835
Report back.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.545
You need assistance,
don't you hesitate.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.879
Yes, Chief.
Copy that.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.593
61. Repeat your location.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.344
I have personnel
available.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.933
We're good to go, Chief.
Cancel that assistance.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.101
Copy that.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.396
Well, sometimes it pays
to have an ex-squad guy
as your PIC.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.357
Aw, dude. Ugh.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.110
Looks like he pulled
it out himself.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.030
Oh. Well, an A
for effort, sir.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.448
But we're gonna
have to...

15:49.532 --> 15:50.741
Just...

15:51.367 --> 15:53.619
Just leave me
the hell alone.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.412
As soon as we
patch you up.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.180
Hey. Brett.
Yeah. Sorry. Sorry.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.978
The heck? Come on!

16:21.147 --> 16:22.147
What's wrong?

16:22.231 --> 16:24.316
I don't know, it's stuck.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.651
All right, hang on.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.152
I'm losing it.
Hang on.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.404
All right. All right.
We got to go quick.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.407
I'm almost there.
I'm almost there.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.700
What's happening?

16:33.910 --> 16:36.870
Nothing. I'm just hoping
to get home in time to
toss out my wife's cooking.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.082
I... I told you not
to make me laugh.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.208
Got it!

16:44.921 --> 16:47.297
Come on.
Come on, you're good.
You're okay.

16:47.382 --> 16:48.965
Gotcha.

16:49.759 --> 16:50.884
Home free.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.636
Otis, grab this.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.391
All right.
What'd I tell you?

16:57.475 --> 16:58.517
All right?

16:58.601 --> 17:00.352
Okay, okay.
You're gonna
make me laugh.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.937
You're good,
you're good.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.484
Hey.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.904
What the hell is that?

17:12.281 --> 17:14.282
The line's anchored, Capp.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.203
It's not gonna be enough.
We need some more
webbing to hold her down.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.039
Hey! Whatever it takes,
just make it fast!

17:21.457 --> 17:22.541
I don't know
what happened.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.043
It feels like maybe we
hit a bird or something?

17:25.128 --> 17:26.378
It just happened so fast.

17:26.504 --> 17:28.547
Hey, don't even
think about it.
You're in good hands.

17:28.631 --> 17:29.881
I'm on a total
hot streak.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.175
Just won a thousand bucks
in Vegas two weeks ago.

17:32.677 --> 17:33.969
Blackjack or dice?

17:34.303 --> 17:35.679
Rolling the bones, baby.

17:53.656 --> 17:54.990
We got it, Lieutenant!

17:55.074 --> 17:57.534
See? What'd I say?
Total hot streak.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.550
Squad 3, report.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.554
- Hey, we're all good, Chief.
- Still working on it.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.558
All right.

18:21.642 --> 18:24.436
Almost there.
Safe and sound,
like I told you.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.688
Am I going to
be all right?
Yeah.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.316
Right as rain,
no time. Guaranteed.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.570
Chief,

18:34.030 --> 18:36.156
this was stuck
in the rotor.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.908
It's a
remote-controlled drone.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.869
There's lot of kids
flying them around
these days.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.513
Hello?

19:01.057 --> 19:02.516
Fire Department,
open up.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.767
I'm here to help.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.019
I... I can't. Please...

19:06.103 --> 19:09.147
All right, back up.
Shield your eyes.
I'm going to open the door.

19:15.988 --> 19:16.988
Hello?

19:19.116 --> 19:21.743
Hey. Hey. Hey,
can you hear me?

19:23.579 --> 19:25.413
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.332
I screwed up.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.762
Come on. I'm going
to help you out.
Let's go. I got you.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.600
There we go.
Okay. Hey.

19:46.769 --> 19:47.853
What's your name?

19:47.937 --> 19:49.771
Allen.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.565
Allen. Okay.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.024
All right, Allen.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.360
Listen, I know you've
probably got one
hell of a headache,

19:55.444 --> 19:57.112
but I'm not going to
play 20 questions.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.739
Just need you to do me
a favor. Take this and
hold it really tight

19:59.824 --> 20:01.575
against your head,
like this, okay?

20:01.659 --> 20:03.034
Right there.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.162
Chief, this is Dawson.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.498
I'm behind the building
west of the impact site.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.334
I've got a juvenile victim
with an open fracture
head wound.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.295
Ambulance 61, do you copy?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.505
Uh, yeah, Chief.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.716
We're short
on paramedics.
Can you split up?

20:17.800 --> 20:19.009
Go. I got this guy.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.302
Okay.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.262
Here.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.723
Hey, Chief,
I'm on my way.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.016
Copy that.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.101
It's just you and me,
whoever you are.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.732
Sir, sir, relax.

20:33.816 --> 20:34.816
Relax!

20:35.151 --> 20:37.360
What did you do to me?
What did you do?

20:37.445 --> 20:38.987
I'm trying to help you!

20:39.071 --> 20:41.573
You have a serious,
serious injury here.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.949
There was a crash.

20:43.034 --> 20:45.118
Stop it. Just stop.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.370
Look, I...
I'm not a cop.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.748
I'm a paramedic.
Look at my uniform.

20:51.292 --> 20:52.542
I... I got to
get out of here.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.711
No, you've got to
go to the hospital.
No!

20:54.921 --> 20:56.755
No hospitals.
Listen!

20:57.256 --> 20:59.549
Whatever illegal crap
you're doing in this van,

20:59.634 --> 21:00.842
that is your business.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.427
Mine is keeping
you alive.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.137
I have lost
too many lives today.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.513
I am not about
to lose you.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.390
Sit back and
let me do my job!

21:31.666 --> 21:33.667
Well, come on, then.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.752
Do your thing.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.676
Okay.

21:43.636 --> 21:44.761
Hey.
Hey.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.096
Hey, what do we got?

21:46.180 --> 21:48.682
Intracranial fracture,
shallow respirations.

21:49.392 --> 21:51.059
Uh, help me out
with the C-collar.

21:51.268 --> 21:52.894
I'll secure his
airway and intubate.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.604
No, no, no, no.
Let's not intubate.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.481
It could increase
intracranial pressure.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.650
Let's make sure
that he doesn't have
a brain injury first.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.734
Okay.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.277
It's my fault.

22:01.696 --> 22:05.365
Hey, honey, I promise you
this is not your fault.

22:06.701 --> 22:10.370
My dad said not to
fly it without him.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.957
Now Jack is
going to die.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.626
Wait, what?

22:19.797 --> 22:20.922
Who's Jack?

22:21.048 --> 22:23.049
The boy and his brother
were on a roof next door,

22:23.134 --> 22:24.926
flying their dad's
remote-controlled drone.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.637
Uh, they got clipped by the
chopper when it came down.

22:27.722 --> 22:29.764
The brother got knocked off.
He's still down somewhere.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.266
Okay. Say no more.

22:31.642 --> 22:32.809
81, do you copy?

22:33.019 --> 22:35.520
Heard the whole
thing, Chief.
We're on our way.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.604
Let's go.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.815
Fire department,
call out!

22:39.942 --> 22:41.443
Over here, Lieutenant!

22:43.112 --> 22:44.279
He's alive.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.197
Can you hear me?

22:53.330 --> 22:55.623
Hey, uh, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, be careful.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.880
Cruz, I need the power killed
on this transformer now.

23:01.964 --> 23:02.964
Right.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.841
Somebody bring
me some tools.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.718
Copy that, Lieutenant.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.016
All right, bud,
we're almost there.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.772
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

23:18.856 --> 23:19.856
Yeah.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.150
What about us?

23:22.276 --> 23:23.651
I... I can't move.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.820
Robert, my husband,
he's stuck.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.573
All right,
just hang on.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.699
We're going
to get you out.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.659
He's breathing.
Hold on, honey.

23:31.744 --> 23:32.869
All right, listen,
I just...

23:32.953 --> 23:34.162
Don't move, okay?

23:34.246 --> 23:35.455
I'm having
trouble breathing.

23:35.581 --> 23:36.748
Yeah, I know. Just...

23:36.832 --> 23:38.625
I need you to be still.
Can you do that for me?

23:38.834 --> 23:39.959
Okay, good.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.338
Chief, this is
Lieutenant Casey.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.506
I found the victim.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.008
He's fallen into
a transformer cage,
bleeding heavily.

23:47.218 --> 23:49.552
Transformer took some
serious damage when he hit,

23:49.637 --> 23:51.638
and I've got live wires
I'm trying to keep clear of.

23:51.722 --> 23:54.015
Copy, 81. Proceed
with extreme caution.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.060
Will do. Just waiting
on Cruz to kill the power
to this transformer.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.228
Copy.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.146
Hey, what's your name?

24:00.439 --> 24:01.981
Jack. Jack.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.066
Jack?

24:03.150 --> 24:04.359
Come on, buddy.
I need your help.

24:04.777 --> 24:05.777
It's gonna hurt.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.780
We're gonna have to get you
away from this transformer.

24:10.199 --> 24:12.826
No luck, Casey.
We're going to need to
come in to shut the power off.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.577
Not enough time.
He's bleeding out.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.958
Lieutenant, if that blood
reaches the live wire...
I know.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.709
You two get clear, now.

24:38.352 --> 24:39.519
Squad 3, come in.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.689
Check your lines.
Secure that chopper.

24:43.065 --> 24:44.691
You're
running out of time!

24:44.900 --> 24:46.109
Lieutenant?

24:46.360 --> 24:47.694
Not yet, Chief.
I'm almost there.

24:57.580 --> 25:00.415
Severide,
that ledge is crumbling!
You're losing support.

25:00.791 --> 25:01.833
Herrmann! Otis!

25:01.917 --> 25:04.210
I need this entire area
clear, right now!

25:04.295 --> 25:05.670
Move them to the
end of the rope!

25:05.754 --> 25:06.921
All right, everybody.

25:13.596 --> 25:14.971
All right,
let's get him out.

25:19.894 --> 25:21.603
Careful, Tony.
It's all right.
I got him.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.275
Hey, Chief! I got
one victim free,
one to go.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.325
Are you going to
tell my pops?

25:35.534 --> 25:37.952
Trust me, Jack, he's
only going to care
that you're alive.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.787
Hold still.
Almost done.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.790
All right. Come on,
let's go, go, go.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.460
Damn it!

26:00.017 --> 26:01.267
Casey, report!

26:04.104 --> 26:05.688
Lieutenant, it's going to go!

26:14.949 --> 26:17.158
Quick!
Grab that line, now!

26:26.669 --> 26:27.794
Lieutenant,
don't move in there.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.587
We need to
secure this line!

26:30.756 --> 26:32.423
Okay! We got you!

26:32.675 --> 26:34.342
Get out!
Now!
I'm coming out!

26:42.851 --> 26:45.144
Casey, report.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.690
Jack, can you hear me?

26:49.441 --> 26:50.441
Are you okay?

26:50.693 --> 26:51.818
That was gnarly.

26:52.194 --> 26:53.486
Casey, report.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.697
Yeah, we're okay.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.532
On our way to triage.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.708
Chief.
Casey's all right.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.710
He and the boy are
on their way back.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.045
Allen? Allen?
Is that my boy?

27:11.213 --> 27:13.673
Hey, sir. Sir,
he's gonna be okay.
All right?

27:13.799 --> 27:15.842
The trauma team
at Chicago Medical
is top-notch.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.552
Jack, is he...

27:17.720 --> 27:18.886
We got him. He's alive.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.517
If you want,
you can ride with us.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.394
Thanks, both of you.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.315
Hey. Good work.

27:34.611 --> 27:35.737
Dawson and Mills.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.071
Just like old times, huh?

27:37.406 --> 27:39.741
Yeah, just like old times.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.163
Just about done.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.665
Well, there are no more
stretchers or backboards.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.375
You think you can
walk with me to triage?

27:50.836 --> 27:51.836
No.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.254
Okay, fine.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.424
Well, I've controlled
the bleeding for now,
but you need stitches.

27:56.717 --> 27:57.925
We're done here.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.305
Not until I get you
to the hospital.

28:03.599 --> 28:05.183
Are you going to
get out of my way,

28:05.267 --> 28:06.684
or do I have to
go through you?

28:10.814 --> 28:13.107
Please, Robert,
hang in there. I...

28:13.192 --> 28:14.192
He hates flying.

28:14.276 --> 28:15.818
I begged him to go
for our anniversary.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.528
Hey, don't beat
yourself up, all right?

28:17.613 --> 28:19.614
It wasn't your fault.
Just stick with him.

28:19.990 --> 28:22.450
I'm so sorry. Robert,
I'm so sorry.

28:24.620 --> 28:26.162
He... He just
squeezed my hand!

28:27.081 --> 28:28.206
Sally...

28:30.959 --> 28:32.168
I want a refund.

28:33.921 --> 28:34.921
Oh, Robert.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.884
Hey, Severide.
Your wife find you?

28:40.677 --> 28:41.677
What?

28:41.804 --> 28:44.514
Yeah, she's here,
bugging out,
looking all over for you.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.740
Hey, we got to book
it to Chicago Med.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.367
We got a kid here with
severe head trauma.

29:05.285 --> 29:06.494
Where's the driver?

29:07.121 --> 29:08.746
He refused treatment.

29:09.957 --> 29:10.998
Don't ask.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.633
Yeah, Doc. Thanks
for returning my call.

29:21.552 --> 29:22.844
Yeah.

29:23.178 --> 29:24.303
Of course.

29:24.388 --> 29:26.931
My shift finishes at 8:00,
I can be there by 8:30.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.142
Yeah, of course.

29:29.226 --> 29:31.477
Why, is there an
update regarding the test?

29:36.483 --> 29:38.317
I'm going to
check the storage for
another box of gauze.

29:38.402 --> 29:40.445
I think we went
through everything
we had in the ambo.

29:40.529 --> 29:41.571
Dawson.

29:42.698 --> 29:43.698
What?

29:44.783 --> 29:46.701
That's who you had
the romance with.

29:50.164 --> 29:52.165
Um, yeah,
you're perceptive.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.584
I've been called worse.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.587
Look this is
going to require a
longer conversation,

29:57.671 --> 29:58.713
including beers.

29:59.381 --> 30:00.590
Whenever you want.

30:01.550 --> 30:02.592
Mm-hmm.

30:05.012 --> 30:06.471
All I'm saying is,

30:06.555 --> 30:07.930
considering the
day we've had,

30:08.015 --> 30:10.308
I wouldn't object to
an early dinner.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.226
Oh, yeah, Mouch?
You volunteering
to cook?

30:13.395 --> 30:15.062
Hey, hey.
Hold up a sec.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.150
So, that's two big
saves in one day.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.860
Sounds like a cause
for celebration.

30:20.944 --> 30:23.988
I was thinking maybe we get
a hotel room tomorrow night,

30:24.072 --> 30:25.615
get out of the apartment.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.911
You didn't tell
Severide to leave.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.330
I...

30:35.667 --> 30:36.667
No.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.170
I didn't.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.553
Hotel room better
have champagne.

31:05.405 --> 31:06.447
You all right?

31:07.866 --> 31:08.866
Mmm.

31:18.627 --> 31:19.961
Okay, so,

31:20.837 --> 31:23.381
I don't do this
for just anybody.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.758
But, um...

31:25.842 --> 31:27.885
I think that you're
a budding superstar.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.181
Got a free class card
I want to give you.

31:32.266 --> 31:33.474
Aw.
Save you $60.

31:33.559 --> 31:34.559
Thank you.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.062
Hey, Zumba!

31:48.991 --> 31:51.993
Hey. I know it's, uh,
none of my business.

31:52.077 --> 31:55.413
And frankly, I'm not
in a position to judge,
but, uh...

31:55.664 --> 31:59.083
No. No, no. Cruz...
Cruz and I are not a thing.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.127
I just feel obligated
to say that

32:01.211 --> 32:04.213
the whole firehouse
romance thing, uh, it's...

32:05.465 --> 32:06.882
It's not easy,
all right?

32:07.009 --> 32:08.342
You have to
work at it.
Wait, no.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.678
It's not...
It's not what you think.

32:13.307 --> 32:14.348
Yeah.

32:15.976 --> 32:16.976
All right.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.646
But this goes
no further.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.524
Promise me this
won't go any further.

32:25.736 --> 32:27.778
Okay, so this
goes no further.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.489
All right, but this
goes no further.

32:31.617 --> 32:32.950
Hey, guys,
guess what?

32:40.042 --> 32:41.125
Hey, Brett.

32:46.506 --> 32:47.673
See you soon?

32:52.304 --> 32:53.304
Yeah.

33:02.731 --> 33:06.817
All I'm wondering is if
there's some sort of
special equipment

33:06.902 --> 33:09.487
involved
in this whole plan.

33:09.571 --> 33:11.155
Seriously, Mouch,
you're over thinking it.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.325
Just bring yourself
and the rest will take
care of itself, all right?

33:14.409 --> 33:17.370
And in terms of any
out-of-pocket expense...

33:19.748 --> 33:20.873
All right, listen.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.333
I'll catch up
with you later.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.919
Okay, sure.
But Trudy always says,

33:25.003 --> 33:26.671
"Be prepared for
the worst case scena..."

33:26.755 --> 33:28.172
Okay, he's gone.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.801
It's a personal
matter, Norm.

33:31.885 --> 33:32.885
No, you can't.

33:36.390 --> 33:37.390
Chief.

33:37.933 --> 33:39.308
Now is not a good
time, Herrmann.
I know.

33:39.393 --> 33:41.310
Just give me
two seconds, tops.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.187
I want you to
know something.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.271
Quickly.

33:44.606 --> 33:45.815
The woman we saved?

33:46.525 --> 33:47.983
She was minding
her own business,

33:48.068 --> 33:49.652
and then the hand of God

33:49.736 --> 33:52.113
dropped a helicopter
rotor on her.

33:53.115 --> 33:54.615
What's your point,
Herrmann?

33:56.952 --> 34:00.246
When she was in the
thick of it, she thought
for sure she was a goner.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.707
I followed up
with Chicago Med.

34:04.251 --> 34:05.626
The lady's out of the red.

34:07.629 --> 34:09.338
Guess what I'm
trying to say is,

34:10.465 --> 34:12.466
dark skies don't
always mean rain.

34:18.432 --> 34:19.724
Give Donna our love.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.226
Oh, my God.
Come on. Come on.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.030
I just wanna talk.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.576
My boyfriend's gonna
be here any second.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.662
Oh, yeah? This is,
like, your guy's spot?

36:09.668 --> 36:11.168
It's a thank you.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.295
I was a real
jerk yesterday.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.548
I might have been
a little rude.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.174
You were just
doing your job.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.802
You might just have
saved my life.
I appreciate that.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.389
If you ever get in
any problems,
any kind at all,

36:23.473 --> 36:24.682
you call me.

36:24.766 --> 36:25.933
Leave a message.

36:26.768 --> 36:27.768
I'll find you.

36:28.228 --> 36:29.311
Simple as that.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.439
Take care now.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.080
Hey.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.792
Well, considering
the day you
had yesterday,

36:51.877 --> 36:53.252
I figured you'd still
be at the firehouse.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.087
Paperwork can wait.
This can't.

36:55.171 --> 36:56.297
Have you been
waiting long?

36:56.923 --> 36:58.340
You know you don't have
to come to all these.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.885
I will come to
the ones that I can.

37:02.137 --> 37:03.304
How are you feeling?

37:05.807 --> 37:06.807
Scared.

37:07.809 --> 37:09.268
Terrified, if I'm
telling the truth.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.478
I feel fine for a while,
but then, you know,

37:11.563 --> 37:13.564
the commercial comes on
with a smiling baby...

37:13.648 --> 37:14.982
Hey. Hey, hey.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.862
You're going to be okay.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.448
Our baby is going
to be okay.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.036
Now, don't ask me how
I know. I just know.

37:30.498 --> 37:31.624
I got you.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.210
I got you.

37:37.172 --> 37:38.172
Boy.

37:42.928 --> 37:43.928
It's a boy.

37:45.221 --> 37:47.681
I asked the doctor.
I knew you wanted to know.

37:57.651 --> 37:58.776
Come here.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.119
Look, babe.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.956
You can't be showing
up at accident sites.
Who does that?

38:12.040 --> 38:13.916
Someone who is concerned
about their loved one.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.876
Did you see one other
firefighter's wife there?

38:15.961 --> 38:16.961
So what?

38:17.045 --> 38:19.797
Kelly, all you had to do
was respond to one text!
I wouldn't have come!

38:19.881 --> 38:22.049
Britt, I can't be
messing with my phone

38:22.133 --> 38:23.384
when I'm on my way
to a damn rescue!

38:23.468 --> 38:24.843
And I can't be
expected to sit at home,

38:24.928 --> 38:26.220
waiting for a phone call,

38:26.304 --> 38:27.554
telling me that you're
not coming home!

38:27.639 --> 38:29.223
What are you talking about?

38:29.307 --> 38:30.474
This is insanity!

38:30.642 --> 38:32.935
Insanity is
doing the same thing
over and over.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.813
And that's the definition
of insanity.

38:35.897 --> 38:37.314
So, this is what
the end sounds like.

38:37.607 --> 38:38.607
You see?

38:39.025 --> 38:42.277
Sometimes, when you just
wait out your problems,
they go away.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.154
Now I don't have
to tell them...

38:47.283 --> 38:49.118
No. No!

38:49.202 --> 38:50.202
Oh, yes.

38:54.582 --> 38:55.666
Let's get out of here.

38:55.750 --> 38:56.750
Yeah.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.588
Damn, Cruz. You got
a full house out there.

39:01.965 --> 39:02.965
Really?

39:04.509 --> 39:05.509
Okay.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.553
It's time to bring it up
a notch, Joe.

39:07.637 --> 39:08.887
You bring them
the magic.

39:09.639 --> 39:10.764
You bring them
the magic.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.599
All right, everybody!

39:12.684 --> 39:14.560
How we feeling tonight?

39:15.770 --> 39:18.647
Can I hear you say,
Zum... Oh.

39:19.399 --> 39:20.482
Yeah!

39:25.030 --> 39:26.196
That is not good.

39:26.281 --> 39:27.948
Uh...

39:31.119 --> 39:32.161
Et tu, Brute?

39:32.287 --> 39:33.662
Come on! What's
the hold up here?

39:33.747 --> 39:35.831
We paid a lot for this Zima,
not the yappity-yapp.

39:35.915 --> 39:37.291
Come on!
It's Zumba.

39:37.459 --> 39:38.917
All right.
He knows what I mean.

39:39.002 --> 39:40.002
You know what,
forget it.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.587
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.

39:44.924 --> 39:46.467
For real?
Come on,
we're here.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.052
We're ready to go.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.803
We're ready.

39:50.513 --> 39:53.057
Okay. But I take
this very seriously.

39:53.641 --> 39:54.767
By all means.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.604
All right, kids!

39:58.688 --> 40:00.481
Let me see what
you're made of!

40:00.774 --> 40:03.525
Ho! Hey! Oh!

40:04.486 --> 40:05.903
We're going this way!

40:08.656 --> 40:09.740
Whoo!

40:12.243 --> 40:13.243
Here we go!

40:16.498 --> 40:18.415
Whoo! Shake it!

40:20.335 --> 40:21.335
Here we go!

40:21.461 --> 40:23.170
Ha! Ho! Ha!

40:23.671 --> 40:25.506
Company! Slide it out!

40:25.673 --> 40:27.382
Give it up! That's right!

40:27.592 --> 40:29.510
Live it up!
One more time!

40:32.055 --> 40:34.181
Mmm. I hate fighting.

40:36.643 --> 40:37.851
I don't know.

40:38.895 --> 40:40.354
The aftermath
has its perks.

40:42.649 --> 40:43.982
Some of this looks fresh.

40:44.067 --> 40:45.067
Mmm, it is.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.862
I keep adding a little bit
more to it every month
since the accident.

40:50.532 --> 40:51.532
Why?

40:53.076 --> 40:54.952
'Cause I want to
remind myself.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.204
Losing my sister,

40:59.707 --> 41:01.792
experiencing the pain
of that loss...

41:05.213 --> 41:06.839
It's a part of who I am.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.634
I'm sorry I showed
up at the crash.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.428
Just the thought
of losing you too was...

41:15.348 --> 41:18.225
No one understands what
it's like but you, Kelly.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.484
Hey.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.030
I'm not going anywhere.
