00:55.764 --> 00:59.560
<i>Way up in the Arctic,
there's a small town called Taigasville.</i>

01:00.435 --> 01:02.312
<i>A remote berg lost in time,</i>

01:02.813 --> 01:04.647
<i>where everyone knows everyone.</i>

01:12.698 --> 01:13.865
<i>That's me.</i>

01:14.032 --> 01:15.242
<i>Right there.</i>

01:15.325 --> 01:16.201
<i>You see?</i>

01:17.035 --> 01:18.412
<i>Swifty's the name.</i>

01:18.495 --> 01:19.871
<i>I'm an Arctic fox.</i>

01:20.581 --> 01:23.333
<i>And my kind evolved
to blend into the environment.</i>

01:23.875 --> 01:25.043
<i>Oh, you see?</i>

01:25.127 --> 01:26.128
<i>There we go again.</i>

01:27.462 --> 01:30.549
<i>So why dressed in all white, you ask?</i>

01:30.632 --> 01:33.510
<i>Well, let's just say
my parents were a little old-fashioned.</i>

01:34.011 --> 01:35.971
<i>To them, being invisible meant being safe.</i>

01:36.972 --> 01:39.224
<i>Out of sight, you're all right.</i>

01:39.308 --> 01:41.101
<i>That's the Arctic fox mantra.</i>

01:41.184 --> 01:42.769
<i>But, for me, being invisible...</i>

01:42.853 --> 01:44.146
Hello, Mr. Musk Ox.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.439
<i>...well, just meant being...</i>

01:48.483 --> 01:49.359
<i>...invisible.</i>

01:50.652 --> 01:53.530
<i>And that's the last thing
any kid wants to be.</i>

01:55.032 --> 01:59.494
<i>All I wanted was to be seen,
to be noticed like...</i>

02:00.662 --> 02:01.872
<i>...these guys.</i>

02:02.039 --> 02:03.749
<i>The Top Dogs.</i>

02:03.832 --> 02:06.209
<i>Duke, Dakota, and Dusty.</i>

02:06.293 --> 02:07.794
<i>Taigasville's biggest celebrities,</i>

02:07.878 --> 02:10.631
<i>and easily the most visible citizens
in town.</i>

02:14.551 --> 02:16.887
<i>Being noticed was never a problem
for them.</i>

02:47.626 --> 02:48.460
Sorry.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.421
I'll fix it.

02:52.631 --> 02:53.674
Hold on a second.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.390
Uh... there you go.

03:03.934 --> 03:04.768
Hmm?

03:04.935 --> 03:05.769
Thanks.

03:10.107 --> 03:13.360
<i>The Top Dog delivery
was cause for celebration.</i>

03:13.443 --> 03:15.654
<i>They were our connection
to the outside world,</i>

03:15.737 --> 03:17.823
<i>through the packages and letters
that they brought us.</i>

03:18.949 --> 03:23.745
<i>And for a town as isolated as Taigasville,
trust me, that really meant something.</i>

03:38.844 --> 03:39.678
Hm.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.691
Hey there, citizens.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.401
Arctic strong.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.652
Yeah!

04:05.328 --> 04:06.663
Arctic strong!

04:07.122 --> 04:07.956
Wow.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.333
Hey, this is so cool.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.377
Thanks. Awesome.

04:12.461 --> 04:13.336
Wow.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.588
Thank you.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.423
Arctic strong!

04:20.343 --> 04:22.137
Excuse me.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.139
Oh, hey there, little girl.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.474
What can I do for you?

04:25.974 --> 04:27.726
Is there anything for him?

04:27.809 --> 04:28.643
Hm.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.979
Oh, I almost didn't see you there,
little fella.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.689
Let's see.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.484
Nope, afraid not.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.279
Here, what's your name?

04:39.905 --> 04:40.906
Swifty.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.449
Swippy?

04:42.532 --> 04:43.450
Swifty.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.910
Ah.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.953
There you go, Shifty.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.705
Whoa.

04:52.334 --> 04:56.630
Now, remember kids,
when put to the test, deliver your best.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.632
Arctic strong!

04:58.715 --> 05:00.050
Arctic strong!

05:01.718 --> 05:03.386
<i>Now that's recognition.</i>

05:35.752 --> 05:36.962
<i>Ah, youth.</i>

05:37.754 --> 05:39.381
<i>Warm memories of being cold.</i>

05:41.049 --> 05:42.759
<i>Once Jade left for school,</i>

05:42.843 --> 05:45.971
<i>I turned my focus towards working
at the place of my dreams.</i>

05:48.723 --> 05:49.766
<i>Yep, that's me.</i>

05:50.642 --> 05:51.560
<i>Years later.</i>

05:52.227 --> 05:54.855
<i>Talk about bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
Literally.</i>

05:55.397 --> 05:58.567
<i>I was finally hired on
as an ABDS junior employee.</i>

06:08.869 --> 06:09.786
Uh-uh.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.455
Not so fast. Fox go there.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.090
Oop.

06:29.973 --> 06:30.807
Hey, there.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.893
Welcome to the jungle.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.853
Well, all right, thanks.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.527
<i>I was on my way.</i>

06:42.611 --> 06:44.487
<i>The dream of being a Top Dog,</i>

06:44.571 --> 06:47.616
<i>of being recognized
and standing out from the pack,</i>

06:47.699 --> 06:50.535
<i>was so close that I could taste it!</i>

06:52.537 --> 06:55.457
<i>Yeah, okay, well...
maybe it wasn't that close.</i>

07:02.213 --> 07:04.341
Oh, what is this?

07:05.216 --> 07:07.010
Employee of the year?

07:09.137 --> 07:11.681
And a lingonberry pie in my honor.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.560
You shouldn't have.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.896
<i>FM The Blast.</i>

07:17.979 --> 07:20.565
<i>Good morning,
Taigasvillians.</i>

07:20.649 --> 07:23.568
<i>You're listening to Nasty Naz Narwhal.</i>

07:23.652 --> 07:25.820
<i>Today's gonna be a balmy one,</i>

07:25.904 --> 07:27.781
<i>with a record-breaking high...</i>

07:27.864 --> 07:29.616
<i>...of 34 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

07:29.699 --> 07:31.034
<i>So pack up those parkas</i>

07:31.117 --> 07:33.536
- <i>and break out the wind breakers.</i>
- Nailed it!

07:34.204 --> 07:37.499
<i>Scientists from around the globe
have been scratching their heads</i>

07:37.582 --> 07:41.378
<i>trying to figure out why the sudden spike
in global temperatures,</i>

07:41.461 --> 07:43.463
<i>which have managed to level off...</i>

07:43.546 --> 07:45.340
<i>...in recent years,
but now, all of a sudden,</i>

07:45.423 --> 07:48.009
<i>pow, it's hot, hot heat out there,</i>

07:48.093 --> 07:49.886
<i>and no one knows why.</i>

07:49.970 --> 07:51.304
<i>That's the bad news.</i>

07:51.388 --> 07:53.682
<i>So how about some good news, folks?</i>

07:53.765 --> 07:57.894
<i>It's Duke's 25th anniversary
with the ABDS.</i>

07:57.978 --> 07:59.312
<i>Yes, siree.</i>

07:59.396 --> 08:00.230
<i>A big shout-out...</i>

08:00.313 --> 08:02.691
<i>...to our favorite mail-carrying canine.</i>

08:02.774 --> 08:04.818
<i>This one goes out to you, big guy.</i>

08:05.902 --> 08:09.072
So, who's gonna be a good boy?
Who's gonna be Top Dog?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.073
Oh, that's you.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.534
And look at me.
Oh, no, it's you. Top dog.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.869
You are... Top Dog!

08:15.787 --> 08:18.665
Come on, come on...

08:19.666 --> 08:20.500
Yes!

08:23.753 --> 08:24.587
No!

08:26.381 --> 08:27.465
PB, open up.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.844
PB!

08:31.219 --> 08:32.053
Wait, what the...

08:34.097 --> 08:35.265
What is that?

08:41.730 --> 08:44.315
Swifty, what are you doing here so early?

08:44.399 --> 08:46.484
I lost my pound.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.444
What pound?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.487
The pound I gained
to hit the 20-pound minimum

08:49.571 --> 08:50.655
to pull the Top Dog sled.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.743
- Well, you can't fight your metabolism.
- I can and I will.

08:54.826 --> 08:58.246
Put to the test,
I'm going to deliver my best. Come on!

08:58.329 --> 09:00.999
Swifty, how have I
put this repeatedly in the past?

09:01.082 --> 09:02.042
- Look out!
- Oh, yes.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.335
Deliveries have only ever been made

09:04.419 --> 09:05.920
by dogs, and you are not a dog.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.839
- What?
- You are a small Arctic fox

09:07.922 --> 09:11.468
who was not meant to pull a giant sled
with even gianter packages on it.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.054
- Are you hearing me?
- What? Yeah, every word.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.055
Come on, buddy.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.848
We've got a found to find. Let's go.

09:16.931 --> 09:17.766
Whoo!

09:19.267 --> 09:20.727
Maybe you should just be happy

09:20.810 --> 09:22.020
with what you have.

09:23.688 --> 09:24.606
Swifty.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.983
I mean, you could break your legs

09:27.067 --> 09:28.234
pulling one of those sleds.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.489
Or catch hypothermia.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.659
Or fall into a crevasse
and have to eat your own feet.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.912
At least I'll be remembered
for something.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.999
The only thing I'll be remembered
for now is not being memorable,

09:43.083 --> 09:44.626
like that other guy.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.044
What guy?

09:46.127 --> 09:47.504
Exactly.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.593
Oh, the work bell.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.971
Oh, no, we're going to be late.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.516
It's going to take forever
to walk from up here.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.267
Who said anything about walking?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.186
Okay, give me a second.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.354
Here we go.

10:07.816 --> 10:08.858
I'm bathing.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.695
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy like a fox!

10:12.779 --> 10:15.573
Take a risk
once in a while. It's good for you.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.367
This is not a good idea!

10:18.743 --> 10:21.371
- Hang on, buddy! I'll get us there.
- Slow down!

10:21.454 --> 10:22.997
We can't slow down in the air.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.999
I think I'm gonna lose a pound.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.632
Come on, PB.
Enjoy the ride!

10:32.757 --> 10:34.384
Too fast.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.468
Watch out!

10:45.019 --> 10:48.481
- We're gonna die!
- We're gonna die!

10:52.443 --> 10:54.445
Whoo!

10:57.615 --> 11:00.326
So you think Jade would ever go out
with a fox like me?

11:00.410 --> 11:02.620
Really? Now you're talking about this?

11:02.704 --> 11:05.081
She's been back for a year now
and you haven't done anything.

11:05.540 --> 11:09.669
A year? Well you know,
these things are all about timing!

11:16.843 --> 11:18.303
Whoo!

11:21.514 --> 11:22.640
Sorry!

11:28.229 --> 11:29.355
Watch out!

11:33.651 --> 11:34.903
Look out!

11:36.154 --> 11:36.988
Ah!

11:44.579 --> 11:47.540
- Swifty, what are you doing?
- Hey there, Jade. Hi, how's it going?

11:47.624 --> 11:48.917
Sorry!

11:52.128 --> 11:53.338
Argh!

11:57.967 --> 12:01.387
See? Like I said, we made it.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.225
Ew.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.393
Yeah, better not let Magda see that.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.270
Magda see everything.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.606
PB on line.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.734
Swifty, my office, now.

12:17.862 --> 12:18.696
Hm.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.907
What are you looking at?

12:25.662 --> 12:26.663
Adequate?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.289
Extremely.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.875
Extremely... adequate.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.462
Up from last year's
competently sufficient,

12:34.545 --> 12:38.967
but down from the year before's
satisfactorily appropriate.

12:39.050 --> 12:42.303
Still, no promotion for you this year.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.306
Now, get back to work.

12:45.390 --> 12:46.516
Magda, I...

12:46.641 --> 12:47.976
I've worked really hard for this.

12:48.059 --> 12:51.020
- I mean this... It's not fair!
- Life is not fair.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.231
Is it fair that I have to run business

12:53.314 --> 12:57.568
with antique equipment and employees
who are only extremely adequate?

12:57.652 --> 13:03.074
Is it fair that ex-husband run off
with wild elk ten years younger? No!

13:03.157 --> 13:05.285
I'm sure I had nothing to do with that.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.623
Was that an earthquake?

13:14.919 --> 13:16.838
Don't try to change subject.

13:17.714 --> 13:21.759
I know you have big dream
of being Top Dog, but you're not dog.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.261
You're just fox.

13:23.344 --> 13:27.557
Did you have to say "just a fox"?
Couldn't you just say "a fox"?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.350
I mean the "just" thing
is really kind of...

13:29.434 --> 13:31.311
Look, what if I just had
a small delivery route?

13:31.394 --> 13:32.645
- Just a little one?
- <i>Nyet.</i>

13:32.729 --> 13:34.897
I run serious business here.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.032
Ow.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.283
Quiet.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.076
I didn't say anything.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.161
I'm okay!

13:51.331 --> 13:52.540
So how did it go?

13:53.124 --> 13:54.417
It was promising.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.835
Very... Very promising.

13:58.796 --> 13:59.881
All right, team,

14:00.631 --> 14:02.759
let's get ready for the daily slog.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.011
Arctic strong.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.638
- Yeah, yeah... Arctic strong.
- Arctic strong.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.272
Game faces, guys.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.025
Okay.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.569
Three, two, one.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.321
Showtime.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.323
Yeah!

14:28.910 --> 14:30.828
- Arctic strong!
- Whoo-hoo!

14:31.204 --> 14:33.247
I swear that's gonna be me one day.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.083
Not on my watch.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.709
Back to work!

14:49.263 --> 14:50.223
That's one.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.395
That's two.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.065
That's three.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.881
I don't know how much longer
I can take this, PB.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.885
You just need to learn
how to go to your happy place.

15:27.969 --> 15:31.931
Take a look at Lemmy over there.
He's in his happy place all the time.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.148
Here, I'll help you get started.

15:41.399 --> 15:44.026
Plus, you never know
what's around the corner.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.945
Jade is around the corner.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.029
Yeah, right.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.114
Wait, what?

15:51.159 --> 15:53.578
No, she can't see me like this.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.745
What do I do?

15:54.829 --> 15:56.497
You just be yourself.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.125
Lemmy, what have you got for me?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.463
Oh, boy.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.174
Hey, PB. Lemmy.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.509
Where is Swifty?

16:10.887 --> 16:12.138
Oh, hey, Jade.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.639
Give me a second, would you?

16:13.723 --> 16:15.683
I'm sorry, Nasty Naz Narwhal,

16:15.766 --> 16:19.187
I don't have time for a radio interview
for tomorrow morning's show.

16:19.270 --> 16:22.231
I know. I realize that all my fans
want to hear from me,

16:22.315 --> 16:25.109
but they're just going to have to take
a number and get in line, right?

16:25.193 --> 16:29.280
'Cause when Swifty says he doesn't
have time, he doesn't have... time.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.325
So famous you don't need
to plug your phone in?

16:33.242 --> 16:34.577
Okay, I gotta go.

16:35.119 --> 16:35.953
'Sup, Jade?

16:36.037 --> 16:38.414
Hey, is that my coffee maker?

16:38.498 --> 16:39.415
Oh, yeah.

16:39.916 --> 16:40.958
Whoa.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.920
I re-tempered the glass on the carafe,
added a hydraulic press,

16:44.003 --> 16:46.005
and juiced up the tiered percolation unit.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.048
Thanks.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.383
Does it still make coffee?

16:49.467 --> 16:52.011
Yes, PB. It still makes coffee.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.723
Now, please tell me I didn't miss
the delivery cut-off time.

16:55.806 --> 16:56.974
Sorry, Jade.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.227
The delivery run done already begun.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.144
Ah!

17:00.520 --> 17:02.480
I have to get
this package out this morning,

17:02.563 --> 17:07.193
and I would have been here earlier,
but someone dumped a pile of snow on me.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.278
Snowbody's perfect.

17:09.569 --> 17:10.404
Hm.

17:12.323 --> 17:15.117
Lemmy, can you fly up
and see how far Duke is?

17:15.201 --> 17:16.202
Fly?

17:16.285 --> 17:17.537
Oh, no. Uh-uh.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.079
Lemmy don't play that.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.873
Lemmy doesn't do flying.

17:20.957 --> 17:24.627
Wait, but you're an albatross.
I thought albatrosses were great fliers.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.964
Okay, first, it's albatrosseses.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.258
Second, don't go labeling me.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.884
It's my job.

17:32.093 --> 17:32.927
Oh.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.346
I can deliver that for you.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.515
What, are you a Top Dog now?

17:37.598 --> 17:39.141
I... Well, I'm in training.

17:39.225 --> 17:43.145
Working my way up, but by this time
next year, I'm taking over Duke's spot.

17:43.271 --> 17:44.897
I mean, you're looking
at the next lead dog

17:44.981 --> 17:46.857
for the Arctic Blast Delivery Service.

17:46.941 --> 17:47.900
Right, PB?

17:48.484 --> 17:49.485
Tell her.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.070
Um...

17:53.906 --> 17:56.367
Well, nothing's official yet.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.244
See?

17:58.786 --> 17:59.620
He knows.

18:00.871 --> 18:01.914
Oh, ah!

18:01.998 --> 18:03.749
Oh, no, it's gonna blow!

18:06.711 --> 18:08.212
Lived it!

18:08.713 --> 18:10.673
That darn sorting machine.

18:10.756 --> 18:11.841
I'll take care of it.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.677
Just please remember
to handle that delivery with care.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.264
You got it, Jade. It's my job.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.183
Your package is safe with me.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.312
Lemmy, show me
where Magda keeps those old sleds.

18:32.737 --> 18:33.821
Whoa, mama.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.865
Tell me I can do this.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.658
There is no way you can do this.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.535
Reverse psychology, nice.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.584
This doesn't look good.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.794
What are you talking about?
This is beautiful.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.881
Yeah, I never seen
rust and mold shine like that.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.508
If Magda finds out you took this,

18:54.592 --> 18:56.636
she might actually destroy you.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.179
Just cover for me, okay?

18:58.262 --> 18:59.805
I'll be back before Magda
even knows it.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.350
Eh?

19:08.314 --> 19:09.482
Yes!

19:12.234 --> 19:14.070
I got the package, I got a sled.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.946
I'm ready to go! Wah!

19:16.030 --> 19:17.573
What else do I need?

19:17.657 --> 19:18.949
Besides a tetanus shot?

19:19.617 --> 19:20.785
You'll need this.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.037
- Right, for autographs. Good thinking.
- No.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.455
Customer signatures.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.248
And that, too. I knew that.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.250
Are you sure about this, Swifty?

19:28.918 --> 19:30.878
What's the worst that could happen, right?

19:36.884 --> 19:39.428
My first delivery
to the middle of nowhere.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.598
- Thanks, Jade.
- Thank you.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.809
Couldn't have been
three blocks away, no.

20:41.991 --> 20:42.867
Whoo.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.912
<i>Yes, who is it?</i>

20:46.996 --> 20:49.957
Hello,
Arctic Blast Delivery Service.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.544
I have a package for... Mr. Occu Pant.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.505
<i>Just leave the package by the mailbox.</i>

20:56.589 --> 20:58.924
Yeah, sorry, I need a signature.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.552
<i>I've never had to sign before.</i>

21:01.635 --> 21:02.803
It's official procedure.

21:03.637 --> 21:04.805
<i>Since when?</i>

21:05.264 --> 21:07.391
Since procedures became official, sir.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.227
- <i>What?</i>
- Oh, you know... I can wait.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.188
I can wait a long time.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.106
I can wait
until the cows come home.

21:14.190 --> 21:17.818
I can wait until the pigs, donkeys,
the frogs and the turtles,

21:17.902 --> 21:20.905
and the, you know...
Wait, do turtles even come home?

21:20.988 --> 21:23.199
I mean, technically,
they're kind of home already, right?

21:23.282 --> 21:24.158
Home's on their back.

21:24.241 --> 21:28.037
<i>Stop, please. Stop, for goodness' sake.</i>

21:37.963 --> 21:38.964
Whoa.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.808
Oh, I'm a puffin
and I will sign for the package.

21:48.891 --> 21:49.725
Thank you.

21:51.852 --> 21:52.728
Okay.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.605
Here... Here you go, ma'am.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.317
Or sir.
Or either way is fine.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.902
Just give it here.

21:59.985 --> 22:00.820
Here.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.030
Oh, okay,
I got it.

22:03.113 --> 22:05.157
Oh, wait. Oh!

22:14.124 --> 22:18.796
Right then,
Mr. Official Procedure. Where do I sign?

22:20.047 --> 22:22.007
Right there, Mr. Occu Pant.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.649
Hey, I love puffins.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.901
Wow, look at those little guys go.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.444
What are they doing?

22:42.528 --> 22:44.905
Aren't you a fuzzy little nosy parker?

22:44.989 --> 22:49.827
Isn't there a delightful maxim
about how curiosity killed the cat?

22:49.910 --> 22:52.538
Well, it's a good thing
I'm a Top Dog then, isn't it?

22:52.621 --> 22:55.040
You? You're just a fox.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.793
There's that "just" again.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.212
Look, no time to talk, sir.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.756
I've got to head back to headquarters
to continue my duties.

23:02.840 --> 23:03.924
Top Dog!

23:04.341 --> 23:05.759
Thank you very much.

23:07.928 --> 23:11.432
Those Top Dogs are becoming a nuisance.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.560
Something will have to be done about them.

23:47.968 --> 23:48.844
Mm.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.311
Jade!

23:58.270 --> 23:59.146
Jade.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.774
Jade!

24:03.108 --> 24:07.279
Jade!

24:08.572 --> 24:09.406
Oh.

24:09.573 --> 24:10.449
Hey, Swifty.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.034
Hey. Hi.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.828
I made sure your package got delivered.

24:14.912 --> 24:18.165
No mistakes, no delays,
custom holdups, nothing.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.334
Sure was far out there though,
wasn't it?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.003
I mean, really, really far out there.

24:23.087 --> 24:24.922
I must say I'm impressed.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.549
That's about as efficient a delivery
as you'll find anywhere.

24:28.342 --> 24:31.595
Well, I guess you would know, right?
Miss Worldly Traveler.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.305
You've been just about everywhere.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.474
Well, not everywhere.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.768
Well, almost everywhere though, right?

24:38.310 --> 24:40.562
What's it like out there
in this big, wide world?

24:41.230 --> 24:43.732
Big and wide.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.818
And hot. Too hot.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.111
I missed the Arctic air.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.612
Is that why you came back?

24:49.363 --> 24:53.617
That, and this is my home.
I mean, it was funny.

24:53.701 --> 24:56.495
There I was, going to
all these amazing engineering schools

24:56.578 --> 24:58.914
in all these exotic countries,

24:58.998 --> 25:02.918
and as the months turned into years,
for some reason I...

25:03.002 --> 25:04.628
I just kept thinking about home.

25:05.713 --> 25:06.839
And then it hit me.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.007
My heart was here...

25:08.632 --> 25:09.633
in Taigasville.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.219
Must have been exciting though.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.515
Whoa.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.893
That's Spanish for,
"Yes, it was very exciting."

25:19.977 --> 25:21.020
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

25:22.229 --> 25:23.147
That's French.

25:23.647 --> 25:24.690
I know, that's...

25:24.773 --> 25:26.567
I'm just saying it,
you know, I...

25:26.650 --> 25:29.028
I'm fluent in... in all the fluencies too.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.323
So what do you...
What do you got here?

25:33.407 --> 25:36.035
I'm just putting the final touches
on the town snowblower,

25:36.118 --> 25:38.662
and I've upgraded it
to a three-stage power system

25:38.746 --> 25:42.499
with hydro-static transmission
and a gross torque of 56 pounds per foot.

25:42.583 --> 25:45.461
Right, wow.
Fifty-six pounds of feet.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.004
Whoo! That's a lot of feet.

25:48.464 --> 25:52.509
Yeah, now have you considered adding,
like, flame decals on the side?

25:52.593 --> 25:55.012
You know, wouldn't that be... hot?

25:55.804 --> 25:57.014
I'll think about it.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.392
All right, well, look, I should just
get going before I keep talking.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.144
Oh.

26:02.436 --> 26:03.937
Okay. Sure.

26:08.901 --> 26:09.985
Hey, Swifty.

26:10.694 --> 26:11.737
Yeah.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.656
Thanks for delivering
that package for me.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.158
Sure, sure.

26:16.784 --> 26:17.701
Anytime, Jade.

26:20.871 --> 26:23.373
So Jade, I was thinking,
do you wanna go out sometime?

26:23.457 --> 26:27.377
We could... Come on, Swifty. Come on!

26:27.544 --> 26:29.713
Hey, Jade.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.591
Hey, Ja...

26:59.034 --> 27:00.202
Looking good, Swifty.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.084
Ah! Oh...

27:09.670 --> 27:10.712
Oh...

27:10.879 --> 27:13.173
- No, no, no, no, no...
- Whoa!

27:13.757 --> 27:16.093
I am freaking out, man!

27:16.260 --> 27:19.096
PB!

27:19.513 --> 27:20.848
What took you so long?

27:20.931 --> 27:24.017
Oh, you should have seen me!
That was amazing.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.936
I was, like, swooshing and whooshing.

27:26.019 --> 27:28.438
I was all like, "Sign here.
Here's your package, sir."

27:28.522 --> 27:31.525
They were like, "Thank you," and I was
like, "You're welcome, Mr. Occu Pant."

27:31.608 --> 27:33.944
And there were these little puffins.
Oh, there are so many...

27:34.027 --> 27:35.779
Swifty. Where have you been?

27:36.196 --> 27:37.781
I was... out.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.825
Out delivering packages?

27:39.908 --> 27:41.493
No, no, not exactly.

27:41.577 --> 27:44.872
No, it was a...
single package.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.167
Aha. You lie.

27:48.250 --> 27:50.460
Wait, I was just answering
accurately, right?

27:50.544 --> 27:51.962
I mean accuracy...

27:52.045 --> 27:54.214
is important, isn't it?
All right, who sold me out?

27:55.048 --> 27:56.383
Oh.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.260
I didn't know it was a secret.

27:58.343 --> 28:02.181
You said you got promoted to a Top Dog
and, let's see, what else?

28:02.848 --> 28:03.682
Shh, shh!

28:03.765 --> 28:04.683
Oh!

28:05.100 --> 28:07.686
You said something
about replacing Duke...

28:09.313 --> 28:12.107
This Lemmy, you know, he's...

28:12.691 --> 28:17.487
That's it. Fox break rules and tell lies
to everybody about promotion.

28:17.571 --> 28:20.949
Fox never get promotion
so long as Magda here.

28:21.033 --> 28:21.867
Never.

28:21.950 --> 28:26.330
Fox suspended from official ABDS work
until further notice.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.625
Suspended? Really?

28:42.638 --> 28:43.722
Hm.

28:47.184 --> 28:48.393
What are you looking at?

28:52.731 --> 28:54.066
Yeah, I feel you, bro.

29:03.700 --> 29:04.785
I don't know about you guys,

29:04.868 --> 29:09.122
but I'm looking forward to 40 winks
of good old-fashioned shut eye.

29:09.206 --> 29:11.792
Yeah, my dogs are barking all right.

29:12.125 --> 29:15.837
Can you believe Swifty today?
Getting caught stealing that old sled.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.548
If that fella had an inkling
of what this job actually entails...

29:19.841 --> 29:22.844
Let the little guy have his dream.
He's not hurting anyone.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.264
Well, what have we got here?

29:27.015 --> 29:28.016
Hello, little guy.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.601
Are you lost?

29:29.685 --> 29:31.061
You want us to call your...

29:33.272 --> 29:34.523
mama.

29:40.821 --> 29:43.323
<i>Ninety-nine FM The Blast.</i>

29:43.407 --> 29:45.033
<i>Good morning, Taigasvillians.</i>

29:45.117 --> 29:47.619
<i>You're listening to Nasty Naz Narwhal.</i>

29:47.703 --> 29:49.830
<i>Temperatures continue
to rise at freakish speeds</i>

29:49.913 --> 29:50.956
<i>causing world leaders</i>

29:51.039 --> 29:52.457
<i>to scramble for a plan.</i>

29:52.541 --> 29:55.043
<i>Well, Naz got a plan for you.
Slap on the bathing suit</i>

29:55.127 --> 29:57.045
<i>and grab that piña colada.</i>

29:57.129 --> 30:00.299
<i>It's pool party time!</i>

30:11.685 --> 30:12.769
Huh?

30:20.193 --> 30:21.069
Hm.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.363
No return address.

30:24.573 --> 30:25.532
Okay.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.285
What kind of delivery is this?

30:28.368 --> 30:30.329
- Special.
- Hey, whoa.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.915
Let me out! Hey, let me out!

30:37.753 --> 30:38.754
What's going on?

30:38.837 --> 30:41.548
Quiet, we ask the questions here.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.342
Explain this.

30:44.051 --> 30:45.135
It's a feather.

30:45.218 --> 30:48.347
A feather from perhaps a puffin!

30:48.430 --> 30:50.682
Probably from the puffins
that work for that walrus.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.434
- You got some sunglasses?
- Walrus?

30:52.517 --> 30:54.311
Take note.
This is new intelligence.

30:54.394 --> 30:58.482
It appears the shadowy conspirators
are finally coming to light.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.192
- Shadowy conspirators?
- <i>Oui.</i>

31:00.275 --> 31:02.736
Something very bad
is going on in the Arctic.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.238
Ever since the puffins turned up,
so has the heat.

31:05.322 --> 31:08.158
Look, I just met them when I delivered
a package to their place up north.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.117
Okay?

31:09.201 --> 31:10.952
He knows where they live!

31:12.204 --> 31:15.499
Do you think he's telling the truth
or could he be one of them?

31:15.582 --> 31:17.417
Why would he tell us
about their whereabouts

31:17.501 --> 31:19.336
if he was one of them? Hm?

31:19.419 --> 31:20.629
This is true.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.547
- It is official.
- Ah!

31:22.631 --> 31:26.802
He must become one of us.
Commence the initiation ceremony.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.099
Ah!

31:32.849 --> 31:33.892
What'd you do that for?

31:33.975 --> 31:36.103
That was the initiation ceremony.

31:36.186 --> 31:38.397
Well, that's a terrible
initiation ceremony.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.524
Okay, fox, welcome to the team.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.568
You are now part of <i>la Résistance.</i>

31:43.652 --> 31:46.988
I am Bertha
and this is my life partner, Leopold.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.616
And together we uncover conspiracies.

31:49.699 --> 31:52.702
- An honor to meet you, Mr...
- Swifty.

31:52.786 --> 31:53.995
- Swifty!
- What?

31:54.079 --> 31:55.122
You're about to be assigned

31:55.205 --> 31:56.623
your first mission.

31:56.706 --> 31:57.958
Do you see?

31:58.458 --> 31:59.918
Hm.

32:00.585 --> 32:03.046
Well, that is weird.
I wonder what's going on?

32:03.130 --> 32:04.548
Don't we all?

32:04.631 --> 32:07.467
Find out what kind of happening
is happening down there.

32:07.551 --> 32:10.303
Okay. Well, I'll start
the recon mission right away.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.305
The truth...

32:12.639 --> 32:14.766
she's out there.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.351
And you must bring her to us.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.854
Okie dokie, guys.
Well, it's been real.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.523
<i>Vive la Résistance.</i> Fight the power.

32:21.606 --> 32:25.318
- We shall not be assimilated.
- Exterminate, exterminate.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.698
- He is a strange fellow.
- <i>Oui.</i>

33:03.190 --> 33:06.234
Hey, we didn't get
our hospital supplies today.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.652
What's happening?

33:07.736 --> 33:09.237
No deliveries today.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.780
No deliveries?

33:12.115 --> 33:14.242
Who's gonna tell Doc Grizzly?

33:19.623 --> 33:21.333
Swifty, what are you doing here?

33:21.416 --> 33:23.543
- What's going on?
- It's the Top Dogs.

33:23.627 --> 33:24.628
They quit.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.922
- What do you mean they quit?
- He means like Splitsville.

33:27.005 --> 33:30.842
Gonestown. Vamooselvania. Look.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.095
"Sorry, moose lady. We quit."

33:35.931 --> 33:38.934
No Top Dogs, no deliveries.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.270
No deliveries, no ABDS.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.855
What will Magda do?

33:45.941 --> 33:48.818
And Magda not moose. Magda caribou.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.280
You're not thinking...

33:53.990 --> 33:55.450
You are thinking.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.996
I hate when he's thinking.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.085
Magda, I've been waiting
my entire life for this moment

34:05.168 --> 34:06.920
and you're not going
to turn me down again.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.380
Now, I'm going out there.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.800
I'm taking a sled, delivering packages
whether you like it or not.

34:11.882 --> 34:16.221
Why? Because when put to the test,
we deliver our best!

34:20.641 --> 34:21.685
I stepped in your ink pad

34:21.768 --> 34:24.437
and made little footprints
all over your desk, didn't I?

34:26.106 --> 34:28.608
Well, it doesn't change the fact
that I'm going out there today,

34:28.692 --> 34:29.568
you understand?

34:31.485 --> 34:32.571
All right.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.072
Just get filthy paws off desk.

34:35.864 --> 34:38.076
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

34:38.159 --> 34:41.496
Magda, you have made
the smartest decision of my life!

34:41.580 --> 34:43.498
- Swifty!
- Yes?

34:45.958 --> 34:48.712
Magda bend rules one time.

34:48.795 --> 34:53.425
If fox screw up, miss one delivery,
damage one package,

34:53.507 --> 34:57.596
or even lose single pen
that belongs to office, that's it.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.472
You're done here forever.

34:59.556 --> 35:02.183
Don't you worry, Magda.
You won't regret this.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.727
Your pen's safe with me.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.113
Pen's safe.

35:16.156 --> 35:18.366
Magda regret this already.

35:20.910 --> 35:21.953
All right, everybody.

35:22.037 --> 35:24.164
Top Dog here, ready for action.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.582
What? Really?

35:25.665 --> 35:27.375
Yeah, really, PB. Really.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.336
Now, what'd I tell you guys?
Okay, everyone here?

35:29.419 --> 35:30.503
Listen up.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.547
Now, let's go get those doors open.
It's showtime.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.383
I got my game face on. How's it look?

35:37.135 --> 35:38.345
Floyd.

35:38.428 --> 35:39.429
Uh?

35:40.055 --> 35:41.598
Door, please. Top Dog here.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.308
Game face.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.234
I'm ready. You ready? Let's do this.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.569
Hook me up, PB.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.154
Let me come with you, to help pull.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.114
Come on, no way. Not gonna happen.

35:58.198 --> 36:01.993
If you feel faint or a cramp coming on,
don't hesitate to just leave the sled...-

36:02.077 --> 36:03.995
I stretched. Don't worry about it.

36:04.079 --> 36:04.996
Would Duke do that?

36:05.080 --> 36:06.289
No, I think not,

36:06.373 --> 36:12.045
'cause you're about to see the magic show
in three and a two and a one and shoot..

36:15.048 --> 36:17.217
Yah!

36:17.717 --> 36:19.594
Abracadabra.

36:20.595 --> 36:21.805
Ooh, oh... Oh.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.014
Swifty.

36:23.098 --> 36:27.102
Ninety-eight, 99, 100.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.730
Ah! Yeah, okay, that's the third set.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.857
Did Magda change her mind
about the suspension?

36:32.941 --> 36:35.443
Let's just say she picked
the right canine for the job.

36:35.527 --> 36:40.407
I gotta tell you, sure feels nice
being recognized more than just a fox.

36:40.490 --> 36:41.991
I'm just a fox.

36:42.409 --> 36:45.245
Yeah, but, no, no, you're a fox.

36:45.495 --> 36:47.247
Well, no, that sounds weird too.
You're great.

36:47.330 --> 36:50.375
Everyone loves how you do
the gadgets and trinkets and...

36:50.458 --> 36:51.543
the stuff.

36:52.335 --> 36:53.545
Gadgets and trinkets?

36:56.881 --> 36:59.092
You have anything
that needed delivering?

36:59.843 --> 37:01.136
Is this for real?

37:01.219 --> 37:02.345
You're not pretending?

37:02.429 --> 37:05.557
That's so... No, not pretending.
Not at all.

37:05.682 --> 37:07.559
Hundred percent,
super-duper Top Dog here.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.686
I know it must be hard to stay calm
in my presence.

37:09.769 --> 37:11.187
Don't worry, I'm getting used to it.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.233
Here you go.

37:15.316 --> 37:18.069
This one is even more important
than the last one.

37:18.153 --> 37:21.531
Jade, all of your packages
are important to me.

37:23.616 --> 37:24.784
Can I ask you something?

37:24.868 --> 37:26.411
Yes, of course.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.539
Would you like to...

37:29.622 --> 37:32.292
get a four percent discount
on your next delivery?

37:32.375 --> 37:33.334
Oh.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.044
Sure.

37:36.796 --> 37:40.091
Just gotta get going here.
Then it's smooth sailing.

37:40.175 --> 37:42.510
I think I'm going uphill. Are we uphill?

37:46.765 --> 37:48.600
Ooh, oh! Whoa!

37:52.103 --> 37:54.063
I hope he makes it back okay.

37:54.147 --> 37:56.733
I hope he doesn't hurt himself
pulling that sled.

37:56.816 --> 38:00.779
I hope someone figures out
why all the beavers have Italian accents.

38:16.836 --> 38:17.712
Whoo!

38:20.882 --> 38:21.716
Ow!

38:41.694 --> 38:43.279
Here you go.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.907
Uh?

38:47.325 --> 38:48.743
Ah...

38:55.333 --> 38:57.669
Yah!

38:59.212 --> 39:01.673
Yeah.

39:02.006 --> 39:05.760
Whoo.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.638
Whoo.

39:08.721 --> 39:13.643
Why don't they make smaller sleds?

39:21.484 --> 39:22.986
Kidnapping the Top Dogs

39:23.069 --> 39:25.029
was not an order.

39:25.113 --> 39:31.202
How dare you carry out such an operation
without my permission!

39:31.911 --> 39:34.581
Now that the Top Dogs
have seen our operation,

39:34.664 --> 39:36.833
we can't let them go, can we?

39:36.916 --> 39:38.960
They know too much.

39:39.043 --> 39:43.548
So, who will deliver Jade's packages
to me now, you bird brains?

39:50.722 --> 39:54.934
Ah! There's my favorite delivery pup.

39:55.018 --> 39:57.562
Yes, sir. Got another package for you.

39:57.645 --> 40:01.357
Your timing couldn't be better.

40:01.441 --> 40:04.235
Whatever you say. Just sign here
and you're good to go.

40:08.197 --> 40:10.158
Wow, how many puffins
have you got in there?

40:10.241 --> 40:16.205
Oh, I'm not about to discuss the specifics
of my nefarious plans with you.

40:16.289 --> 40:18.374
Wait, what? Nefarious... plans?

40:19.208 --> 40:20.418
Oh, did I say nefarious?

40:20.501 --> 40:21.794
I meant hilarious.

40:21.878 --> 40:25.590
Oh, we're starting
an all-puffin aquatic cabaret.

40:40.063 --> 40:43.608
You should see our collection
of swimming caps.

40:44.484 --> 40:45.610
Swimming caps.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.612
I thought you weren't discussing
any specifics.

40:48.029 --> 40:48.905
Uh...

40:49.030 --> 40:50.156
Look over there.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.287
Hey, wait, no. You still have my pen.

40:56.746 --> 40:57.830
No, I don't.

40:57.914 --> 40:59.374
Now, go away.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.417
Yes?

41:02.168 --> 41:03.002
Uh...

41:03.378 --> 41:04.462
I'm sorry.

41:04.545 --> 41:07.131
It looks like you got another package
out here on the sled.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.592
Oh, all right. Please wait.

41:10.551 --> 41:13.054
Go retrieve the package.

41:39.622 --> 41:40.456
Whoa.

41:41.124 --> 41:43.751
That's a little aggressive
for a cabaret show.

42:08.776 --> 42:11.279
Jade, what have you gotten yourself into?

42:18.703 --> 42:20.079
Aha.

42:23.082 --> 42:25.960
<i>Meeting time, puffins. Let's go.</i>

42:26.044 --> 42:28.963
<i>Gallop and carry your wits. Hurry up.</i>

42:37.764 --> 42:38.765
Huh?

42:40.349 --> 42:41.934
What the...

42:42.018 --> 42:46.230
Once we finish the preliminary
core sampling and pre-boring

42:46.314 --> 42:48.441
on the outskirts of town...

42:48.524 --> 42:52.737
...we shall sweep in from the north,
a united cold front.

42:52.820 --> 42:55.406
A high-pressured systematic attack

42:55.490 --> 43:00.369
will rain down on those unsuspecting fools

43:00.453 --> 43:04.082
as our thunderous machine twists
into the heart of town.

43:04.165 --> 43:05.374
- Yes!
- Any questions?

43:21.182 --> 43:24.685
Oh, for goodness... Good-bye.

43:32.652 --> 43:33.486
PB!

43:35.863 --> 43:39.242
The delivery! Middle of nowhere! Puffins!
Swim caps! Since wo...

43:39.325 --> 43:42.537
Heya, Swifty.
Congrats on your first delivery run.

43:42.620 --> 43:43.663
Way to go, bud.

43:43.746 --> 43:46.124
Yeah, listen. There is something
going on out there...

43:46.207 --> 43:47.291
Hold that thought.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.001
There's something I wanna show you.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.631
Surprise!

43:54.382 --> 43:57.969
- What the...
- The Top Dog returns. Oh, yeah.

43:58.052 --> 44:00.471
- Guys! You have to listen...
- That's my boy.

44:00.555 --> 44:01.556
Yahoo!

44:01.681 --> 44:04.350
- Yeah!
- Jade, I need talk to you.

44:04.433 --> 44:05.268
Whoo-hoo!

44:05.351 --> 44:06.561
Oh.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.437
Okay. All right.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.823
- You the man!
- Way to go, dog.

44:19.699 --> 44:20.700
All right!

44:22.076 --> 44:23.911
Swifty.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.038
Yeah...

44:26.914 --> 44:29.000
There's my number one star.

44:29.083 --> 44:30.918
Look, I just need to tell you... W... Wait.

44:31.544 --> 44:33.379
- Number one star?
- Of course.

44:33.462 --> 44:37.758
Quite honestly, Magda thought fox
would throw packages in ocean, so...

44:37.842 --> 44:39.218
good job.

44:39.302 --> 44:40.887
Oh, thanks.

44:40.970 --> 44:42.471
You even brought back pen.

44:42.555 --> 44:43.389
Keep.

44:44.056 --> 44:45.266
You've earned it.

44:45.349 --> 44:47.476
Okay, back to party.

45:05.661 --> 45:08.080
- Hey! Hey!
- Congratulations, Swifty.

45:08.164 --> 45:10.249
Hey, all right, you hear what she said?

45:10.333 --> 45:14.212
Number one star, y'all. That's me.
I got a pen.

45:14.295 --> 45:16.631
- Swifty?
- Yeah. Yeah...

45:16.714 --> 45:18.090
You wanted to talk to me.

45:18.174 --> 45:20.843
Oh, yeah, but I gotta give the fans
what they want.

45:20.927 --> 45:22.470
Hang on, just one second.

45:22.553 --> 45:25.806
Yo, everybody.
Who let the dogs out?

45:26.807 --> 45:30.019
Let me hear you say hey.

45:30.144 --> 45:32.730
Come on!

45:33.314 --> 45:35.399
Rock on! Yeah.

45:37.318 --> 45:41.572
Yah!

45:42.782 --> 45:43.616
Aw...

45:51.207 --> 45:54.168
Hold on. Look, just a minute.
I'll be right back.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.840
- Jade! Wait. Wait a second.
- Oh, is it my turn now?

45:59.924 --> 46:03.010
I gotta tell you what I was trying to tell
you earlier. Those packages that you...

46:03.094 --> 46:04.720
That's what you wanted
to talk to me about?

46:04.804 --> 46:07.098
No! Well, yeah.
Look, something's going on...

46:07.181 --> 46:09.433
You know, Swifty,
ever since I got back,

46:09.517 --> 46:12.853
it just seems like you've been trying
to act like someone else.

46:12.937 --> 46:14.563
What's wrong with being yourself?

46:14.647 --> 46:15.940
Come on, Jade. It's...

46:16.732 --> 46:17.692
I'm Top Dog.

46:18.317 --> 46:21.112
- My dream has come true.
- What's wrong with that, right?

46:21.195 --> 46:22.905
Yeah, I get it, Swifty.

46:23.739 --> 46:25.783
I'm glad you finally got what you wanted.

46:27.493 --> 46:28.411
Jade.

46:28.494 --> 46:29.996
Come on, Jade...

46:30.538 --> 46:32.081
Come on back, hero.

46:32.164 --> 46:35.334
We've got some celebrating to do.
You saved the day.

46:35.418 --> 46:37.378
You're flying high, bro.

46:37.461 --> 46:39.964
This is your night! Enjoy it.

46:40.047 --> 46:40.923
Party time.

46:41.007 --> 46:42.675
Oh, yeah!

46:42.758 --> 46:43.884
Whoo!

46:44.885 --> 46:46.345
Ah!

47:10.619 --> 47:11.704
Is someone there?

47:34.435 --> 47:35.311
Oh.

47:35.519 --> 47:36.937
How did you get in here?

47:45.446 --> 47:47.281
<i>Ninety-nine FM, The Blast.</i>

47:47.365 --> 47:49.283
<i>Hey, hey, Taigasvillians.</i>

47:49.367 --> 47:51.118
<i>We got another cooker outside today</i>

47:51.202 --> 47:52.912
<i>at 41 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

47:52.995 --> 47:54.914
<i>Gotta say, I am loving this thaw.</i>

47:54.997 --> 47:57.958
<i>Best thaw I ever thaw!</i>

47:58.042 --> 47:59.418
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Oh.

47:59.502 --> 48:00.628
<i>And a big shout out</i>

48:00.711 --> 48:02.671
<i>to Taigasville's newest Top Dog,
Swifty.</i>

48:03.255 --> 48:06.092
<i>We finally have a replacement
for that old chestnut Duke.</i>

48:06.175 --> 48:08.511
- <i>Maybe things will actually get delivered</i>
- Oh...

48:08.594 --> 48:10.346
- <i>on time now.</i>
- Oh...

48:12.348 --> 48:14.350
Has anybody seen my self-respect?

48:28.030 --> 48:29.240
There's the guy.

48:29.323 --> 48:31.075
Come on, buddy. It's showtime.

48:31.158 --> 48:32.743
Don't you yearn for the burn?

48:32.827 --> 48:35.871
I'm getting ready to blast my abs
and max my glutes!

48:35.955 --> 48:36.997
Yeesh.

48:38.124 --> 48:40.084
No offense, but you look awful.

48:40.876 --> 48:43.629
Are you keeping hydrated?
What's your electrolyte count?

48:43.712 --> 48:46.090
Wait, PB, come on.
Just time out for one second.

48:46.173 --> 48:48.968
Be stronger than your excuses, Swifty.
Let's go!

48:49.885 --> 48:52.138
We're jogging to work today, big guy.
Whoo!

48:55.850 --> 48:57.601
PB, what do you think is causing

48:57.685 --> 48:58.978
all this warm weather suddenly?

48:59.061 --> 49:01.188
Don't know, buddy. But I'm loving it.

49:03.232 --> 49:05.109
Hey, Swifty. Hi, Swifty. You're the best.

49:05.192 --> 49:06.944
- Hey, can you sign this?
- Okay. Yeah, okay.

49:07.027 --> 49:09.113
- Yeah, here you go.
- Thanks.

49:09.196 --> 49:10.114
Awesome.

49:10.197 --> 49:12.032
- Aren't you worried?
- Worried?

49:12.116 --> 49:14.577
I signed up for hot yoga this afternoon.

49:14.660 --> 49:16.662
It's gonna be cooking.

49:16.745 --> 49:18.372
Yeah!

49:18.747 --> 49:20.374
What about the earthquakes?

49:21.208 --> 49:23.711
You know, I saw something
while I was delivering Jade's package.

49:23.794 --> 49:25.588
Focus, Swifty! Fountain rounds.

49:25.671 --> 49:28.591
PB, there's this huge hidden lair
out in the middle of nowhere.

49:28.674 --> 49:30.676
- I love you, Swifty.
- Hey, Swifty.

49:30.759 --> 49:33.220
- Over here, Swifty.
- Can I get an autograph?

49:33.304 --> 49:36.974
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

49:37.057 --> 49:38.225
Here you go.

49:38.309 --> 49:40.144
Can I get your picture?

49:40.227 --> 49:41.270
All right, that's enough!

49:42.938 --> 49:44.064
Swifty.

49:44.148 --> 49:45.107
Sorry, kids.

49:48.319 --> 49:49.153
Huh?

49:50.779 --> 49:52.448
Uh? Uh...

49:52.531 --> 49:54.158
Hey, Top Dog. What gives?

49:54.241 --> 49:56.577
Don't call me that. I don't deserve it.

49:56.660 --> 49:58.996
Sure you do, pal. You've worked hard.

49:59.079 --> 50:01.832
No, I only got the chance
because Duke and the others disappeared.

50:01.916 --> 50:04.293
They didn't disappear. They quit.

50:04.376 --> 50:05.419
That's just it.

50:05.503 --> 50:07.588
- I don't think they did.
- What do you mean?

50:08.255 --> 50:09.757
I think something is going on, PB.

50:10.424 --> 50:11.509
I'm all ears.

50:13.260 --> 50:17.848
There is this crazy walrus
with robotic legs and a British accent.

50:17.932 --> 50:20.809
I know, weird, already, right?
Okay, it gets better.

50:20.893 --> 50:23.020
Now, they're holed up in a secret fortress

50:23.103 --> 50:25.231
filled with adorable,
yet evil, little puffins

50:25.314 --> 50:27.525
that are building
a huge machine which I think

50:27.608 --> 50:29.735
may have something to do
with the rising temperatures.

50:29.818 --> 50:35.533
And I saw harnesses in a garbage can
which makes me 90% sure the Top Dogs

50:35.616 --> 50:39.078
have been dog-napped,
and there are sleeping gas blasters.

50:39.161 --> 50:41.455
It's weird, man!
I'm just telling you!

50:43.415 --> 50:46.377
- I sound like I'm crazy, don't I?
- Certifiable.

50:47.378 --> 50:49.338
How about now?
Do I sound crazy now?

50:50.965 --> 50:52.049
You gotta believe me.

50:52.132 --> 50:53.717
Why don't you believe me?

50:53.801 --> 50:57.846
Because for years you've been stretching
the truth to get attention, that's why.

50:57.930 --> 50:59.765
And quite frankly, I've had enough.

50:59.848 --> 51:02.268
You don't have to make up
a bunch of stuff to impress me.

51:02.351 --> 51:03.852
I'm not Jade.

51:03.936 --> 51:05.187
Are you listening to me?

51:05.271 --> 51:09.358
Yes. Oh, wait, no! What?
I forgot about Jade.

51:09.441 --> 51:11.860
They're using her to build the machine.

51:11.944 --> 51:13.988
- Who?
- The walrus.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.948
The one with the robo-legs?

51:16.031 --> 51:17.866
- Yes.
- Okay, that's it.

51:17.950 --> 51:19.410
You need to go see Doc Grizzly.

51:19.493 --> 51:20.619
No!

51:20.703 --> 51:22.580
I don't like him. Come on, PB.

51:22.663 --> 51:24.748
I'm... Look, I'm sorry, okay?

51:24.832 --> 51:27.585
- I just need you...
- You always need me to do something.

51:27.668 --> 51:29.086
Well, I need to get to work.

51:29.169 --> 51:32.506
That's what I need to do,
but you're probably not listening anyway.

51:33.382 --> 51:34.466
You never do.

52:01.827 --> 52:03.996
- Closed due to flooding?
- Hm.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.166
Lemmy, get mopping.

52:07.249 --> 52:09.710
On it like a baby bonnet riding a comet.

52:09.793 --> 52:11.211
Oh, yeah.

52:13.505 --> 52:16.550
Ah! Who put that wall there, man?

52:17.635 --> 52:19.470
Water everywhere.

52:19.553 --> 52:23.182
Jade need to fix machines.
I call, but she no answer phone.

52:23.265 --> 52:24.350
I'll go get her.

52:24.975 --> 52:27.144
So reliable, that fox.

52:27.227 --> 52:30.022
Lemmy, mop is for cleaning,
not for licking!

52:39.531 --> 52:40.532
Hello?

52:40.616 --> 52:41.492
Jade?

52:42.826 --> 52:43.869
Hello?

53:09.728 --> 53:10.771
"Dear Jade,

53:11.522 --> 53:13.357
our machine is almost complete.

53:13.440 --> 53:16.610
As promised, I shall reveal it to you
once the final piece is finished.

53:17.152 --> 53:18.904
In the meantime,
rest assured that your name

53:18.987 --> 53:22.991
will go down in history
alongside the world's greatest engineers.

53:23.826 --> 53:27.496
Without the parts you've built,
none of this would have been possible.

53:27.579 --> 53:28.539
OVW.

53:28.622 --> 53:30.165
World's greatest engineer."

53:33.752 --> 53:34.670
Huh?

53:38.799 --> 53:40.342
Puffins!

53:40.676 --> 53:41.844
I knew it!

53:41.927 --> 53:43.262
Who's going to believe me?

53:43.595 --> 53:44.430
Hm.

53:48.100 --> 53:50.060
Agent Swifty. He's back.

53:50.144 --> 53:51.395
Did you bring intel?

53:51.478 --> 53:54.815
I brought intel, out-tel, up-tel
and down-tel. Let me tell.

53:54.898 --> 53:55.941
Do tell.

53:59.403 --> 54:03.198
So the walrus and his puffins
kidnapped the Top Dogs.

54:03.282 --> 54:06.243
And Jade, who's been building parts
for his machine.

54:06.326 --> 54:07.286
Exactly.

54:07.369 --> 54:08.746
- Agent Swifty.
- Yes.

54:08.829 --> 54:10.956
You are truly one of us now,

54:11.039 --> 54:13.500
and it is time for you to see
behind the curtain.

54:14.376 --> 54:17.087
It's all here, every suspicious happening

54:17.171 --> 54:19.548
in the Arctic
since the puffins first appeared.

54:19.631 --> 54:21.216
We knew something was going on.

54:21.300 --> 54:23.719
We just didn't have
all the pieces of the puzzle.

54:25.304 --> 54:27.014
Wait a minute. What is that?

54:27.848 --> 54:29.391
I've seen that before.

54:36.607 --> 54:40.736
The walrus has the same map in his lair,
only there's a big X over Taigasville.

54:40.819 --> 54:42.362
<i>Sacrebleu!</i>

54:42.446 --> 54:44.364
It shows where the puffins
have drilled so far.

54:44.865 --> 54:45.866
Drilled for what?

54:45.949 --> 54:46.992
The gas!

54:47.075 --> 54:50.120
Biolipadium Aradithic Dipsodium gas.

54:50.204 --> 54:53.332
B-A-D. BAD gas.

54:53.415 --> 54:54.917
Very bad gas.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.502
Unknown to the establishment.

54:56.585 --> 54:58.253
Denied by the establishment.

54:58.337 --> 54:59.421
It is prehistoric.

54:59.505 --> 55:00.589
It is mutant.

55:00.672 --> 55:02.883
It is hot and incredibly stinky.

55:02.966 --> 55:06.136
If allowed into the atmosphere,
it would speed up global warming,

55:06.261 --> 55:08.972
and melt the ice caps within minutes.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.141
So those weren't earthquakes.

55:11.225 --> 55:13.727
It was the puffins
drilling into the underground pockets,

55:13.811 --> 55:15.354
releasing gas into the atmosphere

55:15.437 --> 55:16.647
to heat it up.

55:16.730 --> 55:19.650
There must be a big one
right underneath Taigasville,

55:20.150 --> 55:22.903
and that mega drill they're building
is so they can reach it.

55:22.986 --> 55:24.947
The truth. She's in here.

55:25.531 --> 55:26.615
We've got to do something.

55:27.199 --> 55:30.953
We could go to the puffin camp
beyond the hills, perhaps find new intel.

55:31.453 --> 55:33.956
It's far. What do you say, Agent Swifty?

55:34.790 --> 55:36.542
<i>Vive la Résistance.</i>

55:36.708 --> 55:38.752
Ow!

55:38.836 --> 55:41.380
Hey, come on.
I've already been initiated.

55:41.463 --> 55:43.215
It's also the secret handshake.

55:44.216 --> 55:46.593
I'm really beginning to hate this club.

55:56.812 --> 55:57.855
There it is.

55:57.938 --> 56:00.232
The truth lying naked...

56:00.315 --> 56:01.733
...before your eyes.

56:07.739 --> 56:08.782
Gotcha.

56:11.243 --> 56:13.328
All right, Bjorn, start the drill.

56:14.997 --> 56:16.665
Go ahead.

56:17.791 --> 56:18.625
Go on then.

56:26.842 --> 56:30.012
I'll just be over here,
enjoying the view from behind this...

56:31.179 --> 56:32.306
...snowbank.

56:32.389 --> 56:33.974
Hold onto your whiskers.

56:38.604 --> 56:39.438
Gas.

56:42.024 --> 56:42.858
Ah!

56:42.941 --> 56:47.779
Oh, that smell.
It's like the planet made a poopy.

56:47.863 --> 56:49.489
Uh-oh.

56:55.954 --> 56:57.372
Maybe they didn't notice.

57:07.633 --> 57:08.884
I think they noticed.

57:09.801 --> 57:10.886
Run!

57:24.399 --> 57:25.317
Oh!

57:26.109 --> 57:27.361
Oh...

57:31.865 --> 57:32.741
Ah!

57:52.177 --> 57:53.512
What?

57:56.848 --> 57:59.017
Good morning, Ms. Jade.

57:59.101 --> 58:02.688
I'm really sorry about the present state
of the accommodations.

58:02.771 --> 58:05.774
Certainly not befitting
of the greatest mechanical engineer

58:05.857 --> 58:08.068
north of the 47th parallel.

58:08.151 --> 58:08.986
Who are you?

58:09.444 --> 58:10.404
Who am I?

58:10.654 --> 58:14.408
Eh, perhaps my biographer Anders here
can illuminate you.

58:20.455 --> 58:22.249
Oh, Anders.

58:22.332 --> 58:27.963
Well, anyway, you may know me as OVW,
the world's greatest engineer.

58:28.505 --> 58:31.091
You're the one
I've been doing all the work for?

58:31.174 --> 58:34.928
Indeed, and I'm so very thankful for it.

58:35.012 --> 58:39.891
However, we're on a tight schedule
and seeing as though the mail has become,

58:39.975 --> 58:42.644
how shall I say,
not entirely dependable these days,

58:42.728 --> 58:45.814
I decided to have you work in house.

58:45.897 --> 58:47.649
You kidnapped me.

58:47.733 --> 58:51.153
Well, we prefer the term
surprise relocation, so...

58:51.862 --> 58:53.030
surprise!

58:55.490 --> 58:57.242
Now, as promised,

58:57.325 --> 58:59.995
I will reveal what we've created
once it's complete,

59:00.078 --> 59:04.416
and for that to happen,
I need one final piece of the puzzle.

59:04.499 --> 59:08.545
I need you to make the control panel.

59:08.712 --> 59:12.049
In any case, time is ticking.

59:12.132 --> 59:16.803
Oh, and I'd really like the main button
to be fuchsia.

59:16.887 --> 59:20.057
Can you do that, please,
a fuchsia engage button?

59:22.559 --> 59:24.061
To work, my dear. To work.

59:32.778 --> 59:35.530
Oh, you'll get
your control panel all right.

59:36.114 --> 59:38.366
And a little something extra too.

59:45.499 --> 59:48.877
- We made it.
- Time to expose the conspiracy.

59:50.712 --> 59:51.797
Come on out.

59:52.380 --> 59:54.800
There's something I need to tell you.
Let's wake up!

59:57.385 --> 59:59.304
Everybody wake up.

59:59.387 --> 01:00:01.056
Everybody come out.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:03.558
- Swifty, where have you been?
- Where's Jade?

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.143
It'll all become clear in a minute.

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.604
First I want to introduce you
to some friends of mine.

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:09.481
- <i>La Résistance!</i>
- <i>Bonjour!</i>

01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:11.233
<i>Guten Morgen,</i> everyone.

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.318
- Now listen.
- We're listening.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.278
Ah! Stop doing that.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:16.947
They are drilling all around the Arctic.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.865
- Who?
- The puffins.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.283
What puffins?

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.702
The ones in the pictures I took. Look.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:28.542
They are going to use the BAD gas
to melt the ice and snow.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:31.044
<i>Oui.</i> The BAD gas beneath Taigasville.

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:34.047
Ah, BAD gas. I love it.

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:35.173
What about Jade?

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:36.550
She's with them.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.386
- Who's them?
- Them are the same as they.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.846
BAD gas.

01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:42.222
Who is they?

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.849
They is the walrus.

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:45.809
Wait, what walrus?

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.144
This walrus.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:51.606
I thought Paul was the walrus.

01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:56.736
Magda know Otto von Walrus all too well.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:02.951
Many years ago, before you worked at ABDS,
Walrus was employee.

01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:05.954
<i>Before that, he lived in ocean,</i>

01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:09.374
<i>obsessed with idea
of fame and immortality,</i>

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:12.627
<i>confusing his crazy for genius.</i>

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.841
<i>For years,
Walrus present his cuckoo ideas...</i>

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:20.802
<i>...until they kick him out.</i>

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:26.516
<i>Resentment grew inside Walrus,</i>

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.060
<i>bitterness, all-encompassing...</i>

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:34.107
<i>until one day, Walrus find the ABDS.</i>

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.359
<i>Magda take him in.</i>

01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:41.448
<i>Then ideas start.</i>

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.450
<i>So many ideas.</i>

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:48.955
<i>Walrus present innovations,
modifications, never ending, like mail.</i>

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:50.749
<i>At first they were good.</i>

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:51.875
[gear cranks[

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:54.127
<i>Make processes better.</i>

01:01:54.711 --> 01:02:00.175
<i>Magda promote him,
but then came pneumatic tube system,</i>

01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:03.178
<i>powered by crazy gas.</i>

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:08.141
<i>The system was brilliant, yes, and would
revolutionize global mail delivery,</i>

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:10.894
<i>but gas was also dangerous.</i>

01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:15.815
<i>If you were to lick,
the results would have been catastrophic.</i>

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:18.985
<i>Walrus go postal.</i>

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:26.034
<i>Magda fire him same day.</i>

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:34.834
Look, Magda,
you can't blame yourself for crazy.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:36.586
We just have to find a way to stop him.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.507
Fox know Walrus lair best.

01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:42.384
Fox must lead.

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:44.010
Lead?

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.178
You know, I...

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.013
- You think that I...
- Magda know.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.098
Fox lead.

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:55.021
Taigasvillians,
if we don't stop the walrus,

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:58.275
the Arctic will melt
and Taigasville will fall into the ocean.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:02.445
We have to band together,
kick down the door,

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.781
and open up an ice-cold can
of Arctic justice.

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:08.994
How's that taste, Lemmy?

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:11.329
Now, who's with me?

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:20.922
Magda with you.

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.508
<i>Vive la Résistance!</i>

01:03:23.591 --> 01:03:25.802
Me too, I'm in. Yeah!

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:30.223
<i>Vive la Résistance.</i>
Viva the resis-dance.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:32.600
PB?

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:35.562
This is all pretty unbelievable, Swifty.

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.688
Very much so, I know.

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:43.862
But I'm always there for you, buddy.
You know that.

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:44.904
Count me in.

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:46.072
Thanks, PB.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.824
How are we supposed to get there?

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.163
We're gonna drive
right through the front door.

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:54.622
Then what?

01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:58.376
Inside, right next to the door,
is a wall of sleeping gas blasters.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.503
- Where else would you put 'em, man?
- Exactly.

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:02.172
Everyone grabs a blaster.

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:04.424
We start gassing.
They all go nighty-night.

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.301
Bertha and Leopold
will hack into the mainframe

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:08.511
where we find Jade,
Duke, and the others are being held.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:11.431
We rescue them, round up the bad guys,
bada-bing, bada-boom.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.475
Justice served. How about ya?

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:15.018
<i>Magnifique.</i>

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:17.479
What could possibly go wrong?

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:36.122
Incoming!

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:50.637
Ah!

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.891
- No!
- Oh.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:00.146
Ow!

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:01.940
Whoa!

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:09.989
Oops.

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:17.288
Yeah, well, this wasn't part of the plan,
but everyone's okay. Right?

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:18.248
- <i>Oui.</i>
- Yeah.

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:19.666
- Kind of.
- Barely.

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:22.836
No! Not okay. We're trapped.

01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:29.467
Duke, Dakota, Dusty.

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.594
They got you too, huh?

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:32.679
This is great!

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:36.641
I mean, well it's not great that we're all
stuck in here, but we're all together.

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:39.060
Right? You can help us all escape now.

01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:41.062
Escape.

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:45.191
Look, little fella,
you can't defeat these guys.

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:46.651
- There's no way.
- What?

01:05:46.734 --> 01:05:48.820
What are you guys talking about?

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:50.363
You're Top Dogs.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:53.032
Taigasville needs you. You're heroes.

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:54.367
Heroes?

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:58.371
We're three overworked mutts
who just want to retire somewhere warm.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:05:59.873
With a beach.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:03.084
And those coconut shell drinks
with the little umbrellas in them.

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:08.840
What happened to
"when put to the test, deliver your best"?

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:14.762
You kids, you grow up idolizing us
thinking we're larger than life.

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:17.307
But the truth is...

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:20.727
we just deliver the mail.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.396
No.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.940
Look, the show's over kid.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:27.650
We're done.

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:41.915
Jade.

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:44.125
It's finished.

01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:45.502
Ah!

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.923
I've done what you've asked.
Now let me go.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:53.343
Yes, well, I have
some other ideas about that.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.929
First, as promised,
I'd like to fill you in

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:59.224
on what all your work
has actually been used to build.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:01.434
A drill?

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:02.769
A colossal drill,

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:05.563
to smash through the heart of Taigasville,

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:08.066
burrow eight miles below the surface...

01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:11.611
...and puncture a pocket
of ancient pre-Cambrian...

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:16.824
gas to melt the polar ice caps.

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:18.243
Why?

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:22.121
Ever since I was a pup, I've tried
to make the world a better place

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:25.124
by way of my limitless genius.

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:29.879
But the world's rejected that gift
again and again.

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:34.884
Well, now it's my turn to take back.

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:38.388
The Arctic will fall
and the world along with it!

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:41.766
Then we'll see who comes running
to my doorstep for help.

01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:44.561
We'll see who's rejected then!

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:48.731
If you're such a genius,

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:51.776
why do you need me
to make a control panel for you?

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:09.627
I had such high hopes for you, my dear.

01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:13.006
You were going to have the honor...
of being my apprentice,

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:17.218
but it turns out you're just
like all the rest of them, aren't you?

01:08:17.719 --> 01:08:20.179
Ah, well, you've chosen your fate then.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:25.225
What button was it again? They all look
the same, just like those bloody puffins.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:26.935
Ah, yes, here we are.

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:28.895
Ta-ta.

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:32.108
Ah!

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.029
Jade!

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.741
Swifty. PB. Lemmy.
What are you doing here?

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:41.868
We came to save you and stop the walrus.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:43.995
Totally failed.

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:44.912
Are you all right?

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:48.750
Don't trust her, Swifty.
She works for the walrus, remember?

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:50.460
I didn't know what I was building! I...

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:54.046
Where was she all those years?
Huh? Off planning with the walrus.

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:55.256
Hm.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.674
It's not true.

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.261
You don't believe that, do you?

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:04.223
Why did you keep making the parts
for him all the time, Jade?

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:05.140
I mean...

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:07.143
why didn't you clue in?

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:09.520
Because I didn't know, Swifty.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:12.482
Look, I saw the letters you got from him.

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:13.399
What?

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:15.401
"Rest assured,
your name will go down in history.

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:17.694
Jade, world's greatest engineer."

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.907
He played you, Jade.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.201
He knew what buttons to push
and you let him.

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:25.953
- I'm sorry. If I had known...
- It's okay.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:27.913
I get it.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.457
That's what I wanted after all,
the same thing.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:34.295
And once I got that in my head,
I couldn't see anything else.

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:37.506
It's like I had blinders on.
So, yeah, I get it.

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:40.385
But it's too late now.

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:42.303
We're done.

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:43.845
Show's over.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.057
Curtain's closed.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.850
How could you say that?

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:50.019
'Cause it's true. Look around.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.022
I am looking around.
And you know what I see?

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.984
That we're trapped in prison
and there's no way out.

01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:59.153
I see someone who never gave up.

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:02.657
Someone who could always turn
a situation around and make it better.

01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:07.662
Someone who has always been optimistic
and positive and hopeful and...

01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:12.750
and sweet, but for some reason
never felt like he was good enough.

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:16.796
You may not see how great you are,
but I do.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.172
I always have.

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:21.759
I came back for you.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.262
What?

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:26.264
I can back for you, Swifty.

01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:27.181
For you.

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:39.694
Aw.

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:42.196
That's just beautiful, man.

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:53.082
Jade!

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.877
- Huh? What?
- What is happening?

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.128
Swifty!

01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.756
Oh!

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:06.012
Oh! I do love a captive audience.

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:09.474
My goodness, is that Magda?

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:13.770
I almost didn't recognize you.
You've aged terribly.

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:17.106
Magda should have mailed Walrus
to prison years ago.

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.984
Otto von Walrus,
you don't have to do this.

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:22.779
Oh, but I do, my dear boy.

01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:27.408
Now, in case you didn't already think
you were in hot water,

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:30.661
allow me to be painfully literal.

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:44.133
Good-bye, you fabulous group
of simpletons. Ta-ta.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:00.691
Jade, you okay?

01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:02.693
I'll be better once I get us out of here.

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:06.948
We still don't trust her.

01:12:07.031 --> 01:12:08.366
But you trust me, right?

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:09.951
Now, we need to come together,

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:13.037
'cause that's the only way
we're getting out of here. Together.

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:16.123
Jade!

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:19.377
Ah!

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:26.300
Ah...

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:27.593
Oh...

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.096
Trust me now?

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:31.973
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Okay, yeah, that'll do.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.019
Everyone out. Let's go.

01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:38.938
All aboard!

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.524
Careful with the antlers.

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:45.486
PB, can you throw us up there?

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:46.821
Wah!

01:12:47.238 --> 01:12:48.197
Whoa!

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:53.995
I can't do this.

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:56.664
PB, come on.
You can do this. Jump.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:57.748
Oh...

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:02.044
You're right.
There's no way you can do this.

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:04.797
Reverse psychology. Nice.

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:12.805
Someone has to turn off
the controls up there.

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:15.808
Lemmy, fly.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:18.227
What? Oh. Excuse me.

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:22.189
No, not that fly. You're the only one
who can get the controls.

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:23.524
You have to fly.

01:13:23.608 --> 01:13:24.901
Oh, man.

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:27.236
I'm afraid of heights.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.947
We need you, Lemmy.
We need you to fly.

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:31.616
Plus, this'll help.

01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:33.534
Oh, hey, wait. It's too far.

01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:35.411
I'll never make it.

01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:37.538
You can do it. You know you can.

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:40.333
Okay.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:42.251
- <i>Bon voyage.</i>
- Ah!

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:47.423
Huh?

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:51.218
Look at me!

01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:54.639
Look at me, Ma. I'm flying!

01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:55.973
Pull the lever.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:13:59.936
All right.

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:02.271
Lemmy!

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:05.483
Oops. Wrong way.Sorry.

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:12.114
No, Lemmy!

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:20.039
I see all systems are a-go.
And how are our guests doing?

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.669
Screams of agony. Wonderful.

01:14:24.752 --> 01:14:29.340
Looks like Taigasville
is in for a floody good time.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:44.438
Stop, stop, stop!

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:55.282
How about that, guys?

01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:57.451
Perfect landing.

01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:00.663
Listen, I put a self-destruct
in the control panel.

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:01.914
All right, Jade!

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:04.792
All I have to do is trigger
the self-destruct with this remote.

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:09.463
Oh, no, it must have fallen into the water
when I jumped out of the cage.

01:15:09.547 --> 01:15:11.757
Anybody want to go for swim?

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.884
Is there any other way
to trigger the self-destruct?

01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:15.553
Well, yes, but...

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:17.013
But what? What is it?

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:18.472
You have to do it manually.

01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:19.724
Okay, how? Where's the panel?

01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:21.851
- On top of the drill.
- Which...

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:23.561
Will then self destruct.

01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:28.607
Okay. Just help me get to that drill.

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:38.284
There's something you don't see every day.

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:48.294
I love a good turnout.

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:50.755
Time to break the ice.

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:44.016
Citizens of Taigasville,
if I might have your attention.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.436
Drum roll, please.

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:50.940
It's just an expression.

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:52.775
Where was I?

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:58.989
Oh, yes. The good news is
I'm here to unleash the devastating power

01:16:59.073 --> 01:17:03.702
of an ancient gas
buried deep beneath Taigasville.

01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:06.288
The bad news is...

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:08.624
I'll have to destroy your town
to get at it.

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:09.542
No!

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:11.085
Chins up, everyone.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:26.058
<i>Five minutes to impact.</i>

01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:29.228
Yes, very nice. Jolly good.
Jolly, jolly good.

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:33.274
Whoa.

01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:37.194
We've got to hurry. Let's go.

01:17:38.028 --> 01:17:41.198
I hope you've all
been practicing your doggy paddle.

01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:46.787
<i>Four minutes to impact.</i>

01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:49.039
Ah. Shouldn't be long now.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:51.959
Oh, what is it?

01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:54.879
Oh, for pete's sake.

01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:58.174
Will someone please take care of them
once and for all?

01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:12.188
Get him, yeah.

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:14.106
Oh, wonderful. Thank you.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:17.693
We need to find a clear path to the drill.
We're pinned down here.

01:18:17.776 --> 01:18:19.111
It's all good, bro.

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:21.363
I don't think we're...

01:18:21.488 --> 01:18:23.407
stuck.

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.701
If we move at all, they will see us.

01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:27.286
Let me double-check.

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:31.999
They saw me.

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:35.586
- They won't see me.
- Uh...

01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:39.006
Where's his clothes?

01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:40.758
Yeah, let's go streaking.

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.426
No, no, Lemmy. Watch.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:49.558
Yeah.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:53.604
Swifty, this is crazy. I can't let you
do this. You could be killed.

01:18:53.687 --> 01:18:55.105
- I have to, Jade.
- You don't.

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:57.358
Look, there's no other way,
and you know it.

01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:59.276
I'm the only one who has a chance.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.654
Look, I'm still gonna need some help
getting to that drill.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:02.988
Magda clear way.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:11.247
Magda with Special Forces, lifetime ago.

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:12.414
Yeah.

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:19.171
Get ready.

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:20.089
On my mark.

01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:26.762
Jade, tell me what I need to do again.

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:29.348
Pull the surge capacitor,
third from the bottom right.

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:30.641
Right from the bottom third.

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:33.310
- Third from the bottom right.
- Third from the right from the bottom.

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:35.187
- No!
- The red one.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.146
Red one. Got it.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.231
- Swifty.
- What?

01:19:37.314 --> 01:19:40.818
It's going to start coming apart,
so get off that rig as soon as you can.

01:19:40.901 --> 01:19:41.986
I hear you.

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:44.613
- Swifty.
- What?

01:19:51.412 --> 01:19:52.955
Um, guys.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:55.374
I'll see you soon.

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:56.500
Charge!

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:00.546
Bring it to Magda, puffin scum!

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:06.719
Sorry!

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:13.767
Yeah!

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:18.188
Whoo-hoo!

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:21.442
Ooh!

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:38.625
I got your back!

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:40.336
Going up.

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:45.049
Yeah!

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.642
Stop him!

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:09.782
Duke!

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.075
Arctic strong!

01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:15.913
Ah!

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:22.127
Do your thing, Top Dog.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:50.697
- Special delivery.
- Wah!

01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.866
You!

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:55.702
I'll make a rug out of your hide.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:00.165
Stop that naked jackaninny!

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:09.716
<i>One minute to impact.</i>

01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:13.220
Yah!

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:23.105
<i>Forty seconds to impact.</i>

01:22:27.526 --> 01:22:28.360
Ah!

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:33.782
No!

01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:40.664
Take that. That, you...

01:22:41.331 --> 01:22:44.168
<i>Twenty seconds to impact.</i>

01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:46.211
You can't stop me.

01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:48.213
Ah!

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:56.555
- <i>Ten seconds to impact.</i>
- Where'd he go?

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:04.062
<i>Two seconds.</i>

01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:07.107
No!

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:10.194
He did it!

01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:16.575
Swifty, get off of there!

01:23:17.284 --> 01:23:19.369
Whoa! It's going to blow!

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:21.288
Swifty.

01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:22.456
Help me.

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:26.418
Don't leave me here, please.

01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:29.922
Here.

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:31.965
Thank you...

01:23:32.049 --> 01:23:33.800
for being an idiot!

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:37.346
Ah!

01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:41.183
Swifty!

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:44.770
Puffins, it's time for my escape.
Let's go.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:47.606
Come and get me, you little freaks.

01:23:48.273 --> 01:23:49.483
Where are you?

01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:52.444
Swifty! Oh, no.

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:21.348
Oh, there you are.

01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:25.143
Listen, puffins, I know
it doesn't look good, but it's not over.

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:27.229
We can still win this.

01:24:27.312 --> 01:24:30.274
True, everything's been destroyed,
but that doesn't mean

01:24:30.357 --> 01:24:33.485
we can't keep on fighting on and on

01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:36.321
and start over and...

01:24:48.292 --> 01:24:50.794
All right, guys,
that's it. We're out of here.

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:53.839
You can talk!

01:24:54.172 --> 01:25:00.095
Come! Come back.
I order you to come back this instant!

01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:02.931
Please?

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:06.059
Please!

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:14.610
Oh! Hello, angry mob of townsfolk.

01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:16.278
How are we today?

01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:19.072
Nice to see you're not converging
on me to do...

01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:21.366
Oh, I see, you are converging on me.

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:23.619
Uh, well, I...

01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:28.790
Swifty, where are you?

01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:31.001
Swifty!

01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:34.296
Swifty.

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.675
Thank goodness you're alive.

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:41.011
But I'm blind.

01:25:41.094 --> 01:25:42.054
I'm blind!

01:25:44.097 --> 01:25:47.726
Ah! I'm not blind.

01:25:48.185 --> 01:25:49.394
I can see.

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:52.230
Look at... Look, I can see. Ow!

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:53.565
We did it.

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:55.484
We did, didn't we?

01:25:58.987 --> 01:25:59.863
Oh!

01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.906
Sorry.

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:01.823
That's okay.

01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:09.998
Hey, Swifty.
You're the best Top Dog ever.

01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:13.043
You know what?
I'm no Top Dog.

01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:14.961
I'm just a fox.

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:20.717
- Yeah!
- It's streaking time, dudes.

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.053
Yeah.

01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:28.141
All right. Yeah!

01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:33.689
<i>After that,
Magda actually allowed me</i>

01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:36.400
<i>to make some changes around the old ABDS.</i>

01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:42.114
<i>PB became
the health and wellness supervisor</i>

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:44.991
<i>and that helped boost
employee morale through the roof.</i>

01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:55.711
<i>Now that Lemmy was flying free, he became
a one-man centralized processing system.</i>

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:56.670
Whoa!

01:26:56.753 --> 01:26:57.838
<i>Oh, look at him go.</i>

01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:00.382
<i>And Bertha and Leo?</i>

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.884
<i>Well, they were
natural safety and security officers.</i>

01:27:11.435 --> 01:27:14.938
<i>But the one I am most proud of
is the new fleet.</i>

01:27:15.021 --> 01:27:19.109
<i>Now anyone can be Top Animal,
not just dogs,</i>

01:27:19.192 --> 01:27:22.028
<i>because everyone has something unique
and special to offer.</i>

01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:24.072
Who's ready
for some serious rock climbing?

01:27:24.156 --> 01:27:26.158
That's what I was born to do, boss.

01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:28.869
Hey, looking good, guys.

01:27:30.871 --> 01:27:33.623
I know none of these will get
crushed now with you on the job.

01:27:33.707 --> 01:27:35.083
You can count on me.

01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:38.336
<i>And as for the Top Dogs?</i>

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:41.006
<i>They finally got the retirement
they long deserved.</i>

01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:44.342
<i>Oh, and Otto von Walrus?</i>

01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:47.179
<i>Let's just say he packed up and left.</i>

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:48.430
Hello.

01:27:48.638 --> 01:27:52.225
Can somebody let me out?

01:27:54.144 --> 01:27:55.187
Please?

01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:01.234
Hey, did you see this?

01:28:05.071 --> 01:28:06.573
Yeah, that's neat.

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:10.285
Look, I found something in your warehouse
that needed some fixing.

01:28:15.916 --> 01:28:17.250
<i>Dreams do come true...</i>

01:28:18.001 --> 01:28:20.837
<i>though not always the way
you expect them to.</i>

01:28:20.921 --> 01:28:24.216
<i>In the end, it took someone special
to help me see that.</i>

01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:27.886
Arctic strong!

01:28:33.725 --> 01:28:36.937
<i>Recognition and being noticed,
it's okay.</i>

01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:40.816
<i>Well, a little bit more than okay,
but what really matters...</i>

01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:44.194
<i>is doing what you can,
however big or small,</i>

01:28:44.277 --> 01:28:48.824
<i>to make the world a better place
and being true to yourself along the way.</i>

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:55.080
Yeah!

01:32:11.013 --> 01:32:16.013
