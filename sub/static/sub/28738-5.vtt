00:01.280 --> 00:03.250
<i>Previously on</i>
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.250 --> 00:05.190
The Commander
wants to reconcile,

00:05.190 --> 00:07.080
but he doesn't know
how to do it so,

00:07.080 --> 00:08.840
I made a suggestion.

00:08.840 --> 00:10.160
Could you maybe give her

00:10.160 --> 00:11.780
a real voice?
Behind the scenes.

00:11.780 --> 00:13.500
If that would fix things.

00:13.500 --> 00:14.680
It's worth discussing.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.200
Wear the dress.
Pull the strings.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.040
Have you found her respectful?

00:20.040 --> 00:22.870
We've had trouble
with her in the past.

00:22.870 --> 00:25.040
Yes.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.340
I want to go now.

00:27.340 --> 00:29.070
All right, my love.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.860
A young girl of Hannah's age

00:30.860 --> 00:33.320
would attend a school
for domestic arts.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.240
The one in her district
is in Brookline,

00:35.240 --> 00:36.750
by the reservoir.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.940
Thank you, S...

00:39.960 --> 00:41.420
You know that man?

00:41.420 --> 00:43.320
Is it Lucas Bankole?

00:43.320 --> 00:44.700
I love you.

00:45.800 --> 00:46.870
Yes.

00:47.470 --> 00:49.400
She's gotten so big.

<i>She's safe.</i>

01:21.440 --> 01:22.620
<i>She's with Luke.</i>

01:26.860 --> 01:28.240
<i>May He and His goodness</i>

01:28.240 --> 01:30.450
<i>bless us with miracles,</i>

01:30.450 --> 01:31.910

01:31.910 --> 01:33.540
<i>and weak of faith.</i>

01:39.520 --> 01:41.870
<i>Maybe it's not a miracle.</i>

01:41.870 --> 01:44.900
<i>A miracle is beyond
human powers.</i>

01:46.030 --> 01:48.660
<i>I did this.</i>

01:48.660 --> 01:50.520
<i>We.</i>

01:52.820 --> 01:55.230
<i>It's a dream.</i>

01:55.230 --> 01:57.060
<i>The only dream for a Handmaid</i>

01:57.060 --> 01:58.870
<i>in Gilead.</i>

01:59.890 --> 02:01.660
<i>My baby is free.</i>

02:01.660 --> 02:03.680
Praise be.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.870
<i>They could resent me.</i>

02:05.870 --> 02:07.190
<i>I wouldn't blame them.</i>

02:07.190 --> 02:08.410
Praise be.

02:08.410 --> 02:11.880
<i>Instead of resentment,
they offer grace.</i>

02:11.880 --> 02:15.000
<i>A victory for one
is a victory for all.</i>

02:22.450 --> 02:25.440
<i>I want him here so badly.</i>

02:25.440 --> 02:27.400
<i>I want to be held</i>

02:27.400 --> 02:29.410
<i>and told my name.</i>

02:31.430 --> 02:35.040
<i>Absence makes
the heart grow fonder.</i>

02:35.040 --> 02:36.490
<i>Maybe.</i>

02:37.510 --> 02:39.140
<i>What about the rest of me?</i>

02:45.520 --> 02:48.250
<i>The night we made Hannah.</i>

02:48.250 --> 02:49.910
<i>If I thought</i>

02:49.910 --> 02:52.230
<i>I would never touch him again,</i>

02:52.230 --> 02:54.740
<i>never have him,</i>

02:54.740 --> 02:56.750
<i>I would die.</i>

02:59.650 --> 03:02.030
<i>But nobody dies
from lack of sex.</i>

03:05.370 --> 03:07.370
<i>It's lack of love we die from.</i>

03:10.030 --> 03:11.280
I pray for your husband.

03:14.250 --> 03:16.270
That is kind of you, Ofmatthew.

03:18.030 --> 03:19.670
I pray he returns Baby Nichole

03:19.670 --> 03:21.670
to her rightful home.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.250
Her rightful home
is with her parents.

03:26.250 --> 03:27.860
Praise be.

03:33.650 --> 03:35.980
I know he'll do the right thing.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.670
You wouldn't have married a man

03:37.670 --> 03:40.460
who is actually capable
of kidnapping.

03:40.460 --> 03:43.240
You have much better
judgement than that.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.270
Under His eye.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.810
Bite me.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.440
Sienna?

04:04.440 --> 04:05.460
Sienna?

04:07.870 --> 04:09.880
Never mind.

04:11.190 --> 04:12.670
Did you do...

04:12.670 --> 04:14.670
something different?

04:18.440 --> 04:20.649
Your hair.

04:20.649 --> 04:22.060
A little.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.660
It looks nice.

04:24.660 --> 04:26.860
Like it used to.

04:26.860 --> 04:28.880
Thank you.

04:30.480 --> 04:31.640
Good morning, dear.

04:33.670 --> 04:35.050
Good morning,
Mrs. Lawrence.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.770
Blessed day, Commander.

04:47.770 --> 04:49.780
The answer
is "no."

04:52.060 --> 04:53.090
You want something.

04:53.090 --> 04:54.520
I can tell.

05:04.870 --> 05:06.020
I just need to know

05:06.020 --> 05:08.290
if my husband is safe.

05:08.290 --> 05:09.880
I don't know.
Does he use a seat belt?

05:09.880 --> 05:10.880
Does he watch
his blood pressure?

05:10.880 --> 05:13.240
That's the silent killer,
you know.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.690
They know where he is now.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.040
They know he has my daughter.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.740
And isn't that what you wanted?

05:25.010 --> 05:27.350
Do you think they
would try to hurt him?

05:28.360 --> 05:29.910
They?

05:32.720 --> 05:34.420
Do you think he's in danger?

05:35.590 --> 05:37.530
We're all in danger.

05:51.130 --> 05:52.520
What a blessing.

05:54.770 --> 05:57.040
To have seen her.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.010
To know that she's all right.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.970
She's with a stranger.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.490
A stranger to you.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.650
Yes.

06:06.650 --> 06:08.240
To me.

06:12.660 --> 06:13.670
You're finished already?

06:13.670 --> 06:15.020
What did they say?

06:15.020 --> 06:17.690
Oh, they've just gotten started.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.620
I'd like you to join us.

06:26.340 --> 06:28.330
You have a say in this.

06:45.050 --> 06:46.240
We lodged

06:46.240 --> 06:48.060
a preliminary complaint
to Canada,

06:48.060 --> 06:50.260
petitioning
for Nichole's return.

06:50.260 --> 06:51.650
And we will follow up.

06:51.650 --> 06:52.660
A child of Gilead

06:52.660 --> 06:54.040
has been kidnapped.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.250
You're suggesting we send them

06:55.250 --> 06:57.480
another stern note?

06:57.480 --> 06:59.870
No, Commander.
I'm saying

06:59.870 --> 07:01.860
that our options are limited

07:01.860 --> 07:03.260
without an extradition treaty.

07:03.260 --> 07:05.250
Gentlemen.

07:05.250 --> 07:08.040
Pray excuse me.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.070
Serena?

07:14.660 --> 07:16.250
I'd like to know about the man

07:16.250 --> 07:18.470
who is raising her.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.110
He worked in the...

07:29.110 --> 07:32.740
Suffolk County Office
of Urban Planning.

07:32.740 --> 07:33.750
Before.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.070
And now?

07:36.070 --> 07:37.460
Part-time construction

07:37.460 --> 07:39.230
and utility work.

07:39.230 --> 07:40.890
He receives...

07:40.890 --> 07:41.960
refugee aid.

07:44.780 --> 07:46.020
Is he a man of faith?

07:46.020 --> 07:47.440
Of course not.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.870
He did baptize

07:48.870 --> 07:50.870
his first child.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.460
But, to our knowledge,
that's the extent

07:52.460 --> 07:54.260
of his religious activities.

07:54.260 --> 07:57.020
We have been able to access

07:57.020 --> 07:59.020
some medical records.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.450
Nichole's up to date

08:00.450 --> 08:01.530
on her vaccinations.

08:01.530 --> 08:04.070
She's measuring
60th percentile for height

08:04.070 --> 08:06.930
and 55th for weight.

08:06.930 --> 08:07.960
And...

08:10.430 --> 08:12.630
It says here she has a tooth.

08:23.020 --> 08:24.990
And we will do whatever it takes

08:24.990 --> 08:27.120
to bring her back home to you.

08:44.070 --> 08:46.080
I thought this is
what you wanted.

08:48.030 --> 08:50.350
Our daughter's safe.

08:50.350 --> 08:51.600
In Canada.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.870
I'm grateful.

08:54.870 --> 08:56.190
But?

08:58.220 --> 08:59.570
Help me understand.

08:59.570 --> 09:02.220
What is it that you want?

09:02.220 --> 09:03.680
I want to be with her,

09:03.680 --> 09:05.700
but that's impossible.

09:11.070 --> 09:13.090
I just want this to be over.

09:30.050 --> 09:31.250
They're here for you.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.910
In the parlor.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.660
Ofjoseph.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.700
Blessed be the fruit.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.360
May the Lord open.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.670
They're just here
to have a conversation.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.090
Sit.

10:28.080 --> 10:32.250
We'd like to arrange...

10:32.250 --> 10:34.720
a visit with Nichole.

10:37.850 --> 10:40.750
As you can imagine,

10:40.750 --> 10:42.850
seeing our daughter
has opened up

10:42.850 --> 10:45.990
a terrible wound
for Mrs. Waterford.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.470
Just one visit to say goodbye.

10:49.470 --> 10:51.950
Your husband will be protected.

10:53.840 --> 10:54.870
My husband?

10:54.870 --> 10:57.040
<i>Everyone</i> will be protected.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.040
You have my word.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.060
Mine as well.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.150
Your word?

11:07.040 --> 11:08.730
What do I have to do?

11:10.690 --> 11:12.330
Call your husband.

11:21.060 --> 11:23.080
No.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.400
Will you please
give us a moment?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.030
Of course.

11:46.870 --> 11:48.870
No.

11:59.460 --> 12:00.650
I know that

12:00.650 --> 12:03.460
I can't be with her.

12:03.460 --> 12:05.220
I just want to be
something <i>to</i> her.

12:05.220 --> 12:07.240
That's not gonna help.

12:09.010 --> 12:10.640
Okay?

12:11.890 --> 12:13.250
It's not gonna be
what you think.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.020
Please.

12:15.020 --> 12:17.670
Please.
I am begging you.

12:19.590 --> 12:20.600
June.

12:29.230 --> 12:31.210
You don't think I wanna see her?

12:41.710 --> 12:44.880
If I do this,

12:44.880 --> 12:46.430
what do I get?

12:48.250 --> 12:50.040
You get to see her.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.000
So...

12:53.260 --> 12:55.970
what do I get?

12:58.030 --> 12:59.560
What do you want?

13:01.040 --> 13:03.680
I want you to owe me.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.590
Under His eye.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.060
You have two minutes.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.970
It's $47.56.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.860
This will barely
last us the week.

13:48.860 --> 13:51.390
How do people
pay for this stuff?

13:51.390 --> 13:54.320
Most don't need it.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.920
All right.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.050
All right, see ya.

13:59.050 --> 14:00.680
Hmm.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.120
Hello.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.260
<i>Hello?</i>

14:07.260 --> 14:08.880
<i>Who is this?</i>

14:08.880 --> 14:10.470
Luke.

14:11.470 --> 14:12.640
It's me.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.230
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

14:16.230 --> 14:17.630
Oh, God.

14:17.630 --> 14:18.640
June?

14:18.640 --> 14:20.260
<i>Oh!</i>

14:20.260 --> 14:21.860
Hi.

14:21.860 --> 14:24.030
<i>June, I, uh...</i>

14:24.030 --> 14:25.150
<i>Oh, June.</i>

14:25.150 --> 14:27.810
I'm okay, Luke.
Hannah's okay.

14:27.810 --> 14:30.120
<i>She's all right.</i>

14:30.120 --> 14:32.050
Where... where are you?

14:32.050 --> 14:34.060
<i>Still here.
I'm in Gilead.</i>

14:38.360 --> 14:39.680
June, um...

14:39.680 --> 14:40.800
I love...

14:40.800 --> 14:42.210
I love you.

14:42.210 --> 14:43.650
<i>I love you so much.</i>

14:43.650 --> 14:46.300
I love you.

14:46.300 --> 14:47.320
God, I love you.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.870
<i>I love you.</i>

14:48.870 --> 14:50.870
<i>Oh, baby.
I... I miss you.</i>

14:50.870 --> 14:53.040
<i>I think about you every day.</i>

14:53.040 --> 14:54.470
<i>I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.</i>

14:54.470 --> 14:57.150
- Don't.
<i>- I...</i>

14:57.150 --> 14:58.270
Don't be sorry.

14:58.270 --> 15:00.760
No, I should've tried
harder to find you.

15:01.530 --> 15:03.320
<i>And Hannah.</i>

15:03.320 --> 15:05.650
I don't have much time.

15:06.690 --> 15:08.310
Yeah. Are you...
Are you all right?

15:08.310 --> 15:09.360
Did they hurt you?

15:11.060 --> 15:12.260
No.

15:12.260 --> 15:14.030
<i>Are they there?</i>

15:14.030 --> 15:15.050
<i>Are they listening?</i>

15:15.050 --> 15:16.900
Luke, please.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.050
I'm all right.
I promise.

15:19.050 --> 15:20.300
I need you to listen to me.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.100
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, baby.</i>

15:22.100 --> 15:24.050
I need you to do
something for me.

15:24.050 --> 15:25.680
<i>Yeah, anything.</i>

15:25.680 --> 15:26.790
I need you to go to

15:26.790 --> 15:28.250
the Toronto airport tomorrow

15:28.250 --> 15:30.100
and meet the Waterfords,

15:30.100 --> 15:32.610
and bring Nichole.

15:35.230 --> 15:36.870
<i>Luke.</i>

15:39.670 --> 15:41.040
- Luke.
<i>- Yeah. I'm...</i>

15:41.040 --> 15:42.690
<i>I'm... I'm here.</i>

15:43.930 --> 15:45.740
June...

15:45.740 --> 15:48.100
You want me to meet
the Waterfords?

15:48.100 --> 15:49.110
<i>Just once.</i>

15:49.110 --> 15:50.870
<i>To say goodbye.</i>

15:50.870 --> 15:51.890
<i>You'll get another call</i>

15:51.890 --> 15:53.190
<i>with all of the details.</i>

15:56.600 --> 15:58.290
Please.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.290
I need you to say yes.

16:03.650 --> 16:05.640
Not him.

16:05.640 --> 16:06.670
Not him.

16:06.670 --> 16:08.300
Just her.

16:10.030 --> 16:11.670
<i>Okay.</i>

16:12.960 --> 16:13.970
Okay.

16:13.970 --> 16:15.880
<i>Okay.</i>

16:15.880 --> 16:17.880
I love you.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.490
May I be dismissed, sir?

16:54.250 --> 16:55.980
You may.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.260
God bless you.

18:12.140 --> 18:14.170
How did she sound?

18:22.720 --> 18:24.580
Like June.

18:51.810 --> 18:53.360
How are you holding up, dear?

18:55.920 --> 18:57.230
Very well,
Mrs. Lawrence.

18:57.230 --> 18:58.860
Thank you.

19:00.860 --> 19:03.670
That must've been painful,

19:03.670 --> 19:05.710
after all that time.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.570
It didn't go quite
as I'd imagined.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.160
What matters...

19:22.260 --> 19:23.270
is...

19:23.270 --> 19:24.890
that...

19:24.890 --> 19:27.320
your love came through.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.150
Sometimes words fail us.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.070
My husband used music.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.460
He used to curate cassette tapes

19:40.460 --> 19:42.210
for me in college.

19:43.330 --> 19:44.860
Hmm.

19:44.860 --> 19:46.260
I still have them

19:46.260 --> 19:48.000
in the basement.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.670
Do you ever listen to them?

19:55.640 --> 19:57.240
I...

19:57.240 --> 19:59.840
I miss the man who made them.

20:09.790 --> 20:12.670
Maybe there's just

20:12.670 --> 20:14.580
a little bit of him left.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.520
He helped me.

20:20.740 --> 20:22.770
He helped Emily.

20:30.030 --> 20:31.660
I think...

20:34.580 --> 20:37.620
it's okay to take
a sliver of someone...

20:39.960 --> 20:41.970
and hold on to that.

20:47.730 --> 20:50.700
Especially if it's all you have.

Your breakfast,
Mrs. Waterford.

23:32.190 --> 23:35.030
I'm still full from dinner.

23:35.030 --> 23:37.870
Well, for the flight then.

23:37.870 --> 23:39.890
Do you think
that she'll like it?

23:53.440 --> 23:55.870
"For this child
I prayed."

23:59.920 --> 24:01.720
Oh, it's beautiful.

24:05.250 --> 24:07.700
Would you give her a kiss
from me, please?

24:10.330 --> 24:12.730
Of course.

24:22.470 --> 24:24.640
Ma'am, there's something else.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.680
It arrived last night.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.550
What is it?

24:31.550 --> 24:33.580
It didn't have
my name on it, ma'am.

24:39.020 --> 24:40.030
The car is here.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.130
I'll wrap this up
for the flight.

24:43.130 --> 24:44.550
Thank you, Rita.

25:17.840 --> 25:18.880
Let's go.

25:54.460 --> 25:55.590
Blessed day,
Mrs. Waterford.

25:56.660 --> 25:57.880
Under His eye.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.210
Mrs. Waterford.

26:23.210 --> 26:25.220
Welcome.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.570
Mr. Tuello.

26:30.570 --> 26:32.870
You remember me.
I'm flattered.

26:32.870 --> 26:35.880
I'm just here to make sure
this goes smoothly.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.180
I know how to conduct myself.

26:40.030 --> 26:42.080
Mr. Tuello will take it
from here.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.220
The Commander
gave me strict orders.

26:44.220 --> 26:45.440
I speak for the Commander

26:45.440 --> 26:46.750
in his absence.

26:46.750 --> 26:49.460
Yes, Mrs. Waterford.

26:49.460 --> 26:51.260
It's a short drive
to the terminal.

26:51.260 --> 26:52.880
You'll change there.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.030
I'm sorry?

26:54.030 --> 26:55.050
Mr. Bankole
requested

26:55.050 --> 26:57.010
a more public meeting place.

26:57.900 --> 27:00.870
We brought you
a change of clothes.

27:00.870 --> 27:02.900
We want you to blend in.

27:17.450 --> 27:19.490
Right this way,
Mrs. Waterford.

27:21.790 --> 27:23.050
<i>Attention passengers</i>

27:23.050 --> 27:25.650

27:36.240 --> 27:38.090

27:51.250 --> 27:52.250
I'll introduce you.

27:52.250 --> 27:54.260
No.
Not yet.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.040
Serena Waterford.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.320
Luke Bankole.

28:23.630 --> 28:24.660
Hello.

28:27.350 --> 28:28.370
I could stay.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.370
I leave that up
to Mr. Bankole.

28:35.890 --> 28:37.030
You can go.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.280
I won't be far.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.430
God bless you.

28:46.430 --> 28:48.300
Fuck you.

28:49.510 --> 28:52.150
I understand this wasn't
an easy choice for you.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.270
I thank you for making it.

28:56.650 --> 28:59.270
I did this for my wife.

29:21.440 --> 29:24.250
She's gained so much weight.

29:24.250 --> 29:26.030
She started eating solids yet?

29:26.870 --> 29:28.880
She's not a fan of the peas.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.590
Is June okay?

29:33.250 --> 29:35.320
Yes.
She's been reassigned.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.610
Where?

29:36.610 --> 29:38.060
I want a name.

29:38.060 --> 29:40.260
Your wife is
perfectly safe, Mr. Bankole.

29:40.260 --> 29:41.990
That's a lie.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.850
His name is Joseph Lawrence.

30:00.580 --> 30:02.600
I know.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.940
What do you want out of this?

30:08.220 --> 30:09.380
This visit?

30:10.330 --> 30:12.630
I just wanted
to see my daughter.

30:12.630 --> 30:13.730
She's not your daughter.

30:13.730 --> 30:15.320
Or yours.

30:16.460 --> 30:17.680
Okay, you understand

30:17.680 --> 30:18.900
this is not about biology,

30:18.900 --> 30:20.800
and I hope that you'll
explain that to her

30:20.800 --> 30:22.000
when she's old enough
to understand.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.180
She'll never be old enough
to understand.

30:23.180 --> 30:24.450
Every child has a right

30:24.450 --> 30:25.770
- to their own story.
- Yeah?

30:25.770 --> 30:27.340
Even if that story
is complicated.

30:27.340 --> 30:29.210
And what's your husband's
role in that story?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.560
I'd like for Nichole
to have this.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.310
This was a gift from my father,

30:52.310 --> 30:53.330
God rest his soul.

30:53.330 --> 30:54.890
I don't know what it is

30:54.890 --> 30:56.880
that you tell yourself

30:56.880 --> 30:58.840
so that, you know,
you can sleep at night,

30:58.840 --> 31:00.680
but Nichole is gonna know

31:00.680 --> 31:02.770
exactly where she came from,

31:02.770 --> 31:06.040
and how brave her <i>mother</i> was

31:06.040 --> 31:07.450
for getting her here.

31:07.450 --> 31:09.450
That's her story.

31:09.450 --> 31:11.520
All right?

31:11.520 --> 31:13.790
You're never gonna be
anything to her.

31:18.870 --> 31:21.070
You wanna know
what I tell myself?

31:22.340 --> 31:24.350
That she was my miracle,

31:26.240 --> 31:28.250
and that I let her go.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.410
Because I wanted
a better life for her,

31:33.410 --> 31:35.540
and so did your wife.

31:35.540 --> 31:37.250
Okay?

31:37.250 --> 31:39.240
So.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.060
If you can't honor
my wishes then...

31:42.060 --> 31:43.270
honor hers.

31:44.440 --> 31:47.250
Please, give this to Nichole,

31:47.250 --> 31:49.480
and let her draw
her own conclusions.

31:52.050 --> 31:54.490
You need to understand
that I protected your wife.

32:00.890 --> 32:02.540
What did you say?

32:04.700 --> 32:05.740
You what?

32:05.740 --> 32:07.490
I'm sorry,
but we need to wrap this up.

32:07.490 --> 32:08.880
Good.

32:11.250 --> 32:13.250
Yeah, good, good.

32:13.250 --> 32:15.500
Okay, I'll take it.

32:21.550 --> 32:22.560
Is there something

32:22.560 --> 32:24.580
you want me to tell your wife?

32:28.230 --> 32:30.180
No.

32:32.900 --> 32:34.940
I love you, my sweet girl.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.280
I love you so much.

32:41.440 --> 32:43.700
I love you.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.800
Do you wanna hold her?

32:49.210 --> 32:50.220
Yes, please.

32:56.660 --> 32:58.290
Oh, my baby girl.

33:00.530 --> 33:01.880
Hi.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.520
Oh, oh!

33:26.360 --> 33:28.360
You don't have to change back.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.630
My offer still stands.

33:30.630 --> 33:32.040
Treason and coconuts.

33:33.670 --> 33:36.660
I only have one home,
Mr. Tuello.

33:36.660 --> 33:38.710
You understand that, don't you?

33:38.710 --> 33:41.100
Yes.

33:41.100 --> 33:43.750
I used to live in Atlanta.

33:43.750 --> 33:46.000
Well, I hope you
get back there someday.

Your Commander must be pleased?

38:14.880 --> 38:16.450
I haven't told him yet.

38:17.450 --> 38:18.850
Not with everyone so concerned

38:18.850 --> 38:20.060
over baby Nichole.

38:20.060 --> 38:22.640
There hasn't been a moment.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.410
I'm glad she's safe.

38:31.570 --> 38:33.220
Your husband, too.

38:34.970 --> 38:36.610
Thanks.

38:40.230 --> 38:42.140
You, too.

38:44.050 --> 38:47.100
I really think
everything's gonna be okay.

39:03.130 --> 39:04.790
Ofjoseph.

39:07.100 --> 39:09.290
Please come with me.

<i>Luke.</i>

40:55.440 --> 40:57.130
<i>Hi.</i>

40:58.580 --> 41:00.240
This is so weird.

41:02.890 --> 41:04.710
And I'm sorry.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.060
I'm sorry about that.

41:08.030 --> 41:10.330
<i>But...</i>

41:10.330 --> 41:12.520
<i>there are some things
that I need to tell you</i>

41:12.520 --> 41:14.240
<i>that I couldn't...</i>

41:14.240 --> 41:15.920
<i>before.</i>

41:18.030 --> 41:20.200
I can't imagine

41:20.200 --> 41:22.440
what you thought when you met...

41:22.440 --> 41:24.430
Nichole.

41:25.270 --> 41:28.210
<i>But you were probably
thinking a lot less</i>

41:28.210 --> 41:31.280
<i>about her journey
across the border</i>

41:31.280 --> 41:35.150
<i>and more about her journey
into the world.</i>

41:38.950 --> 41:42.830
It's not easy
to tell you this...

41:47.330 --> 41:49.350
'cause I am ashamed.

41:52.650 --> 41:56.340
<i>I had to build a life here.</i>

41:57.710 --> 41:59.840
<i>Of a sort.</i>

41:59.840 --> 42:00.850
<i>And you should, too.</i>

42:00.850 --> 42:02.710
<i>You deserve a life,</i>

42:02.710 --> 42:05.690
<i>a full life, Luke.</i>

42:05.690 --> 42:07.710
You deserve love.

42:10.290 --> 42:12.300
And you'll always have...

42:13.520 --> 42:15.190
You'll always have mine but...

42:16.660 --> 42:18.450
<i>I understand if...</i>

42:18.450 --> 42:22.230
<i>you maybe need more than that.</i>

42:25.860 --> 42:28.110
I need you to know
that Nichole...

42:30.110 --> 42:32.830
She was born out of love.

42:37.050 --> 42:39.460
<i>Her real name's Holly.</i>

42:41.280 --> 42:42.930
And her...

42:45.190 --> 42:46.420
Her father is a driver

42:46.420 --> 42:47.920
named Nick.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.780
<i>You met him.</i>

42:52.130 --> 42:55.000
He helped me

42:55.000 --> 42:56.430
to survive.

43:01.600 --> 43:04.130
<i>I</i> need <i>to believe that you</i>

43:04.130 --> 43:06.130
<i>can forgive me.</i>

43:08.880 --> 43:11.530
<i>I'm not the woman you remember.</i>

43:13.580 --> 43:16.120
<i>She's part of me.</i>

43:16.120 --> 43:17.660
<i>But I'm doing what I need to,</i>

43:17.660 --> 43:19.080
<i>to survive.</i>

43:20.440 --> 43:22.390
<i>You should, too.</i>

43:23.390 --> 43:25.390
<i>No, you...</i>

43:25.390 --> 43:27.260
<i>You have to.</i>

43:27.260 --> 43:29.720
<i>You have to for Hannah.</i>

43:29.720 --> 43:31.950
<i>It's all for her, Luke.</i>

43:34.040 --> 43:35.660
<i>This is all for her.</i>

43:35.660 --> 43:38.850
<i>I promise you,</i>

43:38.850 --> 43:42.410
<i>I am trying to get to her.</i>

43:42.410 --> 43:44.950
<i>I promise.</i>

43:47.080 --> 43:48.900
I love you.

43:51.750 --> 43:54.460
<i>I love you.</i>

44:01.030 --> 44:03.040
Blessed day, dear.

44:05.830 --> 44:07.150
What's going on?

44:07.150 --> 44:09.180
Well, aren't you a Nosy Nellie?

44:15.840 --> 44:17.490
All right.

44:26.440 --> 44:27.800
All right.

44:28.870 --> 44:30.990
Over here, dear.

44:30.990 --> 44:33.030
Cloak and wings.

44:37.240 --> 44:38.700
Mmm.

44:38.700 --> 44:40.520
Dress and boots, too.

44:42.770 --> 44:44.560
Coming.

44:54.040 --> 44:56.060
Clock's ticking.

45:02.730 --> 45:05.060
Let's get a good look.

45:08.730 --> 45:10.290
Oh...

45:11.300 --> 45:12.660
Lucky girl.

45:45.590 --> 45:46.600
Serena.

45:49.940 --> 45:51.570
Serena!

45:52.650 --> 45:53.930
What did you do?

45:57.870 --> 45:59.500
Posture, dear.

46:01.450 --> 46:03.450
Don't think about being clever.

46:04.450 --> 46:06.470
There are consequences.

46:19.100 --> 46:21.470
Hey. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

46:24.830 --> 46:26.040
Hey!

46:26.040 --> 46:27.900
You gotta see this.

46:29.280 --> 46:31.680
<i>We have
taken the extraordinary step</i>

46:31.680 --> 46:33.940
<i>of addressing
the world directly.</i>

46:34.950 --> 46:36.470
<i>We...</i>

46:36.470 --> 46:38.840
<i>are a family in mourning.</i>

46:38.840 --> 46:40.450
<i>A family devastated</i>

46:40.450 --> 46:41.820
<i>by loss,</i>

46:41.820 --> 46:43.250
<i>desperate for help</i>

46:43.250 --> 46:44.420
<i>and answers.</i>

46:44.420 --> 46:46.450
And we make this request

46:46.450 --> 46:48.030
to the Canadian government

46:48.030 --> 46:50.700
in peace.

46:50.700 --> 46:52.270
Our beloved

46:52.270 --> 46:54.040
baby daughter,

46:54.040 --> 46:55.970
Nichole Waterford,

46:55.970 --> 46:58.320
was kidnapped by
a dangerous fugitive

46:58.320 --> 47:00.360
fleeing our country.

47:01.910 --> 47:03.930
Nichole belongs in Gilead.

47:06.550 --> 47:08.850
We miss her dearly.

47:08.850 --> 47:10.890
We just want her back.

47:12.350 --> 47:13.870
We expect

47:13.870 --> 47:16.460
the government's
<i>full</i> cooperation,

47:17.460 --> 47:18.860
as our daughter

47:18.860 --> 47:21.360
is an innocent victim

47:21.360 --> 47:23.390
with no voice of her own.

47:25.730 --> 47:27.740
This is a family matter.

47:28.850 --> 47:32.410
You can help to keep it this way

47:32.410 --> 47:34.420
by sending her back to us...

47:35.650 --> 47:37.310
...safely.
