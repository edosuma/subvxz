00:29.999 --> 00:31.998
Now, I first thoughtthe
two kids who did this

00:31.999 --> 00:33.998
came fromsomeplace else.

00:33.999 --> 00:36.998
When I learned thatthey
had grown up in laramie,

00:36.999 --> 00:38.999
I was just floored!

00:50.999 --> 00:55.998
In laramie, Wyoming, a young
man is in a deep coma,

00:55.999 --> 00:58.999
near death, from a savage beating.

01:02.999 --> 01:06.999
When I first found out, I
just thought it was horrible.

01:08.042 --> 01:09.998
Nobody deserves that.

01:09.999 --> 01:11.999
I don't carewho you are.

01:14.999 --> 01:17.998
A college freshman was
beaten, tied to a fence,

01:17.999 --> 01:20.999
and left for deadin Wyoming this week.

01:23.999 --> 01:25.998
Certainly you'd liketo
think this was somebody

01:25.999 --> 01:27.998
from out of town.

01:27.999 --> 01:30.999
Somebody who comes throughand
beats somebody up.

01:32.999 --> 01:33.998
But if we're talkingabout somebody

01:33.999 --> 01:36.998
who's been beatenrepeatedly

01:36.999 --> 01:38.998
by somebodyfrom our town...

01:38.999 --> 01:41.999
Well, that certainlyoffends us.

01:46.999 --> 01:48.998
If you asked me before, I would've told you

01:48.999 --> 01:50.998
laramie'sa beautiful town.

01:50.999 --> 01:52.998
It's secluded.

01:52.999 --> 01:53.999
You know, secluded enough

01:54.999 --> 01:57.998
so you canhave your own identity.

01:57.999 --> 01:59.998
You know, now, after Matthew...

01:59.999 --> 02:03.998
We're a town definedby an accident

02:03.999 --> 02:05.998
or a crime, you know?

02:05.999 --> 02:07.998
We've become wacoor Jasper.

02:07.999 --> 02:12.999
We're a nounor a definitionor a sign.

02:23.999 --> 02:25.998
Do you mindif I tape this?

02:25.999 --> 02:26.998
No, I don't mind.

02:26.999 --> 02:28.998
Great, thank you.

02:28.999 --> 02:30.998
And thank you again for
takingtime out of your rehearsal

02:30.999 --> 02:31.998
to talk to me.

02:31.999 --> 02:33.999
I must tell youwhen I first heard

02:34.999 --> 02:36.998
you were thinkingof coming here,

02:36.999 --> 02:37.998
when you firstcalled me,

02:37.999 --> 02:38.999
I wanted to say...

02:39.999 --> 02:41.998
You just kicked mein the stomach,

02:41.999 --> 02:42.998
why are you doingthis to me?

02:42.999 --> 02:46.998
And then I thought, well, that's stupid

02:46.999 --> 02:48.998
you're not doingthis to me.

02:48.999 --> 02:50.998
And more importantly,

02:50.999 --> 02:53.998
my studentsneed to talk.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.998
When thisfirst happened,

02:55.999 --> 02:58.998
they started to talk about
itand then the media descended

02:58.999 --> 03:00.998
and all dialoguestopped.

03:00.999 --> 03:02.626
We're not reporters.

03:02.999 --> 03:04.199
I know, I read your last play.

03:04.999 --> 03:05.998
You did?

03:05.999 --> 03:06.998
Mm-hmm.

03:06.999 --> 03:09.999
Gave me an ideaof what you do.

03:10.999 --> 03:12.360
Moises called sayinghe had an idea

03:12.999 --> 03:13.998
for his nexttheater project,

03:13.999 --> 03:15.998
but there wasa somberness to his voice.

03:15.999 --> 03:17.998
So, I asked himwhat it was I about.

03:17.999 --> 03:19.998
And he said he maywant to do a piece

03:19.999 --> 03:21.998
about what's happeningin Wyoming.

03:21.999 --> 03:24.998
Lee called me and told methat
the company was thinking

03:24.999 --> 03:27.998
of going down to laramieand
conducting some interviews

03:27.999 --> 03:29.998
and didi want to come?

03:29.999 --> 03:30.998
I did, I said, yeah.

03:30.999 --> 03:31.998
But I...

03:31.999 --> 03:34.998
I was hesitant, because as a gay man,

03:34.999 --> 03:36.998
I mean...

03:36.999 --> 03:40.998
A kid had just been killedthere
because he was gay.

03:40.999 --> 03:42.998
What exactlydo you want?

03:42.999 --> 03:44.999
Well, I'd like youto
give me names of people

03:45.999 --> 03:46.998
who might wantto talk to us.

03:46.999 --> 03:49.998
I'd like to talkto your
studentsand your friends.

03:49.999 --> 03:50.998
I want to hearfrom the people of the town.

03:50.999 --> 03:53.998
I have never doneanything like this before.

03:53.999 --> 03:56.998
How do you get peopleto talk to you?

03:56.999 --> 03:57.998
What do you ask?

03:57.999 --> 04:00.998
It's stillvery raw for us here.

04:00.999 --> 04:01.998
I understand,

04:01.999 --> 04:04.998
but this is no longerabout
laramie or Wyoming.

04:04.999 --> 04:06.999
This is aboutthe whole country.

04:11.999 --> 04:12.999
To me,

04:13.834 --> 04:15.999
it's stillabout laramie.

04:16.999 --> 04:17.998
The company has agreedto come to laramie

04:17.999 --> 04:19.998
and interview the peopleof the town.

04:19.999 --> 04:22.998
And I'm scared 'causei don't
know what I'm gonna do

04:22.999 --> 04:23.998
about tryingto ensure their safety.

04:23.999 --> 04:26.998
I made a preliminarycontact
with Rebecca hilliker

04:26.999 --> 04:28.998
who's the head ofthe theater department

04:28.999 --> 04:29.998
at the universityof Wyoming.

04:29.999 --> 04:32.998
And hopefully that willlead
to more interviews.

04:32.999 --> 04:34.998
You're late.

04:34.999 --> 04:37.999
I know, we talked for a
lotlonger than I planned.

04:38.459 --> 04:39.998
What did Rebecca say?

04:39.999 --> 04:42.998
She gave me names of a bunch
ofpeople who might talk to us.

04:42.999 --> 04:44.998
Townspeople and ranchers, some students.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.998
So, we should try andcontact
these people first.

04:46.999 --> 04:48.998
Let's see if anybody'sgonna talk.

04:48.999 --> 04:50.998
Great.

04:50.999 --> 04:51.998
You okay?

04:51.999 --> 04:52.998
What?

04:52.999 --> 04:54.998
Please don'tdo that here.

04:54.999 --> 04:56.998
Where'reyou folks from?

04:56.999 --> 04:57.998
New York.

04:57.999 --> 04:59.999
And what brings youto town?

05:01.999 --> 05:04.999
We're justpassing through.

05:21.999 --> 05:22.998
Hi.

05:22.999 --> 05:24.998
Is Linda home?

05:24.999 --> 05:25.998
No, she's working.

05:25.999 --> 05:27.998
Okay, well, can you tell
herthat Amanda stopped by

05:27.999 --> 05:29.998
and I'll be atthe ranger motel?

05:29.999 --> 05:30.999
And who are you?

05:31.999 --> 05:32.998
I'm withthe theater company,

05:32.999 --> 05:34.998
Rebecca hillikertold her about me.

05:34.999 --> 05:36.998
I never heard of her, what do you want?

05:36.999 --> 05:37.998
Well, I'm withthe theater company

05:37.999 --> 05:39.998
and we're writing a playabout laramie

05:39.999 --> 05:41.998
and the Matthew shepardincident.

05:41.999 --> 05:42.998
Why are youdoing that?

05:42.999 --> 05:45.998
We think it's a story...

05:45.999 --> 05:46.998
you're sticking your noseinto something

05:46.999 --> 05:48.399
we don't needto talk about anymore.

05:48.626 --> 05:49.667
That's over and done.

05:49.999 --> 05:51.998
I understandyour feeling...

05:51.999 --> 05:53.834
we don't wantanymore of this.

05:53.999 --> 05:54.999
You're not wanted here.

06:00.999 --> 06:02.998
Where are you goingwith this story?

06:02.999 --> 06:04.998
Well, when the playis finished,

06:04.999 --> 06:05.998
we're going to bring itaround to laramie.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.998
And you're gonnause our words?

06:08.999 --> 06:10.125
That's the idea.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.998
Well, I've beenclose enough to the case

06:16.999 --> 06:18.998
to know many ofthe people.

06:18.999 --> 06:21.998
I have a daughter, works
inthe sheriff's department.

06:21.999 --> 06:23.998
As forthe gay issue,

06:23.999 --> 06:26.998
I don't give a damnone way or another

06:26.999 --> 06:27.998
as long asthey don't bother me.

06:27.999 --> 06:30.998
And even if they did, I'd
just say, "no, thank you".

06:30.999 --> 06:33.998
And that's the attitude ofmost
of the laramie population.

06:33.999 --> 06:37.999
They might poke onein a
bar situation, you know?

06:38.999 --> 06:39.998
They've been drinking,

06:39.999 --> 06:41.998
they might actuallysmack one in the mouth,

06:41.999 --> 06:43.998
but thenthey just walk away.

06:43.999 --> 06:46.999
Laramie islive and let live.

06:47.999 --> 06:49.998
My dear brothersand sisters,

06:49.999 --> 06:51.998
I'm here today to bring
youthe word of the lord.

06:51.999 --> 06:54.998
In my ministry, I found a simple truth

06:54.999 --> 06:57.998
that I'd liketo share with you today,

06:57.999 --> 06:58.998
and it's this.

06:58.999 --> 06:59.999
The word

07:00.999 --> 07:02.918
is either sufficient

07:02.999 --> 07:03.998
or it is not.

07:03.999 --> 07:06.998
Now, scientists tell methat human history,

07:06.999 --> 07:10.998
that the worldis five billion

07:10.999 --> 07:13.998
or six billion years old.

07:13.999 --> 07:17.999
After all, what's a billion
yearsgive or take?

07:18.999 --> 07:19.998
But the bibletells me

07:19.999 --> 07:23.998
that human historyis 6,000 years old.

07:23.999 --> 07:24.998
The word

07:24.999 --> 07:28.999
is either sufficientor it is not.

07:30.999 --> 07:31.998
In laramie,

07:31.999 --> 07:33.998
population 26,687,

07:33.999 --> 07:35.998
the first thingto greet us was Walmart.

07:35.999 --> 07:38.998
This could beany main drag in America.

07:38.999 --> 07:40.998
Fast food chains, gas stations.

07:40.999 --> 07:42.998
But as we droveinto the downtown area

07:42.999 --> 07:43.999
by the railroad tracks,

07:44.999 --> 07:45.998
the buildings stillretain the shape

07:45.999 --> 07:47.998
of a turn of a centurywestern town.

07:47.999 --> 07:50.998
Oh, and as we passedthe university inn,

07:50.999 --> 07:54.292
on the sign where amenitiessuch
as heated pool or cable TV

07:54.999 --> 07:55.998
are usually touted,

07:55.999 --> 07:57.999
it said...

08:06.999 --> 08:08.998
So, how did youwind up here?

08:08.999 --> 08:11.998
Well, when it came timeto go to college,

08:11.999 --> 08:14.998
my parents couldn't reallyafford
to send me to college,

08:14.999 --> 08:16.998
so, I knew that I wantedto study theatre,

08:16.999 --> 08:18.998
but I knew that ifi
wanted to go to college,

08:18.999 --> 08:20.998
I had to geton a scholarship.

08:20.999 --> 08:24.998
So, there's this competitionthey
have every year.

08:24.999 --> 08:27.998
It's a Wyoming state high
schoolcompetition thing.

08:27.999 --> 08:28.998
And...

08:28.999 --> 08:31.998
So, I came to the universityto
the theatre department

08:31.999 --> 08:33.998
to look for somegood scenes, right?

08:33.999 --> 08:35.998
And I asked the Professor, I said...

08:35.999 --> 08:38.998
I need a killer sceneand he's like here.

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
Here you go, this is it.

08:41.876 --> 08:41.999
What was it?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.998
That was "angels in America".

08:43.999 --> 08:46.998
I read thatand I'm like, this is okay.

08:46.999 --> 08:49.998
I can win best scene if I justdo
a good enough job, you know?

08:49.999 --> 08:53.998
So, I tell my parents, so they
can see mein the competition.

08:53.999 --> 08:56.998
And they brought me in the
roomand they sat me down.

08:56.999 --> 08:59.998
And they said thatthey
wouldn't come to see me

08:59.999 --> 09:00.998
if I did that scene.

09:00.999 --> 09:01.998
They couldn't.

09:01.999 --> 09:02.998
Why is that?

09:02.999 --> 09:05.998
Because they believeit's wrong,

09:05.999 --> 09:06.998
homosexualityis wrong.

09:06.999 --> 09:10.998
And all I rememberfrom the competition

09:10.999 --> 09:14.999
is juststanding ovation.

09:15.918 --> 09:15.999
Oh, really?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.998
We won, we got first place.

09:18.999 --> 09:21.998
One of the best momentsof my life.

09:21.999 --> 09:23.998
Did your parents come?

09:23.999 --> 09:25.998
Parents weren't there.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.998
Why'd you do it?

09:27.999 --> 09:29.998
Actually, honestly,

09:29.999 --> 09:32.998
I wanted to win.

09:32.999 --> 09:33.998
I really...

09:33.999 --> 09:35.998
And it wasthe greatest scene.

09:35.999 --> 09:37.998
You know, I just wanted...

09:37.999 --> 09:39.999
I just wanted to win.

09:46.999 --> 09:48.998
Today, forthe first time,

09:48.999 --> 09:51.998
I met someone who
actuallyknew Matthew Shepard.

09:51.999 --> 09:53.998
Trish steger, owner of a shop in town,

09:53.999 --> 09:55.998
referred to himas "Matt".

09:55.999 --> 09:59.998
Matt used to come into my
shop, that's how I knew him.

09:59.999 --> 10:02.998
It was the first time I everheard
him referred to as "Matt"

10:02.999 --> 10:03.998
instead of "Matthew".

10:03.999 --> 10:05.998
Well, what was he like?

10:05.999 --> 10:07.998
I don't know, you know?

10:07.999 --> 10:12.999
How does any one personever
tell about another?

10:13.999 --> 10:14.998
Matt wasa blunt little shit.

10:14.999 --> 10:15.998
You knowwhat I'm saying?

10:15.999 --> 10:17.998
He wasa little guy, 5'2".

10:17.999 --> 10:20.998
Soaking wet, I bet you 97 pounds, tops.

10:20.999 --> 10:23.998
They were saying he weighedllo
pounds, I don't believe it.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.998
I said, "are youmatthew Shepard?"

10:25.999 --> 10:27.998
And he says,"yeah, I'm Matthew Shepard,

10:27.999 --> 10:29.998
"but I don't want you tocall
me Matthew or Mr. Shepard.

10:29.999 --> 10:31.998
"Don't call menone of that.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.999
"My name is Matt and I want
youto know that I am gay.

10:35.083 --> 10:37.998
"And we're gonnabe going to a gay bar.

10:37.999 --> 10:39.320
Do you have a problemwith that?"

10:39.999 --> 10:41.998
I said, "no, how you paying?"

10:41.999 --> 10:44.998
The fact ofthe matter is

10:44.999 --> 10:46.998
laramie doesn'thave any gay bars.

10:46.999 --> 10:48.998
Well, for that matter,
neither does Wyoming.

10:48.999 --> 10:51.999
He was hiring me to take himdown
to fort Collins, Colorado.

10:52.792 --> 10:54.998
Which is aboutan hour away.

10:54.999 --> 10:56.998
He was strugglingwhen he first came here,

10:56.999 --> 11:00.999
reaching out, trying to fit in.

11:02.999 --> 11:03.998
I'm sorry I'm late.

11:03.999 --> 11:05.999
Hi, my sister, romaine.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.998
She was a close friendof Matthew's.

11:08.999 --> 11:11.998
Matthew really wantedto get
into political affairs,

11:11.999 --> 11:13.998
that was allhis big interest was.

11:13.999 --> 11:16.998
Watching cnnand msnbc.

11:16.999 --> 11:20.998
Those were the only TV stationsi
ever saw his TV tuned into.

11:20.999 --> 11:22.998
So, why did he moveto laramie?

11:22.999 --> 11:25.998
He told me he was thinkingabout
going back to school.

11:25.999 --> 11:27.998
So, I told him,

11:27.999 --> 11:30.998
"go to the universityof
Wyoming, go to laramie.

11:30.999 --> 11:33.998
You can reallyfind a home there."

11:33.999 --> 11:35.998
I was Matthew'sacademic advisor,

11:35.999 --> 11:38.998
so, I knew him ina very specific context.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.998
But I can tell you thatmatthew was very shy

11:41.999 --> 11:42.999
when he first came in

11:43.999 --> 11:45.998
to the point of being
somewhatmousy, I'd almost say.

11:45.999 --> 11:47.998
But soon, his shyness

11:47.999 --> 11:49.998
began to give wayto this person that

11:49.999 --> 11:53.998
was excited about this trackthat
he was going to embark on.

11:53.999 --> 11:55.998
Whenever I think of
Matthew, I think of his...

11:55.999 --> 11:58.998
Incrediblebeaming smile.

11:58.999 --> 12:02.999
He'd walk into a roomand just be like...

12:03.999 --> 12:05.998
And he'd smileat everyone.

12:05.999 --> 12:07.998
He made you feel great.

12:07.999 --> 12:10.998
He was just starting to say,"there
are opportunities here.

12:10.999 --> 12:13.998
"There are thingsi can do in this world.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.998
I can be important."

12:15.999 --> 12:18.998
I heard from Matt about48
hours before the attack.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.998
And he told mehe just joined

12:21.999 --> 12:23.998
the gay and lesbian groupon campus.

12:23.999 --> 12:25.998
And he wasreally enjoying it,

12:25.999 --> 12:27.998
getting ready forpride week and whatnot.

12:27.999 --> 12:29.998
He was totallystoked about school.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.998
He was reallyhappy being there.

12:32.999 --> 12:35.998
I can only say thisin
retrospect, of course.

12:35.999 --> 12:37.998
I think that'swhere he was headed,

12:37.999 --> 12:40.999
towards human rights.

12:48.999 --> 12:49.998
Let me tell yousomething here.

12:49.999 --> 12:51.998
There's more gay peoplein
Wyoming than meets the eye.

12:51.999 --> 12:52.998
You think?

12:52.999 --> 12:54.998
I know, I know for a fact.

12:54.999 --> 12:59.998
Not particularly, what
do you call the queens,

12:59.999 --> 13:00.998
the gay people?

13:00.999 --> 13:01.999
Queens?

13:02.626 --> 13:03.998
You know, the runaroundfaggot-type people.

13:03.999 --> 13:05.998
I mean, they're morelike the ones who...

13:05.999 --> 13:09.998
Throw a bail of hay, jump ona
horse, brand him and kick ass,

13:09.999 --> 13:11.998
you know whati'm saying?

13:11.999 --> 13:14.998
As I always say, you don'tfuck
with a Wyoming queer

13:14.999 --> 13:16.998
'cause they'll fuckingkick you in your ass.

13:16.999 --> 13:18.999
But that's not the pointof what I'm saying.

13:19.999 --> 13:20.998
What is the point?

13:20.999 --> 13:23.998
The people of wyomingdo not give a damn

13:23.999 --> 13:25.360
one way or the otherif you're gay,

13:25.999 --> 13:26.998
if you're straight, if you're bisexual,

13:26.999 --> 13:28.998
trisexual, doesn't matter.

13:28.999 --> 13:29.998
Really?

13:29.999 --> 13:31.719
That's what I just said, it doesn't matter.

13:31.999 --> 13:34.998
I was the first outlesbian
or gay facility member.

13:34.999 --> 13:36.998
And that's in 1992,

13:36.999 --> 13:39.998
so, that's notthat long ago.

13:39.999 --> 13:42.998
They asked me at the
interviewwhat my husband did.

13:42.999 --> 13:43.999
So, I came out then.

13:44.999 --> 13:46.998
When I firstmoved out here,

13:46.999 --> 13:48.998
I knew it was gonnabe hard as a gay man.

13:48.999 --> 13:51.998
And there would be timesi
would go down to Denver

13:51.999 --> 13:53.999
and I would goto the gay bars there.

13:54.999 --> 13:56.998
And people would ask mewhere I was from

13:56.999 --> 13:58.998
I would saylaramie, Wyoming.

13:58.999 --> 14:02.998
And I met so many men down there

14:02.999 --> 14:04.998
from Wyoming.

14:04.999 --> 14:06.998
So many gay menwho grew up here

14:06.999 --> 14:09.998
and they are like, "this is
nota place where I can live,

14:09.999 --> 14:11.998
how can you live there, I had to get out."

14:11.999 --> 14:12.998
Rah, rah, rah...

14:12.999 --> 14:15.998
But every once in a
while, there'd be a guy,

14:15.999 --> 14:17.999
"oh gosh, I miss laramie.

14:18.999 --> 14:20.998
"I mean, I really love it there.

14:20.999 --> 14:22.998
That's wherei want to live."

14:22.999 --> 14:25.998
They get thisstarry-eyed look

14:25.999 --> 14:28.998
and I think, if that
iswhere you want to live,

14:28.999 --> 14:30.998
do it.

14:30.999 --> 14:32.998
So, I get intomy office one day

14:32.999 --> 14:34.998
and I have a messageto
call this woman back,

14:34.999 --> 14:35.998
so, I call her back.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.998
And she goes,"I hear you are a lesbian.

14:37.999 --> 14:39.998
I hear you are one."

14:39.999 --> 14:41.998
And I'm like, "uh-huh."

14:41.999 --> 14:43.998
She goes, "I'm one too."

14:43.999 --> 14:45.998
She wanted to come overand
meet me immediately.

14:45.999 --> 14:47.998
She also warned meabout the fact

14:47.999 --> 14:49.998
that there's other lesbiansin this town

14:49.999 --> 14:52.998
who would notbe seen with me,

14:52.999 --> 14:55.998
that just to be seen with
mewould take them irreparably.

14:55.999 --> 15:00.999
That just to be seen with
mewould be a big problem.

15:02.999 --> 15:04.998
I love this land.

15:04.999 --> 15:05.998
I mean,

15:05.999 --> 15:09.999
I reallylove this land.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.998
Okay, I'm gonnamake this brief, quick.

15:26.999 --> 15:28.998
Just get itover with.

15:28.999 --> 15:30.998
But it will be everything,
factual, just the facts.

15:30.999 --> 15:33.998
10:00, I punch in, my
regular time for Tuesdays.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.998
10:30, we're havingkaraoke
night that night,

15:35.999 --> 15:38.160
so, there's maybe 20, 30
peoplemilling around in here.

15:38.209 --> 15:40.998
That's when Matthew shepardcomes in alone.

15:40.999 --> 15:41.999
He comes in and...

15:42.999 --> 15:45.998
He actually sits right
whereyou're sitting right now.

15:45.999 --> 15:47.998
Orders himselfa Heineken.

15:47.999 --> 15:49.399
So, what can I tell youabout Matt?

15:49.999 --> 15:53.998
Manners, politenessintelligence,

15:53.999 --> 15:55.199
taking care of me, as in tips.

15:55.999 --> 15:57.998
Everything, just offers conversation.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.998
He comes in, he's alwaysdressed
real nice, clean cut.

15:59.999 --> 16:01.998
Didn't seemto have any worries.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.998
It wasn't likehe was waiting on anybody.

16:03.999 --> 16:06.999
He just wantedto enjoy his
drinkand the company around.

16:12.999 --> 16:15.998
I guess it was maybe
11:30,11:45, that's when...

16:15.999 --> 16:18.998
Russell hendersonand
Aaron mckinney came in.

16:18.999 --> 16:21.998
They come in, they approach
the bar, they sit right here.

16:21.999 --> 16:23.998
They order a pitcherand as you know,

16:23.999 --> 16:26.998
they pay for the thingentirely
in dimes and quarters,

16:26.999 --> 16:29.998
which, let me tell you, is
something you justdon't forget.

16:29.999 --> 16:31.439
You don't forgetsomething like that.

16:31.999 --> 16:32.998
$5.50 in dimesand quarters

16:32.999 --> 16:34.998
is a freakin' nightmarefor a bartender.

16:34.999 --> 16:36.998
Money meantnothing to Matthew,

16:36.999 --> 16:38.998
'cause he grew upwith a lot of it.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.998
And he'd have handed
overhis wallet in a second

16:40.999 --> 16:42.998
because moneymeant nothing to him.

16:42.999 --> 16:45.167
His shoes might'vemeant something, but...

16:45.999 --> 16:47.998
They can say it was
robberyall they want to,

16:47.999 --> 16:51.998
but I don't buy it, not
evenfor an iota of a second.

16:51.999 --> 16:53.998
Look, when they came in,

16:53.999 --> 16:56.998
Henderson and mckinney to me,
they didn't seem to be...

16:56.999 --> 16:58.998
They weren'tintoxificated at all.

16:58.999 --> 17:01.998
They came right in, they
ordered a pitcher of beer,

17:01.999 --> 17:02.998
take it back thereinto the pool area

17:02.999 --> 17:05.999
and they pretty muchjust
kept to themselves.

17:07.999 --> 17:08.998
Probably going onfor about a half an hour.

17:08.999 --> 17:10.998
And then, I noticedthat Russell and Aaron

17:10.999 --> 17:12.998
had been talkingwith Matthew Shepard.

17:12.999 --> 17:15.998
Some people are sayinghe
made a pass at them.

17:15.999 --> 17:20.998
Well, hell, you don'tpick
up regular people.

17:20.999 --> 17:24.998
Aaron and I have
beentogether for two years.

17:24.999 --> 17:28.584
And Aaron said that a guy walkedup
to him and said he was gay

17:28.999 --> 17:30.998
and wanted to getwith him and Russ.

17:30.999 --> 17:32.998
And Aaron's reallybad about that.

17:32.999 --> 17:34.998
He doesn't like to
bearound gay people at all

17:34.999 --> 17:35.998
and neither does Russ.

17:35.999 --> 17:37.998
They justdon't like them.

17:37.999 --> 17:38.998
At all.

17:38.999 --> 17:40.998
And so, he gotaggravated with it.

17:40.999 --> 17:42.998
And said thathe was straight

17:42.999 --> 17:43.998
and he didn't want to
haveanything to do with it

17:43.999 --> 17:45.998
and he walked off.

17:45.999 --> 17:49.998
And he said that's when himand
Russ went into the bathroom

17:49.999 --> 17:51.998
and decided to pretendthat they were gay

17:51.999 --> 17:53.998
and get him in the truckand rob him.

17:53.999 --> 17:55.998
They wantedto teach him a lesson

17:55.999 --> 17:58.998
not to come onto straight people.

17:58.999 --> 18:00.998
I'm not excusingtheir actions,

18:00.999 --> 18:03.998
but it seemsto be partially his fault

18:03.999 --> 18:05.998
and partiallythe guys who did it.

18:05.999 --> 18:07.792
So, you know...

18:07.999 --> 18:09.998
Maybe it's 50/50.

18:09.999 --> 18:11.998
They stated that mattcame on to them.

18:11.999 --> 18:12.998
That he approached them.

18:12.999 --> 18:15.998
I absolutely positivelydisbelieve

18:15.999 --> 18:17.998
and refutethat statement 100%.

18:17.999 --> 18:18.998
I'll give youtwo reasons why.

18:18.999 --> 18:20.998
One... Character reference.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.998
Why wouldhe approach them? Why them?

18:22.999 --> 18:23.998
I mean, he wasn't approachinganyone
else in the bar, okay?

18:23.999 --> 18:26.998
So, I mean, they say he's gay,
that he was a flaming gay.

18:26.999 --> 18:28.998
So, he was justgonna come on to people.

18:28.999 --> 18:29.998
Bullshit, he nevercame on to me.

18:29.999 --> 18:31.998
I mean, hello, c'mon!

18:31.999 --> 18:32.998
He's gonna approachthese two guys? Please.

18:32.999 --> 18:34.998
And, two...

18:34.999 --> 18:35.998
Territorialism.

18:35.999 --> 18:37.998
Matt wassitting there.

18:37.999 --> 18:39.998
Aaron and russellwere back there.

18:39.999 --> 18:42.998
Upon their first interaction,
they were in Matt's area.

18:42.999 --> 18:45.998
The area that he had been
seensitting in all night long.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.998
So, who approached whoby that?

18:47.999 --> 18:50.999
He'd never not talkto
someone for any reason.

18:51.999 --> 18:52.998
If someone startedtalking to him,

18:52.999 --> 18:55.042
he'd just be like, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

18:55.999 --> 18:57.998
He had no problem

18:57.999 --> 18:59.998
just striking upa
conversation with anybody.

18:59.999 --> 19:01.998
So, this is whati'm gonna be testifying to

19:01.999 --> 19:04.998
'cause basically I'm like, the
key eyewitness in the case.

19:04.999 --> 19:06.998
Basically, I'm gonnabe testifying

19:06.999 --> 19:08.998
that I sawmatthew leave.

19:08.999 --> 19:11.998
I saw two individualsleave
with Matthew Shepard.

19:11.999 --> 19:12.998
And I didn'tsee their faces,

19:12.999 --> 19:13.998
but I did seethe back of their heads.

19:13.999 --> 19:15.998
And at the same time,

19:15.999 --> 19:16.998
mckinney and hendersonare no longer around.

19:16.999 --> 19:18.999
So, you do the math.

20:05.999 --> 20:06.998
I'm not super familiarwith that area

20:06.999 --> 20:11.998
which now makes me thinkthat God wanted me

20:11.999 --> 20:15.998
to find him.

20:15.999 --> 20:17.998
I was going for a rideon my bike

20:17.999 --> 20:19.998
and I noticed something...

20:19.999 --> 20:21.998
Just laying there,

20:21.999 --> 20:22.999
by the fence.

20:23.999 --> 20:28.998
Now, I thinkit's a scarecrow.

20:28.999 --> 20:30.998
I'm like, halloween's coming up.

20:30.999 --> 20:31.998
I think it's a...

20:31.999 --> 20:33.998
Halloween gag.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.999
I noticed his chestmoving up and down,

20:37.125 --> 20:40.998
still thoughtit was a dummy.

20:40.999 --> 20:43.999
I thought it wassome kind of mechanism.

20:45.999 --> 20:47.999
But when I...

20:49.999 --> 20:51.999
When I saw hair...

20:52.999 --> 20:54.999
His hair...

20:56.999 --> 20:59.999
...I knew it wasa human being.

21:01.999 --> 21:02.998
So, what'd you do?

21:02.999 --> 21:05.999
I ran to the nearest house,
I ran as fast as I could,

21:06.999 --> 21:07.999
and called the police.

21:09.999 --> 21:10.998
...county sheriff's
departmentheld a news conference

21:10.999 --> 21:11.998
late this afternoon.

21:11.999 --> 21:14.998
They say they're investigatingthe
attempted murder

21:14.999 --> 21:16.998
of 22-year-oldmatthew Shepard.

21:16.999 --> 21:18.998
The sheriff said deputiesfound
the man badly beaten

21:18.999 --> 21:21.999
and unconscious, tied to
a fence last night...

21:23.999 --> 21:26.998
...brutal attack leftmatthew
Shepard in a coma.

21:26.999 --> 21:30.998
...said he first thoughtmr.
Shepard was a scarecrow.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.998
...In jail nowcharged with the crime,

21:32.999 --> 21:35.998
21-year-old Russell hendersonand
Aaron mckinney, kidnapping.

21:35.999 --> 21:39.998
And the victim, Matthew Shepard,
is in very critical condition

21:39.999 --> 21:42.999
at this hour atpoudre valley hospital.

21:47.999 --> 21:50.998
The arraignment took placeon
Friday around lunchtime.

21:50.999 --> 21:53.998
And more details aboutthe case had come out

21:53.999 --> 21:55.998
like the fact thatthe
perpetrators themselves

21:55.999 --> 21:57.998
were kids.

21:57.999 --> 21:59.998
Kids, local kids,

21:59.999 --> 22:01.998
that everyonewho's from around here

22:01.999 --> 22:03.918
has somerelationship to.

22:09.999 --> 22:11.998
So, then a judge comes inand
does a reading of the facts.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.999
The defendants,

22:14.999 --> 22:15.998
Aaron James mckinney,

22:15.999 --> 22:17.998
Russell Arthur Henderson,

22:17.999 --> 22:20.998
met Matthew shepardat the fireside bar.

22:20.999 --> 22:23.998
And after Mr. Shepardconfided he was gay,

22:23.999 --> 22:25.998
the subjects deceivedmr. Shepard

22:25.999 --> 22:29.998
into leaving with them intheir
vehicle to a remote area.

22:29.999 --> 22:32.998
Enroute to said location,

22:32.999 --> 22:35.998
Mr. Shepard was struckin
the head with a pistol.

22:35.999 --> 22:37.998
And upon arrivalat said area,

22:37.999 --> 22:41.998
both subjects tied their
victimto a buck fence,

22:41.999 --> 22:43.998
robbed him, tortured him,

22:43.999 --> 22:46.998
and continued to beatand terrorize him.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.998
When I gotto the fence,

22:49.999 --> 22:52.998
I seen what appearedto be a young man.

22:52.999 --> 22:55.998
13, 14, years of age

22:55.999 --> 22:57.998
because he wasso tiny laying there

22:57.999 --> 23:00.998
and he was boundto the bottom of the pole.

23:00.999 --> 23:03.999
What did you do?

23:04.667 --> 23:05.998
I did the besti could.

23:05.999 --> 23:07.999
He was covered in dry
bloodall over his head

23:08.999 --> 23:09.998
and the only place
thatthere wasn't any blood

23:09.999 --> 23:14.998
was what appeared to bewhere he
had been cryingdown his face.

23:14.999 --> 23:17.998
You know, he...

23:17.999 --> 23:19.998
He did not look normal.

23:19.999 --> 23:23.998
I could tell that he hada
very harsh head wound.

23:23.999 --> 23:25.998
You expect thesekinds of injuries

23:25.999 --> 23:27.998
from somebodycrashing down a hill

23:27.999 --> 23:29.998
in a car at80 Miles an hour.

23:29.999 --> 23:32.998
You expect to see gross
injuriesfrom something like that.

23:32.999 --> 23:34.999
This is a horrendous, terrible thing.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.998
But you don't expectto
see someone doing this

23:38.999 --> 23:39.998
to another person.

23:39.999 --> 23:42.998
Both defendants were
latercontacted by officers

23:42.999 --> 23:44.998
from the laramiepolice department

23:44.999 --> 23:46.998
who observed insidethe cab of their pick-up

23:46.999 --> 23:47.999
a credit card

23:48.999 --> 23:49.998
and a pair ofblack patent-leather shoes

23:49.999 --> 23:52.998
belonging to the victim, matthew Shepard.

23:52.999 --> 23:53.998
The thing thatshocked me is...

23:53.999 --> 23:55.999
It was a pristinecrime scene.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.998
How do you mean?

23:57.999 --> 23:59.998
The tire tracks,

23:59.999 --> 24:00.998
the impressions thatthe tire made.

24:00.999 --> 24:03.998
They were just perfectbecause
of the Sandy soil there.

24:03.999 --> 24:05.998
And we founda carpet fragment

24:05.999 --> 24:06.998
from inside the truck

24:06.999 --> 24:08.998
and that will always
shock meuntil this day.

24:08.999 --> 24:10.999
Southeast from Wyoming, the
wind here is so strong

24:11.709 --> 24:13.550
that you usually neverfind
something like that

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
in an exteriorcrime scene.

24:17.999 --> 24:18.998
His hands were...

24:18.999 --> 24:20.998
Thumbs out, what we
callthe cuffing position.

24:20.999 --> 24:21.998
It's howwe handcuff people.

24:21.999 --> 24:24.998
He was tied witha real thin, white rope.

24:24.999 --> 24:27.998
And it was wound aroundthe
bottom of the pole

24:27.999 --> 24:30.999
about four inchesup off the ground.

24:32.999 --> 24:33.998
His shoeswere missing.

24:33.999 --> 24:36.998
He was tiedextremely tight,

24:36.999 --> 24:38.998
so, I used my boot knifeand
I tried to slip it in there

24:38.999 --> 24:40.999
between the ropeand his wrist.

24:42.999 --> 24:44.998
I had to beextremely careful

24:44.999 --> 24:48.998
so as not to harmmatthew any further.

24:48.999 --> 24:50.998
I was yelling at himat the top of my lungs,

24:50.999 --> 24:51.998
"hey, wake up!

24:51.999 --> 24:52.998
Something.

24:52.999 --> 24:54.998
Just trying to getanything out of him.

24:54.999 --> 24:56.998
He didn't move, he didn't flinch,

24:56.999 --> 24:57.998
he didn't anything.

24:57.999 --> 25:00.998
We rolled him overonto his left side

25:00.999 --> 25:02.998
and when we did that, he stopped breathing.

25:02.999 --> 25:04.998
So, I immediatelygot him back on his back.

25:04.999 --> 25:07.998
And that was justenough of an adjustment.

25:07.999 --> 25:11.998
It gave me just enough roomfor
me to slip my knife in there

25:11.999 --> 25:13.998
and to cut him free.

25:13.999 --> 25:15.998
And then robdrove the ambulance

25:15.999 --> 25:19.751
to ivinson hospital'semergency room.

25:19.999 --> 25:20.998
Once we saw Matthew,

25:20.999 --> 25:22.279
it was very obviousthat his care

25:22.876 --> 25:23.998
was beyondour capabilities.

25:23.999 --> 25:27.999
Phoned the neurosurgeonover
at poudre valley...

25:28.999 --> 25:30.998
And matthewwas on his way

25:30.999 --> 25:34.998
in an hourand 15 minutes I think.

25:34.999 --> 25:38.999
A couple days later, they
showed mea picture of Matthew.

25:39.999 --> 25:42.999
I would've neverrecognized him.

25:45.459 --> 25:47.998
Said defendantsleft the victim

25:47.999 --> 25:49.998
tied to the fence

25:49.999 --> 25:52.999
begging for his life.

25:55.999 --> 25:57.998
Certainly you'd like to
thinkthat this is somebody

25:57.999 --> 25:59.998
from out of town who's comethrough
and beaten up somebody.

25:59.999 --> 26:03.998
But when you're seeing
someonewho's been beaten...

26:03.999 --> 26:07.998
Repeatedly by someonein our own town...

26:07.999 --> 26:10.998
Now, that certainlyoffends us.

26:10.999 --> 26:11.999
And that's a good word

26:12.999 --> 26:14.998
it offends us.

26:14.999 --> 26:16.998
The defendants willremain in the custody

26:16.999 --> 26:18.998
of the Albany countysheriff's department

26:18.999 --> 26:21.999
until dates can be setfor their trials.

26:43.999 --> 26:44.998
It was huge.

26:44.999 --> 26:45.998
Yeah, it was herds.

26:45.999 --> 26:47.998
And we are talkinghundreds of reporters

26:47.999 --> 26:49.998
which makes a huge dentin
this town's population.

26:49.999 --> 26:51.998
Laramie, Wyoming,

26:51.999 --> 26:53.998
often called "the gem city of the plains",

26:53.999 --> 26:54.998
is now at theeye of the storm.

26:54.999 --> 26:56.998
People would liketo think that

26:56.999 --> 26:58.998
what happened to Matthew
shepardis the exception...

26:58.999 --> 27:00.792
There werereporters everywhere,

27:00.999 --> 27:01.998
news truckseverywhere in town,

27:01.999 --> 27:02.999
everywhere on campus.

27:03.999 --> 27:05.998
And we are not used
tothat type of attention.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.998
Aaron mckinney and his
friend, russell Henderson,

27:07.999 --> 27:09.998
came from the poorside of town.

27:09.999 --> 27:12.998
This small city that buildsitself
as Wyoming's hometown

27:12.999 --> 27:15.998
is wrestling withits
attitudes towards gay men.

27:15.999 --> 27:17.998
It's a tough businessmatt Shepard knew,

27:17.999 --> 27:21.998
and as all his friends know,
to be gay in cowboy country.

27:21.999 --> 27:24.998
And to get that kind of exposureunder
such tragic circumstances,

27:24.999 --> 27:26.998
under circumstancesthat we hadn't even

27:26.999 --> 27:30.999
wrapped our own headsand hearts around.

27:32.999 --> 27:33.998
The majority of peoplehere are good people.

27:33.999 --> 27:35.360
You get bad applesonce in a while.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.998
Our citizens are notlike that at all.

27:37.999 --> 27:39.998
You people aremaking my son guilty

27:39.999 --> 27:40.998
before he's evenhad a trial.

27:40.999 --> 27:42.998
How can this happen?

27:42.999 --> 27:45.998
I can't understand how someonecan
even do something like that.

27:45.999 --> 27:48.998
You have your own lifestyle, you
should have your lifestyle.

27:48.999 --> 27:50.998
It's pretty muchlive and let live.

27:50.999 --> 27:51.998
It's live and let live.

27:51.999 --> 27:53.998
I am outragedand sickened

27:53.999 --> 27:55.998
by the heinous crimecommitted
on Matthew Shepard.

27:55.999 --> 27:58.998
The young gay manis in a deep coma.

27:58.999 --> 28:00.998
It's a crime thatgoes beyond despicable.

28:00.999 --> 28:02.998
Just let it be knownthroughout the nation,

28:02.999 --> 28:04.479
this is notthe university of Wyoming.

28:04.999 --> 28:05.998
This is notwhat we're about.

28:05.999 --> 28:06.998
Had this beena heterosexual,

28:06.999 --> 28:08.998
this never would'vemade the national news.

28:08.999 --> 28:09.998
I don't thinkthere's any problem

28:09.999 --> 28:11.998
that gay peopledeal with here.

28:11.999 --> 28:13.998
We had these guys in
jailin less than a day.

28:13.999 --> 28:15.998
I think that'spretty damn good.

28:15.999 --> 28:17.998
Hundreds of peopleare urging congress

28:17.999 --> 28:19.998
to pass a federal law...

28:19.999 --> 28:21.999
I would like to urgethe people of Wyoming

28:22.999 --> 28:24.998
against overreactingin a way that

28:24.999 --> 28:26.998
gives one groupspecial rights over others.

28:26.999 --> 28:28.998
We will wait and see ifthe
vicious beating and torture

28:28.999 --> 28:32.999
of Matthew shepardwas motivated by hate.

28:34.999 --> 28:37.999
Oh, my God.

28:39.999 --> 28:42.999
Anybody elsewant to do this?

28:52.999 --> 28:55.999
Matthew Shepard was
admittedin critical condition

28:56.999 --> 29:00.998
at approximately 9:15on October 7.

29:00.999 --> 29:03.998
When he arrivedhe was unresponsive

29:03.999 --> 29:06.998
and breathing supportwas being provided.

29:06.999 --> 29:10.998
Matthew's major injuriesupon
arrival consisted of

29:10.999 --> 29:14.998
hypothermia and of a
fracturefrom behind his head,

29:14.999 --> 29:17.998
to just in frontof the right ear.

29:17.999 --> 29:21.998
This has causedbleeding in the brain

29:21.999 --> 29:24.998
as well as pressureon the brain.

29:24.999 --> 29:26.998
Friday night, the parents arrived

29:26.999 --> 29:29.998
and I went upand introduced
myselfto Dennis and Judy

29:29.999 --> 29:33.998
and it was awful, those poor people.

29:33.999 --> 29:36.998
Matthew's temperaturehas fluctuated

29:36.999 --> 29:38.998
over the last 24 hours

29:38.999 --> 29:41.999
between 98and 106 degrees.

29:42.999 --> 29:44.998
We arranged a police
escortto bring them up.

29:44.999 --> 29:47.998
Set them up in one ofour conference rooms,

29:47.999 --> 29:50.319
gave them food around the clock,
gave them a place to stay.

29:50.918 --> 29:53.998
The following isa statement from them.

29:53.999 --> 29:55.999
"First of all, we want to
thankthe American public

29:56.999 --> 29:58.999
"for their kind thoughtsabout Matthew

29:59.999 --> 30:01.998
"and their fond wishesfor
his speedy recovery.

30:01.999 --> 30:04.998
"We appreciate your prayersand goodwill

30:04.999 --> 30:05.998
"and we know that

30:05.999 --> 30:09.998
they are something thatmatthew
would appreciate too."

30:09.999 --> 30:11.999
I went up and said...

30:12.999 --> 30:15.998
You all tell mewhat you want me to do

30:15.999 --> 30:18.998
or what you want me to
sayor anything you need

30:18.999 --> 30:20.998
and we'll provide itfor you.

30:20.999 --> 30:24.998
"We also have a special
requestfor members of the media.

30:24.999 --> 30:28.998
"We ask that you respect
ourprivacy as well as Matthew's,

30:28.999 --> 30:30.998
"so, we can concentrateall of our efforts,

30:30.999 --> 30:34.998
"thoughts, and loveon our son.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.999
Thank you very much."

30:39.999 --> 30:41.998
Russell hendersonand Aaron mckinney

30:41.999 --> 30:43.998
have plead not guiltyto the charges

30:43.999 --> 30:45.998
of kidnapping, aggravated robbery,

30:45.999 --> 30:47.998
and attempted murderin the first degree.

30:47.999 --> 30:49.998
Russell wasjust so sweet.

30:49.999 --> 30:51.999
He's the one that wasthe eagle scout.

30:52.999 --> 30:54.998
His whole presencewas just

30:54.999 --> 30:55.998
quiet and sweet.

30:55.999 --> 30:57.998
He was raised a mormon.

30:57.999 --> 30:58.998
He was real active in
thatwhen he was younger.

30:58.999 --> 31:00.998
He was an elderin the church.

31:00.999 --> 31:02.998
So, of course, it doesn'tmake
any sense to me.

31:02.999 --> 31:03.998
I know people snapand whatever.

31:03.999 --> 31:06.998
Like I said, it wasn'ta
real intimate relationship.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.998
I was justhis landlord.

31:08.999 --> 31:10.998
I remember like, at the Christmas party

31:10.999 --> 31:12.998
he was just totally drunkout of his mind,

31:12.999 --> 31:13.998
you know, like, we all were.

31:13.999 --> 31:16.998
But he wasn't belligerent.

31:16.999 --> 31:18.998
He didn't change, his
personality didn't change.

31:18.999 --> 31:20.998
He was still the samelittle meek...

31:20.999 --> 31:21.999
Russell.

31:22.999 --> 31:23.998
Aaron was a good kid.

31:23.999 --> 31:25.998
That's why I was shockedwhen I heard this.

31:25.999 --> 31:27.998
See, he had beenliving with this girl.

31:27.999 --> 31:29.998
They just starteddating last summer.

31:29.999 --> 31:31.998
She must've gotten pregnantas
soon as they started dating

31:31.999 --> 31:33.998
'cause you knowthey had a kid?

31:33.999 --> 31:35.998
21 years old, buthe's
running around with a kid.

31:35.999 --> 31:37.998
When I firstheard about,

31:37.999 --> 31:39.998
I thought it wasreally, really awful.

31:39.999 --> 31:40.998
I don't know whetheraaron was fucked up

31:40.999 --> 31:42.998
or was coming downor what.

31:42.999 --> 31:44.998
But Matthew had money.

31:44.999 --> 31:46.998
Shit, he had betterclothes than I did.

31:46.999 --> 31:48.292
Matthew was a littlerich bitch.

31:48.999 --> 31:51.998
Shouldn't call him a rich bitch,
though, that's not right.

31:51.999 --> 31:52.998
I'm not sayinghe was a bad guy either,

31:52.999 --> 31:54.600
I'm just sayinghe was at the wrong place

31:54.999 --> 31:56.600
at the wrong time, said the wrong things.

31:56.626 --> 31:58.998
Aaron was alwaysdressing up big.

31:58.999 --> 31:59.999
Big clothes.

32:00.999 --> 32:02.998
Tommy hilfiger.

32:02.999 --> 32:05.998
Polo, Gucci, I don't know.

32:05.999 --> 32:08.998
I mean, it probablypissed
him offthat Matthew was gay

32:08.999 --> 32:10.998
'causehe didn't like...

32:10.999 --> 32:13.998
I mean, the gay people thati've
seen him interact with

32:13.999 --> 32:15.320
or that I've heardhim talk about,

32:15.999 --> 32:16.998
he was fine with

32:16.999 --> 32:18.998
as long as, you know,
they didn't hit on him.

32:18.999 --> 32:23.999
Or as long as, you know, it didn't come up.

32:24.999 --> 32:25.998
When I knew him, when I knew Aaron,

32:25.999 --> 32:27.998
he was justa young kid.

32:27.999 --> 32:29.998
He's trying to fit inacting
tough, acting cool.

32:29.999 --> 32:30.998
But you know what?

32:30.999 --> 32:32.998
You can get in his faceabout it...

32:32.999 --> 32:34.999
He'd back down likehe's
some kind of scared kid.

32:35.999 --> 32:37.959
If I saw aaronright now,

32:37.999 --> 32:40.998
I'd be like, why'd you fuck up like that?

32:40.999 --> 32:42.998
I want to shake him, you know?

32:42.999 --> 32:44.998
What wereyou thinking?!

32:44.999 --> 32:47.999
What in the hellwere you thinking?

32:53.999 --> 32:55.998
Hello?

32:55.999 --> 32:56.998
This is her.

32:56.999 --> 32:58.999
Oh, hi, doctor.

32:59.999 --> 33:01.999
How is he?

33:05.999 --> 33:07.792
Yes.

33:08.999 --> 33:09.999
I see.

33:10.918 --> 33:12.998
Can you hang onfor a moment?

33:12.999 --> 33:16.999
Mom, can you hang this up,
I'm gonna take it in there.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.999
I'm here.

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
The part I wasn'ttelling you about before.

33:27.999 --> 33:30.998
Is that Reggie flutyis my daughter.

33:30.999 --> 33:34.501
When she told me she wantedto
be a police officer,

33:34.999 --> 33:36.998
I thought there wasnot a
better choice for her.

33:36.999 --> 33:39.998
She could handlewhatever came her way.

33:39.999 --> 33:43.999
And then this happens.

33:48.999 --> 33:51.999
That was the hospital.

33:54.999 --> 33:57.998
Matthew shepardis HIV positive

33:57.999 --> 34:02.999
and they saidi've been exposed.

34:03.999 --> 34:04.999
What?

34:08.998 --> 34:11.998
They said I've beenexposed
to the aids virus.

34:12.998 --> 34:14.998
You know, becausei've been building

34:14.998 --> 34:16.998
the lean-tosfor the llamas

34:16.998 --> 34:20.998
and I have a bunch ofopen
cuts on my hands and I...

34:21.998 --> 34:24.998
I got his bloodon my hands.

34:24.998 --> 34:27.998
How did you get iton your hands?

34:27.998 --> 34:29.998
We have shit gloves, you know?

34:29.998 --> 34:32.998
And I kept putting them onand
you keep putting them on

34:33.167 --> 34:34.998
and they keepbreaking, so...

34:34.998 --> 34:38.998
So, finally I ran out.

34:39.998 --> 34:41.998
So, you touched himwithout gloves?

34:43.998 --> 34:45.998
You cannot let a human beingjust sit there.

34:45.998 --> 34:46.998
Reggie!

34:46.998 --> 34:48.998
Don't hesitate.

34:48.998 --> 34:49.998
That's what goesthrough your mind.

34:49.998 --> 34:51.998
Don't hesitate, all the time.

34:51.998 --> 34:55.998
So, you just keep on movingand
you take care of Matthew

34:55.998 --> 34:57.998
and you tryto find an open airway.

34:57.999 --> 34:58.998
And that'swhat you do.

34:58.999 --> 35:00.998
You know, that's what you do!

35:00.999 --> 35:04.999
Quite frankly, I wantedto
lash out at somebody.

35:06.999 --> 35:08.199
Not Matthew, please understand

35:08.999 --> 35:10.998
that not one of uswas mad at Matthew.

35:10.999 --> 35:13.999
We maybe wanted to
squeezemckinney's head off.

35:14.501 --> 35:16.998
And I thinkabout Henderson.

35:16.999 --> 35:19.998
You know, two absolutely...

35:19.999 --> 35:24.998
Human beings caused so
muchgrief for so many people.

35:24.999 --> 35:29.998
They want to start me onthese
atz drugs immediately

35:29.999 --> 35:30.998
and if you...

35:30.999 --> 35:33.998
If you start themwithin 36 hours,

35:33.999 --> 35:37.999
maybe that can stop youfrom
getting the disease.

35:39.999 --> 35:41.999
This has been just
terriblefor my whole family,

35:42.292 --> 35:44.998
but mostly for herand her kids.

35:44.999 --> 35:45.998
Those drugs,

35:45.999 --> 35:47.998
the azt drugs.

35:47.999 --> 35:50.998
She throws upevery day.

35:50.999 --> 35:54.999
She cries so much, she's
afraid to touch her kids.

35:55.999 --> 35:58.999
I just hope she doesn'tgo before me.

36:22.999 --> 36:24.998
No matter how you dice it, I
did have the opportunity.

36:24.999 --> 36:28.999
If I had had amazing20/20 hindsight,

36:29.999 --> 36:30.998
I had the opportunityto stop

36:30.999 --> 36:32.998
what occurred that night.

36:32.999 --> 36:34.998
I could've stopped it.

36:34.999 --> 36:35.998
I should've known.

36:35.999 --> 36:38.039
These guys should not have
beentalking to that guy.

36:38.999 --> 36:40.998
I should've not had my head
downwhile I was washing dishes

36:40.999 --> 36:41.998
for those 20 seconds.

36:41.999 --> 36:42.999
All those little thingsi could've done

36:43.042 --> 36:44.998
and I could'vestopped this.

36:44.999 --> 36:48.999
So, what the hellwas I thinking?

36:53.999 --> 36:55.998
I keep seeing thatpicture in my head

36:55.999 --> 36:56.999
of when I found him.

36:57.999 --> 37:00.998
And it is notpleasant whatsoever.

37:00.999 --> 37:02.998
I want to like, get it out.

37:02.999 --> 37:05.999
I don't want itin there.

37:06.999 --> 37:08.360
And that's a bigpart of it for me,

37:08.999 --> 37:10.999
is havingto see that picture...

37:11.999 --> 37:12.998
In my head.

37:12.999 --> 37:15.999
I just, I don'twant it in there.

37:17.999 --> 37:21.999
Matthew Shepard's the
firstgay person I ever saw.

37:22.999 --> 37:23.998
It's kind ofunbelievable to me

37:23.999 --> 37:26.998
that I happened to bethe
person that found him.

37:26.999 --> 37:30.999
Because like, the big
questionwith my religion is...

37:31.999 --> 37:34.999
...why did godwant me to find him?

37:39.999 --> 37:42.998
* in the darkness

37:42.999 --> 37:46.998
* before the dawn

37:46.999 --> 37:51.998
* no more sorrow

37:51.999 --> 37:56.998
* in the nighttime

37:56.999 --> 37:59.998
* let it shine

37:59.999 --> 38:03.998
* oh, lord, let it shine *

38:03.999 --> 38:06.998
Candlelight vigils were heldaround
the country last night...

38:06.999 --> 38:08.998
There are expressionsof sympathy...

38:08.999 --> 38:12.998
...Denver, Detroit, chicago, Washington...

38:12.999 --> 38:16.998
Atlanta, Nashville, Minneapolis,
and around the world.

38:16.999 --> 38:19.998
...all expressing hopesfor
Matthew's recovery.

38:19.999 --> 38:21.998
I can'tstop crying.

38:21.999 --> 38:24.998
This is whati was trying to stop.

38:24.999 --> 38:27.209
We must do more

38:27.999 --> 38:28.998
to deal

38:28.999 --> 38:30.998
with violent bigotry,

38:30.999 --> 38:32.998
hate crimes...

38:32.999 --> 38:34.998
I hope that inthe grief of this moment

38:34.999 --> 38:36.998
and in the shared outrageacross America,

38:36.999 --> 38:39.998
Americans will once
againsearch their hearts

38:39.999 --> 38:44.998
and do what they can to
reducetheir own fear and anxiety

38:44.999 --> 38:47.998
and anger at peoplewho are different.

38:47.999 --> 38:50.998
And I hope thatcongress will pass

38:50.999 --> 38:53.998
the hate-crimeslegislation.

38:53.999 --> 39:00.999
* let it shine...

39:07.999 --> 39:10.998
I think the gay communityis
taking this as an advantage,

39:10.999 --> 39:14.998
said, "this is a good timefor
us to exploit this".

39:14.999 --> 39:17.998
They made it sound like it
waslo murders instead of one.

39:17.999 --> 39:19.998
They're accusingthe ranchers

39:19.999 --> 39:21.998
of being unreasonableand unsympathetic.

39:21.999 --> 39:22.998
Because of how he was...

39:22.999 --> 39:24.998
And what hispersuasions were.

39:24.999 --> 39:27.998
Well, he would certainlybe
welcome in our home.

39:27.999 --> 39:31.998
We'd visit, sit down, have a cup of coffee.

39:31.999 --> 39:33.998
What did you thinkwhen you heard that

39:33.999 --> 39:35.998
two boys from your towndid this?

39:35.999 --> 39:38.998
Well, I certainly
don'tapprove of homosexuals,

39:38.999 --> 39:40.998
but I don't thinkanybody has a right

39:40.999 --> 39:42.998
to do whatthose two boys did.

39:42.999 --> 39:44.998
Well, where do you thinkthat comes from?

39:44.999 --> 39:45.998
Their hatredtowards homosexuals?

39:45.999 --> 39:46.999
I think...

39:47.751 --> 39:49.999
What most people fearin the gay community

39:50.999 --> 39:53.998
is that sexuality istheir
number one concern.

39:53.999 --> 39:55.998
Not many peoplecondone it...

39:55.999 --> 39:57.998
when you wear iton your
sleeve like a banner.

39:57.999 --> 39:59.998
Well, there'sthis whole idea,

39:59.999 --> 40:01.999
"you leave me alone, I leave you alone."

40:02.999 --> 40:03.998
It's even in some ofthe Western literature.

40:03.999 --> 40:05.998
"Live and let live."

40:05.999 --> 40:07.998
That is such crap.

40:07.999 --> 40:10.998
Basically whatit boils down to,

40:10.999 --> 40:12.998
if I don't tell youi'm a fag,

40:12.999 --> 40:14.998
you won'tbeat the crap out of me.

40:14.999 --> 40:16.998
What's so greatabout that?

40:16.999 --> 40:19.998
That's a greatphilosophy?

40:19.999 --> 40:20.998
I'll sit in church,

40:20.999 --> 40:22.998
and the reverendwill tell you flat out

40:22.999 --> 40:24.998
he does not agreewith homosexuality, right?

40:24.999 --> 40:27.998
And I just don'tfeel like I
know enoughabout certain things

40:27.999 --> 40:30.998
just to be able to say
thathomosexuality is right.

40:30.999 --> 40:32.998
When I've beenraised my whole life

40:32.999 --> 40:34.998
that homosexualityis not right, it's wrong.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.998
My parents broughtme up catholic.

40:36.999 --> 40:40.998
I was brought up tolove
the sinner, hate the sin.

40:40.999 --> 40:42.999
Love the personfor who they are,

40:43.999 --> 40:44.998
but condemn them

40:44.999 --> 40:46.998
for what they do, condemn the lifestyle.

40:46.999 --> 40:48.998
So, I wouldhave to say right
nowthat I don't agree with it,

40:48.999 --> 40:50.998
I don't agree.

40:50.999 --> 40:52.998
And maybe that's just'cause
I couldn't do it.

40:52.999 --> 40:54.998
But I don'thate homosexuals

40:54.999 --> 40:55.998
and I'm not gonnapersecute them.

40:55.999 --> 40:57.998
I'm not gonna let thisget in between

40:57.999 --> 40:58.998
me and the other personat all.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.998
You know, Orin between you and I.

41:00.999 --> 41:01.998
You know, not at all.

41:01.999 --> 41:06.999
Well, it's preached in
schoolsthat being gay is okay.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.998
If my kids asked me, I'd set them down

41:09.999 --> 41:10.998
and I'd tell them,

41:10.999 --> 41:12.998
this is whatgay people do.

41:12.999 --> 41:14.998
This is whatanimals do, okay?

41:14.999 --> 41:16.998
And I'd tell them, this is the life.

41:16.999 --> 41:20.999
This is the lifestyle,
this is what they do.

41:21.999 --> 41:25.998
And I say this is whyi believe it's wrong.

41:25.999 --> 41:28.999
Shame, shame, shame...!

41:32.999 --> 41:35.998
In New York, the protestfor Matthew Shepard

41:35.999 --> 41:36.998
turned intoa near riot.

41:36.999 --> 41:40.999
Police on horses werepushing
into the crowds.

41:50.999 --> 41:54.998
The whole world is watching,
the whole world is watching!

41:54.999 --> 41:58.998
The whole world is watching, the
whole world is watching...!

41:58.999 --> 42:00.998
As of nine A.M. today,

42:00.999 --> 42:03.998
Matthew Shepard remainsin
critical condition

42:03.999 --> 42:04.999
with severehead injuries

42:05.999 --> 42:07.998
in the surgicalneuro-intensive care unit.

42:07.999 --> 42:09.998
Respiratory support...

42:09.999 --> 42:11.998
As I told you before,

42:11.999 --> 42:13.998
it's not a lifestylewith which I agree.

42:13.999 --> 42:16.998
You stillfeel that way?

42:16.999 --> 42:18.998
Yes.

42:18.999 --> 42:20.998
The family continuesto emphasize

42:20.999 --> 42:23.998
that the mediarespect their privacy.

42:23.999 --> 42:28.998
The family also wantsto
thank the American public

42:28.999 --> 42:29.998
for their concern

42:29.999 --> 42:31.998
and kind thoughtsfor Matthew.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.998
We wentto the candle vigil.

42:33.999 --> 42:36.998
And it was so good to be
withpeople who felt like shit.

42:36.999 --> 42:40.998
I kept feeling like, I
don'tdeserve to feel this bad.

42:40.999 --> 42:42.998
And somebodygot up there and said,

42:42.999 --> 42:44.998
"c'mon, guys, let's show the world

42:44.999 --> 42:46.998
that laramie is notthis kind of a town."

42:46.999 --> 42:48.999
But it is this kind of town.

42:49.999 --> 42:52.998
If it wasn't this kind of town,
then why did this happen here?

42:52.999 --> 42:54.998
That's a liebecause it happened here.

42:54.999 --> 42:57.998
So, how could itnot be a town

42:57.999 --> 42:58.998
where this kindof thing happens?

42:58.999 --> 43:01.998
I mean, how canyou even say that?

43:01.999 --> 43:02.998
We have to mourn this

43:02.999 --> 43:05.998
and we have to be sadthat
we live in a town,

43:05.999 --> 43:08.998
a state, a country, where
shit like this happens.

43:08.999 --> 43:11.998
I mean, these people aretrying
to distance themselves

43:11.999 --> 43:12.999
from this crime

43:13.999 --> 43:15.998
and we need to ownthis crime, I feel.

43:15.999 --> 43:16.998
Everyone needsto own it.

43:16.999 --> 43:19.999
We are like this.

43:20.999 --> 43:22.998
We are like this.

43:22.999 --> 43:24.998
We are like this.

43:24.999 --> 43:25.998
Not havingto deal that much

43:25.999 --> 43:27.998
with the gay communityhere in laramie,

43:27.999 --> 43:29.998
once we startedworking into the case

43:29.999 --> 43:32.998
actually talking to peoplethat were gay

43:32.999 --> 43:34.998
and realizing what
theirunderlying fears were,

43:34.999 --> 43:38.999
that's when itsort of hit home.

43:39.999 --> 43:40.998
This is America.

43:40.999 --> 43:42.999
You don't have the rightto feel that fear.

43:43.999 --> 43:45.998
Do you think a lot of peoplein
laramie feel the same way?

43:45.999 --> 43:48.998
You're always gonna have peoplethat
hold with the old ideals.

43:48.999 --> 43:51.998
I was probably one of them14 months ago.

43:51.999 --> 43:54.998
But I'm not gonna put upwith it anymore,

43:54.999 --> 43:55.998
I'm not gonnalisten to it.

43:55.999 --> 43:57.998
If they don't likemy views on it, fine,

43:57.999 --> 43:59.999
door goes both ways.

44:01.999 --> 44:04.079
I've already lost a
couplebuddies, but I don't care.

44:04.999 --> 44:05.998
I'm...

44:05.999 --> 44:06.999
I feel more comfortable.

44:07.999 --> 44:09.999
I can sleepat night now.

44:11.999 --> 44:14.998
Well, I really want to thank
youfor having us here tonight.

44:14.999 --> 44:15.998
It's our pleasure.

44:15.999 --> 44:18.998
These gatherings, this
isa recent thing for us.

44:18.999 --> 44:21.998
This really only happenedsince Matthew.

44:21.999 --> 44:23.999
And there's a relief in
thatwe finally connected.

44:24.999 --> 44:27.998
It's nice to see there
area lot of us in laramie.

44:27.999 --> 44:29.998
Is everybodyin the company gay?

44:29.999 --> 44:32.998
No, just the three of us.

44:32.999 --> 44:33.998
Are you out?

44:33.999 --> 44:34.998
Yes.Yup.

44:34.999 --> 44:37.334
I wasn't outbefore, actually.

44:37.999 --> 44:39.998
Then I thought probablythey all know,

44:39.999 --> 44:41.998
but I'm not gonnalike tell anyone.

44:41.999 --> 44:45.998
And in the long run, your
self-esteemjust becomes shit.

44:45.999 --> 44:48.998
And I just, I couldn'tlive
like that anymore.

44:48.999 --> 44:50.998
I think a lot ofpeople decided

44:50.999 --> 44:51.998
that they didn'twant to hide anymore.

44:51.999 --> 44:53.998
I still don't feelthat free to be out here.

44:53.999 --> 44:56.998
No one's asking, I'm not telling.

44:56.999 --> 44:57.998
I've always been out

44:57.999 --> 44:59.998
and I know how to take
careof myself, but...

44:59.999 --> 45:03.998
Since the episode, I've
beenirrationally terrified

45:03.999 --> 45:06.998
and what that means iswe don't let our son

45:06.999 --> 45:07.998
walk aroundat night alone.

45:07.999 --> 45:10.998
Every time I seea pickup truck do a u-turn,

45:10.999 --> 45:12.120
I think it'scoming after me.

45:12.999 --> 45:14.998
And I'm shaking so badly, I
haveto stop doing what I'm doing.

45:14.999 --> 45:17.998
I think it's becausesomewhere inside

45:17.999 --> 45:20.999
we all know it couldhappen to us any time.

45:30.999 --> 45:31.998
Since our lastmedical update,

45:31.999 --> 45:34.998
Matthew Shepard has
remainedin critical condition

45:34.999 --> 45:36.998
with severehead injuries.

45:36.999 --> 45:38.125
As of today,

45:38.999 --> 45:41.998
the hospital will no
longeroffer medical updates

45:41.999 --> 45:42.998
on a scheduled basis.

45:42.999 --> 45:46.459
If Matthew'smedical condition changes,

45:46.999 --> 45:48.998
we will issuea new medical update

45:48.999 --> 45:52.998
and we will immediately contactas
many members of the media

45:52.999 --> 45:56.876
as is practicallypossible, thank you.

45:58.999 --> 46:01.998
All eyes are onlaramie, Wyoming today

46:01.999 --> 46:03.998
where many areturning their focus

46:03.999 --> 46:05.998
to their homecoming parade.

46:05.999 --> 46:06.998
And the fortune of

46:06.999 --> 46:08.999
the university of wyomingfootball team.

46:28.999 --> 46:31.998
This apartment has windowson
two opposite streets.

46:31.999 --> 46:33.998
One goes northand the other goes South.

46:33.999 --> 46:38.999
And that is exactlythe
homecoming parade route.

46:40.999 --> 46:42.159
Now, on the dayof the parade,

46:42.999 --> 46:44.998
I had a cast on my legbecause of a fall.

46:44.999 --> 46:47.999
And I was very disappointedbecause
I had heard that

46:48.999 --> 46:51.998
some students were gonnabe
walking for Matthew Shepard.

46:51.999 --> 46:54.998
And I wanted to join them, but I couldn't,

46:54.999 --> 46:56.998
so, I watchedfrom that window.

46:56.999 --> 46:57.999
It was just...

46:58.999 --> 47:03.999
I'm 52 years oldand I'm...

47:04.999 --> 47:05.998
I'm gay.

47:05.999 --> 47:08.998
I've lived herefor many years

47:08.999 --> 47:10.998
and I've seen a lot.

47:10.999 --> 47:13.998
And I was very movedwhen I saw the...

47:13.999 --> 47:19.999
Tag at the end ofthe homecoming parade.

47:25.999 --> 47:27.998
It was justa group of people

47:27.999 --> 47:31.999
walking behind a bannerfor Matthew Shepard.

47:39.999 --> 47:43.998
But the parade went downto
the end of the block

47:43.999 --> 47:45.998
made a u-turnaround the block

47:45.999 --> 47:48.999
and I came to the other side
ofmy apartment to watch for it

47:49.000 --> 47:52.125
to come southdown this street.

47:53.999 --> 47:54.998
Maybe...

47:54.999 --> 47:56.999
10 minutes went by.

47:59.999 --> 48:02.998
And then I saw the most...

48:02.999 --> 48:05.999
Incredible thing.

48:08.999 --> 48:10.998
As the paradecame down the street,

48:10.999 --> 48:12.998
the number of peoplemarching
for Matthew Shepard

48:12.999 --> 48:15.998
had grownlike, five times.

48:15.999 --> 48:19.999
Can you imagine?

48:20.999 --> 48:21.998
The tag at the end

48:21.999 --> 48:24.999
was bigger thanthe entire parade.

48:37.999 --> 48:38.998
I thought to myself,

48:38.999 --> 48:43.999
thank God I gotto see this in my lifetime.

48:44.999 --> 48:47.999
And my second thought was...

48:48.999 --> 48:51.999
Thank you, Matthew.

49:01.999 --> 49:03.998
I really haven't beenall
that involved, per se.

49:03.999 --> 49:06.998
My husband'sa highway patrolman,

49:06.999 --> 49:09.998
so, that's really the only
wayi've known about it.

49:09.999 --> 49:11.998
But when I firstfound out,

49:11.999 --> 49:14.999
I just thoughtit was horrible.

49:16.876 --> 49:17.998
I just...

49:17.999 --> 49:19.999
I can't.

49:20.999 --> 49:22.999
Nobody deserves that.

49:23.999 --> 49:25.998
I don't carewho you are.

49:25.999 --> 49:27.998
But I have to tell you,

49:27.999 --> 49:30.998
you know the media'sportraying
him as a Saint.

49:30.999 --> 49:32.998
They're making him outas a martyr

49:32.999 --> 49:34.998
and I don'tthink he was.

49:34.999 --> 49:36.998
Did you know him?

49:36.999 --> 49:37.998
No.

49:37.999 --> 49:39.998
I didn't know him.

49:39.999 --> 49:40.998
But...

49:40.999 --> 49:43.998
They're just so many thingsi
found out about him,

49:43.999 --> 49:46.999
that I just... it's scary.

49:47.999 --> 49:49.998
You know, about his character

49:49.999 --> 49:51.998
and spreading aids

49:51.999 --> 49:53.998
and a fewother things.

49:53.999 --> 49:55.998
Being...

49:55.999 --> 49:58.998
About the kindof person he was.

49:58.999 --> 50:00.999
Meaning?

50:02.999 --> 50:03.998
Well,

50:03.999 --> 50:05.998
he was...

50:05.999 --> 50:08.999
He was just...

50:10.999 --> 50:12.998
A barfly.

50:12.999 --> 50:16.998
So, I think he pushedhimself on around,

50:16.999 --> 50:18.998
or I don't know.

50:18.999 --> 50:20.999
But I thinkhe flaunted it.

50:21.999 --> 50:23.998
Another thing thatwasn't brought out...

50:23.999 --> 50:24.999
The same time that happenedthat
patrolman was killed

50:25.999 --> 50:26.998
and there was nothing.

50:26.999 --> 50:28.998
Nothing, they didn'tsay anything about

50:28.999 --> 50:30.998
that old manthat killed him.

50:30.999 --> 50:31.998
He was drivingdown the road,

50:31.999 --> 50:33.998
he shouldn't havebeen driving

50:33.999 --> 50:34.998
and he killed him.

50:34.999 --> 50:35.998
And there was justa little piece.

50:35.999 --> 50:38.998
And we lostone of our guys.

50:38.999 --> 50:43.998
You know, my husbandworked with him.

50:43.999 --> 50:45.998
This man was brand newon the force.

50:45.999 --> 50:47.998
But I mean, here's one of ours.

50:47.999 --> 50:52.999
And it was justa little piecein the paper.

50:53.999 --> 50:56.999
But this was sucha deliberate crime.

50:59.999 --> 51:01.999
Everybody's got problems.

51:03.999 --> 51:07.999
Why they're exemplifyingmatthew
Shepard, I don't know.

51:08.999 --> 51:09.998
A hate crime'sa hate crime.

51:09.999 --> 51:11.998
You murder somebody, you hate 'em.

51:11.999 --> 51:14.998
It has nothing to doif you're
a gay or a prostitute.

51:14.999 --> 51:17.999
I don't know.

51:19.999 --> 51:22.999
I don't understand.

51:25.999 --> 51:27.999
I don't understand.

51:36.999 --> 51:38.998
November 29th, 1998,

51:38.999 --> 51:41.998
we're about to interviewfather
Roger schmit.

51:41.999 --> 51:42.998
Here we go.

51:42.999 --> 51:45.999
Two queersand a catholic priest.

51:46.999 --> 51:48.998
Matthew Shepard

51:48.999 --> 51:51.999
has served us well.

51:52.999 --> 51:54.998
You realize that, he has served us well.

51:54.999 --> 51:58.998
I cannot mention anyone who
hasdone more for this community

51:58.999 --> 52:01.998
than Matthew Shepard.

52:01.999 --> 52:03.998
And I'm not gonnasit here and say

52:03.999 --> 52:07.998
I was justthis bold guy, no fear.

52:07.999 --> 52:09.998
I was scared.

52:09.999 --> 52:12.998
I was very vocalin this community

52:12.999 --> 52:14.998
when this happened, so,
I thought, you know,

52:14.999 --> 52:18.998
should we call the bishopand
ask him permission

52:18.999 --> 52:20.998
to do the vigil?

52:20.999 --> 52:21.999
And I was like...

52:22.999 --> 52:24.998
Hell, no!

52:24.999 --> 52:26.998
I'm not goingto do that.

52:26.999 --> 52:29.998
His permissiondoesn't make it correct.

52:29.999 --> 52:31.998
And I'm notknocking bishops,

52:31.999 --> 52:34.998
but what is correctis correct.

52:34.999 --> 52:38.998
You think violence iswhat
they did to Matthew?

52:38.999 --> 52:42.998
They did do violenceto Matthew.

52:42.999 --> 52:43.998
But, you know,

52:43.999 --> 52:46.998
can I makethis personal?

52:46.999 --> 52:48.998
Yeah, sure.

52:48.999 --> 52:52.998
Every timeyou are called a fag

52:52.999 --> 52:56.998
or you are calleda les or

52:56.999 --> 52:58.998
or a dyke.

52:58.999 --> 53:00.998
Dyke, yeah, dyke.

53:00.999 --> 53:03.998
Do you realizethat is violence?

53:03.999 --> 53:05.998
That is, that isthe seed of violence.

53:05.999 --> 53:08.998
And I would resent itimmensely

53:08.999 --> 53:10.998
if you use anything I said

53:10.999 --> 53:14.998
to somehow cultivatethat kind of violence.

53:14.999 --> 53:17.998
Well, thank you, father, for saying that.

53:17.999 --> 53:18.999
Just deal

53:19.999 --> 53:20.998
with what is true.

53:20.999 --> 53:25.998
You knowwhat is true.

53:25.999 --> 53:29.999
You need to do your bestto say it correct.

53:31.999 --> 53:33.998
These peopletrust us.

53:33.999 --> 53:34.998
You know, they want...

53:34.999 --> 53:39.999
They want everyone to knowthat
they are not this crime.

53:43.999 --> 53:45.998
It's more thanclearing laramie's name,

53:45.999 --> 53:47.998
it's clearingtheir own.

53:47.999 --> 53:50.999
And I don't knowthat we can do that.

53:59.999 --> 54:00.998
Reverend.

54:00.999 --> 54:02.998
Reverend, hi.

54:02.999 --> 54:04.998
My name's Amanda, I'm
with the theatre company

54:04.999 --> 54:06.998
that's been speakingwith
people here in laramie.

54:06.999 --> 54:09.998
Well, let me tell you...

54:09.999 --> 54:12.999
I don't know that I reallywant
to talk with anybody at all

54:13.999 --> 54:14.999
about this incident.

54:15.792 --> 54:17.998
I'm somewhat involved

54:17.999 --> 54:19.998
and I really don't
feellike it's appropriate.

54:19.999 --> 54:21.998
I completely understand,

54:21.999 --> 54:23.999
I just wanted to tell youi
went to your service.

54:24.999 --> 54:25.998
You wentto the service?

54:25.999 --> 54:27.998
On Sunday? Yes, I did.

54:27.999 --> 54:28.998
Yes.

54:28.999 --> 54:29.998
Did I meet you?

54:29.999 --> 54:30.998
Briefly.

54:30.999 --> 54:33.999
You welcomed usin the beginning.

54:34.999 --> 54:38.334
Well, I will tell youthat I am involved.

54:38.999 --> 54:40.998
Half the peoplein the case,

54:40.999 --> 54:42.998
well, the girlfriendof the accused

54:42.999 --> 54:44.998
is a member ofour congregation.

54:44.999 --> 54:46.998
And one of the accusedhas visited.

54:46.999 --> 54:49.998
I think they deservethe death penalty,

54:49.999 --> 54:54.999
but I will try to dealwith
them spiritually.

54:55.999 --> 54:57.999
Now, as faras the victim...

54:59.999 --> 55:01.999
I know that thatlifestyle is legal.

55:02.999 --> 55:04.159
But I willtell you one thing,

55:04.999 --> 55:07.998
I hope Matthew Shepard,

55:07.999 --> 55:09.998
as he was tiedto that fence,

55:09.999 --> 55:15.998
that he had timeto reflect
on a moment when...

55:15.999 --> 55:19.999
Somebody had spokenthe
word of the lord to him.

55:21.999 --> 55:23.998
And that beforehe slipped into a coma,

55:23.999 --> 55:29.999
he had a chance to reflecton his lifestyle.

55:34.999 --> 55:36.998
Thank you, reverend.

55:36.999 --> 55:37.998
I appreciateyour speaking with me.

55:37.999 --> 55:38.998
Alright.

55:38.999 --> 55:40.999
We better go.

55:50.999 --> 55:52.998
I let himsay that to me.

55:52.999 --> 55:54.998
I let himsay that to me.

55:54.999 --> 55:56.999
And I didn't sayanything back.

56:22.999 --> 56:24.998
At 12 midnight

56:24.999 --> 56:26.998
on Monday, October 12th,

56:26.999 --> 56:30.998
Matthew Shepard'sblood
pressure began to drop.

56:30.999 --> 56:32.998
We immediatelynotified the family

56:32.999 --> 56:37.999
who were alreadyat the hospital.

56:38.999 --> 56:40.998
At 12:53 A.M.

56:40.999 --> 56:43.999
Matthew Shepard died.

56:44.999 --> 56:47.167
His family wasat his bedside.

56:47.999 --> 56:51.998
The family did releasethe
following statement.

56:51.999 --> 56:55.998
They again asked me to expresstheir
sincerest gratitude to...

56:55.999 --> 56:59.998
To the entire world

56:59.999 --> 57:01.998
for the overwhelming

57:01.999 --> 57:04.998
response to their son.

57:04.999 --> 57:07.998
The family was gratefulthat
they did not have to

57:07.999 --> 57:11.998
make a decisionregarding whether or not

57:11.999 --> 57:14.998
to continue life supportfor their son.

57:14.999 --> 57:16.998
"Like a good son,

57:16.999 --> 57:18.999
"he was caringto the end.

57:19.999 --> 57:21.999
"And removed guiltor
stress from the family.

57:22.999 --> 57:25.998
"He came intothe world premature

57:25.999 --> 57:29.999
and left the worldpremature."

57:30.999 --> 57:33.999
Matthew's mother said...

57:47.999 --> 57:50.998
We'd been up for like, 72 hours straight

57:50.999 --> 57:54.998
and gone home and gone
to sleepfor half an hour

57:54.999 --> 57:56.998
and get up and come,
maybe I was just way...

57:56.999 --> 57:59.998
I don't know.

57:59.999 --> 58:01.998
When I was readingthat statement,

58:01.999 --> 58:04.998
I thought aboutmy own four daughters

58:04.999 --> 58:08.999
and she doesn'thave her kid anymore.

58:11.999 --> 58:13.998
"Go home.

58:13.999 --> 58:16.999
"Give your kids a hug.

58:20.999 --> 58:21.998
"Don't let a day go by

58:21.999 --> 58:24.999
without telling themthat you love them."

58:25.999 --> 58:28.998
And then, we startedgetting
people sending us

58:28.999 --> 58:30.998
all thesee-mails and letters.

58:30.999 --> 58:34.998
"Do you cry like a baby on
tvfor all your patients

58:34.999 --> 58:36.999
or just the faggots?"

58:37.999 --> 58:38.998
Jesus.

58:38.999 --> 58:40.998
After beingthrown into this,

58:40.999 --> 58:43.998
I guess I didn'tunderstand the magnitude

58:43.999 --> 58:47.999
with whichsome people hate.

58:48.999 --> 58:50.998
And of allthe letters we got,

58:50.999 --> 58:52.998
there were two or threethat were like that.

58:52.999 --> 58:53.998
Most were thanks

58:53.999 --> 58:58.998
for your caringand compassion.

58:58.999 --> 59:00.999
And Matthew...

59:02.999 --> 59:06.998
Matthew got caringand compassion

59:06.999 --> 59:10.999
from the momenthe got here.

59:16.999 --> 59:17.998
The charges against.

59:17.999 --> 59:20.998
Russell hendersonand Aaron mckinney

59:20.999 --> 59:22.998
were upgradedto first degree murder

59:22.999 --> 59:25.998
after Matthew sheparddied
early Monday morning.

59:25.999 --> 59:26.998
If convicted,

59:26.999 --> 59:29.998
the two men couldface the death penalty.

59:29.999 --> 59:30.998
I'll tell you what,

59:30.999 --> 59:33.998
if they put thosetwo boys to death,

59:33.999 --> 59:35.998
that woulddefeat everything

59:35.999 --> 59:37.998
that Matt would bethinking about them.

59:37.999 --> 59:40.998
Because he would notwant those two to die.

59:40.999 --> 59:42.320
He'd want toleave them with hope.

59:42.999 --> 59:43.998
H-o-p-e.

59:43.999 --> 59:45.998
Just likethe whole world...

59:45.999 --> 59:48.998
Hoped that mattwould survive.

59:48.999 --> 59:50.998
This whole thing, you see what I'm saying?

59:50.999 --> 59:53.998
This whole thingropes around hope.

59:53.999 --> 59:55.999
H-o-p-e.

01:00:10.999 --> 01:00:11.998
On the day of the funeral,

01:00:11.999 --> 01:00:13.998
it was snowingand raining so bad.

01:00:13.999 --> 01:00:15.998
By the timei got there,

01:00:15.999 --> 01:00:17.998
there were alreadythousands of people there

01:00:17.999 --> 01:00:19.560
dressed in black, umbrellas everywhere.

01:00:19.667 --> 01:00:21.998
And they hadtwo churches set up

01:00:21.999 --> 01:00:23.998
and still, there werehundreds
of people outside

01:00:23.999 --> 01:00:26.998
who couldn't fit intoeither
one of the churches

01:00:26.999 --> 01:00:27.998
and they hadthis park set up.

01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:29.999
And the park was full.

01:00:37.999 --> 01:00:39.998
Those shall notlie down with mankind

01:00:39.999 --> 01:00:40.998
as in womankind!

01:00:40.999 --> 01:00:42.998
It is abomination.

01:00:42.999 --> 01:00:45.998
Matthew Shepard lived his
lifebreaking that commandment.

01:00:45.999 --> 01:00:48.998
Now, if he repentedin his dying
hours, which we hope he did,

01:00:48.999 --> 01:00:51.998
if not, he is in hellalong
with those killers.

01:00:51.999 --> 01:00:53.998
Do you believein the Bible?

01:00:53.999 --> 01:00:54.998
Do you believeyou're supposed to

01:00:54.999 --> 01:00:56.998
separate the preciousfrom the vile?

01:00:56.999 --> 01:00:57.998
No, you don't believethat
part of the Bible.

01:00:57.999 --> 01:00:59.998
You juststand over there

01:00:59.999 --> 01:01:02.999
ignorant of the factthat
for every two times...

01:01:07.999 --> 01:01:10.999
After seeing phelpsprotesting
at Matthew's funeral,

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:13.998
and then hearing thathe's
coming back to laramie

01:01:13.999 --> 01:01:15.998
for the trialof Russell Henderson,

01:01:15.999 --> 01:01:18.998
I decided that someone needsto
stand toe-to-toe with him

01:01:18.999 --> 01:01:20.417
and show the difference.

01:01:20.999 --> 01:01:22.998
Some people aregonna be sent to hell

01:01:22.999 --> 01:01:26.998
and I thinkyou know who you are!

01:01:26.999 --> 01:01:29.998
We wouldn't be here if
thiswas just another murder

01:01:29.999 --> 01:01:31.998
that the statewas gonna handle.

01:01:31.999 --> 01:01:34.998
The state handleshundreds of murders!

01:01:34.999 --> 01:01:36.998
This murder

01:01:36.999 --> 01:01:38.998
is different.

01:01:38.999 --> 01:01:39.998
Because the gay...

01:01:39.999 --> 01:01:41.998
He's noteven from laramie.

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:42.999
He just travelsaround the country

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.999
doing his demonstrations.

01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:53.998
So, we're planningan event.

01:01:53.999 --> 01:01:55.998
We're calling it "angel action".

01:01:55.999 --> 01:01:58.998
This 21-year-oldlittle lesbian

01:01:58.999 --> 01:02:00.999
is gonna walk the linewith them.

01:02:04.999 --> 01:02:05.998
Spare not!

01:02:05.999 --> 01:02:08.999
You lift up your voicelike a trumpet!

01:02:09.999 --> 01:02:13.998
And you show my peopletheir transgressions.

01:02:13.999 --> 01:02:16.998
We are sendingthe message of God.

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:18.998
God's anger is pure.

01:02:18.999 --> 01:02:21.998
God is gonnasend someone to hell!

01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:23.999
That's God's anger!

01:02:24.999 --> 01:02:28.999
Now, we wouldn'tbe here...

01:02:43.999 --> 01:02:47.998
...to be taught by faggotsin your schools?

01:02:47.999 --> 01:02:49.999
We're not gonnalet that happen.

01:03:11.999 --> 01:03:13.998
As soon as they startedjury selection,

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:15.998
everyone was cominginto my shop with.

01:03:15.999 --> 01:03:17.998
"I don't want to beon this trial.

01:03:17.999 --> 01:03:19.998
"I hopethey don't call me.

01:03:19.999 --> 01:03:22.998
Or "oh, my God, I got
called, how do I get off?"

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:26.998
Just wanting to getas far
away from itas they could.

01:03:26.999 --> 01:03:28.999
Very fearful

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:32.999
that they were gonnahave
to be part of that jury.

01:03:33.999 --> 01:03:36.998
And then I heard hendersonhad
to sit in the courtroom

01:03:36.999 --> 01:03:40.998
while they questionedperspective jurors.

01:03:40.999 --> 01:03:43.998
And one of the questionsthey asked was...

01:03:43.999 --> 01:03:46.998
"Would you be willing

01:03:46.999 --> 01:03:48.999
to put this personto death?"

01:03:49.999 --> 01:03:51.998
And I understand a lotof
the comments were...

01:03:51.999 --> 01:03:53.998
"Yes, I would.

01:03:53.999 --> 01:03:55.998
"Absolutely.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:59.999
Yep, no problem."

01:04:00.999 --> 01:04:02.998
Can you imaginehearing that?

01:04:02.999 --> 01:04:06.998
Juror after juror

01:04:06.999 --> 01:04:09.999
after juror?

01:04:11.626 --> 01:04:15.999
These are peoplethat he knows.

01:04:16.999 --> 01:04:19.998
No wonderhe changed his plea.

01:04:19.999 --> 01:04:21.998
You entered a not-guilty
pleaearlier, Mr. Henderson.

01:04:21.999 --> 01:04:25.998
But I understand you wishto
change your plea today?

01:04:25.999 --> 01:04:26.998
Yes, sir.

01:04:26.999 --> 01:04:29.998
You understand thatthe
recommended sentence here

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:31.999
is two life sentences?

01:04:32.999 --> 01:04:34.998
Yes, sir.

01:04:34.999 --> 01:04:37.998
And do you understand thatthose
may run concurrently

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:39.998
or they may runconsecutively?

01:04:39.999 --> 01:04:41.998
Yes, sir.

01:04:41.999 --> 01:04:43.998
Before the courtmakes that decision,

01:04:43.999 --> 01:04:45.998
I understand that there
arestatements to be made by

01:04:45.999 --> 01:04:47.998
at least one individual.

01:04:47.999 --> 01:04:50.999
Let's proceedwith that.

01:04:52.999 --> 01:04:54.998
As the grandmother

01:04:54.999 --> 01:04:57.998
and the person who raisedrussell
along with my family,

01:04:57.999 --> 01:05:01.998
we have writtenthe following statement.

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:05.998
"Our hearts achefor the pain and suffering

01:05:05.999 --> 01:05:07.998
"that the Shepard'shave went through.

01:05:07.999 --> 01:05:11.998
"We have prayed for your
familysince the very beginning.

01:05:11.999 --> 01:05:14.998
"Many timesthroughout the day,

01:05:14.999 --> 01:05:16.998
"I have thought about Matt

01:05:16.999 --> 01:05:19.998
"and you will continue to bein
our thoughts and prayers.

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:23.998
"As we know that your
painwill never go away.

01:05:23.999 --> 01:05:26.998
"You have showed such
mercyand we are so grateful

01:05:26.999 --> 01:05:30.999
"that you are giving usall
the opportunity to live.

01:05:32.999 --> 01:05:33.998
"Your honor,

"we as a family,

"hope that as yousentence Russell,

01:05:39.999 --> 01:05:41.999
"that you willdo it concurrently

01:05:42.999 --> 01:05:46.999
"for two life terms.

01:05:47.999 --> 01:05:49.998
"For the russellwe know and love,

"we humbly plead, your honor,

"to not take russellcompletely
out of our lives...

01:05:57.876 --> 01:05:59.999
Forever."

01:06:05.999 --> 01:06:06.998
Mr. And Mrs. Shepard,

01:06:06.999 --> 01:06:09.998
there is not a momentthat
goes by that I don't

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:13.999
see what happenedthat night.

01:06:14.999 --> 01:06:16.998
I know what I didwas very wrong.

01:06:16.999 --> 01:06:19.998
And I regretgreatly what I did.

01:06:19.999 --> 01:06:25.999
You have my greatest
sympathiesfor what happened.

01:06:26.999 --> 01:06:29.998
I hope that...

01:06:29.999 --> 01:06:31.999
One day you will be ableto
find it in your hearts

01:06:32.999 --> 01:06:34.999
to forgive me.

01:06:39.999 --> 01:06:40.998
Mr. Henderson,

01:06:40.999 --> 01:06:43.999
this court does not believe thatyou
really feel any true remorse

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.998
for your partin this matter.

01:06:46.999 --> 01:06:48.999
And I wonder whetheryou fully realize

01:06:49.999 --> 01:06:50.999
the gravity ofwhat you have done.

01:06:51.292 --> 01:06:55.459
You drove the vehicle that
tookmatthew Shepard to his death.

01:06:55.999 --> 01:06:58.998
You bound himto that fence,

01:06:58.999 --> 01:07:01.998
in order that he mightbe
more savagely beaten.

01:07:01.999 --> 01:07:05.998
And in order that he mightnot
escape to tell his tale.

01:07:05.999 --> 01:07:09.998
You left him out therefor 18 hours,

01:07:09.999 --> 01:07:12.998
perhaps having an
opportunityto save his life

01:07:12.999 --> 01:07:15.999
and you did nothing.

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:18.998
As to count three,

01:07:18.999 --> 01:07:20.998
that being felony murderwith robbery,

01:07:20.999 --> 01:07:23.998
you are to serve a periodof imprisonment

01:07:23.999 --> 01:07:26.375
for the term ofyour natural life.

01:07:26.999 --> 01:07:27.998
For count one,

01:07:27.999 --> 01:07:29.998
kidnapping,

01:07:29.999 --> 01:07:32.998
that you are to servea
period of imprisonment

01:07:32.999 --> 01:07:34.999
for the term ofyour natural life.

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:38.999
Sentencing for count oneto run consecutive

01:07:39.918 --> 01:07:41.999
to sentencingfor count three.

01:07:52.999 --> 01:07:53.998
After this sentencing,

01:07:53.999 --> 01:07:56.998
the mormon church decidedto
excommunicate Russell.

01:07:56.999 --> 01:07:58.999
Now, he's gota mormon home teacher

01:07:59.999 --> 01:08:00.998
that visits himin prison every week.

01:08:00.999 --> 01:08:03.998
Now nobody from the churchis
gonna go visit him?

01:08:03.999 --> 01:08:04.998
Not supposed to.

01:08:04.999 --> 01:08:06.998
They're not supposedto pray for him,

01:08:06.999 --> 01:08:08.120
he'll justsort of disappear.

01:08:26.999 --> 01:08:28.997
What happenedthat night?

01:08:28.999 --> 01:08:32.999
We need to know.

01:08:34.999 --> 01:08:36.999
This townneeds to know.

01:08:43.999 --> 01:08:45.997
I need some morelight on them.

01:08:45.999 --> 01:08:48.997
I never get tiredof this play.

01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:50.997
Yeah, well, try directing it 50 times.

01:08:50.999 --> 01:08:53.997
You can relax, just keep the umbrellas up.

01:08:53.999 --> 01:08:57.997
So, I hear you're doing "angels
in America" next year.

01:08:57.999 --> 01:09:00.997
We have an obligationto reach our students.

01:09:00.999 --> 01:09:02.997
And the question is, how do you move...

01:09:02.999 --> 01:09:05.997
How do you reacha whole state

01:09:05.999 --> 01:09:08.997
where's there's such
deep-seededhostility toward gays?

01:09:08.999 --> 01:09:10.997
How do you reach them?

01:09:10.999 --> 01:09:13.997
"Angels in America" is just the beginning.

01:09:13.999 --> 01:09:16.997
And guess who'sauditioning for the lead?

01:09:16.999 --> 01:09:18.997
My parents, right?

01:09:18.999 --> 01:09:19.997
They're like, hey, so,

01:09:19.999 --> 01:09:21.999
what plays are they
doingin school this year?

01:09:22.999 --> 01:09:23.997
Oh, let's see,

01:09:23.999 --> 01:09:24.997
"angels in America".

01:09:24.999 --> 01:09:26.997
Wait, wait, wait.

01:09:26.999 --> 01:09:30.997
"Angels in America", isn't that that play?

01:09:30.999 --> 01:09:32.997
That scene?

01:09:32.999 --> 01:09:34.997
So, you're gonna...

01:09:34.999 --> 01:09:36.999
Audition for this?

01:09:37.999 --> 01:09:38.997
And, I said, um...

01:09:38.999 --> 01:09:40.999
Yeah, I am.

01:09:41.999 --> 01:09:43.997
Huge argument.

01:09:43.999 --> 01:09:45.997
There was like, this huge argument.

01:09:45.999 --> 01:09:46.999
My mom was like,

01:09:47.999 --> 01:09:50.997
homosexuality is a sin, homosexuality
is a sin, homosexuality is a sin.

01:09:50.999 --> 01:09:52.997
But the best thing, the
best thing they knew...

01:09:52.999 --> 01:09:55.998
They had just seen meright before this,

01:09:55.999 --> 01:09:58.998
they'd just seen meon stage
in "MacBeth", right?

01:09:58.999 --> 01:10:01.998
I murdered this little kidand lady mcduff

01:10:01.999 --> 01:10:02.998
and thesetwo other guys, right?

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:04.998
Mom, mom, mom.

01:10:04.999 --> 01:10:07.998
I just playeda murderer tonight

01:10:07.999 --> 01:10:10.999
and you didn't seemto have
any problem with that.

01:10:12.999 --> 01:10:13.998
So, when's the audition?

01:10:13.999 --> 01:10:14.998
Tuesday.

01:10:14.999 --> 01:10:17.998
But I tell you, man, I
have never prepared myself

01:10:17.999 --> 01:10:19.999
for an auditionlike this in my life.

01:10:20.667 --> 01:10:22.998
Never, not even close.

01:10:22.999 --> 01:10:25.998
You know, everybodysecond
guesseswhat you're doing.

01:10:25.999 --> 01:10:28.999
You know, you geta lot of heavy criticism.

01:10:29.999 --> 01:10:31.998
You dideverything wrong.

01:10:31.999 --> 01:10:33.998
You are not supposedto touch anybody

01:10:33.999 --> 01:10:37.999
unless you have your gloves
onand protective gear.

01:10:38.999 --> 01:10:42.998
Then they make you out to
besome kind of big hero.

01:10:42.999 --> 01:10:46.998
You know, some Joe blowdown the block

01:10:46.999 --> 01:10:49.999
could've done a better jobthan I did.

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:55.999
People do extraordinarythings every day.

01:10:56.999 --> 01:10:59.998
I think this has reallybrought
home to my girls...

01:10:59.999 --> 01:11:03.999
What their momdoes for a living.

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:10.998
Just a minute, just a minute.

01:11:10.999 --> 01:11:12.998
It is the decision ofthe
county's attorney's office

01:11:12.999 --> 01:11:15.998
that this willdefinitely be
triedas a death penalty case.

01:11:15.999 --> 01:11:17.998
That's all I have.

01:11:17.999 --> 01:11:18.998
Thank you.

01:11:18.999 --> 01:11:20.998
How can I protest

01:11:20.999 --> 01:11:21.998
if the shepardswant mckinney dead?

01:11:21.999 --> 01:11:23.998
I just can'tinterfere in that.

01:11:23.999 --> 01:11:26.998
But on a personal level, I
knew Aaron in grade school.

01:11:26.999 --> 01:11:28.998
He wasn't called Aaron, we called him aj.

01:11:28.999 --> 01:11:31.998
How can we putaj mckinney to death?

01:11:31.999 --> 01:11:35.998
I think right nowour
most important teachers

01:11:35.999 --> 01:11:39.998
must be Russell hendersonand
Aaron mckinney.

01:11:39.999 --> 01:11:40.998
They have to beour teachers.

01:11:40.999 --> 01:11:41.999
How did you learn?

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:44.999
What did we do as a
societyto teach you that?

01:11:45.999 --> 01:11:47.998
See, I don't know if many peoplewill
let them be their teacher.

01:11:47.999 --> 01:11:51.998
I think it would be
wonderfulif the judge said

01:11:51.999 --> 01:11:55.998
in addition to the sentence,
you must tell your story.

01:11:55.999 --> 01:11:59.998
You musttell your story.

01:11:59.999 --> 01:12:02.998
This is a tape recordingof the confession

01:12:02.999 --> 01:12:04.998
given byaaron James mckinney to me

01:12:04.999 --> 01:12:06.719
as detective in chargeof the investigation.

01:12:06.999 --> 01:12:10.999
This confession was recordedtwo
days after the attack.

01:12:14.999 --> 01:12:17.998
So, you guysgo to the fireside, right?

01:12:17.999 --> 01:12:18.999
Yeah.

01:12:19.999 --> 01:12:22.998
Where do you go afteryou
leave the fireside?

01:12:22.999 --> 01:12:25.998
Some kidwanted a ride home.

01:12:25.999 --> 01:12:26.998
Uh-huh.

01:12:26.999 --> 01:12:28.998
What's he look like?

01:12:28.999 --> 01:12:29.999
Like a queer.

01:12:30.999 --> 01:12:33.998
He lookslike a queer.

01:12:33.999 --> 01:12:35.998
Yeah, like a fag, you know?

01:12:35.999 --> 01:12:36.999
Uh-huh.

01:12:37.999 --> 01:12:39.998
Okay, so, how'd you meet him?

01:12:39.999 --> 01:12:41.998
Uh-huh. Fag?

01:12:41.999 --> 01:12:42.998
Queer guy?

01:12:42.999 --> 01:12:43.999
We met himat the bar,

01:12:44.999 --> 01:12:46.998
he asked what we were
drinkingand what we were doing.

01:12:46.999 --> 01:12:49.998
Okay, so, what happenedafter you met him?

01:12:49.999 --> 01:12:52.998
He wanteda ride home and...

01:12:52.999 --> 01:12:55.998
I just thought, well, the dude's drunk,

01:12:55.999 --> 01:12:56.998
let's justtake him home.

01:12:56.999 --> 01:12:59.998
When did you and russtalk
about jacking him up?

01:12:59.999 --> 01:13:02.998
We kinda talked about itat the bar.

01:13:02.999 --> 01:13:04.039
Tell me whathappened next.

01:13:04.999 --> 01:13:06.998
We drove him outpast Walmart.

01:13:06.999 --> 01:13:08.998
We got over thereand he starts...

01:13:08.999 --> 01:13:12.998
Grabbing my legand grabbing my genitals

01:13:12.999 --> 01:13:16.998
I was like, "look, I'm
not a fucking faggot.

01:13:16.999 --> 01:13:18.998
If you touch me again,
you're gonna get it."

01:13:18.999 --> 01:13:22.998
I don't know what the
hellhe was trying to do.

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:25.998
But I beat him uppretty bad.

01:13:25.999 --> 01:13:28.998
I think I killed him.

01:13:28.999 --> 01:13:30.999
What did youhit him with?

01:13:31.999 --> 01:13:32.999
I blacked out...

01:13:33.999 --> 01:13:35.998
My fist.

01:13:35.999 --> 01:13:36.998
My pistol.

01:13:36.999 --> 01:13:38.999
The butt of the gun.

01:13:40.999 --> 01:13:41.998
Wondering whathappened to me.

01:13:41.999 --> 01:13:43.792
I had a few beersand I don't know.

01:13:43.999 --> 01:13:45.998
It's like I could seewhat
was going on, but...

01:13:45.999 --> 01:13:48.998
I don't know, it was
likesomebody else was doing it.

01:13:48.999 --> 01:13:50.998
What was the first thingthat he said

01:13:50.999 --> 01:13:52.998
or that he didinside the truck

01:13:52.999 --> 01:13:53.998
that made youwant to hit him?

01:13:53.999 --> 01:13:56.999
Well, he put his handon my leg

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.998
and slid his hand likehe
was gonna grab my balls.

01:13:59.999 --> 01:14:04.998
When that defense team arguedthat
mckinney did what he did

01:14:04.999 --> 01:14:07.998
because matthewmade a pass at him.

01:14:07.999 --> 01:14:09.999
I justwanted to vomit.

01:14:10.542 --> 01:14:13.998
Because that's likesaying it's okay.

01:14:13.999 --> 01:14:14.998
It was disgusting.

01:14:14.999 --> 01:14:16.998
And we were alljust disgusted.

01:14:16.999 --> 01:14:18.998
It was like, just rude,

01:14:18.999 --> 01:14:20.999
rude and that was less
thanintegrous behavior

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:23.998
and we were all just disgustedby
that quality of defense.

01:14:23.999 --> 01:14:25.998
It's likethe twinkie defense

01:14:25.999 --> 01:14:27.998
when the guy killedharvey milk in moscone.

01:14:27.999 --> 01:14:29.998
It's the same thing.

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:32.998
As much as a part of me didn'twant
the defense of them saying

01:14:32.999 --> 01:14:35.998
that it was a gay bashingor gay panic,

01:14:35.999 --> 01:14:38.998
a part of me wasreally grateful.

01:14:38.999 --> 01:14:42.998
Because I was really
afraidthat in this trial

01:14:42.999 --> 01:14:44.998
they were gonna tryand say
that it was a robbery

01:14:44.999 --> 01:14:45.998
or it was about drugs.

01:14:45.999 --> 01:14:49.998
So, when they usedgay panic as the defense

01:14:49.999 --> 01:14:51.998
I thought, this is good.

01:14:51.999 --> 01:14:53.998
Because if nothing else,

01:14:53.999 --> 01:14:55.998
the truth isgonna come out.

01:14:55.999 --> 01:14:59.998
The truth isgonna be told!

01:14:59.999 --> 01:15:02.998
So, about how many timesdid
you hit him in the truck

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:04.999
before you guys stoppedwhere you left him?

01:15:05.999 --> 01:15:06.998
I'd say I hit himtwo or three times.

01:15:06.999 --> 01:15:09.998
Probably three timeswith my fist

01:15:09.999 --> 01:15:11.998
and about six timeswith the pistol.

01:15:11.999 --> 01:15:13.998
Did he ask youto stop?

01:15:13.999 --> 01:15:15.998
Well, yeah, he was gettingthe
shit kicked out of him.

01:15:15.999 --> 01:15:16.998
What'd he say?

01:15:16.999 --> 01:15:19.626
After he asked meto stop,

01:15:19.999 --> 01:15:22.999
most all he was doingwas screaming.

01:15:26.999 --> 01:15:27.998
Was Matthew conscious

01:15:27.999 --> 01:15:29.998
while Russell was tying himto the fence?

01:15:29.999 --> 01:15:30.998
Yeah.

01:15:30.999 --> 01:15:33.998
I told him, "turn aroundand don't
look atmy license plate number,"

01:15:33.999 --> 01:15:35.998
'cause I was scaredhe
would tell the police.

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:39.998
And then, I asked himwhat
my license plate said

01:15:39.999 --> 01:15:42.998
and he read it and that'swhy
I hit him a few more times.

01:15:42.999 --> 01:15:43.999
Just to be sure.

01:15:44.292 --> 01:15:47.998
My secret hope was thatthey
were from somewhere else.

01:15:47.999 --> 01:15:50.998
That then you cancreate this distance.

01:15:50.999 --> 01:15:54.999
We don't grow childrenlike that here.

01:15:56.792 --> 01:15:59.998
Well, it's pretty clear we
dogrow children like that here.

01:15:59.999 --> 01:16:02.998
So, obviously, you don't like gay people.

01:16:02.999 --> 01:16:04.998
No, I don't.

01:16:04.999 --> 01:16:06.999
Would you sayyou hate them?

01:16:07.999 --> 01:16:10.998
No, I reallydon't hate them, but,

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.999
you know, when they startcoming on to me

01:16:13.999 --> 01:16:15.998
and stuff like that, I
get pretty aggravated.

01:16:15.999 --> 01:16:17.998
So, you've been approachedby
gay people before?

01:16:17.999 --> 01:16:19.998
No, not really.

01:16:19.999 --> 01:16:21.998
Did he threaten you?

01:16:21.999 --> 01:16:24.998
This gay dude? Yeah.

01:16:24.999 --> 01:16:25.998
No.

01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:27.998
Can you answer meone thing?

01:16:27.999 --> 01:16:31.834
Why did you guystake his shoes?

01:16:31.999 --> 01:16:33.999
I don't know.

01:16:35.999 --> 01:16:39.999
I'm never gonna getto see my son again?

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:46.999
I don't know.

01:16:49.999 --> 01:16:51.998
He's gonnadie for sure?

01:16:51.999 --> 01:16:55.999
There's no doubt thatmr.
Shepard is going to die.

01:16:59.999 --> 01:17:00.998
So, what arethey gonna give me,

01:17:00.999 --> 01:17:01.999
25 to life?

01:17:02.999 --> 01:17:04.998
Or the death penaltyand
just get it over with?

01:17:04.999 --> 01:17:06.998
That's not our job.

01:17:06.999 --> 01:17:10.999
That's the job of the judgeand the jury.

01:17:17.999 --> 01:17:18.998
Now, the strange thing is

01:17:18.999 --> 01:17:20.999
20 minutes beforematthew was brought in,

01:17:21.999 --> 01:17:23.998
Aaron mckinney, one of the perpetrators,

01:17:23.999 --> 01:17:25.998
was brought inby his girlfriend.

01:17:25.999 --> 01:17:27.998
Wait, mckinneywas here?

01:17:27.999 --> 01:17:28.998
Yeah.

01:17:28.999 --> 01:17:31.998
I guess he went back into
townlater that same night

01:17:31.999 --> 01:17:32.998
and got in a fight.

01:17:32.999 --> 01:17:36.998
And so, there's aaronon one bed in my E.R.

01:17:36.999 --> 01:17:39.998
And just a few beds downis Matthew.

01:17:39.999 --> 01:17:41.999
And two days later,

01:17:42.999 --> 01:17:44.999
I found outthe connection.

01:17:45.999 --> 01:17:48.998
Has the juryreached a verdict?

01:17:48.999 --> 01:17:51.999
We have, your honor.

01:17:52.999 --> 01:17:54.998
I was very...

01:17:54.999 --> 01:17:56.998
Struck.

01:17:56.999 --> 01:17:57.998
There were two kids,

01:17:57.999 --> 01:18:01.998
they wereboth my patients.

01:18:01.999 --> 01:18:03.998
They were two kids.

01:18:03.999 --> 01:18:05.998
I took careof both of them.

01:18:05.999 --> 01:18:09.999
I took care ofboth their bodies.

01:18:10.999 --> 01:18:13.998
And I felt a greatdeal of compassion

01:18:13.999 --> 01:18:15.999
for both of them.

01:18:16.999 --> 01:18:19.998
We the jury, impaneled and sworn

01:18:19.999 --> 01:18:21.998
to try the aboveentitled cause,

01:18:21.999 --> 01:18:24.998

trulytried the matter,

01:18:27.999 --> 01:18:30.998

aaron James mckinney...

01:18:35.999 --> 01:18:37.999

01:18:39.999 --> 01:18:41.999

01:18:46.999 --> 01:18:48.999
guilty.

01:18:58.999 --> 01:19:00.998
The jury returnsto the courthouse today

01:19:00.999 --> 01:19:02.399
to start consideringthe punishment,

01:19:02.999 --> 01:19:06.375
a phase of the trial that
willprobably last until next week.

01:19:06.999 --> 01:19:09.998
I am working with mckinney, counseling him.

01:19:09.999 --> 01:19:13.999
I don't think he
canconceptualize the gravity

01:19:14.999 --> 01:19:16.998
of something likecapital punishment.

01:19:16.999 --> 01:19:19.998
But you know I'm going to bepraying
like the dickens tonight

01:19:19.999 --> 01:19:22.998
that we don't have Togo
through this next phase.

01:19:22.999 --> 01:19:24.998
I don't know if you believein
the power of prayer,

01:19:24.999 --> 01:19:26.998
but would youdo this for me?

01:19:26.999 --> 01:19:29.998
Would you just sayfrom time to time,

01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:32.998
"lord, I lifthim up to you"?

01:19:32.999 --> 01:19:34.998
Just do that for me.

01:19:34.999 --> 01:19:37.999
Of course, father.

01:19:39.999 --> 01:19:40.998
The sentencing phaseof mckinney's trial

01:19:40.999 --> 01:19:42.998
was to begin momentarily.

01:19:42.999 --> 01:19:43.998
However...

01:19:43.999 --> 01:19:45.998
Now we are hearing thatjudy
and Dennis Shepard

01:19:45.999 --> 01:19:47.998
have been approachedby
mckinney's defense team,

01:19:47.999 --> 01:19:49.998
who plead fortheir client's life.

01:19:49.999 --> 01:19:53.999
We understandmr. Shepard may
approachthe court this morning.

01:20:14.999 --> 01:20:15.998
My son, Matthew,

01:20:15.999 --> 01:20:17.999
did not looklike a winner.

01:20:18.999 --> 01:20:21.998
He was ratheruncoordinated

01:20:21.999 --> 01:20:25.999
and wore braces from the ageof
13 until the day he died.

01:20:27.999 --> 01:20:30.998
However, in hisall too brief life,

01:20:30.999 --> 01:20:32.998
he proved thathe was a winner.

01:20:32.999 --> 01:20:35.998
On October 6th, 1998,

01:20:35.999 --> 01:20:38.998
my son tried to show the
worldthat he could win again.

01:20:38.999 --> 01:20:42.998
On October 12th, 1998,

01:20:42.999 --> 01:20:45.998
my firstborn son

01:20:45.999 --> 01:20:49.998
and my hero, lost.

01:20:49.999 --> 01:20:52.626
On October 12th, 1998,

01:20:52.999 --> 01:20:57.999
my firstborn sonand my hero, died.

01:20:59.999 --> 01:21:03.999
50 days beforehis 22nd birthday.

01:21:05.999 --> 01:21:08.998
I keep wondering the same thingthat
I did when I first saw him

01:21:08.999 --> 01:21:09.999
in the hospital.

01:21:10.999 --> 01:21:12.998
What wouldhe have become?

01:21:12.999 --> 01:21:16.998
How could he have changedhis
piece of the world

01:21:16.999 --> 01:21:18.999
to make it better?

01:21:19.999 --> 01:21:21.998
Matt officiallydied in a hospital

01:21:21.999 --> 01:21:23.998
in fort Collins, colorado.

01:21:23.999 --> 01:21:27.998
He actually diedon the
outskirts of laramie,

01:21:27.999 --> 01:21:31.999
tied to a fence.

01:21:33.999 --> 01:21:36.998
You, Mr. Mckinney, with your friend,

01:21:36.999 --> 01:21:37.998
Mr. Henderson,

01:21:37.999 --> 01:21:39.998
left him thereby himself.

01:21:39.999 --> 01:21:43.999
But he was not alone.

01:21:45.999 --> 01:21:48.999
There were hislifelong friends with him.

01:21:49.999 --> 01:21:52.999
Friends thathe had grown up with.

01:21:53.999 --> 01:21:57.999
You're probably wonderingwho
these friends were.

01:21:59.999 --> 01:22:00.998
First, he hadthe beautiful night sky

01:22:00.999 --> 01:22:02.998
and the samestars and moon

01:22:02.999 --> 01:22:06.918
we used to seethrough a telescope.

01:22:06.999 --> 01:22:11.999
Then, he had the daylightand
the sun to shine on him.

01:22:12.999 --> 01:22:14.998
And through it all,

01:22:14.999 --> 01:22:16.998
he was breathing inthe
scent of the pine trees

01:22:16.999 --> 01:22:19.998
from the snowy range.

01:22:19.999 --> 01:22:23.998
He heard the wind.

01:22:23.999 --> 01:22:28.999
The ever-present Wyoming
windfor the last time.

01:22:29.999 --> 01:22:33.998
He had one more friendwith him.

01:22:33.999 --> 01:22:36.999
He had God.

01:22:39.999 --> 01:22:42.999
And I feel betterknowing he wasn't alone.

01:22:44.999 --> 01:22:47.998
Matt's beating, hospitalization and funeral

01:22:47.999 --> 01:22:49.998
focused worldwideattention on hate.

01:22:49.999 --> 01:22:53.999
Good is comingout of evil.

01:22:54.999 --> 01:22:58.999
People have said, "enough is enough."

01:22:59.999 --> 01:23:01.998
I miss my son,

01:23:01.999 --> 01:23:05.999
but I'm proud to be ableto
say that he was my son.

01:23:07.999 --> 01:23:11.998
Judy has been quoted as
beingagainst the death penalty.

01:23:11.999 --> 01:23:16.998
It has been stated that mattwas
against the death penalty.

01:23:16.999 --> 01:23:19.998
Both of these statementsare wrong.

01:23:19.999 --> 01:23:24.999
I too believein the death penalty.

01:23:25.999 --> 01:23:27.998
I would likenothing better

01:23:27.999 --> 01:23:30.999
than to see you die, mr. Mckinney.

01:23:39.999 --> 01:23:41.998
However,

01:23:41.999 --> 01:23:44.999
this is the time to
beginthe healing process...

01:23:46.999 --> 01:23:50.999
To show mercy to someonewho
refused to show any mercy.

01:24:01.999 --> 01:24:03.998
Mr. Mckinney,

01:24:03.999 --> 01:24:06.998
I am goingto grant you life

01:24:06.999 --> 01:24:11.999
as hard as it is to do
so, because of Matthew.

01:24:13.999 --> 01:24:15.998
Every time youcelebrate Christmas,

01:24:15.999 --> 01:24:18.998
a birthday, the 4th of July,

01:24:18.999 --> 01:24:20.999
remember that Matt isn't.

01:24:21.999 --> 01:24:24.998
Every time you wake upin your prison cell,

01:24:24.999 --> 01:24:26.998
remember youhad the opportunity

01:24:26.999 --> 01:24:31.999
and the ability to stopyour
actions that night.

01:24:33.999 --> 01:24:35.998
You robbed me ofsomething very precious

01:24:35.999 --> 01:24:38.999
and I will neverforgive you for that.

01:24:43.999 --> 01:24:45.998
Mr. Mckinney,

01:24:45.999 --> 01:24:47.998
I give you life

01:24:47.999 --> 01:24:51.998
in the memory of someone

01:24:51.999 --> 01:24:54.999
who no longer lives.

01:24:55.999 --> 01:24:57.998
May you have a long life

01:24:57.999 --> 01:25:02.999
and may you thankmatthew every day for it.

01:25:07.999 --> 01:25:09.999
Thank you very much.

01:25:18.999 --> 01:25:20.998
Mr. Mckinney, you will
beremanded to the custody

01:25:20.999 --> 01:25:22.998
of the Albany countysheriff's department

01:25:22.999 --> 01:25:25.998
pending transportationto
the state penitentiary.

01:25:25.999 --> 01:25:26.999
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:25:27.999 --> 01:25:29.039
that concludesthis matter.

01:25:48.999 --> 01:25:49.998
I hope when you thinkof this town,

01:25:49.999 --> 01:25:51.998
you can see something
elsethan just a crime.

01:25:51.999 --> 01:25:54.999
And understandwhy we love it so much.

01:25:56.999 --> 01:25:58.998
I think I'm just really gladthat it's over.

01:25:58.999 --> 01:25:59.999
I really am.

01:26:00.999 --> 01:26:01.998
Testifyingin this trial

01:26:01.999 --> 01:26:03.998
has been one ofthe hardest things

01:26:03.999 --> 01:26:05.998
I've ever had to doin my entire life.

01:26:05.999 --> 01:26:07.998
Don't get me wrong, I love the stage,

01:26:07.999 --> 01:26:09.998
I'm a natural for it, I love it.

01:26:09.999 --> 01:26:12.998
But the actual testifyingis
really, really difficult.

01:26:12.999 --> 01:26:14.998
'Cause what you have isyou have the lawyers

01:26:14.999 --> 01:26:16.120
who are askingyou questions.

01:26:16.167 --> 01:26:17.998
So, you have questions that
arecoming at you in this Avenue

01:26:17.999 --> 01:26:21.375
but then, you have tofunnel
them overtowards the jury.

01:26:21.999 --> 01:26:23.998
So, you funnel them over
thereand what you end up with

01:26:23.999 --> 01:26:26.998
is basically, you havea funneling system.

01:26:26.999 --> 01:26:28.999
Right?

01:26:31.999 --> 01:26:33.998
After taking the atzfor six months,

01:26:33.999 --> 01:26:35.998
I was ableto get a DNA test.

01:26:35.999 --> 01:26:36.998
And it was...

01:26:36.999 --> 01:26:38.998
About a week later.

01:26:38.999 --> 01:26:42.999
That's when I found outthat
I was negative for good.

01:26:43.999 --> 01:26:44.998
Oh, wow, thank God.

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:45.999
That's great.

01:26:46.999 --> 01:26:49.240
I tell you, we were all on our
kneessaying "hail Mary's".

01:26:49.999 --> 01:26:50.998
You know, you're just so elated.

01:26:50.999 --> 01:26:52.998
We were really happy.

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:54.998
So, what's the first thingshe does?

01:26:54.999 --> 01:26:56.998
I stuck my tongue rightin
my husband's mouth.

01:26:56.999 --> 01:26:58.998
What aboutyour daughters?

01:26:58.999 --> 01:27:00.998
Oh, man, the girls, they just bawled.

01:27:00.999 --> 01:27:02.999
They were justso happy.

01:27:03.999 --> 01:27:05.998
And the force.Oh, boy.

01:27:05.999 --> 01:27:06.998
We went outand got.

01:27:06.999 --> 01:27:07.998
Shit-faced.

01:27:07.999 --> 01:27:11.998
I just kissed everybodywho
came through that door.

01:27:11.999 --> 01:27:12.998
Reggie, they don'tneed to know that.

01:27:12.999 --> 01:27:14.998
You know what, if itwas a male or a female,

01:27:14.999 --> 01:27:15.998
I didn't care, I kissed
themright on the lips.

01:27:15.999 --> 01:27:18.998
What part of what I just
saiddid you not understand?

01:27:18.999 --> 01:27:20.999
Mom, I havealready kissed them.

01:27:31.999 --> 01:27:33.998
It's not clear to mehaving known Matthew,

01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:37.998
what story he wouldwant told about this.

01:27:37.999 --> 01:27:40.998
We won't fully understandwhat happened here

01:27:40.999 --> 01:27:44.999
until time has had a chanceto
filter that out for us.

01:27:45.999 --> 01:27:46.998
What happened here,

01:27:46.999 --> 01:27:48.998
the culture, the cost of this,

01:27:48.999 --> 01:27:50.998
the complex set of eventsleading up to it.

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:55.999
It would've been like
ustrying to stop a tank.

01:28:02.999 --> 01:28:04.998
Change is notan easy thing,

01:28:04.999 --> 01:28:06.998
and I don't think peoplewere up to it here.

01:28:06.999 --> 01:28:09.998
They gotwhat they wanted.

01:28:09.999 --> 01:28:11.998
Those two boysgot what they deserve,

01:28:11.999 --> 01:28:13.998
and we look good now.

01:28:13.999 --> 01:28:17.998
You know, it's been over a
yearsince Matthew Shepard died,

01:28:17.999 --> 01:28:20.998
and they haven'tpassed shit in Wyoming.

01:28:20.999 --> 01:28:23.998
They haven't passed itat a state level,

01:28:23.999 --> 01:28:24.998
any town,

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:28.998
anybody anywhere, has
passed any kind of laws.

01:28:28.999 --> 01:28:31.998
Anti-discrimination laws

01:28:31.999 --> 01:28:33.998
or hate-crimelegislation,

01:28:33.999 --> 01:28:35.998
nobody has passed

01:28:35.999 --> 01:28:37.999
anything anywhere.

01:28:38.999 --> 01:28:42.998
What's come out of it?

01:28:42.999 --> 01:28:47.999
What's come out of itthat's
concrete and lasting?

01:28:48.999 --> 01:28:50.998
The dead willbe commemorated

01:28:50.999 --> 01:28:53.998
and will struggle onwith the living,

01:28:53.999 --> 01:28:58.998
and we arenot going away.

01:28:58.999 --> 01:29:00.998
We won't diesecret deaths anymore.

01:29:00.999 --> 01:29:04.999
The world onlyspins forward.

01:29:07.999 --> 01:29:10.999
We will be citizens.

01:29:11.999 --> 01:29:14.999
The time has come.

01:29:23.999 --> 01:29:25.999
Bye, now.

01:29:33.999 --> 01:29:35.998
Have you evergone out to the fence?

01:29:35.999 --> 01:29:36.999
Uh-huh.

01:29:38.999 --> 01:29:40.998
I drove up to the sitein my limousine.

01:29:40.999 --> 01:29:41.998
And...

01:29:41.999 --> 01:29:43.998
See, I rememberedsomething myself,

01:29:43.999 --> 01:29:45.998
the night he and idrove around together,

01:29:45.999 --> 01:29:47.998
he said, "laramie sparkles, doesn't it?"

01:29:47.999 --> 01:29:51.998
And where he wasin that spot up there,

01:29:51.999 --> 01:29:54.998
if you sit exactlyin that spot up there,

01:29:54.999 --> 01:29:56.998
laramie sparklesfrom there.

01:29:56.999 --> 01:29:58.998
With the lowlyin' clouds, it's...

01:29:58.999 --> 01:30:01.999
It's the blue lightsthat's
bouncing off the clouds

01:30:02.999 --> 01:30:03.998
from the airport,

01:30:03.999 --> 01:30:08.998
and it goestst, tst, tst,

01:30:08.999 --> 01:30:10.998
over the whole city.

01:30:10.999 --> 01:30:11.998
I mean...

01:30:11.999 --> 01:30:15.999
I mean, it blows you away.

01:30:16.999 --> 01:30:18.998
And Matt was right therein that spot.

01:30:18.999 --> 01:30:22.998
And I can just picturein his eyes,

01:30:22.999 --> 01:30:26.999
I can picturewhat he was seeing.

01:30:27.999 --> 01:30:31.998
And the last thingthat he saw on this earth

01:30:31.999 --> 01:30:36.999
was the sparkling lightsof
laramie, Wyoming.
