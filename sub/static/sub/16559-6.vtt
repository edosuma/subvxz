00:02.583 --> 00:03.924
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:03.924 --> 00:05.256
-I think I'm your son.
-Why would you think that?

00:05.256 --> 00:06.547
You were just asking
for directions?

00:06.547 --> 00:07.798
Yeah.

00:07.798 --> 00:09.390
A violation of this nature

00:09.390 --> 00:11.302
demands we immediately
suspend your license.

00:11.302 --> 00:12.633
Nate?

00:12.633 --> 00:14.475
You don't know how long I've
been wanting this to happen.

00:14.475 --> 00:16.397
-What's going on?
-I came to return this.

00:16.397 --> 00:17.898
I wanted you and your board
to have a chance

00:17.898 --> 00:18.979
to review my lawsuit.

00:18.979 --> 00:21.192
Wanton breach of contract,
neglect.

00:21.192 --> 00:22.853
Neglect?
The fliers.

00:22.853 --> 00:24.235
Reverse my suspension.

00:24.235 --> 00:25.526
I go back to teaching
the clinic.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.907
I'm sick of lying to her.

00:26.907 --> 00:28.859
I'll break up with Meggy.

00:28.859 --> 00:29.860
Frank's gone.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.112
Frank isn't gone.

00:31.112 --> 00:32.323
Frank?

00:33.704 --> 00:35.286
It's about Frank.
What?

00:35.286 --> 00:36.617
He's in Coalport
with Bonnie.

00:36.617 --> 00:37.288
Laurel?

00:38.959 --> 00:41.041
I'm looking for Connor Walsh.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.753
Is that
whose phone this is?
Mom!

00:42.753 --> 00:44.125
Yeah, what's wrong?

00:44.125 --> 00:45.586
Annalise's house burned down.

00:45.586 --> 00:47.758
Laurel was inside,
but they found her.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.432
Officials have confirmed
one fatality

00:51.432 --> 00:53.724
and one victim said to be
in critical condition at...

00:53.724 --> 00:55.266
Hi.
You've reached Asher Millstone,

00:55.266 --> 00:57.348
and your message to me matters.

00:57.348 --> 00:58.979
Asher, call me back
the second you get this.

00:58.979 --> 01:00.181
Police
and firefighting crews...

01:00.181 --> 01:01.352
Hey, baby.
How can I help?

01:01.352 --> 01:03.104
-You can't.
-Well, where are you going?

01:03.104 --> 01:04.275
-It doesn't matter.
-Let me go with you.

01:04.275 --> 01:06.777
No, just stay here.
You're in shock.

01:06.777 --> 01:09.320
I've been through worse.
Just sit here.
One fatality
was reported at the scene.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.402
And don't steal anything.
Another victim
is in critical condition

01:11.402 --> 01:12.953
at Middleton Hospital.

01:12.953 --> 01:14.575
But the identity of that victim

01:14.575 --> 01:16.407
has not been released
to the public.

01:19.460 --> 01:21.252
He would have known
if I was lying to him.

01:21.252 --> 01:22.623
So you lied to me instead.

01:22.623 --> 01:24.705
It worked.
Did Frank
finally spread your legs?

01:24.705 --> 01:26.417
Because that's the only reason
I can come up with

01:26.417 --> 01:28.088
for you acting
this stupid.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.050
Listen to me.
Or do you miss Sam so much
that you threw yourself

01:30.050 --> 01:31.472
at the next most disgusting man
in this house?

01:31.472 --> 01:33.714
I went there for this.

01:33.714 --> 01:37.218
You shot Mahoney while
Wes was standing right there.

01:37.218 --> 01:40.431
Why?
What, you didn't?

01:40.431 --> 01:42.723
Somebody else
just happened to shoot him?

01:42.723 --> 01:43.894
It was me.

01:43.894 --> 01:46.687
Why take Wes?

01:46.687 --> 01:49.900
I needed to know she wasn't
gonna come after me.

01:49.900 --> 01:53.194
We can't use that.

01:53.194 --> 01:54.405
It's a confession!

01:54.405 --> 01:56.447
You think we can take this
to the police?

01:56.447 --> 01:59.500
That Frank won't tell them
everything that we've done? Sam?

02:03.043 --> 02:05.246
Don't blame this on Wes.

02:05.246 --> 02:06.877
You brought this on yourself.
How?

02:06.877 --> 02:08.749
Laurel.
You tried to kill Frank.

02:08.749 --> 02:10.341
You're a dumbass
if you believe that.

02:10.341 --> 02:11.712
So you didn't hire
a hitman?
I didn't.

02:11.712 --> 02:13.174
Well, Frank's trying
to frame me for this.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.255
Maybe someone
should kill him.

02:14.255 --> 02:15.846
You don't know
what you're talking about.

02:15.846 --> 02:18.138
-Don't you dare go after him.
-I did this for you, Annalise.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.099
No, you did it
for yourself,

02:19.099 --> 02:20.311
to get the love
that no one ever gave you.

02:20.311 --> 02:22.183
But guess who did.
Me.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.355
And you spit it
right back in my face.

02:24.355 --> 02:25.566
If I had wanted
to betray you,

02:25.566 --> 02:26.567
I wouldn't have come back.
Why is Meggy calling me?

02:26.567 --> 02:27.938
I wish you hadn't
because I can handle the men

02:27.938 --> 02:29.149
making a fool out of me.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.031
But you?
Annalise, please.

02:31.031 --> 02:32.573
Annalise.
After everything
that I've done for you.

02:32.573 --> 02:33.984
Annalise.
What?

02:35.576 --> 02:38.199
The police
are at my apartment.

02:38.199 --> 02:42.373
I came to meet Wes, but they
were standing at his door.

02:42.373 --> 02:44.335
Are they still there?

02:44.335 --> 02:45.956
Yeah.

02:45.956 --> 02:47.378
They're from New York,

02:47.378 --> 02:49.049
and they're investigating
a -- a shooting

02:49.049 --> 02:51.252
that Wes was a witness to.

02:51.252 --> 02:53.464
What do we tell them?

02:53.464 --> 02:55.756
Just tell them the truth --
that you don't know where he is.

02:55.756 --> 02:57.057
I thought that you guys
were all studying together.

02:57.968 --> 02:59.179
The library.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.681
Yeah.
He went to the library.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.473
He, uh, probably turned
his phone off.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.395
You know him.
Laurel, this is crazy.

03:04.395 --> 03:06.807
I mean, Wes never told me
about any of this.

03:06.807 --> 03:09.570
Miss?
Is that him?

03:09.570 --> 03:11.442
No, it's his friend.

03:11.442 --> 03:14.405
Just tell them that you
think he went to the library.

03:14.405 --> 03:15.986
Okay.

03:15.986 --> 03:18.449
Meggy?
Yeah?

03:18.449 --> 03:19.910
Don't worry, okay?
It's all gonna be fine.

03:19.910 --> 03:21.452
I'm sure he's gonna be --

03:23.083 --> 03:24.495
We don't know
that it's gonna be fine.

03:25.876 --> 03:27.628
I should
just go talk to them.

03:27.628 --> 03:29.129
Do not move.

03:29.129 --> 03:30.671
This is Frank.

03:30.671 --> 03:32.963
He gave the police your name
to make you a suspect.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.426
No. He --
Stop defending him!

03:35.426 --> 03:37.217
He thinks that we're
gonna tell the police
he killed Mahoney.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.969
This is his way
of hitting back.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.682
Take Wes' phone,
lose it at the library,

03:41.682 --> 03:44.555
and you don't leave this house
until I say so.

03:44.555 --> 03:45.936
Give it to me.

03:51.562 --> 03:52.943
No.

03:52.943 --> 03:54.655
I'm just gonna talk to them.

03:54.655 --> 03:55.986
You take another step,

03:55.986 --> 03:58.949
and I'll chain you
in the basement like Rebecca.

Ah, come on.

04:40.611 --> 04:42.743
Look, I get you not wanting
to talk about your family

04:42.743 --> 04:44.074
in front of everyone else,
but I'm your boo.

04:44.074 --> 04:45.706
You're my what?

04:45.706 --> 04:48.909
Your bae, your B.F.,
A-one since Day-one.
Says who?

04:48.909 --> 04:50.581
Um, I sleep here
every night

04:50.581 --> 04:51.912
when I'm not on duty
in the dorm.

04:51.912 --> 04:53.964
'Cause you're too lazy
to go home after sex.

04:55.376 --> 04:57.047
You still think
I'm a meat stick.

04:59.470 --> 05:02.012
Can we not do this
the night before an exam?

05:02.012 --> 05:03.514
No.

05:03.514 --> 05:05.636
Either admit that what we're
doing is more than sex,

05:05.636 --> 05:07.137
or I leave right now
for good.

05:07.137 --> 05:08.979
Is there
a square dance going on?

05:08.979 --> 05:11.642
Is Michaela finally teaching us
how to do-si-do?

05:12.933 --> 05:14.485
Okay.

05:14.485 --> 05:16.196
You don't get to mock me
while wearing my robe.

05:16.196 --> 05:17.938
And you don't get to avoid
this conversation right now.

05:17.938 --> 05:19.740
What conversation?

05:19.740 --> 05:21.201
I need to study.

05:21.201 --> 05:23.704
Everyone out.

05:23.704 --> 05:25.616
We're done.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.158
I'll spoon you, buddy.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.162
You two just break up?

05:35.215 --> 05:38.258
I stopped and asked this guy
for directions,

05:38.258 --> 05:42.723
and he just...got shot.

05:42.723 --> 05:44.555
While you were talking
to him?

05:44.555 --> 05:46.557
Yeah.

05:46.557 --> 05:48.599
Why didn't you
ever tell me about this?

05:48.599 --> 05:50.681
It's not the type of thing
you bring up

05:50.681 --> 05:52.393
when you want a girl
to like you.

05:52.393 --> 05:56.316
Maybe not at first, but we
tell each other everything.

05:58.278 --> 06:00.110
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.362
Meggy, rounds.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.534
Go.

06:03.534 --> 06:04.655
No.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.366
I can ask for the day off.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.039
I'm with Annalise.
She knows what to do.

06:09.039 --> 06:11.492
I'll call you later, okay?

06:15.546 --> 06:17.458
Good job.

06:17.458 --> 06:19.630
Are you at least
having Eve look into this?

06:19.630 --> 06:21.502
She couldn't find out
anything.

06:21.502 --> 06:23.804
Can Nate?

06:23.804 --> 06:27.968
We're not gonna ask him
to clean up our mess anymore.

06:27.968 --> 06:28.969
I'm on it, okay?

06:28.969 --> 06:30.971
Your job today
is to study.

06:30.971 --> 06:32.012
Hi.

06:35.355 --> 06:36.777
I thought
you'd have run off to Mexico

06:36.777 --> 06:38.068
to be with Frank by now.

06:39.780 --> 06:42.282
You two get to spend the day
babysitting each other.

06:42.282 --> 06:43.984
I trust
you'll be able to do that.

06:43.984 --> 06:48.989
Excuse me while I pretend
to be a good lawyer again.

06:54.204 --> 06:56.376
As you can see,
your reinstatement

06:56.376 --> 06:58.298
comes with
the following conditions.

06:58.298 --> 07:00.420
You agree to abstain
from drinking,

07:00.420 --> 07:03.504
attend AA meetings
three times a week,

07:03.504 --> 07:06.306
and submit
to random alcohol testing.

07:06.306 --> 07:09.600
We also expect to see
a change in your conduct

07:09.600 --> 07:11.932
both inside
and outside of court.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.395
This board will not tolerate
any of the moves

07:15.395 --> 07:17.558
that have characterized
your practice in the past.

07:17.558 --> 07:18.729
Moves?

07:18.729 --> 07:22.442
Ethical violations,
intimidation of witnesses,

07:22.442 --> 07:25.486
harassment of opponents,
misleading judges,

07:25.486 --> 07:27.948
being party
to any criminal acts.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.449
Uh, just to be clear,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.662
I have never been formally
charged with a criminal act.

07:31.662 --> 07:33.574
Let's keep it that way.

07:33.574 --> 07:37.788
To confirm our agreement.

07:37.788 --> 07:40.210
This is a two-strike system,
Annalise.

07:59.189 --> 08:00.771
That's good. Do you need me
to look into getting a lawyer

08:00.771 --> 08:02.653
for Wes maybe?

08:02.653 --> 08:05.365
Annalise?

08:05.365 --> 08:07.317
She get her license back?

08:07.317 --> 08:09.870
Yeah.

08:09.870 --> 08:12.703
You should call Frank,
tell him the good news.

08:18.919 --> 08:21.752
You have something
to get off your chest?

08:21.752 --> 08:23.544
I think I just did.

08:23.544 --> 08:27.217
You're responsible
for this --

08:27.217 --> 08:30.470
the anger, drinking,
her reputation right now.

08:30.470 --> 08:32.593
You want me to believe
I caused all the problems
in this house?

08:32.593 --> 08:33.894
All the problems
blew up the minute

08:33.894 --> 08:35.846
you got your little crush
on Rebecca.

08:35.846 --> 08:39.600
You have no idea
what goes on in this house.

08:45.856 --> 08:48.318
Did you see Waitlist?

08:48.318 --> 08:49.409
Where?

08:49.409 --> 08:50.701
In the exam.
I didn't see him.

08:50.701 --> 08:53.073
Oh. He probably
slept through his alarm.

08:53.073 --> 08:54.204
-What a moron.
-Hey, what case

08:54.204 --> 08:55.706
did you guys cite
for the court's decision

08:55.706 --> 08:56.827
to bifurcate
the arbitration clause?

08:56.827 --> 08:58.418
Vaden v. Discover Bank.

08:58.418 --> 09:00.040
I thought that was about
procedural unconscionability.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.662
You're both wrong.

09:01.662 --> 09:03.123
The court citation
for the decision to bifurcate

09:03.123 --> 09:05.125
was KPMG v. Cocchi.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.757
Did you guys
even read my outline?
Listen, we're not friends.

09:06.757 --> 09:09.259
Especially now that we know
about your little art project.

09:09.259 --> 09:10.971
Annalise said, no, we're not
supposed to talk about that.

09:10.971 --> 09:12.382
Why? You afraid
one of us will out you,

09:12.382 --> 09:13.764
and you'll get expelled?

09:13.764 --> 09:15.886
Leave.

09:15.886 --> 09:17.227
Well, there she goes --

09:17.227 --> 09:18.518
chewing up
and spitting out men.

09:18.518 --> 09:19.980
Good morning.

09:19.980 --> 09:23.563
While I'm sure many of you
were hoping I was gone for good,

09:23.563 --> 09:27.107
I'm back and ready
to whip you all into shape.

09:27.107 --> 09:30.450
I assume many of you read
the file on our new client.

09:30.450 --> 09:32.743
The facts.
Ms. Cohen?

09:32.743 --> 09:35.285
Dani Alvodar,
an Army veteran.

09:35.285 --> 09:37.497
She served two tours
in Afghanistan

09:37.497 --> 09:40.120
and is now facing
aggravated assault charges.

09:40.120 --> 09:43.874
I wanted to take my girl, Val,
out to celebrate her promotion.

09:43.874 --> 09:47.087
We pre-gamed at my crib and went
dancing at our favorite bar.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.338
Dani's blood alcohol level

09:48.338 --> 09:50.510
was two times the legal limit
that night.

09:50.510 --> 09:52.302
If she admits
to substance abuse,

09:52.302 --> 09:54.384
she could qualify
for Veterans Treatment Court.

09:54.384 --> 09:56.306
She'd go to rehab
rather than face jail time.

09:56.306 --> 09:58.679
That could result in
her discharge from the Reserves.

09:58.679 --> 10:00.430
She would lose
her Army pension,

10:00.430 --> 10:02.683
making her years of risking
her life for your freedom

10:02.683 --> 10:03.724
worth nothing.

10:03.724 --> 10:05.646
Anyone with a good strategy?

10:05.646 --> 10:08.608
He kept bugging us
about making out.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.360
I just thought he was one
of those straight guys

10:10.360 --> 10:11.692
who watches too much porn.

10:11.692 --> 10:13.994
We could argue
that Dani felt so threatened

10:13.994 --> 10:15.906
by the victim's hate speech

10:15.906 --> 10:17.908
that she acted
out of self-defense.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.660
The victim was unarmed
when our client

10:19.660 --> 10:21.912
sliced his neck open
like a bagel.

10:21.912 --> 10:25.205
Do you think that any jury would
believe this was self-defense?

10:25.205 --> 10:27.047
When he came up behind me,

10:27.047 --> 10:30.921
grabbed me,
trying to dance...

10:30.921 --> 10:32.592
everything went black.

10:32.592 --> 10:34.174
We can argue
"defense of others."

10:34.174 --> 10:35.175
I left a message
for the girlfriend

10:35.175 --> 10:36.556
to see if she'd testify
that Dani

10:36.556 --> 10:37.928
was just trying
to protect her.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.640
She's the ex-girlfriend, and
if you'd read the case files,

10:40.640 --> 10:42.763
you would know that
she's stationed in Germany

10:42.763 --> 10:44.564
and unwilling to testify.

10:44.564 --> 10:48.358
Please, Mr. Drake, save me
from these terrible ideas.

10:48.358 --> 10:50.230
To be honest, I'm hesitant
to even present this

10:50.230 --> 10:54.034
because it seems so obvious,
but we go with the PTSD defense.

10:54.034 --> 10:55.405
It was a rescue mission.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.328
I was guarding the Humvee when
I got attacked from behind.

10:58.328 --> 11:00.911
The combatant
put me into a choke hold,

11:00.911 --> 11:03.914
started bashing my head
into the ground.

11:03.914 --> 11:07.788
Finally, he just stopped.

11:07.788 --> 11:10.250
My sergeant
shot him in the head.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.714
Additionally, we stress
that Dani is a woman in combat.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.136
Many jurors will find that
admirable and brave.

11:16.136 --> 11:17.848
You're first chair, Mr. Drake.

11:17.848 --> 11:19.760
You'll be doing the cross
on the victim.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.641
I'll need your prep
by 8:00 p.m. tonight.

11:21.641 --> 11:23.854
And the rest of you,
come watch me and Mr. Drake

11:23.854 --> 11:25.726
kick ass in court tomorrow.

11:33.363 --> 11:35.365
You've taken
a new case already?

11:35.365 --> 11:37.317
You think it's too soon
to dive back into work

11:37.317 --> 11:38.869
after hitting rock bottom?

11:38.869 --> 11:42.412
I would never presume to know
what a woman of your talent

11:42.412 --> 11:44.284
can and cannot handle.

11:44.284 --> 11:47.828
Nor would I ever bring up
your sobriety

11:47.828 --> 11:49.379
anywhere on this campus.

11:49.379 --> 11:51.001
So, why are you here?

11:51.001 --> 11:52.712
Did I piss someone off again?

11:52.712 --> 11:56.426
Hopefully not, unless you know
someone at the NYPD.

11:56.426 --> 11:59.469
A detective called my office
this morning.

11:59.469 --> 12:03.303
They're looking for a student
of yours -- Wes Gibbins.

12:03.303 --> 12:05.515
He was absent
from class today.

12:07.437 --> 12:09.810
Okay.

12:09.810 --> 12:12.152
I'll check in with
his other professors, then.

12:23.864 --> 12:25.956
Wallace Mahoney
was an old client of mine,

12:25.956 --> 12:27.367
someone
who was out of my life.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.039
And they think
Wes shot him?

12:29.039 --> 12:31.211
His father?
Biological father.

12:31.211 --> 12:32.542
Oh, my God.
You knew about this.

12:32.542 --> 12:34.634
-Of course she did.
-I told her not to tell you.

12:34.634 --> 12:36.506
So now that you know everything,
put away your anger.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.008
I'm so sorry
you lost your dad, man.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.260
Why are
you telling us this?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.882
Because it's secrets
that's ruined us in the past.

12:41.882 --> 12:43.473
Okay. So, we let Wes
go talk to the cops.

12:43.473 --> 12:45.055
Not until we know
why he's being questioned.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.686
He can just tell them
that Frank was the shooter.

12:46.686 --> 12:48.979
No. Then he would
have to tell them about
Sam, Sinclair --

12:48.979 --> 12:50.891
That's okay. Maybe
we just need to face all
this crap head on.

12:50.891 --> 12:52.772
Even a meat stick would be
smarter than to suggest that.
Quiet.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.774
Since when
have I not protected you?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.236
Even when I hated you?

12:56.236 --> 12:57.277
Tell me.

12:59.029 --> 13:02.162
Remember what I said.
We're good people now.

13:05.245 --> 13:07.407
We'll get through this.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.712
We'll get through it.

13:32.692 --> 13:35.315
I just talked
to Vince Levin.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.816
He's willing to act
as Wes' lawyer

13:36.816 --> 13:39.779
if he goes in
for his police interview.

13:39.779 --> 13:41.321
We can trust him.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.153
Why do you say that?

13:43.153 --> 13:45.205
You spread your legs
for him, too?

13:49.789 --> 13:51.912
Say what you need.

13:51.912 --> 13:53.373
I can take it.

13:53.373 --> 13:56.086
You can't.

13:57.757 --> 14:02.132
I'm not sure
Frank gave them Wes' name.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.764
He wouldn't want to make
things worse between you two.

14:04.764 --> 14:08.098
This is just him
saving his own ass, Bonnie.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.930
He told me
he just wants to come home.

14:09.930 --> 14:11.141
Oh, stop it.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.933
He's scared, Annalise.

14:12.933 --> 14:14.474
Well, he should be.
You know what?

14:14.474 --> 14:16.276
Tell him that
the next time you see him --

14:16.276 --> 14:17.737
that if he comes
anywhere near this house,

14:17.737 --> 14:19.479
I'll kill him for real.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.074
I'm here.

14:24.074 --> 14:26.116
I came back to be with you.

14:26.116 --> 14:29.369
Because you want to
or because he wouldn't have you?

14:29.369 --> 14:33.083
Because I love you.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.211
Go home.

14:41.211 --> 14:43.213
I can help on the case.

14:43.213 --> 14:46.136
You being here
is just hurting me right now.

14:47.968 --> 14:49.769
Just go.

15:11.531 --> 15:14.034
Thank God.

15:14.034 --> 15:15.705
Wes is right inside.

15:15.705 --> 15:17.127
He hates me right now.
It's fine.

15:17.127 --> 15:19.709
Laurel.
You never told me
what Frank said.

15:19.709 --> 15:21.421
I barely saw him.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.922
Something must have happened

15:22.922 --> 15:24.804
if he really did tell
the cops Wes' name.

15:24.804 --> 15:27.217
Nothing happened.

15:27.217 --> 15:30.180
He's a sick bastard.
I warned you when we met.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.061
It's Frank.
Leave a message.

15:41.061 --> 15:44.274
You told the police who Wes is,
didn't you?

15:44.274 --> 15:46.276
Do you just hate us all?

15:46.276 --> 15:49.369
Do you want us all
to go to jail?

15:49.369 --> 15:52.242
Is that the kind of guy
you really are?

15:52.242 --> 15:57.037
If you did this,
I'll never forgive you.

16:12.512 --> 16:14.474
Hey.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.686
You can't sit with us.

16:16.686 --> 16:17.857
Are you serious?

16:17.857 --> 16:19.269
Stop keeping secrets,

16:19.269 --> 16:20.690
and maybe you'll get
your privileges back.

16:20.690 --> 16:22.812
Oh, there he is,
our first chair.

16:22.812 --> 16:24.984
You ready to fail
like your dad's condom?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.566
Do you really have
to sit right there?

16:26.566 --> 16:27.987
I just want to be ready
to replace you

16:27.987 --> 16:29.949
after you crash and burn.
Or poop your pants.

16:29.949 --> 16:31.531
Hope you don't have
a nervous stomach, dawg.

16:31.531 --> 16:34.914
How are we feeling,
Mr. Drake?
Great.

16:34.914 --> 16:36.746
I was rethinking my cross
on the victim --

16:36.746 --> 16:38.788
that maybe we can use the
Pozner/Dodd approach instead.

16:38.788 --> 16:41.291
I liked your prep questions.
Stick with your first instinct.

16:41.291 --> 16:44.334
Ms. Keating.
Welcome back.

16:44.334 --> 16:46.886
Oh, you came to watch me
kick your colleague's ass.

16:46.886 --> 16:49.219
No. Actually,
to kick your ass.

16:49.219 --> 16:52.302
I requested to be co-counsel
when I heard this was your case.

16:52.302 --> 16:55.395
You're brave.
There's nothing brave
about taking on a lawyer

16:55.395 --> 16:57.437
who's under the thumb
of the Disciplinary Board.

16:57.437 --> 17:00.019
May the best woman win.

17:01.231 --> 17:03.403
Do I sense
some animosity there?

17:03.403 --> 17:05.065
I'm doing the cross now.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.196
I spent
all night prepping.

17:06.196 --> 17:07.857
Well,
court is unpredictable.

17:07.857 --> 17:09.779
Sit down.
You may learn something.

17:13.032 --> 17:16.916
We were all dancing,
having a good time.

17:16.916 --> 17:19.659
I mean, they were
even laughing at my jokes.

17:19.659 --> 17:22.502
At what point did
the defendant become aggressive?

17:22.502 --> 17:26.506
This guy bumped into me,
and I fell up against her.

17:26.506 --> 17:29.669
She took the knife out
of her pocket, grabbed me.

17:29.669 --> 17:32.342
I thought she was joking
until I saw the blood.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.306
Your witness.

17:36.306 --> 17:40.100
Mr. Stone,
how many drinks had you had

17:40.100 --> 17:41.851
before you approached
my client?

17:41.851 --> 17:43.022
Three or four beers.

17:43.022 --> 17:44.274
So you lost count?

17:44.274 --> 17:45.815
-Argumentative.
-Sustained.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.317
Let me rephrase.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.189
This isn't
the first violent altercation

17:49.189 --> 17:50.280
you've had in a bar,
is it?

17:50.280 --> 17:51.691
Objection. Leading.

17:51.691 --> 17:53.953
Goes to establishing Mr. Stone's
pattern of violent behavior

17:53.953 --> 17:54.954
while inebriated.

17:54.954 --> 17:56.286
Permission to approach.

18:00.500 --> 18:03.873
Mr. Stone's priors
are inadmissible per Rule 609.

18:03.873 --> 18:05.004
Domestic abuse, yes.

18:05.004 --> 18:06.626
But there was
another violent incident

18:06.626 --> 18:08.258
that he had
during his time in college.

18:08.258 --> 18:10.670
Which could also
be prejudicial.

18:10.670 --> 18:13.173
I'm prohibiting the mention of
all priors against the victim.

18:17.887 --> 18:21.851
Mr. Stone, did you think
buying my client a free drink

18:21.851 --> 18:23.933
was a down payment
on a later sexual advance?

18:23.933 --> 18:26.025
Objection. Counsel
is badgering the witness.

18:26.025 --> 18:27.317
Sustained.

18:27.317 --> 18:28.568
Can you tell me
what you meant

18:28.568 --> 18:30.230
when you yelled "scissor"
to Ms. Alvodar?

18:30.230 --> 18:32.402
-Objection. Offensive question.
-Sustained.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.494
Can you describe the man
that you allegedly claim

18:34.494 --> 18:36.196
made you bump into Dani?
Objection.

18:36.196 --> 18:38.828
Outside the scope
of direct examination.
Sustained.

18:38.828 --> 18:40.700
Was the music so loud
that you couldn't hear my client

18:40.700 --> 18:42.292
repeatedly tell you
to leave her alone?

18:42.292 --> 18:43.203
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

18:43.203 --> 18:45.375
How long did A.D.A. Atwood

18:45.375 --> 18:46.746
spend coaching you
on your testimony today?

18:46.746 --> 18:48.338
Objection.
Counsel is clearly trying

18:48.338 --> 18:49.669
to impugn the witness,
Your Honor.

18:49.669 --> 18:50.800
Sustained.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.012
Please, Ms. Keating,
move on,

18:53.012 --> 18:55.675
or I'll be inclined to report
this conduct to the bar.

19:03.973 --> 19:06.105
No further questions.

19:20.740 --> 19:23.243
Professor Keating?

19:29.459 --> 19:30.920
Give me a second.

19:41.261 --> 19:43.062
Dani's ex-girlfriend
just called me back.

19:43.062 --> 19:45.355
We're not using
your stupid defense of others.

19:45.355 --> 19:47.307
It's better than that.

19:47.307 --> 19:48.728
You might even want me
to replace Simon

19:48.728 --> 19:50.189
as first chair -- again.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.901
You stole
the boy's computer.

19:51.901 --> 19:53.313
Now you want
to steal his job?

19:53.313 --> 19:55.275
He deserves it.
He's poor.

19:55.275 --> 19:56.576
He's trying
to better his life.

19:56.576 --> 19:59.489
You, of all people,
should be able to relate.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.991
So, you don't want
to know what I found out?

20:01.991 --> 20:03.533
Say it.

20:03.533 --> 20:05.124
Dani was working a desk job

20:05.124 --> 20:09.959
on the day she claims she
was attacked in Afghanistan.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.040
Our whole defense
is based on a lie.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.211
It's not a lie.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.173
You made that story up.

20:14.173 --> 20:17.297
I didn't make it up.
I stole it.

20:17.297 --> 20:19.218
Most of the time
I was over there,

20:19.218 --> 20:22.262
I had to file all the injury
and casualty reports --

20:22.262 --> 20:26.266
how soldiers were maimed,
how they died,

20:26.266 --> 20:29.058
how many pieces
they went home in.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.483
That story
might have not happened to me,

20:33.483 --> 20:34.734
but I felt it.

20:36.406 --> 20:39.909
I have to tell the judge.
No.

20:39.909 --> 20:42.282
It's illegal for me
to put you on that stand

20:42.282 --> 20:43.413
and perjure yourself.

20:43.413 --> 20:45.785
Then tell me what to do...

20:45.785 --> 20:49.038
'cause I'm not
this person.

20:49.038 --> 20:51.961
I just don't go around
knifing people at bars.

20:53.543 --> 20:56.716
I need help, not jail.

21:01.801 --> 21:05.094
I half expected to catch you
trying on her wigs and clothes

21:05.094 --> 21:07.056
all Norman-Bates-like.

21:11.150 --> 21:12.482
Annalise isn't here.

21:12.482 --> 21:13.483
I know, I know.

21:13.483 --> 21:15.695
I, um...

21:15.695 --> 21:18.658
I just came by to make sure
that my good friend

21:18.658 --> 21:21.280
was thinking about someone else
other than himself for once.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.703
Meaning?

21:23.703 --> 21:27.407
You're thinking about going
to the police, right?

21:27.407 --> 21:29.579
Telling them everything?
You should go.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.371
No, I think you should listen
to what I have to say.

21:31.371 --> 21:33.122
You blame me for everything.
I get it.

21:33.122 --> 21:34.714
Of course I blame you
for everything.

21:34.714 --> 21:37.176
You're the reason that
everything good in our lives

21:37.176 --> 21:38.878
is gone.
Frank did this.

21:38.878 --> 21:42.882
No, you did this
the minute that you killed Sam.

21:42.882 --> 21:45.805
You know, I

21:45.805 --> 21:51.731
I was just figuring out
how to get my head on straight

21:51.731 --> 21:54.484
and finally get out of
this whole mess that you made,

21:54.484 --> 21:56.736
even without
the one good thing in my life.

21:56.736 --> 21:58.358
Now Oliver's my fault?

21:58.358 --> 22:00.319
Everything that has happened
to us in this house

22:00.319 --> 22:01.941
is your fault!

22:01.941 --> 22:04.444
If you say anything
to the police...
I'm not gonna --

22:04.444 --> 22:08.448
If you mention my name
to the police,

22:08.448 --> 22:12.041
I swear to God,
I will kill you.

22:32.732 --> 22:34.814
Get in.

22:39.739 --> 22:42.071
The NYPD's
looking for Wes.

22:42.071 --> 22:43.152
You hiding him?

22:45.945 --> 22:47.787
You think that's smart?

22:47.787 --> 22:50.079
Oh, please,
don't yell at me right now.

22:50.079 --> 22:52.161
I just don't want to see
something happen to the kid

22:52.161 --> 22:53.753
'cause he got caught up
in your mess.

22:56.255 --> 22:57.547
What have you heard?

22:57.547 --> 22:58.918
They got an anonymous tip

22:58.918 --> 23:01.000
about him
being a possible suspect.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.002
I'm protecting him,
so don't worry.

23:03.002 --> 23:04.634
Wait.

23:06.095 --> 23:07.266
You've got a case with her
right now,

23:07.266 --> 23:09.559
so I wanted you
to hear it from me.

23:09.559 --> 23:12.932
Atwood and I
are seeing each other.

23:15.565 --> 23:18.518
Hmm.

23:18.518 --> 23:21.070
Well...

23:21.070 --> 23:22.982
thank you
for letting me know.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.379
What about that new bar
on 18th Street?

23:40.379 --> 23:42.041
No. I don't want
to suggest a straight bar.

23:42.041 --> 23:43.673
Why don't you go
to a bowling alley?

23:43.673 --> 23:45.465
You seriously think
this sophisticated,

23:45.465 --> 23:47.046
spiritual acupuncturist
goes bowling?

23:47.046 --> 23:48.548
I should take Heidi bowling.

23:48.548 --> 23:51.010
Yeah, I think
she'd like  that.

23:51.010 --> 23:52.472
Heidi?
Oh, yeah.

23:52.472 --> 23:55.054
She's just this blonde
I've been talking to on Tinder.

23:55.054 --> 23:57.767
Actually, you know, maybe
a hotel bar would be better.

23:57.767 --> 24:01.691
Have some drinks, get a room,
slide my key card in her slot.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.062
Here.

24:03.062 --> 24:04.944
I told Thomas to meet you
at that wine and cheese bar

24:04.944 --> 24:06.115
tomorrow at 7:30.

24:07.156 --> 24:09.158
Who's Thomas?

24:09.158 --> 24:10.199
Uh, no one.

24:10.199 --> 24:12.411
Just a stupid Internet date.

24:12.411 --> 24:13.493
It's not important.

24:15.745 --> 24:17.286
Did you talk to him?

24:17.286 --> 24:18.538
Yeah.

24:18.538 --> 24:19.629
It went well.

24:19.629 --> 24:22.291
Who? Wes?

24:22.291 --> 24:24.343
What did you say to him?

24:24.343 --> 24:25.715
What he needed to hear.

24:25.715 --> 24:27.967
Which means what?

24:27.967 --> 24:29.348
It sucks, right?

24:29.348 --> 24:32.181
Not knowing what goes on
in Annalise's house?

24:33.933 --> 24:35.975
Have any of you guys
heard from Professor Keating?

24:35.975 --> 24:37.306
She hasn't returned
any of my calls,

24:37.306 --> 24:39.098
and we have to prep Dani
for the stand tomorrow.

24:39.098 --> 24:40.810
Oh.
Actually, Annalise

24:40.810 --> 24:42.562
decided not to put Dani
on the stand anymore.

24:42.562 --> 24:44.363
Since when?

24:44.363 --> 24:47.527
Since I sabotaged your case
and nobody told you about it.

24:47.527 --> 24:49.158
You're all mean girls.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.076
Hey.
I need sleep, Wes.

24:57.076 --> 24:58.287
I know what to do.

24:58.287 --> 24:59.539
You use
the recording of Frank

24:59.539 --> 25:00.830
to negotiate immunity
for us.

25:00.830 --> 25:02.381
Then --
-I can't.

25:02.381 --> 25:04.213
You did it when Philip
sent us those videos.

25:04.213 --> 25:05.755
That was
before I was on probation.

25:05.755 --> 25:09.178
No D.A. is gonna negotiate
with me right now.

25:09.178 --> 25:10.890
You don't want
to turn Frank in.

25:10.890 --> 25:12.471
Don't be stupid.
You still care about him.

25:12.471 --> 25:14.724
I lost a child
because of him.

25:17.516 --> 25:21.400
Car accident.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.023
Your father caused it.
Frank helped him.

25:30.570 --> 25:33.653
I'm so sorry.

25:33.653 --> 25:35.615
It's not your fault.

25:35.615 --> 25:37.957
It is.

25:37.957 --> 25:39.248
All this is happening

25:39.248 --> 25:40.870
because you keep trying
to protect me.

25:40.870 --> 25:43.252
That was my choice.

25:43.252 --> 25:46.165
I took you
off the waitlist.

25:46.165 --> 25:48.337
I should have
left you alone, but --

25:48.337 --> 25:50.509
Why didn't you?

25:53.132 --> 25:55.765
I wanted to be
a better person.

26:16.195 --> 26:17.747
You guys
exchange peen pics yet?

26:17.747 --> 26:20.660
Is he bigger than me?

26:20.660 --> 26:22.581
No.
Love that.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.914
"No" meaning
we haven't exchanged photos.

26:24.914 --> 26:26.165
You're not mad, are you?

26:26.165 --> 26:28.047
Of course I'm mad.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.840
Well, I was fine with you

26:30.840 --> 26:32.511
hooking up
with half of Philadelphia.

26:32.511 --> 26:33.843
That's 'cause I was honest
about it --

26:33.843 --> 26:35.514
and maybe too honest.

26:35.514 --> 26:37.216
But you're hiding things
from me.

26:37.216 --> 26:39.018
Well, you are overreacting.

26:39.018 --> 26:41.560
No. You know what?
Answer me this.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.483
Why even go on a date
if the whole reason we broke up

26:44.483 --> 26:46.896
was because you said
that you needed time alone?

26:46.896 --> 26:49.488
Going out on dates
is part of being alone.

26:49.488 --> 26:52.401
Maybe you just don't want
to go on dates with me.

26:52.401 --> 26:54.654
Connor, we broke up.

26:54.654 --> 26:58.447
Okay? So I'm allowed
to see other people.

27:11.250 --> 27:14.133
You showed up
two days in a row.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.595
Every day you'll let me.

27:16.595 --> 27:18.597
Call that lawyer.

27:18.597 --> 27:21.140
Tell him to come here
to meet Wes tonight.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.816
Bonnie?

27:26.816 --> 27:28.437
I need your help at court.

27:28.437 --> 27:31.400
Ms. Keating,
are you ready to begin?

27:31.400 --> 27:34.363
The defense calls
Daniela Alvodar to the stand.

27:37.827 --> 27:40.079
I'm coming for you.

27:46.085 --> 27:47.456
Hi.

27:47.456 --> 27:48.788
I'm looking
for a combat record

27:48.788 --> 27:51.130
for an active Army Reserves
member, Daniela Alvodar.

27:51.130 --> 27:52.922
Can you tell us
about the events

27:52.922 --> 27:55.755
that took place
August 10, 2013?

27:55.755 --> 27:59.258
I was on a rescue mission
for aid workers in Afghanistan,

27:59.258 --> 28:01.851
guarding an Humvee when I got
attacked from behind.

28:01.851 --> 28:04.063
The combatant
put me in a choke hold,

28:04.063 --> 28:05.855
started hitting my head.

28:05.855 --> 28:06.976
This is urgent, ma'am.

28:06.976 --> 28:09.478
I heard you.

28:09.478 --> 28:13.072
I still have nightmares,
wake up screaming.

28:13.072 --> 28:15.024
Did you see anyone
about these symptoms?

28:15.024 --> 28:16.655
I went to the VA.

28:16.655 --> 28:18.697
The doctor said it was PTSD.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.280
And do you think
that this PTSD

28:21.280 --> 28:23.873
contributed to your altercation
with Jace Stone?

28:23.873 --> 28:26.125
-Objection. Speculation.
-Sustained.

28:29.959 --> 28:31.710
Can you tell us
about when Mr. Stone

28:31.710 --> 28:33.542
approached you
on the dance floor?

28:33.542 --> 28:37.426
He came up from behind me,
pressing his body against mine.

28:37.426 --> 28:39.178
Would you say
that this reminded you

28:39.178 --> 28:40.469
of the attack
that you described?

28:40.469 --> 28:41.931
Yes.

28:41.931 --> 28:44.764
I was in that moment
all over again.

28:44.764 --> 28:46.645
That's when
everything went black.

28:48.147 --> 28:49.268
One moment, please.

28:52.191 --> 28:53.813
Ms. Keating?

28:55.064 --> 28:57.526
I've just received
new evidence

28:57.526 --> 28:59.358
and request a meeting
in your chambers.

28:59.358 --> 29:01.450
It's urgent, Your Honor.

29:01.450 --> 29:02.992
Let's take 15.

29:04.533 --> 29:06.916
It's a combat report
detailing the attack

29:06.916 --> 29:08.627
that my client
just testified about.

29:08.627 --> 29:11.040
Just now your associate
came across this?

29:11.040 --> 29:13.462
If you're inferring
that someone is lying,
you would be correct.

29:13.462 --> 29:15.965
But it's not my associate.
It's my client.

29:15.965 --> 29:17.837
Explain, Ms. Keating.

29:17.837 --> 29:19.508
She was working a desk job

29:19.508 --> 29:21.470
on the day
that she said she was attacked.

29:21.470 --> 29:22.721
Had I known that,

29:22.721 --> 29:24.183
I would never have asked her
to take the stand.

29:24.183 --> 29:25.514
Judge, please.

29:25.514 --> 29:27.726
This is Ms. Keating's attempt
to get a mistrial.

29:27.726 --> 29:29.268
No, the Pennsylvania Bar

29:29.268 --> 29:31.390
requires me to inform you
of this perjury.

29:31.390 --> 29:33.022
Now, I could have kept this
from the court,

29:33.022 --> 29:34.733
but then I would be
in violation of the oath

29:34.733 --> 29:37.236
I swore
as a practicing attorney.

29:37.236 --> 29:38.988
Is that what Your Honor
would prefer?

29:43.702 --> 29:45.825
I don't get this plan.

29:45.825 --> 29:47.706
Avoiding the police is just
going to incriminate you.

29:47.706 --> 29:48.908
It's actually talking
to the police

29:48.908 --> 29:50.409
where most people
get in trouble.

29:50.409 --> 29:52.791
But my aunt is a lawyer,
so you can get a second opinion.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.173
No.
Don't call her.

29:54.173 --> 29:55.374
You need to make sure
you have the right people

29:55.374 --> 29:57.376
on your team right now, Wes.
Meggy, stop.

29:57.376 --> 29:59.718
Please.

30:02.181 --> 30:04.343
This is too much for you.

30:08.978 --> 30:10.479
I'm too much for you.

30:10.479 --> 30:13.272
No, you're not.
I am.

30:13.272 --> 30:16.485
I'm dragging you
into things you don't deserve.

30:16.485 --> 30:18.197
No.

30:19.738 --> 30:22.741
Look...

30:22.741 --> 30:25.945
you are
just scared right now,

30:25.945 --> 30:29.498
so you're pushing me away.

30:29.498 --> 30:32.211
But you need someone
who's gonna be on your team,

30:32.211 --> 30:33.712
and I want
to be that person.

30:39.218 --> 30:40.219
Wes...

30:42.131 --> 30:43.802
...please.

30:43.802 --> 30:47.056
I love you.

30:50.809 --> 30:52.181
You should go.

30:55.274 --> 30:56.475
No.

30:56.475 --> 30:58.777
Please.
I can't do this anymore.

31:02.481 --> 31:03.782
You have to go.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.720
The A.D.A.
has offered a deal.

31:31.720 --> 31:34.063
Plead guilty to Misdemeanor
Reckless Endangerment,

31:34.063 --> 31:35.354
and they forgo a new trial.

31:35.354 --> 31:36.475
So it all worked?

31:36.475 --> 31:38.277
You didn't let me finish.

31:38.277 --> 31:41.610
You have to agree
to Veterans Treatment Court.

31:41.610 --> 31:43.732
Now, you told me you had
a substance-abuse problem.

31:43.732 --> 31:46.285
So instead of jail, you
meet with a judge once a week.

31:46.285 --> 31:47.987
They monitor your progress.

31:47.987 --> 31:49.528
I'll be kicked out
of the Reserves.

31:49.528 --> 31:51.080
Would you rather go
to prison?

31:51.080 --> 31:52.581
No, but...

31:52.581 --> 31:55.034
I don't have
a substance-abuse problem.

31:55.034 --> 31:56.875
You told me
you needed help.

31:56.875 --> 32:00.749
Or would you rather go around
slitting people's throats?

32:00.749 --> 32:02.591
Being angry,
alone, miserable?

32:06.545 --> 32:11.010
This is your chance
to get better.

32:11.010 --> 32:12.101
Take it.

32:19.478 --> 32:22.441
And this spot just below
the base of the skull

32:22.441 --> 32:25.154
is Urinary Bladder 10.

32:25.154 --> 32:27.616
Poking there
release trauma and anxiety.

32:27.616 --> 32:29.908
Yeah, I-I can feel it.

32:29.908 --> 32:31.780
Yeah, I can tell.

32:49.048 --> 32:50.549
I've been wanting
to do that

32:50.549 --> 32:52.221
ever since
you mispronounced "manchego."

32:54.683 --> 32:56.685
Oh, no.
Is that how you pronounce it?

32:56.685 --> 32:57.436
Mm-hmm.

32:57.436 --> 32:58.857
Oh.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.743
Uh, Thomas, I'm --

33:14.743 --> 33:16.825
Can we pause for a second?

33:16.825 --> 33:18.537
Yeah, sure.
What's wrong?

33:18.537 --> 33:19.918
Uh, nothing.

33:19.918 --> 33:22.251
I mean, I-I hope nothing.

33:22.251 --> 33:24.753
I just --
Before we go inside --

33:24.753 --> 33:27.836
Who said
I was going inside?

33:27.836 --> 33:31.090
Oh, my -- Wow.
That's embarrassing.

33:31.090 --> 33:32.551
I just thought...

33:32.551 --> 33:34.893
That I wanted
to get you naked?

33:34.893 --> 33:38.687
Yeah.

33:38.687 --> 33:40.809
I only sleep with guys
on the first date

33:40.809 --> 33:42.981
when I don't want
to see them again.

33:42.981 --> 33:46.105
So, um...

33:46.105 --> 33:48.567
till date number two?

33:51.110 --> 33:55.744
♪ What goes up must come down ♪

33:55.744 --> 33:57.116
Good night.

33:59.828 --> 34:05.504

34:05.504 --> 34:07.126
Mm.

Is that Laurel?

34:11.049 --> 34:12.261

34:12.261 --> 34:14.843
♪ I can't wait ♪
It's Oliver.

34:14.843 --> 34:17.055
How did his date go?

34:17.055 --> 34:19.598
♪ We're much better
than they say so ♪
You really want to know?

34:19.598 --> 34:20.809
No.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.771
That's healthy.

34:26.185 --> 34:28.237
Hotel bar
was a genius idea.

34:28.237 --> 34:29.608
Heidi couldn't even finish
her second drink

34:29.608 --> 34:31.610
before she was begging me
to come upstairs.

34:31.610 --> 34:33.282
Did you come
all the way here

34:33.282 --> 34:34.243
just to tell us
that you got laid?

34:34.243 --> 34:35.864
Yeah, yeah.

34:35.864 --> 34:37.116
Why?
Is that weird?

34:37.116 --> 34:38.697
It's not weird.

34:38.697 --> 34:40.749
It just didn't happen.

34:40.749 --> 34:42.911
Yeah, fine.

34:42.911 --> 34:46.084
I made Heidi up,
but I did it to prove a point.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.507
Ah. I got that part.
Who are you?

34:48.507 --> 34:50.129
Seriously, what of kind
of person isn't jealous

34:50.129 --> 34:50.879
when they find out
their boyfriend

34:50.879 --> 34:52.131
is screwing some other girl?

34:52.131 --> 34:53.712
There you are
with that word again.

34:53.712 --> 34:55.214
I am your boyfriend,
Michaela.

34:55.214 --> 34:56.215
Who do you think you are?!

34:56.215 --> 34:57.426
Telling me
you're my boyfriend

34:57.426 --> 34:59.218
when we've never talked
about that.

34:59.218 --> 35:00.769
Because you only
are using me for sex!

35:00.769 --> 35:02.141
We're using each other
for sex.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.562
Okay, well,
I want more than that.

35:03.562 --> 35:04.773
All right?
I want to know you, Michaela.

35:04.773 --> 35:06.725
And I don't know
if I want you to.

35:06.725 --> 35:08.147
Well, that's offensive.
No, no, no.

35:08.147 --> 35:10.319
What's offensive is,
you making me your woman

35:10.319 --> 35:11.690
like we're cave people.
Okay, fine.

35:11.690 --> 35:14.493
You're not my woman.
You're my family.

35:14.493 --> 35:15.734
What?

35:17.196 --> 35:20.949
Not in
the gross sister way.

35:20.949 --> 35:23.081
I...

35:25.374 --> 35:29.127
I lost my family --
all of them.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.129
I never had a family.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.751
It's not that big a deal.

35:32.751 --> 35:35.304
What does that mean?

35:35.304 --> 35:36.635
I'm not talking about this
with you.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.057
Hey.

35:39.057 --> 35:41.019
Hey.

35:43.262 --> 35:45.264
I want to be there for you,
Michaela.

35:45.264 --> 35:47.266
No, you want me
to be there for you,

35:47.266 --> 35:50.649
like every other guy
who's screwed me over.

35:50.649 --> 35:55.534
I like you so much.

35:55.534 --> 35:58.156
♪ You're stuff gets lost ♪

35:58.156 --> 36:01.039

"Okay" like you like me, too?

36:07.746 --> 36:08.497
Whatever.

36:08.497 --> 36:11.129
No.

36:11.129 --> 36:12.751
I want you to say it.

36:19.888 --> 36:21.510
I like you, too.

36:33.982 --> 36:35.234
Vince.

36:35.234 --> 36:37.816
Ms. Keating.
Honor to meet, finally.

36:37.816 --> 36:40.078
Did Wes ask you
to wait out here?

36:40.078 --> 36:41.029
Well, I knocked,
and nobody answered.

36:43.742 --> 36:45.244
Please come in.

36:53.462 --> 36:56.174
Can I get you
a cup of coffee or tea?

36:56.174 --> 36:57.296
That sounds great.

36:57.296 --> 36:59.137
Decaf if you have it.

37:07.936 --> 37:08.977
Does Annalise
know you're here?

37:13.191 --> 37:14.192
What are you doing?

37:14.192 --> 37:15.564
You're my witness, okay?

37:15.564 --> 37:16.615
That I destroyed this.

37:16.615 --> 37:17.946
Wes! No!

37:21.239 --> 37:23.622
Why did you do that?

37:23.622 --> 37:25.954
If the cops know Frank did this,
they'll blame Annalise.

37:25.954 --> 37:27.165
What are you talking about?

37:27.165 --> 37:28.457
I just have
to tell the police

37:28.457 --> 37:30.168
what I've been saying
this whole time --

37:30.168 --> 37:32.210
I went to New York on my own.
Frank was never there.

37:32.210 --> 37:34.923
It's smart.

37:34.923 --> 37:36.965
It protects Frank, too.

37:36.965 --> 37:39.798
You think
I want to protect Frank?

37:39.798 --> 37:41.179
Don't you?

37:41.179 --> 37:43.221
No.
You knew where he was,
and you didn't tell me.

37:43.221 --> 37:44.883
Who am I here with
right now, Wes?

37:44.883 --> 37:45.974
You, not Frank.

37:45.974 --> 37:47.556
I'm just saying I get it.

37:47.556 --> 37:48.937
If you still worry about him,
that's fine.

37:48.937 --> 37:50.979
Look at me.

37:53.652 --> 37:57.656
I am not in love
with Frank.

38:07.366 --> 38:08.907
Meggy.

38:13.672 --> 38:15.624
I broke up with her.

38:19.468 --> 38:22.921
This will just make
everything more complicated.

38:22.921 --> 38:24.803
I know.

38:49.658 --> 38:51.540
Say it again.

38:51.540 --> 38:53.161
Stop.

38:53.161 --> 38:54.663
Please.
It turns me on.

38:56.715 --> 38:58.627
I like you.

38:59.718 --> 39:01.960
Again.

39:03.802 --> 39:05.924
I like you.

39:23.982 --> 39:25.323
- One minute.
- It's Laurel.

39:25.323 --> 39:27.115
Leave a message,
but I'll probably never listen.

39:27.115 --> 39:28.617
Are you with Wes?

39:28.617 --> 39:29.908
Call me back,
or you're fired.

39:29.908 --> 39:30.989
-Hey.
-Anything?

39:30.989 --> 39:32.080
No.

39:36.084 --> 39:37.836
Use the bathroom
at the Wawa.

39:37.836 --> 39:38.837
-Connor!
-Oh!

39:38.837 --> 39:40.378
Not cool, bro.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.090
You guys
have to see this.

39:42.090 --> 39:45.003
Sources confirm
that Wallace Mahoney's own son

39:45.003 --> 39:47.135
is currently being held
without bail,

39:47.135 --> 39:48.767
charged with
first-degree murder.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.432
Tell me you're with Wes.

39:53.432 --> 39:56.274
He turned himself in.
Turn on the news.

39:56.274 --> 39:58.937
...in New York City just blocks
from where Wallace Mahoney

39:58.937 --> 40:00.859
was killed five months ago

40:00.859 --> 40:02.821
with a single bullet wound
to the head.

40:17.295 --> 40:18.667
Wes?

40:18.667 --> 40:20.879
Wes?

40:20.879 --> 40:22.841
Wes, are you here?

40:22.841 --> 40:24.753
Look.

40:24.753 --> 40:26.965
Police have just confirmed
that the identity

40:26.965 --> 40:31.219
of the suspect in custody is,
in fact, Charles Mahoney.

40:31.219 --> 40:33.642
No stranger
to the justice system,

40:33.642 --> 40:36.014
Charles was charged
with the violent murder

40:36.014 --> 40:39.437
of his fiancée, Vickie Moran,
in 2005.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.900
But after
a highly publicized trial,

40:41.900 --> 40:43.692
he was acquitted and released.

40:43.692 --> 40:45.273
Frank.

40:45.273 --> 40:47.826
The arrest was made
earlier this evening

40:47.826 --> 40:50.699
after authorities found
the suspected murder weapon,

40:50.699 --> 40:54.202
an unregistered Remington 2020,
in his car.

40:57.075 --> 41:00.749
I told you --
He just wants to come home.

41:00.749 --> 41:02.501
Police say
it is still too early

41:02.501 --> 41:05.504
to speculate the potential
motive for killing his father,

41:05.504 --> 41:07.546
given that they are still
in the preliminary stages

41:07.546 --> 41:09.177
of gathering evidence.

41:09.177 --> 41:12.721
NYPD is set to hold a press
conference within the hour

41:12.721 --> 41:15.223
to explain just how they
discovered the murder weapon...
What does this mean?

41:15.223 --> 41:17.145
...at this exact time.

41:17.145 --> 41:19.057
We're safe now.
And, of course, we will cut
to that press conference

41:19.057 --> 41:20.649
as soon as it starts.

41:20.649 --> 41:23.061

Annalise's house burned down.
Someone's dead.

What?
Where's Connor?

41:56.094 --> 41:57.305
You were with him, right?

41:57.305 --> 41:58.476
And Laurel.

41:58.476 --> 41:59.517
Laurel's in the hospital.

42:01.399 --> 42:03.642
Before Annalise called us.

42:03.642 --> 42:07.485
Ohh.
Annalise called you?

42:07.485 --> 42:09.357
When you were with your mom.
She asked us to come over.

42:13.742 --> 42:16.494
Is someone really dead?
