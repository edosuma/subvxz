00:41.680 --> 00:44.320
Cora.
Hello, Rosamund.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.400
You made good time.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.200
I say!
What?

00:59.280 --> 01:02.160
Some man has opened a nudist colony
at Wickford in Essex,

01:02.240 --> 01:03.640
called the Moonella Group.

01:03.720 --> 01:06.280
What do you mean,
a man has opened a colony in Essex?

01:06.360 --> 01:08.240
Not that sort of colony, Mama.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.800
It's for people who want
to take all their clothes off.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.040
In Essex? Isn't it terribly damp?

01:14.120 --> 01:17.680
Would that make a difference?
Well, yes, if you had no clothes on.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.520
Well, I think it's a mad idea.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.600
Oh, I doubt
they were aiming it at you.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.640
I wanted to come after Mary told me
about the farmer's child

01:25.720 --> 01:27.760
you're taking such an interest in.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.040
Come to my room when you're changed.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.360
How long are you here for?
About a week, if I'm allowed.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.480
Good. We're giving a bash
for my Deputy Lieutenants on Friday.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.960
You can stay and help.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.240
I'm afraid I'll be away
on Thursday night.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.800
It's another of my Lord Loot things.

01:42.880 --> 01:46.960
I'm guest of honour at a dinner for all
the Yorkshire-based commanding officers.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.200
You're staying the night?
It's in Sheffield,

01:49.280 --> 01:51.960
and it'll be very late,
so it seems sensible.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.920
You'll just have to make do
with Cora.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
And Edith and Tom and Rose.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.680
What news of your suitor?

01:59.760 --> 02:01.480
I haven't heard from him lately.

02:01.560 --> 02:05.040
Have you decided what answer
you're going to give him yet?

02:05.120 --> 02:08.440
Well, I think I should tell him
before I tell you. Wouldn't you agree?

02:08.520 --> 02:12.680
Ellen Terry has nothing on you when
it comes to stringing out a moment.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.680
Oh, are you busy?
No, no, no. Come in.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.640
How can I help?

02:20.720 --> 02:22.600
Would you like me to leave?

02:22.680 --> 02:27.680
Oh, I'd love to think I had a secret
that was too indelicate
for a lady's ear, but I haven't.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.080
No, I've got some good news,
for a change.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.320
An old aunt's died.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.440
No, that's not the good news,
but she made old bones.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.760
Which is the main thing.
Well, the point is,

02:38.840 --> 02:40.520
she's left me a bit of money.

02:40.600 --> 02:43.640
Ah. It's a few hundred quid,
more than I've ever saved.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.320
I am glad for you.

02:45.400 --> 02:49.080
Well, she was married to a baker
and he did well, but they had no children.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.800
How nice of her to choose you.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.680
Well, I think it was in memory
of my dad, more than anything.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.560
She and he were very close -

02:55.640 --> 02:59.280
And you want my advice on what to do
with the inheritance? Is that it?

02:59.360 --> 03:00.560
It is.

03:00.640 --> 03:04.160
You'd do better asking Mr Branson's
advice. Or Dr Clarkson's.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.120
She's asking mine.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.840
But we live so out of the way here.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.280
You need to talk to someone
who's still in the game.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.200
I'll give it some thought,
Mrs Patmore.

03:13.280 --> 03:18.480
And now, if you'll allow me,
I will go up and ring the gong.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.720
Come and sit here and we can talk.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.760
I'm not going to eat you.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.440
But you are going to chew me up.

03:28.520 --> 03:32.800
Why not just tell me about
the dear little farmer's daughter?

03:32.880 --> 03:35.560
What did Mary say?
No more than that.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.800
You knew I'd bring her back.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.760
I feared it.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.200
And I still feel very sorry
for poor Mrs Schroder.

03:45.280 --> 03:48.520
I wrote to her. She told me
she's adopted another baby.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.920
Then she has solved her problem,

03:51.000 --> 03:54.040
but the question remains:
have you solved yours?

03:56.480 --> 03:59.400
Am I at least going to be allowed
to see the girl?

03:59.480 --> 04:01.760
Do you want to?
Of course.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.920
I gave up ten months of my life to
make sure she came safely into the world.

04:07.160 --> 04:11.000
The trouble is, the farmer's wife,
Mrs Drewe,

04:11.080 --> 04:13.680
she just thinks I'm a nuisance.

04:13.760 --> 04:16.600
She doesn't want me to see Marigold.

04:16.680 --> 04:22.160
So, we have a situation of infinite
danger to your reputation,

04:22.240 --> 04:26.200
which brings you no emotional reward
to compensate.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.040
Are we the first down?
It looks like it. Want some?

04:34.120 --> 04:36.000
Mmm.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.560
How is Miss Bunting?
Still teaching Daisy downstairs?

04:39.640 --> 04:42.120
She is. But don't worry.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.520
I won't ask her to join us
in the future.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.720
Cora would overrule me in a moment
if she thought it important to you.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.360
Which you don't think it should be?

04:50.440 --> 04:55.040
I know you feel excluded at times,
an outsider in your own home.

04:55.120 --> 04:59.640
Look, I am very grateful to you
and this family.

04:59.720 --> 05:03.120
But my vision of this country
is different from yours.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.800
But not from Miss Bunting's?

05:04.880 --> 05:08.480
I believe in reform
and the moral direction of the Left,

05:08.560 --> 05:11.160
and when I'm with her,
I don't feel like a freak or a fool,

05:11.240 --> 05:13.280
devoid of common sense.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.040
I would only say this, Tom:

05:15.120 --> 05:18.880
In your time here you've learned
both sides of the argument,

05:18.960 --> 05:22.160
befriended people
you'd once have seen as enemies.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.480
That's true.
You should be proud.

05:24.560 --> 05:28.200
Five years ago, would you have believed
you could be friendly with my mother?

05:28.280 --> 05:31.680
I'm not sure I'd have
believed it five minutes ago.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.800
Don't make nothing
of what you've achieved. That's all.

05:35.880 --> 05:39.480
Drinks before dinner?
Wait till Carson catches you.

05:39.560 --> 05:42.000
You'll notice I poured them myself.

05:45.680 --> 05:50.360
Anna, I've had a note
from Sergeant Willis.

05:50.440 --> 05:54.080
He says he's going to look in
this morning at 11 o'clock.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.040
To see me?
That's what he says.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.360
Anyone else, Mr Carson?
I'm not sure.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.880
He says he wants to talk
to Anna and Lady Mary.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.200
Lady Mary? Why her?

06:03.280 --> 06:06.120
I don't know.
But could you warn her?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.800
I'll tell her
when I take up the breakfast tray.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.680
May I ask... to what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

06:13.760 --> 06:15.760
I'll get straight down to it.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.920
You know how Lord Merton likes to...

06:20.000 --> 06:22.480
display his interest
in all things medical?

06:22.560 --> 06:27.600
At least, he likes to,
when in the company of Mrs Crawley.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.400
Your confidence is a compliment.

06:29.480 --> 06:33.360
I confide in you, Dr Clarkson,
because I must.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.920
Only you can help.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.680
That is more flattering still.
It's the family's fault, really.

06:40.760 --> 06:45.920
We've trained her in our ways, and the
earnest and intellectual 'bonne bourgeoise'

06:46.000 --> 06:51.480
has been replaced by...
a rather less definable figure.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.080
Are you saying you liked her better
when she was more middle-class?

06:55.160 --> 06:58.360
No, I wouldn't go that far.
But you understood her better.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.520
Precisely.
Now I do not know who she is.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.360
I do not know what it is she wants.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.160
Well, there are many who wouldn't
be puzzled by the desire

07:06.240 --> 07:09.200
to marry a lord
and live in a palace.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.080
Can I ask you a personal question?

07:12.160 --> 07:15.440
I've lived through great wars
and my share of grief.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.360
I think I can manage an impertinent
question from a doctor.

07:19.440 --> 07:24.800
Do you perhaps resent the idea of a
change of position for Mrs Crawley?

07:24.880 --> 07:28.120
I'm sorry.
I do not quite grasp your question.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.000
It bewilders me.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.720
But I will say this:

07:32.800 --> 07:35.680
Do you wish to see her live a life

07:35.760 --> 07:39.080
devoid of industry and moral worth?

07:39.160 --> 07:41.840
I do not.
And when the glitter is tarnished,

07:41.920 --> 07:43.920
you know, what then?

07:44.000 --> 07:48.440
A hollow existence
in a large and draughty house,

07:48.520 --> 07:51.480
with a man who bores her to death.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.640
It's a terrible prospect.
So our duty is clear.

07:59.560 --> 08:03.360
Oh... It's you, m'lady.

08:03.440 --> 08:07.080
Yes. I wanted to bring my aunt
to meet Marigold.

08:07.160 --> 08:10.960
This is Lady Rosamund Painswick.
May I introduce Mrs Drewe?

08:11.040 --> 08:15.480
How do you do, Mrs Drewe?
We're sorry for dropping in like
this. I expect you're very busy.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.160
I am busy, m'lady, yes.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.440
This is Marigold.

08:20.520 --> 08:23.920
Oh, I do see. She's very sweet.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Lady Edith seems to think so.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.840
Hello.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.159
Lady Edith has decided to show off
the baby to her aunt.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.120
Lady Rosamund Painswick.
Pleased to meet you, m'lady.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.039
Well, we don't want
to disturb your day.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.320
I've got to get the dinner started.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.400
Yes, of course.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.320
Goodbye, dear.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.040
Remember your...
Remember your friend, Rosamund.

08:50.120 --> 08:53.400
I should take her inside.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.480
Oh, I could always -
I'll take her.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.080
Of course.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.600
Goodbye.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.480
Well?

09:12.560 --> 09:14.840
It's exactly
what I said would happen.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.600
She wants Marigold as her toy,

09:16.680 --> 09:19.760
to be poked and prodded by every
stray guest from the big house!

09:19.840 --> 09:22.840
And you've done this.
You've done it!

09:24.040 --> 09:26.240
What did you mean
by saying to Mrs Patmore

09:26.320 --> 09:29.840
we were living our lives
out of the way, not in the game?

09:29.920 --> 09:31.280
Well, we are.

09:31.360 --> 09:34.280
Why does everyone talk as if
we don't live in the modern world?

09:34.360 --> 09:36.960
You don't agree with that, then?
No.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.120
Does the King not live in the world
of today?

09:40.200 --> 09:42.680
Does Mr Sargent not paint
modern pictures?

09:42.760 --> 09:45.840
Does Mr Kipling not write
modern books?

09:47.440 --> 09:52.840
So, what are you going to tell her?
I don't know yet. I shall consider.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.480
Sergeant Willis is asking for you,
Mr Carson.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.520
He's got a man with him
from London, he says.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.920
They're in the library now.
They?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.760
An Inspector's come
from Scotland Yard.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.200
What does he want with me?

10:12.280 --> 10:15.560
What does he want with any of us?
None of it makes any sense.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.080
By the way, I'd like to catch
the ten-o'clock train tomorrow.

10:22.160 --> 10:25.520
I'm dining with Mr Blake
and I don't want to be in a rush.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.800
Will we stay at Lady Rosamund's?

10:27.880 --> 10:30.560
She doesn't mind. She's told Mead.

10:30.640 --> 10:34.400
Will you see Lord Gillingham?
I don't think so.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.480
So you haven't changed your mind?

10:38.120 --> 10:40.520
Right. Let's get this over with.

10:44.880 --> 10:48.760
Have I finished us off
before we ever really got started?

10:48.840 --> 10:51.480
You've pitted yourself against them
from the start.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.440
How can you retreat
from that position?

10:53.520 --> 10:55.600
You mean I've made it 'them or me'?

10:55.680 --> 10:58.000
Haven't you?

10:58.080 --> 11:01.760
You despise the family, but I think
you forget my wife was one of them.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.680
My child IS one of them.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.440
Where does that leave me?

11:05.520 --> 11:08.280
Don't you despise them? Really?

11:08.360 --> 11:10.360
No, I don't.

11:11.360 --> 11:15.560
I'd like things to change, but I don't think
in black-and-white terms any more.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.800
While I do?
Look, I'm not going to pretend

11:17.880 --> 11:20.160
I haven't enjoyed knowing you.

11:20.240 --> 11:24.360
In fact, I'm relieved to know I'm
not the only Socialist left on this earth.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.880
But maybe we should call it a day,
before one of us gets hurt.

11:50.820 --> 11:53.340
I don't know what else to add,
Mr Vyner.

11:53.420 --> 11:56.140
I remember we had to race
to catch the train.

11:56.220 --> 11:59.220
I'd had lunch with Lord Gillingham
and I needed to get home,

11:59.299 --> 12:01.899
as the church fete was planned
for the following day.

12:01.979 --> 12:04.699
And it was during the fete
that Lord Gillingham arrived

12:04.779 --> 12:06.499
with the news of Mr Green's death?

12:06.580 --> 12:08.580
That's right. And I told Anna.

12:08.659 --> 12:09.979
Hmm.

12:10.059 --> 12:12.539
Was it a great surprise?

12:12.619 --> 12:14.939
I think I would have
called it a shock.

12:15.019 --> 12:16.659
She was very shocked.

12:16.739 --> 12:19.579
Was she? Was she, indeed?

12:21.139 --> 12:25.299
Can I go now? I think Lady Mary
has given what help she can.

12:25.379 --> 12:28.179
Erm... will you confirm
that Mrs Bates was in London

12:28.259 --> 12:31.419
on the morning that Mr Green died
and that you don't know where?

12:31.499 --> 12:33.539
I only have to ask her.

12:33.619 --> 12:35.859
Secondly,
you have no reason to believe

12:35.939 --> 12:38.619
that Bates was anywhere
further south than York?

12:38.699 --> 12:40.699
No reason at all.

12:45.459 --> 12:48.579
I think they'd enjoy
getting to know each other better.

12:48.659 --> 12:51.979
I think it's a nice idea,
but shouldn't I do it, for once?

12:52.059 --> 12:54.179
I always seem to be taking luncheon
off you.

12:54.259 --> 12:55.859
No, I'd rather.

12:55.939 --> 12:58.899
You see, Mrs Potter likes
to have people to cook for.

12:59.939 --> 13:03.259
And Spratt needs something
to occupy his mind.

13:03.339 --> 13:05.019
Oh?

13:05.099 --> 13:10.219
We both have an inkling that my maid
Collins is on the way out.

13:10.299 --> 13:13.859
Oh, I do hope not.
No, I don't mean she's dying.

13:13.939 --> 13:16.139
I mean she's on her way
out of my house.

13:16.219 --> 13:19.019
She keeps talking
about her mother being infirm.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.579
But I'm infirm.
Why doesn't she think about that?

13:22.659 --> 13:24.659
You're as infirm as Windsor Castle.

13:25.779 --> 13:28.539
And why does Spratt mind,
particularly?

13:28.619 --> 13:31.779
Because he likes things
to be just so.

13:31.859 --> 13:37.219
But also,
I think Collins was his creature

13:37.299 --> 13:39.899
and does his bidding
without qualm or query.

13:39.979 --> 13:42.139
He can't be sure of that
in the next one.

13:42.219 --> 13:46.579
Well, never having had a lady's maid, it's
not a challenge I've had to tussle with.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.619
But you'll come on Thursday?
I will.

13:49.699 --> 13:52.179
I think it would be nice
for Doctor Clarkson

13:52.259 --> 13:55.179
to see beyond Lord Merton's
position and get to know the man.

13:55.259 --> 13:56.979
I agree.

13:57.059 --> 14:00.259
Oh!
I knew I had something to tell you.

14:01.859 --> 14:05.859
Shrimpie thinks he may be
on the trail of Princess Kuragin.

14:05.939 --> 14:07.499
Oh, I am pleased.

14:07.579 --> 14:12.739
Yes, he's heard a rumour of some
Russian nurses working in...

14:12.819 --> 14:14.939
Wan... Wan Chai?

14:15.019 --> 14:17.859
And that's in Hong Kong?
Well, nearby, I think.

14:17.939 --> 14:20.379
Well, it sounds much better
than it might have been.

14:20.459 --> 14:24.019
Yes. The idea of Princess Irina
scrubbing the sick

14:24.099 --> 14:27.259
and emptying bedpans
is a cheering one.

14:27.339 --> 14:31.819
Will you tell her husband? No,
I'll wait until Shrimpie is certain.

14:31.899 --> 14:35.339
These things
must be managed carefully.

14:35.419 --> 14:37.419
Yes.

14:37.499 --> 14:40.819
Sounds as if this must be managed
very carefully.

14:43.899 --> 14:48.379
Why did Mr Carson try to hide
that you were in London on that day?

14:48.459 --> 14:51.179
I don't think he tried to hide
anything. He just forgot.

14:51.259 --> 14:54.699
Isn't it a big thing when a member
of the staff goes to London?

14:54.779 --> 14:57.379
Not for a lady's maid.
Mrs Hughes, please.

14:57.459 --> 15:00.779
She's right. It's not a big thing
for ladies' maids or valets.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.539
I'm going tomorrow with Lady Mary.

15:02.619 --> 15:04.619
And you liked Mr Green?

15:05.779 --> 15:08.499
Yes. I did. Very much.

15:08.579 --> 15:10.219
He wasn't so fond of your husband.

15:10.299 --> 15:12.579
Well,
there's no accounting for taste.

15:12.659 --> 15:16.219
Don't go away, Mrs Bates.

15:16.299 --> 15:18.739
You've said you'll be in London.
I've no objection.

15:18.819 --> 15:20.819
But don't go away.

15:25.659 --> 15:30.019
I'm very sorry, My Lord.
I wonder if you know when we can
get in here and lay the table.

15:30.099 --> 15:33.699
The police have taken over the
library, and I needed to spread these out.

15:33.779 --> 15:37.699
What are they for? I'm trying to
formulate my plans for the village,

15:37.779 --> 15:39.659
and I'm looking into some builders.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.899
You won't use
the ordinary maintenance team?

15:41.979 --> 15:43.539
It would be beyond them.

15:43.619 --> 15:45.419
Have you made your choice?

15:45.499 --> 15:49.979
I'll have to talk to Lady Mary,
but I like the look of this outfit.

15:51.699 --> 15:55.899
They're based in Thirsk, so they're
local, and their work is excellent.

15:55.979 --> 15:58.059
Of course,
we should all invest in building.

15:58.139 --> 16:00.979
Fortunes will be made
over the next few years.

16:10.539 --> 16:12.659
Why don't I hold the bags,
while you do that?

16:12.739 --> 16:15.299
Oh, that's frightfully nice of you!
Are you sure?

16:15.379 --> 16:17.379
Quite sure.

16:24.019 --> 16:27.019
Erm... I can have them back now.
I shouldn't dream of it.

16:27.099 --> 16:28.619
Where are you going?

16:28.699 --> 16:30.699
Erm... just to St Mary Magdalene's.

16:32.139 --> 16:34.739
You must have a very sweet tooth!

16:34.819 --> 16:37.379
No, they're not for me.

16:37.459 --> 16:42.939
I give tea to some Russian refugees
every Tuesday and Thursday. They love cake.

16:43.019 --> 16:46.339
I love cake.
Oh, come and have some, if you like.

16:55.739 --> 16:58.939
Are you interested in Russia?
Not terribly...

16:59.019 --> 17:00.779
although I am very sorry
for them all.

17:00.859 --> 17:02.219
Of course.

17:02.299 --> 17:04.059
I should be more interested, really.

17:04.138 --> 17:07.059
Why?
I have a bit of Russian blood.

17:07.138 --> 17:09.739
How extraordinary!
It's true.

17:09.819 --> 17:13.539
In a way, my family is Russian.
Or, at least, they used to be.

17:13.618 --> 17:15.779
Well, now I insist.
Come and have some tea.

17:15.858 --> 17:18.299
By way of a thank-you.

17:18.378 --> 17:22.579
I suppose we ought to introduce
ourselves, even if it feels funny.

17:22.659 --> 17:24.499
Erm... Rose MacClare.

17:24.579 --> 17:27.259
Atticus Aldridge, at your service.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.019
That doesn't sound very Russian.

17:29.099 --> 17:31.259
Well, we weren't called Aldridge
back then.

17:38.179 --> 17:43.099
Mrs Patmore, I think I may have
a solution to your problem.

17:43.179 --> 17:44.539
Oh, that's good to hear.

17:44.619 --> 17:47.099
Why not invest
in the building trade?

17:47.179 --> 17:50.979
With the expansion that's going on
everywhere, you'd soon see a good return.

17:51.059 --> 17:53.299
Oh. Well, that's a thought.

17:53.379 --> 17:55.459
Had you any special firm in mind?

17:55.539 --> 17:57.979
What about WP Moss?

17:58.059 --> 18:03.379
They're based in Thirsk, they're expanding,
and I hear their name everywhere.

18:03.459 --> 18:06.459
I expect you keep your ear to
the ground about that sort of thing.

18:06.539 --> 18:09.659
I like to keep abreast
of what's going on in the world.

18:09.739 --> 18:15.299
So, can you buy shares in WP Moss?
I mean, have they gone public?

18:15.379 --> 18:19.059
Well, erm...
you'll have to make enquiries.

18:20.539 --> 18:24.739
Miss Bunting? I must confess
I am surprised to see you here.

18:24.819 --> 18:27.259
Rest easy, Mr Carson.
I've come to say goodbye.

18:27.339 --> 18:29.059
She's leaving the school, isn't she?

18:29.139 --> 18:33.459
She's leaving the school
and the village, because Mr Branson
won't stand up to His Lordship.

18:33.539 --> 18:35.859
You are nudging impertinence, Daisy.

18:35.939 --> 18:39.579
I should think carefully
before you say one more word.

18:39.659 --> 18:41.139
Are you going? Honestly?

18:41.219 --> 18:45.299
I am, but the situation's
not quite as Daisy recounted it.

18:45.379 --> 18:46.859
We already knew that.

18:46.939 --> 18:50.459
I've had an offer, from a school
in Preston, in Lancashire.

18:50.539 --> 18:53.819
A grammar school, no less,
so it's quite a step up.

18:53.899 --> 18:57.099
I dithered a bit,
but I've decided to accept.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.379
Because she gets insulted
when she comes here.

18:59.459 --> 19:03.459
I am sure Miss Bunting is given
the reception she deserves.

19:03.539 --> 19:05.579
Mrs Patmore...

19:05.659 --> 19:09.899
Don't let Daisy give up her studies.
She's got potential.

19:09.979 --> 19:12.139
What's going on here?
All sorts.

19:12.219 --> 19:16.099
Mr Carson's giving me investment advice
and Miss Bunting's leaving Downton,

19:16.179 --> 19:18.459
because Mr Branson
won't stick up for her.

19:18.539 --> 19:20.539
Well, that seems to cover it.

19:21.699 --> 19:23.939
I'll be in my room.

19:24.019 --> 19:28.219
Well, goodbye... and good luck.

19:30.339 --> 19:32.339
Goodbye.

19:35.459 --> 19:39.459
Ah, Mrs Hughes.
Who is this Mr Vyner?

19:40.539 --> 19:44.259
He's the London detective,
looking into the death of Mr Green.

19:45.259 --> 19:47.939
Why do they keep questioning
Mr and Mrs Bates?

19:48.019 --> 19:49.619
Who says they do?

19:49.699 --> 19:51.659
This house has no secrets.

19:51.739 --> 19:54.379
Then I suggest you ask Mr Vyner.

19:54.459 --> 19:56.419
I may just do that.

19:56.499 --> 19:59.939
Who knows?
I might have something to tell him.

20:00.019 --> 20:01.659
Don't make trouble, Mr Barrow.

20:01.739 --> 20:04.459
Are you saying
I shouldn't do my duty, Mrs Hughes?

20:04.539 --> 20:07.499
No.
I'm asking you not to make trouble.

20:07.579 --> 20:11.019
Are you quite well? You look
as if you could do with a lie down.

20:11.099 --> 20:13.099
Don't worry about me.

20:16.499 --> 20:19.819
Who was that on the telephone?
Simon Bricker.

20:19.899 --> 20:21.779
Oh, God. What did he want?

20:21.859 --> 20:24.099
I shall answer
without commenting on your tone.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.659
He wants the picture photographed
for his book.

20:26.739 --> 20:29.939
When is this? He comes tomorrow and
they take the pictures on Friday.

20:30.019 --> 20:33.139
Well, you know I won't be here.
I've got the dinner in Sheffield.

20:33.219 --> 20:35.779
Since you don't like him,
I don't see that as a drawback.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.699
And Mary's in London.
What difference does that make?

20:38.779 --> 20:41.539
It's not that I dislike him, exactly.

20:41.619 --> 20:43.819
It's that this business
has been dragging on.

20:43.899 --> 20:47.219
Robert, it's a compliment.
By referencing our painting in his book,

20:47.299 --> 20:49.899
he'll increase its value,
maybe by a lot. Is that so bad?

20:49.979 --> 20:51.899
You're not forbidden
from inviting him.

20:51.979 --> 20:54.259
Good, because I already have.

21:01.979 --> 21:03.979
Mr Branson, sir.

21:06.379 --> 21:09.379
Hello, Daisy. What can I do for you?

21:09.459 --> 21:13.299
You can do something for yourself. You're
making the biggest mistake of your life.

21:13.379 --> 21:16.579
Is this Miss Bunting, by any chance?
She's an extraordinary person.

21:16.659 --> 21:18.259
Clever and kind.

21:18.339 --> 21:21.699
She's all of those things.
Then why turn your back on her?

21:21.779 --> 21:23.939
Daisy -
I mean it.

21:24.019 --> 21:27.499
She's leaving tomorrow,
but I know she loves you.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.139
I can tell when she speaks of you.

21:29.219 --> 21:30.899
She's leaving tomorrow? For good?

21:30.979 --> 21:33.459
Won't you stop her?
You're not a Crawley.

21:33.539 --> 21:35.619
You belong with us.

21:35.699 --> 21:37.659
We're the future. They're the past.

21:37.739 --> 21:40.139
Well, I can hear her voice in that.
Daisy?

21:40.219 --> 21:42.259
What are you doing here?

21:42.339 --> 21:45.699
She was checking something
in the dining room. I held her up.

21:45.779 --> 21:47.779
Get back downstairs immediately.

21:50.316 --> 21:52.539
Mr Carson.

21:57.420 --> 22:00.540
Have any of you heard of someone
called Atticus Aldridge?

22:00.620 --> 22:03.380
He sounds like the hero of a novel
by Mrs Humphrey Ward.

22:03.460 --> 22:07.020
I'm not sure. Any more clues?
I met him today. In York.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.140
Marsha George told me his father's
been made Lord Sinderby.

22:10.220 --> 22:12.100
Now, wait a minute. I remember this.

22:12.180 --> 22:16.580
When the title was created, the locals were
furious, but now I can't remember why.

22:16.660 --> 22:20.660
Perhaps because Sinderby's a Yorkshire
village and they'd only just bought a house.

22:20.740 --> 22:24.140
Canningford Grange.
Oh! Have the Wheelers sold up?

22:24.220 --> 22:26.820
You knew that. I told you.
What does My Lord Sinderby do?

22:26.900 --> 22:28.660
Oh, I think he's a banker.

22:28.740 --> 22:31.740
I don't know, really,
but the son's nice.

22:31.820 --> 22:33.940
Oh... nothing like that!

22:35.820 --> 22:38.740
Barrow, are you quite well?

22:38.820 --> 22:41.020
Carson,
have you been over-working him?

22:41.100 --> 22:43.260
Not that I'm aware, Your Ladyship.

22:43.340 --> 22:45.660
Mr Barrow, am I ill-treating you?

22:45.740 --> 22:49.700
You are the soul of kindness,
Mr Carson. Thank you, Mr Barrow.

22:49.780 --> 22:51.540
I'm looking forward to your party.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.780
It's very daring of the Lord
Lieutenant to give a cocktail party.

22:54.860 --> 22:57.140
Carson, what do you think?

22:57.220 --> 23:01.260
Well, I agree with Carson.
It seems very fast to me.

23:01.340 --> 23:04.140
Well, I love cocktail parties.
Me too.

23:04.220 --> 23:08.140
You only have to stay 40 minutes,
instead of sitting for seven courses,

23:08.220 --> 23:12.100
between a deaf landowner
and an even deafer Major General.

23:12.180 --> 23:15.460
Even so, they'll say you're not
doing things 'properly' any more.

23:15.540 --> 23:17.780
Do you care what people think?
Yes.

23:17.860 --> 23:20.660
I accept change,
but I want to navigate it gently.

23:20.740 --> 23:24.460
I don't want to leap into it
and put everyone's backs up.

23:24.540 --> 23:27.740
But why do the rituals, the clothes
and the customs, matter so much?

23:27.820 --> 23:31.180
Because, without them, we would be
like the Wild Men of Borneo.

23:31.260 --> 23:35.620
I disagree. Manners and tradition
are all very well,

23:35.700 --> 23:39.540
but once they start to control us,
they've outlived their usefulness.

23:39.620 --> 23:42.100
Well, there are more important
things to worry about

23:42.180 --> 23:44.980
than whether or not Carson
minds serving cocktails.

23:45.060 --> 23:48.100
Why is Carson in the line of fire?
What's he done wrong?

23:48.180 --> 23:52.500
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Mama.
I've rather a headache.

23:55.420 --> 23:59.620
What was that about? Rosamund,
you spent the afternoon together.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.740
Did Edith say
anything was bothering her?

24:01.820 --> 24:05.220
Oh, she's just very tired.
She'll be fit as a flea tomorrow.

24:14.380 --> 24:17.940
That's nice of you.
I'll just let Mr Carson know.

24:18.020 --> 24:20.500
Oh, could you leave it,
for a moment?

24:20.580 --> 24:23.900
He's given me his view,
about my money.

24:23.980 --> 24:27.180
He says I should put it
into a building firm, WP Moss,

24:27.260 --> 24:30.740
or, if not them, then into some
other building opportunity.

24:30.820 --> 24:34.020
And you don't want to?
It's not that, exactly.

24:34.100 --> 24:35.980
But I don't know about building,

24:36.060 --> 24:39.020
and I don't like to put money
into something I don't understand.

24:39.100 --> 24:42.940
Then why did you ask him?
Because he's a man, I suppose.

24:43.020 --> 24:45.740
I'm not sure
that's a good enough reason.

24:45.820 --> 24:47.660
Nor am I now.

24:47.740 --> 24:50.140
But I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

24:50.220 --> 24:54.740
I wish men worried about our feelings a
quarter as much as we worry about theirs.

24:56.740 --> 24:58.740
You seem very thoughtful.

24:59.820 --> 25:02.580
I'm on the brink of a decision.

25:02.660 --> 25:04.740
I just hope it's the right one.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.780
Well, I won't ask what it's about.

25:06.860 --> 25:11.700
But remember, Tom - make the right
choice for you and not for us.

25:11.780 --> 25:14.580
You know, you're much nicer
than a lot of people realise.

25:14.660 --> 25:16.780
Not always. Good night.

25:16.860 --> 25:18.860
Good night.

25:23.900 --> 25:25.500
I don't know what you mean, Mama.

25:25.580 --> 25:28.100
You question my motives
every time I come here.

25:28.180 --> 25:29.940
It's as if I weren't welcome.

25:30.020 --> 25:34.260
Just tell me: what were you and Edith
discussing in such a huddle?

25:34.340 --> 25:36.820
Well, it is very hard -

25:36.900 --> 25:41.100
Rosamund, you are addressing
your mother, not the committee
of the Women's Institute.

25:41.180 --> 25:44.660
I'm afraid you've read somewhere
that rudeness in old age is amusing,

25:44.740 --> 25:46.460
which is quite wrong, you know.

25:46.540 --> 25:50.060
It's about the child, isn't it?
That is the secret you share.

25:51.180 --> 25:55.060
We both know you are not leaving
my house until I learn the truth.

25:55.140 --> 25:59.340
So, shall I have a bed made up for you
here, or are you going to tell me now?

26:07.020 --> 26:10.660
Mr Drewe... I have to see her.

26:13.700 --> 26:16.860
It was a mistake
to bring your aunt here.

26:16.940 --> 26:19.980
Margie feels that you want the child
to be your plaything.

26:20.060 --> 26:22.060
How can she say that?

26:23.620 --> 26:26.460
The fact is, I was wrong.

26:26.540 --> 26:29.500
She won't have you here,
not any more.

26:29.580 --> 26:31.140
You must leave us alone.

26:31.220 --> 26:35.260
If you don't stop coming, she'll make
me give up the farm and move away.

26:37.580 --> 26:39.460
But what about Marigold?

26:39.540 --> 26:41.380
What do you mean? We'd take her.

26:41.460 --> 26:43.460
But you can't. I won't allow it.

26:46.020 --> 26:48.260
What would you suggest?

26:48.340 --> 26:51.700
We bring her up to the Abbey
and leave her in the library?

26:51.780 --> 26:54.900
I'm very sorry, m'lady.
It's not what I planned.

26:56.860 --> 26:58.860
But I see no way round it.

27:15.820 --> 27:19.300
People always think how healthy we
must be, living out in the country,

27:19.380 --> 27:21.580
but the water's not as good
as it might be.

27:21.660 --> 27:24.420
You mean the iodine deficiency?
I do.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.300
I suppose you must get
a lot of goitres.

27:26.380 --> 27:28.340
Er... quite a lot, yes.

27:28.420 --> 27:31.860
It's sad so few people know
that the treatment is just iodine.

27:31.940 --> 27:34.060
Too many suffer
when the solution is simple.

27:34.140 --> 27:36.900
You've studied this?
I've just read a lot.

27:36.980 --> 27:39.700
I wish I had studied it.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.420
Luncheon is served, m'lady.

27:43.500 --> 27:46.020
Do cheer up, Spratt.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.940
Spratt is downcast,
because it is as I feared.

27:49.020 --> 27:51.780
Collins has handed in her notice.

27:51.860 --> 27:55.140
You don't like change, Spratt?
I detest it, madam.

27:55.220 --> 27:57.140
Well, we all hate change, Spratt,

27:57.220 --> 27:59.300
but we have to learn to live with it.

27:59.380 --> 28:01.780
I don't hate change.
I find it exciting.

28:01.860 --> 28:05.900
Remember - those customs
and ceremonies that people think
are the soul of England

28:05.980 --> 28:08.100
were almost all invented
by the Victorians.

28:08.180 --> 28:10.100
Quite right.

28:10.180 --> 28:13.900
The truth is, they're well suited,
whether we like it or not.

28:13.980 --> 28:16.900
And I don't believe he's faking
his interest in medicine.

28:16.980 --> 28:18.980
I'm afraid I agree with you.

28:21.020 --> 28:22.700
You must be off soon.

28:22.780 --> 28:26.060
I'm just going to put him
in his uniform, and then we'll go.

28:28.300 --> 28:31.420
You never told me
what the Inspector wanted yesterday.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.420
Mainly because I'm not sure.

28:36.220 --> 28:39.860
He asked me if I liked Mr Green
and why he didn't like you.

28:39.940 --> 28:42.460
And what did you say?

28:42.540 --> 28:44.860
I said I don't know, because I don't.

28:49.180 --> 28:51.180
I promise you this.

28:52.660 --> 28:55.460
Nothing bad is ever going to happen
to you again.

28:57.020 --> 29:00.500
I hope that's true.
We'll sit by the fire,

29:00.580 --> 29:03.500
with all our children around us,

29:03.580 --> 29:05.940
and I'll make certain
that you are safe.

29:07.300 --> 29:09.340
I wonder.

29:09.420 --> 29:13.580
We both want it so much, but do you
believe it'll really happen?

29:13.660 --> 29:16.100
I do. With all my heart.

29:19.580 --> 29:23.700
Actually, I'm not sure about having
children 'all around us'.

29:25.060 --> 29:28.380
How many are you planning on,
Mr Bates?

29:42.060 --> 29:45.140
You nearly missed me.
You never told me you were going.

29:45.220 --> 29:48.500
Who did?
Daisy.

29:48.580 --> 29:50.740
My champion.

29:50.820 --> 29:53.340
The school must be sorry.
Maybe.

29:53.420 --> 29:57.140
I think I was rather a nuisance,
but I hope they'll miss me a bit.

29:58.660 --> 30:01.420
I hope you'll miss me a bit.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.500
I'll miss you a lot.

30:04.900 --> 30:06.900
I've loved you, you know.

30:08.660 --> 30:11.060
I could have loved you more
if you'd let me.

30:12.900 --> 30:15.180
I'm glad we met.

30:15.260 --> 30:17.980
You've reminded me of who I am,
and I'm grateful.

30:19.180 --> 30:21.300
And I won't lose touch with that
again.

30:27.740 --> 30:31.380
But I wish we'd met
before you ever knew them.

30:33.260 --> 30:36.300
We need to get started, if you're
to catch the four o'clock, miss.

30:36.380 --> 30:38.380
Let me.

31:06.980 --> 31:09.500
Did you have a nice journey?
Excellent.

31:09.580 --> 31:11.580
Thank you very much.

31:19.820 --> 31:22.260
Hello, Lord Grantham.
You look very splendid.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.780
We're ships that pass in the night,
Mr Bricker.

31:24.860 --> 31:27.420
I have to go to Sheffield,
but I'll see you tomorrow,

31:27.500 --> 31:29.180
if you're still here when I get back.

31:29.260 --> 31:31.260
Goodbye, Cora.

31:36.180 --> 31:39.140
So, here we are again.

31:39.220 --> 31:41.940
I'm beginning to find Downton
quite home-like.

31:42.020 --> 31:44.460
Good. You're very welcome.

31:45.540 --> 31:47.540
As long as you behave.

32:06.900 --> 32:09.140
What are you doing here?

32:09.220 --> 32:11.540
In search of more cake?

32:11.620 --> 32:16.100
I wanted to see you again,
before I went up to London
to start my new job at the bank.

32:16.180 --> 32:19.540
Do you think I should buy
a bowler hat?

32:19.620 --> 32:25.100
Let me introduce you. Prince Kuragin,
Count Rostov, this is Mr Aldridge.

32:25.180 --> 32:27.340
I'm Mr Kuragin here.

32:29.460 --> 32:33.420
Have you heard from Aunt Violet yet?
Even if your father finds her,

32:33.500 --> 32:35.860
what happens next? To any of us.

32:35.940 --> 32:39.020
We are strangers in a strange land.

32:39.100 --> 32:41.580
Talk to Mr Aldridge.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.380
His family were Russian,

32:43.460 --> 32:47.020
but they've started a new life
in England, and so can you.

32:47.100 --> 32:49.780
Where did they come from?

32:49.860 --> 32:51.860
Odessa.

32:51.940 --> 32:55.420
His great-grandfather
came with some of them in 1859.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.580
See? I do remember what I'm told.

32:57.660 --> 33:01.180
And then the rest of the family
followed in - 1871.

33:01.260 --> 33:03.620
How brilliant! That's right.

33:05.700 --> 33:08.460
He is not Russian.
Nikolai. Nye nado.

33:08.540 --> 33:10.860
No, he's not Russian now, but -

33:10.940 --> 33:13.100
They were not Russian then!

33:14.860 --> 33:17.020
I'm sorry about that.

33:17.100 --> 33:18.940
Nikolai, podozhdi!

33:20.420 --> 33:23.300
I don't understand.

33:23.380 --> 33:26.740
Erm...
I think he said we're not Russian,

33:26.820 --> 33:29.860
because we're... we're Jewish.

33:31.980 --> 33:34.500
Well, how did he know?

33:34.580 --> 33:39.180
There were two big pogroms to drive out
the Jews from Odessa, one in 1859...

33:39.260 --> 33:41.260
And 1871?

33:42.660 --> 33:44.540
But it's still odd.

33:44.620 --> 33:47.460
I mean, you're English now,
but you're still Jewish.

33:47.540 --> 33:49.540
What's the difference?

33:53.980 --> 33:57.060
Would you let me give you dinner
when you're in London?

33:58.460 --> 34:00.940
I might.

34:01.020 --> 34:03.020
We'll have to see.

34:07.140 --> 34:10.020
What a treat. I haven't been
to Simpson's for ages.

34:10.100 --> 34:11.699
We'll go straight to the table.

34:11.780 --> 34:14.420
I've asked a friend to join us,
and I want you to behave.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.500
Why wouldn't I?

34:22.860 --> 34:26.020
Goodness. I wasn't expecting you.

34:26.100 --> 34:28.780
Ditto.
I, happily, was expecting you both.

34:31.260 --> 34:35.460
What is your scheme? That we now hold hands
and take a house by the sea together?

34:35.540 --> 34:38.739
Not quite.
But I have an idea that may be,

34:38.820 --> 34:42.580
as The Times advertisements say,
'to your mutual advantage'.

34:47.659 --> 34:50.260
You've got to stop this.
You're poisoning yourself.

34:50.340 --> 34:52.219
Just lay off.

34:52.300 --> 34:55.300
Look at you. Sweating like a beast.

34:55.380 --> 34:59.780
Just because Her Ladyship let you stay,
you think you can boss us all around.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.980
Forgot the cream.

35:02.060 --> 35:07.700
Oh, Miss Baxter, you may not think
I have the right to ask,

35:07.780 --> 35:14.220
but now that Her Ladyship knows
the truth, might you tell me?

35:15.340 --> 35:16.820
If you really want me to.

35:16.900 --> 35:20.820
Mr Molesley! Now.
Yes, Mr Carson. Right away.

35:20.900 --> 35:23.340
I don't think
I can be hearing this correctly.

35:23.420 --> 35:24.940
No?
No.

35:25.020 --> 35:29.020
You seem to suggest I should take the
discarded leavings of Lady Mary Crawley,

35:29.100 --> 35:31.940
dust off the fluff
and put them on my own plate.

35:32.020 --> 35:34.500
That's not what Charles meant.
Isn't it?

35:34.580 --> 35:37.620
Good. What a relief.
Now we won't have to quarrel.

35:37.700 --> 35:41.060
Mabel, you're in love with Tony
Gillingham. You know you are.

35:41.140 --> 35:44.660
All I know is that Tony
broke off our engagement,
which I had not deserved,

35:44.740 --> 35:47.100
because Mary
crooked her little finger at him.

35:47.180 --> 35:49.700
It was his choice, not mine.
So you say.

35:49.780 --> 35:52.500
But now you're bored.
You want someone else to play with.

35:52.580 --> 35:55.700
So, to dry his tears and keep him
occupied, you toss him back to me.

35:55.780 --> 35:58.700
This isn't my idea.
Well, it certainly isn't mine.

35:58.780 --> 36:01.620
You know, you're cutting off
your nose to spite your face.

36:01.700 --> 36:04.980
I'm going. Well, what shall we do
with your food?

36:05.060 --> 36:07.060
Eat it, and I hope it chokes you.

36:10.300 --> 36:13.220
That was a big success
What's your next suggestion?

36:13.300 --> 36:16.700
No, I don't think we need another plan.
This was just a scene we had to play.

36:16.780 --> 36:19.020
Can you put the fricassee there?
We'll share it.

36:19.100 --> 36:22.380
Now, I'd like my beef pink,
but not raw.

36:27.518 --> 36:30.078
You didn't linger very long
over your Port.

36:30.158 --> 36:33.478
Because we'd both rather be
with the ladies.

36:33.558 --> 36:36.718
Edith, dear. There's something
I'd like to show you in the library.

36:36.798 --> 36:39.398
What's that, Granny?
Oh, it's just a particular book

36:39.478 --> 36:41.318
you might find interesting.

36:41.398 --> 36:43.638
How is your fiery friend,
Miss Bunting?

36:43.718 --> 36:46.038
I notice we don't see her here
as much as we used to.

36:46.118 --> 36:48.758
Do you wonder at it? Well,
it's good to be disagreed with.

36:48.838 --> 36:50.358
Keeps you on your toes.

36:50.438 --> 36:54.878
Then Lord Grantham must have been
on points from the moment
she walked through the door.

36:54.958 --> 36:56.958
I hope you haven't broken with her.

36:58.398 --> 37:00.918
She's gone. She left today.

37:00.998 --> 37:02.998
Oh, I am sorry.

37:04.238 --> 37:07.038
What about you, Rose? What happened
to the young man you met?

37:07.118 --> 37:10.198
He's gone too.
He's starting a new job in London.

37:10.278 --> 37:13.598
Oh, dear. What a sad conversation.

37:13.678 --> 37:15.638
He was interesting.

37:15.718 --> 37:20.238
He wasn't just the same old chap
one's supposed to dance with.
His family was unusual.

37:20.318 --> 37:23.838
In what way? They came here
from Odessa. 60 years ago.

37:23.918 --> 37:26.638
They were driven out by the pogroms,
but they've done well.

37:26.718 --> 37:30.238
Well, yes, that is interesting.

37:30.318 --> 37:33.238
I didn't tell you because I knew
you'd think it was a mistake.

37:33.318 --> 37:36.558
I suppose it never occurred to you
that I might be right?

37:36.638 --> 37:39.038
What do you expect me to do?
Send her back?

37:39.118 --> 37:41.998
It's too late. We can't get
the child back to Switzerland,

37:42.078 --> 37:44.238
and there's no point
in keeping her here.

37:44.318 --> 37:46.278
What do you mean?
That woman, Mrs...

37:46.358 --> 37:49.958
Drewe. Mrs Drewe. Well,
she's at the point of explosion.

37:50.038 --> 37:51.798
We must get the child away.

37:51.878 --> 37:54.318
But where would we go?

37:54.398 --> 37:56.398
Not 'we', my dear.

37:57.398 --> 38:00.878
There are schools that will take
children from any age.

38:00.958 --> 38:04.078
We'll find one in France where
she'll be properly looked after.

38:04.158 --> 38:08.398
I dare say you can even visit,
as long as you never reveal who you are.

38:08.478 --> 38:11.638
It'll be... quite manageable.

38:11.718 --> 38:15.478
And you agree with this, Granny?
Well, I know it sounds very harsh.

38:15.558 --> 38:18.998
But what else are we to do?

38:19.078 --> 38:21.238
We're going up.

38:21.318 --> 38:23.878
Mama, the car's ready
whenever you want it.

38:23.958 --> 38:25.918
Oh, thank you, Cora.

38:25.998 --> 38:27.998
Good night.

38:30.718 --> 38:33.078
We'll settle the details later.

38:33.158 --> 38:35.998
But I promise you -
this is for the best.

38:43.758 --> 38:47.318
Well, in my eyes,
that makes you innocent.

38:47.398 --> 38:52.438
It makes you a victim of the crime,
quite as much as Mrs Benton.

38:52.518 --> 38:54.238
Why didn't you tell me this before?

38:54.318 --> 38:57.918
Because I knew you'd say it proved my
innocence, when it does no such thing.

38:57.998 --> 39:00.118
I'd rather not hide from the truth,
thank you.

39:00.198 --> 39:04.718
Don't hide, then. But don't punish
yourself for ever, either.

39:04.798 --> 39:06.638
No. But I have learned.

39:06.718 --> 39:08.958
And I won't ever be controlled again.

39:11.358 --> 39:13.358
I must go.

39:15.678 --> 39:18.678
Mr Barrow said you wanted me.
Oh, come in and sit down.

39:21.638 --> 39:24.998
Mrs Patmore's got something to say.
What's that?

39:25.078 --> 39:28.318
Oh, just how grateful I am
for your excellent advice.

39:28.398 --> 39:31.478
Oh, you've taken it, then?
I have. In a way.

39:31.558 --> 39:34.038
You've invested in building?

39:34.118 --> 39:37.438
Well, she's invested in a building,
yes.

39:37.518 --> 39:40.598
I've found a cottage
in Haughton-le-Skerne,

39:40.678 --> 39:42.878
and I'm going to see it on Tuesday.

39:42.958 --> 39:47.678
It's £300, so it's a big decision,
but you've given me the courage.

39:47.758 --> 39:49.718
Oh, that's not what I meant at all.

39:49.798 --> 39:53.278
I thought you wanted to be in the
market, to increase your capital.

39:53.358 --> 39:59.238
Well, I'll rent it now and later
I thought I'd take in some lodgers.
It's got three bedrooms.

39:59.318 --> 40:01.158
Oh, this is very small beer.

40:01.238 --> 40:05.638
Mr Carson, it's my kind of beer,
and I know how to drink it.

40:05.718 --> 40:09.478
But you gave her the idea,
didn't you? She's very grateful.

40:09.558 --> 40:14.278
Oh, I am. It's good to hear advice
from a man of the world.

40:14.358 --> 40:17.398
Well, I like to do what I can.

40:17.478 --> 40:19.478
We feel thoroughly protected.

40:38.518 --> 40:40.958
Have you forgotten something?

40:41.038 --> 40:43.518
It's not your maid.

40:43.598 --> 40:45.838
I waited till she'd gone.

40:45.918 --> 40:47.718
You must leave.

40:47.798 --> 40:50.478
Mr Bricker, you must leave.

40:50.558 --> 40:53.158
I hope I didn't wake you.
No, not at all, m'lord.

40:53.238 --> 40:57.078
Miss Baxter's only just come down,
so Her Ladyship will still be awake.

40:57.158 --> 40:59.758
Mr Bricker, I've asked you twice
now. Will you please go?

40:59.838 --> 41:02.358
You said yourself -
who knows when I'll be back?

41:02.438 --> 41:04.118
Mr Bricker -
Don't pretend, Cora.

41:04.198 --> 41:08.198
You know something's happened between us.
You know things have changed now.

41:08.278 --> 41:10.278
I feel it and I know you do.

41:17.158 --> 41:20.198
When did someone last cherish you?

41:21.318 --> 41:23.318
When did someone even listen to you?

41:23.398 --> 41:26.358
I've seen you with your family,
ignored and passed over.

41:26.438 --> 41:29.318
None of this is any -
I'm glad you're still awake...

41:36.678 --> 41:39.438
The dinner was over early.
It seemed easier to come back.

41:39.518 --> 41:41.558
I'm sorry if it's a disappointment.

41:41.638 --> 41:45.038
It isn't.
Mr Bricker was just leaving.

41:45.118 --> 41:47.238
I'm not here at Lady Grantham's
invitation.

41:47.318 --> 41:49.918
Then will you please leave at mine?

41:54.518 --> 41:56.278
Robert, let him go.

41:56.358 --> 41:58.558
You can't be surprised.

41:58.638 --> 42:00.798
When you chose
to ignore a woman like Cora,

42:00.878 --> 42:04.198
you must have known not every man
would be as blind as you.

42:06.918 --> 42:09.638
Stop it!

42:09.718 --> 42:11.718
Stop it! Stop it!

42:13.598 --> 42:16.318
Stop!

42:16.398 --> 42:18.438
Mama?

42:18.518 --> 42:22.038
Mama? Papa?
Is everything all right in there?

42:25.918 --> 42:29.918
I'm so sorry, darling. Your father and I
were just playing a stupid game

42:29.998 --> 42:31.638
and we knocked over a lamp.

42:31.718 --> 42:34.958
Oh. If you're sure.
I'm sure, poppet.

42:35.038 --> 42:37.038
Good night. Sleep tight.

42:42.438 --> 42:44.598
I think that is my exit too.
Wait.

42:57.038 --> 42:59.958
Golly. What a night.

43:01.118 --> 43:03.118
I'll sleep in my dressing room.

43:07.838 --> 43:12.118
Eat a proper breakfast and lunch. There won't
be time for more than a cup of tea later.

43:12.198 --> 43:13.678
I'll try to make it up.

43:13.758 --> 43:17.678
When you've finished your duties,
I'd appreciate any help you can give.

43:17.758 --> 43:19.358
We'll clear the hall now.

43:19.438 --> 43:21.558
But why aren't we giving
a proper dinner here?

43:21.638 --> 43:23.518
I quite agree, Mrs Patmore.

43:23.598 --> 43:26.278
Mrs Hughes would say
we must move with the times.

43:26.358 --> 43:28.358
Yes. I would.

43:30.798 --> 43:33.118
Do you have a bandage I can have?

43:33.198 --> 43:35.598
Have you hurt yourself?
I haven't, no.

43:35.678 --> 43:38.998
Mrs Bates, have you heard any more
from that policeman?

43:39.078 --> 43:41.798
No.

43:41.878 --> 43:43.998
Here we go. That's Lady Mary.

43:44.078 --> 43:45.958
Do you think you will?

43:46.038 --> 43:48.518
No. I hope not, anyway.

43:50.918 --> 43:52.838
Why do you pester her with this?

43:52.918 --> 43:54.918
Because I feel like it.

43:56.278 --> 43:58.438
Mr Barrow. Upstairs, please.

43:58.518 --> 44:00.518
You too, Mr Molesley.

44:23.158 --> 44:26.438
The car is waiting, sir.
Your case is inside it.

44:26.518 --> 44:28.518
Thank you, Carson.

44:32.918 --> 44:34.918
Thank you.

45:03.558 --> 45:06.838
The Lady Beaumont.
The Lord Howard of Glossop.

45:06.918 --> 45:09.358
Lovely to see you.
Good evening.

45:09.438 --> 45:12.158
Howard.
Lord Grantham.

45:12.238 --> 45:14.238
I'd forgotten his father had died.

45:20.118 --> 45:22.118
Thank you, Barrow.

45:23.238 --> 45:24.478
Oh, thank you.

45:24.558 --> 45:27.798
My dear,
we can't leave things as they are.

45:27.878 --> 45:30.958
It's a tinderbox.
It could go up at any moment.

45:31.038 --> 45:32.798
Granny, if I was to take her
to London -

45:32.878 --> 45:35.758
Oh, don't be ridiculous, my darling.
Think.

45:35.838 --> 45:38.038
All I'm saying is,
there must be another way.

45:38.118 --> 45:39.438
Well, how can there be?

45:39.518 --> 45:43.238
Mrs Reginald Crawley
and the Lord Merton.

45:44.518 --> 45:47.838
Hello, Isobel.
It's cousin Isobel.

45:47.918 --> 45:49.918
And her follower.

45:51.358 --> 45:53.638
The Earl and Countess of Woolton.

45:53.718 --> 45:56.918
I'm fine. May I sit down?
Are you tired?

45:56.998 --> 46:00.518
No, but I rather foolishly twisted
my ankle getting out of the car.

46:00.598 --> 46:04.958
Oh, dear. Be careful - Lord Merton
will have you on the operating table

46:05.038 --> 46:07.478
before you can say 'knife'.

46:07.558 --> 46:09.358
What about Lady Ingleby's pearls?

46:09.438 --> 46:12.758
I was so jealous, I wanted
to snatch them off her throat!

46:15.158 --> 46:17.638
Sir Henry and Lady Lawson.

46:19.718 --> 46:22.358
Well, that's that.

46:22.438 --> 46:24.518
And you're back at your books,
I see.

46:24.598 --> 46:26.518
I'm not giving up -
don't think I will.

46:26.598 --> 46:28.398
And I wouldn't want you to.

46:28.478 --> 46:30.758
Right, I'm going up.
Don't forget the light.

46:30.838 --> 46:34.078
Oh, gracious! Good evening, m'lady.

46:34.158 --> 46:37.878
I didn't expect to see you down here.
Mr Carson said you'd all gone to bed.

46:37.958 --> 46:40.878
I wanted to make a telephone call
without...

46:40.958 --> 46:43.078
I wanted to make a private call.

46:43.158 --> 46:45.238
And you thought
you'd use Mr Carson's phone?

46:45.318 --> 46:48.038
I don't think he'd mind. Do you?
I'm sure he wouldn't.

46:48.118 --> 46:50.358
Well, I'll leave you to it.
Good night, m'lady.

46:50.438 --> 46:52.438
Good night.

47:05.838 --> 47:08.038
I'd like to make a trunk call
to London.

47:11.358 --> 47:14.878
The York & Ainsty are holding
a point-to-point at Canningford Grange.

47:14.958 --> 47:16.958
Can you see Aunt Mary?

47:18.038 --> 47:21.398
You were always asking if I need help.
Well, now's your chance. Help me.

47:21.478 --> 47:24.478
If I talk to anyone, it'll be you.
Then talk to me. Please.

47:24.558 --> 47:26.838
You're losing your sense
of the appropriate.

47:26.918 --> 47:28.958
You're losing your sense of occasion.

47:29.038 --> 47:30.452
You think I'm a murderer.

47:30.452 --> 47:31.286
