WEBVTT

00:01.751 --> 00:02.826
They found this steamship.

00:02.919 --> 00:04.503
NARRATOR:
on<i> Beyond Oak Island...</i>

00:04.662 --> 00:06.329
You're used to digging
for treasures on islands.

00:06.414 --> 00:08.507
We find ours in the middle
of cornfields.

00:08.666 --> 00:10.175
How do you find a steamboat
in a cornfield?

00:10.334 --> 00:12.428
MATTY: I didn't understand the
magnitude of what he had done

00:12.512 --> 00:13.929
until I stepped foot
in the museum.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.255
You're pretty sure it's here?

00:15.339 --> 00:16.089
We're absolutely sure it's here.

00:16.182 --> 00:17.007
How can you say that?

00:17.091 --> 00:18.175
You got to go down into the boat

00:18.259 --> 00:20.269
and bring something
to the surface.

00:20.428 --> 00:23.096
Holy moly! Oh, look at this!

00:23.189 --> 00:25.357
- Oh, my.
- No way!

00:25.442 --> 00:28.935
- There it is!
- All right, we got us a genuine Missouri steamboat!

00:29.029 --> 00:30.446
Yeah!

00:32.949 --> 00:34.616
All the while
we were growing up,

00:34.701 --> 00:37.703
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:39.039 --> 00:39.872
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:39.956 --> 00:41.531
cursed treasure.

00:41.616 --> 00:43.542
Civil War gold.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.369
- (laughter) - Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:46.454 --> 00:48.630
has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:48.715 --> 00:51.625
- Whoa.
- waiting to be explored.

00:51.709 --> 00:54.544
RICK: So, we like to reach
out to other treasure hunters.

00:54.629 --> 00:56.797
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.132
- MARTY: We want to hear their stories...
- That's right.

00:59.217 --> 01:01.551
- and share our insights.
- "Ill-gotten gains."

01:01.636 --> 01:03.053
- RICK: And who knows...
- GARY: I got it.

01:03.137 --> 01:04.805
maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.473
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.225
Wow. That is gold.

01:08.309 --> 01:10.143
- RICK: But all over the world.
- Yeah!

01:10.236 --> 01:11.737
MARTY:
<i>Beyond Oak Island.</i>

01:21.748 --> 01:24.491
Matty Blake!
Off on another adventure.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.169
-I love it, Marty. On the road again with my pal.
-Yeah.

01:27.328 --> 01:31.331
NARRATOR: In Kansas City,
Missouri, Marty Lagina and Matty Blake

01:31.424 --> 01:33.175
are on their way to meet

01:33.259 --> 01:35.752
with a treasure hunter named
David Hawley,

01:35.837 --> 01:38.088
who has made a career
out of recovering

01:38.181 --> 01:41.100
the wrecks of 19th century
steamboats.

01:41.259 --> 01:44.686
David's museum, it's got
the artifacts from the<i> Arabia,</i>

01:44.771 --> 01:47.180
the steamship that
he found and recovered.

01:47.265 --> 01:49.108
I mean, this guy is
fascinating, Marty.

01:49.192 --> 01:53.270
MARTY: You know, the whole
history of steamboats in general

01:53.363 --> 01:55.355
is kind of an underreported
part of history--

01:55.439 --> 01:59.785
You know, American history--
Industrial Revolution stuff.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.696
Yeah. I remember one historian
say, you know, manifest destiny

02:02.789 --> 02:04.123
as we think about it,

02:04.207 --> 02:06.291
the expansion into the West
would not have happened

02:06.450 --> 02:08.869
as it did when it did if it
wasn't for these steamships,

02:08.953 --> 02:11.880
so it's a huge part
of American history.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.801
NARRATOR: When the United
States made the Louisiana Purchase

02:15.960 --> 02:20.964
from France for an estimated
$15 million in 1803,

02:21.057 --> 02:25.468
the nation was nearly
doubled in size.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.480
Between military
fortifications and a rush

02:28.565 --> 02:32.401
of pioneering settlers into
the new American frontier,

02:32.485 --> 02:36.313
the need to ship goods
and services up and down

02:36.406 --> 02:39.158
the Mississippi River
and beyond gave rise to

02:39.317 --> 02:42.244
a new method of mass
distribution and transportation:

02:42.328 --> 02:45.655
the steamboat.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.749
A steamboat had its own
method of propulsion,

02:47.834 --> 02:50.502
and was able to move up
the river without,

02:50.661 --> 02:53.330
without the assistance
of having someone pull it

02:53.423 --> 02:55.415
or pole it or anything
like that.

02:55.499 --> 02:58.919
The engine was powerful
enough to carry

02:59.003 --> 03:00.837
substantial amounts of cargo

03:00.930 --> 03:04.183
and large numbers of passengers.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.677
The steamboat was part
of a transportation revolution.

03:07.762 --> 03:11.023
The ability to move people
and goods

03:11.107 --> 03:15.194
far more quickly than
ever before, and shrink

03:15.353 --> 03:18.271
people's perception
and experience of the world.

03:18.356 --> 03:21.358
It connects folks
across vast distances.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.527
And so it is
because of the steamboat

03:24.612 --> 03:27.697
that this vast country
which we inhabit today

03:27.790 --> 03:29.708
begins to feel
more like a nation.

03:29.792 --> 03:33.295
ERWIN: Steamboat
travel could be dangerous.

03:33.454 --> 03:37.049
A boat that struck a snag could
sink in as little as a minute.

03:37.208 --> 03:41.470
The next most common cause
of disasters was fire.

03:41.629 --> 03:45.131
Boats were wooden, they had
open fires in the fire box.

03:45.216 --> 03:47.467
The average life span
of the steamboats

03:47.560 --> 03:50.229
on the Mississippi River
was around five or six years.

03:50.388 --> 03:53.315
On the Missouri River,
it was about three years.

03:53.399 --> 03:57.811
NARRATOR: By the 1870s,
when the expansion of railroads

03:57.895 --> 04:00.239
would replace riverboats for
commerce and transportation

04:00.398 --> 04:02.399
in the U.S.,

04:02.492 --> 04:04.743
more than 400
shipwrecks had occurred

04:04.902 --> 04:07.496
between the Mississippi
and Missouri Rivers.

04:07.655 --> 04:11.375
And many of their precious
cargoes were lost to history.

04:12.576 --> 04:14.661
Oh, and there it is.

04:14.745 --> 04:17.163
Treasures of the Steamboat
<i>Arabia</i> Museum,

04:17.248 --> 04:18.757
- right there, Marty.
- It's pretty impressive.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.417
MATTY:
Sure is.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.844
NARRATOR:
Matty and Marty have arrived

04:23.004 --> 04:25.088
at the<i> Arabia</i> Steamboat Museum

04:25.172 --> 04:28.091
to meet with its owner
David Hawley and his son Matt.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.851
Welcome to Kansas City.
I'm Dave.

04:29.936 --> 04:30.852
- Thank you. - Matty Blake.
- Nice to meet you, Matty.

04:31.012 --> 04:32.095
NARRATOR:
The Laginas have agreed

04:32.179 --> 04:34.264
to offer both help
and resources to David

04:34.357 --> 04:36.599
and his team as
they attempt to locate

04:36.693 --> 04:38.694
two historic steamboat wrecks,

04:38.778 --> 04:40.696
both of which were known
to have been carrying

04:40.855 --> 04:42.531
millions in valuable cargo.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.950
Well, see, you're used
to digging for treasures

04:45.109 --> 04:46.118
on islands and such.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.611
We find ours in
the middle of cornfields.

04:48.696 --> 04:51.039
Which is the, which is
the first amazing thing to me.

04:51.198 --> 04:53.033
I just got to say this, I mean,

04:53.117 --> 04:54.960
when Matty first told us
about this,

04:55.119 --> 04:58.297
I said, "Wait, how would he find
a steamboat in a cornfield?"

04:58.381 --> 05:00.299
-You know what I mean? It's not intuitive, all right?
-Yeah. No, no.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.134
It's not where you go first
to look for treasure, right?

05:02.293 --> 05:03.543
I know.

05:03.627 --> 05:07.547
NARRATOR: Born and raised
in Kansas City, Missouri,

05:07.640 --> 05:11.051
David Hawley grew up in a family
that shared a fascination

05:11.144 --> 05:14.896
for both riverboats and their
impact on American history.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.898
I was born into a family
of heating

05:17.058 --> 05:18.391
and air conditioning repairmen.

05:18.484 --> 05:21.236
On a service call, years
and years ago, I met a fellow

05:21.321 --> 05:25.231
that looked for flying saucers
and Bigfoot and steamboats.

05:25.316 --> 05:27.492
And I wasn't much interested
in the Bigfoot or the flying

05:27.577 --> 05:31.246
saucers, but the steamboats
interested me, and so,

05:31.331 --> 05:34.741
in researching steamboats,
there was a lot to choose from.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.085
Hundreds of these boats sank.

05:37.244 --> 05:41.089
But the<i> Arabia</i> was one that
sank close to Kansas City.

05:43.334 --> 05:46.762
NARRATOR:
On September 5, 1856,

05:46.921 --> 05:50.256
the steamboat<i> Arabia</i> was making
its way up the Missouri River,

05:50.350 --> 05:54.010
loaded with 222 tons of cargo.

05:54.103 --> 05:56.688
Six miles west of Kansas City,

05:56.847 --> 05:59.599
it hit a tree snag that
tore open its hull.

05:59.683 --> 06:03.186
It sank in minutes.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.189
Its cargo went down
with the ship,

06:06.273 --> 06:08.525
and by the next morning
was buried under

06:08.618 --> 06:11.694
layers of the Missouri's
mud and silt.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.622
The river changes
course over time.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.199
I got old river maps to find out

06:16.292 --> 06:19.619
where the river
had once been in 1856.

06:19.712 --> 06:23.039
And what a surprise, it was now
in the middle of a cornfield.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.384
I then, with the farmer's
permission,

06:25.468 --> 06:30.630
went into the field in 1988
and began the search.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.892
Walking back and forth
in a cornfield with a tool,

06:34.051 --> 06:36.136
with a metal detector
called a magnetometer.

06:36.220 --> 06:38.721
We found it
with the metal detector,

06:38.806 --> 06:42.567
and then brought out a drill rig
and began to test-drill.

06:42.726 --> 06:45.404
To see how deep it was
and exactly where it lay.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.573
It took us probably a week
of drilling

06:48.732 --> 06:50.900
to find the sides,
the front and the back.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.486
Then we could chalk it
with white chalk

06:53.571 --> 06:54.737
all the way around the boat.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.999
And for the first time,
there it was.

06:58.159 --> 07:02.003
The<i> Arabia</i> was 171 feet long.

07:02.163 --> 07:03.755
At that point, down we went.

07:04.999 --> 07:07.175
For the excavation
of the<i> Arabia</i> to be successful,

07:07.334 --> 07:09.169
we had to dig it in the winter.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.764
There was big surprises, like
food products that survived.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.016
Pickles and pie fillings
that you could still eat.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.760
Barrels of butter that
still smelled fresh.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.522
There was clothing
of all types, and shoes.

07:20.681 --> 07:23.183
We found 4,000 boots and shoes.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.186
We found cooking utensils
and beautiful sets of dishware.

07:26.279 --> 07:30.356
Guns and knives, and by
the time we'd finished it four

07:30.450 --> 07:34.035
months later, no one was talking
about selling the collection.

07:34.120 --> 07:38.865
We began the excavation
November the 13th of 1988.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.952
The museum opened up
November the 13th of 1991,

07:43.037 --> 07:44.713
three years to the day.

07:44.872 --> 07:46.381
- That is very cool.
- It is.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.625
This-- just this is impressive.

07:48.709 --> 07:51.794
Yeah, yeah, so what you
see here is rebuilt.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.473
What you see there
is the real deal.

07:54.632 --> 07:56.224
- That is incredible.
- The pitman arm,

07:56.309 --> 07:58.477
the structure and the engine.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.970
No kidding.
Very cool.

08:01.055 --> 08:03.482
You know, Dave, what is
your mission going forward?

08:03.641 --> 08:06.151
Momentarily, when we go
into the collection,

08:06.310 --> 08:08.478
you'll see a collection unlike
anything you've ever seen.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.989
And that's one boat,
that's one story.

08:11.148 --> 08:14.484
Eventually, the goal would
be to have six boats,

08:14.577 --> 08:16.244
one from each
decade of river travel,

08:16.403 --> 08:18.663
from the '20s through the '70s.

08:19.990 --> 08:22.492
The<i> Arabia</i> tells a story
of the 1850s

08:22.585 --> 08:24.586
and the settlers coming west.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.254
The boat that we're
going to work on later

08:26.413 --> 08:29.174
is one called the<i> Malta.</i>
Sank in 1841.

08:29.333 --> 08:32.093
Bringing Indian trade
goods to the frontier.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.096
The<i> Radnor,</i>
that we'll look for, another

08:35.181 --> 08:37.682
huge story carrying military
supplies to Fort Leavenworth.

08:37.841 --> 08:40.435
It's not a story
of just steamboats.

08:40.594 --> 08:42.771
It's a story about the
development of the whole West.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.097
And you're gonna learn
some things, aren't you?

08:44.190 --> 08:45.190
You will learn things

08:45.274 --> 08:47.275
like you have never
learned before.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.685
Lead on.

08:48.769 --> 08:50.111
- Show us where to go.
- After you. - Okay.

08:50.271 --> 08:52.364
MATTY: What David has
been able to do with his son Matt

08:52.523 --> 08:56.201
and his team is nothing
short of incredible.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.370
And I didn't understand
the magnitude

08:58.529 --> 09:00.121
of what he had done until
I stepped foot in the museum.

09:00.281 --> 09:02.791
In fact, I literally thought

09:02.875 --> 09:05.961
the upstairs gift shop
part was the museum

09:06.120 --> 09:08.121
until he walked us underground.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.965
We couldn't bring up the whole
boat, so this wood floor

09:10.124 --> 09:11.216
that you're on is the boat.

09:11.375 --> 09:13.301
- This?
- The barrel up there is the front,

09:13.460 --> 09:15.128
this is the back of the boat.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.889
The boilers are where they were.
The wheel is where it was.

09:18.048 --> 09:21.467
- Oh, so we're standing...
- You're standing on the model.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.720
- Wow! So cool!
- Wow, man, did you guys do a great job.

09:23.804 --> 09:26.973
And then, as a river traveler,
that's what Kansas City would

09:27.066 --> 09:29.067
have looked like as you paddled
your way upstream.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.486
I mean, I'm very impressed
that you guys built this.

09:31.645 --> 09:33.980
- Well, you get a real good idea of scale right here, right?
- Yes.

09:34.064 --> 09:35.815
- I mean, this is the boat.
- Yeah, it is.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.068
Let's stroll the deck,
shall we, gentlemen?

09:39.161 --> 09:41.237
You walk about
a football field length

09:41.330 --> 09:44.574
of artifacts that
are perfectly preserved.

09:44.658 --> 09:46.918
It's stunning.
It's like nothing I've

09:47.077 --> 09:48.336
ever seen in my life.
And, you know,

09:48.421 --> 09:50.255
it gives a whole
new definition to

09:50.339 --> 09:51.497
the term treasure, really.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.841
MARTY:
Where are we going next?

09:52.925 --> 09:54.250
DAVID:
We're going into a room

09:54.335 --> 09:56.085
that we call our General Store.

09:56.170 --> 09:58.513
Wow.

09:58.672 --> 10:02.091
Matt, uh, is it fair to say

10:02.184 --> 10:03.351
a lot of the things we've seen

10:03.510 --> 10:04.769
and we've walked by would
have ended up in a store

10:04.928 --> 10:07.522
just like this for sale?
Is that what was happening?

10:07.681 --> 10:08.773
Absolutely.
Yeah, most of the stuff

10:08.932 --> 10:11.109
was going up for general stores
just for resale.

10:11.268 --> 10:13.102
So that's why you see
so many of the same thing.

10:13.187 --> 10:15.355
- That's what I was wondering.
- It was going up for folks for the winter.

10:15.439 --> 10:18.033
They were the 18-wheelers of the
day, just sending stuff up.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.776
And the quality of this stuff,
I mean, we're talking about

10:19.869 --> 10:21.286
the frontier right
at this point.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.954
But people still
want quality, and they're

10:23.039 --> 10:24.539
- still willing to pay for it.
- People were people.

10:24.698 --> 10:25.707
- Yeah.
- They wanted nice things.

10:25.866 --> 10:27.375
And they would import them,

10:27.534 --> 10:29.044
if not from the States,
from Europe.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.371
Yeah, like those plates,
where are those from?

10:31.455 --> 10:32.547
Exactly.
They came from England.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.715
From England?
Yeah, that would make sense.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.884
They had to be carrying alcohol.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.218
Did you find anything like that?

10:37.378 --> 10:40.138
In the boat, downstairs in
the cargo hold, trapped,

10:40.222 --> 10:44.476
filled with mud and water,
were cases of champagnes

10:44.635 --> 10:47.053
- and cognac and gin, like you see over there.
- Wow!

10:47.146 --> 10:50.139
Well, I'll tell you what, guys.
I have, I have treasure envy.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.399
(laughter)

10:51.484 --> 10:52.484
Coming from you,

10:52.568 --> 10:53.976
- that's a compliment.
- Yeah, well...

10:54.070 --> 10:56.062
- That is awesome.
- It's spectacular.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.398
You had to resist the urge
to sell some of this stuff.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.659
- You know, we've never had that.
- You never had it?

11:00.818 --> 11:02.160
No, we've never had the thought,
"Let's sell a boot!"

11:02.244 --> 11:03.569
(laughter)

11:03.654 --> 11:04.987
Well, those plates up there!

11:05.072 --> 11:06.155
We're all kind of attached
to this stuff.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.491
It's like our
little children, you know?

11:08.584 --> 11:09.909
I absolutely applaud you for it.

11:09.993 --> 11:12.412
But have you ever
had it evaluated?

11:12.496 --> 11:14.414
- Has anybody came up with a number and said...?
- Oh, sure.

11:14.498 --> 11:16.082
It's worth millions
and millions of dollars.

11:16.166 --> 11:18.259
- The collection itself.
- It has to be. Yeah.

11:18.419 --> 11:22.004
- Yeah.
- Well, you got real treasure and you got real history here.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.765
But there's the<i> Malta.</i>
You mentioned the<i> Malta,</i>

11:23.849 --> 11:26.434
- and the<i> Malta</i> is on dry land.
- Is on dry land.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.269
Tell us about that.
What's on the agenda?

11:28.354 --> 11:30.346
So basically,
we found the boat once already,

11:30.439 --> 11:31.523
but the Missouri
is known for flooding.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.266
It happened several times.

11:33.350 --> 11:34.517
All of our markers are gone.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.436
- Ah.
- The outline is gone.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.855
So, we know where the boiler is.

11:38.939 --> 11:41.274
We know where that hot spot is,
but before you can dig,

11:41.367 --> 11:42.692
you've got to get an outline,
you have to know where--

11:42.785 --> 11:44.610
How the boat is sitting
in the field.

11:44.695 --> 11:46.112
So that's what we've
got to go do today.

11:46.196 --> 11:47.530
So you've got a little rig,
little drill rig, and we're

11:47.623 --> 11:48.781
gonna do--
Just do core sampling?

11:48.866 --> 11:50.032
We're just gonna go down
and tap on that boat.

11:50.117 --> 11:52.210
That sounds like fun.
That's right up my alley.

11:52.294 --> 11:53.119
- All right.
- Let's go do that.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.213
- Let's do it.
- Let's drill.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.971
Well, we're gonna put a drill
in the ground today, Marty.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.380
Well, we're drilling
on something we're

12:04.465 --> 12:07.133
pretty dang sure is there,
so it's gonna be great.

12:07.217 --> 12:09.894
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon,

12:09.979 --> 12:13.648
Marty Lagina and Matty Blake
have traveled some 70 miles east

12:13.733 --> 12:18.069
of Kansas City to Malta Bend,
Missouri, where David Hawley

12:18.154 --> 12:21.740
and his team believe they've
found the location of the<i> Malta,</i>

12:21.899 --> 12:23.900
a steamboat carrying goods
and valuables

12:23.984 --> 12:27.820
that sank in the Missouri River
in August of 1841.

12:27.905 --> 12:29.238
Let's do it.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.073
NARRATOR:
However, today,

12:31.167 --> 12:33.743
because the course
of the river has shifted

12:33.836 --> 12:35.995
more than 900 feet to the north,

12:36.079 --> 12:39.007
the wreck lies buried
beneath a cornfield.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.417
- Hey, guys.
- How are you?

12:41.510 --> 12:45.180
NARRATOR: Today, Marty has
arranged for local drillers Jared Sisk

12:45.339 --> 12:47.098
and Wade Johnson
to help pinpoint

12:47.183 --> 12:49.184
the<i> Malta's</i> orientation.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.594
You can feel the boat just
rumbling under your feet, right?

12:51.687 --> 12:54.347
Uh, here's the thing.
(laughs)

12:54.440 --> 12:57.609
Here's the thing, Dave.
I can't even see the river.

12:57.768 --> 12:59.268
Yeah, it's hard to imagine
a river--

12:59.353 --> 13:02.188
A riverboat running upriver

13:02.272 --> 13:03.356
- right here.
- Right here.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.200
You know, 'cause now
we're in a cornfield.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.286
- Yeah, crazy.
- I know, that is absolutely amazing.

13:08.445 --> 13:10.455
- That's part of the magic of all this.
- Yes.

13:10.539 --> 13:16.369
Because not far from here,
somewhere, is that boat.

13:16.453 --> 13:19.881
NARRATOR: Built in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1839,

13:19.965 --> 13:22.875
the<i> Malta</i> was a 141-foot-long-

13:22.960 --> 13:25.378
by-22-foot-wide paddle steamer.

13:25.471 --> 13:30.800
In 1841, it left St. Louis
loaded with 115 tons

13:30.884 --> 13:34.813
of supplies that included
rifles, saddles and gold.

13:34.897 --> 13:39.392
But some 200 miles into its
journey, the<i> Malta</i> collided

13:39.485 --> 13:42.228
with a submerged tree limb
that ripped open its hull.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.481
It quickly sank, taking
all of its precious cargo

13:45.566 --> 13:48.484
to the bottom
of the Missouri River.

13:48.569 --> 13:50.486
How did you find this spot

13:50.579 --> 13:51.904
and start to triangulate
this particular...

13:51.997 --> 13:52.989
- Spot?
- Yeah.

13:53.073 --> 13:55.157
This is what they
called Malta Bend.

13:55.242 --> 13:56.417
- This whole thing?
- Yeah.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.003
And what happens is,
when the boats would sink,

13:59.088 --> 14:01.923
the next generation
of mapmakers, as they created

14:02.082 --> 14:03.675
the next map of the river,

14:03.759 --> 14:05.844
they would call "this"

14:05.928 --> 14:07.428
- in the honor of the boat that sank here.
- Makes sense.

14:07.513 --> 14:11.015
So this then became
Malta Bend on the map.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.852
NARRATOR: David is
hopeful that today's search

14:14.011 --> 14:16.104
for the<i> Malta</i> will be a success,

14:16.263 --> 14:19.432
because he's found evidence
of its location once before

14:19.525 --> 14:20.850
and then lost it.

14:20.934 --> 14:24.112
I started the search
for the<i> Malta</i> in 2015

14:24.196 --> 14:26.856
with as much maps
as I had and as much

14:26.940 --> 14:28.616
information from the newspaper
as I could gather,

14:28.775 --> 14:30.026
which really wasn't much.

14:30.110 --> 14:32.954
And at home on my computer,
I would draw a grid,

14:33.038 --> 14:35.456
and I'd import that grid
into my handheld GPS,

14:35.616 --> 14:37.533
and I'd go out and walk the grid

14:37.626 --> 14:39.544
with the metal detector,
the magnetometer.

14:41.121 --> 14:43.631
And there was nothing there
that first day, nor the second,

14:43.716 --> 14:46.459
nor the third or the fourth,
and so on and so forth.

14:46.543 --> 14:50.963
It took two years to find it.
It was remarkable.

14:51.048 --> 14:53.725
NARRATOR: Although David
made great progress marking

14:53.884 --> 14:56.385
the location of the<i> Malta,</i>
unfortunately,

14:56.470 --> 14:59.564
severe storms
caused the Missouri River

14:59.648 --> 15:03.902
to flood the area, and washed
away all of his markers.

15:04.061 --> 15:06.646
Now, before he can begin
excavating the<i> Malta,</i>

15:06.730 --> 15:10.983
David must reestablish
its exact orientation.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.744
The boat sinks in '41.

15:12.903 --> 15:15.905
This is an 1879 map.
Close as I could find.

15:15.989 --> 15:18.082
The tan line was
that old river channel.

15:18.241 --> 15:20.159
And look how
windy and wiggly it is.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.837
-Mm-hmm.
-That's how it was. That's the natural river.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.340
The blue line is more or less
where we're at today.

15:25.499 --> 15:27.425
- So, we're here?
- Mm-hmm.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.928
-We're right... we're right in here.
-Oh, okay, yeah.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.681
So the boat came up and came
along the bottom of this island.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.342
Didn't quite make it,
sank about here.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.437
- Right through there.
- And this is the Malta Bend.

15:39.596 --> 15:42.190
This is the Malta Bend.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.358
This is us right here.
That red dot?

15:43.442 --> 15:45.267
Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

15:45.352 --> 15:48.196
Yeah, we are standing here,
we're probably...

15:48.280 --> 15:50.439
900 feet from the river.

15:50.532 --> 15:53.034
So, before this all flooded out,

15:53.193 --> 15:55.111
you managed to do a little
work here, though, didn't you?

15:55.195 --> 15:57.372
- We did, yeah.
- And that's why you're pretty sure it's here?

15:57.456 --> 16:00.700
- We're absolutely sure it's here.
- How can you say that?

16:00.793 --> 16:02.627
Part of what you do before
you dig a boat, because

16:02.711 --> 16:05.121
it's so very expensive, you've
got to go down into the boat

16:05.205 --> 16:07.131
and bring something
to the surface.

16:07.290 --> 16:08.549
- You got to see something.
- And you have?

16:08.709 --> 16:09.959
We did. Really cool stuff.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.128
- Oh, you have it here?
- We do.

16:12.212 --> 16:14.806
- Ooh!
- Yeah. This is it.

16:15.966 --> 16:17.558
- (jingling)
- I like, I like what it's in.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.551
- (laughs)
- Oh, yeah.

16:18.635 --> 16:20.228
- I like how it sounds.
- Uh-huh.

16:20.387 --> 16:21.637
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

16:21.722 --> 16:23.815
- Sounds good, right?
- Oh, yeah, that's all good.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.943
- Oh, my. - No way.
- Oh, yeah.

16:28.145 --> 16:31.147
- You got that in one single core?
- One time.

16:31.231 --> 16:33.899
- 150 gold buttons.
- A bunch of stuff.

16:33.984 --> 16:37.245
Ceramics, fabric,
chunks of lard, window glass.

16:37.404 --> 16:38.738
-Can I pick one of these up? You okay with it?
-Absolutely.

16:38.822 --> 16:41.416
-Go for it, here.
-MATTY: May I? That's incredible.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.001
MARTY: When he pours
out that bag of gilded buttons,

16:43.085 --> 16:44.326
I was very impressed.

16:44.411 --> 16:47.413
It does show without any
doubt that he has found

16:47.497 --> 16:52.176
a steamboat, and highly
likely to be the<i> Malta.</i>

16:52.261 --> 16:56.597
So these buttons here
on this boat in that sample

16:56.757 --> 16:59.684
were some-- just a tiny little
piece-- of what was going west

16:59.768 --> 17:02.437
to the Native Americans
to be traded for furs.

17:02.596 --> 17:04.022
MATTY:
Unbelievable.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.514
Will you please come
to Oak Island?

17:05.607 --> 17:07.516
'Cause I think you're lucky,
too, okay?

17:07.601 --> 17:09.602
- You're obviously a hard worker, but that's...
- I'm telling you.

17:09.686 --> 17:11.187
- That's good stuff.
- You're either incredibly lucky,

17:11.271 --> 17:13.197
or there's an incredible
amount of stuff down there.

17:13.356 --> 17:14.857
- There is. - Yeah, there is.
- Or maybe both.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.275
- Yeah, maybe both.
- Maybe a little of both.

17:16.359 --> 17:19.028
- I mean, that's what keeps you going.
- Exactly.

17:19.112 --> 17:21.873
Well, let's find more of this.
Let's fire it up!

17:21.957 --> 17:24.450
-All right, that sounds great. Let's go get it.
-All right.

17:24.534 --> 17:27.962
NARRATOR: Before David can move
forward with plans to excavate the<i> Malta</i>

17:28.047 --> 17:31.123
steamboat and recover
its valuable cargo,

17:31.208 --> 17:35.720
the team must reestablish its
exact orientation underground,

17:35.804 --> 17:38.723
starting with what David
hopes is its western edge.

17:38.882 --> 17:41.383
Today, the plan is
to use a rotary drill,

17:41.468 --> 17:43.644
put an exploratory hole
down there,

17:43.729 --> 17:45.471
and see what comes
to the surface.

17:45.555 --> 17:46.981
What David is looking for

17:47.140 --> 17:50.651
is wood from the<i> Malta.</i>

17:50.736 --> 17:52.228
And if that starts coming up,

17:52.321 --> 17:53.395
he knows he's in the right spot,

17:53.480 --> 17:54.864
and then he can
measure it from there.

17:57.901 --> 18:01.746
NARRATOR: Based on David's
magnetometer readings from 2015,

18:01.905 --> 18:04.415
he's located what he
believes to be the<i> Malta's</i>

18:04.500 --> 18:07.001
iron boiler in
the center of the ship.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.662
Using that as
the starting coordinate,

18:09.746 --> 18:12.498
the team's first objective
will be to drill down

18:12.582 --> 18:15.093
in an attempt to find
one side of the wreck.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.847
MARTY: So, right here this
is the magnetometer center?

18:19.932 --> 18:21.173
- Yep.
- Yeah, it should be right there.

18:21.258 --> 18:22.424
Exactly where the engine's at.

18:22.509 --> 18:25.269
We know the magnetics
from the magnetometer.

18:25.354 --> 18:29.190
The engines, the boilers are
just generally in this area.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.192
We had it all marked
out at one point.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.111
The rivers took it away.

18:33.270 --> 18:36.105
I say we kind of come
in this direction.

18:36.189 --> 18:38.616
We might miss, we might hit,

18:38.775 --> 18:41.702
- but that's what we're here to figure out.
- Right.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.197
David has already done 95%
of the work to find the<i> Malta.</i>

18:45.282 --> 18:47.449
He knows where the boiler is.

18:47.534 --> 18:49.293
All we're doing is to help
him with sort of the final

18:49.452 --> 18:51.963
stage of what can
be done on the surface.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.457
So, when you get
at your target depth

18:55.542 --> 18:57.459
or around the target depth,

18:57.544 --> 19:00.138
you use this to
catch what's coming out?

19:00.222 --> 19:02.882
Yeah. I'll visually be
able to see the change.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.884
- Feel it through a little bit.
- Yeah, and feel it.

19:04.968 --> 19:06.719
And then I'll be able
to tell him, hey, we need

19:06.803 --> 19:08.053
to start catching these cuttings

19:08.138 --> 19:10.148
'cause I'm feeling something
out of the ordinary.

19:10.307 --> 19:11.315
Okay.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.650
- All righty, you guys ready?
- Proceed.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.110
Let's see if we can get
some water circulating.

19:21.994 --> 19:26.405
From our notes, we should hit
the deck of the boat at 37 feet.

19:26.498 --> 19:30.251
And as we get closer and closer
to that 37-foot level,

19:30.335 --> 19:32.578
we're going to be
watching for pine.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.173
That'll be the blond wood that
comes out of the hole first.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.592
That's the deck wood.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.427
We're getting into
the money zone!

19:39.511 --> 19:41.003
And that will be
conclusive evidence that

19:41.087 --> 19:43.181
we are in fact right on top
of the boat.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.192
-Uh-oh. He just gave him the cut sign.
-Yeah, I saw it.

19:54.351 --> 19:56.360
MATTY: This is either
good or bad news.

20:04.527 --> 20:06.612
Yeah, I think we're beyond
the boat on this hole.

20:06.696 --> 20:09.281
Okay.

20:09.374 --> 20:13.035
Well, you know, but it's
here, right? It's here.

20:13.119 --> 20:15.120
Well, it was the last
time we were here.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.049
NARRATOR: In the town
of Malta Bend, Missouri,

20:18.208 --> 20:20.968
Marty Lagina and Matty Blake
are helping

20:21.053 --> 20:23.471
treasure hunter
David Hawley and his team

20:23.630 --> 20:27.225
locate the wreck of a historic
riverboat known as the<i> Malta,</i>

20:27.384 --> 20:30.302
which today is buried
some 40 feet beneath

20:30.387 --> 20:33.138
a cornfield
near the Missouri River.

20:33.223 --> 20:35.891
So, Jared, you think we're
past target depth,

20:35.976 --> 20:36.725
and you're getting nothing?

20:36.818 --> 20:37.985
Yeah, we're past target depth,

20:38.070 --> 20:39.987
and we're not getting
anything, so...

20:40.072 --> 20:41.897
It's okay, it's what we do.
We'll move over this way.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.824
Okay. I'll follow your lead.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.660
- Yeah, it's-it's-- yeah.
- Okay. Let's dig another one.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.069
Okay. Sounds good.

20:47.153 --> 20:48.570
MARTY:
If you think about the mission

20:48.655 --> 20:50.331
to delineate the edges of this,

20:50.490 --> 20:53.918
if you never miss, you haven't
accomplished the mission.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.828
If you never miss, you don't
know where the edges are.

20:55.912 --> 20:57.421
So you have to miss.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.832
You have to find it,
and you also have to miss.

20:59.916 --> 21:01.425
And then, in between,
that's where the edge is.

21:01.584 --> 21:03.427
This is basic trial
and error at this point.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.596
We miss here,
we know it's over there,

21:05.755 --> 21:07.265
so we just move
a little bit closer.

21:13.263 --> 21:15.940
We're at about
29 feet right now!

21:16.024 --> 21:18.109
- We're getting close, guys.
- Yep.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.022
MATTY: David knows the boat
is somewhere down there.

21:23.106 --> 21:25.024
"We're gonna hit this." That's
what he keeps telling us.

21:25.108 --> 21:27.368
"We're gonna hit this."
And I believe him.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.779
Dave, you know what's funny
is, like, I'm nervous now.

21:30.864 --> 21:32.623
- I can only imagine how you feel. How do you feel?
- Oh, I do.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.208
I always get nervous.

21:34.367 --> 21:36.460
- Really?
- Yeah, because...

21:36.545 --> 21:38.370
I know we're gonna
touch something

21:38.463 --> 21:42.291
that's almost sacred,
so I don't want to break it.

21:42.375 --> 21:44.885
But number two:
I don't want to miss it.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.304
Right.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.472
MARTY: You can't make an
omelet without cracking eggs.

21:48.631 --> 21:50.308
No, exactly.
You're right, you're right.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.310
You've heard that before,
I'm sure.

21:55.305 --> 21:58.149
Whew!
All right, come on, baby.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.398
- Is that it?
- You're seeing stuff?

22:06.491 --> 22:07.491
Where? Show me.

22:08.902 --> 22:10.402
- Can you grab it?
- Yeah.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.455
- Like this?
- Yeah.

22:18.161 --> 22:19.661
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yep.

22:19.746 --> 22:22.840
Holy moly!
Oh, look at this!

22:22.999 --> 22:24.500
We're getting little
pieces of deck.

22:24.584 --> 22:28.429
- Hey! Yeah!
- What do you say about that?

22:28.513 --> 22:31.757
Wow!
Look at that.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.768
MATTY: When I started to
see that blond wood come out,

22:33.852 --> 22:37.346
I was in shock
at how pristine it was,

22:37.439 --> 22:39.023
how clean it was.
It literally looked like

22:39.182 --> 22:41.266
brand-new boat decking
that just got wet.

22:41.351 --> 22:42.684
Now we know we've got a boat.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.946
DAVID: What you see
there, the blond wood is pine.

22:46.031 --> 22:49.191
But you'll hit the pine first
'cause that's the deck.

22:49.275 --> 22:51.285
And just think, someone's
foot walked right on that

22:51.370 --> 22:53.120
last time it saw air.

22:53.279 --> 22:55.873
-Isn't that crazy? Might have been Mark Twain.
-Yeah.

22:55.957 --> 22:59.701
Man, I got the chills.

22:59.786 --> 23:01.036
Here's another
very interesting piece

23:01.129 --> 23:02.204
we just pulled out of the pile.

23:02.288 --> 23:03.214
Oh, that's a finished edge.

23:03.298 --> 23:05.040
That's a finished edge
right there.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.885
- So, could that be, like, a railing or...
- Yeah.

23:07.969 --> 23:11.555
- Wow.
- That's a really nice piece.

23:11.714 --> 23:13.057
That is the best piece
of wood I've seen.

23:13.216 --> 23:15.050
There's no doubt that
that's a piece of the deck

23:15.135 --> 23:16.802
off of the<i> Malta.</i>

23:16.886 --> 23:18.562
It's just beautiful.

23:18.721 --> 23:20.481
The preservation,
the natural preservation,

23:20.640 --> 23:22.483
it's just breathtaking.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.144
It's just amazing how nature
naturally preserved that.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.988
Being socked into the silt
and the mud and no air.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.658
- That makes all the difference.
- Mm-hmm.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.743
The frustrating thing is,
on Oak Island

23:32.902 --> 23:34.236
we get this all the time,
but we don't know

23:34.320 --> 23:35.404
what the hell we're looking at.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.081
- Here we do. - We do.
- Yeah, here we do.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.332
- Yeah. - Here we do.
- We can visualize.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.160
This is a, this is
an unqualified success.

23:41.244 --> 23:43.162
DAVID: So this is
what we've established.

23:43.246 --> 23:45.247
We know that that's a miss.

23:45.331 --> 23:47.258
- It's a good thing to know that's a miss.
- It is a good thing.

23:47.342 --> 23:49.334
And we know this is a hit.

23:49.419 --> 23:50.586
This gets us close enough

23:50.670 --> 23:53.088
to establish the west side.

23:53.173 --> 23:56.100
What we need to do now is find
the front of the boat.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.935
Then what we're gonna do
is lay it out,

23:58.094 --> 23:59.603
put a chalk on it,
and there's your boat.

23:59.762 --> 24:01.772
So we can actually kind of
see the boat.

24:01.931 --> 24:03.432
Before the sun sets,
we'll see the boat.

24:03.516 --> 24:05.276
JARED:
All right. Let's get after it!

24:05.360 --> 24:07.528
NARRATOR: Now that
the team has located

24:07.612 --> 24:09.697
the western edge of the<i> Malta,</i>

24:09.781 --> 24:12.691
they will move the drill rig
50 feet north,

24:12.784 --> 24:15.277
the known distance between
the boiler and the bow,

24:15.361 --> 24:17.946
or front of the riverboat.

24:18.031 --> 24:19.114
DAVID: That's our
spot, right there, Jared.

24:19.207 --> 24:20.458
- All righty.
- Make a hole.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.877
NARRATOR: If they can
successfully locate the bow,

24:22.961 --> 24:25.787
then Dave Hawley will be
able to determine

24:25.872 --> 24:27.882
the exact orientation
of the<i> Malta.</i>

24:27.966 --> 24:30.426
- JARED: I think we're here.
- Okay.

24:37.642 --> 24:40.144
- That's it.
- Whoo!

24:40.228 --> 24:42.980
- DAVID: That's it.
- MATTY: Let's go!

24:43.064 --> 24:44.398
NARRATOR: Now that they've
determined where the bow,

24:44.483 --> 24:47.735
the western edge and the boiler
of the ship are located,

24:47.894 --> 24:50.070
some 40 feet underground,

24:50.155 --> 24:52.656
the team has
the data points they need

24:52.741 --> 24:54.241
to draw a chalk outline
of the<i> Malta</i>

24:54.326 --> 24:56.902
on the surface of the cornfield.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.246
DAVID: We know
historically the boat's 140 feet,

24:59.331 --> 25:01.165
and we know it's 22 feet wide,

25:01.249 --> 25:04.576
so we're gonna go that way 22,
we're gonna go that way 140.

25:04.661 --> 25:06.086
- MARTY: Draw us a boat.
- There's your boat.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.839
Excellent. Fantastic!

25:13.586 --> 25:15.679
MARTY: Before he
gets to dig that thing out,

25:15.764 --> 25:18.098
a fairly accurate outline of
the boat is absolutely crucial

25:18.183 --> 25:19.925
if you're gonna do this right.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.353
If you're off by a lot,
you're either gonna...

25:22.437 --> 25:25.847
mess it up and have sides
that aren't gonna be safe,

25:25.932 --> 25:28.433
because you had it too far
one way or the other,

25:28.518 --> 25:30.519
or you're gonna move way more
material than you need to.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.112
So you need to be
fairly accurate,

25:32.197 --> 25:33.948
because this is costly
and time-consuming.

25:34.107 --> 25:35.699
And you could mess it up.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.026
MATTY: All right, we're
gonna toast. Ready?

25:38.111 --> 25:39.453
Here we go.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.121
There it is! Lime toast!

25:41.206 --> 25:43.457
- Lime toast!
- Yeah!

25:43.542 --> 25:45.459
- All right, guys, well done, well done.
- That's awesome. Yes.

25:45.618 --> 25:47.127
MARTY:
Got us a boat!

25:47.212 --> 25:50.038
A genuine Missouri steamboat.

25:51.299 --> 25:53.050
MATTY: Talk about bringing
something to life-- on Oak Island,

25:53.134 --> 25:54.459
we always talk about,
imagine if there was a boat,

25:54.544 --> 25:56.712
imagine this, imagine that--
To see it like this...

25:56.796 --> 25:58.046
MARTY:
And it really is under there.

25:58.131 --> 26:00.140
- (exhales)
- DAVID: Yeah.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.301
Yeah, you've held parts of it,
which is a cool thing.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.052
- You've seen it come to earth.
- We know it's there.

26:04.137 --> 26:05.729
- Yeah, you know it's there.
- It's down there, it's down there.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.481
Ah, it looks beautiful.
It looks really cool.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.817
Well, this is the first step.
This is where you start.

26:09.976 --> 26:11.402
- MARTY: Yeah.
- Okay?

26:11.561 --> 26:14.071
NARRATOR:
Similar to how Dave unearthed

26:14.155 --> 26:17.241
the<i> Arabia</i> in 1988,

26:17.400 --> 26:19.401
in order to dry the earth
around the<i> Malta</i>

26:19.494 --> 26:21.662
so that it
can be retrieved intact,

26:21.746 --> 26:23.914
nearly 20,000 gallons of water

26:23.999 --> 26:25.991
will need to be pumped
every minute

26:26.075 --> 26:28.502
some 900 feet north
to the Missouri River

26:28.587 --> 26:31.830
over a period of four months.

26:31.914 --> 26:33.665
How confident are you, Dave,

26:33.750 --> 26:36.176
that you will be able
to pull it out intact?

26:36.261 --> 26:38.086
No one's done that, you know?

26:38.171 --> 26:39.755
But then again, no one's dug

26:39.848 --> 26:41.089
a steamboat
quite like that, either.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.174
Well, I don't know anyone else

26:42.258 --> 26:44.768
that has
a steamboat museum either,

26:44.853 --> 26:46.511
- so my money's on you.
- MARTY: That's true. - DAVID: It's a short list.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.272
- If there's a will there's a way.
- MARTY: So I say

26:48.431 --> 26:49.848
we call it a day, gentlemen,
and tomorrow

26:49.941 --> 26:51.600
- we go after another one, right?
- It's a new adventure.

26:51.684 --> 26:53.027
We find the<i> Radnor</i> tomorrow.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.112
All right, let's go have that...
let's go have that drink.

26:55.196 --> 26:56.605
(laughter)

26:56.698 --> 26:57.865
I'll even buy. What the hell.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.107
MATTY:
Congratulations.

26:59.192 --> 27:01.360
You promised a boat,
you delivered a boat.

27:01.444 --> 27:03.037
DAVID: Well, there you
go. It'd have been bad

27:03.121 --> 27:04.622
not to have done that.

27:11.788 --> 27:14.206
NARRATOR: One day after helping
to locate a riverboat known as the<i> Malta</i>

27:14.299 --> 27:15.549
beneath a cornfield...

27:15.708 --> 27:18.627
- There they are.
- Marty Lagina

27:18.711 --> 27:21.889
and Matty Blake travel 45 miles
to Boonville, Missouri,

27:22.048 --> 27:24.308
to assist David and Matt Hawley

27:24.392 --> 27:28.053
in their quest to find
another lost 19th century ship--

27:28.146 --> 27:30.138
A ship known as the<i> Radnor--</i>

27:30.223 --> 27:34.401
Which sank in the Missouri River
in 1846.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.487
All we got to do
is get you guys loaded up,

27:36.571 --> 27:38.656
and we'll go ahead and get
this thing dropped in the water.

27:38.815 --> 27:41.325
- So it's easy as that.
- Okay. If it's that easy, let's go.

27:41.484 --> 27:43.485
- Just like that.
- (chuckles): Just like that.

27:43.578 --> 27:46.413
- David's a remarkable guy.
- MATTY: Away we go.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.324
MARTY: He wants to find the<i>
Radnor</i> as well to advance his goal.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.585
Very admirable.
So we're gonna go look for it.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.829
This one, he thinks,
is sunk in the river.

27:53.913 --> 27:55.839
And by the way, the reason
he thinks that is because,

27:55.998 --> 27:57.749
God bless him, he's
already worked the shoreline

27:57.842 --> 27:59.167
and he didn't find it.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.585
That's why he thinks
it's in the river.

28:00.670 --> 28:03.839
So he's already narrowed
the search.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.350
DAVID:
What we know about the<i> Radnor,</i>

28:06.434 --> 28:09.103
built in 1843,

28:09.187 --> 28:10.604
sank in 1846.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.013
Three years old.

28:12.098 --> 28:15.434
But it was on its way
to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.361
Really the first military post
west of the Mississippi.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.521
Sure.

28:19.605 --> 28:21.857
NARRATOR: The steamboat<i>
Radnor</i> was transporting

28:21.950 --> 28:24.526
60 tons of supplies
for the U.S. Army

28:24.619 --> 28:29.790
280 miles from St. Louis
to Leavenworth, Kansas.

28:29.874 --> 28:32.209
Although the exact records
have been lost,

28:32.368 --> 28:35.787
the<i> Radnor's</i> cargo is believed
to have included guns,

28:35.880 --> 28:38.132
provisions, military uniforms,

28:38.291 --> 28:41.710
cannons, ammunition
and gold coins--

28:41.803 --> 28:44.972
Meant to pay the wages
of soldiers.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.474
DAVID: You know, when these boats
were coming up and down the river,

28:47.559 --> 28:49.643
three-quarters
of all of these hundreds

28:49.728 --> 28:52.813
and hundreds of boats sank
because of these trees.

28:52.972 --> 28:55.724
MATTY:
Have you targeted an area

28:55.808 --> 28:58.393
that you want to hit in terms
of what we're gonna do today?

28:58.478 --> 28:59.820
Well, generally, but...

28:59.979 --> 29:00.904
You want to look at these maps?

29:01.063 --> 29:02.564
Let's take a look at that
really quick.

29:02.657 --> 29:06.067
Okay, these are
our historic maps.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.152
We're gonna come up,
we're gonna turn.

29:07.245 --> 29:10.831
Now, the tan line is
the old channel.

29:10.990 --> 29:12.750
We're gonna just walk
along the bank

29:12.834 --> 29:15.911
- and work our way out.
- Right.

29:15.995 --> 29:18.088
DAVID: We'll go up,
we're gonna come back.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.166
But what we're gonna work
with the captain to do is,

29:21.259 --> 29:23.585
instead of turning the boat
all the way around each time,

29:23.669 --> 29:26.338
we're gonna let the river
push us backwards.

29:26.431 --> 29:29.424
The current of the river
is always fighting you,

29:29.509 --> 29:31.351
pushing you backwards,
pushing you sideways.

29:31.511 --> 29:32.603
You're watching

29:32.687 --> 29:35.597
for trees and debris
washing into the boat

29:35.681 --> 29:37.432
and into the propellers
of the boat.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.601
So it's...
it's a far more dangerous search

29:39.694 --> 29:42.854
and a far more challenging
search.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.448
But it's there.

29:44.532 --> 29:47.117
The next thing we got to do is
get this metal detector out--

29:47.276 --> 29:49.036
The magnetometer--
And we're gonna start scanning

29:49.195 --> 29:52.697
this water slowly as we go.

29:52.782 --> 29:54.625
- Okay?
- Sounds good.

29:54.709 --> 29:57.369
-All right? Here we go. This is it.
-Let's do it.

29:57.453 --> 29:59.630
NARRATOR:
In order to find the<i> Radnor,</i>

29:59.714 --> 30:03.300
Marty has arranged for the team
to use a magnetometer:

30:03.459 --> 30:06.628
a device typically used
by wreck salvagers

30:06.721 --> 30:08.806
to identify
underwater metal objects.

30:08.965 --> 30:12.801
Although the<i> Radnor</i>
was mostly constructed of wood,

30:12.885 --> 30:14.561
David is hopeful
that its massive boiler

30:14.720 --> 30:17.639
will prove to be
the perfect target.

30:17.732 --> 30:19.900
The magnetic signal
from a steamboat--

30:20.059 --> 30:21.560
Because of the size
of the boilers--

30:21.644 --> 30:24.145
Extends out
for quite some distance.

30:24.230 --> 30:26.731
And if it gradually grows

30:26.825 --> 30:29.734
from 125 gammas to 150 gammas

30:29.828 --> 30:32.404
to 200 gammas or beyond,

30:32.497 --> 30:36.825
then that's an indication that
there's something very large

30:36.918 --> 30:39.503
and something significant
underneath you.

30:39.587 --> 30:41.088
Bring it down.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.414
Perfect.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.175
Matt, we're gonna keep
that cable above the door.

30:45.334 --> 30:47.678
Okay.

30:47.762 --> 30:50.255
- So it's ready to measure.
- It's ready to go. - Let's start looking.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.432
DAVID: Okay, Captain,
let's bring us into the bank,

30:52.517 --> 30:54.434
- 50 feet off...
- KC: Sounds good.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.353
and we'll start our search.

30:56.437 --> 30:59.180
Our GPS is keeping track
of where we're at.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.765
We're gonna take
our first reading.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.109
- Good.
- All right.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.518
We're gonna establish
a baseline.

31:03.603 --> 31:05.937
What is that sh...
where no metal is?

31:06.022 --> 31:08.440
52-1-1-7.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.442
Okay, 52-1-1-7 gammas.

31:10.526 --> 31:11.785
MATTY:
That's your base?

31:11.944 --> 31:13.778
- DAVID: That's baseline.
- Got it.

31:13.863 --> 31:15.864
MARTY: What's gonna
get your juices going?

31:15.948 --> 31:16.707
Give me a number.

31:16.866 --> 31:17.949
- Give me a 200 number.
- Okay.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.367
- I'm happy.
- MATTY: Ooh, all right. Okay.

31:19.452 --> 31:22.045
Give me above...
north of 200, I'm even happier.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.130
- Okay.
- What's your...

31:23.289 --> 31:25.206
KC, what's your speed
going forward?

31:25.291 --> 31:26.875
We are going...

31:26.959 --> 31:28.719
we're going .9 right now.

31:28.878 --> 31:31.471
- So go a little faster?
- Nope, you're good.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.131
We're at 155.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.392
- 155? That's a big move.
- 155. It's a big move.

31:35.476 --> 31:37.811
- Hey! All right!
- We have not been this high before.

31:37.970 --> 31:40.722
Let's take another. Go slow, KC.
Let's bring it down to a creep.

31:40.815 --> 31:43.150
All right. I can pin here,
too, if you want to.

31:43.234 --> 31:44.893
Yeah, pin it there,
pin it there.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.820
We're above something
that has made that jump

31:46.979 --> 31:49.147
- from 113 to...
- Yeah. Yeah.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.817
These magnetic signals,
they go out a long ways.

31:52.902 --> 31:55.236
And so you'll see it coming,
just like you're seeing it.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.915
It'll get bigger
and it'll get bigger.

31:58.074 --> 32:00.334
MATTY: You were not lying
about this current, guys,

32:00.493 --> 32:01.993
'cause when you have
the perspective

32:02.086 --> 32:03.921
of something still on the boat,
it is flying.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.331
- It's flying by you. Yeah. Yeah.
- Wow.

32:06.415 --> 32:08.667
Oh, there's a big old log
under us.

32:08.751 --> 32:11.169
DAVID:
157. We're still going up.

32:11.253 --> 32:12.587
And we're still traveling, okay?

32:12.672 --> 32:15.265
Now, if these signals come up
and they disappear...

32:15.350 --> 32:17.267
you forget them.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.853
But if they continue up
and step up, step up, step up,

32:20.012 --> 32:22.430
you got to take record of that.

32:22.515 --> 32:24.524
MARTY: We're going
backwards now, though.

32:24.684 --> 32:28.269
KC: We probably just floated
back about 20 feet, being in neutral,

32:28.354 --> 32:31.114
trying to dodge some
of these logs over here.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.525
We had a log come right up

32:33.618 --> 32:36.528
and touch our front toon,
so we went neutral to make sure

32:36.612 --> 32:38.956
we didn't do any damage
to the engine and prop.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.291
- DAVID: It's all right.
- MATTY: You got one port here.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.794
KC: Oh, yeah, we got a nice one
floating downstream over there.

32:43.953 --> 32:47.288
DAVID: Yeah, KC, you are right,
we are drifting back south.

32:47.373 --> 32:49.958
So we're gonna bump up
forward speed.

32:50.042 --> 32:51.385
- All right.
- We've got to make up some distance.

32:51.469 --> 32:54.129
We're back. I bet you--
In fact, if I took a reading,

32:54.213 --> 32:56.798
we're gonna be back
in the 115s-ish.

32:56.882 --> 32:58.558
KC: I can bring us directly
back to our waypoint.

32:58.718 --> 33:01.803
- I did ping it.
- MARTY: Yeah, do that and then creep forward, right?

33:01.896 --> 33:04.231
I can go right back
to where we were.

33:04.390 --> 33:05.724
Yeah, so if he goes
to his waypoint

33:05.808 --> 33:06.725
and then creeps forward,
that's what you want, yeah.

33:06.809 --> 33:08.151
Then we'll be back
where we were.

33:08.310 --> 33:10.812
- And if you see, like, a really good reading...
- DAVID: 175.

33:10.896 --> 33:12.739
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Okay, here we go.

33:12.898 --> 33:14.149
Pin it, pin it
right there. 175.

33:14.242 --> 33:16.067
That's the highest
we've been today.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.578
- Yes, you said 200 gets your juices.
- 200, then we're...

33:18.663 --> 33:21.489
we are within seeing distance.

33:21.574 --> 33:23.074
So you think
you're finding it right now?

33:23.167 --> 33:24.918
Oh, I think we're finding it.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.503
MATTY:
Wow.

33:30.758 --> 33:32.592
NARRATOR: While searching
for a sunken steamboat in the Mis

33:32.677 --> 33:34.753
Matty Blake and Marty Lagina,

33:34.846 --> 33:38.098
along with treasure hunters
Matt and David Hawley,

33:38.182 --> 33:41.509
have just made what could be
an important discovery.

33:41.594 --> 33:43.353
Just so I'm clear,
we are above something

33:43.438 --> 33:45.263
that is making that rise
dramatically.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.524
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

33:52.021 --> 33:54.448
253.

33:54.532 --> 33:57.617
- You got it, baby.
- 253. Okay, can you mark this spot?

33:57.702 --> 33:59.277
Can we hold it at this location?

33:59.370 --> 34:01.029
All right.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.865
- Ooh, baby.
- Oh, baby. You're right.

34:03.949 --> 34:05.950
255.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.211
- Let's mark this place right here.
- All right.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.716
MARTY: Okay, guys, let's have
a little powwow here.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.710
What I'm thinking, guys, if we
all agree here, you probably...

34:15.795 --> 34:17.212
What do you figure
your GPS accuracy is,

34:17.296 --> 34:19.130
or your waypoint, actually?

34:19.215 --> 34:20.298
- It's pretty... very, uh...
- Within a few feet.

34:20.382 --> 34:22.392
It's pretty dang close.

34:22.477 --> 34:24.978
There is an anomaly out here,
a powerful anomaly.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.230
An iron anomaly
similar to what you found,

34:27.389 --> 34:29.808
based on the relative sizes
of these...

34:29.892 --> 34:31.151
- Totally accurate.
- Yeah.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.819
I think,
from everything I've seen,

34:32.978 --> 34:34.488
from all I can determine,

34:34.572 --> 34:36.147
from the metal readings
we've seen,

34:36.232 --> 34:37.824
we are on top of the<i> Radnor.</i>

34:37.983 --> 34:39.993
MATTY:
This might be

34:40.078 --> 34:42.913
the first time
it's been brought back to life.

34:43.072 --> 34:45.406
Absolutely. First time
anybody's discovered it.

34:45.491 --> 34:46.825
MARTY:
What happens next?

34:46.909 --> 34:48.827
What the hell are you gonna do
with a boat

34:48.920 --> 34:50.328
out here in the middle
of this powerful current?

34:50.421 --> 34:53.340
These things are stairsteps.
They're baby steps forward.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.750
You don't say, this is it,
you know, let's celebrate.

34:55.835 --> 34:57.669
You celebrate the next step.

34:57.753 --> 35:01.932
And the next step is
to define what this is.

35:02.016 --> 35:05.677
If it's a boat, you drill it,
you mark it, you measure it,

35:05.770 --> 35:08.429
and you say, "Based on
historical records, this is it."

35:08.523 --> 35:10.515
What we did today,
in determining

35:10.608 --> 35:13.685
exactly the location
of the<i> Radnor,</i> was historic.

35:13.769 --> 35:15.362
It's the first step.
It's what you've got to do.

35:15.446 --> 35:18.606
But it takes this giant river,

35:18.691 --> 35:21.118
and it says:
this is the spot to find it.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.620
This is the location
of where she lays.

35:23.704 --> 35:25.697
Is there more work to do?
Sure, there is.

35:25.781 --> 35:27.541
There's next steps to take.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.118
But we've taken a big one today.

35:30.202 --> 35:31.452
But this is the first step.

35:31.537 --> 35:33.371
Finding the metal is
the first step.

35:33.464 --> 35:35.039
MARTY:
As I look up

35:35.124 --> 35:36.457
and I look at how far out
on the river we are,

35:36.551 --> 35:38.042
and I look
at that swirling current,

35:38.127 --> 35:40.637
and I look at the trees coming
down the river, and I think,

35:40.721 --> 35:42.472
"David, this one
is not gonna be easy."

35:42.557 --> 35:44.299
I mean, not that the others
were easy,

35:44.383 --> 35:46.718
but this one's gonna be
exceptionally difficult.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.895
Well, I think we've done
what we came to do today, guys,

35:48.980 --> 35:51.139
-I really do.
-DAVID: This was successful. This was a good day.

35:51.223 --> 35:53.141
- MATTY: Great day.
- You got any wine on board?

35:53.225 --> 35:54.317
(laughing)

35:54.402 --> 35:56.987
- MATTY: Good job, partner.
- Good job, Matt.

36:02.577 --> 36:05.153
MARTY: I can't help it,
I have treasure envy.

36:05.246 --> 36:07.831
You look at what
Dave Hawley has done,

36:07.915 --> 36:09.991
and, I mean,
here's a classic example

36:10.075 --> 36:12.160
of a treasure hunter
doing it right.

36:12.244 --> 36:15.005
- I mean, look at the museum he created.
- And what a great trip.

36:15.089 --> 36:16.748
- That was...
- MARTY: That was one of the coolest things

36:16.841 --> 36:19.334
I've ever experienced.
I mean, um, you know,

36:19.418 --> 36:21.011
I don't know where to start.

36:21.095 --> 36:22.670
I'll start with this.

36:22.755 --> 36:23.930
(chuckles softly)

36:24.015 --> 36:26.424
- This is the<i> Arabia.</i>
- RICK: Look at this.

36:26.508 --> 36:29.269
It's like an open-pit mine.

36:29.353 --> 36:30.937
It is. I mean,
the scale of the work.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.439
The engineering involved

36:32.523 --> 36:35.016
to figure out
how to accomplish it.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.935
But after you get over
the sort of shock

36:37.019 --> 36:40.271
that this riverboat can be
under a cornfield,

36:40.364 --> 36:42.941
and then you look
at what Dave Hawley has found...

36:43.034 --> 36:46.611
- I'm jealous.
- Yeah. I imagine you would be.

36:46.695 --> 36:48.455
Because this is what we envision
here on Oak Island.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.031
I'm just jealous
of what you experienced.

36:50.115 --> 36:53.126
- MARTY: Oh, yeah.
- On two levels I'm jealous, I guess.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.878
But in a good way.

36:55.037 --> 36:56.788
Well, Rick,
you might as well meet the guy.

36:56.872 --> 36:58.215
Dave Hawley is standing by,

36:58.374 --> 36:59.874
and I-I'm curious
to talk with him, too,

36:59.959 --> 37:01.134
because I'd like an update.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.136
I mean, I'd like to know
if he's made any progress

37:03.221 --> 37:05.555
in getting
those next two riverboats, so...

37:05.640 --> 37:07.891
- Put him on the screen, Matty Blake.
- All right, stand by.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.221
- MARTY: Hey, Dave!
<i>- Good morning. How are y'all?</i>

37:13.305 --> 37:15.315
Real fine, sir.
You got Marty and Matty

37:15.474 --> 37:17.725
and my brother Rick here.

37:17.810 --> 37:19.236
Good morning, sir. How are you?

37:19.320 --> 37:20.478
<i>Got the whole gang.</i>

37:20.562 --> 37:22.647
<i>Well, it's nice
to see you all again.</i>

37:22.740 --> 37:24.824
<i>And, Rick, it's nice
to make your acquaintance.</i>

37:24.909 --> 37:26.243
Nice to make yours, sir,
I have...

37:26.327 --> 37:27.410
Just from the photographs,

37:27.569 --> 37:30.321
and from what Matty
and my brother have said,

37:30.414 --> 37:33.667
I have immense respect
for what you've accomplished.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.994
- Thank you. That's very kind.
- Yeah.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.338
You know what it's like
to dig in the mud, so...

37:38.422 --> 37:40.757
- (chuckles) We do.
<i>- From one mud digger to the next,</i>

37:40.841 --> 37:43.009
- thank you.
- I-I appreciate that.

37:43.168 --> 37:44.919
It's a sign of respect.

37:45.004 --> 37:46.429
MARTY:
Hey, Dave, all three of us now

37:46.514 --> 37:48.848
are keenly following
what you're doing.

37:48.933 --> 37:52.010
Tell us,
any developments on the<i> Radnor?</i>

37:52.094 --> 37:54.521
<i>Yes, sir,
there are major developments.</i>

37:54.680 --> 37:56.356
<i>It's going to be tricky,</i>

37:56.440 --> 37:57.440
and it'll be a little dangerous.

37:58.859 --> 37:59.943
Eh, maybe a lot dangerous.

38:06.525 --> 38:09.110
All right, then, tell us about
the<i> Radnor.</i> What's going on?

38:09.194 --> 38:10.778
<i>The</i> Radnor's<i> gonna be</i>

38:10.863 --> 38:12.363
<i>an awesome,
awesome boat to recover.</i>

38:12.448 --> 38:15.283
As you know,
having been out there...

38:15.376 --> 38:16.534
- Yes.
<i>- On that very fast water,</i>

38:16.618 --> 38:18.369
<i>it's going to be tricky.</i>

38:18.454 --> 38:21.539
My thought would be
to bring two barges with cranes

38:21.623 --> 38:25.093
on the barge, left and right...

38:26.304 --> 38:30.214
dredge off the mud
to get down to the boat.

38:30.308 --> 38:34.802
Then you strap underneath it
with wide, heavy straps,

38:34.887 --> 38:38.481
and the cranes lift,
they'll lift it out of the mud.

38:38.566 --> 38:42.319
Bring in the third barge,
push it underneath the<i> Radnor,</i>

38:42.403 --> 38:44.479
then refill with air.

38:44.563 --> 38:46.731
And between the two barges,
left and right,

38:46.815 --> 38:49.743
that are lifting and the one
underneath that's pushing it up,

38:49.827 --> 38:52.820
I think the three will do it.

38:52.905 --> 38:54.831
That's gonna be a tough one.

38:55.916 --> 38:57.658
Difficult, absolutely.

38:57.743 --> 38:59.586
MARTY:
That is gonna let you

38:59.670 --> 39:00.837
scratch your head a little bit

39:00.996 --> 39:02.589
- when you go after that<i> Radnor.</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

39:02.673 --> 39:04.415
MARTY:
We gained a hell of a respect

39:04.508 --> 39:07.761
for the Missouri River,
having been out there, you know.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.596
<i>The Missouri River always wins.</i>

39:09.680 --> 39:12.015
- MARTY: Yep.
- RICK: Sounds like you picked

39:12.099 --> 39:13.925
- a difficult one with the<i> Radnor.</i>
- Yes.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.685
All right, then,

39:15.844 --> 39:18.596
tell us,
any developments on the<i> Malta?</i>

39:18.680 --> 39:20.431
The<i> Malta</i> will be
the next boat to dig.

39:20.524 --> 39:24.769
<i>That's the goal right now
is a dig perhaps next year.</i>

39:24.862 --> 39:26.446
Now, we won't know for sure
until we get down there,

39:26.530 --> 39:30.608
<i>but if the</i> Malta<i> is intact,</i>
<i>as it feels like it might be,</i>

39:30.701 --> 39:34.695
<i>we would like to bring in
a team of craftsmen</i>

39:34.789 --> 39:37.457
and take that boat apart,
number it,

39:37.541 --> 39:40.451
and then rebuild it
inside of a building.

39:40.536 --> 39:43.380
<i>So you'll have
the actual whole structure</i>

39:43.464 --> 39:46.124
of an 1840s steamboat
on display.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.050
That's amazing.

39:47.134 --> 39:49.377
<i>You start doing that, you become</i>

39:49.461 --> 39:52.964
<i>a world-class exhibit
right away quick.</i>

39:53.048 --> 39:55.308
You're going to need
a bigger museum, buddy.

39:55.467 --> 39:58.812
<i>Well, I know, that's kind of
what we're working on now, too.</i>

39:58.896 --> 40:00.304
But I still have to say, sir,

40:00.389 --> 40:02.816
I would have sold
some of it, okay?

40:02.900 --> 40:05.985
- I would have. I mean...
<i>- Well, I don't know.</i>

40:06.070 --> 40:08.146
- I'm not faulting you.
<i>- No, I don't think you would.</i>

40:08.230 --> 40:11.074
<i>All of these pieces are kind of
like pieces to a jigsaw puzzle,</i>

40:11.233 --> 40:13.910
<i>and if you lose
one or two of them,</i>

40:14.069 --> 40:16.571
<i>the puzzle's not
the same anymore.</i>

40:16.655 --> 40:20.083
- Are you sure you're not our third brother?
- They're kindred spirits.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.168
<i>You know,</i>
<i>the</i> Arabia's<i> one collection,</i>

40:22.253 --> 40:25.171
the<i> Malta</i> will be
another collection.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.090
<i>I mean, the things that</i>
<i>will come off of that</i> Malta

40:27.174 --> 40:29.167
<i>will be...
they'll be jaw-dropping.</i>

40:29.260 --> 40:31.177
<i>They'll be things that
no one's ever seen before.</i>

40:31.262 --> 40:32.512
I think that's right.

40:32.671 --> 40:35.506
Well, I think everything
you've accomplished so far

40:35.599 --> 40:37.600
has been jaw-dropping,
and I know I can speak for Marty

40:37.759 --> 40:39.427
when I say--
Because we discussed it--

40:39.511 --> 40:41.521
Uh, this was mind-blowing.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.857
And, if you don't mind,
anything you need from them,

40:43.941 --> 40:46.350
I can make sure you get,
and we want to stay in touch

40:46.444 --> 40:49.195
with you as you do that
year plan to make that dig.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.189
<i>Oh, absolutely.</i>

40:51.282 --> 40:53.024
MARTY: All right, Dave,
well, thank you very much.

40:53.108 --> 40:54.451
Pleasure, as always.

40:54.535 --> 40:57.195
- Thank you.
- If we can help you in any way, let us know.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.197
-Oh, we'll stay in touch. I promise.
-All right, sir.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.865
-Bye, Dave. Thank you. Appreciate it.
-Bye, Dave, thank you.

41:00.949 --> 41:02.625
- Thanks, Dave.
- Nice to meet you.

41:02.784 --> 41:05.628
- Great guy. Very impressive.
- RICK: Yep.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.288
I mean, it's amazing
to see people

41:07.372 --> 41:09.549
so dedicated, so passionate.

41:09.633 --> 41:12.543
Yeah, he's great. You know,
he's found these things in...

41:12.636 --> 41:15.472
in cornfields, in what used
to be part of the river.

41:15.631 --> 41:19.133
I just wonder if he
can find them in swamps.

41:19.226 --> 41:21.969
- Wouldn't that be handy?
- (laughter)

41:22.054 --> 41:24.397
Yeah, I'd like
to bring him on board.

41:24.482 --> 41:27.233
- He's clearly got the right touch, doesn't he?
- Yeah, he does.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.060
All right, well,
stay tuned, right?

41:29.144 --> 41:30.811
- Absolutely.
- In the meantime,

41:30.905 --> 41:32.822
we still do have a swamp
out there

41:32.981 --> 41:35.241
that has at least parts
of a ship in it.

41:35.400 --> 41:37.568
- So let's get back after it, shall we?
- All right, fellas.

41:37.653 --> 41:38.578
Let's go.
