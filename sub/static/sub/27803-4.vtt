[Ryn] Previously on Siren.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.661
You know some nut actually
tried to convince me

00:07.670 --> 00:09.820
that Bristol Cove mermaids
were real the other day?

00:09.830 --> 00:13.709
Now I got
a contact in my phone
for "Crazy Calvin."

00:13.710 --> 00:16.031
[Helen] They can't last
much longer here.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.280
They need to go back tonight.

00:17.290 --> 00:19.076
I got some ideas.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.207
-[Maddie laughs]
-[Ben] All right.

00:21.210 --> 00:24.327
What if the way
I feel about you

00:24.330 --> 00:25.877
has nothing to do
with the song?

00:25.880 --> 00:27.279
We've never met,

00:27.290 --> 00:29.531
but I think you've
been looking for me.

00:29.540 --> 00:30.916
Keep off of me!

00:32.080 --> 00:33.490
-[grunts]
-[Helen] Dale!

00:33.500 --> 00:35.491

He's gonna be a problem.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.036
[panﬁng]

00:37.040 --> 00:38.325
You weak.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.115
[grunting]

00:46.500 --> 00:47.819
[Ryn] She will die.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.035
Ryn!

No!

03:12.670 --> 03:14.490
Yes.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.535
I go.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.702
I sleep. But I see.

03:21.710 --> 03:24.372
You had a dream.

03:24.380 --> 03:25.608
Dream?

03:25.620 --> 03:27.531
That doesn't happen
in the water?

03:29.290 --> 03:31.372
Humans dream all the time.

03:31.380 --> 03:32.449
Why?

03:32.460 --> 03:33.870
A lot of times

03:33.880 --> 03:35.609
it's how our minds
deal with anxieties.

03:35.620 --> 03:37.326
Um, things we want
or desire.

03:37.330 --> 03:40.288
Things that scare us
or we don't understand.

03:40.290 --> 03:42.030
Oh, hey, Maddie.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.667
-Hi, Burt.
-All right.

03:43.670 --> 03:45.035
Uh, the usual, please.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.780
All right then.
Hey, friend.

03:48.330 --> 03:50.707
Ben is in my dream.

03:50.710 --> 03:52.325
I am scared of him?

03:52.330 --> 03:55.322
I don't think you're
scared of him like he's bad.

03:55.330 --> 03:58.458
You might just be scared
of your feelings for him.

03:59.460 --> 04:01.166
[cell phone ringing]

04:03.830 --> 04:05.411
We were just talking
about you.

04:06.750 --> 04:07.910
[Ben]
You guys almost done?

04:07.920 --> 04:09.410
Yeah. Why?
Everything okay there?

04:09.420 --> 04:11.456
Not exactly.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.325
Okay. Thanks.

04:13.330 --> 04:14.410
We're on our way.

04:22.790 --> 04:25.452

it's a problem!

04:25.460 --> 04:26.996
Ah!

04:27.000 --> 04:29.070
[both grunting]

04:30.380 --> 04:31.529
-Stop!
-What the--

04:34.210 --> 04:35.495
-[Ryn hisses]
-I tried that.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.036
Food.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.248
See, one on one,
they're manageable.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.377
All together,
it's a free-for-all.

04:42.380 --> 04:45.577
In water,
they hunt, fight, rest--

04:45.580 --> 04:46.990
always something to do.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.490
Well, if they
keep it up in here,

04:48.500 --> 04:49.569
someone's gonna find them.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.571
-[hiss]
-[hiss]

04:51.580 --> 04:53.207
No more.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.373
Always we are family,
but not together.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.449
You want to split them up?

04:59.790 --> 05:02.418
-[hissing]
-We must.

05:02.420 --> 05:05.742
-[rock music playing]
-I'll take it.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.820
[Ryn] We make
new home for them.

05:09.460 --> 05:10.666
They stay with humans.

05:10.670 --> 05:12.991
It's fish in a sandwich.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.321
[Ryn] Ones we trust.

05:15.330 --> 05:16.615
Stay.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.668
[Ryn] Males
will guard the tank.

05:18.670 --> 05:20.615
Ben,
don't get me wrong.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.417
I am grateful
for the business
and all, but, uh,

05:22.420 --> 05:24.456
I'm getting the feeling
that some of these people

05:24.460 --> 05:26.166
aren't underage
exchange students.

05:26.170 --> 05:27.159
Uh...

05:27.170 --> 05:28.410
[Ryn] We will teach.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.411
Yeah, they're Ryn's
extended family.

05:32.750 --> 05:33.785
[sighs] Okay, Fishers.

05:33.790 --> 05:35.417
Who's up first?

05:35.420 --> 05:36.819
[Ryn]
They will learn.

05:36.830 --> 05:38.821
I want you to look
right into the camera.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.161
Three, two, one.

05:40.170 --> 05:41.285
[hisses]

05:41.290 --> 05:42.871
Okay, uh...

05:42.880 --> 05:44.575
Yeah,
we'll do that again.

05:44.580 --> 05:47.572
Yeah, one more.
Try to relax your face.

05:47.580 --> 05:48.410
Three, two, one.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.246
Camden.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.377
[Ryn]
They do what humans do.

05:54.380 --> 05:56.951
When they need
to go to water,

05:56.960 --> 05:58.245
they use tank.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.615
Just one of you.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.417
Uh, yeah.
I guess, yeah,

06:01.420 --> 06:02.569
if you could sit down.

06:02.580 --> 06:04.411
-One, two, three.

06:10.540 --> 06:12.496
Just look right
at the camera, please.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.910
Right at the camera.

-You look gorgeous, darling.
-[click]

06:15.710 --> 06:16.870

big guy, you're--
-[startled grunt]

06:20.960 --> 06:22.325
You're up.

06:22.330 --> 06:24.070
[Ryn]
And be just like humans.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.617
[Jerry]
One, two, three.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.872
Sorry, I was running
a little low on inspiration

06:28.880 --> 06:30.666
towards the end there,
but, uh...

06:30.670 --> 06:33.457
I do like a good pair
of Levi's, Levi.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.496
Le-vi.

-Speak.
-Ben.

06:50.170 --> 06:51.910
Wants to go with Ben.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.740
No.

06:53.750 --> 06:56.617
Ryn, he killed Sean.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.531
They tell him
to do this.

06:58.540 --> 07:00.496
To fight.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.661
[Ben] That doesn't
change what happened.

07:02.670 --> 07:03.785
What's Xander gonna think,

07:03.790 --> 07:05.701
me watching him?

07:05.710 --> 07:06.916
He doesn't
have to know.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.535
I can't keep it
from him forever.

07:08.540 --> 07:10.201
Not forever,
just for now.

07:10.210 --> 07:12.371
It's best for everyone.

07:15.710 --> 07:16.699
All right.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.570
Wanna put that up there?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.570
All right, good.

07:44.620 --> 07:47.168
Hey, uh, no.

07:47.170 --> 07:48.159
That way.

07:48.170 --> 07:49.205
Yeah.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.115
Ben.

07:57.750 --> 08:01.242
Um, if he wants to learn
how to be a man, he...

08:02.580 --> 08:03.615
couldn't have picked
a better one.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.071
Thanks, Mads.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.570
[laughs]

08:08.580 --> 08:10.241
Call if you need anything.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.496
Sorry. Old habit.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.660
No. No, no, no.

08:16.670 --> 08:17.739
It's a good one.

08:21.460 --> 08:24.167
-Whoa!
-Sorry. Old habit.

08:25.880 --> 08:26.949
Wrong?

08:26.960 --> 08:28.496
No. No, no, no, no.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.819
It's not-- [ahem]
It's not wrong.

08:29.830 --> 08:31.661
It's, uh...

08:31.670 --> 08:32.659
complicated.

08:32.670 --> 08:35.958
You don't kiss a person

08:35.960 --> 08:38.952
unless they
want to be kissed.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.872
That's kind of the rule.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.495
Rule.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.489
Yeah.

08:45.500 --> 08:49.163
Lots of rules about kissing.

08:49.170 --> 08:51.411
[engine starts]

08:51.420 --> 08:53.456
I know it hasn't
been easy for you

08:53.460 --> 08:54.666
with me being here,
but I don't--

08:54.670 --> 08:56.240
This isn't about you, Mom.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.377
I've been thinking
about moving for a while.

08:58.380 --> 08:59.824
Already signed the lease.

08:59.830 --> 09:00.876
Besides, it's not that far.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.030
It's on Spring Street,
not Seattle.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.076
Does Dad know?

09:05.080 --> 09:06.741
I'll tell him
when he gets back.

09:06.750 --> 09:07.910
[sighs] He is not

09:07.920 --> 09:09.911
gonna like being
kept in the dark.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.160
Maybe you should
just wait.

09:11.170 --> 09:12.785
Mom, it's okay.

09:12.790 --> 09:14.701
We have an understanding.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.536
Moving day's gonna
need a lunch break.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.490
How about we meet up
at Rusty's?

09:22.500 --> 09:23.535
1:30?

09:25.710 --> 09:26.825
1:30.

09:26.830 --> 09:28.036
I'll be there.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.706
No hunt.

09:43.710 --> 09:44.825
No fight.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.820
Men do nothing.

09:47.830 --> 09:49.707
We do a lot of things.

09:54.420 --> 09:55.785
Yeah, beer.

09:55.790 --> 09:57.746
Been

09:57.750 --> 09:58.990
We drink that.

10:07.830 --> 10:09.240
[announcer calling game]

10:09.250 --> 10:11.787
Yeah. We watch that

10:11.790 --> 10:13.326
when we're not working.

10:13.330 --> 10:15.912
Probably a little
too much, actually.

10:19.710 --> 10:22.747
See, sometimes
we hang out with friends.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.035
Maddie friend.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.246
More.

10:30.210 --> 10:33.111
This is my family.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.109
[Levi] Family.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.280
Yeah.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.319
Do you know who that is?

10:41.920 --> 10:43.035
Man I kill.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.826
His name was Sean.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.952
Okay? And this is Xander.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.372
Here. My friend.

10:52.380 --> 10:53.324
My friend.

10:53.330 --> 10:54.536
No.

11:01.460 --> 11:02.916
Hey.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.376
I need to go out
for a little while.

No, no, no, no, no.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.609
I need you to wait here.

11:30.620 --> 11:32.372
All right? I'm going
to talk to someone.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.917
You don't leave the car.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.785
Don't leave car.

11:36.790 --> 11:38.530
-Here.

-wins front-row tickets...
-I'll be right back.

11:42.380 --> 11:44.280

Call in now.

11:44.290 --> 11:45.416
[door locks]

11:48.500 --> 11:50.286
[Ben]
I tried to call.

11:50.290 --> 11:52.952
Yeah, well, I guess
we both have a bad habit

11:52.960 --> 11:55.110
of ignoring each
other's calls then, huh?

11:55.120 --> 11:57.873
I'm sorry.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.871
Things have been... busy.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.825
I heard about your rager,

12:01.830 --> 12:02.819
at the family cabin?

12:04.330 --> 12:06.321
I'm just trying
to keep them safe, Xan.

12:06.330 --> 12:07.991
They still there?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.786
Did you move 'em?

12:09.790 --> 12:11.997
What about the one
who, uh, killed my dad?

12:13.790 --> 12:15.496
He still with 'em?

12:15.500 --> 12:17.707
We should talk.

12:17.710 --> 12:20.611
Xan, like,
really talk this time.

12:20.620 --> 12:21.917
I already said
everything I have to say.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.740
Yeah, I heard you
loud and clear.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.285
But there's a lot
that you don't know.

12:27.290 --> 12:29.030
The male,
he's just a soldier

12:29.040 --> 12:31.031
doing what he's told.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.747
Is that why you
came out here, man?
To defend him?

12:33.750 --> 12:35.957
We were in the wrong place
at the wrong time, Xan,

12:35.960 --> 12:37.825
and that is my fault,
not his.

12:37.830 --> 12:40.242
His family
were being starved out.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.036
Hunted.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.998
Xander, I need you to try
and make peace with this,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.786
because he could
be here for a while.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.417
Your dad was
like a father to me, too.

12:50.420 --> 12:52.069
Stop, man!

12:52.080 --> 12:53.786
Okay?

12:53.790 --> 12:54.916
I said I was cool.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.200
Look, you don't
have to worry about me.

12:58.210 --> 13:01.452
Just gonna stay
out here on my boat.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.911
Go_nna deal with this
In my own way.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.239
That okay with you?

13:10.710 --> 13:12.450
[exhales]

13:35.710 --> 13:36.779
[hatch slams]

13:44.290 --> 13:45.325
[bell jingles]

13:45.330 --> 13:47.537
Oh, early bird
gets the worm.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.826
[Helen] I'm still trying
to figure out

13:55.830 --> 13:58.037
how we have never
bumped Into each other,

13:58.040 --> 13:59.871
living so close
all these years.

14:01.330 --> 14:03.457
I don't really
get out that much. Um...

14:05.540 --> 14:07.030
I don't really fit in.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.996
Me neither.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.039
Even as a little girl,
I knew I was different.

14:13.040 --> 14:16.112
I felt a little bit
like a freak at times.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.997
Yeah, I know what you mean.

14:19.330 --> 14:21.571
My mother.
She lived till she was 90.

14:21.580 --> 14:24.572
Smoked a pack a day,
unfiltered,

14:24.580 --> 14:26.161
just like her attitude.

14:26.170 --> 14:27.159
[both chuckle]

14:28.710 --> 14:30.701
Uh, what about your parents?

14:30.710 --> 14:31.995
My mom died
when I was younger,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.377
and I never
really knew my dad.

14:34.380 --> 14:35.824
I'm so sorry.

14:37.170 --> 14:38.114
Any siblings?

14:38.120 --> 14:39.747
Nah, just me.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.321
[loud thud]

14:42.330 --> 14:45.493
[both hissing]

14:45.500 --> 14:47.286
-[noise continues]
-Um... [clears throat]

14:47.290 --> 14:49.747
mind if I ask
what happened to your mother?

14:49.750 --> 14:51.320
She was an addict.

14:51.330 --> 14:53.116
Um...

14:53.120 --> 14:55.076
things got bad.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.709
Addiction's been
a reoccurring theme
in my family, too.

14:58.710 --> 15:00.166
Genetics, right?

15:00.170 --> 15:01.410
That's probably
why I was blessed with it.

15:01.420 --> 15:02.785
[chuckles]

15:02.790 --> 15:06.703
Addiction, mental illness,

15:06.710 --> 15:09.110
rare autoimmune condition?

15:09.120 --> 15:10.951
Uh-huh.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.378
People in my line

15:16.380 --> 15:19.110
have skin like us.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.997
They say it's this or that.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.991
The cause always changes,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.322
but that's because
they've never really known.

15:26.330 --> 15:28.207
Um, which reminds me.

15:28.210 --> 15:31.748
There's a old family recipe

15:31.750 --> 15:32.876
that does the trick.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.666
I've tried, like...

15:34.670 --> 15:36.376
It's for you.

15:36.380 --> 15:37.369
Try it.

15:37.380 --> 15:38.415
[sniffs]

15:38.420 --> 15:39.705
Strong.

15:39.710 --> 15:41.246
Use it.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.450
Yeah.

15:45.460 --> 15:46.825
Thank you. I gotta--

15:46.830 --> 15:48.411
I'm gonna--
I'm kind of late.

15:48.420 --> 15:49.910
-I'm late for work, so...
-Come back, anytime.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.956
There's
so much more we--

15:51.960 --> 15:54.030
we have to talk about.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.780
[door opens]

15:55.790 --> 16:00.033
You would down
three chili dogs
when you were a kid.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.450
[laughs]

16:01.460 --> 16:02.950
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.747
Yeah, then I discovered
what's in them.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.490
Well,
keep that to yourself,

16:07.500 --> 16:08.740
because they're
still good to me,

16:08.750 --> 16:10.035
and, plus, it's tradition.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.701
Tradition?

16:12.710 --> 16:13.995
Yeah, isn't that why
you picked this place?

16:16.040 --> 16:18.952
When you were a teenager,
I would let you skip school

16:18.960 --> 16:21.281
so that we could have
girls' day, remember?

16:21.290 --> 16:23.246
Matinees, mani-pedis,

16:23.250 --> 16:25.070
capped off with chili dogs
at Rusty's.

16:25.080 --> 16:28.413
Hm. And we
never told your dad.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.956
It was
always our little secret.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.497
Until the principal called
about too many absences.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.741
Cost me a few soccer games.

16:34.750 --> 16:37.241
All right, there's always
someone trying to spoil
a good thing.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.280
-Yeah.
-[cell phone chimes]

16:40.290 --> 16:42.076
If you have to go--

16:42.080 --> 16:43.240
No, no, it's okay.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.411
Well, I want
to give you something.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.240
You didn't have to do that.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.740
I wanted to do it.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.991
Open it.
It isn't much, but just...

16:57.040 --> 16:58.610
This is mine.

16:58.620 --> 17:00.110
I don't understand.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.451
You're giving me
my own necklace?

17:01.460 --> 17:03.451
I went through your things,
I know,

17:03.460 --> 17:04.575
but turn it over.

17:07.380 --> 17:09.166
I had it engraved,

17:09.170 --> 17:11.707
so that we are always
together by your heart.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.326
You don't like it.

17:14.330 --> 17:16.116
No, I do.

17:16.120 --> 17:18.327
It's okay. It's nice.

17:18.330 --> 17:20.116
Thank you.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.450
Hey, you know, uh,

17:42.460 --> 17:45.702
you don't have to do
everything exactly like me.

17:45.710 --> 17:47.951
I know that in the water

17:47.960 --> 17:49.609
you have to listen
to everything
the females say.

17:49.620 --> 17:51.281
Not land.

17:51.290 --> 17:54.612
No. You still need
to listen to women.

17:54.620 --> 17:56.201
That's very important.

17:56.210 --> 18:01.079
You just... You can
be your own person,

18:02.290 --> 18:03.575
if that makes sense.

18:04.790 --> 18:05.996
No.

18:07.210 --> 18:08.245
Don't worry.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.740
You'll learn.

18:46.620 --> 18:49.282
Damn, you got
some strength on you, girl.

18:49.290 --> 18:50.325
You're a force of nature,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.616
like Hurricane Katrina
down there.

18:52.620 --> 18:54.451
Unh! Aah!

18:54.460 --> 18:56.610
[Xander] Don't want
to hurt you, Katrina.

18:56.620 --> 18:58.611
I just want to know
where he is.

19:00.210 --> 19:02.667

19:59.750 --> 20:00.910
[Maddie] Hey.

20:03.080 --> 20:05.241
She shouldn't be doing that.

20:05.250 --> 20:07.161
What is she doing?

20:07.170 --> 20:08.205
She is sad.

20:09.290 --> 20:11.918
She does this to feel better.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.168
I have dream, but

20:16.170 --> 20:17.285
no sleep.

20:17.290 --> 20:19.201
A daydream.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.569
Ben?

20:21.580 --> 20:23.457
Yes.

20:23.460 --> 20:24.666
Why?

20:24.670 --> 20:26.410
He's on your mind.

20:26.420 --> 20:27.876
You care about him.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.700
That's why you can't
stop thinking about him.

20:33.290 --> 20:35.372
I think about Ben.

20:39.620 --> 20:40.666
And you.

who I'm talking about.

You called me.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.530
It was a mistake.

25:01.170 --> 25:03.786
No, I know that sound
in your voice,

25:03.790 --> 25:04.779
like you needed help.

25:04.790 --> 25:07.748
All I want to do is help.

how do you choose, um,

from this guy tonight.

36:30.330 --> 36:32.378
I'm sure you taught
him some things, too.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.450
No listen when women talk.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.530
[laughs]

36:36.540 --> 36:38.326
No, no, no, I--
I didn't say that.

36:39.750 --> 36:41.160
Not hungry?

36:41.170 --> 36:42.489
Oh, I'm good.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.876
Had one for lunch.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.324
Hey, I always
loved that on you.

36:46.670 --> 36:48.490
Yeah. Me, too.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.741
If you can handle them,
I'm gonna swing home.

36:52.750 --> 36:54.706
-Check on my mom.
-Okay.

36:54.710 --> 36:56.416
You want to meet up later?

36:56.420 --> 36:57.876
For sure.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.412
Yeah,
that's your problem.

37:06.420 --> 37:09.321
Right there. That's the reason
you can't go back in the water.

37:10.710 --> 37:13.031
-[hisses]
-No, it's okay.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.371
Take 'em.

37:19.750 --> 37:21.536
If you help me
with my problem,

37:23.330 --> 37:24.615
I'll help you with yours.

37:35.330 --> 37:37.457
You sleep.

37:37.460 --> 37:39.701
I watch.

37:46.540 --> 37:49.202
[Rick] I don't know
what you're trying to tell me.

37:49.210 --> 37:52.782
Uh, there's a reason
that I felt so different,

37:52.790 --> 37:54.417
that you feel different.

37:54.420 --> 37:56.206
Different how?

37:56.210 --> 37:59.168
It's not just other people
we're different from.

37:59.170 --> 38:02.321
We're different
from people, period.

38:04.960 --> 38:08.373
More like hybrids,

38:08.380 --> 38:09.369
genetically.

38:09.380 --> 38:10.950
Kind of like when DNA tests

38:10.960 --> 38:12.825
say that people
are part Neanderthal?

38:12.830 --> 38:16.459
More like when this test
says "unknown."

38:16.460 --> 38:17.825
Okay, okay.

38:17.830 --> 38:20.788
Um, it's getting late.

38:20.790 --> 38:23.076
Oh, hold on.
Don't go anywhere.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.377
I'll be right back.

38:51.210 --> 38:53.997
Uh, I think
the shop's closed.

39:08.290 --> 39:10.281
Telling you
wouldn't have worked.

39:11.670 --> 39:13.877
You have to feel_ it
before you can believe.

39:20.170 --> 39:22.491
[TV playing]

39:24.330 --> 39:26.036
You're still up.

39:26.040 --> 39:27.746
Brought you
a midnight snack.

39:27.750 --> 39:29.286
Plenty of napkins, too.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.531
Soon as Dad gets back,
I want you guys to come over.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.167
See my new place.

39:35.170 --> 39:36.159
Mom.

39:38.670 --> 39:39.705
Hi.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.496
[laughs weakly]

39:41.500 --> 39:43.661
Maddie,
when did you get home?

39:44.920 --> 39:46.285
You're high.

39:46.290 --> 39:47.496
Ohh!

39:51.540 --> 39:53.030
[door opens]

39:53.040 --> 39:54.280
[door closes]

40:10.920 --> 40:14.037
Yeah, I had fun today.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.746
Yes. Fun.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.821
[female singer]
Give me your,
give me your

40:21.830 --> 40:25.072
Hey. Is everything okay?

40:25.080 --> 40:27.321
She's high.

40:27.330 --> 40:29.412
[sniffles]
Using again.

40:29.420 --> 40:31.490
Hey, come here.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.536
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

40:35.580 --> 40:38.617
I'm just glad
I have this place.

40:38.620 --> 40:40.531
And the two of you.

40:42.960 --> 40:47.784
Two for a different dance

40:47.790 --> 40:50.611
I give away for free

40:55.250 --> 40:57.491
Ooh-ooh

40:57.500 --> 40:59.286
Will you kiss me, babe

40:59.290 --> 41:02.111
Thought we had
an understanding

41:07.540 --> 41:10.703
I'll care for you

41:12.080 --> 41:14.992
And you'll care for me

41:19.710 --> 41:24.158
I'll care for you

41:24.170 --> 41:26.741
And you'll care for me

41:31.170 --> 41:33.570
[placid high-pitched call]

41:37.330 --> 41:40.072
[music playing]
