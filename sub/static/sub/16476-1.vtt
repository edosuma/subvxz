WEBVTT

00:03.139 --> 00:05.907
Our system says a man is innocent
until proven guilty.

00:05.908 --> 00:07.274
- Innocent till proven guilty?
- The burden is on the government

00:07.276 --> 00:08.742
- Nobody believes that.
- To prove that you're guilty

00:08.744 --> 00:10.244
- Show me where that's written down.
- Beyond a reasonable doubt.

00:10.246 --> 00:11.979
I-It's called innocent till proven black.

00:11.981 --> 00:13.981
- (people continue talking)
- I believe in our system of justice.

00:13.983 --> 00:15.182
How many people have been taken off

00:15.184 --> 00:17.117
death row because of DNA testing?

00:17.119 --> 00:18.686
20. It's 20 people.

00:18.688 --> 00:20.254
- 20 people that would have died.
- Stop blaming the system.

00:20.256 --> 00:21.922
- There is a better way.
- (overlapping talking continues)

00:21.924 --> 00:24.225
(overlapping talking)

00:24.227 --> 00:27.294
(overlapping talking grows louder)

00:27.296 --> 00:30.431
Rich people don't
play by the same rules.

(indistinct conversation)

00:44.447 --> 00:46.113

00:58.460 --> 01:00.039
(helicopter blades
whirring, excited chattering)

01:00.063 --> 01:01.837
NEWSMAN: <i>Brandon Peters,
the son of tech billionaire</i>

01:01.839 --> 01:04.340
<i>Pete Peters, is set to
be arraigned on charges of...</i>

01:04.342 --> 01:05.408
NEWSWOMAN: <i>...where honor student</i>

01:05.410 --> 01:06.509
<i>Alyssa Yang's body washed ashore.</i>

01:06.511 --> 01:07.677
<i>Alyssa was last seen alive</i>

01:07.679 --> 01:09.078
<i>on a yacht belonging to tech...</i>

01:09.080 --> 01:10.413
NEWSMAN 2: <i>She was strangled
to death while on a yacht</i>

01:10.415 --> 01:11.781
<i>belonging to Pete Peters' company.</i>

01:11.783 --> 01:13.799
<i>Schnoop is expected to
take a huge financial hit.</i>

01:13.800 --> 01:15.890
As surely as the sun rises in the east,

01:15.892 --> 01:18.626
my client will be vindicated,

01:18.628 --> 01:22.296
and we look forward to a full
and fair hearing in open court.

01:22.298 --> 01:24.599
(reporters clamoring, camera
shutters clicking)

01:31.908 --> 01:34.475
(doors opening, closing)

01:35.037 --> 01:36.503
I'm Marissa Morgan.

01:36.505 --> 01:37.938
Pete Peters.

01:37.940 --> 01:40.340
I work with Dr. Bull.

01:40.342 --> 01:43.510
Welcome to Trial Analysis Corporation.

01:43.512 --> 01:45.579
I thought this was jury consulting.

01:45.581 --> 01:49.115
I wouldn't use that
term around Dr. Bull.

01:49.117 --> 01:51.384
What we do here is trial science.

01:51.386 --> 01:53.753
A trial is more than just the law.

01:53.755 --> 01:55.889
It's psychology, neurolinguistics,

01:55.891 --> 01:57.290
demographics.

01:57.292 --> 02:00.026
The way to win is to know your jurors

02:00.028 --> 02:01.261
down to their neurons.

02:01.263 --> 02:02.629
And how exactly do you do that?

02:02.631 --> 02:04.431
I'll show you.

02:04.433 --> 02:08.901
Yes, Brandon Peters had
sex with Alyssa Yang.

02:08.904 --> 02:12.706
That's why the coroner
found his DNA on her body.

02:12.708 --> 02:15.508
(softly): That's our in-house
counsel, Benny Colón.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.644
He's testing your son's defense strategy

02:17.646 --> 02:18.912
in front of a mock jury.

02:18.914 --> 02:21.248
BENNY: Yes, yes.

02:21.250 --> 02:23.316
But the state cannot produce

02:23.318 --> 02:25.785
a single eyewitness that saw

02:25.787 --> 02:27.988
Brandon kill Alyssa Yang.

02:27.990 --> 02:29.923
That is as much a fact

02:29.925 --> 02:32.626
as the rivers that flow to the sea.

02:32.628 --> 02:33.860
Is he...

02:33.862 --> 02:34.995
pretending to be me?

02:34.997 --> 02:37.364
Excuse me...

02:37.366 --> 02:39.532
for a moment.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.034
(whispering): The client is here.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.536
Yes, I see that and he
has brought some lawyers.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.739
MARISSA: Oh, he brought five lawyers.

02:45.741 --> 02:47.774
You know I hate lawyers.

02:47.776 --> 02:51.144
Pete, I wrote that
opening statement and it works.

02:51.146 --> 02:52.979
In lulling people to sleep,

02:52.981 --> 02:55.882
but that's not really what we're after.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.484
Out of this jury pool,

02:57.486 --> 02:59.519
you're gonna get three
not-guilty votes.

02:59.521 --> 03:01.021
Juror number four,

03:01.023 --> 03:02.656
diamond earrings, platinum bracelet.

03:02.658 --> 03:04.624
She is giving Brandon the benefit
of the doubt because

03:04.626 --> 03:06.192
she thinks he's too
pampered to kill anyone.

03:06.194 --> 03:07.193
Juror number seven,

03:07.195 --> 03:09.729
college frat boy. Basically,

03:09.731 --> 03:10.730
wants to be Brandon.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.798
And juror number 11,

03:11.800 --> 03:13.633
our rebel without a cause.

03:13.635 --> 03:15.435
He's siding with Brandon on principle,

03:15.437 --> 03:17.203
but he'll crater under pressure.

03:18.473 --> 03:19.572
Is that right?

03:19.574 --> 03:20.573
Yes.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.242
By a show of hands,

03:22.244 --> 03:24.144
after hearing that opening,

03:24.146 --> 03:25.879
how many find the defendant

03:25.881 --> 03:27.681
not guilty?

03:29.000 --> 03:35.074

03:40.228 --> 03:42.128
Pete Peters.

03:42.130 --> 03:44.064
Dr. Jason Bull.

03:44.066 --> 03:45.598
Can you help my son?

03:45.600 --> 03:47.000
Absolutely.

03:47.002 --> 03:49.102
Hi.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.036
<i>(gavel banging)</i>

03:50.038 --> 03:51.705
The jury starts

03:51.707 --> 03:53.707
with a preconceived idea of the truth.

03:53.709 --> 03:54.808
We don't guess at that.

03:54.810 --> 03:56.910
We deep dive into the jury pool.

03:56.912 --> 03:58.445
We know what they're thinking
from the beginning.

03:58.447 --> 04:01.681
What happened to
innocent until proven guilty?

04:01.683 --> 04:04.050
No trial starts at zero.

04:04.052 --> 04:05.518
MARISSA: Even before jury selection,

04:05.520 --> 04:08.421
TAC profiles every potential juror.

04:08.423 --> 04:09.889
Their behavioral patterns

04:09.891 --> 04:12.225
in life and, especially, online.

04:12.227 --> 04:16.529
What they click on,
likes, keywords, avoidances,

04:16.531 --> 04:18.865
it all gets plugged into
a 400-factor matrix

04:18.867 --> 04:20.500
that is scary

04:20.502 --> 04:22.035
in its predictive efficiency.

04:22.036 --> 04:24.771
We'll know how they'll
vote even before they do.

04:24.773 --> 04:26.773
How do you get that data?

04:26.775 --> 04:29.142
I hired Marissa from the Department
of Homeland Security.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.544
Is there someplace we can sit?

04:31.546 --> 04:33.880
Sure. Here you go.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.952
So... what are

04:38.954 --> 04:40.920
they thinking?

04:40.922 --> 04:42.322
You're a rich jerk.

04:42.324 --> 04:43.256
He's your jerk son

04:43.258 --> 04:44.557
who got everything handed to him.

04:44.559 --> 04:47.026
A trial is not a popularity contest.

04:47.028 --> 04:48.361
Good 'cause they don't like you, either.

04:48.363 --> 04:49.863
Speaking of which, I don't want to see

04:49.865 --> 04:51.431
this army of lawyers again.

04:51.433 --> 04:52.465
Just you.

04:52.467 --> 04:53.533
And her.

04:53.535 --> 04:55.635
I've tried hundreds of cases

04:55.637 --> 04:57.670
without this woo-woo psychology.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.072
PETE: So, what would you do?

04:59.074 --> 05:00.073
RUTLEDGE: No eyewitness.

05:00.075 --> 05:02.108
No murder weapon. Those are the facts.

05:02.110 --> 05:03.410
Try the facts.

05:03.412 --> 05:05.145
BULL: Except we already
tried it 18 times

05:05.147 --> 05:06.546
on the facts,

05:06.548 --> 05:08.014
and we didn't win one.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.683
Well, a mock trial is not a trial.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.285
"Innocent until proven guilty," is like,

05:12.287 --> 05:14.120
"Two all-beef patties,
special sauce, lettuce,

05:14.122 --> 05:17.056
cheese, pickles,
onions on a sesame seed bun."

05:17.058 --> 05:18.858
It's the old jingle.

05:25.801 --> 05:28.368
Do what he says.

05:29.471 --> 05:30.470
(scoffs)

05:30.472 --> 05:32.338
You know, I'm not a monkey...

05:32.340 --> 05:33.473
I like monkeys.

05:33.475 --> 05:34.674
- ...who you can tell to...
- I love monkeys.

05:34.676 --> 05:35.542
They have self-discipline.

05:35.544 --> 05:36.635
Extroverted.

05:36.636 --> 05:37.737
They eat a diverse diet.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.846
I was the Attorney
General of the United States.

05:39.848 --> 05:41.581
Curious George never
said, "I'm not a monkey."

05:41.583 --> 05:43.483
You can't control a trial like this.

05:43.485 --> 05:46.019
You can't.

05:46.021 --> 05:48.888
Things have changed...

05:48.890 --> 05:51.191
but things haven't changed that much.

05:51.193 --> 05:52.225
These are the questions

05:52.227 --> 05:54.494
I want you to ask for the voir dire.

05:58.467 --> 06:00.733
"Why do you catch a cold?"

06:00.735 --> 06:02.268
Hey.

06:02.270 --> 06:03.636
Sorry if it got rough in there.

06:03.638 --> 06:04.904
Somebody has to call the shots.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.407
It's better to be
clear from the beginning.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.442
No hard feelings.

06:11.146 --> 06:12.812
You're a con man.

06:12.814 --> 06:16.182
You conned Peter, but
you haven't conned me.

06:17.953 --> 06:19.619
I love you, man.

06:19.621 --> 06:21.821
(elevator bell chimes)

06:23.692 --> 06:26.059
Good night, Dr. Bull.

06:27.529 --> 06:29.362
Good night.

06:39.374 --> 06:41.174
You want us to bug his watch?

06:41.176 --> 06:42.442
I hate surprises.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.010
DANNY: Clyde's watch.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.512
When Izzie asked me for a divorce,

06:45.514 --> 06:47.080
that was a pleasant surprise...

06:47.082 --> 06:48.581
That's not how I remember it.

06:48.583 --> 06:49.616
She's your sister.

06:49.618 --> 06:50.717
You were married to Benny's sister?

06:50.719 --> 06:52.485
Are we wasting time or
is this team building?

06:52.487 --> 06:53.520
C. Clyde Rutledge,

06:53.522 --> 06:55.188
the former chief law enforcement officer

06:55.190 --> 06:56.222
of the United States.

06:56.224 --> 06:57.757
I remember you cried for weeks

06:57.759 --> 06:59.359
while listening to Harvest

06:59.361 --> 07:01.060
by Neil Young day and night.

07:01.062 --> 07:02.195
When are you gonna stop talking

07:02.197 --> 07:03.464
about my divorce?

07:03.582 --> 07:05.265
Just bug the watch.

07:05.267 --> 07:08.668
"To Clyde: In friendship. Barack."

07:08.670 --> 07:09.669
Rule number one:

07:09.671 --> 07:10.803
the client is the enemy.

07:10.805 --> 07:11.804
Speaking of which,

07:11.806 --> 07:13.573
he didn't show up for witness prep.

07:13.575 --> 07:15.975
He missed three appointments.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.911
Okay, so, we have a
defendant going in front

07:17.913 --> 07:20.213
of a conservative
judge with a boy band haircut

07:20.215 --> 07:21.648
and pimp sneakers.

07:23.752 --> 07:26.219
Do we believe that Brandon

07:26.221 --> 07:28.521
didn't know Alyssa before the party?

07:28.523 --> 07:30.657
Cable, hack into his contacts.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.792
See when he entered her phone number.

07:34.596 --> 07:36.429
He entered her number the first time

07:36.431 --> 07:38.932
the first night of the party.

07:38.934 --> 07:40.266
That's not her number.

07:40.268 --> 07:41.834
Look it up.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.603
Why would Alyssa have two phones?

07:45.106 --> 07:47.373
(reporters clamoring, camera
shutters clicking)

07:48.777 --> 07:49.909
Clyde.

07:49.911 --> 07:52.011
You lost this at my office.

07:53.114 --> 07:54.547
Thank you.

07:54.549 --> 07:57.083
Almost looks like a real Rolex.

07:57.085 --> 07:59.919
The president gave me this watch.

07:59.921 --> 08:01.654
Nixon?

08:05.293 --> 08:07.794
JUDGE: You may proceed with
the questions, counselor.

08:07.796 --> 08:10.563
Why do you catch a cold?

08:10.565 --> 08:12.432
WOMAN: I have two small
children in day care.

08:12.434 --> 08:16.202
They bring home ailments from
all the other children.

08:17.739 --> 08:19.706
Why do you catch a cold?

08:19.708 --> 08:21.407
I'm not gonna answer that.

08:21.409 --> 08:22.375
You have to.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.177
- Tell me about her.
- Put me down

08:24.179 --> 08:26.479
as the juror who won't answer
frivolous questions.

08:26.481 --> 08:27.780
Bess Johnson, 43.

08:27.782 --> 08:29.607
Project accountant, 50 a year.

08:29.608 --> 08:30.409
Divorced.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.385
A son, AJ, 24, gay,

08:32.386 --> 08:34.087
in Dannemora on a drug charge.

08:34.089 --> 08:35.488
Did he get a fair trial?

08:35.490 --> 08:37.256
She has a bumper sticker that says,

08:37.258 --> 08:38.725
"The System is Rigged."

08:38.727 --> 08:41.828
Wow. That's cynical.

08:42.631 --> 08:43.863
BULL: Tell me this moron

08:43.865 --> 08:45.098
isn't gonna strike her for cause.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.650
Your Honor, if the juror
won't answer the question...

08:47.652 --> 08:50.353
General Rutledge, who's the
man who you keep looking to?

08:50.355 --> 08:52.338
The man in the front row.

08:52.340 --> 08:54.440
RUTLEDGE: That's Dr. Bull.

08:54.442 --> 08:57.343
He's a member of the defense team.

08:57.345 --> 09:00.830
Are you gonna challenge this juror?

09:03.018 --> 09:04.851
Acceptable to the defense, Your Honor.

09:04.853 --> 09:07.126
JUDGE: It looks like we have a jury.

09:07.224 --> 09:09.431
Participating in a criminal case

09:09.433 --> 09:11.867
as a juror is an important duty.

09:13.270 --> 09:14.236
I live with my parents.

09:14.238 --> 09:15.404
I live with my parents.

09:15.406 --> 09:16.438
I retired on disability.

09:16.440 --> 09:17.889
I retired on disability.

09:17.891 --> 09:18.907
I just got engaged.

09:18.909 --> 09:20.042
I just got engaged.

09:20.044 --> 09:21.076
I've got a kid in the system.

09:21.078 --> 09:22.844
I have a kid in the system.

09:22.846 --> 09:24.679
We created a mirror jury,

09:24.681 --> 09:27.115
a clone of the jury
that just got picked,

09:27.117 --> 09:29.951
a 94% match in every demographic,

09:29.953 --> 09:31.853
every personal characteristic.

09:31.855 --> 09:33.855
We have them attend the trial every day

09:33.857 --> 09:36.591
along with the actual
jury to hear firsthand

09:36.593 --> 09:39.694
every bit of evidence
and every single testimony.

09:39.696 --> 09:42.330
We then fold their
debrief into what we already know

09:42.332 --> 09:44.499
about each juror's behavioral patterns.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.168
So, what was that about,

09:46.170 --> 09:47.869
"Why do you catch a cold?"

09:47.871 --> 09:50.372
It's called "locus of control."

09:50.374 --> 09:53.575
Rosalind believes that
life is within her control.

09:53.577 --> 09:56.111
Fred think things just happen to him.

09:56.113 --> 09:57.846
We want as many jurors as possible

09:57.848 --> 10:00.015
who see themselves as victims.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.583
But then they'll
identify with the victim.

10:01.585 --> 10:03.618
BULL: No, they'll see
Brandon as the victim.

10:03.620 --> 10:04.719
Victim of what?

10:04.721 --> 10:06.488
Neglectful father.

10:06.490 --> 10:08.190
Absent mother.

10:08.457 --> 10:09.989
The love that they were raised with,

10:09.991 --> 10:13.326
the love they gave their children
that Brandon never got.

10:14.830 --> 10:16.096
Don't take it personally, Pete.

10:16.098 --> 10:17.530
You want to win, right?

10:18.367 --> 10:19.766
So, how does the algorithm

10:19.768 --> 10:21.067
say we're doing?

10:21.069 --> 10:22.235
What's the score?

10:23.138 --> 10:24.704
We've got two votes.

10:24.706 --> 10:25.739
This is ludicrous.

10:25.741 --> 10:27.374
The jury hasn't heard one witness.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.809
So, we need ten more votes?

10:34.816 --> 10:35.882
We need one vote.

10:35.884 --> 10:36.883
In this case,

10:36.885 --> 10:38.351
it could come down to one.

10:38.353 --> 10:40.487
One juror...

10:40.489 --> 10:43.156
who takes control of the jury.

10:43.158 --> 10:46.025
One story, based on the facts or not,

10:46.027 --> 10:49.896
that will persuade that
person to not convict our client.

10:49.898 --> 10:51.264
How do you know it's her?

10:51.266 --> 10:52.866
How do you not know?

10:55.570 --> 11:00.440
Listen... I want to know
every injustice she ever suffered.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.175
Every time she was screwed over.

11:02.177 --> 11:03.743
Every slight, real or imagined.

11:03.745 --> 11:04.978
I want to know

11:04.980 --> 11:06.913
when she didn't get
picked for the kickball team.

11:06.915 --> 11:08.348
I want all of it.

11:08.350 --> 11:09.883
Where are you going with that?

11:11.386 --> 11:13.520
I'm gonna bring your boy home.

11:25.295 --> 11:27.395
These are the contacts from
Alyssa's second phone?

11:27.397 --> 11:28.496
Did you light a candle?

11:28.498 --> 11:29.631
No.

11:29.633 --> 11:31.266
No candles. No flavored coffee.

11:31.268 --> 11:33.134
Did you just break up with someone?

11:33.136 --> 11:34.603
You know what? Next time, how
about you just e-mail me,

11:34.605 --> 11:35.804
okay, Cable?

11:35.806 --> 11:38.840
Do you really want an
illegal hack on your computer?

11:38.842 --> 11:40.041
Peyton Shong.

11:40.043 --> 11:42.310
I know him from when I worked narcotics.

11:42.312 --> 11:45.914
(construction and street noise)

11:45.916 --> 11:47.215
What's up?

11:47.217 --> 11:48.183
How you doing?

11:48.185 --> 11:49.451
(both grunt)

11:49.453 --> 11:52.053
Easy, easy, easy.

11:55.559 --> 11:57.525
PEYTON: <i>Maybe I talked
to her. I don't remember.</i>

11:59.696 --> 12:00.962
You're not gonna eat?

12:00.964 --> 12:03.098
How'd she get invited to that party?

12:03.100 --> 12:04.933
Pretty girls get invited everywhere.

12:04.935 --> 12:08.069
Peyton, don't make me kick your ass.

12:10.674 --> 12:12.173
Lighten up, man.

12:12.175 --> 12:13.575
You used to have a sense of humor.

12:13.577 --> 12:14.876
Breathe, okay?

12:14.878 --> 12:16.611
Look, we're on the
same side on this one.

12:16.613 --> 12:19.481
I just need the information.

12:19.483 --> 12:21.082
Alyssa was smart.

12:21.084 --> 12:23.251
She was careful. She had hustle.

12:23.253 --> 12:24.753
She moved crystal and molly.

12:24.755 --> 12:26.454
She knew all the rich
kids from the clubs.

12:26.456 --> 12:27.889
She got the drugs from you?

12:28.725 --> 12:30.725
At first.

12:30.727 --> 12:33.161
She'd come out on the seven
train when she was 14.

12:33.163 --> 12:34.596
Do her homework on the train.

12:34.598 --> 12:35.997
Then it was an Uber.

12:35.999 --> 12:37.032
Then she...

12:37.034 --> 12:39.300
bought a BMW, found a new supplier.

12:39.302 --> 12:41.803
What aren't you telling me?

12:41.805 --> 12:43.338
She stopped being careful.

12:43.340 --> 12:45.106
She started selling fake molly,

12:45.108 --> 12:46.875
methylone.

12:46.877 --> 12:50.145
With just enough MDMA to
turn the test kits black.

12:50.147 --> 12:52.514
How much fake molly was she moving?

12:52.516 --> 12:54.683
Enough to buy a BMW.

12:56.620 --> 13:00.021
(reporters clamoring)

13:01.258 --> 13:02.891
REPORTER: <i>It's the first day</i>

13:02.893 --> 13:05.326
in the murder trial
that electrified the city.

13:05.328 --> 13:07.796
<i>Brandon Peters, accused of
the murder of Alyssa Yang,</i>

13:07.798 --> 13:10.265
<i>seen here arriving with
his father, Pete Peters.</i>

13:10.267 --> 13:12.400
<i>His mother, the ex-Mrs. Peters,</i>

13:12.402 --> 13:13.668
<i>just arriving.</i>

13:13.670 --> 13:16.237
<i>To the left is her
friend Adele Bensimon,</i>

13:16.239 --> 13:18.339
<i>married to real estate developer</i>

13:18.341 --> 13:19.607
<i>Freddie Bensimon.</i>

13:19.609 --> 13:22.777
(reporters continue clamoring)

13:22.779 --> 13:25.213
(grunts softly)

13:26.416 --> 13:28.116
Hey, Bull.

13:28.118 --> 13:30.318
Jenna.

13:34.925 --> 13:36.758
(shutter clicks)

13:42.199 --> 13:44.466
ATTORNEY: You and
Alyssa's father, you're divorced?

13:44.468 --> 13:46.501
Since Alyssa was 12.

13:46.503 --> 13:49.304
That's my ex-husband,
David, in the front row.

13:49.306 --> 13:51.439
Did you have a good
relationship with your daughter?

13:51.441 --> 13:53.608
After my divorce, especially.

13:53.610 --> 13:55.977
She would talk to me about everything.

13:55.979 --> 13:57.812
She would tell me
that I was the only one

13:57.814 --> 13:59.347
who really understood her.

13:59.349 --> 14:01.716
- She would talk to me...
- My wife used to pull this.

14:01.718 --> 14:03.585
Riding to the defense of the children.

14:03.587 --> 14:05.714
She had to control everything.

14:05.715 --> 14:07.288
MRS. YANG: She said that
she really liked Brandon.

14:07.290 --> 14:09.724
These kids in a divorce are just lost.

14:09.726 --> 14:11.426
MRS. YANG: ...really hit it off.

14:11.428 --> 14:13.728
I know she wanted to sleep with him.

14:13.730 --> 14:15.330
And did they sleep together?

14:15.332 --> 14:17.298
She was 18.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.833
It's normal at that age

14:18.835 --> 14:21.669
- to meet a boy and...
- It's normal to meet a boy and drown?

14:21.671 --> 14:23.371
MRS. YANG: Maybe I should have said no.

14:23.373 --> 14:26.341
And the next time Alyssa called
you, what did she say?

14:26.343 --> 14:28.042
She sounded frightened.

14:28.044 --> 14:30.411
They had sex, but it
wasn't enough for him.

14:30.413 --> 14:32.614
ATTORNEY: What do you mean

14:32.616 --> 14:34.315
"It wasn't enough for him?"

14:34.317 --> 14:35.984
(man coughs)

14:36.820 --> 14:39.754
He wanted to have... anal sex.

14:39.756 --> 14:41.856
(gallery murmuring)

14:42.926 --> 14:44.926
I told her to stay away from Brandon

14:44.928 --> 14:47.295
and that I would call his father.

14:47.297 --> 14:48.296
Which I did.

14:48.298 --> 14:49.931
Did you hear back from Mr. Peters?

14:49.933 --> 14:51.633
Not till two days later.

14:51.635 --> 14:53.468
I got a call from his assistant

14:53.470 --> 14:56.271
to tell me that there
had been an accident.

14:56.273 --> 14:58.133
His assistant called you, not Mr. Peters?

14:58.158 --> 14:59.107
They did a headcount.

14:59.109 --> 15:02.010
They thought she might
have fallen off the boat.

15:02.012 --> 15:03.435
Somebody needs to stick
it to this prick.

15:03.459 --> 15:05.346
He had his assistant
call you to tell you

15:05.348 --> 15:06.748
your daughter was dead.

15:06.750 --> 15:07.715
Objection.

15:07.717 --> 15:09.250
JUDGE: Sustained.

15:09.252 --> 15:11.386
No further questions.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.721
RUTLEDGE: Ms. Yang,

15:13.723 --> 15:15.890
did you know your
daughter was a drug dealer?

15:15.892 --> 15:17.392
That's not true.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.761
RUTLEDGE: Mrs. Yang,

15:19.763 --> 15:21.863
you might learn things in court today.

15:21.865 --> 15:24.132
I just don't like this lawyer.

15:24.134 --> 15:26.000
I don't like the
way he talks down to me.

15:26.002 --> 15:27.535
And did you see the
way he makes his associate

15:27.537 --> 15:28.870
carry all the bags?

15:28.872 --> 15:31.339
RUTLEDGE: Methylenedioxymethamphetamine.

15:31.341 --> 15:32.974
I'm so hungover.

15:32.976 --> 15:34.442
RUTLEDGE: MDMA.

15:34.444 --> 15:35.777
Known as molly.

15:35.779 --> 15:37.412
Alyssa was selling molly

15:37.414 --> 15:39.480
- to Brandon's friends.
- (sighs)

15:39.482 --> 15:40.582
And then she got greedy.

15:40.584 --> 15:42.951
Blame the victim, you misogynistic jerk.

15:42.953 --> 15:45.453
RUTLEDGE: She sold
them fake molly, methylone.

15:46.245 --> 15:47.889
Isn't it possible someone found out?

15:47.891 --> 15:49.657
BULL: She hates Rutledge.

15:49.659 --> 15:51.125
Bess hasn't heard a word he's said.

15:51.127 --> 15:53.394
RUTLEDGE: Isn't it possible

15:53.396 --> 15:56.464
she sold fake molly to the wrong person

15:56.466 --> 15:58.066
and that is what got her killed?

15:58.068 --> 15:59.567
My daughter was a good girl.

15:59.569 --> 16:01.302
- (gallery murmuring)
- An "A" student!

16:01.304 --> 16:03.037
- And you are making it seem...
- JUDGE: (bangs gavel) Quiet, please.

16:03.039 --> 16:05.106
RUTLEDGE: You can't
judge a book by its cover,

16:05.108 --> 16:07.876
can you, Mrs. Yang?

16:07.878 --> 16:11.279
I don't think you
knew your daughter at all.

16:11.281 --> 16:13.147
Pig.

16:13.149 --> 16:14.616
RUTLEDGE: No further questions.

16:14.618 --> 16:16.484
JUDGE: Court is in recess till Monday.

16:16.486 --> 16:18.586
(gavel banging, gallery murmuring)

16:30.467 --> 16:33.434
(sniffles, chuckles)

16:33.436 --> 16:34.969
You travel with these?

16:34.971 --> 16:36.704
I'm a psychologist.

16:36.706 --> 16:38.840
Lifetime supply comes with the license.

16:38.842 --> 16:41.009
Pete told me about you.

16:41.011 --> 16:42.443
Thinks you're some kind of magician.

16:42.445 --> 16:44.712
So far, I haven't seen it.

16:44.714 --> 16:46.414
You think it's okay if
I take another Xanax?

16:46.416 --> 16:47.849
I've already taken three.

16:47.851 --> 16:49.350
I'd go easy on that.

16:49.352 --> 16:51.352
I'll just take half.

16:51.354 --> 16:52.887
Pace yourself, Gail.

16:52.889 --> 16:57.091
It gets a lot worse before
it gets better.

16:57.093 --> 17:00.261
He doesn't even have a
relationship with Brandon.

17:00.263 --> 17:01.496
Did he tell you that?

17:01.498 --> 17:03.131
Pete got him an apartment

17:03.133 --> 17:07.435
when he was 16 and
basically just stopped seeing him.

17:07.436 --> 17:09.337
Hadn't seen him for a
year before the party.

17:09.339 --> 17:12.573
(sighs deeply)

17:12.575 --> 17:15.410
I came here for witness prep.

17:15.412 --> 17:16.577
At Versailles,

17:16.579 --> 17:19.981
a strategically placed beauty
mark said, "Kiss me."

17:19.983 --> 17:23.417
For us, it's what kind
of jeans do you wear?

17:23.420 --> 17:25.987
Your clothes, your
hair, glasses, jewelry,

17:25.989 --> 17:29.057
it's all a code we use
to talk to each other.

17:29.059 --> 17:30.591
I don't need clothes.

17:30.593 --> 17:31.659
I have clothes.

17:31.661 --> 17:32.994
(chuckles)

17:32.996 --> 17:35.496
BULL: <i>Brandon, never argue
with a stylist from Vogue.</i>

17:35.498 --> 17:37.098
You can call me Chunk.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.399
And I'm Dr. Jason Bull.

17:38.401 --> 17:40.101
It's time we had a talk,
don't you think?

17:41.538 --> 17:43.604
Why are you smirking?

17:43.606 --> 17:45.139
- I'm not smirking.
- Did you see that?

17:45.141 --> 17:46.975
- He smirked, he's a smirker.
- Hmm.

17:46.977 --> 17:48.810
It's between a snigger and a leer.

17:48.812 --> 17:51.145
They're not going to convict
me because of my haircut.

17:51.147 --> 17:54.115
No, but they ought to
hang you for being a dick.

17:54.117 --> 17:57.285
You do realize
there's dozens of people here

17:57.287 --> 17:59.527
working around the clock to
save you from life in prison?

18:00.991 --> 18:02.590
Look, Dr. Bull...

18:02.592 --> 18:04.092
Dr. Bull is too formal.

18:04.094 --> 18:06.327
Okay, Jason...

18:06.329 --> 18:07.462
"Jason"? Wow.

18:07.464 --> 18:09.197
- I was thinking "boss."
- "Boss"?

18:09.199 --> 18:10.431
I like "boss."

18:10.433 --> 18:11.799
Call me "boss."

18:11.801 --> 18:13.611
My dad says I don't have to testify.

18:13.752 --> 18:17.105
93% of all communication is nonverbal.

18:17.107 --> 18:19.974
You've been testifying since day one.

18:19.976 --> 18:23.177
CHUNK: I'm gonna get these
measurements to the tailor.

18:23.179 --> 18:24.746
(chuckles)

18:27.150 --> 18:29.684
Did you kill Alyssa?

18:29.686 --> 18:30.718
No.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.286
But you did have sex with her.

18:32.288 --> 18:34.489
They can believe
whatever they want to believe.

18:34.491 --> 18:35.857
Is there any reason anyone

18:35.859 --> 18:38.793
would have seen you with her
at the time she was strangled?

18:38.795 --> 18:40.228
No, I wasn't with her.

18:40.230 --> 18:41.763
Then where were you?

18:41.765 --> 18:42.997
To be honest with you,

18:42.999 --> 18:45.466
I don't even remember leaving my room.

18:45.468 --> 18:47.035
I had too much to drink.

18:47.037 --> 18:49.203
We all did.

18:50.774 --> 18:51.739
I don't know yet

18:51.741 --> 18:53.941
exactly what happened on that boat

18:53.943 --> 18:56.110
and I don't know if
you're lying about what happened

18:56.112 --> 18:57.979
between you and Alyssa,

18:57.981 --> 19:01.783
but I do know you're
lying about something.

19:01.785 --> 19:04.540
You're supposed to be on my side.

19:04.663 --> 19:08.322
I may be the only one who is.

19:19.010 --> 19:20.818
She's a naturally dominant personality.

19:20.820 --> 19:23.387
She has lunch every day
with Rosalind and Sarah.

19:23.389 --> 19:25.055
See how she keeps her hands on her hips?

19:25.057 --> 19:26.824
Goes through doors first.

19:26.826 --> 19:28.425
Sustains eye contact.

19:28.427 --> 19:30.127
They look up to her.

19:30.129 --> 19:31.795
Even Frank likes her.

19:31.797 --> 19:34.131
- She connects all the dots.
- She doesn't fit the analytics.

19:34.133 --> 19:35.966
- I got a hunch about her.
- She'll make up her mind

19:35.968 --> 19:37.301
and won't be swayed.

19:37.303 --> 19:39.136
By you or anyone.

19:39.138 --> 19:40.838
You were right.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.574
Brandon was hiding something.

19:43.576 --> 19:44.842
Where'd you get this?

19:44.844 --> 19:46.977
I went through
everyone's photos, all of them,

19:46.979 --> 19:48.712
even the Snapchat.

19:48.714 --> 19:49.913
There were 30,000.

19:49.915 --> 19:52.182
- Sleep much?
- 20 minute nap every four hours.

19:52.184 --> 19:54.385
Polyphasic sleep, in the
long run, it saves you 20 years.

19:54.387 --> 19:55.586
I see.

19:55.588 --> 19:57.521
But this wasn't on Brandon's phone.

19:57.523 --> 19:58.756
No, but they're Brandon's.

19:58.758 --> 20:01.992
Look at the monogram, that's
Brandon's stateroom.

20:01.994 --> 20:04.395
(sighs, chuckles)

20:04.397 --> 20:06.563
You know, I was just sitting here,

20:06.565 --> 20:08.032
wishing this case was more complicated,

20:08.034 --> 20:09.466
and then you show up,

20:09.468 --> 20:10.868
as if sent by
heaven, with our defendant's

20:10.870 --> 20:13.070
contemporaneous photos of an arcane

20:13.072 --> 20:15.039
Japanese bondage ritual.

20:16.208 --> 20:17.474
Nice knots.

20:17.476 --> 20:18.642
(with accent): Summers
at the yacht club.

20:18.644 --> 20:19.777
(scoffs)

20:19.779 --> 20:21.378
Tell me this isn't Brandon's.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.414
- It's not admissible.
- Brandon and Alyssa had sex with ropes.

20:23.416 --> 20:25.527
She turns up strangled to death.

20:25.657 --> 20:27.251
How is that not admissible?

20:27.253 --> 20:28.318
Ah.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.787
Mr. Palmer, care to weigh in

20:29.789 --> 20:31.422
on Brandon's party antics?

20:31.424 --> 20:32.556
Wow.

20:32.558 --> 20:34.224
I love the manicure.

20:34.226 --> 20:36.627
Alyssa was a nail biter, it's
in the coroner's report.

20:36.629 --> 20:38.028
No, not with those nails.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.029
Half-moon nails?

20:39.031 --> 20:40.030
That's a vintage look

20:40.032 --> 20:42.199
from the '40s.

20:44.403 --> 20:46.870
It's not admissible 'cause
it's not Alyssa.

20:46.872 --> 20:49.440
And you win a free meal at
the Arby's of your choice.

20:49.442 --> 20:52.376
He hooked up with two
girls on the yacht?

20:52.378 --> 20:54.812
How do I get invited to
a high school party?

20:54.814 --> 20:56.213
Kidding.

20:58.751 --> 21:00.384
ADELE: Taylor is fragile.

21:00.386 --> 21:02.920
Of course I explained how
close Brandon and Taylor are.

21:02.922 --> 21:04.822
Our daughter had
nothing to do with this.

21:04.824 --> 21:06.623
GAIL: We were all close.

21:06.625 --> 21:08.058
We vacationed together.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.760
We'd imagine how the kids

21:09.762 --> 21:11.995
would get married one day.

21:11.997 --> 21:13.263
Taylor and Brandon.

21:13.265 --> 21:14.832
You know all about delusions, Mr. Wool.

21:14.834 --> 21:15.866
Dr. Bull.

21:15.868 --> 21:16.900
All the pretty dreams

21:16.902 --> 21:18.402
from long, long ago.

21:18.404 --> 21:20.237
These your initials?

21:20.239 --> 21:21.638
"AB"?

21:21.640 --> 21:24.508
Taylor gets so unhappy, it's unbearable.

21:24.510 --> 21:26.777
She asked me to get this girl invited.

21:26.779 --> 21:28.712
It was a very small guest list.

21:28.714 --> 21:30.380
But she moped and moped and...

21:30.382 --> 21:31.615
well, you can't say it,

21:31.617 --> 21:34.118
but you know how pushy Asian girls are.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.320
GAIL: I remember when you called me.

21:36.322 --> 21:38.288
ADELE: It's so typical of
how clueless Taylor is.

21:38.290 --> 21:40.257
I knew that girl was trouble.

21:40.259 --> 21:42.359
We were there, we
watched the whole thing happen.

21:42.361 --> 21:44.161
You were all on the yacht?

21:44.163 --> 21:45.896
Honestly, I think the
only reason that girl

21:45.898 --> 21:48.031
befriended Taylor was to get to Brandon.

21:48.033 --> 21:51.068
I told Taylor, you need to
tell her Brandon is yours.

21:51.070 --> 21:52.703
Mrs. Bensimon,

21:52.705 --> 21:54.750
do you realize this
is your daughter, Taylor,

21:54.752 --> 21:55.806
in this photograph?

21:57.610 --> 21:59.143
With Brandon?

22:02.081 --> 22:04.648
Well, as long as it was with Brandon.

22:06.085 --> 22:08.051
- Oh, hi.
- Hello, darling.

22:08.053 --> 22:10.354
ADELE: Taylor, honey, this is Dr. Bill.

22:10.356 --> 22:11.455
- Dr. Bull.
- He's working

22:11.457 --> 22:13.090
with Brandon's lawyers.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.726
Cool.

22:16.362 --> 22:18.695
Excuse me for a second.

22:18.697 --> 22:19.930
Oh.

22:19.932 --> 22:21.265
BULL: Taylor?

22:23.769 --> 22:27.104
♪ Ain't coming ♪

22:27.106 --> 22:29.973
Hey. Can I ask you a few questions?

22:29.975 --> 22:33.977
We really don't want
Taylor getting hurt by this.

22:33.979 --> 22:35.212
I'm afraid you have to leave.

22:35.214 --> 22:37.014
♪ Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪

22:37.016 --> 22:38.382
Huh.

22:38.384 --> 22:44.655

get used to the rain ♪

22:44.657 --> 22:49.560

22:49.562 --> 22:52.129
♪ My heart ♪

22:52.131 --> 22:53.931

22:53.933 --> 22:56.900
When did Taylor find out that
you and Alyssa slept together?

22:56.902 --> 22:59.069
I tell Taylor everything.

22:59.071 --> 23:00.182
You told her?

23:00.183 --> 23:02.091
I had a friend like that, growing up.

23:02.092 --> 23:03.707
Who you confided in and hog-tied

23:03.709 --> 23:05.008
with Japanese bondage ropes?

23:05.010 --> 23:07.311
She wanted to do that.

23:07.313 --> 23:08.712
She wanted to?

23:08.714 --> 23:09.846
You don't understand.

23:09.848 --> 23:12.616
You sleep with any girl who asks?

23:13.619 --> 23:15.385
Why are you looking at me like that?

23:15.387 --> 23:17.721
I didn't do anything wrong.

23:17.723 --> 23:19.656
MARISSA: Dr. Bull?

23:19.658 --> 23:21.225
Can I see you for a minute?

23:26.198 --> 23:29.099
Why is he asking all
these questions about Taylor?

23:30.002 --> 23:31.268
Are you worried about Taylor?

23:31.270 --> 23:34.215
The photos I took of
Taylor weren't sexual.

23:34.642 --> 23:39.142
36% of Americans use masks,
blindfolds and bondage tools.

23:39.144 --> 23:40.869
Which makes handcuffs in bed

23:40.870 --> 23:42.620
more popular than either
political party.

23:42.621 --> 23:43.506
Uh-huh.

23:43.507 --> 23:45.148
And it corresponds
with such positive traits

23:45.150 --> 23:47.651
as extroversion, openness,
and conscientiousness.

23:47.653 --> 23:49.686
Is this why you called
me out of my meeting?

23:49.688 --> 23:51.488
Those photos got leaked to the papers.

23:55.227 --> 23:57.928
He said those pictures weren't sexual.

23:58.797 --> 23:59.896
They're not sexual?

23:59.898 --> 24:01.064
Mm-mm.

24:04.703 --> 24:07.337
(grunting, panting)

24:07.339 --> 24:08.639
Let me help you, Liberty.

24:08.641 --> 24:11.008
(sighs): Why, thank you, kind sir.

24:11.010 --> 24:14.077
Self-reliance, that's
my motto. Do it yourself.

24:19.852 --> 24:22.753
RUTLEDGE: Taylor, with
all the prescription drugs

24:22.755 --> 24:23.920
you currently take,

24:23.922 --> 24:25.856
did the doctor or the pharmacist

24:25.858 --> 24:29.693
tell you not to take street drugs?

24:30.562 --> 24:32.896
It's not recommended.

24:32.898 --> 24:35.766
But wasn't Alyssa Yang your drug dealer?

24:35.768 --> 24:36.969
Yes.

24:36.970 --> 24:38.135
RUTLEDGE: You were
the one who got Alyssa

24:38.137 --> 24:39.936
invited to this party?

24:39.938 --> 24:42.639
TAYLOR: My mother...
my favorite person...

24:42.641 --> 24:44.741
Called Brandon's mother as a favor,

24:44.743 --> 24:46.576
because I asked her to.

24:46.578 --> 24:48.578
RUTLEDGE: You even
loaned her a necklace.

24:48.580 --> 24:51.448
It's a necklace my mother gave me...

24:51.586 --> 24:52.949
Amethysts in rose gold...

24:52.951 --> 24:55.018
It belonged to my grandmother.

24:55.020 --> 24:56.420
Was there a necklace on the body?

24:56.422 --> 24:57.654
RUTLEDGE: Can you read this...

24:57.656 --> 24:59.856
text message you sent Alyssa?

25:02.161 --> 25:04.895
"Keep your hands off
Brandon. Brandon's mine."

25:04.897 --> 25:06.863
And then they slept together.

25:07.733 --> 25:09.599
I was surprised.

25:09.601 --> 25:11.668
I never heard of
Brandon hooking up with anyone.

25:11.670 --> 25:12.903
She didn't seem like his type.

25:12.905 --> 25:15.105
RUTLEDGE: Weren't you angry?

25:15.107 --> 25:17.974
Why do you keep trying
to twist everything I say?

25:17.976 --> 25:20.711
RUTLEDGE: You wrote
Brandon a text message.

25:20.713 --> 25:25.248
Perhaps this will refresh
your recollection.

25:25.250 --> 25:27.684
(sighs)

25:30.379 --> 25:31.888
(Taylor scoffs)

25:31.890 --> 25:35.158
If you had seen Problem Child 2,

25:35.160 --> 25:36.993
you would know what this was.

25:36.995 --> 25:40.397
Would you please read what
you wrote, Ms. Bensimon?

25:44.670 --> 25:46.503
"The bitch must die."

25:48.040 --> 25:49.506
(gallery murmuring)

25:49.508 --> 25:50.841
RUTLEDGE: Where were you

25:50.843 --> 25:54.644
between 1:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m.

25:54.646 --> 25:57.080
when Alyssa Yang was murdered?

25:57.082 --> 25:59.850
Asleep in my room.

25:59.852 --> 26:01.718
Did anyone see you?

26:01.720 --> 26:03.820
I was asleep.

26:03.822 --> 26:05.422
RUTLEDGE: You had motive.

26:05.424 --> 26:07.724
You had opportunity.

26:07.726 --> 26:09.159
Isn't it possible

26:09.161 --> 26:12.562
you killed Alyssa?

26:14.666 --> 26:16.066
- (yells)
- (gasping)

26:16.068 --> 26:17.033
- Oh!
- (gavel banging)

26:17.035 --> 26:18.001
JUDGE: Quiet in the court!

26:18.003 --> 26:19.736
(gallery murmuring)

26:19.738 --> 26:22.239
Didn't see that coming.

26:25.411 --> 26:26.410
(handcuffs jingling)

26:26.412 --> 26:27.677
Taylor.

26:27.679 --> 26:29.846
MAN (over radio): Eagle coming
out of the courthouse.

26:29.848 --> 26:31.648
MAN 2 (over radio): Transpo
en route. 30 seconds out.

26:31.650 --> 26:32.716
MAN: Watch your six.

26:32.718 --> 26:34.084
The dead girl's father is approaching

26:34.086 --> 26:35.685
in a blue windbreaker.

26:35.687 --> 26:37.254
MAN 2: Eyes on target.
Eyes on the prize.

26:37.256 --> 26:38.455
Secure the perimeter.

26:39.024 --> 26:40.991
(gunshots)

26:40.993 --> 26:44.027
(panicked clamoring)

26:54.016 --> 26:56.409
But don't you see what
a break this is for us?

26:57.008 --> 26:59.369
Clyde wants to move for a mistrial.

26:59.371 --> 27:02.472
Well, this might be the
first time we get a fair trial.

27:02.474 --> 27:05.509
Now that Wyatt Earp has put
some points on the board,

27:05.511 --> 27:07.517
they can stop using your
son to stick it to you.

27:07.518 --> 27:09.379
The jury saw the whole thing.

27:09.381 --> 27:11.748
How is that not grounds for a mistrial?

27:11.750 --> 27:13.083
Well, he missed.

27:13.085 --> 27:15.852
Mostly.

27:15.854 --> 27:18.155
We have a hung jury,

27:18.157 --> 27:19.766
according to your data.

27:19.767 --> 27:20.979
Then we go again.

27:20.981 --> 27:22.447
A-Another trial?

27:22.449 --> 27:25.017
Half the time with a hung
jury, the D.A. drops it.

27:26.954 --> 27:28.720
What if he's guilty?

27:32.292 --> 27:33.492
What does Brandon say?

27:33.494 --> 27:36.962
Have you even spoken to your son?

27:36.964 --> 27:40.165
He'll do what I tell him to do.

27:40.167 --> 27:42.567
He always has.

27:43.604 --> 27:46.038
You basically told him he
wasn't worth your time

27:46.040 --> 27:49.541
and he has lived up to
those expectations.

27:53.580 --> 27:56.882
Tell me he didn't do this.

27:59.753 --> 28:02.487
(computers trilling, phones ringing)

28:02.489 --> 28:03.922
I just watched the mirror jury

28:03.924 --> 28:06.258
deliberate for two and a half hours.

28:06.260 --> 28:07.592
We're losing.

28:07.594 --> 28:09.227
I like a challenge.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.696
It's one of the ten traits
of highly successful people.

28:11.698 --> 28:13.698
Hmm.

28:16.470 --> 28:20.405
A victim wants a caretaker.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.774
These people...

28:22.776 --> 28:24.643
are all linked...

28:24.645 --> 28:26.078
to Bess.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.180
We still don't have her.

28:31.652 --> 28:32.984
Her son,

28:32.986 --> 28:37.122
AJ, went through life
looking for the father he never had.

28:39.827 --> 28:41.693
Just like Brandon

28:41.695 --> 28:45.831
went through life looking for
the father he never had.

28:45.833 --> 28:48.934
When Bess sees
Brandon, she sees her son, AJ.

28:48.936 --> 28:52.237
Bess's second chance to
save her son, through Brandon.

28:52.239 --> 28:53.705
Can I talk to you?

28:53.707 --> 28:55.607
Would you mind taking your earbuds out?

28:55.609 --> 28:58.410
"While employers believe
it's rude to wear earbuds

28:58.412 --> 29:00.345
in the workplace, millennials
are using them

29:00.347 --> 29:02.414
to focus and be more productive."

29:02.416 --> 29:03.915
It's in our HR manual.

29:03.917 --> 29:05.684
Too long, didn't read.

29:05.686 --> 29:08.286
Remember we put that
bug in Clyde's watch?

29:08.288 --> 29:10.322
He's meeting with the D.A.

29:10.324 --> 29:12.457
You don't have Singapore Ear, do you?

29:12.459 --> 29:15.427
He's taking a deal... Second
degree manslaughter.

29:15.429 --> 29:18.997
He's gonna plead Brandon guilty.

29:18.999 --> 29:21.433
I want Brandon downstairs.

29:21.435 --> 29:23.435
- (door opens)
- Hey.

29:23.437 --> 29:25.704
Don't mind him, I
borrowed him from the law firm.

29:25.706 --> 29:27.639
Earbuds, Josh.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.741
It just means whatever
we say in here is protected

29:29.743 --> 29:31.343
under attorney-client privilege.

29:31.345 --> 29:32.444
Why are we meeting down here?

29:32.446 --> 29:33.545
Take a seat.

29:33.547 --> 29:34.646
Why?

29:34.648 --> 29:36.114
Just have a seat.

29:36.116 --> 29:38.550
I'm not gonna testify.

29:38.552 --> 29:39.751
Do you like Nutraloaf?

29:39.753 --> 29:41.686
My father said I'm gonna take a deal.

29:41.688 --> 29:42.654
'Cause that's what you're
gonna be eating

29:42.656 --> 29:44.789
for the next ten years.

29:47.594 --> 29:49.194
Forget it.

29:49.196 --> 29:50.162
I'm not doing it.

29:50.164 --> 29:51.997
(scoffs) Now is not the time

29:51.999 --> 29:55.268
to bail on yourself just
because Daddy is.

29:56.069 --> 29:58.870
I know, Brandon. I've
been down that road.

29:58.872 --> 30:00.372
Yeah, right.

30:00.374 --> 30:03.608
I... I mean, everybody respects you.

30:03.610 --> 30:06.178
Even my dad says you're the best.

30:06.180 --> 30:08.680
Your dad...

30:15.856 --> 30:18.156
Dads...

30:20.961 --> 30:25.030
If a father never said, "I love you,"

30:25.032 --> 30:26.932
right?

30:26.934 --> 30:29.201
Never.

30:31.405 --> 30:33.972
Never said, "I'm proud of you."

30:35.976 --> 30:38.243
Couldn't say it.

30:41.348 --> 30:44.015
'Cause he didn't believe it.

30:44.017 --> 30:45.917
Then who's the failure?

30:45.919 --> 30:49.421
The father or the son?

30:52.893 --> 30:55.227
Look in the mirror

30:55.229 --> 30:58.663
and be the man your father never was.

30:58.665 --> 31:02.467
Give yourself what you
wish you could get

31:02.469 --> 31:05.270
from somebody else.

31:06.139 --> 31:09.207
I'll be right there with you.

31:11.445 --> 31:14.212
(sighs)

31:14.214 --> 31:17.616
Sometimes I feel like
this whole thing...

31:17.618 --> 31:20.085
you know, like...

31:20.087 --> 31:22.954
like I'm watching it
happen to somebody else.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.460
I know you're gay, Brandon.

31:29.296 --> 31:31.863
I've known for a long time.

31:31.865 --> 31:33.331
And it's nothing to be ashamed of.

31:33.333 --> 31:36.167
(chuckles) It's who you are.

31:37.037 --> 31:39.904
(exhales deeply)

31:39.906 --> 31:41.439
How did you know?

31:42.876 --> 31:44.409
I didn't even know.

31:44.411 --> 31:47.412
Isn't that where you were the
night Alyssa was murdered?

31:47.414 --> 31:51.750
Somewhere else,
with someone else, doing...

31:52.586 --> 31:54.286
...something else?

31:58.392 --> 31:59.891
Does my father know?

31:59.893 --> 32:02.260
Your father just made a deal

32:02.262 --> 32:03.928
to put you in prison for ten years.

32:03.930 --> 32:05.297
Did he even ask you?

32:15.942 --> 32:18.476
(breathes shakily)

32:25.285 --> 32:28.486
(sniffles)

32:30.557 --> 32:32.424
You can do this.

32:33.627 --> 32:35.894
(nervous sigh)

32:38.799 --> 32:40.632
They're not going to believe me.

32:40.634 --> 32:42.801
Hey...

32:42.803 --> 32:45.203
don't give up on people.

32:45.205 --> 32:47.405
They're all we've got.

32:49.910 --> 32:51.976
- Speak up.
- Answer directly.

32:51.978 --> 32:53.078
Keep your hands still.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.012
BENNY: Don't slouch.

32:54.014 --> 32:55.080
MARISSA: Respond only to questions,

32:55.082 --> 32:56.214
not statements.

32:56.216 --> 32:59.017
- Don't fill silences.
- Don't smoke on breaks.

32:59.019 --> 33:00.385
It's not enough to tell the truth.

33:00.387 --> 33:01.787
You have to tell the truth effectively.

33:01.788 --> 33:04.089
I gotta get this to my
boss. He'll need time to prepare.

33:04.091 --> 33:05.757
Clyde's not doing the direct, you are.

33:05.759 --> 33:07.225
(Benny chokes, coughs)

33:07.227 --> 33:09.027
What? Does he know that?

33:09.029 --> 33:11.863
(scoffs) My read on the
women on this jury is

33:11.865 --> 33:13.898
they hate your boss.

33:13.900 --> 33:15.767
If we spring you on them,

33:15.769 --> 33:18.970
they just may rally to
vote for you, Liberty,

33:18.972 --> 33:21.005
rather than against Brandon.

33:24.444 --> 33:26.878
I'm the client, right? I'll tell him.

33:42.037 --> 33:44.238
LIBERTY: Brandon...

33:45.041 --> 33:46.841
I want you to direct your attention

33:46.843 --> 33:48.643
to the night in question.

33:49.512 --> 33:51.846
Were you with Alyssa Yang that night?

33:51.848 --> 33:53.347
Yes, I was.

33:53.349 --> 33:56.550
And on a previous night,
did you have sex with her?

33:56.552 --> 33:58.552
Yes.

33:58.554 --> 34:00.721
Did you argue about sex?

34:02.458 --> 34:04.291
I didn't want to have
sex with her again.

34:04.293 --> 34:06.093
It was a mistake.

34:06.095 --> 34:07.328
Did something go wrong?

34:07.330 --> 34:09.230
It's a mistake to do everything in life

34:09.232 --> 34:11.465
because of what other
people expect you to.

34:11.467 --> 34:13.534
LIBERTY: You're a healthy young man.

34:13.536 --> 34:15.670
She was a beautiful young girl.

34:15.672 --> 34:17.705
Why not?

34:17.706 --> 34:19.440
Well, my parents kept asking me why

34:19.442 --> 34:20.675
I didn't have a girlfriend,

34:20.677 --> 34:23.444
and Alyssa was one of the
hottest girls around

34:23.446 --> 34:25.980
and an "A" student who could, you know,

34:25.982 --> 34:27.380
go to Oxford.

34:27.382 --> 34:30.518
So that was, like, a
perfect picture, and...

34:30.520 --> 34:33.654
at a certain point you get tired

34:33.656 --> 34:36.257
of disappointing everyone.

34:38.094 --> 34:40.960
So what was wrong with
the perfect picture?

34:46.402 --> 34:47.935
I'm gay.

34:49.205 --> 34:51.205
(quiet murmuring)

34:52.308 --> 34:54.608
Is that where you were
between 1:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m.?

34:56.879 --> 34:58.612
Yes.

34:58.614 --> 35:00.081
I was with someone.

35:00.883 --> 35:03.217
LIBERTY: Brandon, I have to ask you...

35:04.220 --> 35:06.353
...who were you with?

35:06.355 --> 35:10.091
Look, I mean no
disrespect to you or anyone,

35:10.093 --> 35:12.026
but I'm not gonna answer that.

35:12.028 --> 35:15.329
I said what I've
said, and I'm not sorry,

35:15.331 --> 35:17.565
but I'm not gonna do
this to someone else.

35:17.567 --> 35:20.901
Brandon, now is not the
time to be a hero.

35:20.903 --> 35:22.870
I've told you
everything you need to know.

35:24.574 --> 35:27.041
Brandon, did you kill Alyssa Yang?

35:27.043 --> 35:29.844
- No.
- Save yourself.

35:29.846 --> 35:32.246
Tell this jury who you were with.

35:32.248 --> 35:34.849
You just want...

35:34.851 --> 35:36.517
You want to break it all apart.

35:36.519 --> 35:38.786
Break everything!

35:38.788 --> 35:41.222
(shouting) You're
supposed to be the adults!

35:41.224 --> 35:43.624
(whispering and murmuring)

35:43.626 --> 35:45.760
(gavel banging)

35:45.762 --> 35:47.895
JUDGE: Quiet, please!

35:49.866 --> 35:51.766
(gavel banging)

35:54.771 --> 35:58.472
We have no further questions, Your Honor.

36:00.009 --> 36:01.442
So you didn't tell the police

36:01.444 --> 36:02.710
you were with someone that night?

36:02.712 --> 36:04.678
- No.
- You lied to the police.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.947
- Objection.
- I'll withdraw the question.

36:07.950 --> 36:10.451
You admit you had sex with Alyssa.

36:10.453 --> 36:13.287
Your DNA was found in her body.

36:13.289 --> 36:15.523
- You were never gay before...
- I was always gay! I...

36:15.525 --> 36:17.691
And now that your
trial isn't going so well...

36:17.693 --> 36:20.561
do you really
expect this jury to believe

36:20.563 --> 36:22.797
that you were with a secret,
gay, mystery lover

36:22.799 --> 36:24.298
who you refuse to name?

36:25.568 --> 36:28.536
I just didn't think it was
really up to me to be happy.

36:28.538 --> 36:29.770
Your refusal is answer enough.

36:29.772 --> 36:31.105
I'll withdraw the question.

36:31.107 --> 36:33.174
No further questions.

36:40.183 --> 36:42.116
- How did I do?
- Well...

36:42.118 --> 36:43.984
you're not done yet.

36:45.254 --> 36:47.321
I'm doing the closing argument, too?

36:47.323 --> 36:49.523
Well, the real
closing arguments take place

36:49.525 --> 36:51.258
behind the jury room door.

36:51.260 --> 36:52.593
Always.

36:53.896 --> 36:57.431
And our research shows that
Bess will deliver it.

36:58.467 --> 37:03.103
Bess... who carries a
terrible burden of guilt

37:03.105 --> 37:06.073
for failing her own son.

37:06.075 --> 37:08.442
You can free her from that.

37:09.312 --> 37:11.178
Can you do it?

37:20.990 --> 37:24.558
Brandon Peters did not kill Alyssa Yang.

37:25.628 --> 37:28.662
People know the truth when they hear it.

37:28.664 --> 37:31.532
That's why we say it has a ring.

37:33.236 --> 37:35.369
To tell the world that you're gay...

37:35.371 --> 37:37.438
to tell yourself...

37:37.440 --> 37:41.075
is not something you
do out of convenience.

37:42.245 --> 37:46.647
It might be the hardest conversation
you ever have.

37:46.649 --> 37:48.515
In not giving us an alibi

37:48.517 --> 37:51.085
he gave us, perhaps, the best alibi

37:51.087 --> 37:53.287
we could ever want.

37:53.289 --> 37:57.758
It's an old-fashioned word
you don't hear so much of anymore,

37:57.760 --> 38:00.561
you don't see so much of anymore.

38:01.898 --> 38:03.964
Character.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.506
(gavel banging)

38:23.719 --> 38:26.086
Would the foreman read the verdict?

38:32.395 --> 38:35.429
FOREMAN: On the charge of
murder in the second degree...

38:37.199 --> 38:39.266
...we find the defendant...

38:39.268 --> 38:41.368
not guilty.

38:41.370 --> 38:43.404
(excited murmurs)

38:43.406 --> 38:45.506
JUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

38:45.508 --> 38:46.707
thank you for your service

38:46.709 --> 38:50.945
and for being an integral
part in the judicial process.

38:50.947 --> 38:52.379
You are dismissed.

38:52.381 --> 38:54.081
(gavel bangs)

39:14.437 --> 39:16.704
Good work, Brandon.

39:37.626 --> 39:38.692
ADELE: Let's go, Taylor.

39:38.694 --> 39:40.327
TAYLOR: Where are we going now?

39:40.329 --> 39:41.695
ADELE: Taylor, let's go.

39:41.697 --> 39:43.564
Meet with your therapist.

39:43.566 --> 39:44.732
TAYLOR: What?

39:44.734 --> 39:47.401
Mom, it's not for an hour.

39:58.314 --> 40:01.849
Excuse me. Bess. Hey.

40:01.851 --> 40:04.451
Oh, I recognize you.

40:04.453 --> 40:06.020
You were always watching us.

40:06.022 --> 40:08.022
(chuckles)

40:08.024 --> 40:09.723
I'm Dr. Jason Bull.

40:09.725 --> 40:11.792
What kind of doctor are you?

40:11.794 --> 40:13.460
Psychologist.

40:14.296 --> 40:17.531
Is that what you do, analyze people?

40:17.533 --> 40:20.401
Not like that. Different.

40:20.403 --> 40:22.903
Well, I was watching you, too.

40:22.905 --> 40:25.205
Oh, yeah?

40:27.410 --> 40:29.443
You grew up with a
lot of pain, didn't you?

40:31.013 --> 40:33.947
That's how you learn how
to watch people like that.

40:33.949 --> 40:36.350
Read 'em.

40:36.352 --> 40:38.719
Figure out what makes 'em go.

40:40.156 --> 40:43.190
To survive in that home. Mm.

40:43.192 --> 40:44.992
I know.

40:44.994 --> 40:46.994
I know.

40:47.863 --> 40:49.029
Can I ask you a question?

40:49.031 --> 40:50.431
Look, can we walk while we talk?

40:50.433 --> 40:51.698
I don't like getting home after dark.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.967
- Why'd you vote not guilty?
- Stop!

40:54.737 --> 40:57.204
Stop trying to figure people out,

40:57.206 --> 40:59.239
just to get 'em to do what you want.

41:01.844 --> 41:03.977
It's just a very lonely place.

41:06.916 --> 41:09.349
I wish I could.

41:11.220 --> 41:14.154
I've never seen so many lost children.

41:16.992 --> 41:19.960
What did we do?

41:22.765 --> 41:25.199
Why do you catch a cold?

41:37.880 --> 41:40.848
ADELE: I just don't know how you
could have been so reckless.

41:40.850 --> 41:42.449
And with Brandon!

41:43.853 --> 41:45.752
These things happen.

41:45.754 --> 41:48.322
