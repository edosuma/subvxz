00:00.001 --> 00:04.269
   Joshua: <i> In the beginning,</i>
    <i> a star fell from heaven</i>

00:04.271 --> 00:06.071
        <i> And changed us.</i>

00:06.073 --> 00:09.274
         <i> Made us angels</i>
   <i> and gave us a new destiny:</i>

00:09.276 --> 00:12.478
     <i> To stop the apocalypse</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:15.447
     <i> And the devil himself.</i>

00:15.449 --> 00:17.249
    <i> We must pass god's test</i>

00:17.251 --> 00:21.387
       <i> And prove humanity</i>
     <i> is still worth saving.</i>

00:21.389 --> 00:23.522
   <i> For we are the messengers.</i>

00:28.195 --> 00:30.029
 <i> Previously on</i> the messengers..

00:30.031 --> 00:33.399
         I can tell you
    where to find your son.

00:33.401 --> 00:36.502
 <i> You just need to finish a job</i>
         <i> for me first.</i>

00:36.504 --> 00:38.437
    I can't kill this woman.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.438
         But you must.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.739
            (gasps)

00:40.741 --> 00:41.807
You're the woman from my vision.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.509
  You thought it was a meteor,

00:43.511 --> 00:45.344
       But that was satan
  being cast down from heaven.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.679
But how are we supposed to stop
       someone like that?

00:47.681 --> 00:50.616
   By using the special gifts
    he has given all of us.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.585
       What did you see?

00:53.587 --> 00:55.821
          Blood. Fire.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.457
Sounds like the horseman of war.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.662
       Vera: <i> Look, i hear</i>
  <i> what you're saying, joshua,</i>

01:03.664 --> 01:05.397
       But how do we know
  you saw the horseman of war?

01:05.399 --> 01:06.398
                      All i know
                  is what i saw.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.367
     <i> A soldier's dog tags,</i>

01:08.369 --> 01:11.236
  <i> A middle eastern guy on fire</i>

01:11.238 --> 01:12.604
    <i> And a statue with a star</i>
          <i> and a sword.</i>

01:12.606 --> 01:15.340
      These visions are messages
              leading us towards

01:15.342 --> 01:16.375
             The first horseman.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.444
I'm all for saving mankind,

01:18.446 --> 01:19.778
But there's something
i got to do.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.480
                          Sorry.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.215
      Family comes first.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.750
      (rap music playing)

01:24.752 --> 01:26.718
   (customers whistle, whoop)

01:30.224 --> 01:32.257
 When are you gonna settle down

01:32.259 --> 01:33.392
 With one of these nice girls,
           eh,<i> mano?</i>

01:33.394 --> 01:35.094
              We all can't be as
            lucky as you, cesar.

01:35.096 --> 01:37.096
                       Gabriela:
              Oh, no, you don't.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.430
       You can't be here.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.365
       Mario doesn't like
        husbands around.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.366
Who do you think we came to see?

01:41.368 --> 01:42.468
      And where is nadia?

01:42.470 --> 01:44.103
       She's with abuela.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.104
             Relax.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.538
    Well, mario's upstairs.

01:50.411 --> 01:51.743
Wait here.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.479
              ¶ ¶

01:57.418 --> 02:00.519
      You can't just stop
      returning my calls.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.421
        Did what we had
      mean nothing to you?

02:02.423 --> 02:03.689
        It's over, raul.

02:03.691 --> 02:04.790
           It's over.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.258
I got to think about nadia now.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.594
        She's my niece.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.662
I want what's best for her, too.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.533
     But i love you, gabby.

02:14.535 --> 02:18.270
      And you love your brother.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.471
         You can't have us both.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.278
Raul! Let's go.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.719
        This stuff good?

02:33.721 --> 02:35.654
           Trust me.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.556
     You'll make a fortune
         on the street.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.665
      It's all there, man.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.666
  What's up? Where's the blow?

02:47.668 --> 02:48.700
Mario:
Yeah.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.402
         About that...

02:50.404 --> 02:51.603
                 Houston police!
               Hands in the air!

02:51.605 --> 02:52.938
What...?
     Let me see your hands!

02:52.940 --> 02:55.207
          Turn around!
You...
What's up, man?

02:55.209 --> 02:56.375
You kidding me? You sold us out?

02:56.377 --> 02:57.442
                     Get off me!
             Are you kidding me?

02:57.444 --> 02:59.411
                 Get down!

02:59.413 --> 03:00.379
    You got the wrong guys!

03:00.381 --> 03:01.513
               Go! Move it!

03:01.515 --> 03:02.915
               Move it, move it!

03:02.916 --> 03:04.316
             Wait!
   Where are you taking them?

03:04.318 --> 03:05.951
Raul!

03:08.923 --> 03:09.922
                   What the hell

03:09.924 --> 03:11.490
       Took you so long?

03:11.492 --> 03:13.258
   My dad could be out there
        dying right now.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.495
That's not gonna happen, nadia.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.433
     I'm gonna go find him.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.712
Raul:
Hey, erin.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.814
    Could you do me a favor?

03:35.816 --> 03:37.482
        Does it involve
       carrying a weapon

03:37.484 --> 03:39.484
   Or interstate kidnapping?

03:39.486 --> 03:40.953
    Can you watch my niece?

03:40.955 --> 03:42.321
     Just for a few hours?

03:42.323 --> 03:44.356
             I'm going with you.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.992
The drug lord who took your dad
  is out there looking for me.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.994
   I'm not gonna put a target
       on your head, too.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.596
                    Look, i want
                        to help,

03:50.598 --> 03:52.464
  But amy needs to get to bed

03:52.466 --> 03:53.599
       And we don't even
     have a place to stay.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.667
          Wouldn't ask
    if it wasn't important.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.236
                    I don't need
                   a babysitter;

03:57.238 --> 03:58.503
                 I can take care
                      of myself.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.505
    It's not safe out there.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.873
   Please, just go with erin.
          I trust her.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.809
              You promise you'll
                     get my dad?

04:03.811 --> 04:05.744
           I promise.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.412
                       Okay.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.880
                  Let's go.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.782
         Where?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.818
         I know a place
      no one will find us.

04:19.692 --> 04:22.261
 Joshua, it's been a pleasure.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.262
                            Hey.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.264
    Why'd you bother coming

04:25.266 --> 04:26.431
 If you were just gonna leave?

04:26.433 --> 04:27.899
Well, let me
break it down for you.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.569
        A few days ago,
    a meteor hit the earth.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.538
    Then, on that same day,

04:32.539 --> 04:34.506
A strange man showed me a video
  of my kidnapped son michael.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.675
        He told me that
   if i came and killed rose,

04:36.677 --> 04:38.777
     I could get him back,
      only now he's gone.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.947
   My son is-is still missing
   and apparently i'm trapped

04:41.949 --> 04:43.715
       In an episode of
      <i> touched by an angel.</i>

04:43.717 --> 04:46.618
      How old was your son
       when he was taken?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.554
      Ten months.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.556
  The boy in the video was...

04:51.558 --> 04:53.558
    Around eight years old,

04:53.560 --> 04:56.728
  Which would be the exact age
       of michael today.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.530
   A lot of time has passed.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.115
     How could you be sure

05:00.116 --> 05:01.699
   That the boy in the video
     is actually your son?

05:01.702 --> 05:04.469
    Because i'm his mother,
          that's how.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.570
                  You're right.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.739
              Hey, you're right.
                      I'm sorry.

05:07.741 --> 05:11.076
        It's just that rose said
     not to stray from the path.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.611
                         Vera...

05:12.613 --> 05:14.913
                    We need you.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.028
       She's on the move.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.096
      Should i follow her?

05:33.400 --> 05:34.633
     (truck engine starts)

05:34.635 --> 05:35.867
           Copy that.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.948
    (dog barks in distance)

05:49.950 --> 05:51.550
          (erin sighs)

05:51.552 --> 05:54.619
   There's an eviction notice
          on the door.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.421
Are you sure this place is safe?

05:56.423 --> 05:57.422
                          Nadia:
                       Trust me.

05:57.424 --> 05:59.124
My dad flips foreclosed houses.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.027
   This one's been abandoned
          for months.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.929
                  Okay, come on.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.430
                     Here we go.

06:05.432 --> 06:07.699
                    There we go.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.503
         It's actually
      pretty cozy in here.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.442
So you party with
your friends here a lot?

06:17.444 --> 06:18.677
                           Yeah.

06:18.679 --> 06:22.414
    There's no electricity,
     but plenty of candles.

06:22.416 --> 06:25.050
                      Bathroom's
                  down the hall.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.051
                           So...

06:26.053 --> 06:27.886
What are you, raul's girlfriend?

06:27.888 --> 06:30.422
      Me? No.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.490
         No.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.060
 Then what are you doing here?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.832
       It's complicated.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.114
              ¶ ¶

07:26.713 --> 07:28.780
            (laughs)

07:33.120 --> 07:35.187
       (knocking at door)

07:40.794 --> 07:42.894
       Should i come back
with champagne and strawberries?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.729
 Alan, what are you doing here?

07:44.731 --> 07:46.765
     I triangulated the gps
         on your phone.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.300
        Seriously?

07:48.301 --> 07:49.834
       No, i just always
      wanted to say that.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.837
                    You used the
                   company card.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.072
       Mind if i come in?

07:54.074 --> 07:56.541
      Uh...

07:56.543 --> 07:57.542
             Sure.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.010
And also, do you mind telling me

07:59.012 --> 08:01.913
         What the hell
    you're doing in houston?

08:01.915 --> 08:02.914
It doesn't matter now.

08:02.916 --> 08:03.982
                     No, i think
                 it does matter.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.183
                 I just drove 14
              hours to get here.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.251
No, it doesn't, okay?

08:06.253 --> 08:07.886
  It's been a really long day,

08:07.888 --> 08:09.988
   And i'm tired and we have
  a long drive back tomorrow.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.890
          We're not leaving yet.
We have an appointment tomorrow.

08:11.892 --> 08:12.924
       For what?

08:12.926 --> 08:14.659
                     For this.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.829
   Look, the military covered up
      a giant hole in the earth,

08:17.831 --> 08:19.197
              Made it disappear.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.565
                And i think this
              piece of meteorite

08:20.567 --> 08:23.101
                   Has something
                  to do with it.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.903
        So, i called the world's
                 foremost expert

08:24.905 --> 08:27.272
           In planetary geology,
             who happens to have

08:27.274 --> 08:29.641
          A state-of-the-art lab
          right here in houston.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.676
    You called leo travers,
          didn't you?

08:31.678 --> 08:33.044
      Yeah. You know him?

08:33.046 --> 08:35.914
  I'm familiar with his work.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.048
 What time is the appointment?

08:37.049 --> 08:38.250
                    Noon.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.284
Okay.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.986
       I'll see you then.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.028
              ¶ ¶

09:16.957 --> 09:18.990
    You've got some cojones,

09:18.992 --> 09:20.692
       Asking me to come
     all the way out here.

09:20.694 --> 09:21.793
I'm getting tired

09:21.795 --> 09:23.695
  Of you dea sons of bitches.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.231
               Oh, i'm sorry you
         feel that way, el jefe.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.899
  I sent two men to kill raul.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.801
   Now those men are dead...

09:29.803 --> 09:31.169
  And guess who's still alive?

09:31.171 --> 09:33.238
                 I can fix that.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.706
                 You have cesar?

09:34.708 --> 09:35.607
           Yes.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.075
         Bring him here tonight.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.777
      Why would i do that?

09:38.779 --> 09:41.680
           'cause i'll make sure
         raul comes to find him.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.649
              Then you can enjoy
         watching them both die.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.126
            Joshua:
      What about sanskrit?

09:55.128 --> 09:56.795
Rose:
Mm-hmm.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.130
    How about hieroglyphics?

09:59.132 --> 10:00.231
Yes.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.700
         Computer code?

10:01.702 --> 10:04.302
I haven't tried that one yet,
but probably.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.671
        So, you understand every
          language in the world?

10:06.673 --> 10:09.874
I understand what god tells me.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.876
            How come you get the
         cool gift and i'm stuck

10:11.878 --> 10:15.714
           Making sense of these
            whacked-out visions?

10:15.716 --> 10:17.215
<i>Treystio guoi.</i>

10:17.217 --> 10:19.250
              Care to translate?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.118
Icelandic.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.220
It means "trust in god."

10:25.859 --> 10:28.059
          Is this the statue you
             saw in your vision?

10:28.061 --> 10:29.694
Yeah, that's it.

10:29.696 --> 10:30.762
     How did you find that?

10:30.764 --> 10:31.830
                    Doesn't take
                    a detective.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.164
   I just googled "statue woman,

10:33.166 --> 10:35.634
              Sword and a star."

10:35.636 --> 10:36.668
              That's the goddess
              of liberty statue

10:36.670 --> 10:38.203
     In the texas state capitol.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.271
        Think that means
   the horseman's in austin?

10:40.273 --> 10:41.706
Maybe.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.942
But we still need
to find out who it is.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.076
     And whatever terrible thing

10:45.078 --> 10:46.911
             They're about to do
            to break their seal.

10:46.913 --> 10:50.215
   You want me to google "middle
           eastern man on fire"?

11:04.698 --> 11:06.331
 Your yard looks good, clarke.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.366
                     Raul?

11:10.737 --> 11:13.438
We've been watching you
for a while, raul.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.174
That's your boss, el jefe.
You work for his cartel.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.843
      No way, man. I'm not
messed up in anything like that.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.946
You are! You're just too far
down the food chain to know it.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.449
But what if i told you we were
gonna let you walk out of here?

11:24.451 --> 11:26.017
No charges, no jail.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.753
       What's the catch?

11:28.755 --> 11:30.288
      We're gonna turn you
     into a federal agent.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.724
              No.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.025
          No way, man.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.326
          I'm no rat.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.963
Maybe not.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.366
But you got potential.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.901
     I mean, for one thing,

11:42.903 --> 11:44.836
 You're a hell of a lot smarter
       than your brother.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.471
That little back-room buy
at the strip club?

11:46.473 --> 11:47.972
That was his third strike.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.742
He's gonna spend the rest
of his life in prison.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.078
Work with us, we'll wipe
both your records clean.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.312
Everybody wins.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.319
       I should've known
  it was you that sold me out.

12:01.321 --> 12:05.290
Now tell me where my brother is,
  and maybe i don't kill you.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.325
 I swear i don't know anything.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.994
You went to el jefe.

12:09.996 --> 12:13.231
You told him i was dea.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.900
And then you sent
two agents to ice me.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.769
                   No, i didn't.

12:17.771 --> 12:20.772
     Clarke: <i> Until el jefe</i>
       <i> paid me 300 grand.</i>

12:20.774 --> 12:22.273
            300 g's?

12:22.275 --> 12:24.109
            Come on.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.844
 I'm worth at least half a mil.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.081
  Yeah, i just read your mind.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.449
        (clock chiming)

12:37.290 --> 12:39.357
I really enjoyed
our little chat.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.359
But now it's time for you to go.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.332
    Do you guys smell smoke?

12:47.334 --> 12:49.267
     We're making s'mores.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.502
           For lunch?

12:50.504 --> 12:52.403
She's the best babysitter ever!

12:52.405 --> 12:54.539
             I hope that's okay.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.441
           Well, it's not ideal,
                 but then again,

12:56.442 --> 12:58.342
               Neither is living
          in a foreclosed house.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.345
          Did you find
   the man on fire yet, mom?

13:00.347 --> 13:02.046
           No, not yet, sweetie.

13:02.048 --> 13:05.316
 Nadia, would you mind watching
   her for a few more hours?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.352
    Got to go check out some
  more books from the library.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.787
             Sure.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.054
            Gives us time to get

13:10.056 --> 13:11.089
       Ice cream sundaes.
Yeah!

13:15.195 --> 13:17.829
                     Oh, my god!

13:20.433 --> 13:22.200
Mom! What are you doing?

13:24.971 --> 13:27.071
           It's him.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.876
  Hey! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.211
           Slow down.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.979
    What are you telling me?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.315
   The man from your vision?
       The one in flames?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.517
 I think i may know who he is.

13:45.559 --> 13:47.058
 So, you say you know this guy?

13:47.060 --> 13:48.493
Yeah, we went
to grad school together.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.229
                  Oh, you didn't
            mention that before.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.197
I didn't?
                     No.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.498
       Oh.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.933
I mean, he's
a planetary geologist,

13:54.935 --> 13:56.901
I'm a radio astronomer.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.304
You know, it's a small universe.
Our paths crossed.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.471
                     Oh, my god!
       What?

14:00.473 --> 14:02.207
                  You dated him.
What are you talking about?

14:02.209 --> 14:03.308
        What am i talking about?

14:03.310 --> 14:04.342
                   Oh, v, you're
              holding out on me.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.376
      Why you holding out on me?
Listen.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.477
It's ancient history, all right?

14:06.479 --> 14:07.912
    And the guy was a jerk.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.247
 I don't want to be here longer
        than we have to.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.281
          So, drop it.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.382
             Okay.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.252
          "planetary geologist."

14:14.254 --> 14:16.988
         Did he rock your world?

14:16.990 --> 14:18.423
     Oh, you have no idea.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.595
                 Uh, you haven't
              touched your wine.

14:23.597 --> 14:25.129
      Are you, uh, feeling okay?

14:25.131 --> 14:26.197
Oh.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.900
      Yeah, uh, i feel...

14:28.902 --> 14:31.569
        Great actually.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.905
                      Vera, i...
Leo...

14:35.242 --> 14:37.542
           You first.

14:40.614 --> 14:42.881
          These last six months?

14:44.918 --> 14:46.384
     They've been truly amazing.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.022
               You're one of the
            most beautiful women

14:51.024 --> 14:52.190
                  I've ever met.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.391
                        (laughs)

14:53.393 --> 14:55.627
    Not to mention the smartest.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.365
          You're really special.

15:02.102 --> 15:05.436
                  And that's why
                  i feel like...

15:07.941 --> 15:11.242
              ...I can't do this
                 to you anymore.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.314
          I've met someone else.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.488
                   It's not fair
                 to lead you on.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.925
                   I didn't know
                how to tell you.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.260
         I am so sorry.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.395
            (laughs)

15:30.397 --> 15:33.131
         You're sorry?

15:33.133 --> 15:34.399
          (whispers):
         You're sorry.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.438
         You should go.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.591
                           Vera?

16:00.593 --> 16:02.293
              Oh.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.396
  Uh, dr. Harris here told me
  he was bringing a colleague.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.399
        But i... Didn't
      expect it to be you.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.401
                       Surprise.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.337
                           Alan:
              Professor travers,

16:12.339 --> 16:13.638
We really appreciate you
meeting with us.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.672
    Uh, call me leo, please.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.407
      And i'm always happy

16:16.409 --> 16:17.642
     To help an old friend.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.211
Well...

16:20.213 --> 16:21.546
       Let's take a look
     at this rock of yours,

16:21.548 --> 16:23.081
Shall we?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.263
       How long you been
      working for el jefe?

16:39.265 --> 16:41.299
I'm asking the questions here.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.568
    Clarke: <i> Selling you out</i>
        <i> is my ticket in.</i>

16:43.570 --> 16:45.336
            (laughs)

16:45.338 --> 16:46.771
          Yeah, yeah.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.439
    I knew you sold me out.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.308
          <i> How the hell</i>
      <i> is he reading my...?</i>

17:04.691 --> 17:05.623
      Where's my brother?

17:05.625 --> 17:06.656
         I don't know!

17:06.659 --> 17:08.291
        Don't lie to me!

17:08.294 --> 17:09.527
  <i> Oh, god! He's gonna kill me</i>

17:09.529 --> 17:12.030
         <i> Over something</i>
       <i> i don't even know.</i>

17:12.031 --> 17:14.332
           (grunting)

17:14.334 --> 17:16.200
You know i'm not gonna kill you.

17:16.202 --> 17:20.171
       But you listen carefully,
     you crooked son of a bitch.

17:20.173 --> 17:23.307
  I'm sure the dea would love
  to know you're on the take.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.510
    So you're gonna help me
      get my name cleared.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.479
And if you so much as even think
    about crossing me again

17:28.481 --> 17:31.449
        With el jefe...

17:31.451 --> 17:34.285
           I'll know.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.422
      (cell phone ringing)

17:42.762 --> 17:44.462
             Erin:
           Hey, raul.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.465
        I can't believe
 i'm about to say this, but...

17:47.467 --> 17:49.667
     We may have just found
      the first horseman.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.636
     He's visiting a mosque
        here in houston.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.238
       So, i don't know,
  maybe you could come and...

17:54.240 --> 17:56.741
Read his thoughts or something?

18:00.780 --> 18:03.614
   I'm kind of in the middle
    of something right now.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.524
        He's not coming.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.462
     So, what do we do now?

18:17.464 --> 18:19.797
             We say our prayers.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.866
                        Come on.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.782
Easy, raul.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.518
   You sure you want to kill
     another federal agent?

18:43.323 --> 18:45.289
Besides...

18:45.291 --> 18:47.425
      I know where el jefe
       has your brother.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.628
    It's not what you think.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.196
      Of course it isn't.

18:52.198 --> 18:55.366
    We know all about clarke
     and how he set you up.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.336
El jefe got some
of our agents in his pocket.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.905
     We're going after him.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.641
  Tell me where my brother is.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.177
     Come on, agent garcia.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.645
    You know how this works.

19:07.647 --> 19:11.182
       I need something,
    and you need something.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.451
 Tell me everything about this
 new group you're working with.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.253
        What new group?

19:15.255 --> 19:16.587
You know.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.257
     Your drinking buddies
         from the bar.

19:19.259 --> 19:22.527
  I want to know their names,
   how you met, your mission.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.562
         Their mission?

19:24.564 --> 19:27.565
      No, they got nothing
      to do with el jefe.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.568
  Oh, so you don't want to see
      your brother again.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.703
          No, no, i...

19:32.705 --> 19:34.539
             I do.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.407
So tell me
what i want to know.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.845
I want to know every damn thing
they're doing.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.214
But they really can't help you.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.550
    Well...

19:45.552 --> 19:47.618
I'll be the judge of that.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.860
         (man chanting)

19:55.862 --> 19:57.929
        (speaks arabic)

19:59.766 --> 20:02.767
Look, it's the prime minister
from joshua's vision.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.303
         How do we figure out if
        he's the first horseman?

20:05.305 --> 20:06.737
Just follow my lead.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.674
(speaking arabic)

20:13.813 --> 20:15.780
        What's going on?

20:15.782 --> 20:17.615
      Sounds like he said
        many will curse

20:17.617 --> 20:19.550
 The prime minister's actions.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.522
  And that god is on his side.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.824
Do you think he's the horseman?

20:30.830 --> 20:32.897
 (crowd clamoring, siren wails)

20:39.706 --> 20:42.240
This is why
we need raul.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.823
                     We may need
                 more than that.

21:02.729 --> 21:03.995
  This doesn't make any sense.

21:03.997 --> 21:06.764
Why would the government
cover up a meteor site?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.766
      Look, i know this is
        hard to believe,

21:08.768 --> 21:10.901
     But i'm telling you--
         we were there.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.570
    This rock, it's special.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.572
            Must be.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.008
     Got you to come to me
     after all these years.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.876
          I wish i had a choice.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.946
      So can you help us?

21:21.948 --> 21:23.014
You'll have to calibrate
the mass spectrometer

21:23.016 --> 21:24.449
If you want to run
this sample.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.883
   I trust you know your way
    around a processing lab.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.051
                           Alan:
                        Sure do.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.787
       I'll leave you two
      to get reacquainted.

21:33.026 --> 21:35.793
  It's really good to see you.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.629
           What happened to you?

21:40.066 --> 21:42.300
     Huntington's disease.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.037
 I was never much of a dancer.

21:46.039 --> 21:48.306
              Leo, i'm so sorry.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.809
          When did you find out?

21:51.811 --> 21:56.380
(sighs) i was diagnosed
nine years ago.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.818
                           Wait.

22:00.820 --> 22:04.822
                      That's why
                    you left me?

22:04.824 --> 22:07.958
     My grandfather had it.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.594
    But no one suffered more
      than my grandmother.

22:12.665 --> 22:16.801
       For over 20 years,
     she was his caretaker.

22:16.803 --> 22:19.103
   And it wasn't fair to her.

22:21.074 --> 22:24.909
And it wouldn't have been
fair to you.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.845
And worse, it's...

22:27.847 --> 22:30.014
It's hereditary.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.917
And i know how badly
you wanted to have children.

22:34.754 --> 22:37.688
        I couldn't risk
     passing it on to them.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.890
              So there was never
                    anyone else.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.932
 Tell me i did the right thing.

22:47.934 --> 22:51.001
 You're... You're happy, right?

22:51.003 --> 22:54.839
You have a family
of your own now?

22:54.841 --> 22:57.908
        Everything's been great.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.013
             Yeah.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.816
     Now, you go over here.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.753
         And let's see
      what you're made of.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.905
         There's still
      two other visions--

23:27.907 --> 23:29.673
    Some soldier's dog tags
      and a bloody goblet.

23:29.675 --> 23:30.975
                   Well, the dog
               tags could belong

23:30.977 --> 23:32.543
                To the one-armed
                vet, ben fulsom.

23:32.545 --> 23:33.944
We know he's linked
to the senator.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.713
Could he be connected
to the prime minister, too?

23:35.715 --> 23:36.847
                 The only way we
             could've known that

23:36.849 --> 23:38.682
               Was if he'd lived
              long enough for us

23:38.684 --> 23:41.018
                 To talk to him.
   Well, i can tell you this.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.853
      Ben fulsom's funeral
        is later today.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.024
 You're not gonna believe this.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.092
       Here, take a look.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.962
        N-no, there must
        be some mistake.

23:51.964 --> 23:52.997
You're gonna
run it again.

23:52.999 --> 23:53.998
                       I did.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.065
                    Three times.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.934
These results are
accurate.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.602
        You mean to tell me that
            this rock has traces

23:58.604 --> 24:00.004
                Of every element
             known to man in it?

24:00.006 --> 24:01.038
Yep, plus one more.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.874
             Vera:
   Element of unknown origin?

24:03.876 --> 24:06.010
                    What?
I told you
this rock was special.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.945
Show it to me again.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.782
             Wait.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.917
            How...?

24:12.919 --> 24:14.084
               Where's the rock?

24:14.086 --> 24:15.453
I left it right here.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.121
                 Okay, well, who
               else was in here?

24:17.123 --> 24:18.489
         I don't know
    who else was in here.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.491
                Seriously, alan?

24:24.464 --> 24:25.796
               Excuse me.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.231
                       Hey! Hey!

24:27.233 --> 24:28.466
             Wait!

24:28.468 --> 24:30.634
                           Stop!

24:30.636 --> 24:32.503
                      Hey! Stop!

24:32.505 --> 24:35.039
                       Wait, no!

24:41.113 --> 24:42.847
         What the hell?

24:42.849 --> 24:44.482
         (door closes)

24:50.256 --> 24:52.790
(van door closes, engine starts,
         tires screech)

24:52.792 --> 24:54.592
           Hey! Hey!

24:54.594 --> 24:55.659
           Hey, stop!

25:24.790 --> 25:27.024
Stay with me.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.058
            You can't die, vera.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.093
She's not breathing.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.128
Come on, vera.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.096
             Alan.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.998
Alan, i'm right here.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.535
Leo.

25:50.049 --> 25:53.050
           (gasping)

25:53.052 --> 25:55.920
                      Thank god.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.122
What the hell is happening
to you, vera?

26:09.769 --> 26:12.136
        I must have just
      gotten knocked out.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.671
                           Alan:
                             No.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.674
      No, you stopped breathing.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.309
               That's the second
                 time this week.

26:18.311 --> 26:19.643
          Second time?

26:19.645 --> 26:21.178
Vera, you need to see a doctor.

26:21.180 --> 26:24.582
Thank you both for your concern,
      but i'm fine, okay?

26:25.751 --> 26:27.885
          I got to go.

26:29.655 --> 26:30.888
      Where are you going?

26:32.358 --> 26:34.825
 Has she always been like this?

26:36.796 --> 26:38.929
  I think she's gotten worse.

26:38.931 --> 26:42.666
              Man:
 "and i will dwell in the house
  of the lord forever. Amen."

26:42.668 --> 26:45.302
All: Amen.
      Yeah, that's the guy i saw
   in the senator's campaign ad.

26:45.304 --> 26:48.672
  Joshua: Everyone in this state
           loves cindy richards.

26:48.674 --> 26:50.941
Especially veterans.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.276
        Good afternoon.

26:52.278 --> 26:56.814
           My name is
    senator cindy richards.

26:56.816 --> 27:00.284
     Major benjamin fulsom
         was a patriot

27:00.286 --> 27:03.621
Who served alongside my own son
        in afghanistan.

27:03.623 --> 27:06.056
Their unit worked hard

27:06.058 --> 27:08.892
    To rebuild afghanistan's
        infrastructure.

27:08.894 --> 27:11.261
And in their memory,

27:11.263 --> 27:12.796
    I'll continue that work

27:12.798 --> 27:14.298
         With the help
  of the afghan prime minister

27:14.300 --> 27:17.334
At tomorrow's energy summit
in austin.

27:20.906 --> 27:23.374
These belonged
to my own son.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.376
   And i promise to make sure

27:25.378 --> 27:28.879
   That these brave soldiers'
 sacrifice will not be in vain.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.214
                         Joshua:
                   The dog tags.

27:30.216 --> 27:33.250
  You don't think she could be
      the first horseman?

27:33.252 --> 27:34.785
         It's possible.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.387
      But it could also be
     prime minister nazari.

27:36.389 --> 27:38.389
             We need to be sure.

27:38.391 --> 27:39.923
   I'm gonna go talk to her.
     Wait.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.825
           Even if you could get
           through her security,

27:41.827 --> 27:43.694
What would you say?

27:43.696 --> 27:45.696
That you're an angel
of the apocalypse,

27:45.698 --> 27:47.297
And you think
she's the horseman of war?

28:01.781 --> 28:03.781
                      We'll find
                    another way.

28:10.756 --> 28:13.123
      (man speaks spanish)

28:18.364 --> 28:20.898
             Cesar.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.866
        (steady beeping)

28:22.868 --> 28:24.268
                          Cesar?

28:29.842 --> 28:31.875
            (groans)

28:31.877 --> 28:33.210
    Raul, you can't be here.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.079
                  You got to go.
Oh, god.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.247
  There's a remote detonator.

28:37.249 --> 28:38.382
         Where's nadia?

28:38.384 --> 28:39.950
She's safe.

28:40.820 --> 28:41.952
              Hey.

28:43.089 --> 28:45.889
   I'm not gonna let you die.

28:49.995 --> 28:52.963
Is he there?

28:57.002 --> 28:59.336
       I need you to look
      after nadia for me.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.871
       Tell her that i love her.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.940
   You can tell her yourself.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.374
       Raul, look at me.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.977
    We've got a lot of water
  under the bridge between us.

29:06.979 --> 29:10.214
I know you took the fall for me,
and i forgive you for gabriela.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.049
                  But you got to
                get out of here.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.851
      You got to take care
       of my little girl.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.252
              No.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.454
          Teach nadia
     to be better than us.

29:18.791 --> 29:20.524
    I'm not gonna leave you!

29:20.526 --> 29:22.826
     Raul, if we both die,
      she'll have no one.

29:22.828 --> 29:25.229
                             Go.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.431
              Now!

29:28.768 --> 29:29.933
              Go!

29:31.036 --> 29:32.770
       <i> Sangre por sangre.</i>

29:33.339 --> 29:34.938
           (beeping)

29:34.940 --> 29:36.273
      (footsteps running)

30:02.134 --> 30:04.201
              ¶ ¶

30:31.230 --> 30:33.297
              ¶ ¶

30:55.221 --> 30:57.287
   (heavy metal song playing)

31:21.146 --> 31:23.180
          What the...

31:53.279 --> 31:55.045
Nice work.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.346
                 Thank you, sir.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.587
File this with the others.

32:23.075 --> 32:26.176
      If you ask me, we're about
        to kick a hornet's nest.

32:26.178 --> 32:27.277
He's right.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.712
We can't screw this up.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.447
   There's too much at stake
         for all of us.

32:30.449 --> 32:34.184
   I think the prime minister
   is about to commit a sin.

32:34.186 --> 32:37.154
       The imam said even
his own people would curse him.

32:37.156 --> 32:40.023
   The visions clearly point
      to senator richards.

32:40.025 --> 32:41.091
       I think it's her.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.460
     What if it's neither?

32:45.597 --> 32:47.531
        I saw the devil
     with the both of them.

32:49.034 --> 32:50.067
    Why didn't you tell us?

32:50.069 --> 32:51.234
                   I didn't want
                  to believe it,

32:51.236 --> 32:53.103
  But i saw him shaking hands

32:53.105 --> 32:55.272
   With both senator richards
   and prime minister nazari.

32:55.274 --> 32:56.606
  How can it be both of them?

32:56.608 --> 32:58.825
           It can't.

32:58.826 --> 33:01.043
  The devil must be trying to
figure it out, just like we are.

33:01.046 --> 33:02.679
        Wouldn't he know
     who the horsemen are?

33:02.681 --> 33:05.015
           Maybe not.

33:05.017 --> 33:07.217
 So you're saying we're in some
  kind of race with the devil?

33:07.219 --> 33:08.719
      The energy summit's
        tomorrow night.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.154
     The prime minister and
the senator will both be there.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.524
        Then so will we.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.062
             Alan:
     All right, we're here.

33:19.064 --> 33:22.132
                 Now, who are we
                  meeting again?

33:22.134 --> 33:24.768
       Not, uh, we, alan.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.136
Just me.

33:26.138 --> 33:27.571
   Are you serious right now?

33:27.573 --> 33:30.007
         You can't keep
     shutting me out, vera.

33:30.009 --> 33:31.074
        I came to help.

33:31.076 --> 33:32.409
   And you are helping, okay?

33:32.411 --> 33:34.311
  We still need to figure out
      who stole that rock.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.482
I just need you to trust me
right now, please?

33:44.390 --> 33:45.589
      I'll call you later.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.090
           I promise.

33:50.796 --> 33:53.230
       Why do i always go
      for the crazy ones?

33:55.134 --> 33:57.234
Rose: Wow, from the look
on your face, i'm guessing

33:57.236 --> 33:59.302
  You finally found your gift.

33:59.304 --> 34:01.304
 You couldn't have just told me
      what it was earlier?

34:01.306 --> 34:03.273
              No.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.708
     You needed to discover
       how to spirit walk

34:04.710 --> 34:06.777
On your own.

34:08.213 --> 34:11.313
    It's not the only thing
         i discovered.

34:11.315 --> 34:13.216
                I know you think
                 it's the devil.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.318
I don't really know what it is,

34:15.320 --> 34:18.188
   But somehow that meteorite
  is connected to all of this.

34:18.190 --> 34:19.589
                   And i'm gonna
                   find out how.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.828
             Raul?

34:24.830 --> 34:26.530
What happened?

34:30.302 --> 34:33.370
        It-it's my fault
    that my brother's dead.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.239
      Raul, i'm so sorry.

34:37.242 --> 34:40.277
      El jefe took cesar,
         and the devil

34:40.279 --> 34:41.478
          Made sure i showed up.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.346
   The devil, he came to you?

34:43.348 --> 34:45.782
     I betrayed you, rose.

34:47.386 --> 34:50.420
      I betrayed everyone.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.721
     I told him a-about us.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.690
           I told him
    about joshua's visions.

34:53.692 --> 34:56.159
           I told him everything
               he wanted to know

34:56.161 --> 34:58.562
       About our mission to stop
                 the apocalypse.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.530
                I failed us all.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.499
      No, it's all right.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.568
     He gave you no choice.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.505
          What matters
  is that we're together now.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.345
          (door opens)

35:20.252 --> 35:21.351
Get away!

35:21.353 --> 35:22.686
              No!

35:22.688 --> 35:25.222
                             No!

35:25.224 --> 35:27.224
                       (sobbing)

35:27.226 --> 35:28.291
                             No.

35:28.293 --> 35:31.495
              No!

35:48.780 --> 35:54.451
Woman:
¶ amazing grace ¶

35:54.453 --> 36:03.260
¶ how sweet the sound ¶

36:03.262 --> 36:08.265

36:08.267 --> 36:12.502

36:12.504 --> 36:19.376

36:35.294 --> 36:37.260

36:41.900 --> 36:46.403
           ¶ i see. ¶

36:46.405 --> 36:48.338
        (sirens wailing)

36:48.340 --> 36:50.307
                    Peter moore,

36:50.309 --> 36:51.408
You're under arrest

36:51.410 --> 36:53.743
                  For the murder
                  of sam murphy.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.979
You have the right
to remain silent.

36:55.981 --> 36:58.348
        Anything you say can and
        will be used against you

36:58.350 --> 36:59.583
              In a court of law.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.651
(indistinct radio transmissions)

37:03.388 --> 37:05.689
        (siren chirping)

37:05.691 --> 37:07.757
            Officer:
        Watch your head.
