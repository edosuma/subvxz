WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.200
.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.280
Watch out, Newcastle. We are back!

00:11.360 --> 00:14.560
(all cheering)
We're gonna go fucking acka.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.680
It's time to smash Newcastle.
We're on the pull!

00:17.760 --> 00:19.760
Things are gonna go pure radge.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.040
What the fuck?

00:23.120 --> 00:24.560
(screams)
(shouting)

00:24.640 --> 00:26.080
Calm the fuck down!

00:26.160 --> 00:29.040
This time, there's gonna be
more necking on.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.680
Whoo!
More kick-offs.

00:32.760 --> 00:34.840
(screams)
More drama.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.920
Slag! More tears, more tantrums.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
More loving, more shagging,
more drunk-ness.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.760
Howay, Chloe, man.
And more falling over!

00:44.840 --> 00:47.160
Sounds fucking mint!

00:47.240 --> 00:50.680
Watch out, Newcastle,
cos the Geordie squad

00:50.760 --> 00:52.520
are back in the fucking mix.

00:53.680 --> 00:57.000
Let's get this fucking party
started. Let the games begin.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.040
You are a fucking liar!

00:59.120 --> 01:03.080
Newcastle! Oi, oi!
It's time to tear up the toon.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.160
(all scream)

01:09.000 --> 01:11.600
Oi, oi.
What the fuck? There's a new boy!

01:11.680 --> 01:13.840
He looks like
a skinny Justin Bieber.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.760
You happy to see us?
Yeah. Me and Martin have shagged.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.240
It's a big'un.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.040
(cheering)It's time
to show Marty how we party.

01:24.280 --> 01:27.880
Marty's braver than he looks.
He's cracking on with Chantelle.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.120
Time to part-ay!
(all cheer)

01:30.200 --> 01:33.120
Charlotte, what are you doing?
If you were ever single,

01:33.200 --> 01:35.240
I would never neck on
with anyone else.

01:35.320 --> 01:39.240
There'll always be something between
me and Charlotte. I can't deny that.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.080
Do you wanna be single
and go on the pull? You what?

01:43.400 --> 01:46.240
No lad gets to treat me like a mug
and gets away with it.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.680
Fuck you.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.360
I cannot believe the kid
has just grassed me up.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.080
Yeah, have some of that,
you fucking little mug.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.600
Marty's literally just gone
for Scott. That is not happening.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.080
Marty, you little divvy.
You've just got here

01:59.160 --> 02:02.200
and you've already fucked
us lads over. Bad fucking move.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.560
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.280
I would never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.920
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.160
Get me in this house,
I'm gonna tear it up.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.560
I wrap the lads
round my little finger.

02:15.640 --> 02:19.440
I'm preened to perfection.
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.840
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.960
My banter's pure naughty.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.320
I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.400
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:44.240 --> 02:46.160
Did you have a good night, everyone?

02:46.240 --> 02:47.440
(all) Yeah.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.360
I pulled!
Oh, my God, you did.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.520
# Ahhhh #

02:50.600 --> 02:53.640
I was the only one
who pulled last night.

02:53.720 --> 02:56.120
I feel like an absolute god

02:56.200 --> 02:58.480
and the rest of them
should all bow down to me

02:58.560 --> 03:00.360
for the rest of their lives.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.960
I think I might've told Aaron
something. What?

03:05.840 --> 03:09.280
I was absolutely mortal last night
and I did some crazy shit

03:09.360 --> 03:12.640
but telling Aaron that I loved him,
that topped the lot.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.600
I'm absolutely fuming with Scott.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.880
He said to Martin if I didn't sleep
with him last night,

03:17.960 --> 03:20.520
he was gonna fuck me off today
and go on the pull.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.280
I'm gutted. After everything
we've been through,

03:23.360 --> 03:26.120
he was only after a shag.
I liked him but what a wanker.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.080
What a cheeky bastard.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.520
I've just arrived in the house

03:33.600 --> 03:36.120
and I already feel like I fucked us
with the boys

03:36.200 --> 03:39.560
but at the end of the day, I'm a
single lad and I do fancy Chantelle

03:39.640 --> 03:41.960
so the door is wide open now
for me to crack on.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.880
(chuckles)

03:46.960 --> 03:50.360
The whole duvet's soaked. I'm wet!

03:50.440 --> 03:52.560
I'm hanging to fuck,
I've been pranked

03:52.640 --> 03:55.120
and to top it off, I pissed the bed.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.280
I spent ages grafting Chantelle.
Last night she didn't even give us

04:04.360 --> 04:07.360
a fucking chance to explain myself.
We are fucking done.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.480
Last night, new boy Marty
caused some serious shit.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.840
If he carries on like this,
none of the lads'll like him.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.360
It's not just the house
that's a state. We're all in bits.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.160
After the kick-offs last night,

04:35.240 --> 04:37.400
everyone needs
to chill the fuck out.

04:43.080 --> 04:48.320
This is an absolute mess. Fuck. It's
Anna. She looks in her crystal ball

04:48.400 --> 04:52.320
and she knows exactly what's going
on. She's actually quite clever.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.680
I cannot believe yous have had
a party without my permission.

04:55.760 --> 04:59.080
Gaz, Marty. Fighting? It's not on.

04:59.160 --> 05:02.080
It was more of a wrestle than a fight
but Anna's right.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.800
We shouldn't let arguments
turn physical.

05:04.880 --> 05:08.960
It's an absolute, complete shit-tip.
Sort it.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.920
Cheers, Anna. It's always a pleasure
when you stop by.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.640
Now off you pop, you dick.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.280
I can't get out of bed.
This is so hard.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.400
Last night I thought I was gonna
get to see Kyle at the party

05:22.480 --> 05:24.280
but the lads didn't want him here.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.480
Fucking feathers everywhere.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.320
It's like a shitload of chickens
have had an orgy.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.160
This is gonna take hours, like.
I brush, you bag.

05:34.240 --> 05:37.840
We should fucking go out.
Let them tidy the fucking house.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.960
Fuck this cleaning.
We need to get out.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.640
Let's just get a football
and go for a kick-about.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.280
The new lad's not invited
to football.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.920
That kid has got a lot to learn
about lad code,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.960
especially living in this house.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.800
Where are yous going?
For a kick-about, our room's tidy.

05:57.880 --> 06:00.760
Is it?I know Marty's the new kid
but he cannot go around

06:00.840 --> 06:03.320
grassing up the lads
to try and graft the girls.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.040
It does not work like that.
Fucking nae chance.

06:06.120 --> 06:09.680
I'll look after Chantelle for you,
Scott. Crack on, mate. I will do.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.680
The lads are obviously
still pissed off off last night.

06:12.760 --> 06:16.280
They haven't invited us to football
but I want Chantelle on our side

06:16.360 --> 06:17.360
cos I do fancy her.

06:22.520 --> 06:25.920
I tell you what. A kick-about is
the best thing to sort a hangover.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.240
Nathan, get your big ass in goal,
kid.(chuckling)

06:29.320 --> 06:31.320
Go on.
Oh!

06:31.400 --> 06:34.640
The boys put us in goal. The only
balls that I know how to handle

06:34.720 --> 06:36.240
are attached to a male body.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.560
Ugh.
(laughs)

06:37.640 --> 06:39.920
(chuckling)

06:40.000 --> 06:43.880
Mate, last night. Marnie, fucking
hell. Dropping the L-bomb on us.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.040
I'm talking to Gaz
and I'm still in shock

06:46.120 --> 06:48.520
about Marnie dropping the L-bomb
last night.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.120
Marnie did catch me off-guard
but I am happy that she did say it.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.480
To yous I was going,
"Course I'm gonna pull"

06:54.560 --> 06:57.040
and to her I was like,
"I didn't wanna pull."

06:57.120 --> 07:00.280
This time you know I said,
"I'm gonna crack on with Marnie."

07:00.360 --> 07:04.040
Aaron's taking this way more calmly
than I expected.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.800
What was it like fucking
seeing Charlotte neck on?

07:06.880 --> 07:10.160
With me and Charlotte,
it's a flame that's always burning.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.600
It's always like...

07:11.680 --> 07:15.640
It's always gonna be weird watching
Charlotte necking on with another lad

07:15.720 --> 07:18.240
but there's nothing
I can do about it, period.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.080
That's the tricky thing for me.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.520
Howay, party.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.120
Let's get our bathers on.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.240
There's hardly a feather
left in sight

07:34.320 --> 07:37.720
so the cleaning crew are celebrating
with a dip in the hot tub.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.040
The lads might think
they've ditched us

07:40.120 --> 07:44.000
but this is the perfect time for me
to crack on with the birds.

07:44.080 --> 07:46.440
I wish it was just me and Marty
in this hot tub

07:46.520 --> 07:49.360
because I'd love to put my fingers
through his quiff.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.560
I don't know about Hugh Hefner,
Marty.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.800
More like a skinnier, thicker,

07:56.880 --> 08:00.000
slightly less good-looking version
of Justin Bieber.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.400
So, who's gone with who?

08:01.480 --> 08:04.640
I've necked on with every girl here
and I've had sex with two.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.000
No! I did not expect this chat.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.560
If my dick gets any harder,

08:09.640 --> 08:12.040
I'm gonna knock Chantelle
out the hot tub.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.080
Yeah, all the time.

08:17.280 --> 08:21.760
Football was wicked. We're knackered.
Let's just hope the house is tidy.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.560
Hey. Anyone here?
We get back to the house

08:24.640 --> 08:26.880
and it's dead.
Where the fuck is everyone?

08:26.960 --> 08:27.960
Hello?

08:31.080 --> 08:33.000
Hi, boys.
How was football?

08:33.080 --> 08:34.560
(laughter)
Class.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.880
Was it?Marty's in the hot tub
thinking he's some boy.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.400
Marty, bar Chantelle,
between us three,

08:40.480 --> 08:43.720
we've banged every single bird
in that hot tub so shh.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.560
Aye.
Start drinking, mate!

08:53.200 --> 08:56.040
After getting in Chantelle's
good books last night,

08:56.120 --> 08:59.400
I'm gonna try and work my magic
tonight and get in her knickers.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.040
Definitely?
Fucking rights.

09:02.120 --> 09:05.360
What pisses me off is that
Marty's came here, dropped me in it

09:05.440 --> 09:08.440
and fucked things up
between me and Chantelle.Marty?

09:09.560 --> 09:12.240
Is this new kid
having a fucking laugh?

09:12.320 --> 09:15.800
You'd've thought he'd steer clear
of Chantelle after last night.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.960
I don't know why you think
it bothers us.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.840
Why did you swill us yesterday?
I was more pissed off -

09:20.920 --> 09:23.080
You were.
The lads say things in this room

09:23.160 --> 09:26.400
and you shouldn't be a grass.
This is the perfect opportunity

09:26.480 --> 09:29.680
to talk to Marty and explain
how we do things in this house.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.560
If you wanna pull Chantelle,
fair enough.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.560
It's fair game. But don't use things
we're saying and drop them in

09:36.640 --> 09:38.440
to try and get her.

09:38.520 --> 09:42.000
Fair enough. I don't really know
how things work in this house

09:42.080 --> 09:44.640
but I know I will neck on
with Chantelle.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.920
So, Marnie.
Is tonight the night with Aaron?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.320
Possibly.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.840
That's the million dollar question.
I really wanna sleep with him

09:58.920 --> 10:00.960
but something always gets in the way.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.880
Aaron's not very good at that.
Get him to play with your clit.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.560
He's done that before
and it fucking hurt.Ugh.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.520
Aaron needs to spend less time
in the tattoo shop

10:11.600 --> 10:14.840
and more time working on
his fanny skills. He sounds shite.

10:14.920 --> 10:18.640
Howay, should we go downstairs
and get a drink? Let's go get PV!

10:18.720 --> 10:20.680
There's a lot of tension
in this house

10:20.760 --> 10:24.320
so let's go out tonight, have no
drama and put everything behind we.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.800
What if someone gets
their chopper sucked?

10:26.880 --> 10:30.240
I'm buzzing. It's time to get
to the club and do what we do best.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.560
Get fucking smashed.

10:33.400 --> 10:37.080
I am just hoping
for a chilled out night.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.200
We just all need to enjoy ourselves.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.760
When I'm out with these guys,
I don't miss being on the pull

10:49.840 --> 10:52.360
because I'm happy enough
in my relationship.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.960
Aaron wants to talk about
what I told him last night.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.760
This is so fucking awkward.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.720
She blames the L-bomb
on being drunk.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.840
Which suits me. As long as we're OK,
we can still crack on.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.240
Get in. Last night
I scored major Brownie points

11:20.320 --> 11:22.800
when it comes to Marnie
so tonight, basically,

11:22.880 --> 11:24.840
I should be in
for some sort of reward.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.040
(indistinct)

11:31.120 --> 11:34.760
Me and Charlotte are getting on so
well and she is looking fit tonight

11:34.840 --> 11:38.240
but I shouldn't be thinking that
because I've got a girlfriend.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.400
Last night I told Gary

11:46.480 --> 11:49.080
that I wouldn't kiss other boys
if he was single.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.840
And it hasn't seemed
to scare him off. Great!

11:58.080 --> 12:00.760
Chantelle's one of the fittest birds
in this house

12:00.840 --> 12:04.480
and I've told the lads I'm gonna
pull her so let the grafting begin.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.400
Scott is proper pissed off.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.640
Telling Marty that he was gonna
move on if I didn't shag him?

12:11.720 --> 12:14.720
Now it's my turn to piss him off
by flirting with Marty.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.440
I'm sure Marty thinks he's winding
us up, the fucking divvy,

12:19.520 --> 12:23.040
but what he's doing is taking
Chantelle off my hands. See ya!

12:24.960 --> 12:27.920
Fucking hell. What is going on
with Chantelle and Marty?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.080
Does every lad I try and graft
fancy her?

12:30.160 --> 12:32.360
I am bothered
but I'm not gonna kick off.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.760
The secret to pulling is telling
birds what they want to hear.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.120
It never, ever fails.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.800
It's time to go in
and seal the deal. Watch and learn.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.360
Hold on. This is a bit much.
I was happy to flirt with Marty

12:54.440 --> 12:57.680
to wind up Scott but there's no way
I'm necking on with him.

13:00.600 --> 13:04.840
Howay, man, Marty. You really are
making a fucking dick of yourself.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.160
I actually thought I was in there.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.840
The lads are gonna think
I'm a pure fucking idiot.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.840
I've been feeling so down all day
and I really wanted tonight

13:17.920 --> 13:20.760
to cheer me up but now that
I'm here, I just feel lost.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.880
Holly's obviously
not having a good night

13:23.960 --> 13:27.720
and it's getting to the point where
I literally don't know what to do.

13:27.800 --> 13:31.240
You all right? This is so hard.
I'm finding it impossible

13:31.320 --> 13:34.720
to have a good time with people
who don't accept my boyfriend.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.120
Now that Marty's taken Chantelle
off my hands,

13:39.200 --> 13:41.800
I can crack on with
this wicked little blondie.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.640
Seeing Scott on the pull does hurt us

13:47.720 --> 13:50.600
and I'm glad that Marty telt us
he was just after a bang

13:50.680 --> 13:52.600
cos now I've seen his true colours.

14:02.960 --> 14:06.560
Tonight's been mint. Let's get back
to the fucking house.

14:08.160 --> 14:10.960
I didn't want to give Chantelle
any reason to kick off

14:11.040 --> 14:14.040
so I'm gonna say see you later
to this naughty blonde lass

14:14.120 --> 14:17.760
but don't worry. I'm sure you and
my chopper will cross paths again.

14:25.360 --> 14:29.840
I'm pure starving. Chicken dippers,
chicken nuggets, turkey dinosaurs.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.960
I don't care.
Just get me to them now!

14:32.040 --> 14:33.400
Get in, son!

14:36.360 --> 14:39.880
When I'm pissed, I wanna eat
and once I've ate, I wanna go to bed

14:39.960 --> 14:41.600
but there's just one problem.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.000
(cackles) If Nathan's got my quilt,
he's gonna piss all over it.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.360
I need to get it back.

14:48.520 --> 14:52.240
I will not give up this quilt
without a fight.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.840
Agh!

14:53.920 --> 14:56.000
(laughter)

15:01.880 --> 15:05.080
Charlotte, Holly and Chantelle
are all tucked up in bed

15:05.160 --> 15:08.160
so I'm gonna go and see
if Aaron fancies a cheeky spoon.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.560
Ending up in bed with Marnie
is the perfect end to a good night.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.680
And who knows?
I might even get a bang.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.160
Yeah -
No, you can't.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.520
I think that's quite hairy.
Sorry, Aaron.

15:19.600 --> 15:23.360
There's nae chance you're going
anywhere near my fanny in that state.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.680
There's always tomorrow night,
though.

15:27.680 --> 15:31.080
I don't wanna sleep on my own
so Nathan, it's your lucky night.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.920
Budge over!

15:33.000 --> 15:37.200
I get in my room to have a kip
and Marnie and Aaron are in my bed.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.440
Fuck this. I'm off to kip
in the Shag Pad.

15:54.640 --> 15:58.080
I've woken up in the boys' room
and I see Marnie in bed with Aaron.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.520
Let's get back to where we belong.
Morning.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.560
Morning. Good morning,
you dirty little stop-outs.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.880
Where the fuck have you two been?
Marns?

16:05.960 --> 16:07.560
Mm-hm.
You slept with Aaron?

16:07.640 --> 16:09.320
Mm-hm.
Did anything happen?

16:09.400 --> 16:12.400
There was no sex.
I do wanna have sex with Aaron

16:12.480 --> 16:15.280
but I need to shave my fairy first.

16:15.360 --> 16:18.280
Martin was being very flirty
last night, wouldn't he?

16:18.360 --> 16:21.080
I was just like,
"Fucking God, give me strength."

16:21.160 --> 16:24.400
I do like Marty but last night
he was all over Chantelle.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.440
I don't want to look like a mug
again like I did with Scott

16:27.520 --> 16:29.440
so I'm gonna keep this one
to myself.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.880
I do think he's sexy and that.
Perfect, my type completely

16:32.960 --> 16:35.000
but after the way
he went on last night,

16:35.080 --> 16:38.560
honestly, it's put us off for life.
I don't like Martin, honestly.

16:38.640 --> 16:41.880
Fair enough, Chloe. He was acting
like a pure dick last night.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.600
It's enough to put anyone off.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.840
Ugh. I've woken up in the Shag Pad
pure lonely and missing my lads

16:49.920 --> 16:52.960
so I'm off to see what the craic is.
Hello, mate.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.120
Mate, you've done me right over.
The man himself.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.800
Scott, one - Marty, nil
after last night, like.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.800
Trying to pull Chantelle last night
went fucking west.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.600
At least I've always got Chloe there
for a frisk.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.800
Me and Marnie
always have a good night

17:09.880 --> 17:11.800
but we still haven't banged yet

17:11.880 --> 17:14.360
and my balls are getting
very fucking heavy.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.560
Since Marnie's not putting out,
I reckon it could be

17:17.640 --> 17:20.720
fucking tattoo shop time,
get Marnie's name on ya.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.440
(sighs) Aye.
She might put out.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.160
I am not getting Marnie's name
tattooed on me.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.720
Get a fucking wicked henna.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.840
I do think Marnie
is playing hard to get

17:28.920 --> 17:31.720
so if she thinks that I've got
her name tattooed on me,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.440
it might help us seal the deal.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.360
Let's just have a bacon sandwich.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.040
(phone rings)
I'll get it.(all groan)

17:42.120 --> 17:45.200
The phone goes and there's only one
tight-arse it could be

17:45.280 --> 17:48.080
still using landlines these days.
It must be Anna.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.440
(chuckles) Will do. Time to gather
the fucking party crew

17:55.520 --> 17:56.800
and share the good news.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.560
We've got a Geor-day Tours activity
today.

17:59.640 --> 18:03.760
So it's me, Marty, Holly, Charlotte,
Marnie and Chloe.

18:03.840 --> 18:07.480
Scott's saying I have to go to work.
What's the craic with the tours?

18:07.640 --> 18:11.320
Anna sends us to test out events.
Holly, you need a sports bra.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.840
I don't like sports.
I don't like sports bras.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.080
I don't really like anything.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.720
Howay, now we gotta graft.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.240
See you later.
Bye!

18:25.440 --> 18:27.520
I think for a laugh...

18:31.040 --> 18:33.040
I'm not sure this is a great idea

18:33.120 --> 18:35.080
but it's the best idea we've got.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.840
So if you got Marns in there
and you went,

18:37.920 --> 18:41.760
"Marnie, spot something different?"
she'd be like, "What? (gasps)"

18:41.840 --> 18:46.000
If this works, it will be amazing.
If it doesn't, it'll be hilarious.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.480
Let's just get it done.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.880
Oh, God.
Today, what's it gonna be like?

18:54.960 --> 18:56.000
It's gonna be shit.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.680
Work is always shit.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.840
And these days
Holly's not much fun either.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.640
Cheers, Anna.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.200
Howay, pure lethal, this!

19:05.280 --> 19:07.280
Anna has sent us all trampolining.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.920
I'm so good at this.
I'm gonna impress everyone.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.640
(all squeal)

19:13.720 --> 19:15.000
(all) Whoooo!

19:15.080 --> 19:16.080
I'm pure buzzing.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.080
Going proper radge!

19:18.160 --> 19:20.480
Ohhhh! Fucking cracked!

19:23.000 --> 19:24.800
Holly is so bad at trampolining.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.840
Like, embarrassingly bad at it.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.880
It must be something to do
with the gravity in them tits.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.880
I've pissed myself.

19:31.960 --> 19:35.520
Ugh, it's every time I bounce!
It's not just when Charlotte's drunk

19:35.600 --> 19:36.880
that she pisses herself

19:36.960 --> 19:40.600
cos now she's pissed herself on a
fucking trampoline! I can smell it!

19:40.680 --> 19:43.000
It doesn't smell!
It smells like chicken.

19:43.080 --> 19:46.360
How the fuck does Charlotte get
her piss to smell like chicken?

19:46.440 --> 19:48.440
I'm jealous. I love chicken.

19:48.520 --> 19:52.520
(giggling)For a single lad like me
to have a back-up like Chloe

19:52.600 --> 19:54.600
is fucking cush.
She's a bit of a goer

19:54.680 --> 19:58.000
and a proper laugh so I'm buzzing
she's in this house. Ow!

19:58.080 --> 19:59.520
Nearly snapped us in half.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.240
I know I told the girls earlier
I don't like Marty

20:02.320 --> 20:04.440
but that was a big fat lie.
I do like him.

20:04.520 --> 20:09.200
He's funny, he's fit and his hair...
Ooooh! I love his hair!

20:10.440 --> 20:14.600
I cannot wait to get back to the
house, get ready and go on the lash.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.880
Me and Gary have been looking
for henna tattoos.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.080
All we could find
is a sheet of fake ones.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.960
Marnie's not the sharpest

20:31.040 --> 20:34.560
so hopefully she won't know
the difference. I reckon this one.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.920
If you don't even get a tug, mate,
you're gonna look like a mug.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.440
I'm putting the tattoo on and
I'm putting it in the right shape

20:41.520 --> 20:44.320
but Aaron, this looks... shit.

20:45.320 --> 20:48.400
Obviously, I'm not telling him that.
What does it look like

20:48.480 --> 20:51.360
if she's looking from there?
I would think that's real.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.920
There's no mirror in the bathroom
so I can't see

20:54.000 --> 20:56.600
but Gary said it looks real
so that's good enough.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.840
This is gonna be my lucky night.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.480
We've had a brilliant day
trampolining.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.000
I just can't wait
to carry on the fun tonight.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.720
We're getting ready for the night,
everyone's in a cush mood

21:11.800 --> 21:13.280
and getting along perfect.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.840
We, us girls, are on top.
We're gonna pull. Amen.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.280
Amen.
Amen!

21:21.360 --> 21:24.800
I'm really hoping to pull tonight
and Marty is on top of my list.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.160
You sexy bastard.

21:26.240 --> 21:29.280
Let's all just have a laugh
and get wrecked.(all cheer)

21:29.360 --> 21:33.440
We're all looking mint. I can't wait
to get to that fucking club.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.560
Howay, kid.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.680
We get to the club
and it's off the fucking hook.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.240
I cannot wait to get mortal
with everyone.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.360
I'm a single lad with needs

22:02.440 --> 22:05.760
and that dress is making Chloe
look fucking unbelievable.

22:12.160 --> 22:15.040
Fooling around with Marty
has helped me get over Scott

22:15.120 --> 22:17.720
and now I feel like he's my main man
in the house.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.320
# I don't know you
# Think you're good enough

22:20.400 --> 22:23.280
# For me to show you
# Hold two seconds while I toast to

22:23.360 --> 22:25.560
# All the beautiful women
I never spoke to

22:25.640 --> 22:27.680
# Close to most to
My beverage chose you

22:27.760 --> 22:30.200
# Standing at the bar
sipping on a Corona... #

22:30.280 --> 22:32.520
It's now time to show my fake tat
to Marnie

22:32.600 --> 22:36.400
and I'm not gonna lie,
I am absolutely shitting myself.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.920
Oh, my God. What is Aaron up to?

22:45.800 --> 22:47.440
What?! No, he hasn't.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.520
Are you joking?

22:50.600 --> 22:52.880
Where?
There.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.360
(all scream)

22:55.440 --> 22:57.360
What the fuck?

22:57.440 --> 23:00.960
This is what I've been waiting for.
I can't believe he's done it.

23:04.040 --> 23:07.320
I'm looking at the tattoo
and I'm not sure if it's real or not.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.920
One word springs to mind, Aaron.
Prick.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.440
(laughs)

23:17.840 --> 23:20.520
How? Fuck. This is not going well.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.160
But you've got Chantelle
on your wrist.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.280
Marnie's just got that look
in her eye.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.680
That look that says,
"You fucking dick!

23:29.760 --> 23:32.760
How could you get Chantelle's name
written on your arm

23:32.840 --> 23:35.680
and get that fake sticker shit
on your back for me?!"

23:38.600 --> 23:41.960
There's only one way to get over
this. Pass the fucking vodka.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.680
Fuck it. I'm gonna flirt with Marty
to get back at Aaron

23:59.760 --> 24:01.080
for that stupid tattoo.

24:03.080 --> 24:06.960
Oi, oi, what's all this? Marnie's
after a bit of Marty from the party?

24:09.160 --> 24:11.160
What the fuck is going on
over there?

24:11.240 --> 24:13.920
It looks like Marnie
is trying to flirt with Marty.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.920
What are you playing at?
I'll give you a peck.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.680
Did I just see Marnie kiss Marty?

24:25.600 --> 24:26.720
When?

24:27.880 --> 24:30.960
I can't believe Marnie
has actually kissed Marty.

24:31.040 --> 24:34.560
She is supposed to be my best friend
and I thought I could trust her.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.320
Marnie has totally broken girl code.

24:38.400 --> 24:41.360
Even if I had the slightest inkling
that one of my friends

24:41.440 --> 24:44.640
fancied a boy, I wouldn't go there
and that's the end of it.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.720
(guffaws)

24:49.800 --> 24:52.720
I knew Marnie would do something
stupid to get me back

24:52.800 --> 24:54.680
for the fake tattoo
and a while ago,

24:54.760 --> 24:58.600
I probably would've kicked off but
tonight I'm not gonna rise to it.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.960
We're all ready to go home.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.800
Oh, wait. No, we're not.
Chloe is kicking off.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.080
I fucking lost it with Marnie.

25:14.160 --> 25:18.160
She's kissed Marty and she knows
not to go there, you fucking bitch!

25:18.240 --> 25:21.120
You've been all over him!What?
Yes, you have.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.720
What the fuck is going on?

25:22.800 --> 25:25.920
Chloe is laying into me
just for giving Marty a little peck.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.720
(both shout)

25:28.800 --> 25:31.520
We need to separate these girls,
get them in the taxi

25:31.600 --> 25:34.200
and hope things cool off
by the time we get home.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.520
I don't understand
why yous are arguing.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.160
Because she's two-faced!

25:38.240 --> 25:40.880
This morning she was saying
she doesn't like Marty

25:40.960 --> 25:44.680
and now she's all up in my face for
having a little flirt. What a twat.

25:44.760 --> 25:48.080
If she was a true friend,
she'd be honest with us. She hasn't.

25:51.560 --> 25:52.560
I understand.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.520
I get where Chloe's coming from

25:54.600 --> 25:56.960
because Marnie's done it to me
in the past.

25:57.040 --> 26:00.160
She fucking got with Gary
for about fucking...

26:00.240 --> 26:02.960
Exactly. She didn't care
about your feelings then.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.440
She didn't care then. No.

26:04.520 --> 26:07.040
We're all sat in the taxi
winding each other up.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.720
Everyone is saying their piece
and getting angrier and angrier.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.360
I am so scared for when we get back
in the house.

26:17.040 --> 26:21.600
I walk in the house
and I am absolutely fucking furious.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.920
I've had way too many tequilas
to let this out the right way.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.160
Man, you're a two-faced bitch.
Marnie's having a go at me.

26:28.240 --> 26:31.640
She's the one in the wrong but I can
tell she's had too much to drink

26:31.720 --> 26:33.760
so I don't want to talk to her
tonight.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.440
Do you wanna know why
I'm getting angry?

26:36.520 --> 26:38.240
You're supposed to be my friend.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.360
You're supposed to be
my best friend!

26:40.440 --> 26:44.040
And your wouldn't tell us! Chloe's
constantly lying to her friends

26:44.120 --> 26:47.880
about liking boys. She did it with
Scott, now she's doing it with Marty.

26:47.960 --> 26:50.880
It's fucking annoying. I asked you!

26:50.960 --> 26:53.920
I can hear Marnie going in on Chloe
downstairs.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
She's got no fucking right.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.000
I've got Chloe's back on this one.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.520
You're a two-faced cunt.
I'm not two-faced!

27:00.600 --> 27:02.000
She's not!
She fucking...

27:02.080 --> 27:05.880
I'm having an argument with Chloe
and Charlotte storms down the stairs.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.160
What the hell is she piping up about?
Don't fucking start!

27:09.240 --> 27:11.640
All I can think about
is Marnie shagging Gary.

27:11.720 --> 27:15.440
Let me at that bitch.
I'm gonna take her head clean off!

27:15.520 --> 27:16.680
(both shouting)

27:16.760 --> 27:19.840
Whoa!You're gonna come
in my personal space, Charlotte,

27:19.920 --> 27:22.520
you're gonna lose
some fucking hair extensions.

27:22.600 --> 27:26.360
Stop it! Charlotte and Marnie have
launched themselves at each other

27:26.440 --> 27:29.600
like two fucking rockets in space.
(all shouting)

27:29.680 --> 27:31.480
Hey, hey.
Fucking hate you!

27:31.560 --> 27:34.160
I thought this was meant to be
a family.Get off us!

27:34.240 --> 27:35.760
Marnie. Marnie!
Get off us!

27:35.840 --> 27:38.120
More like a Bigg Market
fucking bash-up.

27:38.200 --> 27:41.880
Slag! You shag anyone's boyfriend!

27:41.960 --> 27:44.840
Marnie needs to learn that
she can't go after our lads.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.480
It's fucking out of order!

27:46.560 --> 27:51.800
You fucking shag anyone's boyfriend
behind our fucking back!

27:51.880 --> 27:54.960
Once I shagged Gary.
Big deal. Get over it.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.200
Listen!

27:56.280 --> 27:57.360
(all shouting)

27:57.440 --> 27:59.400
Marnie. Marnie.
Marnie.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.480
Enough's enough.
I hate seeing Charlotte like this.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.760
Supposed to be best friends.
Fuck this.

28:04.840 --> 28:07.440
This needs to stop
so I'm gonna get hold of Marnie.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.600
Get the fuck out.
Supposed to be bestfriends!
Stop it.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.520
You're supposed to be
my best friend!

28:13.600 --> 28:16.800
But I hate you.That's fine
but you're gonna stay here.

28:16.880 --> 28:19.160
I've had countless arguments
in this house

28:19.240 --> 28:23.120
and for once, Aaron has actually got
my back. I appreciate it so much.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.680
Give me a hug. Give me a hug.

28:24.760 --> 28:28.360
When Charlotte's like this,
nobody can calm her down but me.

28:28.440 --> 28:32.200
I'll always have your back. You know
I'll never let you kick off, right?

28:32.280 --> 28:34.280
I'm so upset about what's happened.

28:34.360 --> 28:38.120
I can't believe it's come to me
and Marnie having a massive fight.

28:38.200 --> 28:42.040
The one person there for us is Gary.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.640
And I'm so thankful
I've got him in this house.

28:46.800 --> 28:47.800
Go to bed.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.360
In the past, I've never been there
for Marnie

28:51.440 --> 28:54.040
but tonight things have changed.
It's my fault

28:54.120 --> 28:56.200
so there's no way
I'm leaving her side.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.760
I've had a disaster of a night

28:59.840 --> 29:03.080
and the only person giving us support
at the end of it is Aaron.

29:03.160 --> 29:06.760
He's definitely redeemed himself
after that sticker incident.

29:19.120 --> 29:22.560
(both laugh) I want to be there
for Charlotte in a time like this

29:22.640 --> 29:24.880
but having a girlfriend
makes it so hard.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.040
(both giggle)

29:32.120 --> 29:34.760
Fucking hell. This is a head-fuck.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.200
You all right?

29:37.280 --> 29:39.120
(Charlotte kisses)
OK?Mm-hm.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.920
I need to get out of this bed.

30:06.320 --> 30:09.560
Morning. God.
Last night was brutal, wasn't it?

30:09.640 --> 30:13.440
I've woken up and I'm still so
shocked at what happened last night.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.840
All I was doing was sticking up
for you. She lashed out at me first

30:16.920 --> 30:17.920
and now look.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.320
I've known Marnie
for a very long time now

30:20.400 --> 30:24.240
and this is the worst fight
we have ever, ever had.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.240
I don't know if there's
any coming back from this.

30:27.320 --> 30:30.680
I'm not gonna lie, I do think
the whole pecking him thing

30:30.760 --> 30:32.560
was blew out of proportion a bit.

30:32.640 --> 30:36.600
I can't believe they've all turned
on Marnie over a fucking peck.

30:36.680 --> 30:39.680
You have said you don't like Martin
like that any more.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.280
I am gutted that Marty kissed Marnie
last night because I do like him

30:43.360 --> 30:45.400
and I wish he only had eyes for me.

30:45.480 --> 30:48.120
Well, this is gonna be an awkward day
in the house.

30:54.640 --> 30:58.120
I don't know why Chloe especially
got so wound up over me and you.

30:58.200 --> 31:01.840
I'm devastated the way things went
last night. It kicked clean off

31:01.920 --> 31:04.920
and it was partly cos of me.
I do need to try harder to fit in

31:05.000 --> 31:08.200
but at the end of the day,
I'm a lad and I fancy these birds.

31:08.280 --> 31:12.000
There's a lot of unsaid issues
between yous lot

31:12.080 --> 31:14.520
that last night just all came out.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.520
It started with me and Chloe arguing

31:16.600 --> 31:19.680
and then for some sick, twisted
reason the me and Gary thing

31:19.760 --> 31:22.640
got brought up last night.
I thought me and Charlotte

31:22.720 --> 31:24.800
had put that behind us
but clearly not.

31:24.880 --> 31:28.320
What happened with you and Char
when you were calming her down?

31:28.400 --> 31:31.920
I don't know why Char was kicking off
but I hate when the girls fight.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.640
Things between me and Charlotte
are weird. She got jealous of Marnie

31:35.720 --> 31:38.160
and we ended up having
a little cuddle in bed.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.160
I feel like I need
to sort my head out.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.720
(sighs) I need to get out
of this house.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.120
Do you?

31:56.080 --> 31:58.880
The tension is that thick,
you can cut it with a knife.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.440
Me, Holly and Charlotte
need to get out of here.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.760
Wrap up cos it's cold.

32:10.840 --> 32:12.600
I'm so glad to be out of the house.

32:12.680 --> 32:16.080
It's nice to spend time with
the girls without feeling awkward.

32:16.160 --> 32:19.560
When I woke up, I felt bad.
I don't wanna have a physical fight

32:19.640 --> 32:22.880
with anybody. I don't wanna do that,
especially not Marnie.

32:22.960 --> 32:26.840
I love her to bits.
This is so bad. I feel like shit.

32:26.920 --> 32:29.680
I'm shocked the way she's gone on
with me cos I thought

32:29.760 --> 32:32.520
she was my best friend.
I can't be arsed to speak to her

32:32.600 --> 32:35.360
when I get back.
Chloe might not always be honest

32:35.440 --> 32:37.640
but at the end of the day,
Marnie fucked up.

32:37.720 --> 32:41.000
What happened with Gary last night?
Yeah, he was spooning us

32:41.080 --> 32:45.360
to make us feel better cos he never
used to spoon us in the olden days,

32:45.440 --> 32:47.520
which was nice.
It made us feel better.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.640
I like that Gary was there
for Charlotte but it worries me

32:50.720 --> 32:54.040
them getting so close, especially
since Gary has a girlfriend

32:54.120 --> 32:56.720
and Charlotte is single.
This is not gonna work.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.520
I wonder if I can neck.
I can't even neck apple Sourz.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.040
Do it, do it.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.240
That's not a neck.
Can't do it.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.320
(laughs)

33:15.200 --> 33:18.920
I'm in the gym with Gaz and I can't
help but think something's up.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.560
Howay, mate. Spit it out.

33:35.120 --> 33:38.840
Since I've been in a relationship,
me and Charlotte haven't been close

33:38.920 --> 33:42.520
and that's because she is single
and it makes things even harder.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.680
I wouldn't say that Gary
wants to be with Charlotte,

33:52.760 --> 33:56.160
I just think he wants to be
near Charlotte when he's with Lillie

33:56.240 --> 33:57.840
because that is too tempting.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.440
Will you come back, though?

34:04.040 --> 34:06.400
We all know Gaz has got
a heart of stone

34:06.480 --> 34:08.520
but I've never seen him
this stressed.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.600
I'm just hoping that kid
comes back through that door.

34:12.480 --> 34:15.000
Thank you, Aaron, for listening.
I'm off.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.920
Hopefully... I'll see you soon.

34:29.840 --> 34:30.840
Hi.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.680
Recently, this family
has been broken into pieces

34:36.760 --> 34:40.560
but I need to gather them so I can
tell them the bad news about Gary.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.400
Girls. Boys.

34:42.480 --> 34:46.080
Hold on. Aaron's called everyone
downstairs. This sounds serious.

34:46.160 --> 34:49.640
Has he got Marnie pregnant? Oh,
wait. He'd have to bang her first.

34:49.720 --> 34:52.400
I talked to Gaz before.
He said, "After last night,

34:52.480 --> 34:55.080
I need to leave.
My head's all over the place."

34:55.160 --> 34:57.920
What the fuck?
Are you fucking radge?

34:58.000 --> 34:59.560
So he's gone?
He just left.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.880
I can tell Charlotte
is fucking gutted.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.480
We have to wait and see.
He'll be fine.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.840
He'll be back soon.
He just needs a break.

35:07.920 --> 35:11.040
Can't believe that Gary's even gone
without saying bye.

35:11.120 --> 35:14.880
We've been so close this time
around, I surely would've thought

35:14.960 --> 35:16.960
he would've spoken to me about it.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.200
I'm a bit gutted that he's gone.
I am.(phone rings)

35:23.280 --> 35:24.480
You go.
I'll get it.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.440
The phone rings and I know for a fact
it's gonna be Anna.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.720
Me and Charlotte are gonna be
in deep shit.

35:29.800 --> 35:33.000
(Anna)"I heard about last night.
Fighting with Charlotte,

35:33.080 --> 35:36.200
totally unacceptable.
Yous two are gonna have to stay in

35:36.280 --> 35:37.880
and no booze tonight either."

35:37.960 --> 35:41.400
To be honest, you couldn't have made
my day any worse, Anna. Do one.

35:41.480 --> 35:45.200
Me and Charlotte have gotta stay in
and not drink. She was pissed off.

35:45.280 --> 35:49.040
Fucking hell. Anna's a strict boss.
Mustn't have shagged in pure ages.

35:49.120 --> 35:52.320
What did she say about the rest
of us? She didn't mention you.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.000
This could not get any awkwarder.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.120
I'm kind of gutted Gaz is gone

36:06.200 --> 36:09.440
but I'm also gutted he didn't
speak to me about his problems.

36:09.520 --> 36:13.360
If he'd told you, you'd be like,
"No, no. Try and stick it out"

36:13.440 --> 36:15.560
but the tone of his voice,
he had to go.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.200
Gaz isn't here, which means
nae kick-offs for me

36:18.280 --> 36:21.080
so I can just be Marty
from the party.

36:21.160 --> 36:24.040
# How it goes in the morning

36:24.120 --> 36:26.200
# No warning... #

36:26.280 --> 36:29.400
I wonder if Charlotte and Marnie
will talk tonight.

36:29.480 --> 36:32.720
It's a good opportunity to take
if they wanna sort things out.

36:32.800 --> 36:35.640
They're on their own
with no distractions.That's it.

36:35.720 --> 36:39.720
Charlotte and Marnie have to stay
home. That is gonna be so awkward.

36:39.800 --> 36:43.520
I just hope they don't fight again.
I'm going out dressing like a tramp.

36:43.600 --> 36:47.320
Tramp nights are the best nights,
though. You have a whale of a time.

36:48.320 --> 36:51.320
It's gonna be weird tonight
not having Gary or Marnie

36:51.400 --> 36:54.720
or Charlotte there but I'm hoping
tonight will be a good night.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.920
And please, no fucking kick-offs.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.240
Have a good night in the kennel!
Let's go fucking mental!

37:00.320 --> 37:03.200
As far as I'm concerned,
me and Chantelle are history

37:03.280 --> 37:07.080
so I'm gonna go out tonight and pure
clean up Newcastle with my cock.

37:14.560 --> 37:18.160
We get to the club, I'm already
pissed and there's more drink there.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.360
Fucking bring it on.

37:25.880 --> 37:27.880
Marty is looking unreal.

37:27.960 --> 37:31.200
I just hope he's up for some action
with me tonight.

37:33.080 --> 37:36.080
Marty's a bit of a liability
but he reminds me of Chloe.

37:36.160 --> 37:39.760
I hope he finds his place in this
house before he causes more shit.

37:45.160 --> 37:47.760
I really do understand
how Chloe must be feeling.

37:47.840 --> 37:51.080
I know she's pissed off with Marnie
but she must miss her.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.400
Are you fucking surprised?
You shouldn't accept him

38:07.480 --> 38:09.640
the way he treated you
in fucking Greece.

38:11.400 --> 38:14.680
Tonight is actually all right
and for once Marty's not going on

38:14.760 --> 38:17.440
like a fucking dork
like every other night.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.880
I'm having such a belter night.

38:22.960 --> 38:26.560
And who would've thought,
I'm even dancing with Chloe.

38:26.640 --> 38:30.440
Now with Scott out of the picture,
we're getting on really well.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.720
Marty is just basically shit
at everything

38:35.800 --> 38:38.640
so me and Scott are gonna bring
two birds to the area.

38:38.720 --> 38:42.400
I'm gonna keep my distance and watch
Scott and Marty fuck this up.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.880
This naughty little blondie
is proper keen

38:44.960 --> 38:47.840
and she's snogging my face up.
These two are in the bag.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.080
Only a fucking idiot
can mess this up.

38:52.560 --> 38:56.000
Fucking great. Marty is chatting up
some random lass in the club.

38:56.080 --> 38:59.520
That means nothing is gonna happen
between me and him tonight.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.200
I might as well go in for it.

39:07.240 --> 39:10.480
Fuck ye. I didn't wanna neck on
anyway. Where's Chloe?

39:10.560 --> 39:13.360
Oh, she's over there,
dancing like a divvy.

39:13.440 --> 39:16.640
It looks like Marty didn't pull.
I just hope he likes a rodeo

39:16.720 --> 39:18.760
cos I'm gonna ride him like a bull!

39:31.640 --> 39:34.640
Me and the others are all having
a wicked night tonight

39:34.720 --> 39:37.400
but all I can think about is Marnie.
I hope she's OK

39:37.480 --> 39:40.400
and her and Charlotte managed
to sort their shit out.

39:47.120 --> 39:50.040
It's beating us up knowing that
Marnie is downstairs

39:50.120 --> 39:53.840
and I'm up in the bedroom. I need to
go and speak to her and apologise.

39:57.320 --> 39:59.880
I'm sitting here,
getting myself all worked up.

39:59.960 --> 40:02.320
I don't know
what the fuck's gonna happen.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.480
There's so much
we need to talk about.

40:04.560 --> 40:08.480
I don't understand how you were
so quick to jump on me.

40:08.560 --> 40:11.720
I don't know, Marnie.
I can't answer the question.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.480
I was drunk and stupid.
I'm sorry for doing it.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.440
I'm embarrassed by my behaviour.

40:16.520 --> 40:19.560
Me and Marnie have come a long way.
I class her as a sister

40:19.640 --> 40:22.040
so there's a friendship
worth salvaging.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.800
I just sometimes feel attacked

40:23.880 --> 40:26.480
because I feel like
when it's me doing something,

40:26.560 --> 40:28.520
I get attacked more than anyone else.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.480
When Charlotte kissed Scott
in Greece, Chloe laughed.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.280
When Chantelle flirts with Marty,
it's no problem.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.640
When I do it,
everyone flies off the handle.

40:36.720 --> 40:40.000
You kept bringing up me and Gary.
Yeah, that's how I felt.

40:40.080 --> 40:43.160
That's how I related myself
to Chloe's situation.

40:43.240 --> 40:46.600
There was a time in the past when
I hated her for getting with Gary

40:46.680 --> 40:48.200
but it's not like that now.

40:48.280 --> 40:51.240
We were all very drunk.
I was drinking straight vodka.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.080
I'm sorry.

40:55.160 --> 40:58.960
This all boils down to all of us
being absolutely fucking mortal.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.560
Let's just blame the drink.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.280
Well, let's try not to do it again.
OK.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.440
I feel so bad that me and Charlotte
got physical

41:06.520 --> 41:08.560
but at the end of the day,
we're sisters

41:08.640 --> 41:10.280
and sisters fight sometimes.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.440
(sighs) How are you feeling
about the Gary thing?

41:15.520 --> 41:17.120
I got a bit of a shock.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.560
I don't know why he's gone
cos I don't think he would've went

41:21.640 --> 41:25.280
just cos there was arguments.
He's had full-on fights in the house

41:25.360 --> 41:26.440
and he's never left.

41:26.520 --> 41:30.040
There's definitely something
still there with Gary and Charlotte

41:30.120 --> 41:32.080
but you don't know what could happen.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.600
Given their history,
it could go either way.

41:34.680 --> 41:37.400
Everyone knows that
he's been different with ya.

41:37.480 --> 41:40.480
Yeah. If anything, it could be
something to do with that

41:40.560 --> 41:43.640
but it scares us a little bit
because what's he gonna do?

41:43.720 --> 41:46.400
What if he's gone
cos he can't be here any more?

41:46.480 --> 41:49.160
I just hope that he comes back soon.

41:49.240 --> 41:52.120
I honestly feel like
I've got a part of us missing.

41:53.240 --> 41:56.080
I've never lived in this house
without him here.

42:02.760 --> 42:02.960
.
