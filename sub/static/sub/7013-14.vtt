WEBVTT

00:04.003 --> 00:05.938
Okay, let me get this straight.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.975
After my grandpa's funeral,
Kelso and Annette are making out.

00:09.042 --> 00:13.069
Jackie sees them and yells,
''Get off my boyfriend''?

00:13.146 --> 00:14.909
<i>Right in front of you?</i>

00:14.981 --> 00:18.280
Yeah, it brought
the whole funeral way down.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.915
Hyde, that's horrible, man.

00:22.989 --> 00:24.923
You know what's even worse?

00:24.991 --> 00:27.152
I totally missed it.

00:27.227 --> 00:31.027
Yeah? Well, nobody else missed it.
Half the frickin' town was there.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.759
Today at The Hub, you know
that kid Jimmy with the headgear?

00:33.833 --> 00:38.634
He said he felt bad for me.
Jimmy Headgear felt bad for me!

00:40.573 --> 00:43.474
I knew it was a mistake hooking up
with Jackie, and I did it anyway.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.568
You know why?
'Cause she makes you stupid.

00:45.645 --> 00:48.876
I bet Kelso was composing
symphonies before her.

00:50.517 --> 00:52.951
Hyde.

00:53.019 --> 00:55.010
Man, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

00:55.088 --> 00:57.579
'Cause whatJackie
did to you was embarrassing.

00:59.559 --> 01:03.017
You must be so embarrassed.
I told a lot of people what happened...

01:03.096 --> 01:06.293
and they all agreed that it was...

01:06.366 --> 01:09.130
just really embarrassing.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.727
Kelso, now is not the time.

01:11.805 --> 01:15.866
I just wanna buck our boy up, 'cause what
happened to him was so embarrassing!

01:18.378 --> 01:20.369
That's it.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.608
Whoa, whoa!
Why don't we go upstairs.

01:22.682 --> 01:25.173
We got that new JCPenney catalog.

01:26.886 --> 01:29.411
There's a full-color section
on bras.

01:30.990 --> 01:34.118
Word has it the airbrush guy
totally missed a nipple.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.219
I don't know why he's so mad.

01:36.296 --> 01:39.493
I was just being sensitive!

01:39.566 --> 01:42.364
Well, be sensitive to me
because I'm upset too.

01:42.435 --> 01:45.131
If you expect me
to go to the Valentine's dance tonight...

01:45.205 --> 01:50.074
-you're gonna have to do a few things for me.
- For you or to you?

01:50.143 --> 01:54.011
Shut up! One:
You will not speak toJackie.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.880
Two: You will not speak to girls who have
brown hair likeJackie.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.250
Three: You will not speak toJackie.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.414
Wait.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.617
I got messed up.

02:05.692 --> 02:08.320
Yeah, baby, whatever
you want.Just-

02:10.463 --> 02:14.024
Man, it's great being
under someone's thumb again!

02:16.336 --> 02:19.237
What did your mother do to you?

02:19.305 --> 02:21.671
Man, I just feel bad for Hyde.

02:21.741 --> 02:24.266
I mean, Annette wants me.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.369
Jackie wants me.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.677
My good looks
are ruining people's lives.

02:29.749 --> 02:32.047
Well, Hyde seems pretty mad.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.052
Whatever, man.
I'm not afraid of him.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.554
- <i>( Eric ) He got away.!</i>
- Help me!

02:41.327 --> 02:44.763
So have you talked to Hyde about the whole
''get off my boyfriend'' disaster?

02:44.831 --> 02:48.562
No. And why is everyone
making such a big deal about it?

02:48.635 --> 02:51.695
Every time I walk into a room,
people look at me funny.

02:51.771 --> 02:53.705
Donna, how do you deal with it?

02:55.675 --> 02:58.337
Jackie, the reason people are making
a big deal about it...

02:58.411 --> 03:00.709
is because it sounds like you still have
feelings for Kelso.

03:00.780 --> 03:04.307
Well, I don't.
I think the only reason I said it...

03:04.384 --> 03:09.219
was because I was having an allergic reaction
to the Forman's cheap generic soda.

03:09.289 --> 03:11.280
( High-pitched )
Oh, no! A giant redhead!

03:11.357 --> 03:16.124
Please don't crush me!
Ple-e-ease!

03:16.196 --> 03:20.633
Fez, would you stop screwing around. Now,
did you finish the balloon walkway of love yet?

03:20.700 --> 03:23.692
You bet I did. When Nina sees it,
she's gonna be so impressed...

03:23.770 --> 03:27.797
her balloons will become my walkway of love,
if you know what I mean.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.774
Fez, that's disgusting.

03:30.977 --> 03:33.104
( High-pitched )
Oh, no, the giant's angry!

03:33.179 --> 03:36.410
Run for your life!
Run! Run!

04:16.789 --> 04:20.281
- Mrs. Forman, this chili is great.
- Thanks.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.922
Daddy used to love my chili.
Remember, Mom?

04:24.998 --> 04:27.831
I remember it gave him the toots.

04:31.170 --> 04:35.163
Well, that's a nice place
to start reminiscing.

04:35.241 --> 04:39.041
So, Eric, are you excited
about your big Valentine's dance?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.046
Yeah. I'm just glad it's in the gym.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.708
There's nothing like celebrating
the most romantic night of your life...

04:43.783 --> 04:47.184
in the room where I got
my first wedgie.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.649
It meant I liked you, Eric.

04:54.193 --> 04:57.890
If you don't mind, I'd like
to talk about my father.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.262
Well, Kitty, we can dwell
on what was...

05:00.333 --> 05:02.699
or we can talk about what is.

05:02.769 --> 05:05.465
If I've learned anything
from losing my Burtie Bear...

05:05.538 --> 05:07.563
it's that all that really matters...

05:07.640 --> 05:11.007
is making sure that the people
we love know we love them.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.875
Mom, that was wonderful.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.743
I mean it.

05:15.815 --> 05:19.114
Eric, I love you.

05:19.185 --> 05:22.120
Oh. Well, thanks, Grandma.

05:22.188 --> 05:24.679
Kitty.

05:24.757 --> 05:27.385
I think I'll go for a walk.

05:32.398 --> 05:35.595
( Chuckles )
Well, this was fun.

05:37.537 --> 05:40.370
I'm gonna go to bed for a few days.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.933
Oh, no.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.447
She hasn't done this
since Elvis died on the crapper.

05:53.186 --> 05:57.145
Now I've gotta sit by her bed for four days
and tell her that she's beautiful.

05:57.223 --> 06:01.626
It's hard to say that to
a cold-cream-smeared loony in bunny slippers.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.657
I remember that week.
The shades were drawn.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.600
The food supply ran low.

06:09.669 --> 06:12.968
We were sucking on bouillon
cubes to stay alive.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.473
Yeah, but did you hear
what your grandma said...

06:15.541 --> 06:18.704
about love being
the only thing that matters?

06:18.778 --> 06:21.212
- Eric, we should tell her that we're engaged.
- What?

06:21.280 --> 06:23.748
She could be the one person
who'd be happy for us.

06:23.816 --> 06:26.307
We're gonna need someone
on our side when we tell our families.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.549
Yeah. And you know what?
Even if she's not on our side...

06:29.622 --> 06:31.647
the minute Grandma
thinks it's a bad idea...

06:31.724 --> 06:35.717
my mom will be booking the big room
at the Holiday Inn just out of spite.

06:35.795 --> 06:38.127
So, it's a win-win.

06:38.197 --> 06:42.327
Yeah. We're gonna do what Luke Skywalker
was too afraid to do-

06:45.838 --> 06:48.363
use the Dark Side to our advantage.

06:52.278 --> 06:56.840
Eric, if we're gonna be married, you really
gotta ease up on the <i>Star Wars</i> stuff.

06:58.684 --> 07:01.084
All right? It doesn't
apply to everything.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.714
I'm gonna have to rewrite my vows.

07:11.030 --> 07:14.488
- My favorite song?
- Uh, ''The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.''

07:14.567 --> 07:16.728
The light I look best in?

07:16.803 --> 07:20.295
Uh, it's a tie between
20-watt, soft-pink bulbs...

07:20.373 --> 07:22.307
and mid-summer sunset.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.443
Very good, Michael.

07:25.511 --> 07:27.672
God, I missed this.

07:27.747 --> 07:31.683
Oh, hey. Have you guys seen Steven?

07:31.751 --> 07:35.551
I hear a weird, piercing noise,
but I don't know where it's coming from.

07:35.621 --> 07:39.079
- Do you hear anything, Michael?
- Yeah, it's justJackie.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.490
Uh,Jackie, I'm sorry you have
to see me in this T-shirt.

07:44.564 --> 07:47.533
I know how it emphasizes
my hunkalicious bod.

07:49.035 --> 07:52.436
Shut up, Michael.
I made a stupid slip. It meant nothing.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.666
Right, because Michael
is my boyfriend.

07:54.740 --> 07:57.004
I know he is, skank wad.

07:58.578 --> 08:02.844
- Oh, I'm a skank wad?
- Girl fight! Let's get it on!

08:06.519 --> 08:08.384
We are not gonna fight.

08:09.555 --> 08:13.184
Well, maybe you should kiss
and make up.

08:15.962 --> 08:18.294
Let's get it on!

08:19.499 --> 08:21.763
What? What? Wait.

08:23.703 --> 08:26.228
Ah, I'll go with the blonde.

08:30.276 --> 08:34.905
( Groans ) Kitty, I'm just going to
the corner to get you some soup.

08:34.981 --> 08:39.918
I'm not leaving you for somebody younger
and less dramatic.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.656
This is your fault.
If I wanna get my wife out of bed...

08:44.724 --> 08:47.818
I gotta tie a rope around her
and attach it to my bumper...

08:47.894 --> 08:50.055
and pull her out like a stump.

08:53.833 --> 08:56.063
So what were you saying, dear?

08:56.135 --> 09:01.198
Um, well, I was saying
that... I'm getting married.

09:01.274 --> 09:04.402
Oh, honey, how wonderful!

09:04.477 --> 09:06.502
So, who's the lucky girl?

09:11.551 --> 09:16.579
- Well, um, Donna.
- <i>Oh.</i>

09:17.657 --> 09:20.319
Well, I guess this is a small town.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.992
Okay, what the hell did that mean?

09:28.067 --> 09:30.535
That, my friend, is
the seldom heard...

09:30.603 --> 09:33.436
but much feared Grandma burn.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.708
Your only warning
is the jingle of costume jewelry...

09:40.780 --> 09:43.214
and the overpowering scent
of BenGay.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.915
Well, you and Jackie
are certainly a mess.

09:47.987 --> 09:51.855
I remember before Nina
when my love life was a mess.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.387
It's perfect now though.
Not like yours, which is a mess.

10:01.980 --> 10:03.971
Steven, I've called
three times in the last half hour.

10:04.316 --> 10:08.582
Figured it was you. All the calls came during
commercials in the <i>Newlywed Game.</i>

10:10.456 --> 10:14.017
So, what?
Now you're not taking my calls?

10:15.527 --> 10:17.552
Why are you making such
a big deal about this?

10:17.629 --> 10:20.860
Because it is a big deal when you yell,
''Get off my boyfriend''...

10:20.933 --> 10:24.699
- to a girl who's on someone who's not me.
- ( Groans )

10:24.770 --> 10:29.730
Steven, I cannot be held responsible
for the things that come out of my mouth.

10:33.011 --> 10:35.377
It didn't mean anything.

10:35.447 --> 10:38.473
So that's your story?
''It didn't mean anything''?

10:38.550 --> 10:43.146
Right. Right.
So, you just need to get over it.

10:43.222 --> 10:46.749
Oh, yeah. Don't worry.
I'm over it.

10:46.825 --> 10:49.191
In fact, I'm over you.

10:50.963 --> 10:52.897
Steven, what are you saying?

10:52.965 --> 10:55.695
He's saying he's breaking up with you.
Are you not paying attention?

10:55.767 --> 10:58.429
Because I'm on the edge
of my freakin' seat here.

11:04.076 --> 11:06.374
Steven.

11:10.349 --> 11:13.341
<i>( Door Opens, Closes )</i>

11:17.589 --> 11:21.457
So, I have a girlfriend
and you don't.

11:31.537 --> 11:35.234
So, my grandma doesn't think
Donna's good enough for me.

11:35.307 --> 11:38.834
How great is that?

11:38.911 --> 11:41.175
Finally, someone thinks
Donna's the lucky one.

11:41.246 --> 11:43.680
No more, ''Hey, how'd he get her?''

11:43.749 --> 11:47.879
Or, ''Oh, that skinny guy
must really be rich.''

11:47.953 --> 11:50.183
Yeah, that's right.
I heard the whispers.

11:50.255 --> 11:52.815
I just pretended not to.

11:52.891 --> 11:56.122
Who was whispering?
We said it right to you.

11:56.195 --> 11:58.959
Well, I'm done with Jackie,
and I feel like a guy...

11:59.031 --> 12:02.194
who had a 95-pound
mole removed-

12:02.267 --> 12:05.065
a 95-pound, Donny Osmond loving...

12:05.137 --> 12:08.868
shoe-shopping,
Ice Capade attending mole.

12:08.941 --> 12:13.901
Hyde, I know that's just coming
from a place of deep, deep pain.

12:13.979 --> 12:16.948
And I really do feel bad
that my ''foxitude''...

12:17.015 --> 12:19.279
broke you and Jackie up.

12:19.351 --> 12:23.014
And I'd tone it down,
but I just don't know how!

12:28.393 --> 12:32.727
Guys, I'm worried there's some unfinished
business between Michael and Jackie.

12:32.798 --> 12:36.325
When they were together,
did she make him happy?

12:36.401 --> 12:39.495
Well, she totally dominated him...

12:39.571 --> 12:42.506
and made him feel bad about himself.

12:42.574 --> 12:46.943
I guess what I'm asking is,
was she ever fat or anything?

12:52.150 --> 12:55.483
Eric, how can
your grandmother not like me?

12:55.554 --> 13:00.491
Ooh! Maybe I should wear my
Catholic school uniform around her more.

13:00.559 --> 13:02.584
People like me in that.

13:02.661 --> 13:05.255
Well, guys mostly.

13:05.330 --> 13:09.198
But, hey, give it a shot.
Grandmas have secrets too.

13:13.739 --> 13:16.435
Donna, Steven broke up with me.

13:16.508 --> 13:19.671
Oh.Jackie, I'm sorry.

13:19.745 --> 13:23.806
Hey, maybe he just wanted you to be able to
spend more time with your other boyfriend.

13:23.882 --> 13:26.442
( Together)
Shut up, Eric!

13:26.518 --> 13:30.215
Oh. It's you.

13:30.289 --> 13:33.747
Didn't know they let
slutballs in here.

13:33.825 --> 13:37.283
Well, I've seen you in here,
so I figured it was okay.

13:37.362 --> 13:39.887
Oh, you don't know it,
but you just burnt yourself.

13:39.965 --> 13:42.263
Oh, I know it.
The question is, do you?

13:44.703 --> 13:46.796
I just said I do.

13:46.872 --> 13:49.534
So do I, so you are too.

13:51.243 --> 13:54.178
Donna, you following this?

13:54.246 --> 13:58.080
Um, I think one of'em's
a slutball and one of'em knows it.

13:59.918 --> 14:02.682
I think what we need to do
is go talk about Michael.

14:02.754 --> 14:06.246
Fine. I'll try to use small words
so you can understand me.

14:07.659 --> 14:09.593
That's not gonna be good enough.

14:14.533 --> 14:18.060
- Hey, Grandma.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Sigurdson.

14:19.805 --> 14:22.365
Nice day, huh?

14:22.441 --> 14:27.208
No. It's raining,
and my arthritis is kicking up.

14:27.279 --> 14:30.271
What a coincidence.
Mine too.

14:30.349 --> 14:32.340
Boy, am I getting old.

14:33.719 --> 14:36.085
Not too old, you know.

14:36.154 --> 14:38.145
Whatever you are.

14:39.891 --> 14:43.827
Wow. Hey, Grandma,
Donna brought you some salsa.

14:43.895 --> 14:47.729
Yep, Donna makes the best darn
salsa outside of your beloved Arizona.

14:47.799 --> 14:51.599
It's a reflection of her long-time
love affair with the Southwest.

14:52.604 --> 14:54.538
Much like your own.

14:54.606 --> 14:56.597
Go, Grand Canyon!

14:58.276 --> 15:00.938
So, Eric, who are you
seeing these days?

15:01.012 --> 15:03.742
Okay.

15:03.815 --> 15:08.343
Okay, Grandma, you have got
to give Donna a chance.

15:08.420 --> 15:13.517
And I know you two will get along famously.
You have so much in common.

15:13.592 --> 15:17.153
Right. Like I love eating
dinner at 4:30 too.

15:19.264 --> 15:23.496
Look, Miss Sigurdson,
I love Eric with all my heart.

15:23.568 --> 15:27.299
And I know that when you give me a chance,
you'll see that we're great together.

15:27.372 --> 15:30.341
Well, that's very sweet.
And you're right.

15:30.409 --> 15:33.742
I'm sure you're the nicest girl
Eric's met so far.

15:39.251 --> 15:42.379
She is just so good at that.

15:42.521 --> 15:44.455
See?

15:52.964 --> 15:57.765
Isn't it better to be up and about
than stuck in your bed for a week?

15:59.004 --> 16:00.938
Well, this is better.

16:01.006 --> 16:04.567
Why did I let that woman get to me?
I'm gonna get out of this robe.

16:04.643 --> 16:07.237
And take a shower.
I mean, that's the spirit!

16:10.615 --> 16:13.015
Your mother is a nutbag!

16:13.084 --> 16:15.018
What did she do?

16:15.086 --> 16:18.351
That thing where she pretends to be nice,
but she's really insulting you.

16:18.423 --> 16:21.119
- Yes!
- Frigid witch!

16:24.362 --> 16:26.626
I'll get the bed ready.

16:27.632 --> 16:30.430
How could she not like me?

16:30.502 --> 16:32.436
How can she not like me?

16:32.504 --> 16:36.372
You know what? Maybe she just can't
handle strong, healthy women.

16:36.441 --> 16:38.375
And I am strong and healthy.

16:38.443 --> 16:41.344
( Quoting Lyric )

16:43.849 --> 16:48.013
- ( Quoting Ends )
- Yeah.

16:50.956 --> 16:54.517
- Well, I am not giving up on her.
- Oh, why are you worried?

16:54.593 --> 16:58.791
I'm the one who has to live the rest of my
life in the same family with this woman.

16:58.864 --> 17:01.958
Yeah, but so do I.

17:02.033 --> 17:05.332
In the sense that, um...

17:05.403 --> 17:08.031
we're all part of the human family.

17:12.277 --> 17:14.973
Steven, I have to
tell you something.

17:15.046 --> 17:19.311
Well, if it's ''get off my boyfriend,''
don't worry. I already heard it.

17:20.919 --> 17:25.288
No. I have to tell you,
you were right.

17:25.357 --> 17:28.155
When I said that,
it did mean something.

17:28.226 --> 17:30.956
And I thought it didn't,
because sometimes I just want things...

17:31.029 --> 17:32.963
because other people have them.

17:33.031 --> 17:37.695
Like once, I made my dad buy me a pet rat
because my cousin had one.

17:37.769 --> 17:42.331
But then the rat got so disgusting,
I made my kitty cat hunt it.

17:42.407 --> 17:45.672
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

17:45.744 --> 17:48.736
- Who's the rat? Am I the rat?
- No.

17:48.813 --> 17:50.804
No. Steven-

17:52.684 --> 17:55.551
Look. Okay, I spoke to Annette.

17:55.620 --> 17:57.747
And she made me
realize that, okay...

17:57.822 --> 18:01.053
maybe I do have some
leftover feelings for Michael.

18:01.126 --> 18:04.892
And then she said that if I wanted him,
I'd have to fight for him.

18:04.963 --> 18:08.922
But, Steven, I know in my heart
the only person I wanna fight for is you.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.094
Really? Oh, boy!

18:13.738 --> 18:16.298
You like Kelso, but you like me
a little bit more?

18:16.374 --> 18:19.104
What a bunch of crap!
You know what I think,Jackie?

18:19.177 --> 18:23.375
I think the only reason you're with me
in the first place was to get back at Kelso.

18:23.448 --> 18:25.382
Steven, how can you say that?

18:25.450 --> 18:28.385
Okay, fine. Maybe I do
have feelings for Michael.

18:28.453 --> 18:31.513
But what am I supposed to do?
He was my first boyfriend.

18:31.590 --> 18:34.184
And you know what?
You're gonna have to learn to deal with it.

18:34.259 --> 18:37.160
And if you can't and you're gonna have
to break up with me because of that...

18:37.228 --> 18:41.722
then I can't stop you, but I think it's
a real waste, because I love you.

18:49.140 --> 18:52.507
I'm not saying it back!

18:59.317 --> 19:02.309
I don't care.

19:02.387 --> 19:04.378
Damn it!

19:05.390 --> 19:07.381
( Sighs )

19:19.771 --> 19:22.239
So, are we gonna go
to the dance or what?

19:22.307 --> 19:24.775
Oh, Steven.

19:33.318 --> 19:36.981
Well, it looks like I'm
just in time for makeup sex.

19:39.324 --> 19:42.623
Don't mind me.
You'll barely hear me.

19:44.429 --> 19:47.762
If you prefer,
I can hide in the shower.

19:47.832 --> 19:50.699
- Fez, get out of here.
- Okay, here I go.

19:59.744 --> 20:02.076
( P.A.: Disco )

20:02.147 --> 20:05.275
Earlier today I mentioned that...

20:05.350 --> 20:08.649
I would like your balloons
to be my walkway of love.

20:09.821 --> 20:12.688
And you said, ''Okay.''

20:12.757 --> 20:16.591
Do you know what I meant? Because I don't
want to surprise you with this one.

20:16.661 --> 20:19.391
Well, I think you meant-

20:19.464 --> 20:21.398
That's it!

20:23.334 --> 20:26.895
- Hey, look who's back together.
- What the hell!

20:26.971 --> 20:29.201
Come on,Jackie.
Let's dance.

20:34.179 --> 20:37.945
How can she be with him
when she's so clearly not over me?

20:38.016 --> 20:40.985
I think the question is,
how can you be with me...

20:41.052 --> 20:43.247
when you're so clearly not over her?

20:43.321 --> 20:46.552
What, is this a riddle?
Start over.

20:46.624 --> 20:50.185
You're obviously
still in love with Jackie.

20:50.261 --> 20:52.229
I'm goin' back to California.

20:52.297 --> 20:56.859
Baby, no! I'll prove
that I'm over her.

20:56.935 --> 21:00.928
I'll bet you 50 bucks
that if we do it, I'll be into it.

21:01.005 --> 21:02.870
Good-bye, Michael.

21:02.941 --> 21:05.466
But you win either way!

21:25.597 --> 21:28.361
Oh, I feel so much better.
( Chuckles )

21:28.433 --> 21:31.698
I am a strong, healthy woman
who doesn't need to go to bed...

21:31.770 --> 21:34.830
every time some mean, old lady
gives her a cross look.

21:34.906 --> 21:38.467
- That's right.
- Good evening, Mother.

21:38.543 --> 21:41.068
- Going out to dinner.
- <i>Oh.</i>

21:41.146 --> 21:43.307
Is that what you're wearing?

21:45.550 --> 21:48.144
I'll be in bed.

21:49.305 --> 21:55.425
