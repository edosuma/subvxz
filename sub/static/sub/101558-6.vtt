01:29.541 --> 01:30.541
The post is here.

01:31.833 --> 01:33.208
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

[storyteller] <i>Lord Wingrave greatly</i>

[receptionist] Miss Clayton phoned.

02:27.125 --> 02:27.958
And?

02:28.041 --> 02:30.833
Just an update.
Wanted to report about the children.

02:30.916 --> 02:32.500
And how are the children?

02:32.583 --> 02:35.583
She says they're well,
but she's a bit concerned,

02:35.666 --> 02:39.041
and that she's happy to elaborate,
if you'd like to schedule a call.

02:39.666 --> 02:42.041
Says there's some things,

02:42.125 --> 02:43.958
nothing alarming she says, but…

02:44.458 --> 02:46.541
some things you may want to hear about.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.166
No need.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.875
I'm happy the children are well.

02:52.416 --> 02:53.833
Of course. [inhales deeply]

02:57.875 --> 02:59.166
Have a good weekend.

03:00.916 --> 03:01.916
[receptionist] Uh…

03:02.000 --> 03:02.833
Thank you.

[sniffs]

03:48.958 --> 03:51.458
Scotch or bourbon tonight?

04:00.625 --> 04:02.166
Scotch it is.

[Dominic] Charlotte!

05:32.583 --> 05:33.416
Charlotte!

05:34.916 --> 05:35.750
Too late?

05:35.833 --> 05:37.333
-[Henry] You're on time.
-I'm on time?

05:37.416 --> 05:40.000
-Yeah, she's close but not yet.
-Thank God for that.

05:40.083 --> 05:40.916
Charlotte, I'm here!

05:41.000 --> 05:43.583
I… I don't think she cares much
right now, to be honest.

05:44.916 --> 05:45.958
She's early.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.166
She's quite early.

05:47.250 --> 05:48.625
It happens, doesn't it?

05:48.708 --> 05:50.875
I'd never have left
if I'd thought she'd be this early.

05:50.958 --> 05:52.666
Well, you made it, you're fine.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.791
I'd never miss the birth
of my own daughter.

05:54.875 --> 05:57.041
[panting] I'd never.
Why not the hospital?

05:57.125 --> 05:58.791
It was faster
to have the doctor come here.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.666
This early,
you should take her to a hospital.

06:00.750 --> 06:03.916
A hospital is two hours away.
The doctor was 40 minutes away.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.833
-Miles?
-He's fine. He's asleep.

06:05.916 --> 06:06.750
Okay.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.166
-I'm here, darling.
-[Charlotte groaning]

06:09.708 --> 06:10.875
Here's my girl.

06:10.958 --> 06:11.791
My girls.

06:12.541 --> 06:13.708
How are my girls?

07:58.041 --> 08:00.500
[Jamie] Don't usually see you
this early in the a.m.

08:01.416 --> 08:02.250
Uh…

08:02.333 --> 08:04.250
Yeah, well, I-I knew… um…

08:04.750 --> 08:07.083
I know that y-you start early
on Thursdays.

08:08.250 --> 08:09.083
[Dani] So,

08:09.166 --> 08:11.208
I thought I'd bring you some coffee.

08:12.208 --> 08:13.583
You Yanks and your coffee.

08:14.333 --> 08:15.250
You might like it.

08:19.000 --> 08:19.833
Cheers.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.250
Cheers.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.833
-[spits]
-I'm not the best at coffee, either.

08:29.375 --> 08:30.500
-[chuckles]
-[Jamie] Ahem.

08:31.625 --> 08:32.833
How's your week been?

08:33.333 --> 08:34.583
It's been okay.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.250
Yeah, um…

08:39.583 --> 08:41.666
The kids have been
a little strange, lately.

08:42.291 --> 08:44.416
Everything's been a bit strange, really.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.500
And no Owen.

08:48.125 --> 08:49.166
No you.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.875
[Jamie] Mm. [clears throat]

08:52.375 --> 08:54.416
I seem to see less and less of Hannah.

08:55.375 --> 08:56.416
She just…

08:56.500 --> 08:57.916
goes out, I guess.

08:59.208 --> 09:00.375
By herself.

09:00.458 --> 09:04.250
Sometimes, I just turn around,
and-and she's gone.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Sometimes, people just need to be alone.

09:15.708 --> 09:17.416
Did you wake up just for this?

09:18.250 --> 09:19.125
No.

09:20.416 --> 09:22.125
You just waited for me to come back.

09:22.791 --> 09:25.333
I-I knew that you were coming back
today, but…

09:26.875 --> 09:28.875
no, no particular reason.

09:29.416 --> 09:30.500
Are the kids awake?

09:30.583 --> 09:32.875
Um, no. No, they're asleep.

09:32.958 --> 09:34.750
So, you just got up with the sun.

09:35.458 --> 09:36.541
And you're, uh…

09:36.625 --> 09:40.458
tiptoeing around the kitchen
making awful coffee by yourself,

09:41.166 --> 09:43.416
just to come say hi at six in the morning,

09:43.500 --> 09:44.750
for no particular reason?

09:47.416 --> 09:49.583
Poppins, you flirt.

09:51.041 --> 09:51.875
Fine.

09:52.541 --> 09:55.708
I-I… I don't like the way we left it.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.041
And how did we leave it?

09:59.708 --> 10:00.541
Wrong.

10:01.708 --> 10:02.875
And-And I wanted to…

10:03.541 --> 10:05.458
I wanted to start doing something right.

10:06.208 --> 10:08.125
So, I thought I'd start with coffee.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.083
Are you sure about that?

10:12.958 --> 10:15.000
Because every time
I think you might be sure,

10:15.583 --> 10:17.875
you've got this irritating habit
of jumping back,

10:17.958 --> 10:19.291
like you've just seen a scary bug.

10:20.375 --> 10:21.833
Maybe that's best, really.

10:22.375 --> 10:23.375
I like you.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.000
But I also like my life the way it is.

10:27.083 --> 10:28.750
Nice and boring.

10:28.833 --> 10:31.250
[scoffs]
Yeah, I-I wouldn't want to disrupt that.

10:32.375 --> 10:35.333
[in forced Cockney accent]
Gotta keep things proper borin',

10:35.833 --> 10:36.916

10:37.000 --> 10:37.875
[Jamie snickers]

10:41.916 --> 10:44.916
[in normal accent]
Look, there's-there's a pub in Bly, right?

10:46.291 --> 10:47.125
There is.

10:49.208 --> 10:50.708
Would you want to get a drink?

10:52.166 --> 10:53.208
Away from the house.

10:53.958 --> 10:55.333
Away from all this.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.750
That could be <i>kind </i>of boring, right?

11:00.833 --> 11:02.208
Could be dreadfully boring.

11:02.708 --> 11:05.416
Okay, so I could ask Hannah
to watch the kids one night.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.291
And you and me…

11:09.625 --> 11:11.208
could get a boring, old drink…

11:12.166 --> 11:13.500
in a boring, old pub…

11:14.625 --> 11:16.416
and see where that takes us.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.458
You know I live above that pub, right?

11:23.375 --> 11:25.083
I told you that already, didn't I?

11:26.250 --> 11:27.291
Got a little flat.

11:27.833 --> 11:30.125
Right above the boring, little pub.

11:34.125 --> 11:35.875
[eerie music playing]

11:36.375 --> 11:37.208
Flora?

11:38.458 --> 11:39.875
[eerie music plays]

11:44.500 --> 11:45.416
[Dani] Flora!

11:45.500 --> 11:46.750
Flora, Flora!

11:46.833 --> 11:48.125
Hey, hey.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.083
Hey.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.125
What are you doing?

11:53.208 --> 11:54.416
I don't feel good.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.541
How long have you been out here?

12:00.791 --> 12:02.166
I just woke up.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.333
I don't know.

12:05.833 --> 12:07.000

12:24.750 --> 12:25.583
[Flora] Hello?

12:29.083 --> 12:29.916
Miles?

12:31.458 --> 12:32.291
Is that you?

12:44.875 --> 12:45.708
[quiet creaking]

12:50.083 --> 12:50.916
[creak]

12:52.375 --> 12:53.208
Wait!

12:58.541 --> 12:59.416
Who are you?

13:03.833 --> 13:04.791
Did you hear me?

13:07.875 --> 13:08.875
I'm Flora.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.625
[ominous shrill sound]

13:13.708 --> 13:14.708
[Flora screams]

13:14.791 --> 13:16.625

-[unsettling music playing]

13:19.666 --> 13:20.500
Mummy!

13:21.958 --> 13:22.833
Mummy!

13:24.375 --> 13:25.250
What is it?

13:25.333 --> 13:27.333
There's someone in my room.
A little boy.

13:27.416 --> 13:29.000
Oh, Miles!

13:29.625 --> 13:31.583
-For God's sake.
-It's not Miles.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.875
It's not. It's…

13:37.333 --> 13:38.166
Uncle Henry?

13:39.166 --> 13:40.000
Oh.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.833
-Hello, Flora.
-[Charlotte chuckles awkwardly]

13:42.375 --> 13:43.583
What are you doing here?

13:44.541 --> 13:47.000
I didn't drive back
to the city last night.

13:47.083 --> 13:48.500
Uncle Henry slept over.

13:48.583 --> 13:49.916
In one of the guest rooms.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.583
And I was just saying good morning
just now.

13:52.666 --> 13:53.500
[Charlotte] Yes.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.458
And I-I just heard you say
there was someone in your room.

13:56.541 --> 13:58.791
Come! See, quickly!

14:08.916 --> 14:10.916
You see? No one there.

14:12.625 --> 14:13.541
Not now,

14:14.291 --> 14:15.125
but there was.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.083
There definitely was.

14:17.666 --> 14:19.541
And stop saying there wasn't!

14:19.625 --> 14:21.708
All right, all right. There was.

14:22.958 --> 14:24.583
There was a little boy, you say?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.166
Little, like me.

14:27.666 --> 14:30.166
Oh, surely no one is as little as you.

14:31.791 --> 14:32.833
[Charlotte chuckles]

14:33.458 --> 14:35.916
Well, if there is a little boy,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
and you're the only one who can see him,

14:38.625 --> 14:40.333
perhaps he'd like to be your friend.

14:41.791 --> 14:44.458
No, there's something wrong with him.

14:45.333 --> 14:46.958
His face isn't finished.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.958
-Oh, no.
-[Charlotte chuckles]

14:49.333 --> 14:51.166
He doesn't even have a mouth.

14:51.250 --> 14:54.375
Well, I should think
he would be a very good listener.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.958
And there's almost nothing
more important than that in a friend.

14:58.041 --> 14:59.291
[Charlotte] That's right.

14:59.375 --> 15:03.125
And if he <i>can</i> listen, perhaps he'd love
to hear some of your stories, Flora.

15:03.750 --> 15:06.500
But… how can he be my friend

15:06.583 --> 15:09.125
if… he can't tell me his name?

15:10.041 --> 15:12.375
Well, perhaps you could give him a name.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.791
You could give him
a whole story of his own.

15:14.875 --> 15:17.708
Uh, I had a friend
when I was your age, too.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.333
In this house, in fact.

15:19.791 --> 15:20.833
He was a soldier,

15:21.625 --> 15:23.250
and I was very afraid of him,

15:23.750 --> 15:25.291
until I gave him a story.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.375
Was he happy when you gave him one?

15:27.458 --> 15:28.625
Oh, he was.

15:29.416 --> 15:32.083
So, maybe I could do that.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.875
Give him a story.

15:33.958 --> 15:35.333
That's my sweet girl.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.500
When's Daddy coming home
from Scotland, Mummy?

15:49.083 --> 15:50.166
Uh…

15:50.250 --> 15:51.166
U-Um…

15:51.833 --> 15:53.583
Soon, my love.

15:53.666 --> 15:55.500
This is strange.

15:56.291 --> 15:57.166
It is?

15:58.041 --> 15:58.958
I think…

16:00.166 --> 16:01.000
because…

16:02.375 --> 16:05.875
Well, I suppose it's because I'm too old.

16:06.833 --> 16:07.666
Isn't it?

16:09.291 --> 16:11.166
Yes, I expect that's it.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.541
I feel like I should be littler.

16:14.083 --> 16:16.666
Well, you should be five years old,
in fact.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.416
You were five years old
when this happened.

16:19.875 --> 16:20.708
[Flora] So,

16:20.791 --> 16:22.541
why aren't I five years old?

16:23.958 --> 16:27.250
I'm not five years old,
I'm eight years old.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.166
Why is my age all wrong?

16:29.250 --> 16:30.791
You know why, don't you?

16:33.041 --> 16:34.875
Because this is a memory.

16:34.958 --> 16:36.250
That's right.

16:37.333 --> 16:40.041
[Flora] I've been tucked away again,
in another memory.

16:40.625 --> 16:41.458
You have.

16:41.541 --> 16:43.333
This is happening more and more,

16:43.416 --> 16:44.333
isn't it?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.208
It is.

16:46.291 --> 16:49.416
[Flora] I keep getting tucked away
in one memory or another,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.125
and, then, I start to realize it,

16:52.208 --> 16:54.750
and it'll be over as soon as I…

16:54.833 --> 16:55.666
Wake up.

16:56.458 --> 16:57.291
Wake up.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.083
Hey.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.666
Hey. [chuckles softly]

17:00.750 --> 17:01.791
Hey, you just…

17:02.833 --> 17:04.666
You just nodded off there.
[chuckles]

17:04.750 --> 17:05.791
You just, um…

17:06.333 --> 17:07.750
What-- What happened?

17:07.833 --> 17:09.250
[sighs] I don't know.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.250
I'm sorry.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.166
I'm having a bit of a moment.

17:15.708 --> 17:16.875
Oh, it's all right, we…

17:17.416 --> 17:20.291
We, uh…
we just wanna make sure that you're okay.

17:20.375 --> 17:21.416
What were you doing?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.375
[Dani] We were talking.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.291
We were, uh, talking about the walk.

17:26.375 --> 17:27.916
Your-Your walk last night.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.500
And, uh…

17:30.208 --> 17:31.333
And you just, um…

17:32.458 --> 17:35.583
Well, it-it looked like y-you fainted,

17:36.166 --> 17:37.291
but, uh…

17:37.375 --> 17:38.375
are you okay now?

17:39.750 --> 17:40.916
I'm quite tired.

17:42.416 --> 17:44.291
I'd like to go back to sleep.

17:44.958 --> 17:46.041
But to dream…

17:47.250 --> 17:48.166
not a memory.

17:49.250 --> 17:50.458
Dream, this time.

17:52.458 --> 17:53.416
[Dani] Okay.

17:58.416 --> 17:59.250
Okay.

17:59.791 --> 18:01.083
[knocking on door]

18:04.291 --> 18:05.833
It's Miss Clayton.

18:06.291 --> 18:07.916
Said Flora's been sleepwalking.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.791
-And she's all right? [sighs]
-I'm not sure.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.750
If she's all right, that's all.

18:12.833 --> 18:13.875
If she isn't?

18:15.375 --> 18:18.625
If she isn't, then why isn't she calling
a bloody doctor?

18:18.708 --> 18:19.625
[quietly] Yes.

18:23.541 --> 18:25.458
-[drops pen]
-[sighs]

18:25.541 --> 18:26.666
[clocks ticks quietly]

18:30.875 --> 18:31.708
[sighs quietly]

18:31.791 --> 18:33.333
[distant siren wailing]

18:36.666 --> 18:37.833
[line ringing]

18:39.916 --> 18:41.416
[Flora] <i>Flora residence.</i>

18:42.375 --> 18:43.708
Well, hello, Flora.

18:44.583 --> 18:45.583
It's Uncle Henry.

18:46.083 --> 18:46.916
<i>Hello.</i>

18:47.500 --> 18:48.916
How are you doing, darling?

18:49.500 --> 18:50.666
I-Is your mother…

18:51.708 --> 18:52.750
<i>What about Mummy?</i>

18:54.791 --> 18:56.583
Well, I mean to say, uh…

18:56.666 --> 18:58.666
have you seen that little boy again?

18:59.333 --> 19:01.750
<i>Oh, no, not yet.</i>

19:02.291 --> 19:03.916
Oh, well, that's fine, isn't it?

19:04.625 --> 19:06.708
Now, are you working on a story for him?

19:07.416 --> 19:08.250
<i>I'm trying.</i>

19:08.750 --> 19:11.375
<i>But Daddy says he's a type of mint.</i>

19:12.416 --> 19:13.541
I'm sorry?

19:13.625 --> 19:17.291
<i>He says he's a type of special mint.</i>
<i>And that's all.</i>

19:18.041 --> 19:20.541
<i>A fig mint, he says.</i>

19:20.625 --> 19:23.625
<i>-In my imagination.</i>
-[Henry laughing]

19:24.375 --> 19:28.000
Well, you-you tell your dad
even "fig mints" need a story.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.750
<i>Tell him yourself.</i>

19:30.250 --> 19:32.958
<i>Dad, Uncle Henry's on the phone!</i>

19:34.166 --> 19:35.208
What?

19:35.291 --> 19:36.416
<i>Hang on.</i>

19:36.500 --> 19:39.291
<i>He says fig mints need stories, too.</i>

19:39.375 --> 19:41.208
-[sighs]
-[Dominic] <i>Thanks, sweetheart.</i>

19:42.208 --> 19:43.125
What's this, then?

19:43.791 --> 19:46.083
Hi, you're, you're back.

19:46.166 --> 19:47.666
<i>I am. Just for a bit.</i>

19:47.750 --> 19:50.416
Flew in last night,
last flight out of Glasgow.

19:50.500 --> 19:53.458
Spur of the moment thing, but, uh…
But don't worry about the case.

19:53.541 --> 19:56.208
-<i>I'm heading back tomorrow.</i>
-Uh, well done.

19:56.916 --> 20:00.291
I-I'm sure the children
are beyond thrilled to see you.

20:01.375 --> 20:02.291
<i>How did you know?</i>

20:03.375 --> 20:04.291
Know what?

20:04.375 --> 20:05.791
That I was back.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.166
Or were you-- Why are you calling?

20:08.791 --> 20:09.708
I was…

20:10.458 --> 20:12.666
I was looking for you. I…

20:13.625 --> 20:16.833
I tried Glasgow,
and I couldn't find you, so…

20:18.333 --> 20:22.375
I thought Charlotte would know
if you'd swapped hotels.

20:22.458 --> 20:24.083
No, no, I'm still at the…

20:24.166 --> 20:26.291
Well, anyway, you found me.
What's happening?

20:26.375 --> 20:27.625
Well, I've…

20:29.500 --> 20:32.416
<i>Well, I've answered</i>
<i>my own question, actually.</i>

20:32.500 --> 20:34.958
In the time that we've been… talking,

20:35.041 --> 20:36.625
<i>I've sorted it out.</i>

20:37.333 --> 20:38.625
Oh, well.

20:38.708 --> 20:39.625
Well done.

20:40.625 --> 20:41.458
<i>Sure.</i>

20:43.166 --> 20:44.166
Safe travels.

20:48.125 --> 20:50.208
[footsteps receding]

20:52.791 --> 20:53.708
[Henry sighs]

20:57.916 --> 20:59.125
Fuck.

21:00.791 --> 21:02.125
[sighs heavily]

21:05.166 --> 21:06.208
[ominous music playing]

21:06.291 --> 21:08.500
Don't know who you're trying to hide from.

21:12.250 --> 21:13.375
Might as well come in.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.208
[alter ego] So…

21:22.750 --> 21:25.833
we decided on Scotch <i>and </i>bourbon tonight.

21:26.333 --> 21:29.208
[chuckles] And the '62, at that.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.625
Are you sure we can still afford it?

21:32.708 --> 21:34.583
After Peter robbed you blind.

21:34.666 --> 21:36.000
Hardly blind.

21:36.666 --> 21:37.958
What's a quarter mil?

21:38.458 --> 21:41.583
And Miles' money, after all, not yours.

21:41.666 --> 21:43.416
I replaced all of it as…

21:44.333 --> 21:45.625
You know this.

21:46.875 --> 21:49.958
Don't know why I bother
explaining myself to you.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.750
You know everything.

21:53.541 --> 21:54.375
Oh.

21:54.875 --> 21:56.833
She's likely asleep by now.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.875
You'd get the cook again,
or the housekeeper.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.625
Or that cute little American.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.291
The calls are spooking them.

22:06.375 --> 22:07.208
You know it.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.791
The Scholarship Society.

22:15.875 --> 22:18.750
[scoffs] Well, they should know better,
shouldn't they?

22:18.833 --> 22:21.625
[laughs]
They've had years to figure it out.

22:22.750 --> 22:24.625
The receptionist could handle this.

22:25.208 --> 22:28.291
This… and all his correspondence.

22:28.375 --> 22:30.000
I'm perfectly capable.

22:30.083 --> 22:33.375
She could send out a notice of death,
and stop the incoming mail.

22:33.458 --> 22:34.583
Could send a dozen.

22:35.041 --> 22:37.625
Could send a notice
every time something comes in

22:37.708 --> 22:39.458
without ever bothering you with it.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.416
You wouldn't even need to know it.

22:42.041 --> 22:43.666
I'm perfectly capable.

22:43.750 --> 22:44.666
Hm.

22:44.750 --> 22:47.791
You insist on handling it
so that no one does,

22:48.708 --> 22:52.458
because every time you send out
a notice of death,

22:52.541 --> 22:55.583
the world where you can pretend
your brother's still alive

22:55.666 --> 22:57.083
gets a little bit smaller.

22:57.166 --> 22:58.375
Doesn't it?

22:58.458 --> 23:00.500
I'm not pretending a fucking thing.

23:00.583 --> 23:03.750
Well, then take down the address
on this envelope,

23:03.833 --> 23:07.166
and draft a notice of death
for Dominic Wingrave,

23:07.250 --> 23:09.291
and put it in the post.

23:11.083 --> 23:13.416
[Henry sighs heavily]

23:16.291 --> 23:17.333
[drawer slides open]

23:19.750 --> 23:20.708
[drawer slams shut]

23:22.333 --> 23:23.333
[chuckling]

23:29.041 --> 23:29.875
[sighs]

23:31.375 --> 23:33.375
-[insects chirping]
-[footsteps creaking]

23:39.250 --> 23:40.083
How is she?

23:41.666 --> 23:42.875
She slept all day.

23:42.958 --> 23:43.791
[Hannah] Hm.

23:43.875 --> 23:46.375
[sighs] No fever, though. I keep checking.

23:47.375 --> 23:48.916
Poor thing must be exhausted.

23:50.416 --> 23:52.333
[Dani] We-We missed you this afternoon.

23:52.416 --> 23:53.750
Where did you run off to?

23:53.833 --> 23:54.750
[Hannah] Oh, um…

23:54.833 --> 23:55.666
I'm not…

23:56.916 --> 23:58.958
Well, I suppose I <i>was</i> around.

23:59.708 --> 24:03.875
[scoffs] God, what does that say about me?
I can… can hardly remember this afternoon.

24:03.958 --> 24:06.083
[Dani] If she's the same tomorrow,
I'll call the doctor.

24:06.166 --> 24:09.166
-Yes. Yes, that sounds about right.
-I called Henry, but…

24:10.166 --> 24:11.166
he didn't call back.

24:11.875 --> 24:14.708
I… don't understand. I mean…

24:15.833 --> 24:16.833
how could a person…

24:17.958 --> 24:19.541
They're his only family.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.416
Henry's not exactly himself anymore.

24:24.791 --> 24:25.750
Not really, I mean…

24:26.750 --> 24:28.375
he hasn't been for a long time.

24:28.958 --> 24:32.333
[sighs] Ever since Charlotte and Dominic
went on that blasted trip.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.500
Well, I suppose none of them came back.

24:35.583 --> 24:37.458
I mean, Charlotte and Dominic,
obviously, but…

24:38.208 --> 24:39.875
neither did Henry, if I'm honest.

24:41.291 --> 24:42.125
Oh.

24:42.708 --> 24:44.208
All three of them just…

24:44.291 --> 24:45.166
[splutters]

24:46.083 --> 24:46.916
gone.

24:49.750 --> 24:50.750
Are you coming down?

24:52.291 --> 24:53.125
In a bit.

24:54.500 --> 24:55.333
All righty.

25:16.375 --> 25:18.375
[quiet, unsettling music playing]

25:36.750 --> 25:37.583
[Owen] <i>We can go…</i>

25:37.666 --> 25:40.166
Like, we can go this weekend.
It's Patrick Swayze, come on.

25:40.250 --> 25:42.666
-Yeah, in concert.
-[Hannah muttering indistinctly]

25:43.416 --> 25:44.916
You're still here?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.958
-Oh, yes.
-Oh, yeah, had to wash up.

25:47.041 --> 25:48.875
Besides, I was asked to stay behind.

25:48.958 --> 25:49.791
[Dani scoffs]

25:50.291 --> 25:52.583
Now, who would ask you to do that?

25:53.833 --> 25:54.916
[Owen clears throat]

25:56.750 --> 25:58.375
[Jamie] Don't touch that.

25:58.458 --> 25:59.750
You'll just desecrate it.

25:59.833 --> 26:02.958
[laughs] Hey, I, uh…
I thought you left a while ago.

26:03.041 --> 26:06.166
Made it halfway home,
and I thought, "Rough day.

26:07.625 --> 26:09.791
Maybe Poppins
might fancy a little boredom."

26:10.791 --> 26:11.958
What do you say?

26:12.041 --> 26:14.541
-The kids, I--
-Already taken care of.

26:14.625 --> 26:16.875
[Hannah] I've got things handled here.
You, uh…

26:16.958 --> 26:18.166
You go and enjoy yourselves.

26:18.250 --> 26:20.583
-Uh, <i>we </i>have things handled here.
-Yes.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.166
Any nightmares, bogeymen,
or monsters under the bed

26:23.250 --> 26:24.916
will be dealt with swiftly and fairly,

26:26.041 --> 26:27.416
in an impartial court.

26:27.500 --> 26:28.625
[Dani laughs]

26:28.708 --> 26:29.541
Come on.

26:34.333 --> 26:36.708
-[rain pattering]
-[animal howls]

26:36.791 --> 26:37.666
[Dani] Where, uh…

26:38.541 --> 26:39.666
Where are we going?

26:41.958 --> 26:44.208
Are you taking me out here to kill me?

26:45.125 --> 26:46.875
[Jamie] Keep talking, I just might.

26:50.083 --> 26:51.166
So, uh…

26:51.916 --> 26:55.166
there's not many secret spots,
even on grounds this big.

26:56.583 --> 26:59.791
-But this one… special.
-[Dani] Wow, that's beautiful.

27:00.583 --> 27:02.166
-You planted that?
-Yeah.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.208
It's a moonflower.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.916
Bloody hard to grow in England.

27:08.541 --> 27:09.750
[Jamie clears throat]

27:09.833 --> 27:10.708
Yeah, but…

27:13.208 --> 27:14.041
worth it.

27:15.125 --> 27:16.208
[Jamie] Is it?

27:18.000 --> 27:18.833
Isn't it?

27:21.125 --> 27:23.375
This plant only blooms two months a year.

27:23.458 --> 27:24.375
And only at night.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.916
Each bud, only once.

27:28.333 --> 27:30.333
These flowers will be dead by morning,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.083
and tomorrow night,
new buds will bloom, and then they'll die.

27:35.458 --> 27:37.791
In three weeks,
this entire plant will be dead.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
And in the spring, I'll have to plant
a whole new moonflower.

27:45.750 --> 27:48.500
That's a lot of work
for a flower that only blooms once.

27:49.750 --> 27:51.583
That's what people feel like to me.

27:53.166 --> 27:54.291
Exhaustive effort.

27:55.458 --> 27:56.833
Very little to show for it.

27:59.625 --> 28:00.458
All of them?

28:01.750 --> 28:02.708
All of them.

28:03.916 --> 28:04.833
Even you.

28:06.791 --> 28:07.625
Even me.

28:09.541 --> 28:10.375
Especially me.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.375
So, I figured I'd save you some effort.

28:17.583 --> 28:19.583
[night animals calling distantly]

28:23.625 --> 28:24.833
[Jamie] Skip to the end.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.083
Take a shot.

28:27.791 --> 28:28.625
Why not?

28:30.583 --> 28:31.791
So, here goes, okay?

28:33.666 --> 28:34.541
[Dani] Mm-hm.

28:37.916 --> 28:38.750
Okay.

28:39.666 --> 28:41.875
[emotional music playing]

28:41.958 --> 28:42.875
Mum was Louise.

28:43.500 --> 28:44.458
Dad was Dennis.

28:45.166 --> 28:47.125
Dennis met Louise when she was 18.

28:47.958 --> 28:48.791
He was 24.

28:49.916 --> 28:52.833
Total surprise, a year later,
my brother Denny.

28:53.666 --> 28:56.416
And me, less of a surprise, I guess.

28:57.875 --> 28:59.583
Dad starts working in a coal mine.

29:00.125 --> 29:01.250
It's, uh, more money.

29:01.916 --> 29:02.875
Slightly more,

29:03.458 --> 29:07.375
but he's barely home now,
and Louise, well…

29:08.083 --> 29:11.541
Louise is home with the kids,
but she's basically a kid herself.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.833
A kid with two kids,
and a husband 600 meters down.

29:15.916 --> 29:17.583
So, she does what kids do.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.333
She plays.

29:21.125 --> 29:25.083
So, Dad's underground,
and Mum's under some bloke, and…

29:25.875 --> 29:27.291
the thing about a coal mine…

29:28.875 --> 29:31.291
Well, the thing I think about most
now I'm older…

29:34.208 --> 29:35.333
No plants down there.

29:37.000 --> 29:37.833
No life at all.

29:39.541 --> 29:40.541
See, these men…

29:41.291 --> 29:46.500
We send them down into this dark mess,
digging for something dead.

29:47.041 --> 29:50.541
So… dead that it's now lumps
of dead things,

29:50.625 --> 29:54.541
so old and lifeless
that they will literally burn,

29:54.625 --> 29:55.833
and that was his life.

29:56.958 --> 29:59.291
While she did
whatever she could to feel alive.

30:00.625 --> 30:01.750
All that death,

30:01.833 --> 30:05.791
that dark, powdery death
is all over his face,

30:06.625 --> 30:09.333
his hands, his fucking lungs,
when he comes up.

30:11.250 --> 30:14.291
There's not a leaf, not a branch,
not a flower in his world,

30:14.375 --> 30:16.583
and when he finally
climbs out of that grave,

30:17.583 --> 30:19.833
finally climbs back
to the land of the living…

30:22.458 --> 30:23.666
they laugh at him.

30:24.500 --> 30:28.250
They laugh because the whole town knows
that the new baby,

30:28.750 --> 30:31.208
my little brother Mikey, isn't his.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.833
So, Dennis buries his head in the soot,

30:37.375 --> 30:40.541
and they… [chuckles]
…praise him for his loyalty,

30:41.125 --> 30:42.833
while they mock him for a cuckold.

30:43.458 --> 30:44.833
Louise, on the other hand,

30:45.333 --> 30:48.416
call a spade a spade,
and they call my mum a whore.

30:51.166 --> 30:52.541
Call the daughter one, too,

30:53.458 --> 30:55.875
bully her at school, on the streets.

30:55.958 --> 30:57.208
Even makes its way home.

30:57.958 --> 30:59.208
Little Denny piles on,

30:59.916 --> 31:03.500
tries to save his own skin
by blaming all the females in the family,

31:03.583 --> 31:06.416
and in '67, Louise bolts.

31:07.583 --> 31:08.416
She splits,

31:09.416 --> 31:11.583
and I come home from school to find Mikey…

31:12.541 --> 31:13.375
alone…

31:14.708 --> 31:16.208
screaming his little head off.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.083
He's still a baby,

31:18.583 --> 31:20.791
and he doesn't understand
what he's done wrong.

31:24.458 --> 31:25.875
I try and take care of him.

31:28.333 --> 31:29.291
But I'm just a kid.

31:30.250 --> 31:31.458
Kids can't raise kids.

31:32.625 --> 31:33.625
I forget things.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.958
Like watching over a pot when it boils.

31:44.291 --> 31:45.916
So, one day there's an accident.

31:47.291 --> 31:49.583
Social Services gets involved,
and we're split up.

31:50.625 --> 31:51.750
Dad did his best.

31:52.333 --> 31:55.250
He spent so long underground, didn't know
what to do with a kid, let alone…

31:56.541 --> 31:57.500
three kids.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.083
So, he disappeared into the dirt.

32:02.583 --> 32:04.083
Then, it was foster care.

32:04.708 --> 32:07.750
Just a bunch of stale, perverted men

32:08.250 --> 32:09.458
with bitter wives,

32:09.958 --> 32:12.916
hoping to make a few quid
by taking care of the local trash.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.250
I left for London pretty soon after that.

32:17.291 --> 32:19.541
[sniffs] Got myself
into all sorts of trouble there.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.333
Wound up serving a couple of years.

32:24.416 --> 32:26.083
And it's there I start gardening.

32:26.166 --> 32:28.333
Busy work for idle hands.

32:30.083 --> 32:31.208
But I fucking love it.

32:32.666 --> 32:33.500
Love it.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.041
And it's so clear then…

32:38.041 --> 32:39.125
how <i>people…</i>

32:39.791 --> 32:40.666
aren't worth it.

32:42.458 --> 32:43.416
But plants…

32:46.208 --> 32:47.208
you pour your love,

32:47.791 --> 32:48.666
and your effort,

32:49.333 --> 32:50.916
and your nourishment into them…

32:52.958 --> 32:54.416
and you see where it goes.

32:55.583 --> 32:56.708
You watch them grow,

32:57.291 --> 32:58.458
and it all makes sense.

33:03.208 --> 33:04.208
So, yeah.

33:04.291 --> 33:05.166
[scoffs]

33:06.083 --> 33:07.500
Everyone is exhaustive.

33:08.791 --> 33:09.875
Even the best ones.

33:12.708 --> 33:13.750
But sometimes…

33:14.583 --> 33:16.666
once in a blue goddamned moon, I guess…

33:17.833 --> 33:18.750
someone…

33:19.875 --> 33:22.500
like this moonflower,
just might be worth the effort.

33:27.666 --> 33:29.250
Look, I know you're struggling.

33:30.750 --> 33:31.583
I see it.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.083
I know you're carrying this guilt around,

33:35.583 --> 33:38.958
but I also know that you don't decide
who lives and who doesn't.

33:39.958 --> 33:41.416
I'm sorry, Dani, but you don't.

33:42.666 --> 33:43.750
Humans are organic.

33:45.875 --> 33:46.791
It's a fact.

33:47.541 --> 33:48.500
We're meant to die.

33:49.708 --> 33:50.541
It's natural…

33:51.291 --> 33:52.125
beautiful.

33:54.625 --> 33:57.500
And it all breaks down and rises back up,

33:58.000 --> 33:59.125
and breaks down again,

33:59.208 --> 34:01.875
and every living thing
grows out of every dying thing.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.625
We leave more life behind us
to take our place.

34:06.916 --> 34:10.416
That life refreshes and recycles,

34:10.500 --> 34:11.916
and on and on it goes.

34:12.541 --> 34:14.125
And that is so much better

34:14.666 --> 34:16.916
than that life getting crushed,

34:17.833 --> 34:18.958
deep down in the dirt,

34:20.125 --> 34:22.958
into a rock that will burn
if it's old enough.

34:23.041 --> 34:27.166
So much better to see the leafling…
and flower.

34:29.958 --> 34:32.166
We leave more life behind
to take our place.

34:34.916 --> 34:36.041
Like this moonflower.

34:38.250 --> 34:42.333
It's where all its beauty lies, you know.
In the mortality of the thing.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.083
[emotional music continues]

34:48.583 --> 34:49.416
[Dani sighs]

34:58.541 --> 34:59.666
[Dani pants softly]

35:17.250 --> 35:19.250
[clock ticking quietly]

35:32.000 --> 35:32.833
Oh, dear.

35:35.416 --> 35:37.416
What are we going to do about this?

35:40.458 --> 35:41.625
I don't know.

35:44.541 --> 35:45.958
I truly don't know.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
[unsettling music playing]

36:06.083 --> 36:07.583
[soft growl]

36:11.500 --> 36:12.708
[Peter grunts]

36:14.083 --> 36:15.500
Is that all of it?

36:15.583 --> 36:18.000
-One more piece in the car.
-Okay, I'll grab it.

36:24.083 --> 36:25.208
[Charlotte gasps]

36:25.291 --> 36:27.250
Oh, my God!

36:27.833 --> 36:29.166
What have you done?

36:29.250 --> 36:32.000
I found a gentleman in Sussex
who makes these.

36:32.541 --> 36:34.166
It's, well…

36:34.250 --> 36:36.750
-It's close enough, I suppose.
-[Charlotte scoffs]

36:36.833 --> 36:38.791
Couldn't match it exactly, obviously.

36:39.458 --> 36:42.916
Oh, she's going to lose her mind.
[gasps]

36:43.000 --> 36:44.666
I'm sorry I won't make the party.

36:45.333 --> 36:46.958
Hopefully, this smooths it over.

36:47.041 --> 36:49.208
Oh, she's six.
She'll only notice the presents.

36:49.291 --> 36:50.125
[Henry chuckles]

36:51.875 --> 36:52.708
Not here.

36:54.958 --> 36:55.916
[Henry] Hm.

36:56.791 --> 36:59.541
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Henry] I'll get the last of it.

36:59.625 --> 37:02.583
Uh, perhaps we could hide this
in the study until the party.

37:04.958 --> 37:06.166
[Charlotte] Sounds good.

37:06.250 --> 37:08.375
Darling, look what your brother's brought.

37:09.000 --> 37:09.916
It's terrific.

37:11.416 --> 37:14.125
I'm sorry I can't make the birthday party.
You know how it is.

37:14.208 --> 37:17.458
-I'll call you when I get to Berlin.
-Sounds perfect.

37:22.416 --> 37:23.708
[door opens]

37:26.208 --> 37:27.666
[door creaks shut]

37:30.500 --> 37:32.041
[somber music playing]

37:44.083 --> 37:46.083
[rain pattering]

37:51.291 --> 37:52.416
[footsteps descending]

37:58.708 --> 38:00.500
[Charlotte gasps, laughs nervously]

38:01.125 --> 38:02.083
Oh, my God!

38:03.416 --> 38:04.250
What…

38:04.583 --> 38:07.375
Whatever are you doing here
just sitting in the dark?

38:08.041 --> 38:10.666
I just wanted something small
before going to sleep.

38:11.541 --> 38:14.625
Extra energy.
It's going to be a blitz in the morning.

38:14.708 --> 38:17.041
All those extra children running around.

38:17.666 --> 38:20.208
You should get some rest as well.
Are you coming to bed?

38:24.416 --> 38:25.708
[Dominic] Flora's birthday…

38:27.416 --> 38:28.416
got me thinking…

38:30.791 --> 38:32.375
what a strange night that was.

38:34.458 --> 38:35.416
[Charlotte] Was it?

38:37.458 --> 38:38.750
I don't remember much.

38:39.875 --> 38:41.125
Beauty of childbirth.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.500
We're supposed to forget, they say.

38:45.541 --> 38:47.208
A chemical in the brain, in fact.

38:48.708 --> 38:50.833
It's the only way
we'd ever have another one.

38:52.291 --> 38:53.916
She was so early.

39:00.583 --> 39:01.458
She was.

39:03.666 --> 39:04.500
Right.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.750
And I was so surprised.

39:07.666 --> 39:09.000
But for a baby that early…

39:10.125 --> 39:12.541
she wasn't nearly as small as I expected.

39:35.208 --> 39:36.541
Math didn't work, did it?

39:40.041 --> 39:41.458
I don't know what you mean.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.666
I mean, that if she wasn't early,

39:46.291 --> 39:48.375
if she was actually right on time,

39:48.458 --> 39:49.666
that math wouldn't work.

39:50.708 --> 39:52.708
She kind of had to be early, didn't she?

39:54.166 --> 39:56.625
Or else it would mean
she was conceived in August.

39:58.625 --> 39:59.791
While I was in Russia.

40:02.500 --> 40:03.541
Six years.

40:06.041 --> 40:08.208
Took me six years to do the math.

40:10.416 --> 40:12.125
I suppose I didn't want to, did I?

40:16.833 --> 40:19.041
I was gone an awful lot, wasn't I?

40:23.375 --> 40:24.208
Lonely…

40:25.750 --> 40:26.916
a house this size…

40:28.458 --> 40:29.541
just you and Miles.

40:31.750 --> 40:32.583
Lonely.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.416
Do you love him?

40:43.791 --> 40:44.833
[sighs]

40:50.250 --> 40:51.083
[sniffles]

41:04.666 --> 41:06.333
[storyteller]
<i>The au pair could not remember</i>

41:06.416 --> 41:08.375
<i>the last time she'd slept this well.</i>

41:09.166 --> 41:11.541
<i>And she thought perhaps she never had.</i>

41:16.500 --> 41:18.500
[quiet, unsettling sound]

41:22.583 --> 41:24.000
[Dani sighs]

41:42.791 --> 41:44.166
[unsettling music playing]

41:44.250 --> 41:45.083
[Dani] Flora!

41:46.875 --> 41:49.041
Flora! Flora, what are you doing?

41:51.041 --> 41:51.875
Where am I?

41:52.458 --> 41:55.625
What's happening? Are you okay?
Were you sleepwalking again?

41:55.708 --> 41:56.541
I don't…

41:57.458 --> 41:58.291
I don't know.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.958
I think I was tucked away again.

42:02.333 --> 42:04.041
Okay, come on. Let's go inside.

42:04.750 --> 42:06.208
Why does this keep happening?

42:11.125 --> 42:13.000
[ominous music playing]

42:19.500 --> 42:20.750
[music fades to silence]

42:21.333 --> 42:22.250
[sniffles]

42:22.750 --> 42:24.958
I'm terribly sorry for the trouble.

42:25.583 --> 42:28.625
I was just going on a walk.
I didn't mean to alarm you.

42:29.791 --> 42:33.750
Let's get some breakfast, shall we?
I'm positively famished.

42:34.750 --> 42:35.583
[Dani chuckles]

[clears throat]

42:51.041 --> 42:52.208
[clears throat louder]

42:53.458 --> 42:54.625
I'm sorry to interrupt.

42:55.208 --> 42:57.000
Miss Clayton called, again.

42:57.750 --> 43:00.166
-I think maybe you should--
-Is anyone hurt?

43:00.250 --> 43:01.625
Do they need an ambulance?

43:02.416 --> 43:04.416
No, I don't think it's that simple.

43:04.500 --> 43:05.958
Jesus, I told you!

43:06.458 --> 43:08.833
[yells] I'm unavailable
unless someone is hurt!

43:13.083 --> 43:14.208
[Henry sighs heavily]

43:16.250 --> 43:17.166
[sighs]

43:18.666 --> 43:20.250
Goddamn it.

43:21.666 --> 43:22.541
Fine!

43:24.166 --> 43:25.083
[exhales]

43:25.916 --> 43:26.750
Fine.

43:27.666 --> 43:29.083
Get her back on the phone.

43:29.166 --> 43:31.166
[unsettling music playing]

43:32.083 --> 43:34.708
-[men speaking indistinctly]
-[objects shuffling]

43:35.708 --> 43:36.541
[Henry] Hey.

43:37.375 --> 43:38.958
What's all this, then?

43:39.041 --> 43:40.791
Just put those in the car, will you?

43:42.541 --> 43:44.958
You keep the office, is what this is.

43:45.708 --> 43:47.125
What are you talking about?

43:47.208 --> 43:49.833
I don't want to see any of this,
ever again.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.041
How stupid you must have thought of me.

43:54.125 --> 43:55.250
How fucking stupid.

43:56.375 --> 43:59.333
-I-I don't--
-Babies rarely adhere to a schedule, Dom.

44:00.791 --> 44:01.625
But listen,

44:02.416 --> 44:04.000
and this is the important part.

44:05.250 --> 44:06.458
She's my daughter.

44:07.500 --> 44:08.958
In every way that matters.

44:10.041 --> 44:11.291
When she skins her knee,

44:12.000 --> 44:13.541
calls out with a nightmare…

44:14.500 --> 44:15.333
it's me.

44:16.583 --> 44:19.208
First time some asshole
breaks her heart…

44:20.375 --> 44:21.833
I'll be there to console her.

44:23.541 --> 44:26.875
And when she asks her father
to walk her down the aisle…

44:29.291 --> 44:30.791
me, not you.

44:32.166 --> 44:33.333
Do you understand me?

44:34.541 --> 44:35.541
She didn't tell you?

44:36.958 --> 44:37.916
Well, look at that.

44:38.541 --> 44:40.458
I get to be here when the penny drops.

44:42.458 --> 44:43.500
I've been thinking.

44:44.833 --> 44:47.250
I've been thinking
about what the right word must be.

44:47.916 --> 44:49.916
And I keep getting stuck on "banished."

44:50.666 --> 44:51.791
It's close.

44:51.875 --> 44:52.708
It has teeth.

44:53.375 --> 44:54.500
But not nearly enough.

44:57.375 --> 44:58.458
And it'll do for now.

45:00.416 --> 45:02.250
You're banished, little brother.

45:03.791 --> 45:05.416
You're banished from my house.

45:06.291 --> 45:09.125
You're banished from my wife, my children.

45:10.291 --> 45:11.125
Banished.

45:12.916 --> 45:14.583
You don't have a brother anymore.

45:16.041 --> 45:16.916
Or a niece.

45:17.750 --> 45:18.583
Or a nephew.

45:20.166 --> 45:21.000
Nobody.

45:22.416 --> 45:23.333
Just yourself.

45:24.541 --> 45:25.750
And yourself, Henry…

45:27.833 --> 45:29.000
your real self…

45:31.583 --> 45:32.833
he's an evil shit.

45:35.250 --> 45:37.500
A grotesque little demon, isn't he?

45:40.708 --> 45:41.666
I pity you.

45:43.750 --> 45:45.416
'Cause you have to live with him.

45:47.958 --> 45:49.541
You have to live with yourself.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.666
And he's a shit, grinning,
fucking monster.

45:55.666 --> 45:56.666
Isn't he?

46:08.041 --> 46:08.875
[door slams]

46:16.125 --> 46:18.875
-[Flora] How far away is India?
-[Charlotte chuckles]

46:18.958 --> 46:22.250
It's further than "I'll miss you,"
but closer than "goodbye."

46:22.875 --> 46:25.500
I know what you're thinking,
but you shouldn't worry.

46:25.583 --> 46:28.416
It's going to be fine.
It's just a few weeks, my darling.

46:29.625 --> 46:31.041
[Flora] Can I come with you?

46:31.583 --> 46:34.583
A couple of weeks is a terribly long time,

46:35.083 --> 46:38.750
and I don't want to be here all alone
with Miles and Mrs. Grose.

46:41.333 --> 46:42.166
Hm.

46:46.750 --> 46:48.416
Ah. Here we are.

46:49.833 --> 46:52.291
This is called a talisman.

46:53.166 --> 46:54.250
I used to make them.

46:54.875 --> 46:57.333
Well, sometimes I still do. Old habits.

46:58.625 --> 47:00.791
I've made them
since I was your age, really.

47:00.875 --> 47:02.083
[Flora] What does it do?

47:02.166 --> 47:04.875
Well, it protects people,
and it keeps them happy.

47:08.458 --> 47:10.041
[sighs] It's happening again…

47:11.083 --> 47:11.916
isn't it?

47:12.666 --> 47:13.500
What?

47:14.750 --> 47:16.041
I'm not really here.

47:17.083 --> 47:18.250
I'm too old.

47:19.583 --> 47:20.666
It's like…

47:20.750 --> 47:22.250
the math doesn't work.

47:22.333 --> 47:23.500
That's right.

47:25.291 --> 47:28.000
I'm tucked away again in another memory.

47:29.541 --> 47:30.625
Tucked away safe.

47:33.916 --> 47:35.125
I miss you, Mummy.

47:36.958 --> 47:38.375
[Charlotte whispering] Oh…

47:39.000 --> 47:39.833
My darling.

47:42.833 --> 47:44.875
[in normal voice]
You should probably wake up now.

47:44.958 --> 47:46.958
[ominous music playing]

47:49.375 --> 47:50.208
[eerie swish]

48:01.708 --> 48:04.166
-[Owen] Remember these? Was in the spring.
-[Dani] You remember.

48:06.333 --> 48:07.833
[Dani and Owen laugh]

48:07.916 --> 48:09.125
How can you have two helpings?

48:09.208 --> 48:10.708
-[all chuckling]
-Look at him go.

48:12.208 --> 48:14.208
[Flora] You've… You've…

48:15.291 --> 48:16.541
What are you doing?

48:16.625 --> 48:17.458
[Dani] Flora!

48:17.541 --> 48:18.750
Hey!

48:19.083 --> 48:21.458
You're eating dinner without me.

48:21.541 --> 48:22.750
W-What?

48:23.250 --> 48:25.916
-Wh-- Flora, what?
-You already ate, in your room.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.708
-Owen made you soup.
-It was some of my best work.

48:29.541 --> 48:30.875
I don't remember that.

48:31.625 --> 48:33.375
Told you she wasn't herself.

48:33.458 --> 48:34.458
She seems fine.

48:35.708 --> 48:36.666
But weird.

48:37.166 --> 48:38.500
I don't like this game.

48:39.791 --> 48:40.625
It's okay.

48:40.708 --> 48:41.750
I don't like it!

48:41.833 --> 48:43.500
-[phone rings]
-[Dani] Probably your uncle.

48:43.583 --> 48:46.375
Everything's gonna be okay, Flora.
Don't-Don't worry.

48:46.458 --> 48:47.291
Hello?

48:48.458 --> 48:49.291
Hello?

48:51.333 --> 48:52.166
<i>Hello?</i>

48:54.208 --> 48:56.375
<i>-It's another freaking prank call.</i>
-[line disconnects]

48:58.291 --> 48:59.125
[sighs]

48:59.208 --> 49:02.416
[alter ego] Do you <i>really</i> think
she'll answer one of these times?

49:03.208 --> 49:04.041
[scoffs]

49:04.125 --> 49:05.750
It's getting sad.

49:06.916 --> 49:07.750
[phone hangs up]

49:07.833 --> 49:10.041
I don't imagine
there's much in it for you.

49:10.125 --> 49:13.291
One in ten times you call,
she might answer.

49:14.250 --> 49:17.166
You might hear her say,
"Flora residence."

49:18.083 --> 49:18.958
Unlikely.

49:19.041 --> 49:19.916
[snickers]

49:20.625 --> 49:21.916
In the meantime…

49:22.000 --> 49:24.875
[laughing] …they think you're some pervert

49:24.958 --> 49:26.750
breathing into the phone.

49:26.833 --> 49:27.875
Just a crank.

49:28.541 --> 49:30.208
Pathetic, really.

49:30.708 --> 49:31.666
[knocking on door]

49:33.208 --> 49:34.666
Here we are again.

49:35.375 --> 49:39.000
Well, it's not real,
but you probably should get it anyway.

49:43.916 --> 49:45.083
[footsteps approaching]

49:49.583 --> 49:50.458
[sighs]

49:51.000 --> 49:52.291
I'm sorry to come by.

49:53.750 --> 49:54.583
Uh…

49:55.083 --> 49:56.500
Well, I-I was nearby, and…

49:58.125 --> 49:58.958
[sighs]

49:59.458 --> 50:00.708
I wasn't nearby.

50:02.083 --> 50:04.250
I made up a story. I don't have long.

50:08.875 --> 50:10.250
What are you doing in here?

50:11.000 --> 50:11.875
Oh, I was…

50:13.958 --> 50:14.833
[sighs]

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I don't rightly know. [laughs]

50:24.000 --> 50:24.875
I'm sorry.

50:27.458 --> 50:28.583
Flora.

50:28.666 --> 50:29.916
I'm so sorry.

50:30.625 --> 50:32.041
I should have told you.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.750
I should have done
a lot of things differently.

50:38.333 --> 50:39.500
We're leaving tonight.

50:40.750 --> 50:41.708
India.

50:43.833 --> 50:45.041
For a few weeks.

50:45.125 --> 50:46.416
Retracing our honeymoon.

50:48.791 --> 50:49.666
I see.

50:52.666 --> 50:53.833
I wanted to say goodbye.

50:53.916 --> 50:55.291
-Charlotte.
-I mean it.

50:56.833 --> 50:58.291
I'm going to make this work.

50:59.583 --> 51:01.333
My husband, my family.

51:02.833 --> 51:04.291
I needed you to hear it from me…

51:05.208 --> 51:06.666
why I'm going on this trip.

51:09.291 --> 51:10.458
I can fix it.

51:14.791 --> 51:16.833
But I couldn't leave without…

51:18.458 --> 51:19.916
I love you, Charlotte.

51:26.125 --> 51:26.958
I know.

51:31.833 --> 51:34.000
[crying]
There's a lot more to it than love.

51:34.875 --> 51:36.166
A lot more to it.

51:52.333 --> 51:55.416
[Charlotte sniffles, breathes heavily]

52:08.541 --> 52:10.083
[footsteps receding]

52:18.166 --> 52:20.166
[unsettling, ethereal music playing]

52:28.375 --> 52:30.083
[alter ego]
Jumping ahead, if you don't mind,

52:30.166 --> 52:32.041
to my favorite part.

52:32.125 --> 52:33.541
No, please.

52:34.083 --> 52:36.458
That hurts. That really hurts.

52:37.041 --> 52:38.250
I want to see it again.

52:38.333 --> 52:40.666
-No.
-The night we met.

52:40.750 --> 52:42.083
[phone rings]

52:42.666 --> 52:44.250
-[alter ego] Come on.
-[sighs]

52:44.333 --> 52:45.500
[alter ego] Answer it.

52:47.125 --> 52:47.958
-No.
-[ringing]

52:48.041 --> 52:50.166
[alter ego]
But you have to. You know that.

52:50.916 --> 52:53.500
-I don't want to.
-[alter ego] But you always do.

52:53.583 --> 52:56.916
Come on, there's nothing to be afraid of.
You know who it is.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.083
It's the British Consulate in India.

52:59.166 --> 53:00.541
No, please.

53:00.625 --> 53:02.208
They have terrible news.

53:02.291 --> 53:04.875
-Please.
-There's been an accident.

53:10.458 --> 53:12.000
[ringing continues]

53:12.083 --> 53:13.166
[sighs]

53:16.083 --> 53:17.833
[ringing]

53:19.083 --> 53:20.208
[Henry sighs]

53:24.041 --> 53:25.375
[clears throat] Hello.

53:28.833 --> 53:29.958
Yes, speaking.

53:33.875 --> 53:35.833
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

53:41.958 --> 53:42.833
[sniffs]

53:44.000 --> 53:44.875
[inhales sharply]

53:46.250 --> 53:47.958
What sort of an accident?

53:52.625 --> 53:53.458
Oh…

53:56.166 --> 53:57.791
Well, surely, they're all right.

54:04.875 --> 54:05.791
[inhales sharply]

54:08.541 --> 54:10.541
[breathes heavily]

54:10.625 --> 54:11.500
You're wrong.

54:12.125 --> 54:13.000
[clears throat]

54:16.083 --> 54:17.041
You're mistaken.

54:22.833 --> 54:23.833
[exhales]

54:25.333 --> 54:26.166
[pants]

54:26.250 --> 54:27.250
[whimpers]

54:28.083 --> 54:30.125
[pants, cries out]

54:30.625 --> 54:32.166
[panicked breaths]

54:32.250 --> 54:33.541
[ominous music playing]

54:36.208 --> 54:37.166
[screaming]

54:46.291 --> 54:47.458
[sighs]

54:48.750 --> 54:49.583
[sniffles]

54:55.625 --> 54:57.625
[panting]

54:59.541 --> 55:01.500
[alter ego] That wasn't so bad, was it?

55:01.583 --> 55:03.083
[exhales heavily] It was hell.

55:03.875 --> 55:05.375
Every time is hell.

55:05.458 --> 55:06.708
No.

55:06.791 --> 55:08.833
That wasn't the worst of it.

55:08.916 --> 55:10.916
Not even arranging their funerals,

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
or burying those empty coffins.

55:13.500 --> 55:14.333
No.

55:14.833 --> 55:17.375
Hell was having to call Bly,

55:17.916 --> 55:20.208
having to break the news,

55:20.291 --> 55:23.833
and having her voice
be the first one you heard

55:23.916 --> 55:25.500
when she picked up the phone.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.666
Her little voice saying…

55:29.208 --> 55:30.958
[Flora] Flora residence.

55:38.916 --> 55:41.250
[Jamie] Sleep talking, sleepwalking.

55:42.083 --> 55:43.750
She's having a rough time of it.

55:44.500 --> 55:45.333
Yeah.

55:46.291 --> 55:47.333
Yeah, I…

55:50.041 --> 55:51.875
I don't know what else to do.

55:51.958 --> 55:55.500
So, yeah, I think I'm gonna take her
to a doctor in the morning.

55:56.250 --> 55:57.625
She needs a psychologist.

55:59.625 --> 56:01.333
We have mandated therapy inside.

56:02.250 --> 56:04.541
I hated it.
Didn't think it would do anything.

56:06.083 --> 56:10.083
My assigned psychologist, Tamara,
she was relentless.

56:10.166 --> 56:12.041
A dog with a bone, that woman.

56:14.041 --> 56:16.166
So, I started talking just to shut her up.

56:17.250 --> 56:20.041
After a month, I realized
I was sleeping through the night.

56:21.041 --> 56:21.875
Wow.

56:23.375 --> 56:24.208
Yeah.

56:25.666 --> 56:26.666
You might be right.

56:28.083 --> 56:29.041
[sighs]

56:30.958 --> 56:31.791
I'm gonna go.

56:32.833 --> 56:33.750
Oh.

56:33.833 --> 56:36.083
I should change my clothes, at least.

56:36.708 --> 56:37.541
[laughs]

56:39.333 --> 56:40.541
Well, um…

56:42.125 --> 56:43.333
y-you could…

56:44.375 --> 56:45.291
come back.

56:46.375 --> 56:47.916
-Tonight?
-Yeah.

56:48.833 --> 56:49.750
Tonight.

56:51.916 --> 56:53.208
I don't know, Poppins.

56:54.250 --> 56:56.541
I don't know, you've got your hands full.
[sighs]

57:00.666 --> 57:04.333
Well, I'm gonna be up all night
checking up on her, anyway.

57:07.375 --> 57:08.208
Good night.

57:09.458 --> 57:10.416
Just good night.

57:13.208 --> 57:14.583
There are other nights,

57:15.166 --> 57:16.750
and there will be other nights.

57:17.583 --> 57:18.583
You promise?

57:25.708 --> 57:26.583
[Jamie chuckles]

57:26.666 --> 57:27.875
[Dani laughs gently]

57:29.750 --> 57:31.166
-Promise.
-[Dani] Mm.

57:39.833 --> 57:41.916
[sighs] Fuck it.

57:42.916 --> 57:43.875
This again.

57:49.541 --> 57:50.583
Disconnected.

57:51.250 --> 57:52.291
Phone trouble?

57:55.083 --> 57:55.916
[Henry sighs]

57:57.333 --> 57:59.250
[ominous rumbling]

57:59.375 --> 58:00.916
Phone's disconnected.

58:01.583 --> 58:02.416
So?

58:02.916 --> 58:06.208
So, it shouldn't be. It wasn't earlier.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.625
I'm sure it's nothing.

58:10.625 --> 58:13.708
[ominous rumble, drone]

58:15.375 --> 58:17.166
-What are you doing?
-Going.

58:17.791 --> 58:19.958
-What?
-I'm going to Bly.

58:20.041 --> 58:22.333
-[ominous boom]
-[scoffs] That's insane.

58:22.416 --> 58:23.625
It's a three-hour drive,

58:23.708 --> 58:26.666
and you've been drinking all--
Well, for two years, really.

58:26.750 --> 58:28.583
-That's no reason.
-[ominous boom]

58:28.666 --> 58:31.416
[sighs]
What's the point? The nanny has got this.

58:31.500 --> 58:33.208
You couldn't do anything, anyway.

58:33.291 --> 58:35.250
-I have a terrible feeling.
-[ominous boom]

58:35.333 --> 58:36.666
Oh, well, that settles it.

58:38.333 --> 58:41.291
I haven't had a feeling like this since--

58:41.375 --> 58:44.875
So, you'll go to Bly, then?
They'll be so happy to see you.

58:44.958 --> 58:47.666
And maybe you can tell
those little kids to their faces

58:47.750 --> 58:49.625
exactly how their parents died.

58:49.708 --> 58:52.333
And you can tell them
why they were taking that trip

58:52.416 --> 58:53.666
in the first place.

58:54.291 --> 58:55.416
[ominous boom]

59:20.208 --> 59:21.083
Hello?

59:25.916 --> 59:26.750
Wait!

59:40.666 --> 59:41.500
Hello?

1:00:01.083 --> 1:00:01.916
There you are.

1:00:03.125 --> 1:00:04.250
Don't be scared.

1:00:04.958 --> 1:00:06.833
[somber music playing]

1:00:06.916 --> 1:00:08.500
I'm sorry I was scared before.

1:00:09.583 --> 1:00:12.250
That was very rude of me, but…

1:00:12.333 --> 1:00:14.083
I thought I'd give you a story.

1:00:16.166 --> 1:00:17.375
You poor boy.

1:00:18.291 --> 1:00:20.250
I'm so sorry about your face.

1:00:25.375 --> 1:00:26.208
Here.

1:00:30.458 --> 1:00:31.333
Try this.

1:00:39.791 --> 1:00:40.791
There.

1:00:40.875 --> 1:00:41.750
There you are.

1:00:43.541 --> 1:00:45.458
Now, let's come up with a story…

1:00:46.375 --> 1:00:47.208
just for you.

1:00:50.250 --> 1:00:52.750
I've done it again, haven't I?

1:00:54.083 --> 1:00:57.375
I'm tucked away again in another memory.

1:00:58.000 --> 1:00:59.708
Because the night I did this,

1:01:00.291 --> 1:01:02.291
the night I gave you a new face,

1:01:02.375 --> 1:01:04.791
I was only just five years old.

1:01:05.666 --> 1:01:06.791
Wasn't I?

1:01:09.041 --> 1:01:10.958
Why do you keep doing this to me?

1:01:11.750 --> 1:01:13.208
Just tell me.

1:01:13.291 --> 1:01:16.000
Why do you keep pushing me aside?

1:01:16.083 --> 1:01:17.416
Miss Jessel.

1:01:24.333 --> 1:01:25.291
Come on, now.

1:01:26.083 --> 1:01:27.250
No more.

1:01:28.666 --> 1:01:30.416
I don't like this game.

1:01:31.333 --> 1:01:33.208
Stop hiding from me.

1:01:33.291 --> 1:01:35.291
I want to talk to you.

1:01:38.583 --> 1:01:40.208
[suspenseful music playing]

1:01:40.291 --> 1:01:41.833
I'm very cross with you.

1:01:42.750 --> 1:01:43.625
But why?

1:01:44.166 --> 1:01:45.500
Everything is just fine.

1:01:45.583 --> 1:01:47.125
-It's perfectly--
-It's not.

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.291
I'm tired of being tucked away.

1:01:50.375 --> 1:01:54.541
I'm tired of forgetting things,
and I'm tired of acting strange.

1:01:55.083 --> 1:01:56.875
And of Miles acting strange.

1:01:58.625 --> 1:02:00.125
What's the matter with Miles?

1:02:00.208 --> 1:02:02.458
Miles is perfectly splendid,

1:02:02.541 --> 1:02:04.458
except when he isn't.

1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:06.333
Isn't splendid?

1:02:06.416 --> 1:02:08.083
Isn't Miles.

1:02:08.791 --> 1:02:09.625
[Flora sighs]

1:02:12.333 --> 1:02:13.458
No.

1:02:13.541 --> 1:02:15.125
Don't do that!

1:02:15.208 --> 1:02:17.041
You mustn't keep doing that.

1:02:18.250 --> 1:02:20.875
Get back here and let me see you!

1:02:22.291 --> 1:02:23.791
What are you doing to me?

1:02:24.625 --> 1:02:25.583
-I…
-[door creaks open]

1:02:25.666 --> 1:02:26.541
[Dani] Flora?

1:02:27.041 --> 1:02:28.541
[frightening music playing]

1:02:32.750 --> 1:02:33.583
Flora.

1:02:34.166 --> 1:02:35.000
Come here.

1:02:38.083 --> 1:02:39.000
[Flora] It's okay.

1:02:40.375 --> 1:02:41.833
It's only Miss Jessel.

1:02:41.916 --> 1:02:43.208
Shh, shh, shh.

1:02:46.625 --> 1:02:47.458
Miles!

1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:49.333
Miles!

1:02:50.416 --> 1:02:51.708
-[frightening boom]
-Well…

1:02:52.250 --> 1:02:53.291
this is awkward.

1:02:55.458 --> 1:02:56.291
Miles!

1:02:56.375 --> 1:02:58.083
[music intensifies]

1:02:58.166 --> 1:02:59.291
[music fades into silence]

1:02:59.916 --> 1:03:00.750
What?

1:03:00.833 --> 1:03:02.083
Flora. Flora!

1:03:02.166 --> 1:03:03.791
No, Flora! Flora!

1:03:03.875 --> 1:03:06.000
[footsteps pounding rapidly]

1:03:06.083 --> 1:03:07.208
Flora!

1:03:09.625 --> 1:03:10.458
Flora.

1:03:11.125 --> 1:03:12.875
[suspenseful music playing]

1:03:12.958 --> 1:03:14.375
Flora, where are you?

1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:17.416
Flora.

1:03:19.375 --> 1:03:20.500
Flora, we gotta go.

1:03:21.708 --> 1:03:22.875
Come on.

1:03:24.958 --> 1:03:25.916
I'm sorry.

1:03:27.708 --> 1:03:29.083
[frightening musical swell]

1:03:29.166 --> 1:03:31.208
-[thud]
-[music abruptly stops]

1:03:33.833 --> 1:03:35.750
[closing music playing]
