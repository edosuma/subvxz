00:01.959 --> 00:03.480
Ah, what a

00:03.481 --> 00:05.000
beautiful day!

00:05.584 --> 00:07.500
(SCREECHING)

00:07.542 --> 00:09.334
- I don't remember
- the weather report

00:09.375 --> 00:10.709
Saying there's

00:10.710 --> 00:12.042
an 80% chance

00:09.375 --> 00:12.042
of cage!

00:12.083 --> 00:13.417
Help!

00:13.459 --> 00:14.917
Child trapped

00:14.918 --> 00:16.375
in a fruitsicle

00:13.459 --> 00:16.375
stick prison here!

00:17.000 --> 00:18.250
Nobody?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.667
New Yorkers.

00:21.959 --> 00:23.500
- So that was
- my nightmare.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.667
- What do you think
- being trapped in a

00:25.709 --> 00:26.814
Fruitsicle stick

00:26.815 --> 00:27.918
cage means?

00:27.959 --> 00:29.085
We're studying dreams

00:29.086 --> 00:30.209
in psychology class.

00:30.626 --> 00:31.709
Obviously, you're

00:31.710 --> 00:32.792
afraid of Nicolas Cage.

00:33.959 --> 00:35.376
Yeah, well, who isn't?

00:35.377 --> 00:36.792
Two words, crazy eyes.

00:37.792 --> 00:39.334
- But I think I have
- a better theory.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.564
That any frozen treat

00:40.565 --> 00:41.751
that leaves you with

00:39.375 --> 00:41.751
a purple tongue

00:41.792 --> 00:43.667
- for two days may
- not be good for you?

00:44.083 --> 00:45.542
What do you expect?

00:45.543 --> 00:47.000
There's no such fruit

00:44.083 --> 00:47.000
as a "graple-berry."

00:47.709 --> 00:49.334
- No, I think Zuri's
- just stressing

00:49.375 --> 00:50.522
Because her

00:50.523 --> 00:51.667
Empire State Building

00:49.375 --> 00:51.667
stick model is due Monday,

00:51.709 --> 00:53.230
- and she hasn't even
- started it yet.

00:53.584 --> 00:55.000
- Wait a minute,
- back up!

00:55.751 --> 00:57.059
- You're telling
- me that there's

00:57.083 --> 00:59.000
- No such fruit as
- a "graple-berry"?

00:59.751 --> 01:01.000
No, there isn't.

01:01.584 --> 01:03.231
Then what grows on

01:03.232 --> 01:04.876
a graple-berry tree?

01:05.876 --> 01:07.116
- (CHUCKLES)

02:03.834 --> 02:06.000
last night too.

02:07.584 --> 02:08.814
(IN A MOCK CHILD VOICE)

02:08.815 --> 02:10.042
Gee, Bertram. Why don't

02:07.584 --> 02:10.042
you tell us all about it.

02:10.083 --> 02:11.083
(NORMAL VOICE) Okay.

02:12.083 --> 02:13.542
I was back in high school,

02:13.543 --> 02:15.000
and my pants fell down.

02:15.542 --> 02:17.042
Everyone saw my

02:17.083 --> 02:18.751
- famous-butlers-in-history
- boxers!

02:19.125 --> 02:21.000
- Including
- Little Jeeves!

02:22.709 --> 02:24.000
You in your boxers?

02:24.417 --> 02:25.522
Sounds like a nightmare

02:25.523 --> 02:26.626
for everybody else.

02:27.709 --> 02:28.834
Oh! I know what

02:28.835 --> 02:29.959
that dream means.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.751
You have a deep-seated

02:31.752 --> 02:33.000
fear of belts.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.460
I'm pretty sure

02:35.461 --> 02:36.751
it means he's anxious

02:34.167 --> 02:36.751
about something,

02:36.792 --> 02:37.918
and that there is no way

02:37.959 --> 02:39.000
you're passing psychology.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.751
I am nervous

02:41.792 --> 02:42.938
about going to my

02:42.939 --> 02:44.083
thirtieth high school

02:41.792 --> 02:44.083
reunion tomorrow night.

02:44.125 --> 02:45.792
ALL: Oh!

02:47.083 --> 02:48.417
Whoa!

02:48.459 --> 02:49.689
Is there a lifeguard

02:49.690 --> 02:50.918
on duty in there?

02:51.584 --> 02:53.084
Why are you afraid

02:53.085 --> 02:54.584
of getting together

02:51.584 --> 02:54.584
with your old classmates?

02:54.626 --> 02:56.000
And antiperspirant?

02:56.876 --> 02:58.042
- Because my
- old nemesis,

02:58.083 --> 03:00.000
- Eric Booth,
- is going be there.

03:01.083 --> 03:02.897
He always teased me.

03:02.898 --> 03:04.709
Meanwhile, now he's a

03:01.083 --> 03:04.709
Wall Street millionaire,

03:04.751 --> 03:06.500
- and I'm going to
- feel like a loser.

03:06.542 --> 03:07.605
Oh, Bertram,

03:07.606 --> 03:08.667
you are not a loser!

03:09.000 --> 03:10.355
No. You are

03:10.356 --> 03:11.709
a very...

03:09.000 --> 03:11.709
No?

03:12.584 --> 03:13.688
And you've got

03:13.689 --> 03:14.792
a lot of...

03:12.584 --> 03:14.792
Lot of...

03:16.834 --> 03:18.001
And don't forget about

03:18.002 --> 03:19.167
your fantastic...

03:19.209 --> 03:21.000
Fantastic, what? Eh...

03:21.709 --> 03:22.792
A little help here?

03:24.167 --> 03:25.918
We got nothin'.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.626
- Look, Jessie!
- Mummy Massacre!

03:32.667 --> 03:34.189
This is the new

03:34.190 --> 03:35.709
video game all the cool

03:32.667 --> 03:35.709
kids are playing.

03:35.751 --> 03:36.876
How do you know

03:36.877 --> 03:38.000
what the cool kids

03:35.751 --> 03:38.000
are doing?

03:38.876 --> 03:39.938
Did one of them

03:39.939 --> 03:41.000
finally talk to you?

03:42.709 --> 03:43.751
No, but if

03:43.752 --> 03:44.792
I play this game,

03:44.834 --> 03:45.939
it will give me

03:45.940 --> 03:47.042
something to say

03:44.834 --> 03:47.042
to them besides,

03:47.083 --> 03:48.583
"Just because I can

03:48.584 --> 03:50.083
fit in my locker, does

03:47.083 --> 03:50.083
not mean I enjoy it."

03:50.584 --> 03:51.626
Well, I suppose you

03:51.627 --> 03:52.667
can get it. I mean,

03:52.709 --> 03:54.292
- you ask for
- so little and...

03:54.334 --> 03:55.667
Holy aorta, what is

03:55.668 --> 03:57.000
that mummy doing to

03:54.334 --> 03:57.000
that guy's heart?

03:57.167 --> 03:59.042
- I admit it is
- a little violent.

03:59.083 --> 04:00.667
A little?

04:00.709 --> 04:02.188
No. I'm sorry, Ravi,

04:02.189 --> 04:03.667
I can't let you have

04:00.709 --> 04:03.667
such a gory game.

04:07.083 --> 04:09.063
Ravi, the trick is to

04:09.064 --> 04:11.042
buy the game without

04:07.083 --> 04:11.042
asking permission.

04:11.083 --> 04:13.042
- We call that,
- "Pulling a Zuri."

04:13.083 --> 04:14.560
- And by the way, - I'm going to
- Tell the owner

04:14.584 --> 04:15.792
Not to sell you that game.

04:15.793 --> 04:17.000
Just in case you're

04:14.584 --> 04:17.000
thinking of

04:17.041 --> 04:18.041
pulling a Zuri.

04:20.083 --> 04:21.834
Fiddlesticks!

04:21.875 --> 04:23.626
Ravi, language!

04:24.667 --> 04:26.314
You are right.

04:26.315 --> 04:27.959
I will wash my own

04:24.667 --> 04:27.959
mouth out with soap.

04:28.209 --> 04:29.688
But now, thanks to Jessie,

04:29.689 --> 04:31.167
I will never be cool!

04:32.125 --> 04:34.000
- You can't blame
- that all on Jessie.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:45.083 --> 04:46.647
I will not do this.

04:46.648 --> 04:48.209
I cannot do this.

04:49.959 --> 04:51.001
I have done it!

04:51.002 --> 04:52.042
I am a thief!

04:52.083 --> 04:53.042
- But not a very
- good one,

04:53.083 --> 04:55.000
- Because I am
- narrating my crime.

04:59.792 --> 05:01.314
Oh, Bertram, I've been

05:01.315 --> 05:02.834
thinking a lot about

04:59.792 --> 05:02.834
your pathetic life.

05:02.876 --> 05:03.980
Oh, I actually prefer

05:03.981 --> 05:05.083
that to you talking

05:02.876 --> 05:05.083
about yours.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.667
- I think we can
- all agree that

05:08.709 --> 05:09.960
You both have very

05:09.961 --> 05:11.209
little to wake up

05:08.709 --> 05:11.209
for in the morning.

05:12.167 --> 05:13.584
Okay. What I was

05:13.585 --> 05:15.000
trying to say, before

05:12.167 --> 05:15.000
the ugliness started,

05:15.751 --> 05:16.876
was I know how

05:16.877 --> 05:18.000
you can enjoy

05:15.751 --> 05:18.000
your reunion.

05:18.167 --> 05:19.438
Kidnap Eric Booth,

05:19.439 --> 05:20.709
ship him to the North Pole,

05:20.751 --> 05:22.042
- slather him
- in seal grease,

05:22.083 --> 05:23.667
- And feed him
- to polar bears?

05:24.125 --> 05:25.563
No, and you've clearly

05:25.564 --> 05:27.000
thought way too

05:24.125 --> 05:27.000
hard about this.

05:28.083 --> 05:29.542
No, you should just go

05:29.543 --> 05:31.000
and tell them all

05:28.083 --> 05:31.000
you're a big success.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.083
Ooh, lying,

05:33.084 --> 05:34.084
I like it!

05:34.125 --> 05:35.584
If you need any help,

05:35.585 --> 05:37.042
I'm your girl.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.167
I'm actually writing

05:38.168 --> 05:39.250
a book on lying.

05:39.292 --> 05:40.646
You are?

05:40.647 --> 05:42.000
No. See? Lie!

05:43.375 --> 05:44.709
Okay, Zuri, I am not

05:44.710 --> 05:46.042
suggesting he lie.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.351
- In the acting profession,
- we call it

05:47.375 --> 05:48.626
"creating a backstory."

05:48.627 --> 05:49.876
I do it for all my parts.

05:50.334 --> 05:51.563
Considering you haven't

05:51.564 --> 05:52.792
gotten any parts,

05:52.834 --> 05:53.939
I'm going to keep the

05:53.940 --> 05:55.042
polar bears as plan B.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.751
Luke,

06:00.792 --> 06:02.667
- I have something
- to show you.

06:02.959 --> 06:04.040
- I'm trying to
- read here.

06:05.375 --> 06:07.000
Check this out!

06:07.834 --> 06:09.000
Whoa!

06:09.751 --> 06:11.334
Is that Mummy Massacre?

06:11.876 --> 06:13.293
Jessie told me

06:13.294 --> 06:14.709
I couldn't buy violent

06:11.876 --> 06:14.709
video games anymore!

06:14.751 --> 06:16.000
I did not buy it.

06:18.083 --> 06:19.250
I stole it!

06:20.083 --> 06:22.000
You stole it?

06:22.959 --> 06:24.209
Whoa.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.250
You went from

06:25.251 --> 06:26.250
goody goody to

06:24.250 --> 06:26.250
naughty naughty!

06:27.083 --> 06:28.126
I thought I would be

06:28.127 --> 06:29.167
overcome by guilt,

06:29.209 --> 06:30.709
but instead I feel

06:30.710 --> 06:32.209
strangely exhilarated.

06:32.250 --> 06:33.647
As if I just

06:33.648 --> 06:35.042
solved a difficult

06:32.250 --> 06:35.042
algebraic equation,

06:35.083 --> 06:36.709
- or completed
- a push-up.

06:36.751 --> 06:37.793
The latter is, of course,

06:37.794 --> 06:38.834
a hypothetical.

06:39.292 --> 06:40.626
Yeah, yeah. Less chatter,

06:40.627 --> 06:41.959
more splatter.

06:47.042 --> 06:48.042
I just ripped out

06:48.043 --> 06:49.043
that mummy's spleen!

06:49.083 --> 06:51.042
- Shame on his embalmers
- for leaving that in.

06:51.083 --> 06:52.083
(DOOR OPENING)

06:53.042 --> 06:54.042
What is going

06:54.043 --> 06:55.043
on in here?

06:55.083 --> 06:57.042
- I haven't heard this
- much screaming

06:57.083 --> 06:59.000
- Since Bertram passed
- that kidney stone.

06:59.876 --> 07:01.459
- We are playing
- Mummy Massacre.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.209
Wait a minute.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.272
I thought Jessie said

07:04.273 --> 07:05.292
you couldn't buy that?

07:05.918 --> 07:07.042
He didn't.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.417
He stole it.

07:08.459 --> 07:09.606
No, seriously,

07:09.607 --> 07:10.751
how'd you get it?

07:11.083 --> 07:13.000
- It is true,
- I stole it.

07:13.834 --> 07:14.856
Please do not

07:14.857 --> 07:15.876
tell Jessie!

07:16.083 --> 07:17.667
Okay, but it's

07:17.668 --> 07:19.250
gonna cost you.

07:20.167 --> 07:21.938
You have to finish

07:21.939 --> 07:23.709
my fruitsicle-stick project.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.250
Very well.

07:25.292 --> 07:27.133
- And I assume by
- "finish," you mean "start."

07:28.083 --> 07:29.834
You know me so well.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.000
(HOWLING)

07:35.083 --> 07:37.059
- Thanks for taking us - to the
park to play - Basketball, Jessie.

07:37.083 --> 07:38.230
Sure. Guys, maybe instead

07:38.231 --> 07:39.375
of playing basketball,

07:39.417 --> 07:41.042
- we should run in fear.
- (GROANING)

07:41.083 --> 07:42.584
Why?

07:42.626 --> 07:44.351
- Oh, just the undead - walking towards us,
- Looking to play

07:44.375 --> 07:46.000
- Jump rope with
- our intestines.

07:46.042 --> 07:47.042
(SCREAMING)

07:47.459 --> 07:49.042
- Oh.
- Oh!

07:49.083 --> 07:50.292
Sorry. I would say

07:50.293 --> 07:51.500
you should put a

07:49.083 --> 07:51.500
bandage on that,

07:51.542 --> 07:52.710
but well,

07:52.711 --> 07:53.876
you know.

07:53.918 --> 07:54.959
(GROANING)

07:54.960 --> 07:56.000
(SCREAMING)

07:57.083 --> 07:59.001
Jessie! No!

07:59.002 --> 08:00.918
Luke! Can I have

07:57.083 --> 08:00.918
your room?

08:01.542 --> 08:03.000
- This is why
- I hate sports!

08:03.417 --> 08:05.230
Hello, I can name all

08:05.231 --> 08:07.042
the pharaohs in

08:03.417 --> 08:07.042
chronological-order!

08:07.083 --> 08:08.522
Give me a "what-what"

08:08.523 --> 08:09.959
if you are on Team Tut!

08:10.000 --> 08:11.334
(SCREAMING)

08:13.083 --> 08:16.042
(SCREAMING)

08:16.083 --> 08:17.250
EMMA: Ravi?

08:17.292 --> 08:18.606
Aw, were you dreaming

08:18.607 --> 08:19.918
about sports again?

08:21.417 --> 08:23.417
Yes, and mummies.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.042
- They were ripping
- me apart!

08:25.083 --> 08:27.000
- Like human
- string cheese!

08:27.876 --> 08:29.083
Fascinating!

08:29.167 --> 08:30.584
A dream about mummies

08:30.585 --> 08:32.000
can only mean one thing.

08:33.082 --> 08:35.042
- You're afraid of running
- out of toilet paper.

08:36.042 --> 08:37.042
Who is not?

08:37.375 --> 08:38.729
But I think

08:38.730 --> 08:40.082
my nightmare

08:40.125 --> 08:41.730
is because I pilfered

08:41.731 --> 08:43.333
a mummy-themed video game.

08:43.375 --> 08:44.709
The guilt has

08:44.710 --> 08:46.042
penetrated my

08:43.375 --> 08:46.042
subconscious,

08:46.083 --> 08:47.667
manifesting itself

08:47.668 --> 08:49.250
into a terrifying

08:46.083 --> 08:49.250
nocturnal reverie.

08:51.083 --> 08:53.042
- Me steal
- video game.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.167
Feel bad.

09:00.709 --> 09:02.126
Okay, now remember,

09:02.127 --> 09:03.542
your backstory for

09:00.709 --> 09:03.542
the reunion

09:03.584 --> 09:05.042
is that you made

09:05.043 --> 09:06.500
millions of dollars

09:03.584 --> 09:06.500
as a cat-toy mogul.

09:06.542 --> 09:08.459
- Ooh, ooh, can I say
- it was my idea

09:08.500 --> 09:09.772
To put the bell inside

09:09.773 --> 09:11.042
the toy mouse?

09:11.083 --> 09:12.125
Sure. Go nuts.

09:13.709 --> 09:15.310
- Okay, do you have - your new and improved
- Life memorized?

09:15.334 --> 09:16.813
I'm trying, but you've

09:16.814 --> 09:18.292
given me so much

09:15.334 --> 09:18.292
stuff to remember!

09:18.334 --> 09:19.876
When I need to remember

09:19.877 --> 09:21.417
something, I write it

09:18.334 --> 09:21.417
on my hand.

09:21.459 --> 09:22.771
"Lie to Jessie about

09:22.772 --> 09:24.083
party Saturday night."

09:24.125 --> 09:25.125
Oops.

09:27.042 --> 09:28.250
- She makes my
- job so easy.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.313
Okay, you went

09:31.314 --> 09:32.542
to college at?

09:30.083 --> 09:32.542
Harvard!

09:32.584 --> 09:34.042
- And you have
- vacation homes in?

09:34.083 --> 09:36.042
- Southampton, - Lake Como
- And Bimini!

09:36.083 --> 09:37.355
On the weekends you?

09:37.356 --> 09:38.626
Work as a secret

09:36.083 --> 09:38.626
government agent,

09:38.667 --> 09:39.897
traveling the world,

09:39.898 --> 09:41.125
capturing enemy spies!

09:41.709 --> 09:42.855
What?

09:42.856 --> 09:44.000
Slow your roll,

09:41.709 --> 09:44.000
Lame Bond.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.272
It's supposed to be,

09:46.273 --> 09:48.042
on the weekends

09:44.500 --> 09:48.042
you help needy children.

09:48.083 --> 09:50.000
- I like the spy
- thing better.

09:50.292 --> 09:51.751
Spy? I can hear

09:51.752 --> 09:53.209
you coming from

09:50.292 --> 09:53.209
five rooms away!

09:53.459 --> 09:54.835
My water glass starts

09:54.836 --> 09:56.209
doing the Jurassic Park

09:53.459 --> 09:56.209
shaky-thingy.

09:59.083 --> 10:01.000
- Fine. I help
- needy children.

10:02.083 --> 10:04.042
- Okay, I think you're
- ready to respond

10:04.083 --> 10:06.000
- "will attend"
- to your reunion.

10:06.417 --> 10:08.000
- Oh, no.
- Look at this.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.268
- Bertram, I've already
- seen your screensaver

10:09.292 --> 10:10.646
With you as

10:10.647 --> 10:12.000
the sixth member

10:09.292 --> 10:12.000
of 'N Sync. It's weird.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.126
No. It's a picture

10:14.127 --> 10:15.167
of Eric Booth

10:15.209 --> 10:16.626
and his girlfriend

10:16.627 --> 10:18.042
on the reunion page.

10:18.083 --> 10:20.000
She's stunning! Wow!

10:20.334 --> 10:22.000
Uh, I mean she's...

10:23.334 --> 10:24.688
She's not that beautiful.

10:24.689 --> 10:26.042
She's way out of

10:23.334 --> 10:26.042
your league, but...

10:26.417 --> 10:27.730
I can't show up without

10:27.731 --> 10:29.042
a gorgeous date.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.355
Jessie, would you do me

10:30.356 --> 10:31.626
one more big favor?

10:32.083 --> 10:33.727
- You need a beautiful
- girl to go with you

10:33.751 --> 10:35.043
To the reunion?

10:35.044 --> 10:36.334
No problem, I'll do it.

10:37.083 --> 10:38.375
Oh... Eh...

10:39.751 --> 10:40.876
I meant I wanted you to

10:40.877 --> 10:42.000
call one of your friends.

10:39.751 --> 10:42.000
But, eh...

10:43.083 --> 10:44.292
Okay, you'll do.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.272
Oh, Ravi, you're

10:48.273 --> 10:50.042
supposed to run

10:46.500 --> 10:50.042
from the mummies!

10:50.083 --> 10:52.000
- Not walk like an
- Egyptian towards them!

10:52.751 --> 10:53.897
I deserve to be

10:53.898 --> 10:55.042
disemboweled by

10:52.751 --> 10:55.042
the undead!

10:55.083 --> 10:56.188
I disobeyed Jessie,

10:56.189 --> 10:57.292
and I stole...

10:57.334 --> 10:58.667
And you're keeping me

10:58.668 --> 11:00.000
from beating this game!

10:57.334 --> 11:00.000
So pick it up!

11:01.083 --> 11:03.042
- JESSIE: Ravi?
- Where are you?

11:03.083 --> 11:04.542
Oh, dear! We cannot

11:04.543 --> 11:06.000
let Jessie see the game!

11:06.083 --> 11:07.083
Ow!

11:08.083 --> 11:10.044
- I got it! - I'll eject the game,
- Eat the disk,

11:10.083 --> 11:11.268
- And we'll just wait
- to get it back,

11:11.292 --> 11:12.501
Probably by

11:12.502 --> 11:13.709
tomorrow morning.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.042
- Or we can change
- the channel

11:17.083 --> 11:19.000
- And hide
- the game box.

11:26.083 --> 11:27.126
Hey, guys.

11:27.127 --> 11:28.167
What'cha watching?

11:28.584 --> 11:30.125
Uh, just guy stuff.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.083
The View?

11:33.459 --> 11:34.897
Yes, that Sherri

11:34.898 --> 11:36.334
Shepherd is a hoot!

11:38.083 --> 11:39.125
Okay.

11:39.167 --> 11:40.500
Look,

11:42.375 --> 11:44.059
- Ravi, I've been feeling - bad about
not letting - You get that video game.

11:44.083 --> 11:47.209
So, I got you this.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.000
"Healthy Snackland?"

11:49.334 --> 11:50.667
Yeah, like the box says,

11:50.668 --> 11:52.000
"You'll have a kale

11:49.334 --> 11:52.000
of a good time!"

11:54.083 --> 11:55.583
Thank you, Jessie.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.083
But I do not deserve this.

11:57.334 --> 11:58.542
(HEART BEATING)

12:00.709 --> 12:02.188
Of course you do.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.667
After all, you've

12:00.709 --> 12:03.667
always been so good.

12:04.125 --> 12:05.147
Yes... Good...

12:05.148 --> 12:06.167
(HEART BEATING CONTINUES)

12:08.125 --> 12:09.625
Can somebody please

12:09.626 --> 12:11.125
turn that horrible,

12:08.125 --> 12:11.125
incessant noise off?

12:11.417 --> 12:12.439
Sure.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.459
(SWITCHES OFF TV)

12:13.500 --> 12:14.772
I see someone's

12:14.773 --> 12:16.042
itching to play

12:13.500 --> 12:16.042
Healthy Snackland.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.792
- If you draw three
- antioxidant cards,

12:17.834 --> 12:19.167
You get to ride a

12:19.168 --> 12:20.500
celery toboggan down

12:17.834 --> 12:20.500
Mount Parsnip!

12:23.542 --> 12:25.042
(DOOR CLOSING)

12:25.083 --> 12:26.272
That is it!

12:26.273 --> 12:27.459
I cannot tell a lie.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.334
Yes, you can!

12:29.375 --> 12:30.418
Jessie thinks I put on

12:30.419 --> 12:31.459
clean underwear every day.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.334
- No one thinks
- you do that.

12:36.083 --> 12:37.167
I must sneak this game

12:37.168 --> 12:38.250
back onto the shelf.

12:38.292 --> 12:39.646
Then run as fast as

12:39.647 --> 12:41.000
a boy in orthopedic

12:38.292 --> 12:41.000
sandals can go!

12:45.083 --> 12:46.768
- (DOOR CLOSING) - So the goal
- Is to get to

12:46.792 --> 12:48.022
The Carrot Castle and save

12:48.023 --> 12:49.250
Queen Cabbage? Oh.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.261
- Just looking - at this game
- Gives me gas.

13:01.209 --> 13:02.250
Oh, no.

13:02.292 --> 13:03.417
There's my arch

13:03.418 --> 13:04.542
nemesis, Eric Booth.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.272
Don't worry. Just stick

13:06.273 --> 13:07.626
to your backstory,

13:04.918 --> 13:07.626
and you'll be fine.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.125
Bertram?

13:10.375 --> 13:12.167
Bertram Stinkle?

13:12.209 --> 13:14.209
Hello, Eric.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.459
And it's Winkle.

13:16.500 --> 13:17.647
Not if you were downwind

13:17.648 --> 13:18.792
from your locker, pal.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.167
(LAUGHING)

13:20.209 --> 13:21.897
Wow, you have not

13:21.898 --> 13:23.584
changed a bit.

13:23.626 --> 13:24.834
Sadly.

13:25.542 --> 13:26.918
This is my

13:26.919 --> 13:28.292
girlfriend, Alexia.

13:28.667 --> 13:31.375
It's short for Alex.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.042
Nice to meet you.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.834
This is my girlfriend...

13:36.876 --> 13:37.960
Dr. Jessie Prescott,

13:37.961 --> 13:39.042
Head of Veterinary Medicine

13:39.083 --> 13:40.167
at City Animal Hospital.

13:40.209 --> 13:42.125
- What? When did
- that happen?

13:42.375 --> 13:43.564
Oh. You mean

13:43.565 --> 13:44.751
becoming head

13:42.375 --> 13:44.751
of the department?

13:44.792 --> 13:46.083
- Just last week,
- sweetie.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.834
- After I saved
- the mayor's Cockapoo.

13:47.876 --> 13:48.938
You would not believe

13:48.939 --> 13:50.000
where I found

13:47.876 --> 13:50.000
the key to the city.

13:50.584 --> 13:52.084
I'm in the finance game.

13:52.085 --> 13:53.584
Mergers and acquisitions.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.647
So, tell them how well

13:55.648 --> 13:57.042
you're doing, Stinkle...

13:54.250 --> 13:57.042
I mean, honey.

13:57.918 --> 13:59.876
- I am a cat
- toy model.

13:59.918 --> 14:01.042
- Mogul.
- Mogul.

14:01.417 --> 14:02.896
Really?

14:02.897 --> 14:04.375
Yes, I am a

14:01.417 --> 14:04.375
multi-millionaire,

14:04.417 --> 14:06.105
with homes in

14:06.106 --> 14:07.792
Southampton,

14:04.417 --> 14:07.792
Lake Como, and Jimini.

14:08.125 --> 14:09.125
Bimini.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.226
- Bertram was the one who
- put the bell in the mouse.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.375
(GASPS) I love those.

14:14.417 --> 14:16.375
They're so much fun.

14:16.709 --> 14:18.250
- Oh, how many cats
- do you have?

14:18.292 --> 14:19.459
None.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.334
EMMA: Ravi,

14:27.375 --> 14:28.459
I'm really proud of you

14:28.460 --> 14:29.542
for returning this game.

14:29.792 --> 14:31.083
- It's the right
- thing to do.

14:31.417 --> 14:32.439
And we support

14:32.440 --> 14:33.459
you in that.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.375
- But you're
- being selfish.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.292
- How am I
- being selfish?

14:37.334 --> 14:39.209

21:45.626 --> 21:47.042
- Well, I'm glad you
- feel like it,

21:47.083 --> 21:48.834
- 'cause clearly
- you're not.

21:49.167 --> 21:50.167
I should've known

21:50.168 --> 21:51.167
you were a fraud

21:49.167 --> 21:51.167
the minute you walked in

21:51.209 --> 21:52.667
- with that
- sweet arm candy.

21:52.709 --> 21:53.876
She's even prettier

21:53.877 --> 21:55.042
than my girlfriend.

21:52.709 --> 21:55.042
(ALEXIA GASPS)

21:55.083 --> 21:57.000
- What? Okay,
- that's it!

21:58.250 --> 21:59.980
Eric is not a

21:59.981 --> 22:01.709
Wall Street millionaire.

22:01.751 --> 22:02.792
- Alexia.
- (ALL GASPING)

22:02.834 --> 22:04.059
- He's an unemployed
- bookkeeper,

22:04.083 --> 22:05.563
Who just got fired

22:05.564 --> 22:07.042
by his only client...

22:07.083 --> 22:08.792
- His mother.
- (ALL GASPING AND LAUGHING)

22:10.083 --> 22:12.042
Mom did not fire me.

22:12.083 --> 22:13.147
She laid me off.

22:13.148 --> 22:14.209
There's a big difference!

22:14.250 --> 22:15.585
I'm not even

22:15.586 --> 22:16.918
his girlfriend.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.918
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

22:17.083 --> 22:18.792
I'm his cousin.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.000
- He paid me
- to come here.

22:22.083 --> 22:23.147
By the way,

22:23.148 --> 22:24.209
your check bounced.

22:25.083 --> 22:26.250
So, Eric,

22:26.292 --> 22:28.252
- looks like the only thing
- you have that I want

22:28.292 --> 22:29.834
- Is a full head
- of hair.

22:29.876 --> 22:31.667
- (CHUCKLES)
- You can have that.

22:32.083 --> 22:33.709
- (SCREAMING)
- (ALL GASPING)

22:33.751 --> 22:34.751
That was my

22:34.752 --> 22:35.752
comb-over!

22:38.083 --> 22:39.918
- I haven't seen anything
- move that fast

22:39.959 --> 22:41.313
Since I did my

22:41.314 --> 22:42.667
internship at the African

22:39.959 --> 22:42.667
Cheetah Sanctuary.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.126
Oh, we're not...

22:44.127 --> 22:45.167
Oh, we're not doing

22:43.083 --> 22:45.167
that anymore? My bad.

22:50.334 --> 22:52.000
Ew!

22:53.083 --> 22:54.126
Hey, Ravi, enjoying

22:54.127 --> 22:55.167
your punishment?

22:55.209 --> 22:56.334
Not really.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.647
The last piece of

22:57.648 --> 22:58.918
gum I scrapped off

22:59.083 --> 23:00.751
had a tooth in it.

23:01.083 --> 23:02.584
Hope you kept it.

23:02.626 --> 23:05.059
- The tooth fairy - money will help pay
- For that video game.

23:05.083 --> 23:07.042
- My feet are
- killing me!

23:07.083 --> 23:08.209
Mine too!

23:09.292 --> 23:10.668
I promise I'll

23:10.669 --> 23:12.042
never blackmail

23:09.292 --> 23:12.042
my brother again.

23:12.083 --> 23:14.059
- Don't you mean, - you'll never blackmail
- Anyone again?

23:14.083 --> 23:16.000
- Let's crawl
- before we walk.

23:18.042 --> 23:19.481
And I'm sorry for aiding

23:19.482 --> 23:20.918
and abetting a fugitive,

23:20.959 --> 23:22.500
destroying evidence,

23:22.542 --> 23:23.647
and changing your

23:23.648 --> 23:24.751
FacePage status to

23:22.542 --> 23:24.751
"Dating Luke Ross."

23:25.083 --> 23:26.143
- Wait! What was
- that last one?

23:26.167 --> 23:27.334
Nothing!

23:27.375 --> 23:29.042
- Get your video
- games here!

23:30.417 --> 23:31.876
I don't understand

23:31.877 --> 23:33.334
why you're forcing

23:30.417 --> 23:33.334
me to work here.

23:33.375 --> 23:35.042
- I told Ravi the right
- thing to do,

23:35.083 --> 23:36.792
- And I even tried
- to help him!

23:36.834 --> 23:38.105
Yeah, sorry about that,

23:38.106 --> 23:39.375
but with all four of you

23:36.834 --> 23:39.375
being punished,

23:39.417 --> 23:41.000
- it means I get
- the afternoon off.

23:41.417 --> 23:42.751
Peace!
