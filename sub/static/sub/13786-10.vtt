We came here for more
of his medicine and supplies.

05:38.296 --> 05:43.757
New Earth Republic soldiers tell us
we can't leave town.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.467
The great sickness has come.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.094
If it spreads,

05:48.265 --> 05:52.759
I fear the humans will once again
hunt and kill us.

05:53.812 --> 05:57.350
Little Wolf, will you pray with us?

06:00.318 --> 06:03.310

15:52.076 --> 15:54.783

15:55.371 --> 15:58.363
I don't think they caught Nizar.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.656
