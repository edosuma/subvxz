Oh, well, okay.

00:14.481 --> 00:15.681
- Oot-oot-oot.

No touchies.

That board is for rank-and-file
union business only.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.688
Off limits to you, Chiefie.

00:22.823 --> 00:23.956
- All right,
then you take it down.

00:24.091 --> 00:26.025
- But I made it
"owl" by myself.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.360
- I don't have time
for pun and games.

00:27.494 --> 00:28.761
- That's a pun.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.162
- I gotta prep
for the council meeting.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.564
I got to start
the Baker Fiscal Reporter.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.033
- Wah-wah, wah-wah,
wah-wah, wah-wah.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.300
- Take it down now!

00:35.436 --> 00:37.770
- Okay. I'll...

00:37.905 --> 00:40.305
hop to it.
[laughs]

00:40.441 --> 00:41.907
- I'm the boss, Eddie.

00:41.909 --> 00:43.709
- Oh, we all know
"hoo" is the boss.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.911
But you don't have to be so
serious about it all the time.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.246
Sometimes you are as boring

00:47.248 --> 00:49.248
as that sweet tea
you like to drink.

00:49.384 --> 00:52.918
- Sweet tea is reliable
and neutral, like me!

00:52.920 --> 00:55.388
- I prefer my chief
to be a root beer float,

00:55.522 --> 00:59.392
effervescent, with a pinch
of sassy-fras, like me.

00:59.526 --> 01:01.060
- Mom and Dad
are fighting again.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.661
- Mom over here thinks
that being in charge

01:02.663 --> 01:03.996
is like having a soft drink.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.598
- You're the mom.
You're the one who says

01:05.733 --> 01:07.933
things like, "I'm doing this
for your own good."

01:08.069 --> 01:09.868
And, "Don't take that tone
of voice with me."

01:09.870 --> 01:11.470
That's you.
- I don't think I like

01:11.472 --> 01:13.606
the gender inferences
being used in this argument.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.074
- Then stay out of it.
- Hey.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.675
- Why is this fridge
always a disaster?

01:16.811 --> 01:18.211
And where's my sweet tea?

01:18.345 --> 01:20.012
- Sometimes I wish I was chief
so I could show you

01:20.147 --> 01:22.147
how to do this job properly.
- And I wish I could just

01:22.149 --> 01:24.016
lie around all day
and do nothing like you.

01:24.151 --> 01:25.618
- Oh, you think I just
lie around all day?

01:25.753 --> 01:27.086
I work for a living.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.553
I don't sit behind a desk
drinking sweet tea.

01:28.555 --> 01:31.757
That's for sure.
- I think I got it back here.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.492
Oh!
- [gasps]

01:33.628 --> 01:34.894
Oh, my gosh.

Oh, my gosh, Dad!
Dad, are you okay?

- Ahh, my back.
- Hey, Chief.

01:40.901 --> 01:41.901
I found your sweet tea.

01:42.036 --> 01:43.368
- Screw you, Eddie.

to announce you?

the same rank, Penisi.

He's the chief now.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.883

- And during that time,

03:39.286 --> 03:41.086
I command you
to not bring us down

03:41.088 --> 03:42.821

04:01.442 --> 04:02.641
You're my guy.

04:02.777 --> 04:04.309
- What kind of stuff
would I have to do though?

04:04.311 --> 04:05.844
- All leaders need
a right-hand man

04:05.846 --> 04:07.380
to help them lead.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.048
And also to let them know
the behind-the-scenes stuff

are digging the vibe.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.251

'Cause I'm the girl?

- No, you just seem like you'd
be good at folding linens.

04:31.538 --> 04:34.139
All right, Andy, you will be
in charge of the food run.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.540
- Come on,
I did that last shift.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.476
- I wasn't here last shift.
- I hate that job.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.344
Everybody always complains,
and no one's ever satisfied.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.146
- It's 'cause you're always
getting the wrong stuff, bro.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.548
You came back here with Hydrox
instead of Oreos.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.818
- Same thing, bro.
- No, it's not, bro.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.820
Oreos are
a cultural touchstone.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.288
While Hydrox is something

04:49.424 --> 04:50.756
that you give to prisoners
in a food line.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.958
- And plus, you always
get bruised apples.

04:53.094 --> 04:54.960
So my advice,
don't get bruised apples.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.562
- Yeah, bro, didn't anyone ever
teach you how to choose fruit?

04:57.564 --> 04:59.164
- Shut up.
Everybody just shut up.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.566
See, I already hate this job.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.701
- You're on shopping duty,
and that's it, okay?

05:02.837 --> 05:05.304
Here is my list, and get
the morel mushrooms, okay?

05:05.440 --> 05:07.706
Not the chanterelles,

- What, are you gonna chip
into the fund?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.043
- Captain of the B shift

05:11.178 --> 05:13.178
doesn't chip in
for the A shift.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.713
- But, Frenchie,
you eat all our food.

05:14.849 --> 05:17.182
You should chip in.
- Ooh. Don't mind if I do.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.184
- Just don't touch
my cake, man.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.585
- Oh, come on, man.

05:20.587 --> 05:21.720
You're about to eat
it right now.

05:21.856 --> 05:24.389
- No name, fair game.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.059

"Thank you, Granny," on it.

- I don't see any name on here.

05:28.463 --> 05:29.795

but you just ate it.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.264
It's said Granny on it.

- He coaches soccer.

That's his special cake.

- Do you think that's
a good idea, Granny?

06:31.458 --> 06:33.326
I mean, you kind of got lost
in that game last time.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.594

than a game.

06:35.730 --> 06:37.262

08:00.815 --> 08:02.481
- Looks like you guys
are having fun.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.816
- Hey, what's up, Terry?

08:03.951 --> 08:05.150
Who had Terry
showing up on day four?

08:05.286 --> 08:06.351
- Oh, that was me.
- Oh!

08:06.487 --> 08:08.553
- Oh, come on!
- Oh, yes!

08:08.555 --> 08:10.623
- You hungry? Have some food.
- No, I'm good.

08:10.758 --> 08:13.092
Can't really eat
with my meds, so--

08:13.227 --> 08:16.095
- Have a cheese ball.
- Yeah.

08:16.097 --> 08:18.564
- Thanks.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.768
- Oh, boy.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.243
- What are you doing here,
Terry?

08:30.377 --> 08:33.178
- Well, my daughter's learning
to play the clarinet at home,

08:33.314 --> 08:35.380
and it was driving me crazy,
so--

08:35.516 --> 08:37.049
- I think you came
to check up on me.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.318
But as you can see,
it's going great.

08:39.454 --> 08:40.853
- Yeah, yeah,
the apparatus floor

08:40.988 --> 08:42.255
looks like a Dave & Buster's.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.856
The break room looks like
a hookah lounge.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.858
And I found my chair
in the dumpster outside.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.460
- Well, surely,
you don't expect me

08:47.595 --> 08:49.394
to sit in another man's
blast zone, do you?

08:49.530 --> 08:52.932
No. I need a chair that's
more apropos of my chiefdom.

08:53.067 --> 08:55.568
Speaking of which.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.808
What's behind this door, hmm?

09:02.810 --> 09:04.877
What chief-y secrets
are you keeping in here?

09:05.012 --> 09:06.679
You got scotch, cigars?
- It's nothing.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.481
- Oh, well, if it's nothing,
why don't you

09:08.616 --> 09:10.349
just give me the key
and I'll have a little looksee?

09:10.485 --> 09:12.084
- I don't have a key.
- Hmm.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.419
[knocking]
- Hey, old chief.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.489
Chief, got your breakfast.

09:16.623 --> 09:18.624
- Thank you, Ikey. How about
right on my desk, please?

09:18.759 --> 09:20.359
- You got it.
[Hoser barking]

09:20.495 --> 09:22.027
- Hey, did you see Hoser?

09:22.029 --> 09:25.230
- Yeah, great to see him back.
- Awesome, right?

09:25.232 --> 09:26.899
Oh, Ike,
will you let Frenchie know

09:27.034 --> 09:29.101
that I'm in the mood
for some Bolognese.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.970
- You bet.

09:30.972 --> 09:33.372
- And will get some Tomaso's
tomatoes for the sauce, please?

09:33.508 --> 09:36.041
- You got it.
- Thank you.

09:36.177 --> 09:38.577
Excuse me, Chiefie.

09:38.713 --> 09:40.245
See, Terry, chiefing is easy.

09:40.381 --> 09:41.514
I show up for work
in the morning.

09:41.649 --> 09:42.848
I leave the same day.

09:42.984 --> 09:44.650
I have my breakfast
delivered to me.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.186
- Eddie, you'll find that
being chief is more than that.

09:47.322 --> 09:49.121
You have to make
some tough decisions.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.523
[mimics farting]

09:50.658 --> 09:51.991
- Can you believe my GAK

09:52.126 --> 09:53.859
retained its slime
after all these years?

09:53.861 --> 09:56.829
- Okay, I got to go find
some place hard to lie down.

09:57.732 --> 09:58.597
Oh.

09:58.733 --> 10:00.199
[flatulence noises continue]

10:00.335 --> 10:02.335
- [chuckles]

10:05.573 --> 10:07.306
- Hey, Captain,
I was looking over

10:07.441 --> 10:10.109
your list again
and I saw "en-dive."

10:10.244 --> 10:11.577
- You mean "ahn-deev"?

10:11.713 --> 10:12.712
- I always thought
it was "en-dive."

10:12.846 --> 10:14.780
- What's endive?
- Bitter lettuce.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.649
- It's pronounced "ahn-deev."
Okay?

10:17.651 --> 10:20.119
Comes from the Latin word
"ahn-deev-ion,"

10:20.254 --> 10:21.587
which means "angry seagrass."

10:21.589 --> 10:23.455
And it is not bitter
when I make it.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.924
- Well, all the things
that you want,

10:25.059 --> 10:28.460
maybe you want to pitch in
to the fund-ue.

10:28.596 --> 10:31.863
- Tomaso's tomatoes?
Okay, that's a big no.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.465
- Ah, that is a request
straight from chief.

10:33.601 --> 10:35.000
That's the base
for his Bolognese.

10:35.136 --> 10:37.336
- Okay, he may be chief,
but I'm chef,

10:37.471 --> 10:39.538
so I'm in charge
of the ingredients.

10:39.673 --> 10:44.009
And his Bolognese
is a big fat no-lognese!

10:44.011 --> 10:46.812
[chuckles]
You see what I did?

10:46.814 --> 10:49.081
Oh, this is
a super unhealthy list.

10:49.083 --> 10:52.884
Come on, you don't need six
different kinds of chips, okay?

10:52.886 --> 10:57.223
No, you guys can just share the
family size of the Hot Cheezos.

10:57.358 --> 10:59.225
Am I forgetting anything else?
I think this is it.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.693
Oh, I know what I'm forgetting.
One thing, there is one thing.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.630
Oh!
[chuckles]

11:04.632 --> 11:06.832
I don't need to write
that down anymore.

11:06.968 --> 11:08.434
Check.

11:08.569 --> 11:11.303
Okay, this list
is officially sealed.

11:11.439 --> 11:13.372
Can we do something
other than the Hot Cheezos?

11:13.507 --> 11:15.240
I don't think my dad
will go for that.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.842
The dust always burns his gums.

11:16.978 --> 11:18.844
- Actually, I'm in
on the Hot Cheezos.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.914
It might be nice to feel
a different kind of pain.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.349
Oh, God.

11:25.653 --> 11:27.386
- Damn it. Come on.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.988
[knock at door]
- Hey, Chief.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.590
- Hey, Ikey, come on in.
Have a seat.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.725
- Nice. Are you working
on something there?

11:33.727 --> 11:35.327
- Yeah, I'm trying to get
this door--

11:35.329 --> 11:36.595
oh, you all right?

11:36.730 --> 11:39.265
- Yeah, just messing around.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.533
I'm just fooling around.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.935
I used to have one of these.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.538
Just gotta--ohh!

11:46.540 --> 11:47.673
Ah, man.

11:47.809 --> 11:49.675
- You okay?
You seem a little tense.

11:49.677 --> 11:52.411
- Just a little nervous.
I think you make me nervous.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.946
Maybe it's the white shirt.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.815
- Yeah, well, I would say,
I'll take it off.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.950
But I kind of like it.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.085
Yeah.
Okay, what do you got?

12:00.221 --> 12:03.489
- Okay, so...

12:03.625 --> 12:07.026
Frenchie is taking everything
you want off the grocery list.

12:07.161 --> 12:08.294
- Really?

12:08.429 --> 12:10.963
- And Hoser has been pissing
in the shower constantly

12:11.098 --> 12:13.098
because Lucy doesn't
walk him at all.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.366
- For real?

12:14.368 --> 12:15.835
- Permission to speak freely
for a second?

12:15.970 --> 12:17.036
- Yeah.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.704
- This whole feeding you
information thing

12:18.840 --> 12:20.706
just makes me
a little uncomfortable.

12:20.842 --> 12:24.510
You know, I feel like
my heart's racing all the time.

12:24.646 --> 12:27.179
The hand job is really hard.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.114
- The hand job, that's
the toughest job there is.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.782
- I feel like they know
something, you know,

12:30.918 --> 12:32.251
when I'm walking by,
and I'm like I think they're

12:32.386 --> 12:34.119
looking at me like they know
I'm up to something.

12:34.255 --> 12:35.921
- Don't worry, you'll get used
to playing both sides.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.657
- I did.
In the meantime,

12:37.791 --> 12:40.392
make the Bolognese happen.
I believe in you, Ike.

12:40.394 --> 12:42.862
- I'll get out of here.

12:42.997 --> 12:46.465
[grunting]

12:46.600 --> 12:48.868
I always mess around in these.

12:49.003 --> 12:50.936
[grunting]
Just fooling around.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.272
- You want me to drive?
- No, I will.

12:53.407 --> 12:55.741
I feel like if I practice
changing lanes really quickly,

12:55.877 --> 12:58.010
I'll be able
to get to level 17.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.746
And just...

13:00.882 --> 13:05.551
getting that piece
right here.

13:05.687 --> 13:07.019
Here.

13:07.021 --> 13:08.688
It's always the square ones.
Turn--

13:08.822 --> 13:10.155
- Hey, Granny.
- Hmm?

13:10.291 --> 13:12.224
- I don't think it's safe
for you to drive.

13:12.226 --> 13:15.427
- Yeah, you're probably right.
I want to play my Blockazoid.

13:15.563 --> 13:17.363
- Okay.

13:17.498 --> 13:19.765
- Hey, hey, hey.
Yoink.

13:19.767 --> 13:22.034
Chief wants to add back
a couple of items.

13:22.036 --> 13:23.703
- Oh, Frenchie already
sealed the list, so--

13:23.837 --> 13:27.106
- This is for Chief.
Okay?

13:27.241 --> 13:30.175
- Tomaso's tomato sauce.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.512
- You know, Frenchie added
a bunch of things to this...

13:32.646 --> 13:34.113
- Ground beef.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.248
- List already without
kicking into the fund.

13:36.384 --> 13:37.917
So I can't add all this stuff.

13:38.052 --> 13:39.585
- A lot of this stuff
we do not need.

13:39.721 --> 13:41.587
Like butter cream.
No.

13:41.589 --> 13:43.255
- Well, no, no,
we need the Fresca,

13:43.257 --> 13:44.990
and we need
the crunchy peanut butter.

13:45.126 --> 13:47.126
People are gonna be pissed.
- Hey, don't worry about it.

13:47.261 --> 13:50.662
As long as Chief gets what
he wants, we're gonna be fine.

13:50.798 --> 13:52.664
Okay?
Hurry up.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.333
[stomach grumbles]

13:54.468 --> 13:56.802
- My stomach hurts already.

14:01.475 --> 14:03.743
- Banana chips?
You didn't get bananas?

14:03.877 --> 14:05.745
- They were all old.
- I need the potassium, Andy.

14:05.879 --> 14:09.014
- You guys made fun of me last
time for buying overripe fruit!

14:09.016 --> 14:11.016
- No Marshmallow Fluff?
- That got crossed off.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.085
- By whom?
- Perfect timing.

14:13.087 --> 14:15.955
- Now I can get started
on my velouté.

14:16.090 --> 14:16.956
- What?

14:17.091 --> 14:19.291
- Where's my buttercream?
- No.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.093
- My whipped cream,
my sour cream?

14:21.228 --> 14:24.363
And where is the breast
of duck that I asked for?

14:24.498 --> 14:25.831
- How about some ground beef?

14:25.967 --> 14:27.366
You can make something
with this, right?

14:27.501 --> 14:29.435
- You bought sale meat?
Are you kidding me?

14:29.570 --> 14:31.771
It's got a sticker right there
that says sale meat.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.774
I don't cook
with sale meat, bro, okay?

14:34.909 --> 14:37.709
I sealed the list
with a kiss.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.379
Can't unseal
my sealed kiss list.

14:40.514 --> 14:42.381
- I unsealed it.

14:42.516 --> 14:44.116
Chief's orders.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.852
He wanted Bolognese,
I unsealed it.

14:46.854 --> 14:48.654
- Look at the balls
on you, huh, bud?

14:48.790 --> 14:50.189
- Yeah, I did it.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.992
- Well, guess what, I'm not
making Bolognese tonight.

14:53.127 --> 14:55.260
In fact, I'm not
gonna make anything.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.395
- That's fine.

14:56.530 --> 14:58.330
- You are there,
big bald cowboy.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.065
- What's that?
- You're gonna knock stuff

15:00.201 --> 15:01.801
off my list,
you're gonna make dinner.

15:01.936 --> 15:03.335
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:03.471 --> 15:05.137
- Cap, don't have Ike
make dinner, please.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.872
- The only thing he can make
is sloppy joes.

15:07.008 --> 15:09.541
- I'm Captain
and I'm deciding tonight.

15:09.543 --> 15:11.743
Crystal is gonna cook.

15:11.879 --> 15:13.212
- Hey, Chief.

15:13.347 --> 15:15.947
- Granny, you do that
ambulance inventory?

15:15.949 --> 15:18.484
- Granny.
Granfield.

15:18.620 --> 15:20.953
[beeping]
- Hello.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.954
- Row's complete.
- Hey, Chief.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.624
Andy messed up
the shopping list.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.826
And now Frenchie won't cook,
and he's ordered Ike to cook.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.427
- No, listen to me right now.
Listen to me.

15:28.562 --> 15:29.629
- I tried to text you--

15:29.763 --> 15:31.030
- Captain to captain.
I'm the captain.

15:31.165 --> 15:33.965
This is my crew.
Tonight, Ike cooks dinner.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.302
- Okay, can you--
- He's captain, it's his call.

15:36.304 --> 15:37.837
- Bam!
- Wait. Wait, no, no.

15:37.971 --> 15:41.106
- Ike, it's his crew.
- In your face.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.242
Boom!
[Hoser whimpers]

15:43.377 --> 15:45.444
- Someone take care
of this dog.

15:45.579 --> 15:46.978
- [barks]
all: Not it.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.114
- Oh, my God, you guys
are driving me crazy.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.982
- Hey, hey, hey.
Hang on a second.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.985
What--what's going on?

15:53.987 --> 15:55.787
- What's going on
is I'm going in my office

15:55.789 --> 15:57.189
to finish the Baker Report.

15:57.325 --> 15:59.325
- What about the hand job?
I thought--

15:59.327 --> 16:01.126
- You're not gonna get
to finish the hand job.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.929
- What is happening right--
- This is so weird.

16:03.931 --> 16:06.198
Now it's like
we have two uptight dads.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.467
- Yeah.
- Dads are the worst.

16:08.602 --> 16:10.069
- I'm right here.

16:10.204 --> 16:14.206
Hey, did Andy at least
remember the Hot Cheezos?

16:14.208 --> 16:15.607
- Oh.

16:15.743 --> 16:17.409
Yes.
Thank you.

16:17.545 --> 16:20.479
[thunder rumbles]

16:20.614 --> 16:21.681
- [groans]

16:21.815 --> 16:24.116
[laughter]

16:26.554 --> 16:28.654
[groaning]

16:30.624 --> 16:32.692
[laughter]
