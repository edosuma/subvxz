00:02.291 --> 00:04.500
(strained) I... can...

00:04.583 --> 00:05.959
do... this.

00:06.041 --> 00:09.333
No... you... can't!

00:10.625 --> 00:12.583
Ahh.

00:12.667 --> 00:14.709
Come on, man, don't let it get you down.

00:14.792 --> 00:18.208
Just because you can't even do one chin-up
doesn't make you any less of a man.

00:18.291 --> 00:21.125
I know that. And I do not need
to prove my masculinity.

00:21.208 --> 00:24.250
My abundant forest of armpit hair
more than proves that.

00:29.166 --> 00:30.875
Okay. First of all,

00:30.959 --> 00:33.792
stop showing me that. It's weird.

00:33.875 --> 00:36.291
And secondly,
everybody knows that it's fake.

00:37.625 --> 00:41.041
Give that back. It's expensive!
I ordered it from the Philippines.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.208
And I'm not concerned about looking manly.

00:45.291 --> 00:48.542
Mr. Payton told me I was
on my way to getting a B in phys ed.

00:48.625 --> 00:50.041
I've never gotten a B in my life.

00:50.125 --> 00:51.458
Neither have I.

00:51.542 --> 00:52.959
Because you get C's and D's.

00:53.041 --> 00:55.083
And F's. Don't forget F's.

00:59.250 --> 01:02.000
(grunting)

01:02.083 --> 01:04.291
This is impossible.
Nobody can climb a rope.

01:10.375 --> 01:12.625
(bell rings)

01:14.333 --> 01:16.375
I knew I left my bell somewhere.

01:16.458 --> 01:17.959
(ringing)

01:21.667 --> 01:22.834
(man) Okay, yo.

lifting hundreds of pounds.

02:18.375 --> 02:20.291
Who's manly now?

02:20.375 --> 02:23.083
Incognito. He's doin' all the work.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.166
(alarm blaring)

02:30.250 --> 02:35.166
Hey. It's the alien superhero who
can weave unbreakable spider webs!

02:35.250 --> 02:37.625
-What's her name again?
-Arachnia.

02:37.709 --> 02:40.083
But on her home planet
some of the local newscasters

02:40.166 --> 02:42.291
call her Arrrrrrachnia.

02:43.959 --> 02:46.291
Anyway, a villain tried to steal her eggs.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.542
What? That's insane!

02:48.625 --> 02:51.375
You don't steal eggs.
You borrow them from a neighbor,

02:51.417 --> 02:53.500
then you never pay them back,
then it gets awkward

02:53.583 --> 02:55.333
and you hope that they move.

02:55.417 --> 02:59.041
That's true. I've had to move twice
because of that.

02:59.792 --> 03:01.834
But I'm talking about her embryonic eggs.

03:01.917 --> 03:03.333
Arachnia's pregnant.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.166
(monitors beep)

03:05.250 --> 03:06.542
Her vital signs are dropping.

03:06.625 --> 03:08.083
Ready the pre-natal ionic scanner!

03:19.125 --> 03:20.208
What the heck?

03:22.750 --> 03:24.917
Arachnia must be too
weak to carry her eggs,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.792
so the embryonic sac latched
onto the nearest warm-blooded individual.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.875
Someone get this thing off of me!

03:30.959 --> 03:34.291
I would, but then you'd look
so much less funny.

03:35.792 --> 03:37.542
Stop! You'll damage the eggs.

03:37.625 --> 03:41.291
Plus, the egg sac has formed
a mind-body link to your brain.

03:41.375 --> 03:43.000
So if you try to remove it,

03:43.083 --> 03:46.750
the pain you'd feel
would be "excrrrrutiating."

03:46.834 --> 03:48.333
I love rolling R's!

03:49.250 --> 03:51.709
I can't have an egg sac attached to me.

03:51.792 --> 03:52.792
I look ridiculous!

03:56.917 --> 03:58.667
Speaking of looking ridiculous,

03:58.750 --> 04:00.834
you dropped your armpit toupees.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.166
Also, I have a bunch of tests tomorrow.

04:04.250 --> 04:06.166
How can I go to school
with this attached to me?

04:06.250 --> 04:08.667
I'm sorry, Oliver,
but there's no other choice.

04:08.750 --> 04:11.959
You have to be the host for the next
few days until the eggs hatch.

04:12.041 --> 04:16.750
Wait. So Oliver is basically
gonna become a mother?

04:16.834 --> 04:20.166
Wow. I did not think
you could get any less manly.

04:21.458 --> 04:23.625
Oliver, don't listen to Kaz.

04:23.709 --> 04:26.667
You should feel proud to help
a superhero with such a precious task.

04:26.750 --> 04:30.959
And it suits you.
I mean, you're positively glowing.

04:31.041 --> 04:32.208
Aww.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.709
Ohhh.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.750
Uncle Horace. Are you okay?

04:46.834 --> 04:49.667
(crying) Yes, I just have
a little something in my eye.

04:49.750 --> 04:52.208
Tears. Lots and lots of tears.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.250
Because I'm crying.

04:54.959 --> 04:56.250
Well, what's wrong?

04:56.333 --> 04:58.375
Well, for one thing,
you caught me crying...

04:59.834 --> 05:03.333
but also, Dr. Bridges
sent me an email this morning

05:03.417 --> 05:05.667
saying she wants to shut down
Mighty Med forever.

05:05.750 --> 05:08.333
What? No, that's terrible!

05:08.417 --> 05:10.375
Did she give a reason?

05:10.458 --> 05:13.000
Is it because you
broke up with her via text?

05:14.166 --> 05:17.250
No. I would never
break up with someone via text.

05:17.375 --> 05:18.750
I'm a romantic.

05:18.834 --> 05:20.875
I broke up with her via skywriting.

05:23.083 --> 05:24.750
But that's not the reason.

05:25.458 --> 05:29.667
I've heard rumors about plans to open
a new superhero hospital in New York.

05:29.750 --> 05:33.417
What? You can't let Dr. Bridges
close Mighty Med!

05:33.500 --> 05:35.792
So many amazing things
happen here. Like the time

05:35.875 --> 05:37.834
the air vent got
a piece of paper stuck in it

05:37.917 --> 05:39.875
and it made a whistling noise like this:

05:39.959 --> 05:42.000
Ooooohhhh...

05:42.083 --> 05:46.709
Actually, I think it was a higher-pitched
whistle, like this: Eeeeeeee...

05:46.792 --> 05:50.000
So, like this? Eeeeee...

05:50.083 --> 05:55.041
(both) Eeeeee...

05:55.125 --> 05:55.959
Anyway...

05:57.250 --> 06:00.291
Horace, you need to tell Dr. Bridges
to come to Mighty Med

06:00.375 --> 06:03.417
so she can see firsthand
all the important work that we do here.

06:03.500 --> 06:06.083
I wish I could, but she absolutely refuses

06:06.166 --> 06:07.834
to ever step foot in here again.

06:07.917 --> 06:09.667
To be fair, the last time she was here

06:09.750 --> 06:11.917
she was almost eaten alive by a man-shark.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.166
She was fine.

06:13.250 --> 06:15.458
I said almost eaten alive!

06:18.125 --> 06:20.834
Wait. What if we make
a video that highlights

06:20.917 --> 06:23.667
all the great things about Mighty Med,
and send it to Dr. Bridges?

06:24.750 --> 06:26.208
That's a terrific idea.

06:27.041 --> 06:29.291
A video would be a way
to demonstrate how unique

06:29.375 --> 06:31.542
and important we are
to the superhero world.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.834
And I've always wanted to make a movie...

06:33.917 --> 06:36.792
about me, produced by me,

06:36.875 --> 06:38.083
and starring me!

06:39.834 --> 06:42.041
Well, the two of you can also be in it...

06:42.125 --> 06:43.709
to talk about me.

06:45.583 --> 06:48.917
Well, can I tell the story
about how I caught you crying?

06:49.750 --> 06:50.834
You're out of the movie!

06:57.166 --> 07:00.083
Oliver, come on, already.
Get it over with.

07:00.166 --> 07:01.208
(Oliver) I don't want to.

07:01.291 --> 07:02.750
Dude, you wanted

07:02.834 --> 07:05.166
to hide your condition,
and I hid your condition.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.375
(Oliver) Fine.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.917
This is never going to work.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.375
People are going to ask questions.

07:14.458 --> 07:17.458
Yeah, like,
"Why is that Santa Claus so mopey?"

07:19.792 --> 07:21.500
Ah-choo!

07:23.542 --> 07:26.834
Are you wearing your armpit toupees
as your mustache?

07:28.458 --> 07:31.709
I paid a lot for these,
and I intend to get my money's worth.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.917
I don't want to go into school like this.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Isn't there any other way
I can hide my stomach?

07:37.083 --> 07:39.792
Stop worrying.
No one will even notice you.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.583
They're too concerned about themselves.

07:41.667 --> 07:44.125
(Gus) Oliver,
why are you dressed like that?

07:46.709 --> 07:49.667
I can't believe
we're wearing the same outfit!

07:49.750 --> 07:51.375
This is so embarrassing.

07:53.083 --> 07:54.875
One of us is going to have to change.

07:54.959 --> 07:57.917
Uh, well, I-I can't, because...

07:58.000 --> 08:01.959
I know why. Because you're expecting...

08:03.333 --> 08:05.250
me to change!

08:05.333 --> 08:06.750
Well, it's not going to happen.

08:07.917 --> 08:09.208
Stop it!

08:10.417 --> 08:13.041
Wait. I think I figured it out.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.917
Oliver, you're having alien babies...

08:17.166 --> 08:19.917
will be the first line
of the sci-fi novel I'm writing!

08:21.458 --> 08:25.000
Okay. Only seven more hours to go.

08:27.792 --> 08:31.583
Here. Use my phone
to film the video for Dr. Bridges.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.208
And make sure to get my good side.

08:33.291 --> 08:35.542
What side is that? My backside!

08:40.750 --> 08:42.000
Hello.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.000
I'm Dr. Horace Diaz,

08:44.083 --> 08:46.583
here to demonstrate
some of the groundbreaking,

08:46.667 --> 08:50.041
cutting edge technology
we use here at Mighty Med.

08:50.125 --> 08:53.125
This is a giant shrinking ray.

08:53.208 --> 08:55.041
And this...

08:55.125 --> 08:57.041
is a tiny enlarging ray,

08:57.125 --> 08:59.542
which we use
to turn the tiny shrinking ray

08:59.625 --> 09:01.667
into the giant shrinking ray.

09:03.375 --> 09:06.583
And what does this machine
that regrows ears do?

09:08.208 --> 09:10.166
This machine regrows ears.

09:11.709 --> 09:14.875
But it's still in the testing stage.
Hey, Dennis.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.083
I don't know what you're so upset about.

09:20.166 --> 09:24.000
I mean, now you're an ear, ear,
ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.291
Why don't you tell us what this is?

09:30.375 --> 09:31.625
That's a countertop.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.250
This. What is this?

09:36.959 --> 09:39.875
This is an infrared scalpel.

09:39.959 --> 09:42.333
It can slice cleanly and instantly through

09:42.417 --> 09:45.250
even the most impenetrable
material in the universe,

09:45.333 --> 09:47.750
the roast beef from the cafeteria.

09:53.750 --> 09:54.583
Mmm.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.875
And it's extremely safe.

09:57.959 --> 10:00.959
In fact, there's a button on it
that prevents it from accidentally firing.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.792
I told you we should have rehearsed.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.625
Stop filming!

10:11.750 --> 10:14.125
I'm so sorry that happened.

10:14.208 --> 10:17.458
Can I make it up to you with a free ear?

10:26.875 --> 10:28.583
Ohh...

10:28.667 --> 10:31.417
my back hurts, my feet hurt,

10:31.500 --> 10:34.625
and I've never been
so hungry in my entire life.

10:34.709 --> 10:36.792
I need a snack.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.625
What? I'm eating for 400.

11:00.083 --> 11:01.083
Ha.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.250
Uhhh!

11:06.083 --> 11:08.917
That's the saddest thing I've ever seen.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.208
Do it again!

11:12.542 --> 11:14.667
(device beeping)

11:14.750 --> 11:16.000
Who are you?

11:16.083 --> 11:17.000
I am Hunter!

11:17.083 --> 11:18.750
A notorious bounty hunter

11:18.834 --> 11:21.041
known throughout the seven galaxies!

11:21.125 --> 11:23.208
Well, our galaxy must not be one of them

11:23.291 --> 11:25.291
because I've never heard of you.

11:26.458 --> 11:29.542
And you're a bounty hunter named Hunter?

11:29.625 --> 11:31.625
And my last name is Bounty!

11:31.709 --> 11:33.083
But that's none of your concern.

11:35.083 --> 11:39.375
My tracking device has detected
the egg sac of Arachnia.

11:39.458 --> 11:41.375
Now, which one of you has it?

11:46.917 --> 11:48.208
Take a guess.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.625
I've been waiting for years to get
my hands on some arachnoid eggs.

11:52.709 --> 11:57.792
On my planet, they'd be worth
almost twelve million dollars.

11:57.875 --> 11:59.375
How much is that on Earth?

11:59.458 --> 12:01.166
Almost twelve million dollars.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.709
What don't you understand about dollars?

12:04.917 --> 12:07.625
Well, sorry. You can't take these eggs.

12:07.709 --> 12:11.041
And they're fused to me,
so looks like you're out of luck.

12:11.125 --> 12:14.583
Then I guess I'll have to twist
your head off like a bottle cap

12:14.667 --> 12:15.917
and then take 'em!

12:16.000 --> 12:17.208
Okay, hold on a second.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.375
So your name's Hunter Bounty?

12:30.709 --> 12:31.834
You better back off.

12:31.917 --> 12:35.625
This store was owned by villains
and most of these weapons are real!

12:41.291 --> 12:43.083
Okay, that one was wasn't real. But...

12:44.625 --> 12:45.750
this one is!

12:50.250 --> 12:52.875
Okay, that one wasn't real either.
But...

12:53.834 --> 12:55.208
(zaps)

12:55.291 --> 12:57.083
That one's definitely real.

12:59.458 --> 13:01.625
And now for my prize.

13:03.291 --> 13:04.792
Stop or I'll shoot...

13:06.000 --> 13:08.125
is what I would say if I had my camera.

13:08.208 --> 13:09.625
Beat it, kid.

13:09.709 --> 13:11.333
Don't move! You're surrounded...

13:12.291 --> 13:14.834
by beauty, if you open your eyes to it.

13:15.750 --> 13:16.792
Arrgghh!

13:18.166 --> 13:20.125
You'll never get away with this!

13:20.208 --> 13:22.875
Is the last line of my novel.

13:22.959 --> 13:24.875
Now all I need to do is write the middle

13:24.959 --> 13:26.208
and I got myself a book!

13:29.083 --> 13:30.917
I knew this video was a bad plan.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.709
Now we're gonna get shut down
and I'll have to get a real job,

13:33.792 --> 13:36.041
like celebrity or billionaire.

13:37.542 --> 13:40.250
Oh, stop being so dramatic.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.291
Yes, because you're terrible at it.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.250
This is how you be dramatic.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.792
I kneeew this video was a bad plaaan!

13:52.291 --> 13:54.583
You just gave me an idea.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.625
Our first video was just boring
information about Mighty Med.

13:57.709 --> 14:00.125
We need to show this place in action!

14:00.208 --> 14:02.208
You know, make it more dramatic.

14:02.291 --> 14:04.917
Like on that TV show "Dramatic Hospital."

14:05.000 --> 14:07.834
That's a brilliant idea.

14:07.917 --> 14:10.750
A video that showcases
the real heroes here.

14:10.834 --> 14:13.250
I even have a snappy title for it.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.709
"Mighty Med: The Place Where the People
Who Save the People

14:16.792 --> 14:18.542
Who Save People, Save People."

14:19.417 --> 14:23.291
Or... just "Mighty Med in Action."

14:24.166 --> 14:25.750
That's kind of a mouthful,

14:25.834 --> 14:27.458
but sure, okay.

14:28.333 --> 14:31.709
Now, time to capture all the drama,
emotion and action

14:31.792 --> 14:33.333
that unfolds here every day.

14:39.709 --> 14:41.250
Well, every day except today.

14:42.291 --> 14:44.583
Now what? Uncle Horace,

14:44.667 --> 14:47.250
you said Dr. Bridges
needed that video by tonight.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.500
Then we'll just have
to stage the drama ourselves.

14:49.583 --> 14:53.375
Splendid! I was very big
in the theater scene

14:53.458 --> 14:55.125
back in the 1970s.

14:55.208 --> 14:58.375
This'll give me a chance
to showcase my acting chops!

14:58.458 --> 15:00.792
And my mutton chops.

15:02.375 --> 15:05.792
Alan, you pretend to have
irreparably injured your legs,

15:05.875 --> 15:07.667
and then I'll miraculously heal them,

15:07.750 --> 15:09.792
-enabling you to walk again!
-But I can't act!

15:09.875 --> 15:11.875
My pain won't be believable.

15:11.959 --> 15:14.041
Don't worry. I'll help you out.

15:14.125 --> 15:15.291
Ahhh!

15:16.875 --> 15:19.792
Ohh! My legs! I can't move!

15:19.875 --> 15:24.000
Now,
through my amazing medical technique...

15:24.083 --> 15:25.959
you are healed!

15:31.750 --> 15:33.208
Ooohhh!

15:33.291 --> 15:36.125
Ohh. My good side!

15:37.834 --> 15:42.083
At least now you can hear people
talking about you behind your back.

15:48.959 --> 15:50.709
I tracked the eggs here, Oliver.

15:50.792 --> 15:53.750
You can't hide from Hunter Bounty,
bounty hunter!

15:57.458 --> 16:00.625
I can see your giant stomach stickin' out.

16:01.458 --> 16:02.792
Maybe it's my hormones,

16:02.875 --> 16:04.750
but I find that very hurtful.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.542
No! Keep your hands off my babies!

16:27.959 --> 16:30.041
Aaahhhh!

17:02.542 --> 17:05.000
Seems like the Hunter Bounty bounty hunter

17:05.083 --> 17:07.834
has become
the Hunted Bounty bounty hunted.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.125
Yeah, that lines up.

17:12.917 --> 17:14.834
That was incredible. How'd you do that?

17:14.917 --> 17:17.583
I just took his name
and made it past tense, and then I--

17:17.667 --> 17:19.166
I was talking
about how'd you do all the moves?

17:19.250 --> 17:20.792
Oh, that? I have no idea.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.709
You know what? I was wrong.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.417
You are manly.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.125
And all it took was you as a pregnant man

17:29.208 --> 17:31.834
doing beautiful acrobatic rope maneuvers

17:31.917 --> 17:32.959
to make me see that.

17:34.041 --> 17:35.458
Thanks, Kaz.

17:35.542 --> 17:37.250
And from one man to another,

17:37.333 --> 17:38.917
I think I'm going into labor.

17:41.667 --> 17:42.792
Oh.

17:48.125 --> 17:50.083
Are the ears removed yet?

17:50.166 --> 17:52.709
Because I do not like hearing
myself go to the bathroom.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.083
Oliver's about ready to hatch these eggs.

17:58.166 --> 17:59.500
Let's boil some water, people!

17:59.583 --> 18:00.750
Why do we need boiling water?

18:00.834 --> 18:03.834
I thought we could make some ramen noodles
or something. I'm starving!

18:05.250 --> 18:07.291
The miracle of alien birth.

18:07.375 --> 18:08.375
Skylar! Start filming.

18:08.458 --> 18:11.208
This is the perfect way
to showcase Mighty Med!

18:11.291 --> 18:12.333
Aaaah!

18:12.417 --> 18:13.667
I think something's happening!

18:13.750 --> 18:15.166
Here it comes!

18:16.625 --> 18:18.792
I thought I was gonna sneeze.
Never mind, we're good.

18:20.709 --> 18:21.875
Aaah!

18:29.750 --> 18:33.291
-Are you getting this, Skylar?
-(Skylar) It's hard to tell from in here.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.291
(retching, coughing)

18:38.875 --> 18:39.959
Aaaah!

18:40.041 --> 18:42.750
Are you okay, buddy?
Is it the contractions?

18:42.834 --> 18:44.959
No! You spilled hot ramen on me!

18:46.834 --> 18:48.667
This is the contractions.

18:48.750 --> 18:51.750
Aaaaahhhh!

18:51.834 --> 18:53.500
You're almost there, Oliver.

18:53.583 --> 18:57.125
Here come four hundred
sweet little angels.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.750
Now, where's the slop bucket?

19:04.959 --> 19:06.917
Ah!

19:11.667 --> 19:14.542
Congratulations, my boy. Well done!

19:14.625 --> 19:18.083
I know! I finally learned
how to do finger glasses!

19:19.417 --> 19:21.542
Not you, Alan. Oliver!

19:24.458 --> 19:25.917
Arachnia!

19:26.000 --> 19:27.917
Looks like you're improving nicely.

19:28.041 --> 19:31.125
Pretty soon you'll be strong enough
to care for your babies yourself

19:31.208 --> 19:32.834
and take 'em back to your planet.

19:32.917 --> 19:34.667
Wait. Arachnia.

19:34.750 --> 19:36.166
I know I have to give 'em up,

19:36.250 --> 19:39.125
but can't I just hold one
or two hundred of them?

19:43.500 --> 19:44.875
Ohhh!

19:46.792 --> 19:49.083
Take 'em! Take 'em! So gross! So gross!

19:50.291 --> 19:52.625
Talk about a face
only a mother could love.

19:53.375 --> 19:55.834
I guess, but I mean,
which part's the face?

20:00.959 --> 20:03.375
Wow. The birth of those babies

20:03.458 --> 20:04.792
is exactly what our movie needed.

20:04.875 --> 20:08.166
There's no way Dr. Bridges
will close down Mighty Med now!

20:08.250 --> 20:11.834
Especially when I add
the dramatic score that I composed.

20:11.917 --> 20:13.458
Ooohh...

20:13.542 --> 20:15.875
It's more like: Oooeee...

20:15.959 --> 20:17.542
(both) Ooooeee...

20:17.625 --> 20:19.875
Anyway...

20:19.959 --> 20:22.291
-(phone chimes)
-Oh.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.083
Ugghh. Another email from Dr. Bridges.

20:26.166 --> 20:27.542
More bad news?

20:28.291 --> 20:31.125
Heh. It seems I may have misread

20:31.208 --> 20:33.375
Dr. Bridges' earlier email.

20:33.458 --> 20:37.375
She wasn't considering
shutting down Mighty Med forever,

20:37.458 --> 20:40.959
she was considering
shutting it down for Easter.

20:41.041 --> 20:43.417
Heh heh. Ah...

20:43.500 --> 20:44.458
funny mix-up, huh?

20:47.959 --> 20:52.333
I cannot believe he put
us through all this, and now--

20:52.417 --> 20:53.959
Are you talking about me behind my back?

20:55.250 --> 20:57.750
Now I wish I hadn't had
my butt ears removed!

21:02.959 --> 21:05.542
(theme music plays)

21:27.000 --> 21:28.375
(boing)

21:31.792 --> 21:33.041
(boy) Yes!
