'Our story began with Miss Rebecca
Sharp's escape from the schoolroom,

01:08.033 --> 01:12.032
'her attempt to capture the heart of
her new best friend's brother...'

01:12.033 --> 01:13.033
Miss Sharp.

01:13.034 --> 01:15.032
'..A fate worse than death...'
Governess?

01:15.033 --> 01:18.032
'And so, an old house,
a dark night, a new master...'

01:18.033 --> 01:20.032
Who welcomes you
to his humble abode.

01:20.033 --> 01:23.032
'..And, yes! A handsome hero.'

01:23.033 --> 01:25.032
Tonight, marvel as little Becky
charms her way

01:25.033 --> 01:28.032
through darkest Hampshire
and beyond,

01:28.033 --> 01:31.032
for yes, this is Vanity Fair,

01:31.033 --> 01:33.872
a world where everyone is striving

01:33.873 --> 01:35.579
for what is not worth having.

02:29.033 --> 02:31.032
She never washed behind her ears.

02:31.033 --> 02:32.033
Liar!

02:52.553 --> 02:55.032
This is my desk.

02:55.033 --> 02:57.032
And that is Violet's.

02:57.033 --> 03:00.033
I like reading,
but she only likes animals.

03:02.033 --> 03:04.033
You may resume our education now.

03:09.033 --> 03:11.713
First,
we must register your attendance.

03:14.033 --> 03:15.092
Miss Rose Crawley?

03:18.033 --> 03:19.033
Present?

03:20.033 --> 03:21.210
Miss Violet Crawley?

03:22.033 --> 03:24.033
Present!

03:26.033 --> 03:28.032
Lord Mouse of Mousingham Hall?

03:28.033 --> 03:29.033
Present.

03:32.033 --> 03:34.033
Rebecca Sharp?

03:35.033 --> 03:36.713
Present.

03:43.033 --> 03:46.032
Remember girls,
we're all in this together.

03:46.033 --> 03:48.032
Even Lord Mouse of Mousingham Hall?

03:48.033 --> 03:49.033
Especially him.

03:53.033 --> 03:58.032
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six,

03:58.033 --> 03:59.232
cache-cache!

03:59.233 --> 04:01.033
We're playing hide and seek.

04:03.033 --> 04:06.032
Do you know,
that is my favourite game.

04:06.033 --> 04:10.033
Your brother,
up to his old tricks again.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.033
Another artful hussy, no doubt.

04:14.553 --> 04:16.033
I am never wrong.

04:18.033 --> 04:20.031
May I play, Mademoiselle?

04:20.033 --> 04:22.031
No, sir, you may not.

04:22.033 --> 04:23.033
But it's Rawdon!

04:23.034 --> 04:25.032
No, I've been dismissed,
little sister.

04:25.033 --> 04:28.032
And a gentleman must always
bow to the command of a lady.

04:28.033 --> 04:32.033
But... will you be
my secret messenger?

04:34.033 --> 04:35.033
I believe your charming governess

04:35.034 --> 04:37.393
dropped a picture
of me and my brother.

04:38.713 --> 04:41.032
Give it back to her,
when she's not looking.

04:41.033 --> 04:44.713
Now, blow me a kiss
to keep me going till dinner.

04:51.713 --> 04:54.361
Father says she comes
very highly recommended.

04:55.033 --> 04:58.032
From Miss Pinkerton's Academy
for Young Ladies?

04:58.033 --> 05:01.032
A breeding ground
for fortune-hunting jades.

05:01.033 --> 05:02.033
Perhaps in your day.

05:02.034 --> 05:04.032
Don't try to be funny, Bute.

05:04.033 --> 05:07.033
Sept, huit, neuf.

05:08.033 --> 05:10.269
Are you still here?
Go on! Cache-cache!

05:11.233 --> 05:16.072
Vingt et un, vingt-deux,
vingt-trois,

05:16.073 --> 05:19.072
vingt-quatre, vingt-cinq,

05:19.073 --> 05:25.032
vingt-six, vingt-sept,
vingt-huit, vingt-neuf...

05:25.033 --> 05:26.033
Good morning, miss!

05:26.033 --> 05:27.033
...trente.

05:29.033 --> 05:31.033
I'm coming!

05:36.033 --> 05:38.032
You're frightening my puppy!

05:38.033 --> 05:39.033
Desist!

05:42.033 --> 05:44.032
Climb aboard, come on.

05:44.033 --> 05:46.032
You see this avenue?

05:46.033 --> 05:47.232
It's a mile long.

05:47.233 --> 05:49.032
It's very fine.

05:49.033 --> 05:50.033
Fine be damned.

05:50.034 --> 05:54.872
£6,000 worth of timber in them there
trees, and you know what that means?

05:54.873 --> 05:57.032
It means that you're very rich.

05:57.033 --> 05:59.032
It means, Madam,
that every half-arsed brigand

05:59.033 --> 06:01.872
in the county
thinks it's worth his while

06:01.873 --> 06:03.712
to try it on
with Sir Pitt Crawley.

06:03.713 --> 06:06.032
Poachers, crooked agents
and bankrupt tenants,

06:06.033 --> 06:08.032
I put my lawyers on the lot of them.

06:08.033 --> 06:10.873
My poor dear Papa
was much given to the law.

06:12.033 --> 06:15.072
I've won and lost more lawsuits
than any man in England.

06:15.073 --> 06:17.392
He had me read so many
of his hopeless cases

06:17.393 --> 06:19.872
that I've become quite the expert,
so...

06:19.873 --> 06:21.552
Get up there, get up, get up!

06:21.553 --> 06:24.032
Get out of my damned way!

06:24.033 --> 06:26.073
Knock him down, Papa, kill him!

06:31.033 --> 06:33.032
Crooked agents or bankrupt tenants?

06:33.033 --> 06:35.873
Him? Him's my son and heir.

06:37.033 --> 06:38.072
Grr!

06:38.073 --> 06:40.426
He, HE'S my son and heir,
not... not him.

06:42.033 --> 06:44.032
And her
is my prune-faced daughter-in-law.

06:44.033 --> 06:45.073
Aunt Martha.

06:46.553 --> 06:49.032
I suppose rich baronets,
with even more lawsuits than trees,

06:49.033 --> 06:51.032
do not need to be as careful
with grammar

06:51.033 --> 06:53.032
as poor governesses must be.

06:53.033 --> 06:55.032
If you'd like me
to look at your papers...

06:55.033 --> 06:56.033
Whoa there!

06:56.034 --> 06:59.032
You thieving little ragamuffins!

06:59.033 --> 07:02.032
I'll have the souls
out of your nasty little bodies!

07:02.033 --> 07:04.032
Come here!

07:04.033 --> 07:08.032
I'll pull every inch of skin
off your filthy little limbs!

07:08.033 --> 07:10.032
When I get my ruddy hands on you...

07:10.033 --> 07:12.032
Are you inspecting me, Miss Crawley?

07:12.033 --> 07:14.072
I am reading your mind.

07:14.073 --> 07:16.032
And what do you find there?

07:16.033 --> 07:19.032
You're thinking
that rather than be a governess,

07:19.033 --> 07:21.092
you can become a secretary instead.

07:24.033 --> 07:26.033
Well, I do like to have a plan.

07:32.033 --> 07:35.032
Bless, O Lord,
this food we are about to eat.

07:35.033 --> 07:37.072
Girls, stop it.

07:37.073 --> 07:41.552
And we pray to thee, O Lord,
that it may be good for our souls,

07:41.553 --> 07:43.552
more than our vile bodies.

07:43.553 --> 07:45.032
Amen.

07:45.033 --> 07:50.032
And if there be any poor beggar,
hungry or thirsty,

07:50.033 --> 07:53.032
walking along the road,
O Lord, send him hither.

07:53.033 --> 07:55.033
Amen.

07:56.553 --> 08:00.872
And when it falls to us sinners
to pass from time to eternity...

08:00.873 --> 08:02.032
Amen!

08:02.033 --> 08:04.032
Amen.

08:04.033 --> 08:06.552
Will she be kind to my girls?

08:06.553 --> 08:10.033
Goodness, Mama!
Your fichu's gone adrift!

08:11.033 --> 08:14.032
Her's my wife,
the second Lady Crawley, Becky.

08:14.033 --> 08:17.032
She's even dafter than the first one
that died in your bed.

08:17.033 --> 08:19.712
That was my beloved mother, sir!

08:19.713 --> 08:22.392
Mind you, she's not as stuck up.

08:22.393 --> 08:24.032
I'll give her that.

08:24.033 --> 08:27.032
Mouton au navet, sir.
Lovely!

08:27.033 --> 08:31.032
Mutton and turnips.
Again.

08:31.033 --> 08:34.032
They will be jealous
in the barracks.

08:34.033 --> 08:38.032
I believe it is the custom, Captain,
in decent society,

08:38.033 --> 08:40.032
to call the dish
as I have called it.

08:40.033 --> 08:42.328
Mutton is mutton
and turnips is turnips.

08:43.033 --> 08:45.032
I killed that there sheep
with my own hands!

08:45.033 --> 08:46.033
Here, smell 'em.

08:46.034 --> 08:49.032
Eurgh! Smell it!
I do hope that you won't be put off

08:49.033 --> 08:52.033
by our family's country ways,
Miss Sharp.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.032
Not at all, Captain Crawley.

08:55.033 --> 08:57.563
I find city people so shallow
and heartless.

08:58.393 --> 08:59.713
Don't you?

09:10.033 --> 09:12.232
I'm so glad of your visit,
Captain Dobbin.

09:12.233 --> 09:14.032
I hope you might advise.

09:14.033 --> 09:17.563
I know my little worries
are the least of his concern, but...

09:20.393 --> 09:22.552
Captain Dobbin.

09:22.553 --> 09:26.033
I live in fear that George
may be called away to fight.

09:28.033 --> 09:29.092
The war is over...

09:30.033 --> 09:31.033
...and we won.

09:32.033 --> 09:34.033
He never answers my letters.

09:35.073 --> 09:37.033
Perhaps I write too much.

09:39.033 --> 09:41.033
He should be glad of every word.

09:47.033 --> 09:49.032
Give it to my George,

09:49.033 --> 09:51.032
with all of my love,
wherever you find him.

09:51.033 --> 09:53.151
I will write another letter
to Becky.

09:54.033 --> 09:56.033
How I hope she is among friends!

10:00.033 --> 10:04.032
"Vanity, vanity, all is vanity.

10:04.033 --> 10:06.032
"Thus the preacher's voice,

10:06.033 --> 10:10.033
"in rebuke and mockery of all the
pursuits of earthliness." Read on.

10:11.033 --> 10:14.712
"Then I saw in my dream,
that when Christian and Faithful

10:14.713 --> 10:16.032
"were got out of the wilderness,

10:16.033 --> 10:18.032
"they presently saw a town
before them."

10:18.033 --> 10:20.032
Very good. Violet?

10:20.033 --> 10:22.032
Rawdon has gone back to London.

10:22.033 --> 10:24.032
What a relief!

10:24.033 --> 10:25.033
Read on.

10:27.033 --> 10:28.392
"And the name of that town
is Vanity,

10:28.393 --> 10:32.032
"and at that town there's a fair
kept called Vanity Fair."

10:32.033 --> 10:35.033
No candles upstairs, Miss Blunt.

10:36.233 --> 10:41.032
And is Vanity Fair not a very vain,
wicked and foolish place?

10:41.033 --> 10:44.072
Full of all sorts of humbug
and falseness and pretension?

10:44.073 --> 10:45.233
No.

10:49.033 --> 10:50.033
Yes?

10:53.033 --> 10:54.233
Read on.

10:57.033 --> 11:00.032
Argh! Rules is rules, Miss Becky.

11:00.033 --> 11:02.553
You must go to bed in the dark.

11:04.073 --> 11:06.033
You pretty little hussy.

11:09.033 --> 11:13.712
I am no hussy, I'm a Montmorency,
on my mother's side.

11:13.713 --> 11:15.032
Ooh!

11:15.033 --> 11:16.033
My lady!

11:16.034 --> 11:18.713
We are honoured.
Bow down, young Horrocks.

11:21.033 --> 11:22.033
Now, unless you wish
for Horrocks here

11:22.034 --> 11:24.152
to come for the candle
every night...

11:25.033 --> 11:27.033
...mind and be in bed at ten.

11:34.033 --> 11:38.032
I took the liberty of making a start
on your leases and tenancies,

11:38.033 --> 11:39.033
and had planned, in the morning,

11:39.034 --> 11:41.393
to suggest how more money
might be made.

11:42.233 --> 11:44.713
Alas, quite impossible in the dark.

11:47.033 --> 11:49.552
Get her a candle, you dolt!

11:49.553 --> 11:52.033
Get her a whole box of candles!

12:03.670 --> 12:07.669
Gammon. Every time
she creeps up on me from nowhere.

12:07.670 --> 12:10.670
That is a godless amusement
for a young female.

12:12.670 --> 12:13.670
In France, before the revolution,

12:13.671 --> 12:16.029
it was thought
quite an aristocratic game.

12:16.030 --> 12:20.669
Surely the schoolroom is where
a governess should spend her days.

12:20.670 --> 12:23.669
A secretary's day
is best spent by her master's side.

12:23.670 --> 12:25.870
A female cannot be a secretary!

12:27.670 --> 12:31.729
Whilst governess plays at secretary,
what, pray, is her pupil reading?

12:31.731 --> 12:33.709
Rose is reading a French novel,

12:33.710 --> 12:36.669
and learning the habit of quiet,
scholarly reflection.

12:36.670 --> 12:41.029
And where is Violet?
Engaged in the study of nature.

12:41.030 --> 12:44.501
In which endeavour it may be
good for our souls to join her.

12:46.670 --> 12:50.869
The only reason I put up with him
and his horrible wife is I has to.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.189
Don't tell me you owe
your son and heir money too!

12:53.190 --> 12:56.670
Er, for the lawsuits,
and the horses, and...

12:58.670 --> 13:01.189
We should quietly drop the case
against the crooked agent.

13:01.190 --> 13:02.669
Now, wait a moment...

13:02.670 --> 13:04.669
As he's got no money to settle it,
don't argue, Sir Pitt,

13:04.670 --> 13:06.669
you know I'm right.

13:06.670 --> 13:08.670
Taking charge, are we?

13:09.670 --> 13:11.669
Well you keep your little feet
under my table,

13:11.670 --> 13:14.141
you're more damn use
than any of my family.

13:14.870 --> 13:17.165
Blaggards and wastrels,
the lot of them.

13:24.670 --> 13:25.788
After you, Osborne.

13:26.670 --> 13:29.669
Stand back, Crawley,
you're up against a master.

13:29.670 --> 13:32.670
Perhaps I'll pick up some tips.

13:35.670 --> 13:37.670
Damn slippery balls!

13:39.670 --> 13:41.670
It's not really my game, either.

13:45.870 --> 13:47.670
Beginner's luck.

13:50.670 --> 13:51.788
The cue's sticking.

14:00.670 --> 14:01.670
Play again.

14:01.670 --> 14:02.670
With pleasure.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.869
Dob! Just in time!

14:08.870 --> 14:11.029
Lend me 200, will you,
there's a good fellow.

14:11.030 --> 14:13.670
Actually no, lend me four.
With me, now.

14:18.670 --> 14:19.670
Well, at least answer her letters!

14:19.671 --> 14:21.669
She writes hundreds!

14:21.670 --> 14:23.709
On and on!

14:23.710 --> 14:25.669
Don't look angry,

14:25.670 --> 14:27.189
I am very fond of Amelia,

14:27.190 --> 14:29.029
I adore her, and that sort of thing,

14:29.030 --> 14:31.669
but you and I
are supposed to be friends.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.906
You shouldn't be
always telling me off.

14:35.670 --> 14:39.670
Go and comfort her, you rascal.
Buy her a little present.

14:40.870 --> 14:42.670
She's damn fond of me, I know.

14:43.670 --> 14:45.669
But hey, Dob,
where's the fun in winning a thing

14:45.670 --> 14:47.729
if you've never had to work for it?

14:50.670 --> 14:52.670
Do something to make her happy.

14:53.670 --> 14:55.510
God knows it won't take much.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.670
Your father...
Is well, thank you, sir.

15:44.670 --> 15:47.670
...has ever been my closest friend.

15:48.670 --> 15:50.729
No one knows it better than I, sir.

15:51.670 --> 15:53.729
I helped him set up his business...

15:54.670 --> 15:56.670
...when we were both very young.

15:58.030 --> 15:59.670
Yes, sir, I know.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.788
It's the hardest thing in the world.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.190
Friends growing cold.

16:28.670 --> 16:29.670
Amelia!

16:35.670 --> 16:36.670
George!

16:36.671 --> 16:38.669
What a lovely pin!

16:38.670 --> 16:40.670
Yeah this old thing.

16:42.030 --> 16:44.795
I shall buy you something
next time I'm in town.

16:47.350 --> 16:50.709
Imagine Mrs George Osborne
in a regimental lodging house.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.869
Or worse still,
baking in the East Indies,

16:52.870 --> 16:55.349
patronised by the Major's wife.

16:55.350 --> 16:59.029
I shouldn't mind...
if you were there.

16:59.030 --> 17:03.509
No. Amelia, I am determined,
I shall leave the army in a year.

17:03.510 --> 17:06.669
And then...
then my dear little girl

17:06.670 --> 17:10.509
shall take the place in society
to which, as my wife,

17:10.510 --> 17:12.669
she will be entitled.

17:12.670 --> 17:14.670
George... Your wife!

17:26.670 --> 17:28.029
"And so, my dear friend,

17:28.030 --> 17:30.669
"it is settled,
I shall be the happiest woman alive,

17:30.670 --> 17:33.029
"married to my love.

17:33.030 --> 17:37.670
"Married to the most gallant,
the most handsome."

17:41.670 --> 17:44.669
"How I wish such a happy ending
for you too,

17:44.670 --> 17:46.669
"darling Becky."

17:46.670 --> 17:49.349
News from a friend
who is flourishing?

17:49.350 --> 17:50.670
Always so annoying.

17:56.710 --> 18:00.669
In my day, Miss Pinkerton
ran a high-class establishment,

18:00.670 --> 18:04.509
which prepared respectable
young ladies to be wives,

18:04.510 --> 18:05.709
not secretaries.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.709
In the olden days I'm sure
everything was quite different,

18:08.710 --> 18:10.709
and much better in every way.

18:10.710 --> 18:16.669
You are too pert, Miss Blunt,
and I dare say cunning, too.

18:16.670 --> 18:19.669
Be sure I have my eye always on you.

18:19.670 --> 18:21.669
Becky!

18:21.670 --> 18:22.670
Becky!

18:22.671 --> 18:24.709
Two of the decks haven't been done!

18:24.710 --> 18:27.669
Get this house straight, damn you!

18:27.670 --> 18:29.200
And smarten yourselves up!

18:30.670 --> 18:32.669
My sister!

18:32.670 --> 18:34.669
Sir, is the lady dead?

18:34.670 --> 18:35.670
If only!

18:36.670 --> 18:38.670
She coming here.

18:43.670 --> 18:44.670
Come on.

18:47.670 --> 18:49.669
Hide, Lord Mousington, hide!

18:49.670 --> 18:51.669
No more books, no more pets!

18:51.670 --> 18:53.669
Why is everyone
so frightened of her?

18:53.670 --> 18:54.869
We love her.

18:54.870 --> 18:57.669
When she comes,
we always sew her little presents.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.669
For she is the richest lady
in the whole, wide, world,

19:00.670 --> 19:02.670
and her will is not yet written.

19:13.670 --> 19:15.669
Are you a princess in disguise?

19:15.670 --> 19:16.670
You try.

19:25.670 --> 19:27.082
Have you got a new plan?

19:28.670 --> 19:32.510
To make Aunt Matilda
fall at our feet.

19:36.670 --> 19:37.670
Again?

19:48.670 --> 19:50.669
Right!
Come on, I want somebody working!

19:50.670 --> 19:53.030
Horrid... Upstairs, now.

19:54.710 --> 19:56.670
My Lord, a carriage at the gates.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.669
My dear sister...

20:15.670 --> 20:18.669
The sweet smell of home.

20:18.670 --> 20:22.023
Here's one who knows which side
his damn bread's buttered!

20:28.670 --> 20:32.670
My dear Aunt,
welcome back to Queen's Crawley.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.669
May God in his glory be...

20:39.670 --> 20:41.350
No sermons!

20:43.510 --> 20:44.669
We trust your...
No scheming!

20:44.670 --> 20:46.669
Hell and damnation...

20:46.670 --> 20:48.709
No swearing!

20:48.710 --> 20:53.670
Good God, Rawdon, are we really
related to these dreadful people?

20:56.670 --> 20:58.669
Rawdon is very handsome,

20:58.670 --> 21:01.669
but awfully poor on account of
being younger than Bute.

21:01.670 --> 21:04.669
Who's horrid, but it's all right
because he's only a half brother.

21:04.670 --> 21:06.669
Rawdon's a half too.

21:06.670 --> 21:08.669
He's not! He is!
He's not! He is!

21:08.670 --> 21:10.670
Girls, don't be silly, please.

21:12.670 --> 21:16.669
Bute and Rawdon had a mama
who was related to the Binkies.

21:16.670 --> 21:18.349
The Binkies?

21:18.350 --> 21:22.669
But we only have a mama
who's an ironmonger's daughter.

21:22.670 --> 21:24.669
So? Your mama has proven
that anyone can rise

21:24.670 --> 21:26.669
to be better
than where they came from.

21:26.670 --> 21:28.670
Now you're being silly!

21:29.870 --> 21:34.669
But should one not ask,
is it not the great end of religion,

21:34.670 --> 21:37.669
and in particular,
the glory of Christianity,

21:37.670 --> 21:41.349
to extinguish
the malignant passions,

21:41.350 --> 21:43.669
to... curb the violence,

21:43.670 --> 21:45.669
to control the appetites...
Christ!

21:45.670 --> 21:47.669
On arrival
did I not make myself clear?

21:47.670 --> 21:50.669
No sermons.

21:50.670 --> 21:52.669
Well, indeed so, yes.

21:52.670 --> 21:55.669
If there is to be
no decent entertainment...

21:55.670 --> 21:57.669
Will the ladies like to withdraw?

21:57.670 --> 22:00.669
Good God, no, the company of women
is generally abominable.

22:00.670 --> 22:02.670
Rawdon, take me away.

22:08.510 --> 22:10.509
I change my will.

22:10.510 --> 22:12.669
You must do with your fortune
exactly as you wish.

22:12.670 --> 22:16.669
The Shropshire Crawleys
are even more intolerable.

22:16.670 --> 22:19.669
You're the only one of the entire
crew who is worth a fig,

22:19.670 --> 22:21.670
my darling boy.

22:30.190 --> 22:31.669
Names, remind me.

22:31.670 --> 22:32.670
Rose and Violet.

22:33.670 --> 22:37.669
Since when did you hoydens
learn to curtsy like ladies?

22:37.670 --> 22:39.350
Becky taught us.

22:48.670 --> 22:53.710
Tomorrow, Rawdon, you and I
shall discover her other talents.

23:04.192 --> 23:05.712
Jump!

23:08.962 --> 23:09.962
And jump!

23:09.963 --> 23:11.961
Left, and right.

23:11.962 --> 23:13.961
And left around the shoulder,

23:13.962 --> 23:15.961
right, left,

23:15.962 --> 23:18.962
right around the shoulder.

23:21.962 --> 23:23.961
What a pretty display.

23:23.962 --> 23:26.961
I mean to do the best by your
little sisters, Captain Crawley.

23:26.962 --> 23:29.961
He means you. Not us.

23:29.962 --> 23:33.962
My aunt requests the pleasure.
In the drawing-room.

24:09.962 --> 24:15.161
My vulgar relatives have not a
musical bone between them, my dear.

24:15.162 --> 24:18.961
You and I
are cut from superior cloth.

24:18.962 --> 24:22.482
For if music be the food of love...

24:54.962 --> 24:57.321
Gad, Miss Sharp!

24:57.322 --> 24:59.961
If merit had its just reward,

24:59.962 --> 25:02.961
Miss Sharp ought to be sitting
where you do,

25:02.962 --> 25:04.961
or indeed to be a duchess.

25:04.962 --> 25:06.961
Well, for a radical like myself,

25:06.962 --> 25:08.961
there ought to be
no duchesses at all!

25:08.962 --> 25:11.481
You can pretend you believe that,
if you like.

25:11.482 --> 25:16.962
But I consider this particular young
lady my equal in every respect.

25:18.002 --> 25:23.961
Your unmarriageable daughters, Bute,
might take a leaf from her book.

25:23.962 --> 25:26.961
A paragon, a jewel.

25:26.962 --> 25:29.802
Now, a waltz!

25:54.962 --> 25:55.962
Gong!

25:56.962 --> 25:58.962
Bang the damn gong for dinner!

26:03.002 --> 26:04.962
Rawdon!

26:06.962 --> 26:07.962
Dinner is served.

26:11.962 --> 26:14.961
Aunt Matilda,
may I have the great honour...

26:14.962 --> 26:18.961
You may not!
Becky will take me into dinner.

26:18.962 --> 26:20.961
Aunt Matilda's cushion, quick!

26:20.962 --> 26:23.162
And Rawdon shall carry my cushion.

26:26.962 --> 26:29.961
Pitt, your task is to organise
a ball in our honour.

26:29.962 --> 26:31.481
I hate balls.

26:31.482 --> 26:32.961
You hate balls.

26:32.962 --> 26:36.962
We are the only three Christians
in the county, my dears.

26:52.962 --> 26:55.961
Where the devil is my son?

26:55.962 --> 26:58.845
George is at headquarters, Papa,
I'm sure he'll...

27:05.962 --> 27:07.482
Keep still, woman.

27:11.962 --> 27:14.961
Mr George has not come in, Sir.

27:14.962 --> 27:17.961
Be damned Mr George,
am I master of this house?

27:17.962 --> 27:19.962
Dinner.

27:27.962 --> 27:30.080
Well, what are they waiting for now?

27:31.962 --> 27:34.962
Papa, grace?

27:39.962 --> 27:43.961
Holy... righteous
and everywhere present God,

27:43.962 --> 27:46.161
give us thy blessing upon this food.

27:46.162 --> 27:47.961
Amen.

27:47.962 --> 27:48.962
Yes.

27:51.962 --> 27:52.962
Soup?

27:54.162 --> 27:56.961
Skin of my teeth!
I thought I was bound to be late.

27:56.962 --> 27:58.962
You are late, sit down.

28:00.962 --> 28:03.962
How are we all?
Hungry.

28:12.802 --> 28:14.962
You look pale, Miss Sedley.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.021
It's that... bell.

28:19.482 --> 28:21.482
Just my father ringing for claret.

28:24.962 --> 28:25.962
Miss Osborne...

28:27.482 --> 28:30.130
...have I, in some way
I cannot account for...

28:30.962 --> 28:32.315
...angered your father?

28:34.162 --> 28:36.962
He was angry with George, not you.

28:39.962 --> 28:40.962
He used to be...

28:42.002 --> 28:43.162
...kinder.

28:44.962 --> 28:49.961
Given all the advantages
I never had, make good use of them.

28:49.962 --> 28:52.961
Mix with the young nobility, boy.

28:52.962 --> 28:55.962
My guineas is as good as theirs.

28:57.322 --> 28:58.961
Indeed so, sir.

28:58.962 --> 29:02.961
Though one can't carry on
with these great folks for nothing,

29:02.962 --> 29:04.161
and my purse is empty.

29:04.162 --> 29:05.961
What I want to know, son,

29:05.962 --> 29:09.962
is how you and that little thing
are carrying on?

29:10.962 --> 29:13.481
It's not hard to see.

29:13.482 --> 29:15.961
It's pretty clear we are engaged,
and so on.

29:15.962 --> 29:19.962
But why shouldn't you marry higher
than a... stockbroker's daughter?

29:21.962 --> 29:23.961
Didn't you order me to marry her?

29:23.962 --> 29:27.080
A hundred years ago,
and ain't I a good, obedient boy?

29:28.482 --> 29:30.962
People's fortunes change.

29:33.962 --> 29:35.961
I tell you in confidence,

29:35.962 --> 29:38.374
I don't like the look
of Sedley's affairs.

29:38.962 --> 29:40.641
The man is made of money.

29:40.642 --> 29:42.641
He's made of other people's money,

29:42.642 --> 29:44.962
and he's invested it unwisely.

29:49.962 --> 29:52.961
I'll see Amelia's £10,000
in advance,

29:52.962 --> 29:54.961
or there'll be no wedding.

29:54.962 --> 29:59.322
I will not have a lame-duck daughter
in my family.

30:13.322 --> 30:14.961
Half ten o'clock, and all's well.

30:14.962 --> 30:16.962
Yes, I... do hope so.

30:25.962 --> 30:27.961
She drank seven glasses
of champagne,

30:27.962 --> 30:29.961
and filthy stuff it is, too.

30:29.962 --> 30:33.481
And cherry brandy after dinner,
then Curacao with her coffee.

30:33.482 --> 30:36.642
I lay five to two
that Matilda drops in a year.

30:41.962 --> 30:45.961
If that young person is flirting
with Rawdon again,

30:45.962 --> 30:47.962
her virtue won't last the night.

31:20.002 --> 31:21.961
What's that?

31:21.962 --> 31:23.962
A false note.

31:31.962 --> 31:34.001
Relatives.

31:34.002 --> 31:35.961
Skulking!

31:35.962 --> 31:37.002
Intolerable!

31:42.482 --> 31:46.162
Come, my dear,
and let us abuse their company.

31:48.962 --> 31:51.551
I have not a true friend
in the whole family.

31:51.962 --> 31:53.962
They all want my money.

31:54.962 --> 31:57.845
Money is important
only to people without quality.

31:58.322 --> 32:03.961
What I like best is for a poor
fellow to run away with a rich girl.

32:03.962 --> 32:06.321
It's much better
the other way around,

32:06.322 --> 32:08.961
for a rich man
to marry a miller's daughter,

32:08.962 --> 32:11.139
it makes all the fine ladies
so angry.

32:11.962 --> 32:15.321
I wish some great man
would run away with you, my dear.

32:15.322 --> 32:16.961
I'm sure you're pretty enough.

32:16.962 --> 32:20.962
Lord, how I love
all foolish marriages.

32:27.962 --> 32:32.962
Between us, I have my heart set
on Rawdon running away with someone.

32:33.962 --> 32:37.961
Someone rich or someone poor?

32:37.962 --> 32:38.962
You goose!

32:38.963 --> 32:42.961
The great handsome dandy
is crippled with debts,

32:42.962 --> 32:44.961
he has not one shilling
but what I give him,

32:44.962 --> 32:48.322
not an idea in his head
beyond his horses.

32:49.642 --> 32:51.962
But he'll be rich when I'm gone.

32:55.962 --> 32:58.961
You mustn't leave yet.

32:58.962 --> 33:00.962
Well, I've only just met you...

33:13.962 --> 33:15.642
A little duchess.

33:16.962 --> 33:17.962
What an honour.

33:17.963 --> 33:19.961
I bow before you.

33:19.962 --> 33:22.961
If your aunt really means
her protestations about equality...

33:22.962 --> 33:26.198
This family is doomed,
and the country gone to the dogs.

33:29.962 --> 33:33.322
You don't mind my cigar, Miss Sharp?

33:34.642 --> 33:35.802
I love the smell.

33:36.962 --> 33:37.962
Out of doors.

33:41.962 --> 33:43.139
You ever tasted one?

34:04.962 --> 34:06.482
By Jove.

34:11.641 --> 34:15.962
What duchess would stoop to
the attentions of a mere captain?

34:17.348 --> 34:18.507
Good night, sir.

34:31.435 --> 34:34.114
She was a student of mine, yes.

34:34.114 --> 34:36.434
I have nothing to say
in Miss Sharp's disfavour.

34:36.435 --> 34:38.434
Her talents are considerable,

34:38.435 --> 34:42.434
and I cannot regret
that I received her out of charity.

34:42.435 --> 34:43.435
Charity?

34:43.436 --> 34:45.435
Her late father was a painter.

34:46.435 --> 34:47.435
Alas, he was...

34:49.435 --> 34:50.965
...several times bankrupt.

34:51.435 --> 34:53.474
You shall tell me the whole truth,
Miss Pinkerton,

34:53.475 --> 34:55.434
it will go no further.

34:55.435 --> 34:57.434
Dissemble, and I may see to it

34:57.435 --> 35:00.906
that no Hampshire girl shall grace
this establishment again.

35:02.435 --> 35:05.435
Unfortunately, he was never sober.

35:06.435 --> 35:07.954
And her mother?

35:07.955 --> 35:10.434
Represented to me
as a French countess,

35:10.435 --> 35:12.434
forced to flee
the revolutionary horrors.

35:12.435 --> 35:14.114
But in truth?

35:14.115 --> 35:15.434
A dancer.

35:15.435 --> 35:18.274
In the opera.

35:18.275 --> 35:23.434
So, you have sent my family
the spawn of a drunk and a harlot.

35:23.435 --> 35:27.435
I only sought to do my Christian
duty to an unhappy outcast girl.

35:52.635 --> 35:54.434
My dear Aunt!

35:54.435 --> 35:55.435
Rawdon!

35:55.436 --> 35:57.475
You must join us.

36:03.435 --> 36:08.434
He's a gambler, he's a drunkard,
he shot a man in a duel,

36:08.435 --> 36:11.434
and he's the villain will inherit
50,000 off Matilda.

36:11.435 --> 36:15.435
Husband, I have the whole thing
under control.

36:23.955 --> 36:25.475
Ooh, ooh.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.435
Here we are.

36:34.475 --> 36:36.434
Mama, go back to bed!

36:36.435 --> 36:38.434
I've got my green silk on.

36:38.435 --> 36:40.435
It's too big for you. Mama?

36:49.435 --> 36:52.275
Remember, I am never wrong.

36:59.635 --> 37:01.434
May I have the pleasure?

37:01.435 --> 37:04.434
You can't dance with the staff,
Sir Pitt, what would the world say?

37:04.435 --> 37:07.435
I couldn't give a brass farthing,
it's my house!

37:09.435 --> 37:12.494
Watch your feet, mind,
I haven't danced this century.

37:14.435 --> 37:16.435
I've still got it though!

37:18.435 --> 37:22.434
My father would attempt the virtue
of the kitchen cat.

37:22.435 --> 37:24.730
You don't have to worry about him,
Bute.

37:26.435 --> 37:30.612
But what if the second Lady Crawley
were to fade away to nothing at all?

37:32.115 --> 37:34.954
What if THAT
is the third Lady Crawley?

37:34.955 --> 37:36.474
My next mother!

37:36.475 --> 37:40.435
Did I not say
I have everything under control?

37:54.435 --> 37:55.634
Excuse me, father.

37:55.635 --> 37:57.435
Thank you.

38:03.435 --> 38:04.435
I tell you plainly,

38:04.436 --> 38:06.954
I do not like the look of this.

38:06.955 --> 38:09.434
Let me tell you how it goes.

38:09.435 --> 38:14.434
Rawdon will seduce her,
and she will be ruined.

38:14.435 --> 38:17.434
Meanwhile, your jealous father
will send her packing,

38:17.435 --> 38:19.434
and Matilda...

38:19.435 --> 38:23.434
...will forget all her talk
of equality in an instant.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.435
Some air, Miss Sharp?

38:29.275 --> 38:31.435
Martha, you are brilliant!

38:34.635 --> 38:37.434
No, Becky,
not so fast, not so fast,

38:37.435 --> 38:40.434
remember my old age,
or rather, don't,

38:40.435 --> 38:42.435
for there is still life in me!

38:43.435 --> 38:46.435
Gad! That hopeless old fool.

38:47.475 --> 38:50.434
He is fond of me,
how is that so amusing?

38:50.435 --> 38:53.434
I'm just giving you a fair warning,
look out, you know.

38:53.435 --> 38:56.634
Do you suppose
that I cannot defend my honour?

38:56.635 --> 39:00.434
Yes! Indeed, Gad!

39:00.435 --> 39:03.434
Do you suppose, Captain Crawley,
that I have no self-respect

39:03.435 --> 39:05.435
because I am poor and friendless?

39:07.435 --> 39:08.794
Do you think
because I'm your governess,

39:08.795 --> 39:12.434
I have not as much sense and feeling
and good breeding

39:12.435 --> 39:14.435
as you gentle folks in Hampshire?

39:15.955 --> 39:18.435
I'm a Montmorency,
and even if I weren't...

39:19.955 --> 39:23.474
...you can do this because you have
a loving father, and I have none.

39:23.475 --> 39:25.474
Miss Sharp!

39:25.475 --> 39:27.275
Rebecca!

39:28.435 --> 39:30.906
I would happily share the old boy
with you.

39:35.435 --> 39:37.435
I've never met anyone like you.

39:39.435 --> 39:42.434
You've never met anyone
without a mother, a father,

39:42.435 --> 39:43.954
or a penny to her name.

39:43.955 --> 39:46.661
I've never met anyone
with so much life in her.

39:49.115 --> 39:50.435
Gad!

39:53.435 --> 39:55.435
I wouldn't hurt you for £1,000.

40:00.955 --> 40:03.073
Then you don't mean to ruin me, sir.

40:03.435 --> 40:07.435
I mean with the utmost respect
and affection, Miss Sharp...

40:09.435 --> 40:10.435
...to kiss you.

40:17.435 --> 40:19.435
The music has stopped!
Becky!

40:21.435 --> 40:22.435
Becky!

40:25.435 --> 40:31.434
Not you, I don't want you!
Becky! I'm dying!

40:31.435 --> 40:32.954
SHE SOBS

40:32.955 --> 40:35.435
Lie back, lie back.

40:37.275 --> 40:38.435
I blame him.

40:49.435 --> 40:53.434
My brother gives me mutton
when he knows it makes me ill.

40:53.435 --> 40:55.435
Peace and quiet is what you need.

40:56.435 --> 40:59.435
I'm quite a fragile creature,
you know?

41:00.435 --> 41:02.434
I can see that.

41:02.435 --> 41:03.795
Ooh...

41:09.435 --> 41:13.435
Sometimes I think my entire family
is trying to kill me off.

41:17.435 --> 41:19.024
But what if you survived...

41:20.435 --> 41:23.434
...and saw to your revenge?

41:23.435 --> 41:26.434
That's why they won't kill you,
silly, they're all so afraid of you.

41:26.435 --> 41:28.435
And of Captain Crawley.

41:34.435 --> 41:37.435
My valiant guardsman
will protect me.

41:42.435 --> 41:44.115
Shall I take your front?

41:54.435 --> 41:56.955
There, that didn't hurt, did it?

42:29.435 --> 42:33.274
"I'm so sorry I've not
written to you, my beloved Amelia,

42:33.275 --> 42:35.434
"these many months passed,

42:35.435 --> 42:37.954
"but what news was there to tell
at first?

42:37.955 --> 42:41.274
"The sayings and doings
of Humdrum Hall.

42:41.275 --> 42:44.805
"And what do you care whether
the turnip crop is good or bad?

42:48.435 --> 42:51.434
"But, from the moment
of Aunt Matilda's arrival,

42:51.435 --> 42:53.730
"I determined to make myself
agreeable."

42:54.795 --> 42:58.275
I commend you
on your complete victory.

43:01.435 --> 43:03.634
"Is it not a poor governess's duty,

43:03.635 --> 43:08.435
"who has not a friend or protector
in the world, happy, happy Amelia...

43:09.435 --> 43:13.434
"..who has a dear father, who will
give you anything you ask for."

43:13.435 --> 43:18.434
I'm sorry, I'm his business partner,
surely he wants to see me,

43:18.435 --> 43:19.435
we have things...
Papa?

43:19.436 --> 43:22.114
I know sir, I know,
but he will not see you...

43:22.115 --> 43:23.634
My oldest friend.
There must be some mistake.

43:23.635 --> 43:26.435
Don't let yourself down, sir,
your daughter...

43:28.635 --> 43:30.434
Amelia, come this way.

43:30.435 --> 43:31.671
I hope to see George.

43:32.435 --> 43:35.434
We are not welcome,
we have no admittance.

43:35.435 --> 43:36.435
I don't understand.

43:36.436 --> 43:38.672
Mr Osborne has called in
all his lands.

43:40.435 --> 43:41.435
But...

43:41.436 --> 43:44.435
Amelia, I-I... I can't pay it back!

43:47.435 --> 43:49.434
I'm sorry!
It's all right, sir, come on.

43:49.435 --> 43:50.794
Come!
Come up, sir.

43:50.795 --> 43:52.435
I'm sorry!

44:08.435 --> 44:10.275
No lame ducks.

44:15.435 --> 44:17.434
My French lace handkerchiefs?

44:17.435 --> 44:19.434
I have them.
Laundered here, I suppose,

44:19.435 --> 44:22.434
and utterly ruined?
I washed and pressed them myself.

44:22.435 --> 44:23.435
An angel!

44:25.435 --> 44:27.114
Becky! Becky!

44:27.115 --> 44:31.435
Shoo! I need a nurse
far more than you need a governess.

44:33.435 --> 44:35.434
Rawdon, bring her back!

44:35.435 --> 44:38.474
I have no doubt we will be seeing
Miss Sharp again, my dear.

44:38.475 --> 44:40.435
Dear Lord, I pray not.

45:05.435 --> 45:08.435
We escaped!

45:10.435 --> 45:12.434
Miss Crawley,
you should know that my father

45:12.435 --> 45:14.318
was a martyr to strong liquor...

45:14.475 --> 45:16.534
...and my mother was an opera girl.

45:19.435 --> 45:20.435
Really?

45:21.435 --> 45:23.434
How marvellous!

45:23.435 --> 45:24.955
An opera girl?

45:28.435 --> 45:30.435
Dear!

45:33.475 --> 45:35.435
Thank you, my dear!

45:38.115 --> 45:44.434
Beware old London town,
Miss Sharp is on her way!

45:44.435 --> 45:46.435
An opera girl!
