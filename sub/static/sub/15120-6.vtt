00:02.320 --> 00:04.559
Cafe Khalil, four o'clock.
Don't be late.

00:04.560 --> 00:07.239
Do you expect to come back to work?
I'm your best operative.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.398
Target is Jack Turner.
He is currently bidding to

00:09.399 --> 00:10.760
acquire the Upper Khyber Dam.

00:10.761 --> 00:13.559
JTRP holdings, £1 billion.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.279
Dad, we're short 30 million quid.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.879
We'll just have to get hold of it,
won't we?

00:17.880 --> 00:19.040
This is Gary.

00:20.160 --> 00:21.400
You're the mole.

00:21.401 --> 00:23.239
I did lie. I had to.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.839
The lovely Miss Thorpe
was blackmailing me.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.879
I know we can never get back
what we lost.

00:27.880 --> 00:28.999
What WE lost?

00:29.000 --> 00:33.039
You nearly lost your life,
but the baby...

00:33.040 --> 00:35.119
that was my loss, too.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.279
Five major
multinational corporations.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.599
They formed a secret pact.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.838
They called it Hourglass.

00:42.839 --> 00:44.160
What's Keel's connection?

00:44.161 --> 00:49.439
Three members of the Byzantium board
are CEOs of Hourglass Corporations.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.959
'I want people to become angry

00:50.960 --> 00:53.039
'about the corrupt elements
in our country.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.520
'You referring to
the privatisation of the Khyber Dam?

00:55.521 --> 00:57.239
'I intend to expose and stop it.'

00:57.240 --> 00:59.439
I went to the hospital
this afternoon.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.000
They said you checked yourself out
right after we left.

01:03.040 --> 01:08.239
This programme
contains some violent scenes.

01:08.240 --> 01:14.360
This programme contains
some scenes of a sexual nature.

SPEECH INAUDIBLE

02:54.280 --> 02:56.240
FAX MACHINE BEEPS

03:42.640 --> 03:44.439
Then we're going ahead?

03:44.440 --> 03:45.719
Of course.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.559
You want me to tell Dave?

03:47.560 --> 03:50.559
Dave's turning into
a useless old fart.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.680
Just tell Tyrone.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.679
Sorry. I had to make a phone call.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.039
Another one of your girlfriends?

04:02.040 --> 04:03.800
You know me too well, Auntie.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.679
You want to help on this campaign,

04:06.680 --> 04:08.959
you can't keep disappearing
all the time.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.799
I would do anything for you.
You know that.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.360
You seem worried, Umair.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.680
Aren't you?

04:27.320 --> 04:28.519
What is it?

04:28.520 --> 04:31.760
I know how important this is,
but the risks are considerable.

04:41.040 --> 04:45.480
I will do whatever it takes,
however long it takes.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.280
Do you understand?

04:49.680 --> 04:52.000
You have my loyalty. You know that.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.480
SHE GASPS

05:52.560 --> 05:54.120
That was nice.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.480
It's been a while.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.000
Glad it was me.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.680
Me too.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.640
That was from the accident.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.720
We've both lost so much.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.720
Get some sleep.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.799
You all right?

07:24.800 --> 07:26.040
It's nothing.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.200
I get these sometimes.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.760
And the bruises on your back?

07:46.920 --> 07:47.960
I'm really sorry.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.080
You don't pay me to look like this.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.279
Perhaps you should tell me
what's the matter.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.560
I'm fine, really.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.360
I'm asking.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.559
It's a platelet disorder.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.799
MDS.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.000
Are you on medication?

08:10.001 --> 08:11.040
Mm.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.360
I feel weak. I'm tired all the time.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.600
Don't worry for myself so much,
but...

08:21.760 --> 08:23.720
..I have a little girl.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.040
Must be very difficult.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.919
All these months,
I've never asked your name.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.040
It's Lianne.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.920
Lianne Wells.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.000
DIALS NUMBER ON PHONE

09:06.680 --> 09:08.160
This is Rupert Keel.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.840
My regular girl, Lianne Wells...

09:14.720 --> 09:17.599
..I don't want to see her any longer.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.960
Send someone new next week.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.160
PHONE VIBRATES

09:44.440 --> 09:46.959
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.400
Stephen made a pass at me.

09:50.480 --> 09:51.799
You reciprocated?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.120
What do you think?

09:55.160 --> 09:58.199
And what motivated you
to take THAT course of action?

09:58.200 --> 09:59.320
My job.

10:00.520 --> 10:04.279
So sleeping with him
had nothing to do with the fact
you actually care about him?

10:04.280 --> 10:05.479
And his son?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.720
It's a little late to be jealous,
don't you think?

10:07.721 --> 10:10.479
Or maybe you let yourself feel
something for me again yesterday?

10:10.480 --> 10:12.799
Must have scared
the hell out of you.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.679
This is not about you. No, Sam.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.079
It's about you.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.039
Always looking for a way,
any way you can, to push me aside.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.599
Why would I need to do that
when I don't even know who you are?

10:21.600 --> 10:23.480
Yes, you do.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.960
You have since the moment we met.

10:25.961 --> 10:28.159
You just keep forgetting,
that's all.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.880
ENGINE STARTS

10:37.160 --> 10:38.839
Sam. Aidan.

10:38.840 --> 10:39.920
Where's Fowkes?

10:39.921 --> 10:42.039
Unavailable.
But this couldn't wait. Zoe.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.239
So apparently, Jack Turner
did more than go drinking yesterday.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.759
He had his financing for
the Khyber Dam put into liquidity.

10:48.760 --> 10:49.800
£1 billion in total.

10:49.801 --> 10:53.319
He's fully vested now. One phone
call away from purchasing the dam.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.759
Then at 01:35 this morning,
he received a fax.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.439
We don't know the contents.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.639
A fax is still almost impossible
to intercept digitally.

11:00.640 --> 11:04.119
What's remarkable about this?
Where it came from.
Private airfield in Pakistan.

11:04.120 --> 11:07.839
According to our Islamabad office,
only one flight left at that hour.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.840
And it was carrying
Fatima Zahir to London.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.759
Two hours later,

11:13.760 --> 11:17.199
the body of a Pakistani officer
was found at the airfield.
He'd been strangled.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.119
That can't be a coincidence.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.279
No, it can't.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.479
We need to know who sent this fax,
what it said
and why it's worth killing for.

11:23.480 --> 11:27.000
Perhaps Stephen Turner can be
helpful. He's Sam's latest conquest.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.439
He seems to know little or nothing

11:31.440 --> 11:34.319
about the criminal side
of his father's activities.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.560
I could speak to Lewis Conroy.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.560
Lewis Conroy is dead.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.159
How?

11:46.160 --> 11:49.319
We led Jack Turner to believe
his secretary saw him

11:49.320 --> 11:52.959
murder the economics professor,
Vincent Cage.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.200
Was this necessary?

11:54.201 --> 11:57.000
It became necessary
when you let yourself be seen.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.040
That's all. Thanks.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.279
Look, I just can't get past this.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.319
You're human. I forgive you.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.719
It's not your forgiveness I need.
What, then?

12:20.720 --> 12:22.519
Aidan. I still think he's lying.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.599
He is.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.879
Then you think he got
Hasan captured,

12:25.880 --> 12:27.600
despite what Natalie Thorpe
told you?

12:27.601 --> 12:30.719
And Sam knows about it.
It seems they're working together.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.359
Then we're being lied to.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.199
That's not a surprise.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.039
We've known that since the day
Sam returned.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.119
If he got Hasan killed, then the
rest of us could still be at risk.

12:40.120 --> 12:43.359
Aidan had a chance to kill us
yesterday and he didn't.
Doesn't mean anything

12:43.360 --> 12:46.559
or explain why
he's looking into Hourglass.
We have a client to serve.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.399
He's grown very restive of late.

12:48.400 --> 12:51.519
Jack Turner seems far too confident.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.680
Complete the op.

12:52.681 --> 12:54.920
I'll take care of Sam and Aidan.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.960
HE VOMITS

13:47.960 --> 13:49.720
So, you was in the Army, yeah?

13:52.280 --> 13:54.359
You feeling all right, Mr T?

13:54.360 --> 13:56.560
I mean,
you're actually talking to me.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.200
Dave says you was in the Army.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.039
Yes. I was in the Army.

14:04.040 --> 14:07.719
So you got to shoot rifles
and all of that?

14:07.720 --> 14:09.799
Rifles, guns, knives.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.120
If it hurt people,
I learned how to use it.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.239
Sounds like fun.

14:15.240 --> 14:19.079
Yeah. A lot of laughs.
Shooting people, getting shot at.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.240
Good times all round.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.759
What are we doing here?

14:33.760 --> 14:35.280
DOOR BUZZER

14:48.640 --> 14:51.320
What's the matter,
you don't trust me anymore?

14:52.440 --> 14:53.919
Who's your friend?

14:53.920 --> 14:55.320
Weapons man.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.680
It's in there.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.840
It's a beaut.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.720
Where's the money?

15:38.600 --> 15:39.840
GUNSHOTS

15:41.080 --> 15:42.960
What'd you do that for?

15:51.120 --> 15:52.360
Don't forget the case.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.879
I got down early.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.520
Managed to make a cup
before Mrs Sidwa came in.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.639
That's the best cup of coffee
I've ever had in this house.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.240
SHE CHUCKLES

16:53.040 --> 16:54.839
I should go.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.800
Eddie will be awake in a minute.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.800
I don't know what to say.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.319
You don't have to say anything.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.560
SHOWER RUNS

17:36.360 --> 17:39.159
There are seven members
of the Byzantium board of directors.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.560
Three are Hourglass conspirators.
So where do we start?

17:41.561 --> 17:44.680
Polyhedrus - the third largest
private corporation in the world.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.760
Dr Hill, I'm going to get
you out of here.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.959
Any luck with the fax?

18:24.960 --> 18:27.119
I'm trying to recapture audio.
No luck.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.320
What about Zahir?

18:28.321 --> 18:30.399
Her plane landed at Heathrow
an hour ago.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.719
She's on a one-day fund-raising
trip. All closed meetings
at the hotel with big-money donors.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.599
Except for a speech this afternoon

18:36.600 --> 18:38.520
at the Asia Promise Society
at 3pm.

18:38.521 --> 18:40.519
That's her only public appearance.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.959
Rahim Soomro, the Pakistani minister
auctioning the dam
will also be there.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.479
I'm assuming Jack Turner
is nowhere on that itinerary.

18:46.480 --> 18:49.560
Turner's hardly the sort of man
she'd invite to tea.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.759
Everything all right, Deacon?

18:53.760 --> 18:56.639
Bloody hell,
it's good to be back here.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.120
Never thought those words
would pass my lips.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.519
Why are you dumping this shit
on my desk?

19:07.520 --> 19:09.079
It's for you. What is it?

19:09.080 --> 19:11.999
Address and description
of two blokes Tyrone murdered.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.559
I wrote those notes in the toilet.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.599
What did he murder them for?

19:15.600 --> 19:16.920
That's what I'd like to know.

19:16.921 --> 19:19.079
He shot them both in cold blood.
Arts dealer?

19:19.080 --> 19:22.079
Arms. Says "arms." -huh.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.360
Nice bit of kit, actually...

19:23.361 --> 19:26.719
heads-up display,
lightweight stock...

19:26.720 --> 19:30.039
Wait a minute,
you're talking about a sniper rifle?

19:30.040 --> 19:32.640
Tyrone said he needed it
for something this afternoon.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.400
What?

19:55.360 --> 19:56.520
Candidate Zahir.

19:56.521 --> 19:58.799
It's a privilege
to welcome you to London.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.879
I appreciate your courtesy,
Minister.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.319
But forgive me
if I question your sincerity.

20:03.320 --> 20:06.359
We may disagree politically, but
we both serve the same great nation.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.760
I know what interests you serve...

20:07.761 --> 20:11.599
the corporations that would loot
our treasury and line your pockets.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.920
Surely even you appreciate
the need for investment.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.920
To raise the standard
of living for our people.

20:15.921 --> 20:18.519
If only that were your intent,
Minister.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.559
Then you and I
would have no quarrel at all.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.240
Excuse me.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.679
Morning, all.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.359
Coffee?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.359
Er...

20:38.360 --> 20:40.000
No, thank you.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.479
PHONE RINGS

20:42.480 --> 20:46.279
What's the book, Eddie? It's
The Snow Maiden. Alex gave it to me.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.679
My mother used to read it to me.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.000
She did, did she?

20:51.760 --> 20:54.480
Huh. Mr Stephen. It's for you.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.960
Hello...

21:02.480 --> 21:04.320
Yeah.

21:09.760 --> 21:10.800
Yeah.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.080
Thank you.

What is it?

21:29.920 --> 21:31.119
Um...

21:31.120 --> 21:33.320
You saw Lewis the other night.
How did he seem to you?

21:33.321 --> 21:35.439
He was fine. He seemed fine.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.439
Stephen, what's wrong?

21:37.440 --> 21:38.480
Morning.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.240
What's the matter, Stevie?

21:41.241 --> 21:43.839
Er... that was the police.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.080
Lewis is dead.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.359
What?

21:47.360 --> 21:48.760
Did they say what happened?

21:48.761 --> 21:50.079
Er... murder-suicide.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.959
They're saying that he killed
his secretary and her husband too.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.319
No. That's awful.

21:54.320 --> 21:55.799
Offed himself?

21:55.800 --> 21:57.360
Well, I didn't see that one coming.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.759
No.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.999
That's a heavy blow, son.
He was a...

22:02.000 --> 22:03.400
Was a good friend to this family.

22:03.401 --> 22:05.679
I don't want to tell Eddie,
not just yet.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.120
No, no. Whatever you think best.

22:07.121 --> 22:11.040
I just need a moment. Can you get
him ready for school? Right away.

22:12.480 --> 22:13.720
Come on, sweetheart.

22:13.721 --> 22:15.400
OK.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.760
Here, let me help you.
Do you need these?

Mm. OK.

This is Everett. DI Everett,
my name's Stephen Turner.

22:38.521 --> 22:41.919
I understand you're investigating
the death of my friend.
Lewis Conroy.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.119
That's right.

22:43.120 --> 22:46.199
'I wonder
if we might speak in person.'

22:46.200 --> 22:47.240
What's this about?

22:47.241 --> 22:50.200
I have some information
I think you should hear.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.280
What's your address, Mr Turner?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.039
What's this?

23:39.040 --> 23:40.520
Remains of the fax Jack received.

23:40.521 --> 23:42.879
Good. We'll see what Zoe can do.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.159
I also found a report.
With Horst Goebel's name on it.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.960
You've had a busy morning.
Where'd you find it?

23:49.960 --> 23:51.640
Stephen's bedroom.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.440
What kind of report?

23:55.600 --> 23:58.439
Highly technical, about
the completion of the Khyber Dam.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.879
Apparently Goebel
is one of the engineers.

24:00.880 --> 24:03.199
But I saw another name I recognised.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.240
Arthur Hill.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.079
The doctor Faroux tortured
in Tangier? He works at Polyhedrus.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.519
Hourglass.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.919
Yeah, it all fits together
rather nicely.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.560
Very snugly.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.519
What are you going to do?
Polyhedrus has offices in London.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.718
I'm going to see if I can find Hill
for some answers.

24:19.719 --> 24:20.760
That's bad timing.

24:20.761 --> 24:24.399
Jack Turner's planning to have Zahir
assassinated later on today.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.039
I didn't know Jack
was in the assassination business.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.719
Fowkes picked up a sniper's rifle
with Tyrone.

24:29.720 --> 24:33.959
We think they're going to use it
at the Asia Promise Society this
afternoon. Why would he kill Zahir?

24:33.960 --> 24:38.479
She's opposed to the sale of the
dam. She may be, but she can't
stop it. He doesn't need her dead.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.839
Perhaps. But we think
he wants her dead anyway.

24:40.840 --> 24:44.799
Keel won't tolerate you
pursuing personal business.
Today of all days.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.679
This isn't personal.

24:46.680 --> 24:51.279
I need to know what was in that case
that Horst Goebel gave Turner.

24:51.280 --> 24:53.920
And Hill might have some answers.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.320
"C...4."

25:15.320 --> 25:16.360
"I'm trusting you."

25:16.361 --> 25:20.039
Why would Zahir trust Jack Turner?
She wouldn't.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.999
And what is
"Something something C4"?

25:26.480 --> 25:29.679
Right, I want you to stay on him,
you understand?

25:29.680 --> 25:32.599
You've got to make sure
he doesn't use that rifle.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.200
Don't let him out of your sight.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.320
Thank you for coming, Inspector.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.000
Please.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.199
You said you had, er...

26:05.200 --> 26:06.359
information.

26:06.360 --> 26:09.999
Your officer told me
that Trudy Barnes and her husband,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.759
they were shot with the same weapon
that killed Lewis.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.239
That's correct.

26:14.240 --> 26:18.199
Well, I can understand why you'd
conclude this was a murder-suicide.

26:18.200 --> 26:21.319
But I can tell you, Inspector,
it wasn't.

26:21.320 --> 26:22.600
How do you know that?

26:22.601 --> 26:26.559
He told me two days ago how happy
he was that she'd gotten married.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.960
The idea that he'd kill her
or himself...

26:30.400 --> 26:31.960
..it's not possible.

26:33.920 --> 26:38.599
Mr Turner, if people
never did anything out of character,

26:38.600 --> 26:40.600
we wouldn't have any murders,
would we?

26:43.760 --> 26:47.919
Well, were you aware that his
professor was killed two days ago?

26:47.920 --> 26:48.960
Yes.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.759
And we've already made an arrest
in that case.

26:53.760 --> 26:54.880
With a full confession.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.640
I read it in the paper.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.520
But you still think there
might be a connection?

27:01.960 --> 27:04.879
Well, I don't know. But it seems
worth looking at, doesn't it?

27:04.880 --> 27:06.600
Two friends killed
in a matter of days.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.959
It certainly does seem worth
looking at. And I'll do just that.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.959
Thank you, Inspector.
I appreciate it.

27:13.960 --> 27:17.839
And please don't hesitate to call me
if you think of anything else.

27:17.840 --> 27:18.960
I'll see myself out.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.160

27:53.320 --> 27:55.840
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.319
How's it coming?
With the bid for the dam, I mean.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.359
Well, now that we're funded,

28:02.360 --> 28:05.839
we just have to persuade Soomro
to accept our offer over the Chinese.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.479
How do we do that?

28:07.480 --> 28:08.919
I'm working on it.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.320
You know our portfolio went up
by £32 million yesterday,

28:11.321 --> 28:14.359
right when we needed the money?
That's right.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.760
That's an awfully neat trick, Dad.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.879
Lucky, Stevie, that's all.

28:19.880 --> 28:20.920
Just lucky.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.759

she's giving her speech?

'Thank you. Thank you all.'

29:03.040 --> 29:04.080

29:22.320 --> 29:24.719
I always watch myself, Dave.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.600
No, I mean it. He's up to something.

A few hours after I rescued you,
I was ambushed by three men.

I have reason to believe
they were sent by your employer.

Bernard Faroux.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.159

That's right.

32:03.320 --> 32:05.840
What made you so valuable to him?

What do you mean?

32:10.000 --> 32:11.280
He had you tortured.

32:12.720 --> 32:15.520
He must've been
trying to find out something.

32:16.680 --> 32:17.840

Any connection to the dam?
'Not directly.'

33:24.081 --> 33:27.840

territory is the Khyber Valley.
It's where the dam's built.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.199
My client has asked us
to ensure your safety.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.319
Your client?

39:35.320 --> 39:36.520
And who might that be?

39:37.880 --> 39:39.319
Does it matter?

39:39.320 --> 39:40.840
Someone wants to kill you.

39:42.040 --> 39:46.199
In my country, someone is trying
to kill me every day.

39:46.200 --> 39:49.200
If I let that stop me,
I would never get out of bed.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.520
I have a meeting, and I'm late.

39:53.680 --> 39:56.239
So unless you intend
to kill me yourself...

39:56.240 --> 39:58.800
I understand what you're
fighting against, Madam Zahir.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.599
But you can't win the battle
if you're dead.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.320
LIFT PINGS

40:11.880 --> 40:14.000
That's him.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.719
What do you want with him?

40:17.720 --> 40:19.359
You remember where I said to meet?

40:19.360 --> 40:20.400
Yeah.

40:28.440 --> 40:30.160
HE WHISTLES TUNLESSLY

40:35.400 --> 40:37.399
Long day?

40:37.400 --> 40:39.720
It's harder being a rabbit
than it looks.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.719
GUN COCKS

40:46.720 --> 40:48.000
Fancy a carrot?

41:01.640 --> 41:03.199
Wallet and keys.

41:03.200 --> 41:06.080
You're mugging Rafi the Rabbit?
Are you bloody serious?

41:15.160 --> 41:16.960
Oi, give me the gun.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.520
Get in.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.679
Now look, I...

41:39.680 --> 41:40.920
I said, get in.

41:40.921 --> 41:43.639
I've done nothing to you,
what is all this about?

41:43.640 --> 41:44.959
What are you doing?

41:44.960 --> 41:46.520
THE MAN GROANS

41:50.200 --> 41:51.600
Please, no.

41:52.680 --> 41:54.480
GUNSHOTS

41:55.480 --> 41:57.760
Are you freaking crazy?!
Get in the car.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.680
Get in the car!

42:28.840 --> 42:30.639
Sorry to keep you waiting.

42:30.640 --> 42:35.439
Right, now, we've received
your latest imaging scans.

42:35.440 --> 42:37.360
And at least the news
isn't any worse.

42:38.400 --> 42:42.039
You can see here, the astrocytoma
in your temporal lobe.

42:42.040 --> 42:47.319
In the past few weeks, it's actually
shrunk a few millimetres.

42:47.320 --> 42:48.999
So the medication's working?

42:49.000 --> 42:53.919
It's possible, but with
a malignant tumour, unlikely.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.320
I don't want you
to raise your hopes.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.399
Have you thought more
about what we discussed?

43:00.400 --> 43:02.640
It is important
you get your affairs in order.

43:03.680 --> 43:05.039
Yes.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.559
How are you bearing up?

43:06.560 --> 43:08.478
I'm throwing up
two or three times a day.

43:08.479 --> 43:09.920
I feel weak down my left side,

43:09.921 --> 43:11.920
and I have a headache
more or less all the time.

43:11.921 --> 43:13.119
Mm.

43:13.120 --> 43:17.439
I'm wondering about your spirits.
Your state of mind.

43:17.440 --> 43:18.960
My state of mind?

43:21.840 --> 43:23.200
How would you imagine it is?

43:23.201 --> 43:25.599
Of course, this is difficult.

43:25.600 --> 43:27.239
Yeah.

43:27.240 --> 43:30.519
Facing one's own mortality
is frightening.

43:30.520 --> 43:32.159
But it's also an opportunity.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.599
Is it? For what?

43:33.600 --> 43:38.200
To assess, to appreciate.
To find meaning in one's life.

43:42.680 --> 43:43.920
Can I have a word?

43:46.600 --> 43:48.440
Alone.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.160
Of course.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.200
Bingham said you'd had words.

44:03.760 --> 44:06.640
I can understand
if you're upset about Lewis.

44:07.640 --> 44:08.840
About Lewis?

44:12.520 --> 44:14.040
How stupid do you think I am, Dad?

44:15.560 --> 44:17.280
I don't think you're stupid at all.

44:17.281 --> 44:21.439
You weren't "lucky". You caused
the explosion at Goncourt.

44:21.440 --> 44:24.040
That's how you raised
£32 million overnight.

44:25.200 --> 44:26.880
A woman was killed.

44:30.600 --> 44:34.879
I don't know what you're
talking about, Stevie. Yeah, you do.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.360
I'm your son, Dad.

44:43.560 --> 44:46.039
I tell you what you need to know.

44:46.040 --> 44:47.599
I need to know the truth.

44:47.600 --> 44:51.119
You never had any intention
of going legitimate with this dam.

44:51.120 --> 44:53.719
That word - "legitimate."

44:53.720 --> 44:57.039
You really think these men you went
to your fancy schools with,

44:57.040 --> 44:59.679
these bankers and lawyers,
are better than your own father?

44:59.680 --> 45:01.799
They don't get people killed.
Don't they?

45:01.800 --> 45:04.439
Read the papers, son. What do you
think's happening out there?

45:04.440 --> 45:06.919
You're crying because,
what, you want respect?

45:06.920 --> 45:09.079
I'm not looking
for your RESPECT, Dad!

45:09.080 --> 45:11.919
You don't respect the life
I've built for you and for your son.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.120
This life is rotten.

45:13.121 --> 45:15.879
Eddie and I should've left
a long time ago.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.679
You want to go? Leave, anytime.

45:18.680 --> 45:20.680
But you'll never take my grandson.

45:34.920 --> 45:36.520
Where the hell are we going?

46:06.440 --> 46:08.360
PHONE BEEPS

46:27.760 --> 46:29.879
Flat 33, yeah?

46:29.880 --> 46:31.519
I'll be right there.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.359
Where the hell are you going?

46:33.360 --> 46:35.080
I said, "I'll be right there."

47:27.520 --> 47:31.720
NOISE OF CROWD DROWNS OUT SPEECH

47:32.720 --> 47:35.399
Gentlemen, will you excuse me,
please? Yes, sure.

47:35.400 --> 47:36.680
That was good. Absolutely.

47:36.681 --> 47:38.759
A man got to her.

47:38.760 --> 47:41.639
He got past her guards in the lift.
What are you talking about?

47:41.640 --> 47:44.559
She told me he warned her she was
going to be killed this afternoon.

47:44.560 --> 47:47.680
Has she changed her plans?
No. She's going forward.

47:49.040 --> 47:51.519
Then hold your nerve, Umair.

47:51.520 --> 47:54.240
Your family stands to make a lot
of money when this dam is sold.

47:55.920 --> 47:58.919
It's going to be a good day.

47:58.920 --> 48:00.040
A VERY good day.

48:07.080 --> 48:09.639
Just seen Qassani talking to Soomro.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.199
'What about?'

48:11.200 --> 48:14.040
'I don't know,
but I think I could guess.'

48:19.600 --> 48:20.759
Let's go.

48:20.760 --> 48:22.679
How did you got here?

48:22.680 --> 48:24.200
Got a call from Keel.

48:25.440 --> 48:26.999
How did HE know I was here?

48:27.000 --> 48:29.799
He didn't say.
He just said to come get you.

48:29.800 --> 48:32.840
Now come on,
Zahir's speech is starting.

48:35.360 --> 48:38.880
APPLAUSE

48:52.600 --> 48:54.240
Thank you.

48:56.760 --> 48:58.680
Thank you. Thank you all.

48:59.800 --> 49:01.719
It's a cold day outside

49:01.720 --> 49:06.440
but I am warmed by the sight
of so many friendly faces.

49:11.360 --> 49:15.359
Our country is blessed
with natural resources,

49:15.360 --> 49:18.079
but riven with sectarian conflict,

49:18.080 --> 49:21.399
making us vulnerable to predators...

49:21.400 --> 49:23.759
multinational corporations,

49:23.760 --> 49:27.400
interested in ever greater
wealth and power.

49:28.400 --> 49:30.159
Where the hell is he?

49:30.160 --> 49:32.519
It's not just Pakistan
whose fate is at stake.

49:32.520 --> 49:35.559
This financial crisis
was engineered

49:35.560 --> 49:38.959
by those same banks
and corporations...

49:38.960 --> 49:42.359
..willing to make billions suffer.

49:42.360 --> 49:45.959
Together we will fight
this fight...

49:45.960 --> 49:47.279
..bless our country...

49:47.280 --> 49:49.120
..only to further
enrich themselves...

49:49.121 --> 49:51.760
..economic justice
with just words...

49:52.960 --> 49:56.799
We will protect
the interests of our nation.

49:56.800 --> 50:00.559
We will gather evidence
against foreign corporations,

50:00.560 --> 50:02.439
bring them to justice...

50:02.440 --> 50:05.279
..make it the right
of the Pakistani people

50:05.280 --> 50:08.439
to live in a nation ruled by law,
not by profit.

50:08.440 --> 50:10.679
Thank you.

50:10.680 --> 50:13.240
APPLAUSE

50:21.960 --> 50:25.399
I found the original document
on Hill's desk.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.318
That fax you intercepted
wasn't from Zahir,

50:27.319 --> 50:29.120
it was sent to her from Doctor Hill.

50:29.121 --> 50:31.719
And a call log showed
that he sent a fax to Pakistan.

50:31.720 --> 50:34.759
Why would someone from Zahir's camp
forward that to Jack Turner?

50:34.760 --> 50:36.799
Because Hill's
some kind of whistle-blower.

50:36.800 --> 50:40.119
He ran when I questioned him.
So what is it he knows?

50:40.120 --> 50:43.640
I don't know, but it must be
something worth killing for.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.680
BRAKES SCREECH

51:03.440 --> 51:05.399
Well?

51:05.400 --> 51:07.559
There's no hurry,
the speech is over.

51:07.560 --> 51:10.519
What happened? Zahir's gone back
to the hotel with her entourage.

51:10.520 --> 51:13.319
Sam thinks Zahir's going to meet
with a whistle-blower. Dr Hill.

51:13.320 --> 51:14.680
The man we rescued in Tangier.

51:14.681 --> 51:16.919
PHONE RINGS
It's Fowkes. Where's Tyrone?

51:16.920 --> 51:19.320
'I was trying to reach you.
He murdered Rafi the Rabbit.'

51:19.321 --> 51:21.359
What? Tyrone.
He killed Rafi the Rabbit.

51:21.360 --> 51:23.760
Now he's got me waiting in his flat.
What, Tyrone's?

51:23.761 --> 51:27.039
No. Rafi's! You're waiting in
Rafi the Rabbit's flat - for what?

51:27.040 --> 51:29.079
It can't be good.
He said he'd be right up.

51:29.080 --> 51:32.159
'Here's the thing,
Rafi's flat is across
from Brensham Hotel.'

51:32.160 --> 51:35.199
He's opposite Zahir's hotel.
'He's got to be messing with me.'

51:35.200 --> 51:38.160
Stay put. Wait for him to come back.
We're on our way.

51:56.760 --> 51:59.559
If Turner wants to stop Hill
talking, why wait for him to show?

51:59.560 --> 52:02.959
The fax was unsigned.
He knows there's a whistle-blower,
but not that it's Hill.

52:02.960 --> 52:07.319
He'll know it's Hill when he shows
up for their meeting. That's when
Tyrone'll pull the trigger.

52:07.320 --> 52:09.120
Fax said "4,"
that's two minutes from now.

52:09.121 --> 52:11.719
Yeah, but we don't know
where it's taking place. Zahir does.

52:11.720 --> 52:13.000
Split up, we need to find her.

52:17.160 --> 52:20.439
It's all right, Umair.
No-one's seen us.

52:20.440 --> 52:22.360
I just want to make sure
you're safe.

52:24.840 --> 52:27.680
'They're not
in the conference room.'

52:28.720 --> 52:31.560
'No sign of them
on the third floor.'

52:53.760 --> 52:55.879
"WSC." They're in
the Winston Churchill room.

52:55.880 --> 52:58.160
Which floor? 'Second. Second floor.'

53:02.000 --> 53:03.759
Madame Zahir.

53:03.760 --> 53:07.919
Thank you for trusting me, Dr Hill.
You're a very brave man.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.839
No, I'm not brave.

53:09.840 --> 53:12.479
I just couldn't live
with this anymore.

53:12.480 --> 53:14.280
What is it you have to tell me?

53:20.760 --> 53:22.640
Hundreds were killed.

53:23.880 --> 53:25.680
And I'm responsible.

53:32.840 --> 53:34.559
Get down!

53:34.560 --> 53:36.680
GUNSHOT
GLASS SMASHES

53:55.520 --> 53:57.560
'So, you was in the army,
yeah?'

54:00.760 --> 54:02.120
I'm the patsy.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.000
I'm the bloody patsy.

54:07.440 --> 54:08.720
Hill?

54:09.960 --> 54:12.399
What did he tell you?

54:12.400 --> 54:15.519
I don't know, something
about the dam. Some terrible crime.

54:15.520 --> 54:19.280
How did they find out?
This meeting was secret.

54:22.560 --> 54:24.240
You can't think that it was me?

54:34.120 --> 54:36.479
Armed police! Armed police!

54:36.480 --> 54:37.680
Go, go, go! Clear!

54:38.880 --> 54:40.960
Armed police!

54:42.280 --> 54:44.400
Suspect's in flight.

54:50.640 --> 54:54.960
SIRENS BLARE

55:03.840 --> 55:05.720
Eddie? What are you doing in here?

55:06.720 --> 55:10.040
Dad's out,
and I didn't want to be alone.

55:19.760 --> 55:21.160
What's the matter?

55:22.160 --> 55:23.200
Nothing.

55:24.600 --> 55:27.400
You're sure? Nothing happened today?

55:29.800 --> 55:33.999
Uncle Lewis died.
Did Daddy tell you?

55:34.000 --> 55:35.639
Yes, he did.

55:35.640 --> 55:37.760
We only saw him a couple days ago.

55:39.240 --> 55:40.400
And now he's gone.

55:42.120 --> 55:43.640
Just like Mum.

55:53.160 --> 55:54.520
Can you read your book to me?

55:58.440 --> 56:00.240
Sure I can.

56:09.760 --> 56:11.960
I'm glad you're here, Alex.

56:14.440 --> 56:15.640
So am I.

56:23.960 --> 56:25.200
Mr Turner.

56:27.200 --> 56:29.200
Why all the cloak and dagger?

56:30.600 --> 56:33.400
You know, I would've been happy
to meet back at your house.

56:35.120 --> 56:37.680
I saw you talking
with Bingham this morning.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.400
He's paying you, isn't he?

56:41.800 --> 56:43.919
You'd best talk to
Mr Bingham about that.

56:43.920 --> 56:46.360
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll double it.

56:47.560 --> 56:52.479
Here's £10,000. Take it.
It's a down payment.

56:52.480 --> 56:53.680
A down payment on what?

56:53.681 --> 56:58.200
Information. Anything you tell him,
I want you to tell me first.

56:59.240 --> 57:01.400
I don't think Mr Bingham
would like that too much.

57:02.840 --> 57:04.160
He won't know.

57:05.280 --> 57:08.999
C'mon, Inspector, take it.
We're all on the same side.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.680
I just don't like being
kept in the dark, that's all.

57:20.200 --> 57:24.639
As it happens, Mr Turner,
I do I have some information

57:24.640 --> 57:27.040
that I was planning to take
to Mr Bingham this evening.

57:27.041 --> 57:29.079
What is it?

57:29.080 --> 57:31.800
That woman you have
working in your house...

57:33.520 --> 57:34.800
Alex Kent?

57:40.200 --> 57:43.240
..she's not who you think she is.

57:51.280 --> 57:53.399
Explain this.
Are you accusing me of something?

57:53.400 --> 57:54.720
Just answer the question.

57:54.721 --> 57:56.959
'Sam was nearly killed
and Ballard's dead.'

57:56.960 --> 57:58.959
You think they'd hesitate
to kill you too?

57:58.960 --> 58:01.160
You trusted me,
that trust nearly got you killed.

58:01.161 --> 58:02.959
And cost us our child.

58:02.960 --> 58:04.879
I hope you don't expect pity.

58:04.880 --> 58:05.960
No, not pity.

58:07.440 --> 58:08.799
Respect.

58:08.800 --> 58:11.159
Jack Turner's
finally shown his hand.

58:11.160 --> 58:12.240
And it's blackmail.

58:14.560 --> 58:18.399
Our client wants you dead. That's
why you disappeared last year.

58:18.400 --> 58:21.359
SHE YELLS

58:21.360 --> 58:23.200
'There was something else
in his files.'

58:23.201 --> 58:26.320
The murder of Katherine Morton.
She was my mother.

58:46.960 --> 58:50.000
