WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:03.118
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:03.337 --> 00:04.588
If a Druid went
down the wrong path,

00:04.797 --> 00:07.038
there's a Gaelic word
for that as well, Darach.

00:07.258 --> 00:09.123
If these aren't random killings,
then what are they?

00:09.302 --> 00:11.668
- Sacrifices.
- Virgins, healers, warriors...

00:11.929 --> 00:15.342
How do you know your Dark Druid
isn't your wise veterinarian?

00:15.558 --> 00:18.174
He's been tracking and marking everything.
All the dead bodies.

00:18.394 --> 00:20.225
- I'm not a psychic.
- You're something!

01:16.536 --> 01:18.242
What are you guys doing here so late?

01:18.704 --> 01:20.319
Practice for a recital tomorrow.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.367
Why? Something wrong?

01:25.503 --> 01:27.209
There is something wrong, isn't there?

01:27.421 --> 01:30.254
Someone made a 911 call.
All of you need to leave now.

01:30.466 --> 01:33.424
If you see anyone else,
tell them the same thing.

01:37.974 --> 01:41.558
Dispatch, this is unit ten. Do you copy?

01:43.312 --> 01:45.428
Dispatch, do you copy?

02:28.190 --> 02:31.057
This is Deputy Graeme
with the sheriff's department.

02:31.235 --> 02:34.318
Step out with your hands in the air.

02:36.949 --> 02:40.407
This is the sheriff's department.
Come out now.

03:37.802 --> 03:38.791
Where is she?

03:39.011 --> 03:39.966
Over here.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.259
- Lydia?
- It's the same thing.

03:44.475 --> 03:45.555
Same thing as the pool.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.762
I got into the car heading
somewhere totally different,

03:47.978 --> 03:49.263
and ended up here.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.687
And you told me to call you
if there's a dead body.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.230
- You found a dead body?
- Not yet.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.852
"Not yet"? What do you mean "not yet"?

03:55.069 --> 03:56.730
You're supposed to call
us after you find the dead body.

03:56.946 --> 03:59.653
No, I'm not doing that again.
You find the dead body from now on.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.401
How are we supposed
to find the dead body?

04:01.617 --> 04:03.608
You're always the one
finding the dead body.

04:03.828 --> 04:05.113
Guys.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.707
I found the dead body.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.303
Excuse me.

05:03.512 --> 05:06.424
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Back it up.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.557
I know what you're thinking.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.510
I know you've got all these ideas

05:12.730 --> 05:14.470
about patterns and people dying in threes...

05:14.690 --> 05:16.226
Dad, murdered, okay?

05:16.400 --> 05:17.776
Sacrificed, actually.

05:17.985 --> 05:21.523
I've got half the state,
including the FBI, coming in on this.

05:21.739 --> 05:23.730
They're not getting away
with killing one of our own.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.780
Dad, they killed Tara.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.280
You know, how many times did
she help me with my math homework

05:29.455 --> 05:31.195
when I had to wait at the station for you?

05:32.625 --> 05:35.492
Just get to class, okay?

05:46.222 --> 05:47.928
I heard about the recital tonight,

05:48.140 --> 05:51.803
the thing to honor the losses at school.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.977
They were murders, Dad, not losses.

05:55.815 --> 05:57.351
But your friends will be there, right?

05:57.691 --> 05:58.942
Yeah, I guess.

05:59.151 --> 06:00.607
Want me to take you?

06:01.904 --> 06:03.394
I don't think I'm feeling up for it.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.775
Okay. I get it.

06:13.833 --> 06:16.165
Take as many days as you need.

06:16.460 --> 06:17.666
School can wait.

07:01.797 --> 07:02.832
What do you think you're doing?

07:03.382 --> 07:04.713
You weren't at school.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.957
Scott send you to check up on me?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.543
Maybe he's worried about you.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.134
I can take care of myself.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.556
Yeah, I've noticed.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.305
More than once.

07:18.981 --> 07:23.395
Idioms, analogies, metaphors, and similes,

07:23.611 --> 07:26.648
all tools the writer uses to tell their story.

07:28.616 --> 07:32.108
Lydia, I wasn't aware
you had so many hidden talents.

07:32.328 --> 07:34.865
You and every guy I've ever dated.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.948
Well, that was an idiom, by the way.

07:42.338 --> 07:43.999
Idioms are something of a secret

07:44.214 --> 07:48.833
to the people who know
the language or the culture.

07:51.180 --> 07:54.513
They're phrases that only make sense
if you know key words.

07:54.725 --> 07:57.011
Saying "jump the gun"
is meaningful only if you know

07:57.227 --> 07:59.263
about the starting gun in a race,

07:59.480 --> 08:01.436
or a phrase like

08:01.649 --> 08:03.435
"seeing the whole board."

08:03.651 --> 08:04.515
Like chess.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.271
That's right, Stiles.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.685
Do you play?

08:08.405 --> 08:09.986
No. My father does.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.654
Now, when does
an idiom become a cliche?

08:14.954 --> 08:16.819
I think I can get to Ethan.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.529
I'm pretty sure I can make him talk.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.868
What do you want to do that for?

08:21.502 --> 08:23.914
The Druids are emissaries, right?

08:24.129 --> 08:27.041
So what if the Darach
was an emissary to the Alphas?

08:27.257 --> 08:28.508
Okay, first of all, I cannot believe

08:28.717 --> 08:30.253
that we've gotten to the point
where a sentence like,

08:30.469 --> 08:32.255
"What if the Darach
was an emissary to the Alphas?"

08:32.471 --> 08:33.586
actually makes sense to me.

08:33.806 --> 08:36.263
Second of all, we're gonna have
a huge problem getting to Ethan.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.807
- What's that?
- Going through Aiden.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.267
This whole thing with Danny,
it needs to stop.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.145
He's harmless.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.847
And Lydia's the one
we're supposed to worry about.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.186
Then why are you still talking to Danny?

08:47.403 --> 08:48.984
What difference does it make?

08:50.155 --> 08:51.406
What do you think we're doing here?

08:51.824 --> 08:53.530
You know we're not actual
high school students, right?

08:53.826 --> 08:55.441
We're here to eliminate a threat,

08:55.661 --> 08:58.243
not hold hands and pass notes in class.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.868
And now, we know he's harmless.
Threat eliminated.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.745
You're starting to like him.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.838
So what?

09:07.047 --> 09:11.165
So if Deucalion asks you,
would you kill him?

09:11.844 --> 09:13.755
If Deucalion asks you, would you kill me?

09:15.305 --> 09:18.047
Stop talking to Danny.

09:20.477 --> 09:24.140
Or I'm gonna rip the flesh off his face
and eat it.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.806
Ever since he's been back at school,
they're always together.

09:26.984 --> 09:29.100
How are we gonna separate them again?

09:36.368 --> 09:37.528
What now?

09:48.672 --> 09:50.208
What's that look for?

09:51.467 --> 09:54.925
Nothing. I'm just kind of surprised.
You've barely talked to me since...

09:55.137 --> 09:56.547
Since what?

09:56.764 --> 09:58.629
Since you killed Boyd?

09:58.849 --> 10:00.214
I told you that was Kali.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.216
I didn't have a choice.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.181
I thought you were all Alphas.

10:05.355 --> 10:08.518
Yeah, well, it's not
as democratic as it sounds.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.144
If you're thinking I should
be all filled with remorse,

10:10.360 --> 10:11.861
just try and remember Derek killed Ennis.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.070
So it's his turn to kill someone now.
Is that it?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.022
Maybe.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.107
Maybe like the time
he and Boyd tried to kill you.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.153
How'd you know about that?

10:30.339 --> 10:32.204
What the hell is that?

10:34.468 --> 10:35.674
Derek.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.844
Why are you even talking to me?
I helped kill your friend.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.387
How do you know I'm not
gonna kill another one?

10:48.565 --> 10:50.101
Is he looking at me?

10:50.317 --> 10:52.273
Are you threatening me?
You know what I'm gonna do?

10:52.444 --> 10:55.277
I'm going to break off an
extra-large branch of Mountain Ash,

10:55.489 --> 10:58.447
wrap it in wolfsbane, roll it in mistletoe,
and shove it up your freaking...

10:58.659 --> 11:01.401
Stiles, okay. We get it.

11:03.122 --> 11:04.828
We're talking to you

11:05.040 --> 11:06.996
because I know
that you didn't want to kill Boyd.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.666
And I think that if something
like that happened now,

11:09.878 --> 11:10.867
you wouldn't do it again.

11:11.088 --> 11:12.624
You don't know what we owe them,

11:12.881 --> 11:14.212
especially Deucalion.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.877
We weren't like Kali and Ennis
when we met him.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.376
We weren't Alphas.

11:18.554 --> 11:19.714
What were you?

11:21.056 --> 11:22.045
Omegas.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.840
- Derek?
- Aiden, stop, please.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.925
- I'm right here, Derek.
- I'll scream.

11:27.146 --> 11:29.683
You want a fight, Derek?
Come and get me.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.230
In actual wolf packs,
Omegas are the scapegoat,

11:36.446 --> 11:37.356
the last to eat,

11:37.573 --> 11:39.689
the one who has
to take the abuse from the rest of the pack.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.732
So you and your brother were,
like, the bitches of the pack?

11:41.910 --> 11:43.195
Something like that.

11:43.412 --> 11:45.903
- What happened?
- They were killers.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.239
I mean, people talk about us as monsters.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.995
Well, they were the ones
who gave us the reputation.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.543
And our Alpha was the worst of them.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.208
Why didn't you guys just fight back?

11:56.425 --> 11:59.167
Form Voltron Wolf, you know?
Kick everyone's asses?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.672
We couldn't, we didn't know
how to control it back then.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.550
- Deucalion taught you.
- And then, we fought.

12:04.183 --> 12:06.265
We took down the whole pack, one-by-one.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.968
And by the time we got to our Alpha,
he was begging for his life.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.846
And we tore him apart.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.144
Literally.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.861
What about your emissary?

12:18.906 --> 12:21.488
They're all dead? Kali and Ennis', too?

12:21.742 --> 12:24.074
All of them except for Deucalion's.

12:24.328 --> 12:25.613
You mean Morell?

12:28.749 --> 12:30.159
What? What's wrong?
Are you hurt?

12:30.334 --> 12:32.165
Not me. My brother.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.928
Aiden, stop! Stop!

12:56.443 --> 12:57.808
Stop!

13:02.241 --> 13:04.197
Aiden, you can't do this!

13:04.409 --> 13:06.400
- She came at me!
- It doesn't matter!

13:06.662 --> 13:10.405
Kali gave Derek until the next full moon.
You can't touch him or her.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.432
Hey, guys, I think she's pretty hurt.

13:32.354 --> 13:35.187
Okay, okay, hold on a second.
Your dad's the killer?

13:35.399 --> 13:38.357
No. I mean, I don't think he is.
At least I hope he isn't.

13:38.568 --> 13:41.105
You hope he isn't
the serial-killing Dark Druid

13:41.321 --> 13:42.481
who's been slashing people's throats?

13:42.698 --> 13:43.562
- Yeah.
- Right.

13:43.782 --> 13:44.737
- Do you wanna help me or not?
- Yeah,

13:44.908 --> 13:47.320
I'm just trying to
get all the cards on the table here.

13:47.536 --> 13:48.696
See the marks?

13:48.870 --> 13:51.828
There are five more bodies to be found
but it doesn't say who the bodies are.

13:55.544 --> 13:56.784
What are you doing?

13:56.962 --> 14:00.375
Something I learned from my father.
Take a step back. Look at the whole picture.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.502
Sometimes, you see things
you wouldn't notice if you were up close

14:03.719 --> 14:06.335
when all you're looking at are the details.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.054
Look at that. You see that?

14:21.445 --> 14:22.355
Whoa.

14:22.571 --> 14:23.731
What is that?

14:23.947 --> 14:25.778
A five-fold knot.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.814
It's a Celtic symbol.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.698
Virgins.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.421
Warriors.

14:41.465 --> 14:42.625
Healers.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.382
Philosophers.

14:49.639 --> 14:50.719
Guardians.

15:07.449 --> 15:08.939
You okay?

15:09.159 --> 15:10.399
She doesn't look okay.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.079
|'|| heal.

15:14.915 --> 15:15.870
Whoa.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.910
I said I'm fine.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.663
Do you realize
how suicidally crazy that was?

15:20.879 --> 15:22.415
What were you thinking going after them?

15:22.631 --> 15:24.246
I did it for Boyd.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.957
None of you were doing anything.

15:27.469 --> 15:28.458
We're trying.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.963
And you're failing.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.338
You're just a bunch of stupid teenagers

15:33.600 --> 15:37.263
running around, thinking that
you can stop people from getting killed.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.178
But all you do is show up late.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.394
All you really do is find the bodies.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.562
She's definitely a Hale.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.694
I'll make sure she gets home.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.430
Where the hell have you been?

16:17.310 --> 16:18.720
Don't say that you needed
to be alone for a while

16:18.937 --> 16:20.438
because that is the single
worst excuse ever.

16:24.609 --> 16:25.519
Oh.

16:26.445 --> 16:28.106
God, I'm sorry.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.407
You really did need to be alone, didn't you?

16:32.826 --> 16:34.407
I'm here now.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.235
And you were safe. Trust me.

16:37.456 --> 16:38.741
I haven't felt safe,

16:39.249 --> 16:41.160
partially because the evil twins

16:41.376 --> 16:44.118
are walking around school
like nothing happened.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.168
They're not gonna hurt you.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.429
Some days, I just wanna take
a Sledgehammer to that bell.

16:56.641 --> 16:57.972
Why don't you just come back with me?

16:58.477 --> 16:59.557
I can't.

17:01.813 --> 17:05.397
I've got three more classes and I put
this recital together tonight.

17:05.609 --> 17:09.943
I organized it to honor
the losses at the school,

17:10.447 --> 17:13.610
and now, it just sounds really stupid,
doesn't it?

17:14.159 --> 17:15.114
No.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.241
It sounds perfect.

17:52.447 --> 17:56.110
Sorry, but I don't remember
having any more appointments.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.441
You sure?

17:57.661 --> 18:00.573
'Cause I could use
a little guidance right now.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.247
Philosophers?

18:05.460 --> 18:06.791
And guardians,
which after last night

18:06.962 --> 18:10.420
has to mean something
like law enforcement, right?

18:10.840 --> 18:13.502
Stiles, you have to tell your dad.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.050
Tell him whatever you need
but you have to get him to believe.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.257
Tell your dad. Warn him.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.429
Okay, okay, okay, I know.

18:21.476 --> 18:22.511
What are you gonna do?

18:22.727 --> 18:24.433
I'm gonna tell him the truth.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.891
And I'm gonna need your help.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.983
Why are you bothering with me, Scott,

18:32.153 --> 18:34.235
when you know the clock is ticking?

18:34.447 --> 18:37.280
When you know someone else
is about to be taken?

18:38.076 --> 18:40.533
- By you.
- Come on, Scott.

18:41.454 --> 18:45.242
Shouldn't you leave the interrogations
to someone like Stilinski?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.540
Are you the one killing people?

18:47.752 --> 18:50.539
Are you listening to my heartbeat?

18:54.467 --> 18:57.880
No. I'm not the one killing people.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.262
The truth is,

19:05.478 --> 19:09.062
I'm all that stands between
Deucalion and the lives of your friends.

19:09.357 --> 19:13.646
I've been the one pulling the leash taut
when they're salivating for a bite.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.235
What do you mean?

19:15.447 --> 19:17.233
He wants a true Alpha in his pack.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.235
He thinks it's you.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.942
And a little distraction
like a few human sacrifices

19:22.162 --> 19:25.074
isn't gonna dissuade him from the prize.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.237
I'm not an Alpha.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.073
But you're well on your way, aren't you?

19:28.251 --> 19:30.833
Then what is he waiting for?
What does he want me to do?

19:32.005 --> 19:35.338
He wants to make a killer out of you.

19:35.550 --> 19:38.257
That's what he does.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.838
But if I kill someone,
I can't be a true Alpha, right?

19:43.433 --> 19:44.548
Exactly.

19:46.478 --> 19:49.060
You want the psychologist's perspective?

19:49.230 --> 19:54.190
He's an obsessive who both desires
you and is threatened by you.

19:54.903 --> 19:59.363
If the obsessive can't have
the object of his desire,

19:59.574 --> 20:02.281
he'll choose to destroy it instead.

20:02.577 --> 20:05.785
You'll either willingly
become part of his pack,

20:05.997 --> 20:07.988
or he'll make a killer out of you,

20:08.208 --> 20:12.451
destroying your potential to be a true Alpha.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.704
Neither of those is ever going to happen.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.297
Don't be so sure.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.672
You're playing his game.

20:22.097 --> 20:26.181
And while you're trying to
figure out what to do next,

20:26.351 --> 20:28.433
he's thinking 10 moves ahead,

20:29.104 --> 20:32.437
with checkmate already in sight.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.811
I don't get why no one's calling the police.

21:56.024 --> 21:57.560
They're gonna make
an announcement over the PA.

21:57.776 --> 22:01.439
That's not gonna do anything!
I told you, he's gone.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.111
Like the others, taken.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.906
Okay. Look,
we're just trying to understand, okay?

22:07.118 --> 22:09.575
All we know is that
Mr. Westover didn't show up for class.

22:09.788 --> 22:11.995
And the last time
that happened was Mr. Harris.

22:12.207 --> 22:13.617
Anyone heard from him lately?

22:13.833 --> 22:14.868
He's gone.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.494
And he's going to be the second murder.

22:18.713 --> 22:20.578
But, Lydia, you wrote that number.

22:20.799 --> 22:22.289
Okay, fine.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.509
- I'm psychic.
- You're psychic?

22:27.597 --> 22:29.383
I'm something!

22:32.644 --> 22:34.726
A deputy and a teacher?

22:34.938 --> 22:36.428
What's the pattern?

22:38.483 --> 22:39.518
I don't know.

22:47.492 --> 22:50.609
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Yes, okay.

22:52.121 --> 22:53.497
- No...
- Stiles?

22:53.706 --> 22:56.618
Dad, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm just... I'm trying to...

22:56.835 --> 22:58.325
I'm just trying to figure out
how to start here.

22:58.503 --> 23:01.245
Hey, I don't have this kind of time.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.506
For the last year,

23:05.718 --> 23:08.425
you've had all these cases
that you couldn't figure out, right?

23:08.638 --> 23:10.720
I mean, all the murders
involving Kate Argent,

23:10.932 --> 23:12.968
and then Matt killing all
the people who had drowned him,

23:13.184 --> 23:14.924
and all these murders right now.

23:15.144 --> 23:17.760
It's like...
It's like you've been playing a losing game.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.972
Stiles, the last thing I need right now

23:20.191 --> 23:22.898
is a job performance review
from my own son.

23:23.862 --> 23:25.443
I know.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.818
Okay, see, but that's just it, Dad.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.319
The... The reason
that you're losing the game

23:31.494 --> 23:34.452
is 'cause you've never been able
to see the whole board.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.453
I need to show you the whole board.

23:45.842 --> 23:47.332
I have to stop him.

23:47.510 --> 23:50.252
Is that really a good idea?
If your dad is actually doing all this stuff...

23:50.430 --> 23:51.385
"If?"

23:52.140 --> 23:54.131
Look at this.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.386
He knows everything. He's...

23:56.561 --> 23:58.973
He's planned everything.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.807
- What are you doing?
- If Mr. Westover was taken from the school,

24:04.986 --> 24:06.942
there's gotta be another point
on the telluric current.

24:07.155 --> 24:08.986
You mean where he'll be sacrificed.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.331
There. That mark's new.

24:21.586 --> 24:23.497
Then that's where he is.

24:23.713 --> 24:27.956
Scott and Derek are werewolves?

24:28.176 --> 24:29.291
Yes.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.717
And Kate Argent was a werewolf?

24:31.930 --> 24:34.922
Hunter. That's... Purple's hunter.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.765
Along with Allison and her father.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.593
Yeah, and... And my friend Deaton,

24:40.813 --> 24:43.520
the veterinarian, is a Kanima?

24:43.733 --> 24:46.065
Well, no, no, no, no, no. He's a Druid, okay?

24:46.235 --> 24:48.362
Well, we think.

24:48.613 --> 24:50.274
- So who's the Kanima?
- Jackson.

24:50.490 --> 24:51.605
No, Jackson's a werewolf.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.951
Jackson was a Kanima first,
and then Peter and Derek killed him

24:54.160 --> 24:56.367
and he came back to life as a werewolf.
Now, he's in London.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.911
- Who's the Darack?
- It's "Darach."

24:59.207 --> 25:01.289
- We don't know yet.
- We don't know yet.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.207
But he was killed by werewolves?

25:03.419 --> 25:05.080
- Slashed up and left for dead.
- We think.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.036
We think. Yeah.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.875
Why was Jackson the Kanima?

25:13.096 --> 25:14.802
'Cause sometimes, the shape that you take

25:15.014 --> 25:16.675
reflects the person that you are.

25:17.892 --> 25:21.225
And what shape
would an increasingly confused

25:21.437 --> 25:24.520
and angrier-by-the-second father take?

25:24.691 --> 25:28.730
That would be more of an expression,
like the one you're currently wearing.

25:29.404 --> 25:30.644
Yeah.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.780
Dad... Dad, would you... I can prove it, okay?

25:34.492 --> 25:36.824
- She's one of them. A werewolf.
- Stiles, Stiles!

25:37.495 --> 25:38.701
That's enough.

25:40.832 --> 25:43.289
Dad, can you please just hold on?

25:44.502 --> 25:45.833
You ready?

25:47.505 --> 25:50.338
All right, Dad, just watch this, okay?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.595
Call an ambulance.

26:04.522 --> 26:06.638
You really don't think we should call Scott?

26:07.900 --> 26:10.186
Stay behind me and stay quiet.

26:13.865 --> 26:16.652
Oh... This is so not gonna end well.

26:35.511 --> 26:39.470
FYI, if your dad tries to kill me,
I'm gonna defend myself.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.891
If my dad tries to kill you, you'll be dead.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.178
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

26:51.861 --> 26:52.976
I smell blood.

26:53.196 --> 26:54.982
Where? What direction?

26:55.198 --> 26:58.190
I don't know. I'm not that good at this yet.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.449
But I think it's...

27:03.372 --> 27:04.327
Allison.

27:04.540 --> 27:05.916
Allison, wait.

27:13.508 --> 27:14.497
Allison, don't!

27:14.675 --> 27:15.630
Get down!

27:31.818 --> 27:33.024
Help him!

27:39.951 --> 27:41.441
That's Mr. Westover.

27:42.495 --> 27:43.860
It's our history teacher.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.196
We were wrong.
It's not guardians as in law enforcement.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.792
It's philosophers as in teachers.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.378
Allison and her father
just found Mr. Westover.

27:52.046 --> 27:53.877
That makes sense.
Tara, she wasn't always a cop.

27:54.090 --> 27:55.671
She used to teach middle school.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.423
Then the last one's
gonna be another teacher.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.921
Yeah, but there's dozens of them,
Scott, and they're all headed home.

28:02.515 --> 28:05.552
No. No, they're not.
They're all going to the recital.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.411
You've been tracking the killer
on your own this whole time?

28:28.624 --> 28:31.115
Yeah, and I was this close.

28:31.335 --> 28:33.200
Could've caught him if the two of you...

28:33.421 --> 28:34.706
So it's my fault?

28:34.922 --> 28:36.913
That you've been lying to me
for the past two months?

28:37.133 --> 28:38.293
You wanna tally up the lies, Allison?

28:38.509 --> 28:39.840
I don't think you're gonna
come out ahead on that one.

28:40.052 --> 28:40.916
Hey, just a thought?

28:41.137 --> 28:45.096
Maybe right now isn't the best
time for a little family meeting?

28:45.308 --> 28:48.175
- There's still one more teacher.
- The recital.

28:48.811 --> 28:50.517
Guess we're going, after all.

28:50.771 --> 28:53.513
What did you see the night at the bank
when Scott was trying to save Deaton?

28:53.691 --> 28:54.680
Nothing.

28:54.859 --> 28:58.272
Dad, you saw him healing himself
after he tried crossing the Mountain Ash.

28:58.487 --> 29:01.274
- I don't know what I saw.
- You saw something that you can't explain.

29:01.490 --> 29:04.732
Stiles, I have seen a lot of things
I can't explain in this town.

29:04.952 --> 29:07.910
That doesn't make 'em supernatural,
and it doesn't make 'em real.

29:09.290 --> 29:12.373
They just found another body.
That's real.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.291
And that's the lead I'm following.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.755
Dad, another teacher's gonna die
if you don't start listening to me.

29:16.923 --> 29:19.209
I am listening! I have been listening!

29:24.764 --> 29:26.379
You just don't believe.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.431
Mom would've believed me.

29:51.832 --> 29:54.619
- I know how to tie my own tie.
- Well, you know how to do it badly.

29:55.336 --> 29:57.122
Now, it's perfect.

30:08.224 --> 30:09.179
Still nervous?

30:09.392 --> 30:11.098
- All good.
- Okay.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.134
Listen.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.893
If anything happens, find me, okay?

30:19.026 --> 30:20.562
Find me first.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.295
I thought you were going home.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.459
I can't.

30:40.965 --> 30:44.457
I don't know why I am the one
that keeps finding the bodies,

30:45.511 --> 30:47.251
but maybe

30:48.264 --> 30:50.596
if I just stopped trying to fight it,

30:51.809 --> 30:53.470
I'd find them before it happens,

30:54.312 --> 30:56.428
maybe with enough time

30:56.647 --> 31:00.265
for someone like you
to do something about it.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.270
You get me the time,
and I'll do something about it.

31:02.486 --> 31:04.477
I swear to God, I will.

31:18.127 --> 31:19.242
Derek?

31:21.088 --> 31:22.339
Hey.

31:23.174 --> 31:24.630
Hey, I'm here.

31:25.968 --> 31:27.833
What's happening to me?

31:28.262 --> 31:29.502
I don't know.

31:31.307 --> 31:34.799
But I'm not leaving, okay? Not again.

31:46.113 --> 31:49.025
The records would be over 10 years old.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.857
I just need to look over a couple files.

31:52.036 --> 31:55.620
If this is about the murders,
you would need a court order for that.

31:59.168 --> 32:03.457
someone like me that's willing to
bend the rules for a handsome face.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.838
Give me the details. I'll see what I can do.

32:07.009 --> 32:08.124
Thank you.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.231
It better be.

33:24.253 --> 33:26.494
There was a patient just like you described.

33:26.714 --> 33:29.000
Slash marks all over the body.

33:29.175 --> 33:31.257
Doctors thought it had to be an animal.

33:31.469 --> 33:32.424
Oh.

33:33.387 --> 33:35.378
But there's something else.

33:35.681 --> 33:39.139
Something happened at the same
time that was even stranger.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.652
- What's up?
- Nothing.

33:56.869 --> 33:58.700
I just think I lost my phone.

34:00.498 --> 34:02.034
Birds?

34:02.249 --> 34:03.534
Hundreds of them.

34:03.751 --> 34:06.868
While the patient was in the
OR. Struggling to hold on,

34:07.087 --> 34:11.296
hundreds of birds were flying
into the walls, windows,

34:11.467 --> 34:13.799
like they were committing
some kind of mass suicide.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.176
Or like they were sacrificing themselves.

34:16.388 --> 34:17.377
For what?

34:17.765 --> 34:19.346
Not what.

34:20.434 --> 34:22.049
Who.

34:57.638 --> 34:59.629
You recognize it, don't you?

35:12.278 --> 35:14.485
- Lydia?
- Lydia!

35:18.867 --> 35:20.368
Anything?

35:22.288 --> 35:24.654
She's not answering texts. What do we do?

35:25.958 --> 35:27.368
Scott?

36:03.495 --> 36:04.996
What are you doing?

36:05.164 --> 36:06.449
What's necessary.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.995
I'm still surprised
none of you seem to get that.

36:10.294 --> 36:13.127
You call them sacrifices, but you're not

36:13.339 --> 36:15.000
understanding the word.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.089
It's derived from the Latin "sacrificium,"

36:18.260 --> 36:20.216
an offering to a deity,

36:20.429 --> 36:21.919
a sacred rite.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.425
A necessary evil.

36:25.142 --> 36:26.222
Stop.

36:26.435 --> 36:28.175
Oh, I wish I could.

36:28.437 --> 36:30.894
But you don't know the Alphas like I do.

36:31.398 --> 36:33.354
Please, stop.

36:34.443 --> 36:35.683
But you, Lydia,

36:36.737 --> 36:39.023
you're not a sacrifice.

36:39.198 --> 36:41.814
You're just a girl who knows too much.

36:42.993 --> 36:46.736
Actually, a girl who knew too much.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.332
- Lydia.
- Don't!

37:02.304 --> 37:03.589
Scott?

37:13.190 --> 37:14.771
Unbelievable.

37:17.111 --> 37:19.853
You have no idea what you are, do you?

37:20.406 --> 37:22.362
The wailing woman.

37:23.409 --> 37:26.526
A banshee, right before my eyes.

37:28.872 --> 37:31.454
You're just like me, Lydia.

37:31.667 --> 37:35.285
Look like the innocent flower,
but be the serpent under it.

37:37.673 --> 37:39.538
It's too bad, though.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.132
And too late.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.720
No, please!

38:00.904 --> 38:05.819
One last philosopher.

38:39.443 --> 38:40.899
Allison!

38:52.164 --> 38:53.654
Mistletoe.

38:56.710 --> 38:58.325
Drop it!

40:00.065 --> 40:01.521
There was a girl,

40:01.733 --> 40:04.941
years ago, we found her in the woods,

40:05.153 --> 40:07.610
her face and body slashed apart.

40:09.491 --> 40:10.992
That was you, wasn't it?

40:11.451 --> 40:13.658
Maybe I should've started
with philosophers,

40:13.871 --> 40:16.032
with knowledge and strategy.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.420
Healers.

40:31.471 --> 40:32.756
Warriors.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.429
Guardians.

40:40.731 --> 40:42.312
Virgins.

41:00.459 --> 41:01.790
Dad?
