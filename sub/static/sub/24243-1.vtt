10:28.383 --> 10:30.250
I had to break the window
to get in.

10:30.284 --> 10:32.119
Why didn't you
use the back door?

10:32.186 --> 10:34.588
I lost my keys
a couple... days ago.

10:37.025 --> 10:40.060
We'd been keeping the side door
open and when I got home...

10:41.094 --> 10:42.729
the door was locked.

10:43.264 --> 10:45.132
And so was the front door.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.067
OK.

10:49.070 --> 10:50.971
Do you have any idea

10:51.039 --> 10:53.240
why your wife might have
done this to herself?

10:53.274 --> 10:55.876
She was depressed.

10:59.614 --> 11:02.616
She said she'd rather be dead
than be married to me.

11:03.650 --> 11:05.118
Did you fight a lot?

11:05.153 --> 11:08.488
Yes... recently.

11:08.556 --> 11:11.258
Were these fights
ever violent?

11:11.292 --> 11:13.927
No. No.

11:14.561 --> 11:16.163
No, they were not.

11:16.230 --> 11:18.231
How far along was she?

11:24.906 --> 11:27.674
She was... 12 weeks.

11:27.742 --> 11:29.710
Oh, God.

11:29.777 --> 11:31.978
I asked her... I asked her

11:32.013 --> 11:33.980
to get help and she
just lashed out.

11:34.048 --> 11:36.583
She was angry with you?

11:38.919 --> 11:41.354
I wanted the baby.
She was so...

11:43.925 --> 11:46.526
She was so overwhelmed
with our kids

11:46.594 --> 11:48.528
and her job and...

11:50.598 --> 11:52.999
My brother's son needed a place
to stay. I let him move in

11:53.067 --> 11:55.869
to the basement. She didn't
want him there. I...

11:55.903 --> 11:58.205
I really thought we
were on the track...

11:58.272 --> 12:00.707
back to being happy again.

12:00.775 --> 12:03.176
Did anybody else
know she was pregnant?

12:03.211 --> 12:05.378
Friends, neighbours?

12:05.446 --> 12:08.715
Just her doctor. Why?

12:09.283 --> 12:11.318
Because she had been subject

12:11.352 --> 12:13.854
to a blunt-force trauma
to the abdomen.

12:14.621 --> 12:16.556
Like she'd been kicked.

12:18.860 --> 12:20.827
Can you walk us
through your morning?

12:20.862 --> 12:23.330
We can confirm when you left
your house, but did anybody

12:23.364 --> 12:26.900
see you at the hospital before
your surgery was cancelled?

your nephew?

12:40.414 --> 12:43.016
Where was he this morning?

12:43.050 --> 12:46.219
I don't know.

12:46.254 --> 12:48.455

- No. It's just looking

know it. Computer's clean,

13:11.712 --> 13:14.781
no porn at all.
All he reads are manuals.

13:14.849 --> 13:17.284
OK. Well, what
about that lotion?

That's not for dry skin.

Never worked, though.

- What?

13:33.935 --> 13:35.802
What is it?

13:35.837 --> 13:39.105
You were right.
The kid is definitely a perv.

a break there. Hm?

♪

21:19.388 --> 21:20.456
Are you OK?

21:20.490 --> 21:22.458
Never better.
Let's finish him.

21:22.492 --> 21:25.160
Finish him for what? Do you
remember why we're in there?

21:25.194 --> 21:27.296
- Yeah, of course I do.
- Are you sure?

21:27.331 --> 21:29.298
You heard the way he
was talking back there.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.601
Yes, about a woman
he slept with. Not you.

21:31.635 --> 21:33.603
OK, please don't
make me pretend

21:33.637 --> 21:35.638
that he is some amazing guy,
'cause I really can't.

21:35.672 --> 21:38.341
OK, then maybe you should
go for a walk until you can.

21:38.408 --> 21:40.276
You're kicking me off
the interview?

21:40.310 --> 21:42.311
No. I am asking you
to take a deep breath,

21:42.346 --> 21:44.180
clear your head and walk.

21:44.214 --> 21:47.683
- You're being unreasonable!
- And you are walking. Goodbye.

21:52.756 --> 21:55.358
(sighing)

21:57.992 --> 22:00.696
Yeah, hi.
This is Detective Jac Cooper.

22:00.764 --> 22:02.565
I need you to run
a vehicle for me.

22:02.633 --> 22:06.135
License plate alpha zeta

22:06.669 --> 22:08.804
Owner is Marc Savage.

22:08.839 --> 22:11.307
Yeah, I'll definitely hold.

22:15.765 --> 22:17.865
Are we having a talk
with the mistress yet?

22:17.890 --> 22:20.592
- We've been on the husband.
- According to Dr. Rashi,

22:20.660 --> 22:22.427
- she didn't know Alina was pregnant.
- Mhm.

22:22.495 --> 22:24.663
Where is she now?
She's a nurse

22:24.697 --> 22:27.099
at the same hospital as Rashi.
We're heading there now.

22:27.666 --> 22:30.268
OK, good. Jac, you go.
Take Finch with you.

22:30.336 --> 22:32.103
Stevie, you wanna
hang back a minute?

22:32.171 --> 22:34.372
Wow.

22:34.406 --> 22:36.474
I'm punted for Aaron Finch?

22:36.542 --> 22:38.376
Guess it pays off
to be the judge's son.

22:38.410 --> 22:40.912
I have to be political.
Blame my vagina.

22:40.946 --> 22:43.381
Everyone else does.

22:43.415 --> 22:46.351
So, um... what's goin' on
with you and Jac?

22:46.385 --> 22:49.220
I heard you asked her
to leave the interview.

22:49.254 --> 22:53.057
- I didn't think I needed her.
- But you worked pretty hard

22:53.125 --> 22:56.294
to convince me that we did.
You still feel that way?

22:58.998 --> 23:01.132
(distant sirens blaring)

23:04.536 --> 23:06.771
It was just a fling.

23:06.805 --> 23:08.773
I didn't even
know he was married.

23:09.307 --> 23:11.308
By the time he told me,

23:11.343 --> 23:13.611
I mean, I was mad, but...

23:13.678 --> 23:15.779
How is he?

23:15.814 --> 23:18.482
God, those poor kids.

23:18.517 --> 23:21.752
Let's... stay on you.

When you broke up,

23:24.055 --> 23:26.257
how'd that make you feel?

23:26.291 --> 23:28.526
We work together.

23:28.594 --> 23:30.561
I didn't wanna
seem unprofessional.

23:33.165 --> 23:35.066
I didn't wanna be one
of those women who spiral

23:35.100 --> 23:37.835
because of a guy. It's pathetic.

23:37.903 --> 23:41.506
But you threatened
to tell his wife.

23:41.573 --> 23:43.708
Let's get something straight.

23:43.742 --> 23:46.177
I ended it.

23:46.245 --> 23:49.013
He would've kept
stringing me along otherwise,

23:49.081 --> 23:51.115
even after she got pregnant.

23:51.950 --> 23:54.252
So you knew his wife
was pregnant?

23:54.286 --> 23:57.488
Yeah. It's all he
ever complained about.

23:57.523 --> 24:00.191
He didn't want any more kids.

24:00.259 --> 24:02.493
He told her to get rid of it.

24:02.528 --> 24:05.563
So their relationship
was fraught.

24:05.597 --> 24:07.532
Yeah, I'll say.

24:07.599 --> 24:10.201
He said he felt trapped.

24:10.935 --> 24:13.337
And that he'd...
if he'd ever leave,

24:13.372 --> 24:15.173
he'd still have to pay
for everything:

24:15.207 --> 24:17.809
the kids, the house.

24:17.843 --> 24:19.944
It just got too real.

24:19.978 --> 24:21.979
That's why I ended it.

24:22.014 --> 24:25.216
You ever go to his house?
Meet his wife?

24:25.284 --> 24:27.752
No way. I could never.

24:27.786 --> 24:30.888
It was just a couple times
in the office.

24:31.756 --> 24:33.958
And once in his car.

24:36.895 --> 24:39.063
I know how I may seem,

24:39.098 --> 24:42.500

Apparently, she didn't wanna

25:05.824 --> 25:08.359

All right, everybody.
Listen up.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.566
The underwear found
on the nephew have come back

25:14.600 --> 25:16.319
and Alina Rashi's
DNA is confirmed.

25:16.744 --> 25:18.036
He's admitted to stealing them.

25:18.070 --> 25:19.664
Did he admit to killing her?

25:19.689 --> 25:21.076
No, but he has asked
for a lawyer,

25:21.101 --> 25:24.163
<i>so I won't be surprised if
he starts asking for a deal.</i>

25:25.188 --> 25:28.413
Bravo to you. You found
the underwear. Thank you.

25:28.447 --> 25:31.216
That was useful.

25:31.750 --> 25:33.951
Well, what do you
think of that?

25:36.421 --> 25:39.624
I'd still like to know
where these flowers came from.

25:46.899 --> 25:49.000
Don't worry, Hall. I'll be
out of your hair in a minute.

25:49.035 --> 25:51.269

to go to, actually.

25:51.804 --> 25:53.605
Celebrating my award.

25:54.639 --> 25:56.508
Wasn't that ceremony
like a month ago?

25:57.142 --> 25:59.477
Is there a statute
of limitations on dinner

25:59.545 --> 26:00.653
that I wasn't aware of?

26:00.678 --> 26:03.435
Why don't you just admit
you've been dodging it?

26:03.460 --> 26:05.948
I'm sure Jono's got a nice
meal planned for you.

26:05.973 --> 26:07.118
That is why you liked him.

26:07.153 --> 26:08.618
No, I liked him because
he's a good man,

26:08.643 --> 26:10.502
and because he
didn't have a badge.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.424
That's what you always said.

26:12.958 --> 26:14.893
- Let's not do this.
- Do what?

26:15.427 --> 26:17.929
Pretend like we have something
to say to each other.

26:17.963 --> 26:20.165
Look, I know the way that we
ended it was not ideal--

26:20.232 --> 26:22.801
You ended it, Stevie. You just
forgot to tell me is all.

26:22.835 --> 26:24.803
Oh, give me a break.
We were kids. We were messing around.

26:24.837 --> 26:28.039
You went off to re-certify.
I had to make a choice.

26:30.009 --> 26:32.010
Why don't you blow off dinner,
come get a drink with me?

26:34.646 --> 26:36.613
(door opening)

26:36.648 --> 26:39.017
Boss, I think
I found something.

26:39.085 --> 26:41.686
OK.

26:45.724 --> 26:47.192
For old time's sake.

26:47.959 --> 26:50.394
Have a good night, Price.

26:58.771 --> 27:01.039
The hospital gave me
Michelle's work schedule.

27:01.107 --> 27:04.509
She'd mentioned picking up some
extra shifts, and now I see why.

27:06.043 --> 27:07.911
- She took last month off?
- Mhm.

27:07.946 --> 27:08.913
- Interesting.
- Isn't it?

27:08.948 --> 27:12.217
I also seized her phone records.
Know who that number belongs to?

27:12.284 --> 27:14.252
OK, stop showing off
and just say it.

27:14.286 --> 27:16.141
Morgentaler Abortion Clinic.

27:16.166 --> 27:18.246
Michelle had an
appointment a month ago.

27:18.290 --> 27:20.658
Oh, I thought you
felt bad for her. But now,

27:20.693 --> 27:23.728
here you are, investigating her.
I should've known.

27:23.763 --> 27:25.597
She seemed so calm when Aaron
and I interviewed her

27:25.631 --> 27:27.465
and after what Hickman did,
it just didn't make sense.

27:27.500 --> 27:30.068
Blunt-force trauma to the vic's
abdomen seemed motivated.

27:30.102 --> 27:32.237
Maybe it was motivated
by the abortion.

27:32.304 --> 27:33.571
Not bad.

27:33.606 --> 27:35.874
And Dean said he heard
his uncle screaming at Alina

27:35.908 --> 27:37.842
about the pregnancy, but...

27:37.877 --> 27:39.978
what if it wasn't his wife
Hickman was yelling at?

27:40.012 --> 27:42.747
He could've been
on the phone to Michelle.

27:42.815 --> 27:44.241
Have you told Fiona?

27:44.266 --> 27:47.152
Not until
I figure out how she got in.

27:55.323 --> 27:57.991
I bet you have a pool,
you bastard.

28:09.171 --> 28:11.672
Hi. I'm Jac.

28:11.740 --> 28:13.641
I just thought you should know,

28:13.675 --> 28:15.676
you are married

28:15.711 --> 28:17.712
- to a cheating piece of crap.
- Hello.

28:20.515 --> 28:22.416
Can I help you?

28:22.450 --> 28:23.984
Uh... hi.

28:26.855 --> 28:29.190
Detective Cooper. I just wanted

28:29.224 --> 28:31.726
to let you know
hat there was a break-in

28:31.793 --> 28:34.328
- in the area.
- Oh, my God.

28:34.362 --> 28:36.831
Yeah, and...

28:36.865 --> 28:40.534
do you mind if I come in
and ask you a couple questions?

28:43.105 --> 28:45.506
I was called in
to help with the canvassing.

28:45.540 --> 28:48.242
But, you know what,
maybe we should just

28:48.310 --> 28:50.111
- wait for my superior.
- No, please!

28:50.145 --> 28:52.880
Come in. You can wait in here.

28:56.618 --> 28:59.253
It's been quiet all night.
It goes to show you,

28:59.321 --> 29:01.255
you never quite know the truth.

29:01.323 --> 29:03.824
Yeah, well, sometimes
it's better that way.

29:07.295 --> 29:09.363
I'm... sorry,

29:09.431 --> 29:11.232
are there children in the house?

29:11.299 --> 29:13.145
Yes, our son, Peter.

29:13.270 --> 29:15.402
He's asleep. I don't
need to wake him, do I?

29:15.536 --> 29:18.272
No. I'm... sorry.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.608
I'm sorry.

29:20.642 --> 29:22.777
How long have you lived here?

29:22.811 --> 29:24.945
- Seven years.
- You've been together

29:25.013 --> 29:27.848
- for seven years?
- Well, no. Married for seven.

29:27.883 --> 29:29.850
We've actually been
together for 10.

29:29.885 --> 29:33.320
Oh. That is a long time.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.790
Yeah, I know.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.958
I'm lucky I caught a stable one.

29:37.993 --> 29:40.094
Sweetie! I thought
you were staying

29:40.128 --> 29:42.096
in the city tonight.
This is Detective Cooper.

29:42.164 --> 29:46.567
There's been a break-in a few
houses down. Detective Cooper,

29:46.635 --> 29:48.402
this is my husband, Marc Savage.

29:48.436 --> 29:50.304
Well, it's nice to meet you,

you've got here.

29:56.278 --> 29:58.112
Detective Cooper, wait.

29:58.146 --> 30:01.048
I just have one more question
about the break-in.

30:06.288 --> 30:08.289
So you come to my house?

30:08.323 --> 30:10.524
Yeah. And you have a kid!

30:11.559 --> 30:13.260
Look, I know
how much this hurts--

30:13.295 --> 30:17.064
Hurts?! Oh, no.
I am way past hurt.

30:17.131 --> 30:18.433
I am furious.

30:18.758 --> 30:20.150
And you're gonna
make it up to me.

30:20.675 --> 30:21.959
I want the condo.

30:22.869 --> 30:24.505
You can't... be serious.

30:24.573 --> 30:25.632
Okie doke.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.637
Let's go see what your wife has
to say about it, shall we?

32:56.290 --> 32:58.392
I don't know, I just...

32:59.426 --> 33:00.994
guess I wanted to see
what was worth

33:01.028 --> 33:03.163
- giving me up for.
<i>- This is bad.</i>

33:03.697 --> 33:06.332
Yeah, I know. I broke an oath.
But I mean,

33:06.367 --> 33:09.535
what was I supposed to do to get
in there? Buy her flowers?

33:09.603 --> 33:12.572
(dramatic music)

33:12.640 --> 33:13.940
♪

33:14.008 --> 33:16.009
That's how she did it.

33:17.784 --> 33:20.684
(siren wailing)
(indistinct police radio chatter)

33:22.109 --> 33:25.111
You sure she should be taking
the lead on this, not you?

33:25.145 --> 33:27.814
OK. She figured out the
flowers were from the hospital

33:28.148 --> 33:30.683
and she built the connection
between Michelle. It's hers.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.085
Only if she gets a confession.

33:36.123 --> 33:38.224
Michelle, why did you tell us
that you'd never been

33:38.292 --> 33:40.059
to Alina Rashi's residence?

33:40.094 --> 33:42.862
I was too scared
to tell you the truth...

33:42.897 --> 33:45.498
because of what
happened to Alina...

33:45.533 --> 33:47.500
I thought you would
think it was me.

33:47.535 --> 33:49.536
And why did you go
to Alina's home?

33:50.470 --> 33:52.338
Was it to bring her flowers?

33:52.373 --> 33:55.008
I wanted to apologize.

33:55.042 --> 33:57.977
I wanted to tell her
the truth me and Hickman.

33:58.012 --> 34:00.046
I... I never hurt her.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.649
So walk me through it, then.

34:03.783 --> 34:05.251
You arrived at the house...

34:05.319 --> 34:07.520
I... I knocked on the door...

34:08.355 --> 34:10.857
but when she answered,
I lost my nerve.

34:11.591 --> 34:14.260
You don't know how hard
it's gonna be once you're there,

34:14.295 --> 34:17.196
- face to face.
- You froze.

34:18.031 --> 34:20.533
I handed her
the flowers and ran.

34:21.467 --> 34:23.603
Why did you wanna tell Alina

34:23.670 --> 34:25.538
about you and Hickman so badly?

34:28.809 --> 34:30.842
Was it because of the abortion?

34:32.813 --> 34:34.714
That's why you took
all that time off work.

34:34.748 --> 34:37.250
Isn't it?

34:38.719 --> 34:40.920
After I got pregnant,

34:40.955 --> 34:43.489
he told me I had
my whole life ahead of me.

34:46.694 --> 34:48.661
He didn't want another baby.

34:48.696 --> 34:50.964
I thought she deserved to know

34:50.998 --> 34:52.699
what type of guy
she was married to.

34:56.036 --> 34:58.438
The doors were all
dead-bolted or chained

34:58.463 --> 35:00.471
when Hickman
found Alina's body.

35:00.496 --> 35:02.742
Only person who
could've done that

35:02.776 --> 35:04.777
would have keys.

35:04.812 --> 35:07.313
Now, I think that
eliminates you right there.

35:07.348 --> 35:08.583
What the hell is she doing?

35:08.608 --> 35:10.917
She just gave her her defense!
Did you see that?

35:10.951 --> 35:13.486
But... for a second,

35:13.520 --> 35:15.421
let's just go back
to when you got the flowers.

35:15.456 --> 35:18.157
In that moment, your intention

35:18.225 --> 35:20.093
was to tell Alina
about you and Hickman, correct?

35:20.127 --> 35:22.795
- Yes, that's right.
- Now, why would you buy someone

35:22.830 --> 35:25.565
flowers to tell them something
devastating like that?

35:27.568 --> 35:29.836
I felt guilty.

35:29.903 --> 35:31.838
Ashamed.

35:32.472 --> 35:34.524
I wanted to make it up
to her somehow.

35:34.549 --> 35:35.708
I know it sounds stupid.

35:35.743 --> 35:37.644
You know what I think?

35:38.478 --> 35:40.146
I think you brought

35:40.180 --> 35:42.148
the flowers so you
could get inside.

35:42.216 --> 35:44.150
What?

35:44.184 --> 35:46.986
You wanted to see
what his life was like.

35:47.021 --> 35:49.022
His home, his wife,

35:49.089 --> 35:52.925
the books on his shelf; see what
it was that you were missing.

35:54.928 --> 35:56.863
Maybe I was a little curious,

35:56.930 --> 35:58.865
- but...
- No.

35:58.932 --> 36:01.200
You were consumed.

36:01.235 --> 36:03.202
But I don't blame you.

36:03.270 --> 36:05.304
I would be too.

36:05.339 --> 36:07.340
It's difficult,

36:07.374 --> 36:10.543
getting inside of someone
else's home. Isn't it?

36:10.611 --> 36:12.412
You have to build a trust.

36:12.479 --> 36:15.048
It'd be easy
if you could just...

36:15.115 --> 36:18.885
tell Alina you were a cop.
But you're not.

36:18.952 --> 36:21.387
You do have

36:21.455 --> 36:23.890
a hospital ID, though.

36:23.924 --> 36:25.858
You could've told her
that you worked at the hospital.

36:25.893 --> 36:28.561
Sweet, attractive,

36:28.629 --> 36:30.697
mild-mannered woman
from the hospital.

36:30.764 --> 36:34.000
Why would anyone assume
that you had ulterior motives?

36:34.034 --> 36:36.235
- You're wrong.
- Trouble is...

36:36.303 --> 36:38.438
once you got in there,

36:38.505 --> 36:41.307
you saw something
that you weren't prepared for.

36:43.577 --> 36:45.878
When I was at the crime scene,
I noticed

36:45.913 --> 36:48.648
a brand-new bassinet sitting in
the corner of the living room.

36:51.885 --> 36:54.854
He didn't tell you
she was pregnant, did he?

36:54.888 --> 36:58.858
It must've hurt like hell
to find out like that.

36:58.892 --> 37:01.094
It's not like that.

37:01.128 --> 37:02.995
Then what is it like?

37:03.030 --> 37:05.565
Because right now,
it's your word against his.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.533
Are you a crazy bitch?

37:07.568 --> 37:09.602
Is that why he didn't
wanna have kids with you?

37:09.670 --> 37:12.405
