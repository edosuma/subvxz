00:56.720 --> 00:57.710
Have a seat.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.755
Now this is highly irregular, Agent Thorn.

01:07.040 --> 01:10.078
Never had to recall this type of
specialist back into active service.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.839
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.871
Saved more lives than
he could possibly know.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.078
Smart, loyal, keen military instincts.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.200
Best I ever served with.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.396
And the family?

01:25.600 --> 01:26.750
Very supportive.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.515
No, the Wincotts are
military through and through.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.391
They were only happy to lend him to us.

01:34.160 --> 01:38.157
He looks good on paper, but he's
been out of the game for a while.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.674
How do we know he's still got it?

01:50.920 --> 01:52.036
Agent Thorn,

01:52.880 --> 01:54.109
meet Max.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.517
Welcome to the Secret Service, Max.

02:12.680 --> 02:16.396
And Russian president Vladimir Bragov
will be arriving later this week

02:16.560 --> 02:20.236
to attend President Bennett's
first state visit since taking office,

02:20.400 --> 02:22.869
an event that's set to kick
off a full week of arms

02:23.080 --> 02:26.073
negotiations at presidential
retreat Camp David.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.471
These two leaders
couldn't be more different.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.474
The question remains
if Bennett's laid-back style

02:31.640 --> 02:33.871
can handle Bragov's stronger,

02:34.080 --> 02:35.070
- more aggressive stance.
- What?

02:35.280 --> 02:36.396
Critics will be watching...

02:37.400 --> 02:38.595
Stronger?

02:39.920 --> 02:44.114
Just because the Kremlin cowboy hunts
tigers, it doesn't make him strong.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.830
Dad, can I talk to you about something?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.480
It's about school.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.710
Look, these things, they just take time.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.439
You're the new kid on the block.

02:57.600 --> 03:01.954
Look, TJ. Why don't you invite some of
your new friends over to the White House?

03:02.160 --> 03:04.834
I mean, how many kids your age
have their own bowling alley?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.640
No, I'd love to invite
my new friends over.

03:08.640 --> 03:09.994
If I had any.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.795
Okay, you know, it's kind of
hard to make friends

03:13.000 --> 03:16.277
when every time someone comes
up to you, they get frisked.

03:16.960 --> 03:21.716
We know this is hard, TJ.
It's a big adjustment for all of us.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.076
It's more than just an adjustment, Mom.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.799
It's like living in a fish bowl,

03:25.960 --> 03:27.997
and I'm the only one
who didn't ask for this.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.120
Son.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.314
There have been a lot of kids

03:36.480 --> 03:39.120
who grew up here,
and I'm sure every single one of them

03:39.320 --> 03:41.710
felt exactly the way you do right now.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.237
But I will bet that
they wouldn't trade that experience

03:45.400 --> 03:46.914
for anything in the world.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.516
You know, so,

03:50.680 --> 03:55.030
maybe, do your mom and I a favor
and just try to give it a chance.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.270
I guess.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.039
That's the Bennett spirit!

04:07.080 --> 04:08.150
Go have a good day.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.630
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.793
Baby bird, hold on.

04:14.800 --> 04:15.916
Don't forget your lunch.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.920
Baby bird? Seriously?

04:21.160 --> 04:23.880
Oh, man. I've gotta get
a cooler code name.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.714
Hey! You're new here.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.749
And well-trained!

04:40.520 --> 04:42.432
Well, I guess I know what you want.

04:42.680 --> 04:43.875
Who's a good boy?

04:44.040 --> 04:46.396
Who likes his belly rubbed?

04:47.160 --> 04:49.470
- What's your name, fella?
- His name is Max.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.992
And he's not here to play.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.240
I wasn't playing with him,
Agent Thorn. I was just...

04:56.560 --> 04:59.871
Okay, maybe I was
playing with him a little.

05:00.680 --> 05:01.716
What's he doing here?

05:01.880 --> 05:05.237
Max is one of the country's
highest-trained tactical canines.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.631
He's been called to duty
to replace Charlie,

05:07.800 --> 05:09.029
who's out on maternity leave.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.712
Hmm. Charlie's a girl?

05:13.720 --> 05:14.836
Let's go, Max.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.397
Now, if you'll excuse us.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.234
We have work to do.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.190
Max, come.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.760
Nice to meet you, Max.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.629
Good luck in the fish bowl.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.074
Hail to the geek.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.439
You know that's cheating, right?

06:54.840 --> 06:57.116
Does anyone want to trade for a PB&J?

07:08.320 --> 07:09.993
Hit me! You can hit me!

07:10.680 --> 07:13.036
Come on! They're not gonna
do anything to you.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.312
Come on! You can hit me! Someone hit me!

07:16.720 --> 07:18.393
No!

07:25.240 --> 07:27.800
And fun fact number 41...

07:27.960 --> 07:29.189
It's TJ.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.473
It's First Son, TJ Bennett.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.512
I told you we might get lucky today.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.994
I love you, TJ!

07:43.560 --> 07:46.560
It's bad enough that I had to dance
with my mom at the inauguration.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.837
But now I'm a part of the tour, Coop.
I live here

07:49.000 --> 07:52.835
but I feel like I'm on exhibit
365 days a year.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.835
At least a gorilla in the zoo
gets Christmas off.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.680
Look at the bright side, T.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.196
At the zoo, they don't let
you feed the animals.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.230
Think about it.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.310
Worst case, you're only gonna
be here for eight more years.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.439
Less if your dad gets impeached.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.039
Thanks for cheering me up, Coop.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.112
I do hear what you're saying, T.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.234
But for some reason, they put a really
high value on security here.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.600
Did you know that they X-ray
everything that comes into the kitchen?

08:19.760 --> 08:20.830
Even the grapes.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.229
I mean, what can you hide in a grape?

08:22.400 --> 08:23.629
But it's not just that.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.076
I miss my old life, my old friends.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.959
I didn't run for office, you know.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.279
Might just grow on you, T.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.433
Why do you think so many presidents' sons
go into the family business?

08:35.080 --> 08:37.754
Like you said, at least
the food's good here.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.913
I mean, what do you put
in these things anyway?

08:41.120 --> 08:44.078
Secret ingredient. Hold on.
That one's still probably

08:44.240 --> 08:46.550
- a little bit hot.
- Hot! Hot!

08:52.120 --> 08:53.634
Hey, Max! Come here, boy!

08:53.840 --> 08:55.433
Come here, boy!

08:57.160 --> 08:58.196
Hi.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.192
Good boy.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.720
We'll get right on that.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.918
I want someone on the ground
at 0800 hours for this situation.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.992
Hey, TJ.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.556
Who's your new friend?

09:08.720 --> 09:10.313
Sit, Max, sit!

09:10.960 --> 09:15.079
Good boy. Meet Max, our newest addition
to the White House staff.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.160
Well, hello, Max.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.310
I hope I can count on your
vote in the next election.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.832
Oh! Yes! What a good boy!

09:26.080 --> 09:27.799
Yes, what a good boy!

09:28.000 --> 09:29.798
Uh, Dad, I don't think

09:30.000 --> 09:32.515
Agent Thorn wants anyone to
be playing with Max like this.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.670
TJ, come on.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.998
I'm the President of the United States.
I'm pretty sure petting any dog

09:37.160 --> 09:39.550
I want is in the constitution.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.069
Isn't that right, Max?

09:41.240 --> 09:43.197
Yeah, isn't that right?

09:43.360 --> 09:44.874
Mr. President,

09:45.120 --> 09:48.950
I apologize. Our new security canine
shouldn't have left his station.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.555
We're still getting him up to
speed on his duties here.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.598
Good, then it's not too late.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.233
Too late for what, sir?

09:56.400 --> 09:58.278
To add a few more duties.

09:58.440 --> 10:01.319
Like playing with TJ on his off hours.

10:02.800 --> 10:06.510
Sir, as head of White House security,
I must voice my concerns.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.752
This is an important week.
And I would hate for the dog to get

10:09.960 --> 10:11.952
confused about his purpose here.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.634
Noted, Agent Thorn.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.071
But I'm sure a man with your abilities

10:16.240 --> 10:19.233
can find a way to accommodate
this simple request.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.280
Otherwise, I'd have to
issue an executive order.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.193
Get the Supreme Court involved.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.113
You know, it can get really messy.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.880
Of course, Mr. President.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.472
Thank you, Agent Thorn.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.554
Well, you see that, TJ?

10:37.120 --> 10:39.760
This morning, I told you
things would turn around for you here.

10:39.920 --> 10:43.152
And President Bennett always
delivers on his promises.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.880
Thank you, Dad. Come on, Max!

10:48.240 --> 10:49.469
Come on, Max! Let's go!

11:03.920 --> 11:06.389
War hero, veteran, and now Secret Service?

11:06.600 --> 11:07.795
Tactical canine Max

11:07.960 --> 11:11.874
is on loan to the White House this week
to help out with the Russian state visit.

11:12.040 --> 11:15.511
And by the looks of things,
he's making himself quite at home.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.515
Who wants the ball? Who wants the ball?

11:19.680 --> 11:20.909
Who wants the ball?

11:23.840 --> 11:25.240
Hey!

11:28.280 --> 11:29.873
Good boy!

12:13.640 --> 12:14.915
Let's go, Max.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.471
- I'm TJ.
- Alfred.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.752
- Max, security detail.
- Cool.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.590
Lunch today?

12:37.160 --> 12:39.072
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

12:42.960 --> 12:43.950
That's cool.

12:52.320 --> 12:55.552
Mom, Dad, can I go to a party tonight?
A kid at school invited me.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.712
Oh. I'm sorry, honey.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.072
Tonight really isn't
the best time for this.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.517
TJ, you know that the Russian
president is gonna be here...

13:04.720 --> 13:06.040
What's that gotta do with me?

13:07.360 --> 13:10.432
Look, I know that this
has been really difficult,

13:10.640 --> 13:14.998
but we are the First Family and that
job has responsibilities.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.280
And you know what?
We were hoping that you could help us out.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.350
See, President Bragov's
wife couldn't make the trip,

13:21.520 --> 13:23.637
but he is bringing his kid, Alex,

13:23.800 --> 13:26.235
- who just happens to be about your age.
- Wait.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.870
So you want me to babysit
some Russian kid?

13:29.560 --> 13:31.950
Well, we were hoping that
you would see it more as

13:32.160 --> 13:34.470
being our "goodwill ambassador."

13:34.760 --> 13:36.399
Well, I was hoping

13:36.560 --> 13:39.553
I would have a vote
on anything that goes on in my life.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.360
It's not fair and there's no
way I'm dressing up

13:42.520 --> 13:45.831
in a fancy outfit and smiling
for the cameras

13:46.000 --> 13:47.957
just so you can get your poll numbers up.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.991
Look, I'm sorry, nope.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.312
I am just not doing it.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.760
- TJ, what is on your face?
- Mom.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.593
- Mom!
- Hey, hey, hey!

14:13.920 --> 14:16.480
Dad, she's a girl.

14:17.400 --> 14:22.873
Yes, Alex is short for Alexandra.
I hope that's not a problem.

14:23.680 --> 14:27.959
President Bragov, it is an honor to
have you here as my guest.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.110
Honor?

14:29.520 --> 14:31.989
You seem to have changed
your tune since campaign

14:32.160 --> 14:34.072
when you called me, what was it?

14:34.560 --> 14:37.917
"Crazy Kremlin cowboy."

14:42.560 --> 14:45.120
You must be tired, let me
show you your quarters.

14:55.840 --> 14:58.514
- He seems nice.
- Yeah.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.637
I'm supposed to be nice to you.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.156
I am to be polite, nothing more.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.959
My name is Alexandra Bragov,
but you may call me Alex.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.110
I'm TJ.

15:13.320 --> 15:15.835
I know, I had briefing about you.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.311
They say you are very
resourceful and fine player of baseball.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.479
Also a big fan of spy movies

15:21.640 --> 15:24.553
and always eat ice cream too
fast and get brain freeze.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.160
They know all that about me?

15:26.360 --> 15:28.955
My papa's people are very thorough.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.756
- But no mention of dog.
- Oh.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.149
This is Max.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.000
But he's not my dog.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.876
I mean, I guess he is now,

15:38.080 --> 15:41.152
- but, um, not later or before.
- Do you know what breed he is?

15:41.320 --> 15:43.152
Oh, he's a Secret Service dog.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.198
I mean, I know it's not a breed.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.670
- He's a...
- Belgian Malinois.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.196
How'd you know that?

15:49.360 --> 15:52.876
I am, how you say? Dog person.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.639
Oh, yeah? Me too.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.078
Tell them to put that in my file.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.951
So, TJ, do you think your "dog-for-now"

16:04.120 --> 16:07.955
could help us sniff out something
to eat other than boring state dinner?

16:09.280 --> 16:11.033
I think I know just the place.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.477
Oh! No, no, you nudnik!

16:17.640 --> 16:20.917
In borscht, we slice
beets thin like paper.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.554
- My president...
- Dimitri!

16:32.480 --> 16:33.516
I misspoke.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.275
It is honor to be in
such beautiful kitchen.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.634
Even if you do not belong here.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.239
I assume he came with you?

16:43.080 --> 16:44.070
Hey, Coop.

16:44.280 --> 16:45.999
Meet Alex, she's from Russia.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.839
Call me Coop, I'm from Brighton Beach.

16:48.000 --> 16:48.990
Pleasure.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.470
Say, Coop,

16:51.440 --> 16:55.070
would you like to whip us up a
couple of the house specials, please?

16:55.480 --> 16:56.630
Why, of course, sir.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.713
Anything to get me off borscht detail.

17:10.880 --> 17:11.869
Mmm.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.435
Mmm.

17:14.359 --> 17:15.794
Such flavor!

17:15.960 --> 17:18.156
Why is this grilled cheese so good?

17:18.440 --> 17:20.159
Sorry, secret ingredient.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.756
It's classified.

17:22.079 --> 17:23.560
You do not know, do you?

17:23.720 --> 17:24.756
Nope.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.036
So what do you do for amusement here?

17:31.680 --> 17:33.478
Well, do you like to bowl?

17:33.800 --> 17:35.234
Not particularly.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.310
Me neither.

17:37.520 --> 17:41.309
There's all kinds of stuff here,
but they're no fun to do alone.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.639
And under 24-hour watch.

17:43.800 --> 17:47.510
And let me guess, many
important "responsibilities."

17:47.680 --> 17:51.469
No kidding. Sometimes,
I feel like I'm just here for photo ops.

17:51.640 --> 17:55.316
At least you do not have to stand for
eight hours at the Victory Day Parade.

17:55.480 --> 17:58.473
Doesn't even compare to
visiting the Iowa State Fair.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.751
They make sculptures out of butter.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.831
- Why?
- I think there isn't much to do there.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.830
I was actually invited
to go to a party downtown tonight.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.198
But I can't go 'cause I have
to entertain our guests.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.357
Well, I hope they're at least nice.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.273
Not so bad so far.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.150
I know how this goes.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.717
You can't go to your party because your
parents are making you go to their party.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.476
It's not fair.
Just 'cause we're the presidents' kids

18:26.640 --> 18:28.597
means we don't get to have any fun?

18:32.200 --> 18:34.510
Sneaking out to party would be fun.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.476
It would, wouldn't it?

18:41.040 --> 18:42.235
But if we got caught...

18:42.400 --> 18:43.390
Siberia?

18:43.600 --> 18:45.193
I was going to say Guantanamo.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.390
Same difference.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.512
But do you always obey your parents?

18:48.680 --> 18:50.831
Me? Not always.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.159
Sometimes.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.119
Okay, pretty much always.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.992
I just thought I was in
"land of the free and

19:02.200 --> 19:03.873
"home of the brave."

19:12.680 --> 19:14.831
Don't worry, Max. We'll be right back.

19:15.920 --> 19:16.831
Let's go, come on.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.630
Tomorrow morning, we'll be
heading to Camp David.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.399
I know how much you love the outdoors

19:21.560 --> 19:24.917
and I thought it would
be a more informal venue for our talks.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.350
We will see.

19:26.760 --> 19:30.800
Of course, the brunt of our time will be
spent discussing the arms treaty,

19:30.960 --> 19:33.794
but we've got all sorts
of great events planned for your visit.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.591
My beautiful wife here
is an esteemed concert pianist.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.719
She's agreed to perform
an evening of Tchaikovsky.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.758
- Pyotr Tchaikovsky?
- Yes.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.752
I love Tchaikovsky.

19:44.920 --> 19:48.436
But everywhere I go,
they play me Tchaikovsky.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.555
I was hoping for Bon Jovi.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.953
Well, I hope the kids
are getting along better than we are.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.350
TJ.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.274
Don't look down, Alex.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.872
I told you it was gonna be easy.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.470
Come on.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.355
I'm allergic to dogs.

20:57.920 --> 20:58.910
Hats.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.313
Okay, ladies first.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.199
You know, we could get
in a lot of trouble here.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.911
My father always says,
"There is no reward without risk."

21:32.680 --> 21:34.034
Mmm. Mmm.

21:38.280 --> 21:39.839
Thomas, Maureen,

21:40.120 --> 21:43.192
I hope you are enjoying the
borscht as much as I am.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.397
Well, I have to say,
this is the best borscht I've ever had.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.676
It's wonderful.

21:54.560 --> 21:58.759
All righty. Now, say hello
to President William Henry Harrison,

21:59.280 --> 22:01.431
who caught pneumonia at his inauguration,

22:01.600 --> 22:05.913
and, fun fact number seven,
died 31 days later.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.116
And we're walking.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.072
Hey, kids. Who wants some hot...

23:25.080 --> 23:26.070
Oh, fudge!

23:34.480 --> 23:36.836
- You think they're looking for us yet?
- Probably,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.559
but it's only a few more blocks.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.515
Look out!

23:42.680 --> 23:44.160
Go, run!

23:44.360 --> 23:45.510
Help!

23:45.760 --> 23:47.353
Help!

24:06.120 --> 24:07.349
TJ! Run!

24:07.520 --> 24:09.557
Come! Come on, Alex!

24:23.480 --> 24:27.713
Mom, you should've seen Max out there.
He was like, like, like a superhero.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.872
We were worried half to death.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.359
Agent Thorn, how is this even possible?

24:33.520 --> 24:34.795
Unfortunately, sir,

24:34.960 --> 24:39.716
due to the restoration, the alarms on the
windows have temporarily been turned off.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.400
I'm really sorry, Dad.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.720
Let's go through this again.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.551
Is there anything you can
remember that might help us?

24:50.720 --> 24:53.554
Okay. I didn't wanna
say anything in front of our guests

24:53.760 --> 24:56.673
but I think I heard one of
those guys say something in Russian.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.913
Max bit one of the guys on the ankle.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.390
Dad, you have to check every one of
those Russians for bite marks.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.752
Son, let's just let the
Secret Service handle this, okay?

25:05.920 --> 25:07.115
You mean the Secret Service

25:07.280 --> 25:09.920
who can't keep track of
two 12-year-old kids?

25:10.080 --> 25:12.390
Okay, I think that you have
caused enough trouble

25:12.560 --> 25:14.438
for one evening, young man. Don't you?

25:14.600 --> 25:16.592
- But, Dad, all I'm...
- No, I don't wanna hear it.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.479
I want you to go to your room, go to bed,

25:18.640 --> 25:21.200
we will discuss your
punishment in the morning.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.591
Fine. Come on, Max.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.514
If he did hear someone speaking Russian,

25:34.760 --> 25:36.433
maybe there are bad
players on the other team.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.792
We can't make unsubstantiated

25:38.960 --> 25:42.431
accusations with the entire
world watching, Agent Thorn.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.597
But, Thomas,
if somebody is looking to hurt...

25:44.760 --> 25:45.796
It's okay, Maureen.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.110
We'll be fine at Camp David.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.957
You mean, we're still going?

25:50.120 --> 25:52.112
- I'm working.
- My agents have been on site

25:52.320 --> 25:54.357
securing the grounds for the past 30 days.

25:54.520 --> 25:58.878
If there is something going on, there is
no safer place for us to be right now.

25:59.800 --> 26:03.953
Yeah, no safer place to be, because you
and I are gonna be there. Right, Max?

26:58.720 --> 26:59.790
Come here, Max.

27:07.720 --> 27:08.710
Sit, Max.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.350
Pick up.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.237
- Good boy.
- Max, come.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.070
Perimeter search.

27:16.520 --> 27:17.556
Go on, boy.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.476
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:30.960 --> 27:31.950
TJ.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.712
What's going on?
Why are you being so weird?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.673
I was thinking we could get together later

27:36.880 --> 27:38.075
and talk more about
what happened last night.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.230
No.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.720
- I can't.
- What?

27:40.880 --> 27:41.870
Why not? What's going on?

27:42.040 --> 27:43.030
I don't know.

27:43.240 --> 27:46.278
Maybe 'cause the only person who knew
I was going to that party was you.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.233
In fact, you pretty much made me go.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.835
TJ, why would I kidnap myself?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.992
How better to make it look
like you're not involved?

27:53.600 --> 27:56.957
Um, just off the top of my head,

27:57.160 --> 27:58.833
maybe not sneaking out with you
in the first place?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.356
That's exactly what
a Russian spy would say.

28:06.760 --> 28:09.992
I'm so glad that you decided to continue

28:10.160 --> 28:11.560
the peace talks, Vladimir.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.757
I'm hoping that
we can jump into it right after lunch.

28:13.960 --> 28:17.158
No, no, no, after lunch, we ride.

28:17.880 --> 28:20.634
We... We ride?

28:21.280 --> 28:25.433
My people, many think best way
to keep Mother Russia strong

28:25.640 --> 28:27.279
is to keep Uncle Sam weak.

28:27.440 --> 28:30.000
But I think strong can work with strong.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.516
So we ride as men.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.111
Then, I know how strong you are.

28:35.800 --> 28:36.790
Okay.

28:37.040 --> 28:40.112
Come, Mr. President!
Let us feel the wind on our faces!

28:40.320 --> 28:41.310
Attaboy!

28:45.160 --> 28:46.799
We ride like men!

28:48.080 --> 28:50.231
Yippie yi yo ki yay!

28:50.680 --> 28:51.796
I'm serious, Coop.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.196
If one of the Russians does
wanna stop the talks,

28:54.360 --> 28:56.192
it'd have to be someone
who came with Bragov.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.999
Someone who's not happy to be here.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.310
Someone like...

29:01.920 --> 29:03.639
Him.

29:05.480 --> 29:07.153
"Authentic fettucine alfredo!"

29:07.320 --> 29:10.870
Even their food is bland and
stolen from other countries!

29:11.160 --> 29:12.514
You sure about this, T?

29:12.680 --> 29:16.196
Think about it. He was also in the kitchen
when Alex and I were sneaking out.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.472
And he sure doesn't seem like
a fan of America. Does he?

29:20.480 --> 29:24.156
Careful with this, T.
You never know where things can lead.

29:24.360 --> 29:27.637
Don't worry, Coop.
A Bennett delivers on his promises.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.919
Max, I think we're finally
barking up the right tree.

30:47.960 --> 30:50.395
Come on, Max.
Let's find out what's in that box.

31:37.080 --> 31:38.514
I wish one of us spoke Russian.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.758
Max, we gotta do something.

32:16.680 --> 32:17.750
Drop the knife!

32:24.160 --> 32:25.879
Are you crazy, little boy?

32:26.640 --> 32:27.710
What are you doing?

32:28.080 --> 32:29.230
What are you doing?

32:29.480 --> 32:32.518
What does it looks like? I'm making famous
homemade Russian rye bread.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.679
- Bread?
- Da.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.719
Finally put stop to dry,
tasteless monstrosity

32:37.880 --> 32:39.758
your buddy, Coop, insists on making.

32:41.880 --> 32:44.634
Now you ruin surprise and dough!

32:45.320 --> 32:46.993
Security hear about this.

32:47.440 --> 32:48.715
And then I tell your mama.

32:48.880 --> 32:51.270
Wait, no. I wasn't here
to ruin the surprise.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.716
I was here because... I... Um...

32:54.080 --> 32:56.595
Because the US President is allergic.

32:56.760 --> 32:57.876
Alex?

32:58.360 --> 32:59.396
- Allergic?
- Yes.

32:59.560 --> 33:02.155
That is why American chef make dry bread.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.549
It's gluten free.

33:05.280 --> 33:09.638
Oh, oh, yeah. My dad gets
real sick if he has any gluten at all.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.559
Didn't you hear in the last campaign?

33:11.760 --> 33:13.592
It was a huge scandal.

33:13.920 --> 33:16.560
The wheat growers association
wouldn't endorse him.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.390
The pizza lobby picketed his events.

33:19.920 --> 33:23.596
I just wanted to stop you
before you got in big trouble.

33:23.760 --> 33:27.436
Yes, you owe this boy
a great debt and apology.

33:27.760 --> 33:28.750
Don't you?

33:32.360 --> 33:33.794
My humble apologies.

33:34.760 --> 33:38.117
Now, come on, TJ. Weren't you going to
give me a tour of the grounds?

33:46.040 --> 33:49.477
What did you think? He had body in box?

33:49.680 --> 33:51.558
I don't know. I...

33:52.440 --> 33:53.954
That was stupid, right?

33:54.120 --> 33:56.954
Not as stupid as thinking
I was behind the attacks.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.919
Sorry about that. I didn't
know who to trust and...

34:00.080 --> 34:01.070
It's okay.

34:01.280 --> 34:04.318
You knew I was innocent. Didn't you, Max?

34:11.960 --> 34:13.952
Uh, how did you know we were out here?

34:14.120 --> 34:17.636
I was doing my own
investigation and saw you doing yours.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.632
You were investigating me?

34:20.520 --> 34:23.797
Someone is looking to hurt
both of our families, TJ.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.871
You think I am not worried, too?

34:26.080 --> 34:28.754
You would have known this if you
actually talked to me this morning

34:28.960 --> 34:30.917
instead of putting me on Most Wanted list.

34:31.080 --> 34:33.594
You're not gonna let me
live that down, are you?

34:33.840 --> 34:35.478
Not until it stops being fun.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.516
So, who do you think is behind it?

34:41.840 --> 34:42.830
Her?

34:43.400 --> 34:46.996
Before trip, I heard Olga say
she thought arms talks with your country

34:47.159 --> 34:48.639
were terrible thing.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.393
Would make my country weak.

34:50.840 --> 34:53.674
In America, everyone is
innocent until proven guilty.

34:54.520 --> 34:57.034
I also saw her applying
antibiotic ointment

34:57.280 --> 35:00.591
to her ankle this morning
like she has fresh wound.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.793
Hope she looks good in orange.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.914
Stop staring at her.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.799
Well, if I'm not staring at her,

35:18.960 --> 35:21.031
how am I supposed
to know she's doing anything suspicious?

35:22.680 --> 35:25.195
Would anyone like to sample
today's blue plate special?

35:25.360 --> 35:29.195
- Thanks, Coop.
- She's cute, T.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.433
Honey, do you want me
to get you some more ice?

35:35.600 --> 35:37.557
A glacier wouldn't help.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.760
Oh. Morning, Vladimir.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.035
How was your sleep?

35:44.600 --> 35:47.718
The sleep of 1,000 men. You?

35:47.880 --> 35:50.952
Who wouldn't feel great after
a four-hour ride on Diablo?

35:51.320 --> 35:55.075
Good, then, well rested.
We go white water rafting today.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.311
White water rafting.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.439
You know, I was hoping that we could just
jump right into our talks.

36:00.600 --> 36:04.389
No, today we ride the rapids.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.154
Like men!

36:06.920 --> 36:09.230
Maybe I'm not hating
him as much as I thought.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.196
Seems we're having more
in common all the time.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.033
- I'll send for your chiropractor.
- Thank you.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.190
Yeah.

36:22.640 --> 36:23.676
Morning, kids.

36:23.840 --> 36:24.830
- Hey, Dad.
- Morning.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.999
Come on, let's follow her.

37:25.800 --> 37:29.157
TJ. Maybe we should tell
somebody about this.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.915
We will, as soon as
we've got proof. Come on.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.190
Wait.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.320
Are you scared?

37:37.560 --> 37:38.596
Aren't you?

37:38.880 --> 37:40.360
Why should I be scared?

37:41.360 --> 37:42.396
We've got Max.

38:41.720 --> 38:42.949
What do you think she's doing?

38:43.120 --> 38:45.555
I don't think she's
listening to Katy Perry.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.958
I do not think we can get close
enough to see her ankle from here.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.194
Maybe Max can.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.877
We'll be able to see everything Max sees.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.957
TJ, you're much cleverer than
your file had indicated.

39:20.120 --> 39:23.477
Max. Go, go.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.111
Olga!

39:49.720 --> 39:50.949
What about Max?

40:05.400 --> 40:06.470
What are they saying?

40:07.000 --> 40:09.151
They're spying on my
father's First Secretary.

40:09.320 --> 40:10.310
Why?

40:10.800 --> 40:13.076
My father always says trust is weakness.

40:27.560 --> 40:28.596
That's no bite mark,

40:28.760 --> 40:30.160
she just got a tattoo.

40:30.360 --> 40:31.680
Of a unicorn?

40:55.720 --> 40:59.191
I am very disappointed in you, TJ.

40:59.680 --> 41:00.875
As am I, Alex.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.677
Maybe you are
not my precious little angel after all.

41:07.040 --> 41:11.512
If you cannot control your son,
I will control my daughter.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.920
Okay. Bragov, it takes two to tango.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.720
That is true, but I must do this.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.514
Hand it over, Alex.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.430
Hand what over?

41:24.680 --> 41:27.718
What you got from your
mamochka for Christmas.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.355
There will be no more of this foolishness,

41:36.520 --> 41:39.957
and you are not
to be around this boy without supervision.

41:40.120 --> 41:41.634
- But, Father, I...
- No.

41:42.280 --> 41:43.919
I was wrong to bring you on this trip.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.833
I thought it would be good for you.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.596
But now, I can see it has
been quite the opposite.

42:03.240 --> 42:05.391
Uh, Vladimir, are we still going rafting

42:05.560 --> 42:08.029
or would you like to just
jump into negotiations?

42:10.760 --> 42:11.750
Okay.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.153
This is... This is great.

42:15.400 --> 42:18.711
I thought we agreed that you
would stop spying on people.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.439
But they're spying on people, too.

42:20.640 --> 42:22.313
That is their job!

42:22.880 --> 42:25.270
My job is to protect you.

42:25.480 --> 42:27.278
- Mr. President...
- Agent Thorn, please.

42:27.680 --> 42:29.399
With all due respect, sir.

42:29.600 --> 42:33.355
I think perhaps we should consider
bringing in another tactical canine

42:33.520 --> 42:34.795
to replace Max.

42:34.960 --> 42:37.759
He's clearly been confused
by his time with your son.

42:40.680 --> 42:41.955
Agent Thorn,

42:43.360 --> 42:46.159
that is your way of saying
"I told you so"?

42:46.800 --> 42:47.790
Very subtle.

42:49.240 --> 42:50.674
Sir.

42:52.400 --> 42:55.040
TJ,

42:55.320 --> 42:57.471
I think it's time that maybe we made

42:57.640 --> 43:01.793
- a change with Max.
- No, Dad. It's not Max's fault, it's mine.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.595
Yes, TJ, that may be
true but I have some...

43:04.760 --> 43:06.558
You can't take away my only friend.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.070
Please, Dad.

43:12.280 --> 43:13.839
He makes me feel safe.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.150
Let me still hang with him.

43:16.200 --> 43:18.840
I'll drop it, for real this time.
I promise.

43:23.840 --> 43:24.830
Okay.

43:25.720 --> 43:26.836
Fine.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.832
But I want you to stay
out of trouble, okay?

43:30.040 --> 43:31.235
Both of you.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.030
Deal?

43:33.400 --> 43:34.390
Yes.

43:34.560 --> 43:35.550
Okay.

44:09.760 --> 44:10.750
You done, pal?

44:10.960 --> 44:12.758
I'm finished, all right.

44:13.320 --> 44:14.720
Don't let it get you down, T.

44:14.920 --> 44:16.957
Your dad will let up,
once negotiations are over.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.520
Maybe, by then...

44:18.680 --> 44:20.194
That cute one will be gone?

44:21.280 --> 44:22.350
Yeah.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.913
At least you still got me, right?

44:29.080 --> 44:30.275
TJ, you ready to go?

44:30.480 --> 44:31.834
Go? Go where?

44:50.640 --> 44:51.790
You're more strong. Come on!

44:52.000 --> 44:53.673
Give back my shoe. Max.

44:53.920 --> 44:54.956
- Come on, Max!
- Max!

44:55.120 --> 44:56.759
Come.

44:59.080 --> 45:00.116
Go on, Max.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.270
Do your job.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.632
How about over here?
Who'd like some water?

45:14.800 --> 45:16.393
Here you go, darling.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.079
- Good, yeah.
- Lovely.

45:30.520 --> 45:32.716
I will be coxswain.

45:33.120 --> 45:35.680
Co-coxswains.

45:38.480 --> 45:40.119
- TJ, come on!
- Alexandra.

45:41.840 --> 45:42.910
Positions, everyone.

45:43.080 --> 45:44.400
Eagle's about to take a dip.

45:44.760 --> 45:45.750
Ugh!

46:02.440 --> 46:03.590
Come on, paddle!

46:03.760 --> 46:04.955
Quickly!

46:08.160 --> 46:09.992
- Whoo!
- Attaway!

46:11.240 --> 46:12.515
Attaboy, TJ!

46:12.880 --> 46:14.234
Good job, guys!

46:18.120 --> 46:19.110
Look out!

46:19.520 --> 46:20.510
Back paddle!

46:20.680 --> 46:22.000
Back paddle!

46:22.720 --> 46:23.915
Back!

46:33.480 --> 46:34.675
Paddle!

46:41.720 --> 46:43.712
Whoo! We did it!

46:46.320 --> 46:48.710
Everybody, high-five!

46:59.240 --> 47:02.712
Looks like our countries can work
together when we need to, eh?

47:02.920 --> 47:03.910
Da.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.560
I believe in peace.

47:05.920 --> 47:09.154
But there are those in my country
who think peace is weak.

47:09.840 --> 47:13.949
They think any talks whatsoever
with your country amounts to treason.

47:15.920 --> 47:17.070
What do you think?

47:18.240 --> 47:20.072
I think...

47:21.520 --> 47:22.920
Here we go again!

47:24.760 --> 47:25.989
Well done, Alexandra!

47:26.760 --> 47:28.592
Stay in the middle! Stay in the middle!

47:30.120 --> 47:31.236
Hang on, Alexandra!

47:31.400 --> 47:32.436
Paddle!

47:34.160 --> 47:35.753
To the right!

47:36.880 --> 47:38.633
Paddle!

47:42.560 --> 47:43.960
Paddle, Alexandra.

47:44.120 --> 47:45.634
Harder, TJ!

48:00.280 --> 48:01.919
- Alexandra!
- TJ!

48:13.640 --> 48:14.835
Dad, help!

48:16.480 --> 48:18.312
- Alexandra!
- Help!

48:18.480 --> 48:19.994
All agents, move in now!

48:20.680 --> 48:21.670
Dad!

48:21.880 --> 48:23.155
TJ!

48:23.360 --> 48:24.589
I'm coming!

48:24.760 --> 48:25.830
Alex!

48:26.360 --> 48:27.430
No!

48:27.880 --> 48:29.280
No! Alex!

48:29.440 --> 48:30.510
Save Alexandra!

48:30.720 --> 48:31.710
Help!

48:34.240 --> 48:35.356
- Dad!
- TJ!

48:36.520 --> 48:37.556
TJ!

48:38.680 --> 48:40.160
Papa! Help!

48:40.320 --> 48:41.515
Alexandra!

48:42.680 --> 48:43.796
Papa!

48:44.520 --> 48:45.510
Dad!

48:46.040 --> 48:47.030
Hold on!

48:47.200 --> 48:48.190
Dad!

48:49.160 --> 48:50.150
Dad!

48:50.960 --> 48:52.838
Okay, I got you! I got you, you're okay.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.719
I got you! Come on!

48:57.800 --> 48:58.870
Help!

49:04.160 --> 49:05.753
- Help!
- Alexandra!

49:06.720 --> 49:07.710
Help!

49:07.960 --> 49:08.950
Papa!

49:13.840 --> 49:14.830
Help!

49:32.440 --> 49:33.510
Help!

49:35.560 --> 49:36.550
Papa!

49:43.160 --> 49:44.480
Max!

49:45.560 --> 49:46.596
Max!

49:46.840 --> 49:47.876
Max!

49:48.320 --> 49:49.390
Oh!

50:05.560 --> 50:06.596
Oh.

50:06.760 --> 50:08.080
Thank you, Max!

50:08.400 --> 50:10.437
Yeah. Thank you, boy.

50:13.600 --> 50:15.080
Alexandra.

50:15.280 --> 50:16.350
Alexandra.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.758
- Alexandra.
- Papa...

50:18.920 --> 50:20.479
- Alexandra.
- I'm okay.

50:20.640 --> 50:21.630
I'm okay.

50:27.240 --> 50:28.356
Enough!

50:28.960 --> 50:31.077
My daughter was almost killed.

50:31.240 --> 50:34.631
I do not want to hear any more
of your sincere apologies.

50:34.840 --> 50:37.719
We inspected the raft
fully before embarking.

50:37.880 --> 50:40.190
It must've gotten caught on
a sharp rock or some flotsam...

50:40.360 --> 50:42.636
Or someone tried to sink it on purpose.

50:42.800 --> 50:44.314
TJ, on purpose?

50:44.520 --> 50:45.636
We went over this.

50:46.080 --> 50:47.958
Dad, did you feel us hit anything?

50:48.280 --> 50:49.509
Because I know I didn't.

50:49.680 --> 50:52.240
And do you really think it's a coincidence
that we were all attacked...

50:52.480 --> 50:53.596
Okay, TJ, enough!

50:54.480 --> 50:56.836
You heard Agent Thorn, it was an accident.

50:57.280 --> 50:58.270
- But I just...
- Don't!

50:58.480 --> 51:00.517
I don't wanna hear another word. Drop it.

51:16.400 --> 51:17.959
Go on, Max, give it to Alex.

51:54.840 --> 51:55.876
TJ?

51:56.480 --> 51:57.470
TJ?

51:57.680 --> 51:58.750
Over here!

51:58.920 --> 52:00.354
Don't scare me like that.

52:01.920 --> 52:02.910
Sorry.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.316
Did anyone follow you?

52:04.600 --> 52:05.590
Just you.

52:05.800 --> 52:07.280
Payback for when you followed me.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.555
I think I know who's trying
to stop the talks.

52:12.720 --> 52:13.756
Agent Thorn.

52:13.920 --> 52:15.149
That's a relief.

52:15.360 --> 52:18.558
I thought you were going to say
something crazy, like Agent Thorn.

52:18.800 --> 52:19.790
I'm serious.

52:20.560 --> 52:21.550
Think about it.

52:21.720 --> 52:23.791
Where was he when we all
went overboard today?

52:23.960 --> 52:25.872
And it was his job to check the raft.

52:26.240 --> 52:29.876
And it was his job to follow up
on all leads for both attacks.

52:30.080 --> 52:33.118
Exactly. And all that stuff about Max
not spending time with me?

52:33.280 --> 52:34.953
He probably knew he'd sniff him out.

52:35.120 --> 52:38.477
He also could've intentionally
let us sneak out to go to that party

52:38.640 --> 52:39.960
so you'd get attacked.

52:40.120 --> 52:42.191
I knew it, an American is behind this.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.875
Wait. Who said he was American?

52:45.040 --> 52:47.271
He could really be a Russian in disguise.

52:47.440 --> 52:48.430
A double agent.

52:48.640 --> 52:49.756
Remember the accent we heard that night?

52:49.920 --> 52:53.436
He was probably faking that accent
to make it seem like he was Russian.

52:53.600 --> 52:55.398
An American posing as a Russian.

52:55.560 --> 52:56.789
A triple agent.

52:58.760 --> 53:00.592
Or he's a quadruple agent.

53:01.160 --> 53:03.914
Really a Russian,
faking the accent of an American,

53:04.080 --> 53:06.914
doing a Russian accent
so we'd think he was American...

53:07.840 --> 53:10.480
Okay. Maybe we should
stop at double agent.

53:10.640 --> 53:12.120
Russian or American.

53:12.680 --> 53:13.750
I can live with that.

53:15.120 --> 53:16.270
So, wait.

53:16.600 --> 53:20.230
Are we really accusing the head
of your presidential security...

53:20.400 --> 53:23.393
Of what is basically treason
with almost no proof?

53:23.720 --> 53:24.710
My dad will think I'm crazy.

53:24.880 --> 53:28.191
And as much as my papa would like to
embarrass your country,

53:28.400 --> 53:29.914
I think he would, too.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.875
So, we set up a trap to
expose him to our fathers.

53:34.040 --> 53:35.440
Saving the arms talks.

53:35.600 --> 53:37.034
And the world!

53:40.400 --> 53:41.390
Yeah.

53:41.640 --> 53:42.630
Yeah.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.756
But how the heck are we gonna do that?

53:52.400 --> 53:53.470
I think I know.

53:56.760 --> 53:58.479
All right. Take it up, man.

53:59.320 --> 54:01.391
Up. Yes, that up. Good.

54:03.680 --> 54:04.750
There we go.

54:04.920 --> 54:06.957
Yeah... That's good.

54:07.120 --> 54:08.156
Now, tie that off.

54:08.360 --> 54:09.999
Make sure you tie it off really good.

54:12.320 --> 54:13.640
My tummy hurts.

54:18.760 --> 54:19.830
Well...

54:20.520 --> 54:21.920
You do feel a bit warm.

54:22.120 --> 54:23.110
Yeah.

54:23.360 --> 54:24.476
I think it was the borscht.

54:24.640 --> 54:28.350
It's, uh, really rushin' through me.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.037
Well, I'm sure your mom will understand.

54:34.120 --> 54:37.318
Max, make sure he drinks
plenty of liquids, okay?

54:38.040 --> 54:39.394
All right, get some rest.

54:52.600 --> 54:53.954
Alex, Alex.

54:54.120 --> 54:55.190
Over. Alex!

54:55.400 --> 54:57.835
I do not understand.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.276
Why can you not tell me
what is wrong with you?

55:01.040 --> 55:02.872
Well... Uh...

55:03.120 --> 55:06.238
If Mama was here, I could tell her.

55:08.520 --> 55:09.510
Oh.

55:09.680 --> 55:10.670
I see.

55:11.240 --> 55:12.230
Well...

55:12.440 --> 55:15.035
Feel better, or rest up.

55:16.240 --> 55:17.754
Thank you, Papa. I will.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.319
Alex, Alex, over.

55:25.480 --> 55:26.994
TJ, what are you doing?

55:27.240 --> 55:29.118
I said I would call you when I was ready.

55:29.280 --> 55:32.034
- My papa almost found out I had this.
- Sorry.

55:32.200 --> 55:33.190
You good for tonight?

55:33.400 --> 55:34.595
Do not worry.

55:34.760 --> 55:36.274
My papa will not
check on me again tonight.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.319
Or probably ever again.

55:39.080 --> 55:42.039
Good, then Operation
"Catch-a-Quintuple-Agent" is a go.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.712
You couldn't leave it alone, could you?

55:45.000 --> 55:45.990
Nope.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.118
Thank you for coming, Bragov.

55:54.280 --> 55:55.634
It's my pleasure, Mr. President.

55:55.800 --> 55:59.953
I am afraid Alexandra
will not be joining us this evening.

56:00.120 --> 56:02.589
She's not feeling well.

56:03.600 --> 56:05.239
Your son is not coming, either?

56:05.760 --> 56:06.796
Uh...

56:06.960 --> 56:07.950
No.

56:08.160 --> 56:09.753
Also not feeling well.

56:10.960 --> 56:12.713
Maybe they have the same ailment.

56:13.120 --> 56:14.634
I do not think so.

56:26.720 --> 56:29.952
I've always believed
that music was a universal language.

56:30.480 --> 56:32.312
A language that we all speak.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.000
A language of humility,

56:34.560 --> 56:35.630
love,

56:35.800 --> 56:38.395
and, most importantly, peace.

57:07.200 --> 57:08.919
Okay, remember the plan.

57:09.120 --> 57:10.839
When Max lures Thorn,
you pretend to faint,

57:11.000 --> 57:13.071
- and when he bends down, I snap.
- I know.

57:13.280 --> 57:14.794
It's my plan. Remember?

57:15.040 --> 57:17.236
Your plan? But I'm the one who...

57:18.400 --> 57:19.595
Forget it.

57:21.120 --> 57:22.440
Go, Max, fetch Thorn.

57:25.960 --> 57:27.519
Quick!

57:35.680 --> 57:37.114
All clear, backstage.

57:43.360 --> 57:45.192
Was this part of your plan, too?

57:46.200 --> 57:47.634
I don't know.

57:47.800 --> 57:51.157
- Um...
- It's okay. It's good part.

57:58.640 --> 58:01.633
You're right.
Her Tchaikovsky's not half-bad.

58:02.680 --> 58:04.399
Well, half-thank you.

58:12.600 --> 58:14.717
Max, what are you doing here?

58:17.760 --> 58:18.750
Shh!

58:20.680 --> 58:22.034
Leaving my post.

58:23.640 --> 58:26.075
Well, no security detail.

58:26.760 --> 58:27.750
We're alone.

58:29.120 --> 58:31.032
Yeah? And how does it feel?

58:31.760 --> 58:32.955
Very

58:33.600 --> 58:34.590
secure.

58:35.760 --> 58:36.750
I feel same,

58:37.760 --> 58:40.912
also, hot and worried about
running out of air.

58:41.560 --> 58:43.916
But secure, that, too.

58:54.960 --> 58:56.235
Make that very worried.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.510
Mom, look out!

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.390
Maureen!

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.673
It doesn't matter that we tricked you.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.674
If we weren't here,
Mom could've been hurt or worse!

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.040
I don't understand.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.874
Who could've done something like this?

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.270
Him!

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.716
Excuse me?

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.910
Look at his ankle, Dad.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.396
He'll have the bite marks
from the day Max saved me.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.319
Agent Thorn, I'm...

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.070
I'm sorry, this is really awkward.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.232
It's no problem at all, sir.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.033
But, no, it's not possible.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.190
TJ.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.476
Alexandra,

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.959
it is time for us to go.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.190
Go where?

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.113
To the safest place on Earth,

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.316
Moscow.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.473
Go. Go!

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.199
Vladimir, you're leaving?

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.873
Do we, at least, have a deal
on the drawdown?

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.150
As I said,

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.190
if you cannot protect our children,

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.230
how can you protect our children?

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.710
Come, Alexandra.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:04.910
I'm sorry, TJ.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.350
Vladimir!

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.960
Well.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.470
Great.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.834
Well, it seems who was ever trying
to sabotage the meetings

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.480
has finally succeeded.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.994
Mr. President, our new security canine
has clearly been corrupted

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.278
by his relationship with your son,
as I feared.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.632
Permission to terminate his service here.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.357
What? No, Dad, you can't do that!

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.076
TJ, you've brought this upon yourself.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.516
Thomas!

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.990
Agent Thorn,

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.275
permission granted.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.034
- Thank you, sir.
- Dad!

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.429
- Please, no.
- Max.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.519
- Mom.
- I'm sorry.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.590
Let's go, Max.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.154
- Come on.
- Dad, please.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.151
Let's go. Max.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.473
Come on. Come on.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.950
Come on.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.680
Max! Come!

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.752
Come on. Come on.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.872
Let's go, Max. Come on.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.520
Max, wait. Don't go!

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.111
I'm really gonna miss you. Max.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.478
I'm really gonna miss you, boy.
I'm really gonna miss you.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.115
Let's go, Max.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.760
Come on, come on.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.675
Let's go, Max.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.150
In.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.790
Hey.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.230
You're up early.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.710
Couldn't sleep.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.310
Ah.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.476
I know you're bummed the Rooskies
are leaving early.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.556
But I gotta tell ya, that Russian chef,

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.440
bigger dictator than Bragov.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.595
Nice try, Coop.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.632
You can't beat yourself up about this, T.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.598
You followed your gut, you saved your mom.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.592
But now, I'll never know
who was really behind it,

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.274
and that's not even the worst part.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.791
My dad can barely even look at me.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.474
I'll never see Alex again,

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.352
and who knows what they'll do to Max,
now that he's been "corrupted."

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.595
Look at it this way, T.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.991
At least you got the first chapter
of your memoirs figured out.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.520
As usual, Coop, you're the only one
around here who makes me feel any better.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.750
Oh!

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.149
Oh. Hey.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.595
Let me help you with that.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.956
Uh,

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.032
I guess I better start packin'.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.350
Oh, yeah?

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.679
Are you sure you don't want a smoothie?

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.990
Nah, I'm cool.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.474
No worries, see you back at WH.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.233
Uh, yeah, the White House.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.350
T,

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.793
you know I can't let you leave,

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.589
not after what you just saw.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.872
What do you mean? I didn't see anything.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:51.875
Nice try, kiddo.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.479
Coop, what are you doin'?

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.915
Oh, yeah.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.271
My name's not really Coop, T.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:02.559
That's just a good friendly
American name, no?

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.960
What? You're Russian?
You've been behind all this?

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.438
- Why?
- Why?

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.000
Because peace is weak.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:13.278
The people I work with will not allow
my country to surrender its weapons,

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.716
not for your country, not for anyone.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:20.395
I will keep Mother Russia strong,
not men like Bragov.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.159
So, now,

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.519
I'm going to give you a choice.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.955
You can keep trying
to play the hero, or...

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.720
You have made your choice.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.350
Oh!

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:43.032
This time, you'll not get out so easy.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.115
Let me out!

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.430
Da?

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.432
Time for insurance policy, Olga.

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.114
Yeah, privy to Alexandra.

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.118
Olga.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.636
I'm really sorry it had to come to this.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.200
I really enjoyed our talks
over these months.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.509
And,

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.230
FYI,

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.432
the secret to a great grilled cheese

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.798
is to add just a touch
of Russian dressing.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.629
Help! Help!

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.917
Can anyone hear me? Help!

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.430
Help!

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.350
Sweetheart, wake up.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.239
Your papa, he wants to see you now.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.790
- What? My papa?
- Yeah.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.992
Put on your slippers.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.635
Let's go.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.510
That's it.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:58.996
Help!

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.637
Come on, Alexandra.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:13.836
Careful, now.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.160
Wait, Olga.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.670
What is my father doing out here?

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:23.198
No more question.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.996
Help!

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:06.471
Get the dog!

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.756
Block him off!

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:14.118
What is going...

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:15.555
Max? Come here!

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.310
- Where is it?
- Close in!

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.318
Max! Max!

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.395
But you're security,
you can't even stop a dog!

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:27.350
TJ?

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:29.395
Max!

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:32.756
TJ! Thorn!

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:36.879
- TJ, come here.
- Oh, my God.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.520
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.194
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.000
Max! Max!

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.350
You saved me again, boy.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.715
You saved me again.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.957
Alex, she's in terrible danger.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.116
Alexandra.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.193
The Hawk's on its way, sir.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.631
We'll have eyes in the sky
in less than 10 minutes.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.480
They can't have gone far, so, I set up...

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.513
They'll never find her at this rate.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.279
Depending on which direction they've gone,

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.557
we'll have to split up our resources.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.632
Come here, Max.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.632
Seek, Max, seek. Seek, Max, seek.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.596
Everybody!

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.479
If you wanna find her, follow Max.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.552
All right, men, move out. Go, go, go!

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.390
There's Max!

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:48.910
No!

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.156
Stop!

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.355
Argh!

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.995
Stay with him, Thorn.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.879
Don't!

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.357
Tsk, tsk. It's not safe
for you to be in woods alone.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.671
Help!

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.636
Pull up, pull up! Stop!

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.031
- Look what Max found.
- That is Alex's.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.720
TJ, get in, come on!

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:01.274
Wait till my father
gets his hands on you two!

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.912
Rotten door.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:10.076
Told you not to get an American car.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.833
Go, go, go! Come on!

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.673
Max, find her, please!

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.549
All units! We need to cut off
all access routes north of the river.

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.555
Shut her up!

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.318
Naughty little girl.

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.516
Naughty!

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.710
Naughty!

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:57.870
- I got her!
- No!

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.509
- I got you!
- Stop, stop!

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.510
I hate that dog!

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.629
Argh!

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.030
Argh!

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.196
Get him, Max!

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.354
Stupid dog!

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.550
Out of the vehicle!

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:32.275
Get him off me! Get this animal off me!

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.553
Take her away.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:49.195
We would've gotten away with it, too, if it
wasn't for these meddling kids and the dog!

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.269
Hey, Coop.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.272
I know everyone in maximum security's
gonna love your grilled cheese!

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.955
Listen, TJ,

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.594
I am so sorry that I didn't listen to you.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.560
- It's okay, Dad.
- No, it's not okay.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:17.551
We may be the First Family,
but we are a family first.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:23.400
I know how difficult this must've been
for you to be ripped out of your old life.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.360
I promise you,

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.114
I am going to do everything I can
to make your new one a little easier.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.390
Oh...

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.310
I love you.

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.199
Alex, I am flying in

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.478
my personal physician
to make sure you are all right.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.592
Papa, that is not necessary.

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.400
But there is something
that you can do for me.

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.633
Just say the word, my precious angel.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.236
I'm pleased to announce
that we've come to terms

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.711
on a historic nuclear arms treaty.

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:16.036
One that will keep
both our countries strong.

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.869
And one more thing.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.872
We wouldn't be here today

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.078
if it weren't for someone very special.

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:40.830
Now, this may be a little bit unorthodox
but also incredibly deserved.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.272
I am pleased to present

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:49.516
the very first ever K-9 Medal of Honor
to an amazing dog named Max!

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.669
You really have to leave tonight?

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.878
Why, do you want to accuse me of
another conspiracy before I go?

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.113
You're not gonna let me
live that down, are you?

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.710
Like I said, not until it stops being fun.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.757
I was right about one thing, though.

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:24.950
What is that?

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:26.873
A Russian was behind it.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:30.632
But he was undercover as
American in White House.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.469
So, we call it even?

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.390
I'll take it.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.999
What was that?

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.196
Excuse me.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.754
Sorry to interrupt.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.390
But I'm afraid

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.995
Max's time with us has come to an end.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.594
I'm really gonna miss you, Max.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.790
We all are.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.072
I know you're gonna miss me too, boy.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.470
Go on.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.034
He sure is some dog, huh?

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.110
Yeah...

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.275
It's not gonna be the same
around here without him.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:02.830
TJ?

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.396
Why don't you come with us?

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.200
I think we may have something
that'll cheer you up.

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.396
Come on.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.991
These are Charlie's puppies.

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.389
Take your pick.

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.309
I want them all.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.790
Hi, guys.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.992
Who wants to play with TJ?

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.837
Come on! Come on, guys.

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:37.116
You got my ear.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.229
So ticklish!
