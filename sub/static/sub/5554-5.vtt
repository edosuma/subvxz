WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.134
"Don't worry, Whimsical Boy.

00:03.136 --> 00:04.502
"Dr. Power Pants
has been banished

00:04.504 --> 00:06.437
"to the Intergalactic
Slacks Rack,

00:06.439 --> 00:09.773
where he will be sent
to Suspenders Animation."

00:09.775 --> 00:11.207
Get it?

00:11.209 --> 00:12.208
Instead of suspended animation,

00:12.210 --> 00:13.242
<i> suspenders</i> animation.

00:13.244 --> 00:16.044
Very clever.

00:17.514 --> 00:19.413
You seem tired.

00:19.415 --> 00:21.615
Maybe we should save
the rest for Wednesday.

00:21.617 --> 00:23.516
Yeah, I would love to.

00:23.518 --> 00:26.452
Um, but I...

00:26.454 --> 00:28.520
have a procedure scheduled.

00:28.522 --> 00:30.621
What kind of procedure?

00:33.559 --> 00:37.093
Deep brain stimulation.

00:37.095 --> 00:38.527
My tremors
have gotten worse,

00:38.529 --> 00:40.162
so they're gonna
put this--

00:40.163 --> 00:41.796
The tip of an electrode into
the thalamus of your brain

00:41.798 --> 00:44.532
and then connect that
to a pacemaker.

00:44.534 --> 00:46.166
They're hopeful
it gives me a better

00:46.168 --> 00:47.367
quality of life
these last few months.

00:47.369 --> 00:50.103
Don't say that.

00:50.105 --> 00:52.438
I thought geniuses like facts.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.440
Not that one.

00:54.442 --> 00:56.608
I'm nervous.

00:56.610 --> 00:59.577
If they're off
by a fraction of an inch,

00:59.579 --> 01:01.312
I could lose my vision,

01:01.314 --> 01:04.048
my ability to speak.

01:04.050 --> 01:05.716
Can you be there

01:05.718 --> 01:08.118
when I come out of it?

01:08.120 --> 01:11.087
I know it's silly,
but if I open my eyes

01:11.089 --> 01:13.089
and I see you,

01:13.091 --> 01:16.459
I'll be reassured.

01:16.461 --> 01:19.795
I will absolutely be there.

01:19.797 --> 01:22.464
It'll take a few days

01:22.466 --> 01:25.500
for the doctors to know
if the procedure's a success,

01:25.502 --> 01:29.070
so, please, don't tell anyone...

01:29.072 --> 01:32.239
especially not Walter.

01:34.476 --> 01:36.075
CABE:
<i> All right, jab-- one, two!</i>

01:36.077 --> 01:37.276
(punches land)

01:37.278 --> 01:39.278
One, three!

01:39.280 --> 01:42.347
All right, can't wait
for Toby to get here...

01:42.349 --> 01:44.349
so he can watch
his twin sister box.

01:44.351 --> 01:45.650
One, three, six!

01:45.652 --> 01:48.085
(grunting)

01:48.087 --> 01:49.252
Aah!

01:49.254 --> 01:50.753
(whoops)

01:50.755 --> 01:52.621
I told you to throw an uppercut,

01:52.623 --> 01:54.490
and you threw a hook.

01:54.491 --> 01:56.358
Correction-- I threw a hook
right through concrete.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.827
Cabe, I think I'm ready
for a smoker.

01:58.829 --> 02:00.728
Some church-basement,
amateur-hour slug fest?

02:00.730 --> 02:02.129
Let me get in the ring.

02:02.131 --> 02:04.097
You know these pillars
fight back in a smoker.

02:04.099 --> 02:06.666
HAPPY:
Don't get too excited.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.501
That wall's water-damaged.

02:12.105 --> 02:13.137
Seriously?

02:13.139 --> 02:15.139
SYLVESTER:
Not just the walls.

02:15.141 --> 02:18.175
The pipe above my desk has been
dripping onto my workspace.

02:18.177 --> 02:19.409
This is absurd.

02:19.411 --> 02:21.344
If the collective IQ
of NASA scientists

02:21.346 --> 02:23.312
had a baby with the brains
of M.I.T. researchers,

02:23.314 --> 02:25.213
they'd give birth to us.

02:25.215 --> 02:26.681
Yet somehow,
we work in a dingy garage

02:26.683 --> 02:28.849
that is falling apart
at the seams.

02:28.851 --> 02:30.150
It's a sham!

02:30.152 --> 02:31.217
Or a mockery.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.551
BOTH:
A shmockery.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.386
Sounds like
this place is in need

02:34.388 --> 02:37.222
of some serious
Ray-novations.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.122
He's still here?

02:38.124 --> 02:39.289
RAY:
Luckily for you.

02:39.291 --> 02:40.857
I'm gonna fix this place up.

02:40.859 --> 02:42.525
The least I can do
for letting me live here.

02:42.527 --> 02:44.326
Yeah, I think
I missed that vote.

02:44.328 --> 02:47.696
Well, I'm off
for my morning constitutional.

02:47.698 --> 02:49.230
Morning.

02:49.232 --> 02:50.564
What's up?

02:50.566 --> 02:51.865
We want to get out of this dump.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.399
Well, that's not happening.

02:53.401 --> 02:55.267
All my funds
have gone into my rocket

02:55.269 --> 02:56.801
and Megan's research.

02:56.803 --> 02:59.503
Hit up your billionaire pal Elia
for some cash.

02:59.505 --> 03:00.737
That's inappropriate.

03:00.739 --> 03:02.371
Okay, I have an idea.

03:02.373 --> 03:05.140
Why don't you
guys kick in?

03:05.142 --> 03:07.909
I'll give up equity in the
company for an influx of cash.

03:07.911 --> 03:10.578
I just bought a '43 Harley
Knucklehead that's roached.

03:10.580 --> 03:13.581
I am what you would
call cash-poor.

03:13.583 --> 03:15.282
All my money is tied
up in comic books.

03:15.284 --> 03:18.785
Two words--
race and track.

03:18.787 --> 03:20.553
Wow.

03:20.555 --> 03:23.455
Sounds like you guys
could use an influx of cash.

03:24.524 --> 03:26.257
Who's ready to work?

03:26.259 --> 03:28.158
Organized crime members in
Kazakhstan have obtained

03:28.160 --> 03:31.427
a Soviet 1970s-era nuke.

03:31.429 --> 03:33.495
They are preparing
to sell it tomorrow night

03:33.497 --> 03:34.696
to the highest bidder.

03:34.698 --> 03:36.164
Starting price-- 20 million.

03:36.166 --> 03:39.167
And none of the potential buyers
are our friends.

03:39.169 --> 03:40.735
Intel tracked
the missile

03:40.737 --> 03:43.370
to an abandoned Soviet
naval base on the Ishim River,

03:43.372 --> 03:47.307
containing 47 warehouses
on 100 hectares.

03:47.309 --> 03:50.710
It's deserted, except for
the occasional security patrol,

03:50.712 --> 03:53.713
but those guys are unarmed
private contractors.

03:53.715 --> 03:56.582
We have no idea where
the missile is on this base.

03:56.584 --> 04:00.319
So, you want the guys in the
flea-infested garage to find it.

04:00.321 --> 04:03.322
That's fine.
Our fee is $5 billion.

04:03.324 --> 04:05.390
Zip it.
Katherine?

04:05.392 --> 04:07.792
Well, if Scorpion
can use their tech skills

04:07.794 --> 04:10.394
to locate the building the
warhead is being stored in,

04:10.396 --> 04:12.329
we can then send in a SEAL team

04:12.331 --> 04:13.730
from neighboring
Kyrgyzstan

04:13.732 --> 04:15.865
to take down these
sellers and disarm

04:15.867 --> 04:17.600
and confiscate this weaponry.

04:17.602 --> 04:18.734
Soviet-era buildings were
constructed

04:18.736 --> 04:21.770
with lead and concrete,

04:21.772 --> 04:23.271
so a Geiger counter
or thermography

04:23.273 --> 04:25.340
won't help us find it.

04:25.341 --> 04:27.408
WALTER: Yeah, you said the,
uh, missile is from the '70s,

04:27.410 --> 04:30.310
so we're probably dealing
with an R-400 Elbrus?

04:30.312 --> 04:31.377
Very good.

04:31.379 --> 04:33.912
Yeah, well,
I own a Russian rocket.

04:33.914 --> 04:36.681
Anyway, the Elbrus
releases an electrical hum

04:36.683 --> 04:38.249
in the 40 kilohertz range.

04:38.251 --> 04:39.550
Humans can't hear it.

04:39.552 --> 04:41.235
Dogs can't hear it.

04:41.236 --> 04:42.919
But I could rig a sensor,
like a tricked-out microphone

04:42.922 --> 04:44.821
that could pick it up.

04:44.823 --> 04:46.422
Won't get the exact building,
but we can narrow it down

04:46.424 --> 04:47.856
to two or three. WALTER:
Yeah, and then we can

04:47.858 --> 04:49.891
narrow it down from there,
so logic dictates

04:49.893 --> 04:52.293
that whoever's hiding
the missile

04:52.295 --> 04:53.594
will have a temporary
security system in place

04:53.596 --> 04:55.495
until the sale is complete,

04:55.497 --> 04:57.763
most likely
on a Wi-Fi transmitter.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.564
Well, if we build
a strong Wi-Fi receiver

04:59.566 --> 05:02.333
and get it close enough to a
cluster of suspected buildings,

05:02.335 --> 05:03.967
then the bounce-back
of Wi-Fi signals

05:03.969 --> 05:07.337
can map out the negative space
in the building like radar.

05:07.339 --> 05:08.705
And we can see a general shape
of what's in the building

05:08.707 --> 05:10.640
via reading software
on our laptops.

05:10.642 --> 05:13.376
Okay, but how do we get
the tech into Kazakhstan?

05:13.378 --> 05:14.844
Even a cursory profile
at customs

05:14.846 --> 05:16.846
will show we're
government contractors.

05:16.848 --> 05:19.548
You'll go in undercover
as a film crew

05:19.550 --> 05:22.350
shooting behind-the-scenes
DVD footage

05:22.352 --> 05:25.286
for a Hollywood production in
Kazakhstan for the tax breaks.

05:25.288 --> 05:27.955
Here's the dossiers.

05:27.957 --> 05:31.491
And they contain information
on the film production

05:31.493 --> 05:33.826
and on your new identities.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.400
<i> Super Fun Guy?</i>

05:43.402 --> 05:45.301
They told the message boards
they were gonna be

05:45.303 --> 05:46.669
shooting in Bulgaria
to throw them off!

05:46.671 --> 05:48.771
But I knew the topography
of Bulgaria did not match

05:48.773 --> 05:51.540
Super Fun Guy's
Temple of Chuckles!

05:51.542 --> 05:54.276
Wow!
This is gonna be so much fun.

05:54.278 --> 05:55.610
Excuse me, do you
have enough Hmm?

05:55.612 --> 05:58.012
coverage for your son
until tomorrow afternoon?

05:58.014 --> 06:00.447
Because you're gonna need to
be on point on this mission.

06:00.449 --> 06:01.681
Your friends seem unable to be

06:01.683 --> 06:02.948
anything other
than what they are,

06:02.950 --> 06:04.416
and if you guys
are gonna get in

06:04.418 --> 06:05.717
and out of Kazakhstan
without be--

06:05.719 --> 06:07.351
I'll need to be
the face of a regular,

06:07.353 --> 06:08.719
normal film crew, got it.

06:08.721 --> 06:09.753
On it.

06:09.755 --> 06:11.554
Setting stun gun
to Tons of Fun!

06:11.556 --> 06:14.823
(laughing)

06:14.825 --> 06:16.925
Fantastic.

06:19.029 --> 06:21.729
Hey, I got this for you.

06:21.731 --> 06:23.964
You can park it
outside the dollhouse.

06:23.966 --> 06:27.033
(imitates motorcycle engine)

06:27.035 --> 06:29.035
Thank you.

06:29.037 --> 06:30.903
It's nice.

06:36.977 --> 06:40.445
I thought her dad said the best
bet was to give her space.

06:40.447 --> 06:42.046
I am.
We're just friends.

06:42.048 --> 06:43.414
You and I are just friends.

06:43.416 --> 06:45.950
How come I've never
gotten a gift?

06:45.951 --> 06:48.485
I got you a Super Fun Guy
T-shirt from that street vendor.

06:48.487 --> 06:49.719
One-- it was a Chinese knockoff.

06:49.721 --> 06:51.320
Two-- it said Super Joy Joy Guy.

06:51.322 --> 06:52.988
And three-- you need
to let this Happy thing lie!

06:52.990 --> 06:55.623
Happy and I
are just friends.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.691
(cell phone ringing)

06:59.761 --> 07:01.844
Megan?

07:01.845 --> 07:03.928
The doctors are moving my
procedure up to tomorrow night.

07:03.931 --> 07:05.997
You can still make it, right?

07:08.468 --> 07:10.468
So, this will really
give us X-ray vision?

07:10.470 --> 07:11.769
Well, in theory.

07:11.771 --> 07:15.038
You know, I set up Wi-Fi
in the trailer for Ray,

07:15.040 --> 07:18.608
so let's test my hypothesis.

07:18.610 --> 07:22.044
Okay, picking up
Wi-Fi bounce back.

07:31.921 --> 07:35.489
Ray, is everything
all right in there?

07:35.491 --> 07:36.723
(loud music playing)

07:36.725 --> 07:38.858
Hey, broseph, what's up?

07:38.860 --> 07:41.393
Nothing.

07:41.395 --> 07:42.894
All right,
I'm gonna get back to it.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.061
Okay.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.396
He's your friend.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.633
Walter, may I talk
to you for a moment?

07:50.635 --> 07:53.502
I'm concerned that the, uh,
the Wi-Fi receiver might be,

07:53.504 --> 07:55.403
uh, detected if it's inspected
too closely by customs.

07:55.405 --> 07:57.371
It's about Kazakhstan.
So, maybe before

07:57.373 --> 07:59.873
we get there, we can put a false
shell around the interior?

07:59.875 --> 08:02.008
Well, that's the thing.
I'm not going.

08:04.012 --> 08:06.645
Um, I don't understand.

08:06.647 --> 08:08.713
I can't go.

08:08.715 --> 08:10.481
I'm not going.

08:10.483 --> 08:12.583
Is this about the flight?

08:12.585 --> 08:14.418
'Cause Paige will be with you.

08:14.420 --> 08:17.587
No, I just...

08:17.589 --> 08:20.556
It's a personal reason,
and I cannot say.

08:20.558 --> 08:22.391
Look, I-I can provide

08:22.393 --> 08:23.725
all the software support
remotely from here

08:23.727 --> 08:25.960
and I will not let you down.

08:25.962 --> 08:29.163
Apart from not going with us
on this case.

08:29.165 --> 08:31.899
Okay, well, have a good flight.

08:49.751 --> 08:51.550
This is what
Homeland got for us?

08:51.552 --> 08:52.951
It makes me miss the garage.

08:52.953 --> 08:54.485
Eh, it could be worse.

08:54.487 --> 08:55.619
Stop complaining.

08:55.621 --> 08:57.621
Cabe, we're helping pilfer

08:57.623 --> 08:59.689
a stolen nuclear warhead
for the good of mankind.

08:59.691 --> 09:02.558
All I'm asking for is a room
without Legionnaire's disease.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.926
Okay, guys, we will
not be here for long.

09:03.928 --> 09:05.560
Okay, once we find the
location of the missile,

09:05.562 --> 09:06.961
Cabe calls it in
to the SEAL team,

09:06.963 --> 09:08.963
and we're out.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.097
Happy, good to go?

09:10.099 --> 09:11.098
Yeah, I'm done.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.499
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:12.501 --> 09:14.601
the world's shortest
boom mic operator.

09:14.603 --> 09:16.353
Whoops.

09:16.354 --> 09:18.104
Wow, you literally
lowered the boom on me.

09:18.106 --> 09:20.473
Let's get to it.
I'll go with.

09:20.475 --> 09:22.942
The guys holding the warhead
might have men patrolling

09:22.944 --> 09:24.710
the base looking
for anyone that might

09:24.712 --> 09:26.412
disrupt their $20 million deal.

09:26.413 --> 09:28.113
I thought you had to leave
your weapon at home

09:28.115 --> 09:30.915
'cause of customs--
what can you do without a gun?

09:31.918 --> 09:34.718
(screams)

09:34.720 --> 09:37.120
He can do that.

09:40.125 --> 09:43.626
Though Super Fun Guy's
fictional domain is Guffaton,

09:43.628 --> 09:44.860
the big-screen version
of his story

09:44.862 --> 09:46.494
will be filmed
right here in Kazakhstan,

09:46.496 --> 09:48.863
where we are behind the scenes.

09:48.865 --> 09:50.764
"Guffaton"?
It's Guffawtown!

09:50.766 --> 09:52.065
Sheesh, Toby, if she
doesn't know the mythology,

09:52.067 --> 09:53.866
she's gonna be busted for sure!

09:53.868 --> 09:55.500
Settle down, Beavis.
I don't anyone cares

09:55.502 --> 09:58.102
what Nerd-burg
Super Dork Guy hails from.

09:58.104 --> 09:59.803
Uh, guys, we got company.

10:00.872 --> 10:03.138
PAIGE:
Uh, nothing to see here.

10:03.140 --> 10:05.540
Just a fake film crew.

10:05.542 --> 10:06.641
TOBY:
He's almost gone.

10:06.643 --> 10:09.610
Be cool.

10:09.612 --> 10:12.980
All right, guys,
let's get back to it.

10:12.982 --> 10:14.881
We've been at it all day;
we got to be getting closer.

10:14.883 --> 10:16.782
We are getting close.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.885
I am picking up a hum
at 41.5 kilohertz.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.686
Building 37?

10:23.523 --> 10:24.955
Nothing.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.724
No wireless signal
from building 37,

10:27.726 --> 10:29.659
so odds are
no missile in there.

10:29.661 --> 10:31.060
You got that, Sly?

10:33.531 --> 10:34.930
Got it.

10:34.932 --> 10:36.164
WALTER:
Okay.

10:36.166 --> 10:37.899
Building 27.

10:37.901 --> 10:41.702
All right, getting closer
to a wireless signal.

10:41.704 --> 10:43.170
Looks like some small crates.

10:43.172 --> 10:46.139
It's too small for a nuke,
but we're getting warmer.

10:46.141 --> 10:48.174
Building 33.
MAN: Hey.

10:49.777 --> 10:52.844
Are you guys with
the<i> Super Fun Guy</i> crew?

10:52.846 --> 10:54.779
PAIGE: Yes.
Who the hell is this?

10:54.781 --> 10:56.981
Happy, if this guy makes a move,
you crack him with the boom mic

10:56.983 --> 10:59.516
and run right to the van.
I'm a location scout.

10:59.518 --> 11:01.818
It seems we've filmed
every bit of this country,

11:01.820 --> 11:05.288
but the idiot producers want us
to find something more exotic.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.657
(chuckles)
You know what it's like.

11:07.659 --> 11:09.258
(scoffs)
Do I.

11:11.195 --> 11:13.662
Well, I'll see you
around the set.

11:13.664 --> 11:14.663
Yeah, right.

11:14.665 --> 11:15.997
Take it easy.

11:15.999 --> 11:18.199
We got three
team members out there,

11:18.201 --> 11:21.168
and the only one you're
concerned with is Happy.

11:21.170 --> 11:23.069
Thought you guys
were just friends.

11:23.071 --> 11:25.004
Sylvester told you my business.

11:25.006 --> 11:26.138
Judas.

11:26.140 --> 11:28.673
Okay, back to building 33.

11:30.143 --> 11:32.143
TOBY: Either that's a missile
on a flatbed truck,

11:32.145 --> 11:34.545
or they got the world's
largest banana in there.

11:34.547 --> 11:36.313
That's not all
that's in there. Look.

11:36.315 --> 11:38.782
They've got on-site
babysitters for the nuke.

11:38.784 --> 11:41.785
Sylvester, give me the longitude
and latitude of building 33.

11:41.787 --> 11:43.787
We're calling in the Navy SEALs.

11:43.789 --> 11:46.756
SYLVESTER: Roger that. That's one
rogue nuclear missile captured.

11:47.992 --> 11:50.158
I hate to say it,
but this one was easy.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.293
We deserve easy once in a while.
Copy that.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.028
It's a shame we can't stay long
enough to catch some filming,

11:54.030 --> 11:56.030
get Sylvester
a souvenir from set.

11:56.032 --> 11:58.298
I will never understand
the allure of comic books.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.099
Superheroes, evil villains.

12:00.101 --> 12:02.167
It's nonsense.
We do it all the time.

12:02.169 --> 12:04.769
We aren't mortals who got powers
from radiation exposure.

12:04.771 --> 12:07.071
We're simply organisms

12:07.073 --> 12:08.972
with abnormally dense
brains that process glucose

12:08.974 --> 12:12.075
at a rate high enough to allow
for an advanced thought process.

12:12.077 --> 12:13.810
Not to mention men
fighting each other

12:13.812 --> 12:16.245
in skin-tight latex suits
and identity-concealing masks.

12:16.247 --> 12:19.715
Don't get me started on those
psychological underpinnings.

12:19.717 --> 12:20.782
(knocking on door)

12:21.985 --> 12:23.150
LOCATION SCOUT:
Guys, it's me.

12:23.152 --> 12:25.685
It's that location scout.

12:25.687 --> 12:27.953
LOCATION SCOUT: The, uh,
the Kazakh police is after me.

12:27.955 --> 12:30.689
I didn't have a permit on me and
I don't have any bribe money.

12:30.691 --> 12:32.691
Hey, I saw your
van outside.

12:32.693 --> 12:34.793
Guys, please.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.327
Before somebody sees
me out here.

12:36.329 --> 12:38.128
We don't want
the authorities led here.

12:38.130 --> 12:40.629
He's right. Let him in.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.265
Thank you.

12:44.267 --> 12:47.001
Those cops will take
your gold fillings.

12:47.003 --> 12:48.268
Nobody move.

12:48.270 --> 12:49.602
Or I'll kill her.
Hey, hey, hey.

12:49.604 --> 12:51.737
Easy, pal.
Pockets inside out.

12:51.739 --> 12:53.972
All of you. We don't have any weapons.
Just take it easy.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.239
We're just a film crew.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.041
Oh, really?
Uh-huh.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.842
Then why is it when you were
talking into the microphone,

12:58.844 --> 13:01.277
nothing... nothing was
registering on her laptop?

13:01.279 --> 13:02.311
Huh?

13:02.313 --> 13:05.781
Because it wasn't
plugged in.

13:05.783 --> 13:10.652
Which means that you...
are after something else.

13:10.654 --> 13:11.919
You are spies.

13:11.921 --> 13:13.921
There must be a-a
malfunction with...

13:13.923 --> 13:16.890
My father worked for the Soviet
radio-- I know sound equipment.

13:16.892 --> 13:19.826
Then-then you'll know that...
that they can malfunction.

13:19.828 --> 13:21.761
So, please, please,
before you hurt

13:21.763 --> 13:25.164
innocent people, just...
inspect my cameras.

13:25.166 --> 13:26.899
I'm sure that you'll find
that there was a-a defect

13:26.901 --> 13:28.100
that was interfering

13:28.102 --> 13:30.102
with the mic transmission.

13:30.104 --> 13:32.904
Hold it up.
Hold it up so I can see it.

13:32.906 --> 13:34.305
With pleasure.
(grunting)

13:38.277 --> 13:40.877
Nice tackle, boss.

13:42.313 --> 13:44.913
Four years all-county.

13:44.915 --> 13:45.046
I still got it.

13:50.153 --> 13:52.653
How many men are inside that
building guarding the missile?

13:52.655 --> 13:55.989
Four.
No, uh, seven.

13:55.991 --> 13:58.057
Maybe 12--
I really can't remember.

13:58.059 --> 14:00.292
Did you tell anyone about us?
Yup--

14:00.294 --> 14:01.993
Super Fun Guy.

14:01.995 --> 14:04.061
He's not gonna tell us
anything. Let's just leave

14:04.063 --> 14:06.430
before his friends
start looking for him.

14:06.432 --> 14:08.031
We have Navy SEALs preparing
to storm that building.

14:08.033 --> 14:09.766
They could be walking
into a trap if this guy

14:09.768 --> 14:11.667
told his buddies about
suspicious Americans

14:11.669 --> 14:13.068
moving around the base.

14:13.070 --> 14:14.803
(phone rings)

14:14.805 --> 14:16.871
Cooper, what do you got?

14:18.674 --> 14:21.074
Copy.
Understood.

14:21.076 --> 14:24.210
All right, stick by the horn,
Katherine. We might need you.

14:24.212 --> 14:26.212
I like nothing about the tenor
of that phone call.

14:26.214 --> 14:28.214
Well, we don't have to
worry about the Navy SEALs

14:28.216 --> 14:29.982
walking into a trap.
They've been grounded.

14:29.984 --> 14:31.817
Homeland picked up
chatter from this guy

14:31.819 --> 14:34.219
telling his
buddies about us.

14:34.221 --> 14:36.354
He promised to check us out
further and call them back

14:36.356 --> 14:38.089
within ten minutes
with an update.

14:38.091 --> 14:39.990
And then, when he didn't,
they figured he was in trouble

14:39.992 --> 14:42.926
and that outside forces, namely
the American government,

14:42.928 --> 14:45.128
were aware of their
imminent warhead deal.

14:45.130 --> 14:46.429
Gets better.

14:46.431 --> 14:48.931
Our arms dealer pals?

14:48.933 --> 14:51.700
They used their pull
with the Kazakh government.

14:51.702 --> 14:53.868
They've secured the borders
and grounded flights in and out

14:53.870 --> 14:55.970
of the country,
claiming a swine flu outbreak.

14:55.972 --> 14:57.938
So we're stuck
in a foreign country

14:57.940 --> 14:59.773
with no help
and no way out.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.074
We seem to have a habit

15:01.076 --> 15:03.176
of getting into situations
like this, don't we?

15:03.178 --> 15:05.244
Where is Super Fun Guy
when you need him?

15:17.958 --> 15:19.958
PAIGE:
<i>Can we sneak across the border?</i>

15:19.960 --> 15:22.961
This isn't the U.S. and Mexico.
We'd get caught.

15:22.963 --> 15:25.763
There is dense forest
in the country's interior.

15:25.765 --> 15:27.231
Maybe you could
hide out there while Cooper

15:27.233 --> 15:29.166
sets up an extraction
in a week or so.

15:29.168 --> 15:31.401
Maybe wait for things
to calm down a bit?

15:31.403 --> 15:33.469
Hey, chief, where would one
find a plunger? Not now.

15:33.471 --> 15:34.903
Roger that.
CABE: We're not running,

15:34.905 --> 15:36.104
we're not hiding.

15:36.106 --> 15:37.839
And even if we could
get out of here,

15:37.841 --> 15:39.373
that nuke sale would
till go through, and the buyer

15:39.375 --> 15:42.342
ain't gonna be a decorator
buying an accent piece.

15:42.344 --> 15:44.143
We might want
to get out of here,

15:44.145 --> 15:46.845
but that missile-- we're gonna
see it again, guaranteed,

15:46.847 --> 15:49.080
when it hits Atlanta,
Chicago or L.A.

15:49.082 --> 15:52.149
Okay, okay, so, problem solving
101: what is our goal?

15:52.151 --> 15:54.050
We need to get to the nuke.
Right, okay,

15:54.052 --> 15:55.785
and what's our obstacle?

15:55.786 --> 15:57.519
Guaranteed death
from Eastern Bloc mobsters.

15:57.522 --> 15:59.388
So we can't get into that
building. Kind of a roadblock.

15:59.390 --> 16:02.090
Not if we don't
want to go in that building.

16:02.092 --> 16:03.391
But we could go under
it. Look at this.

16:03.393 --> 16:06.761
Here are the guards.
Here's the missile,

16:06.763 --> 16:09.296
and look at this convex circle
on the floor here.

16:09.298 --> 16:11.131
Is that a defect
in the concrete?

16:11.133 --> 16:13.533
Or a metal hatch.
Kazakhstan has bad winters.

16:13.535 --> 16:15.501
U.S. colleges have underground
tunnels so students

16:15.503 --> 16:18.237
don't have to walk for miles
in the snow. Why not this place?

16:18.239 --> 16:20.305
SYLVESTER: I'm in the
schematics of the base.

16:20.307 --> 16:22.874
Happy was right.
There are multiple steam tunnels

16:22.876 --> 16:24.809
crisscrossing between the
buildings. If you can make it

16:24.811 --> 16:27.878
to building 28, there's a tunnel
that runs 50 yards to the hatch

16:27.880 --> 16:30.013
that Happy spotted
in the missile warehouse.

16:30.015 --> 16:32.882
Okay, okay. So, back
to problem solving 101.

16:32.884 --> 16:35.851
Once we're in,
how do we disable

16:35.853 --> 16:38.486
a Soviet-era nuclear warhead
resting on a flatbed truck

16:38.488 --> 16:40.321
with armed guards
in the next room?

16:40.323 --> 16:41.855
Delicately.

16:41.857 --> 16:43.556
I could rewire it,
but that just slows the bad guys

16:43.558 --> 16:45.858
until they find someone
to fix it after we're gone.

16:45.860 --> 16:48.026
What if we just leave it
where it is and neutralize it?

16:48.028 --> 16:49.994
Neutralize enriched uranium?

16:49.996 --> 16:52.162
Yeah, if you submerge uranium
for two minutes in nitric acid,

16:52.164 --> 16:53.530
it will lose efficacy.

16:53.532 --> 16:55.064
They'd be selling a dud.
Okay, cool,

16:55.066 --> 16:56.398
we'll just run down
to the corner store,

16:56.400 --> 16:58.366
pick up some peanut
brittle and nitric acid.

16:58.368 --> 17:00.685
SYLVESTER:
He's right.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.003
But you can get nitric acid
from a munitions factory.

17:03.005 --> 17:06.006
It's a main component
in gunpowder.

17:06.008 --> 17:09.209
Just did a quick search
and there is a munitions plant

17:09.211 --> 17:11.444
12 miles from your location.
WALTER: Okay, great work.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.846
Now text the address and then
hack the ministry of defense

17:13.848 --> 17:15.398
to get the specs
of that plant.

17:15.399 --> 17:16.949
Okay, I just sent the address.
(watch beeping)

17:16.951 --> 17:19.318
And I will get you
those specs in a bit.

17:19.320 --> 17:20.952
Uh, no, I-I need it now, pal.

17:20.954 --> 17:23.087
You will get them
before you arrive.

17:23.089 --> 17:24.154
Sylvester?

17:24.156 --> 17:27.290
(phone rings)

17:27.292 --> 17:28.891
Hello?

17:28.893 --> 17:31.059
Hey.
I'm just checking in

17:31.061 --> 17:32.860
because I know
you're going to prep soon.

17:32.862 --> 17:34.261
I'm scared.

17:34.263 --> 17:35.862
And I know what it's like

17:35.864 --> 17:37.530
to be scared
better than anybody else.

17:37.532 --> 17:41.133
But tonight you're gonna
wake up in recovery, 100% fine,

17:41.135 --> 17:43.301
and I will be there
to tell you so.

17:43.303 --> 17:44.902
Sylvester,

17:44.904 --> 17:47.938
I really do love you.

17:47.940 --> 17:49.940
I love you, too.

17:49.942 --> 17:52.242
I'll see you tonight.

17:52.244 --> 17:54.043
Okay.

17:56.113 --> 17:58.513
I'm sorry to hear
your friend is sick.

17:58.515 --> 18:00.982
Seriously?
We have to put a bell on you.

18:00.984 --> 18:02.383
I know how you feel.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.635
No, you don't.
You feel powerless,

18:04.636 --> 18:06.886
because you can't do anything
to make her situation better.

18:06.889 --> 18:09.556
Right?
You are ill-informed.

18:09.558 --> 18:11.157
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:11.159 --> 18:13.192
I have to hack into the
Kazakhstan Ministry of Defense.

18:13.194 --> 18:15.494
Bro, I've lived in a Gremlin
for two years.

18:15.496 --> 18:17.496
I know about feeling powerless.

18:17.498 --> 18:19.397
But it doesn't last forever.

18:19.399 --> 18:23.200
Opportunities to be strong
present themselves every day.

18:23.202 --> 18:24.935
Like thunderstorms.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.604
Thunderstorms don't
present themselves every day.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.439
Now who's ill-informed?

18:34.179 --> 18:36.512
CABE: Security inside
each main entrance.

18:36.514 --> 18:39.515
Patrol car looping the grounds.
Everything's watched.

18:39.517 --> 18:42.050
Don't think we can
tell 'em we're a film crew

18:42.052 --> 18:44.085
doing a piece on nitric acid.

18:44.087 --> 18:45.886
Nobody's watching those domes.

18:45.888 --> 18:48.054
TOBY: Who the hell would want
to break into a water tower?

18:48.056 --> 18:50.356
Actually, they're filled
with sand, because nothing

18:50.358 --> 18:51.890
is more dangerous
than a chemical fire

18:51.892 --> 18:53.958
in a munitions factory.
Now, in a fire,

18:53.960 --> 18:56.427
those dozen tanks
around the building launch sand

18:56.429 --> 19:00.097
through those pipes right inside
to suffocate the flames.

19:00.099 --> 19:01.298
I stand corrected.
Who the hell

19:01.300 --> 19:02.565
would want
to break into a sand tower?

19:02.567 --> 19:04.633
We would. Now, I'd hack
the building's server,

19:04.635 --> 19:06.101
set off the fire alarm.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.103
The deluge system
kicks in, sending sand--

19:08.105 --> 19:10.572
and one of us--

19:10.574 --> 19:12.507
flying into
the chemical storage room.

19:12.509 --> 19:14.141
Right to the nitric acid.

19:14.143 --> 19:16.076
According to the plans Sly sent,

19:16.078 --> 19:18.244
we'd go through the east tower.

19:18.246 --> 19:20.212
Workers will think
there's a munitions fire.

19:20.214 --> 19:21.980
They'll be running
out of there like Jesse Owens.

19:21.982 --> 19:23.915
And whoever's inside
can slip out in the chaos.

19:23.917 --> 19:25.650
Speaking of which,
who will be inside?

19:25.652 --> 19:27.985
Well, nitric acid is dangerous,
so it's always stored

19:27.987 --> 19:30.253
in an airtight,
locked safety cabinet.

19:30.255 --> 19:32.121
We'll need someone
to get in, pick the lock

19:32.123 --> 19:34.589
and then get out
in seconds.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.026
Great.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.501
I'm hacking the fire alarm.

19:48.503 --> 19:50.169
Unlocked.

20:05.419 --> 20:07.585
I'm dropping into the hatch now.

20:07.587 --> 20:09.353
How's it looking in there?

20:12.157 --> 20:14.357
Sandy.

20:14.359 --> 20:15.958
WALTER:
Happy, I'm about to set off

20:15.960 --> 20:17.726
the fire alarm.
Now, on my go, inhale deep,

20:17.728 --> 20:19.728
'cause you're gonna be buried
alive for about 20 seconds.

20:19.730 --> 20:21.396
Oh, sounds lovely.

20:22.565 --> 20:23.697
Okay, go.

20:23.699 --> 20:26.232
(alarm wailing)

20:33.307 --> 20:35.740
(grunts, groans)

20:37.443 --> 20:40.043
Uh, not good.

20:40.045 --> 20:41.177
What's wrong?

20:41.179 --> 20:42.344
My leg is stuck

20:42.346 --> 20:44.312
and I am hanging upside down.

20:47.050 --> 20:48.449
CABE:
You better hustle, kid.

20:48.451 --> 20:50.384
If the firefighters get there
before you get out,

20:50.386 --> 20:51.585
it's over.

20:57.125 --> 21:00.126
Okay. I hate to complain,

21:00.128 --> 21:02.595
but I'm getting
a little dizzy here.

21:02.597 --> 21:04.330
(shouting)

21:04.332 --> 21:08.033
Oh, my axilla.

21:08.035 --> 21:09.601
What you up to,
just hanging around?

21:09.603 --> 21:11.102
Really?

21:19.311 --> 21:21.511
(grunts)
Come on.

21:21.513 --> 21:22.678
(groans)
Sorry.

21:24.081 --> 21:25.580
Okay, what are you thinking,

21:25.582 --> 21:27.348
candy's gonna come out of me?

21:27.350 --> 21:28.749
I can't reach.

21:28.751 --> 21:30.283
Quit screwing around!

21:30.285 --> 21:31.651
Firefighters will be there
in minutes!

21:31.653 --> 21:33.019
I got an idea.

21:34.122 --> 21:35.621
What are you doing?

21:35.623 --> 21:36.688
I am taking my pants off.

21:36.690 --> 21:39.357
Dear Diary, it finally happened.

21:39.359 --> 21:41.392
Okay, look out.

21:42.795 --> 21:45.762
Uh...

21:45.764 --> 21:46.796
just friends.

21:46.798 --> 21:47.797
WALTER:
Guys, hurry up.

21:47.799 --> 21:50.065
Clock's ticking.

21:52.169 --> 21:53.701
The lock's a joke.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.269
I'll been in in a sec.

21:56.605 --> 21:58.171
Open.

21:59.107 --> 22:00.172
Okay, help me pull.

22:00.174 --> 22:01.540
(grunts)

22:01.542 --> 22:03.675
Got it!

22:03.677 --> 22:07.111
As much as I hate saying this,
you need to put this on.

22:08.047 --> 22:09.346
(coughing)

22:09.348 --> 22:11.581
(shouting in Russian)

22:14.419 --> 22:15.518
Let's go!

22:19.056 --> 22:20.439
I can't believe that worked.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.823
I can't believe
I left my pants in there.

22:21.825 --> 22:23.524
I'm so glad
I brought extra clothes.

22:23.526 --> 22:24.658
You did?

22:24.659 --> 22:25.791
Don't sound so disappointed.

22:25.794 --> 22:27.727
It's creepy. Okay, all
we have to do now

22:27.729 --> 22:30.096
is take the underground
tunnel to the nuclear warhead,

22:30.098 --> 22:32.431
compromise the uranium,
and then get out of here.

22:32.433 --> 22:35.600
All right, so we have a shot.

22:35.602 --> 22:37.635
We have no shot.

22:37.637 --> 22:40.371
PAIGE:
All those people--

22:40.373 --> 22:42.139
there's no way we get
in there and into the tunnel

22:42.141 --> 22:44.541
without getting caught.
Sly, are you sure there's

22:44.543 --> 22:46.676
no other tunnels leading
to the missile warehouse?

22:46.678 --> 22:48.844
No, just building 28. Why?

22:48.846 --> 22:50.845
Nerds beat us to it.

22:54.517 --> 22:57.150
That's the Super Fun Guy movie.

22:57.152 --> 22:57.478
WALTER: No. That

22:57.504 --> 22:58.784
is our one shot

22:58.786 --> 23:01.620
at getting to the warhead
going up in smoke.

23:06.193 --> 23:07.859
I can't believe it.
We've stopped falling planes,

23:07.861 --> 23:09.460
crashing satellites,
escaped from Cuba,

23:09.462 --> 23:13.464
but we're finally bested
by a Hollywood film crew?

23:13.466 --> 23:15.499
HAPPY: Let's just blow past
these artsy-fartsy punks.

23:15.501 --> 23:17.200
PAIGE:
There's security.

23:17.202 --> 23:19.402
They catch us, call the cops,
we're nailed with fake I.D.'s.

23:19.404 --> 23:21.203
Say good-bye to America
for the next ten years.

23:21.205 --> 23:23.605
I'm more concerned about
the psychos with the missile.

23:23.607 --> 23:25.773
They're on high alert.
They smell something fishy,

23:25.775 --> 23:27.608
gunplay breaks out

23:27.609 --> 23:29.442
and some of those
film crew civilians get hurt.

23:29.445 --> 23:31.445
Um, guys, I just saw
a bunch of extras dressed

23:31.447 --> 23:33.580
as Super Fun Guy
and his Krazy Krew, which means

23:33.582 --> 23:35.582
they must be shooting
his epic battle

23:35.584 --> 23:37.250
versus the Imposter Roster.

23:37.252 --> 23:38.751
Great.
Go to NeverKissedAGirl.com

23:38.753 --> 23:39.852
and tell them all about it.

23:39.854 --> 23:42.287
No, I-I am trying
to make a point.

23:42.289 --> 23:45.657
There are all those people
out there, in disguises,

23:45.659 --> 23:48.526
walking freely about the
building we're trying to access.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.294
Okay, I pick up
what you're laying down,

23:50.296 --> 23:51.862
but how do we get the costumes?

23:53.232 --> 23:54.898
Leave that to me.

23:54.900 --> 23:58.368
I am looking at the invoice
right now!

23:58.370 --> 24:00.269
Those props were supposed
to be here last night!

24:00.271 --> 24:02.237
So if they're not in my hands
by tonight,

24:02.239 --> 24:04.272
one of us is gonna be looking
for a job,

24:04.274 --> 24:06.407
and it ain't gonna be me.
(quietly): All right, Sylvester.

24:06.409 --> 24:08.742
I'm right by the wardrobe
trailer. Tell me what to get.

24:08.744 --> 24:10.777
Okay. Super Fun Guy, of course.

24:10.779 --> 24:13.312
And then you need two female
costumes. So Patty Prankenstein

24:13.314 --> 24:14.913
and Zany Zoe.

24:14.915 --> 24:17.415
Don't need a backstory,
Poindexter. Just give me colors.

24:17.417 --> 24:19.750
Teal, orange, red, blue, green.

24:21.854 --> 24:24.654
(scatting softly)

24:28.726 --> 24:30.525
How's it going, guys?

24:40.903 --> 24:43.904
I'm starting to think we should
just let 'em have the nuke.

24:43.906 --> 24:45.805
Oh, wow, you look great!

24:45.807 --> 24:48.740
With great responsibility
comes a great wedgie.

24:51.644 --> 24:53.744
This is just wrong.

24:53.746 --> 24:56.346
I know. Whimsical Boy wasn't
even a part of the Krazy Krew

24:56.348 --> 24:58.214

I don't know how the actors
move in these things.

25:10.427 --> 25:13.761
I want Homeland
to double our fee.

I don't like feeling absurd.

30:38.899 --> 30:40.531
Careful!

30:41.934 --> 30:43.700
We need evac, stat!

30:43.702 --> 30:46.836
We've got hostiles on our tail
and the nuke in our possession!

30:46.838 --> 30:48.137
COOPER:
Homeland can't

30:48.139 --> 30:50.939
direct a chopper.
We're not supposed to be there!

30:50.941 --> 30:53.875
So that's it? You're just gonna
leave us high and dry?!

30:53.877 --> 30:56.911
No, no, no.
Homeland can't help you.

30:56.913 --> 30:59.914
But if an international
organization of 28 nations

30:59.916 --> 31:02.650
had proof
that a humanitarian mission

31:02.652 --> 31:06.020
that was safeguarding civilians
from a nuke was in jeopardy,

31:06.022 --> 31:07.621
different story!

31:07.623 --> 31:09.990
Okay! I follow!

31:11.860 --> 31:13.025
Sly, I need you

31:13.027 --> 31:14.159
to get to NATO and tell 'em

31:14.161 --> 31:15.627
we need an extraction!

31:15.629 --> 31:18.496
But I've only ever driven once,
as you know.

31:18.498 --> 31:21.031
No buts! I need you to get
a photograph to NATO!

31:21.033 --> 31:24.000
(computer beeps)

31:25.703 --> 31:27.602
Oh, boy, this is not good.

31:36.112 --> 31:38.011
Cabe? Cabe? Cabe?!

31:39.581 --> 31:42.181
I just looked up the address to
the NATO office. Now get on!

31:42.183 --> 31:44.950
What, on-on Happy's
organ-donation machine?!

31:44.952 --> 31:46.651
You want to stop
feeling powerless?

31:46.653 --> 31:49.053
You want to be a hero like
your pals are being right now?

31:49.055 --> 31:50.621
Then this is your moment,
big fella.

31:50.623 --> 31:53.523
Seize it like a superhero would.

31:53.525 --> 31:56.259
(screaming)

32:00.531 --> 32:02.130
Get the lead out, Hap.

32:02.132 --> 32:03.965
This thing only
has so much in her.

32:04.968 --> 32:07.201
I can't hold them off forever!

32:07.203 --> 32:09.136
Almost there!

32:09.138 --> 32:11.138
Oh, no!

32:13.008 --> 32:15.808
Ow, my face!

32:15.810 --> 32:17.142
Nice shot!

32:17.144 --> 32:18.943
Yeah, but now we
don't have any acid,

32:18.945 --> 32:20.878
so we can't
dissolve the uranium.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.846
And those guys will be
catching up to us soon enough.

32:22.848 --> 32:24.280
Okay, what's our plan B?

32:24.282 --> 32:25.648
There's only one option.

32:25.650 --> 32:27.783
Toby, get online
and search for

32:27.785 --> 32:31.086
Kazakhstan's
precious mineral history.

32:31.088 --> 32:32.754
I'm on it, pal.

32:32.756 --> 32:34.622
But I don't like
where you're going with this.

32:39.128 --> 32:41.094
I thought you said
disarming the nuke

32:41.096 --> 32:43.796
was a delay tactic,
not a solution.

32:43.798 --> 32:45.564
That's not what I'm doing.

32:45.566 --> 32:47.599
I'm arming it.

32:50.770 --> 32:52.102
My name is Sylvester Dodd.

32:52.104 --> 32:54.070
I work with Agent Cabe Gallo,
badge number 2835.

32:54.072 --> 32:56.305
I'm requesting
an immediate extraction

32:56.307 --> 32:58.106
from a humanitarian mission
in Kazakhstan,

32:58.108 --> 32:59.907
where they are there
protecting civilians

32:59.909 --> 33:01.308
from illegal nuclear weapons.

33:02.978 --> 33:06.679
We're the National Association
of Theater Owners.

33:06.681 --> 33:08.981
You want the NATO on Pico.

33:09.917 --> 33:11.316
That's my bad.

33:22.929 --> 33:24.728
No choppers.

33:24.730 --> 33:26.763
Come on, Sly, don't let us down.

33:26.765 --> 33:28.231
You know, Walter,
when I was ten,

33:28.233 --> 33:30.833
I got suspended for setting
an M-80 off in a toilet.

33:30.835 --> 33:31.934
This is worse.

33:31.936 --> 33:33.135
There are no other options.

33:33.137 --> 33:34.769
There are no
civilians for miles.

33:34.771 --> 33:36.604
And the mine's
been shut for years

33:36.606 --> 33:37.972
because the land's
already toxic.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.773
Toxic, not blown up.

33:39.775 --> 33:41.207
The entry shaft
goes down 13 miles

33:41.209 --> 33:43.042
at a 42-degree angle.

33:43.044 --> 33:45.778
Now, the U.S. detonated nukes

33:45.780 --> 33:47.880
just a few hundred feet

33:47.882 --> 33:49.781
under Nevada's soil.

33:49.783 --> 33:51.082
Yes, Nevada.
Doing this here?

33:51.084 --> 33:52.783
Kind of an act of war.

33:52.785 --> 33:54.317
We let this fall
into the wrong hands,

33:54.319 --> 33:56.085
it'll be far worse
than eviscerating

33:56.087 --> 33:57.853
an already condemned mine.

33:57.855 --> 33:59.921
Son, I got all the faith
in the world in you.

33:59.923 --> 34:02.657
But if we fire this off and
the choppers don't come for us,

34:02.659 --> 34:03.891
we're captured,
we're labeled terrorists,

34:03.893 --> 34:05.759
and then it's lights out.

34:05.761 --> 34:08.128
If there's an abnormal
configuration in this old mine,

34:08.130 --> 34:10.163
the blast could
mushroom-cloud right under us.

34:10.165 --> 34:11.731
We'd all be cooked.

34:11.733 --> 34:13.899
Are you certain about this?

34:13.901 --> 34:15.901
No, it's effectively
an experiment.

34:15.903 --> 34:17.636
And experiments
have uncertainties.

34:17.638 --> 34:19.004
Fantastic.

34:19.006 --> 34:22.206
What I am certain of
are my abilities.

34:24.076 --> 34:27.043
Maybe it's the outfit,
but I'm with Walter.

34:27.045 --> 34:29.111
Okay, our friends are back.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.779
Okay, okay.

34:31.781 --> 34:34.248
Happy, raise the flatbed
to a 21-degree angle.

34:34.250 --> 34:37.684
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

34:43.891 --> 34:46.124
Guys, get down!

34:53.132 --> 34:54.998
It worked.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.199
It's gone.

34:56.201 --> 34:57.300
We did it.

34:57.302 --> 34:58.868
(guns click)

34:58.870 --> 35:02.137
You just cost me $20 million.

35:02.139 --> 35:05.406
Now you all die.

35:14.116 --> 35:15.315
Any ideas, Walt?

35:15.317 --> 35:16.816
I don't want to die
in this outfit.

35:16.818 --> 35:18.350
Listen, these guys
are just hired guns.

35:18.352 --> 35:19.784
They follow my orders.

35:19.786 --> 35:20.951
They had nothing
to do with this.

35:20.953 --> 35:23.053
(shouting in Russian)

35:23.055 --> 35:26.322
(gasping, yelling)

35:27.858 --> 35:29.724
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

35:32.361 --> 35:34.361
Looks like the Giggler
delivered the punch line.

35:34.363 --> 35:37.230
Did you just KO that guy?

35:37.232 --> 35:38.798
It must be the uranium.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.065
(helicopter flying nearby)

35:40.067 --> 35:42.067
Oh, that-that works.

35:43.804 --> 35:45.870
Sylvester did it.

35:55.347 --> 35:59.048
I can't believe how awesome
we must look right now.

36:12.196 --> 36:13.495
You made it.

36:13.497 --> 36:15.830
Of course I did.
I promised.

36:17.099 --> 36:19.165
You brought a friend?

36:19.167 --> 36:22.368
And a motorcycle helmet?

36:22.370 --> 36:23.902
Wild day?

36:23.904 --> 36:26.438
Not really.

36:26.439 --> 36:28.973
The hardest thing I had to do
was visit a bureaucrat's office.

36:28.975 --> 36:31.041
Did you know there
are two NATOs?

36:31.043 --> 36:32.509
PAIGE:
<i> I don't know about you guys,</i>

36:32.511 --> 36:34.244
<i> but I'm ready</i>
<i> to catch some Z's.</i>

36:34.246 --> 36:36.012
TOBY: <i> I'm so tired,</i> <i> I
couldn't catch anything.</i>

36:36.014 --> 36:38.114
How's your hand?

36:38.116 --> 36:40.983
Sore.

36:40.985 --> 36:44.853
Well, that's the difference
between gloves and no gloves.

36:44.855 --> 36:46.120
Got to say, I was impressed
with your right.

36:46.122 --> 36:47.121
You turned your hips.

36:47.123 --> 36:48.789
I have a decent teacher.

36:48.791 --> 36:50.924
You still interested
in getting in the ring?

36:50.926 --> 36:52.992
No clue why, but yeah, I am.

36:52.994 --> 36:55.461
Grab your gear and meet me
out front in five minutes.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.129
I'm taking you into Monty's Gym.

36:57.131 --> 36:59.131
You got to start sparring.

36:59.133 --> 37:00.899
And, uh,

37:00.901 --> 37:03.534
thanks for saving my ass
out there today.

37:03.536 --> 37:06.003
Cabe, are we becoming friends?

37:06.005 --> 37:09.006
Now you ruined it.

37:09.008 --> 37:10.974
Where the hell's my bike?

37:10.976 --> 37:13.142
Come to think of it,
where's Sylvester?

37:13.144 --> 37:15.210
(tires squeal)

37:16.880 --> 37:19.013
Hey!

37:19.015 --> 37:21.148
No one rides my rides.

37:21.150 --> 37:22.415
It's all right.

37:22.417 --> 37:23.883
I needed a ride to
order the helicopter,

37:23.885 --> 37:25.017
and Ray got me there.

37:25.019 --> 37:26.418
Just getting back now?

37:26.420 --> 37:27.786
All night bowling.

37:27.788 --> 37:28.853
Won every frame.

37:28.855 --> 37:31.188
WALTER:
That's incredible, Sylvester.

37:31.190 --> 37:32.889
You got on a motorcycle.

37:32.891 --> 37:34.891
I told you I'd
get the job done.

37:34.893 --> 37:37.059
Yeah, you did, at... at that.

37:37.061 --> 37:38.927
RAY: Speaking of getting
the job done, Wally,

37:38.929 --> 37:40.561
I fixed everything in here.

37:40.563 --> 37:42.462
Patched all the walls,
repaired all the pipe fittings,

37:42.464 --> 37:44.797
so no more leakage.

37:44.799 --> 37:45.397
What is that?

37:45.399 --> 37:46.564
What?

37:46.566 --> 37:47.498
That.

37:47.500 --> 37:50.501
Nothing, just...
a T-shirt.

37:50.503 --> 37:52.069
You are not part of Scorpion.

37:52.071 --> 37:53.270
But I live here.

37:53.272 --> 37:55.505
So does a possum in the rafters.

37:55.507 --> 37:57.540
Well, I did kind of
help you guys,

37:57.542 --> 37:59.141
you know, get out
of Kazakhstan, so....

37:59.143 --> 38:01.109
But it's spelled wrong.
We're a team of geniuses.

38:01.111 --> 38:03.578
Two P's-- got it.

38:03.580 --> 38:06.180
Eh...
Got it!

38:10.085 --> 38:11.384
Oh, hey, uh...

38:13.388 --> 38:16.489
You really
came through for us today.

38:16.491 --> 38:18.891
Even with my
messed-up EQ,

38:18.893 --> 38:21.059
I can tell that there's
something weighing on you.

38:21.061 --> 38:24.262
Is there something
that you want to discuss or...?

38:24.264 --> 38:26.397
Yes, there is.

38:26.399 --> 38:28.832
But I can't.

38:30.402 --> 38:32.402
Okay.

38:32.404 --> 38:35.337
If you change your mind,
then, uh...

38:37.407 --> 38:39.173
Okay... Oh!

38:39.175 --> 38:40.541
Ah! (laughs)

38:40.543 --> 38:43.377
Almost forgot.

38:43.379 --> 38:44.945
Got something for you.

38:44.947 --> 38:48.014
I, uh, thought you
might like it.

38:48.016 --> 38:50.082
My costume.

39:00.126 --> 39:02.126
Hey, I'm going to start
wiring the dollhouse,

39:02.128 --> 39:03.427
if you want to help.

39:04.396 --> 39:06.229
I got plans with Cabe.

39:06.231 --> 39:08.231
Uh... rain check?

39:08.233 --> 39:09.498
Uh, sure.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.099
That's cool.

39:12.102 --> 39:13.901
Well, have fun with Cabe.

39:13.903 --> 39:15.402
See you.

39:17.539 --> 39:19.238
What just happened?

39:19.240 --> 39:21.173
You've been waiting for an in
with Happy for months,

39:21.175 --> 39:22.474
and she just gave it to you.

39:22.476 --> 39:24.375
Did the spandex cut off
the blood to your brain?

39:24.377 --> 39:26.643
Several times today,
I realized

39:26.645 --> 39:28.344
I can't just be friends
with her.

39:28.346 --> 39:30.179
I am an addict.

39:30.181 --> 39:32.314
First with gambling,
then with her.

39:32.316 --> 39:35.050
For her it's wiring a dollhouse;
to me, it's an alcoholic

39:35.052 --> 39:36.651
just rubbing his lips
against the beer bottle.

39:36.653 --> 39:38.386
I can't do it.

39:38.388 --> 39:40.020
So, what's the new plan?

39:40.022 --> 39:41.988
There's only one way
to break an addiction.

39:41.990 --> 39:43.456
Cold turkey.

39:43.458 --> 39:45.925
I'm done with her.

39:48.262 --> 39:51.096
Overheard your conversation
with Sylvester.

39:51.098 --> 39:53.398
That was a nice
thing you did.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.133
Thought of a
coworker's feelings,

39:55.135 --> 39:56.901
put yourself in his
shoes, made a gesture.

39:56.903 --> 39:59.003
That's real progress, Walter.

39:59.005 --> 40:01.138
Human progress.

40:01.140 --> 40:03.340
Does that makes you happy?

40:03.342 --> 40:05.375
Me being more human?

40:05.377 --> 40:07.443
Yes, because I know
in the long run

40:07.445 --> 40:09.678
it makes you happier.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.079
You're doing great.

40:11.081 --> 40:12.647
Keep it up, Clark.

40:12.649 --> 40:13.981
"Clark"?

40:13.983 --> 40:16.016
Clark Kent--
Superman's alter ego.

40:16.018 --> 40:18.418
You know, you're
out of costume now,

40:18.420 --> 40:20.420
so now you're Clark Kent.
You know what?

40:20.422 --> 40:24.457
I'll never understand
why people get so worked up

40:24.459 --> 40:27.326
over something that's not real.

40:27.328 --> 40:28.560
Oh, I don't know about that.

40:28.562 --> 40:30.662
When I think about the people
we work with--

40:30.664 --> 40:33.031
extraordinary people
with special abilities

40:33.033 --> 40:35.433
doing their best to help others?

40:35.435 --> 40:38.269
Today you saved lives
by stopping a rogue nation

40:38.271 --> 40:39.570
from getting a nuclear weapon.

40:39.572 --> 40:42.005
If that's not proof
that superheroes exist,

40:42.007 --> 40:43.306
I don't know what is.

40:43.308 --> 40:45.675
Zany Zoe played her part.

40:45.677 --> 40:48.377
No, I'm just Lois Lane.

40:48.379 --> 40:50.963
You know,

40:50.964 --> 40:53.548
Sylvester says that Lois Lane
was pretty important.

40:53.550 --> 40:55.116
And, um...

40:57.153 --> 40:59.486
...you did look, um...

40:59.488 --> 41:02.055
uh, nice in that costume.

41:02.057 --> 41:04.457
Thanks.

41:04.459 --> 41:06.959
You looked nice, too.

41:09.029 --> 41:10.461
All right, well,
I got to go get Ralph.

41:10.463 --> 41:11.562
Have a nice night.
Okay.

41:11.564 --> 41:13.063
Yeah, sure.
You, too.

41:14.066 --> 41:16.332
Oh. Sly.

41:16.334 --> 41:18.233
Um, so, Clark Kent.

41:18.235 --> 41:21.569
How did things with him
and Lois Lane play out?

41:21.571 --> 41:24.238
Some stories they get together,
but it doesn't last long.

41:24.240 --> 41:27.374
That's kind of the price
of being a superhero.

41:27.376 --> 41:30.510
No girls, no
glory, no fame.

41:30.512 --> 41:34.013
Saving the world
gets in the way of life.

41:34.015 --> 41:36.148
I guess with great
responsibility

41:36.150 --> 41:38.750
comes great... loneliness.

41:41.988 --> 41:44.655
Thank you for the rundown.

41:59.271 --> 42:01.070
(metallic scraping)

42:03.774 --> 42:05.340
Seriously, Ray?

42:05.342 --> 42:07.408
RAY: I can fix it!
Can totally fix that!
