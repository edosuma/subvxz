WEBVTT

00:44.753 --> 00:50.050
II'

00:53.595 --> 00:55.597
Good morning,
Your Royal Highness.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.764
I am sorry to disturb you,
sir, but I've just heard

00:57.808 --> 00:59.685
the Russian exhibits
have been held up.

00:59.851 --> 01:02.062
Held, held up? By ice.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.397
In the Baltic.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.148
It's been a long winter.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.067
It has been a long winter.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.277
Well.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.570
Albert,

01:09.736 --> 01:11.196
you must come
and have breakfast.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.073
Your Majesty. Ah, Mr. Cole.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.408
You're here already.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.870
Albert, I know you're busy,
but you must eat.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.623
The Russian ships have frozen
in the Baltic.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.500
Promise
the exhibition will be fine

01:23.667 --> 01:26.044
without a few sable pelts
and dried herrings.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.463
Actually, ma'am, they were
sending samples of minerals

01:28.630 --> 01:30.632
that could...
Won't it, Mr. Cole?

01:30.799 --> 01:32.175
Mmm.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.844
II'

01:35.220 --> 01:37.472
Very well.

01:44.021 --> 01:48.483
II'

01:50.736 --> 01:51.570
Awful-.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.655
Colonel Sibthorp.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.158
Demanding purl: A stop

01:56.325 --> 01:59.119
to this "crystal abomination."

01:59.286 --> 02:00.746
Really.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.664
Can't he see
Albert's a visionary?

02:02.831 --> 02:07.044
Perhaps only a wife can
truly appreciate his... genius.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.088
What do you mean? Just that...

02:11.840 --> 02:14.134
Your belief in Albert

02:14.301 --> 02:17.804
must be such a solace to him
at the moment.

02:17.971 --> 02:22.351
People are being so unkind.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.895
Monmouth says Sophie has taken
a turn for the worse.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.898
I had no idea it was so serious.

02:28.065 --> 02:28.899
Did you, Emma?

02:29.066 --> 02:31.735
Why, no, ma'am.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.905
In fact, she has been
looking very well of late.

02:35.072 --> 02:38.033
Bloooming, I would say.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.618
She's suffering from...

02:39.785 --> 02:41.828
some kind of inflammation
of the brain

02:41.995 --> 02:44.247
that requires complete rest
and seclusion.

02:47.292 --> 02:50.212
II'

03:03.225 --> 03:04.768
I am so sorry

03:04.935 --> 03:07.437
to have been
the bearer of bad news.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.606
It is so illogical.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.024
The United States have sent

03:11.191 --> 03:12.693
their steam-powered
threshing machine,

03:12.859 --> 03:14.736
and now the vice president
is concerned

03:14.903 --> 03:17.197
about hailstones breaking
the glass roof.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.782
What does it matter

03:18.949 --> 03:20.343
if some lily-livered American
won't show up?

03:20.367 --> 03:21.647
The exhibition is
for the people,

03:21.785 --> 03:23.120
and I'm sure they can't wait

03:23.286 --> 03:25.205
to see their steam-powered
threshing machine.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.624
Hmm. Adelheid.

03:27.791 --> 03:31.211
Let me introduce
my foreign secretary,

03:31.378 --> 03:32.879
Lord Palmerston.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.762
Serene Highness.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.058
Adelheid has
barely left the school room,

03:45.225 --> 03:46.268
Lord Palmerston.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.854
Heidi,

03:49.020 --> 03:52.816
we must talk about your dress
for the exhibition.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.943
I only have two dresses,

03:55.110 --> 03:56.862
and I'm afraid
they are not chic.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.905
Then we must go and talk
to my dresser.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.299
And I'm sure Feo would be happy

04:00.323 --> 04:02.993
to lend you some
of her new jewels.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.787
Feodora, of course,

04:05.954 --> 04:07.873
you will be looking for a match

04:08.039 --> 04:09.166
for Heidi, no'?

04:09.332 --> 04:11.084
Eh, she's still so young.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.045
Ah, well, the king of Prussia's
brother Sigmund will be coming.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.256
If Heidi were to find him
agreeable,

04:16.423 --> 04:18.341
I think it could be
most suitable.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.469
Vicky, of course,
will marry the crown prince,

04:20.635 --> 04:22.471
but until then,
it could be beneficial

04:22.637 --> 04:24.556
to have an ally in Berlin.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.725
Do you not think,
Lord Palmerston?

04:26.892 --> 04:28.185
If you say so, sir.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.438
You are most thoughtful, Albert.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.816
II'

04:34.983 --> 04:38.320
"Prince Florizel asked the king
if he could marry his daughter.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.447
"And the king,
with tears in his eyes,

04:40.614 --> 04:42.783
"gave him his blessing.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.536
"And so Aurora and Florizel
were married.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.581
"And they lived happily
ever after.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.250
The end."

04:52.417 --> 04:53.417
Now...

04:53.543 --> 04:56.755
Time for bed.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.132
Time for bed.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.721
Good night.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.389
Papa told Aunt Feo

05:06.556 --> 05:08.391
that I'm going to marry
the crown prince

05:08.558 --> 05:09.558
and live in Berlin.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.312
But I want to stay here,
with you.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.523
Yes, well, you do now,

05:14.689 --> 05:20.904
but one day,
you'll want your own family.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.697
But I promise,

05:22.864 --> 05:24.157
when you do marry,

05:24.324 --> 05:26.451
you will marry just as did...
For loves.

05:26.618 --> 05:30.539
Do you think cousin Adelheid
will marry for love?

05:30.705 --> 05:32.040
Yes.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.042
Yes, I'm, I'm sure she will.

05:34.209 --> 05:37.462
Will Papa come
and say good night?

05:37.629 --> 05:39.381
Maybe not tonight, darling.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.007
Now, bed.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.596
Good night.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.098
Good night, Mama.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.227
Russell.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.229
I've just had a dispatch

05:54.396 --> 05:55.522
from Paris.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.773
There's been a coup,

05:56.940 --> 05:59.401
and Louis Napoleon has declared
himself emperor.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.237
Who'd have thought
that after Waterloo

06:02.404 --> 06:04.739
there would be
another Bonaparte emperor?

06:04.906 --> 06:06.217
Well,
he's nothing like his uncle.

06:06.241 --> 06:07.284
He's even shorter,

06:07.450 --> 06:08.660
apparently,

06:08.827 --> 06:10.412
and he has no plans
to attack Britain.

06:10.579 --> 06:11.663
How can you be sure?

06:11.830 --> 06:13.070
Well, because he'll be too busy

06:13.164 --> 06:14.541
licking his own country
into shape.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.043
You seem very confident.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.879
He may be a Frenchman,

06:19.045 --> 06:22.090
but Louis Napoleon is someone
I can do business with.

06:25.719 --> 06:32.142
II'

06:44.112 --> 06:46.114
I want to <i>see</i> my sen.
I'm sure you do.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.800
However, I think
he would find the sight

06:47.824 --> 06:48.824
of his lunatic mother

06:48.950 --> 06:51.077
rather distressing.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.121
Don't you?

06:53.288 --> 06:54.408
Perhaps it's time I sent you

06:54.539 --> 06:56.207
to the asylum,

06:56.374 --> 06:58.501
where you can be properly
cared for.

07:00.629 --> 07:04.925
There is nothing wrong with me.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.469
When the queen hears
about what you've done,

07:07.636 --> 07:09.763
she will demand
that you set me free.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.306
Oh, how remiss of me.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.100
Her Majesty sent over
some calf's foot jelly.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.978
She does so hope you'll be
better for the exhibition.

07:17.145 --> 07:20.941
What a shame
you'll have to disappoint her.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.746
Oh, The <i>Times</i> today said,

07:34.913 --> 07:37.165
"The influx of visitors
from all over the world

07:37.332 --> 07:40.460
"will likely result in
fermentation of a new plague,

07:40.627 --> 07:43.004
just as the Black Death followed
the Crusades."

07:44.589 --> 07:48.093
How, how can a,
a respectable newspaper print

07:48.259 --> 07:49.719
such utter nonsense?

07:49.886 --> 07:51.680
Don't think
there is such? A thing

07:51.846 --> 07:53.056
as a respectable paper, sir.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.265
Albert.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.934
ALBERT Hmm?

07:56.101 --> 07:57.560
Your Majesty.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.229
Ah, you're still working.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.522
How can I sleep

08:00.689 --> 08:02.857
knowing that we have not sold
enough tickets?

08:05.276 --> 08:06.556
But I thought
the excursion fares

08:06.653 --> 08:08.005
were going to make
all the difference.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.389
They are helping,
certainly, ma'am,

08:09.531 --> 08:12.784
but no 0ne's buying
the season tickets.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.954
It seems that society women

08:16.121 --> 08:19.457
do not wish to rub shoulders

08:19.624 --> 08:22.293
with the ruffians
and foreigners.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.757
Might they want to shake hands
with their queen?

08:29.426 --> 08:30.885
Why, yes indeed, ma'am.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.763
Mmm, then I think
we have a solution, Mr. Cole.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.432
Victoria, no.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.350
I do not want to use you
to sell tickets.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.768
And I, Albert,

08:38.935 --> 08:41.229
do not want
your great creation to fail.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.940
And more importantly,
I want you to get some sleep.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.698
Perhaps you are right. Yes.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.116
Indeed.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.496
Good night, Mr. Cole.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.123
Ma'am.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.961
Come on.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.464
Yes, very well, very well.

09:25.148 --> 09:30.528
II'

09:40.080 --> 09:44.959
II'

09:51.091 --> 09:55.428
It is magnificent, my love.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.890
But it will still be there
in the morning.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.683
In Burma,

10:00.850 --> 10:03.978
the kings, they have
these sacred elephants

10:04.145 --> 10:06.815
that are silver in color.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.484
And if a king gives an elephant
to a subject,

10:09.651 --> 10:12.153
it is seen as a sign
of great fortune.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.740
The animals are too sacred
to put to work,

10:15.907 --> 10:18.451
and of course
they cannot be sold.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.578
They are so expensive to keep,

10:20.745 --> 10:24.874
that sometimes the new owners
are forced to choose

10:25.041 --> 10:26.751
between feeding their children

10:26.918 --> 10:30.296
and feeding the beast.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.676
That is what The <i>Times</i> called
this today.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.011
A white elephant.

10:37.178 --> 10:41.349
I am afraid I have built
a monument to my own folly.

10:41.516 --> 10:45.103
Fiddlesticks.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.564
People just have to get used
to the idea, that's all.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.191
And if they do not?

10:50.358 --> 10:52.694
Well, if they do not...

10:58.116 --> 11:02.162
Then you will still be
my husband,

11:02.328 --> 11:04.747
the father of my children,

11:04.914 --> 11:08.418
my beloved.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.588
II'

11:17.886 --> 11:20.388
Your hand is like ice.

11:20.555 --> 11:24.225
II'

11:40.158 --> 11:43.703
Your Serene Highness!

11:43.870 --> 11:45.580
What are you doing in the park?

11:45.747 --> 11:48.291
I'm coming to see
the prince's creation.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.461
Ah.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.588
She's a fine-looking girl,
your Heidi.

11:53.755 --> 11:58.218
Too pretty to marry a Prussian.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.136
She could do much better.

12:00.303 --> 12:03.765
Louis Napoleon has declared
himself emperor of France.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.059
He's going to need an empress.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.187
II'

12:09.354 --> 12:11.231
I can't imagine why a man

12:11.397 --> 12:13.399
who distrusts the French
as you do

12:13.566 --> 12:15.485
would suggest such a match.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.655
Well, the Russian bear would
like to sweep up the Balkans

12:18.821 --> 12:20.240
in its claw.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.051
All they would need to do
is find a common cause

12:22.075 --> 12:24.077
with a country
with an excellent navy

12:24.244 --> 12:27.038
and ambitions to recreate
their lost dominance of Europe.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.123
France, for example.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.417
That would be
most unfortunate for us.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.878
II'

12:34.045 --> 12:36.256
And you think Heidi
could prevent this alliance?

12:38.007 --> 12:40.051
I think if she's anything
like her mother,

12:40.218 --> 12:42.887
then Britain's interests
will be quite safe.

12:44.138 --> 12:47.141
Of course.

12:47.308 --> 12:51.771
And as empress,
she would outrank everyone.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.232
Even the Queen of England.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.402
Good day.

12:57.568 --> 13:01.572
II'

13:07.036 --> 13:09.414
Have you heard from
the duchess of Monmouth, ma'am?

13:09.580 --> 13:12.917
I hope she is recovering
from her illness.

13:17.005 --> 13:21.342
The duke said she is no better.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.678
Would you like me to make
some inquiries,

13:23.845 --> 13:27.223
ma'am?

13:27.390 --> 13:29.684
Yes.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.269
Yes, perhaps you should.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.816
I'll write a letter to Sophie.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.445
To be delivered in person.

13:40.611 --> 13:41.946
That's a good idea.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.034
Glad you approve, Turner.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.746
II'

13:53.124 --> 13:54.876
Oh, isn't it lovely?

13:55.043 --> 13:57.462
I don't want to take it off even.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.589
Aunt Victoria has been so kind.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.008
I love her so much.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.552
Well,

14:04.719 --> 14:07.597
she can afford to give you
lovely things.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.475
And Uncle Albert says he thinks
I will like Prince Sigmund.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.352
Imagine living in Berlin!

14:12.518 --> 14:17.023
Mmm, imagine...

14:17.190 --> 14:18.649
living in Paris.

14:18.816 --> 14:22.862
Once again, Palmerston
has exceeded his authority.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.823
He had no right
to congratulate Napoleon on,

14:25.990 --> 14:27.550
on making himself
emperor of the French.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.244
I don't understand

14:30.411 --> 14:32.091
how this Bonaparte
can make himself emperor

14:32.163 --> 14:33.414
just like that.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.892
After all that we have done
to cultivate

14:34.916 --> 14:36.376
a good relationship
with Prussia,

14:36.542 --> 14:39.796
Palmerston has congratulated
their greatest enemy.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.965
I think you are not alone
in deploring his action, sir.

14:43.132 --> 14:47.428
I suspect that for once,
the foreign secretary

14:47.595 --> 14:50.681
will not have the support
of the country.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.225
Or the Commons.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.772
Ah, Feodora.

14:57.939 --> 14:58.981
Can it be right

14:59.148 --> 15:00.858
that you were seen

15:01.025 --> 15:03.444
in the park today,
talking with Lord Palmerston?

15:03.611 --> 15:08.116
Oh, he accosted me, Albert.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.826
I didn't want
to cut him in public,

15:09.992 --> 15:11.327
much as I would have liked to.

15:11.494 --> 15:14.288
Yes, well he has put the
whole exhibition in jeopardy

15:14.455 --> 15:17.083
with his support
of Louis Napoleon.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.127
I thought the Prussians
would withdraw,

15:19.293 --> 15:20.461
but I explained to the king.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.296
Palmerston does not
speak for the crown.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.715
I think he speaks
only for himself.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.760
Well, I must say I am pleased

15:27.927 --> 15:30.138
that Prince Sigmund
will still be coming.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.098
Oh, you are so kind, Albert.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.059
To think of my little Heidi
at a time like this.

15:35.226 --> 15:40.148
Well, I know how much
her happiness matters to you.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.779
I acted in
the national interest, ma'am.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.906
Of which you are
the sole guardian?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.742
Of course not,

15:51.909 --> 15:54.412
but this country's reputation
is my greatest concern.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.500
Which is why I'm here.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.503
Thank you.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.009
Is it true that you're going

16:08.176 --> 16:10.016
to attend the public opening
of the exhibition?

16:10.052 --> 16:11.929
Of course.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.644
Think of all that glass,
such a tempting target.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.936
Oh, don't be so lily-livered.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.039
You've been against the
exhibition from the beginning.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.440
Well, the British public

16:22.607 --> 16:24.442
don't take well to hyperbole,
ma'am.

16:24.609 --> 16:25.836
The minute you call something
great,

16:25.860 --> 16:27.060
they just want to belittle it.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.864
So what do you suggest?

16:31.449 --> 16:33.993
Stay away from the exhibition.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.121
Let it be the prince's project,
and not the crownks.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.419
But the queen told me to give
this to the duchess in person.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.213
No one is allowed up there,
miss.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.340
Not even to clean
or empty the slops.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.596
Do you think the duchess
is very ill?

17:00.228 --> 17:01.562
What kind of an illness is it

17:01.729 --> 17:03.564
when a patient has to be
lockedin

17:03.731 --> 17:05.441
when the nurses come down
for their meals?

17:12.573 --> 17:14.408
My dress is pink,

17:14.575 --> 17:18.162
and so is Vicky's,
and Bertie will wear his kilt.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.540
It's important people recognize

17:20.706 --> 17:22.291
the prince of Wales.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.210
People are talking
of nothing else

17:24.377 --> 17:25.962
but the exhibition, ma'am.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.798
Excuse me, ma'am.

17:28.965 --> 17:32.176
Went to Monmouth House
as you asked me to,

17:32.343 --> 17:35.263
and I wasn't allowed
to see the duchess.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.015
It is my belief that she
has been confined to her room

17:38.182 --> 17:39.308
on the grounds of insanity.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.644
Insanity?

17:41.811 --> 17:45.815
Sophie is not a lunatic.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.263
No, but I suspect the duke
does not agree with you, ma'am.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.657
Please find the duke of Monmouth

17:54.824 --> 17:57.326
tell him? Wish
to speak with him.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.412
At once.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.210
Let Brodie go.

18:06.377 --> 18:09.463
Want to wring
his aristocratic: Neck.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.756
I could do it, too.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.043
Just like killing a chicken,

18:12.174 --> 18:13.718
one quick twist.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.112
Which is why you mustn't
go near him, Joseph.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.220
He's a powerful man.

18:16.387 --> 18:17.763
I don't care what he does to me.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.475
He has no right to lock her up.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.607
I would lay down my life
for her, Abigail.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.241
Don't look so surprised.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.702
You think a footman
isn't capable of real feeling?

18:40.995 --> 18:42.496
And a good-looking young man

18:42.663 --> 18:45.124
could use a duchess
for his own advancement.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.711
Oh, not everyone thinks
like you, Mr. Penge.

18:50.880 --> 18:55.092
You don't think I am capable of
real feeling, Mrs. Turner?

19:01.182 --> 19:02.308
Brodie?

19:02.475 --> 19:08.731
II'

19:14.195 --> 19:15.655
Whoa.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.175
Emily!

19:36.342 --> 19:38.552
You look surprised, Henry.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.847
I hope I'm not spoiling
any of your plans.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.600
You know that you are
the only plan worth following.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.222
But what are you doing here?

19:47.353 --> 19:48.729
You hate London in the season.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.707
The queen invited me to
the opening of the exhibition.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.051
Oh, and you left Ireland
for that?

19:52.191 --> 19:55.569
I could hardly refuse
a royal command,

19:55.736 --> 19:57.446
and besides,
I am looking forward to seeing

19:57.613 --> 19:59.407
the famous Crystal Palace.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.700
Crystal Palace?

20:00.866 --> 20:02.576
Crystal Carbuncle, more like.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.179
It's full of the world's
impedimenta.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.080
Or a step
towards the realization

20:06.247 --> 20:07.456
of the unity of mankind?

20:07.623 --> 20:09.166
Emily, please.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.269
You know what sententious
claptrap does to my poor nerves.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.129
Have you ever considered
the possibility

20:13.295 --> 20:14.714
that the prince is right?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.006
Never!

20:18.926 --> 20:21.679
God made Britain an island

20:21.846 --> 20:23.305
for a reason.
So God's an Englishman?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.307
Hmm, of course.

20:25.474 --> 20:30.020
Are you sure Louis Napoleon
deserves your support?

20:30.187 --> 20:33.774
Is that why you're here?

20:33.941 --> 20:35.421
I didn't think you cared
for politics.

20:42.908 --> 20:47.079
It isn't politics I care for,
Henry.

20:53.461 --> 20:57.006
Since you are determined
to proceed,

20:57.173 --> 21:02.303
there is nothing I can do
to prevent a vote of censure

21:02.470 --> 21:07.349
against the foreign secretary
for his letter of congratulation

21:07.516 --> 21:09.769
to the so-called emperor
of the French.

21:09.935 --> 21:13.773
But Palmerston has stuck
to the Foreign Office

21:13.939 --> 21:15.399
like a limpet

21:15.566 --> 21:20.070
through every crisis
of his own making.

21:20.237 --> 21:24.658
This time, we must be sure

21:24.825 --> 21:26.076
of getting him out.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.042
The duke of Monmouth, ma'am.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.677
Your Majesty.

21:45.596 --> 21:47.932
Is it true, Duke,

21:48.098 --> 21:51.811
<i>that the duchess,</i>
my <i>mistress of the robes,</i>

21:51.977 --> 21:55.689
is being confined in your house
as a lunatic?

21:55.856 --> 21:57.399
Given the duchess's
mental state,

21:57.566 --> 21:59.360
I'm afraid I had no choice...

21:59.527 --> 22:03.781
I don't believe there's anything
wrong with Sophie's mind.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.909
Bu': The doctors who examined her
would disagree with you.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.162
Really?

22:12.164 --> 22:14.583
In my experience,

22:14.750 --> 22:16.126
men only call women mad

22:16.293 --> 22:19.255
when they are doing something
inconvenient.

22:19.421 --> 22:23.133
Her behavior has been more
than inconvenient, ma'am.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.136
It has been... wanton.

22:26.303 --> 22:30.015
The doctors call it
hysterical nymphomania.

22:30.182 --> 22:34.228
So you see, ma'am,
I had no choice.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.313
She is my wife,

22:36.480 --> 22:40.025
and I regret to say she is mad.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.987
Duke.

22:45.114 --> 22:50.452
I expect to see the duchess
at the exhibition tomorrow.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.623
You may leave us.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.710
II'

23:08.554 --> 23:15.853
II'

23:28.616 --> 23:33.495
II'

23:47.426 --> 23:49.011
Wake up, Mama!

23:49.178 --> 23:51.180
Wake up!

23:51.347 --> 23:54.350
I think Papa is dead!

23:54.516 --> 23:55.643
Come on, Mama!

24:03.108 --> 24:09.031
II'

24:09.198 --> 24:10.324
Albert.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.163
Albert!

24:17.915 --> 24:20.084
Albert! What?

24:20.250 --> 24:21.961
Victoria?

24:22.127 --> 24:23.379
Bertie?

24:23.545 --> 24:25.255
What... what is happening?

24:25.422 --> 24:27.424
I'm so sorry, Papa.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.676
I wanted to talk to you...

24:28.842 --> 24:30.511
He thought you were dead.

24:30.678 --> 24:34.098
Oh, well,
well, as you can see, l...

24:36.058 --> 24:37.559
I'm very much alive.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.562
But only just, Albert, you...

24:40.729 --> 24:42.690
cannot go on like this.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.650
Victoria, I do not think

24:44.817 --> 24:47.152
you should accompany me
tomorrow.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.404
I do not want you

24:48.570 --> 24:51.073
tainted by my failure.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.200
Bertie.

24:53.367 --> 24:54.702
Off to bed with you.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.883
Do you know that Palmerston
said the same thing to me today?

25:12.261 --> 25:17.141
I would have to be
really quite stubborn.

25:17.307 --> 25:21.895
One might even say...
irrational,

25:22.062 --> 25:24.857
to ignore both of you,
don't yQu think?

25:25.024 --> 25:28.235
Of course I'm coming with you,
Albert.

25:29.403 --> 25:33.615
II'

25:54.595 --> 25:58.390
II'

26:00.434 --> 26:02.061
Papa, your hand is very cold.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.606
That... that is because
I am nervous.

26:05.773 --> 26:09.359
Well, I think you have nothing
to worry about.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.863
It's time.

26:13.030 --> 26:16.950
II'

26:21.830 --> 26:23.707
Good morning, Mr. Cole.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.042
Your Majesty.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.609
You see we have
the queen's weather.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.607
I hope you've come to tell me
the tickets have all sold.

26:30.631 --> 26:31.715
Well, yes, ma'am.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.122
And the park is completely full

26:33.175 --> 26:34.676
with what I believe
are well-wishers.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.637
What else could they be?

26:36.804 --> 26:39.056
Well, Inspector Dorbiney thinks

26:39.223 --> 26:42.476
the crown might not be
entirely benign.

26:42.643 --> 26:46.230
You think there could be
trouble, Inspector?

26:47.397 --> 26:48.982
Your Royal Highness,

26:49.149 --> 26:51.026
with so many people gathered
in one place,

26:51.193 --> 26:52.945
it doesn't take much
to turn a crowd.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.613
What would you suggest?

26:54.780 --> 26:56.925
Sir, I would suggest that
you enter through the back way,

26:56.949 --> 26:58.826
in a closed carriage.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.261
And that your children
should remain

27:00.285 --> 27:01.912
in the safety of the palace.

27:02.079 --> 27:04.456
I cannot put you
and the children in danger.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.959
Do you have confidence
in your creation, Albert?

27:07.126 --> 27:08.877
Because even if you don't,

27:09.044 --> 27:11.296
I do.

27:12.714 --> 27:14.007
PRESS.

27:15.676 --> 27:20.556
II'

27:27.604 --> 27:28.689
Does the queen know?

27:28.856 --> 27:29.982
What, that I'm a Chartist?

27:30.149 --> 27:31.400
Yes, she does.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.360
Lam not in the habit
of pretending to be

27:33.527 --> 27:35.028
someone I'm not. Abigail!

27:35.195 --> 27:36.321
Please...

27:36.488 --> 27:38.949
PRESS.

27:39.116 --> 27:41.076
Wasn't pretending all the time-.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.164
Mrs. Turner to you,
Inspector Dorbiney.

27:45.330 --> 27:51.920
II'

28:07.603 --> 28:11.899
II'

28:34.004 --> 28:36.173
Look at all these people, Henry.

28:38.008 --> 28:40.802
All wearing their Sunday best
for the exhibition.

28:40.969 --> 28:45.224
How do you know they haven't
turned out to see me, M?

28:48.435 --> 28:52.522
Louis Napoleon?

28:52.689 --> 28:55.734
Keep smiling, darling.

29:01.907 --> 29:07.037
II'

29:26.390 --> 29:31.270
II'

30:00.173 --> 30:01.675
It's the eighth
wonder of the world.

30:01.842 --> 30:04.136
I'm so proud of you.

30:40.505 --> 30:41.798
Your Majesty,

30:41.965 --> 30:44.176
we are living at a period

30:44.343 --> 30:46.928
of most wonderful transition.

30:47.095 --> 30:51.350
We are moving towards
that great end,

30:51.516 --> 30:54.269
the realization of the unity

30:54.436 --> 30:55.937
of all mankind.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.648
The distances that separated
the different countries

30:58.815 --> 31:00.025
are rapidly vanishing

31:00.192 --> 31:03.653
with the achievements
of modern invention.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.198
The world is getting smaller.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.034
And the aim of the exhibition

31:09.201 --> 31:12.162
is to unite the art and industry

31:12.329 --> 31:15.999
from every nation on the Earth.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.335
Thank you.

31:23.006 --> 31:25.759
There were many who
said this could not be done.

31:25.926 --> 31:30.013
But they did not possess
the vision of one man,

31:30.180 --> 31:33.016
my husband,

31:33.183 --> 31:34.893
and his accomplice,
Sir Henry Cole,

31:35.060 --> 31:39.481
who understood that the nations
of the world were ready,

31:39.648 --> 31:42.901
for this festival of peace.

31:43.068 --> 31:46.613
And now it is
with the greatest pleasure

31:46.780 --> 31:50.117
that I declare the exhibition
open.

31:55.539 --> 32:01.753
II'

32:17.644 --> 32:18.770
Sophie.

32:20.230 --> 32:22.482
I'm so glad to see you here.

32:22.649 --> 32:23.733
Fully recovered, I hope?

32:23.900 --> 32:25.819
Yes, ma'am.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.696
So you have no need
for your attendants.

32:28.989 --> 32:30.449
Ma'am.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.033
And Duke. Ma'am.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.036
You must be dying to inspect
the steam threshing machine.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.538
Ma'am.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.918
Ah, better, I think.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.085
Yes, ma'am.

32:43.170 --> 32:44.296
Mama, look!

32:46.339 --> 32:47.466
Excuse me.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.343
Excuse me, Your Grace.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.029
I think you'll find
the American gallery

32:52.053 --> 32:53.263
very much to your taste.

32:56.850 --> 32:59.728
I hope you will be careful.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.563
Your husband is watching.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.899
But maybe this is the moment
you could slip away

33:04.065 --> 33:05.192
unobserved.

33:10.280 --> 33:16.495
II'

33:16.661 --> 33:18.663
Your Majesty.

33:21.958 --> 33:24.002
This is a most impressive
gathering,

33:24.169 --> 33:26.379
and everything
completely on time.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.048
Congratulations to you both.

33:28.215 --> 33:29.758
Oh, thank you.

33:29.925 --> 33:33.637
And also the, the roof has not fallen in.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.516
May introduce my daughter Vicky.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.059
Vicky, this is His Majesty

33:39.226 --> 33:43.188
the king of Prussia,
and his son the crown prince.

33:45.649 --> 33:46.816
Your Highness.

33:46.983 --> 33:49.277
Dearest Sigmund,

33:49.444 --> 33:51.655
may I also introduce my niece,

33:51.821 --> 33:52.948
Adelheid.

33:54.616 --> 33:57.202
But family and friends
call me Heidi.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.703
Cousin Heidi,

33:58.870 --> 34:01.540
I would like to show you
the pavilion of my country.

34:01.706 --> 34:04.417
There is a piece of coal
that is resembling a dachshund.

34:05.835 --> 34:12.592
II'

34:15.554 --> 34:16.763
Sigmund and Adelheid

34:16.930 --> 34:19.933
seem to be enjoying
one anothefs company.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.104
What a matchmaker you are,
Albert.

34:28.900 --> 34:34.990
II'

34:40.787 --> 34:42.747
I thought I'd
never see you again.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.879
There is a boat
that sails to New York tomorrow

34:50.046 --> 34:53.383
from Liverpool.

34:53.550 --> 34:54.634
Meet me at Euston tonight

34:54.801 --> 34:57.012
and we can catch the train
together.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.974
America, Sophie.

35:01.141 --> 35:03.226
A place where we don't
have to be

35:03.393 --> 35:04.477
duchesses and footmen.

35:04.644 --> 35:11.234
II'

35:11.401 --> 35:12.944
It won't be the life
you are used to,

35:13.111 --> 35:17.699
but it will be a life
based on love.

35:17.866 --> 35:21.369
You know how much
I want to be with you,

35:21.536 --> 35:24.581
but how can I leave William?

35:24.748 --> 35:26.124
Monmouth would never let him go.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.960
But William won't be
a child for long.

35:32.797 --> 35:37.302
II'

35:48.229 --> 35:49.689
Thank you.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.860
Before you start,
I should tell you.

35:54.027 --> 35:55.320
I'm leaving the palace.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.072
Actually, Joseph...

36:02.619 --> 36:04.788
I came to ask your pardon.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.626
For misjudging you-

36:09.793 --> 36:11.169
When you came to the palace,

36:11.336 --> 36:14.047
I took you
for the kind of unscrupulous man

36:14.214 --> 36:17.634
who would do anything
for his own advantage.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.678
I see now that I was wrong.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.934
No, Mr. Penge,
you were quite right.

36:26.101 --> 36:28.687
I was looking for advantage.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.690
But instead I found...

36:31.856 --> 36:35.485
Someone whose happiness was
more important than your own.

36:38.780 --> 36:40.657
I do remember what it's like

36:40.824 --> 36:44.411
to lose your reason
over a woman.

36:44.577 --> 36:47.622
And I hope you have
more luck than I had.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.334
Now...

36:51.501 --> 36:53.878
You should leave quickly
before the duke sees you.

36:56.506 --> 36:58.717
II'

36:58.883 --> 37:01.761
His Excellency
AliAvani, the envoy from Persia.

37:01.928 --> 37:02.929
AVAIN!: Your Majesty.

37:03.096 --> 37:05.682
Now that you have recovered...

37:05.849 --> 37:08.685
His Excellency Mehmet
Ali, the envoy from Turkey.

37:08.852 --> 37:09.936
Your Majesty.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.813
I trust you will not
have a relapse.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.481
Count Orlov,
representing the tsar.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.571
Because, Sophie,

37:19.738 --> 37:22.240
I set great store
on having you by my side.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.117
II'

37:24.284 --> 37:26.286
The ambassador...

37:26.453 --> 37:31.166
II'

37:35.587 --> 37:38.214
His Excellency the Baron
Aksen, Kingdom of Denmark.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.883
Your Majesty.

37:40.049 --> 37:42.552
Ah, just the man.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.280
Can you tell me the name
of the man with whom

37:44.304 --> 37:46.139
my wife has been consorting?

37:46.306 --> 37:48.516
I'm sorry, Your Grace,

37:48.683 --> 37:52.312
but I cannot help you further.

37:52.479 --> 37:56.483
You know, the thing I prize
more than anything is loyalty.

37:56.649 --> 37:59.778
Then I suspect you are
frequently disappointed,

37:59.944 --> 38:01.613
Your Grace.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.781
In my experience,

38:02.947 --> 38:07.952
loyalty must be earned,
not bought.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.669
Cousin Heidi, I've been
looking for you everywhere.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.884
Will you do me
the very great honor

38:23.051 --> 38:24.594
of becoming my wife?

38:24.761 --> 38:27.222
Bertie, don't you think
I'm a little old for you?

38:27.388 --> 38:28.848
No.

38:29.015 --> 38:32.852
Mama says I'm getting more
grown up every day.

38:33.019 --> 38:36.564
I'm afraid that my mama
has already found me a husband.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.153
Not horrible Sigmund.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.073
With his stupid mustache.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.408
Oh, I quite like Sigmund.

38:47.575 --> 38:52.038
No, she wants me to marry
Louis Napoleon.

38:52.205 --> 38:53.623
Do you love him?

38:53.790 --> 38:56.125
I have never met him.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.419
But she says it is easy to love
an emperor.

38:58.586 --> 38:59.712
Ah!

38:59.879 --> 39:03.675
What a... touching scene.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.221
Foreign Secretary.

39:08.388 --> 39:09.639
Prime Minister.

39:09.806 --> 39:10.849
You look as if you've won

39:11.015 --> 39:12.600
the derby.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.604
Don't tell me the vote
of censure went against me?

39:17.730 --> 39:18.916
Perhaps we could talk privately.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.525
No need.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.419
You'll have my letter
of resignation in the morning.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.070
I'm so sorry that...

39:24.237 --> 39:26.823
Oh, don't pretend you're not
thrilled to be rid of me.

39:28.449 --> 39:29.826
Anwvay, I'm rather
looking forward

39:29.993 --> 39:33.288
to spending more time
with my beautiful wife.

39:33.454 --> 39:38.334
II'

39:42.171 --> 39:44.924
83-blade knife.

39:52.473 --> 39:53.558
Look.

39:53.725 --> 39:57.228
There is even a tuning fork.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.690
Your Majesty, um...

40:03.902 --> 40:08.072
Are you having trouble finding
the right note, Lord Pam?

40:08.239 --> 40:10.033
Has Russell told you?

40:11.743 --> 40:14.120
He was almost jubilant.

40:14.287 --> 40:16.122
Should have listened to you,
ma'am.

40:16.289 --> 40:19.792
You did warn me.

40:19.959 --> 40:21.377
But that was not in your nature.

40:21.544 --> 40:24.422
No, I'm afraid it isn't.

40:24.589 --> 40:28.718
So unlike you to go
against public sentiment.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.137
I knew I was doing
the right thing.

40:34.140 --> 40:37.310
Do you know who you sound like?

40:37.477 --> 40:38.978
My husband.

40:39.145 --> 40:41.356
He was prepared to go
against public opinion

40:41.522 --> 40:44.400
because he knew the end result
would be worth it.

40:47.195 --> 40:50.114
It's a great achievement.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.201
Wish the same could be said
for my career-.

40:53.368 --> 40:57.372
Which is not over, Lord Pam.

40:57.538 --> 41:01.042
II'

41:01.209 --> 41:04.212
Goodbye, ma'am.

41:10.802 --> 41:15.640
II'

41:15.807 --> 41:17.517
We'll be hours waiting
for the carriage.

41:17.684 --> 41:18.935
Do you mind if we walk?

41:19.102 --> 41:21.771
I find myself rather wanting
to go home.

41:21.938 --> 41:24.315
I don't mind at all, Henry.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.651
Are you leaving,
Lord Palmerston?

41:26.818 --> 41:30.363
I was hoping we might talk.

41:30.530 --> 41:34.617
Your Serene Highness,
may I present Lady Palmerston.

41:34.784 --> 41:36.995
Oh.

41:37.161 --> 41:40.873
I'd hoped you might introduce me
to the French ambassador.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.127
I'm sure it can be arranged,
but not by me, I'm afraid.

41:44.293 --> 41:46.170
I'm no longer foreign secretary.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.631
Have you been dismissed?

41:49.799 --> 41:50.967
No, resigned, actually,

41:51.134 --> 41:52.468
but the result is the same.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.179
Ah, well.

41:55.346 --> 41:56.973
What a pity.

41:57.140 --> 42:00.018
It was a role you played
very well.

42:00.184 --> 42:03.104
At least you have your wife
to console you.

42:04.814 --> 42:06.607
He has a wife who'll make sure
that one day,

42:06.774 --> 42:08.234
he becomes prime minister.

42:08.401 --> 42:10.695
Good day, Your Serene Highness.

42:10.862 --> 42:15.742
II'

42:25.126 --> 42:27.086
Ah, Sophie.

42:28.755 --> 42:30.274
I've been thinking
that you should have

42:30.298 --> 42:31.924
your own house in town,

42:32.091 --> 42:35.386
so that your son can stay
with you.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.055
Don't you agree?

42:39.015 --> 42:43.603
William is, is so independent,
now he's gone to school.

42:43.770 --> 42:46.898
He doesn't need me anymore.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.319
I think every woman

42:51.486 --> 42:54.030
sometimes dreams of escape.

42:59.869 --> 43:03.414
But how far would you have to go
to forget your own child?

43:03.581 --> 43:07.502
II'

43:13.007 --> 43:16.385
II'

43:41.285 --> 43:43.579
God save the queen!

43:43.746 --> 43:45.123
God save the queen!

43:45.289 --> 43:48.126
God save the queen!
God save Papa!

43:48.292 --> 43:50.753
II'

43:50.920 --> 43:52.130
God save Prince Albert!

43:52.296 --> 43:54.382
God save Prince Albert!

43:54.549 --> 43:56.551
God save Prince Albert!

43:56.717 --> 43:59.095
God save Prince Albert!

43:59.262 --> 44:01.180
God save Prince Albert!

44:02.849 --> 44:09.021
II'

44:09.188 --> 44:13.109
Take that, Louis Napoleon!

44:13.276 --> 44:14.610
And that!

44:14.777 --> 44:16.487
Bertie.

44:16.654 --> 44:19.907
<i>Wave something for you.</i>

44:20.074 --> 44:23.202
I don't want
your stupid chocolate!

44:26.998 --> 44:28.166
Bertie?

44:28.332 --> 44:30.209
Bertie!

44:30.376 --> 44:31.460
Ha, ha.

44:31.627 --> 44:33.504
Hey.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.339
What's the matter?

44:35.506 --> 44:37.717
My heart is broken.

44:37.884 --> 44:39.886
Oh, I see.

44:41.762 --> 44:43.055
Well, that's very serious.

44:44.724 --> 44:45.725
But you know,

44:45.892 --> 44:49.312
I think hearts can be mended.

44:52.148 --> 44:53.316
Would you like me to try?

44:55.776 --> 44:57.486
You see, Papa,

44:57.653 --> 45:00.656
I've fallen in love with Heidi.

45:00.823 --> 45:04.869
I think she'd be
a very good queen.

45:05.036 --> 45:08.706
But she says Aunt Feo wants her
to marry Louis Napoleon.

45:11.584 --> 45:13.586
And I love her so much.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.631
Well...

45:17.840 --> 45:19.217
I promise.

45:19.383 --> 45:23.054
You will find
someone else to love.

45:23.221 --> 45:25.431
But I won't be a good king
without her.

45:27.391 --> 45:30.102
Dearest Bertie, trust me.

45:30.269 --> 45:35.775
You will not need Heidi
to be a great king.

45:40.321 --> 45:42.657
Come.

45:42.823 --> 45:47.703
II'

45:55.086 --> 45:57.421
When you said you thought
I should be prime minister,

45:57.588 --> 45:59.548
were you being serious?

45:59.715 --> 46:02.134
Yes, Henry.

46:02.301 --> 46:05.721
I think you've had enough
of foreign affairs.

46:05.888 --> 46:09.100
Does that mean you're going
to be staying in London with me?

46:09.267 --> 46:11.394
How else are you going
to lead the country?

46:22.613 --> 46:23.864
PRESS.

46:24.031 --> 46:26.617
Would you mind?

46:29.370 --> 46:31.747
What on Earth is the matter?

46:31.914 --> 46:33.416
I have just...

46:33.582 --> 46:36.419
discovered that your sister
has been conspiring

46:36.585 --> 46:38.713
with Lord... Pilgerstein

46:38.879 --> 46:41.215
so that her daughter
may marry Louis Napoleon.

46:42.550 --> 46:44.385
Ah.

46:44.552 --> 46:47.680
Well, nothing can come of that
now.

46:47.847 --> 46:48.681
What?

46:48.848 --> 46:50.683
Palmerston has resigned.

46:50.850 --> 46:54.353
Nevertheless...

46:54.520 --> 46:56.605
I trusted her.

46:56.772 --> 46:59.442
I confided in her.

46:59.608 --> 47:03.529
And all the
time, she was deceiving me.

47:04.989 --> 47:10.036
You were right about her,
Victoria.

47:10.202 --> 47:12.496
And I should have
listened to you.

47:16.459 --> 47:19.503
Well, take no satisfaction
in being right-.

47:19.670 --> 47:23.674
Well, would you forgive me if I
did not quite believe you?

47:29.263 --> 47:30.765
Ah.

47:30.931 --> 47:34.226
I wanted to congratulate you
once more.

47:34.393 --> 47:37.480
You must be so proud
that all your hard work

47:37.646 --> 47:40.900
has come to such
a splendid resolution.

47:41.067 --> 47:43.069
Oh.

47:43.235 --> 47:48.491
And thank you, Albert, for
introducing Heidi to Sigmund.

47:48.657 --> 47:49.950
I think She likes him.

47:50.117 --> 47:51.452
And, um...

47:51.619 --> 47:54.372
What do you think
Lord Palmerston would say

47:54.538 --> 47:55.831
if she married him?

47:55.998 --> 47:58.000
Lord Palmerston?

47:58.167 --> 48:00.294
No, you, you no longer care
what he thinks

48:00.461 --> 48:03.089
now that he is not
foreign secretary anymore!

48:05.299 --> 48:08.636
You betrayed me, Feodora.

48:11.972 --> 48:14.934
Oh, Albert.

48:15.101 --> 48:16.352
I'm not so bad, really.

48:18.354 --> 48:20.981
I could have allowed Heidi
to accept your son's proposal.

48:22.733 --> 48:24.360
'Tis a pity-

48:24.527 --> 48:27.947
She would have made
a good queen of England.

48:28.114 --> 48:29.240
As I would have done.

48:30.950 --> 48:32.368
But...

48:32.535 --> 48:38.624
have my standards,
and your unfortunate son...

48:38.791 --> 48:39.875
dues nut meet them.

48:40.042 --> 48:44.755
II'

48:44.922 --> 48:48.384
We will leave in the morning.

48:55.766 --> 48:57.143
Fee...

48:57.309 --> 48:58.436
Feo, wait.

49:00.729 --> 49:03.023
Bertie is my son.

49:03.190 --> 49:05.443
He's just a child.

49:05.609 --> 49:09.238
He's a little boy with feelings
too big for his body.

49:11.782 --> 49:14.201
I can remember
what that was like.

49:17.580 --> 49:19.290
I think you can, too.

49:22.501 --> 49:26.130
<i>You don't have to go, Fee.</i>

49:26.297 --> 49:30.384
I know you were only trying
to do your best for Heidi.

49:30.551 --> 49:32.279
The way Mama was only 'trying
to doing her best

49:32.303 --> 49:36.348
when she sent you to Langenburg
to get married.

49:36.515 --> 49:40.936
But I was Mama's child, too.

49:41.103 --> 49:45.649
No one ever did
their best for me.

49:45.816 --> 49:48.194
And you have wanted
to punish me?

49:48.360 --> 49:49.904
For that?

49:50.070 --> 49:56.118
II'

50:01.248 --> 50:04.168
I know you think
that I have everything,

50:04.335 --> 50:05.836
and that you have nothing.

50:09.757 --> 50:12.468
But there is one thing
I don't have.

50:16.096 --> 50:18.224
A sister.

50:18.390 --> 50:22.770
II'

50:56.262 --> 50:57.721
Mama.

50:59.598 --> 51:03.060
I dreamt I was lost,
and I couldn't find you.

51:03.227 --> 51:09.191
II'

51:17.283 --> 51:22.621
II'

51:32.715 --> 51:34.275
Are you going to stand here
every night?

51:36.844 --> 51:41.724
I wanted to remember that
I had done... something right.

51:44.768 --> 51:47.062
Albert, you've done so much.

51:49.648 --> 51:51.609
Do you think it'll
make a difference?

51:51.775 --> 51:53.235
I do.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.697
It was a day to live forever.

51:56.864 --> 51:58.532
And I could not have done it
without you.

51:58.699 --> 52:00.367
Oh, nonsense.

52:01.994 --> 52:05.497
I did everything I could
to stop you.

52:05.664 --> 52:07.499
Not when it mattered.

52:11.128 --> 52:13.297
No.

52:24.391 --> 52:25.768
Are you all right?

52:25.934 --> 52:27.603
All right.

52:27.770 --> 52:30.189
Just tired.

52:30.356 --> 52:33.942
II'

52:37.071 --> 52:39.573
How beautiful you look tonight.

52:43.535 --> 52:46.747
This is where we stood
when you...

52:46.914 --> 52:48.499
Proposed.

52:49.667 --> 52:52.920
You were so nervous.

52:53.087 --> 52:54.380
I was.

52:54.546 --> 52:58.300
It was the biggest decision
of my life.

52:58.467 --> 53:00.844
Was it the right one?

53:06.433 --> 53:12.940
II'

53:17.194 --> 53:18.320
Albert?

53:22.032 --> 53:23.701
Albert!

53:26.453 --> 53:28.288
Albert!

53:30.165 --> 53:32.710
Albert!

53:32.876 --> 53:34.002
Albert!

53:36.338 --> 53:37.423
Albert!

53:37.589 --> 53:42.928
II'
