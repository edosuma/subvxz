Before the show,

07:13.567 --> 07:14.766

I did make a prediction,

07:14.768 --> 07:15.934
I did make a prediction,
so for the first time, could we

07:15.936 --> 07:18.069

please reveal my prediction?

07:21.507 --> 07:24.109

07:26.646 --> 07:31.516
So basically Stacey was wrong.
[Laughter]

I could really do magic,

07:34.521 --> 07:35.487
I could really do magic,
it would look a bit like this.

07:35.489 --> 07:38.824
It would look a bit like this.

Penn and teller already deep

18:40.320 --> 18:41.185
penn and teller already deep
in thought.

18:41.187 --> 18:42.353
In thought.
Now, you do street magic mainly,

18:42.355 --> 18:42.820
now, you do street magic mainly,
don't you?

18:42.822 --> 18:43.638
Don't you?

18:43.639 --> 18:44.455
>> yeah, I do a lot of sort of
street magic.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.257
Street magic.
Close-up is my best.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.125
Close-up is my best.
>> Do you always get it right on

18:47.127 --> 18:47.758
>> do you always get it right on
the street, or when you're up

18:47.760 --> 18:48.626
the street, or when you're up
close, do people--can they--

18:48.628 --> 18:49.627
close, do people--can they--
it is easier for them to see

18:49.629 --> 18:50.495
it is easier for them to see
the workings of what you're

18:50.497 --> 18:51.362
the workings of what you're
doing?

18:51.364 --> 18:52.363
Doing?
>> No, no, that's the great

18:52.365 --> 18:53.331
>> no, no, that's the great
thing I love about close-up

18:53.333 --> 18:54.499
thing I love about close-up
magic, because it's right in

18:54.501 --> 18:55.500
magic, because it's right in
front of them and often in

18:55.502 --> 18:56.367
front of them and often in
their own hands.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.569
Their own hands.
>> Penn, teller,

18:58.571 --> 19:00.304
>> penn, teller,
stop ignoring me.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.639
Stop ignoring me.
[Laughter]

19:01.641 --> 19:02.640
[Laughter]
Okay.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.643
Okay.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.646
>> this is one of my personal
favorite methods in magic.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.314
Favorite methods in magic.
It is--it is terrific.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.816
It is--it is terrific.
It is beautiful, and it is

19:11.818 --> 19:14.352
it is beautiful, and it is
the reason that close-up magic,

19:14.354 --> 19:16.354
the reason that close-up magic,
to me, is so much more

19:16.356 --> 19:18.723
to me, is so much more
interesting than stage magic.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.891
Interesting than stage magic.
I will tell you a few things

19:19.893 --> 19:20.825
I will tell you a few things
that are great.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.494
That are great.
The stab through the card

19:23.496 --> 19:25.196
the stab through the card
is absolutely legit.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.164
Is absolutely legit.
That card is there

19:26.166 --> 19:26.797
that card is there
from the beginning.

19:26.799 --> 19:27.465
From the beginning.
>> Yep.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.466
>> Yep.
>> I will tell you that

19:28.468 --> 19:30.635
>> I will tell you that
the force you did on Julia

19:30.637 --> 19:33.204
the force you did on Julia
is a--is a wonderful force,

19:33.206 --> 19:34.505
is a--is a wonderful force,
and your handling of Julia

19:34.507 --> 19:35.673
and your handling of Julia
was really beautiful.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.208
Was really beautiful.
She had no sense.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.509
She had no sense.
You didn't--you didn't bully

19:38.511 --> 19:40.311
you didn't--you didn't bully
her; You didn't push her.

19:40.313 --> 19:40.778
Her; You didn't push her.
It was beautiful.

19:40.780 --> 19:41.612
It was beautiful.
>> Can I just--'cause I know

19:41.614 --> 19:42.547
>> can I just--'cause I know
you don't want to give too much

19:42.548 --> 19:43.481
you don't want to give too much
away with the jargon, but when

19:43.483 --> 19:44.482
away with the jargon, but when
you say he's just "handled"

19:44.484 --> 19:45.783
you say he's just "handled"
Julia, the rest of us...

19:45.785 --> 19:47.451
Julia, the rest of us...
[Laughter]

19:47.453 --> 19:48.452
[Laughter]
We'd love that to be just

19:48.454 --> 19:49.620
we'd love that to be just
expanded on a bit, just so

19:49.622 --> 19:51.322
expanded on a bit, just so
she doesn't try and sue us

19:51.324 --> 19:51.956
she doesn't try and sue us
afterwards.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.391
Afterwards.
I mean, you didn't feel handled

19:53.393 --> 19:54.225
I mean, you didn't feel handled
in any way, did you?

19:54.227 --> 19:54.692
In any way, did you?
>> No, no.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.359
>> No, no.
>> Yeah. Right.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.361
>> Yeah. Right.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.829
>> now, on Jonathan,
that was a fabulous trick,

19:58.831 --> 20:00.531
that was a fabulous trick,
and I'm gonna have to ask you

20:00.533 --> 20:03.668
and I'm gonna have to ask you
honestly--there were other ways

20:03.670 --> 20:04.835
honestly--there were other ways
that Jonathan thing could have

20:04.837 --> 20:07.538
that Jonathan thing could have
gone, and things went very well

20:07.540 --> 20:08.206
gone, and things went very well
for you.

20:08.208 --> 20:08.940
For you.
Is that correct?

20:08.942 --> 20:10.474
Is that correct?
>> You could say that, yeah.

20:10.476 --> 20:11.342
>> You could say that, yeah.
>> Yeah.

>> yeah, things went very,
very well for you.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.714
Very well for you.
So what we've got is two

20:16.716 --> 20:19.250
so what we've got is two
tremendous card forces,

20:19.252 --> 20:20.718
tremendous card forces,
and doing that face up

20:20.720 --> 20:22.253
and doing that face up
is really astonishing

20:22.255 --> 20:22.920
is really astonishing
and really great...

20:22.922 --> 20:23.588
And really great...
>> And hang on--

20:23.590 --> 20:24.455
>> and hang on--
>> and your handling

20:24.457 --> 20:25.389
>> and your handling
of all the people as well.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.324
Of all the people as well.
>> There were three of us

20:26.325 --> 20:27.258
>> there were three of us
in this marriage, and one of us

20:27.260 --> 20:28.259
in this marriage, and one of us
doesn't know what's happened

20:28.261 --> 20:28.893
doesn't know what's happened
there, so...

20:28.895 --> 20:29.560
There, so...
>> Okay.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.395
>> Okay.
[Laughter]

20:31.397 --> 20:33.431
[Laughter]
>> I--so I was part of this

20:33.433 --> 20:33.898
>> I--so I was part of this
in some way?

20:33.900 --> 20:34.699
In some way?
>> Well, no, you were part

20:34.700 --> 20:35.499
>> well, no, you were part
of this.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.335
Of this.
You were part of this in that

20:37.337 --> 20:39.503
you were part of this in that
there's this wonderful thing

20:39.505 --> 20:40.972
there's this wonderful thing
called "multiple outs,"

20:40.974 --> 20:42.473
called "multiple outs,"
that if he were to do this trick

20:42.475 --> 20:44.642
that if he were to do this trick
five more times in different

20:44.644 --> 20:46.344
five more times in different
rooms with different people,

20:46.346 --> 20:47.645
rooms with different people,
it would probably be

20:47.647 --> 20:48.779
it would probably be
a little bit different.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.782
A little bit different.
All he had to do was finesse

20:51.784 --> 20:54.018
all he had to do was finesse
you, and you played right into

20:54.020 --> 20:54.852
you, and you played right into
his hands.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.688
His hands.
You are the perfect patsy.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.556
You are the perfect patsy.

[Laughter]
But he's 25.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.693
But he's 25.
He's only just started shaving.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.861
He's only just started shaving.
How did he get the better of--

21:03.863 --> 21:04.862
how did he get the better of--
[Laughter]

21:04.864 --> 21:05.863
[Laughter]
Are you happy to accept

We've got more to come.
It's time now to meet our

21:58.384 --> 22:00.384
it's time now to meet our
next performer.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.058
>> Hi.
My name is David masters,

22:07.060 --> 22:08.092
my name is David masters,
and I'm an illusionist

22:08.094 --> 22:10.761
and I'm an illusionist
from Kent.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.763
From Kent.
After watching the first show,

22:12.765 --> 22:14.065
after watching the first show,
it really inspired me to go

22:14.067 --> 22:16.100
it really inspired me to go
and think of something original

22:16.102 --> 22:18.803
and think of something original
that I could bring to the stage.

22:18.805 --> 22:19.804
That I could bring to the stage.
I went right away back to

22:19.806 --> 22:21.806
I went right away back to
the drawing board, watched

22:21.808 --> 22:23.741
the drawing board, watched
every illusionist I could,

22:23.743 --> 22:25.009
every illusionist I could,
just to try and find that

22:25.011 --> 22:26.877
just to try and find that
original angle and original

22:26.879 --> 22:28.713
original angle and original
effect that I could create

22:28.715 --> 22:32.383
effect that I could create
that nobody had seen before.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.384
That nobody had seen before.
I've been working on this

22:33.386 --> 22:35.720
I've been working on this
illusion over the five or six

22:35.722 --> 22:37.855
illusion over the five or six
months--many sleepless nights.

22:37.857 --> 22:38.556
Months--many sleepless nights.
I can't even remember

22:38.558 --> 22:39.824
I can't even remember
what sleep is.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.125
What sleep is.
I just hope it's worth it

22:41.127 --> 22:43.127
I just hope it's worth it
on the night.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.662
On the night.
I would say there is an element

22:44.664 --> 22:45.830
I would say there is an element
of danger to the illusion.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.665
Of danger to the illusion.
There's chains, spikes,

22:47.667 --> 22:49.967
there's chains, spikes,
even flames--fire.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.102
Even flames--fire.
If just one of those things

22:51.104 --> 22:52.470
if just one of those things
goes wrong, I could be

22:52.472 --> 22:55.106
goes wrong, I could be
in trouble.

22:55.108 --> 22:56.140
In trouble.
Do I think I could fool

22:56.142 --> 22:57.641
do I think I could fool
penn and teller?

22:57.643 --> 22:58.642
Penn and teller?
I wouldn't be here

22:58.644 --> 22:59.110
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't think

22:59.112 --> 23:00.745
if I didn't think
I could fool penn and teller.

23:00.747 --> 23:04.148
I could fool penn and teller.

Thank you.

23:19.766 --> 23:20.598
Thank you.
I've got a slight inner thigh

23:20.600 --> 23:21.766
I've got a slight inner thigh
strain, but apart from that,

23:21.768 --> 23:22.600
strain, but apart from that,
everything's fine.

23:22.602 --> 23:23.434
Everything's fine.
>> That's good.

23:23.436 --> 23:24.435
>> That's good.
Before we actually get started,

23:24.437 --> 23:25.069

can I invite penn and teller

23:25.071 --> 23:26.437

What's gonna happen

23:36.649 --> 23:38.149
what's gonna happen
in just a moment is, I will

23:38.151 --> 23:40.651
in just a moment is, I will
get inside this metal box.

23:40.653 --> 23:43.487
Get inside this metal box.
The box will be lifted up

23:43.489 --> 23:44.822
the box will be lifted up
into the air, whilst I'm

23:44.824 --> 23:46.123
into the air, whilst I'm
shackled inside.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.158
Shackled inside.
I will be shackled

23:47.160 --> 23:48.826
I will be shackled
from my wrists.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.127
From my wrists.
Those shackles will have chains

23:50.129 --> 23:51.829
those shackles will have chains
going from my wrists, through

23:51.831 --> 23:53.497
going from my wrists, through
the sides of the box, to be

23:53.499 --> 23:55.032
the sides of the box, to be
controlled by both you, penn,

23:55.034 --> 23:56.167

>> If the trick is how the box

24:00.440 --> 24:02.440
>> if the trick is how the box
raises, they can see the chains.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.442
Raises, they can see the chains.
[Laughter]

24:04.444 --> 24:05.075
[Laughter]
>> I knew I should have

24:05.077 --> 24:06.444
>> I knew I should have
painted them black, right?

24:06.446 --> 24:07.111
Painted them black, right?
Okay.

24:07.113 --> 24:07.778
Okay.

you're gonna be in charge
of this chain.

24:10.850 --> 24:11.682
Of this chain.
Jonathan, can I just move you

24:11.684 --> 24:13.184
Jonathan, can I just move you
over here, a bit further back?

24:13.186 --> 24:14.518
Over here, a bit further back?
Now, Jonathan, can I ask you

24:14.520 --> 24:15.519

to please take a seat?

24:15.521 --> 24:16.654
To please take a seat?

26:35.327 --> 26:37.361
David masters,
ladies and gentlemen.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.330
Ladies and gentlemen.
What a spectacular illusion.

26:39.332 --> 26:41.031
What a spectacular illusion.
David, that was great.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.032
David, that was great.
I particularly liked the bit

26:42.034 --> 26:42.866
I particularly liked the bit
that, you're up there

26:42.868 --> 26:43.334
that, you're up there
in the box...

26:43.336 --> 26:44.201
In the box...
>> Yeah.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.086
>> Yeah.
>> Or at least, that's what

26:45.087 --> 26:45.970
>> or at least, that's what
I imagine, and then they come

26:45.972 --> 26:47.137
I imagine, and then they come
out, and they set the spikes--

26:47.139 --> 26:49.173
out, and they set the spikes--
which are bad enough--on fire.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.007
Which are bad enough--on fire.
I figure, if you're gonna

26:50.009 --> 26:50.841
I figure, if you're gonna
land on it, it'd be bad enough

26:50.843 --> 26:51.842
land on it, it'd be bad enough
you're sitting on a spike,

26:51.844 --> 26:53.177
you're sitting on a spike,
and it's burning as well.

26:53.179 --> 26:53.844
And it's burning as well.
I mean, it's, like,

26:53.846 --> 26:54.311
I mean, it's, like,
just added torment.

26:54.313 --> 26:55.312
Just added torment.
>> It gets pretty warm in there.

26:55.314 --> 26:56.347
>> It gets pretty warm in there.
It does get pretty warm.

26:56.349 --> 26:58.248
It does get pretty warm.
>> It's a tricky routine,

26:58.250 --> 26:58.916
>> it's a tricky routine,
I'm sure.

26:58.918 --> 26:59.783
I'm sure.
I mean, it looks spectacular.

26:59.785 --> 27:00.484
I mean, it looks spectacular.
We loved--I loved all the

27:00.485 --> 27:01.184
we loved--I loved all the
dressing around it.

27:01.187 --> 27:01.752
Dressing around it.
I loved the music there.

27:01.753 --> 27:02.318
I loved the music there.
Well, presumably,

27:02.321 --> 27:03.320
well, presumably,
this doesn't go wrong.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.289
This doesn't go wrong.
This--is it safe,

27:05.291 --> 27:06.323
this--is it safe,
100% safe for you?

27:06.325 --> 27:08.058
100% safe for you?
>> It's not 100% safe.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.059
>> It's not 100% safe.
Things can go wrong.

27:09.061 --> 27:09.893
Things can go wrong.
We had a bit of a close call

27:09.895 --> 27:13.063
we had a bit of a close call
in rehearsals, but luckily,

27:13.065 --> 27:14.064
in rehearsals, but luckily,
I'm unscathed this time.

27:14.066 --> 27:14.898
I'm unscathed this time.
>> You're all in one piece.

27:14.900 --> 27:15.833
>> You're all in one piece.
>> Just about.

27:15.835 --> 27:16.667
>> Just about.
>> It's a good sign,

27:16.669 --> 27:17.301
>> it's a good sign,
ladies and gentlemen,

27:17.303 --> 27:18.669
ladies and gentlemen,
that teller is scribbling away,

27:18.671 --> 27:19.837
that teller is scribbling away,
because normally, if they

27:19.839 --> 27:21.005
because normally, if they
know it, they chat a little bit;

27:21.007 --> 27:22.006
know it, they chat a little bit;
I get the feeling that they're--

27:22.008 --> 27:23.307
I get the feeling that they're--
if teller gets his notebook out,

27:23.309 --> 27:24.341
if teller gets his notebook out,
normally it means

27:24.343 --> 27:26.010
normally it means
they're guessing, okay?

27:26.012 --> 27:26.910
They're guessing, okay?
That's what it normally means.

27:26.912 --> 27:27.711
That's what it normally means.
>> That's what I'm hoping.

27:27.713 --> 27:28.379
>> That's what I'm hoping.
>> Let's find out.

27:28.381 --> 27:29.046
>> Let's find out.
Am I right?

27:29.048 --> 27:29.713
Am I right?
Are you guessing,

27:29.715 --> 27:30.381
are you guessing,
or do you know?

27:30.383 --> 27:31.215
Or do you know?
>> [Stammering]

27:31.217 --> 27:32.049
>> [Stammering]
We're guessing a little bit,

27:32.051 --> 27:33.384
we're guessing a little bit,
but I want to say, first of all,

27:33.386 --> 27:36.353
but I want to say, first of all,
we live in Las Vegas, Nevada,

27:36.355 --> 27:38.789
we live in Las Vegas, Nevada,
so you know that's a really bad

27:38.791 --> 27:40.791
so you know that's a really bad
sign for you, 'cause you know

27:40.793 --> 27:43.127
sign for you, 'cause you know
that we know that when someone

27:43.129 --> 27:45.295
that we know that when someone
puts a mask on or has someone

27:45.297 --> 27:46.430
puts a mask on or has someone
with a mask onstage...

27:46.432 --> 27:47.297
With a mask onstage...
>> Yeah.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.099
>> Yeah.
>> Or a motorcycle helmet

27:49.101 --> 27:51.268
>> or a motorcycle helmet
or a full-size chicken suit

27:51.270 --> 27:53.270
or a full-size chicken suit
or Elvis sideburns,

27:53.272 --> 27:54.772
or Elvis sideburns,
that, at some point,

27:54.774 --> 27:56.106
that, at some point,
there's gonna be a switch.

27:56.108 --> 27:56.774
There's gonna be a switch.
>> Yeah.

27:56.776 --> 27:57.841
>> Yeah.
>> So we were ready for you

27:57.843 --> 28:00.010
>> so we were ready for you
to do it, so we could watch you

28:00.012 --> 28:01.178
to do it, so we could watch you
do it.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.312
Do it.
Teller will also whisper

28:02.314 --> 28:04.348
teller will also whisper
a little something to you about

28:04.350 --> 28:06.350
a little something to you about
the way you got out of there

28:06.352 --> 28:08.352
the way you got out of there
to get offstage, and I think--

28:08.354 --> 28:10.187
to get offstage, and I think--
I think we probably have--

28:10.189 --> 28:11.689
I think we probably have--
I think we'll probably have

28:11.691 --> 28:13.190
I think we'll probably have
a pretty good idea, but I'll

28:13.192 --> 28:14.858
a pretty good idea, but I'll
let you two confer while I go

28:14.860 --> 28:17.327
let you two confer while I go
over here and talk to Jonathan.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.362
Over here and talk to Jonathan.
>> Are you confident that

28:18.364 --> 28:19.196
>> are you confident that
teller's got it?

28:19.198 --> 28:19.863
Teller's got it?
>> I don't know.

28:19.865 --> 28:20.330
>> I don't know.
We'll have to see.

28:20.332 --> 28:21.365
We'll have to see.
>> Did teller get it,

28:21.367 --> 28:22.032
>> did teller get it,
or did you get it?

28:22.034 --> 28:23.434
Or did you get it?
>> Actually I think we--

28:23.436 --> 28:24.435
>> actually I think we--
you know, we're from Vegas.

28:24.437 --> 28:25.302
You know, we're from Vegas.
>> You got it together.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.303
>> You got it together.
>> So this is the kind of act

28:26.305 --> 28:27.438
>> so this is the kind of act
that's done--actually over

28:27.440 --> 28:29.440
that's done--actually over
the strip in Vegas, it was done

28:29.442 --> 28:31.308
the strip in Vegas, it was done
very unsuccessfully by

28:31.310 --> 28:32.142
very unsuccessfully by
a magician a little while--

28:32.144 --> 28:32.810
a magician a little while--
>> oh, really?

28:32.812 --> 28:33.477
>> Oh, really?
>> Yeah.

28:33.479 --> 28:34.228
>> Yeah.
>> So this is being done better

28:34.229 --> 28:34.978
>> so this is being done better
here, then?

28:34.980 --> 28:35.813
Here, then?
>> Well, it's being done much

28:35.815 --> 28:36.480
>> well, it's being done much
better here, much better here.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.015
Better here, much better here.
>> So David would be--he'd be--

28:38.017 --> 28:39.016

28:39.018 --> 28:39.483
He's good enough to play Vegas.
>> Oh, of course.

28:39.485 --> 28:40.484
>> Oh, of course.
There's no doubt about it.

28:40.486 --> 28:41.452
There's no doubt about it.
>> Whether or not he'll get

28:41.453 --> 28:42.419
>> whether or not he'll get
there on his own steam

28:42.420 --> 28:43.386

Or via you, we'll find out now.
Okay, so, David, teller's

28:45.758 --> 28:46.390

whispering--number one:

28:46.392 --> 28:47.925
Whispering--number one:
Is his voice as deep and manly

28:47.927 --> 28:48.926
is his voice as deep and manly
as people say it is?

28:48.928 --> 28:49.927
As people say it is?
>> It is very low.

28:49.929 --> 28:50.394
>> It is very low.
>> Surprisingly.

28:51.263 --> 28:51.929
>> Deeper than penn's.
>> Surprisingly.

28:51.931 --> 28:52.596

It vibrates in your ear,

28:52.597 --> 28:53.262

doesn't it?

28:53.265 --> 28:54.264
Doesn't it?
>> It was, yes, good.

28:54.265 --> 28:55.264

or did you fool them?

28:57.269 --> 28:58.335
Or did you fool them?
>> They have got me on this one.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.284
but not one of them managed to
fool penn and teller.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.285
Fool penn and teller.
And that's no reflection on

29:48.287 --> 29:49.219
and that's no reflection on
them, because they were

29:49.221 --> 29:49.887

Terrific.

I specialize in modern

30:24.290 --> 30:26.056

stage magic--you know, something

30:26.058 --> 30:27.224
stage magic--you know, something
different, something new,

30:27.226 --> 30:28.225
different, something new,
something unique.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.860
Something unique.
I like to surprise people.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.361
I like to surprise people.
Have you ever seen a miracle?

30:31.363 --> 30:32.996
Have you ever seen a miracle?
I love the fact that in stage

30:32.998 --> 30:35.332
I love the fact that in stage
magic, you can combine tricks

30:35.334 --> 30:38.335
magic, you can combine tricks
with theater arts.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.303
With theater arts.
Every time I go onstage

30:39.305 --> 30:40.304
every time I go onstage

and they say, "welcome

and they say, "welcome
the current world champion

30:43.008 --> 30:44.308
the current world champion
of magic," there is a pressure.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.843
Of magic," there is a pressure.
You know, I have to live up

30:45.845 --> 30:47.311
you know, I have to live up
to the expectations,

30:47.313 --> 30:49.346
to the expectations,
which isn't easy.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.314
Which isn't easy.
I think pressure is necessary

30:50.316 --> 30:52.015
I think pressure is necessary
at every show.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.350
At every show.
A little stage fright

30:53.352 --> 30:54.318
a little stage fright
always helps.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.452
Always helps.
The bigger the pressure,

30:55.454 --> 30:57.454
the bigger the pressure,
the bigger the payoff can be.

30:57.456 --> 30:58.989
The bigger the payoff can be.
