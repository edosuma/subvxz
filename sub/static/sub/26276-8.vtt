Bobby to the hospital

22:55.112 --> 22:56.897
so he can save
his brother.
Huh.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.726
Getting one person to save
another sounds kind of familiar.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.771
A little bit like Brooks.

23:01.815 --> 23:03.033
I know.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.905
You know,
I still think about him.

23:04.948 --> 23:08.212
Me, too. Been replaying that day
in my head.

23:08.256 --> 23:10.563
[muffled sounds

Hurry up, boys.
We're under attack.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.754
Come on, Doc.
Follow us.

23:27.797 --> 23:29.408

23:46.816 --> 23:49.123

23:49.166 --> 23:51.778
I got you covered.
Come on.

23:51.821 --> 23:53.388
Get him up.Gonna get you out of here.

TC, let's move!

23:59.916 --> 24:01.048
Let's go!

24:01.091 --> 24:02.092
Let's go!

24:02.136 --> 24:03.746
Rick, keep laying fire.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.579
[groaning]

24:10.623 --> 24:12.625
You'll be all right.

24:16.542 --> 24:19.458
We did everything
we could, you know?

24:20.546 --> 24:22.069
Did we?

24:22.112 --> 24:24.419
Come on. Devon's flight
is starting to board.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.161
This is Devon.

24:27.204 --> 24:29.119
Go check with the guy
at the gate.

24:29.163 --> 24:30.730
I'm gonna look around.

24:38.912 --> 24:40.304
[sighs]

24:40.348 --> 24:42.263
[phone ringing]

24:42.306 --> 24:44.221
Hey, Bobby, you see him?

24:45.745 --> 24:47.398
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.400
Bobby can't come to
the phone right now.

24:49.444 --> 24:50.837
He's got a gun on him.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.708
But he just told us everything.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.449
I mean, that's just so sad.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.931
That thing with his brother
just tugs at the heart strings.

24:57.974 --> 25:00.281
You wouldn't have bothered to
call if you were gonna hurt him,

25:00.324 --> 25:01.848
so let's talk
about what you want.

25:01.891 --> 25:03.545
You're pretty direct,
aren't you?

25:03.589 --> 25:06.113
All right, Mr. P.I.,
this is how it's gonna go down.

25:06.156 --> 25:08.115
We're your new clients now.

25:08.158 --> 25:10.204
You want Bobby
and his bone marrow?

25:10.247 --> 25:12.772
You're gonna find his partner
and our money.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.251
Every last dollar.

25:14.295 --> 25:15.731
You're gonna deliver
both to us.

25:15.775 --> 25:18.081
I'll hit you back in two hours
and let you know where.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.779
Two hours is not enough time.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.572
Okay, so we know Devon
didn't show for his flight,

25:30.616 --> 25:32.139
so I called up
my guy at HPD.

25:32.182 --> 25:34.489
Their plate readers picked up
his car about an hour ago.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.099
Where?
Headed south
on Waialua Ranch Road.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.058
You sure?
Yeah. Why?

25:38.101 --> 25:39.755
I surf that break
all the time.

25:39.799 --> 25:42.105
Waialua Ranch Road
dead-ends into nothing.

25:48.198 --> 25:51.288
[metal detector whining]

25:51.332 --> 25:52.855
This is hopeless.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.901
Have faith, Ms. H.

25:54.944 --> 25:57.599
If that necklace of yours
is somewhere in the sand,

25:57.643 --> 25:59.209
this baby will find it.

25:59.253 --> 26:02.473
Mr. Robin Masters paid a lot
of money for this little toy.

26:02.517 --> 26:04.345
Do you even know how
to use that device?

26:04.388 --> 26:07.217
I think so.
I watched a video on YouTube.

26:07.261 --> 26:09.306
[phone ringing]

26:09.350 --> 26:11.178
Look who it is.

26:11.221 --> 26:14.398
Higgins, I need another
advance on that favor.

26:14.442 --> 26:15.748
Uh, "advance" implies
future payment.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.532
And as Kumu and I
are currently the only ones

26:17.576 --> 26:18.577
looking for my necklace...

26:18.620 --> 26:19.882
No, you don't have to do that.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.623
I said I'm gonna find it.
I'm gonna find it.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.059
But right now I need help.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.495
What is it?

26:24.539 --> 26:27.498
I'm looking for a car.
A rust-color 1960s Plymouth.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.326
Last seen in a remote part
of Waialua.

26:29.370 --> 26:30.545
Can you get some
satellite coverage,

26:30.589 --> 26:31.894
see if you can spot it?

26:31.938 --> 26:33.679
That's no small favor, Magnum.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.637
Normally I wouldn't ask,
but there are literally

26:35.681 --> 26:38.466
two people's lives on the line.

26:38.509 --> 26:39.902
[engine revs]

26:39.946 --> 26:41.425
MAGNUM: Higgins was able
to mark Devon's car

26:41.469 --> 26:43.210
and drop a pin for us
to follow,

26:43.253 --> 26:46.430
but Rick was right:
the road did lead to nowhere.

26:46.474 --> 26:47.867
Which begs the question:

26:47.910 --> 26:50.609
what was Devon doing out here?

26:52.436 --> 26:53.786
Looks abandoned.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.229
Check the trunk.

27:02.272 --> 27:03.491
Yeah.

27:09.976 --> 27:12.195
Uh, Thomas?

27:12.239 --> 27:13.240
Got something?

27:13.283 --> 27:15.895
Yeah, you could say that.

27:21.204 --> 27:23.206
RICK: That's Devon, right?MAGNUM: Yeah.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.343
Rigor hasn't set in.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.780
He was probably killed
in the last few hours.Yeah.

27:31.824 --> 27:34.348
Looks like someone
tuned him up pretty good first.

27:37.307 --> 27:38.874
You think he was double-crossed
by someone

27:38.918 --> 27:41.224
he came out here to meet?I don't think so.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.139
He wouldn't drive out here
without shoes.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.488
Plus, this looks like
an area rug.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.273
I think he was killed
inside his apartment.

27:46.316 --> 27:49.189
All right, I can see
those wheels turning.

27:49.232 --> 27:50.843
I don't think Devon
was running at all.

27:50.886 --> 27:53.715
I think the guy who killed him
wanted to make it look that way.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.325
Packed his bag full of clothes,

27:55.369 --> 27:56.849
bought a plane ticket
with his credit card,

27:56.892 --> 27:58.807
make it look like
he skipped town.

27:58.851 --> 28:01.636
But why? I mean, who would
go through all that trouble?

28:01.680 --> 28:02.985
Somebody who wanted the money

28:03.029 --> 28:04.421
and didn't want anybody
to find out.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.382
[phone ringing]

28:08.425 --> 28:09.905
It's a blocked number.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.081
Yeah?

28:12.125 --> 28:14.170
Find it yet?

28:14.214 --> 28:16.520
Yeah, yeah.
I got your money.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.218
All of it?

28:18.261 --> 28:19.915
$104,000.
Where do you want it?

28:19.959 --> 28:22.570
I'm texting the address
right now.

28:25.312 --> 28:27.967
If you're not there
in 30 minutes, well,

28:28.010 --> 28:30.447
good luck finding
another bone marrow donor.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.275
Also, I think it goes
without saying...

28:32.319 --> 28:34.321
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Come alone.

28:34.364 --> 28:37.063
I get the feeling you've handled
these kind of trades before.

28:37.106 --> 28:38.368
I have some experience.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.240
Look, I'll be there in 30,
but just make sure

28:40.283 --> 28:42.198
you, your two boys and Bobby
are out in the open.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.460
I don't want to get
shot in the back.

28:43.504 --> 28:45.506
30 minutes.

28:45.549 --> 28:47.769
Obviously, you're not
going alone.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.379
Obviously.
When this thing goes south--

28:49.423 --> 28:51.338
and it definitely will
when they find out

28:51.381 --> 28:53.949
I don't have the money--
I'm gonna need some backup.

29:21.672 --> 29:24.066
That's close enough.

29:24.110 --> 29:25.241
How you doing, Bobby?

29:25.285 --> 29:27.853
He's alive.
Is that my money?

29:27.896 --> 29:29.942
It's all right here.

29:29.985 --> 29:32.118
I don't see the guy
who stole it.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.473
That's because he's dead.

29:39.516 --> 29:42.432
You're one badass
private eye.

29:42.476 --> 29:43.694
[chuckles]

29:43.738 --> 29:45.827
Drop the suitcase on
the ground, back away.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.698
Let me ask you
a question first.

29:47.742 --> 29:49.526
How'd you know we were
gonna be at the airport?

29:49.570 --> 29:51.702
You didn't have a tail.
I would have picked him up.

29:51.746 --> 29:53.313
So how'd you know
we were gonna be there?

29:53.356 --> 29:55.532
'Cause it wasn't you
we was looking for.

29:55.576 --> 29:58.013
We took another glance at
that surveillance tape.

29:58.057 --> 30:00.537
The guy who robbed the safe,
he walked with a limp.

30:00.581 --> 30:02.713
And I know everybody who's
ever worked at that store.

30:02.757 --> 30:04.846
Thought maybe it was
that guy Devon.

30:04.890 --> 30:06.543
So we went to his place,

30:06.587 --> 30:07.675
found a plane ticket.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.372
Now, give me my money.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.548
But you all didn't go together.

30:11.592 --> 30:13.724
Two of you went
to Bobby's ex's.

30:13.768 --> 30:14.943
Which one of you went
to Devon's?

30:14.987 --> 30:16.510
What does it matter?This is crazy, Manny.

30:16.553 --> 30:17.511
The guy's stalling.

30:17.554 --> 30:20.427
It was him, wasn't it?

30:21.471 --> 30:22.733
You sent him to Devon's.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.344
What the hell's that got to do
with anything?

30:24.387 --> 30:25.606
MAN: He's trying
to pull something.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.434
He either has the cash
or he don't.

30:27.477 --> 30:30.045
No, he's right.

30:30.089 --> 30:31.699
I don't have the cash.

30:34.397 --> 30:35.485
But I know who does.

30:35.529 --> 30:36.878
Let's smoke this guy.

30:36.922 --> 30:39.315
No, just-just hear me out.
You'll be glad you did.

30:39.359 --> 30:40.316
Talk fast.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.448
Okay.

30:41.491 --> 30:42.971
You sent him to check
on Devon, right?

30:43.015 --> 30:45.582
But he saw an opportunity
to enrich himself.

30:45.626 --> 30:46.757
So he killed Devon,

30:46.801 --> 30:48.542
made it look like
he went on the run,

30:48.585 --> 30:50.065
and took the money for himself.

30:53.677 --> 30:55.418
Just look at the location

He went to
Waialua Ranch Road

30:57.507 --> 30:59.945
right after he killed Devon
and dropped his car off.
