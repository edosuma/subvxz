We are not talking about sex

I agree.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.633
Last year, I interviewed Nomi
in an article for Vogue,

01:39.667 --> 01:41.235

confirmation surgery

01:43.504 --> 01:45.306
and how it affected

How do you think
the conversation around sex

01:46.874 --> 01:48.609
within the trans

01:48.642 --> 01:50.478

01:55.549 --> 01:57.485
At the same time,
in Hollywood,

01:57.518 --> 02:00.621
they have been exploiting
the trans narrative.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.323
When people think of
Laverne Cox

02:04.592 --> 02:07.228
"Stop talking about surgery,
stop talking about sex,"

02:07.261 --> 02:09.263
did you agree
with them to a degree?

02:09.297 --> 02:13.234
Your private parts
are different now, aren't they?

02:13.267 --> 02:16.770
I don't want to talk about it
because it's really personal.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.739
The preoccupation with
transition, with surgery,

02:18.772 --> 02:20.341
objectifies trans people,

02:20.374 --> 02:21.909
and then we don't get
to really deal

02:21.942 --> 02:23.611
with the real
lived experiences,

02:23.644 --> 02:26.647
the reality of trans
people's lives.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.183
I feel that, you know,
my community has done a lot

02:29.217 --> 02:31.219
to create boundaries
with society

02:31.252 --> 02:33.521
that let people know they don't
have access to our bodies

02:33.554 --> 02:35.889
and that we are entitled
to our privacy,

02:35.923 --> 02:37.825
and we shouldn't
be objectified.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.927
If you wouldn't ask
that to, like...

02:39.960 --> 02:41.729
-Tom Cruise.
-...Nicole Kidman, yeah,

02:41.762 --> 02:46.934
then why would you feel like you
have access to that information?

02:46.967 --> 02:49.370
But, at the same time,
I feel like those boundaries

02:49.403 --> 02:52.806
have made it a little difficult
to talk about sex and sexuality.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.375
Not talking about
something sometimes

02:54.408 --> 02:58.246
makes it feel shameful,
and it isn't.

And so, somehow, we have to,
like, break the barrier

and place to talk about sex.

We do receive that

My surgeon was able to reduce
the size of my breast tissue,

08:01.014 --> 08:04.785

actually kept the blood supply

08:04.818 --> 08:07.955
and the nerve ending
attached to the nipples,

08:07.988 --> 08:10.057
and then made them
more cis-looking,

08:41.054 --> 08:44.892
but I say, overall,
I identify as trans queer

because I still want to honor
my queer experience of,

08:49.296 --> 08:54.267

the fluidity of people's
gender expression

about 7 months ago.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.839
Everybody just thinks like,
"Oh, a penis or, like,

a clitoris are not the same,"
but they're very similar.

09:34.775 --> 09:38.912
And so they just, like, reshape
it and, like, reposition, right?

09:38.946 --> 09:41.214
There's a very physical process
that you have to go

09:41.248 --> 09:43.283
through in recovery
to surgery, right?

09:43.316 --> 09:45.953
Mm-hmm.
There's a muscle in that area.

09:45.986 --> 09:49.056
That muscle is not used
to having a cavity,

09:49.089 --> 09:52.626
so if you don't
keep it open, it'll close.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.127
So it's really
important to dilate.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.929
You have to dilate
every day.

09:55.963 --> 09:59.132
Can you explain
what dilation is?

09:59.166 --> 10:05.105
So you pretty much get this
silicone rod dildo-type thing.

10:05.138 --> 10:08.275
It's not as erotic
as it sounds.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.376
It's just really hard.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.744
Do you want to see them?

10:10.778 --> 10:11.979
Yeah.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.714
It's made perfectly
to fit,

10:13.747 --> 10:17.117
and it has little dots
to indicate the size.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.119
They're a little thicker
at the ends,

10:19.152 --> 10:21.354
but they're
all the same length.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.991
I started with this one.
This is the one I learned with.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.426
My depth
is about right here.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.763
And then this one, I'm terrified
of just because it...

10:29.797 --> 10:31.899
I mean, it's not that thick,
but it looks...

10:31.932 --> 10:33.033
Yeah,
I'd be scared of that.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.702
It looks big.
It's painful.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.403
It's really painful,
and your nerves,

10:36.436 --> 10:39.339
they become numb
from kind of the trauma

10:39.372 --> 10:41.809
they go through,
and they start coming back,

10:41.842 --> 10:44.144
and it hurts like hell.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.913
There's depression too.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.981
I'm still depressed,
I feel,

10:48.015 --> 10:49.449
and I didn't think
I would be depressed.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.219
You would think that
I'd be really happy, and...

10:52.252 --> 10:54.922
What do you think
the depression is from?

10:54.955 --> 10:58.892
As a trans woman, I guess
I have expectations for myself

10:58.926 --> 11:01.161
that I've created
since I was very little

11:01.194 --> 11:02.963
of what
I want to look like.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.700
I thought, "Once I get surgery,
I'll be happy,"

11:06.734 --> 11:08.201
but I'm still not.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.337
Do other people in the community
or other trans women

11:10.370 --> 11:12.773
who have gone through surgery
talk about something similar?

11:12.806 --> 11:16.343
So when I looked online to see
if it had the information

11:16.376 --> 11:18.245
regarding
post-op about sex,

11:18.278 --> 11:21.982
about post-op life,
it was really hard to find.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.353
There seemed to be kind of,
like, shame

11:26.386 --> 11:30.490
and kind of a stigma
to talk about it.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.359
It takes a lot
of courage for Aly

11:32.392 --> 11:35.996
to open up about how she's still
struggling after her surgery.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.497
It reminds me
of what Nomi said

11:37.530 --> 11:39.499
about going through
similar struggles.

11:39.532 --> 11:43.370
When I decided to have my
surgery, I just felt so isolated

11:43.403 --> 11:45.873
and so alone,
and I was, like, terrified.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.742
There was just so much
that I didn't expect, you know,

11:48.776 --> 11:51.411
and it's been
a learning process.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.481
Still, to this day, I'm learning
more and more and more.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.384
If we just talk about it more,
I think it doesn't have to be

11:57.417 --> 11:59.887
so isolating and so scary.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.323
What do you want to say to
young women of trans experience

12:03.356 --> 12:07.394
about sex
and about sexuality

12:07.427 --> 12:10.363
that you wish someone had
told you when you were younger?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.366
I feel like a lot of girls
going through this journey

12:13.400 --> 12:16.403
blame their body, or, like,
they blame their trans-ness.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.538
I remember there was this
one guy going down on me

12:18.571 --> 12:20.140
for, like, an hour,

12:20.173 --> 12:21.942
and I'm trying to get into it
because I'm like,

12:21.975 --> 12:23.811
"I have to enjoy this.
It would suck if I don't."

12:23.844 --> 12:27.414
And I'm like, "It's a disaster.
I can't focus. I'm in pain."

12:27.447 --> 12:29.049
I'm just like, "What is...
something..."

12:29.082 --> 12:30.884
And I would blame it
on myself.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.220
And I didn't even realize it was
just because the guy sucked.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.923
And then, like, when I kept,
you know, trying,

12:35.956 --> 12:37.290
and I met something
that was amazing,

12:37.324 --> 12:40.327
it was,
of course, heavenly.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.562
Oh, it's real.
It's so real.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.497
That's what I want to share
with other people.

12:44.531 --> 12:49.236
There is, like, a beautiful
light at the end of the tunnel.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.571
It's liberating to a woman
who has been forced

12:51.604 --> 12:53.306
to have this open mind
with sex

12:53.340 --> 12:56.109
and sexuality and gender
and the human body.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.310
It's sexy, you know.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.280
I think so.
I think so too.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.316
Sluts!
[ Laughs ]

13:03.350 --> 13:05.252
It was embarrassing to be
a man with a vagina.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.255
And there were my fingers,
inside of me,

13:08.288 --> 13:12.425
and I had the most
amazing orgasm of my life.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.499
Karley: Few people have
advocated for the importance

13:21.268 --> 13:22.870
of an open
conversation around sex

13:22.903 --> 13:25.305
in the trans community
more than Buck Angel.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.942
Buck is an LGBTQ activist,
a sex educator,

13:28.976 --> 13:31.611
a sex-toy inventor,
and a pornographer.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.480
Respect.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.548
Karley: Do you think that now
we're finally getting to a point

13:35.582 --> 13:37.350
where the idea
of transsexuality

13:37.384 --> 13:39.352
is something
that we can talk about,

13:39.386 --> 13:42.355
and people are
more accepting of?

13:42.389 --> 13:45.225
No. I don't think so.
[ Laughs ] No.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.160
I tend to be one of
the only people

13:47.194 --> 13:49.596
out there really pushing
for talking about,

13:49.629 --> 13:51.498
you know, sex within
the trans community,

13:51.531 --> 13:54.401
and I get a lot of pushback
from parts of this community,

13:54.434 --> 13:57.137
of the trans community, that I
don't speak for the community.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.506
I don't speak for
anybody but myself.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.109
Some of us choose to talk
about our genitals,

14:02.142 --> 14:03.443
and some of us don't.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.979
But I think, by not having
the conversation,

14:06.013 --> 14:09.516
we have shut down
our own needs

14:09.549 --> 14:14.354
and our own desires
and our own self-awareness.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.389
Buck also holds
workshops to promote

14:16.423 --> 14:18.658
an open conversation
around sex.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.160
And, tonight, he's invited me

14:20.193 --> 14:22.662
to join one of his
candid group hangs.

14:22.695 --> 14:26.233
I started my workshops because
I wanted to start to help guys

14:26.266 --> 14:27.600
to figure out
how to get to that

14:27.634 --> 14:30.403
next level of accepting
your body sexually

14:30.437 --> 14:33.640
and actually
engaging physically.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.442
Hi, everybody.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.044
Thanks for coming.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.511
It's so awesome that
you guys all showed up.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.147
[ Laughs ]

14:40.180 --> 14:44.151
Sex is an important part
of being a human being,

14:44.184 --> 14:47.154
and one of the things
that totally changed my life

14:47.187 --> 14:50.623
was learning how
to have sex in my body,

14:50.657 --> 14:54.061
which was the body
I hated most of my life.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.296
So I started to have
to think to myself,

14:56.329 --> 15:00.333
"Will I be a man
with my vagina?"

15:00.367 --> 15:02.435
because the world
says no.

15:02.469 --> 15:07.174
So this is exactly how
I decided not to get a penis --

15:07.207 --> 15:09.109
masturbation.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.411
One day, in my secret
little masturbation club

15:11.444 --> 15:13.480
that I would have at home
under my covers,

15:13.513 --> 15:15.315
I would jack off.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.151
And there I was,
jacking off all crazy,

15:18.185 --> 15:21.421
and then my fingers
slipped inside of me,

15:21.454 --> 15:23.423
and I had never been
penetrated before.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.524
Never wanted to.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.059
That felt very feminine
to me.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.727
It felt like it was
woman's stuff,

15:27.760 --> 15:29.462
and I'm not interested
in that.

15:29.496 --> 15:32.465
And there were my fingers,
inside of me,

15:32.499 --> 15:36.569
and I had the most
amazing orgasm of my life

15:36.603 --> 15:38.205
that I will never forget.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.140
That is definitely
when the clouds parted,

15:40.173 --> 15:41.641
and I was like,
"I saw God,"

15:41.674 --> 15:44.744
and I was like, "And why would
I get rid of my vagina?"

15:44.777 --> 15:47.981
Now, I don't want you to think
that my whole process in that

15:48.015 --> 15:50.717
is to discourage people from
having surgery because it isn't.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.053
My message
is to be yourself.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.187
If you want to have
bottom surgery, do it.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.089
If you don't, no.

15:56.123 --> 16:00.227
But the point is is that I live
an amazing life with a vagina.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.495
When I used to go
to trans support groups,

16:02.529 --> 16:05.265
the most important question
that the facilitator

16:05.298 --> 16:07.067
had said one day is like,

16:07.100 --> 16:08.468
"What you need
to ask yourself is,

16:08.501 --> 16:10.103
'When is it going
to be enough?'"
Right.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.338
"'When are you going to
be enough?'"
Right.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.772
Because, yeah,
it could be XYZ,

16:12.805 --> 16:14.607
and you're still not happy,
so...

16:14.641 --> 16:16.376
Happiness comes from inside.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.245
Exactly.
That's the key.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.646
It's so simple.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.548
Like, this is your journey.
Do it your way.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.251
Like, I'm not on testosterone,
and I'm comfortable with that,

16:24.284 --> 16:25.685
and guys ask me all the time,
"Yo, bro, like,

16:25.718 --> 16:27.254
how did you
get that beard?"

16:27.287 --> 16:28.455
And I'm like, "Oh, well,
I went another route,"

16:28.488 --> 16:29.756
because a lot of bros
don't know

16:29.789 --> 16:31.324
you can have beard
transplant surgery.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.593
There are options that
you can do for yourself.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.562
You don't have to compare
and contrast

16:35.595 --> 16:38.398
yourself to other people.
Every single one of us
in this room

16:38.431 --> 16:41.668
have been brainwashed to feel
gender is a certain way,

16:41.701 --> 16:43.370
"You don't have a penis,
you're not a man."

16:43.403 --> 16:45.072
That's controlling.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.574
With that said, a lot of
trans men are not at the level

16:47.607 --> 16:49.709
I'm at with my vagina.

16:49.742 --> 16:53.713
So what I said to myself was,
"How do I get trans men

16:53.746 --> 16:56.483
to feel comfortable
in their bodies?"

16:56.516 --> 16:59.386
So I kept thinking, "How can
I get them, how can I get them,"

16:59.419 --> 17:02.055
and I'm like, "A toy."

17:02.089 --> 17:05.592
This is the very first
transgender male sex toy

17:05.625 --> 17:07.160
in the world.

17:07.194 --> 17:10.563
So I designed it specifically
to have the look

17:10.597 --> 17:12.531
of a penis a little bit,
right?

17:12.565 --> 17:15.702
So this fits over top
of the clitoris like that,

17:15.734 --> 17:19.172
so now when you're masturbating,
what are you doing?

17:19.205 --> 17:20.406
You're jacking off.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.509
So instead of touching
your vagina,

17:22.541 --> 17:24.377
you're jacking off
like a guy.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.579
So that was an amazing thing,
to be able to create a product

17:27.614 --> 17:31.184
that gave men permission
to masturbate

17:31.218 --> 17:32.419
and gave men permission
to say,

17:32.452 --> 17:34.454
"My body is okay,
and I'm okay."

17:34.487 --> 17:36.723
So I have guys writing me
now and saying,

17:36.756 --> 17:40.793
"I don't even use it anymore.
I now touch myself."

17:40.827 --> 17:43.463
That, to me,
is everything.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.466
If you do not love your body and
you don't understand your body,

17:46.499 --> 17:50.503
however your body is,
nobody else will love your body.

17:50.537 --> 17:55.475
I equate a lot of myself
and my confidence to sex,

17:55.508 --> 17:57.144
and it's why I like
to talk about sex

17:57.177 --> 17:58.711
and why I think, within
the trans community,

17:58.745 --> 18:01.614
we better start
to talk about sex.

18:01.648 --> 18:05.118
[ Cheers and applause ]

18:05.152 --> 18:08.355
I thank you guys.
I appreciate it.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.190
Karley: Buck's talk was such
a great experience.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.559
It was really clear how
important his work is to people.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.427
I just think that
it's so healthy for people

18:14.461 --> 18:17.597
to talk about sex in, like,
such a raw and honest way, like,

18:17.630 --> 18:19.699
whether you're trans
or not trans.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.601
People are looking
for an opportunity

18:21.634 --> 18:24.371
to have that conversation,
and him being so open about it

18:24.404 --> 18:25.638
is really giving
people permission

18:25.672 --> 18:26.906
to start talking about that.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.342
What up, bro?
Nice to meet you finally.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.311
It's kind of been, like, taboo
to talk about sex

18:31.344 --> 18:32.845
within the trans community.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.714
So with Buck inviting
this conversation, it's like,

18:34.747 --> 18:36.483
"Wow. Okay.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.917
It is uncomfortable.
It's different.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.819
We're different,
but we're valued, we're human,

18:39.852 --> 18:42.189
and we deserve
the right to have sex."

18:42.222 --> 18:44.491
Sex is fun.
Yeah.
It's great. I love it.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.693
Aly: As a person,
I finally feel free.

18:46.726 --> 18:51.298
I feel liberated, but I don't
feel that way around sex.

18:54.534 --> 18:58.938
**

18:58.971 --> 19:00.707
Aly:
When it came to transitioning,

19:00.740 --> 19:04.344
I've never thought
about my sexuality.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.546
I've transitioned for myself.

19:09.416 --> 19:15.522
But being post-op, I want to
feel pleasure with my partner.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.290
Karley:
How would you say that the way
that you guys are intimate

19:17.324 --> 19:20.427
with each other
has changed as you've gone

19:20.460 --> 19:23.696
through these parts
of your transition together?

19:23.730 --> 19:25.332
As a person, I feel free.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.733
I finally free.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.569
I feel liberated,
but I don't feel that way

19:29.602 --> 19:31.404
around sex right now.

19:31.438 --> 19:35.308
Do you have goals
for your sex life?

19:35.342 --> 19:37.944
I have a goal I guess just to
be comfortable with my body

19:37.977 --> 19:42.982
so I could just be
as freaky as possible...
[ Laughs ]

19:43.015 --> 19:44.784
...without feeling
uncomfortable.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.420
You know, having penetrative
sex, that is a goal,

19:47.454 --> 19:48.988
I think, of ours.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.692
We're still so freshly,
you know, out of Aly's surgery

19:52.725 --> 19:54.594
that we're still
in a stage of her

19:54.627 --> 19:55.862
getting used to dilating,

19:55.895 --> 19:59.266
getting used to
having penetration.

19:59.299 --> 20:02.302
We understand that that's,
you know, going to take time,

20:02.335 --> 20:05.938
and I think it's just
being respectful of her

20:05.972 --> 20:07.874
and creating that
safe space for her

20:07.907 --> 20:10.377
to be more and more
comfortable it key.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.811
-So respectful.
-Like, literally.

20:11.844 --> 20:12.845
It's so funny.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.948
It's just it feels good.

20:15.982 --> 20:19.252
I think that dating a dude
who is really concerned

20:19.286 --> 20:20.587
with your sexual pleasure
is literally the

20:20.620 --> 20:23.856
Holy Grail for anyone.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.558
Yeah, definitely.

20:25.592 --> 20:30.497
**

20:30.530 --> 20:33.433
That's what I love
about being with Cameron.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.868
I understand him.
He understands me.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.605
And, you know,
we talk about sex.

20:38.638 --> 20:42.975
We have communication,
and I think it's very unique.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.645
I think, and I hope that,
as a culture,

20:45.678 --> 20:47.780
we are finally
beginning to understand

20:47.814 --> 20:49.949
or to expand the definition
of sex beyond just,

20:49.982 --> 20:51.584
like, this heteronormative
idea of,

20:51.618 --> 20:53.553
like, you go like this,
you know what I mean?

20:53.586 --> 20:54.954
-Right.
-Right.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.824
And that's true
for straight people, cis people,

20:57.857 --> 21:00.026
queer people, right?
-Yeah.

21:00.059 --> 21:03.363
People, whatever they are,
trans, cis,

21:03.396 --> 21:07.667
it's not just about parts
fitting together, absolutely.

21:07.700 --> 21:12.705
It's, you know, it also
takes place on a higher plane.

21:12.739 --> 21:15.074
No matter what your gender
or sexual orientation,

21:15.107 --> 21:18.445
engaging in open conversations
around sex and sexuality

21:18.478 --> 21:21.848
can be transformative
not only on a personal level

21:21.881 --> 21:24.717
but for society at large.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.320
Plus respectful
conversations around sex

21:27.354 --> 21:30.857
are just undeniably sexy.

21:30.890 --> 21:36.896
I'm hopeful that it'll get
better as the months go by.

21:36.929 --> 21:41.534
It's wonderful that I have
Cameron who is understanding.

21:41.568 --> 21:44.504
Learning how to please
the other partner

21:44.537 --> 21:46.973
is just kind of something
you're always learning

21:47.006 --> 21:49.809
and always constantly
evolving in a relationship.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.878
I don't think you ever stop
learning your partner

21:51.911 --> 21:54.381
no matter how long
you're together.

21:56.516 --> 21:59.118
I was able to experience,
you know, love and intimacy

21:59.151 --> 22:05.392
in giving Aly pleasure
before and after surgery.

22:05.425 --> 22:08.361
It's just reinforcing the fact
that it's about the person.

22:08.395 --> 22:12.131
It's not about
the plumbing.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.634
Sex is more
than just physical.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.136
It's also, like,
the spiritual connection.

22:17.169 --> 22:22.575

22:22.609 --> 22:27.814
