WEBVTT

00:05.917 --> 00:10.292
No! No, this report is
inappropriate.

00:10.375 --> 00:12.417
You'll have to do it again.

00:12.500 --> 00:13.583
But, Londo, why?

00:13.667 --> 00:16.125
I-I've spent weeks
working on this report.

00:16.208 --> 00:18.583
I didn't even sleep
on the flight back from Minbar

00:18.667 --> 00:19.958
so I could go over it again.

00:20.042 --> 00:22.750
I've checked
every single detail myself.

00:22.833 --> 00:24.125
It's absolutely accurate.

00:24.208 --> 00:26.167
Yes, Vir, I'm sure it is

00:26.250 --> 00:27.583
and that is the problem.

00:27.667 --> 00:30.167
Here, you say, the Minbari

00:30.250 --> 00:32.250
have carefully preserved
their cities

00:32.333 --> 00:33.542
over the course of centuries.

00:33.625 --> 00:34.917
- That's right, absolutely.
- No.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.833
What you should say instead is..

00:36.917 --> 00:39.000
Their cities are very old

00:39.083 --> 00:41.750
indicating a decaying culture.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.125
- What?
- And here..

00:43.208 --> 00:45.292
The Minbari put great emphasis

00:45.375 --> 00:48.875
on art, literature, and music.

00:48.958 --> 00:50.958
Yes, but-but say instead

00:51.042 --> 00:52.333
they are a decadent people.

00:52.417 --> 00:55.375
Interested only
in the pursuit of..

00:55.458 --> 00:57.000
...of dubious pleasures.

00:57.083 --> 00:58.792
The dubious part
is very important.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.208
It doesn't mean anything

01:00.292 --> 01:02.708
but it scares people
every time. Alright?

01:02.792 --> 01:05.208
L-Londo, every time I make

01:05.292 --> 01:07.208
a report, you do this to me.

01:07.292 --> 01:08.792
Yes, Vir,
I'm trying to help you.

01:08.875 --> 01:11.542
A report that will be circulated
at the royal court

01:11.625 --> 01:13.375
needs to be phrased carefully.

01:13.458 --> 01:16.875
To make sure they appear
less civilized than we are.

01:16.958 --> 01:18.292
Keeps the emperor happy.

01:18.375 --> 01:20.750
I thought the purpose
of filing these reports

01:20.833 --> 01:22.958
was to provide
accurate intelligence.

01:23.042 --> 01:26.167
Vir, intelligence has nothing
to do with politics.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.792
Here, "They're tolerant
of differences

01:28.875 --> 01:30.417
among other cultures."

01:30.500 --> 01:32.458
No, make that..

01:32.542 --> 01:35.417
They have no well-defined
sense of morality.

01:35.500 --> 01:36.958
They'll love that back home.

01:37.042 --> 01:39.333
Londo, that's it!

01:39.417 --> 01:41.917
I've been up for a day and
a half working on this report.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.292
want to make notes, fine.
You make notes.

01:45.375 --> 01:47.833
But you've had me locked in here
ever since I got back.

01:47.917 --> 01:50.333
Now I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna get some sleep.

01:50.417 --> 01:53.708
And then I'll come back and
we'll try to work this out.

01:53.792 --> 01:56.667
[automated voice]
'Ambassador Mollari, call
for you from Centauri Prime.'

01:56.750 --> 02:00.375
Send it through. I've been
waiting for this all day.

02:00.458 --> 02:03.375
[mumbling]
You've been waiting
for this all day.

02:03.458 --> 02:05.167
Ambassador Mollari

02:05.250 --> 02:06.958
I am to tell you
that Lady Morella

02:07.042 --> 02:10.792
has agreed to your request
and will be arriving shortly.

02:10.875 --> 02:13.417
She and her entourage
are willing to stop by

02:13.500 --> 02:16.208
'en route from a goodwill
visit to Brakesh 9.'

02:16.292 --> 02:18.250
Excellent! Just excellent!

02:18.333 --> 02:19.958
Thank you, Lord Trego.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.125
Lady Morella,
the Emperor Turhan's

02:23.208 --> 02:24.833
third wife is coming here?

02:24.917 --> 02:27.208
Yes. It will be
a most important visit

02:27.292 --> 02:28.750
in more ways
than you can imagine.

02:28.833 --> 02:30.208
But how did you..

02:30.292 --> 02:31.542
I told her that
I would wished to give her

02:31.625 --> 02:33.458
a tour of Babylon 5.

02:33.542 --> 02:35.542
To show her how
our new treaty with Earth

02:35.625 --> 02:38.167
will advance the cause
of all Centauri.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.042
- Oh..
- Things are going very well.

02:40.125 --> 02:41.458
Why not take advantage of it?

02:41.542 --> 02:45.125
Now, hurry.
We must prepare for her visit.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.583
From now on,
things must go smoothly.

02:49.083 --> 02:52.167
Great maker, now what?

02:52.250 --> 02:53.792
You!

02:53.875 --> 02:56.333
- What is going on?
- Haven't you heard?

02:56.417 --> 02:58.375
The Earth alliance
just declared martial law.

03:00.542 --> 03:02.250
(male #1)
Things are out of control
down here, captain.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.417
We don't know
what the hell's going on.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.417
What about the senate?
Can't they do something?

03:06.500 --> 03:09.125
Clark just issued an executive
order dissolving the senate.

03:09.208 --> 03:12.167
Half of them are on the run now,
a bunch more have been arrested.

03:12.250 --> 03:15.250
The rest are holed up in their
offices, refusing to leave.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.083
They're calling in
every favor they can

03:17.167 --> 03:18.792
trying to get support
from the military

03:18.875 --> 03:20.167
under the constitution

03:20.250 --> 03:21.583
but it doesn't look good.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.000
- Oh, my God.
- Where's General Hague?

03:24.083 --> 03:26.917
He was on his way back from IO
when all hell broke loose.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.333
Nobody's heard from him
since Monday.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.250
[explosion]

03:31.500 --> 03:33.542
Oh, no!

03:33.625 --> 03:36.500
The elite guard just opened fire
on the senate building.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.042
I have to go.

03:38.125 --> 03:39.667
I just wanted you to know

03:39.750 --> 03:43.125
General Hague's last communiqe
had a message for you.

03:43.208 --> 03:45.458
He said, "Everything's
gone to hell, John.

03:45.542 --> 03:48.167
God help us all.
You're on your own."

03:54.000 --> 03:58.292
(Ivanova)
The Babylon project was
our last best hope for peace.

04:01.958 --> 04:03.375
It failed.

04:04.417 --> 04:07.292
[instrumental music]

04:18.917 --> 04:20.375
But in the year
of the Shadow War

04:20.458 --> 04:22.708
it became something greater.

04:22.792 --> 04:24.833
Our last best hope..

04:24.917 --> 04:26.708
...for victory.

04:31.125 --> 04:33.500
The year is 2260.

04:33.583 --> 04:36.542
The place...Babylon 5.

04:39.083 --> 04:42.125
[theme music]

05:08.625 --> 05:11.458
[music continues]

05:21.667 --> 05:24.167
[intense music]

05:28.125 --> 05:29.458
By now, you've all
heard the news.

05:30.625 --> 05:31.917
In response to allegations

05:32.000 --> 05:34.542
of a conspiracy
against the government..

05:34.625 --> 05:38.583
....President Clark has declared
martial law back home

05:38.667 --> 05:41.417
and ordered Mars and IO
to enact similar restrictions.

05:42.833 --> 05:44.792
Now, they haven't hit us yet..

05:44.875 --> 05:47.875
...but you can be sure
that order will come soon.

05:47.958 --> 05:49.208
All communications to Earth

05:49.292 --> 05:51.250
have been blacked out
since 0800 this morning.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.958
Only the gold channels
are still functioning

05:53.042 --> 05:54.292
but those are to be used

05:54.375 --> 05:56.500
for official
military business only.

05:56.583 --> 06:00.208
I know many of you
have family back on Earth.

06:00.292 --> 06:02.917
We're doing everything we can
to find out what's going on.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Meanwhile, I ask you
to stay at your posts

06:06.083 --> 06:09.000
and continue as if
everything were status quo.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.667
'We've got a lot of
nervous people here.'

06:10.750 --> 06:14.042
And I'll need every one of you
to help calm things down.

06:14.125 --> 06:15.625
It's possible that
some other governments

06:15.708 --> 06:17.625
may take this as an opportunity
to move against us.

06:17.708 --> 06:19.958
So we must maintain
combat readiness.

06:20.042 --> 06:21.583
Continue the fly-bys.

06:21.667 --> 06:24.250
I want at least one squadron
on patrol outside the station

06:24.333 --> 06:25.875
at all times.

06:27.417 --> 06:29.458
Any questions?

06:29.542 --> 06:32.750
Captain, how did this happen?

06:32.833 --> 06:34.917
What did we do wrong?

06:37.708 --> 06:40.250
I don't know, lieutenant.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.000
I don't know.

06:46.583 --> 06:48.833
- Did you see their faces?
- I did.

06:48.917 --> 06:50.333
Now, John, what are
we going to do about this?

06:50.417 --> 06:52.042
Hey. There you are.

06:52.125 --> 06:54.542
- Did you hear the latest?
- No, what?

06:54.625 --> 06:56.958
They just put out a nine-system
alert for General Hague.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.167
The word is he's trying to
organize a counterstrike.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.000
If he can get enough
big ships to sign on

07:01.083 --> 07:02.500
he can go toe-to-toe
with President Clark.

07:02.583 --> 07:03.667
They'll never allow that,
they'll throw

07:03.750 --> 07:04.875
everything they've got at him.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.500
He's been our contact
from the start.

07:06.583 --> 07:08.750
They get him, they get us.

07:08.833 --> 07:11.625
Hey, private meeting
going on over here. Take a hike.

07:14.583 --> 07:16.667
Do you think Hague
will try and make it here?

07:16.750 --> 07:19.083
Yeah, it's possible.

07:19.167 --> 07:21.458
Keep monitoring ISN,
if he does come this way

07:21.542 --> 07:23.542
I want as much notice
as possible.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.250
This is bad.

07:26.333 --> 07:28.583
I've never seen it any worse.

07:31.458 --> 07:33.500
(woman on TV)
'With continuing reports
of heavy fighting'

07:33.583 --> 07:35.958
'outside the occupied
senate building.'

07:36.042 --> 07:38.333
'Meanwhile, President Clark
has offered amnesty'

07:38.417 --> 07:40.417
to anyone willing to surrender.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.208
Senator Borashevsky
of the Russian Consortium

07:43.292 --> 07:46.708
is urging citizens to surround
the senate in a living barrier.

07:46.792 --> 07:48.292
(male #2)
'Off.'

07:48.375 --> 07:50.292
What are you doing?
I was watching that.

07:50.375 --> 07:52.667
I've got something
more important for you.

07:52.750 --> 07:56.375
There's a nightwatch meeting
at 1100 hours. Be there.

07:56.458 --> 07:58.000
Excuse me. Haven't you
been paying attention?

07:58.083 --> 07:59.542
We don't have time for meetings.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.708
Make time. This one's important.

08:01.792 --> 08:03.375
See anybody else
on the watch, you tell them.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.125
But don't don't put it
on the link

08:05.208 --> 08:08.208
and don't tell anybody outside,
especially the chief.

08:08.958 --> 08:11.583
Oh, and one other thing.

08:11.667 --> 08:15.208
Make sure you bring some
extra caps for your PPG.

08:15.292 --> 08:18.625
I hope we don't need them,
but...you never know.

08:18.708 --> 08:21.625
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

08:21.708 --> 08:23.500
Come to the meeting
and find out.

08:27.292 --> 08:29.833
[G'Kar singing]

08:35.500 --> 08:37.083
Okay, okay.

08:37.167 --> 08:38.458
Get your stuff, G'Kar.
You're outta here.

08:38.542 --> 08:40.375
I thought I had another
three weeks to serve

08:40.458 --> 08:41.917
for my assault on Mollari.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.083
You do, but I need my people
out there, not guarding you.

08:44.167 --> 08:45.708
Besides,
everything else's gone to hell.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.042
What difference does it make?

08:47.125 --> 08:48.875
Yes, I've heard. My condolences.

08:48.958 --> 08:50.083
What are you going to do?

08:50.167 --> 08:51.167
Whatever we have to.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.833
Now, come on...unless you want

08:52.917 --> 08:54.750
to stay here
for the next three weeks.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.917
I might have something
for you in a little while

08:57.000 --> 09:00.167
Mr. Garibaldi,
when the time is right.

09:03.583 --> 09:06.458
[dramatic music]

09:11.583 --> 09:13.250
(Londo)
'Oh, madness.'

09:13.333 --> 09:17.250
I've been working on this
meeting for months, Vir, months.

09:17.333 --> 09:21.167
I had to make 10,000
assurances about her safety.

09:21.250 --> 09:24.625
I had to call in
every last favor I had

09:24.708 --> 09:27.750
to arrange for this visit
and now this happens.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.042
I still don't
understand why, Londo.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.500
What makes this visit
so important?

09:32.583 --> 09:33.708
Why Lady Morella?

09:33.792 --> 09:35.833
Oh, I, I suppose
you wouldn't know.

09:35.917 --> 09:37.667
It wasn't widely circulated.

09:37.750 --> 09:39.708
Emperor Turhan's third wife

09:39.792 --> 09:42.875
was a prophetess, a seer.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.750
'I need that right now, Vir.'

09:44.833 --> 09:47.125
I need to know
if the grand destiny

09:47.208 --> 09:49.542
I see before me is what is..

09:50.792 --> 09:52.250
...or what might be.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.667
So, you want her to tell you
it's all going to happen

09:54.750 --> 09:56.083
the way you see it?

09:56.167 --> 09:59.208
No, I want her
to tell me it won't.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.833
Ambassador Mollari.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.375
We are pleased to meet you.

10:07.458 --> 10:10.667
No, Great Lady,
the honor is mine.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.500
My assistant, Vir Cotto.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.042
Lady.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.500
We have heard much
about the, uh, the good work

10:16.583 --> 10:18.500
you have been doing here.

10:18.583 --> 10:22.375
We are looking forward
to the tour you have promised.

10:22.458 --> 10:24.167
But we are surprised

10:24.250 --> 10:27.292
there is no one else here
to meet us.

10:27.375 --> 10:29.542
Where are the Earth officials?

10:29.625 --> 10:32.583
There has been a problem
with the Earth alliance

10:32.667 --> 10:34.792
a local thing,
nothing to do with us

10:34.875 --> 10:37.625
but it has them rather...um..

10:37.708 --> 10:39.292
Distracted.

10:39.375 --> 10:42.333
Yes, distracted.

10:42.417 --> 10:44.167
They've asked me to
convey their regrets

10:44.250 --> 10:46.167
and to say they look
forward to meeting you

10:46.250 --> 10:47.875
'at your earliest convenience.'

10:47.958 --> 10:49.375
Would you like to
visit your quarters?

10:49.458 --> 10:52.042
I'm sure the trip here
must be very tiring.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.292
Uh, this way, please.

10:57.792 --> 10:59.917
Why does she speak in plural?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.500
When the emperor dies

11:01.583 --> 11:03.958
it is custom
for the royal consort

11:04.042 --> 11:06.500
to assume the spirit
of her husband.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.875
Though the power's now been
passed on to Emperor Cartagia

11:09.958 --> 11:12.667
it is presumed
that she speaks for Turhan

11:12.750 --> 11:13.875
from the other side.

11:13.958 --> 11:16.458
- 'Ambassador!'
- Coming, lady.

11:17.917 --> 11:21.583
Captain, I'm sure
you've been following the news.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.250
Yes, sir. If I may ask,
what's your opinion--

11:24.333 --> 11:27.250
My opinion has nothing
to do with this, captain.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.458
Neither does yours.

11:29.542 --> 11:32.708
Our job is to follow orders
from the commander in chief

11:32.792 --> 11:36.625
and respect
the chain of command.

11:36.708 --> 11:38.250
If you have different opinions

11:38.333 --> 11:40.667
I suggest you file them
in a deep, dark place

11:40.750 --> 11:42.875
where nobody
will ever find them.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.792
Am I clear?

11:44.875 --> 11:47.167
Yes, sir.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.917
(Smits)
'Captain, I have
your marching orders'

11:49.000 --> 11:51.583
although I'm quite positive
you're not gonna like them.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.208
I've been given assurances

11:53.292 --> 11:56.000
that this is
a temporary measure only.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.333
'Is your
head of security there?'

11:58.417 --> 12:00.292
Yes, sir, right here.

12:00.375 --> 12:03.792
(Smits)
'Good. What I'm about to say
is for your benefit as well.'

12:03.875 --> 12:07.083
The political office
has assigned responsibility

12:07.167 --> 12:08.875
for off-world security

12:08.958 --> 12:12.417
to nightwatch
personnel exclusively.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.792
What?

12:13.875 --> 12:15.708
So far as can be determined

12:15.792 --> 12:17.250
every branch of the government

12:17.333 --> 12:18.625
has been infected by people

12:18.708 --> 12:22.083
acting against the best
interests of Earth.

12:22.167 --> 12:23.500
In time,
we'll be able to figure out

12:23.583 --> 12:25.667
who can and can't be trusted.

12:25.750 --> 12:29.083
Until then, the nightwatch
will be in charge of security.

12:29.167 --> 12:30.708
Who's going to tell the captain?

12:33.083 --> 12:34.833
It's already been taken care of.

12:34.917 --> 12:36.417
According to the mandate

12:36.500 --> 12:39.042
issued by the security office

12:39.125 --> 12:41.417
your security team
should consist of those

12:41.500 --> 12:43.000
already in nightwatch

12:43.083 --> 12:45.333
and those who wish to join

12:45.417 --> 12:48.583
after certain background
checks have been concluded.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.667
General, I object to this
in the strongest--

12:50.750 --> 12:54.458
Captain, didn't you
hear me a moment ago?

12:54.542 --> 12:57.792
I told you where
this comes from.

12:57.875 --> 12:59.125
Now, if you've got a problem

12:59.208 --> 13:02.542
I suggest you look upon
this as an opportunity..

13:02.625 --> 13:04.333
...not a burden.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.083
This is the opportunity
that we've been

13:06.167 --> 13:07.542
working towards
since the beginning

13:07.625 --> 13:10.708
to serve Earth
to the best of our ability.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.458
It's the chance
to set things right.

13:14.542 --> 13:17.375
Now they've handed us
the power, the authority

13:17.458 --> 13:18.625
and the responsibility.

13:18.708 --> 13:21.208
We've got to take it
for all its worth.

13:21.292 --> 13:24.167
Our job now is to find
the traitors among us.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.667
Using whatever means
we think are appropriate

13:26.750 --> 13:30.375
whoever they are,
wherever they are.

13:30.458 --> 13:33.333
As of this moment..

13:33.417 --> 13:37.125
...Babylon 5
belongs to the nightwatch.

13:49.833 --> 13:51.500
Ta'Lon.

13:51.583 --> 13:53.542
Citizen G'Kar.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.583
Have you been waiting to see me?

13:57.333 --> 14:00.250
I, I hope you have not
been waiting long.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.542
Three, four days.

14:02.625 --> 14:05.417
I sleep on the fifth day,
return on the sixth.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.833
And you have been doing this
since my incarceration?

14:12.958 --> 14:16.167
I have sensed an opportunity
to repay my debt.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.708
I didn't want to miss it.

14:21.042 --> 14:22.750
Then you shall not.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.500
[door opens]

14:26.583 --> 14:30.083
We stand at a moment
of transition.

14:30.167 --> 14:32.417
I may need your help
before this is over.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.208
"Connor, Jefferson T."

14:42.000 --> 14:43.458
Remember, check in
with Rishi on the way out

14:43.542 --> 14:45.125
so he can finish
background checks.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.000
"Cupertino, Malcolm."

14:52.125 --> 14:54.917
[intense music]

14:58.417 --> 14:59.667
Malcolm, come on.

14:59.750 --> 15:01.458
Suit yourself.

15:03.792 --> 15:05.083
Next.

15:06.583 --> 15:07.958
(Michael)
Damn it, captain, I'm going

15:08.042 --> 15:09.625
down there and
I'm going to stop this.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.792
- Michael, you can't do that.
- Oh, yeah? Watch me.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.417
It took me three years
to put this team together

15:14.500 --> 15:15.833
the way I wanted it.
Three years.

15:15.917 --> 15:17.458
And now these guys come in
from the outside and start

15:17.542 --> 15:19.625
people off
because they're not nightwatch?

15:19.708 --> 15:21.458
Like, hell. I'll quit first.

15:21.542 --> 15:22.708
- You don't mean that.
- No.

15:22.792 --> 15:25.208
No, I need you
right where you are.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.000
If you go in there guns blazing

15:27.083 --> 15:28.667
you're just gonna give them
the reason they need

15:28.750 --> 15:30.083
to push you out.

15:30.167 --> 15:33.000
Now without that
I can fight to keep you in.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.417
- I won't put on that armband.
- You won't have too.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.167
There are other ways
of dealing with this.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.333
I-I don't know what they are,
but we'll find them.

15:39.417 --> 15:40.500
Alright, fine,
you look for them.

15:40.583 --> 15:42.167
Me, I'm going down there.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.500
And maybe I'll bust some heads,
and maybe they'll bust mine

15:44.583 --> 15:47.667
but nobody sells out my people
like this. Nobody.

15:47.750 --> 15:51.000
Are you ready to start
your tour of the station?

15:51.083 --> 15:54.375
Our people here are
looking forward to meeting you.

15:54.458 --> 15:56.625
Almost. Another moment.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.458
Why have you
asked us here, Mollari?

16:02.000 --> 16:05.208
As I said, to show you how our
agreement with the Earth is--

16:05.292 --> 16:07.958
The Earthers have
problems of their own.

16:08.042 --> 16:11.417
The alliance was never my
husband's plan for our people.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.458
He came to try
to to prevent the insanity

16:15.542 --> 16:17.500
he knew was coming.

16:17.583 --> 16:20.375
Instead, his death
became the door

16:20.458 --> 16:23.750
through which
all this pain has entered.

16:23.833 --> 16:26.000
I was there when he left us.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.333
He was a great man.

16:29.417 --> 16:32.042
Yes. Yes, he was.

16:33.958 --> 16:36.500
But greatness is never
appreciated in youth.

16:36.583 --> 16:39.208
Called pride in midlife..

16:39.292 --> 16:42.625
...dismissed in old age,
and reconsidered in death.

16:42.708 --> 16:46.542
Because we cannot tolerate
greatness in our midst

16:46.625 --> 16:49.542
we do all we can to destroy it.

16:49.625 --> 16:51.708
This place has become a memorial

16:51.792 --> 16:53.833
to his unfinished work.

16:55.333 --> 16:58.208
[instrumental music]

16:58.292 --> 17:00.250
I ask you again.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.333
Why have you brought us here?

17:03.583 --> 17:05.750
I need you to see for me.

17:07.458 --> 17:09.792
'I believe that
I have been touched.'

17:10.750 --> 17:12.917
That I am..

17:13.000 --> 17:15.583
...meant for something greater..

17:15.667 --> 17:17.250
A greater darkness
or a greater good

17:17.333 --> 17:19.417
I can no longer say.

17:20.750 --> 17:23.833
All I have ever wanted
is to serve our people.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.875
I need to see
what is before me..

17:27.958 --> 17:31.083
...if I should escape it,
or embrace it..

17:32.667 --> 17:35.750
...if there is any longer
a choice.

17:35.833 --> 17:38.375
Oh, there's always choice.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.125
We say there is no choice

17:40.208 --> 17:41.458
only to comfort ourselves

17:41.542 --> 17:43.458
with the decision
we have already made.

17:43.542 --> 17:46.667
If you understand that,
there's hope.

17:46.750 --> 17:48.542
If not..

17:52.583 --> 17:55.542
I will honor
your request, Mollari.

17:55.625 --> 17:58.208
Before I leave here,
you will have your reading.

18:07.167 --> 18:08.333
"Pirello, Frances."

18:08.417 --> 18:09.875
[whispering]
We have some trouble, sir.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.125
I got to go.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.750
(male #2)
'"Johnson, James."'

18:20.083 --> 18:21.625
- Chief--
- Get out of my way, Zack.

18:21.708 --> 18:22.917
Look, I know you're upset.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.333
I'm upset about this as you are.

18:24.417 --> 18:25.500
Yeah, you wanna bet?

18:25.583 --> 18:27.083
But you can't go in there
like that.

18:27.167 --> 18:28.875
Now just put this on.
Just play along with it.

18:28.958 --> 18:30.333
Like hell.

18:30.417 --> 18:32.625
You come flying the colors,
nobody's going to question it.

18:32.708 --> 18:34.542
- The other guys won't let him.
- I said, no.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.958
- Chief, will you listen--
- No, you listen to me, Zack.

18:37.042 --> 18:38.500
This isn't a game.

18:38.583 --> 18:40.042
You better get your priorities
straight and you better

18:40.125 --> 18:42.500
do it fast because hell's
coming five steps behind me.

18:42.583 --> 18:43.708
You don't want to be
on the wrong side

18:43.792 --> 18:45.333
when it gets here.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.417
Excuse me.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.458
I'm not interrupting anything,
am I?

18:52.542 --> 18:55.125
This is the way
it's got to be, chief.

18:55.208 --> 18:56.750
Don't make a scene.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.000
Who, me?

18:59.083 --> 19:01.750
Make a scene?
What, are you nuts?

19:03.125 --> 19:06.000
Now, you listen to me,
all of you!

19:07.625 --> 19:09.750
Three years you worked for me.

19:09.833 --> 19:11.833
I took care of you,
I looked after you.

19:13.292 --> 19:14.958
Pastorelli..

19:15.042 --> 19:16.958
...I fixed you up
with your wife, right?

19:21.458 --> 19:23.458
Connor. Connor, how about you?

19:23.542 --> 19:24.708
When nobody else
would give you a break

19:24.792 --> 19:26.625
I took you in
I gave you a job, right?

19:29.333 --> 19:32.250
Damn it, for three years
we worked together as a team.

19:32.333 --> 19:35.167
Now, all of a sudden anybody
who's not nightwatch gets fired?

19:35.250 --> 19:37.083
Come on,
think for crying out loud!

19:37.167 --> 19:38.417
We have thought about it, chief.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.417
And we need to know
where everybody stands.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.417
Are you with us or against us?

19:42.500 --> 19:45.458
[intense music]

19:47.500 --> 19:49.875
Who's this "us?"

19:49.958 --> 19:52.625
I thought "us" was
what we've got right here.

19:52.708 --> 19:55.292
Now "us" is suddenly anybody
who says the right things

19:55.375 --> 19:57.042
or wears a rag
around their arm.

19:57.125 --> 19:59.833
Everybody else is the bad guy,
right? Says who?

19:59.917 --> 20:01.750
Bunch of clowns back home
who don't give a damn about

20:01.833 --> 20:04.583
anything but
their own political agendas?

20:04.667 --> 20:07.083
Come on,
you don't work for nightwatch.

20:07.167 --> 20:09.583
You work for the captain.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.625
You work for the station,
and you work for me.

20:11.708 --> 20:13.958
I'm asking you,
all of you to drop this.

20:14.042 --> 20:16.167
Come on, rip these things
off your arms

20:16.250 --> 20:18.083
and stop tearing
each other apart.

20:19.708 --> 20:21.083
If anything
I've ever said or done

20:21.167 --> 20:24.375
has meant a damn to you,
then stop this

20:24.458 --> 20:25.917
stop this now.

20:28.125 --> 20:30.667
[music continues]

20:32.500 --> 20:33.917
Chief..

20:35.375 --> 20:37.458
...as acting representative
of the nightwatch

20:37.542 --> 20:40.208
you are relieved.

20:40.292 --> 20:42.250
Zack, as second in command,
you're now in charge

20:42.333 --> 20:44.042
'of security.'

20:44.125 --> 20:47.208
Mr. Garibaldi is no longer
authorized to be in this area.

20:48.542 --> 20:50.083
Please escort him elsewhere.

20:51.292 --> 20:52.958
I know the way.

20:54.375 --> 20:57.875
Is this the way
you wanted it, Zack? Is it?

21:05.792 --> 21:07.875
You must understand, Ta'Lon

21:07.958 --> 21:10.000
I have had a revelation.

21:10.083 --> 21:12.125
What kind of revelation?

21:13.750 --> 21:17.875
A most profound
and substantial one, Ta'Lon.

21:19.417 --> 21:22.292
The kind of revelation
that transforms your mind..

21:24.250 --> 21:25.917
...your soul..

21:27.875 --> 21:30.292
...your heart..

21:30.375 --> 21:33.292
...even your flesh.

21:33.375 --> 21:36.583
So that you are a new creature..

21:36.667 --> 21:39.542
...reborn in the instant
of understanding.

21:39.625 --> 21:43.458
That was a stirring reply,
citizen G'Kar.

21:43.542 --> 21:46.708
Unfortunately, while
all answers are replies

21:46.792 --> 21:49.750
not all replies are answers.

21:49.833 --> 21:52.333
You did not answer
the question that I asked.

21:53.333 --> 21:54.583
What do you understand now

21:54.667 --> 21:56.958
that you did not
understand before?

22:03.708 --> 22:06.375
It's all here in these pages.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.417
I have tried to write down
what I have seen.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.208
It may take the rest of my life

22:11.292 --> 22:14.042
to explain what I saw..

22:15.167 --> 22:17.833
...in that one singular instant.

22:22.167 --> 22:24.542
To save our people..

22:24.625 --> 22:27.542
...we must sacrifice our people.

22:27.625 --> 22:29.750
We must sacrifice ourselves.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.792
Our pride, our vengeance.

22:33.875 --> 22:36.875
Be willing to die by
the thousands, by the millions

22:36.958 --> 22:38.542
for one another.

22:39.875 --> 22:41.458
The more we fight for ourselves

22:41.542 --> 22:44.167
the more we will lose ourselves.

22:47.208 --> 22:48.708
We are linked, Ta'Lon.

22:48.792 --> 22:52.250
Our fate is like an image
caught in a mirror.

22:52.333 --> 22:56.250
If we deny the other,
we deny ourselves.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.583
And we all cease to exist.

22:58.667 --> 23:01.167
And who or what
is this "other?"

23:02.208 --> 23:04.375
The universe itself, Ta'Lon.

23:05.667 --> 23:09.625
But the humans,
they are the key.

23:09.708 --> 23:12.875
And together,
you and I and the rest..

23:12.958 --> 23:15.458
...we will turn that key

23:15.542 --> 23:17.792
because on the other side

23:17.875 --> 23:20.750
is salvation for all of us.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.958
[instrumental music]

23:25.042 --> 23:26.917
Captain, are you alright?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.750
The order came in.

23:30.167 --> 23:33.458
Tell the others, martial law
effective immediately.

23:34.833 --> 23:36.333
I'll give the announcement
a little while just

23:36.417 --> 23:38.333
as soon as I can stomach it.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.500
Do you want me to be there?

23:40.583 --> 23:42.500
No, no,
I'd better do this on my own

23:42.583 --> 23:44.625
keep you out of it,
as much as I can.

23:44.708 --> 23:46.333
- Captain, I--
- I'm alright.

23:48.417 --> 23:50.000
It's funny, I..

23:51.417 --> 23:53.750
I wish Delenn were here.

23:53.833 --> 23:57.250
Any word from
or about General Hague?

23:57.333 --> 23:59.083
No, sir, not yet.

24:06.083 --> 24:09.875
Alright, break it up.
Break it up here.

24:09.958 --> 24:12.333
Come on.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.208
This is the Zocalo.

24:14.292 --> 24:15.833
Zocalo is a human word.

24:15.917 --> 24:18.333
It's from one of their
southern continents.

24:18.417 --> 24:21.542
I think it means,
great marketplace.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.875
There's seems to be a good deal
of commotion here.

24:23.958 --> 24:26.667
Yes, it is a very busy place.
Lots of trading--

24:26.750 --> 24:29.583
Hey! Over here!
They started shooting!

24:29.667 --> 24:32.250
Lady Morella,
the tour is this way.

24:32.333 --> 24:35.083
Yes, it is.

24:35.167 --> 24:37.250
(woman on TV)
'Repeating this
special bulletin'

24:37.333 --> 24:39.958
'we have just received
raw footage of a firefight'

24:40.042 --> 24:42.708
'between Earthforce ships
taking place even now'

24:42.792 --> 24:44.708
'at the transfer point on Io'.

24:44.792 --> 24:47.375
'The main vessel has been
positively identified'

24:47.458 --> 24:48.708
'as The Alexander'

24:48.792 --> 24:50.833
under the command
of General William Hague.

24:50.917 --> 24:53.333
The Alexander and
her two companion vessels

24:53.417 --> 24:55.708
have been surrounded
by Earthforce cruisers

24:55.792 --> 24:57.667
and ordered to surrender.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.708
The Alexander has
refused to surrender

24:59.792 --> 25:01.875
'and is calling for
other Earthforce divisions'

25:02.000 --> 25:04.917
to join in opposing
President Clark.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.792
For the first time
since the early days

25:06.875 --> 25:08.250
of the Mars rebellion

25:08.333 --> 25:10.417
'Earth vessels are
fighting one another.'

25:10.500 --> 25:11.917
Hey, let's break it up.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.417
Break it up. Let's go.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.000
[cheering]

25:15.083 --> 25:17.042
'The Excalibur and
The Schwarzkopf have been hit'

25:17.125 --> 25:19.125
'allowing Hague and his
companion vessels to escape.'

25:19.208 --> 25:21.083
[cheering]

25:21.167 --> 25:22.667
Alright, everybody, out of here.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.292
Come on, let's move it.
You're inciting a riot.

25:24.375 --> 25:26.917
Get out of here, now!
Move it! Let's go!

25:27.000 --> 25:28.958
Lady Morella,
we should really go now.

25:29.042 --> 25:30.417
Perhaps we should.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.542
Disperse! Let's go! Move along.

25:32.625 --> 25:34.625
Come on, hey,
come on, move along.

25:34.708 --> 25:36.500
Hey! Get in there. Move!

25:36.583 --> 25:38.625
[grunting]

25:41.500 --> 25:44.375
[instrumental music]

25:44.458 --> 25:45.958
This is Captain John Sheridan

25:46.042 --> 25:47.375
commander of Babylon 5.

25:48.583 --> 25:51.333
Ohh! Oh! Oh, help him. Guards!

25:51.417 --> 25:55.167
I've received orders
this day, April 9, 2260

25:55.250 --> 25:57.500
from the President
of the Earth alliance

25:57.583 --> 25:59.792
declaring a state of emergency.

25:59.875 --> 26:02.917
As of this moment,
Babylon 5 is under martial law.

26:04.208 --> 26:06.458
'A curfew of 19:00 hours
will be maintained'

26:06.542 --> 26:08.417
'until further notice.'

26:08.500 --> 26:10.792
Station personnel
reserve the right

26:10.875 --> 26:13.125
to intercept and
monitor communications

26:13.208 --> 26:15.625
'in and out of Babylon 5.'

26:15.708 --> 26:17.708
There'll be stiff penalties
against anyone

26:17.792 --> 26:19.625
caught inciting to riot

26:19.708 --> 26:23.125
'or taking any action against
the security of this station'

26:23.208 --> 26:25.000
'Earth, or any of its holdings.'

26:25.083 --> 26:28.583
Copies of the notice will be
posted in all public places.

26:28.667 --> 26:32.167
Inquiries should be directed
to command staff or myself.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.833
Thank you for your attention.

26:37.917 --> 26:40.750
[instrumental music]

26:51.583 --> 26:53.167
Feel like I need a shower.

26:54.458 --> 26:56.292
Look, I'm sorry,
I, I know that wasn't easy

26:56.375 --> 26:58.333
but it had to be done.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.458
I can't let this go on.

27:00.542 --> 27:03.208
Look, they say this
is going to blow over.

27:03.292 --> 27:05.417
Alright, now, if-if Hague
can pull together enough

27:05.500 --> 27:07.500
of the military and if
the senate can get it together

27:07.583 --> 27:10.125
we can beat this thing,
I know we can.

27:10.208 --> 27:13.667
We just need to help buy
some time, that's all.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.375
Unfortunately,
we can't do anything

27:15.458 --> 27:17.708
as long as nightwatch
is running security.

27:17.792 --> 27:19.667
We are penned in.

27:19.750 --> 27:22.000
'They're monitoring
every channel.'

27:22.083 --> 27:24.083
If we try to get through
to Hague or anyone else

27:24.167 --> 27:25.458
they will turn us in.

27:25.542 --> 27:27.958
I know. I know.
How do you stop them though?

27:28.042 --> 27:29.958
You can't fight
the chain of command.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.958
That's what he meant.

27:38.375 --> 27:39.500
That's what he was
trying to tell me

27:39.583 --> 27:40.875
but he couldn't say anything

27:40.958 --> 27:42.625
because he knew it wasn't
a secure channel.

27:42.708 --> 27:44.750
- Who?
- General Smits.

27:46.458 --> 27:47.750
Find Garibaldi.
Don't use the links.

27:47.833 --> 27:48.917
They're not secure anymore but

27:49.042 --> 27:51.875
get him here as fast as you can.

27:51.958 --> 27:53.292
Yes.

27:54.833 --> 27:56.458
[beeping]

27:58.333 --> 28:01.708
Our job is to follow the orders
of the commander in chief

28:01.792 --> 28:04.083
and respect
the chain of command.

28:04.167 --> 28:06.625
[beeping]

28:06.708 --> 28:09.708
The political office
has assigned responsibility

28:09.792 --> 28:12.000
for off-world security

28:12.083 --> 28:13.917
to nightwatch personnel exclu..

28:14.000 --> 28:15.667
[beeping]

28:15.750 --> 28:18.917
I told you where
this comes from.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.583
Now, if you got a problem

28:20.667 --> 28:22.083
I suggest you look upon this

28:22.167 --> 28:24.958
as an opportunity not a burden.

28:25.042 --> 28:27.458
[beeping]

28:27.542 --> 28:29.500
'The political office
has assigned res..'

28:29.583 --> 28:31.667

28:31.750 --> 28:34.042

[beeps]

28:39.875 --> 28:42.708
[instrumental music]

28:56.375 --> 28:58.583
G'Kar, what are you doing here?

28:58.667 --> 29:00.292
Saving all of us.

29:00.375 --> 29:02.250
I've had..

29:05.958 --> 29:07.792
...an idea.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.250
[coughs]

29:16.458 --> 29:17.792
[sighs]

29:24.042 --> 29:25.667
Get in.

29:29.333 --> 29:31.583
Lady, you shouldn't be
doing this.

29:31.667 --> 29:33.167
He's right.

29:33.250 --> 29:36.833
Next thing he'll be expecting
is sympathy, a raise.

29:36.917 --> 29:38.167
The medical bays are full.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.208
He was injured
while saving us from harm.

29:40.292 --> 29:43.292
We will attend him.
Another cloth, please.

29:43.375 --> 29:45.167
Yes, another cloth, please.

29:52.625 --> 29:55.458
[intense music]

30:04.292 --> 30:05.458
Thank you.

30:07.125 --> 30:08.958
[inaudible dialogue]

30:13.458 --> 30:15.667
Where you been, Zack?
You missed all the fun.

30:17.542 --> 30:20.625
I was in a meeting
with the captain.

30:20.708 --> 30:22.500
The chief and G'Kar.

30:25.458 --> 30:27.750
At 0300, a ship's
going to dock in bay 9.

30:27.833 --> 30:29.292
It'll be carrying
a couple hundred Narns

30:29.375 --> 30:31.417
from other colonies.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.625
They're being brought in
to replace us.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.917
They wanted me to help them..

30:38.000 --> 30:40.833
...but I can't.

30:40.917 --> 30:42.417
I just can't do it.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.708
We'll be there
when the ship comes in.

30:44.792 --> 30:46.333
We'll catch them
in the act of sedition

30:46.417 --> 30:48.000
before they can organize.

30:50.125 --> 30:52.917
You did the right thing, Zack.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.042
You did the right thing.

31:00.333 --> 31:03.042
In the time I have been here

31:03.125 --> 31:06.083
I have asked little of you
for myself.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.833
I have tried to give you
the guidance and support

31:09.917 --> 31:12.542
that is my responsibility
as one of the Kha'ri..

31:14.458 --> 31:17.917
...but I come to you now
in a moment of great need.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.875
In a few hours,
I will need your help

31:19.958 --> 31:22.208
as I never have never
needed it before.

31:23.542 --> 31:25.417
I know it is much to ask..

31:26.750 --> 31:29.292
...but it is well past time..

31:29.375 --> 31:31.792
...to ask.

31:31.875 --> 31:33.667
[intense music]

31:33.750 --> 31:34.917
[beeping]

31:35.000 --> 31:37.458

'The time is 02:30.'

31:37.542 --> 31:40.417
'This is your
requested wake-up time.'

32:00.917 --> 32:03.833
[music continues]

32:06.042 --> 32:08.875
(male #2)
We don't know how many Narns
will be getting off that ship.

32:08.958 --> 32:10.708
So, we'll need
everyone we've got.

32:10.792 --> 32:14.292
We'll meet in bay 8 and go in
as soon as the ship docks.

32:16.625 --> 32:18.292
As soon as we have them
and the proof

32:18.375 --> 32:21.333
we'll arrest Sheridan
and anyone else involved.

32:28.042 --> 32:31.000
Let them come.
We're ready for them.

32:31.083 --> 32:33.917
[music continues]

32:41.917 --> 32:44.208
Alright! Move it out! Let's go!

32:44.292 --> 32:46.750
- Keep it moving now. Keep--
- Head it up! Let's move!

32:46.833 --> 32:49.333
(male #3)
'Yes, sir!'

32:49.417 --> 32:51.250
Come on, people!

32:51.333 --> 32:52.417
Everybody here?

32:52.500 --> 32:54.125
Yeah. Everybody who'd come.

32:54.208 --> 32:55.625
We've still got some
who won't play ball

32:55.708 --> 32:57.875
but we'll take care
of them later.

32:57.958 --> 33:00.375
- Now that we know who they are.
- That we can.

33:00.458 --> 33:02.000
It's almost time.

33:03.583 --> 33:05.750
Okay, people!

33:05.833 --> 33:07.458
Heat them up!

33:07.542 --> 33:09.500
Stand by.

33:09.583 --> 33:11.333
We've got some work to do.

33:14.458 --> 33:15.500
Now.

33:18.292 --> 33:19.625
The other gate!

'Hey!'

33:33.792 --> 33:35.708
Hey, you alright?

33:35.792 --> 33:37.792
Yeah, yeah.

33:37.875 --> 33:39.083
You did the right thing, Zack.

33:39.167 --> 33:40.708
Everybody always says that.

33:40.792 --> 33:42.750
I don't know
who means it anymore.

33:42.833 --> 33:44.750
Yeah, this time, maybe I did.

33:44.833 --> 33:45.875
Yeah.

33:48.083 --> 33:50.000
They're all yours, captain.

33:50.083 --> 33:51.625
Thanks, Zack.

33:51.708 --> 33:54.042
- Bring them in.
- Okay, people.

33:55.875 --> 33:57.458
Activate PA.

33:57.542 --> 33:58.708
[indistinct shouting]

33:58.792 --> 34:00.000
Where's the emergency exit?

34:00.083 --> 34:01.750

'This is the captain.'

34:01.833 --> 34:03.417
'Can I have your attention?'

34:05.667 --> 34:10.042
As of this time,
03:15 Earth standard time..

34:10.125 --> 34:12.375
...I'm placing you under arrest

34:12.458 --> 34:14.292
for conspiracy to mutiny

and failure to obey

34:42.500 --> 34:44.500
'through the Joint
Chiefs of Staff'

34:44.583 --> 34:47.583
to your immediate
superior officers.

34:47.667 --> 34:50.917
A senator cannot give you
a direct order.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.375
A governor cannot give you
a direct order..

34:54.458 --> 34:56.625
...and neither can
the political office.

34:56.708 --> 34:58.542
Make no mistake.

34:58.625 --> 35:01.250
This is an illegal order.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.167
'Now, we've contacted
Earthdome and requested'

35:03.250 --> 35:06.958
'confirmation of this order
through proper channels..'

35:07.042 --> 35:09.500
'But since we seem
to be having trouble'

35:09.583 --> 35:12.833
'with communications,
this may take several days.'

35:12.917 --> 35:15.833
'Until then,
you have two choices..'

35:15.917 --> 35:18.042
'...you can stay where you are'

35:18.125 --> 35:20.125
'or you can leave..'

35:20.208 --> 35:22.083
...one at a time.

35:22.167 --> 35:23.417
On your way out

35:23.500 --> 35:25.208
you'll turn in your link

35:25.292 --> 35:27.833
identicard, and weapons.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.292
You'll be restricted to quarters

35:29.375 --> 35:31.208
until the revised orders
come in.

35:32.292 --> 35:34.833
When that happens..

35:34.917 --> 35:37.250
...anyone who wants to file
a complaint against me

35:37.333 --> 35:38.917
can do so.

35:39.917 --> 35:42.250
Otherwise..

35:42.333 --> 35:44.542
...have a pleasant stay.

35:44.625 --> 35:45.833
'Oh, and one other thing..'

35:45.917 --> 35:47.292
'If I were you'

35:47.375 --> 35:50.625
'I wouldn't use my weapons
on the airlocks.'

35:50.708 --> 35:53.792
'They're a solid
Beryllium alloy.'

35:53.875 --> 35:55.917
'Ricochet's a killer.'

35:57.583 --> 36:00.042
PA off.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.875
Doc, I'm gonna need you
to stay around for a while

36:01.958 --> 36:04.667
in case anybody, uh,
ignores my warning

36:04.750 --> 36:06.208
and tries to burn
his way through.

36:06.292 --> 36:07.417
You got it.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.417
You do realize this is a

36:08.500 --> 36:10.042
temporary solution at best.

36:10.125 --> 36:11.667
I mean, as soon Clark finds out
about this, he'll reissue

36:11.750 --> 36:14.042
the order personally.
We'll be back where we started.

36:14.125 --> 36:17.583
Yeah, not if they straighten
things out back home..

36:17.667 --> 36:19.292
...or Hague pulls off a coup.

36:19.375 --> 36:21.417
We just need to buy enough time
for that to happen.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.583
One thing I'm not clear on,
keeping everybody in there

36:23.667 --> 36:26.125
is going to cut our
security patrols in half.

36:26.208 --> 36:27.708
Doesn't that worry anybody?

36:27.792 --> 36:29.458
Not really.

36:30.708 --> 36:32.542
We've got some help
for a change.

36:36.417 --> 36:38.917
You're kidding.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.833
You're not kidding.

36:40.917 --> 36:43.708
Always plant a lie
inside a truth.

36:43.792 --> 36:45.792
Makes it easier to swallow.

36:45.875 --> 36:49.083
Oh, boy,
Londo is going to love this.

36:49.167 --> 36:50.667
Oh, yeah.

36:52.208 --> 36:53.458
What we are about to say

36:53.542 --> 36:57.458
is for your ears only,
Ambassador Mollari.

36:57.542 --> 37:00.458
We will not repeat it
to others at the royal court

37:00.542 --> 37:02.333
and suggest you do the same.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.458
If it comes out

37:05.542 --> 37:08.208
we will deny this conversation
ever took place.

37:09.667 --> 37:11.958
Of course.

37:12.042 --> 37:15.875
You have a chance few others
will ever have, Mollari.

37:15.958 --> 37:19.125
You still have three
opportunities to avoid the fire

37:19.208 --> 37:22.042
that waits for you
at the end of your journey.

37:22.125 --> 37:24.375
'You've already
wasted two others.'

37:25.708 --> 37:29.125
You must save the eye
that does not see.

37:29.208 --> 37:31.917
'You must not kill the one
who is already dead'

37:32.000 --> 37:34.167
and at the last..

37:34.250 --> 37:37.667
...you must surrender yourself
to your greatest fear.

37:37.750 --> 37:40.167
Knowing that it
will destroy you.

37:40.250 --> 37:43.333
Now, if you have
failed all the others..

37:43.417 --> 37:46.458
...that is your final
chance for redemption.

37:46.542 --> 37:49.333
I..

37:49.417 --> 37:52.000
...don't understand.

37:52.083 --> 37:56.542
The future reveals itself
only reluctantly, ambassador.

37:56.625 --> 37:59.167
Take the sign
for what it is.

37:59.250 --> 38:01.208
Look for it when it appears.

38:02.917 --> 38:05.125
I will. Thank you.

38:09.083 --> 38:10.750
One more thing..

38:14.500 --> 38:16.792
...you will be emperor.

38:16.875 --> 38:19.125
That part of your destiny
cannot be avoided.

38:20.042 --> 38:21.750
I see.

38:23.625 --> 38:25.708
You will also be emperor.

38:27.667 --> 38:30.125
[laughs]

38:32.917 --> 38:34.583
Why are you laughing?

38:36.458 --> 38:40.792
I.. I-I thought you were joking.

38:40.875 --> 38:43.875
We do not joke
in the face of prophecy, Vir.

38:51.542 --> 38:54.042
Lady Morella, please.

38:54.125 --> 38:56.417
We cannot both be emperor.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.250
Correct.

38:59.333 --> 39:02.042
One of you will become emperor..

39:02.125 --> 39:04.208
...after the other's dead.

39:07.208 --> 39:08.583
'That is all we see'

39:08.667 --> 39:10.542
and all we wish to see.

39:12.875 --> 39:15.875
[intense music]

39:24.375 --> 39:26.917
[dramatic music]

39:55.333 --> 39:58.792
I wanted to thank you again
for helping us out, G'Kar.

39:58.875 --> 40:00.750
Since putting the Narns
on security detail

40:00.833 --> 40:03.375
we've actually had a drop
on the crime rate.

40:03.458 --> 40:05.375
And they have managed to handle

40:05.458 --> 40:07.583
even the Centauri
without a problem.

40:07.667 --> 40:09.625
They understand
what is at stake.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.250
Well, I appreciate it.

40:11.333 --> 40:13.167
If there's anything
that I can do--

40:13.250 --> 40:14.792
There is.

40:17.042 --> 40:18.458
I want in.

40:21.875 --> 40:23.167
In on what?

40:23.250 --> 40:25.458
You have been assembling
a new alliance.

40:25.542 --> 40:30.125
Don't try to deny it. I've been
here too long not to notice.

40:30.208 --> 40:32.667
I wish to join.

40:32.750 --> 40:35.625
I'll, uh, have to talk it over
with the others.

40:35.708 --> 40:37.458
Please do so.

40:37.542 --> 40:39.208
I have time..

40:39.292 --> 40:41.417
...all the time in the world.

40:42.708 --> 40:43.792
Do you?

41:00.417 --> 41:02.333
Don't you have somewhere to go?

41:03.458 --> 41:05.792
Me? No, not really, no.

41:07.125 --> 41:10.083
I thought your ship
was leaving soon for Minbar.

41:10.167 --> 41:14.708
Oh, no. That's tomorrow, it..
Tomorrow it's..

41:14.792 --> 41:17.333
Tomorrow. Tomorrow.

41:23.458 --> 41:26.708
One of you will become emperor..

41:26.792 --> 41:29.125
...after the other dies.

41:33.333 --> 41:35.708
- Nonsense.
- Of course.

41:35.792 --> 41:38.333
[laughing]

41:42.833 --> 41:44.667
I've made some dinner.

41:46.917 --> 41:48.667
I'm not hungry.

41:53.333 --> 41:55.375
You're not saying that
you don't trust me anymore

41:55.458 --> 41:58.833
are you, Londo?
I-I made your favorite spoo.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.708
I'll order in.

42:10.750 --> 42:12.083
Ambassador Delenn just got back.

42:12.167 --> 42:13.458
She's looking forward
to talking to you

42:13.542 --> 42:15.250
about everything
that's happened.

42:15.333 --> 42:16.917
Good. Good.

42:18.750 --> 42:21.208
Is there anything else?

42:21.292 --> 42:24.583
[sighs]
I just saw a report on ISN..

42:24.667 --> 42:26.292
...four of the five cruisers

42:26.375 --> 42:29.417
that defected with General Hague
have been shot down.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.458
They say he's on the run..

42:31.542 --> 42:32.875
...and they expect
to capture him

42:32.958 --> 42:34.750
next time he comes out
of hyperspace.

42:35.958 --> 42:38.292
Well, he won't go down
without a fight.

42:38.375 --> 42:40.167
No, sir. No, he won't.

42:42.875 --> 42:44.375
They'll be coming
for us next, you know.

42:45.042 --> 42:46.583
I know.

42:50.542 --> 42:52.500
Never thought
it would end like this.

42:55.417 --> 42:57.375
Me either.

43:05.500 --> 43:07.833
[theme music]
