it's like cream I think he might like

06:02.930 --> 06:17.759
that

06:04.610 --> 06:20.960
that's if you have the taste buds

06:17.759 --> 06:24.500
mmm these are great

06:20.959 --> 06:28.038
I I i think this press Keiko has on use

06:24.500 --> 06:31.339
the cutest thing I've seen what the

06:28.038 --> 06:32.870
crash you know the co has on you time

06:31.339 --> 06:35.179
you were so wrong

06:32.870 --> 06:38.240
really all of a sudden she's bringing

06:35.180 --> 06:40.220
you soap and homemade pastries your

06:38.240 --> 06:43.250
imaginations running well she's not

06:40.220 --> 06:48.259
doing it for the rest of us

06:43.250 --> 06:51.348
you can't really be this naive the gift

06:48.259 --> 07:14.830
of food is a tradition in water level

06:51.348 --> 07:17.920
Lions have a lot of traditional gifts

07:14.829 --> 07:22.389
hey hey wanna hear that juicy gossip

07:17.920 --> 07:26.470
haha tell me i hate wasn't right

07:22.389 --> 07:27.550
oh wait wait now that now that you

07:26.470 --> 07:31.180
started it

07:27.550 --> 07:33.910
what is it ok so I have a crush on Sean

07:31.180 --> 07:36.370
oh well it doesn't really surprise me

07:33.910 --> 07:38.380
think we all do is write protected

07:36.370 --> 07:42.069
yeah but she's taking it one step

07:38.379 --> 07:43.300
further she's being very proactive what

07:42.069 --> 07:45.939
you made

07:43.300 --> 07:48.490
let's just say that desires no longer

07:45.939 --> 07:50.050
from afar she's moving in closer

07:48.490 --> 07:53.319
how well-known won't stand for that

07:50.050 --> 08:08.030
right sean has the will power and

07:53.319 --> 08:10.310
self-control to resist color

08:08.029 --> 08:13.279
colorful you know we did this to

08:10.310 --> 08:14.689
ourselves women thought to be treated as

08:13.279 --> 08:16.819
equals and now

08:14.689 --> 08:19.160
shame on us we're being treated as

08:16.819 --> 08:20.750
equals what's their fault

08:19.160 --> 08:22.760
what we did here in the training center

08:20.750 --> 08:24.560
we've allowed ourselves to become part

08:22.759 --> 08:25.490
of the woodwork paddleboards up against

08:24.560 --> 08:27.350
the wall

08:25.490 --> 08:30.829
I'm having them as much a part of this

08:27.350 --> 08:34.250
team now has anyone all teammates yeah

08:30.829 --> 08:37.039
one of the guys not exactly one of the

08:34.250 --> 08:39.950
guys come on that's how they treat us

08:37.039 --> 08:42.110
which is pretty incredible considering

08:39.950 --> 08:45.020
we walk around in swimsuits all day

08:42.110 --> 08:46.730
what is your point we've lost our

08:45.019 --> 08:49.039
femininity to make it more comfortable

08:46.730 --> 08:52.250
for them like that

08:49.039 --> 08:54.289
good how come Sean ignore a woman like

08:52.250 --> 08:56.210
you how we can think your only interest

08:54.289 --> 08:58.279
is in feeding him or making sure his

08:56.210 --> 09:00.350
skin doesn't crack and peel that's all I

08:58.279 --> 09:01.189
was doing who wait a minute am I missing

09:00.350 --> 09:03.649
something

09:01.190 --> 09:05.180
Ali Cohen made a big move on Sean and he

09:03.649 --> 09:08.299
didn't even know it was completely

09:05.179 --> 09:12.849
unaware she has the hots for you could

09:08.299 --> 09:16.059
you really have the hots for Sean

09:12.850 --> 09:19.000
echo it's just us girls well I didn't

09:16.059 --> 09:22.778
expect a little more reaction to come up

09:19.000 --> 09:26.049
sean kelly is everything that I wanted

09:22.778 --> 09:29.889
him and just another day came out of the

09:26.049 --> 09:33.250
water just looked so sexy

09:29.889 --> 09:36.639
Ellie come on don't tell me you haven't

09:33.250 --> 09:38.169
noticed of course I have but i have to

09:36.639 --> 09:41.139
put those thoughts out of my mind for

09:38.169 --> 09:42.068
the good of the team and I guess I

09:41.139 --> 09:46.089
should too

09:42.068 --> 09:47.889
wait a minute why Sean and you those

09:46.089 --> 09:50.829
guys and us are perfect for each other

09:47.889 --> 09:52.839
we have everything in common the water a

09:50.828 --> 09:54.939
commitment to saving people we take the

09:52.839 --> 09:57.310
same risks often feel the same emotions

09:54.940 --> 09:59.740
were in great physical shape that is all

09:57.309 --> 10:02.500
true but there is a time and a place for

09:59.740 --> 10:03.818
everything fine it doesn't mean I have

10:02.500 --> 10:06.610
to stay in the woodwork

10:03.818 --> 10:08.409

22:16.929 --> 22:21.669
little problem i'm sure you'll figure it

out that's that's what you do

22:21.669 --> 22:29.590
I'll see you Jason I could use your

22:26.230 --> 22:35.470
advice about something

22:29.589 --> 22:41.109
my advice yeah yeah and the situation

22:35.470 --> 22:44.589
and

22:41.109 --> 22:46.928
we it'sit's are women

22:44.589 --> 22:50.259
well first of all there's no such

22:46.929 --> 22:55.720
animals when I mean you can generalize

22:50.259 --> 22:57.129
about horses or maybe even cats so the

22:55.720 --> 23:01.430
problem is not one of the problems in

22:57.130 --> 23:06.830
the woman

23:01.430 --> 23:08.660
Keiko how did you know and what is

23:06.829 --> 23:13.269
coming onto and you wanted to stop

23:08.660 --> 23:19.750
yeah yeah exactly

23:13.269 --> 23:20.889
here it is you john monroe you like

23:19.750 --> 23:22.750
categories

23:20.890 --> 23:28.090
I mean it makes you a deal with things

23:22.750 --> 23:31.900
easier for instance team hazards victims

23:28.089 --> 23:33.970
men women children strong that makes you

23:31.900 --> 23:37.570
put kekoa Jesse alley and on the

23:33.970 --> 23:40.360
categories in first like our teammates

23:37.569 --> 23:43.450
that's right oh that's wrong they're

23:40.359 --> 23:47.589
also female you don't seem as female

23:43.450 --> 23:49.600
maybe because you're worried that one or
