IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING

09:49.050 --> 09:50.517
THAT THE VICTIM
WAS SHOT OFF HIS HORSE

WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS
OUR ATTENTIONS HERE

10:01.000 --> 10:02.058
ON THE OPPOSITE BANK,

RIPPING THROUGH

10:16.910 --> 10:19.970
IN THROUGH THE FRONT,
OUT THROUGH THE BACK,

10:20.020 --> 10:21.419

GEORGE,
I HATE TO SAY THIS,

17:32.880 --> 17:34.017
BUT YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

17:34.050 --> 17:35.517
FOR THE MURDER
OF NELSON POE.

17:35.550 --> 17:36.642
WHAT?

17:36.680 --> 17:37.749
ON WHAT GROUNDS?

17:37.790 --> 17:39.246
YOU SAID IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT.

17:39.290 --> 17:40.257
WE DISCOVERED
A STACK OF LOVE LETTERS

17:40.290 --> 17:41.257
AT NELSON'S HOUSE,

17:41.290 --> 17:42.257
INDICATING HE WAS HAVING

17:42.290 --> 17:43.427
AN AFFAIR
WITH YOUR WIFE,

17:43.460 --> 17:45.485
AND THAT YOU'D
THREATENED TO KILL HIM.

17:45.530 --> 17:47.691
OH, COME ON.

17:47.730 --> 17:49.698
I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.520
[CLATTERS]

17:53.970 --> 17:55.460
ALL RIGHT. OKAY, OKAY.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.933
[MUMBLING]

18:01.480 --> 18:02.936
WHAT DID HE SAY?

18:02.980 --> 18:06.370
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG MAN.

18:09.720 --> 18:10.789
FIRST...

18:10.820 --> 18:12.117
I TOLD YOU SO.

18:12.150 --> 18:13.708
SECONDLY, I THINK
GEORGE CHESLOW

18:13.760 --> 18:15.011
IS AN INNOCENT MAN.

18:15.060 --> 18:16.152
YEAH, YOU KNOW, HE'S RIGHT.

18:16.190 --> 18:17.327
WE DO HAVE A PAPER-THIN CASE.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.622
I MEAN, ALL WE'VE GOT

18:18.660 --> 18:19.922
IS MOTIVE, MEANS,
AND OPPORTUNITY.

18:19.960 --> 18:20.927
LOOK, GUYS,

18:20.960 --> 18:22.825
I HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT.

18:22.860 --> 18:25.260
I WAS SIPPING ICE WINE
WITH A BABY TREE MONKEY,

18:25.300 --> 18:27.734
THEN I FELL,
AND I LANDED IN A WOODED AREA,

18:27.770 --> 18:30.830
AND THAT'S WHERE I SAW
NELSON POE GET SHOT,

18:30.870 --> 18:32.599
ONLY IN MY DREAM,

18:32.640 --> 18:36.508
THE SHOOTER WAS MUCH CLOSER
THAN I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

18:36.540 --> 18:37.905
THIS IS A MINIE BALL.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.076
AM I RIGHT?

18:39.110 --> 18:40.179
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.073
YOUR DESK.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.872
NOW, IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE

18:42.920 --> 18:45.946
THAT MINIE BALLS CAUSE HUGE,
GAPING HOLES IN HUMAN FLESH,

18:45.990 --> 18:46.843
WHICH LEADS
TO A QUAN DARY

18:46.890 --> 18:47.879
IN MY DREAM.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.979
WHY WAS
NELSON POE'S EXIT WOUND...

18:50.020 --> 18:51.829
SO SMALL?

18:51.860 --> 18:53.623
IF GEORGE CHESLOW

18:53.660 --> 18:55.321
HAD BEEN
IN THAT WOODED AREA,

18:55.360 --> 18:57.692
HE WAS WAY TOO FAR
TO MAKE A SHOT

18:57.730 --> 18:59.163
THAT CAUSED SUCH A LITTLE HOLE.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.863
WHOEVER SHOT NELSON
WAS MUCH, MUCH CLOSER.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.061
AND THIS "WHOEVER" WOULD BE...

19:05.110 --> 19:07.305
ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK?

19:07.340 --> 19:08.671
SO YOU'VE GOT NOTHING.

19:08.710 --> 19:10.132
THANK YOU
FOR THE RANDOM SPECULATION.

19:10.180 --> 19:11.442
GOODBYE.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.640
MR. SPENCER,
IF YOU CAN'T NAME NAMES,

19:12.680 --> 19:14.170
I'M AFRAID HE'S RIGHT
THIS TIME.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.244
FINE.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.872
I'LL GET YOU A NAME...

19:17.990 --> 19:19.514
AND I'M GOING TO
GET YOU A WOMAN.

19:22.020 --> 19:24.659
"AFRAID" HE'S RIGHT?

19:24.690 --> 19:26.988
"THIS TIME"?

19:28.560 --> 19:29.857
ACTUALLY,
IT'S A GIFT,

19:29.900 --> 19:30.992
FOR MY SON.

19:31.030 --> 19:32.258
A SURPRISE OF SORTS.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.291
THIS WAY, HE,
MY SON,

19:34.340 --> 19:35.796
WILL BE ABLE
TO KEEP TRACK OF TIME

19:35.840 --> 19:37.307
FOR A CHANGE.

19:37.340 --> 19:38.705
KID WAS LATE AT BIRTH.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.207
HE'S BEEN LATE
EVER SINCE.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.174
NOW HE IS GOING TO HAVE

19:42.210 --> 19:45.373
A GOLD POCKET WATCH
JUST LIKE MINE.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.617
I'VE HAD MINE FOR 30 YEARS.

19:47.650 --> 19:48.742
I SEE.

19:48.780 --> 19:49.940
NOW, THE INSCRIPTION...

19:49.980 --> 19:51.186
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE IT TO SAY?

19:51.220 --> 19:53.859
"SHAWN," UH...

19:53.890 --> 19:55.482
"DON'T LOSE THIS WATCH.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.249

19:57.290 --> 19:59.622
"SPENCER"--

20:00.700 --> 20:01.951
WHAT? TOO MUCH?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.149
N-NO.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.259
IT'S JUST THAT YOUR SON
IS NO DOUBT FAMILIAR

20:05.300 --> 20:06.790
WITH YOUR LAST NAME.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.388
IT MIGHT...

20:08.440 --> 20:10.135
CONTRADICT
TH E SENTIM ENT.

20:10.170 --> 20:11.808
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST?

20:11.840 --> 20:12.909
UH...

20:12.940 --> 20:15.272
"LOVE, DAD"?

20:15.310 --> 20:16.402
[LAUGHS]

20:16.440 --> 20:17.976
"LOVE, DAD"?

20:18.010 --> 20:20.103
YEAH, WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST PUT "KISSY, KISSY"?

20:20.150 --> 20:21.617
RIGHT. TOO MUSHY.

20:21.650 --> 20:22.912
NO PROBLEM.

20:22.950 --> 20:24.417

WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

20:35.130 --> 20:36.427
WHAT ABOUT MY DISCOUNT?

20:36.460 --> 20:37.825
I'M EX-COP.
HALF THE REGIMENT'S COP.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.964
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
ON 400 BUCKS.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.137
YES, WE DID, BUT...

20:42.170 --> 20:43.467
AT FOUR DOLLARS
PER ENGRAVED LETTER,

20:43.510 --> 20:46.468
THAT ADDS A TOTAL OF...

20:53.280 --> 20:54.577
HOW MUCH DOES THAT COME OUT TO?

20:55.820 --> 20:57.640

22:19.870 --> 22:21.531

22:21.570 --> 22:23.731

22:24.910 --> 22:26.730
I WAS THINKING DENZEL.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.601
DID YOU JUST SAY "DENZEL"?

22:30.650 --> 22:31.947
AS IN DENZEL WASHINGTON?

22:31.980 --> 22:33.004
NO, THE OTHER DENZEL.

22:33.050 --> 22:34.039
OF COURSE...

22:34.080 --> 22:35.877
AND WE WILL PUT YOU
ON A HORSE,

22:35.920 --> 22:37.717
AND WE WILL GIVE YOU
YOUR OWN SWORD...

22:39.120 --> 22:40.587
AND YOU WILL HAVE
A CHESTFUL OF MEDALS.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.087
YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT.
YOU CAN BE A PILOT.

22:43.460 --> 22:45.485
THE AIR FORCE WASN'T FORMED
UNTIL WORLD WAR I.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.781
THAT'S FAIR.

22:46.830 --> 22:48.821
