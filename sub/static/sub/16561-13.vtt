WEBVTT

00:02.985 --> 00:03.852
Dr. Latham.

00:03.888 --> 00:05.788
Dr. Rhodes. Light day today.
Doh!

00:05.823 --> 00:09.024
That's good, 'cause we just
got a call from mercy hospital.

00:09.060 --> 00:10.159
Over in rock island.

00:10.194 --> 00:14.130
They have a young woman with
a type a aortic dissection.

00:14.165 --> 00:16.699
Who needs a valve-sparing
root replacement.

00:16.734 --> 00:18.801
Rare, difficult procedure.

00:18.836 --> 00:20.703
And none of the surgeons there.

00:20.738 --> 00:21.904
Have any experience with it.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.873
Have the air ambulance
bring her in,

00:23.908 --> 00:25.074
And I'll clear an or.

00:25.109 --> 00:25.941
I'm afraid we can't.

00:25.977 --> 00:27.810
She's multi-trauma
from a car accident,

00:27.845 --> 00:29.211
And she's too unstable
to travel.

00:29.247 --> 00:30.824
Then they'll have to perform
a standard repair.

00:30.848 --> 00:33.015
Dr. Latham, I...
I do not like to travel.

00:34.218 --> 00:36.819
I can understand that
given your situation...

00:36.854 --> 00:38.854
You can say it. My asperger's.

00:41.726 --> 00:44.660
Dr. Latham, these cases
are indeed rare.

00:44.695 --> 00:46.996
And while I have assisted you
on one before,

00:47.031 --> 00:50.766
I would like to be able to say
I have done one running lead.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.768
Now, it's only
a 20-minute chopper flight,

00:52.803 --> 00:54.443
And we don't even have
to spend the night.

00:56.941 --> 00:58.841
This is important to you.

00:58.876 --> 01:00.876
It is.

01:00.912 --> 01:04.046
Perhaps I shouldn't be so rigid.

01:04.081 --> 01:06.749
A broadening experience
might do me good.

01:10.454 --> 01:12.288
All right, dr. Rhodes.

01:12.323 --> 01:13.889
You'll get your procedure.

01:13.925 --> 01:16.258
We'll even spend the night.

01:16.294 --> 01:17.760
A hotel...

01:17.795 --> 01:20.229
Gonna be interesting.

01:22.066 --> 01:23.165
I'll let them know.

01:28.906 --> 01:30.384
More like five under.
It was ten under.

01:30.408 --> 01:31.451
I just like to be careful, okay?

01:31.475 --> 01:32.475
I have a history.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.376
Hey, guys.

01:34.412 --> 01:36.879
Morning. Hey.

01:36.914 --> 01:38.113
That a new stethoscope?

01:38.149 --> 01:39.882
Yeah.

01:39.917 --> 01:42.084
Owen got a hold
of the last one, so...

01:42.119 --> 01:45.387
Hey, those stuffed animals are
not gonna diagnose themselves.

01:49.493 --> 01:51.961
All right, blondie.

01:51.996 --> 01:54.396
Coffee later? You got it, red.

01:55.933 --> 01:58.834
Have a good day.

01:58.869 --> 02:01.170
Hey, babe.
You forgot your lunch.

02:01.205 --> 02:04.473
Tate, I could've
gotten something here.

02:04.508 --> 02:07.142
Potato chips, pickles,
and a zagnut bar?

02:07.178 --> 02:08.911
Pregnant ladies get
to pretty much eat.

02:08.946 --> 02:10.079
Anything they want?

02:10.114 --> 02:12.114
<i>We could fill you with
a gallon of hormones,</i>

02:12.149 --> 02:13.816
Then analyze your diet.

02:15.152 --> 02:16.552
Enjoy your lunch.

02:19.156 --> 02:19.955
Thank you. You're welcome.

02:19.991 --> 02:21.924
Incoming, dr. Manning.
Treatment 2.

02:21.959 --> 02:24.260
Got it.

02:24.295 --> 02:25.761
Gabe moor, eight years old,

02:25.796 --> 02:27.174
With advanced
non-hodgkin's lymphoma,

02:27.198 --> 02:29.265
Found seizing at home, temp 104.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.267
One milligram of versed
in the field.

02:31.302 --> 02:33.769
All right, hang in there, okay?

02:33.804 --> 02:35.070
All right, on my count.

02:37.241 --> 02:40.376
One, two, three.

02:40.411 --> 02:42.444
All right, get this
out of here please.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.513
Compression bags.

02:47.485 --> 02:49.118
Equal and reactive to light.

02:51.188 --> 02:52.554
Does he see oncology here?

02:52.590 --> 02:54.023
Yeah, dr. Hurwitz.

02:54.058 --> 02:55.291
Get his current med list.

02:55.326 --> 02:57.126
And give a dose of vanco
and ceftriaxone.

02:57.161 --> 02:59.795
Vanco and ceftriaxone, got it.

02:59.830 --> 03:01.141
Does he have a mother
we should call?

03:01.165 --> 03:02.365
She passed when he was a baby.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.866
Okay.

03:03.901 --> 03:05.467
Dad? I'm right here.

03:05.503 --> 03:07.836
These doctors are gonna
take good care of you.

03:09.907 --> 03:10.973
He's seizing!

03:11.008 --> 03:13.242
Give one of ativan,
push 500 milligrams dilantin.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.209
My god.

03:14.245 --> 03:17.479
Let's get some labs, cbc,
cmp, ct head,

03:17.515 --> 03:19.848
Blood cultures, and an eeg.

03:19.884 --> 03:21.128
The seizure may be
caused by his fever.

03:21.152 --> 03:25.020
However, it is possible that the
cancer's spread to his brain.

03:25.056 --> 03:26.366
When was his last scan?
Couple of months ago.

03:26.390 --> 03:28.157
Let's get an infused mri.

03:28.192 --> 03:30.159
I just want to see if
the cancer's spread, okay?

03:30.194 --> 03:32.227
Okay.

03:33.364 --> 03:35.931
Dr. Manning? Yeah.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.199
Excuse me, please.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.236
I just called the pharmacy.

03:41.272 --> 03:43.939
Dad hasn't filled gabe's chemo
in three months.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.341
He's withholding his medication.

03:45.376 --> 03:47.009
Maybe he filled it
someplace else?

03:47.044 --> 03:48.588
His oncologist ordered
straight through the hospital.

03:48.612 --> 03:50.913
No other way to get it.

03:50.948 --> 03:53.082
He's just waiting
for his son to die?

03:55.000 --> 04:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:08.773 --> 04:09.950
Nothing artificial. We are aware
that your son was prescribed.

04:09.974 --> 04:12.642
A new oral chemo, and that you
have been withholding it.

04:12.677 --> 04:14.143
I'm not "withholding" them.

04:14.179 --> 04:16.212
I understand that you're
a single father.

04:16.247 --> 04:18.481
And that this must be
incredibly hard for you...

04:18.516 --> 04:19.415
It's not about me.

04:19.451 --> 04:21.817
But if you are willingly
keeping your son.

04:21.853 --> 04:22.819
Off of his meds, then we...

04:22.854 --> 04:24.887
It's his decision.

04:26.324 --> 04:27.457
Excuse me?

04:27.492 --> 04:28.891
Gabe's.

04:28.927 --> 04:30.827
He's been through
four courses of chemo.

04:30.862 --> 04:32.428
The nausea, the pain,

04:32.464 --> 04:34.330
The drugs to treat
the nausea and the pain...

04:34.365 --> 04:35.365
It was awful.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.400
That doesn't mean you can
just stop trying.

04:37.435 --> 04:39.335
He begged me all
through the last course.

04:39.370 --> 04:40.670
But I wouldn't stop it.

04:40.705 --> 04:42.738
And it didn't help at all.

04:42.774 --> 04:44.507
None of them helped.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.309
So this time, I let him decide.

04:46.344 --> 04:48.177
He can't decide.

04:48.213 --> 04:49.846
He's eight years old, okay?

04:49.881 --> 04:52.515
His brain is literally
not developed enough.

04:52.550 --> 04:53.683
To process this.

04:53.718 --> 04:56.519
Life and death and forever
are concepts.

04:56.554 --> 04:58.421
That he cannot fully
understand yet.

04:58.456 --> 05:00.556
Gabe does understand.

05:01.693 --> 05:03.459
I'm sorry,

05:03.495 --> 05:05.595
But we need to start your son
on his new chemo.

05:05.630 --> 05:07.597
No. I won't authorize that.

05:11.035 --> 05:12.802
I will be back soon
to check on your son.

05:17.342 --> 05:20.543
Dcfs can have a court order
to start the chemo in two hours.

05:20.578 --> 05:22.445
Let's get the mri result first...

05:22.480 --> 05:23.657
See if the cancer's
spread so much.

05:23.681 --> 05:25.781
That it's no longer
even treatable.

05:32.223 --> 05:33.623
Ms. Holloway, I'm dr. Halstead.

05:33.658 --> 05:35.224
I hear you had some
trouble today.

05:35.260 --> 05:37.493
I fell down. Big deal.

05:37.529 --> 05:40.463
Well, says here your
troponin level is .08.

05:40.498 --> 05:41.675
That means you fell down because.

05:41.699 --> 05:43.666
You were having
a small heart attack.

05:43.701 --> 05:45.368
Ever had any heart
trouble before?

05:45.403 --> 05:47.703
I don't know.
I don't go to doctors.

05:47.739 --> 05:49.539
Dr. Halstead?

05:49.574 --> 05:52.308
Your blood glucose is 458.
You're diabetic?

05:52.343 --> 05:53.643
That's what they say.

05:53.678 --> 05:54.911
Let's get a vbg.

05:54.946 --> 05:56.579
Give her 10 units
of iv regular insulin.

05:56.614 --> 05:58.381
And bolus her a liter of ns.

05:58.416 --> 05:59.315
I'll call endocrine
for a consult.

05:59.350 --> 06:01.517
And let cardiology know
we're admitting her.

06:01.553 --> 06:03.386
Admitting me?

06:04.522 --> 06:05.588
Yeah, that's right.

06:05.623 --> 06:07.523
Diabetes can cause
numerous problems,

06:07.559 --> 06:09.358
Including coronary
artery disease.

06:09.394 --> 06:11.527
I want to admit you to run
a few tests on your heart.

06:11.563 --> 06:13.863
And more importantly,
get your diabetes under control.

06:13.898 --> 06:15.765
Nope. Not gonna happen.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.866
Why is that?

06:16.901 --> 06:18.601
Are you gonna feed
zachary taylor.

06:18.636 --> 06:20.603
And millard fillmore?

06:20.638 --> 06:21.604
I'm sorry?

06:21.639 --> 06:22.471
My cats.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.874
Named after the first
12 presidents.

06:26.711 --> 06:27.922
Let's start getting
your sugar down,

06:27.946 --> 06:29.679
And we'll talk in a little bit.

06:31.816 --> 06:34.517
Got us a crazy cat lady.

06:36.955 --> 06:39.021
Drs. Rhodes and latham,

06:39.057 --> 06:40.022
Mayor hendrix.

06:40.058 --> 06:41.591
Call me jim.

06:41.626 --> 06:43.370
My family and I can't
thank you enough for coming.

06:43.394 --> 06:44.605
I assure you we will
do everything we can.

06:44.629 --> 06:45.461
For your daughter.

06:45.496 --> 06:46.607
If there's anything
that you need,

06:46.631 --> 06:47.641
Please let bob or me know.

06:47.665 --> 06:48.898
We will. Thank you.

06:51.769 --> 06:54.737
Must be hard staying upbeat
under such trying circumstances.

06:54.772 --> 06:56.105
Guess if you're a politician,

06:56.140 --> 06:58.507
It's expected.

07:06.651 --> 07:08.651
Tough case?

07:08.686 --> 07:11.487
Kids get sick.
I understand that.

07:11.522 --> 07:14.724
But seeing what their
parents do to them...

07:14.759 --> 07:16.792
That drives me nuts.

07:18.096 --> 07:19.395
Yeah.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.633
Coffee time?

07:23.668 --> 07:24.834
That's right.

07:24.869 --> 07:26.469
I'm sorry.

07:26.504 --> 07:27.470
I'm swamped.

07:27.505 --> 07:28.671
No problem.

07:28.706 --> 07:30.640
Lunch maybe.

07:30.675 --> 07:32.008
Absolutely. Okay.

07:32.043 --> 07:33.876
Hey, will? Yeah?

07:36.447 --> 07:39.448
Did you and natalie
ever have a thing?

07:40.485 --> 07:42.952
What?

07:42.987 --> 07:44.754
Natalie and me? No.

07:44.789 --> 07:46.656
I mean, we're good friends,
and, you know,

07:46.691 --> 07:50.026
She's a great doctor, but we
never dated or anything.

07:50.061 --> 07:52.628
Okay.

07:52.664 --> 07:54.697
Besides, who cares?

07:54.732 --> 07:56.543
The only person in the world
I have a thing for right now.

07:56.567 --> 07:58.067
Is you.

07:59.671 --> 08:01.737
You're such a charmer.

08:08.746 --> 08:11.013
You saw ms. Holloway?
Yep, thanks for the heads-up.

08:12.116 --> 08:14.817
Diabetes studies keep
the lights on upstairs.

08:14.852 --> 08:16.619
Glad I could help.

08:16.654 --> 08:18.187
That's odd.

08:18.222 --> 08:19.722
She was an architect.

08:19.757 --> 08:21.657
Why is that odd?

08:21.693 --> 08:24.060
Well, her hemoglobin a1c
and lipid panel indicate.

08:24.095 --> 08:26.529
She takes extremely
poor care of herself.

08:26.564 --> 08:27.841
You know, it seems out
of character for someone

08:27.865 --> 08:29.865
I assume pays great
attention to detail.

08:29.901 --> 08:31.801
Slow day for head-shrinkers
around here.

08:31.836 --> 08:33.202
You want me to have a chat?

08:33.236 --> 08:35.171
Sure, knock yourself out.

08:35.206 --> 08:36.871
Shoot me her chart. Sure.

08:39.711 --> 08:42.611
Hello there, mrs. Holloway.

08:44.782 --> 08:46.982
Well, hello there.

08:49.954 --> 08:51.821
He's breathing so hard.

08:53.591 --> 08:55.224
He's septic.

08:55.259 --> 08:58.761
We need to give
the antibiotics time.

08:58.796 --> 09:01.564
He'd scream out in his sleep
when it first started...

09:01.599 --> 09:03.232
And get these pains.

09:03.267 --> 09:05.701
But he kept on fighting.

09:05.737 --> 09:07.770
I quit my job
to take care of him.

09:07.805 --> 09:10.039
Then help him keep fighting.

09:10.074 --> 09:13.843
Tell him that there's a chance
this new chemo could work.

09:13.878 --> 09:15.778
Look at him.

09:15.813 --> 09:18.180
He's not fighting anymore.

09:18.216 --> 09:20.583
He's done.

09:20.618 --> 09:23.018
And I will not flog him
against his wishes.

09:24.489 --> 09:26.856
My boy deserves
better than that.

09:29.660 --> 09:31.026
Incoming trauma. Dr. Choi.

09:31.062 --> 09:32.062
We're going to 2.

09:32.096 --> 09:33.863
Grace snow, 26.

09:33.898 --> 09:35.598
Driver in a two-car mvc.

09:35.633 --> 09:36.565
Found hypotensive
and tachypneic,

09:36.601 --> 09:38.801
But responded to a liter bolus
on the ride.

09:38.836 --> 09:41.137
I'm dr. Choi.
You're at chicago med.

09:41.172 --> 09:42.872
Let's transfer.

09:44.809 --> 09:45.975
On my count. Ready?

09:46.010 --> 09:47.676
One, two, three.

09:48.946 --> 09:51.080
Grace, does any of this hurt?

09:51.115 --> 09:53.649
Let's get trauma labs,
blood gas, and a pan scan.

09:53.684 --> 09:55.217
Becca... What?

09:55.253 --> 09:57.219
Becca... Driving crazy.

09:57.255 --> 09:58.966
Courtney, I thought this woman
was the driver.

09:58.990 --> 10:00.790
They said she was.

10:00.825 --> 10:02.258
I'm her husband. What happened?

10:02.293 --> 10:03.559
She was in a car accident.

10:03.594 --> 10:04.994
My god, grace, are you okay?

10:05.029 --> 10:07.830
Crashed the car...

10:07.865 --> 10:09.899
Possibly some small fluid
in morrison's pouch.

10:09.934 --> 10:11.801
Since vitals are stable,
let's get a pan scan.

10:11.836 --> 10:12.635
She keeps mentioning becca.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.637
Was there someone else
in the car?

10:14.672 --> 10:16.005
I don't know.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.908
Does she know
someone named becca?

10:18.943 --> 10:19.909
If there's another victim
still out there,

10:19.944 --> 10:22.011
We need to find her.

10:22.046 --> 10:22.912
Maggie, call p.D.

10:22.947 --> 10:24.780
Might be another injury
in the field.

10:24.816 --> 10:26.126
Wait, wait.
There's no other victim.

10:26.150 --> 10:29.318
Becca is grace's tulpa.

10:29.353 --> 10:31.821
Her what?

10:31.856 --> 10:35.825
A... Sentient being that
lives inside her body.

10:37.895 --> 10:40.596
Becca is grace's tulpa.

10:49.715 --> 10:50.882
I created her.

10:50.917 --> 10:54.819
You created becca?
It's how tulpas work.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.921
First you start with
an image in your mind.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.791
Of a person or a character
you might like.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.460
Then you spend some
time with her each day.

11:02.496 --> 11:06.464
Eventually, she takes on
a personality of her own.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.799
She becomes three-dimensional.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.802
That's interesting.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.277
So how do you know
what becca thinks?

11:12.305 --> 11:13.738
I talk to her.

11:13.774 --> 11:14.539
It's tricky at first.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.641
She likes to stay
in the background.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.910
But likely she's been
fronting more and more.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.245
Fronting?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.814
Taking over my body...

11:22.849 --> 11:26.284
My muscles, my eyes.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.154
Wasn't always easy, giving over
total control like that.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.656
But you get used to it.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.759
There's a website that
teaches you how.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.795
So is... is that what
happened today in the car?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.263
Yeah. Okay.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.131
I let her drive.
I shouldn't have.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.834
She's not very good at it.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.837
We got into an argument,
and she got upset.

11:45.872 --> 11:46.771
And lost control.

11:46.807 --> 11:50.675
Which is why we decided
that you, grace,

11:50.711 --> 11:53.778
Wouldn't see her anymore. Right?

11:56.349 --> 11:57.882
Right.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.851
They're ready for mrs. Scott
in ct.

11:59.886 --> 12:03.722
Okay, well, very nice
to meet you, grace.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.957
Um, we hope that both
you and becca.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.325
Are feeling better soon.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.063
As long as the scans
are negative,

12:12.099 --> 12:13.298
I'll observe for a few hours.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.033
Then you can admit her to psych.

12:16.269 --> 12:20.205
Differential's long.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.141
Could be dissociative
identity disorder,

12:23.176 --> 12:24.676
Schizophrenia...

12:24.711 --> 12:25.822
Or it could just be a tulpa.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.880
I mean, I'm not ruling out any
of that other stuff yet,

12:28.915 --> 12:30.548
But until we see signs
of impairment,

12:30.584 --> 12:32.684
We have to consider
the possibility that.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.719
She really could've created
an alter ego.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.721
That she believes
cohabits her body.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.723
But tulpas aren't in the dsm.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.091
So what?

12:40.127 --> 12:42.894
She's clearly disturbed.
We need a diagnosis.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.596
Well, it's challenging.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.931
And I look forward to seeing
where you land.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.001
Hey, I just got off the phone
with p.D.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.337
They've got several eyewitness
accounts of the accident,

12:52.372 --> 12:53.938
Saying that your patient
accelerated.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.608
Directly into traffic.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.376
They think it was
a suicide attempt.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.714
Just got a little
more complicated.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.252
Graft is in.
Let's re-implant the coronaries.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.953
We'll do the left
coronary first,

13:08.989 --> 13:10.099
Due to its anterior location.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.891
How far do you prefer to
dissect for implantation?

13:12.926 --> 13:14.926
Five or six centimeters.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.361
Even when it's a little shorter,

13:16.396 --> 13:18.096
There could some tension.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.365
That rarely becomes problematic.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.701
Though kessler et al did
report pseudo-aneurysm formation.

13:23.737 --> 13:26.638
In 20% of implants
under tension.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.973
Which we can avoid
with added dissection.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.075
So you'd prefer to risk
a branch injury.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.877
And possibly force
a double bypass?

13:32.913 --> 13:34.946
No.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.115
I believe dr. Rhodes
means we can do a cabrol.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.984
Attach an 8-millimeter woven
graft to the left coronary.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.920
In order to ease the tension.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.121
Am I correct, dr. Rhodes?

13:44.991 --> 13:48.059
Yes. Yes, that is
what we should do.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.094
Open an 8-millimeter
woven graft.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.068
What's the verdict?

13:57.103 --> 13:58.803
Definitely in the red.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.138
On the old eccentricity meter,

14:00.173 --> 14:02.140
But not really any
alarm bells to speak of.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.141
So we can't hold her?

14:03.176 --> 14:05.310
Not if she wants to go.
Totally her call.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.078
Figured. Thanks.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.092
You know, it used to be
if a doctor told a patient.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.350
To do something,
they just did it.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.819
You been binging on "dr.
Quinn, medicine woman" again?

14:14.855 --> 14:16.988
I'm just saying,
things were different.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.858
Like, guys didn't need to tell
women every single thing.

14:19.893 --> 14:20.859
They were feeling.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.827
My father never did.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.929
Are we still talking
about diabetes?

14:27.334 --> 14:29.801
Brought the rest of that
assessment for you to fill out.

14:29.836 --> 14:32.470
Can I ask you,
that handsome doctor...

14:32.505 --> 14:34.205
Is he seeing anyone?

14:34.241 --> 14:36.841
Dr. Halstead?

14:36.877 --> 14:38.109
Actually, I believe he is.

14:38.144 --> 14:39.878
Not the one with the hair.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.180
The big one in the vest.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.183
Dr. Charles?

14:46.319 --> 14:48.086
Actually, I have no idea.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.864
Hey, buddy. Where's your dad?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.400
He went to the bathroom.

15:02.435 --> 15:05.303
Can I go home? Not yet.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.038
We're still working
on your fever.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.073
Okay.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.909
You like video games?

15:10.944 --> 15:13.177
Yeah, I do.

15:14.915 --> 15:18.750
So you know when
your character dies.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.852
And a game ends,

15:20.887 --> 15:24.222
You can just start over
and play again?

15:26.226 --> 15:28.526
Okay, well, when people die,

15:28.561 --> 15:30.395
It's different.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.397
There are no do-overs.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.999
You can't just start a new game.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.002
I know.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.204
You don't think or do anything,

15:40.240 --> 15:42.540
Because you're not here anymore,

15:42.575 --> 15:45.076
Like my mom.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.244
Right.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.781
So if you only have one chance,

15:49.816 --> 15:52.016
Wouldn't you want
to fight like crazy.

15:52.052 --> 15:56.020
To keep going for
as long as you can?

15:56.056 --> 15:58.022
I did, but...

15:58.058 --> 15:59.557
Nothing worked.

15:59.592 --> 16:02.160
It just hurt a lot.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.964
I know.

16:05.999 --> 16:10.368
Gabe... We want to be able
to give you a new medicine.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.806
And I'm afraid if
you don't take it,

16:14.841 --> 16:16.407
You are gonna die.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.878
And I don't want that.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.148
Thank you.

16:24.184 --> 16:27.218
But everybody has
their time to live.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.355
I've had mine.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.392
I want to see what's next.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.443
Grace, I'm sorry,
but we have to ask you...

16:52.479 --> 16:54.445
Did you try
to kill yourself today?

16:56.282 --> 16:58.216
What? No.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.587
You said before that
you and becca.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.288
Were having an argument.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.424
What was that about? Nothing.

17:06.459 --> 17:10.161
She just gets upset
with me sometimes.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.497
Upset? Not upset, just...

17:12.531 --> 17:16.334
Like, she doesn't understand
how I could love someone.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.270
Who wants to keep us apart.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.339
I imagine that'd
be hard for her.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.275
It is.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.410
Really is.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.190
I mean, she's my best friend.

17:28.214 --> 17:32.316
Why should I have
to stop seeing her?

17:32.352 --> 17:36.354
I don't always...
Connect with other people.

17:36.389 --> 17:40.158
So when there's one person
you can talk to.

17:40.193 --> 17:43.628
And be yourself with who
isn't gonna judge you.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.030
Or hurt your feelings...

17:46.066 --> 17:49.434
Knowing I have a really good
friend should make mark happy.

17:51.004 --> 17:54.305
But it doesn't.
I don't understand why.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.340
Grace, are you sure that.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.342
You weren't trying
to end your life today?

17:58.378 --> 18:00.445
No.

18:03.349 --> 18:06.918
I don't know. Maybe.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.319
I just... I don't know.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.399
Put her on a five-day hold?

18:21.434 --> 18:22.934
Yeah. Poor woman.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.669
At least we can narrow it down.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.270
To something psychiatric.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.239
Maybe put her on a trial
of antipsychotics?

18:28.274 --> 18:31.042
I don't know.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.044
Becca tried to kill grace.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.212
Yeah, but let's not forget,

18:34.247 --> 18:36.214
<i>Becca is grace.</i>

18:36.249 --> 18:38.683
I mean, we might yet find
that she's psychotic,

18:38.718 --> 18:40.918
But she could also just be...

18:40.954 --> 18:43.421
Cracking under the pressure
of forcibly being cut off.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.355
From a part of herself.

18:44.390 --> 18:47.258
Wait, you don't think
she is actually.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.226
Within the bounds
of functionality?

18:48.261 --> 18:50.228
I think we need more
information, don't you?

18:50.263 --> 18:53.431
Grab me when her
husband gets back.

18:53.466 --> 18:57.268
I think it might be time
for us all to, um...

18:57.303 --> 18:59.504
To meet becca.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.244
St elevations...
She's having an mi!

19:06.279 --> 19:08.719
Give her an aspirin, nitro, and
push 5 milligrams of morphine.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.048
What can I do?
Get her on 10 liters of o2.

19:11.084 --> 19:12.950
Lydia, we're gonna
get you through this.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.685
Stay with me.
Lydia, lift your tongue up.

19:18.424 --> 19:19.468
Morphine's in.
Send another troponin.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.958
And get a 12-lead.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.471
Ms. Holloway, you just had
another heart attack.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.128
I need to get you
up for angiography.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.130
And probably a stent right now,
do you understand?

19:26.166 --> 19:27.498
Yes. Good.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.133
But I'm not doing it.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.269
I told you, I'm going home
to my cats.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.515
Maybe I have not
been clear enough...

19:32.539 --> 19:34.272
How many cats?

19:34.307 --> 19:36.607
Twelve.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.142
Draw a red top tube as well.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.277
Give me a few minutes.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.445
I think we might've found
a reason for her to stay.

19:49.046 --> 19:50.156
Thanks for not letting medid
look like an idiot. Tree.

19:50.180 --> 19:52.981
No need to thank me.
Still, I appreciate it.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.750
I always thought that
needing to be rescued.

19:54.785 --> 19:55.884
Was a sign of weakness.

19:55.919 --> 19:58.887
I'm starting to see it's more
complicated than that.

20:00.724 --> 20:02.824
Dr. Latham!

20:02.860 --> 20:04.893
So glad you could join us.

20:04.928 --> 20:06.495
Now, we may not be chicago,

20:06.530 --> 20:08.997
But I bet you guys have
never had a wicked sidecar.

20:09.033 --> 20:12.100
Inside a hundred-foot rock dome.

20:12.136 --> 20:13.869
Um, no. Come on.

20:13.904 --> 20:16.204
Dr. Rhodes, mike evans,
chamber of commerce.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.539
Hey. Pleasure to meet you.

20:17.574 --> 20:20.175
Let's get you a drink.
Absolutely.

20:20.210 --> 20:21.977
Strap yourself in.

20:25.582 --> 20:28.183
Ms. Holloway's case has.

20:28.218 --> 20:30.852
Toxoplasmosis.

20:30.888 --> 20:32.921
That's a parasite
from cat feces.

20:32.956 --> 20:34.690
Which lives in the victim's
brain forever,

20:34.725 --> 20:37.192
And in women, toxo
creates a compulsion.

20:37.227 --> 20:38.794
To take care of cats.

20:38.829 --> 20:40.762
Makes me wonder...

20:40.798 --> 20:43.465
Do cat lovers get toxoplasmosis,

20:43.500 --> 20:45.634
Or does toxo make them
cat lovers?

20:45.669 --> 20:47.602
Interesting, but not
terribly relevant.

20:47.638 --> 20:49.971
What is relevant is
its other effects on women.

20:50.007 --> 20:53.475
They become less concerned
with their own welfare.

20:53.510 --> 20:55.077
Which might be
fueling her refusal.

20:55.112 --> 20:56.611
To let us take care of her.

20:56.647 --> 20:57.813
All right.

20:57.848 --> 20:58.947
Let's go tell her.

20:58.982 --> 21:00.048
Sure you want to do that?

21:00.084 --> 21:01.983
There's a parasite in her brain.

21:02.019 --> 21:03.819
Yeah, there's no cure for toxo.

21:03.854 --> 21:05.999
You'd be giving her information
she can't do anything with.

21:06.023 --> 21:08.790
Her decision-making capability
is compromised.

21:08.826 --> 21:10.837
Knowing the truth could help
her change how she thinks.

21:10.861 --> 21:12.928
A lot easier said than done.

21:12.963 --> 21:15.964
Still, it's our responsibility
to let her decide.

21:15.999 --> 21:17.132
Fair enough.

21:17.167 --> 21:18.967
All right.

21:25.843 --> 21:28.643
So what you're saying is,

21:28.679 --> 21:30.946
I've been living alone
for ten years,

21:30.981 --> 21:33.181
Keeping to myself,

21:33.217 --> 21:34.916
All because of a parasite?

21:34.952 --> 21:36.651
It's certainly a factor.

21:36.687 --> 21:39.020
It alters your thoughts,
but it doesn't dictate them.

21:39.056 --> 21:40.789
I mean, you must have
noticed differences.

21:40.824 --> 21:42.824
From when you were younger.

21:42.860 --> 21:45.160
I used to go out more.

21:45.195 --> 21:46.161
Had more friends.

21:46.196 --> 21:49.030
Always liked to travel.

21:49.066 --> 21:51.800
But as the years went on,
I didn't really feel.

21:51.835 --> 21:53.835
Like doing those things anymore.

21:53.871 --> 21:56.138
But wouldn't it be
great if you did?

21:56.173 --> 21:58.607
Maybe.

21:58.642 --> 22:00.308
Doesn't seem so interesting now.

22:00.344 --> 22:02.210
That's it... why not?

22:02.246 --> 22:04.179
You're the same person
you used to be.

22:04.214 --> 22:05.814
Am I?

22:05.849 --> 22:07.849
You just said there's
a bug in my head.

22:07.885 --> 22:09.017
Pulling the strings.

22:09.052 --> 22:11.131
But now that you know,
you can do something about it...

22:11.155 --> 22:12.854
Make better decisions.

22:12.890 --> 22:15.023
There's no reason you can't
reach down inside.

22:15.058 --> 22:17.025
And find the person you were.

22:19.329 --> 22:20.495
I don't know.

22:20.531 --> 22:22.831
Ms. Holloway, I think
the chance to be yourself again.

22:22.866 --> 22:25.934
Is worth fighting for.

22:33.744 --> 22:35.877
See if we can get her
in the cath lab today.

22:35.913 --> 22:37.979
Sure.

22:39.716 --> 22:41.783
You okay?

22:43.787 --> 22:46.988
Nina asked if there was ever
anything between nat and me.

22:48.258 --> 22:49.324
Really?

22:49.359 --> 22:50.992
Well, technically there wasn't.

22:51.028 --> 22:52.694
I mean, we never went out.

22:54.131 --> 22:56.765
But okay, no, I wasn't
completely honest.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.901
I should... i should tell her
the truth, right?

22:59.937 --> 23:00.902
I mean, we're in a relationship.

23:00.938 --> 23:02.015
That should be built on honesty.

23:02.039 --> 23:04.906
You asking my advice?

23:04.942 --> 23:06.152
Women don't usually appreciate.

23:06.176 --> 23:10.045
Hearing about their boyfriend's
feelings for other women.

23:10.080 --> 23:11.320
But it's the right thing to do.

23:12.883 --> 23:14.916
Isn't it?

23:21.959 --> 23:24.125
Hi.

23:24.161 --> 23:27.262
Gabe's blood gases
are getting worse.

23:27.297 --> 23:29.898
We're getting to a point where
we may have to intubate.

23:29.933 --> 23:30.765
And that'll get him through.

23:30.801 --> 23:33.635
Till you get the infection
under control?

23:33.670 --> 23:36.771
The antibiotics still aren't
turning it around.

23:36.807 --> 23:39.875
And there's a very good chance
that once we intubate,

23:39.910 --> 23:42.210
We may not be able to get
the tube out again.

23:42.246 --> 23:44.746
Wait, I won't be able
to talk to him again?

23:44.781 --> 23:46.882
It's possible.

23:46.917 --> 23:48.049
I'm sorry.

23:48.085 --> 23:48.984
God.

23:49.019 --> 23:50.785
Excuse me. Yes?

23:50.821 --> 23:52.954
Dr. Manning?

23:52.990 --> 23:55.957
We're not there quite yet.

23:55.993 --> 23:57.058
I'll be back.

24:02.099 --> 24:04.900
The radiologist hasn't read
the mri yet, but I don't care.

24:04.935 --> 24:06.668
We need to get gabe that chemo.

24:06.703 --> 24:08.114
But, april, bringing in
family services...

24:08.138 --> 24:09.771
Okay, you feel for the dad.

24:09.806 --> 24:10.906
I get it.

24:10.941 --> 24:12.274
But you are gabe's doctor.

24:12.309 --> 24:14.976
And that boy understands
more about his situation.

24:15.012 --> 24:16.778
Than you think.

24:16.813 --> 24:18.980
Natalie, if you don't
call dcfs, I will.

24:23.787 --> 24:25.020
Okay.

24:25.055 --> 24:27.122
I'll talk to goodwin.

24:31.862 --> 24:32.794
You can see it on their website.

24:32.829 --> 24:35.697
Tulpas go on dates with
other tulpas... dates.

24:35.732 --> 24:36.732
How does that work?

24:36.767 --> 24:37.977
You bring your tulpa,
they bring theirs.

24:38.001 --> 24:39.045
It's nuts. I can't believe that.

24:39.069 --> 24:40.769
You're taking it seriously.

24:40.804 --> 24:43.772
Well, what we're doing is,
we're taking grace seriously,

24:43.807 --> 24:45.218
Which is why it's important
for us to get a sense.

24:45.242 --> 24:47.008
Of who this alternate
personality is.

24:47.044 --> 24:49.010
And how she presents herself.

24:49.046 --> 24:51.112
Okay?

24:53.884 --> 24:56.751
Hi, grace. How you feeling?

24:59.056 --> 25:00.355
Okay.

25:00.390 --> 25:02.190
So we were wondering,

25:02.225 --> 25:04.025
Um, if it might be possible.

25:04.061 --> 25:06.962
For us to say hello to becca.

25:09.433 --> 25:11.499
You, too?

25:12.502 --> 25:14.736
Yeah.

25:14.771 --> 25:16.004
Okay.

25:16.039 --> 25:17.505
It'll just take a moment.

25:19.009 --> 25:21.776
Take all the time you need.

25:29.553 --> 25:31.987
What's up?

25:32.022 --> 25:33.755
Hello, becca.

25:33.790 --> 25:36.825
I'm dr. Charles,
and this is dr. Reese.

25:38.428 --> 25:40.195
I think you know mark.

25:41.565 --> 25:43.798
Hey.

25:46.536 --> 25:48.069
Mark, would you like to...

25:48.105 --> 25:49.170
To get us started off?

25:54.811 --> 25:57.178
Becca.

25:57.214 --> 25:59.781
I heard that you and grace
had a fight.

25:59.816 --> 26:01.449
So? I'd like to hear about it.

26:01.485 --> 26:03.818
I'm sure you would.

26:05.589 --> 26:09.090
Um, becca, the more
forthcoming you could be...

26:09.126 --> 26:12.193
Fine.

26:12.229 --> 26:16.197
I was explaining how
you don't love her.

26:16.233 --> 26:17.265
Of course I love her.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.234
Then why don't you want her
to have any friends?

26:19.269 --> 26:20.068
This is crazy.

26:20.103 --> 26:21.936
Grace, can I please
just talk to you?

26:21.972 --> 26:23.271
No. You deal with me.

26:23.306 --> 26:24.806
I want grace to have friends,

26:24.841 --> 26:27.208
But she spends all day
and night online.

26:27.244 --> 26:28.443
That's where her friends are.

26:28.478 --> 26:30.779
Chatrooms for tulpamancers!

26:30.814 --> 26:32.047
For what?

26:32.082 --> 26:33.214
Tulpamancers.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.293
That's... that's what
they call it.

26:34.317 --> 26:35.784
Grace wasn't always like this.

26:35.819 --> 26:36.785
She used to be normal.

26:36.820 --> 26:37.986
"Used to be"?

26:38.021 --> 26:40.588
Grace and I were
married for two years.

26:40.624 --> 26:42.057
Before you showed up.

26:42.092 --> 26:44.559
I didn't "show up."

26:44.594 --> 26:48.096
Grace just told you
about me last year.

26:48.131 --> 26:49.064
What does that mean?

26:49.099 --> 26:52.333
It means she created me
in high school.

26:53.937 --> 26:55.203
High school? Yeah.

26:55.238 --> 26:58.973
I'm the reason she was able to
move out of her parents' house.

26:59.009 --> 27:01.109
I'm the reason she got up
the courage to meet you.

27:01.144 --> 27:02.110
At that party...

27:02.145 --> 27:03.856
Grace, can I just...
I'm the one who's been.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.480
With her all these years,

27:05.515 --> 27:07.916
Not you... me.

27:07.951 --> 27:10.985
Whoever you are,
you tell my wife.

27:11.021 --> 27:13.321
That she has to choose.

27:13.356 --> 27:16.157
It's either becca or me.

27:31.241 --> 27:34.008
Obviously, she is
profoundly disturbed,

27:34.044 --> 27:36.177
Which we should've known
when she first said "tulpa."

27:36.213 --> 27:39.481
Why are we treating her like
she is sane when she isn't?

27:39.516 --> 27:41.127
Wouldn't that be
a little too easy, though?

27:41.151 --> 27:42.228
I mean, sure, we could,
you know,

27:42.252 --> 27:45.353
Slap a label on her, put her in
some diagnostic box,

27:45.388 --> 27:47.021
Pour some medicine on top...

27:47.057 --> 27:49.324
But sometimes it's a little
more complicated than that.

27:49.359 --> 27:51.860
She had an argument
with her made-up friend.

27:51.895 --> 27:53.895
While her subconscious
crashed the car.

27:53.930 --> 27:54.896
It seems pretty simple to me.

27:54.931 --> 27:57.198
Grace is definitely
a fractured personality.

27:57.234 --> 27:59.178
But it's all the more reason
that we have a responsibility.

27:59.202 --> 28:01.302
To dig deeper
and figure out why.

28:01.338 --> 28:02.670
Right. I'm sorry, dr. Charles,

28:02.706 --> 28:04.639
But I like boxes.

28:04.674 --> 28:06.508
None of this makes any sense.

28:06.543 --> 28:08.376
It is all so subjective.

28:08.411 --> 28:11.312
I hate it.
I mean, where's the science?

28:11.348 --> 28:15.416
Dr. Reese, every medical
discipline, psychiatry included,

28:15.452 --> 28:18.486
Is as much art as it is science.

28:18.522 --> 28:20.388
Well, I don't see
the science or the art.

28:20.423 --> 28:22.557
You know, everybody
was so surprised.

28:22.592 --> 28:25.693
When I went into this...
Me, the lab geek.

28:25.729 --> 28:28.296
Well, they were right.
I don't belong here.

28:40.535 --> 28:42.436
Excuse me for a second, guys.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.305
- Improvising.
- Sure.

28:49.178 --> 28:50.844
Looks like you're
having a good time.

28:53.049 --> 28:55.216
Very nice young woman.

28:55.251 --> 28:56.850
We're going up to my room.

28:56.886 --> 28:59.164
She has an irregular mole she'd
like me to take a look at.

28:59.188 --> 29:01.155
Was that her idea or yours?

29:01.190 --> 29:03.857
Here, doc, let me
freshen that up.

29:06.395 --> 29:09.830
Why don't the three of us
go over to the steakhouse?

29:09.865 --> 29:11.131
My treat.

29:11.167 --> 29:13.167
Dr. Rhodes, are you trying to...

29:13.202 --> 29:14.969
What is the expression...

29:15.004 --> 29:17.204
Interrupt my flow?

29:17.240 --> 29:19.306
No. No, I'm not.

29:30.286 --> 29:32.353
Night.

29:38.227 --> 29:40.327
Are they putting in
the tube now?

29:44.967 --> 29:46.200
Dad?

29:46.235 --> 29:48.269
I'm...

29:48.304 --> 29:49.870
Scared.

29:49.905 --> 29:51.238
I know, buddy.

29:51.274 --> 29:53.440
But the doctors are gonna
give you some medicine.

29:53.476 --> 29:55.209
So you sleep, and it won't hurt.

29:55.244 --> 29:56.410
Right?

29:56.445 --> 29:57.544
That's right.

29:57.580 --> 29:59.647
Dr. Manning? Yes?

30:01.417 --> 30:02.483
I'll be right back.

30:06.589 --> 30:08.922
Dcfs is on their way.

30:08.958 --> 30:12.426
Okay, um, just tell 'em
I need a minute.

30:12.461 --> 30:13.894
Fine.

30:13.929 --> 30:15.529
But they won't wait long.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.064
Okay.

30:17.099 --> 30:18.399
Just want you to know,

30:18.434 --> 30:22.036
You're the best son
a dad could hope for.

30:22.071 --> 30:24.705
You are so brave,

30:24.740 --> 30:26.440
And I am so proud of you.

30:29.245 --> 30:32.146
And I love you.

30:32.181 --> 30:35.082
So, so much.

30:42.758 --> 30:44.224
Ms. Holloway.

30:45.294 --> 30:47.127
Where you going? Home.

30:47.163 --> 30:50.064
Andrew jackson gets anxious when
you don't change his water.

30:50.099 --> 30:52.399
But we decided that you'd stay
and get a full workup.

30:52.435 --> 30:54.935
You decided that.
But, ms. Holloway...

30:54.970 --> 30:56.337
I'm not sure I even believe.

30:56.372 --> 30:59.406
All this toxic
whatever business.

30:59.442 --> 31:03.177
And even if I did, would it
be me believing you?

31:03.212 --> 31:06.180
Or the parasite?

31:06.215 --> 31:08.582
What was the point of even
telling me all that stuff?

31:12.321 --> 31:15.522
She's just gonna be back
with another coronary event.

31:15.558 --> 31:19.293
Funny thing about the truth...
It rarely sets anyone free.

31:26.302 --> 31:29.203
Think she likes you.

31:29.238 --> 31:30.637
I hope that's a compliment.

31:30.673 --> 31:33.607
Actually, it's more
of a diagnostic clue.

31:33.642 --> 31:38.479
Turns out men with toxo are more
attractive to infected women.

31:38.514 --> 31:42.449
And it also makes them
rumpled, introverted,

31:42.485 --> 31:44.785
Dismissive of rules,
and secretive.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.320
Are you insinuating something?

31:46.355 --> 31:47.721
Not insinuating,
directly stating.

31:47.757 --> 31:49.223
That you might have toxo, too.

31:49.258 --> 31:51.692
Yeah, thanks, nancy drew,
but it's not possible.

31:51.727 --> 31:53.327
You know I'm not a cat person.

31:53.362 --> 31:54.728
Actually, I had no idea.

31:54.764 --> 31:56.630
Maybe because you
are so secretive.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.332
I take it back, perry mason.

31:58.367 --> 31:59.666
You ever consider the law?

32:01.103 --> 32:02.302
You are avoiding.

32:02.338 --> 32:04.471
Why don't we just
do a blood test?

32:04.507 --> 32:06.173
Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah?

32:06.208 --> 32:07.319
Blood test, good idea, great.

32:07.343 --> 32:10.310
Great, I will
find you after work.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.312
See you then.

32:14.750 --> 32:16.350
Hey, somebody help!

32:20.289 --> 32:21.722
She's tachycardic
and tachypneic.

32:21.757 --> 32:23.257
Sats at 84.

32:23.292 --> 32:25.159
Grace, does this hurt?
Hey, what's happening?

32:25.194 --> 32:26.593
Is she bleeding?
I don't think so.

32:26.629 --> 32:29.263
Belly's benign.
Cts were negative.

32:29.298 --> 32:31.198
Rhythm's gone.
Ekg leads are coming off.

32:31.233 --> 32:32.244
She's sweating like crazy.

32:32.268 --> 32:33.100
Let's get the crash cart.

32:33.135 --> 32:35.269
Heart attack?
No cyanosis or pallor.

32:35.304 --> 32:36.370
Check her rhythm.

32:38.307 --> 32:40.374
Fast but regular.

32:42.378 --> 32:45.379
Wait.

32:45.414 --> 32:47.047
Grace, talk to becca.

32:47.082 --> 32:49.450
What? Talk to her, grace.

32:49.485 --> 32:52.352
Sarah. Can you talk to becca?

32:52.388 --> 32:54.855
Is she there?

32:54.890 --> 32:56.223
What's she telling you?

32:56.258 --> 32:57.458
To breathe.

32:57.493 --> 32:58.325
This could be
blunt cardiac trauma.

32:58.360 --> 32:59.793
Let's get an ekg,
labs, and an echo.

32:59.829 --> 33:01.395
No, no, no, wait. Breathe.

33:01.430 --> 33:02.863
Anything else?

33:02.898 --> 33:05.632
Um, imagine us in
a peaceful place.

33:05.668 --> 33:07.367
Okay, then listen to her.

33:07.403 --> 33:09.470
Reese, we need... listen to her.

33:21.784 --> 33:23.550
Sats back up to 96.

33:25.454 --> 33:27.488
She was having a panic attack.

33:27.523 --> 33:29.289
And becca talked her down.

33:45.274 --> 33:48.408
Hey, I got your call.

33:48.444 --> 33:49.843
Dr. Latham, are...

33:49.879 --> 33:51.645
Something wrong?

33:51.680 --> 33:54.448
That woman... she asked me
to get ice for our drinks,

33:54.483 --> 33:55.627
And when I returned,
she was gone,

33:55.651 --> 33:58.118
As was the $200 in my wallet
and my watch.

33:58.153 --> 34:00.153
That my parents gave me
for graduation!

34:00.189 --> 34:02.155
I... Really.

34:03.192 --> 34:04.469
Your skepticism
was well-founded.

34:04.493 --> 34:06.460
I should have...

34:06.495 --> 34:09.463
Never allowed myself
to get involved like that.

34:11.900 --> 34:14.167
My mother will be very upset.

34:28.884 --> 34:32.319
Gabe's mri results.

34:32.353 --> 34:33.520
His tumors are shrinking?

34:33.556 --> 34:34.821
Doesn't make sense, right?

34:34.857 --> 34:37.190
I mean, chemo can suppress
the immune system,

34:37.226 --> 34:38.436
And the immune system
helps fight cancer.

34:38.460 --> 34:41.194
So being off chemo might have
allowed his immune system.

34:41.230 --> 34:42.329
To recuperate.

34:42.364 --> 34:43.297
It would explain his fever...

34:43.331 --> 34:45.331
Signs that his body's
starting to fight again.

34:45.367 --> 34:46.511
And it's fighting the cancer.

34:46.534 --> 34:48.534
Yeah, I mean...

34:48.571 --> 34:52.371
Withholding chemo might actually
have saved his life.

34:54.376 --> 34:55.909
Ms. Goodwin, we don't
need to do this.

34:55.945 --> 34:58.912
I'm sorry, it's in the hands
of dcfs now.

34:58.948 --> 35:00.480
No, no. I was wrong.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.683
He doesn't need the medication.
What's going on?

35:02.718 --> 35:04.484
Mr. Moore, I'm placing you
under arrest...

35:04.520 --> 35:05.897
No, no, no, please!
For medical child neglect.

35:05.921 --> 35:08.589
Dr. Manning? No, just stop.

35:08.624 --> 35:10.591
Everything's okay.
Excuse me, ma'am.

35:10.626 --> 35:12.726
I'm not leaving my son.
No, you need to listen to me.

35:12.761 --> 35:14.895
Okay? Gabe's tumors
are shrinking.

35:14.930 --> 35:16.597
Because he didn't get the chemo.

35:16.632 --> 35:17.698
Gabe is gonna get better!

35:17.733 --> 35:19.199
He's gonna live?

35:19.234 --> 35:20.367
He's got a long ways to go,

35:20.402 --> 35:22.336
But yes.

35:23.906 --> 35:25.973
Sir, I need your hands.

35:31.547 --> 35:32.879
Adam, we'll fix this.

35:32.915 --> 35:35.582
Whatever happens,
it was worth it.

35:45.793 --> 35:47.027
Hey, man.

35:47.062 --> 35:48.195
Hey, there.Nope.

35:48.230 --> 35:52.065
So, here's the deal.

35:52.101 --> 35:55.068
I'm gonna need everything
that she took from my friend,

35:55.104 --> 35:58.071
And I'm gonna give you one hour.

35:58.107 --> 36:00.941
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:00.976 --> 36:03.977
Dr. Latham came all
the way out here.

36:04.013 --> 36:05.946
To save the life
of the mayor's daughter,

36:05.981 --> 36:10.050
So how do you think
the mayor's gonna react.

36:10.085 --> 36:14.921
When he hears that you
ripped that doctor off?

36:14.957 --> 36:17.591
The watch and the $300.

36:17.626 --> 36:19.760
It... it was only $200.

36:19.795 --> 36:22.663
Call it punitive damages
for pain and suffering.

36:22.698 --> 36:23.997
Come on, man.

36:24.033 --> 36:26.767
One... Hour.

36:33.142 --> 36:35.575
Much better.

36:35.611 --> 36:37.778
Thank you.

36:37.813 --> 36:39.112
His temp's coming down.

36:39.148 --> 36:40.947
Antibiotics are finally working.

36:40.983 --> 36:42.583
Goodwin said his aunt
will stay with him.

36:42.618 --> 36:45.085
Until she can get
the charges dropped.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.688
Sorry I got so
worked up earlier.

36:47.723 --> 36:49.623
I... you had a point.

36:49.658 --> 36:52.125
I get these thoughts
and urges now.

36:52.161 --> 36:54.928
Maybe it's this little tyrant
in my uterus.

36:54.963 --> 36:57.030
You think?

36:57.066 --> 36:59.533
I'll be really glad when
this part is over.

36:59.568 --> 37:01.201
The part where every
decision you make.

37:01.236 --> 37:03.036
Is because of your child?

37:03.072 --> 37:05.505
I hate to break it to you,
but that one's forever.

37:12.081 --> 37:13.480
Hey, ready to go?

37:13.515 --> 37:16.183
Yeah.

37:16.218 --> 37:18.285
Hey, by the way, um,

37:18.320 --> 37:20.654
When I asked you about
natalie before,

37:20.689 --> 37:24.024
I... i really appreciate
your being honest with me.

37:24.059 --> 37:25.992
Yeah.

37:26.028 --> 37:29.162
Look, nina, about that...

37:29.198 --> 37:31.531
Yeah?

37:31.567 --> 37:33.033
Well, just...

37:33.068 --> 37:34.301
Of course.

37:34.336 --> 37:37.204
Relationships are built
on trust, right?

37:37.239 --> 37:39.573
Yes.

37:39.608 --> 37:42.876
Which is why I feel like I
need to tell you something.

37:42.911 --> 37:44.244
You know dr. Rauch
in cardiology?

37:44.279 --> 37:47.180
I... Dated him.

37:47.216 --> 37:49.216
Yeah?

37:49.251 --> 37:51.885
Okay. I like rauch.

37:53.789 --> 37:56.857
I also dated jay flint in gi.

37:56.892 --> 37:58.191
Flint? Heavyset guy?

37:58.227 --> 38:01.027
It was just a summer thing.

38:01.063 --> 38:05.699
Dr. Sherman was a little
more serious, but I don't know.

38:12.207 --> 38:15.208
Your friend wanted to make
sure that you got these back.

38:15.244 --> 38:17.210
She had an emergency phone call.
She had to leave.

38:17.246 --> 38:18.178
It turns out that
the whole thing.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.547
Was just a big, old mistake.

38:20.582 --> 38:23.183
This is too much.
I only had $200.

38:23.218 --> 38:25.685
Yeah, she just felt terrible
about the whole thing.

38:25.721 --> 38:27.287
She wanted to buy you dinner.

38:30.259 --> 38:31.992
Is that really what happened?

38:34.630 --> 38:37.264
Dr. Latham, I'm sorry that
I brought you out here.

38:37.299 --> 38:40.100
My ambition to do the surgery
got the best of me.

38:40.135 --> 38:42.035
It was selfish.

38:43.305 --> 38:45.272
Well, don't apologize.

38:45.307 --> 38:48.175
All in all, I had
a really good time.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.654
How's she doing? Which one?

39:00.689 --> 39:03.056
Grace, becca? Who knows?

39:03.091 --> 39:05.392
Mr. Scott, if there's
a part of grace.

39:05.427 --> 39:08.762
That she didn't feel comfortable
sharing with you before,

39:08.797 --> 39:11.598
Is it not at all possible to see
anything that's happened here.

39:11.633 --> 39:12.799
As a sign of progress?

39:12.835 --> 39:15.602
Progress?

39:15.637 --> 39:18.605
Yeah, I just learned how
unbalanced my wife really is.

39:18.640 --> 39:20.140
And that she doesn't need me.

39:20.175 --> 39:22.943
She needs... Becca.

39:22.978 --> 39:24.077
I'm done.

39:26.715 --> 39:28.348
This was a total disaster.

39:28.383 --> 39:30.283
I'm not so sure that's true.

39:30.319 --> 39:31.329
I mean, from grace's
perspective,

39:31.353 --> 39:35.121
This could be as close
to a win as we can get.

39:35.157 --> 39:37.324
She just chose her tulpa
over her husband...

39:37.359 --> 39:38.992
Her tulpa that
almost killed her.

39:39.027 --> 39:41.962
I just saw her tulpa
talk her off a ledge.

39:41.997 --> 39:45.832
I have no idea what to think.

39:45.868 --> 39:49.970
Like it or not, the line
between a psychological illness.

39:50.005 --> 39:52.305
And a coping mechanism
is a blurry one.

39:52.341 --> 39:54.319
I mean, just 'cause we don't
give them names and voices.

39:54.343 --> 39:57.143
Doesn't mean we don't all
have different sides.

39:57.179 --> 39:59.212
I mean, our personalities
change based on.

39:59.248 --> 40:01.281
How much sleep we get,

40:01.316 --> 40:02.516
How hungry we are.

40:02.551 --> 40:06.386
Hell, intestinal bacteria could
be the determining factor.

40:06.421 --> 40:08.688
In our emotions.

40:12.060 --> 40:14.327
Look...

40:14.363 --> 40:17.330
I know you think of yourself.

40:17.366 --> 40:20.734
As an analytical thinker
and a scientist.

40:20.769 --> 40:23.703
And that you're wondering
if you have a place.

40:23.739 --> 40:26.339
In psychiatry right now.

40:26.375 --> 40:28.408
But I also see this
other sarah in there,

40:28.443 --> 40:32.879
And she's filled with intuition
and compassion, humanity...

40:32.915 --> 40:35.181
And when you put 'em
both together,

40:35.217 --> 40:38.351
Like during grace's
panic attack today...

40:40.355 --> 40:42.389
Then I see a sensational
psychiatrist.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.166
Toxo screen. You a fainter?

40:53.201 --> 40:54.868
Or can we do this sitting up?

40:54.903 --> 40:57.504
You mind if we hold off
on that right now?

40:57.539 --> 40:59.506
Come on. I got a better idea.

41:04.279 --> 41:07.180
Believe it or not, studies show
that cat videos.

41:07.215 --> 41:08.515
Are actually good for people.

41:09.952 --> 41:13.253
They increase energy
and positive emotions.

41:13.288 --> 41:15.455
It's crazy, right? Yeah.

41:15.490 --> 41:18.091
But you know, in the interest
of full disclosure.

41:18.126 --> 41:22.896
And to repudiate this bizarre
accusation of secretiveness,

41:22.931 --> 41:24.297
I never had a problem with cats.

41:24.333 --> 41:25.432
Really? Really.

41:25.467 --> 41:28.268
Matter of fact,

41:28.303 --> 41:29.936
I actually had a cat once.

41:29.972 --> 41:31.871
Yeah.

41:31.907 --> 41:33.406
Name of pete.

41:33.442 --> 41:36.977
Abyssinian/siamese mix.

41:37.012 --> 41:40.246
Used to jump on my chest
in the morning to wake me up.

41:40.282 --> 41:43.083
Had these claws that could
tear a tin can.

41:45.087 --> 41:46.564
But he never hurt
a living soul, that pete,

41:46.588 --> 41:50.390
Which was especially good news
for all those mice
