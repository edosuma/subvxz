Previously
on "the secret circle"...

00:02.307 --> 00:04.490
16 years ago,
what Blackwell really wanted

00:04.492 --> 00:06.859
from the circle
was children.

00:06.861 --> 00:09.195
Enough Balcoin blood

00:09.197 --> 00:11.898
to ensure that the next
circle would be dark

00:11.900 --> 00:13.533
at its very core.

00:13.535 --> 00:14.917
We found out
that my father

00:14.919 --> 00:16.569
made sure that our parents
got pregnant

00:16.571 --> 00:18.988
so that he could come back
and use our circle.

00:18.990 --> 00:21.491
Blackwell's using
them to build a crystal skull.

00:21.493 --> 00:23.776
He says he needs it
to fight the witch hunters.

00:23.778 --> 00:25.194
We can't give
the most evil man we know

00:25.196 --> 00:27.046
the world's most
powerful weapon.

00:27.048 --> 00:28.080
Eben got away.

00:28.082 --> 00:29.549
- Where's Faye?
- He took her.

00:29.551 --> 00:31.234
But we have
the sixth crystal.

00:31.236 --> 00:32.752
We can build
the skull.

00:32.753 --> 00:34.053
We can save her.

00:50.021 --> 00:51.888
Wait.

00:51.890 --> 00:54.891
Please just tell me I've been
asleep for two straight days

00:54.893 --> 00:56.308
and we're halfway
across the country.

00:56.310 --> 00:57.577
Not quite.

00:57.579 --> 01:01.330
You fell asleep two hours ago,
halfway to the brew.

01:02.749 --> 01:05.334
I didn't think you
wanted to go back home,

01:05.336 --> 01:06.636
so I parked.

01:06.638 --> 01:09.055
I like my version better.

01:09.057 --> 01:10.273
Hmm.

01:13.928 --> 01:15.344
I'm sorry.

01:15.346 --> 01:17.096
It's been doing that
all night.

01:17.098 --> 01:18.464
I glanced over
a couple times,

01:18.466 --> 01:20.983
just to make sure
that it was no...

01:20.985 --> 01:22.919
wake-up warranted
emergencies.

01:22.921 --> 01:26.489
But it was just some
stuff about Faye

01:26.491 --> 01:28.891
and a guy named Eben.

01:37.018 --> 01:42.021
I have to go.
Like usual.

01:42.023 --> 01:43.839
Because an uninterrupted
moment with you

01:43.841 --> 01:45.374
is just too much
to ask for

01:51.164 --> 01:53.666
do you really want me to
take you across the country?

01:54.985 --> 01:57.186
I will, you know.

01:57.188 --> 02:00.106
I know.

02:00.108 --> 02:04.493
And I do. Someday.

02:11.818 --> 02:13.552
Aah!

02:13.554 --> 02:15.054
Aah!

02:17.241 --> 02:18.574
Relax!

02:18.576 --> 02:21.193
I don't think you realize
I'm a very powerful witch.

02:21.195 --> 02:22.828
Without your friends,

02:22.830 --> 02:25.665
you're nothing but
a little girl in a cheap dress.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.283
This dress is not cheap.

02:27.285 --> 02:29.752
Ahh!

02:39.012 --> 02:41.347
Can I borrow
your phone?

02:44.851 --> 02:47.103
Give me your hands!

02:48.421 --> 02:50.439
Let's see what
your life's worth.

03:03.581 --> 03:05.415
We have to find her.

03:05.417 --> 03:07.200
There has to be
some spell, right?

03:07.202 --> 03:09.002
Not that we know of,
or have ever done.

03:09.004 --> 03:10.787
Why can't we just
ask your father?

03:10.789 --> 03:13.707
No. No way.

03:13.709 --> 03:14.758
You didn't
tell them?

03:14.760 --> 03:17.377
Yes. I told them
every horrible detail.

03:17.379 --> 03:18.361
We know what he did.

03:18.363 --> 03:20.964
We know Blackwell
manipulated our parents

03:20.966 --> 03:22.966
into creating our circle.

03:22.968 --> 03:24.551
But we still need help.

03:24.553 --> 03:28.738
He's a lying,
power hungry lunatic.

03:28.740 --> 03:32.459
We came together because
our power as a circle

03:32.461 --> 03:34.311
is stronger than
it was individually.

03:34.313 --> 03:36.146
Let's use that
to get Faye.

03:36.148 --> 03:38.097
The six of us together
couldn't stop Samuel,

03:38.099 --> 03:41.318
and he only had one
demon in him. Eben has six.

03:46.742 --> 03:48.041
It's her.

03:48.043 --> 03:49.459
Faye?

03:49.461 --> 03:52.278
No. But I have her
right here.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.348
Don't you dare touch her.

03:55.350 --> 03:57.300
Bring a crystal
to the ferry boat

03:57.302 --> 03:59.786
where I killed
your parents.

03:59.788 --> 04:01.488
Or she'll burn
like they did.

04:01.490 --> 04:04.462
Why? The demons running
around your brain isn't

04:04.487 --> 04:05.593
doing it for you?

04:05.594 --> 04:07.928
You need some extra
crystal magic?

04:07.930 --> 04:10.096
No, I like the
demons very much.

04:10.098 --> 04:12.799
Which is why I need
one of your crystals

04:12.801 --> 04:15.235
so you can't form
the crystal skull.

04:18.824 --> 04:21.024
He'll trade Faye
for one crystal.

04:22.293 --> 04:23.476
Ok, we do it.

04:23.478 --> 04:24.611
And trust Eben?

04:24.613 --> 04:26.763
He'll never give Faye up.

04:26.765 --> 04:29.315
The only chance Faye has
is if we kill Eben

04:29.317 --> 04:30.784
before he hurts her.

04:30.786 --> 04:33.086
And the only way to do that
is with the crystal skull.

04:33.088 --> 04:34.204
Are you sure?

04:34.206 --> 04:36.039
The only reason
we think that

04:36.041 --> 04:37.824
is because Blackwell
told us,

04:37.826 --> 04:39.576
and we know we can't
trust him.

04:39.578 --> 04:41.969
My grandfather said that
it's the most dangerous

04:41.994 --> 04:43.804
weapon ever created.

04:44.132 --> 04:46.489
Eben only wants a crystal
so that we can't form

04:46.514 --> 04:47.953
the crystal skull.

04:48.770 --> 04:50.153
It must be the way
to kill him.

04:50.155 --> 04:52.138
And Blackwell
is the only one

04:52.140 --> 04:53.890
who knows
how to work it.

04:57.011 --> 04:59.613
And we'd have to be there
to put it together.

04:59.615 --> 05:00.680
What?

05:00.682 --> 05:01.681
Balcoin blood.

05:01.683 --> 05:02.816
According to Blackwell,

05:02.818 --> 05:05.769
we're not only connected
to the crystals,

05:05.771 --> 05:08.321
we're also connected
to the skull.

05:08.323 --> 05:10.891
Look, whether
we trust him or not,

05:10.893 --> 05:12.425
it's better for you
to be there.

05:12.427 --> 05:14.411
That way you can make
sure Blackwell

05:14.413 --> 05:16.413
and the skull
get to that boat.

05:19.867 --> 05:21.034
We'll meet you there.

05:21.036 --> 05:22.502
We need a backup plan

05:22.504 --> 05:23.637
if the skull doesn't
come through.

05:23.639 --> 05:26.423
If we stay away from Eben,

05:26.425 --> 05:28.592
our circle magic can stop
the witch hunters.

05:31.395 --> 05:32.896
Ok. I guess that is
our best chance.

05:32.898 --> 05:34.197
After Faye's safe,

05:34.199 --> 05:36.933
then we can figure out
how to deal with Blackwell,

05:36.935 --> 05:39.385
using the strength
of our circle.

05:39.387 --> 05:42.622
I hope it's not
too late.

05:44.008 --> 05:46.026
Thank God you called.

05:46.028 --> 05:49.729
Dawn, I think Amelia
was here.

05:49.731 --> 05:51.114
What?

05:51.999 --> 05:54.501
Everything that I did
when I killed her,

05:54.503 --> 05:55.869
it happened to me.

05:55.871 --> 05:58.288
First, the water.

05:58.290 --> 05:59.506
Then flames.

05:59.508 --> 06:01.074
I know it sounds insane--

06:01.076 --> 06:02.292
Not really.

06:02.294 --> 06:05.178
Blackwell told me he
wanted to destroy you.

06:05.180 --> 06:08.682
That Diana's loyalty to you
was getting in his way.

06:08.684 --> 06:12.469
So he wanted me to think that I
was being haunted by Amelia's ghost.

06:12.471 --> 06:13.737
And I did just
what he wanted.

06:13.739 --> 06:16.306
I admitted to Diana
that I killed Amelia.

06:16.308 --> 06:18.558
She ran out, and I haven't
been able to reach her since.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.160
I can't find Faye,
either.

06:21.162 --> 06:23.196
Something terrible
is happening, Charles.

06:23.198 --> 06:25.782
And our blind quest for power
helped set it all in motion.

06:25.784 --> 06:28.267
We're the ones that brought
Cassie Blake back home.

06:28.269 --> 06:30.787
We have to get
our powers back

06:30.789 --> 06:32.105
and help the circle.

06:32.107 --> 06:36.042
And there's one person that can
make that happen.

06:45.252 --> 06:47.253
There he is.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.973
That's where
my mother died.

07:06.975 --> 07:09.776
All of our mothers.

07:11.311 --> 07:16.082
I thought I'd feel closure
or something, but I don't.

07:16.084 --> 07:18.251
I just feel angry.

07:18.253 --> 07:20.286
I know.

07:27.478 --> 07:30.663
Wow, this place
is beautiful.

07:30.665 --> 07:32.098
Ceremonies here
date back

07:32.100 --> 07:34.634
to our ancestors' first arrival
in Chance Harbor.

07:34.636 --> 07:37.053
What do we have to do?

07:38.522 --> 07:40.390
In order to create
the skull,

07:40.392 --> 07:43.610
we first have to
destroy each family crystal

07:43.612 --> 07:47.313
and let their energies
reform...

07:47.315 --> 07:51.968
back into their original
collective shape.

07:51.970 --> 07:53.420
But in doing so,

07:53.422 --> 07:59.042
your powers are no longer
connected to a crystal.

07:59.044 --> 08:02.629
Or to each other.

08:02.631 --> 08:05.832
Which means your circle
will be unbound.

08:11.803 --> 08:14.722
No. No way.
We can't unbind the circle.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.201
Not without talking
to the others.

08:16.203 --> 08:17.369
This is the only way
to create the skull.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.787
- Diana.
- What?

08:18.789 --> 08:21.339
The circle makes us
stronger, remember?

08:21.341 --> 08:22.573
What if this is
the only way?

08:22.575 --> 08:23.592
It can't be.

08:23.594 --> 08:24.876
I'm afraid it is.

08:24.878 --> 08:26.761
Now look, I know
it's hard to accept.

08:26.763 --> 08:29.097
They are waiting for us
at the ferry.

08:29.099 --> 08:30.515
Our friends.

08:30.517 --> 08:32.183
Where
the witch hunters are.

08:32.184 --> 08:34.635
What happens to them
if we unbind?

08:34.638 --> 08:36.638
I'm not sure.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.490
But what I do know
is what happens

08:38.491 --> 08:41.109
if we don't put together
the skull.

08:41.111 --> 08:44.429
Faye dies.

08:44.431 --> 08:46.247
We don't have a choice.

08:47.483 --> 08:50.268
Let's get started.

09:13.259 --> 09:15.593
Each one of you
come forward,

09:15.595 --> 09:17.962
take two crystals.

09:18.814 --> 09:20.065
Come on.

09:23.302 --> 09:24.853
Come on.

10:07.113 --> 10:09.347
Now what?

10:11.317 --> 10:14.903
We wait for the skull
to come to us.

10:19.858 --> 10:20.825
Let's go.

10:20.827 --> 10:22.860
Go where?

10:22.862 --> 10:24.629
We're waiting for
Cassie and Diana.

10:24.631 --> 10:26.197
We'll come back.

10:26.199 --> 10:27.832
I have to see
if Faye's ok.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.534
Jake!

10:29.536 --> 10:30.719
Don't be an idiot.

10:30.721 --> 10:32.003
We're only going
up against the witch hunters

10:32.005 --> 10:33.371
if the skull plan
falls through.

10:33.373 --> 10:35.090
It's too dangerous.

10:39.195 --> 10:40.762
Did you guys
feel that?

10:40.764 --> 10:42.147
Yeah, like my heart
skipped a beat.

10:42.149 --> 10:43.548
I felt it, too.

10:45.017 --> 10:48.019
Look, I'm getting
on that boat, ok?

10:48.021 --> 10:49.154
They won't see me.

10:49.156 --> 10:50.655
I have to know
she's alive.

10:51.557 --> 10:53.575
Jake, stop!

10:53.577 --> 10:55.226
Ahh! Aah!

10:59.533 --> 11:01.032
What the hell?

11:01.034 --> 11:03.201
You two are ganging
up on me now?

11:03.203 --> 11:05.036
What happened to
the circle's our strength?

11:05.038 --> 11:06.337
I didn't do it,
I swear.

11:06.339 --> 11:08.739
No, no. It was me.
I felt it.

11:08.741 --> 11:11.760
I have my solo magic back.

11:13.629 --> 11:17.915
That means the circle's not
bound anymore.

11:19.585 --> 11:22.148
I am calling
Cassie and Diana.

11:22.173 --> 11:23.460
None of us are getting
on that boat

11:23.461 --> 11:26.646
until we figure out
what is going on.

11:38.303 --> 11:41.105
Ahh!

11:44.443 --> 11:46.227
Please let this
be happening.

11:57.122 --> 11:59.624
Oh, I am so back.

12:15.090 --> 12:17.008
My phone.

12:29.488 --> 12:31.906
Who's
the little girl now?

12:35.744 --> 12:37.078
Hello, mother.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.447
Where's Diana?

12:39.449 --> 12:40.781
We don't know.

12:40.783 --> 12:42.199
Something's happened
to the circle,

12:42.201 --> 12:44.902
and we need our powers back
to track them down.

12:46.072 --> 12:48.923
Faye. Are you all right?

12:48.925 --> 12:52.293
Mom, I'm so, so sorry,

12:52.295 --> 12:54.679
but I've kind of got myself into
a lot of trouble

12:54.681 --> 12:56.097
and I need your help.

12:56.099 --> 12:58.933
The thing is,
I know I'm a witch.

12:58.935 --> 13:01.435
I know. Just tell me
where you are.

13:01.437 --> 13:04.088
How did you know? Have
you been reading my journal?

13:04.090 --> 13:05.723
Faye, it doesn't matter.
Just tell me where you are.

13:05.725 --> 13:07.591
Eben has us on
the ferry boat.

13:07.593 --> 13:10.361
I can't get out because they're
guarding all the exits.

13:10.363 --> 13:12.897
Eben?
Oh, my God.

13:12.899 --> 13:15.399
Look, I'm coming
to get you, all right?

13:15.401 --> 13:16.901
He has demons in him,
mom.

13:16.903 --> 13:20.037
So if you've got any kick-ass
magic you've been hiding,

13:20.039 --> 13:23.040
now would be the time
to whip it out.

13:23.042 --> 13:24.542
Ahh!

13:24.544 --> 13:26.443
Faye? Faye!

13:26.445 --> 13:28.913
Get off me.

13:34.953 --> 13:36.304
She's on the ferry.

13:36.306 --> 13:39.140
- Is Diana with her?
- I don't know.

13:39.142 --> 13:41.676
Look, I know you wish
you could've done more

13:41.678 --> 13:43.761
to stop what happened
16 years ago.

13:43.763 --> 13:48.933
Please, let's not let it
happen again.

13:51.036 --> 13:55.489
Your power was destroyed
when we stripped it.

13:55.491 --> 13:57.408
It can't be
restored.

14:02.864 --> 14:05.032
So I'm going to
give you mine.

14:15.827 --> 14:17.428
It's coming.

14:20.799 --> 14:22.833
Cassie,
what are you doing?

14:23.769 --> 14:25.102
I can feel it.

14:50.879 --> 14:52.079
Hurry!

14:52.081 --> 14:53.297
Pick it up while
it's still forming.

14:53.299 --> 14:54.498
Pick it up.

15:15.103 --> 15:17.822
Its power
is amazing.

15:22.577 --> 15:25.162
Diana.

15:25.164 --> 15:27.331
It's ok.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.583
In fact,
it's awesome.

15:39.878 --> 15:43.247
Whatever happens,
do not remove your hands.

15:57.395 --> 15:58.646
It's done.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.134
Cassie, we are
really worried.

16:23.136 --> 16:24.585
Call me.

16:25.420 --> 16:27.388
Something is
definitely wrong.

16:27.390 --> 16:29.724
What if Blackwell
did something to them?

16:29.726 --> 16:30.975
Eben is expecting
a crystal.

16:30.977 --> 16:32.059
How long do you think
he's gonna--

16:32.061 --> 16:33.427
Ok, is there anything other
than death

16:33.429 --> 16:34.962
that could unbind
the circle?

16:34.964 --> 16:36.847
I don't know.
I hope so.

16:36.849 --> 16:38.132
But I'm getting Faye
out of there.

16:38.134 --> 16:39.400
How, Jake?

16:39.402 --> 16:41.135
Our power isn't as strong
if we're unbound.

16:41.137 --> 16:43.738
I don't know. But right now
she's more alone than we are.

16:43.740 --> 16:45.656
I'm not letting her
die in there.

16:45.658 --> 16:46.691
I'm coming with you.

16:46.693 --> 16:49.944
I have to go back
for Cassie and Diana.

16:49.946 --> 16:52.280
Wait.

16:52.282 --> 16:54.582
Be careful.

16:59.171 --> 17:00.755
Call me when
you know anything.

17:00.757 --> 17:02.423
I will.

17:02.425 --> 17:04.559
Hey, Adam.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.627
Try not to get killed.

17:07.630 --> 17:10.464
You, too.

17:26.315 --> 17:28.699
It's ready.

17:28.701 --> 17:30.701
Why can't I hold it?

17:30.703 --> 17:33.520
No. They are waiting
for us.

17:33.522 --> 17:35.072
Every second counts.

17:35.074 --> 17:36.490
This is gonna stop Eben,

17:36.492 --> 17:38.826
kill the demons
inside him?

17:38.828 --> 17:40.328
Yeah.

17:41.496 --> 17:43.881
Just hard to imagine.

17:43.883 --> 17:45.166
It's so beautiful.

17:45.168 --> 17:47.201
The skull reflects
your own power

17:47.203 --> 17:49.503
without limitations.

17:49.505 --> 17:54.375
It's like you said,
I felt my connection to it.

17:57.012 --> 17:58.479
But Diana's right.

17:58.481 --> 18:00.831
We're in a hurry.
Just give it back to me.

18:00.833 --> 18:03.884
Why can't I be the one
to use the skull against Eben?

18:03.886 --> 18:06.720
'Cause your dark magic isn't
advanced enough.

18:06.722 --> 18:08.356
And you don't know
what you're dealing with.

18:08.358 --> 18:09.657
Now give it to me.

18:12.995 --> 18:15.446
Yeah, why can't
Cassie do it?

18:15.448 --> 18:17.615
She's just as connected
to it as you are.

18:17.617 --> 18:20.117
If she needs help,
you can guide her.

18:21.536 --> 18:22.903
Nice touch.

18:22.905 --> 18:25.289
Playing up your connection
to the skull.

18:25.291 --> 18:26.791
What do you mean?

18:26.793 --> 18:28.926
I just want to be the one
to kill Eben.

18:28.928 --> 18:31.512
We all have
the same goal, right?

18:31.514 --> 18:36.050
No, Cassie, we don't
have the same goal.

18:36.052 --> 18:38.135
But we will.

18:52.484 --> 18:55.286
Can you give us
a minute?

18:55.288 --> 18:57.038
Of course.

18:58.023 --> 19:00.541
Thank you.

19:06.148 --> 19:08.716
I need to tell you
something.

19:08.718 --> 19:11.869
I've learned that Diana's
not my daughter.

19:11.871 --> 19:14.221
Of course she is.

19:14.223 --> 19:16.173
Blood doesn't
define a family.

19:16.175 --> 19:18.843
You've love that
beautiful girl since birth,

19:18.845 --> 19:20.411
and so have I.

19:20.413 --> 19:21.896
You knew?

19:21.898 --> 19:25.082
I suspected.

19:25.084 --> 19:27.718
But it made
no difference.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.970
She's ours.

19:29.972 --> 19:33.324
I can't let anything
happen to her.

19:35.360 --> 19:38.195
Charles, the demons
Eben harbors

19:38.197 --> 19:39.697
can't simply
be killed,

19:39.699 --> 19:41.665
not without
the crystal skull.

19:41.667 --> 19:45.819
I know there's
another way.

19:45.821 --> 19:48.172
This is my chance
for redemption

19:48.174 --> 19:51.709
and to do something
worthy of my daughter.

19:51.711 --> 19:54.295
But I need your help.

20:31.699 --> 20:32.866
Faye!

20:32.868 --> 20:35.586
Jake, what are you
doing here?

20:39.307 --> 20:41.725
Nice to see you, too.

20:41.727 --> 20:43.260
If anything had
happened to you,

20:43.262 --> 20:44.345
I don't know
what I would have--

20:44.347 --> 20:46.730
I'm ok.
Thank you for coming.

20:46.732 --> 20:48.015
Guys, there will be
plenty of time to cry

20:48.017 --> 20:49.716
if we can get out
of here.

20:49.718 --> 20:51.152
Ahh!

20:51.154 --> 20:52.770
Jake!

20:54.022 --> 20:55.356
Aah!

20:58.693 --> 20:59.827
I can't move.

21:04.416 --> 21:07.001
Time to die.

21:25.791 --> 21:27.625
Diana.

21:27.627 --> 21:29.293
Diana.

21:29.295 --> 21:31.429
Shh. Shh. Shh.

21:48.146 --> 21:50.898
I'm sorry,

21:50.900 --> 21:52.733
but I need you both here.

21:52.735 --> 21:56.637
But we need the skull
to stop Eben...

21:56.639 --> 21:58.539
Who's on the ferry.

22:00.692 --> 22:04.829
Yeah. Maybe some of the others
will find a way to stop him,

22:04.831 --> 22:08.299
but it doesn't
really matter.

22:09.968 --> 22:12.086
Why doesn't it
matter?

22:12.088 --> 22:14.588
I know this is hard
to understand,

22:14.590 --> 22:16.640
but everything
that I have done,

22:16.642 --> 22:19.727
everything that I'm doing,
is for you.

22:19.729 --> 22:22.446
Soon you'll be free.

22:22.448 --> 22:27.818
Free to finally be the witches
you were always meant to be.

22:33.275 --> 22:36.077
The ash
is blocking our power.

22:36.079 --> 22:38.029
I'm getting really tired
of these robes

22:38.031 --> 22:39.997
and this
stupid pole.

22:39.999 --> 22:42.399
Your friends abandoned you.

22:42.401 --> 22:43.784
I may not have the crystal,

22:43.786 --> 22:45.613
but at least I'll
have the pleasure

22:45.638 --> 22:47.238
of watching you burn.

22:47.239 --> 22:48.289
You don't
have to do this.

22:48.291 --> 22:49.724
But I do.

22:49.726 --> 22:52.493
Because of what you are.

22:52.495 --> 22:54.078
Abominations.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.847
You do realize
you're full of demons,

22:56.849 --> 22:58.849
amongst other things.

23:11.646 --> 23:12.947
Condemning us?

23:12.949 --> 23:14.565
You're the one
that should burn.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.567
You should
be grateful, Jake.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.702
Now you can finally
join your parents.

23:18.704 --> 23:20.071
Uhh!

23:25.912 --> 23:26.911
Aah!

23:31.183 --> 23:33.501
Smoke.

23:55.775 --> 23:57.241
Eben.

24:01.747 --> 24:02.980
Oh, God.
It's not just Faye.

24:02.982 --> 24:04.498
He's got three of them.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.750
Go around
the other way.

24:08.937 --> 24:10.621
I'll deal with him.

24:11.590 --> 24:13.657
Charles,
are you sure?

24:13.659 --> 24:15.292
Go.

24:18.797 --> 24:24.501
Exire daemonem voco.

24:24.503 --> 24:29.473
Exire daemonem voco.

24:29.475 --> 24:34.361
Exire daemonem voco.

24:34.363 --> 24:39.400
What are you doing?
Exire daemonem voco.

24:40.785 --> 24:41.819
What are you doing?

24:41.821 --> 24:44.288
Exire daemonem voco.
Exire daemonem voco.

24:44.290 --> 24:47.958
Exire daemonem voco.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.744
Exe daemonem voco.

24:50.746 --> 24:53.247
Aah!

25:00.472 --> 25:02.089
Mom!

25:02.091 --> 25:03.974
Mom!

25:14.219 --> 25:17.671
Exire daemonem voco.

25:18.908 --> 25:21.609
Exire daemonem voco.

25:23.778 --> 25:27.047
Exire daemonem voco.

25:27.049 --> 25:29.283
Exire daemonem voco.

25:29.285 --> 25:32.536
Exire daemonem voco.

25:38.744 --> 25:40.911
Where's Eben?
Come on.

25:40.913 --> 25:42.379
Take them.
I'll meet you outside.

25:42.381 --> 25:43.914
What are you doing?
Jake!

25:43.916 --> 25:45.933
Jake!

25:50.755 --> 25:53.423
This isn't over.

25:53.425 --> 25:54.975
It is for you.

25:54.977 --> 25:56.393
Uhh!

26:01.199 --> 26:03.867
This is for
my parents...

26:03.869 --> 26:06.603
and Nick.

26:27.409 --> 26:30.661
Did you ever plan
on killing Eben?

26:30.663 --> 26:32.396
You didn't, did you?

26:32.398 --> 26:35.299
You just needed Eben
to scare us

26:35.301 --> 26:36.650
into finding
the crystals.

26:36.652 --> 26:38.802
Witch hunters have
always been the best way

26:38.804 --> 26:40.437
to galvanize witches.

26:40.439 --> 26:43.691
You did it before,
16 years ago.

26:43.693 --> 26:46.610
You led our parents
to the same ferry boat

26:46.612 --> 26:48.195
to fight
the witch hunters.

26:48.197 --> 26:50.030
You left them
to die.

26:50.032 --> 26:52.482
Why manipulate them
into having children,

26:52.484 --> 26:54.418
then send them off
to be killed?

26:56.154 --> 26:57.738
So we'd
become orphans?

26:57.740 --> 27:02.503
A circle of broken, vulnerable,
easy to manipulate witches,

27:03.145 --> 27:06.880
desperate to find a leader
to help battle our enemies.

27:06.882 --> 27:09.350
But my mother
figured it out.

27:09.352 --> 27:11.668
She tried to get
the others not to go.

27:11.670 --> 27:13.437
She and Ethan tried
to kill you.

27:13.439 --> 27:15.005
Yeah.

27:15.007 --> 27:16.390
That was disappointing.

27:16.392 --> 27:19.727
But it gave me
a good opportunity

27:19.729 --> 27:22.646
to disappear and wait

27:22.648 --> 27:23.831
for you to be ready.

27:23.833 --> 27:26.867
Which you are.

27:31.956 --> 27:33.324
Charles!

27:38.296 --> 27:40.481
Charles,
what have you done?

27:40.483 --> 27:44.418
Tell Diana
that I love her.

27:50.425 --> 27:54.812
Ego vocare te
tenebris magicae.

27:54.814 --> 27:58.065
Exsurge hunc crystallo.

27:59.768 --> 28:04.238
Ego vocare te
tenebris magicae.

28:05.607 --> 28:07.624
Exsurge hunc crystallo.

28:09.761 --> 28:13.997
Ego vocare te
tenebris magicae.

28:13.999 --> 28:17.567
Exsurge hunc crystallo.

28:17.569 --> 28:21.238
If you're not using
the skull to kill witch hunters,

28:21.240 --> 28:23.006
what is it for?

28:23.008 --> 28:26.710
To kill witches.

28:28.880 --> 28:32.800
Every single one
without Balcoin blood.

28:42.478 --> 28:44.194
What's happening?

28:44.196 --> 28:47.281
I feel like I'm burning
from the inside.

28:51.662 --> 28:52.896
How can you kill
witches?

28:53.255 --> 28:55.338
Because they're weak.
And their weaknesses

28:55.340 --> 28:58.058
kept us victims
for 2,000 years.

28:58.060 --> 29:00.644
But the time's finally
come for a cleansing.

29:00.646 --> 29:02.846
Let's scorch the earth.

29:02.848 --> 29:05.732
Let's burn
the weak blooded.

29:05.734 --> 29:07.684
And clear the way.

29:08.969 --> 29:10.036
For what?

29:10.038 --> 29:12.906
The other Balcoin
children.

29:12.908 --> 29:15.358
4 more born
in other towns,

29:15.360 --> 29:18.128
raised in other circles.

29:18.130 --> 29:19.663
And they're coming here
to join you.

29:19.665 --> 29:21.981
Jake's grandfather
was right.

29:21.983 --> 29:24.885
You want to build
a circle of Balcoin witches.

29:24.887 --> 29:27.404
The perfect circle,
the purest race.

29:27.406 --> 29:30.090
Together you will be
a weapon more powerful

29:30.092 --> 29:32.542
than any crystal skull.

29:32.544 --> 29:37.013
You'll be able to destroy
the witch hunters once and for all.

29:37.015 --> 29:38.832
And anything that
stands in your way.

29:38.834 --> 29:41.051
We can change the world.

29:42.136 --> 29:43.436
As a family.

29:43.438 --> 29:45.272
No!

29:48.025 --> 29:49.309
Adam!

29:49.311 --> 29:50.944
Aah!

29:50.946 --> 29:53.780
The skull's
burning him.

29:53.782 --> 29:55.565
It's burning
all of them.

30:01.455 --> 30:03.523
Aah!

30:08.913 --> 30:11.364
My dark magic,
it's not strong enough.

30:17.138 --> 30:19.256
What do we do?

30:19.258 --> 30:21.191
I need
your power.

30:31.402 --> 30:34.053
Cassie,
what are you doing?

30:38.142 --> 30:39.943
What are you doing?

30:39.945 --> 30:41.528
Killing you.

30:54.875 --> 30:57.927
Together we're stronger
than he is.

31:01.215 --> 31:02.248
What are you doing?

31:02.250 --> 31:03.516
Reversing the spell.

31:03.518 --> 31:04.768
Stop!

31:20.451 --> 31:21.651
Ahh!

31:21.653 --> 31:22.869
Aah!

31:26.440 --> 31:28.992
Ahh!

31:36.785 --> 31:39.552
Stop fighting it.

31:41.672 --> 31:43.973
We share
the same blood.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.727
We're the same.

32:40.585 --> 32:44.504
Look, none of this
should have ever happened.

32:46.173 --> 32:49.275
I just...I wanted so badly
to believe in him.

32:49.277 --> 32:51.744
John Blackwell
fooled all of us.

32:51.746 --> 32:53.680
Yeah, but I should have
known it was wrong.

32:53.682 --> 32:57.884
And I am sorrier than any
of you will ever know.

32:57.886 --> 33:00.152
That's behind us.

33:00.154 --> 33:02.105
Now we have to destroy
the skull

33:02.107 --> 33:04.007
so nothing like this
can ever happen again.

33:04.009 --> 33:06.409
How? I thought it was
indestructible.

33:06.411 --> 33:07.710
We could surround it
with lead

33:07.712 --> 33:10.546
to block its power and so
no one can ever detect it

33:10.548 --> 33:12.932
and, I don't know, throw it
in the middle of the ocean.

33:12.934 --> 33:14.500
I've used it before.

33:14.502 --> 33:18.438
Its power is more than
I have ever experienced.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.723
It's dark and seductive.

33:20.725 --> 33:23.526
Look, I don't want
to go near it.

33:25.363 --> 33:26.729
Fine, I'll do it.

33:26.731 --> 33:29.065
Definitely not you.

33:29.067 --> 33:30.583
Then who?

33:30.585 --> 33:32.485
Ex-witch hunter,

33:32.487 --> 33:34.137
evil princess number two?

33:34.139 --> 33:35.788
Adam.

33:35.790 --> 33:37.707
No one's more reliable.

33:39.277 --> 33:42.211
Thank you for coming
to save us today.

33:43.330 --> 33:45.298
I was useless.

33:45.300 --> 33:47.817
Blackwell's power
was too strong.

33:47.819 --> 33:49.919
Yeah, Adam should
ditch the skull.

33:49.921 --> 33:53.706
All those moral merit badges
should add up to something.

33:53.708 --> 33:55.091
Ok, I'll do it.

33:55.093 --> 34:00.229
Creating this horrible thing
is what broke our circle.

34:00.231 --> 34:01.764
But we can't stay that way.

34:01.766 --> 34:03.816
Being divided is
what Blackwell wanted.

34:03.818 --> 34:05.501
You want to rebind
the circle?

34:05.503 --> 34:07.070
Maybe we
shouldn't.

34:07.072 --> 34:09.739
With Eben gone
and Blackwell,

34:09.741 --> 34:12.108
maybe we should
just lay low for a while.

34:12.110 --> 34:13.960
People, ghosts,
demons,

34:13.962 --> 34:16.462
they all started coming after us
once we were bound.

34:16.464 --> 34:18.181
It might be safer
if we're not.

34:18.183 --> 34:19.782
Well, we can still
be together,

34:19.784 --> 34:22.351
even if we're not bound.

34:22.353 --> 34:23.703
When you showed up
on the boat

34:23.705 --> 34:25.838
and saved my ass,

34:25.840 --> 34:29.108
I knew we were connected,
even if it's not official anymore.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.860
Ok, look, Blackwell said there
are more Balcoins coming.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.630
Everything he did,
everyone he killed,

34:34.632 --> 34:36.716
or tried to,

34:36.717 --> 34:38.935
it's all because
he wanted Diana and I

34:38.937 --> 34:41.437
to be a part of
a Balcoin circle.

34:42.606 --> 34:46.391
But the six of us
being bound together,

34:46.393 --> 34:48.594
I mean, that's our
greatest protection

34:48.596 --> 34:50.096
from letting that
ever happen.

34:50.098 --> 34:52.398
I can't.

34:53.449 --> 34:56.235
I'm sorry. I...

34:56.237 --> 34:59.072
I'm leaving town,
so I guess that's it.

35:00.491 --> 35:02.325
Diana, wait.

35:02.327 --> 35:04.110
Diana, wait!

35:04.112 --> 35:05.995
I have to get
away from here,

35:05.997 --> 35:07.797
from the memories
of all this.

35:07.799 --> 35:11.784
I'm--I'm sorry
about Charles.

35:11.786 --> 35:13.219
He saved all of us.

35:13.221 --> 35:15.388
He also did some
terrible things,

35:15.390 --> 35:17.590
some unforgivable
things.

35:17.592 --> 35:19.876
Please stay.

35:19.878 --> 35:23.679
Bound or not,
you are my sister.

35:24.982 --> 35:27.867
And you are the only family
I have left.

35:27.869 --> 35:29.819
No matter where
I go,

35:29.821 --> 35:31.854
that is never
gonna change.

35:31.856 --> 35:34.290
But I have got to
get out of here.

35:34.292 --> 35:36.359
I've lost
everything.

35:36.361 --> 35:37.860
I honestly don't even know
who I am anymore.

35:37.862 --> 35:40.463
No one understands that
better than me.

35:40.465 --> 35:43.666
Ok, that's exactly how I felt
when I came to Chance Harbor,

35:43.668 --> 35:46.369
but you--you took care of me.

35:46.371 --> 35:49.505
Now, please, just let me
help you now.

35:49.507 --> 35:54.343
I know you had to activate my
dark magic for us to get free,

35:54.345 --> 35:56.212
but now that I've felt
its power,

35:56.214 --> 35:58.014
I never want
to feel it again.

35:58.016 --> 36:00.800
I cannot get away
from dark magic

36:00.802 --> 36:02.435
and be with you
at the same time.

36:02.437 --> 36:04.604
I'm sorry.

36:19.620 --> 36:21.988
Hey.
Come on.

36:21.990 --> 36:23.906
Let me take you
home.

36:23.908 --> 36:25.374
Tempting.

36:25.376 --> 36:26.876
But I have plans.

36:26.878 --> 36:28.694
Really?
Yep.

36:28.696 --> 36:30.830
Between being kidnapped by
witch hunters

36:30.832 --> 36:33.032
and almost dying,
you made plans?

36:33.034 --> 36:34.800
Yes.

36:34.802 --> 36:38.588
Maybe some other time.

36:47.714 --> 36:52.818
Yeah...Definitely
another time.

37:12.422 --> 37:14.707
Ahem. Hey.

37:18.011 --> 37:20.746
I didn't know if
you'd actually be here.

37:20.748 --> 37:23.633
Neither did I.

37:25.252 --> 37:27.186
You sure about this?

37:27.188 --> 37:30.389
Yes.

37:31.775 --> 37:34.193
Are you sure?

37:47.040 --> 37:48.457
What the hell's
going on?

37:48.459 --> 37:49.558
We're celebrating.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.077
What, exactly?

37:51.079 --> 37:55.548
Being alive. And having our solo
magic back, of course.

37:59.137 --> 38:00.336
Get dressed,
we're going out.

38:01.922 --> 38:03.723
I know that one
fits you.

38:03.725 --> 38:05.591
Faye, it's Sunday night
in Chance Harbor.

38:05.593 --> 38:07.093
There's nothing going on.

38:07.095 --> 38:08.728
You've got it
all wrong.

38:08.730 --> 38:10.062
Think big.

38:10.064 --> 38:12.464
We have solo magic.

38:12.466 --> 38:15.467
We can make this town whatever
we want.

38:15.469 --> 38:16.702
Hmm?

38:16.704 --> 38:18.904
Ok, I like it.

38:18.906 --> 38:22.942
So our new motto is less
being burned at the stake

38:22.944 --> 38:24.310
and more fun.

38:24.312 --> 38:25.528
Mm-hmm.

38:30.484 --> 38:32.952
To solo magic.

38:33.987 --> 38:35.171
About damn time.

38:35.173 --> 38:37.957
Who is that?

38:37.959 --> 38:39.925
The hot taxi driver
I ordered.

38:39.927 --> 38:41.627
Yeah, of course.
