WEBVTT

00:07.424 --> 00:08.633
[cell door slams]

00:08.717 --> 00:10.051
[theme song playing]

00:57.098 --> 00:58.850
[cell door slams]

01:14.699 --> 01:16.242
[cell door slams]

01:30.006 --> 01:31.007
[barber] Next group.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.176
Up against the wall, inmates.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.887
These lice ain't gonna clear out
on their own.

01:35.970 --> 01:36.846
[Helen] Uh... Chrome dome.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.436
Next in line, let's go. Chop-chop.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.688
No, please. No, please. I beg you.

01:45.772 --> 01:49.609
I told you. I am not supposed to be here.
I am an MCC executive.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.361
I don't care
if you're Princess fucking Di.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.737
Still gotta clear your lice.

01:52.821 --> 01:56.032
Hey, Princess Diana is dead.
All she wanted was a normal life.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.493
Please, please don't do this.
Please, don't do this.

01:58.576 --> 02:02.622
[cries] Oh, God! Please, please.
You are making a huge mistake.

02:02.705 --> 02:06.835
[chuckles] He really is!
But I'm enjoying it so much.

02:09.546 --> 02:12.590
You sure it's her?
'Cause that one's forehead looks bigger.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.509
[Costa] No, you can't look
at the forehead.

02:14.592 --> 02:17.178
You gotta look at the nose.
See how the nostrils match up?

02:17.262 --> 02:19.806
[Miller] I could never date a bald chick.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.015
Amber Rose?

02:21.099 --> 02:23.434
Oh, fuck. That's right.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.524
Yo, G.I. Jane. Lucky day.
Warden says you're free to go.

02:29.607 --> 02:30.483
[snickers]

02:30.567 --> 02:32.318
Might have been luckier five minutes ago.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.404
But she's still a menace to society!

02:34.487 --> 02:36.948
You are so fucking fired!

02:38.533 --> 02:42.203
Oh, look on the bright side, hon,
at least the lice are gone.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.830
Up top anyway...

02:44.706 --> 02:45.790
[Big Boo and Ouija chuckle]

02:45.874 --> 02:48.835
[Jack] On behalf of the board
and everyone here at MCC,

02:48.918 --> 02:51.546
I would like to extend
our deepest apologies.

02:51.629 --> 02:54.966
But, if I might point out,
the silver lining here,

02:55.049 --> 02:58.219
it's that your unique,
first-hand experience

02:58.303 --> 03:02.891
will be invaluable to MCC's mission
of innovation and reform.

03:02.974 --> 03:07.353
Really? You think that you can buy me off
with large produce?

03:07.437 --> 03:08.855
And I know for a fact that

03:08.938 --> 03:11.983
that is a middle tier basket because
the top tier one has a dragon fruit in it.

03:12.817 --> 03:13.860
Bad form, Jack.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.988
[sighs] I know
what you went through was rough--

03:17.071 --> 03:19.657
[scoffs] No, no.
I don't think you actually do.

03:19.741 --> 03:23.119
Not unless you were witness to a possum
giving birth in a shower drain,

03:23.202 --> 03:26.706
or had a mob of angry sociopaths try
to stone you to death with their shoes.

03:26.789 --> 03:31.961
And let's not forget my luxurious,
four-day vacation at FDC Cleveland,

03:32.045 --> 03:34.797
a place so shitty even the pubic lice
have opioid addictions.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.508
Don't women shave everything
down there now?

03:39.177 --> 03:40.261
Really?

03:40.345 --> 03:41.179
[sighs]

03:41.262 --> 03:45.350
-We're working to improve conditions.
-I am sure that you are.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.936
In the meantime, you have two choices.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.855
Option one, I sell my story to the press,

03:50.939 --> 03:54.150
and I sue MCC for $10 million,
plus damages.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.526
Or option two.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.780
You offer me a considerable
upfront bonus for pain and suffering,

03:58.863 --> 04:00.531
and you fire your buddy Stan

04:00.615 --> 04:03.534
and you hire me as senior VP
at triple my current salary.

04:03.618 --> 04:06.120
Linda, please. Be reasonable.

04:06.788 --> 04:11.084
I think, considering the PR nightmare
that MCC is in, I am well within reason.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.418
The only question is,

04:12.502 --> 04:14.879
do you want me on the outside
pouring gasoline on this fire,

04:14.963 --> 04:17.674
or in here, helping you put it out?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.801
[indistinct chatter]

04:25.223 --> 04:27.100
Keep it moving, inmate.

04:27.183 --> 04:29.560
You've got lunch for five more minutes.

04:30.395 --> 04:34.107
When you're finished,
that's your cell over there. 102.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.159
May I sit here?

04:45.785 --> 04:46.703
Please.

04:50.540 --> 04:54.794
I can give you the 411
on these Max psychos.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.673
They do that to you?

04:59.173 --> 05:02.051
[grunts softly] COs.
Payback for shooting Humps.

05:02.885 --> 05:03.803
Shit!

05:04.762 --> 05:08.141
You guys, this is like in <i>Breakfast Club.</i>

05:08.224 --> 05:11.227
One kid from every group in school.

05:12.645 --> 05:17.191
Oh, my God. You have a toothbrush!
Sweet Jesus!

05:17.275 --> 05:18.359
The fuck?

05:18.443 --> 05:20.570
Bitches here steal
all the new girls' kits.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.281
We haven't washed our hair
or brushed our teeth in, like, forever.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.116
So they got something
against good hygiene?

05:25.199 --> 05:27.160
No. It's like D-block initiation.

05:27.243 --> 05:28.661
Oh, like in a sorority.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.540
Only instead of playing beer pong
and getting date-raped,

05:32.623 --> 05:34.917
you get shivved and regular raped.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.587
[moans] Oh, God! It so good.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.590
Okay, it's bad enough you using it,
you don't gotta fuck it.

05:41.174 --> 05:45.053
You try having morning sickness all day
and not being able to brush.

05:45.136 --> 05:48.848
My teeth are rotting
like that bulimic girl from the library.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.517
With all that puking,
you'd at least think she'd be skinny.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.270
Dude, you got puke teeth
all over my brush?

05:54.353 --> 05:57.190
I still can't believe they let you fuck
in the visitation room.

05:57.273 --> 06:00.234
It was by the vending machines.
I was very discreet.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.820
Okay. Knocked up and a bag of chips.

06:02.904 --> 06:03.988
[laughing]

06:06.407 --> 06:10.661
You think I don't notice you cookies?
'Cause believe me, I do.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.747
Daddy's got eyes everywhere.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.711
I didn't even get to clean my tongue.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.214
That little bitch
runs the toothbrush game here?

06:21.297 --> 06:24.550
No, they work for Barbara.
She's a D-block boss.

06:24.634 --> 06:28.763
-Ain't no gangsters named Barbara.
-Shh! I wouldn't say that too loud.

06:28.846 --> 06:31.766
The last girl that crossed her
got hot Milky Way thrown in her face.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.477
-That shit sticks and burns.
-[Lorna] I like Milky Way.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.730
Not burning hot in my face,
but room temperature, in my mouth.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.857
So that's it?
We part of Barbara's gang now?

06:39.941 --> 06:44.028
If it makes you feel any better,
I heard C-block boss is even worse.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.156
The only good way out
is gettin' moved to Florida.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.661
Technically, it's B block.
Neutral territory.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.622
Okay, so how we get in? We don't. Florida don't let
normal people like us in.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.878
Only, grannies, trannies and loonies.

07:02.171 --> 07:05.341
Well, don't look at me. I might be crazy,
but I'm not Florida crazy.

07:05.424 --> 07:08.761
Well, like it or not, we D block now.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.308
Look at you.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.936
Jesus, has it been that long?

07:17.019 --> 07:18.229
Yes.

07:18.312 --> 07:21.691
This is my colleague, Ms. Goldstein.
She'll be handing your case for the firm.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.568
Hi. Please call me Michelle.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.278
It's good to see you again, kid.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.071
-Hmm. Okay. Uh...
-All right.

07:27.697 --> 07:32.076
It's not the daddy-daughter dance.
Yeah. I'm just here for the lawyering.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.580
Maybe if you'd taken me up on that
five years ago,

07:35.663 --> 07:38.416
you wouldn't be here
in the first place, right?

07:38.499 --> 07:40.793
Maybe if you hadn't left,
I wouldn't have turned to heroin.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.003
But I guess we'll never know.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.799
See, the kid's got my sense of humor
with Orphan Annie's face.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.386
You remember, Nick, you used
to drive us crazy with those songs?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.014
Yeah. I thought
maybe if I sang loud enough that my real parents
might just turn up and rescue me.

07:55.725 --> 07:56.934
I hate to be a buzzkill,

07:57.018 --> 08:00.480
but I think we should really dive
into your possible charges.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.898
Now based on recent precedent,

08:01.981 --> 08:04.192
the US Attorney's office
isn't gonna have much trouble indicting all of you on riot charges.

08:06.569 --> 08:10.990
I had no idea what the hell was going on.
I was just along for the ride.

08:11.073 --> 08:12.200
Good to know.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.661
Because our defense will likely hinge
on the government's inability to prove

08:15.745 --> 08:19.499
that you had knowledge that your actions
would be in furtherance of vandalism,

08:19.582 --> 08:23.794
injury to property, or unlawful assembly
within a federal prison.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.671
Told you she was good, didn't I?

08:29.175 --> 08:31.177
Oh. Uh... [chuckles]

08:31.302 --> 08:33.596
It's terrific. [chuckles]

08:33.679 --> 08:34.597
Uh...

08:34.680 --> 08:38.434
Well, I mean, just like my piano teacher,
and the French tutor.

08:39.185 --> 08:42.813
You know, I've always been curious,
uh, does the hourly rate...

08:42.897 --> 08:47.902
Does it go up or down when the hired help
doubles as your side piece?

08:47.985 --> 08:51.864
Michelle happens to be one of the best
criminal litigators in New York.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.617
So she's not pro-ing your bono?

08:54.700 --> 08:55.785
Watch your mouth!

08:55.868 --> 08:57.703
Your father and I are engaged.

08:59.121 --> 09:03.584
We're getting married in November.
We also have two children together.

09:03.668 --> 09:07.088
Sammi's five and, uh,
Atticus just turned three.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.469
Nicky, I wanted to say something about it
over the phone,

09:13.553 --> 09:15.972
but I thought you would, you know...

09:16.055 --> 09:18.599
You know what? You know what?
You know what?

09:19.225 --> 09:22.895
I was wrong. Okay?
This whole thing? Big mistake.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.482
Les, thank you for stopping by.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.526
Michelle, no hard feelings.

09:28.609 --> 09:32.321
I'm sure you're a great lawyer,
and you have a wonderful vocabulary,

09:32.405 --> 09:35.783
and you're going to make
an excellent trophy wife.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.412
You... [chuckles and clicks tongue]

09:39.495 --> 09:41.455
Okay, guard! I'm done here.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.875
Kid, don't get bogged down by old baggage.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.836
You're in real deep shit.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.964
Nicky, you need good representation.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.217
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

09:54.885 --> 09:59.724
Take it slow out there, Berlin.
We don't need any more injuries.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.434
Pass.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.312
Pass.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.983
If I weren't so happy to see you,
I'd kill you myself.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.484
What the hell were you thinking?

10:10.568 --> 10:12.236
It's complicated.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.865
Our affection for Roman Polanski films
is complicated.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.700
Suicide is for cowards.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.827
You don't understand, Red.

10:19.910 --> 10:23.247
I got history in this place.

10:23.331 --> 10:27.918
There's people here spent three decades
waitin' to take a crack at me.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.880
Since when is Frieda Berlin afraid?

10:30.963 --> 10:34.508
[scoffs] It's not fear, it's pragmatism.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.385
Like my daddy always said,

10:36.469 --> 10:38.429
"The cyanide pill won't work

10:38.512 --> 10:41.891
unless you take it before the commies
bust in your door."

10:41.974 --> 10:46.020
Well, the commie is right here
and I'm telling you to keep fighting.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.648
-Oh, shit. Frieda! Are you okay?
-Shit.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.777
I got it. I got it. It's okay.
She's fine. It's okay.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.445
Did you hurt yourself?

10:54.528 --> 10:57.448
I'm fine. Just stiff is all.

10:57.531 --> 11:00.618
Bullshit. I see what you're up to.
You put that back right now.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.203
Leave me alone, Red.

11:02.286 --> 11:05.665
I am not going to stand by and watch you
do this to yourself. Or to me.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.417
You have problems here,
you find a creative solution,

11:08.501 --> 11:11.003
like you've done for the past 30 years.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.588
It's different this time.

11:12.671 --> 11:15.424
Or maybe you're not trying hard enough.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.509
[grunts]

11:21.222 --> 11:22.848
[music playing on radio]

11:26.143 --> 11:27.228
[Carol] Hey, Frieda...

11:28.896 --> 11:33.067
your dad's hot and all,
but I got other plans.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.152
Hope you don't mind. [sighs]

11:35.986 --> 11:37.822
Now that is human perfection.

11:38.614 --> 11:39.824
Right, Frieda?

11:39.907 --> 11:40.741
[chuckles]

11:41.242 --> 11:42.118
Sure.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.206
[music stops]

11:53.337 --> 11:56.048
What the hell? I paid less than that
for four last time.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.092
You got a problem with my prices?

11:58.175 --> 12:00.386
No, we're good. Right, Tyler? Come on.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.887
[tsks] This some bullshit, man.

12:01.971 --> 12:02.847
[chuckles]

12:02.930 --> 12:06.725
Hey, Carol, maybe you ought to go back
to dealing in the showers.

12:06.809 --> 12:10.855
You kidding? Finding your hidey-hole is
the best thing that ever happened to me.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.150
The shower steam
made my hair look like shit.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.278
Now come on,
let's look at the rest of today's haul.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.286
Damn, Frieda! We're killing it!

12:25.369 --> 12:28.372
Oh! And you know I have a sweet tooth.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.957
Just one.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.752
-Oh! How much for a jawbreaker?
-They're not for sale. But you got so many.
I like watching the colors change.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.717
Do you now?

12:40.759 --> 12:43.095
Well, come on in. Come on in.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.184
[chuckles]

12:51.604 --> 12:53.439
Do I look like Willy Fucking Wonka to you?

12:53.522 --> 12:54.690
No, ma'am.

12:54.773 --> 12:56.233
This place look like a candy store?

12:58.110 --> 13:00.029
-Ow.
-[Carol] Frieda, hold her hair for me.

13:02.865 --> 13:03.782
Ow!

13:03.866 --> 13:05.493
Now open your fucking mouth

13:05.576 --> 13:09.413
before I shove this so far down
your goddamn throat you give birth to it.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.251
Go on. Start sucking. -[choking]
-[Carol laughs]

13:17.963 --> 13:20.466
Jesus, Carol! You're such a little psycho!

13:20.549 --> 13:23.886
Bad enough you're stealing my customers,
you don't gotta go kill 'em too.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.430
Yeah, you better fuckin' run, Greeley!

13:26.514 --> 13:28.349
Sorry ladies, shop's closed.

13:28.432 --> 13:30.518
Piss off, Flunky.
I'm here to see my sister.

13:30.601 --> 13:34.063
Didn't anyone tell you?
Family reunion's been canceled this year.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.815
It's funny,
because Mom's coming to visit me later,

13:36.899 --> 13:40.069
just like she did last week
and the week before.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.404
She doesn't send her love, by the way.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.074
What do you want, Barbie?

13:45.157 --> 13:47.868
I mean, besides an ass
that don't look like a pizza box?

13:47.952 --> 13:51.789
I want you and Gnarly Davidson
to step off my H game.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.167
[chuckles] Sorry, sis, but you ain't
the boss of me no more.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.128
We had a deal, Care.
D block gets smack and weed.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.214
Cunt block gets rock and pills.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.262
Look at yourself, Carol. You're a child.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.056
Amateur like you
got no business selling horse.

14:09.139 --> 14:12.017
You'd be better off dealing ex-lax
to the biddies in Florida.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.272
Frieda, you gonna sit there
with your thumb up your butt

14:16.355 --> 14:18.065
or you gonna do something about this?

14:18.148 --> 14:21.235
All right, ladies,
it's time for you gals to move it along.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.444
Okay.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.113
[laughing]

14:30.536 --> 14:32.246
Come on, Frieda.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.540
You and me got some beef to look at.

14:35.165 --> 14:39.044
Oh, my God! Ah. Oh, God.
I love a man with a big bush.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.214
Oh, God, look at that little dickie-doo.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.009
[chuckles] He's all alone in the forest.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.260
[chomping sounds]

14:48.846 --> 14:50.931
And how are tensions
between C and D block?

14:51.015 --> 14:52.141
'Cause last time I was here,

14:52.224 --> 14:55.352
we were losing fingers
faster than a Romanian leper colony.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.354
Gang activity's down to a low simmer.

14:57.438 --> 15:00.316
Just some stabbings,
couple of missing toes...

15:01.567 --> 15:02.943
What ya playing for, Carol?

15:03.694 --> 15:07.031
Oh, you know, gambling's illegal.
We just play for braggin' rights.

15:07.114 --> 15:10.618
Of course. The love of the game.
You staying out of trouble?

15:11.452 --> 15:12.369
Always.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.706
You got any idea how long the FBI's
gonna be using our break room?

15:15.789 --> 15:18.250
-I got yogurts in that fridge.
-Expiration dates are bullshit.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.376
You've been missed.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.420
Also bullshit. But I'll take it.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.255
At least there was never a riot
on my watch.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.591
Keep the gangs in check,
keep your guys in check,

15:25.674 --> 15:28.177
and don't bother me
unless there's a death.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.762
What about MCC protocols?

15:29.845 --> 15:33.307
Listen, the best thing you can do
is think of yourself as a hotel maid.

15:33.390 --> 15:36.727
No rearranging the furniture
and no asking questions,

15:36.810 --> 15:40.439
no matter what kind of freaky shit
you find on the nightstand. Got it?

15:40.522 --> 15:44.068
From here on in, surface cleaning only.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.613
Now you gonna tip me bigger
if I look sexy in my uniform?

15:47.696 --> 15:49.073
Analogy's over, Ricky.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.700
What more do you people need?

15:52.493 --> 15:55.746
You've seen the video of him torturing us.

15:55.829 --> 16:00.042
That monster should be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.671
So, it would be fair to say
you hated CO Piscatella?

16:05.464 --> 16:07.591
Look at what he did to me!

16:08.550 --> 16:12.846
I'm like a doll that's been wrecked
by a demented child.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.515
He should rot in hell.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.850
Then you admit
to wanting CO Piscatella dead?

16:16.934 --> 16:19.603
Why? You have a connection to Make-A-Wish?

16:19.687 --> 16:21.271
[Michelson] We'll do you one better.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.988
You're kidding. [gasps]

16:34.743 --> 16:40.416
Wait. You think I have
something to do with this?

16:40.499 --> 16:42.918
That would be the logical conclusion,

16:43.002 --> 16:46.839
seeing as how Piscatella's body was found
in the same place we found you.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.843
And you sure do seem
to have plenty of motive.

16:53.887 --> 16:58.308
One rolling cart for Hayes,
and a mop for Gonzales.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.477
Cops come down on me
if this shit goes missing

17:00.561 --> 17:03.230
so try and keep your noses
as clean as the floors, okay?

17:03.313 --> 17:06.942
Let's pick up the pace.
C block's getting filthier by the second.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.278
Why we gotta mop enemy territory?

17:09.361 --> 17:12.072
Guess they're too good
to clean their own shit.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.700
Think it'd be wise
to keep your mouth shut, Diaz.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.952
Anyone else have a question?

17:17.745 --> 17:19.621
-[Black Cindy] Mmm-mmm.
-No, sir.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.792
Let's hit it. [Black Cindy clears throat]

17:28.672 --> 17:31.133
This place is way too serious.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.719
If we get jumped, we use these as weapons.

17:33.802 --> 17:34.970
[grunts]

17:35.054 --> 17:38.640
You don't think that they would hurt
a pregnant lady, do you?

17:38.724 --> 17:41.018
Sir? Sir?

17:41.101 --> 17:42.895
You know she's a girl, right?

17:42.978 --> 17:44.646
Hey, right. Um...

17:44.730 --> 17:47.107
Miss? Ms. Daddy?

17:47.191 --> 17:51.987
I know I'm not showing yet,
but I am indeed with child.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.407
Jesus. You cookies ever stop whining?

17:58.368 --> 18:02.289
I'd never put my D girls in danger.
Especially not ones so pretty.

18:02.372 --> 18:06.210
Yeah, I'm gonna look real good
when my face turns black-and-blue.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.378
Bruised fruit tastes the sweetest.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.548
Hey, Duarte, list.

18:26.480 --> 18:30.567
I can walk on my own now. Really.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.070
My legs feel much stronger.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.822
If you say so.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.283
[groans]

18:38.367 --> 18:41.495
Dagnabbit, Berlin!
I knew this would happen.

18:41.578 --> 18:44.581
-You hurt anything?
-Oh, just my ego.

18:44.665 --> 18:48.961
[sighs] I guess
I can't do anything right anymore.

18:50.629 --> 18:54.049
You know, that negative attitude
is not helping your depression.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.223
According to scientific studies,

19:01.306 --> 19:04.643
the best thing you can do
to improve your mood

19:04.726 --> 19:08.021
is write lists of all the things
you're grateful for.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.233
I don't have paper or a pen.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.235
For what?

19:13.819 --> 19:14.653
[chuckles softly]

19:14.736 --> 19:16.947
For the gratitude list.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.658
I'd like to try it.

19:20.909 --> 19:21.952
[sighs]

19:22.911 --> 19:23.829
All right.

19:24.580 --> 19:28.458
What you should be grateful for is
the fact that I'm letting you borrow this.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.753
Don't even think about
trying to kill yourself.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.964
This is a felt-tip, it won't work, got it?

19:34.882 --> 19:36.508
Scout's honor.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.350
[cell door closes]

20:02.242 --> 20:07.206
They think we killed Piscatella.
I need to warn the girls.

20:11.501 --> 20:12.794
Yo, Aunt Jemima,

20:12.878 --> 20:14.963
chill the fuck out or those COs
will be up our asses

20:15.047 --> 20:17.090
faster than Mikey O'Brien's pinky finger.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.520
What the hell is she doing?

20:30.604 --> 20:35.025
[mouthing] Piscatella is dead.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.403
Oh, Red is really losing it.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.033
[sighs]

20:47.913 --> 20:49.164
First word?

20:52.542 --> 20:54.878
-Get up. Move.
-All right.

21:02.636 --> 21:03.929
Cross.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.349
Cock.

21:07.432 --> 21:10.227
Penis? Penis. Peeing?

21:10.310 --> 21:13.021
Pee? The first syllable is "P."

21:16.358 --> 21:17.359
[sighs]

21:18.068 --> 21:22.698
-Driving? Car crash? DUI?
-Shut up. You're distracting me.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.784
[Badison] What you should do is
let me help you 'cause you suck at this,

21:25.867 --> 21:28.453
and I'm pretty much
a charades savant, so...

21:30.831 --> 21:32.291
[Red] Piss?

21:34.209 --> 21:36.211
Car...

21:36.295 --> 21:39.589
Peeing? Urination? Urination drive?

21:39.673 --> 21:41.258
<i>Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

21:41.341 --> 21:43.885
Damn. How do you do that every time?

21:48.890 --> 21:52.394
[Frieda] "Giant killed. Cops framing us."

21:52.769 --> 21:53.854
Hmm.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.904
Shit.

22:06.283 --> 22:09.119
Oh! Oh, Burt! Oh, God!

22:09.202 --> 22:12.164
Burt is the least of our problems.
The stash is gone.

22:12.873 --> 22:17.794
Oh, God. I swear, I will kill
that flat-ass bitch with my bare hands.

22:17.878 --> 22:18.879
[grunts]

22:18.962 --> 22:20.213
[breathing heavily]

22:20.922 --> 22:22.215
[grunts, shouts]

22:22.299 --> 22:23.925
Carol, calm down.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.720
Last sister you whacked
landed your ass in here.

22:26.803 --> 22:29.306
How many times do I have to tell you
Barbie's the one who did it?

22:29.389 --> 22:30.932
I just brought Debbie to the lake.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.309
-We need to be strategic.
-No.

22:32.392 --> 22:35.479
What we need to do is
to teach those D-block bitches a lesson.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.898
-Show them they can't fuck with us.
-Agreed.

22:37.981 --> 22:40.984
But shoot a deer in the gut,
you wind up chasing it down for days.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.446
Shoot it in the heart,
you're eating venison by dinner.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.700
[chuckling]

22:50.660 --> 22:52.829
Frieda, meeting you
was the luckiest day I had

22:52.913 --> 22:57.375
since I found that $50 bill
on the bathroom floor of Dairy Queen.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.482
-[door buzzes]
-[indistinct chatter]

23:22.776 --> 23:26.321
Damn. Look at this place.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.824
They got TV?

23:28.907 --> 23:32.327
Shit. It's like we in the VIP section
at the club.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.288
[Dayanara] That's 'cause the C-block birds
got all the good jobs

23:35.372 --> 23:37.332
wrapping cheese for Grace Grocers.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.960
So they sit here feeding their faces

23:40.043 --> 23:42.838
while we wipe their floors
for 12 cents an hour

23:42.921 --> 23:45.006
just 'cause we're stuck in D block?

23:45.090 --> 23:48.093
Mmm-hmm. It's called economic segregation.

23:48.176 --> 23:50.679
We live on the wrong side of the tracks.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.139
[retching]

23:55.642 --> 23:57.227
Watch your back, Flaca.

23:57.310 --> 24:00.021
-Do I know you?
-No, but we know you.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.607
-You're the chick from YouTube, right?
-You saw that?

24:02.691 --> 24:06.903
-We love your shit. Big fans.
-No, I liked the other one better.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.156
Not me. I find you more relatable.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.534
Too bad your stuck
with the douche-block trash.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.870
Gonna make life here a whole lot harder.

24:19.708 --> 24:22.752
-Looks like you missed a spot.
-[mouthing] I'm so sorry.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.838
And they call themselves fans.

24:24.921 --> 24:28.175
Seriously, that's, like, one full month
of contour powder.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.510
Hey, guys, check it out.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.347
[Black Cindy] A shower kit...

24:38.185 --> 24:41.771
Well, don't look at me.
Unless you want me to puke on her.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.607
Tattoo artist beat you to it.

24:43.690 --> 24:48.612
Oh, I say we send the famous one.
Girl's probably president of her fan club.

24:48.695 --> 24:51.239
My fans know less is more.

24:52.407 --> 24:55.493
Better idea, we borrow one from Mendoza.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.171
Oh, Jesus!

25:25.273 --> 25:27.275
[woman speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

25:28.109 --> 25:29.653
[breathes deeply]

25:42.374 --> 25:44.668
[woman speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

25:45.835 --> 25:49.631
Oh, shit. They're taking Frieda
for questioning.

25:49.714 --> 25:50.799
I'm too late.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.885
It's your own fault
for not using my help with Charades.

25:53.969 --> 25:57.639
Everyone knows you don't use "car"
when you wanna say "ca."

25:57.722 --> 26:00.558
This is not good at all.
Frieda doesn't have the information.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.144
She won't know how to defend herself.

26:03.228 --> 26:06.398
Well, if you want help
getting the message out,

26:06.481 --> 26:08.608
the offer's still on the...

26:10.777 --> 26:14.447
I refuse to take help from a girl
whose greatest claim to fame

26:14.531 --> 26:16.866
is blowing a lesser Wahlberg.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.034
[scoffs]

26:18.118 --> 26:22.956
Well, unless that fur-fringed crystal ball
of yours can send psychic messages,

26:23.039 --> 26:24.624
I don't think you got much of a choice.

26:25.208 --> 26:29.754
And everybody in my neighborhood,
guys and girls, has blown a Wahlberg.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.590
Not a big deal. There's a lot of 'em.

26:44.686 --> 26:48.189
-What you doing here?
-Cleaning up after your happy hour.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.151
Your mom knows you took a plea?

26:51.234 --> 26:54.195
Look, I don't need
any guilt trips from you, okay?

26:55.113 --> 26:58.867
You think I don't feel bad enough?
I can't sleep at night. Everything hurts.

26:58.950 --> 27:04.331
When I finally manage to close my eyes,
all I can see is his fucking droopy face.

27:04.414 --> 27:07.208
-I know you didn't mean for him to--
-That doesn't matter right now.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.211
The only reason I came up here is
'cause I need to ask you for a favor.

27:11.671 --> 27:15.300
-We lost all our shower stuff to the--
-Step away from the door, Mendoza.

27:15.383 --> 27:19.054
Carol doesn't take kindly
to fraternizing with the help.

27:24.351 --> 27:28.104
And, bitch, don't you even think
about stealing my brown Pantene.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.898
That shit's getting discontinued.

27:39.115 --> 27:41.159
Piscatella was killed in the pool.

27:41.242 --> 27:44.871
-You mind saying that again?
-Seriously, Creech? It's one sentence.

27:44.954 --> 27:47.248
Girl, you know how much paint
I huffed in middle school?

27:47.332 --> 27:52.921
That guard, Piscatella...
Tell them he was killed in the pool.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.181
Piscatella was killed in the pool.

28:08.311 --> 28:10.730
They say Piscatella got killed
in the pool.

28:13.024 --> 28:14.776
For real? Piscatella's dead?

28:15.443 --> 28:19.572
Why so sad, Curly Sue? Guard dies,
you should throw a fucking party.

28:19.656 --> 28:24.494
Yeah, uh, I'll wait to order the cake
until after I don't go down for murder.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.621
[sighs]

28:27.539 --> 28:29.582
Hey. Excuse me.

28:29.666 --> 28:33.169
Yes, I'm sorry to bother you,
I really need to talk to my lawyer.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.671
So he drowned?

28:34.754 --> 28:36.798
No dipstick, the pool was empty.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.425
Wait, which guard was it again?

28:38.508 --> 28:43.054
I told you. The one that used
to work here. Big guy. Super tall.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.889
Right, right. Got it.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.436
Great. <i>Ebony.</i>

28:51.980 --> 28:54.607
Not you, Baby Killer. The other one.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.443
Please, I am so bored.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.779
I already read this one.
It's more character-driven than plotty,

28:59.863 --> 29:01.197
but it's intensely well observed.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.074
I appreciate the two-cent review,

29:03.158 --> 29:06.369
but listen, your buddy across the way
thought you might like to read it again.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.121
You hear me?

29:08.204 --> 29:09.539
What else did she say?

29:09.622 --> 29:12.459
Deitland, please, throw me a bone.
I'll take anything.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.335
Even the Bill O'Reilly book.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.382
-Red is trying to send a message.
-[Beth] Try page 69.

29:19.466 --> 29:22.260
They're always putting it there.
Think they're being so tricky.

29:22.343 --> 29:23.636
[sighs] Lame.

29:26.389 --> 29:28.725
Holy shit. You're right.

29:29.684 --> 29:35.940
"Tall one killed in pool."

29:39.068 --> 29:43.656
Tall... one?

29:43.740 --> 29:45.742
Does she mean Alex?

30:04.010 --> 30:09.098
Damn. I should've grabbed that Pantene
when I had the chance. Stupid.

30:09.182 --> 30:12.101
The stupid part is that
we have to steal it in the first place.

30:13.436 --> 30:15.939
Hey, hey, hey. One of Flaca's fangirls,

30:16.022 --> 30:18.942
she doesn't have
her shower caddie thing with her.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.401
[gasps]

30:22.278 --> 30:23.196
[exhales]

30:23.279 --> 30:25.990
Screw this. I'm goin' in.

30:26.074 --> 30:26.991
Yes!

30:27.075 --> 30:29.160
I'm going with you.
Not to brag or nothing,

30:29.244 --> 30:33.373
but I once walked outta Toys"R"Us
with 14 Bratz dolls in my pants.

30:33.456 --> 30:36.334
Oh, yeah.
Bootylicious, just stand lookout.

30:36.417 --> 30:40.255
Spewy McChunks,
you gotta make a distraction.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.590
Oh, no.
I don't think I have anything left.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.844
-So fake it.
-All right!

30:46.761 --> 30:50.056
-Yo, Daya, come closer.
-I'm not done cleaning this area.

30:50.139 --> 30:52.851
Well, my area is as ripe
as the stanky cheese...

30:53.601 --> 30:57.063
so all hands on deck! Come on.

30:59.107 --> 30:59.941
Oh!

31:00.024 --> 31:04.028
Oh, mercy me. Oh! When will it end?

31:04.821 --> 31:05.780
[mimics retching]

31:10.451 --> 31:13.496
-[coughing]
-There, there. You'll be okay.

31:15.874 --> 31:16.875
Uh-oh.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.334
Gotta go get that.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.260
Yay! [chuckles]

31:40.523 --> 31:42.525
You're sure Nicky got the message?

31:42.609 --> 31:47.530
Trust me. When it comes to this place,
I'm fucking hi-speed digital broadband.

31:47.614 --> 31:50.033
Overpriced with shitty customer service.

31:50.116 --> 31:52.702
I don't remember charging you anything.

31:52.785 --> 31:54.704
I know how people like you work.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.457
You'll come
to collect your debt eventually.

31:57.540 --> 32:00.793
Lighten up, Chucky. I'm on your team now.

32:00.877 --> 32:04.714
Here, I'll even send some good vibes
their way. [deep breath]

32:04.797 --> 32:07.717
-Don't waste your time.
-Beats doing nothing.

32:08.718 --> 32:12.096
'Specially if your crew gets in front
of those big, scary Feds

32:12.180 --> 32:15.350
and decides to serve you up
like Easter supper.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.686
I were you,
I'd get my butt in there, ASAP...

32:19.479 --> 32:21.064
turn on them first.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.109
You don't know my girls.

32:26.444 --> 32:29.447
I like to think
I'm a pretty good judge of character.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.825
But I guess we'll wait and see. [chuckles]

32:34.035 --> 32:38.247
They show up here again,
you know they got your back.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.961
But if they don't...

32:47.090 --> 32:50.468
Sorry, I've forgotten the question.

32:50.551 --> 32:55.348
You were explaining why your prints were
on the weapon that killed CO Piscatella.

32:55.431 --> 32:59.727
That's easy. Because I moved it.
I didn't want anyone getting hurt.

32:59.811 --> 33:03.147
You can't really be Annie Oakley
with the shakes.

33:04.482 --> 33:05.817
[Nguyen] <i>Nicky Nichols.</i>

33:05.900 --> 33:08.820
I wasn't told
you'd have representation present.

33:08.903 --> 33:12.782
Yeah. I was having trouble, uh,
pulling the trigger on my legal team.

33:13.741 --> 33:16.160
Not that I literally pulled any triggers.

33:17.370 --> 33:20.039
My client had nothing to do
with the violence in the riot,

33:20.123 --> 33:21.958
nor was she involved in organizing it.

33:22.041 --> 33:27.255
That's interesting. Because I have
testimony of over 30 inmates

33:27.338 --> 33:30.842
claiming they saw Ms. Nichols
break into the prison pharmacy

33:30.925 --> 33:34.929
and distribute thousands of dollars' worth
of prescription medications.

33:35.930 --> 33:39.183
Jesus.
It's like a George R.R. Martin novel.

33:39.267 --> 33:40.268
[scoffs]

33:40.351 --> 33:42.228
I'll need to review a copy of that.

33:42.311 --> 33:44.230
How is any of that even usable?

33:44.313 --> 33:46.941
Half of those girls
were high the whole time.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.694
I'd take this more seriously
if I were you, Ms. Nichols.

33:49.777 --> 33:52.905
If you add up the theft, possession,
and distribution charges

33:52.989 --> 33:54.532
the US Attorney's put together,

33:54.615 --> 33:56.701
you'll be facing an additional 70 years.

34:02.081 --> 34:03.207
[inmates gasping]

34:04.000 --> 34:06.836
[Black Cindy]<i> Shit! Burn, bitch. Burn.</i>

34:06.919 --> 34:08.212
[Taystee] <i>Fuck you, Piscatella.</i>

34:08.296 --> 34:10.048
[Black Cindy] <i>Yeah. What you got--</i>

34:10.798 --> 34:13.259
I'll tell you right now,
when a jury sees that, they're gonna think, riot organizer.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.598
I'd appreciate it if you'd stop
trying to intimidate my client

34:18.681 --> 34:20.058
with your scare tactics.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.393
Ms. Chapman had no involvement
in the riot's organization.

34:22.477 --> 34:23.853
If anything, she was its victim.

34:23.936 --> 34:28.399
A victim who quite willingly participated
in that bonfire

34:28.483 --> 34:30.276
and captured it all on video.

34:30.359 --> 34:33.905
But let's give Ms. Chapman a chance
to speak for herself, shall we?

34:33.988 --> 34:35.490
Ms. Chapman? Ms. Chapman?

34:38.159 --> 34:39.410
I'm sorry. What?

34:40.703 --> 34:43.956
I'd like you to detail exactly
how you participated in the riot.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.750
You want to know
what I did during the riot?

34:47.418 --> 34:51.464
I ran around collecting Cheetos
and organizing an art installation.

34:51.547 --> 34:54.217
[voice breaking]
That's what I chose to do...

34:57.053 --> 34:59.138
when I could have been with Alex...

35:01.182 --> 35:05.144
I couldn't see who fired the gun.
It was so dark.

35:05.228 --> 35:09.565
And-- And there was so much noise
and smoke and confusion--

35:09.649 --> 35:12.318
How about we look at some pictures?

35:12.401 --> 35:14.278
That might jog your memory.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.740
Well, they...

35:17.824 --> 35:19.575
They look familiar.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.327
But...

35:22.453 --> 35:24.956
But my mind's not what it used to be.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.543
What about her?

35:29.335 --> 35:30.711
You think it could have been her?

35:32.964 --> 35:35.883
I might be able to answer your question

35:35.967 --> 35:40.721
if we could have a little talk first
about my situation.

35:40.805 --> 35:41.764
[Les] <i>Give me a break.</i>

35:41.848 --> 35:44.642
We both know whatever AUSA
you're paired up with

35:44.725 --> 35:47.728
could give a rat's ass
about some bullshit drug charges.

35:47.812 --> 35:52.942
So, unless you have something real
you wanna discuss, Agent Nig-oo-yen,

35:53.025 --> 35:55.611
uh, I'd appreciate it if you didn't waste
any more of our time.

35:55.695 --> 35:56.946
It's pronounced "Noog-yen."

35:57.029 --> 35:57.947
Actually, it's "Wen."

35:58.614 --> 35:59.907
-"Wen"?
-Always.

36:00.616 --> 36:02.994
Apologies, Agent Nguyen.

36:03.077 --> 36:07.290
My colleague was merely suggesting
that you put a deal on the table.

36:07.373 --> 36:09.500
We both know that
the only thing you care about

36:09.584 --> 36:14.463
is identifying the leaders of the riot
and determining who killed CO Piscatella.

36:16.757 --> 36:19.302
I'll need to speak
to the US Attorney's Office first.

36:19.385 --> 36:21.512
Okay, so you're telling me

36:21.596 --> 36:25.516
you have no idea how CO Piscatella
came to be in that underground bunker?

36:25.600 --> 36:26.434
I...

36:27.518 --> 36:28.853
I guess Red...

36:29.729 --> 36:31.981
she made us bring him down there.

36:32.064 --> 36:34.233
-[Michelson] Galina Reznikov?
-Yes.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.611
I'm curious, Ms. Chapman.

36:36.694 --> 36:40.364
Why would a group of inmates
want a guard with them down in that pool?

36:40.448 --> 36:43.034
-Piper, you don't have to answer that.
-To torture him.

36:43.117 --> 36:46.037
She wanted to torture him
for torturing us.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.997
She couldn't let it go.

36:48.080 --> 36:52.084
Her fucking obsession
brought that crazy man into the prison

36:52.168 --> 36:55.046
and now Alex is...

36:57.506 --> 36:59.508
You know,
you should all go fuck yourselves.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.304
I don't care anymore.

37:03.387 --> 37:07.725
That is very helpful, Ms. Berlin.
I appreciate your cooperation.

37:07.808 --> 37:10.061
And I appreciate yours.

37:10.144 --> 37:13.481
I still have some questions
about that bunker pool,

37:13.564 --> 37:15.983
where CO Piscatella's body was found.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.777
Sit.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.574
They're going to make you a deal, Nicky.
All you have to do is give them a name.

37:25.409 --> 37:28.037
I don't know
who the fuck killed Piscatella.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.164
I mean, the last I saw the guy, he was...

37:30.790 --> 37:34.252
Okay, unfortunately, very much alive.

37:34.335 --> 37:37.046
Well, then maybe you can name
one of the organizers.

37:37.129 --> 37:40.508
Now, you mentioned the woman
on the phone, right?

37:40.591 --> 37:42.343
Who took you into the bunker.

37:42.426 --> 37:45.554
-[chuckles]
-She had a color instead of a name.

37:45.638 --> 37:49.100
Wait, first off, you named your kid
Atticus so you lost your right to judge.

37:49.183 --> 37:52.395
Second, Red is my friend.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.897
Based on what you told us
of her leadership role,

37:54.981 --> 37:57.942
the AUSA probably already has
a case against her.

37:58.025 --> 38:01.237
-Good for them. I'm not a snitch.
-Who cares?

38:01.320 --> 38:04.865
You're gonna give up the rest of your life
to protect some lousy criminal?

38:04.949 --> 38:08.119
[chuckles] Not that it matters,
but Red just happens to be

38:08.202 --> 38:11.580
one of the few people in my life
who actually cares about me.

38:11.664 --> 38:14.792
Kid, please,
I am begging you not to blow this.

38:14.875 --> 38:15.876
Oh, don't worry about that

38:15.960 --> 38:18.754
'cause I haven't blown anything
since at least 2006.

38:18.838 --> 38:21.966
Okay. Why don't you take the night
and sleep on it, Nicky?

38:22.049 --> 38:23.718
I know that this is a hard decision,

38:23.801 --> 38:27.179
but if you want any sort of a life
beyond these bars,

38:27.263 --> 38:29.140
then this may be your only chance.

38:29.223 --> 38:30.391
[sighs]

38:31.642 --> 38:33.519
[Bellamy] <i>Contraband peanut butter,</i>

38:33.602 --> 38:35.980
23 cans of Hormel baked beans,

38:36.063 --> 38:40.735
a 1994 Dell computer,
all of them covered in your fingerprints.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.988
Not to mention ample forensic evidence

38:44.071 --> 38:49.618
suggesting CO Piscatella was bound
in a bovine-themed stockade.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.370
[chuckles] We let him go.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.247
-Who's "we"?
-I let him go.

38:54.081 --> 38:56.042
Sounds to me like you held him hostage.

38:56.125 --> 38:58.044
After all,
he was tied up in your secret bunker.

38:58.127 --> 39:02.131
Crazy bastard stormed the place.
He was gonna kill all of us.

39:02.214 --> 39:04.717
So you decided to stop him
before he got the chance.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.844
-No.
-Oh, so you only tortured him.

39:06.927 --> 39:09.680
We immobilized him.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.891
No one did anything after that.

39:11.974 --> 39:14.602
He just sat there
with his head in the cow.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.939
I need another name, Ms. Berlin.

39:20.274 --> 39:22.651
That deal we talked about earlier,

39:22.735 --> 39:26.864
about keeping you in Ad Seg,
away from all those dangerous women--

39:26.947 --> 39:30.201
We did more than talk, we shook on it.

39:30.868 --> 39:34.914
And I gave you the black girl.
We had a deal.

39:34.997 --> 39:37.375
Well, things evolve.

39:37.958 --> 39:42.171
You wanna keep your private room,
you're gonna have to give me another name.

39:42.254 --> 39:43.589
Perhaps a Russian one.

39:45.841 --> 39:48.969
They've been gone for hours,
you'd think they'd be back by now.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.971
Jesus, Chucky, enough with the pacing.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.557
It's like you got a Fitbit
stashed up your snatch.

39:54.600 --> 39:57.978
-What's happening? Where is everyone?
-Don't know about that.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.398
You gotta come with me,
the investigators wanna talk to you.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.483
But I already spoke with them.

40:03.317 --> 40:07.113
See? What'd I tell ya,
you don't look out for number one,

40:07.196 --> 40:09.698
you wind up steppin' in number two.

40:14.537 --> 40:16.038
Move it along, ladies.

40:17.456 --> 40:18.457
Check it out.

40:18.541 --> 40:21.085
-Give me that conditioner.
-Chill, there's enough to go around.

40:37.518 --> 40:40.938
I know my nose has been
a little sensitive lately,

40:41.021 --> 40:43.566
but this shampoo,
it doesn't smell so good.

40:43.649 --> 40:44.525
Smell.

40:46.068 --> 40:49.280
-Ugh, that shit is nasty!
-Wait. You don't think that--

40:49.363 --> 40:50.322
Holy fuck!

-This ain't shampoo,

40:52.658 --> 40:53.993
it's sham-piss!

-Inmates, back in your cells, now.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.128
Wow, you girls must be pissed.

41:06.088 --> 41:09.425
Fuck off. This is your fault
for stealing our shit in the first place.

41:09.508 --> 41:10.551
[screams]

41:11.552 --> 41:13.095
You better watch your mouth, Diaz,

41:13.179 --> 41:16.474
or I'll put you in the SHU
for trying to incite another riot.

41:37.161 --> 41:40.915
I can put together a tight-ass

Tight-ass is a theme?

-Ah, she's funny, too.
-I ain't falling for no more pranks.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.672
That Pert-piss trick's for amateurs.

Mmm.

42:02.102 --> 42:03.729
Almost as good as you look.

42:06.732 --> 42:08.901
I put in a little something extra
to help with the pain.

Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

42:32.925 --> 42:36.428

about our shake-up over at corporate.

-Actually, it's fantastic.

42:41.433 --> 42:42.935
I was formerly head of purchasing,

but as of this morning,
I'm the new senior vice president.

42:46.480 --> 42:48.274

I was hoping to hit the ground running,
I'd love it

42:55.489 --> 42:58.367
if you and I could grab a drink this week
to go over some of my new ideas.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.745
Sounds wonderful.

43:12.131 --> 43:14.550
Let's go, inmate. It's moving day.

43:14.633 --> 43:16.051
No.

43:16.135 --> 43:17.428
Well, that can't be right.

43:17.511 --> 43:20.848

Let's do that again. Let's get another.

44:21.950 --> 44:24.078
Haven't seen her
since the bottom of the third.

44:24.161 --> 44:26.497
I saw her gettin' walked off by a CO,
I think.

44:27.164 --> 44:31.627
Damn it! This whole thing was her plan.
Plus, she fucked up our kicking order.

44:31.710 --> 44:33.253
Maybe she's in the bathroom.

44:33.337 --> 44:34.838
You're up, Carol!

Unless you want an automatic out
for delay of game.

Never could stand losing to me, could you?

45:34.732 --> 45:37.526
Always had to ruin a perfectly good game,
just like when we played Risk.

45:37.609 --> 45:40.070
That's because you always cheated!

-I'd fuckin' kill you twice.

and once for my Burt poster.
