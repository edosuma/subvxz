00:15.049 --> 00:16.277
Come in.

00:24.129 --> 00:25.562
Good morning.

00:26.289 --> 00:28.280
- Captain.
- Sleep well?

00:29.089 --> 00:30.158
Well enough.

00:30.289 --> 00:32.280
I wasn't sure
what you wanted for breakfast...

00:32.409 --> 00:36.687
so I took the liberty of having Chef
prepare his famous eggs Benedict.

00:37.449 --> 00:39.201
That'll be fine, sir.

00:41.089 --> 00:43.205
You plan to eat standing up?

00:52.089 --> 00:54.649
This isn't a visit
to the principal's office, Malcolm.

00:54.769 --> 00:55.963
At ease.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.362
Thank you, sir.

00:59.409 --> 01:03.322
I just wasn't sure if you called me here
to discuss something.

01:03.449 --> 01:05.120
No. No business.

01:05.649 --> 01:09.722
I wanted to have a long-overdue meal
with my Armoury Officer.

01:14.449 --> 01:18.158
I heard that England
made it to the finals in the World Cup.

01:18.849 --> 01:20.521
I beg your pardon?

01:21.209 --> 01:23.803
The World Cup. Soccer.

01:26.049 --> 01:28.961
I'm afraid I don't much follow football.

01:29.529 --> 01:32.089
Any sports you do follow?

01:33.089 --> 01:34.886
No. Not particularly.

01:39.129 --> 01:41.279
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, sir.

01:45.169 --> 01:47.729
I've been working on the duty roster, sir.

01:47.849 --> 01:50.602
We only have two crewmen
assigned to the Armoury full-time.

01:50.729 --> 01:52.367
If we added a third...

01:52.489 --> 01:55.526
Ensign Tanner would be free
to begin those upgrades...

01:55.649 --> 01:58.482
to those torpedo launchers
I told you about.

01:58.609 --> 02:02.727
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to bring your homework to the table?

02:02.849 --> 02:03.884
Sir?

02:09.089 --> 02:10.681
This looks fine.

02:16.609 --> 02:17.724
Archer.

02:17.849 --> 02:19.282
I'm sorry to interrupt, Captain...

02:19.409 --> 02:22.560
but we've detected an uncharted system
along our present course.

02:22.689 --> 02:24.919
One of the planets is Minshara-class.

02:25.049 --> 02:27.483
Take us out of Warp. I'm on my way.

02:32.609 --> 02:34.679
Looks like we'll have to reschedule.

02:34.809 --> 02:36.765
Whenever it's convenient.

02:41.169 --> 02:42.648
After you, sir.

02:54.649 --> 02:55.798
Anybody home?

02:55.929 --> 02:57.521
It's uninhabited.

02:57.649 --> 03:00.402
What about geographical features?
Anything interesting?

03:00.529 --> 03:03.407
There's a chain of volcanoes
that spans an entire hemisphere.

03:03.529 --> 03:06.805
I don't know about anyone else,
but I could use some fresh air.

03:06.929 --> 03:09.568
- Put us into standard orbit.
- Aye, sir.

03:10.049 --> 03:12.404
Find a volcano with a gentle slope.

03:12.529 --> 03:14.963
Preferably one that's not erupting.

03:15.409 --> 03:17.400
Prep a shuttlepod, Travis.

03:18.089 --> 03:20.239
We'll take shifts down to...

03:31.889 --> 03:34.483
It's been a long road

03:37.169 --> 03:39.205
Gettin' from there to here

03:39.329 --> 03:42.082
It's been a long time

03:42.929 --> 03:46.399
But my time is finally near

03:46.849 --> 03:50.285
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

03:51.049 --> 03:53.882
I will touch the sky

03:54.409 --> 03:57.958
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

03:58.089 --> 04:01.047
No, they're not gonna change my mind

04:01.169 --> 04:05.481
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

04:05.729 --> 04:08.687
I'm going where my heart will take me

04:08.809 --> 04:13.041
I've got faith to believe

04:13.289 --> 04:16.087
I can do anything

04:16.209 --> 04:19.963
I've got strength of the soul

04:20.569 --> 04:23.527
And no one's gonna bend or break me

04:23.649 --> 04:27.881
I can reach any star

04:29.049 --> 04:31.119
I've got faith

04:32.849 --> 04:36.046
I've got faith

04:36.569 --> 04:39.879
Faith of the heart

04:52.889 --> 04:54.083
Report.

04:54.209 --> 04:58.521
It was a thermo-kinetic explosion
on the outer hull, port forward quarter.

04:58.649 --> 05:00.719
Breaches on C-Deck, D-Deck.

05:02.849 --> 05:04.965
Bridge to Sick Bay.
We need medical assistance.

05:05.089 --> 05:06.807
- Acknowledged.
- Emergency bulkheads?

05:06.929 --> 05:09.602
They're in place, but eight subsections
have decompressed.

05:09.729 --> 05:12.880
- Was anybody in them?
- I can't tell, sir. Not yet.

05:13.089 --> 05:14.158
Find out what happened.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.843
Malcolm.

05:20.969 --> 05:22.721
I'd give you an answer if I could, sir.

05:22.849 --> 05:24.805
The sensor logs
aren't showing anything.

05:24.969 --> 05:27.881
- All systems were functioning normally.
- Archer to Engineering.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.597
Captain, what's going on?

05:29.729 --> 05:31.162
I was hoping you could tell me.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.757
We've got plasma fires,
an overload in the EPS grid...

05:33.889 --> 05:36.403
but what caused that explosion,
I don't have a clue.

05:36.529 --> 05:39.407
- Weapons fire, an asteroid?
- Nothing on our sensors.

05:39.529 --> 05:40.598
How are your people?

05:40.729 --> 05:42.640
A few bumps and bruises,
but we're all right.

05:42.769 --> 05:44.839
Keep me posted. Archer out.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.847
- Any casualty reports?
- Figures are coming in, sir.

05:47.969 --> 05:50.403
Seventeen so far, including Hoshi.

05:50.849 --> 05:52.282
No fatalities.

06:00.329 --> 06:02.968
Get this man into the lmaging Chamber.

06:06.569 --> 06:08.958
What's happening?
Are we under attack?

06:09.089 --> 06:10.920
- I don't know.
- Doctor.

06:12.009 --> 06:15.365
It needs to be addressed immediately,
before there's internal bleeding.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.968
Captain, something just struck the ship.

06:23.769 --> 06:26.727
Starboard side, upper-aft quadrant.

06:26.849 --> 06:28.601
Can you get a visual?

06:36.089 --> 06:37.204
There.

06:37.329 --> 06:39.604
Just behind the secondary plasma vent.
You see it?

06:42.689 --> 06:44.680
Some kind of cloaked ship?

06:45.049 --> 06:46.528
It's too small.

06:47.409 --> 06:49.639
I'm not reading any bio-signs.

06:53.529 --> 06:56.123
It's armed with tri-cobalt explosives.

06:56.289 --> 06:57.688
I think it's a mine.

06:57.809 --> 07:01.768
And judging by the firepower,
something similar damaged our ship.

07:02.169 --> 07:03.841
Can you tell if it's active?

07:03.969 --> 07:05.561
No reason to believe it's not.

07:05.689 --> 07:09.159
Captain, it's lodged
near lmpulse Reactor Two.

07:09.289 --> 07:12.759
An explosion anywhere near there
could disable Enterprise.

07:12.889 --> 07:15.164
What if we polarised
the adjacent hull plating?

07:15.289 --> 07:17.200
We don't know how it's triggered.

07:17.329 --> 07:19.160
Somebody has to go out there
and defuse it.

07:19.289 --> 07:22.440
And it should be me.
I have the ordnance training.

07:37.289 --> 07:40.599
I've never heard of a minefield
with just two mines.

07:41.129 --> 07:44.246
Are the quantum beacons still mounted
on the grappler arm?

07:44.369 --> 07:45.802
I believe so.

07:46.169 --> 07:48.046
Lower them into position.

07:48.169 --> 07:50.205
Then modify the viewscreen.

07:59.569 --> 08:00.524
Activate the beacon.

08:04.329 --> 08:06.923
They were designed to penetrate
Suliban cloaking devices.

08:08.409 --> 08:10.969
I'll try shifting the phase variance.

08:47.009 --> 08:50.797
Lieutenant Reed to the Bridge.
I've opened the outer hatch.

08:51.969 --> 08:53.402
Wish me luck.

09:04.769 --> 09:06.999
I'm detecting something
in the gamma spectrum.

09:07.129 --> 09:10.007
Phase variant, .0075.

09:38.489 --> 09:40.559
Its surface is pockmarked.

09:42.009 --> 09:44.284
Probably micrometeorite impacts.

09:45.049 --> 09:47.961
It seems to have been in orbit
for some time.

09:49.009 --> 09:50.920
The spikes are magnetic.

09:52.369 --> 09:55.008
Two of them have locked onto the hull.

09:55.209 --> 09:58.042
Stand by.
I'm going to run an internal scan.

10:04.209 --> 10:06.325
There are proximity sensors.

10:08.049 --> 10:09.482
But they appear to be off-line.

10:10.369 --> 10:13.918
It looks like the mine
doesn't think it's hit anything.

10:14.329 --> 10:16.923
I believe I've found an access panel.

10:17.369 --> 10:21.169
I'm going to try and remove it
and get a look inside.

10:22.809 --> 10:24.242
How bad is it?

10:24.449 --> 10:28.078
I can't really tell until we can get into
the decompressed sections...

10:28.209 --> 10:30.439
but I imagine it's pretty ugly.

10:30.849 --> 10:33.158
I've got one piece of good news.

10:33.569 --> 10:35.924
I did a head count.
We didn't lose anyone.

10:39.009 --> 10:42.843
Trip, I'm not sure Malcolm's
gonna be able to defuse this thing.

10:42.969 --> 10:47.326
Couldn't we just detach that section
of hull plating? Let it drift away?

10:48.129 --> 10:50.802
We'd have to reroute
some EPS conduits.

10:50.929 --> 10:53.284
There's about 300 bolt couplings.

10:54.129 --> 10:55.244
It could be done.

10:55.369 --> 10:56.643
How long?

10:56.889 --> 10:58.607
Three or four hours.

10:58.849 --> 11:00.362
But I wouldn't recommend it, sir.

11:00.489 --> 11:03.287
We'd be exposing a good piece
of the impulse manifold.

11:03.409 --> 11:05.081
Get a team started.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.519
I'll consider it our last resort.

11:11.529 --> 11:13.406
I'm removing the panel.

11:15.409 --> 11:17.764
The arming mechanism's extending.

11:23.409 --> 11:24.637
Captain.

11:25.369 --> 11:27.041
We see it, Malcolm.

11:35.449 --> 11:38.407
- Ever see a ship like that?
- No.

11:38.649 --> 11:40.241
It's deflecting our scans.

11:40.369 --> 11:42.724
Why didn't the beacons let us see
through its cloak?

11:42.849 --> 11:46.285
Perhaps the mines use
a more primitive cloaking system.

11:46.609 --> 11:48.964
Sir, they're hailing us.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.124
The translator's not locking on.

12:11.649 --> 12:12.877
Archer to Sick Bay.

12:14.729 --> 12:15.718
Yes, Captain.

12:15.849 --> 12:18.841
Is Hoshi in any shape
to return to the Bridge? It's urgent.

12:18.969 --> 12:20.118
I'm afraid not.

12:20.249 --> 12:22.319
She suffered
a rather severe concussion.

12:22.449 --> 12:23.564
Understood.

12:23.689 --> 12:25.600
Tell them I'm on my way.

12:26.089 --> 12:29.718
You'd be of little help
in your present condition, Ensign.

12:34.889 --> 12:37.005
- Any luck?
- Not yet.

12:38.849 --> 12:40.805
They're charging weapons.

12:44.129 --> 12:47.041
They missed our starboard nacelle
by less than 20 metres.

12:47.169 --> 12:49.444
Not a very subtle warning shot.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.528
Can you get us out of here?

12:57.649 --> 13:00.004
The orbits of those mines
are pretty erratic, sir.

13:00.129 --> 13:03.599
- It's going to be tricky.
- We'll give you whatever help we can.

13:04.129 --> 13:06.597
- Bridge to Lieutenant Reed.
- Go ahead.

13:06.729 --> 13:09.687
Our friends seem to be anxious
for us to leave.

13:09.969 --> 13:12.119
We're going to break orbit,
nice and slowly.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.602
Understood.

13:14.009 --> 13:17.319
If you plan to go to warp, sir,
you'll let me know?

13:17.569 --> 13:19.321
I'll try to remember.

13:19.449 --> 13:22.088
- Manoeuvring thrusters only.
- Aye, sir.

13:25.729 --> 13:27.447
Activate the beacon.

13:45.089 --> 13:46.966
Our friends just vanished.

13:47.089 --> 13:49.842
That doesn't mean
they're not still close.

14:03.489 --> 14:05.207
Lieutenant Reed to Bridge.

14:05.889 --> 14:07.083
Go ahead.

14:07.209 --> 14:10.406
I've identified
four separate detonation circuits.

14:11.889 --> 14:14.881
If I can isolate them
in the proper sequence...

14:15.369 --> 14:18.122
I should be able to deactivate the mine.

14:18.729 --> 14:20.526
It'll take some doing.

14:20.649 --> 14:24.437
But to be honest, Captain,
it's only a theory.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.361
How good a theory?

14:26.689 --> 14:29.726
The closest thing I'm familiar with
that this device resembles...

14:29.849 --> 14:32.238
is a Triton-class spatial torpedo.

14:32.369 --> 14:35.281
I've disarmed
at least half a dozen of those.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.527
I believe I can do it, sir.

14:37.649 --> 14:40.322
I've got Trip working on a backup plan.

14:41.169 --> 14:43.285
But I'd prefer not to use it.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.324
Right now, you're our best bet.

14:48.129 --> 14:49.801
Be careful, Malcolm.

14:54.609 --> 14:55.883
I see it.

15:10.129 --> 15:11.323
Bridge.

15:11.769 --> 15:12.804
Go ahead.

15:12.929 --> 15:15.159
Another one of those spikes
I told you about.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.483
What about it?

15:16.609 --> 15:19.203
It just magnetised itself to the hull.

15:19.689 --> 15:21.168
Is there a problem?

15:21.289 --> 15:22.722
On its way...

15:23.729 --> 15:25.765
it went through my leg, sir.

15:25.889 --> 15:28.244
I'm on my way, Lieutenant.
The Bridge is yours.

15:28.369 --> 15:31.964
Captain, I should be the one
to go out there. I'm the engineer.

15:32.089 --> 15:34.398
That's why I need you here, Trip.

15:35.409 --> 15:38.719
You'll have to wait in line for
my osmotic eel to cauterise your wound.

15:38.849 --> 15:41.204
- He's getting quite a workout today.
- Doctor.

15:41.329 --> 15:43.240
- Ensign.
- They need a translator.

15:43.369 --> 15:46.088
- I should be at my post.
- I realise you're anxious to help.

15:46.209 --> 15:48.439
But you wouldn't make it to the turbolift.

15:48.569 --> 15:51.720
If you'd like, I could have them
bring the com-logs here.

15:51.849 --> 15:53.487
Thank you, Doctor.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.284
Thought you might need a hand.

15:59.729 --> 16:03.005
Actually, I'd prefer a leg.

16:05.849 --> 16:09.000
Let's see what we can do
with the one you've got.

16:16.889 --> 16:19.562
Could have been worse.
It missed the bone.

16:19.689 --> 16:21.805
And it looks like
the pressure from the spike...

16:21.929 --> 16:23.965
is keeping the wound
from bleeding too much.

16:24.089 --> 16:26.319
You'll be in Sick Bay in no time.

16:26.449 --> 16:28.838
These should cut right through it.

16:29.049 --> 16:31.404
Actually, sir, I wouldn't do that.

16:32.369 --> 16:35.998
My scanner showed detonation circuits
inside the spikes.

16:36.649 --> 16:39.686
I would consider letting you amputate.

16:40.169 --> 16:44.560
But if Chef got hold of it, he'd be serving
roast Reed for Sunday dinner.

16:45.649 --> 16:47.765
Just give me something for the pain...

16:47.889 --> 16:50.483
and I'll do my best
to reach the access panel.

16:50.609 --> 16:53.248
Not without doing more damage
to that leg.

16:53.369 --> 16:58.045
What's more important,
my leg or your ship?

16:59.049 --> 17:00.880
I intend to save both.

17:01.089 --> 17:02.681
I don't see how.

17:03.049 --> 17:05.768
That backup plan
I was telling you about?

17:06.089 --> 17:09.968
I asked Trip to prepare
to detach this section of hull plating.

17:10.769 --> 17:12.839
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

17:12.969 --> 17:14.880
It's still a good idea.

17:15.249 --> 17:17.365
Not with you attached to it.

17:18.089 --> 17:20.204
I hope that's an anaesthetic.

17:20.329 --> 17:22.001
Phlox's own recipe.

17:28.849 --> 17:32.285
Please, sir, may I have some more?

17:32.689 --> 17:34.839
I don't want you too sedated.

17:35.409 --> 17:37.365
I'm gonna need your help.

17:38.089 --> 17:40.762
Someone's got to defuse this thing.

17:41.449 --> 17:43.565
You're gonna talk me through it.

17:43.689 --> 17:45.964
With all due respect, Captain...

17:46.249 --> 17:49.764
disarming mines
is extremely delicate business.

17:50.369 --> 17:52.087
I'm trained for it.

17:52.889 --> 17:54.288
You're not.

17:55.689 --> 17:57.361
I'm a quick study.

17:58.489 --> 18:00.605
It's too dangerous.

18:02.569 --> 18:04.685
In case you haven't noticed,
Lieutenant...

18:04.809 --> 18:08.279
we're sitting about five metres
from an impulse reactor.

18:10.249 --> 18:12.843
I'm not leaving
till we take this weapon off-line.

18:12.969 --> 18:14.004
Sir...

18:14.129 --> 18:17.599
The way I see it,
you don't have much choice.

18:18.249 --> 18:19.477
You're sort of stuck here.

18:20.649 --> 18:23.004
So would you let me get started?

18:27.009 --> 18:29.318
I hope you've got a steady hand.

18:45.169 --> 18:47.842
They're ordering us
to leave their system immediately...

18:47.969 --> 18:50.802
- or they'll destroy us.
- Charming.

18:50.929 --> 18:53.443
Could you figure out a way
to compose a message back...

18:53.569 --> 18:55.685
explaining we're going
as fast as we can?

18:55.809 --> 18:57.083
I can try.

18:59.089 --> 19:01.045
And their next message?

19:01.169 --> 19:04.878
They say they've annexed this planet
in the name of something called...

19:05.009 --> 19:06.647
"The Romalin Star Empire."

19:07.889 --> 19:11.802
Romulan. It's pronounced "Romulan."

19:20.089 --> 19:21.317
Romulans?

19:21.889 --> 19:23.880
I read about them
when I was with Daniels.

19:24.009 --> 19:25.965
- What'd you find out?
- Not much.

19:26.089 --> 19:28.603
Just the name.
He wouldn't let me see anything else.

19:28.729 --> 19:29.718
T'Pol?

19:29.849 --> 19:32.522
They're rumoured to be
an aggressive territorial species...

19:32.649 --> 19:36.119
but the Vulcan High Command has
never made direct contact with them.

19:36.249 --> 19:38.444
Ensign Sato's translation says...

19:38.569 --> 19:41.766
they're demanding we withdraw
from the system immediately.

19:41.969 --> 19:44.529
That's going to be a little tough to do
at the moment.

19:44.729 --> 19:47.163
Is there any way
you can explain our situation?

19:47.289 --> 19:50.918
She believes she'll have a reply
prepared within the hour.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.726
How's it going out there, Captain?

19:53.849 --> 19:56.317
We've taken two
of the detonation circuits off-line.

19:56.449 --> 19:59.486
Three more to go. Keep me posted.

20:02.089 --> 20:03.761
The next one's going to be tricky.

20:03.889 --> 20:07.518
Do you see the Y-shaped components
surrounding the circuit?

20:11.849 --> 20:13.840
- There are six of them.
- Right.

20:13.969 --> 20:16.244
Those are timing relays.

20:16.729 --> 20:21.086
You'll have to rotate each one
counterclockwise 70 degrees.

20:22.169 --> 20:24.967
But it has to be done
in the proper order.

20:25.169 --> 20:27.046
I'll guide you through it.

20:27.169 --> 20:30.206
Start with the relay to your upper right.

20:30.849 --> 20:32.487
One centimetre...

20:32.609 --> 20:35.965
and then turn it 70 degrees...

20:36.089 --> 20:37.807
counterclockwise.

20:41.889 --> 20:43.004
Good.

20:44.129 --> 20:46.438
Now pull it out, slowly.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.081
Be careful not to touch the housing.

20:58.929 --> 21:03.878
Well done. Now complete that set,
on the diagonal.

21:06.489 --> 21:09.481
- So where were we?
- Sir?

21:09.609 --> 21:13.045
This morning, at breakfast,
before we were interrupted.

21:13.569 --> 21:14.922
You said...

21:15.689 --> 21:18.328
you didn't follow any particular sport.

21:19.049 --> 21:22.962
I'm afraid I haven't started following one
since breakfast, sir.

21:25.249 --> 21:28.207
Now go to the relay top centre.

21:29.729 --> 21:32.607
Watch that one.
I believe it may be damaged.

21:33.609 --> 21:36.567
It'll need some extra torque
to deactivate it.

21:39.089 --> 21:40.966
How about hobbies?

21:41.089 --> 21:43.967
- Any hobbies?
- No. Not really, sir.

21:44.209 --> 21:47.519
I could have sworn I've seen you
reading a book or two in the mess hall.

21:47.649 --> 21:52.120
Sir, do you really think that this is
the appropriate time for a chat?

21:52.969 --> 21:56.166
It helps me focus. Calms my nerves.

21:56.289 --> 21:58.200
It isn't calming mine.

21:58.329 --> 22:02.686
Sorry. It made you a little nervous
this morning, too, didn't it?

22:03.209 --> 22:04.642
Why is that?

22:05.329 --> 22:10.039
If you must know, I was honoured
to be asked to sit at your table.

22:10.969 --> 22:15.440
I just wasn't entirely comfortable
having a casual meal with my captain.

22:16.409 --> 22:19.845
I was trained not to fraternise
with superior officers.

22:21.089 --> 22:23.000
Never too late to learn.

22:23.449 --> 22:25.326
Frankly, sir, from my point of view...

22:25.529 --> 22:28.919
that kind of socialising has no place
on a starship.

22:29.209 --> 22:32.485
I had a CO once, felt the same way.

22:33.169 --> 22:35.842
"They're your crew, not your friends."

22:37.209 --> 22:40.997
I thought about that a lot
when I took this command.

22:42.609 --> 22:45.646
But then I realised
this is not your typical mission.

22:45.769 --> 22:48.158
We could be out here for years.

22:48.289 --> 22:52.248
All we have to depend on is each other.

22:57.969 --> 23:01.598
There are two left. Top left first.

23:02.769 --> 23:06.205
I appreciate your suggestions, Malcolm.

23:07.129 --> 23:08.608
Anything else?

23:11.009 --> 23:15.560
Since you asked, Bridge protocols
have become somewhat lax.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.203
Too many people offering opinions.

23:18.609 --> 23:20.964
We're here to carry out your orders, sir.

23:21.489 --> 23:22.922
You're the Captain.

23:23.049 --> 23:24.880
What's the point
of having a senior staff...

23:25.009 --> 23:27.603
if they just sit around
with their mouths shut?

23:27.729 --> 23:31.517
I'm glad they have opinions.
I rely on them.

23:36.769 --> 23:38.168
Keep going.

23:39.369 --> 23:41.883
And in the area of security...

23:42.009 --> 23:45.843
I sometimes think you could show
a little more caution, sir.

23:46.049 --> 23:48.244
I'm aware of your concerns in that area.

23:49.529 --> 23:52.680
Not to say it hasn't been a privilege
to have served with you.

23:54.489 --> 23:55.524
Sir?

23:55.649 --> 23:57.799
You're talking in the past tense,
Lieutenant.

24:05.609 --> 24:09.284
Now reinsert all six relays...

24:10.089 --> 24:12.125
but in the reverse order.

24:20.569 --> 24:24.323
- You're doing fine, sir.
- Thanks.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.600
You've earned yourself a break, Travis.

24:39.729 --> 24:42.527
Ensign Hutchison can cover the helm
for a while.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.846
Thank you, sir,
but I'd prefer to stay at my post.

24:46.569 --> 24:48.366
Bridge to Captain Archer.

24:48.489 --> 24:49.763
Go ahead.

24:49.889 --> 24:51.527
We're clear of the minefield.

24:52.609 --> 24:55.487
- Maintain course and speed.
- Understood.

24:58.809 --> 25:03.325
This last detonation circuit
has an added attraction.

25:04.729 --> 25:08.244
I'm seeing something that looks
like a backup arming mechanism.

25:10.009 --> 25:13.081
We'll have to fool the circuit
into thinking it's still on-line.

25:14.129 --> 25:15.528
How do we do that?

25:15.649 --> 25:19.039
There's a hyperspanner
in the equipment case.

25:19.329 --> 25:22.605
Take out its power cell
and strip off the casing.

25:24.129 --> 25:28.759
You must've realised this wasn't going
to be your typical armoury posting.

25:29.289 --> 25:32.201
That my command style lacked...

25:32.329 --> 25:35.321
a certain spit and polish.

25:36.169 --> 25:39.923
It was obvious,
if you don't mind my saying so.

25:41.489 --> 25:44.561
- Strange.
- What's strange, sir?

25:44.689 --> 25:49.001
I understand you came
from a long line of Royal Navy men.

25:49.129 --> 25:51.723
Your father, your grandfather.

25:51.849 --> 25:56.365
Why pick Starfleet?
Why not continue the family tradition?

25:56.929 --> 25:59.887
- God knows I tried.
- What happened?

26:01.049 --> 26:03.040
I'll need a circuit probe.

26:23.369 --> 26:28.124
- So what happened?
- I was raised on the water.

26:28.969 --> 26:32.598
I knew how to handle a boat
before I could ride a bicycle.

26:34.169 --> 26:36.637
Studied all the great naval battles.

26:38.009 --> 26:42.366
I don't know, I suppose I thought
I'd just grow out of it.

26:42.689 --> 26:44.281
Grow out of what?

26:46.089 --> 26:47.442
Aquaphobia.

26:49.529 --> 26:51.201
You're afraid of the water?

26:51.569 --> 26:54.925
More precisely, afraid of drowning.

26:57.969 --> 27:00.608
So instead of a life on the sea...

27:00.729 --> 27:04.324
you chose a life
in the vacuum of space?

27:15.649 --> 27:19.198
I had a great-uncle
who suffered from the same problem.

27:21.489 --> 27:23.445
But he faced his fears...

27:24.129 --> 27:27.405
joined the Navy,
had a distinguished career.

27:28.889 --> 27:31.278
All you have to do...

27:31.689 --> 27:35.841
is attach it to the cylinder
on your upper right.

27:41.249 --> 27:44.924
It's working.
Start with the top-most component.

27:45.449 --> 27:48.521
Use the calliper
to lift it a few millimetres...

27:48.649 --> 27:52.562
and then turn it clockwise
360 degrees...

27:52.689 --> 27:54.884
and then gently re-insert it.

27:57.529 --> 28:01.408
He was something of a hero to me,
my great-uncle.

28:02.529 --> 28:05.362
- The one with aquaphobia?
- Indeed.

28:05.489 --> 28:08.322
He signed up
with the submarine service.

28:08.449 --> 28:11.122
Talk about facing your deepest fears.

28:12.249 --> 28:13.921
He was a brave man.

28:15.609 --> 28:19.158
Wasn't long before he'd worked
his way up through the ranks...

28:19.289 --> 28:22.361
made Chief Engineer
on the H.M.S. Clement.

28:23.449 --> 28:25.519
Do you know
the story of the Clement, sir?

28:25.649 --> 28:29.085
I don't think I do.

28:30.329 --> 28:31.478
Good.

28:31.609 --> 28:34.840
Now the other five components.

28:36.449 --> 28:41.045
Repeat the same process on each one,
counterclockwise.

28:43.129 --> 28:45.723
You were telling me about the Clement.

28:46.689 --> 28:48.964
They were on a routine patrol...

28:49.409 --> 28:51.445
when they had an accident.

28:53.449 --> 28:56.282
Now there's a beautiful irony for you.

28:57.009 --> 29:01.002
They hit a mine
left over from some world war.

29:03.009 --> 29:06.399
There they were, trapped,
underneath an ice shelf...

29:07.849 --> 29:11.603
several compartments flooding,
including Engineering.

29:13.529 --> 29:15.167
Can you imagine?

29:15.889 --> 29:17.527
My great-uncle...

29:18.409 --> 29:20.445
the man afraid of drowning?

29:21.369 --> 29:24.805
The ship was sinking, losing power.

29:26.249 --> 29:28.717
According to his lieutenant...

29:28.929 --> 29:32.205
my great-uncle sealed himself
in the engine room...

29:32.929 --> 29:36.001
and kept the reactor on-line
long enough...

29:36.169 --> 29:38.967
for his crew to make it
to the escape pods.

29:41.969 --> 29:44.005
He went down with the ship.

29:45.369 --> 29:48.361
He did what he had to do
to save his crewmates.

29:49.449 --> 29:52.885
I appreciate
what you're trying to tell me, Malcolm...

29:53.569 --> 29:55.241
but I was hoping...

29:57.609 --> 30:00.885
you'd be able to save your heroics
for another time.

30:01.329 --> 30:04.639
I just want you to know, sir,
that I am prepared.

30:05.649 --> 30:06.638
Got you.

30:07.649 --> 30:11.119
If we're not able to defuse this mine,
the safety of the crew...

30:11.249 --> 30:13.479
I said I heard you, Lieutenant.

30:22.409 --> 30:24.639
I'm afraid we have another problem, sir.

30:24.769 --> 30:27.237
What? What is it?

30:28.889 --> 30:30.925
I need to use the bathroom.

30:33.689 --> 30:35.486
I won't tell a soul.

30:36.409 --> 30:38.161
In my EV suit, sir?

30:50.849 --> 30:51.884
Sir.

30:57.889 --> 30:59.561
We're being hailed.

31:02.409 --> 31:04.604
You've ignored our warnings.

31:05.409 --> 31:08.719
We were unable to translate
your language until a short time ago.

31:08.969 --> 31:11.563
We're trying to defuse a weapon lodged
on our hull.

31:11.689 --> 31:13.805
I'm well aware of your situation.

31:13.929 --> 31:14.964
Our scans show...

31:15.089 --> 31:18.240
you're prepared to detach
the hull segment surrounding the mine.

31:18.369 --> 31:22.521
Complete the procedure
and leave this system immediately.

31:23.169 --> 31:25.524
We've got a man trapped out there.

31:25.649 --> 31:27.287
Don't your scans show you that?

31:27.409 --> 31:31.322
One crewman.
You have 82 others safely aboard.

31:31.569 --> 31:34.129
Jettison the hull segment and leave.

31:34.249 --> 31:37.082
We will not tolerate espionage.

31:39.169 --> 31:40.602
T'Pol, report.

31:44.049 --> 31:47.883
They're demanding we jettison
the section of hull plating and leave.

31:48.009 --> 31:49.567
They scanned us, Captain.

31:49.689 --> 31:51.361
They know we're ready to detach it.

31:51.489 --> 31:54.242
I'm defusing the last detonation circuit.

31:56.089 --> 31:57.363
Stand by.

32:20.529 --> 32:24.886
It's rearming!
Reset that last component! Quickly!

32:40.169 --> 32:41.318
Lieutenant?

32:41.449 --> 32:44.282
When you deactivated that final circuit...

32:45.409 --> 32:47.559
it triggered a subdetonator.

32:47.969 --> 32:51.120
- How can we get to it?
- We can't.

32:51.769 --> 32:53.885
It's too deep inside.

32:54.169 --> 32:56.842
We'd have to dismantle the entire mine.

32:58.529 --> 32:59.803
Captain...

33:01.009 --> 33:03.284
those heroics we spoke about...

33:05.809 --> 33:07.686
I think it may be time.

33:17.009 --> 33:19.204
You've done all you can, sir.

33:20.169 --> 33:23.923
For what it's worth,
you'd make a fine Armoury Officer.

33:24.049 --> 33:25.482
Show me that subdetonator.

33:25.609 --> 33:29.284
I'd prefer a burial at sea,
if I'm not completely vaporised.

33:29.409 --> 33:31.525
I thought you were afraid of the water.

33:31.649 --> 33:35.005
- Your scanner, Lieutenant.
- I told you, sir.

33:35.449 --> 33:37.679
There's nothing we can do.

33:37.809 --> 33:40.960
We'll dismantle this thing
piece by piece if we have to.

33:41.089 --> 33:43.887
- That'll take days.
- My schedule's open.

33:44.009 --> 33:45.727
And these Romulans?

33:45.849 --> 33:48.124
They don't seem like the patient types.

33:48.249 --> 33:52.401
The longer we stay in this system,
the more likely they're going to attack.

33:52.529 --> 33:55.202
As much as I appreciate
all your efforts...

33:55.329 --> 33:57.797
you have to detach the hull plating.

33:58.129 --> 34:01.758
- It's the only option.
- I'm not leaving one of my crew behind.

34:01.889 --> 34:05.677
- You're putting Enterprise at risk.
- We're wasting time.

34:06.449 --> 34:10.442
Help me figure out a way to get you off
of here. That's an order.

34:17.688 --> 34:19.804
What the hell are you doing?

34:39.969 --> 34:41.083
Great.

34:54.208 --> 34:56.643
If I were the kind of captain
you think I should be...

34:56.768 --> 34:58.600
I'd bust your ass back to crewman.

34:58.729 --> 35:00.799
Begging your pardon, sir...

35:00.929 --> 35:02.806
but if you were that kind of captain...

35:02.929 --> 35:05.238
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

35:05.369 --> 35:06.961
You'd have cut me loose by now.

35:07.489 --> 35:09.923
I'm not going to do that, Malcolm.

35:13.929 --> 35:18.081
When we triggered that subdetonator,
why didn't the mine explode right away?

35:18.969 --> 35:21.119
How many seconds went by
before I rearmed it?

35:21.249 --> 35:23.843
- Sir?
- How many seconds?

35:23.969 --> 35:27.803
I don't remember. Ten, maybe 12.

35:27.929 --> 35:32.081
- It felt more like 20.
- Ten, 20, what's the difference?

35:32.569 --> 35:34.321
If it had exploded...

35:35.809 --> 35:38.243
how big would the yield have been?

35:39.489 --> 35:42.287
Judging by the damage
the first mine caused...

35:42.409 --> 35:45.082
I'd guess about a quarter of a kiloton.

35:45.209 --> 35:47.359
What are you getting at, sir?

35:52.369 --> 35:54.041
How close is your team to finishing?

35:54.169 --> 35:57.286
They're down to the last few couplings.
What's going on out there?

35:57.409 --> 35:59.798
We're going to detach the plating.

36:01.529 --> 36:05.204
- You did everything you could, Captain.
- I'm going with him.

36:05.329 --> 36:08.048
Could a shuttlepod hatch withstand
a quarter kiloton blast?

36:08.169 --> 36:11.445
- Depends how close it was.
- Twenty metres, maybe 25.

36:11.929 --> 36:13.840
They're reinforced
with duratanium alloy.

36:13.969 --> 36:16.961
They can take a hell of a beating.
What have you got in mind?

36:17.089 --> 36:18.920
I need two shuttlepod hatches.

36:19.049 --> 36:20.767
Have them brought up here
on the double.

36:20.889 --> 36:22.607
- Sir?
- On the double.

36:26.569 --> 36:30.482
Captain, I assume there's no point
in my questioning your plan.

36:47.009 --> 36:48.681
Bridge to Captain Archer.

36:48.809 --> 36:50.527
- Go ahead.
- We're ready.

36:52.209 --> 36:53.688
See you soon.

36:54.729 --> 36:56.287
Hang on, fellows.

37:33.329 --> 37:36.685
- Six hundred metres.
- Another 100 ought to do it.

37:38.649 --> 37:40.082
Sub-Commander.

37:42.009 --> 37:43.283
Hail them.

37:45.289 --> 37:46.642
No response.

37:49.329 --> 37:50.728
They're charging weapons.

37:50.849 --> 37:52.282
Polarise the hull plating.

37:52.409 --> 37:55.207
I'll do what I can, but keep in mind
we're missing some of it.

37:59.489 --> 38:00.968
It's rearming!

38:05.409 --> 38:07.127
That's it. Let's go.

38:24.289 --> 38:25.688
Now, Malcolm.

38:36.329 --> 38:38.365
Enterprise to Captain Archer.

38:42.689 --> 38:44.327
Captain, respond.

38:47.569 --> 38:50.879
Maybe their transmitters
were knocked out in the blast.

38:53.409 --> 38:57.004
I see them.
Bearing two-one-three, mark four.

38:57.129 --> 38:58.482
Closing in.

38:58.809 --> 39:01.118
Open the doors to Launch Bay 2.

39:01.249 --> 39:03.046
The Romulans are locking weapons!

39:03.169 --> 39:05.399
- Bridge to Dr. Phlox.
- Go ahead.

39:05.529 --> 39:07.485
Meet us outside Launch Bay 2.

39:07.609 --> 39:09.167
They're targeting our engines.

39:09.289 --> 39:13.043
A hundred metres more. Fifty.

39:14.409 --> 39:16.604
I've got them.
Sealing Launch Bay doors.

39:16.729 --> 39:18.401
Go to warp, Ensign.

39:36.209 --> 39:37.642
You all right?

39:38.129 --> 39:40.165
All things considered.

39:40.969 --> 39:42.800
If I may say so, sir...

39:42.929 --> 39:46.126
your style of command
does have its advantages.

39:47.849 --> 39:49.999
So how long was it?

39:52.369 --> 39:54.121
I counted 10 seconds.

39:54.249 --> 39:57.047
Ten? It was more like 20.

39:57.689 --> 40:00.601
Respectfully, sir, it was 10.

40:01.649 --> 40:04.368
I'm not going to argue with you.

40:04.489 --> 40:07.162
It was 20. That's an order.
