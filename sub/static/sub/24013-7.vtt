00:54.804 --> 00:57.140
So we worked on it for hours and hours.

00:57.223 --> 01:01.102
Once it was finished,
it just screamed "Poppy."

01:01.186 --> 01:02.645
I love it!

01:02.729 --> 01:04.813
Sleeveless and such vibrant purple.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.525
- How did you come up with this?
- Uh...

01:07.609 --> 01:09.069
I think red!

01:09.152 --> 01:11.571
No, it should be blue!

01:16.785 --> 01:18.411
Oh...

01:18.495 --> 01:20.205
Something's wrong with your side!

01:20.288 --> 01:22.165
No, something's wrong with your side!

01:25.126 --> 01:26.628
Oh...

01:27.670 --> 01:29.923
The process was brutal.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.758
It always is.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.511
Well, whatever it is,
you always make great clothes,

01:34.594 --> 01:37.180
which is why I asked a friend
to pay you a visit.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.681
You may have heard of her.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.058
Nova Swift?

01:40.141 --> 01:41.392
Gasp.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.102
Nova Swift?

01:43.186 --> 01:47.315
She's Troll Village's
most influential tastemaker.

01:48.441 --> 01:51.111
With one word,
she can make a trend...

01:51.194 --> 01:52.362
This is so...

01:53.488 --> 01:54.489
...sizzle.

01:54.572 --> 01:55.782
Yeah!

01:55.865 --> 01:57.742
Or break a trend.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.537
On second thought, nah.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.003
I can't wait to meet her!

02:10.088 --> 02:11.840
She's so effortlessly chic!

02:11.923 --> 02:14.092
And has such a flair for the dramatic!

02:15.510 --> 02:16.761
Do I?

02:16.845 --> 02:18.805
Shudder. Nova Swift!

02:18.888 --> 02:20.515
It's such an honor!

02:20.598 --> 02:23.518
The honor is mine, my little nuggets.

02:23.601 --> 02:27.689
When Queen Poppy told me
about the ferocious garms you two make,

02:27.772 --> 02:29.816
I just had to feast my eyes.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.652
Do we make ferocious garms?

02:32.735 --> 02:35.530
She means our clothes. Keep up.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.657
-She means clothes, right?
-Mm-mm-mm.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.492
I heart this.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.162
Oh, and I brain this!

02:42.245 --> 02:44.122
And this fur...

02:44.205 --> 02:45.748
feels so real!

02:45.832 --> 02:47.375
Ooh!

02:47.458 --> 02:48.960
It really does.

02:49.043 --> 02:51.754
Cooper, stop napping in our clothes.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.632
But it's comfy!

02:57.176 --> 03:01.806
Well, nuggets, I'd like to say
your designs scream "sizzle."

03:01.890 --> 03:03.349
- Joy!
- But I can't.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.309
Death.

03:04.392 --> 03:08.396
Because a design only really comes alive
when it's worn.

03:08.479 --> 03:13.026
Oh... if only there was a way to fix that.

03:14.068 --> 03:17.030
Are you saying you want us
to put on a fashion show?

03:17.113 --> 03:21.618
Agreed! Tonight, eight o'clock,
not a second later, or I'm yesterday!

03:23.995 --> 03:26.080
Oh, one last thing. Who's your model?

03:26.164 --> 03:27.498
Hmm? Hmm.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.500
Okay, I can do it.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.502
Oh, no, my nugget.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.795
Wait. Why not?

03:32.879 --> 03:34.339
You don't think I've got "it"?

03:34.422 --> 03:36.925
No.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.552
You've got too much "it."

03:39.636 --> 03:41.429
Your sizzle is so en fuego,

03:41.512 --> 03:43.765
you'd steal the spotlight
from the clothes.

03:43.848 --> 03:47.477
Aw. Well, my sizzle is pretty en fuego.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.519
Seriously.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.856
The wrong model can turn chic clothes
into weak clothes,

03:51.940 --> 03:53.858
so choose wisely.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.821
Live wild, my little nuggets!

04:00.865 --> 04:02.242
I'd say that went well.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.952
"Well"? Are you kidding us?

04:04.035 --> 04:04.994
Yeah, Poppy.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.538
Our clothes are
on a one-way trip to Meh City

04:07.622 --> 04:09.123
if we don't find a model fast.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.750
- I'll do it!
- Cooper!

04:10.833 --> 04:13.169
I'll take that as a no!

04:16.380 --> 04:20.051
Okay, model hopefuls, we need someone
to bring our clothes to life.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.804
Yeah, so really strut your stuff.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.477
I like it.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.895
Not intense enough.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.322
I like it.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.448
Too intense.

04:46.911 --> 04:50.623
Uh, it's called runway walking,
not runway weird hovering.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.086
Hoo!

05:00.425 --> 05:02.260
Uh... sorry!

05:02.343 --> 05:05.263
This just feels too weird!

05:06.931 --> 05:09.726
Naked for life!

05:10.893 --> 05:13.646
Ugh, we're not getting anywhere.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.940
Nova's going to hate our clothes.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.775
Will I?

05:17.859 --> 05:19.402
Ha!

05:19.485 --> 05:21.446
Sharp inhale!

05:21.529 --> 05:23.406
Nova Swift.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.950
Don't give up, nuggets.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.161
Your designs reflect your relationship,

05:28.244 --> 05:31.164
full of conflict and turmoil.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.541
You just need a model
who can showcase that,

05:33.624 --> 05:36.127
someone savage and raw.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.757
Stubborn grass stains. Gah!

05:52.018 --> 05:53.895
Oh, yeah.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.438
So savage.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.689
So raw.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.524
Sizzle!

06:01.194 --> 06:03.237
You want me to be a fashion model?

06:03.321 --> 06:05.114
Yes. I'll give you anything.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.324
Please, please, please.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.701
Agreed. Satin will give you anything.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.412
Please, please, please.
Please, please, please.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.413
Okay, I'm in.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.665
Please, please, please. Wait. What?

06:14.749 --> 06:17.585
I'm in. It'll knock something off
my bunker list.

06:17.668 --> 06:19.670
Take a bath, eat cooked food,

06:19.754 --> 06:20.963
befriend a glow bug,

06:21.047 --> 06:21.923
get ripped,

06:22.006 --> 06:23.257
learn to play sweet jams,

06:23.341 --> 06:24.675
find Baldo...

06:24.759 --> 06:27.178
Here it is. Get a makeover.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.806
Uh, Poppy added that one.

06:29.889 --> 06:33.392
You're one step closer
to being normal. Yay!

06:34.769 --> 06:36.479
"Hug a baby puffalo"?

06:36.562 --> 06:37.980
"Learn to love again"?

06:38.064 --> 06:39.774
You let Poppy add a lot of these.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.484
Yeah, yeah, Poppy.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.444
Okay, I'll see you tonight at the show.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.403
Hair halt!

06:44.487 --> 06:45.404
Slow-mo, Branch.

06:45.488 --> 06:49.075
You've got a good look, but there's
much more to learn and little time.

06:49.158 --> 06:51.452
You're going to runway boot camp!

06:54.205 --> 06:55.706
Just walk to the end and back.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.794
No, no, no.
Eyes forward, back straight.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.838
Let me feel your boom.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.132
Uh, is this my boom?

07:04.215 --> 07:06.425
-No.
-Um, this?

07:06.509 --> 07:07.593
No!

07:08.970 --> 07:10.346
How bad is it?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.473
You look so, so gorge!

07:12.557 --> 07:15.852
Huh. I do, don't I?

07:18.229 --> 07:20.690
Can we...

07:20.773 --> 07:22.650
...push it further?

07:22.733 --> 07:24.777
Look who found their boom!

07:27.363 --> 07:28.614
Become an icon.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.908
Become... fashion.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.536
That's it. Work it!

07:33.619 --> 07:35.037
Smoldering.

07:35.121 --> 07:38.499
Keep it playful. I like. I like.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.750
- Hey, there!
- Cooper!

07:39.834 --> 07:41.419
Get out of here!

07:41.502 --> 07:43.045
Ooh, one more picture?

07:43.129 --> 07:45.631
My butt has literally never looked better.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.552
No time. The show starts soon.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.014
- Okay, one more.
- Ooh.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.605
Down in front, please.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.690
-Meep.
-Oh, my Guh!

08:05.276 --> 08:07.945
Okay, girls, five minutes,
and I'll start the show.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.531
Good luck!

08:10.615 --> 08:11.699
This is it.

08:11.782 --> 08:15.203
One night to make all our fashion dreams
come true!

08:15.286 --> 08:17.038
No pressure, Branch.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.080
No sweat.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.707
My boom is...

08:19.790 --> 08:21.209
...locked and loaded.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.752
Hmm?

08:22.835 --> 08:23.920
It certainly is!

08:24.003 --> 08:25.588
Dramatic reaction!

08:25.671 --> 08:27.256
Nova Swift!

08:27.340 --> 08:30.259
Congratulations, my nuggets!

08:30.343 --> 08:32.803
I knew you'd find the right model.

08:32.886 --> 08:35.597
There is no denying his appeal.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.601
I can't wait to see his "smair."

08:40.269 --> 08:42.980
Break legs, beautifuls!

08:43.063 --> 08:44.232
Baller move!

08:44.315 --> 08:45.650
Branch, concentrate.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.151
Didn't you just hear Nova?

08:47.235 --> 08:49.320
She expects to see you smair.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.656
Whoa, calm down. What's a smair?

08:51.739 --> 08:53.991
It means smile with your hair.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.327
It's a move
in every great model's toolbox.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.621
So, uh, like this?

08:59.997 --> 09:01.749
Is this a joke? Is he joking?

09:01.832 --> 09:03.834
Here, it's like this.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.503
Windswept with mystique.

09:05.586 --> 09:06.921
No, no, no.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.715
It's more like voluminous and cagey.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.926
No, it's like this!

09:14.929 --> 09:17.431
I think you sprained my hair.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.185
Yep.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.728
Well, that's it.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.022
We are officially meh in the water.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.483
Yeah, so long, fashion dreams.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.901
Guys, guys, guys.

09:28.985 --> 09:32.154
Your dreams don't have to be over
if you don't want them to be.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.990
We need a model, Branch.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.408
I'm looking at two.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.451
Us, walk?

09:37.535 --> 09:38.411
But we're never...

09:38.494 --> 09:39.954
-In sync.
-In sync.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.582
Can't you see they're never in sync?

09:42.665 --> 09:45.418
Okay, okay, I'm leaving.

09:45.501 --> 09:48.588
Well, if you don't do it,
then it really is over.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.508
This is it, Trolls.

09:52.592 --> 09:56.220
Introducing the new line
from Satin and Chenille:

09:56.304 --> 09:57.680
Division.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.515
Hmm.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.234
Uh...

10:10.318 --> 10:11.819
be patient, everyone.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.822
Let's just give them another second.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.032
Oh.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.201
I have just been informed
a problem has come up

10:19.285 --> 10:21.996
and the models won't be coming out
from behind the curtain...

10:23.164 --> 10:24.332
Hmm.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.250
...because they'd rather

10:26.334 --> 10:27.501
be more dramatic!

10:27.585 --> 10:28.419
Hmm?

10:28.502 --> 10:30.296
It's showtime!

10:37.678 --> 10:38.971
Power strut.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.140
Ooh!

10:46.312 --> 10:47.313
Mirror!

10:48.731 --> 10:50.858
Smair.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.361
Ooh!

10:53.444 --> 10:55.655
Wow. They've never been more in sync!

10:55.738 --> 10:56.739
Amazing!

10:56.822 --> 10:59.533
And now the climactic...

10:59.617 --> 11:00.576
Turn!

11:05.748 --> 11:07.291
Oh, my Guh.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.376
-You always have to go first!
-What is wrong with you?

11:08.459 --> 11:10.544
-We always turn left!
-We always turn right!

11:11.962 --> 11:13.130
I've seen enough.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.884
Nuggets, your modeling is so...

11:16.967 --> 11:19.011
so...

11:19.095 --> 11:20.388
sizzle.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.607
You did good, sis.

11:31.690 --> 11:32.650
No.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.944
You did good, sis.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.571
We all did good, sis.

11:37.655 --> 11:41.117
Cooper!

11:41.200 --> 11:43.619
Whoo! This cliff came out of nowhere!

11:48.916 --> 11:51.377
Oh, yeah, these pillows are ripe.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.922
Let the pillow harvest festival begin.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.884
We've got pillow rides...

12:00.719 --> 12:03.055
...pillow carving...

12:03.139 --> 12:05.266
and hot pillow cider.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.396
And, of course, our main attraction,

12:10.479 --> 12:11.856
pillow picking!

12:13.023 --> 12:15.734
I can't wait to pick a pillow,
Queen Poppy.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.946
The one my parents got me last year
just went bad.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.824
And that's how it goes,

12:21.907 --> 12:24.994
but at every new harvest,
there's one special pillow for each Troll

12:25.077 --> 12:27.413
that'll give them a full year
of perfect sleep.

12:27.496 --> 12:30.416
But how will I know
which new pillow to pick?

12:30.499 --> 12:33.335
Ah, the pillow picks you.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.378
See?

12:34.462 --> 12:36.922
Suki...

12:37.006 --> 12:39.216
Suki...

12:39.300 --> 12:42.261
I'm yours.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.304
Tight.

12:49.018 --> 12:52.897
So just keep your eyes peeled,
and eventually it'll...

12:52.980 --> 12:54.482
...call to you.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.817
Poppy...

12:56.901 --> 12:59.278
I'm yours.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.616
Branch...

13:03.699 --> 13:06.285
I'm yours.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.120
Plush yet supple.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.288
The perfect mix...

13:09.371 --> 13:10.998
Of firm and soft.

13:11.081 --> 13:11.916
It's...

13:11.999 --> 13:14.126
The pillow I was destined to have.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.586
Ah...

13:18.964 --> 13:20.674
Oh. Heh. Hi, Branch.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.259
It seems your hands are on my pillow.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.803
Actually, Poppy, your hand's on my pillow.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.055
He's already got a name.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.349
Lord Bedfellow. Hmm?

13:30.392 --> 13:32.394
One pillow chose two trolls?

13:32.478 --> 13:34.104
Has this ever happened before?

13:34.188 --> 13:35.856
Once...

13:35.940 --> 13:36.982
...many years ago,

13:37.066 --> 13:38.567
and greed for the pillow

13:38.651 --> 13:41.987
gradually drove one of the Trolls
to madness.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.157
Hold on.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.076
Who was this exactly?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.077
Eh...

13:50.621 --> 13:52.206
Sir Snooze-a-Lot is mine!

13:54.041 --> 13:55.000
Oh...

13:56.669 --> 13:58.128
Who is unimportant.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.924
The point is, you must destroy that pillow
before you destroy each other.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.220
Look out, Poppy. I'm gonna destroy you.

14:06.303 --> 14:07.930
No, I'll destroy you.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.598
- Hmm.
- Dad, come on.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.017
We can resolve who gets the pillow
in a fair way.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.228
Yeah, we just need to decide how.

14:14.311 --> 14:16.355
Uh, hair, paper, scissors or maybe a--

14:16.438 --> 14:19.233
Pillow fight! Pillow fight!

14:19.316 --> 14:20.317
That could be fun.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.360
Sounds good to me.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.486
Pillows at high noon.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.363
Last Troll standing takes the prize,

14:24.446 --> 14:27.908
which, until then, will be held
by an impartial third party.

14:27.992 --> 14:31.829
See, Dad? A friendly solution
without anyone going insane.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.582
Now pillow each other... to the death!

14:34.665 --> 14:37.918
Oh.

14:38.002 --> 14:41.255
And so it begins.

14:48.679 --> 14:49.513
Hmm.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.144
Ah! Ooh! Yah!

14:55.227 --> 14:57.021
A sneak attack?

14:57.104 --> 15:00.274
Oh, I am gonna wreck
your whole world, son!

15:00.357 --> 15:02.318
Not if I wreck yours first!

15:04.820 --> 15:06.363
Hey!

15:06.447 --> 15:08.198
You're gonna wake the baby.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.201
Shh.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.120
Oh, sorry, Gia.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.538
We'll--we'll keep it down.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.834
Yeah, got ya. Yeah.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.974
Ah!

15:34.058 --> 15:39.271
Uh...

15:40.230 --> 15:41.398
Gah!

15:48.364 --> 15:49.949
Hmm.

15:50.032 --> 15:54.203
You know, the nice thing would be
to let me have my pillow back.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.332
Don't let her take me, Branch.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.043
I'm yours.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.378
Sorry, Poppy.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.713
I mean this
in the friendliest way possible.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.507
Aah!

16:06.590 --> 16:08.968
What a twist.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.637
Three on one? That's not very friendly.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.433
You guys know what to do. In three, two...

16:17.768 --> 16:20.354
No, not a song and dance number!

16:20.437 --> 16:23.774
Ha! Looks like you forgot
you were fighting with Trolls!

16:29.363 --> 16:30.239
Come on, guys, this isn't--

17:03.063 --> 17:05.441
Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.694
Oh, yeah, let's finally finish this.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.113
See?

17:11.195 --> 17:14.657
The desire for that pillow
is consuming your very souls!

17:14.742 --> 17:16.702
What?

17:16.785 --> 17:18.912
Consuming our souls?

17:18.996 --> 17:22.290
Dad, this fight has been
the definition of civility.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.464
Well, if this is so civil,
then you'll have to quit,

17:28.547 --> 17:31.967
because it's time
for Mags Gumdrop's improv show.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.053
Oh, my Guh. We can't miss that.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.097
Mags makes up skits
based on audience suggestions.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.058
It's like magic.

17:39.141 --> 17:42.227
Huh. I did RSVP.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.937
It'd be rude not to go.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.231
Lord Bedfellow is just a pillow.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.358
Got to keep it in perspective.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.486
Pick this up tomorrow, buddy?

17:50.569 --> 17:53.864
How's Misty Meadows at dawn, pal?

17:55.365 --> 17:58.160
Actually, Poppy,
you and I are having waffles at dawn.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.829
Fine. Ten o'clock?

18:01.997 --> 18:03.207
Ooh...

18:03.290 --> 18:04.249
heavy breakfast?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.293
I'd want some time to digest.

18:06.376 --> 18:07.544
-Yeah, good point.
-Mm-hmm.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.463
Let's say 10:30-ish.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.800
Fine, but no using this truce
to try anything sneaky.

18:12.883 --> 18:13.759
Fine.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.972
And so...

18:19.056 --> 18:20.891
it reaches its midpoint.

18:28.232 --> 18:32.986
Ah, I love the smell
of pillows in the morning.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.238
Smells like...

18:36.907 --> 18:38.325
...victory.

18:38.408 --> 18:42.246
You might as well give up now, Poppy,
because there's no--

18:43.831 --> 18:46.250
Hey, you gathered an army!

18:46.333 --> 18:47.709
That's sneaky!

18:47.793 --> 18:50.754
Well, you built a castle--even sneakier!

18:52.965 --> 18:55.259
Sorry. Don't know what that was.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.469
Yeah. Weird.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.304
Branch, this is crazy.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.348
No pillow can be worth all of this.

19:01.431 --> 19:05.144
- Let's just agree--
- Poppy.

19:05.227 --> 19:08.188
Finish him, Poppy.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.481
Finish him.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.567
For Lord Bedfellow!

19:12.818 --> 19:14.236
Prepare for battle!

19:22.369 --> 19:23.787
I won't lie to you, men.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.373
Fight, and you may get hit by pillows.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.292
Run, and you won't.

19:28.375 --> 19:32.379
But many years from now,
you'll wish you could trade all the days,

19:32.462 --> 19:34.590
from this day to that one,

19:34.673 --> 19:37.384
for one chance--one chance--

19:37.467 --> 19:40.721
to show them
that they may hit us with pillows,

19:40.804 --> 19:44.224
but they're going to get hit
by pillows, too!

19:46.727 --> 19:47.895
Charge!

19:47.978 --> 19:49.938
Charge!

19:58.655 --> 19:59.489
Ha!

20:01.033 --> 20:03.410
Wait. Aren't we on the same team?

20:03.493 --> 20:05.204
Oh, that's right.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.544
Oh, my Guh.

20:12.628 --> 20:16.673
The beauty of nature
illuminates the savagery of war.

20:19.009 --> 20:22.054
Oh, my Guh!

20:22.137 --> 20:22.971
Now!

20:27.017 --> 20:30.270
Lord Bedfellow will be mine, Branch!

20:30.354 --> 20:31.813
It's over!

20:31.897 --> 20:33.232
Wrong, Poppy.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.150
It's just begun.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.240
Oh, no.

20:49.539 --> 20:51.124
Whoa.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.507
No, Gristle, ease up!

21:12.562 --> 21:15.691
Why? Why?

21:20.028 --> 21:21.947
Stay with me.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.700
No. No!

21:24.783 --> 21:29.496
No!

21:29.579 --> 21:31.707
What hath we wrought?

21:31.790 --> 21:33.125
Dad was right.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.585
We have to destroy Lord Bedfellow...

21:35.669 --> 21:36.670
together.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.485
And so it ends.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.697
Everyone,
you got to check this out.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.407
Wait. No, check that.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.367
I found something kind of strange.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.953
It's a wooden chest

22:10.037 --> 22:13.540
filled with troll wigs and clothes
and masks of us...

22:13.623 --> 22:17.919
and, look, some sort of journal
detailing our habits and routines.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.755
I don't get it. Why would anyone hide

22:19.838 --> 22:22.341
all these weird items
out here in the middle of nowhere?

22:22.424 --> 22:23.717
I'll tell you why.

22:23.800 --> 22:27.262
Because someone's pretending
to be a Troll to spy on us.

22:27.345 --> 22:30.015
There's an impostor in our midst.

22:31.641 --> 22:36.480
And so it's to be continued!

22:40.442 --> 22:41.276
Ah!
