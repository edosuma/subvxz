01:35.300 --> 01:37.767
Ah. Ooh.

01:38.367 --> 01:41.201
Ah, it-- It hurts me
to see you in pain.

01:42.834 --> 01:45.667
See? All better.

01:47.367 --> 01:48.500
What are you doing?

01:48.534 --> 01:50.834
Checking for my nipple.

01:55.634 --> 01:56.600
Where's Mr. Fluffy?

01:56.634 --> 01:57.800
Your cat?

01:57.834 --> 02:00.066
He was hungry, so I threw him
out the window.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.667
Pop!

02:05.133 --> 02:06.467
Awww...

02:06.501 --> 02:09.300
Mr. Fluffy.

02:10.133 --> 02:12.900
Pop, don't kid me
like that.

02:12.934 --> 02:15.767
But I know you love
Mr. Fluffy.

02:15.801 --> 02:17.233
Now, go on,
kiss him.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.800
I'll do better
than that.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.333
I'll give him
grow wings.

02:21.367 --> 02:22.900
Sit down.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.368
I'm makin' breakfast
this morning.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.800
W- w-wait a minute.
Use a napkin.

02:43.868 --> 02:46.300
You wouldn't perchance
be miffed at me

02:46.334 --> 02:48.066
because I lost the fight,
would ya?

02:48.100 --> 02:50.733
"Lost" is such
a harsh word.

02:50.767 --> 02:54.434
Let's just say
ya came in second.

02:56.067 --> 02:57.033
Here.

02:57.067 --> 02:59.334
I got a special treat
for ya.

03:01.133 --> 03:03.800
Hey, don't worry.

03:03.834 --> 03:06.233
There are plenty of other
opportunities out there

03:06.267 --> 03:08.633
for a smart guy
like me.

03:08.667 --> 03:12.001
Uh, definitely,
definitely.

03:13.167 --> 03:16.667
Name any one
of the Great Lakes.

03:17.934 --> 03:19.099
Lake Folbert.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.099
Remember?

03:21.133 --> 03:23.633
Where you taught me
how to swim?

03:24.267 --> 03:26.734
What a great lake.

03:28.334 --> 03:30.667
Hey, I'm still gonna
make ya proud of me.

03:30.701 --> 03:32.300
I used a couple
of your connections

03:32.334 --> 03:33.533
in the business world,

03:33.567 --> 03:36.700
and I got myself
a job as a busboy.

03:38.434 --> 03:40.733
A busboy?
Hey, that's great.

03:40.767 --> 03:43.767
Say, bring me home
a half-eaten roll, will ya?

03:45.467 --> 03:48.066
We need a new plan
for you.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.600
I want more
for you than...

03:50.634 --> 03:52.800
Than just being me.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.368
As wonderful
as I am.

04:02.567 --> 04:05.600
You know, Pop, you and Mom
were a lot alike.

04:05.634 --> 04:08.233
One of the last things
she said to me was,

04:08.267 --> 04:12.867
"Whatever you be,
be more than your father."

04:17.466 --> 04:19.267
Hi, Vinnie.
Hi, Mona.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.400
Vinnie,

04:25.434 --> 04:26.767
why don't you
tell your father

04:26.801 --> 04:29.400
that my mom needs everything
in her apartment fixed...

04:29.434 --> 04:30.500
now.

04:30.534 --> 04:32.900
Everything
in her apartment? Why?

04:32.934 --> 04:37.600
Because then we can spend
the next two weeks alone.

04:38.501 --> 04:39.633
Hey.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.800
Mona, Mona, Mona.

04:43.434 --> 04:44.733
Hoy! Hey-y.

04:44.767 --> 04:46.400
Why don't you come back
a little later?

04:46.434 --> 04:47.867
Really? When?

04:47.901 --> 04:50.301
When you're
no longer a felony.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.567
Where is he?

05:16.868 --> 05:18.401
Charlie!

05:18.901 --> 05:19.867
Hey, Al.

05:19.901 --> 05:21.500
Vinnie!
Heh-heh-heh!

05:21.534 --> 05:25.266
So, Al, did you happen
to watch the kid's fight?

05:25.300 --> 05:27.300
Naw, naw, I listened to it
on the radio.

05:27.334 --> 05:30.099
Naw, I was gonna watch it
on TV, but, uh, heh,

05:30.133 --> 05:31.400
I don't have
one anymore.

05:31.434 --> 05:33.633
I bet it
on your kid.

05:35.534 --> 05:38.700
Easy, Al.
Listen, Al.

05:38.734 --> 05:40.999
I know
that feels good,

05:41.033 --> 05:42.800
but, uh, it's not gonna
bring your TV back.

05:42.834 --> 05:45.200
No, that TV was
my baby.

05:45.234 --> 05:47.834
Got me through
a lot of rough times.

05:47.868 --> 05:50.867
I watched it when
we conceived our two kids.

05:50.901 --> 05:54.266
I still remember putting
my forearm in Peg's mouth

05:54.300 --> 05:56.767
<i>to shut her up,
so I could hear Get Smart.</i>

05:58.701 --> 06:00.667
Yeah, for Bud...
For Bud I wised up.

06:00.701 --> 06:02.133
Put her head
by the foot of the bed,

06:02.167 --> 06:04.201
so I could watch too.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.567
Now it doesn't matter
which way I turn her,

06:07.601 --> 06:09.800
the magic is gone.

06:09.834 --> 06:13.633
Mr. Bundy,
I'll buy you a TV.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.567
I got a new job.

06:15.601 --> 06:17.467
Yeah.
Share my pride.

06:17.501 --> 06:20.067
He's a busboy.

06:20.667 --> 06:24.401
Al, you're not much more
than a busboy.

06:25.434 --> 06:27.500
My kid's at
a difficult age,

06:27.534 --> 06:29.734
where he just might
turn into a you.

06:32.033 --> 06:34.467
Help him out.
Give him some advice.

06:34.501 --> 06:37.166
Don't marry.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.233
Don't marry!

06:40.267 --> 06:42.999
It's only good
for the woman.

06:43.033 --> 06:44.700
Yeah, see,
women got it made.

06:44.734 --> 06:46.400
They find some guy to marry,

06:46.434 --> 06:49.734
then they steal his youth,
his paycheck and his dreams.

06:50.434 --> 06:52.867
Oh, yeah,
then their butt gets big.

06:54.334 --> 06:56.333
Then you die,
their butt gets smaller

06:56.367 --> 06:58.167
till the next guy
comes along.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.934
Oh, no,
next to being a dog,

07:00.968 --> 07:03.166
a beautiful woman
is the thing to be.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.999
I'm sorry, Al, but you don't
have the butt

07:05.033 --> 07:06.200
to be a beautiful woman.

07:06.234 --> 07:09.867
Ehh, I let myself go.

07:09.901 --> 07:11.500
Hey, don't run yourself down.

07:11.534 --> 07:13.934
Ya still got
a beautiful smile.

07:15.934 --> 07:18.166
Uh... Uh...

07:18.200 --> 07:21.333
Do you two wanna be alone
or anything?

07:21.367 --> 07:24.467
Do you mind? He was just gonna
say something nice to me.

07:24.501 --> 07:26.433
Ah, the moment's past.

07:26.467 --> 07:30.066
You know what we shoulda done
when we were young studs?

07:30.100 --> 07:31.099
What?

07:31.133 --> 07:33.400
Married us a couple
of rich babes.

07:33.434 --> 07:34.767
See, that way
all we'd have to do

07:34.801 --> 07:36.099
is get up late...
Yeah.

07:36.133 --> 07:38.333
pump a little iron
to stay in shape...
Yeah.

07:38.367 --> 07:40.366
let the robe pop open
a little to show the maid

07:40.400 --> 07:42.900
what she could have
if she saved her pennies...

07:44.667 --> 07:46.099
and settle back
on the couch,

07:46.133 --> 07:47.733
get stinking drunk
and pick your feet

07:47.767 --> 07:50.700
till the cows come home.

07:50.734 --> 07:54.800
I can't think of a fuller,
more satisfying life.

07:54.834 --> 07:58.266
Ah, but time
has passed us by.

07:58.300 --> 07:59.966
Young women today
don't understand it.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.300
We don't wanna go right
to sleep after sex.

08:02.334 --> 08:04.101
We have to.

08:05.601 --> 08:08.368
Ah, I guess it's
a young man's world.

08:12.300 --> 08:17.134
I think I am getting
a new Verducci master plan.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.266
No.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.966
Please, no.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.467
Yes.

08:22.501 --> 08:23.900
Ooh, I love this plan.

08:23.934 --> 08:25.233
For it to work,

08:25.267 --> 08:27.633
you are gonna have
to meet a rich woman.

08:27.667 --> 08:29.333
No, no, no, I know
what you're gonna say.

08:29.367 --> 08:31.999
There's a shortage
of rich women in our tenement.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.265
H- hey, Charlie.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.133
I was thinking
about what you were saying,

08:36.167 --> 08:38.033
but I don't have to
go to sleep after sex.

08:38.067 --> 08:41.400
Iwanna go to sleep
after sex.

08:41.433 --> 08:44.034
I-- I welcome the darkness.

08:45.300 --> 08:48.533
Anyhow, there'll be plenty
of rich women

08:48.567 --> 08:51.667
at that fundraiser
you were busboy'ing tonight.

08:51.701 --> 08:52.834
Here's my plan.

08:52.868 --> 08:55.200
We go, we have
a bite to eat,

08:55.234 --> 08:57.366
and you marry
a millionaire.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.934
You with me?

08:58.968 --> 09:00.700
No.

09:01.701 --> 09:03.400
He's so cute.

09:03.434 --> 09:05.700
He thinks
he has a vote.

09:13.467 --> 09:14.633
See?

09:14.667 --> 09:16.433
What's so difficult?

09:16.467 --> 09:19.333
Stand on a couple
of garbage cans,

09:19.367 --> 09:21.600
you break a window...

09:24.167 --> 09:27.300
...and you're
in high society.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.700
Let's go charm the crap
out of these people.

09:32.634 --> 09:34.200
Look...

09:34.234 --> 09:36.166
you don't have
to worry.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.333
<i>To prepare us,
I have read Trump,</i>

09:39.367 --> 09:41.266
<i>The Wall Street Journal,</i>

09:41.300 --> 09:45.500
<i>and a magazine called
Rich Babes in Chains.</i>

09:48.834 --> 09:50.667
Now, I have distilled
their wisdom

09:50.701 --> 09:52.200
into three key phrases.

09:52.234 --> 09:55.066
So if you get confused,
simply say either,

09:55.100 --> 09:57.733
"How about that market?"

09:57.767 --> 10:00.834
"Damn Democrats,"

10:00.868 --> 10:04.900
or, "Punish me.
I've been very, very bad."

10:06.667 --> 10:10.333
As for myself, I'm not worried.
'Cause, hey, I fit in anywhere.

10:10.367 --> 10:13.034
You, over here.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.700
You call this a meatball?

10:20.701 --> 10:24.600
Bet a couple of days ago,
it had a saddle on it.

10:24.634 --> 10:26.934
Be gone.

10:28.868 --> 10:31.333
We're gonna get
thrown out of here.

10:31.367 --> 10:32.733
We don't belong.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.900
See, Pop, it's like I learned
in high school.

10:34.934 --> 10:37.999
This famous
philosopher--

10:38.033 --> 10:39.467
I can't remember
his name.

10:39.501 --> 10:42.734
-- said, "The poor..."

10:44.300 --> 10:47.366
Jeez, I don't remember
what he said either.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.033
What'd he say?

10:49.067 --> 10:50.300
I don't know.

10:50.334 --> 10:52.900
The point is,
we're poor, they're rich.

10:52.934 --> 10:54.366
That's the way
it should be.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.633
They're just better
than us, that's all.

10:56.667 --> 10:57.633
Hey, I know who it was.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.468
It was the Greek guy there,
Pluto.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.533
Nelson!

11:02.567 --> 11:04.233
You were away
all summer.

11:04.267 --> 11:06.099
Well, it gets
insufferably warm in August,

11:06.133 --> 11:07.867
so we took the yacht
to the Greek islands.

11:07.901 --> 11:08.966
Ah.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.099
And then my Puffy just had
to go to Madrid

11:11.133 --> 11:13.066
to pick some tapestries
for the new villa.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.433
Yes, I know
how that is. Ha-ha!

11:15.467 --> 11:17.099
Oh, look, uh...
The meatballs.

11:17.133 --> 11:18.633
Huh.

11:22.667 --> 11:25.333
That's better than us?

11:25.367 --> 11:27.333
Hey, they couldn't live
for one minute

11:27.367 --> 11:28.633
in our neighborhood,

11:28.667 --> 11:31.434
but I could live
a lifetime in theirs.

11:32.534 --> 11:33.800
And I intend to.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.033
Pop.

11:35.067 --> 11:36.999
No, Pop. Don't.

11:37.033 --> 11:38.900
Nelson!

11:39.767 --> 11:41.999
Charles.

11:42.033 --> 11:43.999
Verducci.

11:44.033 --> 11:47.066
Greece, at
the yacht club.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.767
Say, did Puffy get
those tapestries

11:49.801 --> 11:52.033
she was
talking about?

11:52.067 --> 11:53.166
You know
that Puffster.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.800
She always gets
what she's after,

11:54.834 --> 11:58.934
and as I recall,
she was always after this guy.

12:01.901 --> 12:03.467
Same old Charles.

12:03.501 --> 12:05.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Same old Charles.

12:06.901 --> 12:10.834
Well, you boys seem
to be having fun.

12:10.868 --> 12:12.867
I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

12:12.901 --> 12:13.900
Well, allow me.

12:13.934 --> 12:14.934
Uh, Kathleen Morgan,

12:14.968 --> 12:17.999
meet my very dear friend,
uh-- Uh--

12:18.033 --> 12:20.034
Charles Verducci,
what do you say?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.133
Well, I see
by your shirt

12:24.167 --> 12:26.966
that you've been sampling
our meatballs.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.867
And I see
by your shirt

12:28.901 --> 12:31.800
you got mighty
powerful buttons.

12:36.901 --> 12:39.333
Okay, if he can do it,

12:39.367 --> 12:40.867
I can do it.

12:41.501 --> 12:43.633
I'm a rich guy.
I fit in.

12:44.801 --> 12:47.533
How 'bout that market?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.234
What about it?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.900
Damn Democrats.

12:57.934 --> 12:59.834
What about them?

13:12.868 --> 13:16.600
Uh, punish me.
I've been very, very bad.

13:20.434 --> 13:23.567
United Chemical, that's where
I'm putting my money.

13:23.601 --> 13:25.066
Well, I think
it's overpriced.

13:25.100 --> 13:28.800
Stick with the blue chip
IBM.

13:28.834 --> 13:31.533
What do you like,
Charles?

13:32.701 --> 13:36.368
Long hair, short dresses
and big hooters.

13:43.434 --> 13:45.700
Hey, sweetheart.
How you doin'?

13:45.734 --> 13:47.500
You-- You've been to a lot
of these things.

13:47.534 --> 13:48.567
Let me ask you something:

13:48.601 --> 13:50.300
Do I look like
I belong here?

13:50.334 --> 13:54.200
You look like you belong
anywhere you wanna be.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.300
Well, where I wanna be
is in a cold place

13:56.334 --> 13:57.800
holding a warm you.

13:57.834 --> 14:01.468
What do you say after this
fiasco, you and I go-- Ah!

14:03.501 --> 14:04.934
What the hell
are you doing?

14:04.968 --> 14:06.867
We're not here
to bag a waitress.

14:06.901 --> 14:08.533
I like waitresses.

14:08.567 --> 14:10.233
I like waitresses too.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.066
But tonight,
we're after bigger game.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.800
Now, go mingle
with the rich.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.033
Pop,
why is it always me

14:15.067 --> 14:17.233
in the Verducci
master plan, huh?

14:17.267 --> 14:19.033
I'm tired of being
the pawn

14:19.067 --> 14:21.500
in your cosmic
game of checkers.

14:23.033 --> 14:24.500
Why don't you marry
a millionaire?

14:24.534 --> 14:25.500
Me?

14:25.534 --> 14:27.200
Yeah.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.966
You got a real cute one
over there

14:29.000 --> 14:31.034
giving you
the buffalo eye.

14:31.901 --> 14:33.099
Oh, yeah? Who?

14:33.133 --> 14:34.633
Over there.

14:40.767 --> 14:44.233
Oh, would that
it could be.

14:44.267 --> 14:46.266
But that one,
see, she's married.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.033
In fact, to two guys.

14:48.067 --> 14:49.500
So, hey, if one of 'em
drops dead,

14:49.534 --> 14:50.999
I'm still out of luck.

14:51.033 --> 14:52.700
Huh? You get it?
I got it.

14:52.734 --> 14:53.999
Huh? You okay?
Yeah.

14:54.033 --> 14:56.133
Good. Now, so get back
to work, okay?

14:56.167 --> 14:59.600
And just think millionaire,
millionaire, millionaire.

14:59.634 --> 15:02.167
Millionaire.
Millionaire.

15:03.133 --> 15:05.099
Millionaire.
Millionaire.

15:05.133 --> 15:08.401
Did you know
I was a millionaire?

15:21.467 --> 15:24.600
Miss, excuse me. I think
you dropped your purse.

15:24.634 --> 15:26.234
Oh.

15:30.033 --> 15:31.200
Thank you.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.767
Thankyou.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.334
Oh, ho-ho-ho-ho!

15:50.300 --> 15:54.867
You just wanted to see me
bend over, didn't you?

15:54.901 --> 15:57.099
What were you thinking?

15:57.133 --> 15:58.266
Well, let's just say

15:58.300 --> 16:02.267
I retasted that meatball
I ate awhile ago.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.467
Oh, your son seems
to be

16:04.501 --> 16:07.401
quite popular
with our young ladies.

16:12.501 --> 16:14.333
Kid's got
the Verducci charm.

16:14.367 --> 16:18.667
No, I've got
the Verducci charm.

16:19.767 --> 16:22.967
You're not allowed
in the men's room, are ya?

16:23.501 --> 16:24.700
Of course not.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.967
Well, that's
where I'll be.

16:31.167 --> 16:33.133
It's an interesting point,
Nelson.

16:33.167 --> 16:34.700
Very well put.

16:34.734 --> 16:36.233
I don't want
to give my son a job

16:36.267 --> 16:38.999
in any of
my many companies.

16:39.033 --> 16:41.467
That's no way
to learn responsibility.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.567
So I'm wondering maybe,
you know, you can give him

16:43.601 --> 16:45.366
some kind
of an executive position.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.900
But, hey,
don't spoil the boy.

16:46.934 --> 16:50.533
Start him off at, what,
three, four hundred thousand.

16:50.567 --> 16:52.333
Dollars?

16:52.367 --> 16:55.234
Go back to nodding.

16:55.701 --> 16:57.301
So, what do you say?

16:58.667 --> 16:59.966
Where did the boy
go to school?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.934
Uh, P.S. 124.

17:03.033 --> 17:04.165
Yale.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.165
Oh, my son went to Yale.
Uh, let me call him over.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.400
Did I say Yale?
Silly me.

17:09.434 --> 17:10.800
I meant to say
Harvard.

17:10.834 --> 17:13.400
Now, my son went
to Harvard.

17:13.434 --> 17:14.500
Um, let me call
him over--

17:14.534 --> 17:16.800
I didn't mean Harvard.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.900
Where did I go?

17:19.601 --> 17:21.333
Go over there.

17:21.367 --> 17:22.900
Over there?
Yeah, over there.

17:22.934 --> 17:24.633
Okay, I'll
be over here.

17:27.567 --> 17:29.834
Okay, here's the truth.

17:31.400 --> 17:35.066
Once, he was
a very promising scholar,

17:35.100 --> 17:37.533
but then he had
this tricycle accident.

17:38.834 --> 17:40.733
Okay, here's the truth.

17:40.767 --> 17:42.567
Look, we know
each other for so long,

17:42.601 --> 17:44.867
we're such good friends, I feel
I can be honest with you.

17:44.901 --> 17:46.867
Now, I should have
mentioned it in Greece,

17:46.901 --> 17:48.999
but, you know, yacht,

17:49.033 --> 17:51.934
tapestries, Zorba...

17:51.968 --> 17:53.633
So here it is.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.800
The kid's a genius,

17:55.834 --> 17:57.733
but he's lazy.

17:57.767 --> 17:58.966
So I'm thinking,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.633
I'll cut him off,
you give him a job,

18:00.667 --> 18:01.733
but he's gotta make due

18:01.767 --> 18:04.999
on the lousy 400 grand
a year you pay him.

18:05.033 --> 18:07.201
Let him suffer a little.

18:07.701 --> 18:09.767
It works.

18:11.033 --> 18:13.767
That's what my dad
had to do to me.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.733
Now, I learned
my lesson.
Yeah.

18:16.767 --> 18:18.733
Well, then we're
in agreement.
Hm.

18:18.767 --> 18:21.066
Oh, Charles.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.633
Oh, I'm sorry
to drag him away,

18:22.667 --> 18:25.133
but this is
very important.

18:25.167 --> 18:27.033
Charles.

18:27.067 --> 18:28.733
I was hoping
to see you

18:28.767 --> 18:30.900
at the Littlefield
party next week,

18:30.934 --> 18:33.900
but I checked and your name
is not on the guest list.

18:33.934 --> 18:37.033
Oh, it's
a horrible oversight.

18:37.067 --> 18:38.333
By the way, are, uh,

18:38.367 --> 18:41.999
my dear friends Roger
and Nelson gonna be there?

18:42.033 --> 18:43.066
Why, yes.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.633
Well, then I must
be there too.

18:45.667 --> 18:49.134
Oh, I'm afraid
it's just impossible.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.266
<i>Ah, what the hell.</i>

18:54.300 --> 18:56.334
<i>I was a Marine.</i>

19:08.300 --> 19:10.368
The party's at 8:30.

19:20.167 --> 19:21.600
How you doing, Pop?

19:21.634 --> 19:26.001
Great. I'm even starting to get
some feeling back in my tongue.

19:26.968 --> 19:28.099
You know,
it's amazing.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.966
I was just musing
about our evening.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.066
You know, the difference,
yet the sameness,

19:33.100 --> 19:35.099
between the rich
and poor.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.767
And as the philosopher--

19:37.801 --> 19:39.366
I can't remember
his name.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.366
-- said,

19:40.400 --> 19:42.834
"The rich..."

19:42.868 --> 19:45.800
No, no. "The poor..."

19:45.834 --> 19:46.934
No, wait.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.834
Jeez, I don't remember
what the guy said.

19:48.868 --> 19:52.233
But I remember,
it shaped my young life.

19:52.267 --> 19:55.033
What the hell
was it?

19:55.067 --> 19:58.200
Doesn't matter.
You got the gist of it.

19:58.234 --> 19:59.600
The important thing is

19:59.634 --> 20:04.166
that through my God-given
charm and Verducciness,

20:04.200 --> 20:06.066
my master plan is working.

20:06.100 --> 20:08.400
And I got phone numbers
shoved in my pocket

20:08.434 --> 20:10.800
by every pretty girl
in that room.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.333
So I guess
what I'm saying is,

20:12.367 --> 20:13.900
I won't be home nights

20:13.934 --> 20:16.600
for about a year.

20:16.634 --> 20:19.266
Wait a minute. You're not gonna
sleep with any of them

20:19.300 --> 20:21.767
till we got a commitment.

20:24.801 --> 20:26.867
We gotta start
thinking like women.

20:26.901 --> 20:30.633
No band on the hand,
no nookie for cookie.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.900
Not even the one

20:35.934 --> 20:39.134
who dots the I in her name
with her mouth?

20:41.801 --> 20:43.633
No.

20:43.667 --> 20:45.300
You're just gonna
have to follow

20:45.334 --> 20:47.099
the Verducci master plan,

20:47.133 --> 20:50.900
or bad things will happen
to Mr. Fluffy.

20:51.934 --> 20:53.033
You wouldn't.

20:53.067 --> 20:55.533
Hey, as much as I love him,
if you say no,

20:55.567 --> 20:58.967
he's on a plate of noodles
in a Thai restaurant.

20:59.701 --> 21:01.066
Shh. Pop, come on.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.667
You know
he understands everything.

21:02.701 --> 21:04.033
I hope so.

21:04.067 --> 21:07.066
'Cause nothing is gonna
stand in the way of my dream.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.999
You are gonna find yourself
a rich woman to marry.

21:10.033 --> 21:11.300
And even if you don't,

21:11.334 --> 21:14.033
only good things happen
when you're around money.

21:14.067 --> 21:16.333
Money gives money
good jobs.

21:16.367 --> 21:18.567
Money gives money
stock tips.

21:18.601 --> 21:19.800
And let's face it,

21:19.834 --> 21:21.966
what the hell's the worst
thing that could happen?

21:22.000 --> 21:25.034
Money could run over us
with its car.

21:26.367 --> 21:29.033
Then we sue money's ass.

21:29.067 --> 21:31.066
Oh!

21:31.100 --> 21:33.966
So are you with me?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.366
I'm with you, Pop.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.067
That's my boy.
