♪ ♪

00:13.681 --> 00:15.451
Quite a hike, Steve.

00:15.519 --> 00:16.687
Your dad used to

00:16.755 --> 00:18.815
bring you up here
when you were a kid?

00:18.883 --> 00:19.948
Every year.

00:20.016 --> 00:22.245
Yeah, well, that
will explain a lot.

00:22.780 --> 00:24.652
You can bring Gracie up here
when she gets a bit older.

00:24.739 --> 00:27.503
Grace wants to got get
a manicure and a pedicure, okay?

00:27.646 --> 00:29.311
She's not interested
in going to look

00:29.379 --> 00:31.043
at old graffiti
on rocks, okay?

00:31.111 --> 00:33.078
This is basically
child abuse.

00:33.146 --> 00:34.213
They're called
"petroglyphs," Danny.

00:34.281 --> 00:36.519
They're called
"petroglyphs."

00:36.586 --> 00:39.690
That is a fancy name for
graffiti etched in rocks, okay?

00:39.758 --> 00:42.725
You know what?
I remember the first time

00:42.793 --> 00:44.527
I beat my father to the summit.

00:44.594 --> 00:45.927
I remember like it was
yesterday.

00:45.995 --> 00:47.295
All due respect,
what's wrong

00:47.362 --> 00:49.297
with an old-fashioned
baseball game, Steve, huh?

00:49.365 --> 00:50.933
I've never been to a
professional baseball game.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.970
That doesn't surprise
me at all.

00:54.038 --> 00:55.972
I mean, how could...?
Forget about it.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.874
You know what? To each his own.

00:57.942 --> 01:01.110
We had the Yankees;
you and your old man had a...

01:01.178 --> 01:02.311
I don't know what.

01:02.379 --> 01:04.480
Deep-sea demolition classes
or something.

01:04.549 --> 01:06.617
Stop talking for a second.

01:06.684 --> 01:08.253
Look at this view.

01:08.320 --> 01:12.991
This view, this has not
changed one bit

01:13.058 --> 01:16.093
since I was a kid.

01:16.161 --> 01:17.961
Everything else has changed,

01:18.029 --> 01:19.731
but not this.

01:22.535 --> 01:23.868
You know what?

01:23.936 --> 01:26.538
I, um, I found another one
of those envelopes

01:26.606 --> 01:28.006
on my doorstep yesterday
morning.

01:28.073 --> 01:29.607
It had an old matchbook in it.

01:29.675 --> 01:31.375
Used to be
in my father's toolbox.

01:31.443 --> 01:32.343
You think it's from Wo Fat?

01:32.410 --> 01:33.410
I don't know.

01:33.478 --> 01:34.911
What does Kaye think?

01:34.979 --> 01:37.279
Kaye thinks Wo Fat's playing
a game with me.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.913
I don't understand.
What kind of game, huh?

01:38.981 --> 01:40.415
Like he's trying to get you
to believe

01:40.482 --> 01:42.016
that your father was a dirty cop
or something.

01:42.083 --> 01:44.217
Let me tell you something.
My father was such a good man

01:44.285 --> 01:45.785
and he was a great cop,
and whatever case

01:45.853 --> 01:47.286
he was working on
before he was killed,

01:47.354 --> 01:48.620
I'm gonna find out
what that was.

01:48.688 --> 01:50.722
It still doesn't explain
why someone's sending

01:50.789 --> 01:52.123
that case evidence
back to you.

01:52.191 --> 01:55.360
Maybe someone's trying
to lead me to Wo Fat.

01:55.428 --> 01:58.230
Maybe Wo Fat's trying lure you.

02:01.134 --> 02:02.568

It means "images in the stone."

Ah.

02:20.288 --> 02:22.690
This one right here,
this is Honu.

02:22.758 --> 02:23.858
It's a turtle.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.760
Yeah, that's a turtle.
Yeah.

02:25.827 --> 02:27.861
What about this guy
right here? What's this?

02:27.929 --> 02:29.229
These are symbols
of the hunt.

02:29.297 --> 02:30.697
It's pretty cool, huh?

02:30.765 --> 02:32.099
Better than
a Yankee's game?

02:32.166 --> 02:33.967
It's not even close
to as good

02:34.035 --> 02:35.702
as a Yankee's game,
but it's nice.

02:43.811 --> 02:46.813
Danny, there's someone
down there!

02:48.449 --> 02:50.049
Hey!

02:50.117 --> 02:52.318
Hey!

02:53.820 --> 02:55.020
I'm going down there.

02:55.088 --> 02:56.455
He could still be alive.

03:23.884 --> 03:26.085
Is he all right?

03:30.357 --> 03:32.124
He's dead!

He's got a gunshot wound

There's very little blood.

04:14.598 --> 04:16.800
All right, look,
there's no action up here.

04:16.868 --> 04:19.202
No signs of struggle.
Somebody dumped him.

04:19.269 --> 04:21.605
It's gotta be from a plane
or helicopter.

04:21.672 --> 04:23.673

take a picture.

We'll go for a little hike,

04:28.145 --> 04:29.646
call the crime scene unit.
Come on.

04:29.714 --> 04:33.182
I need you to take up the slack
as I climb, all right?

04:35.385 --> 04:37.053
All right, take that slack,
Danny.

04:45.630 --> 04:47.464
Hey, easy there!

04:47.532 --> 04:49.099
Take your time.

04:58.775 --> 05:00.776
Whoa!

05:02.312 --> 05:03.245
Hey, Steve!

05:06.115 --> 05:07.348
Steve!

05:07.416 --> 05:09.917
Steve! Steve!

Hey, Steve!

05:15.808 --> 05:17.609
Steve!

05:21.380 --> 05:23.415
Hey, Steve, don't move,
all right?!

05:23.482 --> 05:24.717
Just stay where you are.

05:24.784 --> 05:26.285
You all right?

05:26.353 --> 05:28.453
I'm good. I'm good.

05:32.892 --> 05:35.160
I think
my arm's broken.

05:35.228 --> 05:37.829
Can you send
that rope down?

05:38.932 --> 05:41.066
It's snagged on a branch.

05:44.638 --> 05:46.605
All right, look, I'm
gonna call for help.

05:46.673 --> 05:48.674
No, there's
no cell service here.

05:48.742 --> 05:49.675
But there is
at the summit.

05:49.743 --> 05:50.810
You need to climb up

05:50.877 --> 05:52.244
and call in a medevac team,
all right?

05:52.312 --> 05:54.213
All right, don't move,
all right?

05:54.281 --> 05:57.817
Hey, Danny, throw my pack down
before you go.

06:00.988 --> 06:03.256
All right, I got it, I got it.

06:03.324 --> 06:06.694
Hey, listen to me.
Do not move.

06:06.762 --> 06:08.563
Be careful up there.
It's really steep.

06:09.866 --> 06:11.133
All right.

06:22.511 --> 06:25.212
Ahh...

07:04.087 --> 07:06.522
All right.

07:08.658 --> 07:12.861
Uh, gunshot wound, small-
caliber, through-and-through.

07:14.764 --> 07:16.698
Wait.

07:25.374 --> 07:27.843
There's fish scales
in the exit wound.

07:35.518 --> 07:37.019
How long?

07:43.693 --> 07:45.828
I can't promise, but I'll try.

07:54.437 --> 07:55.671
Hey, gonna order

07:55.739 --> 07:57.206
some loko moko from
Ono Lau-Lau.

07:57.273 --> 07:59.041
You in?

07:59.109 --> 08:01.477
It's Auntie Mele.

08:01.545 --> 08:02.578
They called the hospice.

08:02.646 --> 08:06.082
Her kidney's
shutting down.

08:06.149 --> 08:08.017
She's asking to see everyone
tonight.

08:08.085 --> 08:12.889
I don't know if it's a good idea
for me to go by there now.

08:12.956 --> 08:15.925
Look, if you're worried what
Uncle Keako will think, don't.

08:15.993 --> 08:17.793
He's the one
who called.

08:17.861 --> 08:19.195
He did?

08:19.262 --> 08:20.630
He made me promise

08:20.698 --> 08:22.632
to bring you by
the house tonight.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.234
You forget he's a cop.

08:24.301 --> 08:27.137
He knows you've been coming by
to see her when he's not there.

08:31.509 --> 08:33.844
Danny, I thought you went

08:33.910 --> 08:35.546
on a hike with McGarrett.

08:35.613 --> 08:37.414
Steve fell. He's hurt.

08:37.482 --> 08:38.881
Whoa. What?
How bad?

08:38.950 --> 08:40.317
I don't know how bad.
I'm not a doctor.

08:40.385 --> 08:41.418
But I think he broke his arm.

08:41.486 --> 08:42.719
Where are you?

08:42.787 --> 08:44.421
You know what? Forget it.

08:44.489 --> 08:48.058
Triangulating your coordinates
off the cell phone signal.

08:48.126 --> 08:51.262
All right, listen, we need a
rescue team as soon as possible.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.597
I'll contact Army evac.
Stand by.

08:52.664 --> 08:55.099
Let me use your phone.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.400
Okay.

08:57.769 --> 08:59.403
All right, I've got
your location.

08:59.470 --> 09:01.472
Okay, listen, we need
a crime scene unit, too,

09:01.539 --> 09:02.539
as soon as possible.

09:02.607 --> 09:04.042
We found a body.
Whoa, wait.

09:04.109 --> 09:05.877
I though you said
this is a rescue mission.

09:05.945 --> 09:07.546
What's a body doing
way up there?

09:07.613 --> 09:09.648
I don't know what a body's doing
way up here.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.084
The guy doesn't look like a
hiker, mid-50s, work clothes.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.986
I'm gonna send you a picture.
Hold on.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.890
All right, I got him.
I'll run it through

09:17.957 --> 09:19.758
the system and see
if I can get an I.D.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.960
Danny, evac choppers
on it's way.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.461
All right, I'm going back.

09:34.405 --> 09:36.807
Hey, did you get reception?

09:36.875 --> 09:38.342
Yeah. Army evac's on its way.

09:38.410 --> 09:40.378
I don't think we have time,
all right?

09:40.446 --> 09:42.380
These clouds, they look bad.
If it starts raining,

09:42.448 --> 09:44.449
this place is gonna turn
into a big mudslide.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.319
All right, I'm gonna come down

09:47.386 --> 09:49.154
untangle the rope,
and I'm gonna

09:49.222 --> 09:50.322
bring it to you, all right?

09:50.390 --> 09:52.524
Hey, take it easy, all right?

10:02.935 --> 10:04.468
Hey, easy, easy. Hey!

10:04.536 --> 10:07.471
I'm not gonna catch
your ass if you fall.

10:07.538 --> 10:11.908
I'd rather you not catch me
if I fall, okay?

10:13.744 --> 10:15.846
Got it.

10:21.419 --> 10:22.987
All right.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.366
Need another doughnut.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.108
Evac's here.

10:58.457 --> 11:00.292
This is Rescue Chopper One.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.735
Commander McGarrett.
Let's get you to the hospital.

11:12.741 --> 11:15.209
In position. Extracting.

11:15.277 --> 11:17.078
Hey, Danny.

11:17.145 --> 11:19.146
Thank you.

11:30.860 --> 11:32.093
Hey, how's Steve?

11:32.161 --> 11:34.796
He shattered his forearm
and picked up some nasty gashes

11:34.864 --> 11:35.964
from the fall.
Steve is fine.

11:36.031 --> 11:37.899
That was a hell of a place
to find a body.

11:37.967 --> 11:39.534
Yeah. That far out,
whoever dumped it there

11:39.602 --> 11:40.869
probably never wanted it
to be found.

11:40.936 --> 11:42.737
Probably figured the wild
boars would vanish it.

11:42.805 --> 11:44.205
Okay. We got an ID on our vic?

11:44.273 --> 11:45.807
Yeah. His name is Jack Leung.

11:45.874 --> 11:47.676
53 years old. He has
a fishing boat license

11:47.743 --> 11:49.611
in his name that he works
with his son Sean.

11:49.679 --> 11:51.046
Fishing boat. Okay.

11:51.113 --> 11:52.848
That would explain this.

11:52.916 --> 11:53.982
What is that?

11:54.050 --> 11:55.317
This is fish scales

11:55.385 --> 11:56.518
that Steve found
around the gunshot wound.

11:56.586 --> 11:57.820
All right, well,
if they were found

11:57.887 --> 11:59.154
around the gunshot wound,

11:59.222 --> 12:00.723
maybe they were transferred
pre-body dump.

12:00.791 --> 12:02.091
From his boat?

12:02.159 --> 12:03.459
Okay, I know this
sounds ridiculous,

12:03.526 --> 12:05.227
but if we can identify these
scales, then we get close

12:05.295 --> 12:06.462
to our primary crime scene.

12:06.530 --> 12:07.730
Friend of mine's
an ichthyologist

12:07.798 --> 12:09.165
at the university. Maybe
he can identify them.

12:09.233 --> 12:10.566
Okay, uh...

12:10.634 --> 12:12.635
this guy's in our system.
What was he arrested for?

12:12.702 --> 12:14.170
All right, so according
to his record,

12:14.237 --> 12:16.806
Jack Leung was a
law-abiding citizen until

12:16.874 --> 12:18.274
three days ago,
when he was charged

12:18.342 --> 12:19.409
for assaulting another
fishing boat captain,

12:19.477 --> 12:20.810
down at the docks.

12:20.878 --> 12:22.412
Booking sheet lists

12:22.479 --> 12:24.480
a slip
down in Honolulu Harbor.

12:24.548 --> 12:26.316
Leung's Fight Club partner,

12:26.383 --> 12:28.918
Sal Groves.
Leung assaulted him

12:28.986 --> 12:30.920
with a gaffing pole.
And get this:

12:30.987 --> 12:33.188
he's a licensed
helicopter pilot.

12:33.256 --> 12:35.390
He could've used it
to dispose of the body.

12:35.458 --> 12:37.493
Oh, okay. Let's go talk to Sal,

12:37.561 --> 12:39.995
see if he knows why Leung
ended up in the jungle.

12:40.063 --> 12:41.363
Okay?

12:46.969 --> 12:49.270
So Sal's boat should
be right down there.

12:49.338 --> 12:51.772
All right, Kono, I want
you to Leung's son Sean.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.641
We'll go deal with Sal,
all right?

12:53.709 --> 12:55.677
All right, so we just
went through the loop.

12:55.744 --> 12:58.413
Now, this is the tricky part.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.348
We're going to go
around it five times,

13:00.416 --> 13:01.717
okay?

13:01.784 --> 13:04.619
Just like that.

13:05.621 --> 13:08.223
Officer Kono Kalakaua

13:08.291 --> 13:09.524
Are you Sean Leung?

13:09.592 --> 13:11.626
Yes.

13:11.694 --> 13:13.362
Hey, Brian.

13:13.429 --> 13:15.230
I want you to go
down in the hold

13:15.298 --> 13:17.666
and do this ten
more times. Okay?

13:17.733 --> 13:19.968
Okay. Go below.
Good boy.

13:22.939 --> 13:24.406
I take it
you're not

13:24.474 --> 13:27.242
here to check for my permits.

13:27.310 --> 13:29.411
I'm afraid not.

13:29.479 --> 13:33.249
I'm sorry to
inform you that...

13:33.316 --> 13:37.286
your father was found
dead this morning.

13:38.788 --> 13:40.322
How?

13:40.390 --> 13:44.260
He was shot.

13:44.327 --> 13:46.395
His body was recovered in
the mountains north of here.

13:47.564 --> 13:49.766
Oh, my God.

13:56.541 --> 13:58.075
Why would someone do this?

13:58.143 --> 14:00.144
We don't know.

14:04.883 --> 14:06.484
When was the last time
you saw him?

14:06.552 --> 14:09.188
Yesterday.

14:09.255 --> 14:11.123
He took the boat out
for a short run,

14:11.191 --> 14:13.459
and got in some nice fish
that I took to market.

14:13.526 --> 14:16.495
Did you notice anything
that was out of the ordinary?

14:18.798 --> 14:20.498
Yeah.

14:20.566 --> 14:23.601
I found my laptop on.

14:23.668 --> 14:25.335
Uh... the only
reason I noticed

14:25.403 --> 14:28.204
is 'cause I check the
weather first thing.

14:28.272 --> 14:29.539
My pops was old school.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.841
No cell phone,
no computers.

14:31.909 --> 14:35.078
The only surfing he did
was on a long board.

14:35.146 --> 14:37.080
What can you tell me
about the altercation

14:37.148 --> 14:39.617
your father had a couple days
ago with Sal Groves?

14:39.684 --> 14:42.553
He wouldn't tell me.

14:42.621 --> 14:44.889
My father didn't want
me to get involved.

14:44.957 --> 14:47.192
Said he was taking
care of it.

14:50.230 --> 14:52.531
There's our boy.

14:54.734 --> 14:56.802
Sal Groves,
Five-O!

14:56.870 --> 14:57.903
Cut your engines!

14:59.639 --> 15:01.373
He's running.
Come on!

15:11.749 --> 15:13.583
Hey!
Hey!

15:14.417 --> 15:15.851
Hands up, Ahab.
Do it!

15:15.919 --> 15:16.986
Now!

15:17.053 --> 15:17.887
All right.

15:17.954 --> 15:18.955
Thank you.

15:27.138 --> 15:28.389
<i>So why don't you save us</i>
<i>a little time,</i>

15:28.461 --> 15:30.461
tell us why you decided
to go for a little jog.

15:30.465 --> 15:32.233
'Cause I love cops so much.

15:34.335 --> 15:37.070
You know, I-I-I told him,
when I was thinking this.

15:37.138 --> 15:38.871
I know why you
were running.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.173
So why don't you just sit
here and ponder your love

15:41.241 --> 15:42.908
for law enforcement, while he
goes and searches your boat.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.877
You can't search the boat
without a warrant.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.746
Really? Watch.
What are you...

15:48.849 --> 15:50.851
Hey! You can't do that!

15:50.919 --> 15:52.086
What are you doing?

15:52.153 --> 15:53.921
Shut up and pay
attention to this.

15:55.290 --> 15:57.025
What's that got to
do with anything?

15:57.092 --> 15:58.860
This has got to do with a lot.

15:58.928 --> 16:00.929
See, 'cause we found this guy
dead this morning, okay?

16:00.997 --> 16:03.198
When we ran him through the
system, your name came up.

16:03.266 --> 16:04.633
What, you guys
had a little beef?

16:04.701 --> 16:05.834
Guy attacked me.

16:05.902 --> 16:07.402
Here we go! Got
something, Danny.

16:07.470 --> 16:09.404
Oh...

16:10.305 --> 16:11.706
We got a fresh catch.

16:11.773 --> 16:13.373
A fresh catch of crystal meth.

16:13.441 --> 16:15.542
And I think it's a
new-fangled fishing pole.

16:15.610 --> 16:16.543
That's not mine!

16:16.611 --> 16:18.278
"It's not mine!
It's not mine."

16:18.346 --> 16:21.314
Whose is it, then? What,
it just fell into your net?

16:21.382 --> 16:23.883
Listen. Don't you know
how these drug busts go?

16:23.951 --> 16:26.820
You give up the big fish-- and
you will give up the big fish--

16:26.887 --> 16:30.457
Oh, and--by the way--
your lawyer will 100 % tell you

16:30.524 --> 16:31.725
that that's the play.
The dealer comes after

16:31.792 --> 16:33.993
you, chops you up into
little pieces of poke

16:34.061 --> 16:36.429
and feeds you to the sand sharks.
Circle of life, babe.

16:36.497 --> 16:39.433
But if you want to talk with
us a little bit, cooperate,

16:39.500 --> 16:42.303
maybe we take these guys
down before they find you.

16:46.408 --> 16:48.309
Okay.

16:48.376 --> 16:50.010
Okay.
Okay.

16:50.078 --> 16:52.614
All right. Leung,
he wouldn't go along.

16:52.681 --> 16:53.715
Go along with what?

16:53.782 --> 16:54.949
What we had going here.

16:55.017 --> 16:56.651
You know, with the
economy in the crapper,

16:56.719 --> 16:58.654
you gotta kind of improvise
if you want to get paid.

16:58.721 --> 17:00.422
So you just pick up loads

17:00.490 --> 17:02.091
that just happen to fall
off container ships?

17:02.158 --> 17:03.358
Something like that.

17:03.426 --> 17:04.859
Okay, keep going.

17:04.928 --> 17:07.462
And these guys
we were dealing with,

17:07.529 --> 17:09.364
they didn't like that
Leung wasn't into it.

17:09.431 --> 17:11.799
So, they said
it was all or nothing,

17:11.867 --> 17:14.334
I had to get him in,
or else they were going to

17:14.402 --> 17:15.669
take their business
someplace else.

17:15.737 --> 17:17.270
So you had to get him--
so you shot him?

17:17.338 --> 17:18.972
No!

17:19.040 --> 17:20.373
No.

17:20.441 --> 17:22.942
Guy was a pain in the ass,
but I didn't kill him.

17:23.010 --> 17:26.012
So what'd you do? You talk it
through over tea and scones?

17:26.080 --> 17:26.146
I went and met with him.
Uh-huh.

17:27.582 --> 17:28.950
And I might've
brought a baseball bat,

17:29.017 --> 17:30.818
and he might've fell
on it a couple times,

17:30.886 --> 17:32.887
but that is all
you're going to put on me.

17:32.955 --> 17:34.289
So Leung finds out
about the drugs

17:34.357 --> 17:35.523
and threatens to
go to the police.

17:35.591 --> 17:37.759
No.

17:37.827 --> 17:39.695
He just didn't want
his kid involved.

17:41.732 --> 17:42.832
All right.

17:42.899 --> 17:45.201
We're going to run this gun.

17:45.268 --> 17:46.935
And we're going to find out

17:47.003 --> 17:48.537
if it matches the one
that killed Leung.

17:48.604 --> 17:49.971
And in the meantime...

17:50.039 --> 17:52.607
you and I are going to
take a little walk.

17:57.111 --> 17:58.912
Hi. I'm still waiting
to hear back from Ballistics

17:58.980 --> 18:00.180
on the gun we found
on Sal's boat,

18:00.247 --> 18:01.748
but without a slug,
it's gonna be tough.

18:01.815 --> 18:02.982
You think he did it?

18:03.050 --> 18:04.183
I don't know.
I don't know.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.386
I mean, his GPS
and his fuel logs

18:06.454 --> 18:07.654
put him 50 miles out to sea

18:07.722 --> 18:09.756
at the time of our
victim's death.

18:09.824 --> 18:11.258
But he has a chopper,
though, right?

18:11.326 --> 18:12.626
No, he does not have a chopper.

18:12.694 --> 18:14.996
The bank now has a chopper.
He lost it a month ago.

18:15.064 --> 18:17.499
You get anything off of
our victim Leung's computer?

18:17.566 --> 18:19.167
Oh, yeah. The browser
history shows

18:19.235 --> 18:21.369
an article on the
Jordan Rutherford case.

18:21.437 --> 18:23.705
Jordan Rutherford is...

18:23.773 --> 18:24.840
Okay, well...

18:24.908 --> 18:26.341
Two months ago,

18:26.409 --> 18:27.509
Jordan Rutherford was accused

18:27.577 --> 18:28.843
of strangling Vicki Hailama,

18:28.911 --> 18:31.079
a 19-year-old college girl
on spring break.

18:31.147 --> 18:33.181
Yes, I remember. HPD's still
looking for this guy.

18:33.249 --> 18:35.650
Jordan Rutherford disappeared
the day he became a suspect.

18:35.717 --> 18:37.284
It was just like he vanished
into thin air.

18:37.352 --> 18:38.552
No one's seen him since.

18:39.721 --> 18:42.288
<i>The parents of Vicki Hailama</i>

18:42.356 --> 18:45.058
<i>made a plea today for Jordan</i>
<i>Rutherford to turn himself in.</i>

18:45.125 --> 18:47.560
<i>Authorities have so far been</i>

18:47.628 --> 18:50.797
<i>unable to bring the murder</i>
<i>suspect to justice.</i>

18:50.864 --> 18:52.698
Okay. All right. So what's
the connection to Leung?

18:52.766 --> 18:53.699
This is the last thing he was

18:53.767 --> 18:54.767
looking at
the night he was killed.

18:54.835 --> 18:55.768
Maybe he couldn't sleep,

18:55.836 --> 18:56.903
and he was just surfing.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.204
Yeah, 'cause
that's entertaining.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.405
I mean, when I can't sleep,
I watch old hockey fights

18:59.473 --> 19:01.307
on YouTube. What's up?

19:01.375 --> 19:02.475
Those fish scales
you brought back

19:02.542 --> 19:03.642
that were inside
the gunshot wound?

19:03.710 --> 19:06.112
They came off
an Etelis Carbunculus.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.346
Locals call it Ehu.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.081
They're pretty rare
around here these days.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.016
In fact, according
to a fish dealer,

19:11.084 --> 19:12.651
only one load of them
was sold today.

19:12.719 --> 19:13.551
Okay. Who sold it?

19:13.619 --> 19:14.919
It came off of Leung's boat.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.821
Okay, good.

19:16.889 --> 19:17.822
So, this guy gets killed
on his own boat,

19:17.890 --> 19:19.657
and our number one suspect, Sal,

19:19.725 --> 19:22.159
is off catching tuna fish
at the time of death?

19:22.227 --> 19:23.660
Unless we have any evidence
that shows otherwise,

19:23.728 --> 19:26.163
and a search of Leung's
boat turned up nothing.

19:26.230 --> 19:27.164
Maybe not.

19:27.231 --> 19:28.832
Through the dealer,
I was able

19:28.900 --> 19:30.735
to track the fish to that
new restaurant, Morimoto.

19:30.802 --> 19:33.238
I was thinking that maybe our
killer left some evidence on it.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.807
On the fish? Really?
You're kidding.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.876
Hello?

19:39.645 --> 19:41.780
Yeah.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.883
Okay.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.451
Uncle said Auntie Mele's

19:45.519 --> 19:47.019
not going to make it
through the night.

19:47.087 --> 19:48.855
Okay.

19:50.090 --> 19:51.623
Bro, we got to go.
Go ahead.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.359
McGarrett's on his way back.
We'll go see about the fish.

19:53.427 --> 19:55.728
Go on.

20:29.664 --> 20:31.465
Kono.

20:31.532 --> 20:33.633
Uncle.

20:48.382 --> 20:52.385
Um, she's in the bedroom.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.354
She's heavily sedated, but...

20:57.090 --> 20:58.890
she'll be glad to see you.

21:21.317 --> 21:24.820
I'm so glad you came, Chin.

21:24.888 --> 21:26.888
It's good to
see you, Auntie.

21:29.225 --> 21:30.459
Kono?

21:30.527 --> 21:33.696
I'm here, Auntie.

21:35.966 --> 21:38.101
Promise me

21:38.169 --> 21:41.404
you'll look after Uncle
after I'm gone.

21:41.472 --> 21:43.073
I promise.

21:49.014 --> 21:51.749
I need to talk to you.

21:55.855 --> 21:57.857
I'll be right back, okay?

22:10.837 --> 22:12.704
It's up to you

22:12.772 --> 22:18.510
to make this thing between
Chin Ho and your Uncle right.

22:18.577 --> 22:19.878
This is in the past.

22:19.945 --> 22:21.779
You know, this is how
we discuss this.

22:21.847 --> 22:25.950
He won't even talk to me
about it.

22:26.018 --> 22:30.522
Everything was fine between them

22:30.590 --> 22:34.260
until I got sick...

22:34.327 --> 22:38.097
and then Chin was dismissed

22:38.165 --> 22:39.933
from the Force.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.437
Do you think those two things
are related?

22:43.504 --> 22:47.541
I'm afraid to ask.

22:47.608 --> 22:49.209
I will help you
through this again.

22:49.276 --> 22:50.443
I made up my mind!

22:50.511 --> 22:52.879
Why would you want to
take it on for yourself?

22:52.947 --> 22:55.548
'Cause I knew. Truth out,
and you'll help me.

22:59.620 --> 23:01.387
Yo!

23:01.455 --> 23:04.123
Right here, boss!

23:04.191 --> 23:04.257
Where's the wheelchair
and the cute nurse?

23:05.592 --> 23:06.726
Fine.

23:08.262 --> 23:10.063
What's all this?

23:10.131 --> 23:11.398
Sorry, brah.

23:11.466 --> 23:13.401
Big sale on ice.

23:13.468 --> 23:16.004
They had a sale on ice.
Mean sale.

23:16.071 --> 23:19.074
Uh-huh. I'm sure glad
you stopped for ice.

23:25.114 --> 23:27.783
<i>Mahaloes for picking me up.</i>

23:27.850 --> 23:29.451
<i>Shoots.</i>

23:29.519 --> 23:31.520
♪ ♪

23:40.764 --> 23:41.930
Auntie knows.

23:45.535 --> 23:47.436
Knows what?

23:47.503 --> 23:49.705
That this thing between
you and Uncle has

23:49.772 --> 23:52.340
something to do with
you being kicked off the Force.

23:52.408 --> 23:55.110
Is that what you two spent
your time talking about?

23:55.178 --> 23:57.946
Look, I heard you two
arguing about money.

23:58.014 --> 23:59.648
Yeah, well,
you heard wrong.

23:59.716 --> 24:02.951
It was nothing.

24:03.019 --> 24:04.820
I'm thinking it was Uncle
who took

24:04.888 --> 24:06.455
the money from the Asset
Forfeiture Locker,

24:06.523 --> 24:08.024
and you're the one

24:08.092 --> 24:10.593
who took the fall, but what I
haven't figure out yet is why.

24:10.661 --> 24:12.863
You know what, Kono?
Just drop it, okay?

24:16.535 --> 24:18.970
Look, don't lie
to me, Chin!

24:19.038 --> 24:20.038
Not now!

24:20.106 --> 24:21.506
Am I right
or am I not?!

24:29.082 --> 24:32.318
Okay.

24:32.385 --> 24:34.486
Auntie got sick
and needed a kidney.

24:34.554 --> 24:37.456
But you know how hard it is
to get on the donor list

24:37.524 --> 24:39.491
for a transplant here
in the islands, right?

24:39.559 --> 24:40.993
Yeah, but she got a kidney.

24:41.060 --> 24:44.430
She did, but she didn't get it
the way that Uncle said.

24:46.266 --> 24:49.735
Auntie would have died
waiting on that list.

24:49.803 --> 24:51.971
But Uncle knew
some people in China

24:52.039 --> 24:53.906
who could get her one
on the black market.

24:53.974 --> 24:57.310
The thing is, nobody in our
family has that kind of money.

24:57.377 --> 24:59.412
Did you know
he was going to take it?

24:59.480 --> 25:05.618
No. Uncle did what he had to do.

25:08.121 --> 25:10.390
You could have said something.

25:10.457 --> 25:12.325
Why did you take the fall?

25:12.392 --> 25:15.028
You lost your badge.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.729
What was I supposed to do?

25:16.797 --> 25:20.533
Tell IA what really happened
and watch Uncle go to jail?

25:22.769 --> 25:24.737
You're a cop.

25:24.804 --> 25:27.439
You're supposed
to tell the truth.

25:27.507 --> 25:29.274
Sometimes things aren't
so simple, Kono.

25:31.310 --> 25:32.543
I promised Uncle

25:32.611 --> 25:36.780
that Auntie would be shielded
from all of this.

25:36.848 --> 25:38.181
I kept my promise.

25:40.484 --> 25:44.453
When Auntie passes,
you're gonna tell the truth.

25:44.521 --> 25:46.655
That's what Uncle
wants, isn't it?

25:46.723 --> 25:48.657
Yeah, but what good
is it gonna do?

25:51.595 --> 25:57.733
I finally found a home
here with 5-O, Kono.

25:57.801 --> 26:01.604
Whatever happened, happened.

26:15.397 --> 26:18.399
♪ ♪

26:20.836 --> 26:22.937
Where's the chef?

26:26.275 --> 26:28.342
♪ ♪

26:30.979 --> 26:33.548
Stop the music, please.

26:33.615 --> 26:35.016
Yeah. Steve McGarrett.
Hi, Steve.

26:35.084 --> 26:36.652
This is Detective
Danny Williams. Five-O.
Hi.

26:36.719 --> 26:38.420
I'm just testing my
new karaoke machine.

26:38.488 --> 26:40.389
Oh.
Had it flown over from Japan.

26:40.457 --> 26:41.523
It's special.
It's nice.

26:41.591 --> 26:43.225
You like karaoke?
Yes, I do.

26:43.293 --> 26:44.593
You have a lovely voice.

26:44.661 --> 26:46.328
I don't know.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.330
Uh, we-we spoke to
your fish dealer this morning.

26:48.398 --> 26:51.533
Yes?
And he said that
you purchased, well, fish.

26:51.601 --> 26:54.035
Ehu.
Yes, yes. Ehu, yes.
Can we see the catch?

26:54.103 --> 26:55.871
Yes, I take you.
Thank you. <i>Arigoto.</i>

26:57.506 --> 26:59.007
Here you are.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.909
This is mine--
of today.

27:00.977 --> 27:03.445
Hey, buddy,
after you.

27:03.513 --> 27:06.249
It's all you, babe.
I can't get my cast wet.

27:06.316 --> 27:08.317
That's low.

27:09.687 --> 27:11.254
That's really low.

27:11.322 --> 27:13.423
What exactly are
we looking for?

27:13.491 --> 27:15.459
We'll know when we find it,
so be thorough.

27:15.526 --> 27:16.960
Oh, be thorough. Okay.

27:17.028 --> 27:18.306
Yeah, be thorough.
Check every fish, Danny

27:18.307 --> 27:19.657
Oh, okay.
All the fish in the box.

27:19.665 --> 27:21.232
You're going to pay for this,

27:21.300 --> 27:22.900
100 %.

27:25.270 --> 27:26.703
Looks like a fish.

27:26.771 --> 27:27.437
Beautiful.

27:27.505 --> 27:29.806
Okay.

27:29.874 --> 27:32.308
When you know it.
Another big, red fish.

27:32.376 --> 27:33.743
Huh?

27:33.811 --> 27:35.178
Nice size.

27:35.245 --> 27:37.146
Nice size, yeah.

27:37.214 --> 27:40.149
We got a fish, we
got another fish.

27:41.017 --> 27:43.218
Look at this fish.

27:43.286 --> 27:47.190
This is a special fish, huh?

27:50.161 --> 27:51.629
That's a bullet hole.

27:51.697 --> 27:53.798
Yeah. You see, either

27:53.866 --> 27:56.501
they got an interesting
new way to catch fish,

27:56.569 --> 27:59.105
or we just found our
ballistics evidence.

28:14.021 --> 28:16.089
Mushroomed.
Small caliber.

28:16.157 --> 28:17.490
I bet it went
into the fish

28:17.558 --> 28:18.691
after it went
through our victim.

28:18.759 --> 28:19.926
I'll get it to the lab.

28:21.496 --> 28:22.429
Hey.

28:22.497 --> 28:23.764
<i>Arigato.</i>
Okay.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.332
Hey!

28:28.737 --> 28:30.037
Hey, boss,
how is it?

28:30.105 --> 28:31.940
Good to have you
back in one piece.

28:32.007 --> 28:34.309
Well, Kono, it's good
to be back in one piece.

28:34.377 --> 28:36.545
Phew! What's that smell?

28:36.613 --> 28:37.980
Oh, that's the sashimi special.
Mm.

28:38.047 --> 28:40.516
Yeah. Danny went home
to change his shirt.

28:40.583 --> 28:42.117
I heard you guys lucked
out at Morimoto's.

28:42.185 --> 28:44.686
We did. Uh, we recovered
a fired round from a .38.

28:44.754 --> 28:46.321
The same caliber
as Sal Groves' gun.

28:46.388 --> 28:48.623
Ballistics is running it
through now. What do you got?

28:48.690 --> 28:49.657
All right, the lab
just sent this over.

28:49.724 --> 28:51.091
They found traces

28:51.159 --> 28:52.559
of jet fuel
on our vic's shoes,

28:52.627 --> 28:53.827
clothing and skin.

28:53.895 --> 28:55.562
Jet fuel. Okay,
he could have come

28:55.630 --> 28:57.697
into contact with that
when his body was dumped.

28:57.765 --> 29:00.066
Yeah, but, uh, the skin
absorption rate suggests

29:00.134 --> 29:02.902
that Leung came into contact
with it hours before his death.

29:04.639 --> 29:07.507
Oh. Hey, wait a minute.

29:07.575 --> 29:10.310
Why is a fish boat captain
handling jet fuel anyway?

29:10.378 --> 29:11.879
Yeah, it's not
just any jet fuel.

29:11.946 --> 29:13.313
This stuff is
a new biofuel.

29:13.381 --> 29:15.449
There's only one airstrip
on the island that uses it.

29:15.517 --> 29:16.918
And the lab
traced it back to

29:16.986 --> 29:18.786
High Blue Jet Charters.

29:18.854 --> 29:21.356
The Web site says
they fly everywhere.

29:21.424 --> 29:23.525
Even over remote locations
where you can dump a body?

29:23.592 --> 29:25.193
Even over those.
Right.

29:30.098 --> 29:32.032
<i>Yeah, I recognize him.</i>

29:32.100 --> 29:34.101
It's, uh, Jack Leung.

29:34.168 --> 29:36.403
Worked the graveyard shift,
refueling, routine maintenance.

29:36.470 --> 29:37.671
Wait a minute.
He worked here?

29:37.738 --> 29:40.273
Yeah. Said he wanted
to pick up some extra money.

29:40.341 --> 29:41.574
Hard worker.

29:41.642 --> 29:43.976
Always talking about his son,
their fishing boat.

29:44.044 --> 29:45.778
Said times were tough
on the docks.

29:45.846 --> 29:47.513
Okay, did he
work last night?

29:47.581 --> 29:49.949
Yeah, sure did.
It's our busy season.

29:50.017 --> 29:52.985
Something wrong?

29:55.121 --> 29:56.288
Yeah, something's wrong.

29:56.356 --> 29:57.590
We found his body

29:57.657 --> 29:58.958
in the jungle
this morning.

29:59.026 --> 30:00.460
Huh.
So, we know

30:00.528 --> 30:02.729
that he came in contact
with a special kind of jet fuel

30:02.796 --> 30:04.764
several hours
before his death.

30:04.832 --> 30:07.133
Like I said, he was our main
gas-and-go guy last night.

30:07.201 --> 30:09.636
Okay. Did anything out of
the ordinary happen last night?

30:09.704 --> 30:12.807
Yeah, he wanted to use
the computer in the office.

30:12.874 --> 30:13.974
What for?

30:14.042 --> 30:15.342
Something about
a flight manifest.

30:15.410 --> 30:17.746
Why would he want
to see a flight manifest?

30:17.813 --> 30:19.681
Sometimes the guys--
they get curious

30:19.749 --> 30:21.482
about the folks using the strip.

30:21.550 --> 30:23.317
Just last week,
Warren Buffett comes through.

30:23.385 --> 30:24.852
But you know, the ground crew--

30:24.920 --> 30:26.754
they're more interested
in rock stars, athletes.

30:26.822 --> 30:28.622
Do you remember the plane
by any chance?

30:28.690 --> 30:32.492
No, but we didn't have any VIPs
come through last night.

30:32.560 --> 30:33.927
All right, can we take a look
at his locker?

30:33.994 --> 30:35.962
Yeah, it's just inside,
to the left.

30:36.029 --> 30:39.098
Look what I found--
flight manifest.

30:41.067 --> 30:42.601
That he wasn't supposed to have.

30:42.669 --> 30:47.140
Okay, the jet is owned
by a Lotus Leaf Holding Company.

30:47.207 --> 30:49.108
One-way charter to Hong Kong.

30:49.176 --> 30:51.211
One passenger,
and there's no name.

30:51.279 --> 30:52.546
It had to be important.

30:52.614 --> 30:54.348
I mean, went through
all the trouble of stealing it.

30:54.416 --> 30:56.017
All right,
Leung goes fishing, okay?

30:56.084 --> 30:58.453
Then he comes,
he works the nightshift here,

30:58.521 --> 30:59.721
and he sees something.

30:59.789 --> 31:01.690
Then he comes home, and
he gets killed on his own boat.

31:01.758 --> 31:04.793
Question is, what did he see
that got him killed?

31:04.861 --> 31:07.496
Lotus Leaf Holding Company--
several companies

31:07.563 --> 31:08.930
folded into one.

31:08.998 --> 31:10.232
Looks like an
import outfit.

31:10.299 --> 31:12.033
Real estate
holdings, as well.

31:12.101 --> 31:13.969
Okay, uh, bring up
the incorporation paperwork

31:14.037 --> 31:15.437
and find me a primary.

31:16.806 --> 31:18.574
Donald Rutherford.

31:18.641 --> 31:19.741
Wait a minute.

31:19.809 --> 31:21.043
You think he's any relation

31:21.111 --> 31:22.678
to Jordan Rutherford,
the Spring Break Strangler?

31:22.746 --> 31:24.480
He's his father.
Okay.

31:24.548 --> 31:25.748
Wasn't Leung looking up

31:25.816 --> 31:27.250
the Rutherford case
right before he was murdered?

31:27.317 --> 31:28.417
Yeah, he was.

31:28.485 --> 31:29.619
He was, right?
Yeah.

31:29.686 --> 31:30.987
Ballistics just got
a hit on that .38

31:31.055 --> 31:32.422
you pulled out of the fish.

31:32.489 --> 31:34.090
It wasn't from Sal Groves' gun,
but

31:34.158 --> 31:36.159
they did get a hit.
The slug came

31:36.227 --> 31:38.161
from a gun sold
at Ace Gun & Rifle.

31:38.229 --> 31:39.597
The owner's an ex-cop
who registers

31:39.664 --> 31:41.165
a ballistics profile
of every gun that he sells.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.833
Guess who the buyer was.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.934
Donald Rutherford.
Yeah.

31:45.002 --> 31:46.235
But why would he
want to kill Leung?

31:46.303 --> 31:47.403
I think I know why.

31:47.471 --> 31:48.571
The flight manifest

31:48.639 --> 31:49.805
that we pulled out
of Leung's locker--

31:49.873 --> 31:51.140
it said, one
passenger, right?

31:51.207 --> 31:53.208
Yeah, but that couldn't have
been Donald Rutherford.

31:53.276 --> 31:55.210
That flight took off hours
before Leung was killed.

31:55.277 --> 31:56.744
Yeah, that's because it wasn't
Donald Rutherford on that plane.

31:56.812 --> 31:57.978
It was Jordan Rutherford.

31:59.180 --> 32:00.547
Right.

32:00.615 --> 32:03.250
So Leung witnessed Donald
Rutherford helping his son

32:03.317 --> 32:05.052
escape from the island.
Exactly.

32:05.119 --> 32:06.420
Okay, Daddy wants
to keep the secret,

32:06.487 --> 32:08.021
so he follows Leung
back to the boat,

32:08.089 --> 32:10.190
he kills him, secret safe.

32:10.258 --> 32:11.358
Not anymore.

32:11.426 --> 32:12.425
Not anymore.

32:32.972 --> 32:36.241
Can I help you?

32:36.309 --> 32:38.978
Mr. Rutherford,
Steve McGarrett from Five-O.

32:39.045 --> 32:40.446
We'd like a word.

32:40.514 --> 32:41.647
I'll be right down.

32:41.715 --> 32:42.982
Okay.

32:50.858 --> 32:53.159
You think he's running?

32:53.227 --> 32:54.894
Yeah, I do.

33:02.370 --> 33:03.537
Donald Rutherford?

33:05.941 --> 33:08.442
Donald Rutherford?

33:14.484 --> 33:15.751
Go.

33:21.058 --> 33:23.092
This door's locked.
Okay.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.494
The window's are all shut.
He's still in here.

33:25.562 --> 33:27.363
All right, I'm
gonna call a K-9 unit.

33:27.430 --> 33:29.465
No, no, wait. I've
got a better idea.

33:29.532 --> 33:30.799
Just wait here.

33:49.484 --> 33:51.986
Come on, come on,
where are you?

34:03.498 --> 34:06.032
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

34:06.100 --> 34:08.067
He's in the floor.

34:08.135 --> 34:10.101
The son of a bitch
is in the floor.

34:38.366 --> 34:39.466
Donald Rutherford,

34:39.534 --> 34:42.203
put the gun down right now.

34:43.672 --> 34:45.304
I'm not gonna do that.

34:47.475 --> 34:49.176
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hey.

34:49.243 --> 34:50.344
You know why we're here?

34:50.411 --> 34:52.780
I'm not a stupid man.
- Okay,

34:52.847 --> 34:54.848
you were trying
to protect your son.

34:54.916 --> 34:56.750
Okay, I get that.
You don't get anything.

34:56.818 --> 34:59.220
You have no idea what it's like

34:59.287 --> 35:01.189
to see your boy's name
dragged through the papers...

35:01.256 --> 35:02.790
hunted.
Let me ask you a question.

35:02.858 --> 35:04.492
How long you think
you were gonna hide him

35:04.559 --> 35:05.826
down here, huh?

35:05.894 --> 35:09.764
You were just doing what any
good father would do, all right?

35:09.831 --> 35:12.433
Okay... okay,

35:12.501 --> 35:13.634
you see this?

35:13.701 --> 35:15.369
I'm gonna put
my weapon away, okay?

35:15.437 --> 35:17.005
Don't shoot me, now.

35:17.072 --> 35:19.841
You shoot me, he's gonna shoot
you, and it'll be a big mess.

35:21.511 --> 35:25.114
The guy you shot, his
name was Jack Leung.

35:25.215 --> 35:27.049
Hey. Leung,

35:27.117 --> 35:29.819
he took that other job so that
he could take care of <i>his</i> son.

35:29.887 --> 35:30.987
What happened,
did Jack

35:31.054 --> 35:32.555
catch you trying
to smuggle your son

35:32.623 --> 35:34.390
out of the country,
is that what happened?

35:34.458 --> 35:36.259
He knew.

35:36.326 --> 35:39.495
After weeks of hiding my son
and trying to get him out,

35:39.563 --> 35:43.065
I wasn't gonna let
that man mess things up.

35:43.133 --> 35:44.733
Jordan's all I have.

He's not some monster.

35:46.403 --> 35:49.272
Well... he killed
that girl.

35:49.339 --> 35:51.307
Her name was
Vicki Hailama.

35:51.375 --> 35:53.876
He made a mistake,
a stupid mistake--

35:53.944 --> 35:55.844
and he should pay
with his whole life?

35:55.912 --> 35:57.012
"Stupid mistake"?

35:57.080 --> 35:59.047
No, he strangled
that girl.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.148
He strangled her because she

36:00.216 --> 36:01.417
wouldn't go up
to his hotel room,

36:01.484 --> 36:03.753
and then he dumped
her body in the ocean.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.721
It's not a stupid mistake--
that's what your son did.

36:05.789 --> 36:06.822
Well, he's safe now.

36:06.890 --> 36:08.891
And if you think

36:08.959 --> 36:10.259
I'm gonna tell you

36:10.327 --> 36:12.295
where he is, you're
wrong-- dead wrong.

36:13.563 --> 36:15.732
This your son?

Don't you touch that.

36:35.019 --> 36:37.253
He was doing it to help

36:37.321 --> 36:39.256
He never said anything.

36:39.323 --> 36:41.057
I knew he wanted me
