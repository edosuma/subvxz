WEBVTT

00:13.995 --> 00:15.986
Twenty-nine, what is your 20?

00:16.164 --> 00:17.757
In pursuit of a failure to yield.

00:17.932 --> 00:19.627
Vehicle's a red Ferrari
headed eastbound

00:19.801 --> 00:21.769
toward the 4th Street Bridge.

00:47.629 --> 00:49.324
It's confirmed, but it's getting late.

01:08.750 --> 01:11.048
A valiant effort, sir.

02:04.672 --> 02:06.333
Good morning, Mr. Deeks.

02:06.507 --> 02:07.736
Morning, Hetty.

02:07.909 --> 02:09.673
Are you here to return to the field?

02:10.777 --> 02:14.180
Or clear out your desk
before your colleagues arrive?

02:15.383 --> 02:17.852
I don't know. I, um...

02:18.152 --> 02:22.111
I got up and I drove in.

02:23.391 --> 02:25.519
Figured I'd know what to do
when I got here.

02:26.060 --> 02:27.084
And?

02:28.863 --> 02:30.422
Ask me tomorrow.

02:31.966 --> 02:33.127
I shall.

02:43.578 --> 02:47.708
Just, uh, out of curiosity,
how did you know I was coming back?

02:49.717 --> 02:51.913
Ask me tomorrow.

02:55.089 --> 02:56.784
Touché.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.047
I'm 6'3", 225.

03:21.215 --> 03:23.547
- That is big.
- It's not big.

03:23.718 --> 03:25.638
You know, it's above average,
I'll give you that.

03:25.787 --> 03:27.881
But I'm not, like,
some oversized behemoth.

03:28.056 --> 03:30.855
- I got good proportions, G.
- What is this all about?

03:31.259 --> 03:33.419
The other night, my family
was watching Project Runway,

03:33.561 --> 03:36.121
and all of a sudden, it became
funny time in the Hanna household.

03:36.264 --> 03:37.984
Started talking
about how I need a makeover.

03:39.434 --> 03:42.495
Don't start. When I find something
that works, I stick with it.

03:42.670 --> 03:45.037
I hear you.
Our lives are dangerous enough

03:45.206 --> 03:47.732
- without taking any fashion risks.
- I tried to mix it up.

03:47.909 --> 03:50.037
I went over to Robertson
to pick up some jeans.

03:50.545 --> 03:52.138
You bought clothes on Robertson?

03:52.313 --> 03:54.008
No. You know why?

03:54.716 --> 03:57.413
Because they don't carry clothes
for "men my size."

03:57.585 --> 03:58.825
That's what the guy said to me.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.350
Wow. And he's still alive?

04:02.023 --> 04:04.993
When did grown men
start wearing skinny jeans? Hmm?

04:05.159 --> 04:07.150
Could you picture me
in a pair of skinny jeans?

04:07.328 --> 04:09.353
I couldn't fit my arm
in a pair of skinny jeans.

04:09.530 --> 04:11.191
You wore huskies as a kid,
didn't you?

04:12.867 --> 04:14.198
Why do I talk to you, man?

04:15.436 --> 04:17.870
Because even a man your size
needs a friend.

04:22.076 --> 04:23.805
Come on.

04:44.832 --> 04:46.926
New Smith & Wesson?

04:48.603 --> 04:49.661
New gun.

04:49.837 --> 04:51.965
Same manual safety.

04:52.140 --> 04:55.906
It's helpful if a junky tries
to snatch it from you.

04:58.980 --> 05:00.675
Someone once told me that.

05:02.784 --> 05:05.651
- So you're here to...?
- Work.

05:06.621 --> 05:07.884
I'm here to work.

05:09.056 --> 05:10.217
You back?

05:11.559 --> 05:13.755
I'm gonna take it one day at a time.

05:16.531 --> 05:17.555
Cool.

05:20.301 --> 05:22.292
This is your automated call to Ops.

05:22.470 --> 05:24.598
Please proceed
to the Operations Center immediately

05:24.772 --> 05:25.796
for further instructions.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.072
- Really?
- That would be Eric 1.0.

05:29.243 --> 05:30.608
2.0 would be a hologram.

05:35.116 --> 05:36.880
Let's go, partner.

05:39.887 --> 05:43.915
So if, uh, Eric 2.0 is a hologram,
what is Eric 3.07.

05:44.091 --> 05:45.718
At that point, he's just Nell.

05:45.893 --> 05:47.418
Well, well.

05:47.595 --> 05:49.393
I knew it was too good to be true.

06:03.444 --> 06:05.742
- Let's go.
- Shall we?

06:22.430 --> 06:25.730
Last night. Downtown.

06:27.702 --> 06:30.262
After he evaded the cops,
a security cam caught this.

06:31.839 --> 06:33.398
Ouch.

06:34.809 --> 06:37.506
Ferrari's a mid-engine.
I'm betting that's where the bomb was.

06:37.678 --> 06:41.546
Victim was Tom Norris,
CEO of Norris Bio Tech, local firm.

06:41.716 --> 06:45.311
Norris? When Tony Stark grows up,
he wants to be Tom Norris.

06:45.486 --> 06:47.726
This guy throws the sickest
4th of July party every year.

06:47.889 --> 06:50.329
Oh, the one where the girls wear
red, white and blue lingerie?

06:50.491 --> 06:52.651
It's beautiful.
It's actually quite a patriotic soirée.

06:52.793 --> 06:55.262
I thought that party was VIPs only.

06:55.429 --> 06:58.589
No, I... Not that I'd been, but if I had
been, which I'm not saying that I have,

06:58.699 --> 07:01.862
it's only because the security guards
are very pro-L.A.P.D.

07:02.036 --> 07:03.956
Which means he probably used
his badge to get in.

07:04.105 --> 07:07.131
Of course, I wouldn't do that.
That's against L.A.P.D. regulations.

07:07.308 --> 07:09.970
Anyway, I bet this playboy Norris left

07:10.144 --> 07:12.203
a lot of actresses and models
in his wake.

07:12.380 --> 07:14.849
This bomb doesn't exactly fit
the supermodel MO.

07:15.016 --> 07:17.178
But husbands of models,
that's a different story.

07:17.351 --> 07:19.191
They say that husbands of models
are the worst.

07:19.353 --> 07:21.033
They say. I don't say that.
People told me.

07:21.188 --> 07:23.088
- I'm gonna stop talking.
- Okay.

07:23.257 --> 07:24.937
Hetty's still on
with the State Department,

07:25.092 --> 07:26.287
but the headline is,

07:26.460 --> 07:29.452
Norris Bio Tech was working
on a highly classified ricin vaccine.

07:29.630 --> 07:31.655
Currently, no vaccine exists
for the toxin.

07:31.832 --> 07:34.995
And so far, ricin attacks
have been limited in size and scope.

07:35.169 --> 07:38.195
But if a ricin vaccine got into the hands
of a well-funded group,

07:38.372 --> 07:40.212
they could vaccinate
highly skilled operatives.

07:40.374 --> 07:43.105
A terrorist group.
Instead of using radicalized zealots

07:43.277 --> 07:45.644
willing to die for a cause,
they could use pros.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.180
We need to find out if this vaccine
project was compromised.

07:48.349 --> 07:50.875
Head over to Norris Bio Tech,
see what he was working on?

07:51.052 --> 07:54.317
- Yeah, you got it.
- Let's go see the Ferrari.

07:54.488 --> 07:56.456
I'll meet you at the car.

08:05.032 --> 08:06.932
Mr. Callen.

08:08.869 --> 08:10.789
Did you know Deeks
was coming back to work today?

08:11.372 --> 08:13.739
No. Mm-mm.

08:14.475 --> 08:16.807
Do you think he's ready
for the field?

08:18.646 --> 08:23.379
I don't know if Mr. Deeks himself
knows the answer to that question.

08:24.619 --> 08:30.683
But your concerns are duly noted,
Mr. Callen.

08:32.226 --> 08:33.455
Anything else?

08:36.297 --> 08:37.731
I guess we'll see.

08:42.336 --> 08:44.327
Car wasn't stock.

08:44.939 --> 08:49.137
Turbo conversion,
suspension upgrade.

08:49.710 --> 08:52.680
Nothing paid for with tax dollars
was gonna chase this thing down.

08:53.948 --> 08:55.507
Got the trigger.

08:56.450 --> 08:58.646
Mounted to the engine block
with a temperature gauge.

08:59.420 --> 09:02.117
Car reaches a certain temp,
flips the switch, boom.

09:02.289 --> 09:04.417
L.A.P.D. said that the chase
was six miles long.

09:04.592 --> 09:06.712
That trigger must have been set
at a high temperature.

09:06.861 --> 09:08.022
Yeah, smart.

09:08.195 --> 09:10.075
You might let someone drive
your custom Ferrari.

09:10.231 --> 09:12.097
Not me. Car like this?

09:12.266 --> 09:15.099
- I'm saying if you were to let me.
- You're not driving my Ferrari.

09:15.269 --> 09:17.135
- You don't have a Ferrari.
- It's your game.

09:17.304 --> 09:20.797
Okay. If my friend, not you,
were to let me drive their Ferrari...

09:20.975 --> 09:22.136
Your friend's not very smart.

09:22.309 --> 09:24.641
Yeah, they wouldn't let me redline it
through downtown.

09:24.812 --> 09:26.974
The only person
that would push the car to extremes

09:27.148 --> 09:29.207
and drive the engine temp up that high
is the owner.

09:30.184 --> 09:33.882
So the trigger ensured
that Norris would be the one killed.

09:34.055 --> 09:37.025
The trigger isn't the most
interesting thing about the bomb.

09:37.191 --> 09:40.559
Detective
Carpenter, you have a delivery.

09:40.728 --> 09:42.287
Detective Carpenter.

09:43.998 --> 09:45.727
White phosphorus.

09:46.033 --> 09:47.626
Burns long and hot.

09:47.802 --> 09:48.860
Worse than napalm.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.177
Most militaries banned its use.

09:52.506 --> 09:55.168
So, what's it doing in a car bomb
in Los Angeles?

10:07.086 --> 10:09.054
You don't just buy
white phosphorus.

10:09.222 --> 10:11.748
/t's always
accounted for and under lock and key.

10:11.925 --> 10:13.586
But two months ago,
the Serbs slated

10:13.760 --> 10:15.524
for a large amount of it
to be destroyed.

10:15.995 --> 10:18.965
Now, the white phosphorus
was in old ammunition shells

10:19.132 --> 10:20.372
left over from the Bosnian war,

10:20.533 --> 10:23.935
but the entire shipment was stolen
during transport.

10:24.103 --> 10:25.867
- Professional job?
- Yup.

10:26.039 --> 10:28.633
A precision team,
they took down the transport caravan.

10:28.808 --> 10:30.071
- Any leads?
- I'll know more

10:30.243 --> 10:33.076
- once I can connect with Interpol.
- All right, thanks, Nell.

10:33.246 --> 10:35.874
White phosphorus in a car bomb
is one thing.

10:36.049 --> 10:38.409
If an entire shipment of this stuff
is out on the streets...

10:38.551 --> 10:40.519
We got to find this bomber.

10:43.690 --> 10:45.158
You surf around here, right?

10:45.325 --> 10:48.784
Sure do. Staircase, Heavens, County.
This is my trifecta.

10:48.962 --> 10:50.430
So why don't you pick
the lunch spot?

10:50.596 --> 10:52.196
What?
You never let me pick where we eat.

10:52.365 --> 10:55.130
I know, but I'm making a gesture.
Welcome back to work gesture.

10:55.301 --> 10:58.236
Done. All right, Neptune's Net.
Best clam chowder on the west side.

10:58.404 --> 11:01.203
Good idea.
Ease your way into solid food.

11:01.374 --> 11:03.843
Wow, did that just happen?
Did you just make a torture joke?

11:04.010 --> 11:07.275
- I'm sorry. Was that too soon?
- No, no, that actually may be too late.

11:07.447 --> 11:09.677
What? Oh, come on.
You haven't been here.

11:09.849 --> 11:12.841
- It's been building up.
- All right, you know what? Fire away.

11:13.019 --> 11:14.379
No idea what you're talking about.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.120
Get it out of your system.
Let's hear it.

11:18.358 --> 11:20.986
Do your new teeth have satellite radio
or just terrestrial?

11:21.160 --> 11:23.240
Think a surfboard company
makes a leash for your gun?

11:23.396 --> 11:27.299
Would you have screamed louder
had they cut your bangs?

11:29.369 --> 11:31.963
- You done?
- Nowhere near, but it feels good.

11:32.138 --> 11:34.129
- Yeah.
- I missed you.

11:34.607 --> 11:37.269
- Sorry, what?
- I mean, I...

11:37.844 --> 11:39.403
I missed having someone
to beat up on,

11:39.579 --> 11:41.809
because Callen and Sam,
they're just...

11:41.981 --> 11:44.006
- They don't get my humor.
- You're still talking.

11:44.183 --> 11:46.618
Whatever. You know what I mean.

11:48.788 --> 11:50.347
I do.

11:54.694 --> 11:56.628
Ever hear of a group called Omni?

11:57.230 --> 11:59.665
It's a transnational
criminal organization.

11:59.832 --> 12:01.766
- Multiethnic.
- It's like an all-star team.

12:01.934 --> 12:04.631
It's got senior members
from various Eurasian criminal groups.

12:04.804 --> 12:06.898
All-stars with white phosphorus.

12:07.073 --> 12:08.598
Interpol recovered some of it

12:08.775 --> 12:11.039
when they busted a group
of Omni members

12:11.210 --> 12:12.735
in an undercover sting.

12:12.912 --> 12:14.952
- The rest of the shipment?
- Still unaccounted for.

12:15.081 --> 12:16.881
So Omni either planted the bomb
to kill Norris

12:17.016 --> 12:20.145
or they supplied the white phosphorus
to the person who did.

12:20.887 --> 12:22.967
Test samples are stored
in a secure vault in the lab.

12:23.122 --> 12:24.602
Only the ricin vaccine team
can enter.

12:24.757 --> 12:26.637
We're gonna need access
to surveillance systems.

12:26.793 --> 12:29.091
- And all of Mr. Norris' computers.
- Of course.

12:29.262 --> 12:32.357
Mr. Paulson,
how long did you know Tom Norris?

12:32.532 --> 12:35.297
Norris Bio Tech was the third venture
Tom and I worked on.

12:35.468 --> 12:38.597
- He was a visionary.
- Hmph. That's a strong word.

12:38.771 --> 12:41.103
Do you know anyone
who would wanna harm Mr. Norris?

12:41.274 --> 12:42.639
- You mean blow him up?
- Yes.

12:42.809 --> 12:44.402
No, no, he wasn't the kind of guy

12:44.577 --> 12:46.017
who went through life
making enemies.

12:46.112 --> 12:48.706
- People loved him.
- Except Rawlings.

12:48.881 --> 12:50.508
- Who's Rawlings?
- Todd Rawlings.

12:50.683 --> 12:52.412
He was at Norris' last company.

12:52.585 --> 12:56.249
Dr. Rawlings filed a patent lawsuit
against Tom a few years back.

12:56.422 --> 12:58.413
It was a baseless claim,
and we defended it.

12:59.058 --> 13:01.288
Rawlings went broke
trying to keep that suit going.

13:01.461 --> 13:04.522
Well, did it ever go beyond the courts,
or did he ever threaten Mr. Norris?

13:05.331 --> 13:08.062
He said some awful things,
but Tom never took him seriously.

13:08.568 --> 13:09.648
Well, maybe he should have.

13:09.802 --> 13:12.703
Dr. Leonard, how long
were you working with Mr. Norris?

13:13.039 --> 13:17.476
Uh, from 2011
until roughly six hours ago.

13:17.643 --> 13:20.578
He hired me
to create the ricin vaccine.

13:20.746 --> 13:24.307
Dr. Leonard believes it's viable.
We're gonna start clinical trials soon.

13:24.484 --> 13:26.782
- It is viable.
- Is that information public?

13:26.953 --> 13:28.887
No. Just key executives

13:29.055 --> 13:31.717
and doctors on the research team
know about the specific progress.

13:31.891 --> 13:33.985
Okay. We're gonna need a list
of all those people.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.186
- Of course.
- Um, agent people, if we're done here,

13:37.363 --> 13:38.558
I have work to do.

13:43.336 --> 13:45.376
Something's off about Dr. Leonard.
I don't like him.

13:45.538 --> 13:47.267
Well, genius is often misunderstood.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.635
Yeah? How would you know?

13:48.808 --> 13:51.368
Maybe... Maybe he's just
really socially awkward.

13:51.544 --> 13:55.174
Or maybe...
Maybe he's hiding something.

13:56.382 --> 13:57.941
Well, no dice on Dr. Rawlings.

13:58.117 --> 14:01.109
After losing the lawsuit to Norris,
he gave up on Bio Tech.

14:01.287 --> 14:04.086
The guy's been giving scuba lessons
in the Keys for two years.

14:04.257 --> 14:06.487
Did you find anything
on Norris' computers?

14:06.659 --> 14:08.149
I just started looking into them.

14:08.728 --> 14:09.768
Seems that he was a member

14:09.929 --> 14:12.728
- of the Angeles Ridge Racing Club.
- It's a members-only racetrack.

14:12.899 --> 14:14.890
That would explain
the modifications to his car.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.695
Norris kept a garage at the track
where he stored the Ferrari.

14:17.870 --> 14:19.830
And a private garage is a good place
to rig a bomb

14:19.972 --> 14:21.030
where no one's watching.

14:21.207 --> 14:23.699
- I'll get started on a warrant.
- Hold off on that.

14:23.876 --> 14:26.675
If the bomber's a member of the track,
a warrant may tip them off.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.305
Have Kensi and Deeks
check out Norris' house.

14:29.482 --> 14:31.644
G and I will hit the track,
pose as potential members.

14:31.817 --> 14:33.512
That's not gonna be easy.

14:33.686 --> 14:36.417
Memberships are tough to come by.
Referrals only.

14:36.589 --> 14:37.829
Unless you pull up in something

14:37.990 --> 14:40.550
that, uh, the members want to see
on their track.

14:40.726 --> 14:43.627
Something maybe a little more exotic
than the Challenger?

14:43.796 --> 14:46.026
- No offense.
- None taken.

14:53.472 --> 14:55.634
Now all we have to do
is convince Hetty.

14:55.808 --> 14:57.435
Unless...

14:57.610 --> 14:59.271
Unless what?

15:00.680 --> 15:02.546
- G.
- It would take us, what,

15:02.715 --> 15:04.547
45 minutes to get there and back?

15:05.051 --> 15:06.610
Gentlemen.

15:06.786 --> 15:08.379
Are you going somewhere?

15:08.554 --> 15:11.421
Hetty, Omni is a priority
for state and the president.

15:11.591 --> 15:13.151
Which is why
we have to get on the track

15:13.292 --> 15:15.659
and see
if the bomber left any evidence.

15:15.828 --> 15:17.694
In my Cobra?

15:18.631 --> 15:19.928
With who driving?

15:20.099 --> 15:21.533
Me.

15:21.701 --> 15:23.533
Oh, you've clearly
thought this through.

15:23.703 --> 15:26.263
- Of course. I will drive.
- We have. I will drive.

15:26.439 --> 15:32.037
Gentlemen, this car was restored
to fit me like a glove.

15:33.879 --> 15:35.176
I can fit in the car, Hetty.

15:38.217 --> 15:41.710
Even if you could,
the aerodynamics would be ruined.

15:41.887 --> 15:44.754
"Aerodynamics are for people
who can't build engines."

15:44.924 --> 15:46.949
From the mouth
of Enzo Ferrari himself.

15:47.126 --> 15:49.117
- Impressive.
- Oh, yes, very.

15:50.263 --> 15:51.788
You still can't drive my car.

15:52.999 --> 15:54.023
Sorry, big fella.

15:55.034 --> 15:58.937
Neither one of you can drive my car.

15:59.105 --> 16:02.700
But you could trailer it to the track.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.604
So we can tow the car to the track?

16:04.777 --> 16:06.905
And then not drive it
around the track?

16:07.079 --> 16:09.047
Precisely.

16:10.116 --> 16:11.447
We'll go to Norris' house.

16:11.617 --> 16:13.244
Have Kensi and Deeks
check out the track.

16:13.419 --> 16:15.114
Splendid idea.

16:15.288 --> 16:17.780
- I could fit in the car, G.
- Yeah, right.

16:20.626 --> 16:22.424
Hello, gorgeous.

16:43.683 --> 16:46.675
- May I help you, ma'am?
- Great. I'm a guest of Tom Norris.

16:50.823 --> 16:51.915
Is there a problem?

16:52.091 --> 16:53.149
Reorientating image.

16:54.193 --> 16:57.128
Ma'am, I'm sorry to tell you this,
but Mr. Norris died earlier today.

16:57.296 --> 16:58.593
Wait, what?

16:58.764 --> 17:01.256
- Everything okay, Bob?
- She's a guest of Mr. Norris.

17:01.434 --> 17:04.768
- I got it from here. Thank you.
- I can't believe this.

17:05.237 --> 17:08.434
I had dinner with Tom two nights ago.
He told me to come by with my car.

17:08.607 --> 17:10.803
I'm so very sorry, uh, Miss...

17:10.976 --> 17:12.876
- Wells.
- Miss Wells.

17:13.846 --> 17:16.713
Look, I don't usually do this,
but why don't you come inside?

17:16.882 --> 17:19.782
I can't allow you to drive back
to Los Angeles in this state.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.913
- Thank you.
- Okay?

17:43.408 --> 17:45.172
This is some good living.

17:45.343 --> 17:47.971
Was. Norris is dead.

17:48.146 --> 17:51.514
Beautiful models, fast cars,
massive beach house.

17:51.683 --> 17:54.653
When the man was living,
he was living.

18:03.428 --> 18:05.453
I don't get this kind of place.

18:05.630 --> 18:07.155
It's not my style.

18:07.332 --> 18:09.562
Good, because it's not
your bank account's style either.

18:09.734 --> 18:12.135
Well, you know what?
Even if I had this kind of money,

18:12.303 --> 18:15.034
I don't know,
all this glass and this stone,

18:15.206 --> 18:16.867
- it's just a little...
- Cold?

18:17.942 --> 18:21.173
- Not homey enough for you?
- Yeah. Maybe.

18:21.346 --> 18:23.306
This coming from a guy
who lived out of a rucksack

18:23.448 --> 18:25.143
and cheap motels for five years.

18:25.316 --> 18:27.717
It was a homey little rucksack.

18:31.423 --> 18:33.687
Sam, got Leonard's personnel file.

18:33.858 --> 18:35.298
Norris must've been looking
into him.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.588
Oh, Kensi thought something was off
with the doctor.

18:38.129 --> 18:39.528
Maybe Norris did too.

18:44.235 --> 18:45.930
Got a number here.

18:50.542 --> 18:52.271
FBI. L.A. field office.

18:52.444 --> 18:55.072
Why was Norris contacting the FBI?

18:55.246 --> 18:57.078
I don't know.

18:59.184 --> 19:02.313
- Uh, G?
- Maybe Kensi's hunch...

19:02.487 --> 19:04.046
You may wanna see this.

19:14.599 --> 19:16.397
Should we put our hands up?

19:16.568 --> 19:17.933
Wanna cuff us?

19:18.102 --> 19:19.331
Who are you?

19:19.504 --> 19:20.630
- Bree.
- Tammie.

19:20.805 --> 19:22.170
Oh, that clears everything up.

19:22.340 --> 19:23.398
We're friends of Tommy's.

19:25.009 --> 19:26.340
He in some kind of trouble?

19:26.511 --> 19:27.740
Are we in trouble?

19:27.912 --> 19:29.505
Thomas Norris was killed
this morning.

19:29.681 --> 19:31.171
What?

19:31.516 --> 19:35.749
- Tommy's dead?
- No, he can't be.

19:40.124 --> 19:41.990
Can we still use the pool?

19:42.660 --> 19:44.992
Deeks is gonna kill himself
for missing this.

19:45.163 --> 19:47.689
Yeah, we might not wanna mention
this one.

19:50.001 --> 19:51.435
Mr. And Mrs. Woller,

19:51.603 --> 19:52.883
please report to Guest Services.

19:54.239 --> 19:57.231
Mr. And Mrs. Woller, please report
to Guest Services. Thank you.

19:57.408 --> 19:59.376
I've placed you on the guest list
at the day spa.

19:59.544 --> 20:00.739
Thank you so much.

20:00.912 --> 20:02.607
- Here's some water.
- Thanks.

20:02.780 --> 20:05.078
Do you mind if I take a look
at the car you brought?

20:05.250 --> 20:06.513
Oh, no, not at all.

20:06.684 --> 20:08.675
- That's why I brought it.
- Great.

20:12.790 --> 20:15.225
Easy, easy.

20:15.727 --> 20:17.718
Careful. Easy.

20:17.896 --> 20:19.489
All right, all right.

20:20.265 --> 20:21.562
Shelby Cobra.

20:21.733 --> 20:23.724
That's right. Family heirloom.

20:23.902 --> 20:26.234
Brady, let her on the track.
I got to see this Cobra run.

20:26.404 --> 20:28.634
Heh. No.
I don't know if I could do that.

20:28.806 --> 20:31.138
Yeah, you do know, Kensi.
You need to drive this car,

20:31.309 --> 20:33.471
because I cannot sit in the back
of this truck forever.

20:33.645 --> 20:35.170
How about it?

20:36.347 --> 20:37.644
Let's give this Cobra a go.

20:37.815 --> 20:39.146
Yeah, Kensilina, how about it?

20:39.317 --> 20:42.150
- I just... I don't think I should.
- Not even a lap?

20:42.320 --> 20:44.584
Stop worrying about Hetty,
because if you don't drive,

20:44.756 --> 20:45.916
they'll think something's up.

20:46.057 --> 20:48.116
- Is this really your car?
- Told you.

20:48.293 --> 20:51.661
Are you kidding me?
Of course, it's my car. It's my baby.

20:51.829 --> 20:56.027
- If it's your baby, then drive it.
- Don't drive the car, Kensi.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.294
She won't,
unless she wants her head on a stake.

20:58.469 --> 20:59.994
Kensi, drive the car.

21:00.171 --> 21:03.106
Do not do it. Hetty will kill you.

21:16.020 --> 21:18.114
Ladies
and gentlemen, we are presenting

21:18.289 --> 21:21.020
a vintage exhibition sports car
at the starting line.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.354
You don't wanna miss this one.

21:46.317 --> 21:47.580
Go!

22:01.466 --> 22:02.490
Is that my Cobra?

22:04.102 --> 22:07.470
Is Miss Blye driving my Cobra?

22:07.639 --> 22:11.405
Uh, act... Uh, well, she's, um...

22:11.576 --> 22:13.738
Yes, Kensi had to drive it
to maintain her cover

22:13.911 --> 22:16.642
and provide Deeks with the opportunity
to search the garage.

22:16.814 --> 22:18.009
That.

22:48.546 --> 22:49.604
Yes.

22:59.190 --> 23:01.420
Come to Papa.

23:13.204 --> 23:16.936
FBI's got no record of Tom Norris
calling their L.A. field office.

23:17.108 --> 23:20.703
Well, whatever he wanted to tell them,
he never got a chance to.

23:22.346 --> 23:24.280
Ho-ho, nice driving, Kens.

23:24.449 --> 23:26.440
What can I say? I'm a natural.

23:26.617 --> 23:28.312
And I am a crime fighter.

23:29.053 --> 23:31.021
Evidence from Norris' garage.

23:31.522 --> 23:34.981
Ah. Metal cap, bolt, chewed gum.
I'll get it to Forensics.

23:35.159 --> 23:38.959
Ooh. Actually, the gum may be...

23:39.130 --> 23:40.461
- Yeah, no, that's mine.
- Ew.

23:40.631 --> 23:42.258
- Gross.
- Jackpot.

23:42.433 --> 23:44.527
Facial rec got hits back
from the racetrack.

23:45.570 --> 23:46.594
Triple cherries.

23:46.771 --> 23:48.739
Three different guys affiliated

23:48.906 --> 23:51.136
with three different
Eurasian crime syndicates.

23:51.309 --> 23:55.769
And all three groups
have known members in Omni.

23:55.947 --> 23:57.415
Check out this guy Rasik.

23:57.949 --> 23:59.644
Interpol's got him
as a person of interest

23:59.817 --> 24:01.876
in over ten murders related to Omni.

24:02.053 --> 24:03.817
Well, Omni
has the white phosphorus

24:03.988 --> 24:06.787
and they had access
to Norris' Ferrari at the track.

24:06.958 --> 24:09.518
- That's weird.
- It's more like incriminating.

24:09.694 --> 24:11.890
No. I set up an alert to notify us

24:12.063 --> 24:15.055
if anyone opened the vault
at Norris Bio Tech.

24:15.600 --> 24:16.692
That's Dr. Leonard.

24:16.868 --> 24:19.200
He's pulling all the ricin
vaccine samples.

24:20.004 --> 24:22.530
- And now he's leaving.
- Call Callen and Sam.

24:22.707 --> 24:23.731
They're close by.

24:24.609 --> 24:25.906
Hi.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.417
Dr. Leonard. Federal agents.

24:39.190 --> 24:40.419
Like to have a word with you.

24:40.591 --> 24:42.252
- He's gonna run.
- No way.

24:43.995 --> 24:46.487
- Unbelievable.
- I told you.

24:49.967 --> 24:51.560
No! Please! Aah!

24:51.736 --> 24:53.795
How'd you think
this was gonna play out?

24:53.971 --> 24:56.463
You have to help me.
You don't understand.

24:56.641 --> 24:57.733
This isn't what it seems.

24:57.909 --> 24:59.900
They took my family.

25:00.077 --> 25:02.068
You got to believe me.

25:06.517 --> 25:10.249
Dr. Leonard does indeed
have a wife and son.

25:10.755 --> 25:11.984
But I can't locate them.

25:12.156 --> 25:14.284
Any communication
between the doctor and Omni?

25:14.458 --> 25:17.018
I did pull this text exchange
from his phone.

25:17.895 --> 25:21.889
The text said I could trade
vaccine samples for my family.

25:22.066 --> 25:25.036
- And you have no idea who sent it?
- No.

25:25.203 --> 25:28.036
You spoke with two NCIS agents
earlier.

25:28.206 --> 25:30.106
Why didn't you show them
the text message?

25:30.541 --> 25:34.535
I was told if I involved the police
that they'd...

25:35.613 --> 25:36.978
They'd be killed.

25:39.684 --> 25:43.177
Well, getting your family back
is our top priority.

25:43.354 --> 25:45.448
Well, then go get them back.
Please.

25:45.623 --> 25:48.285
We don't know where they're holding
your wife and son.

25:48.459 --> 25:50.689
But we do know
they want this vaccine.

25:51.696 --> 25:54.427
They'll be there
when they set the meet-up with you.

25:54.699 --> 25:57.031
You'll be wired for sound and video.

25:57.201 --> 25:58.362
We won't lose sight of you.

25:58.536 --> 26:00.470
- As soon as...
- I don't know if I can do this.

26:03.107 --> 26:04.632
You can.

26:04.942 --> 26:06.034
I'm not good at, uh...

26:07.245 --> 26:08.474
I can't...

26:08.646 --> 26:10.478
You have to.

26:19.557 --> 26:21.992
Omni has to be behind this.

26:22.927 --> 26:26.557
You know, I get them strong-arming
Leonard for the vaccine samples.

26:27.331 --> 26:28.492
But why kill Norris?

26:29.267 --> 26:30.996
Maybe they went to him first.

26:31.168 --> 26:32.658
Norris didn't wanna play ball,

26:32.837 --> 26:36.239
he has no family to leverage
against him, so they kill him.

26:37.041 --> 26:38.440
Yeah.

26:38.609 --> 26:41.340
It makes Leonard more likely
to cooperate.

26:42.980 --> 26:46.177
Whoever did this knows a lot
about Norris Bio Tech.

26:46.350 --> 26:47.750
Could be dealing
with an inside man.

27:03.534 --> 27:04.968
He's an awkward guy.

27:05.136 --> 27:07.002
You think he can handle it?

27:07.171 --> 27:08.400
He's got no choice.

27:16.781 --> 27:19.375
You know, the goal here
was to look like a Hollywood hipster.

27:19.550 --> 27:22.884
Ensemble you got going,
it's like Gap threw up some Hot Topic.

27:23.054 --> 27:24.317
Definitely not hip.

27:24.488 --> 27:26.513
Yeah, well,
it takes a special kind of guy

27:26.691 --> 27:27.817
to wear jeans that skinny.

27:27.992 --> 27:30.757
Oh, they're tight.
I mean, they're real tight.

27:30.928 --> 27:33.989
They're tight because I need my space.
You know what I mean?

27:34.165 --> 27:35.758
Tight in all the right places.

27:37.134 --> 27:39.193
And yet you still
found room to hide your gun.

27:39.370 --> 27:41.600
They're like Archie and Edith.

27:41.839 --> 27:43.273
It's more
like Archie and Meathead.

27:44.775 --> 27:47.710
Either way, they're getting
their groove back as partners.

27:53.017 --> 27:55.042
I've seen guys go through worse.

27:55.219 --> 27:58.348
- He's gonna be fine.
- Heads up, guys.

27:58.522 --> 28:01.856
It's Rasik, one of the Omni members
from the track.

28:02.026 --> 28:03.551
Something's up.
He wouldn't come alone.

28:03.728 --> 28:07.062
- Deeks, you see a spotter?
- Negative.

28:09.467 --> 28:10.947
He's moving the doctor
on to the curb.

28:11.102 --> 28:14.265
- He's moving towards the bus.
- On it. Go.

28:16.173 --> 28:17.368
Watch out.

28:24.148 --> 28:25.309
We lost him on the bus.

28:33.090 --> 28:35.354
I knew it.
I told you he'd use the bus trick.

28:35.526 --> 28:36.687
No, you didn't.

28:36.861 --> 28:38.581
Well, I may not have actually
verbalized it.

28:38.729 --> 28:40.209
- Oh, but you were thinking it?
- Yup.

28:40.364 --> 28:42.731
Uh-huh. Get ahead of the bus,
would you, Nostradamus?

28:47.905 --> 28:50.465
Dr. Leonard just handed Rasik
the container with the vaccine.

29:00.484 --> 29:01.610
He has it.

29:01.786 --> 29:03.811
- G, he's getting off the bus.
- I got him.

29:24.642 --> 29:26.269
Go, go.

29:45.463 --> 29:47.227
Federal agents.

30:07.485 --> 30:08.816
He doesn't have the vaccine.

30:25.301 --> 30:26.894
Omni wasn't taking any chances.

30:27.070 --> 30:28.834
Well, it's a good thing
we weren't either.

30:29.005 --> 30:31.997
Eric, where are we with the GPS
tracker on the vaccine vials?

30:32.175 --> 30:34.535
I can't get a signal from the tracker.
Let me try something.

30:34.677 --> 30:36.372
Find me that signal, Eric.

30:36.546 --> 30:39.015
Omni has the resources
to make a quick exit.

30:39.182 --> 30:40.343
Guys, I found the handoff.

30:40.883 --> 30:44.217
Before Rasik exited the bus,
a woman took the fake vaccine,

30:44.387 --> 30:46.185
and probably spotted you guys.

30:46.356 --> 30:48.051
I'm running her through facial rec
now.

30:48.224 --> 30:49.419
How you doing?

30:49.592 --> 30:52.254
You mean after my first violent
confrontation back on the job?

30:52.428 --> 30:53.554
You didn't take the shot.

30:53.730 --> 30:55.926
I thought it'd be overkill
if I shot him too.

30:56.099 --> 30:58.534
- Get that? Overkill? Because he's...
- Uh-huh.

30:58.701 --> 31:00.897
Okay, listen, Kensi,
I'm fine, all right?

31:01.070 --> 31:03.230
I didn't take the shot
because I didn't have the angle.

31:03.373 --> 31:04.863
Sam and Callen
were in my sight line.

31:07.744 --> 31:08.905
I'm good.

31:15.051 --> 31:17.247
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

31:19.122 --> 31:20.817
God, you guys, I'm fine, all right?

31:20.990 --> 31:22.981
You can stop walking around me
on egg shells.

31:23.159 --> 31:26.424
I understand it's my first day back and
you're worried about me, but I'm good.

31:27.263 --> 31:30.164
You know what? I'm better than good.
I haven't wet the bed in over a week

31:30.333 --> 31:32.301
and the voices in my head
are all but gone away.

31:32.468 --> 31:35.335
- Shut up. No, you shut up. I'm fine.
- Seems good to me.

31:35.938 --> 31:37.167
Thank you.

31:38.408 --> 31:42.038
Hey, guys, get this. Facial rec
hit a passport from Croatia.

31:42.211 --> 31:45.078
Natalija Tutic,
and she's got ties to Omni.

31:45.248 --> 31:46.545
I'm sending you a pic now.

31:46.716 --> 31:48.707
Do you know
what kind of car she's driving?

31:48.885 --> 31:50.785
Negative. But her signal just came up.

31:54.557 --> 31:57.083
She's exiting the 10 East
and headed north on the 605.

31:57.260 --> 31:58.455
Angeles Ridge Racing Club.

31:58.628 --> 32:00.228
They have a helipad
and a private runway.

32:00.396 --> 32:03.457
Track was Omni's exit plan
for the vaccine. Let's do it.

32:11.841 --> 32:13.206
There was an outside investor.

32:15.344 --> 32:16.971
Tom Norris funded Norris Bio Tech

32:17.146 --> 32:19.638
from the windfall he made
on past bio-patents, right?

32:20.316 --> 32:22.250
About 14 months ago,
he started a new company

32:22.418 --> 32:23.817
and diverted all his funds there.

32:23.986 --> 32:26.853
So Norris Bio Tech
needed an outside investor.

32:27.023 --> 32:29.822
- Hmm. Now, if I were a betting gal...
- Which you are.

32:29.992 --> 32:31.016
- Which I am.
- Yeah.

32:31.194 --> 32:34.061
I would wager that the influx in cash

32:34.230 --> 32:37.564
came in after Norris Bio Tech
made headway on the ricin vaccine.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.729
And you, my lady,
would win that wager.

32:39.902 --> 32:42.337
Fourteen months ago,
they started phase two of the project.

32:42.505 --> 32:43.666
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

32:44.407 --> 32:46.239
So who made the investment?

32:46.409 --> 32:48.741
Uh, well, okay, the money came in

32:48.911 --> 32:50.743
- through Moorpark Capital.
- Right.

32:50.913 --> 32:54.144
Which is the venture capital arm for the
holding company Truftin Investments,

32:54.317 --> 32:56.843
which is an asset
of Lindencrest Ventures.

32:57.019 --> 32:59.454
Sure. And...?

32:59.822 --> 33:02.757
And the funds came in
through this guy.

33:03.326 --> 33:05.124
Henrik Vuksan.

33:05.294 --> 33:08.594
Interpol lists Vuksan
as a high-ranking member of Omni.

33:08.764 --> 33:09.959
And Homeland Security

33:10.132 --> 33:13.693
had him flying into L.A. this morning
on a French passport.

33:14.604 --> 33:17.130
That's who they're taking
the vaccine to.

33:20.943 --> 33:23.063
Norris wasn't bragging
about his company at the track.

33:23.212 --> 33:25.374
No, Omni was in on this
from the beginning.

33:25.548 --> 33:26.777
They bet on him.

33:26.949 --> 33:28.789
Bet he'd put together
the right group of people

33:28.951 --> 33:30.476
to crack the code on the vaccine.

33:30.653 --> 33:33.122
They were just using the track
to stay close to him.

33:33.289 --> 33:34.347
Working the long game.

33:34.524 --> 33:36.856
It still doesn't explain
why they killed Norris.

33:48.204 --> 33:50.070
May I be of some assistance to you,
gentlemen?

33:50.239 --> 33:52.264
Federal agents.
We have reason to believe a suspect

33:52.441 --> 33:54.081
in our investigation
is on these premises.

33:54.210 --> 33:55.644
If that's the case, I'd cooperate.

33:55.811 --> 33:58.041
Our members' privacy is important.
Can you stop walking?

33:58.214 --> 34:00.012
I can't let you in there
without a warrant.

34:00.182 --> 34:01.843
That doesn't sound like cooperation...

34:02.018 --> 34:03.577
Partner.

34:04.253 --> 34:06.221
I don't wanna have to call security.

34:06.389 --> 34:07.515
Down, down, down!

34:11.427 --> 34:13.690
Good thing I don't need a warrant
to save your life.

34:26.876 --> 34:28.275
He's running for the track.

34:38.020 --> 34:39.681
He's headed for the club exit.

34:51.567 --> 34:53.295
Enough of this.

35:03.112 --> 35:05.046
- You got this?
- I got this.

35:22.231 --> 35:23.995
Out of the car.

35:27.370 --> 35:28.667
Put your hands on the car.

35:33.075 --> 35:34.839
That's some damn fine driving,
partner.

35:35.011 --> 35:37.139
American muscle, baby.

35:42.184 --> 35:43.208
What do you got, Eric?

35:43.386 --> 35:45.320
Forensics are back
on the evidence Deeks got

35:45.488 --> 35:46.717
from Norris' garage.

35:46.889 --> 35:48.729
Now, the bolt
is from the Ferrari's suspension,

35:48.891 --> 35:50.825
but the metal cap
is for a jar of liquid cement

35:50.993 --> 35:52.859
and it had white phosphorus trace
on it.

35:53.029 --> 35:55.020
Used the liquid cement
to mount the trigger.

35:55.531 --> 35:57.226
- Any prints?
- One.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.198
Running it through AFIS now.
So far, no hits.

35:59.368 --> 36:00.836
But, Callen,

36:01.003 --> 36:05.065
I checked it against Maran Rasik
and Henrik Vuksan's prints.

36:05.408 --> 36:06.637
It doesn't belong to them.

36:08.244 --> 36:09.473
That bombers still out there.

36:23.658 --> 36:25.717
If you didn't plant the bomb
that killed Norris,

36:25.893 --> 36:28.590
then which one
of your Omni comrades did?

36:29.464 --> 36:31.489
Why do you people think
we killed Norris?

36:31.666 --> 36:33.998
Files on his computer.

36:34.168 --> 36:36.330
He discovered Omni was investing
in Norris Bio Tech

36:36.504 --> 36:38.268
and he was going to the FBI
with the proof.

36:38.439 --> 36:41.465
If Norris is dead, FBI isn't involved.

36:41.943 --> 36:43.934
Even you can follow that logic.

36:45.613 --> 36:48.412
Omni's interests lie in commerce.

36:48.583 --> 36:51.075
Norris was a great CEO.

36:51.252 --> 36:54.119
Commerce is better for us
when Norris is CEO.

36:56.557 --> 36:59.117
Omni was just hanging back,
driving cool cars on the track,

36:59.293 --> 37:01.193
waiting until Norris Bio Tech
had a vaccine.

37:01.362 --> 37:04.297
When Norris was killed,
they realize the heat's coming down.

37:04.465 --> 37:06.331
They gotta get those vaccines out,
leave town.

37:06.501 --> 37:08.299
Dr. Leonard had access.

37:08.469 --> 37:09.994
He was easy to manipulate.

37:11.539 --> 37:13.166
Hey, guys, get this.

37:14.075 --> 37:16.009
Ten days ago, Norris Bio Tech

37:16.177 --> 37:19.442
ordered the necessary elements
to make white phosphorus.

37:19.614 --> 37:21.454
Was the purchase linked
to a specific employee?

37:21.516 --> 37:25.817
Mm-mm. The items were lumped
into a larger cross-company order.

37:25.987 --> 37:28.319
Is it possible
our boy's telling the truth?

37:28.489 --> 37:31.481
Someone within Norris Bio Tech
killed Norris using Omni's MO?

37:33.060 --> 37:34.940
Norris could've confided
in one of his employees

37:35.096 --> 37:37.326
that Omni was an investor
in his own company.

37:38.166 --> 37:39.827
It wouldn't take much research
to find out

37:40.001 --> 37:41.867
that Omni stole a shipment
of white phosphorus.

37:42.036 --> 37:43.697
You kill Norris
with white phosphorus,

37:43.871 --> 37:45.862
the investigation goes straight
to Omni.

37:46.908 --> 37:49.377
Norris could've told anyone
in the company about Omni.

37:51.279 --> 37:52.872
If it was me,

37:53.714 --> 37:56.376
I'm going to the person
I started three companies with.

37:58.486 --> 37:59.954
- Rick Paulson.
- Exactly.

38:00.922 --> 38:04.483
Norris tells Paulson about Omni's
investment in Norris Bio Tech.

38:04.659 --> 38:08.391
Paulson sees it as his opportunity
to get out of Norris' shadow,

38:08.563 --> 38:09.962
and take control of the company.

38:10.131 --> 38:11.690
It's good timing.

38:11.866 --> 38:14.733
Right before the ricin vaccine profits
started rolling in.

38:14.902 --> 38:19.738
Guys, we just got an ID off the print
on the metal cap from Norris' garage.

38:20.208 --> 38:21.539
Mr. Paulson,

38:21.709 --> 38:23.109
there's some people
here to see you.

38:23.244 --> 38:24.764
The press conference
is in ten minutes.

38:24.912 --> 38:26.512
I'll answer any questions
they have then.

38:26.681 --> 38:28.046
Sir, they're federal agents.

38:44.732 --> 38:45.824
Hey! Stop!

38:48.336 --> 38:49.701
Drop your weapon.

38:50.371 --> 38:51.668
No, lady, get down!

38:51.839 --> 38:52.863
Aah!

38:59.480 --> 39:00.914
Easy.

39:01.082 --> 39:02.743
It's over.

39:03.150 --> 39:04.174
Stop moving.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.645
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

39:07.822 --> 39:10.189
- She's okay.
- Someone get this giant off of me.

39:10.358 --> 39:11.951
He's not a giant.

39:12.126 --> 39:13.184
He's just husky.

39:16.697 --> 39:18.426
- Kensi, you good?
- Oh, yeah.

39:18.599 --> 39:20.590
- You?
- Perfect.

39:20.768 --> 39:22.167
Get up.

39:22.870 --> 39:26.397
Yo, Deeks, that was crazy, man,
how you just saved that woman's life

39:26.574 --> 39:28.133
and then fell down a 90-foot cliff?

39:28.309 --> 39:30.903
What? Don't worry about it.
It's just a job, man. It's what I do.

39:31.078 --> 39:33.945
Break hearts and save lives, huh?

39:34.115 --> 39:36.174
Just knowing you guys care,
that's enough, right?

39:38.185 --> 39:40.425
What does it mean when you got pains
going down your back

39:40.588 --> 39:42.454
and you can't feel your legs?

39:43.524 --> 39:45.424
Watch it, wa...

39:45.593 --> 39:47.083
Right there. Boom!

39:47.261 --> 39:50.287
I made up two seconds on that turn.
That is some pretty cornering.

39:50.464 --> 39:52.262
Maybe we should show
this video to Hetty.

39:52.433 --> 39:53.958
That wouldn't be pretty.

39:54.135 --> 39:56.604
That was masterful driving,
Miss Blye.

39:56.771 --> 39:59.001
Thank you. I mean, I'm sorry.

39:59.173 --> 40:01.073
Oh, no, no, no, don't apologize.

40:01.242 --> 40:03.677
You drove her the way
she was meant to be driven.

40:05.179 --> 40:08.274
If that's the case, then I can fit in...

40:11.952 --> 40:14.444
- Did you say something, Mr. Hanna?
- Oh, nothing.

40:15.623 --> 40:16.886
Nothing.

40:17.792 --> 40:18.953
- I'm straight.
- Oh.

40:19.126 --> 40:23.120
Uh, I need to inform you all
that because of an executive order,

40:23.698 --> 40:29.467
Omni's shares of Norris Bio Tech
are now the property of the U.S.

40:29.637 --> 40:34.939
And Dr. Leonard will be
the acting president of the company.

40:36.410 --> 40:38.037
- That's it.
- Good for him.

40:38.212 --> 40:39.304
See? I told you.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.814
He's, uh, socially awkward and
annoying because he's a super genius.

40:42.983 --> 40:47.113
- Great. What's your excuse?
- Ow. Walked into that one.

40:48.222 --> 40:49.519
Deeks, can I talk to you?

40:49.690 --> 40:51.852
Yeah, the back is fine,
thanks for asking.

40:53.060 --> 40:55.961
- I don't want you here.
- Sorry. What?

40:58.566 --> 41:01.536
Okay, this is usually
where you insert the punch line.

41:02.937 --> 41:05.167
I don't want you here
until you're ready to be back.

41:05.873 --> 41:08.535
Heh. Okay. Did you...?
Did you see me today?

41:08.709 --> 41:10.939
I mean,
I was like Starsky and Hutch.

41:11.112 --> 41:12.375
I'm talking about your mindset.

41:12.546 --> 41:14.139
Mindset.

41:14.482 --> 41:16.610
I can't have you coming here
second-guessing yourself,

41:16.784 --> 41:19.651
trying to figure out
if this job still makes sense for you.

41:19.820 --> 41:21.788
That's not safe for you.

41:22.256 --> 41:24.315
It's not safe for us.

41:24.992 --> 41:26.357
Yeah.

41:28.462 --> 41:30.556
Well, I wanna be here,

41:31.766 --> 41:33.256
and I'm ready to be back.

41:38.105 --> 41:39.436
Good.

41:41.242 --> 41:42.937
Let's go, partner.

41:52.086 --> 41:53.679
See you tomorrow.

41:55.523 --> 41:58.015
- Nighty night.
- Night.

41:58.726 --> 41:59.750
So wanna go to dinner?

42:02.163 --> 42:04.530
I get it if you don't. It's okay.

42:05.199 --> 42:08.100
No, no, that's a...
That's a fantastic idea.

42:08.269 --> 42:10.567
Let's do that. Let's grab dinner.

42:11.238 --> 42:12.569
Nice.

42:12.740 --> 42:14.230
Bulgogi.

42:14.408 --> 42:15.773
Bulgogi.

42:15.943 --> 42:17.308
What are you doing?

42:17.478 --> 42:18.775
That's my bulgogi dance.

42:18.946 --> 42:21.506
You need to stop doing that
because it's freaking me out.

42:21.682 --> 42:23.650
And also, I'm not really
in the mood for Korean.

42:23.818 --> 42:26.344
Well, that's too bad, buster,

42:26.520 --> 42:29.455
because I have been craving
some pajeon with, uh:

42:29.623 --> 42:31.113
Bulgogi.

42:31.292 --> 42:32.885
- All day.
- I thought earlier

42:33.060 --> 42:35.552
you said that today,
I get to, uh, choose the restaurant.

42:35.729 --> 42:38.699
But that was lunch.
And now it's dinner.

42:38.866 --> 42:41.301
And for dinner, we're gonna do:

42:41.469 --> 42:42.493
Bulgogi.

42:42.670 --> 42:44.468
Okay, your logic is super flawed.

42:44.638 --> 42:47.039
But I'll go as long as you stop doing
whatever that is.

42:47.208 --> 42:48.232
What? You mean this?

42:48.409 --> 42:49.899
Actually, that's working for me.

42:50.077 --> 42:52.341
I dig it, keep it, bounce with it.

42:52.746 --> 42:55.807
Welcome back, Mr. Deeks.
