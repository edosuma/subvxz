THE LAST NIGHT BEFORE
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE,

33:58.370 --> 34:01.338
I JUST -- I HELD HIM.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.373
MY SON.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.909
I WAS ADOPTED, OKAY,

34:05.911 --> 34:07.611
SO IT WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME
THAT I'D EVER LOOKED INTO EYES

34:07.613 --> 34:09.413
THAT WERE RELATED TO MINE
BY BLOOD.

34:09.415 --> 34:13.550
I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS
GONNA FEEL LIKE THAT,

34:13.552 --> 34:16.019
AND HE -- HE --
HE JUST SLEPT.

34:16.021 --> 34:19.322
YOU KNOW,
HE JUST SLEPT IN MY ARMS.

34:19.324 --> 34:23.493
HE WAS
THE MOST PERFECT THING

34:23.495 --> 34:26.696
THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO ME
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.365
AND THE NEXT MORNING,

34:28.367 --> 34:30.901
HEATHER SAID THAT SHE HAD ONE
MORE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

34:30.903 --> 34:32.436
SHE TOOK HIM WITH HER,

34:32.438 --> 34:34.838
AND I WAITED, AND I WAITED,
AND SHE --

34:34.840 --> 34:36.373
NEVER CAME BACK.

34:36.375 --> 34:39.042
SO THEN YOU STARTED CALLING
THE COUPLES

34:39.044 --> 34:41.978
THAT YOU HAD SCAMMED
AND FOUND HER AT THE HOTEL.

34:41.980 --> 34:44.981
SHE MADE ME WAIT IN THE CAR
TWO BLOCKS AWAY, OKAY?

34:44.983 --> 34:46.683
IT WAS RAINING REALLY HARD,

34:46.685 --> 34:48.852
AND SHE JUST SHOWED UP
SOAKING WET.

34:48.854 --> 34:50.620
I ASKED HER WHERE THE BABY WAS,
AND SHE SAID --

34:50.622 --> 34:52.122
[ CHUCKLES ]

34:52.124 --> 34:54.858
SHE SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT
ANY BABY OF HERS

34:54.860 --> 34:57.427
TO EVER HAVE SOMEONE LIKE ME
AS A FATHER

34:57.429 --> 34:59.930
BECAUSE I WAS "UNRELIABLE."

34:59.932 --> 35:02.933
THEN SHE TOSSED A BAG OF MONEY
IN THE BACK OF THE CAR LIKE --

35:02.935 --> 35:04.568
LIKE SHE WAS PAYING ME OFF.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.404
SO I STARTED FOR THE HOTEL,
AND -- AND SHE GRABBED ME,

35:07.406 --> 35:09.072
AND SHE JUST STARTED
PUNCHING ME,

35:09.074 --> 35:10.874
LIKE OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.442
I-I WAS JUST TRYING
TO DEFEND MYSELF.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.710
AND SHE SLIPPED
ON THE PAVEMENT,

35:13.712 --> 35:15.412
AND HER HEAD
HIT THE CAR DOOR.

35:15.414 --> 35:18.815
BUT, LOOK, I TRIED TO STOP
THE BLEEDING WITH THAT BLANKET.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.751
I-I-I DID NOT BEAT HER,
HONEST.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.019
AND HER HEAD,
IT DIDN'T EVEN LOOK THAT BAD.

35:23.021 --> 35:24.888
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.790
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

35:26.792 --> 35:28.024
OH, WHAT HAPPENED WAS

35:28.026 --> 35:30.093
YOU PUNCHED HEATHER
IN THE THROAT,

35:30.095 --> 35:33.096
WHICH CAUSED HER WINDPIPE
TO SWELL UP,

35:33.098 --> 35:35.398
WHICH CAUSED HER
TO SUFFOCATE TO DEATH

35:35.400 --> 35:37.167
WHILE YOU STOOD THERE
AND WATCHED.

35:37.169 --> 35:38.435
OKAY, LOOK.

35:38.437 --> 35:39.603
LISTEN, OKAY?

35:39.605 --> 35:42.038
NONE OF THAT
WAS ON PURPOSE.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.840
BUT DRAGGING HER BODY
TO THE ENTRY

35:43.842 --> 35:47.010
OF THE DRAIN
WAS ON PURPOSE.

35:47.012 --> 35:50.113
STUFFING HER DOWN IT
WAS ON PURPOSE.

35:50.115 --> 35:52.983
LEAVING HER THERE --

35:52.985 --> 35:56.119
THAT WAS ON PURPOSE.

35:56.121 --> 35:58.455
AND ENDING UP WITH ALL
OF THE MONEY --

35:58.457 --> 36:03.026
I BET THAT WAS
ON PURPOSE, TOO.

36:05.530 --> 36:08.198
Andrea: SO IT WASN'T AN
ACCIDENT, BUT WITHOUT INTENT,

36:08.200 --> 36:10.901
I CAN'T GO BEYOND
TOP-SHELF MANSLAUGHTER.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.502

SOMETHING SEPARATE

36:14.006 --> 36:15.639

FOR THIS DIRTBAG

36:21.146 --> 36:24.080
AND GET HIM TO SURRENDER
HIS PARENTAL RIGHTS TO THE BOY

36:24.082 --> 36:25.615
AS YOU WORK YOUR WAY DOWN.

36:25.617 --> 36:28.451
THE BABY DESERVES A FAMILY.

36:28.453 --> 36:32.088
BUT WHICH FAMILY?
THAT IS THE QUESTION.

36:44.068 --> 36:47.504
TOM BARNES SIGNED AWAY
HIS PATERNAL RIGHTS,

36:47.506 --> 36:50.774
AND HEATHER LAWSON'S PARENTS
ARE DEAD,

36:50.776 --> 36:54.911

37:12.064 --> 37:14.097
GIVING THE BABY A SHOT
AT A PERMANENT HOME

IS BETTER THAN DUMPING HIM
IN THE SYSTEM, I AGREE.
