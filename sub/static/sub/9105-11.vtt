25:19.518 --> 25:20.986
and hacking.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.146
It can't be real.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.359
It can't be.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.281
Jason?

25:33.157 --> 25:34.750
He landed on top of me,
really close.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.706
He was having some
kind of fit, screaming,

25:36.869 --> 25:38.542
holding me down.
Who?

25:38.704 --> 25:40.081
Jason.

25:40.247 --> 25:41.499
What? He...

25:41.665 --> 25:43.167
He attacked you?
It's all right.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.630
I'm not hurt.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.214
Jason is really...

25:48.380 --> 25:49.927
sick.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.967
Psychotic.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.260
What-what happened?

25:53.427 --> 25:54.770
He was heaving,

25:54.928 --> 25:56.805
retching, saying he had to...

25:56.972 --> 25:58.690
saying he had to get it out.

25:58.849 --> 26:01.352
Then he said he had
to get it into him.

26:01.518 --> 26:02.895
This behavior,
it's the same thing.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.314
Liam, Shirley.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.857
they-they both opened up
their victim.

26:06.023 --> 26:08.071
Now Jason said
he had to-to...

26:08.233 --> 26:10.452
get it into him.

26:10.611 --> 26:12.238
So, Professor Stoddart,

26:12.404 --> 26:14.327
we look inside
his chest cavity,

26:14.490 --> 26:15.833
we find evidence
of whatever it was that...

26:15.991 --> 26:17.334
No, no,
there's nothing there.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.167
A fragment of a fingernail
lodged in the rib,

26:20.329 --> 26:21.376
nothing else.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.040
Petra, Morton,
we all saw it.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.175
Ingrid, we need to get Jason

26:25.334 --> 26:26.677
down in custody
as a man of interest.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.212
What about if...?
Dan.

26:31.507 --> 26:32.929
Maintenance man in the warehouse

26:33.092 --> 26:34.309
assaulted and left unconscious.

26:34.468 --> 26:36.812
Somebody busted his skull.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.064
Jason?

26:39.223 --> 26:41.692
I'll find any witnesses
at the warehouse

26:41.850 --> 26:43.477
who might have seen the assailant.
Get over there.

26:44.812 --> 26:45.654
Petra, it's Dan.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.815
Eric's on his way over.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.484
If the maintenance man wakes up,
make sure you get

26:50.651 --> 26:53.279
a description of his attacker.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.448
Are you okay?

26:56.615 --> 26:59.539
Yes, I'm fine.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.044
I have to go.

27:01.203 --> 27:04.548
I have to find
Professor Stoddart's dog.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.740
Detective Chief Inspector

27:33.902 --> 27:35.404
Eugene Morton,

27:35.571 --> 27:37.448
Metropolitan Police.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.384
I'm so sorry.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.227
See you, bye.

28:08.562 --> 28:10.690
Gave it to the taxidermist.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.985
Vincent,
when livestocks die,

28:14.151 --> 28:16.199
we're supposed
to dispose of them.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.409
But Tavrani asked for it.

28:18.572 --> 28:19.994
He just uses fur sometimes.

28:20.157 --> 28:22.034
This is grave robbery.
It's like Burke and Hare.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.954
I don't take any money for it.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.416
He says to meet him
in the pub.

28:32.085 --> 28:34.429
So now we have covered this
area, we need to move north.

28:34.588 --> 28:37.307
Just get the coordinates
for that.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.969
26, and then...

28:41.470 --> 28:43.472
Dan, I'm at the warehouse.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.393
Any witnesses?

28:47.559 --> 28:49.561
Listen, Dan, the drill's gone.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.480
What?

28:51.647 --> 28:53.069
Jason took the ice drill.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.279
He stole it.

28:54.441 --> 28:57.695
Why the hell
would he do that?

28:57.861 --> 28:59.488
He's off his head;
he's stolen the drill.

28:59.655 --> 29:00.872
He's driven it away.
He's not here.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.952
What if it wasn't him?

29:05.118 --> 29:06.870
But what if it was him?

29:07.037 --> 29:09.210
That thing could cause havoc.

29:09.373 --> 29:11.046
I'm going after it.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.423
Do that.

29:19.466 --> 29:20.513
You okay?

29:20.676 --> 29:22.770
Am I okay?

29:24.513 --> 29:26.015
Well, well, um...

29:26.181 --> 29:28.980
Carrie and I were wondering

29:29.142 --> 29:31.270
if you would like
to have pizza again tonight?

29:31.436 --> 29:33.029
Pizza?

29:33.188 --> 29:35.065
I don't have time for pizza.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.160
Of course.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.788
Well, another time.

29:41.947 --> 29:42.948
No, not another time,

29:43.115 --> 29:44.992
not any time.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.939
♪♪

30:42.341 --> 30:44.309
♪♪

31:10.827 --> 31:12.079
Do you still have the dog?

31:12.245 --> 31:14.373
What dog?

31:14.539 --> 31:17.213
Professor Stoddart's dog.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.923
What do you want
with a dead dog?

31:19.086 --> 31:22.181
I want to examine it.

31:22.339 --> 31:24.433
Uh, hey, everyone.

31:24.591 --> 31:25.467
Hey, everyone.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.936
Urn... some of you know
Jason Donnelly or...

31:31.098 --> 31:32.190
friends of his.

31:32.349 --> 31:34.192
Well, we have to find him

31:34.351 --> 31:35.603
as fast as we can.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.066
And if you do see him...

31:37.229 --> 31:39.323
don't approach him.

31:39.481 --> 31:42.325
Call the police
and-and let us know.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.828
Thanks.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.368
Hi, poppet.

31:51.535 --> 31:54.209
Can I come in and see Liam now,
please, Mrs. Sutter?

31:55.580 --> 31:58.049
Yeah, of course you can.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.551
Come in, take your coat off.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.062
Hi, Liam.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.902
I hear you did something bad.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.788
Did you?

32:35.787 --> 32:39.587
What is that?

32:39.749 --> 32:42.298
It looks a bit scary.

32:53.096 --> 32:56.350
I don't think
my dad's coming home.

33:02.939 --> 33:05.818
I think he's dead.

33:08.778 --> 33:11.247
How is your son?

33:11.406 --> 33:13.829
He's not spoken much.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.369
At all, really.

33:15.535 --> 33:18.129
Since the thing happened.

33:19.498 --> 33:23.219
He's in there, somewhere.

33:23.376 --> 33:26.346
But he doesn't look at me
like he knows me.

33:26.505 --> 33:30.009
He just mutters to that thing.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.389
What thing?

33:36.890 --> 33:39.939
It's a voodoo doll
that Henry gave him.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.444
A tupilaq.

33:41.603 --> 33:44.152
I looked it up.

33:44.314 --> 33:47.864
It's very powerful
in Sami culture.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.404
But every time I try to take it
away from him,

33:50.570 --> 33:52.914
he screams his head off.

33:53.073 --> 33:55.747
Well, then, why don't
you ask Henry to come

33:55.909 --> 33:58.037
and-and take it back?

34:04.668 --> 34:08.297
Henry Tyson is dead.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.717
He killed himself.

34:11.882 --> 34:15.137
He shot and killed DCI Morton
at the same time.

34:18.931 --> 34:22.357
<i>Madre de Dios.</i>

34:22.518 --> 34:25.147
The governor told me.

34:25.313 --> 34:29.489
She warned me,

34:29.650 --> 34:30.902
“Take great care

34:31.069 --> 34:34.322
and be on your guard."

34:41.788 --> 34:43.960
Hey, Frank.

34:44.123 --> 34:45.876
How are you?

34:51.505 --> 34:54.510
110 percent.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.559
What's that?

35:02.726 --> 35:04.353
Stoddart's dog.

35:04.519 --> 35:06.066
Ingrid remembered something.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.948
Did she now?

35:09.107 --> 35:11.360
I need it unfrozen.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.278
Stick it in a microwave.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.447
I want to examine the evidence,
not cook it.

35:15.614 --> 35:16.991
Evidence?

35:17.157 --> 35:19.455
Yeah, I don't know,
it's a really long shot.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.852
He went after the ice drill?
Yes.

35:42.015 --> 35:43.813
Alone?
Yes.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.398
You think Jason might
have stolen it?

35:46.561 --> 35:47.983
Uh, maybe.

35:50.231 --> 35:52.450
We won't know till Eric
tracks the thing down.

35:52.609 --> 35:56.034
Well, if it's not Jason, then
it's someone ruthless enough

35:56.196 --> 35:57.698
to cave a man's skull in

35:57.864 --> 36:01.243
just to steal some stupid
piece of machinery

36:01.409 --> 36:02.581
he can't even get
off the island.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.337
Eric intends to make the arrest

36:04.496 --> 36:07.716
and bring the drill back
to town, no matter who took it.

36:07.874 --> 36:10.343
Does he think I even care
about that stupid drill?

36:10.502 --> 36:12.254
Now?

36:12.420 --> 36:13.512
D-Does he think

36:13.672 --> 36:16.095
that matters anymore,
to anyone?

37:14.232 --> 37:17.486
I murdered Pettigrew.

37:26.745 --> 37:30.545
I took him from the room.

37:30.707 --> 37:32.254
That night.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.715
I took him away,
and I killed him.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.390
Oh.

37:39.549 --> 37:41.426
Cuffed him.

37:44.637 --> 37:46.981
To the pylon on the beach.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.438
Waited.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.605
Bear came.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.648
Bear ate him.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.823
Don't say you did this for me.

37:59.986 --> 38:01.203
Pettigrew would've
pressed charges.

38:01.362 --> 38:02.409
They would've taken you
back to Spain.

38:02.572 --> 38:03.744
He would've walked away.

38:03.907 --> 38:06.205
You did not do this for me.

38:12.457 --> 38:13.879
What's the truth?

38:22.842 --> 38:26.016
He said something
in the police car.

38:26.179 --> 38:27.681
It was...

38:29.849 --> 38:32.853
It was what?

38:33.019 --> 38:35.147
It was the ugliest thing
I ever heard.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.986
Sickened me.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.025
What?
He...

38:41.152 --> 38:42.074
What?

38:42.237 --> 38:44.331
He said that we're the same.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.868
Me and him.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.958
That we both wanted you.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.747
At any cost.

38:54.916 --> 38:58.045
And that...

38:58.211 --> 39:00.305
if you said no to me,

39:00.463 --> 39:02.682
I would do to you
what he did to you.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.938
Take you by force.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.268
I would destroy you.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.938
Destroy me.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.482
I'd never hurt you.

39:20.650 --> 39:23.950
I would never hurt you,
you hear me?

39:28.491 --> 39:31.461
You are in here.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.963
You're inside me.

39:34.122 --> 39:37.092
You're part of me.

39:37.250 --> 39:39.252
I would never
hurt you.

39:39.419 --> 39:40.545
I would never hurt you.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.180
I would kill anybody
who hurt you.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.342
I'd kill myself
if I hurt you.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.603
What do you want from me?

39:56.769 --> 39:57.816
Forgiveness

39:57.979 --> 40:00.858
for what is
inside you?

40:07.989 --> 40:10.162
Tell me one thing.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.043
Be honest, raw.

40:12.201 --> 40:14.124
Okay?

40:14.287 --> 40:17.712
What did you feel when
you saw Pettigrew die?

40:17.874 --> 40:22.550
What did you feel when you fed
a man alive to a wild beast?

40:22.712 --> 40:24.430
Tell me.

40:24.589 --> 40:25.806
What did I feel?

40:25.965 --> 40:27.842
Yes, tell me.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.351
It...

40:32.513 --> 40:35.733
It felt...

40:35.892 --> 40:37.769
I felt...

40:40.563 --> 40:42.861
I felt complete.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.747
<i>We are</i>

40:49.906 --> 40:53.456
two murderers.

40:53.618 --> 40:56.918
You and me.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.754
And we're alone...

40:59.916 --> 41:01.793
together.

41:05.088 --> 41:06.089
Together.

41:06.255 --> 41:09.350
Yes.

41:09.509 --> 41:11.386
Together.

41:14.514 --> 41:16.232
The behavior we're
seeing is complex.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.314
It's not just an
urge, an appetite.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.774
It's directed.
There's a goal.

41:20.937 --> 41:22.189
What goal?

41:22.355 --> 41:24.574
The biosphere
is full of parasites.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.234
They get all they want.

41:26.401 --> 41:29.496
The Cordyceps fungus gets its
spores launched into the air.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.828
Turns an ant into a zombie--
do that.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.459
The liver fluke
takes over

41:34.617 --> 41:36.995
the brain of an ant,
commandeers the body of a cow.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.631
Toxoplasma gondii

41:40.790 --> 41:42.542
brainwashes a rat.

41:42.709 --> 41:47.340
When I got there, I was standing
over Professor Stoddart's body,

41:47.505 --> 41:49.348
fucking shitting myself,

41:49.507 --> 41:51.805
and this dog attacked me.

41:51.968 --> 41:53.891
Yeah, you were threatening
its master.

41:54.053 --> 41:55.350
I was threatening its dinner.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.060
Gross.

41:57.223 --> 42:00.102
Dog has blood and mucus
all over its muzzle.

42:00.268 --> 42:04.614
Whatever was inside
Professor Stoddart

42:04.772 --> 42:06.240
ended up...

42:08.526 --> 42:11.200
...inside the dog.

43:13.800 --> 43:17.270
There's nothing here--
invisible.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.931
No.

43:22.100 --> 43:24.478
Even after it was shot, the
stomach acid kept working.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.447
Hydrochloric
in their stomach's

43:28.606 --> 43:30.279
ten times stronger than ours.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.443
We're not gonna
find anything, are we?

43:32.610 --> 43:33.782
No.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.868
So we're done here?

43:36.030 --> 43:37.907
Yes.

43:43.412 --> 43:45.255
Pass me the pen torch.

43:45.414 --> 43:46.540
What?

43:46.707 --> 43:49.551
Torch.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.587
Can you hold this?

43:55.133 --> 43:57.261
The alimentary canal

43:57.426 --> 44:01.021
before it gets to the stomach
and the stomach acid.

44:07.270 --> 44:08.772
Mucus.
Yeah.

44:23.619 --> 44:26.463
It's a grub.
Whoa.

44:26.622 --> 44:28.249
A larva.

44:35.756 --> 44:37.850
What kind of larva?

44:38.009 --> 44:39.761
The trouble with larva is
you don't know what they are

44:39.927 --> 44:42.180
till they pupate
and hatch.

44:44.348 --> 44:45.975
If larvae passed into
a living host,

44:46.142 --> 44:48.395
then that host is food.

44:48.561 --> 44:51.030
The larvae
develop inside,

44:51.189 --> 44:53.863
feeding off the living
tissue of the host.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.949
Dr. Allerdyce.

44:57.111 --> 44:58.533
Inside her.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.539
Th-That's what's
keeping her alive.

45:00.698 --> 45:01.870
Vincent,

45:02.033 --> 45:04.582
no cutting open live people.

45:04.744 --> 45:05.791
It's unethical.

45:05.953 --> 45:07.079
We have to have
a look at her.

45:07.246 --> 45:08.168
That's all,
nothing invasive.

45:08.331 --> 45:09.583
No cutting.

45:09.749 --> 45:10.750
None whatsoever.

45:15.588 --> 45:17.465

45:46.410 --> 45:48.287

46:27.660 --> 46:29.537

47:52.578 --> 47:54.751
Vincent?

48:05.132 --> 48:06.384
You can't open the door.
You can't...

48:06.550 --> 48:07.676
You can't let
these things out.

48:09.929 --> 48:11.272
What are they?

48:11.430 --> 48:13.603
I don't know.
Get the sheriff!

48:13.766 --> 48:15.814
Okay.

48:28.531 --> 48:29.453
How do we kill them

48:29.615 --> 48:31.413
without killing Vincent?

48:31.575 --> 48:33.452
Natalie, we have
to kill them all.

48:36.664 --> 48:39.042
<i>Jason found
the remains of a mammoth.</i>

48:39.208 --> 48:41.836
We think that those
remains are hazardous.

48:42.002 --> 48:43.504
We're all in danger.

48:43.671 --> 48:45.514
<i>There are always
victims of circumstance.</i>
