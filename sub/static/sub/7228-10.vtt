[laughs]

[Doc reading]

01:02.228 --> 01:03.521
Hi, Mom. I'm home.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.857
[Mom] Hi, sweetie.
How was your day?

01:06.357 --> 01:07.400
Pretty awesome.

01:08.568 --> 01:09.611
That's great,

01:09.694 --> 01:12.155
but I think it's about to get
even more awesome.

01:12.864 --> 01:14.908
No way. Is that for me?

01:15.450 --> 01:16.910
Yep. It's from grandma.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.079
What kind of writing
is this?

01:19.162 --> 01:22.207
It's Japanese.
Grandma is visiting
friends in Japan.

01:23.958 --> 01:27.962
Wow, it's a doll,
and she's really cool.

01:31.007 --> 01:34.469
"Dear Doc, I hope you enjoy
this doll from Japan.

01:35.136 --> 01:36.679
Her name is Kiko,

01:36.763 --> 01:38.973
and I'm sure
she can't wait to meet you.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.350
Love, Grandma."

01:40.683 --> 01:42.477
I can't wait
to meet her, either!

01:43.436 --> 01:46.231
I mean, I'm meeting her
right now, obviously.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.442
Make sure you send Grandma
a thank you note.

01:49.818 --> 01:50.860
I will.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.654
I'm gonna take Kiko
to the clinic.

01:52.987 --> 01:55.907
Great. Just be careful
taking her out of the box.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.535
She's had a very long trip.
Okay.

02:07.919 --> 02:08.877
Hi, everyone.

02:10.045 --> 02:11.172
[all] Hi, Doc.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.843
Look what I got.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.553
Who's the new girl?

02:16.928 --> 02:18.388
I'm Kiko.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.473
I'm Doc and this is Stuffy,

02:20.723 --> 02:22.600
Lambie, Hallie, and Chilly.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.018
[all] Hi, Kiko.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.436
Hi!

02:29.065 --> 02:30.984
Oh, you're still packed up
for your trip.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.235
Let me get that.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.322
There you go.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.075
<span style="style.default_1">Arigato gozaimasu.</span>
Bless you.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.829
Stuffy, that wasn't a sneeze.
That was Japanese.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.998
I said, "Thank you."

02:45.498 --> 02:46.791
Yeah, I knew that.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.002
And why do you
speak Japanese?

02:49.460 --> 02:51.337
Because I'm from Japan.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.590
Wow. Japan.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.967
What kind of store
is that, again?

02:56.050 --> 02:57.927
Japan isn't a store,
Stuffy.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.679
It's a country.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.139
Here, we'll show you.

03:05.894 --> 03:09.230
Okay, this is making me
very dizzy.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.440
Whoo!

03:10.773 --> 03:12.650
-[bubbles popping]
-I popped!

03:13.192 --> 03:15.194
You don't have
anything to pop, Chilly.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.238
You're all stuffing in there.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.490
Well, then my stuffing popped.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.493
Stuffing doesn't pop.
You're bouncing on bubble wrap.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.454
Oh. That explains it.

03:24.662 --> 03:27.332
Hoo-hoo.
Hey, hey, this is fun.

03:27.832 --> 03:31.044
Wait till I hit the bubble wrap
with my action kick.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.422
Ooh. Wow,
can you really do that?

03:34.756 --> 03:35.840
Of course.

03:36.090 --> 03:37.592
I'm an action toy.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.178
That's my big move.

03:40.887 --> 03:41.888
Ha ha!

03:42.305 --> 03:43.932
Whoa!
[gasps]

03:44.265 --> 03:45.099
Oh!

03:46.059 --> 03:47.685
[grunts]

03:47.936 --> 03:50.480
Wow. That was weird.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.899
I can totally jump
better than that.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.359
You okay, sugar?

03:54.692 --> 03:57.820
Oh, yeah.
First day out of the box.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.782
Hmm. I still want
to know where Japan is.

04:01.282 --> 04:04.202
Right. Kiko,
want to help me find Japan?

04:04.744 --> 04:06.788
You bet.
Let's show 'em.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.416
Uh, there it is!

04:10.875 --> 04:15.004
Yep. This is Japan,
and here we are.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.132
[gasps]
That really is far away.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.094
Oh, you must be tired
after all that traveling.

04:21.177 --> 04:24.347
I'm an action toy.
I never get tired.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.850
Standing still all that time
I was traveling from Japan,

04:28.226 --> 04:30.395
well, that was
the hard part for me.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.022
I can't wait to get moving.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.525
Why don't we play a game?

04:35.608 --> 04:37.277
Oh, yeah! Let's do it.

04:37.735 --> 04:41.948
But gotta warn you,
I tend to win a lot.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.326
After all, I am an action toy.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.664
Who wants to take me on...

04:49.747 --> 04:51.457
Oh, me.
In jump rope?

04:51.874 --> 04:53.251
Wait, jump rope?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.753
But I'm not good
at jumping rope.

04:56.587 --> 04:57.839
Tail gets in the way.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.301
Well, I'm happy to take this on.

05:01.676 --> 05:05.179
This hippo's been known
to skip a rope or two
in her day.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.473
Great.
All right, then.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.101
Let me get myself warmed up!

05:11.352 --> 05:12.270
Ha ha.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.315
Hoppin' hippo,
move your rump.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.067
Hallie's happy
with a rope and a jump!

05:19.777 --> 05:20.611
Whoo.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.071
Yay!
Go, hippo!

05:22.155 --> 05:23.323
Nice jumping,
Hallie.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.074
Ohh. [giggles]

05:25.283 --> 05:27.243
Is all that cheering
for little ol' me?

05:27.869 --> 05:31.372
You're amazing, Hallie.
Now it's Kiko's turn.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.959
As a hopping hippo,
you're pretty good,

05:35.293 --> 05:38.046
but I have a few moves myself.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.006
Step aside.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.008
Let's see what you got.

05:44.218 --> 05:48.389
On three.
One, a two... three!

05:52.435 --> 05:54.729
[groans]

05:54.812 --> 05:56.189
[strains]

05:56.272 --> 05:57.356
You okay?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.775
I don't get it.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.695
I can usually do
all this stuff easy.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.656
I know.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.786
I'll do my big action move
to get myself going again.

06:10.244 --> 06:14.040
I can do that. Ooh-wah!
Hi-- aah!

06:15.666 --> 06:18.044
Um, why don't you show us?

06:18.294 --> 06:19.587
Stand back.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.423
This is how
an action toy does it.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.721
Ooh-- Oh!

06:29.430 --> 06:31.557
Huh. I fall like that
all the time.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.185
[gasps] I must be
an action toy, too.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.063
I-- I can't do it.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.857
There's something wrong
with my legs.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.777
How can I be an action toy

06:43.027 --> 06:47.323
with legs that go all kazooey
every time I use them?

06:47.865 --> 06:49.659
Well, you probably can't,

06:50.368 --> 06:52.787
so we'll just have
to fix your legs.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.497
You can do that?

06:54.997 --> 06:56.833
I may not be an action hero,

06:56.916 --> 06:59.377
but I can fix you up,
no problem.

06:59.752 --> 07:00.795
Cool.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.964

07:36.747 --> 07:38.875
Ooh, can I hear?

07:39.417 --> 07:41.752
Thump, thump.
Thump, thump.
Thump, thump.

07:42.253 --> 07:45.173
That sounds like a heart
ready for action.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.384
It sure does.
Now say, "Ahh."

07:48.843 --> 07:50.803
Ahh-yah!

07:50.887 --> 07:52.180
[giggles]

07:53.931 --> 07:56.726
Cool hammer, Doc.
What are we gonna build?

07:57.226 --> 07:58.603
That's Doc's reflex hammer

07:58.936 --> 08:00.146
to test your reflexes.

08:00.521 --> 08:03.900
Right. And just
to be sure Lambie knows,

08:04.442 --> 08:05.818
what are reflexes, again?

08:05.902 --> 08:09.322
Reflexes are how your muscles
move when they're working right.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.532
See, now she knows.

08:11.866 --> 08:16.162
Just watch out,
'cause my reflexes
are lightning fast.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.248
Uh! See?

08:19.749 --> 08:21.709
Impressive. Ohh!

08:22.376 --> 08:24.378
Let's test your leg reflexes.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.716
Nothing happened.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.427
Well, that's how they do it
in Japan, right?

08:31.677 --> 08:32.678
No.

08:32.970 --> 08:36.432
Stuffy, our bodies are the same
wherever we come from,

08:36.515 --> 08:38.433
and Kiko's leg
should have kicked up.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.436
I need to do one more test.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.355
Kiko, do what I do.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.441
That's easy.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.362
[strains]

08:50.530 --> 08:54.909
It's such a simple move,
but I can't do it.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.619
Poor thing.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.538
I have a diagnosis.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.123
This looks like a case
of weak-muscle-itis.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.627
Now you're talking the language
of the <span style="style.default_1">Big Book of Boo-boos.</span>

09:05.002 --> 09:06.504
That sounds bad.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.215
Is it?

09:09.298 --> 09:13.010
Well, your muscles
are like rubber bands.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.137
If you don't
stretch them enough,

09:15.221 --> 09:17.515
they get weak
and don't work very well.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.518
Oh, dear.
How did it happen, Doc?

09:21.060 --> 09:23.980
Yeah. I've never been
weak before.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.483
Kiko was in her box
all the way from Japan,

09:28.276 --> 09:30.736
so she wasn't able
to move her muscles.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.905
I think they got stiff.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.449
Oh. Well, can you fix her?

09:35.908 --> 09:36.867
Absolutely.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.370
Kiko, first you have to get up

09:39.912 --> 09:41.539
and stretch those muscles.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.584
Show me what to do,
and I'll do it.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.713
Stretch and flex,
stretch and flex,

09:48.796 --> 09:50.006
stretch and flex.

So, how are you feeling?

10:29.545 --> 10:32.048
Like I'm ready for action.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.467
Everyone, stand back.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.260
Whoa!

10:36.344 --> 10:38.512
[Stuffy] I can do that.
Girl power!

10:38.929 --> 10:40.431
[Hallie] Leaping locusts,

10:40.514 --> 10:42.892
she's as limber
as a leopard in a leotard!

10:43.684 --> 10:44.769
[all] Yeah!

10:46.562 --> 10:48.105
Stretching really works.

<span style="style.default_1">Ari-gato gozai-masu.</span>

11:01.035 --> 11:03.287
[gasps] I did it.
I spoke Japanese.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.455
Baa-rilliant.

11:04.538 --> 11:08.292
<span style="style.default_1">Arigato gozaimasu.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Arigato gozaimasu.</span>

11:10.002 --> 11:13.381
I've got business to finish
with those ropes.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.175
Let's see
what your legs can do.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.222
Who-- me?

11:25.851 --> 11:28.354
Looks like you've saved
another toy, Doc.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.398
Nice work.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.899
Thanks, Lambie.

11:31.982 --> 11:32.858
[knocking]

11:32.942 --> 11:33.818
Toys!

11:35.444 --> 11:36.278
Doc?

11:36.654 --> 11:37.655
Hi, Mom.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.073
Your father's working late,

11:39.156 --> 11:42.326
so I thought you,
Donny, and I could go out
for dinner together.

11:42.827 --> 11:43.869
What do you say?

11:43.953 --> 11:45.704
<span style="style.default_1">Arigato gozaimasu.</span>

11:46.038 --> 11:47.039
What does that mean?

11:47.331 --> 11:49.417
It's "thank you"
in Japanese.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.043
Where did you learn that?

11:51.627 --> 11:54.046
Uh, I learned it...

11:55.005 --> 11:56.590
From a new friend.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.551
Ooh, impressive.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.722
Don't be a stranger.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.724
Before we go to dinner,

12:05.808 --> 12:07.935
I have to write Grandma
to thank her.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.105
And, Mom, can we go out
for Japanese food?

12:11.188 --> 12:13.274
[giggles] Sure.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.194
[Doc reads]

12:17.695 --> 12:22.074
My evil plan to take over
McStuffinsville is working.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.743
I've captured the magic teacup,

12:24.994 --> 12:28.122
making me the most powerful
wicked king ever!

12:28.372 --> 12:30.207
[evil laugh]

12:30.666 --> 12:33.836
Hmm, there may be
some superheroes

12:33.919 --> 12:35.588
who just might try

12:35.671 --> 12:37.923
to take back
the magic teacup.

12:38.632 --> 12:39.800
Super Lambie...

12:39.884 --> 12:41.760
and super Stuffy...

12:42.761 --> 12:44.513
Whoa! Ugh.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.559
[both] Ready to get
the magic teacup.

12:49.810 --> 12:53.397
-[giggles]
-And introducing Niles,

12:53.481 --> 12:54.607
my new super sidekick.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.108
Oh. Hi, Niles.

12:56.317 --> 13:00.154
I bandaged the arm of your crane
a while ago, didn't I?

13:00.362 --> 13:01.739
Yep, you sure did, Doc.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.824
I still have
the same bandage.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.743
Really? The same bandage?

13:06.160 --> 13:07.745
That was a long time ago.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.372
Are you sure it doesn't need
to get changed?

13:10.456 --> 13:13.876
It looks kind of dirty
and yicky.

13:13.959 --> 13:14.960
[Niles] Naw, it's okay.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.880
It's probably dirty
because someone left me
behind a bush.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.757
I don't want to mention
any names,

13:19.840 --> 13:22.843
but it rhymes with Lonny.

13:23.093 --> 13:27.223
Bonny? Tonny? Tawonny?
Fonny? Mawonny?

13:27.640 --> 13:28.933
Um, Donny?

13:29.225 --> 13:31.894
Ohh.
Yeah, that makes sense.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.940
Anyway, I was stuck there
until Stuffy found me.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.858
Well, superheroes,

13:38.192 --> 13:40.945
that magic teacup
still needs to be taken back.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.823
So, Super Lambie, Super Stuffy,
and Super Niles,

13:45.366 --> 13:46.534
do your stuff.

13:46.951 --> 13:47.993
Do not fear.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.454
Super Stuffy will get
the magic teacup.

13:50.829 --> 13:54.083
How?
I'm going to fly.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.879
[giggles] But, Stuffy,
you can't fly.

13:59.463 --> 14:00.965
Oh, can't I?

14:01.048 --> 14:03.634
And, please,
it's Super Stuffy.

14:04.176 --> 14:08.764
Yes, I, super Stuffy,
am flying!

14:09.139 --> 14:10.766
Stuffy can fly?

14:11.267 --> 14:13.310
[gasps]
No. Uhh. Whoa!

14:13.978 --> 14:17.731
Aah. No!
The magic teacup!

14:18.732 --> 14:20.192
Uhh. Whoa!

14:20.484 --> 14:21.652
Whoa.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.532
Yeah, nice "flying,"
Super Stuffy.

14:26.615 --> 14:28.075
I see you have some help.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.077
[laughs]

14:30.828 --> 14:33.122
That's pretty cool, guys.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.540
Aw, gee, thanks.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.835
We've been working on this
ever since Stuffy found me.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.838
Yeah. I've always wanted
to fly like a superhero.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.924
And I've always wanted
to be a super sidekick.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.385
Okay, Super Sidekick Niles,

14:46.468 --> 14:48.387
I know we can get
the magic teacup.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.472
Just swing me
a little closer.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.974
You got it.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.393
Whoa. Whoa!

14:56.937 --> 14:59.273
If I bend,
you'll be right there.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.067
[grunts]

15:02.318 --> 15:04.153
Just a little lower.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.155
Oh, no.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.240
-[gasps]
-Ah!

15:09.158 --> 15:11.076
Better let me take a look
at your arm.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.203
It may be that bandage
of yours.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.665
No, no, no, no. It's okay.
[gulps] I'm okay.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.126
Why don't you
let me decide that?

15:19.877 --> 15:22.212
Super Niles, I think
maybe it's time

15:22.296 --> 15:24.423
to change
that old dirty bandage.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.177
Change my bandage?
No. No. No.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.846
I really, really think
the bandage is fine.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.224
So, let's get the teacup.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.060
[grunting]

15:40.397 --> 15:41.941
[gasps] Your bandage!

15:42.191 --> 15:43.776
What's that? Oh, no!

15:44.234 --> 15:47.696
That bandage is looking
super... ew, bad.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.907
The bandage is fine,
Doc, really.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.325
I don't need it changed.

15:51.408 --> 15:54.578
I'm pretty sure it does.
It's old and it--

15:54.662 --> 15:55.621
But I like it.

15:55.704 --> 15:58.207
I'm used to it.
I don't want a new bandage.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.210
Your arm will be
so much better
with a new one.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.588
You can't be a superhero
if you're not super healthy,

16:04.672 --> 16:05.881
so let Doc help you.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.968
Come on. We'll take off
your old dirty bandage

16:09.051 --> 16:10.678
and put on a new one.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.973
But taking off my bandage
will hurt-- a lot.

16:14.723 --> 16:15.641
Won't it?

16:16.475 --> 16:18.143
It'll only hurt
for a second.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.479
And after you have
a new bandage,

16:20.896 --> 16:22.773
you'll be even more super!

16:24.024 --> 16:25.192
Ah! [thud]

16:25.275 --> 16:27.653
I'm good.
Oops. Sorry, Stuffy.

16:28.070 --> 16:28.904
Come on.

16:35.869 --> 16:37.705
The Doc is in.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.294
[giggles]

16:44.378 --> 16:45.587
We have a patient, Hallie.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.633
Well, hello there.
Ooh, a tall guy.

16:49.883 --> 16:53.971
Oh, hi. I'm just trying
to get inside here.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.472
Careful there, stretch!

16:55.556 --> 16:56.974
Scoot left.
Scoot left? Okay.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.517
Now a bit right.
Right?

16:58.600 --> 17:00.227
Duck! Hold still!

17:00.310 --> 17:01.353
There you go.

17:01.854 --> 17:02.813
Did it.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.316
My, oh, my,
your bandage is stickier

17:06.400 --> 17:08.402
than a beehive
at a honey festival.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.156
Mm-mm.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.034
It has been a while
since you've been here.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.578
I say it's checkup time.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.246
[stutters] Checkup time?

17:19.872 --> 17:20.789
Come on back.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.337
Everything seems
great so far.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.257
Now, let's find out
how tall you are.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.802
I just need you
to stand over here
next to the height chart.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.516
Hallie, I think we'll need
to use two charts.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.310
It's looking that way.

17:43.645 --> 17:44.480
Got it!

17:49.359 --> 17:50.360
Chart coming right up.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.072
Mercy, Niles.

17:53.363 --> 17:57.034
You sure are
a tall glass of lemonade.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.744
You're taller than me...

17:59.369 --> 18:00.370
And me...

18:00.454 --> 18:01.288
[both] Together!

18:01.705 --> 18:03.832
Which is perfect
for a crane your age.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.668
So, your basic checkup is over.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.756
Aw, thanks, Doc.
So, I'll, uh, see you outside?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.384
Actually, Niles,
we're not done yet.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.012
-[gulps]
-Don't worry.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.974
Ohh. That's gunky.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.935
I have a diagnosis.

18:23.393 --> 18:26.772
You have a case
of YOB-osis.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.942
YOB-osis?
What's that?

18:30.359 --> 18:33.779
YOB is
yucky old bandage-osis.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.031
That's a good one.
It needs to go

18:36.115 --> 18:37.574
in the <span style="style.default_1">Big Book of Boo-boos.</span>

18:37.825 --> 18:39.118
Here you go, Doc.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.619
Let's see.

18:41.370 --> 18:46.291
Yucky old bandage-osis.

18:47.251 --> 18:50.879
Yucky old bandage-osis
sounds bad. Is it bad, Doc?

18:51.338 --> 18:54.967
No. I'll just need to put
a new clean bandage on you.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.594
Then you'll be
Super Niles again.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.721
Yay, Super Niles...

19:00.013 --> 19:03.600
But, um, how are you gonna
take this old bandage off?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.270
There are two ways
to take off a bandage.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.981
We can slowly peel it off

19:09.439 --> 19:12.109
or quickly rip it off
and that'll be that.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.571
Sugar, I say rip
that bandage off
and move on.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.073
Hallie's right.
Do it fast.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.075
Just be honest, Doc.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.119
How much is it gonna hurt?

to take the old bandage off,

but I'm just not sure
if I want you to go
fast or slow.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.465
What if we just get started
and see what happens?

20:17.966 --> 20:19.843
[gulps] Okay.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.930
You are so brave.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.599
Oh, I agree.
You're the best, stretch.

20:25.849 --> 20:26.975
Oh, thanks.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.645
Stuffy, do something
to distract him.

Super Stuffy flies again!

20:36.026 --> 20:38.612
Oh, good flying, Super Stuffy.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.157
Hmm. I'm really getting
some air here, huh?

20:42.241 --> 20:44.243
[giggles] You are!

20:44.868 --> 20:48.205
Super Stuffy just isn't
the same without you.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.998
Not even close.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.293
Okay, time to say bye-bye
to the old bandage.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.128
Bye-bye. See ya later.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.713
-Adios.
-Bye!

20:56.797 --> 20:57.923
Ta-ta, bandage.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.258
[giggles] Sayonara.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.302
Look what I found.

21:02.719 --> 21:05.430
Wow, it's off?
I hardly felt that.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.266
It really didn't hurt at all.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.685
Good. Ugh.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.603
We'd better clean
all that dirt

21:11.687 --> 21:13.605
that got under the bandage.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.565
Is that bad, Doc?

21:15.857 --> 21:18.277
It's really better
if you keep it clean.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.822
I'm just cleaning
any extra yuck away.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.615
There you go.

21:23.907 --> 21:26.201
Now you're all ready
for a new bandage.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.245
Remember, it's always good

21:28.328 --> 21:30.455
to keep the area
around the bandage clean.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.333
And come back when you need
your bandage changed.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.669
Yeah, make sure you come back

21:35.752 --> 21:38.255
before your bandage
is all yucky, gunky,

21:38.338 --> 21:39.881
skunky, and funky-looking.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.092
[laughter]

21:43.051 --> 21:45.929
<span style="style.default_1">♪ I feel better,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So much better ♪</span>

21:46.263 --> 21:49.141
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Thank you, Doc, for taking</span>
<span style="style.default_1">All the ouches away ♪</span>

21:49.725 --> 21:50.851
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Didn't feel so good</span>

21:50.934 --> 21:53.562
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Till you fixed me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Like I knew that you would ♪</span>

21:54.688 --> 22:00.402
<span style="style.default_1">♪ And I feel better,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So much better now ♪</span>

22:01.069 --> 22:01.903
Ahh.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.116
Thanks, Doc.
Thanks, Hallie.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.660
Now I know that bandages
need to be changed

22:08.744 --> 22:09.953
and kept clean

22:10.412 --> 22:13.123
And changing them
really only hurts
for a second.

22:13.623 --> 22:15.208
Or not at all.
You're right.

22:15.625 --> 22:18.253
I won't wait so long
next time to visit you, Doc,

22:18.337 --> 22:20.005
to make sure my arm is okay.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.757
Let's go, Super Niles.

22:22.215 --> 22:24.134
We still have to stop
the wicked king.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.887
-[all] Duck your head!
-Huh?

22:30.390 --> 22:31.224
Thanks.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.185
Way to go, Super Niles.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.146
[cackles]

22:36.605 --> 22:38.857
I have the magic teacup again.

22:38.940 --> 22:41.610
It's mine, all mine.

22:42.110 --> 22:42.944
[gasps]

22:43.028 --> 22:44.488
-Not so fast!
-Not so fast.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.323
[gasps]

22:47.157 --> 22:49.242
One, two, three!

22:49.451 --> 22:51.286
Whoa... Uhh. Got it!

22:53.747 --> 22:55.415
Way to go!
[Stuffy] we did it.

22:55.499 --> 23:00.128
Super Lambie, Super Stuffy,
and Super Niles save the day.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.880
Yay!
All right!

23:02.255 --> 23:05.258
I'll get that teacup back
one day soon.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.512
You'll see,
or my name's not Percy.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.806
I mean, the Wicked King.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.475
[maniacal laughing]

23:15.727 --> 23:17.145
Really, it's not Percy.

23:18.980 --> 23:22.442
Lambie, Niles, Stuffy,
you're my heroes.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.069
-Wow.
-Thanks.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.571
And, Doc, you're our hero, too.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.323
Thanks, everybody.

23:28.406 --> 23:29.950
-Good stuff.
-Super great.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.038
Hey, everybody.
It's Doc here.

23:35.872 --> 23:38.250
<span style="style.default_1">Bronty has stinky</span>
<span style="style.default_1">brontosaurus breath.</span>

23:38.708 --> 23:41.503
<span style="style.default_1">What should you do</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if you have stinky breath?</span>

23:43.338 --> 23:44.840
<span style="style.default_1">Should you play in the water?</span>

23:47.467 --> 23:48.969
<span style="style.default_1">Ride a plastic horse?</span>

23:51.555 --> 23:53.181
<span style="style.default_1">Or brush your teeth?</span>

23:53.515 --> 23:56.017
<span style="style.default_1">That's right. Brush your teeth.</span>
