02:38.191 --> 02:41.786
I sincerely apologize
for disturbing your afternoon.

02:42.529 --> 02:47.694
If you relax and stay calm,
you will all leave here alive.

02:48.468 --> 02:51.437
We have come only for the girl.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.948
Drop your weapons, Roger Barlow.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.523
Today...

03:19.999 --> 03:21.626
...she will be mine.

03:21.935 --> 03:25.234
I'm talking to a dead man.
You know that, don't you?

03:27.507 --> 03:29.407
If I cannot have her...

03:30.109 --> 03:31.133
No!

03:48.962 --> 03:51.089
Okay, we're gonna see
some old paintings now

03:51.164 --> 03:52.893
...that I think you all will really like.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.331
The Lonely Maiden.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.461
The Lonely Maiden was painted
by Marcel de Robert in 1873.

03:58.605 --> 04:01.904
The girl in the painting is
the artist's own daughter.

04:01.975 --> 04:05.274
Now, marked by assured brush strokes
and the use of fractured light.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.779
...makes this painting a wonderful example
of a very brief.

04:07.847 --> 04:12.750
...but influential time period known as
the Northern French naturalist movement.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.914
- Northern French naturalist movement.
- Northern French...

04:14.988 --> 04:16.148
Ma'am.

04:16.456 --> 04:17.514
I don't mean to interrupt...

04:17.589 --> 04:20.684
...but there are some things
I could clear up for the group.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.920
- May I?
- Oh, no, I think...

04:21.995 --> 04:24.429
Well, first, The Lonely Maiden.

04:25.031 --> 04:29.058
was painted in 1875, not 1873.

04:29.135 --> 04:31.228
And the girl in the painting
is not the artist's daughter...

04:31.304 --> 04:33.329
...but in fact a niece from his wife's side.

04:33.406 --> 04:36.739
Also, the painting technically belongs
to an offshoot.

04:36.809 --> 04:41.269
...of the Northern French naturalist movement.
The post-naturalist movement.

04:41.347 --> 04:44.942
- One of only three works completed.
- Yeah. I knew that.

04:45.018 --> 04:49.079
The Lonely Maiden is marked
by the subtle use of tone and mood.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.590
...to create a striking image
of desperate longing.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.786
...and overwhelming passion.

04:56.396 --> 05:01.732
Sometimes, when you look at her,
the way the light glows on her face...

05:02.835 --> 05:04.928
...the eyes so full of sorrow...

05:05.505 --> 05:08.872
...you cannot help but ask,
"What is she searching for?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.739
"Is there anything I can do for her?

05:19.285 --> 05:21.879
"Is there anything I can do for her?"

05:25.925 --> 05:27.415
- Okay. Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.620
That was a nice treat, wasn't it?
That was neat.

05:29.696 --> 05:30.788
Good to see you.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.663
She looks kind of fat.

05:36.035 --> 05:40.028
- So, Roger, how was your day?
- It was good. How was yours?

05:40.106 --> 05:42.870
Mine? Mine was better than good.

05:43.876 --> 05:47.778
You know how I've been doing Mondays
and Wednesdays down in Margie's shop?

05:47.847 --> 05:51.146
Well, Margie decided they needed
another person on Thursdays.

05:51.217 --> 05:55.654
- And who do you think she called?
- Is this the same soup we usually have?

05:55.755 --> 05:58.121
- Chicken noodle.
- Same brand?

05:58.257 --> 06:01.317
No, they didn't have your brand.
Why? Is it bad?

06:01.394 --> 06:02.827
No, it's just different.

06:02.895 --> 06:08.424
Anyway, today alone
I did seven colorings and six perms.

06:08.501 --> 06:12.562
- It's by far the most I have ever done.
- The noodles stick together in this kind.

06:14.273 --> 06:16.935
I don't know what it is about Thursdays...

06:17.009 --> 06:21.275
...but I made more money in tips today
than I ever have on any Wednesday.

06:21.748 --> 06:26.378
- I was so nervous walking home.
- You know, criminals can sense fear.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.213
Well, I hope no one sensed me today.
I was nervous.

06:32.759 --> 06:35.660
Every little bit gets us closer to Florida.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.396
Our vacation, Roger. Our vacation.

06:42.468 --> 06:45.369
- Who?
- I know you take your job seriously...

06:45.905 --> 06:49.341
...and that's great,
but I really think you need a break.

06:49.876 --> 06:53.573
Someplace warm where you could relax,
take your mind off the museum.

06:53.646 --> 06:56.206
You know what happens
when a security guard relaxes?

06:56.282 --> 06:58.580
I think I have some idea.

07:00.653 --> 07:01.745
Rose.

07:41.527 --> 07:44.428
Monsieur Barlow,
you're supposed to be on break.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.231
Yo, Mr. Barlow,
you're supposed to be on break, man.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.062
Go, get out of here!

07:49.101 --> 07:50.295
Go grab a soda or something, huh?

07:50.369 --> 07:54.100
Okay, but watch out for children.
They like to touch things.

07:54.674 --> 07:58.940
- They get too close, you have to be...
- Yeah, yeah, trust me.

07:59.679 --> 08:01.408
It's under control.

08:03.349 --> 08:06.716
Look sharp, now.
Looks like "The Man" just walked in.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.750
- I wonder what they're doing.
- You didn't hear?

08:15.161 --> 08:17.925
Man, don't you ever read the bulletin board?

08:18.698 --> 08:23.897
The display should be bold, in your face,
grab people by their throats and say...

08:23.970 --> 08:27.030
"I don't care what you think, I am beautiful.

08:27.373 --> 08:31.173
"Do not turn away. " This middle area...

08:32.945 --> 08:35.379
wonderful for the dung sculptures.

08:35.581 --> 08:38.982
The upstairs,
perfect for the series of animal genitalia.

08:39.051 --> 08:41.780
Now, for the northern end of the hall...

08:42.255 --> 08:44.985
- Can I help you with something?
- Yes, sir.

08:45.057 --> 08:47.252
I was wondering, someone told me just now...

08:47.326 --> 08:49.920
...you're thinking of moving
The Lonely Maiden.

08:49.996 --> 08:51.463
Is that true?

08:52.965 --> 08:55.695
- Who is this?
- That would be Barlow, sir.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.798
Security guard, sir.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.898
Well, Mr. Barlow,
I don't know what you've heard...

08:59.972 --> 09:02.406
...but we are not thinking
of moving the exhibit.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.500
We are moving the exhibit.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.512
A gallery in Copenhagen made an offer
and we accepted.

09:08.581 --> 09:13.848
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- Sir! Sir! Why Denmark? Why so far?

09:15.521 --> 09:18.354
I'm sorry we didn't consult you.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.451
The visitor will be greeted
by a series of spirals here.

09:22.528 --> 09:25.019
...in the northern end of the gallery.

09:26.632 --> 09:30.432
It's that damned new curator.
We've had that exhibit 30 years.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.097
People:It needs to be there.

09:34.273 --> 09:37.709
- Roger, were you wearing a beret again?
- No.

09:39.579 --> 09:44.516
But it leaves a big mark on your forehead,
and it pushes your hair up in the back.

09:45.785 --> 09:49.312
I know you like to wear it
when you read your art books.

09:50.389 --> 09:53.654
It doesn't make sense.
People love those paintings.

09:53.793 --> 09:56.284
Maybe they'll like the new exhibit.

10:00.132 --> 10:03.795
Roger, maybe you should retire.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.061
You've been at the museum
an awfully long time.

10:06.138 --> 10:09.835
I can't retire, Rose.
What would I do with myself all day?

10:10.076 --> 10:14.172
Roger, you wouldn't do it with yourself.
You would do it with me.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.979
We could move out of the city,
someplace warm.

10:19.385 --> 10:20.852
I don't know.

10:31.030 --> 10:32.657
- Bob.
- Hey, Roger.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.221
You thought about moving to Denmark?

11:36.295 --> 11:39.389
A little bit, but I don't think
my wife would go for it.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.489
How about you?

11:44.270 --> 11:45.794
Looked into it.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.338
- It just doesn't seem right.
- No.

11:50.109 --> 11:53.738
I mean, you stand there,
day after day, year after year...

11:55.181 --> 11:56.546
...and then...

11:57.750 --> 12:01.117
They say she's going to be gone.
Just like that.

12:13.699 --> 12:14.961
You know...

12:16.635 --> 12:18.967
we don't have to let them leave.

12:19.672 --> 12:23.972
I mean, if we're serious,
we can just make them ours.

12:26.278 --> 12:29.577
- What are you saying?
- What do you think I'm saying?

12:30.549 --> 12:32.016
I'm not sure.

12:32.451 --> 12:36.854
For a second, I thought you were suggesting
that we steal the paintings.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.621
And if I am?

12:38.691 --> 12:41.683
We're security guards.
We're supposed to stop crime.

12:41.761 --> 12:45.390
You don't think this is a crime?
Do you know how far Denmark is?

12:45.464 --> 12:47.329
I don't know, Charlie.

12:49.168 --> 12:53.366
We're not thieves.
And besides, you and me...

12:56.809 --> 12:59.107
I don't see how we could do it.

13:10.189 --> 13:11.884
It's a silly idea.
I shouldn't have brought it up.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.117
- Wait, wait.
- I have to go.

13:13.192 --> 13:17.356
I have things to do. I have responsibilities.
Thanks for the milk.

13:17.429 --> 13:18.521
Sure.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.531
Paintings.

13:26.105 --> 13:27.697
Steal paintings.

14:29.134 --> 14:31.068
- Hi.
- Charles.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.302
Have you thought about
what we talked about yesterday?

14:35.374 --> 14:36.398
No.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.140
Okay, maybe a little bit. Why?

14:40.913 --> 14:42.904
Can I show you something?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.285
About nine months ago
they started this new program.

14:48.354 --> 14:51.687
...of looking at the security tape
from the night before...

14:51.757 --> 14:54.282
...to make sure that the guards on duty
aren't slacking off.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.852
So I volunteered, thinking a few hours
of overtime would help.

15:03.702 --> 15:05.670
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey, fellows.

15:24.089 --> 15:28.549
His name is George McLendon.
He's been a guard for 12 years.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.454
Works nights twice a week.

15:34.533 --> 15:38.060
The statue he's looking at
is called The Bronze Warrior.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.462
Artist unknown.

15:41.307 --> 15:45.368
A vivid and exquisite celebration
of the male form.

15:46.845 --> 15:49.211
The naked male form.

16:14.540 --> 16:15.905
That's him.

16:17.977 --> 16:22.778
- Excuse me. Hello, how are you?
- Good, good. What can I do for you fellows?

16:22.848 --> 16:26.477
My name is Roger Barlow.
This is Charles Peterson.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.643
- Hi.
- We work at the museum.

16:28.721 --> 16:32.020
- Right, I know, I've seen you around.
- Okay, well...

16:34.393 --> 16:35.587
Well...

16:37.796 --> 16:38.888
What?

16:42.368 --> 16:44.563
You're on the security tapes.

16:46.538 --> 16:47.562
So?

16:48.941 --> 16:50.602
- Well...
- Jesus.

16:50.909 --> 16:54.868
- Where's:Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
- George, it's not what you think.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.512
George, George, George, please.

16:57.850 --> 17:02.184
Listen, I don't know what you think you saw,
but I'm a happily married man.

17:02.254 --> 17:07.419
- We're not here to judge you.
- No, we just want to talk about your statue.

17:07.893 --> 17:09.690
We just want to talk.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.865
You know they're moving the exhibit,
don't you?

17:17.935 --> 17:19.800
That's why we're here.

17:21.306 --> 17:23.069
Can we go somewhere?

17:26.278 --> 17:27.869
The coffee shop?

17:31.483 --> 17:35.283
- Do you know how far Denmark is?
- Yes, it's so far away.

17:35.354 --> 17:38.152
- It's too far.
- It's a really hard language.

17:50.602 --> 17:52.797
Hope you don't mind the mess.

17:55.140 --> 17:59.941
- We don't get very many guests.
- That's fine. Did you do all these yourself?

18:00.646 --> 18:03.376
I can pretty much do it from memory now.

18:04.349 --> 18:08.251
The hand sketch on the yellow envelope
over there is my latest.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.922
- I finished it this morning.
- These are amazing.

18:10.989 --> 18:12.320
Thank you.

18:16.061 --> 18:17.824
That must be George.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.297
- Hi, George.
- Charles.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.129
- Roger.
- Hi, George.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.303
I hope you didn't have any trouble
finding the place.

18:28.373 --> 18:31.274
- No.
- Well, if you can just watch your step.

18:31.543 --> 18:34.103
- Cats, see.
- Yeah. Where's the model?

18:35.747 --> 18:37.271
It's over here.

18:37.883 --> 18:39.942
Matisse! Come on, darling.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.651
Bad kitty.

18:44.723 --> 18:49.854
So this is about the best I could do,
in terms of setting up a model for us.

18:51.096 --> 18:52.495
You know, this is the main entrance...

18:52.564 --> 18:55.465
...this is the north entrance,
this is the south entrance.

18:55.534 --> 18:57.798
Well, you know the layout.

18:58.237 --> 19:02.071
I thought the north entrance would be
our best chance. It's quiet and secluded...

19:02.141 --> 19:04.541
...so we won't be spotted from the street.

19:04.610 --> 19:08.876
The door has a triple-action security lock,
controlled electronically...

19:09.047 --> 19:11.481
...and there's only one posted guard.

19:12.317 --> 19:16.276
The guard on duty is permitted
two five-minute bathroom breaks.

19:16.355 --> 19:17.947
...every three hours.

19:19.858 --> 19:23.794
We preset the electronic locks
at a specified time.

19:24.263 --> 19:27.790
Make our way down the corridor
to the main exhibit hall.

19:29.301 --> 19:32.270
What about the two interior guards?

19:42.581 --> 19:44.048
I don't know.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.885
Well, we could always use
the south entrance.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.653
There's only a guard posted there
on the weekends.

19:50.722 --> 19:53.555
The door is an electronically-controlled
bolt lock.

19:53.625 --> 19:57.527
with a magnetic tripwire
that is triggered by opening the door.

19:57.729 --> 19:58.889
There's a three-second delay.

19:59.164 --> 20:05.194
So, if we hurry, we could get inside,
reset it before it activates.

20:05.971 --> 20:09.304
What about the motion sensors?

20:13.478 --> 20:17.608
- Well, I hadn't quite worked that out yet.
- No, I guess you hadn't.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.344
Gentlemen, I have a question for you.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.788
Are you ready to get serious?

20:33.198 --> 20:35.928
- Watch your step.
- You hit me in the face!

20:36.001 --> 20:38.231
- Easy, easy. Use your goggles.
- Be careful.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.203
All right, here we are.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.869
This is something else.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.135
- What a lovely evening.
- Yeah.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.234
- Wow! Look at that!
- Yeah.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.974
Perfect. This is good. This will work.

20:50.282 --> 20:51.977
Are you sure
nobody's gonna come up here?

20:52.050 --> 20:54.280
No, no. Nobody else has a key.

20:55.787 --> 20:57.880
Good. All right, gentlemen.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.858
I'll go first. When I get down...

21:01.727 --> 21:05.322
I'll call for one of you to follow me.
And don't worry.

21:05.397 --> 21:08.389
Once you've attached the rope,
you won't fall.

21:09.067 --> 21:12.434
You do, however,
have to control your speed.

21:13.538 --> 21:17.269
Remember, left hand is the gas,
right hand is the brake.

21:17.342 --> 21:20.004
George, where'd you learn how to do this?

21:20.078 --> 21:23.445
Marines. I was in Wave 3
of the Grenada Invasion.

21:27.919 --> 21:29.386
Wait, wait, wait.

21:33.258 --> 21:35.021
I'm okay. I'm okay.

21:36.428 --> 21:39.625
Charles, you don't care
about these flower pots, do you?

21:39.698 --> 21:41.893
My flowers? Oh, dear.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.699
- Well, I guess not.
- Okay, who's next?

21:48.507 --> 21:51.601
- Roger. Roger, you're next, okay?
- I don't want to do this.

21:51.677 --> 21:55.977
- No, Roger, you've got to. You gotta do it.
- Well, why do I have to go first?

21:56.048 --> 21:58.380
Well, 'cause I don't want to go first.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.884
- Why not?
- Well, because I'm scared.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.011
- I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

22:03.088 --> 22:04.646
Ladies, can we please get a move on?

22:04.723 --> 22:07.988
He's coming. He's coming.
He's coming. He's coming.

22:09.294 --> 22:10.955
You're doing fine.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.865
- You sure about this?
- Of course I'm sure.

22:20.939 --> 22:22.736
Let her rip, soldier!

22:24.976 --> 22:27.672
- Good luck, Roger.
- Okay, here goes.

22:38.056 --> 22:39.648
Roger, you okay?

22:39.958 --> 22:41.425
I'm not sure.

22:41.493 --> 22:44.223
You're doing fine, Private.
The hard part's behind you.

22:44.296 --> 22:47.356
Just remember, left hand gas,
right hand brake.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.994
- I think my hand is slipping.
- Which one?

22:50.068 --> 22:51.160
Both.

22:55.841 --> 22:57.604
Roger, are you okay?

22:59.177 --> 23:01.407
I can't believe it. I'm alive.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.385
Rose, I've been thinking about
what you said, you know...

23:13.458 --> 23:16.723
...about me retiring
and us moving somewhere.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.027
Maybe it's not such a bad idea.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.089
Roger, really?

23:24.669 --> 23:26.603
Roger, that's wonderful.

23:26.671 --> 23:28.662
I knew,
once you wrapped your mind around it...

23:28.740 --> 23:34.076
...that Florida would be the place for us.
All of those beaches and sunshine.

23:35.213 --> 23:38.341
As nice as Florida is,
I was thinking Denmark.

23:40.719 --> 23:41.981
- Denmark?
- Yeah.

23:42.053 --> 23:43.611
Are you kidding?

23:43.688 --> 23:47.920
I realize it's not a conventional choice,
but I've heard nice things.

23:49.227 --> 23:53.095
Are there beaches in Denmark?
Does it even get warm there?

23:53.799 --> 23:57.633
Not like Florida, no,
but probably there's a few weeks a year.

23:57.702 --> 24:01.001
...that are very pleasant.
I'm not sure about a beach.

24:02.107 --> 24:05.406
Roger, that sounds like
a great place to retire.

24:08.814 --> 24:10.281
I can't wait.

24:11.216 --> 24:14.652
Yeah, well,
I thought it might be something different.

24:14.719 --> 24:17.347
- It's different.
- Yeah.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.885
- Where's Charles?
- He said he'd be here.

25:31.596 --> 25:34.292
Sorry I'm late. I went to the wrong bench.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.767
- The gentleman over there...
- Turn around, turn around.

25:37.836 --> 25:41.897
We have to be extra careful now.
No telling who might be watching.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.270
There's a new plan.

25:45.143 --> 25:48.203
We're going to take the pieces
during the move.

25:51.016 --> 25:55.453
- But won't there be guards?
- We are the guards. Tell him, Roger.

25:55.854 --> 25:58.948
Needlebaum's taking volunteers
to work security.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.852
If we volunteer,
we'll have perfect access to the pieces.

26:04.996 --> 26:09.057
- How do you know that?
- I snuck into his office and read the file.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.592
- You did?
- Yeah.

26:12.604 --> 26:14.401
Roger, I'm impressed.

26:15.106 --> 26:16.835
- Thank you, Charlie.
- All right.

26:16.908 --> 26:19.741
We should move on.
This is starting to look suspicious.

26:19.811 --> 26:23.076
I'll keep you men informed
on a need-to-know basis.

26:23.481 --> 26:25.574
George, George, wait! Wait!

26:27.419 --> 26:28.784
What is it?

26:29.087 --> 26:31.021
You said we're gonna steal the pieces
during the move.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.058
What happens when the crates are opened
in Denmark and three pieces are missing?

26:34.125 --> 26:35.114
That's a good point.

26:35.193 --> 26:36.854
Would you please turn around?
They're gonna see us.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.988
- Who's "they"? We're at the park.
- Gentlemen...

26:48.206 --> 26:52.609
Gentlemen, let me ask you a question.
Do the Communists control Grenada?

26:54.713 --> 26:57.705
I am not that familiar with Grenada. Do they?

26:58.016 --> 27:00.814
Hell no, they don't, and do you know why?

27:00.885 --> 27:03.615
- Because you invaded?
- Exactly.

27:04.623 --> 27:10.061
Operation Urgent Fury was a shining beacon
of military preparedness.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.825
So when you ask me what happens
when three pieces are missing in Denmark...

27:13.898 --> 27:17.163
...it offends me.
It's like you discount my training.

27:17.502 --> 27:20.335
I'm sorry, George.
I didn't mean to doubt your training.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.396
- Thank you, I appreciate that.
- But seriously...

27:22.474 --> 27:25.238
what happens when three pieces
are found missing in Denmark?

27:25.310 --> 27:26.641
All right.

27:27.846 --> 27:32.340
Since the phrase "on a need-to-know basis"
clearly means nothing to you...

27:36.554 --> 27:40.752
we are going to have
three perfect fakes made.

27:46.031 --> 27:48.090
But that's not the same, is it?

27:48.166 --> 27:50.532
I thought the whole point
was to get the real pieces.

27:50.602 --> 27:51.967
- Yes.
- No.

27:52.337 --> 27:56.171
No, we're gonna get...
We're going to get the real pieces...

27:56.508 --> 28:00.740
...but we'll exchange the fakes for the originals
during the move.

28:00.812 --> 28:04.942
That way, when they open the crates
in Denmark, no one's the wiser.

28:08.019 --> 28:13.821
- Charles. Can you handle the paintings?
- Well, sure, but what about your statue?

28:13.892 --> 28:16.156
I'm not a sculptor. I don't do sculpture.

28:16.227 --> 28:18.718
I've had something in the works
for quite some time.

28:18.797 --> 28:21.857
A few more adjustments,
and it'll be just fine.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.266
You really got this figured out, George.

28:27.572 --> 28:30.132
Operation Urgent Fury, gentlemen.

28:31.276 --> 28:33.471
Operation Urgent Fury.

28:34.612 --> 28:38.639
We sign up to work the move on Friday.
I trust you'll be there.

28:59.504 --> 29:02.234
- Charles, that's really good.
- Thank you.

29:04.309 --> 29:06.573
- Would you like to see yours?
- Is it done?

29:06.644 --> 29:08.771
Well, just a few finishing touches.

29:08.847 --> 29:10.439
- Of course.
- Come on.

29:16.621 --> 29:18.282
What do you think?

29:25.396 --> 29:27.057
You don't like it.

29:30.301 --> 29:32.895
I think it's a pretty good likeness, Roger.

29:32.971 --> 29:34.700
Maybe if it had a frame.
You could see it a little better...

29:34.773 --> 29:36.707
No, no, it's all wrong.
The face, the body, Charles.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.174
- She looks like a pear.
- A pear?

29:38.243 --> 29:40.677
- Look at the size of her face, it's huge.
- What are you talking about?

29:40.745 --> 29:42.610
It's called "voluptuous. " And the hair...

29:42.680 --> 29:45.615
...it's supposed to be long,
flowing, windswept.

29:45.717 --> 29:46.945
What about the glow?

29:47.018 --> 29:49.816
- Charlie, this girl has no glow!
- Roger...

29:50.088 --> 29:52.022
- Look at the size of her jaw!
- I can only paint what I see...

29:52.090 --> 29:54.217
...and that's the way I see it!

29:54.659 --> 29:57.253
The jaw, with the hips, what is that?

29:57.362 --> 30:00.695
- I'm not a Xerox machine, Roger!
- She looks like a Neanderthal!

30:00.765 --> 30:03.199
- Got a jaw like a Cro-Magnon!
- Roger.

30:03.701 --> 30:05.168
- I'm sorry.
- I paint the way I feel...

30:05.236 --> 30:07.170
...and that's the way
your woman makes me feel!

30:07.238 --> 30:09.035
But then how come yours is perfect?

30:09.107 --> 30:13.100
Because I've had a lot of practice,
that's why. Almost 30 years.

30:14.779 --> 30:20.945
And it's not perfect. It's not perfect at all.
There's a:There's an aura.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.214
I can't seem to capture.

30:26.024 --> 30:28.686
I mean, I've tried.
I've tried over and over and over...

30:28.760 --> 30:30.489
...and I just can't...

30:32.530 --> 30:34.191
It just eludes me.

30:38.136 --> 30:41.264
Roger, I'm sorry.

30:56.988 --> 30:58.182
That...

30:59.991 --> 31:03.017
Probably my wife. Could we take two?

31:09.000 --> 31:10.991
- George here.
- It's Roger.

31:11.169 --> 31:14.161
I thought I said
we'd only use this number for emergencies.

31:14.239 --> 31:17.697
This is an emergency.
Charlie couldn't do the painting.

31:18.610 --> 31:19.872
What do you mean he couldn't do it?

31:19.944 --> 31:23.402
Roger, this is a vital part of the plan.
Without this, everything falls to pieces!

31:23.481 --> 31:25.915
Trust me, George, it was terrible.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.876
- How did his look?
- His looked great.

31:29.954 --> 31:33.287
What am I gonna do, George?
I don't know anybody else who paints.

31:33.358 --> 31:35.758
All right, relax, soldier, relax.

31:35.827 --> 31:38.887
Look, the art world has a long tradition
of young painters doing forgeries.

31:38.963 --> 31:42.922
...to make ends meet. Some of our
greatest artists got their start that way.

31:43.001 --> 31:46.903
And if there's one thing that this city has,
it's lots of starving artists.

31:46.971 --> 31:49.496
- It'll cost you some coin, though.
- How much coin?

31:49.574 --> 31:52.475
I don't know. A couple of hundred, probably.

31:53.678 --> 31:56.374
- That's a lot of money.
- Roger, listen.

31:56.881 --> 31:59.679
You've got to get something done.
Otherwise...

32:00.485 --> 32:03.079
Well, the whole mission is fubared.

32:03.821 --> 32:05.288
Okay, George.

33:02.747 --> 33:04.112
Something I can help you with?

33:04.182 --> 33:07.345
Hi. I'm admiring your work.
It's good, I like it.

33:08.419 --> 33:09.579
Thanks.

33:09.654 --> 33:13.556
How would you feel about doing some work
on a kind of commission basis?

33:13.624 --> 33:18.220
It's for my wife. It's a gift,
and it needs to be identical, actual size...

33:18.696 --> 33:21.324
with the artist's signature
in the exact same place.

33:21.399 --> 33:24.664
- My wife's a stickler for details.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

33:25.069 --> 33:27.401
- When do you need it?
- Five days.

33:28.539 --> 33:30.439
This mean you'll do it?

33:30.942 --> 33:33.240
Yeah, sure. For 1,000 bucks.

33:33.745 --> 33:37.647
- $500 now, the rest when you pick it up.
- But that's expensive.

33:38.049 --> 33:39.141
Okay.

33:41.319 --> 33:42.411
$500.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.016
Got it right here.

33:53.398 --> 33:55.127
Quiet down, please.

33:57.535 --> 34:02.700
Sector 3 will be the first to be moved,
starting from the north wall moving south.

34:03.007 --> 34:06.374
The museum has been divided
into color-coded sectors...

34:06.477 --> 34:09.002
...and each painting assigned a number.

34:09.981 --> 34:13.348
Each piece is to be placed
in the crate and slot.

34:13.684 --> 34:18.553
...designated by its color code and number,
then marked off of a checklist...

34:18.623 --> 34:21.420
...then double-checked off of a master list.

34:22.693 --> 34:27.426
The rest of the week will be dedicated
to the installation of the new exhibit.

34:27.598 --> 34:30.293
Now, the curator has written a few words...

34:35.606 --> 34:37.005
Hello, Rose?

34:54.391 --> 34:55.882
There you are.

34:58.696 --> 35:01.221
I didn't think you were here.
I yelled when I came in...

35:01.299 --> 35:03.290
...but you didn't answer.

35:07.872 --> 35:10.033
There's $800 missing.

35:14.879 --> 35:16.847
Think we've been robbed?

35:18.716 --> 35:22.208
What about the stereo?
Did you check the rest of the apartment?

35:22.286 --> 35:25.449
- Is the TV still here?
- We weren't robbed, Roger.

35:25.756 --> 35:28.748
That's all that was missing.
No more, no less.

35:29.827 --> 35:34.059
I came home, I opened the jar
to put in my tips from the store.

35:34.132 --> 35:37.363
- And do my weekly count.
- I thought you did a monthly count.

35:37.435 --> 35:41.132
No, Roger, I do a weekly count.
I've always done a weekly count...

35:41.205 --> 35:45.539
...and this week we're $800 lower
than last week.

35:46.010 --> 35:47.477
That's weird.

35:47.545 --> 35:50.708
- I should check the stereo, just in case.
- Roger.

35:50.781 --> 35:53.875
If you wanted money,
why wouldn't you just ask me?

35:53.951 --> 35:56.715
We would've worked something out.
But to steal?

35:56.787 --> 36:00.086
- Why would I take it?
- That's what I'd like to know.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.118
You don't gamble.

36:02.460 --> 36:06.123
You don't go to bars.
You're not seeing another woman.

36:06.197 --> 36:07.221
How do you know?

36:07.298 --> 36:09.425
All right, Roger,
are you seeing another woman?

36:09.500 --> 36:13.300
No, of course not, but how do you know
I don't gamble, go to bars?

36:13.371 --> 36:16.363
Maybe I drink and gamble.
Maybe that's my thing.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.738
Hey, why am I the one to blame?

36:18.943 --> 36:22.401
Money gets stolen
and you automatically accuse me!

36:22.580 --> 36:24.070
How do I know you didn't take the money?

36:24.148 --> 36:25.240
- Me?
- Yeah.

36:25.416 --> 36:29.352
How could you, Roger?
I'm your wife! Your wife!

36:29.420 --> 36:31.945
- You accused me!
- Well, this money, Roger...

36:32.023 --> 36:35.117
...this money was for us! Together!

36:35.860 --> 36:39.125
To think that I would steal
from my own cookie jar!

36:39.230 --> 36:40.322
Okay.

36:42.099 --> 36:43.191
Rose.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.835
- Beast!
- Rose!

36:49.407 --> 36:50.738
I'm sorry!

36:52.343 --> 36:53.970
I didn't mean it.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.772
Rose.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.740
Come on, Rose.

37:34.318 --> 37:36.878
You know I don't like it
when you're mad at me.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.478
Go away, Roger.

37:40.458 --> 37:43.154
Okay, I admit I took the money.

37:44.462 --> 37:47.363
Look, I wasn't gonna say anything, 'cause...

37:49.233 --> 37:53.499
It was supposed to be a surprise,
but you kind of forced my hand here.

37:55.906 --> 37:57.396
I'm listening.

37:58.342 --> 38:02.335
Remember how we talked about
maybe taking that trip to Florida?

38:10.254 --> 38:11.312
Yes.

38:14.158 --> 38:17.286
Well, again,
it was supposed to be a surprise...

38:17.361 --> 38:20.228
...but I went to a travel agent
and I booked us a trip.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.698
I needed the money for a deposit.

38:23.067 --> 38:25.297
We're going to Florida? When?

38:25.569 --> 38:29.562
Well, that's where it gets complicated.
I was thinking next week, but...

38:29.640 --> 38:32.336
Our anniversary? Roger, you remembered?

38:35.112 --> 38:36.636
You remembered.

38:37.948 --> 38:40.075
I thought you had forgotten.

38:40.551 --> 38:44.282
I didn't forget.
I was all over it, but then it got complicated.

38:44.355 --> 38:45.947
How complicated?

38:48.092 --> 38:52.426
Remember I told you
they're moving the exhibit next week?

38:53.631 --> 38:54.689
Yes.

38:54.765 --> 38:56.892
They put together a special security crew...

38:56.967 --> 39:01.165
...and my supervisor says they need me.
It's an important assignment, and...

39:01.238 --> 39:02.705
The whole thing's out of my hands now...

39:02.773 --> 39:06.231
...but it looks like we have to postpone Florida
for another time.

39:06.310 --> 39:09.746
Wait a minute.
So we're not going to Florida?

39:10.081 --> 39:12.208
One minute you tell me
we're going to Florida...

39:12.283 --> 39:16.913
- Then you tell me we're not going to Florida?
- I hate to disappoint you. Rose!

39:16.987 --> 39:20.354
I wasn't going to say anything,
'cause I know how you get your hopes up...

39:20.424 --> 39:23.018
...but then you noticed the money and...

39:23.260 --> 39:25.820
I should talk to that travel agent,
get our deposit back.

39:25.896 --> 39:28.490
We're going, we're not going.
We're going, we're not going.

39:28.566 --> 39:30.056
We're going, we're going.

39:53.824 --> 39:55.052
Come in.

39:57.194 --> 40:01.722
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes. Come in, Roger. Have a seat.

40:04.301 --> 40:05.632
Hi, Roger.

40:06.303 --> 40:08.533
Rose, what are you doing here?

40:08.739 --> 40:13.836
Your lovely wife was just telling me that
you're planning on taking a trip next week.

40:14.011 --> 40:15.239
Is that right?

40:15.312 --> 40:17.473
Well, there was something
I had been planning.

40:17.548 --> 40:21.609
- It was supposed to be a surprise.
- Well, I was just explaining:Sit down.

40:21.685 --> 40:25.951
I was just explaining to the lovely
Mr. Needlebaum about the surprise.

40:26.590 --> 40:30.424
You know, Roger,
working this move isn't mandatory.

40:31.796 --> 40:33.991
You didn't have to volunteer.

40:34.665 --> 40:38.431
- Volunteer?
- I understand, Mr. Needlebaum.

40:39.170 --> 40:43.129
I guess I got confused. I wasn't quite sure
what you meant by "voluntary. "

40:43.207 --> 40:47.007
Sometimes when people say "voluntary,"
they mean "mandatory. "

40:47.545 --> 40:48.739
Really?

40:49.079 --> 40:52.537
No, I actually meant voluntary.

40:53.317 --> 40:57.617
If you two are planning a vacation,
I'll find somebody to take your place.

40:57.688 --> 40:59.315
Consider it done.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.687
- That's good.
- Roger!

41:04.795 --> 41:06.456
So where are you two going?

41:06.530 --> 41:09.897
Roger is taking me to Florida
for our anniversary.

41:10.568 --> 41:14.026
You old dog, you.
I didn't know you were that romantic.

41:15.673 --> 41:18.471
Florida? What's this thing about Florida?

41:19.143 --> 41:20.906
I can't help it. Rose thinks we're going.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.138
- Who's Rose? Your wife?
- Yeah.

41:22.213 --> 41:24.204
- Why does she think that?
- I told her we were.

41:24.281 --> 41:25.771
- You told her you were going?
- It's a long story!

41:25.850 --> 41:27.010
Did you know about this?

41:27.084 --> 41:31.282
No, I didn't know about it. I just found out.
Why are we having this emergency meeting?

41:31.355 --> 41:34.722
Well, Roger, we can't have you going AWOL.
Not now.

41:34.792 --> 41:36.953
We've done too much planning.
You're gonna go to Needlebaum...

41:37.027 --> 41:38.756
...you tell him
there's been a big misunderstanding.

41:38.829 --> 41:40.558
You're not going on any trip.

41:40.631 --> 41:42.792
You tell him to put you back on the list.
He'll understand.

41:42.867 --> 41:44.391
Well, what about Rose?
What am I going to tell her?

41:44.468 --> 41:48.165
- Hey, man. I can't complain. I'm all right.
- How you doing?

41:54.645 --> 41:56.772
Hey, who's working the move?

41:59.650 --> 42:02.710
Kind of sick of looking
at the same old junk around here, huh?

42:02.786 --> 42:04.754
Yeah, it'll be a relief.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.355
Well, take care, fellows.

42:08.425 --> 42:10.188
- Okay, man.
- See you.

42:13.697 --> 42:16.359
- Roger, we can't do it without you.
- Let me ask you something.

42:16.433 --> 42:19.027
- Who calls the shots in your house?
- I do, but she's not going to like this.

42:19.103 --> 42:22.470
She doesn't have to like it.
Women respond to authority and leadership.

42:22.540 --> 42:25.134
They may say they don't, but they do.

42:25.242 --> 42:26.766
Your wife responds to that?

42:26.844 --> 42:27.833
- Who?
- Yours.

42:27.912 --> 42:31.313
My wife has nothing to do with this.
We are talking about his wife.

42:31.415 --> 42:32.882
Come on, man.

42:33.484 --> 42:35.577
- Stand up! Be a man.
- I do!

42:37.555 --> 42:40.422
- Charlie, what's with him?
- I don't...

42:46.163 --> 42:49.724
Rose, that's the way it's gonna be.
We're not going.

42:50.100 --> 42:54.264
That's the way it's gonna be.
What? You want to argue with me? Okay.

42:54.538 --> 42:58.235
That's it. That's the way it's going to be.
It's final.

43:01.946 --> 43:03.277
That's it.

43:16.560 --> 43:20.018
Hey, Roger, your guy did a great job.

43:20.097 --> 43:21.724
That looks exactly the same.

43:21.799 --> 43:26.862
There's something missing. The glow.
And she's clearly not as lonely in this one.

43:26.937 --> 43:29.428
- Yeah, and mine's missing something, too.
- No, no, no, no, no, guys.

43:29.506 --> 43:31.474
Of course they don't look perfect for us.

43:31.542 --> 43:35.205
We've stood in front of the real pieces
for months! Years!

43:35.713 --> 43:39.012
We've come to know them in ways that
the average person will never understand.

43:39.083 --> 43:41.881
Look at the:Look at the Bronze Warrior.

43:41.952 --> 43:45.718
Look at the sense of power,
the feeling of potency.

43:46.624 --> 43:51.323
The abs. And yet,
this is no substitute for the original.

43:51.929 --> 43:55.729
It's not important how they make us feel.
What's important.

43:56.500 --> 44:00.334
...is whether some guy in Denmark
is going to recognize them as fakes!

44:00.404 --> 44:01.496
Yeah.

44:03.607 --> 44:05.097
- We go?
- We go.

44:15.586 --> 44:19.215
It's 6:40 a. M.,
and you're tuned to Boston's All-Talk Radio.

44:19.490 --> 44:23.187
It's a brisk 44 degrees out there,
with lots of sunshine...

44:37.274 --> 44:39.708
- Hi, Bob.
- A little early, aren't you?

44:39.777 --> 44:41.267
Got a big day.

46:47.838 --> 46:50.636
You know, there's only so much I can say.

46:53.577 --> 46:55.204
- Yeah, so...
- Hey!

46:55.379 --> 47:00.840
I thought you were:I was looking at...
Never mind, never mind. I'm losing my mind!

47:09.393 --> 47:11.156
Woman Reading. C-21.

47:22.472 --> 47:24.064
This one's fine.

47:56.073 --> 47:58.598
Let's carry Mother and Child over...

48:13.891 --> 48:17.258
Looks like this is C-21.

48:17.327 --> 48:19.056
- Got it.
- It's good.

48:19.596 --> 48:20.858
Watch it.

48:34.544 --> 48:36.444
Who's taking care of...

48:41.051 --> 48:42.416
We're good.

49:36.206 --> 49:37.230
Damn it!

49:39.409 --> 49:43.846
Phil, would you mind finishing
these last few for me?

49:43.914 --> 49:46.747
I've been at it all day. I need a break.

49:47.751 --> 49:49.412
Sure thing, Roger.

50:04.701 --> 50:08.228
- I'm here.
- Charlie. I'm glad to see you.

50:29.426 --> 50:30.620
George?

50:36.800 --> 50:39.462
- What took you so long?
- I'm sorry, I couldn't get away.

50:39.536 --> 50:41.527
- How you doing in there?
- I'm all right.

50:41.638 --> 50:43.902
I bought this for you
at the vending machine.

50:43.974 --> 50:49.276
- I thought you might get hungry later.
- Roger, I've been trained to endure hardship.

50:49.679 --> 50:52.842
In Nam, soldiers would go for days
in the jungle without food.

50:52.916 --> 50:55.817
I thought you said
you were in the Grenada Invasion?

50:55.886 --> 50:57.217
No, I'm...

51:00.657 --> 51:04.218
- How's the paintings?
- They're right here. Everything's fine.

51:04.294 --> 51:06.489
Let's try this one more time.

51:08.832 --> 51:12.268
Blue Dragon, this is Red Dragon.
Come in, Blue Dragon.

51:13.103 --> 51:15.970
- George, about these code names...
- Roger!

51:16.239 --> 51:19.766
- Lf we're gonna do this thing, let's do it right.
- Yeah.

51:20.844 --> 51:23.312
Blue Dragon, this is Red Dragon.
Come in, Blue Dragon.

51:23.380 --> 51:26.008
Copy, Red Dragon. This is Blue Dragon.

51:26.783 --> 51:29.980
- Affirmative.
- Don't forget these.

51:31.855 --> 51:33.618
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

51:36.460 --> 51:38.690
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Roger.

51:38.895 --> 51:39.987
What?

51:41.998 --> 51:43.090
What?

51:43.633 --> 51:48.195
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, yeah. Get this lid on, but be quiet.

51:48.638 --> 51:50.196
Keep it quiet!

52:08.892 --> 52:11.224
Red Dragon. Come in, Red Dragon.

52:12.262 --> 52:14.230
What is it, Blue Dragon?

52:14.397 --> 52:19.391
Red Dragon, it just occurred to me.
I don't think I can get you onto the cart.

52:19.836 --> 52:22.236
It's too heavy with you in there.

52:33.783 --> 52:36.217
I'm sorry, it just occurred to me.

52:37.387 --> 52:39.582
- Here, let me...
- I've got it.

52:43.827 --> 52:44.987
Quiet.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.395
Come on.

52:54.771 --> 52:57.239
We need somebody...
We need somebody else to help.

52:57.307 --> 52:59.502
There's nobody else. Come on.

52:59.976 --> 53:02.274
Now, wait, wait, wait a second.

53:04.014 --> 53:05.845
- Okay...
- No, this is no good.

53:05.916 --> 53:09.352
What if we maybe get...
Well, we have to get over here.

53:11.655 --> 53:13.680
- What do we do now?
- Okay, just push it.

53:13.757 --> 53:16.487
- Okay, okay...
- Put it down. Put it down.

53:19.229 --> 53:23.165
- With the arthritis, it's very hard.
- It's all right. What we need to do...

53:23.233 --> 53:26.396
Leverage. We need some sort of a lever.

53:26.703 --> 53:28.330
Okay, okay, okay.

53:30.407 --> 53:32.307
Right. Push.

53:46.756 --> 53:48.189
Just push it.

53:48.525 --> 53:50.618
All right, bring over A-19.

53:53.530 --> 53:56.624
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? You guys still got more?

53:56.700 --> 53:59.498
Yes. This one is part of a special collection.

53:59.569 --> 54:02.936
A couple of pieces had to be wrapped
separately. It took a little longer.

54:03.006 --> 54:06.339
- Okay, pops, we'll get it from here.
- It's kind of heavy.

54:06.409 --> 54:07.740
- Hey, Pauly!
- Yo!

54:07.811 --> 54:10.245
Come here a minute.
Give me a hand with this, would you?

54:10.313 --> 54:12.804
Come on, get over on the end here.

54:13.883 --> 54:16.078
- I can help.
- No, no, no, you're all right.

54:16.152 --> 54:17.176
- You just take it easy, pops.
- Thanks.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.484
Me and Pauly's got it. Get it.

54:19.789 --> 54:22.485
- Yeah, it's really heavy.
- Jesus Christ!

54:22.826 --> 54:25.488
Here, put it down! Put it down!
Put it down! Yeah!

54:25.996 --> 54:28.328
- Wow! Yeah.
- Get the pallet jack.

54:30.300 --> 54:32.530
- What'd you say was in this?
- It's a special collection.

54:32.602 --> 54:35.230
It's a few different pieces, actually.

54:36.539 --> 54:39.508
- That'll do it.
- Thank you. Get somebody else...

54:39.576 --> 54:41.840
- I can help.
- No, no, not you! I mean, no offense.

54:41.911 --> 54:44.277
I mean, I'm sure you could lift it,
but we got guys who do this.

54:44.347 --> 54:45.780
- We're professionals.
- I'm not as old as I look.

54:45.849 --> 54:46.975
I'm not calling you old.

54:47.050 --> 54:49.780
I know I said "old man,"
I didn't mean "old man. "

54:49.853 --> 54:52.287
- All right, thank you. Thank you very much.
- Sure thing.

54:52.355 --> 54:55.119
- Come to me.
- Are you going to put it here in this room?

54:55.191 --> 54:56.783
It's a warehouse, right?
That's where we're gonna put it.

54:56.860 --> 54:58.020
- But this room?
- Yeah.

54:58.094 --> 55:00.358
- Over here someplace. Good.
- Yeah, right in the room.

55:00.430 --> 55:02.193
With the other stuff.
We're all set. Thank you very much.

55:02.265 --> 55:04.563
- All set.
- Okay. Good, good, good.

55:04.634 --> 55:06.727
- Bye. Thank you.
- Thank you.

55:09.973 --> 55:11.463
Down this end.

56:21.544 --> 56:25.640
This is Red Dragon. Start your watches.
All clear. I'm coming out now.

56:31.888 --> 56:33.617
Blue Dragon, check.

56:38.228 --> 56:40.025
Yellow Dragon, check.

56:54.811 --> 56:57.245
I'm starting with Yellow Dragon's.

56:57.814 --> 57:01.113
Young Girl With Cats. C-09.

57:13.763 --> 57:14.957
Got it.

57:51.434 --> 57:53.527
- I've got her.
- That's good.

57:54.671 --> 57:58.732
- How does she look?
- She looks fine. I'm making the switch now.

58:00.877 --> 58:04.074
And the cats? What about the cats?
Do they look good?

58:06.316 --> 58:09.513
They look fine. Now, will you please shut up
and let me work?

58:09.586 --> 58:14.523
Sorry, but be careful, okay?
She's very delicate.

58:38.948 --> 58:42.543
One painting down.
Seven minutes, 27 seconds.

58:43.219 --> 58:45.119
Blue Dragon, you're up.

58:45.388 --> 58:47.754
The Lonely Maiden. B-12.

58:49.058 --> 58:51.026
B-12. Roger.

58:51.327 --> 58:53.318
- What?
- What?

58:54.297 --> 58:56.265
The Lonely Maiden, B-12.

58:56.966 --> 58:58.490
B-12, I got it.

59:23.793 --> 59:28.662
Okay, Dragons, 21 minutes down.
T- Minus 34 until the next patrol.

59:30.567 --> 59:33.968
Next up, Bronze Warrior. C-22.

59:34.804 --> 59:36.362
C-22.

59:36.673 --> 59:39.471
Roger. I mean, I understand. I've got it.

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:07.120
George? George?

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:12.031
George, where are you?
George, come in, please.

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:17.633
George? George? George!

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:22.200
What's going on?
I'm trying to concentrate down here.

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:26.339
- And why aren't you calling me Red Dragon?
- I'm sorry. Red Dragon.

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:27.505
We have a Code 3.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:33.349
Code 3? No, no, no.
That guard isn't due for another 12 minutes!

01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:36.391
I know it! I know! I am looking right at him!

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:39.895
- It's a definite Code 3!
- Oh, my God! Where is he?

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:42.423
Sector 3, north hallway!

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:45.233
Hurry, George, hurry!
He'll be there in a minute!

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:47.859
Charles, George, what's happening?

01:01:48.304 --> 01:01:51.239
It's the patrol guard. He's come back early.

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:55.044
- What guy? The big guy with the hair?
- That new guy.

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:56.544
He's really mean!

01:01:56.612 --> 01:02:00.776
George, he's in the northeast gallery now.
Hurry up, George!

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:10.252
He's on his way down, George.

01:02:11.627 --> 01:02:14.323
George, he's getting into the elevator!

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:32.877
George, where are you?
He's coming your way! He's off the elevator!

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:33.938
He's coming your way!

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:47.429
Hurry! Hurry!

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:55.336
He's 20 feet away, George! He's 20 feet away!

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:03.942
Hide, George! Hide! Hide! Hide!

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.310
George, are you there? George?

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:17.980
George?

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:23.651
Yeah, I'm still here.
Everything's okay. He didn't see me.

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:28.696
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.037
Okay, Dragons, that's it.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:43.442
- And Yellow Dragon?
- Yes, George?

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.436
Don't be late.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.078
Don't worry, George. I won't.

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:51.982
- Good night, Roger.
- Good night, Charles.

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:27.212
Back, back, back, back, back. A little more.

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:35.690
- Hey, Roger.
- Bob.

01:06:21.944 --> 01:06:23.002
Sir.

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:36.788
I just want to keep on top of this guy...

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:39.953
Red Dragon, Red Dragon.
Come in, Red Dragon.

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:45.097
Blue Dragon, what are you doing? We're
supposed to suspend communications.

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:47.067
It's too risky. Someone could hear you.

01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:50.936
Listen to me. We have a problem.
I don't know which crate you're in.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:54.374
They took the inventory list,
and all the crates look the same.

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:59.239
Relax, Blue Dragon, there's nothing
to worry about. I noticed it last night.

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:01.074
What's your current position?

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:04.950
North end of the storeroom.
I'm looking at the crates right now.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:08.582
Good. I'm facing north.
You're looking right at me.

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:13.455
There's a row of four crates,
and then a second row of four crates.

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:16.264
I'm in the first row, third box from the left.

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:19.859
Okay, okay, third box from the left. I got you.

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:29.704
Not horses! Oh, dear.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.605
Hey, that looks like B-07.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.054
Right here.

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:45.490
- You sure you got it?
- I got it.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:52.892
- Barlow, what do you got there?
- Special collection, sir.

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:56.398
Van 3, Barlow. Van 3.

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:02.569
Oh, no. Come on, horsey.
Giddyup. Giddyup!

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:24.532
Hey, Mr. Barlow!

01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:28.261
Ain't you supposed to be on vacation?

01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:30.430
That got changed.

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:34.941
- You need some help?
- No. I'm good, thank you. Fine.

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:36.408
- Hey, Carlos!
- No, I'm good.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.502
How about giving my man a hand over here?

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.638
Everything's fine.

01:08:38.714 --> 01:08:41.182
- We got it, Mr. Barlow. Don't worry about it.
- See you later, Donny.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:45.243
- What?
- I'm good. See you later, Donny.

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:48.951
- Keep it real, Mr. Barlow.
- You know it.

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:01.533
- What took you so long?
- I couldn't help it. Traffic.

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:05.430
Roger, this looks awfully heavy.
Can we get some help?

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:09.341
No help. We have to do this ourselves.
All we have to do is push.

01:09:09.411 --> 01:09:11.902
On the count of three. One, two, three, push.

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.447
In you go!

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.384
- Let's get out of here!
- Okay.

01:09:28.296 --> 01:09:31.733
This is Renoir.
He likes to ride in the car sometimes.

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:33.835
- Stay behind them.
- Okay.

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:04.529
Sorry about banging you
around like that, George.

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:07.927
I didn't know
how else to get you into the van.

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:12.667
- Is that you, Blue Dragon?
- It's me. Yellow Dragon's here, too.

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:15.333
Hi, Red Dragon.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:21.045
Forget the code names, gentlemen.
We did it. We beat them.

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:25.849
We took everything they had to throw at us
and we threw it right back at them.

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:29.454
I'm really proud to have served
with you men. Semper fi.

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:30.856
Semper fi.

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:36.162
- It does feel pretty good, doesn't it, Roger?
- You know, it does. It really does.

01:10:36.865 --> 01:10:40.892
- You can get out now, George. What?
- I am out.

01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:50.876
Look! Look!

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:57.008
Guys! Guys! Get me out...
Get me out of here!

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.515
Get me out of here! Guys! Guys!

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:05.552
- Guys! Wait, wait! Where are you going?
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:07.528
Don't leave me! You're leaving me!

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:09.757
- Where are you going, guys?
- George, get back in the crate.

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:11.697
Get back in the crate!

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:16.102
How could this have happened?
I thought we had it all worked out!

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:19.231
I don't know. George, quick question.

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:23.070
When we were back at the warehouse
and you said third crate from the left...

01:11:23.145 --> 01:11:27.809
- was that your left or my left?
- My left! My left! Why would it be your left?

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:31.341
- Because it's my left.
- Oh, my God! This is a disaster!

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:35.819
This is a disaster! The mission's in jeopardy!
We don't have a battle plan!

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:38.519
Don't panic! If you panic, I'll panic.

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:41.061
This is a soldier's worst nightmare,
gentlemen!

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.119
Chaos!

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:44.631
Calm down, George,
we're gonna get you out of there.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.134
We just have to make one quick stop first.

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:48.863
- Stop?
- A stop?

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:52.703
- We have to stop at my house.
- A stop? What are you talking about?

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:56.404
You can't leave me here! I'm down
behind enemy lines! They'll make me talk!

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:59.140
- I don't think I can take torture, guys.
- I'm sorry about this.

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:00.238
- I'll only be a minute.
- I'm sorry...

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.113
...but I'm not the man you think I am.

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:04.243
- Keep him company. Make sure...
- What are we going to do?

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.652
...he doesn't panic.
- I think he's already panicked.

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:08.952
Good point. Make sure he stays in the crate.

01:12:09.024 --> 01:12:10.958
- Okay, thanks.
- You gotta get me out of here!

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:14.325
- Hi, it's me, Charles.
- Charles? Where's Roger?

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:19.024
- Well, he had to go and get his wife.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:21.160
I don't understand.
What's his wife have to do with this?

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:23.397
I thought I told him to stand up to her!

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:27.134
Rose? Where are you, Rose?

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:30.540
I'm in the bedroom, Roger.
Where do you think I am?

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:33.274
- I can't stand it when you're late.
- What? You're not packed yet?

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.214
You were supposed to be here
a half an hour ago.

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:37.184
I know, I got hung up at work.

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:40.483
But, look, we have to go right now,
I'm telling you. Get your things.

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:42.615
- Roger, wait a minute.
- Is this everything?

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:45.353
No, it's not:Wait. Roger, don't zip it.

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:47.725
- I'm not finished.
- I'm zipping!

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:51.194
Roger, what is going on? Why...
Roger, you're making me very nervous.

01:12:51.266 --> 01:12:52.255
Why are you acting like this?

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:54.802
I'm not:Acting like what?
I can't wait to get going.

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:57.236
Is there something wrong with that?

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:59.069
Well, how are we getting to the airport?

01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:01.803
- I have a friend to drive us.
- A friend?

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:04.903
- What friend, Roger? Here.
- He's somebody I work with.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.074
He's got a van he likes to drive.
Beyond that, it gets complicated...

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:11.608
...but he's waiting downstairs,
so can we go now, please?

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:15.916
- Roger, you're acting very strange.
- I'm not strange. You're strange.

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:18.619
- Come on!
- Roger, wait!

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:21.788
What?

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:25.098
Say "beach. "

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:27.062
Okay, take the picture. Take the...

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:30.071
- Please, take the picture!
- All right, all right, all right!

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:33.074
Roger, do you have some sort of surprise
planned for me?

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:36.543
Yes, that's a good way to put it. Let's go.

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:41.081
Roger, Roger! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:46.278
Are you sure you want to go to Florida
dressed like that?

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:50.516
I'm not panicked.
I'm a little panicked, but:God!

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:52.757
We're gonna get you out, George.
Don't worry.

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:56.127
What would you do? I have to think like you.

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.827
What would you do?

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:02.328
You gotta get me out of here! Oh, no!

01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:04.736
Sorry, I gotta go, George. Bye.

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:06.069
- No, Charles, don't...
- Over.

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:08.871
I'm going, Roger, I'm going! All right.

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:18.676
Roger, careful!

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:22.448
- Roger!
- Everything's fine.

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:27.493
- I want you to meet Charles. My wife, Rose.
- Hello.

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:30.125
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:34.693
Roger said that you volunteered to take us
to the airport. That's very nice of you.

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:37.432
- Well, I think the plan is...
- No, no, no.

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:42.068
Don't explain anything. I know that Roger
has a little surprise planned for us.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.738
- I don't want you to ruin it.
- Okay, I won't.

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:47.441
- Step on it, Charles.
- Yeah, yeah, yes.

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:17.267
Wait, wait, wait.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.904
Why are we stopping here, guys?
The airport's over there.

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:20.107
We have to drop the crate off...

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.740
- This is cargo.
:And pick up George.

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:23.375
- George?
- He's another friend of mine.

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:25.010
I told him we'd pick him up.

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:26.850
Who are all these friends of yours?
I never met George.

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:28.549
I'll be right back.
Charles is gonna stay with you.

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:29.682
- We have a plane to catch.
- I am?

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:31.225
I'll be right back.

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:34.023
- Is this part of the surprise?
- In a way.

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:38.128
I've never even heard of George.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.193
Thirty-two years, and all of a sudden
he's got all these friends.

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:44.362
- Do you know George?
- Yes.

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:48.000
I mean, yes.
Yes, he's a friend, like Roger said.

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:54.114
A nice guy.
A little tense, but then who isn't, right?

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:57.750
- How's it going? You two getting along?
- Roger!

01:15:57.819 --> 01:16:00.811
I hope you realize
we are going to miss our plane!

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:03.551
We're fine, Rose. Plenty of time.

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:07.924
We're going to miss our plane.

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:36.049
- George, is that you?
- Yes!

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:39.191
Yes, yes, it's me! Get me out of here, Roger!

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:42.162
My legs are falling asleep!
I can't feel my toes!

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:45.563
- Okay. Okay, George.
- Get me out of here as fast as you can!

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:48.159
Can I help you with something, mister?

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:50.568
Yes, as a matter of fact, you can.

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:55.474
You see, I need to get this crate
into that van ASAP.

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:59.472
- And you are?
- I work for the museum.

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:03.908
I'm a security guard. Some items got sent off
when they shouldn't have...

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:07.649
- And they sent me to work it out.
- Do you have paperwork?

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:12.253
Nobody said anything about paperwork.

01:17:12.327 --> 01:17:15.956
Well, then, you don't get no crate.
That's how that works.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.228
You see, maybe we can talk about this.

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:24.538
Because I've been sent to pick up this crate.

01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:29.107
I had a cat when I was a little girl.
A white cat.

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:32.978
Her name was Snuggles.

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:38.680
Well, this is Renoir.

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:42.416
Like the painter.

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:49.891
- Roger loves paintings.
- I know.

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:54.497
This is ridiculous.

01:18:05.547 --> 01:18:06.775
Roger!

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:10.749
Roger! Roger! What are you doing up here?

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:15.049
What are you doing?
I told you to wait in the van!

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:20.352
It is 10:20! We need to go right now!

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:21.486
- Excuse me, miss...
- We're going, we're going.

01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:23.155
We need to go. Where's your friend George?

01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:24.926
You said you were coming up here
to get your friend George.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.024
Are you George?

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:28.228
- Who is George?
- Sir, please.

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:31.062
Rose, I've got things under control.

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:33.833
- Give me one more minute, I promise you.
- Roger...

01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:37.436
I love surprises, I do. I'm very touched.
But we need to...

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:39.377
I can't leave here without this crate!

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:41.575
Listen, buddy, I already told you,
you're not getting the crate...

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:42.674
One second, please.

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:45.686
Rose, I know how much this trip
means to you...

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:49.813
...and I know I've been acting crazy lately,
but it's all going to end soon.

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:54.726
We're gonna make that plane. I just
need you to please, please, wait in the van.

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:57.424
Roger.

01:18:57.799 --> 01:19:01.428
We're going to Florida.
We're gonna make that plane.

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:12.072
Here's the deal. That's my wife, Rose.

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:15.412
In less than 20 minutes, I promised her
we'd be on a plane to Florida.

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:17.975
It's our anniversary.
It'll break her heart if we don't go...

01:19:18.053 --> 01:19:21.853
...but I cannot leave here
until I get this crate into that van.

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:24.450
Are you a married man, Leo?

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:29.163
Then you know what I'm talking about.
Give me a break.

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:33.497
I really do work for the museum.
That's my wife. That's my crazy wife.

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:35.000
What a guy!

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:41.002
Why are we turning off here? We need to go
to Departures! Is this a shortcut, Roger?

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:43.101
- Yeah. We'll try. We'll try.
- We are never going to make it.

01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:44.440
We are gonna have to go all the way.

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:46.947
- Pull over here. Right over here.
- No, no, don't stop!

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:49.074
- Pull over.
- Roger, why are we stopping?

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:50.982
- Hang on, George!
- What are we doing?

01:19:51.052 --> 01:19:52.781
You're almost free.

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:55.681
Hang on, George!

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:59.822
- What are you doing?
- I'm free at last! I'm free!

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:04.759
Why are you naked?

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:11.801
- Hi.
- Roger, is this the surprise?

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:16.936
- Turn away! That's my wife.
- This is our friend George.

01:20:17.379 --> 01:20:19.074
- You must be Rose.
- Put your pants on!

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:21.240
- Are we going to Florida?
- Guys!

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:24.285
We did it! We did it!
I cannot believe we did it!

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:26.752
Yes! We did it!

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:28.453
We did it!

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:31.885
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to sunny Miami, Florida...

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:34.861
where the local temperature is 86 degrees.

01:20:35.063 --> 01:20:36.932
Please be careful when opening
your overhead compartments...

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:56.343
Roger?

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:00.581
Roger?

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:05.652
Roger?

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:09.087
Roger?

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:15.262
Roger.

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:11.390
Just a minute. Stay there.

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:20.562
Stay right:What?

01:22:21.536 --> 01:22:23.333
Are you feeling okay?

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:28.532
Are you all right, Roger?

01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:55.299
Roger.

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:08.979
George? Roger's here.

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:11.141
Roger! Welcome home, man.

01:23:11.953 --> 01:23:14.148
I think you'll find
we've made some improvements.

01:23:14.222 --> 01:23:18.056
George and I thought
they deserved a more appropriate setting.

01:23:20.195 --> 01:23:22.060
She's all yours, Roger.

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.724
Charles, I'm gonna put these on
down in your apartment.

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:25.891
Sure.

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.198
What the hell?

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:37.974
- Okay. All right. Bye.
- Okay.

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:41.877
- Hey, George?
- Yeah?

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:44.450
We did good.

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:46.980
Roger.

01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:55.586
- We did good.
- We sure did.

01:23:56.664 --> 01:23:58.291
See you tomorrow.
