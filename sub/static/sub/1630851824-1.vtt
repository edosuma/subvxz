00:58.433 --> 01:03.729
DEEP RED

03:13.985 --> 03:15.944
Great!

03:18.781 --> 03:22.409
Really, that's good. Very good.

03:23.494 --> 03:26.079
Maybe a bit too good.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.332
Too clean. Yes, too precise.

03:28.416 --> 03:33.045
Too... formal.
It should be more trashy.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.672
See what I mean?

03:35.757 --> 03:38.800
Remember that this sort of jazz

03:38.885 --> 03:41.803
came out of the brothels...

03:42.597 --> 03:44.932
PARAPSYCHOLOGY
CONGRESS

04:08.248 --> 04:12.876
This is a proven fact
that can easily be demonstrated.

04:12.961 --> 04:17.256
For instance, if we put a butterfly
in a cage, within a few hours,

04:17.340 --> 04:23.553
it will be able to gather
many other butterflies around it

04:23.638 --> 04:27.599
which will quickly swarm in,
in answer to its call,

04:27.684 --> 04:33.188
even covering a distance
of several miles. This is telepathy.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.116
No, no!

06:49.200 --> 06:53.370
Out! Out!

12:48.934 --> 12:51.644
I really need some rest.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.813
I'm feeling very tired.

12:59.904 --> 13:04.157
Shouldn't we talk about that
right away?

13:07.870 --> 13:15.168
I'd like this article to be published
while I'm still in Italy.

13:18.380 --> 13:22.342
Yes, I am alone.

13:44.740 --> 13:51.120
Yes, I am a bit jumpy,
but don't worry.

13:55.292 --> 13:58.002
We'll talk again tomorrow?

16:16.100 --> 16:19.936
Anyway, it means

16:20.020 --> 16:25.984
alla salute, cheers,
à votre santé, skål!

16:27.987 --> 16:33.408
Listen, Carlo, when I was in America
I met a lot of people like you.

20:43.992 --> 20:47.912
The victim seems to be about
35 to 40 years old.

20:47.996 --> 20:52.083
She has abrasions and cuts
all over her body.

20:54.711 --> 20:57.755
So, you're a foreigner, then?

20:57.839 --> 21:00.049
Yes, I was born in London

21:00.133 --> 21:03.552
but I lived in America
for several years before coming here.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.848
And what are you doing in Italy?

21:07.933 --> 21:12.645
I'm a pianist. Jazz.
I teach here at the conservatory.

21:12.729 --> 21:16.065
- I teach jazz.
- And you play the piano, right?

21:18.318 --> 21:22.571
So, in that case
you don't have a job, right?

21:22.656 --> 21:27.326
- I told you, I'm a pianist.
- Yeah, sure.

21:27.411 --> 21:31.205
So, then, that's your only job.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.959
Playing an instrument isn't a job?
What is it, a joke?

21:35.043 --> 21:39.630
What are you saying?
No, I would never say that.

21:39.715 --> 21:44.969
In fact, in my family
I have a cousin who plays the...

21:46.680 --> 21:48.973
What?

21:49.057 --> 21:50.725
The violin.

23:07.677 --> 23:11.180
Get lost!
You can't come in here.

23:11.264 --> 23:15.184
Why not? With a crime like this,
the first thing you do is call the press.

23:15.268 --> 23:18.562
Get your hands off me!
I told you, you can't come in here!

23:18.647 --> 23:20.689
This is a complex investigation.

23:20.774 --> 23:24.693
Look who's here.
Gianna Brezzi.

24:11.741 --> 24:16.203
Why must I go to the police station?
I told you everything I know!

24:16.288 --> 24:19.540
Your statement
has to be typed up officially.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.042
You know how it is with bureaucracy.

24:22.127 --> 24:27.590
All your details are needed:
place and date of birth, passport, etc.

24:36.391 --> 24:39.393
My head is splitting!

24:42.647 --> 24:47.276
And you, what the hell
are you doing here at this hour?

24:47.360 --> 24:50.738
I'm on my way home
after four hours at the police station.

24:50.822 --> 24:54.200
Oh yeah, right.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.994
I forgot about the murder.

24:58.663 --> 25:01.373
How did it go?

25:01.458 --> 25:05.169
What kind of question is that?
How do you suppose it went?

25:05.253 --> 25:07.588
Come on, I'll walk you home.

25:07.672 --> 25:11.800
No, thank you.
I can make it by myself.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.971
I can make it, I said!

25:22.771 --> 25:28.150
Oh, my poor head, my head.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.153
Tell me, how much did you drink?

25:32.322 --> 25:36.158
Who knows? Who can remember
anything about this night?

25:36.243 --> 25:38.744
But I'm sure it must have been a lot.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.354
No, I don't think so.

26:47.439 --> 26:51.275
If I remember well, it was some sort
of composition of faces.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.694
It was very unusual.

26:55.280 --> 26:59.950
Maybe you've seen something
so important that you don't realise.

27:01.578 --> 27:04.997
I'm just trying to understand,
because...

27:05.081 --> 27:10.919
You know, sometimes, what you
actually see and what you imagine...

27:12.714 --> 27:16.884
...get mixed up in your memory
like a cocktail...

27:18.970 --> 27:22.765
...where you can no longer distinguish
one flavour from another.

27:22.849 --> 27:24.850
But I'm telling you the truth!

27:24.934 --> 27:28.687
No, Marc.
You think you're telling the truth,

27:28.772 --> 27:33.901
but in fact you're only telling
your version of the truth.

27:35.403 --> 27:38.197
It happens to me all the time.

29:09.247 --> 29:14.418
You may not believe me, but I don't
have a steady boyfriend right now.

29:14.502 --> 29:17.337
- Me neither.
- I should hope not!

29:17.422 --> 29:21.759
- I meant a girlfriend!
- That's why you're always so jumpy.

29:21.843 --> 29:25.137
Me jumpy? Oh, please!
I'm not jumpy at all.

29:25.221 --> 29:27.347
Yeah, right. Stop fidgeting!

29:27.432 --> 29:30.642
And your hands are shaking.
Tell me, what's going on?

29:30.727 --> 29:33.687
How many times must I tell you,
I'm an artist?

29:33.772 --> 29:38.734
In case you've forgotten,
we artists are very sensitive people.

29:38.818 --> 29:41.737
We don't have elephant hide
like you journalists.

29:41.821 --> 29:46.950
Elephant hide?
I'm told I have very delicate skin.

29:47.035 --> 29:50.496
You can touch it. Come on, try.

29:50.580 --> 29:54.124
- Yes, not bad.
- It's fantastic.

29:55.752 --> 29:58.295
I know how to stop your jumpiness.

29:58.379 --> 30:01.924
What? Here at the cemetery?
Are you crazy?

30:02.008 --> 30:05.135
I have other things on my mind.
Do you understand?

30:05.220 --> 30:07.930
- Sure, you're scared senseless.
- I'm not scared!

30:08.014 --> 30:10.766
Right.
You're almost shitting yourself.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.726
And it's all my fault.

30:12.811 --> 30:17.815
I'd like to see him.
I'm curious to see him face to face.

30:17.899 --> 30:20.651
You'd be better off
returning to England.

30:20.735 --> 30:22.611
I actually decided to stay.

30:22.695 --> 30:25.280
- You just decided?
- Yes, maybe.

30:25.365 --> 30:29.326
Anyway, I need to concentrate.
I must try to remember.

30:29.410 --> 30:32.204
I'm sure I saw something
important that night

30:32.288 --> 30:35.415
but I can't remember what exactly!

30:37.335 --> 30:40.379
Are you driving?

30:56.062 --> 30:59.022
Long live Italy!

32:15.600 --> 32:20.020
Tell me, Enrico, why do Australian
boomerang sellers go bankrupt?

32:20.104 --> 32:21.980
I don't know that one.

32:22.065 --> 32:26.068
Because the goods
are always returned!

32:26.861 --> 32:29.613
Funny, don't you think?

32:29.697 --> 32:34.242
- Is Carlo not in yet?
- He never shows up before 10:00.

32:34.327 --> 32:39.081
Can you tell him I was looking for him?
I need to speak to him urgently.

38:42.903 --> 38:45.488
I'll try to call you.

38:46.741 --> 38:50.160
OK. But I'll tell you again
that I don't...

38:50.244 --> 38:52.829
If you don't want to, just say so.

38:52.913 --> 38:57.625
I was just trying to say
that I don't know what time I'll be back.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.506
All right.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.052
Bye.

39:09.889 --> 39:12.515
Tell me the truth.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.811
Do you find me so unattractive?

39:16.896 --> 39:18.813
No.

39:18.898 --> 39:23.401
So, what's wrong, then?
My scent? What?

39:23.486 --> 39:25.862
Nothing at all, why?

39:25.946 --> 39:29.074
Oh, nothing. I was just wondering.

42:30.756 --> 42:33.299
See. He's been like this
for over an hour.

42:33.384 --> 42:36.135
He started drinking, as usual.

42:36.220 --> 42:40.223
Maybe more than usual.
Then he started talking nonsense.

43:03.747 --> 43:08.209
But I already told you, you won't
last long if you drink so much.

43:08.294 --> 43:12.255
And I told you, who wants to last?

43:13.674 --> 43:17.802
The liver is gone,
and so are the intestines.

43:17.886 --> 43:22.098
Come on, try to get up. Put your head
under a cold tap. It will do you good.

43:22.182 --> 43:25.018
Then I'll take you out
for some fresh air.

47:56.331 --> 47:58.207
Carlo should be careful.

47:58.292 --> 48:02.169
If they find out he's a good pianist,
they'll get rid of him for sure!

54:37.732 --> 54:40.651
A particular time and day
of the week, even clothing.

54:40.735 --> 54:44.071
Something that recreates
the same images

54:44.155 --> 54:50.035
that frame a context
that provoked trauma in the past.

55:42.130 --> 55:44.798
THE MODERN GHOST
AND THE BLACK LEGENDS OF TODAY

55:56.186 --> 55:57.686
"THE HOUSE
OF THE SCREAMING CHILD

55:57.771 --> 56:00.356
"In a house near Rome,
a strange thing happened.

56:00.440 --> 56:02.524
"One night,
a hunter woke before dawn

56:02.609 --> 56:05.277
"and heard a child singing
in a high shrill voice.

56:05.362 --> 56:08.906
"Soon after, the voice stopped
and he heard screaming and weeping."

1:07:34.258 --> 1:07:37.635
You have two choices. You can
either flee to Lebanon, quickly...

1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:42.474
Or I can try to find out
what's going on as soon as possible.

1:07:42.558 --> 1:07:45.560
How long will the police take
to find me?

1:07:45.644 --> 1:07:48.313
Did you take a taxi to Amanda's?

1:07:48.397 --> 1:07:51.566
No, a rental car.
Why haven't you fixed this seat?

1:07:51.650 --> 1:07:54.944
- I feel silly sitting so low down!
- I forgot. Sorry.

1:07:55.029 --> 1:07:57.614
They'll find you by your fingerprints.

1:07:57.698 --> 1:08:00.950
I bet you left
them all over the house, right?

1:08:01.035 --> 1:08:03.620
It would take another Florence flood

1:08:03.704 --> 1:08:05.914
to wipe them clean!

1:08:07.208 --> 1:08:09.709
Say they find
the body tomorrow morning.

1:08:09.794 --> 1:08:12.587
They'll check the prints
against the usual suspects.

1:08:12.671 --> 1:08:15.590
It'll take them
a while to connect both murders,

1:08:15.674 --> 1:08:18.718
but in the end they'll be after you.

1:08:18.803 --> 1:08:22.097
You only have
a couple of days. It's not long.

1:08:23.599 --> 1:08:27.977
No, it's not.
But first, I have to find this.

1:08:31.482 --> 1:08:36.361
What a nice house. It looks strange.
Do you know where it is?

1:08:36.445 --> 1:08:39.322
I wouldn't have to look for it if I knew!

1:08:40.282 --> 1:08:44.119
- So, what are you going to do?
- I'm not telling you.

1:08:44.203 --> 1:08:47.789
It seems like
everything here has ears.

1:08:47.873 --> 1:08:50.917
How could the killer know
I was coming here?

1:08:51.001 --> 1:08:53.294
I have no idea.

1:08:54.922 --> 1:08:59.008
One thing's for sure.
I'm not telling anyone my next move.

1:08:59.093 --> 1:09:02.679
This is so unbelievable!
You're so nice!

1:09:02.763 --> 1:09:06.307
Hey, darling,
I hope you don't think that I'm...

1:09:06.392 --> 1:09:10.478
Listen, I'm doing this to protect you,
to keep you out of danger.

1:09:10.563 --> 1:09:13.690
- I promise, as soon as I...
- Blah, blah, blah!

1:09:13.774 --> 1:09:17.902
I swear, as soon as I discover
something, I'll tell you.

1:09:17.987 --> 1:09:22.031
Why don't we stop
this stupid childish competition?

1:09:22.116 --> 1:09:24.200
We should be working together.

1:09:24.285 --> 1:09:27.328
You know,
two brains are better than one.

1:09:28.622 --> 1:09:31.207
Just where do you women
keep your brains?

1:09:31.292 --> 1:09:33.668
Let's be honest.
Women have brute force,

1:09:33.752 --> 1:09:38.089
you beat us at arm wrestling, but men
have the monopoly on intelligence.

1:09:38.174 --> 1:09:40.842
- Have I made myself clear?
- Yes, very clear.

1:09:40.926 --> 1:09:43.011
At last.

1:09:44.221 --> 1:09:46.556
A little drink?

1:09:47.808 --> 1:09:51.519
I have Anisette,

1:09:51.604 --> 1:09:54.731
Sambuca, Caffé Borghetti.

1:09:54.815 --> 1:09:57.734
Don't you have anything less sickly?

1:09:59.987 --> 1:10:01.863
Whisky? Cognac?

1:10:01.947 --> 1:10:04.866
Yes, that's better.

1:10:08.829 --> 1:10:12.040
We'd be more comfortable
at my place, don't you think?

1:10:13.417 --> 1:10:16.044
Maybe, but we're fine here.

1:10:16.128 --> 1:10:19.464
Yes, but I think it would be better
at my place.

1:10:21.592 --> 1:10:23.635
OK, let's go.

1:10:36.398 --> 1:10:39.859
Who do you think you are, idiot?

1:10:39.944 --> 1:10:43.154
I've never met a man
as arrogant as you!

1:10:43.239 --> 1:10:45.823
You must have been spoilt rotten
by women!

1:10:45.908 --> 1:10:50.495
Anyway, it's because I don't have
a boyfriend right now. That's all!

1:10:50.579 --> 1:10:52.789
You've got such a big head.

1:10:52.873 --> 1:10:55.959
- Oh, damn.
- What's wrong?

1:10:56.710 --> 1:10:58.127
Guess.

1:12:00.274 --> 1:12:04.527
Where's my bottle? Spit out my bottle,
for Christ's sake! Damn you.

1:12:04.611 --> 1:12:07.989
Captain, finally!
I've been looking for you for an hour!

1:12:08.073 --> 1:12:11.075
What do you want?
Does no one check these machines?

1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:13.494
They do, but they steal the drinks.

1:12:13.579 --> 1:12:16.289
Of course!
This place is full of thieves!

1:12:16.373 --> 1:12:21.169
- Sorry, sir, but you're not thinking.
- Not you, idiot.

1:12:21.253 --> 1:12:24.797
So, are you doing overtime?

1:12:24.882 --> 1:12:27.717
Yes. The strike's been called off
for now.

1:12:28.802 --> 1:12:31.220
Our requests
are examined by the Ministry.

1:12:31.305 --> 1:12:35.516
- But we're planning a sit-in.
- What are you planning?

1:12:35.601 --> 1:12:39.395
A protest sit-in.
We all gather outside in the courtyard

1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:41.773
and stay there
for one, two, four hours...

1:12:41.857 --> 1:12:45.693
- What did you want to tell me before?
- I almost forgot.

1:12:45.778 --> 1:12:48.738
The chief is here
and he insists on speaking to you.

1:12:48.822 --> 1:12:50.656
Oh, crap!

1:12:52.159 --> 1:12:56.120
Hello? Is that Professor Giordani?

1:12:57.164 --> 1:13:01.584
This is Marc Daly. I need
to talk to you. It's very important.

1:13:02.711 --> 1:13:06.798
No, I'd like to see you right now,
if possible.

1:13:06.882 --> 1:13:09.384
Amanda Righetti was murdered.

1:15:02.998 --> 1:15:06.667
FOR SALE
TO LET

1:18:26.952 --> 1:18:29.620
IT WAS...

1:36:24.945 --> 1:36:28.364
- Hello, Gianna?
- Hi Marc. Having fun?

1:36:28.491 --> 1:36:31.659
I'm having a ball.
I finished two crossword puzzles.

1:36:31.786 --> 1:36:34.412
Well, I have a tough puzzle
to solve here.

1:36:34.538 --> 1:36:36.790
They killed Giordani not long ago.

1:36:36.916 --> 1:36:40.251
The neighbours called the police.
They heard screaming.

1:36:43.798 --> 1:36:48.051
- What happened there?
- Nothing, it's just a scratch.

1:36:48.135 --> 1:36:50.011
Listen.

1:36:51.055 --> 1:36:56.059
Seriously, I have to admit
I don't know what's going on right now.

1:36:57.686 --> 1:37:02.774
This son of a bitch knows everything!
He knows every move in advance.

1:37:02.858 --> 1:37:06.110
Sorry, but I don't remember
where you said I should flee to?

1:37:06.195 --> 1:37:09.030
- Lebanon.
- Yeah, right.

1:37:09.156 --> 1:37:11.199
Lebanon.

1:37:11.283 --> 1:37:14.994
But I'd have to fly to get there
and I'm scared of flying.

1:37:15.079 --> 1:37:17.330
It's nothing to be nervous about.

1:37:17.414 --> 1:37:21.209
Just think you'll be landing soon,
one way or another.

1:37:21.293 --> 1:37:23.920
Thank you.

1:37:24.004 --> 1:37:27.090
How about we take the car
and drive to Spain?

1:37:27.174 --> 1:37:31.052
We? You mean that I can come too?

1:37:31.178 --> 1:37:35.932
- Yes, if you'd like to.
- Of course I'd like to!

1:37:36.016 --> 1:37:39.143
We'll have a fantastic holiday!

1:37:39.270 --> 1:37:43.273
Sun, sea, bullfights, parties,
flamenco... How does it sound?

1:37:43.399 --> 1:37:46.359
Sure, of course.
I suggested it, after all.

1:37:46.443 --> 1:37:49.654
I don't know about you
but I'm on the verge of a breakdown.

1:37:49.738 --> 1:37:52.782
There's no point staying here
and talking about it.

1:37:52.867 --> 1:37:58.079
Come on. Let's not waste any time.
You go back home and pack.

1:37:59.039 --> 1:38:01.040
I'll be back in an hour!

1:38:01.125 --> 1:38:07.255
We'll have to rent a car,
because mine isn't good for long trips.

1:38:07.339 --> 1:38:09.215
I know.

1:38:09.300 --> 1:38:12.218
I love you!

1:38:14.889 --> 1:38:17.390
And who's this?

1:38:18.809 --> 1:38:23.605
An old girlfriend.
Her name is Carol.

1:38:23.689 --> 1:38:27.692
- From Rome?
- She's American. She lives in Paris.

1:38:27.776 --> 1:38:33.156
You used to go for vamps, then?
You like super sexy women.

1:40:09.253 --> 1:40:12.130
Gianna - I'm at 27 Via Susa.
