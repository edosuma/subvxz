WEBVTT

00:03.602 --> 00:05.570
And what exactly
are they walking into?

00:05.605 --> 00:08.808
There's at least a dozen
underground factions that would

00:08.843 --> 00:11.828
die to get their hands
on the laser defense shield.

00:11.863 --> 00:14.814
I needed to make sure
security is tight as a drum.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.983
So you don't trust
the government troops either.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.221
We've both been
around long enough to know
you don't trust anybody.

00:21.256 --> 00:24.642
Even each other?

00:24.677 --> 00:28.028
Maybe especially.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:41.241 --> 00:42.842
Delta point 2. report.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.661
Delta point 2 clear.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.446
Code 705... ugh!

00:49.649 --> 00:52.017
Tango point 1. report.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.454
Tango point 1 weapon secure.

00:56.456 --> 00:58.023
Adam. - Here.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.859
Well, your tip was right.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.626
She's a little too late.

01:01.661 --> 01:04.063
There's
a dozen of 'em, maybe more,
crawling all over the place.

01:05.265 --> 01:07.667
The weapon
they're after has massive
destructive capabilities.

01:07.702 --> 01:09.269
We can't let them
get their hands on it.

01:09.304 --> 01:10.870
Well, you heard the man.

01:11.271 --> 01:14.074
C'mon.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.484
We're under attack. Call it in!

01:36.896 --> 01:38.898
Well, do the honors.

01:48.908 --> 01:52.112
<coughing>

02:35.355 --> 02:36.956
what the hell happened?

02:36.991 --> 02:38.558
Some kind of gas.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.960
Come on.

03:46.359 --> 03:49.162
Somehow, you carried molecules
of nerve gas with you when

03:49.197 --> 03:51.965
you re-phased back
out of the building.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.584
What are you saying?

03:53.619 --> 03:55.133
I've been exposed?

03:55.168 --> 03:56.369
No, it's more
dangerous than that.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.936
No, no...

03:57.971 --> 03:59.572
the nerve gas molecules bonded
with your molecular structure.

03:59.607 --> 04:02.340
Which means...?

04:02.375 --> 04:04.377
You know, i
mean, your body should work
them out over time, right?

04:04.412 --> 04:06.379
But until that happens,
we have to stay on guard against

04:06.414 --> 04:08.381
symptoms of contamination.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.948
Contamination.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.350
Now, just when i was
starting to feel better, huh?

04:12.385 --> 04:15.188
Does that
mean we wasted our money
on the flowers oh, hey, no.

04:15.223 --> 04:17.555
Any time a girl
gets me flowers...

04:17.589 --> 04:20.392
yeah, well,
just be thankful you're
getting them above ground.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.959
That's right.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.561
Because if you'd re-phased
solid and even gotten a whiff of

04:23.596 --> 04:26.799
that nerve gas,
it would've paralyzed your
central nervous system.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.001
Hmm.

04:28.401 --> 04:30.003
That'll teach me to practise
holding my breath, huh?

04:30.038 --> 04:33.606
Smells great.

04:34.807 --> 04:36.409
<gasping>

04:38.011 --> 04:38.776
jesse!

04:38.811 --> 04:40.013
Jesse, un-phase!

04:40.048 --> 04:41.179
I can't.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.780
Jesse, concentrate.

04:42.815 --> 04:44.417
The longer you stay unstable
the more dangerous it is.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.236
Jesse, focus.

04:46.271 --> 04:47.986
Come on, jess.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.587
You have a couple of seconds.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.224
After that, you're not
going to be able to re-form.

04:51.259 --> 04:53.226
Ah!

04:53.626 --> 04:55.428
Take it easy.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.195
<panting> agh!

04:57.230 --> 05:00.833
Adam, what the hell happened?

05:00.868 --> 05:04.437
I wish i knew.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.656
How you doing today?

05:23.691 --> 05:25.658
I need to see some id.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.454
So what's going on with jess?

05:56.489 --> 05:58.891
The nerve gas has affected the
section of his nervous system

05:58.926 --> 06:00.493
that controls
his power to phase out.

06:00.893 --> 06:02.060
Oh...

06:02.095 --> 06:03.261
what's that mean?

06:03.296 --> 06:05.263
He's losing his powers?

06:05.298 --> 06:06.899
No. It's more about control.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.501
But if he goes intangible
again before this stuff works

06:08.901 --> 06:10.503
itself out of his system...

06:10.903 --> 06:14.107
well, he could literally
dissipate into thin air.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.324
Deploy!

06:50.143 --> 06:54.947
Perimeter set at one
hundred and fifty metres, sir.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.352
Vengeance is
mine, sayeth the lord.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.561
Now.

07:14.567 --> 07:20.973
Round up all the personnel and
secure them in the utility area.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.181
Why didn't you tell me
you were sending my people into

07:28.216 --> 07:29.782
a fully-equipped military unit?

07:29.817 --> 07:31.349
Adam, i didn't know.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.950
Well, that's not good enough.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.187
You put the lives
on my people on the line.

07:34.222 --> 07:36.206
How's jesse?

07:36.241 --> 07:38.156
Not good.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.792
There's no way of telling
how much of that nerve gas

07:39.827 --> 07:41.359
penetrated his system.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.396
Adam, believe me when i say
we had no idea the man behind

07:43.796 --> 07:44.997
this was so dangerous.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.564
Who is this guy?

07:46.599 --> 07:48.200
Colonel aaron gaumont.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.802
Never heard of him.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.769
You shouldn't have.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.806
At one point, he headed
up the most covert military

07:53.841 --> 07:55.373
intelligence division
we had to offer.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.810
As far as the government
was concerned, he doesn't exist.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.777
Well, i wish
that was still true.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.215
He disappeared on a mission in
the middle east five years ago.

08:02.250 --> 08:04.617
Until this morning,
we thought he was dead.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.219
At this point,
we have no motive...

08:06.254 --> 08:08.038
beverly.

08:08.073 --> 08:09.822
Beverly.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.424
Am i losing you?

08:11.459 --> 08:12.990
Hold on.

08:13.025 --> 08:15.027
We're getting a feed
directly from gaumont.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.830
I'm patching it into you.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.998
Twelve of my loyal soldiers

08:21.033 --> 08:23.035
- the finest this
country has to offer

08:23.436 --> 08:28.241
- died during a
government-sponsored covert
operation in kyrgyzstan.

08:28.276 --> 08:31.409
They were men
who lived valiantly,

08:31.444 --> 08:35.413
and did everything their
government called on them to do.

08:35.448 --> 08:42.655
And they found themselves
abandoned and betrayed
by those they served.

08:43.054 --> 08:47.059
Now you who know nothing
of honour must now pay.

08:47.094 --> 08:51.028
Ten million dollars
for each fallen soldier.

08:51.063 --> 08:56.068
I've taken control of the
nuclear facility at twin creeks.

08:56.103 --> 09:01.073
If you do not come up with
the money in twenty-four hours,

09:01.474 --> 09:04.677
you will experience a holocaust
the likes of which this

09:04.712 --> 09:07.480
country has never seen.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.648
Twin creeks was shut down
years ago and was turned into a

09:10.683 --> 09:14.687
top secret facility to develop
a reactor fuel called xiraxium.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.689
And a guy with his clearance
must have known that.

09:17.089 --> 09:19.892
Xiraxium is a radioactive
compound a million times more

09:19.927 --> 09:21.859
lethal than plutonium.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.662
So if gaumont can initiate
a meltdown, we're talking about

09:24.697 --> 09:27.900
something that
makes chernobyl look like
a sunday afternoon cookout.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.467
Then this is huge.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.103
How come the press
isn't all over this?

09:31.138 --> 09:32.670
Are you kidding?

09:32.705 --> 09:33.906
If this got out, there'd
be a widespread panic.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.473
That's right.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.475
The authorities have
managed a news blackout.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.111
They figured that we've got
about twenty hours before the

09:39.512 --> 09:40.678
army's called in.

09:40.713 --> 09:41.914
After that, all bets are off.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.481
And these "authorities"

09:43.516 --> 09:45.117
- they want us to go
in and defuse the situation.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.719
I've offered her our services.

09:46.754 --> 09:47.920
To who?

09:48.321 --> 09:49.887
The same people
that poisoned jesse?

09:49.922 --> 09:51.924
Look, i have no illusions that
these people can be trusted.

09:52.325 --> 09:53.926
I just know that the
lives of tens of millions
of people are at stake.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.928
And, brennan, look,
man, if ever you want out,

09:55.963 --> 09:57.495
i'm not going
to try to stop you.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.532
I just want you to
know, while you're here,

09:59.567 --> 10:01.534
i'm not going to ask
you to make any sacrifices

10:01.569 --> 10:03.135
that i'm not prepared
to make myself.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.554
Nobody wants that, adam.

10:04.589 --> 10:05.903
No, no. I just want answers.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.540
Okay, now, you tell me we can't
trust your source, that's fine.

10:07.575 --> 10:09.542
But i'm trusting you,
so if anything goes wrong here,

10:09.577 --> 10:12.745
it's on your head.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.165
The explosive is rigged.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.734
Camera six, sir.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.972
That's a beautiful thing.

10:40.007 --> 10:43.140
Beautiful thing.

10:43.175 --> 10:45.778
So assuming he doesn't have
control of the reactor's core,

10:45.813 --> 10:48.381
the best way to destroy
the nuclear facility would be to

10:48.416 --> 10:49.947
take out the cooling system.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.584
Yeah, well, with this
guy's security background,

10:51.619 --> 10:53.185
we can't assume anything.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.988
And to
complicate matters further,
the entire facility will be

10:56.389 --> 10:58.791
protected by the
laser weapon that he stole
from the military base.

10:58.826 --> 10:59.992
Whatever.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.559
Look, let's just get in there,

11:01.594 --> 11:03.195
take him out before
he knows what hit him.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.397
Well, that's a good idea.

11:04.432 --> 11:05.415
Only one problem.

11:05.450 --> 11:06.399
You're not going.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.801
You saw what happened
to you in the lab.

11:09.201 --> 11:10.403
What if that happens
again in the middle of a fight?

11:10.438 --> 11:11.604
I'll be okay.

11:13.606 --> 11:16.008
And besides, there'll
be plenty of bad guys
for you to get next time.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.575
Exactly.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.012
Adam, i feel fine.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.579
Right.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.215
And you're going to stay
feeling fine by helping me run

11:23.250 --> 11:25.983
the operation from here.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.421
By cracking the facility's
computer system and
taking the reactor offline.

11:28.456 --> 11:30.423
We both know i've got
a much better shot initiating a

11:30.823 --> 11:32.790
controlled shutdown
from the plant's control room.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.827
Until your system is normalised,
the chances are good that

11:34.862 --> 11:36.829
you'll die if you
try to use your powers.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.431
Then i just won't use them.

11:38.466 --> 11:39.997
Right.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.034
Because i'm not going
to put you in the position
of having to use them.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.601
You're going to
do your work from here.

11:43.636 --> 11:48.841
We got a lot more to lose
than gain by sending you in.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.648
He'll get over it.

11:55.683 --> 11:57.214
Yeah.

11:57.249 --> 11:58.851
Well, it's like adam said, it's
better frustrated than dead.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.853
Yeah, if i was jesse,
i'd be dying for some payback.

12:01.253 --> 12:02.855
I'm counting on you
guys to settle the score, huh?

12:03.255 --> 12:04.457
We got you covered.

12:04.492 --> 12:05.623
Yeah.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.025
Brennan, hook
this up to the t1 line.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.062
That'll give me access
to their computers, okay?

12:10.097 --> 12:11.681
All right.

12:11.716 --> 12:13.230
Jesse!

12:13.265 --> 12:14.666
It slipped.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.033
It's all right.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.269
Take it easy, huh, jess?

12:17.304 --> 12:18.436
Yeah.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.672
And do me a favour.

12:20.072 --> 12:20.838
Finish this.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.440
Absolutely, brother.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.877
Let's get this
goose in the air, huh?

12:24.912 --> 12:26.043
Yeah.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.481
All right.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.885
Ready?

13:19.732 --> 13:22.134
My country left
me for dead, major.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.537
Along with all my men.

13:24.937 --> 13:29.306
I was spared for one reason.

13:29.341 --> 13:33.711
To exact retribution
in their names.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.549
Money's going to go a long
way to make things right, sir.

13:36.949 --> 13:40.552
Money's all society respects.

13:40.587 --> 13:44.121
And that's how we'll hurt them.

13:44.156 --> 13:50.563
The memories of your men will
be honoured by what we do here.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.172
All right, jesse,
hook-up's complete.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.776
It's up to you now.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.981
Shall we?

14:09.016 --> 14:11.383
Let's go.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.591
Okay, i'm tied into the
facility's computer system.

14:18.626 --> 14:20.593
Initiating video
link recording...

14:20.993 --> 14:22.960
now.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.362
Video loop's in place.

14:25.397 --> 14:30.202
Any time you're ready, folks.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.808
Well, that's step one.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.810
Why is that always
the easiest step?

14:38.845 --> 14:41.413
To fool you
into taking step two.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.818
Wait, shal.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.224
That'd leave a hell of a mark.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.791
Adam was right.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.392
Laser interceptor's online.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.429
Well, unless either
of you two can phase out,

14:57.464 --> 14:59.849
we're not going anywhere.

14:59.884 --> 15:02.234
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.435
Watch this.

15:03.836 --> 15:07.439
Step back.

15:11.443 --> 15:12.645
There's a gap.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.811
Okay.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.447
I don't know how
long i can hold this.

15:15.482 --> 15:19.451
Go! Go!

15:52.685 --> 15:55.287
I get no response?

15:55.322 --> 15:57.855
Nothing yet, sir.

15:57.890 --> 16:01.058
Is it a problem, major?

16:01.093 --> 16:03.095
They cracked into
the security system.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.097
Set up a video loop.

16:05.497 --> 16:08.300
Mutant x has entered
the compound, sir.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.902
Hmm.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.705
Exactly as we planned.

16:17.943 --> 16:19.910
Outside's clear.

16:19.945 --> 16:21.547
Maybe they weren't expecting us.

16:21.582 --> 16:23.514
Well, let's hope not.

16:23.549 --> 16:26.317
Emma, shalimar, i want
you to go to the northeast wing.

16:26.352 --> 16:29.555
That's the place that looks most
likely they'd hold hostages.

16:29.590 --> 16:31.121
Any place in particular?

16:31.156 --> 16:33.158
Well, security's
on the third level.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.725
I'd try there first.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.362
Once we've freed the
hostages then we can turn our

16:36.397 --> 16:37.963
attentions to gaumont.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.582
Can't wait.

16:39.617 --> 16:41.166
Let's go.

16:41.567 --> 16:42.768
Where do you want me?

16:43.168 --> 16:44.770
I want you to go down
to the basement, sub level a.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.172
The central cooling room
is up the northeast stairwell.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.591
All right.

16:48.626 --> 16:49.975
I'm on my way.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.544
Uh oh.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.180
They've set up a firewall
to prevent exactly what
we're trying to do.

16:55.581 --> 16:56.382
What?

16:56.782 --> 16:58.384
So you can't
initiate a shutdown?

16:58.419 --> 16:59.985
Not from here.

17:00.386 --> 17:01.552
What?

17:01.587 --> 17:03.188
So what, you think this is
going to make me change my mind

17:03.223 --> 17:05.155
about sending you in there?

17:05.190 --> 17:06.392
I don't know. You're the genius.

17:06.791 --> 17:07.992
You got a better idea?

17:16.801 --> 17:18.002
All right. I'm in.

17:18.038 --> 17:18.804
Now where?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.406
I want you to
talk brennan through it.

17:20.806 --> 17:25.611
Okay.

17:26.011 --> 17:27.578
Brennan.

17:27.613 --> 17:30.381
Go to the door
furthest on the east.

17:30.416 --> 17:33.218
That'll take you to the
central cooling control room.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.021
They're going to try to
shut down the cooling system,

17:36.056 --> 17:37.222
they'll control it from there.

17:37.623 --> 17:40.826
Gotcha.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.849
You do realize that unless
they've got the current daily

18:03.884 --> 18:06.051
control code, shutting it
down is going to be real hard.

18:24.870 --> 18:28.474
And the hits keep coming.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.476
Well, i think i figured out
how they're planning on shutting

18:30.511 --> 18:32.077
down the cooling system.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.243
What did you say?

18:33.278 --> 18:34.480
Jesse kilmartin
is not among the group.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.046
We weren't sure, at first.

18:36.081 --> 18:37.682
But the last
communication confirms it.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.284
And why am i
hearing about this now?

18:39.319 --> 18:40.486
Sir, we still control the plant.

18:40.521 --> 18:41.652
We can...

18:41.687 --> 18:43.288
we can convince
the government to pay.

18:43.689 --> 18:46.056
The government will never pay.

18:46.091 --> 18:48.093
That was
the given, from the moment
i conceived this operation,

18:48.494 --> 18:50.896
the point was
to draw out mutant x.

18:50.931 --> 18:52.515
But they're here, sir.

18:52.550 --> 18:54.064
Without kilmartin.

18:54.099 --> 18:55.901
And without kilmartin,
we don't get the xiraxium, and

18:55.936 --> 18:57.703
without the xiraxium what
do i sell to foreign buyers?

18:58.103 --> 18:59.705
Find their frequency... jam it.

19:00.105 --> 19:02.107
Now, the other
three still inside?

19:02.142 --> 19:03.308
Yes, sir.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.676
Turn up the heat on them.

19:05.711 --> 19:08.514
Maybe they start dropping,
kilmartin will come out to play.

19:08.549 --> 19:11.717
Yes, sir.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.926
Jess, you sure you can talk
me through disarming this thing?

19:20.961 --> 19:23.293
Well, it depends if i
can get a visual on the bomb.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.131
I'm trying to bring
up the security cameras
in that area right now.

19:26.166 --> 19:26.932
Right.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.499
Wait, wait.

19:28.534 --> 19:29.735
See if you can get it online.

19:29.770 --> 19:31.301
Can you get it online?

19:31.336 --> 19:33.338
Well, so far, they've only
figured out how to block our

19:33.373 --> 19:34.940
access to the reactor controls.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.507
Whew.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.544
Well, my gut is telling me
that these are not the type of

19:38.579 --> 19:40.163
guys to make mistakes like this.

19:40.198 --> 19:42.974
Thinking they're letting us in?

19:43.009 --> 19:45.751
Well, we're about to find out.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.955
I got it.

19:49.990 --> 19:51.874
Oh, no.

19:51.909 --> 19:53.724
Okay.

19:53.759 --> 19:58.163
Brennan, try
to locate where the wires
converge on the detonator.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.730
And be careful

19:59.765 --> 20:02.167
- they might have thrown in
some dummies to throw you off.

20:02.202 --> 20:07.773
This day just keeps
getting better by the minute.

20:14.179 --> 20:16.982
Don't you think
it's a little strange we
haven't run into anyone yet?

20:17.382 --> 20:18.549
Adam?

20:18.584 --> 20:20.150
Yeah, i'm here.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.588
So we're almost at security,
and we haven't seen a soul.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.390
I don't know... either we're
incredibly lucky or something

20:25.425 --> 20:26.992
else is going on here.

20:27.027 --> 20:28.193
Oh, i know.

20:28.594 --> 20:31.396
We were getting the
same feeling back here.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.598
Brennan?

20:33.633 --> 20:35.718
Emma?

20:35.753 --> 20:37.578
Shalimar?

20:37.613 --> 20:39.404
Brennan?

20:39.805 --> 20:41.006
Adam, we've lost contact.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.573
Yeah, i know.

20:42.608 --> 20:44.810
Because our comlink signal
isn't on normal bands, they're

20:44.845 --> 20:47.012
going to have a pretty good
idea that not just any rescue

20:47.412 --> 20:48.614
force is on the premises.

20:48.649 --> 20:49.815
They know it's us.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.017
Well, unless you can
reroute the comlink signal,

20:52.052 --> 20:53.819
i can't talk brennan
through disarming the bomb.

20:53.854 --> 20:55.821
I'm working on it.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.637
They're cut off, sir.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.806
Then kilmartin knows.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.843
He's the only one
who can prevent a meltdown.

21:18.243 --> 21:19.845
Is that enough to draw him out?

21:20.245 --> 21:23.849
He doesn't get a vote.

21:27.853 --> 21:30.255
My comlink's dead.

21:30.290 --> 21:33.458
Mine, too.

21:42.267 --> 21:45.470
I'll handle this.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.476
Girl, i like you
more and more every day.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.682
Jesse, what the
hell are you doing?

21:56.717 --> 21:58.248
Take a guess, adam.

21:58.283 --> 21:59.850
If i don't get in there,

21:59.885 --> 22:01.486
gaumont's going
to take the place down,

22:01.887 --> 22:03.088
so let's just skip to
the part where you tell me what

22:03.488 --> 22:04.289
you're really thinking, huh?

22:04.324 --> 22:05.856
All right.

22:05.891 --> 22:07.492
What i'm really thinking is you
better get your ass back here.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.059
Yeah, and i was
hoping you'd wish me luck.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.096
Look, i'm not going
to take any stupid chances,

22:11.131 --> 22:12.698
but i'm going to do this, adam.

22:12.733 --> 22:14.700
You be careful.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.512
Oh.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.514
I know you can't hear me, jess,

22:29.549 --> 22:31.116
but i wish you
were here, brother.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.083
From what the colonel said,

22:33.118 --> 22:36.721
i figured you'd be
a little better than this.

22:36.756 --> 22:40.325
Well, maybe you should
listen to your colonel.

22:50.736 --> 22:53.138
Brennan mulwray.

22:53.173 --> 22:55.505
You know who i am?

22:55.540 --> 22:58.744
You'd be surprised what a fellow
with my security clearance

22:58.779 --> 23:00.746
can find out.

23:01.146 --> 23:02.748
Mission's over, gaumont.

23:02.783 --> 23:09.154
For one of us.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.156
Agghhh!

23:12.758 --> 23:15.560
Brennan!

23:18.764 --> 23:20.766
Aggh... agh.

23:20.801 --> 23:22.367
Aghhh!

23:37.883 --> 23:39.684
Get him out of the water!

23:39.719 --> 23:41.486
Do you remember your cpr?

23:41.521 --> 23:42.652
I think so.

23:42.687 --> 23:46.691
You pump... i'll blow.

23:47.893 --> 23:51.096
Come on, brennan.

23:51.897 --> 23:53.498
Come on, brennan.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.065
Come on, breathe!

23:55.100 --> 23:59.504
Come on, we're
not going to let you die.

23:59.905 --> 24:01.907
<coughing>

24:06.711 --> 24:08.913
remind me never to
do that again.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.116
That's two of us
he's almost killed.

24:11.151 --> 24:12.717
I'm taking him out myself.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.736
Shal!

24:14.771 --> 24:16.721
Wait.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.524
You really think
that's going to stop her?

24:19.559 --> 24:20.725
I'll save my breath.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.692
You okay?

24:22.727 --> 24:25.130
How much do you
know about detonators?

24:25.165 --> 24:26.731
Not much.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.298
Why?

24:28.333 --> 24:30.335
Unless somebody does, we got
about three minutes 'til this

24:30.370 --> 24:34.339
thing explodes and the
whole reactor's going to melt.

24:40.345 --> 24:42.312
Our guest has arrived.

24:42.347 --> 24:46.351
Get ready to roll out
the red carpet.

25:06.371 --> 25:09.975
Well, this wire has to be
the main connection, i'm sure.

25:10.010 --> 25:12.742
You don't feel sure, do you?

25:12.777 --> 25:15.180
Would you stay out of my
head when i'm working, please.

25:15.580 --> 25:16.781
And you're right.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.783
I'm not sure.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.387
I suppose if
jesse were here, he'd just
reach in and defuse it.

25:22.422 --> 25:25.590
But if we screw up and
it blows, then it's not just us.

25:25.625 --> 25:26.391
The whole... the
whole core melts down...

25:26.426 --> 25:27.557
okay.

25:27.592 --> 25:29.559
Can we not think
like that, please.

25:29.594 --> 25:32.797
We just need to learn how
to disconnect this thing, okay?

25:37.602 --> 25:38.368
Ow!

25:38.403 --> 25:39.569
Would you just be careful.

25:39.604 --> 25:41.606
You almost already
died once today.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.608
I'm doing my best.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.610
Whew.

26:50.875 --> 26:55.680
Man, c'mon.

26:56.081 --> 26:58.883
Hey, would you just relax, okay?

26:58.918 --> 27:01.686
You're making me nervous here.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.253
I'm sorry.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.690
I'm just used to all
my pieces being in one piece.

27:06.091 --> 27:07.692
Okay, listen.

27:08.093 --> 27:10.095
Would it make you feel
better if i told you that i...

27:10.130 --> 27:12.097
i surfed the web last night
and i figured out everything

27:12.132 --> 27:15.300
there is to know about
remotely detonated bombs.

27:15.335 --> 27:16.501
It'd be a start.

27:16.536 --> 27:18.868
Well, good.

27:18.903 --> 27:22.507
I certainly hope
that you're a better bomb
expert than you are a liar.

27:56.141 --> 27:56.941
Agh!

27:57.342 --> 27:58.143
Don't hurt me!

27:58.178 --> 27:58.908
No!

27:58.943 --> 28:00.110
It's okay.

28:00.145 --> 28:01.746
Hey. I'm here to help.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.365
I'm jesse. Come on.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.914
Sophia. Sophia taylor.

28:04.949 --> 28:07.752
When i saw those
men i hid in there.

28:07.787 --> 28:11.721
You work in the control room?

28:11.756 --> 28:14.559
Well, i'm just an assistant,
but i know all the procedures.

28:14.959 --> 28:16.160
Great.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.327
Okay.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.364
Can you help me to
shut down the core before
they make it melt down?

28:19.399 --> 28:20.783
What do you mean?

28:20.818 --> 28:22.167
They're going to...?

28:22.202 --> 28:24.186
Shh.

28:24.221 --> 28:26.171
They...

28:41.786 --> 28:43.387
agh!

28:43.422 --> 28:44.954
Agh!

28:44.989 --> 28:46.991
My god, what just happened?

28:47.026 --> 28:48.993
Are you okay?

28:49.028 --> 28:51.361
Agh!

28:51.396 --> 28:52.997
Oh, that hurt.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.964
Oh. Oh.

28:54.999 --> 28:56.801
I almost lost it.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.603
How did you do that?

28:58.638 --> 29:00.570
Oh. Hah.

29:00.605 --> 29:02.972
It's a long story.

29:03.007 --> 29:05.009
When we're finished,
i'll tell you.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.976
Okay.

29:07.011 --> 29:10.615
We need to initiate a controlled
shut down without them

29:10.650 --> 29:12.834
catching on to what we're up to.

29:12.869 --> 29:15.019
Um... you'll need access codes.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.638
Yeah, there's three.

29:16.673 --> 29:18.188
I've decrypted two.

29:18.223 --> 29:22.227
Well, i may not be able
to walk through walls, but...

29:22.262 --> 29:26.231
i bet i can help
you get the third.

29:26.631 --> 29:29.434
Okay.

29:35.840 --> 29:40.245
Brennan, jesse, shalimar,
emma, anybody copy?

29:40.645 --> 29:42.247
Someone's broken
through our scrambler,

29:42.282 --> 29:43.848
but we're intercepting
the signal.

29:44.249 --> 29:45.850
You guys read me?

29:46.251 --> 29:48.653
Loud and clear.

29:48.688 --> 29:49.819
Gaumont.

29:49.854 --> 29:51.456
And this must be adam.

29:51.856 --> 29:53.858
All right, what have
you done with my people?

29:54.259 --> 29:55.860
One or two might be dead.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.628
But the rest are doing
exactly what they should be.

29:58.663 --> 30:00.265
You actually think that
the government's going to answer

30:00.300 --> 30:01.866
your demands for a ransom?

30:02.267 --> 30:04.269
I expect that worthless bunch
of reprobates to do what they

30:04.669 --> 30:06.671
always do: Cover their asses.

30:06.706 --> 30:08.638
What the hell do you want?

30:08.673 --> 30:11.476
When this is all over,
ask your friend kilmartin.

30:11.876 --> 30:15.880
He's going to help me get it.

30:22.687 --> 30:25.890
Shouldn't be long now.

30:28.293 --> 30:31.896
Easy, kitty. Easy. Easy.

30:32.297 --> 30:35.700
You take one more step,
we're both radioactive fondue.

30:35.735 --> 30:39.103
Question is, do i believe
you're really that crazy.

30:39.138 --> 30:43.908
Damn good question.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.680
We're in.

30:50.715 --> 30:53.117
Beautiful. Okay.

30:58.323 --> 30:59.924
Uh... what is that?

30:59.959 --> 31:01.526
I don't know.

31:01.926 --> 31:04.329
Controlled reactor shut
down in t minus 16 seconds.

31:04.729 --> 31:13.538
14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8...

31:15.540 --> 31:18.343
kaboom.

31:23.948 --> 31:25.950
Brennan?

31:33.858 --> 31:35.460
Gaumont must have
triggered the bomb remotely.

31:35.495 --> 31:37.061
Shal must not
have gotten to him.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.680
Unless they got to her first.

31:38.715 --> 31:40.265
Hey, don't even go there.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.431
There.

31:41.466 --> 31:42.667
It's the cooling system.

31:42.702 --> 31:44.234
The cooling system.

31:44.269 --> 31:46.070
Gaumont's blown
the cooling system.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.872
The explosion
aborted the shutdown.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.073
How long until the meltdown?

31:49.474 --> 31:50.640
Ten minutes max.

31:50.675 --> 31:51.876
Is there a backup system?

31:51.911 --> 31:53.443
No such thing.

31:53.478 --> 31:55.880
The only way is to physically
disengage the xiraxium rods to

31:55.915 --> 31:58.683
interrupt the chain
reaction before meltdown.

31:58.718 --> 31:59.849
How?

31:59.884 --> 32:01.085
It's impossible.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.087
The reactor's behind a foot
and a half of reinforced steel.

32:03.488 --> 32:06.691
There's no way in.

32:06.726 --> 32:09.894
Yeah.

32:13.898 --> 32:16.266
Meltdown's under way, shalimar.

32:16.301 --> 32:19.103
There's only one man
in the world that can stop it.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.322
You?

32:20.357 --> 32:21.532
Me?

32:21.567 --> 32:22.707
No.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.909
He's on your side.

32:24.944 --> 32:26.676
He's on the premises.

32:26.711 --> 32:31.516
Now, let's hope that
he's getting the job done.

32:34.319 --> 32:37.121
Get her in there.

32:38.323 --> 32:40.725
Come on.

32:52.737 --> 32:55.940
Gaumont knew that the
government had no intention
of paying his demands.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.542
It's a common procedure.

32:57.942 --> 32:59.909
We always assumed
he had a deeper plan.

32:59.944 --> 33:01.946
A deeper plan that included
knowledge of my team.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.948
You know, with jesse
poised to play a pivotal role.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.515
I don't understand.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.952
From what i'm getting
from the online linkup to the

33:08.353 --> 33:10.755
facility, gaumont has put
the reactor into meltdown mode.

33:10.790 --> 33:12.357
And what does that
have to do with him?

33:12.757 --> 33:14.759
The only way to shut it down
is to access the core and the

33:14.794 --> 33:16.978
only person who
can access the core,

33:17.013 --> 33:19.163
by walking through
steel walls, is...

33:19.564 --> 33:20.765
jesse.

33:21.165 --> 33:23.367
Gaumont is after the
xiraxium from the reactor.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.887
We have handed it
to him on a silver platter.

33:25.922 --> 33:28.373
The xiraxium bundle's
inside the reactor.

33:28.408 --> 33:30.340
Okay.

33:30.375 --> 33:31.976
You looked pretty
rough last time.

33:32.011 --> 33:33.543
Are you sure you can do this?

33:33.578 --> 33:37.582
Well, i guess
we'll soon find out.

33:48.393 --> 33:50.395
Shal?

33:50.795 --> 33:52.597
Brennan!?

33:52.632 --> 33:55.517
Shal.

33:55.552 --> 33:58.403
Back up.

34:04.409 --> 34:05.975
What took you?

34:06.010 --> 34:08.012
Well, you know, we stopped for
a beer and a bucket of wings.

34:08.047 --> 34:08.813
Come on.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.616
Come on.

34:20.024 --> 34:24.829
Hey. Good luck.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.957
I knew you could do it, jesse.

36:32.992 --> 36:34.524
Are you okay?

36:34.559 --> 36:36.561
I'm a little wiped.

36:51.776 --> 36:56.981
Nice work, sergeant.

36:57.016 --> 36:58.948
Thank you, sir.

36:58.983 --> 37:02.151
And thank you, mr. Kilmartin.

37:02.186 --> 37:05.790
I understand you accomplished
this at great risk to yourself.

37:06.190 --> 37:08.592
Wish i had more
men with your capability.

37:08.627 --> 37:12.013
Unfortunately,
you're on the wrong side,

37:12.048 --> 37:15.399
and you're too
dangerous to let live.

37:30.214 --> 37:33.217
Jess.

37:33.252 --> 37:35.737
Adam!

37:35.772 --> 37:37.998
Brennan.

37:38.033 --> 37:40.189
Thank god.

37:40.224 --> 37:41.791
All right, so what's going on?

37:41.826 --> 37:42.992
Jesse phased
and he can't get back.

37:43.027 --> 37:45.029
All right, how long
has he been like that?

37:45.064 --> 37:46.230
Less than a minute.

37:46.631 --> 37:48.197
All right.

37:48.232 --> 37:49.834
His system cannot
take much more than that
length of time in that stage.

37:50.234 --> 37:53.437
If he doesn't become
tangible soon he's going
to dissipate into thin air.

37:53.472 --> 37:57.441
Come on, jess!

38:00.544 --> 38:02.111
We're losing him.

38:02.146 --> 38:03.748
Brennan, i want you
to try to create an electrical

38:03.783 --> 38:05.314
shield around his body.

38:05.349 --> 38:06.550
That could keep him
from dissipating completely.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.953
Jess, stay with us!

38:08.988 --> 38:10.519
Come on!

38:10.554 --> 38:12.556
<coughing> come
on, work with me, jess!

38:12.591 --> 38:13.322
Come on!

38:13.357 --> 38:14.924
Come on, jess.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.560
Come on, jesse, look at me.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.162
Come on, jesse, focus!

38:18.197 --> 38:20.129
Focus!

38:20.164 --> 38:22.566
<coughing> c'mon.

38:22.601 --> 38:23.367
C'mon.

38:23.768 --> 38:24.568
Adam, we got him.
We got him.

38:24.603 --> 38:25.735
Great.

38:25.770 --> 38:26.971
Get him out of this thing.

38:27.371 --> 38:28.572
You okay?

38:28.607 --> 38:29.739
Adam.

38:29.774 --> 38:30.940
Gaumont got the xiraxium.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.977
That's been his plan all
along, and he knew that you were

38:33.012 --> 38:34.578
the only guy who could
go in and get it for him.

38:34.613 --> 38:36.180
This guy's been
manipulating us all along.

38:36.215 --> 38:39.383
That's about to change.

39:04.608 --> 39:05.810
We gotta make
it to the double helix.

39:06.210 --> 39:08.612
Quick. Come on!

39:18.222 --> 39:19.789
Call barrington.

39:19.824 --> 39:21.425
Make sure he's got the cash.

39:21.460 --> 39:25.029
Make sure he's ready.

39:35.439 --> 39:37.441
Colonel, they're on us.

39:37.476 --> 39:41.045
Not for long.

39:48.652 --> 39:50.053
We gotta stop them.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.455
Take the controls.

39:51.856 --> 39:53.022
What are you doing, jess?

39:53.057 --> 39:54.658
I can send
out an electromagnetic
pulse beam from the

39:54.693 --> 39:56.260
helix's generator
and cut out their motors.

39:56.295 --> 39:57.426
What?

39:57.461 --> 39:59.028
It's going to
take out our motor, too.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.465
Just be ready to land this
thing when i give you the word.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.672
What the hell's he doing?

40:08.707 --> 40:11.075
I don't know.

40:11.876 --> 40:17.481
Now!

40:35.499 --> 40:36.700
No power?

40:36.735 --> 40:37.902
No.

40:38.302 --> 40:40.304
Where's jesse?

40:48.312 --> 40:51.115
Your plan was perfect
except for one minor flaw.

40:51.150 --> 40:52.681
Me.

40:52.716 --> 40:54.718
You should've laid down
when you had the chance, jesse.

40:54.753 --> 40:57.521
Do you really think
i'd let you stop me?

40:57.556 --> 40:59.088
No need to.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.724
Taken care of that yourself.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.928
You forgot to turn off
your laser defense system.

41:07.531 --> 41:10.734
Sweet mother of...

41:37.161 --> 41:39.128
well, according
to my diagnostics,

41:39.163 --> 41:41.165
the nerve gas has dissipated
completely from your system.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.968
You don't know how
good it feels to hear that.

41:44.368 --> 41:46.770
Well, dodged a
major bullet, brother.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.737
Uh, we've dodged 'em before.

41:48.772 --> 41:50.574
Yeah, but not
like this one, honey.

41:50.609 --> 41:52.376
It was awfully
brave of you back there.

41:52.411 --> 41:54.378
Risking your life for all of us.

41:54.778 --> 41:57.181
Yeah, even i have to admit
is was, you know, pretty cool.

41:57.216 --> 42:00.349
Ah, what can i say,
kid's still got it, uh?

42:00.384 --> 42:02.786
Yeah, let's make sure
you never lose it again, uh?
