00:01.437 --> 00:03.889
I can't believe
I'm talking to a therapist.

00:05.250 --> 00:08.252
Well, usually, I'm not
the touchy-feely,

00:08.253 --> 00:10.271
talk-about-your-emotions type,

00:10.272 --> 00:14.191
but with this, I just had
to be a big enough person

00:14.192 --> 00:17.278
to admit that I need help.

00:17.279 --> 00:20.781
Huh. I guess this is what
growing up feels like.

00:20.782 --> 00:23.634
This is court-mandated therapy.

00:24.269 --> 00:25.669
You assaulted a woman.

00:25.670 --> 00:27.404
Oh...

00:27.405 --> 00:29.089
That silly thing.

00:29.958 --> 00:31.875
I guess we can talk about that.

00:31.876 --> 00:33.544
It all began a few months ago.

00:33.545 --> 00:37.715
<i>There's this guy, Barney.</i>
<i>We used to date.</i>

00:37.716 --> 00:40.601
<i>I set him up with this girl</i>
<i>I work with, Nora.</i>

00:40.602 --> 00:42.937
Barney was working hard

00:42.938 --> 00:45.606
to prove he was
real boyfriend material.

00:45.607 --> 00:49.610
So, all week, I had to sit there
watching him...

00:49.611 --> 00:51.862
<i>send flowers...</i>

00:54.983 --> 00:56.650
<i>chocolates...</i>

01:00.104 --> 01:01.655
<i>balloons.</i>

01:05.794 --> 01:07.661
<i>Then one day...</i>

01:08.363 --> 01:10.297
Hey...

01:10.298 --> 01:13.584
I heard Barney didn't send
anything today.

01:13.585 --> 01:16.503
Patrice said
maybe he met somebody else.

01:16.504 --> 01:19.640

01:24.596 --> 01:29.149

He's so dreamy.

01:30.151 --> 01:32.603
Nobody asked you, Patrice!

01:32.604 --> 01:35.305
I'm sorry.
You must already think

01:35.306 --> 01:36.573
that I'm a horrible person.

01:36.574 --> 01:39.243
Robin, many of my patients
are disturbed felons.

01:39.244 --> 01:42.279
Last week, one of them mailed me
a bag of his feces.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.114
On the plus side,
he remembered my birthday.

01:44.115 --> 01:45.833
You're doing fine.

01:45.834 --> 01:49.169
Well, finally, I-I just
couldn't take it anymore.

01:49.170 --> 01:50.254
I snapped.

02:07.138 --> 02:08.856
Not exactly.

02:24.962 --> 02:26.045
So, you're drunk

02:26.046 --> 02:28.864
under a desk, binge-eating
stolen chocolates.

02:28.865 --> 02:31.217
Boy, I am not coming
across great here, am I?

02:31.218 --> 02:33.469
This is not about how
you're coming across.

02:33.470 --> 02:34.537
But no.

02:34.538 --> 02:36.756
Okay, well, for this story
to make sense,

02:36.757 --> 02:39.342
I have to tell you about
my friends Marshall and Lily.

02:39.343 --> 02:41.594
The wine looks good.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.897
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

02:44.898 --> 02:46.733
pregnant women
can't drink alcohol.

02:46.734 --> 02:47.934
No, my doctor says it's okay

02:47.935 --> 02:50.319
to have a sip of wine
every now and then.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.154
Really?

02:51.155 --> 02:52.605
Dr. Sonya's great.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.358
Whenever you ask her if you can
have something, she's, like...

02:55.359 --> 02:58.394
Just a little bit.

02:58.395 --> 03:00.947
Wait, Dr. Sonya doesn't let
you have sushi, does she?

03:00.948 --> 03:03.232
Just a little bit.

03:04.168 --> 03:05.284
You're allowed
to have Cheetos?

03:05.285 --> 03:07.453
Cheetos...

03:07.454 --> 03:09.672
Ah, just a little bit.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.091
You mind if I double-check

03:12.092 --> 03:13.543
some of this stuff
just in case?

03:13.544 --> 03:15.461
I mean, it's the least
I could do

03:15.462 --> 03:17.296
as part of Team Baby.

03:17.297 --> 03:19.298
"Team Baby"?
Whoa. What's next,

03:19.299 --> 03:21.434
like, cheesy
matching T-shirts?

03:22.553 --> 03:26.922
No.

03:26.923 --> 03:28.558
Robin, I've had serial killers
lead me

03:28.559 --> 03:31.093
to shallow graves faster
than you're telling this story.

03:31.094 --> 03:34.647
Okay! Look, it was getting
impossible for me

03:34.648 --> 03:37.483
to be around Nora,
so when an opportunity

03:37.484 --> 03:39.202
to get rid of her
presented itself...

03:39.203 --> 03:41.103
It's Sandy time!

03:41.104 --> 03:42.488
Huddle up, gang.

03:42.489 --> 03:45.107
Two things: 1) Somebody stole

03:45.108 --> 03:47.109
a very expensive bottle of wine
from my office...

03:50.831 --> 03:54.450
2) I need a producer to cover
the G8 Summit in France.

03:54.451 --> 03:55.468
Nora will do it!

03:55.469 --> 03:58.304
I mean, I know I have
seniority, but...

03:58.305 --> 04:00.139
I was gonna ask Nora anyway.

04:00.140 --> 04:03.726
Thanks for the support, Robin.
This is huge for me.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.580
Are, are you
sure about this, Sandy?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.182
I <i>do</i> have seniority.

04:09.183 --> 04:12.235
Oh, I'm sure. Nora's amazing.

04:12.236 --> 04:14.737
I want to have sex with her.

04:15.639 --> 04:17.990
To deal with that rejection
from Barney,

04:17.991 --> 04:19.742
not to mention your boss...

04:19.743 --> 04:21.444
must've really hurt.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.413
Why don't we dig
into those emotions?

04:25.666 --> 04:28.367
So Marshall and Lily were
at Dr. Sonya's office...

04:31.455 --> 04:32.672
It's fascinating

04:32.673 --> 04:36.926
how profoundly little I know
about vaginas.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.161
DR. SONYA
Come in.

04:39.162 --> 04:41.547
Ted, what are you
doing here?!

04:41.548 --> 04:43.165
I checked up on all the stuff

04:43.166 --> 04:47.103
this "doctor" says is okay,
and she's wrong.

04:47.104 --> 04:51.691
So, for the health of this baby,
I'm stepping in.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.526
Sounds like this Ted guy could
benefit from some therapy.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.911
Oh, he definitely could.

04:54.912 --> 04:56.262
This is unacceptable.

04:56.263 --> 04:58.514
I'm sorry, we're gonna have
to find a new doctor.

04:58.515 --> 05:00.483
Guys, for the health
of our baby,

05:00.484 --> 05:02.318
Our?
we have to get serious

05:02.319 --> 05:04.186
about what Lily is
putting in her body.

05:04.187 --> 05:06.038
Speaking of which,
when we deliver,

05:06.039 --> 05:07.623
we won't be using any drugs.

05:07.624 --> 05:08.875
Get out!

05:08.876 --> 05:10.859
Why are you kicking me out?!

05:10.860 --> 05:14.046
Because you're always intruding
on our intimate moments!

05:14.047 --> 05:17.032
This is like college
all over again!

05:19.019 --> 05:21.036
Man, you guys
sure are messy!

05:21.037 --> 05:22.221
There's clothes everywhere.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.674
There's even a sock
on the door!

05:24.675 --> 05:27.977
A sock on the door
is a universal code

05:27.978 --> 05:29.228
for "We need some space."

05:29.229 --> 05:31.764
We needed it back then,
and we need it now.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.599
Come on! We're a trio!

05:33.600 --> 05:34.984
We've always been a trio!

05:34.985 --> 05:37.520
We're right up there with Batman
and Robin and Alfred.

05:37.521 --> 05:38.738
Out!

05:38.739 --> 05:41.107
Romeo and Juliet
and the Apothecary.

05:41.108 --> 05:41.941
Now!

05:41.942 --> 05:45.244
Salt and Pepper and Cumin!

05:45.245 --> 05:48.114
What's that little guy
up there do?

05:48.115 --> 05:49.231
Oh, you poor girl.

05:50.066 --> 05:51.000
Robin!

05:51.001 --> 05:52.368
It all ties together, I swear.

05:52.369 --> 05:55.204
So, Nora was about
to leave for France.

05:55.205 --> 05:56.739
You know, not
too long ago,

05:56.740 --> 05:57.957
I would have
been worried

05:57.958 --> 05:59.375
that if I left you alone,

05:59.376 --> 06:02.261
you'd be up to no good
with some blond bimbo.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.796
Oh, I've changed.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.715
I know, which is why
when I get back,

06:05.716 --> 06:08.083
it's gonna be the start
of a new chapter for us.

06:08.084 --> 06:10.753
A chapter of me and you
and hopefully not that tie.

06:10.754 --> 06:12.021
You got me!

06:12.022 --> 06:14.056
Have a nice trip!

06:15.475 --> 06:17.443
Dr. Stinson?
I saw your ad,

06:17.444 --> 06:19.862
and I'm here for my free
breast-reduction consultation.

06:19.863 --> 06:22.531
What do you think?

06:22.532 --> 06:25.534
Are they too big?

06:30.727 --> 06:33.840
I can't believe you're still
running plays on dumb blondes!

06:33.841 --> 06:35.475
I thought you were
serious about Nora!

06:35.476 --> 06:37.043
No, I've been good, I swear!

06:37.044 --> 06:39.512
I just forgot about my BDSes.

06:39.513 --> 06:43.183
- BDSes?
- Bimbo Delivery Systems.

06:43.184 --> 06:46.553
You see, over the years,
I've launched a variety

06:46.554 --> 06:49.606
of elaborate systems that are
always working to get me laid.

06:49.607 --> 06:51.858
Like my pop-up ads.

06:51.859 --> 06:55.278
Oh, hi.
I'm Dr. Barney Stinson.

06:55.279 --> 06:57.096
Are your really large breasts

06:57.097 --> 06:58.698
making everyday tasks difficult?

06:58.699 --> 07:00.767
Oh!

07:00.768 --> 07:02.935
There's just got
to be a better way!

07:02.936 --> 07:04.287
There is!

07:04.288 --> 07:07.741
I, Dr. Barney Stinson,
for a limited time only,

07:07.742 --> 07:11.044
can give you a free
breast-reduction consultation.

07:11.045 --> 07:12.545
Call me.

07:12.546 --> 07:14.297
If your knockers are
just too damn big,

07:14.298 --> 07:17.617
I can handle them... it.

07:17.618 --> 07:19.619
Women actually
fell for that?

07:19.620 --> 07:21.471
Yeah.
That business really took off.

07:21.472 --> 07:23.506
It played in all kinds
of markets.

07:28.813 --> 07:31.681
Okay, survivors,
today's reward challenge

07:31.682 --> 07:34.818
is brought to you by
Dr. Barney Stinson's

07:34.819 --> 07:36.319
Free Breast Reduction
Consultations.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.371
That scam was
so successful,

07:38.372 --> 07:40.607
it spawned a related enterprise.

07:41.809 --> 07:44.744
If you've been fooled
by a well-endowed man

07:44.745 --> 07:45.912
who claimed to be a doctor

07:45.913 --> 07:49.482
offering free breast-reduction
consultations,

07:49.483 --> 07:52.752
come see me, Arnie Linson,
attorney-at-law,

07:52.753 --> 07:55.755
and join my class-action suit.

07:55.756 --> 07:57.690
If your giant breasts
have been wronged,

07:57.691 --> 08:01.511
I can handle them... it.

08:01.512 --> 08:03.930
I got 'em comin' and goin'!

08:03.931 --> 08:06.332
Uh-huh.

08:06.333 --> 08:08.184
I can't believe you go

08:08.185 --> 08:10.437
to so much trouble
to get laid.

08:10.438 --> 08:12.272
Yeah, sometimes I don't
even have to shower.

08:12.273 --> 08:14.190
Mama loves it musky.

08:14.191 --> 08:17.227
I gotta shut down all these
systems before Nora gets back.

08:17.228 --> 08:19.562
How am I gonna do all that
in three days?

08:19.563 --> 08:20.980
I'll help you.

08:20.981 --> 08:24.150
Maybe you should write
on your little chart there:

08:24.151 --> 08:27.537
"Patient selflessly tried
to help a friend in need."

08:27.538 --> 08:30.523
First of all, this is
a crossword puzzle.

08:30.524 --> 08:32.958
Secondly, you were clearly
planning on using

08:32.960 --> 08:34.409
those three days
to steal Barney back.

08:34.410 --> 08:37.996
I am his friend! How dare you!

08:37.998 --> 08:40.884
God, you think you're so smart
just because

08:40.885 --> 08:42.368
you went to Harvard

08:42.369 --> 08:43.870
and then Princeton

08:43.871 --> 08:46.473
and then... wow,
Harvard again.

08:46.474 --> 08:47.924
Okay, yes, fine.

08:47.925 --> 08:50.176
I was... I was trying
to steal him back.

08:50.177 --> 08:51.811
This is good.
You're finally opening up

08:51.812 --> 08:52.896
and talking about yourself,

08:52.897 --> 08:54.881
not just what Marshall
and Lily were up to.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.883
Oh, yeah, so Marshall and Lily
were folding laundry...

08:56.884 --> 08:59.102
That one's my fault.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.521
You know...

09:01.522 --> 09:04.223
Never mind.

09:05.576 --> 09:06.493
It's just...

09:06.494 --> 09:08.578
Forget it.

09:09.446 --> 09:11.080
Marshall, you're
a grown-ass man.

09:11.081 --> 09:13.366
If you want to say
something, just say it.

09:13.367 --> 09:15.618
I feel bad for Ted!
And if my mom were here,

09:15.619 --> 09:16.903
she would ask me what was wrong.

09:16.904 --> 09:19.255
You feel bad for Ted?!

09:19.256 --> 09:21.574
It's tough feeling
like the third wheel.

09:21.575 --> 09:24.410
Okay, first of all,
I'm sure Ted's fine.

09:24.411 --> 09:28.681
Who eats salt and pepper
without cumin?

09:30.217 --> 09:33.603
Second, Ted is way off base
coming after Dr. Sonya.

09:33.604 --> 09:35.188
We love her! Right?

09:38.976 --> 09:41.761
Don't tell me
you're doubting Dr. Sonya!

09:41.762 --> 09:43.863
Just a little bit.

09:44.648 --> 09:46.265
What's that thing?

09:46.266 --> 09:48.768
Well, for some women, it was
the ashes of my parents.

09:48.769 --> 09:51.771
For others, it was the trophy
from Wimbledon.

09:51.772 --> 09:55.959
And believe it or not, for
one busty dullard, it was both.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.611
Game, enormous set, match.

10:01.048 --> 10:02.749
Hello?

10:02.750 --> 10:04.417
Oh, yeah, thanks
for calling me back.

10:04.418 --> 10:05.451
Uh, Barney,

10:05.452 --> 10:07.887
It's Mitch
from the Port Authority.

10:10.724 --> 10:16.262
Port Authority Mitch.
You'd always call me whenever

10:16.263 --> 10:18.481
a wide-eyed farm girl
would get off the bus

10:18.482 --> 10:21.651
with big dreams of Broadway
and no idea

10:21.652 --> 10:24.136
what a "casting director"
could legally ask her to do,

10:24.137 --> 10:26.155
hold or lick during an audition.

10:26.156 --> 10:28.591
I'm sorry, old friend,

10:28.592 --> 10:31.077
your services are
no longer needed.

10:31.078 --> 10:35.582
Oh, God, I can't believe
I'm doing this over the phone!

10:36.250 --> 10:38.952
My love to Marge and the kids!

10:40.421 --> 10:41.771
I know. Here.

10:41.772 --> 10:44.791
I didn't realize this would be so hard!
I know, I know.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.492
But hey, you know what? We're
almost through our checklist.

10:46.493 --> 10:47.994
- Okay? Okay?
- Okay.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.178
Which reminds me,

10:49.179 --> 10:51.381
why am I calling a hair salon
and saying,

10:51.382 --> 10:53.600
"Jack Fantastic is quitting"?

10:53.601 --> 10:54.934
Sweetheart,

10:54.935 --> 10:57.437
it's like Maya Angelou
keeps telling Oprah,

10:57.438 --> 10:59.138
and I keep telling you:

10:59.139 --> 11:02.809
When you know better,
you do better.

11:02.810 --> 11:05.528
Wow, you are so wise.

11:05.529 --> 11:08.781
I wish you were straight
so I could date you.

11:08.782 --> 11:11.484
Well...

11:11.485 --> 11:16.406
as a matter of fact, I have
an extremely attractive

11:16.407 --> 11:20.710
straight twin brother!

11:23.363 --> 11:26.132
Oh, hi.

11:26.133 --> 11:27.984
I cropped that Halloween photo.

11:27.985 --> 11:31.888
It's just salt and pepper, now,
so it looks ridiculous.

11:31.889 --> 11:34.257
Ted, I want you back on Team Baby.
What?

11:34.258 --> 11:35.658
I knew you'd come around!

11:35.659 --> 11:37.927
Guys! I didn't really
crop the photo!

11:37.928 --> 11:39.762
Plus...

11:39.763 --> 11:41.014
Good news.

11:41.015 --> 11:43.182
I signed us up for
a birthing class.

11:43.183 --> 11:44.934
Well, that's insane.

11:44.935 --> 11:47.236
It's way too early for
that, right, Marshall?

11:47.237 --> 11:50.523
Okay, listen. I am the
father of this child,

11:50.524 --> 11:52.608
and I vote that we go
to the birthing class.

11:52.609 --> 11:54.610
Absolutely not.

11:54.611 --> 11:56.062
'Kay, Lily.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.031
I hate to play this card...

11:58.032 --> 12:01.167
but if you don't
come to this class...

12:01.168 --> 12:02.669
I'm withholding sex.

12:02.670 --> 12:04.037
I don't think she's coming.

12:04.038 --> 12:05.421
Yeah.

12:05.422 --> 12:08.341
I was a little suspicious when
she had us take separate cabs.

12:10.911 --> 12:12.295
Lily, don't do it!

12:12.296 --> 12:14.347
Just a little bit.

12:14.348 --> 12:16.516
Think about our baby!

12:18.185 --> 12:20.520
You got to be kidding me,
Robin. Get to the assault.

12:20.521 --> 12:22.605
Okay, fine.

12:22.606 --> 12:25.041
So Barney and I were finishing
packing his apartment...

12:25.042 --> 12:28.778
Okay. One last item
on the checklist.

12:28.779 --> 12:30.863
Disconnect the Cold Call 5000.

12:30.864 --> 12:32.732
What the hell's that?

12:32.733 --> 12:35.201
I was able to secure the
customer database from a company

12:35.202 --> 12:37.403
that sells body glitter
and high-end pasties.

12:37.404 --> 12:41.708
The Cold Call 5000 will
dial every female client

12:41.709 --> 12:44.610
between the ages of 22 and 23,

12:44.611 --> 12:45.778
and leave the following message:

12:45.779 --> 12:47.497
Hi, I know this is crazy,

12:47.498 --> 12:50.583
but I saw you on the subway,
and I knew we were meant to be.

12:50.584 --> 12:53.669
If you believe in destiny,
come to MacLaren's tonight

12:53.670 --> 12:55.304
and find me, Barney Stinson.

12:55.305 --> 12:58.341
Because I have this feeling that
I'm supposed to be on you--

12:58.342 --> 12:59.559
with you.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.627
Why not re-record it?

13:01.628 --> 13:03.813
I did like a hundred takes.
It kept happening.

13:06.266 --> 13:08.101
I can't believe
Lily's not coming!

13:08.102 --> 13:09.635
You know what? Screw it!

13:09.636 --> 13:12.438
Who says that two bros
can't rock a birthing class?

13:12.439 --> 13:14.173
Rock it!

13:15.242 --> 13:19.529
Today, we'll be exploring
"The Sensual Massage."

13:19.530 --> 13:22.915
Let's start by gently cupping
our partner's hands...

13:29.156 --> 13:31.340
and just breathe each other in.

13:38.015 --> 13:39.498
Thanks, Robin.

13:39.499 --> 13:42.101
You're the only person I know
who would help me do all that.

13:42.102 --> 13:44.053
You're a real bro.

13:44.054 --> 13:45.304
Am I, though?

13:45.305 --> 13:48.524
'Cause I'm really
more of a woman.

13:48.525 --> 13:49.976
To my femininity.

13:49.977 --> 13:52.728
Nah, you're more of a bro.

13:52.729 --> 13:55.731
You're a dude.
You're a man.

13:58.018 --> 14:02.288
Hey, you are flying
solo one more night.

14:02.289 --> 14:04.824
How about I put on
a smokin' hot dress,

14:04.825 --> 14:08.578
you slap a vest over
that crime scene of a tie

14:08.579 --> 14:09.796
and we paint the town?

14:09.797 --> 14:12.131
I mean, when was the last time
we got rip-roaring drunk

14:12.132 --> 14:14.801
in clothing that
highlights our genders?

14:15.702 --> 14:17.753
So, your plan was to
be out on the town,

14:17.754 --> 14:21.174
dressed provocatively, drinking
with another woman's man.

14:22.075 --> 14:23.876
Robin, this is our
first session, and

14:23.877 --> 14:27.130
I know this is just one
clinical opinion, but...

14:27.131 --> 14:29.048
you a dawg!

14:29.049 --> 14:30.650
Yeah...

14:30.651 --> 14:32.185
There was just one problem...

14:32.186 --> 14:33.336
Surprise!

14:33.337 --> 14:34.821
I got back early!

14:34.822 --> 14:36.973
Hey!

14:38.725 --> 14:41.410
<i>Let me guess,</i>

14:41.411 --> 14:43.329
you got drunk
under your desk again?

14:43.330 --> 14:47.950
No, Mr. Harvard. I handled
things a little differently...

14:49.000 --> 14:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:56.685 --> 14:59.689
So, I suppose now you want me
to talk about how it felt

14:59.987 --> 15:02.833
watching Barney and Nora
walk off together, right?

15:03.193 --> 15:05.728
I'd rather just skip ahead
to the assault.

15:05.729 --> 15:07.096
My next patient thinks he's God.

15:07.097 --> 15:08.514
On the off chance
that he's right,

15:08.515 --> 15:10.149
I really don't want
to keep him waiting.

15:10.150 --> 15:13.853
Well, right after they left,
something crazy happened.

15:13.854 --> 15:19.192
Excuse me, do you know where
I can find Barney Stinson?

15:19.193 --> 15:22.578
He saw me on the subway and left
me a message to meet him here.

15:23.580 --> 15:25.397
Why not re-record it?

15:25.398 --> 15:27.583
I did like a hundred takes.
It kept happening.

15:35.292 --> 15:36.492
Hi, I know this is crazy,

15:36.493 --> 15:37.710
but I saw you on the subway...

15:37.711 --> 15:41.798
He asked me if I believed
in destiny. And I do.

15:41.799 --> 15:44.416
We are so meant to be.

15:44.417 --> 15:46.135
Where can I find him?

15:47.221 --> 15:49.088
So I was faced
with a moral dilemma.

15:49.089 --> 15:51.691
Unleash this nut bag on them

15:51.692 --> 15:55.361
or be a bigger person,
and help my friend.

15:55.362 --> 15:57.814
Barney's at Café L'Amour,
75th and Amsterdam.

15:57.815 --> 16:00.283
- Awesome!
- No, wait, wait, wait!

16:00.284 --> 16:02.318
Okay, this isn't right.

16:02.319 --> 16:05.822
Let's pop that top
button, show off your gals.

16:05.823 --> 16:08.040
Ooh! Good luck, go get 'em!

16:09.626 --> 16:13.079
Let your love come
through your fingers.

16:15.082 --> 16:16.382
Dude, the rule is no moaning

16:16.383 --> 16:18.084
and keep your eyes
open at all times.

16:18.085 --> 16:20.336
Stop being weird.

16:20.337 --> 16:22.421
And hey, when do I
get to be the woman?

16:22.422 --> 16:26.392
Now remember, the most
important thing in pregnancy

16:26.393 --> 16:28.644
is to keep Mom calm and happy.

16:28.645 --> 16:30.730
She knows best what she needs.

16:30.731 --> 16:31.747
Trust her.

16:31.748 --> 16:34.433
Now, Papas,

16:34.434 --> 16:36.986
I want you to take
Mom's hands in yours,

16:36.987 --> 16:40.072
look deep into her eyes,

16:40.073 --> 16:41.941
and repeat after me.

16:41.942 --> 16:44.110
I believe in you.

16:44.111 --> 16:46.162
I believe in you.

16:46.163 --> 16:48.981
I honor your body's wisdom.

16:50.784 --> 16:52.752
I honor your body's wisdom.

16:52.753 --> 16:55.371
Your womb is a temple.

16:55.372 --> 16:58.674
- Your womb is a--
- Okay, I get it!

16:58.675 --> 17:01.427
I feel terrible we didn't
listen to what Lily wanted!

17:01.428 --> 17:02.762
I know, so do I.

17:02.763 --> 17:05.681
The truth is, I thought
I'd be married by now

17:05.682 --> 17:08.300
and going through all this
stuff alongside you guys.

17:08.301 --> 17:11.387
But even if I meet the girl of
my dreams right this second,

17:11.387 --> 17:13.672
I'm still one night
and nine months away

17:13.673 --> 17:15.308
from having a family
of my own.

17:15.309 --> 17:17.276
And that's assuming the
mother of my children

17:17.277 --> 17:19.194
is just a huge slut.

17:20.063 --> 17:21.396
Don't lose hope, Ted.

17:21.397 --> 17:24.183
That slut is out there.

17:24.184 --> 17:25.867
Thanks, buddy.

17:25.868 --> 17:27.319
We owe Lily an apology.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.570
Yeah.

17:30.824 --> 17:34.126
Dads, this is the time that
I'll answer every question

17:34.127 --> 17:36.212
you've ever had about vaginas.

17:36.213 --> 17:38.381
Damn it!

17:42.386 --> 17:43.702
Hey.

17:43.703 --> 17:45.805
I'm so sorry, Lily.

17:45.806 --> 17:49.558
You have just a little bit.

17:55.349 --> 17:58.601
I realize now that it's my job
for the next seven months

17:58.602 --> 18:02.355
to keep you happy,
and that's why...

18:02.356 --> 18:05.141
I'm no longer withholding sex.

18:05.142 --> 18:07.660
My hero.

18:07.661 --> 18:10.229
But I want to make sure
that you feel comfortable

18:10.230 --> 18:11.364
with Dr. Sonya, too.

18:11.365 --> 18:12.615
I do. And you know what,

18:12.616 --> 18:14.583
the fact that she's so calm
and laid back,

18:14.584 --> 18:16.002
maybe that's not a bad thing.

18:16.003 --> 18:17.503
Maybe that's exactly
what we're gonna want

18:17.504 --> 18:19.005
in that delivery room.

18:19.006 --> 18:23.376
Lily, if you don't push, I will
shove this baby up your throat

18:23.377 --> 18:25.161
and pull it out of your mouth!

18:27.381 --> 18:29.215
Where the hell is Marshall?!

18:29.216 --> 18:31.500
<i>That's a crazy story, kids.</i>

18:31.501 --> 18:32.935
<i>I'll get to that.</i>

18:32.936 --> 18:36.055
Hey, Ted's out
in the hall.

18:36.056 --> 18:38.257
He wants to apologize, too.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.315
Hey.

18:46.316 --> 18:48.734
What happened to your sock?

18:48.735 --> 18:51.787
Long story. Bottom line,
I realized that sometimes

18:51.788 --> 18:54.707
love means taking a step back.

18:54.708 --> 18:57.159
Well, not always.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.462
I mean, sometimes it's
better to interfere

18:59.463 --> 19:01.613
and sabotage stuff, right?

19:01.614 --> 19:04.083
Well, I think if you
care about somebody,

19:04.084 --> 19:05.634
you should want them
to be happy,

19:05.635 --> 19:07.887
even if you wind up
being left out.

19:07.888 --> 19:09.955
Wow.

19:09.956 --> 19:12.425
The lesson you learned
with Lily and Marshall

19:12.426 --> 19:14.927
is directly applicable
to my situation,

19:14.928 --> 19:16.262
and is therefore

19:16.263 --> 19:19.065
a valid part of how I'll
eventually tell this story.

19:19.066 --> 19:20.132
<i>Really?</i>

19:20.133 --> 19:21.534
That's how that went down?

19:21.535 --> 19:25.337
Point is, it all
tied together, right?

19:25.338 --> 19:26.739
Not really at all.

19:26.740 --> 19:28.691
Can we just get to the assault?

19:29.359 --> 19:30.659
To us!

19:30.660 --> 19:32.028
Barney, it's me!

19:32.029 --> 19:34.246
I love you, Barney!

19:35.082 --> 19:36.449
Mmm, scallops look good.

19:36.450 --> 19:37.750
Oh, they are.

19:37.751 --> 19:40.286
But the last time I was here
they ran out, so, uh...

19:40.287 --> 19:43.339
knock... on... wood.

19:44.424 --> 19:47.710
Well, I have my eye on the
red velvet cake for dessert.

19:47.711 --> 19:49.879
Lovely. Splitsies?

19:49.880 --> 19:52.381
Nah, I want it
all to myself.

19:52.382 --> 19:53.599
Really?

19:53.600 --> 19:54.767
Arm wrestle for it?

19:54.768 --> 19:55.718
No!

19:56.720 --> 19:58.387
All right.

19:58.388 --> 19:59.522
I love this place.

19:59.523 --> 20:01.107
- Thank you, babe.
- You're welcome.

20:01.108 --> 20:02.691
Babe.

20:02.692 --> 20:05.361
Barney doesn't know a thing
about any of this.

20:05.362 --> 20:09.281
But that's why I got
court-mandated therapy.

20:10.784 --> 20:12.184
You must think I'm nuts.

20:12.185 --> 20:15.404
I think you're
a really good friend.

20:15.405 --> 20:17.039
Really?

20:17.040 --> 20:18.324
Really.

20:18.325 --> 20:20.576
As far as I'm concerned,
there was no criminal intent

20:20.577 --> 20:21.944
to this assault.

20:21.945 --> 20:24.080
Well, thanks, Doc!

20:25.265 --> 20:27.383
Well, look at us!

20:27.384 --> 20:29.251
We got this wrapped up
in one session.

20:29.252 --> 20:31.337
Go us, right?

20:31.338 --> 20:33.205
Now let's discuss how you
keyed the judge's car.

20:33.206 --> 20:35.141
Okay. Um...

20:35.142 --> 20:36.392
Here's how it happened:

20:36.393 --> 20:38.377
Marshall and Lily were supposed
to go to the zoo--

20:38.378 --> 20:41.263
okay, it all ties together,
I swear. Now...
