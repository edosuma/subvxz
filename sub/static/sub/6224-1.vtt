00:02.544 --> 00:05.832
Great dragon:
In a land of myth and a time of magic...

00:06.006 --> 00:07.837
The destiny of a great kingdom...

00:08.007 --> 00:11.045
Rests on the shoulders of a young man.

00:11.220 --> 00:14.053
His name: Merlin.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.067
Hello!

00:29.571 --> 00:30.856
Hello?

00:44.169 --> 00:45.284
Oh, sorry.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.256
- Well?
- I've searched everywhere.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.792
Well, then, it's not just me
you're keeping waiting.

00:53.971 --> 00:57.054
- How is it my fault?
- The queen can't just disappear.

00:57.224 --> 01:00.091
- Where is she?
- That's what I sent you to find out.

01:00.269 --> 01:02.976
- Do you know how big this castle is?
- Funny enough, I do.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.977
Then perhaps you should have a look.

01:05.147 --> 01:07.981
Merlin, is there anything
you're actually capable of doing?

01:08.569 --> 01:09.934
- Putting up with you.
Gwen: Ahem.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.943
Oh, well...

01:12.114 --> 01:14.321
Arthur: Guinevere.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.153
I ate”? Not at all.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.783
Plenty of time.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.666
Arthur:
Noble knights of Camelot...

01:30.841 --> 01:32.832
Countrymen...

01:33.594 --> 01:34.959
Friends.

01:35.762 --> 01:39.095
I welcome you to this meeting
of the round table.

01:40.392 --> 01:43.509
For three long years
we have been blessed

01:43.687 --> 01:46.053
with peace and prosperity...

01:46.815 --> 01:49.522
But now it seems
3 shadow has been cast

01:49.693 --> 01:50.933
across our lands.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.648
Sir Gwaine set off for ismere.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.188
Some six weeks ago.

01:57.868 --> 02:01.577
With him went threescore of our finest men.

02:03.415 --> 02:06.748
There has been ho word from them since.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.352
Run!

02:52.214 --> 02:54.705
At my request, sir elyan
led a search party...

02:54.883 --> 02:56.839
To the wastelands of the north.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.426
He found no trace of Gwaine or his men.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.840
It is as if they have vanished
from the face of the earth.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.883
Ruadan:
The last of the Camelot patrol.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.593
How long before Arthur sends more?

04:27.768 --> 04:30.134
Calm yourself.
There's nothing to worry about.

04:30.312 --> 04:31.973
You're wrong.
We're running out of time.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.432
Prophesies do not lie.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.768
Arthur's bane is real.
Once it is known to us.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.582
- His end is nigh.
- So you keep saying.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.226
Yet you cannot tell me what it is.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.020
The diamair will tell us.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.656
The diamair is
the key to all knowledge.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.074
Then where is this key?

04:47.954 --> 04:49.535
It is here, beneath your feet.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.782
For three months we've been searching,
and what have we found?

04:52.959 --> 04:54.074
Nothing.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.584
It is but a moment compared
to the eternity of knowledge...

04:56.755 --> 05:00.418
- The key will bring.
- If I find that you've lied to me...

05:00.592 --> 05:03.299
Patience is the stepping stone
to wisdom, morgana.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.337
You think I don't know that,
after all that I've been through?

05:06.515 --> 05:09.973
For two long years,
I saw nothing but darkness.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.802
Patience and I are old friends.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.654
Gwaine: Lady morgana.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.524
We really have to stop meeting like this.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.242
You're not looking so pretty now,
are you, sir knight?

05:37.420 --> 05:39.126
It would appear not.
“Arthur should know.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.288
Not to send his men so far north.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.836
Well, get on with it then.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.966
Kill me. “I will

05:46.137 --> 05:48.924
but first you're going to have
to help me find something.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.991
We know Gwaine and his men
crossed the pass here...

06:10.161 --> 06:12.402
At isulfor, but beyond that...

06:12.581 --> 06:14.867
There was no trace. The trail went cold.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.499
What of this story that the fortress
of ismere has been occupied once more?

06:18.670 --> 06:22.834
I heard many rumors, sire.
All of them had one name in common:

06:23.008 --> 06:24.214
Morgana.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.848
- Then we have no time to lose.
Gaius: Whether the rumors are true, sire...

06:30.974 --> 06:32.930
You may be walking into a trap.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.996
Arthur: The knights of Camelot
do not abandon their own.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.477
Morgana knows that.
She'll be waiting for you.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.434
These men have fought for me,
bled for me.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.395
May I make a suggestion?

06:42.569 --> 06:44.981
What if you were to take a different route?

06:45.155 --> 06:46.861
Approach ismere from the west.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.238
Arthur: Through annis' lands?

06:49.409 --> 06:52.196
Gaius: It would certainly
take morgana by surprise.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.991
Would annis Grant safe passage
to so many armed men?

06:55.498 --> 06:57.034
I believe she would, sire.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.127
Dispatch a rider immediately.
We'll follow at dawn.

07:03.298 --> 07:07.041
Remember, if we're to succeed,
no one must know of our intentions.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.682
Sorry.

07:21.066 --> 07:24.900
It's fine, really.
I'm the one who should apologize.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.777
- What for?
- I keep getting you into trouble.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.729
Ah

07:29.908 --> 07:31.068
I'm used to it.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.491
Arthur: Merlin!

07:35.330 --> 07:37.010
You should hear him
when he's really angry.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.072
Arthur: Merlin!

07:39.250 --> 07:40.786
I ike now.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.536
If you need help with anything...

07:46.299 --> 07:47.914
Let me know.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.844
Thank you.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.690
Merlin: Do you really think...

08:11.741 --> 08:13.697
Gwaine and percival could still be alive?

08:13.868 --> 08:15.404
I have to find out.

08:15.578 --> 08:18.695
They're knights of the round table.
It's a bond we share.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.163
I understand.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.955
If it was you that disappeared, Merlin,
I wouldn't bother.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.594
Did you find the others?

08:35.765 --> 08:38.677
- Every last one.
- Do they know what we're searching for?

08:38.852 --> 08:41.558
- Some kind of key.
- Key to what?

08:46.026 --> 08:49.644
I don't know, but the men say
morgana's obsessed.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.732
She won't rest until she finds it.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.988
Let's hope we don't succeed then.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.948
The gorge marks the start of annis' lands.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.742
Elyan:
It's prime ambush territory.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.630
Take some men, follow the ridgeline.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.368
Something you need to see.

10:27.585 --> 10:32.170
Voice: Emrys...

10:44.185 --> 10:48.053
Emrys.

11:00.743 --> 11:05.703
Man: Emrys.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.492
What happened to you?

11:46.372 --> 11:48.078
Who did this to your village?

11:48.249 --> 11:50.581
That it happened at all...

11:50.752 --> 11:53.164
1s all that matters.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.329
I have been haunted
by this moment...

11:57.091 --> 11:59.377
For many years.

12:00.261 --> 12:04.675
Since long before you set foot
on this earth, emrys...

12:05.850 --> 12:09.968
I have waited for its arrival
with sorrow in my heart.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.892
For even as Camelot flowers

12:17.070 --> 12:21.313
so the seeds of her destruction
are being sown.

12:22.909 --> 12:27.619
The prophets speak of Arthur's bane.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.997
You would do well to fear it.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.658
For it stalks him.

12:33.836 --> 12:37.044
Ilke a ghost in the night.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.215
Unless you act quickly, emrys...

12:42.220 --> 12:45.087
Even you cannot alter...

12:48.643 --> 12:51.134
Of his.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.182
Fate.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.161
Arthur: Is he alive?

13:53.333 --> 13:54.823
What is it?

14:01.424 --> 14:03.506
Come on, Merlin.
You've seen a dead body before.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.836
As soon as we give these people
a proper burial, we're moving out.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.789
Oh, dragon!

14:53.893 --> 14:56.509
I need to know about a druid symbol.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.388
A black spiral,
within it a thin yellow coil.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.269
It is the Mark of a vates.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.852
A druid seer.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.903
Where did you encounter him?

15:08.074 --> 15:09.689
On my journey here.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.949
He warned me of Arthur's bane.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.364
His bane?

15:15.873 --> 15:18.410
And then he showed me a battle

15:19.919 --> 15:21.784
a terrible battle.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.045
Arthur was fighting for his life.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.498
I saw him wounded.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.883
And I saw him fall.

15:29.053 --> 15:32.045
The vates' power of prophecy
is unrivaled.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.048
Even by a high priestess.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.926
So this battle will come to pass?

15:38.104 --> 15:42.438
I do not know, young warlock,
but one thing is certain:

15:42.608 --> 15:45.350
This was no chance meeting.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.526
You think I should heed his warning?

15:50.950 --> 15:56.741
There was a time when the words of a vates
were considered a qift.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.364
Then why do they feel like a burden?

15:59.542 --> 16:04.161
A wise man is not cowed
by knowledge, Merlin.

16:04.922 --> 16:08.961
Instead he uses it to guide him.

16:10.511 --> 16:14.174
- How?
- That is something only you can decide.

16:14.348 --> 16:18.808
But remember,
the vates singled you out for a reason.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.098
Now more than ever.

16:21.272 --> 16:25.936
It is you and you alone
that can keep Arthur safe.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.741
Arthur: Queen annis.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.831
Arthur pendragon.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.873
I'm most grateful that you've allowed us
safe passage through your kingdom.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.550
We are allies, Arthur...

16:53.429 --> 16:55.215
And these are troubled times.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.568
I can't eat this. I'm sorry.

17:10.738 --> 17:14.026
I'll get you something else, my lady.
No.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.441
If you could just sit with me.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.031
Are you hungry?

17:27.630 --> 17:28.961
Eat, please.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.014
You love him, I understand.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.042
Do you have someone you worry about?

17:46.816 --> 17:48.932
But not someone you can talk about?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.191
No, my lady.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.856
There's no greater warrior than the king.

17:57.743 --> 17:58.983
He will return.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.277
I know.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.537
You're right. Thank you.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.287
Annis:
What you saw at asgorath is no surprise.

18:11.465 --> 18:14.298
Some months ago saxons began
raiding our villages.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.751
They're rounding up
all the men they can find...

18:16.929 --> 18:18.339
And taking them to ismere.

18:18.931 --> 18:19.966
Arthur: To raise an army.

18:20.141 --> 18:23.349
People say morgana is
tearing the citadel apart.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.473
- Why?
- She must be searching for something.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.480
I dare not think what.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.016
Then my men may still be alive.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.152
Yes, there's every chance.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.274
I think it's time for some entertainment.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.490
I would love to see your fool perform.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.701
Given all his failings,
he must have some skills.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.749
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

18:49.503 --> 18:50.913
You heard the queen.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.162
Jump to it.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.004
- I'm not a fool.
- That's debatable

18:59.055 --> 19:01.512
and I don't have any skills.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.885
I know that,
but we can't refuse the queen...

19:04.060 --> 19:06.551
When she's granted us safe passage,
can we”?

19:41.889 --> 19:43.345
Audience: Ooh!

20:19.802 --> 20:23.636
Where did you learn to juggle like that?
Honestly, I didn't even know you could catch.

20:23.806 --> 20:29.142
Yes, well, I have many talents.
You fail to notice them, that's all.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.971
Come on, out with it. What's wrong?

20:38.529 --> 20:40.019
I'm not sure we should go to ismere.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.611
Did you not hear annis? My men are alive.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.241
You don't know that.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.772
Stick to juggling, Merlin.
Leave the important things to me.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.029
- But...
- Here.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.790
See”? Explain that.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.836
Wish I could

22:30.599 --> 22:33.432
It's me it's sefa.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.680
- I didn't mean to frighten you.
- Fear

22:39.859 --> 22:42.896
is in here.
No one can make you feel fear.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.685
Do you understand?

22:45.948 --> 22:48.030
You have something to tell me?
Yes.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.237
- Arthur has set out for ismere.
- As I expected.

22:51.412 --> 22:54.324
But he's approaching from the west,
through annis' land.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.618
You're sure? Certain.

22:56.792 --> 23:00.080
- When did he leave?
- Yesterday at dawn.

23:01.046 --> 23:04.004
- Shall I come with you?
- Your disappearance will create suspicion.

23:05.009 --> 23:08.718
- What would you like me to do?
- You've served your purpose for now.

23:16.270 --> 23:18.932
I hope they haven't ill-treated you.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.893
- They have been good to me, father.
- They are pendragons.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.229
They are good for one thing only:

23:24.403 --> 23:25.688
Death.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.179
Morgana has been devoured by hate.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.810
Be careful.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.266
I will

24:02.816 --> 24:04.477
(good allies are hard to find.

24:04.652 --> 24:06.734
I'd hate to lose one.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.955
Gwen:
Aren't you forgetting something?

24:27.216 --> 24:30.674
My papers for the council.
“Of course.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.719
Are you all right? Yes.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.755
You don't seem yourself today.

24:36.934 --> 24:37.969
I'm sorry.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.222
Last night...

24:43.482 --> 24:45.814
I saw you leave the city.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.272
- I, um...
- Sefg

24:49.780 --> 24:52.647
I may be the queen, but you don't
have to hide your secrets from me.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.361
My lady?

24:56.745 --> 24:58.701
Whoever he is, he's lucky to have you.

25:00.708 --> 25:01.788
Thank you, my lady.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.618
There are so many things to remember.

25:05.796 --> 25:08.913
I know that better than anyone.
You're doing well, honestly.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.131
Thank you, my lady.

25:38.495 --> 25:39.780
What is it?

25:41.206 --> 25:44.573
- What's wrong?
- Arthur is riding for ismere as we speak.

25:44.752 --> 25:48.461
Impossible. I've had sentries posted
at the border for weeks

25:48.630 --> 25:51.246
he's approaching from the west,
from annis' lands.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.916
- Why would he do that?
- He means to surprise you.

25:54.094 --> 25:57.507
He will be on us in less than a day.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.637
Prepare for battle.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.050
We ride tonight.

26:29.671 --> 26:30.706
Merlin

26:38.847 --> 26:41.554
How can they laugh and joke?

26:41.725 --> 26:43.056
Hm?

26:44.603 --> 26:47.140
Don't they know what we
will face in ismere?

26:50.359 --> 26:52.099
Yeah, of course.

26:53.362 --> 26:56.445
But a warrior learns to enjoy
each day as it comes.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.027
Because he knows it might be his last.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.701
Why are you so upset?

27:08.252 --> 27:10.288
Morgana is powerful.

27:10.462 --> 27:13.329
- She's dangerous.
- I know.

27:13.507 --> 27:14.667
And you don't care?

27:17.511 --> 27:19.126
Only about my men.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.719
They're more than friends.

27:21.890 --> 27:25.724
They're more than brothers.
No matter what lies ahead of me

27:25.894 --> 27:30.183
I won't abandon them,
as I know they would not abandon me.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.016
I understand.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.400
I wish I didn't.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.273
But I do.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.041
Come and have some food.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.397
- We're surrounded.
- We can't stay here.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.716
Run!

30:48.889 --> 30:49.924
What happened?

30:51.016 --> 30:52.631
Unh. You don't remember?

30:55.145 --> 30:57.978
Where are the others? Leon, elyan?

30:59.232 --> 31:01.894
There was nothing I could do.
I had to get you to safety.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.689
- What actually happened?
- The usual: I saved your neck.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.695
You saved me? Yes.

31:11.870 --> 31:15.783
And I can juggle. I keep telling you
I have many talents.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.493
So it would seem

31:22.506 --> 31:23.541
come on.

31:45.278 --> 31:46.313
Percival

31:47.155 --> 31:48.770
percival?

31:50.492 --> 31:51.857
What?

31:54.454 --> 31:55.614
There's something out there.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.285
Did you see that?

32:00.877 --> 32:02.117
Who's that?

32:27.154 --> 32:28.154
Could we have a break?

32:28.321 --> 32:31.028
As long as it's quick.
I want to reach ismere before dark.

32:31.199 --> 32:35.033
Ismere”? We are heading back to Camelot.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.068
Navigation is not your strong point, is it?

32:37.247 --> 32:39.408
Camelot is south. The sun rises where”?

32:39.583 --> 32:40.698
In the east.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.676
And what have we been
walking towards all day?

32:42.836 --> 32:45.498
To our deaths! The two of us
against morgana... are you mad?

32:45.672 --> 32:49.210
- I told you. I'm going to rescue my men.
- No!

32:53.305 --> 32:55.136
If you're afraid...

32:55.307 --> 32:57.218
- Then go.
- I'm worried about you.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.240
Right, well, I've tried
sending you home...

33:00.395 --> 33:03.387
But if you're not going to do as I ask,
the least you can do is shut up.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.686
Come on.

33:07.861 --> 33:10.477
You know, if morgana doesn't kill you,
I will

33:10.655 --> 33:13.112
threatening your king is treason, Merlin.

33:13.283 --> 33:16.446
- What about threatening an ass?
- I heard that!

33:24.753 --> 33:25.993
Leon: We were ambushed.

33:26.171 --> 33:29.629
Morgana and a band of saxons attacked us
as we crossed the border into ismere.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.091
And what of Arthur?

33:32.594 --> 33:34.130
I tried to protect him.

33:34.971 --> 33:38.008
- What are you saying?
Elyan: We lost him in the battle

33:38.600 --> 33:41.262
we don't know what happened to him.
Or Merlin.

33:44.314 --> 33:46.100
How could morgana have known?

33:46.274 --> 33:49.812
How could she have known that Arthur
was approaching from that direction?

33:51.571 --> 33:53.607
Someone betrayed us.

33:59.996 --> 34:02.783
Merlin: Arthur? - Hm?

34:03.792 --> 34:06.204
I need to tell you something.

34:08.505 --> 34:11.621
The man... the old man in the village...

34:11.800 --> 34:15.964
- Just think about something else, Merlin.
- No, I need you to listen to me.

34:16.721 --> 34:19.463
Before he died, he tried to warn me.

34:19.641 --> 34:21.757
He told me that you were in danger...

34:21.935 --> 34:25.177
- And that the danger was close.
- He was dying, Merlin.

34:25.355 --> 34:29.063
- It is what he would say.
- I think he was a druid seer.

34:29.943 --> 34:32.480
You expect me to listen to a sorcerer?

34:33.862 --> 34:38.322
Why would he tell me that?
He had no knowledge that I even knew you.

34:44.958 --> 34:48.371
- We have to turn back.
- I can't.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.706
Fven if what he said were true

34:51.880 --> 34:54.569
- it makes no difference.
- Arthur, without you Camelot is nothing.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.505
All that we worked so hard to create,
everything we've begun...

34:59.472 --> 35:03.966
Look, no matter what adversity we face,
we stand for what is right.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.556
To betray our beliefs, Merlin...

35:06.730 --> 35:10.143
That is what will destroy
everything we've strived for.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.062
I swear I'm going to rescue my men...

35:13.945 --> 35:15.560
Or die trying.

35:17.574 --> 35:21.408
And I swear I will protect you
or die at your side.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.811
It's back.

35:55.945 --> 35:59.153
- Where are you going?
- Cover for me.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.088
Morgana:
Don't just stand there, find them!

37:43.303 --> 37:45.510
I don't care how long it takes.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.768
Arthur: If only we had a horse.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.057
Merlin: Or a pig.

37:59.569 --> 38:02.311
- You can't ride a pig.
- No, but we could roast it...

38:02.489 --> 38:05.071
With carrots, parsnips and apples.
Merlin.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.041
No, you're right.
We won't waste those apples.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.363
- We'll put them in a pie.
- Stop it.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.619
I have to eat something.

38:14.751 --> 38:15.751
Rabbits?

38:20.924 --> 38:22.255
Merlin!

38:31.935 --> 38:32.970
I got them.

38:51.204 --> 38:52.990
What have I done”?

38:53.164 --> 38:54.904
The night before Arthur set out
for ismere

38:55.083 --> 38:57.083
there was a meeting
of the king's privy council.

38:57.252 --> 38:58.958
Did you hear what was said?

38:59.128 --> 39:01.961
- No, my lady.
- Yet you were standing right outside the door.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.006
I was bringing your supper.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.919
- Later that night, where did you go?
- Nowhere.

39:09.097 --> 39:11.304
Don't make this hard on yourself.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.339
All I want is the truth.

39:13.518 --> 39:16.351
We both know you left the city
through the Southern gate.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.011
I ook at me.

39:19.482 --> 39:20.892
Do you deny it?

39:22.610 --> 39:23.975
No, my lady.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.815
Who did you see?

39:30.451 --> 39:32.112
You can tell me.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.199
- You wouldn't understand.
- Who did you see?

39:38.334 --> 39:41.201
My father. I saw my father.

39:42.463 --> 39:45.876
- And you told him what you'd heard?
- He only wants what's rightfully his.

39:46.050 --> 39:51.386
Were he a physician or a warrior,
his skills would be revered. But sorcery?

39:52.724 --> 39:54.806
He deserves respect like any man.

39:54.976 --> 39:56.386
Respect is to be earned.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.685
It cannot be bought with blood.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.264
Your treachery cost
the lives of many good men.

40:03.651 --> 40:06.688
- I... I didn't mean to.
- You have admitted your guilt.

40:07.447 --> 40:08.937
You leave me no choice, sefa.

40:11.159 --> 40:14.526
By the laws of Camelot,
I find you quilty of treason.

40:14.704 --> 40:16.160
No

40:16.998 --> 40:18.363
I sentence you to death.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.082
Take her to the cells.

40:38.102 --> 40:40.383
Merlin: What are you doing?
- If I could reach my sword...

40:40.480 --> 40:42.436
We'll be able to cut the rope.
Merlin: Unh.

40:42.607 --> 40:43.687
Don't put your knee there.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.268
Arthur: Where? Merlin: Aah!

40:49.238 --> 40:51.695
Merlin! Argh!

40:51.866 --> 40:53.731
Merlin: That was your fault.

40:53.910 --> 40:56.196
- That was your fault.
Arthur: You... you...

41:04.837 --> 41:06.202
(Reat.

41:07.382 --> 41:09.043
Just great.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.753
Where'd the other rabbit go?

42:08.985 --> 42:11.567
I'm sorry. Did we wake you?

42:11.738 --> 42:14.354
Not so fast

42:21.914 --> 42:24.200
The king of Camelot.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.866
You will fetch a handsome price...

42:27.420 --> 42:29.376
Alive or dead.

42:34.010 --> 42:37.423
- Any last requests?
- Let my servant go.

42:37.889 --> 42:40.221
He doesn't deserve to die like this.

42:47.023 --> 42:49.560
Merlin:
If you're going to kill him...

42:49.734 --> 42:52.601
You'll have to kill me first.
Arthur: Merlin.

42:52.779 --> 42:55.942
Step aside.
You know I never do as I'm told.

43:15.426 --> 43:18.589
Shouldn't we leave it to the lady morgana
to decide their fate?

43:37.031 --> 43:39.443
You don't remember me, do you?

43:41.869 --> 43:43.825
You saved my life once...

43:43.996 --> 43:45.452
Many years ago.

43:46.999 --> 43:48.079
Mordred.

43:54.257 --> 43:56.043
Hello, Arthur.

44:09.939 --> 44:11.975
Mordred:
You fear me, emrys, don't you?

44:12.150 --> 44:14.687
For good or ill,
albion's great trial has begun.
