WEBVTT

00:18.119 --> 00:19.687
Tell me he's asleep.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.821
Dr. Byers saw to that.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.723
Gave him Percocet
before she left.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.293
If I were her, and he called me
in at 2:00 in the morning,

00:25.326 --> 00:26.327
I would have killed him.

00:36.370 --> 00:40.341

PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

00:40.374 --> 00:44.378
and CBS

01:39.167 --> 01:42.336
( phone ringing )

01:46.407 --> 01:47.141
Yeah. It's Gibbs.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.446
No, you did not
wake me up, DiNozzo.

01:53.481 --> 01:56.150
Mm-hmm.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.351
Okay, I'll meet you there.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.721
Hey,

02:00.754 --> 02:02.256
can you drop me
by Bethesda?

02:06.460 --> 02:07.828
Ho. You got here quick.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.163
Where were you?

02:09.197 --> 02:10.398
Home asleep.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.532
Asleep, maybe,
but not at home.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.566
I got you on your cell.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.368
Drop it, DiNozzo.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.636
Do not make this
a challenge, Kate.

02:15.669 --> 02:16.370
I will find out.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.472
Uh-oh.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.342
See ya.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.377
Looks like you and I
were the only ones

02:23.411 --> 02:25.313
flying solo
last night, McGee.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.347
Speak for yourself.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.183
Oh...

02:29.217 --> 02:30.551
'Morning, Boss.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.752
Where?

02:31.785 --> 02:32.920
First floor.
A-wing.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.356
TONY:
Some kind of explosion.
Guy went up in flames.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.724
Name?

02:36.757 --> 02:37.825
Commander Michael Dornan,

02:37.858 --> 02:40.394
Safety Officer
on the Kennedy.

02:40.428 --> 02:41.395
It just got back
from the Gulf.

02:41.429 --> 02:42.930
Yeah, Friday.
Been complaining of chest pain.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.798
Had open heart surgery
four days ago.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.235
Doctor who led the team
that operated on him

02:47.268 --> 02:47.935
is on the way in.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.403
I'll talk to him.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.771
Uh, that would be
a her, boss.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.706
Commander Janice Byers.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.811
Hup close, McGee.

02:57.845 --> 02:58.879
Come on!

03:00.414 --> 03:01.449
Whoa,

03:01.482 --> 03:02.750
that had to hurt.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.253
Oh...

03:05.286 --> 03:06.554
What the hell happened
here, Duck?

03:06.587 --> 03:07.388
The source

03:07.421 --> 03:08.456
of the conflagration

03:08.489 --> 03:09.723
appears to be internal.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.626
The majority of the damage

03:12.660 --> 03:15.963
is confined
to the torso.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.431
KATE:
He was receiving oxygen

03:17.465 --> 03:18.799
through a nasal canula.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.234
Still, it would
have needed

03:20.268 --> 03:21.469
a source of ignition

03:21.502 --> 03:22.936
and I seriously doubt it
could've caused

03:22.970 --> 03:24.372
this kind of damage.

03:25.473 --> 03:26.907
Could he have been smoking
in bed?

03:26.940 --> 03:28.242
TONY:
Corpsman saw him

03:28.276 --> 03:29.477
ten seconds before
the explosion.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.611
Dornan was out cold.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.316
Hey, boss...

03:35.349 --> 03:36.584
Listen, I know
this may sound

03:36.617 --> 03:37.451
far-fetched, but...

03:37.485 --> 03:39.753
Will you spit it out, McGee?

03:39.787 --> 03:41.522
Spontaneous
human combustion.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.261
Where's the surgeon?

03:47.295 --> 03:48.396
She's in the waiting room.

03:48.429 --> 03:48.996
Just got here.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.464
Probie,

03:50.498 --> 03:51.499
what are you
thinking?

03:51.532 --> 03:52.733
Spontaneous
human combustion?!

03:52.766 --> 03:54.502
It's an urban myth.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.570
DUCKY:
Actually, Tony,
we shouldn't

03:56.604 --> 03:58.038
disregard the notion.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.840
Stories of the phenomenon
go way back--

03:59.873 --> 04:00.908
to the Bible, in fact.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.543
Although it wasn't
popularized

04:02.576 --> 04:04.745
until Dickens.

04:04.778 --> 04:05.846
Charles Dickens?
Yes.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.648
He used spontaneous
combustion

04:07.681 --> 04:11.619
to kill off one
of his characters, Mr. Krook,

04:11.652 --> 04:14.855
in the novel Bleak House.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.526
It caused a minor uproar.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.660
Dickens was accused

04:19.693 --> 04:20.928
of perpetuating

04:20.961 --> 04:22.830
the age-old superstition.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.965
I saw that movie.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.534
DUCKY:
The silent version

04:26.567 --> 04:27.735
or the British mini-series?

04:28.569 --> 04:29.903
They were talking.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.606
( scoffs )

04:32.640 --> 04:35.309
Commander Dornan was
complaining of pain.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.677
He insisted
the night staff
call me in.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.078
"Insisted"?

04:38.111 --> 04:40.381
The commander liked to throw
his weight around,

04:40.414 --> 04:42.783
especially with
the junior nurses
and the corpsmen.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.453
Normal post-op pain?

04:45.486 --> 04:47.688
To appease him, I did
an echocardiogram

04:47.721 --> 04:48.522
and he was fine.

04:48.556 --> 04:49.957
I gave him a Percocet
for the pain

04:49.990 --> 04:50.958
so he could fall sleep.

04:50.991 --> 04:51.859
DUCKY:
Oh, Jethro,

04:51.892 --> 04:52.860
I'll be... uh...

04:52.893 --> 04:53.661
You headed back?
Yeah.

04:53.694 --> 04:54.695
Commander Byers,

04:54.728 --> 04:55.696
this is Dr. Mallard,

04:55.729 --> 04:57.798
our M.E.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.601
Dr. Byers is the surgeon
that operated on the victim.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.669
DUCKY:
Oh!

05:08.776 --> 05:09.943
Dr. Mallard's

05:09.977 --> 05:11.645
a man of few words.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.013
I don't have any
more questions

05:13.046 --> 05:14.382
for you right now,
Doctor.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.449
Thank you
for your time.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.717
Sure.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.986
What exactly
was the procedure?

05:19.019 --> 05:20.488
Aortic valve repair.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.690
Congenital aortic
stenosis?

05:22.723 --> 05:23.791
Acquired.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.726
Ah...
and the prognosis?

05:25.759 --> 05:26.894
Everything went well.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.563
I was expecting Commander Dornan
to be back on active duty

05:29.597 --> 05:30.498
in two months.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.999
Ah... thank you.

05:35.936 --> 05:40.541
Uh, I may have to ask
you a question or two

05:40.574 --> 05:41.509
after the autopsy.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.512
I'll give you my numbers.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.754
Too bad you didn't get to bed
at a sensible hour.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.122
I mean, to sleep,

05:55.155 --> 05:56.457
cause obviously,
you were in bed.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.460
I get it, Tony.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.494
McGee...
Yeah, boss?

06:00.528 --> 06:01.529
Stay here.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.596
Meet with the engineers
and the plant manager.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.633
I want this oxygen system
completely checked out.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.967
Okay.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.736
Everything in this room
goes back to Abby.

06:08.769 --> 06:09.770
Everything?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.773
Right.
Hey!

06:12.806 --> 06:14.608
Background the victim.

06:17.110 --> 06:20.914
This is the beginning
of a very long day.

06:20.948 --> 06:24.452
Yeah. Too bad you had
such a short night.

06:27.821 --> 06:32.960
I must say, I was very intrigued

06:32.993 --> 06:34.695
by your doctor.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.098
I'm not quite sure why.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.167
Did you find her that way, too?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.702
Looks like he burned
from the inside out.

06:41.735 --> 06:45.606
It does, doesn't it,
Mr. Palmer?

06:45.639 --> 06:46.874
Oh, that's

06:46.907 --> 06:48.041
the remains of his stomach.

06:48.075 --> 06:51.178
Make sure they get
to Abigail for
content analysis.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.582
Uh, Doctor?

06:54.615 --> 06:55.616
Yes?

06:55.649 --> 06:58.552
Does it help you
to talk to them?

06:58.586 --> 07:01.489
They're still human.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.791
What we do is very invasive

07:03.824 --> 07:05.626
and impersonal.

07:05.659 --> 07:08.028
It helps me establish
a relationship.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.635
ABBY:
Hey, Gibbs.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.803
I hear you're not
a fan of SHC.

07:15.836 --> 07:16.804
That a band?

07:16.837 --> 07:18.772
( laughing ):
No.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.741
Spontaneous
human combustion.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.042
Don't waste
my time, Abbs.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.511
If you read my Master's thesis,

07:23.544 --> 07:24.578
you may become a believer.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.579
Doubt it.

07:25.613 --> 07:26.446
I can show you photos

07:26.480 --> 07:28.482
of what was left
of a 240-pound woman.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.550
Yeah, but you won't.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.918
She was sitting
in a chair.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.754
All that was left
were blackened seat springs,

07:33.787 --> 07:34.822
a section of backbone,

07:34.855 --> 07:36.590
one foot-- still in
a satin slipper--

07:36.624 --> 07:38.526
and ten pounds of ashes.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.494
The rest of her apartment
was untouched.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.829
Abby, you know what?

07:41.862 --> 07:44.765
Just tell me
what caused the explosion.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.967
Ooh! A bribe!

07:47.000 --> 07:48.235
That always works.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.202
So I checked out

07:49.236 --> 07:50.804
all the electrical equipment
from the hospital,

07:50.838 --> 07:52.105
trying to find
the source of ignition.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.174
Nothing; everything's
in perfect working order,

07:54.207 --> 07:55.743
including this monitor,

07:55.776 --> 07:57.077
which recorded
the victim's vitals

07:57.110 --> 07:58.712
up until the point
of blastoff.

07:58.746 --> 07:59.713
Uh-huh...

07:59.747 --> 08:00.447
Somebody went
a little postal

08:00.480 --> 08:01.314
with the fire
extinguisher.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.584
It complicates
finding trace evidence.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.653
The commander was
being barbecued.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.721
I doubt they were concerned
with forensics.

08:07.755 --> 08:08.656
True.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.858
You don't know what caused
the explosion?

08:10.891 --> 08:12.593
Other than SHC?

08:12.626 --> 08:15.663
All right,
get with Ducky.

08:15.696 --> 08:16.764
Maybe together
you can solve it.

08:16.797 --> 08:17.965
Roger that.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.801
When he's finished slicing
and dicing, we'll go bang heads.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.604
Don't cause any sparks.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.639
No, that's more
than enough for now.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.640
Thanks for your
time, Doctor.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.176
I was thinking
of becoming a doctor.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.178
KATE:
You. A doctor.

08:31.211 --> 08:34.214
Anthony DiNozzo,
comma...

08:34.247 --> 08:35.916
M.D.

08:35.949 --> 08:36.950
( laughs )

08:36.984 --> 08:39.553
Let me guess: a gynecologist.

08:39.587 --> 08:42.089
Ooh, no, I was thinking
more dermatologist.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.691
Normal hours. Big bucks.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.825
Never an emergency.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.827
I mean,
nobody ever died from a zit.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.629
I had a terrible case of acne
as a kid.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.763
Of course you did, Probie.

08:49.797 --> 08:53.300
Boss, plant engineer says oxygen
is supplied to the rooms

08:53.333 --> 08:54.835
through a central system.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.804
They did
a complete check

08:56.837 --> 08:57.705
and everything was in order.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.673
Day shift
concurred with night shift:

08:59.707 --> 09:00.874
The commander was a pain
in the ass.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.009
( cell phone ringing )

09:02.042 --> 09:03.811
Divorced,

09:03.844 --> 09:05.713
ten years ago,
no kids.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.815
Wife's happily remarried,
living in Santa Fe...

09:11.885 --> 09:12.853
Um...

09:12.886 --> 09:13.987
Parents are retired.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.022
One sister,

09:15.055 --> 09:16.790
and they're being notified
by CACO. DiNozzo...

09:16.824 --> 09:18.859
Harrison...?

09:21.328 --> 09:23.096
Hi.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.131
It's Harrison.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.699
KATE:
Um...

09:25.733 --> 09:26.800
I'm glad you called.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.774
DUCKY:
I never cease
to be amazed

09:33.807 --> 09:35.308
by your skill,
Abby

09:35.342 --> 09:37.711
You know, when I was
a young M.E.,

09:37.745 --> 09:41.081
we used to recreate
crime scenes using interns.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.083
You also used to listen
to "records"

09:43.116 --> 09:44.317
and do the jitterbug.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.020
Actually, I was quite
the hoofer.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.656
( humming )

09:52.726 --> 09:53.526
Let's see it, Abbs.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.328
Based on the condition
of the body,

09:55.362 --> 09:57.097
the burn patterns
and debris scatter,

09:57.130 --> 09:59.066
we were able to recreate
the explosion.

10:03.737 --> 10:04.772
Doesn't tell us much.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.808
Watch when I rotate it 180
and play it in slo-mo.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.213
That's the point
of ignition.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.915
What caused
the explosion?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.083
Well, this was taken

10:16.116 --> 10:17.818
from that area
of the mattress.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.320
DUCKY:
I also provided Abby
with epidermal scrapings

10:20.353 --> 10:21.254
from the victim's

10:21.288 --> 10:22.956
upper left torso.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.825
And the spectrometer found
minute traces

10:24.858 --> 10:26.193
of antimony sulfide

10:26.226 --> 10:28.195
and potassium chlorate on both.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.663
Matches.

10:29.697 --> 10:30.698
Light my fire, McGee.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.033
Someone struck a match
and ignited the oxygen.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.836
Well, according to the corpsman,
the commander was asleep.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.304
This was no accident,
Gibbs.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.339
Barbeque Boy... he was murdered.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.751
GIBBS:
Get back to Bethesda.
Review their security tapes.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.220
Find out how someone got
into that hospital room

10:53.253 --> 10:56.089
and then managed to get
out without being seen.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.090
On it, boss.

10:57.124 --> 10:57.858
Start a timeline.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.993
24 hours before
the explosion.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.095
I want to know every doctor,
nurse,

11:02.129 --> 11:04.765
orderly, visitor that went
into that hospital room.

11:04.798 --> 11:05.766
Okay.

11:05.799 --> 11:06.934
You two are
going to Norfolk.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.737
Dornan spent the last nine
months on the Kennedy.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.906
I'll get the car.

11:12.940 --> 11:13.606
What are you so jazzed about?

11:13.640 --> 11:15.142
He knows that
the first person

11:15.175 --> 11:16.209
you'll be talking to

11:16.243 --> 11:18.879
is the NCIS Agent Afloat.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.048
Special Agent Paula Cassidy.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.015
( chuckles )

11:22.049 --> 11:23.717
You're kidding.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.452
She was reassigned there.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.120
What am I missing?

11:27.154 --> 11:28.889
Paula Cassidy is a rather

11:28.922 --> 11:31.925
attractive agent that
DiNozzo drooled all
over last year

11:31.959 --> 11:33.293
when we were at Gitmo.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.128
Enough talk, Agent Todd.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.030
Let's go.

11:41.134 --> 11:45.806
Okay, Zero-two-32-eight-Q
would be this way.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.107
Last time we were
on a carrier,

11:47.140 --> 11:48.976
you were the one
who got lost. Not me.

11:49.009 --> 11:49.977
I wasn't lost.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.511
I was momentarily disoriented.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.080
Like you were
with Paula in Gitmo?

11:53.113 --> 11:55.148
I'm not the type to
kiss-and-tell, Kate.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.984
It's not like you
to be discreet, Tony.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.819
She's something special,
isn't she?

11:58.852 --> 12:00.220
Is he something special?
Who?

12:00.253 --> 12:02.089
Mr. Short Night Harrison.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.024
Six is two down this way.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.027
No. It's this way.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.395
Trust me. I'm right.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.207
We have to check in
with the XO.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.308
Why don't you
take care of that?

12:21.341 --> 12:22.342
Why don't you?

12:22.375 --> 12:23.510
Because I outrank you.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.545
That'll be six up
and three to the left.

12:25.578 --> 12:29.049
She is something special.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.157
( clears throat )

12:39.159 --> 12:40.260
CASSIDY:
Enter.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.503
I was expecting Gibbs.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.139
( wry laugh )

12:52.172 --> 12:53.173
Disappointed?

12:55.142 --> 12:58.211
Hi. You've been back a week.
Youdidn't call.

12:58.245 --> 13:01.314
Oh... I've been gone months.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.116
I didn't get any e-mails.

13:03.150 --> 13:06.119
Well, I figured you'd be
too busy to reply.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.288
You were at sea
with 5,000 men.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.190
I had trouble choosing.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.291
Guess I'm a hard act to follow.

13:11.324 --> 13:15.295
Actually, I was afraid
of making the same mistake.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.596
( chuckles )

13:16.629 --> 13:18.999
Ooh, wow. Full contact. There.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.467
Nice. Let's start over.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.270
I'll go back outside
and do this again.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.172
It won't change anything.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.311
Commander Dornan

13:31.344 --> 13:33.246
really blew up?

13:33.280 --> 13:36.249
Literally.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.185
There was no accident?

13:38.218 --> 13:40.353
Doesn't look that way.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.923
Was he having trouble with
anyone aboard the ship?

13:42.956 --> 13:47.961
Safety officers
are generally disliked.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.196
They have the authority
to stick their nose

13:49.229 --> 13:50.964
in anyone's department;
no one can say a word.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.133
That sounds like Gibbs.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.468
So Commander Dornan
made enemies.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.304
Made an art of it.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.873
Definitely sounds
like Gibbs.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.274
So I've just been
pulling files

14:01.308 --> 14:03.143
of all the people
he put re...

14:04.144 --> 14:05.913
...put on report.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.314
Could be the record
for a cruise.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.953
( sighs )

14:12.986 --> 14:16.156
How the hell did pure oxygen
accumulate in the chest cavity?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.390
I do not know, Jethro.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.226
I mean, lungs,
I can understand.

14:19.259 --> 14:22.395
The commander was receiving
oxygen through a nasal canula.

14:22.429 --> 14:27.567
But the fire originated outside
the lungs in the cavity.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.637
Dr. Byers!

14:30.670 --> 14:32.005
You're early.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.240
BYERS:
No traffic.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.608
Copies of Commander Dornan's
medical records.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.177
Ah! Thank you.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.447
We were finished,
weren't we, Jethro?

14:43.516 --> 14:47.087
We were, Ducky.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.288
Ducky?

14:48.321 --> 14:51.391
Yes. It's something I was tagged
with in school in my youth.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.927
I used to resent it.
Now I quite like it.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.495
So do I.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.370
Well, have you finish
the autopsy?

15:03.403 --> 15:06.339
Yes. Oh, oh, yes, there was

15:06.373 --> 15:08.575
one question
I wanted to ask you.

15:08.608 --> 15:12.212
Why did you choose
to perform a valve repair

15:12.245 --> 15:15.148
as opposed to valve replacement?

15:15.182 --> 15:17.584
It was a close call, but
Commander Dornan was insistent.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.618
If we replaced the valve,

15:18.651 --> 15:21.388
he wouldn't be able to
go back on active duty.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.089
Ah, yeah. True.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.124
But the team felt that the valve

15:24.157 --> 15:25.592
was repairable, and it was.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.395
( sighs )

15:28.428 --> 15:30.263
Ironic, though, isn't it?

15:30.297 --> 15:34.267
We saved his life only to have
him die in a freak accident.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.404
I'm afraid it wasn't
an accident.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.573
McGEE:
I reviewed the hospital's

15:40.607 --> 15:42.309
surveillance tapes
with security.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.643
Between the end
of visiting hours

15:43.676 --> 15:46.246
and the fire, all but five
people can be identified

15:46.279 --> 15:47.414
as hospital personnel.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.448
I downloaded them
onto my laptop.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.484
You eliminating the
hospital personnel, McGee?

15:51.518 --> 15:54.354
No, boss.
No. Definitely not.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.389
I'm gonna check
them all out.
In the meantime,

15:56.423 --> 15:58.425
I'm going to run
the five images

15:58.458 --> 16:00.060
through the face-recognition
system.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.294
Just give me one second

16:01.328 --> 16:03.396
and I will have them up
on the plasma.

16:06.033 --> 16:06.633
Agent Cassidy.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.535
Special Agent Gibbs.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.503
Agent Cassidy pulled files
on everyone

16:10.537 --> 16:12.405
Commander Dornan put on report.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.374
Not a people-friendly guy.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.210
GIBBS:
Yeah, we'll have to get into
all that. You ready?

16:17.244 --> 16:18.578
Yeah. My first pass

16:18.611 --> 16:20.347
at facial
recognition will be

16:20.380 --> 16:22.749
against a database
of military personnel

16:22.782 --> 16:24.351
and government employees.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.386
I can save you the trouble.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.587
That's Ensign Evan Hayes.

16:27.620 --> 16:31.124
He's in the Engineering
Department on the Kennedy.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.592
Commander Dornan rode his ass.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.062
More than the other
young officers?
Yeah.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.129
He did not like him,

16:36.163 --> 16:37.397
and I'm not sure why,

16:37.430 --> 16:40.600
but it got so bad that Ensign
Hayes verbally threatened him.

16:42.169 --> 16:45.205
DiNozzo, give me the
Report of Investigation.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.439
There isn't one.

16:46.473 --> 16:49.442
Commander Dornan asked
that I not write one up.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.611
That he would handle
it himself.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.518
NCIS special agents
do not look the other way

16:58.551 --> 17:00.687
because they're asked
to, Agent Cassidy.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.355
That wasn't what happened.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.590
Yeah? What happened then?

17:03.623 --> 17:06.693
I felt sorry for the kid.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.461
He didn't deserve the abuse.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.298
Some people can handle it
and he couldn't.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.465
And I didn't
think it should

17:12.499 --> 17:14.167
show up on his record.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.071
Get Ensign Hayes in here,

17:18.105 --> 17:19.806
Agent Cassidy.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.508
DiNozzo, you go with
her to make sure.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.717
Is that Dornan's surgeon
with Ducky?

17:30.750 --> 17:32.485
GIBBS:
Ducky's older, Kate.

17:32.519 --> 17:33.386
He's not dead.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.525
CHIEF:
Ensign Hayes went U-A,

17:38.558 --> 17:39.326
Agent Cassidy.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.427
Isn't most of the
ship on leave?

17:40.460 --> 17:41.628
Not Ensign Hayes.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.464
Commander Dornan put
him on Rivet Watch.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.300
He was restricted to the ship.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.402
Two days ago, he walked off.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.171
This is his quarters.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.507
We've put out calls.
Can't find him.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.309
Thank you,
Chief Velat.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.511
We're going to take
a little look around.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.121
Scuttlebutt's Commander Dornan
was murdered...

18:09.256 --> 18:10.823
...and Ensign Hayes did it.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.326
You've been in the Navy
long enough to know

18:13.360 --> 18:15.595
not to listen to scuttlebutt.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.630
Yes, ma'am.

18:17.664 --> 18:18.631
But I wouldn't blame him.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.234
Dornan rode him
from the minute he came aboard.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.704
Why do I get the feeling
you know why, Chief?

18:24.737 --> 18:26.473
Captain Dornan and I both served

18:26.506 --> 18:28.775
under Ensign Hayes' father,
Captain Hayes.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.378
Dornan was a lieutenant then,
who needed to be

18:31.411 --> 18:33.246
put in his place,

18:33.280 --> 18:37.217
and, boy, did the old man do it.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.652
This cruise was payback time.

18:42.289 --> 18:45.525
TONY:
I got to go topside and
make a phone call. Thank you.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.798
ABBY:
The EKG and the IVAC
recycle at timed intervals.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.700
I was able to salvage
the last seven minutes

18:53.733 --> 18:54.901
of Dornan's vitals.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.436
I thought you
could use them.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.570
Thank you.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.374
Are you making a statement
with this tie, Ducky?

19:01.408 --> 19:02.575
Oh, too much, you think?

19:02.609 --> 19:03.576
Oh, no, no, no.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.812
You can pull it off.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.581
So, what's the big event?

19:08.615 --> 19:09.616
Dinner date?

19:09.649 --> 19:11.318
Oh, too... ordinary.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.452
What then?

19:12.485 --> 19:17.424
I thought I'd show her something
that reveals who I am.

19:17.457 --> 19:21.661
If she gets turned on, too,
we haven't wasted our time.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.597
You're the man, Ducky.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.266
Mm.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.435
Why can't I find
someone like you?

19:28.468 --> 19:31.604
Well, if this doesn't
work out, I am available.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.673
( chuckles )

19:57.397 --> 19:58.798
I'll be right back.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.306
Evan!

20:06.339 --> 20:07.807
What're you still
doing here?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.576
You promised me you'd
go back to your ship.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.644
I can't, Coach.

20:11.678 --> 20:14.281
Now, come on-- a two-day
absence can't be that serious.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.715
It's more than that.

20:16.749 --> 20:17.884
What?

20:17.917 --> 20:18.751
Did you call
your father?

20:18.785 --> 20:19.752
No.

20:19.786 --> 20:20.820
He could help you.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.923
Commander Dornan put me
through hell because of him.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.626
You can't blame everything
on your father.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.362
You've got to take
responsibility for
yourself.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.464
You're throwing away
your career.

20:31.498 --> 20:34.467
I... I never wanted to be
in the Navy.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.568
But you are.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.440
Promise me you'll go back
to your ship, all right?

20:40.473 --> 20:43.009
Set things straight.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.744
BOY:
Hey, Coach!

20:44.777 --> 20:45.745
We're ready.

20:45.778 --> 20:46.813
All right, all right.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.415
I'll be right there.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.684
Hey, you're going back.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.390
Hey, Coach.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.728
Thanks.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.930
Keep me posted, huh?

21:22.048 --> 21:24.083
Ensign Hayes was recorded

21:24.116 --> 21:24.951
on the hospital security tape

21:24.984 --> 21:26.419
at 0203.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.421
The explosion that killed
Commander Dornan

21:28.455 --> 21:30.022
wasn't until 0317.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.491
Where was he in
between those times?

21:31.524 --> 21:32.425
Find him and you can ask him.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.627
Any hits on his cell phone
or credit cards?

21:34.661 --> 21:35.628
Nothing.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.764
Kate.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.367
Dornan punished Hayes
with port watch.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.868
He was one of the few
left on board.

21:41.901 --> 21:42.902
Most of the others
have scattered.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.772
They were away for nine months.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.607
The few I could track down
haven't heard from him.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.742
Ensign Hayes was
your typical Navy brat.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.778
His family moved around a lot
when he was young.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.079
Went to high school
in Alexandria

21:53.112 --> 21:55.382
when his father was
assigned to the Pentagon.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.849
Talk to the parents?
The mother.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.552
When Captain Hayes retired,
they moved to Scottsdale.

21:59.586 --> 22:00.853
She seemed a little concerned

22:00.887 --> 22:02.722
because she hasn't
heard from her son

22:02.755 --> 22:04.391
since the Kennedy made port.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.393
E-mail his photo
to the locals.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.094
It's done, boss.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.762
DC, Virginia,
Delaware and Maryland.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.734
You need anything from
your sleeping quarters?

22:14.767 --> 22:17.737
What you're thinking...
that's against regs.

22:17.770 --> 22:18.938
Great. You can handcuff me.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.072
( scoffs )

22:20.106 --> 22:21.974
It's not going
to happen, DiNozzo.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.611
Why not?

22:24.644 --> 22:26.446
We're both game players.

22:26.479 --> 22:27.780
Too much alike, huh?

22:27.814 --> 22:30.450
We would drive
each other crazy.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.718
Crazy's good.

22:31.751 --> 22:32.919
Yeah.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.960
Hey. What you working on?

22:40.993 --> 22:41.961
Stomach contents.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.930
Gastric juices

22:43.963 --> 22:44.964
and glandular secretions.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.801
This is whacked.

22:48.835 --> 22:51.604
What... is whacked?

22:51.638 --> 22:52.505
Something's is missing

22:52.539 --> 22:53.740
that should be here.

23:03.550 --> 23:07.053
I going to have to lock you up
for the night, Commander.

23:12.492 --> 23:15.528
( deep voice ):
No! Don't put me
back in the dark!

23:15.562 --> 23:17.797
Abby, you made me almost...

23:17.830 --> 23:19.031
Made you almost what?

23:19.065 --> 23:20.166
( growling ):
Jimmy...

23:20.199 --> 23:21.668
You know what!

23:21.701 --> 23:22.969
Where's Ducky?

23:23.002 --> 23:24.471
He left early.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.806
Can you get him
on his cell?

23:28.641 --> 23:29.709
Something wrong?

23:29.742 --> 23:32.745
( ringing )

23:32.779 --> 23:34.681
I guess he doesn't
want to be disturbed.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.064
When you asked me out,

23:52.098 --> 23:53.500
I didn't expect
to be touring

23:53.533 --> 23:55.134
the basement
of the Smithsonian.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.804
This is where
they prepare the exhibits.

23:57.837 --> 24:00.507
Can't you just feel
the history, Janice?

24:00.540 --> 24:01.741
Where do we start?

24:01.774 --> 24:03.810
This is
my favorite.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.878
These were used
by army surgeons

24:05.912 --> 24:08.080
Joseph Woodward
and Edward Curtis

24:08.114 --> 24:09.582
at the postmortem

24:09.616 --> 24:11.618
of Abraham Lincoln,
performed

24:11.651 --> 24:12.752
in a guest bedroom
at the White House.

24:12.785 --> 24:16.589
The Lincoln Bedroom, hence
the popular misconception.

24:16.623 --> 24:17.924
Lincoln never slept there.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.759
How do you have
access to this?

24:19.792 --> 24:20.993
Oh, I consulted

24:21.027 --> 24:22.795
on Lincoln's autopsy.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.997
( chuckles )

24:25.031 --> 24:26.098
That is the ball

24:26.132 --> 24:28.267
fired by Booth
that killed Lincoln.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.536
These bits of bone

24:29.569 --> 24:30.970
are skull fragments.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.805
( sighs )

24:32.839 --> 24:35.842
You're are an
unusual man, Ducky.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.511
Would you care
for a bite to eat?

24:38.545 --> 24:39.846
We just got here.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.085
( soft gasp )

24:46.118 --> 24:47.219
Oh...

24:47.253 --> 24:48.254
Wow.

24:50.590 --> 24:54.293
How does a woman like you
end up in the Navy?

24:54.326 --> 24:58.197
My father's a retired
Chief Petty Officer.

24:58.230 --> 25:01.133
You ever contemplate
private practice?

25:01.167 --> 25:04.203
Actually, my obligation
to the Navy is up.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.573
I'm leaving next month
to accept an offer

25:06.606 --> 25:07.840
from Columbia Pres.

25:07.874 --> 25:08.908
New York.

25:08.941 --> 25:09.742
( chuckles )

25:09.776 --> 25:11.310
Now that is exciting.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.779
( cork pops )

25:19.786 --> 25:21.220
( Ducky chuckles )

25:24.056 --> 25:26.826
( phone rings )

25:26.859 --> 25:28.127
Thanks.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.830
NCIS, Special Agent
McGee speaking...

25:30.863 --> 25:32.699
Thanks.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.267
What?

25:35.301 --> 25:36.836
Why are you being so
tough on Agent Cassidy?

25:36.869 --> 25:38.705
I haven't done
anything to her yet.

25:38.738 --> 25:41.107
You made her spend the day,
alone, with DiNozzo.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.042
She survived. They're
on their way back.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.944
Wait, boss,
one second.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.113
Okay. Got it.
Thank you, ma'am.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.949
Ensign Hayes just made a
charge on his credit card.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.217
A hotel on Braddock
Road, Alexandria.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.952
Contact DiNozzo
and Cassidy.

25:52.985 --> 25:53.953
Have them meet us there.

25:53.986 --> 25:54.954
You man the phones.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.222
Kate, come on. Let's go.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.995
Gibbs, NCIS.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.096
May I see that, please?

26:09.101 --> 26:10.837
Okay. What can I do
for you, Agent Gibbs?

26:10.870 --> 26:13.973
You just checked in an
Evan Hayes. What room's he in?

26:14.006 --> 26:15.908
It would be illegal
to release that information.

26:18.978 --> 26:19.712
We're investigating
a crime

26:19.746 --> 26:21.113
and we need
to speak with him.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.815
Then I suggest
you get a warrant.

26:22.849 --> 26:25.251
Hayes is in
the United States Navy.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.820
As you just saw,
I'm a Special Agent

26:27.854 --> 26:29.822
with the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

26:29.856 --> 26:31.624
I don't need a civilian warrant.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.125
You are absolutely
correct there, sir.

26:33.159 --> 26:36.729
You need the military
equivalent, a DD-553.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.866
You a law student?

26:39.899 --> 26:41.333
Second year
at Georgetown.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.870
Gonna give you a lesson
tonight in practical law.

26:43.903 --> 26:48.908
I'm going to ask for
Hayes's room key, politely,

26:48.941 --> 26:50.910
and you're going
to hand it over.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.879
Key? Hotels haven't
used keys in years.

26:52.912 --> 26:56.916
If he has to wake up a judge,
nobody is going to be happy.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.023
Okay. But announce
yourself first.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.792
That's in compliance

27:05.825 --> 27:07.393
with the recent
Supreme Court decision.

27:10.730 --> 27:11.731
All right, Tony,
you're with me.

27:11.764 --> 27:12.899
Kate, seal off
the hallway.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.066
Paul, you got
the service elevator.

27:19.972 --> 27:20.673
We announce,

27:20.707 --> 27:22.041
and then we go in.

27:23.142 --> 27:23.876
Okay.

27:23.910 --> 27:28.247
( rock music playing )

27:28.280 --> 27:31.784
NCIS! Get your hands up!
Get your hands in the air.

27:31.818 --> 27:32.985
Up, up, up!

27:33.019 --> 27:34.721
Get 'em up!

27:34.754 --> 27:35.187
Party's over.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.288
Get up!

27:40.026 --> 27:40.927
Where's Ensign Hayes?

27:44.163 --> 27:45.832
Put your hands down.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.800
One of you checked in

27:47.834 --> 27:49.301
as Evan Hayes.

27:50.803 --> 27:53.906
DiNozzo, search them
and find the credit card.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.007
Let's see some I.D.

27:55.041 --> 27:58.010
Just give it to him,
Jonathon!

28:01.413 --> 28:04.350
Thank you, Jonathon.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.757
Where'd you get this?

28:10.790 --> 28:14.093
A guy gave it to me.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.427
Gonna have to do better
than that, Jonathon.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.296
Look, I swear
it's the truth.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.965
Okay, we were hanging out
after swim practice

28:18.998 --> 28:21.267
and this strange guy
just walked in.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.201
Really spaced.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.003
He... he just handed me
the card and said

28:24.036 --> 28:25.872
that we should have
a good time with it.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.940
That he didn't
need it anymore.

28:27.974 --> 28:30.109
It's true, mister. He was
trying to get rid of us.

28:30.142 --> 28:32.178
He said he wanted
to use the pool.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.246
And you didn't think
that was a little weird?

28:34.280 --> 28:36.482
Well, yeah, but, I mean,
he said could party

28:36.515 --> 28:37.917
with his credit card.

28:37.950 --> 28:38.851
Where's the pool?

28:38.885 --> 28:41.888
Alexandria Central High.

28:43.155 --> 28:45.758
Agent Cassidy!

28:45.792 --> 28:48.060
You and DiNozzo baby-sit
these people

28:48.094 --> 28:49.061
until their
parents get here.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.063
And collect their car keys.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.332
Aw... Come on, man.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.105
Nobody likes
a whiner, Jonathon.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.107
Nice shirt.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.976
See? I knew we'd end up

29:04.010 --> 29:06.045
in a hotel room tonight.

29:31.370 --> 29:34.040
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

29:34.073 --> 29:37.109
Get down on your stomach.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.946
Spread your arms
and legs. Quickly.

29:39.979 --> 29:41.580
I'm done taking orders.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.482
Do it now, Ensign Hayes!

29:46.118 --> 29:48.054
No, son. You don't
want to do that.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.421
Then put the weapon down.

29:49.455 --> 29:50.957
Can't.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.124
I've got to cover my partner.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.225
Isn't that right, Kate?

29:53.259 --> 29:54.793
KATE:
Right.

29:56.362 --> 29:58.230
A woman?

29:58.264 --> 30:02.034
I would never hurt a woman.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.573
Okay.

30:11.010 --> 30:14.213
I'm holstering
my weapon, okay?

30:20.219 --> 30:21.387
All right,

30:21.420 --> 30:22.521
your turn.

30:36.035 --> 30:39.238
I've been trying to pull
this trigger all night...

30:39.271 --> 30:41.073
but I can't...

30:41.107 --> 30:43.075
'cause I'm a coward.

30:43.109 --> 30:46.245
You're not a coward.

30:46.278 --> 30:49.581
You just don't
want to die.

30:49.615 --> 30:54.153
I can't spend the rest
of my life taking his orders.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.088
Commander Dornan pushed
a lot of people's buttons.

30:56.122 --> 30:57.156
Not just yours.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.093
Commander Dornan...

31:01.127 --> 31:04.263
he's... he's not
my problem anymore.

31:09.168 --> 31:12.171
This is the only place
I ever felt safe.

31:12.204 --> 31:16.442
It's the only place
I was ever happy.

31:16.475 --> 31:19.078
All right.
Let's talk about it.

31:21.113 --> 31:23.349
It's too late to talk.

31:27.419 --> 31:28.520
Don't do it.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.940
That's Evan.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.544
He was troubled...

31:54.380 --> 31:56.648
...but I had no idea
he was suicidal.

31:59.351 --> 32:00.987
He was suspected of murder.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.621
Murder?

32:02.654 --> 32:05.257
Evan? No way.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.725
We think he killed
a superior officer

32:06.758 --> 32:08.327
at the Bethesda Naval Hospital

32:08.360 --> 32:09.361
Tuesday.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.162
Tuesday?

32:10.196 --> 32:11.397
When?

32:11.430 --> 32:13.165
A little after 0300.

32:13.199 --> 32:14.166
3:00 a.m.?

32:14.200 --> 32:16.202
That's impossible.
He was with me.

32:17.136 --> 32:20.339
He called.
He woke me and my wife up.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.208
He wasn't making any sense.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.676
I told him
I'd come get him.

32:24.710 --> 32:27.346
I picked him up in front
of the hospital around 2:00.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.182
You must have
the wrong time.

32:30.216 --> 32:31.183
No, I'm certain.

32:31.217 --> 32:32.384
Well, it's not possible
because...

32:32.418 --> 32:33.385
Agent Todd,

32:33.419 --> 32:34.586
I'll meet you up
in the squad room.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.255
No, Gibbs,
that would mean...

32:51.437 --> 32:53.405
How long were you with him?

32:53.439 --> 32:57.043
We sat up talking all night.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.311
About what?

32:59.345 --> 33:00.579
Mostly his father.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.481
They had a lot
of problems.

33:02.514 --> 33:05.517
Ensign Hayes tell you why
he was at the hospital?

33:05.551 --> 33:07.419
Said he wanted
to confront someone

33:07.453 --> 33:08.787
who was giving him
a hard time,

33:08.820 --> 33:11.757
but he lost his nerve.

33:22.568 --> 33:26.238
Ensign Hayes has an alibi?

33:26.272 --> 33:27.106
What's going to happen?

33:27.139 --> 33:29.408
Nothing. You did
everything by the book.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.077
I killed an innocent man, Gibbs.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.145
It was suicide-by-cop, Kate.

33:33.179 --> 33:35.181
Get over it.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.183
We focused
on the wrong guy.

33:38.284 --> 33:40.186
No one went in or out

33:40.219 --> 33:41.587
of Commander Dornan's room
between the time

33:41.620 --> 33:43.255
the corpsman checked up on him
and the explosion.

33:43.289 --> 33:44.223
GIBBS:
What about
the corpsman?

33:44.256 --> 33:45.524
I checked his record
against the commander's.

33:45.557 --> 33:46.458
Their paths never crossed

33:46.492 --> 33:48.227
until the commander came in
for surgery.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.428
There were four others
on the security video

33:49.461 --> 33:50.596
you couldn't identify.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.698
Right. I've cleared
three of them.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.100
One is still unknown.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.767
And I'm on it.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.270
Go back to the ship.

33:58.304 --> 33:59.638
Go over your files again.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.481
Agent Gibbs,

34:09.515 --> 34:10.382
I need to explain...

34:10.416 --> 34:12.351
There's nothing to
explain, Agent Cassidy.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.320
You didn't file a report.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.188
Now two naval officers
are dead.

34:16.222 --> 34:19.091
Would it have mattered?
We'll never know.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.329
DiNozzo, go down
to the lab.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.164
Go over all
the physical evidence

34:25.197 --> 34:26.598
from the hospital
room again.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.269
Uh, what am I looking for?

34:31.370 --> 34:33.472
I'll figure it out.

34:39.278 --> 34:42.381
Good morning, Mr. Palmer.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.283
Oh. Is that the Ensign
Agent Todd shot?

34:44.316 --> 34:47.119
Yes, sir.

34:47.153 --> 34:48.120
Oh, dear.

34:48.154 --> 34:50.122
Oh, Abby wanted
you to see this

34:50.156 --> 34:51.623
as soon as you got in.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.625
Mm.

34:54.293 --> 34:55.394
Mr. Palmer,

34:55.427 --> 34:57.796
I want Commander Dornan's
remains back on the table.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.434
Kate, how are you?

35:02.468 --> 35:04.203
Well, I shot an innocent man,

35:04.236 --> 35:05.904
That give you any ideas?

35:05.937 --> 35:08.574
I'm sorry.
I need a service record.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.310
( Tony humming )

35:14.480 --> 35:16.648
( loud beeping )

35:16.682 --> 35:17.816
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

35:19.951 --> 35:22.554
Stop playing
with my equipment.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.756
Well, I haven't had
a woman say

35:24.790 --> 35:26.658
that to me
in a long time.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.595
Sorry.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.830
You break anything,
you're dead meat.

35:31.863 --> 35:33.532
What you working on?

35:33.565 --> 35:34.866
Evidence analysis report,
DiNozzo.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.335
Ooh.

35:36.368 --> 35:37.836
I think you misspelled...

35:37.869 --> 35:40.272
tetrafluoroethylene.

35:43.509 --> 35:46.645
I'm a great speller.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.580
Don't you have
somewhere else to be?

35:48.614 --> 35:50.882
Gibbs told me to go through
physical evidence.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.652
Oh, he expects you
to find something
that I didn't?

35:53.685 --> 35:55.287
Just another set of eyes,
Abbs.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.759
I really need
to finish this.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.194
Sorry.

36:03.729 --> 36:04.863
Dornan's personal effects?

36:05.731 --> 36:07.866
Yeah.

36:11.303 --> 36:12.103
Ooh.

36:12.137 --> 36:17.309
He didn't only have
heart problems,

36:17.343 --> 36:19.478
this guy was blind.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.651
Did you find any trace
of cigarette ash?

36:25.684 --> 36:28.220
In an oxygen fire?

36:28.254 --> 36:29.488
I don't think so.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.690
Wait.

36:33.359 --> 36:34.426
I did find something

36:34.460 --> 36:36.362
that might be
a cigarette filter...

36:36.395 --> 36:39.631
( chuckling ):
Abby...

36:39.665 --> 36:41.833
I think I know how
the oxygen was ignited.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.273
Here's the service record
you asked for, Ducky.

36:47.573 --> 36:54.313
Thanks.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.681
Thanks, Kate.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.562
Abby,

37:10.596 --> 37:11.730
what do you got
for me?

37:11.763 --> 37:13.865
Not me.
Cecil B. DiNozzo.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.767
Stalag 17.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.770
GI uses a cigarette
as a time fuse

37:18.804 --> 37:20.739
to blow up a Nazi train.

37:20.772 --> 37:21.907
Come on, guys.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.613
Don't try this at home, McGee.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.348
It's for grownups.

37:34.786 --> 37:35.721
( coughs )

37:35.754 --> 37:38.624
DiNozzo...

37:38.657 --> 37:40.392
( coughs )

37:40.426 --> 37:41.793
How do people do this?

37:41.827 --> 37:45.797
Okay, cigarette becomes
a time fuse.

37:45.831 --> 37:47.899
Check this.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.607
Huh?

37:55.641 --> 37:56.708
In real time,

37:56.742 --> 37:58.844
it takes about 12 minutes
for it to reach the matches.

37:58.877 --> 37:59.845
ABBY:
Cool, huh?

37:59.878 --> 38:01.880
The killer placed it next
to Dornan's side,

38:01.913 --> 38:03.615
under the tented sheet,

38:03.649 --> 38:05.884
next to the open oxygen line.

38:05.917 --> 38:06.985
Then he left the room.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.854
Who was there 12 minutes
before the fire?

38:08.887 --> 38:09.655
Dr. Byers.

38:09.688 --> 38:12.023
She was the one
who murdered him?

38:12.057 --> 38:13.058
DUCKY:
He wasn't murdered.

38:13.091 --> 38:16.928
Commander Dornan died
as a result of his surgery.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.931
Only Dr. Byers made it look
as if he was murdered.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.600
Who was she trying
to frame?

38:21.633 --> 38:24.770
No one.
She was covering her mistake.

38:24.803 --> 38:28.540
In 1995, she was the subject
of a malpractice investigation

38:28.574 --> 38:29.908
on a heart valve repair,

38:29.941 --> 38:31.777
almost identical
to the one

38:31.810 --> 38:33.779
she performed on the commander.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.981
So how do you know
that he was dead

38:36.014 --> 38:37.916
before the fire started?

38:37.949 --> 38:39.651
I compared
Dornan's previous EKG's

38:39.685 --> 38:42.821
to the last IVAC recording.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.556
That heartbeat wasn't his.

38:44.590 --> 38:46.425
She still could have
murdered him.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.893
Well, not intentionally.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.897
Duck...

38:52.998 --> 38:55.734
You trust my gut on this one.

38:57.636 --> 38:58.637
Everything is fine.

38:58.670 --> 38:59.938
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.512
Ducky, what a pleasant surprise.

39:09.147 --> 39:10.882
Special Agent Gibbs.

39:14.853 --> 39:19.357
DUCKY:
Janice, there was no Percocet
in Commander Dornan's stomach.

39:20.792 --> 39:24.630
I'm glad it's over.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.602
BYERS:
Dornan was in pain
and demanding to see me.

39:30.636 --> 39:34.540
I rushed to the hospital,
did an echocardiogram,

39:34.573 --> 39:38.744
and realized not replacing
the valve was a mistake.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.011
It was failing.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.947
Why didn't you operate
immediately?

39:41.980 --> 39:44.950
When I told him,
he became hysterical.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.117
He went into cardiac arrest.

39:46.151 --> 39:47.786
I tried to resuscitate him...

39:47.819 --> 39:50.489
but couldn't.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.691
A second failed
valve repair

39:52.724 --> 39:55.461
would end my career
and the job at Columbia Pres.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.496
I panicked.

39:57.529 --> 40:00.832
I tried to cover up.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.568
( sighs )

40:02.601 --> 40:03.569
( steady tone on EKG )

40:03.602 --> 40:05.136
I placed the EKG sensors

40:05.170 --> 40:06.304
on my own chest.

40:06.337 --> 40:11.009
I turned off the audible alarm,
cleared the record data

40:11.042 --> 40:14.480
and reset the time/date stamp
ahead 15 minutes,

40:14.513 --> 40:18.049
disconnected the oxygen tube
from his nasal canula

40:18.083 --> 40:20.719
and inserted it
into his incision

40:20.752 --> 40:24.022
so the oxygen could accumulate
in his chest cavity.

40:26.492 --> 40:31.463
Then using one of his own
cigarettes and a matchbook....

40:31.497 --> 40:33.832
I placed it on the bed.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.211
On my way out,

40:46.244 --> 40:49.915
I stopped by the nurses' station
and told them

40:49.948 --> 40:52.050
that I had sedated him
and he was resting

40:52.083 --> 40:54.986
and to check on him
in a half hour.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.021
Janice...

40:57.022 --> 40:59.057
...you didn't kill him.

41:02.961 --> 41:06.632
But I did...

41:06.665 --> 41:09.601
by not replacing the valve
in the first place.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.938
( phone rings )

41:12.971 --> 41:14.940
This is Paula.
Leave a message.

41:16.775 --> 41:19.811
Hey, it's me.

41:19.845 --> 41:20.746
Come on, just cause
you're pissed at Gibbs

41:20.779 --> 41:24.683
is no reason not
to return my calls, right?

41:24.716 --> 41:27.686
So dial the number,
'cause you've got it. Okay.

41:28.754 --> 41:29.855
Sometimes,
you've just got

41:29.888 --> 41:31.723
to know when
to let go, Tony.

41:31.757 --> 41:32.724
You don't really expect me

41:32.758 --> 41:35.093
to take advice about women
from you, do you?

41:35.126 --> 41:37.596
I could stay here
and argue the point,

41:37.629 --> 41:39.765
but I have a date.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.769
So now what?

41:43.802 --> 41:45.203
I don't know.

41:45.236 --> 41:46.271
You can't let any woman

41:46.304 --> 41:47.839
affect you like this, Duck.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.941
Especially one
you didn't know that well.

41:49.975 --> 41:51.777
My concerns are
more immediate.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.745
I have two tickets
for the opera tonight.

41:53.779 --> 41:54.846
She was going
to accompany me.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.114
Jethro?

41:56.147 --> 41:57.716
No.

41:57.749 --> 41:59.818
I wonder if Kate
would be interested.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.653
Do you know where she is?

42:01.687 --> 42:04.289
No.
