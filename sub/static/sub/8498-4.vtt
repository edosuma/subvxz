<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:33.360 --> 00:37.239
<i>The world was shifting
on its axis in 1961,</i>

00:37.600 --> 00:40.353
<i>strides were being made,
decisions taken,</i>

00:40.560 --> 00:45.475
<i>questions asked. It was as true
at Nonnatus House as it was anywhere.</i>

00:48.520 --> 00:50.795
<i>The world was turning faster,</i>

00:50.880 --> 00:53.553
<i>burning brighter. It was all we could do</i>

00:53.640 --> 00:57.838
<i>to keep pace, keep time,
keep abreast of so much change.</i>

01:07.560 --> 01:08.629
Sister,

01:09.080 --> 01:10.936
- whatever are you doing?
- I'm cleaning the portrait

01:10.960 --> 01:12.712
of Sister Hildegard with some bread.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.199
Her anniversary is coming up,

01:14.440 --> 01:16.954
and I once read in a magazine
that this is the best way

01:17.040 --> 01:18.439
to freshen up an oil painting.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.154
She was the first of our sisters
to come to Poplar.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.798
It's so important that we remember her.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.874
I missed her commemoration service
last year,

01:26.960 --> 01:30.270
so this is the first I've been to
since I joined the order.

01:31.480 --> 01:32.913
It was very special.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.514
Bless you, Sister.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.548
- Nurse. Nurse!
- Oh! Good morning, Linda.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.456
You haven't been to Sadie's yet,
have you, Nurse?

01:49.480 --> 01:50.629
No, she's next on my list.

01:50.920 --> 01:53.639
Would you take her these?
It's just a few cough candy twists.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.176
I was gonna drop 'em in,
but I'm running late.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.235
Of course.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.837
Oh, and tell her I'll pop in
after my shift!

02:06.320 --> 02:07.912
Your lips are moving.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.110
They're always moving on the quiet.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.436
Poetry this time or one of your plays?

02:12.520 --> 02:15.080
"O for a Muse of fire,
that would ascend."

02:15.160 --> 02:16.957
"The brightest heaven of invention..."

02:17.040 --> 02:18.075
It's from Henry V.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.236
That the one with Sir Laurence Olivier?

02:20.320 --> 02:22.550
It's the one
by William Shakespeare, Mum.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.709
I fixed it.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.235
Now, don't keep taking it down
to look at all the time.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.308
Postman will be here soon.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.713
And he might walk past again.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.190
Like he did yesterday
and the day before.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.355
- Nurse calling.
- Come through, angel.

02:39.800 --> 02:40.994
Angel?

02:41.080 --> 02:42.354
I could get used to that.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.714
- Hello, Nurse.
- Hello.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.950
Still, I suppose
there is something rather celestial

02:46.040 --> 02:49.032
about a person who comes
bearing burns dressings

02:49.120 --> 02:51.759
and a quarter
of medicinal confectionary.

02:51.840 --> 02:52.909
From Linda?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.035
Yes.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.792
You've picked a lovely girl there, Ian.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.074
Oh, he never picked her.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.912
He hasn't got the common sense.

02:59.760 --> 03:00.954
They picked each other.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.832
First day down the mixed infants.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.749
Didn't you, son?

03:05.560 --> 03:07.949
That's right.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.473
I really don't like the sound
of that cough, Mrs Bulmer.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.795
- You've had it for three weeks now.
- It's just dust

03:16.320 --> 03:17.992
off my royal collection.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.556
I see he's fixed that picture of yours.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.869
I should hope so, too.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.309
Her Majesty and me.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.630
Her Majesty
and a bit of your head, you mean?

03:25.960 --> 03:27.234
She's a lovely lady.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.238
Her hat was exquisite.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.915
Petal-covered cloche
and navy silk organza.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.112
It's a shame she wasn't standing by you
where the hexane caught.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.231
Then I'd be dressing royal burns

03:38.320 --> 03:40.993
- and not just yours.
- Picture's my souvenir.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.550
Twenty-seven years
I've done at Heywoods, so far.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.553
My husband did 30.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.355
He got his long-service watch
before he died.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.475
Ian wears it now.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.911
I got in, Mum!
I've got a place at Durham!

03:53.080 --> 03:54.513
At university, to do English.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.397
Oh, Ian, congratulations.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.199
First in the street.

03:58.520 --> 03:59.669
Well done, son.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.120
It's all right if I bring the boys in?

04:17.160 --> 04:18.593
Of course.

04:18.680 --> 04:21.877
As long as they steer clear
of Wendy House corner.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.996
I don't want another incident
with the mangle.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.117
Oh, right. Go on! You heard.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.918
Take a seat, Mrs Cottingham.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.350
We're just talking through
the differences

04:32.440 --> 04:34.590
between home and hospital delivery.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.275
We'll try to give you
as much information as we can.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.679
I'm stopping at home.

04:39.760 --> 04:42.832
Turn my back on my lot for 10 days,
I'll have no house to come back to.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.576
My old man would have lost it
in a card game.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.670
Or the kids will have burnt it down.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.715
Isn't there any visiting
in the afternoons?

04:51.080 --> 04:53.310
My Kevin's on permanent nights.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.073
Rules are quite strict
on maternity wards.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.516
It helps get babies into a routine.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.512
Many new mothers
find this quite helpful,

05:00.600 --> 05:03.114
though baby would see rather more
of his or her father

05:03.200 --> 05:04.553
if you gave birth at home.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.194
I want the gas, though.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.436
Proper gas. Off a machine.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.480
Someone told me if you have it at home,

05:10.560 --> 05:12.936
they give you gas through the cooker,
and I think that's dangerous.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.872
That would be very dangerous, indeed.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.431
Gas in here is completely different

05:18.520 --> 05:20.590
and the midwives bring the apparatus
to your home.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.310
What if something goes wrong
with the delivery?

05:26.600 --> 05:27.828
Is it your first, love?

05:28.080 --> 05:29.149
Yeah.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.320
You'd be all right with the Nonnatuns,
wouldn't she?

05:32.080 --> 05:33.957
Dr Turner is never far away,

05:34.040 --> 05:35.314
and, in an emergency...

05:35.400 --> 05:37.096
you can get to the hospital
very quickly.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.189
Terrence!

05:38.640 --> 05:40.119
You leave that little girl alone.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.270
I do not want
any more fingers in mangles.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.200
Should've had them in the hospital
and left them there.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.429
Mr Hereward!

05:53.520 --> 05:55.556
Mr Hereward! I got into Durham.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.153
- Yes!
- Just like you!

05:57.240 --> 05:59.256
- Only in English Lit, not Theology.
- Which college?

05:59.280 --> 06:00.793
- Castle.
- I know it well.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.952
Take a vest and a hot water bottle.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.354
All right, young man.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.071
No leading my daughter astray, now.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.394
It's all right, Morris.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.440
I'll have her back in time
to get you your dinner.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.233
Thanks, Mr Hereward...

06:12.360 --> 06:14.560
For the books, and for the train fare
for the interview!

06:15.520 --> 06:16.839
For everything, really.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.632
Linda! Linda, guess what? I got in!

06:26.920 --> 06:29.275
Good. The baby's head-down.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.150
So, nicely poised,

06:32.240 --> 06:34.754
settled into your pelvis,
ready for delivery.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.875
You really are a model patient,
Mrs Cottingham.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.110
Well, let's hope then
I have a model baby.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.518
And preferably one I can dress in pink

06:42.600 --> 06:44.556
and don't have to yell at
till I'm hoarse.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.200
Would you like a little girl this time?

06:46.560 --> 06:50.075
Yeah. I know I'm meant to say
"I don't mind as long as it's healthy".

06:50.160 --> 06:51.639
And I do love my boys...

06:52.120 --> 06:53.838
But lads, Sister,

06:54.280 --> 06:55.998
they egg each other on.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.077
Have you considered a hospital delivery

06:58.640 --> 07:00.198
so that you could have some rest?

07:00.280 --> 07:03.670
Nah, I like my own bed,
and my own toilet.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.832
Help me down, Sister, duty calls.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.718
I wish I knew where you buy lassos.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.075
I could keep one in me handbag.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.310
Wait till you see the library
I'll be studying in.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.550
The cathedral, the river...

07:20.640 --> 07:21.959
I like this river.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.352
What was that poem
you used to say to me?

07:29.440 --> 07:32.477
The one about the lady and the mirror?

07:33.480 --> 07:36.040
"Willows whiten, aspens shiver."

07:36.360 --> 07:40.148
"The sunbeam-showers break and quiver
In the stream that runneth ever."

07:40.640 --> 07:42.915
"By the island in the river."

07:43.160 --> 07:44.878
"Flowing down to Camelot."

07:46.080 --> 07:47.433
That was my favourite.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.396
It isn't about the Thames, Linda.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.296
My life isn't going to be about
clocking into the paintworks,

07:53.320 --> 07:55.231
day in day out like my mum and dad's.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.320
I'm going to get us
both right out of here.

07:59.080 --> 08:01.640
When I get my degree,
we can go where we like.

08:02.520 --> 08:03.953
I don't know.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.349
Well, if you don't know, Lin, I do.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.075
I do.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.197
- It's funny.
- Why?

08:14.760 --> 08:16.318
You said it accidentally.

08:17.320 --> 08:20.437
And quite soon, I think
you're gonna be saying it for real.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.232
This morning I went to the doctor's.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.359
I'm in the family way.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.712
Ian! Ian!

08:34.320 --> 08:36.788
Look, you can run all you like,
but it won't go away!

08:40.240 --> 08:42.150
We love each other, don't we?

08:43.480 --> 08:45.232
You said you loved me, when we did it.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.634
And I meant it.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.755
I really did.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.876
No calls this afternoon, Sister.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.839
Could've come to clinic, after all.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.680
I don't like to leave
the telephone unmanned.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.796
This is usually
such a busy time of year.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.512
Nonnatus House, Midwife speaking.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.436
Yes, of course, she's here now.

09:10.520 --> 09:11.635
Sister?

09:11.720 --> 09:13.870
It's the matron
of St Cuthbert's Hospital.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.115
She asked to speak to you.

09:16.160 --> 09:19.994
I'm entirely happy to deputise
with regard to administration, Sister.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.391
But hospital routines
are rather gruelling.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.456
Are you sure you don't want to send
one of the youngsters?

09:25.480 --> 09:26.629
It's only for a week.

09:27.560 --> 09:31.792
But I'm sure St Cuthbert's will provide
a bath chair if I can't take the pace.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.914
I'll thank you for the beetroot,
Sister Winifred.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.668
Sister Julienne,
I really don't mind going.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.830
I've never been
seconded to St Cuthbert's.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.296
They've won prizes for their hygiene.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.517
I volunteered my services
for several reasons.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.990
First, their need is great.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.998
Second, my load here is lightest

09:51.080 --> 09:52.832
in terms of clinical work.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.911
And third, I haven't worked

09:55.000 --> 09:57.036
in a hospital for almost ten years.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.754
More and more women are choosing
hospital deliveries.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.989
I'm keen to see why.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.674
I think you'll find that whatever
the fold involves,

10:03.760 --> 10:06.035
babies come out in much the same way.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.552
And they have done since Adam and Eve
were in their birthday suits.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.918
Uh, Sister Mary Cynthia?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.719
Whilst I'm in hospital, would you be
kind enough to draw up a plan

10:14.800 --> 10:16.233
for Sister Hildegard's service?

10:16.600 --> 10:18.158
It would be an honour, Sister.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.033
But the child barely knows
the woman's name,

10:22.920 --> 10:25.150
let alone recount her virtues.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.952
Or recall her toil...

10:27.040 --> 10:28.632
I thought this would be a chance

10:28.720 --> 10:30.551
- for her to learn.
- It will.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.430
If Sister Monica Joan will help me.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.028
We shall toil together,

10:39.120 --> 10:41.076
like Ruth and Naomi,

10:41.160 --> 10:43.071
after the death of Elimelech.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.479
That'll be lovely.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.633
I can't believe <i>La Dolce Vita</i>
is finally here.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.136
I've been reading about it in magazines
for the past 12 months.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.628
And I've been promising
to sit through it with you.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.355
You want to see Anita Ekberg
in that fountain just as much as I do.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.711
I'm not on duty a week next Friday,

10:59.800 --> 11:02.951
and as far as I can ascertain
you're not on call.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.110
Have you been looking
at the advanced roster?

11:05.200 --> 11:06.997
Guilty as charged.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.275
- But is it a date?
- What are you two up to?

11:09.400 --> 11:10.719
Trying to get our legs brown.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.075
I'm not doing too badly,
but poor Patsy's struggling,

11:13.160 --> 11:14.798
what with being a redhead
and everything.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.440
I had shins like milk bottles,
even when I was a blonde.

11:18.680 --> 11:19.715
Oh...

11:19.920 --> 11:23.117
Just look at Anita Ekberg's bust
in that black dress.

11:23.240 --> 11:25.470
She must be wearing
the most stupendous brassiere,

11:25.560 --> 11:27.471
or how on earth has
she managed to go strapless?

11:27.640 --> 11:29.376
Well, if you come to the flicks with us
next Friday,

11:29.400 --> 11:30.879
you might find out.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.393
Oh, how perfectly marvellous.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.835
Should we treat ourselves
to the two and nines?

11:36.840 --> 11:40.276
I've just tried rubbing my legs
with Trex to speed things up.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.696
There's a great big block of it
in the fridge

11:41.720 --> 11:44.792
because Nurse Crane
won't eat anything fried and dripping.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.016
Do you fancy coming to the pictures
next week, Barbara?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.837
We're going up West to see
<i>La Dolce Vita.</i>

11:48.920 --> 11:51.673
If enough people join in,
we could book a charabanc.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.398
What day next week?

11:54.040 --> 11:55.075
Friday.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.070
I'd love to, if I'm not busy.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.558
Why would you be busy, Barbara?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.631
You normally have Friday evenings off.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.558
A relative from my mother's side

12:05.640 --> 12:09.428
is going to be in London, and I
promised her I'd show her the sights.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.271
How terribly public-spirited of you.

12:13.040 --> 12:16.396
No, not really,
I'm just very fond of Cousin Mabel.

12:16.960 --> 12:17.995
Of course you are.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.390
- Trixie?
- You'll have to excuse me.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.789
I'm going to make myself a face mask
out of salad cream.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.936
I believe one can find
the most amazing aids

12:25.960 --> 12:27.393
to beauty in the kitchen cupboards.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.879
Sister Knowles?

12:49.840 --> 12:52.638
- I'm Sister Julienne.
- Ah, Sister.

12:52.720 --> 12:53.789
Glad to have you.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.949
The wards are chockablock.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.239
Handing you over to another
midwife now, dear.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.519
Notes are on the trolley.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.749
Why go?

13:03.840 --> 13:06.513
- Why go?
- It's time for my break, Mrs Shahjee.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.831
I'll be able to look after you
much better if I look after myself.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.796
Unless the head is crowning or beyond,

13:13.880 --> 13:17.031
we find it best to stick
to our breaks as scheduled.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.356
This mother is only eight months

13:19.440 --> 13:21.635
but baby appears
to be a satisfactory size.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.074
Mrs Shahjee.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.479
Jamila?

13:29.800 --> 13:31.028
Jamila.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.471
I don't know how you could be so stupid.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.157
You went to grammar school!

13:37.560 --> 13:39.391
Your mother would turn in her grave.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.032
Do you think I haven't thought that?

13:42.880 --> 13:45.376
Do you think that wasn't the first thing
that came into my head?

13:45.400 --> 13:48.039
And the first thing that came into mine
was, "When's the wedding?"

13:54.320 --> 13:56.096
The tissue granulations
are coming along wonderfully.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.155
Well?

13:57.240 --> 13:59.754
- I'm supposed to be going to university.
- Men work,

13:59.920 --> 14:03.469
and they provide, and they stand by
girls when they get them into trouble.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.433
Don't they, Nurse?

14:06.840 --> 14:07.875
Uh...

14:08.040 --> 14:10.156
In the absence of my tin helmet,

14:10.240 --> 14:12.071
which does rather interfere
with my coiffure,

14:12.520 --> 14:13.800
I've been trying not to comment.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.680
But if there's one thing
I've been taught over the years,

14:16.720 --> 14:18.597
it's that, at first,

14:18.720 --> 14:21.473
feelings run very high
in this sort of a situation.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.151
And sooner or later,
everything calms down,

14:24.240 --> 14:26.674
and the way ahead becomes much clearer.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.149
The way ahead seems
perfectly obvious to me.

14:47.840 --> 14:48.989
Tea?

14:49.360 --> 14:52.158
This is a labour room,
not a teddy bear's picnic.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.719
It's well sugared.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.916
A long labour like this needs fuel.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.513
And mother needs to be on the bed.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.318
Come on, dear, up we get.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.878
I don't see this lady
delivering without forceps.

15:03.480 --> 15:06.836
The trouble with these Indians is they
panic when a male comes near them.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.150
These Sylheti ladies are very modest.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.231
- Hmm.
- On the district, it took a while

15:11.320 --> 15:13.231
even for the midwives
to gain their trust.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.080
- Hello, Ian.
- Can I ask a favour, Mr Hereward?

15:25.240 --> 15:26.593
Of course.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.273
Is it about your grant forms?

15:29.400 --> 15:30.435
No.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.791
Jamila, good.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.438
You're doing very well, indeed.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.678
Baby's almost here. One last push.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.313
- Boy?
- Yes.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.359
Do you want to hold him?

16:05.520 --> 16:06.999
Just for a moment, please.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.834
Let's put the baby on the scales.
See what we are up against.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.439
Four pounds, seven ounces.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.473
We've had smaller,
and they've done very well in the main.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.957
Of course, the care here is
known to be exemplary.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.713
The baby is well, Jamila.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.197
Soon, you can have your cup of tea.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.716
Hey! Hey, there, treacle.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.236
I thought I'd wait
and walk back with you.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.989
Should we take the detour?
Come on, I'll buy you a 99.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.794
I don't want a 99.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.512
And I don't want you to go mad.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.588
But you will.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.616
You will do the right thing
by my daughter. Do you hear me?

17:11.640 --> 17:13.359
- Dad, stop it.
- That's enough, Mr Lanyard.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.240
We have enough on our plates
without having to send for an ambulance.

17:29.240 --> 17:32.630
Thank you. Ian, come and sit down, too.

17:37.920 --> 17:42.072
We can discuss the subject
of marriage, together.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.479
We won't be doing anything together,
if he goes off to university.

17:46.560 --> 17:50.519
If I get a degree, I can be a teacher
or write for the papers.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.839
I could work for the BBC making
programmes about poetry.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.880
I could put better food on the table
than you've ever seen in your life.

17:58.360 --> 17:59.952
I can be proud of how I put it there.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.760
But it's going to take three years.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.752
You haven't got three years, Ian.
You've got seven months.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.315
Delia.

18:25.680 --> 18:26.908
There's no one here.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.157
There's nobody watching. Nobody but us.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.029
- You waited up.
- Yes.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.472
It's what we dreamed of, wasn't it?

18:37.920 --> 18:39.751
When we were planning the flat

18:40.280 --> 18:42.111
before our future got interrupted.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.914
Do you know, Dels, in my whole life
I never once had anyone wait up for me.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.320
I bet you've never had anyone make you

18:50.360 --> 18:53.511
a cup of Bournvita with a tot
of Johnnie Walker in it, either.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.869
While you were out, I was thinking,
"I'm gonna unpin her hair,"

18:58.080 --> 19:00.640
"let it fall down to her shoulders
and run my hands through it."

19:00.720 --> 19:02.216
But you've gone so mad with the lacquer,

19:02.240 --> 19:04.880
you could pull out every kirby grip
and the beehive wouldn't budge.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.871
Trixie knows about us, Tom.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.711
- Has she said so?
- She doesn't have to.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.395
She's my friend.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.870
I eat my meals with her.
We share a bathroom.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.793
I can tell when she's unhappy.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.640
Maybe she's unhappy
about something else.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.960
Well, that'd be convenient, wouldn't it?

19:25.840 --> 19:27.068
That's not what I meant.

19:27.360 --> 19:30.591
Tom, it's been a year since
you broke off your engagement.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.148
I agree,
we should have both got over it.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.712
And that wasn't what I meant.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.474
I meant that I can see that
she's still struggling, but...

19:41.480 --> 19:43.840
I didn't think that you'd say
that you were struggling, too.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.994
Neither did I.

19:48.800 --> 19:49.800
I see.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.439
- I'm sorry.
- No.

19:53.520 --> 19:54.794
No, Tom, I'm sorry

19:55.240 --> 19:56.912
that I made you tell the truth.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.638
Because telling the truth is
sometimes harder than telling lies,

20:02.560 --> 20:05.080
which is something I've had to do
rather more than I would like.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.995
And I would've had to do far more
in the future, if we'd carried on.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.435
Who's to say we're not gonna carry on?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.197
Barbara, I love and I value
every single minute,

20:16.520 --> 20:18.317
every hour I spend with you.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.075
Afternoon, Tom. Afternoon, Barbara.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.038
That's not enough, Tom.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.474
Not when we're causing pain
to someone else.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.433
And certainly not
when it's causing pain to us.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.996
You really are the sweetest,
loveliest girl I ever met.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.309
I'm not.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.839
I'm 23. I'm a nurse.

20:54.440 --> 20:57.318
And what nurses do when
they see pain is try to stop it.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.993
Sorry to interrupt
ministerial business, Mr Hereward.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.550
Nurse Gilbert,
Ruby Cottingham's in labour.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.350
It sounds as though
things are moving rapidly.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.318
- Will there be time for lunch?
- I strongly suspect not.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.073
I've packed us hardboiled egg apiece
and some coconut tart.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.039
Hay fever?

21:19.200 --> 21:20.553
Come on, get in the car.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.673
I think we need to refer you
to the hospital for tests.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.670
I've been coughing on and off for years.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.674
Everybody does around here.

21:36.480 --> 21:39.233
They said, we'd all be cured
after the Clean Air Act.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.874
The Clean Air Act wouldn't have had
much of an impact

21:41.960 --> 21:43.951
on conditions inside Heywoods,
Mrs Bulmer.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.398
We need to rule out emphysema.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.712
It's emphysema what did for my husband.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.872
I'm a widow, I need to work.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.794
You've a strapping grown-up son,
Mrs Bulmer.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.478
- He could take care of you now.
- I wish I had your confidence.

22:03.240 --> 22:04.832
Good.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.191
Good lass.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.317
That's another one
you can put behind you.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.394
What do you reckon my chances
of a girl are this time around?

22:16.480 --> 22:19.438
I would say 50%.
What do you think, Nurse Crane?

22:19.680 --> 22:22.478
Mathematical probability
was never my strong suit.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.996
I think you'll find
it isn't Mother Nature's either.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.153
I thought I'll be done by now.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.831
These pains started 12 hours ago.

22:30.560 --> 22:32.320
It wasn't even like this
when I had my first.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.478
If you'd let me examine you internally,
we can try to see what's going on.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.150
Yeah, right. I've had enough.

22:38.560 --> 22:39.913
Come on, you take my hand.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.200
Give it a good squeeze
if things aren't too comfortable.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.028
Brow presentation.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.875
- I'll telephone doctor.
- He'll be on his house calls.

23:06.520 --> 23:09.512
It's like being crushed by an elephant.
Bet you've heard that one before.

23:09.600 --> 23:12.478
Elephants, rhinos, hippopotami.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.876
And to extend the comparison,
this baby's being a monkey.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.791
Not quite tucking its chin down
as it should, I suspect.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.114
You might both do better
if we send you off to hospital.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.555
Hospital?

23:24.800 --> 23:27.314
Nurse Gilbert, can you nip down
the street to the telephone?

23:27.880 --> 23:30.474
Flying squad or ordinary ambulance,
whichever's quicker.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.917
Ruby's already had a very long day.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.550
She has. I'll be back in two ticks.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.117
There's no need for you to worry.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.553
Many, many congratulations, Ian.
And Linda.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.713
And now, I suppose
I ought to ask to see the ring.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.875
It's lovely.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.554
He sold his dad's long-service watch
to pay for it.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.269
Didn't you, Ian?

23:56.960 --> 23:59.394
- Nurse Franklin.
- Nurse!

24:01.160 --> 24:02.718
Look, we're engaged.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.234
How perfectly lovely! Let's see.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.233
You're a lucky girl, Linda.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.640
This is more than just
a piece of jewellery.

24:12.520 --> 24:16.513
It's proof that you found a man
that will put you first, always.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.511
And that really is a very
rare and precious thing.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.872
What happens now?
What are you gonna do?

24:32.120 --> 24:34.111
Doctor's going to help
your baby to be born, dear.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.273
Sister Julienne.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.309
- Mrs Cottingham?
- It's all gone wrong, Sister.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.669
Her cervix is not fully dilated.

24:50.680 --> 24:53.672
I can't get my fingers
between the cervix and the head.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.711
It's so swollen.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.433
It's all right, Ruby.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.440
I'd be screaming my head off
if you weren't here.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.675
No, you wouldn't. You've been a warrior.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.076
It's your own courage
that's got you this far.

25:06.320 --> 25:07.878
Definitely a brow presentation.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.998
Check foetal heart rate, please, Sister.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.839
- I need more gas.
- Eighty.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.233
- I can't keep on any more.
- Seventy.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.679
- Sixty.
- Right, emergency caesarean section.

25:26.920 --> 25:30.549
Anaesthetist and paediatrician, please.
As quickly as you can, please.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.518
- Look after her.
- Who?

25:32.880 --> 25:34.552
My little girl.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.828
I'll be asleep when she's born,
will you look after her?

25:38.520 --> 25:41.034
I will, I promise you.

25:45.680 --> 25:46.715
Thanks very much.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.232
- Hey there, Reverend.
- Mr Lanyard.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.496
I thought I'd offer the happy
couple my congratulations.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.511
Grab yourself a paper plate
and something to eat.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.760
Two types of pork pie
and a trifle as big as your head.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.035
Oh, have an orange juice,

26:03.200 --> 26:05.395
seeing as you're a man of the cloth.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.549
Joyce.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.552
- Hello, Trixie.
- Hello, Tom.

26:27.680 --> 26:30.120
Linda's father saw me passing
and hauled me in off the street.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.434
I didn't like to refuse.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.393
And they poured me a glass of Babycham.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.232
Even though I'm in my uniform.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.515
Well, that's easily dealt with.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.118
Cheers.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.275
Cheers.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.597
Blood pressure, 80 over 40.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.508
Low. I'm not wasting any time.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.237
Uterus exposed.
Suction and oxygen all ready?

27:17.440 --> 27:20.352
In the anteroom, sir.
Paediatrician is on his way.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.349
Proceeding.

27:37.360 --> 27:40.397
Oh, God. Another one.

27:41.080 --> 27:42.149
It's alive.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.033
Somebody take it.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.517
Can we all turn our attention
back to the mother, please?

28:13.200 --> 28:14.997
All right. All right.
Quiet down, folks.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.399
I've got a few words to say.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.548
I ain't one of the world's talkers.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.354
So, I'll keep me words to a minimum.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.788
Not for me son-in-law to be,
I bet he likes long words.

28:29.080 --> 28:32.277
But let's just say the happy news
has meant a change of plan.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.998
And as most of us are proper
Heywood's Paints families,

28:37.320 --> 28:38.878
I've managed to pull a few strings.

28:41.480 --> 28:42.833
Open it, son.

28:50.400 --> 28:54.029
Welcome to the factory.
You start work tomorrow.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.549
I've come to enquire
about baby Cottingham.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.116
Baby Cottingham?

29:31.640 --> 29:35.076
The very poorly baby
that was born this evening.

29:35.920 --> 29:38.354
We've had two admissions today,
but none since noon.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.389
Thank you.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.110
No, no, no!

30:19.640 --> 30:21.232
Can you hear me, little one?

30:26.280 --> 30:29.989
The Lord who created you said
"Don't be afraid, I have redeemed you."

30:31.320 --> 30:32.878
"I've called you by your name."

30:34.160 --> 30:35.434
"You are mine."

30:36.800 --> 30:38.960
"When you pass through the waters,
I will be with you."

30:41.400 --> 30:44.676
"When you pass through the flames,
you will not burn."

30:46.240 --> 30:48.435
"You are precious in my eyes."

30:52.040 --> 30:54.395
This baby is still breathing.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.589
We couldn't have saved it.

30:58.480 --> 31:02.029
But to leave it alone,
cold and trembling...

31:02.480 --> 31:03.833
And possibly in pain.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.920
The anaesthetic from the mother
should still be in its system.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.188
It shouldn't suffer.

31:10.640 --> 31:11.868
And it cannot live.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.149
But it's living now.

31:14.760 --> 31:17.069
And it has been for an hour or more.

31:17.160 --> 31:20.550
Sister, this was the kinder way.

31:22.200 --> 31:25.192
We couldn't even tell
whether it was male or female.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.714
May the Lord bless you and keep you.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.713
May He make his face shine upon you.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.790
And be gracious unto you
and grant you peace.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.229
I think it's gone.

31:53.320 --> 31:54.594
It hasn't been baptised.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.357
I should've baptised it myself.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.473
You don't have to be a priest to
christen a baby, did you know that?

32:04.880 --> 32:05.915
No, I didn't.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.633
The burial will be a decent one.
We can arrange for that.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.876
But there will have to be a post-mortem.

32:14.840 --> 32:15.976
It's the third baby we've delivered

32:16.000 --> 32:18.912
with these sorts of malformations
in the last 12 months.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.714
May I tell Mrs Cottingham
when she wakes from her operation?

32:25.920 --> 32:28.514
The rules state that we don't go into
the post-natal ward.

32:29.640 --> 32:30.709
Yes.

32:33.240 --> 32:34.878
And sometimes, rules are best broken.

32:38.360 --> 32:39.440
But leave it till tomorrow.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.080
I'm not drunk, Mr Hereward.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.155
Giving up something
you really want is hard.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.193
I know that.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.315
You do?

33:05.920 --> 33:08.912
I once had a job at a record shop
that I really, really loved.

33:09.760 --> 33:11.876
And I had to pack it in
to do my national service.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.838
I spent two years in Kinloss
with a dance set,

33:15.920 --> 33:19.310
with a broken needle
and a pile of jazz LPs I couldn't play.

33:21.520 --> 33:22.919
And then God came calling.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.478
And He was a bit of a taskmaster.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.760
And don't get me started on girls.

33:28.760 --> 33:29.795
Nor me.

33:32.040 --> 33:33.234
Ian, do you love Linda?

33:36.080 --> 33:39.072
I don't love her more than anything else
in the world, Mr Hereward.

33:40.400 --> 33:41.960
You love her enough to do what's right.

33:44.040 --> 33:46.474
And sometimes.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.039
Enough love is enough.

33:49.600 --> 33:50.635
It has to be.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.117
We sang Psalm 40 at compline tonight.

34:03.880 --> 34:07.668
Which brought to mind our
forthcoming homage to Sister Hildegard.

34:09.239 --> 34:13.074
I am attempting to give advice
to Sister Mary Cynthia.

34:13.159 --> 34:15.196
And it's very useful advice,

34:15.800 --> 34:18.917
but I did tell Sister Monica Joan
we could talk about it in the morning

34:19.000 --> 34:20.433
after the great...

34:21.679 --> 34:24.274
Our sister greatly seeks replenishment.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.315
In prayer.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.638
There's supper for you in the kitchen.

34:31.480 --> 34:34.199
I'll warm it up, but first things first.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.598
I saw a baby lost today.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.594
It was brutal...

34:43.239 --> 34:44.309
And unbearable.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.512
I'm not sure if I did enough.

35:02.720 --> 35:03.789
Sister Monica Joan,

35:05.680 --> 35:10.310
do you suppose that
it's ever acceptable to tell a lie?

35:12.360 --> 35:16.717
I think the question is
not if it's acceptable,

35:17.920 --> 35:19.194
but if it is kind.

35:20.840 --> 35:21.909
I don't know.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.950
But I do know that telling the truth
would be cruel. So cruel.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.231
Then there can be no virtue in it.

35:29.720 --> 35:30.755
No.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.630
Corned beef and a bit of pan yan pickle.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.313
Linda will have more modern ideas.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.776
You'll be getting miniature
sausage rolls off her

35:52.800 --> 35:54.000
like you see in the magazines.

35:55.440 --> 35:56.475
Thanks.

35:59.160 --> 36:00.280
You look just like your dad.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.757
I've delivered babies with
pathologies before, but this...

36:07.680 --> 36:09.477
It was completely limbless.

36:09.560 --> 36:10.834
Like little Susan Mullucks?

36:11.440 --> 36:13.590
Without even an indication of gender.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.557
What did Mr Kenley say?

36:16.000 --> 36:17.035
He said,

36:17.440 --> 36:19.078
"Oh, God. Another one."

36:19.600 --> 36:20.635
"Another one"?

36:21.520 --> 36:23.636
He's had nothing to do with Susan.

36:24.160 --> 36:26.276
If she was born here
in the maternity home...

36:26.720 --> 36:28.680
Well, that's why I thought
I ought to come to you.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.074
Did it live?

36:32.400 --> 36:33.913
Mrs Cottingham doesn't know yet.

36:34.760 --> 36:35.829
I undertook to tell her.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.832
What became of the other children?

36:38.160 --> 36:39.991
- Did they die, too?
- I'm not sure.

36:40.360 --> 36:43.352
Sister Knowles said that one of them
has been transferred to, um,

36:43.440 --> 36:44.759
a residential hospital.

36:44.840 --> 36:46.592
There's been no clear directive.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.478
No official notification
of any sort of cluster.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.394
Timothy! You're going to be
late for school.

36:54.520 --> 36:56.636
Mrs Gillespie asked me
to climb on her toilet roof

36:56.720 --> 36:57.789
to get her cat down.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.136
When you have a paper round,
helping old ladies

37:00.160 --> 37:01.593
becomes an occupational hazard.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.716
Go home and comb your hair.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.109
Your tie and biscuit money
are on the sideboard.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.278
I brought Dad's <i>Lancet.</i>

37:08.360 --> 37:09.696
Unless you're too busy to read it today,

37:09.720 --> 37:11.472
I could take it and read it on the bus.

37:11.560 --> 37:12.595
No. Leave it here.

37:13.480 --> 37:14.959
I shall expect a tip at Christmas.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.075
There's nothing in the list of contents.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.072
Why would there be?

37:25.160 --> 37:27.515
Until somebody
somewhere tells us otherwise,

37:27.840 --> 37:30.149
we have to look at this
as a local phenomenon.

37:30.920 --> 37:32.239
A local problem.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.788
- Which means it's our problem.
- Quite.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.136
There's no need to keep
hiding your hand.

38:03.160 --> 38:04.480
You've got a ring on your finger.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.560
- It's not a wedding ring, though.
- Yet.

38:07.920 --> 38:09.558
I'm actually rubbing my back.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.792
I'm all achy at the bottom of it.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.056
They won't want to see you for a month,
once you're all booked in.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.600
You'll have your band of gold by then.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.400
It only takes three weeks
to call the bands.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.432
I know. Mr Hereward said.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.275
Linda Lanyard?

38:25.200 --> 38:26.997
May I take this one, Nurse Gilbert?

38:27.320 --> 38:28.469
Of course.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.198
I haven't boiled any urine today.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.120
It would be quite nice
to get a change of pace.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.757
Hello, Linda. How are you?

38:34.840 --> 38:37.673
On the bed. Heels to bottom
and knees nice and wide apart.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.920
- They did warn me about this.
- You'll get used to it.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.136
Some of the old hands come with
their knickers in their pockets

38:43.160 --> 38:44.840
and don't put them on
until we've finished.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.270
Linda, have you been
having any spotting?

38:55.480 --> 38:56.515
What's spotting?

38:57.440 --> 38:58.668
Losing little amounts of blood

38:58.760 --> 39:00.440
as you would
at the beginning of a monthly.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.589
Only early on.

39:03.440 --> 39:05.590
I kept thinking I was about to stop,
but I didn't.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.235
Linda...

39:12.240 --> 39:14.117
I'm afraid you're bleeding now.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.000
And it looks like a little more
than spotting.

39:41.520 --> 39:42.555
Try to stay still.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.154
When can I see my baby?

39:48.520 --> 39:49.555
Ruby...

39:51.680 --> 39:53.193
I'm so very, very sorry

39:53.280 --> 39:56.511
but your poor little baby was born

39:57.800 --> 39:59.438
so desperately unwell.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.760
And it wasn't possible for us
to save it.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.389
Did it die?

40:08.160 --> 40:09.559
Yes, Ruby, in my arms.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.108
Was it a girl?

40:35.360 --> 40:36.429
Yes.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.429
I knew.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.229
Always knew.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.149
Yes.

40:46.920 --> 40:47.955
Yes, you did.

40:51.880 --> 40:52.949
Did she cry?

40:54.720 --> 40:55.755
A little.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.958
But when she took her last breath,

41:01.680 --> 41:03.432
she was warm and safe.

41:06.320 --> 41:09.153
And I believe, she was aware
she was loved.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.037
I wished so hard for her.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.553
Maybe I shouldn't have...

41:26.080 --> 41:27.877
Maybe I'm being punished.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.639
- God knows I love my boys.
- He does.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.992
You did nothing wrong.

41:36.880 --> 41:37.949
Then why?

41:47.400 --> 41:48.958
I wish I could answer that.

41:50.280 --> 41:53.431
And I wish I could bring your baby back.

41:55.040 --> 41:56.075
But I can't.

41:59.320 --> 42:00.469
Listen to us, eh?

42:02.280 --> 42:04.953
Wishing this and wishing that.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.951
We haven't got
a fairy godmother between us.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.556
Linda?

42:18.920 --> 42:21.559
Linda, I know this is
a perfectly ghastly business,

42:22.400 --> 42:23.469
but you're not alone.

42:25.760 --> 42:26.829
There's more blood.

42:28.240 --> 42:31.755
Don't cry. It's a natural process,
it will be over soon.

42:34.440 --> 42:37.113
Something's come away! Nurse?

42:37.640 --> 42:39.471
It's all right, Linda. It's all right.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.478
When you're ready, open the door.

42:43.480 --> 42:45.080
But I don't want you to flush,
all right?

42:49.160 --> 42:51.993
Afternoon, Mr Lanyard.
How's the young bridegroom shaping up?

42:52.680 --> 42:55.399
Don't ask me.
Little toe rag never even clocked on.

43:01.840 --> 43:05.355
Spontaneous miscarriage.
Foetus looked to be about eight weeks.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.432
Oh, no. Poor wee girl.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.754
We'll take her back to Sadie's
and get her tucked up in bed.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.111
Call Doctor, if you have any concerns.

43:14.360 --> 43:15.713
What the poor pet really needs

43:16.400 --> 43:19.756
is a good cry, a couple of aspirin
and a hug, in no particular order.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.550
But the hug is of prime importance.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.069
Ian?

43:33.080 --> 43:34.115
Ian?

43:47.400 --> 43:50.161
- What the hell are you doing?
- Ian's in the house and the gas is on.

43:54.040 --> 43:56.600
Stay outside.

44:09.520 --> 44:10.589
He's still breathing.

44:16.880 --> 44:18.279
Ian? Ian?

44:18.520 --> 44:21.398
Take deep breaths.
Try to take deep breaths.

44:24.240 --> 44:25.514
I'm sorry.

44:26.040 --> 44:28.076
It's all right,
you've done nothing wrong.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.434
- He even missed my shoes.
- He got mine, though.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.151
Head up, sweetie.
We'll get you through this.

44:42.680 --> 44:46.798
There's no obvious similarity between
Rhoda Mullucks and Ruby Cottingham.

44:47.720 --> 44:51.599
Other than them both being multiparous
mothers and on the older side.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.840
Don't think they'd
thank you for that, Patrick.

44:54.120 --> 44:55.633
They're both younger than me.

44:56.760 --> 44:59.228
Meanwhile, Keith Cottingham
is in the Navy.

44:59.760 --> 45:03.878
Hmm. It says here that
he had his appendix out,

45:04.160 --> 45:06.799
on land, in New Zealand in 1957.

45:08.160 --> 45:11.709
So, he could've been involved in
the H-bomb tests. We'd have to check.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.035
The H-bomb?

45:13.440 --> 45:15.431
- Hello.
- Hello, dear.

45:15.960 --> 45:18.269
Deformed babies
have been born in the South Seas.

45:18.760 --> 45:21.115
There's one school of thought
that blames nuclear testing.

45:21.360 --> 45:24.909
It happened after Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, too. We did it in history.

45:26.600 --> 45:28.716
So, World War II is history now, is it?

45:29.000 --> 45:30.399
We do exams in it and everything.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.839
Can I wash some equipment?

45:33.320 --> 45:35.311
- How much are you charging?
- The usual.

45:36.160 --> 45:37.878
- Bike fund?
- Yes.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.231
Go through to the sluice.
I'll catch you up.

45:42.520 --> 45:43.800
But going back to the mothers...

45:44.280 --> 45:47.875
And neither Rhoda nor Ruby has anything
out of the ordinary on their records.

45:49.200 --> 45:51.589
Only the usual juvenile illnesses.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.350
Plus occasional antibiotics.

45:54.960 --> 45:58.077
And other routine drugs in adulthood.

45:59.640 --> 46:02.234
Oh, come here. There we go.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.920
I'm sorry, we'll be taking work
home with us tonight.

46:08.080 --> 46:10.594
No university place.
Now, no baby.

46:10.880 --> 46:12.472
And engaged for no good reason.

46:13.920 --> 46:16.753
If he tries to walk away he could
be sued for breach of promise.

46:18.200 --> 46:20.191
A broken engagement is a serious thing.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.069
Isn't it?

46:23.400 --> 46:24.913
Trixie, that is not what I meant.

46:27.120 --> 46:28.872
How long since we ended everything?

46:30.160 --> 46:31.195
A year.

46:32.880 --> 46:35.599
To be more precise, a year and 10 days.

46:42.240 --> 46:44.176
Once upon a time,
one of us would've leaned forward

46:44.200 --> 46:45.633
to kiss the other one just then.

46:47.520 --> 46:48.999
I know.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.274
But neither of us did.

46:52.440 --> 46:53.509
No.

46:54.920 --> 46:56.353
When you look at Barbara,

46:57.520 --> 46:59.120
do you want to lean forward
and kiss her?

47:00.520 --> 47:01.555
Sometimes.

47:02.480 --> 47:04.550
- I've done. Once or twice.
- Oh.

47:04.680 --> 47:06.796
But don't worry, it won't happen again.

47:07.960 --> 47:09.518
If we were ever going out at all,

47:10.080 --> 47:12.275
Barbara ended it because of you.

47:13.120 --> 47:15.236
Or more precisely,
because of you and me.

47:17.120 --> 47:19.111
I think it's time
to let each other go, Trixie.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.080
- I thought we did that last year.
- It's hanging on.

47:22.960 --> 47:24.080
Not letting each other grow.

47:26.120 --> 47:27.314
It's a recipe for misery.

47:29.720 --> 47:30.755
Yes.

47:31.320 --> 47:33.914
And vomit on one's shoes,
as we found out earlier this evening.

47:34.880 --> 47:36.996
So, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go and get changed.

47:37.800 --> 47:39.552
I don't feel at all comfortable.

47:45.760 --> 47:47.557
This seems to be our only clue

47:47.640 --> 47:50.074
that these anomalies are
part of something more widespread.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.991
This residential hospital that

47:53.080 --> 47:55.355
specialises in children
with malformed limbs.

47:56.200 --> 47:59.351
It's not a new hospital.
But it is a new specialisation.

48:00.480 --> 48:02.072
It may mean nothing at all.

48:04.280 --> 48:06.077
Patrick, we have to go to bed.

48:06.920 --> 48:09.036
We have patients to care for
in the morning.

48:09.320 --> 48:12.312
They don't need us crawling in
half-dead through lack of sleep.

48:17.720 --> 48:19.240
I never know when I love you the most,

48:20.280 --> 48:23.033
but I sometimes think that these
are the times that I love you best.

48:24.560 --> 48:27.438
When the whole world's sleeping
and you're sitting up,

48:27.840 --> 48:29.751
with dark rings beneath your eyes,

48:30.680 --> 48:32.238
just trying to make it better.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.155
Oh, Shelagh.

48:40.160 --> 48:43.038
We had a wonderful old professor
when I was at medical school.

48:44.360 --> 48:45.839
Macatin Phipps.

48:47.040 --> 48:48.393
He was a real physician.

48:49.160 --> 48:51.151
Cared about patients, inside and out.

48:52.360 --> 48:53.759
And he used to say,

48:54.320 --> 48:57.596
"Never be afraid to say
when you don't know the answer."

49:00.600 --> 49:01.828
But these babies...

49:03.600 --> 49:04.999
Shelagh, I don't know.

49:06.160 --> 49:08.993
And I don't know if there
is anything to know.

49:11.920 --> 49:13.319
And I'm scared.

49:16.960 --> 49:18.632
She had a reasonable night.

49:19.440 --> 49:21.192
I tucked her up in bed next to me.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.080
You're as good as a mum
to Linda, Sadie, I know that.

49:25.240 --> 49:28.516
Which is just what most girls need
after an experience like yours.

49:29.600 --> 49:33.275
Will you look in on Ian?
Nurse, before you go, only...

49:35.440 --> 49:37.431
Only we heard him crying in the night.

49:38.040 --> 49:40.440
There's no harm in me popping
my head around the door, but...

49:40.520 --> 49:42.158
There's no need, Nurse.

49:43.520 --> 49:45.988
I'm all right, and I'm going to work.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.753
No, son. No, you're not.

49:53.120 --> 49:54.155
Here.

49:55.080 --> 49:56.656
I rather think I ought to take my leave.

49:56.680 --> 49:59.353
No, Nurse, this isn't some big drama.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.159
I'm just doing the right thing.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.234
Like you did the right thing.

50:07.640 --> 50:10.677
I didn't say I wanted to marry you
because it was the right thing, Linda.

50:11.880 --> 50:13.359
It was because I loved you.

50:14.880 --> 50:15.995
And I love you now.

50:16.640 --> 50:18.949
Take it. Sell it.

50:20.480 --> 50:22.835
Spend it on the books
you'll read at university.

50:24.880 --> 50:26.233
I'm not standing in your way.

50:27.640 --> 50:29.756
There's no baby going to now, either.

50:31.760 --> 50:34.433
I've still got responsibilities.
I've got Mum.

50:34.680 --> 50:36.159
Don't you worry about me, son.

50:37.240 --> 50:39.496
You can come home and listen to me
coughing in the holidays.

50:39.520 --> 50:41.476
But you don't have to do it
all year around.

50:44.520 --> 50:45.589
Take the ring, Ian.

50:54.760 --> 50:55.760
All right.

50:57.320 --> 51:00.118
There. There it is,
and there it's staying

51:01.000 --> 51:02.877
till you've got letters after your name

51:03.040 --> 51:05.110
and more ahead of you
than me and your dad ever had.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.718
Let's not argue with your mum, Ian.

51:10.840 --> 51:15.072
You won't win. And we can wait.

51:20.400 --> 51:23.517
You can't stand in the way
of what life wants, can you, Nurse?

51:25.280 --> 51:26.633
Or what love wants.

51:27.520 --> 51:30.910
One way or another,
things end up how they should.

51:53.760 --> 51:55.080
You need to have the big light on

51:55.160 --> 51:57.000
if you're going to do
handicrafts at this hour.

51:57.560 --> 51:58.595
It's all right.

51:58.680 --> 52:01.911
It's only a few figures for the Bible
study fuzzy felt at Sunday school.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.576
Judas and Simon Peter have gone missing,

52:04.600 --> 52:06.033
and Mary Magdalene's got no head.

52:07.680 --> 52:10.592
I hope Mr Hereward
appreciates your dedication.

52:12.280 --> 52:13.554
I don't care if he doesn't.

52:15.520 --> 52:17.636
Enter.

52:20.360 --> 52:22.954
Barbara, may I speak
to you for a moment?

52:24.240 --> 52:26.310
I suppose it's time
I did my vanishing act.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.353
Or as we say in Spanish class...

52:39.320 --> 52:42.471
I think we need to <i>converse</i>
about Cousin Mabel.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.518
There's no such person, Trixie.

52:47.880 --> 52:50.235
I made her up, so that
I didn't have to tell you the truth.

52:51.560 --> 52:55.155
But there's really no truth to tell now,
so it doesn't matter.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.590
Yes. It does.

53:06.280 --> 53:07.599
I'm so sorry, Trixie.

53:08.800 --> 53:11.314
I knew you knew.
I knew you were unhappy.

53:12.320 --> 53:15.278
And I should've ended it sooner,
but I didn't have the courage.

53:16.080 --> 53:17.638
And I had too much hope,

53:18.440 --> 53:19.475
probably.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.599
Tom's special, isn't he?

53:23.320 --> 53:24.355
Yes.

53:26.440 --> 53:29.113
But not so special that it's worth
all three of us being miserable.

53:29.240 --> 53:31.037
And now, if you don't mind,

53:31.760 --> 53:33.920
I really need to get on
with these fuzzy felt apostles.

53:34.880 --> 53:35.949
Oh, Barbara.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.789
Only a girl as nice as you
would say a thing like that.

53:41.960 --> 53:43.473
What if I'm not nice, Trixie?

53:44.760 --> 53:47.718
What if I'm thinking all sorts of
mean and terrible thoughts inside?

53:49.520 --> 53:50.589
I wouldn't blame you.

53:52.920 --> 53:55.912
And I'm not going to stand
in your way. Or Tom's.

53:57.440 --> 53:59.032
People want what they want.

54:00.080 --> 54:01.399
And, one way or another,

54:02.080 --> 54:04.640
at least, if love comes in to it,

54:05.560 --> 54:06.920
things will end up as they should.

54:38.880 --> 54:42.395
It was Sister Hildegard
who began our work, here in Poplar.

54:43.960 --> 54:46.918
And I and my sisters carry on
that work as best we can,

54:47.840 --> 54:50.229
day by day, night by night,

54:51.240 --> 54:52.355
woman by woman,

54:53.320 --> 54:54.469
child by child.

54:56.080 --> 54:57.991
Her faith was never shaken.

54:59.080 --> 55:01.753
And faith remains
the foundation of our life.

55:02.920 --> 55:04.876
But there are times
when we are challenged.

55:05.840 --> 55:09.674
Not in the vowed life,
but as midwives and nurses.

55:11.840 --> 55:13.512
There are babies born broken.

55:15.240 --> 55:16.480
There are lives we cannot heal.

55:18.400 --> 55:20.675
And it is then that we should
turn to the woman

55:21.000 --> 55:23.798
that so inspired our sister
that she took her name,

55:24.840 --> 55:26.876
Saint Hildegard of Bingen.

55:28.720 --> 55:30.233
Saint Hildegard once said,

55:32.440 --> 55:33.668
"God hugs you."

55:36.480 --> 55:38.198
"God hugs you."

55:38.720 --> 55:42.998
"You are encircled by the arms
of the mystery of God."

55:44.640 --> 55:48.599
"You shine so finely,
it surpasses understanding."

56:01.960 --> 56:03.757
<i>You were so little then,</i>

56:04.000 --> 56:07.276
<i>in a world that seemed
so full of opening doors</i>

56:07.480 --> 56:08.993
<i>and bright horizons,</i>

56:09.200 --> 56:11.839
<i>we thought only of what
was new and better.</i>

56:12.280 --> 56:14.430
<i>Because it was new and better.</i>

56:14.920 --> 56:17.912
<i>And it would take us to places
we had never been before.</i>

56:45.000 --> 56:49.073
<i>We couldn't see what was
coming or understand yet</i>

56:49.560 --> 56:51.630
<i>what had already come to pass.</i>

56:52.320 --> 56:54.834
<i>We had so much still to learn.</i>

57:04.920 --> 57:08.390
Who else will tell me stories?
Tell me where frankincense came from.

57:08.600 --> 57:11.114
- We have an emergency.
- I shall go at once.

57:11.400 --> 57:12.435
Whoa!

57:12.520 --> 57:16.957
That's it, ladies. If we want to reduce,
we must keep moving.

57:18.560 --> 57:22.553
Tar and tumours
from those bloody cigarettes.

57:22.880 --> 57:24.438
She used to call me a movie star.

57:25.120 --> 57:27.680
I can feel the pounds falling off.

57:28.520 --> 57:29.748
Hello, anyone at home?
