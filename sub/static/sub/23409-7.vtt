<i>Previously on</i> Burden of Truth:

00:04.019 --> 00:05.274
I believe the girls suffer
from conversion disorder.

00:05.320 --> 00:07.002
You were supposed to
link the benzene to the

00:07.027 --> 00:08.744
girls' symptoms, not come
up with a new theory.

00:08.790 --> 00:11.830
<i>So Steve, someone you were
close with, committed suicide</i>

00:11.830 --> 00:15.200
and the tremors started
after that, right?

00:15.270 --> 00:18.730
- You're David Hanley's daughter?
- Yeah.

00:18.740 --> 00:20.900
[grunting]

00:20.970 --> 00:24.010
<i>Can you think of anyone
who might wanna do this?</i>

00:24.070 --> 00:25.670
<i>CTS, my old law firm.</i>

00:25.680 --> 00:29.180
It's over. Enjoy your cure.

00:36.090 --> 00:38.890
<i>How do you know
when a lawyer's lying?</i>

00:38.960 --> 00:42.290

01:01.040 --> 01:05.110
So, you're not going to court?

01:05.180 --> 01:07.450
- You're actually giving up on the case?
- I'm not giving up.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.550
There is no case. - I didn't think
you were a quitter, Joanna.

01:10.620 --> 01:12.650
We can't win with what we have.

01:16.890 --> 01:20.260
At least show up. Billy's going to
throw up a hail Mary and he needs help.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.600
Hail Mary's aren't
exactly my style.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.070
We built the entire case
around the barrels in the field

01:25.070 --> 01:27.370
and now you're telling me you
think it's conversion disorder?

01:27.440 --> 01:29.640
I just know what we can
prove and what we can't.

01:31.670 --> 01:35.080
The truth and legal proof
are not the same thing.

01:35.140 --> 01:38.680
Every time that we say benzene,
they're gonna argue conversion.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.680
It's gonna confuse a jury.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.820
So? You can explain it
in a way they'll understand.

01:42.890 --> 01:46.990
Whenever there are two alternate
theories, people will always believe

01:47.060 --> 01:50.630
the most convenient one. The one
that doesn't come at a price.

01:50.690 --> 01:54.360
Conversion disorder absolves
the Mill and it saves Millwood.

01:57.570 --> 02:00.640
I'll be in the truck.

02:02.510 --> 02:06.270
He will get over it.

02:11.180 --> 02:12.950
Dr. Williams, what are the steps

02:13.020 --> 02:15.980
- involved in diagnosing conversion disorder?
- Objection,

02:16.050 --> 02:18.150
Your Honour. Our expert
has already provided

02:18.220 --> 02:20.150
a full explanation
in the motion materials.

02:20.220 --> 02:22.660
I think it's important for us
to understand the steps.

02:22.660 --> 02:24.830
Be brief, Counselor Crawford.

02:24.890 --> 02:27.330
Thank you. Alright.

02:27.400 --> 02:31.000
So, take me through it. A
patient walks into your office.

02:31.070 --> 02:32.770
Now what?

02:32.840 --> 02:35.340
We look for symptoms
of altered motor function

02:35.410 --> 02:38.870
not better explained by other
medical or mental disorders.

02:38.940 --> 02:41.610
So conversion disorder
is a diagnosis of exclusion.

02:41.680 --> 02:44.010
The first thing you have to do is
prove it's not something else.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.165
Yes, but there are several
mitigating factors...

02:45.166 --> 02:47.010
Our medical expert

02:47.080 --> 02:49.720
will testify that the symptoms
were caused by exposure

02:49.790 --> 02:52.550
to a toxic chemical, most likely
benzene, which was found buried

02:52.620 --> 02:55.890
- in the girls' athletic field.
- This is not a case of poisoning.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.860
It is conversion disorder.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.860
Is that all for
this witness, counsel?

03:03.430 --> 03:06.370
Not even close, Your Honour.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.540
♪♪♪

03:16.110 --> 03:18.510
<i>Since I got here,
some random person</i>

03:18.580 --> 03:20.780
punched me at the bar,

03:20.850 --> 03:23.380
someone broke into our office,

03:23.390 --> 03:25.850
and I was attacked
in my motel room.

03:25.860 --> 03:28.120
Hm. Not exactly
a stellar homecoming.

03:28.190 --> 03:30.730
I just need to know which
of these things is related

03:30.790 --> 03:32.730
to the case and what is...

03:32.800 --> 03:35.130
- Personal.
- Yeah.

03:35.130 --> 03:37.600
OK.

03:37.670 --> 03:41.400
First, I'd make two columns.
Professional and personal.

03:41.400 --> 03:44.910
The office break-in:
definitely professional.

03:44.970 --> 03:47.540
Motel attack likely too.
You're going after the Mill.

03:47.610 --> 03:50.240
And what about when you said
to me that you thought

03:50.310 --> 03:53.250
you'd never see a Hanley
step foot in town again?

03:56.090 --> 03:59.790
My stepdad used to call
David Hanley the Grim Reaper.

04:01.790 --> 04:04.490
Someone you'd never want
knocking on your door.

04:04.490 --> 04:08.130
We used to live just down
by the water along Front.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.560
My stepdad built
our house himself.

04:10.630 --> 04:13.170
Then, one day,

04:13.240 --> 04:16.170
your father knocks on the door
with legal papers.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.240
Bulldozers right behind him.

04:18.310 --> 04:21.110
- Riverside Park.
- Mm-hmm.

04:21.110 --> 04:24.080
My stepdad refused to sign

04:24.150 --> 04:26.150
and your old man got him fired.

04:26.220 --> 04:29.950
Eventually, he lost the house
to the bank and we ended up

04:30.020 --> 04:32.590
in an apartment the other side
of Willow Road. - I'm sorry.

04:32.660 --> 04:34.620
Wasn't just us.

04:34.690 --> 04:37.860
Seems like everyone in town
has a David Hanley story.

04:37.930 --> 04:40.860
None of them have happy endings.

04:40.930 --> 04:44.670
He always told me
he was a town solicitor.

04:44.730 --> 04:47.030
Doing wills and trusts.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.940
I can see you're working hard
not to be like him.

04:49.940 --> 04:53.140
And failing at it.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.280
Yeah. Gotta get to work.

04:56.350 --> 04:58.950
Owen. Wait.
What about the punch?

04:59.020 --> 05:01.080
Lots of people
get punched at The Boot.

05:01.150 --> 05:03.320
- They don't even need a reason.
- Ahem.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.290
Alright.

05:07.290 --> 05:10.190
I know who,
but I don't know why.

05:12.630 --> 05:15.130
Her name's Amy Carr.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.630
You got an address for me?

05:17.700 --> 05:20.470
Doctor, a differential diagnosis

05:20.540 --> 05:23.570
is simply when two different things
can be mistaken for each other.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.040
Yes.

05:26.110 --> 05:28.140
According to this textbook,

05:28.210 --> 05:30.910
Conversion disorder
is often confused

05:30.910 --> 05:34.420
with Parkinson's,
mood disorders,

05:34.480 --> 05:38.250
and can you read that last entry
at the bottom there?

05:45.400 --> 05:48.400
- Toxic poisoning.
- So,

05:48.460 --> 05:50.800
the differential diagnosis
for the symptoms

05:50.870 --> 05:52.800
exhibited by these girls

05:52.870 --> 05:55.040
is toxic poisoning.

05:55.100 --> 05:57.070
Your Honour, we have
a legitimate issue

05:57.140 --> 05:59.340
on which experts disagree.

05:59.410 --> 06:01.940
It requires a trial, discovery

06:02.010 --> 06:04.210
and a decision
by the trier of fact.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.680
Opposing counsel's argument is
speculative and not plausible.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.550
There is no evidence to tie
the symptoms to toxic poisoning.

06:09.550 --> 06:13.850
We have provided a medically supported
explanation for the plaintiff's symptoms.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.820
We ask the court
to uphold our motion

06:15.890 --> 06:18.130
to dismiss the case against
Matheson Steel and P and L.

06:22.100 --> 06:25.070
Counselor Crawford.

06:25.130 --> 06:27.270
You don't have enough here.

06:28.940 --> 06:31.240
The court rules in favour
of the motion to strike.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.970
The case is dismissed.

06:34.540 --> 06:37.480
- Thank you.
- What the hell happened?

06:41.720 --> 06:44.220
We just lost the case.

06:47.990 --> 06:51.730
Ladies.

06:51.730 --> 06:53.860
Listen,

06:53.860 --> 06:55.860
your lawyer lost in there,

06:55.930 --> 06:59.470
but you won. Now we can
focus on your treatment.

06:59.540 --> 07:02.400
My mom says that your treatment
is not covered by insurance.

07:02.470 --> 07:05.040
No, listen, don't you
worry about that, OK?

07:05.110 --> 07:07.240
I am not leaving here
until you get better.

07:07.310 --> 07:09.340
It's not gonna cost you a cent.

07:09.410 --> 07:12.680
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

07:12.750 --> 07:15.580
This case has been a distraction
to all of you girls.

07:15.650 --> 07:17.690
It's time we find a cure.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.350
All you need to do

07:19.420 --> 07:21.860
is sign this,

07:21.920 --> 07:23.990
and we can get back at it
as soon as possible.

07:24.060 --> 07:26.890
- A non-disclosure agreement?
- Shouldn't we get Billy

07:26.900 --> 07:29.330
- to look this over first?
- This is a standard NDA.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.500
My services normally come at a
premium rate, but I can't afford

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
to treat everyone for free.

07:34.570 --> 07:36.900
Just you girls.

07:36.970 --> 07:39.640
The only thing that I ask for

07:39.710 --> 07:43.540
is a small amount of
discretion. That's all.

07:52.720 --> 07:56.320
That's great.

07:56.390 --> 07:59.630
Listen, it's been a long day.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.560
You should get some rest.

08:01.630 --> 08:03.730
We're gonna get you well.

08:13.680 --> 08:16.680
- [whistling]
- Beckbie.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.880
Been thinking about that
mystery vehicle of yours,

08:19.880 --> 08:21.880
from the other night
at the motel.

08:21.950 --> 08:24.350
- Why? Something turn up?
- No, just...

08:24.420 --> 08:27.190
just a real shame that the
plates got written down wrong.

08:27.260 --> 08:31.090
Yeah. Breaking and
entering, assault,

08:31.090 --> 08:34.500
and we got nothing.
I'd chalk that up as a shame.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.330
Yeah, well, you'll have plenty of time
to investigate on all the data banks.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.830
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't read the schedule?

08:40.900 --> 08:43.700
Your chariot awaits.

08:43.770 --> 08:44.532
Desk duty?

08:44.533 --> 08:47.580
I'll be back in a couple
hours. If you don't mind,

08:47.580 --> 08:50.240
make sure there's a fresh pot of
coffee on, alright, buds? Thanks.

08:50.310 --> 08:52.680
Sam!

08:54.850 --> 08:57.620
[girl coughing]

08:59.660 --> 09:03.120
I'll set up an appointment
with Dr. Williams right away.

09:03.190 --> 09:05.560
You got mail.

09:05.630 --> 09:08.030
From the university.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.530
What makes you think that doctor

09:10.600 --> 09:12.470
will stick around
when the case is over?

09:12.470 --> 09:14.800
Doesn't matter. We'll go to him.

09:14.870 --> 09:16.970
Whatever the cost.
Are you gonna open that?

09:22.810 --> 09:24.980
Taylor,

09:25.050 --> 09:27.880
Dr. Williams can help you.
You're going to get better.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.180
OK? Come on.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.750
Cheer up. We won.

09:32.820 --> 09:35.920
Is this what winning feels like?

09:42.030 --> 09:45.000
<i>So, I was looking</i>

09:45.070 --> 09:49.170
into the academics at McGill
today. They have pre-law.

09:49.170 --> 09:51.570
Pre-law's just
an undergrad degree.

09:51.570 --> 09:54.310
- So you've looked into it?
- I don't wanna get ahead of myself

09:54.310 --> 09:56.110
'cause I haven't even
been accepted yet.

09:56.180 --> 09:59.110
Yeah, but you will.

10:01.180 --> 10:02.980
Are you doing okay?

10:02.990 --> 10:06.090
I think so.

10:07.890 --> 10:10.420
- How's it going with Dr. Williams?
- Good.

10:10.490 --> 10:12.430
I stopped twitching.

10:12.490 --> 10:14.800
Got my cleats on, been kicking
the ball around a little bit.

10:14.860 --> 10:18.270
- Are you sure that's safe?
- I feel okay.

10:18.330 --> 10:20.670
I feel better than okay.
Went for a run yesterday.

10:20.670 --> 10:22.670
All the way to
the bridge and back.

10:22.740 --> 10:25.070
Well, don't push yourself.

10:25.140 --> 10:27.210
It's not worth it.

10:27.210 --> 10:30.610
If I lose my scholarship,
I can't afford to go to school.

10:30.610 --> 10:35.680
We'll figure it out.
We always do.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.960
You taste like cherry.
Where's the candy, Ross?

10:52.270 --> 10:54.370
Shh, shh... Molly.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.600
Hey.

11:21.130 --> 11:24.870
- Yeah? - Hi. I'm looking for Amy Carr.
- Amy's my sister.

11:24.870 --> 11:27.440
She's at work. You're gonna
have to come back later.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.070
I just need a minute.

11:29.070 --> 11:32.510
OK. You gotta make it quick, I
gotta show a house in 20 minutes.

11:34.740 --> 11:37.010
Your sister, uh, punched me

11:37.010 --> 11:38.780
a while back.

11:38.850 --> 11:41.180
I'm just wondering why.

11:41.250 --> 11:44.090
Come in.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.360
- You're in real estate?
- Yeah.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.630
Selling a three-bedroom
house to new parents

11:52.690 --> 11:55.460
who just want out of the city.

11:57.530 --> 11:59.500
She shouldn't have hit you.

11:59.570 --> 12:01.240
It healed.

12:01.300 --> 12:05.110
Yeah, well, I'm sorry she did that.
That would've been my fault.

12:05.170 --> 12:08.780
- Sorry?
- She only hit you because of me.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.250
She doesn't like it
when people hurt me, I guess.

12:11.250 --> 12:14.250
But, I didn't... hurt you.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.280
I don't even know you.

12:16.350 --> 12:18.290
Not you. Um...

12:20.520 --> 12:22.560
I used to work at the Golf Club.

12:22.620 --> 12:25.030
Oh God.

12:25.090 --> 12:27.060
Behind the bar, you know.

12:27.130 --> 12:29.230
You can make some
pretty great money

12:29.300 --> 12:32.600
if you're young and pretty.
And I was.

12:32.670 --> 12:35.600
Men would stick around
long after their rounds,

12:35.670 --> 12:38.270
you know, the sad guys

12:38.270 --> 12:41.510
with the lame jokes and the
comb-overs and the sad stories,

12:41.580 --> 12:43.610
and...

12:43.610 --> 12:46.480
all competing for my attention.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.180
And my father was one of them?

12:51.250 --> 12:53.550
No. He...

12:53.560 --> 12:55.560
he was softer.

12:55.620 --> 12:58.330
He was nice. He listened.

13:00.260 --> 13:02.630
Or he was good
at pretending he was.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.700
Yeah.

13:06.770 --> 13:09.970
He told me I could do anything

13:10.040 --> 13:12.110
and he was gonna help.

13:12.170 --> 13:15.510
Told me I was special.

13:15.510 --> 13:18.880
I would never normally
fall for that crap,

13:18.950 --> 13:22.320
but with him, I don't know.

13:22.380 --> 13:25.520
I liked him.

13:25.590 --> 13:27.560
I knew he was married.

13:29.860 --> 13:32.190
Our kid would've been older now

13:32.200 --> 13:34.790
than I was back then.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.330
I had an abortion.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.840
I was just a kid too.

13:45.540 --> 13:47.810
It's just one of those things.

13:47.880 --> 13:51.010
Is there anything I...

13:51.080 --> 13:53.850
Can I help?

13:53.920 --> 13:57.020
With anything?

13:57.020 --> 14:00.090
You know how you can help?
Wish me luck

14:00.160 --> 14:02.760
with the Martins. They've
got a baby on the way

14:02.760 --> 14:05.190
and I'm pretty sure
that I just found

14:05.260 --> 14:08.560
the perfect spot for them.

14:08.630 --> 14:12.670
Look, this is just
the way life goes.

14:12.730 --> 14:15.300
Right?

14:15.370 --> 14:18.610
And I'm doing pretty
okay right now.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.310
OK.

14:23.380 --> 14:26.910
Good luck.

14:43.870 --> 14:46.730
Excuse me.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.700
OK. [alarm blaring]

14:51.210 --> 14:54.310
Stop. I'm not here
to cause trouble.

14:54.380 --> 14:56.880
- [alarm stops]
- Then what do you want?

14:56.950 --> 14:58.980
Crawford lost the case.

15:02.050 --> 15:05.420
- I wish I could say I was surprised.
- So that's just it then?

15:05.420 --> 15:07.620
The last time one of your pals
tried to take me on,

15:07.620 --> 15:10.460
it didn't go so well for him.
You want to try me?

15:13.430 --> 15:16.160
You were so close.

15:25.910 --> 15:28.510
I can do it. You don't
need to cook for me.

15:28.510 --> 15:31.210
It's not really cooking.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.610
It's mac and cheese.

15:37.090 --> 15:41.460
What? - You're twitching again,
even with the new treatment.

15:43.990 --> 15:47.330
When do you think we admit that
this might be a longer fight?

15:47.330 --> 15:50.760
Yeah, you're right.

15:52.740 --> 15:54.630
You hear from McGill yet?

15:54.640 --> 15:58.040
No. Not yet.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.310
When did you start lying to me?

16:02.380 --> 16:04.680
- I'm not.
- I got my letter saying

16:04.750 --> 16:07.150
that the soccer scholarship's
off the table, so...

16:07.150 --> 16:09.580
- Molly.
- I know you got yours.

16:09.650 --> 16:12.390
I didn't open it, OK?
I don't want to know yet.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.330
You get in.

16:24.200 --> 16:24.786
Are you going?

16:24.787 --> 16:27.130
- No.
- You're going.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.700
I know what a big deal this is for you.
You're too smart to be stuck here.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.040
What if I never get better?

16:35.110 --> 16:37.710
If you stay, you'll
just resent me,

16:37.780 --> 16:40.080
and I can't handle that
on top of everything else.

16:40.150 --> 16:42.080
- What about us?
- I don't know.

16:42.150 --> 16:45.020
You'll feel like an ass for five minutes
and then you'll forget about me.

16:45.090 --> 16:47.014
Five minutes? Is that
how you feel about me?

16:47.015 --> 16:49.060
We're eighteen.

16:49.120 --> 16:52.830
It's not like we were gonna
make it. So go ahead.

16:52.890 --> 16:55.830
You have my permission.

17:11.550 --> 17:14.550
[bell jingling]

17:14.550 --> 17:17.280
- I'm not ready to give up.
- We don't have a choice.

17:17.290 --> 17:20.150
There must be
something else we can file.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.720
You can't just leave Molly
to fight this on her own.

17:22.790 --> 17:27.030
- I'm not leaving her anywhere. And you?
- So what do we do now, huh?

17:27.099 --> 17:29.100
I need to fix this,
like, yesterday.

17:30.370 --> 17:33.900
I got my hopes up that Williams
could help her.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.240
Even with all the warning signs,
his stupid hypnosis,

17:37.240 --> 17:39.940
testifying for the defense,
making Molly sign

17:40.010 --> 17:42.740
- that non-disclosure agreement...
- Molly signed something?

17:44.710 --> 17:47.710
This is the first time
I'm hearing about it.

17:47.780 --> 17:50.050
Yeah, well. It's
too late now anyways.

17:50.050 --> 17:52.390
Maybe not.

18:07.540 --> 18:09.670
Dr. Williams.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.010
Mr. Crawford.

18:12.070 --> 18:14.640
Did we have an appointment that I
forgot about? - No. I just wanted

18:14.710 --> 18:16.640
to talk to you
about my niece, Molly.

18:16.710 --> 18:18.650
Of course.

18:18.710 --> 18:20.680
Molly and I have agreed to work
together on her recovery.

18:20.750 --> 18:24.150
She said you had her sign something. I
just... I'd like to take a look at it.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.090
I'm sorry, but
that's privileged.

18:26.160 --> 18:29.820
- I'm sure you understand.
- Look, as her lawyer,

18:29.890 --> 18:33.360
it's in Molly's best interest for me to
review everything related to her recovery.

18:33.430 --> 18:35.900
Your niece has enlisted
my help with that recovery.

18:35.960 --> 18:38.030
To that end, I must
make sure that anything

18:38.100 --> 18:40.100
pertaining to her treatment
remains strictly confidential.

18:40.170 --> 18:42.370
Just let me see the document.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.370
Unless you got
something to hide.

18:44.370 --> 18:48.310
I think I've made myself
clear. If you'll excuse me.

18:59.650 --> 19:02.520
I didn't know they could take
away a university acceptance.

19:04.730 --> 19:07.660
The offers can be conditional
on your final marks.

19:10.670 --> 19:13.130
I worked so hard,
Ms. Evans. You know me.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.140
You're one of our best students.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.470
But I sat down in my economics
final and I...

19:17.540 --> 19:19.810
I couldn't remember anything.

19:19.870 --> 19:23.140
- I've never failed a test in my life.
- We're going to fix this.

19:23.150 --> 19:26.550
- How?
- You can retake your finals,

19:26.550 --> 19:28.580
and then you can reapply
to university in the fall.

19:28.650 --> 19:31.480
It wasn't just that
I didn't know the answer.

19:31.490 --> 19:33.990
I didn't understand
the question.

19:36.890 --> 19:39.430
The school is legally
obligated to provide

19:39.490 --> 19:41.560
alternative ways to evaluate
disabled students.

19:41.630 --> 19:44.760
Is that what I am?

19:44.830 --> 19:48.070
We can look it up together.

19:48.140 --> 19:50.270
But you do have a brain injury.

19:52.340 --> 19:55.440
I write everything down now.
I take pictures

19:55.510 --> 19:57.840
and I make audio messages.

19:57.910 --> 20:00.780
Sometimes I get dressed
and I leave the house

20:00.780 --> 20:03.480
and I have no idea
where I'm going.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.950
This isn't conversion disorder.

20:39.690 --> 20:42.060
Hey.

20:46.860 --> 20:48.960
I've been trying to reach you.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.960
I know.

20:51.030 --> 20:53.300
I'm sorry. I've been working
on something today.

20:57.510 --> 21:00.310
Billy said you're off the case.

21:03.050 --> 21:06.050
Let me know

21:06.110 --> 21:08.920
before you disappear again.

21:08.980 --> 21:12.590
I'd like to have a proper
goodbye this time.

21:19.630 --> 21:22.460
You asked me what
happened to me.

21:22.460 --> 21:25.930
Why... why we left so fast.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.030
Yeah.

21:28.100 --> 21:31.740
I might've just found out.

21:31.740 --> 21:35.440
I think I was better off
not knowing.

21:38.350 --> 21:41.550
My dad's sins caught up to him.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.350
That's why we left.

21:44.420 --> 21:47.150
It didn't matter who he hurt,
as long as he got to have

21:47.160 --> 21:50.520
his perfect life.

21:50.590 --> 21:52.560
Do you want to get a drink?

21:52.630 --> 21:55.500
I could really use
a friendly ear,

21:55.500 --> 21:57.400
and from the looks of it,

21:57.400 --> 22:00.730
you could too.

22:02.970 --> 22:05.010
I have to go.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.840
Raincheck?

22:11.850 --> 22:14.350
Another raincheck.

22:36.100 --> 22:39.410
Since I got here, I've been
punched in the face,

22:39.470 --> 22:43.210
had threatening phone calls and
been attacked in my hotel room.

22:43.210 --> 22:45.280
I'm not going anywhere.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.010
So if you have something
to say to me, say it.

22:48.020 --> 22:51.820
Sounds like you're
getting the message.

22:51.890 --> 22:55.760
No. I think there's something else
you've been wanting to tell me.

22:57.830 --> 23:02.030
The truth about Matheson Steel
that's been eating away at you.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.560
[chuckling]

23:04.570 --> 23:06.570
I got nothing to say to you.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.840
Truth's gonna come out.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.910
Maybe you want to be on
the right side when it does.

23:24.650 --> 23:28.090
- That was insane.
- Don't ever do that.

23:28.160 --> 23:32.290
[slow romantic music]

23:39.070 --> 23:41.400
Cheers.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.870
What?

23:46.940 --> 23:50.480
No smartass comment?

23:50.550 --> 23:53.680
You know, if you wanted to
gloat, now would be the time.

23:53.750 --> 23:55.980
We lost the case.

23:56.050 --> 23:59.090
Mill's off the hook. You'll
probably get your job back.

24:01.120 --> 24:04.760
Way I see it, you kinda did me
a favour. Always hated that job,

24:04.760 --> 24:07.030
but never had the stones
to up and quit.

24:07.030 --> 24:09.030
Kid to support and all that.

24:14.970 --> 24:17.000
[laughing softly]

24:17.070 --> 24:20.270
Seems like she's the one
supporting me these days.

24:20.340 --> 24:24.610
Luna's been a big help.

24:24.680 --> 24:28.180
She's smart. She works hard.

24:28.180 --> 24:31.450
Molly's not half bad either.

24:31.450 --> 24:33.450
She's lucky to have you.

24:33.520 --> 24:37.790
Her own dad's a real sack
of crap, as you well know.

24:37.790 --> 24:40.090
Well, if it's true
what they say about girls

24:40.100 --> 24:42.200
marrying their fathers, then
Wendy never stood a chance.

24:42.260 --> 24:45.130
- [laughing]
- Good thing Luna's gay then,

24:45.130 --> 24:47.270
because her dad is...

24:49.970 --> 24:52.670
It's probably none
of my business,

24:52.670 --> 24:55.340
- but how did you and David...
- You're right.

24:55.410 --> 24:58.310
It is none of your business.

25:18.430 --> 25:21.200
Not friends of yours, I take it.

25:24.170 --> 25:25.970
No. You're staying here.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.370
- What? No.
- Anybody could've sent that text.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.510
And that's exactly why
you can't go alone.

25:30.580 --> 25:33.280
No, that's exactly why you're
gonna stay here as lookout.

25:33.350 --> 25:36.420
Anything off, you text me.

25:36.480 --> 25:38.420
Fine.

25:47.730 --> 25:50.700
[suspenseful music]

25:56.270 --> 25:58.440
Hello?

26:01.810 --> 26:05.150
Didn't think you'd actually be
stupid enough to come out here alone.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.950
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

26:16.190 --> 26:18.220
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

26:18.290 --> 26:21.160
When you went to the farm,

26:21.230 --> 26:23.830
I thought to myself,

26:23.830 --> 26:25.830
good, we'll finally
get some justice.

26:25.900 --> 26:28.030
Southvale Farms?

26:28.040 --> 26:30.100
That farm was a dead end.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.110
The animals were a dead end.

26:32.170 --> 26:34.910
You should have been
looking at the son.

26:34.980 --> 26:36.810
Steve Magnus?

26:36.880 --> 26:39.910
He killed himself

26:39.920 --> 26:42.350
'cause he was twitching.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.290
[soft music]

26:56.060 --> 26:59.200
They're buying drinks for the guys who
just signed this town's death warrant.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.340
That's maybe a bit much,
don't you think?

27:02.340 --> 27:03.700
No, I don't.

27:03.770 --> 27:05.670
You honestly think
it's the mill?

27:05.740 --> 27:08.010
I know it is.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.610
OK then.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.650
What are we gonna do about it?

27:12.710 --> 27:16.020
We?

27:16.080 --> 27:19.020
There's not much we can do.

27:19.090 --> 27:21.290
Unless I can get inside
of that doctor's bag.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.320
- What are you talking about?
- Some document

27:25.390 --> 27:28.560
he had Molly sign.

27:32.630 --> 27:35.440
Twitching's only
presented in girls.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.500
If Steve had it,

27:37.510 --> 27:39.840
that destroys the conversion
disorder theory.

27:39.910 --> 27:42.310
I coached him.

27:42.380 --> 27:44.580
He wasn't a bad second baseman.

27:44.650 --> 27:47.580
Always cracked his knuckles
before a game.

27:47.650 --> 27:50.580
I thought it was nerves.

27:50.650 --> 27:53.520
His grandma had Parkinson's.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.990
He watched her lose
control of her body.

27:56.060 --> 27:58.690
He heard it ran in the family.
Scared the hell out of him.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.830
You're saying that
Steve had Parkinson's?

28:00.900 --> 28:03.700
I'm saying it's what he thought.

28:03.770 --> 28:06.800
I noticed he cracked
his knuckles a lot more,

28:06.870 --> 28:10.470
so I asked him what
he was so nervous about.

28:10.540 --> 28:13.840
And he showed me.

28:13.840 --> 28:16.940
He wasn't nervous.
He was twitching.

28:17.010 --> 28:19.680
Made me swear not
to say anything.

28:19.750 --> 28:21.880
But if I'd known...

28:23.950 --> 28:26.750
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not a doctor,

28:26.820 --> 28:28.960
but when the kid tells me
he has Parkinson's,

28:29.020 --> 28:32.430
I believe him.
The symptoms matched.

28:32.490 --> 28:35.930
- But when you saw the girls?
- I knew.

28:38.430 --> 28:41.130
This crap about it
being in their heads,

28:41.200 --> 28:45.040
it's a load of bull. Trust me.

28:51.950 --> 28:55.720
I don't have
conversion disorder.

28:55.780 --> 28:58.520
- Something is wrong with me.
- Who've you been talking to?

28:58.590 --> 29:01.790
Look, maybe you can say that the
tremors are conversion disorder,

29:01.860 --> 29:05.860
but this is more than that.
At church camp, I was the on...

29:05.860 --> 29:07.890
I was the only one

29:07.960 --> 29:10.460
who knew all the lyrics to the
books of the bible song. Remember?

29:12.530 --> 29:15.600
You sang it every day
for a year. I remember.

29:15.670 --> 29:18.910
Well, now I bet
I couldn't even name four.

29:18.970 --> 29:20.940
Something's wrong with me.

29:21.010 --> 29:23.080
Something's really
wrong with me.

29:23.140 --> 29:25.480
Sweetheart, a person's brain

29:25.480 --> 29:27.950
changes more in their
late teens than it does

29:28.020 --> 29:31.820
ever again. It's... growing.

29:31.890 --> 29:34.520
It's not growing,
Dad. It's dying.

29:34.590 --> 29:38.990
I'm not the same person anymore.

29:39.060 --> 29:41.160
Sweetheart...

29:41.230 --> 29:44.830
I know you're hurting,

29:44.900 --> 29:48.770
OK? My little doodlebug.

29:52.910 --> 29:54.840
Someone poisoned me.

29:57.380 --> 30:00.010
I would never do that to you.

30:00.080 --> 30:03.850
Promise me.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.220
Sweetheart, I would
never hurt you.

30:08.290 --> 30:10.260
Or anyone.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.460
I promise.

30:28.540 --> 30:30.740
Peace offering.

30:30.750 --> 30:32.950
I'm good.

30:33.010 --> 30:35.750
Come on.

30:35.820 --> 30:37.950
It's a tradition at CTS.

30:38.020 --> 30:39.990
When a case goes south,
we open a bottle of icewine.

30:40.050 --> 30:42.560
A little sweet with the sour.

30:42.620 --> 30:45.490
- No, thank you.
- Yeah.

30:45.560 --> 30:49.060
Yeah, I don't think the bartender understood
what I meant when I said icewine.

30:50.900 --> 30:54.600
No hard feelings.

30:54.670 --> 30:57.240
You should go back
to your table.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.570
It's just a case,
Crawford. You win some,

30:59.570 --> 31:03.610
- you lose some. That's the game.
- This isn't a game to me.

31:08.220 --> 31:10.720
Never take a case
you care about.

31:10.790 --> 31:13.720
It's a rookie move.

31:17.460 --> 31:20.190
Is it Joanna that's
got you so upset?

31:20.200 --> 31:24.300
'Cause I know she left you high and dry, but
that's just her M.O. Don't take it personally.

31:25.930 --> 31:27.600
[exclamations]

31:31.610 --> 31:34.270
If you knew all this,
why d'you sit on it?

31:34.340 --> 31:36.640
If we'd had this
information sooner...

31:39.010 --> 31:41.280
You were complicit.

31:43.350 --> 31:46.750
I've known Ben Matheson
since we were boys.

31:46.820 --> 31:49.620
You helped bury those barrels
in the field?

31:49.690 --> 31:52.560
The field is just
the tip of the iceberg.

31:52.630 --> 31:54.990
What do you mean?

32:18.750 --> 32:21.350
[phone chiming]

32:23.420 --> 32:25.206
Farrell's here.

32:25.207 --> 32:27.030
If he finds out I'm
talking to you, I'm dead.

32:27.090 --> 32:29.660
- Just give me something I can use.
- Southvale Farms.

32:29.730 --> 32:32.630
- You gotta go back, take a closer look.
- OK.

32:44.550 --> 32:48.310
- Saw your car in the parking lot.
- You following me now?

32:50.280 --> 32:52.290
That's mine.

32:57.360 --> 33:01.160
Little late for you to be out
here all by yourself, isn't it?

33:01.230 --> 33:04.030
It's a free country.

33:04.030 --> 33:06.030
If I see you stalking me again,

33:06.100 --> 33:07.970
I'll file for criminal
harassment.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.000
[chuckling]

33:10.070 --> 33:12.970
Stalking?

33:13.040 --> 33:14.970
You'd like that, wouldn't ya?

33:19.050 --> 33:22.420
You have yourself
a nice night now.

33:33.390 --> 33:35.730
[soft alternative music]

33:41.470 --> 33:44.000
Here you go.

33:48.340 --> 33:51.010
One minute I'm helping you tie
your shoes, and the next...

33:51.010 --> 33:54.680
- You're buying me a drink?
- Fat chance.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.880
- What's up, Ms. Evans?
- We just missed the show.

33:56.890 --> 33:58.880
Your uncle knocked out
the Mill lawyer.

33:58.890 --> 34:00.950
Ha! Well, they didn't call him
"Lights Out" Crawford

34:00.960 --> 34:03.260
for nothing.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.960
I kinda miss that guy.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.800
University letter?

34:09.860 --> 34:12.800
Yeah. It's a no-go.

34:15.170 --> 34:18.139
Guess I'm gonna have
to learn to love this town.

34:20.210 --> 34:22.980
You came back after university
and you're happy.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.980
How?

34:24.980 --> 34:28.510
My ex is moving.
He's got a job in Winnipeg.

34:28.580 --> 34:32.120
Been trying to tell
someone that all day.

34:32.190 --> 34:34.389
I'm sorry.

34:34.460 --> 34:38.020
Our marriage was terrible,

34:38.090 --> 34:41.159
but we're great at co-parenting.
I can count on him.

34:41.230 --> 34:44.730
I could go too, get a job in the
city, but things were just starting

34:44.800 --> 34:48.469
to get serious with Owen. But
then am I just staying for a boy?

34:48.540 --> 34:50.500
[sighing]

34:50.570 --> 34:53.070
I don't know.

34:53.139 --> 34:56.840
- Would you stay for Luna?
- It's more like she's staying for me.

34:58.980 --> 35:01.250
I'm sure you'll meet
someone new in the city.

35:01.320 --> 35:05.080
Maybe. But they
wouldn't be Owen.

35:05.090 --> 35:08.150
- Could you ask him to co-parent?
- He hasn't met my kids yet.

35:08.220 --> 35:10.820
- I pitch co-parenting and he might run.
- Maybe not.

35:10.830 --> 35:12.890
I mean, he's been
Luna's pretend dad

35:12.960 --> 35:15.130
and he's pretty good at it.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.830
Why don't you just tell him
what you want from him?

35:19.900 --> 35:23.800
It doesn't always have to be on
your shoulders to fix everything.

35:23.870 --> 35:26.470
That's what being a partner
means, right?

35:30.380 --> 35:32.010
[laughing]

35:35.980 --> 35:39.020
[mysterious music]

36:19.360 --> 36:23.100
I'm here to bail you out.

36:23.160 --> 36:24.430
No.

36:24.430 --> 36:27.770
- No?
- I don't need you to bail me out, Hanley.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.440
There are plenty of people
in town I can count on.

36:30.440 --> 36:34.640
The barrels in the athletic field are
just the start. There are more of them.

36:34.710 --> 36:37.640
Case was dismissed.
Go back to your life.

36:37.710 --> 36:39.850
Screw that. We appeal.

36:39.850 --> 36:42.180
Or we go wake up the judge
and ask her to reconsider.

36:42.180 --> 36:46.050
- We have them, Billy.
- So there are more barrels.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.050
We still don't have
what we need.

36:48.060 --> 36:50.390
What about a whistleblower?

36:50.460 --> 36:53.760
- On the record.
- Are you serious?

36:55.830 --> 36:57.860
Can I bail you out now?

37:01.670 --> 37:04.470
I punched out your ex-boyfriend.

37:04.540 --> 37:06.470
[laughing]

37:06.470 --> 37:08.740
Why do you think
I'm bailing you out?

37:08.810 --> 37:11.410
Besides, it's Millwood.

37:11.410 --> 37:14.050
Sometimes people
just get punched.

37:26.590 --> 37:29.030
- What's this?
- Molly's non-disclosure agreement.

37:29.030 --> 37:31.700
You caused quite a scene at
the bar. Gave me a chance to...

37:31.770 --> 37:34.000
- Gerrilynn, you're amazing.
- I really am.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.070
I did this for
the girls, not you.

37:39.340 --> 37:42.440
- It's from a publisher.
- Williams is writing a book

37:42.510 --> 37:45.840
on conversion disorder.
He came here looking for it.

37:45.910 --> 37:48.810
- This case could be a gold mine for him.
- So what do we do now?

37:48.820 --> 37:51.320
We expose him.

37:51.390 --> 37:54.190
Who is this "we"
you're talking about?

37:58.160 --> 38:00.390
We know that Steve
and Amanda were dating.

38:00.460 --> 38:03.500
Amanda never set foot on the field
where we found the barrels.

38:03.560 --> 38:06.770
CTS used that as proof
of conversion disorder.

38:06.830 --> 38:10.440
But if Steve was affected too,

38:10.500 --> 38:13.610
then maybe the pond was the place
that they were both exposed.

38:13.670 --> 38:16.140
This is my son
we're talking about.

38:16.210 --> 38:18.210
If what you're saying is true,

38:18.280 --> 38:20.480
then it was my farm
that poisoned him.

38:20.550 --> 38:23.480
This is a case of greed
gone too far.

38:23.550 --> 38:26.120
This will help us
figure out who did this.

38:26.190 --> 38:28.690
And we can make them pay.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.830
It's just up ahead.

upon this court.</i>

40:32.810 --> 40:35.580
And the evidence found
at Southvale Farms

40:35.650 --> 40:37.580
points to a more
widespread cover-up

40:37.650 --> 40:39.620
than we had anticipated.
We have witnesses

40:39.690 --> 40:42.650
who can confirm that Steve
Magnus -who was exposed

40:42.720 --> 40:45.820
to the same toxic poisoning-
was exhibiting the same symptoms

40:45.830 --> 40:48.690
as the girls misdiagnosed
with conversion disorder.

40:48.760 --> 40:51.400
If there are more
dump sites across town,

40:51.470 --> 40:54.500
then every single citizen
of Millwood is at risk.

40:54.570 --> 40:57.100
You can't do that. The ruling
was filed yesterday.

40:57.170 --> 41:00.140
- The case is over.
- You know we'll win on appeal.

41:02.980 --> 41:05.780
This is compelling evidence.

41:05.850 --> 41:08.650
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, I am.

41:08.650 --> 41:12.150
And I understand things
might move a little faster

41:12.220 --> 41:14.190
in Toronto, but
this is Millwood.

41:14.190 --> 41:18.160
And in Millwood, we file
all our motions on Thursdays.

41:18.230 --> 41:21.990
- What day is it today?
- It's Wednesday, Your Honour.

41:22.060 --> 41:24.030
Wednesday. So I still
have the paperwork

41:24.100 --> 41:26.060
for the motion to strike
right here on my desk.

41:26.070 --> 41:28.800
- This is ridiculous.
- You want to see ridiculous, Counselor?

41:28.870 --> 41:30.840
Based on this new information,

41:30.900 --> 41:34.140
I'm reopening the case against Matheson
Steel first thing in the morning.

41:34.210 --> 41:36.710
Thank you, Your Honour.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.320
Hey.

41:44.380 --> 41:46.820
Hey.

41:46.890 --> 41:50.220
Um...

41:50.220 --> 41:53.030
So I don't think
the plans that we made

41:53.090 --> 41:55.030
work for me anymore.

41:59.030 --> 42:02.230
I don't know what the future
holds and that really scares me.

42:02.300 --> 42:04.543
That's no excuse to just
break up with me, Molly...

42:04.544 --> 42:06.370
Let me finish.

42:08.440 --> 42:10.840
The truth is, whatever
is in store for me

42:10.850 --> 42:12.850
isn't gonna be pretty.

42:15.120 --> 42:18.050
Love doesn't just
magically fix everything.

42:18.120 --> 42:21.590
There's gonna be sacrifices and
there's no getting around that.

42:25.060 --> 42:28.060
Everything's changing, Lu.

42:30.660 --> 42:33.870
I can't speak for you,

42:33.930 --> 42:37.000
but I would much rather

42:37.070 --> 42:39.870
face the future together.

42:43.810 --> 42:47.280
You know, if I go
to Montreal without you,

42:47.280 --> 42:50.420
it won't be the life I wanted.

42:54.550 --> 42:57.820
The things that are
easy for other people

42:57.830 --> 43:01.130
- may always be a fight for me.
- I know.

43:04.030 --> 43:06.800
Well, lucky for you,

43:06.870 --> 43:09.100
I come from a long line
of warriors.

43:13.570 --> 43:16.980
I can always dream up new plans.

43:17.040 --> 43:18.980
I can't dream up a new Molly.
