01:23.520 --> 01:26.490
No. Hey, Hazel.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.241
You sleep any better last night?

02:15.640 --> 02:18.500
He says, "How the hell should I know?
It's 200 miles away."

02:18.600 --> 02:19.780
And the wife says,
"What was all that about?"

02:19.880 --> 02:21.086
Then he slams the phone down.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.180
He said, "I don't know. It's just some
jackass asking if the coast was clear."

02:48.840 --> 02:51.844
Hazel? Hazel?

03:00.840 --> 03:02.604
Hey, Hazel.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.449
I don't know what to say.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.049
I guess I should say,

03:24.440 --> 03:26.807
you're going to a better place.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.771
Nothing but doggies.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.928
Oh, maybe you don't want to hear that.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.128
Maybe you just want to wait and see.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.724
I'm gonna just sit here,

03:46.960 --> 03:48.689
as long as they let me.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.500
I'm giving him the sedative now.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.045
He may close his eyes.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.327
Okay. Now he's very relaxed.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.340
I'm going to inject the pentobarbital.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.522
This will stop his heart.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.528
Okay. His heart has stopped.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.124
I'm very sorry.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.644
Take as much time as you need.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.371
Excuse me?

06:28.040 --> 06:29.405
You okay?

06:34.880 --> 06:36.769
You seemed, um...

06:37.600 --> 06:40.060
Oh, what? Are you saying
you thought I was dead?

06:40.160 --> 06:42.380
No, I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

06:42.480 --> 06:44.220
And you're okay.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.288
Well, I'm not okay. I'm terrible.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.481
Okay.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.530
Who are you?

06:50.880 --> 06:53.700
There was always
another guy here. Richie.

06:53.800 --> 06:54.940
Richie moved on.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.900
He had a difference
of opinion with the owners.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.128
So, I'm the new guy.

07:00.080 --> 07:04.005
Okay, clean away, new guy.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.660
You don't look that old, by the way.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.660
I mean, I wasn't worried
because you look old.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.820
Yeah, well, you know you always
got to assume the worst.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.251
Don't worry about it.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.601
Hey.

07:26.080 --> 07:29.402
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.041
Sorry, but can I ask you a favor?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.282
Hey, you see anything?

07:40.880 --> 07:43.042
I do not.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.767
Well, keep looking. Check everywhere.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.700
I just didn't... I didn't see anything.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.165
So maybe he's gone.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.420
Wouldn't you... I just can't imagine
where it came from.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.860
I mean, I've never even seen
a mouse before, but a rat.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.200
A big black rat.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.420
I have to get back to...
I should get back to work.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.682
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I wasn't...

08:10.000 --> 08:11.100
Thank you.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.804
Sure. Lloyd.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.248
Lloyd, I'm Carol.
I'm sorry about before.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.402
Oh, it's...

08:20.520 --> 08:22.841
I'll be outside if the rat comes back.

08:35.679 --> 08:36.659
All set.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.760
Oh.

09:12.320 --> 09:15.540
I suspect this was a black rat
or what we call a roof rat.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.642
Very common in Southern California.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.969
But where do you think it came from?

09:20.080 --> 09:21.060
Oh, they're everywhere.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.420
They live in the trees.
They're all over the city.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.140
I will set a few traps to be sure,

09:25.240 --> 09:28.801
but I think what we have here
is an isolated incident.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.084
Can I help you find something?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.884
Well, I don't know. I'm...

10:01.320 --> 10:04.460
I just wanted to make sure
that I'm getting enough of everything.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.220
Do you have any health issues
you want to address?

10:06.320 --> 10:07.260
No. No.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.180
Okay, well then,
let's just start with some basics.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.060
Um, magnesium, do you take magnesium?

10:12.160 --> 10:13.400
I don't think so.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.211
You don't need all that.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.522
Just right the way you are.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.820
Hey, Rona, did you see
Jerry today at the pool?

11:27.920 --> 11:30.060
- Jerry who?
- There's only the one Jerry.

11:30.160 --> 11:31.380
No, there are three Jerrys.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.131
Jerry Davis, Gerry Phillips,
and Jerry Li.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.340
See?

11:35.440 --> 11:37.340
Gerry Phillips is Gerry
with a G, though.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.420
Does he count?

11:38.520 --> 11:39.500
Do you know who he was with?

11:39.600 --> 11:40.740
Which one?

11:40.840 --> 11:42.700
Jerry Davis, for Christ's sake.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.689
Girls, are we playing cards or what?

11:44.800 --> 11:46.404
- Yeah.
- Look, it's your bid, Georgina.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.940
- One spade.
- Pass.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.820
- One no trump.
- Pass.

11:50.920 --> 11:51.860
Two no trump.

11:51.960 --> 11:52.940
Pass.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.326
Three no trump.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.780
Okay, girls, got to tell you,
I'm feeling good.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.020
You are definitely not winning tonight.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.407
Pass.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.820
Okay, so who the hell was he with?

12:04.920 --> 12:07.366
- Who?
- Jerry Davis.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.100
Oh, right. Jerry was with Karen.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.260
Really?

12:12.360 --> 12:16.220
And I could've sworn she was doing
you-know-what to him in the pool.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.380
- Sally!
- What? No.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.460
Not sex, Georgie.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.300
I think she was just
giving him a little tug.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.740
Language!

12:22.840 --> 12:24.420
- What language?
- Tug.

12:24.520 --> 12:27.340
How is that language? I said "tug."

12:27.440 --> 12:29.363
I didn't say she was "jerking him off."

12:29.680 --> 12:31.780
Oh, and that pool is so disgusting.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.700
There are way
too many people in that pool.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.165
I love that pool.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.820
Carol, when are you gonna move in here?

12:37.920 --> 12:41.129
Susan just passed on.
She was two cottages over.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.660
That reminds me, we got new brochures

12:43.760 --> 12:45.980
and I want you to see the new brochures.

12:46.080 --> 12:47.420
I don't want to see the new brochures.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.700
I saw the old brochures.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.260
Well, I'm bringing them
to your house this week.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.500
Yeah, Carol, you're missing out
on all the action.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.140
You know, I'm happy in my house.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.060
I'm very happy, thank you.

12:57.160 --> 13:00.100
Guys ask about you all the time, Carol.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.580
I could hook you up.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.100
Oh, come on, don't start with that.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.180
What?

13:04.280 --> 13:07.443
Dating talk. The second husband talk.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.486
You couldn't pay me.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.980
But they do pay you, when they die.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.140
Not always.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.300
And who's saying "husband"?

13:14.400 --> 13:15.980
Yeah, maybe you can date somebody.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.420
Yeah, maybe I can
stick a fork in my eye.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.860
Well, it's not like
you dated after Gary died.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.380
When you've had the best,
who cares about the rest?

13:24.480 --> 13:27.051
You see, Rona,
it's not when you had the best,

13:27.160 --> 13:29.140
then you go out and get another one

13:29.240 --> 13:30.860
and then another one,
then another one and...

13:30.960 --> 13:33.780
All right, all right,
I've only been married three times.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.540
- Only three?
- Yeah.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.140
Yeah, well, I'm with Georgina.
I'm not interested.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.460
Uh-uh. No more.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.980
Oh, come on, Carol!
Don't you even think about it?

13:42.080 --> 13:44.208
I mean, just someone to go out
with once in a while.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.606
You know, it's not that simple.

13:45.720 --> 13:46.900
If it were that simple...

13:47.000 --> 13:48.490
What? You mean like you got to put out?

13:48.720 --> 13:50.380
Like the Jerry in the pool.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.300
No, that's not what she means.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.529
I just mean, I don't like my life
all complicated.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.820
I like it just the way it is.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.481
Hazel's gone, but I'm fine.
Really. I'm just fine.

14:11.360 --> 14:12.361
Ooh.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.780
Let's just have the maximum shot
count be 10, for Christ's sake.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.500
Look, the shot count is however
many strokes it takes

14:18.600 --> 14:20.340
to get the ball in the hole.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.841
Golf talk is so sexual-sounding,
isn't it?

14:24.040 --> 14:26.500
Balls, holes, strokes, putts.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.100
Just count up your score, Sally.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.361
And be honest.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.648
- What is this, the PGA?
- Uh-huh.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.564
The Senior-Senior Tour.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.281
I might have won on one of the holes.

14:38.520 --> 14:39.940
One of the holes.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.405
You want a drink?

14:42.200 --> 14:44.043
It's early. I got to drive.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.482
I didn't hear a "no." Excuse me.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.180
I'll have a Bud
and a chardonnay for this one.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.611
Thanks, dear.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.330
Oh, he's handsome.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.220
What?

15:02.320 --> 15:03.401
That guy.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.889
Oh, yeah. I've seen him.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.523
He talked to me
the other day at the store.

15:09.640 --> 15:13.486
Are you kidding me? My God, Carol!

15:13.600 --> 15:15.250
He's so sexy.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.340
He must be new. I'm gonna find out.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.020
Hey, don't you dare.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.360
You sit down.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.180
Look at you like a nervous schoolgirl.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.645
What are you afraid of?

15:26.480 --> 15:27.420
Hey, you know what?

15:27.520 --> 15:30.046
You should come with me tomorrow night
to the speed-dating thing.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.241
Oh, no, no, no.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.700
Oh, come on.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.326
They do it right inside the clubhouse.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.540
You meet some guys, you talk a little.

15:38.640 --> 15:42.167
It's not even dating.
It's just socializing.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.080
No big deal.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.450
Maybe he'll be there.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.410
Oh, thank you.

16:00.680 --> 16:02.489
Okay, thank you.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.420
Like new.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.363
Yeah, well, what was wrong with it?

16:11.760 --> 16:14.820
Well, they tend not to work so well
when they come unplugged.

16:14.920 --> 16:15.921
Oh.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.242
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?

16:37.840 --> 16:39.540
That was a long time ago.

16:39.640 --> 16:40.700
Sorry, I'm nosy.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.801
No, it's fine.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.500
You were a musician?

16:44.600 --> 16:48.500
Yeah, I was in a band
a million years ago

16:48.600 --> 16:50.967
in New York in the Village. I sang.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.646
Is that your husband?

16:52.920 --> 16:54.780
No. That's John.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.247
My husband came later. Bill.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.620
- I was in a band once.
- Yeah, you were?

17:00.720 --> 17:04.020
I sang, too. I mean, if you be...

17:04.119 --> 17:05.804
If you use a very loose
definition of singing,

17:05.920 --> 17:07.523
you can call it singing.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.086
Where was that?

17:09.560 --> 17:12.450
That was in Austin. I just moved back.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.020
What brought you back?

17:14.119 --> 17:16.726
Well, I grew up here in the Valley.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.565
So you have family here?

17:18.680 --> 17:19.727
Yeah.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.411
Yeah, I'm staying with my mom.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.500
I mean, I'm living with her now.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.489
It's a temporary situation.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.005
Hey, you want a drink?

17:29.040 --> 17:32.740
I was just gonna open a bottle,
another bottle.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.020
I...

17:34.120 --> 17:35.300
I'm on the clock.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.820
Oh, come on.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.287
Just pretend to have a drink with me.

17:44.240 --> 17:47.005
You want a little bit
or the full treatment?

17:47.680 --> 17:49.250
Let's try that full treatment.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.321
Yeah.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.900
Cheers, Lloyd.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.001
Cheers.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.647
Mmm.

18:03.680 --> 18:04.780
This is really good.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.260
Yeah, it's a good one.

18:06.360 --> 18:09.443
So, what kind of music do you sing?

18:09.920 --> 18:12.920
The closest I come to singing these days
is karaoke night at the bar.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.660
Yeah, but I started writing some songs.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.580
Yeah? You're a songwriter?

18:18.680 --> 18:19.681
No.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.060
No, I'm definitely not a songwriter,
but I studied poetry in college, so,

18:24.160 --> 18:25.321
it's sort of the same thing.

18:25.440 --> 18:28.700
You went to college
just to write poetry?

18:28.800 --> 18:31.087
Yeah. Hence the pool boy getup.

18:31.880 --> 18:35.444
Well, I guess they're not hiring
many poets these days, huh?

18:35.800 --> 18:37.131
Not currently, no.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.940
Haven't been since I can remember.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.060
Perhaps ever.

18:42.200 --> 18:47.411
But someday I'll have a lot
of poems about pools.

18:51.840 --> 18:56.460
But you were in... I mean,
you were in like an actual band.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.340
Just for a little while.

18:58.440 --> 19:02.411
The photo of that guy you saw,
he played the guitar.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.220
The one that's not your husband?

19:04.320 --> 19:05.780
Yeah, John.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.100
So what happened with your husband?

19:07.200 --> 19:09.009
You get divorced?

19:10.960 --> 19:12.371
He died.

19:15.480 --> 19:19.180
And I think they set it up so that
you have to meet some new people

19:19.280 --> 19:21.089
every couple of minutes. Ugh.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.060
Doesn't that sound awful?

19:23.160 --> 19:25.100
Oh, it's an experience, right?

19:25.200 --> 19:27.407
Oh, yeah, an experience.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.100
- I think it sounds fun.
- Yeah?

19:30.200 --> 19:31.281
Why not?

19:32.720 --> 19:34.404
Yeah, why not?

19:37.320 --> 19:39.620
I have to go meet my mother for dinner.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.580
Oh, okay. I'm sorry I kept you so long.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.887
Are you kidding me? This is great.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.283
You are a good drinking buddy.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.940
That's very sweet of you to say.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.041
I'm not just saying that.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.724
Hey, whatever happened to the rat?

19:55.840 --> 19:59.540
The rat, the rat, he's...
He left, I hope.

19:59.640 --> 20:03.440
The guy said it was
an isolated incident.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.440
Whatever that means.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.925
Do you, um...

20:14.400 --> 20:15.620
I don't know, do you, maybe we...

20:15.720 --> 20:17.131
Do you want to

20:18.160 --> 20:21.323
hang out sometime?
I don't mean like that. I...

20:22.040 --> 20:23.980
Do you want to hang out
like we did here, but we'll just...

20:24.080 --> 20:25.605
We'll go out?

20:25.760 --> 20:28.491
Not go out. Um... This is...

20:29.760 --> 20:31.980
I just... Well, like meant,
I was thinking maybe we could go to

20:32.080 --> 20:33.844
the karaoke place or something and...

20:33.960 --> 20:37.610
I would love to see you get up there
and just knock 'em dead.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.481
Maybe.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.528
Okay. Cool.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.686
Bye.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.362
Oh, that's nice.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.420
There are no men here.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.420
They'll be here. Trust me.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.580
I can't believe I'm doing this.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.364
- Hey, you called me.
- Well, I was drunk.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.006
You know, my decision-making
skills were very low.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.940
Welcome, everyone.
Welcome. Now, settle in.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.940
Come on, settle down.
Everyone find your seat. Find a seat.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.202
All right, everyone sit down. Settle in.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.209
Hello, everyone.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.846
This is going to be really fun.

21:27.520 --> 21:31.051
The boys are waiting back
in that room, and in just a moment,

21:31.160 --> 21:33.527
they're gonna come in
and we're going to begin.

21:33.880 --> 21:36.360
Each date lasts five minutes

21:36.480 --> 21:39.245
and then we move down
the table to the next date.

21:39.360 --> 21:43.300
When I tap the spoon
that's your 30-second warning

21:43.400 --> 21:46.324
that the men are going to shift down
to the next chair.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.404
Now, that's your opportunity
to exchange information,

21:49.520 --> 21:51.409
if that's what you feel like doing.

21:51.880 --> 21:52.927
Are we ready?

21:53.400 --> 21:54.700
Yes!

21:54.800 --> 21:56.848
Oh, come on!
We can't do better than that?

21:57.560 --> 21:59.060
Are you ready?

21:59.160 --> 22:00.400
Yes!

22:00.920 --> 22:02.285
That's a lot better.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.300
So, let the dating begin!

22:05.400 --> 22:07.402
Gentlemen, please come on out.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.220
Good to see you.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.660
Oh. Thank you for coming. Thank you.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.046
I'm glad you could make it.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.340
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.940
Carol.

22:26.040 --> 22:26.980
Yeah. Carol.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.081
Oh, yeah.

22:28.240 --> 22:31.420
I'm Carl. Funny.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.444
Um...

22:35.600 --> 22:37.180
- Is this your first time?
- Yeah.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.770
- Yeah. Same.
- Yes.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.411
Well, I...

22:43.720 --> 22:45.324
I've had girlfriends.

22:45.800 --> 22:49.805
But I am looking for somebody,
you know, special.

22:52.520 --> 22:53.646
But...

22:55.280 --> 22:57.123
What are your interests?

22:57.880 --> 22:59.370
Oh, you...

23:00.280 --> 23:02.020
You mean, what do I like to do?

23:02.120 --> 23:03.281
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.020
Um...

23:06.120 --> 23:09.966
By myself, or with other people?

23:11.040 --> 23:12.405
Either.

23:17.280 --> 23:20.648
How about your interests? What are they?

23:22.480 --> 23:23.980
Um...

23:24.080 --> 23:26.162
Well, right now,

23:28.120 --> 23:29.929
I guess my interest is you.

23:30.320 --> 23:33.005
Right. Yeah.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.820
Well...

23:37.440 --> 23:39.681
Thirty seconds to shift.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.484
Oh, boy. Thirty seconds to shift.

23:50.640 --> 23:51.846
All right.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.780
Nice to meet you, Carol.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.325
You, too. You, too.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.540
Shift!

23:58.640 --> 24:00.051
That's right. Shift down.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.521
Everyone just move to the next table.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.040
Yes, right there.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.060
This is great.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.049
Five minutes starts now.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.121
I'm gonna cut to the chase here,
if that's okay?

24:14.440 --> 24:15.420
Okay.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.682
Sex is still very important to me.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.201
Oh.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.980
No one told me you have
to carry a sweater around

24:23.080 --> 24:24.780
with you at all times in California.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.964
The most important thing
is that you're around all the time.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.220
You know Barry Manilow is coming to town

24:31.320 --> 24:33.846
and who doesn't love Barry Manilow?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.340
What am I afraid of, herpes?

24:36.440 --> 24:38.300
So I have herpes for a few years
and then what,

24:38.400 --> 24:39.925
I'm dead anyway, you know.

24:40.040 --> 24:43.563
I mean, I don't have herpes,
but it's okay with me if you do.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.060
The last woman I dated was never there.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.731
She was always playing
bridge or at the movies

24:48.880 --> 24:50.980
or having coffee with friends.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.764
The AC is out of control.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.460
I mean, what are they trying to do?

24:54.560 --> 24:55.980
Refrigerate us?

24:56.080 --> 24:58.651
I like having you there next to me.

24:58.840 --> 25:01.407
If we were to go out, I'd like to get
right to it, if you know what I mean.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.171
We don't have much time left.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.963
Let's just have some fun, huh?

25:10.440 --> 25:12.169
So that wasn't so bad, right?

25:12.280 --> 25:13.770
Not so bad?

25:13.880 --> 25:15.900
I live a long healthy life for that?

25:16.000 --> 25:17.300
What the hell was I doing in there?

25:17.400 --> 25:18.340
Oh, lighten up.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.340
Oh, yeah, did you talk
to the herpes guy?

25:20.440 --> 25:21.660
One of them had herpes?

25:21.760 --> 25:24.500
No, he didn't care if I did.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.170
This is nuts.

25:36.080 --> 25:37.081
You?

25:37.720 --> 25:39.882
I want to have lunch with you.
What's your name?

25:41.280 --> 25:42.300
Yes.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.447
Your name is Yes?

25:44.040 --> 25:45.769
Yes, I'll go to lunch with you.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.366
Just like that?

25:48.120 --> 25:49.884
How else would you like it to be?

25:50.120 --> 25:52.122
- When?
- Now.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.962
- Now?
- I'm hungry.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.962
Just give me your phone number
and I'll call you.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.380
Ask you out properly.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.060
Oh, you're on your way
to a date right now. Is that it?

26:03.160 --> 26:05.162
Just give me your number.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.800
You have a pen and paper?

26:08.160 --> 26:10.322
We seem to be in a real bind here.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.006
I'll remember your number.

26:14.080 --> 26:16.560
818-754-8737.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.163
All right, I'll call you.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.925
But who am I calling?

26:23.800 --> 26:24.847
Carol.

26:25.320 --> 26:28.085
Carol. I'm Bill.

26:49.200 --> 26:52.522
Oh. Hi, hi. I'm looking for Lloyd?

26:55.280 --> 26:56.260
Oh.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.601
Well, can I leave him a message?

27:09.120 --> 27:10.121
Hello?

27:10.360 --> 27:12.727
Hey, Carol, it's Lloyd.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.100
I got your message.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.940
Is everything okay with the pool sweep?

27:16.040 --> 27:20.090
Yes, Lloyd. Lloyd, uh,

27:20.400 --> 27:24.041
is there any karaoke around tonight?

27:25.800 --> 27:28.804
I'm sure there is, somewhere.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.407
Oh, that'd be so great.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.401
Um...

27:34.240 --> 27:35.571
Hello?

27:35.840 --> 27:37.763
Sorry, I'm thinking. I, um...

27:38.920 --> 27:41.161
And I could definitely find a place.

27:41.480 --> 27:45.166
Oh, good. So, you'll pick me up?

27:55.760 --> 27:56.900
How you guys doing?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.161
Hey.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.771
What can I get you?

28:04.760 --> 28:05.740
Oh, I don't know.

28:05.840 --> 28:08.286
Well, I'll have whatever you're having.

28:08.680 --> 28:09.780
Two Modelos.

28:09.880 --> 28:10.927
Got it. All right.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.449
Have you ever been here before?

28:19.600 --> 28:22.444
Yeah, a few times. I like it.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.620
Here you are. And here you go.
Enjoy them.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.290
Great, thank you.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.962
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.371
Oh, that's good.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.964
It's good to be out.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.762
You had a rough day at the office?

28:41.320 --> 28:43.402
Not exactly that, but...

28:50.640 --> 28:52.060
Guess we're here a little early.

28:52.160 --> 28:56.006
Yeah. Shouldn't this be happy hour?

28:56.400 --> 28:57.620
Oh, no, no.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.460
Nowadays people
don't go out until pretty late.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.300
- Really? How late?
- Yeah.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.460
- 10:00 or 11:00.
- 10:00 or 11:00. Geez.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.300
Even on a weeknight, huh?

29:05.400 --> 29:06.447
Yeah.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.445
Don't they have jobs?

29:11.920 --> 29:13.490
Not so much anymore.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.682
And here we go.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.127
Wow. Looks good.

29:31.680 --> 29:32.681
Mmm.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.049
Wow. What did you make me?

29:35.320 --> 29:37.687
That is called an appletini.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.768
Appletini? Appletini.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.689
Well, I got to write that down.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.887
Mmm. Don't want to forget that.

29:46.440 --> 29:47.521
Good.

29:48.280 --> 29:49.420
You ever have one?

29:49.520 --> 29:52.000
An appletini? No. No, I haven't.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.168
Okay, so...

29:57.320 --> 29:58.740
Oh, I got one.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.366
- What is it?
- Yeah. I'm not telling you.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.780
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I can do this one. Ready?

30:06.880 --> 30:08.041
Yeah, I'm ready.
I know what I'm gonna do.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.140
Already?

30:09.240 --> 30:11.402
Yeah. Oh, yeah,
I do the same one every time.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.646
I think we're alone now.

30:15.080 --> 30:18.402
Doesn't seem to be anyone around

30:19.360 --> 30:21.681
I think we're alone now.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.927
The beating of our hearts
is the only sound.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.003
Break it down for the organ break.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.565
Running just as fast as we can.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.607
Holding on to one another's hands.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.085
Hands, hands.

30:48.240 --> 30:51.244
Trying to get away into the night.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.129
And you put your arms around me.

30:53.240 --> 30:54.765
And we tumble to the ground.

30:54.880 --> 30:58.282
And then you say,
I think we're alone now.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.767
The beating of our hearts
is the only sound.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.120
Thank you.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.380
That was very good.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.561
Thank you.

31:12.640 --> 31:16.122
It looks like the 10:00 crowd
is filtering in now.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.890
God, it's about time.

31:18.280 --> 31:20.860
Hey, you good? Did you sign up?

31:20.960 --> 31:22.644
Yeah. Yeah.

31:50.280 --> 31:54.490
Now, you say.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.683
You're lonely.

31:58.320 --> 32:02.769
You cried the long night through.

32:04.600 --> 32:09.481
Well, you can cry me a river.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.761
Cry me a river

32:14.440 --> 32:18.286
I cried a river over you.

32:21.040 --> 32:25.204
And now you say.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.448
You're sorry.

32:29.800 --> 32:34.806
For being so untrue.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.963
Well, you can.

32:37.200 --> 32:40.647
Cry me a river.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.730
Cry me a river

32:45.200 --> 32:49.046
I've cried a river over you.

32:53.240 --> 32:56.847
You drove me, nearly drove me.

32:57.040 --> 32:59.884
Out of my head.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.721
While you never.

33:02.880 --> 33:06.521
Shed a tear.

33:07.360 --> 33:11.251
Yeah. Remember, I remember.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.241
All that you said.

33:15.840 --> 33:19.162
Told me love was too plebian.

33:19.360 --> 33:22.682
You told me you were through with me.

33:22.920 --> 33:26.606
And now.

33:26.760 --> 33:30.207
You say you love me.

33:31.600 --> 33:35.844
Well, just to prove that it is true.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.126
Come on, come on and.

33:39.280 --> 33:42.363
Cry me a river.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.521
Cry me a river.

33:47.080 --> 33:51.940
'Cause I've cried a river over you.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.121
Thank you.

34:01.160 --> 34:02.321
Thank you.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.246
That was incredible. I have goose bumps.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.246
Okay. Can we go now?

34:11.360 --> 34:12.340
Already?

34:12.440 --> 34:14.260
Yeah, I'd like to quit while I'm ahead.

34:14.360 --> 34:15.360
Oh...

34:15.560 --> 34:17.562
I'd definitely say you're ahead.

34:19.800 --> 34:20.960
Wow.

34:23.080 --> 34:25.060
I really needed that. God, that was...

34:25.159 --> 34:27.447
I was scared at first,
but it was really fun.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.324
Why did you stop singing?

34:33.719 --> 34:35.085
I don't remember.

34:36.239 --> 34:40.969
I woke up one morning
and I wasn't singing anymore.

34:42.360 --> 34:43.964
Hey, do you want some coffee?

34:45.520 --> 34:46.521
What?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.139
Oh, come on.

34:48.239 --> 34:49.844
Really, I am really making coffee.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.739
Don't be an asshole.

34:51.840 --> 34:52.966
Okay.

34:55.320 --> 34:57.340
This is a really nice turntable.

34:57.440 --> 35:00.603
Yeah, Bill was very picky
about his stereo stuff.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.723
Aha, the old...

35:07.040 --> 35:09.361
What kind of plans do you have, Lloyd?

35:12.040 --> 35:17.100
Uh, I'm not really in
like a plan-making place.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.140
No?

35:18.240 --> 35:19.241
No.

35:20.520 --> 35:23.524
I'm more just trying to
sock some money away.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.370
How did you earn your money?

35:27.640 --> 35:28.880
I was a teacher.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.201
Huh.

35:32.720 --> 35:33.900
What did you teach?

35:34.000 --> 35:38.881
Well, I taught reading,
which I really loved.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.940
And then I taught the classes
that nobody else wanted,

35:43.040 --> 35:44.724
like health and typing.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.740
And so you earned your money
and that's what you retired on?

35:48.840 --> 35:52.925
No. On Bill's life insurance.
I retired right after he died.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.900
He died pretty young?

35:57.000 --> 35:59.401
Yeah. A plane crash.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.569
It was a really big
news story back then.

36:01.680 --> 36:04.081
It went on for a long time after.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.531
A lot of people died.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.370
He was on a business trip.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.206
How long ago was that?

36:12.600 --> 36:14.602
Twenty years ago this spring.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.931
It's, I mean, that's...
Stories like that,

36:18.040 --> 36:19.500
that just make you want
to live in the moment.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.011
Screw the job.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.683
Can't have it both ways, huh?

36:25.400 --> 36:26.845
I guess not.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.521
You don't get it because you're young.

36:29.760 --> 36:32.127
You're looking forward to everything.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.487
Um...

36:34.040 --> 36:36.771
I don't think I'm looking
forward to anything.

36:37.880 --> 36:41.362
I mean, I moved back really
to be with my mom.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.281
She's been having
some health issues and...

36:44.440 --> 36:48.286
I don't know, I mean,
nothing serious, but you know.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.082
My dad died a few years back.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.327
I don't even think she enjoys
having me around, to be honest.

36:57.720 --> 37:00.644
I'm just trying to be responsible.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.410
Do the right thing.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.762
You're doing the right thing, Lloyd.

37:05.880 --> 37:08.140
And just know

37:08.240 --> 37:10.811
that no matter what you do,
it's all gonna just

37:11.920 --> 37:13.888
run together by the time you're 50.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.321
Yeah?

37:16.440 --> 37:18.920
Yeah, I mean, time just goes by quicker.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.820
I don't know,

37:20.920 --> 37:25.380
maybe if my daughter had married
and I'd had some grandchildren,

37:25.480 --> 37:28.484
that might have slowed things down
a little here and there.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.980
I mean, people talk about
living in the moment,

37:32.080 --> 37:33.764
like it's some kind of a goal.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.689
What does that even mean?

37:36.760 --> 37:38.762
You know, I think it means...

37:40.360 --> 37:42.420
You know, like, not being weighed down

37:42.520 --> 37:44.420
by what you think you should be doing.

37:44.520 --> 37:47.500
Oh, come on, that's impossible.
There's no such thing as that.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.260
I mean, didn't you feel it

37:50.360 --> 37:52.580
when you were up on stage singing?

37:52.680 --> 37:54.523
- Feel what?
- Like that was it.

37:55.760 --> 37:59.890
Like, while you were singing,
that was all that existed.

38:00.760 --> 38:02.046
Like that...

38:02.160 --> 38:04.500
Like all your worries just disappear.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.729
People can spend their
whole lives doing that.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.340
Waiting to find that feeling.

38:09.440 --> 38:12.444
Trying to find that feeling
over and over.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.847
And in the end, everybody gets it.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.203
We wait our whole lives
for something and we get it.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.564
And you know what that is?

38:21.560 --> 38:22.891
Happiness?

38:24.360 --> 38:25.805
It's death.

38:37.400 --> 38:41.166
Yeah, I get it. I'm gonna get it.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.483
I'm not very good at jokes. Sorry.

38:43.720 --> 38:44.980
That was a joke?

38:45.080 --> 38:47.082
Yeah, you're not very good at jokes.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.283
Oh, God.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.363
Hey, rise and shine.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.460
Hey. You fell asleep

39:11.560 --> 39:13.340
and I didn't know what to do with you,

39:13.440 --> 39:16.091
so I just let you stay there.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.206
Yeah.

39:19.560 --> 39:23.048
Well, I'll make you some coffee
and then you should go.

39:23.280 --> 39:26.443
Okay, 'cause I got to start my day here.

39:27.360 --> 39:28.521
Okay.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.006
Oh, boy.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.723
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:10.160 --> 40:13.220
Oh, hi. Hi. What are you doing here?

40:13.320 --> 40:16.802
Uh, brought the brochures.
They have floor plans now.

40:17.240 --> 40:20.164
Okay, good. You want a cup of tea?

40:20.480 --> 40:21.606
Sure.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.611
Thank you.

40:33.840 --> 40:37.322
Okay, so, who's the guy?

40:38.360 --> 40:39.691
What guy?

40:40.440 --> 40:44.483
The young guy with the bed head
that I just ran into outside?

40:44.600 --> 40:47.206
Oh, my God, you are such a snoop.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.500
I am not a snoop.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.780
I brought these over and I see a guy

40:50.880 --> 40:52.180
leaving your house
at 8:00 in the morning.

40:52.280 --> 40:55.727
And I'm just wondering,
of course, what's going on.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.846
Mmm. Right. It's none of your business.

41:00.960 --> 41:03.281
I think I know what's going on.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.460
Are you some kind of cougar?

41:05.560 --> 41:07.780
Yeah, right. That's me.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.780
You're a cougar and I'm proud of you.

41:10.880 --> 41:11.940
Will you get out of here?

41:12.040 --> 41:15.380
But don't let him videotape you,
'cause it will be all over the Internet.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.891
You should know.

41:18.480 --> 41:19.527
Mmm-hmm.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.247
You have two new messages.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.245
Hey, Mom, it's Kath.

41:32.560 --> 41:35.460
I got some frequent flyer miles,
so I bought a ticket to L.A.

41:35.560 --> 41:39.323
I haven't been down there in a while,
so I just figured I'd book it.

41:39.520 --> 41:42.140
I'll be in next Tuesday.
I hope that's okay.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.004
I'll call you later. Love you.

41:44.520 --> 41:45.851
Next message.

41:46.560 --> 41:48.847
I'm talking to a machine here, I guess.

41:49.720 --> 41:51.722
But the machine said this was Carol.

41:52.440 --> 41:55.205
So, Carol, this is Bill.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.930
I remembered your number,
so I thought I'd give you a call.

41:59.480 --> 42:00.740
If you're not busy today,

42:00.840 --> 42:03.491
why don't you come down
to the clubhouse around 11:00?

42:03.920 --> 42:06.207
I'll be on the patio waiting for you.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.966
If not, hey, no big deal.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.884
End of messages.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.289
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi.

42:31.480 --> 42:32.641
Glad you came.

42:33.800 --> 42:35.245
- Can I get you anything?
- Oh...

42:35.960 --> 42:37.883
No. No, thank you. I...

42:38.040 --> 42:40.008
You know, I didn't know
how to dress or...

42:40.160 --> 42:42.811
I wasn't sure if I should
bring my golf clubs or...

42:43.200 --> 42:45.521
You're dressed just right.
I don't play golf.

42:45.800 --> 42:48.220
You live on a golf course
and you don't play golf?

42:48.320 --> 42:50.163
Yeah, it's just not my game.

42:51.040 --> 42:52.724
Never had the patience.

42:54.240 --> 42:56.242
We're gonna do something else today.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.729
My car's out front. You ready?

42:59.480 --> 43:00.845
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

43:01.000 --> 43:02.001
Yeah.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.260
Where are you taking me?

43:04.360 --> 43:05.725
You'll see.

43:36.120 --> 43:37.645
"So what?"

43:37.760 --> 43:39.046
Miles Davis.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.201
Oh.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.051
Kind of Blue.

43:42.440 --> 43:43.726
You know your stuff.

43:44.240 --> 43:45.924
You don't get seasick, do you?

44:09.560 --> 44:11.085
You ever fish?

44:11.360 --> 44:12.566
Not really.

44:12.760 --> 44:14.125
It's easy.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.562
You just throw in a line and wait.

44:20.480 --> 44:21.925
That's it, huh?

44:24.440 --> 44:26.329
We're not gonna try too hard.

44:27.080 --> 44:29.765
We're just gonna sit out here
and enjoy the day.

44:31.760 --> 44:33.842
Hey, you ever gonna light that thing?

44:34.440 --> 44:36.442
I used to light them all the time.

44:38.240 --> 44:41.449
Trying to be more health
conscious in my later years.

44:42.280 --> 44:43.260
Oh, yeah?

44:43.360 --> 44:44.361
Yeah.

44:46.000 --> 44:51.131
And someone once told me
that I had a oral fixation. So...

44:52.800 --> 44:55.121
So, you do this for all the girls?

44:55.280 --> 44:56.805
I don't do this for anyone.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.888
You're the first one out on my boat.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.020
Really?

45:02.120 --> 45:03.804
You think I'd lie?

45:04.280 --> 45:05.620
I have no idea.

45:05.720 --> 45:08.521
I mean, I'm being very trusting
with somebody I don't know.

45:08.640 --> 45:13.220
For all I know, you could be a murderer
and you brought me out here to kill me

45:13.320 --> 45:17.170
and dump me in the ocean,
like The Sopranos.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.020
You watch that show?

45:19.120 --> 45:20.326
Every episode.

45:21.320 --> 45:23.004
That was a great show.

45:26.040 --> 45:27.963
No, I just bought this boat.

45:28.640 --> 45:31.641
I took one look at my retirement
and I said, "Screw it.

45:31.800 --> 45:34.201
"I'm moving to California
and I want a boat."

45:34.480 --> 45:36.050
And where were you living?

45:36.200 --> 45:38.089
I was in Dallas at the time.

45:39.480 --> 45:41.323
I've lived in a lot of places.

45:43.520 --> 45:47.842
I don't have any kids,
no family, no one to leave it to.

45:49.160 --> 45:50.844
I just decided,

45:52.040 --> 45:54.361
I want to spend it all before I go.

45:55.200 --> 45:56.740
How's that going for you?

45:56.840 --> 45:58.330
So far so good.

46:01.360 --> 46:03.500
You know, people that retire
with all their money,

46:03.600 --> 46:06.180
it's like they don't know
what to do with themselves.

46:06.280 --> 46:07.441
They just sit.

46:08.280 --> 46:09.770
You know, watch TV.

46:11.200 --> 46:12.531
Play golf.

46:14.680 --> 46:17.365
You know, they go out
and eat cheap dinners.

46:18.520 --> 46:20.682
Go to the movies, the casinos.

46:21.280 --> 46:23.282
I didn't want to end up like that.

46:23.680 --> 46:26.180
So what are you doing
living with all those people

46:26.280 --> 46:28.601
at the retirement community?

46:29.520 --> 46:31.045
I'm a social guy.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.604
I don't like being alone.

46:41.720 --> 46:43.210
But I like this, too.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.130
I like being out here

46:46.880 --> 46:48.564
away from all the noise.

47:35.760 --> 47:37.603
When did your husband pass away?

47:37.920 --> 47:39.445
1994.

47:42.360 --> 47:43.805
You still seem kind of,

47:45.280 --> 47:46.860
I don't know, mournful to me.

47:46.960 --> 47:47.940
Do I?

47:48.040 --> 47:49.041
Yeah.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.531
There's like a...

47:53.960 --> 47:56.167
I don't know, you seem kind of pissed.

47:56.320 --> 47:57.765
- Pissed?
- Yeah.

47:59.160 --> 48:02.448
But in a sad sort of way,
if that makes any sense.

48:04.040 --> 48:05.804
Well, my dog died.

48:06.760 --> 48:08.922
I had to put him down last week.

48:09.840 --> 48:12.002
That must have been sad for you.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.900
That'd piss me off.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.445
I'm very sorry.

48:20.200 --> 48:22.168
Well, I've been feeling,

48:23.600 --> 48:25.204
I don't know, numb.

48:25.880 --> 48:30.727
You know, I feel like
I should be more sad.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.300
He meant the world to me.

48:35.400 --> 48:36.401
But...

48:37.320 --> 48:40.449
I don't know, I just...
I can't put my finger on it.

48:41.240 --> 48:42.651
Yeah.

48:43.920 --> 48:45.410
It's bittersweet.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.442
You don't want them to suffer.

48:50.400 --> 48:51.970
But you can't let them go.

48:55.320 --> 48:57.460
It's hard to lose somebody.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.722
No matter how many legs they have.

49:04.200 --> 49:05.565
Just leaves a big hole.

49:07.040 --> 49:08.166
Yeah.

49:09.200 --> 49:10.260
How old was he?

49:10.360 --> 49:11.600
Fourteen.

49:12.600 --> 49:15.570
Wow. You've been through a lot together.

49:15.680 --> 49:19.446
Yeah. You think he saw it that way?

49:23.520 --> 49:25.488
Did you ever lose anybody?

49:26.040 --> 49:27.280
A wife or...

49:29.120 --> 49:30.884
My wife left me.

49:31.720 --> 49:33.085
Then she died.

49:33.960 --> 49:35.769
Boy, that would piss me off.

49:37.200 --> 49:40.363
Could have been worse.
Could have been me.

49:49.200 --> 49:51.168
I like you a little bit, I think.

49:53.400 --> 49:54.561
Yeah.

49:55.840 --> 49:57.365
You're okay.

50:09.520 --> 50:13.320
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

50:13.840 --> 50:16.411
Day, I should say.

50:16.960 --> 50:19.540
Yeah, I... God, I don't even remember
the last time I spent

50:19.640 --> 50:21.847
a whole day away from my house.

50:22.680 --> 50:24.489
I had a great time.

50:24.920 --> 50:27.161
Good. I'm glad.

50:29.720 --> 50:31.722
- So...
- Where you going?

50:33.080 --> 50:35.970
Home. Isn't that where I am?

50:56.160 --> 50:57.525
Okay.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.964
Thank you.

51:02.640 --> 51:04.483
Can I see you again?

51:48.200 --> 51:50.020
You didn't hear anything
in the walls last night?

51:50.120 --> 51:52.327
Well, I didn't sleep here last night.

51:53.440 --> 51:55.620
I don't see anything.
I don't hear anything.

51:55.720 --> 51:58.041
He might be in the walls, but...

51:59.280 --> 52:01.260
I'll set a few more traps
outside by your plumbing.

52:01.360 --> 52:03.044
Okay. Good.

52:04.320 --> 52:05.660
Oh, I'm getting another beer.

52:05.760 --> 52:06.886
Anyone want a refill?

52:07.200 --> 52:09.140
Maybe I'll split a beer with somebody.

52:09.240 --> 52:10.540
I'm not splitting a beer with you.

52:10.640 --> 52:11.660
Why not?

52:11.760 --> 52:13.900
Last time, you got your
lipstick all over the can

52:14.000 --> 52:15.700
and you only had one freaking sip.

52:15.800 --> 52:17.020
You want a whole one or not?

52:17.120 --> 52:18.740
I don't know.

52:18.840 --> 52:21.446
Maybe you can pour me
a little in a glass?

52:21.920 --> 52:23.649
Carol, do you want a refill?

52:25.440 --> 52:26.726
- Carol.
- What?

52:26.920 --> 52:28.700
You haven't said a word all night.

52:28.800 --> 52:30.340
I'm just thinking.

52:30.440 --> 52:32.204
- About what?
- I know.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.860
You don't know, Ro.

52:35.960 --> 52:37.220
What does she know?

52:37.320 --> 52:39.820
Is there something you'd like
to share with the group, Carol?

52:39.920 --> 52:41.220
Anything you want to tell us?

52:41.320 --> 52:43.300
No. There's nothing to share.

52:43.400 --> 52:44.620
Okay, be like that.

52:44.720 --> 52:46.020
Yeah, let's just play the game.

52:46.120 --> 52:47.485
Come on, Rona.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.726
What?

52:49.200 --> 52:50.740
Carol, you want a refill?

52:50.840 --> 52:52.410
- Yeah, I do.
- All right.

52:52.640 --> 52:57.645
Hey, actually, do you still have
any of that medical marijuana?

52:58.680 --> 52:59.806
Yeah.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.260
I haven't smoked since the '70s.

53:05.360 --> 53:07.100
How the heck does this thing work?

53:07.200 --> 53:08.500
It's got to warm up.

53:08.600 --> 53:10.682
It's like pre-heating an oven.

53:11.440 --> 53:12.700
Have you smoked recently?

53:12.800 --> 53:14.768
I can't even remember
the last time I smoked.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.380
Why am I so nervous?

53:16.480 --> 53:19.370
My heart's beating really fast.

53:19.520 --> 53:21.500
Why? You're not gonna OD.

53:21.600 --> 53:22.980
Okay. Try it now.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.820
But pull slow.
This thing will mess you up.

53:24.920 --> 53:26.140
I know what I'm doing.

53:26.240 --> 53:29.210
All right, all right,
let's get this going.

53:31.520 --> 53:33.780
Where's the smoke?
I don't see any smoke.

53:33.880 --> 53:35.120
It's vapor.

53:40.880 --> 53:44.380
Oh, man, oh, jeez. That's great.

53:47.080 --> 53:48.660
Carol, you ready?

53:48.760 --> 53:50.330
Me, me, me, me.

53:52.800 --> 53:54.660
I don't know if I'm gonna do this.

53:54.760 --> 53:55.921
I don't know.

54:10.160 --> 54:13.767
There it is again. Did you hear that?

54:14.040 --> 54:15.769
I didn't hear anything.

54:16.880 --> 54:17.940
Really?

54:18.040 --> 54:19.201
Me neither.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.888
You both need hearing aids.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.531
Where's Carol?

54:24.880 --> 54:25.900
In the kitchen.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.740
Same place she was
two minutes ago when you asked.

54:28.840 --> 54:31.650
I knew I shouldn't have
smoked this stuff.

54:32.080 --> 54:35.721
You've turned me into an advanced
Alzheimer's patient.

54:36.360 --> 54:40.081
Just try to relax, Georgie.
It'll wear off. Yeah.

54:41.480 --> 54:42.970
I'm feeling pretty good.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.004
There it is again.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.685
Well, what the hell is it?

54:51.240 --> 54:52.651
Like a dog barking.

54:53.160 --> 54:54.700
What kind of dog?

54:54.800 --> 54:59.283
Like a little dog.
Like a little teeny dog.

55:00.440 --> 55:01.460
Really?

55:01.560 --> 55:02.766
Yip.

55:03.480 --> 55:04.620
Yep?

55:04.720 --> 55:05.881
Yip.

55:21.240 --> 55:22.890
- Got the munchies?
- Mmm.

55:23.640 --> 55:25.847
I'm just looking around.

55:26.320 --> 55:30.041
This ceramic owl,
it's really staring me down.

55:30.320 --> 55:31.340
We found it!

55:32.520 --> 55:33.726
What?

55:35.160 --> 55:37.860
It was Sally's smoke detector.

55:37.960 --> 55:40.220
What the hell did you do to that thing?

55:40.320 --> 55:42.049
It was yipping like a dog.

55:42.560 --> 55:43.940
Dead battery.

55:44.040 --> 55:46.168
Well, what am I supposed
to do with this?

55:48.040 --> 55:50.088
Is there anything to eat?

56:00.000 --> 56:01.411
You guys having a party?

56:05.160 --> 56:06.241
No.

56:08.680 --> 56:10.409
Oh, my God, this is good.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.180
You can eat that?

56:12.280 --> 56:13.460
We're eating mothballs.

56:13.560 --> 56:14.607
Mothballs.

56:14.880 --> 56:16.700
They're really good for your gums.

56:23.560 --> 56:24.540
Wait, what is that?

56:24.640 --> 56:26.300
There's a cop car back there.

56:26.400 --> 56:28.100
- What? Why?
- He turned away.

56:28.200 --> 56:30.020
- That was a cop car?
- Yeah.

56:30.120 --> 56:33.180
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
what the hell did we do?

56:33.280 --> 56:34.645
Did we do something?

56:35.920 --> 56:38.048
All right, we have done nothing, right?

56:38.600 --> 56:39.806
Sober up.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.001
Ladies.

56:43.640 --> 56:44.926
What's going on here?

56:46.600 --> 56:48.204
We've been shopping.

56:49.760 --> 56:51.460
I can see that.

56:51.560 --> 56:53.244
What are you doing in the street?

56:54.200 --> 56:58.540
Well, there are no sidewalks,
so how else are we gonna get home?

56:58.640 --> 57:02.326
This neighborhood isn't very
pedestrian-friendly, officer.

57:02.480 --> 57:06.121
You can't arrest people
for walking, can you?

57:06.240 --> 57:07.924
No, I don't think so.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.444
What about the shopping cart?

57:13.440 --> 57:14.680
What about it?

57:15.320 --> 57:16.780
You guys plan on returning that?

57:16.880 --> 57:18.723
You know, technically that's theft.

57:23.160 --> 57:27.848
Alphonse said that we could
borrow this thing.

57:28.960 --> 57:30.610
- Oh, Alphonse said.
- Yeah.

57:30.840 --> 57:31.921
Who's Alphonse?

57:34.040 --> 57:37.100
He is the manager. Alphonse.

57:37.200 --> 57:38.220
Yeah.

57:38.320 --> 57:39.940
He said that to us personally.

57:40.040 --> 57:42.008
We're just a bunch of old ladies.

57:42.840 --> 57:45.684
We are turning right up the road

57:46.280 --> 57:48.282
to our place where we live.

57:48.400 --> 57:52.883
The Royal Oaks Village
Retirement Village.

58:01.080 --> 58:04.163
Sir, we are making...

58:06.920 --> 58:10.003
She's just silly tonight.

58:13.440 --> 58:15.966
Okay, look. Just stay safe.

58:18.480 --> 58:20.244
All right? Stay out of the road.

58:20.880 --> 58:22.020
Yeah?

58:22.120 --> 58:23.246
Yes, sir. Aye aye, sir.

58:23.360 --> 58:24.860
Thank you, officer.

58:24.960 --> 58:25.940
Uh-huh.

58:26.040 --> 58:26.980
Good-bye, officer.

58:27.080 --> 58:28.100
Thank you very, very, very much, sir.

58:28.200 --> 58:29.201
Good night.

58:31.200 --> 58:33.009
Shh! Shh! Shh! Don't!

58:37.200 --> 58:38.884
- Bye.
- Bye!

58:41.480 --> 58:42.580
Are you kidding me?

58:42.680 --> 58:43.740
Oh, my God!

58:43.840 --> 58:45.420
- I thought I was gonna choke.
- Did you hear...

58:45.520 --> 58:47.940
Alphonse? What's?

58:48.040 --> 58:50.060
Alphonse? Who's Alphonse?

58:50.160 --> 58:51.140
I made it up.

58:51.240 --> 58:52.969
He was cute.

58:53.840 --> 58:56.605
I didn't know they had
cute policemen like that.

59:10.760 --> 59:13.843
You have three new messages.

59:14.160 --> 59:18.609
Hello, Carol, this is Bill.
I'm just calling to say hello.

59:18.800 --> 59:20.460
I'd like to see you again.

59:20.560 --> 59:22.927
If you're not busy this week,
give me a call.

59:23.120 --> 59:24.770
Next message.

59:25.040 --> 59:27.660
Hey, Mom, it's Kath.
I didn't hear from you, so,

59:27.760 --> 59:30.286
just making sure it's okay
that I'm coming Tuesday.

59:30.560 --> 59:33.166
Give me a call when you get
a chance, okay? Love you.

59:33.680 --> 59:35.284
Next message.

59:35.520 --> 59:38.140
Listen. How about tomorrow night?

59:38.240 --> 59:39.810
Let me know.

59:40.360 --> 59:42.408
End of messages.

59:51.720 --> 59:52.740
Hi, Carol.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.046
Hi, stranger.

59:54.560 --> 59:55.891
Are those for me?

59:56.360 --> 59:59.330
No, I thought I'd just carry
some flowers around tonight.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.044
They're beautiful. Come on in.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.366
I'll put them in some water.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.726
Thank you.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.900
Oh. Hot date tonight?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.001
Rona!

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:16.210
Rona, this is Bill.
Bill, Rona, my friend.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.731
Nice to meet you, Rona.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.365
I've seen you at the Oaks.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.340
Did you two have plans?

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.900
No, actually I was just stopping by

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.162
to see if she wanted
to take a walk, but,

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.202
I can tell you have
more exciting plans, so...

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.564
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.166
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.924
So how you doing?

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.885
Really well.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.331
Good.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.761
So I'm thinking this is going okay.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.080
Yeah.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.244
That we might want to spend
some more time with each other.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.690
You want something to drink?

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.410
Are you gonna have anything?

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.967
Well, I... I don't know.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.605
What are we doing?
Are we doing something?

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.410
I think so.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.402
Yeah, because you know,
I'm out of practice with this

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.660
sort of thing.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.820
And please don't say
it's like riding a bike,

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.605
because I can't ride
a bike to save my life.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.683
It's just like swinging a golf club.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.100
Well, now, how would you know that?

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.565
You don't play golf.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.444
Oh, God.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.845
Yeah. I guess it is more like
riding a bike.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.725
A very nice bike.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.842
We should do it again.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.540
I can't. Well, not now.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.483
I don't mean now.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.841
I need some time to recuperate.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.841
It's been a while for me, too.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.700
I don't believe that.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.131
That's true.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.964
What did your husband do?

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.847
Why are you asking me about my husband?

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.725
I was just curious.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.288
I just want to know more about you.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.005
He was a lawyer.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.881
His name was Bill, by the way.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.569
You got to be kidding.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.844
What was he like?

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.330
Nothing like you.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.220
I'm sorry, I don't have any jam.

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.685
Oh, no jam?

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.171
That's beautiful. Thank you.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.580
So, uh, you know what, it's supposed
to really get hot later on,

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.660
so I thought after we
digest our breakfast,

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.171
maybe we'll have a swim?

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.680
That'd be good.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:17.242
So, have you ever thought
about getting remarried?

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.600
What?

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.011
God, I hope you're
speaking theoretically.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.251
Yeah, maybe.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.140
What does that mean?

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.740
You're not speaking theoretically?

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.180
I'm just testing the water.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.740
Well, just get out of the water.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.205
I barely know you.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.882
Too soon to ask your thoughts?

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.570
I never considered.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.721
Never?

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.122
No. I mean, I've been married.

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.402
Well, we get married
and the next thing is what?

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.604
I'm washing your underwear?

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.051
I guess that's part
of being married, isn't it?

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.926
Oh...

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.209
Who could that be this early?

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.601
Oh.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.841
Hey.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.211
Is this a pool cleaning day?

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.170
Actually, I quit.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.761
Ah.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.605
The owners and I had differences.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.820
Well, you know, actually
we completely agreed

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.900
that I shouldn't be
working there anymore.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.140
Yeah, I just wanted to just,
you know, come by and tell you that

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.005
I'm not gonna be cleaning
your pool anymore, so...

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.046
Wow.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.364
But I was looking
for another job anyway.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.886
An opening came up,
so it all worked out well.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.204
What kind of job did you get?

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.085
A pool cleaner.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.527
Just a new outfit.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.340
Pools By Us.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.900
Well, with the economy the way it is,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.004
I can't just go changing
careers willy-nilly.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.563
Got to stick with my skill set.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.201
Um...

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.420
Carol, are we good?

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.940
Yeah, of course we are.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.041
Okay.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.049
- Ah. Bill.
- Hey.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.130
Bill, this is Lloyd. Lloyd, Bill.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.170
- Hey, Lloyd.
- Bill.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.260
Lloyd's the pool guy.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.124
Ah. The pool guy.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:33.140
Actually I was just telling Carol
that I'm not the pool guy anymore.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:36.483
I mean, I'm not gonna
be cleaning her pool.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.049
Moving on to other pools.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.326
Good luck with that.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.220
So we're just having some breakfast.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.845
You want to join us?

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.011
No, no, no, no, no. Thank you.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.727
- Well, nice meeting you.
- You, too.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.601
Okay.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.005
Yeah.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.731
Bye, Carol.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.962
So when can I see you again?

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.060
Well, my daughter's
coming to town tomorrow,

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.845
so I need to spend
a little time with her.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.571
Your daughter?

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.845
Jesus, did I not tell you
that I had a daughter?

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.486
No. Not that I asked.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:34.645
Well, I have a daughter.
Kath. Katherine.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.087
Katherine.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.042
I'd like to meet her sometime.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.042
Well, I'll see about that.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.681
Okay.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.005
Look, I'm sorry.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.844
This is just all really new for me.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.370
I understand.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.650
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.164
I like you, Carol.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.165
I'll let myself out.

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.406
Hi.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.484
So glad to see you. Good flight?

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.170
It was all right. Yeah.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.564
- Mom.
- What?

01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:01.779
Are we gonna talk at all on this visit

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.260
or are we just gonna
sit quietly like this?

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:07.363
Do you want a glass of wine?
'Cause I want a glass of wine.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.962
- How are you doing, Mom?
- I'm fine.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.620
No, I mean, really?

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.529
Really. Really, I'm fine.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:18.500
'Cause you seem a little, I don't know.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.600
What?

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:23.564
Different, I guess. Is it Hazel?

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.580
I mean, you always call me back and
you didn't call me back till yesterday.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.740
I almost canceled my ticket.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.100
Oh, God, I'm sorry, honey.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.042
I've just... I've been very, very busy.

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:34.322
With what? You're never busy.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.340
No, I mean, not in a bad way.
It's just...

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.660
You're never particularly busy.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.020
I think that's pretty fair to say.

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.260
You know, I have a life, sweetie.

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:44.205
It may be hard for you to imagine,
but I do have a life.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.810
Okay. That's great, Mom.
I was just curious.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.247
God, where is that waitress?

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.970
I'm seeing somebody.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.371
Are you serious?

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.082
Oh, my God.
Is this the first time since Dad?

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.805
Twenty years?

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.406
- Wow!
- Yeah.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.860
See, I knew it.
I knew something was different.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.100
I could tell in your eyes.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.841
You weren't as preoccupied
with just yourself.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.220
Oh, thanks.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.164
Well, come on. You usually are.
You know you are.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.082
Well, I am preoccupied, that's for sure.

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.170
Yeah, you are. Do you like him?

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.660
How long has it been going on?

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.380
Well, like a couple of dates.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.482
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.528
Yeah, you like him.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.724
No, seriously.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.060
Well, are you gonna call him?

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.500
'Cause I'd really like
to meet him actually.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.460
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, Mom.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:50.140
I'll make spaghetti and we'll just
keep it real casual.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.860
You know, we won't make
a big deal out of it.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.122
You're the one making
a big deal out of it.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.321
Whatever.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.165
You have two new messages.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:02.500
Carol, oh, God,
I wish you had a cell phone.

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.126
It's Rona and I
was at the clubhouse and...

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.845
Just call me, okay?

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.010
Next message.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.740
Carol, for Christ's sake,
call me on my cell phone!

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.729
Call me as soon as you can.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.640
End of messages.

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.700
Excuse me. I'm here
to see Bill, Bill Young.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.404
He was admitted earlier today.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.971
- Bill Young?
- Yes.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.540
Are you a family member?

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.140
No, I'm a friend.

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.060
I'm sorry, but at this time,
only the immediate family is allowed.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.020
Yes, but I just...
I want to see if he's okay.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.020
I'm so sorry, but I can't
give you any information

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.020
unless you're a family member.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.500
Couldn't we maybe leave a number

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.170
and you can contact us?

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.220
If you leave me your number,
I'll try and get someone to call you.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.300
Thank you.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.420
Here. Give her my number.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.601
Okay.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.005
Okay.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.124
Thank you very much.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.041
Thanks.

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.140
I don't know why we do this.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.241
Do what?

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.924
Why we get attached
to people in the first place.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.780
It's always so much worry.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:27.804
I barely know this man and look at me.

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.650
Well, you're a good person.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:40.482
When you were young,
when you were just a little baby...

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:44.540
Well, it's lucky you don't remember this
because you were...

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.290
You were sick all the time.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.931
There was a lot of

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.845
illness and hospitals

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.442
and sleepless nights.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:58.970
Not really worth it, huh?

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.971
You were worth it.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.686
Hello?

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:16.801
Yes.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.122
Yes, yes, I am.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.051
What...

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.685
What was it?

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.365
No, thank you, thank you for the call.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.531
You doing okay?

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.171
I don't know.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.610
You feel like talking?

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.565
You know, there's a...

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.283
There's a box or two of your things

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.164
that are still up
in the guest room closet.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.004
Maybe you should go through it
before you head back.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.007
Okay.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.721
Mom.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.171
Look what I found.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.970
Where was this?

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:19.806
Maine, I think.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.160
Oh, yeah.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.888
You know, when that picture was taken,

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.122
growing old was the furthest thing
from my mind.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.647
I don't remember saying to your dad,

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.363
"Why don't you die in a plane crash,
and I'll grow old alone."

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.326
You know, he wanted
to get married, this guy.

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.765
- Bill?
- Yeah.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.691
I liked him.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.325
I really liked him.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.451
I just didn't know him.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.366
Who knows?
Maybe it would have worked out.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:10.644
I mean, I just feel so incomplete.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.246
Like there's supposed
to be something more.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.500
You've had a great life, Mom.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.840
A full life.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.180
A great husband and a career in music.

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.580
And a wonderful career as a teacher.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.170
Not that wonderful.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.524
And you had me.

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.900
It's all in the past tense.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.886
Everything you just said
is what I had, what I did.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.809
I'm still here.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.287
And you're the best of what I had.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.250
You and Dad.

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.808
I loved your father, Kath.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.961
Yeah, I know, Mom.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.900
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.490
Can I get you something?

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.060
Uh... Yeah. I'd like an appletini.

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.525
- Got it.
- Please.

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:19.726
Actually, no, I'd like a Modelo.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.620
Do you want a glass with that?

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.846
No.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.491
Hey, is there karaoke tonight?

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.646
No, we actually only do that
on Thursday nights.

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.801
Ah.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.451
Sorry.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.123
There you go. Enjoy.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.445
Nice uniform.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.161
Why, thank you.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.020
Pools By Us has a little
stricter dress code.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.281
You like it?

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.485
Well, I like a man in uniform.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.170
Come on in.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.251
Would you like something to drink?

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.420
I'm okay.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.601
Yeah.

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.843
I don't need the pool cleaned.

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.700
The guy just did it, actually.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.847
Okay.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.780
Did he do a good job?

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.291
Well, it was okay.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.770
Sorry I stopped by the other day
unannounced while your friend was here.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.961
I should've called first. Um...

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.646
Are you okay?

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.241
The rat.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.286
I got it! I got it.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.644
What should I do with it?
Should I kill it or...

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.162
Carol, are you okay?

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.121
Carol.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.980
I just lost my friend.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.765
That guy that you met, Bill.

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.288
He died. He died.

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.450
That's terrible.

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.127
And I keep wondering

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.721
what made his body stop.

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:26.286
What made it say,

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.444
"I'm done."

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.847
I just don't get it, Lloyd.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.130
There's nothing to get.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.841
I hate that fucking rat.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.202
We got it. We got you.

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.691
That might be my biggest
accomplishment right now.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:03.220
Come on, you're young.
You got a lot more life to...

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:04.606
Screw it up even more?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.209
You got plenty to show for it.
You know that, Lloyd.

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.081
I wrote a song.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.100
I want to hear it.

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:19.531
Yeah, someday I'll sing it to you.

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:21.483
No, I want to hear it now.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.921
- Really? Right now?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.486
Um...

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:33.250
I mean, I would need
a guitar or something.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.320
Okay. Uh...

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:45.100
I'm not finished with this.

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:46.884
It's a work in progress, so,

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.322
keep your expectations low.

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:13.167
I walk alone

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:17.500
I didn't know where I was going

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:21.321
I felt so low.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:25.845
As the moonlight started showing.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:30.247
Then I saw you.

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:35.886
Somewhere in the distance and you said.

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.688
"How are you?

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.100
"You're not gonna want to miss this."

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.285
When the sun goes down

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.485
I think of you now.

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.804
When the moon comes up

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.700
I don't turn around

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.540
I just stare at the darkness.

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:05.928
And I think of you there.

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:10.140
Way across the distance.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.926
Of that star-filled air.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:18.284
And I know I'll see you

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.609
I'll see you in my dreams.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.926
Sometimes things may flee you, but.

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.411
They never, ever leave.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:34.980
So I'll see you, I'll see you

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.641
I'll see you in my dreams

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:43.564
I'll see you, I'll see you

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.526
I'll see you in my dreams.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:51.208
Dreams, dreams

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:01.603
I mean, it's not about pools, but...

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.450
Thank you, Lloyd.

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:08.961
For what?

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.370
For coming by.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.604
Playing that song.

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.041
And for catching the rat.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.090
I'm glad I was here.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.646
Me, too.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.282
Should we do something about that guy?

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.564
You want a drink?

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.760
God. I think I got to get out of here.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.009
Go on a cruise or something.

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.682
What do you say?
You guys want to go with me?

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.100
Oh, come on, ladies.
I know you can all afford it.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.500
Yeah, depends on where.

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.443
- And when.
- And why.

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:29.361
Iceland.

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.260
Look, I don't know. Any place.

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.442
I told you why. I'm feeling agitated.

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.369
You mean, uh, horny?

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.845
That's what you mean.

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.202
I hear good things about Iceland.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.540
Well, I'm gonna go to New York
next month to see Kath.

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.420
Great, so why don't we meet in New York,

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.780
hop on a boat someplace.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.980
You guys, I get seasick,

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.500
and I keep reading about
people getting stranded

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:55.888
and people getting sick
and having that horrible diarrhea.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.970
That sounds fun, right?

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.322
And that fella Bill,
he had a boat, didn't he?

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:05.645
Yeah. So What.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:07.780
Oh, I was just asking.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.020
No, no, Georgia.

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.088
It was the name of the boat, So What.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.284
So what ever happened to the boat?

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.380
And all his stuff? No family?

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:17.100
He really had no one?

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.140
No. No family. Really.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.891
Truly, truly, nobody. He had a lawyer.

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.729
And judging by the funeral,
he had a lot of friends.

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.720
I asked his lawyer
if I could keep one of his things.

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.646
What happened to his boat?
To everything?

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.380
I don't know.

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:38.060
I mean, last I saw,
it was still at the dock.

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.740
You know, I can't know anymore.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.205
I don't want to know.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.845
God, I'd be dying to know.

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.450
Yeah, I know you would.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.460
Hey, what the hell?
Let's go. Let's go to Iceland.

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.460
- That sounds great.
- It does.

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.820
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:56.685
I will bring Dramamine, Rona.
You will be fine.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.340
And Imodium.

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.966
Why didn't I think of that? Imodium.

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.441
That's Beenie. He's a sweetheart.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.808
He's older. I think he's about 11 or 12.

01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:51.363
He is a sweetie.

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:56.287
A family had to give him up.
I forget why.
