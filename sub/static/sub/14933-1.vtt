01:02.695 --> 01:04.029
Thank you.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.164
Hazel...

01:05.166 --> 01:06.265
I believe this address

01:06.267 --> 01:07.599
is on your route?

01:07.601 --> 01:08.967
Yes.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.536
But why don't you just...

01:10.538 --> 01:13.005
It's been postmarked,
so perhaps you could...

01:13.007 --> 01:15.307
Deliver it today?

01:15.309 --> 01:16.475
Sure, but it'd still
be easier to...

01:16.477 --> 01:17.576
"A postmarked envelope

01:17.578 --> 01:20.479
must be delivered
to the street address thereon,"

01:20.481 --> 01:21.480
miss obacheena.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.581
Without regulations,

01:22.583 --> 01:24.917
we would have
a world without order,

01:24.919 --> 01:26.051
and a world
without order

01:26.053 --> 01:27.086
would be anarchy,

01:27.088 --> 01:28.387
and anarchy is...
Is, uh...

01:28.389 --> 01:29.822
Bad?

01:29.824 --> 01:30.856
Yes.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.224
Yes, thank you
for your assistance,

01:32.226 --> 01:34.026
and your discretion.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.330
Good morning, Oliver.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.331
Ms. mcinerney,

01:39.333 --> 01:40.833
all ready for
the Valentine rush?

01:40.835 --> 01:41.867
No.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.069
This just came through
from the terminal annex.

01:44.071 --> 01:46.772
It got routed through
special investigations,

01:46.774 --> 01:48.474
and they said you're
the man for the job,

01:48.476 --> 01:51.343
something about a mailbox
and an explosion.

01:51.345 --> 01:52.744
And I know what
you're going to say,

01:52.746 --> 01:54.646
"no Valentine is stupid

01:54.648 --> 01:56.081
if it's sent with good intent,"

01:56.083 --> 01:58.383
but I know you're going to say
something Oliver O'Toole-y,

01:58.385 --> 01:59.384
or...

03:02.248 --> 03:04.583
Excuse me, officer,

03:04.585 --> 03:06.618
where do I go
to turn myself in?

tomorrow night?

03:40.254 --> 03:41.520
Or is it
a surprise?

03:41.522 --> 03:43.488
Well, it's gonna be a surprise
if I can't find a restaurant.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.590
Oh, Norman,

03:44.592 --> 03:47.092
if you haven't made
a reservation yet,

03:47.094 --> 03:50.229
it's going to be too late
to find a nice place.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.363
I'm sorry,

03:51.365 --> 03:52.664
I've just never really done
the Valentine's day thing

03:52.666 --> 03:53.632
before.

03:53.634 --> 03:54.900
That's okay.

03:56.135 --> 03:57.402
You know, you could always
come to my place,

03:57.404 --> 03:59.504
and I could whip us up
something myself.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.606
No.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.107
We've...
We've talked about that.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.375
I will think of something.

04:04.544 --> 04:05.844
Don't worry.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.079
It's my first
Valentine's day, too.

04:09.515 --> 04:10.782
I mean, usually,
I go to the...

04:10.784 --> 04:13.318
Oh, my gosh, I don't have to go!

04:13.320 --> 04:15.120
Go where?

04:15.122 --> 04:16.488
Well, you know how
the folks from main facility

04:16.490 --> 04:18.357
who don't have dates
on Valentine's

04:18.358 --> 04:20.158
always have
their own party?

04:20.160 --> 04:22.861
Well, this year,
I won't be there.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.896
I will be in my kitchen
cooking for you.

04:26.799 --> 04:28.867
Oh, look,

04:28.869 --> 04:31.203
the Brazilian beef baron's
having a Valentine veal special!

04:31.205 --> 04:32.170
Oh.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.173
Morning!

04:35.175 --> 04:36.808
Hey, where should
Rita and I go

04:36.810 --> 04:38.010
for Valentine's day?

04:38.012 --> 04:41.046
I'd let you guys have
our reservation to montaldo's

04:41.048 --> 04:42.314
if, well...

04:42.316 --> 04:44.249
If I had a boyfriend.

04:44.251 --> 04:47.252
And if he had the good taste
to reserve a table for two

04:47.254 --> 04:49.288
at the nicest place in Denver.

04:49.290 --> 04:52.958
But I don't have a boyfriend.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.959
Nope.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.127
I work at
the post office

04:55.129 --> 04:57.663
delivering
other women's valentines

04:57.665 --> 04:59.031
from their boyfriends.

05:00.733 --> 05:01.833
Norman,

05:01.835 --> 05:03.168
could you please run these
to certified returns?

05:04.170 --> 05:05.170
Are you finished already?

05:05.172 --> 05:06.605
No.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.974
But I think it would be good
for you to run these up first,

05:08.976 --> 05:10.409
and then come back
for the rest later.

05:21.387 --> 05:22.521
Is there
such a thing

05:22.523 --> 05:23.555
as a fancy taco truck?

05:23.557 --> 05:25.324
No.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.325
Huh.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.761
So, you don't have a date
for tomorrow?

05:29.763 --> 05:32.731
Well, we can't all
have a Norman.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.500
I was kind of hoping
that Oliver would, you know...

05:35.502 --> 05:38.203
What?

05:38.205 --> 05:40.739
Me and Oliver?
That's ridiculous.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.842
No, Valentine's is...

05:43.844 --> 05:46.445
It's all about romance,

05:46.447 --> 05:50.449
and there is nothing romantic
between me and Oliver.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.550
We're so...

05:51.552 --> 05:52.551
I mean,

05:52.553 --> 05:54.419
I send emails,

05:54.421 --> 05:57.222
and he writes letters,

05:57.224 --> 05:59.458
I binge-watch on my iPad,

05:59.460 --> 06:01.426
and he goes to the library,

06:01.428 --> 06:02.527
I live in cherry creek,

06:02.529 --> 06:04.196
and he lives...

06:04.198 --> 06:05.364
Where does he live?

06:06.399 --> 06:07.666
You and Oliver have a thing.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.134
A thing?

06:09.136 --> 06:10.702
I can read the chemistry.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.471
Chemistry does not
a romance make, Rita.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.706
What?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.475
You're even starting
to talk like him.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.379
Well, Oliver is... a gentleman,

06:20.381 --> 06:23.048
and he is recently,

06:23.050 --> 06:25.016
amicably,

06:25.018 --> 06:26.218
but freshly divorced,

06:26.220 --> 06:29.588
and I doubt that he's ready
to take anyone out

06:29.590 --> 06:31.823
for Valentine's.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.326
Let alone a co-worker.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.994
A co-worker he has
a lot of chemistry with.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.964
Don't end a sentence
with a preposition.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.099
You did it again.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.770
Hey, where is Oliver?

07:17.703 --> 07:19.004
"Dear maddie,

07:19.006 --> 07:21.573
I don't know how you're going
to take this letter..."

07:21.575 --> 07:23.241
<i>"But I have to write it,</i>

07:23.243 --> 07:25.043
<i>"because you always demand</i>
<i>the truth from me,</i>

07:25.045 --> 07:26.178
<i>"and that's what you deserve,</i>

07:26.180 --> 07:28.780
<i>no matter how hard</i>
<i>it's going to be to hear."</i>

07:28.782 --> 07:30.682
<i>"I remember when I met you,</i>

07:30.684 --> 07:33.018
<i>at the first debate</i>
<i>of the season..."</i>

07:33.020 --> 07:34.052
"Oh, I have slipped

07:34.054 --> 07:35.153
the surly bonds
of earth,"

07:35.155 --> 07:37.088
wrote John Gillespie magee,

07:37.090 --> 07:38.190
a brave young aviator

07:38.192 --> 07:40.125
who captured
the sheerly awesome experience

07:40.127 --> 07:43.562
of pushing the boundaries
of space in 1941...

07:43.564 --> 07:45.897
"Sheerly awesome?"

07:45.899 --> 07:47.098
How can we put a price tag
on vision?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.967
On the courage of a man
like John magee,

07:48.969 --> 07:50.936
who died believing in
something greater than himself?

07:52.104 --> 07:54.773
For a much smaller price
than he had to pay,

07:54.775 --> 07:56.441
how can we not
continue his journey?

07:56.443 --> 07:58.343
A journey where we,
as John said,

07:58.345 --> 08:00.612
may someday also
"touch the face of God."

08:09.188 --> 08:10.655
Breakfast.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.728
<i>Requests for overtime</i>

08:16.730 --> 08:18.196
<i>and part-time time cards</i>

08:18.198 --> 08:20.632
<i>must be submitted</i>
<i>by 4:00 P.M. today.</i>

08:22.134 --> 08:24.102
Uh-huh...

08:25.105 --> 08:26.638
Do you have any idea

08:26.640 --> 08:29.174
how hard it is
to postmark a bear?

08:29.176 --> 08:30.242
Gimme.
Let it go...

08:32.178 --> 08:33.378
Uh, this is

08:33.380 --> 08:34.446
Ms. haywith's colleague,
Mr. dorman.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.280
Could you repeat
that, please?

08:37.717 --> 08:39.351
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.352
Right, yeah,
no problem.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.352
She'll be there.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.354
<i>Great...</i>

08:43.323 --> 08:44.456
Yes, yes,

08:44.458 --> 08:46.091
it's amazing.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.492
<i>- Thank you so much. Bye.</i>
- Thank you.

08:47.494 --> 08:48.627
Norman?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.262
Uh, remember when

08:50.264 --> 08:51.396
Rita went
to the national

08:51.398 --> 08:52.464
miss special
delivery pageant

08:52.466 --> 08:53.565
in Washington, D.C.,

08:53.567 --> 08:54.666
and was fourth runner-up?

08:54.668 --> 08:57.469
She did receive
the miss special handling award.

08:57.471 --> 08:58.537
What's going on?

08:58.539 --> 09:00.238
Remember
the lady who won?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.206
Mindy, the singer.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.407
She quit
the post office.

09:02.409 --> 09:05.877
She got cast in les miz
on Broadway.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.445
She's the really
miserable one.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.047
So... what?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.549
So, the first
runner-up is on tour

09:10.551 --> 09:12.317
with her hip-hop group
postal mama.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.785
What about
the second runner-up?

09:13.787 --> 09:14.819
Pregnant.
Very pregnant.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.454
- Third?
- She's in jail.

09:16.456 --> 09:17.756
Something to do with

09:17.758 --> 09:19.024
counterfeit
Elvis commemoratives.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.826
So...

09:21.828 --> 09:23.361
So... there she is,

09:23.363 --> 09:25.764
miss United States
special delivery.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.299
No way.

09:27.301 --> 09:28.366
They're unveiling

09:28.368 --> 09:29.367
the new president's day
forever stamp,

09:29.369 --> 09:30.335
and they need her
in Washington

09:30.337 --> 09:31.336
to pull the sheet.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.005
Norman,

09:34.007 --> 09:35.674
I'm going to miss
our first Valentine's dinner

09:35.676 --> 09:37.242
together.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.910
You could have it tonight.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.345
My plane leaves tonight.

09:40.347 --> 09:43.882
How about
a nice romantic... lunch?

09:43.884 --> 09:45.550
I have to meet
my cousin, serge,

09:45.552 --> 09:46.952
at the mailbox grille
at 1:00 P.M.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.254
Weird serge from the pawn shop?

09:50.256 --> 09:51.256
I would cancel,

09:51.258 --> 09:52.891
but he said that
it's important.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.092
Oh.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.560
But you could
come with me.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.495
It won't be the same,
but at least we'd be together.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.830
Norman!

09:58.832 --> 09:59.798
Certifieds are in!

10:06.506 --> 10:07.572
Well...

10:07.574 --> 10:11.443
Looks like I'll be alone
on Valentine's after all.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.479
I really hope you're not.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.997
<i>...and a $300-million budget,</i>

10:31.999 --> 10:33.598
<i>which, in a survey released</i>
<i>last week</i>

10:33.600 --> 10:35.233
by the stetson research group,

10:35.235 --> 10:37.736
could have fully-funded
the recently-failed house bill

10:37.738 --> 10:39.871
hr24568,

10:39.873 --> 10:40.905
proposing a federal subsidy

10:40.907 --> 10:42.240
for public school
infrastructure,

10:42.242 --> 10:43.908
a far more relevant
and immediate goal

10:43.910 --> 10:45.410
than another foray

10:45.412 --> 10:46.778
into the black hole
of space exploration...

10:48.881 --> 10:50.148
Thank you, debaters,

10:50.150 --> 10:51.683
and that completes
the last round

10:51.685 --> 10:52.684
of the morning preliminaries.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.319
Please see the results
in the main hall,

10:54.321 --> 10:55.520
where the winners
will be paired off

10:55.522 --> 10:56.521
for the afternoon
finals.

11:01.227 --> 11:02.527
Hey.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.561
I like how you referenced

11:03.563 --> 11:04.996
the gross national product
of Russia

11:04.998 --> 11:06.431
during the '60s space race.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.599
It was very impressive.

11:07.601 --> 11:09.334
It must be my use
of actual facts

11:09.336 --> 11:11.536
and rigorous research
that you found so refreshing.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.471
I'm sorry?

11:13.473 --> 11:15.707
Look, you might be able to
skate through the early debates

11:15.709 --> 11:17.042
on charm

11:17.044 --> 11:19.144
and folksy
story-telling,

11:19.146 --> 11:20.545
but when you get to state
next spring,

11:20.547 --> 11:22.213
if you get to state,

11:22.215 --> 11:24.015
they'll be looking
for substance,

11:24.017 --> 11:25.483
not seduction.

11:27.086 --> 11:28.219
Come on, Becca,

11:28.221 --> 11:29.421
let's go.

11:29.423 --> 11:30.655
<i>"I always figured</i>
<i>sooner or later</i>

11:30.657 --> 11:32.824
<i>"somebody would see through</i>
<i>all the smoke and mirrors</i>

11:32.826 --> 11:36.027
<i>"and realize what I feared most</i>
<i>about myself,</i>

11:36.029 --> 11:39.998
<i>"that I wasn't a great debater,</i>
<i>just a good showman.</i>

11:40.000 --> 11:43.068
<i>"But nobody ever had the guts</i>
<i>to call me on it</i>

11:43.070 --> 11:44.069
<i>until you."</i>

11:44.071 --> 11:45.070
It's early, maddie.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.271
We'll get them next time.

11:53.145 --> 11:54.145
Yes!

11:54.147 --> 11:55.146
Sweet.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.054
<i>"I can only imagine</i>
<i>what you thought of me</i>

12:03.056 --> 12:04.189
<i>"after that first debate.</i>

12:04.191 --> 12:06.791
<i>"I never thought you'd be</i>
<i>anything more to me</i>

12:06.793 --> 12:09.661

12:13.133 --> 12:15.033
<i>"I never meant to hurt you,</i>

12:15.035 --> 12:16.234
<i>and I never meant to... "</i>

12:16.236 --> 12:19.170
Oh, my goodness.

12:21.707 --> 12:24.843
It's still
such a shock.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.511
Well, you
should have been

12:26.513 --> 12:27.812
miss United States
special delivery

12:27.814 --> 12:29.614
in the first place.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.517
This is a very bittersweet
victory, Norman.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.452
I'm going to miss you.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.491
First tweet of the new
miss special delivery.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.126
Congratulations!

12:42.528 --> 12:44.362
What was that?

12:44.364 --> 12:46.631
Well, you're going
to be famous now...

12:52.671 --> 12:54.472
Oh, Norman,

12:54.474 --> 12:55.540
I think
your cousin's here.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.342
Oh, serge!

12:57.344 --> 12:58.343
Over here!

12:59.945 --> 13:00.945
Oh!

13:00.947 --> 13:01.946
Oh...

13:14.593 --> 13:15.660
Ah, there you are.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.462
Oliver, Rita
just got a call from...

13:17.464 --> 13:19.764
I'm sorry,
Ms. mcinerney, not now.

13:19.766 --> 13:20.765
Please read this.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.667
Right here.

13:22.669 --> 13:25.370
"I never thought you'd be
anything more to me

13:25.372 --> 13:27.672
"than the competition
to beat this year.

13:27.674 --> 13:28.673
"What scares me

13:28.675 --> 13:31.209
"is what you're going to
think of me now.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.510
"I never meant to hurt you
last night, maddie,

13:32.512 --> 13:34.379
"and I never meant to...

13:34.381 --> 13:36.481
Kill anyone."

13:40.586 --> 13:43.354
These are pretty
amazing, serge.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.324
You've got a whole lot of
vintage valentines here.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.193
Norman, look at this one.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.061
"My heart leaps for you!"

13:50.063 --> 13:51.429
So, are these

13:51.431 --> 13:52.931
from a private
collection of yours?

13:54.867 --> 13:56.034
"Yes."

13:56.036 --> 13:57.035
I bet you
you got these

13:57.037 --> 13:58.036
at the pawn shop.

13:59.205 --> 14:00.305
"Yes."

14:00.307 --> 14:01.372
It's like

14:01.374 --> 14:03.575
he's taken a vow
of silence or something.

14:03.577 --> 14:04.909
"I have taken
a vow of silence."

14:04.911 --> 14:06.077
Well, there you go.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.078
Why?

14:08.247 --> 14:09.814
"I am moving
to Minnesota

14:09.816 --> 14:11.983
to join the little brothers
of perpetual frost."

14:13.853 --> 14:15.820
"It's a monastic order

14:15.822 --> 14:18.156
dedicated to meditation
and contemplative ice fishing."

14:18.158 --> 14:19.891
Well, you've always been
very spiritual.

14:20.993 --> 14:21.993
"I know you're
an expert

14:21.995 --> 14:23.461
"in mail and stuff,

14:23.463 --> 14:26.164
and I heard you were
in love..."

14:28.434 --> 14:31.002
"So I want you
to have these."

14:31.004 --> 14:32.637
Me?

14:32.639 --> 14:35.139
These could be worth
a lot of money, serge.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.143
"I took a vow
of poverty, too."

14:40.713 --> 14:41.713
That's really
nice of you.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.114
Thanks.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.549
Good luck.

14:50.022 --> 14:50.989
If you're ever in Minnesota,

14:50.991 --> 14:51.990
look me up.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.057
We'll fish.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.526
I-I didn't have a card
for that.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.508
I guess this is it.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.644
I could drive you
to the airport.

15:12.646 --> 15:15.580
Oh, thanks, Norman,
but you don't have a car.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.683
And I still have to
go home and pack,

15:18.685 --> 15:20.551
so I guess this is...

15:20.553 --> 15:22.453
Goodbye, for now.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.821
But I'll be back
on Monday.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.323
Okay.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.324
Okay,

15:26.326 --> 15:29.794
and I'll think of you
every day.

15:37.202 --> 15:38.770
Whoa.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.339
Norman, look at this.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.440
What?

15:43.676 --> 15:45.843
Uh... linen envelope,

15:45.845 --> 15:48.713
silk ribbon,

15:48.715 --> 15:49.714
postmarked by hand,

15:49.716 --> 15:51.115
1835,

15:51.117 --> 15:52.183
addressed to
postmaster

15:52.185 --> 15:53.685
Mr... Somebody.

15:53.687 --> 15:54.752
New Salem, ill...

15:54.754 --> 15:56.554
Illinois?

15:56.556 --> 15:58.089
Norman, think.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.424
Postmaster,

15:59.426 --> 16:00.725
new Salem, Illinois?

16:00.727 --> 16:02.627
1835?

16:03.629 --> 16:05.263
Oh! Wow.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.365
Wow...

16:09.335 --> 16:11.636
Wow.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.704
We're going to have fun
with this one.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.439
We?

16:14.441 --> 16:18.042
You're asking me
for my help,

16:18.044 --> 16:19.210
aren't you?

16:19.212 --> 16:21.379
Well, I think

16:21.381 --> 16:23.414
any letter containing
a reference to killing someone

16:23.416 --> 16:26.351
demands special attention.

16:28.854 --> 16:32.123
Well, let's see.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.958
The envelope is useless,

16:33.960 --> 16:36.527
half the pages are singed,

16:36.529 --> 16:37.528
and all we have so far

16:37.530 --> 16:39.097
are two high school
debate teams

16:39.099 --> 16:40.231
from 15 years ago.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.967
Putting maddie
at about 16 or 17.

16:42.969 --> 16:46.471
Debate competitions
move around every month,

16:46.473 --> 16:47.772
from host school
to host school,

16:47.774 --> 16:49.374
kind of like
a football season,

16:49.376 --> 16:52.043
so she could live anywhere
in the tristate area.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.778
And a good debater
spends so much time

16:53.780 --> 16:56.414
researching and prepping
every possible topic,

16:56.416 --> 16:57.882
that they don't really
have time to kill anyone.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.185
I debated in high school.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.154
Astonishing.

17:03.156 --> 17:07.791
Well, teenagers,
debates, death...

17:07.794 --> 17:09.260
I've googled with less.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.038
Okay, I'm running a search

17:20.040 --> 17:21.906
for all high school debate teams

17:21.907 --> 17:25.742
15 years ago in Colorado,
Wyoming, and Utah.

17:25.744 --> 17:26.711
It should take...

17:26.713 --> 17:27.712
Forever.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.013
Forever?

17:29.015 --> 17:30.782
A day, probably.

17:30.784 --> 17:33.484
Do you wanna wait?

17:33.486 --> 17:34.452
No.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.487
Okay.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.756
Uh, we should settle in,

17:38.758 --> 17:40.625
then.

17:40.627 --> 17:41.626
Oh, uh...

17:41.628 --> 17:42.593
Sorry.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.029
Here we go.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.799
Thank you.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.473
People do crazy things
for Valentine's, don't they?

17:55.475 --> 17:57.742
I suppose.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.846
So, here we go.

18:01.848 --> 18:05.349
"Do you remember
the second competition?

18:05.351 --> 18:09.921
"The resolution was the national
minimum-drinking-age law

18:09.923 --> 18:10.922
<i>should be repealed."</i>

18:10.924 --> 18:11.923
The resolution was

18:11.925 --> 18:12.924
the national
minimum-drinking-age law...

18:12.926 --> 18:15.426
- ...should be repealed.
- Heads.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.427
Your call.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.462
Con.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.371
On the contrary,

18:27.373 --> 18:29.207
to suggest that lowering
the drinking age to 18

18:29.209 --> 18:31.642
will curtail bad behavior
in underage students

18:31.644 --> 18:33.644
reminds me of the time
when I was 12, in the summer,

18:33.646 --> 18:35.213
and I grew four inches.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.048
I grew so fast,
that my legs were able

18:37.050 --> 18:39.217
to hit the accelerator
of the family truck.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.718
But my dad was smart enough

18:40.720 --> 18:42.420
not to give me
the keys to the car, though.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.623
Not only do statistics

18:45.625 --> 18:47.492
support the belief
that the 21 and over law

18:47.494 --> 18:49.727
encourages more
illegal purchases

18:49.729 --> 18:50.728
and consumption
of alcohol

18:50.730 --> 18:52.230
among underage students,

18:52.232 --> 18:54.499
it fosters dangerous
and sometimes fatal behaviors,

18:54.501 --> 18:57.135
such as binge-drinking,
not to mention...

19:03.442 --> 19:04.475
The debate was carried

19:04.477 --> 19:06.077
by the team from...

19:06.079 --> 19:07.078
Wyoming,

19:07.080 --> 19:08.146
arguing the pro side.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.117
Semi-finals will begin
after lunch.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.092
Nice try, you guys.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.126
Really.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.828
Thanks, Paige.

19:26.732 --> 19:27.765
I don't know
about you, man,

19:27.767 --> 19:28.766
but I could use
a fat burger

19:28.768 --> 19:30.434
and a six-pack right now.

19:30.436 --> 19:31.736
Very funny.

19:34.039 --> 19:36.007
Nevertheless,

19:36.009 --> 19:37.175
many Americans believe that...

19:37.177 --> 19:38.709
On the other hand,

19:38.711 --> 19:40.278
statistics have shown
over the last few years...

19:40.280 --> 19:41.846
You skate like
you debate, you know.

19:43.883 --> 19:44.882
Excuse me?

19:44.884 --> 19:47.285
Left, right,
left, right.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.653
You're not going with the flow.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.087
You know,
you're not having any fun.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.957
I don't do this
to have fun, okay?

19:52.959 --> 19:54.225
I do it to prepare.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.928
I pick a topic,
and left is pro, right is con.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.863
You drive down from Wyoming
every month

19:58.865 --> 19:59.864
for these things, huh?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.732
Do you take
anything seriously?

20:01.734 --> 20:02.733
What's your problem with me?

20:02.735 --> 20:03.901
It is physically
impossible

20:03.903 --> 20:05.603
for a 12-year-old to grow
four inches in three months.

20:06.605 --> 20:07.672
Details.

20:07.674 --> 20:08.906
You don't do
your homework.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.908
You do just enough to get by,

20:10.910 --> 20:12.577
and then
when you run out of facts,

20:12.579 --> 20:13.544
you make them up.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.613
Hey, Abraham Lincoln
was a great debater,

20:15.615 --> 20:17.081
but he didn't win
on just statistics,

20:17.083 --> 20:19.050
he gave a little
personality, too.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.418
You...

20:20.420 --> 20:21.652
Are not Abraham Lincoln.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.720
True.

20:22.722 --> 20:26.324
But I bet I could be
a good president one day.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.626
Well, you could, like,
play one on TV.

20:29.628 --> 20:30.595
Look, okay,

20:30.597 --> 20:33.030
I know how
to sell an idea,

20:33.032 --> 20:35.967
but I'm short
on statistics.

20:35.969 --> 20:37.602
You are great
with research,

20:37.604 --> 20:39.904
but you never,
ever smile.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.572
I gotta learn
to use my head,

20:41.574 --> 20:43.507
and you gotta learn
to use your heart.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.343
I think we can help
each other out here.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.577
Why?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.479
Why would I want to help
the competition?

20:48.481 --> 20:49.547
I mean, unless you're
trying to psych me out,

20:49.549 --> 20:50.748
and trust me, you can't.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.749
Okay, well then,

20:51.751 --> 20:53.618
then...

20:53.620 --> 20:57.555
What if we just...

20:57.557 --> 20:59.223
Skate?

21:02.194 --> 21:03.194
Fine,

21:03.196 --> 21:04.295

22:58.911 --> 23:00.478

of maddie alstrup

23:00.480 --> 23:01.679
feeling today?

23:01.681 --> 23:03.647
Feels pretty good.

23:03.649 --> 23:06.751
And you were kind of
great today.

23:06.753 --> 23:07.852
You might even make it to state.

23:07.854 --> 23:08.853
Maybe.

23:08.855 --> 23:09.854
Maybe?

23:09.856 --> 23:11.889
Are you basing that
on your research,

23:11.891 --> 23:14.692
or are you finally
trusting your instincts?

23:32.512 --> 23:33.511
<i>"I keep thinking</i>

23:33.513 --> 23:34.845
<i>"how different</i>
<i>everything would be now</i>

23:34.847 --> 23:37.815
"if I just hadn't
kissed you that day.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.150
"But I did,

23:39.152 --> 23:41.285
and nothing will ever
be the same."

23:43.156 --> 23:44.355
Well, that's sweet.

23:44.357 --> 23:47.224
He kissed her,
and everything changed.

23:47.226 --> 23:50.494
Everything certainly changed
for whomever he killed.

23:50.496 --> 23:53.964
Yes, well, there's that.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.501
That kiss

23:57.503 --> 24:00.037
set something into motion,

24:00.039 --> 24:01.672
and someone died.

24:02.641 --> 24:04.542
I'll filter the program

24:04.544 --> 24:06.944
to search for fatalities

24:06.946 --> 24:09.346
occurring around the time
the mailbox blew up.

24:14.052 --> 24:15.519
Okay, here it is.
Saturday, march...

24:15.521 --> 24:17.354
24th.

24:17.356 --> 24:19.056
It was 4:15 in the afternoon.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.767
Is there something
you want to tell me, Oliver?

24:39.010 --> 24:40.077
We're out,

24:40.079 --> 24:41.412
and I'm not prepared

24:41.414 --> 24:44.215
to discuss this yoo-hoo free.

24:44.217 --> 24:46.050
I wasn't going to
tell you this,

24:46.052 --> 24:47.751
but I have Angie the barista

24:47.753 --> 24:50.187
keep a couple of emergency
yoo-hoos for you

24:50.189 --> 24:51.889
behind the bar
at the mailbox grille.

24:54.926 --> 25:00.231
Ms. mcinerney, you never
cease to surprise me,

25:00.233 --> 25:02.933
and I hope to someday
return the favor.

25:05.537 --> 25:10.040
I started in the post office
as a zip code shelver,

25:10.042 --> 25:12.610
and moved up
to mail carrier.

25:12.612 --> 25:15.079
15 years ago,
I had this route,

25:15.081 --> 25:16.914
I walked these streets,

25:16.916 --> 25:19.049
collected the mail from
that box on the corner

25:19.051 --> 25:20.951
every day at 4:00.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.887
<i>It was supposed to be 3:55,</i>
<i>but, well,</i>

25:22.889 --> 25:26.690
<i>i had a sort of crush</i>
<i>on the female police officer</i>

25:26.692 --> 25:28.459
<i>who covered the same beat.</i>

25:28.461 --> 25:29.827
<i>Most days around 4:00,</i>

25:29.829 --> 25:33.597
<i>she'd be parked over there</i>

25:33.599 --> 25:35.399
taking her break,

25:35.401 --> 25:36.433
sipping a cup of coffee,

25:36.435 --> 25:37.401
and I'd make sure

25:37.403 --> 25:38.469
that I happened to be

25:38.471 --> 25:41.805
<i>cleaning out the mailbox</i>
<i>at the same time,</i>

25:41.807 --> 25:43.841
<i>and we'd have</i>
<i>a pleasant conversation.</i>

25:43.843 --> 25:45.943
<i>And one day, she wasn't there,</i>

25:45.945 --> 25:48.646
<i>and instead of cleaning out</i>
<i>the mailbox</i>

25:48.648 --> 25:49.813
<i>and going on my way,</i>

25:49.815 --> 25:51.549
<i>i stalled.</i>

25:51.551 --> 25:53.551
I went to the coffee shop
and got a coffee,

25:53.553 --> 25:55.786
<i>and waited to see if she'd show.</i>

25:57.690 --> 25:59.423
<i>And then some clown,</i>

25:59.425 --> 26:00.424
<i>an actual clown,</i>

26:00.426 --> 26:03.260
<i>ran his party truck</i>
<i>over the curb,</i>

26:03.262 --> 26:04.728
<i>and a tank of helium</i>
<i>in the back</i>

26:04.730 --> 26:06.530
<i>must have tipped over</i>

26:06.532 --> 26:09.233
<i>and rolled onto</i>
<i>a block of dry ice.</i>

26:10.402 --> 26:11.602
<i>And of course,</i>

26:11.604 --> 26:14.204
<i>when helium experiences</i>
<i>a sudden change of temperature,</i>

26:14.206 --> 26:15.205
<i>well...</i>

26:29.588 --> 26:33.424
<i>I knew I'd never rest</i>
<i>until I'd made things right,</i>

26:33.426 --> 26:37.461
<i>because none of those letters</i>
<i>would have been damaged</i>

26:37.463 --> 26:39.930
<i>if I'd just done my job.</i>

26:39.932 --> 26:41.298
No one ever thought
to blame me, but I knew,

26:41.300 --> 26:43.934
so I volunteered
to help recover them.

26:43.936 --> 26:44.935
And it was then
that I realized

26:44.937 --> 26:46.904
they weren't just letters,

26:46.906 --> 26:48.272
they were lives.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.274
A birthday card,
a house payment,

26:50.276 --> 26:51.475
an apology.

26:52.811 --> 26:54.878
When we were finished...

26:54.880 --> 26:57.982
When I thought
we were finished...

26:57.984 --> 26:59.283
I didn't want to stop.

26:59.285 --> 27:03.787
I knew I wanted to
keep doing that,

27:03.789 --> 27:04.822
trying to restore

27:04.824 --> 27:08.692
what was lost.

27:08.694 --> 27:10.861
So I applied to
the dead letter office.

27:10.863 --> 27:14.732
And look at all the good
you've done.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.368
Leave the past in the past
where it belongs.

27:18.937 --> 27:20.938
I thought I had.

27:28.580 --> 27:31.682
Feels like
a double-fudge day, hmm?

27:31.684 --> 27:32.950
Why not?

27:38.089 --> 27:39.456
Norman?

27:46.698 --> 27:48.098
Norman?

27:49.634 --> 27:51.135
Are you all right,
my friend?

27:52.504 --> 27:58.108
Oh, uh, my cousin gave me
a box of antique valentines,

27:58.110 --> 27:59.576
and one of them
is incredibly old

27:59.578 --> 28:01.478
and will probably
send shock waves

28:01.480 --> 28:03.347
through the annals
of American history,

28:03.349 --> 28:05.449
and Rita's gone home
to pack,

28:05.451 --> 28:07.518
and then she's flying
to Washington D.C.,

28:07.520 --> 28:10.988
so I'm going to spend
Valentine's day here alone,

28:10.990 --> 28:12.289
with my cigar box,

28:12.291 --> 28:13.557
without her.

28:13.559 --> 28:14.992
Alone.

28:14.994 --> 28:18.262
Norman, I think you may be
overstating the importance

28:18.264 --> 28:19.263
of Valentine's day.

28:19.265 --> 28:22.433
It's really just
a made-up holiday

28:22.435 --> 28:23.600
to sell chocolate

28:23.602 --> 28:25.469
and pressure men to take you
to a romantic restaurant,

28:25.471 --> 28:27.171
and say that they can't live
without you.

28:28.506 --> 28:29.707
Unless, of course,

28:29.709 --> 28:31.575
they don't say

28:31.577 --> 28:33.277
they can't live without you,

28:33.279 --> 28:35.345
and then you just end up
crying in the ladies room.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.684
A rather bleak assessment,
Ms. mcinerney.

28:40.686 --> 28:43.687
I prefer to think
of Valentine's

28:43.689 --> 28:47.257
as simply an opportunity
for two people

28:47.259 --> 28:48.992
to recognize
a mutual interest,

28:48.994 --> 28:51.261
enjoy a quiet meal,

28:51.263 --> 28:54.998
perhaps even celebrate
the multi-faceted nature of love

28:55.000 --> 28:57.568
as defined
by the greeks,

28:57.570 --> 29:00.204
phileo, storge, Eros, and agape.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.340
Hence, the ladies room.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.675
Hence?

29:04.677 --> 29:07.478
You know, you're really
starting to sound like Oliver.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.879
Okay, well...

29:08.881 --> 29:10.080
Well, I am sure

29:10.082 --> 29:11.615
Oliver would be happy

29:11.617 --> 29:13.383
to take you out on Valentine's

29:13.385 --> 29:15.853
and keep you company.

29:17.255 --> 29:20.190
Oh, unless
you're already booked?

29:20.192 --> 29:21.925
Well...

29:21.927 --> 29:23.794
That's okay,

29:23.796 --> 29:25.162
I'll just
have dinner with Shane.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.163
No!

29:26.165 --> 29:27.264
Uh... I mean,

29:27.266 --> 29:28.832
she may already
have plans.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.135
Do you?

29:32.403 --> 29:33.403
Um...

29:33.405 --> 29:34.972
Oh, wait!

29:34.974 --> 29:36.740
There's a lecture
tomorrow night

29:36.742 --> 29:38.275
at the Colorado
stamp collectors club.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.276
I guess I could do that.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.410
Yes!

29:40.412 --> 29:42.079
That's a wonderful idea.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.748
Nothing like a little
philatelic diversion

29:44.750 --> 29:46.984
to take your mind
off your troubles.

29:48.052 --> 29:50.988
Well, Ms. mcinerney,
it has been a long day...

29:50.990 --> 29:53.757
It's 3:00.

29:53.759 --> 29:54.892
Norman can analyze
maddie's letter,

29:54.894 --> 29:57.161
I'll evaluate
the historical significance

29:57.163 --> 29:59.930
of his mysterious Valentine.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.599
Why don't you just, um...

30:02.601 --> 30:03.967
Take the rest of the day off?

30:05.703 --> 30:08.505
I thought we had more
to talk about.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.874
Nothing that can't
wait till tomorrow.

30:10.876 --> 30:13.076
Norman and I need some man time.

30:14.078 --> 30:15.445
Go home.

30:15.447 --> 30:16.446
Relax.

30:16.448 --> 30:17.481
Putter.

30:17.483 --> 30:18.949
Check your mail.

30:21.619 --> 30:23.453
Putter.

30:23.455 --> 30:24.655
Okay.

30:30.662 --> 30:31.762
Check my mail...

30:31.764 --> 30:32.996
Huh.

30:34.599 --> 30:38.569
It must be serious
if I, uh, need some man time.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.874
The course of true love

30:43.876 --> 30:45.876
never did run
smooth, Norman,

30:45.878 --> 30:47.244
but you and Rita

30:47.246 --> 30:49.479
have declared your
feelings for each other,

30:49.481 --> 30:52.249
you've finally put
your raft in the river.

30:52.251 --> 30:55.152
You may hit a few rocks
along the way, but...

30:57.188 --> 30:58.689
But at least you've
begun the journey.

31:00.658 --> 31:04.862
Now, what's all this about
rewriting American history?

31:04.864 --> 31:06.196
Hmm?

31:10.768 --> 31:12.803
It's postmarked 1835.

31:12.805 --> 31:15.606
I haven't opened it,
but look at the return address.

31:15.608 --> 31:17.541
"A.R."

31:17.543 --> 31:20.444
And it's addressed to
a postmaster, Mr...

31:20.446 --> 31:21.511
Somebody...
New Salem...

31:21.513 --> 31:23.714
Illinois.

31:24.983 --> 31:26.116
Oh, my goodness.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.317
Yeah.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.352
Probably.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.320
I mean,
talk about a river.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.222
He was rafting
on the Illinois river in 1831

31:32.224 --> 31:33.290
when he hit some rocks.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.424
That's how he ended up
in new Salem,

31:34.426 --> 31:36.226
where he met
a beautiful girl named...

31:36.228 --> 31:37.194
Ann Rutledge.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.195
A.R.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.196
The story goes

31:39.198 --> 31:41.198
they were secretly
engaged to marry.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.600
But nobody knows for sure
because Ann died of typhoid,

31:43.602 --> 31:45.102
and Abraham Lincoln
quit the post office,

31:45.104 --> 31:46.203
and left new Salem forever,

31:46.205 --> 31:47.938
and never
talked about her again.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.273
Now, there are
a lot of theories out there,

31:49.275 --> 31:51.375
but nobody knows for sure
if they were in love.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.911
But now? Well...

31:53.913 --> 31:56.013
We may find out
once and for all.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.823
You know that river
you were talking about?

32:09.694 --> 32:11.762
Do you think you'll ever
get on a raft with anyone again?

32:14.899 --> 32:17.067
I hope so.

32:29.914 --> 32:30.881
Rita!

32:30.883 --> 32:32.883
Hi, hazel!

32:32.885 --> 32:33.984
I just heard.

32:33.986 --> 32:37.054
Miss special delivery.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.588
It couldn't happen to

32:38.590 --> 32:39.823
a nicer government
employee.

32:39.825 --> 32:40.824
Thank you.

32:40.826 --> 32:42.192
It's such a shock,

32:42.194 --> 32:43.860
and I still have
so much to do before I go...

32:43.862 --> 32:46.563
Hey, um,
can I ask you a favor?

32:46.565 --> 32:47.965
Are you heading to Shane's?

32:47.967 --> 32:49.700
Yeah, I'm on my way.

32:49.702 --> 32:51.068
I'm running late.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.036
Could you...?

32:53.038 --> 32:54.972
Oh, sure,
just drop 'em in the box.

32:54.974 --> 32:55.973
You're such
a sweetheart.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.641
All right, well, see ya.

32:57.643 --> 32:58.642
See ya.

33:04.415 --> 33:05.615
Rita?

33:05.617 --> 33:06.583
Hmm?

33:06.585 --> 33:07.651
What are you doing here?

33:07.653 --> 33:08.952
Aren't you
supposed to be in...

33:08.954 --> 33:10.320
I am, and I'm late.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.990
But every year, I've been
in charge of the decorations

33:12.992 --> 33:14.624
for the people with no date
on Valentine's day party,

33:14.626 --> 33:16.226
except that
Norman and I happened,

33:16.228 --> 33:17.694
so I figured,
since you don't have a date,

33:17.696 --> 33:18.662
that maybe you
could just handle it.

33:18.664 --> 33:19.663
I'll handle it.

33:19.665 --> 33:20.764
Oh, great!
They're pretty old,

33:20.766 --> 33:22.699
but I think there's still
one year left in them.

33:22.701 --> 33:23.667
Fine.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.235
But I'm not staying
for the party.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.170
I'm going to the gym,
I'm getting a massage,

33:27.172 --> 33:28.472
and then I'm going home
to eat pizza

33:28.474 --> 33:31.575
while I order
discount designer shoes online.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.176
Oh, my gosh,
I forgot to pack shoes!

33:33.178 --> 33:34.478
Run. I've got it covered.

33:35.481 --> 33:36.446
And have a...

33:36.448 --> 33:37.447
Thank you!

33:56.334 --> 33:58.335
Figures.

34:25.263 --> 34:27.397
<i>Turns out tonight's lecture</i>
<i>at the stamp club</i>

34:27.399 --> 34:29.833
is on "blatant misuses
of postage due."

34:29.835 --> 34:31.501
That's a worthy topic.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.036
And high time, too.

34:33.038 --> 34:34.071
You wanna come?

34:34.072 --> 34:36.072
Uh, well...

34:36.074 --> 34:37.274
You know, Oliver,

34:37.275 --> 34:38.942
there's more to me
than meets the eye.

34:38.944 --> 34:41.178
Oh, I am aware
of that, Norman.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.179
See, I think you wanted
to ask Shane out for dinner,

34:43.181 --> 34:46.049
and then
you chickened out.

34:46.051 --> 34:47.350
Well, for your
information,

34:47.351 --> 34:48.918
and your
information only,

34:48.920 --> 34:51.154
I did, in fact,
mail her a Valentine

34:51.156 --> 34:52.289
with a personal
invitation,

34:52.291 --> 34:54.658
and I am awaiting
her response.

34:54.659 --> 34:55.659
You mailed it?

34:55.661 --> 34:56.893
You couldn't
just ask her?

34:56.895 --> 34:59.162
Well, I wanted to do
something special.

34:59.164 --> 35:00.263
Waiting till
the last minute

35:00.265 --> 35:01.665
is pretty special.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.166
Hope you like veal.

35:07.171 --> 35:09.339
Good morning.

35:09.341 --> 35:10.307
Morning.

35:10.309 --> 35:12.843
Happy Valentine's day.

35:12.845 --> 35:15.145
Oh, Norman, are you
gonna get through it okay?

35:15.147 --> 35:16.513
Oh, yes.

35:16.515 --> 35:17.814
Rita and I have a phone date
after my lecture tonight.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.716
You two are so adorable.

35:19.718 --> 35:20.717
Yeah.

35:20.719 --> 35:21.718
What is this?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.620
Oh.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.590
Apparently, I am now
the entire decorations committee

35:26.592 --> 35:30.060
for the postal workers
without dates party

35:30.062 --> 35:31.595
tonight.

35:31.597 --> 35:33.463
Oh, did you plan
to attend that?

35:33.465 --> 35:34.564
No.

35:34.566 --> 35:35.932
No, no... mm-mm, no. No.

35:35.934 --> 35:38.001
I'm just pinch-hitting for Rita.

35:39.704 --> 35:41.872
So, you have other plans?

35:41.874 --> 35:44.841
Well, "other" is...

35:46.477 --> 35:47.477
What about you?

35:47.479 --> 35:48.445
Well...

35:48.447 --> 35:49.446
Eleanor
in passports said

35:49.448 --> 35:51.515
that the party
is canceled this year

35:51.517 --> 35:54.417
because everybody
got dates.

35:54.419 --> 35:56.786
Terrific.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.389
Everybody has a date tonight.

35:59.391 --> 36:00.724
Oh, and to top it off,

36:00.726 --> 36:03.393
the program I was running
just froze my computer.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.395
Excellent, uh...

36:05.397 --> 36:06.396
Why don't you

36:06.398 --> 36:08.431
get Norman
up to speed,

36:08.433 --> 36:09.900
and I will be
right back.

36:16.541 --> 36:18.441
Um...

36:18.443 --> 36:20.477
So if you're not going
to the party tonight,

36:20.479 --> 36:22.245
does that mean you have a date?

36:22.247 --> 36:24.381
Honestly, Norman,

36:24.383 --> 36:25.749
the pressure to have a date
on Valentine's

36:25.751 --> 36:29.019
is both demoralizing
and demeaning.

36:30.087 --> 36:31.521
But if somebody
were to ask you,

36:31.523 --> 36:32.556
I mean, today,

36:32.558 --> 36:33.557
would you go?

36:33.559 --> 36:34.558
This late?

36:34.560 --> 36:37.294
That would just be insulting.

36:43.067 --> 36:44.367
Hazel...

36:44.369 --> 36:45.435
About that letter?

36:45.437 --> 36:47.170
Oh, you're welcome.
No problem.

36:47.172 --> 36:49.139
She got two Valentine's
cards yesterday,

36:49.141 --> 36:50.240
one from her mother,

36:50.242 --> 36:51.942
and the fat one from you.

36:51.944 --> 36:54.444
You were really pushing it
on the postage, by the way.

36:54.446 --> 36:55.512
Oh, gotta run...

37:01.052 --> 37:02.018
Perfect timing.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.019
We're back
in business.

37:03.021 --> 37:04.321
I'm filtering
for the first name maddie.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.790
Oh, happy to hear it,
Ms. mcinerney.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.825
Did she say anything?

37:08.827 --> 37:10.026
She said
Valentine's is demeaning.

37:12.997 --> 37:14.130
Demeaning?

37:14.132 --> 37:16.066
And anyone who would invite her
at the last minute

37:16.068 --> 37:17.801
would be insulting her...
Something like that.

37:17.803 --> 37:19.169
Insulting?

37:19.171 --> 37:20.237
Maybe she got it,

37:20.239 --> 37:21.671
but just doesn't want
to hurt your feelings.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.340
So, maybe she'll
wait till tomorrow

37:23.342 --> 37:24.374
and then pretend
she didn't get it.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.643
I saw that in a movie.

37:41.025 --> 37:42.025
All right,

37:42.027 --> 37:44.794
I want this
letter situation resolved.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.930
We shall press on,

37:46.932 --> 37:48.164
if you don't mind.

37:51.502 --> 37:54.137
Now, where were we?

37:56.607 --> 37:57.841
Thank you.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.783
"To be honest, maddie,

38:06.785 --> 38:09.953
"I started competing
in these debates every month

38:09.955 --> 38:13.356
just to have something to put
on my college application..."

38:13.358 --> 38:15.725
<i>"But after a while</i>

38:15.727 --> 38:17.294
<i>"I started</i>
<i>looking forward to them</i>

38:17.296 --> 38:19.329
<i>"because it meant seeing you.</i>

38:19.331 --> 38:21.531
<i>"And by the time we made it</i>
<i>to the spring finals,</i>

38:21.533 --> 38:23.967
<i>"just being there</i>

38:23.969 --> 38:25.869
<i>"I felt like I'd already won.</i>

38:25.871 --> 38:27.237
<i>I wish you could believe that. "</i>

38:27.239 --> 38:28.938
How'd it go?

38:28.940 --> 38:31.641
Well...

38:31.643 --> 38:32.676
We qualified.

38:32.678 --> 38:33.677
We did, too!

38:33.679 --> 38:34.911
Good for you!

38:35.913 --> 38:36.913
Hey, ry'.

38:36.915 --> 38:37.914
Hey.

38:37.916 --> 38:38.882
So, it looks like

38:38.884 --> 38:39.883
you're still
in the running.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.251
Looks like it.

38:44.789 --> 38:46.256
See you later.

38:48.793 --> 38:50.126
You know...

38:50.128 --> 38:51.528
If it finally comes down

38:51.530 --> 38:52.562
to you and us
tomorrow,

38:52.564 --> 38:53.563
trust me,

38:53.565 --> 38:55.432
maddie won't back down.

38:55.434 --> 38:56.533
Because I won't let her.

38:58.069 --> 39:01.004
What are you
talking about?

39:01.006 --> 39:03.173
Maddie...

39:03.175 --> 39:04.708
For a really
intelligent girl,

39:04.710 --> 39:07.310
you can be so stupid.

39:07.312 --> 39:08.378
He's been using you.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.713
Hold on...

39:09.715 --> 39:11.414
Last year, Paige booker
was the big threat,

39:11.416 --> 39:12.982
so Ryan got her
spinning so fast,

39:12.984 --> 39:14.117
she couldn't remember
the bill of rights.

39:14.119 --> 39:16.119
He used her,

39:16.121 --> 39:17.253
and now he's using you.

39:17.255 --> 39:19.589
He zeroes in on
the competition,

39:19.591 --> 39:20.657
and if they're
insecure,

39:20.659 --> 39:22.158
he encourages them.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.327
If they're vain,
he compliments them.

39:25.463 --> 39:27.097
If they roller blade,

39:27.099 --> 39:29.032
he learns
how to roller blade, too.

39:31.235 --> 39:33.103
You told me your mom saved up

39:33.105 --> 39:34.904
to buy you those skates
for Christmas.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.273
Okay, it was
like that at first...

39:37.275 --> 39:38.742
I can't believe this...

39:38.744 --> 39:40.076
But you were different.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.978
I mean, we've been
good for each other,

39:41.980 --> 39:43.146
haven't we?

39:51.188 --> 39:52.288
Maddie!

39:52.290 --> 39:53.289
Just listen to me

39:53.291 --> 39:54.424
for one second,
please...

39:54.426 --> 39:56.159
Don't touch me.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.261
I honestly care about you,
and that's a fact.

39:58.263 --> 40:01.631
Since when are you
interested in facts, Ryan?

40:01.633 --> 40:02.866
I'm interested in the truth
because you taught me to be.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.200
Just like I taught you

40:04.202 --> 40:05.902
to argue with your heart
and trust your gut.

40:07.004 --> 40:09.239
So, what is your gut
telling you now?

40:09.241 --> 40:12.041
That I was a fool.

40:13.277 --> 40:14.544
<i>"Who I was when I met you</i>

40:14.546 --> 40:16.746
<i>"is not who I am now, maddie,</i>

40:16.748 --> 40:19.115
<i>"and I was so angry</i>

40:19.117 --> 40:21.584
<i>because I thought</i>
<i>you couldn't see that..."</i>

40:21.586 --> 40:23.820
I could use
that six-pack now.

40:25.790 --> 40:26.956
"If I'd only known last night

40:26.958 --> 40:28.658
"what you were going to say
this morning,

40:28.660 --> 40:30.794
"I would never
have left the hotel.

40:30.796 --> 40:31.795
"But now,

40:31.797 --> 40:33.430
it's too late."

40:34.765 --> 40:35.999
Oh, dear.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.066
Nothing's come up for maddie

40:37.068 --> 40:38.067
or Madeleine.

40:38.069 --> 40:39.436
But now we have a date,

40:39.438 --> 40:41.104
and we know they both competed
in the finals

40:41.106 --> 40:44.374
at the brown palace hotel.

40:44.376 --> 40:45.375
Okay, I can work with that.

40:45.377 --> 40:46.443
Give me a second.

40:49.914 --> 40:51.014
It's quite a mystery,

40:51.016 --> 40:52.749
that letter you have
from new Salem.

40:52.751 --> 40:53.783
Have you read it yet?

40:53.785 --> 40:54.818
Not yet.

40:54.820 --> 40:55.885
I'm taking it slow,

40:55.887 --> 40:58.288
like... postal archeology.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.923
Probably a wise course.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.391
It could be quite a discovery.

41:02.393 --> 41:03.526
Now, how does
something like that

41:03.528 --> 41:06.696
get into a cigar box
in a pawn shop in Denver?

41:06.698 --> 41:10.366
Perhaps the question
isn't "why?" Or "how?"

41:10.368 --> 41:11.668
But "why now?"

41:11.670 --> 41:13.736
Bingo!

41:13.738 --> 41:16.306
The brown has hosted
the tristate finals since 1998.

41:16.308 --> 41:17.507
Hmm.

41:19.444 --> 41:21.244
Oh!

41:21.246 --> 41:22.212
Look at this.

41:22.214 --> 41:25.148
I set up an alert
to notify me

41:25.150 --> 41:26.649
whenever anything
was posted about Rita.

41:27.785 --> 41:29.052
Oh, this looks like

41:29.054 --> 41:30.286
it's her first
press conference.

41:30.288 --> 41:31.754
<i>Yes, it was a big surprise!</i>

41:33.592 --> 41:36.559
<i>I mean, yesterday,</i>
<i>i was sorting mail in Denver.</i>

41:38.062 --> 41:39.028
Yes?

41:39.030 --> 41:40.029
Can you comment
on that tweet of you

41:40.031 --> 41:41.598
kissing
your boyfriend?

41:43.033 --> 41:45.335
<i>Oh... well...</i>

41:47.404 --> 41:49.873
That wasn't a kiss,
and that wasn't my boyfriend.

41:49.875 --> 41:53.543
<i>I mean, he's just a coworker</i>
<i>who had something in his eye.</i>

41:53.545 --> 41:56.012
I don't have a boyfriend.
I'm free as a bird.

41:56.014 --> 41:58.581
<i>Next?</i>

42:18.102 --> 42:19.869
The reservations were
made by the schools,

42:19.871 --> 42:22.305
and they did not keep
records of student names.

42:22.307 --> 42:23.640
What about the schools?

42:23.642 --> 42:24.774
The special events coordinator

42:24.776 --> 42:25.975
is busy with
the Valentine's ball.

42:25.977 --> 42:28.344
She can't get us a list
until Monday.

42:28.346 --> 42:29.946
We can't wait for that.

42:29.948 --> 42:31.748
We have to give Norman
something else to do

42:31.750 --> 42:33.716
besides dismantle the lobby.

42:34.718 --> 42:35.718
Norman?

42:38.122 --> 42:39.622
How are you feeling?

42:45.764 --> 42:47.030
Norman, uh...

42:47.032 --> 42:48.531
Please...

42:48.533 --> 42:50.700
I'm sure Rita

42:50.702 --> 42:52.001
will explain
everything tonight

42:52.003 --> 42:53.002
when you talk.

42:53.004 --> 42:55.138
But right now we
have to focus, okay?

42:56.440 --> 42:58.608
And the heart.

43:11.622 --> 43:12.889
"Have you ever
been so upset,

43:12.891 --> 43:15.425
you don't even know
what you're doing?"

43:16.527 --> 43:18.061
"That's how I felt

43:18.063 --> 43:20.697
last night..."

43:20.699 --> 43:23.466
<i> "It hurt so much,</i>

43:23.468 --> 43:26.536
<i>i just wanted it to stop."</i>

43:53.364 --> 43:55.164
Hey, wake up.

43:56.433 --> 43:57.400
Where have you been?

44:03.340 --> 44:05.008
God, you stink.

44:05.010 --> 44:06.009
What happened?

44:06.011 --> 44:08.978
I hit a trash can.

44:21.492 --> 44:23.326
Are you okay?

44:23.328 --> 44:24.494
I don't know.

44:24.496 --> 44:27.230
I just want to say that
if you meant what you said,

44:27.232 --> 44:28.197
that you care about me,

44:28.199 --> 44:30.433
then whatever
happens today,

44:30.435 --> 44:32.802
I want you to know
that I'm in love with you.

44:34.238 --> 44:35.338
No matter who wins,

44:35.340 --> 44:37.140
I'll be waiting for you
by the tree, and...

44:37.142 --> 44:39.208
I hope we can keep...

44:39.210 --> 44:40.276
Skating.

44:43.047 --> 44:45.348
How's that for speaking
from the heart?

44:50.254 --> 44:51.421
Resolved,

44:51.423 --> 44:53.856
the federal government
should withdraw tax credits...

44:53.858 --> 44:54.824
...non-governmental
organizations

44:54.826 --> 44:56.159
providing programs
for the homeless

44:56.161 --> 44:57.326
that fail to comply with..."

44:57.328 --> 44:59.729
...those who are lost
on the perilous

44:59.731 --> 45:03.199
and lonely journey
of homelessness

45:03.201 --> 45:05.101
have become
too marginalized

45:05.103 --> 45:08.271
to pull themselves back
from invisibility.

45:08.273 --> 45:09.939
<i>If our government by the people</i>
<i>cannot be for the people,</i>

45:09.941 --> 45:11.674
<i>all the people,</i>

45:11.676 --> 45:13.176
<i>then we, too,</i>
<i>have lost our way...</i>

45:16.013 --> 45:18.181
<i>...and we will find ourselves</i>
<i>on that same road</i>

45:18.183 --> 45:20.450
<i>that leads to losing</i>
<i>not only our identity,</i>

45:20.452 --> 45:23.052
<i>but our very existence</i>

45:23.054 --> 45:25.421
as a compassionate
and just nation.

45:42.773 --> 45:43.940
In 1962,

45:43.942 --> 45:49.278
the percentage of homelessness
among Americans was...

45:54.218 --> 45:57.453
I'm sorry,
let me start over.

45:57.455 --> 45:59.388
Homelessness
in this country...

46:01.492 --> 46:02.725
...in America...

46:04.461 --> 46:05.461
...is a new concept...

46:05.463 --> 46:07.830
It's...

46:07.832 --> 46:09.832
I mean, it's not...

46:19.376 --> 46:21.477
<i>"I realized two things</i>

46:21.479 --> 46:24.614
<i>"this morning, maddie.</i>

46:24.616 --> 46:28.317
<i>"That I was responsible for</i>
<i>the death of an innocent person,</i>

46:28.319 --> 46:31.220
<i>"and that I have to take</i>
<i>responsibility for that,</i>

46:31.222 --> 46:33.623
<i>"no matter what that means.</i>

46:33.625 --> 46:36.626
<i>"So instead of meeting you</i>
<i>at our tree today,</i>

46:36.628 --> 46:39.162
<i>"I'm going to turn myself in.</i>

46:39.164 --> 46:41.230
<i>"So I won't be there</i>
<i>to watch you in the finals,</i>

46:41.232 --> 46:44.433
<i>"but at least now</i>
<i>you'll know why.</i>

46:44.435 --> 46:47.270
<i>"This is going to</i>
<i>change my life...</i>

46:47.272 --> 46:49.572
<i>"But I can't let it</i>
<i>change yours,</i>

46:49.574 --> 46:51.073
<i>"and I'll understand</i>

46:51.075 --> 46:54.043
<i>if you don't want to have</i>
<i>anything to do with me again."</i>

46:54.045 --> 46:55.845
<i>"Just remember that</i>

46:55.847 --> 47:00.383
<i>"when you told me you loved me</i>

47:10.861 --> 47:13.362
"Just remember that
when you told me you loved me,

47:13.364 --> 47:15.264
"for one moment today,

47:15.266 --> 47:17.166
"I was truly happy.

47:18.869 --> 47:21.771

I ever am.

47:23.207 --> 47:24.273
"Love, Ryan.

47:24.275 --> 47:26.042
"P.S.

47:26.044 --> 47:28.945
Take good care of your heart."

47:28.947 --> 47:32.048
You know, when I filtered
for a maddie,

47:32.050 --> 47:33.049
I didn't get any hits,

47:33.051 --> 47:36.185
but maybe if I try a Ryan?

47:38.857 --> 47:41.257
I can't imagine what his life
must have been like.

47:41.259 --> 47:43.726
Ruined by one
single mistake.

47:43.728 --> 47:45.027
Not necessarily.

47:45.029 --> 47:46.629
If he was under 18,

47:46.631 --> 47:48.564
then his name would never
have been released.

47:48.566 --> 47:49.799
Nobody would ever know.

47:49.801 --> 47:52.034
Except for us.

47:52.036 --> 47:54.437
I'm not sure we should know.

47:55.739 --> 47:57.807
Let's just...

47:57.809 --> 48:00.810
Keep trying to find maddie.

48:00.812 --> 48:01.944
I think
we just did!

48:05.749 --> 48:08.784
It's not Madeleine,
it's Madison.

48:10.854 --> 48:12.722
There.

48:13.725 --> 48:15.458
I found him!

48:15.460 --> 48:16.759
It's a Ryan...

48:18.295 --> 48:19.295
Oh, wow.

48:19.297 --> 48:20.529
It's...

48:20.531 --> 48:21.998
Ryan hallett.

48:24.868 --> 48:26.869
Governor Ryan hallett.

48:28.171 --> 48:31.340
I suggest we adjourn
for the day,

48:31.342 --> 48:32.742
and resume this
discussion tomorrow.

48:32.744 --> 48:35.111
I'm sure you don't
want to be late to...

48:36.346 --> 48:38.180
Whatever.

48:39.816 --> 48:41.517
Oh, right.

48:41.519 --> 48:42.752
Mm... mm-hmm.

48:44.821 --> 48:46.055
Well, then.

48:46.057 --> 48:47.423
Good evening.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.191
Mm-hmm.

48:49.193 --> 48:51.427
I have my, um,
lecture this evening,

48:51.429 --> 48:52.762
and then Rita's
gonna call, so...

48:52.764 --> 48:54.497
Good night.

48:54.499 --> 48:56.365
Happy, um...

49:05.542 --> 49:07.109
Norman, I really think
you're making

49:07.111 --> 49:10.112
<i>too big a deal out of this.</i>

49:10.114 --> 49:12.515
My girlfriend says that
she doesn't have a boyfriend.

49:12.517 --> 49:13.683
I think that's a big deal.

49:13.685 --> 49:14.951
<i>But why would I want</i>

49:14.953 --> 49:17.253
the whole world
to know about us?

49:17.255 --> 49:19.121
Why wouldn't you?

49:19.123 --> 49:21.390
<i>Because the world is</i>
<i>a different place now, Norman.</i>

49:21.392 --> 49:24.193
I mean, everybody tells
everybody everything.

49:24.195 --> 49:26.062
I mean, they post it,

49:26.064 --> 49:27.163
<i>or they tweet it,</i>

49:27.165 --> 49:28.531
<i>and then it's just out there</i>
<i>forever, and...</i>

49:28.533 --> 49:30.333
Are you saying
that we're not forever?

49:30.335 --> 49:31.867
<i>No...</i>

49:31.869 --> 49:34.170
I'm saying,

49:34.172 --> 49:35.972
this is our life.

49:35.974 --> 49:38.207
We're not somebody's... hashtag.

49:40.178 --> 49:41.944
<i>Look, I'm really tired, Norman.</i>

49:41.946 --> 49:44.046
Can we talk about this
when I get back?

49:44.048 --> 49:45.247
<i>Sure.</i>

49:46.416 --> 49:48.084
I'll see you Monday.

49:48.086 --> 49:49.652
Until then, I guess
you're "free as a bird," huh?

49:49.654 --> 49:50.753

49:50.755 --> 49:51.754

52:37.420 --> 52:38.821
Were you here all night?

52:38.823 --> 52:39.822
Yes?

52:39.824 --> 52:40.890
No.

52:40.892 --> 52:41.991
Well...

52:41.993 --> 52:43.425
What's this?

52:43.427 --> 52:45.461
Oh, uh, that's
the antique card

52:45.463 --> 52:47.396
that serge gave me.

52:47.398 --> 52:48.397
It's beautiful.

52:48.399 --> 52:51.133
It's almost 200 years old.

52:51.135 --> 52:52.168
And all handmade?

52:52.170 --> 52:54.003
Yeah.

52:54.005 --> 52:55.437
Somebody sure did care
about somebody.

52:55.439 --> 52:57.173
Yeah.

52:59.277 --> 53:01.710
Good morning,
everyone.

53:01.712 --> 53:03.312
Norman.

53:04.814 --> 53:05.814
You are...

53:05.816 --> 53:06.849
Not yourself.

53:06.851 --> 53:09.318
I just need a shave.

53:09.320 --> 53:11.420
A gentleman
must never forsake

53:11.422 --> 53:13.255
his morning ablutions.

53:13.257 --> 53:14.657
Do what you must,

53:14.659 --> 53:16.292
and we'll regroup
at the grille

53:16.294 --> 53:18.194
at say, 10:00?

53:18.196 --> 53:19.228
Okay.

53:19.230 --> 53:20.262
Sorry.

53:28.638 --> 53:31.740
So, how was your evening?

53:31.742 --> 53:33.175
Lovely.

53:33.177 --> 53:35.211
Uh, spent it with a...

53:35.213 --> 53:36.212
A friend.

53:36.214 --> 53:37.346
And you?

53:37.348 --> 53:39.715
Oh, it was great.

53:39.717 --> 53:42.084
You know, uh,

53:42.086 --> 53:44.086
wine, candlelight, music.

53:45.755 --> 53:47.323
Ah.

53:47.325 --> 53:49.158
I, um, I did some research,

53:49.160 --> 53:50.526
and there is no record
of the governor

53:50.528 --> 53:51.660
being involved in
a hit-and-run,

53:51.662 --> 53:54.196
or ever having received a dui.

53:54.198 --> 53:56.165
However,

53:56.167 --> 53:58.934
there is a sealed record
for a Ryan t. Hallett

53:58.936 --> 54:00.169
that was filed 15 years ago

54:00.171 --> 54:01.604
with the clerk
of the juvenile court,

54:01.606 --> 54:02.605
which suggests

54:02.607 --> 54:04.073
that whatever he did back then

54:04.075 --> 54:05.074
was expunged,

54:05.076 --> 54:07.076
and that gives him
the legal right to say

54:07.078 --> 54:08.477
he doesn't have
a criminal record.

54:08.479 --> 54:09.478
My goodness.

54:09.480 --> 54:11.146
You did all this,

54:11.148 --> 54:13.949
and still had time
for a candlelight dinner?

54:14.918 --> 54:17.219
I got up early.

54:17.221 --> 54:18.454
Yes, well, impressive.

54:18.456 --> 54:20.789
But the issue is not

54:20.791 --> 54:22.791
governor hallett's
juvenile record.

54:22.793 --> 54:24.994
It is Madison alstrup's
delayed letter.

54:24.996 --> 54:28.530
Well, she was living
in Cheyenne, Wyoming,

54:28.532 --> 54:30.966
and working as a reporter
for the Cheyenne-union post,

54:30.968 --> 54:31.967
until about a year ago,

54:31.969 --> 54:33.002
when she packed up
her apartment,

54:33.004 --> 54:36.005
and left no forwarding address.

54:36.007 --> 54:37.640
I'm sure you'll think of
something, Ms. mcinerney.

54:37.642 --> 54:38.841
Um...

54:38.843 --> 54:40.643
I must attend to Norman.

54:40.645 --> 54:41.910
He seems a bit blue.

54:48.652 --> 54:50.586
Oliver!

54:51.855 --> 54:53.555
Hallett is
a good governor.

54:53.557 --> 54:55.591
Even his opponents
like him.

54:55.593 --> 54:57.126
Whatever he did,

54:57.128 --> 54:59.061
he turned himself in,

54:59.063 --> 55:00.929
and he paid his debt.

55:00.931 --> 55:03.632
If we deliver that letter
to a reporter,

55:03.634 --> 55:05.768
then we're
handing her the power

55:05.770 --> 55:07.503
to destroy a good man

55:07.505 --> 55:11.040
who was once just a stupid,
broken-hearted boy.

55:12.475 --> 55:15.077
What happens after we deliver
the letter to Ms. alstrup

55:15.079 --> 55:17.579
is between Ms. alstrup
and her conscience.

55:17.581 --> 55:19.415
Ah... ah-hah.

55:19.417 --> 55:20.416
Ah-hah?

55:20.418 --> 55:22.418
Well, this is about
your conscience.

55:22.420 --> 55:25.688
That lady cop that
you had a crush on,

55:25.690 --> 55:26.722
you haven't seen her
in 15 years,

55:26.724 --> 55:28.324
and it still bothers you

55:28.326 --> 55:29.558
that you allowed her
to get in the way

55:29.560 --> 55:31.827
of performing your duties
in a timely manner.

55:33.663 --> 55:34.630
Rita's right.

55:34.632 --> 55:36.265
I really am starting
to sound like you.

55:36.267 --> 55:39.001
Please keep me informed
of your progress.

55:39.003 --> 55:42.004
There must be something in here
we are missing.

55:43.606 --> 55:45.507
Oh, and the police officer.

55:45.509 --> 55:48.243
I never said I haven't
seen her since.

55:51.581 --> 55:55.918
I'm still unclear
how this got so out of hand.

55:55.920 --> 55:56.919
Somebody took
a selfie with us

55:56.921 --> 55:58.354
and tweeted it,

55:58.356 --> 55:59.355
and somebody else
posted it,

55:59.357 --> 56:00.422
and somebody
else pinned it,

56:00.424 --> 56:01.423
and before
you know it,

56:01.425 --> 56:04.360
Rita's gone viral
with her own hashtag.

56:04.362 --> 56:06.228
I have no idea
what you are talking about,

56:06.230 --> 56:09.231
but, uh, I am outraged.

56:09.233 --> 56:11.467
So was Rita,
I guess.

56:11.469 --> 56:12.601
But when you're in love,

56:12.603 --> 56:15.204
don't you want to just
shout it out to the world?

56:15.206 --> 56:16.438
Of course.

56:16.440 --> 56:17.439
For some reason,

56:17.441 --> 56:21.477
strangers have chosen
to shout it for you.

56:21.479 --> 56:23.278
You know what
her hashtag is?

56:23.280 --> 56:25.147
Norman, please.

56:25.149 --> 56:27.249
Let's, uh, not go there.

56:36.259 --> 56:38.627
Can I help you?

56:38.629 --> 56:40.396
Yes, I'm Shane mcinerney.
I called from...

56:40.398 --> 56:41.430
The post office.

56:41.432 --> 56:42.564
Right.

56:42.566 --> 56:43.532
I'm Becca.

56:43.534 --> 56:44.566
Hi.

56:44.568 --> 56:46.368
Hi.

56:47.804 --> 56:49.238
She never married.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.272
She worked in Cheyenne

56:50.274 --> 56:51.273
until last year

56:51.275 --> 56:52.274
when she got sick,

56:52.276 --> 56:54.309
and Becca convinced her
to come down to Denver

56:54.311 --> 56:55.377
to see a specialist,

56:55.379 --> 56:58.280
and she never left.

56:58.282 --> 57:00.516
Good work,
Ms. mcinerney.

57:00.518 --> 57:02.518
Oliver,
I did my job,

57:02.520 --> 57:04.119
but can we just
think this through

57:04.121 --> 57:05.354
before we deliver this?

57:05.356 --> 57:08.056
If Ms. alstrup is
as sick as it sounds,

57:08.058 --> 57:09.324
she is highly
unlikely

57:09.326 --> 57:11.360
to create
a political scandal.

57:11.362 --> 57:12.528
I agree,

57:12.530 --> 57:14.096
but what Ryan says
in that letter

57:14.098 --> 57:15.597
could still be
pretty shocking.

57:15.599 --> 57:18.000
It's the last thing
she needs.

57:18.002 --> 57:20.402
What good could come
of this, really?

57:20.404 --> 57:21.670
Well, I think...

57:21.672 --> 57:23.472
It's always good to know
that you were loved,

57:23.474 --> 57:26.108
isn't it?

57:29.312 --> 57:30.412
May I help you?

57:30.414 --> 57:31.613
Yes, please, my name
is Oliver O'Toole.

57:31.615 --> 57:33.415
My colleagues and I were
hoping for a moment

57:33.417 --> 57:35.050
with Ms. Madison alstrup.

57:35.052 --> 57:36.618
She's not taking visitors.

57:36.620 --> 57:39.455
Oh, we don't want
to disturb her.

57:39.457 --> 57:41.323
Good, 'cause you won't.

57:43.092 --> 57:44.560
We do need

57:44.562 --> 57:47.362
to deliver this to her
briefly in person.

57:47.364 --> 57:48.430
We don't all
have to go in,

57:48.432 --> 57:49.998
just one of us.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.634
How about none of you?

57:52.636 --> 57:53.635
But we're from

57:53.637 --> 57:54.636
the United States
post office

57:54.638 --> 57:55.637
on official business.

57:55.639 --> 57:56.972
Honey, you could be
the governor of Colorado

57:56.974 --> 57:58.106
on official business,

57:58.108 --> 57:59.575
and you still wouldn't
get by me.

58:07.250 --> 58:08.283
He's almost finished.

58:08.285 --> 58:10.085
Thank you.

58:10.087 --> 58:11.520
I bet you guys
were busy this week.

58:11.522 --> 58:13.388
All those
valentines, right?

58:13.390 --> 58:15.023
350,000.

58:15.025 --> 58:18.060
And not one of them
was for me.

58:18.062 --> 58:20.529
There you go.
I'll see you Tuesday.

58:20.531 --> 58:23.499
Ricky, you hang in there, okay?

58:23.501 --> 58:24.600
Governor,

58:24.602 --> 58:27.035
these are the folks
from the post office.

58:27.037 --> 58:28.370
Hi, I'm Ryan.

58:28.372 --> 58:29.538
Governor,
I'm Oliver O'Toole,

58:29.540 --> 58:31.073
this is
Ms. Shane mcinerney.

58:31.075 --> 58:32.107
Hi. Thank you
for fitting us in.

58:32.109 --> 58:33.375
Oh, of course.

58:33.377 --> 58:34.443
So, I understand

58:34.445 --> 58:36.044
you have some kind of
a special delivery

58:36.046 --> 58:37.179
for me?

58:37.181 --> 58:39.414
Actually, we were hoping
you might deliver it for us.

58:39.416 --> 58:41.550
It was damaged

58:41.552 --> 58:43.051
when the mailbox
you dropped it in

58:43.053 --> 58:44.920
exploded.

58:50.159 --> 58:51.894
That was 15 years ago.

58:51.896 --> 58:52.928
Yes,

58:52.930 --> 58:53.996
but once it's mailed,

58:53.998 --> 58:55.264
we are still required
to deliver it

58:55.266 --> 58:56.231
to the name on the envelope.

58:56.233 --> 58:58.800
Of course.

58:58.802 --> 59:00.002
Governor,
it was necessary

59:00.004 --> 59:02.137
for us to read the letter

59:02.139 --> 59:03.805
in order to process it.

59:06.309 --> 59:07.342
Can you give us some time?

59:20.390 --> 59:21.990
So you know...

59:21.992 --> 59:22.991
Yes.

59:24.460 --> 59:28.297
Nothing can explain
or excuse what I did.

59:28.299 --> 59:30.032
He was homeless.

59:30.034 --> 59:32.834
No friends,
no family.

59:32.836 --> 59:34.736
There was no one
to even miss him,

59:34.738 --> 59:38.273
or to apologize to.

59:38.275 --> 59:39.675
He was never
identified.

59:39.677 --> 59:40.776
A man,

59:40.778 --> 59:41.910
just as alive as any of us,

59:41.912 --> 59:43.111
trying to do the best he could,

59:43.113 --> 59:45.180
and in a one moment...

59:45.182 --> 59:46.748
He was gone.

59:48.217 --> 59:50.285
I was a minor,
so it never came out,

59:50.287 --> 59:53.722
but I never took another drink,

59:53.724 --> 59:55.891
and I decided to spend
the rest of my life

59:55.893 --> 59:57.359
trying to make up for
what I did,

59:57.361 --> 01:00:00.195
but you never
really can.

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:03.765
I can understand that.

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:08.904
I always suspected
that this was out there,

01:00:08.906 --> 01:00:10.606
and that maddie
might show up one day,

01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:12.207
blow the whistle on me.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.610
Now I know why
she never did.

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:17.045
For all she knew,

01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:19.147
I was only guilty
of being a user and a liar.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.718
And for all I knew,

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.855
she'd read this and decided
that I wasn't worth the trouble.

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:29.257
It's funny, you know,

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:31.059
how two people
who care about each other

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:32.594
so much

01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:34.896
can let all their insecurities
get in the way

01:00:34.898 --> 01:00:36.698
and completely get it wrong.

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:41.503
I'll bet she hates me now.

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:45.607
Uh, actually, governor,

01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:48.076
I believe
she needs you now.

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.054
What have you got there?

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:02.824
Oh, uh...

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.831
It's kind of
a Valentine love letter.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.433
Well, of course,
it's a love letter.

01:01:11.435 --> 01:01:13.669
Look at those two
little people kissing.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:15.737
It was mailed in 1835.

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:20.676
Just the fact that it exists
could rewrite American history.

01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:21.677
One day, you're spilling
your heart out

01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:22.678
to your one and only,

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.679
and a couple of centuries later,

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:24.713
the whole world is reading

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:28.083
what was only meant
for the two of you.

01:01:28.085 --> 01:01:29.084
Yeah...

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:32.421
What's happened to the world?

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:36.725
You put that away before
something happens to it.

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:37.693
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:46.668
And you're still
not getting in there.

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:49.004
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:52.641
Sometimes,
Ms. mcinerney,

01:01:52.643 --> 01:01:55.510
you are a complete
mystery to me.

01:01:55.512 --> 01:01:56.945
Sometimes?

01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:57.946
Why would you
lie to someone

01:01:57.948 --> 01:02:00.348
about not receiving
any valentines?

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:01.717
That wasn't a lie.

01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:02.984
Oh, please,
Ms. mcinerney,

01:02:02.986 --> 01:02:04.319
if for whatever reason

01:02:04.321 --> 01:02:05.554
you were too
uncomfortable

01:02:05.556 --> 01:02:07.422
to decline
the invitation

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:09.291
in person,

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:11.960
you might try leaving
your mother out

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:14.796
of your rather sad
attempts to dissemble.

01:02:14.798 --> 01:02:17.933
Oliver, I have no idea
what you are talking about.

01:02:17.935 --> 01:02:21.470
I'm talking about
dinner last night.

01:02:21.472 --> 01:02:23.205
Okay.

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:24.406
I lied.

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:26.174
I didn't have a date.

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:28.643
But I didn't lie about
getting any valentines.

01:02:28.645 --> 01:02:30.479
I didn't receive
a single one this year,

01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:32.681
not even from my mother,
by the way.

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:37.319
And you're one to talk.

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:39.588
You said you spent the evening
with a friend.

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:42.257
Well, if one cannot be
one's own friend, then...

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:44.159
Then...

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:45.527
Wait, how did you know?

01:02:45.529 --> 01:02:47.596
And please don't
change the subject.

01:02:47.598 --> 01:02:49.865
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
what are we even talking about?

01:02:49.867 --> 01:02:51.533
We're...

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:07.516
Governor hallett,

01:03:07.518 --> 01:03:09.084
this is our colleague,
Norman dorman.

01:03:09.086 --> 01:03:11.119
Dorman.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.254
And this is...

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:14.222
May I help you... governor?

01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:17.526
I understand Madison alstrup
is a patient here?

01:03:17.528 --> 01:03:18.760
She is.

01:03:18.762 --> 01:03:22.063
But I can't give you
her medical information.

01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:23.532
You don't have to.

01:03:23.534 --> 01:03:24.599
I know.

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:28.336
When we were teenagers,

01:03:28.338 --> 01:03:30.639
she told me that she had
a congenital heart defect.

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:34.276
"P.S.

01:03:34.278 --> 01:03:35.510
Take good care of your heart."

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:43.351
I understand
that she doesn't want visitors.

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:46.121
Well, folks like this,

01:03:46.123 --> 01:03:47.689
getting ready to go,

01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:50.492
it's not that
they don't want visitors,

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:52.661
it's they don't want
just any visitor.

01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:55.630
And governor,
you're not just any visitor.

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:00.402
Sir?

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:08.376
I want to tell her the truth,

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:10.111
and I want to tell her
I'm sorry.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:16.184
I just don't know
how to tell her goodbye.

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:22.257
Uh...

01:04:22.259 --> 01:04:23.291
Um...

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:28.230
When Abraham Lincoln
was 26 years old,

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:29.297
he went to visit a woman

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:34.035
who may or may not
have been his fiancee.

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:36.404
Nobody's ever been
able to prove it.

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:38.006
We do know that

01:04:38.008 --> 01:04:39.407
that she was
dying of typhoid,

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:41.142
so he had gone
to say goodbye to her.

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:43.945
Nobody knows what they said
to each other that day,

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:44.946
but after he left,

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:45.981
he was never
the same again.

01:04:45.983 --> 01:04:47.449
- Norman...
- She told him...

01:04:47.451 --> 01:04:49.784
Well, I like to think

01:04:49.786 --> 01:04:54.155
that she told him
not to dwell in the past,

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:57.058
or blame himself for
what he couldn't change.

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:02.731
And no one could ever understand
the special bond that they had,

01:05:02.733 --> 01:05:06.034
and I think that
she told him

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:07.969
that none of it would matter

01:05:07.971 --> 01:05:10.205
if he didn't carry on
after she was gone.

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:14.142
And, I guess
we both know,

01:05:14.144 --> 01:05:17.679
that he did.

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:30.191
That girl.

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:32.861
I'm guessing
she died around...

01:05:32.863 --> 01:05:34.729
1835?

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:36.731
Yes, ma'am.

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.889
Where is he?

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:38.927
Norman could get lost
in an elevator

01:06:38.929 --> 01:06:41.863
when Rita isn't around.

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:45.133
Oliver...

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:46.234
Hmm?

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:51.373
You know, if it weren't
for you being, well, you,

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:54.642
that letter might not have
been delivered in time.

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:55.777
If it weren't for me,

01:06:55.779 --> 01:06:58.113
that letter would have
been delivered 15 years ago,

01:06:58.115 --> 01:07:00.181
exactly on time.

01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:01.716
But you always say

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:03.985
that God moves
in mysterious ways, right?

01:07:05.888 --> 01:07:06.955
Oh, that reminds me,

01:07:06.957 --> 01:07:08.957
I almost forgot...

01:07:08.959 --> 01:07:10.992
I have choir practice
in half an hour.

01:07:10.994 --> 01:07:11.993
You and Norman
can take the car

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:13.228
back to the dlo,

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:14.596
I'll walk.

01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:17.232
The church is just
down the street.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:19.868
Oliver!

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:22.570
You know
I wasn't lying

01:07:22.572 --> 01:07:24.773
when I said I didn't get
any valentines,

01:07:24.775 --> 01:07:25.940
right?

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:31.880
Have a good weekend,
Ms. mcinerney.

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:41.456
How's Rita?

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:42.524
I saw her on TV.

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:45.660
She looked pretty happy.

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:47.762
She loves you, Norman,

01:07:47.764 --> 01:07:50.532
and you love her.

01:07:50.534 --> 01:07:54.169
Look, we both missed out
on a nice dinner last night,

01:07:54.171 --> 01:07:57.605
so what do you say
we close up,

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:59.908
and we go grab something?

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:01.009
Oh, that sounds...

01:08:01.011 --> 01:08:03.945
Wait, you didn't go out
with Oliver yesterday?

01:08:03.947 --> 01:08:05.380
No.

01:08:05.382 --> 01:08:06.815
How come?

01:08:06.817 --> 01:08:08.750
He didn't invite me.

01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:09.751
Yes, he did.

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:10.718
No. No, he didn't.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.722
What about the
Valentine he sent you?

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.890
Am I losing my mind?

01:08:16.893 --> 01:08:19.894
I didn't get any valentines!

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:24.631
Something's weird.

01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:25.867
Hazel!

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:28.470
Hazel...

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:30.337
Do you remember
delivering any valentines

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.805
to my house this week?

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:33.741
Besides the one
from your mother?

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:35.944
And the other one from...

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:37.011
Well, you know.

01:08:37.013 --> 01:08:38.880
No, I don't know.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:39.881
I never got them.

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:40.948
Of course you did.

01:08:40.951 --> 01:08:42.951
I gave them to Rita,
and we put them in the...

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:43.917
Uh-oh.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.420
Uh-oh?

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:48.389
She was carrying a box and...

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.024
The decorations!

01:08:51.027 --> 01:08:53.495
Rita promised
that she'd give them...

01:08:53.497 --> 01:08:54.496
Norman!

01:08:57.765 --> 01:08:58.765
Ha!

01:08:58.768 --> 01:08:59.968
You wake up in the morning,

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:01.336
and you never really know
how your day is going to end.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:02.337
Focus, Norman.

01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:03.438
It's a plain
cardboard box

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.874
with a bunch of valentines
decorations in it.

01:09:05.876 --> 01:09:07.809
What, like crepe paper
and hearts and stuff?

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:08.810
I don't know,

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:09.911
I never opened it.

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:11.712
Rita said that
it was all pretty old

01:09:11.715 --> 01:09:13.481
and I just...

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:14.515
Hey, hearts

01:09:14.518 --> 01:09:15.550
and crepe paper
and stuff!

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:16.885
Yes! That's it!

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:37.171
"Dear Ms. mcinerney,

01:09:37.174 --> 01:09:39.307
"I've been thinking
that Valentine's day

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:41.676
"might present
the perfect opportunity

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:43.478
"for our long-promised dinner.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.580
I have reservations at..."

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:47.081
"Montaldo's...

01:09:48.216 --> 01:09:49.417
"...a lovely spot

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:52.554
"where we might share
some stimulating conversation

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:53.654
"and enjoy the music.

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:58.393
"It has been a long time
since we danced.

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:01.663
"Awaiting your response,

01:10:01.665 --> 01:10:05.366
sincerely, Oliver O'Toole."

01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:09.671
He thought that I...

01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:11.773
And I thought that he...

01:10:11.775 --> 01:10:13.007
And look,
it's handmade.

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:16.344
Somebody really cares
about somebody.

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:18.980
Oh, Norman, I...

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:22.183
Go on.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:51.879
Why aren't you in...?

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:58.886
"I missed you."

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.494
"I couldn't wait
until Monday."

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:13.134
"I took the first flight back."

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:18.106
No, I'm sorry.

01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:20.475
I should have known you were
just protecting what we have.

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:23.144
It's just...

01:11:23.146 --> 01:11:24.379
You were there

01:11:24.381 --> 01:11:27.215
with those important,
sophisticated postal executives,

01:11:27.217 --> 01:11:28.883
and I just felt...

01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:32.787
I just thought...

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:34.088
I just thought I lost you.

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:41.062
Norman...

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:43.231
That's impossible.

01:11:43.233 --> 01:11:47.502
Wherever I go,
I will always carry you with me.

01:11:58.113 --> 01:12:00.181
I want you on my raft.

01:12:00.183 --> 01:12:03.685
Aw...

01:12:03.687 --> 01:12:07.355
Wait, what on earth
does that mean?

01:12:07.357 --> 01:12:10.091
I love you.

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:13.728
I love you, too.

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:43.224
Maddie.

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.728
Hey.

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:48.930
It's Ryan.

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:52.266
Ryan?

01:12:57.639 --> 01:13:00.141
It's been so...

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:04.245
I waited.

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.915
What happened?

01:13:07.917 --> 01:13:10.818
It's a long story.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:15.056
No stories,
just the facts, right?

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.695
Well, this story
you gotta hear.

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:06.774
Very nice!

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:08.609
Okay, we'll see you
on Sunday.

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:14.315
You were so good today.

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:16.017
Wow, that was
really fun.

01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:17.618
That was wonderful.
You were great.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:18.986
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:19.987
Little nervous.

01:14:19.989 --> 01:14:21.456
I ran in late.
I almost didn't make it

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:23.391
- I was in such a...
- Why? What happened?

01:14:23.393 --> 01:14:25.560
Ms. mcinerney?

01:14:25.562 --> 01:14:26.561
Oh, my goodness.

01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:28.896
What a surprise.

01:14:28.898 --> 01:14:30.565
This is Dale,
uh, Travers,

01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:32.700
Dale, this is
Shane mcinerney.

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:34.869
We work together at
the dead letter office.

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:36.971
Wow! It's nice
to meet you, Shane.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.740
I don't think I've met any
of Oliver's friends from work.

01:14:39.742 --> 01:14:43.344
Well, I don't usually
get to... church.

01:14:43.346 --> 01:14:44.545
You should come sometime.

01:14:45.849 --> 01:14:47.982
Have you ever heard
Oliver sing?

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:48.983
Yes.

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:51.018
No.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.053
Well, sort of.

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.690
Not, um, here.

01:14:56.693 --> 01:14:57.758
Well, you're really
missing something.

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:00.928
I've got to get to work.

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:02.697
Late shift.

01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:04.031
It was so nice
to meet you.

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:05.032
Goodnight.

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:06.033
Bye.

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:12.507
She's, uh... a soprano.

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:14.542
Ah.

01:15:14.544 --> 01:15:16.043
So, what brings you here?

01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:17.645
Oh.

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:18.880
Uh...

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:25.453
I just found it.

01:15:25.455 --> 01:15:27.455
Hazel had given
my valentines to Rita,

01:15:27.457 --> 01:15:30.725
and Rita put them
in a box, and...

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:40.635
Am I... too late for dinner?

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:49.710
"Just remember that

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:52.413
"when you told me
you loved me,

01:15:52.415 --> 01:15:53.614
"for one moment today,

01:15:53.616 --> 01:15:58.719
"I was truly happy.

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:01.622
"It may be the last time
I ever am.

01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:03.591
"Love, Ryan.

01:16:03.593 --> 01:16:06.260
"P.S.

01:16:06.262 --> 01:16:10.264
Take good care
of your heart."

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:19.340
So...

01:16:19.342 --> 01:16:21.542
You loved me.

01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:25.546
I loved you.

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:28.449
I tried.

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:33.621
I tried to take care
of my heart, but...

01:16:33.623 --> 01:16:36.691
I'm sorry that
I wasn't there to help.

01:16:38.126 --> 01:16:39.627
What happened to the man?

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:45.199
When I got out of
juvenile hall,

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:47.735
I tried to find out about him,

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:49.103
but nobody knew anything

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:51.472
except that his body was still
at the county morgue,

01:16:51.474 --> 01:16:52.673
waiting to be claimed.

01:16:52.675 --> 01:16:55.109
I watched,
and I waited, and...

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:56.811
Nothing.

01:16:56.813 --> 01:16:57.878
So, two years later,

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.481
they let me
claim his ashes,

01:17:00.483 --> 01:17:03.751
and one beautiful
Saturday afternoon,

01:17:03.753 --> 01:17:07.154
I took his ashes to our tree,

01:17:07.156 --> 01:17:08.689
and I asked for forgiveness,

01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:10.825
and I made
a promise to him

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:11.826
that I'd never forget

01:17:11.828 --> 01:17:15.663
that I'd been given
another chance

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:17.198
to change my life,

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.434
and I'd taken away his chance
to do the same thing.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:24.905
He died on the 23rd
of the month,

01:17:24.907 --> 01:17:28.509
so every month,
on the 23rd,

01:17:28.511 --> 01:17:30.845
no matter what,

01:17:30.847 --> 01:17:33.714
I make sure to get back there,

01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:35.683
back to that tree,
and to him,

01:17:35.685 --> 01:17:37.451
and I...

01:17:37.453 --> 01:17:38.486
Say a prayer.

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:44.358
I'm still trying to
forgive myself, maddie.

01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:49.630
But, you know, when I'm there,

01:17:49.632 --> 01:17:53.467
somehow, I...

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:56.370
Somehow, I do feel forgiven.

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:05.279
You made
that Valentine.

01:18:05.281 --> 01:18:08.382
All by myself.

01:18:08.384 --> 01:18:10.184
The heart
was a little...

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:12.319
It's perfect.

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:16.290
I haven't gotten
a homemade Valentine

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:18.893
since Joe cook made me one
in the second grade.

01:18:20.495 --> 01:18:22.630
He ran up to me
on the playground,

01:18:22.632 --> 01:18:24.398
shoved it in my hand,

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.667
and punched me in the shoulder.

01:18:28.738 --> 01:18:32.540
Well, then this must have been
something of a letdown.

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:36.243
No.

01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:37.978
Not at all.

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:40.981
I just wish...

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:46.620
Why didn't you just say

01:18:46.622 --> 01:18:49.457
"hey, Shane,
did you get my invitation?"

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:55.696
Well, um, a gentlemen
never makes assumptions

01:18:55.698 --> 01:18:57.998
about a lady's affairs.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.301
But I didn't have any...

01:19:00.303 --> 01:19:01.469
Affair.

01:19:01.471 --> 01:19:03.237
I got a massage, a pizza,

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:05.239
and I took
a very long jog

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:06.474
that happened
to take me

01:19:06.476 --> 01:19:09.744
past a...

01:19:09.746 --> 01:19:12.480
Gentleman's window,

01:19:12.482 --> 01:19:15.483
as he sat by candlelight

01:19:15.485 --> 01:19:16.951
reading a book

01:19:16.953 --> 01:19:20.588
with music
and a glass of wine.

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:22.389
Hmm.

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:23.858
I know.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:28.395
I know it was
a childish thing to do.

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:32.299
Or perhaps we're just finally
old enough to know

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:33.667
that sometimes

01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:36.337
matters of the heart
can hurt more than...

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.406
Than a punch in the shoulder.

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.277
Precisely.

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:51.652
I'm sorry, Oliver.

01:19:54.389 --> 01:19:57.358
I'm sorry, too.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.359
Shane.

01:20:09.906 --> 01:20:11.338
So, is this

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:12.706
the stimulating
conversation

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:14.441
that you were
hoping for?

01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:15.709
Of course, mm-hmm.

01:20:15.711 --> 01:20:19.380
What were those
four aspects of love

01:20:19.382 --> 01:20:21.382
as defined by the greeks?

01:20:21.384 --> 01:20:23.350
There's philos,

01:20:23.352 --> 01:20:25.519
or "brotherly love."

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:26.754
Storge, of course,

01:20:26.756 --> 01:20:28.823
which is sort of family...

01:20:28.825 --> 01:20:30.991
Well, a postable kind of love,

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:32.526
and then there's...

01:20:32.528 --> 01:20:34.595
Let's just cut to the chase.

01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:35.796
Which one can we dance to?

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:14.902
So, about that soprano,

01:21:14.904 --> 01:21:16.370
Dale?

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:17.638
Oh, yes...

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.673
What about her?

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:23.544
How long have
you known her?

01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:28.549
Uh... 15, maybe 16 years.

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:31.585
Hmm.

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:32.720
What does she do?

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:33.888
Oh, she's, uh...

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:36.490
She's a police officer.

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:55.643
"The water is wide

01:21:55.645 --> 01:21:58.178
"I cannot cross o'er

01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:02.917
"and neither have I
the wings to fly

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:04.051
"give us a boat

01:22:04.053 --> 01:22:07.554
"that can carry two

01:22:07.556 --> 01:22:09.957
"and both shall row

01:22:09.959 --> 01:22:12.960
to yonder side..."

01:22:18.467 --> 01:22:20.034
<i>"And so, my love,</i>

01:22:20.036 --> 01:22:23.537
<i>"may these words explain all</i>

01:22:23.539 --> 01:22:26.040
<i>"and bring to you, if not joy,</i>

01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:29.076

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:36.016
<i>"And remember,</i>

01:22:36.018 --> 01:22:38.953
<i>"but there is always joy</i>

01:22:38.955 --> 01:22:41.488
<i>"and always the promise</i>

01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:44.558
<i>"if we will but believe in it.</i>

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.859
<i>"Think of me sometimes</i>

01:22:45.861 --> 01:22:49.063

01:22:49.065 --> 01:22:52.066
<i>"putting on all the love</i>
