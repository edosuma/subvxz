00:08.167 --> 00:12.133
- [sirens wailing]
- PHOEBE: Run!

00:12.233 --> 00:15.367
- [alarm blaring]

00:15.467 --> 00:17.867
- Wait for me!
- I got ya, buddy!

00:17.967 --> 00:21.267
No-o-o-o-o-o!

00:21.367 --> 00:25.867
- COLOSSO NARRATING: That's me,
your old pal Dr. Colosso.

00:25.967 --> 00:27.800
How did I end up like this?

00:27.900 --> 00:30.733
Well, it all started out like
any other normal day.

00:30.833 --> 00:33.467
- [doorbell ringing]

00:33.567 --> 00:37.433
- Phoebe, I really
need your help!!

00:37.533 --> 00:40.333
- Okay, you're talking loud,
so you must be nervous.

00:40.433 --> 00:42.900
Oh, my gosh,
Joey finally asked you out!

00:43.000 --> 00:46.100
- And now we're meeting
for pizza at 2:00!!

00:46.200 --> 00:47.867
What do I do?!!

00:47.967 --> 00:51.733
- Okay, relax.
Let's clap this out.

00:51.833 --> 00:53.233
Calm down.
You're with your bestie.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.900
Just remember--
he's only a boy.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.700
He's just as
nervous as you are.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.567
And your hair is tote of it.

01:00.867 --> 01:02.267
Better?
- [sighing] Thank you.

01:02.367 --> 01:04.300
I always feel better
when you're around.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.133
[gasping]
You should come with me.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.067
- Wouldn't Joey think
that's weird?

01:09.133 --> 01:11.400
- Not as weird as
shattering his eardrums.

01:11.500 --> 01:14.533
I'll have him invite
his best friend.

01:14.633 --> 01:17.233
- Neil? The one who only
eats blender food?

01:17.333 --> 01:19.100
- Hey, you haven't lived

01:19.200 --> 01:21.100
until you've had one
of his cheeseburger milkshakes.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.733
- Actually, I think I'm alive

01:22.833 --> 01:26.067
because I haven't had one of his
cheeseburger milkshakes.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.067
- Please, Phoebe,
I have been crushing on Joey

01:28.167 --> 01:32.233
ever since my second time
through the fourth grade.

01:32.333 --> 01:34.333
- All right. Fine.

01:34.433 --> 01:36.533
If it means that much to you,
I will be there.

01:36.633 --> 01:40.567
- Really? Oh, you're
the best friend ever!

01:40.667 --> 01:41.867
- I don't know this move.

01:41.967 --> 01:44.300
- Thank you!
I'll see you at Wong's.

01:47.533 --> 01:50.967
- Hey, Dad, will you put
together my new dollhouse today?

01:51.067 --> 01:52.533
It's only 500 pieces.

01:52.633 --> 01:57.067
- Oh, I can think of 500 reasons
why I don't wanna do that.

01:57.167 --> 02:00.100
- Please, Daddy? For me.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.900
- Oh, ho, ho, ho.

02:02.067 --> 02:04.567
How can I say "No"
to my baby girl?

02:04.667 --> 02:05.933
[kissing]

02:06.067 --> 02:07.433
- How do you do that?

02:07.533 --> 02:11.167
- Cuteness is
my other superpower.

02:11.267 --> 02:13.433
- Oh, isn't it
a beautiful morning?

02:13.533 --> 02:16.067
The sun is shining,
the birds are singing,

02:16.100 --> 02:18.967
[powers zapping]
Oh!

02:19.067 --> 02:21.967
- Mom's nuking
the coffee maker.

02:22.067 --> 02:23.200
- Are you feeling okay, Barb?

02:23.300 --> 02:26.600
- Yeah, just a weird
little power surge.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.500
I guess I'll have
some toast, instead.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.300
[powers zapping]

02:31.400 --> 02:35.467
- And there goes the toaster.

02:35.567 --> 02:38.733
- Why is Mom destroying
the kitchen?

02:38.833 --> 02:41.133
- I'm probably just
coming down with a cold.

02:41.233 --> 02:45.300
- Let's do a quick body scan
just to be sure.

02:45.400 --> 02:51.133
- [computer scan humming]

02:51.233 --> 02:53.767
- Is Mom okay, Dad?
- Of course she is, Billy.

02:53.867 --> 02:55.467
There's three explanations

02:55.567 --> 02:57.300
for why your Mom's
getting power surges--

02:57.400 --> 02:58.500
a simple head cold,

02:58.600 --> 03:02.267
a disturbance
in the stratosphere or...

03:02.367 --> 03:03.533
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Congratulations.

03:03.633 --> 03:06.867
Barb Thunderman is pregnant.

03:10.167 --> 03:13.533
- Ohhhh...
[heavy thud]

03:13.633 --> 03:17.533
- COMPUTER VOICE: And Hank
Thunderman has passed out.

03:17.633 --> 03:25.267
- *

03:27.867 --> 03:29.933
- Oh, my gosh, Mom,
you're having a baby!

03:30.067 --> 03:31.300
I can't believe it.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.167
- Sometimes these things
aren't accurate.

03:34.267 --> 03:37.633
Your Mom did have
a big burrito last night.

03:37.733 --> 03:40.200
Let's give it one more go.

03:40.300 --> 03:43.567
- [computer scan humming]

03:43.667 --> 03:46.167
- COMPUTER VOICE:
Barb Thunderman--still pregnant.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.867
- NORA: Yay!
- HANK: [laughing]

03:48.967 --> 03:50.400
- How do you feel, Mom?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.400
- I'm happy and kind
of in shock.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.267
[powers zapping]
- HANK: [gasping]

03:54.367 --> 03:56.133
- Sorry, Hank.
I'll get you an ice pack.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.067
- All right, there's
no time to waste.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.667
We need diapers, wipes...

03:59.767 --> 04:01.933
Oh, everybody come up
with baby names.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.133
No fruits or states.

04:03.233 --> 04:04.333
- Are tomatoes a fruit?

04:04.433 --> 04:08.833
'Cause I'm thinking
"Tomato" Thunderman.

04:08.933 --> 04:11.400
- I don't get it.
What's the rush?

04:11.500 --> 04:12.933
We have nine months.

04:13.067 --> 04:16.133
- Actually, superhero babies
come a little sooner than that.

04:16.233 --> 04:17.700
- How soon are we talkin'?

04:17.800 --> 04:20.633
A couple of months?
A few weeks?

04:22.900 --> 04:25.133
- Today.

04:25.233 --> 04:26.833
- We need to start
packing, Hank.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.700
- Guys, you watch
Billy and Nora

04:28.800 --> 04:30.700
while I take your Mom to the
Metroburg Superhero Hospital.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.200
- Uh, Phoebe,
I need you to make

04:32.300 --> 04:33.800
a bunch of sandwiches
for the trip.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.167
- You got it.
- Make something for me, too.

04:36.267 --> 04:37.867
- Oh, good idea, Barb.

04:37.967 --> 04:39.933
- But, Dad, what
about the dollhouse?

04:40.067 --> 04:41.767
- Oh, that's gonna
have to wait, sweetie.

04:41.867 --> 04:44.433
I'm gonna be very busy
with the baby.

04:44.533 --> 04:47.367
Our fifth baby.

04:47.467 --> 04:51.067
House fulla love!

04:51.133 --> 04:52.600
- Uh-oh, your cute superpower

04:52.700 --> 04:55.167
doesn't work with
the new baby coming.

04:55.267 --> 04:58.067
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm the cute one around here.

04:58.133 --> 04:59.467
And I always will be.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.667
- Yeah, right, Nora--
once that baby comes,

05:01.767 --> 05:03.467
you'll just be another
kid in the house.

05:03.567 --> 05:04.867
You'll be lucky if
they remember your name.

05:04.967 --> 05:07.600
- Oh, you, uh,
little one with the bow,

05:07.700 --> 05:11.533
use your super speed and help me
find your Mom's slippers.

05:11.633 --> 05:14.500
- It's Nora and
I have laser eyes!

05:17.533 --> 05:19.067
- This is so exciting, Max.

05:19.167 --> 05:21.267
What do you think our baby
sister's superpowers will be?

05:21.367 --> 05:22.667
- First of all,
it's gonna be a boy,

05:22.767 --> 05:24.267
and I hope he has
the power of time travel,

05:24.367 --> 05:26.533
so I can get out
of this conversation.

05:26.633 --> 05:28.567
- Come on, you know
it's gonna be a girl.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.433
- Boy.
- Girl.

05:30.533 --> 05:32.100
- Boy.
- Girl.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.300
- It doesn't matter.
We'll find out in a few hours.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.133
Oh, gosh, Cherry.

05:36.233 --> 05:39.933
Oh, I promised her I'd go to
Wong's to help her with a boy.

05:40.067 --> 05:41.833
- You're her boy expert?

05:41.933 --> 05:43.400
Who's yours?

05:43.500 --> 05:44.767
- All right, maybe I can
still go and get back

05:44.867 --> 05:46.500
before Mom and Dad get home...

05:46.600 --> 05:47.700
with a girl.
- Boy.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.933
- PHOEBE: Boy.
- MAX: Girl.

05:49.067 --> 05:51.833
- PHOEBE: Fine. Girl.
- MAX: Oh!

05:55.467 --> 05:57.433
- What? Another baby?

05:57.533 --> 06:00.500
And they say we breed
like rabbits.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.167
- Yep, and big brother Max

06:02.267 --> 06:05.200
already has the perfect
plan to turn him evil.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.833
- Teach him the evil alphabet?

06:06.933 --> 06:09.567
* "A" is for arson
"B" is for burglary *

06:09.667 --> 06:11.467
* C--
- No.

06:11.567 --> 06:13.167
I'm gonna set my smart watch
to the frequency

06:13.267 --> 06:16.267
of these baby monitors
and teach him evil stuff

06:16.367 --> 06:17.967
every night while he sleeps.

06:18.067 --> 06:19.833
- Ha! I love it!

06:19.933 --> 06:22.200
- Let me just, uh...
clear some space here.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.567
- Hey, don't touch the towel!

06:24.667 --> 06:26.300
- [gasping]

06:26.400 --> 06:28.067
- COLOSSO: Uh...
- The animalizer?

06:28.100 --> 06:29.900
You were gonna turn
back into a human?

06:30.067 --> 06:31.700
How'd you even know
where to find this?

06:31.800 --> 06:33.500
- You talk in your sleep.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.200
The rest was easy.

06:35.300 --> 06:36.467
- Okay, Billy,
you ready to play

06:36.567 --> 06:38.267
"Pull the Can of
Brussels Sprouts?"

06:38.367 --> 06:39.500
- How do you play?

06:39.600 --> 06:43.433
- You pull the can
of brussels sprouts.

06:43.533 --> 06:47.267
You win!

06:47.367 --> 06:50.433
Now go away.

06:50.533 --> 06:52.833
[evil laughter]

06:52.933 --> 06:55.800
- You were gonna turn yourself
back into a human and leave?

06:55.900 --> 06:57.433
- Just for a few hours.

06:57.533 --> 06:59.567
Look, I wasn't gonna
tell you, but...

06:59.667 --> 07:02.333
check inside my mailbox.

07:05.933 --> 07:07.367
- [reading]
"Congratulations.

07:07.467 --> 07:09.800
"The Villain League
has named you...

07:09.900 --> 07:11.767
Villain of the Decade"?

07:11.867 --> 07:13.833
Colosso, that's awesome!

07:13.933 --> 07:17.367
- Yeah, they're having
a ceremony tonight in my honor.

07:17.467 --> 07:18.800
But if I show up as a rabbit,

07:18.900 --> 07:20.233
they'll know
your father defeated me

07:20.333 --> 07:21.967
and I'll be humiliated.

07:22.067 --> 07:25.200
- Why didn't you just ask?
- I thought you'd say "No."

07:25.300 --> 07:28.600
Can I go?
- No.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.533
If Dad found out I turned
you back into a human,

07:30.633 --> 07:33.167
even for a minute,
he'd split us up.

07:33.267 --> 07:34.800
Sorry, buddy.

07:34.900 --> 07:37.233
I'd better hide this some place
where you'll never find it.

07:41.067 --> 07:43.067
- COLOSSO: The secret drawer
in your desk?

07:43.167 --> 07:48.233
- No...think I'm stupid
or something?

07:48.333 --> 07:50.333
- COLOSSO: Ah, so under
the boulders, then?

07:50.433 --> 07:52.467
- Stop doing that!

07:52.567 --> 08:02.100
- *

08:03.500 --> 08:05.167
- You're late!
Where have you been?

08:05.267 --> 08:06.767
- Cherry, I am so sorry.

08:06.867 --> 08:09.067
I just found out my mom
is having a ba-a-a--

08:09.133 --> 08:11.467
a-a-ake sale.

08:11.567 --> 08:13.200
So how's it going here?

08:13.300 --> 08:15.700
- Well, I was afraid to go over
and start loud talking at Joey,

08:15.800 --> 08:19.333
but now that my bestie's
here, I'll be okay.

08:21.067 --> 08:24.700
Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Neil.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.233
- Bread?
- Uh, sure.

08:30.633 --> 08:33.267
- [blender whirring]

08:37.667 --> 08:40.833
- Chewing sickens me.

08:43.233 --> 08:46.367
- Mmm, I'd better get
us some spoons.

08:46.467 --> 08:48.167
- Wait, uh, Phoebe, don't go.

08:48.267 --> 08:51.333
- I'll be right back.

08:51.433 --> 08:53.967
Oh, hi, Mrs. Wong.
I was just grabbing some spoons.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.600
- To eat pizza?
[scoffing]

08:55.700 --> 08:58.833
I guess everyone else
is doing it wrong.

08:58.933 --> 09:01.200
Here you go, weirdo.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.167
- Uh, wait, uh,
this one's dirty.

09:03.267 --> 09:07.167
- So, wash it.
I'm not your mama.

09:07.267 --> 09:09.267
- And I have a cat
named Moon Pie!!

09:09.367 --> 09:12.267
Do you have any pets?!!

09:12.367 --> 09:15.333
- Uh, Cherry, can I talk
to you for a sec?

09:15.433 --> 09:18.733
- Yes!! Excuse me!!

09:21.867 --> 09:24.667
I think I was
talking too loud.

09:24.767 --> 09:27.400
- You're just nervous.
Come on, slap it out.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.667
You have nothing
to worry about.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.367
Joey likes you. I can tell.

09:31.467 --> 09:34.900
And, plus, you are totally
rocking the combat boots.

09:35.067 --> 09:36.733
- What would I do
without you?

09:36.833 --> 09:38.267
Now don't leave me again.

09:38.367 --> 09:41.533
- All right. I promise.

09:41.633 --> 09:44.467
- Okay, sorry.
Where were we?

09:44.567 --> 09:48.667
- Caesar salad for the lady?

09:48.767 --> 09:51.100
- [liquid splooshing]

09:56.867 --> 10:00.033
- HANK: [rhythmic panting]

10:00.133 --> 10:04.000
- Wow, having a baby
looks really uncomfortable.

10:04.100 --> 10:07.367
- I know. The big belly.
The swollen feet.

10:07.467 --> 10:11.000
- Yeah, and Mom doesn't
look too good, either.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.667
- Oh, hey, Dad, if you have
time in the hospital,

10:13.767 --> 10:15.533
maybe you can build
my new dollhouse.

10:15.633 --> 10:17.400
- BARB: [powers zapping]

10:20.233 --> 10:22.767
Hank, my thunder surges
are getting stronger.

10:22.867 --> 10:24.400
- Okay, it's fine.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.600
Just, if it happens again,
make sure you don't hit the--

10:26.700 --> 10:31.500
- [powers zapping]
- [van alarm blaring]

10:31.600 --> 10:33.033
- MALE COMPUTER VOICE:
System down.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.767
Estimated repair time
--two hours.

10:35.867 --> 10:37.800
- Oh, no, Hank,
what'll we do?

10:37.900 --> 10:39.833
- Okay, honey, it's fine.
Don't panic.

10:39.933 --> 10:41.333
Just, uh, I'll fly you
to the hospital myself.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.067
- We can't! What if I have
the baby mid-air?

10:44.167 --> 10:47.033
Remember what happened
the last time?

10:47.133 --> 10:48.900
- Why are you pointing at me?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.733
What happened last time?

10:50.833 --> 10:52.567
- Oh, no!
- What "Oh, no."

10:52.667 --> 10:54.167
- It's time.
- No. No, it's not.

10:54.267 --> 10:55.933
- Yes, it is.
- No, no, it's not.

10:56.033 --> 10:57.933
It can't be. You're gonna
have to hold it in.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.100
- Hold it in?
I can't hold it in!

11:00.200 --> 11:01.533
- You can't have
a superhero baby

11:01.633 --> 11:03.200
at a non-superhero hospital.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.900
- I know. Well, I guess
we'll just have to

11:05.067 --> 11:06.067
have it here at the house.

11:06.167 --> 11:07.500
- Who can deliver it?
- You are.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.967
- I am?!

11:10.067 --> 11:12.967
- What happened last time?!

11:17.333 --> 11:20.067
- BARB: [electrical zapping]
[screaming]

11:20.133 --> 11:21.700
- This is not how
babies are born

11:21.800 --> 11:24.867
in the nature movies
at school.

11:24.967 --> 11:28.800
- The miracle of birth
is horrifying!

11:28.900 --> 11:30.533
- Billy, I need you
and Nora to super speed

11:30.633 --> 11:33.267
to the baby store and buy
everything on this list--

11:33.367 --> 11:36.467
diapers, baby wipes,
formula, ear plugs.

11:36.567 --> 11:38.067
- Why do you need ear plugs?

11:38.100 --> 11:40.600
- BARB: [powers thundering]
Hank!!!!

11:40.700 --> 11:42.133
- Got it.

11:42.233 --> 11:45.667
- Now here's some money
and no pit stops along the way.

11:45.767 --> 11:48.533
Now Phoebe--
Where's Phoebe?

11:48.633 --> 11:50.533
- She went on a date.
- A date?

11:50.633 --> 11:52.900
- I know. Poor guy.

11:53.067 --> 11:54.633
- You call her and get her
back here right away.

11:54.733 --> 11:56.733
We are in labor!

11:56.833 --> 11:58.100
- BARB: [powers thundering]
We, Hank?!

11:58.200 --> 12:01.900
- You, Barb, you.
You're my queen.

12:02.067 --> 12:04.267
- Wow, pregnancy's
making Mom cranky.

12:04.367 --> 12:06.500
- Hey, she is still
your sweet Mom.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.500
- BARB: [powers thundering]
Get up here, Ha-a-a-a-nk!!

12:13.933 --> 12:15.467
- So, the teacher goes,

12:15.567 --> 12:17.700
"Cherry, good job
dissecting that frog.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.567
Too bad we're in history class."

12:19.667 --> 12:21.833
- JOEY: What?
[laughing]

12:21.933 --> 12:23.867
- Here you go. Baked fresh--

12:23.967 --> 12:26.167
last Tuesday.
[cackling]

12:26.267 --> 12:28.900
- Yay, I am so starving.
I haven't eaten all day.

12:29.067 --> 12:30.900
- Why didn't you have anything
at that bake sale?

12:31.067 --> 12:32.467
- What bake sale?

12:32.567 --> 12:34.533
- The one that you said
your mom was having.

12:34.633 --> 12:36.400
- Oh, the bake sale.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.100
Yeah, no, I didn't
say bake sale.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.867
I said brake sale.

12:40.967 --> 12:43.967
You know, car brakes,
bike brakes.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.367
- [cell phone ringing]

12:45.467 --> 12:46.933
- Lucky breaks.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.067
Excuse me for a sec.

12:49.167 --> 12:51.067
- Your friend's weird.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.167
Mushroom calzone?

12:54.933 --> 12:56.267
- What is it, Max?

12:56.367 --> 12:59.600
What? Okay! Um...
I'll be right there.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.900
- Phoebe, this is
going so well.

13:02.067 --> 13:04.233
Thank you so much
for being here.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.900
- You're welcome.
I have to leave.

13:07.067 --> 13:08.500
- What?

13:08.600 --> 13:12.300
Phoebe! You promised!

13:12.400 --> 13:14.267
[sighing]

13:14.367 --> 13:18.100
So, how's everybody doing?!!

13:21.200 --> 13:23.867
- I don't know, Billy.
Maybe Max is right.

13:23.967 --> 13:25.533
Now that the baby's coming,

13:25.633 --> 13:28.267
I'll just be another
kid in the house.

13:28.367 --> 13:30.533
At least you still
pay attention to me.

13:30.633 --> 13:32.067
Billy?

13:32.167 --> 13:34.067
- FEMALE VOICE:
The rooster goes...

13:34.167 --> 13:36.933
- BILLY: Mooo!
- [rooster crowing]

13:37.067 --> 13:39.433
- They don't give you
enough time.

13:39.533 --> 13:42.333
- I guess my cute
years are over.

13:42.433 --> 13:43.767
- What are you
talking about?

13:43.867 --> 13:45.167
You're still cute.

13:45.267 --> 13:47.267
Well, not as cute
as that baby.

13:47.367 --> 13:49.767
But how can you compete
with a baby?

13:49.867 --> 13:51.200
- Attention, shoppers!

13:51.300 --> 13:54.267
Please join us for
our Cutest Baby Contest--

13:54.367 --> 13:55.800
starting in five minutes.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.333
Woo-hoo!

13:57.433 --> 14:00.200
- That's how I'm gonna compete.
You'll see.

14:00.300 --> 14:05.267
I'm gonna win Cutest Baby.

14:05.367 --> 14:08.067
- Good luck entering
without a parent.

14:08.133 --> 14:10.633
- Come on, you're the dad.

14:10.733 --> 14:13.400
- Oh, man...

14:13.500 --> 14:16.933
- BARB: [powers thundering]
[screaming]

14:17.067 --> 14:18.833
- Hey, how's Mom?

14:18.933 --> 14:21.267
- No baby yet, oh, and Dad's
mad at you for leaving.

14:21.367 --> 14:23.267
- Perfect. Cherry's
mad at me, too.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.300
I can't win!
- Hey, this'll cheer you up.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.200
- BARB: [powers zapping]
Hank!!

14:27.300 --> 14:32.200
- HANK: [thudding, yelping]

14:32.300 --> 14:35.067
- [laughing]
It gets funnier every time.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.967
All right, Dad,
you're lookin' good.

14:37.067 --> 14:38.967
Shake it off.
- [sighing]

14:39.067 --> 14:40.467
- You've got this.

14:40.567 --> 14:42.667
Now, go up there, show that baby
who's boss when Mom's not home.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.067
- BARB: [powers thundering]

14:46.133 --> 14:47.600
- How long has that
been going on?

14:47.700 --> 14:49.067
- Oh, about an hour.

14:49.133 --> 14:51.067
- BARB: [powers thundering]
Get out!!!

14:51.100 --> 14:53.433
- HANK: [yelping, thudding]

14:53.533 --> 14:58.733
Hey, guys, it's Moebe
and Phax.

14:58.833 --> 15:01.367
- Uh-oh, Dad's broken.

15:01.467 --> 15:02.800
We don't know how
to deliver a baby.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.067
What are we gonna do?

15:04.167 --> 15:06.200
- Well, first, we're
gonna take a picture.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.967
- HANK: Hey!
- BARB: [powers thundering]

15:09.067 --> 15:10.933
- Then we're gonna
find someone

15:11.067 --> 15:12.933
with tons of medical
experience.

15:13.067 --> 15:14.367
And I know just the guy.

15:14.467 --> 15:16.967
- So, you won't let me
go pick up a trophy,

15:17.067 --> 15:20.533
but delivering a baby,
that's okay.

15:20.633 --> 15:22.533
- Dr. Colosso, please,
we're begging you.

15:22.633 --> 15:24.300
- Our Mom is having
the baby right now.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.467
- Okay. Okay. I'll do it.

15:26.567 --> 15:28.933
Now boil water
and get me some towels.

15:29.067 --> 15:30.867
Tie back my whiskers.

15:30.967 --> 15:32.867
Let's mambo!

15:34.767 --> 15:41.500
- BARB: [screaming]
- HANK: [screaming]

15:41.600 --> 15:45.200
- BABY: [crying]

15:45.300 --> 15:50.800
- Phoebe, Max, meet
your new baby sister...

15:53.400 --> 15:56.467
- ...Chloe Thunderman.

15:56.567 --> 15:58.067
- Told you it
would be a girl.

15:58.133 --> 16:01.167
- I'm still
making her evil.

16:01.267 --> 16:02.833
- COLOSSO: Ahem!

16:02.933 --> 16:05.333
You're welcome.

16:05.433 --> 16:07.267
- Thanks, Dr. Colosso.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.733
- Look, kids, superheroes
need a 12 hour recharge nap

16:10.833 --> 16:14.367
after giving birth, so let's
give your Mom some privacy.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.367
- Oh, it's okay, Hank.

16:16.467 --> 16:18.633
You know, I don't
think I'll need...

16:18.733 --> 16:21.267
[groaning]

16:21.367 --> 16:23.433
- I'm very happy for you.

16:23.533 --> 16:25.067
- Thanks.

16:25.167 --> 16:26.400
- I was talking to Chloe.

16:26.500 --> 16:29.067
I'm happy she looks
nothing like you.

16:29.133 --> 16:31.067
[evil laughter]

16:31.167 --> 16:35.633
- *

16:35.733 --> 16:37.500
- You really helped us
out there, Colosso.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.767
- That's what friends are for.

16:39.867 --> 16:42.667
- Friends.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.500
Hey, what time does
your event start?

16:44.600 --> 16:47.300
- What's the difference?
I told you--

16:47.400 --> 16:49.300
I can't show my furry face
at the Villain League.

16:49.400 --> 16:54.167
- But, what if your
face wasn't furry?

16:54.267 --> 16:55.433
- The animalizer?

16:55.533 --> 16:57.800
You're going to turn me human?

16:57.900 --> 16:59.867
- On one condition--

17:00.067 --> 17:02.900
you let me go with you to watch
you get that cool award.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.800
- Yippee! It's a deal!

17:04.900 --> 17:07.900
Hit me with the people
juice. Get me!

17:08.067 --> 17:09.967
- [animalizer zapping]

17:15.067 --> 17:17.233
- Well, I'm waiting.

17:17.333 --> 17:20.533
What? What are
you staring at?

17:20.633 --> 17:25.200
Whoa! I'm a person again!

17:25.300 --> 17:27.767
[yelping]

17:27.867 --> 17:29.300
I have arms!

17:29.400 --> 17:31.233
And tiny ears!

17:31.333 --> 17:33.367
And no tail!

17:33.467 --> 17:35.800
Just a regular old
people butt!

17:35.900 --> 17:38.800
Thanks, Max.
- Sure.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.933
- Hey, come on.
Let's take a selfie together.

17:42.067 --> 17:43.633
Say "supervillains!"

17:43.733 --> 17:46.500
- BOTH: Supervillains!
- [cell phone camera clicking]

17:46.600 --> 17:50.333
- All right, let's put
on our jet packs...

17:50.433 --> 17:53.100
...when you finish
feeling your butt.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.567
- I can do both.

17:58.833 --> 18:01.767
- One by one. Yay!
- CROWD: [applauding]

18:01.867 --> 18:04.267
- [laughing]
And that concludes

18:04.367 --> 18:06.300
the crawling portion
of our contest.

18:06.400 --> 18:10.100
Coming up next, we have--
- NORA: Wait!

18:10.200 --> 18:13.267
Introduce me, Dad!

18:13.367 --> 18:15.333
- Hi, fellow parents.

18:15.433 --> 18:20.533
Uh, you should really
see my baby crawl.

18:20.633 --> 18:24.533
- Very strange.
That's a huge baby.

18:24.633 --> 18:26.933
Oh, that's no baby.
That's a little girl.

18:27.067 --> 18:28.467
She can't be in the contest.

18:28.567 --> 18:31.300
- The sign says
ages zero to nine.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.833
- That's months.

18:32.933 --> 18:34.833
- You should put it on
the sign, judgey pants.

18:34.933 --> 18:38.100
Now let's go.
I'm not getting any younger.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.300
- You got that right.

18:40.400 --> 18:44.400
Fine, let's see
the giant baby crawl.

18:44.500 --> 18:48.167
- All right, kids, watch
how a cute baby does it.

18:48.267 --> 18:50.200
Hit it, Pop!

18:50.300 --> 19:06.433
- *

19:14.067 --> 19:16.233
- COLOSSO: Oh.

19:16.333 --> 19:18.600
- This is Villain
League Headquarters?

19:18.700 --> 19:20.633
It's an old broccoli factory.

19:20.733 --> 19:24.267
- Yes, broccoli workers
are so easy to overthrow.

19:24.367 --> 19:27.700
[evil laughter]

19:27.800 --> 19:32.267
- MALE VOICE: State password.

19:32.367 --> 19:33.900
- Password.

19:34.067 --> 19:37.733
- The password is "password"?
- Shhhh!

19:37.833 --> 19:39.600
Come on!

19:39.700 --> 19:44.333
- *

19:44.433 --> 19:48.933
- MAX: Whoa!
[gasping]

19:49.067 --> 19:51.800
Oh! Whoa!

19:51.900 --> 19:56.333
These are the greatest
villains of all time--

19:56.433 --> 20:00.767
and the weapons that
made them famous.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.200
It's beautiful!

20:04.300 --> 20:07.267
- Dr. Colosso.
- MAX: [gasping]

20:07.367 --> 20:08.733
- COLOSSO: Hey, hey.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.233
- It's King Crab!
It's Killstro and Lady Web!

20:11.333 --> 20:12.867
- Be cool, Max.

20:12.967 --> 20:16.700
Remember, if anyone asks,
you're my evil assistant Norman.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.867
King Crab!

20:18.967 --> 20:20.733
Ugh...

20:20.833 --> 20:21.833
Hi.

20:21.933 --> 20:24.167
- Dr. Colosso, so glad
you could join us.

20:24.267 --> 20:25.467
You know these two crazies.

20:25.567 --> 20:28.033
- BOTH: Viva la evil!

20:28.133 --> 20:30.900
- Hey, guys, viva la evil!

20:31.000 --> 20:34.933
- Hi, I'm Norman.
Just happy to be here.

20:35.033 --> 20:37.400
- So, uh, it looks like
we're a little early.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.100
Ha. Ha. No problem.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.500
It'll give me more
time to practise

20:40.600 --> 20:43.667
my Villain of
the Decade speech.

20:43.767 --> 20:45.700
- Ah, yes, your speech.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.633
Listen, here's the thing
about that.

20:48.733 --> 20:51.533
We lied!

20:51.633 --> 20:53.267
- You did what now?

20:53.367 --> 20:54.767
- That's right.

20:54.867 --> 20:57.267
We lured you here to kick
you out of the League.

20:57.367 --> 20:59.900
- You haven't done
anything evil in years.

21:00.067 --> 21:04.333
- You've gone s-s-s-soft!

21:04.433 --> 21:06.333
- S-s-s-soft?

21:06.433 --> 21:07.533
This is Dr. Colosso.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.467
He's as evil as they come.

21:09.567 --> 21:12.700
He boos at funerals.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.567
- Hand over your
Villain League card.

21:14.667 --> 21:17.400
Take his cape.
- Not my cape? My cape!

21:17.500 --> 21:18.833
There's a very simple
explanation.

21:18.933 --> 21:21.367
See, for the last few years,
I've been busy...

21:21.467 --> 21:24.133
capturing this guy--

21:24.233 --> 21:27.600
Thunder Man's son!
- What?

21:27.700 --> 21:29.500
[nervous laugh]
No, no, no, my name's Norman.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.467
- [metal clamp clicking]

21:31.567 --> 21:33.233
- Dr. Colosso,
what are you doing?

21:33.333 --> 21:36.267
- Quiet, prisoner!

21:36.367 --> 21:37.633
- [scanner beeping]

21:37.733 --> 21:39.400
- Superhero DNA confirmed.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.667
- [evil laughter]
[pincer clicking]

21:40.767 --> 21:43.367
Ooh, what a kingly catch.

21:43.467 --> 21:44.733
Well done, Colosso.

21:44.833 --> 21:48.633
Now take his phone so he can't
call his daddy for help.

21:48.733 --> 21:50.300
- I'm not gonna need help.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.867
Feel my heat, crab face.
[exhaling]

21:53.967 --> 21:56.067
- Your powers won't work
with that clamp on.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.467
And your toothbrush won't
work unless you use it.

21:58.567 --> 22:03.400
Now, prepare him...
for the hermit crabs.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.067
- Hermit crabs?

22:05.167 --> 22:07.267
Think I'm afraid of
a few little hermit crabs?

22:07.367 --> 22:10.300
[screaming]

22:14.267 --> 22:15.867
- [evil laughter]

22:15.967 --> 22:19.700
Things are about to get very...

22:19.800 --> 22:25.133
- [crabs chomping]

22:25.233 --> 22:26.567
- Pinchy.

22:26.667 --> 22:31.833
- SUPERVILLAINS:
[evil laughter]

22:31.933 --> 22:36.800
- *

22:39.900 --> 22:42.100
- *

22:42.200 --> 22:44.300
- COLOSSO NARRATING:
So, there we were--

22:44.400 --> 22:46.067
me, kickin' it
as a human again,

22:46.167 --> 22:48.300
and Max dangling over
a vat of hungry crabs.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.300
Poor guy seemed
a little upset.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.267
- You guys can't do
this to me.

22:52.367 --> 22:54.300
I'm a supervillain
like you.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.467
I--I have a lair,
I hate puppies,

22:56.567 --> 23:00.167
I sneeze on bottles
of hand sanitizer.

23:00.267 --> 23:01.700
Colosso, tell them.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.733
- Yeah, right, like the son
of Thunder Man

23:03.833 --> 23:06.533
would ever be a villain.

23:06.633 --> 23:08.567
- Sounds like a phase to me.

23:08.667 --> 23:10.767
- It's not a phase!

23:10.867 --> 23:15.333
- SUPERVILLAINS:
[evil laughter]

23:15.433 --> 23:17.167
- Come, Colosso,

23:17.267 --> 23:19.833
we have a little time before
he's lowered to his doom.

23:19.933 --> 23:22.400
Oh, Thunder Boy,
be sure to scream loud

23:22.500 --> 23:24.633
so we know when
the show starts.

23:24.733 --> 23:26.300
- SUPERVILLAINS:
[evil laughter]

23:26.400 --> 23:28.167
- I got ya, Claw Daddy!

23:31.567 --> 23:32.933
- Dr. Colosso!

23:33.067 --> 23:35.133
Are you just gonna
let them lower me

23:35.233 --> 23:36.900
into a vat of hermit crabs?

23:37.067 --> 23:38.733
- When you put it that way--

23:38.833 --> 23:41.700
Yep!
[evil laughter]

23:44.733 --> 23:48.067
- Wow, look who
emptied her bottle.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.467
Again!

23:49.567 --> 23:50.833
You keep eating like this,
you're gonna have

23:50.933 --> 23:53.933
your first superhero
growth spurt today.

23:54.067 --> 23:56.333
- You should have seen
your first growth spurt.

23:56.433 --> 23:58.667
You doubled in size.

23:58.767 --> 24:01.533
Max's first spurt was
all in his diaper.

24:01.633 --> 24:03.300
- Speaking of diapers,

24:03.400 --> 24:05.167
I thought you sent Billy
and Nora out for supplies.

24:05.267 --> 24:07.367
- Yeah, with a hundred
dollars cash.

24:07.467 --> 24:09.833
That might have
been a mistake.

24:09.933 --> 24:11.500
Uh, better go find 'em.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.233
Thunder Man, away!

24:13.333 --> 24:15.667
- You can't go through the
ceiling with a baby in the room!

24:15.767 --> 24:17.367
- Right. Thunder Man...

24:17.467 --> 24:21.267
going out the back.

24:21.367 --> 24:24.900
Then away!
[zooming]

24:26.867 --> 24:30.433
- Looks like it's just
you and me, huh, Chloe?

24:30.533 --> 24:35.067
Yes, it is.
- CHLOE: [cooing]

24:35.100 --> 24:36.967
- Aw, bubbles?

24:37.067 --> 24:39.700
Even your
superpower's adorable.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.700
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

24:41.800 --> 24:43.633
Angry Cherry approaching.

24:43.733 --> 24:46.100
- Oh. All right, Chloe,
you're about to learn

24:46.200 --> 24:48.067
the hardest part
of being a superhero--

24:48.100 --> 24:50.900
keeping it a secret
from your best friend.

24:51.067 --> 24:52.533
Help me out.
Shhh...

24:52.633 --> 24:55.067
- CHLOE: [cooing]

24:57.900 --> 24:59.500
- Hey, Cherry. Oh! Uh...

24:59.600 --> 25:03.667
I am so so sorry I had
to run out on you.

25:03.767 --> 25:05.067
How'd it go?
- Let's see.

25:05.133 --> 25:06.633
As soon as you left,
I got nervous again

25:06.733 --> 25:08.067
and started loud talking.

25:08.167 --> 25:11.767
Then Joey went to the bathroom
and never came back.

25:11.867 --> 25:15.533
And Neil made me drink
buffalo wings!!

25:15.633 --> 25:17.633
- CHLOE: [crying]

25:17.733 --> 25:19.900
- Is that a baby?
- What?

25:20.067 --> 25:21.900
No, uh, it's my stomach.

25:22.067 --> 25:24.700
All that liquid bread, whew.

25:28.867 --> 25:32.500
- No, that's a baby.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.267
Where did she come from?

25:34.367 --> 25:37.800
- Well, when a mommy and a daddy
love each other very much--

25:37.900 --> 25:41.433
- Phoebe!
- Okay. Okay.

25:41.533 --> 25:44.467
Cherry...

25:44.567 --> 25:46.133
meet my new baby sister...

25:46.233 --> 25:47.900
Chloe.

25:48.067 --> 25:52.267
- You have a new baby sister
and you didn't even tell me?

25:52.367 --> 25:53.767
- [speaking as Chloe]
Don't be mad at Phoebe.

25:53.867 --> 25:57.633
You guys are friends.

25:57.733 --> 26:00.067
- Are we?

26:00.167 --> 26:02.533
Honestly, I feel like you're
always hiding things from me.

26:02.633 --> 26:04.067
- Look, I know.

26:04.133 --> 26:07.600
The truth is, I do have
a lot of secrets.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.467
I just can't tell you
any of them.

26:10.567 --> 26:11.767
- What kind of best friends

26:11.867 --> 26:15.067
don't tell each other
everything?

26:15.167 --> 26:16.433
- Uh...

26:16.533 --> 26:17.933
- Guess that's my answer.

26:18.067 --> 26:20.200
- Look, Cherry, wait.

26:20.300 --> 26:22.100
[sighing]

26:22.200 --> 26:27.200
- *

26:27.300 --> 26:29.700
- Oh, you clean up someone's
poop for three years

26:29.800 --> 26:32.233
and this is the thanks
you get?

26:32.333 --> 26:36.667
[straining]

26:36.767 --> 26:38.800
Aha, my smart watch.

26:38.900 --> 26:42.633
I can tap into the baby
monitor and alert Dad.

26:42.733 --> 26:44.433
[straining]

26:44.533 --> 26:46.633
- [watch buttons beeping]

26:46.733 --> 26:49.767
- [hot air gusting]

26:49.867 --> 26:53.567
Hold on, Chloe,
your bottle's almost ready.

26:53.667 --> 26:55.067
- MAX ON BABY MONITOR:
Help!

26:55.167 --> 26:57.100
Villains are lowering me
into a vat of hermit crabs.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.100
- Aw, Chloe's first words were:

26:59.200 --> 27:02.700
"Help! Villains are lowering me
into a vat of hermit crabs."

27:02.800 --> 27:04.633
Say what?

27:04.733 --> 27:06.133
- MAX: Wait, if anyone
is listening,

27:06.233 --> 27:11.700
tell Dad I'm at the old broccoli
factory in Metroburg.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.100
Please, help!

27:13.200 --> 27:17.600
- Metroburg?
I'd better call Dad.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.233
- [cell phone ringing]

27:21.867 --> 27:24.933
- Oh, no, he left his phone.

27:25.067 --> 27:27.433
There's only
one thing to do.

27:27.533 --> 27:29.067
Wake up, Mom!

27:29.100 --> 27:32.333
You gotta get up!
Max is in trouble!

27:32.433 --> 27:34.967
Wake up!

27:35.067 --> 27:37.600
I can't take a baby
to fight villains.

27:37.700 --> 27:39.300
What am I gonna do?

27:39.400 --> 27:41.067
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

27:41.167 --> 27:43.500
Angry Cherry sulking on porch.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.833
- Cherry!

27:49.967 --> 27:52.233
- [door opens]

27:52.333 --> 27:54.467
- Cherry, I'm so glad
you're still here.

27:54.567 --> 27:56.067
- I had no choice.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.067
I'm not allowed to ride
my bicycle angry.

27:58.100 --> 28:00.100
- Okay, look, I know you're
still mad at me,

28:00.200 --> 28:01.933
but I really need a favor.

28:02.067 --> 28:04.167
I need you to watch Chloe
while I go run an errand.

28:04.267 --> 28:07.067
- Where? To the secret store
to buy more secrets?

28:07.167 --> 28:10.633
- Support the head.
Thank you.

28:10.733 --> 28:15.733
- Phoebe, you can't do this.

28:15.833 --> 28:18.400
We're not friends any more.

28:24.933 --> 28:27.167
- Thunder Van, hyper speed
to Metroburg.

28:27.267 --> 28:28.967
- MALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Hyper speed repair incomplete.

28:29.067 --> 28:30.833
- Fine. Any speed. Just go.

28:30.933 --> 28:32.667
- COMPUTER VOICE:
Initiating.

28:32.767 --> 28:34.433
- [van power surging]

28:39.167 --> 28:40.767
- Thunder Van, stop!

28:40.867 --> 28:42.500
- [van powering down]

28:42.600 --> 28:44.733
- [hydraulics whirring]

28:44.833 --> 28:46.267
- Get in, Cherry.

28:46.367 --> 28:48.467
It's time I tell
you everything.

28:55.933 --> 28:58.200
- COMPUTER VOICE:
Baby secure.

28:58.300 --> 29:03.267
- CHERRY: Uh, how is this
van driving itself?

29:03.367 --> 29:09.167
- Cherry, have you ever
heard of Thunder Man?

29:09.267 --> 29:11.233
- So many adorable babies.

29:11.333 --> 29:14.433
And so many wonderful
bargains here at Tots.

29:14.533 --> 29:16.967
- Get to the winner!

29:17.067 --> 29:19.933
- Oh, they grow up so fast.

29:20.067 --> 29:24.367
And the winner of The Cutest
Baby Contest is...

29:24.467 --> 29:26.733
Britney Williams!

29:26.833 --> 29:28.833
- BILLY: Uh-oh.

29:28.933 --> 29:31.067
- Are you kidding me?

29:31.133 --> 29:33.233
You picked the drooler?

29:33.333 --> 29:35.333
What does she have
that I don't?

29:35.433 --> 29:38.700
- A birth certificate
from this year.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.667
Please take your
tiny dad and leave!

29:41.767 --> 29:46.067
- Fine. I'd crawl out of here,
but I know how to walk.

29:48.133 --> 29:49.900
Wait, who won second place?

29:50.067 --> 29:51.733
- Not you.
- Okay.

29:55.100 --> 29:58.467
- Sorry, she takes
after her mother.

30:03.267 --> 30:05.667
- COLOSSO & KING CRAB:
[evil laughter]

30:08.067 --> 30:10.667
- Oh, man, it's good to have
you back, Dr. Colosso.

30:10.767 --> 30:14.033
Now the Villain League will be
restored to its former glory.

30:14.133 --> 30:15.933
- I'm ready, baby.

30:16.033 --> 30:17.933
I've got an evil plan
to use my shrink ray

30:18.033 --> 30:21.800
to turn Minneapolis
into Mini-Minneapolis.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.700
- BOTH: [laughing]

30:23.800 --> 30:26.033
- Oh, viva la evil!

30:26.133 --> 30:28.733
Oh, look, I've got
the happy claw.

30:28.833 --> 30:30.967
Let's celebrate.

30:31.067 --> 30:33.400
Madge, bubble wrap
for two, please?

30:33.500 --> 30:35.367
- You've still got a thing
with the bubble wrap, huh?

30:35.467 --> 30:38.967
- Oh, I can't help it.
I just love poppin' stuff.

30:39.067 --> 30:41.300
Oh...Ha. Ha. Ha.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.667
Pop! Pop! Pop!
Poppity! Pop! Pop!

30:43.767 --> 30:46.767
Look at me go.
[laughing]

30:46.867 --> 30:48.633
Colosso, get over here.

30:48.733 --> 30:49.900
Take a selfie with me.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.067
- I've done those.

30:55.833 --> 30:57.200
- Hey, what's the hold up?

30:57.300 --> 30:58.633
Worried about how you look?

30:58.733 --> 31:02.067
I've got a claw for a hand.

31:02.167 --> 31:05.167
- No, no, I just realized
I'm double parked--

31:05.267 --> 31:07.333
on top of another car.

31:07.433 --> 31:08.933
- [laughing]
[claw clicking]

31:09.067 --> 31:10.867
Dr. Colosso!

31:10.967 --> 31:14.067
Oh, well, more for me.
Pop! Pop! Pop!

31:14.100 --> 31:17.100
[laughing]
It will never get old.

31:22.067 --> 31:23.233
- Max!

31:23.333 --> 31:27.067
- Oh, hello, Dr. Jerk Face.

31:27.167 --> 31:28.233
- I deserve that.

31:28.333 --> 31:30.067
Can you ever
forgive me, old pal?

31:30.133 --> 31:32.533
So what if they think
I've gone soft.

31:32.633 --> 31:35.100
Nothing's worth betraying
my pal, Max.

31:35.200 --> 31:36.967
- Wait. You're actually
gonna save me?

31:37.067 --> 31:39.767
What about King Crab?
- That bottom feeder--

31:39.867 --> 31:41.667
he doesn't scare me.

31:41.767 --> 31:43.367
- Really?

31:43.467 --> 31:46.233
- Ah! Please don't pinch me!

31:46.333 --> 31:48.333
- Well, isn't this touching.

31:48.433 --> 31:53.867
Pardon me while I dry
my tears with my claw.

31:53.967 --> 31:55.733
- All right, you caught me.

31:55.833 --> 31:58.967
Max Thunderman and I
are friends.

31:59.067 --> 32:00.900
- Oh. Well, then,
I don't suppose

32:01.067 --> 32:03.733
you'll mind
"hanging out" together.

32:03.833 --> 32:05.433
[laughing]

32:10.500 --> 32:14.567
- I can't help but feel that
some of this is my fault.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.500
- You're unbelievable.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.900
Can I get my own tank
of hermit crabs, please?

32:20.067 --> 32:21.567
- And tear you two apart?

32:21.667 --> 32:23.800
I'll leave that to
my hungry little friends.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.600
- SUPERVILLAINS:
[evil laughter]

32:25.700 --> 32:28.567
- [pressing buttons,
pulling levers]

32:28.667 --> 32:36.633
- *

32:40.067 --> 32:42.333
- Well, Cherry,
that's the whole story.

32:42.433 --> 32:45.833
- So you're saying that you
and your family are superheroes,

32:45.933 --> 32:47.967
your brother has
a talking rabbit,

32:48.067 --> 32:51.400
and you're going to Metroburg
to rescue him from villains?

32:51.500 --> 32:55.067
- Yeah, it feels so good to
finally tell you everything.

32:55.133 --> 32:58.067
- Do ya think I'm stupid?

32:58.133 --> 32:59.533
- What? No.

32:59.633 --> 33:03.133
- So your dad's name is
"Thunder Man" Thunderman?

33:03.233 --> 33:05.133
You sound ridiculous.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.733
- No, I swear it's true.

33:06.833 --> 33:09.600
- MALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Arriving at destination.

33:09.700 --> 33:13.700
- I'll prove it right after
I go save Max from villains.

33:13.800 --> 33:16.467
Watch Chloe and stay in
the van no matter what.

33:16.567 --> 33:19.700
- "Villains,"
"stay in the van"--lies!

33:19.800 --> 33:21.867
Got it!

33:21.967 --> 33:28.333
- *

33:29.933 --> 33:31.900
- Nora, can we go now?

33:32.067 --> 33:36.900
I wanna meet the baby
and show it my 'stache.

33:37.067 --> 33:39.133
- I'm not leaving.
- Why not?

33:39.233 --> 33:41.067
Just because the baby's cute

33:41.100 --> 33:43.067
doesn't mean you
can't be cute, too.

33:43.133 --> 33:45.467
- It's not just about
being cute.

33:45.567 --> 33:48.067
If I'm not the baby of
the family anymore,

33:48.167 --> 33:51.100
I won't be special.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.633
- It's okay, Nora.

33:52.733 --> 33:54.433
I don't know if
you know this--

33:54.533 --> 33:57.600
but I used to be
the baby of the family,

33:57.700 --> 34:02.133
and then you came along
and I was so upset.

34:02.233 --> 34:03.767
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:03.867 --> 34:07.600
I even covered you
in stamps to mail you away.

34:07.700 --> 34:10.633
But then you
smiled at me and...

34:10.733 --> 34:12.900
I didn't have
the heart to do it.

34:13.067 --> 34:14.133
And before I knew it,

34:14.233 --> 34:18.133
my baby sister
was my best friend.

34:18.233 --> 34:20.367
- Thanks, Billy.

34:23.067 --> 34:24.533
- There you guys are.

34:24.633 --> 34:26.567
I've been to every store
in town looking for you.

34:26.667 --> 34:29.867
Let's go meet your new sister.

34:29.967 --> 34:31.100
- It's a girl?

34:31.200 --> 34:33.133
I have to teach
her about bows!

34:33.233 --> 34:36.633
There's so many
things that can go wrong.

34:36.733 --> 34:38.500
- I'm glad she's
taking it well.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.367
You were a mess
when she was born.

34:40.467 --> 34:42.333
Do you remember when you
covered her in stamps

34:42.433 --> 34:43.967
and mailed her to Abu Dhabi?

34:44.067 --> 34:47.367
- Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.
That's between you, me,

34:47.467 --> 34:50.700
and the nice royal
family who mailed her back.

34:52.867 --> 34:55.233
- [claws clicking]

34:55.333 --> 34:58.367
- COLOSSO: [gasping]
I'm sorry, Max.

34:58.467 --> 35:00.600
I should never
have betrayed you.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.633
- It's all right.
You were just being evil.

35:02.733 --> 35:04.967
I can't fault
a friend for that.

35:06.833 --> 35:14.567
- *

35:14.667 --> 35:18.200
- Wait. Wait.
Where are the bad guys?

35:18.300 --> 35:19.700
- MAX & COLOSSO: Phoebe!

35:19.800 --> 35:23.267
- I never thought
I'd be happy to see her.

35:23.367 --> 35:25.733
- You turned Colosso human?

35:25.833 --> 35:27.733
Oh, you are so dead
when you get home.

35:27.833 --> 35:29.733
- I'll be dead in about
five minutes,

35:29.833 --> 35:31.967
if you don't get
us down from here.

35:32.067 --> 35:34.533
[screaming]
Hurry!

35:39.300 --> 35:42.633
- Bravo! Thunder Man's
daughter, I presume.

35:42.733 --> 35:45.367
- COLOSSO: Yeah, why don't you
take her and let me go?

35:45.467 --> 35:47.200
- Colosso!
- Sorry.

35:47.300 --> 35:49.333
Let us go.

35:49.433 --> 35:50.467
- Not a chance.

35:50.567 --> 35:52.100
Now that I have
the three of you here,

35:52.200 --> 35:54.200
it's gonna be quite
a party.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.567
- Yeah, it's gonna be
a real blast.

35:56.667 --> 36:01.167
- Hey, that's Grapple Girl.

36:01.267 --> 36:03.167
Show some respect.

36:03.267 --> 36:05.233
- She was my date
to Evil Prom.

36:05.333 --> 36:07.200
- I wanna go to Evil Prom!

36:07.300 --> 36:09.067
Phoebe, take him down.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.067
- Your powers are impressive,

36:14.167 --> 36:17.900
but they're no match for this
handsome abnormality.

36:18.067 --> 36:20.900
- Oh, yeah? Well,
what about this power?

36:21.067 --> 36:22.600
See ya!

36:24.500 --> 36:25.967
- Run, if you like,

36:26.067 --> 36:29.067
but you'll never escape
the long arm of the claw!

36:29.133 --> 36:31.067
[evil laughter]

36:31.167 --> 36:32.367
- You're so cute.

36:32.467 --> 36:35.300
Too bad your sister's
a big liar.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.767
Yes, she is.

36:37.867 --> 36:40.100
Oh, does baby want
another bottle?

36:42.833 --> 36:44.433
All right...

36:44.533 --> 36:46.500
Whoa, jumbo baby!

36:50.067 --> 36:51.933
That's not normal.

36:52.067 --> 36:54.733
Phoebe!

36:54.833 --> 36:58.067
Ah!

36:58.167 --> 37:00.900
Come here. Let's go.

37:01.067 --> 37:04.267
- *

37:04.367 --> 37:07.800
- How do you think he puts on
his underwear with that claw?

37:07.900 --> 37:23.767
- *

37:24.867 --> 37:28.533
*

37:28.633 --> 37:30.500
- Well, that was really dumb.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.433
Now you've got nowhere to go.

37:32.533 --> 37:34.167
- Don't I?

37:34.267 --> 37:39.400
- *

37:39.500 --> 37:41.500
- [grappling hook clangs]

37:43.600 --> 37:45.200
- [heavy thud]

37:45.300 --> 37:51.233
- *

37:51.333 --> 37:53.067
- COLOSSO: [screaming]

37:53.167 --> 37:57.933
- *

37:58.067 --> 38:00.167
- Phoebe!

38:00.267 --> 38:01.800
You weren't lying.

38:01.900 --> 38:04.700
I take back everything
I said about your sister.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.867
- Cherry, take the baby
and hide! It's dangerous!

38:06.967 --> 38:09.133
- Ah! I gotcha!
- [gasping]

38:11.433 --> 38:13.100
- Let's get him.
- Yeah.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.933
There's no way he'll be able
to take on the both of us.

38:18.467 --> 38:21.300
- Unless one of us
is a bunny.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.800
- What happened?

38:22.900 --> 38:24.067
- I set the timer
on the animalizer,

38:24.133 --> 38:26.367
but only because I thought
we'd be home by now.

38:26.467 --> 38:27.700
- COLOSSO: Okay, new plan.

38:27.800 --> 38:31.167
You fight and I'll hold
the keys in case you lose.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.467
Good luck, pal-y.

38:33.567 --> 38:36.067
- You're about to become
a flying fish!

38:36.133 --> 38:38.100
- [heavy thud]

38:38.200 --> 38:39.700
I'm not a fish.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.300
I'm aquatic crustacean
on my mother's side.

38:45.167 --> 38:48.400
Say goodbye, Thunder Girl.

38:48.500 --> 38:58.067
- *

38:58.100 --> 39:00.833
- MAX: Let go!
- KING CRAB: You let it go!

39:00.933 --> 39:03.400
- Phoebe, fry him with
your heat breath.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.167
- I can't. It might hit you.

39:05.267 --> 39:07.767
Colosso, tell me everything you
know about that crab claw.

39:07.867 --> 39:11.267
- It's indestructible,
has an unbreakable Kung Fu grip,

39:11.367 --> 39:14.300
ooh, and he loves popping
bubble wrap with it.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.567
- Bubble wrap? How is
that supposed to help me?

39:16.667 --> 39:19.133
Wait a minute!

39:19.233 --> 39:22.067
Cherry?
- Huh?

39:22.167 --> 39:24.233
- I need you to
tickle Chloe now.

39:24.333 --> 39:27.367
- What? Okay.

39:27.467 --> 39:28.700
Coochie-coochie-coo.

39:28.800 --> 39:32.733
Coochie-coochie-coo.
- [bubbles popping]

39:32.833 --> 39:35.500
- Coochie-coochie-coo...

39:35.600 --> 39:37.567
- [bubbles popping]

39:37.667 --> 39:40.233
- Bubbles!

39:40.333 --> 39:43.633
[laughing]

39:43.733 --> 39:45.800
Oh, bubbles!

39:45.900 --> 39:47.967
- Time to burst your bubble.

39:48.067 --> 39:52.567
- KING CRAB: Oh...
[heavy thud]

39:52.667 --> 39:55.800
- Oh, I am so keeping this!

39:55.900 --> 39:59.067
- My claw--it's stuck.

39:59.167 --> 40:03.000
Men, get the butter!

40:03.100 --> 40:06.633
- [blowing frosty air]
- [metal clamp shattering]

40:06.733 --> 40:10.033
- Thanks. Let's
get outta here.

40:10.133 --> 40:11.233
Come on, Colosso.

40:11.333 --> 40:12.767
- Right behind ya.

40:12.867 --> 40:15.233
- You guys were amazing!

40:15.333 --> 40:17.967
- You brought Cherry!

40:18.067 --> 40:21.933
Oh, you're so dead
when we get home.

40:22.033 --> 40:23.867
- Ah. [laughing]

40:23.967 --> 40:25.467
Seal the exits.
- [alarm blaring]

40:25.567 --> 40:28.567
- I need every available villain
to the Hall of Villains now!

40:28.667 --> 40:30.633
- PHOEBE: Run!

40:33.067 --> 40:36.700
- Wait for me!
- I got you, buddy!

40:36.800 --> 40:39.133
No-o-o-o-o-o!

40:39.233 --> 40:42.100
- COLOSSO: [trembling]

40:42.200 --> 40:43.967
- Phoebe, Colosso's
still in there.

40:44.067 --> 40:46.267
- What? Max, you can't.
It's too dangerous.

40:46.367 --> 40:48.833
You'll just have
to let him go.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.433
- [thunderous thud]

40:53.533 --> 40:56.233
Kids!
- Dad! How'd you find us?

40:56.333 --> 40:58.267
- I followed the Thunder
Van's homing signal.

40:58.367 --> 41:00.167
We'll deal with why you're
in Metroburg later.

41:00.267 --> 41:03.133
Right now, I'm just
happy you're okay.

41:03.233 --> 41:06.467
And Cherry!

41:06.567 --> 41:11.500
- Hi, "Thunder Man" Thunderman.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.733
- Sorry, Dad.
She's my bestie.

41:14.833 --> 41:16.467
- Dad, Colosso's in there

41:16.567 --> 41:18.500
about to be bunny
bashed by villains.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.067
- I'll get you a hamster.
Let's go.

41:20.100 --> 41:21.733
- Dad!

41:21.833 --> 41:24.333
Please. Colosso's more
than just my pet,

41:24.433 --> 41:26.767
he's my best friend.

41:26.867 --> 41:29.867
- Oh, you kids and your
best friends. I...

41:29.967 --> 41:31.733
Fine. I'll go save him.

41:31.833 --> 41:33.700
- MAX, PHOEBE, CHERRY:
The password is--

41:33.800 --> 41:35.633
- [thunderous crash]

41:35.733 --> 41:38.267
- Or that.

41:38.367 --> 41:40.533
- Thunder Man.

41:40.633 --> 41:43.933
Well, you've really
let yourself go.

41:44.067 --> 41:48.933
- *

41:49.067 --> 41:50.800
- I'm sorry that
I didn't believe you.

41:50.900 --> 41:53.700
- No, I'm sorry.
Lying is never the answer.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.367
Oh, by the way,

41:55.467 --> 41:57.567
you have to lie to everyone
about our superpowers.

41:57.667 --> 42:00.200
- Done!

42:00.300 --> 42:03.800
- *

42:03.900 --> 42:05.833
- Colosso, you're all right.

42:05.933 --> 42:08.567
- I am--thanks to your Dad.

42:08.667 --> 42:11.433
- Hero League, I've got some
trash that needs to be picked up

42:11.533 --> 42:13.633
at the old broccoli factory.

42:13.733 --> 42:15.667
Oh, no, no, not actual trash.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.667
I'm trying to sound cool.

42:17.767 --> 42:20.367
- Ooh, I've got this
awesome backpack!

42:20.467 --> 42:21.667
Look, it has a button.

42:21.767 --> 42:24.833
[screaming]
[zooming]

42:24.933 --> 42:26.633
- Well, that takes care
of that problem.

42:26.733 --> 42:28.433
- Dad!

42:28.533 --> 42:29.633
- Kidding.

42:29.733 --> 42:32.233
Thunder Man, away!

42:32.333 --> 42:34.133
- CHERRY: [screaming]

42:37.267 --> 42:40.067
- So, Max turned Dr. Colosso
back into a human,

42:40.167 --> 42:42.267
Phoebe told Cherry
our family secret,

42:42.367 --> 42:44.467
and Nora's been banned
from the baby store?

42:44.567 --> 42:46.333
- Yep.
- That's right.

42:46.433 --> 42:47.967
- Uh-huh.
- Correct.

42:48.067 --> 42:50.333
- Oh, good. So I didn't
miss anything.

42:50.433 --> 42:52.600
- Just my people butt, Barb.

42:52.700 --> 42:56.267
It was spectacular!

42:56.367 --> 42:57.867
- Enough about your butt.

42:57.967 --> 43:01.967
Can we just take
the picture already?

43:02.067 --> 43:04.400
- Smile for the camera, Chloe.

43:04.500 --> 43:06.200
Smile.
[laughing]

43:06.300 --> 43:08.300
Tickle. Tickle. Tickle.
- [bubbles popping]

43:08.400 --> 43:09.733
- BARB: Oh!

43:09.833 --> 43:11.733
- Hey, you activated
her superpower.

43:11.833 --> 43:14.233
- Aw, she has bubble power.

43:14.333 --> 43:17.900
That's so cute.

43:18.067 --> 43:19.867
- Hm, the bubbles
