01:04.910 --> 01:08.050
- Hey, fella.

01:08.050 --> 01:12.490
Thanks for your service.

01:57.490 --> 01:59.290
- Circa
the battle of Gettysburg.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.340
- Perfect backup weapon
for you, Dawson.

02:01.770 --> 02:03.670
.41 caliber stops your average

02:03.870 --> 02:05.540
sumo wrestler in his tracks.

02:05.540 --> 02:07.040
Tucks neatly in a Fanny pack.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.310
Man purse.
- Sports bra, g-string, thong.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.560
I'd like to turn in a gun.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.660
Yeah, let's take a look.

02:17.830 --> 02:20.730
- Where'd you serve?
- Iraq.

02:20.730 --> 02:22.800
Two tours.

02:26.570 --> 02:28.570
I'm glad that's over, man.

02:28.570 --> 02:30.510
I was sweating' bullets
walking around with that thing.

02:30.510 --> 02:32.410
I mean, if I got stopped,
you know?

02:32.410 --> 02:35.410
It'd have been real bad.

02:35.410 --> 02:38.510
- Thing's jammed.
- Let me see.

02:39.580 --> 02:40.960
- I still get the money
even though it's broke?

02:40.980 --> 02:42.750
- Absolutely.
- Cool.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.950
My nephew wants a clarinet
for his birthday.

02:44.950 --> 02:47.920
I figured
this would cover a used one.

02:50.630 --> 02:53.690
- On the barrel.
Is that...

02:59.600 --> 03:00.870
- you have to come with us.

03:00.870 --> 03:03.000
- Why, what'd I do?

03:03.460 --> 03:05.540
- You see the dots?

03:05.560 --> 03:06.620
That's blood spatter.

03:06.780 --> 03:07.540
- What?

03:07.710 --> 03:09.970
- I'm pretty sure
your gun has a body on it.

03:09.970 --> 03:13.080
Oh, shoot.

03:26.810 --> 03:28.780
- The radio said bring any gun
to the church today

03:28.930 --> 03:30.770
and get $100.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.470
A'ight?
So that's what I did.

03:32.470 --> 03:33.800
- All true, Mr. Williams,

03:33.800 --> 03:35.600
but your gun
has dried blood on it, and...

03:35.610 --> 03:37.470
- it's not my gun.

03:37.470 --> 03:39.570
- Whose gun is it?

03:41.710 --> 03:43.480
- I don't really know.
I found it.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.210
- Where?

03:45.220 --> 03:47.720
Well...

03:47.750 --> 03:49.650
I was waiting for the bus
early this morning,

03:51.040 --> 03:53.440
and I...

03:53.560 --> 03:55.190
I threw away some chewing gum,

03:55.190 --> 03:57.160
and it was laying right...
Right there in a...

03:57.160 --> 03:59.160
A trash barrel.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.530
- Your heart seems to be in
the right place, Mr. Williams,

04:01.530 --> 04:03.930
but this story, to be honest,
sounds like bs.

04:03.930 --> 04:05.630
- I'm telling you,
it isn't mine.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.540
- Then the last thing we want

04:07.540 --> 04:08.940
is someone blaming you

04:08.940 --> 04:10.840
when they find
their gun missing.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.570
- Can I just go home?
I'll give back the money.

04:12.580 --> 04:13.940
- The money's yours.

04:13.940 --> 04:15.540
- Yeah, but you're not leaving

04:15.550 --> 04:16.910
until we know
where you got that gun.

04:16.910 --> 04:18.110
- All right.
- Get up.

04:18.110 --> 04:20.209
- All right.

04:25.190 --> 04:26.920
I...

04:26.920 --> 04:30.660
I was fixing
my nephew's bed this morning.

04:30.660 --> 04:33.590
And then that's when I found it
under the mattress.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.100
- Your nephew
the clarinet player?

04:35.100 --> 04:36.960
- No, his name's Andre.

04:36.970 --> 04:39.100
A'ight? He's a good kid.
Made all a's last year.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.240
Never been in any kind
of trouble with the police.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.140
When I saw that gun
under Andre's bed,

04:43.140 --> 04:45.040
you know,
it scared the hell out of me,

04:45.040 --> 04:47.110
and believe me,
when he comes home from school,

04:47.110 --> 04:50.180
I'm gon' get
to the bottom of this.

04:52.650 --> 04:55.080
- Is my uncle
in some kind of trouble?

04:55.080 --> 04:57.080
- That depends on how this goes.

04:57.090 --> 04:59.690
He found your gun.

04:59.690 --> 05:00.920
- What gun?

05:01.960 --> 05:04.230
- The one under your mattress.

05:04.230 --> 05:06.130
- But I don't know
anything about that.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.700
- I mean, if he found it,
I didn't put it there.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.630
- So you want your uncle
to take the weight for this?

05:12.640 --> 05:14.070
- No, ma'am.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.040
- You shot somebody,
didn't you, Andre?

05:17.040 --> 05:19.170
- Shot? No, sir.

05:19.180 --> 05:21.140
- If that gun was used
to shoot somebody,

05:21.140 --> 05:23.080
we're gonna find out.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.080
Maybe we can help you now.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.680
But once we walk out of here,
all bets are off.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.950
Do you understand?

05:34.590 --> 05:36.690
- Bad decision, Andre.

05:40.260 --> 05:42.360
- Get back to class.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.300
- The serial number tracks

05:45.300 --> 05:48.000
an Indiana gun store sale
in '89.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.670
Looks like somebody's been
playing street hockey

05:49.670 --> 05:51.370
with it ever since.
- It's still operable?

05:51.370 --> 05:53.370
- Ballistics says
it fires just fine.

05:53.380 --> 05:55.380
Loading, not so much.

05:55.380 --> 05:57.210
The spring on
the magazine release

05:57.210 --> 06:00.110
is shot to hell.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.120
Latent didn't find
any prints on the weapon

06:02.120 --> 06:04.190
other than the e-lims
you provided.

06:04.190 --> 06:07.050
- What about the blood?
Did we get a DNA hit?

06:07.060 --> 06:09.060
- As a matter of fact...

06:11.060 --> 06:12.390
Damon cafferty.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.060
Age 19.

06:14.060 --> 06:15.130
Two priors.

06:15.130 --> 06:17.230
- Can I get in there?

06:23.040 --> 06:24.410
That's a gang tatt.

06:24.410 --> 06:26.970
Pd killaz.
They roll out of englewood.

06:26.980 --> 06:29.110
- Damon cafferty's the banger
that wouldn't cooperate

06:29.110 --> 06:31.010
in the Lara Haley shooting.

06:31.010 --> 06:33.110
- Stone's just starting
that trial now.

06:36.220 --> 06:37.950
- Part of our opening statement

06:37.950 --> 06:39.350
will be making
an emotional connection

06:39.360 --> 06:41.120
with our jurors.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.020
- I'll be telling them
about your daughter.

06:43.030 --> 06:45.160
Taking them through
what happened to her that day.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.760
It may be hard for you to hear.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.200
- We'll be all right.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.330
- If you need to step out
at any time...

06:51.330 --> 06:54.340
- we live with this
every single day.

06:54.340 --> 06:56.440
- I was holding Lara's hand...

06:57.670 --> 07:00.110
When the shooting started.

07:00.110 --> 07:03.710
The sidewalk outside our home
where she was shot...

07:03.710 --> 07:06.110
The blood is still...
- I'm really sorry

07:06.120 --> 07:08.250
to do this to you, Mrs. Haley,

07:08.250 --> 07:10.250
but it helps that you're here.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.720
- We'll do what we need to do
to see the person who did this

07:12.720 --> 07:14.720
go to jail.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.160
- Thank you. So will we.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.430
- Mr. stone?

07:18.430 --> 07:20.330
Hi. Hope I'm not interrupting.

07:20.330 --> 07:22.130
Kerry schmidt.
Cook county public defender.

07:22.130 --> 07:24.130
I'll be taking over
the defense case.

07:24.130 --> 07:26.270
Hey, Anna.
- Hi.

07:26.270 --> 07:28.140
Kerry was one year behind me
at Michigan law.

07:28.140 --> 07:30.100
- Uh, two.

07:30.110 --> 07:32.740
Believe it or not, this is
my very first murder trial.

07:32.740 --> 07:36.040
Butterflies, you know?

07:36.050 --> 07:38.180
So, uh, I would be
more than grateful for

07:38.180 --> 07:41.020
any professional courtesies
you might throw my way.

07:41.020 --> 07:43.120
Not that I'm looking for you
to take it easy on me.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.020
- Okay, then.
You can meet the haleys.

07:47.020 --> 07:48.290
They're the parents
of the little girl

07:48.290 --> 07:50.390
your client killed.

07:55.130 --> 07:56.800
On the afternoon of July 11th,

07:56.800 --> 07:58.430
Lara Haley was walking home
from summer school

07:58.430 --> 08:00.300
with her mom, corrine.

08:00.300 --> 08:03.170
It's a walk they've taken
a hundred times before.

08:03.170 --> 08:05.310
It was just another average day.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.310
They talked about
Lara's science classes,

08:07.310 --> 08:09.440
and what they'd cook for dinner.

08:09.450 --> 08:13.080
But it was the last average day
that Lara would ever have.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.480
And the last moment
that corrine Haley

08:14.480 --> 08:16.120
would ever spend
with her daughter.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.450
'Cause a few hours earlier,

08:17.450 --> 08:20.860
this man, Chris Stackhouse,

08:20.860 --> 08:22.390
a member of
a south side street gang

08:22.390 --> 08:24.160
known as the drexel posse,

08:24.160 --> 08:25.830
found an instagram message
on his phone

08:25.830 --> 08:27.830
from a rival gang.

08:27.830 --> 08:31.270
It said, and I'm paraphrasing
some rough language here,

08:31.270 --> 08:34.270
"had sex with
your girlfriend last night.

08:34.270 --> 08:36.400
Hahaha."

08:36.409 --> 08:38.770
Attached to the message
was a photograph

08:38.780 --> 08:41.409
of a half naked young lady.

08:41.409 --> 08:44.210
The defendant then grabbed
a .9 millimeter handgun,

08:44.210 --> 08:47.210
pulled a hoodie over his head,
and rode his bike to the corner

08:47.220 --> 08:49.350
of 68th street
and marshfield Avenue,

08:49.350 --> 08:52.120
where he opened fire on
a group of rival gang members

08:52.120 --> 08:53.850
who charmingly call themselves

08:53.860 --> 08:56.860
pd killaz.

08:56.860 --> 09:00.190
The man he was gunning for,
Damon cafferty, was wounded.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.330
But a stray bullet
from the defendant's gun

09:03.330 --> 09:05.330
tore into Lara's back,
killing her

09:05.330 --> 09:07.270
as corrine cradled her
in her arms

09:07.270 --> 09:10.370
and felt the life
drain out of her daughter.

09:13.810 --> 09:15.440
- They're still not answering.
- What courtroom?

09:15.440 --> 09:17.180
- 304.

09:18.810 --> 09:22.520
- Yes, this is a very tragic
situation for Lara's parents.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.920
I mean,
not just for her parents,

09:23.920 --> 09:25.850
but for all of us.
Really.

09:25.860 --> 09:27.860
But when you look at
the evidence logically...

09:27.860 --> 09:29.560
- Stone!
- It will show that my client

09:29.560 --> 09:32.890
did not fire the firearm
that killed that poor girl.

09:32.900 --> 09:35.900
- We just found
your murder weapon.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.200
It was in another kid's bedroom.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.600
- What?
- In fact, he was nowhere near...

09:40.600 --> 09:42.440
Your honor,
I'm addressing the jury here.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.540
- I'm sorry,
would you bear with us, please?

09:47.380 --> 09:48.840
- Are you sure?

09:48.850 --> 09:50.210
- Damon cafferty's blood spatter

09:50.210 --> 09:52.210
is on the business end
of the gun.

09:52.220 --> 09:55.320
- Looks like you might have
the wrong kid on trial here.

10:02.290 --> 10:05.160
- The ballistic tests
confirmed it.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.890
Lara Haley was killed
with a bullet from

10:06.900 --> 10:09.260
the weapon turned in at
the gun buy-back.

10:09.270 --> 10:11.270
- It's like the wild west
out there, and we can't get

10:11.270 --> 10:13.130
a simple murder case right.
Thought you had this.

10:13.140 --> 10:16.870
- We knew there were
a few problems going in.

10:16.870 --> 10:19.140
- You call this a problem?
- There's no need to panic.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.140
Just because some other kid was
babysitting the murder weapon,

10:21.140 --> 10:23.580
doesn't mean the shooter isn't
sitting at the defense table.

10:23.580 --> 10:25.580
- Is the boy who had the gun
in the same street gang

10:25.580 --> 10:27.580
as the defendant?
- Not as far as we know.

10:27.580 --> 10:29.320
He seems to be a model citizen.

10:29.320 --> 10:32.290
- So what was the gun doing
under his mattress?

10:32.290 --> 10:34.120
- We'll get a continuance.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.220
It'll buy us some time
to find more answers.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.630
- What makes you think
judge sanford

10:41.630 --> 10:43.230
will Grant us a continuance?

10:43.230 --> 10:45.600
- Newly discovered evidence.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.940
- So you're going to let
schmidt know about the gun?

10:47.940 --> 10:49.640
- I want a conviction
as much as anybody.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.370
Don't you think we need
to disclose that we found

10:51.370 --> 10:53.210
the murder weapon?
- You just told jefferies

10:53.210 --> 10:54.640
it's not exculpatory.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.210
- If you were defense counsel,

10:56.210 --> 10:57.650
wouldn't you want
to know about this?

10:57.650 --> 10:59.650
- Landmark case
of state v. Jagger.

10:59.650 --> 11:01.380
You can't always get
what you want.

11:01.380 --> 11:03.250
- Law's not rock 'n' roll.

11:03.250 --> 11:05.020
We play by the rules,
and we err on the side of

11:05.020 --> 11:07.420
do unto others.
- Gospel. Not my jam.

11:07.420 --> 11:09.420
- My client wants
his day in court.

11:09.430 --> 11:11.190
Enough delays already.

11:11.190 --> 11:12.660
- Why do you need
more time, Mr. stone?

11:12.660 --> 11:14.230
- Our investigators
just recovered the gun

11:14.230 --> 11:15.660
that killed Lara Haley.

11:15.670 --> 11:17.030
- Where?

11:17.030 --> 11:19.030
- In another teenager's bedroom.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.600
- Forget about a continuance.
I'm moving for a dismissal.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.600
- No, that's ridiculous.
Our case is still viable.

11:22.610 --> 11:24.140
- My client's been swearing
up and down he didn't do this.

11:24.140 --> 11:25.410
- He bragged about it.

11:25.410 --> 11:27.240
He's been ID'd.
- And I'm hearing

11:27.240 --> 11:29.010
your star witness is
the neighborhood crackhead.

11:29.010 --> 11:30.410
- We don't want to see
an innocent man convicted

11:30.410 --> 11:31.980
any more than Ms. schmidt does.

11:31.980 --> 11:34.320
We need a week to investigate.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.320
- You've got 72 hours.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.990
- In light of this development,
judge, my client should be

11:37.990 --> 11:39.350
released without bail.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.360
- Well,
the people strongly oppose.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.190
I'll release him,

11:45.190 --> 11:46.690
but I'm ordering that
he be restricted to his home.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.360
You understand that,
Ms. schmidt?

11:48.360 --> 11:50.660
If I hear that he puts
one foot on the street,

11:50.670 --> 11:53.000
he goes back to county,
and I'll slap a contempt finding

11:53.000 --> 11:55.100
on both of you.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.710
- I don't see why this guy
can't just call an uber.

12:01.710 --> 12:03.340
- You have something
better to do?

12:03.350 --> 12:07.250
- Than running a car service
for a murderer?

12:07.250 --> 12:09.980
Bogey. Two o'clock.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.250
- You're here
to transport my client?

12:12.250 --> 12:14.250
- That's what
the court order says.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.390
- You know you're not allowed
to ask him any questions, right?

12:16.390 --> 12:18.160
- Was that in the order?

12:18.160 --> 12:20.060
- It's in the fifth amendment.

12:20.060 --> 12:21.430
- I have an idea.

12:21.430 --> 12:23.230
Why don't you ride along
with us to englewood?

12:23.230 --> 12:25.000
Make sure we don't violate
any of your client's

12:25.000 --> 12:26.430
constitutional rights.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.540
- It's okay.

12:30.470 --> 12:33.370
- Stackhouse!

12:33.380 --> 12:36.210
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Get in the car.

12:36.210 --> 12:38.010
- Oh, remember, Chris.

12:38.010 --> 12:40.210
Home restriction.
- Yeah. Yeah, it's all good.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.220
Look. Do me a favor.
Drop me off on Ashland.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.120
I don't wanna be rolling' up
on my block with pd.

12:44.120 --> 12:47.220
- Not a chance. You're getting
door-to-door service.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.400
- You heard your lawyer.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.170
Get inside, stay inside.

12:58.170 --> 12:59.800
- Yeah. All right.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.240
- We'll be back to pick you up
Friday morning.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.440
- Yo, stack, what up, man?
- Hey, yo, what up?

13:10.450 --> 13:12.550
- Can you believe
this knucklehead?

13:16.150 --> 13:18.250
- Hey! Stackhouse!

13:21.290 --> 13:23.220
- P-d-k drilling' snitches
today.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.270
- Go! I got it!

13:38.440 --> 13:40.070
- 10-71. Shots fired.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.380
One down.

13:41.380 --> 13:44.480
Need an ambo
at 62nd and wolcott.

13:46.550 --> 13:48.850
- Chris Stackhouse
took one round to the thigh.

13:48.850 --> 13:50.520
He's being treated
at Chicago med,

13:50.520 --> 13:52.520
but no reason
he can't limp back into court

13:52.520 --> 13:54.150
when the trial resumes.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.320
- Our shooter
jumped on the Ryan.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.220
We lost him in traffic.

13:57.230 --> 13:59.090
- I don't suppose you got
a dmv hit on the plate?

13:59.100 --> 14:01.360
- It's stolen. We'll lift prints
when the vehicle turns up.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.230
- We're pulling
known pdk mug shots

14:03.230 --> 14:04.600
to see if we can
put a name to the face.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.230
- What about posting up
on their turf?

14:06.240 --> 14:07.530
Maybe you can spot the shooter.

14:07.540 --> 14:08.840
- It's not great timing.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.440
Stackhouse's release lit a spark

14:10.440 --> 14:12.240
between pdk
and the drexel posse.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.440
- Why?

14:13.440 --> 14:15.180
- 'Cause a banger who skates out

14:15.180 --> 14:17.440
from under a murder charge
looks like a snitch.

14:17.450 --> 14:20.210
- There were three shootings
in englewood just last night.

14:20.220 --> 14:22.420
Four wounded. One pdk kid dead.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.120
- Bystanders?

14:24.120 --> 14:25.520
- A pedestrian caught a round
in his neck.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.420
Missed his jugular
by a half inch.

14:27.420 --> 14:28.790
- The district
has its hands full.

14:28.790 --> 14:30.890
There is a surge in place.

14:37.230 --> 14:40.330
- The mag release
on that thing's shot.

14:41.900 --> 14:46.240
- All right. Voight and his crew
can jump on the drive-by.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.410
There's a ticking clock
on the Haley trial.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.150
- Andre had nothing to do

14:51.150 --> 14:53.150
with that little girl
getting killed.

14:53.150 --> 14:54.880
All right?
He's not in a gang.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.880
He goes to school,
and he comes home.

14:56.890 --> 14:58.890
I don't let him leave the house
without me going with him.

14:58.890 --> 15:01.260
- The principal at Harper speaks
very highly of your nephew.

15:01.260 --> 15:03.420
But the fact remains,
he had a gun under his bed.

15:03.430 --> 15:05.290
- Which I turned in.

15:05.290 --> 15:07.560
- A gun that was used in
the homicide of Lara Haley.

15:09.870 --> 15:11.330
- We can
have him arrested right now

15:11.330 --> 15:13.300
while we sort this out.
- Oh, no.

15:13.300 --> 15:14.940
Please don't do that.
- So if there's an explanation

15:14.940 --> 15:16.940
for this, now's the time.

15:16.940 --> 15:18.940
I know this is hard,
Mr. Williams.

15:18.940 --> 15:21.680
- You're asking me to throw
another boy to the lions?

15:21.680 --> 15:23.340
- It's your choice,

15:23.350 --> 15:25.180
but it looks to me
like Andre's a young man

15:25.180 --> 15:28.320
who has a shot to make
a life for himself.

15:28.320 --> 15:31.420
You can protect this other kid,
or you can be straight with us.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.960
- The day the girl was shot,

15:39.960 --> 15:41.900
Andre's cousin, keo,
came to the house.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.500
Keo Vincent.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.400
And, uh, he said he was, uh,

15:45.400 --> 15:47.500
coming from the playground
and needed to shower.

15:48.570 --> 15:50.540
- To scrub off gunshot residue?

15:51.570 --> 15:53.340
- Or a sweaty kid
who needed to wash up.

15:53.340 --> 15:54.940
- He had something
in a lunch bag

15:54.940 --> 15:56.340
that he gave to Andre.
All right?

15:56.350 --> 15:57.610
Something heavy.

15:57.610 --> 16:00.510
- About the size of a gun?

16:00.520 --> 16:02.480
- Yes, ma'am.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.890
And when he left here,
he was wearing Andre's clothes.

16:04.890 --> 16:06.890
- Why didn't you tell this
to our investigators?

16:06.890 --> 16:08.620
- All right, look.
You have to understand.

16:08.620 --> 16:11.460
Keo is my sister's only child.

16:11.460 --> 16:13.560
All right? Family.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.330
But between you and me,

16:16.330 --> 16:18.300
kid's been in
some trouble before.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.440
- Where do we find keo?

16:24.740 --> 16:26.970
- This is
drexel posse territory.

16:29.710 --> 16:31.250
- It's the kid in
the white tank top.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.310
The chief keef wannabe.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.950
- Keo.

16:35.950 --> 16:37.950
Yo, keo!

16:37.950 --> 16:39.390
- What?

16:39.390 --> 16:41.390
- Talk to you for a minute.

16:41.390 --> 16:42.920
- I'm busy.

16:42.930 --> 16:44.660
- All right.
You gon' make me come over there

16:44.660 --> 16:46.760
and see who all's got warrants?

16:52.500 --> 16:54.430
- Yeah?

16:54.440 --> 16:56.270
- These gentlemen here are with
the state's attorney.

16:56.270 --> 16:58.410
They want to talk to you
about Chris Stackhouse.

16:58.410 --> 16:59.670
- He's locked up.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.540
- Not anymore.
He just got shot.

17:02.540 --> 17:04.680
- There's a lot of that
going around.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.650
- He said you were with him
on marshfield a few months ago

17:06.650 --> 17:08.579
when that little girl
got killed.

17:08.579 --> 17:10.420
- I don't think so.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.990
Check it. Man says c-stax trying
to put a case on me.

17:13.990 --> 17:15.560
That's hella cold.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.420
- No one said anything
about a case.

17:17.430 --> 17:19.430
- You ain't come all the way
out here for the scenery.

17:19.430 --> 17:20.960
- I think we need
to discuss this

17:20.960 --> 17:22.960
where we have
your full attention.

17:22.970 --> 17:24.970
- Are you arresting me?

17:24.970 --> 17:28.069
'Cause I didn't drill nobody.

17:38.780 --> 17:41.780
I guess black lives do matter.

17:41.780 --> 17:45.050
- Chill out, keo.

17:49.390 --> 17:51.930
- Keo had six juvie arrests
by the age of 15.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.830
He did a bid at jdc.

17:53.830 --> 17:55.830
He's suspected
of being cliqued up

17:55.830 --> 17:58.570
with a drexel posse crew
on his block.

17:58.570 --> 18:00.070
- A junior associate?

18:00.070 --> 18:01.900
- A kid who'd try to make
a name for himself

18:01.900 --> 18:03.840
by spraying bullets
at a rival gang.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.740
- Yeah. With an attitude
to match his ambition.

18:05.740 --> 18:07.370
If this little wise-ass
killed Lara Haley,

18:07.380 --> 18:09.110
he's going away for a long time.

18:09.110 --> 18:11.650
- We've got an all-out war now
between drexel posse and pdk.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.050
- Gang intel sent me this

18:13.050 --> 18:15.050
after Stackhouse got shot
a couple of days ago.

18:15.050 --> 18:18.050
A gang member from pdk
posted an instagram

18:18.050 --> 18:20.850
threatening Stackhouse
ten minutes before he was shot.

18:20.860 --> 18:23.860
Drexel retaliates
by shooting three pdk bangers.

18:23.860 --> 18:26.860
And then they posted photos
of it on social media.

18:26.860 --> 18:30.600
The two gangs tweet some insults
back and forth, and finally,

18:30.600 --> 18:31.930
there's a challenge
to throw down

18:31.930 --> 18:33.930
by the railroad tracks
near lindblom park.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.940
"Pdk bitches gonna bleed."

18:36.940 --> 18:38.840
- Bottom line...
Three dead, five wounded.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.110
All in the space of eight hours.

18:40.110 --> 18:41.740
- So basically, they're inciting

18:41.740 --> 18:43.140
these retaliations
on social media?

18:43.150 --> 18:45.050
- Uh-huh.
That's how these crews roll now.

18:45.050 --> 18:47.050
You call out a rival in a dm.

18:47.050 --> 18:48.420
Drop a dis video.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.620
Geo-tag your turf.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.020
Shoot. Rinse. Repeat.

18:51.020 --> 18:52.990
- Cyber-banging.

18:52.990 --> 18:56.090
- Makes "boyz n the hood"
look like a Disney movie.

19:02.130 --> 19:04.770
- Cell tower pings put
keo Vincent on the block

19:04.770 --> 19:06.170
when Lara Haley was killed.

19:06.170 --> 19:08.170
I'm getting this strong feeling

19:08.170 --> 19:11.770
we actually do have the wrong
drexel posse banger on trial.

19:11.770 --> 19:14.780
- Yeah. You and me both.

19:14.780 --> 19:17.880
Here. Check this out.

19:19.010 --> 19:20.750
- Your cell phone account?

19:20.750 --> 19:22.480
- It's my user agreement.
Read that.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.920
- "The customer agrees not to
use the phone or the account

19:24.920 --> 19:27.050
for any unlawful purpose."

19:27.060 --> 19:28.920
- I'd say
orchestrating a gang war

19:28.920 --> 19:30.190
in a series of digital messages

19:30.190 --> 19:33.830
qualifies as
an unlawful purpose.

19:33.830 --> 19:36.830
- Maybe, but
it'll take years to litigate.

19:36.830 --> 19:39.930
- And that's why
I'm shutting off their phones.

19:44.470 --> 19:46.770
- Let's see if
I understand this, Mr. stone.

19:46.780 --> 19:48.510
You want to
unilaterally terminate

19:48.510 --> 19:52.080
cellular and Internet service
for 39 individuals.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.680
- Individuals who are known
violent gang members

19:54.680 --> 19:56.820
in your jurisdiction.
- Known by whom?

19:56.820 --> 19:59.090
- The Chicago pd maintains
a strategic subject list.

19:59.090 --> 20:01.090
It's more commonly called
the heat list.

20:01.090 --> 20:03.090
It ranks past offenders
who are most likely

20:03.090 --> 20:05.090
to perpetrate gun violence
in the future.

20:05.090 --> 20:06.860
- Who makes this list?

20:06.860 --> 20:08.500
- It's based on
a computer algorithm

20:08.500 --> 20:10.930
developed by the Illinois
institute of technology.

20:10.930 --> 20:13.830
- So you're telling me
some computer wonk

20:13.840 --> 20:16.240
on a college campus
can predict the future?

20:16.240 --> 20:17.870
- Yes, your honor.

20:17.870 --> 20:19.510
Young men at the top
of the heat list

20:19.510 --> 20:21.780
are shooting each other
in englewood as we speak.

20:21.780 --> 20:23.780
- And how's turning off
their smartphones

20:23.780 --> 20:25.880
gonna stop them
from killing each other?

20:28.220 --> 20:30.850
- As you can see from
these social media messages

20:30.850 --> 20:32.990
we've pulled,
the violence is being fueled by

20:32.990 --> 20:35.260
these gang members
on their devices.

20:35.260 --> 20:37.560
- Well...

20:38.960 --> 20:42.230
You have whet my appetite.

20:42.230 --> 20:44.560
I'll Grant a full hearing
on your request

20:44.570 --> 20:46.870
for injunctive relief,

20:46.870 --> 20:48.870
but in addition to
the service providers

20:48.870 --> 20:52.540
you've named,
I want the Illinois aclu here

20:52.540 --> 20:54.840
on behalf of
the account holders.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.980
We'll put it on the calendar
for next Friday.

20:57.980 --> 21:00.180
- Thank you, but this needs
to be heard tomorrow

21:00.180 --> 21:02.080
before there's more blood
on the street.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.180
We can have all the parties
notified within the hour.

21:06.990 --> 21:09.260
- I can't walk across the hall
without taking my cell phone.

21:09.260 --> 21:11.890
- But you don't use it
to light up your neighbor.

21:11.890 --> 21:14.760
- Maybe there's a way
to do this more surgically.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.260
File complaints with
the social media apps

21:16.270 --> 21:18.100
they're using.
- I can name ten

21:18.100 --> 21:20.030
messaging applications
off the top of my head.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.040
These gang members can migrate
from one to the next

21:22.040 --> 21:24.170
as easily as I can change
the brand of beer I order.

21:24.170 --> 21:26.310
We don't have time to play
whack-a-mole with these killers.

21:26.310 --> 21:29.210
- Whoa! It was just a thought.

21:29.210 --> 21:32.310
- This city's buried
too many of its children.

21:43.290 --> 21:45.960
- You're trying to do what?

21:45.960 --> 21:47.090
- I don't know.

21:47.100 --> 21:48.560
Save a few lives, maybe.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.560
- By turning off
people's cell phones?

21:50.570 --> 21:52.570
- We can't just sit up here
and be reactive.

21:52.570 --> 21:54.570
We try a few cases,
and we move on to the next,

21:54.570 --> 21:56.340
and it doesn't make a dent.

21:56.340 --> 21:58.170
What's happening now in
the south side of Chicago...

21:58.170 --> 22:00.170
Right now, tonight...
Is a public emergency,

22:00.180 --> 22:02.940
and we need to think
outside the box.

22:02.950 --> 22:04.840
- The last thing I need

22:04.850 --> 22:06.980
is the fcc
breathing down my neck.

22:06.980 --> 22:08.820
- So we'll just sit on our hands
and let these kids

22:08.820 --> 22:10.250
kill each other
over a few blocks of turf.

22:10.250 --> 22:12.090
- Come on, you know
there's middle ground

22:12.090 --> 22:14.990
between doing nothing and this.

22:14.990 --> 22:16.890
- Why not try to stop
the worst offenders

22:16.890 --> 22:19.360
from perpetrating this violence
before it happens?

22:19.360 --> 22:20.990
- Back in the day,
they called that

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
"rounding up
the usual suspects."

22:24.000 --> 22:27.230
This is nothing new.
It's just high tech profiling.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.240
- Using race-neutral criteria.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.840
Felony histories,
gang affiliations.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.110
- Who's in the gangs?

22:33.110 --> 22:34.870
- The shooters.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.280
- People of color.

22:37.280 --> 22:41.620
- Lara Haley was
a person of color.

22:41.620 --> 22:43.320
I can't get their guns,

22:43.320 --> 22:45.150
but maybe I can get
the phones they're using

22:45.150 --> 22:46.920
to help kill each other,
or any other innocent kid

22:46.920 --> 22:48.920
who just happens to be nearby.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.030
Torrent downloaded from RARBG.

22:53.130 --> 22:55.130
Okay.

22:55.130 --> 22:58.130
I'm not gonna pull the plug
on you, Peter.

22:58.130 --> 23:01.030
But if the justice department
comes knocking on my door

23:01.040 --> 23:02.640
with a civil rights complaint,

23:02.640 --> 23:04.240
I'll throw you under the bus
so damn fast,

23:04.240 --> 23:06.010
it'll make your head spin.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.970
- Understood.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.380
- And god help you
if someone dies

23:10.380 --> 23:13.210
because one of these kids
can't use their cell phone

23:13.220 --> 23:15.320
in an emergency.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.990
- One the aclu's
biggest problems with

23:25.990 --> 23:27.960
the heat list is transparency.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.900
The police won't reveal
all of the criteria they used

23:29.900 --> 23:32.800
for the algorithm,
or say who's on the list,

23:32.800 --> 23:34.070
never mind provide

23:34.070 --> 23:36.070
basic due process
to challenge it.

23:36.070 --> 23:38.370
The city of Chicago
has demonized hundreds

23:38.370 --> 23:40.370
of young men in secret.

23:40.380 --> 23:42.310
- And what about the fact that

23:42.310 --> 23:44.840
the state's attorney wants to
shut down their smartphones?

23:44.850 --> 23:46.750
- The last time I looked,
there was something called

23:46.750 --> 23:49.280
the first amendment.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.280
- The U.S. supreme court
decided last year

23:51.290 --> 23:53.350
that the Internet
is a public utility.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.290
So my company
can't pick and choose

23:55.290 --> 23:57.020
who we provide service to.

23:57.030 --> 23:59.290
- But isn't it a fact that
users who issue death threats

23:59.290 --> 24:01.900
are violating the terms
of their customer agreement?

24:01.900 --> 24:03.800
- Maybe yes, maybe no.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.070
That's a contractual matter
for us to decide.

24:06.070 --> 24:07.970
Not you.

24:07.970 --> 24:09.440
- Are you suggesting this court
doesn't have the authority

24:09.440 --> 24:11.400
to order these terminations?

24:11.410 --> 24:13.010
- I wouldn't have a problem
if the consumer could appeal

24:13.010 --> 24:15.440
the shut off,
but you're just speculating.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.910
- A ten-year-old girl
named Lara Haley was murdered

24:17.910 --> 24:21.750
in a shooting instigated on
your company's wireless service.

24:21.750 --> 24:24.850
How is that speculation?

24:28.760 --> 24:30.890
- Is there anything else,
Mr. stone?

24:30.890 --> 24:33.030
- No further questions,
your honor.

24:33.030 --> 24:37.130
Oh, just one more thing.

24:52.150 --> 24:54.780
- The state's attorney
is asking for

24:54.780 --> 24:58.920
novel and unprecedented relief.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.190
But the record number
of dead and wounded

25:01.190 --> 25:03.820
is also unprecedented.

25:03.830 --> 25:07.460
And they are more
than statistics.

25:07.460 --> 25:11.200
These are young lives
being snuffed out.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.770
Parents grieving.

25:12.770 --> 25:16.170
A community gripped by fear.

25:16.170 --> 25:19.070
If I get reversed on appeal,
so be it.

25:19.070 --> 25:22.210
But I find that there is
no constitutional right

25:22.210 --> 25:24.510
to operate a smartphone
that is being utilized

25:24.510 --> 25:26.110
as a deadly weapon.

25:26.110 --> 25:29.120
Shut down these 39 accounts
immediately.

25:35.790 --> 25:37.420
- Here you go,

25:37.430 --> 25:39.430
39 end of service confirmations
from the companies.

25:39.430 --> 25:41.430
- There's some unhappy bangers
on the south side tonight.

25:41.430 --> 25:43.130
- And the aclu's
notice of appeal.

25:43.130 --> 25:44.800
- Slow play our response.

25:44.800 --> 25:45.900
We want to milk
these terminations

25:45.900 --> 25:47.430
as long as we can.

25:47.440 --> 25:48.800
- You have no idea
if this is going to work.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.540
- I'm not expecting a miracle,

25:50.540 --> 25:52.240
but if we can ratchet down
the gang war in englewood,

25:52.240 --> 25:53.970
it was worth it.
- Hopefully,

25:53.980 --> 25:56.080
we didn't win the war,
and lose the battle.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.480
- Thank you for coming,
Mr. Williams.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.050
Andre can wait in reception
while we...

26:01.050 --> 26:04.050
- you need to hear
what he has to say.

26:04.050 --> 26:06.190
Tell him.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.190
- Keo's been calling me
about the gun.

26:08.190 --> 26:10.960
He got up in my face
at school yesterday.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.160
Told me that he needed
his gun back.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.030
Then he came by the house later,

26:15.030 --> 26:17.030
and started
pounding on the door.

26:17.030 --> 26:19.030
I pretended I wasn't home,

26:19.030 --> 26:20.970
but I'm afraid if I go back
to school tomorrow,

26:20.970 --> 26:23.970
something bad might happen.

26:23.970 --> 26:27.870
- This is all gonna work out.

26:27.880 --> 26:31.010
We're gonna charge keo
with murder.

26:31.010 --> 26:33.010
His visit to your apartment
the other day,

26:33.010 --> 26:34.280
and the blood on
the gun you turned in

26:34.280 --> 26:36.220
are key pieces of evidence.

26:36.220 --> 26:39.520
But we can't proceed
without you.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.260
We'll need you and Andre
to testify in the grand jury.

26:42.260 --> 26:45.160
- Testify against
my sister's boy?

26:45.160 --> 26:48.060
- Your sister's boy killed
an innocent young girl.

26:48.060 --> 26:50.130
What if it was Andre?

26:52.170 --> 26:55.270
- Andre won't have
keo threatening him anymore.

26:59.570 --> 27:01.310
- Aren't you tired of all this?

27:01.310 --> 27:03.240
- Damn right, I am.

27:03.250 --> 27:06.250
- Then help us get justice.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.010
- I've tried to do
the right thing

27:08.020 --> 27:09.920
this whole time.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.920
I turned in the gun
like I was supposed to.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.120
I told you the truth about keo
when you asked me.

27:14.120 --> 27:18.020
I dropped what I was doing,
and came over here tonight.

27:18.030 --> 27:22.230
But if drexel posse finds out
I was anywhere near a courtroom,

27:22.230 --> 27:24.200
or a grand jury,

27:24.200 --> 27:26.200
what do you expect is going
to happen to me and Andre?

27:26.200 --> 27:31.300
What? You think locking keo up
is gonna solve the problem?

27:34.610 --> 27:36.180
- We can offer you both
some protection.

27:36.180 --> 27:38.180
- Protection.
That sounds like a fine idea

27:38.180 --> 27:40.180
sitting up here
in this nice law office.

27:40.180 --> 27:44.620
I'm sure you've got programs,
protocols, whatever.

27:44.620 --> 27:47.020
But it's the law of the street
we talking about now.

27:47.020 --> 27:51.290
These kids still paying back
grudges from five years ago.

27:51.290 --> 27:55.930
- So what are you going to do?

27:55.930 --> 27:59.630
- We'll stay with some friends
in wrigleyville for a few days.

27:59.630 --> 28:03.940
After that, I don't know.

28:05.710 --> 28:08.310
But I've done
all I can do for you now.

28:08.310 --> 28:11.180
I need to keep
me and Andre alive.

28:15.350 --> 28:18.620
- We appreciate your help.

28:25.260 --> 28:28.360
Stay safe.

28:34.670 --> 28:36.400
- So that's it?

28:36.400 --> 28:38.070
Keo Vincent skates,

28:38.070 --> 28:41.170
and the haleys get
a final kick in the gut.

28:55.390 --> 28:59.290
- Cubs won.

28:59.290 --> 29:02.400
- You came up here
to give me a baseball score?

29:05.030 --> 29:07.730
The Lara Haley trial
isn't going well.

29:07.740 --> 29:10.740
- Yeah. To say the least.

29:10.740 --> 29:12.740
- Go home, Peter.

29:12.740 --> 29:14.410
There'll be another
innocent victim next week,

29:14.410 --> 29:16.210
and then another,
and there's nothing

29:16.210 --> 29:18.340
you nor I can do about it.

29:18.350 --> 29:20.180
- You know, if I believed that,

29:20.180 --> 29:23.280
I'd be coaching at some
junior college in Wisconsin.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.760
My grandparents
lived in this small town

29:31.760 --> 29:34.430
in eastern Tennessee.

29:34.430 --> 29:37.200
And I went down there
many years ago to talk to

29:37.200 --> 29:40.300
this lawyer
who was drafting their wills.

29:42.200 --> 29:45.470
The walls of his offices
were lined

29:45.470 --> 29:48.470
with paintings of trees.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.780
- What kind of trees?

29:51.780 --> 29:53.710
- He'd painted
every tree in the county

29:53.720 --> 29:58.180
where a black man was lynched.

29:58.190 --> 30:00.450
Black kids killing black kids.

30:00.460 --> 30:04.090
This is 300 years in the making.

30:04.090 --> 30:08.390
- It doesn't mean we can't try
to make things better.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.260
- Better has to come
from the inside.

30:11.270 --> 30:14.800
Not from politicians like me,
or do-gooders like you.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.500
You know, there are a lot
of people who think

30:17.510 --> 30:19.810
nothing's going to change until
the mothers and fathers

30:19.810 --> 30:23.410
in my community
start behaving like parents.

30:23.410 --> 30:25.410
Enforcing some rules.

30:25.410 --> 30:28.680
Reading books
to their sons and daughters.

30:28.680 --> 30:31.380
- I didn't say that.

30:31.390 --> 30:33.150
- No.

30:33.150 --> 30:34.450
But you think it.

30:34.460 --> 30:37.220
Am I right?

30:39.360 --> 30:40.790
Guilty as charged.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.130
But we both know
it's more complicated.

30:43.130 --> 30:46.400
- You're damn right it is.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.530
Don't beat yourself up.

30:48.540 --> 30:50.840
You are nothing
if not persistent.

30:50.840 --> 30:54.110
What's that supposed to mean?

30:56.510 --> 31:01.510
- You found a way to strong-arm
all those big telecom companies.

31:01.520 --> 31:03.880
And I'm sure you're gonna
find a way to take down

31:03.890 --> 31:08.190
the one little gangbanger
that killed Lara Haley.

31:19.730 --> 31:22.440
- Your client's
out of the hospital?

31:22.440 --> 31:23.870
- He's on crutches,
but he's good to go.

31:23.870 --> 31:26.440
- You've had your 72 hours,
Mr. stone.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.610
Are you ready to proceed?
- Yes and no.

31:28.610 --> 31:30.780
We're moving to dismiss our case
against Ms. schmidt's client.

31:30.780 --> 31:32.610
- Fabulous, we consent...
- But...

31:32.610 --> 31:35.150
We're still pressing forward
with his trial.

31:35.150 --> 31:37.580
- I'm confused.
- You're not the only one.

31:37.590 --> 31:39.320
- We'd like for
Mr. Stackhouse to believe

31:39.320 --> 31:40.750
there's still a case
against him.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.720
Same with the jury,
and anyone outside this room.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.730
- You're asking me to preside
over what's essentially a ruse?

31:45.730 --> 31:48.390
- Well,
I wouldn't use that word.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.860
We'd like the trial
to keep going so I can

31:49.860 --> 31:52.470
call a witness to the stand
named keo Vincent.

31:52.470 --> 31:54.400
He's a gang associate
of Ms. schmidt's client,

31:54.400 --> 31:56.540
and in all probability,
the one who fired the shot

31:56.540 --> 31:58.670
that killed Lara Haley.

31:58.670 --> 32:00.610
- I want the right person
in jail for this crime,

32:00.610 --> 32:02.740
but what you're proposing
is highly unusual.

32:02.740 --> 32:04.510
- But not without precedent.

32:04.510 --> 32:06.350
In certain
extraordinary circumstances,

32:06.350 --> 32:09.620
shadow proceedings
have been conducted in New York.

32:09.620 --> 32:11.880
- And in operation greylord,
right here in cook county.

32:11.890 --> 32:13.890
- Okay,
just so I'm clear on this.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.390
You've mistakenly charged
my client with murder.

32:16.390 --> 32:18.390
As a result,
he was shot and wounded,

32:18.390 --> 32:19.660
and is lucky to be alive.

32:19.660 --> 32:22.800
And now you want
to use him as bait?

32:22.800 --> 32:24.860
- Exactly.
If there was any other option...

32:24.870 --> 32:26.900
- he's a human being,
not a pawn in a chess game.

32:26.900 --> 32:30.200
I won't be a party to this.

32:32.610 --> 32:34.710
- Give me a minute.

32:36.610 --> 32:37.980
Kerry. Kerry!

32:37.980 --> 32:39.780
Please.
- How could you do this to me?

32:39.780 --> 32:41.380
- To you?
- Yes, to me.

32:41.380 --> 32:42.920
This is my first homicide trial,

32:42.920 --> 32:45.550
and you're asking me to do
something that's shady at best.

32:45.550 --> 32:47.690
- We're dismissing the case.
Your client's gonna walk.

32:47.690 --> 32:51.520
- I'm deceiving a client,
participating in a sham trial.

32:51.530 --> 32:52.660
- Okay.

32:52.660 --> 32:54.790
Wait.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.460
We know who killed
Lara Haley now,

32:56.460 --> 32:58.000
and the only way
we're gonna get this guy

32:58.000 --> 33:01.470
is if we all take a little risk.

33:01.470 --> 33:02.740
When I started here,

33:02.740 --> 33:04.640
they had me doing research
in appeals.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.910
Stone was prosecuting
Victor cathridge.

33:06.910 --> 33:08.940
- The guy who murdered
three women on the l.

33:08.940 --> 33:10.940
- One day during the trial,
I walked into the courtroom

33:10.950 --> 33:12.580
to drop off a brief.

33:12.580 --> 33:13.950
Stone was cross-examining
a witness,

33:13.950 --> 33:15.820
and while I was waiting there,

33:15.820 --> 33:18.950
I saw cathridge was
fidgeting with something

33:18.950 --> 33:20.520
under the defense table.

33:20.520 --> 33:21.920
- Oh, no.
- It was suspicious,

33:21.920 --> 33:24.260
and I thought about
alerting one the deputies,

33:24.260 --> 33:26.260
but cathridge
would see it coming.

33:26.260 --> 33:28.730
So I tip-toed into the well,

33:28.730 --> 33:30.900
handed the brief
to Peter's second chair,

33:30.900 --> 33:33.030
and as I was walking out,

33:33.030 --> 33:35.600
I flipped over
the defense table.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.840
Before anyone knew
what was going on,

33:37.840 --> 33:39.710
there were four deputies
on top of cathridge,

33:39.710 --> 33:42.980
one had me in a choke hold
until I could point them

33:42.980 --> 33:46.750
to the razorblade cathridge
had wedged under the table.

33:46.750 --> 33:48.550
If you want the right results,

33:48.550 --> 33:52.290
sometimes you have to do
something unorthodox.

33:53.660 --> 33:56.760
- So what do you say?

33:58.990 --> 34:00.060
<i>- Who is it?</i>

34:00.060 --> 34:01.890
- Peoples gas, ma'am.

34:01.900 --> 34:03.960
Sorry to disturb you,
but I'm checking on a gas leak.

34:03.970 --> 34:06.870
<i>- No gas in here.</i>

34:06.870 --> 34:08.699
- Either you let me in
to check it out,

34:08.699 --> 34:11.800
or I go downstairs to shut off
your gas and electric.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.310
State's attorney, Mrs. Vincent.

34:15.310 --> 34:16.739
- You tricked me.

34:16.739 --> 34:18.080
- What's going on, ma?

34:19.080 --> 34:21.010
I got nothing to say to you.

34:21.020 --> 34:22.820
- We have
a material witness order.

34:22.820 --> 34:25.080
You need to come with us.
- Material witness?

34:25.090 --> 34:27.820
- It means the judge wants him
to come to court to testify.

34:27.820 --> 34:29.659
- Testify about what?
- Don't worry.

34:29.659 --> 34:31.659
I got this.
- You sure?

34:31.659 --> 34:33.489
Give me a call
when you get there.

34:33.489 --> 34:35.830
- No service on my cell, ma.
You ain't paying my bill.

34:35.830 --> 34:38.500
- I did pay your bill.
What you think?

34:38.500 --> 34:39.900
- You two can settle this later.

34:39.900 --> 34:43.340
It should only take
a couple of hours.

34:45.540 --> 34:48.070
- Call your next witness,
Mr. stone.

34:48.080 --> 34:51.380
- The people call keo Vincent.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.760
- Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you're about

35:07.760 --> 35:09.360
to give will be the truth,
the whole truth,

35:09.360 --> 35:10.930
and nothing but the truth
so help you god?

35:10.930 --> 35:12.930
- Do I got a choice?

35:12.930 --> 35:15.000
- I'll take that as a yes.

35:15.940 --> 35:18.000
- Morning, keo.

35:18.970 --> 35:21.870
I'd like to call your attention
to the afternoon of July 11th.

35:21.880 --> 35:24.040
Were you in the englewood
neighborhood that day?

35:24.050 --> 35:25.950
- Could be.
- Specifically at the home

35:25.950 --> 35:28.680
of your cousin,
a boy named Andre Williams?

35:28.680 --> 35:29.820
- Andre said I was there?

35:29.820 --> 35:32.820
- Just answer the question.

35:32.820 --> 35:34.720
- I don't remember.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.620
- But you do remember changing
into some of Andre's clothes

35:36.620 --> 35:38.090
around that time, right?

35:38.090 --> 35:39.830
- What kind of clothes?

35:39.830 --> 35:41.830
- It was a black Polo shirt,
some blue jeans.

35:41.830 --> 35:43.830
He's littler than me.

35:43.830 --> 35:45.700
We don't even wear
the same size.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.570
- But you do remember
being there now?

35:47.570 --> 35:49.000
- Can't say for sure.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
- And speaking with your uncle,
Ernest Williams.

35:51.010 --> 35:52.810
- If I was there and
he was there, then yeah,

35:52.810 --> 35:54.570
I would've talked to him.

35:54.580 --> 35:56.180
- Maybe you remember
that Andre gave you something.

35:56.180 --> 35:58.080
He gave you a...

35:58.080 --> 35:59.910
It was a bag.

35:59.910 --> 36:02.820
Just a small, brown bag
with something heavy in it.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.720
- I gotta answer
all these questions?

36:04.720 --> 36:08.990
- Do your best.

36:08.990 --> 36:14.730
- I don't know nothing
about any brown bag.

36:14.730 --> 36:16.430
- Judge,
I'd like to show the witness

36:16.430 --> 36:18.430
what's being offered as
people's exhibit 1.

36:18.430 --> 36:20.670
- All right.

36:25.040 --> 36:28.670
- You ever seen
that particular gun before?

36:28.680 --> 36:30.810
- No.

36:30.810 --> 36:32.180
- Fair enough.

36:32.180 --> 36:33.910
Can defense counsel
have an opportunity to see

36:33.920 --> 36:35.920
this exhibit?

36:35.920 --> 36:37.720
Actually,

36:37.720 --> 36:40.750
keo, you wanna make sure
that thing's not loaded?

36:42.720 --> 36:44.720
- Chamber's clear.

36:44.730 --> 36:48.860
- And what about the magazine?

36:48.860 --> 36:51.860
- Clip's empty, too.

36:51.870 --> 36:55.970
- Can I see the gun, please?

36:58.240 --> 37:00.770
- Now, the magazine release
on this gun...

37:00.780 --> 37:03.640
It's inoperable.

37:03.640 --> 37:07.050
But you knew that
because this is your gun.

37:07.050 --> 37:09.050
That's why you had to smack
the handle a few times

37:09.050 --> 37:10.480
to get the mag to release.

37:10.490 --> 37:11.780
Just like you did
four months ago

37:11.790 --> 37:13.120
when you loaded this same gun,

37:13.120 --> 37:14.750
jumped on your bike,
and rode to the corner

37:14.760 --> 37:16.160
of 68th street
and marshfield Avenue

37:16.160 --> 37:18.060
where you opened fire on
a group of gang rivals,

37:18.060 --> 37:19.990
killing a ten-year-old girl
in the process.

37:19.990 --> 37:21.730
- Man, you making all this up.

37:21.730 --> 37:23.100
Coming at me about some nonsense

37:23.100 --> 37:24.660
about some button
that don't work.

37:24.670 --> 37:25.930
That means I drill somebody?

37:25.930 --> 37:28.170
You know what?
I'm out of here.

37:28.170 --> 37:29.940
- The people move
to dismiss all charges

37:29.940 --> 37:31.670
against Chris Stackhouse.
- Granted.

37:31.670 --> 37:33.010
- Arrest this man for
the murder of Lara Haley.

37:33.010 --> 37:34.970
- Let me go.
- Hands behind your back!

37:34.980 --> 37:36.740
- Let me go!

37:36.740 --> 37:39.080
Let me go, man!

37:39.080 --> 37:40.810
Let me go, man.
- Stay down.

37:40.820 --> 37:43.220
- I didn't do nothing
to that girl.

37:46.850 --> 37:48.850
- You're sure he's the one
who killed our daughter?

37:48.860 --> 37:50.220
- I am now.

37:50.220 --> 37:51.860
Sometimes you have to make
a wrong turn

37:51.860 --> 37:53.260
before you find your way.

37:53.260 --> 37:55.260
I'm sorry to
put you through this again.

37:55.260 --> 37:57.000
- We'll be there.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.900
- Thank you.

37:58.900 --> 38:02.900
- That boy was barely older
than Lara was.

38:09.140 --> 38:11.940
- Don't tell me.
Another ride home?

38:11.950 --> 38:14.080
- Nope.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.550
You're on your own now.

38:16.550 --> 38:18.850
- Hey, Stackhouse.

38:18.850 --> 38:20.990
- Yeah?

38:20.990 --> 38:23.290
- Crossroads for you.

38:23.290 --> 38:25.020
- What you mean?

38:25.030 --> 38:26.930
- You just beat a murder rap
and a bullet.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.330
Keep doing what you're doing,
sooner or later,

38:28.330 --> 38:30.960
your luck's gonna run out.

38:30.970 --> 38:32.730
Here.

38:32.730 --> 38:34.130
A guy I know runs
a jobs training program

38:34.140 --> 38:36.000
in Hyde park.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.140
Use my name.
He'll hook you up.

38:39.140 --> 38:41.240
- Maybe.

38:47.350 --> 38:49.110
- Now was that so terrible?

38:49.120 --> 38:51.580
- I hate to admit it,
but I did enjoy the show.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.320
- And you get to walk back
to your office and tell them

38:53.320 --> 38:54.950
you won
your first homicide trial.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.590
- Hm.
Not sure what I'll tell my boss

38:56.590 --> 38:58.290
when he asks me how, but...

38:58.290 --> 39:00.130
- the prosecutors
stunk up the courtroom?

39:00.130 --> 39:01.860
- Not bad.

39:01.860 --> 39:03.620
At least I can say that
with a straight face.

39:04.370 --> 39:07.830
See you in court, counsel.

39:09.370 --> 39:10.940
<i>- I'm getting calls.</i>

39:10.940 --> 39:12.910
Detroit, Baltimore.

39:12.910 --> 39:15.040
They want to know
if this thing actually works.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.780
- Well, the two gangs in
englewood have been quiet

39:16.780 --> 39:18.310
for a couple of days now.

39:18.310 --> 39:20.850
- You can't kick millenials
off social media forever.

39:20.850 --> 39:22.850
It's like air and water to us.

39:22.850 --> 39:25.250
They'll find out how
to get back on soon enough.

39:25.250 --> 39:28.190
- Still, not a bad week.

39:28.190 --> 39:30.160
- All it took was a phony trial,

39:30.160 --> 39:33.930
tricking a 15-year-old
into incriminating himself,

39:33.930 --> 39:36.200
and goosing
the due process clause

39:36.200 --> 39:37.960
<i>and</i> the first amendment.

39:37.970 --> 39:39.300
- All with judicial approval.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.270
And a last minute save.

40:06.330 --> 40:08.330
- Oh, no.
