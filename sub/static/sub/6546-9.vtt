00:01.460 --> 00:02.870
Announcer: Previously on "Haven"...

00:02.962 --> 00:04.577
- Why am I here, Duke?

00:04.672 --> 00:07.084
When you used
that Trouble on me,

00:07.175 --> 00:09.962
why didn't you just
put Audrey back in control?

00:10.052 --> 00:11.212
- It was an accident.

00:11.304 --> 00:13.636
- You split us because
you wanted Audrey,

00:13.723 --> 00:17.466
but, subconsciously,
you wanted me around, too.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.391
- Have you heard
of the Troubles, Mr. Brody?

00:19.478 --> 00:21.434
Were you aware that
if your father died,

00:21.522 --> 00:23.058
you would inherit
his popularity?

00:23.149 --> 00:24.639
- 0h, Chris,
we love you.

00:24.734 --> 00:27.316
- That is a nasty infection
on your leg.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.064
So we're gonna take
a small biopsy

00:29.155 --> 00:30.565
and send it off
for analysis.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.908
- We need to steal
that biopsy.

00:32.992 --> 00:34.152
If we just walk away,

00:34.243 --> 00:36.359
the secrets we worked
our whole life to protect

00:36.454 --> 00:38.115
will be revealed.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.197
- Better take this
for evidence.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.328
Here's to Haven. Its secret's safe for another day.

00:43.419 --> 00:45.455
- The CDC.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.831
Oh, no.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.163
- Vince Teagues?

00:48.257 --> 00:50.498
Dr. Charlotte Cross,
Centers for Disease Control.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.003
I'm looking
for your brother, Dave.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.174
- Is everything okay?

00:53.262 --> 00:55.639
- That's what I'm hoping
to find out.

00:58.643 --> 01:00.679
- (echoing growl)

01:17.578 --> 01:21.992
- (screaming)

01:23.084 --> 01:24.620
- (echoing growl)

01:25.962 --> 01:27.543
(crackling)

01:40.017 --> 01:42.224
- (echoey grunt)

01:48.484 --> 01:50.645
- (labored breathing)

02:05.501 --> 02:08.914
(phone beeping)

02:09.005 --> 02:10.711
(phone line ringing)

02:10.798 --> 02:12.413
Chris.

02:12.508 --> 02:15.045
Ahem.
Dave Teagues here.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.592
Listen...

02:16.679 --> 02:19.921
I could really use your help with something.

02:20.016 --> 02:22.132
J‘J‘

02:22.226 --> 02:24.433
- So you're all Audrey?
- Yep.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.806
- And Mara is...

02:26.897 --> 02:28.603
all Mara.

02:28.691 --> 02:30.431
She's locked up
in the hold of Duke's boat.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.983
- That's music to my ears.
She give us anything?

02:33.070 --> 02:34.810
- She helped us
with the Trouble last week.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.861
She knew how it worked
since she created it

02:36.949 --> 02:38.610
in the first place.
- Nothing since?

02:38.701 --> 02:40.111
- We haven't had
a Trouble.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.818
It's been quiet
while you were gone.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.449
- Nathan finally went
and bought some new socks.

02:44.540 --> 02:45.871
- Uh-huh, yeah.

02:47.293 --> 02:48.624
- (chuckles)

02:50.296 --> 02:53.254
- Listen, I am going to go
get some refills, all right?

02:53.341 --> 02:55.002
- Mm-hmm.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.208
- Another hour and we can
spike them.

03:00.264 --> 03:01.925
- I should leave town
more often.

03:03.976 --> 03:06.467
- I'm sorry about
your sister.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.894
- Yeah.

03:08.981 --> 03:13.566
Crazy guy came in the ER,
guns blazing, and, uh,

03:13.652 --> 03:15.563
her Trouble kicked in.

03:17.907 --> 03:21.399
- To your sister.
- And more quiet days in Haven.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.326
- Excuse me.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.448
Chief Hendrickson?

03:27.458 --> 03:30.325
Dr. Charlotte cross with
the Centers for Disease Control.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.159
They told me I'd find
you here.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.585
Can I have a moment alone?

03:42.765 --> 03:44.676
I've come to officially
request police help

03:44.767 --> 03:47.600
in locating a man
named David Teagues.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.017
Do you know him?

03:49.105 --> 03:50.720
- Can I ask why you need
to see Dave?

03:50.815 --> 03:53.431
- A biopsy from his leg
crossed my microscope.

03:53.526 --> 03:56.188
What I saw was virulent
and new to science.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.688
It warrants follow up.

03:57.780 --> 03:59.190
- If Dave were sick,
I'd have heard about it.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.407
We're a small town.

04:00.491 --> 04:03.028
- If he's not sick,
it won't be a problem.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.734
Won't know until
I examine him.

04:04.829 --> 04:06.911
- Okay, well,
join me back at the station.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.862
I'll find Dave for you.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.949
- Thank you,
Chief Hendrickson.

04:12.044 --> 04:15.252
- Please,
call me Dwight.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.960
- Scientists looking
around Haven?

04:18.050 --> 04:19.506
That's our worst nightmare.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.754
We got so focused on
thinnies and aether,

04:21.846 --> 04:23.211
we forget about the threat
of the real world

04:23.305 --> 04:25.921
finding out
about the Troubles.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.051
- Duke's on.

04:27.143 --> 04:28.929
(phone beeps)
- Hey, Duke.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.271
-If this government doc
ﬁnds out about the Troubles,

04:31.355 --> 04:33.767
we're all gonna end up
in cages like lab rats.

04:33.858 --> 04:35.723
- We want to make sure
Mara's locked up tight.

04:35.818 --> 04:37.024
You need
reinforcements?

04:37.111 --> 04:38.726
-Look, Mara ’s not
going anywhere.

04:38.821 --> 04:40.436
But you better get
this CDC lady out of Haven

04:40.531 --> 04:42.067
before she gets a whiff
of the Troubles.

04:42.158 --> 04:44.069
- Agreed.
I put her in my office

04:44.160 --> 04:46.071
so she wouldn't
wander around.

04:46.162 --> 04:47.868
(indistinct chatter)

04:47.955 --> 04:48.944
(phone vibrates)

04:49.039 --> 04:51.075
- Look, Gloria's
with Pete Palak.

04:51.167 --> 04:52.156
I asked him to call in.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.411
- Who's Pete Palak?

04:53.502 --> 04:55.083
- Haven's epidemiologist.

04:55.171 --> 04:56.160
Maine Department of Health

04:56.255 --> 04:57.244
wants to know
how people die,

04:57.339 --> 04:59.250
and Pete cooks up
official statistics

04:59.341 --> 05:00.501
to hide the Troubles.

05:00.593 --> 05:02.584
Good guy to stonewall
the CDC.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.009
- How come
I've never met him?

05:04.096 --> 05:05.085
(phone ringing)
- He likes numbers

05:05.181 --> 05:07.263
more than people.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.180
(beep)
- Gloria? Pete?

05:09.268 --> 05:11.475
- Hi there.
- She already came to see me,

05:11.562 --> 05:12.677
Dr. Cross
from the CDC.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.352
Have I seen any early signs
of an outbreak

05:14.440 --> 05:15.771
from Dave Teagues' leg?

05:15.858 --> 05:18.270
I haven't, but then she starts
digging into my data,

05:18.360 --> 05:20.100
questioning me
about the barbecue accidents,

05:20.196 --> 05:22.938
the gas leaks, all of my
cover stories for the Troubles!

05:23.032 --> 05:24.192
- Yeah, okay,
calm down, Pete.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.773
Have a drink
of water, okay?

05:25.868 --> 05:26.983
- Did she find anything?

05:27.077 --> 05:28.203
-Well, no, Imean,

05:28.287 --> 05:29.777
Pete's been doing this
a long time.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.157
You know how smart he is--

05:31.248 --> 05:33.660
that's formaldehyde,
use the tap--

05:33.751 --> 05:35.412
about medical statistics.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.334
Look, the folks in Haven

05:37.421 --> 05:39.082
have been working
for centuries

05:39.173 --> 05:40.288
to hide their Troubles.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.792
We can ’t blow it now.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.466
Just give her what she wants
and get her out of here.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.760
Okay, you know, I got to go
before Pete hurts himself.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.508
(beep)

05:48.599 --> 05:50.009
- Vince said Dave got
that wound in his leg

05:50.100 --> 05:51.681
when he fell in that hole
in the cave.

05:51.769 --> 05:53.134
- Revealing
an inter-dimensional

05:53.229 --> 05:55.140
injury to the CDC?

05:55.231 --> 05:56.641
Yeah, not a great idea.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.438
- All right,
then what should we do?

05:58.526 --> 06:00.812
-All units, we got
a 507 on Wharf Road.

06:00.903 --> 06:04.566
Caller said it’s "disturbing, "
no further details.

06:04.657 --> 06:06.272
- Show me and Parker
responding.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.821
Disturbing
public nuisance?

06:09.912 --> 06:11.322
Could be nothing.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.573
Could be a Trouble.

06:12.665 --> 06:15.828
- Any Trouble is
a bad Trouble today.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.211
- So what about Dave?

06:21.298 --> 06:22.834
-As far as Dave,
I may have a plan.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.792
Buddy of mine sails
for Caracas tonight.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.217
Figured if Dave's
in Venezuela--

06:27.304 --> 06:29.135
- Dr. Cross has no reason
to stay in Haven.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.929
I like it.
You work the boat.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.552
I'll find Dave.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.758
(hangs up phone)

06:33.852 --> 06:36.889
- So, the Frenchman says,
"Papillon. "

06:36.981 --> 06:38.767
And then they all look
at the German,

06:38.857 --> 06:40.142
and the German says,

06:40.234 --> 06:42.020
(German accent) "What is wrong
with Schmetterling?"

06:42.111 --> 06:44.443
- (laughing)
Dude, that's hilarious.

06:45.614 --> 06:46.990
- Dave,
we got to move now.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.905
- Why?
What's up?

06:49.952 --> 06:51.567
- David Teagues?
- Yes?

06:51.662 --> 06:52.651
- I'm with the CDC.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.078
I need to speak
with you in private.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.826
Thanks for finding him
so fast.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.623
- Sure thing.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.164
J‘J‘

07:34.913 --> 07:37.165
- So...
hoW'd you get this?

07:37.249 --> 07:38.238
- Musselling.

07:38.334 --> 07:40.416
Yeah. Jellyfish stung me.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.333
- Jellyfish.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.161
(laughing)
- Boy, did it hurt.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.541
Had an expert check it out

07:45.633 --> 07:46.839
last time he was in Haven

07:46.925 --> 07:49.132
and he told me
it wouldn't kill me.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.345
- An expert in what?

07:50.429 --> 07:51.714
- Jellies.

07:51.805 --> 07:55.343
Our town has a world-class
marine biologist.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.769
- You showed it to Chris Brody.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.721
Mm, smart.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.148
- Say, Chief, last time
we had a shark sighting,

08:05.235 --> 08:07.487
you Skyped Dr. Brody.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.857
Maybe you could get
in touch with him

08:09.948 --> 08:11.688
for Dr. Cross
to talk to.

08:11.784 --> 08:13.445
- That won't be necessary.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.662
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

08:15.746 --> 08:20.206
- So, how long have you
been an epidemiologist?

08:20.292 --> 08:22.624
- Feels like my whole life.

08:22.711 --> 08:23.826
(beep)

08:23.921 --> 08:26.162
-Hey, Chief.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.632
- Chris.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.172
-You got another shark?

08:29.259 --> 08:31.796
- So good to see you, man.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.003
- Hey, Chris.
- Yeah, but-- but listen,

08:34.098 --> 08:35.963
we have a person
from the CDC here

08:36.058 --> 08:38.174
who wants to ask you
about the jellyfish wound

08:38.268 --> 08:39.724
on Dave's leg.

08:42.564 --> 08:47.558
- Dr. Cross,
epidemiology section, and...

08:47.653 --> 08:50.645
in general, a big fan of...

08:50.739 --> 08:52.900
blue eyes like yours.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.482
-Yeah, I've seen
six other cases like Dave '3.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.159
It’s a toxin from
a rare cyanea species.

08:58.247 --> 08:59.532
No long-term morbidity.

08:59.623 --> 09:00.738
Just the wound,

09:00.833 --> 09:02.994
which is not unlike
rhus dermatitis.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.825
- Rhus dermatitis?

09:04.920 --> 09:07.411
I think I have
just the thing.

09:08.757 --> 09:11.464
Um, l-- I'll--
Just follow me.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.590
(chair squeaks on floor)

09:19.977 --> 09:21.057
- HoW'd you do that?

09:21.145 --> 09:23.056
-Ah, Dave gave me
the heads up,

09:23.147 --> 09:25.684
so I read her CV
and her scientiﬁc papers.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.935
I found one relative weakness
in her knowledge.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.891
Invertebrates.
- Smart.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.352
Aim a lie at ignorance.

09:31.447 --> 09:33.312
-Yeah, smart to have
a charm Trouble when you lie.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.489
But listen, this lady
is not ignorant

09:35.576 --> 09:36.941
about much else.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.117
She's brilliant
and she won ’t miss a beat.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.536
You got to get her out of
Haven stat, do you hear me?

09:41.623 --> 09:43.079
- Totally, totally.

09:43.167 --> 09:45.533
So-- so, Chris, when are you
coming back to Haven, man?

09:45.627 --> 09:47.037
-I’m hanging up now.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.994
-No, but wait,
I got a brand new crossbow!

09:52.301 --> 09:54.383
Charm Trouble.
Gets me every time.

09:54.470 --> 09:56.131
- I gave Mr. Teagues
a sample

09:56.221 --> 09:58.052
of medication
for him to try.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.255
I tried calling in
a full script,

10:02.311 --> 10:04.267
acute staph infection.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.969
- Uh, there's a pharmacy
two towns over.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.770
I can--l can drive
you there.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.894
- No, that won't
be necessary.

10:09.985 --> 10:12.397
I'll give Dave
a call tomorrow.

10:12.488 --> 10:13.978
See if the medication's
even working.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.448
- You're staying?

10:15.532 --> 10:17.147
I, uh, I thought
you'd have to go fight

10:17.242 --> 10:20.234
some deadly diseases
in the far corners of the world.

10:20.329 --> 10:21.569
- Yeah, that's the thing.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.325
You spend your life
trying to prevent disaster,

10:24.416 --> 10:27.078
it's hard to give yourself
a break.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.581
So, I'm self-prescribing
a day of rest.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.083
Got myself a little B&B
for the night.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.415
First stop, lobster.

10:34.510 --> 10:37.172
-Hmm.
I knowjust the place.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.753
If you don't mind
some company.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.349
- Sure.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.510
(cheerful carnival music)

10:46.605 --> 10:48.596
- So you hate
my new socks?

10:50.984 --> 10:52.565
- No, I like them.
I'm just saying

10:52.653 --> 10:54.268
they don't make good
duty socks.

10:54.363 --> 10:57.196
- Uh-huh. Well, perps will
see me coming a mile away.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.113
- (laughing) Yeah.
Haven PD.

11:01.036 --> 11:04.278
Woman: Morning, sir.
Morning.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.785
- Uh, we're gonna
need you to move on.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.287
J‘J‘

11:09.378 --> 11:11.209
Woman: Hello. Hi.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.706
- Sir.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.710
- M
al
am?

11:16.802 --> 11:18.793
Woman: Maybe he wants us
to dance with him.

11:28.230 --> 11:32.018
- Empty.
Okay, that's weird.

11:35.404 --> 11:36.735
Uh...
Woman: Come here.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.358
- Nothing to worry
about, folks.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.365
(hushed chatter)

11:42.452 --> 11:43.703
- Let's go.

11:43.787 --> 11:44.822
Woman: Come on, guys.
Let's go.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.323
(indistinct chatter)

11:46.415 --> 11:47.825
- Oh, God.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.531
- Let's get out of here.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.134
J‘J‘

11:58.218 --> 12:00.129
(woman screaming)

12:02.014 --> 12:03.629
(all screaming)

12:06.268 --> 12:07.974
J‘J‘

12:08.061 --> 12:10.347
- You all right?
- Th-That's beyond scary.

12:10.439 --> 12:13.272
That's definitely a Trouble.
But I'm-- I'm fine.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.391
Woman: ljust wanna go home.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.906
Woman 2: Look,
there's another one.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.025
- Another one?

12:21.116 --> 12:22.356
- There's no way
to explain this away

12:22.451 --> 12:24.237
if the CDC lady
seesit

12:24.328 --> 12:26.239
We've got to get
these things out of here.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.787
- Oh, how many are there?

12:34.546 --> 12:38.038
You handle Smokey.
I'll take Yogi.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.375
Oh, no.
You--

12:41.470 --> 12:43.210
- The miniaturization,

12:43.305 --> 12:44.920
especially of
genetics equipment,

12:45.015 --> 12:46.130
is amazing.
- It's like you have a full lab.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.931
- Which is good,
because I often find myself

12:49.019 --> 12:51.385
in a hot zone for a few days
before tanks roll in.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.890
- Tanks roll in?

12:52.981 --> 12:55.097
- It's just our term
for backup.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.352
You know,
we're geek scientists.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.399
But with one phone call,

12:58.487 --> 13:00.899
we can summon choppers,
convoys, troops.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.320
It's really cool.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.240
- Hey, folks,
nothing to see here.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.067
Just a street performer
without a permit,

13:07.162 --> 13:08.777
so we'll be removing him.

13:08.872 --> 13:11.659
- So, aside from lobster,
what else is Haven known for?

13:11.750 --> 13:13.331
- Personally,
I prefer cod jigging.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.624
- Cod jigging?
What's that?

13:14.711 --> 13:16.667
- Hey, Chief.

13:18.382 --> 13:19.667
- Nathan.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.549
- (sighs)
They're out of lobster,

13:22.636 --> 13:27.346
so, you might want
to try The Gull... yeah.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.556
- Yeah, all right.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.760
- You sent a man ahead
to check for you?

13:32.854 --> 13:34.139
- I got to keep
my officers busy.

13:34.231 --> 13:35.266
Haven's a quiet town.

13:35.357 --> 13:36.813
(indistinct chatter)

13:36.900 --> 13:37.980
(woman screaming)
-Oh, my God.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.979
Look, there's another one.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.311
- What was that?
- Uh, it's... locals.

13:42.406 --> 13:44.362
They get upset when places
run out of lobster.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.615
-Just"

13:48.954 --> 13:50.194
(seagulls calling)

13:50.288 --> 13:53.075
(water splashing)

13:57.462 --> 13:59.248
- You done?

14:12.436 --> 14:15.428
- Most people are squirrely
about sex and flesh,

14:15.522 --> 14:19.310
so I guess this means that you and I are moving
toward--

14:19.401 --> 14:21.733
- We're not moving
towards anything.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.685
- But why, Duke?

14:24.906 --> 14:26.316
(keys jingling)

14:26.408 --> 14:31.243
You shared about your mom
and we drank bourbon together.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.496
- You killed Jennifer.

14:35.584 --> 14:36.915
(keys jangling)

14:41.423 --> 14:43.459
- No.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.586
(scoffs)

14:45.677 --> 14:47.178
I didn't, Duke.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.429
I don't know
what killed her.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.427
But it had something
to do with the door,

14:53.518 --> 14:56.430
and the thinnies
that were being sealed.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.683
I wanted her alive.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.606
I could have used her.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.025
- Why do you care
what I think?

15:04.112 --> 15:07.570
- I like this path
that we're on,

15:07.657 --> 15:10.569
even if you don't
see it.

15:10.660 --> 15:15.700
So if you're going
to continue to hate me,

15:15.791 --> 15:18.908
I just want it to be
for the right reasons.

15:19.002 --> 15:22.119
- Well there are
just so many to choose from.

15:22.214 --> 15:23.750
But I think...

15:23.840 --> 15:26.547
(handcuffs clinking)

15:26.635 --> 15:28.751
...that my current favorite

15:28.845 --> 15:30.221
is that because of you...

15:30.305 --> 15:31.340
(snap)

15:31.431 --> 15:34.093
...everybody I care about

15:34.184 --> 15:36.140
is about to get turned
into a lab rat.

15:37.813 --> 15:38.928
- What's going on?

15:45.403 --> 15:46.654
- Get dressed.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.236
(laughter and chatter)

15:52.327 --> 15:53.407
- So where'd you find him?

15:53.495 --> 15:55.736
- Hiding in
an acacia tree.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.914
Fevered and covered
in pustulating sores.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.412
Oh! (chuckles)
I'm sorry.

16:01.503 --> 16:04.540
He looked like something
out of a George Romero movie.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.088
But it wasn't a virus.
It was ants.

16:07.175 --> 16:10.087
This poor Cameroonian farmer
covered himself in sugar

16:10.178 --> 16:13.090
and sat on an anthill.

16:13.181 --> 16:16.389
- On purpose?
Why?

16:16.476 --> 16:17.886
- For love.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.309
To get out of
an arranged marriage,

16:19.396 --> 16:21.136
and save himself
for his sweetie.

16:21.231 --> 16:24.143
Painful move,
but it worked.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.724
He recovered fully.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.105
(indistinct chatter)

16:28.196 --> 16:29.276
It's nice
not having to worry

16:29.364 --> 16:32.401
about mortality
for a moment.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.481
- I admire someone
who shoulders

16:33.577 --> 16:35.442
your kind of
responsibility, Dr. Cross.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.277
- Charlotte.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.452
And you do the same.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.405
- Who, me? No.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.741
Like I said,
quiet little town.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.701
- You're former military.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.582
Not a SEAL,
'cause you're not a jerk.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.460
But... elite training.

16:49.551 --> 16:54.045
I'm thinking...
jarhead, Army Special Forces.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.255
- Rangers,
second battalion.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.216
- Rangers lead the way.

17:00.812 --> 17:01.927
(glasses clinking)

17:02.022 --> 17:05.139
l was Navy.
Flight surgeon.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.939
Your small-town
cop thing

17:07.027 --> 17:08.983
just wasn't adding up
for me.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.652
I can tell when people
have seen the hard stuff.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.482
And you've seen
the hard stuff.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.908
(man coughing)

17:20.415 --> 17:21.746
(coughing continues)

17:21.833 --> 17:23.039
Man: Somebody help this man!

17:23.126 --> 17:24.491
Woman: Is there
a doctor anywhere?

17:24.586 --> 17:25.666
- Sir?

17:27.589 --> 17:29.375
We need to get him
to a hospital.

17:29.466 --> 17:30.501
I'm coming with him.

17:30.592 --> 17:31.832
- Haven has good doctors.

17:31.927 --> 17:33.838
- You see these blisters
on his lips?

17:33.929 --> 17:35.965
They can be caused
by a rare strain of staph

17:36.056 --> 17:37.762
your docs probably
haven't seen.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.510
l have,
and it can be deadly.

17:39.601 --> 17:43.264
If it's the same staph
your pharmacist has...

17:43.355 --> 17:46.017
Haven has an outbreak.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.233
It's lucky I'm here.

17:47.317 --> 17:50.275
- Yeah.
Good thing.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.024
- We now have
three patients

17:58.119 --> 17:59.780
with blistered lips
and fevers.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.407
Good news is
they're stable.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.159
Bad news is Dr. Cross
is sticking around

18:03.250 --> 18:05.411
to figure out
what they have.

18:05.502 --> 18:06.992
- Any chance that
they're Trouble-related?

18:07.087 --> 18:08.668
- I don't know.
But if it is,

18:08.755 --> 18:09.744
Pete will get her
out of town

18:09.839 --> 18:11.045
before she figures
it out.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.121
- How's it coming
with those bears?

18:12.217 --> 18:13.957
- Another one appeared
at the ER.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.212
Nearly caused
a panic that

18:15.303 --> 18:17.134
the CDC doc
couldn't have missed.

18:17.222 --> 18:18.211
They're popping up
around town

18:18.306 --> 18:19.341
quicker than
we can collect them.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.763
- Any idea whose
Trouble this is?

18:20.850 --> 18:22.226
- Maybe.
I'm on my way right now

18:22.310 --> 18:23.766
to talk to a woman
who works at the restaurant

18:23.853 --> 18:25.309
where they
first appeared.

18:25.397 --> 18:26.887
- Just Haven's luck
to have an outbreak

18:26.982 --> 18:28.563
when the CDC's around.

18:28.650 --> 18:29.730
- Yeah.

18:29.818 --> 18:33.902
(indistinct PA announcements)

18:33.989 --> 18:36.480
- It's too bad that we can't use
Charlotte's expertise.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.155
I mean we've got
an accomplished doctor in town.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.653
People are
actually sick,

18:39.744 --> 18:42.736
and we're ginning up
fake diagnoses.

18:42.831 --> 18:45.243
- We ruled out hepatitis,
thankfully.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.743
Dr. Palak thinks they
might have food poisoning

18:46.835 --> 18:48.826
from The Grey Gull.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.581
I'd like to get
some samples.

18:50.672 --> 18:51.707
- I'll come with you.

18:57.012 --> 18:59.754
J‘J‘

18:59.848 --> 19:01.679
(door opens and creaks)

19:03.184 --> 19:05.846
- Oatmeal and toast?

19:05.937 --> 19:07.552
l was hoping that
you'd bring me the head

19:07.647 --> 19:10.263
of whatever public official
is about to discover

19:10.358 --> 19:12.189
the Troubles.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.443
Lab rats.

19:15.530 --> 19:16.736
Wasn't that hard
to figure out.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.609
I've been doing this
a long time.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.906
- So what?
Something like this

19:19.993 --> 19:20.982
has happened before?

19:21.077 --> 19:22.192
- It has.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.699
Back when communication
and transportation

19:24.789 --> 19:26.620
moved as fast
as a horse.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.040
We could stall until
I could get into the barn

19:29.127 --> 19:31.118
and the Troubles
would disappear.

19:31.212 --> 19:34.454
But now, with cell phones
and airplanes...

19:34.549 --> 19:36.756
- Yeah, well...

19:36.843 --> 19:40.051
this CDC lady could have us all
in gerbil cages by sunset.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.753
- CDC, huh?

19:43.058 --> 19:44.889
Oh, well, it doesn't matter
who sounds the alarm.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.477
Every agency
you've heard of,

19:46.561 --> 19:49.303
and some of them
you haven't, will be here.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.480
And guess who the prime
specimens will be?

19:52.567 --> 19:54.808
You and me.

19:54.903 --> 19:58.566
- I think all
Troubled people.

19:58.656 --> 20:01.784
- Dwight, Nathan,
and their ilk?

20:01.868 --> 20:05.235
No, no.
Minor curiosities.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.195
Take a number,
move along.

20:07.290 --> 20:10.578
But the woman who created
the Troubles,

20:10.668 --> 20:13.045
and the man who can
take them away?

20:14.964 --> 20:16.670
We'll be in a cage
under a spotlight

20:16.758 --> 20:18.168
wearing ass-less
hospital gowns

20:18.259 --> 20:21.501
the rest of our lives.

20:21.596 --> 20:24.053
- We're not gonna
let that happen.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.677
- We?

20:26.768 --> 20:30.431
Oh, oh, right.
Your friends.

20:30.522 --> 20:32.103
They don't want
your help, Duke.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.681
You're part of the problem,
not the solution.

20:34.776 --> 20:37.688
- (scoffs)

20:37.779 --> 20:39.064
You're wrong.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.538
- They're going to
order you back here.

20:50.625 --> 20:55.585
They'll want the two weirdoes
locked up and out of sight.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.412
You may not think that
we're birds of a feather,

20:57.507 --> 20:58.997
but they do.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.711
(waves lapping)

21:04.806 --> 21:07.047
- You're certainly
dedicated.

21:07.142 --> 21:08.723
- You ever resect
an infarcted colon

21:08.810 --> 21:11.893
on a 300-pound
petty officer?

21:11.980 --> 21:13.345
This is a walk
in the roses.

21:16.651 --> 21:19.438
- Hi.
How you doing?

21:19.529 --> 21:21.190
What are you doing?

21:21.281 --> 21:23.317
- We're thinking
it's food poisoning.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.649
- You the owner?
- No.

21:28.163 --> 21:29.243
- Listen,
it's a cover story.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.490
If she thinks that's why
people are sick

21:30.582 --> 21:31.617
then she'll leave town.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.289
- Oh, great.

21:33.376 --> 21:34.491
I'm not happy
about this.

21:34.586 --> 21:35.917
- Okay,
but in the meantime,

21:36.004 --> 21:37.744
just stay
out of sight.

21:37.839 --> 21:40.797
I want her to believe
that Haven's a normal place.

21:40.884 --> 21:42.920
- Be-Because you're
more normal than I am?

21:43.011 --> 21:44.376
- By a lot.
But don't get upset,

21:44.471 --> 21:46.132
you might sprout a Trouble
in front of her.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.507
Okay, just go.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.434
(circus music)

21:57.525 --> 21:59.766
- The bears are
Eve's Trouble.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.192
J‘J‘

22:01.279 --> 22:03.361
She's known about them
a long time.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.861
- I'm so glad you're here.
(sniffles)

22:10.955 --> 22:12.991
- Have we met?
- No.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.538
But the last time
my Trouble came out,

22:14.626 --> 22:15.957
your mom
really helped me.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.250
(sniffles)

22:19.380 --> 22:20.665
- My mom?

22:24.093 --> 22:25.833
- That's me
when I was ten.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.379
- Lucy.

22:30.725 --> 22:33.387
- 28 years ago,
Lucy made the bears go away.

22:33.478 --> 22:34.843
- Yeah.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.308
- Wanna help me
get this thing out of here?

22:43.238 --> 22:45.194
(faint traffic noise)

22:45.281 --> 22:46.737
(indistinct PA announcement)

22:46.824 --> 22:48.155
- The patient's recovered?

22:48.243 --> 22:49.824
- Yup.
So we sent them home.

22:49.911 --> 22:52.152
- Why? If this turns out
to be contagious--

22:52.247 --> 22:53.236
- Well,
it's food poisoning.

22:53.331 --> 22:55.868
We eat a lot of
crustaceans around here.

22:55.959 --> 22:57.039
- A word, Chief?

22:57.126 --> 22:59.663
- (clears throat loudly)

22:59.754 --> 23:01.255
- She hiding something?

23:01.339 --> 23:03.796
Giving me the runaround
for some reason?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.498
- I don't think so.
Why?

23:05.593 --> 23:06.673
- Then she's incompetent.

23:06.761 --> 23:08.171
Discharging patients

23:08.263 --> 23:10.675
before a confirmed diagnosis
is stupid.

23:10.765 --> 23:12.471
I just hope it doesn't
cost lives.

23:21.943 --> 23:23.524
- She called you incompetent.
- I don't care.

23:23.611 --> 23:24.896
I just want her
to move along

23:24.988 --> 23:26.524
because there's
a fourth patient.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.696
One that CDC lady
can't know about.

23:28.783 --> 23:30.694
James Banks, room 402.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.286
I need you to go see him
on the QT.

23:32.370 --> 23:34.406
- He's Troubled.
- Yeah, I saw the tattoo.

23:34.497 --> 23:36.362
He's a germophobe,
and he's freaking out

23:36.457 --> 23:37.708
about being
in the hospital,

23:37.792 --> 23:39.578
and I think his Trouble
might activate.

23:39.669 --> 23:40.909
- Yeah.

23:42.672 --> 23:45.379
- The sheets are crawling
with germs!

23:45.466 --> 23:47.331
- Calm down.
- Don't touch me.

23:47.427 --> 23:48.712
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

23:48.803 --> 23:49.963
(shrieking) Don't touch me!

23:51.222 --> 23:52.428
(grunting)

23:52.515 --> 23:53.971
Don't touch me!

23:54.058 --> 23:56.720
- Whoa.
What's up with that?

23:56.811 --> 23:59.723
- My curse.
I make bubbles.

23:59.814 --> 24:00.803
- Bubbles?

24:00.898 --> 24:02.354
(water bubbling)

24:04.068 --> 24:05.057
- His Trouble's started.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.734
We gotta keep
Dr. Cross away.

24:06.821 --> 24:08.732
- First thing we have to do
is get that IV out of his arm.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.939
- If an air bubble hits
his brain--

24:11.034 --> 24:14.276
- (screaming and groaning)

24:14.370 --> 24:17.328
(monitor beeping rapidly)

24:17.415 --> 24:19.827
(monitor flatlines)

24:26.841 --> 24:29.127
- There's a fourth patient.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.594
(monitor continues to flatline)

24:30.678 --> 24:32.339
And he's dead.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.431
- So one patient died,
three recovered.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.432
Our next move
depends on the post-mortem.

24:42.523 --> 24:44.354
I'll join Dr. Verrano
for the autopsy,

24:44.442 --> 24:46.603
which we'll do
under BSL-3 containment.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.104
I'm not taking
any more chances.

24:48.196 --> 24:49.777
And I'm putting Haven
under quarantine

24:49.864 --> 24:52.355
if I find out Mr. Banks
died of that illness.

24:54.577 --> 24:56.738
(shoes clacking on floor)

25:01.209 --> 25:03.996
- Bear costume
was my dad's.

25:04.087 --> 25:06.203
He used to dress up
in it every year

25:06.297 --> 25:10.631
for my birthday
and do a really silly dance.

25:10.718 --> 25:14.176
He used to make
me laugh so hard.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.389
(sniffles)

25:15.473 --> 25:17.259
Then my dad was killed
in a boating accident,

25:17.350 --> 25:18.635
and my Trouble
kicked in.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.557
- So it's your dead father
that keeps appearing

25:20.645 --> 25:23.352
and disappearing
in the bear costume.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.724
- That's my Trouble.

25:24.816 --> 25:27.148
It lets me know
he's dead and gone.

25:27.235 --> 25:29.476
- That's cruel.

25:29.570 --> 25:32.698
I'm sorry.
We have to stop this.

25:32.782 --> 25:35.489
Is there any logic
to where the bears appear?

25:35.576 --> 25:37.703
- Just anywhere I went
with my dad.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.493
- (sighs)

25:39.580 --> 25:42.413
There's this
government scientist

25:42.500 --> 25:45.333
who's in town right now--
- Oh, my horror show costumes

25:45.420 --> 25:47.081
would tip her off
to the Troubles.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.547
My dad
took me everywhere.

25:48.631 --> 25:50.132
The bears
are all over Haven.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.377
She could spot one
on every corner.

25:52.468 --> 25:57.337
And if my Trouble's exposed,
everyone else is?

25:57.432 --> 26:00.424
Hank's Trouble.

26:00.518 --> 26:02.383
(sobbing)
Oh, God, it'd be awful.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.514
- Hank's Troubled?

26:06.065 --> 26:07.441
- (sniffles)

26:10.778 --> 26:12.279
- We need to figure
this out.

26:12.363 --> 26:14.194
I don't think that
the bears have come back

26:14.282 --> 26:15.567
because of your dad.

26:15.658 --> 26:18.365
Have you lost
anyone else recently?

26:18.453 --> 26:20.535
- Oh, no.

26:20.621 --> 26:21.872
l was really worried
about Hank yesterday, though.

26:21.956 --> 26:23.742
He got this flu,
the same one that I had.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.744
But he got it much worse
than I did.

26:25.835 --> 26:27.700
- You were sick?

26:27.795 --> 26:30.457
Did you lips-- did they
get all blistered?

26:30.548 --> 26:32.584
- Yeah, yeah.
Why?

26:32.675 --> 26:34.586
Why? Is there
something going around?

26:40.808 --> 26:44.266
(approaching footsteps)

26:44.353 --> 26:46.969
- You're not out helping
your friends?

26:49.066 --> 26:50.397
(footsteps)

26:50.485 --> 26:54.524
They ordered you to hole up
with me, didn't they?

26:54.614 --> 26:57.071
(footsteps moving above)

26:57.158 --> 26:58.238
(door lock clangs)

26:58.326 --> 26:59.736
(doors squeaks)

26:59.827 --> 27:02.694
- (chuckles)
Lucky guess.

27:02.789 --> 27:03.778
(door slams)

27:03.873 --> 27:06.080
Doesn't make us
"birds of a feather."

27:06.167 --> 27:09.409
Besides, Dwight's not
entirely wrong.

27:09.504 --> 27:13.088
Though I may not have liked
the way he said it.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.416
Why am I talking
to you?

27:16.511 --> 27:18.923
- Because our goals
are aligned, Duke.

27:19.013 --> 27:23.097
Yours and your friends
are not.

27:23.184 --> 27:24.924
- You just want
to get out of jail.

27:25.019 --> 27:27.761
- And you want
to stay out.

27:27.855 --> 27:29.937
The game
has changed, Duke.

27:30.024 --> 27:33.357
Your freedom and my freedom
are linked.

27:33.444 --> 27:37.653
- Another prediction
from Mara the psychic.

27:37.740 --> 27:39.776
Or maybe I should
just say psycho.

27:39.867 --> 27:41.448
(chains rattling)

27:41.536 --> 27:43.777
- My predictions

27:43.871 --> 27:45.111
are not psychic.

27:45.206 --> 27:47.538
They're based on 500 years

27:47.625 --> 27:51.117
of watching humans
act out of fear.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.794
And I have two more
predictions for you.

27:53.881 --> 27:56.623
They're going to start
rounding up Troubled people.

27:56.717 --> 27:57.706
- (scoffs)

27:57.802 --> 28:00.589
- And your friends--

28:00.680 --> 28:02.671
your friends
will sell you out

28:02.765 --> 28:06.508
to save their own skin.

28:06.602 --> 28:08.467
- (scoffs)

28:08.563 --> 28:10.224
- You think I'm wrong?

28:13.401 --> 28:15.437
- Yeah.

28:15.528 --> 28:16.768
Yeah, I do.

28:18.489 --> 28:19.695
(door opens)

28:20.741 --> 28:23.027
(door closes)

28:23.119 --> 28:25.280
- Audrey says Hank and Eve
are both sick.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.362
Both are Troubled.
- Mr. Banks, too.

28:27.456 --> 28:28.741
Can't be a coincidence.

28:32.587 --> 28:35.078
I should have
seen this before.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.582
Everyone who got
the sickness is Troubled.

28:36.674 --> 28:38.335
- That's not good.

28:38.426 --> 28:40.166
If Troubled people
are getting sick,

28:40.261 --> 28:41.967
the stress can make
their Troubles come out.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.511
- Yeah, that's what happened
to Mr. Banks.

28:44.599 --> 28:46.840
- Eve's bears appeared
after Hank caught her illness.

28:46.934 --> 28:48.174
She was worried
about him.

28:48.269 --> 28:49.258
- Hank caught it
from Eve?

28:50.688 --> 28:52.178
- It's contagious.

28:52.273 --> 28:53.854
- Which means there's
more sick Troubled people

28:53.941 --> 28:55.681
in town that we
don't even know about.

28:55.776 --> 28:56.765
- We'll know about
all of them

28:56.861 --> 28:59.568
as soon as their
Troubles activate.

28:59.655 --> 29:01.270
So will the CDC.

29:01.365 --> 29:02.866
(indistinct PA announcement)

29:02.950 --> 29:05.566
(sighs)

29:05.661 --> 29:08.277
A sickness that infects
only Troubled people?

29:08.372 --> 29:10.909
I'm thinking the contagion
itself is a Trouble.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.240
- Has to be-- problem is,

29:12.335 --> 29:13.620
finding the person
causing the contagion,

29:13.711 --> 29:15.167
we have to launch
a medical investigation.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.710
- Which would attract
Charlotte's attention,

29:16.797 --> 29:18.958
and put her face to face
with Troubled people.

29:19.050 --> 29:20.790
- We have to get her
out of town... now.

29:22.136 --> 29:23.637
I might have an idea.
In the meantime, we have to get

29:23.721 --> 29:25.632
everybody who's sick out of
sight until Charlotte's gone.

29:25.723 --> 29:27.384
- I'll set up a secret ward.

29:27.475 --> 29:29.511
(cell phone jingles and buzzes)

29:29.602 --> 29:30.717
- Okay, but not here.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.642
Autopsy's over.
Charlotte's on her way back.

29:32.730 --> 29:34.436
Use the morgue.
- Okay.

29:40.363 --> 29:43.105
- Dwight.
Look at my leg.

29:43.199 --> 29:46.908
Feels ten times better.
She's a miracle worker.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.074
- Never had a doubt.

29:48.162 --> 29:49.322
(metallic squeak)

29:49.413 --> 29:51.870
Best lobster salad
in Maine.

29:51.958 --> 29:54.074
Comes with an apology
and a sincere wish

29:54.168 --> 29:55.908
that my team and I
had performed better.

29:56.003 --> 29:57.459
- Thank you.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.753
No new reports
of illness at least.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.456
- Guess whatever it was
just fizzled out.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.633
And I heard the autopsy
showed that Mr. Banks

30:04.720 --> 30:05.926
died of
a natural stroke?

30:06.013 --> 30:09.096
- Yes, but I sent PDFs
of Mr. Banks' brain slices

30:09.183 --> 30:11.799
to HQ for their take on it,
just to be safe.

30:11.894 --> 30:14.351
If they can confirm
Dr. Verrano's conclusions,

30:17.191 --> 30:18.271
- Speaking of,

30:18.359 --> 30:19.439
weather's great today
for a boat ride,

30:19.527 --> 30:21.609
which can be rare
around here.

30:21.696 --> 30:24.438
Buddy of mine operates
a terrific tour.

30:24.532 --> 30:27.274
Dave knows him, too.
My treat.

30:27.368 --> 30:30.485
- Oh, yeah.
Captain Murphy.

30:30.579 --> 30:31.955
Of course.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.576
There's no better way
to see the coast.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.407
- I'd like that.
- Great.

30:36.502 --> 30:37.662
Dave can show you
where the dock is,

30:37.753 --> 30:39.709
and then maybe after that,
we could, uh,

30:39.797 --> 30:41.207
finish that lobster dinner.

30:42.466 --> 30:44.127
- I'd like that, too.

30:44.218 --> 30:45.424
I'll freshen up
in the doctor's lounge

30:45.511 --> 30:46.671
before we go.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.298
Oh, but here.

30:48.389 --> 30:50.721
My analysis of
the sick patients' blood work.

30:50.808 --> 30:53.595
I found an unique genetic
marker in all of them.

30:53.686 --> 30:55.301
Not something you'd
usually look for,

30:55.396 --> 30:57.637
but they all had
the same illness.

30:57.732 --> 30:59.563
It should be nothing,

30:59.650 --> 31:01.732
but Dr. Palak should have it
just in case.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.065
Excuse me.

31:08.743 --> 31:11.325
- Vince is up in Bangor,
pulling political strings

31:11.412 --> 31:13.744
to get Dr. Cross
out of Haven,

31:13.831 --> 31:15.913
but we're going to beat
him to it, aren't we?

31:16.000 --> 31:20.414
You've arranged with Murph
to have "mechanical failure"

31:20.504 --> 31:24.213
about 30 miles outside of town,
leave her stranded, right?

31:24.300 --> 31:26.256
- That's the plan.

31:27.553 --> 31:28.884
- You all right
there, Chief?

31:31.015 --> 31:34.257
- She found a genetic marker
in all the patients.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.433
They're all Troubled.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.307
What if she found a genetic
basis for the Troubles?

31:46.030 --> 31:48.237
- Eve, I know you were
worried about losing Hank,

31:48.324 --> 31:51.862
but Hank loves you.

31:51.952 --> 31:55.911
- I'm with you,
for life.

31:55.998 --> 31:57.863
- See?
He's not gonna leave you.

31:57.958 --> 32:01.086
You have nothing
to worry about.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.215
- Okay.

32:05.299 --> 32:07.540
(cell phone buzzing)

32:10.429 --> 32:11.544
- Hey, Dwight,
what's up?

32:11.639 --> 32:13.254
-Need you to hurry
it up with Eve.

32:13.349 --> 32:14.714
A bear just appeared
outside the doctor's lounge.

32:14.809 --> 32:16.049
Charlotte's in there.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.883
- Just appeared?

32:17.978 --> 32:19.559
Well, I thought
the Trouble--

32:19.647 --> 32:21.103
- It's not.
Get it done, Audrey.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.771
We can't have one of these
bears blow the whole thing.

32:22.858 --> 32:24.723
We're really close.

32:24.819 --> 32:25.854
(phone beeps off)

32:27.154 --> 32:29.110
- It didn't work, did it?

32:29.198 --> 32:31.610
- Isn't there anything
that we can do?

32:31.700 --> 32:33.315
There's got
to be something.

32:36.497 --> 32:37.782
- (crying)

32:43.337 --> 32:44.372
- Okay.

32:46.674 --> 32:48.005
(phone ringing)

32:48.092 --> 32:50.128
- Yeah?
-Duke, I can ’t believe

32:50.219 --> 32:52.426
that I'm asking this,
but I need Mara ’3 help

32:52.513 --> 32:53.844
with a Trouble.

32:53.931 --> 32:54.920
[need to talk to her.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.846
- Okay.

33:01.355 --> 33:03.141
- (groans and chuckles)

33:04.859 --> 33:07.316
You want to get rid
of CDC lady?

33:07.403 --> 33:10.361
Then you're going to help Audrey
with this dancing bear Trouble.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.111
(sighs)

33:15.202 --> 33:18.069
- It's not going to stop her
from turning against us.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.825
- Play nice.

33:21.167 --> 33:25.206
Okay.
You're on with...

33:25.296 --> 33:26.786
each other.

33:26.881 --> 33:28.837
And, yes, it's weird.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.466
- Hi.
- (sweetly)Hello, Audrey.

33:32.553 --> 33:33.633
How are you?

33:33.721 --> 33:36.053
You haven't come
to see me.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.630
- Why would I?

33:37.725 --> 33:40.057
- Oh, I don't know.
To meet your maker?

33:40.144 --> 33:42.260
- You're not my maker.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.390
-Really?
Then who is? Duke?

33:44.481 --> 33:47.063
I don't if you can afford
such ontological certainty,

33:47.151 --> 33:50.894
being that you're a banana peel,
a nut shell, a husk.

33:50.988 --> 33:52.398
- Are you going
to help me or not?

33:54.241 --> 33:58.234
- (scoffs)
- All right, Audrey husk.

33:58.329 --> 34:00.069
Don ’t twist your knickers.

34:00.164 --> 34:02.496
You want to know about
the dancing bear Trouble.

34:02.583 --> 34:06.542
Well, I remember being trapped
inside of Lucy husk

34:06.629 --> 34:09.245
while she talked Eve through
her dead daddy issues.

34:09.340 --> 34:12.673
- Yes.
The Trouble is about loss.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.716
- An original recipe
as I ever made,

34:14.803 --> 34:16.543
which means if you're
failing at it,

34:16.639 --> 34:18.345
then you've lost
your mojo.

34:21.769 --> 34:23.600
- I said to play nice.

34:23.687 --> 34:25.393
- Come on, Duke.
It's true.

34:25.481 --> 34:27.767
I'm the candy,
she's the wrapper.

34:32.029 --> 34:33.940
- I'm sorry that wasn't
more helpful.

34:35.366 --> 34:37.072
- Duke, what if
she's right?

34:38.535 --> 34:40.787
- Look, you can't
start thinking like that.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.914
- Okay, all right, um...

34:45.000 --> 34:47.252
Listen, are you--

34:47.336 --> 34:48.701
are you feeling
sick at all?

34:48.796 --> 34:50.377
- No.
No, not yet.

34:50.464 --> 34:51.453
-Okay, good.

34:51.548 --> 34:52.628
'Cause a lot
of Troubled people

34:52.716 --> 34:55.298
have been infected, and...

34:55.386 --> 34:57.422
Nathan, he's starting
to bring them into the morgue.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.056
- Nathan's rounding up
Troubled people?

35:03.143 --> 35:05.930
- The sick ones, yeah.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.558
Listen, I really,
I gotta go.

35:13.737 --> 35:16.149
- I can help you.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.776
But if you keep
resisting me,

35:17.866 --> 35:20.448
it's only going to make this
more dangerous.

35:20.536 --> 35:22.822
Remember
what happens next.

35:22.913 --> 35:24.995
You get served up
on a silver platter

35:25.082 --> 35:26.663
by your friends.

35:29.211 --> 35:32.328
Duke, we need to take matters
into our own hands.

35:32.423 --> 35:34.459
- You're right.

35:35.843 --> 35:37.583
Except about
the "we" part.

35:44.143 --> 35:46.099
- Hank, I must stop
my Trouble.

35:46.186 --> 35:49.394
- You helped me
through my Troubles, Eve.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.348
I promise you,
we will beat this.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.024
(Eve sniffles)

35:54.111 --> 35:56.693
- There are so many people
in this town.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.031
There's so many people
we love.

35:58.115 --> 36:00.356
What if my bears
expose us all?

36:03.203 --> 36:04.579
- Exposure?

36:06.582 --> 36:10.291
The bears are designed
to present themselves to you.

36:10.377 --> 36:12.663
So if we take you
out of town...

36:16.342 --> 36:19.960
...maybe the bears will stop
showing up in Haven.

36:20.054 --> 36:21.965
J‘J‘

36:22.056 --> 36:23.421
(patients coughing)

36:23.515 --> 36:25.506
- Duke! Okay, they're not medically sick.

36:25.601 --> 36:26.636
They're Trouble sick.

36:26.727 --> 36:27.887
And everyone's upset,

36:27.978 --> 36:29.889
so their Trouble could
come out at any moment.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.481
So... what should I do?

36:31.565 --> 36:33.521
- Why the hell
are you asking me?

36:34.735 --> 36:36.271
- (groaning)

36:39.740 --> 36:42.106
- That's Lori Futcher's
little sister.

36:42.201 --> 36:43.190
Hey!
(snaps fingers)

36:43.285 --> 36:44.365
What's wrong with her?

36:44.453 --> 36:46.193
- She fainted and conked
her head on the floor.

36:46.288 --> 36:48.028
- We're running low
on supplies, Pete.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.079
- Okay, I'll go get more.
Just"

36:50.167 --> 36:52.032
Watch them.

36:52.127 --> 36:55.164
(patients groaning
and coughing)

36:55.255 --> 36:56.916
- I told you to stay
on the boat.

36:58.217 --> 37:01.550
- You were supposed to have
this under control.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.127
How did you let things
get this bad?

37:03.222 --> 37:05.008
- We're handling it, Duke,
so back off.

37:05.099 --> 37:06.259
- This is you handling it?

37:06.350 --> 37:07.556
Okay, first of all,

37:07.643 --> 37:09.053
you don't tell me
where I can go.

37:09.144 --> 37:10.133
(bulb shatters)

37:10.229 --> 37:12.390
- Help!
Danielle's doing something.

37:12.481 --> 37:14.938
(electricity crackling)

37:15.025 --> 37:17.107
- She has the same electrical
Trouble as her sister.

37:17.194 --> 37:19.185
- She's gonna fry us all
unless we can contain her.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.735
- How?
We can't even touch her.

37:20.823 --> 37:21.903
(zap)

37:21.990 --> 37:23.241
(clatter)

37:23.325 --> 37:25.236
(patients moaning)

37:26.870 --> 37:28.121
- We can with these.

37:30.791 --> 37:32.873
(electricity crackling)

37:32.960 --> 37:34.075
Now what?

37:36.422 --> 37:37.411
- Stick her in there.

37:37.506 --> 37:38.746
Hope the metal frame
grounds her.

37:38.841 --> 37:40.957
(electricity crackling)

37:43.011 --> 37:44.137
- Come on!

37:45.222 --> 37:46.462
Come on.
- We gotta hustle.

37:46.557 --> 37:48.468
(electricity crackling)

37:50.519 --> 37:51.554
- (grunting)

37:51.645 --> 37:52.760
(crash)

37:55.190 --> 37:56.305
(zap)
- (moaning)

37:58.068 --> 38:00.480
- (panting)

38:00.571 --> 38:01.902
You okay?

38:01.989 --> 38:04.776
- Yeah, I'm fine.

38:04.867 --> 38:06.357
- How the hell did
her Trouble get activated

38:06.452 --> 38:08.033
while she was
unconscious?

38:08.120 --> 38:09.735
(panting)
I mean...

38:09.830 --> 38:11.912
What is this?
The last stage of the sickness?

38:11.999 --> 38:15.116
- Maybe that's the point
of this contagion Trouble.

38:15.210 --> 38:17.121
Infect Troubled people
and force their Troubles out.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.749
- That's a lot of Troubles
going off all at once.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.080
(panting)

38:21.175 --> 38:22.915
- It means a lot of people
are gonna die.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.625
(patients moaning
and coughing)

38:26.847 --> 38:28.303
- "People are gonna die"?

38:28.390 --> 38:30.096
J‘J‘

38:30.184 --> 38:31.640
Like James Banks?

38:31.727 --> 38:33.433
HQ got back to me.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.136
Said Banks died of
an air bubble in the brain.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.311
The only way
that happens

38:37.399 --> 38:39.936
is if someone
purposely injects it.

38:40.027 --> 38:41.858
Banks was murdered.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.692
(banging)

38:50.370 --> 38:52.326
(drawer scraping)

38:52.414 --> 38:53.915
- You okay?

38:55.459 --> 38:57.165
- (coughs)

38:57.252 --> 38:58.958
- Hiding patients
in cadaver drawers?

38:59.046 --> 39:00.832
Whatever it is you think
you're accomplishing here,

39:00.923 --> 39:02.208
it's over.

39:02.299 --> 39:04.631
Under section 361
of the Public Service Act,

39:04.718 --> 39:07.926
I hereby place Haven, Maine,
under quarantine.

39:09.389 --> 39:11.675
Tanks are rolling in.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.177
Lots of 'em.

39:16.396 --> 39:19.729
J‘J‘

39:22.069 --> 39:25.482
J‘J‘

39:25.572 --> 39:29.190
- Charlotte.
Charlotte.

39:29.284 --> 39:30.865
- What I need you to do
is somehow

39:30.953 --> 39:33.444
I need you to make
this thing...

39:33.539 --> 39:36.030
uh, go away, okay?

39:37.417 --> 39:39.078
- Charlotte, wait.

39:39.169 --> 39:41.330
- Put me through
to the secretary.

39:41.421 --> 39:42.797
- Charlotte, please,
let me explain.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.542
- Yeah, explain yourself
to the jury.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.919
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm here.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.466
- I can't control it
like that!

39:48.554 --> 39:52.342
- Well, then, get mad.
Because this cell phone tower

39:52.432 --> 39:53.763
is literally going to
ruin your life!

39:53.850 --> 39:56.466
(electricity crackling)

39:56.562 --> 39:57.927
(explosion)

39:58.939 --> 40:00.179
(clank)

40:00.274 --> 40:04.187
- Madam Se--
Hello?

40:04.278 --> 40:05.939
- Get back inside!

40:06.029 --> 40:07.189
Man: What happened?

40:07.281 --> 40:08.316
- You did that, didn't you?

40:08.407 --> 40:09.817
- Just let me explain.

40:14.454 --> 40:15.785
- Just go to hell, okay?

40:23.880 --> 40:25.006
(van door shuts)

40:43.317 --> 40:44.602
- What's going on?

40:44.693 --> 40:47.184
- She found the secret ward
of Troubled people.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.439
She's calling
for backup.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.737
- We fried the cell tower
and cut the land line.

40:50.824 --> 40:52.735
- Well, she'll still bolt
the first chance she gets.

40:52.826 --> 40:54.566
- Which is why I'm gonna
lock her up with Mara.

40:54.661 --> 40:56.447
We'll see who wins.

40:56.538 --> 40:57.778
Hey.
- She's only trying to help.

40:57.873 --> 41:00.410
- Help?
Her "help" puts me in a cage.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.660
And if it's between
me in a cage

41:01.752 --> 41:03.288
and her in a cage...

41:03.378 --> 41:04.584
Well, I know what
my answer is.

41:04.671 --> 41:06.252
So should you.
- Let's just take a step back.

41:06.340 --> 41:08.080
- You know what, you're not
the only person in this town.

41:08.175 --> 41:09.506
You're not
the only one who's--

41:09.593 --> 41:10.799
- I'm not going to stand by
while tanks roll in.

41:10.886 --> 41:14.128
- Hey! We need to figure out
what we're gonna do.

41:16.099 --> 41:17.680
- I know what
I'm gonna do.

41:19.353 --> 41:21.264
(TASER clacking)

41:21.355 --> 41:23.471
- Dwight!
- You selfish prick.

41:23.565 --> 41:25.430
I'd sooner turn you in
to CDC headquarters

41:25.525 --> 41:27.140
then let you kidnap
an innocent woman.

41:28.737 --> 41:30.602
- We need to work together.
What are you doing?

41:30.697 --> 41:32.608
- I'm the chief of police,
and the leader of the Guard.

41:32.699 --> 41:34.985
You want to know
what Haven's going to do?

41:35.077 --> 41:36.567
Whatever I decide.

41:36.662 --> 41:38.118
Not you, that only
thinks about Audrey.

41:38.205 --> 41:41.117
And not you, who only
looks out for himself.

41:41.208 --> 41:42.414
- But we can'tjust
leave her in there

41:42.501 --> 41:45.208
while an epidemic of
Troubles blasts this town.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.286
You want to lead,
you better have a plan.

41:48.382 --> 41:49.838
-ldo.

42:01.311 --> 42:03.552
(waves lapping)

42:03.647 --> 42:05.729
(latch clicks,
door squeaks)

42:13.573 --> 42:15.609
- Is it bad?

42:15.701 --> 42:17.862
- You have no idea.

42:19.663 --> 42:22.279
- Do you still think
your friends have your back?

42:23.417 --> 42:24.452
- No.

42:26.420 --> 42:28.251
We're on our own.

42:28.338 --> 42:30.920

42:33.009 --> 42:36.001
