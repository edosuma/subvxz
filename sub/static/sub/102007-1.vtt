10:35.451 --> 10:36.876
Vocation is much more
than just a job.

10:37.028 --> 10:38.528
It's more like a calling.

10:38.588 --> 10:40.472
Well, I feel like being
a firefighter's my calling.

10:40.623 --> 10:42.215
PAUL: And some of us are lucky
when the two line up.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.033
-But when they don't?
-You gotta make a choice.

10:44.094 --> 10:45.810
Which Captain Blake did.

10:46.003 --> 10:47.553
Which was incredibly selfish.

10:47.706 --> 10:50.874
GILLIAN: Right, Tim, she
selfishly gave up job security

10:50.934 --> 10:52.817
to dedicate her life
to helping mentally ill people

10:52.986 --> 10:54.635
living on the streets.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.137
People like her sister.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.380
-What a monster.
-(small laugh)

10:57.399 --> 10:59.065
ROSEWATER:
She abandoned us, Nancy.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.884
For some new rando captain

11:00.902 --> 11:02.385
who hasn't been on the job
in, like, forever.

11:02.404 --> 11:04.812
You realize how much EMS
has changed since 2013?

11:04.873 --> 11:06.389
I remember 2013.

11:06.449 --> 11:08.816
-Live concerts.
-Nightclubs.

11:08.919 --> 11:10.243
Hugs.

11:10.395 --> 11:11.728
-You want a hug, Probie?
-I need a hug.

11:11.830 --> 11:13.579
You should've asked.
I'll give you a hug.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.748
Okay.
Cool.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.826
And this is your office.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.512
Wow.
(chuckles)

11:20.663 --> 11:23.072
Well, my last office was
more or less a broom closet.

11:23.133 --> 11:25.091
Well, we have one of those too
if you'd be more comfortable.

11:25.227 --> 11:27.334
I bet it's
a really nice broom closet.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.412
Yeah, it ain't bad
to be a broom in my firehouse.

11:29.431 --> 11:31.690
Hmm, well, I'd heard
you made some renovations,

11:31.883 --> 11:33.266
but I gotta tell you,

11:33.418 --> 11:35.251
I've never seen a firehouse
like this before.

11:35.311 --> 11:37.344
Actually, my inspiration was

11:37.406 --> 11:40.181
architectural designer
John Pawson.

11:41.443 --> 11:43.760
TOMMY: I don't know
if I have enough stuff

11:43.820 --> 11:45.036
to fill up this space.

11:45.188 --> 11:46.446
But it's not
as big at it looks.

11:46.598 --> 11:48.431
See, that's
the minimalist aesthetic.

11:48.491 --> 11:50.375
It...
(chuckles)

11:50.568 --> 11:51.859
I'll stop.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.694
You'll fill this place easily.

11:53.714 --> 11:57.106
I wasn't really talking
about filling the space.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.883
I was talking about the shoes.

11:59.076 --> 12:01.702
Michelle Blake was a rock star.

12:01.763 --> 12:02.887
You know Michelle?

12:03.080 --> 12:05.298
I should.
I trained her.

12:05.450 --> 12:07.392
Then, she comes
from a long line of rock stars

12:07.561 --> 12:09.394
because I hear the same thing
about you.

12:09.545 --> 12:11.896
I don't know
who you've been talking to.

12:12.089 --> 12:13.289
JUDD:
Hey, girl!

12:13.391 --> 12:14.807
Guess what I just found
in your truck.

12:14.901 --> 12:15.959
-TOMMY: Juddy.
-Hey.

12:16.019 --> 12:17.718
-(chuckles)
-Oh!

12:17.738 --> 12:20.721
You have no idea how hard it is
to social distance

12:20.782 --> 12:21.981
at this particular moment.

12:22.133 --> 12:23.299
I appreciate that.

12:23.318 --> 12:24.968
So, Owen, this is
my good friend, Tommy.

12:24.986 --> 12:28.321
She also happens to be the best
EMS captain in all of Texas.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.656
-We've met.
-Oh, you think you have.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.167
Wait till you see her work.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.329
-All right?
-She's very modest.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.072
Did I ever tell you, Cap,

12:38.091 --> 12:40.817
that Tommy did me
the supreme kindness

12:40.877 --> 12:42.243
of introducing me to my wife?

12:42.262 --> 12:45.989
-Many times.
-Well, it's still true.

12:46.090 --> 12:47.915
OWEN:
Well, I'll let you settle in,

12:47.976 --> 12:48.992
let you guys catch up.

12:49.052 --> 12:52.353
Captain, welcome to the 126.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.943
He's something, ain't he?

12:59.136 --> 13:00.853
He's something.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.688
Mm-hmm.

13:02.841 --> 13:04.190
So first day.

13:04.326 --> 13:07.452
I know it's not
the most fun circumstances,

13:07.621 --> 13:09.362
but how do you feel?

13:09.456 --> 13:13.032
Like I need a lot of Jesus
and a little bit of Jack.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.376
-I think you'll be great.
-TOMMY: Okay.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.874
Okay?
Look around.

14:53.935 --> 14:57.136

that Holly had the courage

her asshat of a boyfriend.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.291

She slid across the floor.

must have been sticking up.

-Run it wide open.
-Copy that.

37:42.761 --> 37:47.338
Tell me that...

37:47.491 --> 37:48.990
that is not
a solid French braid.

37:49.092 --> 37:52.844
TOMMY: Oh.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.512
-CHARLES: Boom.
-TOMMY: Oh, I see.

37:54.606 --> 37:57.089
Well, you know, Evie's symmetry
is just a little off,

37:57.150 --> 38:00.593
but, yeah, I'd say
that's a good, solid start.

38:00.654 --> 38:03.187
-It's a good start?
-Uh-huh.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.765
Shoot.
You give me a week.

38:05.826 --> 38:09.602
I'ma have those girls rocking
box braids and Marcel waves.

38:09.663 --> 38:12.271
(chuckles)
I bet you will too.

38:12.291 --> 38:16.167
-CHARLES: All right.
-You're my hero, you know that?

38:17.838 --> 38:19.462
Really?

38:21.157 --> 38:25.527
You're the one
who's climbing up a tower.

38:25.587 --> 38:27.253
-Getting shot at.
-Oh.

38:27.347 --> 38:31.123
Yeah, I saw the news.
Mm-hmm.

38:31.184 --> 38:35.312
Oh, well, believe me,
I have the easier job.

38:35.505 --> 38:36.962
Oh, you do, kinda.
Don't you?

38:37.024 --> 38:38.706
-Oh, and--
-What?

38:38.767 --> 38:41.484
-I need you to shut up.
-(zipper unzips)

38:41.653 --> 38:42.986
-Okay.
-Yeah.

38:47.868 --> 38:50.068
(both moaning)

38:50.220 --> 38:51.553
-(knock on door)
-Mm-mm, no.

38:51.613 --> 38:53.237
-CHARLES: Now, who the hell--
-(groans)

38:53.332 --> 38:55.648
Okay,
give me just one second.

38:56.192 --> 38:57.751
-TOMMY: Yeah, okay.
-CHARLES: All right.

39:00.172 --> 39:01.729
I don't believe this.

39:01.790 --> 39:03.731
TOMMY: (chuckles)

39:03.792 --> 39:04.899
Hey, y'all.

39:04.918 --> 39:06.401
We brought some cheesecake.

39:06.419 --> 39:07.752
Well, what are you doing here
at this hour?

39:07.904 --> 39:09.161
JUDD: You said
you wanted a little Jack.

39:09.181 --> 39:10.755
Well, I brought a lot of Jack.

39:10.891 --> 39:13.575
Anybody who makes a save like
that their first week back,

39:13.635 --> 39:15.076
and they're...

39:15.136 --> 39:17.595
(clears throat)
Gonna celebrate that.

39:17.747 --> 39:18.838
That's...

39:18.857 --> 39:20.190
TOMMY:
You didn't have to do that.

39:20.359 --> 39:21.749
-You really didn't.
-And we're not going to.

39:21.810 --> 39:22.859
This is for you.

39:23.052 --> 39:24.102
No, no, no, no.
Come on.

39:24.196 --> 39:25.678
Stop.
Come on in.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.848
-I'll get some plates.
-(groans)

39:28.909 --> 39:31.109
We'll talk about calling ahead.

39:31.203 --> 39:32.927
-I'm sorry, brother.
-Yeah.

39:32.987 --> 39:34.946
Oh, my fa--

39:35.040 --> 39:36.856
Mm-hmm, it better be
damn good cheesecake.

39:36.991 --> 39:38.375
Well...

39:44.257 --> 39:47.050
OWEN: Well, somebody's
anxious to leave.

39:47.243 --> 39:49.594
Oh, you know me.
I like to be ready.

39:53.633 --> 39:55.541
But my flight doesn't leave
till late tomorrow.

39:55.602 --> 39:58.395
Maybe in the morning, we can
have one last family hang.

39:58.546 --> 40:00.788
Finally get out to that bridge
with the--

40:00.890 --> 40:02.457
the thousands of bats.

40:02.517 --> 40:04.049
Yeah, 1.5 million bats.

40:04.111 --> 40:06.903
Yeah, I--I don't think
it's a good idea.

40:07.096 --> 40:09.797
Uh...
what about, uh, Barton Springs?

40:09.858 --> 40:11.557
It's where
all the hippies go topless.

40:11.618 --> 40:15.453
No, I mean I don't think it's
a good idea that you leave.

40:16.865 --> 40:19.490
Wait, you mean stay?
Why?

40:19.584 --> 40:22.176
Why not?
Come on.

40:22.178 --> 40:24.162
You have to admit
it's been really special

40:24.256 --> 40:27.573
having us all together
under the same roof again.

40:27.634 --> 40:31.152
Yeah, but it's also been like
living in a pressure cooker.

40:31.212 --> 40:33.245
We know how to release steam.

40:33.306 --> 40:36.641
Yes, we are excellent,
really, but...

40:39.721 --> 40:41.846
Are you serious?

40:41.940 --> 40:45.667
I'm not ready for you to go.

40:45.727 --> 40:47.277
What about the firm?

40:47.428 --> 40:50.021
They would lose their minds

40:50.157 --> 40:51.781
-if I didn't come back.
-OWEN: The firm?

40:51.933 --> 40:53.524
You mean the one
with your name on the door?

40:53.618 --> 40:55.952
Come on, I think you've been
working just fine from here

40:56.145 --> 40:57.102
for the last few months.

40:57.164 --> 40:59.104
But the pollen down here!

40:59.124 --> 41:00.623
It's--it's apocalyptic!

41:00.792 --> 41:02.366
And I've met
so many amazing people

41:02.461 --> 41:03.701
in the medical community.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.278
Look, Gwyn.

41:06.339 --> 41:09.691
Remember when you said
we both know what this is?

41:09.792 --> 41:12.543
I'm not so sure we do.

41:12.637 --> 41:14.879
Or what it could be.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.806
Don't you want to find out?

41:16.999 --> 41:20.535

41:20.553 --> 41:22.053

just trying to get out

41:22.189 --> 41:24.038
of driving me to the airport?

41:24.057 --> 41:27.150
I was just gonna
put you in an Uber.

41:27.343 --> 41:30.487
This could end in homicide.

41:30.680 --> 41:32.447
It could.

41:35.494 --> 41:37.977
But how many times are we
gonna get a second chance

41:38.038 --> 41:41.289
at the best relationship
of our lives?

41:43.001 --> 41:45.168
Oh, crap.
(laughs)

41:45.361 --> 41:47.395
We're gonna have to tell TK

41:47.455 --> 41:49.488
if that's what's
really been going on.

41:49.549 --> 41:51.174
TK: TK knows.

41:51.367 --> 41:53.918
-What do you know?
-TK: More than any son should.

41:54.054 --> 41:56.904
The walls here are
not that thick.

41:56.965 --> 41:58.497
Who else knows?

41:58.558 --> 42:00.433
Everybody.

42:03.063 --> 42:05.413
-Well, he's a wise-ass.

young and adorable?
