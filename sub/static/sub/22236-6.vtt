WEBVTT

00:00.757 --> 00:04.320
If we don't exist, we don't have
to follow any boring rules.

00:04.354 --> 00:06.354
<i>We can do anything we want.</i>

00:06.387 --> 00:08.473
Whoa. Lucky we don't exist.

00:08.484 --> 00:10.444
I'll be here all day.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.987
There was a break and enter
at Bremin High last weekend.

00:12.988 --> 00:15.052
- You know anything about that?
- No.

00:15.053 --> 00:17.000
That cop.
He's my dad.

00:17.001 --> 00:19.185
<i>Our non-existence
has changed this world.</i>

00:19.200 --> 00:22.689
<i>In the old world, your mother was
single and your father was a loser.</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:25.530
So, by being born, I ruined
both my parents' lives, yeah?

00:25.531 --> 00:26.751
Hey!

00:28.377 --> 00:31.688
You were with the guy from the bus.
He saved my life.

00:31.926 --> 00:35.566
This is very special. It can
protect against elemental attacks.

00:36.002 --> 00:38.966
There's a swarm of killer alien bees
right outside that door.

00:39.126 --> 00:42.382
The Divinity of the Elements,
I invoke Thee.

Season 1, Episode 6

01:31.285 --> 01:34.285
Synced by Stubbie & Reef
www.addic7ed.com

01:37.217 --> 01:40.260
___

01:41.766 --> 01:48.466
Tonight, <i>cher Gary</i>,
I offer you 'des haricots' baked.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.272
- How's your mum?
- She's fine.

01:52.273 --> 01:55.364
Anyone else, you know,
on the scene?

01:57.366 --> 01:59.567
How're you gonna cook
when they cut your gas off?

01:59.568 --> 02:06.092
Mate, the thing you gotta learn is
every obstacle is an opportunity.

02:07.238 --> 02:08.717
<i>Voilà.</i>

02:11.610 --> 02:13.090
That'll be Mum.

02:22.624 --> 02:24.464
Come in.

02:24.631 --> 02:29.263
I am working ten-hour shifts
just to cover the rent.

02:29.286 --> 02:33.251
And his feet are growing so fast, I've got
to buy him runners every four months.

02:33.352 --> 02:34.752
You wanna stay for tea?

02:34.753 --> 02:39.012
Gary, I know there's a yeast content in
beer, but I wouldn't exactly call it food.

02:39.013 --> 02:42.045
Come on.
It's very <i>à la carte</i> here.

02:42.046 --> 02:45.687
I can offer you baked beans
with salt or baked beans without.

02:45.688 --> 02:48.353
I just need you
to pay your share, OK?

02:48.354 --> 02:49.589
Jake,
come on.

02:49.590 --> 02:51.612
Yeah, well I've got
a couple of irons in the fire.

02:51.613 --> 02:54.355
Well, you'd better take 'em out
before the house burns down.

02:58.166 --> 03:00.737
- See ya, Dad.
- Yeah, see you, mate.

03:02.086 --> 03:04.677
You want to get
some takeaway at the market?

03:12.366 --> 03:14.275
Get down.
It's the cops.

03:32.578 --> 03:34.058
You were right.

03:34.885 --> 03:37.610
By being born,
I wrecked my parents' lives.

03:37.611 --> 03:39.252
I didn't put it like that exactly,

03:39.253 --> 03:41.978
and anyway,
change isn't necessarily better.

03:41.979 --> 03:43.419
- Really?
- Well...

03:43.420 --> 03:46.179
Cops have notorious cholesterol
and hypertension issues.

03:46.285 --> 03:47.870
And in a survey I read,

03:47.871 --> 03:51.902
real estate agents rated below
telemarketers in trustworthiness.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.516
OK, all clear.

04:01.166 --> 04:04.387
I can't believe it's come to this.
Other people's rubbish?

04:04.388 --> 04:07.475
You've been a great help, Sam.
Really, don't put yourself out.

04:07.476 --> 04:10.639
Dude, if you want a whole heap
of useless junk, that's your business.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.341
This isn't junk.
Did you know that in this country,

04:13.342 --> 04:16.781
we throw out more than $5 billion
worth of stuff every year?

04:16.952 --> 04:20.908
Better to reuse what we've already got.
It's a philosophy called <i>Freeganism</i>.

04:21.072 --> 04:25.730
- <i>Freegan</i>, huh? That's pretty cool.
- Oh, you just made that word up.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.267
- What are you eating?
- Nothing...?

04:38.921 --> 04:42.721
I don't know if the gas is gonna work,
but here's hoping.

04:43.272 --> 04:45.085
- Turn it, doofus.
- Oh.

04:46.656 --> 04:48.136
Oh, good work!

04:48.137 --> 04:51.630
Who's up for a home cooked meal?
I do a pretty mean BLT.

04:51.631 --> 04:53.851
Small problem -
we don't have food.

04:53.962 --> 04:56.125
- Well, we'll go shopping.
- With what?

04:56.126 --> 04:58.862
- Your money should get us some basics.
- What money?

04:58.863 --> 05:01.045
The money you earned
from skate busking.

05:01.046 --> 05:03.966
Ah... Low blood sugar -
needed chocolate.

05:03.967 --> 05:07.283
- You spent it, didn't you?
- It was only a couple of bucks.

05:07.506 --> 05:08.866
<i>Selfish fool...</i>

05:09.190 --> 05:13.110
Well, I guess we're <i>Freegans</i>, then.
So who's coming shopping? Not you.

05:13.111 --> 05:15.591
I'll come. Although <i>Freegans</i>
don't actually shop.

05:15.592 --> 05:17.390
- Look, you coming or not?
- Yeah.

05:17.631 --> 05:18.991
Great.

05:23.446 --> 05:28.013
- I was gonna share. I was just so hun...
- We're all hungry, Sam.

05:32.090 --> 05:35.510
You know there's not a lot
of edible material in hard rubbish?

05:35.511 --> 05:37.048
We're not going
back there.

05:37.499 --> 05:40.796
We're not? But <i>Freegans</i> don't have a lot
of choice about where they shop.

05:40.797 --> 05:43.963
We don't have a lot of choice because
a loser, otherwise known as Sam,

05:43.964 --> 05:45.862
ate our only chance
of a decent meal.

05:45.863 --> 05:48.298
Yeah...
Bad form.

05:49.079 --> 05:52.018
And to think that in the old world,
you two were good friends.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.063
Yeah, well, in the old world
I had a mum, a dad,

05:55.064 --> 05:57.971
a comfortable bed,
access to a fridge full of food...

05:58.667 --> 06:00.416
Things change.

06:23.086 --> 06:26.084
The definition of <i>Freeganism</i>
is taking the discarded,

06:26.085 --> 06:28.645
not stealing
before it gets discarded.

06:29.028 --> 06:31.348
Fine, then.
Jump back in the dumpster.

06:31.976 --> 06:35.296
Well, I guess we shouldn't get
too hung up on technicalities.

06:36.034 --> 06:37.394
Get back to work.

07:41.566 --> 07:43.046
Sergeant Riles.

07:45.614 --> 07:49.155
Taking free samples is technically
within the philosophy of <i>Freeganism</i>.

07:49.156 --> 07:50.452
Hi.

07:50.857 --> 07:52.060
Hi?

07:52.586 --> 07:55.057
That side doesn't have
a security camera.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.818
Interesting fact. Not sure why you
think that would be relevant to me.

07:58.819 --> 08:01.255
- You're new in town.
- Am I?

08:01.298 --> 08:05.298
- Hmm, mysterious.
- Yes, I am.

08:06.990 --> 08:09.531
<i>Well, I'm Ellen.</i>

08:15.166 --> 08:17.785
Andy! When I say 'run',
we've gotta run, OK?

08:17.786 --> 08:18.999
OK.

08:19.105 --> 08:20.863
Been nice chatting to
you but I've got to...

08:20.864 --> 08:22.066
Run!

08:23.058 --> 08:25.858
Hey, you! Get back here!

08:25.859 --> 08:27.939
Cop chase. Cool.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.460
Stop! Police!

08:31.873 --> 08:33.352
Stop!

08:40.811 --> 08:42.789
Stop! Police!

08:48.479 --> 08:51.345
- Jake, this way!
- You go. I got this.

08:56.728 --> 08:58.219
What's your name?

08:58.573 --> 09:00.338
- Jake.
- Jake who?

09:00.372 --> 09:01.728
Just Jake.

09:01.729 --> 09:06.257
Well, <i>Just Jake</i>, you're coming
with me. Let's go, come on.

09:08.608 --> 09:11.292
'Air, Fire, Earth, Water.'

09:12.504 --> 09:15.301
'One alone
can no change make.'

09:17.835 --> 09:21.400
- 'But if the Elements all awake...'
- Lovely afternoon.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.340
Why are you following me?
You know how creepy that is?

09:25.341 --> 09:27.768
I see you survived
the attack of the killer bees?

09:27.769 --> 09:29.318
Yeah,
thanks.

09:30.045 --> 09:34.028
- Did you use magic?
- Well, we did have insect spray.

09:35.243 --> 09:37.643
You said you were
the real thing, Felix.

09:37.803 --> 09:40.043
You're not gonna
disappoint me, are you?

09:40.447 --> 09:45.687
Yeah, I think I'm the real deal.
I mean, I could be. Theoretically.

09:45.688 --> 09:49.445
- So how's my talisman going?
- Good. Except it doesn't work.

09:49.446 --> 09:50.749
- Sure about that?
- Yeah.

09:50.750 --> 09:53.777
- Oh, well, it was worth a try.
- That's cool. I'll keep it.

09:53.803 --> 09:57.541
- Not much point, if it doesn't work.
- I can keep trying.

09:58.955 --> 10:00.755
I've got my eye on you.

10:13.108 --> 10:15.195
Turn left.

10:16.854 --> 10:19.416
Right, let's go.
Get on with it.

10:20.925 --> 10:22.405
Address?

10:24.712 --> 10:26.112
Phone number?

10:28.325 --> 10:30.089
Parents' names?

10:31.618 --> 10:33.369
I could sit here all day
if I have to,

10:33.376 --> 10:36.475
so you might as well cut to the chase
and tell me who your parents are.

10:36.476 --> 10:39.837
- They're probably worried sick.
- You think so?

10:41.771 --> 10:43.227
So how's this sound for you?

10:43.228 --> 10:46.240
You tell me who your parents are and
we'll drop these shoplifting charges.

10:46.241 --> 10:49.556
- I don't know who they are.
- You really expect me to believe that?

10:49.557 --> 10:52.729
I don't care what you believe!
I don't know who they are

10:52.730 --> 10:54.705
and I couldn't contact them
even if I wanted to.

10:54.706 --> 10:58.230
Well, unless you remember who they are,
I'm not gonna be able to release you,

10:58.231 --> 11:01.071
so you'll be staying here
for as long as it takes.

11:01.409 --> 11:04.165
Well, fine,
I'll stay here with you.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.468
<i>We're all hungry, Sam.</i>

11:27.869 --> 11:32.545
So, Jake, know anything about
a break-in at Bremin High School?

11:32.768 --> 11:34.248
No.

11:50.447 --> 11:51.927
Gotcha.

12:13.723 --> 12:15.203
Hey, fellas.

12:16.595 --> 12:19.762
Very unnerving,
but nothing to panic about.

12:27.243 --> 12:28.723
RUN!

12:31.082 --> 12:33.668
This is the kid
you were with, isn't it?

12:37.157 --> 12:39.540
I'm gonna give you
a bit of advice, mate.

12:39.554 --> 12:42.405
If you don't tell me who you are
and who this other kid is,

12:42.406 --> 12:45.132
then there's gonna be
dire consequences.

12:45.133 --> 12:46.725
Whoa, now you're scaring me.

12:46.726 --> 12:48.583
It's not gonna be funny
in ten years time,

12:48.584 --> 12:50.095
when you're in no hope,
with no money, no job.

12:50.096 --> 12:52.416
Yeah, my mum used to say
the same thing about my dad.

12:52.417 --> 12:53.689
How did he end up?

12:54.472 --> 12:56.942
A loser.
Well, he was a loser.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.596
He's doing much better now,
by the looks of things.

13:06.910 --> 13:08.206
I think they got Jake.

13:08.218 --> 13:10.472
- The crows?
- No, the cops.

13:11.412 --> 13:14.300
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee.

13:14.301 --> 13:16.567
- Is a poem the right response?
- We have to get him back.

13:16.568 --> 13:19.845
He's probably loving it - a bed for the
night, free food. How bad could it be?

13:19.846 --> 13:22.943
We have to rescue him. The talisman
won't work if we're not all together.

13:22.944 --> 13:24.416
Here we go.
Dark Arts 101...

13:24.417 --> 13:26.235
- The security camera.
- What?

13:26.261 --> 13:28.151
At the school, when
we broke in. I saw it.

13:28.152 --> 13:31.691
- Ye-yeah, me too. Me too.
- It's got footage of us trashing the gym.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.983
The cops will have
the footage, for sure.

13:34.984 --> 13:37.393
Jake's been arrested, it won't take
them long to find the rest of us.

13:37.394 --> 13:39.004
So what do we do?

13:39.300 --> 13:42.042
We have to learn to think
outside the box, Sam.

14:01.310 --> 14:03.463
Did you always
wanna be a cop?

14:03.737 --> 14:07.526
Enough with the questions. You don't
answer mine, I don't answer yours.

14:07.527 --> 14:09.128
___

14:13.125 --> 14:15.178
Yeah, coming up zero here.

14:16.625 --> 14:18.667
Can you give them a call?

14:19.670 --> 14:23.139
Yeah, I know, mate,
but I've got no other options.

14:26.495 --> 14:29.253
So even when you're a kid, you knew
that's what you wanted to do?

14:29.254 --> 14:32.647
I don't know about that, mate, but
definitely once I finished school.

14:32.648 --> 14:35.855
- And then something got in your way.
- Nothing got in my way.

14:35.856 --> 14:38.761
I had a dream
and I made it happen.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.580
Yeah, see ya, mate.

14:44.366 --> 14:45.575
Right.

14:45.576 --> 14:47.901
You ever considered a career
in the Force?

14:47.902 --> 14:49.441
- No.
- Don't discount it.

14:49.442 --> 14:50.870
Could turn your
life around.

14:51.683 --> 14:55.443
As a kid, I had a few issues
on the home front too.

14:55.444 --> 14:59.080
But you know what? Out of
every obstacle, comes opportunity.

14:59.081 --> 15:01.161
What the Force gives you
is purpose.

15:01.162 --> 15:04.342
They're not just your work,
they're your family as well.

15:04.343 --> 15:08.620
- So you're not married?
- "Married to the job", as they say.

15:08.621 --> 15:13.261
With the hours I work, it's the best
I can do to look after a dog.

15:13.952 --> 15:16.347
Zeus. He comes to every game.

15:16.607 --> 15:18.782
Come on, The Bandies.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.870
This is a very powerful magnet.

15:25.922 --> 15:29.162
Exposing the security footage
to an alternative magnetic field

15:29.163 --> 15:30.523
will remove all data.

15:30.524 --> 15:32.867
That's pretty anti-establishment
of you, Andy.

15:32.868 --> 15:34.433
We'll make a Goth of you yet.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.198
Yeah, that's great but how are we
gonna get into the police station

15:37.199 --> 15:38.812
so we can erase
all the footage?

15:42.243 --> 15:44.043
- Maybe I can help.
- Creepy...

15:44.044 --> 15:45.444
What are you doing here?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.376
You need an adult to help get you
into the police station.

15:47.377 --> 15:49.418
We still have to get
past the crows.

15:50.994 --> 15:55.201
- Dude, we found a stove, not a microwave.
- It's not for us.

16:02.535 --> 16:05.991
One, two, three.

16:09.001 --> 16:10.239
Now!

16:18.443 --> 16:22.198
- What do you run a hundred in?
- I've done a hundred in 12.3.

16:22.302 --> 16:25.290
That's pretty good, mate.
I struggle to do below 13.

16:25.291 --> 16:27.026
Really? You outran me before.

16:27.027 --> 16:30.385
You had bacon down your pants.
It's a pretty severe handicap.

16:31.271 --> 16:33.602
- You hungry?
- Yeah, starving.

16:33.603 --> 16:36.443
- I've got another can out the back.
- Make it two..?

16:37.525 --> 16:40.858
- Sergeant Gary Riles.
- Janet Hawker. Child Protection Services.

16:43.243 --> 16:45.725
I'll just...
Get the beans.

17:01.526 --> 17:07.046
What you need to understand, Jake,
is that this here is a safe space.

17:07.282 --> 17:09.042
Do you understand that?

17:09.203 --> 17:14.723
So, why don't you start at
the beginning and tell me the truth.

17:15.463 --> 17:17.704
- You want the truth?
- I do.

17:17.803 --> 17:21.435
- The whole truth?
- Absolutely.

17:25.759 --> 17:27.159
Okay, then.

17:28.637 --> 17:31.237
There was this school excursion
into the forest.

17:36.243 --> 17:39.761
- So why is Creepy Lady helping us?
- I don't know.

17:39.762 --> 17:43.201
- Maybe she likes us?
- Well, I am pretty irresistible.

17:43.202 --> 17:46.202
- Get a move on, airhead.
- I think she's resisting you.

17:46.203 --> 17:50.247
So, Phoebe, what's the plan?
How are you gonna get us inside?

17:50.248 --> 17:54.402
The plan is, I talk, you say nothing.
Wanna practise?

17:54.403 --> 17:57.386
- What exactly are you gonna say?
- I talk, you say nothing.

17:57.387 --> 17:58.817
- How hard is that?
- But I can...

17:58.818 --> 18:00.684
I talk.
You say nothing.

18:01.236 --> 18:03.971
- She really is weird.
- I heard that!

18:04.605 --> 18:07.769
Look.
The crows are back.

18:12.564 --> 18:16.164
So what we have here is a classic
case of delusional disorder.

18:16.165 --> 18:19.605
It often stems from an inability
to accept a difficult home life.

18:20.853 --> 18:23.101
Which is why he won't say
who his parents are?

18:23.109 --> 18:25.531
In cases like this, it's very common

18:25.532 --> 18:28.851
to replace reality
with a fantastical alternative.

18:29.193 --> 18:33.033
Mind you, I'm not sure I've ever
heard one this fantastical.

18:34.039 --> 18:37.150
So if you could keep trying
to contact his family,

18:37.151 --> 18:40.311
and I will get him settled
into a supported care facility.

18:40.354 --> 18:41.962
Are you sure
that's necessary?

18:42.854 --> 18:46.274
Sergeant Riles, this boy needs
to be monitored by professionals.

18:46.275 --> 18:47.880
Yes, of course.

18:53.667 --> 18:54.906
Get in!

19:02.682 --> 19:05.598
- What is it with these creepy crows?
- Another attack?

19:05.599 --> 19:06.959
Obviously.

19:07.377 --> 19:08.944
- Haven't worked it out yet?
- No.

19:08.945 --> 19:10.548
What was that?

19:10.549 --> 19:11.997
Kamikaze crows!

19:11.998 --> 19:14.238
- Did you just scream like a girl?
- No.

19:14.239 --> 19:16.435
What will happen
if we can't get to Jake in time?

19:16.436 --> 19:18.932
- He'll be fostered out, probably.
- We can't let that happen.

19:18.933 --> 19:21.897
- He's our friend.
- Oh, I feel touched.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.605
- By nausea.
- Will you just hurry up?

19:40.223 --> 19:44.562
Listen, mate, I'm sorry,
but you gave me no choice.

19:44.563 --> 19:46.486
You may have been a no-hoper,

19:46.487 --> 19:49.604
but one thing my dad would
never do is betray me.

19:50.097 --> 19:51.572
What's that about?

19:54.533 --> 19:56.013
Phoebe.

19:56.014 --> 20:00.521
And three boys, one of whom's
already contravened the law

20:00.522 --> 20:02.602
and another,
who looks familiar.

20:02.603 --> 20:05.315
I thought I told you
to unstack the dishwasher.

20:05.316 --> 20:06.951
- Huh?
- You know each other?

20:07.281 --> 20:09.922
- Oh, yeah, she's my...
- Aunty.

20:09.923 --> 20:11.654
Oh, yep, right.

20:11.946 --> 20:13.613
They're all cousins.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.849
Well, he's a...
Step-cousin.

20:17.993 --> 20:20.469
Alright, boys, let's go.
Who's on dinner duty?

20:20.470 --> 20:24.766
Yeah, nice try, Phoebe, but they're
not going anywhere. Inside. Now.

20:30.683 --> 20:32.580
- Whoa...
- Move it.

20:39.799 --> 20:42.399
Righto, I'm sure
you'll all be relieved to know

20:42.400 --> 20:48.096
that the mystery of the school
break-in has finally been solved.

20:57.372 --> 21:00.886
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee.

21:02.650 --> 21:07.373
Earth, Water, Air, Fire,
I invoke Thee.

21:10.338 --> 21:12.333
Must be an electrical fault.

21:26.855 --> 21:28.655
You saw it.
It was him.

21:28.656 --> 21:31.175
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- On the tape. I showed it to you.

21:31.176 --> 21:34.178
- Tell them.
- Maybe it was a delusion.

21:36.515 --> 21:39.892
Oh, don't worry. Janet says
it's a perfectly treatable disorder.

21:43.118 --> 21:46.433
Hey! You can't just
take them like that.

21:46.434 --> 21:49.163
Why not, Sergeant? You've got
nothing to charge them with.

21:49.164 --> 21:51.199
Yeah, well, maybe not
for the school break-in,

21:51.200 --> 21:53.473
but there are other charges
related to shoplifting.

21:56.711 --> 21:58.191
Charge away.

22:00.801 --> 22:02.153
Never mind.

22:04.745 --> 22:06.358
Where the hell is Sam?

22:09.120 --> 22:11.435
You saved me, so the least
I could do is save you.

22:11.436 --> 22:12.693
Thanks,
Andy.

22:12.926 --> 22:14.602
Interesting, isn't it?

22:14.603 --> 22:17.443
I thought security footage
would all be digital these days,

22:17.477 --> 22:20.862
so a magnet like that
wouldn't have any effect.

22:22.114 --> 22:26.034
Well, <i>my nephews</i>, how about
you come have dinner at my place?

22:26.035 --> 22:29.246
That's cool,
but Jake's cooking so...

22:30.228 --> 22:35.477
It's not happening, OK?
She was stalking us. Remember?

22:36.943 --> 22:39.080
Hang on,
are we missing someone?

22:39.659 --> 22:42.339
Hey, you!
That's confiscated!

22:51.043 --> 22:54.406
Here's to Andy, for saving our butts.

22:54.546 --> 22:57.482
And to Felix for knocking back
our first home-cooked meal.

22:59.163 --> 23:01.243
Did some more skate busking.

23:03.068 --> 23:04.780
- Yeah...
- Yeah!

23:19.643 --> 23:22.191
Man, this is the best BLT
I've ever eaten.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.152
- Even without the B.
- Or the L.

23:24.462 --> 23:25.731
Or the T.

23:32.921 --> 23:34.302
Zeus!

23:34.514 --> 23:36.998
Here, boy!
Come on!

23:37.447 --> 23:38.991
Zeus!

23:39.080 --> 23:41.160
Come on!

23:42.469 --> 23:43.693
Zeus!

23:45.683 --> 23:47.611
Come on, boy!

23:48.323 --> 23:49.683
Zeus!

24:09.364 --> 24:11.830
Yeah, I still don't get why
we have to go to school.

24:11.831 --> 24:13.944
You want the police off your backs,
you go to school.

24:13.945 --> 24:17.741
- These boys are new to the area...
- And we're here for an exchange.

24:17.742 --> 24:21.342
- Different universe, same Sam.
- They're not looking at you, man.

24:21.343 --> 24:22.908
You saved the girl
from the bus!

24:23.394 --> 24:26.013
Nice shot, mate.
This guy's a natural.

24:27.099 --> 24:31.243
- I don't get what Mia sees in that jerk.
- You and Sammy, you're sort of similar.

24:31.755 --> 24:33.746
Fight! Fight! Fight!

24:34.181 --> 24:37.188
- Brothers, torn apart by a savage war.
- Brother...?

24:37.189 --> 24:39.363
Do you wanna help after school?
Putting up flyers?

24:39.364 --> 24:41.911
I never realised being popular
was so stressful.

24:41.912 --> 24:44.079
Being unpopular sucks too.

24:45.451 --> 24:47.603
Whatever you do,
don't look him in the eye.

24:47.604 --> 24:48.964
Oh, my God!

24:51.590 --> 24:53.116
It's no use,
it's locked!
