<i>Basketball is a vehicle.</i>

00:57.424 --> 00:59.392
<i>It's not the end all of the be all.</i>

00:59.492 --> 01:02.655
<i>It's a vehicle to get you</i>
<i>from point A to point B.</i>

01:05.298 --> 01:07.858
<i>Use basketball, don't let it use you.</i>

01:18.578 --> 01:21.638
<i>Here at Value City Arena,</i>

01:21.748 --> 01:24.182
<i>they've taken on all comers all season long.</i>

01:24.284 --> 01:26.684
<i>They've played in New Jersey</i>
<i>and North Carolina.</i>

01:26.786 --> 01:29.949
<i>A national schedule.</i>
<i>Number-one team in the country.</i>

01:30.056 --> 01:32.684
<i>You know, you certainly think that this team</i>

01:32.792 --> 01:35.556
<i>has put themselves right up there</i>
<i>with the great Middletown teams,</i>

01:35.662 --> 01:39.962
<i>the Cleveland St. Jo teams,</i>
<i>the East teams, Wehrle, all of those.</i>

01:40.500 --> 01:43.731
<i>Let me just say</i>
<i>to all of you in attendance today,</i>

01:44.304 --> 01:47.740
<i>you are part of the largest crowd</i>
<i>ever to witness</i>

01:47.841 --> 01:51.504
<i>a championship game</i>
<i>in the history of Ohio.</i>

01:53.913 --> 01:58.976
<i>James, Joyce, Cotton and McGee</i>
<i>have all been here four consecutive years.</i>

01:59.252 --> 02:05.418
<i>They've all won 100 games trying to become</i>
<i>a three-time winner with this group.</i>

02:12.799 --> 02:14.733
<i>You have a chance to go down</i>
<i>as the greatest team</i>

02:14.834 --> 02:17.098
in high-school basketball history.

02:17.203 --> 02:21.299
You know, that's gonna be around here
long after you guys are gone.

02:21.508 --> 02:23.100
You've taken it full circle, fellas.

02:24.310 --> 02:29.942
This all started in a little gym
with a linoleum floor on Maple Street,

02:30.250 --> 02:31.376
at The Salvation Army.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.677
All the travel we've done,

02:33.786 --> 02:37.449
from the time you guys were 11 years old,
all the way across the country,

02:37.557 --> 02:40.617
through high school,
all the way to culminate,

02:40.727 --> 02:44.629
when that bus pulls up tomorrow,
where at? On Maple Street.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.533
And the only question right now is,

02:48.635 --> 02:52.594
"Do you get off
that bus tomorrow victorious?"

02:57.977 --> 02:59.706
All right, let's go.

03:13.860 --> 03:17.352
<i>So, here we go.</i>
<i>The championship game in Division II.</i>

03:17.463 --> 03:22.093
<i>St. Vincent-St. Mary's</i>
<i>with a national championship on the line.</i>

04:12.552 --> 04:15.885
<i>Growing up,</i>
<i>I had one coach who I looked up to a lot.</i>

04:18.224 --> 04:21.591
<i>I learned a lot from him, and I just thought</i>
<i>that he was someone that,</i>

04:21.694 --> 04:24.629
<i>you know, I could model my life after.</i>

04:26.799 --> 04:30.496
<i>Coming out of college,</i>
<i>I got caught up in corporate America</i>

04:30.670 --> 04:33.571
and really lost my dream
of becoming a coach.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.599
<i>It's kind of always a delicate situation.</i>

04:37.710 --> 04:40.406
<i>You know, you don't want to live</i>
<i>your dream through your child,</i>

04:40.513 --> 04:44.313
but you want to have them enjoy the things
that you have enjoyed.

04:45.652 --> 04:47.517
<i>Myself and some of the brothers</i>
<i>from our church,</i>

04:47.620 --> 04:51.420
<i>we would go every Saturday morning</i>
<i>and have pickup basketball.</i>

04:51.524 --> 04:55.324
<i>Dru was there and you could just see</i>
<i>that he had a love for the game.</i>

04:55.428 --> 04:59.455
<i>I was one of those parents who just came</i>
<i>to every practice that I could come to,</i>

04:59.565 --> 05:02.398
<i>and so the parents just asked me,</i>
<i>"Why don't you coach the team?"</i>

05:02.502 --> 05:04.766
<i>So I jumped at the opportunity.</i>

05:08.074 --> 05:10.907
I can remember having a conversation
with a gentleman in my church,

05:11.010 --> 05:15.037
telling him that I was about to coach
this travel basketball team,

05:15.815 --> 05:17.783
and he happened to be on the board
of The Salvation Army

05:17.884 --> 05:21.684
and he said he could arrange
a place for us to practice, so...

05:22.622 --> 05:27.559
This is where it started.
This is where we came together as a team.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.154
<i>Basketball was just so much fun.</i>

05:33.266 --> 05:35.791
<i>It was a whole new world.</i>
<i>That was my playground.</i>

05:35.968 --> 05:39.597
<i>I mean, I looked forward</i>
<i>to going to the basketball court.</i>

05:39.706 --> 05:41.697
<i>Dru was kind of a hothead.</i>

05:42.508 --> 05:46.103
<i>When he was young, five,</i>
<i>I'd have to play until I let him win.</i>

05:46.212 --> 05:49.340
You know, I mean, that's just who he was.

05:49.982 --> 05:54.282
We would play 10 games of one-on-one.
I'm like, "Hey, I gotta beat you.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.285
"I'm not leaving till I win."

05:57.623 --> 06:01.354
<i>We had trouble keeping players</i>
<i>on the team, and I knew a very good player</i>

06:01.461 --> 06:04.157
<i>and his name</i>
<i>happened to be LeBron James.</i>

06:05.932 --> 06:08.400
<i>He let us know that we were gonna</i>
<i>be traveling across the United States</i>

06:08.501 --> 06:09.763
<i>to play the game of basketball,</i>

06:09.869 --> 06:11.996
which, at that point,
I was starting to get a love for.

06:12.438 --> 06:14.269
<i>I remember he was real flashy.</i>

06:14.374 --> 06:17.639
<i>He came to practice,</i>
<i>he was throwing no-Iook passes.</i>

06:19.412 --> 06:21.676
<i>He and his mom</i>
<i>had some tough early years,</i>

06:21.781 --> 06:25.273
<i>and when I met him,</i>
<i>you would never know that about him.</i>

06:27.186 --> 06:29.347
<i>I'm seeing Dru come out of church school</i>
<i>this one day,</i>

06:29.455 --> 06:32.356
<i>and I'm thinking, "Hey, this is a big kid."</i>

06:32.458 --> 06:35.916
<i>He came to my dad and wanted to know</i>
<i>if I would play for his AAU team</i>

06:36.028 --> 06:37.427
that he was starting up.

06:38.364 --> 06:42.858
<i>My dad was real good. Everywhere we'd go,</i>
<i>people would know him around Akron.</i>

06:42.969 --> 06:45.665
<i>I kind of set out to be better than him.</i>

06:46.305 --> 06:49.968
<i>Sian wasn't very good.</i>
<i>He was big, but he wasn't very good.</i>

06:50.276 --> 06:52.676
<i>He was definitely the biggest kid</i>
<i>on our team,</i>

06:52.779 --> 06:55.247
<i>so we had to use him for something.</i>

06:56.749 --> 06:58.376
<i>Willie was the best player in the city,</i>

06:58.484 --> 07:01.044
<i>and we wanted him to be a part of our team.</i>

07:01.154 --> 07:03.714
<i>Coach Dru called</i>
<i>and asked my brother how my grades were</i>

07:03.823 --> 07:07.657
and things like that,
and if I considered playing on his team.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.696
<i>I remember Willie being real shy.</i>
<i>He didn't really say too much.</i>

07:11.931 --> 07:16.527
<i>He had some different life experiences</i>
<i>that maybe grown him up a little bit more.</i>

07:16.636 --> 07:19.935
<i>He was just a little bit more mature</i>
<i>than the other guys.</i>

07:20.039 --> 07:22.633
<i>He was like the grandfather of it all.</i>

07:25.912 --> 07:27.174
<i>We just started traveling.</i>

07:27.280 --> 07:30.010
We started playing different tournaments
throughout Ohio.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.516
Some of the close states.
Ohio, West Virginia.

07:42.662 --> 07:46.530
<i>We had a natural feel for each other.</i>
<i>I'm not sure what it was.</i>

07:46.632 --> 07:50.932
<i>I guess it was just meant to be,</i>
<i>but we had a chemistry for each other.</i>

07:55.842 --> 07:59.778
<i>Got to the point where we were winning</i>
<i>pretty much all the time.</i>

08:02.482 --> 08:06.179
<i>It was basketball,</i>
<i>but it was more friendship than anything.</i>

08:07.787 --> 08:11.314
<i>We were all kind of, like, strangers,</i>
<i>and we really bonded.</i>

08:12.458 --> 08:16.417
<i>I wanted to finally have some brothers</i>
<i>that I could be loyal to and be trustworthy,</i>

08:16.529 --> 08:19.089
and I think we all kind of shared that bond.

08:19.198 --> 08:21.359
<i>I actually remember being over</i>
<i>at LeBron's house one night,</i>

08:21.467 --> 08:22.491
<i>and he was just talking, like,</i>

08:22.602 --> 08:24.433
<i>"You and I are good friends,</i>
<i>you know what I'm saying?"</i>

08:24.537 --> 08:27.165
It was weird for me,
for somebody to express themselves to me,

08:27.273 --> 08:30.902
including another dude, another boy,
to me like that, you know what I mean?

08:31.010 --> 08:33.534
<i>Like, they were more giving.</i>
<i>They were more accepting.</i>

08:33.645 --> 08:35.807
<i>It just got more comfortable.</i>

08:36.616 --> 08:39.380
<i>The Fab 4, that was like our identity.</i>

08:41.087 --> 08:44.215
<i>We spent the night at each other's houses</i>
<i>every weekend.</i>

08:44.323 --> 08:47.690
<i>I'd look down in the rec room</i>
<i>and there would be just bodies down there.</i>

08:47.793 --> 08:49.693
<i>I wouldn't know who was in there.</i>

08:49.962 --> 08:54.661
<i>It was like the team was like a family.</i>
<i>You play your heart out for your family.</i>

08:56.302 --> 08:58.202
<i>I just said, "You guys are gonna do</i>
<i>something special. "</i>

08:58.304 --> 09:00.932
I didn't know what I meant by that,
but that's what...

09:01.040 --> 09:02.632
I remember telling them that.

09:04.744 --> 09:08.305
<i>And from there it became my dream</i>
<i>and their dreams</i>

09:08.414 --> 09:10.712
<i>to win a national championship.</i>

09:12.785 --> 09:15.413
<i>The AAU is the Amateur Athletic Union,</i>

09:15.521 --> 09:19.048
and they host national championships
for each age group,

09:19.158 --> 09:21.956
kind of like the NCAA championships.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.155
That's the one you want to go to
and where the best players and teams are.

09:25.631 --> 09:27.929
<i>Financially, we had no sponsors.</i>

09:28.334 --> 09:30.427
You name the fundraiser
and we probably tried it.

09:30.536 --> 09:33.403
We sold Katydids. We did fish fries.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.503
<i>We sold duct tape for a number of years.</i>

09:36.609 --> 09:40.568
Hey, don't laugh. Duct tape.
We made a lot of money selling duct tape.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.772
<i>We were kids who were on the corner</i>
<i>hustling for uniforms,</i>

09:43.883 --> 09:46.875
washing cars
and going around from door to door.

09:46.986 --> 09:50.478
The big moneymaker
was really right by the liquor store.

09:55.361 --> 09:57.420
<i>We rode in a minivan</i>
<i>from Akron, Ohio, to Florida.</i>

09:57.530 --> 09:59.760
<i>Probably, like, nine of us in a minivan.</i>

09:59.865 --> 10:04.632
<i>We went down in caravans.</i>
<i>I drove my wife's van, she drove my car,</i>

10:04.971 --> 10:08.668
<i>and I had five boys in my car</i>
<i>and she had our other three children.</i>

10:08.774 --> 10:10.503
- LeBron.
- Hello.

10:11.711 --> 10:14.680
<i>You go in, they have opening ceremonies,</i>

10:14.780 --> 10:17.647
<i>and the teams are parading through.</i>
<i>It's like the Olympics,</i>

10:17.750 --> 10:21.686
<i>and I'm like, "Wow,</i>
<i>this is more than I had ever expected. "</i>

10:22.154 --> 10:26.215
<i>Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.</i>

10:26.759 --> 10:30.320
<i>There's teams from New York,</i>
<i>from California, from Florida.</i>

10:30.429 --> 10:32.659
We were a team from Akron,
which no one ever heard of.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.966
<i>Talking to other coaches</i>
<i>and hearing that they had played 60 games,</i>

10:37.069 --> 10:38.764
"We played 50 games,"

10:38.871 --> 10:41.999
and I'm thinking,
"Wow, this doesn't look very good."

10:43.409 --> 10:45.969
<i>Today, there are over 100,000 boys</i>

10:46.078 --> 10:48.205
<i>competing in</i>
<i>AAU basketball tournaments</i>

10:48.314 --> 10:52.876
<i>across America. Are you ready?</i>

11:01.260 --> 11:04.491
<i>No one believed</i>
<i>that we would win any of the games.</i>

11:04.930 --> 11:07.160
<i>It's like we all were just clicking</i>
<i>at the right time.</i>

11:07.266 --> 11:10.758
<i>We won some big games</i>
<i>we didn't think we were gonna win.</i>

11:11.604 --> 11:12.969
<i>Everyone was like,</i>

11:13.072 --> 11:15.040
"You guys won a game?"
It was that attitude.

11:15.141 --> 11:19.874
Not like, "Great game." It's like
they couldn't believe we were still winning.

11:20.780 --> 11:26.082
<i>It's almost like our friendship off the court</i>
<i>was exactly the same as it is on the court.</i>

11:28.387 --> 11:32.687
<i>They started to believe in themselves</i>
<i>and what they could do as a team.</i>

11:35.628 --> 11:38.893
<i>In that tournament,</i>
<i>LeBron really separated himself.</i>

11:39.465 --> 11:43.401
<i>You could see he was, head and shoulders,</i>
<i>the best player there.</i>

11:46.505 --> 11:49.531
<i>We were just on a roll.</i>
<i>We got to that championship game.</i>

11:49.642 --> 11:52.372
<i>We were gonna come home</i>
<i>and say we were national champs.</i>

11:52.578 --> 11:55.706
I mean, what can you say?
We're national champions.

11:55.815 --> 11:58.079
Not knowing if we were gonna go
to high school together,

11:58.184 --> 12:00.414
<i>that definitely added a little bit more drive.</i>

12:00.519 --> 12:04.114
<i>Our dreams of winning</i>
<i>a national championship was upon us.</i>

12:05.991 --> 12:07.117
<i>In just a few moments,</i>

12:07.226 --> 12:12.163
<i>one of these teams will earn the right</i>
<i>to be called national champions!</i>

12:14.600 --> 12:18.331
<i>The place was packed.</i>
<i>Lot of camera coverage and everything.</i>

12:18.671 --> 12:21.799
When they say your name,
your heart just starts beating.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.405
<i>Dru Joyce!</i>

12:24.243 --> 12:25.471
<i>We were definitely the underdogs.</i>

12:25.578 --> 12:28.138
We were playing a team,
Southern California All-Stars.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.580
They had won fifth grade, sixth grade,
seventh grade.

12:32.818 --> 12:35.082
<i>They had two of the best players</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

12:35.187 --> 12:38.782
<i>They had one guy</i>
<i>that was in the</i> Kid's Sports Illustrated.

12:42.394 --> 12:46.490
They were talking trash like,
"Y'all from where? Y'all from Akron?

12:46.866 --> 12:48.299
<i>"All country boys."</i>

12:48.601 --> 12:53.004
They were sponsored by Nike,
had Nike shoes, Nike sweatsuits, Nike bags.

12:53.139 --> 12:55.835
Our uniforms were nice,
until we played them.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.602
Then they were terrible.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.144
When they walked into the gym,
heads turned.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.975
<i>You know,</i>
<i>they had a swagger about themselves.</i>

13:03.082 --> 13:05.915
It was kind of intimidating,
but we were just to point, like, "Forget it."

13:06.018 --> 13:07.781
You know what I'm saying?
They gotta play on the same court

13:07.887 --> 13:09.479
as we gotta play. And they gotta play.

13:10.756 --> 13:13.486
<i>Nice pass up. Bell takes up the left side,</i>
<i>goes to the basket,</i>

13:13.592 --> 13:16.925
<i>spinning pass to Washington,</i>
<i>who plays it in for two.</i>

13:17.429 --> 13:21.297
<i>Outside shot for Bell.</i>
<i>It's good for three points.</i>

13:21.400 --> 13:24.233
<i>At one point in the game,</i>
<i>it started getting ugly.</i>

13:24.336 --> 13:27.567
<i>Our kids just had a never-say-die attitude.</i>

13:29.041 --> 13:32.477
<i>In the fourth quarter,</i>
<i>we started to cut the lead down.</i>

13:32.945 --> 13:36.176
<i>James takes the ball up the side. Now look,</i>
<i>they cut the lead to three and he's about...</i>

13:36.282 --> 13:40.048
<i>What a move by James!</i>
<i>We got a three-point ballgame.</i>

13:40.886 --> 13:44.287
<i>The fans started to get into it.</i>
<i>We started feeding off of their energy.</i>

13:44.390 --> 13:49.293
<i>We made a run and still had the opportunity</i>
<i>to tie it with a two or win it with a three.</i>

13:49.461 --> 13:53.227
<i>We're just seconds away</i>
<i>from crowning the national champions.</i>

13:54.333 --> 13:56.699
<i>Ball to LeBron James,</i>
<i>gotta hurry it up the court.</i>

13:56.802 --> 13:59.566
<i>They double-team him. Shot at the buzzer!</i>

14:00.806 --> 14:02.569
<i>The whole time I'm looking at it, it's like,</i>

14:02.675 --> 14:05.803
"Okay, this is the one
I've always dreamed about.

14:05.911 --> 14:08.778
"It's about to go in. It's about to go in."

14:14.486 --> 14:19.890
<i>... AIl-Stars, 68, Shooting Stars, 66.</i>

14:20.292 --> 14:24.729
And my dreams just shattered.
And we lose by two.

14:27.466 --> 14:31.425
That was it. LeBron put his head
in his hands and that was it.

14:34.073 --> 14:38.772
<i>It was just a sick feeling, like</i>
<i>we were right there but it just slipped away.</i>

14:47.653 --> 14:49.382
<i>... high-school basketball here at Ohio.</i>

14:49.488 --> 14:51.820
<i>So good luck to all those teams</i>
<i>making their way to Columbus.</i>

14:51.924 --> 14:53.721
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>the team on everybody's watch list</i>

14:53.826 --> 14:56.351
<i>is the Fighting Irish of St. Vincent-St. Mary.</i>

14:56.462 --> 14:59.522
<i>Can LeBron James and his team</i>
<i>complete this remarkable season</i>

14:59.632 --> 15:02.032
<i>by bringing home the championship?</i>

15:13.979 --> 15:18.382
<i>We had just lost the national championship.</i>
<i>We were just so together during that time.</i>

15:18.484 --> 15:20.213
It was like,
"Man, we want to keep doing this.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.753
"We don't want to go to high school
and split up."

15:22.855 --> 15:25.847
<i>We felt like a loyalty to each other.</i>
<i>So, where one person went,</i>

15:25.958 --> 15:28.153
<i>that's where everybody else was going.</i>

15:28.260 --> 15:30.728
<i>If you were an inner-city kid,</i>
<i>you went to Buchtel.</i>

15:30.829 --> 15:34.856
<i>It was definitely an all-black school,</i>
<i>so everybody expected us to be there.</i>

15:34.967 --> 15:38.630
<i>I was on staff at Buchtel High School,</i>
<i>pre-season open gym,</i>

15:38.871 --> 15:42.238
<i>and so I'm bringing Dru around</i>
<i>and letting him play with the guys.</i>

15:42.341 --> 15:45.833
He says, "Dad, they're not gonna
give me a chance here."

15:46.345 --> 15:49.212
<i>They didn't think</i>
<i>he was big enough to play.</i>

16:04.163 --> 16:07.599
He wasn't always the biggest,
wasn't always the fastest.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.533
He wasn't the cutest, either. Oh, man.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.632
But he was tough as nails.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.737
<i>He definitely has a little man's complex.</i>

16:16.976 --> 16:20.503
<i>He won't let anybody pick on him.</i>
<i>He'll stand up to the biggest guy.</i>

16:20.612 --> 16:23.206
<i>He has the biggest heart in the world.</i>

16:23.482 --> 16:25.882
<i>I think, sometimes,</i>
<i>he may have been frustrated.</i>

16:25.985 --> 16:30.547
<i>He had this little pull-up bar in his room</i>
<i>and he'd sort of just hang from it,</i>

16:30.823 --> 16:34.054
<i>trying to stretch or whatever,</i>
<i>make himself taller.</i>

16:34.860 --> 16:37.385
<i>The guys were getting bigger</i>
<i>and I wasn't growing as much,</i>

16:37.496 --> 16:40.294
<i>so I had to add something else to my game.</i>

16:40.733 --> 16:46.365
We took Dru to a Sunday night clinic run by
an ex-college coach named Keith Dambrot.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.568
Well, I remember
that he was a very quiet young man

16:54.680 --> 16:58.047
that was all business,
and really had an unbelievable skill level

16:58.150 --> 17:01.415
and tremendous work ethic
for a fifth or sixth grader.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.718
Most days off, it didn't matter if we were
coming home from a game or tournament.

17:05.824 --> 17:08.622
I remember being here
on Super Bowl Sunday.

17:08.926 --> 17:10.484
I was here all the time.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.223
Keith and Dru really developed a bond,

17:12.330 --> 17:15.789
because they were both little guys
who loved basketball.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.800
<i>Every other coach would tell me,</i>

17:17.903 --> 17:19.996
<i>"You gotta grow, son.</i>
<i>You gotta get bigger. "</i>

17:20.239 --> 17:22.673
Just throwing negative stuff,
right out the gate.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.505
<i>He realized</i>
<i>that I really didn't care much about size.</i>

17:25.611 --> 17:28.478
<i>I just was gonna put him in a position</i>
<i>to be successful.</i>

17:28.580 --> 17:31.208
<i>Keith was now</i>
<i>a high-school basketball coach.</i>

17:31.316 --> 17:32.476
<i>So Dru says to me,</i>

17:32.584 --> 17:35.109
<i>"Dad, I'm not going to Buchtel.</i>
<i>I'm gonna go to St. V. "</i>

17:35.220 --> 17:38.917
And I remember saying to him,
"I'm on the coaching staff.

17:39.324 --> 17:41.315
"Everything's in place. What do you mean?"

17:41.427 --> 17:45.090
He said, "Dad, I know Coach Dambrot
will give me a chance."

17:48.700 --> 17:50.725
<i>Choosing to go to St. V
was definitely bigger</i>

17:50.836 --> 17:53.066
<i>than just picking one high school</i>
<i>over another.</i>

17:53.172 --> 17:55.834
<i>People look at you</i>
<i>like you was choosing race.</i>

17:55.941 --> 18:00.173
The African-American community
wanted us to bring our talents to Buchtel

18:00.279 --> 18:02.747
and felt like we were traitors.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.241
<i>The comment made was,</i>

18:04.349 --> 18:07.284
"Hey, Dru, I understand
you're pimping for St. V now."

18:08.420 --> 18:11.947
<i>Well, even if our own community</i>
<i>looked down on us, it didn't matter.</i>

18:12.057 --> 18:14.184
<i>It was worth it for our friend.</i>

18:14.293 --> 18:16.818
<i>St. Vincent-St. Mary just happened</i>
<i>to be down the street</i>

18:16.929 --> 18:21.593
from where all this stuff started
at The Salvation Army, all on Maple Street.

18:23.135 --> 18:26.229
<i>Coach Dambrot then asked Coach Cotton</i>
<i>and I to be a part of the staff</i>

18:26.338 --> 18:27.930
<i>because we had done a great job</i>
<i>with the kids.</i>

18:28.040 --> 18:31.498
<i>I mean, they were ready to play</i>
<i>high-school basketball.</i>

18:39.151 --> 18:43.554
<i>- Our team was ran like a college.</i>
<i>- He was on us from stretching.</i>

18:43.655 --> 18:46.419
<i>Like, if you wasn't stretching hard</i>
<i>or you wasn't stretching the right way,</i>

18:46.525 --> 18:47.822
<i>he'd be on us.</i>

18:47.926 --> 18:52.659
"Get your... Get this... Do this...
Who the hell you think you guys are?

18:52.764 --> 18:54.197
<i>"You freshmens."</i>

18:54.299 --> 18:56.529
I'm looking at him, like,
"Yo, I'm from the hood.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.536
"I'm about to do something to you,
like, after practice."

19:00.005 --> 19:02.906
<i>I was very difficult at times</i>
<i>but I had a purpose behind it,</i>

19:03.008 --> 19:05.943
<i>and, I think, in the long run,</i>
<i>it proved to be a good thing.</i>

19:06.044 --> 19:08.569
<i>We never knew how to play basketball</i>

19:08.914 --> 19:11.815
<i>at a high level like that</i>
<i>until Coach Dambrot.</i>

19:11.917 --> 19:14.044
<i>He's putting the best players on the court.</i>

19:14.153 --> 19:16.621
<i>If you don't got it, you don't got it.</i>
<i>He's not playing you.</i>

19:16.722 --> 19:19.190
<i>It don't matter if you're a senior.</i>

19:23.128 --> 19:26.120
We have a lot of young kids.
We have four freshmen in our top nine.

19:30.936 --> 19:33.962
They totally hit the ground running,
and they instantly had a chemistry,

19:34.072 --> 19:36.006
and they started blowing teams out.

19:36.108 --> 19:39.976
You could see the cohesiveness
that takes teams time to develop that.

19:40.078 --> 19:42.069
They had it as soon as they were freshmen.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.082
Every time we go out on the floor,
we want to play 110%,

19:45.184 --> 19:46.151
and that's what we did tonight.

19:51.356 --> 19:55.053
<i>Five games in, 5 and 0, 15-0, 20-0,</i>

19:55.694 --> 19:57.958
and the buzz is clicking.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.793
<i>The Eagles fall from the ranks</i>
<i>of the unbeaten</i>

20:01.900 --> 20:03.458
<i>while the Irish roll on.</i>

20:03.569 --> 20:05.935
<i>St. V proves worthy of that top ranking.</i>

20:06.038 --> 20:07.938
We just established who was the best.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.007
It's kind of cool, I think,

20:09.107 --> 20:12.338
"Hey, guys, I think we made
the right decision to go to St. V."

20:12.444 --> 20:14.742
That's what we were saying.
"I think we made the right decision."

20:14.846 --> 20:18.976
<i>These are young kids, 14 and 15 years old,</i>
<i>and they went 27 and 0.</i>

20:21.053 --> 20:23.749
<i>All season long,</i>
<i>when we go out for warm-ups,</i>

20:23.855 --> 20:29.259
you would hear the other teams
laugh at him and call him the mascot.

20:29.661 --> 20:32.528
<i>Dru, at the time, was 4'10" on a good day.</i>

20:32.898 --> 20:33.865
Come on, man, this guy...

20:33.966 --> 20:36.560
They looking at this dude like,
"He's not gonna play."

20:37.436 --> 20:40.928
<i>Lot of guys around Akron,</i>
<i>they felt like he got what he got</i>

20:41.039 --> 20:43.007
<i>'cause Coach Dru was the coach.</i>

20:43.108 --> 20:47.807
I was very hard on him,
and it hurt our relationship.

20:49.948 --> 20:54.180
<i>For a long time it wasn't father-son.</i>
<i>It was coach-player.</i>

20:55.721 --> 21:00.124
<i>Sometimes he could break me down</i>
<i>in a game and I couldn't get through it.</i>

21:03.428 --> 21:06.226
<i>Sometimes I had to mediate</i>
<i>between the two.</i>

21:06.365 --> 21:08.833
Dru did feel it was hard to live up

21:09.268 --> 21:12.726
to the standards that his dad had set.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.971
<i>Maybe I went overboard.</i>

21:16.208 --> 21:20.474
I had enough sense one time to ask Dru
if I was being too hard on him,

21:21.713 --> 21:23.180
and he told me, "Yes."

21:23.282 --> 21:28.310
My dad had me in the gym getting up shots,
watching tapes and watching games,

21:28.420 --> 21:32.322
<i>watch how he shoots the ball,</i>
<i>watch his arc he puts on the ball.</i>

21:32.758 --> 21:36.159
<i>I wanted everyone to understand</i>
<i>that what Dru got</i>

21:36.862 --> 21:41.060
<i>he got because he earned.</i>
<i>But it was hard. It was hard on both of us.</i>

21:41.533 --> 21:46.163
<i>Definitely harder on him because,</i>
<i>as a child, you want to please your parents,</i>

21:46.271 --> 21:49.604
<i>and I'm sure he questioned,</i>
<i>"Do I do anything right?"</i>

21:55.781 --> 21:57.180
<i>Coming up here on ONN,</i>

21:57.282 --> 21:59.648
<i>we have the Division III</i>
<i>State Boy's Basketball Finals.</i>

21:59.751 --> 22:03.551
<i>As Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary</i>
<i>battles Jamestown Greeneview.</i>

22:03.922 --> 22:08.825
<i>They're freshmen. At this level, the crowds,</i>
<i>the pressure is going to get to them.</i>

22:09.661 --> 22:12.687
<i>He's the glue, he's the point guard,</i>
<i>he's the one to make this team go.</i>

22:15.400 --> 22:16.958
<i>And they've done a nice job</i>
<i>right here hustling.</i>

22:17.102 --> 22:21.004
<i>Matthews slices into the lane.</i>
<i>And a foul called on Matthews.</i>

22:22.341 --> 22:26.300
<i>But so far Greeneview's done a nice job</i>
<i>of controlling the pace of this game.</i>

22:26.411 --> 22:28.470
<i>To call Dru Joyce,</i>
<i>who's checking into the game,</i>

22:28.580 --> 22:30.775
<i>diminutive would be a vast understatement.</i>

22:30.882 --> 22:33.749
<i>He came into the game,</i>
<i>and the fans were laughing at him.</i>

22:33.852 --> 22:35.683
They thought the ball boy checked in.

22:35.787 --> 22:38.278
His shorts were so big
they looked like sweat pants.

22:38.390 --> 22:41.188
<i>He is generously listed at 5'2",</i>

22:41.927 --> 22:46.660
<i>but I think everyone's under the general</i>
<i>consensus that he may be about 4'11".</i>

22:47.199 --> 22:49.292
<i>Greeneview by three, 11 to 8.</i>

22:52.537 --> 22:56.473
<i>We almost couldn't see him shooting,</i>
<i>and he stuck it to tie the game at 11.</i>

23:00.946 --> 23:03.039
<i>Throws it to Dru Joyce.</i>

23:03.148 --> 23:06.049
<i>Dru Joyce gets open deep in the corner,</i>
<i>and he does it again!</i>

23:06.651 --> 23:09.119
Then when he made the third one,
I didn't want to say anything.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.247
I just wanted to allow this thing to play out.

23:12.491 --> 23:17.053
<i>... and this looks like the Irish</i>
<i>just want to pass it around the outside.</i>

23:18.530 --> 23:20.691
<i>He didn't want anybody to say anything</i>
<i>about his size</i>

23:20.799 --> 23:24.257
<i>because he felt he could go with anybody,</i>
<i>no matter their size.</i>

23:24.369 --> 23:26.769
He'd just do it a different way.

23:28.106 --> 23:30.233
<i>That's where the good guys' point guard...</i>

23:30.342 --> 23:32.435
<i>Dru Joyce!</i>

23:32.544 --> 23:37.038
<i>This tie-breaker. Division III</i>
<i>championship record. Six for six.</i>

23:40.419 --> 23:42.353
<i>Six for six, Dru Joyce.</i>

23:43.789 --> 23:47.691
<i>He has 18 points in six minutes of playtime.</i>

23:47.793 --> 23:50.353
<i>Dru Joyce. There it is.</i>

23:51.496 --> 23:55.091
<i>Twenty-one points for Dru Joyce</i>
<i>at the end of the third period.</i>

23:55.200 --> 23:59.296
<i>St. Vincent-St. Mary, a quarter away</i>
<i>from the state championship.</i>

23:59.604 --> 24:01.128
<i>It was a transcendent moment.</i>

24:01.239 --> 24:04.936
<i>It was a moment that most people there</i>
<i>will always remember.</i>

24:07.579 --> 24:10.343
There was a little man on his shoulder
that he knocked off that game.

24:13.351 --> 24:16.582
<i>I think it's the size of that man's heart</i>
<i>and the size of that man's brain</i>

24:16.688 --> 24:19.748
<i>that determines who can play</i>
<i>and who can't play.</i>

24:33.138 --> 24:35.538
<i>Going to the sophomore year</i>
<i>we were playing some tougher teams,</i>

24:35.640 --> 24:37.631
<i>so we needed to be better.</i>

24:40.812 --> 24:43.804
<i>I never thought basketball</i>
<i>was gonna be my future.</i>

24:43.915 --> 24:47.976
I just wanted to play it
just because it gets you girls.

24:48.954 --> 24:50.581
<i>Rome transferred in.</i>

24:50.689 --> 24:54.250
He was cool. He was...
No, Rome wasn't cool.

24:55.260 --> 24:58.525
He was funny, but he was so selfish.

24:58.797 --> 25:02.563
<i>I mean, we looked out for each other.</i>
<i>Rome, no sense of that.</i>

25:02.868 --> 25:07.805
They were like sisters, like little girls.
Always giggling and it was touchy feely.

25:07.906 --> 25:12.434
<i>You know, and always sharing,</i>
<i>and I'm not the sharing, caring, loving type.</i>

25:13.211 --> 25:15.805
<i>He called himself angry man.</i>
<i>He'd be like... Somebody had on a hat</i>

25:15.914 --> 25:20.351
and they'll walk down the hall, and he'd
be like, "Hey! That hat is dumb as hell."

25:20.452 --> 25:23.944
You know, something like that.
For no reason, no good reason.

25:24.055 --> 25:28.549
It was like, "Man, why is you... You wake up
angry, like, what is you mad for, like?

25:28.660 --> 25:32.687
"Who did something to you today?"
I mean, he just had an attitude.

25:33.098 --> 25:36.727
<i>Sian was always talking on the court,</i>
<i>you know, playing dirty. I never liked him,</i>

25:36.835 --> 25:42.330
and Dru raked my eyes out like some
wrestling type, like, ripped my eyeball out.

25:42.707 --> 25:45.198
I hit him in the eye. He was crying.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.938
I punched him in the face and Dru,
he's just a little off, he's like,

25:49.047 --> 25:52.744
"Yeah, yeah, hit me again. Hit me again.
I like it, I like it."

25:55.620 --> 25:58.111
<i>The St. Vincent-St. Mary</i>
<i>Irish basketball team</i>

25:58.223 --> 26:02.660
finished the season a perfect 27 and 0
in the Division III State Champion.

26:02.761 --> 26:05.559
So let's tip it off
with their crowning moment as we honor...

26:05.664 --> 26:07.996
- This year's to beat, St. V!
- This year's to beat, St. V!

26:08.099 --> 26:10.192
People saw such high expectations

26:10.302 --> 26:12.827
because we had won the previous year.
We had won state.

26:12.938 --> 26:15.133
It was a team that was young,
and people said,

26:15.240 --> 26:17.299
"This could happen for the next two
or three years."

26:21.513 --> 26:25.643
We were starting to get some national
ranking and people were starting to say,

26:25.750 --> 26:28.275
"What's going on over here
in Akron, Ohio?"

26:30.388 --> 26:34.256
<i>We weren't winning by eight or 10 or 12.</i>
<i>We were winning by 20.</i>

26:37.128 --> 26:39.596
<i>You could see</i>
<i>the whole LeBron phenomena</i>

26:39.698 --> 26:42.929
<i>and then the team phenomena grow</i>
<i>and grow and grow.</i>

26:47.105 --> 26:50.074
<i>James with a steal, clocks it,</i>
<i>and finishes with a flourish.</i>

26:50.408 --> 26:52.433
<i>Since we were winning, you know,</i>
<i>it really didn't matter</i>

26:52.544 --> 26:55.138
<i>that Rome had an attitude sometimes</i>

26:55.246 --> 26:58.579
<i>or he didn't want to do</i>
<i>what we needed him to do sometimes.</i>

26:58.683 --> 27:01.675
<i>He's playing well, we playing good,</i>
<i>and he's just trying to make it through it,</i>

27:01.786 --> 27:05.722
instead of gaining friends and
doing it for each other, not just for him.

27:10.261 --> 27:13.196
<i>You know, when you're winning,</i>
<i>you don't see as much as you would see</i>

27:13.298 --> 27:16.461
<i>if you were losing.</i>
<i>So, Romeo not being as tight as us four,</i>

27:16.568 --> 27:19.537
you know, it wasn't so microscopic,
if we were losing.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.232
<i>Akron's St. Vincent-St. Mary</i>
<i>has done it again.</i>

27:22.340 --> 27:24.069
<i>But we were winning.</i>

27:29.247 --> 27:30.976
<i>I didn't care if I was part of the group.</i>

27:31.082 --> 27:32.777
<i>We were playing good ball</i>
<i>and we were winning.</i>

27:32.884 --> 27:36.376
That's all I cared about.
I figured I'd do my own thing.

27:36.988 --> 27:41.425
We definitely reached our goal for that year,
but it also opened our eyes up, like,

27:41.526 --> 27:43.994
at the end of freshman year,
we could do so much more.

27:44.729 --> 27:46.856
<i>Our goals had become bigger,</i>

27:47.532 --> 27:50.763
<i>and we can carry this</i>
<i>to the national championship.</i>

28:07.752 --> 28:11.779
Listen, fellas, hey, big day. It's the big day.

28:12.557 --> 28:15.185
All right? We're better than this team.

28:15.293 --> 28:18.262
They haven't played anywhere near
the competition we played.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.127
But I'm gonna tell you,
they're gonna play hard, fellas.

28:21.232 --> 28:26.101
So if you're not ready to play hard,
let me know now. Come on, let's bring it in.

28:27.906 --> 28:29.032
- One, two, three.
- Team.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.199
- Four, five, six.
- Work hard!

28:34.379 --> 28:39.009
<i>Coach Dambrot and the Fighting Irish</i>
<i>from St. Vincent-St. Mary High School,</i>

28:39.117 --> 28:41.711
<i>what an outstanding season you've had.</i>

28:46.858 --> 28:50.885
<i>Him leaving at that time, you know,</i>
<i>really hurt our morale.</i>

28:51.529 --> 28:53.690
I didn't care
about his personal reasons at all.

28:54.766 --> 28:59.226
<i>I knew what he had said to me, that</i>
<i>he was gonna be there for the four years,</i>

28:59.337 --> 29:04.502
and that's all that came in my mind, like,
"Man, you lied." You know what I mean?

29:04.909 --> 29:09.039
And I played hard for him.
He cursed me out and treated me bad,

29:09.814 --> 29:12.578
<i>but I felt like he was one of</i>
<i>the best coaches that I had ever played for,</i>

29:12.684 --> 29:17.644
<i>and seeing him go, I couldn't understand it.</i>
<i>I never wanted to talk to him again.</i>

29:19.390 --> 29:21.381
<i>It was one of the hardest decisions</i>
<i>I ever made,</i>

29:21.493 --> 29:23.222
<i>because I wouldn't even</i>
<i>have that opportunity</i>

29:23.328 --> 29:28.288
if it wasn't for the players on that team.
Those guys had resurrected my career.

29:30.935 --> 29:35.599
<i>You know, Keith calls me</i>
<i>and tells me that he wanted me to take over.</i>

29:36.741 --> 29:40.040
My first response, honestly, was no.
I didn't want to do it.

29:40.145 --> 29:42.943
I just felt like,
"I don't want to mess this thing up.

29:43.047 --> 29:44.912
"These kids have so much going for them."

29:45.016 --> 29:47.484
We had upgraded the schedule till it was...

29:47.585 --> 29:50.782
We were playing nationally-ranked teams.
We had them all coming into Akron.

29:50.889 --> 29:53.084
We're moving into Division II.

29:53.258 --> 29:56.250
There were just so many challenges,
and for me to be a first-year coach,

29:56.361 --> 29:58.795
I just felt like I didn't want to mess it up.

29:58.897 --> 30:03.197
And I can remember sharing that
with my wife,

30:07.338 --> 30:10.364
and she said to me, she said,
"Dru, how can you say no?

30:15.146 --> 30:19.446
<i>"This is honoring all those years</i>
<i>that you put in with these kids.</i>

30:19.551 --> 30:21.143
<i>"How can you possibly say no?"</i>

30:21.252 --> 30:24.085
And those words
were what I needed to hear.

30:26.724 --> 30:30.751
<i>I grew up in some very humble beginnings.</i>
<i>My father was a janitor,</i>

30:31.029 --> 30:33.554
<i>and my mother cleaned</i>
<i>wealthy families' homes.</i>

30:33.665 --> 30:37.999
<i>She was what they called a day worker.</i>
<i>But my mother was just adamant.</i>

30:38.102 --> 30:42.835
<i>I mean, going to college for me</i>
<i>was almost like going to high school.</i>

30:43.241 --> 30:46.733
It was never, "Am I going, am I not?"
It was, "You're going."

30:47.979 --> 30:49.844
<i>I wasn't really trying</i>
<i>to climb the corporate ladder,</i>

30:49.948 --> 30:53.941
<i>but as the kids started to come</i>
<i>and the responsibilities started to grow,</i>

30:54.052 --> 30:56.043
<i>the focus was,</i>
<i>"Hey, we need to make a little more money,</i>

30:56.154 --> 30:59.453
<i>"and, yeah,</i>
<i>I'm having a lot of good success at work,</i>

30:59.624 --> 31:04.220
<i>"winning a lot of prizes, a lot of trips."</i>
<i>I was very appreciative of it.</i>

31:04.662 --> 31:08.154
But at the end of the day
I would ask myself,

31:08.266 --> 31:10.928
"What have I done that really matters?"

31:12.604 --> 31:15.630
Let us pray.
Dearly, Father Lord, we thank you

31:15.740 --> 31:18.300
for all the blessings
you've bestowed upon us.

31:18.409 --> 31:22.869
Lord, we understand that basketball
is very small in the scheme of things,

31:23.147 --> 31:28.483
but we recognize there's a lot of people
who'd like to be right here where we are.

31:29.020 --> 31:30.988
But you have blessed us
with this opportunity,

31:31.089 --> 31:33.557
and we want to make the most of it,

31:34.525 --> 31:37.426
not for our own glory but for your glory.

31:37.595 --> 31:39.187
Pray these things
in your son Jesus' name. Amen.

31:39.297 --> 31:40.264
- Amen.
- Amen.

31:40.365 --> 31:41.491
- Team up.
- Team, on the count of six.

31:41.599 --> 31:42.588
- One, two, three.
- Team.

31:42.700 --> 31:43.792
- Four, five, six.
- Work hard.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.597
Superman, let's go.

31:47.138 --> 31:50.130
<i>I took over understanding that if we won,</i>

31:50.241 --> 31:54.837
<i>they were gonna be Keith's kids,</i>
<i>and if we lost, it would be my fault, so...</i>

31:57.248 --> 32:00.809
<i>A doors open for your dream,</i>
<i>you don't think about anything else.</i>

32:00.919 --> 32:02.784
<i>You just run through the door</i>

32:02.887 --> 32:06.482
and try to do the best job
that I was gonna be able to do.

32:07.759 --> 32:11.024
<i>St. Vincent-St. Mary will be playing</i>
<i>a national schedule this year</i>

32:11.129 --> 32:13.495
<i>with an opportunity to win</i>
<i>a national championship.</i>

32:13.598 --> 32:16.032
<i>A lot of pressure, though,</i>
<i>on Coach Dru Joyce</i>

32:16.134 --> 32:19.570
<i>to make sure they have the same success</i>
<i>as the previous two years.</i>

32:19.671 --> 32:22.538
That's one team you gotta buy a ticket
to go see, St. V's.

32:22.640 --> 32:26.007
We definitely felt like, you know,
it was our turn.

32:26.511 --> 32:28.877
<i>I was starting to become a man</i>
<i>in my junior year.</i>

32:28.980 --> 32:31.210
<i>I was 16, about to turn 17, so...</i>

32:32.150 --> 32:33.549
It was like, "Whatever, let's get down."

32:46.431 --> 32:51.459
We're playing these highly-ranked teams
in the country and we're winning 100 to 50.

32:51.569 --> 32:54.663
<i>And the Irish blew away the Bulldogs</i>
<i>76 to 36.</i>

32:55.807 --> 32:57.274
Eighty to 35.

32:57.375 --> 33:00.776
<i>St. Vincent-St. Mary's dominate again,</i>
<i>78- 49.</i>

33:04.749 --> 33:09.345
I kept hearing about this player
Carmelo Anthony and I'm like, "Whatever."

33:13.057 --> 33:15.890
Country, stateside, city-side,
it was bananas.

33:15.994 --> 33:19.691
It was like we felt invincible.
We was, like, untouchables.

33:20.064 --> 33:24.694
<i>Travis from LeBron James.</i>
<i>Travis from James.</i>

33:24.802 --> 33:29.171
They seemed to never let anybody down.
They really were defending all the hype.

33:29.273 --> 33:31.138
After a while you started saying,

33:31.242 --> 33:35.736
"Wow, is this one of the greatest teams
in high-school basketball history?"

33:42.587 --> 33:44.817
First time I saw LeBron play was in Akron,

33:44.922 --> 33:49.052
and I think that the tendency, especially
when you're a skeptical sports writer,

33:49.160 --> 33:51.856
is to try and nitpick and say to yourself,

33:51.963 --> 33:55.399
"This kid isn't as good
as everyone says he is."

33:56.968 --> 33:58.959
And yet, he was that good.

34:01.739 --> 34:04.867
<i>And so I pitched the story</i>
<i>to</i> Sports Illustrated.

34:07.779 --> 34:11.237
<i>He's been dubbed the chosen one.</i>
<i>According to</i> Sports Illustrated,

34:11.349 --> 34:16.217
<i>LeBron is the first high-school athlete</i>
<i>to grace the magazine's cover in 36 years.</i>

34:16.320 --> 34:19.551
<i>Nobody from Akron had ever been</i>
<i>on the cover of</i> Sports Illustrated <i>before.</i>

34:19.657 --> 34:22.353
<i>You've got kids from Texas</i>
<i>and New York City</i>

34:22.460 --> 34:24.792
<i>reading about this kid from Akron, Ohio.</i>

34:24.896 --> 34:26.761
<i>The Ohio, national and world media</i>

34:26.864 --> 34:29.161
<i>have been following</i>
<i>the St. Vincent-St. Mary star</i>

34:29.266 --> 34:30.632
<i>all season long.</i>

34:30.735 --> 34:37.607
Once the <i>Sports Illustrated</i> thing goes on,
everything was just amplified.

34:43.714 --> 34:47.150
<i>Today's ESPN, Internet generation,</i>

34:47.385 --> 34:50.946
<i>what happens in one small corner</i>
<i>of the country or the world</i>

34:51.054 --> 34:52.579
<i>can be worldwide.</i>

34:52.690 --> 34:56.251
<i>And these kids were right at the forefront</i>
<i>of it, so when they went someplace,</i>

34:56.360 --> 34:57.725
<i>people knew them by name.</i>

34:57.829 --> 35:01.230
LeBron James has his own T-shirt
that you can buy here at the game today.

35:01.332 --> 35:05.860
<i>You have to go back, I think,</i>
<i>to Lew Alcindor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar now,</i>

35:05.970 --> 35:11.033
<i>who got that kind of attention as a high</i>
<i>school player before their senior season.</i>

35:11.409 --> 35:13.741
<i>But when you have to go back that far,</i>

35:13.845 --> 35:16.837
you realize how rare it is,
what LeBron was doing.

35:16.948 --> 35:20.076
They moved all their high-school games
over to the University of Akron

35:20.184 --> 35:24.348
just for sheer seating purposes, and even
there, some of the higher-profile games,

35:24.455 --> 35:25.979
the 5,000 seats weren't enough.

35:26.090 --> 35:28.684
<i>The Cavs/Gund Arena has only sold out</i>
<i>twice this year.</i>

35:28.793 --> 35:33.162
<i>Once when Michael Jordan came to town,</i>
<i>and the other was to see this guy.</i>

35:33.264 --> 35:37.928
<i>LeBron James, and a 30-point win</i>
<i>sends the Irish to the regional semifinals.</i>

35:38.336 --> 35:41.169
<i>LeBron James!</i>

35:41.739 --> 35:43.639
<i>It was almost like playing in the NBA.</i>

35:43.741 --> 35:47.233
<i>People at our hotels,</i>
<i>girls trying to get up to the room.</i>

35:47.345 --> 35:49.870
<i>People out front scalping tickets</i>
<i>for 300 bucks</i>

35:49.981 --> 35:52.541
to see a high-school basketball game.

35:52.783 --> 35:55.217
<i>You knew that it was a phenomena</i>
<i>that you wanted to see,</i>

35:55.319 --> 35:57.344
<i>'cause you knew that you were gonna</i>
<i>be able to tell your kids,</i>

35:57.455 --> 35:59.514
<i>"I saw LeBron play when..."</i>

35:59.657 --> 36:03.753
<i>He's like the next Michael Jordan, so</i>
<i>my brother told me he had to get a picture.</i>

36:03.861 --> 36:06.125
I mean, he wasn't the only celebrity.
He was just...

36:06.230 --> 36:08.460
He had a little more star power
than the rest of us.

36:11.302 --> 36:14.703
<i>We were like a rock band.</i>
<i>He was just the lead singer.</i>

36:14.872 --> 36:16.840
We had jogging suits. We was all matching.

36:16.941 --> 36:19.705
<i>We was laced from head to toe.</i>
<i>We were sponsored by Adidas now.</i>

36:19.810 --> 36:21.801
We was rocking. We like...

36:21.946 --> 36:26.383
<i>Signing autographs everywhere we went.</i>
<i>Taking pictures, you know, kissing babies,</i>

36:26.484 --> 36:29.647
that kind of thing, so, you know,
it was all good.

36:30.221 --> 36:32.621
<i>If that wasn't bad enough,</i>
<i>300 people waiting for autographs,</i>

36:32.723 --> 36:35.692
<i>but there were guys in their uniforms</i>
<i>that had just played the game</i>

36:35.793 --> 36:37.761
<i>who wanted his autograph.</i>

36:38.029 --> 36:40.725
No autographs, gentlemen. No autographs.

36:40.932 --> 36:41.899
- LeBron.
- Come on.

36:41.999 --> 36:43.557
- LeBron.
- LeBron.

36:44.502 --> 36:47.164
- LeBron.
- LeBron.

36:47.905 --> 36:50.066
- There he is!
- LeBron!

36:50.908 --> 36:52.739
We love you, LeBron!

36:53.277 --> 36:57.236
<i>You know, for me, as a first-year coach,</i>
<i>how do you manage this?</i>

36:57.348 --> 37:00.146
<i>It was all new, so there were times that,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

37:00.251 --> 37:03.448
I wanted to go out in my backyard
and just scream.

37:03.621 --> 37:07.216
<i>He had to try to handle that circus,</i>
<i>plus keep us on track.</i>

37:07.325 --> 37:08.690
<i>With the amount of expectations,</i>

37:08.793 --> 37:10.556
<i>the amount of people</i>
<i>that were going to the game,</i>

37:10.661 --> 37:11.753
<i>the teams we were playing,</i>

37:11.862 --> 37:15.161
<i>they were drawing more than we were</i>
<i>at the universities.</i>

37:15.266 --> 37:17.063
<i>We'd be sitting in the athletic office</i>

37:17.168 --> 37:21.002
and the answering machine would come on
and it would be <i>The Letterman Show.</i>

37:21.105 --> 37:23.903
We'd all look at each other like,
"Oh, my, God."

37:24.008 --> 37:27.774
You know, we were like...
It turned adults into kids.

37:28.346 --> 37:32.442
<i>When someone has a tremendous amount</i>
<i>of talent at such a young age,</i>

37:32.717 --> 37:36.847
<i>we go nuts for it in the United States.</i>
<i>More so, I think, than in other countries.</i>

37:36.954 --> 37:38.854
<i>As a journalist, you do think about</i>

37:38.956 --> 37:42.187
<i>what it's gonna do to somebody's life</i>
<i>when someone that young,</i>

37:42.293 --> 37:46.662
<i>who hasn't really done anything yet,</i>
<i>is put on the cover of the magazine.</i>

37:46.764 --> 37:49.460
<i>How do you tell 16, 17- year-old kids,</i>
<i>"Don't let it get to your head,</i>

37:49.567 --> 37:53.367
"but there's about 300 kids out there
waiting for autographs"?

37:58.843 --> 38:02.301
We definitely had a swagger about us,
and we had a strong swagger.

38:10.855 --> 38:13.380
<i>Can you talk about your relationship</i>
<i>with LeBron James?</i>

38:13.491 --> 38:16.153
I've seen him play. He's very talented.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.501
<i>Ultimately, what it comes down to</i>
<i>is the belief in yourself.</i>

38:26.604 --> 38:28.367
If he has that, he'll be fine.

38:33.511 --> 38:35.809
LeBron can do some damage
on the next level, too.

38:41.385 --> 38:43.945
Damn. Shoots off for another landing.

38:44.755 --> 38:47.315
One more time. Go slow one more time.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.149
One more time.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.990
You get that invincibility trait
where you think that,

38:52.096 --> 38:55.293
"Hey, it doesn't matter.
I can turn it on and off whenever I want."

38:55.399 --> 38:57.492
One thing that you need to be a champion

38:57.601 --> 39:02.038
that all the greats have done
throughout the years, eat Wheaties.

39:03.541 --> 39:07.204
Eat Wheaties. Right? Right?
That's all you gotta do, right?

39:07.311 --> 39:11.077
When you've coached a group of guys
from the time they were 10,

39:11.182 --> 39:14.379
<i>sometimes, you know, you get to a point</i>
<i>where they stop listening to you,</i>

39:14.485 --> 39:15.645
<i>they stop hearing you.</i>

39:15.753 --> 39:18.221
How is that not a part of the play?

39:18.689 --> 39:22.955
Sian was right here, the ball was here.
We're gonna spread the play. Go.

39:23.594 --> 39:25.789
- Even if we don't, Dru'll set it up.
- Go!

39:26.497 --> 39:29.557
I could see some problems coming
that could lead to disaster,

39:29.667 --> 39:32.795
and I didn't think there was anything
Coach Dru could do about it.

39:32.903 --> 39:34.734
<i>We were winning and we were young,</i>
<i>so, you know,</i>

39:34.839 --> 39:38.502
we blew them off, like,
"Whatever, we're gonna win anyway."

39:45.916 --> 39:47.474
Partying late at night,
you know what I'm saying,

39:47.585 --> 39:49.985
<i>having people come visit at the hotel.</i>

39:50.087 --> 39:52.988
We got a game the next day,
but who cares? We still winning by 40.

39:54.325 --> 39:55.519
<i>There were people who were starting to talk</i>

39:55.626 --> 39:58.424
<i>about whether they could win</i>
<i>a national championship that year.</i>

40:00.364 --> 40:02.628
<i>The difference between a good team</i>
<i>and a great team,</i>

40:02.733 --> 40:05.167
it's the attention to the details.

40:05.503 --> 40:07.471
No one wants to talk to one another.

40:07.571 --> 40:10.904
You don't start talking,
you never gonna play for me.

40:11.275 --> 40:14.176
You'll just be a JV guy
sitting at the end of the bench.

40:14.278 --> 40:16.075
I mean, I'm just being real with you.

40:16.180 --> 40:19.149
All right? If you can't do those little things,
how can we play?

40:20.918 --> 40:24.718
<i>Off the court, you know, Romeo,</i>
<i>he was distant from everybody,</i>

40:24.955 --> 40:29.517
<i>so when it came to on the court, you know,</i>
<i>we were kind of distant from him.</i>

40:39.937 --> 40:43.873
We had it rough growing up and, you know,
you had to fend for yourself.

40:43.974 --> 40:46.238
Everything we got,
it was, like, precious to us.

40:46.343 --> 40:49.972
Saying thank you, thank you, thank you.
Through Christ I pray. Amen.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.445
- Amen.
- Amen.

40:51.715 --> 40:52.807
So I thought you...

40:52.917 --> 40:55.408
<i>Growing up was hard.</i>
<i>It was real hard, you know.</i>

40:55.519 --> 40:57.544
<i>Sometimes we didn't have nothing to eat</i>

40:57.655 --> 41:00.783
<i>and my sister would go put on</i>
<i>a big, thick winter coat,</i>

41:00.891 --> 41:02.688
<i>go steal some ingredients</i>
<i>to make some spaghetti,</i>

41:02.793 --> 41:05.956
<i>you know, just whatever we needed to do</i>
<i>to get by.</i>

41:07.198 --> 41:10.463
<i>My family moved around so much</i>
<i>it was ridiculous.</i>

41:10.568 --> 41:13.969
<i>Like, I went to maybe six</i>
<i>or seven elementary schools.</i>

41:14.905 --> 41:18.534
He wasn't able to establish
really long-term friendships

41:18.642 --> 41:20.439
maybe the way he should have.

41:20.544 --> 41:23.035
He took on an attitude,
"Each man for his self.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.273
"I have to get mine.

41:24.381 --> 41:28.750
"No one is gonna look out for me.
If I don't get it, then I won't have it."

41:28.853 --> 41:32.118
<i>He wanted to leave. They were a clique,</i>

41:32.256 --> 41:37.159
<i>and he wasn't a part of it, and it hurt</i>
<i>his feelings, and he just felt like, you know,</i>

41:37.261 --> 41:38.819
<i>why even bother?</i>

41:39.964 --> 41:44.958
<i>You know, I had known Romeo not well</i>
<i>or well enough where he could talk to me.</i>

41:45.069 --> 41:48.971
<i>But Dru, Willie and Sian</i>
<i>gave him no chance.</i>

41:49.607 --> 41:50.733
No chance at all.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.971
Why you all complaining?

41:53.077 --> 41:54.942
Hey, hey! All right.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.446
Hold on, hold on.

42:00.885 --> 42:03.877
- That will always get you in trouble.
- But I didn't do anything!

42:03.988 --> 42:06.957
- We need a police escort.
- Is you sitting down?

42:07.157 --> 42:09.990
- Sit down.
- We need a police escort, man.

42:10.094 --> 42:12.892
<i>Everything with Dru and me is intensified.</i>

42:13.664 --> 42:17.430
<i>Now we're on a national scale,</i>
<i>and I don't want any mistakes.</i>

42:17.768 --> 42:21.260
<i>If Dru had a turnover,</i>
<i>it was like he had 10 turnovers.</i>

42:22.540 --> 42:27.477
We bumped heads because, you know,
now I'm requiring perfection from him,

42:28.112 --> 42:30.478
<i>and maybe not from everyone else.</i>

42:30.681 --> 42:35.778
If you can't let it go, then let me know it
and then I'm not going to play you.

42:37.087 --> 42:39.487
I just told you, I don't have an attitude.

42:39.590 --> 42:41.785
- Why don't you listen?
- Really.

42:43.460 --> 42:45.189
Point guard, leader.

42:46.063 --> 42:49.863
The only team that's gonna beat
St. Vincent-St. Mary is us,

42:49.967 --> 42:52.868
and these kind of attitudes
is what is going to beat us.

42:52.970 --> 42:58.306
<i>You just see a complacency</i>
<i>that's creeping in because of the status.</i>

42:59.043 --> 43:04.174
<i>You're being built up on this pedestal.</i>
<i>It's so easy for that thing to fall.</i>

43:08.085 --> 43:11.054
<i>We're the defending state champions,</i>
<i>you know? They gotta come beat us.</i>

43:11.155 --> 43:14.124
I'm not being cocky,
but that's just the type of player I am.

43:14.224 --> 43:17.057
I'm guaranteeing,
I'm not gonna let my team lose.

43:17.161 --> 43:19.857
I don't want my team losing,
and I know they don't want to lose,

43:19.964 --> 43:22.432
and I ain't going to let it happen.

43:24.902 --> 43:27.769
<i>A sellout crowd awaits us here</i>
<i>at the Value City Arena.</i>

43:27.871 --> 43:30.305
<i>Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary</i>
<i>will throw their high-powered offense</i>

43:30.407 --> 43:34.867
<i>up against a team that fully expected</i>
<i>to be playing in this game today.</i>

43:35.179 --> 43:38.615
<i>You guys are not ready to play.</i>
<i>You're underestimating these guys.</i>

43:38.716 --> 43:42.777
<i>You guys think you can turn it on</i>
<i>and off like a faucet, but you can't.</i>

43:42.886 --> 43:47.619
If you think this team is gonna walk out
there and let you walk away with this,

43:47.925 --> 43:51.156
you're fooling yourselves, right, fellas?
You're fooling yourselves.

43:51.261 --> 43:54.389
<i>A new head coach, Dru Joyce,</i>
<i>really stepped into a pressure-cooker job.</i>

43:54.498 --> 43:56.762
<i>It's gonna be a tough roll for St. Vincent.</i>

43:56.867 --> 44:01.429
Complacent, arrogant, selfishness,
that's not what we're about.

44:02.306 --> 44:03.898
<i>They believe in their style of play...</i>

44:04.008 --> 44:06.169
<i>We're not backing down from these guys.</i>
<i>We're not changing a thing.</i>

44:06.276 --> 44:10.372
<i>- We're going right at them.</i>
<i>- That's why I like this match-up today.</i>

44:12.316 --> 44:14.807
<i>The opening tip for Division II</i>
<i>State Championship game,</i>

44:14.918 --> 44:18.251
<i>and the opening tap was controlled</i>
<i>by Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary.</i>

44:18.355 --> 44:20.721
<i>We played them earlier that year</i>
<i>at Kent State. We blew them up.</i>

44:20.824 --> 44:23.520
You know, we're thinking,
"Hey, they can't beat us."

44:23.627 --> 44:25.185
<i>James working on Wyrick.</i>

44:25.295 --> 44:28.128
<i>Spins to the baseline,</i>
<i>leaves it inside for Travis.</i>

44:28.265 --> 44:31.257
<i>I'll tell you, this young man can pass...</i>

44:31.769 --> 44:35.762
<i>Early on, Roger Bacon, they made it</i>
<i>very clear they were a very good team,</i>

44:35.873 --> 44:37.568
<i>that it wasn't going to be easy.</i>

44:37.675 --> 44:40.166
<i>... the Spartans from Roger Bacon.</i>

44:40.277 --> 44:42.575
<i>And it's Beckham Wyrick put his team</i>
<i>back ahead by a point.</i>

44:42.680 --> 44:44.614
<i>They go up and down the floor here</i>
<i>in the first quarter.</i>

44:45.082 --> 44:47.516
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Pick it up!

44:48.052 --> 44:49.519
<i>We struggled early.</i>

44:49.620 --> 44:52.612
<i>LeBron couldn't do some of the things</i>
<i>that he had done so easily.</i>

44:52.723 --> 44:54.418
<i>They played here this morning in Columbus.</i>

44:54.525 --> 44:58.052
<i>The media crush... And the fourth</i>
<i>personal foul on LeBron James</i>

44:58.395 --> 45:01.523
<i>as he spins into the lane</i>
<i>and a charge is called.</i>

45:01.999 --> 45:05.662
<i>It's just like everything happened wrong</i>
<i>at the right time.</i>

45:05.769 --> 45:08.431
<i>In this third quarter with no points...</i>

45:13.377 --> 45:15.902
<i>Able to answer the drive by James.</i>

45:16.146 --> 45:20.606
<i>Seven minutes and 10 seconds remaining</i>
<i>in the Division II State Championship game</i>

45:20.718 --> 45:22.117
<i>here in the Value City Arena in Columbus.</i>

45:22.219 --> 45:24.084
<i>Offensive rebounding a big factor.</i>

45:24.188 --> 45:27.248
<i>In this one, that's been one of the reasons</i>
<i>that Roger Bacon has...</i>

45:27.357 --> 45:30.190
<i>James can't finish it inside.</i>
<i>Took the lob from Dru,</i>

45:30.294 --> 45:33.388
<i>Dru Joyce, who can't finish,</i>
<i>and it's a five on four game right now.</i>

45:33.497 --> 45:35.362
<i>James a little slow</i>
<i>getting back down the court.</i>

45:35.466 --> 45:37.627
<i>And that's what's hurting 'em.</i>
<i>That's what's hurting 'em.</i>

45:37.735 --> 45:41.899
<i>- St. Clair from the baseline scores.</i>
<i>- You cannot sit back and watch.</i>

45:42.806 --> 45:44.865
<i>We just started unraveling.</i>

45:45.175 --> 45:47.666
<i>It's on the baseline now.</i>
<i>Wyrick got blocked from behind.</i>

45:47.778 --> 45:51.145
<i>And if that's on Romeo Travis,</i>
<i>he's just fouled out of the game.</i>

45:51.248 --> 45:53.113
<i>Travis beside himself.</i>

45:56.286 --> 45:59.414
<i>And Travis has fouled out of the game.</i>

45:59.990 --> 46:03.153
<i>We're in the back seat right now.</i>
<i>We gotta do something.</i>

46:03.260 --> 46:07.128
<i>Under a minute and a half to go,</i>
<i>LeBron James flies to the baseline and...</i>

46:07.231 --> 46:09.597
<i>Finishes with a big-time flourish.</i>

46:09.700 --> 46:11.827
<i>That was definitely big time there.</i>

46:11.935 --> 46:13.926
<i>Working on Wyrick, into the lane.</i>

46:14.037 --> 46:16.801
<i>They kick it back to Dru Joyce,</i>
<i>and it's knocked away...</i>

46:29.086 --> 46:31.680
<i>The lead stands at three</i>
<i>with 22 seconds left.</i>

46:31.789 --> 46:33.984
<i>66-63, Cincinnati Roger Bacon,</i>

46:34.091 --> 46:37.322
<i>Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary</i>
<i>with the basketball,</i>

46:37.594 --> 46:39.960
<i>with 17 seconds left in the game.</i>

46:40.230 --> 46:43.927
<i>Score and time, lower right of your screen.</i>
<i>Mraz curls up a...</i>

46:46.203 --> 46:49.070
<i>With nine seconds left and a foul is called.</i>

46:49.173 --> 46:51.232
<i>And a technical foul has now been called</i>

46:51.341 --> 46:54.310
<i>on Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary's Dru Joyce.</i>

46:54.645 --> 46:57.808
<i>The player, Dru Joyce,</i>
<i>who disgustedly fires the basketball</i>

46:57.915 --> 47:00.247
<i>at the basket after the foul was called,</i>

47:00.350 --> 47:02.648
<i>and Dru Joyce has just been hit</i>
<i>with a technical foul.</i>

47:02.753 --> 47:05.153
<i>The key to this is now, after the free throws,</i>

47:05.255 --> 47:07.553
<i>Roger Bacon gets the basketball.</i>

47:07.691 --> 47:11.923
<i>Well, for all intents and purposes, that put</i>
<i>the nail in the coffin, I think, for St. V.</i>

47:12.029 --> 47:16.762
<i>A lack of composure down the stretch</i>
<i>has hurt Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary.</i>

47:17.034 --> 47:18.899
<i>At the line will be...</i>

47:34.051 --> 47:37.612
<i>Cincinnati Roger Bacon has upset</i>
<i>Akron's St. Vincent-St. Mary</i>

47:37.721 --> 47:39.916
<i>and won</i>
<i>the Division II State Championship.</i>

47:40.023 --> 47:43.049
<i>The first loss to a team</i>
<i>from the state of Ohio</i>

47:43.360 --> 47:46.056
<i>since the 1998-'99 season.</i>

47:46.163 --> 47:49.758
<i>Cincinnati Roger Bacon</i>
<i>is the Division II State Champions.</i>

48:44.688 --> 48:49.819
<i>I never thought I'd be a basketball coach.</i>
<i>I grew up playing football,</i>

48:50.127 --> 48:54.530
<i>and if it was gonna be anything</i>
<i>coaching-wise, it would've been football.</i>

48:54.998 --> 48:57.558
The way I approached basketball,

48:58.101 --> 49:01.229
once I understood
that this is what Dru wanted to do,

49:01.338 --> 49:04.933
<i>was to give him the best</i>
<i>that I could give him,</i>

49:05.042 --> 49:08.910
and, honestly,
my knowledge of basketball was not great.

49:11.348 --> 49:14.511
I think that I've learned
in a nontraditional way.

49:14.851 --> 49:16.910
I'm a lot older getting started doing this

49:17.020 --> 49:21.616
because I was just a dad, honestly,
helping out my son.

49:22.592 --> 49:26.153
Interspersed in here
are books from different authors.

49:26.863 --> 49:29.923
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, he wrote a book.
I got his book,

49:30.033 --> 49:33.525
and <i>Great Quotes,</i>
I use that all the time with the guys.

49:34.004 --> 49:40.341
These are all the videos. That's how
I've learnt the games and grown as a coach.

49:40.711 --> 49:44.169
This is where I spend a lot of time.

49:44.715 --> 49:47.149
You keep learning.
You don't ever stop learning,

49:47.250 --> 49:49.582
and I'm committed
to never stopping to learn.

49:49.686 --> 49:52.655
As long as I coach,
I'm going to keep learning.

49:52.756 --> 49:53.780
I want them to be the best

49:53.890 --> 49:58.350
and for them to be the best I felt like
I had to try to be the best, so...

50:08.905 --> 50:11.499
<i>My dad took the loss real hard. I mean,</i>

50:11.608 --> 50:15.203
<i>a lot of articles</i>
<i>and reporters really let him have it.</i>

50:16.513 --> 50:20.108
<i>There was an article written</i>
<i>after the loss of the state championship,</i>

50:20.217 --> 50:24.415
<i>and he wrote, "When the team</i>
<i>needed me most, I wasn't there. "</i>

50:29.059 --> 50:31.527
<i>You have to consummate your dreams.</i>

50:33.764 --> 50:36.961
<i>We can only do that</i>
<i>by being dreamers ourselves</i>

50:37.067 --> 50:40.036
<i>and pondering for years</i>
<i>what dreams look like.</i>

50:42.172 --> 50:46.666
<i>You got a choice, and your choice</i>
<i>has impact upon your direction.</i>

50:47.110 --> 50:50.273
<i>And if you don't use your choice,</i>
<i>don't blame God,</i>

50:50.480 --> 50:53.608
<i>don't blame the people around you,</i>
<i>don't blame your circumstances.</i>

50:53.717 --> 50:58.279
<i>You can use your choice.</i>
<i>You can exercise your...</i>

51:01.858 --> 51:06.295
After the season,
I thought about it and I recognized that

51:08.231 --> 51:12.759
I had gotten caught up, you know,
and lost that perspective.

51:14.204 --> 51:17.002
<i>My job wasn't about basketball.</i>

51:17.908 --> 51:22.902
It was about helping them become men,
and I got caught up

51:23.413 --> 51:29.545
in the winning and the losing,
and I forgot, really, what I was there for.

51:32.889 --> 51:36.620
I'm going to do what I believe
God sent me here to do,

51:37.794 --> 51:40.854
and that's to build some character
in you guys.

51:42.099 --> 51:45.193
You can get onboard with me
and run with me,

51:45.302 --> 51:49.432
or you don't have to,
but this is the direction I'm taking the team.

51:52.309 --> 51:56.405
They just recommitted themselves,
you know, to the game and to each other.

51:59.416 --> 52:03.580
<i>They looked at it and they had a resolve,</i>
<i>"We're not losing anymore."</i>

52:13.563 --> 52:16.760
Five, six, seven, up.

52:28.078 --> 52:31.536
Come on, boys. You gotta give me more...

52:43.126 --> 52:45.993
<i>Going into senior season I started thinking,</i>

52:46.096 --> 52:48.860
<i>"How am I gonna set our team up</i>
<i>the right way to win it next year?"</i>

52:48.965 --> 52:51.024
It was an eye-opener for me,

52:51.601 --> 52:55.002
on me being a leader
that I wanted to be for our team.

52:55.305 --> 52:57.535
<i>I remember sitting</i>
<i>in an American Government class</i>

52:57.641 --> 52:59.939
<i>with Sian and Bron, like, "Man,</i>

53:00.043 --> 53:04.241
"this is our last year. We have to win.
I'm doing whatever Coach Dru say.

53:04.347 --> 53:05.974
"If anybody say something to him,

53:06.082 --> 53:08.516
"I'm getting on them.
You know what I'm saying?"

53:08.618 --> 53:12.247
<i>We couldn't get past that father-son part</i>
<i>and the coach and player part.</i>

53:12.355 --> 53:14.346
<i>I just handled it terribly.</i>

53:14.457 --> 53:17.688
<i>I just been trying to listen to everything</i>
<i>he has to say 'cause I know,</i>

53:17.794 --> 53:19.921
<i>even though I might think I'm right,</i>
<i>he's the coach.</i>

53:20.030 --> 53:24.865
<i>I can't look at it with that father-son thing.</i>
<i>I can't bring that into the table.</i>

53:27.037 --> 53:31.064
If we're going to be the best,
we have to beat the best.

53:31.241 --> 53:32.469
And the only way you can beat the best

53:32.576 --> 53:35.443
is if you put them on a schedule
and play them.

53:35.679 --> 53:39.581
<i>We were ranked 23.</i>
<i>We took that as a sign of disrespect.</i>

53:39.849 --> 53:42.511
We were committed to proving them wrong.

53:42.619 --> 53:44.211
It was gonna be the last time
we played together.

53:44.321 --> 53:45.549
That's what made it so important.

53:45.655 --> 53:47.885
<i>This was our last opportunity to do</i>

53:47.991 --> 53:50.926
<i>what we've been dreaming about</i>
<i>since the fifth grade.</i>

53:55.065 --> 53:58.398
It was tough because Willie
had been through so much,

53:58.969 --> 54:03.668
<i>but I recognized that, for the good</i>
<i>of the team, that Corey had to start.</i>

54:10.013 --> 54:13.881
This is Willie's yearbook.
Think he was, like, fifth grade.

54:14.150 --> 54:18.610
"What do you want to be in the future?"
"A basketball player in the NBA."

54:19.789 --> 54:21.689
"If you had one wish, what would it be?"

54:22.592 --> 54:25.083
"For my future to come true."

54:26.296 --> 54:29.265
<i>I looked up to him at everything.</i>
<i>A person I could talk to,</i>

54:29.366 --> 54:32.130
<i>wanted to be a point guard just like him.</i>

54:33.069 --> 54:37.472
<i>Growing up in Chicago, my mother</i>
<i>and father going through things at the time.</i>

54:37.574 --> 54:40.304
<i>My sister was taking care of me</i>
<i>at the time, primarily.</i>

54:40.410 --> 54:46.212
<i>Willie saw a family pretty much be stifled</i>
<i>by drugs and alcohol and jail</i>

54:46.316 --> 54:48.011
<i>and things like that.</i>

54:48.118 --> 54:52.452
He was struggling at school.
Self-esteem was really low.

54:52.922 --> 54:55.891
My sister felt like I needed
a male influence in my life.

54:55.992 --> 54:59.758
Willie moved from Chicago in here,
moved in with his brother, who was still,

54:59.863 --> 55:02.957
you know, fresh out of college.
It was kind of tough on Willie.

55:03.066 --> 55:05.830
<i>You know, Willie was the youngest child</i>
<i>in the family at that time,</i>

55:05.935 --> 55:07.835
<i>so it was emotional.</i>

55:07.937 --> 55:09.336
I remember the weekend before I left,

55:09.439 --> 55:13.205
my sister taking me to go wash
all my clothes, so I have stuff clean.

55:13.310 --> 55:15.471
<i>She folded all my stuff, put it in a trash bag,</i>

55:15.578 --> 55:19.412
<i>and I remember waking up early</i>
<i>that morning and being excited to go,</i>

55:19.516 --> 55:21.450
<i>and then her being there,</i>
<i>you know what I'm saying,</i>

55:21.551 --> 55:23.451
<i>making sure all my clothes were there,</i>

55:23.553 --> 55:27.853
you know what I'm saying, driving off
and her being in the rearview,

55:28.325 --> 55:30.020
that was real hard.

55:34.564 --> 55:38.227
<i>I'm thinking I was probably</i>
<i>maybe about 22, 23</i>

55:38.335 --> 55:41.463
<i>when he came up here,</i>
<i>and, you know, it was hard.</i>

55:42.038 --> 55:46.304
<i>We didn't have any money, you know.</i>
<i>We were college students,</i>

55:46.710 --> 55:49.645
<i>and to bring a child into our lives,</i>

55:49.946 --> 55:54.178
<i>we just couldn't do some of the things</i>
<i>that a 22-year-old college student would do.</i>

55:54.284 --> 55:58.983
<i>We had to stay home some nights</i>
<i>when friends of ours had invited us out,</i>

55:59.089 --> 56:02.991
<i>or we had to find a babysitter</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>

56:03.727 --> 56:06.389
- Well, Will, what you think?
- I like it.

56:07.197 --> 56:09.290
- Were you surprised?
- Yes.

56:10.567 --> 56:14.731
<i>Going into high school, he was probably</i>
<i>one of the top athletes in the city.</i>

56:14.838 --> 56:17.568
<i>In my freshman year playing football,</i>
<i>I dislocated my shoulder.</i>

56:17.674 --> 56:21.440
<i>Ever since then, I just felt like</i>
<i>my basketball game wasn't the same.</i>

56:21.544 --> 56:27.039
He lost his touch, you know.
He could never get really fully in shape,

56:27.150 --> 56:30.779
and it was just... I just think that shoulder
just really did him wrong.

56:30.887 --> 56:36.086
I felt his pain, as an athlete,
as a big brother, as a father figure.

56:36.459 --> 56:42.329
You know, the passion that he has,
and to see something taken from him.

56:43.400 --> 56:46.426
<i>That probably was the hardest time</i>
<i>of his life.</i>

56:47.971 --> 56:50.599
<i>It hurt a lot. It really did.</i>
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

56:50.707 --> 56:53.870
<i>But you can make your opportunity</i>
<i>happen wherever.</i>

56:55.979 --> 56:58.971
<i>I definitely learned a lot from my brother</i>
<i>about sacrifice.</i>

56:59.082 --> 57:02.779
<i>I can't imagine what he had to go through</i>
<i>for me to be there.</i>

57:07.490 --> 57:13.895
I think in order for you to excel or achieve,
you have to make sacrifices,

57:14.063 --> 57:18.124
and if you really love
and you care for people around you,

57:18.802 --> 57:22.135
you know, you sacrifice for them
as well as yourself.

57:24.207 --> 57:28.610
When Willie didn't start, he could've cried
and bitched about it, but he didn't.

57:28.711 --> 57:30.542
<i>He came off the bench</i>
<i>for the betterment of the team,</i>

57:30.647 --> 57:32.478
<i>and when I seen that, I realized</i>

57:32.582 --> 57:34.607
<i>that it was something bigger</i>
<i>than individuals,</i>

57:34.717 --> 57:36.651
<i>it was just something bigger than all of us.</i>

57:37.687 --> 57:38.813
Today,

57:39.055 --> 57:43.151
you know, this is one of the biggest,
most pivotal times of our life, right now.

57:43.259 --> 57:46.126
When a link breaks, everything falls apart.

57:46.696 --> 57:49.062
Can't ride a bike with no chain,
you know what I mean?

57:49.165 --> 57:52.601
Think of it as a wing.
You know what I'm saying? A unit.

57:53.536 --> 57:57.404
I wanted to be a part of something
besides basketball.

57:58.141 --> 58:00.541
You know, those guys were friends
outside of basketball.

58:00.643 --> 58:02.668
<i>Hung out all the time, you know?</i>

58:02.779 --> 58:05.509
<i>No matter how you think about it,</i>
<i>you want to be a part.</i>

58:05.615 --> 58:07.173
<i>That catalyst, that leader,</i>

58:07.283 --> 58:10.650
that person that you can lean on,
confide in and talk to.

58:10.753 --> 58:13.551
<i>But I think once you felt the love</i>
<i>that we all have for each other,</i>

58:13.656 --> 58:18.218
<i>I think that was bigger than being selfish.</i>
<i>So out of the Fab 4, we got together</i>

58:18.328 --> 58:21.388
<i>and decided</i>
<i>that we wanted to make it the Fab 5.</i>

58:21.898 --> 58:25.231
<i>Senior year, it was all five of us,</i>
<i>hands on each other's shoulders.</i>

58:25.335 --> 58:28.930
<i>Nothing can stand in our way,</i>
<i>nothing's gonna separate us.</i>

58:33.042 --> 58:37.001
<i>A high-school game has attracted a crowd</i>
<i>of 10,000 here tonight,</i>

58:37.113 --> 58:40.514
<i>but it's not just any high-school game.</i>
<i>It's phenom LeBron James</i>

58:40.617 --> 58:44.053
<i>against the number-one ranked team</i>
<i>in the country, Oak Hill.</i>

58:44.153 --> 58:45.984
<i>Oak Hill is this basketball factory.</i>

58:46.089 --> 58:49.684
<i>It's where kids go</i>
<i>to become major college stars and pros,</i>

58:49.792 --> 58:53.990
so, to have the opportunity to beat them
is like to beat a national all-star team.

58:54.831 --> 58:56.696
<i>The stakes of that game were massive.</i>

58:56.799 --> 58:59.700
<i>Dick Vitale and Bill Walton came in</i>
<i>to do the game.</i>

58:59.802 --> 59:02.703
<i>I mean, it was treated like</i>
<i>it was a Duke-North Carolina game.</i>

59:02.805 --> 59:06.502
<i>There was so much pressure</i>
<i>to see what this kid and this team had.</i>

59:06.609 --> 59:09.009
<i>- How good is LeBron James?</i>
- Well, simply put, Dan,

59:09.112 --> 59:11.603
LeBron James is
the best high-school basketball player

59:11.714 --> 59:14.205
I have ever seen,
and I think, as a 17-year-old,

59:14.317 --> 59:17.252
<i>he's better than Kobe Bryant was</i>
<i>at the same age.</i>

59:17.353 --> 59:20.288
<i>We felt like, in order to win</i>
<i>a national championship,</i>

59:20.390 --> 59:22.324
<i>we had to beat Oak Hill.</i>

59:22.625 --> 59:24.092
For LeBron James, as great as he is,

59:24.193 --> 59:26.093
this is the best high-school team
in the country,

59:26.195 --> 59:28.129
some of the best competition
he's ever faced.

59:28.865 --> 59:33.097
<i>When you see a team like an Oak Hill,</i>
<i>great players from all over the country,</i>

59:33.202 --> 59:37.138
well, I got a group of kids from,
pretty much, the neighborhood.

59:49.385 --> 59:52.877
That was our chant before the games,
before we came out.

59:53.389 --> 59:57.450
It was letting people know that this is not
the same team that came out last year.

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:05.498
"We're the Soul Squad,"
because it's, like, all of us together.

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:11.069
We weren't here for no fun and games.
It was serious, it was business-like,

01:00:11.174 --> 01:00:13.699
and it was exactly what the song said,
"We ready."

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:25.720
I think that was the first pillar of our season

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:28.791
that let us know that we could make a run
at this whole thing.

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:34.055
<i>They only played, like,</i>
<i>maybe three or four Ohio teams.</i>

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.227
<i>Forget about the yellow school buses.</i>

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:38.391
<i>They're going up</i>
<i>to the Akron-Canton Airport,</i>

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:41.436
<i>and flying to their games.</i>

01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:04.691
<i>Are you serious? Are you serious?</i>
<i>Are you serious?</i>

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:10.692
We weren't just beating teams.
We were dismantling them.

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:21.702
Playing the best basketball of our lives,
by far.

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:28.814
<i>There was no complacency with us.</i>

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:32.445
I mean, we would win the one game
and it was time to move on to the next.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.175
<i>We went to Philly</i>
<i>to play Strawberry Mansion,</i>

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:02.376
<i>which was the best team that Philly had,</i>
<i>the best scoring high-school basketball</i>

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:04.316
<i>in Philadelphia.</i>
<i>More than Wilt Chamberlain.</i>

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.788
<i>And we dominated them.</i>

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:19.066
<i>Played the best team in North Carolina.</i>
<i>Blew them out.</i>

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:23.129
We were winning the way
we were supposed to win.

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:24.331
We were winning by defense.

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:42.621
You know,
my teammates is like my brothers.

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:47.424
And, you know, coach is like my brother.
You know, we all a big family.

01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:52.433
Let's take it to them
off-white velours you got on.

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:55.197
- These are white as day.
- No. Yesterday.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.142
It seems like more guys
are getting into the mix.

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:06.011
Well, yeah, there's a chemistry here that,
honestly, last year we didn't have,

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:09.016
and then there's a commitment here
to defend.

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:11.843
<i>We won because we were together.</i>

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:16.482
<i>We won because we respected Coach Dru</i>
<i>as a coach, as a mentor, as a leader,</i>

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:20.793
and we had one goal, and that was
to win the national championship,

01:03:20.897 --> 01:03:22.831
and we wouldn't let nothing
stand in our way.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:41.109
<i>LeBron James brings his act</i>
<i>to the west coast,</i>

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:44.152
<i>as St. Vincent-St. Mary of Akron, Ohio,</i>

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:49.020
<i>takes on a powerhouse from Santa Ana,</i>
<i>California, number four, Mater Dei,</i>

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:51.787
<i>here in Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles.</i>

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:53.885
<i>You know,</i>
<i>there's a lot at stake in this game.</i>

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:58.399
<i>The winning team will be taking over</i>
<i>the number-one ranking in the country.</i>

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.265
<i>Now, Dan, the Irish are gonna have</i>
<i>to find a way to do it today</i>

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:04.806
<i>without Sian Cotton,</i>
<i>one of their strong inside forces.</i>

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:09.511
<i>Undefeated on the season.</i>
<i>Without him, they're a different team.</i>

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.449
<i>When I was about 10 years old</i>
<i>my dad told me,</i>

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:18.586
<i>"'lf you don't get a scholarship,</i>
<i>you're not going to college. "'</i>

01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:22.279
Growing up being Lee Cotton Junior's son,
we couldn't go anywhere

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.484
without somebody recognizing our dad,

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:28.394
and somebody telling us, "Your dad
was a bad boy at South High School.

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:30.259
<i>"And listen to what he has to tell you."</i>

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:33.164
<i>So we always wanted</i>
<i>to make our dad proud,</i>

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:36.761
<i>especially since he's the one</i>
<i>who taught us how to play.</i>

01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:41.299
<i>Sian really looked up to him a lot</i>
<i>and copied a lot of things that LC did.</i>

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:43.674
You know, wanted to be like LC.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:49.114
We started taking dance when I was four,
probably. I mean, I liked it.

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:51.380
He was a ballerina.

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:55.689
<i>And then when LC started to grow</i>
<i>a mustache, Sian went in the bathroom,</i>

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:58.350
got some eyeliner
and painted a mustache on himself

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:01.362
so he could have a mustache
like his brother.

01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:06.802
<i>Growing up, he was more than a brother.</i>
<i>He was my teacher, too.</i>

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:10.031
<i>A lot of the beliefs that I have now</i>
<i>he installed in me.</i>

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:12.334
<i>You know,</i>
<i>sports was more than just a game.</i>

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:15.569
<i>It was something that taught you</i>
<i>how to be a man.</i>

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:20.879
I was hard on him because, at an early age,
I realized he was better than I was.

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:27.347
LC, as more of a leader,
was able to give Sian some direction.

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:32.828
<i>Once he started seeing how his basketball</i>
<i>skills tied into his football skills,</i>

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:35.363
he looked at me and said,
"This football thing is me."

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:37.796
And I said, "I know, so we're gonna do it."

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:42.465
Hello, everybody. A big day for a big name
in local high-school football.

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:45.472
<i>Sian Cotton was named</i>
<i>the U.S. Army All-American Player.</i>

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:49.874
<i>He's one of just 78 high-school players</i>
<i>across the country to be selected.</i>

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:54.382
<i>With that honor comes an invite to play in</i>
<i>the All-American Bowl and the defensive...</i>

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:58.943
<i>The football game was the same weekend</i>
<i>we were set to play Mater Dei.</i>

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:02.386
<i>I felt like I didn't want</i>
<i>to let my teammates down,</i>

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:06.086
<i>but at the same time</i>
<i>I didn't want to let my family down.</i>

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:09.865
<i>We needed Sian out there.</i>
<i>We couldn't lose. We couldn't afford to lose.</i>

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:12.901
We lost, it's over.
Our dream is down the toilet.

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:19.407
<i>I told him, "This right here is all about you,</i>
<i>me, and my mom and my dad. "</i>

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:25.210
L helped me realize it was more
than just me playing football, you know?

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:27.942
It was my ticket to go to college.

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:30.981
<i>So now we're missing one of our key guys.</i>

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:34.750
<i>Willie is put into a position</i>
<i>where he has to play and start.</i>

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:38.587
Mater Dei is basically the same team
that we had lost to in eighth grade.

01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:41.891
<i>Remember these Mater Dei players played</i>
<i>against James at an AAU tournament</i>

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.727
<i>a few years ago,</i>
<i>when they were eighth-graders...</i>

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:48.293
<i>And they beat LeBron back in Orlando</i>
<i>in the 14-and-under AAU championship.</i>

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:51.665
<i>I don't know if they remember,</i>
<i>but I know everybody on my team</i>

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:54.971
<i>definitely did, like,</i>
<i>"We ain't forgetting not one of those faces."</i>

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:58.808
<i>It was basically like you had a "Won it" ad</i>
<i>on our locker-room door.</i>

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:01.576
<i>We wanted this game more than anything.</i>

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:09.515
<i>Joyce gonna settle things down a little bit.</i>
<i>His coach, his dad.</i>

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:15.223
<i>Joyce misses the three,</i>
<i>now a run-out for Mater Dei.</i>

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:19.791
<i>And is slammed by Marcel Jones,</i>
<i>a 6'11"...6'7", rather, junior.</i>

01:07:19.902 --> 01:07:22.166
<i>That's where Mater Dei</i>
<i>can score a lot of points.</i>

01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:24.739
<i>Here is Strawberry, has it blocked!</i>

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:31.475
<i>Here's James. Look at the pass!</i>

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:36.248
<i>Showtime early for LeBron James.</i>

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.158
<i>Upper... Yes.</i>

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:56.031
<i>... to Jones. Same spot, same result!</i>

01:07:58.307 --> 01:08:01.435
<i>He gets the ball inside, triple-team.</i>
<i>What a pass!</i>

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.107
<i>James.</i>

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:08.378
<i>McGee with a put-back.</i>

01:08:09.318 --> 01:08:11.411
<i>Time's winding down on Mater Dei,</i>

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.149
<i>as LeBron James and St. Vincent-St. Mary</i>
<i>of Akron, Ohio, remain undefeated.</i>

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:21.389
<i>They pick up their third win</i>
<i>over a top-10 team already this season.</i>

01:08:22.363 --> 01:08:25.527
<i>When we won that game,</i>
<i>it felt like I had some revenge.</i>

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:28.761
It felt like I could close the book
on that deal.

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:35.840
Seeing what we had accomplished
from a few months ago, being ranked 23rd,

01:08:36.578 --> 01:08:39.479
or years ago, when we weren't ranked at all,

01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:43.343
or even more years ago,
when we weren't mentioned.

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:48.220
The day it came out,
and we've seen that St. Vincent-St. Mary

01:08:48.323 --> 01:08:53.283
was number one in the country, it was
probably one of the best days of our lives.

01:09:43.444 --> 01:09:44.810
<i>But there isn't a person</i>

01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:47.576
<i>or an organization</i>
<i>that put Akron on the map</i>

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:51.380
<i>like this St. Vincent-St. Mary</i>
<i>basketball team players.</i>

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:04.627
Do you feel like the bull's-eye
is on your back

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:06.098
'cause you guys are number one
in the nation,

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:08.534
or is that something
you don't even think about for games?

01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:10.434
We've been the bull's-eye
since the sixth grade,

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:13.997
and every time we go out there,
we're the number-one team in the country.

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:15.576
Everyone wants to knock us off.

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:20.673
<i>It was a very critical eye</i>
<i>being turned towards LeBron at that time.</i>

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:22.774
<i>He had gone past the awe stage,</i>

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.910
<i>and he'd gone</i>
<i>to the full-blown celebrity stage,</i>

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:28.114
<i>which is where fans and media</i>
<i>are looking for flaws.</i>

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:32.889
<i>Phenom LeBron James and his team</i>
<i>take to the court tonight,</i>

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:35.725
<i>but there's a lot of attention being paid</i>
<i>to what's, maybe, in the parking lot.</i>

01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:37.932
<i>Ohio State high-school officials</i>

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:40.934
are determining whether James
has forfeited his amateur status

01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:43.561
by accepting a $50,000 vehicle.

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:46.871
<i>Here's a kid who grew up</i>
<i>in subsidized housing,</i>

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:51.572
so how did they come up with the money
to pay for a $55,000 vehicle?

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:55.710
Check out this baby, huh? It kind of
looks like LeBron's vehicle, does it?

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:59.117
There are some people that say, "Hey,
what about some of these affluent kids

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:02.850
"whose parents buy them Mercedes?"
And, you know, it can go both ways.

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:05.722
But his mom was granted a loan
understanding that

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:08.922
that money would be paid back,
which they weren't worried about.

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:12.265
<i>It was a legitimate purchase,</i>
<i>but it was just an opportunity</i>

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:15.166
<i>for the people who were looking</i>
<i>for something to criticize LeBron</i>

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:17.239
<i>to have something to latch onto.</i>

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:21.740
<i>We love to build people up,</i>
<i>and then when the story gets too stale,</i>

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:24.210
<i>we kind of dig a little bit deeper</i>
<i>so that we can get stories</i>

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:25.712
<i>that people would be interested again.</i>

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:28.512
<i>How does he have two cell phones</i>

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:30.778
when his mom doesn't have a job,
he doesn't have a job?

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:33.514
Are you even concerned
about the eligibility issue?

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:36.921
This pro lifestyle,
how does that affect your teammates?

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:40.757
Even people in Akron want you to lose.
How does that make you feel?

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:45.926
<i>Whenever you're on a pedestal, the people</i>
<i>who are surrounding you are cheering...</i>

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:49.133
Hey, LeBron,
you gonna ride in that Hummer?

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:52.440
<i>... but there's a whole lot</i>
<i>who want to see you fall, too.</i>

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.422
<i>I said to LeBron one thing, I said,</i>
<i>"Are you ready for the negative press?"</i>

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:12.483
And he said, "Yeah, Coach Dru, I'm ready."
And I left it at that.

01:12:13.195 --> 01:12:15.857
<i>We'll debate the pros and cons</i>
<i>of making a prep star</i>

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:17.488
<i>into a national icon.</i>

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:20.227
James is prematurely capitalizing
on his fame.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:24.568
When did this madness begin? Just how
did it become too much too soon?

01:12:24.973 --> 01:12:26.804
<i>It had gotten too big.</i>

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:31.309
<i>Too many people were now scrutinizing him</i>
<i>that he could barely breathe</i>

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:36.715
<i>without having someone check to see,</i>
<i>"Is this guy breaking the rules, is he legit?"</i>

01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:40.987
<i>It's something that the system</i>
<i>in high school</i>

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:43.456
<i>wasn't really designed to handle.</i>

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:50.659
<i>This is</i> SportsCenter.

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:56.164
LeBron James is ineligible to play
for the rest of his high-school season.

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:59.263
Declared such, Friday afternoon,
by the Ohio governing body

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:02.503
over two retro jerseys he accepted
from a Cleveland store.

01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:06.305
<i>He had taken a jersey</i>
<i>from someone he knew as a gift.</i>

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.383
<i>The Ohio High School Athletic Association</i>

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:10.918
<i>was facing</i>
<i>an unprecedented set of circumstances.</i>

01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:13.613
<i>They had this incredible player</i>
<i>they didn't really know how to handle</i>

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:16.418
<i>who looked like he was obviously</i>
<i>benefiting from his fame.</i>

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:19.460
<i>And I think they just got sort of sick</i>
<i>of all the complaints</i>

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:22.689
<i>from the member schools</i>
<i>and felt like they had to do something.</i>

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:25.198
<i>So they just decided to take swift action.</i>

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:29.862
My ruling is immediate.
This is an unusual situation.

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:34.841
And because we've had to address
so many issues surrounding it,

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:37.741
I think, as leaders,
we need to take a look at it.

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:40.441
<i>There was no chartered territory for this.</i>

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:44.383
<i>There was boxes of shoes</i>
<i>arriving at his house daily,</i>

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.622
<i>and for him to be in trouble</i>
<i>over two jerseys that he got from a store</i>

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:50.191
<i>was comical.</i>

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:53.625
He's no exception,
whether it's LeBron James or Mary Jones

01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:55.162
or Pete Smith.

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:57.662
<i>St. Vincent-St. Mary right now</i>
<i>is ranked number one in the nation,</i>

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:59.734
<i>and without LeBron James playing,</i>

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:01.530
obviously they'll drop
from that number-one ranking.

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:03.628
They have five games left this season.

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.764
<i>This is a team that has been very good</i>
<i>the past few years.</i>

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:08.672
<i>They've gone to</i>
<i>the state championship games...</i>

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:17.582
When I heard that I was ineligible
for the rest of the season

01:14:19.688 --> 01:14:25.649
I couldn't think, I couldn't believe it.
I felt that I had let my teammates down.

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:35.260
<i>LeBron was still in diapers,</i>
<i>going on two years old.</i>

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:37.734
<i>So I bought him</i>
<i>a Little Tikes basketball hoop.</i>

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.241
From then on,
he had to have it at the highest height.

01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:43.903
And he was dunking on it, then.

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:51.076
<i>She was 16 when she had me.</i>

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:55.985
<i>The father figure that I was looking for,</i>
<i>you know, wasn't ever there. Ever.</i>

01:14:57.526 --> 01:15:00.689
Your mom raised you
pretty much by herself,

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:02.957
<i>was a teenage mother, unmarried.</i>

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:05.863
First of all, do you know
your biological father's whereabouts?

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:10.905
No, not really. But I'm not really
even concentrating on that,

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:15.471
because I really have my father
and my mother all tied up in one,

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:20.478
and that's Gloria James. At this point
I don't really need nobody else.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:27.853
The only thing that didn't help,
'cause me kept growing every so often.

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:31.119
You know, and she had to keep throwing
clothes away and go buy new ones.

01:15:31.226 --> 01:15:32.488
That didn't help.

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:35.791
So I just bought clothes bigger
to begin with

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:39.163
and just rolled them up
and put a few cuffs in them.

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:42.133
Gave him time to grow into them.

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:49.537
<i>It was constantly on the move for us.</i>
<i>From five years old till eight,</i>

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:54.544
<i>we probably moved 10, 12 times</i>
<i>in three years, four or five schools.</i>

01:15:56.618 --> 01:16:00.952
We didn't have any definite place
to reside at.

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:05.988
<i>We didn't know if we was gonna have</i>
<i>somewhere to sleep the following night.</i>

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:07.994
The hardest thing for me
was to meet new friends,

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:10.121
going to new schools all the time,

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.826
<i>and, you know, finally get comfortable</i>
<i>with a group of friends at one school</i>

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:14.800
<i>and then having to leave.</i>

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:17.263
<i>He didn't have a normal childhood.</i>

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:21.399
<i>I mean, hell, he even lived</i>
<i>in some of the worst projects in town.</i>

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:23.974
I mean, you definitely see things,
at a young age,

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:26.377
that you don't never want your kids to see,

01:16:26.481 --> 01:16:30.645
<i>you know, violence and drug abuse</i>
<i>and police sirens.</i>

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:35.615
<i>It didn't matter where we were. Being with</i>
<i>my mother, only thing that mattered.</i>

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:41.754
<i>I believe we became even closer</i>
<i>than the normal parent-child relationship</i>

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:45.629
due to our circumstances
and enduring them together,

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:47.167
going through them together.

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:51.128
<i>I never complained, never.</i>

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.932
<i>We were already going through tough times.</i>

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:55.566
<i>It doesn't make it any better</i>
<i>if I'm complaining.</i>

01:16:56.078 --> 01:17:00.913
My mother said it was time to go, packed
my little book bag and it was time to roll.

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:06.317
<i>I remember my mother sitting me down</i>
<i>and basically telling me,</i>

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:10.221
<i>because of certain situations,</i>
<i>that she may be gone for a little while,</i>

01:17:10.325 --> 01:17:14.785
<i>that I was gonna be living</i>
<i>with one of my coaches. It was a challenge.</i>

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:18.766
That's all I cared about
when I was growing up,

01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:23.861
if I was gonna be able to wake up and
my mother was still alive or still by my side.

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:28.508
That was...
Because I was already without a father,

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:32.940
you know, and I didn't want
to be without both of my parents.

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:37.150
You know, so,
it was definitely scary and tough.

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:41.747
<i>The thing that I had on the court</i>
<i>that I didn't have off the court was security,</i>

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:44.883
<i>because every day we went to the gym,</i>
<i>I knew I'm gonna get picked,</i>

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:49.225
<i>or we were gonna win basketball games,</i>
<i>or we're gonna win pickup games.</i>

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:52.723
I've always said
it's home away from home for me.

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:59.573
Anybody that's close to LeBron knows that
basketball court becomes his sanctuary.

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:04.078
He blocks everything out,
every bad situation or whatever.

01:18:04.379 --> 01:18:08.748
<i>When he's on that court, that's when</i>
<i>he's actually at peace and at ease.</i>

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:15.556
<i>Gradually, my mother found a place.</i>

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:16.815
Hey.

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:20.061
<i>I had a place to sleep,</i>
<i>and I knew we weren't going anywhere.</i>

01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:22.460
- Anybody home?
- No, I fooled you.

01:18:23.932 --> 01:18:29.268
So this is where I ended up moving to.
I moved into this room and...

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:34.072
If you can just imagine
just photos of all the NBA superstars

01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:35.768
was all over these walls.

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:38.243
This whole wall
was Michael Jordan pictures.

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:42.112
From, like, right here
was all Allen lverson, was right here.

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:45.748
This was Kobe Bryant's wall right here,
from, like, right here over,

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:48.982
and then everybody else
I kind of just filled in.

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:52.124
It was... It's crazy to see
that they got everything out of here.

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:56.186
I put staples all in the walls
and tape and duct tape all over the walls,

01:18:56.298 --> 01:18:59.563
so it's kind of funny
to see that it's all gone now.

01:19:00.335 --> 01:19:04.362
It was home. It was funny to see
that everybody wanted to be here.

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:06.872
You know, everybody wanted to come...
I mean, why here?

01:19:06.975 --> 01:19:09.170
- You wouldn't have thought that.
- I mean, all my friends got houses.

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:11.142
- Low-income houses. Yeah.
- All my friends got houses.

01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:14.306
All my friends got houses,
but you look outside,

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:18.052
- their parents are dropping them off here.
- Right here.

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:20.688
Didn't even have time
to lock the damn door.

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:22.620
"Just leave it unlocked, come in."

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:24.783
- "Just leave the door open."
- Yeah.

01:19:24.893 --> 01:19:26.554
And they was coming.

01:19:30.198 --> 01:19:34.100
<i>Due to the circumstances,</i>
<i>he had to grow up being moving.</i>

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:38.002
No stability with friendships.
His relationship with Sian,

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:43.339
Dru, Rome, Willie is as important
as his relationship with me.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.772
<i>There's one thing about Bron,</i>
<i>he loves people around him.</i>

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:49.714
<i>Never liked being by his self,</i>

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:53.447
<i>and when he found us, he found homes,</i>
<i>he found father figures,</i>

01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:57.047
<i>he found one of the greatest things</i>
<i>that happened to him, friendships.</i>

01:19:57.159 --> 01:20:00.219
<i>Once I had that security, finally,</i>
<i>with friends,</i>

01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:04.492
you know, I automatically, like...
These are the guys I'm gonna be with.

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:12.073
<i>No matter what happens, these are the guys</i>
<i>I'm gonna be loyal to more than anybody.</i>

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:16.304
<i>These are my brothers.</i>
<i>These are my four best friends.</i>

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:22.514
<i>Our next senior, Mr. LeBron James!</i>

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:29.880
<i>They grew up in basketball together,</i>

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:34.689
so the love that they shared for the game
was because of one another.

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:48.368
Everyone's saying St. Vincent-St. Mary
today beginning life without LeBron.

01:20:56.551 --> 01:21:00.510
I remember to this day going to practice,
and I couldn't practice,

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:04.421
<i>and I was sitting on the sideline crying,</i>
<i>the whole practice,</i>

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:08.160
<i>just because I couldn't be out there</i>
<i>for my teammates,</i>

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:13.131
and I knew that at some point
they were gonna need me,

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:17.465
and I wanted to be there for them,
and I couldn't.

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:26.837
Hey, this is what the ruling is so far,
that LeBron can't play this game.

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:30.449
I know that he wants what you want,

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:34.785
and he wants you to win
and he wants you guys to win for him,

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:38.520
and, you know, for yourselves
and to keep the dream alive

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:41.357
and understand that he loves the game.

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:44.966
I can tell you one thing,

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:49.996
he's gonna be the biggest cheerleader
in the crowd.

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:52.037
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:53.972
- One, two, three.
- Team.

01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:56.168
- Four, five, six.
- Work hard.

01:21:57.879 --> 01:22:01.906
<i>Live from the James A. Rhodes Arena</i>
<i>on the campus of the University of Akron,</i>

01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:05.976
<i>welcome to Akron's St. Vincent-St. Mary</i>
<i>Fighting Irish basketball.</i>

01:22:06.087 --> 01:22:07.987
<i>My, oh, my, how things have changed.</i>

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:11.183
<i>Full house as usual</i>
<i>for this Sunday afternoon game.</i>

01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:13.591
<i>But it's electric for the wrong reason.</i>

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:16.630
<i>Obviously, the LeBron situation</i>
<i>was big news not only here</i>

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:18.028
<i>but all around the country.</i>

01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:20.499
<i>It was emotionally</i>
<i>and psychologically taxing</i>

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.001
<i>just before you even played the game.</i>

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:24.367
<i>It was something that was in the papers.</i>
<i>It was on</i> SportsCenter.

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:30.138
<i>It was something that was a big buildup</i>
<i>just to see how they'd perform without him.</i>

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:35.376
The clock's about to start, fellas.
Look, it's been a great journey.

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:41.946
It's not over. I don't believe that
this is the time for us to pack it in.

01:22:42.657 --> 01:22:44.887
I don't think you believe that.

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:49.589
Today, if we were ever unified,
we need to be even more unified today.

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:53.034
<i>Does your son seem any different</i>
<i>out there today?</i>

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:57.127
Of course he's different, because
an integral part of his team is missing.

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:59.798
My son is heartbroken for LeBron.

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:03.642
They all are. They're all hurting.
They're heartbroken right now.

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:06.974
This is the biggest game of the season.

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:11.882
This is the biggest game of the season
because tomorrow is not promised

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:15.986
and the past is over.
All we got is right now.

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:18.352
Let's take care of right now.

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:22.121
Everyone wants to speak otherwise.
This is a great team,

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:25.393
with a great, great player,
but this is a great team, all right?

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:29.994
This is a great team. And don't you ever sell
yourself short of believing that this isn't.

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:34.132
But, hey, I'm just saying words.
You guys gotta do it on the floor.

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:37.770
Play hard, play smart, have fun, all right?

01:23:37.879 --> 01:23:39.278
- Amen!
- Amen!

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:43.348
Everyone had to step up,
and we understood that, you know?

01:23:43.451 --> 01:23:46.579
<i>There's no team in the state of Ohio</i>
<i>that's been to more final fours</i>

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:48.349
<i>than Canton McKinley.</i>

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:51.584
<i>Nobody can carry this team,</i>
<i>and the only guy who can carry this team</i>

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:55.129
<i>is wearing a black shirt</i>
<i>and sitting on the bench right now.</i>

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:58.222
You know, it was tough
seeing him on the bench,

01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:01.033
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>we had been playing together for so long.</i>

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:05.732
You know, it wasn't usual, you know?
We were together, we were the Fab 5,

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.603
so it was just tough.

01:24:12.914 --> 01:24:16.850
<i>Irish is going to have a few problems</i>
<i>getting into sync here offensively.</i>

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:20.910
<i>Nice play by McKinley</i>
<i>to get it down long and...</i>

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:23.320
<i>The Bulldogs are not intimidated.</i>

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:27.452
<i>That's got to be a big concern right now</i>
<i>for Dru Joyce, the coach.</i>

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.560
<i>Irish need to keep that lead on right now.</i>

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:36.660
<i>Three!</i>

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:41.501
<i>Somebody's hot!</i>

01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:46.944
<i>They weren't backing off anything,</i>
<i>so we could have lost at any given moment.</i>

01:24:47.048 --> 01:24:48.879
<i>Stan Hall to the hole.</i>

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:54.147
<i>For as great as they were as a team,</i>
<i>when the going got tough,</i>

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:56.246
<i>you know, 23 got the ball.</i>

01:24:58.293 --> 01:25:02.559
It was important to us that
we show everybody that we were a team.

01:25:02.964 --> 01:25:05.228
<i>We weren't just a one-man show.</i>

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:11.468
<i>Dru Joyce gets a big pocket for the Irish.</i>

01:25:12.373 --> 01:25:14.568
<i>That's a big play right there.</i>

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:20.478
We had some animosity, too.

01:25:21.049 --> 01:25:24.485
<i>When you shot LeBron down,</i>
<i>you took a shot at the team.</i>

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:28.151
<i>Sian takes the rebound.</i>

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:31.421
<i>6.6 to go.</i>

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:35.527
<i>Romeo wants the ball. Got it!</i>
<i>And there's the game.</i>

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:39.162
<i>It's a 63-62 finale.</i>

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:44.129
<i>What a ballgame.</i>

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:49.540
<i>Here are some guys who were</i>
<i>basically thought of, in most circles,</i>

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:52.272
<i>as LeBron and his sidekicks.</i>

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:57.215
<i>It said a lot about all of them,</i>
<i>for people around the country to say,</i>

01:25:57.519 --> 01:26:01.148
"You know what? These guys are really
impressive, and not just this guy."

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:03.980
<i>You have to understand</i>
<i>what this team's been through this week.</i>

01:26:05.193 --> 01:26:09.630
<i>They withstood a whole lot.</i>
<i>You know, there's been a lot of adversity,</i>

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:14.432
<i>and they stood up</i>
<i>and they met the challenge.</i>

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:18.665
<i>After watching my guys win that game,</i>

01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:23.301
<i>it made me realize that I had to do</i>
<i>whatever I could to get back on that court.</i>

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:26.313
<i>So he took it to court,</i>
<i>and after a judge decided</i>

01:26:26.414 --> 01:26:30.248
<i>that the punishment was too severe,</i>
<i>LeBron was reinstated.</i>

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:36.948
<i>There's no one in the world that</i>
<i>I'd rather play with than those four guys.</i>

01:26:44.899 --> 01:26:47.060
<i>The week of the championship game,</i>

01:26:47.168 --> 01:26:49.329
<i>it was the last time</i>
<i>I'm gonna coach my son,</i>

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:55.740
<i>it's the last time I'll coach Bron,</i>
<i>Romeo, Dru, Willie, Sian.</i>

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:58.812
<i>You recognize that, you understand that</i>

01:26:58.913 --> 01:27:03.316
<i>not only is a state championship at risk,</i>
<i>but also a national championship.</i>

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.185
<i>Nine years in the making.</i>

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:10.086
<i>From fifth grade,</i>
<i>we all dreamed about being able to play</i>

01:27:10.191 --> 01:27:12.421
<i>for the national championship.</i>

01:27:13.428 --> 01:27:15.396
<i>We had an opportunity in the eighth grade</i>
<i>and failed,</i>

01:27:15.496 --> 01:27:19.432
<i>and now, a few years later,</i>
<i>we have that same opportunity to do it.</i>

01:27:19.534 --> 01:27:21.229
<i>It hit us hard during that time.</i>

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:22.826
<i>It was, like, more than basketball.</i>

01:27:22.937 --> 01:27:26.498
<i>This is the last time</i>
<i>that we was gonna compete together.</i>

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:29.607
<i>You have a chance to go down</i>
<i>as the greatest team</i>

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:31.872
<i>in high-school basketball history.</i>

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:35.814
<i>That's gonna be around here</i>
<i>long after you guys are gone.</i>

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:38.477
<i>You've taken it full circle, fellas.</i>

01:27:38.786 --> 01:27:44.122
<i>This all started in a little gym</i>
<i>with a linoleum floor on Maple Street,</i>

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:46.284
<i>at The Salvation Army.</i>

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:48.021
<i>All the travel we've done,</i>

01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:51.860
<i>from the time you guys were 11 years old,</i>
<i>all the way across the country,</i>

01:27:51.966 --> 01:27:55.060
<i>through high school,</i>
<i>all the way to culminate,</i>

01:27:55.169 --> 01:27:58.969
<i>when that bus pulls up tomorrow,</i>
<i>where at? On Maple Street.</i>

01:28:01.075 --> 01:28:03.009
And the only question right now is,

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:05.978
"Do you get off
that bus tomorrow victorious?"

01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:20.155
All right, let's go.

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:37.775
<i>So, here we go.</i>
<i>The championship game in Division II.</i>

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:42.111
<i>St. Vincent-St. Mary's</i>
<i>with a national championship on the line.</i>

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:54.189
<i>Joyce controls,</i>
<i>and the basketball game is underway.</i>

01:28:54.295 --> 01:28:56.320
<i>Eight minutes on the clock</i>

01:28:56.698 --> 01:28:59.531
<i>and the first possession</i>
<i>goes to St. Vincent-St. Mary.</i>

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:01.534
<i>Not a seat in this house.</i>

01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:05.094
<i>It is elbow-to-elbow</i>
<i>to watch this championship game.</i>

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.605
<i>Inside they go,</i>
<i>and a slam dunk, right away!</i>

01:29:10.578 --> 01:29:15.379
<i>Coach Petrocelli talked about how</i>
<i>he's instructed his team to be patient.</i>

01:29:15.717 --> 01:29:18.345
<i>They will work and work</i>
<i>and work and work.</i>

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:23.083
<i>They're taking time off the game clock,</i>
<i>and they'll set it back up out on top.</i>

01:29:23.424 --> 01:29:25.824
<i>If they can shorten the game,</i>
<i>they may have a chance.</i>

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:29.760
<i>We kind of had the feeling</i>
<i>that they would hold the ball.</i>

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:35.097
<i>I guess early on they were just a little bit</i>
<i>better at it than we thought they would be.</i>

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:38.598
<i>Double-team.</i>
<i>Somebody's gotta be open, and it is.</i>

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:43.968
<i>They ran a minute and change off the clock.</i>

01:29:44.712 --> 01:29:47.909
<i>This is clearly the pace</i>
<i>that Coach Petrocelli wants.</i>

01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:50.483
<i>We tried everything we could</i>
<i>to speed them up,</i>

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:53.019
<i>but they had us chasing them,</i>
<i>and it was hard.</i>

01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:54.850
<i>A lot of slow action,</i>

01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:57.987
<i>- and Doug Penno making shots like that.</i>
<i>- Execution.</i>

01:29:58.092 --> 01:30:01.653
<i>To perfection.</i>
<i>Just like Roger Bacon last year,</i>

01:30:02.029 --> 01:30:04.623
<i>they're frustrating the Akron players.</i>

01:30:05.032 --> 01:30:08.399
<i>James on the rebound. What a shot by Gill!</i>

01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:12.562
<i>Out of bounds. St. Vincent-St. Mary's</i>
<i>will have the basketball.</i>

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:18.809
<i>Close to the end of the first half</i>
<i>I was questioning, you know, myself.</i>

01:30:20.448 --> 01:30:25.147
<i>Three seconds left, Weems for three.</i>
<i>It does not fall.</i>

01:30:25.853 --> 01:30:29.550
<i>Alter has won the first half</i>
<i>of this basketball game,</i>

01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:31.655
<i>somewhat surprisingly.</i>

01:30:32.059 --> 01:30:36.189
<i>They have an 11-to-1 run</i>
<i>in the last four minutes and 10 seconds.</i>

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:41.061
Going into halftime losing, I'm thinking,
"Not again. Not two years in a row."

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:55.975
Fellas, it's not about
the X's and O's right now.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.348
It's not.

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:09.825
I want you guys to just, for one minute,
try to grasp this thing.

01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:14.733
You have an opportunity
that you guys have been given.

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:19.972
Now, look around the room, guys.
Hey, let's be real about this.

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:23.840
Some of these guys,
Dru, Bron, Sian, Rome, Willie,

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:27.179
you'll never play
another game of basketball.

01:31:28.182 --> 01:31:30.241
To be where you guys are at

01:31:30.518 --> 01:31:35.854
is just a blessing that you guys
will only understand later in life.

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:40.954
As this game winds on,

01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:47.625
some of you guys... Hey, this is
my last time coaching you, and...

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:56.870
There's been a lot of great times,
a lot of great memories,

01:31:58.212 --> 01:32:00.271
and I'm gonna cherish them.

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:08.979
But let's do this, fellas.

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:13.820
Just... You know, let's do this.
Let's end this thing the right way.

01:32:13.995 --> 01:32:15.758
- Let's go, man.
- Let's go!

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:16.921
- One, two, three.
- Team!

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:19.124
- Four, five, six.
- Work hard!

01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:25.198
<i>And my dad is just as big a piece</i>
<i>of this puzzle as any five of us.</i>

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:30.439
<i>This is a guy who was a football player</i>
<i>that changed to be a basketball coach.</i>

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:33.106
<i>When I told him this is what I want to do,</i>

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:35.614
he was the first person
to put the ball in my hand.

01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:41.646
<i>Joyce will take it in and Travis</i>
<i>scores at the three seconds, clock running.</i>

01:32:42.523 --> 01:32:45.321
<i>He was key for me</i>
<i>being the man I am today.</i>

01:32:45.459 --> 01:32:49.555
<i>If I wasn't at St. V with Coach Dru</i>
<i>pushing me toward the right thing,</i>

01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:52.796
God knows where I'd be right now.

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:57.337
<i>And he gets a steal,</i>
<i>after two free-throws comes the triple!</i>

01:32:57.872 --> 01:33:01.103
<i>Now he's starting making those...</i>
<i>Alter's in trouble.</i>

01:33:01.542 --> 01:33:05.239
<i>He helped me have that security</i>
<i>that I've always wanted in a father figure,</i>

01:33:05.346 --> 01:33:07.576
<i>and he didn't have to treat me</i>
<i>like I was one of his kids</i>

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:10.742
or buy things for me.
He didn't have to do it, but he did.

01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:13.115
<i>... out to James, they can take the lead.</i>

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:16.781
<i>James. Very nice!</i>

01:33:16.991 --> 01:33:19.289
It was always more than basketball
to Coach Dru.

01:33:19.393 --> 01:33:21.361
<i>He always wanted the best for us.</i>

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:25.330
<i>Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary's</i>
<i>spelling it out with 2:26 to go...</i>

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:29.665
We all looked at Coach Dru
as a father figure and loved him like that.

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:31.929
<i>6.3 seconds to go.</i>

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:37.199
<i>Forty-36. The Irish with the lead.</i>
<i>Pressure is on.</i>

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:41.713
<i>- Might be the ballgame.</i>
<i>- The ball... James gets the rebound!</i>

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:45.775
<i>He will dribble it out.</i>
<i>Joyce four seconds down the line.</i>

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:47.979
<i>And that's the basketball game!</i>

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:53.383
<i>Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary's</i>
<i>wins their third, in four years,</i>

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:56.986
<i>Division II state champions</i>
<i>here in Columbus.</i>

01:33:57.331 --> 01:34:01.199
<i>The Irish are your national champions!</i>

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:08.336
<i>Looking over and seeing my mom</i>
<i>and Coach Dru and Miss Joyce,</i>

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:11.707
<i>and everybody who had been there</i>
<i>from the beginning was there that day,</i>

01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:13.507
and it was just a dream come true.

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:18.145
<i>I felt like I did something, like, you know,</i>
<i>my life is now worth something.</i>

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:24.047
And winning it with my best friends,
one of the best feelings I ever felt in my life.

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:26.752
I just had to go find my brother
and hug him. You know what I am saying?

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:30.456
Because I could still be in Chicago
doing the wrong thing.

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:32.930
<i>I could be in jail, dead,</i>
<i>you know what I am saying?</i>

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:35.127
<i>He just led me in the right path.</i>

01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:37.529
It just seemed like everything
traced back to him.

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:41.732
<i>When we won that championship,</i>
<i>I just had to go find him.</i>

01:34:42.476 --> 01:34:47.937
Ran off the court and...
Twenty-thousand people and he found me,

01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:51.508
and we just embraced each other.

01:34:56.023 --> 01:34:59.754
<i>I felt like a proud father.</i>

01:35:01.996 --> 01:35:06.399
<i>I got to share that with my brothers</i>
<i>and also did that with my dad.</i>

01:35:06.867 --> 01:35:10.359
I got a chance to share my dream
with everybody I love.

01:35:12.206 --> 01:35:15.607
<i>We made a lot of sacrifices.</i>
<i>Not just me, other parents.</i>

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:20.909
<i>Sometimes I wonder if we took some</i>
<i>of the kids' childhood away from them,</i>

01:35:21.782 --> 01:35:26.116
<i>'cause they worked so hard.</i>
<i>They didn't hang out like a lot of kids.</i>

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:31.856
So sometimes you question,
"Did we do the right thing?"

01:35:49.643 --> 01:35:52.203
<i>I love them all like they're my sons.</i>

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:56.983
<i>God gave me an opportunity</i>
<i>to be involved with this,</i>

01:35:57.084 --> 01:36:01.612
<i>and it wasn't about basketball.</i>
<i>I needed to help them to become men,</i>

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:06.517
<i>that they're indebted to something</i>
<i>that's greater than themselves.</i>

01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:14.901
When I hugged him, I whispered in his ear,
"Don't ever give up on your dream.

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:16.435
"Look at me."

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:23.505
<i>I had to go a roundabout way</i>
<i>of finding my dream again.</i>

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:25.704
<i>For a while I had lost mine,</i>

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:29.948
and through working with that group,
I got it back.

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:38.587
<i>You just don't know</i>
<i>what life has in store for you.</i>

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:41.958
<i>And of course everyone wants to know,</i>
<i>"What is next,</i>

01:36:42.062 --> 01:36:44.257
<i>"or when are you going to decide?"</i>

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:46.890
<i>You know, it's so hard to think</i>
<i>about anything else right now</i>

01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:50.061
<i>besides being with my teammates</i>
<i>while we're still here in Columbus.</i>

01:36:50.171 --> 01:36:52.731
<i>And I'm just gonna try</i>
<i>to keep this in my head</i>

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.968
<i>as long as possible</i>
<i>and live out this last night.</i>

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:20.159
<i>LeBron James,</i>
<i>with no regard for human life,</i>

01:38:21.662 --> 01:38:24.893
<i>has given the Cavaliers</i>
<i>their biggest lead tonight!</i>

01:38:46.487 --> 01:38:49.752
Move your line out a little bit.
Move your line out.

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:52.724
It's gotta be full speed. Take the layup,

01:38:52.826 --> 01:38:55.192
and rebound from the front. Go for it.

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:59.888
Rebound. And go to the next guy in line.
Hurry up, hurry up, let's go.

01:39:08.075 --> 01:39:11.044
<i>Who's gonna be the first one to... All right!</i>
