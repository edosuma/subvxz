00:29.363 --> 00:30.629
Hi.

01:20.815 --> 01:23.048
- Hi, mom.
- Hey, sweetheart. Coffee?

01:23.084 --> 01:26.085
- Yes, please.
- Hey, Art. Hey, Kristie.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.321
All right, everyone,
quiet, please, quiet.

01:29.356 --> 01:32.091
Thank you.
Take your seats.

01:32.126 --> 01:36.940
Okay, now, the lovely Kristie
Simmons, our lawyer, is here

01:36.964 --> 01:40.266
to tell us how we will get that
much needed bike lane for our Town.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.301
Kristie?

01:46.273 --> 01:47.317
Good morning, everyone.

01:47.341 --> 01:51.977
Like most of you here,
I'm a life-long local, and I bike,

01:52.012 --> 01:55.314
so this goal is as important
to me as it is to all of you.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.850
Unfortunately, as you know,
the Bradley Beach Town board

01:57.885 --> 02:00.919
did reject our plan
for the bike lanes...

02:02.022 --> 02:02.921
I know.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.201
However, I have petitioned
the county court

02:04.225 --> 02:08.026
on the grounds that the Town has
failed to properly administer

02:08.062 --> 02:10.095
the safety of this community.

02:10.131 --> 02:13.031
So that means we'll be in
court tomorrow at 10:00 A.M.

02:13.067 --> 02:15.488
And we're going to fight this
thing, and we're going to win.

02:17.538 --> 02:21.151
Okay, tomorrow, we'll
show them we mean business.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.574
Yes.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.479
Hi, Art.

02:27.515 --> 02:28.413
Are you going
to be there tomorrow?

02:28.449 --> 02:30.227
The more press for our case
the better.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.028
As long as Barb keeps
making these cinnamon rolls,

02:32.052 --> 02:34.131
I'll make this case
"the telegram's" top story.

02:34.155 --> 02:36.455
Oh, so it's bribery, huh?

02:36.490 --> 02:38.401
Thanks for letting us
meet here, mom.

02:38.425 --> 02:41.338
Of course!
You know I love having big groups.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.962
Even if she makes everything
practically on the house.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.999
- Nothing wrong with that.
- Thank you, Daniel.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.700
What?

02:48.736 --> 02:51.403
Everyone shows community
support in different ways.

02:51.438 --> 02:53.305
Dad was right,
you have a very big heart,

02:53.340 --> 02:55.020
but you never were much
of a businesswoman.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.042
Says my darling daughter

02:57.077 --> 03:00.012
who does pro-bono work
every chance she gets.

03:00.047 --> 03:03.160
And thank goodness, she does, 'cause
we couldn't afford her otherwise.

03:03.184 --> 03:06.451
Hey, did you hear about the new
Town attorney the board brought in?

03:06.487 --> 03:09.666
- No, who'd they get?
- Some hotshot from Seattle.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.535
Dan put him up in his place.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.804
Apparently, he's only here until
they find a replacement for Ralph.

03:14.828 --> 03:17.629
Good luck to whoever they got
to finally take that job.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.731
I'm so glad you said no,

03:19.767 --> 03:22.234
even if your bank account
thinks otherwise.

03:22.269 --> 03:23.702
There's more to life...

03:23.737 --> 03:25.904
Which could be
the motto for our Town.

03:25.940 --> 03:27.639
Says my darling mother

03:27.675 --> 03:30.409
who spends all of her time
behind this counter.

03:30.444 --> 03:34.213
- You know I love it here.
- I know you do, it's just...

03:34.248 --> 03:35.681
What?

03:35.716 --> 03:38.383
You're about to lecture me...

03:38.419 --> 03:42.888
about how I should get out more
and enjoy life and take risks?

03:42.923 --> 03:46.336
Because you know I'm going to come
right back with the pot calling...

03:46.360 --> 03:47.759
- ... the kettle...
- I know.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.127
Exactly.

03:49.163 --> 03:53.532
- Bear claw, for Bill. His favorite.
- Thanks, mom.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.768
- Love you.
- You too.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.864
- Good morning.
- Hey, Kristie. Bill's in the back.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.533
Good, my mom
wanted me to bring him

04:16.557 --> 04:18.557
a couple of his favorite
bear claws.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.105
- Well, hello there.
- Hey, get back here, Gidget!

04:24.732 --> 04:27.466
- Hey you.
- Hi.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.102
- I see you've met Gidget.
- I have now.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.949
- Hello there.
- She's cute, right?

04:32.973 --> 04:34.451
She should have
been named Houdini.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.408
I don't know what
we're going to do with her.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.210
Do?

04:38.245 --> 04:39.211
Yeah, she's from
Argos Pet Rescue.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.124
Margie Dillahunt was
supposed to foster her,

04:41.148 --> 04:43.293
but her mother had
emergency knee surgery,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.228
and Margie had to go
back east to help out.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.830
She won't be back
for at least three weeks.

04:46.854 --> 04:50.400
- Who's taking her till then?
- Well, that is the big question.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.190
You know I would, but...

04:52.226 --> 04:53.892
But Buddy doesn't play well
with others, and I would but...

04:53.927 --> 04:56.461
Tiger and Ginger
won't allow dogs.

04:56.497 --> 05:00.432
I was thinking about asking
your mom, or maybe Delia?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.078
Although Mr. Whiskers
might object.

05:02.102 --> 05:05.137
Maybe Amy?
She loves causes.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.673
- She said before that she'd help if...
- I could take her.

05:12.046 --> 05:15.514
- You said three weeks, right?
- Well, maybe. I don't know exactly.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.149
I could do three weeks.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.620
- Are you sure?
- You have any other options?

05:22.556 --> 05:23.588
I do not.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.558
No, that would be
a huge help. Thank you.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.553
I didn't even
think of asking you.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.096
Who could resist this face?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.301
What do you think?

05:36.336 --> 05:39.771
This guy... Yeah?
You like this?

05:41.141 --> 05:43.041
Go get it!

05:43.076 --> 05:46.911
Good girl.
Come here.

05:49.249 --> 05:50.682
Good girl.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.490
Definitely.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.914
Looks like Gidget
hit the jackpot.

06:04.231 --> 06:07.298
This is gonna be expensive.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.935
Bill was in a pinch,
so I'm helping out.

06:14.341 --> 06:18.554
- Not until you fall in love.
- No, no, no.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.623
No, I don't fall
in love anymore.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.714
Does Bill know that?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.283
So, anything going on?

06:25.318 --> 06:27.163
Yes, there was a change
for tomorrow.

06:27.187 --> 06:31.690
We are now going to Judge Mays'
court instead of Judge Lee.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.825
Judge Mays is tough.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.272
Do you want me to make a call,
make a delay before I head out?

06:36.296 --> 06:41.900
No. No, I can handle tough.
Besides, we need this lane now.

06:46.373 --> 06:48.506
It would appear that...

06:48.542 --> 06:51.509
Miss Gidget would like
to go for a walk.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.982
Of course.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.092
Hey, Gidget!

07:07.627 --> 07:09.227
Simon!

07:14.101 --> 07:16.581
Simon, come on!

07:19.940 --> 07:22.085
Well, they are being pulled by the
tug of cupid's arrow, aren't they?

07:24.544 --> 07:27.045
Now's probably a good time
to mention she's spayed.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.848
Hey, responsible
dog owners for the win.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.254
Actually, I'm just fostering
for a few weeks.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.601
Oh, well, that's perfect 'cause
we're only here till mid-February.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.626
I just moved in,
just down the way.

07:41.495 --> 07:45.029
Yeah, we should,
arrange some play dates.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.531
Play dates?

07:46.566 --> 07:48.806
Play dates, they're not just
for humans anymore.

07:48.835 --> 07:51.936
I'm Keith.
Simon.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.803
Kristie.
Gidget.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.924
And regrettably,
I do have to take this.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.681
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.328
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.496
Hello?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.086
Gidget!

08:09.089 --> 08:10.529
I just moved,
like, in an hour ago...

08:11.691 --> 08:14.592
Come on, Gidget!
Come on, Gidge...

08:14.628 --> 08:17.629
Yeah, no, it's nice here.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.979
I bet I know who you want
to be your Valentine, huh?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.569
Handsome Simon?

08:27.440 --> 08:30.341
- Hello!
- Hey, mom!

08:30.377 --> 08:33.812
- What are you doing here?
- I just had to see her.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.982
She is adorable!

08:38.018 --> 08:40.852
Yeah, that's
her survival mechanism.

08:40.886 --> 08:44.200
- It's working.
- I know.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.858
I broke my "no more
pets" rule because of it.

08:46.893 --> 08:47.792
I don't understand that rule.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.862
You always had plenty
of pets growing up.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.998
- Remember Noodles the cat?
- Yeah, why did I name him that?

08:54.034 --> 08:57.502
You were three. Your father
thought it was adorable.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.642
You know, it's Valentine's day
in a few weeks.

09:05.512 --> 09:08.540
Have you thought any more about
signing up for a dating site?

09:09.616 --> 09:11.216
I will if you will.

09:12.853 --> 09:13.853
I'm dating Bill.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.388
- What is that look?
- What...

09:17.424 --> 09:20.692
The look is that
I think the world of Bill.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.972
He's a wonderful
veterinarian,

09:22.996 --> 09:25.363
and exactly who you needed
when you left Chicago

09:25.398 --> 09:27.332
and "he who shall not be named".

09:27.367 --> 09:30.735
- But it's been two years.
- I like Bill. We get along.

09:30.770 --> 09:34.016
Well, I like Bill, and we get
along, but we're not dating.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.006
- Oh!
- What?

09:35.041 --> 09:36.474
I forgot to give him
the bear claw.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.479
No, in my defense,
I had just gotten this one.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.782
- She can be a bit of a handful.
- How so?

09:43.817 --> 09:45.394
Apparently,
she's an escape artist.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.833
She already bolted earlier when
I was taking her for a walk.

09:49.689 --> 09:52.724
I can't really blame her.
Simon is adorable.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.859
- Simon?
- Cute dog.

09:54.895 --> 09:58.149
She took one look at him and
fell in love at first sight.

09:58.531 --> 10:02.433
Well, it's always nice
to make new friends.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.706
Here's one.

10:10.143 --> 10:13.578
Wow, hot.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.648
Must be the new
Town counsel's car.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.082
"Law one"?

10:18.118 --> 10:21.600
Great.
He's that guy.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.703
Right...

10:38.738 --> 10:41.039
I'm gonna go back to the office.
This is for you.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.151
Okay, I'll call you later to discuss.

10:42.175 --> 10:45.087
Okay, sounds good.
Call me on my cell.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.987
- Gidget.
- Simon.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.758
You know, this isn't the kind
of play date I had in mind.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.430
- I'm sorry, you know him?
- I'll tell you later.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.101
It is a delight

11:10.136 --> 11:13.438
to see so many of Bradley
Beach's citizens in attendance.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.807
We're here today
to hear oral arguments

11:15.842 --> 11:18.876
with regards to the petition
of the shore bicycle Club

11:18.912 --> 11:21.346
verses the Town of Bradley Beach

11:21.381 --> 11:24.148
concerning the creation
of a bicycle lane.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.551
Ms. Simmons represents
the petitioner.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.687
- Counselor?
- Thank you, your honor.

11:29.723 --> 11:30.788
Ordinance 243

11:30.824 --> 11:33.391
of the incorporated Town of
Bradley Beach, to paraphrase,

11:33.426 --> 11:35.004
states that one purpose
of the Town board

11:35.028 --> 11:36.973
is to pass laws
for its citizens' safety.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.464
The denial of the petitioners'
request for a bike lane

11:39.499 --> 11:43.301
creates a situation directly
contrary to the law's purpose.

11:48.675 --> 11:52.176
All right, quiet, please.
Mr. Amos, I believe?

11:53.125 --> 11:55.013
It is.
And good morning, your honor.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.225
May I compliment
opposing counsel

11:56.249 --> 11:58.783
on the brief and lucid way
in which she stated her case.

11:58.818 --> 12:00.551
Sweet-talker.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.832
However, the same ordinance
Ms. Simmons referenced

12:02.856 --> 12:05.801
goes on to state that any
such laws passed by the board

12:05.825 --> 12:08.960
are also for the convenience
of its citizens.

12:08.995 --> 12:12.208
Creation of a bicycle lane would
eliminate 200 parking spaces,

12:12.232 --> 12:14.465
which would be a major
inconvenience for the merchants,

12:14.501 --> 12:18.736
and a limit to access for the tourists,
upon whom the businesses depend.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.005
Right, point taken.
Ms. Simmons?

12:21.041 --> 12:23.252
Yes, it's those tourists
we're thinking of, your honor.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.622
They also bike, and shop, and
have to weave around moving cars.

12:26.646 --> 12:29.547
Now, no parking spaces
would have to be eliminated

12:29.582 --> 12:32.228
if we just removed the present
median from the center of main street

12:32.252 --> 12:36.154
per the traffic feasibility
study admitted as exhibit 1.A.

12:36.189 --> 12:39.035
- Couldn't that be done, Counselor?
- Certainly, your honor.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.937
We could eliminate the median.
We could also eliminate the sidewalks,

12:41.961 --> 12:43.806
and while we're at it, why not
eliminate the stores, too?

12:43.830 --> 12:46.108
Objection, your honor.
Counsel is being facetious.

12:46.132 --> 12:49.200
I noticed that.
Overruled.

12:49.235 --> 12:50.235
Continue, Mr. Amos.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.280
Under petitioners' logic,

12:51.304 --> 12:54.439
if we force the Town
to create a bicycle lane,

12:54.474 --> 12:55.618
then why not a jogging lane?

12:55.642 --> 12:57.219
Or a skating lane,
or a lane for surfers?

12:57.243 --> 13:00.545
- Or for power-walkers... -
That is ridiculous, your honor.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.092
And for the record, we don't
consider this request to be a joke.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.226
Our citizen's safety is at stake.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.596
I'm just taking the Counselor's argument
to its ultimate conclusion, your honor.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.520
Don't be smug.

13:12.158 --> 13:13.369
You've made your point, Counselor.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.793
However, my courtroom
is not the place

13:15.829 --> 13:17.840
for you to practice
your stand-up routine.

13:17.864 --> 13:21.899
Now, I will take both of your
arguments under advisement.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.435
We are adjourned.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.159
- Unbelievable.
- Right?

13:33.546 --> 13:35.413
Hey, Dan.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.986
You know,
you're the enemy now.

13:42.956 --> 13:47.303
Hey, I'm your realtor, not your relative.
I don't need to sugar-coat it for you.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.894
Come on, Dan, I'm doing my
job, it's nothing personal.

13:49.929 --> 13:52.108
Yeah, not for you,
you'll be back in Seattle.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.899
The rest of us will be up here
dodging buses and suvs.

13:54.934 --> 13:57.668
Would it help if I
bought you a steak dinner?

13:57.704 --> 14:00.104
Yeah, it might.

14:01.541 --> 14:05.276
Hold that thought.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.547
Thank you.
It was nice seeing you. Bye.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.694
Hey, Counselor,
how about a coffee?

14:11.718 --> 14:13.784
- How about never?
- I prefer coffee.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.531
I prefer not being mocked
in front of the judge.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.867
Mere chitchat between dog owners.

14:17.891 --> 14:20.769
Come on, let's have a coffee
and make peace.

14:20.793 --> 14:23.161
I'd rather have
an herbal tea and a hot bath.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.463
Seems a little advanced
for our relationship.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.531
Funny.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.646
Look, I just thought that as long as
we're going to be working together...

14:30.670 --> 14:32.982
We are not working together.
We are adversaries.

14:33.006 --> 14:33.971
Adversaries.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.351
Or didn't they teach you that
in law school?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.608
Some of my best friends
are my adversaries.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.455
That might be your problem.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.157
I think you're getting me
all wrong here...

14:41.181 --> 14:44.894
Your license plate says "law one".
I think I'm getting you all right.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.062
- Okay, about that...
- Tell Simon I said hello.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.246
And his owner,
"I'll see you in court".

14:55.061 --> 14:57.695
Excuse me.

15:16.849 --> 15:20.851
Gidget...
You're lucky you're cute.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.190
Hang on a second.
Come here, come here.

15:35.134 --> 15:36.734
Seriously, Gidge?

15:36.769 --> 15:40.271
Sorry, girl, we're gonna
go see grandma instead.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.376
All right, come on.

15:45.411 --> 15:48.779
I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.

15:55.321 --> 15:58.889
If you having a dog means
I get to see you for breakfast,

15:58.925 --> 16:00.858
I should've talked you
into this a while ago.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.394
Come on.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.033
So, I heard about
the new Town attorney.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.601
Sounds like a handful.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.938
Just the usual
career-fixated narcissist

16:13.973 --> 16:16.207
who happens to have
a really cute dog.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.809
- He brought his dog to court?
- No.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.345
Turns out,
he's Simon's owner.

16:21.381 --> 16:24.582
- Gidget's Valentine?
- Ex... ex-Valentine.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.630
There's no way I'm allowing
a doggie play date now.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.599
His owner reminds me of the guys
I went to law school with in Chicago.

16:30.623 --> 16:31.756
The guys?

16:31.791 --> 16:34.103
Or that one guy in particular
that you broke up with?

16:34.127 --> 16:39.130
He broke up with me by dating
the senior partner's daughter.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.399
- I was trying to skip that part.
- Thank you.

16:41.434 --> 16:45.569
And yeah, sort of.
I mean, they both drive porsches.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.572
I always wanted a Porsche.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.176
What? They're fun cars.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.423
The sun in your face,
the wind in your hair...

16:55.715 --> 16:56.947
Come on, Gidge.

16:56.983 --> 17:01.986
We're going for a jog before
we catch a mid-life crisis.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.333
Come on, Gidge.

17:22.675 --> 17:27.511
Those crazy kids, you
just can't keep them apart.

17:29.815 --> 17:33.984
You know, you were right the other day.
I was out of line.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.155
- What?
- No, I'm just looking for the catch.

17:38.190 --> 17:40.691
No, no, no catch.
Just sincerity.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.093
We can agree
to disagree, can't we?

17:43.129 --> 17:46.397
- We can.
- Great.

17:46.432 --> 17:49.800
Maybe we could even reboot?

17:49.835 --> 17:51.635
Hi, I'm Keith.
I'm a lawyer from Seattle,

17:51.671 --> 17:55.105
but I used to live near Bradley
Beach when I was younger,

17:55.141 --> 17:58.854
and recently got the chance and do
legal counsel for the Town board.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.390
How about you? Did you
grow up around here?

18:01.414 --> 18:03.925
- Taft high school.
- Bishop Carlyle.

18:03.949 --> 18:06.884
- You guys had a better football team.
- True.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.320
- Have coffee with me.
- I'm dating someone.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.322
- I know.
- You... How do you know?

18:12.358 --> 18:13.635
I spoke to Dan Carlyle.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.638
And you have my word
that this will be

18:16.662 --> 18:19.830
a strictly professional
coffee chat.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.944
We could even discuss settling
the whole bicycle lane matter.

18:22.968 --> 18:26.737
- "Settling?"
- Magic word.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.873
- All right.
- Excellent.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.311
Tomorrow.
Noon.

18:34.346 --> 18:35.390
Beach cafe.

18:35.414 --> 18:38.015
- I'm bringing Simon...
- I'm bringing Gidget.

18:38.050 --> 18:41.385
I'm quitting while I'm ahead.
See you tomorrow.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.020
Simon!

18:43.055 --> 18:44.688
Come on, Gidget!

18:45.558 --> 18:48.192
Hey... here you go.
Good boy.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.372
Hi. Hi. Come on. Come on,
let's go home. Come on...

18:50.396 --> 18:53.363
Gidget! Come on!

18:53.399 --> 18:56.900
Good girl.
Good girl... come on.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.902
Come on! Come on.

19:07.148 --> 19:10.082
- Hey-o!
- Hey, Bill.

19:10.117 --> 19:14.019
Delia.
Hey, let me help you with that.

19:14.054 --> 19:14.853
Thank you.

19:15.956 --> 19:18.735
And here I thought you only went
all-out for Christmas and Halloween.

19:18.759 --> 19:21.293
No, I treat all holidays equally.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.606
Well, that's very
progressive of you.

19:22.630 --> 19:25.108
She's not here, she's
with her mom at the cafe,

19:25.132 --> 19:26.543
but she should be
back soon.

19:26.567 --> 19:28.167
Okay.

19:28.202 --> 19:31.136
- Did you bring the treats?
- I did.

19:31.172 --> 19:33.105
- Dog biscuits.
- Yum.

19:33.140 --> 19:35.340
- For Gidget.
- You don't say.

19:35.376 --> 19:37.120
Oh, and this...
Is for Mr. Whiskers.

19:37.912 --> 19:40.078
10% off his next
teeth cleaning.

19:43.951 --> 19:46.618
No offense, but if this is
my only Valentine's day gift,

19:46.654 --> 19:48.820
I think I am going to give up.

19:50.758 --> 19:53.158
You know what, just...
Just tell her I stopped by.

19:53.194 --> 19:54.159
Sure thing.

19:54.195 --> 19:56.489
Thanks, Delia.
And it really does look great.

20:00.634 --> 20:04.836
Honey, it's not that bad, and
besides, the bit about Delia's dress

20:04.872 --> 20:06.238
was kind of cute.

20:06.273 --> 20:09.441
Keith sounds like a rock star.
I sound like a total amateur.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.944
- No more free Danish for Art.
- Yes, ma'am.

20:11.979 --> 20:14.613
- And who's Keith?
- Town attorney guy.

20:14.648 --> 20:17.149
Yesterday he was
a career-fixated narcissist,

20:17.184 --> 20:18.762
and today,
he's just Keith?

20:18.786 --> 20:20.297
We ran into each other
at the Beach.

20:20.321 --> 20:24.356
I swear, Gidget has an internal homing
beacon where his dog is concerned.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.325
Anyway.

20:27.828 --> 20:29.928
What is... that?

20:29.964 --> 20:33.098
How did those get there?

20:39.406 --> 20:41.974
"Coffee and your smile
make my day, every day".

20:42.009 --> 20:43.909
It's not signed.

20:43.944 --> 20:47.012
Does my mother
have a secret admirer?

20:47.047 --> 20:50.182
- Don't be silly.
- You do, don't you?

20:50.217 --> 20:53.785
No, it's probably someone else's,
and they accidentally left it there.

20:53.821 --> 20:55.254
It says "Barb".

20:55.289 --> 20:58.156
- Well, maybe it's another Barb.
- In your cafe?

20:58.192 --> 21:00.437
Talking about your coffee, every day.

21:00.461 --> 21:02.427
It's someone
who comes here every day.

21:02.463 --> 21:05.697
- Everyone comes here every day.
- Good point.

21:05.733 --> 21:09.982
Well, whoever it is, this is exciting.
Right?

21:11.538 --> 21:13.672
I don't know.

21:20.214 --> 21:23.415
We're a community that prides
itself on its active lifestyle.

21:23.450 --> 21:27.386
Even you, who's been here for,
like, a nanosecond should see that.

21:27.421 --> 21:29.988
Okay, well, one of my
jobs as Town attorney

21:30.024 --> 21:33.659
is to advise the board on whether
an action is worth pursuing.

21:33.694 --> 21:36.561
A bike lane would cost a
fortune for a Town this size.

21:36.597 --> 21:40.399
For what, 50 cyclists?
It's not worth that alone.

21:40.434 --> 21:42.601
What if there were more?

21:43.671 --> 21:45.991
How many cyclists can a Town
like Bradley Beach have?

21:47.141 --> 21:50.442
So, you didn't really ask me
here to talk about settling.

21:51.645 --> 21:54.357
I may have been a little flippant
before, but you can see my point.

21:54.381 --> 21:57.716
I see you think my only
objection was to your tone.

21:57.751 --> 22:00.919
- There were other objections?
- Plenty.

22:00.954 --> 22:02.532
Your arrogance just
got added to the list.

22:02.556 --> 22:03.889
I am not arrogant.

22:03.924 --> 22:05.368
- Kinda. Little bit.
- No.

22:05.392 --> 22:08.093
But as it happens,
you've given me an idea.

22:08.128 --> 22:10.128
- I did?
- Yeah.

22:10.164 --> 22:12.578
Thanks, Counselor.
Come on, Gidge.

22:15.135 --> 22:17.375
Am I going
to like this idea?

22:30.150 --> 22:34.986
Collecting signatures seems
like, um, a lot of walking.

22:35.022 --> 22:37.556
You go out dancing every
weekend at the Goodman Club.

22:37.591 --> 22:39.091
You can handle it.

22:39.126 --> 22:40.670
Funny you should mention dancing.

22:40.694 --> 22:44.896
Bill was here before, I think
he noticed the invitation.

22:44.932 --> 22:46.098
Invitation?

22:46.133 --> 22:48.700
The Bar Association
charity dinner dance?

22:48.736 --> 22:50.035
Have you asked him to go yet?

22:50.070 --> 22:51.981
No, I'm not even sure
if I want to go.

22:52.005 --> 22:54.406
Besides, he hates dancing
just as much as I do.

22:54.441 --> 22:57.175
He's the one that told me
about the Goodman Club.

22:57.211 --> 22:58.510
Really?

22:58.545 --> 23:01.179
He just stopped asking you to go
because you kept saying no.

23:03.484 --> 23:06.485
Ask Bill to the dance.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.721
Okay.
But first...

23:11.191 --> 23:13.392
Go, go.

23:13.427 --> 23:15.227
Thank you.

23:15.262 --> 23:17.763
We need all the support
we can get.

23:17.798 --> 23:21.433
And, um, here you go.
In case you change your mind.

23:21.468 --> 23:24.570
We've got great support
right now. We just need more.

23:24.605 --> 23:26.304
There you go. Okay.

23:29.643 --> 23:32.010
Petitioning for
new bike lanes in our Town.

23:32.045 --> 23:33.345
It's a great cause.

23:33.380 --> 23:35.881
I have one for you.
Here you go.

23:35.916 --> 23:38.076
Hi. Will you support
our bike lane proposal?

23:40.554 --> 23:41.554
Hey...

23:43.357 --> 23:45.056
Hi. Hi there.

23:45.092 --> 23:47.036
If you just want
to put your name...

23:47.060 --> 23:48.994
Thanks so much.

23:49.029 --> 23:51.997
Okay... there you go.
Sign right here.

23:52.032 --> 23:54.132
With the courts permission,
your honor,

23:54.168 --> 23:56.246
I'd like to add
an addendum to my pleadings.

23:56.270 --> 23:57.836
I'm listening.

23:57.871 --> 24:00.705
And I'd like to thank the
opposing counsel for this idea.

24:00.741 --> 24:03.508
Since Mr. Amos mentioned
creating special lanes

24:03.544 --> 24:06.578
for other recreational
activities besides biking,

24:06.613 --> 24:10.282
I've collected a petition
signed by an additional 200 people,

24:10.317 --> 24:12.684
plus letters in support
of the creation

24:12.719 --> 24:16.688
of a multipurpose lane
for all activities.

24:21.228 --> 24:23.094
Quiet, please.

24:23.875 --> 24:25.862
Any objections, Counselor?

24:27.568 --> 24:30.602
- None, your honor.
- All right.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.605
I will read over the addendum
to consider making this change

24:33.640 --> 24:37.042
and let you know my decision
in a couple of days.

24:38.378 --> 24:40.946
Your move, law one.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.886
It's fabulous, honey.

24:47.921 --> 24:49.421
Nice write-up.

24:49.456 --> 24:51.868
Does this mean I can go back
to giving Art free pastries?

24:51.892 --> 24:52.858
Please?

24:52.893 --> 24:54.137
You're back
in the Danish, Art.

24:54.161 --> 24:55.961
Yes...

24:55.996 --> 24:57.596
There's Bill.

25:03.403 --> 25:05.403
- Hey!
- Hey.

25:05.439 --> 25:07.405
I've been meaning to talk to you
about the Bar Association dance.

25:07.441 --> 25:10.976
Oh, right.
I'm afraid I can't make it.

25:11.011 --> 25:14.646
- Because you hate dancing.
- What? No! I love dancing.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.926
- Really?
- Yeah. No, I can't make it

25:16.950 --> 25:18.127
because it's great
aunt Linda's birthday,

25:18.151 --> 25:19.729
and I have to drive out
to Marysville.

25:19.753 --> 25:22.754
- You're not upset, are you?
- No, of course not.

25:22.789 --> 25:24.200
I'm not sure
if I'm even going.

25:24.224 --> 25:26.336
Well, you can always
come with me if you like.

25:27.661 --> 25:30.929
- I'd like to say that's tempting...
- But you'd be totally lying?

25:30.964 --> 25:32.964
It's okay, it's okay, I get it.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.812
But hey, we're still on for dinner
Friday night, right?

25:35.836 --> 25:37.802
- We are.
- Great.

25:37.838 --> 25:39.358
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.386
- Hey.
- Hey!

25:43.410 --> 25:45.755
Better get in there quick.
Only one bear claw left.

25:45.779 --> 25:49.014
Thanks for the tip.
Don't know why I did that.

26:01.662 --> 26:05.196
- And hello, Counselor.
- Hello, Counselor.

26:06.099 --> 26:10.502
- I have a question, what is this?
- You didn't read it?

26:10.537 --> 26:13.471
- I don't know how.
- You're funny.

26:13.507 --> 26:15.373
Land dispute.

26:15.409 --> 26:19.122
A Mrs. Agnes Pittman used
to own this whole area.

26:19.146 --> 26:22.058
She used to say she kept it like
this because she loved the views,

26:22.082 --> 26:25.728
and the whole nature preserve
part was just a happy result.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.486
Everyone knew she wanted
to leave this to the Town,

26:28.522 --> 26:32.290
but sadly, she died before
transferring it into a trust,

26:32.326 --> 26:34.671
and now her heir has
sold it to a developer.

26:34.695 --> 26:38.063
Who, I'm sure, are going to
leave it as-is for society's sake.

26:39.099 --> 26:41.032
So, another lawsuit?

26:41.068 --> 26:43.846
Either that, or everything
you see will be high-rises.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.838
That would be a shame.
It's really beautiful here.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.540
It really is.

26:48.575 --> 26:51.921
Have you gotten a chance
to get out and explore a little?

26:51.945 --> 26:54.412
- Do some hiking?
- A little.

26:54.448 --> 26:57.048
I'd forgotten how much
I missed the views here

26:57.084 --> 27:00.485
and the quiet,
which is especially nice.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.420
I've just been so focused
on my career lately.

27:02.456 --> 27:05.023
Define "lately".

27:05.058 --> 27:08.660
Pretty much since
graduating law school.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.996
That's a long "lately".

27:11.031 --> 27:14.199
Well, you put your nose to
the grindstone, you lose track.

27:14.234 --> 27:16.901
Yeah, but then
all you see is grindstone.

27:16.937 --> 27:19.638
Look up.
Better view, huh?

27:19.673 --> 27:21.439
Much.

27:23.276 --> 27:26.811
- How long have you had him?
- A couple of years.

27:26.847 --> 27:30.181
He belonged to an ex who got a job in
Australia and couldn't take him with her.

27:30.217 --> 27:31.716
Is she coming back?

27:31.752 --> 27:36.788
She married a guy after she
got there, so probably not.

27:36.823 --> 27:39.491
Okay.
I get it.

27:39.526 --> 27:42.861
- What?
- I've had my heart broken, too.

27:42.896 --> 27:46.598
- Really?
- Jeff from Chicago.

27:46.633 --> 27:49.901
You guys would like each other,
actually. He also drives a Porsche.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.569
Okay, I should explain.

27:51.605 --> 27:55.807
The car belonged to my late uncle
Bruce, and I was going to sell it...

27:55.842 --> 27:58.309
But have you ever driven
one of those?

27:58.345 --> 27:59.789
No, but feel free
to give my mom a ride.

27:59.813 --> 28:01.079
She'd thank you forever.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.781
Mental note taken.

28:02.816 --> 28:05.450
But, really, if you ever
want to take a spin...

28:05.485 --> 28:07.752
I gotta go,
I'm meeting Delia for dinner.

28:08.989 --> 28:10.422
Gidge?

28:10.457 --> 28:11.890
Simon!

28:11.925 --> 28:12.891
Simon, come on!

28:12.926 --> 28:16.494
Hey, Simon, come on.
Come on, boy, come here.

28:16.530 --> 28:17.810
Come on.

28:19.166 --> 28:22.067
- Hey, Simon, come here, buddy.
- Good girl...

28:26.173 --> 28:27.984
- Okay, if we just...
- Turn the other way!

28:28.008 --> 28:30.353
Um, I'm trying.
You-you just...

28:30.377 --> 28:32.010
Gidget, just...
Well, turn the other way.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.945
- Simon...
- Hello.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.192
Hey, folks, good to see you.

28:36.216 --> 28:37.749
You have a good day.

28:38.985 --> 28:39.918
Okay, just...

28:39.953 --> 28:41.873
- Turn the other way.
- I'm trying.

28:45.026 --> 28:46.893
Chocolates!

28:46.928 --> 28:48.939
I found them at the door
when I opened this morning.

28:48.963 --> 28:51.163
He's definitely interested.

28:51.199 --> 28:54.734
- They're my favorites.
- Who could they be from?

28:54.769 --> 28:57.503
Who would be interested in me?

28:57.539 --> 29:01.841
Hey, no...
Don't do that.

29:01.876 --> 29:03.576
Well... it's been a long time.

29:04.579 --> 29:06.279
Ten years.

29:07.348 --> 29:09.560
I've just assumed
this part of my life was over,

29:09.584 --> 29:12.418
and I don't know what to expect.

29:13.621 --> 29:15.633
Well, maybe don't have
any expectations.

29:15.657 --> 29:17.924
Just...

29:17.959 --> 29:21.894
Let it be what it'll be,
go from there.

29:27.035 --> 29:30.136
Simon enjoyed seeing
Gidget yesterday.

29:30.171 --> 29:33.706
- How about tonight?
- I have dinner plans, thanks.

29:33.741 --> 29:34.785
Tomorrow night?

29:34.809 --> 29:36.776
Simon and Gidget aren't the
only ones who can be dogged.

29:36.811 --> 29:39.745
- That was a terrible pun.
- I got a million of 'em.

29:39.781 --> 29:40.901
You're not
helping your case.

29:42.150 --> 29:44.417
Sure about that?

29:46.854 --> 29:48.732
You two look like
you're enjoying yourselves.

29:48.756 --> 29:50.000
Are you going to let us in
on the joke?

29:50.024 --> 29:54.160
Just a dog owner joke, your honor.
Not that interesting.

29:54.195 --> 29:57.563
All right, I have had
a chance to review

29:57.599 --> 29:59.932
the motion to accept
the new petition,

29:59.968 --> 30:01.934
and it looks sound to me.

30:01.970 --> 30:05.137
Mr. Amos, any objection

30:05.173 --> 30:07.251
to the addendum
expanding the bike lane

30:07.275 --> 30:09.108
to include additional
sporting activities?

30:09.143 --> 30:11.811
None, your honor.

30:11.846 --> 30:15.915
Then I will accept the motion, and
it will be entered into the record.

30:15.950 --> 30:18.986
We will resume the hearing on this
matter on Thursday as scheduled.

30:35.003 --> 30:38.771
- So, this is nice, huh?
- It's lovely.

30:44.512 --> 30:47.079
I heard they have
a new bolognese recipe.

30:49.417 --> 30:50.883
I'm thinking the salmon.

30:51.819 --> 30:52.899
Always a safe choice.

30:59.427 --> 31:02.928
- Did you order champagne?
- No, I thought you did.

31:02.964 --> 31:05.698
I did not.
I wonder who?

31:10.505 --> 31:12.405
Keith.

31:13.608 --> 31:15.041
Keith? Who's Keith?

31:15.076 --> 31:16.742
The Town attorney
I told you about.

31:17.679 --> 31:19.145
Thank you.

31:21.349 --> 31:23.827
That's funny, I was
picturing someone...

31:23.851 --> 31:25.084
Older.

31:29.624 --> 31:31.435
Do you think
you could stop flirting,

31:31.459 --> 31:33.937
and get down to the reason
I asked you out tonight?

31:33.961 --> 31:35.728
I am just being polite
to a colleague.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.775
Is that what they're
calling it these days?

31:37.799 --> 31:41.033
We are battling each other in
a very important case right now.

31:41.069 --> 31:43.402
About a bike lane.

31:43.438 --> 31:45.171
I'm here in Mayberry by the sea

31:45.206 --> 31:48.007
to talk to you about something
that's actually important.

31:48.042 --> 31:49.942
Your future with the firm?

31:51.312 --> 31:53.390
Yes, I thought that would
get your attention.

31:53.414 --> 31:57.717
- Is there some sort of problem?
- The exact opposite.

31:57.752 --> 32:01.060
The partners like that you've
been brought in as an advisor here.

32:02.256 --> 32:05.124
It was smart to take
that position.

32:05.159 --> 32:07.927
That was the general idea.

32:08.930 --> 32:12.965
There are some things brewing with
some property the firm represents.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.546
Nothing concrete just yet,
but this little bike path...

32:15.570 --> 32:17.581
Lane.
It's a bike lane.

32:17.605 --> 32:20.606
Whatever.
... bike thing you have going on

32:20.641 --> 32:23.375
could put you in position
for something a lot bigger,

32:23.411 --> 32:25.611
and I know bigger is your goal.

32:26.848 --> 32:29.982
- I'm intrigued.
- Good.

32:30.017 --> 32:31.283
We want you to be.

32:34.822 --> 32:37.056
Who do you think she is?

32:38.092 --> 32:40.326
I don't know,
probably his girlfriend.

32:40.361 --> 32:42.321
No, he doesn't have a girlfriend.

32:43.498 --> 32:44.797
How do you know that?

32:46.300 --> 32:49.969
Well, they just, I don't know,
they don't seem like a couple to me.

32:55.510 --> 32:57.243
Clearly.

33:11.893 --> 33:14.361
- Thanks for the champagne.
- My pleasure.

33:14.395 --> 33:17.329
- Hope you enjoyed it.
- We did.

33:17.365 --> 33:18.709
Did you and your date
enjoy dinner?

33:18.733 --> 33:21.500
It wasn't a date,
we just work together.

33:24.472 --> 33:28.352
In fact, here she is. Laura
Presley, this is Kristie Simmons.

33:28.376 --> 33:30.609
My associate
and my opposing counsel.

33:30.645 --> 33:32.311
- Hello.
- Hello.

33:32.346 --> 33:34.780
I hear you've been keeping
our legal beagle on his toes.

33:34.816 --> 33:36.093
So far.

33:36.117 --> 33:39.885
Well, don't wear out the boy.
Our firm has big plans for him.

33:42.523 --> 33:44.056
Well, good night.

33:45.359 --> 33:47.799
I'll see you in court.

33:48.596 --> 33:49.995
Shall we?

33:50.031 --> 33:51.730
Yes.

34:00.141 --> 34:01.207
Found it.

34:02.210 --> 34:03.375
My scarf.

34:03.411 --> 34:05.578
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

34:09.917 --> 34:11.050
Good morning.

34:11.085 --> 34:14.652
I will now hear oral arguments
on the plaintiff's motion

34:14.688 --> 34:18.591
regarding the creation
of a recreational lane.

34:18.626 --> 34:19.891
Ms. Simmons?

34:21.295 --> 34:24.196
Your honor, citing the case
of Ogden versus Illinois,

34:24.232 --> 34:27.233
the 2nd circuit ruled in favor
of a community swimming pool

34:27.268 --> 34:30.112
over the state's right to develop
the land for business purposes.

34:30.137 --> 34:33.516
With respect, your honor, Ogden
was overturned by the 9th circuit,

34:33.541 --> 34:36.420
stating that tax revenue supersedes
the community's use of the land

34:36.444 --> 34:38.277
for recreational purposes.

34:38.312 --> 34:39.590
Which was modified
by the 10th circuit,

34:39.614 --> 34:41.625
stating property taken
in eminent domain

34:41.649 --> 34:43.659
was set aside in order to build
a community hospital.

34:43.684 --> 34:46.619
- A bike lane is not a hospital.
- Recreational lane.

34:46.654 --> 34:48.532
And neither is a swimming pool,
but the same principle applies.

34:48.556 --> 34:52.291
Not it's used solely for recreational
purposes, which a hospital clearly is not.

34:54.228 --> 34:57.196
- Rebuttal, Counselor?
- Well, I'd say...

34:58.666 --> 35:00.711
Yes. Yes, state of Maine
verses Brewster,

35:00.735 --> 35:04.637
where a recreational lane took
precedence over a waterfront mall.

35:04.672 --> 35:06.939
Mr. Amos?

35:06.974 --> 35:09.074
But it was remanded
to a lower court.

35:09.110 --> 35:11.411
Where it was upheld...
Six to two.

35:15.650 --> 35:17.149
All right. Quiet, please.

35:19.387 --> 35:20.786
Good work, Counselors.

35:20.821 --> 35:25.224
I will take your arguments
under consideration,

35:25.259 --> 35:27.293
and will rule on the matter shortly.

35:31.132 --> 35:32.598
Quite a performance, Counselor.

35:32.633 --> 35:35.534
Back atcha, Counselor.

35:35.569 --> 35:38.282
Will I be seeing you at the
Bar Association dinner tonight?

35:38.306 --> 35:39.939
I haven't decided yet.

35:39.974 --> 35:42.474
Come on, you have to go.
Bring your boyfriend.

35:42.510 --> 35:44.343
He can't make it.

35:44.378 --> 35:47.791
That doesn't mean you can't go.
It is great for networking.

35:47.815 --> 35:51.283
I head up a committee that does
pro bono work for returning vets,

35:51.319 --> 35:53.439
and we could really use
somebody like you.

35:54.689 --> 35:55.988
What?

35:56.023 --> 35:59.491
You... you just surprised me,
that's all.

36:00.461 --> 36:03.963
I got as many good surprises
as I do bad puns.

36:19.413 --> 36:20.413
Yeah, me neither.

36:21.716 --> 36:23.248
No.

36:23.284 --> 36:24.783
Okay.

36:38.132 --> 36:39.932
What did I ever do without you?

36:58.753 --> 37:02.621
Why do they always hold these
things near Valentine's day?

37:02.656 --> 37:05.491
It's so...
Red and white.

37:06.927 --> 37:10.529
- Looking for bike path girl?
- Bike lane.

37:10.564 --> 37:12.498
It's an important distinction.

37:12.533 --> 37:14.466
And what makes you think...

37:22.410 --> 37:23.509
Excuse me.

37:28.049 --> 37:30.482
You came.

37:30.518 --> 37:32.451
I did.

37:32.486 --> 37:35.788
And you look beautiful.

37:37.158 --> 37:38.991
Thank you.

37:39.026 --> 37:42.661
- You clean up nicely yourself.
- Thanks.

37:42.696 --> 37:45.776
And I feel compelled to point out
that I do have other good points.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.310
- You do?
- I do.

37:47.334 --> 37:50.502
I'm also a very good dancer.
Shall we?

37:50.538 --> 37:51.937
Kristie?

37:51.972 --> 37:53.338
Jeff?

37:53.374 --> 37:55.374
Hey...

37:55.409 --> 37:56.809
What are you doing here?

37:56.844 --> 37:58.188
I could've sworn
I left you in Chicago.

37:58.212 --> 38:00.612
I moved back
to Seattle last year.

38:00.648 --> 38:02.381
Well, you remember
Todd Donally, right?

38:02.416 --> 38:05.184
Right, good old Todd.

38:05.219 --> 38:06.363
He's right over here,
do you want to come say hi?

38:06.387 --> 38:09.555
Not remotely.
How's, Tiffany?

38:11.058 --> 38:12.591
We, broke up.

38:12.626 --> 38:15.627
She married one of the partners
in the firm, so...

38:15.663 --> 38:20.199
- That's a shame.
- But you look... amazing.

38:20.234 --> 38:22.301
Doesn't she?

38:23.537 --> 38:24.570
Do you have a moment?

38:24.605 --> 38:27.372
I think they're playing
our song. Is that our song?

38:27.408 --> 38:29.186
Yes, that is our song.

38:29.210 --> 38:31.143
Since when does
Kristie Simmons dance?

38:31.178 --> 38:33.679
Since she found
the right partner.

38:38.119 --> 38:41.620
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:41.655 --> 38:44.423
That was weird, right?

38:44.458 --> 38:45.902
I had something like that happen.

38:45.926 --> 38:49.161
I've been to Australia
exactly once in my life,

38:49.196 --> 38:52.843
for a three-day conference in Sydney
last year, and I ran into Julia twice.

38:52.867 --> 38:55.134
Were you okay?

38:55.169 --> 38:56.835
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, as far as I'm concerned,

38:56.871 --> 38:59.519
I got the better end
of the deal getting Simon.

39:01.742 --> 39:04.109
I think so, too.

39:29.336 --> 39:33.116
Okay, so, my spies in the
Seattle attorney scene tell me

39:33.140 --> 39:35.641
that Jeff is with
Harrison, Biddle, and Smith,

39:35.676 --> 39:39.625
which means he has a bright
future in tax litigation.

39:40.848 --> 39:44.583
I can't believe I let that guy
have so much power over me.

39:44.618 --> 39:47.319
I mean, that guy
broke my heart?

39:47.354 --> 39:49.254
Was it me, or was he wearing
a lot of Cologne?

39:49.290 --> 39:51.730
Rolled off him like a fog.

39:52.593 --> 39:53.837
Okay, so he's still hovering.

39:53.861 --> 39:56.173
You want me to give you two space
so you can tell him everything

39:56.197 --> 39:58.341
you've been dreaming about
saying these last...?

39:58.365 --> 40:00.933
Two years?
No. Don't you dare.

40:00.968 --> 40:02.267
This is perfect.

40:02.303 --> 40:04.414
Yeah? There's no
emotional hangover?

40:04.438 --> 40:05.237
Anything like that?

40:05.272 --> 40:07.306
No. No, there's
no emotional anything.

40:07.341 --> 40:10.008
I feel so much lighter.
It's like I'm free.

40:10.044 --> 40:11.577
Good.

40:14.949 --> 40:19.017
- Your date's not happy, though.
- I don't have a date.

40:19.053 --> 40:21.086
Does she know that?

40:22.489 --> 40:25.624
Yes, she does.

40:25.659 --> 40:28.193
Any interest in me
is strictly business.

40:28.229 --> 40:31.096
No, no, Ms. Simmons,
the man you see in front of you

40:31.131 --> 40:36.034
- is 100% date-free.
- I find that very hard to believe.

40:36.070 --> 40:37.350
Right?

40:40.007 --> 40:45.377
But there is one woman,
who's smart and funny...

40:45.412 --> 40:47.613
Keeps me on my toes.

40:47.648 --> 40:49.192
- Really?
- Definitely.

40:49.216 --> 40:51.583
And I send her a million hints,

40:51.619 --> 40:54.886
and she just keeps
shooting me down.

40:54.922 --> 40:57.889
Well, she must have her reasons.

40:59.059 --> 41:00.192
Maybe.

41:07.701 --> 41:09.735
I should go.

41:14.008 --> 41:15.207
Thank you.

41:15.242 --> 41:18.510
- For tonight.
- Of course.

41:19.780 --> 41:21.880
Okay.
I'm gonna...

41:21.915 --> 41:23.850
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:43.070 --> 41:46.004
Look what I got.
And... red roses.

41:46.040 --> 41:47.372
Again.

41:47.408 --> 41:49.386
Well, this is next-level.

41:49.410 --> 41:50.754
How do you feel
about meeting him?

41:50.778 --> 41:53.111
Well, part of me
wants to say yes

41:53.147 --> 41:54.457
just so I can find out who it is.

41:54.481 --> 41:58.183
The other part wants to
hide away where it's safe.

41:58.218 --> 42:01.620
- Yeah, I get that.
- I know you do.

42:02.656 --> 42:03.689
Big sigh.

42:04.958 --> 42:06.858
How was tonight?

42:07.928 --> 42:09.695
Interesting.

42:09.730 --> 42:12.064
Revelatory.

42:12.099 --> 42:13.598
Disconcerting.

42:13.634 --> 42:15.934
All that in two hours?

42:15.969 --> 42:20.038
Keith was there.
And so was Jeff.

42:20.074 --> 42:23.436
Holy smokes.
This calls for chocolate.

42:25.946 --> 42:27.546
Hey, where's Gidge?

42:29.016 --> 42:30.315
Gidget?

42:30.351 --> 42:31.616
Gidget...

42:31.652 --> 42:32.818
Gidge!

42:34.822 --> 42:36.254
That little Houdini.

42:45.099 --> 42:46.565
Hey. What's going on?

42:46.600 --> 42:49.167
- Hi. Is Gidget here?
- Gidget? No.

42:49.203 --> 42:51.147
She's missing.
I've looked everywhere.

42:51.171 --> 42:53.605
I thought maybe she came here
to be with Simon.

42:53.640 --> 42:54.673
Now that you mention it,

42:54.708 --> 42:56.675
I haven't seen Simon
since I got home.

42:56.710 --> 42:58.276
Simon!

42:59.646 --> 43:01.313
Gidget!

43:01.348 --> 43:02.514
Simon!

43:03.517 --> 43:04.883
Simon!

43:04.918 --> 43:06.451
Gidge!

43:08.689 --> 43:09.833
Simon!

43:09.857 --> 43:11.356
Gidget!

43:12.559 --> 43:15.160
Where could they have gone?

43:16.363 --> 43:17.929
The Beach.

43:21.771 --> 43:23.036
Gidget!

43:24.774 --> 43:27.174
Come here, girl!

43:27.209 --> 43:28.976
Come on, Gidge!

43:29.011 --> 43:30.077
Simon!

43:31.380 --> 43:32.946
It's so dark.

43:32.982 --> 43:36.016
- Do you hear anything?
- No.

43:36.051 --> 43:37.818
Wait...

43:39.422 --> 43:41.855
Sorry about this.

43:41.891 --> 43:46.059
Bill warned me
she's an escape artist.

43:47.062 --> 43:49.163
Wait, wait.
I think I hear something.

43:49.198 --> 43:50.164
Gidget?

43:50.199 --> 43:51.932
Gidget!

43:51.967 --> 43:53.678
- Simon, come here, boy!
- Come on! Come here!

43:53.702 --> 43:55.102
Come on, Simon!
Come on, Simon!

43:56.205 --> 43:57.171
Gidge!

43:57.206 --> 43:58.105
Come on, boy,
come on, Simon!

43:58.140 --> 43:59.140
Gidget!

43:59.175 --> 44:01.375
Come on, Simon!
Come on, buddy, come on!

44:02.478 --> 44:05.279
Yeah, good boy.
Come here, Simon.

44:05.314 --> 44:06.580
Good girl.

44:09.485 --> 44:11.129
All right, buddy, come on.

44:11.153 --> 44:15.055
I'm going to text my mom that we found
her before she calls half the Town.

44:18.961 --> 44:20.427
It's so beautiful here.

44:21.864 --> 44:24.998
More of the non-grindstone world.

44:28.103 --> 44:31.071
This is one of my favorite views.

44:31.106 --> 44:35.509
Although, it'll all be gone
if the developers get their way.

44:35.544 --> 44:38.111
Condos as far
as the eye can see.

44:38.147 --> 44:41.748
That would be awful.

44:41.784 --> 44:45.919
Well, at least you don't need
to be here to worry about it.

44:45.954 --> 44:50.690
You'd be surprised how quickly a
person can get attached when it's right.

44:52.327 --> 44:54.127
I don't know,
you seem like the kind of guy

44:54.163 --> 44:58.131
who adjusts well
to wherever you go.

44:58.167 --> 45:03.069
You'll probably forget about us
your first day back to city life.

45:03.105 --> 45:05.372
What if I don't?

45:05.407 --> 45:07.874
- Don't what?
- Go back to city life.

45:07.910 --> 45:09.087
Wait...

45:09.111 --> 45:13.580
Are you thinking
about staying here?

45:13.615 --> 45:18.585
- I haven't figured it out yet.
- What about your career?

45:18.620 --> 45:21.488
Don't get me wrong,
I love it here,

45:21.523 --> 45:24.758
but I'm not trying to climb
any sort of corporate ladder.

45:24.793 --> 45:30.697
My career has eaten up so
much of my life at this point,

45:30.732 --> 45:32.143
but right now,
sitting here with you,

45:32.167 --> 45:35.135
I can't imagine why.

45:45.681 --> 45:47.659
It's late. We should go.

46:00.128 --> 46:02.028
Must be the lifeguard.

46:03.031 --> 46:04.464
Kristie!

46:05.334 --> 46:07.100
Mom?

46:07.135 --> 46:08.568
Thank goodness.

46:08.604 --> 46:09.970
Hi!

46:10.005 --> 46:13.607
Keith Amos, this is
my mother, Barb Simmons.

46:13.642 --> 46:16.710
Mom, this is Keith.
And Simon.

46:16.745 --> 46:20.513
Well, it's very nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

46:20.549 --> 46:24.128
I am terrified now.
For me, not Simon.

46:24.152 --> 46:27.988
He always gets good reviews,
tonight's little caper notwithstanding.

46:28.023 --> 46:28.889
Not to worry.

46:28.924 --> 46:30.535
I can make up my own mind
about people.

46:31.994 --> 46:34.995
No, I mean, I haven't
said that much.

46:35.030 --> 46:38.732
- Do you want me to remind you?
- No need.

46:38.767 --> 46:41.868
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Keith.

46:41.904 --> 46:43.637
Come on.

46:43.672 --> 46:47.160
Come on.
Come on, Simon, let's go.

46:48.911 --> 46:52.579
Keith, thank you.
For everything.

46:52.614 --> 46:54.147
You're welcome.

46:56.752 --> 46:57.752
Okay...

47:02.124 --> 47:03.723
What a long night.

47:03.759 --> 47:07.727
Well, you got to spend more time
with Keith, and that's a good thing.

47:07.763 --> 47:10.730
What? No.
No, he's the enemy.

47:11.700 --> 47:15.502
You were standing awfully close
to the enemy when I pulled up.

47:15.537 --> 47:17.570
You saw that?

47:17.606 --> 47:20.206
I'm your mother.
I see everything.

47:21.310 --> 47:23.677
You're going
to have to talk to Bill.

47:25.080 --> 47:26.313
Nothing happened.

47:26.348 --> 47:28.581
That's not why you need to
talk to him, and you know it.

47:30.185 --> 47:31.618
I made a decision, too.

47:31.653 --> 47:34.721
I'm going to meet
my secret admirer.

47:37.559 --> 47:39.961
What harm can come, right?
It's just a date.

47:39.995 --> 47:41.528
Exactly.

47:42.497 --> 47:45.932
So why do I feel so guilty?

47:45.968 --> 47:47.248
Mom...

47:48.103 --> 47:50.470
You know dad would've
wanted you to be happy.

47:50.505 --> 47:53.039
I am happy.

47:53.075 --> 47:56.042
With the cafe, with my friends,
and you.

47:56.078 --> 47:57.777
I know.

47:57.813 --> 48:00.714
I know, but now you have a chance
at a different kind of happy.

48:02.117 --> 48:04.784
Who knows if anything
would even come of it, right?

48:04.820 --> 48:06.753
It's probably just Stan Gumpski,

48:06.788 --> 48:09.456
wanting me for his next
pyramid scheme.

48:09.491 --> 48:12.058
Or maybe
he's a really nice guy.

48:13.662 --> 48:15.462
Wouldn't that be something.

49:07.416 --> 49:09.549
Okay, Simon, let's go.
Come on...

49:41.983 --> 49:45.418
And I couldn't believe that Jeff tried to
invite me to his table to see his friends.

49:45.454 --> 49:49.189
I've never been so happy to
see Keith Amos in my life.

49:49.224 --> 49:52.092
So Keith was there?

49:52.127 --> 49:55.628
Well, yeah, along with a
couple hundred other lawyers.

49:55.664 --> 49:58.698
But, you and Keith,
you saw each other.

49:59.968 --> 50:03.269
Did you...
Dance together?

50:03.305 --> 50:06.005
Yeah, just as a way
to deal with Jeff.

50:07.409 --> 50:12.212
But that does bring up a point
I want to talk to you about.

50:12.247 --> 50:13.113
You're...

50:13.148 --> 50:14.559
- You're blushing.
- What?

50:14.583 --> 50:16.761
Your cheeks, they're all red,
and you're, like, nervous.

50:16.785 --> 50:17.951
No, no...

50:19.387 --> 50:23.123
See, the thing is...

50:24.159 --> 50:27.794
- You like him. Keith.
- No, it's not about that.

50:27.829 --> 50:29.929
- It's okay.
- It isn't.

50:29.965 --> 50:33.066
No, actually...

50:33.101 --> 50:35.034
Actually, it is okay.

50:36.771 --> 50:39.706
Wait, are... are you
about to break up with me?

50:39.741 --> 50:43.143
Weren't you just
about to do the same to me?

50:45.914 --> 50:49.382
Yeah... I guess I was.

50:49.417 --> 50:50.428
The thing is, I...

50:50.452 --> 50:53.486
I should have been jealous
about you and Keith.

50:53.522 --> 50:54.654
Nothing happened...

50:54.689 --> 50:58.291
I believe you, I do,
but still...

50:58.326 --> 50:59.993
You weren't jealous.

51:01.696 --> 51:05.532
You know, Kris, I think I just
had all these, like, expectations

51:05.567 --> 51:07.145
about what our relationship
should be

51:07.169 --> 51:10.603
that I never really noticed
they weren't there.

51:10.639 --> 51:13.926
But lately, it's been kind
of obvious, don't you think?

51:15.544 --> 51:18.789
Look, I know that Valentine's
is just a couple days away.

51:18.813 --> 51:20.591
We could wait until after,
if you want.

51:20.615 --> 51:25.285
- You know, fake it for the holidays.
- Do you want to do that?

51:25.320 --> 51:28.454
No. Do you?

51:28.490 --> 51:30.590
No.

51:37.365 --> 51:40.333
I almost forgot, one more thing.

51:40.368 --> 51:43.480
Margie is coming back a couple
days early to pick up Gidget.

51:44.673 --> 51:47.307
- How early?
- The 14th.

51:54.649 --> 51:56.816
Bear claw?

51:58.220 --> 51:59.385
Yeah.

52:17.240 --> 52:20.207
- Hey, Barb.
- Hey, Keith.

52:21.577 --> 52:23.978
And how is Daniel doing today?

52:24.013 --> 52:27.526
I had a nice 20-mile bike ride this
morning, so I'm feeling pretty good.

52:27.550 --> 52:29.316
20 miles?
Good grief.

52:29.352 --> 52:30.662
Yeah, you should try it sometime.

52:30.686 --> 52:32.686
Thanks, I'll stick to jogging.

52:32.722 --> 52:33.621
Well, that's why
you don't understand

52:33.656 --> 52:37.224
why we're fighting the Town
board so hard to get our lane.

52:37.260 --> 52:39.894
It really means a lot, doesn't it?

52:39.929 --> 52:42.141
Well, we're a small
community, Keith,

52:42.165 --> 52:46.033
and small things here tend to
seem bigger from our perspective.

52:48.771 --> 52:54.642
When I was growing up nearby, my
parents once spent an entire summer

52:54.677 --> 52:57.589
fighting to have traffic lights
installed at a busy intersection

52:57.613 --> 52:59.046
to make it safer.

53:02.585 --> 53:04.485
I had forgotten about that.

53:04.520 --> 53:05.800
Well...

53:09.959 --> 53:13.561
- Hey, how did it go?
- He went first.

53:13.596 --> 53:17.598
It turns out pretty much everyone knew
we shouldn't be dating, including Bill.

53:17.633 --> 53:22.369
He's a good man, and someday, the
right woman is going to find him.

53:23.573 --> 53:25.617
And someday,
the right man will find you,

53:25.641 --> 53:27.601
who will make
your heart flutter.

53:28.144 --> 53:30.177
Bill and I just broke up
an hour ago.

53:30.213 --> 53:31.078
I didn't say anything.

53:31.114 --> 53:33.347
You have very expressive eyes.

53:33.382 --> 53:34.515
So...?

53:34.550 --> 53:37.918
So he doesn't live here
and his career is in Seattle.

53:37.954 --> 53:40.766
Oh, sweetie, people
change plans all the time.

53:40.790 --> 53:44.303
Well, speaking of plans...
Are you ready to begin?

53:44.327 --> 53:48.095
Just how much prep time
do you think I require?

53:49.499 --> 53:51.819
Let me see if Amy needs me.

53:58.774 --> 54:01.375
- Hi.
- Hello.

54:03.079 --> 54:06.780
- Where's Simon?
- Doggie day care.

54:06.816 --> 54:08.293
It's a great place,
you should check it out.

54:08.317 --> 54:13.354
Well... Gidget's foster
mom is coming back early, so...

54:16.192 --> 54:18.659
You know, I used to think
that having a dog

54:18.694 --> 54:21.095
would too big
of a responsibility.

54:21.130 --> 54:25.366
I was a single guy with a busy career,
and then Simon fell into my lap,

54:25.401 --> 54:29.303
with his big brown eyes and
undeniable charm, and voila.

54:31.599 --> 54:36.810
What I'm saying is, if you really
want something, there's always a way.

54:46.389 --> 54:47.509
Don't.

54:49.525 --> 54:52.005
Let's just get started.

54:55.698 --> 54:57.932
What do you think?

55:01.337 --> 55:02.703
You look beautiful.

55:05.408 --> 55:06.852
I'm so proud of you
for doing this.

55:08.277 --> 55:10.611
I'm scared to death.

55:10.646 --> 55:12.479
It's such a big unknown.

55:13.616 --> 55:14.848
It's about to be known.

55:17.687 --> 55:18.819
Your turn next.

55:20.256 --> 55:22.496
One step at a time, lady.

55:24.927 --> 55:26.207
Perfect.

55:30.533 --> 55:33.100
Just please don't let it be
Stan Gumpski.

55:56.459 --> 56:01.161
- Hello.
- Dan?

56:05.868 --> 56:09.069
I hope you like champagne.

56:09.105 --> 56:10.504
I do.

56:10.539 --> 56:11.579
Good.

56:16.612 --> 56:18.045
Dan...

56:19.582 --> 56:23.228
- They make a cute couple.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

56:23.252 --> 56:25.552
I wanted to see
how it was going.

56:25.588 --> 56:29.089
Dan was so nervous,
the poor guy.

56:29.125 --> 56:30.405
Wait, you knew?

56:32.094 --> 56:33.272
Did you help?

56:33.296 --> 56:35.262
I may have made a few
suggestions here and there.

56:36.999 --> 56:39.767
He's liked your mom for so long,

56:39.802 --> 56:42.936
but he didn't know if she would be
willing to go out with anyone at all,

56:42.972 --> 56:46.907
- so I suggested...
- Secret admirer.

56:46.942 --> 56:48.876
So he could test the waters.

56:48.911 --> 56:51.779
Plus, it's crazy romantic,
don't you think?

56:56.952 --> 56:58.152
To surprises.

56:58.666 --> 57:00.087
To surprises.

57:01.123 --> 57:04.258
Come on, let's give
these kids some space.

57:07.129 --> 57:09.229
Okay.

57:33.189 --> 57:35.422
I'm fine. I'm fine...

57:40.296 --> 57:44.598
Dan Gibbons.
Who knew he was so romantic?

57:44.633 --> 57:46.978
Just when you think you've
got someone all figured out.

57:47.002 --> 57:49.837
You wouldn't happen to be talking
about Dan's accomplice, now, would you?

57:49.872 --> 57:53.707
No, no, no, no, we are focusing
on you and your amazing night.

57:53.743 --> 57:55.309
It really was.

57:55.344 --> 57:57.144
I haven't felt like that in a long time.

57:57.179 --> 57:59.333
Aw, so I take it there's
going to be a second date?

58:00.649 --> 58:03.684
We're going to drive to Seattle
to see the "Holiday Inn" revival.

58:03.719 --> 58:07.287
Turns out Dan likes
old musicals as much as I do.

58:07.323 --> 58:10.491
- Go, Dan.
- Hey, and thank Keith for me.

58:10.526 --> 58:13.460
Sometimes, all it takes
is a little nudge.

58:13.496 --> 58:16.830
Subtle.

58:19.201 --> 58:20.481
There you are.

58:21.504 --> 58:24.037
Hey, what a surprise.

58:24.073 --> 58:27.441
- You've been ignoring my calls.
- I've been swamped.

58:27.476 --> 58:29.877
Our favorite bike lane case
is coming to a close.

58:29.912 --> 58:30.944
Finally.

58:30.980 --> 58:33.781
I need your attention
on a new matter.

58:33.816 --> 58:36.228
Remember I told you about
a property our firm represents?

58:37.386 --> 58:41.688
Well, it's right here in Bradley
Beach, right along the water.

58:41.724 --> 58:44.691
- The Pittman property?
- You know it?

58:44.727 --> 58:46.093
It's an amazing piece of land.

58:46.128 --> 58:50.197
And our new client,
Maxon Securities, now owns it.

58:50.232 --> 58:53.100
They want to create a gated,
high-end development.

58:53.135 --> 58:57.271
- Condos.
- Very lucrative condos.

58:57.306 --> 59:03.043
We're fairly certain the board will
zone it our way, with your help.

59:03.078 --> 59:06.113
I don't know about that.
I'm still pretty new here.

59:06.148 --> 59:07.993
Yes, well, they asked
for you specifically.

59:08.017 --> 59:09.716
You're a local boy made good,

59:09.752 --> 59:11.530
and they're hungry
for the tax base.

59:11.554 --> 59:14.021
With your guidance,
we can fast-track it.

59:14.056 --> 59:15.456
Keith...

59:15.491 --> 59:18.058
This could be the chance
you've been working for.

59:18.093 --> 59:22.196
Whatever it is that's
making you hesitate, stop it.

59:22.231 --> 59:25.365
Opportunities like this are rare.

59:32.175 --> 59:36.110
I think it's bold you ended things
with Bill before Valentine's day.

59:36.146 --> 59:39.080
You could come with me
and my cousins.

59:39.115 --> 59:43.129
The Goodman Club is having this singles
dance to celebrate the holiday, and...

59:43.153 --> 59:46.501
I just got depressed by
the end of that sentence.

59:46.623 --> 59:50.692
Thanks, but my mom has her annual
valentines party that night.

59:50.727 --> 59:54.340
You don't mind
if I still use Bill as a vet, right?

59:54.364 --> 59:55.808
I mean, I could take Mr. Whiskers

59:55.832 --> 59:56.664
to Valley Pine, but...

59:56.700 --> 59:59.901
No, no, of course, you'll still
use Bill, he's a great vet.

59:59.936 --> 01:00:02.637
And he's a great guy,
he's just not... my great guy.

01:00:07.143 --> 01:00:10.044
Kristie Simmons' office.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.948
Yes.
Of course.

01:00:14.884 --> 01:00:17.986
Judge Mays has called session in
for tomorrow morning.

01:00:28.098 --> 01:00:29.597
Good morning.

01:00:29.633 --> 01:00:32.867
We are here in the matter
of the shore bike Club

01:00:32.902 --> 01:00:35.003
versus the Town
of Bradley Beach.

01:00:35.038 --> 01:00:37.405
Counselor, you requested
this special session?

01:00:38.908 --> 01:00:40.408
Yes, your honor.

01:00:40.443 --> 01:00:42.977
In the matter of creating
the recreational bike lane,

01:00:43.013 --> 01:00:47.915
the Town of Bradley Beach wishes to retract
its objections to the plaintiff's suit,

01:00:47.951 --> 01:00:50.111
and concedes the argument
to the plaintiff.

01:00:52.856 --> 01:00:55.890
Didn't expect that.
Okay then.

01:00:55.925 --> 01:00:59.961
Judgment is rendered
in favor of the plaintiff.

01:00:59.996 --> 01:01:04.744
The Town will complete a plan
for the recreational lanes in question

01:01:04.768 --> 01:01:08.403
to be submitted to me within
60 days. Court is adjourned.

01:01:11.307 --> 01:01:15.343
Oh, my gosh!
We won.

01:01:24.621 --> 01:01:27.555
It was tough, but we did it.

01:01:32.762 --> 01:01:33.961
Hey...

01:01:33.997 --> 01:01:35.037
Hey.

01:01:36.032 --> 01:01:38.099
How did that happen?

01:01:38.134 --> 01:01:40.702
The board called me in
for an update,

01:01:40.737 --> 01:01:42.615
I told them what I thought
their chances were,

01:01:42.639 --> 01:01:43.716
and they got the message.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.873
That must have been
some message.

01:01:45.909 --> 01:01:48.943
I calls 'em like I sees 'em.

01:01:51.347 --> 01:01:55.049
We're all heading over to my
place for a little celebration,

01:01:55.085 --> 01:01:57.552
so maybe if you want to join...

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:02.724
That sounds nice, I'd love that.

01:02:05.361 --> 01:02:09.464
...and remind everyone we still have
the Pittman property to deal with.

01:02:09.499 --> 01:02:11.677
Let's just celebrate
this victory for now.

01:02:11.701 --> 01:02:12.734
I agree.

01:02:15.071 --> 01:02:16.638
Mom, you didn't
have to make all this.

01:02:16.673 --> 01:02:19.374
You have your Valentine's
celebration in three days.

01:02:19.409 --> 01:02:22.688
Honey, you know perfectly well
that when I'm happy, I cook.

01:02:22.712 --> 01:02:24.012
It's in my DNA.

01:02:24.047 --> 01:02:26.815
Why don't you go
soak up the accolades?

01:02:29.553 --> 01:02:30.618
Hello. This is Keith.

01:02:31.721 --> 01:02:34.022
Yeah, hold on. Hold on a sec.

01:02:37.327 --> 01:02:39.127
Sorry, we're just celebrating

01:02:39.162 --> 01:02:41.663
the end of the famous
recreational lane case.

01:02:41.698 --> 01:02:44.332
- We conceded, by the way.
- Really?

01:02:44.367 --> 01:02:46.401
The winning side
usually celebrates.

01:02:46.436 --> 01:02:47.802
<i>I'm celebrating with them.</i>

01:02:47.838 --> 01:02:50.705
Along with the plaintiff's
attorney, I'll bet.

01:02:51.808 --> 01:02:53.341
She's good at her job.

01:02:53.376 --> 01:02:55.087
<i>Yes, I'm sure
that's the attraction.</i>

01:02:55.111 --> 01:02:57.056
<i>Now, have you spoken
with the board yet?</i>

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.213
From what I hear,

01:02:58.248 --> 01:03:00.915
Councilman Snyder is the one
member you have to persuade.

01:03:00.951 --> 01:03:02.562
The others typically
follow his lead.

01:03:02.586 --> 01:03:04.085
No, I...

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.262
I've got to run.
I'll call you back.

01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:08.823
<i>Keith? Keith!</i>

01:03:11.127 --> 01:03:14.128
- Everything okay?
- Everything's roses.

01:03:14.164 --> 01:03:15.274
Hey, I got an idea.

01:03:15.298 --> 01:03:18.644
Why don't you and I go out to
celebrate your illustrious victory?

01:03:18.668 --> 01:03:21.180
- You and I?
- Yeah, it's an old legal tradition.

01:03:21.204 --> 01:03:23.771
Two former adversaries get
together and smoke a peace pipe.

01:03:23.807 --> 01:03:27.920
Any refusal will be appealed
to the state supreme court.

01:03:27.944 --> 01:03:29.544
So...

01:03:31.114 --> 01:03:32.547
Sounds good.

01:03:32.582 --> 01:03:36.784
- Was that an affirmative response?
- I think it was.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.653
I almost don't know what to do
with that, it feels so foreign.

01:03:38.688 --> 01:03:40.054
I can say "no" if you'd rather.

01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:41.267
- No, no.
- No?

01:03:41.291 --> 01:03:42.291
I mean, yes!

01:03:43.727 --> 01:03:48.930
Say "yes", and I will learn to
deal with the lack of opposition.

01:03:50.133 --> 01:03:51.065
So...

01:03:51.101 --> 01:03:53.535
Is it finally a date?

01:03:54.504 --> 01:03:56.938
This is finally a date.

01:04:05.248 --> 01:04:07.115
Michael...

01:04:08.485 --> 01:04:10.718
Yeah, a little scoop
for "The Telegram".

01:04:10.754 --> 01:04:13.655
Well, I have it
on good authority that...

01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:15.223
Well, Keith Amos, in fact...

01:04:15.258 --> 01:04:19.661
That the board is going to side with
the developers on the Pittman property.

01:04:19.696 --> 01:04:23.131
Absolutely.
You can take it to print.

01:04:27.637 --> 01:04:29.270
Okay...

01:04:29.306 --> 01:04:33.853
Well, I am happy to report that
Mr. Whiskers' teeth are in great shape.

01:04:33.877 --> 01:04:37.445
Sadly, that is
the highlight of my day.

01:04:38.615 --> 01:04:40.515
I am, however, going
to recommend some new food

01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:42.951
to help him lose
a couple extra pounds.

01:04:42.986 --> 01:04:44.786
Got any suggestions for me?

01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:47.455
What are you talking about?
You look great.

01:04:50.193 --> 01:04:53.595
I mean, not-not-not that I...
Have been looking...

01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:56.831
I mean, I have,
as a human, standing in...

01:04:56.866 --> 01:04:59.635
I can see that you're,
you know...

01:04:59.669 --> 01:05:01.937
- You're blushing.
- Am I?

01:05:01.972 --> 01:05:03.204
It's cute.

01:05:03.239 --> 01:05:05.251
I mean, I'm not...
I'm not calling you cute!

01:05:05.275 --> 01:05:06.341
Of course.

01:05:06.376 --> 01:05:09.811
I mean, you are...
Empirically... cute.

01:05:09.846 --> 01:05:11.479
Thank you.

01:05:12.616 --> 01:05:14.382
Okay.

01:05:15.318 --> 01:05:16.318
Bye.

01:05:30.233 --> 01:05:31.499
Hello?

01:05:31.534 --> 01:05:35.703
<i>Do you prefer Italian...
California fusion, or Sushi?</i>

01:05:35.739 --> 01:05:38.206
Italian.
Always Italian.

01:05:38.241 --> 01:05:41.376
<i>And Valentino's it is.
For tonight.</i>

01:05:41.411 --> 01:05:44.223
But I think, to be fair we should try
all the other restaurants

01:05:44.247 --> 01:05:45.725
before we come
to our ultimate decision

01:05:45.749 --> 01:05:47.593
on which is the best
in Bradley Beach.

01:05:47.617 --> 01:05:51.486
<i>And then we move on to the other
areas, and then to the state.</i>

01:05:51.521 --> 01:05:53.254
And then we expand beyond that.

01:05:53.289 --> 01:05:56.258
I like that plan.
See you soon.

01:05:56.292 --> 01:05:58.026
I look forward to it.

01:05:58.061 --> 01:05:59.761
Me too.

01:06:08.238 --> 01:06:09.170
<i>Hello?</i>

01:06:09.205 --> 01:06:10.905
Hey, Dan, you got a sec?

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.274
Sure. What's up?

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:19.811
I wanted your advice on maybe
getting a place that's a little more...

01:06:20.183 --> 01:06:21.482
Long-term.

01:06:21.518 --> 01:06:26.254
We'll send the depositions
tomorrow, overnight them.

01:06:26.289 --> 01:06:28.134
And you may as well tell me
what's on your mind,

01:06:28.158 --> 01:06:31.592
because I'm going to get it
out of you one way or another.

01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:39.300
How... broken up
are you and Bill?

01:06:40.603 --> 01:06:42.403
Very. Why?

01:06:42.439 --> 01:06:45.940
Well, it's just...
Yeah... is that...

01:06:45.975 --> 01:06:49.377
- It's a funny story.
- Okay.

01:06:49.412 --> 01:06:51.279
Is, um... I was, um...

01:06:52.282 --> 01:06:54.415
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:06:54.451 --> 01:06:57.251
- Bear claw.
- The best.

01:07:00.023 --> 01:07:01.923
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:07:01.958 --> 01:07:02.958
So... okay.

01:07:11.634 --> 01:07:13.735
I have no explanation.

01:07:13.770 --> 01:07:15.903
It was like a... Like a...

01:07:15.939 --> 01:07:17.505
A lightning bolt out of the blue,

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:20.074
in seriously the least
romantic place imaginable,

01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:24.746
and for the record, nothing
happened. Zero. Zilch. Nada.

01:07:24.781 --> 01:07:27.381
- But you'd like for it to.
- What?

01:07:27.417 --> 01:07:29.851
- No.
- I mean...

01:07:29.886 --> 01:07:33.187
Only if you're...

01:07:33.223 --> 01:07:34.522
Okay with it.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:40.128
I could not be
more okay with it.

01:07:41.064 --> 01:07:43.598
- Really.
- Really?

01:07:45.001 --> 01:07:47.279
In fact, it's probably
a good time for me to admit

01:07:47.303 --> 01:07:48.603
that Keith and I...

01:07:48.638 --> 01:07:52.907
Keith Amos is the worst!
He's siding with the developers.

01:07:52.942 --> 01:07:55.143
What is it?

01:08:02.987 --> 01:08:04.854
Hey, come on in.

01:08:04.889 --> 01:08:07.323
I thought I was the one
picking you up.

01:08:08.159 --> 01:08:09.658
What's going on?

01:08:11.562 --> 01:08:12.695
Hold on.

01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:14.441
That makes us adversaries.
Again.

01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:16.477
I haven't given the board
my recommendation.

01:08:16.501 --> 01:08:17.711
Then how did it get in the paper?

01:08:17.734 --> 01:08:19.546
I don't know, maybe
Laura jumped the gun...

01:08:19.569 --> 01:08:21.180
Because she knew
that was the plan, right?

01:08:21.205 --> 01:08:23.850
There is no plan, Kristie.
I haven't come to a conclusion yet.

01:08:23.875 --> 01:08:26.653
Keith, there's only one conclusion,
I thought you understood that.

01:08:26.676 --> 01:08:29.545
I thought you understood
this place. I thought...

01:08:31.215 --> 01:08:33.260
And for the sake of complete
clarity, the date is off.

01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:34.461
Tonight and all future nights.

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:35.685
Kristie...

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.852
Hey...

01:08:50.935 --> 01:08:55.938
I know, boy, I'm sorry.
I feel the same way.

01:08:57.942 --> 01:08:59.219
Looks like
I'm going to have to do more

01:08:59.243 --> 01:09:01.877
than talk my way outta this one.

01:09:21.165 --> 01:09:23.432
Not today, girl.
Different direction.

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:38.680
Come here, Simon, come on.

01:10:03.307 --> 01:10:06.509
You see, Gidge, this is what happens
when I let go of expectations.

01:10:06.544 --> 01:10:07.544
I get hurt.

01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:09.022
You know why we have
expectations.

01:10:09.046 --> 01:10:12.515
Because we have the experience
that allows us to anticipate results.

01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:15.696
So, you know, let's say, for
instance, you have your heart broken

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.521
by a particularly handsome
breed of dog.

01:10:18.556 --> 01:10:21.902
Well, then, you should expect
to have the exact same heartbreak

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:25.305
when you are stupid enough to fall
for the same breed of handsome dog.

01:10:25.329 --> 01:10:28.397
I mean, definition of insanity,
am I right? So right...

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.201
Ms. Simmons?
Councilman Snyder.

01:10:33.304 --> 01:10:36.238
I was just working on a...
a speech to a jury.

01:10:36.274 --> 01:10:38.541
Helps to practice
in front of an audience.

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:44.057
How can I help you?

01:10:44.081 --> 01:10:45.147
Well, as you may be aware,

01:10:45.183 --> 01:10:47.227
we're in the middle
of making a decision right now

01:10:47.251 --> 01:10:50.453
on whether or not to approve a plan
to develop the Pittman property.

01:10:50.488 --> 01:10:52.266
The paper said that had been decided.

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:56.425
No, no, we're close, but we're still in the
information gathering part of the equation.

01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:59.762
You should know that the board was
very impressed with the way you...

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:01.730
Now, how did Carter put it?

01:11:01.766 --> 01:11:04.233
Took us to the woodshed
over the bike lane lawsuit.

01:11:04.268 --> 01:11:08.048
Now, I understand you may have an
opinion or two about the Pittman matter?

01:11:08.072 --> 01:11:09.605
You bet I do.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.106
Good.
We're meeting later tonight.

01:11:11.142 --> 01:11:12.453
I'd really love
to hear your thoughts.

01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:13.576
Tonight?

01:11:13.611 --> 01:11:14.955
Yeah, I'm sorry
about the late notice.

01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:17.024
We only just had your name
presented to us.

01:11:17.048 --> 01:11:20.883
- Presented? By whom?
- Keith Amos.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:23.820
Hi.

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:26.255
Hi.

01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:29.198
Meg, come on in, I have that
paperwork for you to sign.

01:11:43.975 --> 01:11:45.074
He's not here.

01:11:46.911 --> 01:11:48.043
Where is he?

01:11:48.079 --> 01:11:50.157
Since he quit the firm,
it's really none of my business.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:53.649
- Keith quit?
- He didn't tell you?

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:54.950
No.

01:11:54.986 --> 01:11:56.897
We haven't spoken
in the last couple days.

01:11:56.921 --> 01:11:58.587
That makes two of us.

01:11:59.957 --> 01:12:02.424
Look, I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do here.

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:03.470
Well, you'd better be prepared

01:12:03.494 --> 01:12:07.263
to give your perspective on the
Pittman project, because I am.

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:21.577
Come on, Keith,
pick up, pick up, pick up...

01:12:21.612 --> 01:12:24.179
<i>Hey, this is Keith, leave a message.
And I'll get back to you soon...</i>

01:12:26.851 --> 01:12:27.816
Hi, Bill.

01:12:27.852 --> 01:12:32.466
Hey. Listen, Margie is back in Town,
and she wanted to pick up Gidget.

01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:35.591
<i>Do you think you could
bring her by tonight?</i>

01:12:39.163 --> 01:12:43.699
<i>And I'd also like to thank
the council for this opportunity.</i>

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.707
Sorry I'm late.

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:54.777
It took a lot longer to get all
these people together than I thought.

01:12:54.812 --> 01:12:56.679
What kind of stunt is this?

01:12:56.714 --> 01:13:00.182
It's not a stunt. It's just citizens
being concerned about their community.

01:13:00.217 --> 01:13:01.116
Keith, what's going on?

01:13:01.152 --> 01:13:02.362
We're going to present
our case to the board.

01:13:02.386 --> 01:13:03.386
No, no, no, no.

01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:05.098
I just found out about this,
I am not prepared.

01:13:05.122 --> 01:13:06.833
This is an anxiety dream
come to life...

01:13:06.857 --> 01:13:08.757
You are prepared, Kristie.

01:13:08.793 --> 01:13:12.127
Trust me, and just
let it be what it'll be.

01:13:18.703 --> 01:13:21.003
Ladies and gentlemen
of the board, thank you

01:13:21.038 --> 01:13:23.050
for giving us this opportunity
on such short notice

01:13:23.074 --> 01:13:24.084
to present our case

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:26.909
against the development
of the Pittman property.

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:29.712
Well, you certainly
have us intrigued, Mr. Amos.

01:13:29.747 --> 01:13:31.647
However, it is Valentine's day,

01:13:31.682 --> 01:13:33.716
and some of us do have
places to be.

01:13:33.751 --> 01:13:35.762
I understand,
councilman Snyder,

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:40.356
and you will be out of here and off
with Mrs. Snyder in under 10 minutes.

01:13:40.391 --> 01:13:42.891
Now, as your former Town attorney,
it was my job to present you

01:13:42.927 --> 01:13:45.494
with the various hurdles
you'd have to overcome

01:13:45.529 --> 01:13:48.364
in order
to fast-track authorization.

01:13:48.399 --> 01:13:51.233
Environmental impact studies,

01:13:51.268 --> 01:13:54.503
separate zoning variances for
water, sewage, and electricity.

01:13:54.538 --> 01:13:57.413
Fire, police, and emergency
medical impact studies,

01:13:57.441 --> 01:14:00.442
which would take
around five to seven years,

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:05.748
not counting community resistance,
and various... lawsuits,

01:14:05.783 --> 01:14:10.786
all of which would cost this Town
more than the projected revenue

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:12.788
from the development itself.

01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:15.068
Here's copies for everyone.

01:14:15.092 --> 01:14:16.937
Now, all of this, it's just data.

01:14:16.961 --> 01:14:19.628
What really matters here
are the people,

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:24.099
and how this proposed development
would impact them, and for that,

01:14:24.135 --> 01:14:27.069
I give you miss Kristie Simmons.

01:14:35.479 --> 01:14:38.547
Just speak from your heart,
tell them how you feel.

01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:41.750
You got this.

01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.990
Hello.

01:14:48.492 --> 01:14:49.758
Keith...

01:14:49.794 --> 01:14:54.063
Mr. Amos... Mentioned all of the
operational and logistical reasons

01:14:54.098 --> 01:14:55.731
to oppose this development,

01:14:55.766 --> 01:14:59.068
but I think that can be said
about most every development.

01:15:00.271 --> 01:15:03.005
Why this Beach
is so important to save

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.808
is what I would like to speak to.

01:15:11.315 --> 01:15:13.015
My mom once said

01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:17.686
the unofficial motto for this Town
should be "there's more to life",

01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:20.289
because that's what this
community brings to each of us,

01:15:20.324 --> 01:15:22.558
the perspective
on what's really important.

01:15:22.593 --> 01:15:26.161
And that Beach is the heart of
this community, it's in our name.

01:15:26.197 --> 01:15:29.431
Mrs. Pittman kept the land like it is
because she loved this Town,

01:15:29.467 --> 01:15:33.635
but nobody expected a nature
preserve to develop from the Beach,

01:15:33.671 --> 01:15:36.004
and yet, somehow,
that's what happened,

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.619
and now,
the beauty of that preserve

01:15:39.643 --> 01:15:43.645
is what draws people to this place,
and what keeps them here.

01:15:43.681 --> 01:15:45.948
And if we lose that...

01:15:45.983 --> 01:15:47.716
For what, condos?

01:15:49.053 --> 01:15:53.655
...we lose the very heart
of who we are as a community,

01:15:53.691 --> 01:15:57.126
and I believe
we're better than that.

01:15:58.329 --> 01:16:00.129
I hope you do, too.

01:16:00.164 --> 01:16:02.164
Thank you.

01:16:09.573 --> 01:16:11.907
I move to accept
Mr. Amos' recommendations

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:17.045
and to table all discussions on
the proposal for the time being.

01:16:17.081 --> 01:16:19.515
All those in favor?

01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:23.018
Motion carried.

01:16:31.195 --> 01:16:33.529
I am so proud of you, honey!

01:17:08.599 --> 01:17:11.133
Gidget!

01:17:28.354 --> 01:17:30.642
It's okay, girl. It's okay.

01:17:34.559 --> 01:17:36.392
Where's Margie?

01:17:36.427 --> 01:17:40.462
She had to go home,
but I can take Gidget to her.

01:17:40.498 --> 01:17:42.364
She passes on her thanks.

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:48.571
Here's the deal, Bill.
I can't say goodbye to Gidget.

01:17:48.606 --> 01:17:51.206
She's mine,
and I'm sure Margie

01:17:51.242 --> 01:17:55.644
is an amazing, generous
foster mom, but like I said...

01:17:57.682 --> 01:17:58.814
Gidget's mine.

01:17:58.849 --> 01:18:02.318
I already told Margie
that you'd be a failed foster.

01:18:02.353 --> 01:18:04.164
Or in your case,
a failed foster foster.

01:18:04.188 --> 01:18:06.255
- You did?
- I did.

01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:08.368
Look, we may not have been
a great couple, Kris,

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:12.628
but we were always good friends,
and good friends notice these things.

01:18:14.131 --> 01:18:16.532
Gidget's been yours
since the first paw-shake.

01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:19.302
- You're a pretty good guy, Bill Nolan.
- I am, right?

01:18:24.542 --> 01:18:26.320
And in case
you were curious,

01:18:26.344 --> 01:18:28.777
Delia is at my mom's cafe
right now

01:18:28.813 --> 01:18:30.679
for the Valentine's celebration.

01:18:30.715 --> 01:18:34.350
I don't know if maybe...
You wanted to stop by.

01:18:36.554 --> 01:18:40.322
Good friends
notice these things.

01:18:41.292 --> 01:18:43.991
Well, I might
have to make an appearance.

01:18:44.496 --> 01:18:46.696
- See you there?
- Yeah.

01:18:46.731 --> 01:18:48.764
I just have to check
on one thing.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.999
Sounds good.

01:19:01.646 --> 01:19:03.179
What now?

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.901
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:24.936 --> 01:19:26.180
You look...

01:19:28.173 --> 01:19:30.506
Did you help
with all the decorations?

01:19:30.542 --> 01:19:32.875
Yeah, it's...

01:19:32.911 --> 01:19:36.546
- Kind of my thing.
- It's a good thing.

01:19:38.082 --> 01:19:41.551
You know, the Goodman Club has a...

01:19:41.586 --> 01:19:43.152
A...

01:19:43.188 --> 01:19:45.535
- Valentine's day dance?
- Yes.

01:19:46.624 --> 01:19:47.902
Would you maybe...

01:19:47.926 --> 01:19:50.320
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:19:53.364 --> 01:19:55.097
Shall we?

01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:01.430
I'll get...
We shall. Okay.

01:20:13.985 --> 01:20:16.752
I just don't believe Keith would
leave without saying goodbye.

01:20:16.788 --> 01:20:19.555
Keith hasn't left.

01:20:19.591 --> 01:20:22.024
But there's a "for lease"
sign at his house.

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.471
Yeah, that's because we got
him a more long-term rental.

01:20:24.495 --> 01:20:26.629
He was even thinking
about buying.

01:20:26.664 --> 01:20:28.876
Well, then where is he?

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:31.078
Excuse me, hi. Is there
a Kristie Simmons here?

01:20:31.102 --> 01:20:34.270
Yeah, that's me.
Thanks.

01:20:37.242 --> 01:20:39.642
"Simon is waiting
for his Valentine".

01:20:39.677 --> 01:20:41.911
Waiting where?

01:20:53.324 --> 01:20:54.724
Come on, Gidget.

01:20:56.527 --> 01:20:58.894
Okay...

01:21:00.398 --> 01:21:04.300
Let's go find them.
Let's go find them...

01:21:04.335 --> 01:21:05.768
Come on!

01:21:13.678 --> 01:21:15.444
Okay, go get.

01:21:40.505 --> 01:21:44.574
Sorry I ran off after the decision,
but I had a lot of work to do.

01:21:46.611 --> 01:21:47.810
You certainly did.

01:21:47.846 --> 01:21:50.166
Yeah, I had to make
our first date memorable.

01:21:51.049 --> 01:21:54.017
Mission accomplished.

01:21:54.052 --> 01:21:56.986
I don't know
how you top this.

01:21:57.022 --> 01:22:00.356
Well, I've got plenty of time
to think of something

01:22:00.392 --> 01:22:01.758
now that I'm unemployed.

01:22:01.793 --> 01:22:03.326
No, not so fast, Counselor.

01:22:03.361 --> 01:22:04.927
There's a rumor going around

01:22:04.963 --> 01:22:07.997
that the Town board wants
to put in more parking meters.

01:22:08.033 --> 01:22:09.365
Heathens.

01:22:10.468 --> 01:22:13.736
And if they do, I'm going
to need reinforcements.

01:22:13.772 --> 01:22:17.106
For that, and any other schemes
that come their way.

01:22:18.643 --> 01:22:21.077
Counselor, did you just
offer me a job?

01:22:21.112 --> 01:22:23.913
No, Counselor,
I can't afford that,

01:22:23.948 --> 01:22:25.782
but maybe...

01:22:25.817 --> 01:22:28.918
- A partnership?
- Are the benefits good?

01:22:30.422 --> 01:22:34.157
Well, great views
away from the grindstone,

01:22:34.192 --> 01:22:37.860
lots of play dates for the pups,

01:22:37.896 --> 01:22:42.298
and a considerable amount of...

01:22:43.305 --> 01:22:49.440
