WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:05.221
What exactly
do we know about this guy?

00:05.455 --> 00:08.236
That he has a vintage jukebox
and wants to sell it to me.

00:08.324 --> 00:09.666
Well, that's just
what he said online.

00:09.753 --> 00:12.669
What if we drove all the way
to Reno and it's a total scam?

00:13.447 --> 00:15.619
What exactly
would the scam be?

00:16.033 --> 00:18.382
To get a couple to drive
three hours for no reason?

00:18.470 --> 00:20.751
"Ha, ha, I've stolen
your time."

00:21.587 --> 00:22.773
You are so innocent.

00:22.861 --> 00:24.845
It's like I'm in a relationship
with a baby.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.181
We get there,
they bring out the jukebox,

00:27.283 --> 00:28.447
you give them a bag of money,

00:28.535 --> 00:29.862
they say,
"We'll box it up for you,"

00:29.949 --> 00:31.864
they load it in the van,
we get home,

00:31.952 --> 00:33.780
the box is full of bricks
and sand.

00:34.073 --> 00:35.553
Who would do that?

00:35.736 --> 00:37.408
It... Oh, no.Yeah.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.462
I did it with stereo speakers.

00:39.550 --> 00:41.234
Sold the same pair 78 times.

00:41.322 --> 00:43.650
And where are they now?
In our living room.

00:43.817 --> 00:46.423
You scare me. I'm marrying
someone who scares me.

00:46.511 --> 00:49.165
Every couple needs
at least one scary person.

00:49.392 --> 00:51.275
The neighborhood Mormons
are afraid to knock on our door.

00:51.362 --> 00:52.712
You're welcome.

00:53.947 --> 00:55.862
Speaking of
getting married...

00:56.356 --> 00:57.792
I wasn't.

00:57.978 --> 00:59.831
Well, I am.

00:59.919 --> 01:01.935
I don't think you're allowed to
bring something up and then say,

01:02.023 --> 01:04.179
"Hey, speaking of that thing
I just brought up."

01:04.516 --> 01:06.189
Okay, how about this?

01:06.805 --> 01:08.106
Entirely new subject:

01:08.194 --> 01:10.126
I've been wondering
when we might get married.

01:10.241 --> 01:12.068
Well, why are you
wondering that? What's wrong?

01:12.155 --> 01:14.202
N-Nothing's wrong.
We postponed the wedding

01:14.290 --> 01:16.737
because the bar was struggling,
but now I can afford a jukebox.

01:16.824 --> 01:17.999
And... Or bricks and sand.

01:18.098 --> 01:20.056
My point is...

01:21.040 --> 01:23.209
no reason not
to set a date.

01:23.783 --> 01:26.103
Unless you have a reason.

01:26.992 --> 01:29.619
Wow. Are you accusing me
of not wanting to get married?

01:29.707 --> 01:31.501
Well, I wasn't,
but I'm starting to worry.

01:31.589 --> 01:34.533
Stop worrying. I will absolutely
marry you at some point.

01:34.736 --> 01:36.283
See, "at some point"

01:36.371 --> 01:38.211
sounds like that you
don't want to get married.

01:38.358 --> 01:40.315
So you are accusing me
of not wanting to get married.

01:40.403 --> 01:42.048
Well, you don't seem
very excited about it.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.165
Oh, you want excited?

01:43.253 --> 01:45.344
O-Oh! Let's get married!

01:45.535 --> 01:46.806
Is that better?

01:46.941 --> 01:50.244
I mean, a little bit.
It didn't feel totally real.

01:50.540 --> 01:53.282
For crying out loud, I'd marry
you any time, any place.

01:53.369 --> 01:54.697
If we weren't busy
getting scammed

01:54.785 --> 01:56.790
buying a vintage jukebox,
I'd marry you today.

01:56.895 --> 01:58.636
- You're so full of it.
- I am not.

01:58.683 --> 02:00.902
Well, we keep passing all
these quickie wedding chapels.

02:01.029 --> 02:02.712
How about I just pull
over at the next one?

02:02.800 --> 02:04.876
Great. That...
Right up here. Pull in.

02:04.964 --> 02:07.369
- I'm putting on the blinker.
- Blink away.

02:07.767 --> 02:08.789
Oh, perfect.

02:08.877 --> 02:10.532
I've always wanted to get
married next to an Arby's.

02:10.620 --> 02:12.462
See, there it is...
That-that's the flimsy excuse

02:12.549 --> 02:14.004
you're gonna use to
try to get out of it.

02:14.091 --> 02:15.667
I'm not getting
out of anything, Bozo.

02:15.755 --> 02:17.831
Okay, big talker,
are we doing this?

02:18.003 --> 02:19.838
Screw it, let's get married!

02:40.097 --> 02:41.266
Hey, how's it going, Tam?

02:41.354 --> 02:42.970
Not good.

02:43.776 --> 02:46.243
I woke up in a pleasant mood,
but then I walk into the kitchen

02:46.331 --> 02:48.321
and there's one of
Marjorie's little notes.

02:48.409 --> 02:50.830
"Don't forget to put the
milk away. X-O, Marjorie."

02:50.918 --> 02:52.791
She doesn't mean the X,
she doesn't mean the O.

02:52.879 --> 02:54.405
And who else is the
note gonna be from?

02:54.493 --> 02:56.080
The cats can't write.

02:56.245 --> 02:57.979
And they would never
want the milk put away.

02:58.067 --> 03:00.995
I mean, if you have a problem
with me, just talk to me.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.518
Don't write me a note.
I'm not scary, am I?

03:03.610 --> 03:05.167
No, ma'am.

03:05.842 --> 03:07.651
Oh, look.
There's the birthday girl.

03:07.739 --> 03:09.174
Got to go give her a hug
'cause it's her birthday.

03:09.262 --> 03:11.167
Happy sober birthday!

03:11.299 --> 03:12.996
Aw, thanks.

03:13.302 --> 03:16.354
Six whole years of me waking up
where I thought I would.

03:16.528 --> 03:19.292
I remember your first meeting
like it was yesterday.

03:19.380 --> 03:20.892
- You walked in...
- Please don't tell the

03:20.979 --> 03:22.503
"vomit in my purse" story.

03:22.591 --> 03:25.034
It's a tradition.
People love it.

03:25.192 --> 03:27.620
Always makes me
feel better about myself.

03:27.825 --> 03:29.807
Ooh, save it for the party.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.463
So you're gonna take
a cake today, right?

03:32.639 --> 03:33.954
No, I'm gonna wait.

03:34.042 --> 03:35.604
My mom's in Reno with Adam.

03:35.692 --> 03:37.612
Feels too important
to do it without her.

03:37.700 --> 03:40.753
Well, that's progress.
You used to only want your mom here

03:40.841 --> 03:42.930
so you could angrily
share at her.

03:43.247 --> 03:46.628
The trick was to always share
after her so she couldn't rebut.

03:47.208 --> 03:50.401
She'd try to bribe me with
Tic Tacs not to call on you.

03:50.987 --> 03:53.151
I did it once for orange.

03:54.576 --> 03:57.237
How's it going, Tammy? Not good.
Marjorie...

03:57.325 --> 03:58.631
Did you wake up today?

03:58.736 --> 04:00.142
Yeah, but...
are you sober?

04:00.230 --> 04:01.437
- Yeah, but...
- Do you have a bed,

04:01.525 --> 04:02.918
a job and friends?

04:03.006 --> 04:05.835
Yeah.
Then the answer is "amazing."

04:06.243 --> 04:08.729
I guess it is. I'm amazing.

04:08.878 --> 04:11.272
See, now why isn't
that on a Post-it?

04:14.049 --> 04:15.887
Hey, Nora.

04:16.135 --> 04:17.322
This is for you.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.260
Why are you giving me a card
on your birthday?

04:19.346 --> 04:21.253
'Cause I just want you to know
that I couldn't have made it

04:21.341 --> 04:23.862
through the last year
without you as my sponsor,

04:23.950 --> 04:26.448
and my sobriety is better
because you're a part of it.

04:27.076 --> 04:28.987
And now you know
what my card says.

04:29.229 --> 04:31.468
Well, congratulations.

04:31.556 --> 04:33.596
And now you know
what mycard says.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.074
You know, we could
just keep these

04:35.161 --> 04:36.963
and give them to
each other next year.

04:38.767 --> 04:40.073
What?

04:40.378 --> 04:41.987
Come sit with me for a minute.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.178
No. No, no, no.

04:44.265 --> 04:45.353
I am not sitting down.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.840
Sitting down means bad news.

04:46.928 --> 04:48.127
Well, you can stand
if you want to,

04:48.215 --> 04:49.784
I'm still moving to Minneapolis.

04:50.271 --> 04:52.831
What? You're not serious.

04:52.969 --> 04:55.417
I got an amazing opportunity.

04:55.548 --> 04:57.883
I'm going to be the new
Channel 5 meteorologist

04:57.971 --> 04:59.721
for the Land of 10,000 Lakes

04:59.809 --> 05:01.724
and a teeny, tiny
part of Canada.

05:01.906 --> 05:03.971
You can't go there,
I'm here.

05:04.059 --> 05:06.354
I'm sorry I'm telling you this
on your birthday,

05:06.442 --> 05:08.135
but they need me right now.

05:08.245 --> 05:09.924
It's better pay,
a bigger market,

05:10.012 --> 05:12.612
and the-the weather
is insane there.

05:12.745 --> 05:15.354
They have eight different kinds
of precipitation.

05:15.729 --> 05:17.559
Eight.

05:19.838 --> 05:21.588
But what am I gonna
do without you?

05:22.940 --> 05:24.463
Your sobriety

05:24.715 --> 05:26.940
does not depend on one person.

05:27.206 --> 05:28.667
You're gonna be fine.

05:30.484 --> 05:33.596
You're gonna be better
than fine. Give me a hug.

05:33.753 --> 05:35.229
You don't do hugs.

05:35.359 --> 05:36.885
I'm making an exception.

05:39.181 --> 05:40.846
Come on.

05:43.597 --> 05:45.860
This makes it so much worse.

05:48.246 --> 05:51.383
Bonnie, do you promise
to love, honor and cherish Adam

05:51.471 --> 05:52.824
for as long
as you both shall live?

05:52.911 --> 05:54.276
Yeah, whatever.

05:54.401 --> 05:56.357
And do you, Adam,
promise to love,

05:56.445 --> 05:58.987
- honor and cherish Bonnie...
- Yep. We done?

05:59.102 --> 06:01.387
Um, you haven't
exchanged rings.

06:01.475 --> 06:02.885
What else?

06:03.159 --> 06:05.141
Just the kiss.

06:06.661 --> 06:09.221
Aw. That, right there...
That's why we do this.

06:10.351 --> 06:11.682
I'm having trouble

06:11.770 --> 06:13.690
- getting you both in. Could you ju...
- Take it!

06:15.753 --> 06:17.143
Told you I'd marry you.

06:17.231 --> 06:19.753
Yep, you really showed me.

06:22.917 --> 06:25.745
I was so excited when I got
the call, within two hours,

06:25.833 --> 06:28.159
I had quit my job and
packed up half the house.

06:28.247 --> 06:30.294
Then Ralph comes home and
he's like, "What's going on?"

06:30.381 --> 06:33.948
I realized I had told the kids,
and had not told the husband.

06:34.915 --> 06:37.515
Luckily, he's an "up and coming"
mystery novelist,

06:37.603 --> 06:39.815
so he pretty much
has to do whatever I say.

06:40.119 --> 06:43.213
♪ Happy birthday to me ♪

06:43.691 --> 06:46.768
♪ Everyone, feel sorry for me ♪

06:47.090 --> 06:50.909
♪ Everybody leaves me,
everybody leaves me ♪

06:51.174 --> 06:54.659
♪ Everybody leaves Christy. ♪

06:55.938 --> 06:58.706
Finally, I just said,
"Ralph, all you do all day

06:58.829 --> 07:01.909
is write at Starbucks, and they
got those in Minneapolis, too."

07:02.094 --> 07:03.167
Anyway,

07:03.255 --> 07:05.779
I'm gonna miss
each and every one of you.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.151
But one of
you more than others.

07:07.239 --> 07:09.023
- That's all I got.
- Thank you.

07:09.111 --> 07:10.776
Come on!

07:13.018 --> 07:15.307
Let's hear it for Nora.

07:21.302 --> 07:23.674
How are you enjoying
the reception?

07:25.231 --> 07:27.378
This is exactly
how I pictured it.

07:30.003 --> 07:33.510
You know, it's possible
I was just hungry earlier.

07:33.633 --> 07:36.213
So we got married
'cause you were hangry?

07:36.301 --> 07:39.521
Oh. There were five
turning points in my life

07:39.628 --> 07:41.784
where a sandwich
would've changed everything.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.272
But then
I wouldn't have Christy.

07:43.667 --> 07:46.221
- At least I'm in good company.
- Mm.

07:48.414 --> 07:49.768
Oh, my God.

07:49.892 --> 07:51.963
Ah! I'm married.

07:52.453 --> 07:53.760
You're married.

07:54.060 --> 07:56.635
Everyone in this car is married.

07:57.033 --> 07:59.514
This day really took a
turn...

08:00.292 --> 08:01.831
...but I'm happy.

08:02.158 --> 08:03.721
I'm happy, too.

08:04.048 --> 08:06.485
Look at us,
being happily married.

08:07.010 --> 08:09.284
Dude, we are crushing this.

08:09.541 --> 08:12.932
We could run a marriage seminar.
Ooh, like a weekend retreat.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.440
Those are big moneymakers.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.026
Charge couples 400 bucks
to get in,

08:16.114 --> 08:17.433
and then they have
to buy my book.

08:17.520 --> 08:18.652
You haven't written a book.

08:18.815 --> 08:20.121
Well, how hard could it be?

08:20.209 --> 08:21.799
Just knock out a sassy forward

08:21.887 --> 08:24.151
and then steal from a bunch
of church pamphlets.

08:25.690 --> 08:28.034
My wife is so scary.

08:28.649 --> 08:30.870
All I heard is "my wife."

08:33.460 --> 08:36.164
I mean, I'm glad it's
your sober birthday and all,

08:36.253 --> 08:38.503
but why couldn't we go to
the bistro where the food's hot

08:38.591 --> 08:40.775
and it's not all lasagna?

08:41.186 --> 08:43.667
I told you I was
bringing my lasagna.

08:43.755 --> 08:45.838
I told you I was
bringing mylasagna.

08:46.208 --> 08:47.754
Seems like a thing
that could've been handled

08:47.841 --> 08:50.061
through a series
of Post-it notes.

08:51.115 --> 08:53.317
I only remind
people of things

08:53.405 --> 08:55.233
they need reminding of.

08:56.326 --> 08:58.373
Oh, I canceled
a massage for this.

08:58.461 --> 09:00.076
Christy, quick,
change the subject.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.255
I hate myself.

09:01.343 --> 09:02.849
Okay.

09:04.148 --> 09:06.365
Maybe Bjorn's still available.

09:06.679 --> 09:09.521
I just handled things
with Nora so badly.

09:09.644 --> 09:12.162
I can't believe that
after six years of sobriety,

09:12.250 --> 09:14.013
I can still
take someone's good news

09:14.101 --> 09:15.998
and only focus on
how it negatively affects me.

09:16.086 --> 09:17.841
The Germans call that
gluckschmerz.

09:17.929 --> 09:19.935
Bad feelings
over someone's good luck.

09:20.023 --> 09:22.366
It's the opposite
of schadenfreude.

09:23.383 --> 09:25.569
I guess you had a lot of time
to read in prison.

09:25.657 --> 09:28.491
No, my cellmate was German.
Hildé.

09:29.663 --> 09:32.421
Good communicator,
never left notes.

09:33.828 --> 09:36.770
I want to be happy for Nora,
but I'm so much better

09:36.858 --> 09:39.046
at feeling sad for myself.

09:39.421 --> 09:42.419
I get it. Worst part
about being in beauty pageants

09:42.507 --> 09:44.490
was when someone else won,
and I had to stand there smiling

09:44.577 --> 09:45.594
and clapping
like I was happy for them,

09:45.681 --> 09:47.225
but the whole time,
I'm thinking,

09:47.313 --> 09:50.077
"Well, what the hell did I sleep
with that judge for?"

09:51.538 --> 09:54.263
Christy, it's okay to be upset,

09:54.351 --> 09:56.677
just don't rain on
someone else's parade.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.871
You've got to act
better than you feel.

09:58.996 --> 10:02.371
Like I did when Marjorie
betrayed me with her lasagna.

10:02.544 --> 10:04.666
Yeah, no matter how much
you're dying inside,

10:04.754 --> 10:07.514
you got to flash that
big old Vaseline smile.

10:07.601 --> 10:08.699
Vaseline?

10:08.787 --> 10:11.379
Yeah. You put it on your teeth
so your lips don't stick.

10:11.590 --> 10:13.676
And hemorrhoid cream
tightens up your eyes.

10:13.777 --> 10:15.566
Once, when I was drunk,
I switched them.

10:15.653 --> 10:18.379
My face was shiny
and my lips were tiny.

10:19.918 --> 10:20.919
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:21.006 --> 10:22.051
Hey...

10:22.138 --> 10:23.035
Sorry we're late.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.972
Yeah, we stopped
and got married!

10:26.137 --> 10:27.181
What?

10:27.269 --> 10:29.660
Yeah, we did it in Reno
in a quickie chapel.

10:29.751 --> 10:31.308
Oh... But wait...

10:31.449 --> 10:33.583
What about the wedding
you guys were planning

10:33.671 --> 10:35.215
that we've been
talking about forever?

10:35.303 --> 10:36.870
- Eh, skipping it.
- I love my wife.

10:36.958 --> 10:38.829
- I love my husband.
- Mm...

10:40.343 --> 10:41.606
Chris, you got a little

10:41.694 --> 10:43.452
gluckschmerz
on your face.

10:52.217 --> 10:54.255
I forgot what these look like
when they're not covered

10:54.342 --> 10:55.576
in Post-it Notes.

10:55.700 --> 10:59.256
"Don't forget to rinse me.
Being dirty makes me sad."

10:59.747 --> 11:01.888
Why don't we get 'em an
Insta-Pot and be done with it?

11:01.976 --> 11:04.859
Too nice. People who didn't
invite us to their wedding.

11:04.947 --> 11:06.849
Don't deserve tender,
fall-off-the-bone meat

11:06.937 --> 11:08.634
in less than an hour.

11:09.045 --> 11:11.367
Yeah, I bought an outfit for
this wedding a long time ago,

11:11.422 --> 11:12.663
and now I'm never gonna
get to wear it.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.622
Nobody else I know
is ever getting married.

11:17.257 --> 11:19.045
I see you there.

11:20.793 --> 11:24.513
There goes my chance to
shove cake in Adam's face.

11:25.068 --> 11:26.077
That's the bride.

11:26.164 --> 11:27.912
I know who's who!

11:29.472 --> 11:32.732
She told me I was gonna be
the one to give her away.

11:32.901 --> 11:36.284
Do you know how long I have been
waiting to give her away?

11:38.197 --> 11:39.372
That's it.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.614
I'm gonna get her these thingies

11:41.701 --> 11:43.073
you put on snack bags.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.753
They're called "chip clips."

11:45.374 --> 11:46.855
I'm not showing off,
it's just...

11:46.998 --> 11:48.839
you need them
when you live alone.

11:49.054 --> 11:51.099
I thought this was supposed
to be a group gift.

11:51.217 --> 11:52.503
It is.

11:52.910 --> 11:54.869
You each owe me 75 cents.

11:54.957 --> 11:56.828
Oh, come on, ladies,
we're not gonna

11:56.916 --> 11:59.120
punish Bonnie
with her wedding gift.

11:59.331 --> 12:01.355
Even though we should,
because they literally

12:01.443 --> 12:03.214
wouldn't be together
if it weren't for me.

12:03.302 --> 12:04.567
Ooh, everybody grab your phones.

12:04.654 --> 12:06.269
It's a rare sighting
of Mad Marge.

12:06.357 --> 12:08.573
How many times did
I talk her off the ledge

12:08.661 --> 12:10.901
when she was ready to
blow everything up with Adam?

12:11.079 --> 12:13.385
I deserve to be
a bridesmaid.

12:13.612 --> 12:16.011
At the very least,
recite a poem.

12:16.190 --> 12:18.192
What happened to
"act better than you feel"?

12:18.280 --> 12:20.511
Trust me, I am.

12:20.985 --> 12:23.042
Well, now that we're getting
things off our chest,

12:23.130 --> 12:25.495
where the hell are the
free samples around here?

12:25.583 --> 12:27.073
I smell apple cider.

12:27.161 --> 12:28.917
Where is it?!

12:29.805 --> 12:33.730
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

12:33.874 --> 12:37.138
♪ Keep coming back ♪

12:46.901 --> 12:48.420
Christy. Alcoholic.

12:48.507 --> 12:49.949
- Hi, Christy. - Hi, Christy.
- Hi, Christy. - Hi, Christy.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.854
I want to thank the women
who gave me my cake.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.431
If it wasn't for
your love and support,

12:55.519 --> 12:57.095
I wouldn't be standing here.

12:57.212 --> 12:58.938
Or anywhere.

12:59.548 --> 13:02.260
And that goes double
for my mom, who...

13:05.811 --> 13:07.313
You know...

13:07.574 --> 13:11.012
I was gonna take this cake
the other night,

13:11.100 --> 13:14.539
but I didn't, 'cause
my mom wasn't here.

13:14.751 --> 13:16.485
I didn't want her to miss

13:16.573 --> 13:18.493
a big event in my life.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.546
Silly me...

13:22.759 --> 13:24.571
I thought it might
hurt her feelings

13:24.659 --> 13:27.360
to be left out of something
so important.

13:29.352 --> 13:32.046
That's why I waited
until she was here...

13:32.134 --> 13:33.110
So she could enjoy

13:33.198 --> 13:35.688
how friggin' far I've come.

13:35.876 --> 13:37.878
I've come really far.

13:38.082 --> 13:41.563
Got that, Mom?
Really far.

13:41.651 --> 13:44.024
And you already shared,
so suck it!

13:45.608 --> 13:48.654
Yep, that's how I'm ending it.

13:53.392 --> 13:54.727
Do you believe this?

13:54.815 --> 13:56.852
Wait'll you hear mine.

14:07.375 --> 14:09.665
Look, I am using and enjoying

14:09.753 --> 14:11.712
my chip clips.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.790
I know they were
a gift of spite,

14:17.878 --> 14:20.063
but I'm gonna
go ahead and say it:

14:20.151 --> 14:22.360
game changer.

14:25.113 --> 14:26.680
Listen...

14:26.947 --> 14:28.649
I need to say something.

14:30.250 --> 14:32.948
I am sorry for the way
I shared today.

14:33.668 --> 14:36.282
It was not very
"six years sober" of me.

14:36.370 --> 14:38.417
Well, there was some chatter
about it at the cookie table,

14:38.504 --> 14:39.983
mostly from me.

14:42.442 --> 14:44.749
The truth is...

14:45.266 --> 14:46.884
I'm just really hurt.

14:48.298 --> 14:51.083
We have been through such
horrible stuff together,

14:51.171 --> 14:54.263
and finally, something
wonderful happened

14:54.351 --> 14:56.645
and you didn't let me
be a part of it.

15:00.318 --> 15:03.320
This may... come as a surprise,

15:03.408 --> 15:06.087
given my delightful
narcissism...

15:07.511 --> 15:10.296
...but deep down,
I always assume that what I do

15:10.384 --> 15:11.994
doesn't matter to people.

15:12.082 --> 15:14.806
You know, it-it just
didn't occur to me

15:14.963 --> 15:16.703
that anyone would care.

15:17.641 --> 15:19.429
Well, that's stupid.

15:20.749 --> 15:22.447
I cared a lot.

15:22.761 --> 15:24.110
And it's not just me.

15:24.198 --> 15:25.890
Everybody's upset
they missed it.

15:25.978 --> 15:28.024
I heard Marjorie share,
I know.

15:29.483 --> 15:31.703
Strange as it may seem,

15:32.383 --> 15:33.914
people want to be
a part of your life

15:34.002 --> 15:35.743
because they love you.

15:37.485 --> 15:40.820
Honey, I am so sorry.

15:44.357 --> 15:48.289
If I ever get married again,
I promise you'll be there.

15:50.892 --> 15:52.617
- Mom? 
- Yeah?

15:54.102 --> 15:57.279
Can I please be the next one
to get married?

16:02.535 --> 16:04.058
Everyone's mad at me.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.367
I'll need more context.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.259
Turns out I'm beloved.

16:09.417 --> 16:11.687
There was, like, 
a Royal Wedding level of interest

16:11.775 --> 16:13.023
in seeing me get married.

16:13.111 --> 16:14.266
You mean seeing us 
get married.

16:14.353 --> 16:16.953
I don't remember anyone
mentioning you, but maybe.

16:17.804 --> 16:20.312
Our wedding was
a gigantic mistake.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.219
- Well, that didn't take long.
- No...

16:22.307 --> 16:24.851
I am serious.
You really screwed us this time.

16:24.939 --> 16:27.245
- Me?
- Yeah. Pressuring me to get married.

16:27.333 --> 16:28.509
And then tempting me
with Arby's.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.946
I mean, how could you forget
I have a daughter?

16:31.034 --> 16:32.731
You forget all the time.

16:33.471 --> 16:35.492
Well, she's devastated.

16:35.580 --> 16:36.703
And what about my friends?

16:36.791 --> 16:38.063
You certainly didn't think
about them.

16:38.150 --> 16:40.725
You robbed those people
of a moment of joy,

16:40.813 --> 16:43.312
and they have so little
to look forward to.

16:44.278 --> 16:46.057
So what do you want to do...
Have another wedding?

16:46.144 --> 16:48.497
- Oh, like you'd do that.
- Of course I'd do that. I'd marry you

16:48.584 --> 16:50.002
at the bar tomorrow
in front of everyone

16:50.089 --> 16:51.417
if it'd get you to shut up.

16:51.505 --> 16:53.716
Well, I'll never shut up.
See you at 2:00.

16:53.844 --> 16:56.501
Fine! And fix that crazy hair.

17:03.358 --> 17:05.704
Thank you for asking me
to officiate.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.173
Oh, let's face it...
we wouldn't still be together

17:08.261 --> 17:09.212
if it wasn't for you.

17:09.300 --> 17:13.042
Oh, that's a wild
exaggeration.

17:15.065 --> 17:16.532
Are you nervous?

17:16.646 --> 17:18.087
It's my second wedding
in three days.

17:18.175 --> 17:19.634
I'm getting the hang of it.

17:20.704 --> 17:23.814
Oh, you look beautiful.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.608
Are you ready?

17:25.790 --> 17:28.025
I can't believe I ever
did this without you.

17:28.273 --> 17:29.595
I'm so glad you're here.

17:29.866 --> 17:31.258
Me too.

17:35.207 --> 17:36.513
Wendy?

17:46.244 --> 17:48.111
Now I've got something old,
something new,

17:48.199 --> 17:50.811
something borrowed
and something weird.

17:54.450 --> 17:57.061
She's all yours.

17:57.687 --> 17:59.950
No give-backs.

18:00.710 --> 18:02.968
Oh, God, I forgot my tissue.

18:03.060 --> 18:05.453
No, Marjorie left me
a note to remember them.

18:05.803 --> 18:07.992
She's the best.

18:12.138 --> 18:14.552
Friends, we are here today

18:14.640 --> 18:16.991
to witness a miracle.

18:22.953 --> 18:24.912
Two lasagnas... seriously?

18:29.038 --> 18:31.171
It's my signature dish.

18:31.266 --> 18:32.975
It's mysignature dish.

18:34.269 --> 18:36.342
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:36.430 --> 18:37.910
may I present.

18:38.008 --> 18:40.426
Mr. and Mrs. Adam and Bonnie.

18:40.514 --> 18:42.850
Plunkett-Janikowski!

18:51.895 --> 18:54.202
Wendy, as beautiful as that is,

18:54.289 --> 18:55.594
we've already picked out a song.

18:55.819 --> 18:58.119
- Well, I'm here if you need me.
- Uh-huh.

18:58.206 --> 19:00.147
Christy, C-7.

19:03.097 --> 19:05.926
May I have this dance,
Mrs. Janikowski?

19:06.170 --> 19:07.621
You may.

19:07.854 --> 19:10.143
<i>♪ Fly me to the moon... ♪</i>

19:10.231 --> 19:12.712
But we're gonna have to
talk about that name.

19:14.172 --> 19:16.305
<i>♪ Among the stars...</i>

19:16.393 --> 19:19.314
Are you feeling good
or just acting like it?

19:19.861 --> 19:22.103
I am genuinely happy
for them.

19:22.310 --> 19:24.721
It's a very unfamiliar
feeling.

19:24.948 --> 19:26.646
Here's hoping you
get used to it.

19:26.734 --> 19:29.388
<i>♪ Hold my hand ♪</i>

19:29.802 --> 19:31.848
- Hey, I've been thinking.
- Mm?

19:32.119 --> 19:34.851
I owe so much
of my six years to you.

19:34.938 --> 19:36.548
I... I was wondering if there's

19:36.635 --> 19:39.160
- any chance...
- I would love to be your sponsor again.

19:39.247 --> 19:42.533
- Really?
- Of course.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.010
You've gotten a lot less
needy than you used to be.

19:46.254 --> 19:48.430
Oh, God,
I was hoping you'd notice.

19:48.517 --> 19:50.775
<i>♪ You are all I long for... ♪</i>

19:50.878 --> 19:53.596
Damn it! Got lasagna
on my outfit.

19:53.791 --> 19:56.533
- Whose lasagna?
- Whose lasagna?

19:58.962 --> 20:00.746
I'm enjoying this.

20:00.833 --> 20:01.971
Me too.

20:02.059 --> 20:04.496
Where do you want
our third wedding to be?

20:05.901 --> 20:07.207
Can a gal cut in?

20:07.395 --> 20:09.643
Oh, I'll check back.
I'm sorry.
