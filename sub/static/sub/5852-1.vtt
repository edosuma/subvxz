<i>My name is Xiong Dun.</i>

02:01.000 --> 02:01.880
<i>Xiong, like a bear.</i>

02:01.880 --> 02:02.840
<i>Dun, like Newton.</i>

02:03.160 --> 02:04.080
<i>Tomorrow,</i>

02:04.080 --> 02:05.400
<i>I'll be turning 29.</i>

02:06.080 --> 02:06.760
<i>Alexander Bell</i>

02:06.760 --> 02:08.240
<i>invented the telephone when he was 29.</i>

02:08.800 --> 02:09.759
<i>Murakami</i>

02:09.759 --> 02:11.520
<i>started writing novels when he was 29.</i>

02:12.880 --> 02:13.760
<i>Spielberg</i>

02:13.760 --> 02:15.520
<i>directed "Jaws" when he was 29.</i>

02:15.520 --> 02:18.400
<i>and at 29, Steve Jobs introduced the Macintosh.</i>

02:18.400 --> 02:19.600
<i>I believe,</i>

02:19.600 --> 02:22.200
<i>the next 29-year-old to influence the world,</i>

02:22.200 --> 02:23.880
<i>has to be me!</i>

02:57.480 --> 02:58.240
<i>If</i>

02:58.240 --> 03:00.280
<i>the butterfly effect does exist.</i>

03:00.280 --> 03:01.080
<i>Then I think,</i>

03:01.080 --> 03:02.400
<i>I must be the butterfly,</i>

03:02.400 --> 03:05.800
<i>that could flap its wings,
and change the world.</i>

03:29.400 --> 03:30.720
Hey you!

03:31.480 --> 03:32.480
Do you have a death wish?

03:32.480 --> 03:33.840
Hurry up!

03:38.360 --> 03:39.320
<i>Fine,</i>

03:39.320 --> 03:40.800
<i>you got me.</i>

03:41.200 --> 03:42.600
<i>In this city,</i>

03:42.600 --> 03:44.440
<i>I'm no butterfly.</i>

03:44.880 --> 03:47.760
<i>Maybe a moth at best.</i>

03:53.440 --> 03:54.280
<i>Perhaps,</i>

03:54.280 --> 03:55.600
<i>for most girls,</i>

03:55.600 --> 03:58.520
<i>success means having the perfect wedding.</i>

04:05.520 --> 04:06.680
<i>But,</i>

04:07.320 --> 04:08.400
<i>that's not me.</i>

04:08.400 --> 04:10.000
We gather here today,

04:10.360 --> 04:11.760
to join together this man

04:12.160 --> 04:14.400
and this woman, in holy matrimony.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.360
If anyone

04:16.680 --> 04:17.640
has any objections,

04:18.399 --> 04:21.120
please speak now, or forever hold your peace.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.200
Sorry.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.000
If no one objects,

04:46.560 --> 04:47.440
Okay.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.200
Excuse me. I had to work late last night.

04:49.200 --> 04:49.840
Mr. Jiang.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.880
I didn't miss anything,right?

04:50.880 --> 04:52.480
I already said you didn't have to come.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.880
This is way too important to miss.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.520
Through good times and bad,

04:59.520 --> 05:00.320
in sickness or health...

05:00.320 --> 05:01.720
<i>To be honest,</i>

05:01.720 --> 05:04.880
<i>if it wasn't for leaving a good impression
on the boyfriend's parents,</i>

05:04.880 --> 05:07.400
<i>I'd be home sleeping, right about now.</i>

05:11.720 --> 05:13.160
Look over here.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.640
Smile. OK.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.720
Cousin and cousin-in-law,

05:15.720 --> 05:16.760
I'm Xiong Dun.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.120
You are Chuan's girlfriend right?

05:19.120 --> 05:19.840
That's me!

05:19.840 --> 05:21.280
You are really pretty!

05:24.160 --> 05:25.600
You got a loose thread

05:28.560 --> 05:29.840
Sorry.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.320
I pulled too hard.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.840
It's a loose thread.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.240
It really is a loose thread.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.440
If you are tired,

05:42.440 --> 05:43.840
you can go home and sleep.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.440
No one would mind.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.560
No, I'm okay.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.040
Why would I be tired?

05:49.480 --> 05:50.880
I'm doing this for you.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.680
Right?

05:56.120 --> 05:57.680
That poop-haired lady,

05:57.680 --> 05:59.280
is that the groom's mom?

06:00.400 --> 06:01.640
That's my mom.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.440
I'm sorry.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.320
I should go say hello.

06:11.760 --> 06:12.720
That's okay.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.120
More eating.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.000
Less talking.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.040
Here, this is for you.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.040
It will guarantee

06:35.480 --> 06:36.920
a happy marriage in the near future.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.480
There are two types of bosses in the world,

06:40.480 --> 06:42.560
There are only two kinds of men in this world,

06:42.560 --> 06:44.280
dumb ones and dumber ones.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.720
cowards and cheaters.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.160
Which one would you choose?

06:47.680 --> 06:50.200
And a Virgo on top of all that,

06:50.200 --> 06:52.160
now that's one of a kind.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.280
That's what my boss is like.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.480
Right on her chin,

06:54.480 --> 06:56.160
there's a huge mole.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.320
She spends all day covering it up,
again and again, and again.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.560
The harder she tries, the more obvious it is.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.760
Stop trying to hide it.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.600
I mean what's the point?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.720
Where are my applause?

07:10.720 --> 07:13.400
I just love champagne.

07:14.120 --> 07:14.760
Damn it.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.240
She is so freaking heavy!

07:16.480 --> 07:17.160
<i>Lao Zheng</i>

07:18.600 --> 07:20.120
<i>She's a small business owner,</i>

07:20.120 --> 07:22.000
<i>and amateur boxing enthusiast.</i>

07:22.000 --> 07:23.800
<i>Her punches are
steady, accurate, and fierce.</i>

07:23.800 --> 07:25.720
<i>And as a person, not one bit less.</i>

07:34.880 --> 07:35.840
<i>Your typical Beijing chic.</i>

07:37.400 --> 07:38.440
<i>When she's around girls,</i>

07:38.440 --> 07:39.520
<i>she's manly.</i>

07:39.520 --> 07:40.680
<i>And when she's around guys...</i>

07:40.680 --> 07:41.880
<i>even manlier.</i>

07:42.360 --> 07:43.400
<i>She loves plaid shirts,</i>

07:43.400 --> 07:44.720
<i>dislikes pretty dresses.</i>

07:45.120 --> 07:46.520
<i>Wherever she goes,</i>

07:46.520 --> 07:48.400
<i>a trail of screams follow.</i>

07:50.000 --> 07:50.840
Let me go.

07:50.840 --> 07:52.320
I can walk by myself.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.360
Stop messing around.

07:54.680 --> 07:55.520
<i>Emmy.</i>

07:55.520 --> 07:57.560
<i>My BFF and roommate.</i>

08:05.120 --> 08:06.000
<i>Likes Koreans dramas...</i>

08:06.000 --> 08:07.200
<i>loves American shows!</i>

08:11.760 --> 08:12.920
<i>She loves selfies...</i>

08:14.480 --> 08:15.680
<i>but no peace signs, please.</i>

08:16.160 --> 08:17.360
<i>Loves working...</i>

08:17.360 --> 08:18.400
<i>hates overtime.</i>

08:19.040 --> 08:20.560
<i>Even though she always has to...</i>

08:22.320 --> 08:24.160
You got it now?

08:25.800 --> 08:26.920
<i>She is an actuary working for
a Japanese company,</i>

08:27.280 --> 08:29.600
<i>with an insanely unreasonable boss.</i>

08:29.600 --> 08:31.600
<i>That's why she's always exhausted.</i>

08:34.480 --> 08:35.760
Push! Just a little more! Push!

08:37.000 --> 08:37.880
<i>Well, okay.</i>

08:37.880 --> 08:39.600
<i>I made up that last part.</i>

08:39.600 --> 08:41.600
<i>But it really, really is that bad.</i>

08:43.280 --> 08:44.480
Holy crap!

08:44.480 --> 08:45.720
Damn that's exhausting.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.000
You always mess with me
at the most important parts.

08:50.640 --> 08:51.720
Play.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.240
That's my man!

09:00.240 --> 09:01.080
Move.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.160
I'm here to protect you.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.440
Step back.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.600
Me and my love are going zombie killing!

09:07.840 --> 09:08.600
Demons,

09:08.600 --> 09:09.480
back away!

09:12.320 --> 09:12.880
Emmy,

09:12.880 --> 09:14.040
I'm really sorry.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.160
Gotta go.

09:15.160 --> 09:15.760
Lao Zheng.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.120
There are people inside.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.480
Let's hide for a while.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.040
I would rather be killed.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.120
It's not safe outside.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.120
Oh my god.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.480
When did you come in?

09:53.080 --> 09:55.800
Xiao Xia asked you if
you remember what day today is?

09:57.320 --> 09:58.280
Deadline date!

09:59.000 --> 10:00.880
How many did I tell you to finish last time?

10:01.440 --> 10:02.880
Procrastination!

10:05.760 --> 10:07.480
There's something wrong with you right?

10:08.880 --> 10:09.840
Nothing's wrong with me.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.240
What's the matter with you?

10:15.160 --> 10:16.080
Nothing.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.320
What are you saying?

10:17.320 --> 10:19.000
Are you out of your mind?

10:19.240 --> 10:21.200
That wasn't a question.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.280
Last time you said to finish five,

10:26.520 --> 10:27.640
so I put in more hours and finished it.

10:27.640 --> 10:28.600
It's all done.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.040
More hours? Doing what, goofing around?

10:31.040 --> 10:32.560
Last time I said seven!

10:32.560 --> 10:33.800
You said five!

10:33.800 --> 10:34.600
I'm sure of it.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.320
If you'd said seven,

10:35.320 --> 10:36.560
there's no way I would finish that,

10:36.560 --> 10:37.920
so I wouldn't have agreed in the first place.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.600
Are you saying that it was my mistake?

10:39.600 --> 10:40.560
Are you?

10:40.560 --> 10:41.440
Sounds to me like you
don't want your job anymore,

10:41.440 --> 10:42.840
If that's the case, you can get out.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.280
There are a lot of people waiting for your spot.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.120
What, you think I wanna be...

10:47.120 --> 10:47.800
here

10:48.240 --> 10:49.000
right?

11:00.360 --> 11:01.120
Okay,

11:01.480 --> 11:02.440
let's continue.

11:03.040 --> 11:03.760
Xia,

11:04.480 --> 11:05.400
say something.

11:18.680 --> 11:19.640
Honey!

11:20.120 --> 11:21.680
Guess you're still in that meeting.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.640
Message me back when you're done okay?

11:25.000 --> 11:25.880
Miss you.

11:57.080 --> 11:57.880
This is good.

12:02.440 --> 12:03.760
Waitress. Clean it up.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.760
What are you doing?

12:20.120 --> 12:21.600
There are a lot of people here.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.880
You're so bad.

12:24.600 --> 12:25.600
Quiet for a second,

12:26.440 --> 12:27.640
she just called me.

12:27.640 --> 12:28.720
I didn't even answer.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.440
Let me call her back.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.720
What are you doing, sweetheart?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.240
Answer the phone.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.040
What are you doing, sweetheart?

12:40.760 --> 12:41.720
Xiong Dun!

12:44.640 --> 12:45.400

12:47.360 --> 12:48.160

14:31.680 --> 14:32.840
<i>Sorry I can't come.</i>

14:32.840 --> 14:33.800
<i>We'll celebrate another day.</i>

14:33.800 --> 14:34.600
<i>Xiong,</i>

14:34.600 --> 14:36.400
<i>Stupid manager is dragging
everyone to dinner,</i>

14:36.400 --> 14:37.480
<i>you're lucky you got away,</i>

14:37.480 --> 14:38.200
<i>Gotta go.</i>

14:38.200 --> 14:38.920
<i>We'll talk tomorrow</i>

14:39.400 --> 14:40.600
<i>Xiong, I've got a game tomorrow,</i>

14:40.600 --> 14:41.560
<i>you guys have fun.</i>

14:41.560 --> 14:42.760
<i>I'll head over after the match.</i>

14:52.080 --> 14:54.520
[Your mom]

14:57.840 --> 14:58.800
Mom.

14:58.800 --> 14:59.680
<i>Sweetheart,</i>

15:00.000 --> 15:02.040
Happy birthday!

Thanks mom.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.520
<i>You guys finished decorating?</i>

15:06.520 --> 15:07.480
Yes, just finished.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.840
We're letting it ventilate a little bit.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.560
<i>Next time you're back,
you could stay at our new house.</i>

15:11.560 --> 15:12.680
ls dad there?

15:12.680 --> 15:13.640
Yeah, he's here.

15:13.640 --> 15:14.720
<i>Papa Xiong,</i>

15:15.560 --> 15:16.800
<i>Come here. Our daughter is on the phone.</i>

15:26.160 --> 15:27.240

there are plenty of good jobs for you here.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.760
You should come back.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.920
It's better here.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.080
The air is fresh.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.640
It's her birthday today.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.000
Stop with your blabbering.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.760
<i>Your dad,</i>

15:36.760 --> 15:38.160

15:41.720 --> 15:42.640
I'll be with...

15:43.400 --> 15:44.480
Lao Zheng,

15:44.480 --> 15:45.640
<i>Xiao Xia,</i>

15:46.120 --> 15:47.680
<i>and Emmy.</i>

15:48.480 --> 15:50.240
They bought a huge cake for me.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.200
<i>Don't eat too much cake.</i>

15:52.200 --> 15:54.280
Sugar is not good for you.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.600
I know, I know.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.840
We're gonna go now.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.080
Talk soon.

15:59.080 --> 15:59.840
<i>Bye.</i>

16:00.280 --> 16:00.920
Okay, okay, okay.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.400
[See you there]

16:26.240 --> 16:28.480
Surprise!

16:30.000 --> 16:33.760
May your fortune rise as high as the sky!

16:33.760 --> 16:37.080
We wish you a happy birthday!

16:37.080 --> 16:38.640
Come on. Picture time!

16:40.040 --> 16:41.760
You guys suck.

16:42.480 --> 16:43.760
If you guys showed up a little later,

16:43.760 --> 16:45.440
I probably would've killed myself.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.560
It's just a job.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.080
Coward.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.880
I didn't see you stand up for me today.

16:52.840 --> 16:53.640
Well...

16:53.640 --> 16:54.600
Let this one go,

16:54.600 --> 16:57.080
He did a good job preparing your party.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.120
Very dependable.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.360
Here.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.120
Take these.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.000
How's this gift for you?

17:10.240 --> 17:12.000
How did you guys find out?

17:13.319 --> 17:15.880
The jerk was showing off on his profile.

17:15.880 --> 17:16.920
What?

17:16.920 --> 17:18.440
Said something like,
his dreams are finally coming true.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.520
What an ass.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.440
We never liked that jerk actually.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.319
Really don't know what you see in him.

17:23.319 --> 17:24.720
Now you tell me...

17:28.440 --> 17:29.360
Emmy,

17:29.360 --> 17:32.040
how about the jerk you're dating,
let's make him a target too.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.840
That's right, Emmy.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.280
How could I forget you?

17:35.280 --> 17:36.440
If we put all the boyfriends together
and had a competition,

17:36.440 --> 17:38.160
You'd win, for sure.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.600
Let me tell you,

17:39.600 --> 17:40.920
if it were up to me,

17:40.920 --> 17:41.800
I'd pretend to be single.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.480
When she found out about it,

17:43.480 --> 17:44.640
he'd say stuff like he's got marriage problems.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.400
I'd slap the crap out of him.

17:46.760 --> 17:47.480
Alright, okay,

17:47.480 --> 17:48.480
everybody,

17:48.480 --> 17:49.480
today is a day for celebration.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.520
We should talk about something more cheerful.

17:52.200 --> 17:52.880
Xiong,

17:53.160 --> 17:54.000
for you.

17:55.000 --> 17:55.800
Oh.

17:55.800 --> 17:56.840
Hey, listen,

17:56.840 --> 17:58.240
I wrote this song.

17:58.480 --> 17:59.360
Love it.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.360
You should quit your stupid job, like I did.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.640
Let's start fresh, together.

18:07.120 --> 18:07.920
Xiong,

18:07.920 --> 18:09.120
I don't think that was quitting.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.400
You were fired!

18:11.480 --> 18:13.000
- Say it again, I dare you!
-Stop, stop.

18:13.000 --> 18:13.800
Else,

18:13.800 --> 18:15.120
you can kiss your present goodbye.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.440
That's more like it.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.160
Why is it so light?

18:20.160 --> 18:21.360
Did you write me a check?

18:27.240 --> 18:28.120
Holy...

18:28.120 --> 18:29.000
Xiao Xia,

18:29.240 --> 18:30.600
thanks a lot.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.920
Man, you are generous.

18:31.920 --> 18:32.920
Let me tell you,

18:32.920 --> 18:35.000
I've been saving those numbers for a long time.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.200
You know how much the jackpot is now?

18:37.480 --> 18:39.280
Over 200 million!

18:39.280 --> 18:41.400
This would have worked usually,

18:41.400 --> 18:43.480
but today is the worst day of my life.

18:43.480 --> 18:44.320
Silly girl.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.520
All this means your luck's
about to turn around.

18:46.520 --> 18:47.480
I think so too.

18:47.480 --> 18:48.720
I really hope my bad luck ends right now.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.200
When life sucks,

18:51.200 --> 18:52.120
most of the time,

18:52.120 --> 18:53.120
you could only share

18:53.120 --> 18:54.560
so little.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.360
As for the rest,

18:57.520 --> 18:58.800
just tell them to go away.

18:58.800 --> 18:59.440
That's right!

18:59.440 --> 19:00.560
Let them all just go away!

19:00.560 --> 19:01.480
Cheers!

19:14.360 --> 19:15.720
Go away!

19:15.720 --> 19:16.880
Bosses!

19:16.880 --> 19:18.080
Go away!

19:18.080 --> 19:19.560
Jerks!

19:19.560 --> 19:20.840
Go away!

19:20.840 --> 19:21.840
Overtime!

19:22.360 --> 19:23.680
Go away!

19:23.680 --> 19:24.800
Smog!

19:25.080 --> 19:26.720
Go away!

19:28.480 --> 19:29.560
Landlord...

19:45.520 --> 19:48.160
You don't have to start over
after every breakup.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.600
Save it for the next guy.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.120
It works just the same.

19:51.120 --> 19:51.880
Exactly.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.480
This is your...

19:53.480 --> 19:55.120
third time taking it apart right?

19:56.480 --> 19:57.520
Fourth.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.640
You ain't cool enough.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.240
Well,

20:12.240 --> 20:13.720
you seriously lack culture, dude.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.480
Do I really need to explain myself?

20:25.520 --> 20:27.280
Let the past be the past.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.880
I bought a blouse online.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.160
It's gorgeous!

20:30.160 --> 20:31.480
I gotta show it to you guys.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.440
Hold on a second.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.840
Narcissist.

20:39.760 --> 20:40.720
Xiong!

20:44.240 --> 20:45.000
Xiong!

20:54.680 --> 20:55.720
Xiong Dun!

20:55.720 --> 20:56.560
Xiong Dun!

[Peking University International Hospital]

23:39.160 --> 23:40.640
Show this to the chief please.

23:40.640 --> 23:41.360
OK.

23:50.280 --> 23:53.200
Judging from his big eyes and long eyelashes,

23:53.560 --> 23:56.640
there's an 80% chance he's hot.

23:59.720 --> 24:00.640
You are awake.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.440
What are you looking at?

24:07.440 --> 24:08.840
Don't pretend to be innocent,
after that punch...

24:09.920 --> 24:10.840
Did I do that?

24:12.040 --> 24:13.000
Some punch.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.560
Almost sent me flying.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.520
Oops, sorry.

24:18.040 --> 24:18.880
Does this hurt?

24:19.200 --> 24:20.160
No.

24:21.720 --> 24:22.920
Do I need to take off my bra?

24:24.320 --> 24:25.160
No.

24:25.160 --> 24:25.920
This is fine.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.200
Doctor. Test results.

24:36.680 --> 24:37.920
Boxing champ is awake.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.320
Let's do a biopsy too.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.800
Before we have a diagnosis, I suggest

25:02.800 --> 25:04.000
you stay here for monitoring.

25:05.800 --> 25:06.800
Stay...here at the hospital?

25:08.320 --> 25:09.480
And you're responsible for me?

25:09.480 --> 25:10.680
What's your name?

25:11.640 --> 25:12.920
My name is Dr. Liang.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.680
A spot just opened up.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.600
I'm going to get you an inpatient
form to fill out.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.040
Rest up.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.280
Did you see him?

25:25.280 --> 25:26.360
Did you see him?

25:26.360 --> 25:27.640
So damn hot!

25:28.040 --> 25:29.360
You guys see his fingers?

25:29.360 --> 25:30.720
Long and sexy.

25:30.720 --> 25:31.520
Hey,

25:31.520 --> 25:32.920
help me figure out,
what sign do you think he is?

25:32.920 --> 25:33.840
Is he married?

25:34.160 --> 25:35.320
You are thinking too much!

25:35.680 --> 25:37.360
You are in the hospital Xiong.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.760
Everything is gonna be okay with you, right?

25:39.040 --> 25:39.880
Maybe not.

25:39.880 --> 25:40.720
You're serious?

25:40.720 --> 25:41.600
Of course not, I'm kidding.

25:41.600 --> 25:42.280
Go to my place,

25:42.280 --> 25:43.760
and bring me my best mascara.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.440
And in my closet,
the first one on the left.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.320
The red dress,

25:46.320 --> 25:47.520
the one that shows my goodies.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.400
Get these for me,

25:49.400 --> 25:51.840
and I'll be just fine.

25:57.600 --> 25:58.640
Nurse,

25:58.640 --> 26:00.200
who's gonna do my check up?

26:00.200 --> 26:01.080
Is it gonna hurt?

26:01.360 --> 26:02.240
Should be boss Liang.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.320
It's usually him.

26:04.280 --> 26:05.240
Boss?

26:05.240 --> 26:06.280
You mean Dr. Liang?

26:06.280 --> 26:07.040
Yeah.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.600
He's the boss?

26:09.320 --> 26:10.160
He's not,

26:10.160 --> 26:11.640
but because he's always so serious,

26:11.640 --> 26:13.920
we got used to it.
Calling him the boss.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.280
Maybe it's because he grew up abroad,

26:16.280 --> 26:17.760
none of us seem to have things to say with him.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.640
Do I need to undress for this?

26:20.640 --> 26:21.480
Of course.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.400
Really?

26:23.120 --> 26:24.240
You don't have to do it now.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.480
Wait till he gets here.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.080
Alright.

Come here.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.520
Who told you to get off your bed?

28:14.120 --> 28:15.160
You're bed 23?

28:16.000 --> 28:16.800
Hello.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.040
Mao Dou,

28:18.480 --> 28:19.720
say hi to this nice lady.

28:19.720 --> 28:21.640
Oh no, that's alright.

28:21.640 --> 28:22.800
Your name is Mao Dou?

28:22.800 --> 28:24.000
You're so adorable.

28:25.160 --> 28:25.920
What's your name?

28:26.320 --> 28:27.520
My last name is Xiong.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.120
Xiong, like a bear.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.000
Bear!

28:31.240 --> 28:32.480
Stop it.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.880
Okay, go play with big sister.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.120
I'm going to pay the bill.

28:40.520 --> 28:41.600
What does your dad do?

28:41.840 --> 28:44.040
My daddy does big business!

28:44.360 --> 28:45.920
Big... business?

29:03.560 --> 29:06.280
Bear!

29:07.920 --> 29:09.160
You little brat.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.520
Aren't you full of energy.
Isn't that right.

29:10.520 --> 29:12.080
Come here, let's fight.

29:13.640 --> 29:15.840
Xiong Dun, right?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.280
Are you okay here?

29:18.520 --> 29:19.480
Are you sleeping well?

29:20.120 --> 29:21.400
Everything is fine.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.520
How do you feel?

29:25.200 --> 29:26.720
My chest feels a little tight.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.280
And sometimes,

29:30.480 --> 29:31.400
I want to cough.

29:32.360 --> 29:33.400
If you could come

29:33.400 --> 29:34.640
and visit me more often,

29:34.640 --> 29:36.160
then I'd feel a lot better.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.640
If you come visit me more often,

29:40.640 --> 29:42.280
I'd feel a lot better.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.680
Little brat!

29:45.840 --> 29:47.520
Mao Dou, stop copying what adults say.

29:47.520 --> 29:48.640
- Got it?
- Bear,

29:48.640 --> 29:49.640
stop copying what adults say.

29:49.640 --> 29:50.400
Got it?

29:52.760 --> 29:53.600
Dr. Liang.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.120
Get some rest.

30:03.280 --> 30:06.720
Boy. You are a boy.

30:06.720 --> 30:08.440
You don't have boobs, so you are a boy.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.120
See, they're right here.

30:16.120 --> 30:16.640
Fake.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.600
If my daddy squeezed hard enough,
he'd have them too.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.120
Boys have them too, so we know
what's front and what's back.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.520
Are yours for the same reason?

30:25.080 --> 30:25.680
Xiong,

30:26.000 --> 30:27.840
how can you stand this kid?

30:27.840 --> 30:29.560
Now you feel my pain...

30:30.280 --> 30:31.720
It's time for my examination,

30:31.720 --> 30:33.320
you guys can take off anytime you want.

30:33.320 --> 30:34.600
Bring me some yummy food tonight.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.400
Sure thing.

30:38.040 --> 30:39.520
What are you looking at? Go away.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.000
Mao Dou, I'll play with you.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.760
Let's sword fight.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.640
What, am I wrong for telling you

30:54.120 --> 30:54.840
not to smoke in the room?

30:54.840 --> 30:55.480
This is a hospital.

30:55.480 --> 30:56.640
What's your problem?

30:57.320 --> 30:58.640
I was smoking in the bathroom.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.320
That's still in the hospital.

31:00.320 --> 31:01.520
The smoke goes everywhere.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.360
I don't care what you do.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.680
If you don't care if you die, that's your
problem. We don't want to die.

31:04.680 --> 31:05.640
No manners.

31:05.640 --> 31:06.920
No morals.

31:10.560 --> 31:11.480
Happy?

31:12.080 --> 31:13.520
What is your problem?

31:13.520 --> 31:15.280
Forget it. There're
a lot of people watching.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.640
- Let's go.
- I don't want that.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.120
- Let me tell you...
- Mom...

31:31.560 --> 31:32.800
Try not to move,

31:33.200 --> 31:34.520
no matter how painful it is.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.080
Otherwise we have to do it over again,

31:37.480 --> 31:38.800
and it'll hurt even more.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.120
First time is always the worst.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.320
You'll get use to it.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.800
Let me help you.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.240
I can distract you from the pain.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.680
Bear, tell me a story.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.840
That's a crappy solution.

32:04.360 --> 32:05.120
I'm hurting my butt off,

32:05.120 --> 32:06.360
and you want me to tell you a story?

32:06.360 --> 32:07.440
You got no sympathy kid.

32:07.440 --> 32:08.160
No, I don't...

32:08.160 --> 32:09.600
What's sympathy?

32:12.320 --> 32:14.200
C'mon, tell me a story.

32:18.440 --> 32:19.680
I'm bleeding.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.800
The doctor told me not to bleed.

32:22.360 --> 32:23.160
Lie down.

32:23.520 --> 32:24.400
Hurry.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.720
What happened?

32:31.720 --> 32:33.160
This is exactly what we were worrying about.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.120
I tripped and fell.

32:36.480 --> 32:37.680
Okay. Lie still.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.760
Stop talking.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.120
Stay on your bed,
and don't move around so much.

32:45.440 --> 32:46.360
Don't worry,

32:46.360 --> 32:48.560
I won't tell my dad.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.040
Thanks.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.160
Mao Dou,

32:53.720 --> 32:55.320
do you know what you have?

32:55.680 --> 32:56.360
I don't know.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.080
But after I got shots,

32:58.400 --> 33:00.080
all my hair fell off.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.880
Acute myeloid leukemia.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.240
Lymphocytic leukemia.

33:10.920 --> 33:13.200
Chronic granulocytic leukemia.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.360
[Miss you forever]

33:16.920 --> 33:18.200
No way...

34:14.280 --> 34:15.719
I won't let you die.

34:16.280 --> 34:17.679
Don't ever leave me.

34:18.400 --> 34:19.800
You are a heartless girl!

34:20.199 --> 34:21.159
Oppa...

34:21.719 --> 34:23.520
I have one last wish.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.440
I'd fulfill not one,

34:26.159 --> 34:26.840
but a hundred,

34:27.360 --> 34:28.000
a thousand,

34:28.360 --> 34:29.920
or even a million of your wishes.

34:31.120 --> 34:32.520
Tell me!

35:07.120 --> 35:08.600
I'm sorry.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.000
What do you think of my cleavage?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Sexy enough?

35:13.240 --> 35:14.640
You think I should pull it down more?

35:15.160 --> 35:16.440
More?

35:16.440 --> 35:18.400
Any further and I'd see your belly button.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.200
Although I must say, your persistence

35:22.200 --> 35:23.720
really is quite moving.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.480
But this is a hospital.

35:26.480 --> 35:27.480
Come on, nowadays,

35:27.480 --> 35:28.800
love has no boundaries.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.600
Why would time or place stand in my way?

35:30.600 --> 35:31.600
Remember, a woman needs to

35:31.600 --> 35:33.000
always, always,

35:33.000 --> 35:34.560
stay beautiful, both inside and out.

35:34.840 --> 35:35.640
Therefore,

35:35.640 --> 35:36.520
If you were to get hit by a car,

35:36.520 --> 35:39.600
they would always rescue
the pretty ones first.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.400
Never mind,
you wouldn't understand it anyways.

36:31.080 --> 36:32.200
Are you still coughing?

36:32.200 --> 36:32.840
Yes.

36:44.480 --> 36:45.400
That's him right there.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.400
Liang Junbo.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.200
Let's go find this Liang guy.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.480
Yeah, that's right.

36:51.480 --> 36:52.520
Take a picture.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.240
Zoom in more.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.160
Don't look back!

37:01.160 --> 37:02.480
Don't ask why. Just come with me.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.080
Why are you dressed like this?

37:04.080 --> 37:04.880
Don't say anything.

37:06.480 --> 37:07.480
Hurry! Hurry up!

37:11.280 --> 37:12.400
Oh my God!

37:12.400 --> 37:13.600
That was really close.

37:13.920 --> 37:16.520
There are these scary guys looking for you.

37:16.840 --> 37:17.880
Looking... for me?

37:18.200 --> 37:20.520
But I've always been good to my patients.

37:20.800 --> 37:21.840
Yeah, but misunderstandings do happen.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.040
It's not always up to you.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.240
Are you wearing perfume?

37:30.040 --> 37:30.760
Yep.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.480
You like it?

37:33.160 --> 37:34.040
You are...

37:34.040 --> 37:35.000
not thinking about

37:35.000 --> 37:35.680
leaving the hospital right?

37:36.000 --> 37:36.920
Nah.

37:40.080 --> 37:40.920
Look at my eyes,

37:40.920 --> 37:42.760
I've got fake lashes on too.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.080
You...

37:46.080 --> 37:46.800
Putting on makeup

37:46.800 --> 37:48.920
would affect my judgments of your condition.

37:49.760 --> 37:50.480
For example,

37:50.480 --> 37:51.200
looking at a patient's eyes,

37:51.200 --> 37:52.600
and nails,

37:53.040 --> 37:54.640
to determine the state of a patient's illness.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.800
Initial observations are very important
for a doctor's diagnosis.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.480
I understand.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.160
Even without makeup,

38:05.480 --> 38:06.720
you're still pretty.

38:07.480 --> 38:08.560
Really?

38:08.560 --> 38:10.280
So, you like the makeup-free me huh?

38:10.680 --> 38:12.000
I think a lot of women

38:12.000 --> 38:13.800
are actually prettier
when they don't wear makeup.

38:14.840 --> 38:15.680
Oh...

38:23.800 --> 38:25.120
Dr. Liang.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.480
Your heart is racing.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.840
Are you alright?

38:32.600 --> 38:33.680
Hypoxia.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.360
A lack of oxygen will

38:36.360 --> 38:37.760
cause an increase in heart rate.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.360
Is it me, or is it a little stuffy in here?

38:41.520 --> 38:42.600
They should be gone by now, right?

38:42.600 --> 38:43.320
Wait! Hold on a second.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.240
Let me listen.

38:44.240 --> 38:45.080
Just a minute.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.280
It's so hot in here.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.400
<i>The biggest tragedy in life is...</i>

39:29.400 --> 39:31.200
<i>when you should have held it in,</i>

39:31.200 --> 39:32.120
<i>but you didn't.</i>

39:38.600 --> 39:40.440
This is... not what it looks like.

39:41.120 --> 39:41.760
C'mon, let's go.

39:41.760 --> 39:42.480
Didn't see anything.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.480
We didn't see anything.

39:43.480 --> 39:44.760
Even in a place like that.

39:46.080 --> 39:48.000
It really isn't... what you are thinking.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.480
Let me go sort this out.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.400
Will you please go back and lie down?

39:54.400 --> 39:55.480
Please.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.640
Liang Junbo.

39:58.480 --> 39:59.520
What do you want?

39:59.520 --> 40:01.120
I've been watching you three for a while now.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.040
This is a civilized society.

40:02.040 --> 40:02.640
What?

40:02.640 --> 40:04.320
You wanna play rough?

40:04.320 --> 40:05.680
It's a misunderstanding.
Misunderstanding?

40:05.680 --> 40:06.360
You are...

40:06.360 --> 40:07.240
Dr. Liang,

40:07.240 --> 40:08.480
Mao Dou's oncologist?

40:10.440 --> 40:11.000
Yes.

40:11.000 --> 40:11.880
What's the matter?

40:12.880 --> 40:14.440
We are Cui's friends.

40:14.840 --> 40:15.480
We heard that

40:15.480 --> 40:17.200
Mao Dou is going to have an operation.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.080
So, we collected some money for Cui.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.120
We were afraid that he wouldn't accept it,

40:20.120 --> 40:20.920
so it's better to

40:20.920 --> 40:22.000
just give it to you directly.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.160
Mao Dou's cross-matching

40:26.560 --> 40:27.760
was unsuccessful.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.480
He can go home for the time being.

40:38.680 --> 40:39.480
Daddy,

40:39.480 --> 40:41.400
I don't want to grow up,

40:41.800 --> 40:42.440
that way,

40:42.440 --> 40:44.320
you will never get old.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.200
Silly boy,

40:46.200 --> 40:46.800
did you forget?

40:46.800 --> 40:47.840
Dad knows magic.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.640
When you grow up,

40:49.640 --> 40:50.720
I'll use magic

40:50.720 --> 40:52.200
to make myself as young as you.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.400
Then why can't you cure me?

41:01.080 --> 41:02.480
Promise me you'll sleep well tonight.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.160
Comes tomorrow morning,

41:04.160 --> 41:05.440
I will use my powers

41:05.440 --> 41:06.640
to get you out of here,
and bring you home.

41:06.640 --> 41:07.360
Really?

41:07.360 --> 41:08.160
Really!

41:08.160 --> 41:10.760
- I can go home now!
- Yes.

41:10.760 --> 41:11.600
Yep, let's go home.

41:11.600 --> 41:15.040
I can leave and go home now!

41:15.040 --> 41:18.800
Bear! I can leave now!

41:34.760 --> 41:36.800
<i>I have never met Mao Dou's mother,</i>

41:36.800 --> 41:38.920
<i>nor have I heard about Cui's story.</i>

41:39.480 --> 41:40.640
<i>But there's one thing I know for sure,</i>

41:41.240 --> 41:42.440
<i>he is a wonderful father.</i>

42:08.120 --> 42:08.920
Xiong,

42:08.920 --> 42:11.240
you must be mad,

42:11.680 --> 42:13.920
because I get to get better before you do.

42:15.320 --> 42:16.720
Oh it's the worst.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.240
Without you here
messing with me all the time,

42:18.240 --> 42:19.640
I'd feel lonely.

42:20.280 --> 42:22.560
Xiong, are you going to die?

42:27.200 --> 42:28.720
Do you know what dying is?

42:29.080 --> 42:29.720
Of course I do.

42:29.720 --> 42:31.760
Dying is just sleeping for a long, long time.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.480
It's what my grandma told me.

42:34.240 --> 42:36.080
Then, are you afraid of sleeping
for a really, really long lime?

42:36.760 --> 42:39.040
I like sleeping, it's comfortable.

42:39.040 --> 42:41.040
And I wouldn't have to get shots.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.400
I'd wake up eventually.

42:42.400 --> 42:43.240
Right?

42:45.400 --> 42:46.000
Yes.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.280
Right. You will wakeup one day, for sure.

42:49.440 --> 42:52.040
Xiong, can you tell me a story?

42:52.040 --> 42:54.240
I promise I will never bully with you again.

42:56.840 --> 42:57.720
Sure.

42:59.520 --> 43:01.320
Storytime!

43:03.480 --> 43:06.200
Let's see... what story should I tell?

43:07.920 --> 43:09.160
A long,

43:09.160 --> 43:10.720
long time ago,

43:11.200 --> 43:13.880
there was a little boy who knew magic.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.040
His name was Mao Dou.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.160
Hey, he has the same name as me.

43:17.160 --> 43:18.000
Yep, that's right.

43:20.200 --> 43:21.520
One day,

43:21.760 --> 43:22.480
Mao Dou

43:22.480 --> 43:25.800
had awoken from a beautiful, sweet dream,

43:26.360 --> 43:28.720
and realized the world around
him was perfectly tranquil.

43:29.280 --> 43:30.080
The sky,

43:30.080 --> 43:31.600
was unbelievably blue.

43:32.280 --> 43:33.200
Mao Dou

43:33.200 --> 43:34.880
was wearing the coolest,

43:34.880 --> 43:36.560
newest clothing.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.000
He ran through the streets,

43:38.000 --> 43:39.160
he ran,

43:39.400 --> 43:40.520
jumped,

43:42.080 --> 43:43.400
and ran,

43:43.720 --> 43:46.240
until he came to a garden.

43:47.040 --> 43:48.480
Inside that garden,

43:48.480 --> 43:51.480
there were beautiful,
colorful flowers everywhere.

43:51.480 --> 43:52.680
There were few different kinds...

44:07.480 --> 44:08.480
A monster appeared,

44:08.480 --> 44:09.560
Mao Dou struck back.

44:13.440 --> 44:14.200
Do you like it?

44:14.920 --> 44:15.800
Here, for you.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.000
This is awesome. Thank you Xiong!

44:21.760 --> 44:23.640
Let me tell you a secret.

44:23.640 --> 44:26.760
Dr. Liang's girlfriend died from a disease!

44:28.640 --> 44:29.280
It's true.

44:29.280 --> 44:30.680
I heard it from the head nurse.

44:30.680 --> 44:31.720
She's so scary,

44:31.720 --> 44:33.080
I don't think she tells lies.

44:33.640 --> 44:35.680
I can only help you so much,

44:35.680 --> 44:38.000
the rest is up to you.

44:47.800 --> 44:48.840
Mao Dou.

44:48.840 --> 44:49.760
Let's go home.

44:52.120 --> 44:52.920
Let's go.

44:52.920 --> 44:53.680
Time to go home!

44:56.000 --> 44:57.200
Bye-bye!
Bye-bye!

44:59.080 --> 45:00.000
Let's go.

45:04.880 --> 45:07.000
<i>Sometimes, living in your own imagination</i>

45:07.600 --> 45:09.560
<i>is a rather wonderful thing.</i>

45:10.440 --> 45:12.400
<i>You wouldn't have a worry in the world.</i>

45:12.840 --> 45:14.080
<i>No fears.</i>

45:14.360 --> 45:15.480
<i>No grief.</i>

45:16.120 --> 45:17.600
<i>Not even death.</i>

45:28.720 --> 45:30.000
It's you.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.240
Why are you out so late?

45:33.200 --> 45:34.480
I couldn't sleep.

45:34.480 --> 45:36.120
I came out for some moon-bathing.

45:36.800 --> 45:37.800
No way...

45:38.360 --> 45:39.760
The nurse tells me that

45:39.760 --> 45:41.200
out of all the patients,

45:41.200 --> 45:42.360
you are the one who eats the most,

45:42.360 --> 45:43.040
and sleeps the best.

45:44.520 --> 45:46.160
Who told you that?

45:46.160 --> 45:47.600
Bad mouthing me on purpose.

45:48.080 --> 45:50.080
She's obviously jealous of my stunning looks.

45:55.480 --> 45:57.640
Do I have the same disease as Mao Dou?

46:03.520 --> 46:04.600
Patients

46:04.600 --> 46:05.720
must avoid

46:06.040 --> 46:07.560
thinking too much.

46:08.480 --> 46:09.480
It's like this.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.120
It's my responsibility to treat you,

46:11.480 --> 46:12.800
and it's your responsibility to believe in me.

46:13.320 --> 46:14.640
Let's wait for the results to come in.

46:15.320 --> 46:17.240
So, I'm really gonna believe you now.

46:17.640 --> 46:18.880
My life

46:18.880 --> 46:20.120
is in your hands now.

46:20.640 --> 46:21.680
Pinkie swear.

46:23.480 --> 46:24.560
You don't know pinkie swear?

46:24.560 --> 46:26.040
Even a 3 years old would know.

46:26.440 --> 46:27.560
Here, like this,

46:27.560 --> 46:28.480
then, stamp.

46:30.880 --> 46:32.200
This way, if you don't keep your promise,

46:32.720 --> 46:33.840
I will curse you

46:34.160 --> 46:35.520
to remain single for the rest of your life.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.440
That's harsh.

46:40.600 --> 46:42.080
How long have you been a doctor?

46:43.120 --> 46:44.240
Seven years now.

46:45.680 --> 46:46.360
What about you?

46:46.360 --> 46:47.840
What do you do?

46:48.760 --> 46:49.560
Right now,

46:49.560 --> 46:51.280
I draw to make a living.

46:51.720 --> 46:52.840
Artist...

46:53.480 --> 46:54.640
That's good.

46:54.880 --> 46:56.320
Better than us.

46:56.800 --> 46:58.520
It's tough being a doctor.

46:58.520 --> 46:59.760
There's always so much risk involved,

46:59.760 --> 47:01.240
but rarely a sense of accomplishment.

47:01.480 --> 47:02.200
That's easy.

47:02.200 --> 47:03.560
Treat me!

47:03.560 --> 47:05.800
I'm the best at making people
feel accomplished.

47:06.440 --> 47:07.920
How can you do it?

47:08.280 --> 47:09.560
I feel like anything

47:09.560 --> 47:11.720
and everything can make you happy.

47:11.720 --> 47:12.800
I'm silly.

47:13.360 --> 47:14.320
When I was in college,

47:14.320 --> 47:15.640
no one took me seriously.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.480
Happy or not,

47:17.480 --> 47:18.840
we still got to live on, one day at a time.

47:18.840 --> 47:20.400
So just live life to its fullest,
without a care in the world.

47:21.400 --> 47:22.160
Yeah.

47:22.560 --> 47:23.520
That makes sense.

47:24.200 --> 47:25.880
If it makes sense,
then why are you still so serious?

47:28.400 --> 47:29.480
That's right!

47:30.000 --> 47:31.280
You have no idea how important

47:31.280 --> 47:32.480
a doctor's smile can be

47:32.480 --> 47:34.040
for us patients.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.520
So take it from me,

47:35.840 --> 47:38.160
learn to smile and grin
at yourself in the mirror.

47:38.680 --> 47:40.320
Because when you smile,

47:40.320 --> 47:42.080
you're so handsome,
you make me wanna take off...

47:43.640 --> 47:46.200
<i>I really want to slap myself a few limes.</i>

47:48.200 --> 47:50.120
Watch your mouth!

47:52.480 --> 47:53.560
Take off my old identity and be reborn again.

47:54.640 --> 47:55.920
You wanted to say,

47:55.920 --> 47:57.000
take off your clothes?

48:06.480 --> 48:07.360
Hello?

48:07.880 --> 48:08.520
OK.

48:08.520 --> 48:09.720
OK. I'll be right there.

48:11.480 --> 48:13.240
It's been fun talking to you.

48:13.240 --> 48:14.240
I gotta go work.

48:14.240 --> 48:15.160
Get some sleep.

48:40.720 --> 48:43.440
You guys should contact
Xiong Dun's parents soon.

48:43.840 --> 48:45.560
It's better if they are here.

48:45.560 --> 48:47.080
What does she have?

48:47.440 --> 48:48.360
Her condition

48:48.800 --> 48:50.000
is very complicated.

48:51.080 --> 48:53.000
So it's best if her parents are here,

48:53.320 --> 48:54.240
so we could talk about it together.

48:54.240 --> 48:54.920
Ok?

48:55.200 --> 48:57.080
Please tell us how she's doing,

48:57.080 --> 48:58.640
so we'll have an idea of what to prepare for.

48:58.640 --> 49:00.360
I know you care about her a lot.

49:00.360 --> 49:01.080
Dr. Liang please don't move.

49:01.080 --> 49:02.080
Don't move at all.

49:02.080 --> 49:03.520
Here is the thing,
this is for your own good.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.000
She was once the biggest badass
of our neighborhood.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.440
They used to call her Miss Tyson.

49:13.480 --> 49:15.800
[Diagnosis: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma)

49:26.640 --> 49:27.800
I don't think

49:27.800 --> 49:29.040
we should tell her

49:29.040 --> 49:30.400
unless it's absolutely necessary.

49:31.120 --> 49:32.600
What if she couldn't handle it,

49:32.600 --> 49:33.520
and just... gives up hope altogether.

49:34.120 --> 49:34.840
Xiao Xia,

49:35.520 --> 49:37.080
if you were the one who's sick,

49:37.080 --> 49:38.280
would you rather find out now,

49:38.280 --> 49:39.200
or later,

49:39.200 --> 49:40.360
or be kept in the dark the whole time?

49:41.760 --> 49:43.600
If it was me,

49:44.840 --> 49:46.160
I would rather know it

49:46.160 --> 49:47.240
sooner...

49:47.240 --> 49:47.840
Never mind.

49:47.840 --> 49:48.840
I don't think you should ask me anymore.

49:48.840 --> 49:49.480
Okay, that's enough.

49:49.480 --> 49:50.560
You can never decide on anything,

49:50.560 --> 49:51.520
it's useless asking you.

49:51.520 --> 49:53.280
How about we vote on it?

49:53.280 --> 49:54.600
Raise your hand if you agree to tell her now.

49:57.520 --> 49:59.320
Xiao Xia, are you going to
raise your hand or not?

50:08.280 --> 50:09.440
Why are you here?

50:09.440 --> 50:11.720
I am starving.

50:12.680 --> 50:13.760
Excuse me.

50:14.600 --> 50:16.280
Hello. Can I help you?

50:16.280 --> 50:17.680
This one.

50:18.200 --> 50:18.920
This too.

50:19.320 --> 50:20.280
Quickly.

50:20.280 --> 50:21.360
OK. It'll be right out.

50:21.360 --> 50:22.160
Thanks.

50:22.600 --> 50:23.400
Are you crazy?

50:23.400 --> 50:24.160
Can you eat all that?

50:25.000 --> 50:27.520
I mean you only live once right,

50:27.520 --> 50:28.480
one meal eaten

50:28.480 --> 50:29.560
is one meal less.

50:40.200 --> 50:41.160
I want to

50:41.160 --> 50:42.920
tell you guys something.

50:44.000 --> 50:44.800
I really

50:45.280 --> 50:46.120
hit the jackpot this time.

50:46.440 --> 50:47.240
200 million?

50:47.480 --> 50:49.520
Dude, where is the context?
Pay attention please.

50:51.840 --> 50:52.800
So you know?

50:54.320 --> 50:56.440
It was cleverness that
killed the cat, not curiosity.

50:59.720 --> 51:00.400
Xiong,

51:00.640 --> 51:02.440
we've asked around.

51:02.440 --> 51:03.440
It's not that big of a deal.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.360
On a tumor scale,

51:05.360 --> 51:06.760
this only ranks number 10 on the chart.

51:07.800 --> 51:08.680
Tumor?

51:09.360 --> 51:10.360
What tumor?

51:12.240 --> 51:13.520
I thought you already knew?

51:14.120 --> 51:15.440
I have a tumor?

51:16.520 --> 51:17.680
It's not leukemia?

51:19.760 --> 51:20.800
Oh thank god!

51:21.200 --> 51:22.640
I thought I had leukemia!

51:22.640 --> 51:23.440
Really.

51:23.760 --> 51:24.840
Thank God!

51:24.840 --> 51:25.840
And Buddha!

51:30.160 --> 51:31.320
Why do you look so worried?

51:32.280 --> 51:33.560
It's a tumor...

51:33.560 --> 51:34.640
Just cut it off!

51:39.000 --> 51:40.120
From now on,

51:40.400 --> 51:41.440
I'm gonna be healthy!

51:41.440 --> 51:42.640
No more laziness.

51:42.640 --> 51:43.840
No more junk food.

51:43.840 --> 51:44.760
When I'm all better,

51:44.760 --> 51:45.560
I'm going to workout everyday,

51:45.560 --> 51:46.400
for two hours.

51:47.080 --> 51:47.800
No, for three hours!

51:48.400 --> 51:49.320

an IV injection,

52:00.720 --> 52:02.360
You totally know her.

52:03.080 --> 52:04.280
Look at her.

52:04.560 --> 52:05.360
"It's a tumor."

52:05.360 --> 52:06.640
"Just cut it off."

52:07.200 --> 52:07.880
Come on dude!

52:07.880 --> 52:10.120
Have you forgotten all your bio classes?

52:11.160 --> 52:12.400
It's lymphoma.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.200
Lymph nodes are all over the body.

52:15.040 --> 52:15.920
Cut it off?

52:15.920 --> 52:17.440
How about I cut you off!

52:29.520 --> 52:30.720
What are you looking for?

52:31.040 --> 52:32.400
Xiong Dun wants to watch "The Walking Dead'.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.560
I made a DVD for her last time.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.680
Why can't I find it?

52:34.680 --> 52:36.120
And her comic books too.

52:37.120 --> 52:38.320
Come get something to eat first.

52:38.320 --> 52:39.640
You didn't eat much for lunch.

52:40.800 --> 52:42.120
you too, come eat something.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.040
Are you ok?

52:50.680 --> 52:52.360
How can I be ok?

52:54.120 --> 52:56.400

57:00.360 --> 57:01.440
Liar.

57:02.720 --> 57:03.560
Bamboo eight.

57:04.080 --> 57:04.800
Hello?

57:04.800 --> 57:06.400
Mr, Xiong, please don't hang up.

57:06.400 --> 57:08.000
Xiong Dun shaved her head when she was six.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
When she was seven,
she tried to shave like you,

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
and cut her lips.

57:10.000 --> 57:10.720
And one summer,

57:10.720 --> 57:12.640
your brought her to a farm to watch
an irrigation plane,

57:12.640 --> 57:13.720
but almost lost her.

57:13.720 --> 57:15.120
And also, before she turned 16,

57:15.120 --> 57:17.160
she weight the heaviest at 180 pounds.

57:17.160 --> 57:17.920
Who is this?

57:18.400 --> 57:19.600
Let my daughter go!

57:26.600 --> 57:27.600
This is

57:28.000 --> 57:29.400
a systemic disease.

57:30.240 --> 57:31.840
It's very hard to treat.

57:32.280 --> 57:33.040
Within 5 years,

57:33.040 --> 57:34.000
the survival rate

57:34.000 --> 57:35.560
is no more than 20 percent.

57:36.720 --> 57:38.640
What we can do now is

57:38.640 --> 57:40.400
sessions of systematic chemotherapy

57:41.040 --> 57:42.800
to prolong life.

57:43.760 --> 57:46.040
However,

57:46.040 --> 57:46.760
migraines,

57:46.760 --> 57:47.840
hair loss.

57:48.800 --> 57:50.560
These are side effects of the chemo.

57:50.560 --> 57:51.240
So,

57:51.240 --> 57:52.400
don't be too nervous.

57:54.040 --> 57:56.760
Our goal for late stage cancer patients is

57:57.440 --> 57:59.200
to improve their quality of life

57:59.880 --> 58:01.680
and prolong the time they have left.

58:32.320 --> 58:33.920
Go be with her.

58:34.240 --> 58:35.280
I'm going...

58:35.640 --> 58:36.880
buy some stuff.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.440
It's not a big problem.
You'll get better.

59:52.440 --> 59:53.640
You are always too rebellious

59:53.640 --> 59:54.760
Do you remember?

59:54.760 --> 59:56.920
What I tell you every time I call you.

59:56.920 --> 59:58.520
You have to eat well,

59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.000
and wrap yourself up when it's cold.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.440
You always wear so little.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.640
You never listen...

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.000
You always sleep so late,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.880
and wake up even later.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.240
You'd draw for hours and hours,

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.720
without eating or drinking.
Nobody could take that.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.040
What happened to your mouth?

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.080
Give it to me!

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.280
Give it to me!

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.160
How many times have I told you?

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.560
Your father's side has a history of diabetes,

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.520
you can't eat too many sweets.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.320
Maybe you got sick from

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.800
all this carelessness.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.240
Please stop nagging me.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.640
I'm already like this.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.240
It's only a piece of chocolate.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.000
I'm sorry.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.480
I won't eat it again.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.240
You have to change.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.040
Listen to me,

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:41.720
to get well,

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.880
you should come back home.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.400
Stop messing around in this city.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.560
I'm not going back.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.160
I've just started my career here.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.680
What career?

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.440
It's been how many years
since you've graduated?

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.680
You're still living like this.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.120
If you don't go back,

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.280
your dad and I will sell the new apartment

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.120
and move here to live with you.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.480
That would drive me crazy, mom.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.280
You taking care of yourself drives us crazy.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.000
OK.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.240
Who's up?

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.920
Do not look at the records.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.480
Through two mediastinal biopsies,

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.360
the pathology shows

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.720
non Hodgkin's lymphoma

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.240
and mediastinal large B cell lymphoma.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.920
PET-CT shows a high metabolite of
the anterior mediastinal

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.480
has infected parts of the lung

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.440
and pericardium.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.240
We are starting two cycles of MA chemotherapy.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.040
After two cycles,

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.600
the evaluation is...

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.120
The evaluation is PR.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.440
It's important to be familiar

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.560
with a patient's conditions.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.800
This is fundamental.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.640
Especially with the patient's specificity,

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.720
you have to remember it all the time.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.480
From now on, no one is allowed to

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.440
read from the records when visiting patients.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.440
Xiong Dun,

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.560
how do you feel?

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.640
I'm fine.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.040
Are your urination and defecation normal?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.560
Why are you ask a girl such question
this early in the morning?

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.760
Stop fooling around.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.760
The doctor is talking to you, be serious.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.560
Normal.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.280
I thought no one could control you.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.000
Why do I need to be controlled?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.200
I'm a really well-behaved girl.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.480
I think you're really imposing today,

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.440
kind of like the mob boss.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.040
Are they all afraid of you?

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.040
Why would they be afraid of me?

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.440
I don't bite.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.800
Are you guys afraid of me?

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.760
No.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.040
Why are you laughing?

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.560
Don't just laugh because
someone else is laughing.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.920
Laughter, should come from the heart.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.360
Right? Xiong Dun.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.600
Yep.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.160
This is Xia Meng.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.480
Who's turn is it?

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.200
I'll do it.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.720
Xia Meng's immunophenotype is

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.000
B-PLL.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.800
Her peripheral leukocytes are
more than hundred thousand.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.840
The bone marrow is diffused
by naive lymphocytes.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.720
They are also present in other organs.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.120
We've been using the CHOP plan,

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.280
once every three weeks.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.400
And CTX,

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.360
for one day.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.080
And VCR

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.640
with a maximum no more than 2 mg.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.880
Also, she's been taking PDN separately,

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.280
60 mg each day.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.760
- You can't leave.
- Let go.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:07.600
What do you mean?

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.520
You've already pissed off all my friends.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.840
And I'm the one who has to clean
your mess every time.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.320
Come on, what do you want from me?

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.360
How can you just leave my stuff?

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.400
Don't leave me like this!

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.400
You know I'm sick,

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.720
how can you just abandon me like this?

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.160
Let go of me.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:19.880
No.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.280
Wu Xiaoliang!

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.360
You jerk!

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.560
Jerk!

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.320
What are you going?

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.440
What the hell?

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.400
Listen to me,

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.480
there are three things in life
you should never touch.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.120
Drugs.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:24.760
Prostitution.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.280
And jumping off buildings!

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.520
Jump?

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.880
From this height?

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.520
I'll probably die faster if I don't jump.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.040
You want some?

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.600
You got enough?

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.360
First, I lost my job.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.160
Then, I lost my relationship.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.440
And now, even health has abandoned me.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.520
I still haven't told my parents

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.240
about that son of a bitch ex-boyfriend yet.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.400
You are afraid to tell them.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.800
Me? I've got no one to tell it to.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.320
I don't even remember
what my parents looked like.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.160
Are you afraid?

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.720
Afraid of what?

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:41.720
Afraid of...

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.520
that everyone around us

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.360
have just started living life,

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.760
but ours are already coming to an end.

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:49.760
You have to believe that

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.280
each time god presents us with a challenge,

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.680
he does it for a purpose.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.720
If you've never even had a chance
to come face to face with Death,

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.200
then you've never really lived.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:05:59.840
Right?

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.160
It's not that I'm afraid of dying.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:06.040
It's just...for the past 30 years, I feel like

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.040
I haven't really done anything meaningful.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.080
And if I were to die today,

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.040
I'd be forgotten,

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.440
leaving no traces or impact on this world.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.080
You're missing the point.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.320
Why do you think god planned
for us to get sick?

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.640
He's reminding us that,

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.120
you only have one life to live.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.040
Nobody knows when they'll...

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:22.760
Expire.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.200
Right?

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.120
So it's up to us to cherish everyday,

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:26.880
and make the best use

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.600
of our time...to live the way you want to.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.840
Sometimes, taking a leap and being impulsive,

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.400
would make us regret it for maybe a day or two.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.240
But being a coward...

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.600
that's when you'll regret it for
the rest of your life.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.360
Great.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.280
Good point!

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.920
Here. Cheers!

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.480
Cheers!

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.240
I was 28 years-old,

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.880
living the best days of my youth,

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.480
when my master decided shave my hair.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.080
Alright, stop acting dear.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.040
It's time to test just how beautiful you are.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.240
How can you still be gorgeous
when you're bald?

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.280
I'd probably look like a nun...

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.120
Not fair.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.720
Okay, okay. Stop looking.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.760
The more you look, the harder it's gonna be.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.560
Just close your eyes.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:32.040
Open them only when I tell you to.

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:49.840
Okay, You can open them now.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.680
What did you guys do?

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.680
Surprise!

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.439
Come on,

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.200
let's remember this historical moment!

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.200
Come on,

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.560
Picture time!

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.720
Five hard boiled eggs!

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.280
Rock, paper, scissors!

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.760
Rock, paper, scissors!

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.160
Rock, paper, scissors!

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.120
Sir,

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.160
your dessert.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:25.840
There's more?

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.480
Here, give it here.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.120
I grant to you, an oyster

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.440
It's an aphrodisiac.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.760
Hey, hm...

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:34.600
You guys keep eating,

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.720
I gotta use the bathroom.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.360
- Where are you going?
- Escape.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.680
I gotta go liberate myself too.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.160
Here. Forget about them.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:41.880
Let's drink.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:42.720
Bottoms up.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.560
Cheers.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Xiong is still not back yet?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:00.680
No.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.880
I saw her asshole ex-boyfriend!

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.560
What a small world!

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.320
Both of them are here?

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.000
Yep.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.400
Wonderful.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.480
From the looks of it I'd say,
let's assemble some Avengers tonight.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.000
I'm full.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:25.720
The show is on.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.040
Follow me.

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.360
- Go ahead.
- You handle the girl.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:37.760
Let's dish out our "usual".

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.320
I'm going.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.720
- Alright.
- Trust me.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.200
Go ahead.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.480
Go ahead.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.920
Where are you going?

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.200
Do you know why I'm here?

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.120
Why?

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.880
To tell you the truth,

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.720
when we were together,

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.880
he would always bring me here too.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:16.520
Who are you?

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.520
Who I am is not important.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.520
Give me five minutes,

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.720
I'll make it unforgettable for you.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:22.760
Stop it.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.640
Are you sure this is okay?

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.840
I didn't plan on telling you this,

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.160
<i>but he said,</i>

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.280
<i>that I wasn't his cup of tea.</i>

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.840
<i>He says he likes them buff,</i>

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.000
What are you guys doing?

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.800
<i>...and that I couldn't fulfill him.</i>

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.520
What the f...

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.560
That bitch.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.640
Listen.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:48.760
Did you know,

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.760
when we were together,

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.120
he wasn't just cheating on me with one person.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.040
<i>He'd have three or even four
at the same time.</i>

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.920
Xia deserves an Oscar.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.520
He really likes one of the waiters here.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.880
Tall, strong, and handsome.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.320
The reason I broke up with him was because

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.200
I caught them in the bathroom.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:30.880
Is he?

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.400
In the bathroom again?

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.880
It's up to you now.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.160
Hey.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.640
What are you doing?

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.720
Ladies is this way.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.400
Move.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.680
Naughty boy!

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.240
Sorry.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.480
Honey...

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.240
Honey your ass.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:45.200
And the Best Actor goes to... Xia!

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.080
We are a group of crazy women.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.880
<i>I don't remember who it was that said,</i>

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.720
<i>true friendships are like health,</i>

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.400
<i>you'll only appreciate them,</i>

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.120
<i>when you're about to lose them.</i>

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.760
<i>I can't imagine</i>

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.280
<i>what I'd be</i>

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.600
<i>without them.</i>

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.360
Dun Dun!

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.240
Sweetheart!

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:19.600
Dun Dun!

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.600
Family members, please wait outside.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.680
Let's go.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.240
Where's Dr. Liang?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:25.680
Heart rate increased.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.400
Loss of consciousness.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.280
BP is not reading.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.400
ECG shows ventricular fibrillation.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.720
It should be the ontological syndrome.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.080
Pulse has disappeared.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:38.920
I can't find a heartbeat.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.920
Prepare for defibrillation.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.520
Two pads, at 200 joules.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.120
Charged.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.040
Alright, step back.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.360
Prepare a shot of epinephrine.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.480
1 mg. IV.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.280
1 mg of epinephrine.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.160
Ready.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.560
- Go?
- Go.

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.160
240 joules.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.080
Charged.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.560
Good, okay now. It's alright now.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.840
Pulse and BP back to normal.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:48.680
Give her fluids.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.680
Check on her every half hour.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.080
Let me know immediately
if there is a problem.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:52.720
OK.

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:54.160
Dr. Liang.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.320
Sign here, please.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.560
Here's your pen.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.280
Dr. Liang...

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.320
Give me one!

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.400
Are you alright Dr. Liang?

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.560
You didn't feel anything?

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.720
You didn't even know about the... zapping?

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.320
Do you know how scary it was?

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.000
The nurse said,
Dr. Liang's hands were shaking

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.920
like he was a first time intern.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.520
Did they take off my clothes?

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.160
Who was it that did it?

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:33.320
That means Dr. Liang saw me naked.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.680
Honey, what are you thinking?

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:36.200
You almost died.

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.400
I heard that,

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:52.280
when you were trying to save me,

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.400
you lost it a little bit.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:57.760
Why are you smiling?

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.920
Do I have something on my teeth?

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.000
Your wig is crooked.

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.720
Is it good now?

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.400
You don't think it's a hassle?

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.160
No one minds what you look like here.

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.480
It keeps me warm.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.080
Do you have time now?

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:22.840
It probably has fleas.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.200
So what, I have tumors.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.280
Have you ever had any pets?

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.520
I don't even have enough time
to take care of myself,

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.640
how would I have time to take care of pets?

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.400
When I was 3 years old,

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.120
my dad brought a puppy home.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:43.760
I called him Huan.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.480
He grew up with me.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.560
He walked me to school every day.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.120
And when school got out,

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.000
he'd be right there,
waiting for me at the gate.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.720
One day, my dad and I
brought him out for a walk,

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.440
we were walking in the front,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.440
Huan followed us.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.600
We had just crossed an intersection when,

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.040
I heard a screeching sound from a car's breaks.

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.920
Right when I was about to turn my head,

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.320
my dad took my head into his arms.

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:12.720
He covered my eyes.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.680
I never had a chance

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:17.920
to see what had happened to Huan.

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.640
[Dr. Liang please come to
conference room 5 immediately.]

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.680
I've got a meeting.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.080
Here, sanitizer for your hands.

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.000
Let me give you some hand lotion.

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:40.320
No, it's okay.

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:42.480
You wash your hands so many times every day.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.720
You need to protect them.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.680
Take it. It's yours.

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:50.520
I have more.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.440
Well, okay.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.560
Thanks.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:00.680
Am I

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.680
particularly resilient?

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.400
Like an unbeatable little cockroach?

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.440
I need to go.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.320
By looking at his eyes,

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.360
I think...

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.880
I can start knitting again!

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.040
OK. Go and get the paperwork ready,

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.240
and let me know if anything else happens.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:54.600
OK.

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.520
Who were you talking with?

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.600
Your grandma tripped and fell.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.840
Was it bad?

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:08.800
Yeah, she broke her leg.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.640
She's in the hospital now.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.520
You guys should go see her.

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:17.920
It's okay. I've got Lao Zheng

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.280
and Emmy here with me.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.680
Are you sure?

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.360
I do feel like we should go back to see her.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.840
Because of your grandma's situation,

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.080
and her age.

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.640
And her heart isn't so well either.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.120
I'm afraid whether she can handle the surgery.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.280
<i>Sometimes</i>

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.720
<i>I feel like I'm just dead weight.</i>

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.720
<i>Absolutely worthless.</i>

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.160
<i>Dr. Liang,</i>

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.280
<i>there you are.</i>

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:02.840
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.240
<i>Your office.</i>

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.240
<i>There has always been a delicate</i>

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.040
<i>relationship between doctors
and their patients.</i>

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.360
<i>Patients depend on their doctors.</i>

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.080
<i>Also,</i>

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.040
<i>when you care for your patients</i>

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:14.080
<i>on every aspect.</i>

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.840
<i>It's often easy to develop feelings.</i>

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:17.560
<i>They're just rumors.</i>

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.360
It's all exaggerated.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.520
I don't think we should worry about it.

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:23.040
I understand,

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:23.880
and I trust your

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.280
judgments.

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.760
I just wanted to remind you that's all.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:28.440
But,

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.640
on the other hand,

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.040
it's about time you start thinking
about your life.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.160
You can't be single forever.

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.760
Xiong Dun,

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.000
that girl is pretty sweet.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.120
If she wasn't sick,

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.800
maybe there's a chance...

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.600
You guys seem like you'd suit each other.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.480
Please director, stop joking around.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.440
She's my patient, nothing more.

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:51.920
Hello.

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.120
OK. l got it!

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.000
The report for patient in bed 6 is out.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.120
- Let's go.
- OK.

01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:57.680
Let's go!

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:02.600
That's enough, come on...

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:03.360
How many have you eaten already?

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.200
Take it easy with the dumplings.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:06.320
Why didn't you bring some vinegar?

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.120
Don't be so picky.

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:07.800
Just enjoy it.

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:08.640
What took you so long?

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.120
Let me tell you, my mom's dumplings
are ridiculously good.

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:10.840
Come on.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.600
Professor Liang,

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.240
clinically speaking,

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:29.640
when leukocytes are lower then 3.0,

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.840
or neutrophils are lower then 1.5,

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.160
what should we do?

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.320
That's not hard actually.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.560
After the leukocyte injection,

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.720
the majority of patients' leukocytes

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.880
will return to the normal on the second day.

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.760
The answers for those questions
are in the textbook.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.480
I suggest everyone to ask some questions about

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.840
patients' psychological problems.

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:52.640
I have a non Hodgkin's lymphoma patient.

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:54.160
Her name, is Xiong Dun.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.160
I have never treated anyone
who was so positive,

01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.080
and so upbeat about her situation.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.040
During our contact,

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.880
I've noticed a few really
interesting personality traits...

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.480
first of all...

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.440
All right, stop taking it apart.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.320
Time to go home.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.520
Give it to me. Give it.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.680
Congrats, Xiong Dun!

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.280
Even though,

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.400
your evaluation has cleared you for release,

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:28.520
you should take the medicine on time

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.640
and come back for examinations regularly.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.760
Are you here as a friend saying goodbye,

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:35.200
or as a doctor checking on his patient?

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:39.720
Dr. Liang,

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:40.880
please sign for the prescription.

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:41.680
Okay.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:56.840
Take care.

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.640
Don't ever come back.

01:26:58.640 --> 01:26:59.640
And don't come back to visit me either!

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.320
Yes, your highness.

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:05.920
You must pay attention to these.

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:06.600
Sure.

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:09.880
Emmy's company is going to send her
to Japan for a while.

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.320
She is leaving tomorrow morning.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.200
But she has to work tonight.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.680
She said not to wait up for her.

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.480
Tomorrow morning,

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:17.160
she'll go to your room to say goodbye.

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.760
Let's go to Emmy's company.

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:27.920
What is everybody doing?

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.120
How many times must
you make the same mistakes?

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.000
You really can't go in there.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.720
If it happens again, you're all fired!

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:34.680
Got it?

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:42.720
Yes.

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:43.680
A little.

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:44.520
Good.

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.640
You asshole!

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:46.680
What?

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:52.480
One of your employees, Emmy, is my roommate.

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:53.920
Out of all the months this year,
I have not seen her

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.680
for at least 3 months of that time.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.760
When she's off work, I'm already asleep.

01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.720
And when I wake up in the morning,
she's already gone.

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:01.360
Forget about relationship, marriage, and kids.

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.640
She even has to pick what dates
she's allowed to get sick.

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.840
She's moving to Japan tomorrow,

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.240
and you're still keeping her here tonight,

01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.600
for overtime?

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.680
Does this company have
any compassion for human beings?

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.280
Stop using your Japanese

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.120
workaholic spirit and crap to fool us.

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.040
We've only got one life to life,

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:17.920
even if she were to work her ass off,

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.000
it shouldn't be for someone

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.600
as shameful and horrible as you.

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:21.840
You don't deserve her!

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:26.280
What you think you're
all better now that you're out?

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.880
Why did you come here?

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:28.560
That little stunt you pulled in there...

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.320
sure it was fun for you,

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.880
but what will happen to me after this?

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:33.160
Why are you not saying anything?

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.240
You being better now doesn't mean
you're better than everyone!

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:40.600
Lao Zheng, let's go!

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.600
Xiong Dun!

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.240
If you're made because I didn't tell you

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.000
about going to Japan...

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.240
Stop saying what you think I feel.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.000
Okay.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:47.640
Then tell me.

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.040
I've got nothing to say.

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:50.040
I'm a bitch.

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.800
I shouldn't have interfered with your life.

01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:54.600
Just how meaningless do you think my life is?

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:56.400
I don't need you to run out from the hospital
the second you're better

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.480
so you can come and save me!

01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.240
I'm allowed to choose how I live.

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.520
What's wrong with that?

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.080
What did you choose?

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:03.480
Relationship wise, you're someone's mistress.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.040
And work wise, you're nothing but a slave.

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:08.720
You think you're the only one
that understands love?

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.840
You think only your love is the real deal?

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:11.400
Seducing your doctor in a hospital,

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.680
how's that any more noble?

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:14.520
If you asked me, I think you're just laughable.

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:22.560
Emmy.

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:23.440
Go way!

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.720
Good for your recovery,
now get the hell out!

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.760
All of you, get out!

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:10.400
Mom,

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.280
I want to go home.

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:05.320
[29 years old]

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.560
[Welcome home, Xiong!]

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.160
What the heck?

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.480
Welcome!

01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:20.800
The warmest welcome!

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.080
Welcome!

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:47.920
[Inbox - Xiong Dun]

01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:00.440
[I'd rather be dumped ten times
but not by you once.]

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.400
[Your life is mine, don't screw it.]

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.480
It's you again.

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.160
Am I dreaming?

01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.520
Yes.

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.440
I wanted to say the same thing too.

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.040
It's you again.

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:04.840
You know if you wanted to see me,

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.160
you could've just called.

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.720
You didn't have to come all this way.

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:12.160
Are you happy

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:13.280
to see me again?

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:16.160
No.

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.680
I knew it.

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:21.320
But I'm happy to see you.

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.560
Let us be

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:26.400
like before,

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.520
like I told you.

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:29.680
I'm responsible for treating you,

01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:32.120
and you are responsible for believing in me,

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:33.520
alright?

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.120
Looks like it's my only option.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:47.280
Stamp.

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:50.800
All right.

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.560
Get some rest.

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:53.640
OK.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.160
Have you been here long?

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:08.800
No.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.200
Does it still hurt?

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.760
The injections make me nauseous.

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.480
But after I took the antiemetic
pills for the nausea,

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:22.240
then I get constipated.

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.520
Then, if I took the pills for constipation,

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:25.720
then my head starts hurting.

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:28.720
So, do you think I should
lake the pills for my headache?

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:30.840
That's bad...

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:33.000
and you're still being silly and telling jokes.

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.000
I think it's better to
die happy than sad right?

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.280
Can you hand me that?

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:47.840
The blue one.

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:48.600
- This?
- Yep.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:53.640
It's for you.

01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:58.560
What is it?

01:37:58.920 --> 01:37:59.640
You're...

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.800
not asking me to knit you a scarf are you?

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.680
It's for your future girlfriend.

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:09.000
Ask her to knit something for you.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.480
If she knows how to, that is.

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.640
It's okay if she doesn't,
just don't throw it away.

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.560
It was pretty expensive.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.880
It's very warm.

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:16.800
Then why don't you

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.320
keep it for yourself?

01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.160
I've been knitting for a long time now,

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:24.640
but nothing ever came out of it.

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:26.240
I don't want to knit anymore.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.440
I won't take no for answer!

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:31.520
OK.

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:32.920
Thank you.

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:39.840
I've always wanted to ask you a question.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.120
If...

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:46.120
If I was your girlfriend,

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:49.400
would you feel embarrassed?

01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:58.160
Let me put it this way.

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:02.200
You are a surprise,

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.680
one that I'd only see once

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.440
in a lifetime.

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.240
Just like

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:13.800
an angel

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.560
sent from the heavens.

01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:18.520
You have left

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:19.920
a seed of happiness

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.800
in my heart.

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.040
And now,

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:26.600
it has begun to sprout.

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:33.400
Am I that powerful?

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:34.520
Yes.

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:37.120
You must be saying all this,

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.680
because I'm about to die.

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:42.280
You are not me.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.040
So you wouldn't understand
what you mean to me.

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.840
Do you still remember the story of Huan?

01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:58.720
Of course.

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:00.560
He was your dog.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:01.680
Yes.

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.640
I didn't finish the story.

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:08.040
I thought... he died.

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:08.720
Yeah.

01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.880
And after Huan died.

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:14.480
I was sad for a really long time.

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.400
A year after,

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.640
my dad found another dog for me.

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.640
In the beginning, I was really happy.

01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:24.720
But after I had him for a week,

01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:26.040
I told my dad

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.840
that I didn't want to keep him anymore.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:31.880
Because when I thought that
he'd die one day too,

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:34.720
that I have to experience
the pain all over again.

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:36.720
I was scared.

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.120
But my father told me,

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.000
we shouldn't be scared to live

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.680
just because

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:45.160
we're going to die some day.

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.320
Death,

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:48.920
is only a result.

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:50.760
How we live,

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.400
is the most important part...

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.280
To have experienced life,

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:57.320
loved,

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.680
fought through difficulties,

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.640
and overcame ourselves.

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:04.600
It's only when we have experienced all these,

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:07.120
can we really know what life means.

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.640
Therefore,

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:12.200
we can't give up

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.520
just because we are afraid of losing.

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:16.360
Right?

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:24.560
As for me,

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.040
it's simply too late.

01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:28.880
Otherwise...

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.120
You know?

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:36.720
What do I know?

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:38.200
Stop it,

01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.680
don't make me say it.

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:42.400
I know,

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:43.480
I know.

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:05.760
<i>This victory,</i>

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:07.720
<i>is for my friend Xiong Dun.</i>

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.360
<i>I want to thank her.</i>

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:10.240
<i>If it wasn't for her,</i>

01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:12.240
<i>I wouldn't be standing here today.</i>

01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.920
<i>She is the one who told me,</i>

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.320
<i>we must have dreams,</i>

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.200
<i>what if they came true one day?</i>

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:20.000
<i>Xiong Dun.</i>

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.320
<i>That's when I realized,</i>

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:23.720
<i>I may be great at consoling other people,</i>

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.520
<i>but there are a lot of things
that I wanted to do...</i>

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:28.240
<i>that had only been thoughts so far.</i>

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:31.360
<i>When it comes time to really
check things off my life,</i>

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:34.760
<i>I've found out that it's never too late.</i>

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.560
<i>Standing in front of all my dreams,</i>

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:39.200
<i>everything can be excuses.</i>

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:41.760
Is this what you want to do?

01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:45.560
No.

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.120
This is only the beginning.

01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:52.360
Go to a rock concert,

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.560
and rock out alongside your ears!

01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.280
Drink a round of shots,

01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:00.720
and scare alcoholics out of their shirts!

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.520
Host a cosplay party!

01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.240
Hooray for the two dimensional world!

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:05.360
Pet a big reptile.

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:07.280
And become one courageous bear.

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.760
Eat 5 pounds of rice cakes.

01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.240
Roll, stomach, roll!

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:11.520
Fly down the road on a motorcycle,

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:13.560
and feel the speed racing through my veins!

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:14.840
Meet a Weibo star,

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:16.640
and experience Prince Ma Boyong's kindness.

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:18.040
Learn to play an instrument,

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.240
and play it for a crush.

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:20.600
Plant an epiphyllum,

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:22.000
and wait for it to bloom.

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:24.040
Cook a delicious meal for my parents,

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.520
even if it doesn't look delicious,

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:26.520
or taste... delicious.

01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:28.000
Go on a night fishing trip,

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.920
absorb the moon's serene energy.

01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:31.880
Stare up at the Kanas sky,

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:33.600
and find my constellation.

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.520
Bath under the Mohe's aurora,

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:37.000
and feel its magical mysteriousness.

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.000
Watch the sun rise at the top of the world,

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:56.040
and shout:

01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:57.440
GO AWAY!

01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:00.160
MR. TUMOR!

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:38.800
I've always liked touching your lips,
ever since I was little.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:40.920
Otherwise I couldn't fall asleep.

01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:46.040
You were so dependent when you were a child.

01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:51.040
I have been thinking a lot

01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:53.520
about your childhood these days.

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:56.200
I still feel like

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.800
you were a kid just yesterday.

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:00.880
And a day later,

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:04.720
you have already grown up.

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:15.320
I remember one time I had
a fever and felt miserable.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.440
But whenever I laid down next to you,

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:20.040
everything would feel better.

01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:25.200
It was so weird.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.560
It still is.

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:33.240
Tell me if you don't feel well.

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.360
Don't keep it to yourself.

01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:39.040
Okay.

01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:50.720
Mom,

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:02.680
do you know my bank password?

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:07.600
I don't want to know.

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:10.760
It's your birthday.

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:19.640
It's the same for all of my cards.

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.160
I'm afraid I might forget.

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:29.080
Let Lao Zheng deal with the rest.

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:34.560
Mom,

01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:40.880
I know how hard this must be for you.

01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:45.800
It's pretty tough for me too.

01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.400
Mom, I'm sorry.

01:46:58.640 --> 01:46:59.800
In the next life...

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:01.280
Mom.

01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:04.240
Let's still be family in the next life.

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.560
Mom.

01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:12.880
It won't ever hurt again.

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:02.200
[Xiong, we miss you]

01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:03.160
Hi everyone.

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.520
Even though I'm standing up here,

01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:06.480
however,

01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.680
I will not be hosting this funeral today.

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:11.240
According to Xiong Dun's will,

01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:12.440
she will be

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:13.840
hosting her own.

01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:19.280
Hello everybody!

01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:20.200
Isn't it a huge surprise

01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:21.840
to see me here?

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:24.160
Unfortunately, I can't see your expressions.

01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:26.160
It feels a little strange.

01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:27.920
For my funeral,

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:29.720
I don't want sad music,

01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:30.480
no paper flowers.

01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:31.440
I want fresh flowers.

01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:32.480
No tears.

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.600
Forget it.

01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:43.720
This is the fifth time already.

01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:46.920
Because I really don't know how to start.

01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.400
Whenever I think

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.880
that all of you will see me again
at my funeral...

01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:53.440
it just feels a little spooky.

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:55.160
It really makes me wanna laugh.

01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:58.880
Sorry! Everyone.

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:00.280
I couldn't make it.

01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:05.360
But when I think about it...

01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:06.800
From now on, until... forever,

01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:08.720
I'll always be 30 in your hearts.

01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:32.440
When we finally get to meet in heaven,

01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:34.760
I would look the youngest!

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:35.800
That makes me

01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:37.480
quite satisfied.

01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:39.920
There's a proverb that describes
the voice and expression

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:41.880
of the deceased... I think I fit that
pretty well right about now.

01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:46.520
Thank you, Mom and Dad.

01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:49.000
Thank you,

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:52.520
Lao Zheng, Ai Mi, Xiao Xia,

01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:54.400
and all of my friends,

01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:56.400
who have accompanied me

01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:58.120
through my final days.

01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:00.160
l am the only one,

01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:01.240
amongst all of you,

01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:04.160
that's had experiences dealing with Mr. Death.

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.160
So from now on,

01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:07.280
I have the authority to direct your lives now.

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:11.040
My train has arrived at its terminal station.

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.880
But yours have not.

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:14.680
You must live happily,

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:15.600
and spectacularly,

01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:17.040
and live out the rest of your days.

01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:18.840
Remember,

01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:20.840
to love and to be loved,

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:23.200
are the most important
and wonderful things in the world.

01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:25.920
So, don't ever give up.

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:28.480
I've never really left you guys.

01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:30.280
This is just another, a different way

01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:32.560
to continue living in
your lives and your hearts.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:34.920
Finally,

01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:39.840
whenever you encounter difficulties
you can't overcome,

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:41.080
repeat my name

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:41.640
silently,

01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:42.720
in your hearts,

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:43.680
for three times!

01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:46.800
And I will bestow power to you from up above.

01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:53.880
My name is Xiong Dun.

01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:54.800
Xiong, like a bear.

01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:55.680
and Dun, like Newton.

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:07.760
