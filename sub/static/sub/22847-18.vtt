00:01.210 --> 00:03.379
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.546 --> 00:05.965
Hale maybe after a weapon
powered by gravitonium.

00:06.132 --> 00:07.341
No gizmo, no apocalypse.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.301
You're my one weakness, Mum.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.636
And I'm yours.

00:14.056 --> 00:17.018
I was using my speed and it felt like
my arms were being ripped off.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.853
The mech arms aren't built to go
that fast.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.856
<i>You find a way out, make it
to the Quinjet, call for backup.</i>

00:24.650 --> 00:27.069
Looks like you two have made
quite the mess.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.238
<i>They destroyed a component
for the infuser.</i>

00:29.447 --> 00:32.575
We can't transfer the gravitonium
until it's repaired.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.326
Fix it or bleed out.

00:34.577 --> 00:36.829
- We can't let it happen again.
- We don't have a choice.

00:36.996 --> 00:39.874
<i>Glenn, the doctor said
that you should take a deep breath.</i>

00:40.041 --> 00:42.793
- Are you ready to comply?
- I'm happy to.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.725
Complete the mission, soldier.

00:59.852 --> 01:00.853
Eyes on the prize.

01:27.546 --> 01:28.547
Be prepared.

01:29.757 --> 01:30.966
Nobody has to get hurt.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.654
Get in...

01:52.321 --> 01:53.447
get out.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.510
Complete the mission.

02:20.182 --> 02:21.267
- Hey, Talbot.
- Hey!

02:22.560 --> 02:23.978
- You looking for something?
- Huh.

02:24.854 --> 02:25.855
Just like a...

02:26.981 --> 02:30.109
ticking time bomb over here, I'm...
I'm sorry. Just, I've been...

02:31.610 --> 02:34.697
in a cell for six months.
You know I'm just a little pent up.

02:34.864 --> 02:35.865
Can't sit still.

02:37.533 --> 02:38.534
I can't imagine.

02:39.869 --> 02:42.872
- I wish we got you out sooner.
- Me too, son.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.499
Me too.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.753
Hey, listen, if you ever wanna talk
about it or anything else...

02:50.045 --> 02:52.756
I can't. No, I can't do that.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.136
But... But thanks.
You know, just tryin' to focus on one...

02:59.638 --> 03:01.765
- task at a time.
- Right.

03:01.849 --> 03:02.766
Hm.

03:03.434 --> 03:06.687
Yeah. Well... rest up. Doctor's orders.

03:07.563 --> 03:09.481
Yeah. You got it.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.986
Happy to comply.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.006
Stop!

03:35.299 --> 03:36.383
Aw!

03:37.259 --> 03:38.844
But I'm enjoying myself.

03:40.137 --> 03:43.724
I don't really get out much
and it does seem to keep you motivated.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.065
Okay. Let her go.

03:51.357 --> 03:53.067
You want this machine fixed,
I need her help.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.987
Please. I'm engineering, she's bio-tech.

03:58.781 --> 03:59.782
We're a team.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.130
Hey.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.466
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.052
- Sure?
- I'm all right, Fitz.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.179
Okay.

04:25.474 --> 04:26.809
You two are adorable.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.062
I ship it, I really do.

04:30.396 --> 04:33.274
Do you have any idea of the consequences
of what you're trying to do?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.942
We've seen where this leads.

04:36.235 --> 04:39.655
Your little trip to the future?
Coulson filled me in.

04:39.822 --> 04:43.617
Then you'll know that you'll destroy
everything. The entire planet.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.829
See, I thought your pal Daisy
did all of that.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.456
You people really need
to get your stories straight.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.625
Everyone that you care about will die.

04:52.293 --> 04:55.087
- Not a long list.
- And it's getting shorter.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.757
Found Anton, what's left of him.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.929
He took a header out a window.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.015
Then someone else must be here.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.976
Not for long. I activated
our copter's signal jammer

05:09.184 --> 05:11.228
and set the fallen mechs
to seek and destroy.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.772
- You know how to reprogram them?
- I took one apart once.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.691
It's basic protocol, but effective.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.359
They'll hunt down and kill
anyone they find.

05:23.699 --> 05:24.700
Show me.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.846
You realise that we have a choice
to make?

05:46.055 --> 05:48.682
Yeah. Our hypothesis is being proven.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.644
We die, we break the loop.
We don't fix this, we stop them.

05:53.812 --> 05:54.813
They'll kill us.

05:55.773 --> 05:57.274
I can't choose anything over you,

05:57.441 --> 05:58.650
- not even...
- I feel the same way.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.028
So?

06:04.281 --> 06:06.658
So, we keep working. Piece by piece.

06:07.951 --> 06:08.952
There's a lot to do.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.330
Yeah.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.541
- Very complicated. It will take a while.
- Hey!

06:16.085 --> 06:18.879
Pick up the pace...
or I start removing body parts...

06:20.255 --> 06:21.382
like I did to your friend.

07:15.853 --> 07:18.230
- You're late.
- Hold up. Please.

07:20.732 --> 07:23.277
We didn't have a chance
to finish our conversation.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.237
I said what I had to say.

07:29.158 --> 07:30.576
- Melin...
- We have a mission, Phil.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.372
Good talk, Phil. Good talk.

07:39.460 --> 07:43.422
Okay, the mechs went into a system reset
and sent a distress signal out.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.841
We traced it to a location
in the Appalachian Mountains

07:46.008 --> 07:49.178
and after some satellite imaging,
we can confirm that this is Hale's base.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.971
It's a decommissioned
military bunker.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.307
Which means, it's highly secure
and way off the grid.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.350
We'll need to hit them hard and fast.
Knock out their defences

07:55.517 --> 07:57.936
- before they even know we're there.
- Lighthouse rules.

07:58.604 --> 08:01.106
Club 'em from behind, you don't
stop swinging until they stay down.

08:03.442 --> 08:05.444
- What?
- You wearing body spray?

08:05.611 --> 08:08.489
May and I go in, we get the gravitonium,
get the queen off the board.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.449
Checkmate. When do we leave?

08:10.657 --> 08:12.409
- You're not coming.
- I'm not?

08:14.161 --> 08:17.539
We just got you back and I need you
to stay here and quarterback.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.125
Mack, find Fitz's schematics
and start building

08:20.292 --> 08:21.960
the artificial gravity system
for <i>Zephyr One.</i>

08:22.211 --> 08:24.171
Oh, please don't tell me we're going back
to space.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.840
- Not until we have to.
- May I...

08:27.382 --> 08:29.134
You need me to back you up or...

08:29.885 --> 08:32.221
You literally just got shot.
Why are you out of bed?

08:33.972 --> 08:34.972
I've handled worse.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.351
No. You stay here and help Mack.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.269
All right, yeah,
if that's how you wanna play it.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.063
- Awesome.
- Okay, <i>Z-One's</i> wheels up in five.

08:42.231 --> 08:44.483
- Let's go.
- All right, people, you heard her.

08:44.775 --> 08:45.776
Let's get to work.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.992
Getting good at this. You are.

08:54.743 --> 08:58.372
I have a feeling Professor Coulson
was easy on his students.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.458
I should at least lose points
for the mutiny on day one.

09:01.792 --> 09:02.793
For sure.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.921
But I'm throwing you some extra credit
for a well-timed rescue.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.841
- Give 'em hell.
- Yes, sir.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.646
What took you so long?

09:22.813 --> 09:24.606
- It's Ruby, she's...
- Gone rogue. I know.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.233
She's headed for the chamber facility.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.777
- Get me Anton on the line.
- I can't, ma'am. He's dead.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.573
I called in reinforcements here
because his mechs went down.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.075
We picked these up
right before they went offline.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.078
We need
to leave immediately.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.747
Ruby's dead set on powering herself
with gravitonium.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.541
You saw what it did to Creel.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.626
He's not better, is he?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.838
No, ma'am. He's much worse.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.389
Mr Creel,
how can we help you?

09:57.598 --> 09:58.599
You can't.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.769
No one can. They won't stop shouting.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.732
- Voices, he says.
- They hate each other.

10:07.608 --> 10:08.817
- Quinn likes to feel...
- To feel smart.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.444
- ...but Hall's smarter.
- Tell me, what you're doing?

10:10.569 --> 10:12.613
- No!
- But Quinn's louder.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.156
Quinn?

10:15.741 --> 10:17.492
- Ian Quinn?
- It consumed him.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.496
Franklin wanted revenge,
but now he's stuck with him. Forever.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.583
They're inside the gravitonium?

10:25.542 --> 10:28.170
Their minds, their rage...

10:29.838 --> 10:32.049
Ma'am. He only touched it for a moment.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.843
- If Ruby infuses herself...
- To hell with her!

10:35.135 --> 10:36.678
- What about me?
- General?

10:39.389 --> 10:40.390
They want out.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.773
They want out! Get them out!

10:50.233 --> 10:51.234
Get 'em out!

11:03.872 --> 11:05.040
You makin' some progress?

11:07.751 --> 11:09.586
Yeah, it's coming along. But I gotta say,

11:09.878 --> 11:13.215
the idea of the <i>Zephyr</i> flying to space
still feels a bit out there.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.300
Yeah, well, I'm not even gonna be born
for another 50 years,

11:15.467 --> 11:16.635
so maybe rethink "out there".

11:16.718 --> 11:18.470
Well, let's hope
it never happens, but...

11:19.054 --> 11:21.765
- if we can't change things, there's...
- Always be prepared. Yeah, yeah.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.308
You guys need to relax.

11:23.809 --> 11:25.852
Daisy is gonna figure all this stuff out.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.818
- What was that?
- The dude's got it bad.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.153
Whatever that means.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.031
- You're in love with her.
- Sorry?

11:39.116 --> 11:41.868
Wha... No. No offense, Mack,

11:42.035 --> 11:45.205
but I think your radar is way misfiring
on this one.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.708
- That was convincing. I believe him.
- Thank you.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.293
You confessed, you idiot.
When you were hopped up on painkillers.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.170
Piper and I couldn't get you to shut up
about it.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.005
No. That's...

11:54.381 --> 11:58.093
Okay, guys, what, you've never heard
that drugs can make you say stuff

11:58.301 --> 12:00.429
that's a little crazy?
Maybe that's why drugs are bad.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.806
It's obvious.
I figured it out a while ago.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.019
All right, well, it doesn't matter,
she hates me anyway.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.397
- Most definitely.
- Yeah.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.065
Just for grins,

12:12.983 --> 12:17.863
say I were interested in someone, anyone,
how would I...

12:20.282 --> 12:22.492
- Like, you've got a good thing going.
- Don't look at me.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.871
Last time I saw Yo-Yo, she lied to me,
locked me up and ran off.

12:26.538 --> 12:27.998
- Coulson?
- Sorry, bro.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.417
Apparently,
I'm incapable of expressing my feelings

12:30.625 --> 12:32.043
or letting people take care of me.

12:33.503 --> 12:34.546
You guys are useless.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.340
It's lemons, then.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.343
Come again?

12:42.012 --> 12:45.265
In my day, when you wanted
to tell someone how you felt,

12:45.515 --> 12:48.268
you just save up your tokens, you buy
a lemon, you leave it on their bunk.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.937
'Cause that's...
that's a thing here, right?

12:54.065 --> 12:55.233
- Hundred percent.
- Yeah, absolutely.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.444
- When in doubt, get a bunch of lemons.
- You should do that. Yeah.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.244
Let me in, let me in. Anybody home?

13:14.377 --> 13:15.378
Ring-a-ding-ding.

13:21.343 --> 13:23.303
We're gonna need every weapon
in this fight.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.224
We better hurry. We gotta be ready.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.029
It feels good going on offense
for a change. You and me.

13:43.615 --> 13:44.783
If I need one, I'll take one.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.410
I've got some pent-up aggression
I need to let out.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.413
- You want to talk about it?
- No. I want to hit.

13:52.457 --> 13:56.002
- Agent Johnson, system check is complete.
- Go hot, wait for my signal.

14:02.008 --> 14:05.637
Thomas, initiate launch countdown.
Try not to hit us on the way down.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.430
Copy that. Ten seconds.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.810
- Safety first.
- Always.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.148
Game on.

14:48.930 --> 14:49.931
What was that?

15:46.112 --> 15:47.113
Stop!

15:48.865 --> 15:49.866
Stand down.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.327
- Ma'am, what are you...
- That's an order.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.380
I surrender.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.383
And we totally believe you.

16:06.675 --> 16:09.219
There's no time for us
to fight each other. I need your help.

16:09.594 --> 16:13.264
- We all have to leave. Right now.
- Help you? You can't be serious.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.519
My daughter took the gravitonium
and went to use Strucker's machine.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.105
The Destroyer of Worlds.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.526
She's at the same facility
your scientist friends are.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.486
Last I knew, they were alive.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.490
But if Ruby succeeds, you make no mistake,
she will kill them.

16:38.123 --> 16:40.333
No! Hey! Hey! Wait!

16:42.460 --> 16:45.338
Since you were taking a while.
Is this above your grade level?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.424
No, no, no.
They're S.H.I.E.L.D.'s best and brightest.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.844
There's nothing they can't do,
if motivated.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.514
Torturing us isn't going to make us work
any faster.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.517
Well, you didn't seem to mind torture
the last time we met.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.227
Electrocuting me?

16:59.644 --> 17:02.814
You two didn't have wedding rings
then either.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.607
Please, we're doing what you asked.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.569
- Move, move.
- Okay.

17:14.075 --> 17:17.037
The infuser's reversed,
they're gonna have to start over.

17:17.912 --> 17:20.582
You know, I only really need one of you.
Two is starting to feel redundant.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.584
Hey! We're working
with very limited resources

17:22.751 --> 17:23.917
on a very old machine.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.588
Fitz!

17:27.172 --> 17:28.173
- No.
- No.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.264
Stop it! Leave him alone! We'll fix it!
We'll fix it!

17:44.314 --> 17:46.107
Hey! Eyes up.

17:47.776 --> 17:48.777
Look at me.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.783
Next time, it's her.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.494
And I won't use my fists.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.773
This kid likes her crimson crayon. Redrum.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.150
Redrum.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.154
What is this?

18:35.824 --> 18:36.825
Busted.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.372
Hi. My name's Glenn Talbot.

18:44.332 --> 18:45.416
You helped rescue me.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.669
What are you doing in our room?

18:48.169 --> 18:50.171
Uh. Right. Uh...

18:50.922 --> 18:53.591
I shouldn't... I shouldn't be here.
You're right, I know better.

18:54.259 --> 18:57.470
I just... I... I just... I couldn't...
I couldn't help myself.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.726
I have a boy, George.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.146
He likes to draw, too.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.982
I just haven't seen him in a long time.

19:11.234 --> 19:12.235
This is hard.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.702
I'm sorry. I just...

19:22.620 --> 19:23.746
I haven't been myself.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.960
I think we're all a bit out of sorts
these days.

19:30.753 --> 19:31.754
It's a strange time.

19:33.590 --> 19:37.760
So, this is who all the fuss is about?
She can tell the future?

19:39.012 --> 19:40.013
Sort of.

19:41.639 --> 19:44.517
She sees a lot, but it's all out of order.

19:47.979 --> 19:52.192
That's a pretty remarkable gift you have,
young lady.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.945
You must've seen some incredible things.

19:58.740 --> 19:59.741
Now, now.

20:01.159 --> 20:04.245
There's no need to be afraid of me.
I'm Glenn.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.082
You're the general.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.836
That's right. How did you know that?

20:13.922 --> 20:14.923
I've drawn you.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.969
There's something wrong with him.
Creel touched the gravitonium

20:20.136 --> 20:22.096
and felt people in there.

20:22.305 --> 20:23.932
<i>- Franklin Hall.</i>
- Ian Quinn, too.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.350
We've seen it consume people,

20:25.516 --> 20:28.061
but apparently, it also absorbs
their consciousness.

20:28.478 --> 20:29.604
<i>Is that even possible?</i>

20:29.771 --> 20:32.065
<i>Well, assume the answer to that question
is always, "Yes".</i>

20:32.148 --> 20:34.484
<i>- How's Creel doing now?</i>
- He's barely hanging on.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.861
Lost in his own head.
We had to sedate him.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.197
<i>We have to get him help.
I owe him that much.</i>

20:39.364 --> 20:41.407
And we will, but right now we have
to stop Ruby.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.994
According to Hale, Fitz and Simmons
have been spotted on site.

20:45.203 --> 20:46.204
Damn it, Yo-Yo.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.165
If that crazy Hydra girl powers herself...

20:49.415 --> 20:51.042
Daisy, you can't go there.
That's too dangerous.

20:51.209 --> 20:53.253
<i>For the hundredth time,
I'm not gonna quake the world apart.</i>

20:53.378 --> 20:55.171
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying you have to be careful.

20:55.338 --> 20:58.049
<i>No matter what, I'm not gonna use
my powers around the gravitonium.</i>

20:58.967 --> 21:01.344
If you won't quake and Ruby's powered,
she'll kill you.

21:01.511 --> 21:04.931
<i>Sir, you brought me back to lead.
This is what that looks like.</i>

21:05.265 --> 21:06.599
You can't put yourself at risk like that.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.768
<i>We'll make those decisions, Phil. Not you.</i>

21:10.144 --> 21:11.896
<i>Look, we need every advantage we can get.</i>

21:12.105 --> 21:14.941
<i>So, go through Robin's drawings
and see if there's anything we can use.</i>

21:19.529 --> 21:20.530
Women, huh?

21:22.407 --> 21:23.700
Shut up, lemons.

21:25.618 --> 21:26.619
Who is this?

21:28.121 --> 21:29.247
And when does this happen?

21:29.706 --> 21:32.500
- That's not really how it works.
- Soon.

21:33.835 --> 21:34.836
Soon.

21:36.462 --> 21:40.717
And these? These all come true?
We need to act on this.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.177
There are people who wanna meet you.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.722
- There are people who wanna meet you.
- Robin's getting tired.

21:45.972 --> 21:49.100
- Maybe we could chat about this tomorrow?
- No, tomorrow... Tomorrow's too late.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.353
The mission is... The mission is today.
The mission is now.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.066
I'm really sorry about this.

22:05.616 --> 22:08.703
Go! Robin! No! Robin, get out of here.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.794
- Go! Get help, Robi...
- Just go to sleep.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.798
Shh! That's it.

22:20.923 --> 22:24.302
Shh! Just go to sleep! Shh! Go to sleep.

22:33.770 --> 22:34.937
You're coming with me.

22:37.231 --> 22:38.232
I know.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.371
Our scans show a number
of mechs outside the facility.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.164
Take them out, secure the perimeter.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.875
Only Agent May, Hale
and I will be going in,

22:56.084 --> 22:59.879
and if this goes sideways,
be ready to evac. Now gear up.

23:13.935 --> 23:16.979
- Coulson taught you well.
- Just never gave up on me.

23:18.815 --> 23:21.859
- Promise me you won't hurt Ruby.
- Not unless I have to.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.737
It isn't her fault she's the way she is.

23:27.657 --> 23:29.659
She's driven, she's a great fighter.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.911
And with the right guidance,
she could make a really good agent.

23:32.286 --> 23:33.287
S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?

23:34.580 --> 23:35.665
You're not serious?

23:36.040 --> 23:37.625
We're about to need all the help
we can get.

23:40.586 --> 23:41.671
Tell me what I can do.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.802
If we are too late,
you will need to talk her down.

23:48.845 --> 23:51.180
- We can't let things get out of hand.
- Of course.

23:52.014 --> 23:55.476
- I just want Ruby to be okay.
- You ladies about finished?

24:04.861 --> 24:07.113
Hurts? It's okay.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.698
A plane just landed.

24:09.407 --> 24:10.867
- My mother?
- S.H.I.E.L.D.

24:11.659 --> 24:14.579
I sent the mechs to engage.
That'll buy us a little time.

24:16.289 --> 24:17.748
All right, where should I start? An arm?

24:17.999 --> 24:20.710
- Maybe a leg?
- No. Done, done. We're finished, okay?

24:32.221 --> 24:33.598
- It's ready.
- Yes.

24:53.451 --> 24:54.452
What?

24:56.287 --> 24:57.747
Hey, we did as you asked.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.042
- We fixed the chamber.
- But?

25:02.668 --> 25:06.047
In our experience,
gravitonium is not easy to manipulate,

25:06.672 --> 25:09.300
and we can't move it into the machine.

25:11.302 --> 25:14.388
Wait, hold on. That's...
That's out of our control.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.767
Yeah, gravitonium is unpredictable.
There's still so much that we don't know.

25:17.934 --> 25:20.019
Hey, please, please, you can't do this.

25:20.770 --> 25:23.648
I'm done having people tell me
what I can do.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.046
You were saying?

25:49.966 --> 25:51.175
Jemma, did you see that?

25:52.552 --> 25:53.553
That's...

25:54.804 --> 25:55.805
different.

25:58.099 --> 25:59.308
It's not a bird, it's a plane.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.394
Oh, give me a break.
It looks nothing like the <i>Zephyr.</i>

26:01.477 --> 26:04.772
You guys arguing over drawings?
Welcome to my entire childhood.

26:08.776 --> 26:10.444
Look, we're wasting our time.
Why don't we just ask her

26:10.528 --> 26:12.154
what these crayon doodles mean?

26:12.321 --> 26:15.741
You can go down there, but ask Deke.
Robin's a seer, not really a teller.

26:18.661 --> 26:21.539
Hey. What's with Robin's floor.
Is that paused?

26:29.839 --> 26:30.840
Polly...

26:34.135 --> 26:35.469
- She's breathing.
- Where's Robin?

26:35.761 --> 26:39.015
We've been breached. Someone must have
infiltrated the Lighthouse.

26:39.348 --> 26:42.059
- He took her. Talbot took Robin.
- No.

26:43.144 --> 26:45.104
- He wouldn't.
- Earlier. I saw him, he...

26:45.855 --> 26:49.275
He was messing with the feeds
and he mumbled something. He said...

26:50.401 --> 26:51.569
He said he was happy to comply.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.656
Hydra had him for six months.
How could I have missed it?

26:56.866 --> 26:58.701
- We have to find them.
- I'll stay with her.

27:08.586 --> 27:09.587
You did it.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.258
We did it.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.017
- Ruby!
- Get me out!

28:05.351 --> 28:06.977
Ruby! No!

28:09.980 --> 28:11.732
No, Ruby!

28:13.484 --> 28:14.485
Ruby!

28:16.737 --> 28:17.780
Ruby!

28:18.030 --> 28:20.157
What did you do?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.993
- You're killing her!
- No, this isn't us! We tried to warn her!

28:23.160 --> 28:26.080
- You sabotaged the chamber!
- No, it's not the machine!

28:28.457 --> 28:29.709
Shut it down!

28:40.177 --> 28:41.178
Are we too late?

28:42.471 --> 28:43.514
I don't know.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.934
She only took in eight percent
of the gravitonium.

29:18.215 --> 29:21.302
Ruby!

29:21.969 --> 29:23.512
It's okay. Hey! Hey!

29:24.138 --> 29:27.683
- Oh, they're screaming. They're fighting.
- No.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.102
I've got you.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.148
- Help me.
- I'm not going anywhere.

30:02.009 --> 30:03.093
I didn't mean to.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.889
- Oh, God!
- No!

30:07.056 --> 30:09.934
No, no, get it out of me.
Please make them stop.

30:10.893 --> 30:13.854
- Make... Make... Make who stop?
- All of them. Just please,

30:14.104 --> 30:17.066
please put me back in the machine.
Get it out of me!

30:17.316 --> 30:19.068
We can't. It only works one way.

30:20.069 --> 30:22.696
You lie! You always do this!

30:26.450 --> 30:27.451
Please.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.165
- Ruby, put them down.
- Experimentation

30:33.332 --> 30:34.792
- without thought of consequence.
- ...consequence.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.385
It's Mum. Look at me!

30:49.139 --> 30:50.140
Mum.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.102
There's something really wrong.

30:54.144 --> 30:57.398
I know, we're trying to figure it out.
Just stay strong, sweetie.

30:57.857 --> 31:01.193
Don't panic, just try not to panic, okay?
Just...

31:01.360 --> 31:03.487
They can't be here.
I'll get them out past any mechs.

31:03.863 --> 31:05.489
- Come back, I'll need you.
- Okay.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.951
- It's okay.
- No. No!

31:09.326 --> 31:10.661
No!

31:19.211 --> 31:20.212
Talbot, stop.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.423
- Drop it!
- You drop it. Stand down!

31:22.590 --> 31:23.632
Everybody, calm down!

31:24.466 --> 31:25.467
Glenn, look at me.

31:26.302 --> 31:28.846
Why are you trying to get into the hangar?
What're you doing?

31:29.013 --> 31:32.975
A soldier never questions his orders.
A soldier always completes his mission.

31:33.851 --> 31:34.894
This isn't a mission.

31:35.686 --> 31:39.231
This is Hale. She got into your head.
She brainwashed you.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.067
- Robin, it's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
- Don't you talk to her!

31:42.943 --> 31:45.529
The Hydra compliance program goes
all the way back to Whitehall.

31:45.696 --> 31:46.947
You're trying to get in my head!

31:47.156 --> 31:49.658
You're trying to confuse me
with that Hydra jibber-jabber.

31:49.825 --> 31:51.368
You saw what they did to Creel.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.746
How hard you had to work
to break his programming.

31:53.913 --> 31:54.914
What the hell do you know?

31:56.749 --> 31:57.958
I know you're my friend.

31:58.751 --> 32:02.338
- And you'd never kidnap a little girl.
- Kidn... Kidnap? That...

32:02.630 --> 32:05.049
That's a hell of an accusation, Phil.

32:05.925 --> 32:09.637
- I got a job to do.
- She's not much younger than your kid.

32:10.471 --> 32:12.431
Think about your son, Talbot.

32:13.849 --> 32:17.728
Think about it. What if that was George?
You know this is wrong.

32:17.937 --> 32:21.482
- Shut up! You shut your damn face!
- It's not too late to turn back.

32:22.232 --> 32:27.029
No. My compliances will be rewarded.
It must be... It must be rewarded.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.657
Ignore that.
That's the programming talking, not you.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.242
- Fight it. You can beat it.
- I can't...

32:34.286 --> 32:37.373
I can't... I can't complete the mission,
I ca...

32:39.333 --> 32:41.794
- I gotta stop myself.
- That's right.

32:47.758 --> 32:49.510
Then there's only one course of action.

32:55.724 --> 32:58.686
- Honey, just listen to my voice.
- Listen to you! Listen to them!

32:58.936 --> 33:00.020
Listen, listen, listen!

33:04.233 --> 33:06.986
Remember your training.
We'll get through this.

33:07.236 --> 33:11.156
But I can't control it.
It's like I'm being ripped apart.

33:11.782 --> 33:14.159
Ruby. I have been right where you are.

33:14.743 --> 33:18.622
And I know that it seems impossible
right now, but you will overcome this.

33:18.789 --> 33:19.790
- No.
- Believe me.

33:20.582 --> 33:23.460
They're too loud.
They're trying to take over.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.629
Just focus.

33:26.714 --> 33:29.091
- Breathe. Stay calm.
- It's too late.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.635
No. Daisy's right.
She's been through this.

33:31.802 --> 33:35.055
- Daisy, it's always Daisy!
- Try not to lose control, okay?

33:35.222 --> 33:36.598
Your powers will only
get more dangerous.

33:42.062 --> 33:44.523
Everything powerful is dangerous.

33:49.153 --> 33:50.821
- Melinda.
- Your arm.

33:51.447 --> 33:53.157
It's fine. What happened?

33:53.699 --> 33:55.576
- Did someone go in?
- It's being handled.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.995
- We need to get to the <i>Zephyr.</i>
- Handled by whom?

34:02.791 --> 34:03.792
Daisy.

34:08.172 --> 34:09.590
Talbot, stop. Don't do this.

34:10.340 --> 34:13.385
It doesn't matter anyway.
I'm not the same, Phil.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.222
I can't trust my thoughts.

34:19.766 --> 34:20.809
There's no other way.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.728
Robin, come here. Come on. Come on.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.275
Phil.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.529
- Tell George I'm sorry.
- Put the gun down.

34:32.821 --> 34:33.822
I can't!

34:34.531 --> 34:37.701
- Your compliance will be rewarded.
- You're just tryin' to trick me.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.286
- That's the progra...
- What's best is you comply.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.331
- Put the gun down!
- I can't!

34:42.498 --> 34:43.665
Then turn the gun on me.

34:46.502 --> 34:47.585
You will comply.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.589
Turn the gun on me.

35:03.644 --> 35:07.815
You know, for a long time,
you were everything that I wanted.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.527
You were my hero.

35:13.779 --> 35:14.947
And now look at us.

35:16.448 --> 35:17.533
Ruby, let her go.

35:24.748 --> 35:27.084
I'm more than you will ever be.

35:32.089 --> 35:33.841
Ruby, I am not here to fight you.

35:35.509 --> 35:37.511
- You need help.
- I don't want your help!

35:39.346 --> 35:40.639
I wanna crush you.

35:47.146 --> 35:48.147
Ruby, that's enough!

35:50.899 --> 35:53.527
That's enough!

36:08.584 --> 36:13.005
- You listen to her. She is on your side.
- Then why aren't you?

36:14.923 --> 36:19.178
Mum, face it,
I was never good enough for you.

36:19.469 --> 36:23.098
No. All I ever wanted was for you
to reach your true potential.

36:24.391 --> 36:28.353
- I'm sorry. I pushed you too hard.
- Mum.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.273
This was a mistake.

36:32.608 --> 36:33.609
No.

36:35.402 --> 36:37.070
My daughter is not a mistake.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.451
Yo-Yo, get out of here.

36:43.994 --> 36:46.622
- Okay, just breathe.
- That's who took my arms.

36:47.164 --> 36:49.166
No, Ruby.

36:51.335 --> 36:52.419
It's her, isn't it?

36:53.629 --> 36:57.883
- She's the Destroyer?
- Yo-Yo, she's a kid. She is terrified.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.385
No, you look at me, listen to me.

37:00.719 --> 37:04.097
- Stay with me, we'll get through this.
- No, Mum, they're getting louder.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.769
No! I'm losing. Let us out.

37:09.102 --> 37:10.562
We want out, let us out.

37:10.771 --> 37:12.147
I won't be able to resist.

37:12.231 --> 37:13.190
<i>No!</i>

37:13.607 --> 37:16.276
I can make this better! I promise!

37:19.905 --> 37:20.906
Ruby!

37:22.991 --> 37:23.992
What?

37:25.452 --> 37:28.497
- Ruby? Ruby! No!
- No.

37:30.249 --> 37:31.792
Yo-Yo, what did you do?

37:38.924 --> 37:39.883
No.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.512
No. No!

37:47.266 --> 37:48.267
No!

37:52.646 --> 37:53.647
Ruby.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.232
Ruby.

38:45.699 --> 38:46.700
Simmons.

38:50.620 --> 38:51.621
Where's Hale?

38:57.294 --> 38:59.796
- How did she get away?
- And what happened to Ruby?

39:00.297 --> 39:02.924
I had it under control.
She was coming around,

39:03.175 --> 39:05.552
- and then Yo-Yo killed her.
- No.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.478
I just saved the world.

39:41.838 --> 39:42.839
Qovas.

39:46.426 --> 39:49.388
- Qovas!
- Coming here without invitation?

39:50.430 --> 39:53.767
- You are aware of the punishment.
- I found what you're looking for.

39:54.726 --> 39:55.727
My gravitonium.

39:57.354 --> 39:59.981
- S.H.I.E.L.D. has it.
- Then you've failed.

40:00.524 --> 40:04.319
- Perhaps our deal has reached its end.
- I can tell you where they're hiding...

40:05.987 --> 40:07.489
but they won't give it willingly.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.333
You'd have me kill them?

40:22.295 --> 40:24.089
I have no reason to stop you.
