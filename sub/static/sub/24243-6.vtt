00:16.394 --> 00:19.796
It's not bad.

00:22.989 --> 00:26.805
Here I am. Haha!

00:34.600 --> 00:37.369
Come here. Come here.

01:16.242 --> 01:19.211
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19.245 --> 01:22.747
Look, I know that you
just came for your bag,

01:22.815 --> 01:24.562
but I-I think we should talk.

01:28.547 --> 01:32.027
OK... I'll start.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.355
I don't like that you took the
kids to your parents' house.

01:39.063 --> 01:40.454
He came to our house.

01:41.555 --> 01:43.614
Yes, but I did not invite him.

01:43.672 --> 01:46.096
No, you just kissed him on our street.

01:46.414 --> 01:49.508
He tried, I stopped him.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.800
You can't blame me for his mistake.

01:52.807 --> 01:55.800
It was a bad case, it... it bled out.

01:55.975 --> 01:58.726
Right, the same one your
father killed himself over,

01:59.507 --> 02:01.032
the one that had you
pouring over pictures

02:01.056 --> 02:03.554
- of dead girls every night.
- That's not fair.

02:05.660 --> 02:08.727
- OK.
- OK?

02:09.127 --> 02:10.300
I'm gonna be late.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.566
I just... I want you
to understand my side.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.935
- Oh, I understand.
- Your job is all you have room for,

02:17.003 --> 02:20.272
and the rest of us civilians,
we're on the outside.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.274
No. Uh...

02:22.308 --> 02:24.809
You're supposed to come home, Stevie.

02:25.248 --> 02:27.279
At the end of your
shift, you're supposed

02:27.313 --> 02:28.897
- to come home.
- But I am home.

02:28.922 --> 02:31.323
No, you're not.
You don't care about home

02:32.173 --> 02:34.040
unless Kyle has his car in front of it.

02:53.536 --> 02:55.307
Is she just gonna sneak out?

02:55.653 --> 02:56.973
Hi.

02:59.296 --> 03:00.979
Must be the morning breath.

03:04.262 --> 03:07.622
- What?
- That's Gerry.

03:07.730 --> 03:09.504
He was gonna be for the baby.

03:12.056 --> 03:15.739
Look, Jac. I went back home and I tried,

03:16.935 --> 03:19.370
but it just showed me why
I left in the first place.

03:19.395 --> 03:21.333
What do you want, Marc?

03:21.675 --> 03:24.669
I want this. I want you.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.241
I, uh, I gotta go.

03:38.407 --> 03:40.344
OK, at 6:30 this morning,

03:40.596 --> 03:43.134
a kitchen worker found
a body in a dumpster

03:43.159 --> 03:45.027
outside J and Y Foods.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.964
The victim had suffered
multiple puncture wounds

03:48.097 --> 03:50.580
before his body was doused
in gasoline and set on fire.

03:51.447 --> 03:54.712
The wounds are thin, cylindrical.
Traces of rust. Murder weapon is

03:54.737 --> 03:57.369
unconfirmed, but Forensics'
best bet is a screwdriver.

03:58.167 --> 03:59.414
Now the wounds were in different stages

03:59.438 --> 04:03.154
of healing, so we believe the
victim was held and tortured

04:03.560 --> 04:05.442
for a period of three days

04:05.467 --> 04:06.888
before the body was found.

04:07.346 --> 04:09.577
Oh, final thing: A dog collar

04:09.602 --> 04:11.547
was found tied around the victim's neck.

04:11.744 --> 04:12.859
Hey, Carl!

04:15.543 --> 04:18.010
Stand-up young man took it upon himself

04:18.035 --> 04:20.555
to share some photos online
before calling it in.

04:21.297 --> 04:23.497
OK, there's got to be some
kind of Millennial joke here.

04:23.529 --> 04:25.859
Yeah? Well, he got 30
likes and an arrest

04:25.884 --> 04:28.431
for indignity to a dead body.
So whatever the joke is,

04:28.595 --> 04:30.344
it's on him. Press is of course

04:30.369 --> 04:32.842
treating it like it's the
start of some sort of spree.

04:32.867 --> 04:34.330
Did we pull anything from the scene?

04:34.663 --> 04:37.521
Dumpster was a contaminant,
and whatever evidence was left

04:37.546 --> 04:39.318
- was burnt up.
- Dental records?

04:39.412 --> 04:42.216
A meth habit got to the
teeth before the perps did.

04:42.755 --> 04:45.850
- So we got nothing.
- But we have a limp.

04:45.885 --> 04:47.427
Sorry. Did you just say "limp"?

04:47.452 --> 04:49.688
Victim's left leg was two
inches shorter than the right,

04:49.722 --> 04:52.590
showed signs of an old surgery.
It would have been distinct,

04:52.625 --> 04:54.759
so I'm holding a press
conference to get that detail

04:54.794 --> 04:57.373
to the public. We'll set up a
private line for information.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.030
Don't you think having
a press conference

04:59.065 --> 05:00.876
isn't just gonna make it worse?
We're gonna be sitting around

05:00.900 --> 05:03.234
answering calls from whack
jobs and soccer moms all day.

05:03.259 --> 05:05.270
Wait, who's the boss? Oh right, I am!

05:06.311 --> 05:09.343
- Yeah. Good to be on same page.
- Right, absolutely. Listen,

05:09.368 --> 05:11.841
this guy was a vulnerable member
of society whose last days

05:11.866 --> 05:13.927
were filled with torture and fear,
so when we find

05:13.952 --> 05:16.073
the kind of person who could do
this to somebody, I'm gonna take

05:16.097 --> 05:17.957
great pleasure in watching
him go down for it.

05:18.019 --> 05:19.854
Alright, let's go. Could be a long day,

05:19.879 --> 05:22.285
long couple of days,
so get rest when you can.

05:22.588 --> 05:24.410
No, ma'am, we don't think it's related

05:24.435 --> 05:26.670
to the clowns in the woods.

05:26.876 --> 05:28.659
Yeah. No, they freak me out too.

05:29.161 --> 05:33.113
How long has it been? Yeah.

05:33.398 --> 05:34.521
Yeah, OK.

05:35.457 --> 05:38.092
Would you be willing to come
in and answer a few questions?

05:38.237 --> 05:40.872
Yeah. George Tate lost touch

05:40.906 --> 05:43.007
with his brother Leroy a few months ago.

05:43.041 --> 05:45.215
Leroy's got the limp.
He's got the meth habit.

05:45.611 --> 05:47.543
- He ticks all our boxes.
- Get a residence?

05:47.691 --> 05:50.159
- Yeah, Randall and Kaufman.
- Nice area too.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.745
- Take Forensics, head over.
- You two, talk to the brother

05:52.770 --> 05:55.496
when he comes in. Body's too
far gone to ID, but see

05:55.521 --> 05:58.322
- if he knows anything, alright?
- He burned through his share

05:58.357 --> 06:00.554
of the inheritance a couple
of years ago, and he started

06:00.578 --> 06:01.735
asking me for help.

06:02.928 --> 06:05.360
My wife wanted me to just cut him off,

06:05.390 --> 06:08.892
but I mean, you know,
what can I do? He's my brother.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.191
When was the last time you spoke to him?

06:14.880 --> 06:17.820
Last February. He came
to my son's birthday

06:17.845 --> 06:19.946
as if he was there to catch up.

06:20.279 --> 06:23.748
But Julie saw right through it and...
and things got...

06:23.782 --> 06:25.917
- they got kind of ugly.
- We are gonna do

06:25.951 --> 06:27.782
everything we can to figure this out.

06:28.153 --> 06:30.144
- Do you think it's him?
- That is

06:30.169 --> 06:32.284
what we wanted to talk
through with you, George.

06:32.738 --> 06:35.006
We would like to take a
blood sample from you.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.064
As we mentioned in the press conference,

06:37.089 --> 06:38.696
the body was subjected to fire,

06:39.368 --> 06:40.929
but from what you told us,

06:40.954 --> 06:43.093
the body is a close match to Leroy.

06:43.475 --> 06:44.773
How do you know it wasn't...?

06:45.155 --> 06:46.585
You said fire,

06:47.494 --> 06:50.640
- so maybe it was an accident.
- It appears

06:50.665 --> 06:52.114
as though the body had been through

06:52.139 --> 06:54.895
- a period of abuse.
- What kind of abuse?

06:55.489 --> 06:56.917
OK, George, um,

06:56.942 --> 06:59.744
please know that we will
not hold any information

06:59.777 --> 07:01.367
from you once we have determined

07:01.392 --> 07:04.875
the identity of the body, but for now,

07:05.479 --> 07:07.413
those details are not helpful.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.561
- OK. All right.
- We just want to focus

07:10.596 --> 07:12.597
our time on tracking whoever did this.

07:12.631 --> 07:15.740
- So, what can I do?
- Tell us about his addiction.

07:16.271 --> 07:17.740
We were skiing,

07:18.003 --> 07:19.471
and he broke his femur.

07:20.205 --> 07:21.971
So that's how he got his limp.

07:22.330 --> 07:23.931
Because he was in so much pain,

07:23.956 --> 07:26.124
they just refilled the prescription.

07:26.473 --> 07:28.328
Did they put any hardware

07:28.474 --> 07:30.408
in his leg? It would help us get an ID.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.391
Three pins and a plate...

07:33.685 --> 07:35.100
above the knee.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.162
The left leg.

07:41.626 --> 07:43.296
He IDed the same hardware

07:43.321 --> 07:45.830
that they found in the
coroner's report. It's Leroy.

07:45.864 --> 07:48.532
Have you heard back from Kyle
about the victim's residence?

07:48.600 --> 07:50.774
Typical. You know:
No food in the fridge, no furniture.

07:50.946 --> 07:52.889
Is, uh... is the brother

07:52.914 --> 07:54.715
- still in the building?
- Forensics is taking

07:54.740 --> 07:56.253
- a blood sample now.
- Think it'd be up

07:56.277 --> 07:58.719
for taking a walkthrough?
He could pinpoint something off,

07:58.744 --> 08:00.669
- something we missed.
- He didn't exactly

08:00.694 --> 08:02.833
- take it well.
- He'd come.

08:03.048 --> 08:05.701
- He really wants to help.
- Good. Then, you take him over,

08:05.726 --> 08:07.446
you build a rapport, but
when you get there,

08:07.519 --> 08:09.944
- watch how he reacts, right?
- Why? You think he's involved?

08:10.165 --> 08:12.109
Well, we can't rule that out.
You know, the abuse,

08:12.133 --> 08:14.772
the dog collar; These could be
signs of a sadistic revenge.

08:14.797 --> 08:17.890
And he did mention that
Leroy wasted his inheritance.

08:17.969 --> 08:19.937
So if he feels like he's
lost half a pot of money

08:19.978 --> 08:22.035
to an addict, you know,
people have killed for less.

08:22.234 --> 08:23.669
- OK.
- Great.

08:27.774 --> 08:28.787
Yeah?

08:28.852 --> 08:31.948
Uhhh, I just wanted to check and see

08:31.973 --> 08:34.730
- that we were OK.
- Do you think we're OK?

08:35.787 --> 08:37.123
- No.
- Good guess.

08:38.006 --> 08:40.051
- Fiona...
- It's done, Jac.

08:40.085 --> 08:42.919
Back to work now.

09:11.974 --> 09:13.224
I know this is difficult

09:13.248 --> 09:16.794
for you, George, but if
you could just focus

09:16.819 --> 09:19.263
on anything that strikes you as odd.

09:19.288 --> 09:20.692
This place, there's...

09:21.645 --> 09:24.463
there's nothing.
If I only would have known

09:24.488 --> 09:27.315
it had gotten this bad.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.190
Are you, uh... are you feeling OK?

09:31.387 --> 09:33.247
It's just allergies.

09:34.283 --> 09:36.724
Is there a dog here?

09:38.698 --> 09:41.028
- No.
- I don't know then.

09:42.005 --> 09:43.083
Mr. Tate,

09:43.377 --> 09:45.970
there was a dog collar
found with the body.

09:47.017 --> 09:48.595
What do you mean with "found with"?

09:48.828 --> 09:51.179
- At the scene.
- People will go

09:51.204 --> 09:53.672
to incredible lengths
to care for an animal,

09:54.083 --> 09:56.274
even if they can't take
care of themselves.

09:57.243 --> 09:59.352
Is it possible Leroy had a dog?

09:59.556 --> 10:01.477
He always wanted a husky. Our parents

10:01.502 --> 10:04.052
would never get one
because of my... my allergies.

10:04.548 --> 10:06.461
But I think a dog would
have made him happy.

10:07.196 --> 10:09.031
Do you think my brother was happy?

10:29.300 --> 10:30.385
Hey!

10:30.691 --> 10:32.867
I'm Jac. What are your names?

10:33.742 --> 10:35.824
I'm Barry. That's Hugo.

10:35.858 --> 10:37.698
You guys know the dude
who lives in that house?

10:37.860 --> 10:39.995
- Leroy?
- Yeah. You know him?

10:40.029 --> 10:41.910
Why? He got his dumb ass killed?

10:42.041 --> 10:44.098
- I'm afraid so.
- Damn!

10:44.434 --> 10:46.276
Lopsided Leroy got caught.

10:47.387 --> 10:48.878
You know who did it?

10:49.987 --> 10:51.673
Uh, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

10:51.708 --> 10:55.043
- I bet it was Tanya.
- Yeah, she was so done with his crap.

10:55.540 --> 10:56.563
Tanya?

10:57.081 --> 10:58.905
Yeah, I remember they
went at it last week.

10:59.139 --> 11:00.139
What do you mean?

11:00.170 --> 11:01.854
Lopsided Leroy is
like making a scene,

11:01.879 --> 11:03.752
yelling about some
money or something.

11:03.777 --> 11:06.213
Yeah. She's so big that he's
walking around her with a limp.

11:06.238 --> 11:07.588
And do you remember, like,

11:07.624 --> 11:10.926
damn if she didn't catch him.
Like, one clap to the side

11:10.960 --> 11:13.261
of the head and bam,
and he's all yelling about...

11:13.296 --> 11:17.032
Oh, I can't... I can't hear nothing.
Oh, oh, I... I can't hear nothing.

11:17.066 --> 11:18.521
So where would I find this Tanya?

11:19.102 --> 11:20.630
With the skanks in the park.

11:21.792 --> 11:23.105
Well, thanks.

11:28.199 --> 11:29.482
You think that's her?

11:30.013 --> 11:32.248
- Just whatever.
- Tanya?

11:32.982 --> 11:35.317
- OK. It's the cops.
- Tanya Pink?

11:36.766 --> 11:38.543
Just wanna ask you some questions.

11:39.489 --> 11:40.900
I haven't done nothing.

11:41.524 --> 11:43.705
- We just wanna talk.
- I'm not helping you.

11:43.993 --> 11:46.962
- What? Because we're cops?
- I'm just out for a walk,

11:46.996 --> 11:49.258
that's all. You got no
right to follow me.

11:49.852 --> 11:52.401
OK. Maybe we go and talk
to your friends over there,

11:52.435 --> 11:54.417
see if they're just out for a walk.

11:58.110 --> 11:59.751
Wanna talk to you about Leroy Tate.

12:00.176 --> 12:01.259
Leroy?

12:01.635 --> 12:03.736
- You know him?
- No.

12:06.115 --> 12:08.517
- This is Leroy.
- Ring any bells?

12:10.019 --> 12:12.220
Oh yeah. Leroy, huh?

12:12.864 --> 12:14.289
Walks a little...

12:14.950 --> 12:16.324
So you do know him.

12:16.565 --> 12:17.869
I didn't know that's his name,

12:18.261 --> 12:20.095
But yeah, maybe I've seen him.

12:20.479 --> 12:22.276
What do you mean by "seen him"?

12:23.633 --> 12:26.668
Do you wanna go somewhere
else to talk? Privately?

12:26.955 --> 12:29.097
What? Like Red Lobster?

12:29.739 --> 12:33.339
No, Tanya, not like Red Lobster.

12:35.554 --> 12:36.678
We're trying to place

12:36.713 --> 12:38.906
a timeline on Leroy's last few days.

12:39.146 --> 12:41.580
Unfortunately,
he was found dead this morning.

12:42.396 --> 12:44.119
Yeah.

12:44.584 --> 12:45.685
Yeah?

12:46.745 --> 12:47.963
I don't know.

12:50.586 --> 12:53.888
Are you surprised
that he's dead? You don't

12:53.913 --> 12:57.215
- seem particularly surprised.
- I don't get involved.

12:57.673 --> 13:00.226
- Involved with what?
- With nothing.

13:02.731 --> 13:04.268
You asked if I seen him. I said,

13:04.293 --> 13:08.196
"Yeah, I seen him,"
but I don't get involved, OK?

13:08.627 --> 13:09.725
That's fine.

13:10.417 --> 13:12.171
We're not here about your work.

13:13.968 --> 13:16.036
But we do have some eyewitness reports

13:16.061 --> 13:18.655
that place you at Leroy's
house just last week.

13:19.036 --> 13:21.804
The people we spoke with
said you two were fighting.

13:22.529 --> 13:23.553
What about?

13:24.927 --> 13:25.975
He's cheap.

13:27.864 --> 13:31.507
- I only seen him once or twice.
- He wasn't paying?

13:33.770 --> 13:36.654
- Did he have a dog?
- What do I care about a dog?

13:37.573 --> 13:38.956
What do you care?

13:39.326 --> 13:41.066
Leroy was murdered, Tanya.

13:42.042 --> 13:43.159
Brutally.

13:43.940 --> 13:45.413
Am I under arrest?

13:46.260 --> 13:48.750
Why would you say that?
We said we just wanted to talk to you.

13:48.785 --> 13:51.872
I don't want to talk no more.
I want a lawyer.

13:53.076 --> 13:54.422
OK, if that's what you want.

13:54.457 --> 13:56.095
And a good one too.

13:58.528 --> 14:01.564
OK, let's leave it there.
Wanna come with us?

14:06.836 --> 14:09.145
Can you show this young lady out?

14:09.292 --> 14:10.348
Thank you.

14:15.077 --> 14:17.612
- Anything?
- She knows something.

14:17.647 --> 14:20.769
We didn't have anything that'd stick.
She asked for a lawyer;

14:20.798 --> 14:22.865
- We couldn't keep her.
- Ahhh, great.

14:23.119 --> 14:25.180
Going on hour 12 and we got nothing.

14:26.696 --> 14:29.538
OK. Go home, get some rest,
see Jono and the kids.

14:29.563 --> 14:31.103
I want a fresh set of
eyes in the morning.

14:31.127 --> 14:32.405
I'll stay if that's OK.

14:32.769 --> 14:34.686
Send Jac. Her brother's over.

14:35.221 --> 14:37.856
How could I forget? OK, Cooper, go.

14:38.134 --> 14:40.268
Just keep him away from
any active murder scenes.

14:40.303 --> 14:42.688
We're kind of slammed as it is.

14:51.948 --> 14:53.081
All right.

15:01.457 --> 15:02.546
Hey.

15:03.998 --> 15:05.256
I bet you're starving.

15:05.690 --> 15:07.514
You're still here.

15:08.568 --> 15:09.671
And, uh...

15:10.608 --> 15:11.937
I made chicken.

15:15.972 --> 15:17.443
Straight for the wine, huh?

15:20.291 --> 15:21.392
Sorry.

15:21.417 --> 15:25.253
Like made made or ordered made?

15:25.723 --> 15:27.557
Your fridge was a little empty

15:27.582 --> 15:29.690
so I ran out to that butcher,

15:30.909 --> 15:32.420
and I got hot sauce,

15:32.581 --> 15:34.654
your favourite. All you need.

15:34.780 --> 15:36.191
Come on. Come and eat.

15:36.225 --> 15:39.418
I, uh, I didn't get
much sleep last night,

15:39.443 --> 15:43.221
so... you're planning on staying or...?

15:43.800 --> 15:44.980
You want me to go?

15:45.610 --> 15:46.657
Oh.

15:47.169 --> 15:50.530
I did a light tidy. Just, you
know, trying to be helpful.

15:56.627 --> 15:59.338
Uh, where... where is it?

15:59.715 --> 16:03.351
Where is what? You're untidying my tidy.

16:03.386 --> 16:05.587
Gerry. Where is Gerry?

16:05.621 --> 16:07.408
Oh, Gerry the giraffe.

16:10.026 --> 16:12.658
Where... where... where is he, Marc?

16:12.768 --> 16:15.728
- I threw it out.
- What?!

16:16.532 --> 16:20.068
I just think you need to move on.
Jac, what are you doing?

16:20.440 --> 16:23.737
- Jac? Jac, stop!
- Why did you do that?

16:23.940 --> 16:27.709
- It was morbid.
- You don't get to decide that!

16:31.648 --> 16:33.867
I was doing everything right.

16:34.376 --> 16:37.265
I... I was actually trying to process.

16:38.593 --> 16:39.929
I was mourning,

16:40.882 --> 16:42.944
and you took that away from me.

16:43.843 --> 16:45.288
So just go!

16:45.804 --> 16:47.762
- Go!
- Jac. Jac, stop, stop.

16:47.797 --> 16:50.298
I'll get it. Look, I'm sor...
I'll get it.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.767
OK? Come on. In your work clothes?

16:55.096 --> 16:57.998
OK, all right.

16:58.074 --> 17:00.869
Here. Here he is. Here I am! Here I am.

17:01.307 --> 17:02.359
Uh...

17:02.726 --> 17:04.560
I'm sorry I threw out your stuffie.

17:07.916 --> 17:09.595
I can't do this.

17:11.287 --> 17:13.506
I know.

17:18.209 --> 17:19.659
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.932
We need you back. We got another body.

17:22.131 --> 17:23.955
- Oh, another one?
- Yeah, fresh.

17:23.981 --> 17:26.883
No fire, but the stab wounds
are the same diameter

17:26.907 --> 17:29.631
as the first murder.
Same flecks of rust.

17:30.306 --> 17:33.408
And the body is in a truck park

17:33.442 --> 17:35.183
three blocks away from the first.

17:36.112 --> 17:37.412
You OK to come in?

17:40.300 --> 17:41.649
Yeah, I'm good.

17:41.984 --> 17:45.020
- Text me the details.
- OK.

17:49.684 --> 17:51.246
Did you check the pockets?

17:52.069 --> 17:54.332
Uh, no. Not yet.

18:05.048 --> 18:06.449
Oh, a phone number

18:06.484 --> 18:08.923
from one of those tearaway
posters, the kind people

18:08.948 --> 18:11.099
- put up for missing dogs.
- Call Fiona.

18:11.186 --> 18:13.788
- Yep.
- These quick solves

18:13.993 --> 18:15.443
are gonna go straight to her head.

18:18.529 --> 18:19.852
Why didn't you go home to get some rest?

18:19.876 --> 18:21.595
Fiona gave you the chance,
you didn't take it.

18:21.619 --> 18:23.138
Wanted to see this one though.

18:23.868 --> 18:26.194
Really? What makes this one different?

18:28.038 --> 18:29.038
Huh?

18:29.707 --> 18:31.263
- Are you being serious?
- Murder's a murder;

18:31.287 --> 18:32.988
It's not like the first
victim was a saint.

18:34.877 --> 18:36.274
Are you looking for a fight?

18:36.421 --> 18:37.883
I'm looking for a detective, Stevie;

18:37.908 --> 18:39.560
Maybe you wanna ask Cooper
to point one out.

18:39.584 --> 18:42.170
- What the hell, Kyle?
- You skipped the pockets Stevie.

18:42.485 --> 18:45.156
That sets us back an hour.
OK, this isn't therapy.

18:45.181 --> 18:47.047
Don't come to work 'cause you're
trying to get away from the crap

18:47.071 --> 18:49.339
- that's going on at home.
- That's rich coming from you.

18:49.560 --> 18:53.066
No... You know what
the difference is, Stevie?

18:53.091 --> 18:55.131
Me, Cooper, we're better for it.

19:01.612 --> 19:04.681
Paul Giggs? Hi.
I'm Detective Jac Cooper.

19:04.706 --> 19:07.908
- This is Detective Stevie Hall.
- This is my husband Roy.

19:08.179 --> 19:10.380
Thanks for coming in so early.
Take a seat.

19:10.641 --> 19:12.445
We were already up. Early risers.

19:12.470 --> 19:14.087
So tell us about this missing dog.

19:14.216 --> 19:16.547
- This is Baracus.
- Gate wouldn't latch.

19:16.597 --> 19:18.719
We put up the missing
posters the next day.

19:19.123 --> 19:21.067
It's been two weeks now so
we're kind of freaking out.

19:21.091 --> 19:23.496
Uh, how much was the
reward that you offered?

19:23.694 --> 19:25.361
Figured a hundred would be enough,

19:25.387 --> 19:27.572
but we got this call
from this guy asking

19:27.606 --> 19:29.874
for $5000 to get our dog back.

19:30.234 --> 19:32.433
- And when was this?
- Last Friday.

19:33.070 --> 19:34.726
- Did you get a name?
- No,

19:34.751 --> 19:38.109
I'm afraid not. But when we got to
the park, the guy looked rough.

19:38.134 --> 19:40.243
You know, to be honest,
the guy looked kind of scary.

19:40.277 --> 19:43.043
- Could you describe him?
- Uh, dark hoodie,

19:43.068 --> 19:45.269
kind of, I don't know, weaselly.

19:45.378 --> 19:46.913
He didn't get very close.

19:47.969 --> 19:51.205
He seemed high. We weren't
surprised he needed the money.

19:51.388 --> 19:53.748
I said, "You're not getting
the money until we get our dog."

19:54.302 --> 19:55.692
And that's when he got aggressive.

19:55.983 --> 19:57.388
Said he was gonna take the money.

19:58.042 --> 20:00.174
Thank God, we saw a bike cop riding by.

20:00.275 --> 20:02.143
And the guy took off
as soon as he saw her.

20:02.372 --> 20:05.708
And did you happen to save the
phone number of the person who called?

20:07.564 --> 20:08.636
Yeah.

20:10.307 --> 20:11.608
Look, please,

20:11.642 --> 20:13.200
losing him has been really hard;

20:13.386 --> 20:15.454
We just want Baracus back alive.

20:17.735 --> 20:20.036
Hi. You've reached Jono Hall.
Sorry I missed your call.

20:20.150 --> 20:22.599
Hey. Everything OK?

20:23.326 --> 20:24.732
Yeah, it's fine, um...

20:26.123 --> 20:28.776
It's nothing. It's fine. It's fine.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.934
Hey! Phone number came back to a burner.

20:32.959 --> 20:35.319
The genius bought the
phone with a debit card.

20:35.514 --> 20:38.395
So traced the bank
account back to... guess.

20:38.769 --> 20:40.114
- Aaron...
- No, no, this is good,

20:40.139 --> 20:42.630
- you should guess.
- Holy...

20:43.039 --> 20:44.067
Idiot.

20:44.826 --> 20:47.528
Ohhh! That is actually really good.

20:47.858 --> 20:49.072
Guess, Stevie.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.869
- Jac.
- Sorry.

20:52.471 --> 20:54.288
- "Dustin Pink"?
- Tanya's brother.

20:54.481 --> 20:56.788
- Oh, damn...
- Guess we got a couple

20:56.813 --> 20:59.481
- more questions for our gal.
- Did you hear the news?

21:00.124 --> 21:03.493
Stevie, get Price! Go fetch our
lovely lady, will you? Jac, Aaron,

21:03.527 --> 21:05.129
pick up the brother! Let's move!

21:11.986 --> 21:13.653
Nice place.

21:15.813 --> 21:16.847
Are we fine?

21:18.209 --> 21:19.681
Yeah, we're fine.

21:20.244 --> 21:21.744
This is about the other night?

21:22.368 --> 21:24.147
- What did you think?
- What?

21:24.181 --> 21:26.599
Hmm? That you could just...

21:27.284 --> 21:29.446
come back into my life, blow it up?

21:29.471 --> 21:30.988
I wasn't thinking, Stevie; I was acting.

21:31.012 --> 21:32.385
It was honest, it had to be said.

21:32.410 --> 21:36.525
You were the one that went away!
You were unreliable then,

21:36.694 --> 21:37.798
you still are!

21:39.430 --> 21:41.408
What do I have to say to
you to make you understand

21:41.432 --> 21:43.010
that I do not want you?

21:44.347 --> 21:46.836
I chose Jono. Twice.

21:54.819 --> 21:56.589
It should be right around the corner.

22:05.923 --> 22:08.158
Oh, look who's paying
her brother a visit.

22:08.192 --> 22:10.260
- That's Tanya Pink?
- Yeah. Off you go.

22:10.294 --> 22:11.470
All right.

22:12.196 --> 22:14.764
I got Tanya Pink outside
Dustin's house, back alley...

22:14.799 --> 22:16.766
- Come on!
- She's making a run for it.

22:23.808 --> 22:26.242
Oh-oh! Ugh!

22:26.277 --> 22:28.178
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go, go!

22:30.548 --> 22:32.668
Tanya?

22:45.329 --> 22:48.398
Hey! Get off! Get off Jac!

22:48.432 --> 22:50.535
- Get off!
- Bitch deserved what she got!

22:50.797 --> 22:52.314
- Get off me!
- Up against the car!

22:52.339 --> 22:53.446
Let's go! Get up there!

22:53.471 --> 22:56.940
Now! Hands behind your head!
Hey, you all right?

22:57.410 --> 22:58.723
Jesus, Aaron!

23:01.559 --> 23:03.346
Hands behind your back! Let's go!

23:08.059 --> 23:11.395
- Hey, what happened back there?
- What do you mean?

23:12.148 --> 23:13.686
It looked, ahem...

23:14.283 --> 23:16.250
She was choking you, all right.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.951
Use of your weapon was justified,

23:18.154 --> 23:19.692
but it looked like you just let go.

23:19.912 --> 23:21.861
No. You had her cuffed.

23:26.833 --> 23:28.559
- Did medical clear you?
- All good.

23:28.635 --> 23:30.903
Good! OK, to catch you up,

23:30.938 --> 23:33.445
Forensics is working on IDing
the prints from John Doe

23:33.470 --> 23:35.263
and we have Sullivan on
Dustin Pink's house,

23:35.288 --> 23:38.022
though it looks like he split town.
Stevie, I want you

23:38.047 --> 23:40.188
to take the rest of
Tanya's interrogation solo.

23:40.814 --> 23:42.943
- Yeah, no kidding.
- The vehicle registered

23:42.968 --> 23:45.560
to Dustin Pink rear-ended an
off-duty cop about a year ago.

23:45.585 --> 23:46.919
Meth and fentanyl in the trunk.

23:47.471 --> 23:49.711
So what's more prudent
for our investigation

23:49.736 --> 23:51.791
is who was in the car.
Three people, each

23:51.859 --> 23:55.078
with more priors than the last:
Ruby Palmer, possession,

23:55.103 --> 23:57.549
solicitation; Joshua Livingston,

23:57.705 --> 24:00.112
aggravated assault,
trafficking, possession

24:00.150 --> 24:03.378
of a prohibited weapon;
And our first victim,

24:04.033 --> 24:05.197
Leroy Tate.

24:05.306 --> 24:07.659
Now, Josh and Ruby have gone dark,
but with their records,

24:07.692 --> 24:08.848
it's only a matter of
time before they're

24:08.872 --> 24:10.960
picked up again. We got
uniforms, parole officers

24:10.985 --> 24:13.140
- all trying to find 'em.
- So our main focus

24:13.165 --> 24:14.398
is Dustin Pink.

24:15.142 --> 24:17.811
Now I know most of you have been
on this for more than 24 hours,

24:17.887 --> 24:21.156
but we're close. So don't get
sloppy, let's get this done.

24:21.308 --> 24:22.315
OK.

24:27.089 --> 24:28.508
Have you had any thoughts

24:28.877 --> 24:30.555
since the incident, Tanya?

24:30.855 --> 24:32.624
Anything you want to tell us?

24:34.787 --> 24:37.093
Ask me maybe about your situation?

24:39.724 --> 24:42.259
OK. Let's keep going.

24:44.310 --> 24:48.038
Do you know someone by the
name of Joshua Livingston?

24:51.321 --> 24:53.110
What about Ruby Palmer?

24:54.230 --> 24:55.244
No.

24:55.298 --> 24:56.738
Have you spoken with Dustin?

24:57.707 --> 24:58.807
No.

24:59.259 --> 25:01.693
We believe that Josh and Ruby

25:01.718 --> 25:03.408
are friends of your brother.

25:04.939 --> 25:06.486
Is that the case?

25:08.708 --> 25:10.151
No comment.

25:11.604 --> 25:14.766
Dustin has been arrested
with Josh and Ruby in the past.

25:15.408 --> 25:17.141
Leroy Tate was also with them.

25:17.610 --> 25:19.353
No comment.

25:19.931 --> 25:21.056
Last time we spoke, you said

25:21.081 --> 25:23.275
that you would like to
have a lawyer present.

25:25.266 --> 25:26.399
No comment.

25:43.699 --> 25:45.666
The prints just came
back from the big guy,

25:45.691 --> 25:47.792
the second victim. It's Dustin Pink.

25:48.907 --> 25:50.867
- Well, that changes things.
- And there's more.

25:50.892 --> 25:53.755
Detective sergeant from 5 called;
He's got an informant

25:53.780 --> 25:56.609
who just made a buy at
an address in Scarborough

25:56.634 --> 25:59.103
- of Josh and Ruby.
- Who's going?

25:59.128 --> 26:02.018
Everyone. After Tanya's stunt,
I'm not taking anything for granted.

26:02.530 --> 26:04.042
You mind if I use that?

26:04.538 --> 26:07.107
Dustin's death might open her up.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.035
What? With this chatterbox?

26:09.309 --> 26:10.722
Be my guest.

26:23.009 --> 26:24.827
We have some news, Tanya.

26:25.991 --> 26:27.145
No comment.

26:27.718 --> 26:29.114
I'm afraid to inform you

26:29.148 --> 26:31.083
that we have located your brother.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.754
He's dead.

26:36.886 --> 26:40.022
- Somebody killed him.
- No comment.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.746
Tanya, I'm not asking for a comment.

26:44.215 --> 26:45.531
I'm very sorry.

26:46.221 --> 26:47.533
We found his body

26:47.567 --> 26:50.903
bearing similar wounds to
those found on Leroy Tate.

26:57.443 --> 26:59.254
No comment.

27:06.143 --> 27:10.422
- All right, go, go!
- Police search warrant!

27:12.959 --> 27:14.077
Clear!

27:16.507 --> 27:17.718
We're clear!

27:19.499 --> 27:20.741
Let's check downstairs.

27:21.601 --> 27:24.102
- Clear!
- North room clear!

27:25.447 --> 27:26.500
Clear!

27:29.943 --> 27:30.992
Clear!

27:32.310 --> 27:33.320
Clear!

27:35.848 --> 27:38.989
We got a cook operation.
Everybody, get out of here!

27:39.223 --> 27:41.423
- I'm calling the crime lab guys.
- Give me two minutes.

27:41.721 --> 27:42.790
Hurry!

27:45.809 --> 27:47.369
- Finch you got the dog.
- Yeah. It's here.

27:47.393 --> 27:49.030
- Come here, boy! Come here!
- It's OK. Come here, come here.

27:49.054 --> 27:51.990
Come on. Good boy!

27:58.071 --> 28:00.590
- Murder room.
- Not much of a cleanup job.

28:01.307 --> 28:03.627
C'mon, let's get out of here.
We gotta sweep the top floor.

28:09.749 --> 28:11.833
- Clear!
- Clear!

28:16.177 --> 28:18.546
Hey! Get out of there. Let's go!

28:19.295 --> 28:21.656
Come on!

28:22.695 --> 28:24.177
Stand up! Turn around, face the wall!

28:24.831 --> 28:25.882
Turn around.

28:28.001 --> 28:30.102
Turn around! Up against the wall!
Hands on your head!

28:30.191 --> 28:32.207
- Don't move!
- What's your name?

28:32.754 --> 28:34.410
- Identify yourself.
- Josh.

28:34.703 --> 28:37.966
- Josh what?
- Joshua Lawson Livingston.

28:38.184 --> 28:39.604
- Ruby!
- Ruby what?

28:39.629 --> 28:41.373
Ruby Palmer. What do you want?

28:41.673 --> 28:43.953
Josh Livingston, Ruby Palmer,

28:44.610 --> 28:47.178
you're under arrest for
suspicion of murder.

28:47.353 --> 28:50.922
What?! WAIT! WAIT!

28:58.166 --> 29:00.385
We've just brought in Josh and Ruby.

29:01.637 --> 29:02.666
OK.

29:05.439 --> 29:07.328
You understand that
if you don't cooperate,

29:07.353 --> 29:08.570
I can't help you?

29:10.502 --> 29:11.710
Do you want my help?

29:13.877 --> 29:14.885
OK.

29:16.924 --> 29:18.684
Did you murder your brother?

29:20.687 --> 29:22.564
Then why are you helping whoever did?

29:22.662 --> 29:25.032
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

29:25.392 --> 29:26.754
By not answering me.

29:29.924 --> 29:33.027
My colleagues are talking
to Josh and Ruby right now;

29:34.145 --> 29:35.552
You think they'll be covering for you

29:35.576 --> 29:38.111
- like you are for them?
- We are investigating

29:38.136 --> 29:40.525
the murders of Leroy
Tate and Dustin Pink.

29:40.855 --> 29:42.853
For the sake of simplicity,
I think we should separate

29:42.877 --> 29:46.045
these two murders and just focus
on the first one: Leroy Tate.

29:46.316 --> 29:48.321
Can you tell me what you
know about Leroy's death?

29:49.012 --> 29:50.241
No comment.

29:51.141 --> 29:53.695
Do you know this man? It's Leroy Tate,

29:53.720 --> 29:55.721
- the man who was murdered.
- No comment.

29:55.765 --> 29:56.807
All right.

29:57.300 --> 29:59.371
Um, you work with Tanya;

29:59.396 --> 30:01.464
You must know her brother Dustin.

30:02.316 --> 30:03.519
No comment.

30:04.263 --> 30:06.449
Was that your dog that
we found at the house?

30:07.352 --> 30:08.446
No comment.

30:08.959 --> 30:11.994
- Who did the dog belong to?
- No comment.

30:12.271 --> 30:13.339
Who took the dog?

30:15.640 --> 30:19.703
- Was it Dustin? Leroy?
- I don't know.

30:19.949 --> 30:22.451
Was it Leroy's plan to take the dog?

30:22.569 --> 30:24.837
♪ Nooooo ♪

30:24.862 --> 30:26.863
- ♪ Comment ♪
- Can I remind you

30:26.888 --> 30:29.159
that you are here under
charges for murder,

30:29.184 --> 30:31.218
a horrific murder where a man was held,

30:31.519 --> 30:34.921
tortured and set on fire? If you look up

30:34.946 --> 30:37.541
at those cameras there,
you'll find that they are recording.

30:37.566 --> 30:40.501
Do you think a jury will appreciate
the way that you're behaving?

30:41.360 --> 30:43.845
So maybe just don't sing at me, yeah?

30:49.609 --> 30:52.231
- Do you think I can see him?
- Your brother?

30:54.614 --> 30:56.536
Let me see what I can do.

31:37.149 --> 31:38.664
It was all that dog.

31:40.182 --> 31:41.299
We were out,

31:41.979 --> 31:43.592
and it just came up to him.

31:46.037 --> 31:48.015
Ruby and I were hanging out
when they just showed up

31:48.039 --> 31:49.936
at home with it. It was like...

31:51.107 --> 31:52.698
OK, I guess we got a pet.

31:54.169 --> 31:55.786
Ruby's got a brain

31:55.811 --> 31:56.931
works kind of funny,

31:58.137 --> 31:59.306
spinning all the time.

32:00.392 --> 32:01.775
What was she thinking?

32:03.575 --> 32:05.228
She said someone would
give money for it.

32:06.789 --> 32:08.172
And Leroy says, you know,

32:08.197 --> 32:09.540
"Let me take care of it."

32:11.885 --> 32:13.056
'Cause he liked it.

32:14.301 --> 32:15.314
He did.

32:16.499 --> 32:17.567
He really liked it.

32:17.992 --> 32:19.447
The dog liked him too.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.773
That's why he wanted to keep him.

32:24.702 --> 32:26.555
- For himself?
- Yeah.

32:29.483 --> 32:30.693
'Cause he loved it.

32:36.187 --> 32:37.803
Tanya's talking, Josh.

32:38.603 --> 32:40.804
She's telling us a little
bit about this dog.

32:41.503 --> 32:44.591
She says Leroy was just
taking care of it.

32:47.972 --> 32:50.537
We're getting answers. She doesn't seem

32:50.562 --> 32:53.026
particularly happy about
what happened to her brother,

32:53.051 --> 32:56.323
so it's in your best
interest to start talking.

32:56.876 --> 32:57.969
All right.

32:58.830 --> 33:01.650
But listen, I'm innocent in all this.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.432
Taking care... that's a laugh.

33:05.466 --> 33:08.076
Leroy wanted that dog
because he wanted the reward.

33:08.503 --> 33:10.381
Dustin wanted the reward.

33:11.192 --> 33:13.264
But Dustin, he isn't reasonable.

33:13.581 --> 33:15.374
And then Leroy goes silent.

33:15.399 --> 33:17.667
He's not texting us.
He's not answering our calls.

33:17.948 --> 33:19.640
It "weren't enough to talk."

33:20.819 --> 33:22.022
Not for Josh.

33:23.055 --> 33:24.966
He says he's got to
teach Leroy a lesson.

33:26.064 --> 33:27.700
He's talking about this dog like it's...

33:28.536 --> 33:30.105
like a diamond or something,

33:32.064 --> 33:33.134
like it's personal.

33:34.014 --> 33:37.017
- He wanted to hurt him.
- It's kind of, uh...

33:38.500 --> 33:39.948
foggy, you know?

33:40.478 --> 33:42.986
Ha! Memory's not so good!

33:43.862 --> 33:45.893
Dustin asked me if I seen Leroy.

33:48.386 --> 33:50.159
Maybe I could get him to talk.

33:50.616 --> 33:51.899
He was nice

33:52.065 --> 33:53.282
when he was with the dog.

33:55.478 --> 33:59.020
And then Dustin kicked off.
Tanya grabbed Leroy,

33:59.091 --> 34:01.512
put him in the trunk. Violent, right?

34:02.461 --> 34:03.633
She's a violent kid.

34:05.351 --> 34:06.523
But Josh wanted the dog,

34:06.548 --> 34:08.650
so he could buy some new beakers

34:09.467 --> 34:10.937
'cause he's selling
crystal out of that house.

34:10.960 --> 34:14.123
Did you know that? I can tell you.
I can tell you all about it.

34:14.444 --> 34:16.812
I help you and you help me.
That's how this works, right?

34:17.304 --> 34:19.639
I didn't know they were
gonna do that to him.

34:22.045 --> 34:23.484
I followed him home, and...

34:24.621 --> 34:26.039
Josh was like...

34:27.793 --> 34:29.485
I never seen anybody like that.

34:31.356 --> 34:32.601
He was so mad.

34:33.208 --> 34:34.547
What happened at the house?

34:34.859 --> 34:36.297
Josh and Dustin tied him up.

34:37.783 --> 34:39.181
Josh took the dog.

34:40.848 --> 34:43.014
Ruby took the collar,
and she put it on Leroy.

34:44.878 --> 34:46.525
It's just not right doing that to him.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.851
Josh had the screwdriver in his hands,

34:51.663 --> 34:54.011
and I said,
"What are you gonna do with that?"

34:55.991 --> 34:57.200
"That's what."

34:58.027 --> 34:59.138
Why did you keep him?

34:59.784 --> 35:01.450
Leroy, he's kept all that time;

35:02.403 --> 35:03.520
Why not just end it?

35:03.657 --> 35:05.624
'Cause he didn't know
when to keep his mouth shut.

35:06.058 --> 35:07.620
I do. I know better than to say

35:07.645 --> 35:09.680
nothing at Josh and Dustin
when they're like that.

35:10.162 --> 35:11.612
He just made it worse for himself.

35:11.871 --> 35:14.528
So what happened to Dustin? After?

35:14.680 --> 35:16.442
Well, he lost his mind

35:16.467 --> 35:18.435
because Ruby said that
Tanya had been pinched

35:18.460 --> 35:21.017
by one of your lot. So
he was gonna go down

35:21.042 --> 35:24.044
and confess about it.
Ruby wasn't gonna have that.

35:24.431 --> 35:27.310
Ruby did that to Dustin all by herself?

35:30.925 --> 35:32.193
On my dead mother.

35:41.565 --> 35:43.888
- The security cam got the whole thing.
- Mm-hmm

35:52.859 --> 35:53.973
Oh!

35:56.825 --> 35:58.451
Anyone make any sense of this?

36:01.991 --> 36:03.425
OK, that's it.

36:03.626 --> 36:05.786
I've had it. Let their lawyers
figure out who did what.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.979
Tanya may not have stabbed
him herself, but she's just

36:08.004 --> 36:10.205
as responsible as any of them.
Charge all three

36:10.230 --> 36:12.443
with the murder of Leroy
Tate and Dustin Pink.

36:16.886 --> 36:18.046
Thank you.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.011
Hey Tanya.

36:20.036 --> 36:21.770
They said you gave the dog back.

36:23.539 --> 36:26.074
Yeah. The owners are on
their way to pick it up now.

36:27.041 --> 36:28.410
Do you believe in, like,

36:28.930 --> 36:29.993
destiny?

36:32.348 --> 36:34.750
- How so?
- Me and Dustin,

36:35.041 --> 36:36.845
we been alone since we were young.

36:38.525 --> 36:40.288
Dustin likes these jokes.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.894
It was the jokes that
made Josh like him,

36:47.011 --> 36:48.930
made Josh want to smoke with us.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.767
Now he's gone, I don't know,

36:52.353 --> 36:54.205
maybe if Mom hadn't OD'ed,

36:54.728 --> 36:57.665
maybe we wouldn't have
ended up with Josh and Ruby.

36:58.681 --> 37:00.176
Maybe we would have ended up OK.

37:27.804 --> 37:31.973
You like it?

37:32.008 --> 37:35.844
Let me put it on. Hey, hey.

37:37.484 --> 37:38.858
What happened here?

37:41.214 --> 37:42.441
Work today.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.329
Went chasing down some rough chick.

37:45.354 --> 37:48.147
She got her hands on my neck,

37:48.858 --> 37:52.227
and it was pretty close.

37:54.140 --> 37:55.343
You know what I thought?

37:55.665 --> 37:59.124
I thought, just for one second,

37:59.669 --> 38:01.395
"Wouldn't it be nice

38:02.205 --> 38:05.005
to just go to sleep?"

38:05.935 --> 38:07.075
That's not...

38:07.143 --> 38:10.178
Jesus, Jac, that's not... OK.
I can't say that.

38:10.844 --> 38:12.860
I was serious when I told you to go.

38:14.957 --> 38:17.613
You can't be alone right now,
not after saying something like that.

38:17.661 --> 38:20.027
You think I want to be alone?

38:20.223 --> 38:22.067
So let's not be alone.

38:22.684 --> 38:25.403
You got a family, Marc;
I don't need that

38:25.428 --> 38:28.235
on my conscience on top
of everything else.

38:28.766 --> 38:30.332
You wanna talk about family?

38:30.366 --> 38:33.148
- Nope.
- She found out.

38:34.132 --> 38:35.523
She knows...

38:35.738 --> 38:38.125
everything, so no,

38:39.298 --> 38:41.266
I-I don't have a family to go home to.

38:41.445 --> 38:42.758
It's not my problem.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.889
Emily knows, so...

38:56.014 --> 38:58.015
the crap you pulled with the condo,

38:58.040 --> 38:59.734
that's not gonna work for you anymore

39:00.196 --> 39:02.018
because this is my property.

39:02.149 --> 39:04.112
Well, you signed it over to me.

39:05.479 --> 39:07.068
I'm a lawyer, Jac,

39:07.103 --> 39:09.491
you really want to go down that road?
I'd love to see you

39:09.522 --> 39:12.156
explain to a judge how this
place ended up in your name.

39:14.075 --> 39:17.304
If you, uh, if you don't
want to try to make it work,

39:18.381 --> 39:19.854
then just get out of my condo.

39:46.241 --> 39:48.280
I didn't come here to
make trouble for you.

39:48.991 --> 39:50.163
I'm sorry I did.

39:51.030 --> 39:52.715
Why did you have to come back?

39:53.933 --> 39:55.464
The superintendent's choice.

39:57.230 --> 39:58.337
You could have fought it.

39:58.460 --> 39:59.512
I didn't.

40:03.583 --> 40:04.599
Why?

40:19.077 --> 40:21.610
Spent half my life
pretending it was over.

40:25.233 --> 40:26.889
Just didn't want to do it anymore.

40:38.194 --> 40:39.982
I just don't feel anything anymore.

40:41.123 --> 40:42.602
I thought I'd get past it.

40:43.547 --> 40:45.641
Thought maybe her affair

40:45.680 --> 40:47.360
happening at the beginning
of our marriage,

40:47.403 --> 40:49.671
that maybe, I don't know, we'd be better

40:49.705 --> 40:51.591
for having gone through it, but...

40:52.693 --> 40:54.706
now that I see it happening
again, I just...

40:55.636 --> 40:57.112
I don't know. I don't even care.

40:58.214 --> 40:59.347
Is that awful?

40:59.415 --> 41:01.345
No. It's honest.

41:02.571 --> 41:04.853
But I'm sorry, we're gonna
have to stop there.

41:05.126 --> 41:06.927
Seriously, that was like 10 minutes.

41:07.560 --> 41:11.533
- You were enjoying yourself?
- Yeah. I like talking to you.

41:12.127 --> 41:14.896
Well, I... got you in

41:14.921 --> 41:17.572
next week at the same time,
so we can pick it up there.

41:19.142 --> 41:22.203
Or we could keep talking
over scotch at the Duke.

41:23.542 --> 41:26.741
- I don't drink with patients.
- Then you're fired.

41:28.577 --> 41:30.652
OK, we can talk about this next week.

41:31.363 --> 41:32.824
And you've been making these comments,

41:32.848 --> 41:34.883
and it's perfectly normal

41:34.917 --> 41:37.018
to project feelings onto your therapist,

41:37.053 --> 41:39.054
but, um... we should talk about it.

41:39.088 --> 41:40.525
We should talk about it...

41:41.994 --> 41:43.963
over a scotch.

41:44.869 --> 41:46.247
Like, I... I don't know,

41:46.595 --> 41:49.037
maybe it's normal for
patients, but, uh...

41:50.583 --> 41:51.861
what about therapists?

41:52.305 --> 41:58.161
