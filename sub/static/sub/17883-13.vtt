WEBVTT

00:05.572 --> 00:06.138
Morning, boss.

00:06.140 --> 00:09.008
Top of the morning to you.
Got a little mission for you.

00:09.010 --> 00:09.641
I'm kind of busy.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.777
You got 15 seconds
to defuse this bomb,

00:11.779 --> 00:12.444
or we're all pink mist.

00:12.446 --> 00:15.948
What? No! I'm a hacker!
I don't know how to do this!

00:15.950 --> 00:18.150
Consider it a pop quiz.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.318
Uh...

00:19.320 --> 00:20.419
Uh... Uh...

00:20.421 --> 00:24.189
Oh, no, I don't... Uh, uh...
Google. Google.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.991
Okay. "Giant bombs."

00:25.993 --> 00:28.627
No, no, not
Nicolas Cage movies!

00:31.899 --> 00:34.033
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die!

00:38.038 --> 00:40.005
Oh!

00:40.007 --> 00:42.307
Classic Oz.
What'd he do this time?

00:42.309 --> 00:46.211
Oh, dude.
Another one of his stupid tests.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.647
Seriously, dude,
I'm sick of 'em.

00:51.151 --> 00:51.617
Oh!

00:51.619 --> 00:54.386
Okay. Find your way home,
using only these items.

00:54.388 --> 00:58.857
Bowie knife,
matches, some olives.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.859
See you back
at the office, kid!

01:00.861 --> 01:02.995
I mean, seriously, what is
he always testing me for?

01:02.997 --> 01:05.497
I wish he'd just leave me alone
and let me hack.

01:05.499 --> 01:06.131
I'm not a leader.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.766
I'll never say, "I'll allow it,"
like he does.

01:07.768 --> 01:11.103
Hello.
I'm looking for my niece, Molly Hughes.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.840
Holy balls! It's him! It's him!
Hi.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.821
It's him.
It's Peter Mayhew.

01:28.823 --> 01:29.455
It's Chewbacca!

01:29.457 --> 01:31.690
Do you know
what this means?

01:31.692 --> 01:32.391
This means I'm in love

01:32.393 --> 01:33.625
with the uncle of the woman
that I'm in love with.

01:33.627 --> 01:37.062
Okay, well, they're coming over here,
so get yourself together.

01:37.064 --> 01:37.830
I can't, I can't. I can't.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.298
He was inside one of my favorite
characters of all time.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.066
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

01:41.068 --> 01:42.401
Cameron, my uncle
needs Oz's help.

01:42.403 --> 01:45.104
Uh, okay, cool.
Let's go to the conference room.

01:45.106 --> 01:49.441
Well, actually, the conference
room is currently unavailable.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.445
Oh, hey, guys.
Check it out.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.079
It's the toy piano

01:54.081 --> 01:58.550
from that movie with Tom Hanks
where that lady rapes a kid.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.353
Actually, this job
is rather, uh, delicate.

02:01.355 --> 02:04.456
Is there somewhere
we could go to be more discreet?

02:05.526 --> 02:08.293
What are you doing?
Uh, uh, nothing.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.499
All right, Mr. Mayhew.
You're off the grid. What's the story?

02:13.501 --> 02:16.435
I was in a moving picture
called  <i>Star Wars.</i>

02:16.437 --> 02:16.835
Hmm.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.138
My character
was named Chewbacca.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.139
Um, yeah,
we've all seen it.

02:20.141 --> 02:23.609
Uncle Peter was scheduled
to do a fan convention in San Diego.

02:23.611 --> 02:27.779
As always, he traveled with
the original Chewbacca suit.

02:27.781 --> 02:31.550
<i>Someone stole it and mocked us</i>
<i>in the process.</i>

02:31.552 --> 02:34.887
Any ideas on who snaked
your space mink?

02:34.889 --> 02:35.654
Well, it could be anyone.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.723
One collector
offered $5 million for it,

02:37.725 --> 02:41.927
and my uncle is willing to pay half
that for its return.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.529
Well, you two are in luck.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.464
You'll get the friends-and-family
discount.

02:45.466 --> 02:48.033
We'll do it
for $2 million flat.

02:48.501 --> 02:49.067
Deal.

02:49.069 --> 02:52.037
Do what it takes,
and no questions asked.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.339
We're gonna punch it, Chewie.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.242
Molly, hold up. You never told
me you're from Wookiee blood.

02:57.244 --> 02:58.577
You said
you never saw  <i>Star Wars.</i>

02:58.579 --> 02:59.945
I never did,
and I never will.

02:59.947 --> 03:03.615
Are you crazy? That movie was the best
thing in my childhood.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.717
Well, it was
the worst thing about mine.

03:06.253 --> 03:09.087
When I was a child, everyone
pretended to be my friend

03:09.089 --> 03:11.657
just so they could meet
a walking carpet.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.725
Kids can be so cruel.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.894
Can we do dinner
with your uncle tonight?

03:16.596 --> 03:19.364
Molly. It'll be my treat.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.767
Dude, it's just
a guy in a suit.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.001
You're a guy in a suit.

03:23.003 --> 03:23.902
Why are you doing this, man?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.103
Dude, 'cause I'm scary
like that...

03:25.105 --> 03:28.674
Shutty. Look who just
found the Wook-napper.

03:30.443 --> 03:32.311
His name is Bobby Fettman.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.746
They call him
the Bounty Hunter.

03:34.748 --> 03:35.681
The Bounty Hunter?

03:35.683 --> 03:37.649
Legend has it
he has a subterranean bunker

03:37.651 --> 03:39.484
with all top collectibles.
It's nerd-vana.

03:39.486 --> 03:44.523
It makes no sense. Why would he post
pictures of himself in the stolen suit?

03:44.525 --> 03:45.691
You don't get it! Okay?

03:45.693 --> 03:49.828
This is the Chewie suit.
Original silky yak hair.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.930
If you slip it on,
you gotta show it off.

03:51.932 --> 03:55.200
I'm glad you speak his language,
but this punk is going down.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.602
The only thing,
it's gotta be on the DL.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.203
Veronica cannot
know about it.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.572
Why? Because this $2 million
gives me enough

04:00.574 --> 04:04.710
to exercise a buyback clause
in my contract with OCP.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.545
It's time, kiddies.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.847
We are getting
the company back.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.317
Oh, yeah.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.936
<i>â™ª We got your back</i>

04:32.071 --> 04:33.272
Okay, boys,
I bought us some time.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.340
I challenged Vee and Creepy C
that they couldn't

04:35.342 --> 04:37.109
play  <i>Chopsticks</i>
<i>without screwing it up.</i>

04:38.545 --> 04:42.948
Dun, dun, dun. Dun, dun, dun, dun.
Carol!

04:42.950 --> 04:44.149
Sorry!
I don't know this song!

04:44.151 --> 04:46.218
I said an "E,"
not a "C" sharp!

04:46.220 --> 04:48.453
Your hammer toe is getting
in the way of your dancing!

04:48.455 --> 04:49.621
Sounds like
we got about an hour.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.722
What's the skinny
on Fettman?

04:50.724 --> 04:52.291
Did a little digging
and found our in.

04:52.293 --> 04:55.527
Fettman spends all his time at this
seedy bar in the valley,

04:55.529 --> 04:56.295
trying to pick up girls,

04:56.297 --> 04:58.130
and he's got
a very specific type.

04:58.132 --> 05:01.300
There's a striking
resemblance to...

05:02.035 --> 05:02.467
Veronica!

05:02.469 --> 05:04.703
Hey, it's really
sounding great, you two.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.139
Uh, Vee, would you mind
helping us out with a little job-ski?

05:07.141 --> 05:10.642
No way. Not until
Carol and I nail this.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.978
I need you to
seduce a billionaire.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.013
Bye, Carol.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.462
Man. This place
looks kind of rough.

05:30.464 --> 05:34.966
You will never find a more wretched
hive of scum and villainy.

05:34.968 --> 05:35.767
I've been to worse.

05:35.769 --> 05:36.635
At least this place
doesn't have

05:36.637 --> 05:38.103
a concrete floor
with a drain in the middle.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.239
Okay, I have eyes on Fettman.
He's in the back booth.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.107
Let's rock 'n' roll.

05:42.109 --> 05:46.211
We get that phone, we hack into his life.
You ready, Vee?

05:46.213 --> 05:48.447
Yeah, we're ready.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.785
Oops.

05:53.886 --> 05:55.887
You dropped your purse.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.389
Oh. Why, thank you, sir.

05:57.391 --> 06:00.192
Do you want to sit down?
Of course.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.861
I'm Bobby Fettman.
Can I buy you a libation?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.429
I'm Blanche Deveraux.

06:04.431 --> 06:09.568
Just a moist Southern peach
waiting to be plucked.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.404
Hello there, beautiful.
Can I buy you a drink?

06:12.406 --> 06:14.973
Oh. Can't you see
the lady is with someone?

06:14.975 --> 06:18.243
Oh, why,
two gentleman callers?

06:18.245 --> 06:22.314
Are you boys gonna fight
over little ol' me?

06:22.715 --> 06:23.315
Nah. You know what?

06:23.317 --> 06:27.652
On, uh, closer inspection,
she's all yours.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.622
I swiped his cell phone.
Chop chop, Cam.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.324
It's only a matter of time
before he finds out

06:32.326 --> 06:35.093
about the phone
and the phony accent.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.196
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Okay.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.198
Downloaded. Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.934
This is what I look like
when I bounce.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.903
You're really
good at it, too.

06:46.806 --> 06:47.939
Ohh.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.308
Okay. Thanks for the drink.
I'm out of here.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.243
Wait, but you
laugh so good.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.744
Hey, can I just buy you
some expensive things

06:52.746 --> 06:55.347
sometime, um, if you like
that sort of thing?

06:55.349 --> 06:59.251
Well, I suppose I could

06:59.253 --> 07:01.520
dally.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.025
He doesn't like you.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.460
I'm... Sorry?

07:08.462 --> 07:10.495
I don't like you, either.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.397
This is not the dork
you're looking for.

07:12.399 --> 07:15.033
This is not the dork
we're looking for.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.668
Go back to your drinks.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.637
Let's go back to our drinks.

07:19.872 --> 07:22.107
Let's hit it, kid.

07:26.913 --> 07:29.281
Hey, Oz, thanks for
saving my ass last night

07:29.283 --> 07:31.650
with some kind of
freaky mind control.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.752
"Mind control?"
Don't be ridiculous.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.020
They just saw
the butt of my Glock,

07:35.022 --> 07:36.655
but you should know
that once I get Contra back,

07:36.657 --> 07:38.523
I'm not always gonna be
around to protect you.

07:38.525 --> 07:39.791
Why? Where are
you gonna be?

07:39.793 --> 07:43.428
Uh, drumming up business,
hanging with sheiks,

07:43.430 --> 07:46.665
backing military coups,
general globe-trotter-y.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.567
Once I'm gone,
you are gonna be the guy

07:48.569 --> 07:50.936
sitting in that Kirk chair,
running the ship.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.304
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not a captain.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.805
I'm like the guy
in the red shirt

07:53.807 --> 07:56.508
that stands in the corner,
that nobody bothers.

07:56.510 --> 07:59.177
Yeah, but that guy dies.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.680
Let's go see what you got
off Fettman's phone. Come on.

08:01.682 --> 08:05.550
Fettman had everything
on his phone, alarm codes, passwords,

08:05.552 --> 08:07.886
including schematics
and blueprints for his home.

08:07.888 --> 08:11.189
Wow. You mean he built
his very own Death Star?

08:11.191 --> 08:12.524
Really? That's so...

08:12.526 --> 08:13.291
Awesome!

08:13.293 --> 08:14.993
Well,
I was gonna say silly.

08:14.995 --> 08:15.694
This is so badass.

08:15.696 --> 08:16.895
I bet you he had
little cleaning droids

08:16.897 --> 08:18.997
that went around
and vacuumed the whole joint.

08:18.999 --> 08:19.631
You mean a Roomba?

08:19.633 --> 08:21.967
A Roomba? George Lucas
thought of it first.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.635
Well, if you want
to get technical,

08:23.637 --> 08:24.436
it was actually the Jetsons.

08:24.438 --> 08:26.638
That's the future. This was a long,
long time ago.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.808
Like, how long? Like, a long time ago.
Eons.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.476
But, like, in years?
I'm just confused.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.477
I'm trying to tell you, dude,

08:32.479 --> 08:34.880
an eon was, like,
billions of years ago, dude.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.515
But in time, like,
what, is there dates?

08:36.517 --> 08:38.383
You're acting like a bitch right now.
Ohh...

08:38.385 --> 08:40.785
Cam? Stop provoking him.
Cash, stop being you.

08:40.787 --> 08:43.755
Gentlemen, it is,
after all, just a film.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.090
That cuts deep.

08:45.092 --> 08:48.793
Um, I got a phone message
from a "Bobby Fettman."

08:48.795 --> 08:49.327
Fettman?

08:49.329 --> 08:52.864
It says, "Know what
you're planning, I do. Fail, you will.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.065
"Suck it, you must."

08:54.067 --> 08:55.901
He's either foreign
or dyslexic.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.702
He's neither.
You read it like this.

08:57.704 --> 09:01.840
Mmm. "Fail, you will.
Suck it, you must."

09:01.842 --> 09:05.544
Oh, a stroke.
My grandmother had one of those.

09:05.546 --> 09:06.177
She's always like,

09:06.179 --> 09:09.381
"Wash my feet, you will."

09:09.383 --> 09:12.984
Fettman knows
what we're planning? How?

09:15.289 --> 09:16.588
Well, what was I
supposed to do?

09:16.590 --> 09:18.823
He bribed me
with shoes and orgasms!

09:18.825 --> 09:22.661
I was loud and clear. I said,
distract the man. That's it!

09:22.663 --> 09:26.731
And I did, three times.
Well, two and a half.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.667
His lightsaber misfired
this morning.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.102
Whoa. Whoa.
You went to his house?

09:31.104 --> 09:34.506
Oh, my. Look at this thing.

09:34.508 --> 09:39.244
Reminds me of my second husband.
He was Armenian.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.514
This is my most recent
and prized acquisition.

09:42.516 --> 09:43.114
Oh.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.883
It's the original
Chewbacca suit.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.651
Oh, is this the thing

09:46.653 --> 09:50.956
everybody's been trying
to steal back from you?

09:51.757 --> 09:53.959
Who's "everyone?"

09:54.026 --> 09:57.128
Come on. Forget about it.
It's just one job.

09:57.130 --> 10:00.565
No, no, it's not just
one job. It's the job.

10:00.567 --> 10:01.800
This is the one
that was gonna get me

10:01.802 --> 10:04.069
enough money
to buy the company back.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.805
Oh, my God.
That would be fantastic.

10:06.807 --> 10:07.572
Then we could be partners!

10:07.574 --> 10:11.643
Let me put this to you in the
quickest way I possibly can.

10:11.645 --> 10:12.877
Never!

10:12.879 --> 10:13.778
Whoa. Heh.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.714
Maybe I'm reading into this,
but that almost

10:15.716 --> 10:19.184
kind of sounds like you want
to get rid of me.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.194
Okay.
I'm in the Fettman compound.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.496
Oh, he knew we were
coming, all right.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.998
There's unfriendlies
everywhere.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.566
Oz, what are we gonna do?

10:36.036 --> 10:37.669
Oz? You copy?

10:37.671 --> 10:39.304
<i>Oh, he copies.</i>

10:39.306 --> 10:41.272
He just can't respond.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.341
Why don't you just go on home,
and nobody gets hurt?

10:43.343 --> 10:44.442
<i>All right, Fettman,</i>
<i>listen up.</i>

10:44.444 --> 10:46.478
You screw with my boss,
you screw with me.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.545
You're gonna feel the force.

10:47.547 --> 10:50.682
The force of my foot
in your ass!

10:50.684 --> 10:53.351
Bring it. I'll be waiting.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.787
Still want this?
Can you not take this back

10:55.789 --> 10:57.188
because your arms
are being held?

10:57.190 --> 10:59.391
I'm sorry.
I'll keep it then.

11:00.092 --> 11:00.692
All right, guys.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.627
He's got our boss
and a $2-million monkey suit,

11:02.629 --> 11:04.562
and we're not leaving
without both of them.

11:04.564 --> 11:05.263
But there's no way in.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.765
We can go in through
the thermal exhaust port.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.932
Dude, there's
no way he's leaving

11:07.934 --> 11:11.036
a totally vulnerable gaping hole
that leads into this compound.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.504
Dude, the exhaust port's
right there.

11:12.506 --> 11:16.608
See? He made
a perfect Death Star.

11:16.610 --> 11:18.209
What's a Death Star?

11:19.145 --> 11:20.311
Am I too late?

11:20.313 --> 11:21.179
What are you doing here?

11:21.181 --> 11:23.682
What do you mean?
I'm here to help fix this mess.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.750
It's not fixable.
Let's just call the authorities.

11:25.752 --> 11:28.219
No, we can't. We're the ones
breaking into his place.

11:28.221 --> 11:31.156
Vee's the only one that's been
on the inside. We need her.

11:31.158 --> 11:34.259
You're really
gonna let her come?

11:35.661 --> 11:37.295
I'll allow it.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.804
Told you they had
cleaning droids.

11:45.806 --> 11:46.638
Also known as Roombas.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.540
Shh! Come on. This way.

11:48.542 --> 11:52.811
How do you know? All these
corridors look exactly the same.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.579
Fettman gave me
a tour of his place

11:54.581 --> 11:58.817
right before I gave him
a tour of... My place.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.386
Yeah.
We made out over there.

12:01.388 --> 12:05.623
Skinned my knee back there.
Oh! Look, it's my lucky undies.

12:05.625 --> 12:09.027
It's like a trail
of slutty bread crumbs.

12:09.995 --> 12:11.563
Okay. This is it.

12:11.565 --> 12:15.033
This is where he keeps
his chalupa costume.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.367
It's Chewba...

12:16.369 --> 12:17.902
I'm surrounded by ignorance!

12:17.904 --> 12:20.138
Someone's coming.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.575
Took me eight years of construction
to build this place.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.644
Well, your neighbors
must have been delighted.

12:26.646 --> 12:29.214
Be honest. The pad is
pretty stellar, right?

12:29.216 --> 12:29.914
Reeks of desperation.

12:29.916 --> 12:33.852
Desperate? Please. You see that
babe I brought home last night?

12:33.854 --> 12:35.587
Yeah, I did. Did you?

12:35.589 --> 12:38.223
<i>Gonk. Gonk, gonk. Gonk, gonk.</i>

12:38.225 --> 12:40.125
<i>Gonk, gonk. Gonk, gonk. Gonk.</i>

12:40.127 --> 12:46.131
<i>Run away. Run away. Run away.</i>
<i>Run away. Run away. Run away.</i>

12:46.298 --> 12:49.267
Okay. You guys get the suit.
I'm gonna rescue Oz.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.435
No. That's a bad idea.

12:50.437 --> 12:54.005
He's flanked by Imperial guards.
That's eight against one.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.040
Never tell me the odds.

12:56.642 --> 12:59.744
What now?
Now we go inside.

12:59.879 --> 13:02.914
I know the code. I saw him
punch it in last night.

13:02.916 --> 13:06.751
I remembered it because
it's the year I was born, 1983.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.695
Holy Grail!

13:17.697 --> 13:20.965
Just kill me
and bury me here.

13:23.202 --> 13:25.804
It's so beautiful.

13:26.438 --> 13:27.872
Oh, my...

13:31.912 --> 13:35.580
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

13:35.582 --> 13:37.081
Ooh. Yoda. Ooh.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.017
Jabba!

13:39.553 --> 13:40.852
Look, Molly, look!

13:40.854 --> 13:44.088
There it is,
my uncle's fuzzy suit.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.494
It's a trap!

13:49.496 --> 13:51.729
We gotta get out of here!
Take that off!

13:51.731 --> 13:55.166
No, he's got, like, 20 of 'em.
He's not gonna miss one.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.135
What the hell are you doing?

13:57.137 --> 14:00.038
Well, somebody's
gotta save our skins.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.674
Quick. Into the air vent.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.343
Whoo!
Ladies first. Go.

14:06.011 --> 14:09.080
Bottoms up. Whee! Aah.

14:12.919 --> 14:15.119
Ohh! Aah!

14:16.121 --> 14:17.622
Oh, Cash.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.290
Uhh! I'm gonna try the door.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.525
Oh!

14:20.527 --> 14:22.794
It's locked!

14:22.962 --> 14:24.696
I got a bad feeling
about this.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.731
Oh, my goodness!
It smells like feet!

14:26.733 --> 14:29.234
Something just moved
past my leg! Oh, God!

14:29.236 --> 14:31.870
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God.
Aah! Aah! Aah!

14:31.872 --> 14:34.339
Oh, it's a garden hose.
We're good.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.677
What's happening?

14:39.679 --> 14:40.411
We're in a trash compactor!

14:40.413 --> 14:42.313
We're gonna be
squished to death!

14:42.315 --> 14:42.981
And it's awesome!

14:42.983 --> 14:46.084
But it's incredibly terrifying!
But it's awesome!

14:46.086 --> 14:50.755
This is why I hate <i>Star Wars,</i>
<i>because we're all going to die.</i>

14:50.757 --> 14:52.724
But I've never lived!

14:52.726 --> 14:53.591
Well, one thing's for sure,

14:53.593 --> 14:54.792
we're all gonna be
a lot thinner.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.327
Well, that doesn't
sound so bad!

14:56.329 --> 14:59.230
Cameron, get us
out of here! Cam!

14:59.365 --> 15:00.999
Aah!

15:11.343 --> 15:12.777
Cameron! Cameron!

15:12.779 --> 15:15.346
<i>Cameron! Where could he be?</i>

15:20.419 --> 15:22.487
Ow!

15:24.724 --> 15:26.557
Ow. Ow.

15:26.892 --> 15:29.027
You're beaten.
It's pointless to resist.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.529
What the hell, man?
Did you just tase me in the ass?

15:31.531 --> 15:34.465
This isn't a taser.
This is a lightsaber prototype.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.100
I spent decades developing it.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.002
It's basically
a high-powered cattle prod.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.707
Ow, ow! Ow! Come on!
I'm not a cow, dude!

15:42.709 --> 15:43.975
Ow!

15:43.977 --> 15:45.977
I know that girlie scream!
That's Cam!

15:45.979 --> 15:49.480
Cam! We're down here!
Help us!

15:49.482 --> 15:50.281
Cameron! Cameron!

15:50.283 --> 15:52.784
Shut down the trash compactor
on the basement level!

15:52.786 --> 15:55.086
Shut down the trash compactor
on the basement level!

15:55.088 --> 15:58.222
What are they doing
in the trash compactor?

15:58.224 --> 16:00.858
They could get seriously
injured down there.

16:00.860 --> 16:04.128
Oh. Oh, this is vile. Vile!

16:06.333 --> 16:08.099
Yes! Whoo!
Oh, my God!

16:08.101 --> 16:10.034
Oh! Oh!
Yes! Yes, buddy, yes!

16:10.036 --> 16:13.705
Cameron, yeah! Oh, you're
a lifesaver! Oh, my God!

16:13.707 --> 16:14.772
You're welcome.

16:14.774 --> 16:18.109
All right. Glad to know
we can all behave like normal people.

16:18.111 --> 16:22.413
Ow! Come... That is it.
You are going down.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.582
You are going down.
I'm just...

16:24.584 --> 16:26.584
How do you turn...
Is there, like, a button?

16:26.586 --> 16:27.952
It's not a baton, you moron.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.087
Like, maybe a slide-y thing?
I thought...

16:29.089 --> 16:30.722
Push the... No.
You see, it slides... Oh.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.824
You see... See that?
Yeah... Oh, thank you.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.693
You're welcome.
All right. Let's do this.

16:53.445 --> 16:54.812
No.

17:04.390 --> 17:07.058
Let me give you
a hand with that.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.999
One more step,
and I fry his eggs!

17:15.001 --> 17:16.634
Cameron, don't do it.

17:17.469 --> 17:18.369
I am your father.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.370
Dude, we're, like,
the same age.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.639
I know, but, in all seriousness,
I'm your brother.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.642
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.611
Fist of fury coming through.

17:28.847 --> 17:29.714
You're all clear, kid.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.449
Let's blow this thing
and go home.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.817
You thought
it was gonna be that easy?

17:32.819 --> 17:35.019
I saved the baddest-ass
for last.

17:35.021 --> 17:37.822
Shadoobie.

17:51.870 --> 17:52.236
Todd?

17:52.238 --> 17:55.840
Oz. Haven't seen you
since the KGB.

17:55.842 --> 17:56.808
What?

17:56.810 --> 17:57.875
Sorry about all this.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.110
Just doing a bit
of freelance.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.679
Hey, I totally get it, man.
Times are tough.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.515
Seriously?
You even know the guards?

18:04.517 --> 18:07.385
Were we ever even in danger?

18:07.519 --> 18:08.453
Nah.

18:08.455 --> 18:12.356
But you passed the test.
Told you, you were a leader.

18:12.358 --> 18:13.357
Friendship and loyalty.

18:13.359 --> 18:16.661
That's the true force
that binds the galaxy together.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.830
Uh, why don't you guys
just kiss already

18:18.832 --> 18:21.499
and get the hell
out of my house?

18:21.934 --> 18:24.669
And you're fired.
Oh, you're fired.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.904
Suck it. Let's go.

18:31.477 --> 18:32.243
Thank you, Oz.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.045
As promised,
your payment,

18:34.047 --> 18:36.914
but perhaps, since we all
had such a lovely adventure,

18:36.916 --> 18:39.250
we could just call it
a pro bono.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.487
Deposited.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.255
Excellent.

18:48.927 --> 18:50.628
Why, you stuck-up,

18:50.630 --> 18:55.333
half-witted, scruffy-looking
nerd... Nerf herder.

18:55.335 --> 18:59.337
"Nerf herder?"
Slave Leia updo?

18:59.605 --> 19:01.405
For the love of Lucas,
you know stuff.

19:01.407 --> 19:04.475
Well, I thought,
after this whole ordeal,

19:04.477 --> 19:06.210
I'd finally watch the  <i>Wars.</i>

19:06.212 --> 19:07.578
Oh, you watched my remake?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.647
<i>He told me</i>
<i>you killed him!</i>

19:09.649 --> 19:13.117
<i>No. I am your father.</i>

19:13.119 --> 19:15.419
<i>No!</i>

19:16.688 --> 19:17.421
It was just so romantic.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.924
I was rooting for Luke and Leia
to get together

19:19.926 --> 19:21.526
right from the beginning...
Well, I mean,

19:21.528 --> 19:23.961
right up until you realize
that she was his sister.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.931
And then those cute little
Care Bears in the forest...

19:26.933 --> 19:29.167
Ewoks,
but we'll get there.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.502
Have you watched
the prequels yet?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.638
No. I was thinking,
you know,

19:33.640 --> 19:36.841
heh, maybe we could
watch 'em together.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.842
Oh.
<i>Menace</i> is underrated,

19:37.844 --> 19:40.144
but  <i>Sith</i> totally deepens
the legend of Vader.

19:40.146 --> 19:43.514
Okay, that all sort of...
for me, but,

19:43.516 --> 19:45.383
well, I'm game if you are.

19:47.653 --> 19:50.421
I love you.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.990
I know.

20:44.877 --> 20:48.279
I guess this is good-bye,
huh, Oz?

20:48.281 --> 20:49.914
You don't want this?

20:49.916 --> 20:52.350
You... You want me to stay?

20:52.985 --> 20:56.787
I can't believe I'm actually gonna say
these words,

20:56.789 --> 20:58.456
but, uh,

20:59.124 --> 21:00.791
I'll allow it.

21:03.862 --> 21:06.597
How come I didn't
get a medal?

21:06.599 --> 21:11.535
I got your medal right here,
brother. Face!

21:12.304 --> 21:14.338
Whoo! Guess who's back?

21:14.340 --> 21:16.040
Did we win, like, a track meet
or something?

21:16.042 --> 21:19.343
I don't know, man.
This place is weird.
