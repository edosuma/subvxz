00:33.894 --> 00:35.386
Hee hee hee hee.

00:35.454 --> 00:38.980
Oh, man, these things
are gonna make me rich.

00:39.964 --> 00:42.738
It's like a big yarmulke
for the tummy.

00:43.870 --> 00:45.061
Mm.

00:45.136 --> 00:47.831
I think I'll keep this one
for myself.

00:49.886 --> 00:53.308
Hoyt coiture!
Hmm.

00:55.706 --> 00:57.074
Nice.

00:57.229 --> 00:59.948
Ooh, little roomy.
When did that happen?

01:00.191 --> 01:02.214
I am wasting away.

01:02.331 --> 01:06.011
I should probably go polish off
that cheesecake in the fridge.

Hmm.

01:23.569 --> 01:24.869
Oh.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.808
Now, what are you guys up to?

01:33.488 --> 01:35.659
Ah, here's my man, Gunther.

01:35.847 --> 01:38.011
You're hanging with
a bad crowd, goontz.

01:38.081 --> 01:41.136
All right, guys, just let me
rescue my cheesecake

01:41.206 --> 01:42.853
and my goontz.

01:42.921 --> 01:44.284
Come on.

01:44.413 --> 01:46.394
Oh, there you are.

01:49.792 --> 01:53.066
A little Gunther,
a little cheesecake...

01:54.113 --> 01:56.269
And a little fork.

01:57.628 --> 01:58.941
You know what, goonty?

01:59.016 --> 02:02.472
I am gonna take my time
with this delicious cake.

02:02.652 --> 02:05.917
Take it real slow.

02:10.058 --> 02:11.613
Mmm.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.918
Oh, getting full.

02:15.097 --> 02:17.574
All right, maybe just
another teeny corner.

02:17.745 --> 02:19.230
Mmm.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.827
What's wrong, Gunther?

02:24.034 --> 02:26.855
Does Gunther want
some cheesecake, too?

02:27.011 --> 02:28.831
No.

02:28.972 --> 02:33.196
Cheesecake is not for penguins,
silly Gunther.

02:33.296 --> 02:35.974
No, no.

02:38.806 --> 02:41.401
You win this round,
Mr. Cheesecake.

02:41.469 --> 02:44.739
I'll just clean up a few crumbs
and leave the rest for tomorrow.

02:44.816 --> 02:46.828
I've had enough for one day.

02:52.414 --> 02:54.235
Gunther!

02:58.860 --> 03:00.664
Oh, my little pal.

03:00.792 --> 03:03.735
Gunther, I love...

04:00.102 --> 04:01.409
That's so true.

04:01.477 --> 04:03.508
I am
the prettiest one here.

04:20.990 --> 04:22.896
Come on, number 5!

04:23.170 --> 04:26.450
Five on number 5 to win!
I feel lucky!

04:26.527 --> 04:28.852
Come on, number 5!

04:30.042 --> 04:31.375
What?

04:31.496 --> 04:34.176
I've got a lot of money riding
on you to win, you jerk!

04:34.527 --> 04:36.559
Come on, you slug!

04:36.629 --> 04:38.663
Ugly, dumb walrus!

04:39.026 --> 04:40.518
Aah!

04:40.807 --> 04:42.514
What did I do to deserve this?!

04:42.674 --> 04:44.526
Gunther!
Gunther, help!

04:44.619 --> 04:45.869
I'm your guest of honor!

04:45.946 --> 04:47.080
Gunther, help!

04:47.148 --> 04:50.634
I'm a princess, dummy!
Get your mouth off me!

04:54.913 --> 04:56.423
Gunther.

04:56.535 --> 04:58.703
Don't touch my stomach.

05:28.292 --> 05:29.980
Ahhhh.

07:13.903 --> 07:16.356
The signal!
The signal!

07:16.512 --> 07:18.897
We haven't had a communication
from Orgalorg

07:18.981 --> 07:20.176
in thousands of years!

07:20.262 --> 07:22.780
He must be mad at us!
Everybody kneel!

07:22.848 --> 07:24.723
Everybody kneel!

07:24.840 --> 07:26.653
Better do
as he says, kids.

07:26.786 --> 07:28.569
Mommy, who's Orgalorg?

07:28.637 --> 07:30.558
Oh, well, uh...

07:30.635 --> 07:33.887
Um... to be honest,
we thought he was just a myth

07:33.965 --> 07:35.733
our stupid grandparents
told us

07:35.801 --> 07:36.872
so we wouldn't make out.

07:36.940 --> 07:39.598
Yes.
And you should have listened.

07:41.051 --> 07:42.376
The elders.

07:42.444 --> 07:44.309
Yes, the elders.

07:46.198 --> 07:47.684
The elders!

07:48.317 --> 07:53.489
We told you Orgalorg
is real and horrifying.

07:53.692 --> 07:55.392
But nobody would listen.

07:55.559 --> 07:58.348
You all just wanted
to make out.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.155
Uh, well,
we're listening now.

08:00.223 --> 08:02.809
After you had kids and they
didn't want to listen to you,

08:02.895 --> 08:04.442
how did that make you feel?

08:04.543 --> 08:06.833
- Terrible.
- Exactly.

08:06.905 --> 08:09.273
Anyway, so, make-outs.

08:09.418 --> 08:12.137
Orgalorg.
Oh. Orgalorg.

08:12.299 --> 08:16.083
Orgalorg is an ancient
cosmic entity

08:16.465 --> 08:21.051
who ruled the solar system with
his cruel and deadly whims.

08:21.184 --> 08:23.426
The breaker of worlds.

08:23.715 --> 08:25.965
He was seeking ever more power.

08:26.122 --> 08:29.192
He desired to intercept
a catalyst comet

08:29.269 --> 08:31.452
and absorb its essence.

08:31.606 --> 08:34.188
Thereby did he offend
the king of mars,

08:34.274 --> 08:37.308
who decreed that Orgalorg
should be cast down.

08:37.376 --> 08:39.511
And yes, he was cast down

08:39.621 --> 08:42.563
by the flaming sword
of grob gob glob grod.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.509
Orgalorg was banished
to an inhospitable planet,

08:45.578 --> 08:47.773
where he would forget
everything.

08:47.875 --> 08:53.289
Yea, even forget his identity
and from whence he came.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.760
And the prophets say that
the gravity of the planet

08:57.828 --> 09:00.348
did crush
and compress Orgalorg

09:00.425 --> 09:04.227
into a more powerless
and cuddlesome form.

09:04.304 --> 09:05.909
Ooh!

09:05.977 --> 09:09.102
But now he's back,
and whose fault is that?

09:09.219 --> 09:10.594
Make-outs.

09:10.687 --> 09:13.055
Behold! It is he!

09:13.166 --> 09:15.977
Orgalorg reaches out
from the void!

09:31.258 --> 09:32.446
Huh?

09:33.211 --> 09:34.591
Gunther?

10:31.319 --> 10:32.881
Gunther!

10:33.155 --> 10:35.540
That's a bad boy, Gunther.

10:35.608 --> 10:37.772
You wrecked
daddy's stuff again.

10:39.569 --> 10:42.045
Son, your stuffing's
peeking out.

10:43.841 --> 10:46.295
Okay, Gunther,
let's just...

10:46.506 --> 10:48.899
Boop. Beep.

10:48.976 --> 10:51.535
Bip. Bop.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.202
And a bandage.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.332
See?

10:58.409 --> 11:01.249
You're practically back
to normal, my little goontz.

11:01.332 --> 11:03.522
Here, take a look
for yourself.

11:03.905 --> 11:05.709
Not bad, eh, goonty?

11:05.834 --> 11:07.987
Not bad at all.
