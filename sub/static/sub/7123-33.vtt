00:39.239 --> 00:40.467
Oh!

00:40.540 --> 00:42.030
Ha ha! I win!

00:42.108 --> 00:43.370
Oh. Hey, man.

00:43.443 --> 00:45.434
You and BMO play
finger spread quietly.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.571
I need to get into the zone.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.141
I am ready to
receive instruction

00:52.218 --> 00:54.277
from the realm of
creation above me

00:54.354 --> 00:56.948
for the sandwich I am
about to conceive.

00:57.023 --> 00:58.183
I am open.

00:58.258 --> 00:59.486
Use me.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.736
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.366
Rosemary, thyme.

01:17.944 --> 01:19.070
Sous-vide.

01:19.145 --> 01:21.079
Keep that at 135 degrees.

01:26.453 --> 01:28.683
All right, now we're
getting somewhere.

01:28.755 --> 01:29.915
Cream cheese...

01:29.989 --> 01:31.513
pickles from my boy Prismo...

01:31.591 --> 01:32.591
and some dill!

01:34.294 --> 01:36.159
Diced boiled eggs!

01:36.229 --> 01:37.526
Bird from the window!

01:37.597 --> 01:39.565
Yeah, baby, now we're rolling!

01:39.632 --> 01:40.690
Whoo!

01:40.767 --> 01:41.961
Common cucumber!

01:42.035 --> 01:43.366
Sliced roma tomato.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.700
Sweet yellow onion, organic.

01:47.841 --> 01:48.739
Almost done.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.070
Tears for salt.

01:50.143 --> 01:51.701
Meat prepared sous-vide.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.040
Bacon.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.412
You're the most important part.

01:59.886 --> 02:01.717
Lobster soul.

02:04.724 --> 02:06.248
It's amazing.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.317
Ohh-oh.

02:08.394 --> 02:11.158
This is the greatest
sandwich I've ever made.

02:11.231 --> 02:12.323
Is it glowing?

02:14.334 --> 02:15.494
You guys want some?

02:15.568 --> 02:16.592
It's cool, man.

02:16.669 --> 02:18.114
I know you want to
eat the whole thing,

02:18.138 --> 02:19.138
and I'm cool with that.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.433
Thank you.

02:23.243 --> 02:24.403
Magic Man!

02:24.477 --> 02:25.569
Magic Dog!

02:25.645 --> 02:27.135
I'll take some sandwich.

02:27.213 --> 02:28.475
You stay away from my woman...

02:28.548 --> 02:30.038
eh, my sandwich!

02:30.116 --> 02:32.550
Hmm, yeah, I <i>could</i> do that.

02:32.619 --> 02:33.677
Or...

02:33.753 --> 02:34.811
wait.

02:34.888 --> 02:35.980
Wait.

02:38.224 --> 02:39.589
Sandwiche!

02:39.659 --> 02:40.489
Mijo!

02:40.560 --> 02:41.390
Magic Man!

02:41.461 --> 02:42.461
My sandwich!

02:42.529 --> 02:44.326
That's a good-looking sandwich.

02:44.397 --> 02:45.541
What are you gonna do with it?

02:45.565 --> 02:46.896
Something gross?

02:48.801 --> 02:50.666
It's got my germs,
so it's mine now.

02:50.737 --> 02:53.205
N-o-o-o-o-o!

02:53.273 --> 02:54.900
Dead arms!

02:57.443 --> 02:59.377
Give it back, you animal!

02:59.445 --> 03:01.913
Look, if you really
want your sandwich,

03:01.981 --> 03:04.245
you'll have to solve
my little riddle.

03:04.317 --> 03:06.080
Unh!

03:06.152 --> 03:10.111
When your face shows 7:20,
when green leaves turn brown,

03:10.190 --> 03:13.785
the only way forward is down.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.454
Then you'll see, the
wetter, the better.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.053
That's not even a riddle.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.723
It's word play, at best!

03:19.799 --> 03:21.243
You try and come up with
something on the spot!

03:21.267 --> 03:22.267
It's hard!

03:23.169 --> 03:24.169
Aah!

03:24.237 --> 03:25.966
Now to savor the moment.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.437
It's just you and me, baby.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.280
What the...

03:35.348 --> 03:36.474
Jake, wait!

03:39.819 --> 03:40.945
What's he doin' in there?

03:41.020 --> 03:42.988
Why did he freeze himself
with my sandwich?

03:43.056 --> 03:43.988
He's not frozen.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.684
He's super-slow-mozen, motion.

03:45.758 --> 03:49.854
Look.

03:49.929 --> 03:52.090
Aw! That's gross!

03:52.165 --> 03:54.326
Well, let's go grab it
before he hits the ground,

03:54.400 --> 03:56.129
which is when I assume
he'll take a bite.

03:56.202 --> 03:57.202
Yeah, okay.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.328
Hmm.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.403
Feels like cold spaghetti.

04:07.046 --> 04:10.777
Oh... hey, Jake.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.374
Hey, Finn.

04:14.988 --> 04:19.789
How... long... have... we...
been... in... here?

04:19.858 --> 04:23.955
I... don't... know.

04:25.465 --> 04:29.629
Retre-e-a-at!

04:36.709 --> 04:37.539
Whoa.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.508
How long were we in there?

04:38.578 --> 04:39.408
Five hours.

04:39.479 --> 04:40.810
Five hours?!

04:45.752 --> 04:47.344
He's halfway to
hittin' the ground!

04:47.420 --> 04:49.388
Which is when he'll bite
my sandwich, probably.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.455
Yes.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.451
BMO!

04:52.525 --> 04:55.153
I agree that is when he
will probably take a bite.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.388
You're not helping.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.895
Oh. You need help?

04:57.964 --> 04:58.896
I can help.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.159
Processing.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.757
Must be his new software.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.961
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:04.037 --> 05:04.935
Ding!

05:05.004 --> 05:06.665
I have the solution, Jake.

05:06.739 --> 05:07.569
What?!

05:07.640 --> 05:08.868
BMO, are you serious?

05:08.941 --> 05:10.806
Yes, this plan will work.

05:10.877 --> 05:11.741
Yes!

05:11.811 --> 05:12.641
But we have to hurry.

05:12.712 --> 05:13.542
Yes!

05:13.613 --> 05:14.613
All right, BMO!

05:28.227 --> 05:29.626
Wait, wait, wait.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.687
BMO, are you just making
a skateboard video?

05:31.764 --> 05:32.788
No, Finn.

05:32.865 --> 05:33.865
This is the plan.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.094
Are you sure?

05:35.168 --> 05:37.693
Jake, you will have your
sandwich back before

05:37.770 --> 05:39.294
my board hits the ground.

05:39.372 --> 05:40.600
Okay, BMO.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.436
Yay, BMO!

05:46.079 --> 05:48.411
This is s-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i...

05:48.481 --> 05:50.676
i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i...

05:50.750 --> 05:51.910
He lied to me.

05:51.984 --> 05:52.984
Relax.

05:53.052 --> 05:54.986
I'm calling Princess Bubblegum.

05:55.054 --> 05:56.385
It's ringing.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.686
Maybe I should just
make another one.

06:12.171 --> 06:13.069
Eh, okay.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.197
Let's do this.

06:14.273 --> 06:16.104
I can make another
awesome sandwich.

06:16.175 --> 06:19.906
Creation realm, inspire
me once again!

06:24.550 --> 06:26.142
Okay...

06:26.219 --> 06:27.429
Thanks again for
coming, Prubbles.

06:27.453 --> 06:28.715
Of course, Finn.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.951
Once you explained about
Jake's sandwich, I had to.

06:32.024 --> 06:33.582
So, how's it looking?

06:33.659 --> 06:35.889
I'm picking up
major levels here.

06:35.962 --> 06:36.962
Of magic?

06:37.029 --> 06:37.893
Molasses.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.397
Oh.

06:39.465 --> 06:42.866
He's using a molasses-based
supercovalent subatomic bond,

06:42.935 --> 06:45.426
slowing down anything
that enters its field,

06:45.505 --> 06:48.440
but only if the molasses
is at room temperature.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.169
Mm, this one.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.768
My molasses warmer will
get things moving.

07:05.158 --> 07:08.355
L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-I-I-I...

07:08.428 --> 07:09.895
Well, I'm out of ideas.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.524
Who are you calling?

07:12.598 --> 07:13.462
Marceline.

07:13.533 --> 07:14.591
The Vampire Queen?!

07:16.235 --> 07:17.327
Oh.

07:17.403 --> 07:18.461
Maybe...

07:18.538 --> 07:20.028
Maybe it's just as good!

07:22.842 --> 07:23.934
Blaagh!

07:24.010 --> 07:25.409
It's terrible!

07:25.478 --> 07:28.072
Dang you, Magic Man.

07:28.147 --> 07:30.445
You took my one and only!

07:36.823 --> 07:39.257
See, I think the molasses
must be protected by

07:39.325 --> 07:40.690
some sort of chemical...

07:40.760 --> 07:41.590
Oh, hey, Jake.

07:41.661 --> 07:42.559
How are you holding up?

07:42.628 --> 07:43.856
Not too well.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.591
BMO looks cool though.

07:45.665 --> 07:48.998
L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-I-I-I...

07:50.503 --> 07:51.561
Don't be sad.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.697
Yeah, Marceline's
got a great plan.

07:54.774 --> 07:55.968
Yeah, man!

07:56.042 --> 07:57.202
What's your plan?

07:57.276 --> 07:59.801
Demon juice!

07:59.879 --> 08:03.542
R-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!

08:03.616 --> 08:05.481
R-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a...

08:05.551 --> 08:08.213
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I...

08:11.390 --> 08:12.220
Hey, man.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.553
What are you doing?

08:13.626 --> 08:15.404
I'm lighting these candles
so I can move on with

08:15.428 --> 08:17.020
the grieving process.

08:17.096 --> 08:19.724
I made them with the leftover
bacon fat from my sand...

08:22.568 --> 08:23.933
I am not giving up.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.003
Let's see.

08:25.037 --> 08:25.901
Who should I call?

08:25.972 --> 08:26.972
Ice King? Shelby?

08:27.039 --> 08:27.869
Tree Trunks?

08:27.940 --> 08:28.998
Tree Trunks?!

08:29.075 --> 08:31.475
No, man, don't call Tree Trunks!

08:31.544 --> 08:32.442
What's she gonna do?!

08:32.511 --> 08:33.842
Bake an apple pie?!

08:33.913 --> 08:35.174
Don't you get it?!

08:35.248 --> 08:36.806
It's over.

08:36.883 --> 08:40.443
It's over, and I've
never been so sad.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.782
And you know what?

08:41.854 --> 08:43.344
I got to deal with it.

08:43.422 --> 08:44.422
Jake, look!

08:44.490 --> 08:45.889
Hmm?

08:45.958 --> 08:47.516
What? But how?

08:47.593 --> 08:49.356
Because you've never
been this sad!

08:49.428 --> 08:52.261
That's what magic man meant
by your face showing 7:20,

08:52.331 --> 08:54.765
or as some people
call it, a sad face.

08:54.834 --> 08:55.732
What?

08:55.801 --> 08:57.860
Nobody calls it th-a-a-a-a-at!

08:57.937 --> 08:58.767
Nope! No!

08:58.838 --> 08:59.930
Don't get judgmental.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.337
Stay sad.

09:01.407 --> 09:02.601
Right.

09:02.675 --> 09:06.270
Magic Man, I'm gonna
sock you in the head!

09:11.250 --> 09:13.718
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!

09:13.786 --> 09:15.777
Ha... ha... ha... ha... ha...

09:15.855 --> 09:18.050
Jake, every time you get
happy, you slow down!

09:18.124 --> 09:19.318
Stay sad, man!

09:19.392 --> 09:20.950
Make yourself sad!

09:21.027 --> 09:23.461
Uh... okay!

09:25.998 --> 09:27.932
J-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ake!

09:28.000 --> 09:29.331
It's okay, Lady.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.835
You got to let go.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.097
He's gone now.

09:32.171 --> 09:34.105
Let me take you
out for a coffee,

09:34.173 --> 09:36.334
get your mind off things.

09:45.651 --> 09:48.484
Hey, Lady, I'm here for you.

09:48.554 --> 09:50.488
Don't you ever forget that.

09:53.693 --> 09:55.957
Hey, Mr. Cupcake, you stay away...
from... Lady!

09:56.028 --> 09:56.858
No, man!

09:56.929 --> 09:57.861
Stay sad!

09:57.930 --> 09:59.693
Make yourself sad!

09:59.765 --> 10:01.756
Uh...

10:03.169 --> 10:05.034
I... I love you, Jake.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.469
We should have hung out more.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.631
What?

10:07.707 --> 10:10.767
Um, I love you too, Mr. Cupcake.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.868
I didn't want to hang
because I thought Lady

10:12.945 --> 10:14.276
was into your muscles.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.609
And I thought if we'd hung out,

10:15.681 --> 10:17.672
you'd sweet-talk her
and take her from me.

10:17.750 --> 10:18.750
What?

10:18.784 --> 10:20.081
I would never.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.086
I have got so much
respect for you.

10:22.154 --> 10:24.520
Dude, I have so much
respect for you.

10:24.590 --> 10:27.525
I try to be like you in
some aspects of my life.

10:27.593 --> 10:30.357
Look, if something
were to happen to me,

10:30.429 --> 10:31.896
and I wasn't here anymore,

10:31.964 --> 10:34.296

time together.

Me... too!
