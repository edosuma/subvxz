[instrumental music]

00:34.500 --> 00:37.500
[beeping]

01:00.667 --> 01:01.958
Delenn?

01:02.042 --> 01:03.583
(Delenn)
'Yes.'

01:03.667 --> 01:05.125
Are you alright?

01:05.208 --> 01:08.292
'Yes. I...I just remembered
I-I-I need some important'

01:08.375 --> 01:12.500
'papers from my quarters
for tomorrow's council meeting.'

01:12.583 --> 01:14.292
A-at this hour?

01:14.375 --> 01:15.875
'Um..'

01:15.958 --> 01:17.500
I wouldn't be able
to sleep anyway

01:17.583 --> 01:20.917
so I just want to make sure
I know where they are.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.625
- You're, you're sure?
- Yes.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.125
Go on back to sleep.
I'll be right back.

01:30.125 --> 01:32.250
[sighs]

01:32.333 --> 01:35.417
[instrumental music]

01:57.500 --> 01:59.167
Waiting for me?

01:59.250 --> 02:00.792
I don't think so.

02:00.875 --> 02:02.792
Just because you don't know me.

02:02.875 --> 02:05.292
I don't think I've seen you
around here before.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.375
Let me buy you a drink.

02:07.458 --> 02:09.208
No. Thank you.

02:10.292 --> 02:12.500
You sure have pretty eyes.

02:14.292 --> 02:17.833
I wonder what the rest of you
looks like underneath all that.

02:18.875 --> 02:20.958
Seems a shame to hide it.

02:23.792 --> 02:26.542
I will ask you politely
to go away.

02:26.625 --> 02:27.958
But I will only ask once.

02:28.042 --> 02:30.125
Good.
That'll save us time later.

02:30.208 --> 02:31.542
Look, hon.

02:31.625 --> 02:34.292
I'm here for the duration.
Get used to it.

02:34.375 --> 02:36.375
Whether you like it or not,
I'm the face you're going to be

02:36.458 --> 02:38.417
waking up to in the morning,
you got that?

02:44.167 --> 02:45.792
That's better.

02:48.333 --> 02:49.750
See?

02:51.833 --> 02:53.625
Yeah.

02:53.708 --> 02:54.750
[grunts]

02:54.833 --> 02:58.333
[groans]
Oh, God!

02:58.417 --> 03:00.375
You broke my finger!

03:00.458 --> 03:04.042
True, but you have nine others,
for the moment.

03:04.125 --> 03:06.125
[groaning]

03:08.167 --> 03:09.792
Get back here!

03:09.875 --> 03:12.125
[grunting]

03:27.083 --> 03:31.000
I was beginning to wonder if you
were going to make it, Lennier.

03:31.083 --> 03:32.792
I said that
I would never leave you..

03:32.875 --> 03:35.292
...that I would be here
when you needed me most.

03:35.375 --> 03:37.292
Tell me what you want done.
I will make it happen.

03:37.375 --> 03:39.292
No matter the cost.

03:45.542 --> 03:47.167
(male narrator)
And so it begins..

03:47.250 --> 03:49.792
- There is a hole in your mind.
- What do you want?

03:49.875 --> 03:51.792
(G'Kar)
No one here
is exactly what he appears.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.833
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

03:53.917 --> 03:55.958
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

03:56.042 --> 03:58.042
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn Homeworld?

03:58.125 --> 04:01.875
(Elric)
I see a great hand
reaching out of a star.

04:01.958 --> 04:04.375
(female #1)
President Clark has signed
a decree today declaring..

04:04.458 --> 04:07.583
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence.

04:07.667 --> 04:08.958
(Sheridan)
People get off their
encounter-suited

04:09.042 --> 04:10.208
butts and do something.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.833
(Zathras)
You're the one who was.

04:11.917 --> 04:14.500
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum,
you will die.

04:14.583 --> 04:16.000
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

04:16.083 --> 04:17.875
Do you have anything worth
living for?

04:17.958 --> 04:20.375
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful
city in flames.

04:20.458 --> 04:22.542
(Sheridan)
Now, get the hell out
of our galaxy!

04:22.625 --> 04:25.708
(Sheridan)
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

04:28.208 --> 04:31.250
[theme music]

05:01.250 --> 05:04.292
[music continues]

05:14.417 --> 05:16.958
[instrumental music]

05:19.458 --> 05:22.875
(Lennier)
Delenn, I don't understand
why you needed to see me

05:22.958 --> 05:24.708
alone down here.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.167
I could have met you
in your quarters

05:26.250 --> 05:27.417
or the council chambers--

05:27.500 --> 05:29.167
(Delenn)
Someone would have seen you

05:29.250 --> 05:30.625
and asked about you.

05:30.708 --> 05:31.958
We need to be discreet.

05:32.042 --> 05:34.500
I couldn't even risk
a coded transmission.

05:36.083 --> 05:38.083
Does Sheridan know?

05:38.167 --> 05:39.958
He's probably
the most important reason

05:40.042 --> 05:42.667
I'm keeping this meeting
just between us.

05:44.208 --> 05:45.500
Delenn.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.042
What is it you want
from me?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.375
Your help.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.625
Following a trip
to the Drazi Homeworld

05:54.708 --> 05:57.250
Mr. Garibaldi returned
with several compelling

05:57.333 --> 05:59.083
reasons to believe
that the Centauri

05:59.167 --> 06:01.625
are behind the recent attacks
against shipping lines

06:01.708 --> 06:04.333
used by the other
alliance worlds.

06:04.417 --> 06:06.083
Well, then, confront them.

06:06.167 --> 06:08.750
I said we had reason,
not proof.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.833
We can't go public
with what we suspect

06:10.917 --> 06:13.500
until we can prove
their involvement.

06:13.583 --> 06:15.583
Many of the rangers are
patrolling the shipping lines

06:15.667 --> 06:18.250
in this area, but none of them
have the experience

06:18.333 --> 06:20.958
with the Centauri
that you and I have.

06:21.042 --> 06:23.583
So, I need you..

06:23.667 --> 06:25.625
...on patrol, along
the Centauri border

06:25.708 --> 06:28.125
watching for anything
suspicious.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.792
You know how they think,
how they fight.

06:30.875 --> 06:33.958
If anyone can get the evidence
we need, it's you.

06:37.042 --> 06:39.458
But why not tell Sheridan?

06:42.375 --> 06:44.000
Since the death of Marcus..

06:45.042 --> 06:47.792
...and given the danger
involved..

06:47.875 --> 06:50.125
I think John would be reluctant
to send someone close to me

06:50.208 --> 06:51.708
on a mission like this.

06:53.375 --> 06:55.625
As a friend,
he would want to protect you.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.917
As my husband,
he would need to protect me

06:58.042 --> 07:00.417
from anything that
might happen to you.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.667
I think, in that respect..

07:02.750 --> 07:05.000
...he does not know you
as well as he should.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.750
He knows me.

07:06.833 --> 07:08.833
But he also loves me.

07:08.917 --> 07:12.542
And sometimes the one gets in
the way of the other.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.125
Yes, I..

07:15.208 --> 07:17.000
...imagine it could do that.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.542
What happened there?

07:26.625 --> 07:28.750
An accident while training
for hand-to-hand combat

07:28.833 --> 07:31.042
with one of the new
Drazi recruits.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.083
Faster than I thought.

07:34.167 --> 07:36.083
I hear you have
been training

07:36.167 --> 07:37.750
harder than you should.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.708
You should..

07:41.417 --> 07:43.333
[sighs]

07:43.417 --> 07:46.000
You should go more slowly.

07:46.083 --> 07:49.208
And if I had not
worked hard to be ready.

07:49.292 --> 07:51.458
Would you have called me now
for this?

08:02.542 --> 08:04.292
These are your instructions.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.958
You will be stationed
aboard White Star 27

08:08.042 --> 08:09.750
as one of the crew.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.708
The ship is already here,
waiting for you.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.417
I haven't told the captain
your mission.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.208
He knows only
that you and the rest

08:15.292 --> 08:17.208
are to be trained
in space combat

08:17.292 --> 08:19.458
in areas near
the Centauri border.

08:21.333 --> 08:25.250
As soon as you find anything,
return at once.

08:26.167 --> 08:28.542
I understand.

08:28.625 --> 08:32.333
I should go report to the ship
now so that we can get underway.

08:32.417 --> 08:34.333
There is no need
to hurry, Lennier.

08:34.417 --> 08:37.500
We could stay, talk awhile.
It's still early.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.458
I haven't seen you since..

08:39.542 --> 08:41.833
Since the Brakiri
day of the dead.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.875
No.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.833
It would not be wise.

08:51.083 --> 08:52.708
Delenn..

08:54.042 --> 08:55.750
During the day of the dead..

08:56.792 --> 08:58.167
Morden..

08:59.458 --> 09:00.958
...appeared to me

09:01.875 --> 09:03.875
and he-he said..

09:06.958 --> 09:09.958
He told me
that I would one day..

09:10.042 --> 09:11.833
...betray the rangers.

09:14.375 --> 09:15.875
Lennier.

09:17.333 --> 09:18.792
I cannot think of anything

09:18.875 --> 09:21.750
that would cause you
to betray the Anla-shok.

09:23.375 --> 09:24.625
Nor I.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.917
Good day, Delenn.

09:36.667 --> 09:37.708
[doorbell chimes]

09:37.792 --> 09:39.083
Yes?

09:45.625 --> 09:46.792
Vir?

09:47.875 --> 09:49.000
Help, please!

09:49.083 --> 09:51.292
Alright, alright.
Don't move.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.083
- I'll help!
- Ow!

09:53.167 --> 09:54.417
Easy. Easy. Easy.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.208
The finger.
The finger.

09:56.292 --> 09:58.167
Maker!
What is all this?

09:58.250 --> 10:00.917
Are we stocking up supplies
for the end of the universe?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.500
No, no, no, no.

10:02.583 --> 10:04.917
Just a second.
Uhh!

10:05.000 --> 10:07.417
You were away
for a long time.

10:07.500 --> 10:11.500
And then you came back,
and there was nothing fresh.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.833
And so I figured I'd lay in
supplies for a while.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.833
Nothing fresh?
What do you eat when I'm gone?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.375
Well, I eat, we..

10:18.458 --> 10:20.875
I mean, obviously,
we have plenty of, uh..

10:20.958 --> 10:22.667
I eat at Mcbari's.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.292
Mcbari's? Oh, is that the new
place in the brown sector?

10:25.375 --> 10:26.417
With the golden, uh--

10:26.500 --> 10:28.042
With the golden
head bones, yes.

10:28.125 --> 10:32.583
Vir...we are not biologically
equipped to handle fast food.

10:32.667 --> 10:36.417
I know, I know, but it-it tastes
so great going down.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.542
Coming up again,
it's not so terrific, but--

10:38.625 --> 10:40.167
Well, you'll have
to change that.

10:40.250 --> 10:42.625
We can't have someone
in your position

10:42.708 --> 10:45.708
eating at Mcbari's now, can we?

10:45.792 --> 10:47.083
Yes, but..

10:49.042 --> 10:50.375
What position?

10:50.458 --> 10:53.042
I have given the matter
considerable thought

10:53.125 --> 10:55.625
and I have decided to..

10:55.708 --> 10:58.583
[beeping]

11:07.125 --> 11:09.042
[beeping rapidly]

11:20.333 --> 11:22.292
Where did you buy this?

11:22.375 --> 11:25.333
Uh, a Drazi merchant
at the Zocalo.

11:26.292 --> 11:27.375
I'm sorry, Vir.

11:27.458 --> 11:29.750
I didn't mean
to sit on your supplies.

11:29.833 --> 11:31.250
I didn't even see them.

11:31.333 --> 11:33.875
You should be more careful where
you put things in the future.

11:33.958 --> 11:35.500
Y-you're right, Londo.
I was wrong.

11:35.583 --> 11:40.042
It was a-a very
silly mistake of me!

11:40.125 --> 11:42.875
Now the thing you must
remember about the Drazi

11:42.958 --> 11:45.042
is that they are
very insecure people

11:45.125 --> 11:48.458
but they have so much
to be insecure about.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.792
Did you know that the female
of their species

11:50.875 --> 11:54.333
will gladly mate with any other
species in the universe

11:54.417 --> 11:57.333
to avoid the males
of their own kind?

11:57.417 --> 12:00.792
Take the-the wife of the
Drazi ambassador, for example.

12:00.875 --> 12:03.750
'After spending an afternoon
of passion with her'

12:03.833 --> 12:08.292
the Gaim ambassador told me
the most amazing stories.

12:08.375 --> 12:12.458
Yes, you know that one day
he actually...oops.

12:12.542 --> 12:13.500
[thuds]

12:13.583 --> 12:15.292
There...hah.

12:15.375 --> 12:18.542
They should stew all day
over that.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.500
'Why would they
eavesdrop on us?'

12:20.583 --> 12:22.958
I mean, we're all
in the alliance together.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.792
I mean, what is wrong with them?

12:24.875 --> 12:28.083
It's politics, Vir.
Never take it personally.

12:28.167 --> 12:30.042
Now, where was I?
Oh, yes.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.958
Of course.
Your position.

12:33.042 --> 12:36.583
As you know, Vir,
I am to be emperor soon.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.667
As part of that change,
I must name a replacement.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.583
Now you are not
quite ready yet

12:42.667 --> 12:46.500
'but I am sure you will be
before I leave here.'

12:46.583 --> 12:50.125
Yes, Vir, I have decided
that when I am gone..

12:50.208 --> 12:53.500
...the new ambassador
to Babylon 5..

12:53.583 --> 12:55.250
...will be you.

12:57.917 --> 13:00.000
[instrumental music]

13:07.167 --> 13:09.875
(man on PA)
'White Star
bearing at 116 degrees.'

13:15.875 --> 13:18.042
Sir?

13:18.125 --> 13:21.125
Anla-shok Lennier.
Reporting for duty.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.625
Captain Enrique Montoya.

13:22.708 --> 13:24.542
Good to have you aboard.

13:24.625 --> 13:27.625
Delenn tells me you've been
in combat situations before.

13:27.708 --> 13:28.917
That is correct.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.458
I ran weapons and navigation
during the Shadow War

13:31.542 --> 13:32.958
under Delenn and Sheridan.

13:33.042 --> 13:35.167
Well, that's
pretty heady company.

13:35.250 --> 13:36.542
I'm not sure
what I can teach you

13:36.625 --> 13:38.375
that those two couldn't.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.208
But I'll try to find something.

13:41.292 --> 13:43.125
On the other hand, officially,
you're still a trainee

13:43.208 --> 13:45.375
so I have to treat you
the same as the others.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.875
I understand.

13:46.958 --> 13:48.750
Ah, Findell.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.542
This is Lennier.
He just joined the crew.

13:50.625 --> 13:51.917
Lennier,
this is Findell.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.333
Another trainee
assigned to The Maria.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.417
The...Maria?

13:56.500 --> 13:58.917
Officially, White Star 27.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.375
But what kind of a name
is that for a ship?

14:01.458 --> 14:02.708
You won't find it on any records

14:02.792 --> 14:04.333
but as far as I'm concerned

14:04.417 --> 14:06.417
it's The Maria,
named after my sister.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.875
Oh. And where is she?

14:09.833 --> 14:11.125
With God.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.708
Ha.

14:13.792 --> 14:16.958
Well, I think I may have asked
an indiscreet question.

14:17.042 --> 14:21.083
No, the captain does not believe
in indiscreet questions.

14:21.167 --> 14:23.125
He believes the only way
to get pertinent information

14:23.208 --> 14:26.792
is to ask impertinent questions.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.917
Well, then, I may have
finally found a home.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.875
All hands,
prepare for jump.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.750
(male #1)
'Initiating
hyperspace modules.'

14:33.833 --> 14:36.375
(female #2)
'Programming jump gate
activation sequence.'

14:36.458 --> 14:39.042
(male #2)
'Jump gate activation
at your command, captain.'

14:44.875 --> 14:46.167
(G'Kar)
Good news!

14:46.250 --> 14:49.292
I just ran into
Dr. Franklin on my way over.

14:49.375 --> 14:52.792
He says that my new
prosthetic eye is finally in!

14:52.875 --> 14:54.917
At last,
I'll have a matched set.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.375
You don't know what it's been
like looking into the mirror

14:57.458 --> 14:59.625
and seeing
these staring back at me!

14:59.708 --> 15:02.000
Well, then, we won't
keep either of you waiting.

15:02.083 --> 15:04.208
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Mr. President.

15:04.292 --> 15:06.833
Last night,
our main shipping lines

15:06.917 --> 15:09.750
were attacked again
by unknown forces.

15:09.833 --> 15:13.125
A-at least...unknown to us.

15:13.208 --> 15:14.625
We have reason to believe

15:14.708 --> 15:18.583
that you know who is
behind these attacks.

15:18.667 --> 15:22.000
We are still in the process
of conducting our investigation.

15:22.083 --> 15:25.667
Now we have had
several positive leads

15:25.750 --> 15:27.458
but we can't release
any information

15:27.542 --> 15:30.500
until we have
some conclusive answers.

15:30.583 --> 15:33.125
But I do wonder if these "leads"

15:33.208 --> 15:34.708
pointed to someone close to you.

15:34.792 --> 15:36.167
A-a-an ally.

15:36.250 --> 15:40.667
Perhaps someone in the advisory
board for the alliance.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.708
A major race
whose strength you need

15:43.792 --> 15:45.667
'to keep this alliance
together.'

15:45.750 --> 15:48.708
'Uh, let's say...
The Centauri.'

15:48.792 --> 15:53.333
I wonder if you would
be in a hurry to expose them.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.625
I appreciate your..

15:57.708 --> 16:00.250
...candor, Mr. Ambassador.

16:02.167 --> 16:03.917
But if we had absolute proof

16:04.000 --> 16:07.250
as to which race is behind these
attacks, we would release it

16:07.333 --> 16:09.250
no matter where the trail led.

16:09.333 --> 16:12.417
We have been patient with you
in the past, ambassador.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.958
We ask only that you now
be patient with us.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.875
We will be patient..

16:17.958 --> 16:20.542
ask it.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.500
But..

16:22.583 --> 16:24.750
...remember your promise.

16:24.833 --> 16:27.375
That once this evidence
was released, you would support

16:27.458 --> 16:30.083
any action the alliance worlds
decided upon.

16:30.167 --> 16:31.917
- We remember.
- Good.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.250
- Because I..
- Ah, good.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.542
I was hoping
to run into you here.

16:36.625 --> 16:38.292
Uh, Londo,
this is a private--

16:38.375 --> 16:39.708
The Centauri republic
is a member

16:39.792 --> 16:41.458
of the advisory council.

16:41.542 --> 16:46.000
Is there some reason why we have
been excluded from this meeting?

16:46.083 --> 16:48.708
So, ambassador,
how is the wife?

16:48.792 --> 16:51.417
- Not too tired, I hope.
- Londo..

16:51.500 --> 16:53.875
(Londo)
'No, it's alright.
I'm not offended.'

16:53.958 --> 16:55.542
I just came by
to mention to you all

16:55.625 --> 16:59.625
that someone must be terribly
inept, whoever it was.

16:59.708 --> 17:02.917
Planted a listening device
in my quarters this morning.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.167
'The very idea
is laughable.'

17:06.250 --> 17:07.500
'Absurd'

17:07.583 --> 17:09.000
even moronic.

17:09.083 --> 17:12.583
Wouldn't you say, ambassador?

17:12.667 --> 17:14.208
Well, I just wanted
to alert the rest of you

17:14.292 --> 17:18.583
in case anyone tries anything
equally as stupid as this again.

17:18.667 --> 17:22.792
Good day to you all.
ambassador.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.917
Oh..

17:24.000 --> 17:26.333
...and your wonderful

17:26.417 --> 17:28.458
beautiful wife.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.500
Get your evidence.

17:33.583 --> 17:36.667
And remember your promise,
president.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.250
We will keep you to it.

17:44.583 --> 17:47.667
[[instrumental music]

17:54.333 --> 17:55.542
Lennier.

17:55.625 --> 17:57.500
The captain has sent me
to find you.

17:57.583 --> 17:59.125
He would like us
to take out a pair of fighters

17:59.208 --> 18:02.125
and to scout the area
after we come out of hyperspace.

18:02.208 --> 18:04.667
Are we to look
for anything in particular?

18:04.750 --> 18:08.208
No. At-at least,
he didn't tell me.

18:08.292 --> 18:11.500
He often leaves out important
pieces of information like that.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.833
It is...frustrating.

18:13.917 --> 18:15.750
It is, I think

18:15.833 --> 18:17.875
the human way
of doing things.

18:17.958 --> 18:19.792
They try
to encourage initiative

18:19.875 --> 18:22.250
so that we may better react
to sudden changes.

18:22.333 --> 18:26.167
Our own techniques
tend to be...rigid.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.708
They have worked for the last
several thousand years

18:28.792 --> 18:32.042
and I see no reason
why we should change them now.

18:32.125 --> 18:35.083
Several thousand years ago,
we had no starships.

18:35.167 --> 18:38.083
Should we stay home
and pretend they do not exist?

18:38.167 --> 18:42.000
Findell, I have had considerable
contact with the humans.

18:42.083 --> 18:45.333
If this is difficult
for you, perhaps I could help.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.792
I am fine, thank you.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.250
Now, come along.

18:49.333 --> 18:52.000
We'll be jumping back
to normal space any time now.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.333
And steady now.
Ho-hold still.

18:56.417 --> 18:58.458
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

18:58.542 --> 19:01.750
That's it.
Let me just get this out here.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.375
That's it.

19:04.458 --> 19:06.625
There we go.

19:08.125 --> 19:12.042
I'm sorry it took so long
to get this new eye in, G'Kar.

19:12.125 --> 19:13.917
It's alright.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.042
All that matters
is that it's here.

19:17.125 --> 19:18.625
And, oh, uh..

19:18.708 --> 19:21.292
And by the way,
I've been..

19:21.375 --> 19:24.000
...reading your book.
Well, as much as I can.

19:24.083 --> 19:26.833
It's difficult to translate.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.917
It's very good actually.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.458
Thank you, I suppose.

19:31.542 --> 19:34.958
It wasn't supposed to come out
until after my death.

19:35.042 --> 19:38.125
I find the whole thing
rather embarrassing.

19:38.208 --> 19:40.417
[chuckles]
Well, why?

19:40.500 --> 19:43.333
You shouldn't.
It's a good book.

19:43.417 --> 19:45.792
It's got some
interesting ideas.

19:45.875 --> 19:47.958
You know,
one question though, uh..

19:48.042 --> 19:51.750
Every copy seems to have
a circular stain on page 83.

19:53.542 --> 19:57.542
All our holy books are
reproduced exactly as written.

19:57.625 --> 19:59.250
Line for line,
word for word.

19:59.333 --> 20:02.375
Right down to the flaws
in the paper.

20:02.458 --> 20:07.042
The circular stain is a coffee
stain left by Mr. Garibaldi.

20:07.125 --> 20:08.708
When I confronted him
with it, he said

20:08.792 --> 20:10.458
it's the best part of the book.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.292
[chuckles]

20:12.375 --> 20:14.042
What prompted you to read it?

20:14.125 --> 20:15.833
Now that should do it.

20:16.958 --> 20:19.292
Well, I'm a foundationist.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.000
And the idea
behind the foundation

20:21.083 --> 20:26.958
is that to get back to the roots
of...all the earth religions

20:27.042 --> 20:29.167
get past the, uh, doctrines

20:29.250 --> 20:31.958
to the core..
of each belief system

20:32.042 --> 20:34.375
and find out what
they have in common.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.417
And they've got a lot more
in common than you think.

20:36.500 --> 20:40.625
It's just when, uh,
politics and money and..

20:40.708 --> 20:42.042
...nationalism get in the way

20:42.125 --> 20:44.792
that, uh, things get
a little messed up.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.292
There we go.

20:48.208 --> 20:49.542
[Stephen sighs]

20:50.667 --> 20:52.417
(Stephen)
'How's that?'

20:55.625 --> 20:56.667
It's perfect.

20:56.750 --> 21:00.167
It's absolutely perfect.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.208
I don't know how to thank you.

21:02.292 --> 21:03.833
Well, I do.

21:03.917 --> 21:07.000
I understand that you're giving
weekly talks to your people

21:07.083 --> 21:09.292
based on what's in
the book of G'Kar.

21:09.375 --> 21:11.000
I talk, they ask questions.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.167
I don't think
anything gets resolved.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.333
Well, I-I'd like to come
and sit in on them

21:15.417 --> 21:16.625
if you don't mind.

21:16.708 --> 21:18.667
As you wish.

21:18.750 --> 21:20.958
You have given me
back my sight.

21:22.583 --> 21:26.500
The least I can do in return is
share a little of my confusion.

21:26.583 --> 21:28.542
Thank you again.

21:35.292 --> 21:37.333
[indistinct chatter]

21:38.625 --> 21:40.208
Lennier, Findell.

21:40.292 --> 21:42.042
'We're in position.
Are you ready to go?'

21:42.125 --> 21:44.208
(Findell on radio)
'Confirmed.'

21:44.292 --> 21:46.042
Ready here, captain.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.417
Very well.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.583

22:02.125 --> 22:04.250

22:04.333 --> 22:06.542
All systems functional.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.667

22:08.750 --> 22:10.917

[beeping]

22:14.833 --> 22:16.583
Findell..

22:16.667 --> 22:19.250
Did you check your atmosphere
system prior to launch?

22:19.333 --> 22:20.500
(Findell on radio)
'I did.'

22:20.583 --> 22:22.083
So did I.

22:22.167 --> 22:24.458
But the readings just changed.

22:24.542 --> 22:26.458
Mine shows fifteen percent
capacity

22:26.542 --> 22:28.958
a little over one hour
of air left.

22:29.042 --> 22:31.458
So does mine.

22:31.542 --> 22:33.333
[beeping]

22:33.417 --> 22:35.417
Something is wrong.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.958
We should return
to the ship.

22:37.042 --> 22:38.125
Uh..

22:39.625 --> 22:41.708
Lennier, The White Star.

22:42.875 --> 22:45.250
They-they just
left us behind.

22:45.333 --> 22:48.250
Perhaps they received
an emergency call

22:48.333 --> 22:50.292
'a distress signal or..'

22:50.375 --> 22:52.875
'...or an attack on one
of the nearby shipping lanes.'

22:52.958 --> 22:56.792
Lennier, we have less
than one hour of air left.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.792
Yes..

22:58.875 --> 23:02.125
...and the nearest habitable
planet is three days away.

23:03.375 --> 23:05.542
So unless they
get back here soon..

23:07.375 --> 23:08.917
...we're dead.

23:20.208 --> 23:21.583
Findell..

23:23.208 --> 23:24.542
You still there?

23:24.625 --> 23:27.125
(Findell)
Still here.

23:27.208 --> 23:28.875
Where have they gone,
Lennier?

23:30.250 --> 23:32.208
(Lennier)
I do not know.

23:32.292 --> 23:36.167
know is that we have
less than an hour of air left.

23:36.250 --> 23:38.125
Findell, did you make it through

23:38.208 --> 23:40.708
Turval's instructions
and meditation?

23:40.792 --> 23:42.208
Yeah, but..

23:42.292 --> 23:44.167
'Then I suggest we enter
a meditative state'

23:44.250 --> 23:47.167
to conserve what little air
we have left.

23:47.250 --> 23:49.833
Concentrate on slowing down
your heartbeat

23:49.917 --> 23:51.917
and your respiration.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.667
We may be able to last
almost two hours that way.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.667
'I don't know..'

23:57.750 --> 23:59.417
'I don't know if I can.'

24:00.417 --> 24:03.292
It is not necessary to know.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.542
It is only necessary to try.

24:09.792 --> 24:11.417
Alright.

24:16.208 --> 24:18.417
(G'Kar)
'And as a result..'

24:18.500 --> 24:23.000
...we spend too much time
trying to be serious.

24:23.083 --> 24:25.833
As if that proved that
we were more enlightened

24:25.917 --> 24:27.542
better than everyone else.

24:27.625 --> 24:29.083
[chuckles]

24:29.167 --> 24:30.875
But we can't be free..

24:32.167 --> 24:35.625
...until we learn
to laugh at ourselves.

24:35.708 --> 24:39.875
Once you look in the mirror and
see just how foolish we can be

24:39.958 --> 24:42.042
laughter is inevitable.

24:42.125 --> 24:45.208
And from laughter
comes wisdom.

24:47.083 --> 24:48.750
Next question.

24:50.583 --> 24:52.208
What is truth?

24:52.292 --> 24:53.917
And what is God?

24:55.625 --> 24:58.458
(G'Kar)
You don't really want
an answer to that question.

24:58.542 --> 24:59.583
Yes, I do.

24:59.667 --> 25:01.083
Please.

25:04.417 --> 25:07.708
If I take a lamp
and shine it toward the wall

25:07.792 --> 25:10.417
a bright spot
will appear on the wall.

25:10.500 --> 25:14.958
The lamp is our search
for truth, for understanding.

25:16.458 --> 25:20.292
Too often, we assume that
the light on the wall is God.

25:21.708 --> 25:24.542
But the light is not
the goal of the search.

25:24.625 --> 25:27.250
result
of the search.

25:27.333 --> 25:29.208
'The more intense the search'

25:29.292 --> 25:31.792
the brighter the light
on the wall.

25:31.875 --> 25:33.667
The brighter the light
on the wall

25:33.750 --> 25:38.500
the greater the sense
of revelation upon seeing it.

25:38.583 --> 25:42.500
Similarly, someone
who does not search

25:42.583 --> 25:45.708
who does not bring
a lantern with him

25:46.583 --> 25:48.208
sees nothing.

25:51.667 --> 25:52.750
[sighs]

25:53.542 --> 25:55.833
What we perceive as God

25:55.917 --> 25:59.958
is the by-product
of our search for God.

26:00.042 --> 26:03.542
It may simply be
an appreciation of the light

26:03.625 --> 26:05.458
pure and unblemished.

26:05.542 --> 26:08.292
Not understanding
that it comes from us.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.208
Sometimes we stand
in front of the light

26:12.292 --> 26:15.625
and assume that we are
the center of the universe.

26:15.708 --> 26:19.125
God looks
astonishingly like we do.

26:19.208 --> 26:21.625
Or we turn
to look at our shadow

26:21.708 --> 26:24.833
and assume
that all is darkness.

26:24.917 --> 26:28.125
If we allow ourselves
to get in the way..

26:28.208 --> 26:29.750
...we defeat the purpose.

26:31.042 --> 26:33.667
Which is to use
the light of our search

26:33.750 --> 26:36.750
to illuminate the wall
in all its beauty

26:37.667 --> 26:40.375
and in all its flaws.

26:40.458 --> 26:44.500
And in so doing better
understand the world around us.

26:45.458 --> 26:47.292
Ah.. Yes.

26:47.375 --> 26:49.667
But..

26:49.750 --> 26:52.333
What is truth?
And what is God?

26:52.417 --> 26:54.042
[chuckles]

26:55.833 --> 26:59.667
[sighs]
Truth is...a river.

26:59.750 --> 27:03.125
- 'Oh, yes.'
- And what is God?

27:04.042 --> 27:05.917
God is..

27:07.458 --> 27:08.833
...the mouth of the river.

27:08.917 --> 27:11.125
Oh! Yes, of course.

27:12.125 --> 27:15.208
[indistinct chatter]

27:16.542 --> 27:19.625
[instrumental music]

27:34.875 --> 27:36.250
(Findell on radio)
'Lennier.'

27:37.333 --> 27:38.792
'Lennier.'

27:42.208 --> 27:43.917
Findell..

27:44.000 --> 27:45.708
What is it?

27:45.792 --> 27:48.125
I can't breathe.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.750
(Lennier on radio)
'You have to calm yourself.'

27:50.833 --> 27:52.583
[gasping]
I can't.

27:53.500 --> 27:54.917
A-air's..

27:55.000 --> 27:56.542
...down to..

27:56.625 --> 27:58.042
...to almost..

27:58.750 --> 27:59.792
...nothing.

27:59.875 --> 28:01.250
[panting]

28:03.000 --> 28:06.083
Have-have to find
someplace..

28:06.167 --> 28:08.958
Have to-have to find
someplace with air.

28:09.833 --> 28:11.500
Have to get out of here.

28:11.583 --> 28:13.375
Have to get out of here.

28:15.542 --> 28:17.958
(Lennier)
Findell, stop.

28:18.042 --> 28:19.500
Listen to me.

28:19.583 --> 28:23.083
We have to stay here
so that they can find us.

28:23.167 --> 28:25.375
Turn around, don't..

28:27.417 --> 28:31.333
(Montoya)
This is The Maria to recruits.
Stand by for retrieval.

28:31.417 --> 28:34.875
Report to the bunkroom
upon arrival for debriefing.

28:34.958 --> 28:37.083
Montoya out.

28:43.208 --> 28:44.875
There will be times
when you may be left

28:44.958 --> 28:47.417
or abandoned in the course
of battle.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.500
The ship...and its mission,
whatever it happens to be

28:50.583 --> 28:53.583
must be protected
above all else.

28:53.667 --> 28:56.417
And if that means leaving..

28:56.500 --> 28:58.583
...then we'll do it.

28:58.667 --> 29:01.000
We deliberately left you
with only one hour's air

29:01.083 --> 29:03.750
to evaluate your response.

29:03.833 --> 29:06.208
Lennier's analysis
was correct.

29:06.292 --> 29:07.792
Lower heartbeat
and respiration

29:07.875 --> 29:09.917
to extend what air you had

29:10.000 --> 29:11.833
and to stay where you were

29:11.917 --> 29:14.500
to assist in recovery.

29:14.583 --> 29:19.292
To be Anla-shok
means understanding

29:19.375 --> 29:21.208
that there is nothing
to fear in death

29:21.292 --> 29:24.917
except the failure to complete
our assigned mission.

29:25.750 --> 29:28.250
Death is not the enemy.

29:28.333 --> 29:31.042
Death simply is.

29:32.375 --> 29:33.500
- This one?
- Okay.

29:33.583 --> 29:35.000
You.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.625
I want to have a word with you.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.417
Oh. I'm very busy.

29:38.500 --> 29:41.042
You planted this in a bag
of fruit you sold me.

29:41.125 --> 29:43.042
You tried to spy
on my government.

29:43.125 --> 29:44.667
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.167
Now, you go away.

29:46.250 --> 29:48.083
No, not until you admit

29:48.167 --> 29:50.833
to what you have done
and you tell me why.

29:50.917 --> 29:53.208
Or what?

29:53.292 --> 29:55.500
We all know you, Vir Cotto.

29:55.583 --> 29:57.417
We know what you are.

29:57.500 --> 29:58.917
You are weak.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.500
You are foolish.

30:00.583 --> 30:03.750
And now you will go away
or I will swat you.

30:03.833 --> 30:05.792
[laughter]

30:05.875 --> 30:08.958
[indistinct chatter]

30:14.625 --> 30:16.917
[both scoff]

30:17.000 --> 30:18.333
[laughter]

30:25.125 --> 30:26.750
Something I can do
for you, Vir?

30:26.833 --> 30:28.208
No. I just need to borrow
this for a minute.

30:28.292 --> 30:30.042
I'll be right back.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.417
[screaming]

30:40.833 --> 30:41.917
[grunting]

30:42.000 --> 30:43.083
What are you doing?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.333
- No.
- Now!

30:47.417 --> 30:50.625
Want to finish our little
conversation spoo for brains?

30:50.708 --> 30:51.958
Grave misunderstanding.

30:52.042 --> 30:54.000
It-it-it was a terrible mistake.

30:54.083 --> 30:56.333
That's what I thought
you'd say.

30:56.417 --> 30:58.042
[grunts]

31:03.500 --> 31:06.292
- What happened to Vir?
- Oh, I promoted him.

31:08.208 --> 31:12.667
Now...now he is ready to be
the ambassador for the Centauri.

31:20.083 --> 31:22.292
(Montoya)
'Good morning, trainees.'

31:22.375 --> 31:24.792
We are currently in orbit
near a red giant star

31:24.875 --> 31:27.625
in a system where several
gas giants on the edge

31:27.708 --> 31:30.792
of the solar system have
collapsed or been destroyed.

31:30.875 --> 31:34.167
Leaving behind a fairly
substantial asteroid field

31:34.250 --> 31:38.167
of ice chunks and solid rock.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.542
I've chosen this
as the perfect place

31:40.625 --> 31:43.292
for an Easter egg hunt.

31:43.375 --> 31:45.708
Now, while you were sleeping
we seeded the asteroid field

31:45.792 --> 31:49.125
with 39 short-range
homing devices.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.792
Now, you have to get
pretty close

31:51.875 --> 31:53.292
in order to detect them.

31:53.375 --> 31:55.417
So we're talking
close-proximity scans

31:55.500 --> 31:59.083
of large, fast-moving,
and extremely dangerous objects.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.708
Your mission

32:00.792 --> 32:04.458
is to find and destroy no less
than ten of the homing devices

32:04.542 --> 32:08.000
while avoiding the possibility
of getting hit and destroyed

32:08.083 --> 32:09.750
by an asteroid yourself.

32:09.833 --> 32:11.083
- Sir.
- 'Yes.'

32:11.167 --> 32:12.750
There are four of us

32:12.833 --> 32:16.083
but you said there were 39
of the homing devices.

32:16.167 --> 32:17.500
That's right.

32:17.583 --> 32:21.333
Meaning someone
will come up short.

32:21.417 --> 32:25.583
A little competition is good
for the soul, Lindell.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.333
Your fighters
have been fully armed.

32:30.417 --> 32:32.333
And you will leave
your ship weapons hot.

32:32.417 --> 32:34.250
Go to it.

32:36.417 --> 32:38.042
Findell..

32:38.125 --> 32:40.208
He knows I'm going to fail.

32:41.792 --> 32:42.917
I saw it in his eyes.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.292
We see what we want to see.

32:46.583 --> 32:49.000
think I'm going to fail.

32:49.083 --> 32:52.500
Findell, why did you join
the Anla-shok?

32:52.583 --> 32:54.000
Because..

32:56.542 --> 32:59.750
Because I lost two of my family
during the Shadow War.

33:01.292 --> 33:03.333
They were Anla-shok.

33:04.875 --> 33:07.250
And it fell to me
to carry on their work.

33:08.458 --> 33:10.083
If you are doing this
because you feel

33:10.167 --> 33:13.833
be doing this,
not because you want to

33:13.917 --> 33:15.875
then your purpose is flawed.

33:15.958 --> 33:18.542
The desire to be Anla-shok
must be pure and unselfish.

33:18.625 --> 33:21.333
You can't let anything
get in the way.

33:21.417 --> 33:22.708
I won't.

33:30.333 --> 33:33.417

You may fire at will.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.875
Do you confirm?

34:20.958 --> 34:23.708
Findell, I repeat,
do you confirm?

'Findell, answer me.'

35:05.583 --> 35:07.083
Go away, Lennier.

35:08.375 --> 35:10.500
You were right.

35:10.583 --> 35:12.708
My soul's purpose
is not clear.

35:14.292 --> 35:17.292
I know I am not Anla-shok..

35:17.375 --> 35:19.792
...and I cannot return home
in shame.

in this, either.'

(Montoya)
Lennier, what the hell
was that all about?

36:27.708 --> 36:29.083
Captain, I--

36:29.167 --> 36:31.500
You opened fire
on a ship under the command

36:31.583 --> 36:33.250
of one of your fellow recruits

36:33.333 --> 36:35.708
and then rammed said ship
and damn near got yourself

36:35.792 --> 36:37.208
killed in the process.

36:37.292 --> 36:39.458
Now, I would like
to hear an explanation.

36:39.542 --> 36:41.375
Captain, the fault
was not Ranger Lennier's.

36:41.458 --> 36:43.417
The weapons system
of my fighter was disrupted

36:43.500 --> 36:46.000
by a nearby explosion,
and it began firing

36:46.083 --> 36:48.250
before I could stop it.

36:48.333 --> 36:49.667
The computer records indicate

36:49.750 --> 36:51.792
you took manual control
of your ship.

36:51.875 --> 36:53.500
(Lennier)
'Yes, sir,
it was the only way I could'

36:53.583 --> 36:55.125
'bring it back under control.'

36:55.208 --> 36:58.500
Along the way, I struck
Findell's ship a glancing blow.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.667
He navigated his response
to help direct me

37:00.750 --> 37:02.125
from a collision
with the asteroid.

37:02.208 --> 37:04.667
- Captain--
- Did I say I was finished?

37:05.792 --> 37:07.583
No, sir.

37:07.667 --> 37:10.917
Lennier, I don't know
what went on out there

37:11.000 --> 37:12.750
and I doubt if I ever will

37:12.833 --> 37:15.500
but for purposes of bookkeeping
I'm giving you a failing mark

37:15.583 --> 37:17.417
in the Easter egg hunt.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.000
And we'll never know what
Findell would have done

37:19.083 --> 37:20.792
since you shot up his fighter.

37:20.875 --> 37:23.208
So he gets a neutral grade.

37:25.167 --> 37:27.458
And as for you..

37:27.542 --> 37:29.792
...I've been giving this
a great deal of thought.

37:29.875 --> 37:33.042
And I've arranged
for an assignment for you.

37:33.125 --> 37:36.750
A cruiser will meet us in route
to our next training mission

37:36.833 --> 37:38.958
and return you to Minbar
where you will work

37:39.042 --> 37:41.667
in a recruitment office
in Tuzanor

37:41.750 --> 37:43.250
helping debrief new recruits.

37:43.333 --> 37:44.542
Sir, I--

37:44.625 --> 37:46.750
I want you to look
into their eyes, Findell

37:46.833 --> 37:47.958
and I want you to ask them

37:48.042 --> 37:50.000
from the very bottom
of their soul

37:50.083 --> 37:53.250
if this is really
what they want to do.

37:54.417 --> 37:57.000
I don't want you
to let anyone through

37:57.083 --> 38:00.125
who's here
for the wrong reasons.

38:00.208 --> 38:02.375
'Not just for
their own safety..'

38:04.167 --> 38:08.375
...but for the sake
of all the Anla-shok.

38:10.917 --> 38:14.083
This is an important
task, Findell.

38:14.167 --> 38:16.958
Understand that.

38:17.042 --> 38:19.125
There's no shame
in accepting it.

38:19.208 --> 38:20.833
And there's no one
who can execute it

38:20.917 --> 38:23.667
as well as I feel you can.

38:23.750 --> 38:28.667
serve all your
fellow rangers with honor.

38:28.750 --> 38:32.083
Yes, captain, I do understand.

38:32.167 --> 38:33.375
Thank you.

38:42.708 --> 38:44.875
- Lennier.
- Yes, sir.

38:44.958 --> 38:48.625
Off the record and as
unofficially as I can get..

38:50.458 --> 38:53.208
...you did a good job out there.

38:53.292 --> 38:55.542
I won't put it on his record,
I think we took care of that

38:55.625 --> 38:57.750
problem as best we can.

39:00.042 --> 39:02.583
But I know.

39:02.667 --> 39:06.458
And you should learn
one very important lesson.

39:06.542 --> 39:10.750
Never, ever assume
that no one can listen in

39:10.833 --> 39:13.292
on a private channel. Hmm?

39:14.583 --> 39:15.583
[chuckles]

39:15.667 --> 39:16.792
Huh.

39:16.875 --> 39:18.542
Now, go get some rest.

39:19.500 --> 39:20.917
I will.

39:22.333 --> 39:23.708
Thank you, captain.

39:28.167 --> 39:31.792
Alright. Prepare to jump
to our next training area.

39:31.875 --> 39:33.500
(female #3)
'Jump engines online.'

39:33.583 --> 39:35.083
(male #3)
'Initiating hyperspace..'

39:35.167 --> 39:37.250
[sighs]

39:37.333 --> 39:39.667
(male #3)
'Ready to jump
at your command, captain.'

39:41.625 --> 39:42.667
Jump.

39:48.667 --> 39:49.667
[laughing]

39:49.750 --> 39:52.208
I'm telling you,
you should've seen him.

39:52.292 --> 39:54.333
Vir was whacking
the hell out of that place

39:54.417 --> 39:56.958
and the Drazi's on the ground,
he's almost twice his size

39:57.042 --> 39:59.083
and the little guy's
got him vibrating so bad

39:59.167 --> 40:01.792
I think he's gonna slide through
the molecules of the deck

40:01.875 --> 40:03.625
and come out the other side.

40:05.167 --> 40:07.125
I wish I'd have seen that.

40:07.208 --> 40:08.917
I've never heard of Vir
losing his temper

40:09.000 --> 40:11.458
like that before,
I mean..

40:11.542 --> 40:13.125
No wonder the Drazi
was scared.

40:13.208 --> 40:16.250
Hell, if Vir's that mad,
who wouldn't be scared?

40:16.333 --> 40:19.167
- Well, did you arrest him?
- Well, yes and no.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.000
I pulled him aside and talked
to him, but nobody got hurt.

40:22.083 --> 40:24.375
The Drazi didn't want
to press charges

40:24.458 --> 40:26.542
because that would be admitting
that Vir was mad at him

40:26.625 --> 40:28.667
because he bugged
Londo's quarters.

40:28.750 --> 40:29.833
Yeah? How was Londo?

40:29.917 --> 40:31.958
Oh, like a proud father.

40:32.042 --> 40:35.000
Watching as Vir
took that place apart.

40:35.083 --> 40:37.417
"Today he is a man."

40:37.500 --> 40:39.458
[laughing]

40:39.542 --> 40:41.208
You know..

40:41.292 --> 40:43.167
...I almost wish the Drazi

40:43.250 --> 40:45.292
had succeeded
in bugging his place.

40:45.375 --> 40:46.708
I mean, it's not something
we can do.

40:46.792 --> 40:48.583
It wouldn't be right.

40:48.667 --> 40:51.458
But we could have found out
what they're up to.

40:51.542 --> 40:53.292
Why they're hitting
the other worlds.

40:53.375 --> 40:55.000
It would have done no good.

40:55.083 --> 40:57.708
I still don't think
Londo knows about the attacks

40:57.792 --> 40:58.875
on alliance ships.

40:58.958 --> 41:01.375
And that worries me.

41:01.458 --> 41:03.167
If somebody back home
can pull this off

41:03.250 --> 41:05.083
without him knowing about it,
being prime minister

41:05.167 --> 41:06.958
then it has to come
from the very top

41:07.042 --> 41:09.042
of the Centauri Royal Palace.

41:09.125 --> 41:10.625
And that means trouble.

41:10.708 --> 41:12.208
Well, it's gonna be
more trouble

41:12.292 --> 41:14.708
if we don't get
the proof we need.

41:14.792 --> 41:17.750
Now, the other worlds will wait,
but not for long.

41:17.833 --> 41:19.375
I think maybe
we have a month

41:19.458 --> 41:22.708
before they decide to take
things into their own hands.

41:22.792 --> 41:24.625
And without proof

41:24.708 --> 41:26.750
we're going to have to oppose
anything they do.

41:26.833 --> 41:29.917
And that will be the end
of the alliance

41:30.000 --> 41:31.625
and the start of another war.

41:31.708 --> 41:34.000
Well, let's not go
borrow trouble.

41:34.083 --> 41:35.708
We still have a month to go,
and we can do a lot

41:35.792 --> 41:37.375
in that amount of time.

41:39.167 --> 41:41.083
I agree.

41:41.167 --> 41:44.042
So where is Garibaldi?
I haven't seen him all day.

41:44.125 --> 41:45.333
I thought he was going to come.

41:45.417 --> 41:48.167
I sent him a note.
Perhaps he didn't get it.
