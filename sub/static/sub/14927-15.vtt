WEBVTT

00:05.539 --> 00:07.575
THIS IS SO ROMANTIC.

00:07.608 --> 00:08.342
YEAH, IT'S OK.

00:08.376 --> 00:12.513
COME ON, BABY,
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME

00:12.546 --> 00:15.349
AND 100 10th GRADERS.

00:15.383 --> 00:18.552
ARE WE REALLY OLD ENOUGH
TO BE CHAPERONES?

00:18.586 --> 00:20.388
GOD, DOESN'T IT SEEM
LIKE YESTERDAY

00:20.421 --> 00:22.523
THAT WE WERE HERE
FOR OUR DANCE?

00:22.556 --> 00:24.692
THAT WAS ROMANTIC.

00:24.725 --> 00:30.298
* AND I WANT YOU
TO SHOW ME *

00:30.331 --> 00:34.568
* I WANT TO FEEL
WHAT LOVE IS *

00:34.602 --> 00:35.303
OH, YEAH.

00:35.336 --> 00:40.208
* AND I KNOW
YOU CAN SHOW ME *

00:40.241 --> 00:42.476
OH, BABY--
YEAH, LOVER?

00:42.510 --> 00:44.645
I THINK I'M GONNA HURF.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.281
YOU OK?

00:47.315 --> 00:48.716
YEAH!
COOL.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.151
YEAH, I'M GOOD.

00:50.184 --> 00:56.290
* AND I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN FACE IT
AGAIN *

00:56.324 --> 00:59.160
* OH, CAN'T STOP NOW

00:59.193 --> 01:05.533
Both: * I'VE TRAVELED
TOO FAR TO CHANGE THIS *

01:13.607 --> 01:15.609
SISTER HELEN!

01:15.643 --> 01:20.181
OH, THAT'S NOT OURS.

01:20.214 --> 01:25.619
Both: * AND I WANT YOU
TO SHOW ME *

01:26.754 --> 01:28.722
IT'S FOREIGNER, MAN.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.258
FOREIGNER.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.260
Lily:
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH!

01:32.293 --> 01:33.394
FATHER, CHILL OUT!

01:33.427 --> 01:35.629
OH, OH!
I DIDN'T DO IT!

01:35.663 --> 01:37.498
I DIDN'T DO IT!

01:37.531 --> 01:39.567
YOU THINK SHE DID IT?

01:39.600 --> 01:40.668
PROBABLY.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.270
MOMMY!

01:56.484 --> 01:57.318
YOU WERE MAGNIFICENT
BACK THERE.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.753
LOOK, JUST SHUT UP
AND GET ME SOME FOOD.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.290
ANYTHING FOR YOU,
DAD. YOU'RE MY MAN.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.291
I AM NOT YOUR MAN!

02:03.324 --> 02:05.459
AND I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D STOP TREATING ME

02:05.493 --> 02:07.261
LIKE I'M YOUR MAN.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.797
YOU'RE MY MAN.

02:10.664 --> 02:11.865
IS THIS
AN "R" RATED MOVIE?

02:11.899 --> 02:14.868
OH, NO, IT'S JUST GOT
VIOLENCE, ADULT LANGUAGE,

02:14.902 --> 02:16.904
AND STRONG SEXUAL SCENES.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.273
AND YOUR PARENTS
LET YOU WATCH THIS?

02:19.307 --> 02:21.675
THEY'RE CHAPERONING
LILY'S DANCE.

02:21.709 --> 02:22.510
IT'S GOING OFF.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.545
BUT IT'S
MICKEY ROURKE.

02:24.578 --> 02:25.946
OFF!

02:25.979 --> 02:27.815
GRANDPA, DO YOU HAVE
AN INCINERATOR

02:27.848 --> 02:29.450
DOWN AT THE DUMP?

02:29.483 --> 02:30.684
YEAH.
GOOD.

02:30.718 --> 02:33.387
CAN YOU PLEASE BURN
ALL OF MY SCHOOL UNIFORMS?

02:33.421 --> 02:34.422
I'M QUITTING ST. FINIAN'S

02:34.455 --> 02:36.490
AND GOING TO PUBLIC SCHOOL
WITH MY BOYFRIEND DEAN.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.891
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

02:37.925 --> 02:39.227
AND WHY THE HELL
ARE YOU HERE

02:39.260 --> 02:40.761
WHILE YOUR PARENTS
ARE AT YOUR DANCE?

02:40.794 --> 02:43.497
BECAUSE DEAN AND I
HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY PERSECUTED!

02:43.531 --> 02:46.200
SISTER HELEN CAUGHT US
WITH AN EMPTY LIQUOR BOTTLE,

02:46.234 --> 02:48.602
AND SHE REFUSED TO BELIEVE
THAT WE WEREN'T DRINKING.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.704
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU
WEREN'T DRINKING.

02:50.738 --> 02:51.605
OH!

02:51.639 --> 02:54.208
LILY, WE HAVE TO TALK.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.277
WHY? YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME, EITHER.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.945
NOBODY DOES!

02:57.978 --> 02:59.680
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU 2?

02:59.713 --> 03:00.548
WHAT DID WE DO?!

03:00.581 --> 03:01.415
YOUR DAUGHTER WAS
DRINKING AT THE DANCE

03:01.449 --> 03:03.651
THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE CHAPERONING.

03:03.684 --> 03:07.255
WE NEVER ASKED
TO CHAPERONE THAT DANCE.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.390
LILY'S DANCE IS
THIS SATURDAY,

03:09.423 --> 03:10.658
AND NOBODY ASKED
NANCY HINGLE.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.527
OH, SHE SEEMS
LIKE A NICE GIRL,
THAT'S A SHAME.

03:13.561 --> 03:16.564
IT MEANS SHE'S AVAILABLE
TO BABY-SIT.

03:16.597 --> 03:17.898
DATE NIGHT.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.333
WE COULD GO TO A MOVIE.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.701
A NEW MOVIE
IN A REAL THEATER.

03:20.734 --> 03:24.505
YEAH, WITH POPCORN
AND STICKY FLOORS
THAT AREN'T OURS.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.374
SOUNDS GOOD.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.876
AH, MR. AND MRS. FINNERTY,

03:28.909 --> 03:31.445
JUST THE PEOPLE
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.946
WELL, YOU FOUND US.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.882
WELL, AS YOU KNOW,
EVERY PARENT AT ST. FINIAN'S

03:34.915 --> 03:37.818
IS REQUIRED TO VOLUNTEER
FOR SOME KIND OF SERVICE

03:37.851 --> 03:38.519
FOR THE SCHOOL.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.689
YEAH, WE ALREADY
DID SOMETHING.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.624
YES, YOU PROVIDED A BOX
OF STORE-BOUGHT COOKIES

03:43.657 --> 03:46.327
FOR OUR BAKE SALE
IN 1998.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.361
IT WAS AN ASSORTMENT.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.297
WELL AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

03:49.330 --> 03:51.332
THIS SATURDAY NIGHT.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.835
YOU'RE CHAPERONING
MY DANCE?

03:54.868 --> 03:56.437
WE ARE SO SORRY.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.671
THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MY BIG NIGHT.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.740
IT'S THE FIRST NIGHT
THAT EVERYBODY AT SCHOOL

03:59.773 --> 04:01.309
IS GONNA SEE ME
WITH MY NEW BOYFRIEND.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.744
AND NOW THEY'RE GONNA
SEE ME WITH MY BOYFRIEND,

04:03.777 --> 04:04.612
MY MOMMY AND MY DADDY.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.714
WE'LL STAY OUT
OF YOUR WAY,
WE PROMISE.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.749
WE'LL AVOID YOU
COMPLETELY.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.384
WE WON'T
EVEN TALK TO YOU.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.619
IF I CATCH HIM
LOOKING AT YOU,

04:11.652 --> 04:12.720
I'M GONNA STEP
ON HIS FOOT.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.322
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT'LL BE OUR
SIGNAL TO EACH OTHER

04:14.355 --> 04:16.457
IN CASE
WE ACCIDENTALLY
LOOK AT YOU.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.825
I'M GONNA WEAR HEELS.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.693
ME, TOO.

04:21.094 --> 04:21.862
AND WE WERE GOOD.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.498
YEAH, WE LEFT HER
COMPLETELY ALONE.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.567
THAT'S VERY CONSIDERATE,

04:26.600 --> 04:27.468
'CAUSE KIDS NEED SPACE

04:27.501 --> 04:30.771
WHEN THEY'RE DRINKING
A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.973
HERE YOU GO, MY MAN.
MY MAN.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.742
WHAT IS THIS?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.310
IT'S A HALF
A ROAST BEEF SUB

04:36.344 --> 04:38.446
AND A THERMOS
OF SOME KIND OF SOUP.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.682
HEY, THAT'S MY LUNCH
FOR TOMORROW!

04:41.715 --> 04:43.584
IF YOU THINK STEALING
YOUR BROTHER'S FOOD

04:43.617 --> 04:44.952
AND GIVING IT TO ME
IS GONNA MAKE UP

04:44.985 --> 04:45.753
FOR WHAT YOU DID--

04:45.786 --> 04:47.721
IT'S JUST MY WAY
OF SAYING THANK YOU.

04:47.755 --> 04:50.458
YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT REAL THANKS
WOULD HAVE BEEN?

04:50.491 --> 04:53.894
IF YOU'D GOTTEN ME
MY PIZZA 2 HOURS AGO.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.968
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU SHOWED UP.

05:01.001 --> 05:01.669
I KNOW WE HAD A DEAL,

05:01.702 --> 05:03.704
I'M NOT DENYING
WE HAD A DEAL.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.507
I CANNOT HELP WHAT
YOUR EXPECTATIONS WERE.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.741
COME ON, I'M STARVIN'.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.477
WE'RE THROUGH TALKING.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.711
THANK GOD. LET'S EAT.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.780
ALL RIGHT,
I GOTTA TALK
TO THIS GUY.

05:12.813 --> 05:13.881
COME ON.
I'VE GOT A HEADACHE.

05:13.914 --> 05:14.682
ALL I'VE HAD TO EAT TODAY

05:14.715 --> 05:16.750
IS A POP TART
AND SOME APPLE JUICE.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.719
ONE MORE MINUTE IS
NOT GONNA KILL YOU.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.654
LET'S GO.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.891
YOU MADE PROMISES.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.794
I MAY HAVE MADE
IMPLICATIONS.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.597
YOU MADE
IMPLICATIONS.

05:29.630 --> 05:32.666
IMPLICATIONS ARE
NOT CONTRACTS.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.770
I HAD CERTAIN
EXPECTATIONS.

05:36.804 --> 05:41.074
I CANNOT HELP WHAT
YOUR EXPECTATIONS WERE.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.811
I THINK YOU CAN.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.680
I THINK WE'RE FINISHED.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.683
WE'RE NOT FINISHED.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.720
LOOK, THERE IS
NO MERCHANDISE.

05:52.753 --> 05:53.954
YOU MADE
IMPLICATIONS.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.923
IMPLICATIONS ARE
NOT CONTRACTS.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.758
BUT I HAD
CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.793
ALL RIGHT!
THAT'S IT, ENOUGH!

05:59.827 --> 06:01.061
IF I HEAR YOU
RAMBLE ANY MORE

06:01.094 --> 06:03.564
ABOUT IMPLICATIONS
OR EXPECTATIONS

06:03.597 --> 06:05.466
I SWEAR I WILL
SNAP YOU IN HALF

06:05.499 --> 06:09.169
AND EAT YOU!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!

06:09.202 --> 06:10.804
I UNDERSTAND.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.840
GOOD!

06:13.774 --> 06:15.909
LET'S GO EAT.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.848
WHERE'D
THAT COME FROM?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.817
IT WARMED ME ALL OVER
TO SEE DAD THAT WAY.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.786
IT'S LIKE HE WAS...

06:25.819 --> 06:27.855
ALIVE.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.089
I WAS STARVIN'!

06:29.122 --> 06:33.427
OH, HULK GET HUNGRY,
HULK SMASH PEOPLE!

06:33.461 --> 06:37.698
OH, SURE, MAKE FUN
OF THE HYPOGLYCEMIC.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.703
HEY, ARE YOU WASTED?

06:43.904 --> 06:44.938
NO.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.107
'CAUSE MOM AND DAD SAID
YOU AND DEAN WERE DRINKING.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.610
UHH! WE WERE
NOT DRINKING!

06:49.643 --> 06:51.211
BUT, OF COURSE,
THEY DON'T
BELIEVE ME.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.780
NOBODY BELIEVES ME.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.848
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.551
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.520
WELL, DO YOU WANNA,
LIKE, PRACTICE
YOUR STORY ON ME

06:59.553 --> 07:02.556
SO IT'S MORE BELIEVABLE
WHEN YOU TELL MOM AND DAD?

07:02.590 --> 07:04.992
OH, I DON'T NEED
TO PRACTICE!

07:05.025 --> 07:05.859
IT'S ALL THE TRUTH.

07:05.893 --> 07:09.029
THAT'S GOOD,
THAT SOUNDS VERY BELIEVABLE.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.565
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE!

07:11.599 --> 07:12.700
YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

07:12.733 --> 07:16.003
THIS STARTED OUT
AS THE MOST AMAZING
NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.959
LILY.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.128
I DON'T BELIEVE
I'VE MET YOUR FRIEND.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.663
IS HE AN OUTSIDER?

07:42.696 --> 07:44.965
UM, YEAH. HI--
HI, SISTER HELEN.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.967
THIS--THIS IS
DEAN PERAMOTTI.

07:47.000 --> 07:47.768
HEY.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.902
HE GOES LAGUARDIA.

07:48.936 --> 07:52.573
OH. A PUBLIC.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.908
SISTER HELEN IS
SO SMALL MINDED.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.678
SHE SAYS
THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO LOVE EVERYBODY,

07:57.711 --> 07:58.979
BUT IF YOU GO
TO PUBLIC SCHOOL

07:59.012 --> 08:00.781
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE A LOW LIFE.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.815
BUT I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED DEAN

08:01.849 --> 08:03.751
BECAUSE HE IS
A LOW LIFE.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.086
WELL, MAYBE AT FIRST,

08:06.119 --> 08:09.723
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHO HE REALLY IS.

08:09.757 --> 08:12.025
HE'S VERY SENSITIVE.

08:13.894 --> 08:17.965
SO, UM, DO YOU
WANT TO DANCE
OR HAVE A COOKIE?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.266
HOW ABOUT WE GO
MAKE OUT?

08:19.299 --> 08:21.735
WHOA, ARE YOU OK?

08:21.769 --> 08:25.038
I'M--I'M FINE.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.008
* YOU LEFT ME
WITH A NOTE *

08:28.041 --> 08:31.879
* WE WERE
JUST GOOD FRIENDS *

08:31.912 --> 08:33.180
* REALLY CAN'T PRETEND

08:33.213 --> 08:36.249
* DIDN'T MIND,
I WAS YOUNG *

08:36.283 --> 08:40.187
* MY LIFE HAD JUST BEGUN

08:40.220 --> 08:41.655
OH, HEY, LILY.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.891
BRAD.
YOU LOOK...

08:43.924 --> 08:45.659
YEAH!

08:45.693 --> 08:47.595
THANKS.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.563
SO ARE YOU, LIKE,
HERE ALONE?

08:49.597 --> 08:51.765
I'M WITH DEAN, BRAD.

08:51.799 --> 08:56.036
OH, HEY, I DIDN'T EVEN
SEE YOU THERE, MAN.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.004
NO PROBLEM.

08:57.037 --> 08:57.705
ARE YOU ALONE?

08:57.738 --> 09:00.641
ME? YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I'M STAG.

09:00.674 --> 09:01.975
I'M BACHELOR STYLE.

09:02.009 --> 09:05.345
IT GIVES ME A CHANCE
TO CHECK OUT
THE MERCHANDISE.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.881
MAYBE TAKE
SOME HOME, YOU KNOW?

09:07.915 --> 09:10.984
HEY, WELL THEN,
UM...BYE!

09:11.018 --> 09:11.719
HEY!

09:11.752 --> 09:13.654
* I GOT FRIENDS

09:13.687 --> 09:16.289
* I GOT LETTERS HERE
TO SEND *

09:16.323 --> 09:18.191
* I GOT TIME ON MY HANDS

09:18.225 --> 09:21.194
* YOU CANCELED
ALL MY PLANS *

09:21.228 --> 09:22.395
OH!

09:22.429 --> 09:27.367
EVERYWHERE I LOOKED
THERE WERE NUNS
AND PARENTS AND NERDS.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.136
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST GO
OUT TO THE DUMPSTERS

09:29.169 --> 09:31.238
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES?

09:31.271 --> 09:33.707
THAT'S NOT ROMANTIC,

09:33.741 --> 09:37.244
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

09:37.277 --> 09:39.947
I'VE GOT SOME EXPERIENCE.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.149
YEAH, EXPERIENCE
WATCHING PEOPLE,
PERV?

09:42.182 --> 09:45.385
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M JUST TRYING
TO LEARN, OK?

09:45.418 --> 09:50.758
OK. WELL,
EVENTUALLY WE FOUND
A MUCH BETTER PLACE.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.134
WHAT WAS THAT?

10:02.202 --> 10:03.637
IT'S A LIQUOR BOTTLE.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.072
WHO SNUCK THAT IN?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.140
WHO CARES?

10:10.811 --> 10:13.280
SISTER HELEN!

10:14.782 --> 10:16.950
OH, GOD.
OK, THAT'S NOT OURS.

10:16.984 --> 10:20.654
YEAH, WE LOOKED DOWN
AND WE JUST FOUND IT
ON THE FLOOR.

10:20.688 --> 10:21.922
OK, THAT'S ENOUGH
FROM YOU.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.323
NO, NO, NO. REALLY,
LOOK, IT'S EMPTY.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.993
WELL, GOOD
TO THE LAST DROP.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.661
LOOK, IT'S NOT OURS!

10:27.695 --> 10:30.230
I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH,
MISTER.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.733
YOU ARE BANNED.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.434
UHH,
AND SHE BANNED HIM!

10:34.467 --> 10:36.369
AND NOW I'M NEVER
GONNA BE ABLE
TO TAKE HIM

10:36.403 --> 10:38.839
TO HOMECOMING
OR BASKETBALL GAMES

10:38.872 --> 10:40.040
OR THE EASTER
CARNIVAL,

10:40.073 --> 10:40.874
OR THE WALKATHON.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.442
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

10:42.475 --> 10:43.711
I BELIEVE YOU.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.212
I DON'T CARE.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.714
HEY, YOU KNOW
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS?

10:46.747 --> 10:48.248
THE PROBLEM'S ALL
THIS UPTIGHTNESS

10:48.281 --> 10:50.050
ABOUT UNDERAGE DRINKING.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.052
THERE ARE LAWS,
EDDIE.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.355
WHICH IS WHAT
MAKES KIDS REBEL
AND WANT TO DRINK.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.124
YOU LET 'EM DRINK
ALL THEY WANT,

10:57.157 --> 11:00.360
AND THEY WON'T
DRINK AT ALL.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.029
MOM, DAD, LOOK,
ALL RIGHT?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.931
I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAYS,

11:03.964 --> 11:05.999
DEAN AND I DID NOT
DRINK AT THAT DANCE.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.001
LOOK, LILY,
SISTER HELEN
SHOWED US THE BOTTLE.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.037
ALL RIGHT?
THE EMPTY BOTTLE
OF SCOTCH.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.171
SO WHAT DOES THAT PROVE?

11:11.204 --> 11:14.875
THAT BOTTLE WAS HALF-FULL
AN HOUR BEFORE.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.180
AND HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT?

11:20.213 --> 11:22.049
BECAUSE IT WAS OURS.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.686
HOW'S THAT SOUP,
MY MAN?

11:29.890 --> 11:30.924
IT WAS YOUR BOTTLE?

11:30.958 --> 11:33.193
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHOSE BOTTLE IT WAS.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.261
YES, IT DOES!
NO, IT DOESN'T.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.428
THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS IS

11:35.462 --> 11:36.930
THAT YOU'RE
TOO YOUNG TO DRINK.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.331
I DIDN'T, YOU DID!

11:38.365 --> 11:40.333
GO TO YOUR ROOM!

11:40.367 --> 11:41.468
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.738
NO, YOU'RE NOT!
YOU GET YOUR BUTT
BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!

11:44.772 --> 11:47.741
FINE. NOW WHAT?

11:47.775 --> 11:48.375
GO TO YOUR ROOM!

11:48.408 --> 11:49.877
THAT'S WHERE I WAS GOING!

11:49.910 --> 11:50.978
NO, YOU WEREN'T!

11:53.046 --> 11:55.182
EXCELLENT PARENTING.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.250
I'M GONNA GO
TALK TO HER.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.419
OH! CRIMINEY! AAH!

11:59.452 --> 12:00.888
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, DAD?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.990
OH, I THREW MY BACK OUT
DEALING WITH SOME

12:03.023 --> 12:04.491
OF YOUR BROTHER'S
ASSOCIATES.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.793
WAIT, I THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST ONE GUY.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.796
I HAVE NUMEROUS ASSOCIATES.

12:11.799 --> 12:15.335
THAT DISPLAY OF POWER
WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.471
YEAH, YEAH,
JUST GET ME MY PIZZA.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.274
COMING RIGHT UP.

12:23.210 --> 12:27.280
WELL, WELL, WELL,
IF IT ISN'T JOEY.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.949
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
FINNERTY?

12:28.982 --> 12:29.950
WHAT DO I WANT?

12:29.983 --> 12:32.419
HE WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT I WANT.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.153
YOU KNOW
WHAT I WANT.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.855
I WANT WHAT I GOT
COMING TO ME.

12:34.888 --> 12:35.889
I DON'T OWE YOU CRAP.

12:35.923 --> 12:40.227
NOW NOT ONLY AM I
NOT GETTING WHAT I WANT,

12:40.260 --> 12:43.530
I'M GETTING SOMETHING
THAT I DON'T WANT:

12:43.563 --> 12:45.032
THE RUNAROUND.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.499
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

12:46.533 --> 12:47.534
WHAT AM I GONNA
DO ABOUT IT?

12:47.567 --> 12:50.203
SEE THAT GUY OVER THERE?

12:52.372 --> 12:53.073
YEAH?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.942
HE'S GOT A BIG PROBLEM
WITH YOU.

12:54.975 --> 12:59.412
OH, YEAH? WELL,
HE CAN KISS MY ASS.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.382
WHAT, ARE YOU
TALKING TO ME?

13:02.415 --> 13:04.885
YEAH,
HE'S TALKING TO YOU.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.155
AAH!

13:08.188 --> 13:10.223
OHH!

13:10.257 --> 13:11.992
YAH!

13:12.025 --> 13:13.961
BRING IT ON!

13:20.300 --> 13:23.070
AAH!

13:26.506 --> 13:28.341
BEHIND YOU, DAD.

13:35.548 --> 13:39.987
DOES ANYBODY ELSE
WANT A PIECE OF ME?

13:40.020 --> 13:41.421
WHOA, DAD!

13:41.454 --> 13:42.355
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.225
EASE UP, GUY.
THERE'S A LOT
OF FREE PIZZA

13:45.258 --> 13:48.128
IN YOUR FUTURE
IF YOU PLAY
YOUR CARDS RIGHT.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.899
PUT A SOCK IN IT
OR I'LL DROP YA.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.366
OOH.

13:53.400 --> 13:57.204
UHH! LILY, WE ARE
NOT BLAMING YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

13:57.237 --> 13:58.605
IT'S THAT BOY
YOU WERE WITH.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.874
I COULD SAY
THE SAME THING TO YOU.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.076
OK, ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.245
ALL RIGHT,
WE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING SO WRONG.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.980
YOU BROUGHT BOOZE
TO MY DANCE.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.016
NO, WE DIDN'T.
YES, YOU DID.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.250
NO, WE DIDN'T!

14:10.283 --> 14:11.584
YES, YOU DID.

14:11.618 --> 14:15.622
OK, OK, WE DID.
BUT NOT TONIGHT.

14:15.655 --> 14:19.993
HEY, MR. FINNERTY,
CAN I CUT IN?

14:20.027 --> 14:22.062
NO.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.564
CAN--CAN YOU TELL LILY
TO DANCE WITH ME?

14:24.597 --> 14:26.433
NO.

14:26.934 --> 14:31.404
WHY'D I PAY $1.00
TO GET IN HERE? GOD!

14:31.438 --> 14:34.607
"MR. FINNERTY,
CAN YOU TELL LILY
TO DANCE WITH ME?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.309
WHY'D I PAY $1.00
TO GET IN--"

14:36.343 --> 14:37.677
SHH, BE NICE.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.412
REMEMBER WHEN WE USED
TO COME TO THESE DANCES,

14:39.446 --> 14:41.581
YOU WERE JUST
AS DORKY AS BRAD.

14:41.614 --> 14:42.515
OH, REALLY?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.484
I KIND OF REMEMBER
THAT I WAS
PRETTY SUAVE.

14:44.517 --> 14:48.121
WANNA GO BEHIND
THE STAGE
AND GET WASTED?

14:48.155 --> 14:50.890
YEAH.

14:54.694 --> 14:55.562
YES!

14:55.595 --> 14:58.531
ALL RIGHT!

14:59.166 --> 15:00.700
AAH!

15:00.733 --> 15:04.204
OH, BABY, THAT'S SMOOTH,
JUST LIKE WATER.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.407
YUMMY.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.976
OH, GOD, YOU'RE COOL.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.045
MMM!

15:12.079 --> 15:13.913
WHO'S BACK HERE?

15:16.984 --> 15:18.118
STASH THE BOTTLE!

15:18.151 --> 15:20.120
I DON'T--

15:27.627 --> 15:30.730
OH, MY GOD. DO YOU THINK
THAT BOTTLE'S STILL THERE?

15:30.763 --> 15:32.699
NAH, NO WAY.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.602
LET'S GO AND LOOK.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.637
COME ON.

15:38.538 --> 15:42.109
YES! YES! YES!

15:46.479 --> 15:48.348
OOH, SHALL WE?

15:48.381 --> 15:49.716
BUT OF COURSE.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.023
AAH! IT'S STILL SMOOTH.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.992
MMM! YUMMY.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.294
OH, STILL WILD.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.764
IS SOMEBODY BACK THERE?
SEAN!

16:04.797 --> 16:07.367
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.672
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS!

16:12.705 --> 16:16.476
YOU GUYS DO REALIZE
THAT THE WORD
"CHAPERONE"

16:16.509 --> 16:19.779
DOES NOT MEAN LEAD
THE DEBAUCHERY?

16:19.812 --> 16:22.282
YOU GUYS NEED
TO UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING, OK?

16:22.315 --> 16:23.783
WE NEVER HAVE ANY FUN!

16:23.816 --> 16:24.751
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

16:24.784 --> 16:28.021
YEAH, ME AND DAD
COME OVER HERE
ALL THE TIME.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.257
YEAH, I KNOW!
OK, AND THAT'S
THE PROBLEM

16:30.290 --> 16:30.990
BECAUSE WE--WE--

16:31.024 --> 16:33.260
NEVER HAVE A NIGHT
TO OURSELVES.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.395
AND TONIGHT, OK,
TONIGHT WE THOUGHT

16:35.428 --> 16:39.199
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT ONE
OF THOSE NIGHTS.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.667
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
MADE IT INTO A NIGHT

16:40.700 --> 16:41.668
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

16:41.701 --> 16:42.602
Scottish accent:
OH, THAT'S RIGHT,
A WEE LASSIE

16:42.635 --> 16:46.173
NEVER FORGETS
THE FIRST TIME
SHE CHUGS DOWN

16:46.206 --> 16:49.542
A BOTTLE
OF THE GLENDRONACH!

16:49.576 --> 16:51.644
WE DIDN'T
CHUG DOWN ANYTHING!

16:51.678 --> 16:52.612
GLENDRONACH?

16:52.645 --> 16:53.413
YEAH, WHO DID?

16:53.446 --> 16:55.715
20-YEAR-OLD
GOLD LABEL
GLENDRONACH?

16:55.748 --> 16:58.251
YEAH, DAD,
I THINK SO.

16:58.285 --> 17:03.090
DID YOU TAKE THAT OUT
OF MY LIQUOR CABINET?

17:06.193 --> 17:08.195
NO.

17:09.262 --> 17:12.099
OH, COME ON, WALT,
THAT WAS HIGH SCHOOL.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.400
THAT WAS SO LONG AGO.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.468
I DON'T CARE
HOW LONG AGO IT WAS,

17:15.502 --> 17:18.571
THAT BOTTLE
OF SCOTCH WAS
A BIRTHDAY PRESENT

17:18.605 --> 17:20.273
FROM MY UNCLE PETE.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.209
EVERY TIME
I TURNED MY BACK,

17:22.242 --> 17:23.810
YOU AND YOUR ROTTEN
BROTHER

17:23.843 --> 17:25.812
WERE STEALING
BOTTLES FROM MY BAR.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.347
NO, NO,
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

17:27.380 --> 17:28.748
YEAH, WE WOULD
ONLY DRINK A LITTLE.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.517
THEN WE'D TOP IT OFF
WITH SOME WATER,

17:30.550 --> 17:31.718
AND THEN WE'D PUT IT BACK.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.726
HEY, MR. FINNERTY,
IS LILY HERE?

17:39.759 --> 17:41.728
YEAH, YEAH, BRAD.
SHE'S RIGHT--

17:41.761 --> 17:42.762
ARE YOU OK?

17:42.795 --> 17:45.832
YEAH! I'M FINE.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.602
BRAD, ARE YOU DRUNK?

17:49.636 --> 17:51.738
YEAH, YEAH, I'M DRUNK.

17:51.771 --> 17:55.508
AND I'M NOT SORRY
FOR IT, EITHER.

17:55.542 --> 17:56.843
I'M SO SORRY, LILY.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.479
BRAD, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:59.512 --> 18:01.248
YOU AND THAT DEAN GUY,

18:01.281 --> 18:03.783
DANCING,
I WAS WATCHING YOU.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.120
HE'S VERY HANDSOME.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.795
OW!

18:48.828 --> 18:52.432
THAT'S MY DANCING FOOT!

18:57.270 --> 19:01.608
WE DON'T NEED WOMEN
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.244
WE'VE GOT
EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

19:04.277 --> 19:05.178
All: RIGHT!

19:05.212 --> 19:07.547
RIGHT?
RIGHT!

19:07.580 --> 19:09.682
Claudia: OH, HEY, BRAD.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.419
HEY, IS THIS WHERE
ALL THE COOL GUYS
ARE HANGING OUT?

19:12.452 --> 19:17.224
UM, NO, THEY'RE RIGHT
OVER THERE, MR. FINNERTY.

19:23.296 --> 19:26.199
Lily: WHAT WAS THAT?

19:26.899 --> 19:28.368
IT'S A LIQUOR BOTTLE.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.736
WHO SNUCK THAT IN?

19:29.769 --> 19:31.804
WHO CARES?

19:35.608 --> 19:36.976
SEE, IT WAS
ALL MY FAULT.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.211
Claudia: NOT EXACTLY.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.613
LOOK, LILY,
WE ARE SO SORRY.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.215
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

19:42.249 --> 19:45.985
WELL, THE BOTTLE
WAS OURS. IT WAS
CLAUDIA'S AND MINE.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.687
YOU--YOU--

19:47.720 --> 19:51.591
YOU'RE THE COOLEST PARENTS
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!

19:51.891 --> 19:54.361
OH, YEAH. YEAH,
THEY'RE REAL COOL.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.828
OH, COME ON.
WE FEEL TERRIBLE.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.898
WELL, MAYBE NEXT TIME
I TELL YOU THAT I DIDN'T
DO SOMETHING,

19:58.931 --> 19:59.799
YOU'LL BELIEVE ME.

19:59.832 --> 20:00.933
WELL, THAT WOULD BE FINE
IF YOU DIDN'T LIE

20:00.967 --> 20:03.270
YOUR BUTT OFF
ALL THE TIME.

20:03.736 --> 20:04.837
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING HOME.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.005
COME ON,
I'LL GIVE YOU
A RIDE, DAD.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.808
OH, I GOTTA STOP
AND SEE THIS GUY
FIRST.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.311
FINE, AS LONG
AS IT'S QUICK.

20:11.344 --> 20:15.482
HEY, IT'S ENTIRELY
UP TO YOU, MY MAN.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.949
I AM NOT YOUR MAN!

20:16.983 --> 20:19.952
BRAD, WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME
AND SLEEP IT OFF?

20:19.986 --> 20:22.755
HEY, LILY, DO YOU
THINK I COULD SPEND
THE NIGHT HERE?

20:22.789 --> 20:23.890
I DON'T THINK
I'M IN ANY SHAPE

20:23.923 --> 20:24.924
TO DRIVE HOME
RIGHT NOW.

20:24.957 --> 20:28.895
OK, OK, BRAD,
YOU DON'T HAVE A CAR,

20:28.928 --> 20:31.931
AND YOU LIVE
NEXT DOOR, OK?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.269
OHH!

20:36.303 --> 20:37.937
BLECCH!

20:37.970 --> 20:41.240
Brad: I'M SORRY!
I WAS DRUNK!

20:42.875 --> 20:44.511
SHH, SHH.

20:44.544 --> 20:45.745
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

20:45.778 --> 20:47.947
WHAT?
LISTEN.

20:48.848 --> 20:49.549
I DON'T HEAR
ANYTHING.

20:49.582 --> 20:54.354
EXACTLY, BECAUSE
WE'RE ALL ALONE.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.797

21:04.831 --> 21:08.000
* I'VE TRAVELED TOO FAR

21:08.034 --> 21:12.639
* TO CHANGE
THIS LONELY LIFE *

21:12.672 --> 21:15.308
Jimmy yelling:

21:15.342 --> 21:19.879
Henry: HE WAS SAYING
HE WAS A GHOST!

21:19.912 --> 21:20.947
SING LOUDER.

21:20.980 --> 21:25.618
Foreigner sings: * I WANT
TO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS *

21:25.652 --> 21:31.324
* AND I WANT YOU
TO SHOW ME *

21:31.358 --> 21:34.627
* I WANNA FEEL

21:37.597 --> 21:39.599
SINCE WHEN DOES
SISTER HELEN GET
TO PUNISH PARENTS?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.734

21:43.936 --> 21:45.572
HEY, I WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE FOR BEING

21:45.605 --> 21:46.673
SO IRRESPONSIBLE
LAST NIGHT.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.775
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I WAS PRETTY DRUNK.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.377

ANYTHING STUPID?

21:50.410 --> 21:52.979
