WEBVTT

00:06.337 --> 00:09.609
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.441
JOE!

00:11.442 --> 00:13.413
- YOU'RE A GUY.
- YES.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.545
AND I NEVER GET TIRED
OF HEARING THAT.

00:15.546 --> 00:16.716
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR IDEA

00:16.717 --> 00:18.788
OF THE MOST AWESOME
BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER?

00:18.789 --> 00:22.152
UM, A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE "SINGLE
MALT SCOTCH OF THE MONTH CLUB"

00:22.153 --> 00:24.495
HAND DELIVERED BY KATE
UPTON ON A 60-FOOT YACHT.

00:26.197 --> 00:28.528
SOMEONE HAS GIVEN THIS
WAY TOO MUCH THOUGHT.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.630
OKAY, NO NO NO NO NO.
THIS GIFT IS FOR ZANDER.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.632
SEE, HE'S TURNING 18 NEXT WEEK,

00:32.633 --> 00:34.504
AND I WANNA GET HIM
THE MOST PERSONAL,

00:34.505 --> 00:35.765
MOST UNIQUE GIFT EVER.

00:35.766 --> 00:38.138
OOH! YOU CAN GET HIM A
CUSTOM-MADE WAFFLE IRON

00:38.139 --> 00:39.609
THAT MAKES WAFFLES
WITH YOUR NAME ON THEM

00:39.610 --> 00:41.311
OR YOUR FAMILY CREST.

00:41.312 --> 00:43.144
THE BURKE FAMILY HAS A
RABBIT WEARING A HELMET.

00:44.515 --> 00:46.177
AND I'VE GIVEN IT
TOO MUCH THOUGHT?

00:47.518 --> 00:49.479
I'M GONNA STICK WITH
MY ORIGINAL IDEA.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.821
I'M GIVING HIM SOMETHING
REALLY SPECIAL AND PERSONAL

00:51.822 --> 00:53.423
HE'LL REMEMBER FOREVER.

00:53.424 --> 00:54.785
( both chuckle )

01:00.391 --> 01:02.492
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ABOUT?

01:02.493 --> 01:04.634
THAT WAS INCEPTION, BABY.

01:04.635 --> 01:06.697
YEAH, THAT WAFFLE IRON
IS AS GOOD AS MINE.

01:07.698 --> 01:09.068
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!

01:09.069 --> 01:10.200
( stammering ) WHAT
LENNOX JUST SAID

01:10.201 --> 01:11.671
ABOUT GIVING ZANDER
SOMETHING PERSONAL,

01:11.672 --> 01:13.503
SPECIAL, SOMETHING HE'LL REMEMBER
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

01:13.504 --> 01:15.505
WAS THAT... WHAT THAT CODE FOR,

01:15.506 --> 01:17.677
YOU KNOW, HER, UM...

01:17.678 --> 01:19.709
PRECIOUS FLOWER?

01:19.710 --> 01:21.511
WOULD YOU CALM DOWN?

01:21.512 --> 01:22.812
HEY, I AM CALM, ALL RIGHT?

01:22.813 --> 01:24.514
I AM TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL.
( laughs )

01:24.515 --> 01:25.786
YEAH, YOU'RE DRINKING HOT SAUCE.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.361
( high-pitched ) I MEANT TO.

01:31.722 --> 01:33.523
( coughs ) AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:33.524 --> 01:36.366
ACTUALLY, THAT SEARING IN MY
MOUTH HAS JUST GIVEN ME AN IDEA.

01:36.367 --> 01:38.268
ZANDER'S ABOUT TO
TURN 18, RIGHT?

01:38.269 --> 01:40.270
- IF YOU LET HIM.
- OKAY. OKAY.

01:40.271 --> 01:42.402
SO AS SOON AS ZANDER
HITS THAT MAGIC NUMBER,

01:42.403 --> 01:43.873
ANYTHING HE'S PLANNING
ON DOING WITH LENNOX,

01:43.874 --> 01:45.535
WHO'S A MINOR, GOES
FROM FUN TO FELONY.

01:45.536 --> 01:48.538
SO ALL I HAVE TO DO IS KEEP
HIM EXHAUSTED AND OCCUPIED

01:48.539 --> 01:50.380
FOR THE NEXT FIVE DAYS, WHICH MEANS...
( chuckles )

01:50.381 --> 01:54.545
I AM GONNA BE ON HIM LIKE
YOUR MOUTH ON A WINE GLASS.

01:56.387 --> 01:57.687
OKAY, RELAX, JOE.

01:57.688 --> 01:59.689
LENNOX AND I SHARE A
SPECIAL WOMANLY BOND.

01:59.690 --> 02:01.691
IF ANYTHING WERE ON THE VERGE OF
HAPPENING I WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT,

02:01.692 --> 02:03.523
BECAUSE LENNOX WOULD
HAVE TOLD ME.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.225
YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT'S EVERY
TEENAGE GIRL'S FAVORITE PART

02:05.226 --> 02:07.297
ABOUT LOSING HER VIRGINITY, IS
GIVING HER AUNT THE HEADS-UP.

02:07.298 --> 02:08.428
YOU KNOW? ( chuckles )

02:08.429 --> 02:10.601
"YO, AUNT. CHECK IT. I'M
ABOUT TO WRECK IT."

02:15.236 --> 02:19.710
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME ♪

02:23.914 --> 02:25.375
SO WHY ARE WE STOPPING HERE?

02:25.376 --> 02:26.676
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME TO
GIVE YOU A PERSONAL TOUR

02:26.677 --> 02:28.748
OF THE STIEGLITZ
RETROSPECTIVE AT THE MUSEUM.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.722
DUDE, DO I LOOK LIKE I
WANNA SEE YOUR STIEGLITZ?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.184
GET IN HERE.

02:34.185 --> 02:35.425
NO, THIS IS A LITTLE

02:35.426 --> 02:38.428
EARLY BIRTHDAY PRESENT, YOU
ALMOST-LEGAL ADULT, YOU.

02:38.429 --> 02:40.461
( chuckles ) SURPRISE.

02:41.392 --> 02:42.663
YOU'RE LOCKING ME IN A CAGE.

02:44.335 --> 02:45.466
OH, IF ONLY IT WAS THAT EASY.

02:47.238 --> 02:49.369
NO. ZANDER...

02:49.370 --> 02:51.372
YOU KNOW, I'VE JUST
BEEN THINKING, MAN.

02:53.304 --> 02:55.306
YOU AND LENNOX HAVE BEEN, UH,
DATING FOR A WHILE NOW, RIGHT?

02:57.278 --> 02:58.908
AND YOU TWO GUYS HAVE
BECOME QUITE CLOSE.

02:58.909 --> 03:01.281
( chuckles )

03:01.282 --> 03:02.952
I WANT YOU AND ME
TO BE THAT CLOSE.

03:02.953 --> 03:05.485
YOU KNOW, I WANNA GET TO
KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.557
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UH...

03:07.558 --> 03:08.619
WHAT TERRIFIES YOU.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.463
WHAT YOUR THRESHOLD FOR PAIN IS.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.868
ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE UP, STIEGLITZ.

03:18.869 --> 03:21.532
- UH, STIEGLITZ WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER...
- I DON'T CARE.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.241
- ISN'T THIS FUN?
- NO.

03:31.242 --> 03:32.712
GREAT. GREAT.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.783
ALL RIGHT. HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:33.784 --> 03:34.944
TOMORROW NIGHT... YOU AND ME...

03:34.945 --> 03:36.416
WE'RE GONNA BE PLAYING
A LITTLE BASKETBALL.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.547
OH! AND THE NIGHT AFTER THAT...

03:37.548 --> 03:38.818
GOT US HOCKEY TICKETS, BUDDY.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.320
UM... UH...

03:40.321 --> 03:42.452
- DON'T SAY NO.
- OKAY.

03:42.453 --> 03:43.823
THAT DOESN'T REALLY LEAVE
ME A WHOLE LOT OF TIME

03:43.824 --> 03:44.824
TO SPEND WITH LENNOX.

03:44.825 --> 03:45.995
HUH.

03:45.996 --> 03:47.328
HOW ABOUT THAT.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.500
OW! OHH!

03:50.501 --> 03:51.802
OKAY, I THINK WE'RE WARMED UP.

03:53.003 --> 03:54.864
NOW LET'S TRY SOME
FAST ONES, HUH?

03:54.865 --> 03:56.536
- ( dial clicks )
- ACTUALLY, I COULD USE SOME ICE, YOU KNOW...

03:56.537 --> 03:57.868
( laughs )

04:00.441 --> 04:01.771
OH, NO.

04:01.772 --> 04:03.773
THERE WE GO. NO NO NO NO NO NO.

04:03.774 --> 04:05.315
STAY IN THERE, OKAY?

04:05.316 --> 04:07.016
'CAUSE THE MACHINE CAN SENSE FEAR.
GO.

04:07.017 --> 04:08.018
( mouths )

04:10.881 --> 04:15.425
SO KEIRA, FOR THE LAST ONE
I GOT TWO-X EQUALS "X."

04:15.426 --> 04:16.456
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.588
( sighs ) RYDER, REALLY?

04:18.589 --> 04:21.391
WHO CAN THINK ABOUT MATH WHEN
I JUST LEARNED THE TRUTH?

04:21.392 --> 04:22.532
THE WHAT?

04:22.533 --> 04:25.335
I FOUND OUT WHY YOU WERE
SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL.

04:25.336 --> 04:27.767
- UH...
- FOR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY?

04:27.768 --> 04:31.341
( sighs ) UM, THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
I REALLY WANNA TALK ABOUT.

04:31.342 --> 04:32.802
I WISH YOU WOULD.

04:32.803 --> 04:34.804
OKAY. I COULD TALK
ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT.

04:34.805 --> 04:36.476
( clears throat )

04:36.477 --> 04:38.448
I'VE BEEN HOMESCHOOLED
MY WHOLE LIFE, AND...

04:38.449 --> 04:40.450
I'VE NEVER MET ANYBODY
WHO HAD DETENTION,

04:40.451 --> 04:43.454
MUCH LESS SUSPENDED
FOR MARIJUANA.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.317
YOU'RE SO DANGEROUS.

04:47.318 --> 04:49.589
EVEN YOUR MOUTH LOOKS DANGEROUS.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.592
IT'S... IT'S NOT.
I JUST BRUSHED.

04:54.365 --> 04:56.366
( rooster crows )

04:56.367 --> 04:58.369
OH, FIDDLESTICKS!

05:00.471 --> 05:03.433
- THAT'S MY ALARM.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

05:03.434 --> 05:06.005
MY MOMS ARE SUPER-STRICT ABOUT
STARTING FAMILY MEALS ON TIME,

05:06.006 --> 05:08.008
AND I'M NOT WILLING
TO BREAK THE RULES.

05:09.580 --> 05:11.981
♪ UNLIKE YOU ♪

05:11.982 --> 05:14.043
DON'T FORGET WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

05:14.044 --> 05:15.886
I'LL BE REMEMBERING
IT ALL NIGHT.

05:18.088 --> 05:19.589
- HEY, BRO.
- ( door closes )

05:19.590 --> 05:21.621
YOU'RE LOOKING MORE
CONFUSED THAN USUAL.

05:21.622 --> 05:24.654
KEIRA JUST SAID THAT SHE
LOVED THAT I'M A BAD BOY.

05:24.655 --> 05:27.457
MAYBE SHE MEANT YOU'RE
BAD AT BEING A BOY.

05:27.458 --> 05:30.500
( chuckles ) SHE FOUND OUT WHY
I GOT SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL

05:30.501 --> 05:33.533
AND NOW SHE THINKS I'M SOME KIND OF
DANGEROUS CRIMINAL OR SOMETHING.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.034
YOU, DANGEROUS?

05:35.035 --> 05:36.866
THE ONE TIME YOU PLAYED
"GRAND THEFT AUTO"

05:36.867 --> 05:38.869
YOU UNIONIZED THE PROSTITUTES.

05:39.970 --> 05:41.471
WHAT DO I DO?

05:41.472 --> 05:43.473
SHE'S THE ONLY GIRL
IN MY SHRUNKEN...

05:43.474 --> 05:45.515
SOCIAL UNIVERSE. I
CAN'T BLOW THIS.

05:45.516 --> 05:47.346
WELL, IF KEIRA THINKS
YOU'RE A BAD BOY,

05:47.347 --> 05:49.649
MY GUESS IS YOU
BETTER BE A BAD BOY.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.822
SO LET'S SEE WHAT
WE CAN DO HERE.

06:00.891 --> 06:02.563
WHAT UP, DAWG?

06:07.097 --> 06:09.399
HEY, SO I JUST DROPPED
ZANDER OFF AT HOME.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.401
AFTER THREE HOURS OF PITCHES,
THE KID PRACTICALLY NEEDED

06:11.402 --> 06:13.002
A FULL-BODY ICE PACK. ( laughs )

06:13.003 --> 06:15.675
I THINK HE WAS CRYING.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.507
UH, JOE, TAKE A LOOK.

06:17.508 --> 06:19.679
LENNOX POSTED THIS ON HER
BLOG A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.852
I JUST SAW IT NOW.
READ THE TITLE.

06:22.853 --> 06:24.855
"WHY URINALS ARE
INHERENTLY SEXIST."

06:26.717 --> 06:28.518
NOT THAT ONE, THE NEXT ONE.

06:28.519 --> 06:29.860
"I LOST IT. SO WHAT?"

06:31.422 --> 06:33.593
NO. NO.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.496
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!

06:36.497 --> 06:39.629
"WHEN I LOST MY VIRGINITY, ALL
I LOST WAS MY MISCONCEPTION

06:39.630 --> 06:41.971
THAT HAVING SEX IS A BIG
LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE.

06:41.972 --> 06:44.133
IT'S NOT. DON'T
BELIEVE THE HYPE.

06:44.134 --> 06:45.605
JUST BECAUSE THE TWO
OF YOU GOT NAKED..."

06:45.606 --> 06:48.107
WILL YOU STOP READING?!
WILL YOU JUST STOP IT?!

06:48.108 --> 06:50.440
DAMN, MAN! I PUT ALL THIS TIME AND
ENERGY INTO PREVENTING THE CRIME,

06:50.441 --> 06:52.011
AND THE KID ALREADY
ROBBED THE BANK.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.685
I JUST FEEL AWFUL THAT LENNOX'S
SEX LIFE IS OFF TO A LOUSY START.

06:55.686 --> 06:57.617
SEX SHOULD BE FUN AND ENJOYABLE.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.789
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

06:59.790 --> 07:01.451
SEX IS BAD.

07:01.452 --> 07:03.593
SEX SHOULD BE SAD
AND HORRIBLE AND...

07:03.594 --> 07:04.754
SHAMEFUL.

07:04.755 --> 07:07.497
WELL, I'M SURE IT IS FOR
THE WOMEN YOU'RE WITH.

07:07.498 --> 07:09.499
BUT LENNOX DESERVES BETTER.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.800
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M
GONNA HELP MY NIECE

07:10.801 --> 07:12.462
HAVE A MORE REWARDING SEX LIFE.

07:12.463 --> 07:14.864
REWARDING SEX! WHAT
IS THIS, FRANCE?!

07:14.865 --> 07:17.507
OOH! I'VE GOT JUST
THE PERFECT THING.

07:17.508 --> 07:18.708
YOU C...

07:18.709 --> 07:20.711
HEY, DOES FOREVER 21
MAKE A CHASTITY BELT?

07:23.774 --> 07:24.844
"A GUIDE TO INTIMACY:

07:24.845 --> 07:26.847
THE SABRE AND THE LOTUS."

07:29.480 --> 07:31.781
A SEX MANUAL?! WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU GIVE LENNOX THAT?

07:31.782 --> 07:34.624
JOE, SHE'S ALREADY DOING IT.
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.455
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE'S STILL A CHANCE

07:36.456 --> 07:37.957
THAT IT CAN HIT AN ICEBERG
AND EVERYBODY WILL DROWN.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.560
WE CAN'T GIVE UP HOPE.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.862
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE. SO
NOW THE QUESTION IS:

07:42.863 --> 07:45.535
HOW ARE YOU GONNA HANDLE
LENNOX BEING SEXUALLY ACTIVE?

07:45.536 --> 07:46.996
GOOD OLD-FASHIONED DENIAL.

07:46.997 --> 07:48.838
YOU KNOW?

07:48.839 --> 07:51.841
'CAUSE, UH, IN HERE,
LENNOX IS GONNA BE THAT...

07:51.842 --> 07:53.643
THAT INNOCENT GIRL
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

07:53.644 --> 07:55.545
WHAT, YOU'VE ONLY KNOWN
HER SINCE SHE WAS 14.

07:55.546 --> 07:56.846
YEAH, A VERY INNOCENT 14, OKAY?

07:56.847 --> 07:58.809
NOT... NOT YOU 14.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.512
WHOA, HEY!

08:02.513 --> 08:04.515
I THOUGHT I INVENTED THAT.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.521
( knocks on door )

08:11.522 --> 08:13.793
HEY, LEN. WHAT'S UP?

08:13.794 --> 08:16.766
- NOTHIN'.
- SOUNDS FUN.

08:16.767 --> 08:17.927
UM... ( clears throat )

08:17.928 --> 08:19.268
YOU KNOW, SPEAKING OF FUN,

08:19.269 --> 08:20.900
I READ YOUR BLOG.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.202
YOU KNOW, THE ONE ABOUT, UM...

08:23.203 --> 08:25.004
ABOUT THE THING.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.505
THE, UH... ( exhales )

08:26.506 --> 08:27.777
FIRST TIME.

08:27.778 --> 08:30.239
( groaning ) OH, GOD.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.241
YEAH, I'M JUST KINDA CURIOUS

08:32.242 --> 08:34.113
WHY YOU HAD TO BLOG ABOUT
THAT TO THE WHOLE WORLD

08:34.114 --> 08:36.115
INSTEAD OF, YOU KNOW,

08:36.116 --> 08:38.247
COMING AND TALKING TO YOUR
GOOD OL' UNDERSTANDING

08:38.248 --> 08:39.919
AUNT MEL.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.591
MY BLOG IS FOR MY PEERS...

08:41.592 --> 08:43.923
OTHER GIRLS WHO MIGHT BE HAVING
SEX FOR THEIR FIRST TIME.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.925
AND, NO OFFENSE, BUT

08:45.926 --> 08:49.098
I HAVE A PRETTY STRONG
FEELING THAT'S NOT YOU.

08:49.099 --> 08:51.261
HEY, I'M NOT BLUE, BUT I
STILL ENJOYED "AVATAR."

08:52.803 --> 08:54.133
LOOK, IF YOU'RE GONNA
BE SEXUALLY ACTIVE,

08:54.134 --> 08:56.966
I THOUGHT YOU OUGHTA HAVE THIS.

08:56.967 --> 08:58.237
GEEZ, WHAT IS THIS?

08:58.238 --> 08:59.769
LIKE 10,000 CONDOMS?

08:59.770 --> 09:02.111
NO, YOU DON'T NEED CONDOMS;
YOU NEED INFORMATION.

09:02.112 --> 09:05.274
WELL, OF COURSE YOU NEED CONDOMS.
YOU NEED CONDOMS.

09:05.275 --> 09:08.678
BUT YOUR WHOLE POST WAS ABOUT HOW
NOTHING THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS.

09:08.679 --> 09:12.021
AND I DON'T WANT YOU GOING THROUGH
LIFE THINKING SEX IS JUST BLAH,

09:12.022 --> 09:14.183
WHEN IT COULD BE...

09:14.184 --> 09:16.156
PYOO PYOO! ANDALE ANDALE!
ARRIBA ARRIBA!

09:18.158 --> 09:20.559
WAS YOUR FIRST TIME
WITH SPEEDY GONZALEZ?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.232
SADLY, YES.

09:23.293 --> 09:26.095
( sarcastically ) OH, GOODY.
THE "HOW TO HAVE SEX" BOOK.

09:26.096 --> 09:28.768
AND YOU MARKED YOUR
FAVORITE PAGES.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.701
YES, AND I HIGHLIGHTED BITS
THAT ARE ESPECIALLY USEFUL.

09:31.702 --> 09:34.173
SEE, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
NOBODY TALKED TO ME ABOUT SEX.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.845
I HAD TO FIGURE IT
ALL OUT ON MY OWN.

09:35.846 --> 09:38.347
THAT REALLY DOESN'T SOUND
SO TERRIBLE RIGHT NOW.

09:38.348 --> 09:40.009
BELIEVE ME, IT WAS.

09:40.010 --> 09:41.580
YEAH, I AM TOTALLY SELF-TAUGHT.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.754
OKAY! WELL, IT IS SO NICE OF YOU

09:44.755 --> 09:47.056
TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN
MY SEX LIFE, AUNT MEL.

09:47.057 --> 09:48.187
AND THANK YOU FOR
THE LITERATURE.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.159
I WILL TREASURE IT ALWAYS.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.221
WELL, IF YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS...

09:52.222 --> 09:53.223
I'M GOOD.

09:56.226 --> 09:58.267
CONGRATULATE ME, JOE.

09:58.268 --> 09:59.929
"THE SABRE AND THE
LOTUS" WAS A BIG HIT.

09:59.930 --> 10:02.271
LENNOX SAID SHE REALLY
APPRECIATED IT.

10:02.272 --> 10:03.773
SHE DID, HUH? AH, THAT'S NICE.

10:03.774 --> 10:04.774
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

10:04.775 --> 10:06.776
NO... "THE SABRE AND THE LOTUS"?

10:06.777 --> 10:08.207
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

10:08.208 --> 10:09.338
IN THE GOODWILL BIN,
ALONG WITH A PAIR

10:09.339 --> 10:10.880
OF HER OLD SNEAKERS.

10:10.881 --> 10:13.043
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S
GONNA HELP THE HOMELESS.

10:14.184 --> 10:15.885
IT'S OFFICIAL:

10:15.886 --> 10:17.386
I HAVE OUTLIVED MY
USEFULNESS AS AN AUNT.

10:17.387 --> 10:19.920
NOW I'M JUST THE HOT WOMAN
WHO LIVES DOWN THE HALL.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.822
I'M NOT NEEDED ANYMORE!

10:22.823 --> 10:24.654
OH, COME ON NOW. STOP THAT.

10:24.655 --> 10:27.326
LENNOX STILL NEEDS YOU, YOU
KNOW, IN LOTS OF WAYS.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.298
NAME ONE.

10:28.299 --> 10:31.161
WELL, SHE STILL NEEDS YOUR...

10:32.202 --> 10:33.933
MONEY.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.705
THAT'S THE BEST YOU
CAN COME UP WITH?!

10:35.706 --> 10:37.266
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME A LOT
OF TIME, ALL RIGHT?!

10:37.267 --> 10:39.108
OOH, YOU TOOK HER TO
THE DENTIST ON MON...

10:39.109 --> 10:40.771
NO, THAT WAS ME.

10:43.013 --> 10:45.174
SO, UM, WANNA WATCH SOME TV?

10:45.175 --> 10:46.245
I CAN'T.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.277
I'M ONLY ALLOWED TO
WATCH PUBLIC TELEVISION

10:48.278 --> 10:50.120
MONDAY NIGHTS FROM 6:00 TO 6:30.

10:51.221 --> 10:53.222
WOW. OKAY.

10:53.223 --> 10:56.185
WELL, WE CAN STILL SIT
ON THE COUCH AND DO...

10:56.186 --> 10:57.687
YOU KNOW, COUCH STUFF.

10:57.688 --> 10:58.958
HEY, THERE'S A COUCH RIGHT HERE!

10:58.959 --> 11:00.791
( giggles )

11:04.334 --> 11:05.735
I BROUGHT MY DANGEROUS MOUTH.

11:05.736 --> 11:08.968
UM, FIRST I WANTED
TO HEAR MORE ABOUT

11:08.969 --> 11:10.970
YOUR CHECKERED PAST.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.302
I BET THE STORIES
ARE VERY EXCITING.

11:13.303 --> 11:15.304
RIGHT. YEAH. UH, STORIES...

11:15.305 --> 11:17.446
STORIES STORIES STORIES.

11:17.447 --> 11:19.148
THERE'S SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM.

11:19.149 --> 11:21.310
I... I REMEMBER THIS ONE TIME.

11:21.311 --> 11:23.983
I WORKED FOR A GANGSTER NAMED...

11:23.984 --> 11:26.155
P-PAULIE.

11:26.156 --> 11:28.417
PAULIE WALNUTS.

11:28.418 --> 11:30.089
GO ON.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.762
AND PAULIE HAD ME
COLLECTING PAYMENTS

11:32.763 --> 11:34.764
FOR THE DRUG... STORE.

11:34.765 --> 11:37.096
UM, THIS ONE TIME

11:37.097 --> 11:39.268
I HAD TO CONFRONT THESE
RIVAL DRUG DEALERS,

11:39.269 --> 11:42.271
TONY SOPRANO AND, UM...

11:42.272 --> 11:44.303
NUCKY THOMPSON.

11:44.304 --> 11:48.008
I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO SCARED.

11:51.982 --> 11:53.282
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

11:53.283 --> 11:56.015
THE PAST... WHEN I WAS NEEDED.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.847
HERE'S A WRISTBAND FROM
WHEN I TOOK LENNOX

11:57.848 --> 12:00.349
TO SEE A SMASH MOUTH CONCERT
WITHOUT HER MOTHER'S PERMISSION.

12:00.350 --> 12:02.491
AWW, AND THIS IS FROM WHEN I
TOOK HER TO SEE "ROCKY HORROR"

12:02.492 --> 12:04.194
WITHOUT HER MOTHER'S PERMISSION.

12:05.996 --> 12:07.456
( sighs ) BELLY
RING, BELLY RING...

12:07.457 --> 12:09.298
NIPPLE RING.

12:09.299 --> 12:11.300
OOH, THAT'S MINE.

12:11.301 --> 12:13.202
UHH! THIS IS FROM WHEN
WE DYED OUR HAIR BLUE

12:13.203 --> 12:14.764
WITHOUT HER MOTHER'S PERMISSION.

12:14.765 --> 12:17.166
DID YOU EVER DO ANYTHING WITH
HER MOTHER'S PERMISSION?

12:17.167 --> 12:19.008
NO! BECAUSE I WAS FUN AND COOL,

12:19.009 --> 12:20.339
AND NOW ALL THAT'S GONE.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.341
OHH, COME ON.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.743
PERK UP. HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.245
MADE YOUR FAVORITE SOUP.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.246
BUTTERNUT SQUASH?

12:27.247 --> 12:29.278
I MADE YOUR
SECOND-FAVORITE SOUP.

12:29.279 --> 12:31.882
- POTATO LEEK?
- I MADE YOU SOUP, OKAY!

12:33.223 --> 12:35.184
I'M NOT FEELING VERY
SOUPY JUST NOW,

12:35.185 --> 12:37.356
BUT IT MEANS A LOT TO ME
THAT YOU'RE HERE, JOE.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.928
AUNT MEL, I NEED TO TALK.

12:38.929 --> 12:41.161
- GET OUT, GET OUT, GET OUT!
- WAIT, CAN I...

12:42.863 --> 12:44.333
GO AHEAD, SWEETIE.

12:44.334 --> 12:46.996
TELL ME EVERYTHING. I
AM YOURS COMPLETELY.

12:46.997 --> 12:48.537
ZANDER BROKE UP WITH ME.

12:48.538 --> 12:50.369
OHH, HONEY.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.371
HE SAID HE DOESN'T
WANNA SEE ME ANYMORE.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.843
HE WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME.

12:53.844 --> 12:55.474
OHH, THAT'S AWFUL.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.847
WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I AM COOL AUNT MEL.

12:57.848 --> 13:00.350
I AM WARM AUNT MEL. I AM
ALL-TEMPERATURES AUNT MEL.

13:01.551 --> 13:03.212
DO YOU THINK THAT ZANDER
BREAKING UP WITH ME

13:03.213 --> 13:06.816
HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE FACT THAT HE AND I...

13:06.817 --> 13:08.287
DID IT?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.789
WELL, IT COULD. (
exhales deeply )

13:10.790 --> 13:12.291
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU
SAID IN YOUR BLOG,

13:12.292 --> 13:15.064
SEX DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY MAKE
THINGS GREAT BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE.

13:15.065 --> 13:16.525
SO HE GOES AROUND ALL LIKE,

13:16.526 --> 13:18.227
"OOH, I'M THIS
SENSITIVE ARTIST,"

13:18.228 --> 13:19.869
BUT THEN WHEN I SHARE THIS
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THING

13:19.870 --> 13:21.430
WITH HIM, HE DUMPS ME?

13:21.431 --> 13:23.572
WELL, THEN YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE!
I'M NEVER TALKING TO HIM AGAIN.

13:23.573 --> 13:25.234
AND IF YOU JUST HAPPEN TO
BE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET

13:25.235 --> 13:27.236
AND RUN HIM OVER,
I'M OKAY WITH THAT!

13:27.237 --> 13:29.038
OKAY, WAIT. LEN, OKAY...

13:29.039 --> 13:30.279
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

13:30.280 --> 13:34.313
BUT WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO HIM
BEFORE ANYONE RUNS HIM OVER?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.145
YOU SHOULDN'T JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS.

13:36.146 --> 13:38.317
I'M NOT JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.989
I'M JUST COMING TO THE
SUDDEN REALIZATION

13:39.990 --> 13:43.253
THAT ZANDER IS AN INCONSIDERATE,
SELFISH DOUCHE-NOZZLE!

13:46.096 --> 13:47.256
DID I HELP?

13:47.257 --> 13:48.398
WAS I HELPFUL?

13:51.261 --> 13:54.163
AND NOW LENNOX SAYS SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO SEE HIM ANYMORE.

13:54.164 --> 13:55.905
NOBODY TREATS MY
LITTLE GIRL LIKE THIS.

13:55.906 --> 13:57.907
BUT JOE, YOU'RE
NOT THE ENFORCER.

13:57.908 --> 13:59.268
YOU'RE THE CAREGIVER, THE NANNY.

13:59.269 --> 14:01.210
WELL, I'M GONNA NANNY THE
CRAP OUTTA THAT ZANDER.

14:01.211 --> 14:02.511
OKAY OKAY. WHY DOES EVERYONE

14:02.512 --> 14:03.943
IN THIS FAMILY MAKE
SNAP DECISIONS

14:03.944 --> 14:06.175
BASED ON NOTHING AND
THEN FLY OFF THE HANDLE?

14:06.176 --> 14:07.216
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE
HANDLE'S THERE FOR,

14:07.217 --> 14:09.448
IN CASE YOU NEED TO
FLY OFF OF SOMETHING.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.620
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN LENNOX AND ZANDER.

14:11.621 --> 14:12.982
YEAH, WE DO.

14:12.983 --> 14:15.084
HE HIT IT AND QUIT
IT, DIDN'T HE?

14:15.085 --> 14:16.926
WELL, YOU COULD
MAKE THAT ARGUMENT

14:16.927 --> 14:18.557
BASED ON THE FACT THAT HE DID...

14:18.558 --> 14:20.629
EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

14:20.630 --> 14:22.362
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA
DO ABOUT THAT?

14:23.563 --> 14:24.633
WELL?

14:24.634 --> 14:26.165
NANNY HIM, JOE.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.467
- NANNY HIM GOOD!
- YEAH.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.380
WELL WELL WELL.
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.213
LAST PLACE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I'D FIND
YOU IS WHERE YOU'VE CHOSEN TO HIDE.

14:44.214 --> 14:46.215
I'M NOT HIDING, OKAY?

14:46.216 --> 14:47.987
JUST DIDN'T WANNA RUN INTO
ANYBODY I KNOW RIGHT NOW.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.658
YEAH, WELL, UNFORTUNATELY
YOU KNOW ME.

14:49.659 --> 14:51.660
HERE. GO AHEAD.

14:51.661 --> 14:53.022
HIT ME.

14:53.023 --> 14:54.524
I'M JUST A PUNCHING
BAG FOR EVERYBODY.

14:56.166 --> 14:57.627
HEY, LOOK, I DIDN'T
COME HERE TO PUNCH...

14:59.369 --> 15:01.470
WELL, I'M GONNA START
OFF BY TALKING.

15:01.471 --> 15:04.373
- ABOUT WHAT YOU DID TO LENNOX.
- WHAT I DID TO LENNOX?

15:04.374 --> 15:05.534
WHAT ABOUT WHAT SHE DID TO ME?

15:05.535 --> 15:06.506
SHE PUT ALL OF OUR
PERSONAL BUSINESS

15:06.507 --> 15:08.278
OUT IN PUBLIC FOR THE
ENTIRE WORLD TO SEE.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.481
YOU DID IT IN PUBLIC?

15:12.482 --> 15:14.143
NO, THE THING SHE
WROTE ON HER BLOG.

15:14.144 --> 15:16.146
I READ IT LAST NIGHT AND
IT'S SO EMBARRASSING.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.387
THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME TOO.

15:18.388 --> 15:20.049
THAT WAS...

15:20.050 --> 15:21.490
THAT WAS YOUR FIRST...

15:21.491 --> 15:23.252
WOW.

15:23.253 --> 15:24.553
IT WAS THIS INCREDIBLY
MEANINGFUL THING

15:24.554 --> 15:26.925
JUST BETWEEN THE TWO OF
US, AND THEN SHE GOES OFF

15:26.926 --> 15:28.527
AND TELLS EVERYBODY
THAT IT WAS LOUSY.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.529
WELL, SHE DIDN'T... SHE
DIDN'T TELL EVERYBODY.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.531
IT'S ON HER BLOG,
HER FACEBOOK PAGE

15:32.532 --> 15:34.663
AND HER TWITTER.

15:34.664 --> 15:37.237
AND HOW DISAPPOINTING
I AM IS TRENDING.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.668
LOOK, UM... HEY, MAN,

15:39.669 --> 15:41.040
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

15:41.041 --> 15:43.312
EVERYBODY'S TERRIBLE AT
IT THEIR FIRST TIME.

15:43.313 --> 15:45.375
WELL, ACTUALLY NOT EVERYBODY.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.547
HOW COULD SHE DO THIS TO ME?

15:48.548 --> 15:51.380
I CARE ABOUT HER. I
REALLY CARE ABOUT HER.

15:51.381 --> 15:53.552
SHE'S MY WALLPAPER, AND
NOT JUST ON MY PHONE...

15:53.553 --> 15:55.225
ON MY LAPTOP TOO.

15:56.726 --> 15:58.258
I MEAN, I LOVE HER.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.460
YOU DO?

16:01.461 --> 16:02.531
YOU LOVE HER?

16:02.532 --> 16:04.193
YEAH.

16:04.194 --> 16:05.635
I THOUGHT SHE FELT THE
SAME WAY ABOUT ME.

16:06.636 --> 16:08.697
HEY, LOOK, MAN...

16:08.698 --> 16:11.100
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

16:11.101 --> 16:15.104
FOR SOME REASON WOMEN HAVE THIS BIOLOGICAL
URGE TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS.

16:15.105 --> 16:17.106
OKAY? ( stammering ) AND
THEY WILL JUST EXPRESS

16:17.107 --> 16:18.577
AND EXPRESS AND
EXPRESS AND EXPRESS

16:18.578 --> 16:20.409
TILL THEY EXPRESS YOUR
FRICKIN' EARS OFF.

16:20.410 --> 16:22.411
AND LENNOX BEING A
WRITER, I MEAN...

16:22.412 --> 16:24.053
SHE EXPRESSES HERSELF
EVEN MORE THAN THAT.

16:24.054 --> 16:26.055
OKAY, SO IT'S LIKE...

16:26.056 --> 16:28.387
IT'S LIKE HOW I WORK OUT STURM
UND DRANG IN MY ARTWORK.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.420
YOU KNOW, SHE'S A WRITER. THAT'S
HOW SHE PROCESSES THINGS, RIGHT?

16:32.322 --> 16:33.993
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, BUT...

16:35.495 --> 16:37.226
I DO KNOW THIS:

16:37.227 --> 16:39.628
WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE, SOMETIMES YOU
JUST GOTTA PLAY THROUGH THE HURT.

16:39.629 --> 16:42.332
AND IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT
HER LIKE YOU SAY YOU DO...

16:43.403 --> 16:45.504
THEN I THINK YOU GOTTA
GIVE HER A SECOND CHANCE.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.276
YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD
GO BACK TO HER.

16:47.277 --> 16:48.737
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER,
BUT MY LIPS ARE MOVING

16:48.738 --> 16:50.740
AND THOSE ARE THE WORDS
THAT ARE COMING OUT, YEAH.

16:52.082 --> 16:53.083
THANKS, JOE.

16:54.384 --> 16:55.544
YEAH.

16:55.545 --> 16:56.546
WHAT ARE YA...

16:58.448 --> 17:01.450
THIS IS REALLY NOT THE
TIME OR THE PLACE.

17:01.451 --> 17:03.021
THIS WAY? YEAH.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.524
( doorbell rings )

17:06.326 --> 17:08.557
- HEY, KEIRA.
- RYDER.

17:08.558 --> 17:10.399
YOU REMEMBER MY PARENTS?

17:10.400 --> 17:12.201
YES, OF COURSE. PLEASE COME IN,

17:12.202 --> 17:14.203
MRS., UH...

17:14.204 --> 17:15.364
LADIES... WOMEN...

17:15.365 --> 17:17.106
JUST PLEASE, COME IN.
HAVE A SEAT.

17:17.107 --> 17:20.209
WE JUST CAME TO TELL YOU THAT KEIRA'S
NO LONGER ALLOWED TO SEE YOU.

17:20.210 --> 17:21.510
WHAT? WHY?

17:21.511 --> 17:24.543
WE ONLY WATCHED 20 MINUTES
OF "DOWNTON ABBEY."

17:24.544 --> 17:27.116
WE FOUND OUT ABOUT
YOUR SORDID PAST.

17:27.117 --> 17:28.377
WHO TOLD YOU I HAD
A "SORDID PAST"?

17:28.378 --> 17:30.079
I DID. THEY'RE MY PARENTS.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.351
OF COURSE I TELL
THEM EVERYTHING.

17:33.183 --> 17:34.823
SO THIS IS IT, RYDER.

17:34.824 --> 17:36.525
GOOD-BYE.

17:36.526 --> 17:37.527
WE HAD A GOOD RUN.

17:39.429 --> 17:40.459
HOLD ON, WAIT!

17:40.460 --> 17:43.232
MRS. AND MRS. GUCKENHEIM-SCHAPP,

17:43.233 --> 17:44.593
HEAR ME OUT. HAVE A SEAT.

17:44.594 --> 17:47.096
( sighs )

17:47.097 --> 17:48.697
WE DIDN'T EVEN GET
TO FIRST BASE,

17:48.698 --> 17:50.739
AS I'M SURE SHE TOLD YOU.

17:50.740 --> 17:52.471
I DID.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.603
PLEASE, I JUST NEED ONE MINUTE.

17:54.604 --> 17:56.105
YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW
THE WHOLE STORY.

17:56.106 --> 17:57.746
RYDER, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO
BAMBOOZLE MY DAUGHTER,

17:57.747 --> 18:01.111
BUT I WENT TO SARAH LAWRENCE,
AND I KNOW A THING OR TWO.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.713
A BUDDY OF MINE BROUGHT A
JOINT ON AN OVERNIGHT TRIP.

18:04.714 --> 18:06.555
IT WAS MY FIRST TIME
EVEN TRYING POT.

18:06.556 --> 18:08.317
I TOOK A COUPLE PUFFS

18:08.318 --> 18:09.519
AND I THREW UP ON
MY FRIEND MITCH.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.492
THAT'S IT. I SWEAR
ON A STACK OF BIBLES

18:13.493 --> 18:16.165
OR CONSTITUTIONS OR
WHATEVER SACRED TEXT

18:16.166 --> 18:17.467
IS MEANINGFUL TO YOUR PEOPLE.

18:18.468 --> 18:20.599
FAMILY! I MEAN FAMILY!

18:20.600 --> 18:22.601
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE
OTHER STORIES?

18:22.602 --> 18:24.303
THE RUN-INS WITH THE LAW,

18:24.304 --> 18:27.506
COOKING METH WITH YOUR HIGH
SCHOOL CHEMISTRY TEACHER.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.508
THAT, UM...

18:29.509 --> 18:31.640
I MADE ALL THAT UP.

18:31.641 --> 18:34.484
I WAS TRYING TO IMPRESS KEIRA BY
PRETENDING TO BE A TOUGH GUY.

18:36.286 --> 18:38.116
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE I
KNOW WHO TRIED TO IMPRESS

18:38.117 --> 18:41.119
SOMEONE ELSE BY CLAIMING TO BE
ON THE OLYMPIC ROWING TEAM.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.121
IT WORKED.

18:43.353 --> 18:45.824
RYDER, NOT MANY BOYS
WOULD HAVE THE COURAGE

18:45.825 --> 18:47.726
TO CONFESS A LIE TO THEIR
GIRLFRIEND'S PARENTS.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.429
BUT YOU DID IT FOR
A SWEET REASON.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.701
SO, WE FEEL COMFORTABLE

18:52.702 --> 18:54.533
ENDORSING YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH KEIRA.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.865
PROVIDED YOU FOLLOW ALL
GUIDELINES AND RESTRICTIONS

18:56.866 --> 18:58.337
IMPOSED BY OUR FAMILY.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.538
THIS SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S
A LOT TO LEARN.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.740
WE'LL SEND YOU THE P.D.F.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.714
THANK YOU. UM, DID YOU NEED
ANY PAPERWORK FROM ME?

19:05.715 --> 19:07.616
JUST STOP OVER TONIGHT.

19:07.617 --> 19:09.348
WE'RE HAVING A
GLUTEN-FREE BARBECUE.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.820
OKAY. SAVE ME A LEG... OF TOFU.

19:11.821 --> 19:15.484
OH, MY GOSH. THAT
WAS SO AMAZING.

19:15.485 --> 19:17.356
WHAT?

19:17.357 --> 19:19.658
HOW YOU LIED TO MY PARENTS.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.930
"THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME
I EVER TRIED POT."

19:21.931 --> 19:25.294
I WISH I COULD LIE UNDER
PRESSURE LIKE THAT.

19:25.295 --> 19:28.767
MUST BE ALL THOSE POLICE
INTERROGATIONS YOU'VE LIVED THROUGH.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.469
UH, BUT, KEIRA, I'M NOT LYING...

19:30.470 --> 19:33.473
SHUT UP AND KISS ME,
YOU BAD BAD BOY.

19:35.545 --> 19:37.446
- HEY, THERE.
- JOE, LOOK.

19:37.447 --> 19:39.278
I'M GETTING REAL-TIME
UPDATES FROM LENNOX.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.179
SHE AND ZANDER ARE
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.651
WOW! THIS REACTION

19:42.652 --> 19:45.815
FROM THE WOMAN WHO WANTED ME TO
NANNY-IZE ZANDER INTO A FINE POWDER.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.587
IF LENNOX IS HAPPY, I'M HAPPY.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.819
YOU ARE A TOTAL FLIP-FLOPPER,
YOU KNOW THAT?

19:50.820 --> 19:52.661
WELL, WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE,

19:52.662 --> 19:54.523
WHO AMONG US IS NOT
A FLIP-FLOPPER?

19:54.524 --> 19:56.395
AND YOU KNOW WHY
THIS IS HAPPENING?

19:56.396 --> 19:58.397
BECAUSE A CERTAIN NIECE
HAD A CONVERSATION

19:58.398 --> 19:59.869
WITH A CERTAIN COOL AUNT.

20:02.272 --> 20:03.302
THIS IS HAPPENING
ALL BECAUSE OF YOU?

20:03.303 --> 20:04.433
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT?

20:04.434 --> 20:05.734
POSITIVE. I MEAN, WHO
ELSE WAS INVOLVED?

20:05.735 --> 20:06.806
NOBODY.

20:07.837 --> 20:10.379
LENNOX NEEDS ME AND I, WELL,

20:10.380 --> 20:11.441
I NEED TO BE NEEDED.

20:12.542 --> 20:13.543
YOU KNOW WHAT, MEL?

20:15.945 --> 20:17.446
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT WAS, UH...

20:17.447 --> 20:18.448
IT WAS ALL YOU.

20:19.449 --> 20:20.519
HEY!

20:20.520 --> 20:22.691
BY THE WAY, LOOK WHAT I
GOT AT THE MARKET TODAY.

20:22.692 --> 20:24.653
- BUTTERNUT SQUASH.
- MM. WHY?

20:24.654 --> 20:25.754
TO MAKE YOUR FAVORITE SOUP.

20:25.755 --> 20:27.497
( gasps ) CHICKEN MATZO BALL?

20:29.429 --> 20:30.760
FLIP-FLOPPER!

20:36.736 --> 20:38.737
( rooster crows )

20:38.738 --> 20:40.739
WELL... ( sighs ) THAT'S
THE END OF OUR DATE.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.741
- I'LL WALK YOU HOME.
- MM.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.943
HOW ABOUT I STAY
FIVE MORE MINUTES?

20:44.944 --> 20:46.475
NO. NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

20:46.476 --> 20:48.547
I SIGNED A BINDING
AGREEMENT WITH YOUR MOMS.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.018
AND THAT NOTARY
COST ME 10 BUCKS.

20:50.019 --> 20:51.721
WE ARE LEAVING NOW.

20:53.323 --> 20:54.483
( door opens )

20:54.484 --> 20:55.654
MAN!

20:55.655 --> 20:57.756
YOU KNOW, THAT KEIRA
IS SO SHELTERED.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.588
- ( door closes )
- I MEAN, HOMESCHOOLED,

20:59.589 --> 21:01.390
NO TV, NO LATE DATES...

21:01.391 --> 21:02.661
HOW IS SHE GONNA SURVIVE
IN THE REAL WORLD?

21:02.662 --> 21:04.693
I MEAN, HOW IS THAT GIRL
EXPECTED TO LEARN ANYTHING?

21:04.694 --> 21:06.865
HEY, SHE'S STILL
ALLOWED TO READ.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.638
"THE SABRE AND THE LOTUS."

21:09.639 --> 21:12.000
NO NO NO NO NO!

21:12.001 --> 21:13.872
OKAY.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.304
I'LL WAIT TWO YEARS.

21:15.305 --> 21:16.775
WE'LL JUST KEEP IT RIGHT HERE.

21:16.776 --> 21:17.776
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.308
NO WAY. UH-UH. NO.

21:19.309 --> 21:21.780
YOUR SABRE DOES NOT
GO IN MY CUBBY.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.753
OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE
NOT READ PAGE 37.
