'Scuse me,

00:56.412 --> 00:58.719
have you seen a blowfish
driving a sports car?

01:00.628 --> 01:01.410
Thank you!

01:08.360 --> 01:09.646
Bloody Torchwood!

01:09.832 --> 01:11.184
<i>Species not on record,</i>

01:11.211 --> 01:14.092
DNA-type says some sort of land fish.

01:14.105 --> 01:16.730
All I'm saying is, you are speeding
and there are children.

01:16.731 --> 01:18.626
Kids out at midnight,
they've got it coming.

01:18.627 --> 01:20.708
Detecting high levels of algae.

01:20.709 --> 01:22.431
Who's afraid of the big scary fish?

01:22.432 --> 01:24.061
Big fish with a gun.

01:24.062 --> 01:25.813
- Special weapons?
- Not that I can see.

01:25.814 --> 01:27.112
Do we need special weapons?

01:27.113 --> 01:28.571
What are we gonna
do when we catch it?

01:28.572 --> 01:31.335
- Jack would know.
- Well, ]ack's not here, is he?

01:31.336 --> 01:34.385
]ack's disappeared!
Fat lot of good jack is!

01:37.834 --> 01:38.673
Blowfish!!

01:39.992 --> 01:40.764
Hold on!

02:07.274 --> 02:09.021
- Hold the wheel.
- Don't you dare, Owen!

02:09.023 --> 02:10.127
Hold the wheel!

02:10.532 --> 02:11.568
Right, got it.

02:31.422 --> 02:32.821
Where is it, where's it gone?

02:34.933 --> 02:36.023
Go! Go! Go!

02:42.913 --> 02:45.711
Gwen, go left, Tosh go right,
Ianto take centre.

02:46.130 --> 02:46.885
Positions!

02:49.739 --> 02:51.543
Massive levels of adrenalin.

02:51.673 --> 02:54.471
Mixed with approximately
three grams of cocaine.

02:54.569 --> 02:55.645
This fish is wired.

02:55.646 --> 02:58.107
So, this is Team Torchwood.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.589
The teacher's pets.

02:59.673 --> 03:01.324
But teacher's gone, hasn't he?

03:01.533 --> 03:03.351
Leaving the kiddy-kids all alone.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.400
And look at you,

03:04.512 --> 03:06.792
trying so hard to be all grown up.

03:07.169 --> 03:09.813
The Doctor,
with his hands full of blood.

03:10.161 --> 03:13.182
The CMM,
with her oh-so-beating heart.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.895
The Technician,
with her cold devices.

03:16.035 --> 03:20.258
Which leaves me, with the Office Boy,
promoted beyond his measure.

03:20.397 --> 03:23.082
All of you,
lost without your master.

03:23.180 --> 03:25.963
All of you,
pretending to be so brave.

03:26.257 --> 03:28.005
All of you, so scared.

03:28.159 --> 03:28.803
Ha ha ha!

03:30.486 --> 03:32.541
So, what about it, minion?

03:32.583 --> 03:34.709
Can you do it?
How good are you?

03:34.807 --> 03:36.611
How sharp is your aim?

03:37.087 --> 03:38.709
What if you kill her?

03:40.234 --> 03:42.060
What if I kill her first?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.279
Can you shoot, before I do?

03:44.810 --> 03:45.635
Can you?

03:47.230 --> 03:48.055
Dare you?

03:48.796 --> 03:49.775
Would you?

03:50.786 --> 03:51.569
Won't you?

03:59.821 --> 04:00.954
Hey kids.

04:01.704 --> 04:02.915
Did you miss me?

<i>Are you sure no more
like him came through?</i>

04:17.071 --> 04:19.378
Cross-referencing with the
rift activity monitor,

04:19.379 --> 04:20.596
doesn't look like it.

04:21.273 --> 04:23.511
The car's impounded,  I'll get it
back to the owner in the morning.

04:23.546 --> 04:25.427
- How you doing?
- Bio-profile's on screen.

04:25.428 --> 04:28.210
Nothing in his genetic make-up
to contaminate the city.

04:28.211 --> 04:30.745
Ok, Tosh, can you add that
to the species database?

04:30.857 --> 04:31.585
- Ianto?
- Hello!

04:31.586 --> 04:33.515
Sorry, can you deal with
the body when it's cold?

04:33.516 --> 04:35.193
My pleasure and I'll make sushi.

04:35.230 --> 04:36.796
No, the morgue and
I'll do fine, thank you.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.069
Got pretty organised without me.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.272
Yeah, well we had to.

04:39.314 --> 04:40.614
I Did you decorate in here?

04:40.852 --> 04:42.167
You left us, Jack!

04:46.849 --> 04:49.171
- I know. I'm sorry.
- We knew nothing, Jack.

04:51.688 --> 04:52.611
Where were you?

04:58.198 --> 04:59.316
I found my Doctor.

04:59.736 --> 05:01.610
- Did he fix you?
- What's to fix?

05:02.100 --> 05:04.337
You don't mess with
this level of perfection!

05:04.463 --> 05:05.778
Are you going back to him?

05:07.065 --> 05:08.058
I came back for you.

05:11.138 --> 05:11.880
All of you.

05:15.502 --> 05:16.677
Rift activity!

05:40.031 --> 05:41.905
<i>Get off, I didn't do it.</i>

05:44.296 --> 05:46.352
<i>Please, leave me alone.</i>

05:48.659 --> 05:49.247
<i>Duh...</i>

05:50.645 --> 05:51.610
Help me!

05:51.680 --> 05:53.345
Come any closer and
I'll open up his neck!

05:53.400 --> 05:54.813
- Fine!
- What?!

05:54.884 --> 05:56.338
Which artery do you normally sever?

05:56.339 --> 05:57.948
- No.
- I'm not bluffing!

05:57.949 --> 06:00.410
Well, see now you've
given yourself away.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.039
Only someone who's bluffing
ever says they're not.

06:11.843 --> 06:12.850
Oh, God!

06:13.242 --> 06:16.130
Shit! Please, please stop!

06:16.825 --> 06:17.525
Well...

06:18.336 --> 06:18.937
No.

06:24.654 --> 06:25.423
He's dead.

06:29.200 --> 06:29.927
Please...

06:31.479 --> 06:32.137
I...

06:33.102 --> 06:34.204
was never here.

06:38.302 --> 06:38.932
Go.

06:44.386 --> 06:45.589
Thirsty now.

07:02.415 --> 07:03.156
All right!

07:04.219 --> 07:04.722
Now...

07:06.069 --> 07:07.565
You... go.

07:07.971 --> 07:08.838
You go.

07:09.453 --> 07:10.097
You go.

07:10.167 --> 07:12.041
You stay.

07:12.390 --> 07:12.852
Go.

07:13.062 --> 07:13.677
Go.

07:14.153 --> 07:14.768
Go.

07:15.126 --> 07:15.573
Stay.

07:15.783 --> 07:16.314
Go.

07:16.356 --> 07:16.804
Go.

07:16.860 --> 07:17.237
Go.

07:17.307 --> 07:17.699
Go.

07:17.853 --> 07:18.272
Go.

07:18.356 --> 07:18.916
Oh...

07:19.447 --> 07:20.552
Stay, stay, stay.

07:20.916 --> 07:21.293
Go.

07:21.349 --> 07:21.699
Go.

07:21.783 --> 07:22.077
Go.

07:22.160 --> 07:22.566
Go.

07:22.678 --> 07:22.944
Go.

07:22.969 --> 07:24.712
The rest of you, go.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.180
I'll take one of everything.

07:27.333 --> 07:28.285
Any questions?

07:28.368 --> 07:31.655
All right, mate,
let's take it outside.

07:31.879 --> 07:32.550
Oh.

07:33.138 --> 07:34.438
Did I mention I'm armed?

07:41.659 --> 07:43.673
Ha ha ha ha ha!

07:55.280 --> 07:58.245
Fragments of rift energy, around
the neck, arm and shoulders.

07:58.365 --> 08:00.057
He was grabbed... and pushed.

08:00.751 --> 08:02.877
Explains the residual energy cluster

08:02.905 --> 08:04.444
How did you ever manage without me?

08:04.445 --> 08:06.362
So, there's a killer on the loose.

08:06.363 --> 08:07.601
Bipedal, maybe humanoid.

08:07.741 --> 08:09.506
Any other alien tech involved, Tosh?

08:09.590 --> 08:10.737
No readings to suggest that.

08:10.738 --> 08:12.821
Ok, let's get back and see what
we can piece together.

08:12.835 --> 08:13.954
Technology gain you?

08:14.010 --> 08:15.688
I was hoping for a power struggle,

08:15.744 --> 08:17.719
resolved by some naked wrestling.

08:17.873 --> 08:18.838
Thank you, Andy.

08:19.061 --> 08:22.698
You can let SOCO in now, they can
eliminate us from whatever they want.

08:23.047 --> 08:25.168
This another one of your spooky-dos?

08:25.238 --> 08:27.840
Not yet, but I'll let you know.

08:28.399 --> 08:30.749
"Thanks, Andy.
You've been very helpful."

08:31.042 --> 08:32.198
Don't mention it, Gwen.

08:35.283 --> 08:36.947
Whoa, that never beeps.

08:37.297 --> 08:38.485
That's what I was thinking.

08:40.429 --> 08:42.332
<i>I can't believe I got
the answer machine!</i>

08:42.346 --> 08:44.542
<i>What can you be doing that's
more important than me?</i>

08:45.235 --> 08:49.875
<i>Anyway, you've probably traced
the energy shift, found the body.</i>

08:50.228 --> 08:51.738
<i>All me, sorry about the mess.</i>

08:51.948 --> 08:53.207
<i>Bill me for the clean-up.</i>

08:53.337 --> 08:55.183
<i>Now, drinks!</i>

08:55.499 --> 08:57.782
<i>Retrolock the transmission coordinates,
that's where I am.</i>

08:57.783 --> 09:00.016
<i>And hurry up, work to do!</i>

09:00.422 --> 09:03.149
<i>Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi,
you're my only hope!</i>

09:05.857 --> 09:07.941
Stay here. Don't come after me.

09:07.997 --> 09:09.703
- Who was that?
- Stay here.

09:10.934 --> 09:13.060
Hey, Jack! Wait!

09:14.330 --> 09:16.876
See that! He swans back in
and then he shuts us right out.

09:16.877 --> 09:18.638
- I'm not having this.
- I can track him.

09:19.561 --> 09:20.582
Taxi!

11:09.527 --> 11:10.625
Tell the police we're dealing with it.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.691
Ok, so, who the hell was
the bloke in the hologram?

11:12.692 --> 11:13.656
Jack recognised him.

11:13.657 --> 11:14.817
Why didn't he let us go with him?

11:14.818 --> 11:18.551
It's typical Jack, he disappears,
he comes back, then he runs away again.

11:18.860 --> 11:20.567
We don't even know his real name.

11:20.568 --> 11:21.854
Or which time he comes from.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.895
He's supposed to be our boss,
we know nothing about him.

11:24.259 --> 11:25.518
It drives me crazy!

11:29.144 --> 11:30.361
It is more fun when
he's around, though.

11:30.362 --> 11:31.675
- Yeah.
- Definitely!

11:31.676 --> 11:32.333
Yeah, it is!

11:40.064 --> 11:42.232
- You're putting on weight?
- You're losing your hair?

11:42.505 --> 11:43.134
What are you wearing?

11:43.135 --> 11:44.924
Captain Jack Harkness,
note the stripes.

11:44.925 --> 11:46.826
Captain John Hart,
note the sarcasm.

11:46.827 --> 11:48.446
I worked my way up
through the ranks.

11:48.447 --> 11:50.208
I bet the ranks were very grateful.

11:51.153 --> 11:51.859
I need a drink.

11:51.936 --> 11:53.293
I thought you'd never ask.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.666
So, how was rehab?

12:08.527 --> 12:10.205
Rehabs. Plural.

12:11.166 --> 12:14.019
- Drink, drugs, sex and...
- Murder.

12:14.466 --> 12:17.250
Ha ha!
You went to murder rehab?

12:17.251 --> 12:18.550
I know, ridiculous.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.858
The odd kill, who does it hurt?

12:21.603 --> 12:22.512
You clean now?

12:22.596 --> 12:24.456
Kicked everything.
Living like a priest.

12:28.233 --> 12:30.121
So, how's the Time Agency?

12:30.946 --> 12:31.841
You didn't hear?

12:33.147 --> 12:33.986
Shut down.

12:37.105 --> 12:38.084
You're kidding.

12:38.475 --> 12:41.468
No. There's only seven of us left now.

12:42.741 --> 12:43.454
Wow.

12:44.380 --> 12:45.499
It's good to see you.

12:47.947 --> 12:49.667
It was never the same without you.

12:52.282 --> 12:53.065
You need to go.

12:53.213 --> 12:54.807
I don't want you on my territory.

12:54.989 --> 12:55.647
What?

12:58.760 --> 13:01.208
Time was, you couldn't get enough
of me on your "territory".

13:04.984 --> 13:07.222
All right, everybody out!

13:10.191 --> 13:11.114
Everything all right, Jack?

13:11.115 --> 13:12.582
It's ok, ok, ok.

13:13.128 --> 13:15.533
You've got a team!
How sweet!

13:15.701 --> 13:17.813
Oh, pretty little friends!

13:17.992 --> 13:20.048
No blonde, though.
You need a blonde.

13:20.309 --> 13:23.069
- God, he's worse than Jack.
- Oh, do you have a team name?

13:23.070 --> 13:24.796
I love team names, go on!

13:24.966 --> 13:25.903
Torchwood.

13:25.904 --> 13:28.220
Oh. Not Excalibur?

13:29.017 --> 13:31.101
Blizzard? Bikini Cops? No?

13:31.632 --> 13:33.325
Torchwood. Oh, dear.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.434
Gwen Cooper, Ianto Jones,
Toshiko Sato, Owen Harper,

13:37.588 --> 13:39.141
- meet...
- Captain John Hart.

13:39.392 --> 13:43.015
- We go back.
- Excuse me. We more than go back.

13:43.061 --> 13:43.956
We were partners.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.900
- In what way?
- In every way.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.013
And then some.

13:47.014 --> 13:47.895
It was two weeks.

13:47.896 --> 13:50.650
Except that two weeks was
trapped in a time loop,

13:50.651 --> 13:52.496
so we were together for five years,

13:52.497 --> 13:53.727
it was like having a wife.

13:53.728 --> 13:55.776
- You were the wife.
- YOU were the wife.

13:55.777 --> 13:58.504
- No, YOU were the wife.
- Oh, but I was a good wife.

13:58.728 --> 13:59.693
I bet you were.

14:00.434 --> 14:01.175
What?

14:01.602 --> 14:03.588
Don't pretend you
haven't noticed, he's cute.

14:03.714 --> 14:04.763
They're just shy.

14:04.847 --> 14:05.980
What are you doing here?

14:07.798 --> 14:09.239
I was wondering when I we'd get to that.

14:10.874 --> 14:13.098
- That's the same as yours.
- A little smaller.

14:13.699 --> 14:15.560
But lasts much longer.

14:16.217 --> 14:18.217
Get two Time Agents
in the same room together,

14:18.218 --> 14:19.994
it's always about the
size of the wrist strap.

14:20.106 --> 14:22.190
Yes, sorry, what's a Time Agent?

14:22.274 --> 14:23.812
What, he's never told
you about his past?

14:23.813 --> 14:24.973
No, he hasn't.

14:26.078 --> 14:26.931
Anyway...

14:30.772 --> 14:32.003
I'm working with this woman,

14:33.080 --> 14:33.709
beautiful,

14:34.171 --> 14:37.765
clever, sexy, yadda yadda yadda,
and we both get shot.

14:38.031 --> 14:39.779
And as she's dying, she begs me.

14:39.780 --> 14:42.744
She tells me about these radiation
cluster bombs she'd been working on.

14:42.745 --> 14:44.184
I don't like the sound of that.

14:44.380 --> 14:45.569
Three canisters,

14:45.807 --> 14:48.604
contents beyond toxic,
swallowed up in a riftstorm.

14:48.715 --> 14:50.604
- And ended up here.
- Bingo.

14:50.882 --> 14:53.959
That's the downside of your city being
built on a rift in space and time.

14:54.323 --> 14:56.029
Now, left to their own devices,

14:56.127 --> 14:57.863
the radiation will break
down the canisters

14:57.877 --> 15:00.241
and then infect your people and planet.

15:00.814 --> 15:02.185
They need to be neutralised.

15:04.704 --> 15:05.795
What do you get out of this?

15:06.495 --> 15:07.949
Dying woman's wish.

15:10.131 --> 15:11.376
Now, there's only one problem.

15:11.446 --> 15:12.732
I don't know where they are.

15:12.962 --> 15:14.920
I Hoping local knowledge might help.

15:15.074 --> 15:16.011
When we get back to the Hub,

15:16.012 --> 15:18.412
I can run a citywide scan
on radiation surges

15:18.413 --> 15:21.726
and cross reference that with the
rift activity during that time span.

15:21.852 --> 15:23.810
What are you,
the brains and the beauty?

15:24.342 --> 15:26.090
You see, together it's an easy job.

15:26.562 --> 15:27.443
We do this,

15:28.464 --> 15:30.241
you get of here when its finished.
Right away.

15:30.255 --> 15:32.282
Does this mean I get to see your house?

15:38.970 --> 15:40.802
You live in a sculpture?

15:41.235 --> 15:42.928
Could you be any more pretentious?

15:43.012 --> 15:43.641
Get on.

15:46.714 --> 15:48.910
So, your team not allowed in this way?

15:50.098 --> 15:51.986
This is the entrance for tourists.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.847
I remember the last time you said that.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.140
Where the hell...

16:02.753 --> 16:03.704
It's roomy,

16:04.053 --> 16:05.214
I'll give you that.

16:08.378 --> 16:11.273
Your taste in interior design
hasn't got any better, though.

16:13.413 --> 16:15.441
What is this, sewer chic?

16:23.369 --> 16:24.180
Weapons.

16:37.116 --> 16:38.137
And the rest.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.612
Oh, you know me,
I'm a two-weapon man.

16:41.389 --> 16:43.068
One pistol strapped to each leg,

16:43.069 --> 16:44.830
laser knife beneath left elbow,

16:44.831 --> 16:47.389
17 small explosive charges
in the lining of his coat.

16:47.543 --> 16:48.886
I Slipped my mind.

16:51.645 --> 16:54.065
He's a compulsive liar!
Why is he in the building?

16:54.066 --> 16:55.743
There's a tiny 1% chance,

16:55.785 --> 16:57.813
he's breaking a habit of a lifetime,
and telling the truth.

16:57.814 --> 16:59.603
Which means this city is in danger.

16:59.604 --> 17:01.603
What did he mean by a Time Agent?

17:01.873 --> 17:02.869
You've never mentioned it.

17:03.037 --> 17:03.984
That was in the past.

17:04.054 --> 17:06.180
Oh, here we go again.

17:06.599 --> 17:09.606
You know everything about me, Jack.
Why d'you keep shutting me out?

17:09.898 --> 17:12.108
Here and now,
that's what's important.

17:12.179 --> 17:14.934
The work we do, the person I am now.

17:14.998 --> 17:17.614
- That's what I'm proud of.
- Then why did you desert us?

17:23.631 --> 17:24.714
Where did you go?

17:25.742 --> 17:27.603
No, no, come on, where did you go?
Tell me.

17:29.351 --> 17:30.064
Talk to me.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.679
I have died so many times.

17:38.770 --> 17:40.486
Been dragged back into life,

17:41.605 --> 17:43.731
like being hauled over broken glass.

17:46.290 --> 17:47.912
I saw the end of the world.

17:48.595 --> 17:50.525
- How?
- Doesn't matter now.

17:51.643 --> 17:53.112
But after it was all over...

17:55.028 --> 17:56.902
...I knew I belong here.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.779
What kept me fighting was the
thought of coming home to you.

18:10.499 --> 18:11.995
- What's this?
- TMS.

18:12.065 --> 18:14.009
That's an engagement ring, that is.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.261
- You're getting married?
- Yes.

18:19.519 --> 18:20.484
Rhys asked.

18:21.198 --> 18:22.428
When you were away.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.463
Wow! Gwen Cooper getting married.

18:29.117 --> 18:29.984
Down on one knee?

18:29.985 --> 18:33.159
He tried to, he had a twinge in his
back and had to lie on the settee,

18:33.160 --> 18:34.333
and he popped the question.

18:34.334 --> 18:36.697
- And you said yes.
- Well, no-one else will have me.

18:43.780 --> 18:44.633
Good for you.

18:53.364 --> 18:55.280
- We should get back to work.
- Mm-hm.

18:59.028 --> 19:02.049
Seven hours ago we logged
a minor surge in rift energy,

19:02.063 --> 19:03.406
across three locations.

19:03.811 --> 19:06.623
Six of us, three locations, simple.
Two people per canister.

19:06.624 --> 19:08.154
Excuse me, I give the orders.

19:08.155 --> 19:09.832
Well, give some, big boy!

19:10.247 --> 19:13.087
John's right. Sorry, erm,
d'you prefer John, or Captain?

19:13.088 --> 19:16.052
With eyes like yours,
call me Vera, I won't complain.

19:16.387 --> 19:19.436
Tosh and Owen, take the north.
Ianto and jack go west.

19:19.528 --> 19:20.815
Me and Vera'll take the docks.

19:20.816 --> 19:22.913
Excuse me, not to repeat myself.

19:22.914 --> 19:24.325
Got a problem with this, Jack?

19:28.645 --> 19:29.470
Not at all.

19:30.141 --> 19:33.176
Now, given the canisters are
radioactive, don't open them, eh?

19:33.834 --> 19:34.659
Let's go, guys.

19:34.660 --> 19:35.876
Gwen, I need a word.

19:36.696 --> 19:37.885
Oh, can I watch?

19:37.886 --> 19:40.248
He's gonna give you all the
dos and don'ts. I love it.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.003
She'll be with you in a second.

19:48.906 --> 19:49.899
What the hell are you doing?

19:49.900 --> 19:52.263
If I can get him talking, flirt a bit,

19:52.472 --> 19:53.745
he might drop his guard.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.829
I can find out what he's really upto.

19:55.997 --> 19:57.451
- OK, clever.
- Thank you.

19:57.452 --> 19:59.405
But dangerous, leave it to me.

19:59.406 --> 20:02.105
I led the team while you were
away, Jack. I can handle this.

20:03.372 --> 20:06.072
He knows you too well,
he'll never tell you the truth.

20:08.141 --> 20:09.107
Three rules.

20:09.170 --> 20:11.296
One: don't believe anything he says.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.821
Two: always keep him in front of you.

20:12.835 --> 20:14.037
And three:

20:14.527 --> 20:16.625
under no circumstances let him kiss you.

20:16.751 --> 20:17.911
As if I would!

20:18.445 --> 20:20.710
Has he gone to  the no-kissing rule yet?

20:20.976 --> 20:23.564
<i>He only invented that because
he wants me all to himself.</i>

20:26.683 --> 20:27.648
Keep infront.

20:34.823 --> 20:35.564
Nothing.

20:38.676 --> 20:40.159
Are you sure this is the right spot?

20:40.160 --> 20:42.718
Yeah. But containers
get shifted all the time.

20:43.141 --> 20:44.718
This could take days.

20:45.770 --> 20:47.225
So, that woman,

20:47.379 --> 20:48.749
the one with the canister,

20:49.001 --> 20:50.442
how did you get to know her again?

20:51.477 --> 20:52.470
We were in love.

20:53.504 --> 20:54.049
Oh.

20:56.259 --> 20:56.972
I'm sorry.

20:59.224 --> 21:01.098
Did they catch the person who shot her?

21:03.246 --> 21:04.491
Do we have to talk about this?

21:04.492 --> 21:06.085
No, no, of course not.

21:14.251 --> 21:15.272
Don't mind me.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.082
- Shouldn't you be asleep?
- I got it!

21:22.683 --> 21:23.243
<i>Sorry?</i>

21:23.914 --> 21:25.327
Manager at Hanovoods!

21:25.620 --> 21:26.725
<i>The letter was on the mat!</i>

21:26.907 --> 21:28.292
I got the bloody job!

21:28.879 --> 21:30.641
Oh, my God! Rhys, that is fantastic!

21:30.642 --> 21:32.196
Baby, you're fantastic too.

21:32.197 --> 21:33.609
Yeah, just there!

21:33.847 --> 21:35.812
- Who's that?
- It's some...

21:36.064 --> 21:37.784
idiot I work with that's all.

21:38.350 --> 21:41.469
<i>I don't suppose there's any chance
of me seeing you before breakfast?</i>

21:41.883 --> 21:45.855
It looks like it's gonna be an
all-nighter. So, get yourself to bed.

21:46.317 --> 21:47.785
I am so proud of you.

21:47.975 --> 21:48.604
<i>I love you.</i>

21:48.674 --> 21:50.422
Yeah, well, I love you more.

21:57.166 --> 21:57.642
John?

22:03.922 --> 22:04.397
John?

22:08.367 --> 22:09.220
John!

22:15.584 --> 22:17.136
- John!!
- Worried you'd lost me?

22:17.271 --> 22:18.935
Whoa. Little bit jumpy there?

22:19.033 --> 22:20.418
Keep in front of me, OK?

22:21.970 --> 22:23.802
God, you're so untrusting.

22:25.065 --> 22:27.261
But with your boss it's probably wise.

22:27.262 --> 22:29.289
Yeah, I trust him just fine,
thank you.

22:29.353 --> 22:31.423
Once a conman, always a conman.

22:31.493 --> 22:32.458
What do you mean by that?

22:35.193 --> 22:37.696
Look, just don't rely on him, Gwen.

22:38.298 --> 22:40.186
There's a lot about him you don't know.

22:42.754 --> 22:43.999
Fancy a peek?

22:48.985 --> 22:49.873
Aha!

22:51.334 --> 22:52.299
Is that it?

22:58.887 --> 22:59.992
What are you doing?!

23:01.727 --> 23:02.524
Get off me!

23:03.321 --> 23:04.468
Celebrating,

23:04.664 --> 23:05.475
that's all.

23:05.561 --> 23:08.498
God, the 21st century is so frigid!

23:08.554 --> 23:09.477
What've you done?

23:11.183 --> 23:12.106
Don't get up.

23:12.442 --> 23:14.246
I mean, you can't anyway.

23:17.482 --> 23:18.993
Paralysing lip gloss.

23:20.112 --> 23:22.769
I think it might have even been
Jack taught me that trick.

23:23.105 --> 23:24.056
Just one problem,

23:24.336 --> 23:26.923
if you're not found in two hours,

23:26.924 --> 23:29.419
your major organs will go into shutdown.

23:29.923 --> 23:30.748
Thanks.

23:33.908 --> 23:35.754
<i>You gonna be OK in here without me?</i>

23:39.656 --> 23:41.180
He won't stay with you.

23:42.739 --> 23:44.473
He and I shared something.

24:21.301 --> 24:22.392
No bulbs.

24:22.868 --> 24:25.623
No, cos that would only be helpful.

24:27.760 --> 24:31.284
Oh, great, how are we gonna find
a canister in all this tut?

24:32.683 --> 24:34.893
What are we doing with our lives, Tosh?

24:35.298 --> 24:36.347
I know,

24:36.567 --> 24:38.539
we should be out having fun!

24:39.658 --> 24:42.259
Bet you'd normally be out
on the pull, this time of night.

24:42.791 --> 24:44.972
Oh, no, bollocks to that, Tosh.

24:45.727 --> 24:47.909
Talk about diminishing returns.

24:48.650 --> 24:49.755
Not with you.

24:50.958 --> 24:52.454
Well, you know,

24:52.876 --> 24:54.121
I've done all that, aren't I?

24:54.932 --> 24:56.232
Where did it get me?

24:56.554 --> 24:58.149
No, you know, I need...

24:58.330 --> 24:59.883
a proper woman, you know.

25:00.484 --> 25:03.253
Someone I've got something
in common with, you know.

25:06.043 --> 25:08.071
Got anyone on the horizon?

25:09.941 --> 25:11.158
Like you say,

25:11.766 --> 25:14.647
difficult to meet anyone
I've got anything in common with.

25:16.004 --> 25:17.626
What with the things we see.

25:18.382 --> 25:19.361
You beauty!

25:20.983 --> 25:21.794
Yes!

25:23.829 --> 25:24.640
Job done!

25:25.144 --> 25:26.654
Good work, team!

25:26.822 --> 25:27.969
Where's Gwen?

25:31.941 --> 25:33.007
Ah ah ah!

25:33.440 --> 25:34.573
Gun on the floor.

25:35.217 --> 25:36.335
Or I shoot her.

25:38.573 --> 25:40.447
- Jack, where are you?
- I muted the comms system,

25:40.448 --> 25:42.685
as soon as we left
the palace under the pavement.

25:44.612 --> 25:45.997
I love my little wrist strap.

25:46.892 --> 25:47.507
Now...

25:48.948 --> 25:49.703
Phones.

25:52.938 --> 25:57.064
You touch her again,
and I will kill you. OK?

26:05.631 --> 26:09.435
The efficiency of a gun,
or the brutality of wood?

26:10.064 --> 26:12.218
Yeah, look, stop toying with me
and get on with it.

26:16.272 --> 26:17.391
Oh, yeah!

26:18.132 --> 26:19.573
Loving that officy feel!

26:20.118 --> 26:21.978
I always get excited in these places.

26:23.210 --> 26:24.623
To me, they're exotic.

26:24.861 --> 26:26.441
Office romances...

26:27.644 --> 26:29.182
photocopying your butt...

26:29.252 --> 26:31.378
or maybe not your butt,
although as we're here...

26:31.477 --> 26:34.184
The rift was active at these coordinates

26:34.185 --> 26:35.995
200 feet above ground.

26:35.996 --> 26:37.338
That means this floor...

26:38.240 --> 26:39.150
or the roof.

26:43.261 --> 26:44.464
How are you, Ianto?

26:44.755 --> 26:46.615
All the better for having.
You back, sir.

26:48.671 --> 26:50.195
Can we maybe drop the sir, now?

26:50.363 --> 26:52.307
While I was away, I was thinking...

26:53.007 --> 26:53.944
Maybe we could,

26:54.097 --> 26:56.314
when this is all done...

26:56.608 --> 26:59.209
Dinner? A movie?

27:01.792 --> 27:04.463
Are you asking me out on a date?

27:05.162 --> 27:06.155
Interested?

27:07.484 --> 27:08.071
Well...

27:08.795 --> 27:09.299
As...

27:09.802 --> 27:11.816
long as it's not in an office.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.152
Some fetishes should
I be kept to you sir.

27:16.512 --> 27:18.554
Looks like we're gonna have
to go through every drawer,

27:18.555 --> 27:19.897
bin and plant pot.

27:20.512 --> 27:21.380
Right. OK.

27:23.729 --> 27:26.722
I'll do this floor, don't want
you getting overexcited,

27:27.519 --> 27:28.526
and you take the roof.

27:28.988 --> 27:30.205
You're good on roofs.

27:32.344 --> 27:32.946
Jack?

27:35.561 --> 27:36.778
Why are we helping him?

27:37.756 --> 27:39.518
He's a reminder of my past.

27:39.742 --> 27:40.875
I want him gone.

27:44.735 --> 27:45.560
By the way...

27:46.903 --> 27:48.189
- Was that a yes?
- Yes!

28:43.913 --> 28:46.025
Into the lift, eye candy.

28:52.468 --> 28:53.783
Your friends are bleeding,

28:54.636 --> 28:55.559
and dying.

28:56.272 --> 28:58.663
You barely have enough
time to save them.

29:00.124 --> 29:01.704
Owen? Gwen?

29:01.705 --> 29:02.879
What am I, a child?

29:02.880 --> 29:05.173
It's primitive technology,
easily blocked,

29:05.174 --> 29:06.585
you should be embarrassed.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.033
And when you get to the bottom, run.

29:09.387 --> 29:12.115
You look like a man who enjoys a
challenge, see if you can save them.

29:12.380 --> 29:13.387
Come back up here,

29:14.520 --> 29:15.625
I'll shoot on sight.

29:16.884 --> 29:17.568
<i>Going down.</i>

29:17.569 --> 29:18.394
Going down!

29:18.758 --> 29:19.975
Yes, please.

29:21.986 --> 29:23.133
Why are you doing this?

29:23.188 --> 29:25.398
We're a cosmic joke, eye candy.

29:25.972 --> 29:28.517
An accident of chemicals
and evolution.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.923
The jokes, the sex,

29:30.968 --> 29:33.346
just cover the fact that
nothing means anything.

29:33.486 --> 29:36.367
And the only consolation, is money.

29:38.017 --> 29:40.577
So run, Ianto Jones!

29:40.731 --> 29:41.766
<i>Going down.</i>

29:43.363 --> 29:44.510
<i>Doors closing.</i>

29:56.798 --> 29:58.281
Rear of the Year,

29:59.344 --> 30:00.505
5094.

30:00.742 --> 30:01.833
Still looking good.

30:03.078 --> 30:04.882
Cute boy, ringing to
warn you about me.

30:05.330 --> 30:06.085
Canister.

30:06.364 --> 30:08.854
- If you've harmed them...
- They're pretty, but stupid.

30:08.896 --> 30:09.931
You used to have better taste.

30:10.684 --> 30:12.082
Doesn't look like that from here.

30:12.516 --> 30:13.677
Just give it here.

30:14.040 --> 30:16.712
Radiation cluster bombs? Really?

30:17.117 --> 30:18.628
Let's not get hung up on details.

30:18.629 --> 30:21.775
Little embarrassing that
you needed help to find them.

30:21.842 --> 30:24.682
A little humiliated
you fell for the scam.

30:24.710 --> 30:26.612
Your dolly birds did all my leg I work.

30:26.761 --> 30:27.782
Is that what you wanted?

30:28.034 --> 30:31.838
What I want is for you
to come to your senses.

30:32.339 --> 30:33.542
Join me, Jack.

30:33.906 --> 30:36.157
Back in the old routine.
We'd be emperors.

30:36.927 --> 30:40.563
How can you stay tied to one planet
when there's thousands of worlds,

30:40.619 --> 30:42.339
sparkling with wonder?

30:43.924 --> 30:45.087
We should be up there,

30:45.927 --> 30:47.311
among the stars,

30:47.423 --> 30:49.003
claiming them for our own.

30:49.759 --> 30:51.003
Just like before.

30:52.066 --> 30:54.122
- I can't.
- Why not?

30:54.682 --> 30:57.199
What the hell is there
to keep you here?

30:58.364 --> 30:59.818
Come on.

31:00.364 --> 31:02.000
The glitter of the galaxy.

31:02.532 --> 31:04.140
The mischief we could make.

31:08.686 --> 31:11.260
Y'know, you never really
mastered that temptation spiel.

31:11.316 --> 31:13.302
It's not a spiel. It's fact.

31:13.330 --> 31:14.323
Move on.

31:16.449 --> 31:17.540
Here I am,

31:17.656 --> 31:21.195
in a new life and you're still churning
out the same old tunes.

31:21.223 --> 31:24.593
And sorry, but they don't play as well,
now you're looking a little older.

31:24.594 --> 31:26.901
What are they, wrinkles
around your eyes?

31:26.902 --> 31:27.810
Laugh lines.

31:27.839 --> 31:29.392
Oh, hell of a good joke.

31:29.406 --> 31:32.147
It's you I'm laughing at. Canister.

31:33.560 --> 31:34.385
Whoops.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.585
Ha ha ha!

31:39.494 --> 31:40.278
Whoops.

32:18.894 --> 32:20.405
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

32:23.552 --> 32:25.132
Why didn't he just kill us?

32:25.133 --> 32:26.405
He got what he wanted.

32:27.580 --> 32:29.608
But maybe he just underestimated us.

32:39.094 --> 32:40.730
<i>Tosh! Owen!</i>

32:40.731 --> 32:41.647
Ianto!

32:41.689 --> 32:42.654
<i>Tosh!</i>

32:42.723 --> 32:43.982
We're over here.

32:45.403 --> 32:47.277
- What happened?
- Where's Gwen?

32:47.347 --> 32:48.955
- Have you heard from Gwen?
- No.

33:07.808 --> 33:08.549
Rehab...

33:09.920 --> 33:11.137
didn't really work.

33:16.599 --> 33:17.914
Front door key.

33:18.431 --> 33:19.158
Thanks.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.486
If she's in one of these, we'll
never find her, there's too many!

33:42.570 --> 33:43.758
Just keep looking!

33:44.500 --> 33:46.402
God, I need more painkillers!

33:48.263 --> 33:49.438
I'll try her phone again.

34:00.454 --> 34:01.573
Over here!

34:12.757 --> 34:14.478
- She must've dropped it.
- Gwen!

34:14.590 --> 34:15.359
Gwen!

34:15.541 --> 34:17.975
Unless it's another of
Captain John's tricks.

34:19.359 --> 34:21.246
- What're you doing?
- If Gwen used the phone here,

34:21.248 --> 34:23.610
I can use the network to
triangulate the location.

34:23.610 --> 34:25.261
where she answered her last call.

34:25.443 --> 34:26.058
Got it!

34:33.813 --> 34:35.464
This is where she made the call.

34:35.897 --> 34:38.190
Open every container door!

34:42.063 --> 34:43.225
<i>She's in here!</i>

34:44.315 --> 34:46.330
Gwen, it's all right.

34:46.414 --> 34:47.463
We're here with you.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.518
What happened?
What's he done to her?

34:49.518 --> 34:51.001
She's still breathing,

34:51.090 --> 34:52.530
no discernible injuries.

34:52.585 --> 34:55.118
- Tosh, let's get this thing started.
- Ianto, take a swab.

34:55.579 --> 34:58.418
Right, pupils dilating,
she's still conscious.

34:59.521 --> 35:01.059
Stay with us, darling.

35:09.296 --> 35:10.498
He's poisoned her.

35:10.764 --> 35:12.303
Anti-toxin kit now!

35:12.736 --> 35:14.638
Gwen, hold on.

35:36.405 --> 35:38.615
Had to go and steal a car.

35:40.215 --> 35:42.369
Get yourself noticed.

35:49.180 --> 35:50.019
Now...

36:05.668 --> 36:06.815
OK...

36:11.446 --> 36:13.195
Pretty and resilient.

36:14.467 --> 36:15.572
Is that even fair?

36:15.573 --> 36:17.125
Maybe you didn't realise.

36:17.321 --> 36:19.908
You can beat, shoot, threaten,

36:20.006 --> 36:22.411
and even poison us,
and we keep coming back.

36:22.666 --> 36:24.274
Stronger every time.

36:24.414 --> 36:27.645
Well, I think you ought to know,
your boss is splayed out on the...

36:30.764 --> 36:31.561
Pavement.

36:34.599 --> 36:35.928
Now that's impressive.

36:37.550 --> 36:38.655
Seriously, you can earn...

36:38.893 --> 36:41.662
a fortune in the Vegas galaxies
with an act like that.

36:42.627 --> 36:43.606
Go on, how's it work?

36:45.564 --> 36:46.669
I can't die.

36:47.018 --> 36:47.578
Huh...

36:48.291 --> 36:50.906
- No but, really...
- No, but really, you can't kill me.

36:51.538 --> 36:53.915
No matter how many times you try.

36:54.489 --> 36:55.328
I can't die.

36:56.139 --> 36:56.740
Ever.

37:03.474 --> 37:04.873
But what does it cost you?

37:05.167 --> 37:07.796
Every time you have to drag yourself
back here, how does it feel?

37:08.698 --> 37:10.321
All... that pain and trauma.

37:11.677 --> 37:14.740
Plus, you're reborn into
this godforsaken mess.

37:14.849 --> 37:15.828
I pity you.

37:18.695 --> 37:19.716
These people,

37:20.793 --> 37:21.786
this planet,

37:22.178 --> 37:23.940
all the beauty you could never see.

37:25.834 --> 37:27.218
That's what I come back for.

37:27.337 --> 37:28.806
Well, goody on you.

37:29.016 --> 37:30.148
What's in the canisters?

37:30.162 --> 37:31.799
It's come clean time, Captain.

37:33.826 --> 37:34.735
Yeah, all right.

37:34.833 --> 37:36.343
That woman I told you about,

37:36.860 --> 37:38.874
had herself an Arcadian diamond,

37:39.238 --> 37:41.168
the rarest gem in the Damascene Cluster.

37:41.201 --> 37:43.075
Just when I'd got my hands on her,

37:43.076 --> 37:45.550
she only generates her
own personal riftstorm.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.669
God, I hate technological geniuses.

37:50.082 --> 37:52.152
You said this was a
dying woman's request.

37:52.153 --> 37:54.263
Yeah, she was dying. I shot her.

37:54.935 --> 37:57.872
Thought my luck had changed
when I found it had ended up here.

37:59.265 --> 38:00.790
So, I'm thinking 50/50?

38:01.167 --> 38:02.846
Even split, good deal.

38:03.559 --> 38:05.167
Or if anyone fancies an orgy?

38:11.472 --> 38:13.360
- Open it.
- What, not even a please?

38:13.640 --> 38:15.402
Don't your manners get
brought back to life too?

38:15.472 --> 38:16.326
Now!

38:18.362 --> 38:20.992
This should give us
the location of the diamond.

38:24.796 --> 38:25.971
There she is.

38:26.950 --> 38:28.139
The woman you murdered.

38:28.858 --> 38:31.137
<i>You've travelled several
galaxies for this.</i>

38:31.571 --> 38:32.445
<i>Well done.</i>

38:32.446 --> 38:33.591
Thank you, gorgeous.

38:33.619 --> 38:34.487
<i>Except...</i>

38:35.179 --> 38:36.479
<i>There's no diamond.</i>

38:37.053 --> 38:37.570
What?

38:38.381 --> 38:39.962
<i>Only this.</i>

38:43.360 --> 38:44.493
No, no, no.

38:45.125 --> 38:46.957
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, ...

38:46.958 --> 38:48.272
It's got to be a diamond.

38:48.273 --> 38:49.629
It's all about the diamond!

38:50.328 --> 38:51.838
What the hell is that...

38:58.646 --> 39:00.269
<i>It's an explosive device,</i>

39:00.270 --> 39:03.248
<i>which will latch on to the
DNA of whoever killed me.</i>

39:03.249 --> 39:05.159
<i>It'll detonate in ten minutes.</i>

39:05.160 --> 39:08.348
<i>It can't be removed
without exploding, so...</i>

39:09.042 --> 39:10.441
<i>don't bother trying.</i>

39:11.923 --> 39:14.035
<i>Goodbye... lover.</i>

39:14.036 --> 39:16.077
- No Wait.
- See you in hell!

39:16.078 --> 39:17.630
She can't be serious. Ten minutes.

39:17.631 --> 39:18.819
Get it of me!

39:18.820 --> 39:22.735
Actually, nine minutes 50, 49, 48...
Always at the ready!

39:22.736 --> 39:24.749
OK, how big is this
explosion likely to be, Jack?

39:24.750 --> 39:27.258
That technology, that size... big.

39:27.259 --> 39:29.174
So, we should get him out of the city.

39:29.175 --> 39:30.265
Nine minutes 37.

39:30.266 --> 39:32.097
You've got to help me! Please.

39:33.148 --> 39:33.917
Why?

39:36.588 --> 39:37.287
Let her go.

39:38.203 --> 39:39.643
Jack, help me!

39:42.642 --> 39:43.900
Get back!

39:46.203 --> 39:47.140
What've you done?!

39:47.719 --> 39:49.607
It's hypersteel, impermeable,

39:49.608 --> 39:50.530
deadlock sealed.

39:50.531 --> 39:53.663
No way to undo them.
Unless you have this key.

39:54.953 --> 39:56.492
You are UNBELIEVABLE!

39:56.493 --> 39:59.373
And yet, you still find
me strangely attractive.

39:59.537 --> 40:03.481
Now YOU had better find a solution
pronto or she'll be blown up with me!

40:03.482 --> 40:05.104
Would shooting him stop the DNA trigger?

40:05.105 --> 40:05.495
No.

40:05.496 --> 40:07.587
So, what are we gonna do now, team?

40:07.588 --> 40:09.098
The orgy's still on offer by the way.

40:09.099 --> 40:11.321
- Especially now the cuffs are out.
- Nine minutes, four seconds.

40:11.322 --> 40:14.328
Tosh, the rift predictor program,
have you perfected yet?

40:14.329 --> 40:15.463
- Pretty much.
- What?

40:15.464 --> 40:17.800
- Anything in the next few minutes?
- Gwen, no way.

40:17.801 --> 40:18.961
What's she talking about?

40:18.989 --> 40:21.227
If we're in the rift
when that disc explodes,

40:21.517 --> 40:22.482
the city will be safe.

40:22.594 --> 40:24.231
- How does that save us?
- It doesn't.

40:26.167 --> 40:27.509
Eight 32, 31...

40:27.510 --> 40:29.565
- You're bluffing.
- Try me.

40:31.039 --> 40:32.605
The car park where he arrived.

40:32.829 --> 40:34.871
The crack in the rift is
still active up there.

40:35.095 --> 40:35.906
That's where we're going.

40:35.907 --> 40:37.502
Somebody better
start doing something.

40:37.537 --> 40:39.602
- Cut his hand off.
- That would activate the bomb.

40:39.605 --> 40:40.864
Don't make me pull you!

40:40.865 --> 40:42.598
Get up the stairs, now!

40:59.963 --> 41:01.110
Five minutes 22.

41:01.111 --> 41:03.145
I can't find the frequency
the device works on.

41:03.146 --> 41:04.369
There's no chance of jamming it!

41:04.370 --> 41:05.691
Where's Jack? He should be here.

41:05.692 --> 41:07.453
What I've been saying
all along, unreliable.

41:07.454 --> 41:08.133
Shut up!

41:08.315 --> 41:10.686
I think I'm starting to see
what he likes about this place.

41:10.770 --> 41:12.211
She's beautiful, he's stunning.

41:12.212 --> 41:13.176
Don't you ever stop?

41:13.177 --> 41:15.358
What five minutes to live,
you want me to behave.

41:15.819 --> 41:17.400
- Oh, that's gorgeous.
- That's a poodle.

41:17.401 --> 41:18.546
That's nice.

41:22.476 --> 41:25.049
- This better work.
- Trust me, I'm an improviser.

41:32.910 --> 41:33.400
Out!

41:33.931 --> 41:34.952
- Ok.
- Get out!

41:35.207 --> 41:36.493
I do love a woman who's rough.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.598
51 seconds.

41:40.479 --> 41:42.493
You're not really gonna
sacrifice yourself, are you?

41:42.494 --> 41:43.360
45 seconds.

41:43.361 --> 41:44.423
We have to go.

41:44.424 --> 41:46.378
No! What about a last-minute rescue?

41:46.379 --> 41:48.937
Why be on a team if you
don't get a last-minute rescue!

41:48.938 --> 41:50.098
40 seconds.

41:50.316 --> 41:50.946
Tell...

41:51.743 --> 41:52.554
Tell Jack...

41:55.156 --> 41:55.995
Tell Jack I...

42:00.790 --> 42:01.895
<i>30 seconds.</i>

42:02.944 --> 42:04.300
Now what's he doing?

42:09.530 --> 42:10.565
Get off me!

42:12.103 --> 42:13.180
Owen, it's not working.

42:13.181 --> 42:14.187
15 seconds!

42:14.188 --> 42:15.600
- What are you doing?!
- Trying to confuse the disc!

42:15.601 --> 42:17.096
- Why hasn't it worked?
- I don't know!

42:17.097 --> 42:19.082
- 12 seconds!
- Jack, do something!

42:21.799 --> 42:22.988
I've gotta go, Jack.

42:26.946 --> 42:27.632
<i>Five...</i>

42:28.876 --> 42:29.520
<i>Four...</i>

42:30.303 --> 42:30.792
Three...

42:31.324 --> 42:31.863
<i>Two...</i>

42:32.353 --> 42:32.940
<i>One!</i>

42:33.066 --> 42:33.807
<i>Go!</i>

42:34.940 --> 42:35.597
<i>Run!</i>

42:49.983 --> 42:50.767
What the hell?

42:51.200 --> 42:53.200
Jack, what's going on?
Why's it gone dark?

42:53.201 --> 42:55.592
The rift's reverted to
the moment he came through.

42:56.235 --> 42:58.347
Everything's jumped back to
the beginning of the night.

42:58.664 --> 42:59.964
Like you were never here.

43:00.034 --> 43:02.048
Now we've got to avoid ourselves, great!

43:02.104 --> 43:03.587
It's a temporal displacement!

43:03.923 --> 43:06.132
Makes your tongue tingle, doesn't it?
Lovely!

43:06.633 --> 43:07.724
What was in the syringe?

43:07.752 --> 43:09.024
Torchwood DNA.

43:09.164 --> 43:09.780
What?

43:10.101 --> 43:13.654
DNA samples from the five of us,
fused and injected into his heart.

43:13.738 --> 43:16.157
Temporarily corrupted his DNA coding,

43:16.549 --> 43:17.612
confused the disc.

43:17.833 --> 43:20.001
You mean, there's a bit
of all of you inside of me?

43:20.323 --> 43:22.001
Sweet goddesses, that's all I need.

43:22.002 --> 43:23.288
Thank you, Owen.

43:23.344 --> 43:25.176
- You're welcome.
- I want you gone.

43:25.526 --> 43:27.763
Well, we've got to work out
a way to get these off first.

43:27.833 --> 43:28.700
Actually...

43:36.790 --> 43:38.161
Old Artesian trick.

43:38.392 --> 43:40.574
Keep it in the lining of the throat.
Has a lot of uses.

43:41.007 --> 43:44.490
- You had that all along?
- You were my passport to survival.

43:46.462 --> 43:47.678
No hard feelings.

43:48.350 --> 43:50.000
Well, not in that sense.

43:57.308 --> 43:58.930
Remind me never to
get on your bad side.

44:09.435 --> 44:10.792
Definitely bigger.

44:13.953 --> 44:15.659
- If you need a new team member...
- No.

44:15.660 --> 44:16.920
- Really? I could...
- No.

44:17.088 --> 44:18.458
- But...
- No.

44:20.963 --> 44:23.494
Go now, and you can harness
the residual rift energy.

44:24.682 --> 44:26.514
- Listen...
- Goodbye.

44:27.297 --> 44:27.801
OK.

44:45.220 --> 44:45.737
Oh!

44:46.605 --> 44:47.500
By the way...

44:48.353 --> 44:49.332
I meant to tell you...

44:50.381 --> 44:51.374
I found Gray.

45:01.663 --> 45:02.600
Who's Gray?

45:09.370 --> 45:10.154
It's nothing.

45:13.666 --> 45:14.883
Let's get back to work.

45:22.596 --> 45:26.680
<i>Have you never seen something so mad,
so extraordinary,</i>

45:26.681 --> 45:30.330
<i>that just for one second you think that
there might be more out there?</i>

45:30.488 --> 45:31.691
<i>Who are you people?</i>

45:32.054 --> 45:33.901
You're Torchwood, yes?

45:34.082 --> 45:36.460
There's a rift through space
and time that runs through Cardiff,

45:36.461 --> 45:39.888
stuff slips through from other times
and planets and we monitor it.

45:39.944 --> 45:42.364
Stop wasting our time,
we know you're an alien.

45:42.365 --> 45:43.893
There's no such thing as aliens.

45:48.714 --> 45:49.511
Get away from me!

45:49.539 --> 45:51.399
What is it, not spooky enough?

45:58.241 --> 46:01.024
Honestly, it's just sex, sex,
sex with you people.

46:01.150 --> 46:04.129
You have picked the
wrong girl to stalk, mate.

46:05.234 --> 46:06.395
When are the others coming?

46:06.396 --> 46:07.556
<i>They're already here.</i>

46:07.630 --> 46:08.818
<i>Oh my God!</i>

46:08.944 --> 46:10.567
<i>Welcome to Planet Earth.</i>

46:14.358 --> 46:17.154
- Who the hell is this?
- Miss Martha Jones.

46:17.239 --> 46:20.078
A human being who's
travelled in time and space.

46:20.148 --> 46:21.686
You really are something special.

46:22.022 --> 46:23.197
What's happening?

46:23.336 --> 46:24.143
I don't know.

46:24.287 --> 46:26.133
Toshiko, show me the city now.

46:26.245 --> 46:27.336
They're everywhere.

46:27.337 --> 46:29.377
<i>You're the only one who can stop this.</i>

46:29.378 --> 46:32.160
<i>If you don't it's the end of everything.</i>

46:32.161 --> 46:34.020
<i>You always remember what you killed.</i>

46:34.136 --> 46:35.395
Alien Jack?

46:35.968 --> 46:38.290
Nuclear warheads, ten of them.

46:38.332 --> 46:39.912
It's all over.

46:40.094 --> 46:41.548
Let's all have sex.

46:41.842 --> 46:44.150
And I thought the end of the
world couldn't get any worse.

46:46.555 --> 46:47.996
<i>Come on what do we do?</i>

46:48.373 --> 46:51.954
Just keep watching.
Keep doing what we do.
