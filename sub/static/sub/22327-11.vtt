09:05.586 --> 09:06.963

15:41.941 --> 15:44.151
I surrender.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.319
[cries out]

15:45.402 --> 15:47.363
[woman 1] You know what?
I'm gonna call.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.239
[woman 2] That's a good idea. Call 911.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.908
[woman 3] I think he needs some help.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.502
-Hi.
-Hey.

16:01.585 --> 16:04.463
-Are you okay?
-I don't know.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.385
All right. Just tell me what's wrong.
Maybe I can help.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.390
All right, I'll just get right to it.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.810
So, I've been away, and...

16:17.893 --> 16:20.521
you've been home, and that's totally fine.

16:20.604 --> 16:21.438
Yeah.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.609
And I've been learning all this new stuff,

16:25.693 --> 16:27.361
and meeting new friends,

16:27.444 --> 16:29.738
having these experiences,

16:29.822 --> 16:33.325
and it feels good, you know?

16:34.326 --> 16:40.082
But then I come back home
and everything's the same, but it's not.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.043
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.840
-You're breaking up with me.
-No, I'm not.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.427
-Am I?
-Yeah.

16:51.510 --> 16:55.305
You're growing into the woman you're
gonna become, and that's exciting.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.851
No, you don't have to leave.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.770
No, for sure, it's just that
you told me it was an emergency,

17:01.854 --> 17:04.606
so I kind of dropped
everything I was doing.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.484
Yeah, it's an emergency
for our relationship, but...

17:08.485 --> 17:11.280
-I don't even know what I want right now.
-I understand.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.575
You should--
Look, take all the time you need.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.201
You'll make the right decision.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.837
-[keys clacking]
-[Philip over comm]  Boss?

17:28.005 --> 17:29.506
Go ahead.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.676
You're gonna want to see this.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.473
[elevator bell dings]

17:41.769 --> 17:44.563
-Agent MacLaren.
-David, what do you need? I'm just--

17:44.646 --> 17:48.275
Yeah, I just had some questions.
They're mostly about Marcy.

17:48.358 --> 17:51.945
-Mostly?
-All. I'll ride down with you.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.239
[MacLaren clears throat]

17:54.323 --> 17:55.157
[David] Um...

17:57.659 --> 18:00.245
-I wrote them down.
-Yeah, I can see that.

18:00.329 --> 18:04.041
Uh... has Marcy's situation changed
at work?

18:04.124 --> 18:06.085
You know I can't talk about our work.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.378
Right, but in general.
Is she under more stress?

18:08.462 --> 18:10.297
Maybe she's dealing with
a difficult situation?

18:10.380 --> 18:11.507
Let me-- Give this.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.552
"Have I noticed a sudden
personality change?

18:15.636 --> 18:18.347
Is she giving away
any personal possessions?"

18:19.515 --> 18:21.767
This one here seems to be--
that's more of a statement.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.310
What is-- what is this about?

18:24.311 --> 18:26.730
Okay, uh, well,
I've had some training in this,

18:26.814 --> 18:30.567
and recently I've witnessed some signs
of self-destructive behavior.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.153
I'm well aware of what happened,
if that's what you're asking.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.781
-With the tub and the ice?
-I know how that must have looked,

18:35.864 --> 18:38.367
but that wasn't self-destructive.
It was experimental.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.285
-Cutting-edge science.
-It was extremely dangerous.

18:40.369 --> 18:43.038
Look, would I--
would I have approved? No.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.124
Do I understand why she did it?

18:45.958 --> 18:48.794
Yeah, I do. So should you.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.087
[elevator bell dings]

18:50.963 --> 18:51.797
Come on.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.262
[Carly] We have some new information.

18:58.345 --> 19:01.598
Simon was one
of the first travelers-- 004.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.518
His mission was to set up
our communication infrastructure.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.270
So, what happened?

19:06.353 --> 19:09.273
Schizophrenia manifests itself later
in life.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.358
He was sent into a compromised host.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.862
How well do you
understand the internet?

19:14.945 --> 19:17.781
I'm... good with languages.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.827
Okay. Well, broadly speaking,
there are four layers:

19:22.661 --> 19:26.039
application, transport, internet
and physical.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.959
One of the first things
that Simon did when he arrived

19:29.042 --> 19:32.296
was create a whole new physical layer,

19:32.379 --> 19:35.007
a dedicated backbone that piggybacks
off cell phone networks

19:35.090 --> 19:36.341
and communications satellites.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.510
Our back channel in the deep web.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.597
Turns out our back channel
also has layers.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.348
He's watching you.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.267
Vincent's spying on us there, too.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.060
He's using secret layers
in the back channel

19:47.144 --> 19:49.521
for secure communication
and to spy on other travelers.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.814
That's the bad news.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.441
Good news is, now that we know,

19:52.524 --> 19:55.152
we think we could use it against him
to find out where he's hiding.

19:56.486 --> 19:57.487
Show me.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.328
He presented very classically--

20:04.411 --> 20:07.789
persecutory delusions,
fear of authority and surveillance.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.291
The neuroleptics leveled him out,

20:09.374 --> 20:11.460
and we've been working on
the other stuff ever since.

20:13.837 --> 20:17.257
He believes he was sent from the future
on a mission to save the Earth.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.968
He literally doesn't think he's living
in his own body.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.728
The art therapy has been
a successful intervention.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.689
As you know, he's a natural talent.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.824
Simon, you have a visitor.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.703
This is the man I was telling you about.

20:47.287 --> 20:50.123
Hello, Simon,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.261
Dr. Carroll.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.683
Would it be possible for me
to speak with Simon alone?

21:07.766 --> 21:10.394
No, you wouldn't be in danger,
if that's what you're worried about.

21:10.477 --> 21:13.939
I'd like to talk about his work,
and I want him to feel free to open up.

21:14.940 --> 21:18.193
Well, I suppose I could go
grab us some coffees.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.823
Simon, will you be nice to our visitor?

21:22.906 --> 21:26.159
Mr. Ingram is a close friend
of the institution.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.203
[Vincent chuckles]

21:31.915 --> 21:33.417
You're not supposed to be here.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.211
Simon, you heard what Dr. Carroll said.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.046
You were supposed to die
in the North Tower.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.760
-You know who I am?
-I know that voice.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.763
We searched for it for years.

21:46.847 --> 21:50.600
Then you also know that I'm important
to the program, Simon.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.853
I'm the very first traveler.

21:52.936 --> 21:56.023
The Director is not happy.
You were supposed to die.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.107
Not anymore.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.235
The Director gave me a new mission.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.320
What mission?

22:01.403 --> 22:03.655
The Director feels terrible
for what happened to you

22:03.739 --> 22:04.865
and wants to fix it.

22:05.574 --> 22:06.992
It sent me to help you.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.955
We're going to make you
whole again, Simon.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.962
There are 16 continental switches
on the back channel,

22:19.046 --> 22:20.922
but only four that handle
sub-channel traffic.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.384
Simon helped me set up alerts
to log any suspicious network activity.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.761
So, what are we looking at?

22:25.844 --> 22:27.971
This is Vincent communicating
with somebody last night.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.307
-With who?
-We don't know.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.393
-What does it say?
-We don't know that, either.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.686
So, where's it going?

22:35.145 --> 22:36.688
We don't know where it was sent
or received.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.774
Hops are encrypted
along the sub-channels

22:38.857 --> 22:40.567
as well as both ends of the pipe.

22:40.650 --> 22:41.693
Except for this one.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.654
He's getting a call.

22:44.738 --> 22:45.906
Well, grab it.

22:45.989 --> 22:49.451
Looks like the access point is unsecure.
We might be getting a phone number.

22:49.534 --> 22:50.368
[cell phone vibrating]

22:50.452 --> 22:51.286
[woman] Come on, Pepper.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.626
This isn't the last phone I sent you.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.712
Those phones are meant
for your safety as well as mine.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.673
[woman]  I can't find that one.
And this won't take long.

23:04.758 --> 23:08.053
Vincent, you need
a more thorough treatment regimen,

23:08.136 --> 23:11.389
one that at least allows
for the possibility of medication.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.475
No, I don't need drugs,
I just need to talk,

23:13.558 --> 23:14.935
and we have an appointment.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.436
And I'm calling to cancel it.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.521
That is unacceptable.

23:17.604 --> 23:18.855
Vincent, I'm sorry.

23:18.939 --> 23:19.940
-I can recommend--
-No.

23:20.023 --> 23:21.608
I don't want to talk with anyone else.

23:21.691 --> 23:25.112
I just want to talk with you,
and I will, just as we agreed.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.363
Goodbye, Vincent.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.073
Please don't contact me again.

23:28.824 --> 23:29.658
[beeps]

23:32.911 --> 23:35.831
-Call's over.
-Got the originating number.

23:35.914 --> 23:39.126
Good. I gotta get back to the Bureau.
You track down that location.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.585
Everybody else, protocol five.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.587
The minute we find out
where Vincent is hiding,

23:42.671 --> 23:45.340
we're gonna knock down
his fucking door.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.175
Hey, Carly, hold up.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.093
What?

23:49.636 --> 23:51.972
I was thinking maybe you could stay.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.181
For?

23:53.265 --> 23:54.266
Protection.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.684
[Simon clears throat]

23:55.767 --> 23:56.768
I gotta pee.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.524
Think you got this. Bye, Phil.

24:05.986 --> 24:09.364
Oh, Mr. Ingram. Mr. Ingram!

24:09.447 --> 24:11.575
I'm so glad I caught you.

24:11.658 --> 24:12.868
I just wanted to thank you

24:12.951 --> 24:15.328
for the personal interest you've taken
in Simon's care.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.663
Oh, I'm happy to help.

24:16.746 --> 24:18.790
But I'd also like to talk to you

24:18.874 --> 24:21.126
about all the equipment
you've been bringing in.

24:21.209 --> 24:23.420
Surplus electronic parts
from my various companies.

24:23.503 --> 24:25.422
Most of it isn't even functional.

24:25.505 --> 24:29.593
Still, Simon's convinced
it'll help with his...

24:29.676 --> 24:31.803
his consciousness issues.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.305
Is that what he's saying now?

24:33.388 --> 24:36.391
Of course, the problem is
we have procedure to follow--

24:36.474 --> 24:39.227
safety and compliance,
various approval committees.

24:39.311 --> 24:42.397
I understand.
These things are expensive and take time.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.736
Hopefully, this will address
the first problem.

24:48.820 --> 24:51.448
Perhaps you can help me with the second.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.543
This is very generous.

25:03.627 --> 25:04.836
Not at all.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.547
Charity is a gift you give yourself.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.969
Have a nice weekend, Doctor.

25:35.575 --> 25:36.409
Marcy?

25:36.493 --> 25:37.827
In here!

25:41.748 --> 25:42.832
I'm making dinner.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.377
Really?

25:47.003 --> 25:49.339
I just-- I've never seen you cook before.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.424
Well, it's dinner, David.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.176
It's not brain surgery.

25:59.641 --> 26:00.767
It's pasta.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.477
Yeah.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.272
How long has this been on?

26:05.355 --> 26:07.565
Uh, not long enough
to boil some the water yet.

26:09.192 --> 26:11.820
Yeah, there's definitely still water
in there.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.949
I had a late lunch, so there's no rush.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.130
You surprise me every time you do that.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.730
[keys clacking]

26:46.813 --> 26:48.565
[elevator bell dings]

26:55.447 --> 26:57.949
Shit. I'm sorry.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.242
You're avoiding me.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.161
No, I just-- I'm just-- I'm--

27:01.244 --> 27:02.871
I see it when you look at me.

27:03.872 --> 27:07.208
I remind you of what happened,
and I'm not taking it personally.

27:07.834 --> 27:10.420
But it does convince me
that we need this.

27:11.504 --> 27:12.964
Takeout?

27:13.048 --> 27:14.466
This is caponata.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.969
This is moussaka. That's for me.

27:18.053 --> 27:21.723
And this is Mexican, because there are
no Spanish places around here.

27:23.224 --> 27:24.225
Ah...

27:24.309 --> 27:26.019
We just sold our house,

27:26.102 --> 27:28.188
and you have a ton of vacation saved,

27:28.271 --> 27:31.191
so, Palermo...

27:31.274 --> 27:32.692
Santorini...

27:32.776 --> 27:34.110
Barcelona.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.905
You need a break, Grant. We both do.

27:36.988 --> 27:40.325
We take off for a couple of months,
spend a ridiculous amount of money

27:40.408 --> 27:43.119
and hit reset on our entire life.

27:45.497 --> 27:49.292
That would be... incredible.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.506
But you can't imagine leaving work
for that long.

27:54.589 --> 27:56.049
-No--
-I know.

27:58.968 --> 28:02.013
Which is why I started thinking
about a different plan,

28:02.097 --> 28:04.682
one that costs just as much and...

28:05.350 --> 28:08.353
[sighs] will definitely reset the hell out
of everything.

28:11.898 --> 28:12.732
Adoption.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.443
It's too soon to be diving in,
I know, but...

28:15.527 --> 28:17.654
we could at least start talking about it.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.284
Never would have occurred to me.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.912
Meaning... what?

28:28.331 --> 28:30.166
Meaning I think it's a good idea.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.973
[door opens]

28:45.056 --> 28:46.224
[Jeff] Carly.

28:46.307 --> 28:47.809
[door closes]

28:47.892 --> 28:49.728
[sing-song] Carly.

28:52.647 --> 28:54.065
[Carly] What?

28:54.149 --> 28:55.483
What is this?

28:55.984 --> 28:57.068
Are you drunk?

28:57.152 --> 28:59.320
Yeah, I mean, I had a couple drinks.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.240
What do you want? You want me
to disrespect my boss on his birthday?

29:02.323 --> 29:04.159
Okay, Jeffrey's sleeping,
and you're drunk.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.953
-I'm not dealing with this right now.
-[laughs]

29:07.036 --> 29:08.413
Oh, you're not dealing right now.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.999
How long are you gonna hang this
over my head?

29:11.082 --> 29:13.501
Come on. I've been good,
and you know it.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.088
Plus, you were the one
that was sleeping around.

29:17.172 --> 29:20.383
-Okay. Get out.
-I'm not going anywhere.

29:20.467 --> 29:23.428
-Touch me again, Jeff.
-Hey, come on, I've been good.

29:23.511 --> 29:26.431
-You owe me.
-Owe you? [scoffs]

29:28.016 --> 29:30.351
Am I gonna get some or what?

29:30.435 --> 29:33.354
Never, Jeff. Not now, not ever.

29:34.981 --> 29:38.109
[Carly cries out] Stop it.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.361
-[Carly grunts]
-[Jeff groans]

29:42.614 --> 29:44.699
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

29:47.452 --> 29:48.536
[Carly grunts]

29:50.121 --> 29:52.248
[panting] Stay down.

29:52.332 --> 29:53.750
Shouldn't have done that.

29:54.751 --> 29:55.960
[Jeff groans]

30:00.173 --> 30:01.341
[Carly] Unh!

30:03.218 --> 30:06.596
[both grunting and panting]

30:06.679 --> 30:07.722
[groans]

30:17.982 --> 30:20.819
[grunting] Stay down!

30:20.902 --> 30:23.029
I said stay down!

31:16.291 --> 31:17.125
Morning.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.085
Hi.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.882
Were you watching me sleep?

31:24.465 --> 31:26.593
-You try looking at yourself sometime.
-[chuckles]

31:26.676 --> 31:29.429
-It's hard not to.
-You're ridiculous.

31:29.512 --> 31:30.930
I am ridiculous.

31:34.517 --> 31:35.768
I'm glad you stayed.

31:36.436 --> 31:40.148
Well, this place is much cozier
than the place I've been staying, so...

31:41.733 --> 31:44.652
-Are you using me for my duvet?
-[chuckling]

31:48.531 --> 31:51.326
I'm sorry it's taken me
so long to find my way back.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.162
Well, to be fair...

31:55.914 --> 31:57.957
I was kind of playing hard to get.

32:00.335 --> 32:03.838
-[laughs]
-So, help me understand.

32:05.381 --> 32:09.427
How could whatever it was
you were doing make things better?

32:10.011 --> 32:12.931
I mean, even if you can't tell me
the top secret details.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.891
Well, for example,

32:14.974 --> 32:17.143
do you remember when we played
the Operation game

32:17.226 --> 32:19.062
and you said you were
a better doctor than me?

32:21.981 --> 32:23.316
'Cause I do.

32:23.399 --> 32:25.026
-You do?
-Mm-hmm.

32:25.109 --> 32:28.196
There's a lot of things that I...
I remember.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.782
Most of which I can't tell you, but...

32:32.200 --> 32:33.952
I can tell you that...

32:34.953 --> 32:36.371
I love you.

32:39.374 --> 32:42.001
You have no idea how happy
that makes me.

32:43.544 --> 32:46.172
Do you remember
that you owe me $20?

32:46.881 --> 32:48.758
Oh, uh, I'll go get it.

32:48.841 --> 32:50.927
Oh, no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[laughing]

32:52.178 --> 32:53.721
I wonder if that pasta's ready.

32:56.057 --> 32:56.891
Probably.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.559
[laughing]

32:58.643 --> 32:59.644
[door opens]

33:00.812 --> 33:02.814
[Carly] Hey, look, you survived.

33:02.897 --> 33:03.731
Yeah.

33:05.108 --> 33:07.318
He started seeing Vincent again
in the night, but...

33:08.319 --> 33:10.029
at least I got him to start wearing pants.

33:10.113 --> 33:10.947
Mm-hmm.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.449
How about you?
How are things at home?

33:14.200 --> 33:15.326
I knew it.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.244
Ow.

33:16.327 --> 33:17.745
That wasn't a random call.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.123
What? I was up, I was bored.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.959
Bullshit. You knew something
was gonna happen.

33:23.042 --> 33:24.085
How? That's impossible.

33:24.168 --> 33:26.379
I don't know how. But you knew.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.132
The timing was too perfect.

33:29.215 --> 33:31.759
-No.
-What was I going to do?

33:32.343 --> 33:33.428
Was I gonna go to jail?

33:36.431 --> 33:37.640
Was I gonna kill him?

33:40.852 --> 33:41.894
How is Jeff?

33:45.148 --> 33:46.149
He'll live.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.610
Probably won't even remember it.

33:49.694 --> 33:50.820
So, what are you gonna do?

33:52.905 --> 33:54.407
Hey. You got something?

33:57.493 --> 34:00.204
The phone that called Vincent
was a burner, paid for in cash.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.497
No user info.

34:01.581 --> 34:04.542
But I was able to use its IMEI
along with cell tower data

34:04.625 --> 34:06.461
to find the neighborhood
that it was last used.

34:06.544 --> 34:07.712
[Trevor] Fancy part of town.

34:07.795 --> 34:08.629
Right.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.798
Which made this next part easier.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.301
Most people who live in this area
are upstanding citizens

34:13.384 --> 34:15.511
who have actual names attached
to their phones.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.847
Narrow the search to nameless devices,

34:17.930 --> 34:19.932
and our list drops close to zero.

34:20.892 --> 34:24.228
Simon and I spent the night checking
security footage at these locations,

34:24.312 --> 34:25.938
came up with our prime suspect.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.523
Katrina Perrow.

34:27.607 --> 34:32.320
Specializes in treating panic disorders,
social anxiety and agoraphobia.

34:32.403 --> 34:35.073
Text me the address.
Carly, you're with me.

34:35.156 --> 34:35.990
Yep.

34:36.991 --> 34:39.786
[Vincent] You've been given
every resource to make this work!

34:39.869 --> 34:40.995
[Simon] We need more time.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.289
We need to be operating
at the exascale, minimum.

34:43.372 --> 34:44.207
The meteor--

34:44.290 --> 34:45.958
[Vincent] I told you! I told you--

34:46.042 --> 34:48.044
I keep telling you--

34:48.127 --> 34:50.379
the meteor doesn't happen for years.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.298
Then we find another way, right?

34:53.299 --> 34:55.635
Look, we've got the node clusters,
the math libraries.

34:55.718 --> 34:57.762
We just need a qubit engine
and a field generator.

34:57.845 --> 34:59.972
-Where are we going to get that, Simon?
-The Director!

35:00.056 --> 35:02.433
-Ohhh... this was a mistake.
-No!

35:02.517 --> 35:05.228
-I've wasted so much time.
-No, we just need the plans.

35:05.311 --> 35:08.648
-No, we're finished here.
-We've hurt so many people!

35:08.731 --> 35:10.233
We hurt Marcy.

35:12.735 --> 35:14.946
Just ask the Director for the materials.

35:16.322 --> 35:18.157
Ask the Director!

35:52.942 --> 35:56.946
[Philip] Why didn't the Director help him,
afterwards, I mean?

35:57.029 --> 35:58.281
Why did it abandon him?

35:59.991 --> 36:02.827
Probably for the same reason
it sent my consciousness--

36:02.910 --> 36:06.038
well, yours too, for that matter--
into a compromised host.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.040
It didn't know.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.627
No records from the institution
made it out of the 21st.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.213
Vincent covered his tracks.

36:15.214 --> 36:16.799
[Simon] I want to go home.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.801
What's that?

36:20.595 --> 36:22.096
Can I go home now?

36:25.057 --> 36:26.475
-Can I ask about--
-No.

36:28.394 --> 36:29.812
Dr. Perrow?

36:32.023 --> 36:33.649
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.484
This is my associate, Carly Shannon.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.945
We'd like to speak to you
about one of your patients.

36:40.364 --> 36:43.367
The FBI has been monitoring Vincent Ingram
for some time.

36:43.451 --> 36:45.369
We know
all about his paranoid delusions,

36:45.453 --> 36:47.663
and, unfortunately,
he's starting to act on them.

36:47.747 --> 36:48.956
-He's hurt someone?
-Yes.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.499
And we believe it will continue.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.794
I didn't know.
I would have reported it.

36:53.878 --> 36:55.087
None of that matters now.

36:55.171 --> 36:57.173
We're just interested in stopping him.

36:57.256 --> 37:00.343
[sighs] Our professional
relationship deteriorated.

37:00.426 --> 37:02.553
I just called him
to cancel an appointment.

37:02.637 --> 37:05.973
We're aware of your phone call.
We want you to keep that appointment.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.517
What? Why?

37:08.601 --> 37:10.353
Ingram is in hiding.

37:11.854 --> 37:14.273
So... you want me to keep my appointment,

37:14.357 --> 37:15.775
and you're gonna follow me?

37:15.858 --> 37:17.068
We have a device.

37:17.151 --> 37:18.861
It's completely untraceable,

37:18.945 --> 37:21.656
but it will allow us to be
in constant communication.

37:22.323 --> 37:23.532
You mean like a wire?

37:24.158 --> 37:27.370
Little more high tech than that.
Will you help us?

37:29.538 --> 37:31.165
I just got out of a board meeting,

37:31.249 --> 37:33.751
and they told me that you are
withdrawing funding.

37:33.834 --> 37:35.836
I told them that this must be
some kind of mistake.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.129
It's not a mistake.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.631
Well, at least give us more time.

37:38.714 --> 37:40.925
A more gradual reduction of funds
would allow us to--

37:41.008 --> 37:43.010
I'm sorry, I've made my decision.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.763
The institute has come to rely
on your generosity.

37:46.347 --> 37:48.057
Whole programs will be shuttered.

37:48.474 --> 37:50.101
And what about the patients?

37:50.184 --> 37:52.395
A lot of them will be put out
on the street.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.897
Well, then,
it's fortunate you care so much,

37:54.981 --> 37:58.567
and I've been able to compensate you
so well over the years.

37:58.651 --> 38:01.320
You can take my place as benefactor.

38:13.916 --> 38:17.003
All right. This should be enough
to last you for a while.

38:17.712 --> 38:21.215
Give us a call when you need more.
You know how to find us, okay?

38:22.717 --> 38:26.262
-I'm glad it worked, Marcy.
-Glad what worked?

38:28.848 --> 38:31.267
The device in room 21C.

38:33.519 --> 38:36.355
I thought you were gone forever,
but then you got better.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.359
Maybe I can get better, too.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.158
Come here. Take care of yourself, okay?

39:00.254 --> 39:01.964
[engine turns over]

39:10.306 --> 39:13.100
[Philip over comm]  Okay,
the car's approaching now. Good luck.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.009
All right, she's leaving the city.

39:47.093 --> 39:48.552
Signal looks good.

39:49.637 --> 39:52.765
[Trevor] Yeah, we see that, too.
Following at a safe distance.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.361
[beeps]

40:05.444 --> 40:07.446
[Carly over comm]
Dr. Perrow, you activated your comm.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.532
-Everything all right?
-It's fine.

40:09.615 --> 40:11.242
[Carly] We're right behind you.

40:11.325 --> 40:13.577
All you need to do is lead us there.
We'll do the rest.

40:18.624 --> 40:21.043
It's a... fine day out there.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.787
[no audible dialogue]

41:07.089 --> 41:08.340
[MacLaren] There it is.

41:08.424 --> 41:09.884
[Trevor] GPS says she's inside.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.178
[Carly] I was gonna say,
we need to deactivate the cameras,

41:12.261 --> 41:13.387
but I don't see any.

41:14.221 --> 41:17.016
In fact, I don't even think
the barn has any power.

41:17.099 --> 41:19.310
Makes sense, if you want
to hide from the Director.

41:19.393 --> 41:22.563
Why do these things always end up
in barns?

41:28.652 --> 41:31.489
[chickens clucking]

41:40.122 --> 41:43.167
-Philip, you got Perrow's comm?
- She's holding position.

42:46.063 --> 42:48.107
[crying]

42:48.190 --> 42:51.443
This is a message
for Agent Grant MacLaren.

42:52.069 --> 42:55.906
I was acting on Agent MacLaren's behalf

42:56.156 --> 42:58.325
in an unsanctioned operation.

42:59.660 --> 43:00.786
I was found out...

43:02.580 --> 43:05.457
and will be released unharmed...

43:08.794 --> 43:10.254
along with my daughter...

43:13.424 --> 43:15.676
as long as Agent MacLaren

43:15.759 --> 43:18.762
presents himself to these coordinates

43:18.846 --> 43:20.848
in the next two hours.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.934
He must come alone...

43:24.768 --> 43:26.270
and on time...

43:26.895 --> 43:29.106
or I will never be heard from again.

43:31.984 --> 43:32.818
[continues sobbing]
