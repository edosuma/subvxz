00:10.255 --> 00:12.546
( theme music playing )

00:40.172 --> 00:41.671
( lock beeps )

00:52.880 --> 00:55.546
- Darn it all.
- Elder, please.

00:55.546 --> 00:57.755
Sorry,
it's just--

00:59.838 --> 01:01.713
it's exhausting.

01:01.713 --> 01:04.588
Is it just me
or do they seem to be
getting more mean lately?

01:04.588 --> 01:06.546
I think it's just been
a long day.

01:08.089 --> 01:11.214
( huffs )
A lot of long days.

01:11.214 --> 01:12.713
Long months.

01:15.214 --> 01:18.922
I heard Elder Cade
and Elder Jason
didn't get any.

01:18.922 --> 01:19.838
We'll get one.

01:22.630 --> 01:25.047
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I believe.

01:26.755 --> 01:28.463
I believed
we'd get a ton.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.255
You know,
just because they don't
convert right in front of us

01:30.255 --> 01:32.089
doesn't mean they're
not gonna convert.

01:32.089 --> 01:34.671
I mean, maybe down the line,
they'll come around.

01:34.671 --> 01:36.130
- ( urinating )
- I know. I remember.

01:37.838 --> 01:39.546
I'm just saying
it's a long process,

01:39.546 --> 01:40.588
so don't get down,
Elder.

01:40.588 --> 01:42.588
I'm not down.

01:42.588 --> 01:46.172
- I guess
I'm just starting to...
- ( toilet flushes )

01:46.172 --> 01:50.588
I think we started something
very real and promising with
Sister Halfon the other day.

01:50.588 --> 01:53.130
I think with steady work
and dedication,

01:53.130 --> 01:55.297
she could be
our very first convert.

01:55.297 --> 01:56.755
Really?

01:56.755 --> 01:58.421
I mean, we were there
for over an hour and a half.

01:58.421 --> 02:00.089
She was obviously
engaged.

02:00.089 --> 02:02.713
She was definitely
interested.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.089
What are you
insinuating?

02:07.671 --> 02:09.630
She was hot
for you, Elder.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.588
- Stop. Stop it.
- What? I didn't say
anything bad.

02:12.588 --> 02:14.588
- Okay, but you're
thinking it.
- Oh, come on.

02:14.588 --> 02:16.130
You don't have
those kinds of thoughts?

02:16.130 --> 02:18.130
If I do, I just don't
entertain them at all.

02:18.130 --> 02:19.505
What do you do, then?

02:19.505 --> 02:21.963
I pray to Heavenly Father.
( spits )

02:24.588 --> 02:26.797
- What? I do.
- Okay, I'm just saying

02:26.797 --> 02:28.797
if I was you
and Sister Halfon was
looking at me like that,

02:28.797 --> 02:30.546
I'd have a hard time
focusing on my prayers.

02:30.546 --> 02:31.838
All right, well,
if you don't mind,

02:31.838 --> 02:33.588
I'd like to do
just that right now, okay?

02:33.588 --> 02:35.172
Let's pray
to the Heavenly Father

02:35.172 --> 02:36.797
and ask for His
intervention and help,

02:36.797 --> 02:39.130
and hopefully
we can get one convert.

02:40.421 --> 02:41.797
At least one.

02:54.463 --> 02:56.838
It doesn't
bother you?

02:56.838 --> 02:57.838
What?

02:59.880 --> 03:02.380
- ( sighs )
- That we've asked God for help
for so many straight days

03:02.380 --> 03:05.047
and He hasn't
helped us yet.

03:05.047 --> 03:08.339
Like I said,
conversions don't just
happen on the spot.

03:08.339 --> 03:09.963
I heard you, but...

03:11.546 --> 03:12.963
don't you ever have...

03:17.172 --> 03:18.214
doubts?

03:19.755 --> 03:21.630
What do you mean
by doubts?

03:21.630 --> 03:23.671
I mean...

03:23.671 --> 03:25.130
You know
what I mean.

03:25.130 --> 03:26.755
I don't think
that I do, Elder.

03:26.755 --> 03:29.838
- What do you mean
by doubts?
- Well,

03:29.838 --> 03:32.838
I'm not sure this isn't
a big waste of time.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.255
Nobody wants
to talk to us.

03:37.797 --> 03:40.172
We're spending so much
of our own money.

03:42.630 --> 03:46.255
Couldn't we have
helped a lot of people
with that money?

03:46.255 --> 03:48.172
Wouldn't that be better
spent someplace else?

03:48.172 --> 03:50.838
Like go to an orphanage
and give it to the
children there.

03:52.255 --> 03:53.421
Hmm.

03:53.421 --> 03:56.505
And look, I'm--
I'm 20 years old

03:56.505 --> 03:58.047
and I have urges.

03:58.047 --> 04:00.297
I feel them.

04:00.297 --> 04:02.546
Is that a sin?

04:02.546 --> 04:07.421
Why would He
create those urges
in the first place?

04:07.421 --> 04:09.214
( panting )

04:09.214 --> 04:10.089
And...

04:12.588 --> 04:14.588
darn it all.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.255
I had coffee.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.089
You--

04:18.089 --> 04:19.755
you what?!

04:19.755 --> 04:21.172
It was at the free
Holiday Inn buffet.

04:21.172 --> 04:23.130
It was last month.
I tried it.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.713
I can't believe--
I can't believe this!

04:24.713 --> 04:26.922
- Why did you do that?
- It was delicious, Joseph.

04:26.922 --> 04:29.047
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
You need to pray
for forgiveness.

04:29.047 --> 04:30.421
Right now.
Here, I'll pray with you.

04:30.421 --> 04:31.755
I don't wanna pray
for forgiveness.

04:31.755 --> 04:33.255
Well, what do you
wanna pray for?

04:33.255 --> 04:34.505
Maybe I don't feel
like praying.

04:34.505 --> 04:36.505
Uh, well, I think
you should start praying

04:36.505 --> 04:38.588
because you drank coffee
and you're talking about

04:38.588 --> 04:40.463
- really strange urges.
- Fine, then.

04:42.963 --> 04:45.297
I'll pray
for a sign.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.130
- A sign?
- Yes.

04:49.130 --> 04:51.546
That this is
the true path.

04:54.130 --> 04:55.505
Okay, then.

04:55.505 --> 04:57.755
- Okay?
- Yeah.

04:57.755 --> 05:00.297
Let's pray for a sign,
then, together.

05:01.797 --> 05:03.172
Good.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.339
Should we consult
our scripture?

05:05.339 --> 05:06.755
Yes.

05:10.421 --> 05:11.671
All right.
( sighs )

05:14.130 --> 05:16.421
- ( TV turns on )
- ( woman moaning )

05:17.838 --> 05:18.755
Yeah.

05:36.214 --> 05:37.588
What was that?

05:39.130 --> 05:40.963
Um...

05:40.963 --> 05:42.838
I believe
that was, um...

05:44.172 --> 05:45.339
pornography.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.505
Joseph, do you know
what this means?!

05:48.505 --> 05:49.838
We prayed for
a sign from God,

05:49.838 --> 05:51.922
and pornography appeared
on our television set!

05:51.922 --> 05:54.963
No, actually-- I actually
didn't start praying yet,
so that's impossible.

05:54.963 --> 05:58.546
- Come on, don't deny this!
- All right, there must be
some kind of explanation here.

05:58.546 --> 06:00.588
Here, like--

06:00.588 --> 06:02.339
oh, hmm, see?

06:02.339 --> 06:04.130
It was the television remote
that was under the pillows.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.797
That must've turned on
the pornography.

06:05.797 --> 06:08.005
Right at the exact moment
we asked Heavenly Father
for a sign.

06:08.005 --> 06:09.963
The exact spot
you sat down!

06:09.963 --> 06:11.297
Okay,
Heavenly Father

06:11.297 --> 06:13.630
would not send us
pornography as a sign.

06:13.630 --> 06:15.671
- How do you know?
- Because I think I know
Heavenly Father

06:15.671 --> 06:17.838
- well enough to know that.
- But do you really?

06:17.838 --> 06:19.546
Yeah.

06:22.255 --> 06:24.838
I mean,
what kind of sign
would that even be?

06:26.214 --> 06:28.047
I don't know,
but I'm excited

06:28.047 --> 06:29.713
to discuss
and explore with you.

06:34.421 --> 06:36.546
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.

06:37.671 --> 06:38.797
Absolutely not.

06:38.797 --> 06:40.546
Okay,
I'm just gonna...

06:42.963 --> 06:47.047
And just-- just...
( groans )

06:47.047 --> 06:49.713
Here, cover it.

06:51.297 --> 06:53.005
Like this.

06:53.005 --> 06:53.880
And then it's--

06:57.505 --> 06:58.963
- There.
- Relax!

06:58.963 --> 07:01.380
- Now it's all...
- Everything's okay.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.797
Everything's okay?!
Everything's okay?

07:02.797 --> 07:04.255
We just watched
pornography.

07:04.255 --> 07:05.755
We watched pornography
and you drank coffee.

07:05.755 --> 07:07.421
I don't know
what's happening to us.

07:07.421 --> 07:09.297
Everything is not okay.
Everything is absolutely
not okay.

07:11.089 --> 07:13.172
- Okay-- okay, um...
- ( exhales )

07:13.172 --> 07:15.130
( hyperventilating )

07:15.130 --> 07:16.880
- ( cries )
- Relax, it's okay.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.130
Listen to me,
you're okay.

07:22.089 --> 07:24.588
You didn't do
anything wrong.
It's no big deal.

07:24.588 --> 07:28.130
( panting, muttering )

07:30.588 --> 07:32.047
There.

07:40.463 --> 07:42.630
( grunts )

07:44.505 --> 07:46.172
- You okay?
- Yeah.

07:46.172 --> 07:48.380
Yeah, I'm fine.
Why?

07:48.380 --> 07:50.463
- I don't know.
- I don't know either.

07:50.463 --> 07:53.005
Why'd you ask--
ask if I'm okay
if I'm obviously okay?

07:54.546 --> 07:57.297
- Okay, you're okay.
- Yeah, I'm okay.

07:57.297 --> 07:58.713
I just sort of--
you know,

07:58.713 --> 08:02.630
I just get tired
of sitting on one bed.

08:02.630 --> 08:05.214
So bored of that,
so I jump to the other one.

08:05.214 --> 08:08.671
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna go
take a shower.

08:10.797 --> 08:12.755
( music playing )

08:16.089 --> 08:17.963
( shower running )

08:35.255 --> 08:36.880
( water stops )

08:44.005 --> 08:46.838
Are we starting with
the Arena Subdivision
tomorrow?

08:46.838 --> 08:49.505
Um, sure.

08:57.214 --> 08:59.505
Do you have a clean
garment top I can borrow?

09:00.671 --> 09:02.630
Yes, I do.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.630
You mad at me?

09:22.630 --> 09:24.380
Why would
I be mad at you?

09:28.047 --> 09:30.546
I didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

09:30.546 --> 09:32.255
Oh, I'm not uncomfortable.
You're my friend,

09:32.255 --> 09:34.380
and when you stray,
I help you get back
on the path.

09:38.797 --> 09:40.380
I'm not sure
that's what happened.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.130
Sure, it is.

09:42.130 --> 09:43.713
You were
having doubts

09:43.713 --> 09:45.546
and I helped you
reconfirm your faith.

09:46.797 --> 09:48.546
'Cause I don't have
any doubts.

09:52.463 --> 09:54.671
Okay, well,

09:54.671 --> 09:56.546
I'm gonna go to sleep.

09:56.546 --> 09:58.089
See you
in the morning, Elder.

09:58.089 --> 09:59.755
See you
in the morning.

10:11.047 --> 10:13.089
- ( crickets chirping )
- ( electricity buzzing )

10:24.713 --> 10:26.089
( lock beeps )

10:35.297 --> 10:37.463
Noah:
What are you doing?

10:39.838 --> 10:42.047
Elder Jensen,
you left me?

10:42.047 --> 10:43.671
I know,
I'm sorry.

10:44.922 --> 10:46.505
What's going on?

11:07.797 --> 11:09.630
( clears throat )

11:16.838 --> 11:20.172
- How'd you get it?
- He didn't even ask
for my identification.

11:20.172 --> 11:21.797
I could've been
anyone.

11:21.797 --> 11:24.005
( both laughing )

11:29.463 --> 11:31.214
Okay.

11:31.214 --> 11:33.047
So, for argument's sake,

11:33.047 --> 11:36.838
let's say that
the pornography was a sign.

11:39.005 --> 11:40.380
Okay.

11:40.380 --> 11:43.047
To me, that can
only mean one thing--

11:43.047 --> 11:45.339
St. Augustine.

11:47.546 --> 11:50.130
- Who?
- Oh, he was a saint
from the Catholic faith.

11:50.130 --> 11:52.505
He was
a very real sinner.

11:54.172 --> 11:57.546
What-- what were
his sins?

11:57.546 --> 11:59.214
Every sin
you can think of.

12:00.713 --> 12:03.588
But he was on a very similar
conversion crusade to ours,

12:03.588 --> 12:06.047
and when he finally found God
and he repented,

12:06.047 --> 12:09.047
he became one
of the greatest saints
of all time.

12:15.214 --> 12:16.421
Because
he had sinned.

12:17.505 --> 12:19.880
Right,
because he had sinned.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.546
( chuckles )

12:54.130 --> 12:56.089
( music playing )

13:06.755 --> 13:08.255
So then
over the loudspeaker,
I just hear,

13:08.255 --> 13:10.922
"Keep your hands and feet
inside the ride."

13:10.922 --> 13:12.421
And I was just like,
"Oh, no."

13:12.421 --> 13:14.380
I wanted to put
my hands up in the ride.

13:14.380 --> 13:15.797
- What did you do?
- So I waited until
we got to the top.

13:15.797 --> 13:17.255
It was like...
( ticking )

13:17.255 --> 13:18.671
As soon
as we got to the top,
I look over to see

13:18.671 --> 13:20.047
if no one was looking,
and I was like...

13:20.047 --> 13:21.588
- No!
- I just put my hands up.

13:21.588 --> 13:23.172
And I was like,
"Am I gonna get arrested?"

13:33.130 --> 13:35.005
( both giggling )

13:37.297 --> 13:39.047
Woman on TV:
Oh, yeah, I definitely
fuck for money,

13:39.047 --> 13:40.963
but I also do it
for fun.

13:40.963 --> 13:42.755
- Man on TV: Why is that?
- Well, because I'm great
at it.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.630
- Oh, really?
- Uh-huh.

13:44.630 --> 13:46.421
Man:
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

13:46.421 --> 13:48.588
Maybe you should
pull over this taxi
and find out.

13:48.588 --> 13:50.255
Man:
Oh, you're gonna show me?

13:50.255 --> 13:51.838
Woman:
I'll show you.

13:54.463 --> 13:57.130
( woman giggles,
moans )

13:57.130 --> 13:59.214
- Whoa.
- ( clears throat )

13:59.214 --> 14:01.505
- Wow.
- ( woman panting )

14:02.671 --> 14:04.505
Yeah.

14:04.505 --> 14:07.047
( both moaning )

14:12.463 --> 14:14.339
- Man: Oh, yeah.
- Woman: Yeah.

14:16.630 --> 14:18.214
( woman moaning )

14:21.297 --> 14:23.463
( man moaning )

14:25.630 --> 14:27.047
Woman:
Yeah.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.297
Woman:
Yeah.

14:44.255 --> 14:46.214
I saw Sister Wilber's
vagina once...

14:46.214 --> 14:48.089
- Yeah?
- ...after church.

14:48.089 --> 14:49.838
( grunts )

14:49.838 --> 14:51.214
( pants )

14:51.214 --> 14:52.963
I helped her
into her car

14:52.963 --> 14:55.005
and I saw it
through her underwear.

14:55.005 --> 14:56.588
- You did?
- Yes.

14:56.588 --> 14:59.005
It was awesome.

14:59.005 --> 15:01.214
I imagined what
it would feel like.

15:02.505 --> 15:04.172
Like a peach.

15:04.172 --> 15:05.588
( both moan )

15:05.588 --> 15:09.214
To place my parts
on her part...

15:09.214 --> 15:10.713
( gasps )

15:10.713 --> 15:12.005
( groans )

15:12.005 --> 15:13.838
Darn it all!

15:13.838 --> 15:15.713
Oh, oh, my gosh.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.880
( panting )

15:23.755 --> 15:25.463
( woman moaning )

15:28.089 --> 15:29.588
( groans )

15:29.588 --> 15:32.255
- ( woman moans )
- ( Joseph shudders )

15:37.172 --> 15:38.588
( TV turns off )

16:09.172 --> 16:10.505
Hey, Elder?

16:12.130 --> 16:13.671
( whispers )
Yeah?

16:13.671 --> 16:16.463
Is this normal?

16:19.005 --> 16:21.089
We didn't break
something?

16:22.630 --> 16:24.297
I don't think so.

16:36.005 --> 16:37.963
( birds chirping )

16:52.047 --> 16:53.671
( lock beeps,
door opens )

16:55.463 --> 16:56.630
Yay,
you're awake!

16:56.630 --> 16:59.546
- Yeah.
- Guess what.

16:59.546 --> 17:01.838
Here, I got us
some coffee.

17:04.005 --> 17:05.505
Here.

17:11.130 --> 17:12.838
How'd you sleep?

17:12.838 --> 17:15.172
Um, not great.
You?

17:15.172 --> 17:17.297
Eh, I slept all right.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.130
Hey, I was thinking

17:19.130 --> 17:22.130
maybe instead of going to
the Arena Subdivision today,

17:22.130 --> 17:24.089
we go to a movie.

17:24.089 --> 17:28.380
I actually saw
this movie in the paper
called "Gangsta Love."

17:28.380 --> 17:31.922
I don't know.
I haven't really heard of it,
but sounds interesting.

17:36.380 --> 17:37.421
What? You okay?

17:37.421 --> 17:40.755
Uh, yeah,
just waking up.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.505
Coffee's good for that.

17:48.546 --> 17:50.546
Aren't you gonna drink
your coffee?

17:56.047 --> 17:58.588
We need to talk
about last night.

18:00.005 --> 18:02.421
Um, okay.

18:06.671 --> 18:08.214
( grunts )

18:10.630 --> 18:12.297
It was crazy.

18:12.297 --> 18:15.922
Yeah. I mean,
we could call it
a lot of things.

18:15.922 --> 18:19.505
We could call it, you know,
new and inspired
and eye-opening,

18:19.505 --> 18:21.797
but, yeah, in all fairness,
it was-- it was a bit crazy.

18:21.797 --> 18:25.463
Well, I guess
I'm starting to...

18:27.089 --> 18:29.421
Are you having
some doubts?

18:29.421 --> 18:32.255
- Well, yes.
- Okay.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.797
That is really a big thing
for you, isn't it?

18:37.130 --> 18:39.421
Okay, well,
let's get into it.

18:41.214 --> 18:43.339
- We drank beer, Elder.
- I know.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.421
- I was really drunk.
- Yeah, so was I.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.588
Okay, I think
if Heavenly Father
actually exists,

18:54.588 --> 18:57.297
then I think He was there
with us last night.

18:57.297 --> 19:01.214
I think He was guiding us
through this-- this change.

19:01.214 --> 19:04.671
And if that's true,
then maybe this change
wasn't so bad.

19:04.671 --> 19:07.130
- Elder--
- No, no, let me finish.

19:07.130 --> 19:10.671
My world has opened up
and I can't go back
to my old world.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.922
And if that's
what Heavenly Father
brought us last night,

19:12.922 --> 19:16.463
then I'd like
to try it again and more.

19:16.463 --> 19:21.005
I'd like to drink beer
and laugh and explore,

19:21.005 --> 19:23.130
you know, like normal
people our age do.

19:23.130 --> 19:25.963
- I just feel like--
- Are you saying you
wanna leave the church?

19:28.297 --> 19:29.797
I don't know.

19:31.339 --> 19:32.505
I don't know.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.838
But I do know that...

19:35.089 --> 19:37.339
I definitely
wanna go further

19:37.339 --> 19:39.339
before I even consider
going back.

19:48.713 --> 19:50.297
What are you doing?

19:50.297 --> 19:52.713
I'm pushing,
pushing further.

19:54.297 --> 19:56.797
Let's just try everything.
Let's just go for it.

19:56.797 --> 19:58.838
Elder, I'm not--

19:58.838 --> 20:00.671
You know, actually,
we don't know we are.

20:00.671 --> 20:02.797
Like, that's
the really great thing,
is we can just try stuff

20:02.797 --> 20:04.130
and kind of
figure it out.

20:05.214 --> 20:06.588
I'm really interested.

20:06.588 --> 20:08.421
- I can't--
- I'm really interested

20:08.421 --> 20:09.671
- and I know you are,
too, and...
- I can't.

20:09.671 --> 20:11.922
...and you're
my best friend.

20:11.922 --> 20:14.671
- I can't.
- Oh, but you
definitely can, Elder.

20:26.588 --> 20:28.005
Noah.

20:29.546 --> 20:31.797
- Just...
- Get away from me.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.880
Noah, it's okay.
( grunts )

20:37.546 --> 20:39.339
Elder?

20:43.214 --> 20:44.421
Elder!

20:44.421 --> 20:46.047
Elder, please wake up.

20:46.047 --> 20:47.421
Please wake up.

20:47.421 --> 20:49.588
Joseph.
Joseph.

20:49.588 --> 20:51.089
Joseph.
( slapping )

20:51.089 --> 20:53.047
Joseph, wake up.
Wake up!

20:53.047 --> 20:55.588
( panting )
Elder. Elder!

20:55.588 --> 20:57.421
Joseph!
Joseph.

21:00.255 --> 21:02.588
( panting )

21:04.297 --> 21:06.255
Joseph!
Joseph.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.421
This is supposed to work!

21:11.588 --> 21:13.588
( sobs )
Wake up.

21:19.755 --> 21:21.380
Please wake up.

21:51.463 --> 21:52.838
What is this?

21:57.546 --> 21:59.421
Was--
is this...

22:00.505 --> 22:02.297
the sign
we asked for?

22:04.214 --> 22:05.963
Or are we
being punished?

22:07.838 --> 22:11.297
I don't understand
any of this...

22:12.797 --> 22:13.963
anymore.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.838
I feel...

22:22.755 --> 22:24.630
that You have
forsaken me.

22:25.922 --> 22:28.339
- You have tempted--
- ( gasping )

22:34.380 --> 22:35.671
Oh.

22:35.671 --> 22:37.172
( groans )

22:47.130 --> 22:49.172
Did I just, uh...

22:49.172 --> 22:50.713
Uh-huh.

22:55.172 --> 22:57.797
And then
I just came back?

22:59.339 --> 23:00.880
Uh-huh.

23:08.630 --> 23:10.255
It's a sign.

23:12.755 --> 23:14.421
It's a miracle.

23:20.214 --> 23:21.588
Let's pray.

23:29.214 --> 23:31.047
- We should get going.
- Okay.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.505
- Wanna start with
the Arena Subdivision?
- Yes, sounds good.

23:39.047 --> 23:40.755
48 more days to go.

23:40.755 --> 23:42.546
We'll get one, Elder.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.755
I know we will, Elder.

24:05.755 --> 24:07.089
Elder?

24:11.922 --> 24:13.713
You thinking about...?

24:13.713 --> 24:14.755
Yes.
