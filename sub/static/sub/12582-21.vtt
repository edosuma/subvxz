00:33.450 --> 00:36.977
I detect activity at the place
Luanne used to rent

00:37.020 --> 00:40.421
before she re-barnacled herself
to Hank's house.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.425
She sure is wearing
a lot of jewelry

00:42.459 --> 00:43.858
for the middle of the day.

00:43.893 --> 00:45.258
Hello, gentlemen.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.230
I'm Abbie Holiday,
with Holiday and Sands Realty.

00:48.264 --> 00:50.630
You are so lucky
to be living here.

00:50.667 --> 00:53.727
This whole neighborhood
is red-hot.

00:53.770 --> 00:55.738
You've got great curb appeal...

00:55.772 --> 00:57.296
especially that gem.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.808
Who lives in that charmer?

00:59.843 --> 01:01.902
I do.

01:01.945 --> 01:05.403
Well, if y'all decide
to sell, call me.

01:05.447 --> 01:08.849
Rainey Street is hot.

01:10.353 --> 01:12.321
Ah, here she is now,

01:12.355 --> 01:16.587
our Rice University
summer school superstar.

01:16.626 --> 01:18.753
Dad, I haven't made it
into the program yet.

01:18.795 --> 01:20.057
I just had the interview.

01:20.096 --> 01:21.461
Of course, you're in.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.126
You have perfect grades,
all the right extracurriculars,

01:24.167 --> 01:26.601
and you've wasted countless
hours volunteering.

01:26.636 --> 01:29.298
Here, put this on.

01:29.339 --> 01:33.275
16% cotton for 100% genius.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.144
Did we hear from summer school

01:36.179 --> 01:37.237
today? Huh?

01:40.316 --> 01:41.283
"Regret"...

01:41.317 --> 01:42.284
"not"...

01:42.318 --> 01:43.512
"unfortunately."

01:45.054 --> 01:46.385
It's all right, Dad.

01:46.422 --> 01:48.788
This summer, I'll
just study for fun.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.320
<i>You say no. I say yes!</i>

01:52.362 --> 01:54.489
There were many
highly qualified applicants

01:54.531 --> 01:55.589
and unfortunately...

01:55.632 --> 01:57.327
Connie has best
grades in school.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.426
Yes, but it's not
just about grades.

01:59.469 --> 02:00.595
I know that

02:00.637 --> 02:02.366
Connie also have
more extracurriculars

02:02.405 --> 02:03.497
than anyone else.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.667
Look, Connie's
a really smart Asian girl,

02:05.708 --> 02:07.505
but I've got
a boatload of them,

02:07.544 --> 02:08.943
pardon the expression.

02:08.978 --> 02:10.172
She's not black.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.704
She's not Hispanic
or even white.

02:12.749 --> 02:15.741
I mean, good Lord, give me a
white kid from a public school

02:15.785 --> 02:18.549
with Connie's specs, and that
kid could waltz in here.

02:18.588 --> 02:20.419
You telling me
Connie didn't get in

02:20.456 --> 02:22.424
because she's
an overachieving Asian?

02:23.927 --> 02:25.394
That's discrimination!

02:25.428 --> 02:27.521
In a way, it's
flattering, isn't it?

02:28.765 --> 02:30.255
Hey, maybe there's something

02:30.300 --> 02:32.666
that you left off
of Connie's application.

02:32.702 --> 02:34.533
You know, some kind of "hook."

02:34.571 --> 02:36.801
Has Connie ever had
to play that violin of hers

02:36.840 --> 02:38.068
on the street, you know,

02:38.107 --> 02:40.371
to buy her strung-out
mother just one more hit?

02:40.410 --> 02:42.378
No.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.607
Well, that could have helped.

02:46.049 --> 02:47.516
Ted!

02:47.550 --> 02:49.677
I looked for you
at the Buddhist temple.

02:49.719 --> 02:50.777
Oh, hello, Kahn.

02:50.820 --> 02:52.151
We're Episcopal now.

02:52.188 --> 02:53.746
It's just good business.

02:53.790 --> 02:55.052
Oh, there's the mayor.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.649
Your boy must be very upset

02:56.693 --> 02:58.718
about Rice
summer school rejection.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.160
What are you talking about?

03:00.196 --> 03:01.561
Chane got in, and he's got

03:01.598 --> 03:04.066
a super-low lottery number
for the best dorm.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.362
Air conditioned.

03:05.401 --> 03:06.595
How can this be?

03:06.636 --> 03:09.002
Chane is just as
Asian as Connie

03:09.038 --> 03:12.030
and, no offense, he's,
well, you know...

03:15.645 --> 03:17.704
Accepted.

03:17.747 --> 03:20.215
Look, if you want Connie
to get into Rice,

03:20.250 --> 03:22.241
just give them
a $10,000 donation.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.445
Call my office.

03:23.486 --> 03:25.920
Trudy will give you
the contact information.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.253
Oh, Councilman Ebberd!

03:31.661 --> 03:33.390
Crunch numbers harder.

03:33.429 --> 03:34.396
It's no use.

03:34.430 --> 03:35.829
We don't have $10,000

03:35.865 --> 03:38.231
to buy our way
out of being Asian.

03:38.268 --> 03:40.634
I should be more
like Ted Wassanasong!

03:40.670 --> 03:41.967
Own my own business.

03:42.005 --> 03:44.269
But I am just
a middle-management ox

03:44.307 --> 03:47.435
plodding in the poop
of the beast in front of me,

03:47.477 --> 03:49.468
and no matter how hard I work

03:49.512 --> 03:51.377
or how hard Connie studies,

03:51.414 --> 03:53.075
we all just stuck here.

03:53.116 --> 03:54.515
We the kind of losers

03:54.550 --> 03:57.383
politicians pander
to in speeches.

04:05.595 --> 04:06.687
It's so exciting

04:06.729 --> 04:09.357
living in an up-and-
coming neighborhood.

04:09.399 --> 04:11.697
I wonder where they'll
put the Starbucks.

04:11.734 --> 04:13.326
So now that our neighborhood

04:13.369 --> 04:14.700
has been declared hot,

04:14.737 --> 04:18.103
what street should we
look down on? Bagley?

04:18.141 --> 04:19.574
No, Apple Blossom.

04:19.608 --> 04:22.908
Apple Blossom is crap.

04:22.946 --> 04:24.504
Yup.

04:24.547 --> 04:26.447
If you like traffic, enjoy.

04:26.482 --> 04:27.449
We got plenty of it.

04:30.420 --> 04:32.388
Hello? Oh, yes, sir.

04:32.422 --> 04:36.051
No, I filed my TPS report
yesterday.

04:36.092 --> 04:38.390
Yes, sir, I be there right away.

04:48.104 --> 04:50.265
Looks like you could
use a new mirror.

04:50.306 --> 04:52.501
I got a buddy who could
hook you up if you want.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.739
No, I member of Silver Star
Service team at dealer.

04:55.778 --> 04:59.270
VIP shuttle, free <i>Wall Street</i>
<i>Journal</i>. Thanks anyway.

04:59.315 --> 05:02.944
Well, if you want to be a Silver
Star chump, suit yourself.

05:02.986 --> 05:05.580
That free newspaper's
gonna cost you 700 bucks

05:05.621 --> 05:08.055
by the time the dealer
marks up the mirror.

05:09.092 --> 05:10.525
Okay, thanks for everything,

05:10.560 --> 05:11.959
but I gotta take this call.

05:11.995 --> 05:15.362
Sounds like them "gottas"
got you by the shorties.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.026
Hello? Oh, naw, just
a little car trouble.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.865
I'm just running
a little late, but to be fair,

05:20.903 --> 05:22.564
you know, I have been early

05:22.605 --> 05:25.130
for the last 548
business days in a row...

05:25.174 --> 05:27.438
Dock my pay. Yes, sir.

05:27.477 --> 05:28.705
Very good.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.076
Dang, man, I been in jails

05:30.113 --> 05:32.172
that gave me more
freedom than you got.

05:32.215 --> 05:33.580
Yeah, but what you gonna do?

05:33.616 --> 05:36.710
Whatever I damn want,
whenever I damn want,

05:36.753 --> 05:38.846
with whoever I damn want.

05:38.888 --> 05:40.856
Boy, you say "damn" a lot.

05:40.890 --> 05:42.152
Hell, yeah.

05:42.191 --> 05:44.716
Listen, friend, I used
to be just like you.

05:44.761 --> 05:45.728
I was the monkey

05:45.762 --> 05:47.730
in that cage right there,

05:47.764 --> 05:49.925
Now, I don't take
no mess from nobody

05:49.966 --> 05:51.228
'cause I'm a man.

05:51.267 --> 05:54.236
My own man. Elvin Mackleston.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.008
Take a good look
at yourself, friend.

06:01.044 --> 06:03.012
Are you rocking
in the free world?

06:03.046 --> 06:04.206
Are you?

06:12.789 --> 06:13.881
Go to hell!

06:13.923 --> 06:15.413
Let's get you that new mirror.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.892
Damn straight.

06:29.739 --> 06:32.367
Uh, if you're looking
for the package store,

06:32.408 --> 06:35.206
it's down Garland Road
past the spillway.

06:35.244 --> 06:36.973
Whoo-whee!

06:37.013 --> 06:40.312
Kahn, what are you doing
in an El Camino?

06:40.349 --> 06:42.078
Test driving this baby.

06:42.118 --> 06:44.279
That one sweet ride,
I tell you what.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.051
Not often your new mirror can be
attached to a damn El Camino.

06:48.091 --> 06:50.025
Damn straight.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.818
Hey, what do you say?

06:53.863 --> 06:55.558
I want it bad.

06:55.598 --> 06:58.226
Well, all right. Dobber!

06:58.267 --> 06:59.734
You got a primo

06:59.769 --> 07:03.170
El Camino and cash money
for your old car.

07:03.206 --> 07:05.140
This is your damn lucky day.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.506
After Dobber and me
break your rig down for parts,

07:07.543 --> 07:09.408
we're going to do
a little celebratin'...

07:09.445 --> 07:11.606
on you, money bags.

07:14.650 --> 07:16.345
I know what you're thinking.

07:16.385 --> 07:19.183
Why not an IROC?
Why not a "Z" car?

07:19.222 --> 07:21.019
But like Elvin points out,

07:21.057 --> 07:22.024
those are just cars.

07:22.058 --> 07:25.687
A Camino... is a way of life.

07:25.728 --> 07:28.959
It'll haul anything:
Rebar, copper pipe.

07:28.998 --> 07:32.024
Hell, you hit a deer, he'll
just flip over into the back.

07:32.068 --> 07:33.535
You don't even need to stop.

07:33.569 --> 07:35.434
I had you rednecks all wrong.

07:36.839 --> 07:38.363
I'm going hang
out in the alley

07:38.407 --> 07:40.705
and spend my welfare checks on
beer like you guys,

07:40.743 --> 07:43.974
be my own man.

07:44.013 --> 07:44.980
Kahn!

07:45.014 --> 07:47.881
Minh doesn't know the drill yet.

07:50.019 --> 07:51.816
Huh.

07:51.854 --> 07:53.617
<i>You want to be a redneck?</i>

07:53.656 --> 07:56.056
That's not even possible.

07:56.092 --> 07:58.560
Kahn, I upset
about Connie, too,

07:58.594 --> 08:00.562
but you have
to snap out of it.

08:00.596 --> 08:02.325
Your boss calls
three times today.

08:02.365 --> 08:03.832
You gonna get fired.

08:03.866 --> 08:06.699
I got a new boss,
and I love him: Me!

08:07.870 --> 08:09.667
Minh, don't you see?

08:09.705 --> 08:11.673
There's a paradise out there

08:11.707 --> 08:15.006
where nobody works,
nobody cares,

08:15.044 --> 08:18.571
nobody have plans or dreams
that can be crushed.

08:18.614 --> 08:21.344
Oh, I don't know, Kahn.

08:21.384 --> 08:23.352
Sounds crazy.

08:23.386 --> 08:26.878
Come on, Minh,
let's just give up.

08:27.957 --> 08:29.925
Hmm.

08:29.959 --> 08:32.359
I'd never have to read
another Toni Morrison book

08:32.395 --> 08:33.861
for book club, or...

08:33.895 --> 08:36.558
or write another check to NPR!

08:36.599 --> 08:37.566
Oh...

08:37.600 --> 08:39.033
but what about Connie?

08:39.068 --> 08:41.832
Don't you see?
This is for Connie,

08:41.871 --> 08:46.035
so she don't waste half her life
losing at their rigged game.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.369
What do you say, Minh?

08:49.412 --> 08:53.041
Will you be my redneck bride?

08:54.617 --> 08:58.053
Oh, yes, Kahn, I will.

08:58.087 --> 09:02.319

He's been pushing Connie

10:02.585 --> 10:04.712
all these years,
and he's the one that broke.

10:04.754 --> 10:07.382
Let that be a lesson
to you, Dad.

10:07.423 --> 10:09.220
Yep, he is really losing it.

10:09.258 --> 10:12.557
I saw him this morning,
and he's growing a wispy mustache.

10:12.595 --> 10:14.563
He's got the coolest
car-truck,

10:14.597 --> 10:17.225
and he's got a laundry machine
in his yard

10:17.266 --> 10:19.461
for stray dogs
to have puppies in.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.569
It's the weekend.
Time to party.

10:26.609 --> 10:29.737
Elvin and the gang are going
cat fisting down at the lake.

10:29.779 --> 10:32.839
Come on with your Daddy
and have some fun.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.749
Uh, it's only Wednesday,
and I've got to study.

10:35.785 --> 10:37.719
Did you say cat fisting?

10:37.753 --> 10:39.220
Most definitely.

10:39.255 --> 10:40.916
The first step in cat fisting

10:40.956 --> 10:44.824
is to reach in and
get you a big handful of stink-bait.

10:44.860 --> 10:47.658
P.U. What's in this stink-bait?

10:47.697 --> 10:49.324
Well, you got your ground liver,

10:49.365 --> 10:50.832
blood, vinegar,

10:50.866 --> 10:54.666
Alpo and my secret ingredient
that makes it stink.

10:54.704 --> 10:56.672
When you feel their whiskers
on your knuckles,

Hey, baby, look what I got
for you!

11:02.311 --> 11:03.869
That's great, honey.

11:05.414 --> 11:08.144
Look at that son of a bitch
wriggle!

11:12.254 --> 11:14.882
And then my parents made me
quit practicing my concerto

11:14.924 --> 11:17.222
to play "The Devil Went
Down to Georgia."

11:17.259 --> 11:19.887
Sounds to me like
you're living the life:

11:19.929 --> 11:23.729
Fried food, no studying,
the TV's always on...

11:25.801 --> 11:29.066
It's horrible, but hopefully,
it'll be over soon.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.266
My dad said he was going to go
to the office today.

11:31.307 --> 11:32.899
Connie!

11:32.942 --> 11:36.742
Look at this mother file cabinet
they throwing out at the office!

11:37.813 --> 11:40.680
Your dad is white trash.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.248
What are you doing?!

11:43.285 --> 11:46.254
Knocking $15,000
off the sale price.

11:46.288 --> 11:49.086
I can't move this house
with that pigsty next door.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.920

but enough is enough.

12:04.273 --> 12:05.865
This has got to stop, Hank.

12:05.908 --> 12:08.536
Abbie Holiday said
that Kahn is turning Rainey Street

12:08.577 --> 12:11.410
into another Belcher's Grove.

12:11.447 --> 12:14.211
I didn't keep
novelty mailboxes

trying to steal your valuables.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.627
I was not.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.569
Hank, you want a

12:35.604 --> 12:37.071

12:37.106 --> 12:38.903
Kahn, I'm worried
about you and...

12:38.941 --> 12:41.239

12:58.694 --> 12:59.786
let's get out of here.

12:59.829 --> 13:01.592
I got a case of beer
that needs drinkin'.

Mud Dobber just put a new Adelbrock
manifold on his Malibu.

13:10.673 --> 13:12.197
Connie, last chance

13:12.241 --> 13:14.209
to change your mind
and come with.

13:14.243 --> 13:16.507
You don't want to miss
that new Adelbrock.

13:16.545 --> 13:17.876
It's loud!

13:17.913 --> 13:19.210
Uh, that's okay.

13:19.248 --> 13:21.113
I'm just going to stay home.

at home by yourself.

13:23.519 --> 13:26.852
You stay with the Hills.

13:26.889 --> 13:30.723
Well, then, we'll just have us
a nice sleepover, shall we?

13:30.759 --> 13:33.057
Connie, do you have some pajamas
you can wear?

13:33.095 --> 13:34.221
Yes, Mrs. Hill.

13:34.263 --> 13:36.891
Bobby, why don't you go
with Connie?

13:36.932 --> 13:38.559
Oh, that poor girl.

13:38.601 --> 13:39.898
Ah, don't worry.

13:39.935 --> 13:42.233
Kahn and Minh'll sober up
and snap out of it.

13:42.271 --> 13:45.069
They're too arrogant
to live this way for long.

13:45.107 --> 13:47.132
I hope you're right, Hank.

13:49.345 --> 13:50.573
Mr. And Mrs. Hill,

13:50.613 --> 13:53.548
I think there may be a solution
to our problem.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.106
See, Peggy, what'd I tell you?

13:55.150 --> 13:57.243
I just heard
from Southwest Mortgage.

13:57.286 --> 13:59.254
They're starting
foreclosure proceedings

13:59.288 --> 14:01.688
on the Souphanousinphones.

14:01.724 --> 14:03.191
They've only missed
one payment,

14:03.225 --> 14:06.524
but since they let their house
go to... uh, this,

14:06.562 --> 14:08.996
the bank's not going
to cut them any slack.

14:09.031 --> 14:12.159
You mean Kahn and
Minh are going to lose their home?

14:12.201 --> 14:16.661
With any luck, they'll be
out of here in ten working days.

14:17.740 --> 14:19.708
I got my pajamas.

14:29.151 --> 14:30.880
I'd like to whop
that neighbor of yours

14:30.920 --> 14:33.855
upside the head
and feed bad meat to his dog.

14:33.889 --> 14:35.481
You ought to get yourself
a place here

14:35.524 --> 14:37.924
in Belcher's Grove
where decent people live.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.053
Hmm, I'm going to think
real hard on that.

14:41.263 --> 14:43.231
Come with me, honey.

14:43.265 --> 14:45.062
Elvin caught a mess
of squirrels today.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.694
I'll show you how
to de-bone 'em.

14:47.736 --> 14:49.670
Squirrels?

14:54.810 --> 14:57.370
Yeah, Lucky...
why they call you Lucky?

14:57.413 --> 14:59.745
True story.
I was at Costco one day,

14:59.782 --> 15:01.511
and all of the sudden,
the nature called.

15:01.550 --> 15:02.847
Yelled is more like it.

15:02.885 --> 15:04.682
So I high-tail it
into the john,

15:04.720 --> 15:06.210
and there's
some "sensitive" guy

15:06.255 --> 15:07.688
changing his little
boy's diapers

15:07.723 --> 15:09.384
on one of them baby
ironing boards.

15:09.425 --> 15:11.188
And don't you know
I slipped on pee pee

15:11.226 --> 15:13.854
and broke two vertebrae
which had to be fused together.

15:13.896 --> 15:15.864
I'm in constant pain,
but by God,

15:15.898 --> 15:18.662
I got me a $53,000 settlement.

15:18.701 --> 15:20.862
This son of a bitch
is never going to have to work

15:20.903 --> 15:22.200
another day in his life.

15:22.237 --> 15:24.228
That's why they call me Lucky.

15:24.306 --> 15:25.864
That's why they
That's a great story. Ucky.

15:25.908 --> 15:28.570

15:32.881 --> 15:34.542

what's going to open it.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.016

15:36.051 --> 15:38.281

Yee-haw!

15:41.190 --> 15:42.157

15:44.493 --> 15:46.893

Kahn, put that rock down!

15:49.131 --> 15:51.361
It's Trace Adkin's new CD,
woman.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.890
I ate a squirrel quesadilla,

15:52.935 --> 15:54.732
but this is where
I draw the line.

15:54.770 --> 15:57.568
Rock go through window,
I go home.

15:58.641 --> 16:01.235
Aw, hell, this is ridiculous.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.840
I warned you, Kahn.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.748
I'm not going to watch you
go to jail.

stand by you tonight.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.201

damn fool out of you.

17:10.045 --> 17:11.672
I'll go over and talk to her.

to foreclose on you.

Oh, my God.

17:30.733 --> 17:33.361
I... I don't know
what happened.

17:33.402 --> 17:36.701
We were having so much fun
being free and irresponsible,

17:36.739 --> 17:40.573
I-I guess we just forgot
where our mortgage coupon was.

17:42.578 --> 17:44.205
And our electric bill.

Her parents drunk.

17:49.251 --> 17:50.878
We nearly homeless.

17:50.919 --> 17:52.978
Her father abandon her.

17:53.021 --> 17:55.046
I'm not going to let
Connie be homeless.

17:55.090 --> 17:56.648
I'm going to find Kahn.

17:56.692 --> 18:00.128
Now, you start paying
some bills.

18:01.530 --> 18:03.157

of yours.

18:09.471 --> 18:10.597
Kahn?

18:10.639 --> 18:12.664
Aw, yeah, yeah,
he looks like he's got

18:12.708 --> 18:16.644
real crafty Ninja moves, but can
he take a board to the head?

18:16.678 --> 18:17.667
Where are you, sir?!

18:17.713 --> 18:18.680
At the stick fights

18:18.714 --> 18:20.011
down behind the lumberyard.

18:20.048 --> 18:22.175
Kahn's on the card,
three fights from now.

18:22.217 --> 18:25.311
He's up against
a soft-spoken gorilla man.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.844
Good lord!

18:33.162 --> 18:35.528
Yeah! Hit him with
a damn stick!

18:47.709 --> 18:49.870
Winner. Next.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.410
Oh, no!

18:56.451 --> 19:00.251
All money down,
and commence fightin'.

19:00.289 --> 19:02.587
Wait!

You come to get your
whoopin', Hank Hill?

19:07.095 --> 19:09.154
I came to talk some sense
into you, Kahn.

19:09.198 --> 19:11.826
Uh-uh, beat some
sense into him, Hank!

19:11.867 --> 19:13.334
I bet on the simpleton.

19:15.504 --> 19:16.664
You're about to throw away

19:16.705 --> 19:18.673
everything
you ever worked for, Kahn.

19:18.707 --> 19:21.676
You're about to lose
your dang house.

19:21.710 --> 19:24.679
Everything already been
taken away.

19:27.516 --> 19:29.381
Hit him, four eyes!

19:29.418 --> 19:31.852
They're talking about you.

19:33.055 --> 19:35.148
Come on, swing. Take me out.

19:35.190 --> 19:36.851
Stop feeling sorry
for yourself

19:36.892 --> 19:38.689
and start thinking
about Connie.

19:38.727 --> 19:41.696
You want her growing up
in the back of an El Camino?

19:41.730 --> 19:43.197
Well, what choice do I have?

19:43.232 --> 19:46.531
We flee horrible dictatorships,
learn a new language

19:46.568 --> 19:48.365
and then work hard
and study hard.

19:48.403 --> 19:50.530
And our reward
for doing everything right

19:50.572 --> 19:52.540
is to be told, "Go to hell!

19:52.574 --> 19:56.169
You work too hard.
You study too hard."

19:56.211 --> 19:59.044
Yeah, you got a real bum deal,

19:59.081 --> 20:01.049
but maybe you could take
a lesson from Connie

20:01.083 --> 20:02.607
instead of these apes.

20:02.651 --> 20:04.710
Even when you and Minh went
off the deep end,

20:04.753 --> 20:08.120
Connie never complained
and she never stopped trying.

20:08.156 --> 20:09.555
You couldn't drag
that little girl

20:09.591 --> 20:13.049
down into the muck with you.

20:13.095 --> 20:15.063
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

20:15.097 --> 20:18.555
Connie like a beautiful lotus
growing out of the muck.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.363
That's her hook!

20:20.402 --> 20:22.700
Well, I'm glad
I got through to you.

20:24.239 --> 20:25.206
You wuss!

20:25.240 --> 20:27.401
Shut up and run, Hank!

20:27.442 --> 20:30.900
I got to get my daughter
into summer school.

20:30.946 --> 20:32.243
I don't care who.

20:32.281 --> 20:34.374
Somebody's gettin' hit
with a stick.

20:40.923 --> 20:42.413
Young lady, you should know

20:42.457 --> 20:45.119
Stanford's summer school admissions
deadline has passed.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.253
I'm sorry my application
was tardy.

20:47.296 --> 20:49.264
It's been a hectic time for me.

20:49.298 --> 20:50.595
My parents don't work.

20:50.632 --> 20:52.429
We nearly lost our home.

20:52.467 --> 20:54.264
My Dad abandoned us for awhile,

20:54.303 --> 20:56.567
and he was nearly killed
with a 2x4.

20:56.605 --> 20:58.539
That's him.

21:00.275 --> 21:01.435
Hmm.

21:01.476 --> 21:04.536
You've overcome so much.
