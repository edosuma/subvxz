WEBVTT

00:07.049 --> 00:09.166
Did they go down to Arctic Avenue?

00:09.343 --> 00:12.131
Yeah. If you hit Arctic, you went too far.

00:12.304 --> 00:15.297
Turn back.
You're gonna hang a left on Ashley.

00:15.474 --> 00:16.806
I'll see you in a bit.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.979
All right, Brax, bring it on!

00:27.986 --> 00:29.693
There you go.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.031
Mom.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.836
- Mom!
- Michael.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.964
- Come on.
- Brax, Poppy, go to your mother!

00:51.093 --> 00:53.710
Come on, Brax, let's go. Go, go, go.

01:13.365 --> 01:15.652
If you answer, we're getting a divorce.

01:15.826 --> 01:18.318
- I have to meet Reddington in 30.
- No.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.657
Tell him that your second husband...

01:20.831 --> 01:24.495
- ...insists you take one day off.
- You're my first husband.

01:24.668 --> 01:27.001
Our first marriage was annulled.
And last night...

01:27.170 --> 01:30.959
...was our first time sleeping together
as husband and wife.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.633
Well, actually, like, the third time.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.213
Well, first night.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.878
And morning.

01:41.351 --> 01:44.264
- Guy really is a problem.
- That's your phone.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.179
"No Caller ID"?

01:46.356 --> 01:49.394
- It's very mysterious.
- I wanna keep it that way.

01:49.568 --> 01:52.481
Could've won a set
of steak knives or the lottery.

01:52.654 --> 01:56.068
Know what? I won the lottery
when you agreed to marry me...

01:56.241 --> 01:58.483
- ...again.
- And I have steak knives.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.698
- So we're good.
- It's fine. Don't need to answer.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.501
- You okay?
- Better than okay.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.838
I'm great. We're great, Tom and I.
We got married.

02:16.595 --> 02:17.756
See?

02:19.431 --> 02:22.720
Now's normally when people say,
"Congratulations."

02:22.893 --> 02:26.102
I'm sorry. Tom and I have had
our differences...

02:26.271 --> 02:30.265
...but I believe he wants
what's best for you and Agnes.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.980
Congratulations, Elizabeth.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.564
Thank you.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.315
You know, for the first time
in a very long time...

02:38.492 --> 02:42.782
...I feel, you know, happy.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.999
Then I see what's going on in the world.

02:53.715 --> 02:58.835
Migrants hidden away in a Chinese
freighter bound for South Carolina.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.469
Human trafficking.

03:01.473 --> 03:05.558
Trafficking implies the passengers
are being moved against their will.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.640
These people paid for the privilege.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.397
All over, criminals are smuggling people...

03:11.566 --> 03:13.808
...into countries they can't enter legally.

03:13.985 --> 03:18.355
Some are hoping for a better life,
others are escaping war persecution.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.149
For a price,
people like me can help them.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.612
Like you?

03:22.786 --> 03:24.948
You're in the human-smuggling business?

03:25.122 --> 03:26.704
I was.

03:27.374 --> 03:31.664
My organization provided access
to the Americas...

03:31.837 --> 03:35.922
...various European countries,
select destinations in Asia.

03:36.091 --> 03:40.210
For a fair price,
I provided a quality service.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.262
Mr. Kaplan put an end to that.

03:43.432 --> 03:46.516
In her feverish desire to destroy me...

03:46.685 --> 03:49.393
...Kate destroyed my relocation networks.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.897
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because, as you can see...

03:53.066 --> 03:56.559
...a ruthless and unscrupulous player
has stepped forward...

03:56.737 --> 03:58.603
...to fill the void left by my absence.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.069
<i>The ship these people
were packed into like sardines...</i>

04:02.242 --> 04:05.076
<i>...was a death trap that wasn't fit
to make the journey.</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:08.363
<i>Which is why it sank
two miles off the Carolina coast.</i>

04:08.540 --> 04:10.247
Mr. Zhang...

04:10.417 --> 04:11.703
...I'm a simple man.

04:11.877 --> 04:15.917
When I hire a mechanic,
I expect him to know how to fix my car.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.502
When I hire a Snakehead,
I expect him to know...

04:18.675 --> 04:21.166
...how to ship our clients
without killing them.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.961
It was a mistake.

04:24.973 --> 04:28.933
- Please.
- Twenty-nine clients died.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.095
Clients who were to pay
a balance upon arrival.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.480
That's not gonna happen
now that they're dead.

04:34.941 --> 04:38.059
We did what you said.
We put as many people on the...

04:40.697 --> 04:43.531
Sorry, Da.
Wish you didn't have to see that.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.817
Dead clients don't make us money...

04:45.994 --> 04:48.577
...but neither do dead employees.

04:48.747 --> 04:53.458
Elizabeth, whomever has filled
the vacuum left by my downfall...

04:53.627 --> 04:55.243
...has to be stopped.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.663
Or more innocent people will die.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.253
So Reddington moved people illegally
across borders.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.884
- Right?
- In his mind, he gave people hope.

05:04.054 --> 05:07.513
Some are alive because he got them away
from what they were running from.

05:07.682 --> 05:12.097
Don't assume they were good. Most,
perhaps, but border control is essential.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.478
Whatever you believe, bottom line...

05:14.648 --> 05:16.685
...people are dying,
and that needs to stop.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.645
The player who took Red's routes...

05:18.819 --> 05:21.482
- ...he doesn't know who?
- Which is why he needs our help.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.693
Sounds like what you want
is help getting rid of the competition.

05:24.866 --> 05:29.156
There are much easier ways
to earn a dollar than moving migrants.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.697
I did it because someone will.
If it's going to be done...

05:32.874 --> 05:36.868
...it should be done well by someone
who holds to certain standards.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.211
Very noble.

05:39.548 --> 05:42.336
A man in your position can act
on his conscience.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.085
I'm the assistant director of the FBI.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.504
I'll help you take down
whoever took your place.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.424
But the bureau can't be responsible
for putting you back...

05:50.600 --> 05:52.762
...in the global smuggling business.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.552
- Fair enough.
- Good.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.812
- Then where do we start?
- Greece.

05:56.982 --> 06:01.022
The route through Macedonia.
It's the most traveled and lucrative.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.811
It's a simple plan.
We put someone in the pipeline...

06:03.989 --> 06:07.482
...he gets the name of the person
who took over my routes, we pull him out.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.571
You know the access point they're using?

06:09.744 --> 06:13.363
I do. Normally I'd suggest
we insert one of your people...

06:13.540 --> 06:15.827
...to get the name, but this time...

06:16.001 --> 06:18.744
...I suggest we use one of mine.

06:19.421 --> 06:23.381
We'll stay in touch via this device
I can embed in your rear molar.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.963
Works like a microphone,
lets me pick up your voice.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.503
And I can hear you
because the same transmitter...

06:28.680 --> 06:33.300
...allows the sound of your voice
to travel up the jawbone and into my ear.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.889
Yeah, that's... That's right.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.395
- How'd you know that?
- Khan Academy.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.773
I took their course
in electrical engineering.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.810
- Don't you also speak five languages?
- Eight.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.447
Other than the fact you sometimes have
to kill people for a living...

06:48.909 --> 06:50.821
...you're, like, my role model.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.451
Open up.

07:10.347 --> 07:14.182
- He's in. Aram, you have ears?
- I do. We are up and live.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.389
Heads up. We have no idea
what we're walking into here.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.020
Aside from the fact we have
no authority in Greece...

07:20.190 --> 07:23.934
- ...and sending a civilian in undercover.
- He's gonna crush it.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.477
Welcome, friend.
Help you find something?

07:27.072 --> 07:31.737
I was told you have a copy
of Eratosthenes' map of the world.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.243
It's not for sale.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.243
I was also told...

07:38.750 --> 07:40.241
...everything's for sale.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.495
<i>You'll have to ask the boss.</i>

08:12.033 --> 08:13.149
Let me look at you.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.910
- What's your name?
- Malik Charef.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.406
- Where you from, Malik Charef?
- Oran.

08:20.583 --> 08:24.918
I see. And how does an Algerian
find himself so far from home?

08:25.088 --> 08:28.877
I traveled to ZÄwiyah. Bought passage
across the water to LĂŠsbos.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.005
Now I'm seeking safe transport to Berlin.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.046
Search him.

08:36.057 --> 08:39.015
- He's checking for a wire.
- Who are you?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.888
The police?

08:41.062 --> 08:42.428
<i>The Astynomia?</i>

08:45.025 --> 08:46.891
Open your mouth.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.775
Open.

08:49.988 --> 08:53.652
- Sir, what do you want us to do?
- Hold. Let it play out.

08:54.367 --> 08:58.077
You're not from Oran.
You've had dental work done in the West.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.703
Maybe I should kill you.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.240
Who are you?

09:02.417 --> 09:04.204
Count down from five.

09:04.377 --> 09:08.872
If I'm with the police, they're listening.
They won't let you get to zero.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.793
They'll storm this place,
then you won't have to guess who I am.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.052
You think this is a game?

09:16.222 --> 09:18.384
Let's play your game.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.508
- Five...
- They're gonna shoot him.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.552
- We gotta move.
- Hold your position.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.097
Three, two...

09:27.901 --> 09:29.312
...one.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.818
Be here tomorrow, 10:00.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.328
I'll have you in Germany
by the end of the week.

09:41.706 --> 09:45.290
The cost is 3000 euro,
and payment is due up front.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.624
<i>The Irish are no longer accepting funds
upon arrival.</i>

09:52.133 --> 09:55.376
The Irish. The coyote Dembe met
mentioned something about the Irish.

09:55.553 --> 09:59.638
- Know who he's talking about?
- Yes. The Irishman, Arthur Kilgannon.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.391
I've never met him, he lives in Sofia.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.973
That's not a city I frequent.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.160
Hello, old man.

10:21.788 --> 10:26.579
Is the sun past the yardarm?
Perhaps I'll have a drink too.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.460
- Hey.
- Wasn't sure you'd come.

10:37.637 --> 10:41.005
Sorry, I couldn't take your calls,
my wife and I were...

10:41.182 --> 10:42.548
...occupied. What do you got?

10:42.725 --> 10:46.093
You were right. Pete used my info
to take out a credit card in my name.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.979
- He used it here?
- Fraud unit asked if I could confirm...

10:49.149 --> 10:52.187
...using one of my cards here
yesterday at 6:43 p.m.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.319
- So he was here.
- Come with me.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.113
Excuse me.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.707
- Can I help you?
- Sweetie...

11:08.877 --> 11:10.834
...you have somewhere
I could try this on?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.336
No, sorry. I don't.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.464
Figured as much.
Mind holding my purse?

11:36.654 --> 11:40.989
- What do you think? Too tight?
- No. No, it looks good.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.321
Hey! You can't be in here.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.205
Did you hear what I said?

11:51.753 --> 11:56.544
- That one, definitely. Time to go.
- Thanks again. You're a lifesaver.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.597
Your reputation precedes you.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.062
Well, unfortunately for you...

12:16.236 --> 12:17.693
...so does yours.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.358
- You've had a setback.
- Yes.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.272
Of which you've taken full advantage.

12:22.450 --> 12:26.410
Well, I doubt you came all this way
just to compliment my efforts.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.237
I have a proposition.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.031
Then you've come
to the wrong Kilgannon.

12:31.209 --> 12:35.328
My son handles all the day-to-day.
He rebuilt your smuggling network...

12:35.505 --> 12:37.713
...in next to no time.

12:38.341 --> 12:41.834
It's easy to move quickly
when you don't care about quality control.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.173
The ship from China...

12:44.722 --> 12:49.092
- ...Colin said that's an isolated incident.
- My sources say otherwise.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.603
The way I hear it, travelers are dying
all over the place.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.732
In six months, the business you took
from me won't exist.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.644
My proposition is a fifty-fifty split.

12:59.821 --> 13:03.064
Colin cedes operational control to me...

13:03.241 --> 13:06.109
...mortality rates plummet, profits soar.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.620
My son knows what he's doing.

13:16.796 --> 13:21.962
The reputation that precedes you is one
of a man with exacting standards.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.173
I'm sorry to see that's not the case.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.686
- He's hurt.
- It's not easy killing a man.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.644
- I'm sure Nik put up a fight.
- You don't know he killed him.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.060
He changed his appearance,
so he's hiding something.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.689
That one. There. That's his car.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.112
Hello.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.152
What is that? A key?

13:50.913 --> 13:52.654
Red Birch Motel.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.085
Meet Arthur and Colin Kilgannon.
On paper, they're shipping consultants.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.247
In reality, they smuggle illegal objects
and substances...

14:01.424 --> 14:03.211
<i>- ...around the globe.</i>
- Including people.

14:03.384 --> 14:07.128
They operate in Bulgaria, protected
by the older Kilgannon's connections.

14:07.305 --> 14:10.139
Local authorities won't cooperate
on warrants or subpoenas.

14:10.308 --> 14:13.426
It'll make it impossible
to track their operation.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.601
Not if we have someone
on the inside to document it for us.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.733
- Absolutely not.
- I've been approved for transport.

14:20.902 --> 14:24.145
You went in to get a name.
Mission accomplished.

14:24.322 --> 14:27.030
- People are dying.
- Which is why you mustn't go.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.566
Or why I must.

14:29.994 --> 14:33.237
I know what it feels like
to be seen as less than human.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.202
A thing transported for money.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.459
You saved me from that.

14:38.628 --> 14:42.588
Which is why I know you'll want me
to try and save others.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.762
I'll fly you back to Thessaloniki...

14:49.931 --> 14:53.345
...then head up to Berlin
and wait for your arrival.

14:53.518 --> 14:57.728
If we lose contact, the task force will
track you from the point of departure.

14:57.897 --> 15:01.390
I can work backwards
from the destination until we find you.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.479
- If something goes wrong...
- It won't.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.861
If it does...

15:08.866 --> 15:10.607
I'll look after your family.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.572
I know you will.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.362
But my concern is who will look after you.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.709
I commend you for getting this far.

15:28.886 --> 15:32.926
Now all that stands between you
and your destination is me.

15:33.099 --> 15:36.183
Do as I say,
and I will make sure you get there.

15:37.061 --> 15:40.930
Disobey me, and I will make sure
that never happens.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.477
Mama.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.609
I'll see you on the other side.

15:52.910 --> 15:56.574
That Chinese ship, you knew
it was in no condition to make that trip...

15:56.747 --> 15:58.909
- ...but you sent it anyway!
- Who told you that?

15:59.083 --> 16:02.372
- Reddington.
- He'd say anything to get his routes back.

16:02.545 --> 16:05.583
No, Colin, I checked it out.
Hundreds dead!

16:05.756 --> 16:09.295
You gave the orders to overcrowd
the ships and the trucks.

16:09.469 --> 16:13.179
We're moving people in equipment unfit
to transport livestock!

16:13.347 --> 16:14.679
Da, listen...

16:14.849 --> 16:16.181
It's my fault.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.842
I thought if I gave you the business,
you'd change.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.854
You've always had a mean streak,
even as a child.

16:22.023 --> 16:27.189
You've proven yourself to be unfit to run
this business. Sorry. You're out!

16:27.361 --> 16:31.025
- You can't do that. Da!
- Get off me. Colin...

16:33.326 --> 16:35.693
- Colin!
- You can't do this.

16:35.870 --> 16:36.906
Do you hear me?!

16:38.122 --> 16:39.158
Colin...

16:41.834 --> 16:43.325
Do you hear me?!

16:50.343 --> 16:51.629
Are they in Macedonia yet?

16:51.802 --> 16:54.089
Yeah, they crossed the border
using tunnels...

16:54.263 --> 16:57.882
- ...along the Suva Reka River.
<i>- Spoke to their minister of internal affairs.</i>

16:58.059 --> 17:00.472
<i>He knows we have agents
in-country watching the van.</i>

17:00.645 --> 17:04.480
That's all we're allowed. Official action
must be taken by the Macedonian police.

17:04.648 --> 17:09.609
Hey, Dembe. Everything is okay.
We've got a solid fix on your location.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.324
Looks like we've hit our first way station.

17:16.702 --> 17:20.570
- Armed guards, gates. Seeing this?
- I clock multiple warehouses.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.415
Rail cars, trucks. A lot of movement.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.871
I have eyes on a second exit,
there must be more.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.332
There's no way we can cover them all.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.458
Out. Out.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.046
No talking. Quick.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.836
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.005
Stay together.

17:38.808 --> 17:39.844
Hurry.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.098
Mama.

17:44.272 --> 17:45.353
I'm scared.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.059
Quiet!

17:48.776 --> 17:50.517
Go, go, go.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.488
<i>Guys, this place is the perfect cover.</i>

17:55.658 --> 17:58.992
<i>A shipping complex housing
over a dozen corporations.</i>

17:59.161 --> 18:01.995
<i>Everything from smartphones
to frozen fish.</i>

18:02.164 --> 18:06.124
Containers moving, how would anyone
know they're packed with people?

18:06.294 --> 18:08.411
Could be looking at more
than a way station.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.830
This could be
the Kilgannons' base of operation.

18:11.007 --> 18:14.967
If it is, there's probably enough evidence
to build a damn good case against them.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.753
We should move, get Dembe
before something goes wrong.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.092
Let's end this
before we're in over our heads.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.974
I'll ask the Macedonians
to secure a warrant.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.098
There, that's Pete's car.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.562
- You sure?
- Yeah.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.202
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like?

18:42.371 --> 18:45.660
- You don't know if he killed your friend.
- You don't know he didn't.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.950
I wanna make sure he doesn't kill us.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.744
You got a problem,
you're welcome to wait in the car.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.671
- I told you we shouldn't do this.
- It will be fine.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.301
We're in a cage.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.262
And the camps were better?

19:04.435 --> 19:05.767
No plumbing or heat.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.598
I know you're scared.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.980
But we made the right decision.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.059
Do you like bunny rabbits?

19:28.376 --> 19:29.833
It's okay.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.557
I'm worried about
how this is affecting her.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.187
- Who is it?
- It's Lena. I need to talk to you.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.943
Lena?

19:59.365 --> 20:01.482
- What are you doing here?
- Miss me?

20:01.659 --> 20:03.070
Where's the suitcase?

20:03.244 --> 20:06.112
- Where are the bones?
- You don't know what they're capable of.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.622
- I know you're capable of killing Nik.
- He said you killed his friend.

20:09.792 --> 20:13.786
Me? If anyone's responsible, it's you.
For what happened to me too.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.545
Oh, my God.

20:16.924 --> 20:20.884
He came into the clinic looking for you.
You disappeared, I was worried.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.340
You lied to her,
why should we believe you?

20:23.514 --> 20:26.222
I don't care what you believe.
You roped us into this.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.600
The guys who did this, they know it.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.557
They knew I'd put in a request
with CODIS.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.223
Don't know how, but they did.
They came to my place...

20:34.400 --> 20:36.437
- ...to get the bones and kill me.
- Kill you?

20:36.610 --> 20:40.149
Yeah, after playing mumblety-peg
to give up names of anyone who knew.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.985
- Which I didn't.
- They did get the suitcase.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.366
And Nik?

20:44.535 --> 20:47.403
He showed up after I passed out.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.948
And when I came to,
I heard a noise, a struggle.

20:51.125 --> 20:56.291
Looked out, I saw this guy had
his arm wrapped around Nik's neck...

20:56.464 --> 20:58.046
...so I ran.

20:58.215 --> 21:02.676
All I know is, if he hadn't shown up,
they would've killed me too.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.179
Up. Time to go. Let's go.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.389
Hurry. Quick.

21:13.481 --> 21:15.143
Quick. Quick.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.275
Move, move, move.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.317
- You, this truck.
- That's our daughter.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.194
That's our daughter!

21:25.367 --> 21:27.484
- Move. I said, move!
- Anna!

21:27.661 --> 21:30.620
- Anna. Wait. Please, that's our daughter.
- Move.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.122
- Don't do this.
- Anna.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.456
No, no, no.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.125
- We lost connection.
- Sounded like he was hit.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.006
- Get him back.
- I can't.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.293
- We need to get in.
<i>- Nobody's going.</i>

21:44.470 --> 21:46.837
I'm not sending you
into a building full of guards.

21:47.014 --> 21:50.678
<i>We were told not to take any action
without the local police.</i>

21:50.851 --> 21:53.013
- I'm begging you...
- Papa!

21:57.900 --> 22:00.313
Tactical units are pulling up now.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.350
He's got a weapon. Look out.

22:42.319 --> 22:45.812
Dembe. You see him?

22:45.990 --> 22:48.573
- I don't have him.
- He's not here.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.993
- Keen, check that truck.
- Let's go.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.037
Dembe.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.549
<i>- Dembe's gone.</i>
- What do you mean, "gone"?

23:10.723 --> 23:13.841
His truck left the premises
before we got to the building.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.931
<i>- He couldn't have gotten far.</i>
- We set a perimeter.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.970
They use tunnels to get into Macedonia.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.935
Somebody in that warehouse...

23:21.108 --> 23:25.318
- ...knows where to find that truck.
- Yeah, I know. We're working on it.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.531
Cornelius Goga.

23:30.618 --> 23:35.329
You're losing a lot of blood.
Hey. Do not pass out on me.

23:35.497 --> 23:39.491
That truck that just left, get on the phone,
contact the driver now.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.125
You won't find them.

23:41.295 --> 23:43.662
Them? How many are still out there?

23:43.839 --> 23:46.297
The minute you raided,
dispatch sent a burn signal...

23:46.467 --> 23:48.504
- ...to our drivers.
<i>- I don't believe you.</i>

23:48.677 --> 23:52.921
<i>You're too late. Our drivers know.
They ditched the trucks, walked away.</i>

23:53.098 --> 23:55.055
<i>Nobody can find them now.</i>

23:55.225 --> 23:58.093
Only our drivers know where they are.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.265
<i>- Cooper?</i>
- We're here.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.726
- Photos you sent are coming through.
<i>- Reddington.</i>

24:02.900 --> 24:06.735
- Here. Tell me what you know.
<i>- Seven trucks are unaccounted for.</i>

24:06.904 --> 24:09.521
Police are looking.
Drivers abandoned them...

24:09.698 --> 24:12.111
- ...in hard-to-find places.
- Dirt roads, garages.

24:12.284 --> 24:15.072
- Find the drivers.
- The drivers are in the wind.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.077
We might have another problem.

24:17.247 --> 24:19.705
The truck in the photo,
is it the same size, style...

24:19.875 --> 24:21.787
- ...as the one we think Dembe's on?
- Yes.

24:21.961 --> 24:26.251
It's a refrigerated truck. Its cargo bay
is airtight. If the truck stops running...

24:26.423 --> 24:29.040
- Air stops circulating.
<i>- Pull up specs on the truck.</i>

24:29.218 --> 24:31.631
Tell us how much oxygen
the cargo bay can hold.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.716
It's not the oxygen that's the problem.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.927
It's the carbon dioxide.
Three percent is fatal.

24:37.101 --> 24:40.720
When the air reaches 3 percent CO2,
everyone will asphyxiate.

24:40.896 --> 24:41.932
How long?

24:42.523 --> 24:43.639
<i>Aram, how long</i> ?

24:43.816 --> 24:46.980
Hang on. Truck's cargo bay is
under 1000 cubic feet.

24:47.152 --> 24:52.773
Average person produces about 1.7 cubic
feet of CO2 per hour times 15 people.

24:52.950 --> 24:56.409
- Maybe two and a half hours?
- I have to go. Do what you can.

24:57.871 --> 25:00.830
Hey, can you hear us?
Why have we stopped?

25:01.417 --> 25:03.534
- You'll give us away.
- Afraid of being caught?

25:03.711 --> 25:05.452
- We're abandoned.
- Someone will come.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.336
Staying calm will not keep us alive.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.465
We have to get out of here.
There's not enough air.

25:13.762 --> 25:14.843
Help me.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.516
It's okay.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.184
Someone will come.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.651
Christ, I'm coming.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.862
- Where's Arthur?
- Sorry...?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.953
I need to see your husband.
It's important I speak to him.

25:44.126 --> 25:46.834
My husband is dead.

25:49.298 --> 25:52.132
Your son. If you could get
your son on the phone.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.338
Whatever on earth is the matter...

25:54.511 --> 25:57.595
Mrs. Kilgannon,
someone I care about a great deal...

25:57.765 --> 26:00.178
...is in danger, I have very little time.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.888
The only person who can help me
is your son.

26:03.270 --> 26:06.934
So unless you want this exchange
to become more heated...

26:07.107 --> 26:09.599
...you'll get him
on the phone immediately.

26:09.777 --> 26:13.316
The entire facility, lost!
You have any idea what that means?

26:13.489 --> 26:16.778
That one location was funding
most of our operation.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.446
- Can't talk.
- The seven trucks...

26:19.620 --> 26:23.705
...that received signals, I need names
and addresses of the drivers.

26:24.166 --> 26:28.376
Reddington. You told my father
I was unfit to run the company.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.537
You tried to push me out.
Why help?

26:30.714 --> 26:33.502
Allow me to pay you
the courtesy of being blunt.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.042
I need your help to find those trucks...

26:36.220 --> 26:38.712
...or I'll have to put a bullet
in your mother's head.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.926
You'll kill my mother?
That's your leverage?

26:41.100 --> 26:43.467
<i>- Five seconds.</i>
- Let's not waste time.

26:43.644 --> 26:46.603
Go ahead. Put her down.
Put a bullet in her.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.890
Would've done it meself eventually.
You can save me the trouble.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.113
I'm so sorry.

27:01.245 --> 27:03.862
Colin drives an old American sports car.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.955
It was very expensive.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.960
He had the vehicle outfitted
with GPS tracking.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.792
If you let me go to my computer...

27:13.423 --> 27:15.631
...I can give you his exact location.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.886
Did I wake you?

27:28.564 --> 27:30.601
I'll make this simple.

27:31.150 --> 27:34.393
I have the suitcase.
And because I have the suitcase...

27:34.570 --> 27:37.859
...I need to speak
with Raymond Reddington.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.115
So here's my offer:

27:41.285 --> 27:44.824
The person who puts me
in contact with him first will live.

27:44.997 --> 27:49.958
I can't guarantee the quality of your life.
But breathing is part of the package.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.372
The other two will die.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.877
Thoughts?

28:01.054 --> 28:02.465
Questions?

28:04.224 --> 28:06.682
I can't tell you what I don't know.

28:07.561 --> 28:10.053
That's more a comment, really.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.723
Tom, tell him, damn it. Tell him.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.018
Look, he's the one who knows.

28:16.195 --> 28:20.690
He ran it all.
He hired me to extract the DNA.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.357
I just ran the search.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.234
I see.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.778
So you're of no use.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.959
No small thing
to betray a man like Reddington.

28:34.129 --> 28:38.920
I'd wanna think about it too.
Unfortunately, you don't have that luxury.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.386
Maybe this will aid in your deliberations.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.798
- Wait! She doesn't know anything.
- I don't. Please.

28:46.975 --> 28:50.935
I won't say anything.
I don't even know where we are.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.599
I could just go.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.935
- I'll just go.
- Go?

28:55.108 --> 28:57.020
You don't have to do this.

28:57.194 --> 29:01.939
Darling, I'm not uncivilized.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.441
I just need the information.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.040
Go.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.502
Go on.

29:17.005 --> 29:19.122
You're free to go.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.852
Then there was one.

29:34.898 --> 29:37.311
Pull docs that tie us to the facility.
Destroy them.

29:37.484 --> 29:41.023
Bank records, payroll,
evidence of our payoffs in the border...

29:43.532 --> 29:48.402
Your mother brought you into this world.
You think she couldn't take you out?

29:52.040 --> 29:54.032
I want the names of those drivers.

29:55.961 --> 29:59.125
Okay. Okay, I can get them.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.961
- They're in his briefcase.
- How convenient.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.170
Who's he?

30:03.343 --> 30:06.381
My financial advisor.
He handles the payroll.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.756
Thanks, Colin.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.287
It's not working.

30:34.124 --> 30:36.081
We need to save the air we have.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.585
- You need to slow your breathing.
- Give me that!

30:57.606 --> 31:00.144
You know what else would save air?

31:03.070 --> 31:04.606
Fewer people.

31:12.913 --> 31:14.996
This just came in from Reddington.

31:15.165 --> 31:17.623
Those are the drivers
who received the burn signal.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.785
- I don't understand...
- He got to Kilgannon.

31:19.961 --> 31:24.171
Got the records. We have names,
addresses, routes they were assigned.

31:24.341 --> 31:28.210
They found three trucks so far.
There's no sign of Dembe.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.424
- How much time left?
- Thirty-five minutes.

31:30.597 --> 31:34.511
We need to find those trucks
before they turn up full of bodies.

31:34.684 --> 31:38.473
Wait. There were seven trucks,
there's only six on this list.

31:38.647 --> 31:41.014
Reddington's going
after Dembe's driver.

31:55.789 --> 31:57.906
- We all don't have to die.
- Sit down.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.290
No. Look.

31:59.459 --> 32:03.294
If there was something we can do to give
a few of us more time to be saved...

32:03.463 --> 32:05.500
- What are you saying?
- I'm sorry.

32:05.674 --> 32:09.008
If there were fewer people,
there will be more air.

32:09.177 --> 32:11.169
- Enough.
- Let him talk.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.587
Who do you propose?

32:12.764 --> 32:16.553
I was thinking by age.
The oldest first. That seems fair.

32:16.726 --> 32:19.218
- Fair to murder my wife?
- Yes.

32:19.396 --> 32:22.764
- To save others.
- And who will do this?

32:23.733 --> 32:25.269
You?

32:25.735 --> 32:29.024
Look her in the eye
as you choke off her last breath.

32:29.197 --> 32:32.736
- I'm not going to die here!
- You will not kill anyone either.

32:32.909 --> 32:35.697
I don't remember
anybody putting you in charge.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.783
Maybe you will go first.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.576
Even with fewer people...

32:43.753 --> 32:45.995
...the air won't last long.

32:46.923 --> 32:50.507
We will not start killing each other
just to die anyway.

32:51.470 --> 32:55.259
Whatever happens, we do it together.

33:08.236 --> 33:11.104
Can you feel that?

33:12.824 --> 33:14.156
Can you hear it?

33:14.326 --> 33:16.409
That's your heartbeat.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.319
Concentrate on it.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.910
Slow it down.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.915
It's okay.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.585
Driver's not here. Too late.

33:29.758 --> 33:33.923
You don't know. His stuff, clothes,
prescriptions, it's there, right?

33:34.095 --> 33:35.711
He knows the police are after him.

33:35.889 --> 33:39.007
<i>He can't run with nothing.
He has to come back.</i>

33:39.184 --> 33:41.471
Ever wonder why Dembe stays with me?

33:41.645 --> 33:45.309
Why anyone so decent
would spend his days...

33:45.482 --> 33:47.724
...at the side of someone so indecent?

33:47.901 --> 33:48.982
<i>You saved him.</i>

33:49.152 --> 33:52.145
He owes you his life. He protects you
because you protected him.

33:52.322 --> 33:53.938
No, Elizabeth.

33:54.115 --> 33:58.029
Dembe didn't stay with me
because he saw me as his savior.

33:58.203 --> 34:01.992
He stayed with me because he saw me
for the man I really was.

34:02.165 --> 34:04.373
<i>A man surrounded by darkness.</i>

34:04.543 --> 34:06.500
No friends who could be trusted.

34:06.670 --> 34:12.291
No faith that loyalty
or love could ever truly exist.

34:13.592 --> 34:14.800
I was...

34:17.347 --> 34:19.885
Well, I was younger then.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.349
Angrier.

34:23.853 --> 34:30.020
Dembe connected his life with mine
to show me that day, and every day...

34:30.193 --> 34:33.812
...that the world is not what I fear it to be.

34:34.364 --> 34:37.777
He is the light in the darkness.

34:37.951 --> 34:39.237
<i>Living proof...</i>

34:39.786 --> 34:42.745
...that there is another way.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.405
That life can be...

34:45.375 --> 34:46.706
...good.

34:46.876 --> 34:49.710
That people can be kind.

34:50.297 --> 34:54.085
That a man like me might one day...

34:54.259 --> 34:57.502
...dream of becoming a man like him.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.587
<i>He pledged his life.</i>

34:59.764 --> 35:04.634
Offered it up as evidence
that I was wrong about this world.

35:05.604 --> 35:11.726
Dembe guards my life because
he's determined to save my soul.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.649
You were wrong.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.241
Nobody knows we're here.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.410
Nobody's coming.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.214
It's okay.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.219
Sleep.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.970
Your parents will be with you
when you wake up.

36:10.752 --> 36:11.959
The truck...

36:12.128 --> 36:13.790
...where is it?

36:19.636 --> 36:21.719
She barely has a pulse.

36:25.809 --> 36:29.302
- Ambulances are on their way!
- She won't make it if we wait.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.037
She's alive.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.834
And sleeping.

36:54.003 --> 36:56.495
The doctors expect a full recovery.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.756
The resilience of the young.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.309
I thought I'd lost you.

37:12.272 --> 37:14.309
Not yet, old friend.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.027
The world can be such
an unsparingly savage place.

37:20.196 --> 37:24.531
One could be forgiven for believing
that evil will triumph in the end.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.533
Those who believe so are wrong.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.696
If you'd died today like that,
it'd be all the proof I needed...

37:29.873 --> 37:32.331
...that you were the one who was wrong.

37:33.293 --> 37:34.750
And here I am.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.621
And here you are.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.963
They found all the trucks.
Packed full of people.

37:47.140 --> 37:50.508
Police say some might not make it,
but we saved a lot of lives.

37:51.102 --> 37:55.563
So they could be deported
like the others at the warehouse?

37:56.357 --> 37:58.269
What about them?

37:58.443 --> 38:02.278
- Ressler is on with Cooper now.
- Fifteen passengers as expected.

38:02.447 --> 38:06.066
Three went to the hospital,
Dembe and Reddington took the girl.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.699
- You have 10 there?
<i>- Correct.</i>

38:07.869 --> 38:10.532
<i>Police are busy
with the warehouse and trucks.</i>

38:10.705 --> 38:13.118
Once everyone's cleared by medical,
they asked us...

38:13.291 --> 38:16.375
...to transport everyone we've got
back to the station house.

38:16.753 --> 38:19.666
Sir, I have to say,
I knew this was happening.

38:19.839 --> 38:23.958
I knew people were risking their lives
by the hundreds of thousands...

38:24.135 --> 38:27.594
...but, I mean, knowing it and seeing it...

38:29.724 --> 38:31.431
It's different.

38:33.937 --> 38:36.975
Agent Ressler, stay on the line.

38:40.276 --> 38:42.268
Harold, I'm here with Dembe.

38:42.445 --> 38:43.856
Dembe.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.613
- Thank God.
<i>- Oh, we have some good news.</i>

38:46.783 --> 38:51.073
It seems the young Anna Elazar
will live to see a brighter day.

38:51.246 --> 38:54.284
Another day, maybe.
I'm not so sure about brighter.

38:54.457 --> 38:57.871
Her parents were arrested. Who knows
how long it'll take to reunite them.

38:58.044 --> 39:01.287
Even then, her future's
at that migrant camp in Greece.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.251
Bleak business, Harold.

39:03.424 --> 39:06.542
<i>As we speak,
my agents are preparing to transport...</i>

39:06.719 --> 39:10.633
<i>...10 recovered migrants
into the custody of Macedonian police.</i>

39:10.807 --> 39:13.675
<i>Ten people,
with only minutes left, perhaps...</i>

39:13.852 --> 39:16.720
<i>...before they wind up back in a cell.</i>

39:16.896 --> 39:19.559
Of course, were my agents
to encounter any resistance...

39:19.732 --> 39:23.396
...while making the trip,
our hands would be tied.

39:24.571 --> 39:27.609
<i>We have no formal authority
in Macedonia. In fact...</i>

39:27.782 --> 39:31.742
...we've been ordered not to engage
with hostiles of any kind.

39:32.245 --> 39:33.736
Donald.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.808
<i>Not sure what'll happen
to the girl and her parents.</i>

39:59.981 --> 40:03.099
<i>Well, I've found
a little bribery goes a long way.</i>

40:48.863 --> 40:51.355
All this time I've given you to think...

40:51.532 --> 40:54.491
...has prompted me
to do some thinking of my own.

40:54.661 --> 40:56.527
And I gotta tell you...

40:56.704 --> 40:58.036
...I'm stumped.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.619
When you consider
all the people on the planet...

41:00.792 --> 41:03.284
...who'd be interested
in the contents of that case...

41:03.461 --> 41:05.999
...and you multiply that number
by a greater number...

41:06.172 --> 41:09.336
...of unspeakable things
those people would do to get it...

41:10.468 --> 41:14.382
...how the hell could it end up
in the hands of a pissant like you?

41:17.183 --> 41:20.426
Maybe because I'm not
the pissant you think I am.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.016
Oh, no? Do tell.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.895
Your man got the drop on me
at the Red Birch.

41:27.068 --> 41:29.560
But that story has a different ending
in a fair fight.

41:30.071 --> 41:32.654
Shame I won't get a chance to see that.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.567
- Thinking time's over.
- Listen, listen, listen.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.947
He's my boss.

41:38.871 --> 41:42.865
We've got a very serious problem.
Someone grabbed Keen...

41:43.042 --> 41:44.408
...and the case.

41:50.925 --> 41:55.386
Wanna know why I had that case? I work
for Reddington. He sent me to get it.

41:55.930 --> 41:59.048
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying. I got a wife and a kid.

41:59.225 --> 42:00.591
I'm not dying here.

42:00.768 --> 42:04.182
Not for you. Not for him.
Not for whatever's in that case.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.189
I don't even know
why everybody wants the thing.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.104
You want Reddington?

42:10.278 --> 42:12.235
I can give him to you.

42:12.655 --> 42:14.487
He trusts me.

42:14.907 --> 42:16.819
I can deliver him to you.

42:16.993 --> 42:19.827
Just give me a chance.
