<i>Previously on</i>
The Shannara Chronicles...

00:02.648 --> 00:04.782
You're not the first girl
to fall for Wil Ohmsford.

00:04.784 --> 00:06.061
Let's just say I've been there.

00:06.068 --> 00:08.519
I trained Bandon
believing he was the one.

00:08.521 --> 00:10.387
I said another had emerged.

00:10.389 --> 00:12.420
Bring me the Codex
or your daughter dies.

00:12.427 --> 00:14.186
Burn the Druid and his
daughter at the stake

00:14.193 --> 00:15.726
and scatter their ashes in the wind.

00:15.728 --> 00:18.529
With your mother captured,
you're the key to Heaven's Well.

00:18.531 --> 00:21.599
If the Warlock Lord returns, he will
be coming for the Well and you.

00:21.601 --> 00:23.534
<i>Why has a mortal boy...</i>

00:24.604 --> 00:26.354
<i>...awoken the Warlock Lord?</i>

00:26.361 --> 00:28.559
I can feel it trying
to get inside my head.

00:28.566 --> 00:30.758
That's because it
senses the darkness in you.

00:30.765 --> 00:32.484
And I'm on the hunt for magic users.

00:32.491 --> 00:33.906
Take him!

00:35.047 --> 00:38.248
The Four Lands will not
be purged of magic.

00:47.621 --> 00:49.126
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

00:49.128 --> 00:51.495
It wasn't meant to end this way.

00:52.865 --> 00:54.043
This isn't the end.

00:57.582 --> 00:59.926
_

01:00.766 --> 01:02.801
Your mother would have been proud.

01:04.376 --> 01:06.777
I guess I can ask her that
myself soon enough.

01:10.449 --> 01:12.218
Burn, you abominations!

01:43.015 --> 01:44.948
Don't breathe.

02:06.439 --> 02:07.471
Are you all right?

02:08.541 --> 02:09.806
Riga has the Codex.

02:12.078 --> 02:13.610
Big book of magic.

02:13.612 --> 02:16.213
If it falls into the hands
of the Warlock Lord,

02:16.215 --> 02:18.540
this war will be over before it's begun.

02:18.547 --> 02:20.079
We must get to Greymark.

02:58.763 --> 03:01.759

03:33.492 --> 03:36.059
It's good to have you back again.

03:36.061 --> 03:37.427
You and I have much to discuss.

03:37.429 --> 03:40.052
Yeah, you're damn right about that.

03:40.059 --> 03:43.127
If you knew who I was the entire
time, why didn't you say anything?

03:43.402 --> 03:45.636
Would you have stayed if I had?

03:46.887 --> 03:48.047
In my experience,

03:48.054 --> 03:51.622
runaway princesses don't usually
like too many questions.

03:51.964 --> 03:54.131
The truth is, your royal
blood didn't matter then.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.907
All I cared was that
you were happy here.

03:58.762 --> 04:01.916
Unfortunately, that's all changed now.

04:01.923 --> 04:05.435
With the Queen dead, you've
inherited more than just a kingdom.

04:05.794 --> 04:08.269
You're the only one
that can open Heaven's Well,

04:08.276 --> 04:11.381
which means the Warlock Lord will stop
at nothing to get his hands on you.

04:13.018 --> 04:14.785
I didn't ask for any of this.

04:15.354 --> 04:17.688
Real heroes never do.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.723
If I'm such a hero,
then why am I here hiding

04:19.725 --> 04:21.836
while everybody else
is out risking their lives?

04:21.843 --> 04:23.226
Because you have no other choice.

04:23.228 --> 04:25.853
I am the Queen of Leah.

04:25.860 --> 04:28.561
And I will do whatever it
takes to protect my people.

04:31.103 --> 04:34.304
If the Warlock Lord finds you
then your people will die,

04:34.306 --> 04:36.501
along with everyone else you love.

04:41.046 --> 04:42.379
I know it's hard,

04:43.282 --> 04:46.149
but do not underestimate our enemy.

04:46.151 --> 04:48.520
As long as this enclave
remains a secret,

04:48.527 --> 04:51.450
it's the only place in the Four
Lands that is safe for you.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.592
I can feel his eyes sometimes,

04:56.962 --> 04:58.462
the Warlock Lord.

05:00.432 --> 05:02.432
It's like he's searching
for me in the dark,

05:02.434 --> 05:04.301
but he just can't see me.

05:05.104 --> 05:06.690
Your mother's necklace.

05:07.485 --> 05:12.188
Its golden Elfstone will protect
you from his prying gaze.

05:12.195 --> 05:15.378
Now, you must never remove it
under any circumstance.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.482
It's your last line of defense.

05:21.954 --> 05:24.621
You know you haven't said
a word in the last three hours.

05:27.128 --> 05:28.461
I wasn't complaining.

05:32.559 --> 05:34.225
You were thinking about her,
weren't you?

05:37.403 --> 05:39.336
I've made my peace with Amberle.

05:41.002 --> 05:42.201
Eretria,

05:43.238 --> 05:44.504
if anything happens to me,

05:45.307 --> 05:47.340
will you keep an eye on Mareth?

05:47.342 --> 05:49.075
What are you talking about?

05:49.082 --> 05:51.311
Nothing, it's just with
everything we're up against,

05:51.313 --> 05:52.741
you never know who might get hurt.

05:56.151 --> 05:58.351
Don't even say that.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.753
As long as I'm around, I won't
let anything happen to you.

06:01.022 --> 06:02.255
Okay?

06:02.872 --> 06:04.125
Aah!

06:17.951 --> 06:18.959
Eretria?

06:19.986 --> 06:21.217
I'm okay.

06:21.452 --> 06:24.544
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's
not what okay looks like.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.613
What's going on with you?

06:28.083 --> 06:29.949
I think I'm losing my mind.

06:30.852 --> 06:32.145
It's more than that.

06:32.512 --> 06:35.395
Something's been bothering
you since we left Arborlon.

06:35.824 --> 06:36.956
I need the truth.

06:38.237 --> 06:39.339
Tell me.

06:40.307 --> 06:42.196
I'm not who you think I am.

06:44.966 --> 06:46.485
I'm not good.

06:51.606 --> 06:54.407
Her darkness grows stronger.

06:59.781 --> 07:02.582
A child of Armageddon,

07:03.985 --> 07:05.351
her mind speaks to me.

07:06.999 --> 07:08.966
Let me show you.

07:22.765 --> 07:24.497
She's with the Shannara.

07:34.729 --> 07:36.863
She is resisting me,

07:37.541 --> 07:39.427
but not for long.

07:39.434 --> 07:41.354
Why are you wasting time with her?

07:41.949 --> 07:44.549
She's nothing but a worthless Rover.

07:44.556 --> 07:47.223
I sense your contempt, boy.

07:47.595 --> 07:49.796
But what is it you desire?

07:51.902 --> 07:53.321
I desire to serve.

07:54.269 --> 07:56.169
Lies!

07:56.171 --> 07:58.145
You will tell me the truth.

08:03.778 --> 08:07.046
What do you desire?

08:09.437 --> 08:11.470
I resurrected he most powerful Druid

08:12.597 --> 08:14.504
so that I could learn from him.

08:15.724 --> 08:17.423
So that I could be as strong as him,

08:19.494 --> 08:22.428
so that no one could ever hurt me again.

08:35.577 --> 08:39.679
So it is power you desire?

08:43.217 --> 08:44.851
Come then,

08:45.720 --> 08:51.390
let me show you the answers you seek.

09:31.285 --> 09:32.832
The Druid's Codex.

09:33.387 --> 09:35.016
Did General Riga have that?

09:37.792 --> 09:38.891
The sum of all magic.

10:26.273 --> 10:27.682
Thank you, master.

10:29.343 --> 10:30.843
I understand now.

10:38.152 --> 10:40.119
What a fool I've been this entire time.

10:41.755 --> 10:44.490
Searching for someone else to lead me,

10:44.992 --> 10:47.092
to show me my destiny.

10:50.652 --> 10:52.964
_

10:55.472 --> 10:57.965
You understand now, child?

10:57.972 --> 10:59.938
I am no child.

10:59.940 --> 11:02.669
It was my power that resurrected you,

11:02.676 --> 11:03.909
remember?

11:05.479 --> 11:07.412
And how did you repay me?

11:07.414 --> 11:09.481
By humiliating me,

11:10.518 --> 11:12.151
just like all the others.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.453
By desecrating Catania.

11:16.824 --> 11:19.158
I am my own master now.

11:35.609 --> 11:37.176
Allanon was right about you.

12:13.247 --> 12:16.114
Cogline tried to teach me
how to control it,

12:18.052 --> 12:20.385
this thing inside me.

12:21.522 --> 12:23.388
I'm trying,

12:25.726 --> 12:30.229
but ever since the eclipse I can
feel the Warlock Lord's magic.

12:31.498 --> 12:32.798
It's...

12:32.800 --> 12:36.168
It's like a chill in my blood,

12:37.071 --> 12:38.637
spreading to my heart.

12:41.690 --> 12:43.992
You are the strongest person
I've ever met.

12:44.945 --> 12:46.044
You can beat this.

12:46.046 --> 12:47.724
No, you don't understand.

12:48.282 --> 12:50.649
Sometimes I like the way it feels.

12:51.151 --> 12:53.386
I know that feeling.

12:53.393 --> 12:55.120
It almost destroyed me.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.456
But I refused to let it win.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.558
But what if my darkness
is stronger than me?

13:03.998 --> 13:05.998
What if I end up like Bandon?

13:23.017 --> 13:25.817
I cannot sense
the Warlock Lord's presence.

13:25.819 --> 13:27.286
He has left this place.

13:48.676 --> 13:50.609
I have failed you.

14:03.023 --> 14:04.525
Over here.

14:13.867 --> 14:15.133
Damn.

14:15.135 --> 14:17.569
I was hoping I'd have
a chance to kill Riga myself.

14:17.905 --> 14:19.416
The Codex.

14:19.430 --> 14:21.296
It's gone. We're too late.

14:21.303 --> 14:23.508
Whether the Warlock Lord has it or not,

14:23.510 --> 14:25.844
he still needs Lyria
to open Heaven's Well.

14:25.846 --> 14:27.079
Then the Well's safe.

14:28.358 --> 14:29.881
Cogline has the girl hidden.

14:29.883 --> 14:32.352
Then we need to get to her
before the Warlock Lord does.

14:32.359 --> 14:34.981
Well, what are we
still standing here for?

14:34.988 --> 14:37.522
No, wait. Mareth and I will find Lyria.

14:37.524 --> 14:39.586
You two must get to Leah immediately.

14:39.593 --> 14:40.645
What for?

14:40.894 --> 14:42.616
If we fail,

14:42.623 --> 14:45.557
you'll be the last line of
defense for Heaven's Well.

14:45.699 --> 14:48.467
You must protect it
from the Warlock Lord.

14:48.890 --> 14:50.135
How?

14:50.142 --> 14:52.376
Leah is still crawling
with Crimson soldiers.

14:55.008 --> 14:57.476
Back in the Border Legion,

14:57.478 --> 15:00.145
I used to tell my men
that an army is like a serpent.

15:07.788 --> 15:09.221
All you have to do

15:09.990 --> 15:11.390
is cut off its head.

15:51.772 --> 15:52.971
Lyria.

15:52.973 --> 15:54.106
You made it.

16:03.617 --> 16:06.785
Wil, Lyria.

16:07.441 --> 16:08.715
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:09.144 --> 16:10.944
Took you long enough.

16:30.010 --> 16:31.810
The Sword of Shannara.

16:31.812 --> 16:34.079
Please tell me the Ellcrys restored it?

16:35.082 --> 16:36.415
Whoa.

16:41.288 --> 16:43.255
We may just win this war yet.

16:47.294 --> 16:49.094
Well done lad.

16:51.065 --> 16:53.265
Looks as new as the day I forged it.

16:54.509 --> 16:56.401
What, you made this sword?

16:57.071 --> 16:58.704
Allanon didn't tell you?

16:59.802 --> 17:02.069
The Sword of Shannara
was my greatest achievement

17:02.076 --> 17:04.710
before I left the order.

17:04.712 --> 17:08.413
Its blade is infused with the
sacred knowledge of the Druids.

17:10.384 --> 17:13.318
Perfect congress of magic and science.

17:13.769 --> 17:17.089
Next time I'll try to be
a little more careful with it.

17:17.090 --> 17:19.358
- Here.
- Thank you.

17:20.876 --> 17:23.983
Did the Ellcrys reveal
what you needed to see?

17:24.527 --> 17:27.506
What, you mean you're actually going
to stay out of my head for once,

17:27.512 --> 17:29.401
instead of just reading my mind?

17:29.870 --> 17:31.303
As my magic wanes,

17:31.305 --> 17:33.472
certain abilities are
no longer within my power.

17:36.310 --> 17:38.410
Well, I guess there's
a silver lining to all this.

17:41.248 --> 17:44.850
Yes, the Ellcrys showed me
what I have to do.

17:44.852 --> 17:46.218
I'm ready.

17:46.220 --> 17:47.652
Then we leave at first light.

17:48.222 --> 17:49.855
What about Lyria?

17:49.857 --> 17:51.289
The queen will stay here.

17:52.026 --> 17:54.192
Rest now.

17:54.194 --> 17:56.294
You'll need all your strength
for the battle to come.

18:16.350 --> 18:17.749
This is it, old friend.

18:18.916 --> 18:20.275
One last stand.

18:23.090 --> 18:26.258
Magic and science, united again.

18:27.227 --> 18:28.293
I have to admit,

18:29.396 --> 18:31.085
Wil isn't quite what I expected.

18:32.566 --> 18:33.799
Was Shea?

18:35.602 --> 18:37.769
What about you?

18:38.972 --> 18:40.539
Are you prepared for what's next?

18:42.443 --> 18:44.543
I still have a fight left in me.

18:44.545 --> 18:46.440
I'm not talking about the fight.

18:47.105 --> 18:50.348
We both know what happens when
you skip the Druid's Sleep.

18:53.067 --> 18:56.202
What will become of our ancient
order once you're gone?

18:57.991 --> 19:00.459
My daughter, Mareth,

19:00.461 --> 19:02.297
she will carry the Druid torch.

19:21.248 --> 19:23.415
It's strange being back here again.

19:25.419 --> 19:28.353
After all the nights
we spent here together.

19:30.619 --> 19:33.692
Those memories feel like
they're from another lifetime.

19:35.389 --> 19:37.622
Then maybe we should make new memories.

19:39.295 --> 19:41.262
I can't do this again.

19:41.768 --> 19:42.901
Do what?

19:43.566 --> 19:44.665
Lose you.

19:45.706 --> 19:48.540
It's not gonna happen again, I promise.

19:49.676 --> 19:51.843
There's nobody left to stop us.

19:52.746 --> 19:54.546
You and I are meant to be together.

19:54.982 --> 19:57.516
I'm getting tired

19:57.518 --> 20:00.352
of people telling me
what I'm meant to be.

20:01.155 --> 20:02.287
What are you talking about?

20:02.289 --> 20:05.724
I'm the one who chooses my future.

20:06.293 --> 20:08.293
Do you understand that?

20:09.196 --> 20:11.307
Me, and no one else.

20:11.314 --> 20:14.182
All of this will be over soon and
we can go back to Leah together.

20:14.189 --> 20:15.414
And then what?

20:15.421 --> 20:17.435
We live happily ever after?

20:18.191 --> 20:19.671
You're talking about a fairy tale.

20:19.673 --> 20:21.473
So what?

20:22.676 --> 20:24.376
