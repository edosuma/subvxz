WEBVTT

00:56.960 --> 00:58.474
We're here about Hess.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.711
Oh, yeah,
you want Gold...

01:00.800 --> 01:02.917
Uh, Max Gold.
He's on his way.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.233
You Gold?

01:18.320 --> 01:19.879
Yeah.
And you're...

01:19.960 --> 01:22.600
We're from Fargo.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.593
Good. They, uh,
said they were
sending someone.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.273
They were right.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.996
There's no library
in this town.

01:32.080 --> 01:34.037
Why is there no
library in this town?

01:34.520 --> 01:36.830
Uh, cutbacks?

01:46.480 --> 01:48.711
He thinks every town
should have a library.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.553
I agree.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.313
Tell him I agree.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.439
Fargo sent us to find out
what happened to Hess.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.040
He got stabbed in
the back of the head

02:05.120 --> 02:08.318
at a strip club is
what happened to him.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.396
Okay.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.278
Okay. Okay,
all right.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.351
Do you believe
this was connected
to the business?

02:37.440 --> 02:39.193
I...

02:39.280 --> 02:40.953
Things have been quiet.

02:41.040 --> 02:45.557
No labor BS,
no skirmishes with
other trucking concerns.

02:45.640 --> 02:46.676
So?

02:46.760 --> 02:48.558
There was a guy.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.472
I told this to Fargo.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.155
He came by the garage
the day it happened.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.200
Brown hair,
just under 6 feet,
not young, not old,

02:57.320 --> 03:00.199
had a cut on
his forehead here.

03:00.280 --> 03:04.513
Said he just wanted
to take a look at Sam,
which he did, then he left.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.236
Look...

03:09.320 --> 03:10.436
Hold on a second.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.110
He was my
friend, okay?

03:25.960 --> 03:26.996
Sam.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.076
Sure, he was a jerk,
but deep down...

03:33.640 --> 03:36.712
All I'm saying is,
you're gonna
find him, right?

03:36.800 --> 03:37.790
The guy who did it.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.479
We'll find him.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.190
How's your
head, then?

04:13.280 --> 04:15.078
Oh, yeah, it's okay.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.800
Aches still, but...

04:17.920 --> 04:19.877
You try that
hot dish?
Oh, yeah.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.599
Real good.
Yeah.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.591
So, you know...
Kitty and I were talking

04:25.680 --> 04:27.990
and we think you should
move in here for a while.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.156
Just stay with us,
you know,

04:29.240 --> 04:32.631
until you get the house
cleaned up or sold.

04:32.720 --> 04:35.235
Why the heck
would I sell the house?

04:35.400 --> 04:36.436
Oh.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.400
Not saying you
have to go that way.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.120
Just, you know,
stay a few days,

04:41.200 --> 04:43.078
until we get
it cleaned up.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.514
Cops left a real mess.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.790
Oh, yeah? Mmm-hmm.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.758
Yeah, the crime
scene and all.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.196
Really turned
the place upside down.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.555
Looking for clues,
I suppose.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.635
How you doing?
You all right? Okay.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.709
You don't have
to do that.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.156
They were piling up.

07:03.240 --> 07:06.756
Vern told me
this story once.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.035
When he was a rookie,

07:08.120 --> 07:11.591
he had a boss who
couldn't tell his shoe
from his foot.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.956
Got killed by
a hail stone.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.760
Just standing
in the parking lot
at the Dairy Queen,

07:16.840 --> 07:18.433
having a milkshake.

07:18.520 --> 07:22.309
Hail stone comes down,
size of a softball,
crushes his skull.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.998
What flavor?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.878
Strawberry, I think.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.798
I was thinking about
when my dad got shot.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.798
Traffic stop, yeah?
Mmm.
Yeah.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.676
He pulled over
the fellas

07:37.760 --> 07:41.117
that robbed Callahan's
and stole the snow plow.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.510
They came to
tell me at school.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.160
I was in algebra.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.435
And he's okay,
you know?

07:48.520 --> 07:52.070
Got the limp, of course,
but, uh, they caught
the guys, so...

07:52.200 --> 07:55.796
The little one
he even got probation.

07:55.880 --> 07:59.430
Convinced the jury
it was a Stockholm
syndrome deal.

07:59.520 --> 08:03.309
Okay, we got now
a list of who will come
by when and do what.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.993
This is on
the due date,
you know?

08:05.080 --> 08:08.869
Get you to the hospital,
bring you home, so,
you're covered.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.155
Say, Bill,
I was thinking.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.836
We should talk
to Lester Nygaard
first thing.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.070
Lester? Ugh.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.516
He already made
a statement back
at the hospital.

08:17.640 --> 08:18.710
Yeah, I know.
I read it.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.154
But, see, thing is,

08:20.240 --> 08:21.720
Vern was on his way
to Lester's house

08:21.800 --> 08:23.075
to talk to him
about Hess' murder,

08:23.160 --> 08:25.197
you know, how possibly
Lester was involved.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.396
Lester?

08:27.080 --> 08:28.355
Ah.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.716
Went to high school
with Lester. Uh...

08:30.800 --> 08:33.520
Had to dissect a mouse
in Mrs. Knutson's class

08:33.600 --> 08:35.239
and poor Lester fainted.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.188
Well, yeah,
okay, but...

08:37.280 --> 08:39.351
Girl had her monthly
once in gym class.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.397
There goes Lester
fainting again.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.472
Right, so he...
he doesn't like blood,
but still...

08:43.559 --> 08:45.074
Plus,
this Hess murder,

08:45.160 --> 08:49.154
got to believe that's
about the cutthroat world
of regional trucking.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.118
Yeah.

08:51.200 --> 08:55.194
So it's, uh,
just coincidence,
you're saying?

08:55.280 --> 08:56.873
Hess gets killed
and then,

08:56.960 --> 08:58.679
the massacre at Lester's
house the next day.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.194
Exactly.

09:00.280 --> 09:03.079
See, I'm thinking
this is home invasion.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.356
You know,
it's a drifter
or some such.

09:05.480 --> 09:09.997
Drug related, maybe,
but not, you know,
Lester Nygaard.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.070
Am I right, Ida?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.560
You're not not right.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.235
But, on these
high-profile deals, Bill,

09:17.320 --> 09:21.200
it never hurts
to talk to the
eyewitnesses yourself.

09:21.280 --> 09:22.396
"Take control
of the facts."

09:22.480 --> 09:24.676
That's what Vern
always used to say.

09:27.160 --> 09:30.039
Okay. Okay, good.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.600
We go see Lester,

09:31.680 --> 09:34.514
but, I do the talking.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.000
Heya, Lester.
Bill.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.719
Mr. Nygaard, uh,
we got some questions
we'd like...

10:53.840 --> 10:56.309
This is Molly.
Deputy Solverson.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.232
Sure. Nice to meet you.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.710
Like I was saying, uh,
we got some questions,
so...

11:00.800 --> 11:02.996
How you
holding up, Lester?
How's the head?

11:03.600 --> 11:05.478
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, it hurts.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.911
Uh, I got a little,
double vision still.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.118
Jeez, well, you know,
if now's not a good time...

11:12.200 --> 11:14.874
No, no,
I was just about to...

11:14.960 --> 11:18.351
I want to help, you know?
It's just there's
so much work to do.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.954
Yeah, sure.
It'll only take
a second.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.710
Oh.

11:32.520 --> 11:36.480
All I got is grape juice.
Hope that's okay. Ugh.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.031
Pearl says it reminds her
of being a kid.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.157
Said.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.039
Uh, remember that gum.

11:45.120 --> 11:48.033
That grape gum
that they had
when we were kids?

11:48.120 --> 11:50.316
Heck, what was
that called?

11:52.280 --> 11:54.590
Uh, so we got
your statement
from the hospital.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.796
Oh, yeah.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.240
Yeah, I...
I was real thorough
with those fellas.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.674
I... I mean,
what I could remember.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.433
Doctor says
I got a concussion.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.794
Says if I was hit
any harder,

12:05.880 --> 12:07.951
my brain could've swoll up
and leaked right out my ears.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.560
Oh!

12:09.720 --> 12:11.791
Thank gosh
that didn't happen.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.190
Uh, in your statement,
you said that, um,

12:14.280 --> 12:16.351
you came home
and found your wife,
that...

12:16.440 --> 12:17.635
that she was
already dead.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.393
Uh, downstairs, yeah.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.631
I heard the washer going...

12:23.320 --> 12:25.755
spin cycle...
and I...

12:25.840 --> 12:28.071
Well, you know, she...
she was on the floor,

12:28.160 --> 12:29.355
you know,
and there was
a lot of...

12:29.440 --> 12:30.840
I never even
heard the guy.

12:30.920 --> 12:36.075
Uh, just one minute
I'm, uh,
looking at her...

12:36.160 --> 12:38.197
and the next...

12:38.280 --> 12:42.115
So, uh, you don't
remember Chief Thurman
coming to the house then?

12:42.240 --> 12:44.800
Oh, no, no.
I feel sick
about that, really.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.792
I guess he saw
the guy breaking in.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.872
Uh, no, Mr. Nygaard.
Uh...

12:49.320 --> 12:51.073
Chief Thurman
came to talk to you

12:51.160 --> 12:55.313
about a man you may
have met in the emergency
room the day previous.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.274
Hmm, you don't say.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.919
Look, Lester,

13:00.000 --> 13:01.992
if this is too
hard for you,

13:02.080 --> 13:03.116
you can just give us
the bare bones...

13:03.200 --> 13:05.237
We got a witness
says that, uh...

13:05.320 --> 13:09.792
she saw you and
this other fella arguing
about Sam Hess.

13:13.720 --> 13:14.676
Who?

13:14.760 --> 13:16.274
Sam Hess.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.033
You remember Sam.
He used to beat you
up in high school.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.110
What?

13:21.200 --> 13:24.318
Oh, yeah, Sam had a thing
for ol' Lester here.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.312
Used to chase him
around the schoolyard

13:26.400 --> 13:28.278
till one or the other
ran out of gas.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.477
You remember...
big kid. Uh...

13:30.560 --> 13:33.075
What was that
name he called you?
Lester Nig...

13:33.160 --> 13:35.152
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, Sam.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.833
Yeah.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.359
That... that was
a long time ago.
Oh...

13:40.440 --> 13:42.432
But,

13:42.520 --> 13:44.477
you were talking about him
in the emergency room,

13:44.560 --> 13:45.710
so what's the story there?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.600
Well, I, uh...

13:57.760 --> 14:02.391
Hmm, it's real fuzzy,
but I might have said,
uh,

14:02.560 --> 14:04.074
"My face is a mess."

14:05.120 --> 14:07.954
Mess sounds like Hess,
so probably your, uh,

14:08.040 --> 14:09.520
the witness just misheard.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.478
Yeah, that's possible.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.519
Can you describe
the fella?

14:15.320 --> 14:17.676
Height, eye color,
that kind of thing?

14:17.760 --> 14:20.355
You know,
the last few days,
they're real fuzzy.

14:20.440 --> 14:24.400
Reason we asks is,
we got an operating
theory, okay?

14:24.480 --> 14:29.077
This being the work
of a drifter...
or drifters...

14:29.160 --> 14:30.913
possibly drug-related.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.198
See...
I'm thinking this fella
you met at the hospital...

14:34.320 --> 14:36.198
maybe he followed
you home...
That's not...

14:36.280 --> 14:37.350
We don't both...
share that theory. So...

14:37.480 --> 14:39.278
No, but... Yeah.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.720
I... I'm a little scrambled
right now.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.315
Uh, I... I got a concussion.
I'm not sure if I said that.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.756
So, uh,
yeah, things...

14:52.720 --> 14:55.360
things are
kind of fuzzy.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.196
Well,
you know what?

14:58.280 --> 14:59.475
I'm satisfied.

15:01.240 --> 15:02.720
I've actually...
I got a few
more questions...

15:02.800 --> 15:05.554
Yeah. Thanks for
the grape juice, Lester.
Uh...

15:05.640 --> 15:07.233
Takes me back,
I tell you.

15:07.320 --> 15:08.515
And, uh,
I'm gonna

15:08.600 --> 15:10.080
look up the name
of that gum
when I get home.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.311
Hubba Bubba.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.751
Hubba Bubba, yeah,
yeah, Hubba Bubba.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.513
We used to
crack up about that.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.636
Do you remember
Hubba Bubba?

15:18.720 --> 15:20.439
No.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.433
If you need
anything, Lester,
you give us a call.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.797
'Cause I'll tell you what,
this is a tragedy.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.351
Straight-up,
dyed-in-the-wool
tragedy.

15:32.280 --> 15:33.919
She was a good woman,
you know.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.911
Good wife.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.999
I...
I just keep
asking myself...

15:43.160 --> 15:45.675
"Who could've done
a thing like this?"

16:17.240 --> 16:19.232
Good morning,
young fella.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.515
You have a package
for me?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.034
All righty,
what's your name?

16:22.120 --> 16:23.270
Why?

16:24.560 --> 16:26.552
So I can find
the package.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.510
Duluth.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.080
I'm sorry?

16:31.160 --> 16:33.436
The package is
addressed to "Duluth."

16:33.520 --> 16:36.274
Eh, that's a city.
I need your name.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.033
I told you my name.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.873
Your name's Duluth?

16:42.880 --> 16:45.076
Well, I'll need
to see some ID.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.070
No.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.230
What?

16:48.360 --> 16:49.760
You heard me.

16:50.680 --> 16:56.153
Well, I can't
give you your mail
if you don't show ID.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.277
Sure you can.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.397
All you gotta do
is look through those
packages over there,

17:00.480 --> 17:02.915
find the one
addressed to "Duluth"
and then hand it to me.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.516
Look, son,
we're in Duluth,

17:06.599 --> 17:11.277
so technically,
all the mail is
addressed to "Duluth."

17:13.720 --> 17:16.440
Am I gonna need
to come back there
and find it myself?

17:17.319 --> 17:19.277
Sir?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.434
Okay.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.676
This is highly irregular.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.433
No, highly irregular
is the time

17:39.520 --> 17:42.115
I found a human foot
in a toaster oven.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.237
This is just odd.

17:57.480 --> 17:58.470
Uh.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.632
I'm a minister, apparently.

18:21.720 --> 18:22.790
Sir?

18:27.400 --> 18:29.312
You have
a blessed day.
Mmm.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.874
Missed a spot.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.278
<i>You're looking at the 
Supermarket King of Minnesota,</i>

19:14.360 --> 19:15.476
La Mercado Rey.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.791
<i>Twenty-nine markets
in 15 counties...</i>

19:18.160 --> 19:21.551
and it all
started right here,
in this office.

19:21.680 --> 19:25.151
Next quarter, we're
expanding into Wisconsin
and the Dakotas.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.040
By this time
next year,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.073
I'll rule the whole
goddamn Midwest.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.038
You see my mangoes?

19:31.120 --> 19:32.839
Straight from Ecuador.
Kiwis, too.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.470
That's what makes my stores
so goddamn superior.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.155
I got mangoes in
goddamn January...

19:40.600 --> 19:42.193
and the back of
a 90-year-old woman.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.953
God damn it.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.434
Who's the fire hydrant?

19:50.760 --> 19:53.036
Semenko,

19:53.120 --> 19:54.679
head of security.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.433
You an Oilers fan?

19:56.520 --> 19:59.797
Wally here is 1992
Farm League MVP.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.872
Knocked 138 heads
career-wise.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.350
Ain't that right, Wally?

20:04.440 --> 20:07.990
Our mutual friend
said something about
a blackmail letter?

20:17.160 --> 20:20.995
Found this on my
windshield last week.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.312
What does this mean,
"I know about the money"?

20:25.400 --> 20:27.710
What it means
don't matter.

20:27.800 --> 20:28.870
It's blackmail.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.713
I didn't bring you here
for what it means.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.076
I brought you here
to make it stop.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.150
Semenko said, "Don't do it."
He said...

20:34.240 --> 20:35.720
he said, "Let me handle it."

20:35.800 --> 20:37.837
But you don't get
to be <i>La Mercado Rey</i>

20:37.920 --> 20:38.990
without knowing
when to delegate.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.757
That's a pretty
specific number,
$43,613.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.196
Hell, maybe
he wants to pay off
his student loans.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.476
I don't know.
What matters is,
can you find the guy?

20:50.600 --> 20:52.910
Hey, Dad,
got a good one
for you.

20:53.000 --> 20:53.956
Oh, sorry.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.272
Don't you know
closed door means
"keep out," boy,

20:57.400 --> 20:59.437
or at least knock,
for shit's sake?

20:59.520 --> 21:01.079
You'll like this.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.356
What's a karate expert's
favorite beverage?

21:04.960 --> 21:06.917
Kara-tea.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.151
Get it?

21:09.240 --> 21:12.278
Kara-tea.

21:12.360 --> 21:15.273
It's... it's tea.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.477
Son, get the hell out.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.035
Nice to meet you.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.433
Look, I can find the guy.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.159
The question is,

21:27.240 --> 21:29.391
what do you
want done with him
once he's found?

21:29.480 --> 21:32.598
Send him packing.
Isn't that what they say?

21:32.680 --> 21:33.955
Who says that?

21:34.040 --> 21:35.235
In the movies.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.714
I don't watch movies.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.951
You don't watch movies?

21:40.040 --> 21:42.635
Look...
this ain't complicated.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.030
You don't get to be
the Supermarket
King of Minnesota

21:45.120 --> 21:47.316
without making
a few enemies,
all right?

21:47.400 --> 21:49.232
Start with my damn wife.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.030
You think your wife's
blackmailing you?

21:54.120 --> 21:55.713
You ever nail
a Greek woman?

21:55.800 --> 21:59.077
After 40,
their pussies grow teeth.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.150
And she ain't my wife.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.993
She's my
soon-to-be ex-wife,

22:02.080 --> 22:04.072
and she is suing
me for 50%.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.309
Except now,
I'm starting to think

22:08.400 --> 22:09.550
maybe 50% ain't
enough for her.

22:12.320 --> 22:15.677
This is kind
of embarrassing,
but, uh,

22:15.760 --> 22:18.116
would you sign
a copy of my book?

22:20.720 --> 22:23.189
I'd be delighted.

22:23.320 --> 22:26.677
You, uh, you want
something personal?

22:26.760 --> 22:28.831
Yeah, could you put,
"To Frank Peterson,

22:28.920 --> 22:30.957
"thanks for nailing
my blackmailer."

22:34.040 --> 22:38.353
I'm just kidding.
Anything you want.
You're the writer.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.829
In addition to the victims
in the basement,

23:06.920 --> 23:09.480
that's Nygaard,
Mr. and Mrs.,

23:09.560 --> 23:10.835
we're hearing
the chief of police

23:10.920 --> 23:13.879
was shot-gunned
in the foyer.

23:14.800 --> 23:15.790
That means entryway.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.637
No description
yet of the suspect
or suspects,

23:19.720 --> 23:21.632
but I told the new chief
over in Bemidji

23:21.720 --> 23:25.509
we'd be on high alert
for anything that connects.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.000
That means
suspicious persons

23:27.080 --> 23:28.514
or jailhouse snitches
saying they know a thing.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.039
Okay, let's get to it.

23:39.680 --> 23:40.830
Grimly.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.356
Animal Control guy called in sick again.
You're on duty.

23:45.440 --> 23:46.669
Yes, sir.

24:29.040 --> 24:32.112
I got "aurora borealis."
What about you? Over.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.960
<i>I just put "northern lights." Over.</i>

24:35.040 --> 24:37.191
Um, my dad's home
with dinner. Over.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.158
<i>What's it tonight? Over.</i>

24:39.240 --> 24:41.311
It looks like
burgers. Over.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.119
And chicken nuggets.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.237
And chicken nuggets.
Over and out.

25:32.440 --> 25:33.669
You get
the dipping sauces?

25:33.800 --> 25:35.393
Extra, even.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.470
Oh.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.869
Good day?

25:42.960 --> 25:44.314
Yeah.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.199
We, um,
we had an assembly...

25:47.280 --> 25:50.398
and the principal
talked about bullying
and how bullying was wrong

25:50.480 --> 25:52.392
and if we saw
somebody getting bullied,

25:52.480 --> 25:54.392
we should
say something
or stop it.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.030
And I raised my hand,

25:57.840 --> 25:59.433
and I asked
what you're supposed
to do

25:59.520 --> 26:01.716
if the bully is, like,
a lot bigger than you

26:01.800 --> 26:05.316
or has a knife
or something.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.480
And what did he say?

26:08.560 --> 26:10.995
He said if the bully
has a knife, then,

26:11.080 --> 26:13.390
you should tell
a grown-up.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.278
Well, that's good advice.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.920
Yeah, but,
what if there's no time?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.117
I mean,
you're the police.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.637
If you saw somebody
doing something,
you'd stop 'em, right?

26:24.640 --> 26:26.677
Well, you know,

26:26.760 --> 26:28.877
sometimes there's more
than one right thing.

26:29.760 --> 26:30.830
What does that mean?

26:37.280 --> 26:38.634
It means,

26:40.840 --> 26:45.198
I got you, and I am
responsible for you...

26:45.280 --> 26:47.192
and sometimes,

26:47.280 --> 26:51.240
I might be in
a situation where,

26:51.320 --> 26:52.834
and this hasn't happened
and it won't,

26:53.680 --> 26:55.637
but a situation where...

26:55.720 --> 26:59.270
if I try to stop a guy
from doing a bad thing,

26:59.360 --> 27:02.000
I could get hurt,

27:02.080 --> 27:04.640
or worse.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.996
And then, who would
take care of you?

27:08.040 --> 27:09.030
But it's your job.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.112
Well, I got two jobs,

27:12.200 --> 27:14.920
and the first,
the most important,
is being your dad.

27:16.880 --> 27:20.556
Well,
if I saw somebody
doing something...

27:20.640 --> 27:21.869
I would stop 'em.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.713
I believe you would.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.559
Every cooperation,
obviously.

27:41.680 --> 27:46.277
If you want the girl,
if you want drug,
just ask.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.589
You know who we are.

27:49.680 --> 27:51.273
I told the police,

27:51.360 --> 27:54.512
I couldn't see the guy
on account of the blood
being in my eyes.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.000
We got a description
of a man.

27:56.080 --> 27:59.630
5'10", brown hair,
big bruise on
the forehead.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.837
Does it ring
a bell at all?

28:04.760 --> 28:06.513
Could be Lenny.
Who's Lenny?

28:06.600 --> 28:08.398
Comes in here a lot.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.800
Drinks pretty heavy.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.952
I heard him say
a few things over the years
about guys like Hess.

28:13.760 --> 28:17.993
Money in the pocket,
think they're tough shit.

28:18.080 --> 28:22.074
That's him at the bar
with the Band-Aid
on his head.

28:31.360 --> 28:34.398
Well, the Russians,
they used to send
dogs up into space

28:34.480 --> 28:37.917
which is stupid
because what's a dog
gonna do in space?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.036
At least with a monkey,

28:39.120 --> 28:41.237
they can operate
the, uh,

28:41.320 --> 28:42.959
the equipment
and something.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.554
Hey, my friend would
like an orange soda

28:48.640 --> 28:51.553
and I'll have, uh,
just a cup of hot
water with lemon.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.792
What are you
supposed to be, some
kind of, uh, circus act?

28:58.320 --> 29:00.915
Oh, my friend was
wondering, how'd you, uh,
hurt your head?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.151
Oh, is your friend
looking for a date?

29:03.240 --> 29:05.436
'Cause you know
this is a place for dicks
who like pussies,

29:05.520 --> 29:07.113
not pussies
who like dick.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.590
No, seriously,
how'd you hurt
your head?

29:09.680 --> 29:10.909
Screw.

29:13.600 --> 29:16.195
I ain't afraid of
a dink and a lepton.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.277
You like playing
with knives?

29:22.360 --> 29:25.592
Oh, you keep
talking, big boy,
you're gonna find out.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.713
That the guy?

29:53.560 --> 29:56.029
Can you take off
the tape maybe?

30:00.280 --> 30:02.590
God damn
you little bastards!
I'll kill the lot of you!

30:05.440 --> 30:08.751
Hey, now,
look, okay?

30:08.840 --> 30:10.559
I'm sorry for what
I said to you before

30:10.640 --> 30:12.233
about the dink
and the lepton.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.635
I don't think
it's him.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.994
Delicious.
Just a few more.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.436
What'd you say
your name was again,
handsome?

30:34.360 --> 30:37.592
Frank Peterson, ma'am.
I work for Mike,
your divorce attorney.

30:37.760 --> 30:40.150
Ah, charmed,
I'm sure.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.437
Oh, sorry,
I just bronzed.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.353
He's a pig.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.840
You smelled his hands?

30:49.760 --> 30:51.479
Have I smelled
your husband's hands?

30:51.560 --> 30:54.120
They smell like feet.

30:54.200 --> 30:57.272
Your ass looks
amazing, darling.
Keep it up.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.117
So anyway, uh,
I've been tasked

31:00.200 --> 31:03.477
to put together
a complete record
of your husband's assets.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.837
We want to get you
the biggest divorce
settlement possible.

31:06.920 --> 31:11.631
Now, I've got your
husband's net worth
estimated at $10 million?

31:11.720 --> 31:13.677
More.

31:13.760 --> 31:14.750
Fifteen?

31:16.440 --> 31:19.160
Okay, sweetie, uh,
let's do a cool down,
yeah? Five minutes.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.959
There you go.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.239
Ma'am, can you
confirm that

31:24.360 --> 31:27.717
your husband started
his first grocery with
a loan from his uncle

31:27.800 --> 31:29.792
like it says
in the book?

31:31.280 --> 31:33.590
That's the story.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.239
But you don't believe it?

31:35.320 --> 31:36.913
Stavros
had two uncles.

31:37.080 --> 31:39.754
One was a drunk
who lived in a barn...

31:39.840 --> 31:42.560
and the other died
in a fishing accident
when he was 10.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.155
So where did
the money come from?

31:45.240 --> 31:46.469
Hey, Ma.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.034
Frank Peterson.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.918
Oh, yeah,
from the store.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.036
Hey, I got one
for you.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.476
What kind of bone
will a dog never eat?

31:56.040 --> 31:57.235
Huh.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.320
Chicken?

32:01.160 --> 32:03.072
A trombone.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.952
Oh, yeah.

32:06.040 --> 32:09.078
That's a good one.
A trombone.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.072
Oh, my dad'll
like that one.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.152
Your dad,
your dad.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.469
Your dad's
screwing us, mister.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.596
Mommy.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.433
What? I'm just
being honest.

32:17.520 --> 32:20.752
He's a hard-on,
your father,
and you're too trusting.

32:20.840 --> 32:23.071
But he's my dad
and you're my mom

32:23.160 --> 32:25.755
and everything's
gonna work out, okay?

32:26.200 --> 32:27.270
Mmm.
Oh.

32:30.520 --> 32:34.116
Aren't they just
the sweetest pair?
Mmm?

32:36.680 --> 32:39.479
<i>Yeah, it's... it's... it's me.
It's Lester.</i>

32:40.160 --> 32:43.039
<i>Uh, she's, um... My wife...
 my wife, she's, uh...</i>

32:43.120 --> 32:44.349
<i>Oh, hell!</i>

32:44.480 --> 32:45.470
<i>Um...</i>

32:46.360 --> 32:48.477
<i>I think I, uh...</i>

32:48.560 --> 32:51.280
<i>She's in the basement
dead and, uh...</i>

32:51.360 --> 32:53.875
<i>Look, I'm freaking out here.
I don't know what to do.</i>

32:59.560 --> 33:02.553
<i>Yeah, it's... it's... 
it's me. It's Lester.</i>

33:03.080 --> 33:05.993
<i>Uh, she's, um... My wife... 
my wife, she's, uh...</i>

33:06.080 --> 33:07.309
<i>Oh, hell!</i>

33:07.400 --> 33:08.390
<i>Um...</i>

33:09.080 --> 33:10.230
<i>I think I, uh...</i>

33:12.920 --> 33:15.196
<i>She's in the basement
dead and, uh...</i>

33:15.280 --> 33:17.556
<i>Look, I'm freaking out here.
I don't know what to do.</i>

33:17.680 --> 33:19.831
<i>Lester, have you
been a bad boy?</i>

33:19.920 --> 33:22.151
<i>Jeez. Yeah...</i>

33:22.240 --> 33:23.833
Oh, sorry,
I just bronzed.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.037
<i>...I took the hammer
and, uh...</i>

33:26.120 --> 33:30.717
<i>Look, can you come over?
I'm on Willow Creek Drive, number 613.</i>

33:31.960 --> 33:33.713
<i>Please! Please?</i>

33:36.760 --> 33:39.559
<i>Sure, Lester.
I'll be right there.</i>

33:54.160 --> 33:56.152
This place is a shithole.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.952
Okay, nutsack, here's the drill.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.951
You're gonna pack up
your shit and blow.

34:04.040 --> 34:06.999
I'll tell Stavros you 
couldn't find the guy,

34:07.080 --> 34:10.277
and in return,
I won't bust your head.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.510
You hearing me, asswipe?

34:14.960 --> 34:17.998
I did some digging on you, made 
some calls, you get me?

34:19.320 --> 34:22.074
And we don't need you and your 
big city connections

34:22.159 --> 34:24.516
coming here and showing us
what time it is.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.237
I'm the guy.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.072
You understand? Me.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.594
Twenty years I work
for the King.

34:34.679 --> 34:35.909
You know what that makes me?

34:36.000 --> 34:39.311
The goddamn
prime minister.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.393
So give me the letter,
pack up your shit and...

34:47.520 --> 34:48.748
What the hell you doing?

34:54.480 --> 34:55.960
That's disgusting.

35:06.680 --> 35:08.194
Okay, slick.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.876
I got your number.
I'm on to you.

35:11.960 --> 35:14.520
Just remember,
you were warned.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.796
Semenko warned you.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.918
Uh, hey, Molly?

35:49.880 --> 35:50.870
Yeah, Chief?

35:51.000 --> 35:54.311
So, just want to make sure
we're on the same page
about everything.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.629
I want you to center it.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.916
Same page
about what?

35:58.000 --> 36:01.676
Just about Lester
and the case, you know.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.673
Just want to make sure
you know to focus on
the break-in angle.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.753
Maybe call some other
towns, see if they had
a similar problem.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.433
No, higher.

36:10.480 --> 36:12.756
Similar to three murders,
including the police chief?

36:14.080 --> 36:15.878
Not, you know,
literally.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.395
Just ruffians
and the like.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.800
Right there. Perfect.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.752
Look, Chief, I know
you don't think Lester...

36:22.840 --> 36:24.513
Maybe call the Staties,
you know?

36:24.600 --> 36:26.592
See if they effected
any car stops,

36:26.680 --> 36:28.194
suspicious types...

36:28.280 --> 36:30.112
where the driver
had a head wound
and the like.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.475
Yeah.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.358
Yeah, but I think, uh,
Just...

36:33.440 --> 36:36.194
leave poor Lester
alone, will you?

37:55.360 --> 37:57.113
You'll be
in Gordo's room.

37:57.200 --> 38:00.238
He's on the sofa
which is... Ha!

38:00.320 --> 38:03.552
Don't worry.
His dad built him a fort.
He loves it.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.195
Ugh.

38:44.240 --> 38:47.278
<i>Baby, it's cold outside! Brr.</i>

38:47.360 --> 38:50.797
<i>But here at Phoenix Farms,
it's always summer.</i>

38:51.920 --> 38:53.149
Real good peas, hon.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.038
Yeah, Mom, real good.

38:57.640 --> 38:58.835
How's your dinner
there, Lester?

38:58.920 --> 39:01.958
Oh, yeah. Real good.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.440
I was thinking of going hunting
this weekend.

39:03.560 --> 39:07.520
Mmm-hmm.
Told Gordo I would
take him shooting.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.114
You interested?

39:10.720 --> 39:12.040
Ah...
Now, hon,
I don't think

39:12.160 --> 39:14.675
your brother wants
to be around all
that guns and violence,

39:14.760 --> 39:16.319
not... not after
what happened.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.680
Oh, shoot, I'm sorry.
No, no, it's fine.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.638
I can be a real
ass sometimes.
Language.

39:22.720 --> 39:26.191
No, no, no, I...
It sounds, um...

39:26.280 --> 39:30.479
You know, you know,
bag a deer or something.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.913
So, I... I've been thinking,
maybe I should sell
the place, you know?

39:35.000 --> 39:38.471
Get a...
What do you call it,
a fresh start?

39:38.560 --> 39:41.678
Yeah? That's
great. Mmm.

39:41.760 --> 39:43.877
I'll call Jimmy.

39:43.960 --> 39:47.192
It's a fine market
right now he says.
Real good.

39:47.320 --> 39:49.676
It is the right choice,
sweetie.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.269
Too many bad memories
in that old house.
Mmm-hmm.

39:52.360 --> 39:54.192
Both Chaz
and me think so.
Oh!

39:54.280 --> 39:55.680
Oh, jeez!
Mmm.

39:55.760 --> 39:56.876
Oh, I am...
I am so sorry.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.030
It's okay.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.998
I'm sorry.
It's fine.

40:08.640 --> 40:09.676
Hi.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.233
What can I
do for you, son?

40:13.320 --> 40:16.438
Well, uh, I got a...

40:16.520 --> 40:18.796
I need something for
a wound,
I guess you'd call it.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.520
Are we talking pain pill
or something more topical?

40:21.600 --> 40:23.239
Well, it's...

40:23.320 --> 40:27.360
I guess, um,
something to keep it
from getting infected.

40:27.440 --> 40:30.000
Okay, that'd be
an anti-bacterial.
All right.

40:30.080 --> 40:31.958
I got some in the back.

40:34.360 --> 40:35.555
Mr. Nygaard?

40:35.640 --> 40:36.756
Yeah? Ooh!

40:36.840 --> 40:38.399
Hiya.
Hi.

40:38.480 --> 40:39.470
Deputy Solverson again.

40:39.560 --> 40:42.871
I just have
a few more questions.
Is now a good time?

40:43.000 --> 40:44.275
Not really.
I'm kind of in
the middle of...

40:44.360 --> 40:45.589
Sure. Yeah, no,
I understand.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.399
Yeah, it won't
take a second.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.437
Um, so listen,
going back to
the emergency room,

40:49.520 --> 40:52.399
that... that first visit,
that was for a broken
nose, is that right?

40:52.480 --> 40:55.439
Shoot, I...
I just remembered.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.840
Um, sir...

40:57.920 --> 40:59.434
You know, I...
I got to be honest.

40:59.560 --> 41:03.474
I'm starting to feel
a little harassed here.

41:03.560 --> 41:04.710
Now, that's not...

41:04.800 --> 41:06.200
Sir, your unguent!

41:08.120 --> 41:09.190
Sir!

41:10.400 --> 41:11.675
I think he means you.

41:13.520 --> 41:15.591
You know,
you're asking
about a fella,

41:15.680 --> 41:17.956
that I might've talked
to at the hospital,

41:18.040 --> 41:19.110
when you should
be out there

41:19.200 --> 41:22.159
looking for the animal
that killed my wife.

41:22.240 --> 41:25.312
With all respect, sir,
your wife's not
the only victim here.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.198
A friend of mine
was killed,

41:27.280 --> 41:29.033
plus, you know,
Sam Hess.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.999
Yeah, I told you,
I haven't seen Sam
since high school.

41:35.600 --> 41:38.160
I'm not sure
this is your car,
Mr. Nygaard.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.117
What? Oh, no, it's...

41:41.200 --> 41:42.998
It's my wife's.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.719
Mine's in the shop.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.679
Well, sir, it's just...
it's hard to believe
is all, you know?

41:47.760 --> 41:50.116
I mean, you're saying
this is all some...
some big coincidence,

41:50.200 --> 41:52.192
you know,
you knowing Sam and all.

41:52.320 --> 41:53.310
And it's a quiet town

41:53.400 --> 41:55.596
and suddenly we got
four victims in 24 hours,

41:55.680 --> 41:56.670
yourself included.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.513
And then there's
this witness

41:58.600 --> 42:01.399
saying that you were
talking about Sam Hess
the day he died

42:01.480 --> 42:02.755
and, you know,
then it turns out

42:02.840 --> 42:05.514
you and he
had differences
in the past, so...

42:05.600 --> 42:08.069
You know,
all I'm saying is,
just...

42:08.160 --> 42:10.391
help me understand
what happened.

42:10.480 --> 42:14.554
Look,
I answered all your...
Just ask Bill, huh?

42:15.360 --> 42:18.831
Your boss, he said
he was satisfied.

42:18.920 --> 42:20.434
And I... I got...
Look at me.

42:22.080 --> 42:24.549
My wife

42:24.640 --> 42:26.154
is dead,

42:26.240 --> 42:27.196
and you're harassing me.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.999
I'm not harassing
you, sir. I...

42:29.080 --> 42:30.560
Talk to Bill!

42:31.120 --> 42:33.032
He'll tell you this...
this was a break-in.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.112
You're wasting time
talking to me.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.800
I'm...
I can't help you.

42:37.880 --> 42:39.280
Watch your feet now.

43:05.320 --> 43:06.640
So, how's it going?

43:07.840 --> 43:10.594
Uh, well, it turns out
Lester and Hess went
to high school together

43:10.680 --> 43:12.876
and Hess used
to beat him up.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.837
A learned detective
might consider that a clue.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.355
Yeah, that's what
I said.

43:19.440 --> 43:22.114
But Bill's a big believer
in coincidence, apparently.

43:22.200 --> 43:25.557
Well, what he lacks
in common sense
he makes up in self-esteem.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.710
Yeah.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.074
Bill have a theory?

43:30.160 --> 43:33.949
Oh, yeah, he says
that it was a spree,
you know?

43:34.040 --> 43:37.511
A drifter or, quote,
gang of drifters.

43:37.600 --> 43:39.193
You know, like it's 1942.

43:39.280 --> 43:42.478
Like, uh, drifters
are a national threat.
Hobos.

43:44.920 --> 43:49.358
Well, he's chief now,
so he sets the agenda,
same as always.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.233
Yeah, I know.
It's just...

43:52.240 --> 43:54.550
I mean, you know,
here we get
this car crash

43:54.640 --> 43:57.519
with this dead man
in frozen panties nearby,

43:57.600 --> 43:58.954
and the driver
has a head injury

43:59.040 --> 44:00.394
and maybe went to
the emergency room

44:00.480 --> 44:02.836
where he talked to Lester
about Sam Hess,

44:02.920 --> 44:05.640
and then within 24 hours,
Hess is dead

44:05.720 --> 44:09.873
and then there's
the fracas with, you know,
Lester's wife and Vern.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.675
Not sure
if you remember,

44:15.760 --> 44:16.750
but when you were five,

44:16.880 --> 44:20.510
they had to put
you under anesthesia
to fix your teeth.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.752
Gave you that mask
and gas that smelled
like tutti-frutti.

44:23.840 --> 44:24.830
Yeah.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.914
My soft, little girl
in a hard world of
drills and needles.

44:30.800 --> 44:33.838
I'm 31, Dad.
I carry a gun.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.957
I know,

44:36.040 --> 44:38.191
but it's relative,
you know?

44:40.960 --> 44:44.192
There's the kind of things
a school teacher
gets exposed to,

44:44.280 --> 44:46.511
truancy and the like,

44:46.600 --> 44:49.320
and then there's
the stuff a cop sees,

44:49.400 --> 44:52.757
murder and violence,
and general scofflawery,

44:54.760 --> 44:56.956
and then there's
the kind of deal
you're looking at now.

44:58.960 --> 45:00.758
Which is?

45:00.840 --> 45:02.035
Which is

45:02.120 --> 45:03.634
if I'm right...

45:05.120 --> 45:08.113
savagery, pure and simple.

45:08.200 --> 45:10.396
Slaughter, hatred,

45:10.520 --> 45:13.115
devils with dead eyes
and shark smiles.

45:15.720 --> 45:19.396
One day, you're gonna
get married and have kids...

45:19.480 --> 45:20.880
and when you
look at them,

45:20.960 --> 45:23.600
their faces,

45:23.680 --> 45:26.639
you need to see
what's good in the world.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.473
'Cause if you don't,

45:28.560 --> 45:30.153
how you gonna live?

45:33.280 --> 45:34.714
You talk a lot,
you know that?

45:36.480 --> 45:38.597
It's always been
a problem.

45:44.560 --> 45:46.756
Lou.
Chief.

45:46.840 --> 45:48.797
Molly,
could I have a word?

45:48.880 --> 45:49.916
Yeah, sure.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.480
Pull up a chair.
You want some coffee or...

45:51.600 --> 45:53.319
Yeah, no, uh...

45:54.080 --> 45:57.232
Lester Nygaard
called me, yeah,
and he's super upset.

45:57.320 --> 45:58.993
Well, yeah, you know,
I thought
he might do that.

45:59.080 --> 46:00.799
Yeah, we talked
about this and all...

46:00.880 --> 46:02.314
and I thought we were...

46:02.400 --> 46:05.757
I thought I was clear
that we were gonna focus
on the drifter angle

46:05.840 --> 46:07.593
and not, you know,
harass the victim.

46:07.680 --> 46:09.990
Well, I'm not,
you know...

46:10.120 --> 46:12.112
I didn't harass him.
I just... I got questions,
you know.

46:12.200 --> 46:14.760
Yeah, well,
I'm the chief now,
and I got to...

46:16.000 --> 46:18.720
Everyone's gotta
line up behind me,
you know, toe the line.

46:18.800 --> 46:19.995
Sure, yeah,
yeah, I know...

46:20.080 --> 46:23.835
Yeah, we talked about this,
and now I gotta
take you off the case.

46:24.680 --> 46:26.080
Well, we all know
how you felt about Vern.

46:26.160 --> 46:27.116
I mean, heck,
who didn't?

46:27.200 --> 46:29.840
But, uh, maybe
it's best if you just...

46:31.360 --> 46:34.319
And this could
be good for you,
career-wise, because, uh...

46:34.400 --> 46:35.959
I'm gonna make
you head of inquiry

46:36.040 --> 46:38.430
on that, uh, frozen fella,
the naked one, yeah.

46:38.520 --> 46:39.636
I'll make you
lead on that.

46:39.720 --> 46:40.756
Bill, listen, I...

46:40.840 --> 46:42.877
Yeah, so
that's my decision.

46:43.720 --> 46:45.120
Take care.
What...

46:57.120 --> 46:58.236
Well, okay, then.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.794
See you for dinner.
Yep.

47:07.640 --> 47:10.280
Drills and needles.

47:24.800 --> 47:28.032
<i>To live in an old shack
by the sea</i>

47:35.960 --> 47:38.953
<i>To live with the dawn
and the dusk</i>

47:41.120 --> 47:45.194
<i>The new moon
and the full moon</i>

47:46.440 --> 47:52.277
<i>The tides
the wind and the rain</i>

47:53.520 --> 47:57.036
<i>To surf
and comb the beach</i>

47:57.960 --> 48:01.920
<i>And gather sea shells
and driftwood</i>

48:03.120 --> 48:05.510
<i>And know the thrill
of loneliness</i>

48:07.040 --> 48:09.635
<i>And lose all sense of time</i>

48:10.520 --> 48:12.113
<i>And be free</i>

48:15.040 --> 48:17.509
<i>To hike over the island
to the village</i>

48:19.440 --> 48:22.638
<i>And visit the market place</i>

48:22.800 --> 48:25.599
<i>And enjoy the music
and the food
and the people</i>

48:27.400 --> 48:28.720
<i>And do a little trading</i>

48:30.040 --> 48:32.032
<i>And see the great ships
come and go</i>

48:32.120 --> 48:34.430
No, wait.

48:34.520 --> 48:36.318
<i>And man, have me a ball</i>

48:38.760 --> 48:42.515
<i>And in the evening
when the sky is on fire</i>

48:43.600 --> 48:47.116
<i>Heaven and earth
become my great
open cathedral</i>

48:47.800 --> 48:49.996
<i>Where all men are brothers</i>

48:50.840 --> 48:53.992
<i>Where all things
are bound by law</i>

48:54.360 --> 48:56.511
<i>And crowned with love</i>
