WEBVTT

00:36.000 --> 00:41.100
In the first years
of the 21st century...

00:42.799 --> 00:46.599
...a third World War broke out.

00:47.699 --> 00:51.099
Those of us who survived knew

00:51.098 --> 00:57.598
mankind could never survive...

00:57.597 --> 01:00.197
a fourth...

01:00.298 --> 01:03.898
that our own volatile natures

01:03.997 --> 01:08.197
could simply no longer
be risked.

01:09.296 --> 01:13.296
So we have created
a new arm of the law...

01:14.896 --> 01:18.296
...the Grammaton Cleric,

01:18.395 --> 01:23.295
whose sole task it is
to seek out and eradicate

01:23.394 --> 01:28.694
the true source
of man's inhumanity to man.

01:31.294 --> 01:35.094
His ability...

01:35.193 --> 01:37.093
to feel.

01:38.293 --> 01:39.393
Police!

01:54.991 --> 01:56.391
You know what to do.

02:11.589 --> 02:12.689
Get down!

02:59.783 --> 03:01.383
We have an unknown number

03:01.483 --> 03:03.883
barricaded in the southeast end
of the compound.

03:03.983 --> 03:06.383
Read that.
Tetragrammaton team en route.

03:06.482 --> 03:10.482
Cleric, lights out.
Maybe more than a dozen inside.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.981
When the door's down,
blow the bulbs.

03:12.982 --> 03:14.782
Yes, sir.

03:18.981 --> 03:19.981
Go.

04:08.275 --> 04:09.375
Where is he?

04:09.475 --> 04:10.575
Shut up.

04:11.674 --> 04:13.674
Anybody get him?
Did anybody hit him?

04:13.675 --> 04:15.175
Shut up!

04:15.174 --> 04:16.674
Listen.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.260
This is it.

06:17.359 --> 06:18.559
Where?

06:20.160 --> 06:22.060
There.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.655
It's real.

07:08.854 --> 07:10.354
Burn it.

07:50.549 --> 07:51.949
Why didn't you just leave it

07:52.048 --> 07:55.148
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

07:59.848 --> 08:01.948
They miss things sometimes.

08:03.248 --> 08:07.048
And I thought
I'd take it down myself...

08:07.147 --> 08:08.647
get it done properly.

08:12.846 --> 08:17.346
How long, Preston,
till all this is gone?

08:18.945 --> 08:21.745
Till we've burned
every last bit of it?

08:23.144 --> 08:25.144
Resources are tight.

08:27.145 --> 08:29.245
We'll get it all eventually.

08:34.344 --> 08:37.044
Libria...

08:37.143 --> 08:40.443
I congratulate you.

08:40.543 --> 08:42.443
At last...

08:42.543 --> 08:47.243
peace reigns
in the heart of man.

08:47.342 --> 08:50.142
At last, war is but a word

08:50.141 --> 08:53.441
whose meaning fades
from our understanding.

08:53.541 --> 08:55.741
At last...

08:55.841 --> 09:00.041
we... are... whole.

09:07.540 --> 09:12.340
Librians... there is a disease
in the heart of man.

09:13.639 --> 09:15.939
Its symptom is hate.

09:17.138 --> 09:21.438
Its symptom... is anger.

09:21.438 --> 09:25.538
Its symptom is rage.

09:25.637 --> 09:30.537
Its symptom... is war.

09:30.636 --> 09:37.636
The disease... is human emotion.

09:37.736 --> 09:41.836
But, Libria...
I congratulate you.

09:41.936 --> 09:44.336
For there is a cure
for this disease.

09:44.335 --> 09:47.835
At the cost of the dizzying
highs of human emotion,

09:47.835 --> 09:52.035
we have suppressed
its abysmal lows.

09:52.034 --> 09:57.634
And you as a society
have embraced this cure.

09:59.033 --> 09:59.933
Prozium.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.733
Now we are at peace
with ourselves,

10:04.833 --> 10:08.233
and humankind is one.

10:08.332 --> 10:10.232
War is gone.

10:10.332 --> 10:12.932
Hate, a memory.

10:13.032 --> 10:15.932
We are our own conscience now.

10:16.032 --> 10:21.432
And it is this conscience
that guides us to rate EC-10

10:21.531 --> 10:23.731
for emotional content

10:23.830 --> 10:28.030
all those things that might
tempt us to feel again...

10:28.030 --> 10:29.730
and destroy them.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.730
Librians, you have won.

10:32.830 --> 10:37.730
Against all odds
and your own natures...

10:37.729 --> 10:42.129
you have survived.

11:02.826 --> 11:05.326
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

11:05.425 --> 11:08.925
it reminds why we do
what we do.

11:09.025 --> 11:10.125
It does?

11:12.225 --> 11:14.025
I beg your pardon.

11:19.224 --> 11:20.324
<i>It does.</i>

11:33.322 --> 11:36.622
The following items
have been rated EC-10...

11:36.722 --> 11:38.122
condemned...

11:38.122 --> 11:41.022
seven works of two-dimensional
illustrated material,

11:41.121 --> 11:43.721
seven discs of musical content,

11:43.721 --> 11:46.821
20 interactive strategy
computer programs.

11:46.820 --> 11:49.820
Seven works
of two-dimensional...

11:54.920 --> 11:57.220
Thank you
for coming, Cleric.

11:57.319 --> 11:59.219
I assume you know who I am.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.519
Yes, sir. Of course.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.219
You are Vice-Council Dupont

12:02.319 --> 12:04.519
of the Third Conciliarly
of the Tetragrammaton...

12:04.618 --> 12:06.018
Father's voice.

12:06.119 --> 12:07.819
Quite frankly, Cleric,

12:07.818 --> 12:12.618
I am told that you are
very nearly a prodigal student,

12:12.618 --> 12:16.518
knowing almost instantly
if someone is feeling.

12:16.617 --> 12:18.417
I have a good record, sir.

12:18.417 --> 12:21.217
Why, do you imagine,
that is, Cleric?

12:21.216 --> 12:23.716
I'm not sure, Vice-Council.

12:25.117 --> 12:27.917
Somehow...

12:28.016 --> 12:30.516
I'm able, on some level,

12:30.615 --> 12:34.115
to sense
how an offender thinks,

12:34.215 --> 12:38.115
to... put myself
in their position.

12:39.315 --> 12:43.415
If you had ceased
your interval,

12:43.414 --> 12:46.914
if you were
a sense offender...

12:47.014 --> 12:49.114
I suppose
you could say that, sir.

12:49.113 --> 12:51.513
You're a family man, Cleric?

12:51.513 --> 12:53.213
Yes, sir...
a boy and a girl.

12:53.312 --> 12:55.312
The boy's in
the monastery himself,

12:55.313 --> 12:56.813
on path to becoming a Cleric.

12:56.812 --> 12:57.912
Good.

12:58.012 --> 12:59.212
And the mother?

12:59.312 --> 13:01.112
My spouse was arrested
and incinerated

13:01.212 --> 13:02.912
for sense offense
four years ago, sir.

13:03.012 --> 13:04.012
By yourself?

13:04.011 --> 13:05.211
No, sir... by another.

13:07.011 --> 13:09.511
How did you feel about that?

13:12.010 --> 13:13.610
I'm sorry.

13:13.711 --> 13:15.811
I don't...
fully understand, sir.

13:17.210 --> 13:18.810
How did you feel?

13:20.910 --> 13:23.410
I didn't feel anything.

13:23.509 --> 13:25.309
Really?

13:25.309 --> 13:27.709
How is it
that you came to miss it?

13:32.908 --> 13:34.708
I...

13:37.708 --> 13:40.108
I've asked myself
that same question, sir.

13:40.207 --> 13:41.707
I don't know.

13:43.307 --> 13:46.607
A nearly unforgivable lapse,
Cleric.

13:48.307 --> 13:53.007
I trust you'll be
more vigilant in the future.

13:54.705 --> 13:56.405
Yes, sir.

14:00.705 --> 14:03.405
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

14:03.505 --> 14:06.205
it reminds why we do
what we do.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.304
It does?

14:09.004 --> 14:11.004
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

14:11.104 --> 14:14.404
it reminds why we do
what we do.

14:14.403 --> 14:15.403
It does?

14:17.502 --> 14:19.502
<i>It does.</i>

14:22.503 --> 14:26.703
Prosecutorial evidence
for A.N.R. 136890.

14:26.801 --> 14:28.401
I need it.

14:28.502 --> 14:30.402
It was late this afternoon.

14:30.501 --> 14:32.701
May not have showed up
in the records yet.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.400
I'm very sorry, Cleric.

14:35.501 --> 14:36.901
Nothing has been logged

14:37.001 --> 14:39.401
and nothing is pending
under that entry.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.600
It was an item of evidence
brought in personally

14:41.700 --> 14:42.900
by Grammaton Errol Partridge.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.200
Check again.

14:44.300 --> 14:48.600
Sir, Cleric Partridge has not
entered anything in for weeks.

14:48.699 --> 14:51.699
You're mistaken.
It was a book of some kind.

14:51.798 --> 14:52.798
Cleric...

14:55.298 --> 14:56.598
...there's nothing.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.798
Thank you.

15:03.998 --> 15:06.098
He's been passing through
the gate into the Nether

15:06.198 --> 15:07.598
every night
for the last two weeks.

15:07.697 --> 15:09.197
We assumed it was
enforcement-related.

15:52.892 --> 15:55.092
You always knew.

16:04.890 --> 16:07.590
"But I, being poor...

16:07.690 --> 16:09.990
have only my dreams."

16:10.090 --> 16:14.390
"I have spread my dreams
under your feet.

16:14.489 --> 16:17.689
"Tread softly...

16:17.789 --> 16:21.089
because you tread
on my dreams."

16:22.888 --> 16:25.288
I assume you dream, Preston.

16:26.788 --> 16:29.388
I'll do what I can
to see they go easy on you.

16:31.487 --> 16:36.387
We both know...
they never go easy.

16:36.387 --> 16:37.587
Then I'm sorry.

16:37.687 --> 16:39.687
No, you're not.

16:39.687 --> 16:42.887
You don't even know
the meaning.

16:42.886 --> 16:45.586
It's just a... vestigial word

16:45.585 --> 16:47.485
for a feeling
you've never felt.

16:49.885 --> 16:52.285
Don't you see, Preston?

16:52.384 --> 16:54.484
It's gone.

16:54.584 --> 16:57.784
Everything that makes us
what we are... traded away.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.984
There's no war.

17:01.484 --> 17:02.784
No murder.

17:04.283 --> 17:06.083
What is it you think we do?

17:06.083 --> 17:07.983
No.

17:07.982 --> 17:09.282
You've been with me.

17:09.383 --> 17:12.783
You've seen how it can be...
the jealousy, the rage.

17:14.882 --> 17:16.882
A heavy cost.

17:19.281 --> 17:21.481
I'd pay it gladly.

17:45.378 --> 17:46.378
Don't.

18:28.874 --> 18:32.074
You and your partner
were close?

18:38.173 --> 18:40.173
I hope you're as pleased
to be assigned me

18:40.272 --> 18:42.172
as I am the placement.

18:43.571 --> 18:47.071
I was told this would be
a career-making advancement.

18:51.070 --> 18:55.070
I'm like you, Cleric...
intuitive.

18:56.370 --> 18:58.470
Sometimes I know
when a person's feeling

18:58.570 --> 19:00.370
before they know it
themselves.

19:10.868 --> 19:12.868
Cleric...

19:14.068 --> 19:16.668
I can only hope one day
to be as...

19:16.767 --> 19:20.767
uncompromising as you.

19:20.867 --> 19:22.167
Good night.

19:24.867 --> 19:26.967
The later 20th century

19:27.067 --> 19:30.167
saw the fortuitous
and simultaneous rise

19:30.266 --> 19:35.366
of two synergistic political
and psychological sciences.

19:35.366 --> 19:39.466
The first, the revolutionary
precept of the hate crime.

19:42.064 --> 19:43.164
John?

19:43.264 --> 19:44.264
Yes?

19:44.364 --> 19:47.464
I saw Robbie Taylor
crying today.

19:47.564 --> 19:51.264
He didn't know, but I saw.

19:51.363 --> 19:53.663
Do you think
I should report him?

19:59.462 --> 20:01.262
Unquestionably.

20:07.362 --> 20:10.162
...a single inescapable fact...

20:10.261 --> 20:13.261
that mankind united with
infinitely greater purpose

20:13.361 --> 20:15.961
in pursuit of war...

20:16.160 --> 20:19.960
than he ever did
in pursuit of peace.

20:28.159 --> 20:31.259
"But I, being poor...

20:31.359 --> 20:34.059
have only my dreams."

20:34.158 --> 20:37.458
I have spread my dreams
under your feet."

20:39.058 --> 20:41.358
"Tread softly...

20:41.358 --> 20:44.258
because you tread
on my dreams."

21:27.553 --> 21:29.253
Don't move! Don't move!

21:29.352 --> 21:30.952
Comply! Comply!

21:31.051 --> 21:32.951
- Stop! Stop where you are!
- Get down! Get down!

21:37.051 --> 21:39.651
Don't shoot.
This is a lawful entry.

21:39.751 --> 21:41.251
We have a warrant
for your wife's arrest.

21:41.250 --> 21:43.150
She's charged
with sense offense.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.349
Hey!

21:57.449 --> 22:00.249
Get her!
Get her off him now!

22:01.448 --> 22:02.748
Remember me.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.347
Libria...

22:18.346 --> 22:20.146
Awake.

22:20.246 --> 22:25.446
Awaken to triumph again
in the face of yet another day,

22:25.445 --> 22:29.045
another step
in our unified march

22:29.145 --> 22:32.745
into the unwavering purpose...

22:36.744 --> 22:39.444
...move ahead together

22:39.543 --> 22:43.143
into the certainty
of our collective destiny.

23:03.641 --> 23:05.541
What are you doing?

23:08.840 --> 23:11.140
I said, what are you doing?

23:11.140 --> 23:14.640
I accidentally dropped my...

23:14.739 --> 23:16.239
morning interval.

23:16.339 --> 23:19.339
I took it out
before I brushed my teeth.

23:20.539 --> 23:22.939
I never take it out
before I brush my teeth.

23:22.939 --> 23:26.839
Then you'll go by Equilibrium,
log the loss,

23:26.938 --> 23:28.238
and get a replacement.

23:29.838 --> 23:31.238
Yes.

23:31.337 --> 23:33.137
Of course.

23:53.835 --> 23:56.035
Your new partner called.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.535
He says he'll pick you up
at 10:00 for the A.N.R.

23:58.534 --> 23:59.934
I hope you don't mind.

23:59.934 --> 24:02.334
I took the liberty
of telling him

24:02.334 --> 24:05.434
you would be at Equilibrium,
replacing your dose.

24:06.534 --> 24:08.034
No, of course not.

24:08.133 --> 24:10.133
That was the right thing
to do.

24:13.132 --> 24:15.432
Stop that.

24:22.531 --> 24:25.331
Due to terrorist activity,

24:25.431 --> 24:27.831
this site is
temporarily closed.

24:27.931 --> 24:33.331
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.

24:34.530 --> 24:36.830
Due to terrorist activity,

24:36.829 --> 24:39.129
this site is
temporarily closed.

24:39.229 --> 24:41.729

24:41.729 --> 24:46.229
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.

24:51.228 --> 24:53.028
More than punctual, Cleric.

24:53.028 --> 24:54.228
Hop in.

25:07.226 --> 25:08.926
How were the lines?

25:09.025 --> 25:11.425
I'm surprised you were able
to get your interval

25:11.526 --> 25:13.226
and get out so quickly.

25:14.525 --> 25:16.525
No, they're...
they're fine today.

25:20.524 --> 25:23.724
Maybe I'll drop by later,
get my interval adjusted.

25:25.324 --> 25:27.524
You expecting Resistance?

25:27.524 --> 25:30.724
That's something you'll find
about me, Cleric.

25:30.823 --> 25:34.823
I'm a wary person,
cautious by nature.

25:36.222 --> 25:38.522
Always expecting the worst.

25:40.922 --> 25:42.222
You can't do this.
You cannot do this.

25:42.322 --> 25:45.422
Tetragrammaton.
There's nothing we can't do.

25:46.721 --> 25:48.621
How long have you been off
the dose?

25:48.721 --> 25:49.721
Look at you.

25:51.021 --> 25:52.521
Look at you!

25:59.620 --> 26:00.720
Look at you.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.520
The mirror's frame is illegal.
Destroy it.

26:14.419 --> 26:17.219
We have suppression.
We're making entry.

26:17.318 --> 26:18.718
Standard deployment.

26:18.817 --> 26:21.617
Collecting catalog.
Illegal articles.

27:07.612 --> 27:09.412
You're gonna burn it,
aren't you?

27:10.711 --> 27:12.111
Eventually.

27:12.211 --> 27:14.911
However, you couldn't have
accumulated all this

27:15.011 --> 27:16.211
by yourself.

27:16.311 --> 27:19.311
It'll all be sorted
and examined.

27:19.411 --> 27:22.511
We'll discover
who your confederates are.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.210
Gun!

27:42.907 --> 27:44.607
We need her.

28:10.804 --> 28:11.804
What's your name?

28:11.904 --> 28:15.104
O'Brien, Mary.

28:15.104 --> 28:18.404
Well, Mary...

28:18.403 --> 28:19.803
you can either wait

28:19.904 --> 28:24.004
and tell the technicians
at the Palace of Justice...

28:24.103 --> 28:26.803
or you can tell me now.

28:26.903 --> 28:28.903
Who are your friends?

28:32.602 --> 28:35.102
I'm wondering if you have
any idea at all

28:35.202 --> 28:38.202
what that word means...
"friend."

28:41.601 --> 28:43.801
There's nothing
you don't feel?

28:45.500 --> 28:47.000
How about guilt?

28:48.800 --> 28:51.000
Let me ask you something.

28:59.798 --> 29:02.498
Why are you alive?

29:05.798 --> 29:08.298
I'm alive...

29:12.597 --> 29:13.997
I live...

29:16.496 --> 29:19.896
...to safeguard the continuity
of this great society.

29:19.996 --> 29:21.596
To serve Libria.

29:21.696 --> 29:23.096
It's circular.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.796
You exist to continue
your existence.

29:25.795 --> 29:27.295
What's the point?

29:29.495 --> 29:31.295
<i>What's the point
of your existence?</i>

29:31.295 --> 29:32.895
To feel.

29:32.894 --> 29:36.094
'Cause you've never done it,
you can never know it.

29:36.194 --> 29:38.894
But it's as vital as breath.

29:38.994 --> 29:41.594
And without it...
without love,

29:41.694 --> 29:45.194
without anger,
without sorrow...

29:45.294 --> 29:49.694
breath is
just a clock ticking.

29:53.892 --> 29:56.692
Then I have no choice
but to remand you

29:56.792 --> 29:58.992
to the Palace of Justice
for processing.

30:00.592 --> 30:02.392
Processing.

30:05.591 --> 30:07.691
You mean execution, don't you?

30:10.091 --> 30:11.791
Processing.

30:19.789 --> 30:21.689
The Gun Katas.

30:21.789 --> 30:24.689
Through analysis of thousands
of recorded gunfights,

30:24.789 --> 30:26.689
the Cleric has determined

30:26.689 --> 30:29.889
that the geometric distribution
of antagonists in any gun battle

30:29.988 --> 30:32.688
is a statistically
predictable element.

30:32.688 --> 30:36.188
The Gun Kata treats
the gun as a total weapon,

30:36.188 --> 30:38.488
each fluid position
representing

30:38.587 --> 30:41.587
a maximum kill zone,
inflicting maximum damage

30:41.686 --> 30:43.486
on the maximum number
of opponents

30:43.586 --> 30:45.286
while keeping
the defender clear

30:45.386 --> 30:47.686
of the statistically
traditional trajectories

30:47.785 --> 30:49.385
of return fire.

30:50.586 --> 30:52.486
By the rote mastery
of this art,

30:52.586 --> 30:55.786
your firing efficiency will rise
by no less than 120%.

30:55.885 --> 30:59.485
The difference of a 63% increase
to lethal proficiency

30:59.484 --> 31:01.884
makes the master
of the Gun Katas

31:01.984 --> 31:05.884
an adversary not to be
taken lightly.

31:56.278 --> 31:58.978
Without love...

31:59.078 --> 32:02.678
breath is just a clock...
ticking.

33:43.965 --> 33:47.965
Prozium...
the great nepenthe.

33:47.965 --> 33:50.165
Opiate of our masses.

33:50.264 --> 33:52.864
Glue of our great society.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.064
Salve and salvation,

33:55.064 --> 33:59.064
it has delivered us
from pathos, from sorrow,

33:59.063 --> 34:03.163
the deepest chasms
of melancholy and hate.

34:03.262 --> 34:05.762
With it, we anesthetize grief,

34:05.863 --> 34:09.963
annihilate jealousy,
obliterate rage.

34:10.062 --> 34:14.462
That those sister impulses
towards joy, love, and elation

34:14.561 --> 34:17.061
are anesthetized in stride,

34:17.161 --> 34:19.461
we accept as fair sacrifice.

34:19.561 --> 34:25.461
For we embrace Prozium
in its unifying fullness

34:25.560 --> 34:29.760
and all that it has done
to make us great.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.254
Good morning, Cleric.

35:24.253 --> 35:26.253
Good morning.

35:26.253 --> 35:30.353
...intrinsically, humans,
as creatures of the Earth

35:30.452 --> 35:36.652
were drawn inherently always
back to one thing... war.

35:36.751 --> 35:40.051
And thus we seek to correct
not the symptom

35:40.051 --> 35:42.651
but the disease itself.

35:42.751 --> 35:46.151
We have sought to shrug off
individuality,

35:46.250 --> 35:48.850
replacing it with conformity.

35:48.951 --> 35:51.851
Replacing it...

35:51.950 --> 35:54.650
with sameness...

35:54.750 --> 35:57.250
with unity,

35:57.350 --> 36:01.850
allowing each man, woman,
and child

36:01.949 --> 36:03.749
in this great society

36:03.848 --> 36:07.448
to lead identical lives.

36:08.948 --> 36:12.448
The concept of identical
environment construction

36:12.548 --> 36:15.748
allows each of us to head
confidently into each moment

36:15.847 --> 36:17.547
with all the secure knowledge

36:17.647 --> 36:20.447
it has been lived before.

36:35.345 --> 36:36.945
What are you doing?

36:40.744 --> 36:42.744
I'm rearranging my desk.

36:42.844 --> 36:45.444
You didn't like
the way it was before?

36:47.144 --> 36:48.644
I had no feelings about it.

36:48.743 --> 36:50.943
I'm merely attempting
to optimize.

36:54.043 --> 36:57.843
Sense offenders
holed up in the Nether.

37:12.141 --> 37:14.941
We estimate...
we estimate 50 men, sir.

37:15.040 --> 37:18.640
Intelligence tells us
they're all fully armed.

37:18.639 --> 37:22.339
This is the group that bombed
the Prozium factories.

37:22.340 --> 37:23.940
You clean, we'll sweep.

37:23.939 --> 37:25.539
Yes, sir.

37:28.539 --> 37:30.439
Go! Go! Go! Go!

37:30.438 --> 37:31.438
Go!

37:31.438 --> 37:33.038
Aah!

37:33.138 --> 37:35.538
Take it! Take the landings!

37:36.738 --> 37:37.738
- Aah!
- Aah!

37:49.236 --> 37:51.336
- Cover me. I'm going in.
- Aaaaaaaah!

37:55.235 --> 37:56.735
Nice grab, Cleric.

40:26.517 --> 40:30.417
"Ludwig Van Beethoven."

42:29.103 --> 42:30.203
Cleric...

42:31.302 --> 42:32.702
Why didn't you leave that

42:32.803 --> 42:35.603
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

42:41.701 --> 42:43.201
They miss things sometimes.

42:43.201 --> 42:46.401
I'll take it in myself...

42:46.401 --> 42:49.201
make sure
it gets done properly.

42:52.300 --> 42:54.300
You know, Preston...

42:56.100 --> 42:58.200
If we keep burning
all this contraband,

42:58.299 --> 43:00.499
eventually there won't be
anything left to burn.

43:00.599 --> 43:04.399
What'll there be
for men like us?

43:04.498 --> 43:06.198
Sir!

43:06.299 --> 43:07.799
We got something out back.

43:17.397 --> 43:19.697
We're gonna need
two more men on this.

43:25.197 --> 43:27.497
These animals were defended
by women and children.

43:27.596 --> 43:28.896
We put them down easily.

43:28.896 --> 43:32.596
This isn't the first time
we've seen this.

43:32.595 --> 43:34.895
Why do they keep
these animals?

43:34.995 --> 43:37.095
What, do they...
do they eat them?

43:39.095 --> 43:41.195
What do you want me
to do, sir?

43:41.294 --> 43:42.594
Exterminate them, of course.

43:42.695 --> 43:44.095
All right. Let's do it.

43:44.194 --> 43:45.994
No.

43:45.994 --> 43:47.194
What's wrong, Cleric?

43:50.793 --> 43:52.993
Nothing.

44:05.991 --> 44:07.491
Hey...

44:07.592 --> 44:08.792
Grab it.

44:08.891 --> 44:09.991
Grab it!

44:17.690 --> 44:19.890
Sir... toss it back in.

44:19.990 --> 44:21.790
I'll finish it off.

44:26.689 --> 44:27.789
Give it to me, sir.

44:27.789 --> 44:29.789
Give it to him, Cleric.
He'll finish it.

44:43.787 --> 44:44.987
Wait!

44:47.987 --> 44:50.587
It seems to me that...

44:50.686 --> 44:54.286
at least some of these animals
ought to be tested for disease.

44:54.386 --> 44:56.386
If there's an epidemic
in the Nether,

44:56.486 --> 44:58.986
it's best we know about it.

45:01.985 --> 45:05.685
I don't quite follow
your logic, Cleric.

45:05.785 --> 45:07.085
They were Resistance.

45:07.084 --> 45:09.384
They could have led us
to the Underground.

45:09.384 --> 45:11.084
But instead of apprehension
and interrogation,

45:11.184 --> 45:12.084
they were slaughtered.

45:12.184 --> 45:15.384
Yes, but, Cleric,
given the circumstances,

45:15.483 --> 45:16.983
the Father has decreed

45:17.083 --> 45:20.483
that there will be no more
"process" for sense offenders.

45:20.582 --> 45:22.982
They are either to be
shot on sight

45:23.082 --> 45:24.482
or incinerated without a trial.

45:24.583 --> 45:25.783
But it's counter to law.

45:25.782 --> 45:27.682
You're a member
of the Council. If...

45:27.682 --> 45:29.582
It is not the will
of the Council,

45:29.682 --> 45:32.382
it is the will of Father...
and he is law.

45:34.082 --> 45:36.582
Sir...

45:36.581 --> 45:39.581
without the logic of process,
is it not just mayhem...

45:39.580 --> 45:42.580
what we have worked so hard
to eradicate?

45:42.680 --> 45:44.780
You must understand, Preston,

45:44.880 --> 45:48.480
that while you... and even I...
may not always agree with it,

45:48.580 --> 45:51.280
it is not the message
that is important,

45:51.379 --> 45:54.579
it is our obedience to it.

45:54.679 --> 45:56.779
Father's will.

45:56.879 --> 45:59.479
Call it faith.

45:59.478 --> 46:01.578
You have it, I assume?

46:06.178 --> 46:07.478
Yes.

46:08.977 --> 46:10.577
I have it.

46:10.576 --> 46:12.176
Good.

46:33.574 --> 46:36.874
Confiscated evidence
X23-T45...

46:36.974 --> 46:39.274
Mary O'Brien.

47:41.466 --> 47:43.566
Cleric John Preston
passing into the Nether...

47:43.566 --> 47:45.766
enforcement-related.

47:48.765 --> 47:49.965
Thank you, sir.

48:21.961 --> 48:24.561
I don't know what else
to do with you.

48:27.461 --> 48:28.661
Go on.

48:28.760 --> 48:29.760
Go on.

48:32.360 --> 48:34.160
Go!

49:09.656 --> 49:10.756
Fine.

49:10.856 --> 49:12.856
But you're going back
in the trunk.

49:26.754 --> 49:28.254
Okay.

49:31.553 --> 49:32.853
Here.

49:44.252 --> 49:46.152
Step away from the vehicle!

49:46.151 --> 49:48.451
Step away from the vehicle!

49:48.451 --> 49:49.751
This is your last warning!

49:49.851 --> 49:52.651
Step away from the vehicle!

49:52.751 --> 49:54.951
Identification.

49:55.050 --> 49:56.450
I'm a Cleric.

49:56.550 --> 49:58.750
I'm here on official business.

49:58.750 --> 49:59.550
Identification!

50:00.850 --> 50:01.950
It's in my coat.

50:02.050 --> 50:04.250
Where's the coat?
Where is it?!

50:05.549 --> 50:07.549
I don't have it.

50:07.649 --> 50:10.349
Unidentified individuals are
subject to summary destruction.

50:10.449 --> 50:12.149
You're making
a very big mistake.

50:12.148 --> 50:13.248
I'm a Grammaton Cleric,
first class.

50:13.348 --> 50:14.348
We're gonna search
your vehicle.

50:14.448 --> 50:16.648
No, you're not.
There's nothing in it.

50:16.747 --> 50:18.247
Search it!

50:25.046 --> 50:27.046
- Clear, sir.
- Keys to the trunk.

50:27.047 --> 50:28.347
I'm trying to tell you.

50:28.446 --> 50:30.446
I have a predawn combustion
to witness.

50:30.546 --> 50:31.946
I'm not...

50:32.046 --> 50:34.046
Captain, this is a waste
of my time.

50:34.046 --> 50:35.446
My name is John Preston.

50:35.445 --> 50:37.845
I'm the highest-ranking Cleric
of the Tetragramm...

50:37.845 --> 50:39.445
Wait.

50:43.044 --> 50:44.144
Stand off.

50:46.944 --> 50:49.344
I'm sorry
I didn't recognize you, sir.

50:51.644 --> 50:53.944
That's okay.
Just doing your job.

50:53.944 --> 50:54.944
Thank you.

50:56.243 --> 50:57.943
We'll escort you back
to the gate.

50:57.943 --> 50:58.943
Thanks.

51:06.142 --> 51:07.342
Animals.

51:08.741 --> 51:10.241
Nether's full of them.

51:10.341 --> 51:12.241
Sounds like it came
from your trunk.

51:12.241 --> 51:14.241
Impossible.

51:14.241 --> 51:16.241
Just give me my keys.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.440
I'll be on my way.

51:23.140 --> 51:24.340
Captain...

51:24.439 --> 51:27.539
I'm asking you
one last time...

51:27.639 --> 51:29.439
don't do this.

51:30.939 --> 51:32.239
Down on your knees!

51:32.339 --> 51:33.939
- Down on your knees!
- Down on your knees!

51:33.938 --> 51:35.138
Drop down!

51:35.239 --> 51:37.539
On the ground! Comply!

51:37.538 --> 51:39.138
Do it!

51:39.937 --> 51:41.037
No.

51:41.037 --> 51:42.437
Fuck!

51:46.837 --> 51:48.137
What?

51:48.236 --> 51:50.536
Aw, shit! Shoot him!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

51:59.835 --> 52:01.035
Aah!

54:19.419 --> 54:21.919
Always practicing, Cleric.

54:22.018 --> 54:24.618
I guess that's why
you're the best.

54:27.718 --> 54:29.318
Maybe I'm just better.

54:30.417 --> 54:32.217
Something on your mind?

54:34.917 --> 54:36.217
Why do you ask?

54:36.317 --> 54:37.517
The intuitive arts, Cleric.

54:37.616 --> 54:39.716
It's my job to know
what you're thinking.

54:51.115 --> 54:53.815
So, then...
what am I thinking?

54:58.714 --> 55:01.814
About the murders
in the Nether last night...

55:08.113 --> 55:09.913
And if they know who did it.

55:15.713 --> 55:16.713
Am I close?

55:19.612 --> 55:22.112
So, tell me... do they know?

55:30.710 --> 55:32.610
There are theories.

55:32.710 --> 55:35.010
I have one or two of my own,
but at the moment...

55:35.010 --> 55:37.210
They're premature!

55:42.009 --> 55:43.409
I'm glad it happened.

55:48.208 --> 55:48.808
Why?

55:48.909 --> 55:50.909
Because now
Father and the Council

55:51.008 --> 55:54.508
have decreed an acceleration
in the crackdown on offenders.

55:54.607 --> 55:56.807
Whoever did it...

55:56.907 --> 56:00.307
all they accomplished was
a quicker end to the Resistance.

56:09.706 --> 56:11.506
It's gonna be
a massacre, Cleric.

56:28.204 --> 56:31.404
I came to tell you...
there's a raid in the Nether...

56:31.504 --> 56:34.504
Sector 7.

56:36.102 --> 56:38.202
So get ready.

57:19.498 --> 57:20.898
That door behind you...

57:22.997 --> 57:24.297
Go.

57:25.997 --> 57:27.297
Go, damn you!

57:31.797 --> 57:33.397
Get out of here, God damn it!
If you don't, you're dead!

57:33.496 --> 57:35.296
Don't do it.
He'll shoot us in the back.

57:35.396 --> 57:37.396
If I was gonna shoot you,
I'd shoot you in the face.

57:37.395 --> 57:38.795
Now go.

57:44.995 --> 57:46.795
Damn you! Follow me.

57:46.894 --> 57:49.594
Now! Let's go!

57:58.593 --> 58:00.193
There will be no detention.

58:00.192 --> 58:03.992
Repeat...
no detention for any purpose.

58:04.093 --> 58:07.893
All prisoners and apprehendees
are to be put down.

58:15.491 --> 58:17.591
Look out!

58:20.391 --> 58:22.091
Aah!

58:24.190 --> 58:25.590
Aaaah!

58:30.090 --> 58:32.390
Cleric, what's happening?
We heard gunshots.

58:33.989 --> 58:34.989
Go!

58:35.089 --> 58:37.289
What are you doing?
Cleric!

58:37.389 --> 58:38.589
They're Resistance fighters.

58:39.688 --> 58:40.588
Cleric!

58:43.488 --> 58:44.688
He's a sense offender!

59:28.782 --> 59:30.082
Cover all quadrants!

59:30.182 --> 59:31.482
Secure the perimeter!

59:42.681 --> 59:44.181
What is this?

59:45.280 --> 59:47.080
What are you doing?!

59:47.181 --> 59:49.681
Nicely done, Cleric.

59:49.780 --> 59:51.880
You drive them
into the trap...

59:53.879 --> 59:55.079
I close it.

1:00:01.279 --> 1:00:06.279
The very definition
of... teamwork.

1:00:06.278 --> 1:00:07.878
Don't you think?

1:00:10.277 --> 1:00:13.477
Why don't you take the honors
of the execution, Cleric?

1:00:17.177 --> 1:00:20.377
These people should be taken
for clinical interrogation.

1:00:20.476 --> 1:00:21.576
Cleric...

1:00:21.676 --> 1:00:23.976
Father's rulings
are quite clear.

1:00:24.076 --> 1:00:26.776
Offenders are to be shot
on sight.

1:00:26.875 --> 1:00:28.475
They have valuable information.

1:00:28.476 --> 1:00:29.576
Cleric...

1:00:29.576 --> 1:00:31.076
They can be put to
much better use.

1:00:31.175 --> 1:00:32.175
Cleric.

1:00:33.475 --> 1:00:37.275
If your weapon's low,
please, use mine.

1:01:26.469 --> 1:01:27.169
No.

1:01:30.468 --> 1:01:32.968
I think, in the end...

1:01:33.068 --> 1:01:35.168
<i>it'll be better
if you have it.</i>

1:01:57.365 --> 1:01:58.365
Captain.

1:01:58.465 --> 1:02:00.365
Yes, sir. Firing positions.

1:02:04.664 --> 1:02:05.964
Ready...

1:02:14.762 --> 1:02:15.762
Aim...

1:02:22.462 --> 1:02:24.262
Fire!

1:02:31.061 --> 1:02:32.761
Sir?

1:02:32.861 --> 1:02:34.761
Yes, Cleric?

1:02:34.760 --> 1:02:37.560
You asked me to become
Father's instrument

1:02:37.660 --> 1:02:40.360
against the Resistance.

1:02:40.460 --> 1:02:42.360
I'm ready.

1:02:42.460 --> 1:02:44.360
Today.

1:02:44.459 --> 1:02:46.259
I wish to show my faith.

1:02:48.359 --> 1:02:50.159
I wish, with your permission,

1:02:50.258 --> 1:02:53.158
to locate the Underground
once and for all.

1:02:53.258 --> 1:02:54.658
To destroy it.

1:02:57.457 --> 1:02:59.057
To destroy it.

1:02:59.158 --> 1:03:01.258
Good. Do it.

1:03:10.657 --> 1:03:13.657
I'm so...

1:03:13.756 --> 1:03:15.456
so very sorry.

1:03:27.154 --> 1:03:30.454
These are the possessions he had
on him at the time of death.

1:03:30.454 --> 1:03:31.854
The illegal ones
will be burned with him.

1:03:31.954 --> 1:03:33.254
Good.

1:04:14.849 --> 1:04:16.149
Errol Partridge.

1:04:20.148 --> 1:04:22.448
The name supposed to mean
something to me?

1:04:22.548 --> 1:04:25.248
He was a Grammaton Cleric,
first class. You knew him.

1:04:25.348 --> 1:04:28.648
News bulletin...
I'm a sense offender.

1:04:28.647 --> 1:04:30.847
I don't hang around much
with the Cleric.

1:04:37.546 --> 1:04:39.646
I want to know about him.

1:04:42.945 --> 1:04:44.145
Well...

1:04:44.246 --> 1:04:47.346
I suggest you go ask him.

1:04:48.445 --> 1:04:51.445
But I understand
that he's dead...

1:04:51.445 --> 1:04:55.145
killed by your friends
at the Tetragrammaton.

1:04:55.144 --> 1:04:57.844
Not by my friends.

1:04:57.943 --> 1:04:59.643
<i>By me.</i>

1:05:08.442 --> 1:05:09.942
Aaah!

1:05:44.138 --> 1:05:45.638
You were lovers.

1:06:03.836 --> 1:06:06.336
The Underground is our foe,

1:06:06.436 --> 1:06:09.036
and greater
than even the threat

1:06:09.035 --> 1:06:12.935
of those who have forsaken
their Prozium for emotion

1:06:13.035 --> 1:06:18.135
is the threat of those
selfsame individuals united.

1:06:18.134 --> 1:06:20.934
They are
the secret organization...

1:06:26.533 --> 1:06:29.433
And thus, it is in the writing
of the Father

1:06:29.532 --> 1:06:31.232
that we find our greatest...

1:06:33.132 --> 1:06:35.032
Good afternoon, sir.

1:06:35.032 --> 1:06:37.932
What will it be for you?

1:06:38.032 --> 1:06:39.732
The latest copy
of the inserts?

1:06:39.831 --> 1:06:42.031
Revised edition
of the manifesto?

1:06:42.031 --> 1:06:43.131
Errol Partridge.

1:06:43.131 --> 1:06:45.731
What do you know about him?

1:06:45.831 --> 1:06:47.131
I beg your pardon?

1:06:47.230 --> 1:06:49.030
Everyone out. Now.

1:07:02.929 --> 1:07:04.829
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

1:07:04.928 --> 1:07:07.528
Errol Partridge...
what do you know about him?

1:07:07.629 --> 1:07:10.529
I'm sure this must be
some mis...

1:07:10.528 --> 1:07:12.828
- You're an offender.
- I'm not.

1:07:12.928 --> 1:07:15.728
No? Then why are you
so scared of me?

1:07:15.828 --> 1:07:18.928
Now, you will tell me everything
you know about Errol Partridge,

1:07:18.927 --> 1:07:20.927
or I will have a wagon
come to take you

1:07:20.927 --> 1:07:23.827
to the Hall of Destruction
for summary combustion.

1:07:23.826 --> 1:07:26.026
I-I really don't know...

1:07:26.026 --> 1:07:27.126
Speak!

1:07:27.226 --> 1:07:30.826
He... he'd come in here
with a fellow named Jurgen.

1:07:30.925 --> 1:07:32.125
Why?

1:07:32.225 --> 1:07:35.325
That's... that's all I know.
I swear.

1:07:35.425 --> 1:07:36.425
Jurgen!

1:07:57.122 --> 1:07:58.922
Interesting.

1:08:00.722 --> 1:08:02.122
- Ugh-ow!
- Ugh!

1:08:37.018 --> 1:08:40.018
We've been watching you,
Preston.

1:08:46.217 --> 1:08:47.517
You're Jurgen.

1:08:49.116 --> 1:08:51.916
You're feeling.

1:09:06.215 --> 1:09:08.315
Do you know why you came?

1:09:31.012 --> 1:09:33.612
Welcome to the Underground.

1:09:44.110 --> 1:09:45.610
Polygraph.

1:09:45.710 --> 1:09:49.710
It detects fluctuations
of human emotion.

1:09:49.709 --> 1:09:51.909
We have to be sure.

1:09:57.009 --> 1:09:58.509
Mary.

1:10:05.007 --> 1:10:07.207
You're carrying
in your left pocket

1:10:07.307 --> 1:10:10.207
a red ribbon
sprayed with her scent.

1:10:12.507 --> 1:10:14.307
You breathe it in sometimes

1:10:14.406 --> 1:10:17.306
when you think
there's no one to see.

1:10:17.406 --> 1:10:21.306
But what you feel...

1:10:21.405 --> 1:10:23.905
what you feel
could only be satisfied

1:10:24.005 --> 1:10:26.605
by falling yourself into her.

1:10:32.304 --> 1:10:35.504
She's scheduled
for combustion...

1:10:35.604 --> 1:10:37.804
tomorrow.

1:10:43.603 --> 1:10:45.803
I know.

1:10:47.102 --> 1:10:49.502
You know, I was like you.

1:10:49.602 --> 1:10:53.502
But the first thing
you learn about emotion

1:10:53.601 --> 1:10:56.001
is that it has its price...

1:10:56.001 --> 1:10:58.901
a complete paradox.

1:10:59.001 --> 1:11:01.901
But without restraint...

1:11:01.900 --> 1:11:04.200
without control...

1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:06.200
emotion is chaos.

1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:08.300
But how is that diff...

1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:11.900
The difference being is
that when we want to feel,

1:11:11.900 --> 1:11:14.100
we can.

1:11:14.099 --> 1:11:17.699
It's just that...

1:11:17.799 --> 1:11:21.699
some of us...

1:11:21.798 --> 1:11:23.998
some of us have to forgo
that luxury

1:11:24.098 --> 1:11:27.198
so that the rest can have it.

1:11:27.298 --> 1:11:29.298
Some very few of us

1:11:29.398 --> 1:11:33.398
have to force ourselves
not to feel.

1:11:35.096 --> 1:11:36.296
Like me.

1:11:38.196 --> 1:11:40.096
Like you.

1:11:45.196 --> 1:11:47.096
What can I do?

1:11:49.695 --> 1:11:51.795
You can kill Father.

1:12:27.290 --> 1:12:29.090
Cleric John Preston...

1:12:29.190 --> 1:12:31.890
You are to come with us
immediately.

1:12:40.989 --> 1:12:43.189
Cleric Preston.

1:12:43.289 --> 1:12:44.489
Sir.

1:12:47.288 --> 1:12:50.488
I've heard
the most disturbing rumor.

1:12:50.588 --> 1:12:51.888
Rumor, sir?

1:12:51.887 --> 1:12:52.887
Yes.

1:12:52.987 --> 1:12:55.287
A rumor maintaining
that one of us,

1:12:55.287 --> 1:12:56.687
one of the Cleric,

1:12:56.787 --> 1:13:00.887
has secretly taken it upon
himself to cease his dose,

1:13:00.987 --> 1:13:03.787
that one of our elite number

1:13:03.886 --> 1:13:07.086
is actually feeling.

1:13:07.186 --> 1:13:09.086
Feeling, sir?

1:13:10.086 --> 1:13:12.786
Are you playing with me,
Cleric?!

1:13:18.184 --> 1:13:19.384
No, sir.

1:13:24.684 --> 1:13:28.184
This person, I'm told,

1:13:28.283 --> 1:13:31.983
is actually attempting
to contact the Resistance.

1:13:33.983 --> 1:13:37.483
Now tell me,
if you'll be so kind,

1:13:37.582 --> 1:13:39.482
how exactly...

1:13:39.482 --> 1:13:42.682
have you been making use
of your time of late?

1:13:48.581 --> 1:13:51.781
Attempting to contact
the Resistance, sir.

1:13:56.380 --> 1:13:58.380
Attempting?

1:14:00.180 --> 1:14:04.180
How is it that you intend
to expose this traitor

1:14:04.279 --> 1:14:07.279
if all you do is attempt?

1:14:12.678 --> 1:14:14.378
You're...

1:14:14.478 --> 1:14:16.278
absolutely...

1:14:16.378 --> 1:14:18.578
100% right, sir.

1:14:19.877 --> 1:14:22.077
Of course I am.

1:14:24.476 --> 1:14:27.976
The Cleric is the final line
of defense.

1:14:27.976 --> 1:14:30.276
If the Resistance
compromises it,

1:14:30.376 --> 1:14:32.776
we are doomed.

1:14:32.875 --> 1:14:36.675
Father is doomed.

1:14:36.676 --> 1:14:39.376
I will redouble
my efforts, sir,

1:14:39.375 --> 1:14:41.175
to locate the Resistance,

1:14:41.275 --> 1:14:42.775
to find this traitor,

1:14:42.875 --> 1:14:46.175
and bring them all to
the Council's fair justice.

1:14:50.473 --> 1:14:51.573
Do it.

1:15:35.968 --> 1:15:37.168
What are you doing?

1:15:40.568 --> 1:15:42.168
What are you doing?

1:15:45.067 --> 1:15:46.567
I, uh...

1:15:51.566 --> 1:15:54.466
I was checking
to make sure you've been...

1:15:54.566 --> 1:15:56.266
taking your interval.

1:15:57.366 --> 1:15:59.066
And are you satisfied?

1:16:02.565 --> 1:16:03.765
Yes, I am.

1:16:07.065 --> 1:16:08.465
Good night, Dad.

1:16:10.564 --> 1:16:12.264
I don't understand.

1:16:12.363 --> 1:16:14.963
My execution's set.

1:16:15.064 --> 1:16:17.464
Why are you here?

1:16:36.661 --> 1:16:38.161
Aren't you gonna dose?

1:16:51.959 --> 1:16:53.959
My God.

1:16:55.958 --> 1:16:56.958
What...

1:17:00.059 --> 1:17:02.159
What'll you do?

1:17:03.758 --> 1:17:05.458
I don't know.

1:17:40.053 --> 1:17:41.353
50 sweepers, maybe more.

1:17:41.454 --> 1:17:43.854
What about an audience? Can you
arrange to meet with him?

1:17:43.953 --> 1:17:45.953
Father's never given a single
audience since the upheaval.

1:17:45.952 --> 1:17:47.552
The danger of assassination
is too great.

1:17:47.653 --> 1:17:49.853
They trained you your whole life
to fight these kind of odds.

1:17:49.953 --> 1:17:51.553
Even if I could...

1:17:51.652 --> 1:17:53.452
even if I could
make it through,

1:17:53.452 --> 1:17:56.652
what guarantee is there
it would accomplish anything,

1:17:56.651 --> 1:17:58.251
that anything would be
different?

1:17:58.351 --> 1:18:01.151
We have a network that's larger
than you could ever imagine.

1:18:01.151 --> 1:18:03.051
Instant word comes
that Father is dead,

1:18:03.151 --> 1:18:04.651
that the Council is leaderless.

1:18:04.650 --> 1:18:06.850
Bombs that have already
been planted will be set off

1:18:06.950 --> 1:18:09.150
at Prozium clinics and factories
around Libria.

1:18:09.250 --> 1:18:11.550
If we can succeed
in disrupting the supply

1:18:11.650 --> 1:18:14.350
for even one day... one day...

1:18:14.349 --> 1:18:16.949
our cause will be won
by human nature itself.

1:18:17.049 --> 1:18:20.049
What about war, the everyday
cruelties that are all gone now?

1:18:20.148 --> 1:18:22.148
Replaced by the touch
of Grammaton.

1:18:25.948 --> 1:18:28.048
Will you do it?

1:18:35.947 --> 1:18:37.947
Yes.

1:18:39.747 --> 1:18:40.847
Can you?

1:18:44.646 --> 1:18:46.346
I don't know.

1:18:56.445 --> 1:18:58.145
Don't...

1:19:00.044 --> 1:19:01.444
Seeing her one last time

1:19:01.544 --> 1:19:04.644
will only make it harder
to do what you have to do.

1:19:39.239 --> 1:19:41.839
...designed especially
to deal with it.

1:19:41.939 --> 1:19:43.439
The Cleric was implemented

1:19:43.539 --> 1:19:45.939
and sent out to search
and destroy

1:19:45.939 --> 1:19:47.439
such objects that remained

1:19:47.538 --> 1:19:50.438
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

1:19:50.538 --> 1:19:51.938
File footage.

1:19:52.038 --> 1:19:55.638
The Council...

1:19:55.737 --> 1:19:58.237
Viviana Preston.

1:19:58.337 --> 1:20:00.337
Sentence and incineration.

1:20:03.036 --> 1:20:04.136
Auditory.

1:20:04.136 --> 1:20:05.536
Viviana Preston,

1:20:05.636 --> 1:20:08.036
for ceasing your interval,
for the crime of feeling,

1:20:08.036 --> 1:20:09.236
you stand condemned

1:20:09.235 --> 1:20:11.535
to suffer annihilation
in the city furnaces.

1:20:11.535 --> 1:20:15.035
You will be taken there
immediately, and you will burn.

1:20:31.433 --> 1:20:33.933
The Cleric was implemented

1:20:34.033 --> 1:20:35.833
and sent out to search
and destroy

1:20:35.933 --> 1:20:37.433
such objects that remained

1:20:37.532 --> 1:20:41.632
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

1:20:41.632 --> 1:20:43.632
The Council...

1:21:24.327 --> 1:21:26.327
The incineration...
has it gone through?!

1:21:26.326 --> 1:21:28.126
It's going through now.

1:21:28.226 --> 1:21:29.726
Hey!

1:21:57.423 --> 1:22:00.523
Machine turbines priming.

1:22:00.622 --> 1:22:02.222
Machine turbines priming.

1:22:02.323 --> 1:22:04.323
Tetragrammaton... I need
to speak to this woman!

1:22:04.423 --> 1:22:06.023
You're too late, sir.
The time lock is engaged.

1:22:06.122 --> 1:22:07.322
If we force the door now,

1:22:07.422 --> 1:22:08.922
the turbines will explode
at street level.

1:22:09.022 --> 1:22:12.422
...personnel,
clear the area immediately.

1:22:12.521 --> 1:22:16.921
All unauthorized personnel,
clear the area immediately.

1:22:17.021 --> 1:22:20.121
Turbines primed.

1:22:20.121 --> 1:22:22.821
Fire in 10 seconds...

1:22:22.920 --> 1:22:24.720
9 seconds...

1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:26.120
8 seconds...

1:22:26.220 --> 1:22:27.520
7 seconds...

1:22:27.519 --> 1:22:29.819
6 seconds...

1:22:29.919 --> 1:22:31.919
5 seconds...

1:22:32.019 --> 1:22:33.119
4 seconds...

1:22:33.219 --> 1:22:34.819
3 seconds...

1:22:34.918 --> 1:22:37.418
2 seconds...

1:22:37.519 --> 1:22:40.719
Turbines... fire.

1:23:31.412 --> 1:23:34.712
Cleric John Preston...

1:23:40.411 --> 1:23:42.311
You are under arrest.

1:23:44.011 --> 1:23:45.811
This man...

1:23:45.910 --> 1:23:48.210
this senior Cleric...

1:23:48.210 --> 1:23:50.110
has ceased the dose.

1:23:51.210 --> 1:23:53.810
He is feeling!

1:23:53.809 --> 1:23:57.709
He is the worm that has been
eating at the core

1:23:57.809 --> 1:24:00.609
of our great society!

1:24:00.709 --> 1:24:02.409
And I...

1:24:02.408 --> 1:24:05.408
I have brought him
for your justice.

1:24:05.408 --> 1:24:07.108
Ugh!

1:24:09.707 --> 1:24:14.007
I told you I'd make my career
with you, Preston.

1:24:15.007 --> 1:24:16.507
Vice-Council...

1:24:16.606 --> 1:24:18.806
This man is guilty

1:24:18.906 --> 1:24:20.706
of consorting
with sense offenders,

1:24:20.706 --> 1:24:24.006
of having relations
with a female,

1:24:24.106 --> 1:24:27.306
of sense crime itself.

1:24:27.405 --> 1:24:29.705
Dispatch a search team
to the Cleric's quarters

1:24:29.805 --> 1:24:30.805
to search for unused...

1:24:30.905 --> 1:24:32.205
Uh, that won't be
necessary, sir.

1:24:32.204 --> 1:24:34.004
If you'll run the trace
record on his side arm,

1:24:34.105 --> 1:24:36.305
you will find
that it was he

1:24:36.304 --> 1:24:39.204
who was with the sweeper team
when they were murdered.

1:24:44.803 --> 1:24:46.203
Cleric...

1:24:46.203 --> 1:24:48.503
I assume you have something
to say to me.

1:24:50.503 --> 1:24:53.103
I know...

1:24:53.202 --> 1:24:54.702
it's hard to believe...

1:24:57.302 --> 1:25:00.202
...that a Cleric
of the Tetragrammaton

1:25:00.301 --> 1:25:03.401
could turn his back
on everything he's been taught,

1:25:03.401 --> 1:25:05.901
would become associated
with the Resistance,

1:25:06.001 --> 1:25:10.201
even becoming a champion
in its Underground.

1:25:10.301 --> 1:25:12.301
But it's true.

1:25:16.300 --> 1:25:20.700
I promised that I would
bring you that man.

1:25:20.799 --> 1:25:21.799
And I have.

1:25:24.699 --> 1:25:26.899
- Cleric Brandt...
- Sir?

1:25:26.999 --> 1:25:29.899
The trace shows
that it was your gun

1:25:29.898 --> 1:25:32.598
in the Nether
with the sweepers.

1:25:32.597 --> 1:25:34.197
That's impossible.

1:25:38.697 --> 1:25:41.697
This is wrong.

1:25:41.697 --> 1:25:44.497
I think, in the end...

1:25:44.597 --> 1:25:47.497
it'll be better
if you have it.

1:25:47.596 --> 1:25:49.296
He switched them.

1:25:50.295 --> 1:25:52.095
He switched them.

1:25:52.195 --> 1:25:53.895
See, I have his gun now.

1:25:53.995 --> 1:25:56.695
Of course you do. You took it
when you arrested me.

1:25:56.795 --> 1:25:57.695
What?

1:25:57.795 --> 1:25:59.995
Take him
to the Hall of Destruction

1:26:00.095 --> 1:26:02.395
for summary judgment
and combustion.

1:26:02.395 --> 1:26:04.895
Wait, wait, wait. Wait!
I can explain this.

1:26:04.894 --> 1:26:08.094
Uh, sir, I'm not feeling!

1:26:08.093 --> 1:26:10.493
He is the one who's feeling!

1:26:10.593 --> 1:26:12.193
This is a mistake!

1:26:14.293 --> 1:26:16.093
Of course...

1:26:16.092 --> 1:26:18.992
since a complaint
has been lodged,

1:26:19.093 --> 1:26:21.993
law and the letter
is that I allow a team

1:26:22.092 --> 1:26:24.492
to carry out the search
of your premises.

1:26:24.591 --> 1:26:26.691
Do you think that's entirely
necessary, Cleric,

1:26:26.791 --> 1:26:30.791
or am I being
too... exacting?

1:26:30.891 --> 1:26:33.191
As you say, sir,

1:26:33.291 --> 1:26:35.191
it's the law and the letter.

1:26:35.290 --> 1:26:38.290
And it doesn't disturb you
in the least

1:26:38.390 --> 1:26:40.690
that your colleague
is going to his end?

1:26:40.790 --> 1:26:43.190
The only thing
that disturbs me, sir,

1:26:43.289 --> 1:26:45.989
is that I am Father's instrument
against the Underground,

1:26:46.089 --> 1:26:51.189
and yet... I've never had
the honor of meeting him.

1:26:51.289 --> 1:26:53.189
Hmm.

1:26:53.288 --> 1:26:54.988
Yes, but, Cleric, you know

1:26:55.088 --> 1:26:58.088
that Father never grants
an audience to anyone.

1:26:58.188 --> 1:27:00.588
Even to the man
who brings him the Resistance?

1:27:12.986 --> 1:27:14.686
Sorry, sir.
Just a formality.

1:27:14.786 --> 1:27:16.886
The search team will be up
momentarily.

1:27:16.985 --> 1:27:19.585
Excellent.
I have nothing to hide.

1:27:39.683 --> 1:27:41.883
The search teams are
already inside, sir.

1:27:41.883 --> 1:27:43.183
Excellent.

1:28:04.080 --> 1:28:06.380
Looking for something?

1:28:11.179 --> 1:28:12.879
If I were you...

1:28:12.979 --> 1:28:18.079
I'd be more careful
in the future.

1:28:23.177 --> 1:28:24.477
How long?

1:28:24.578 --> 1:28:26.878
Since Mom.

1:28:29.777 --> 1:28:30.877
And Lisa?

1:28:30.977 --> 1:28:32.277
Of course.

1:28:37.076 --> 1:28:38.676
How did you know?

1:28:38.776 --> 1:28:41.276
You forget...

1:28:41.376 --> 1:28:43.776
it's my job to know
what you're thinking.

1:28:46.974 --> 1:28:49.474
Then you know what
I'm gonna do now.

1:28:51.474 --> 1:28:53.274
You have a message
for the Vice-Council?

1:28:53.274 --> 1:28:54.974
You have a message
for the Vice-Council?

1:28:55.073 --> 1:28:56.973
It's done.

1:28:56.974 --> 1:29:00.374
I've located the Resistance.

1:29:00.473 --> 1:29:02.773
Come now.

1:29:02.873 --> 1:29:04.873
You'll have them all.

1:29:26.770 --> 1:29:30.370
Do not address Father
unless first addressed by him.

1:29:30.369 --> 1:29:31.669
Avoid eye contact.

1:29:31.769 --> 1:29:34.969
If you should break
his personal security zone,

1:29:35.069 --> 1:29:37.569
you will be immediately
put down by snipers.

1:29:37.668 --> 1:29:39.268
Is that understood?

1:29:39.369 --> 1:29:42.469
You'll be required to surrender
your firearm, of course,

1:29:42.568 --> 1:29:44.568
and then there's the test.

1:29:44.568 --> 1:29:45.968
Test?

1:29:46.967 --> 1:29:49.367
Yes.

1:29:49.467 --> 1:29:52.467
You didn't imagine
we would risk exposing Father

1:29:52.567 --> 1:29:54.967
to even such a dedicated servant
as yourself

1:29:55.067 --> 1:29:58.367
without first having
tested you, did you?

1:30:02.166 --> 1:30:03.966
Please.

1:30:17.864 --> 1:30:19.264
Cleric...

1:30:19.363 --> 1:30:21.363
your weapon, please.

1:30:25.863 --> 1:30:27.963
Here.

1:30:32.862 --> 1:30:33.962
Sit.

1:30:37.362 --> 1:30:39.562
We'll start with
a test question first.

1:30:39.662 --> 1:30:42.962
More of a riddle, actually.

1:30:44.361 --> 1:30:46.461
What would you say
is the easiest way

1:30:46.560 --> 1:30:48.760
to get a weapon away
from a Grammaton Cleric?

1:30:54.360 --> 1:30:56.960
You ask him for it.

1:31:04.158 --> 1:31:07.058
I told you I'd make
my career with you, Cleric.

1:31:10.558 --> 1:31:11.858
...to combine the capacity...

1:31:13.757 --> 1:31:14.757
Preston...

1:31:14.757 --> 1:31:17.257
Brandt's job was simple...

1:31:17.357 --> 1:31:19.857
to make you feel
like you'd won,

1:31:19.857 --> 1:31:23.057
to make you feel safe.

1:31:26.256 --> 1:31:29.756
For years, I tried
to infiltrate an agent

1:31:29.855 --> 1:31:31.355
into the Underground...

1:31:32.855 --> 1:31:34.855
...until it hit me...

1:31:34.955 --> 1:31:38.655
in order to pass undetected
into their midst,

1:31:38.754 --> 1:31:41.454
in order to be trusted by them,

1:31:41.554 --> 1:31:46.954
my provocateur would
have to think like them

1:31:46.953 --> 1:31:49.853
and would have to feel
like them.

1:31:49.953 --> 1:31:52.853
But where to find
such a man...

1:31:52.952 --> 1:31:58.252
a man with the capacity to feel
who didn't yet know it?

1:32:01.251 --> 1:32:03.951
But...

1:32:03.952 --> 1:32:05.252
we've never met.

1:32:05.351 --> 1:32:07.151
No?

1:32:12.151 --> 1:32:14.751
Don't look so surprised,
Preston.

1:32:14.750 --> 1:32:16.650
Why should Father be more real

1:32:16.750 --> 1:32:19.150
than any other
political puppet?

1:32:19.250 --> 1:32:22.150
The real Father died
years ago.

1:32:22.249 --> 1:32:24.149
The Council simply elected me

1:32:24.249 --> 1:32:27.149
to pursue
his paternal tradition.

1:32:27.248 --> 1:32:29.348
And you, Preston,

1:32:29.448 --> 1:32:32.348
the supposed savior
of the Resistance,

1:32:32.348 --> 1:32:34.248
are now its destroyer,

1:32:34.347 --> 1:32:39.047
and, along with them,
you've given me yourself...

1:32:39.147 --> 1:32:40.847
calmly...

1:32:40.847 --> 1:32:42.747
cooly...

1:32:42.847 --> 1:32:47.547
entirely without incident.

1:32:51.646 --> 1:32:53.246
No.

1:32:54.846 --> 1:32:55.846
Oh...

1:32:56.645 --> 1:32:57.745
Shit.

1:32:59.745 --> 1:33:01.445
Not without incident.

1:33:08.444 --> 1:33:09.944
I'm coming.

1:34:38.934 --> 1:34:40.734
You really should learn
to knock.

1:35:07.330 --> 1:35:10.730
How did it feel, Preston?

1:35:24.328 --> 1:35:26.528
- Agh!
- Ugh! Ugh! Uhh-ah!

1:35:28.427 --> 1:35:29.827
Wah!

1:35:29.927 --> 1:35:31.627
Ugh! Agh! Uhh!

1:35:31.627 --> 1:35:33.227
Ugh!

1:35:34.426 --> 1:35:35.526
Ugh!

1:35:35.626 --> 1:35:37.626
- Aggh!
- Aggh!

1:35:51.525 --> 1:35:54.325
Mind the uniform, Cleric.

1:35:59.924 --> 1:36:03.124
I plan to be wearing it
for a long time.

1:36:38.919 --> 1:36:41.619
Be careful, Preston.

1:36:41.618 --> 1:36:44.018
You're treading on my dreams.

1:37:19.114 --> 1:37:20.414
Ohh!

1:37:20.414 --> 1:37:22.214
Wait!

1:37:22.313 --> 1:37:23.313
Wait.

1:37:23.413 --> 1:37:24.813
Look at me.

1:37:24.914 --> 1:37:26.014
Look at me.

1:37:28.113 --> 1:37:29.813
I'm life.

1:37:29.913 --> 1:37:33.313
I live, I-I breathe...

1:37:35.413 --> 1:37:36.913
I feel.

1:37:38.912 --> 1:37:41.712
Now that you know it...

1:37:41.812 --> 1:37:44.612
can you really take it?

1:37:44.711 --> 1:37:46.711
Is it really worth the price?

1:37:52.810 --> 1:37:54.510
I pay it gladly.

Two millennia ago...

1:38:39.505 --> 1:38:41.105

of the known world,

more than one million

Three centuries later,
purely out of jealousy,

Gaius Germanicus, "Caligula,"

impregnated
with his own child.
