00:39.736 --> 00:40.836
So, this is jail.

00:40.871 --> 00:44.707
It's not so bad.

00:44.741 --> 00:46.509
Steel benches...

00:46.543 --> 00:48.411
Concrete floors.

00:48.445 --> 00:49.712
There's a toilet in the corner.

00:51.815 --> 00:54.684
Somebody get me out of here!

00:55.719 --> 00:57.453
Riley, oh my God!

00:57.487 --> 01:00.556
daddy's okay sweetie,
he's just stuck in a very large crib.

01:00.590 --> 01:02.658
Riley, you're not going to believe this...

01:02.693 --> 01:03.759
We're in jail!

01:05.495 --> 01:08.731
And I can't believe you all managed to
get yourselves arrested on Halloween.

01:08.765 --> 01:10.633
Tell the police I want to cut them a deal.

01:10.667 --> 01:13.369
Okay, I'll give them names,
numbers, addresses.

01:13.403 --> 01:15.337
I'll wear a wire, anything, please!

01:15.372 --> 01:17.573
Somebody shut the little
one up before I shiv him.

01:17.607 --> 01:20.810
Riley, please, just work your legal
magic and get us all out of here.

01:20.844 --> 01:25.381
I'm sorry, but no amount of lawyering
will make any of this go away.

01:25.415 --> 01:26.816
Assaulting a police officer...

01:26.850 --> 01:28.584
Resisting arrest...

01:28.618 --> 01:30.352
Indecent exposure...

01:30.387 --> 01:31.787
And Mrs. Wheeler...

01:31.822 --> 01:34.790
Murder? Seriously?

01:34.825 --> 01:37.526
Not my best day.

01:37.561 --> 01:38.828
Riley, I know it sounds bad,

01:38.862 --> 01:40.396
but please, just hear us out?

01:40.430 --> 01:41.664
I can explain everything.

01:41.698 --> 01:42.832
I'm listening.

01:42.866 --> 01:44.600
It all started this morning.

01:44.634 --> 01:45.601
You know, you were there.

01:50.474 --> 01:52.508
Okay. As long as we stay on track,

01:52.542 --> 01:54.677
I think we can meet all of
our Halloween party goals.

01:54.711 --> 01:55.711
Tucker, costume check?

01:55.746 --> 01:57.747
Oh, well, much like the ladies,

01:57.781 --> 01:59.548
all we gotta do is pick them up.

02:00.584 --> 02:01.684
Ben, tickets?

02:01.718 --> 02:04.353
Got 'em.
You guys, they made me sign a waiver.

02:04.387 --> 02:05.554
Because we could die.

02:05.589 --> 02:07.223
Isn't that awesome?

02:07.257 --> 02:10.359
No, just sounds like another
lame Halloween party to me.

02:10.393 --> 02:12.228
Oh, no, no, no, it's not just a party.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.930
It's the single greatest
event this city has ever seen.

02:14.965 --> 02:17.833
Yeah, it's at a club downtown.
There's gonna be two dj's.

02:17.868 --> 02:20.536
Just in case one of them dies.

02:20.570 --> 02:21.504
Girls in sexy outfits.

02:21.538 --> 02:22.538
A costume contest.

02:22.572 --> 02:24.673
Oh, and did I mention girls in sexy outfits?

02:24.708 --> 02:28.410
You guys, I think something's
wrong with your garbage disposal.

02:31.181 --> 02:32.281
Oh my God!

02:41.124 --> 02:43.125
- I say we roll into the party 30 minutes late.
- Yeah.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.827
Okay, that was perfect.

02:44.861 --> 02:46.595
How could you not freak out?

02:46.630 --> 02:48.931
Riley, don't you know by now,
you can't prank the wheelers?

02:48.965 --> 02:50.666
The kings of Halloween.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.802
Yeah,
history would prove we are unprank-able,

02:52.836 --> 02:54.670
except for that time that Uncle ned got us

02:54.704 --> 02:56.438
and we wound up in Mexico, but...

02:56.473 --> 02:58.374
That was less of a prank
and more of a kidnapping.

03:00.143 --> 03:02.511
Need I remind you of the
wasabi toothpaste incident,

03:02.546 --> 03:04.046
the bleeding doorbell,

03:04.080 --> 03:06.048
or the exploding night light?

03:06.082 --> 03:08.150
It took two months for
eyebrows to grow back.

03:10.053 --> 03:12.188
Well then, can we call a truce, please?

03:12.222 --> 03:14.757
May I extend an olive branch?

03:14.791 --> 03:15.758
Banana smoothie?

03:15.792 --> 03:18.027
Oh, that's so sweet of you, Riley.

03:18.061 --> 03:20.596
Uh, hey, do you mind taking the first sip?

03:22.566 --> 03:23.732
Seriously, Ben?

03:23.767 --> 03:25.501
You think I'm gonna try to prank you

03:25.535 --> 03:27.570
right after I just agreed not to prank you?

03:27.604 --> 03:29.572
Yeah, pretty much.

03:31.408 --> 03:32.374
Fine.

03:37.948 --> 03:38.914
Mmm.

03:38.949 --> 03:40.216
See?

03:40.250 --> 03:41.217
Absolutely just...

03:41.251 --> 03:43.219
Oh my God, oh my God, my lips are burning!

03:44.855 --> 03:47.656
Ding dong, the witch ain't dead!

03:47.691 --> 03:48.757
What up, boos?

03:50.594 --> 03:52.094
Hey, mom. What is all that stuff?

03:52.128 --> 03:55.698
Emma's goldilocks needs her three
bears for trick-or-treating tonight.

03:55.732 --> 03:58.367
Large, medium...

03:58.401 --> 03:59.368
And Tucker.

04:01.571 --> 04:04.473
Do you ever worry that one of these days,
a house is gonna fall on you?

04:06.176 --> 04:08.310
Mom, I'm not actually taking
Emma trick-or-treating.

04:08.345 --> 04:10.246
She has no idea what it is.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.247
Right, Emma?

04:12.249 --> 04:14.216
See? No idea.

04:14.251 --> 04:17.052
Well, I would love to take Emma tonight,

04:17.087 --> 04:19.822
but I have a very important meeting

04:19.856 --> 04:22.658
with a sex God named "Javier."

04:25.795 --> 04:27.763
Come on, guys!

04:27.797 --> 04:31.533
Javier is this international
hottie that I met online.

04:31.568 --> 04:35.271
And we have been sending the most
romantic emails for the last six months.

04:35.305 --> 04:36.605
He's in town for one night.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.308
And I'm having him over
so we can finally meet.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.922
Well, don't you want to
meet this guy somewhere in

04:44.022 --> 04:46.248
public before committing
to an evening with him?

04:46.283 --> 04:48.183
yeah, but that kills the mystery.

04:48.218 --> 04:50.185
He's a random guy from the Internet.

04:50.220 --> 04:51.987
What would you rather have killed,

04:52.022 --> 04:53.856
the mystery, or you?

04:55.725 --> 04:58.427
You know,
I've never said to you before Riley, but...

04:58.461 --> 04:59.662
You may not be wrong.

05:01.598 --> 05:04.433
You know what?
I'll pre-screen him at the bar.

05:04.467 --> 05:06.468
Ooh, Halloween donut.

05:07.570 --> 05:10.306
Yeah, I got freaky-fritters,

05:10.340 --> 05:11.440
Boston screams.

05:11.474 --> 05:13.442
Yum, this is delicious.

05:18.848 --> 05:19.848
I should not have done that.

05:19.883 --> 05:20.950
- Probably not.
- Nope.

05:22.218 --> 05:23.185
Gotcha!

05:23.753 --> 05:25.988
- Every time.
- Gotcha!

05:27.691 --> 05:28.824
Tucker, you get the costumes?

05:28.858 --> 05:30.592
Don't worry Pirate Wheeler,

05:30.627 --> 05:32.695
I even ordered you a fake
leg to store beer in.

05:32.729 --> 05:35.698
Ooh, a keg-leg, all right.

05:35.732 --> 05:37.499
What are you going as tonight?

05:37.534 --> 05:38.701
A superhero.

05:38.735 --> 05:40.402
I was gonna go as Dracula,

05:40.437 --> 05:43.372
but I accidentally
swallowed my vampire teeth.

05:43.406 --> 05:45.541
Now I'm scared to go to the bathroom.

05:45.575 --> 05:48.043
Well, I'll tell you what's scary.

05:48.078 --> 05:50.412
Your mom and her
international man of mystery.

05:50.447 --> 05:53.015
I mean, what do we even know about this guy?

05:53.049 --> 05:55.851
Bonnie, I had a great time.

05:55.885 --> 05:58.921
I still don't understand how a beautiful,
blonde,

05:58.955 --> 06:02.558
35-year-old,
successful businesswoman is single.

06:02.592 --> 06:04.660
You seem too good to be true.

06:06.563 --> 06:07.696
So do you,

06:07.731 --> 06:09.665
but I'm not asking a lot of questions.

06:11.334 --> 06:14.169
See you tonight, Javier.
Here's a little preview.

06:18.174 --> 06:19.441
Ha-ha!

06:19.476 --> 06:21.377
Still got it.

06:21.411 --> 06:24.046
And if you're lucky, you will too.

06:28.051 --> 06:30.019
Yeah... I don't know what that means.

06:31.888 --> 06:33.789
Mrs. Wheeler.

06:33.823 --> 06:36.725
Not to be a downer,
but are you sure you can trust this guy?

06:36.760 --> 06:39.495
Oh, Riley, don't be jealous.

06:39.529 --> 06:40.863
It's not a good color on you.

06:40.897 --> 06:42.664
Also, that color's not a good color on you.

06:44.467 --> 06:46.502
Besides, I totally checked him out.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.504
It's just I worry about you.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.539
You're like the big sister
I always wished I had.

06:50.573 --> 06:53.242
Aww, thanks, Riley.

06:53.276 --> 06:55.110
- To us?
- To us.

06:55.145 --> 06:56.879
Oh, I love your shoes!

06:56.913 --> 06:59.048
Thank you so much.
I know, I got them on sale.

06:59.082 --> 07:02.651
Did you really?
They're so cute with those things.

07:06.890 --> 07:08.824
- Yeah.
- Oh my God!

07:08.858 --> 07:10.826
Oh my God, my gums are melting!

07:15.365 --> 07:16.565
Ugh, what did you put in this?

07:18.401 --> 07:19.435
To tonight!

07:19.469 --> 07:20.469
Tonight!

07:20.503 --> 07:24.039
It's gonna be the best Halloween ever!

07:26.409 --> 07:28.944
Worst Halloween ever.

07:28.978 --> 07:30.779
I can't believe they canceled the party.

07:30.814 --> 07:32.881
Just like that, Halloween is ruined.

07:32.916 --> 07:35.617
Well, look on the bright side.

07:35.652 --> 07:38.654
You know, now we can all hang out
together and take Emma trick-or-treating.

07:40.824 --> 07:42.458
What?

07:42.492 --> 07:45.461
Riley, you can't replace something
awesome with something awe-less.

07:45.495 --> 07:46.695
It's simple physics.

07:48.231 --> 07:50.299
But you wouldn't understand since
you didn't already have plans.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.034
Right, loser implied.

07:52.068 --> 07:54.002
Exactly.

07:54.037 --> 07:56.171
Okay, I could have plans if I wanted to.

07:56.206 --> 08:00.209
In fact, I just got invited to a huge
party downtown by a girl I work with.

08:00.243 --> 08:02.811
But partying with a bunch of drunken,
half-naked women

08:02.846 --> 08:04.079
isn't really my idea of a good time.

08:04.114 --> 08:05.781
But it's my idea of a good time.

08:05.815 --> 08:07.716
Take me, take me!

08:07.750 --> 08:09.918
It's really not that kind of a party.

08:09.953 --> 08:11.987
But, I will see you guys tonight.

08:12.522 --> 08:13.822
Oh, yay. This is gonna be so fun.

08:13.857 --> 08:15.791
Wait, somebody go after her!

08:15.825 --> 08:18.460
She's like an all-access pass to hotness.

08:20.663 --> 08:23.332
Nobody move. Nobody move.

08:23.366 --> 08:25.267
Look what she left behind, her phone!

08:28.204 --> 08:29.338
Come on, come on, come on...

08:29.372 --> 08:31.140
Yes, address and everything!

08:33.009 --> 08:34.376
Oh, I forgot my phone.

08:34.943 --> 08:36.311
Yeah, here it is in my hand. How convenient.

08:36.346 --> 08:38.847
- Oh thank you so much.
- Yeah, cool, see you later.

08:38.881 --> 08:40.082
Great shirt, love your pants, all right.

08:42.085 --> 08:44.753
Gentlemen,
let's lock and load and hit the road.

08:44.787 --> 08:46.955
Let's kick the tires and light the fires.

08:46.990 --> 08:48.891
Let's have some fun and...

08:51.427 --> 08:53.362
Argh.
Sorry, I didn't know we were each doing one.

08:53.396 --> 08:54.329
It's okay, man.

08:57.233 --> 08:59.334
We never should have gone to that party.

08:59.369 --> 09:00.435
Oh, by the way, we went to your party.

09:04.352 --> 09:05.352
Guys.

09:05.387 --> 09:07.488
I hold in my hand the key

09:07.522 --> 09:09.356
to a night of "hello, how are you?"

09:09.391 --> 09:12.193
And a morning of
"what do you want for breakfast?"

09:13.929 --> 09:15.429
One superhero.

09:15.464 --> 09:18.132
Sweet! Oh, this is the only night of
the year where a man can wear tights

09:18.166 --> 09:19.800
and not be totally embarrassed.

09:23.038 --> 09:25.039
Wow, you're gonna look so pretty.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.477
No! No, no, no, no, no. What is happening?

09:29.511 --> 09:32.713
Tucker,
why the hell am I attracted to my costume?

09:32.747 --> 09:35.249
Wait, there must have been some
sort of mix-up at the store.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.550
How did this happen? What did you tell them?

09:36.585 --> 09:39.119
I told them I wanted
the costumes to be sexy.

09:40.222 --> 09:41.422
Why would you say that?

09:41.456 --> 09:43.324
I don't know.

09:43.358 --> 09:45.993
Dude, we're supposed to
wear costumes to that party.

09:46.027 --> 09:47.261
What are we going to do now?

09:50.031 --> 09:54.635
Well, I guess we're just
gonna have to grin and bear it.

09:54.669 --> 09:56.537
That's your last one of those, okay?

09:56.571 --> 10:00.441
Why? Can't bear to hear my comedy?

10:00.475 --> 10:03.310
Beary's take a brief paws.

10:07.582 --> 10:09.250
Now remember Emma,

10:09.284 --> 10:11.218
the trick is for you to stay quiet,

10:11.253 --> 10:12.453
so grandma gets a treat.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.026
Well, hello little boy.

10:19.060 --> 10:20.861
Would you like some candy?

10:20.896 --> 10:22.863
By the way, tonight my name is Candy.

10:24.065 --> 10:25.933
That's good because I
got a giant sweet tooth.

10:31.706 --> 10:32.740
Is this the only exit?

10:32.774 --> 10:34.542
Well, there's a fire escape,

10:34.576 --> 10:36.477
but you gotta get past me.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.678
Does anyone else know I'm here?

10:37.712 --> 10:40.481
Just everyone following Bonnie-Gets-Some

10:43.285 --> 10:45.152
I may have pre-bragged a little.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.061
I told you I'm working late tonight.

10:54.095 --> 10:55.896
No, no, no, no, calm down.

10:55.931 --> 10:56.997
Of course I love you.

11:00.035 --> 11:02.703
My boss.

11:02.737 --> 11:05.639
We're very close.

11:05.674 --> 11:08.576
Now, where were we, eh?

11:08.610 --> 11:09.643
Hello!

11:09.678 --> 11:12.346
One Bo peep, looking for her sheep.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.248
Emma-a-a-a-a-a!

11:15.317 --> 11:16.350
Who are you?

11:16.384 --> 11:17.785
Who is she?

11:17.819 --> 11:21.155
Just some desperate girl trying to
sex it up in an inappropriate costume.

11:21.189 --> 11:23.090
I mean, come on.

11:23.124 --> 11:24.892
Uh, are the guys ready?

11:24.926 --> 11:26.927
We're taking Emma trick-or-treating.

11:26.962 --> 11:29.129
Sorry, Bo,
it looks like you lost your peeps.

11:30.999 --> 11:32.866
They left about 20 minutes
ago for some party,

11:32.901 --> 11:36.604
but feel free to take Emma
and scra-a-a-a-a-a-am.

11:38.573 --> 11:39.807
A party?

11:40.375 --> 11:41.875
Why wouldn't they invite me?

11:41.910 --> 11:44.345
Well, probably because they would have
to admit that they found your phone

11:44.379 --> 11:47.147
and stole the address and
are totally crashing it.

11:47.182 --> 11:48.315
Why would they do that?

11:48.350 --> 11:50.985
The bigger question is,
why are you still here?

11:52.120 --> 11:53.087
Hello!

11:53.121 --> 11:55.923
Party... pooper...

11:57.092 --> 11:58.926
But it's not a Halloween party.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.661
It's a bachelorette party.

12:02.564 --> 12:03.764
Okay, so just be cool...

12:03.798 --> 12:05.065
And...

12:05.100 --> 12:08.435
Oh my God, we must have died
in the taxi and this is heaven.

12:09.671 --> 12:11.639
I knew God was a dude.

12:13.408 --> 12:14.475
Hey, I'm Heidi,

12:14.509 --> 12:16.243
I was getting worried you wouldn't show.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.447
Not exactly the sexiest costumes...

12:20.482 --> 12:22.116
But I guess you'll do.

12:22.150 --> 12:24.051
Oh, sorry, there was a mix-up at the...

12:24.085 --> 12:25.252
Well, wait, how did you know we were coming?

12:25.286 --> 12:26.920
You're the strippers, aren't you?

12:26.955 --> 12:28.922
I'm sorry, there must be a slight mix-up.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.991
We're not actually strippers...

12:31.026 --> 12:33.093
We're also not actually bears.

12:34.729 --> 12:35.896
I'm Tucker Dobbs.

12:35.930 --> 12:38.766
And I think you'll find me just right.

12:41.336 --> 12:43.604
Um, would it be cool if we
stayed and partied anyway?

12:43.638 --> 12:45.239
Um, no.

12:45.273 --> 12:47.341
If you're not stripping, you need to leave.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.176
But if we strip, we stay?

12:49.210 --> 12:50.477
Ya-huh.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.147
Guys, quick bear huddle.

12:53.181 --> 12:56.083
We did not come all this way to go home now.

12:56.117 --> 12:57.217
- Nope.
- I think we can do this.

12:57.252 --> 12:58.952
- So do I.
- Okay, we in?

12:58.987 --> 13:00.721
Oh, we in.

13:00.755 --> 13:02.690
Danny? Danny? Danny!

13:05.927 --> 13:07.628
Dude, wait for us!

13:11.694 --> 13:13.228
Javier.

13:13.262 --> 13:16.097
Come sit down next to nurse Bonnie.

13:16.132 --> 13:18.133
Take your shirt off and
I'll take your temperature.

13:19.302 --> 13:20.302
I thought I heard something.

13:20.336 --> 13:21.603
Did you hear something?

13:21.637 --> 13:24.940
Just the sound of my youth ticking
away if we don't get to this.

13:27.844 --> 13:29.010
That must be my boss again.

13:29.045 --> 13:30.011
He's very demanding.

13:31.814 --> 13:33.648
He's also very pretty.

13:33.683 --> 13:35.684
And a woman, hmm?

13:35.718 --> 13:40.489
Hey, listen Javier.
I wasn't born mañana, okay?

13:40.523 --> 13:42.491
All right, the nervous pacing,

13:42.525 --> 13:43.525
checking the exits,

13:43.559 --> 13:45.494
mysterious phone calls from lady friends.

13:45.528 --> 13:49.231
And the most suspicious thing of all...

13:49.265 --> 13:51.233
Barely touching me.

13:51.267 --> 13:53.134
I'm beginning to think you're a liar.

13:53.169 --> 13:55.036
Please, I would never lie to you.

13:55.071 --> 13:56.738
Okay, you know what? We are done, all right?

13:56.772 --> 13:58.740
Habla adios my friend

13:58.774 --> 14:01.109
there are plenty more of
you where that came from.

14:01.143 --> 14:03.845
You're not the only weirdo
I've been emailing with.

14:04.847 --> 14:05.981
Oh God.

14:07.517 --> 14:09.684
How dare you!

14:13.456 --> 14:14.456
Hi.

14:14.490 --> 14:17.292
Hey, Javier, I think your boss is here.

14:23.266 --> 14:25.367
Keep it simple, follow my lead,

14:25.401 --> 14:27.302
and don't ask why I know how to do this.

15:20.856 --> 15:22.624
Oh no, the cops.

15:22.658 --> 15:25.427
They're not real cops.
They must be the real strippers.

15:25.461 --> 15:27.462
Ladies, I hate to be the bad guy here,

15:27.496 --> 15:29.230
but we need to shut this party down.

15:30.499 --> 15:33.969
Hey, buddy, isn't the cop
stripper outfit a little cliche?

15:34.003 --> 15:36.104
Look, we can either do this the easy way

15:36.138 --> 15:37.172
or the hard way.

15:39.875 --> 15:42.611
Dude, we used that line a half-an-hour ago.

15:42.645 --> 15:43.912
We're not strippers.

15:43.946 --> 15:46.915
Uh, oh yeah, I think the cheap
breakaway pants say otherwise.

15:46.949 --> 15:48.369
Right.

15:49.268 --> 15:54.372
- One more time.
- You're not strippers, are you?

15:54.406 --> 15:57.175
No. And you're under arrest.

15:57.209 --> 15:59.177
Run for it!

16:03.081 --> 16:05.650
Guys, guys, guys!

16:05.684 --> 16:07.018
Either get some subtitles,

16:07.586 --> 16:09.687
or get out!

16:13.458 --> 16:14.759
I'm just gonna go out in the hallway

16:14.793 --> 16:17.628
and let you two lovebirds settle this alone.

16:17.663 --> 16:19.564
You know, feel free to break anything,

16:19.598 --> 16:21.232
I don't live here.

16:24.570 --> 16:26.370
Not my best date.

16:26.405 --> 16:29.407
But sadly, not my worst.

16:29.441 --> 16:32.076
Sofia, no!

16:34.112 --> 16:35.813
Aah, oh my God!

16:37.115 --> 16:38.816
Oh my God!

16:38.850 --> 16:40.685
Oh God.

16:40.719 --> 16:42.520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

16:44.690 --> 16:47.758
Hurry, call the police!

16:51.630 --> 16:53.531
No, no, no, no, no,
you're making a big mistake.

16:53.565 --> 16:54.665
You got the wrong girl.

16:54.700 --> 16:56.234
Okay, please don't do this.

16:56.268 --> 16:59.237
I'll never make it in prison. I'm too cute!

16:59.271 --> 17:01.372
I am a respected, registered nurse!

17:01.406 --> 17:04.108
I am due in the O.R. this evening!

17:07.079 --> 17:08.279
That's how it all went down.

17:08.313 --> 17:10.214
You see, Riley?
We're all completely innocent.

17:10.749 --> 17:12.750
No, none of you are innocent.

17:12.784 --> 17:15.553
They're pressing charges and you're
all going to be arraigned tomorrow.

17:15.587 --> 17:17.855
- What?!
- God, I can't believe this is happening.

17:17.888 --> 17:19.089
I should've just listened to mom

17:19.124 --> 17:21.492
and taken Emma trick-or-treating
like a responsible dad.

17:21.526 --> 17:22.760
I'm such an idiot.

17:22.794 --> 17:24.729
Sorry, bro, I blame myself.

17:24.762 --> 17:26.396
Yeah, I blame Danny, too.

17:26.431 --> 17:28.232
I'm actually in the Ben's-an-idiot camp.

17:29.234 --> 17:30.301
Riley, what can we do?

17:30.335 --> 17:34.305
I'm sorry,
there's nothing that you can do...

17:34.339 --> 17:36.207
Except maybe call me...

17:36.241 --> 17:38.142
The queen of Halloween!

17:39.878 --> 17:41.145
Oh, oh, you guys look confused.

17:41.179 --> 17:42.847
Perhaps I can explain.

17:42.881 --> 17:46.751
Last Halloween, as the paramedics
were ungluing me from my bike,

17:46.785 --> 17:47.818
I thought to myself,

17:47.886 --> 17:49.987
"Riley,
you need to plan the prank of a lifetime

17:50.022 --> 17:52.523
that will even the score once and for all."

17:52.557 --> 17:53.791
Oh, still confused?

17:53.825 --> 17:56.527
Well, she played the part of Heidi,

17:56.561 --> 18:00.464
give it up for my manicurist, Tracy!

18:00.499 --> 18:03.200
- What?
- Whoa!

18:03.235 --> 18:04.602
The officers that arrested you boys?

18:04.636 --> 18:08.139
My friends from the courthouse,
Rick and Charlie!

18:08.173 --> 18:09.473
- What?
- No way.

18:09.508 --> 18:12.209
Whoa, man, she really got you idiots.

18:12.244 --> 18:14.211
I got you too, Mrs. Wheeler.

18:14.246 --> 18:17.214
He played the part of the philandering,
international sleazeball,

18:17.249 --> 18:20.151
let's hear it for my dry
cleaner and wannabe-actor,

18:20.185 --> 18:21.852
Javier!

18:21.887 --> 18:23.688
I kept his real name. I liked it.

18:23.722 --> 18:24.789
Please, Mrs. Wheeler...

18:24.823 --> 18:26.290
And last, but not least,

18:26.325 --> 18:30.594
you know her as Sofia, the jealous
housewife with a taste for murder,

18:30.629 --> 18:32.697
let's hear it for my downstairs neighbor,

18:32.731 --> 18:34.765
say hi, to Judy!

18:36.435 --> 18:37.735
I don't even speak Spanish.

18:39.338 --> 18:41.205
The six months of emails from Javier?

18:41.239 --> 18:42.306
Ah, yeah, that was me.

18:42.341 --> 18:44.208
The invitation to the
world's greatest party?

18:44.242 --> 18:45.343
Yup, me too.

18:45.377 --> 18:47.278
The costume screwup, the bachelorette party?

18:47.312 --> 18:48.279
The stripping?

18:48.313 --> 18:50.014
Me, me, me!

18:50.048 --> 18:53.150
In fact,
the answer to all of your questions is me.

18:53.185 --> 18:56.253
All a part of my grand scheme
to get you Wheeler's back.

18:56.288 --> 18:58.789
But I'm not a Wheeler!

18:58.824 --> 19:00.157
Collateral damage, my friend.

19:00.192 --> 19:01.792
Collateral damage.

19:01.827 --> 19:05.996
And all I can say now is I got you good!
Yes!

19:06.031 --> 19:07.898
So, we're not actually arrested?

19:07.933 --> 19:09.567
Free to go.

19:11.803 --> 19:14.572
Emma. Hi, sweetie.

19:14.606 --> 19:17.441
Next year I promise it's just you and me,
kiddo, okay?

19:18.443 --> 19:20.745
I can't believe I traded my shoes for soap.

19:20.779 --> 19:22.580
I can't believe I sent you those pictures.

19:22.614 --> 19:25.416
Yeah, neither can I.

19:27.285 --> 19:29.320
You know, Riley,
I didn't think you had it in you.

19:29.354 --> 19:30.488
But you didn't win.

19:30.522 --> 19:32.089
Sure I did!

19:32.124 --> 19:34.425
There is no way any of you saw that coming.

19:34.459 --> 19:35.459
Wait for it.

19:35.527 --> 19:37.294
Oh God.

19:37.329 --> 19:39.296
Did somebody put itching powder in my bra?

19:39.331 --> 19:40.331
No Riley.

19:40.365 --> 19:42.299
Somebody put itching
powder in all of your bras.

19:42.334 --> 19:43.367
Happy Halloween.

19:43.402 --> 19:45.102
Gotcha!

19:45.137 --> 19:47.104
No, no. No "gotcha."

19:47.139 --> 19:49.473
I just pulled off the greatest
prank in Halloween history.

19:49.508 --> 19:52.476
I win. Me. I'm the queen of Halloween.

19:52.511 --> 19:55.379
Enjoy your evening, your majesty.

19:57.416 --> 19:59.483
This took up a year of my life!

19:59.518 --> 20:01.185
Can I just have this one thing?

20:01.219 --> 20:02.319
You guys always win.

20:02.354 --> 20:04.355
I've got those pictures Mrs. Wheeler.

20:07.834 --> 20:09.334
You know what, guys?

20:09.934 --> 20:11.201
Prison changes a man.

20:12.236 --> 20:14.904
I hope I can adjust to life on the outside.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.941
I don't know. I made a lot of friends.

20:17.975 --> 20:20.777
That guy Frankie said I can
come back and see him any time.

20:21.946 --> 20:23.780
What's a conjugal visit, anyway?

20:25.816 --> 20:28.084
All right,
it's been a long day for all of us.

20:28.118 --> 20:29.953
Time for our little girl to go to bed.

20:29.987 --> 20:31.087
Say good night, Emma.

20:31.121 --> 20:32.722
You look so cute.

20:32.756 --> 20:34.757
I love your flower.

20:34.792 --> 20:35.959
Oh yeah!

20:35.993 --> 20:39.128
In the face!

20:39.163 --> 20:40.964
You gotta train 'em young.

20:42.099 --> 20:44.033
Squirting flower, genius.

20:44.068 --> 20:45.868
I rented a warehouse!
