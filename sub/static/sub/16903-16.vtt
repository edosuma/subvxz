WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:03.398
A breakfast date?
Who is this guy?

00:03.466 --> 00:04.894
Uh, I met him on kdate,

00:04.962 --> 00:07.650
Which is the personals section
of the kraft foods website.

00:07.718 --> 00:08.781
And what was he like?

00:08.849 --> 00:10.810
He owns a cockatiel
named Arliss.

00:10.878 --> 00:11.976
Oh, God.

00:12.043 --> 00:13.475
But I'm not letting it
get me down.

00:13.543 --> 00:15.508
I'm just gonna keep putting
positive energy out there,

00:15.575 --> 00:17.509
And something good
will come back to me.

00:17.577 --> 00:19.143
Good morning, Miss Lemon.

00:19.210 --> 00:21.272
A Mr. Debarber called.
Seriously?

00:21.339 --> 00:23.629
A Mr. Debarber called.

00:25.163 --> 00:27.561
Floyd called.
Oh, my God.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.826
That's amazing.
What you said worked.

00:30.894 --> 00:33.927
Okay, universe,

00:33.994 --> 00:35.859
Send me
a white football player--

00:35.927 --> 00:37.459
No kickers or linemen.

Hey, Danny,
congratulations.

00:59.196 --> 01:01.329
Congratulations?
For what?

01:01.397 --> 01:03.363
Danny was nominated
for a Juno,

01:03.431 --> 01:05.230
Which is like
a Canadian Grammy.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.532
Yeah, I recorded
the psych up song that plays

01:07.600 --> 01:09.266
During Ottawa Senators games.

01:09.334 --> 01:11.168

01:16.170 --> 01:18.969
I'm not gonna win, but it's
an honor just to be nominated

01:19.037 --> 01:21.070
In the same category
as Sir Dave Coulier.

01:21.137 --> 01:22.770
Well, it should be
great exposure for ya.

01:22.837 --> 01:24.935
I know! And there's gonna be
a profile of me

01:25.003 --> 01:27.865
In <i>the New York Times</i> as filler
because of dwindling ad sales.

01:27.933 --> 01:30.833
Isn't that awesome?

01:30.900 --> 01:33.967
I am sick
of that guy's positive energy.

01:34.035 --> 01:35.634
We got to start messing
with him.

01:35.702 --> 01:37.635
Yeah. Like, what if
we trick him into kissing me?

01:37.703 --> 01:39.936
It'd be so funny
because I'm not gay.

01:40.004 --> 01:43.604
Or if the pranksmen write
that <i>times</i> profile ourselves,

01:43.672 --> 01:46.072
Making Danny
look like an idiot.

01:46.139 --> 01:47.739
And put it
in the press packet

01:47.807 --> 01:49.506
That everybody gets.

01:49.574 --> 01:52.041
This is the most friends
I've ever had.

01:53.576 --> 01:56.009
Kenneth, I'm having a Tracy
and Jenna problem.

01:56.077 --> 01:57.077
Gosh, Mr. Hornberger,

01:57.145 --> 01:58.478
You say that so often,

01:58.546 --> 02:00.646
You should come up
with a shortcut word for it,

02:00.714 --> 02:03.615
Like, "ivatrennapra."

02:03.683 --> 02:05.316
Well, Danny's interview
with the <i>New York Times</i>

02:05.384 --> 02:07.251
Comes out today,
so "ivatrennapra."

02:07.319 --> 02:08.585
A what?

02:08.652 --> 02:09.853
If Tracy and Jenna hear
about it,

02:09.920 --> 02:10.919
They'll get jealous
and act out,

02:10.988 --> 02:12.021
And as much as I want to,

02:12.089 --> 02:13.922
I can't slap
the brat out of them.

02:13.990 --> 02:16.591
So Tracy and Jenna will spend
the day in the makeup room,

02:16.659 --> 02:19.627
Having full plaster impressions
made of their faces.

02:19.695 --> 02:23.164
So that should shut them up
for, uh, let's say, 12 hours.

02:23.232 --> 02:25.299
Oh, my,
that's a long time.

02:25.367 --> 02:26.700
Maybe I should keep
them company.

02:26.768 --> 02:29.769
Yes.
Tell them your stories.

02:29.837 --> 02:32.971
They'll hate that.

02:33.039 --> 02:34.939
Silly Mr. Hornberger.

02:35.006 --> 02:38.105
Always saying hate
when he means love.

02:42.375 --> 02:43.939
Hello, Floyd.
It's Liz.

02:44.007 --> 02:45.603
Thank you
for calling me back.

02:45.671 --> 02:47.203
We have so much
to catch up on.

02:47.271 --> 02:50.465
Yeah. So how are you?
Oh, my God.

02:50.533 --> 02:52.700
You're not gonna ask me
what's wrong with my voice?

02:52.768 --> 02:54.434
I was being polite.

02:54.502 --> 02:56.936
look, Liz,
I'm sorry I haven't called

02:57.004 --> 02:58.537
In a while, but I'm in New York
for a couple days,

02:58.604 --> 03:00.704
And I, uh--
I'd really like to see you.

03:00.772 --> 03:02.172
Wow. Great.
Okay.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.074
Um, just tell me now
if you've grown a goatee.

03:05.141 --> 03:06.341
No, no, no goatee,

03:06.409 --> 03:07.808
Just chola eyebrows.

03:09.344 --> 03:10.710
So are you free tonight?

03:10.778 --> 03:13.145
Uh, I have to work late.
Can it be tomorrow night?

03:13.212 --> 03:15.446
Yeah. I mean, I'd love
to see you sooner than that,

03:15.513 --> 03:16.713
But, you know,
whatever works.

03:16.781 --> 03:18.714
Okay, well,
I'll call you tomorrow.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.316
Okay, perfect.
Uh, I got to run.

03:20.383 --> 03:21.716
Call me.
Ciao.

03:21.784 --> 03:23.117
Uh.

03:23.185 --> 03:25.485
I don't know how this
happened, Jack,

03:25.553 --> 03:26.486
But it's bad.

03:26.553 --> 03:28.287
I think I really screwed up.

03:28.355 --> 03:29.554
With a female page?
Don't worry.

03:29.621 --> 03:31.122
they disappear all the time.

03:31.189 --> 03:33.123
No, I did an interview
for the <i>New York Times,</i>

03:33.191 --> 03:35.057
And they printed all
of this stuff that I didn't say.

03:35.125 --> 03:36.325
Typical liberal media.

03:36.393 --> 03:37.692
That's why I get
all my news

03:37.760 --> 03:39.860
From Dick Cheney's website--
dickviews.Com.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.828
I never said that Liz banged
her way to the middle

03:42.896 --> 03:45.263
Or that Jenna kidnapped
a Swedish au pair

03:45.331 --> 03:46.497
To use as a hair farm,

03:46.565 --> 03:51.067
And I never called Tracy clean
and articulate.

03:51.134 --> 03:52.569
Why would I?
He's not.

03:52.636 --> 03:54.138
This stuff
is in the newspaper, Jack.

03:54.205 --> 03:55.974
Everyone's gonna see it.
No, they're not.

03:56.042 --> 03:57.710
It's a hoax.
What?

03:57.778 --> 03:59.713
The <i>New York Times</i>
doesn't have a staff writer

03:59.781 --> 04:01.381
Named Seymour Nips.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.149
You've been pranked
by the nerds.

04:03.217 --> 04:08.088
My guess is this is the work
of Frank, the black one,

04:08.155 --> 04:09.689
And...

04:09.757 --> 04:11.157
Lutz.

04:11.225 --> 04:13.159
The writers--
why would they do that to me?

04:13.226 --> 04:15.394
Because they look at you, and
you're everything they're not.

04:15.461 --> 04:16.827
You're handsome.
So are you, Jack.

04:16.894 --> 04:18.028
I wasn't fishing,
but thank you.

04:18.096 --> 04:20.031
Danny, we will not let
this stand.

04:20.098 --> 04:21.332
Well, then what
are we gonna do?

04:21.399 --> 04:23.868
I'm no stranger
to the art of japery.

04:23.936 --> 04:26.104
At Princeton,
I was in a secret society.

04:26.171 --> 04:27.538
I shouldn't tell you this,

04:27.606 --> 04:29.340
But one time
we snuck up to Dartmouth,

04:29.408 --> 04:30.608
Put their mascot
in a box,

04:30.676 --> 04:32.844
And sent it
to Mexico City.

04:32.911 --> 04:34.444
We didn't know
until the next day

04:34.512 --> 04:36.813
That it was
an actual indian.

04:36.881 --> 04:38.414
He didn't speak
a word of english,

04:38.482 --> 04:40.949
Like all Dartmouth men.

04:41.017 --> 04:42.717
All right, I'm game.

04:42.784 --> 04:45.018
Let's team up.
What should we call ourselves?

04:45.086 --> 04:47.620
What's
the most handsome animal?

04:47.688 --> 04:50.056
The silver panther.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.094
Guess who called me?

04:56.162 --> 04:58.061
The boob job recall center?

04:58.129 --> 04:59.929
No.
Floyd.

04:59.997 --> 05:01.397
We're having dinner
tomorrow night,

05:01.465 --> 05:02.465
And I don't know
what it means,

05:02.532 --> 05:04.800
But I am allowing myself
to be excited.

05:04.868 --> 05:06.134
I mean, on the phone,
it was like

05:06.202 --> 05:08.369
We were just right back there,
Liz and Floyd.

05:08.437 --> 05:11.805
Liz and who?
Come on. Floyd.

05:11.873 --> 05:15.241
My ex-boyfriend, the only
good boyfriend I've ever had--

05:15.309 --> 05:17.643
Recovering alcoholic, he used
to work in this building.

05:17.711 --> 05:19.812
Oh, you mean that guy?

05:19.880 --> 05:21.680
And, of course, this is
our other finalist couple

05:21.748 --> 05:24.518
For the <i>today</i> wedding contest,
Floyd and Kaitlin.

05:27.556 --> 05:29.256
Whahk?

05:32.671 --> 05:35.276
An old Gus is the biggest catfish
in the pond.

05:35.456 --> 05:36.576
Legend has it, the only bait

05:36.631 --> 05:37.964
That'll catch old gus

05:37.974 --> 05:39.994
is a piece of old Gus himself.

05:40.004 --> 05:41.324
So everytime they catch him,

05:41.334 --> 05:43.434
they cut off a litlle piece of him

05:43.444 --> 05:44.564
so they can catch him

05:44.574 --> 05:47.094
Now how did the very first person
catch old Gus?

05:47.379 --> 05:50.546
Well, that's a story
for another time--

05:50.613 --> 05:51.780
Right now.

05:51.848 --> 05:53.649
So if my grandfather
hadn't gotten

05:53.717 --> 05:55.183
On the wrong train that day,

05:55.251 --> 05:57.885
He never would have met
his wife's murderer.

05:57.953 --> 06:01.055
I wonder what hawaii's
state quarter's gonna be?

06:01.122 --> 06:02.456
Nobody knows.

06:02.524 --> 06:04.224
But here are

but that is low.

06:26.112 --> 06:27.546
This sucks, Jack.

06:27.613 --> 06:29.380
I know
that I'm a sour person,

06:29.448 --> 06:30.948

06:54.167 --> 06:55.900
I thought that nancy would leave
her husband for me,

06:55.968 --> 06:57.502
And it's not going

06:57.570 --> 06:59.837

07:05.774 --> 07:07.108
I love this woman.

07:07.175 --> 07:08.508
Oh, my God.

07:08.576 --> 07:12.311
I can hear him on the plaza.

07:13.413 --> 07:15.647
Hey, keep it down
out there!

07:15.715 --> 07:19.684
This isn't Liz.

07:19.752 --> 07:21.853
Okay, it's bad enough
that he is getting married,

07:21.920 --> 07:24.222
But does he have to do it
right outside my window?

07:24.289 --> 07:26.557
No. He cannot win
this contest!

07:26.625 --> 07:28.792
Lemon, I know you're hurt,
and I know that look,

07:28.860 --> 07:30.560
But don't even think
about revenge.

07:30.628 --> 07:32.228
You are not a silver panther.

07:32.296 --> 07:34.029
What are you talking about?

07:34.096 --> 07:35.429
Just stick
to the high road.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.030
The low road
is a slippery slope.

07:37.098 --> 07:40.166
I know, Jack.
Believe me.

07:40.234 --> 07:42.134
I mean, it's like, on tv,
it used to be

07:42.202 --> 07:44.269
You couldn't say crap,
and then they let that slide.

07:44.337 --> 07:46.204
And now we can say
whatever we want--

07:46.272 --> 07:47.872
Douche bag, asswipe.

07:47.939 --> 07:49.540
Anal rot.
Exactly.

07:49.607 --> 07:51.475
So I'm simply
gonna ask Floyd,

07:51.542 --> 07:54.844
As a friend and former
intercourse companion,

07:54.911 --> 07:56.578
To do me the favor

07:56.646 --> 07:59.512
Of not getting married
right outside my window.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.880
I'm gonna meet him tomorrow
night at mcshanley's for dinner.

08:01.947 --> 08:04.047
Mcshanley's? The place
where you got food poisoning

08:04.115 --> 08:05.615
From the fish
three times?

08:05.683 --> 08:07.283
So?
So are you sure

08:07.351 --> 08:08.984
You're not planning
to get Floyd sick

08:09.052 --> 08:10.586
And sabotage his chance
of winning?

08:10.653 --> 08:13.187
What? No, Jack, that never
even occurred to me.

08:13.255 --> 08:15.755
Then you'll never be
a silver panther.

08:15.823 --> 08:19.792
I don't care.
I'll start my own group.

08:19.860 --> 08:22.395
Rejection from society
is what created the x-men.

08:22.463 --> 08:25.066
So to get there,
you start on old barn road.

08:25.134 --> 08:27.909
Then you take the first left,
then the next left,

08:27.977 --> 08:30.379
Then the next left,
and then another left.

08:30.446 --> 08:31.780
That'll take you
around the quarry,

08:31.848 --> 08:33.917
Which is real pretty.
I just wanted you to see it.

08:33.985 --> 08:36.086
That'll put you back
on old barn road.

08:36.154 --> 08:38.491
What do you got there?
Have you guys seen this?

08:38.558 --> 08:40.592
We are getting a report
from right here

08:40.659 --> 08:43.659
At rockefeller center
that there is a toxic gas leak

08:43.726 --> 08:44.758
In the building.

08:44.826 --> 08:46.426
Whahk?
The type of gas is unknown,

08:46.494 --> 08:49.328
But it is triggering
the building's autolocks.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.630
What is happening?

08:51.698 --> 08:53.465
Oh, my God,
what do we do?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.000
What do we do?
I know a way out!

08:57.468 --> 08:59.100
What's wrong?

08:59.168 --> 09:00.168
So much of my life

09:00.235 --> 09:01.936
Have I wasted
putting things on hats!

09:02.003 --> 09:04.572
We are now getting reports
that the toxic leak has created

09:04.640 --> 09:07.641
What police are calling
a <i>Cloverfield</i> type monster

09:07.709 --> 09:09.642
In the building.

09:09.710 --> 09:12.644
The monster cannot detect
the smell of human skin.

09:12.712 --> 09:16.447
Anyone still inside
should disrobe immediately.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.820
I'm keeping my hat on.
I don't care, man.

09:24.888 --> 09:26.522
Get them off, Lutz.
Get your shorts off.

09:26.590 --> 09:30.623
Gentlemen,
I wanted some

09:30.691 --> 09:33.328
Of the <i>tgs</i> dancers
to see this.

09:33.395 --> 09:35.330
Now we're even, guys.

09:35.397 --> 09:39.499
As you were, nerds.

09:39.567 --> 09:44.370
<i>Surculus et pruna.</i>
<i>Surculus et pruna.</i>

09:44.438 --> 09:46.273
Now, I don't have
a lot of experience

09:46.341 --> 09:47.709
Reading stuff out loud
to people,

09:47.777 --> 09:50.078
So I'm gonna do this
the most normal way

09:50.146 --> 09:51.713
I can think of.

09:51.781 --> 09:53.848
Space, space, space,
space, space,

09:53.916 --> 09:56.651
Space,
<i>my autobiography,</i> space, space,

09:56.719 --> 09:58.820
Space, space, space,

09:58.888 --> 10:01.289
Space, space, space,
space, space.

10:05.394 --> 10:06.929
Thank you.

10:06.996 --> 10:08.196
Good morning, ladies.

10:08.264 --> 10:09.965
Mm-hmm.
Good morning.

10:10.033 --> 10:14.736
Liz, last night I had a very
graphic dream about Kenneth.

10:14.804 --> 10:16.336
What?
Ugh!

10:16.404 --> 10:17.670
I know.
It's disgusting.

10:17.738 --> 10:19.371
But Tracy and I had to listen
to Kenneth talk

10:19.439 --> 10:20.639
For hours yesterday.

10:20.706 --> 10:22.406
He must have gotten
into my subconscious.

10:22.474 --> 10:24.975
And then I dreamed
that he and I--

10:25.043 --> 10:26.676
I don't want to hear it.
La la la la!

10:26.744 --> 10:28.578
♪ da da, no ♪

10:28.646 --> 10:30.012
Good morning, Mr. Jordan.
Oh, good morning.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.580
Lemaroni,

10:31.647 --> 10:33.580
Something horrible happened
to me last night.

10:33.648 --> 10:35.915
I had a dream
that Kenneth and I got intimate

10:35.982 --> 10:37.082
In a portable jacuzzi.

10:37.150 --> 10:38.817
It was crazy.

10:38.885 --> 10:40.786
Glistening black
and white skin--

10:40.853 --> 10:43.522
It looked like a close-up
of a killer whale being born.

10:43.589 --> 10:45.657
He got me too.
It was horrifying.

10:45.725 --> 10:47.391
Now I never want to go
to sleep.

10:47.459 --> 10:50.493
Just like this amazing city
that we live in.

10:56.265 --> 10:57.398
I knew it.

10:57.465 --> 10:59.232
<i>Surculus et pruna</i>
is the motto

10:59.299 --> 11:00.566
Of the twig and plums.

11:00.633 --> 11:02.600
And your motto is,
"above all, be boring."

11:02.667 --> 11:03.867
Listen to me.

11:03.935 --> 11:06.536
Twig and Plums
is a Princeton secret society,

11:06.603 --> 11:08.172
And Jack is clearly a member.

11:08.239 --> 11:10.440
So?
So they have all kinds

11:10.508 --> 11:11.774
Of weird rituals
and rules,

11:11.842 --> 11:13.809
Like if someone says
"twig and plums"

11:13.877 --> 11:16.078
In front of a member,
he has to find an excuse

11:16.145 --> 11:18.112
To leave the room,
no matter what he's doing.

11:18.180 --> 11:19.714
What?
But during the period

11:19.782 --> 11:20.715
Of the '90s...
Twig and plums!

11:20.782 --> 11:22.183
Thank you, folks.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.885
Excuse me, I have tickets
to a Harry Connick Jr. Concert.

11:24.953 --> 11:28.054
Jack messed
with the wrong fat losers.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.823
Yeah!

11:29.890 --> 11:32.024
This issue is time-sensitive,
so hear me out

11:32.091 --> 11:33.826
Before the overseas markets...

11:33.895 --> 11:36.096
Open for the day.

11:36.164 --> 11:38.131
Twig and plums.

11:39.666 --> 11:40.899
Excuse me, gentlemen.

11:40.967 --> 11:44.135
I have a, uh...
Veterinary appointment.

11:48.073 --> 11:50.942
What's up?
How you guys doing?

11:51.009 --> 11:53.110
Do you want to split
some mozzarella sticks?

11:53.178 --> 11:54.678
I saw you
on the <i>today</i> show.

11:54.745 --> 11:56.079
Damn it.

11:56.146 --> 11:57.814
I could have sworn you watched
<i>the early show</i> on CBS.

11:57.882 --> 11:59.850
<i>The early show?</i>
What am I, in a hospital?

11:59.918 --> 12:01.252
I'm so sorry, Liz.

12:01.319 --> 12:03.154
You know, I just wanted to tell
you everything face-to-face.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.156
I did not mean for you
to find out about Kaitlin on tv.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.524
Believe me,
if I had a time machine,

12:06.592 --> 12:09.027
I would go back
and do it differently.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.529
You want to split
some mozzarella sticks?

12:10.596 --> 12:11.997
Aagh!
I didn't go back far enough.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.469
Look, I-I want you
to be happy,

12:16.536 --> 12:18.670
And obviously
you have a life to live,

12:18.738 --> 12:21.639
But your getting married
is a big deal to me.

12:21.707 --> 12:24.141
So please, don't do it
where I work.

12:24.209 --> 12:27.511
And don't drag
my best friend, tv, into it.

12:27.578 --> 12:29.279
No, I get it.
I do.

12:29.347 --> 12:30.647
But I'm sorry.
I got to do this.

12:30.714 --> 12:33.082
Look, Kaitlin
is a yogaerobics instructor

12:33.150 --> 12:34.150
And an ab model.

12:34.217 --> 12:35.517
I was in a reenactment

12:35.585 --> 12:37.753
On <i>America's Most Wanted</i> once,

12:37.821 --> 12:41.059
Playing a lady
strangled on the toilet.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.495
We're just hoping
the exposure can help Kaitlin

12:42.563 --> 12:43.731
Get some jobs
here in New York.

12:43.799 --> 12:46.300
Here in New York?
Wow.

12:46.368 --> 12:48.302
Let's just order.

12:48.370 --> 12:50.705
I'm sorry, Liz.
No.

12:50.772 --> 12:53.206
Don't be. It's fine.
High road.

12:53.274 --> 12:55.709
So are you seeing anyone?

12:55.777 --> 12:57.311
You should try
the fish!

13:04.561 --> 13:05.929
What would you like
for dinner, Mr. Jordan--

13:05.996 --> 13:09.769
Barbecue or me?

13:09.837 --> 13:12.943
No!
No!

13:13.011 --> 13:13.979
Are you
all right, Tracy?

13:14.046 --> 13:15.716
I had another
freaky ken-mare.

13:15.784 --> 13:18.456
It's okay.
We're gonna get through this...

13:18.523 --> 13:21.458
Together.

13:21.526 --> 13:25.030
No!

13:27.268 --> 13:30.035
I just had
another Kenneth dream.

13:30.103 --> 13:32.671
Me too. But how do I know
<i>this</i> isn't a dream?

13:32.738 --> 13:34.072
Wait a minute.

13:34.140 --> 13:36.441
All my teeth are loose,
so we're good.

13:36.508 --> 13:37.508
It's real.

13:37.576 --> 13:39.143
Tracy, my dreams
are getting worse.

13:39.211 --> 13:41.746
This one was so graphic.

13:41.814 --> 13:45.416
Kenneth and I were married
and living in Indianapolis.

13:45.484 --> 13:46.684
We had kids.

13:46.752 --> 13:48.986
What kind of sick mind
dreams that?

13:49.054 --> 13:50.754
It was disgusting!

13:50.822 --> 13:52.222
We have to get him
out of our dreams.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.757
We have to go
back to how things were.

13:53.824 --> 13:55.725
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

13:55.793 --> 13:57.093
We have
to <i>Elm Street</i> this.

13:57.161 --> 14:00.196
We have to go to sleep
and kill Kenneth in our dreams.

14:00.264 --> 14:01.697
I don't know
who the hell told you

14:01.765 --> 14:03.732
To say that, rossitano,
but you have no idea--

14:03.800 --> 14:04.933
Twig and plums.

14:07.302 --> 14:10.905
I have to go
to an intervention

14:19.849 --> 14:22.918
So that's
your second salmon.

14:22.985 --> 14:24.052
How are you feeling?

14:24.120 --> 14:25.453
Like a rock star.

14:25.521 --> 14:28.054
Hey, excuse me, can I get
another salmon, compadre?

14:28.122 --> 14:29.623
Sauce on the side

14:29.690 --> 14:31.424
Eating healthy,
'cause I'm marrying a lady

14:31.492 --> 14:33.359

you know, nice and tight.

14:55.782 --> 14:57.616
It's our special sauce
that we put on the salmon.

14:57.684 --> 14:59.718
It's molasses and honey
and Jack Daniels.

14:59.786 --> 15:01.653
It has alcohol in it?
No, no, he doesn't drink.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.721
Oh, don't worry. The alcohol
cooks down with the fish.

15:03.789 --> 15:05.256
But what if you get
the sauce on the side,

15:05.323 --> 15:06.590
And it isn't cooked
with the fish?

15:06.658 --> 15:10.461

Well, we're closed.
Sorry.

15:28.712 --> 15:30.445
No, Floyd, I just wanted you

15:41.164 --> 15:43.131
I thought we cared
about each other.

15:43.199 --> 15:44.265
Yeah, I did too.

15:44.332 --> 15:46.233
I thought the only thing
keeping us apart

15:46.301 --> 15:47.734
Was that you wanted
to live in Cleveland,

15:47.802 --> 15:49.602
But you'll move to New York
for Kaitlin.

15:49.670 --> 15:51.104
Yeah, I will.
You know why?

15:51.171 --> 15:53.306
One, blonde.

15:53.374 --> 15:55.877
Two, she's alive...

15:55.944 --> 15:57.078
Like a deer.

15:57.145 --> 16:00.647
She runs and sniffs
and jumps and stares.

16:00.715 --> 16:02.482
She's not like the badger

16:02.549 --> 16:06.352
With its glasses and its rules
about weekday sex.

16:06.419 --> 16:08.854
Those are good rules.

16:08.921 --> 16:10.757
How are you
still single, Liz?

16:10.824 --> 16:12.725
There's so many guys
out there

16:12.793 --> 16:15.060
That want to be poisoned
and yelled at.

16:16.696 --> 16:19.764
Yeah, well, uh,
have a good night.

16:19.832 --> 16:21.233
Enjoy your salmon.

16:21.300 --> 16:23.334
Salmon for everyone...

16:23.401 --> 16:26.802

16:28.403 --> 16:31.105
This is a dream.

Aah!

16:48.455 --> 16:49.588
It's working.

16:49.655 --> 16:51.555
We've joined forces
in our dreamscape.

16:51.623 --> 16:54.056
Now we fly.

16:54.124 --> 16:56.258
What the hell
are you doing?

16:56.326 --> 16:58.761
Uh, controlling our dreams?

16:58.828 --> 17:00.162
We can explain, Pete.

17:00.230 --> 17:02.030
We were just trying
to <i>Elm Street</i> Kenneth.

17:02.098 --> 17:04.567
Unbelievable. It is
way too early for this, guys.

17:04.634 --> 17:06.569
I haven't even had
my first cup of wine today.

17:06.636 --> 17:09.003
Tracy, it's morning.

17:09.071 --> 17:11.540
We slept all night, and
we didn't dream about Kenneth.

17:11.608 --> 17:13.608
We're cured.
It worked!

17:13.675 --> 17:15.410
It's a miracle.

17:18.145 --> 17:20.412
No, I got
in a lot of writing--

17:25.184 --> 17:27.586
Who's that from?

17:32.593 --> 17:34.194
That's my mom's room.

17:37.832 --> 17:38.899
Hello, Frank.

17:38.967 --> 17:41.535
I think you know
where I am.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.204
I just happened to run
into your mom

17:43.271 --> 17:44.839
At a T.J. Maxx in Queens,

17:44.906 --> 17:47.441
And we came back here
for some cannoli and red wine.

17:47.509 --> 17:50.044
She's a lovely woman.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.547
I'll be leaving soon.
I'm a gentleman...

17:52.614 --> 17:53.915
As is Danny.

17:53.982 --> 17:55.383
Hey, Frank.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.151
Your mom's a hugger.

17:57.219 --> 17:58.720
Don't push me, Frank.

17:58.788 --> 18:01.591
You won't enjoy the next tape.
Your mom might, though.

18:01.658 --> 18:05.228
And I believe toofer and lutz
also have mothers.

18:05.296 --> 18:07.431
Do we understand
each other?

18:07.499 --> 18:10.067
Pranksmen...

18:10.135 --> 18:12.637
Stand down.

18:12.705 --> 18:14.272
You wanted to see me?

18:14.340 --> 18:16.808
Lemon, have you seen
the <i>today</i> show this morning?

18:16.876 --> 18:18.743
Why?
Floyd showed up, right?

18:18.811 --> 18:20.578
Funny you would ask that,
but, yes, he showed up.

18:20.646 --> 18:22.278
The problem is,
he won't leave.

18:22.345 --> 18:24.909
In this hour,
spring cleaning--

18:24.976 --> 18:28.610
Boring! Boring!
Floyd, come on.

18:28.678 --> 18:31.313
Hey, you guys wear
so much makeup, you know that?

18:31.380 --> 18:34.215
You do.
Floyd! Have you been drinking?

18:34.283 --> 18:35.783
Shut up, kit kat!

18:35.851 --> 18:37.417
Vote for Floyd and Kaitlin!

18:37.485 --> 18:38.518
Yeah!

18:38.586 --> 18:43.056
Right?
Oh, God.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.824
Mm.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.291
Ah, false alarm!

18:46.359 --> 18:47.426
Saved it.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.528
All right.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.929
He got drunk
with me last night,

18:49.997 --> 18:51.197
But it was an accident.

18:51.265 --> 18:52.665
And he was being a wang.

18:52.732 --> 18:53.932
I didn't think
he would go on a bender.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.868
Lemon, you have to--
fix this. I know.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.336
This is not--
the high road. I know.

18:57.404 --> 18:58.637
Shut up.

18:58.705 --> 19:01.739
Kaitlin, you have every right
to be furious at me.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.374
What I did
was unconscionable.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.142
And I-I didn't have
a lot of time,

19:05.210 --> 19:06.843
But to make it up to you,
I hope

19:06.911 --> 19:10.113
That you'll accept
these <i>tgs</i> mouse pads

19:10.181 --> 19:13.816
And a man's wallet
with the <i>Dateline</i> logo on it.

19:13.884 --> 19:16.185
I'm not mad, Liz.
This is a relief.

19:16.252 --> 19:18.253
I thought he'd gone
off the wagon 'cause of me.

19:18.321 --> 19:20.955
No. Even drunk, he only had
really nice things

19:21.023 --> 19:23.023
To say about you
and your butt.

19:23.091 --> 19:25.392
God, I don't remember
any of that.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.328
Did I fall down
while I was with you?

19:27.395 --> 19:32.633
'cause my lower back
is killing me.

19:32.701 --> 19:36.035
Oh, boy.
Floyd, I am so sorry.

19:36.103 --> 19:38.037
No, Liz, there's a reason
I quit drinking.

19:38.105 --> 19:40.840
You know, I-I probably
would have left me there too.

19:40.908 --> 19:43.075
I really just want you
to be happy.

19:43.143 --> 19:44.910
You too, Liz Lemon.

19:44.978 --> 19:47.579
So go.

19:47.647 --> 19:50.248
Get married.
Love each other.

19:50.316 --> 19:52.584
And if you go on a cruise
for your honeymoon,

19:52.652 --> 19:54.753
May it be free
of pirates.

19:55.822 --> 19:57.822
Outie 5000.

20:02.428 --> 20:05.430
Liz, look,
well, maybe this is crazy,

20:05.498 --> 20:07.532
But I don't have
any female friends

20:07.600 --> 20:10.235
Because, you know,
my body.

20:10.302 --> 20:11.703
And I was just wondering...

20:11.771 --> 20:13.605
And now I have agreed
to do a reading

20:13.673 --> 20:15.908
From corinthians
at Floyd's wedding.

20:15.975 --> 20:19.678
So instead of avoiding
seeing Floyd getting married...

20:19.746 --> 20:21.246
I'm in the wedding party.

20:21.314 --> 20:22.849
Yeah.

20:26.731 --> 20:28.464
I've had enough
of both of you.

20:28.532 --> 20:30.532
Your bad behavior stops now!

20:30.536 --> 20:32.236
Absolutely, sir.
We promise.

20:32.304 --> 20:35.673
And we are never, never
taking you for granted again.

20:35.740 --> 20:38.976
In fact, we'd like to sing you
a thank-you song.

20:48.353 --> 20:49.820
Thank you, Kenneth.

20:49.887 --> 20:53.089
Oh, I'll show you
how to thank me.
