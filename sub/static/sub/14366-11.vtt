<i>Previously

00:04.128 --> 00:07.696
Simply put, this
combination of elements could allow us

00:07.698 --> 00:11.500
- to cyberform entire worlds.
- Then we will focus

00:11.502 --> 00:16.104
<i>upon the successful reconstruction
of the Omega lock.</i>

00:16.106 --> 00:20.175
<i>Prime!
It's 'Cons again. In progress this time.</i>

00:22.813 --> 00:24.513
<i>Ratchet,</i>

00:24.515 --> 00:28.316
We will be returning with
a Decepticon prisoner.

00:28.318 --> 00:31.453
<i>Why is Megatron stealing
human technology?</i>

00:31.455 --> 00:34.189
<i>What is he attempting to build?</i>

00:34.191 --> 00:37.692
Knockout first procured
this unfinished shamble

00:37.694 --> 00:39.294
from the Autobot medic.

00:42.021 --> 00:44.299
<i>The most efficient means to an end</i>

00:44.301 --> 00:46.301
<i>may be to recruit that medic.</i>

01:19.642 --> 01:21.169
It took a cataclysm

01:21.171 --> 01:24.573
to extinguish Cybertron's
original Predacon inhabitants.

01:24.575 --> 01:27.876
You never stood a
chance against me, Prime.

01:27.878 --> 01:32.881
In fact, the time has
come for your extinction.

<i>sync & correction by f1nc0
Resync by Metal Warrior | addic7ed.com </i>

02:05.381 --> 02:07.782
Permission to hasten
our progress, chief?

02:07.784 --> 02:09.451
Granted.

02:43.854 --> 02:46.922
This is no place for
a one-handed Autobot.

02:48.692 --> 02:52.561
I'll take one bum hand
over one good eye any day.

03:06.510 --> 03:11.710
- Stand down, Predacon.
- I am Predaking

03:11.710 --> 03:14.810
and I will never bow to your kind!

03:29.290 --> 03:30.690
<i>Predaking,</i>

03:30.700 --> 03:34.260
<i>I have been informed that
our objective is at risk.</i>

03:34.270 --> 03:36.800
<i>Secure it. Now.</i>

04:03.848 --> 04:06.130
Commander, objective secured.

04:06.130 --> 04:09.300
Now might be a fine time for surrender.

04:09.300 --> 04:13.970
A logical assumption, were it not for...

05:16.070 --> 05:19.770
<i>Ratchet, we require immediate
transport back to base.</i>

05:19.770 --> 05:21.400
Huh?

05:21.410 --> 05:24.870
Stewardess, there's a man
on the wing of this plane!

05:26.230 --> 05:28.340
<i>Ratchet, do you read?</i>

05:30.180 --> 05:31.180
Arcee...?

05:31.180 --> 05:37.020
<i>Bulkhead? Is everything all right?
Where's Ratchet?</i>

05:40.120 --> 05:43.260
<i>He's... he's gone.</i>

05:56.270 --> 06:00.280
- What do you want from me?
- Your assistance, actually.

06:00.280 --> 06:05.310
To help complete a
little... science project.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.950
I will never cooperate.

06:07.950 --> 06:11.750
Shockwave does not
require your cooperation

06:11.760 --> 06:15.860
to siphon your knowledge, Doctor.

06:21.830 --> 06:24.130
<i>Peeled some paint off Laserbeak.</i>

06:24.140 --> 06:26.900
But if I were a better shot,
Ratchet would still be here.

06:26.910 --> 06:30.240
Chin up, soldier. We've
combed the entire floor.

06:30.240 --> 06:33.110
For the moment, that
remains our only clue.

06:33.110 --> 06:34.980
Nothing in the groundbridge log.

06:34.980 --> 06:38.820
If they bridged Ratchet out of here,
they used theirs, not ours.

06:38.820 --> 06:42.250
Why take Ratchet prisoner,
but leave these two behind?

06:42.250 --> 06:45.190
If Megatron intends to
hold our medic hostage,

06:45.190 --> 06:47.760
I find it curious that
he's made no demands.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.520
It would stand to reason

06:49.520 --> 06:54.260
that Ratchet must possess something
the Decepticons want.

06:54.270 --> 06:59.100
Well, whatever the 'Cons are after,
Ratch won't give it up. Right?

07:03.840 --> 07:07.940
<i>Lord Megatron, I understand
that you have brought</i>

07:07.950 --> 07:10.110
<i>an accursed Autobot aboard this warship.</i>

07:10.120 --> 07:11.980
Indeed.

07:11.980 --> 07:16.790
Then I will accomplish with him
what I failed to with the Prime.

07:16.790 --> 07:21.020
Predaking, this Autobot
is more than a prisoner.

07:21.030 --> 07:25.360
You do wish for Cybertron's
restoration, do you not?

07:27.200 --> 07:31.930
Our captive's usefulness
will come to an end.

07:31.940 --> 07:37.820
And when that time arrives,
I assure you, he will be all yours.

07:42.180 --> 07:45.480
Listen, I need 24/7
satellite monitoring.

07:45.480 --> 07:49.020
Eyes on the skies and
ears to the ground!

07:49.020 --> 07:52.560
Maybe buckethead's
after the techno-babble.

07:54.830 --> 07:56.330
The Synth-En formula?

07:56.330 --> 07:58.560
Why would the 'Cons
need the artificial stuff

07:58.560 --> 08:01.500
if they already control most of
this planet's Energon reserves?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.500
Greed, what else?

08:03.500 --> 08:08.500
If Megatron is truly rebuilding
the Omega lock, as Ratchet surmised,

08:08.510 --> 08:12.380
Synthetic Energon might
be a necessary component.

08:12.380 --> 08:15.410
<i>I hate to be the one to bring
lightning to a thunderstorm,</i>

08:15.410 --> 08:17.380
but there's one thing
we're all ignoring.

08:17.380 --> 08:21.380
If the 'Cons found Ratchet here,
they know the location of this base.

08:31.900 --> 08:36.000
<i>And what did the
cortical psychic patch yield? </i>

08:38.100 --> 08:40.840
Only confirmation that the
synthetic Energon formula

08:40.840 --> 08:45.240
is unstable, and that the Autobot
medic's work on it remains incomplete.

08:45.240 --> 08:50.950
Then it seems we must help
Ratchet finish his work.

08:58.690 --> 09:01.960
Are you through poking
around inside my head?

09:01.960 --> 09:04.330
You didn't find what
you wanted, did you?

09:04.330 --> 09:06.900
Or else you wouldn't be here.

09:06.900 --> 09:11.770
What I want apparently
does not yet exist.

09:11.770 --> 09:13.570
And that would be...?

09:13.570 --> 09:16.610
We would very much like for
you to complete your work

09:16.610 --> 09:20.280
on the formula for synthetic Energon.

09:20.280 --> 09:24.150
Even if I were capable, do
you think that I would hand you

09:24.150 --> 09:27.220
a limitless supply of fuel
and ammunition just so you can

09:27.220 --> 09:30.220
turn around and use it
against the Autobots?

09:30.220 --> 09:33.360
Oh, you misunderstand, dearest Ratchet.

09:33.360 --> 09:37.960
I intend to use your formula
for the purpose of creation,

09:37.960 --> 09:40.360
not destruction.

09:42.030 --> 09:46.100
We have fortuitously
discovered that your Synth-En,

09:46.100 --> 09:49.040
When combined with cyber-nucleic acid,

09:49.040 --> 09:53.040
may in fact form the basis for
an alternative cyber-matter.

09:53.040 --> 09:56.980
You are attempting to
rebuild the Omega lock.

09:56.980 --> 10:01.850
We stand on the verge of a
great moment in time, you and I.

10:01.850 --> 10:06.660
The restoration of our very homeworld.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.490
Collaborate with the barbarian

10:08.490 --> 10:12.290
who essentially destroyed
our planet in the first place?

10:12.300 --> 10:15.760
Who sadistically crushed
Bumblebee's voice box

10:15.770 --> 10:18.680
while looking him in the eye?

10:18.680 --> 10:23.040
- No, thank you.
- Then I present you with a choice:

10:23.040 --> 10:27.210
Complete your research, or...

10:33.530 --> 10:36.430
Humans, always the weak link.

10:36.790 --> 10:42.090
Are these humans supposed
to mean something to me?

10:42.090 --> 10:45.960
If not, I am certain this will.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.770
<i>As you must certainly be aware,</i>

10:49.770 --> 10:52.900
<i>we know the location
of your current base.</i>

10:52.900 --> 10:55.440
Accept my offer, and I will allow

10:55.440 --> 11:01.040
your fellow Autobots and
human pets to remain unharmed.

11:01.050 --> 11:04.780
Think it over, good Doctor.

11:16.860 --> 11:20.430
My liege, you aren't really
going to allow the Autobots

11:20.430 --> 11:24.200
- to remain operational?
- Of course not.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.000
Assemble your armada, Starscream,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.240
and decimate their base once again.

11:35.980 --> 11:38.880
All aerial search patterns
are coming up empty.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.720
No comm-link chatter either.

11:40.720 --> 11:45.950
And no ground activity.
It's a little too quiet out there.

11:45.960 --> 11:49.730
Since the Decepticons no
longer seek Predacon bones

11:49.730 --> 11:54.360
or Earth technology, there
is no activity to track.

11:54.360 --> 11:58.430
So until Megatron makes a move,
we're in a holding pattern.

11:58.440 --> 12:03.810
Ratchet didn't think this new hand
he built for me was good enough.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.940
But I'll tell you what
truly isn't good enough:

12:07.240 --> 12:09.810
giving up.

12:09.810 --> 12:12.380
We have no choice but
to play this old school,

12:12.380 --> 12:15.180
split into teams,
for maximum coverage.

12:15.190 --> 12:18.790
We have incoming.
A whole fleet's worth.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.780
<i>Concentrate your fire on hangar E.</i>

12:51.920 --> 12:55.190
Air cover's holding. For the moment.

13:19.420 --> 13:23.150
Lord Megatron, I am pleased to report

13:23.150 --> 13:28.190
<i>that the Autobot base
has been reduced to ashes.</i>

13:37.004 --> 13:39.400
The mess hall sure is a mess.

13:39.400 --> 13:44.310
We are fortunate that Decepticons
can be fooled by a simple paint job.

14:09.060 --> 14:12.170
<i>I'm sure you would
more fully appreciate a tour</i>

14:12.170 --> 14:15.440
of our facilities if
you were comfortable.

14:18.310 --> 14:22.910
How do you know I won't
use these to amputate?

14:22.910 --> 14:27.550
And pass up a chance to see
our molecular masking field?

14:27.550 --> 14:29.920
Your cloaking device.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.930
Shielding is shielding,
high tech or low.

14:39.930 --> 14:45.570
Perhaps you'll be more impressed
by our Energon transfusion capacitor.

14:45.570 --> 14:50.070
It allows us to maximize our
consumption a thousand-fold.

14:50.070 --> 14:53.570
Decepticon engineering
never fails to impress.

14:53.580 --> 14:57.410
Doctor, we may be mortal enemies,

14:57.410 --> 15:01.980
but Autobots and Decepticons
do share one common goal.

15:01.980 --> 15:05.520
You would like to see the ruins
of our devastated homeworld

15:05.520 --> 15:10.620
restored to their former brilliance,
as would I.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.440
Megatron, you would just try to
conquer Cybertron all over again,

15:21.440 --> 15:24.410
and enslave anyone who refuses
to pledge allegiance to you.

15:24.410 --> 15:26.940
Of course I would!

15:26.940 --> 15:30.240
And your comrades would
attempt to stop me, as ever.

15:30.250 --> 15:33.280
But at least we would
once again possess a planet

15:33.280 --> 15:34.950
worth fighting over.

15:34.950 --> 15:38.220
Perhaps, but you wouldn't
stop there, would you?

15:38.220 --> 15:41.290
Earth would be next, if not first.

15:41.290 --> 15:45.660
What assurance do I have that
you would leave humankind be?

15:45.660 --> 15:48.100
And that you wouldn't
instantly terminate me

15:48.100 --> 15:52.200
- once you get what you need?
- None whatsoever.

15:52.200 --> 15:56.700
After all, we both know
that as a Decepticon,

15:56.710 --> 16:01.610
any assurances I might
offer would be worthless.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.750
But that does not change the fact

16:05.750 --> 16:11.650
that you may be Cybertron's only
hope of ever seeing life again.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.990
So the kid clipped the business
end of Laserbeak's transponder.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.100
You're not such a bad shot after all.

16:25.670 --> 16:28.670
We thought you might be the
best one to provide an analysis,

16:28.670 --> 16:30.600
in Ratchet's absence.

16:30.610 --> 16:33.170
It's trying to communicate
with the warship.

16:33.180 --> 16:36.110
- How do you know?
- It's telling us.

16:37.650 --> 16:41.150
Uh, Raf, that's Cybertronian code.

16:41.150 --> 16:45.790
Wait, first Raf understands Bumblebee,
now he reads Cybertronian?

16:45.790 --> 16:48.560
Are we sure he's not some kind of alien?

16:48.560 --> 16:52.090
I've been learning for
a while, in between stuff

16:52.090 --> 16:55.700
when Ratchet had time to teach me.

16:55.700 --> 17:01.400
- Hey, Raf, we'll bring him back.
- If it's the last thing we do.

17:01.400 --> 17:05.210
If it's talking to its momma
can we triangulate the signal?

17:05.210 --> 17:07.270
To a shielded warship?

17:07.280 --> 17:10.540
If the transponder were still attached
to Laserbeak, we could follow it.

17:10.550 --> 17:14.150
Maybe we should give it wings.

17:14.150 --> 17:16.319
We can use spare parts
from the machine shop.

17:16.319 --> 17:19.450
Then let's do it, for the Doc.

17:20.819 --> 17:25.089
While your forces have put
a dent in our resources,

17:25.089 --> 17:29.100
Shockwave has been invaluable
in updating our laboratory.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.770
Should you choose to accept the task,

17:31.770 --> 17:37.100
you shall have unrestricted
access to our equipment.

17:37.110 --> 17:41.640
Is that a quantum cryo-inducer?
Only two were ever made.

17:41.640 --> 17:48.520
Three, actually.
You are holding the original prototype.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.620
The frequency modulator
keeps shorting out!

17:56.630 --> 18:00.230
Easy, champ. Let me try
uncrossing some wires.

18:00.230 --> 18:02.530
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

18:02.530 --> 18:04.800
Jackie wasn't always a loner, you know.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.300
Being a Wrecker was all about the team.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.700
<i> Yip-ip-ip-ip!</i>

18:09.710 --> 18:12.640
Miko! I needed that!

18:12.640 --> 18:15.510
I was just trying to
tighten up that thingamajig.

18:15.510 --> 18:17.740
Pfff! Please!

18:19.510 --> 18:22.820
Agent Fowler.
Everything all right?

18:22.820 --> 18:25.790
Just preoccupied. Thinking
about the close calls

18:25.790 --> 18:28.190
we humans have had
with the 'Cons lately.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.790
Smacked down by Soundwave,

18:29.790 --> 18:32.390
stuck in Knockout's
trunk with your mom.

18:32.390 --> 18:36.560
- Moving on...
- The uncomfortable reality is,

18:36.570 --> 18:38.630
the 'Bots might not always be here.

18:38.630 --> 18:43.270
And even if they are, they can't be
everywhere at once, as we've learned.

18:43.270 --> 18:47.410
This armor is the only thing that
stood between Miko and that Predacon.

18:47.410 --> 18:49.680
The reason she came
back without a scratch.

18:49.680 --> 18:52.450
Cyber-tech like that
could be just what we need

18:52.450 --> 18:55.480
to give our agents on the
front lines a fighting chance.

18:55.480 --> 18:58.720
Agents like, maybe you someday.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.420
- What?!
- You'll be of age soon,

19:01.420 --> 19:04.190
and you're Prime material, son.

19:04.190 --> 19:06.560
Your mom thought you
might be a good fit,

19:06.560 --> 19:09.760
seeing as you've been
wishy-washy about future plans.

19:09.770 --> 19:13.530
Wait, you've been talking
to my mom? About me?

19:19.440 --> 19:20.710
Custer's mustache!

19:33.320 --> 19:35.290
Sorry, Agent Fowler.

19:35.290 --> 19:38.660
I think I need to change
my star-spangled shorts.

19:38.660 --> 19:42.800
- I'm still fine-tuning chip's remote.
- Chip?

19:42.800 --> 19:46.430
So we're gonna let this doohickey
fly back to 'Con central...

19:46.440 --> 19:48.240
And lead us right to Ratchet.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.910
Even if you manage to
reconstruct the Omega lock,

19:53.910 --> 19:58.450
it is a mystic force.
I've come to my senses.

19:58.450 --> 20:01.880
The notion of scientifically
replicating its capability

20:01.880 --> 20:04.790
is pure folly. Madness, even.

20:07.890 --> 20:10.860
But how will we ever know
for certain, Doctor...

20:12.560 --> 20:15.530
...if we do not try?

20:21.770 --> 20:23.670
<i>And how can we not try,</i>

20:23.670 --> 20:26.440
<i>when the means finally
lie within our reach?</i>

20:51.570 --> 20:55.440
By the Allspark,
you've actually done it.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.870
Decepticon engineering.

20:57.870 --> 21:02.480
It will not take long for this Omega
lock's drives to be fully operational.

21:02.480 --> 21:05.550
All that is still needed
to restore our home

21:05.550 --> 21:08.880
is the cyber-matter
to launch through it.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.720
Which requires a stabilized formula

21:11.720 --> 21:14.350
for the production of synthetic Energon.

21:14.360 --> 21:18.030
I have every confidence in you, Doctor.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.170
I'll do it.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.900
But then you already
knew that, didn't you?
