00:02.540 --> 00:04.326
Nova, we cant just
sit on this.

00:04.380 --> 00:07.031
Families are being kicked out
of their homes as we speak.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.489
Maybe I could keep Blue
more often.

00:08.550 --> 00:11.007
-We got to take it slow.
-How slow?

00:11.050 --> 00:13.211
Last year,
I was diagnosed with lupus,

00:13.260 --> 00:16.297
but Im going to do everything
for it to not interfere
with our business.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.217
[Nova]
So youre going to run yourself
into the ground, like Daddy.

00:19.270 --> 00:23.058
Daddy was so busy
trying to hide his pain.
It damn near broke him.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.931
[Malik] You need to grab
peoples attention,

00:24.980 --> 00:26.857
because if they cant respect
our history,

00:26.900 --> 00:29.562
-they cant have our history.
-Micah, you in?

00:29.610 --> 00:30.565
Im in.

[Ralph Angel]
Man.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.618
[Trinh]
My mom and a bunch of her
friends in the neighborhood

00:36.660 --> 00:38.196
started this one.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.447
[Ralph Angel] Bet I could learn
a thing or two.

00:41.830 --> 00:43.115
[Ralph Angel]
Oh, yeah?

00:43.160 --> 00:44.957
[Trinh] Those ladies have
some serious skills.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.740
[Ralph Angel] I didnt know
Mrs. Phan was into farming.

00:46.790 --> 00:47.950
[Trinh]
Oh, yeah.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.039
And on top of everything,

00:52.090 --> 00:54.217
raising my brother and me,

00:54.260 --> 00:56.216
repairing the community.

00:56.260 --> 00:59.639
They saved every penny
to send me to private college.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.422
Ma even took second jobs
to make it happen.

01:03.890 --> 01:06.017
So theyre doing
the same thing for Khanh.

01:07.650 --> 01:11.188
He wants to study engineering
in Houston next year.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.236
I didnt know
he was leaving.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.601
In the fall, yeah.

01:17.910 --> 01:20.151
Sound a lot
like my pop.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.498
Struggled on the farm
a lot last year.

01:24.210 --> 01:29.705
Worked a bunch of odd jobs
just to help me and Blue.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.160
Yeah.

01:34.510 --> 01:38.139
I can only imagine
a parent would do anything

01:38.180 --> 01:41.968
to protect and provide
for their child.

01:42.010 --> 01:44.592
-Yeah.
-No matter what it takes.

01:46.060 --> 01:47.687
Yeah.

01:49.190 --> 01:51.567
Everythings okay
with Darla?

01:53.480 --> 01:55.892
Yeah.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.736

01:59.700 --> 02:01.236

02:02.830 --> 02:04.036
[laughs]

02:04.080 --> 02:06.366
Um...

02:06.410 --> 02:08.287
I was thinking maybe...

02:08.330 --> 02:11.629
we could be like
a thing or something?

02:11.670 --> 02:12.876
More than work friends?

02:12.920 --> 02:14.330
[laughs]

02:16.470 --> 02:18.256
Yeah.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.177

03:04.600 --> 03:06.716
Were not selling our land.

they can just take it.

03:10.810 --> 03:12.858
Happened to a private port
few years back.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.185
And I can only imagine
how many judges

03:16.230 --> 03:19.779
are taking kickbacks
from the Landrys.

03:19.820 --> 03:21.560
This family,

03:21.610 --> 03:24.408
they cheat and steal
and bleed black people dry.

03:24.450 --> 03:26.281
They take everything.

03:27.830 --> 03:31.493
And Ill be damned ifI sit by
while they do it again.

03:33.290 --> 03:35.588
Im happy to provide

the time comes.

03:37.670 --> 03:38.830

03:38.880 --> 03:41.178
But I appreciate it.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.790

[cell phone rings]

03:53.190 --> 03:54.930

for a sit-down

-Bye, Jacob.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.526

to sit down

04:11.290 --> 04:14.282

to the jail.

04:22.340 --> 04:25.332

04:25.390 --> 04:28.348
Hear my mother out.

04:28.390 --> 04:30.711
Were not who you think.

04:34.730 --> 04:36.300
-Thank you.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.180

after the festival.

04:38.230 --> 04:39.936
Well, that was the plan.

Dave Eggers was In town.

Its just that if were going

[Ralph Angel]
Does that mean youre going
to have Blue 70% of the time?

08:11.780 --> 08:14.863
We would alternate holidays.

08:14.910 --> 08:19.404
And we would decide
if you want weekends

08:19.450 --> 08:21.406
or two on, one off.

12:16.980 --> 12:19.813
walking down the aisle
in a pretty dress.

12:21.530 --> 12:23.737
But I love it.

12:23.780 --> 12:26.692
Hollywood,
its beautiful.

12:26.740 --> 12:28.071
Thank God.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.998
Because I done already
put down a deposit.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.905
[both laugh]

12:32.960 --> 12:34.609
Of course you did.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.911
You are impossible,
you know that?

12:38.460 --> 12:39.870
[Hollywood]
Get a little Italian man

12:39.920 --> 12:41.251
playing a little flute
or something.

12:41.300 --> 12:42.665
[both laugh]

12:49.310 --> 12:51.096
[Asha]
This is what I got.

12:51.140 --> 12:54.598
I went to four different stores
so no one would get SUSplClOUS.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.096
Put this on your front page.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.607
No, listen,
this aint about the fanfare.

12:58.650 --> 13:00.470
This is about the act.
Twelve minutes.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.145
No messing around,
no foolishness.

13:02.190 --> 13:03.771
You know, KJ and I
got the paint,

13:03.820 --> 13:05.651
Asha on tagging.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.270
You know, well stick
to the game plan.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.868
We doing this.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.337
Lets do this, bro.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.660
[Malik]
Here you go.

13:26.590 --> 13:28.342
All right, thanks.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.475
You like the one
with hazelnuts?

13:36.520 --> 13:38.181
Mm-hmm.

13:38.230 --> 13:40.061
But the white chocolate
with the strawberry filling

13:40.110 --> 13:42.567
and the cream cheese,
now thats the one.

13:42.610 --> 13:44.771
So now how many of those
you going to sample?

13:44.820 --> 13:46.811
Im going to sample
all of them.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.316
-[laughs]
-We taste our wedding cake

13:48.370 --> 13:51.157
and celebrating
your pie store opening.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.115
I owe you an apology.

13:59.460 --> 14:00.745
For what?

14:00.790 --> 14:02.542
You aint did
nothing to me.

14:05.550 --> 14:08.087
Back when you were
talking about investing

14:08.130 --> 14:11.008
in Rondels barbershop,

14:11.050 --> 14:12.677
I teased you.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.632
Said you just wanted
to spend all your money.

14:17.060 --> 14:18.436
That was wrong
of me to say.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.186
So I should invest
with Rondel?

14:20.230 --> 14:22.562
-Hell no.
-[both laugh]

14:22.610 --> 14:25.317
Because Rondel
is horrible with money.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.403
But I shouldve asked you
what your dream is.

14:30.450 --> 14:32.657
Baby, this right here
is my dream.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.157
Taking care of you.
Thats my dream.

14:35.200 --> 14:41.537
Yeah, well, I want you
to think about yourself, too.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.034
I think about myself.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.046
No, you dont.

14:45.090 --> 14:47.046
Folks like us,

14:47.090 --> 14:49.877
we get so used
to working all our lives

14:49.930 --> 14:52.387
just getting by,

14:52.430 --> 14:55.012
we dont know what to do
when getting by

14:55.060 --> 14:57.267
aint our everyday
no more.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.096
So...

15:02.520 --> 15:05.102
whats your dream,
black man?

15:15.370 --> 15:19.955
I always thought about having
my own construction company.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.247
When I was in college...

15:23.290 --> 15:25.292
I thought about having
a sports lounge.

15:25.340 --> 15:27.126
Thought thatd be real cool.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.335
You never
told me that.

15:30.380 --> 15:31.836
[laughs]

15:31.890 --> 15:34.632
Okay, so I dont know
what a sports lounge is...

15:34.680 --> 15:36.966
[both laugh]

15:39.640 --> 15:43.053
But if those are things
you want to do,

15:43.100 --> 15:45.068
you should do it.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.526
I got one question.

15:48.570 --> 15:52.358
Lets say I do what you say
and started getting busy,

15:52.410 --> 15:54.901
will you do what you
supposed to do

15:54.950 --> 15:56.656
and take care of yourself?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.400
I promise.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.336
The chocolate
is really good.

16:09.380 --> 16:12.087
[Frances] I was surprised
you agreed to meet.

16:12.130 --> 16:14.007
I was surprised, too.

16:14.050 --> 16:17.099
But Im learning
thats what life is full of.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.221
Surprises.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.187
[Frances]
You are what I hear you are.

16:23.230 --> 16:24.515
[Charley]
And what is that?

16:24.560 --> 16:26.516
Smart. Tough.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.686
My kind of girl.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.447
Im not your girl.
Why am I here?

16:37.120 --> 16:40.032
To help me wipe that smug grin
off my brothers face

16:40.080 --> 16:43.038
and take control
of Landry Enterprises.

16:44.750 --> 16:48.834
Sam has run our familys legacy
into the ground for long enough.

16:48.880 --> 16:53.374
Im sure youre well aware of
our companys financial issues.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.330
I need him out.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.381
You can help me do that.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.341
And why would I trust you?

17:02.890 --> 17:04.972
I love my brother.

17:05.020 --> 17:09.138
Its just that I love
our family land more.

17:09.190 --> 17:12.603
The day I let Sam
contaminate our land

17:12.650 --> 17:16.438
by housing criminals, thugs,
murderers and thieves

17:16.490 --> 17:19.698
is the day our father
turns in his grave.

17:21.660 --> 17:23.036
Criminals and thugs?

17:23.080 --> 17:25.822
You sound like
your brother.

17:25.870 --> 17:29.089
What difference does it make
what I sound like

17:29.130 --> 17:32.452
as long as we both want
the same thing?

17:32.510 --> 17:34.967
[cell phone rings]

17:36.720 --> 17:37.960
Think on that.

17:38.010 --> 17:40.092
Excuse me,
Ill be right back.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.686
Cant speak in front of mama?

17:52.730 --> 17:53.890
I know what you
think of me.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.192
You overestimate yourself.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.447
I dont think of you
at all.

18:01.370 --> 18:02.780
Im sorry.

18:02.830 --> 18:05.242
Truly, Im sorry.

18:05.290 --> 18:07.997
But withholding the truth
about Sams plans

18:12.090 --> 18:14.911
I didnt lie
about me and you.

18:19.510 --> 18:21.341
[Frances]
Sorry about that.

18:23.220 --> 18:26.804
I want to talk to you about
brothers and sisters, Charley.

18:26.850 --> 18:29.091
About men and women.

18:30.360 --> 18:34.399
While Sam was spreading
his oats,

18:34.440 --> 18:39.605
my father leaned on me
to help him do everything.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.902
But he still left more
of the company to Sam than me.

18:42.950 --> 18:44.941
Its a familiar story,
isnt it?

18:46.290 --> 18:49.032
But if were in
that boardroom together

18:49.080 --> 18:51.207
we can combine ou_r_votes
and stop that Jail

18:51.250 --> 18:53.241
from ever breaking ground.

18:53.290 --> 18:56.009
We can stop it before it ever
gets to the Parish Council vote.

18:57.510 --> 18:59.580
Even with me,

18:59.630 --> 19:03.259
you still dont have
enough shares to override Sam.

19:03.300 --> 19:06.428
Were working on that.

19:06.470 --> 19:10.304
But I need to know
we have an understanding.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.778
I understand that anyone
whos willing to betray

19:17.820 --> 19:19.731
their own flesh and blood

19:19.780 --> 19:21.941
is someone I need
to be wary of.

19:21.990 --> 19:24.527
Maybe thats how
you treat family,

19:24.580 --> 19:26.116
but we dont do that.

19:28.790 --> 19:30.280
I had no choice.

19:32.580 --> 19:34.241
If we dont partner,

19:34.290 --> 19:37.088
the best you can do
is hold things up in the courts.

19:37.130 --> 19:39.507
But in the end,
Sam still wins.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.137
You might find this
of interest.

19:44.180 --> 19:47.172
Everything you need to know
about my nephew, Colton.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.727
Company bylaws dont let family
poach other family shares.

19:53.770 --> 19:57.149
But.. you can.

20:01.610 --> 20:02.941
Ill leave it at that.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.290
[laughs]
Hey.

20:19.340 --> 20:20.876
Im talking to you.
You okay?

20:20.920 --> 20:23.172
Stop it, you throwing
my game off.

20:23.220 --> 20:24.881
Im just checking
on you.

20:26.260 --> 20:27.887
Whats going on here?
Give me this.

20:27.930 --> 20:29.420
-Give me this. Give me this.
-Uh-uh!

20:29.470 --> 20:30.880
-What you doing?
-You struggling here.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.431
You over_ here
struggling.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.016
[scoffs]

20:35.150 --> 20:36.799
Back in high school,

20:36.860 --> 20:39.317
I mightve had
some skills.

20:47.740 --> 20:49.071
Maam.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.456
Done.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.660
[lighter clatters]

20:57.000 --> 20:58.376
Who are you?

20:58.420 --> 20:59.739
[laughs]

20:59.800 --> 21:02.166
I almost flunked out
of geometry

21:02.220 --> 21:04.791
because my skills
were so good.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.967
-You was a regular rebel.
-Mm.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.630
Served a week
in detention

21:10.680 --> 21:12.978
after me and Jermaine Russell
got Into It

21:13.020 --> 21:14.726
over Angelique Morris.

21:14.770 --> 21:16.226
Angelique Morris, huh?

21:16.270 --> 21:17.931
[laughs]

21:19.190 --> 21:21.067
That girl was fine.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.231
Suspension junior year

21:26.280 --> 21:28.828
after I knocked Elijah Shaw out
dunnglunch.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.940
In front of everyone,
mind you.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.366
-No.
-Mm-hmm.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.377
Then senior year
rolls around,

21:37.420 --> 21:42.619
and_I realize Im never
getting out of DetrOIt...

21:44.130 --> 21:45.427
because I keep parking
my behind

21:45.470 --> 21:47.256
in the principals office.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.381
Realized I was just...

21:52.770 --> 21:54.010
mad.

21:54.060 --> 21:55.379
You know?

21:59.020 --> 22:03.184
Just angry at the world
back then.

22:10.200 --> 22:13.158
So I picked myself up...

22:15.200 --> 22:18.613
barely got into college
down here.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.160
Got my mind right.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.581
Found my people.

22:25.340 --> 22:26.500
Purpose.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.209
A lot like you.

22:32.510 --> 22:34.512
Well, arent you a mystery.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.262
Believe it.

22:38.310 --> 22:40.892
Just figured you for some
scrawny-ass math geek.

22:40.940 --> 22:44.023
Mm!

22:44.070 --> 22:45.389
Scrawny geek, huh?

22:49.860 --> 22:52.363
You figured wrong, girl.

22:54.950 --> 22:57.077
Hmm.

23:05.800 --> 23:09.292
One of my favorite
Fantasies

23:14.220 --> 23:16.427
But the city

23:16.470 --> 23:21.339
Always takes you

23:22.690 --> 23:26.353
Away from me

23:30.910 --> 23:32.730
Oh

23:34.410 --> 23:39.495
You hold the key
To my heart

23:39.540 --> 23:43.704
But why you keep
Losing it?

23:55.050 --> 23:56.506
[Charley]
I hate to say this,

23:56.560 --> 23:57.800
but what if they
force the results

23:57.850 --> 23:59.420
of that paternity test?

23:59.480 --> 24:01.687
I know you said that youre on
the birth certificate,

24:01.730 --> 24:03.049
but I dont know--

24:03.100 --> 24:04.260
Shes already
playing dirty, Rah.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.358
You dont got to be blood.

24:13.570 --> 24:15.652
Whats the word
on early parole?

24:15.700 --> 24:17.611
Supposed to get off
in a month.

24:17.660 --> 24:20.197
[Nova]
Thats good. Thatll help.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.571
They can still use
Rahs prison history.

24:25.380 --> 24:28.417
I already missed four years
of his life in prison.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.712
First day of school.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.296
Birthdays.

24:36.890 --> 24:38.380
His first haircut.

24:38.430 --> 24:40.512
I aint get to see that.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.392
Now she want
to take more away?

24:44.440 --> 24:46.647
I cant miss no more.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.232
I cant miss no more.
I want to be there.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.895
Try and be there for him.

24:52.950 --> 24:56.272
That bike, Wood just took
the wheels off of them,

24:56.320 --> 24:58.026
trying to show him
how to ride it.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.651
I didnt even
get a chance to.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.328
Shes trying to take him
from me already.

25:04.790 --> 25:08.578
Shes not going to take
any of those things.

25:08.630 --> 25:10.120
Yeah, but...

25:12.920 --> 25:15.081
what if...

25:15.130 --> 25:16.791
what if he want
to live there?

25:18.510 --> 25:21.388
She got all them new
fancy things and whatnot.

25:21.430 --> 25:24.809
Well, what if Blue dont want
to be with me?

25:24.850 --> 25:27.262
You will always be that little
boys everything.

25:27.310 --> 25:30.188
And no one
can replace that.

25:30.230 --> 25:32.232
No one.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.443
Ive been trying to take
the straight line,

25:35.490 --> 25:39.324
but it seems like somethings
always trying

25:39.370 --> 25:41.440
to just knock me off.

25:41.490 --> 25:44.994
[Nova]
That somethings going to have
to knock all of us down.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.359
We got you.

25:46.420 --> 25:47.739
No matter what.

25:49.340 --> 25:52.377
We will fight like hell
for you and Blue.

25:52.420 --> 25:54.331
[Nova]
Were family.

25:57.090 --> 25:58.637
I got to get going.

26:04.520 --> 26:07.227
[door opens and closes]

26:17.950 --> 26:21.659
So a good friend has agreed
to come down and represent Rah.

26:21.700 --> 26:23.998
Shes... well, shes the best
money can buy.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.655

26:25.710 --> 26:26.859
Thats great.

at your house.

26:32.670 --> 26:36.549

for a housewarming.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.842
Hey, are you okay?

26:40.890 --> 26:43.347

26:43.390 --> 26:45.881
Everythings good.
Its just...

26:51.230 --> 26:53.516
Please dont hate me.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.891
I could never
hate you, Nova.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.736
Whats going on?

27:02.580 --> 27:04.946
I didnt tell you
the truth

27:04.990 --> 27:07.072
when you asked
ifI was seeing someone.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.953
I am seeing someone.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.582
Well, thats great,
isnt it?

27:16.130 --> 27:17.666
Whos the lucky guy?

27:17.720 --> 27:19.256
Or is it a girl?

27:19.300 --> 27:20.676
[laughs]

27:20.720 --> 27:22.927
I need you to know
this wasnt planned.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.512
Its not something I...

27:31.900 --> 27:35.779
Weve been spending
time together...

27:39.070 --> 27:41.812
and never in a million years
did I think this would happen.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.270
You got to trust me.

27:44.620 --> 27:46.861
It wasnt supposed
to happen.

27:46.910 --> 27:48.320
It just...

27:53.080 --> 27:54.456
Just say it.

28:02.470 --> 28:04.290
Remy and I...

28:06.310 --> 28:07.800
we kissed.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.391
It was innocent.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.351
Unexpected.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.811
I know.

28:22.860 --> 28:24.657
I shouldve
said something.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.860
You lied to me for weeks...

28:36.540 --> 28:38.337
or however long
this has been going on.

28:38.380 --> 28:40.757
Im trying my best
to do this right.

28:50.220 --> 28:51.551
Im sorry.

29:02.530 --> 29:04.566
When I told you
about the mill...

29:07.910 --> 29:10.231
you let me know
how wrong I was.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.609
I know.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.859
You were unrelenting.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.371
-I know.
-It wasnt the first time.

29:20.340 --> 29:23.548
But it will be the last.

29:23.590 --> 29:25.000
I didnt ask for this.

29:25.050 --> 29:27.041
You didnt walk away,
either.

29:30.430 --> 29:31.761
I will.

29:33.060 --> 29:35.096
I will if you want me to.

29:44.570 --> 29:46.401
Somehow

29:46.450 --> 29:51.069
I need to be found

29:53.540 --> 29:55.076

30:17.480 --> 30:21.439
Where I stray
In the wilderness

30:21.480 --> 30:24.529
I felt thee

30:24.570 --> 30:27.903
To abide in your love

30:29.450 --> 30:32.908
Let it be, let it be

30:32.950 --> 30:37.956
When the desert sits dry
On the mountain

30:39.540 --> 30:41.030
For the ancestors,

30:41.090 --> 30:44.582
whose bodies and lives
were stolen.

30:44.630 --> 30:47.679
whose hands bled
in the fields.

30:47.720 --> 30:51.042
For those brothers_and sisters
they locked up In cages,

30:51.100 --> 30:53.591
who were shot
in their backs.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.596
For those who marched for us
in the streets.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.016
[Ant]
For the ones still locked up.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.805

32:27.780 --> 32:29.771
I am so sorry.

32:29.820 --> 32:31.697
If you came
to the front door,

32:31.740 --> 32:35.119
that conversation with my dad
is a whole other thing.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.230
Hey.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.615
Everything okay?

32:44.830 --> 32:46.661
Everything with Darla...

32:48.800 --> 32:52.042
she trying to take Blue

32:52.090 --> 32:53.921
She cant do that, right?

32:53.970 --> 32:56.382
-I mean, hes your son.
-Its complicated.

32:56.430 --> 32:58.216
Youve been taking care of him

good thing I got.

33:16.410 --> 33:17.946
See, I just...

33:19.450 --> 33:21.190
I just think we keep it
simple for now.

33:21.250 --> 33:22.990
So...

33:27.210 --> 33:29.747
No, I get it.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.291
-Its just complicated--
-No.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.427
So, I didnt want
to send this

34:24.480 --> 34:29.179
over text or in an email.

34:29.230 --> 34:30.857
Forget publishing
with Eggers.

34:32.150 --> 34:33.970
What, they lost interest?

34:34.030 --> 34:37.443
No_. Someone else
Is Interested.

34:37.490 --> 34:40.812

36:33.310 --> 36:34.641
[exhales]

36:41.820 --> 36:44.983
I never expected
to be in this situation.

36:46.780 --> 36:48.987
I wanted us to work.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.320
You know that.

36:54.370 --> 36:57.453
Lets be honest.

36:57.500 --> 36:58.956
The relationship
wasnt working.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.503
Its been over
for a long tIme.

37:03.050 --> 37:04.631
We tried.

37:08.600 --> 37:12.809
I dont expect you
to accept this,

37:12.850 --> 37:15.512
whats going on
between me and...

37:15.560 --> 37:17.266

My sister.

37:37.710 --> 37:39.029
I dont know you.

37:42.630 --> 37:44.211
Maybe I never did.

37:46.010 --> 37:47.830
And now I dont
trust you.

37:49.300 --> 37:52.053
And I wonder, truly...

37:53.560 --> 37:56.723
I wonder how much
you value honesty...

37:58.020 --> 38:01.353
walking around here
with your head so high,

38:01.400 --> 38:03.561
always judging.

38:07.740 --> 38:09.196
But I know now.

38:12.580 --> 38:14.741
You cant trust anyone.

38:16.330 --> 38:17.661
Not even your own blood.

38:21.670 --> 38:23.297
Whatever youre doing...

38:23.340 --> 38:25.160
with Nova...

38:29.590 --> 38:31.842
you better be damn sure

38:31.890 --> 38:35.178
you know exactly
what she wants.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.181
Because if you hurt her...

38:43.150 --> 38:45.027
if you make her feel
even an ounce

38:45.070 --> 38:47.106
of what Im feeling
right now...

39:01.670 --> 39:03.831
Nova and I...

39:06.840 --> 39:08.296
were forever.

39:12.430 --> 39:13.840
Were family.

39:19.140 --> 39:20.801
But you...

39:26.530 --> 39:28.145
you will always
be fleeting.
