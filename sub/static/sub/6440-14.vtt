00:19.080 --> 00:21.160
Let me go.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.560
What do you want from me?

00:32.920 --> 00:34.840
The truth.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.200
- Can I see some ID?
- You must be new here.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.840
Hey, it's okay, let him through.

00:50.040 --> 00:53.200
- Thanks, Kasich.
- No problem.

00:56.920 --> 01:00.320
- She's cute.
- She's engaged.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.440
What do you think?

01:12.800 --> 01:14.840
It's loud.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.080
- How's the VIP room tonight?
- I think we can make some room for you.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.800
I hope you didn't feel obligated
to entertain me.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.720
Jude's only gone for a couple days.

01:26.880 --> 01:30.600
I don't believe in obligations.
Besides, your fiancÃ© did me a favour.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.120
I wasn't looking forward to a night out
on my own.

01:35.040 --> 01:38.760
Something tells me you wouldn't
have been alone for very long.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.000
- Two apple martinis.
- Coming up.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.680
"Zero consequences."

01:46.600 --> 01:48.320
That's quite a promise.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.880
Only if it's kept.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.080
To my good friend Amanda
on her engagement.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.640
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.040
What is it?

02:02.960 --> 02:04.720
What are you doing?

02:16.280 --> 02:18.160
- Amanda.
- You said you had to go away...

02:18.360 --> 02:21.480
...on business.
- I can explain, okay? Just wait.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.280
Amanda, wait a sec...

02:24.880 --> 02:28.160
I can explain, Amanda. Just wait.
Amanda!

02:29.720 --> 02:33.000
You son of a bitch.
You did this on purpose.

02:33.760 --> 02:38.840
You did it to yourself.
Amanda deserves better.

03:30.480 --> 03:35.120
Liar! That's what it said in the papers,
but that's not what really happened.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.480
- It's the truth. Read the police reports!
- I know you covered it up.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.640
I don't know how you did it,
but you're gonna pay.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.400
Who are you?

03:44.480 --> 03:46.600
Don't you remember?

03:49.080 --> 03:50.480
You killed me.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.760
Daddy can't save you this time, Lex.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.560
Zero

04:57.640 --> 05:00.360
There is nothing like 50 minutes
of Mr. Austin's English class...

05:00.520 --> 05:03.520
...that works up an appetite.
- Nothing like a student biography...

05:03.680 --> 05:06.000
...due Monday to help me lose mine.
- The biography part...

05:06.200 --> 05:08.960
...or the fact that our student subjects
were randomly assigned?

05:09.160 --> 05:11.440
Pete's convinced that the drawing
was fixed.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.320
There are a dozen ladies in our class,
each worthy of lengthy interrogation.

05:15.480 --> 05:19.360
- I get stuck with Stan Gibson?
- The manager of the student store?

05:19.520 --> 05:21.000
- I hear he's very...
- Efficient?

05:21.160 --> 05:24.840
Funny. I'm about to learn more about
the art of selling "Go Crow" pennants...

05:25.000 --> 05:27.200
...than any human
should have to endure.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.200
You haven't stopped smiling since
we left. Who's your victim?

05:30.360 --> 05:33.560
The illustrious Mr. Kent himself.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.000
- Me?
- I take it back.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.000
Chloe's the one with the challenge.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.640
- Excuse me?
- No offence, Clark...

05:38.800 --> 05:40.840
...but digging up six pages of interesting
on you...

05:41.000 --> 05:43.480
...is gonna require serious excavation.
- I do stuff.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.760
Yes, and I'm sure that once I deploy
my journalistic skills on you...

05:46.920 --> 05:48.520
...I'll unearth a skeleton or two.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.160
You know, Chloe, this is a class project,
not a corruption scandal.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.720
Relax. It's not like you
have anything to hide, right?

05:54.880 --> 05:57.600
Come on, Clark, cough up.
Who'd you get?

05:57.760 --> 06:00.120
Don't tell me. Lana Lang.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.520
Just look at his face,
you don't even have to see it.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.720
Like I said, definitely rigged.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.720
- I assume you'll start your paper ASAP?
- It's all gonna work out.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.680
I'm helping Lana at the Talon
getting ready for the opening.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.720
Surrogate boyfriend
does the heavy lifting...

06:12.880 --> 06:14.360
...while Whitney
works at his dad's store.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.040
- On that note...
- Wait.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.200
When are you gonna sit down
to do my interview?

06:18.360 --> 06:21.760
Right. I'll be around.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.080
Did he just blow me off?

06:24.240 --> 06:27.960
One step forward, two steps back.
Come on.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.760
You promised everything would be ready
on time.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.360
That was before the plumbing
started leaking.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.920
- Hasn't been replaced in years.
- How long will that take?

06:41.080 --> 06:46.880
I can't really give you a straight answer,
not until I crawl up there.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.680
You resurrect the past,
you get the problems that come with it.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.640
Lex Luthor's going to be by later.
He's going to need numbers...

06:53.800 --> 06:57.440
...and a timetable
and a better explanation than that.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.360
Sorry, we're not open yet.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.520
It's about the
assistant manager position.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.000
I know I'm late, but if I can get
an application...

07:12.200 --> 07:16.880
- Yeah, yeah, just give me a second.
- Great. Really appreciate this, Miss...?

07:17.080 --> 07:18.280
- Lang.
- Lang.

07:18.440 --> 07:22.040
Just to warn you, my aunt's not taking
any more interviews until next week.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.480
Well, that's all right. I happen
to have all the time in the world.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.840
- I'm Jude Royce.
- Hi.

07:29.440 --> 07:33.040
So I understand that Lex Luthor
has a stake in this project.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.360
Yeah, he's one of the owners.
Why? Do you know him?

07:37.680 --> 07:41.240
- A lifetime ago in Metropolis.
- Must have been interesting.

07:41.800 --> 07:45.200
Well, let's just say there's a reason
he's in Smallville.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.920
You know my advice?
Stay away from him.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.840
When Lex gets involved,
things usually turn out badly.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.040
What are you doing here?
We had an understanding.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.480
After that night,
we were never to have any contact.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.800
- I saw him, Lex.
- Who?

08:19.960 --> 08:21.720
Jude.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.640
- We both know that's impossible.
- Listen to me! He's alive.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.480
Everywhere I go, I see him.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.160
- He's stalking me.
- Kasich. Calm down.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.400
I'm not crazy.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.600
- This man say what he wanted?
- Yeah. The truth.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.320
Listen. I keep an apartment in the city.

08:43.480 --> 08:48.040
It's very secure. You stay there
and wait for my call.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.720
- Hey, Lex.
- Hey.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.560
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.520
I hear we sprung a leak.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.880
Is everything all right?

09:11.960 --> 09:14.680
- Just a little weirded out.
- Relax, it's just a leak.

09:14.880 --> 09:18.160
No, a friend of yours came by, applied
for the assistant manager position.

09:18.560 --> 09:21.880
He told me to stay away from you.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.600
What was his name?

09:30.680 --> 09:31.960
Jude Royce.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.520
- What is it, Lex?
- When did he leave?

09:44.680 --> 09:46.080
Just before you came in.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.600
Lex, who's Jude Royce?

10:02.840 --> 10:05.760
Trust me, Clark,
I have no idea who Lana met today...

10:05.920 --> 10:08.160
...but it couldn't have been him.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.360
Don't worry about it, Clark. I'm not.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.000
What's going on?

10:30.760 --> 10:31.880
I don't know!

10:40.680 --> 10:43.200
Feel under the dash.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.160
Looks like someone decided
to get creative while I was inside.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.120
What were the screams?

10:59.640 --> 11:02.960
I assume it's someone's twisted idea
of a joke.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.880
And a successful one.
We've managed to draw a crowd.

11:11.760 --> 11:16.120
- Lex.
- Clark, this really doesn't concern you.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.920
Hello, anybody home?

11:30.160 --> 11:33.520
Hey, pull up a microphone, son.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.560
- Chloe, what's going on?
- Since I couldn't find you...

11:37.720 --> 11:40.560
...I decided to start my biographical
inquiry at the beginning.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.720
Unlike a certain
so-called friend of mine...

11:42.880 --> 11:45.080
...your parents gracefully agreed
to be interviewed.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.320
Chloe's been asking us
some very interesting questions, Clark.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.640
Thank you. Now, we just
have a few more to go, so...

11:52.360 --> 11:54.280
We were talking about the early days.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.720
Now, what was involved
in adopting Clark?

11:58.040 --> 12:01.880
Well, it was... It was just like
any normal adoption, I guess.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.360
Can you take me through the process?
Did it takes weeks or months?

12:05.520 --> 12:08.600
Did you guys use a lawyer,
or did you go through an agen...?

12:08.760 --> 12:13.680
Shoot. I'm out of tape. That's okay,
I've got some extra C-90s in my car.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.600
I'll be right back.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.080
Chloe's researching your life
for a school project?

12:21.240 --> 12:23.760
- When did that happen?
- We just got the assignment today.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.640
I didn't know she was gonna
go Mike Wallace.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.440
We don't mind talking about you...

12:27.640 --> 12:30.200
...but if she starts asking questions
about the adoption...

12:30.600 --> 12:32.880
What about the adoption?

12:34.080 --> 12:35.640
Is there something I should know?

12:37.480 --> 12:39.600
Well, of course,
we had to make up a story...

12:39.760 --> 12:41.600
...but it's more complicated
than that.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.760
Let's just say it's a subject we
would rather not have anyone explore.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.360
Sorry. Am I interrupting?

12:47.040 --> 12:49.600
Clark, now that you're finally spinning
in my orbit...

12:49.760 --> 12:52.120
...I have a couple
of pertinents for you too.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.320
Actually, this is just a pit stop for me.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.720
I'm on my way to meet Lana
to work on my paper.

12:57.400 --> 13:02.320
You know, Clark, not to strike a
paranoid note, but are you avoiding me?

13:06.400 --> 13:08.120
Tomorrow, I promise.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.520
Okay, this isn't an official question...

13:15.680 --> 13:18.280
...and I don't want you guys to take it
the wrong way...

13:18.480 --> 13:21.400
...but has your son
always been this strange?

13:24.960 --> 13:27.160
- How does it feel?
- Feel?

13:27.320 --> 13:29.320
To single-handedly
bring the Talon back...

13:29.480 --> 13:32.400
...from the brink of becoming
a parking garage?

13:32.840 --> 13:36.200
It's nice, you know, being counted on,
having responsibility.

13:36.360 --> 13:39.240
- People treat you differently.
- Like you won't break.

13:39.760 --> 13:43.400
Finally feel like I'm shedding
that fairy-princess costume.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.320
- Lex, what are you doing here?
- Contractor called.

13:58.520 --> 14:01.360
Said he had an estimate,
wanted me to meet him here.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.160
What the hell?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.520
Are you okay?

14:16.600 --> 14:21.520
Yeah. I came in the back door
and some guy jumped me...

14:21.680 --> 14:24.400
...and forced me to let him in
and bashed me over the head.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.560
Did you see his face?

14:27.280 --> 14:28.920
No.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.120
Look.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.640
That wasn't there when I locked up.
I'll go call the police.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.120
Lex, your name's on it.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.320
Zero consequences.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.760
How you holding up?

15:30.280 --> 15:33.480
I was fine... until it showed up.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.960
Yeah, stupid question.

15:36.160 --> 15:39.040
What kind of a sick person
would do a thing like that?

15:40.120 --> 15:41.600
I don't know.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.400
But I've never seen Lex
so freaked out before.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.480
Join the club.

15:47.240 --> 15:51.800
That guy warned me. He said everything
Lex touches ends badly.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.640
How much do we really know about him
and his past?

15:56.320 --> 15:59.640
I want you both to know how truly sorry
I am about this.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.720
I promise this won't affect
the grand opening.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.760
We're going to be infamous
before we even open the doors.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.920
Do you know who he is?
The guy in the... You know.

16:20.120 --> 16:25.080
Max Kasich. And yes, I knew him
a long time ago in Metropolis.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.600
Do you have any idea
who might have done this to him?

16:28.800 --> 16:30.080
Not at all.

16:32.480 --> 16:35.160
What about your old friend Jude Royce?

16:35.800 --> 16:39.320
- I doubt it could have been him, Clark.
- Why?

16:39.920 --> 16:42.520
Because he's been dead for three years.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.800
The only information
I got from the Kents...

16:51.960 --> 16:54.640
...was the earth-shattering admission
that Clark hates peas.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.760
A body part shows up at the Talon
and all you can talk about is Clark?

16:57.920 --> 17:00.960
Where are your priorities?
Lex Luthor must be mixed up in this.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.160
I know you've got issues
with the Luthors...

17:03.320 --> 17:06.359
More than issues.
You know what they did to my family.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.319
One piece of investigative information
at a time.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.040
- Now, about Clark...
- Chloe, what do you want from me?

17:11.200 --> 17:13.720
In a world of designer water,
Clark's from the tap.

17:13.880 --> 17:17.520
But you've known him the longest.
All I need is just a little anecdote...

17:17.720 --> 17:20.760
...just a small piece of information
from Clark's deep, dark past.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.359
Well, there was something
back in the first grade.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.359
Thank you! That's more
than I've uncovered the past two days.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.040
Now, please, let's continue.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.880
There was a bully three grades ahead.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.520
This dude was determined
to pound dents into every kid.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.600
One day it was my turn.
He was just about to take my head off...

17:35.760 --> 17:39.040
...when Clark jumped between us.
- So Clark ran interference?

17:40.600 --> 17:42.560
Now, as kind as that sounds, Pete...

17:42.720 --> 17:45.160
...I don't think it falls into
the "something amazing" test.

17:45.480 --> 17:46.720
- What test?
- I'm not finished.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.440
Clark didn't just push Braindead,
he put him through a door...

17:49.600 --> 17:53.000
...as in splinters and broken hinges.
How he did it, I still have no idea.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.160
- Guy was at least twice our size.
- Clark, any comments?

17:58.560 --> 18:02.400
Well, we were, you know, 6 years old.
Twice our size was three feet tall.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.080
If you need more ancient history,
ask the source.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.760
I've got an appointment
at the student store.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.720
Have fun.

18:10.040 --> 18:13.480
And so the mystery
that isn't Clark Kent deepens.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.880
- Mystery?
- Yeah.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.000
Since you continue
to play obstructionist...

18:17.200 --> 18:19.560
...I've had to find information
through other means.

18:19.720 --> 18:23.240
I found that your adoption was done
through Metropolis United Charities...

18:23.400 --> 18:26.480
...but this is the strange part.
They were in business for six months...

18:26.640 --> 18:29.480
...and from what I can tell,
yours is the only adoption they handled.

18:29.640 --> 18:31.280
I can't believe you did this, Chloe.

18:32.960 --> 18:36.440
You didn't know? I just assumed
that your parents would have told you.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.320
- I mean, weren't you interested?
- Why would I be?

18:39.480 --> 18:41.920
My biological parents are either dead
or didn't want me.

18:42.080 --> 18:45.440
- You're prying into my private life.
- I was just trying to be thorough.

18:45.640 --> 18:49.200
This is a class project. I spent an hour
yesterday with Lana, that's it.

18:49.360 --> 18:53.600
That's all I needed.
I'm not some mystery for you to solve.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.640
Clark, I...

19:02.360 --> 19:04.080
Talk to me, Mr. Raines.

19:04.240 --> 19:08.760
According to the doorman, Kasich never
made it to the apartment in Metropolis.

19:08.960 --> 19:12.120
- What about Royce?
- His parents died when he was young.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.680
Car accident. He was
an only child, inherited everything.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.240
And Amanda Rothman?
Have you tracked her down yet?

19:18.400 --> 19:22.840
She moved, left no forwarding address.
When's the last time you spoke to her?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.160
About three years ago.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.280
I'll go wider,
but it could take some time.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.320
It'd help if you tell me
what's going on.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.880
No, it wouldn't.
You're my head of security.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.200
You find her and warn her
she could be in danger.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.360
That's all you need to know.

19:53.960 --> 19:58.160
Make a path. Police.
Excuse me, excuse me. Police.

19:58.680 --> 20:02.360
- Who are you?
- Detective Sam Phelan, Metropolis P.D.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.680
Are you what passes for security
in this zoo?

20:04.960 --> 20:08.840
- Yeah.
- Don't go anywhere. We'll talk.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.480
- Thank God you're here.
- Lex, Lex.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.200
You really put your foot in it this time.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.440
Tell me exactly what happened.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.480
Hey, if you fall apart on me,
I can't help you.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.560
Now what went down?

20:38.240 --> 20:39.920
That's exactly what happened?

20:40.840 --> 20:44.120
Good. Here's how it's gonna go.

20:44.280 --> 20:48.360
You were never here. Your name will not
appear in any papers or the police report.

20:48.560 --> 20:52.360
- How?
- That's what your daddy's money's for.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.400
This one's gonna cost him.

20:55.760 --> 20:59.720
- What about Amanda?
- I'll take care of everybody's story...

20:59.880 --> 21:03.640
...but you are never to see her
or talk to her again. You got it?

21:03.920 --> 21:07.120
Call this guy,
he'll take care of your shoulder.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.840
No emergency rooms.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.120
All right, get out of here.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.600
- Did you see what happened?
- Most of it.

21:28.760 --> 21:33.280
Well, smile. Because you're about to
come into some serious money.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.720
Nothing to say?

22:03.280 --> 22:05.640
I thought Lex Luthor
had all the answers.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.080
Look, you twisted son of a bitch.

22:08.240 --> 22:11.440
- I don't know what you want.
- What happened at Club Zero.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.600
The cover-up.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.360
You know the cop?

22:17.560 --> 22:19.520
The one on the report? Phelan?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.720
He's dead.

22:23.200 --> 22:27.120
It seems you were somehow involved
in that too. I find that very interesting.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.680
Why don't you kill me now?

22:32.480 --> 22:35.160
Because it's more fun
to watch you suffer.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.800
Knowing that at any moment, bang!

22:41.920 --> 22:43.560
Tell me.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.480
What really happened?

22:49.440 --> 22:51.280
Lex!

22:57.000 --> 22:59.640
Lex, you all right?

23:03.400 --> 23:05.440
Clark, what are you doing here?

23:05.880 --> 23:08.120
Your office told me you were here.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.680
I thought I heard someone else.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.600
No. I'm all by myself.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.440
Hey, I looked up Max Kasich.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.640
I know what happened at Club Zero.

23:20.800 --> 23:25.600
That he was shot and killed Jude Royce.
Everyone fits into this except for you.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.720
- What's going on?
- Please, Clark.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.440
For our friendship, I'm asking you
to stay out of this.

23:32.360 --> 23:35.160
Some secrets are better left alone.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.720
Clark.

23:45.960 --> 23:50.360
Come on, son, the cows aren't
gonna feed themselves.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.800
- You have a late night?
- I was helping Lana.

23:52.960 --> 23:57.160
She's not gonna let the whole body-part
incident delay the opening of the Talon.

23:57.320 --> 24:01.000
That's what happens when you get into
business with somebody like Lex Luthor.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.720
If it wasn't for Lex,
the Talon would be a parking garage.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.920
Son, he casts a very, very long shadow.

24:06.080 --> 24:09.040
I just want to make sure
none of you kids get hurt, that's all.

24:09.200 --> 24:13.280
The past is in the past.
The best we can do is look to the future.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.280
All right, you got me.

24:15.440 --> 24:18.600
Speaking of that,
how's Chloe's paper coming along?

24:18.760 --> 24:20.520
I assume she's done
with her interviews?

24:20.680 --> 24:22.160
I'm not sure.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.680
Look, Clark, if she mentions anything
to you about the peas, I'm sorry.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.840
It's the first thing that came to mind.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.480
And if she mentions anything to me
about the Metropolis United Charities?

24:34.680 --> 24:38.080
I used to think perseverance
was an admirable quality.

24:38.600 --> 24:42.040
Since I learned the real truth,
I hadn't thought about the adoption.

24:42.200 --> 24:46.040
Dad, Chloe told me the agency you used
was only open six months...

24:46.200 --> 24:48.600
...and I was the only kid adopted.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.880
Look, son...

24:51.400 --> 24:55.240
...the process is a really tough one even
when you go through normal channels.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.280
With you, it was just
a little more complicated, that's all.

24:58.960 --> 25:02.880
- Is everything legal?
- Yeah, it's legal, it's just...

25:03.160 --> 25:06.480
Well, it required a higher level of access
than your mother or I had.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.560
What does that mean?

25:10.880 --> 25:14.560
Let's just say it's a long road between
what's sitting in our storm cellar...

25:14.760 --> 25:17.200
...and what's written
on your birth certificate.

25:20.280 --> 25:23.680
- You hear that?
- Hear what?

25:24.840 --> 25:28.320
The whole herd's just over that rise.
We ought to be hearing something.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.840
What do you think happened?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.960
Why would LuthorCorp
dump their stuff here?

26:24.920 --> 26:27.920
I'm gonna go take
from some different angles.

26:46.120 --> 26:50.520
Mr. And Mrs. Kent, I have no idea
how this could have happened...

26:50.680 --> 26:55.360
...but I'll do everything in my power
to find out.

26:56.320 --> 26:59.360
And I'll pay for your livestock, of course.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.800
You think that's how
you solve everything, don't you, Lex?

27:02.960 --> 27:06.760
You sprinkle a little money on it
and hope the problem goes away.

27:07.480 --> 27:11.120
Well, obviously, some things
are a little more difficult than that.

27:18.600 --> 27:22.160
I didn't think it was possible to fall
any further in your father's eyes.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.400
Obviously, I was wrong.

27:26.320 --> 27:29.000
I'd never intentionally allow
something like this to happen.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.520
Does this have anything
to do with Club Zero?

27:34.680 --> 27:36.960
- I think so.
- You need to tell the authorities...

27:37.120 --> 27:40.320
...everything you know.
This isn't just about you anymore.

27:47.520 --> 27:52.160
Mr. Luthor, the C.E.P. Guy
needs to talk to you. He's over there.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.640
Looks like a black mark
on your company's environmental record.

28:08.040 --> 28:11.200
- I'm gonna walk over and get the sheriff.
- And tell him what?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.640
Just tell him that Clark Kent called.
Thank you.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.720
- Who was that?
- I'm trying to reach Lex.

28:25.880 --> 28:28.000
He's not in the office.
He's not at the mansion...

28:28.160 --> 28:30.720
...and his cell phone goes straight
to voice mail.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.280
Where's Dad?

28:32.480 --> 28:34.520
Still supervising
the removal of the cows.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.360
- Lex said he'd pay for that.
- Clark, this isn't just about money.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.640
We don't know
what kind of health threat...

28:39.800 --> 28:42.360
...this poses to us or to our neighbours.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.200
I don't think this is Lex's fault.

28:44.360 --> 28:45.800
Someone is trying to set him up...

28:45.960 --> 28:48.000
...because of what happened
at the nightclub.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.720
Look.

28:52.360 --> 28:55.440
- Until this is cleared up, I don't...
- Lex has always been a good friend.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.560
I know.
I'm usually the one who defends him...

28:57.720 --> 29:00.920
...but there are some things in his past
that are a little shady.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.280
In this family we don't look at the past.

29:03.440 --> 29:07.120
Clark, I grew up in Metropolis,
I know the Luthor world.

29:07.280 --> 29:10.320
It looks glamorous and fun,
but the kids grow up too fast...

29:10.520 --> 29:12.040
...and they can get into trouble.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.920
Whatever's happening to Lex is starting
to affect you.

29:15.080 --> 29:19.440
Body parts in boxes and poisoned cows?
This isn't normal.

29:19.760 --> 29:22.080
What do you want me to do?
Cut him out of my life?

29:22.280 --> 29:25.880
No, I want you to cool it off for a while
until we know what really happened.

29:26.560 --> 29:30.840
Your father and I just don't want to
see you pulled into his problems.

29:40.960 --> 29:43.160
Can I talk to you for a second?

29:47.240 --> 29:48.760
How you doing?

29:48.920 --> 29:52.880
- That depends if it's on the record.
- Okay, I deserve that.

29:53.040 --> 29:57.280
Look, I didn't mean to ambush you
with the whole adoption agency thing.

29:57.640 --> 30:00.240
Hey, you saw a story
and you went right for it.

30:00.440 --> 30:02.440
- That's what journalists do.
- You're right.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.600
I didn't think about
how it would hurt you.

30:04.760 --> 30:08.800
And, you know,
as much as journalistic instinct rebels...

30:08.960 --> 30:11.200
...I'd rather have a friend
than a subject...

30:11.360 --> 30:14.080
...so I'm dropping the whole thing.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.200
Thank you.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.520
Can I ask you a question?

30:22.120 --> 30:24.240
Totally off the record.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.000
Do you ever wonder
about your biological parents?

30:30.720 --> 30:32.840
Every day of my life.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.880
Looks like I'm not the only one
doing some digging.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.360
- What's Club Zero?
- Part of Lex's past...

30:45.520 --> 30:47.800
...he asked me to stay out of.

30:49.720 --> 30:53.200
By the way, I brought by
some pictures for your parents.

30:53.360 --> 30:56.400
I figured they could use it
for insurance purposes and stuff.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.840
I'll see you later. I gotta go.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.600
Chloe...

31:02.760 --> 31:04.640
...it's the same guy.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.080
- Wait, but he's...
- Dead.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.720
Help!

31:26.560 --> 31:28.720
Somebody!

31:29.400 --> 31:31.560
Help!

31:32.360 --> 31:34.480
Help!

31:39.360 --> 31:40.920
Somebody!

31:41.600 --> 31:44.280
No word from Lex. No one's
spoken to him since this morning.

31:44.440 --> 31:48.240
I pulled our alleged dead guy's license.
It's registered to a John Smith. Original.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.200
He has an address in Metropolis
and does not work for the C.E.P.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.640
- How'd you do that?
- I hacked into the DMV database.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.360
- Sometimes persistence is a good thing.
- Call Metropolis P.D.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.880
- Have them go to that address.
- What's going on?

31:59.040 --> 32:00.920
I think Lex is in serious trouble.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.560
You ready to talk?

32:13.280 --> 32:16.600
You're finally where you should
have been three years ago.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.520
Exposed in the spotlight.

32:20.680 --> 32:23.280
What do you want from me?

32:23.920 --> 32:26.600
The truth about Club Zero.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.920
Kasich.

32:56.120 --> 32:58.960
Excuse me,
did you find anyone else in there?

33:03.560 --> 33:07.000
- You know where I can find Club Zero?
- You're six months too late, kid.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.200
- What do you mean?
- Well, it closed down.

33:09.360 --> 33:11.440
It was an old warehouse
on 78th and Main.

33:15.120 --> 33:18.840
Liar! That's what it said in the papers,
but that's not what really happened.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.320
- It's the truth. Read the police reports!
- I know you covered it up.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.640
I don't know how you did it,
but you're gonna pay.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.200
Who are you?

33:28.360 --> 33:30.360
Don't you remember?

33:32.880 --> 33:34.360
You killed me.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.040
Daddy can't save you this time, Lex.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.440
No more games, Lex.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.000
It's time for the truth.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.960
I know you.
You're the contractor from the Talon.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.320
That's my day job.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.719
Who are you?

34:40.520 --> 34:42.400
Amanda never talked about her family?

34:43.760 --> 34:46.960
She said she had a brother
in Central City.

34:47.199 --> 34:50.040
He was in prison. She was the only
person who kept in touch.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.960
She was my lifeline when I was inside.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.440
I never had a rich daddy
to keep me out of jail.

34:54.880 --> 34:58.080
- I don't understand. What do you want?
- What do I want? What do I want?

34:58.280 --> 35:01.840
I want vengeance for my sister.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.680
What do you mean? Where's Amanda?

35:06.840 --> 35:09.000
She's dead, Lex.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.200
She committed suicide a year ago.

35:14.200 --> 35:17.440
- I never knew.
- Because you cut her out of your life.

35:18.280 --> 35:22.440
She was never the same after Club Zero.
Jude's death devastated her.

35:22.640 --> 35:26.680
He was the love of her life.
You took all that away.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.480
She had nothing to live for.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.160
Who's that?

35:35.280 --> 35:37.400
Lucky break.

35:37.840 --> 35:39.720
Couple weeks after Amanda's funeral...

35:39.880 --> 35:43.120
...I walk into a greasy spoon
in Bludhaven and there he is.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.080
I couldn't believe it.
Short-order cook flipping burgers.

35:46.240 --> 35:50.680
You know how they say everyone in life
has a double? I had to look twice.

35:51.400 --> 35:55.400
I figure if he can fool me,
he can fool you.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.480
Why'd he do it?

36:00.560 --> 36:03.920
He was on parole, needed the money,
and that's when I got the idea.

36:04.080 --> 36:08.200
You ruined Mandy's life, I'd ruin yours.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.720
Mandy's finally gonna get the justice
she deserves.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.640
You were right.

36:15.560 --> 36:20.720
You were right. The newspapers,
the police reports, what I told Phelan.

36:21.040 --> 36:24.880
They were all lies. You want the truth?
I'll give it to you.

36:59.800 --> 37:03.880
- No, no, no. You're twisting it again!
- That's what happened!

37:04.040 --> 37:06.200
That's what happened.
Amanda pulled the trigger.

37:06.360 --> 37:08.960
She shot Jude.
I was just trying to protect her.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.400
I'm through with you, Lex!

37:12.680 --> 37:14.480
Killing me won't bring Amanda back.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.560
None of this can change
what happened.

37:16.720 --> 37:17.960
I don't care.

37:18.120 --> 37:20.240
After tonight,
you'll never hurt anyone else.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.040
You can't escape your past, Lex.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.600
Lex!

37:43.760 --> 37:45.840
Get down!
There's a man with a gun up there.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.520
Where? You mean that guy?

37:48.680 --> 37:52.360
- What happened?
- I have no idea.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.760
How'd you find me here?

37:54.960 --> 37:56.720
With a little help from my friends.

38:25.960 --> 38:30.200
- So, what do you think?
- I'm definitely surprised.

38:30.360 --> 38:32.080
Me too.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.240
Where's Chloe?

38:34.640 --> 38:37.800
She said she wanted to be
fashionably late.

38:40.760 --> 38:42.320
I got this for you.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.440
Don't worry, it's not a body part.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.640
It was in the attic.
It was my grandfather's.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.480
It was taken just after the Talon opened.

38:52.880 --> 38:57.800
- You could hang it above the counter.
- Clark, it's amazing. Thank you.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.520
You're welcome.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.120
I better get back to work.

39:04.680 --> 39:06.640
How does it feel?

39:06.880 --> 39:11.640
- Terrifying. Don't tell anybody.
- Your secret's safe with me.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.320
I get the feeling
you're avoiding me, Clark.

39:26.320 --> 39:29.280
I just realized there's a lot
I don't know about you.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.840
You think my dark past
is gonna rub off on you?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.240
I was trying to protect Amanda.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.240
My father wouldn't
raise a finger to help her...

39:39.440 --> 39:41.520
...but I knew he'd do anything
to save his only son.

39:41.920 --> 39:45.040
So you took the fall
and everything was covered up?

39:45.520 --> 39:48.560
Is that really what happened?
Is it the truth?

39:50.280 --> 39:53.680
The truth is, I'd do anything
to protect my friends.
