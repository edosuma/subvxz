00:14.000 --> 00:16.958
- Fayed has the bombs.
- Where is he?

00:17.040 --> 00:20.157
I don't know, but I can help you find him.

00:21.200 --> 00:25.478
Preparing the tracker now.
We can track up to 15 miles.

00:25.560 --> 00:29.439
And we are locked on the isotope signature
that's being emitted from Gredenko's arm.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.115
- You led them to me.
- I had no choice.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.156
I don't like it. Something's wrong.
I'm heading in.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.514
Which direction, Milo?

00:36.600 --> 00:39.068
He stopped
and entered the building on the left.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.674
(Jack) Milo, no one's in here.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.309
My God! They cut off Gredenko's arm!
Ryan, move your men in now!

00:45.400 --> 00:46.833
I want Fayed alive.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.715
- We're trapped.
- This way.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.476
I recognise him from the news!
It's the terrorist they're looking for!

00:56.560 --> 00:59.074
- (man) That is him.
- You bastard.

01:05.519 --> 01:06.396
Back off!

01:06.480 --> 01:09.517
Gredenko is not here.
Lock down the area, initiate a search.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.151
One of the cabinet votes is invalid.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.119
The tally's seven to six in favour
of invoking the 25th Amendment

01:18.200 --> 01:20.760
and removing President Palmer from power.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.193
I'm sorry, Wayne.

01:22.280 --> 01:27.354
Noah, don't waste your apologies on me,
because I won't let you steal the presidency.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.955
As I'm sure you're aware, sir,

01:31.040 --> 01:34.350
conspiracy to commit perjury
is a felony offence.

01:34.440 --> 01:37.989
(Lisa) My affidavit will push the court
to rule in your favour so that you can do

01:38.080 --> 01:41.675
- what's right for this country.
- (Daniels) You're right. Do it.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.988
Turn it off.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.959
Wayne. The Supreme Court was just notified
Daniels withdrew his suit.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.315
You're still the President of the United States.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.192
- President Palmer.
- What?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.874
He's about to go ahead
with the nuclear strike.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.155
This makes no sense, sir.

01:58.240 --> 02:02.631
- It's what you risked your life to stop!
- I risked my life to reassert my authority.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.270
Mr President.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.591
- We have a successful launch.
- Good.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.189
Mr President...
the missile is just entering target's airspace.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.271
- Mr President...
- I'm done talking.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.318
We both agreed a nuclear strike is pointless.

02:33.400 --> 02:38.679
Fayed's actions are not state-sponsored
and his country cannot be held accountable.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.512
Five minutes to impact.

02:40.600 --> 02:45.151
The ambassador assured us his country's
doing everything possible to find the nukes.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.117
They simply don't know anything.

02:47.680 --> 02:52.834
One way or another, Tom,
we're about to find out if that's true.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.592
- Buchanan.
- It's me.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.389
- Have you gotten anything from Fayed?
- Jack's interrogating him.

03:03.480 --> 03:07.268
He's not optimistic about breaking him.
What's going on?

03:07.360 --> 03:09.590
The president's gone ahead with the strike.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.830
- He what?!
- He's launched it, Bill.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.911
- Why?
- I don't know why.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.118
He fought the vice president and now
he's just going ahead with Daniels' plan.

03:18.200 --> 03:23.035
It doesn't make any sense.
We've gotta stop this.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.912
Bill, can I tell the president
that you have a solid lead from Fayed

03:28.000 --> 03:30.639
on the location
of the suitcase nukes?

03:30.720 --> 03:34.235
Provide a pretext to bring the missile down?
Karen, I can't do that.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.357
Fayed's not talking, Gredenko's dead.
I don't have anything.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.032
OK. OK.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.676
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.751
I'll call you later.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.434
Sir, we have confirmation
their radar's tagged the missile.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.993
They're scrambling fighters
and readying air defences.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.957
They know we're coming. Good.

03:59.040 --> 04:02.350
I just got off the phone with CTU.
Bauer's interrogating Fayed.

04:02.440 --> 04:06.672
- He'll soon have the location of those bombs.
- No, Karen. We can't afford to wait.

04:06.760 --> 04:11.436
Sir, we can't afford not to.
Please, why are you doing this?

04:12.520 --> 04:15.592
Four minutes to impact, Mr President.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.912
(Tom) Mr President.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.991
(phone beeps)

04:31.080 --> 04:32.513
- Yes?
- (woman) Excuse me.

04:32.600 --> 04:38.072
- We have the ambassador for the president.
- This is President Palmer.

04:38.160 --> 04:42.597
My government has alerted me of the nuclear
weapon heading toward my country.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.478
That's correct.
We've made good on our threat.

04:45.560 --> 04:49.633
- For God's sake, I implore you to stop it.
- On what grounds?

04:49.720 --> 04:53.315
We have uncovered new information
regarding your situation.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.069
I'm listening.

04:55.160 --> 04:58.709
We have identified a general
in central command, Mohmar Habib,

04:58.800 --> 05:00.791
who has also been in contact with Fayed.

05:00.880 --> 05:04.316
It's our belief he's been helping
orchestrate the attacks.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.075
- Have you arrested Habib?
- Yes, yes. He's being interrogated.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.072
Please, you must abort this attack
before it's too late.

05:11.160 --> 05:14.755
Does Habib know the present location
of Fayed's nuclear weapons?

05:14.840 --> 05:19.197
It is my understanding his last contact
with Fayed was during the drone operation.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.478
He has no current knowledge of the weapons'
whereabouts or intended targets.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.394
Mr President... two minutes to impact, sir.

05:29.920 --> 05:35.074
Ambassador, your government has known
about this man for some time, haven't they?

05:35.160 --> 05:37.833
Mr President,
this development has come as a shock.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.672
Stop lying to me!

05:39.760 --> 05:44.072
That missile will hit in less than two minutes,
so please don't try my patience again.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.755
You must understand
the fragile political climate of our country.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.673
General Habib
is a high-ranking military commander.

05:50.760 --> 05:56.630
I really hope protecting this man was worth
pushing us to the brink of World War III.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.516
The missile will be aborted.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.878
But in the meantime, I strongly suggest
you get me a full dossier on General Habib.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.679
I want a thorough update on his interrogation.

06:10.760 --> 06:15.072
I'm also demanding that you return here
to the White House immediately.

06:15.160 --> 06:19.358
I want direct access to you, sir,
for the duration of this crisis.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.271
As you wish, Mr President.

06:24.680 --> 06:28.832
Commander, abort code
alpha, zero, delta, nine.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.994
Ditch it in the Gulf.

06:32.080 --> 06:38.315
My God, they were lying to us all the time,
withholding information, and you knew it.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.119
I suspected it.

06:42.120 --> 06:46.511
Well, I'll see that the Vickery sends a recovery
team to retrieve that nuclear warhead.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.511
That won't be necessary, Tom.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.957
The president ordered the launch of
a secondary missile on board the Vickery.

06:53.040 --> 06:56.237
- An unarmed one.
- What?!

06:56.320 --> 06:58.436
This was all a bluff?

06:58.520 --> 07:02.638
The vice president was right,
well, about one thing, anyway -

07:02.720 --> 07:07.510
that it was gonna take a willingness to strike
back before getting any real cooperation.

07:07.600 --> 07:12.116
The difference is I wasn't about to take
innocent lives to prove my point.

07:12.200 --> 07:18.230
Now, let's get this information to CTU.
Perhaps it's the key to breaking Fayed.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.549
This country is planning
a retaliatory strike against your people.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.473
I can stop it,
but tell me where the bombs are.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.551
Where are the bombs?!

07:40.160 --> 07:44.312
Fayed, this is over. You lost.
Save your people.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.551
Just tell me where the bombs are.

07:47.640 --> 07:53.636
Are you enjoying yourself, Bauer? As much
as you enjoyed butchering my little brother?

07:53.720 --> 07:58.316
Your brother was responsible
for the death of dozens of innocent lives.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.631
Now you're responsible for thousands.

08:02.680 --> 08:06.070
Trust me, I haven't begun to enjoy myself.

08:07.240 --> 08:11.836
Go ahead.
You'll get nothing from me and you know it.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.911
We'll see.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.831
(coughs)

08:20.200 --> 08:22.668
- This is not working.
- Let me have a go at him.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.399
No. That's exactly what he wants.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.233
He knows he's lost.
He wants us to martyr him.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.719
(phone rings)

08:29.800 --> 08:32.075
Hold on.

08:32.159 --> 08:36.073
- This is Bauer.
- It's Bill. What's your status with Fayed?

08:36.159 --> 08:38.993
Same as before. We're getting nowhere.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.434
I've just got new intel
from the White House.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.274
Fayed's government arrested
one of its generals - Mohmar Habib.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.636
He's been running Fayed,
helping him coordinate the attacks.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.109
- Then Habib knows where Fayed's men are.
- No.

08:51.200 --> 08:55.557
He claims there's been no contact since
the drone attack. They're interrogating him.

08:55.640 --> 09:00.634
Unless Habib gives us something more
useful, we have no location for these bombs.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.030
We have to try something more drastic.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.795
- How soon can Fayed be transported?
- Immediately, but we've got a play.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.873
You really think you'll be remembered
as some great martyr for your people?

09:11.960 --> 09:15.032
You blew up a little city
and you killed a lot of people today,

09:15.120 --> 09:19.432
but let's face it, that's gonna be
of no real political significance.

09:19.520 --> 09:24.389
Your number two guy, once he
realises that you're out of the picture,

09:24.480 --> 09:28.792
he's gonna take those remaining suitcase
nukes and blow up a substantial target,

09:28.880 --> 09:31.519
something that's
really gonna hurt this country.

09:31.600 --> 09:37.516
If by some chance he succeeds,
he's gonna be the hero of yourjihad,

09:37.600 --> 09:39.750
and you will be forgotten.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.035
Is that what you want?

09:43.760 --> 09:48.276
Do you honestly believe you can
manipulate me by playing on my vanity?

09:49.840 --> 09:51.956
I serve the will of God.

09:52.040 --> 09:56.272
No, you don't. And if you don't believe me,
ask Him when you meet Him.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.920
Agent Doyle, lower your weapon.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.719
I said, lower you weapon!

10:04.120 --> 10:06.509
Buchanan wants us
to transport Fayed to CTU.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.591
His men are probably on the move.

10:08.680 --> 10:12.389
The only way to break him is with a
pharmaceutical package. Burke is ready.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.596
We don't need Burke. Just give me time.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.592
Those are your orders.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.555
Agent Doyle, do you have a problem?

10:23.160 --> 10:26.391
- No problem.
- Good. Get your men ready.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.518
Now we're gonna have some fun.

10:47.720 --> 10:51.110
Excuse me, sir. Here's the file on Habib.

10:59.480 --> 11:03.359
- Is this the complete dossier on Habib?
- No, sir. It's preliminary.

11:03.440 --> 11:08.468
I was told by the ambassador's staff that more
would be forthcoming and relayed to CTU.

11:08.560 --> 11:11.393
Good. How soon
before the ambassador gets here?

11:11.480 --> 11:14.631
Within 15 minutes.
And I spoke with Secret Service.

11:14.720 --> 11:19.748
Your sister's on her way back to the hospital
to be with Walid. She's gonna call you soon.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.717
All right. Thank you.

11:25.920 --> 11:29.356
I did want to say...
your handling of the crisis...

11:29.440 --> 11:31.829
I know you're not happy
you were kept in the dark.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.354
The joint chiefs agreed
we keep the plan closed.

11:34.440 --> 11:40.993
That's not it. I just want to say I'm sorry
I doubted your strength and your leadership.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.110
It's all right.

11:44.200 --> 11:48.113
Well, respectfully, sir, no. It's not all right.

11:49.160 --> 11:53.358
Tom, you and I go back a long time.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.916
So let's be honest with each other.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.630
You believed the vice president was better
suited to lead this country through this crisis.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.915
And I was wrong about that, sir.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.355
If that missile
had detonated on foreign soil,

12:05.440 --> 12:08.512
Russia, China,
every nation with a nuclear capability,

12:08.600 --> 12:12.354
might have inserted themselves into this.
This could've been a world war.

12:12.440 --> 12:18.037
Unfortunately, we're already in a world war.
It's just taken me some time to realise that.

12:18.120 --> 12:22.716
If it hadn't have been for Vice President
Daniels, I would've had no gambit to play

12:22.800 --> 12:27.669
and the ambassador would never have
come forward with this intel on Habib.

12:28.360 --> 12:34.913
I'm not David, Tom, and I never will be,
but I am learning that who I am is not so bad.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.312
Yeah, we're all doing
some learning here today, aren't we, sir?

12:41.880 --> 12:43.871
Tom...

12:43.960 --> 12:47.191
Daniels withdrew his challenge
to my competency very suddenly

12:47.280 --> 12:51.239
and, from what I know,
without any discernible reason.

12:51.320 --> 12:55.871
- Change of heart, maybe?
- Something must have changed it.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.471
You have something on him, don't you?

13:00.560 --> 13:05.873
Sir, as chief of staff, I'm here to inform you
and also to protect you.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.793
Those jobs don't always work in combination.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.997
We're northbound on Washington.
ETA about six minutes.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.117
Tell Agent Burke
we're gonna need everything he's got.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.318
What if it doesn't work? I've never found
pharmaceutical torture that effective.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.391
- I have.
- (Fayed scoffs)

13:37.480 --> 13:42.600
If this is supposed to frighten me, you're
wasting your time. I won't tell you a thing.

13:43.440 --> 13:46.432
Whether you do or not,
I get to watch you suffer.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.829
Agent Doyle, I don't want you talking to...

13:48.920 --> 13:50.797
- Jack!
- Watch out!

14:01.160 --> 14:03.594
- Everybody OK?!
- Yeah.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.995
(men mutter in Arabic language)

14:09.080 --> 14:12.436
They're trying to flank us on both sides.
We're sitting ducks here!

14:12.520 --> 14:15.796
Try and get Fayed out the back.
I'll cover you from this side.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.916
All right.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.516
(man speaks Arabic language)

14:54.920 --> 14:57.753
(man speaks Arabic language)

15:30.600 --> 15:33.876
We're clear! We're clear!

15:38.160 --> 15:40.230
Bill, it's Jack. Do you copy?

15:40.320 --> 15:42.356
- Bill, do you copy?
- We're here, Jack.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.637
- Cover team just picked up Fayed.
- Do you think he bought it?

15:45.720 --> 15:48.553
We'll know soon enough.

15:53.360 --> 15:56.796
- Is the AVfeed up yet?
- We're almost there.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.319
- Agent Doyle, you're bleeding.
- I must have cut myself in the crash.

16:05.400 --> 16:10.633
- Mike, do you need medical assistance?
- No, it's superficial. Thanks for your concern.

16:10.720 --> 16:14.235
- Jack, I'm patching it through to you now.
- Copy that.

16:17.360 --> 16:21.672
(man) Talit, take evasive measures.
Keep off the main streets.

16:21.760 --> 16:25.070
(man speaks Arabic language)

16:30.840 --> 16:36.278
My name is Jamal Nasawa. We're with
the Al-Tahireen cell. General Habib sent us.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.033
- The general?
- Yes.

16:39.120 --> 16:43.079
- How did you find me?
- Through contacts in American intelligence.

16:43.160 --> 16:46.470
He learned of your route
and ordered us to intercept.

16:46.560 --> 16:50.553
He wants us to help you
rendezvous with your men.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.796
Give me a gun.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.667
I want to speak to him - General Habib.

17:20.760 --> 17:23.194
- That's not possible at the moment.
- Why not?

17:23.280 --> 17:26.636
He's under tight scrutiny
by the government. It's not safe.

17:26.720 --> 17:31.840
He said he'll call us when he can.
Fayed, where do you want us to take you?

17:32.440 --> 17:35.671
I'll let you know after I speak to the general.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.074
As you wish.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.948
Bill, did you copy? Fayed's not
going anywhere unless he talks to Habib.

17:42.040 --> 17:46.556
- I don't know if I can make that happen.
- We've got to, otherwise this falls through.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.200
We have no other way to find the bombs.

17:49.280 --> 17:53.831
I'll call the White House.
We need to involve the president.

18:10.440 --> 18:13.876
I've got Bill Buchanan on the phone.
I'm patching him through.

18:13.960 --> 18:18.829
Bill, you're on speaker with Tom Lennox
and myself. So what's the situation?

18:18.920 --> 18:24.233
Jack wasn't able to extract any information
from Fayed. He considered it a dead end.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.471
Consequently, we implemented a plan
intended to trick Fayed

18:27.560 --> 18:30.028
into leading us to the suitcase nukes.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.278
- What sort of plan?
- We staged a fake rescue of Fayed

18:33.360 --> 18:37.353
by CTU agents posing as members
of a terrorist cell with loyalties to Habib.

18:37.440 --> 18:41.353
We hoped that Fayed would lead us
to wherever his men are holed up.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.874
- But he hasn't, right?
- No, sir.

18:43.960 --> 18:47.953
Fayed is stalling
until he can get confirmation from Habib

18:48.040 --> 18:50.270
that these men are taking orders from him.

18:50.360 --> 18:54.353
- He wants to speak to the general, sir.
- Habib is still being interrogated.

18:54.440 --> 18:57.512
We don't know how cooperative he's being
or even if he will be.

18:57.600 --> 19:01.957
I appreciate that, sir. Our agents on the inside
are trying to circumvent his request,

19:02.040 --> 19:05.828
but Jack believes Fayed will not
lead us to the location of the nukes

19:05.920 --> 19:08.354
unless he speaks directly to the general.

19:09.400 --> 19:14.793
- Where is the ambassador now?
- He just arrived. Karen is meeting him.

19:14.880 --> 19:19.476
I'll do my best to pressure the ambassador.
Maybe they can force Habib to make that call.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.836
Keep doing what you can,
just in case I'm not successful.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.478
Yes, sir. We'll keep you apprised.

19:24.560 --> 19:27.279
- All right.
- Sir, if this ruse isn't working,

19:27.360 --> 19:31.672
we might be better off getting information
out of Fayed by conventional means.

19:31.760 --> 19:35.469
If Jack Bauer says that's a dead end,
then I believe him.

19:35.560 --> 19:41.192
- Let's not keep the ambassador waiting.
- Whoa! Are you all right, sir?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.271
I'm fine.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.355
- Ambassador.
- Mr President.

19:58.440 --> 20:02.797
The prime minister has asked me to convey
his gratitude to you for stopping the attack,

20:02.880 --> 20:06.077
and his relief that a catastrophe
was narrowly avoided.

20:06.160 --> 20:12.395
Don't get too comfortable, Mr Ambassador,
because there may be one yet. Sit down.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.399
Let me get right to the point.

20:18.480 --> 20:23.315
At this very moment, Abu Fayed is travelling
with CTU agents posing as a terrorist cell

20:23.400 --> 20:25.436
allied with General Habib.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.512
- You have Fayed?
- Yeah, but not the suitcase nukes.

20:28.600 --> 20:33.390
The problem is, Fayed will not rendezvous
with his men until he speaks to that general,

20:33.480 --> 20:36.995
presumably to confirm the legitimacy
of our undercover agents.

20:37.080 --> 20:39.548
So we need that phone call to take place now.

20:39.640 --> 20:43.474
I appreciate your dilemma
and I will gladly pass on your request,

20:43.560 --> 20:48.111
but I'm not sure the general will be
accommodating. He has proven stubborn.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.998
Perhaps you should be
a little bit more persuasive.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.789
I resent your tone. I don't need you
to tell me how dire the situation is.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.871
This is not a moment for indignation.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.919
It's your country's own inactions
that have brought us to this point.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.549
I can assure you every effort
is being made to get information from him.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.279
We have even arrested his family.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.715
Have you threatened to kill them?

21:12.440 --> 21:14.556
- I beg your pardon?
- Mr President...

21:14.640 --> 21:19.873
These are desperate times. I spared you a
nuclear strike that would've killed thousands.

21:19.960 --> 21:25.080
What is your country willing to do to ensure
that another bomb does not go off in mine?

21:25.160 --> 21:29.676
- What you're suggesting is barbaric.
- I know how your country treats dissonance.

21:29.760 --> 21:32.558
Don't you dare speak to me of barbarism.

21:33.560 --> 21:37.917
I don't care how you do it,
but General Habib needs to call Fayed

21:38.000 --> 21:43.120
and give him his orders directly,
without compromising CTU's operation.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.070
You'll make the call now.

21:58.120 --> 22:03.148
If Habib makes the call, it'll be to Jamal's
phone, but the general doesn't speak English.

22:03.240 --> 22:07.711
I'll set up a separate channel
and translate their conversation.

22:09.520 --> 22:13.479
Milo, I need you to uplink a proprietary
channel on socket D to my terminal.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.518
I can't. I'm busy.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.798
- Why don't you just do it yourself?
- I don't have level-five security clearance.

22:20.880 --> 22:24.350
It hasn't stopped you before, now has it?

22:24.440 --> 22:27.955
Milo, is there something on your mind?

22:28.040 --> 22:32.636
I... just don't get it. A few hours ago,
Doyle was threatening you, hurting you.

22:32.720 --> 22:35.109
Now you two are best buddies.

22:35.200 --> 22:40.228
Just because I show concern for an injured
field agent, it doesn't make us friends.

22:40.320 --> 22:43.118
Milo, besides, he might not be as bad
as you think he is.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.476
No, he is. The guy's a creep and a sadist.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.915
I don't have time. I can have Chloe do it.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.673
That's it? That's all you're gonna say?

22:51.760 --> 22:54.149
Let go of me.

22:56.200 --> 23:00.955
Psst. I know it's none of my business,
but do we have a bit of a problem?

23:04.800 --> 23:06.791
No.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.757
- I'll set up your channel.
- Thank you.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.597
- Are you all right, love?
- Yeah, thanks.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.477
Don't mention it.

23:38.040 --> 23:41.635
Pull into that garage up there.
We'll wait there.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.351
(Jack) Right over here.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.432
Fayed, I understand your caution,

24:07.520 --> 24:10.637
but we can'tjust sit
while the Americans are looking for us.

24:10.720 --> 24:15.396
I told you, we're not going any further
until the general calls.

24:18.880 --> 24:23.396
Tell me, Jamal, if you take your orders
from General Habib as I do,

24:23.480 --> 24:25.869
how is it I've never heard of you or your cell?

24:25.960 --> 24:28.315
- This is going south, Jack.
- Be patient.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.834
Don't be a fool, Fayed.
You know how this works.

24:30.920 --> 24:34.117
Every cell is autonomous,
without knowledge of the others.

24:34.200 --> 24:38.318
It is the only way we can protect ourselves
and our operation if we get captured.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.630
(phone rings)

24:41.400 --> 24:43.516
Yes?

24:43.600 --> 24:46.558
(speaks Arabic language)

24:47.440 --> 24:49.715
The general.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.392
- Hello.
- Fayed.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.552
(speaks Arabic language)

25:00.640 --> 25:04.155
"Fayed, I can't speak long.
I suspect I'm being watched."

25:04.240 --> 25:06.708
- (speaks Arabic language)
- "So I was told."

25:06.800 --> 25:10.679
"General, these men who rescued me,
did you send them?"

25:15.880 --> 25:17.313
(speaks Arabic language)

25:17.400 --> 25:19.152
"Of course I sent them."

25:20.640 --> 25:22.995
"Do you still have the bombs?"

25:23.080 --> 25:26.959
"There are two left.
They're with Halil at a safe house."

25:27.040 --> 25:29.031
"Why haven't you used them?"

25:30.640 --> 25:34.918
"The Russian, Gredenko, failed to provide us
with the means to a secondary target."

25:35.000 --> 25:36.672
(speaks Arabic language)

25:36.760 --> 25:38.876
"You failed, Fayed."

25:41.200 --> 25:44.397
"We should've sent Sameer in your place."

25:47.280 --> 25:49.669
"Are the bombs operational?"

25:49.760 --> 25:51.716
"They are."

25:51.800 --> 25:53.552
"Good."

25:53.640 --> 25:57.474
"Connect with your men...
get the bombs ready to move out."

25:57.560 --> 25:59.630
"Call me back at this number."

26:00.840 --> 26:05.391
"By then, I will have chosen
a new target for you. Do you understand?"

26:05.480 --> 26:06.595
"Yes, General."

26:08.160 --> 26:09.513
Are we good?

26:10.640 --> 26:15.191
The safe house isn't far.
Head east toward the 110 freeway.

26:17.520 --> 26:19.988
- The target vehicle is moving.
- Copy that, Jack.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.833
Looks like it worked.
I'll let the White House know.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.311
Let's go.

26:45.280 --> 26:47.111
Mr President?

26:48.120 --> 26:49.678
Hm?

26:49.760 --> 26:53.230
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine, Karen.

26:53.960 --> 26:57.157
Just a... I'm just a little tired.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.993
Mr President, I just got word from CTU.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.753
The general's call
appears to have satisfied Fayed.

27:02.840 --> 27:06.355
- He's leading them to the bombs.
- Oh, thank God.

27:07.360 --> 27:10.591
I'm pleased we were able to help,
Mr President.

27:10.680 --> 27:15.470
So am I. Karen, would you please
show the ambassador to his car?

27:15.560 --> 27:16.788
Yes, Mr President.

27:16.880 --> 27:20.270
Forgive me, Mr President.
I believe you asked me to remain here...

27:20.360 --> 27:22.715
That won't be necessary any longer.

27:22.800 --> 27:27.635
- Thank you again for your cooperation.
- Of course, Mr President.

27:32.920 --> 27:35.195
- You handled him well, sir.
- The door, Tom.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.953
- Excuse me, sir?
- The door... lock it.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.952
- Mr President.
- No one can know.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.031
Mr President!

28:01.280 --> 28:03.840
Shadow teams for Bauer and Doyle
are standing by.

28:03.920 --> 28:06.309
They'll advance
when Fayed is at the safe house.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.631
No one moves until Jack confirms
that the nukes are there.

28:09.720 --> 28:14.748
Make sure Fayed's vehicle and the follow car
have a wide berth - nothing to tip Fayed off.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.558
Right.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.790
- Sir, I think we have a problem.
- What?

28:18.880 --> 28:22.668
The transcript between Habib and Fayed -
there's an inconsistency.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.877
- The general spoke of a man named Sameer.
- That's right.

28:25.960 --> 28:29.794
Sameer Al-Afted served on the general's staff
throughout the '90s.

28:29.880 --> 28:33.270
He was implicated in money laundering
for radical organisations.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.112
That's probably the guy.

28:35.200 --> 28:40.035
The problem is, Sameer Al-Afted was killed
two years ago in a raid by Afghan forces.

28:40.120 --> 28:43.590
But the general spoke about him
as if he were alive.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.150
- He could be referring to another Sameer.
- Or it could be a code.

28:47.240 --> 28:50.596
I think the general was telling Fayed
he was speaking under duress.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.671
I'd better warn Jack and Doyle.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.228
Nadia... good work.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.355
Jack, they're turning north onto Adams.

29:00.440 --> 29:05.434
We just detected what might be a duress code
in the conversation between Habib and Fayed.

29:05.520 --> 29:09.991
- Give me the specifics.
- The general mentioned Sameer Al-Afted.

29:10.080 --> 29:13.117
But Sameer's been dead for two years.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.998
- I'll call Jamal.
- If they're wrong, you could blow this.

29:19.080 --> 29:23.676
If they're right, this is already over.
Now, give me your phone!

29:27.200 --> 29:29.191
(phone rings)

29:31.240 --> 29:32.229
Yes?

29:32.320 --> 29:34.993
This is Agent Bauer.
I'm in the follow vehicle behind.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.719
- I need you to listen very carefully.
- Go ahead.

29:37.800 --> 29:41.190
We believe General Habib
may have given Fayed a distress signal.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.874
Fayed might know that this is a setup.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.112
- Jamal?
- (static)

29:47.200 --> 29:50.237
Jamal, do you copy?

29:50.320 --> 29:53.869
Dammit! What the hell just happened?
CTU, we just lost video and audio.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.793
They went into a tunnel.
It may just be interference.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.111
- How long is it?
- (Chloe) Checking.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.679
Only 120 yards.

30:01.760 --> 30:05.435
- They should've come out by now.
- Copy that. Aerial One, this is Jack Bauer.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.512
We lost the target vehicle.
It entered a tunnel on Adams.

30:08.600 --> 30:13.355
- Seal off the north end. We're going in.
- (man) Roger that.

30:20.360 --> 30:26.708
We've got a visual on the target vehicle.
It stopped in the tunnel. We're gonna engage.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.797
Dead.

30:46.840 --> 30:51.118
- They're both dead.
- Jamal's alive. Stay with him. Call in a medic.

30:51.200 --> 30:56.274
Aerial One, did you see anything leave
the north end? Aerial One, do you copy?

30:56.360 --> 30:58.237
(man) Aerial One, negative.

31:15.160 --> 31:17.355
(metallic clink)

31:26.960 --> 31:28.951
(heavy breathing)

31:33.920 --> 31:36.195
(dials number)

31:40.600 --> 31:43.068
It's me. I'm on my way to you now.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.991
I'll explain when I get there.

32:20.920 --> 32:22.717
Bill, it's Jack! Do you copy?

32:22.800 --> 32:27.590
- Jack, go ahead.
- Fayed is in a sanitation truck headed east!

32:28.400 --> 32:30.391
Jack, say again. We didn't get that.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.870
Dammit!

32:33.960 --> 32:35.712
(crackling)

32:35.800 --> 32:38.633
Jack? Jack?

32:40.000 --> 32:43.356
No contact from Agent Doyle.
Aerial One says they're in the tunnel.

32:43.440 --> 32:46.398
Send the call to audio forensics
to pull what Jack said.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.950
Chloe, replay the satellite feed.
Back-time it 60 seconds.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.235
Yes, sir.

32:55.440 --> 33:00.673
Bill, this is Doyle. I don't have a 20 on Jack,
but I have a dead body at the loading dock.

33:30.360 --> 33:35.070
- Doctor, what is happening to him?
- His blood pressure's dropped to 80 over 40.

33:35.160 --> 33:39.312
It could be any number of things -
vascular damage from the adrenaline shot,

33:39.400 --> 33:40.879
intracranial swelling.

33:40.960 --> 33:43.394
Mr President,
we have to get you down to Medical.

33:43.480 --> 33:46.517
No. No, I'm not going anywhere.

33:49.720 --> 33:53.269
Just give me another shot of adrenaline.

33:53.360 --> 33:56.238
No, sir. Another injection would kill you.

33:56.320 --> 34:01.440
I should never have given you that last one.
I won't make that mistake again. I'm sorry.

34:08.239 --> 34:11.869
- Sir, what are you doing?
- I'm going back to work.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.474
Please listen to him.
Let him perform some tests.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.915
When this is over and the nukes are secured.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.391
- In my opinion, you won't last that long.
- I might surprise you.

34:23.760 --> 34:29.471
Mr President, if you don't get down to
Medical now, you can have my resignation.

34:29.560 --> 34:34.509
I won't accept your resignation,
Arthur, so don't bother.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.431
Will you excuse us?

34:44.719 --> 34:49.554
- For God's sake, talk some sense into him.
- It is his decision.

34:55.159 --> 34:58.516
Tom... call CTU.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.152
- I wanna know what's happening.
- All right, sir.

35:04.240 --> 35:05.514
All right.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.913
What's going on, Brother Fayed?
What happened?

35:45.000 --> 35:48.470
Gredenko betrayed us.
He led CTU right to me.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.677
- What?
- They may be tracking me. It's not safe here.

35:51.760 --> 35:54.479
- Load the bombs onto the truck.
- Where are we going?

35:54.560 --> 35:58.872
To finish this. We're going to take out
downtown Los Angeles.

35:58.960 --> 36:03.033
Let's move. You wait here.
You guys, come with me.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.270
(shouting in Arabic language)

38:57.920 --> 39:00.115
Say hello to your brother.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.799
(helicopter approaches)

39:40.640 --> 39:42.631
Jack. Jack.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.512
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.509
- How did you find me?
- We tracked the sanitation truck by satellite.

39:52.600 --> 39:56.832
- The bombs are on the table.
- CTU, this is Doyle. We're on site.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.956
(Buchanan) Go ahead, Mike.

39:59.400 --> 40:03.109
The bombs are secure and Jack's all right.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.668
Repeat, the bombs are secure.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.389
Damn, Jack.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.550
Let's get you to Medical.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.235
- I'm fine.
- (phone rings)

40:26.280 --> 40:27.713
Doyle.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.670
You've got a call. It's been routed
through the CTU switchboard.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.751
Thanks.

40:42.880 --> 40:45.838
This is Bauer.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.798
Hello? Hello?

40:48.880 --> 40:50.871
(Audrey) Jack...

40:50.960 --> 40:52.871
Are you there?

40:53.440 --> 40:56.637
- Can you hear me?
- Audrey?

40:58.760 --> 41:02.116
Help me, Jack, please. Help me.

41:02.680 --> 41:08.118
- What the hell is going on? Where are you?
- Hello, Mr Bauer. Yes, Ms Raines is alive.

41:08.200 --> 41:15.311
If you wish her to remain that way, you will
call me back in ten minutes at 310-597-3781

41:15.400 --> 41:17.391
on a secure line.

41:17.480 --> 41:21.553
If you make any attempt
to find our location, she dies.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.913
Cheng? Cheng?!
