I AM REALLY SORRY ABOUT THIS,

11:58.385 --> 12:00.754
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED

12:00.754 --> 12:03.223
RIGHT BEFORE YOU TOLD
YOUR MOTHER OFF.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.332
OKAY.

12:12.332 --> 12:15.002
[ GUITAR PLAYING ]

12:15.668 --> 12:18.438
GEORGE. GEORGE.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.240
GEORGE!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.242
GO ACROSS THE STREET
AND GET ME SOME SMOKES.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.377
MOM, I'M PRACTICING.
WA-CHA.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.016
THAT'S WHERE THE TEAR
COMES OUT. WA-CHA.

12:31.118 --> 12:34.454
I NEVER GET TIRED OF HEARING
THAT CHORD.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.257
I'M GOING.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.493
AND DON'T STOP TO LOOK
AT THE DIRTY MAGAZINES.

12:42.229 --> 12:45.032
MOM, NOT IN FRONT
OF MY WIFE.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.467
I CAN'T DO NOTHING.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.839
I HATE THE WAY
YOU TALK TO HIM.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.340
HE IS GONNA BE A FATHER,

12:53.340 --> 12:56.043
AND YOU STILL TREAT HIM
LIKE HE'S A CHILD.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.978
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.413
OH, YEAH?
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GO?

13:00.413 --> 13:03.150
YOU DON'T HAVE TWO CENTS
TO YOUR NAME.

13:03.150 --> 13:06.219
WELL, I COULD SWALLOW MY PRIDE
AND CALL MY DAD IN MIAMI.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.487
WE COULD STAY WITH HIM,

13:07.487 --> 13:09.289
AND HE COULD GET US JOBS
AT THE HOSPITAL.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.424
GEORGE ISN'T GOING
TO MIAMI.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.961
HE'S NOT GONNA LEAVE
THIS HOUSE.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.830
I SAY HE IS.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.266
I'M HIS WIFE AND THE MOTHER
OF HIS CHILD.

13:19.266 --> 13:22.502
LET'S SEE WHO HE LISTENS TO
WHEN HE GETS BACK.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.773
OKAY.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.708
OKAY, PRINCESS.

13:28.708 --> 13:32.913
DON'T GET YOUR BIG-GIRL PANTIES
IN A BUNCH.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.048
YOU KNOW,
THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.449
I COULD GIVE YOU SOME MONEY

13:36.449 --> 13:38.485
SO YOU COULD GET
A PLACE IN L.A.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.621
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE US MONEY?
YEAH, RIGHT.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.591
HEY, I DON'T WANT YOU HERE
WHEN THAT BABY COMES.

13:44.591 --> 13:48.461
IF ANYBODY IS GONNA CRAWL AROUND
THIS HOUSE WITH A BOTTLE,

13:48.461 --> 13:50.430
IT'S GONNA BE ME.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.676
H-HOW MUCH IS THIS?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.512
5 GRAND.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.981
BENNY, UH, THANK YOU.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.250
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.385
JUST KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.022
DON'T TELL ANYBODY
WHAT'S IN THIS BOOK

14:15.022 --> 14:17.891
OR I WILL KILL YOU
WITH WHAT'S IN THAT BOOK.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.461
GEORGE CAN'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.031
HE'D BE MAD AT ME FOR TAKING
MONEY BEHIND HIS BACK.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.432
MAKE SOMETHING UP.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.634
YOU TOLD HIM YOU COULD HANDLE
THE BIRTH CONTROL,

14:27.634 --> 14:28.868
AND HE BELIEVED THAT.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.739
BUT I WANT HIM TO WALK
OUT OF HERE LIKE A MAN,

14:32.739 --> 14:35.508
NOT BECAUSE HIS WIFE FOUND
MONEY AND TOLD HIM TO GO.

14:35.508 --> 14:39.012
SO I'LL MAKE HIM MAD ENOUGH
TO WANT TO LEAVE.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.381
OKAY.
I'LL KICK IT UP A NOTCH.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.483
YOU MEAN
YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING BACK?

14:47.921 --> 14:49.589
CLEAN IT UP, STUPID.

14:56.263 --> 15:00.033
SO, THE MOMENT I THOUGHT
I BECAME A MAN WAS ALL FAKE?

15:01.501 --> 15:03.903
IT WAS YOU AND MY MOM
PLAYING ME.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.639
I WAS TRYING TO HELP,
GEORGE.

15:06.639 --> 15:09.509
WHAT ELSE WAS PLANNED
BEHIND MY BACK, HUH?

15:09.509 --> 15:12.645
DID YOU AND MY MOM ARRANGE
MY PROMOTION TO MANAGER?

15:12.645 --> 15:14.781
THAT TOOK 15 YEARS, BABY.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.749
THAT WAS ALL YOU.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.291
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.493
LOOK, SORRY DOESN'T CUT IT

15:26.493 --> 15:30.030
WHEN YOU GO BEHIND MY BACK
AND TAKE MONEY FROM MY MOM.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.932
WAIT A SECOND.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.768
IF SHE GAVE YOU
THE 5 GRAND,

15:35.768 --> 15:42.275
THAT MEANS YOU NEVER MET
TOMMY LEE AT THE DRY CLEANERS.

15:45.478 --> 15:50.117
YOU NEVER SOLD MY POWER BALLAD
TO MOTLEY CRUE.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.952
IT NEVER MADE THE CHARTS
IN GERMANY, DID IT?

15:52.952 --> 15:56.056
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.

15:56.056 --> 15:59.459
YOU BECAME A WONDERFUL FATHER
AND HUSBAND.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.461
PLUS YOU'RE PRETTY DAMN GOOD
IN THE SACK,

16:01.461 --> 16:03.130
AND I'M NOT JUST
SAYING THAT.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.134
MORE LIES!

16:09.136 --> 16:11.338
ANGIE, I'VE BEEN LIED TO
SO MUCH IN MY LIFE.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.340
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S TRUE ANYMORE.

16:13.340 --> 16:17.577
IS THIS A BOX FULL OF MEMORIES
OR LIES?

16:20.280 --> 16:23.150
WAS I REALLY THE CHAMPION
SPAGHETTI EATER

16:23.150 --> 16:24.517
IN THE THIRD GRADE?

16:24.517 --> 16:27.087
DID I EARN THE GOLDEN NOODLE?

16:30.557 --> 16:33.160
DID MY LITTLE LEAGUE COACH
REALLY LEAVE ME

16:33.160 --> 16:34.861
$10,000 ON HIS DEATHBED?

16:34.861 --> 16:38.598
SOMEONE LEFT YOU $10,000?

16:38.598 --> 16:41.968
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS CARD
BEFORE.

16:41.968 --> 16:44.071
"GEORGIE,
I HOPE THIS $10,000

16:44.071 --> 16:46.173
"MAKES A DIFFERENCE
IN YOUR LIFE.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.608
"I PUT THE CHECK
IN YOUR MOM'S NAME

16:48.608 --> 16:51.511
BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY 12,
BUT IT'S YOUR MONEY."

16:54.047 --> 16:56.249
ANGIE, HE NEVER CALLED.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.717
BUT WE WEREN'T HOME ANYWAY.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.553
THAT WAS THE WEEK MY MOM TOOK ME
TO VEGAS IN HER NEW CAR.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.259
OH, NO!

17:16.803 --> 17:18.105
WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU?

17:18.105 --> 17:20.006
I TOLD THE TRUTH.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.907
OKAY.

17:21.907 --> 17:24.577
WELL, NOW THAT YOU KNOW
THAT I GAVE YOU MONEY,

17:24.577 --> 17:26.079
YOU CAN START PAYING IT BACK.

17:26.079 --> 17:29.549
$1,000.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:29.549 --> 17:32.752
IN THE MEMO YOU CAN WRITE,
"FOR BEING THE BESTEST MOMMY."

17:35.155 --> 17:37.557
THAT REALLY DOESN'T COVER
WHAT YOU MEAN TO ME.

17:39.092 --> 17:43.796
HOW ABOUT IF I WRITE, "TO THE
MOST EVIL WOMAN IN THE WORLD,

17:43.796 --> 17:46.199
WHO STOLE MONEY
FROM HER OWN SON"?!

17:48.801 --> 17:51.404
CASH WOULD BE BETTER.

17:51.404 --> 17:55.074
I FOUND THE CARD
FROM COACH TREVINO.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.645
'MEMBER?
YOU 'MEMBER.

18:01.214 --> 18:04.117
MOM, YOU STOLE
$10,000 FROM ME.

18:04.117 --> 18:08.221
NO, I DIDN'T.
I GAVE ANGIE $10,000.

18:08.221 --> 18:11.324
YOU GAVE ME $5,000.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.593
YOUR LYING IS BECOMING
A SICKNESS.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.865
MOM, THAT MONEY WAS
FOR MY FUTURE.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.168
I COULD'VE GOTTEN A TUTOR
FOR MY DYSLEXIA.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.402
I COULD'VE GONE TO COLLEGE.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.770
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.173
BECAUSE YOU SAID
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.774
WHERE DID THE MONEY GO?

18:27.774 --> 18:30.710
GEORGE, I PUT FOOD ON YOUR
PLATE, A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.580
WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY YOU EARNED
FROM WORKING TWO JOBS?

18:33.580 --> 18:35.815
WELL, I WAS SAVING IT
FOR YOUR COLLEGE.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.217
I DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.085
WELL, THEN,
WHY WAS I WORKING TWO JOBS?

18:39.085 --> 18:41.721
LOOK...

18:41.721 --> 18:44.457
WE'RE JUST TALKING
IN CIRCLES HERE.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.892
THE MONEY IS GONE.

18:45.892 --> 18:51.631
YOU KNOW, MOM, YOU DIDN'T
JUST TAKE MONEY FROM ME.

18:51.631 --> 18:55.134
YOU TOOK THE MOMENT
I THOUGHT I BECAME A MAN.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.471
THAT'S IT.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.040
I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN
FOR THE LAST TIME.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.477
I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.846
I SHOULD'VE LET YOU GO
TO FLORIDA.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.215
YEAH, WHY DIDN'T YOU?

19:08.215 --> 19:09.649
THEN YOU COULD'VE KEPT
ALL THE MONEY

19:09.649 --> 19:11.384
AND GOTTEN ME
OUT OF YOUR LIFE FOREVER.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.653
MAYBE THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WANTED.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.757
THEN WHAT DID YOU WANT?

19:17.757 --> 19:19.091
FORGET IT.

19:19.091 --> 19:21.294
WHAT, YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
TO LEAVE?

19:23.963 --> 19:26.366
YOUR LIPS AREN'T MOVING,
SO I KNOW YOU'RE NOT LYING.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.239
YOU WOULD'VE MISSED ME.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.140
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST SAY THAT?

19:34.140 --> 19:36.343
YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.177
I GOT TO GO
MAKE 1,000 BUCKS.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.414
I'M GONNA GO FLIP OFF
A COP.

19:41.414 --> 19:44.183
AND I'M GONNA TAKE HIM
ON A HIGH-SPEED CHASE

19:44.183 --> 19:46.386
AND HOPE THAT
WHEN HE CATCHES ME,

19:46.386 --> 19:50.022
HE BEATS ME
INTO THE BIG BUCKS.

19:50.022 --> 19:55.194
I'LL WRITE YOU THE CHECK, IF YOU
SAY YOU DIDN'T WANT ME TO LEAVE.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.399
I'D RATHER TAKE THE BEATING.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.637
THAT WAY I WON'T REMEMBER
THIS CRAP TOMORROW.

20:04.637 --> 20:08.275
I'LL WRITE YOU THE CHECK, THEN
I'LL HIT YOU WITH A SHOVEL.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.711
ALL RIGHT.
WRITE THE CHECK.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.347
NO, YOU SAY IT FIRST, AND THEN
I'LL WRITE THE CHECK.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.485
WE DO IT
AT THE SAME TIME.

20:23.556 --> 20:29.195
IF YOU WOULD'VE MOVED
TO FLORIDA,

20:29.195 --> 20:31.431
I WOULD HAVE...

20:38.405 --> 20:40.673
MISSED YOU.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.012
THANK YOU.

20:46.012 --> 20:50.783
YOU JUST BOUGHT A KIND WORD
FROM YOUR MOM FOR $1,000.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.754
SHUT UP.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.325
THERE'S AN EXTRA $100 IN IT

20:58.325 --> 21:01.461
IF YOU TAKE ME TO THE ZOO
AND BUY ME A BALLOON.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.367
WOW.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.369
SHE STOLE FROM YOU,

21:09.369 --> 21:13.840
BUT SHE FINALLY ADMITTED
SHE NEEDS YOU AROUND.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.009
HOW DOES
THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

21:17.009 --> 21:19.512
YOU'RE NOT OFF THE HOOK.

21:19.512 --> 21:31.524
DAMN IT.
I CAN'T DO NOTHING.
