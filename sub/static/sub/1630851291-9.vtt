Caroline went on a mission,
went to byu,

09:34.858 --> 09:37.375
and now caroline
and her husband have decided

09:37.377 --> 09:39.361
that being mormon
isn't for them.

09:39.363 --> 09:41.696
We should really toast to, like,
burning in hell today.

09:41.698 --> 09:43.181
-Yeah, to being...
-[laughter]

09:43.183 --> 09:44.349
-outer darkness.
-To outer darkness!

09:44.351 --> 09:45.650
-Outer darkness.
-[laughter]

09:45.652 --> 09:48.036
outer darkness is
the lowest degree of heaven

09:48.038 --> 09:50.372
in the mormon faith.
You have the celestial degree

09:50.374 --> 09:51.656
which is for
the tried and trues.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.375
Then you have an exception
for those

09:53.377 --> 09:54.542
that can't make it all the way.

09:54.544 --> 09:57.579
That's the terrestrial.
That's like your lisa barlows,

09:57.581 --> 10:01.199
your, you know, people that just
weren't valiant in their faith.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.035
And then you have the telestial
which is your serial killers,

10:04.037 --> 10:06.755
borderline murderers,
pretty much awful people,

10:06.757 --> 10:08.923
and then you have outer darkness
who are people like me

10:08.925 --> 10:10.892
that have accepted the gospel,
been married in the temple,

10:10.894 --> 10:14.346
made all the covenants,
and then chosen to walk away.

10:14.348 --> 10:16.431
So, like, I would have to ask
jeffrey dahmer

10:16.433 --> 10:20.018
to get me into his degree
of heaven.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.853
When was the first time
you drank?

10:21.855 --> 10:25.824
Um...It was about
I wanna say two months ago.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.192
Two months ago.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.593
She was so nervous about,
like...

10:28.595 --> 10:29.894
-The effect it would have on me.
-Yeah.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.396
-Oh, okay.
-I don't know.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.765
-Yeah, that makes sense.
-So we just picked up vodka.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.167
Oh, yeah, that was the first
thing we tried was vodka.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.086
Listen, I'm a fan.
But you're not a fan.

10:38.088 --> 10:39.671
-I know. No, we are not a fan.
-Yeah, and we're like, okay,

10:39.673 --> 10:41.840
how much do we have
to dilute this down

10:41.842 --> 10:44.009
to, like, drink it?
-[laughs]

10:44.011 --> 10:45.176
-and then we did do a shot.
-Is that--

10:45.178 --> 10:46.628
we were like,
we gotta just do it.

10:46.630 --> 10:48.046
-Get it in.
-Get it in.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.298
Was that, like, your first
openly defiant thing?

10:50.300 --> 10:51.099
-Yeah.
-Really?

10:51.101 --> 10:54.085
-Yeah.
-When you sent me the text

10:54.087 --> 10:55.286
saying you're having
a faith crisis,

10:55.288 --> 10:56.755
I, like, threw my phone
across the room.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.857
-I didn't read that!
-[laughs]

10:58.859 --> 11:01.443
caroline was, like,
completely 100% believe...

11:01.445 --> 11:02.760
-Yeah, no doubt.
-...Until, like,

11:02.762 --> 11:04.312
four or five months ago.
Maybe--maybe--

11:04.314 --> 11:06.398
so it's only four or five months
ago that you had doubts?

11:06.400 --> 11:08.700
-Mm-hmm.
-What started it?

11:08.702 --> 11:10.035
When he opened up

11:10.037 --> 11:11.769
about some of the things
that had bothered him,

11:11.771 --> 11:13.455
I didn't get it at first.
-Oh.

11:13.457 --> 11:17.242
And then after we'd been married
and we were locked down

11:17.244 --> 11:19.477
and spending
all of our time together,

11:19.479 --> 11:22.280
ultimately we started
talking about those things,

11:22.282 --> 11:26.784
and I started to understand why
he was so uncomfortable

11:26.786 --> 11:30.755
with certain doctrine
or certain practices

11:30.757 --> 11:35.293
or why he was doubtful of--
of different leaders and stuff.

11:35.295 --> 11:38.930
Oh, this prophet--like, why
didn't he help us during covid

11:38.932 --> 11:40.631
or, like,
why was the church so late

11:40.633 --> 11:42.067
on blacks in the priesthood?

11:42.069 --> 11:44.402
And, like, why was the church
so late on gay rights?

11:44.404 --> 11:46.404
To me, my narrative was

11:46.406 --> 11:50.141
the church will, you know,
come around, but--

11:50.143 --> 11:51.493
and eventually catch up
with humanity.

11:51.495 --> 11:53.495
-Culture.
-They would catch up.

11:53.497 --> 11:55.697
But if it's really
the true church,

11:55.699 --> 11:56.981
we should be leading...

11:56.983 --> 11:58.917
-Social change.
-The world, yeah.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.085
-Social change.
-Yeah.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.670

you've left?

12:02.672 --> 12:05.006
-Like, you have, like...
-Absolutely.

12:05.008 --> 12:06.758
-Not looking back.
-You know what I did?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.693
You're not gonna look back and
turn into a pillar of salt...

12:08.695 --> 12:11.012
-No.
-...And change your conviction?

12:11.014 --> 12:15.049
The weirdest thing is
when I lost my testimony,

12:15.051 --> 12:18.269
when it shattered,
that was it.

12:18.271 --> 12:21.356
I mean, outside looking in,
I was everything

12:21.358 --> 12:22.941
that anybody wanted me to be
in the church.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.810
But personally, I didn't do it
for the right reasons.

12:25.812 --> 12:28.730
I was doing it
because I was supposed to.

12:28.732 --> 12:34.202
And so when I learned
that it wasn't true,

12:34.204 --> 12:36.687
I felt off the hook.
I felt like I could actually

12:36.689 --> 12:38.356
be my own self.
-Be you.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.526

My sister-in-law didn't get
married in the mormon temple,

12:44.030 --> 12:45.497

of her bridesmaids

12:45.499 --> 12:48.550
to wear these beautiful
spaghetti strap dresses,

12:48.552 --> 12:51.202

to wear my temple garments

12:51.204 --> 12:53.271
with the dress,
and I was furious.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.374
I threw a huge fit
with the entire family.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.577

a custom bolero jacket

12:59.579 --> 13:01.479

about the product

36:32.691 --> 36:34.140
and the person--I'm not
gonna announce his name,

36:34.142 --> 36:36.826
but that she sent product
to him,

36:36.828 --> 36:38.828
which, whitney,
I wanted to ask you about.

36:38.830 --> 36:39.946
Wait, what?

36:39.948 --> 36:42.165
I see [bleep] getting gifts
from our friend group

36:42.167 --> 36:43.667
on social media.

36:43.669 --> 36:46.703
It was bothering me that,
like, other--other people

36:46.705 --> 36:49.422
that are in our friend group
are supporting him

36:49.424 --> 36:51.791
and sending him gifts.

36:51.793 --> 36:54.211
She brought up that situation
with me,

36:54.213 --> 36:56.379
and then she said,
"are you okay?"

36:56.381 --> 36:57.631
because, you know, like,
basically,

36:57.633 --> 36:59.499
"are your feelings hurt? I know
whitney sent him product."

36:59.501 --> 37:00.867
-[bleep]
-no.

37:00.869 --> 37:03.186
You're misinterpreting
how it was coming off.

37:03.188 --> 37:04.871
No, he reached out to my team

37:04.873 --> 37:07.724
and said, "hey, if whitney ever
wants to do a collaboration,

37:07.726 --> 37:10.860
I'd love to." they screenshotted
it and sent it to me,

37:10.862 --> 37:13.396
and I said,
"oh, no. Absolutely not,"

37:13.398 --> 37:15.865
and then I screenshotted
everything

37:15.867 --> 37:18.235
that he is doing to you online,
and I said,

37:18.237 --> 37:20.870
"please do not communicate
with him. Be very careful.

37:20.872 --> 37:24.023
But if he wants to buy product
and promote iris+beau, fine,

37:24.025 --> 37:26.159
but we are not doing
anything personal."

37:26.161 --> 37:27.210
and thank you for telling me.

37:27.212 --> 37:29.930
Yeah, that's good clarification
'cause he posted,

37:29.932 --> 37:31.030
"thank you, whitney."

37:31.032 --> 37:33.133
lisa, why would you ask
if her feelings were hurt?

37:33.135 --> 37:35.552
You're planting a seed
from the beginning.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.203
-No, I'm not. I wasn't.
-The reason you planted a bug

37:37.205 --> 37:39.723
in jen's ear against me
and invited me, not her--

37:39.725 --> 37:40.907
I didn't plant a bug in her ear.
Don't accuse me

37:40.909 --> 37:43.059
of doing something I didn't do.
I didn't plant a bug.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.878
-I was checking in with her.
-Yeah, you did, 'cause...

37:44.880 --> 37:46.062
-I didn't mean it that way.
-Well, I...

37:46.064 --> 37:49.316
-I was not involved at all.
-That was not the intention.

37:49.318 --> 37:50.900
This is not about me sending

37:50.902 --> 37:52.902
free products
from my skincare line.

37:52.904 --> 37:55.605
This is about lisa barlow
trying to prove

37:55.607 --> 37:57.223
that I'm not a loyal friend
to jen,

37:57.225 --> 37:58.658
because for whatever reason,

37:58.660 --> 38:02.946
she is obsessed with being
jen's number one friend.

38:02.948 --> 38:03.964
I mean, I don't know
what's going on here,

38:03.966 --> 38:06.166
but sometimes people
are invited to something,

38:06.168 --> 38:09.235
and sometimes they're not,
and that's up to the host.

38:09.237 --> 38:13.290
Honestly, it's only because
she had a conversation with me

38:13.292 --> 38:14.874
telling me, like, well,

38:14.876 --> 38:17.377
"how do you feel about whitney
sending the product?"

38:17.379 --> 38:19.129
so then it felt weird to me

38:19.131 --> 38:21.464
that you turn around
and invite whitney, that's it.

38:21.466 --> 38:22.749
It just hurt my feelings.

38:22.751 --> 38:23.933
Why did you invite me
and not jen?

38:23.935 --> 38:25.418
Yeah, why'd you invite whitney
and not jen?

38:25.420 --> 38:26.603
Jen, I'm extremely--

38:26.605 --> 38:27.454
that's what everyone wants
to know.

38:27.456 --> 38:28.955
Why'd you invite whitney
and not jen?

38:28.957 --> 38:30.857
I was extending
an olive branch to whitney.

38:30.859 --> 38:33.760
This is really small.
This was not, like--

38:33.762 --> 38:36.429
-this was not like a big party.
-It's all bullsh--.

38:36.431 --> 38:37.864
It's another pile-on.

38:37.866 --> 38:39.599
It's another reason
to have a problem with me.

38:39.601 --> 38:41.801
I feel like this group
is not gonna be happy

38:41.803 --> 38:44.371
until I choke on my pasta
and die.

38:44.373 --> 38:45.488
I'm not defending
what my kids did..

38:45.490 --> 38:47.474
Again, I don't--and anyways,
that's not the problem.

38:47.476 --> 38:49.793
-I'm so happy with my children.
-[clatter]

38:49.795 --> 38:52.245
that's not the issue.
The issue is just that

38:52.247 --> 38:54.781
you told me about whitney
and then invited her,

38:54.783 --> 38:57.167
and that seemed disingenuous
to me.

38:57.169 --> 38:58.835
You know what?
This event was about my kids.

38:58.837 --> 38:59.952
This was not about jen.
It was not about lisa.

38:59.954 --> 39:01.971
-I never said it was.
-It was not about meredith,

39:01.973 --> 39:04.007
and it was not about anybody
else. It was about my kids.

39:04.009 --> 39:07.427
I am not talking about this
anymore. I am done!

39:07.429 --> 39:08.795
Just say, "I'm sorry"
and mean it

39:08.797 --> 39:11.130
and don't yell and say
it's about your kids!

39:11.132 --> 39:15.735
Jen, I know that hurt you,
and I am very sorry.

39:15.737 --> 39:17.987
Hold on. Excuse me. Can
everyone put their glasses up?

39:17.989 --> 39:21.324
We're--no, no, no, no, no.
We're doing a cheers.

39:21.326 --> 39:23.610
-We're doing a cheers.
-Thank you.

39:23.612 --> 39:26.146
-Cheers.
-And I want you to hear me.

39:26.148 --> 39:29.999
I wanna salute to listening
and accepting, okay?

39:30.001 --> 39:33.853
So that all this tit-tat
can be gone.

39:33.855 --> 39:35.004
We were all about to go
on a trip together.

39:35.006 --> 39:37.757
Let's enjoy each other.

39:37.759 --> 39:39.709
Heather has been, like, amazing

39:39.711 --> 39:42.262
helping me put together
all the fun festivities.

39:42.264 --> 39:43.663
She's paying for everything,

39:43.665 --> 39:44.964
and I'm doing all, like,
the fun.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.833
You know what?
Thanks for inviting jennie.

39:46.835 --> 39:48.768
I think everything's gonna love
having her on the trip.

39:48.770 --> 39:49.853
I'm really excited
that she's coming.

39:49.855 --> 39:52.004
-So she's gonna be great.
-I think it will be great.

39:52.006 --> 39:54.023
-You need to worry about mary.
-Why?

39:54.025 --> 39:57.394
Because jennie's come
after you a little bit.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.529
No, I'll assess.
I do my own observation,

39:59.531 --> 40:01.614
and I'll get to see who she is.

40:01.616 --> 40:05.568
I don't like jennie because...
She gossips,

40:05.570 --> 40:07.787
and she starts trouble.

40:07.789 --> 40:11.357
And she says things, and she
goes back and says things.

40:11.359 --> 40:12.792
She's just a lot like lisa,

40:12.794 --> 40:15.027
and I don't want
two lisa barlows in my life.

40:15.029 --> 40:16.963
One is enough.

40:16.965 --> 40:18.198
I got your back, mary m. Cosby.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.632
No, no, no. Baby--

40:19.634 --> 40:22.001
jen just said she has your back.

40:22.003 --> 40:24.237
No, jen, I wanna know how you
feel about her? I'm curious.

40:24.239 --> 40:25.705
Am I allowed to eat
the tiramisu, or are we--

40:25.707 --> 40:27.540
eat it. I wanna know.

40:27.542 --> 40:28.641
So you're telling me don't worry
about her coming?

40:28.643 --> 40:30.894
-I'm not worried at all.
-Because jen has your back.

40:30.896 --> 40:32.579
-Hold on.
-This is what I'm hearing.

40:32.581 --> 40:34.046
-I--no, mary, don't--
-I don't need you

40:34.048 --> 40:36.065
to explain nothing to me.
I just need to hear jen.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.150
And that's--
I don't need to hear this.

40:37.152 --> 40:39.051
You didn't hear her,
what she said. Say it again.

40:39.053 --> 40:40.286
I don't--'cause I can't hear her
when you're talking over her

40:40.288 --> 40:41.554
and with her.
Like, be quiet for a second.

40:41.556 --> 40:42.655
I wasn't talking over her
at this point.

40:42.657 --> 40:44.124
I don't have a hard time
comprehending.

40:44.126 --> 40:45.091
But you--mary--

40:45.093 --> 40:46.893
I need to know what
jen's saying for myself.

40:46.895 --> 40:47.927
You missed the biggest
key point. You didn't hear her.

40:47.929 --> 40:49.028
You don't need to speak for me.
I don't like it.

40:49.030 --> 40:53.232
But now she's trying--
don't explain nothing to me.

40:53.234 --> 40:54.534
I forgot what you're learning.

40:54.536 --> 40:55.752
-Okay.
-Mary--

40:55.754 --> 40:57.086
y'all were worried about me.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.955
You need to be worried
about this one.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.807
Mary.

41:00.809 --> 41:03.793
Mary has a problem with whitney?
It's like spin the bottle,

41:03.795 --> 41:05.077
and whoever the bottle
lands on--

41:05.079 --> 41:07.297
that's who mary m. Cosby
is going after.

41:07.299 --> 41:09.682
'cause I've been
in whitney's shoes right now,

41:09.684 --> 41:12.268
and it doesn't feel good.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.637
Jen actually offered you
a beautiful moment,

41:14.639 --> 41:16.473
but everyone is talking.

41:16.475 --> 41:18.024
I don't need you
to help me see that.

41:18.026 --> 41:19.108
I don't have a problem
with seeing that.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.927
I don't have a--do you feel
anything with me, jen?

41:20.929 --> 41:22.061
No.

41:22.063 --> 41:23.730
You're talking to me
like I'm a child.

41:23.732 --> 41:25.114
I'm talking to you
for understanding.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.133
Whether you take it as a child,
that's your business.

41:27.135 --> 41:28.067
I'm talking to you
for understanding, sweetheart.

41:28.069 --> 41:30.603
I am not a child.
I'm a very smart woman.

41:30.605 --> 41:33.773
I talk to my son as an adult,
and I'm aiming for direction,

41:33.775 --> 41:35.008
which is understanding.

41:35.010 --> 41:36.476
-Mary...
-I don't do disputes.

41:36.478 --> 41:39.662
And what--what you missed was
jen actually offered you

41:39.664 --> 41:41.714
a very beautiful moment,
and everyone was talking.

41:41.716 --> 41:43.783
I don't need you
to tell me that.

41:43.785 --> 41:45.668
And I just thought
it was a beautiful moment

41:45.670 --> 41:47.554
that I thought
we should all hear.

41:47.556 --> 41:49.255
Mary, take a step back.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.558
See? There she goes,
trying to tell me what to do.

41:51.560 --> 41:53.292
First of all, I am not
a ----ing child.

41:53.294 --> 41:55.011
I have an opinion of this table.
Let's make that clear.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.346
-Oh, lord. This girl...
-Okay, yes.

41:56.348 --> 41:58.097
...Is too insecure.
You're too insecure.

41:58.099 --> 42:00.967
-Grow up. Grow the heck up.
-You called me "little girl."

42:00.969 --> 42:03.102
you are a little girl.
That should be a compliment.

42:04.806 --> 42:05.822
-That is not a compliment.
-It's diminutive.

42:05.824 --> 42:07.306
-It's diminutive.
-That is condescending, mary.

42:07.308 --> 42:08.140
-Why?
-Okay, but wait.

42:08.142 --> 42:09.526
-Hold on right now.
-That's who--

42:09.528 --> 42:10.660
then you don't know mary,

42:10.662 --> 42:12.779
and that's why you didn't
call me back for this event.

42:12.781 --> 42:14.380
-Mary, I was driving carpool...
-Okay.

42:14.382 --> 42:16.916
...For my children.
It is irresponsible...

42:16.918 --> 42:18.835
Don't--don't bring--
bring the voice down.

42:18.837 --> 42:20.169
-...If I facetime in a car.
-Bring your voice down.

42:20.171 --> 42:22.889
You don't yell at me, okay?
Wrong girl.

42:22.891 --> 42:26.659
If I answer a facetime
in a car, that's irresponsible

42:26.661 --> 42:28.428
with other people's children
in the backseat.

42:28.430 --> 42:29.546
Listen, shh, it's okay.

42:29.548 --> 42:32.164
Don't think you're above
nobody else. Don't yell at me.

42:32.166 --> 42:34.934
-I'm not above anything.
-You can go.

42:34.936 --> 42:38.104
-You're not hearing me, mar.
-Little girl.

42:38.106 --> 42:40.189
