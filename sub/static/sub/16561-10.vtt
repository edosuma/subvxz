WEBVTT

00:03.371 --> 00:04.603
Hey, natalie.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.008
I was hoping I could catch you
before my shift started.

00:09.010 --> 00:11.377
Well, you caught me.

00:11.379 --> 00:14.079
So, you want
to do something later?

00:14.081 --> 00:16.215
Maybe grab some dinner?

00:16.216 --> 00:18.350
I was up all night
prepping for the m&m today.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.120
By the time my shift's over,
I'm gonna be running on fumes.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.422
We can keep it mellow.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.357
Make some spaghetti,
watch a movie.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.726
Maybe. We'll see.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.533
Okay, everyone, heads up!
Cpd! Dr. Choi?

00:34.535 --> 00:36.435
Auto versus ped.
Officer kate windham

00:36.437 --> 00:38.237
found unresponsive
in her driveway.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.305
- Who?
- Officer kate windham.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.775
Down for an unknown period.
Tubed in the field.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.309
Mags?

00:44.311 --> 00:45.811
Baghdad.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.048
She was hit in her own driveway?

00:49.050 --> 00:51.083
Freak accident.
Parking brake gave out.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.085
Her suv rolled into her.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.821
Bp 111 over 77, heart rate 136.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.290
Dropped to 32,
and then shot back up.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.159
Cushing's response.
Brainstem herniation?

01:00.161 --> 01:02.612
Let's not go there yet.

01:02.613 --> 01:05.063
Transfer on my count.
Ready? One, two, three.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.665
Any sedation or paralytics
in the field?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.167
No.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.375
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.544
Not initiating a breath.
Resume bagging.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.552
No corneal reflex.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.287
What's with maggie?

01:28.289 --> 01:30.722
Officer windham
arrested maggie last year.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

02:09.130 --> 02:11.864
Lieutenant windham,
as I explained,

02:11.866 --> 02:14.366
your wife's ct showed
massive bleeding.

02:14.368 --> 02:18.170
The tests confirm
she's not responsive to stimuli,

02:18.172 --> 02:19.805
and her blood flow study
indicates

02:19.807 --> 02:21.807
that the pressure in her brain

02:21.809 --> 02:24.910
is greater
than her blood pressure.

02:24.912 --> 02:28.280
She has no blood flow
to her brain.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.282
Unfortunately,
all of these things tell us

02:30.284 --> 02:32.184
that your wife is brain dead.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.690
I'm very sorry.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.194
You're telling me she's dead?

02:45.466 --> 02:46.932
My wife's dead.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.634
We're right here for you,
darryl.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.903
She was just walking
to the mailbox.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.804
I don't understand.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.473
I don't get it. She was...

02:54.475 --> 02:56.608
She was walking to the mailbox.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.311
I know this must be
a terrible shock for you.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.190
Lieutenant,

03:11.192 --> 03:12.291
I did see on her records

03:12.293 --> 03:14.793
your wife is
a registered organ donor.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.367
Yeah.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.436
Kate was all about
helping others.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.289
Our charge nurse will
coordinate the donations.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.226
Lieutenant windham,
this is maggie lockwood.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.997
You're the nurse...
That's the nurse...

03:51.999 --> 03:55.567
That's, um...

03:55.569 --> 03:57.302
You're the nurse from last year.

03:58.539 --> 04:01.373
Okay. We'll give you
some time, lieutenant.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.009
Again, I'm very sorry.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.986
I am gonna be right back.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.423
Dr. Choi, can I talk to you
for a minute?

04:22.930 --> 04:25.564
Given the history between
your nurse and officer windham,

04:25.566 --> 04:26.999
we have a problem.

04:27.001 --> 04:28.467
It's hard enough
on the lieutenant.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.668
He doesn't need this.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.436
Maggie's a pro.
She'll do her job.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.739
Doctor, if you're
not gonna handle this,

04:33.741 --> 04:35.874
I'm gonna go over your head.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.879
I understand you're
taking care of your own,

04:40.881 --> 04:42.848
but I need to do the same.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.385
I'll talk with ms. Goodwin.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.725
Hey. So, why'd maggie
get arrested? What happened?

04:53.727 --> 04:55.961
The charge was interfering
with a police investigation.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.763
But maggie was
protecting a patient.

04:57.765 --> 05:01.433
In my opinion,
officer windham overreacted.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.068
Dr. Manning,

05:03.069 --> 05:04.702
you set for the morbidity
and mortality conference?

05:04.705 --> 05:06.305
- I am, doc...
- Good. See you there.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.973
M&m is non-punitive.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.941
It's a learning experience.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.311
- Okay.
- Dr. Halstead?

05:12.313 --> 05:14.646
- Yes?
- I expect to see you there too.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.082
As her attending physician,
you are ultimately responsible

05:17.084 --> 05:18.684
for dr. Manning's actions.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.419
Right.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.089
I am so sorry to put you
in this position.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.325
I'm not concerned.
You did everything right.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.959
Except my patient died.

05:27.961 --> 05:31.463
Natalie, hey, you're being
too hard on yourself.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.098
You know, sometimes things
just don't break

05:33.100 --> 05:34.366
the way we want them too.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.801
If you need backup,
I'm available.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.370
Thanks, um,
but I've got it covered.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.875
Med students don't present,
clarke. Doctors only.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.714
I knew it.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.483
Sawfly larva.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.119
I ate half of that apple

05:54.121 --> 05:56.655
before I saw it
crawling out of the core.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.423
That's nice.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.592
Nice?

06:00.594 --> 06:03.128
Sarah, what is the matter
with you?

06:03.130 --> 06:04.730
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.965
I didn't get any sleep
last night.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.600
This neurology rotation
I'm doing...

06:08.602 --> 06:10.669
Dr. Abrams had me pull
a second shift.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.704
Tell abrams that residents
aren't supposed

06:12.706 --> 06:14.005
to work more than
a 12-hour shift.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.841
Yeah, well, you tell him.

06:15.843 --> 06:16.842
I got to go.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.611
Here. I have something.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.750
- What is that?
- Espresso beans.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.017
Robusta from brazil.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.886
Highest concentration
of caffeine.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.022
Take five every hour.
Chew thoroughly.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.023
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.692
Thanks.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.460
Hey.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.604
Abnormal heart tones?

06:45.606 --> 06:47.606
No. Heart rate is 150.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.508
Strong and steady.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.110
- How do the measurements look?
- Give me a second.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.583
Crown-to-chin length measurement
is 30.9 millimeters.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.019
Well within the normal
parameters.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.721
So, the tb meds...

07:02.723 --> 07:05.123
don't seem to be causing
any problems.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.959
That's great news.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.795
You were right.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.665
I'll see you back downstairs.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.437
No. The heart recipient has
already been notified.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.605
I need a echo,
bronchoscopy, liver biopsy,

07:20.607 --> 07:22.841
standard chest x-ray,
and chest ct.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.142
Send the results to me,
and I'll forward it

07:24.144 --> 07:25.811
to the transplant team.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.447
Yep. Thank you.

07:28.449 --> 07:31.216
Maggie, I heard about
officer windham's accident.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.751
- Yeah.
- I think it's best

07:32.753 --> 07:35.086
that we let April be the liaison
on this one.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.988
No worries. I'm already
into it with the labs.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.658
Even so, I know what a hard
time you had with the arrest.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.461
Why stir up all those feelings?

07:42.463 --> 07:44.896
I don't need coddling.
I can do my job.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.966
Maggie, we need to consider
the patient's family as well.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.768
I think it's better
for all concerned

07:49.770 --> 07:50.869
that we get in front of this.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.671
It's too loaded.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.039
You're taking me off?

07:54.041 --> 07:56.141
Sharon, come on.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.876
Let April handle it.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.149
Mr. Koslow.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.784
I'm dr. Halstead.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.487
You were brought in unconscious.
What happened?

08:08.489 --> 08:11.156
I'm laying here
practically naked, doc.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.091
You could call me felix.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.194
Last thing I remember,
I was coming back from a run

08:16.196 --> 08:17.929
feeling a little lightheaded.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.164
Well, according
to the paramedics,

08:19.166 --> 08:20.765
you were passed out
in the bathroom.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.100
Yeah. But I'm fine.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.935
And I can't stay here.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.504
I'm a jockey.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.772
Just been busting my ass
getting ready

08:27.774 --> 08:29.608
for a race at santa anita
tomorrow,

08:29.610 --> 08:32.010
so must have just overdone it.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.648
- Ever happen before?
- Never.

08:36.650 --> 08:37.916
I really don't need to be here.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.049
Tell me if this hurts.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.720
Just kidding.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.923
When I was a kid,
my dad used to take me

08:44.925 --> 08:46.958
down to the racetracks
at hawthorne.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.560
The man never picked a winner.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.929
Most kids dream about playing
in the world series.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.899
For me, it's all about
the kentucky derby.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.901
Took years of riding
at bs tracks

08:55.903 --> 08:57.869
to get over to churchill downs.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.171
Been working my way up there,

09:00.173 --> 09:02.574
but, you know, in the winter
the track closes down,

09:02.576 --> 09:05.844
so I've been picking up mounts
on the west... west coast.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.145
Open wide for me.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.714
Very possible this is
just a bout of overtraining.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.684
You say you're feeling fine.
You sure?

09:12.686 --> 09:16.187
Little weak, but nothing
that's gonna stop me.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.822
I'm on a great horse tomorrow.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.758
Well, let's make sure
you're fit to mount up.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.327
I'm ordering an ekg and an echo
to check your heart.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.929
I'm still waiting
on those lab results,

09:23.931 --> 09:25.797
so for now, sit tight.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.201
Dr. Manning!

09:31.071 --> 09:32.170
Brett, talk to me.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.806
Car crash. 44-year-old female.
Gcs 14.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.641
Large laceration to the head.
Pale and sweaty.

09:36.643 --> 09:37.676
Lvad keeps alarming.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.777
Page dr. Rhodes and let him know

09:38.779 --> 09:40.045
we got an lvad down here.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.646
- Bria, honey?
- Copy. You're going

09:41.648 --> 09:43.582
to trauma 1, dr. Manning.
Got it.

09:43.584 --> 09:46.685
- Report.
- 17-year-old female. Gcs 15.

09:46.687 --> 09:50.021
No loc. Vitals are stable.
Hands and feet moving.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.022
Complaining of neck pain.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.024
- Bria!
- Mom?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.726
Dr. Choi,
you're going to trauma 2.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.929
- Copy.
- Bria! Baby!

09:57.931 --> 09:59.197
- Mom!
- Here we go.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.099
One, two, three.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.867
Okay, let's transfer
on my count.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.970
Ready? One, two, three.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.174
- Where's my mom?
- Easy, easy.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.308
Eyes on me. Eyes on me.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.643
She is right next door.

10:11.644 --> 10:12.977
You're gonna see her
real soon, okay?

10:12.980 --> 10:14.613
She has a bad heart.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.247
They called. We were coming in
for a transplant.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.983
Okay. Heart surgeon's
on his way down.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.385
Can you tell us what hurts?

10:20.386 --> 10:22.786
My neck. It snapped back
after the airbag hit me.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.023
I got a call
saying a heart's available,

10:25.025 --> 10:26.224
said to get here.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.861
Guy ran a red light.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.096
Where's my daughter?

10:31.098 --> 10:32.297
She is in good hands.
Right now we need

10:32.299 --> 10:33.898
to worry about you, okay?

10:33.900 --> 10:35.517
Let's get her hooked up
to the monitor

10:35.518 --> 10:37.135
and rapidly transfuse
two packed red blood cells

10:37.137 --> 10:38.553
and two plasma.

10:38.554 --> 10:39.970
Then get x-rays of her chest
and pelvis, okay?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.172
Okay.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.173
All right, I'm gonna take this

10:42.175 --> 10:43.975
off now, okay?

10:43.976 --> 10:45.776
I tried to swerve,
but I was going too fast.

10:45.779 --> 10:46.978
It really hurts!

10:46.980 --> 10:48.897
We're gonna give you
something for the pain.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.815
Then we need to make sure you
don't have any fractures, okay?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.651
Let's get a ct of her neck
and thoracic spine

10:52.653 --> 10:54.786
and 0.2 milligrams
of hydromorphone.

10:56.506 --> 10:58.223
All right, let's give her
50 mics fentanyl iv push.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.059
No. No.
I'm a recovering alcoholic.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.427
- Meghan?
- Dr. Rhodes.

11:02.429 --> 11:05.397
I made it. I'm...
I'm ready for the transplant.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.298
Okay, you just try
to stay calm, okay?

11:07.300 --> 11:08.366
We're gonna figure this out.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.768
She's having suction events.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.970
She's still hypovolemic,
let's up her volume.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.304
I need to close up
this head wound.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.739
Can you check her lvad?

11:14.741 --> 11:16.741
- Yeah. You got it.
- Skin stapler?

11:16.743 --> 11:19.210
Right away. Here you go.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.013
Where... aah!

11:22.015 --> 11:23.748
Where's bria?

11:23.750 --> 11:25.016
Where's my baby?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.151
We're gonna take care of her,
all right?

11:26.153 --> 11:27.185
Let's get some pressure on this.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.286
Yes, doctor.

11:28.288 --> 11:31.790
I'm... I'm okay.
I got a hard head.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.925
Just relax.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.329
- What happened?
- Auto accident.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.464
How bad is it?

11:39.466 --> 11:40.899
We've got a donor heart
in baghdad.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.467
She needs to be able
to tolerate the surgery.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.469
I'm hoping the head wound is
just superficial.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.271
We won't know anything
until she gets a ct.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.656
We're headed up there now.

11:47.657 --> 11:49.040
All right, well,
keep your fingers crossed.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.408
She's got better odds
of hitting the lottery

11:50.410 --> 11:52.043
than she does of matching
to another heart

11:52.045 --> 11:53.778
- before it's too late.
- Yeah.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.224
Lieutenant windham?

12:08.795 --> 12:10.228
- Yeah.
- Hi. I'm April.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.864
I'm very sorry for your loss.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.066
I'll be handling
your wife's care.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.168
I thought it was the...

12:17.170 --> 12:18.770
Thought it was the other nurse.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.873
I'm coordinating
with the transplant teams today.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.441
Your wife's organs are
in the process

12:23.443 --> 12:25.110
of being matched
to people in need.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.412
Once that's complete, we'll
go ahead and schedule surgery.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.481
You're free to stay with her
throughout the process.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.257
And tell me...
How many people will she save?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.860
That depends on
the organ evaluation results,

12:41.862 --> 12:45.396
but she could potentially save
seven, eight lives.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.499
We've already found a match
for her heart.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.304
That's kate.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.407
Always going above and beyond.

12:58.145 --> 13:01.146
I'm here for you
every step of the way.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.814
Please don't hesitate
to reach out

13:02.816 --> 13:05.250
should you have any questions
or need anything.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.419
Thank you.

13:09.523 --> 13:11.856
Thank you.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.560
Hey. When you call the lab,
make sure you deal with sue.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.428
She gets the blood and tissue
samples analyzed faster

13:17.430 --> 13:18.863
- than anybody else.
- All right.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.198
And once they match
the other organs,

13:20.200 --> 13:22.867
make sure that you...
maggie, I know how to do this.

13:22.869 --> 13:25.170
I'm sorry if you feel
like I'm stepping on your toes.

13:25.172 --> 13:29.040
You're not stepping
on my toes. It's just...

13:29.042 --> 13:30.942
It's my responsibility.

13:38.385 --> 13:41.553
Meghan,
we got your test results.

13:41.555 --> 13:44.022
Your ct scan looks fine.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.191
Then I'm okay
to have the surgery, right?

13:46.193 --> 13:49.093
Unfortunately,
there's another problem.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.930
We do a tox screen
as part of your pre-op workup.

13:51.932 --> 13:55.133
Your blood alcohol content
came back 0.06.

13:55.135 --> 13:58.136
No. It can't...
That's a mistake.

13:58.138 --> 14:01.005
I... I told her not to,
but that doctor must have

14:01.007 --> 14:02.540
given me pain medication.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.409
Pain medication
would have no effect

14:04.411 --> 14:05.610
on the blood alcohol levels.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.946
Check it again!

14:12.552 --> 14:15.053
I'm sorry.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.422
I screwed up.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.291
Can you explain your actions?

14:20.293 --> 14:23.228
Margaret brazetti.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.563
She's my age. Three kids.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.565
Been on the transplant list
two years.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.901
Met in a support group.

14:29.903 --> 14:32.637
Was always positive.
Always laughing.

14:32.639 --> 14:36.040
And she got me through
some really hard days.

14:36.042 --> 14:40.144
She died this morning.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.180
I slipped.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.882
Two shots.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.417
First time in three years.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.921
Then I got the call
about the heart.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.890
I asked bria to take me.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.928
If I hadn't asked her,
she wouldn't be hurt.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.898
The asking wasn't the problem.
The drinking was.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.437
Does this mean
I don't get the heart?

15:10.443 --> 15:12.577
That's the committee's decision.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.015
You should try
and get some rest.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.017
Rest?

15:19.019 --> 15:23.254
Is bria, um, back from her ct?

15:23.256 --> 15:25.023
We'll have somebody check.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.664
As I recall,
you vouched for her.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.166
I did.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.168
Quite an unfortunate choice.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.309
All the other matches are in?

15:44.311 --> 15:46.044
Yeah. Got teams flying in
from wisconsin,

15:46.046 --> 15:48.012
st. Louis, and des moines.

15:48.014 --> 15:51.449
April, is it possible
for some of us to be

15:51.451 --> 15:53.418
in the or with darryl
during the procedure?

15:53.420 --> 15:55.053
He could use the support.

15:55.054 --> 15:56.687
I will have to talk
to the surgical charge nurse,

15:56.690 --> 15:58.323
but I'm sure
we can work something out.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.425
Thanks.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.393
Excuse me.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.662
Excuse me. Um...

16:04.664 --> 16:06.664
I was the one
who asked for someone else

16:06.666 --> 16:08.032
to take charge of this.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.301
It really wasn't personal.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.703
I was just thinking
of the lieutenant.

16:11.705 --> 16:14.038
You understand?

16:19.179 --> 16:21.713
No. Everything's good.

16:21.715 --> 16:24.282
Flying out at 9:00.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.418
Yeah. I'll see you first thing
for the morning workout.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.120
Yeah.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.189
Got your labs back
and the results of your echo.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.224
Yeah. I'm sure
nothing's wrong with me

16:33.226 --> 16:36.427
that these bags of fluid
haven't fixed.

16:36.429 --> 16:40.031
Well, you're dehydrated.
It will help with that.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.503
Felix, your creatinine
and sodium are high

16:45.505 --> 16:47.171
and your potassium is low,

16:47.173 --> 16:50.541
and I noticed enamel erosion
around some of your teeth.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.411
Now, all these are indicators
of bulimia.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.680
Bulimia is... is
something girls get.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.416
Well, actually, 1/3 of those
suffering from bulimia are men.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.052
Eating disorders are not
specific to women,

17:01.054 --> 17:02.553
and you should know
they're treatable.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.255
I don't have an eating disorder.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.290
I've got a job that requires me
to make weight,

17:06.291 --> 17:08.026
or I don't get to ride.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.594
All jockeys flip.

17:09.596 --> 17:10.929
Flip?

17:10.930 --> 17:12.262
Yeah. Stick our fingers
down our throat.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.464
If that ain't enough,
some guys sit in the hot box

17:14.467 --> 17:15.500
and sweat it out.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.135
Some down laxatives.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.237
I take diuretics.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.071
Because of the purging
and diuretics,

17:21.074 --> 17:22.573
you're considerably underweight,

17:22.575 --> 17:25.510
which has caused
a mitral valve prolapse,

17:25.512 --> 17:29.313
meaning the valve in your heart
has become floppy.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.815
And it's treatable.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.418
I'd like to put a tube through
your nose into your stomach

17:33.420 --> 17:35.053
to feed you calories.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.622
Now, over time,
this may reverse the mvp

17:37.624 --> 17:39.341
and fatten up your heart.

17:39.342 --> 17:41.182
What happens if I don't?
Is it gonna kill me?

17:42.295 --> 17:44.328
With your lifestyle,
you are putting yourself

17:44.330 --> 17:46.764
at a much greater risk of
infection, cardiac arrhythmia,

17:46.766 --> 17:48.199
or even heart failure.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.801
I've been riding
executive chef for a year.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.469
That's four wins and a place.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.372
I am one ride away
from that derby mount.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.740
- Felix...
- No... I'm finishing this fluid,

17:55.742 --> 17:57.642
and I'm getting the hell
out of here.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.180
We have a pre-op consult
upstairs in six minutes.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.549
Dr. Reece, dr. Abrams.
How's it going?

18:04.551 --> 18:06.484
I need to break her
of all your bad habits.

18:06.486 --> 18:09.687
I've found my most successful
residents happily volunteer

18:09.689 --> 18:11.856
to work well past
the standard 80-hour week.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.761
Dr. Charles.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.464
Meghan scott, my transplant
patient you evaluated.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.099
Yeah.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.733
Turns out that
you were right about her.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.669
She fell off the wagon.

18:26.106 --> 18:29.207
Really?

18:29.209 --> 18:32.477
I'm very sorry to hear that.

18:32.479 --> 18:35.379
The way I put you on the spot
about your decision...

18:35.381 --> 18:36.514
I owe you an apology.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.815
No, you don't.

18:37.817 --> 18:41.252
I appreciate the gesture,
but my evaluation...

18:41.254 --> 18:44.288
I vetted her. It was my call.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.391
I should, um... I should
probably check in with her.

18:47.393 --> 18:52.730
The transplant committee's gonna
want another assessment.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.732
If you'll excuse me,
I've got to get to the m&m.

18:54.734 --> 18:55.867
Yes. Thank you for telling me.

18:55.869 --> 18:58.202
Of course.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.149
The patient became unstable

19:11.151 --> 19:13.751
due to an unrecognized
pericardial effusion,

19:13.753 --> 19:18.222
which was stabilized
by emergent pericardiocentesis.

19:18.224 --> 19:20.625
You presented the images
of the mrcp

19:20.627 --> 19:22.460
demonstrating cholelithiasis

19:22.462 --> 19:25.863
to support your diagnosis
of pancreatitis

19:25.865 --> 19:27.665
due to choledocholithiasis,

19:27.667 --> 19:29.267
but you aren't showing us
any images

19:29.269 --> 19:31.936
of the lung bases or heart.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.338
Those images were not obtained.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.840
Why not?

19:35.842 --> 19:38.809
The patient's movement
resulted in unreadable images.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.379
Why didn't you repeat the scan?

19:41.381 --> 19:43.347
The study captured
adequate detail

19:43.349 --> 19:44.682
within the area of interest.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.518
So, had you been more vigilant
at this juncture,

19:47.520 --> 19:49.220
perhaps you would have
identified

19:49.222 --> 19:51.222
this patient's
pericardial effusion

19:51.224 --> 19:54.926
and avoided his subsequent
cardiovascular collapse.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.229
In hindsight, yes.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.698
At the time, I believed
I had what I needed.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.901
Let's move on.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.370
You mentioned placing
the patient on bipap,

20:06.372 --> 20:08.839
which exacerbated
cardiac tamponade.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.708
How did you respond?

20:11.978 --> 20:14.579
How are you feeling?

20:14.581 --> 20:16.781
Like I screwed up two lives.

20:19.953 --> 20:21.986
Let's get you two together.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.721
I'll have this dividing wall
opened up.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.357
How is she? Is her neck okay?

20:26.359 --> 20:28.593
Good news is
there are no fractures.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.728
Okay. What's the bad?

20:30.730 --> 20:33.631
It's not necessarily bad.
It might be minor,

20:33.633 --> 20:36.567
but bria's ct showed a mass
in her upper thoracic spine,

20:36.569 --> 20:38.636
unrelated to the accident.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.539
God. A mass means tumor, right?

20:41.541 --> 20:43.507
It could be a number of things.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.345
My poor baby.

20:49.315 --> 20:51.716
She's had some back pain
in the last few months.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.985
She tried to convince me
it was nothing.

20:53.987 --> 20:56.988
I should've brought her in.
This is my fault.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.890
Meghan, until we do an mri

20:59.892 --> 21:01.759
to get a better look
at what we're dealing with,

21:01.761 --> 21:04.562
the best thing you could do
is try to stay calm.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.913
Son of a bitch!

21:22.915 --> 21:24.815
I need this damn thing out!

21:24.817 --> 21:26.284
Mr. Koslow, please,
you need to calm down.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.485
And you need to take this
out of my arm.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.887
I'm two pounds over.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.288
Hey, hey, hey.
It's just water weight.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.622
That iv is the only reason
you're feeling stronger.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.723
You need to leave it in.

21:32.724 --> 21:33.823
You know, screw this.
You're not gonna do it,

21:33.826 --> 21:34.925
- I'll pull it out myself.
- Whoa!

21:34.927 --> 21:35.993
No, no, no.
Please don't do that.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.028
Okay. Fine.
That's what you want,

21:37.030 --> 21:38.496
let's get you back to your room.

21:38.497 --> 21:39.963
Hell, no! You're gonna try
to give me something.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.499
I'm done with this crap!
No! Mister-

21:41.501 --> 21:42.967
- Get off of...
- Hey.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.303
- Now you're bleeding.
- I'm fine.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.309
Okay. This is
why you need to be treated.

21:51.311 --> 21:54.045
I did that,
and now I'm too fat to ride.

21:54.047 --> 21:57.014
You can not take
diuretics again.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.716
You are playing
russian roulette.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.518
There are only so many times
you can pull that trigger.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.386
Let me go, now!

22:16.085 --> 22:16.834
Mom, I'm fine!

22:16.836 --> 22:18.402
It's just a blanket.

22:18.404 --> 22:19.670
I don't need it.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.871
Everything okay?

22:20.873 --> 22:22.506
She just seemed cold.

22:22.508 --> 22:23.641
And you shouldn't be up.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.409
Can I help you back into bed?

22:25.411 --> 22:26.844
Dr. Reese?

22:26.846 --> 22:29.680
I'm doing a rotation
in neurocritical care.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.584
The mass we found
is not a tumor.

22:33.586 --> 22:34.919
Thank god.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.821
It's a spinal avm,

22:36.823 --> 22:38.856
which is an abnormal tangle
of blood vessels.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.658
Is it serious?

22:40.660 --> 22:42.493
Bria's probably had it
since she was born.

22:42.495 --> 22:43.561
Quite often, we don't find it

22:43.563 --> 22:44.895
until it starts
causing problems.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.664
What kind of problems?

22:46.666 --> 22:49.567
Down the line, numbness,
hemorrhage,

22:49.569 --> 22:50.768
even paralysis.

22:50.770 --> 22:53.604
So, the back pain was a sign.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.539
We could've caught this
months ago.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.975
Let's focus on the fact
that we caught it now.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.478
It can be treated surgically.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.414
Dr. Reese will do
a neurosurgery consult with you,

23:03.416 --> 23:05.082
and then our head
of neurosurgery, dr. Abrams,

23:05.084 --> 23:07.051
will come down
and go over the details.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.553
I'm so sorry, bria.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.689
Stop it. It's not your fault.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.824
No. I wasn't thinking about you.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.860
I was only thinking
about myself.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.928
Having an avm is unfortunate,

23:17.930 --> 23:21.599
but finding it now,
as early as we have,

23:21.601 --> 23:23.100
is the best we could ask for.

23:33.112 --> 23:36.447
Dr. Manning then paged me
to perform a pericardiocentesis.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.816
Did you recommend
sending the fluid for analysis

23:38.818 --> 23:42.420
and obtaining a ct chest,
abdomen, and pelvis?

23:42.422 --> 23:43.954
I did.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.692
The ct showed a large mass
in the right middle lobe

23:48.694 --> 23:51.695
with bulky hilar
and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

23:51.697 --> 23:54.498
And that's when dr. Manning
called for an oncology consult?

23:54.500 --> 23:57.735
Yes. And their recommendation
was chemotherapy.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.104
- Dr. Rhodes?
- I recommended an alternative.

24:00.106 --> 24:03.674
Since
the primary mass was resectable,

24:03.676 --> 24:05.443
I thought it best
to move forward with surgery

24:05.445 --> 24:07.845
without delay.
And dr. Manning disagreed?

24:07.847 --> 24:09.747
I thought the radiation would
give the pancreatitis

24:09.749 --> 24:10.981
time to cool down.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.150
- What was his ranson's score?
- It was...

24:13.152 --> 24:15.619
what difference does that make?

24:15.621 --> 24:18.155
There's no reliable way
to predict tumor lysis syndrome.

24:19.225 --> 24:22.693
Dr. Manning, if your
white knight plans on continuing

24:22.695 --> 24:25.463
his medical education
at this hospital,

24:25.465 --> 24:26.897
I recommend that you advise him

24:26.899 --> 24:29.834
to remove himself
from my presence.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.837
Let's take a five-minute break.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.486
How dare you?

24:48.488 --> 24:49.987
I know. I shouldn't have said...

24:49.989 --> 24:51.956
I am not a damsel in distress,

24:51.958 --> 24:54.492
and I do not need you
to defend me.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.659
I was only trying to help.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.928
You humiliated me in there.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.097
Natalie, I'm sorry.

25:06.506 --> 25:07.705
If he gets on that horse,

25:07.707 --> 25:09.073
he's not only a danger
to himself,

25:09.075 --> 25:10.841
but every other jockey
in the race.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.910
I don't disagree.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.245
Can we keep him on a psych hold?

25:14.247 --> 25:16.580
No, we can't. I mean,
from everything you told me,

25:16.582 --> 25:18.949
his stated intention is
to win the race.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.985
He didn't say anything
about doing intentional harm.

25:20.987 --> 25:23.988
And if we do hold him,
he'd probably sue the hospital,

25:23.990 --> 25:25.289
and you personally.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.091
If you can't convince him
to stay,

25:27.093 --> 25:29.860
get him to sign that he's
leaving against medical advice.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.830
He's already asked
for the paperwork.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.965
Then it's settled.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.769
Damn it!

25:40.273 --> 25:42.973
That ultrasound was
a huge relief.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.642
Yeah.

25:44.644 --> 25:48.078
So, now that we know
everything's okay,

25:48.080 --> 25:50.814
there's something I'm hoping
you'll consider

25:50.816 --> 25:53.150
for the baby's sake.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.719
Maybe it would be good if you
stopped working for a while,

25:55.721 --> 25:57.254
just until the kid is born.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.956
I know how you feel
about your job.

25:58.958 --> 26:01.926
I'm not asking you
to give that up.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.828
But a few months could help
to take away some stress.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.964
If it was up to you,
there wouldn't even be a baby.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.767
April, I told you I'm sorry.

26:09.769 --> 26:12.336
The only reason I wanted
to consider terminating was

26:12.338 --> 26:14.905
I thought the baby would have
no quality of life.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.275
I didn't want to put you...
Us through that.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.079
My job's not endangering
the pregnancy.

26:22.081 --> 26:25.716
The second I feel like work is
negatively affecting me,

26:25.718 --> 26:27.651
I'll stop.

26:27.653 --> 26:30.254
For now, I'm fine.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.222
We are fine.

26:34.226 --> 26:37.928
So, dr. Charles,
you assessed meghan scott today.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.263
- Yes, I did...
- I don't understand

26:39.265 --> 26:41.465
why we're debating this.

26:41.466 --> 26:43.666
An alcoholic must be sober for
18 months before being eligible

26:43.669 --> 26:45.135
for transplant...
Those are the rules.

26:45.137 --> 26:46.804
This patient disqualified
herself.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.173
Dr. Latham,
right now in the hospital,

26:49.175 --> 26:51.275
we have an excellent match
for a heart,

26:51.277 --> 26:56.347
an organ which you know has
a limited window of viability.

26:56.349 --> 26:58.782
We may have to think
beyond the rules.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.619
What stops her from drinking
the next time she gets upset?

27:01.621 --> 27:04.788
Ironically, relapse can be a
very important part of recovery.

27:04.790 --> 27:07.224
Happens to most addicts
at some point,

27:07.226 --> 27:10.027
and it's very often
the utter misery

27:10.029 --> 27:11.395
of falling off the wagon

27:11.397 --> 27:12.830
that motivates those that suffer

27:12.832 --> 27:14.965
to finally get serious
about staying sober.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.067
And you believe this is
the case for ms. Scott?

27:17.069 --> 27:20.004
I also think it's been a very
real wake-up call for her.

27:20.006 --> 27:23.340
Until the accident, bria was
performing the caretaker role,

27:23.342 --> 27:26.143
but now meghan realizes
the importance

27:26.145 --> 27:29.113
of stepping up
and taking responsibility

27:29.115 --> 27:31.949
not just for herself,
but also for her daughter.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.284
So, bottom line, are you saying

27:34.286 --> 27:35.853
the committee should
give ms. Scott

27:35.855 --> 27:37.788
the currently available heart?

27:42.328 --> 27:47.931
As a human being,
I would love to root for meghan.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.834
As a doctor, I'm...
I'm just more aware than ever

27:50.836 --> 27:53.837
of the power that this disease
can have over somebody.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.408
Dr. Rhodes?

27:58.911 --> 28:01.879
I was confident

28:01.881 --> 28:04.882
when I pushed for meghan
to be put on the list.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.687
Regretfully,
I am less confident now.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.992
If there are no more questions,

28:14.994 --> 28:16.427
I move the committee
take a vote.

28:16.429 --> 28:17.695
All those in favor

28:17.697 --> 28:19.897
of meghan scott
receiving the heart,

28:19.899 --> 28:21.865
signify with a "yea."

28:21.867 --> 28:24.868
yea.

28:24.870 --> 28:28.272
All those against,
signify with a "nay."

28:28.274 --> 28:31.942
- nay.
- Nay.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.078
The nays have it.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.213
We'll look for
another recipient.

28:55.122 --> 28:56.477
You remain conflicted
about meghan scott

28:56.478 --> 28:57.833
despite her breaking
the clearly defined rules

28:57.837 --> 29:00.370
for being
a transplant candidate.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.072
Yes.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.475
I... I remain conflicted.

29:04.477 --> 29:06.510
I've worked
with a lot of alcoholics,

29:06.512 --> 29:09.513
and I know real regret
when I see it.

29:09.515 --> 29:12.316
Real regret?

29:12.318 --> 29:13.517
Can you elaborate?

29:13.519 --> 29:16.220
What exactly did you see
in ms. Scott?

29:16.222 --> 29:19.356
Well, I... I saw real sadness.

29:19.358 --> 29:22.860
You know, there were tears
rolling down her face,

29:22.862 --> 29:25.496
and, um, her jaw was clenched,
you know,

29:25.498 --> 29:30.234
and her body sort of drooped
with what looked like shame.

29:40.813 --> 29:42.946
That's interesting.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.452
Are you sure
you're gonna be all right?

29:48.454 --> 29:50.954
Sweetie, you need to stop
worrying about me.

29:50.956 --> 29:54.324
All I want you to think about is
how much I love you.

29:55.828 --> 29:59.129
And when you wake up,
I'll be right there, okay?

30:00.933 --> 30:02.533
I love you, baby. Love you, too.

30:06.839 --> 30:09.973
Please let her be all right.

30:14.380 --> 30:17.981
While debatable choices were
made by all involved,

30:17.983 --> 30:21.185
no one physician is to blame.

30:21.187 --> 30:24.221
My recommendation is
to revisit hospital policy

30:24.223 --> 30:26.456
on requiring doctors
to be present

30:26.458 --> 30:28.325
when radiation is administered.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.295
Only with more skilled eyes
on the ecg

30:31.297 --> 30:33.230
can future incidents of tls

30:33.232 --> 30:35.399
be identified and treated.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.168
Hope you've all learned
something here today

30:38.170 --> 30:41.071
that will make you
better physicians.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.240
On a personal note,

30:43.242 --> 30:47.511
it's ill-advised for residents
to date medical students.

30:58.991 --> 31:02.226
Is there something
that I can help you with?

31:02.228 --> 31:04.061
Yeah. I was looking for April.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.362
She's on a break right now.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.965
But I can answer any question
you might have.

31:09.869 --> 31:12.870
Yeah. My wife, kate,
has this necklace,

31:12.872 --> 31:15.606
and, I think it was a gift
from her mother.

31:15.608 --> 31:18.242
And, you know, anyways,

31:18.244 --> 31:21.478
she always wears it,

31:21.480 --> 31:26.116
but the clasp broke,
in the accident.

31:26.118 --> 31:28.385
And I know she'd want
to have it with her. I just...

31:28.387 --> 31:31.388
I understand. It can be
in her hand through the surgery.

31:33.025 --> 31:34.892
I can make sure April gets it.

31:58.384 --> 31:59.650
We can put them back together,

31:59.652 --> 32:01.485
but we can't change
their behavior, right?

32:01.487 --> 32:06.189
"I am indeed a king because
I know how to rule myself."

32:06.191 --> 32:07.524
pietro aretino.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.393
He was a 16th century poet.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.661
What are you getting at, doc?

32:10.663 --> 32:12.329
Well, put it this way:
In this case,

32:12.331 --> 32:14.665
the king might be in
for a rude awakening

32:14.667 --> 32:16.366
when they drug test him
before the race.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.669
Yeah, if he gets tested.
Testing's random.

32:18.671 --> 32:20.304
I don't know.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.572
I mean, somebody could make
an anonymous phone call,

32:22.574 --> 32:24.174
you know, tipping off the track

32:24.176 --> 32:27.577
that he took a diuretic.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.313
You never know.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.581
Somebody maybe already did.

32:31.583 --> 32:34.685
Dr. Charles. Those signs
that you talked about earlier...

32:34.687 --> 32:37.521
The sadness in the eyes,
the clenched jaw...

32:37.523 --> 32:39.189
I don't see them.

32:39.191 --> 32:41.258
I'd like to know
why they elude me.

32:42.695 --> 32:44.728
You know, I might have
some literature in my office

32:44.730 --> 32:47.431
that could illuminate
some of this stuff for you.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.099
You got a couple minutes?

33:05.417 --> 33:07.184
How's bria?

33:07.186 --> 33:09.686
Dr. Abrams just started
cauterizing the avm.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.991
He's a really good surgeon.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.692
I just wish he wasn't
such a dick.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.464
Keep me posted.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.209
- Rough day?
- Yeah.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.077
Grab a bite?

33:37.549 --> 33:38.648
I'd like that.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.151
Dr. Rhodes, daniel.

33:41.153 --> 33:45.322
We found another recipient
for officer windham's heart,

33:45.324 --> 33:47.557
but the woman lives
in san diego,

33:47.559 --> 33:50.293
and that's
at least a four-hour flight.

33:50.295 --> 33:51.695
If there were a delay,

33:51.697 --> 33:54.164
we couldn't guarantee
the heart's viability,

33:54.166 --> 33:56.767
and we cannot postpone
harvesting

33:56.769 --> 34:00.504
due to the needs of the
recipients of her other organs.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.506
So, therefore?

34:02.508 --> 34:06.276
Meghan scott will be receiving
officer windham's heart.

34:06.278 --> 34:11.047
Due to the circumstances,
it's the only option we have.

34:14.453 --> 34:15.485
I guess dinner will
have to wait.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.621
Yeah.

34:25.819 --> 34:27.074
- Sharon?
- Yeah?

34:27.074 --> 34:28.330
- Can we talk?
- Of course.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.833
That's the form.
Here, take this.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.703
What's up?

34:35.574 --> 34:39.476
Sharon, I want to take over
kate windham's care.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.360
Come on, maggie.

34:41.362 --> 34:43.245
We've been through this.
You know my concerns.

34:43.248 --> 34:46.616
Yes, and I respect them.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.784
But it's closure for me,

34:48.786 --> 34:50.487
and in a way
for kate windham, too.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.422
And what about her husband?

34:52.424 --> 34:53.757
What about his feelings?

34:53.759 --> 34:56.760
I promise you, I'll make sure
he feels comfortable.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.431
I need to do this.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.601
All right.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.536
All right. I'll talk to April.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.105
Okay.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.178
Can I speak to you,
lieutenant windham?

35:17.316 --> 35:19.449
You good? Okay.

35:22.821 --> 35:27.324
When I became a nurse,
I took an oath.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.559
I swore to devote myself
to the welfare

35:29.561 --> 35:31.228
of those committed to my care.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.196
That's my job.

35:33.198 --> 35:36.233
When your wife arrested me,
she was doing her job.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.836
I bear her no ill will.

35:43.408 --> 35:46.743
I'm very sorry for your loss.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.546
But I want to honor your wife,

35:49.548 --> 35:51.681
if you'll allow me.

35:55.921 --> 35:58.321
Yeah.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.601
No. No!

36:11.603 --> 36:13.537
Ms. Scott,
we need to get you upstairs.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.405
No... I don't care.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.741
I'm not going anywhere
until I find out about bria.

36:17.743 --> 36:20.744
She's still in surgery,
but doing well.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.680
Right now, the best thing you
could do for your daughter is

36:23.682 --> 36:25.815
to take care of yourself.

36:54.613 --> 36:55.879
We'll be right back with someone

36:55.881 --> 36:58.248
to take her up to the or.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.669
Hey.

37:20.606 --> 37:23.773
You know today wasn't
a defeat, right?

37:23.775 --> 37:25.642
I guess.

37:27.679 --> 37:32.749
The whole experience has been
a lesson in humility.

37:34.253 --> 37:37.954
Humility.
Always been a tough one for me.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.659
Good night.

37:42.661 --> 37:46.930
You know, clarke...
He was out of line today.

37:49.401 --> 37:51.534
But he was really
in your corner.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.538
Yeah.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.751
Hey, jeff!
You want to get a drink?

38:10.922 --> 38:12.689
I'll meet you over there.

38:18.330 --> 38:22.666
A nice move, daniel.
Anonymous phone call.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.934
We do what we can, sister.

38:24.936 --> 38:27.404
Yes, we do.

38:27.406 --> 38:30.440
So, the m&m.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.042
Stohl called you
my white knight.

38:32.044 --> 38:34.577
I know, nat,
and I feel terrible.

38:34.579 --> 38:37.914
And I... and I heard
what he said about dating.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.717
No, jeff. I can handle that.

38:42.054 --> 38:44.054
I'm just really sorry.

38:44.056 --> 38:46.056
It should be me
apologizing to you.

38:46.058 --> 38:48.992
Why? I'm the one
who made everything worse.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.960
I haven't been fair to you.

38:54.433 --> 38:58.468
Stohl also said that he hoped
we all learned something today.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.337
And I did.

39:04.609 --> 39:06.776
When jeff died,

39:06.778 --> 39:09.546
it created this void,

39:09.548 --> 39:12.082
this hole in my life,

39:12.084 --> 39:14.017
and in my heart.

39:16.088 --> 39:19.556
I needed someone
to fill that void...

39:20.592 --> 39:22.459
To take the pain away.

39:24.663 --> 39:27.731
And there you were.

39:27.733 --> 39:30.800
I feel like I used you.

39:30.802 --> 39:35.071
You gave me the illusion that
my life was fixed and whole.

39:36.775 --> 39:38.408
But it doesn't work that way.

39:38.410 --> 39:40.543
It can, though, natalie.
It can work that way.

39:40.545 --> 39:41.578
And look, I want to be...

39:41.580 --> 39:45.849
jeff, I think you're
a great guy.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.817
You're just not
the great guy for me.

39:51.390 --> 39:53.523
This is it?

39:55.694 --> 39:57.427
Yeah.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.635
