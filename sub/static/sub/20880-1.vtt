00:39.140 --> 00:41.107
Do you use Ketamine?

00:41.109 --> 00:42.742
No, Pentobarbital.

00:42.744 --> 00:44.544
The first injection
will induce sleep.

00:44.546 --> 00:49.082
So any pain sunny-girl is
experiencing will stop.

00:49.084 --> 00:52.452
The second injection will
slowly shut down her functions.

00:52.454 --> 00:54.054
Then she can have a
blessed eternal rest.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.430
Are you a professional or
a psychic pet whisperer?

01:17.111 --> 01:20.280
There's not much that can be
done because of her age, Mel.

01:20.282 --> 01:22.582
Her stomach's flipped.

01:22.584 --> 01:24.250
The surgery would
be too stressful.

01:24.252 --> 01:27.454
She just... she wouldn't survive.

01:27.456 --> 01:29.222
Oh, Jack.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.503
Goodbye, proud girl.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.560
I appreciate you getting
sunny-girl and me.

02:11.866 --> 02:13.299
I know this is
killing you inside.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.204
Take the time.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.206
Let it play out.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.811
Do you want that box of
notebooks still in the hallway?

02:35.523 --> 02:37.223
I'll get it when
I pick up the rest

02:37.225 --> 02:38.458
of the stuff from the garage.

02:38.460 --> 02:41.394
Which will be?

02:41.396 --> 02:42.896
I've got a review tomorrow.

02:42.898 --> 02:44.731
The Alfa needs a battery.

02:44.733 --> 02:46.799
And I'm sleeping on a couch
in my mother's studio.

02:46.801 --> 02:50.270
That's why I haven't collected
the rest of my things.

02:50.272 --> 02:52.512
I see your follow-through
outside the lab hasn't changed.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.944
I'll speak with you later.

02:57.946 --> 03:00.747
Jack.

03:00.749 --> 03:03.783
Don't shove it aside, okay?

03:03.785 --> 03:05.685
It'll come back and kick
you in the ass later.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.330
Morning, Medina.

03:50.332 --> 03:51.397
Cheers! ram.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.435
Sunny-girl?

03:57.871 --> 03:58.871
She went last evening.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.309
Arey.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.877
I thought she would
have a couple months.

04:04.879 --> 04:05.678
I know.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.480
It's so sad.

04:07.482 --> 04:08.548
Is Dr. Sutree okay?

04:09.751 --> 04:11.818
When you think of
smell detection,

04:11.820 --> 04:14.287
it's the nose interacting
with the brain.

04:14.289 --> 04:15.722
Olfaction.

04:15.724 --> 04:18.324
We are the only
research group seriously

04:18.326 --> 04:23.896
looking into the molecular basis
of olfaction involving sight.

04:23.898 --> 04:26.966
Does this liquid emit an odor?

04:28.131 --> 04:29.270
How would you know?

04:29.271 --> 04:32.305
Its molecules have to be
wafting through the air,

04:32.307 --> 04:34.307
and our noses have
to be fairly close.

04:34.309 --> 04:36.643
But if you could see
odors, think of how helpful

04:36.645 --> 04:36.643
that would be.

04:36.645 --> 04:39.012
You'd know something
about the contents

04:39.014 --> 04:40.947
without the
unpleasant experience.

04:40.949 --> 04:43.516
A major gas leak could be
detected from miles away.

04:43.518 --> 04:44.851
I probably even know
which one of you,

04:44.853 --> 04:47.387
had coffee brewed from
Robusta Beans this morning.

04:47.389 --> 04:51.624
This is quite a departure
from the original study, Jack.

04:51.626 --> 04:54.594
I mean, insects
carry a large number

04:54.596 --> 04:55.928
of debilitating diseases.

04:55.930 --> 04:57.630
Stopping that spread
has always been,

04:57.632 --> 05:02.068
about using traditional methods
to identify what attracts them.

05:02.070 --> 05:03.536
Don't underestimate light.

05:05.006 --> 05:06.339
Light.

05:06.341 --> 05:07.774
It's a food.

05:07.776 --> 05:10.743
It nourishes our bodies
with Vitamin D. It has mass.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.679
It occupies space.

05:12.681 --> 05:14.914
We now know it can be
slowed and stopped.

05:14.916 --> 05:16.749
Yes, stopped.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.918
It actually behaves differently
when it's being observed,

05:18.920 --> 05:21.954
almost like it's imbued
with a consciousness.

05:21.956 --> 05:25.391
Multiple wavelengths
of light mixed together

05:25.393 --> 05:28.895
give us white light, a
mixture of frequencies,

05:28.897 --> 05:31.631
all processed by our cortex.

05:31.633 --> 05:35.435
But odors... the cortex must
process different chemical

05:35.437 --> 05:40.440
structures and match them to a
stored database of known odors.

05:40.442 --> 05:44.377
I think current methods to
understand this limit us.

05:44.379 --> 05:47.080
They limit all olfactory-based
research, every single project

05:47.082 --> 05:48.815
in the world.

05:48.817 --> 05:52.652
If we can use light to
visualize specific pheromones,

05:52.654 --> 05:54.921
we've taken it to
the next level.

05:54.923 --> 05:57.423
Will your work also show
us why people near death

05:57.425 --> 06:00.927
see a white light?

06:00.929 --> 06:03.996
One concept our learned
colleagues in this room

06:03.998 --> 06:06.933
are familiar with is that
the near-death experience

06:06.935 --> 06:08.901
comes from the cortex
returning to full function

06:08.903 --> 06:10.970
after the body's gone
through a trauma.

06:10.972 --> 06:13.573
Sometimes our neuroscience
escapes those of us

06:13.575 --> 06:14.874
from the pharmaceutical
industry.

06:14.876 --> 06:16.776
Is a Bigfoot discovery
also imminent?

06:16.778 --> 06:19.045
I thought we agreed to keep
the work involving your wife's

06:19.047 --> 06:19.045
genetic code confidential.

06:19.047 --> 06:23.516
At least I know where to find
my wife... at home, at night.

06:23.518 --> 06:24.951
That's assuming you
left her inflated.

06:24.953 --> 06:26.986
Gentlemen.

06:26.988 --> 06:26.986
Thanks, Dr. Sutree.

06:26.988 --> 06:31.424
We will immediately review
your latest findings.

06:31.426 --> 06:32.992
We need to get to that
scheduled luncheon

06:32.994 --> 06:34.234
with the rest of the committee.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.776
You appear as if you've
come up empty-handed,

06:49.778 --> 06:51.978
then you feign a new
discovery and bite

06:51.980 --> 06:54.113
one of the hands that
feeds the institution?

06:54.115 --> 06:56.983
He obviously slipped through
the evolutionary sieve.

06:56.985 --> 06:58.918
That's what I'm
talking about, Jack.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.454
I mean, no one is expecting
blind ass-kissing.

07:01.456 --> 07:01.454
But these insults...

07:01.456 --> 07:04.090
ass-kissing isn't
the issue, Billy.

07:04.092 --> 07:05.825
Everyone knows redfield
got on the board

07:05.827 --> 07:05.825
because he's in bed
with the pill companies.

07:05.827 --> 07:09.162
And you can come up with
the millions necessary to run

07:09.164 --> 07:09.162
this branch of biochemistry?

07:09.164 --> 07:13.065
Kowtowing to a special interest
portends a myopic approach

07:13.067 --> 07:14.767
and a lack of respect
from our colleagues

07:14.769 --> 07:14.767
throughout the world.

07:14.769 --> 07:19.872
At least create the appearance
of respectability, especially

07:19.874 --> 07:22.942
when the work is questioned.

07:22.944 --> 07:26.012
Ram is a neuroscience
graduate from Yale.

07:26.014 --> 07:27.914
Medina is from the
Rockefeller university.

07:27.916 --> 07:30.049
Physics and mathematical
biology are her specialties.

07:30.051 --> 07:32.151
Do you seriously think
they'd be wasting their time

07:32.153 --> 07:33.653
with crackpot research?

07:33.655 --> 07:34.921
Where are you guys with this?

07:34.923 --> 07:36.756
The evidence that Dr.
Sutree has uncovered

07:36.758 --> 07:38.458
is very compelling.

07:38.460 --> 07:38.458
Definitely exciting.

07:38.460 --> 07:42.495
My colleagues were impressed
with the potential correlations

07:42.497 --> 07:44.931
discovered here.

07:44.933 --> 07:46.666
How close are you and your team?

07:46.668 --> 07:48.901
Could there be
something concrete

07:48.903 --> 07:51.571
by the end of the quarter?

07:51.573 --> 07:52.638
It's difficult to say.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.140
I'm going to see what I can do.

07:54.142 --> 07:55.142
But no more detours.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.618
Here are the latest orns.

08:05.620 --> 08:05.618
Anything interesting?

08:05.620 --> 08:08.554
It confirms you're on
the right track regarding

08:08.556 --> 08:10.223
odor discrimination.

08:10.225 --> 08:11.123
Good.

08:11.125 --> 08:13.659
I'll take it from here.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.595
How late you staying, boss?

08:15.597 --> 08:18.931
Just want to finish prepping
these detector compounds.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.033
Tomorrow.

08:21.035 --> 08:22.635
Thanks, ram.

08:22.637 --> 08:26.205
Are you and Mrs. Jack
still on for dinner?

08:26.207 --> 08:28.074
Of course.

08:28.076 --> 08:28.074
Hey.

08:28.076 --> 08:32.812
I'm having a send-off for
sunny-girl tomorrow afternoon.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.246
You can join me if you'd like.

08:34.249 --> 08:35.515
I'm there.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.152
I'm very saddened
with your loss, Jack.

08:40.154 --> 08:42.221
Sunny-girl was very special.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.825
She would certainly have been
honored by the Nepal Hindus.

08:45.827 --> 08:47.894
Don't worry, I'm not
going vicar on you.

08:47.896 --> 08:51.030
There was something unique
between you and sunny-girl.

08:51.032 --> 08:53.666
It was more than friendship.

08:53.668 --> 08:56.135
I'd call that spiritual.

08:56.137 --> 08:58.170
I'm sad.

08:58.172 --> 08:59.238
But spiritual?

09:02.209 --> 09:03.643
We are scientists.

09:03.645 --> 09:05.611
We compare one thing
relative to another.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.713
We connect to them in
a linear, rational way

09:07.715 --> 09:09.015
that makes sense to our brains.

09:09.017 --> 09:10.616
Could sunny-girl
speak words with you?

09:10.618 --> 09:11.951
No.

09:11.953 --> 09:14.086
Could she tell
when you were sad?

09:14.088 --> 09:16.322
Yes.

09:16.324 --> 09:18.324
She's gone now.

09:18.326 --> 09:23.262
Where do you feel it more...
here or deep inside here?

09:23.264 --> 09:25.865
There is a special kind of
intelligence inside here too.

09:25.867 --> 09:29.101
It's a spiritual intelligence...
a spiritual energy.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.873
It was more than friendship.

09:33.875 --> 09:34.875
It was spiritual.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.744
I appreciate the
kind thoughts, ram.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.115
I'm bringing a young lady friend

09:43.117 --> 09:46.018
who caught my eye to dinner.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.087
Let me know if you
think I have a chance.

10:17.919 --> 10:18.918
What?

10:18.920 --> 10:20.753
Ram, something's happening.

10:20.755 --> 10:22.388
He didn't even see me come in.

10:22.390 --> 10:25.925
He's been at it
for over an hour.

10:25.927 --> 10:27.627
My gosh.

10:27.629 --> 10:29.929
He's been here all night.

10:29.931 --> 10:30.997
All night?

10:34.401 --> 10:36.802
Making breakfast for everyone?

10:36.804 --> 10:38.404
I think we got
something here, ram.

10:38.406 --> 10:40.272
I plugged in the
discrimination factors,

10:40.274 --> 10:43.042
and they seem to have taken
things to the next level.

10:43.044 --> 10:45.945
Are we talking
practical or theoretical?

10:45.947 --> 10:47.847
I'm saying the cat's in the bag.

10:47.849 --> 10:49.949
But it appears the
bag may be too small.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.955
Ram.

10:55.957 --> 10:57.023
Hit the lights.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.274
Wow.

11:25.453 --> 11:26.453
Medina!

11:28.256 --> 11:29.256
Hang on.

11:30.291 --> 11:31.691
Don't rub, don't rub.

11:33.294 --> 11:34.294
You okay?

11:35.129 --> 11:35.995
Say something, Jack.

11:35.997 --> 11:37.096
Aah.

11:37.098 --> 11:38.698
Just keep breathing.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.203
Jack, doctor, say something.

11:44.906 --> 11:46.205
Are you okay?

11:46.841 --> 11:47.306
Okay.

11:47.308 --> 11:48.007
Here you go.

11:48.009 --> 11:48.441
Here you go.

11:48.443 --> 11:49.075
Here you go.

11:49.077 --> 11:49.775
Ugh!

11:49.777 --> 11:49.775
All right.

11:49.777 --> 11:50.910
Come on, this way.

11:50.912 --> 11:51.912
This way.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.881
I'm going to shut
down the experiment.

11:55.883 --> 11:55.881
All right.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.783
I'm going to check your eyes.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.151
Lean back, please.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.793
What?

12:07.795 --> 12:09.395
How do you feel?

12:09.397 --> 12:12.732
Like I was just shot
through the "2001" star gate.

12:12.734 --> 12:14.734
Wow, my eyes felt like
they were on fire.

12:24.811 --> 12:26.979
You were here all night, Jack.

12:26.981 --> 12:30.249
Well, after you left, I plugged
in the orn data you gave me.

12:30.251 --> 12:32.218
It fell right into place
with the theoretical values

12:32.220 --> 12:32.218
we set up.

12:32.220 --> 12:34.520
When I saw that, I
didn't want to stop.

12:34.522 --> 12:36.388
I needed to see if it
could actually work.

12:36.390 --> 12:38.190
Did it?

12:38.192 --> 12:39.925
I didn't get to test
all the wavelengths.

12:39.927 --> 12:44.797
But so far, no.

12:44.799 --> 12:45.898
Close but no cigar.

12:50.137 --> 12:53.339
Thanks, both of you.

12:53.341 --> 12:55.207
I know I can be a
taskmaster at times.

12:55.209 --> 12:58.277
And I appreciate you going
with the change in direction.

12:58.279 --> 13:01.447
We support your work, Jack.

13:01.449 --> 13:05.317
The other things, well,
just have a bit more faith

13:05.319 --> 13:06.385
in your staff.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.294
Mhm.

13:15.296 --> 13:17.263
You want some, Jack?

13:17.265 --> 13:17.263
No.

13:17.265 --> 13:20.900
But try to keep sunny-girl's
ashes curry-free, will you?

13:20.902 --> 13:23.202
Heh.

13:23.204 --> 13:25.404
Your eyes... is it the spices?

13:25.406 --> 13:27.086
You know, they've never
affected me before.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.811
Photophobia maybe?

13:31.813 --> 13:34.013
I don't know.

13:34.015 --> 13:35.047
Well, Jasmine is in bloom.

13:35.049 --> 13:37.283
Maybe allergies.

13:37.285 --> 13:38.365
Ram, roll down your window.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.198
Jack, are you okay?

14:00.841 --> 14:02.541
I feel a little dizzy.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.119
Jack?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.637
Jack, are you okay?

14:31.639 --> 14:32.639
You okay, Jack?

14:57.197 --> 15:00.199
Jack?

15:05.372 --> 15:07.673
I saw it.

15:07.675 --> 15:09.575
I saw it all.

15:09.577 --> 15:12.278
What did you see?

15:12.280 --> 15:14.413
The scent of the oranges.

15:14.415 --> 15:15.614
The flowers' attractants.

15:15.616 --> 15:16.615
The burnt hydrocarbons.

15:16.617 --> 15:17.516
I could see it, ram.

15:17.518 --> 15:18.550
It was all there.

15:18.552 --> 15:19.652
What did you see?

15:19.654 --> 15:21.520
Colors.

15:21.522 --> 15:26.492
Even your curry in your
container and on your breath.

15:26.494 --> 15:30.296
I could see the aromas swirling,
naturally flowing in the air.

15:30.298 --> 15:30.296
It was astonishing.

15:30.298 --> 15:32.631
You saw this without
the apparatus?

15:32.633 --> 15:33.966
Are you sure?

15:33.968 --> 15:36.568
Yes, yes, yes, of course.

15:36.570 --> 15:40.172
The gases I mixed in the
lab must be some residue.

15:40.174 --> 15:42.441
Why can you see this now?

15:42.443 --> 15:43.709
I don't know.

15:49.249 --> 15:52.685
You ever have a song
change your life?

15:52.687 --> 15:55.054
There's one from a while back.

15:55.056 --> 15:58.524
You might not be
familiar with it, ram.

15:58.526 --> 16:02.061
My dad used to play
it all the time.

16:02.063 --> 16:07.333
A song describing stardust
and billion-year-old carbon.

16:10.437 --> 16:15.074
Those words connected
who we are here

16:15.076 --> 16:16.816
to the stars in the universe.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.580
And I wanted to
be a part of that.

16:21.582 --> 16:23.015
That's why I went into science.

16:28.288 --> 16:31.590
Now I'm about to scatter
this very special collection

16:31.592 --> 16:33.492
of billion-year-old
carbon into the sea.

16:41.701 --> 16:42.768
Bye, girl.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.378
Ugh!

16:58.319 --> 16:59.319
Thanks, ram.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.689
Let's get back to the lab.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.196
The compounds must have gone
through some sort of change

17:12.199 --> 17:13.265
when the gases distilled.

17:13.267 --> 17:14.566
We can begin a full analysis.

17:14.568 --> 17:16.167
Just prepare everything
in the morning

17:16.170 --> 17:17.170
and wait till I get back.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.205
Tomorrow morning.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.075
Tomorrow morning.

17:23.077 --> 17:27.112
I have to see my mom and... oh,
damn, that freaking deposition.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.280
Billy, great.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.281
Whoa.

17:29.283 --> 17:30.115
What...

17:30.117 --> 17:31.050
oh, it's nothing.

17:31.052 --> 17:31.817
There's been a breakthrough.

17:31.819 --> 17:33.419
We have proof.

17:33.421 --> 17:35.521
Scents, smells
can be visualized.

17:35.523 --> 17:37.656
They can be seen without
any special instruments.

17:37.658 --> 17:37.656
Seriously?

17:37.658 --> 17:40.459
We're about to give every
institution researching

17:40.461 --> 17:42.494
Chemoreception a run
for its money, man.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.797
Can you see them now?

17:44.799 --> 17:44.797
It was only temporary.

17:44.799 --> 17:49.635
But I could see them flowing
out like hundreds of fountains

17:49.637 --> 17:49.635
and at different rates.

17:49.637 --> 17:52.704
Graham's law of effusion
seen with the naked eye.

17:52.706 --> 17:56.275
It was uncanny,
illuminating, a radical shift

17:56.277 --> 17:58.377
in our understanding
of the visual senses.

17:58.379 --> 18:01.246
Imagine an app on a smart device
that you move over a patient,

18:01.248 --> 18:03.615
and then it points you
in the right direction.

18:03.617 --> 18:06.151
Well, I'm glad I took action.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.786
What do you mean?

18:07.788 --> 18:10.722
The regents... they moved
to pull the funding.

18:10.724 --> 18:11.790
Oh.

18:16.729 --> 18:20.499
I came here to tell you there's
a separate fund I can tap.

18:20.501 --> 18:21.700
It's used for emergencies.

18:21.702 --> 18:24.803
It will allow you to
continue for a while.

18:24.805 --> 18:26.505
A while?

18:26.507 --> 18:27.606
Through next month.

18:27.608 --> 18:27.606
Christ, do me a favor.

18:27.608 --> 18:30.742
Smear some testosterone
cream between your legs

18:30.744 --> 18:30.742
and grow a pair.

18:30.744 --> 18:33.312
Don't you realize
what we have here?

18:33.314 --> 18:34.480
They're walking all over you!

18:37.450 --> 18:40.652
It will have to
do for now, Jack.

18:40.654 --> 18:44.556
And if what you're saying is
true, the funding will happen.

18:44.558 --> 18:45.624
All we need is the proof.

18:50.131 --> 18:53.232
Ram, let's keep
this quiet for now.

18:53.234 --> 18:56.268
Even from Medina?

18:56.270 --> 18:58.170
Yes.

18:58.172 --> 18:59.371
I'll lock up.

18:59.373 --> 19:00.373
See you at dinner.

19:33.174 --> 19:34.239
Damn.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.345
All right, there's got to
be a better way than this.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.385
Oh, hey, ram.

19:46.387 --> 19:47.686
Something came up.

19:47.688 --> 19:48.921
Melanie can't make it.

19:48.923 --> 19:51.256
Everything okay?

19:51.258 --> 19:53.659
Well, we're working
some things out.

19:53.661 --> 19:54.960
I've been staying
at my mom's house.

19:54.962 --> 19:56.295
No, no, I meant your eyes.

19:56.297 --> 19:57.396
You're rubbing them.

19:57.398 --> 19:59.364
Is it the same
sensation as earlier?

19:59.366 --> 20:01.200
Probably a latent effect.

20:01.202 --> 20:03.235
Something came up with
my dinner date as well.

20:03.237 --> 20:06.205
She brought a friend.

20:06.207 --> 20:08.367
How long have you been with
the university, Dr. Sutree?

20:20.353 --> 20:21.987
Sorry.

20:21.989 --> 20:21.987
Over a decade.

20:21.989 --> 20:26.692
And ram tells me that your lab
is involved with world health.

20:26.694 --> 20:30.262
Yes, practically every
university research group

20:30.264 --> 20:33.599
is trying to eradicate the
spread of malaria and dengue.

20:33.601 --> 20:36.368
Studying the odors
our bodies give off

20:36.370 --> 20:37.836
could be a way to help do that.

20:37.838 --> 20:40.839
Mosquitoes seem to be
attracted to these odors.

20:40.841 --> 20:42.741
Wouldn't improving
the infrastructure

20:42.743 --> 20:46.345
so that cleanliness wasn't
an issue keep them away?

20:46.347 --> 20:49.481
It's more complicated than that.

20:49.483 --> 20:52.484
Our bodies also
give off natural pheromones,

20:52.486 --> 20:54.386
regardless of our cleanliness.

20:54.388 --> 20:58.423
Sounds like there is more
to attraction than just

20:58.425 --> 21:02.761
wearing aftershave or perfume.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.663
Oh, I daresay pheromone
detection would even

21:04.665 --> 21:07.266
be able to tell when
a woman is ovulating.

21:07.268 --> 21:11.837
Dr. Sutree, has your department
tapped into the data mining

21:11.839 --> 21:14.973
modules that Brenda's
group has developed?

21:14.975 --> 21:16.341
Not that I'm aware of.

21:16.343 --> 21:18.744
John is an amazing programmer.

21:18.746 --> 21:21.580
He's been assisting me on
the voice-pert project.

21:21.582 --> 21:24.883
The goal is for workers
throughout the state health

21:24.885 --> 21:28.687
care system to be able
to instantaneously search

21:28.689 --> 21:31.723
any database via
voice recognition.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.925
She's just impressed because I'm

21:33.927 --> 21:36.328
really sensitive to
semicolons and parentheses.

21:37.598 --> 21:39.931
So John, will you be
staying and ordering

21:39.933 --> 21:42.601
food or just having a drink?

21:42.603 --> 21:43.802
Yeah.

21:43.804 --> 21:43.802
I haven't eaten.

21:43.804 --> 21:47.072
I only ask because when I
invited Brenda to dinner,

21:47.074 --> 21:49.474
I didn't know that an expert
in parentheses and semicolons

21:49.476 --> 21:50.742
would be joining us.

21:50.744 --> 21:53.345
Oh, I apologize, ram.

21:53.347 --> 21:56.315
I just thought it would be good
for John to meet Dr. Sutree.

21:56.317 --> 21:57.482
We'll take care of our part.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.617
No problem, dude.

21:58.619 --> 21:59.951
I can cover myself.

21:59.953 --> 22:01.887
How about some oyster shooters?

22:01.889 --> 22:01.887
Yeah.

22:01.889 --> 22:05.524
We're doing studies on
parasites that cannot survive

22:05.526 --> 22:08.060
without their host or hostess.

22:08.062 --> 22:09.861
Cool.

22:09.863 --> 22:11.897
Did I miss
something, Dr. Sutree?

22:11.899 --> 22:13.865
Oh, I was just
thinking, it's a bold man

22:13.867 --> 22:15.801
who first ate an oyster.

22:15.803 --> 22:17.703
Tell me about it.

22:17.705 --> 22:19.838
Well, that was one of the
most interesting dinners

22:19.840 --> 22:20.906
I've ever had.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.815
Do you think I have a
chance with Brenda, Jack?

22:30.717 --> 22:32.651
Ram, there's a
western expression

22:32.653 --> 22:34.419
that associates
potential romance

22:34.421 --> 22:36.922
with an ocean of sea life.

22:36.924 --> 22:38.523
You may want to
swim yourself over

22:38.525 --> 22:39.845
to a different
section of the sea.

24:55.495 --> 24:58.196
This pair seems a bit small, ma.

24:58.198 --> 25:01.633
I've always been a size 7.

25:01.635 --> 25:03.935
I guarantee you not
one part of my body

25:03.937 --> 25:06.171
has grown with that
food they give me.

25:06.173 --> 25:07.873
Grown with?

25:07.875 --> 25:10.809
I thought you were
a proud grammarian.

25:10.811 --> 25:12.844
Being chair-bound for a
year could have something

25:12.846 --> 25:14.746
to do with it, don't you think?

25:14.748 --> 25:15.814
Nonsense.

25:15.816 --> 25:16.816
There we go.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.853
If it feels too tight, I
don't want you wearing them,

25:21.855 --> 25:23.822
no matter how good they look.

25:23.824 --> 25:27.526
You sometimes have to
suffer for beauty, hon.

25:27.528 --> 25:32.063
You're already beautiful, and
it wasn't from any suffering.

25:32.065 --> 25:33.899
Your father wouldn't
have agreed with that.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.606
I'll take them.

25:41.608 --> 25:44.576
Okay.

25:44.578 --> 25:46.144
One, two, three.

25:48.981 --> 25:52.250
Are you comfortable, Katie?

25:52.252 --> 25:54.252
I'm okay.

25:54.254 --> 25:57.122
Nurse?

25:57.124 --> 25:59.658
Why did the doctor add
these three new medications?

25:59.660 --> 26:04.763
Your mother was complaining
she wasn't able to get to sleep.

26:04.765 --> 26:06.231
Ma, how do you feel?

26:06.233 --> 26:07.732
I'm tired.

26:10.303 --> 26:12.503
Ask the doctor not to be so
liberal with the medication.

26:15.875 --> 26:20.111
Shoe shopping is exhausting,
even for a young person.

26:20.113 --> 26:21.680
I got to go now, ma.

26:21.682 --> 26:24.215
I'm heading downtown.

26:24.217 --> 26:27.152
A new one?

26:27.154 --> 26:31.289
I finished it in art
class a few days ago.

26:31.291 --> 26:34.025
Beautiful.

26:34.027 --> 26:35.327
I love you.

26:35.329 --> 26:36.595
Rest.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.263
Do you know him, Mr. Sutree?

27:12.265 --> 27:13.932
I thought I did, but no.

27:13.934 --> 27:17.802
Why are you taking his picture?

27:17.804 --> 27:19.771
How does he look to you?

27:19.773 --> 27:22.173
He wasn't doing
well last evening.

27:22.175 --> 27:25.310
But he's stable now.

27:25.312 --> 27:26.978
You okay?

27:26.980 --> 27:28.113
I'm late for a meeting.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.853
Dr.
Sutree has arrived.

27:34.855 --> 27:37.822
Thank you.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.958
My apologies for the delay.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.894
Just be seated, Dr.
Sutree, and we'll begin.

27:42.896 --> 27:45.330
We appreciate you agreeing
to be an expert witness.

27:45.332 --> 27:47.966
Sure.

27:47.968 --> 27:50.402
Could I have some water, please?

27:50.404 --> 27:52.971
This is the videotaped
deposition of John Benjamin

27:52.973 --> 27:55.707
Sutree taken by counsel for
the plaintiff in the matter

27:55.709 --> 27:59.010
of "Karin Honeygrove versus
Bioren Pharmaceuticals,"

27:59.012 --> 28:01.713
held in the offices of Tromo,
Gatelitt, Roberts located

28:01.715 --> 28:04.816
at 304 Broadway, Los
Angeles, California.

28:04.818 --> 28:06.985
If counsel would now please
state their appearances

28:06.987 --> 28:09.220
starting with the party
noticing this deposition.

28:09.222 --> 28:11.222
Marsha tweed,
representing the plaintiff.

28:11.224 --> 28:13.992
Van Tromo, representing
Bioren pharmaceuticals.

28:13.994 --> 28:15.794
Please state your
full legal name.

28:15.796 --> 28:17.195
And John Benjamin Sutree.

28:17.197 --> 28:19.931
And Mr. Sutree, what is
your present home address?

28:19.933 --> 28:23.101
815 garden road... sorry.

28:23.103 --> 28:26.938
1956 victory Lane, Los Angeles.

28:26.940 --> 28:28.139
How long have you lived there?

28:28.141 --> 28:32.010
Um, two months.

28:32.012 --> 28:33.478
Please raise your right hand.

28:33.480 --> 28:36.347
Do you solemnly swear that the
testimony you will give here

28:36.349 --> 28:38.917
in this deposition proceeding
be the truth, the whole truth,

28:38.919 --> 28:40.018
and nothing but the truth?

28:40.020 --> 28:41.219
I do.

28:41.221 --> 28:43.154
Are you here today
under subpoena, sir?

28:43.156 --> 28:44.889
Yes, I am.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.458
Let's start with your
medical background.

28:46.460 --> 28:48.293
Are you a medical doctor?

28:48.295 --> 28:50.361
No, I'm a doctor of science.

28:50.363 --> 28:52.831
I have a PHD in biological
sciences from Stanford.

28:52.833 --> 28:54.365
Any other degrees?

28:54.367 --> 28:57.168
A bachelor's in
physics and a master's

28:57.170 --> 29:00.271
in medical biochemistry from
the university of Chicago.

29:00.273 --> 29:02.507
Doctor, what is your
current occupation?

29:02.509 --> 29:04.743
I'm employed as the head
of olfactory research

29:04.745 --> 29:04.743
at city university.

29:04.745 --> 29:08.513
Did you attend the meeting
at Bioren pharmaceuticals

29:08.515 --> 29:11.483
December 17, 2010?

29:11.485 --> 29:14.452
I did attend the meeting,
but I'm not sure of the date.

29:14.454 --> 29:17.989
Why did you attend the meeting?

29:17.991 --> 29:21.259
Specifically to do a detailed
analysis of the ingredients

29:21.261 --> 29:23.895
for a new aerosol spray that
permitted the user to inhale

29:23.897 --> 29:26.865
rather than digest vitamins.

29:26.867 --> 29:29.067
We were there to present
our take on the ingredients.

29:29.069 --> 29:30.835
At this meeting at
Bioren, Sir, was there

29:30.837 --> 29:33.071
discussion as to any possible
ill effects from the vitamin

29:33.073 --> 29:35.273
spray?

29:35.275 --> 29:37.242
That meeting encompassed
a number of findings,

29:37.244 --> 29:40.812
but none that I recall
discussed Noxae Gradients.

29:40.814 --> 29:43.481
Spell that please.

29:43.483 --> 29:47.519
N-o-x-a-e.

29:47.521 --> 29:49.854
And does that mean?

29:49.856 --> 29:51.156
It's the plural of noxious.

29:51.158 --> 29:52.857
It refers to a
poisonous substance.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.459
I object.

29:54.461 --> 29:56.094
We're beginning to
get into what sounds

29:56.096 --> 29:57.796
like protected materials.

29:57.798 --> 29:59.297
I'm instructing
you not to answer,

29:59.299 --> 30:01.466
as this information
violates a confidentiality

30:01.468 --> 30:03.168
agreement with Bioren.

30:03.170 --> 30:06.204
I further object under paragraph
9 of the case management order.

30:06.206 --> 30:08.106
On the contrary, he must answer.

30:08.108 --> 30:09.974
You are required to
answer the questions, sir.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.476
Just a moment.

30:11.478 --> 30:13.244
Maybe it's time we make a
phone call to judge Renfrew

30:13.246 --> 30:15.313
to discuss the terms of
the case management order.

30:15.315 --> 30:17.949
This entire line of
inquiry is in violation

30:17.951 --> 30:20.885
of a confidentiality agreement
and may violate the case

30:20.887 --> 30:20.885
management order.

30:20.887 --> 30:23.855
Sir, I don't know of anything
in the previous order that

30:23.857 --> 30:25.156
permits you to call
judge Renfrew when we're

30:25.158 --> 30:25.156
conducting the deposition.

30:25.158 --> 30:27.458
It's not fair to the witness.

30:27.460 --> 30:30.028
He hasn't finished his answer.

30:30.030 --> 30:32.397
Please complete your answer
about the Noxae ingredients.

30:32.399 --> 30:34.399
I'd like to call an
end of this for today.

30:34.401 --> 30:36.034
I told you, from
what we analyzed,

30:36.036 --> 30:36.034
the ingredients were fine.

30:36.036 --> 30:38.336
If you wish to draw
other conclusions,

30:38.338 --> 30:39.470
get them from someone else.

30:39.472 --> 30:40.405
But you can't just leave.

30:40.407 --> 30:41.840
You're here under a subpoena.

30:41.842 --> 30:41.840
Jack, please sit.

30:41.842 --> 30:44.876
I'm assuming you
people have put in the time

30:44.878 --> 30:47.979
to study the analyzes, the
results we all gathered.

30:47.981 --> 30:49.514
If you haven't,
you're all fools.

30:49.516 --> 30:52.016
I could get the research and
read it off to you if you like.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.084
Pretty exciting stuff.

30:53.086 --> 30:54.953
Was that a yes or no?

30:57.357 --> 30:59.224
It's a fuck you.

31:28.488 --> 31:32.190
Get yo' ass outta here!

31:32.192 --> 31:33.258
What you care?

31:33.260 --> 31:35.193
Leave him be, stalagmite!

31:35.195 --> 31:37.362
Yo, go somewhere else and do
some throw-ups or something.

31:37.364 --> 31:39.197
I'll get Remey to
whoop your ass.

31:39.199 --> 31:40.198
Sheeit.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.000
Busta lickin' punk!

31:42.002 --> 31:43.002
Bitch!

31:53.612 --> 31:54.679
You all right, mister.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.418
Holy shit.

32:00.420 --> 32:00.418
Yeah.

32:00.420 --> 32:05.123
You come running out that
building swatting the fuzzy

32:05.125 --> 32:06.991
or something like that.

32:06.993 --> 32:08.393
You're kidding.

32:08.395 --> 32:12.130
All I remember is I
was on my feet running.

32:12.132 --> 32:15.400
Now I got this pain in my head.

32:15.402 --> 32:18.603
Starts in your
feet then goes to your head.

32:18.605 --> 32:21.105
Just 'cause you feel it
means your roots aren't dead.

32:21.107 --> 32:24.008
La da Dee, la da da.

32:24.010 --> 32:28.546
La da Dee, la da da.

32:28.548 --> 32:30.481
Hey, don't worry.

32:30.483 --> 32:32.116
Nothing's missing.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.184
I made sure.

32:40.993 --> 32:42.060
Please.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.535
Please.

32:55.708 --> 32:56.708
What?

32:56.710 --> 32:58.376
You in love?

33:04.049 --> 33:05.116
My name's Jack.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.721
Bazemint.

33:09.723 --> 33:11.689
Bazemint tape.

33:11.691 --> 33:11.689
Bazemint tape?

33:11.691 --> 33:13.558
Yeah, what about it?

33:13.560 --> 33:14.192
No, no.

33:14.194 --> 33:15.693
Nothing.

33:15.695 --> 33:18.096
A musician, right?

33:18.098 --> 33:20.198
Better believe it.

33:20.200 --> 33:23.634
Well, I want to thank
you for watching over me.

33:23.636 --> 33:25.636
I got to go back to work now.

33:25.638 --> 33:27.105
How'd you know?

33:27.107 --> 33:28.172
What?

33:28.174 --> 33:30.641
I was into music?

33:30.643 --> 33:31.643
Easy... your name.

33:35.481 --> 33:39.117
You going to be
able to keep it real?

33:39.119 --> 33:40.318
Yeah.

33:40.320 --> 33:42.520
I just lost myself
a little earlier.

33:42.522 --> 33:44.555
Not normal for me.

33:44.557 --> 33:47.058
Yeah, I know what that's like.

33:47.060 --> 33:49.394
But you know what?

33:49.396 --> 33:53.097
There is nothing stranger
than a normal person.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.469
Thank you again, bazemint.

33:58.471 --> 34:00.605
You're very kind.

34:00.607 --> 34:02.640
Just don't be normal.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.797
Jack, what happened?

34:25.799 --> 34:25.797
Nothing.

34:25.799 --> 34:28.733
What are you doing?

34:28.735 --> 34:31.202
Measuring quantities
from the experiment.

34:31.204 --> 34:34.205
I thought I made it clear to
let things be until I returned.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.239
Dr. Bleu instructed me
to organize our work.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.842
But look what I found.

34:37.844 --> 34:40.244
Based on the quantities that we
started with and what was left,

34:40.246 --> 34:42.813
60 milliliters were expended.

34:42.815 --> 34:45.083
So it didn't take
much to have an effect.

34:45.085 --> 34:46.851
How much is left?

34:46.853 --> 34:49.454
2.82 liters.

34:49.456 --> 34:52.489
That's 92 more applications.

34:52.492 --> 34:52.489
Pardon?

34:52.492 --> 34:55.259
The effect diminishes
with time, ram.

34:55.261 --> 34:56.726
We need to make more.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.396
Everything's documented,
so it shouldn't

34:58.398 --> 35:00.465
be a problem to formulate.

35:00.467 --> 35:02.500
What's Bleu want
with the information?

35:02.502 --> 35:03.568
He didn't say.

35:10.476 --> 35:11.642
If your eyesight was any better,

35:11.644 --> 35:14.579
you'd be able to
see through people.

35:14.581 --> 35:16.314
What's that supposed to mean?

35:16.316 --> 35:17.415
Your vision's fine, Jack.

35:17.417 --> 35:19.417
Why so testy?

35:20.220 --> 35:21.419
I'm sorry, Hugo.

35:21.421 --> 35:22.420
Everything's hitting at once.

35:22.422 --> 35:24.422
What's new in your department?

35:24.424 --> 35:27.258
We have a few clinical trials
going on for redfield's group.

35:27.260 --> 35:29.760
One's on lowering
blood glucose levels

35:29.762 --> 35:34.132
with prednisolone acetate,
eye drops for diabetics.

35:34.134 --> 35:37.235
Is there no escaping the wake
of his pharmaceutical swill?

35:37.237 --> 35:38.803
I don't follow.

35:38.805 --> 35:41.139
He's smothering the firewall
between research and commerce.

35:41.141 --> 35:44.142
Ah, it's the times we're in,
Jack, with funding and all.

35:44.144 --> 35:46.377
He's got programs throughout
the county health system,

35:46.379 --> 35:49.680
in the prison system, even
at the state hospital.

35:49.682 --> 35:50.748
Teargarden?

35:53.285 --> 35:55.153
Limited liability risk.

35:55.155 --> 35:57.321
Testing new drugs on the insane.

35:57.323 --> 35:59.157
I didn't say that was going on.

35:59.159 --> 36:00.892
Oh, you don't have to.

36:00.894 --> 36:01.894
It's the redfield way.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.297
Thanks, Hugo.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.410
Jack.

36:19.412 --> 36:20.811
Here, I can't seem to open this.

36:20.813 --> 36:23.381
Come in.

36:23.383 --> 36:24.815
Surprised I'm here, right?

36:24.817 --> 36:26.184
In a church nave, yes.

36:26.186 --> 36:28.252
In my home, not at all.

36:28.254 --> 36:30.688
Well, I appreciate you getting
together on such short notice.

36:30.690 --> 36:32.757
You know, back in my
teens, I experienced

36:32.759 --> 36:34.725
one of the best
flavor sensations ever

36:34.727 --> 36:34.725
to hit my tongue.

36:34.727 --> 36:40.298
It started with a short crunch
followed by sweetness and then

36:40.300 --> 36:42.700
a zap of slight burning.

36:42.702 --> 36:42.700
You continued chewing.

36:42.702 --> 36:45.870
And when the combination
moved further into the mouth,

36:45.872 --> 36:49.273
oh, it was like a wave
of flavor breaking

36:49.275 --> 36:50.541
on the back of my tongue.

36:50.543 --> 36:54.512
And now, decades later, I plan
to recapture that experience.

36:54.514 --> 36:56.414
French, Vietnamese, Italian?

36:56.416 --> 36:56.414
Onion rings.

36:56.416 --> 36:59.450
You know, where the onion
doesn't get lost in the ring

36:59.452 --> 37:00.318
but still doesn't overpower it.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.886
I think they're ready.

37:01.888 --> 37:03.955
Right.

37:03.957 --> 37:08.693
Now, you and I are
going to experience

37:08.695 --> 37:12.530
a little bit of heaven
on this beautiful earth.

37:12.532 --> 37:13.532
There.

37:15.702 --> 37:17.835
Your meals always
give faith a good name.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.539
Stuart, something's happened.

37:20.540 --> 37:25.543
I can't for the
life of me explain.

37:25.545 --> 37:28.446
There was a lab accident
that affected my eyes.

37:28.448 --> 37:29.780
Your eyesight okay?

37:29.782 --> 37:29.780
Yes.

37:29.782 --> 37:34.685
I don't know how to tell
you with a straight face.

37:34.687 --> 37:37.788
I'm seeing things.

37:37.790 --> 37:40.291
While I'm awake,
in broad daylight.

37:40.293 --> 37:41.926
You're serious?

37:41.928 --> 37:44.362
I'm dead serious.

37:44.364 --> 37:47.298
My dog just passed away.

37:47.300 --> 37:51.402
But after the lab
accident, I saw her.

37:51.404 --> 37:57.775
She was there, so vivid in the
room, so real it hurt my heart.

37:57.777 --> 38:00.811
I was visiting my mother
in her nursing home.

38:00.813 --> 38:04.315
When I left, I saw an
elderly man in another room.

38:04.317 --> 38:07.752
Floating above him, I saw a
younger version of that man.

38:07.754 --> 38:10.054
I was just at a
deposition today.

38:10.056 --> 38:13.491
Sitting opposite me was an
executive I've never met.

38:13.493 --> 38:16.661
Then a separate lurid
vision of him appears.

38:16.663 --> 38:20.298
Maybe you have an explanation.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.400
Or am I losing it?

38:22.402 --> 38:23.901
Oh, I know you.

38:23.903 --> 38:23.901
You're not crazy.

38:23.903 --> 38:29.874
But to see something, you
have to believe in it, right?

38:29.876 --> 38:31.876
I look over there, and I
see an onion, because I

38:31.878 --> 38:33.711
believe it's an onion.

38:33.713 --> 38:37.014
I don't believe in
magic or pious spirits.

38:37.016 --> 38:38.749
Why the visions?

38:38.751 --> 38:40.518
Maybe you need to
approach this phenomenon

38:40.520 --> 38:43.454
in a different manner.

38:43.456 --> 38:44.922
The onion, please.

38:44.924 --> 38:47.091
Go ahead.

38:47.093 --> 38:50.494
Now, forget that you know it's
a bulbous, yellowish, brown

38:50.496 --> 38:52.063
vegetable, okay?

38:52.065 --> 38:55.032
Try to meet it on its own terms.

38:55.034 --> 38:56.767
It's a sphere, right?

38:56.769 --> 38:59.770
Well, look closely.

38:59.772 --> 39:02.073
Look at the bottom
and follow it up.

39:02.075 --> 39:04.642
It's not really a sphere.

39:04.644 --> 39:07.445
As a man of science
you might see

39:07.447 --> 39:12.650
that it's actually a bloom of
linear vectors pushing upwards.

39:12.652 --> 39:14.719
Now, peel off the outside layer.

39:14.721 --> 39:15.786
Go ahead.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.959
Notice how it's dry.

39:21.961 --> 39:24.128
But how dry?

39:24.130 --> 39:29.367
It's not of powdered dry or an
old crusty dry that crumbles.

39:29.369 --> 39:32.470
No, it's a fresh type of dry.

39:32.472 --> 39:35.506
In fact, compared to other
dry things in this world,

39:35.508 --> 39:39.910
you could say its dryness
is actually exquisite.

39:39.912 --> 39:41.812
Now, here.

39:41.814 --> 39:43.114
Slice it open.

39:43.116 --> 39:44.382
Go on.

39:48.453 --> 39:50.888
Ah, look at that.

39:50.890 --> 39:53.457
You've opened the
floodgates of being.

39:53.459 --> 39:56.127
Life inside of death.

39:56.129 --> 39:58.429
Now, how do we know it's alive?

39:58.431 --> 40:01.399
Try to put the two
halves back together.

40:01.401 --> 40:03.067
You can't.

40:03.069 --> 40:06.437
The pieces of its being
were held under compression,

40:06.439 --> 40:09.140
as are all living things.

40:09.142 --> 40:11.942
Now, notice we can't
escape the aroma that

40:11.944 --> 40:15.613
fills the air released
from its flowing juices.

40:15.615 --> 40:17.982
Just seconds ago, there
was very little smell.

40:17.984 --> 40:20.584
It was contained in
that exquisite dryness,

40:20.586 --> 40:23.921
if you remember.

40:23.923 --> 40:26.557
Shit, I'll never look at
an onion the same way again.

40:26.559 --> 40:29.527
When you see one
of those visions,

40:29.529 --> 40:32.797
forget any previous associations
that may come into your mind.

40:32.799 --> 40:35.599
Focus your consciousness deeply.

40:35.601 --> 40:38.068
Forget what you don't believe.

40:38.070 --> 40:40.137
Look at what it means to you.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.741
You're all fools.

40:43.743 --> 40:45.976
I can get the research and read
it off to you, if you like.

40:45.978 --> 40:45.976
Pretty exciting stuff.

40:45.978 --> 40:45.976
Would you like me to do that?

40:45.978 --> 40:50.581
Because if you
want me to, I will.

40:50.583 --> 40:53.784
Was that a yes or no?

40:53.786 --> 40:55.853
It's a fuck you.

40:55.855 --> 40:57.788
Jury profiling begins tomorrow.

40:57.790 --> 41:00.624
Jury selection is
around the corner.

41:00.626 --> 41:03.527
And you, our expert
witness, leave

41:03.529 --> 41:08.699
a deposition that could lead
to us losing the entire case.

41:08.701 --> 41:12.136
Listen, I'm exhausted.

41:12.138 --> 41:14.939
The pressure to produce results
has become almost unbearable.

41:14.941 --> 41:16.974
But I just can't stress
enough the importance

41:16.976 --> 41:19.043
of what we've stumbled
onto, especially

41:19.045 --> 41:21.846
now, because it's
taken a new twist.

41:21.848 --> 41:23.514
What are you
talking about, Jack?

41:23.516 --> 41:25.850
The vision enhancements
have deviated away

41:25.852 --> 41:26.852
from odor signatures.

41:29.189 --> 41:30.088
What is it?

41:30.089 --> 41:33.023
What are you talking about?

41:33.025 --> 41:35.826
Personality traits.

41:35.828 --> 41:39.096
Scientific results are
governed by perception.

41:39.098 --> 41:41.131
You know this better than
anyone here, Clayton.

41:41.133 --> 41:43.868
A drug is developed
to relieve chest pain.

41:43.870 --> 41:43.868
It fails.

41:43.870 --> 41:47.838
But someone looked at
that failure differently.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.807
It turns out it inhibits
an enzyme allowing blood

41:49.809 --> 41:51.208
to flow to the penis.

41:51.210 --> 41:54.812
It becomes the most
successful drug in history.

41:54.814 --> 41:57.281
Well, what we discovered
in the lab, the ability

41:57.283 --> 42:00.751
to see the aromas a
substance gives off,

42:00.753 --> 42:02.987
has shifted to
the ability to see

42:02.989 --> 42:06.524
what an individual emanates.

42:06.526 --> 42:10.828
You know how we describe someone
like, he beams confidence,

42:10.830 --> 42:13.163
or, she has a glow about her?

42:13.165 --> 42:15.533
There's now a way that
can actually be seen.

42:15.535 --> 42:17.902
It can be physically observed
and described in detail.

42:20.872 --> 42:21.939
Jack.

42:24.843 --> 42:29.113
This is a university
biomedical research department.

42:29.115 --> 42:32.283
We have 24 faculty Emeriti
who conduct ongoing research

42:32.285 --> 42:35.653
into cancer, infectious
diseases, physics,

42:35.655 --> 42:38.889
often in collaboration with
the heads of laboratories

42:38.891 --> 42:41.559
and hospitals around the world.

42:41.561 --> 42:44.795
They all stay in high esteem,
because they back up their work

42:44.797 --> 42:45.963
with confirmed experiment.

42:45.965 --> 42:50.701
You yourself... you
yourself... loudly

42:50.703 --> 42:53.270
proclaim that magical
thinking can't solve problems.

42:53.272 --> 42:56.874
But you continue to
make outrageous claims.

42:56.876 --> 42:58.742
The perception is that
the university's money

42:58.744 --> 43:01.178
and resources are being wasted.

43:01.180 --> 43:03.881
I think this has
gotten out of hand.

43:03.883 --> 43:05.883
You're right.

43:05.885 --> 43:08.085
What I've experienced
has to be formalized.

43:08.087 --> 43:10.754
I just wish you could
see it for yourself.

43:12.357 --> 43:14.959
Redfield, what's the most
important part of a court

43:14.961 --> 43:14.959
trial?

43:14.961 --> 43:19.363
It's happening within
days... jury selection.

43:19.365 --> 43:22.666
Clayton, what do you want
done with this project?

43:22.668 --> 43:23.901
Give me some additional time.

43:23.903 --> 43:26.837
That is no longer an option.

43:26.839 --> 43:28.806
Your dependability has
come into question.

43:28.808 --> 43:31.742
Can you give the baronial
attitude a rest and listen?

43:31.744 --> 43:33.644
Just one day.

43:33.646 --> 43:35.312
If I can't show you
something convincing

43:35.314 --> 43:37.214
by the end of tomorrow,
I'll do whatever you want.

43:37.216 --> 43:37.214
End the research.

43:37.216 --> 43:39.316
Give it to someone
else to continue.

43:39.318 --> 43:40.384
Anything.

43:42.754 --> 43:43.754
Come on, Clayton.

43:48.760 --> 43:49.760
24 hours.

43:53.331 --> 43:55.733
Do you see this button here?

43:55.735 --> 43:59.069
When you push it, it will
be similar to the burst

43:59.071 --> 44:01.772
of air you get when an
optometrist tests for glaucoma.

44:01.774 --> 44:02.873
Clever Medina.

44:02.875 --> 44:04.675
Now there won't be any waste.

44:04.677 --> 44:06.010
Thanks to Dr. Machado.

44:06.012 --> 44:07.845
Do I have enough for
three or four applications?

44:07.847 --> 44:09.246
Easily.

44:09.248 --> 44:12.049
Ram added the solution to
this small capsule here.

44:12.051 --> 44:14.084
Be sure everything is recorded.

44:14.086 --> 44:16.120
Got it.

44:16.122 --> 44:19.790
This enhancement in your
vision you described...

44:19.792 --> 44:20.858
why the sudden change?

44:20.860 --> 44:22.292
Did something happen at home?

44:27.866 --> 44:30.200
It's strange, ram.

44:30.202 --> 44:31.368
I was working.

44:31.370 --> 44:32.703
I dozed off.

44:32.705 --> 44:34.772
I woke up.

44:34.774 --> 44:36.173
Then I saw sunny-girl.

44:36.175 --> 44:37.241
Sunny-girl?

44:39.277 --> 44:41.011
Perhaps there is an
additional factor

44:41.013 --> 44:44.114
we are not considering...
the mix of our emotions

44:44.116 --> 44:44.114
and consciousness.

44:44.116 --> 44:48.819
We work in the representational
world defined by formulas.

44:48.821 --> 44:51.221
Yes, emotions can be an
obstacle to rational thought.

44:51.223 --> 44:53.223
But we also know
extreme emotional grief

44:53.225 --> 44:55.092
affects every part of the body.

44:55.094 --> 44:59.430
Stress can alter
the body chemistry.

44:59.432 --> 45:02.066
You're getting at what happens
with something like serotonin.

45:02.068 --> 45:04.001
Serious bereavement can
cause serotonin levels

45:04.003 --> 45:04.001
in the brain to drop.

45:04.003 --> 45:07.738
Hallucinations are associated
with neurotransmitter

45:07.740 --> 45:09.406
disturbances.

45:09.408 --> 45:11.942
Not a hallucination.

45:11.944 --> 45:14.011
The brain is more than
electrical and chemical

45:14.013 --> 45:17.881
reactions operating
in a chunk of meat.

45:17.883 --> 45:19.249
Consciousness is also in there.

45:19.251 --> 45:22.286
And this combination helped
to alter your perception

45:22.288 --> 45:26.490
from enhanced
observations... fragrances...

45:26.492 --> 45:31.295
to informed visions.

45:31.297 --> 45:36.366
Objective, persistent,
and timeless... those

45:36.368 --> 45:38.469
are the principles any
phenomenon needs to be held to.

45:38.471 --> 45:41.872
If your theory holds
up with those in mind,

45:41.874 --> 45:43.974
I'm willing to pass through
any doors of perception

45:43.976 --> 45:45.476
you're attempting to open.

45:45.478 --> 45:47.211
Yes, Jack.

45:47.213 --> 45:51.115
But we must also remember the
lesson that you taught us.

45:51.117 --> 45:53.383
Honor the elders,
embrace the new,

45:53.385 --> 45:56.320
and applaud the impracticable.

45:56.322 --> 45:57.788
Let's keep thinking about it.

45:57.790 --> 45:59.857
I've got to go.

46:31.923 --> 46:33.090
Hi.

46:33.092 --> 46:33.090
I'm Dr. Jack Sutree.

46:33.092 --> 46:36.927
I work with Dr. redfield in
the University Biosciences

46:36.929 --> 46:37.561
department.

46:37.563 --> 46:38.295
Trixie Tao.

46:38.297 --> 46:40.097
A pleasure.

46:40.099 --> 46:41.465
Is Dr. redfield attending today?

46:41.467 --> 46:43.000
No.

46:43.002 --> 46:45.135
I'm here to observe
the jury profiling.

46:45.137 --> 46:46.470
Why is that?

46:46.472 --> 46:48.505
I'm going to note any
characteristics that

46:48.507 --> 46:50.107
may not be obvious to others.

46:50.109 --> 46:53.410
Hopefully it will provide
some help for your process.

46:53.412 --> 46:56.146
I assure you we don't need
any assistance in what we do.

46:56.148 --> 46:56.146
Oh, I understand.

46:56.148 --> 47:01.852
It's sort of research for a
new approach Dr. redfield wants

47:01.854 --> 47:03.320
to explore.

47:03.322 --> 47:05.222
Do you have a way
different from ours

47:05.224 --> 47:07.057
to predict whether or not
a prospective juror may

47:07.059 --> 47:09.026
be dangerous to a case?

47:09.028 --> 47:11.929
Because we already cover
life experiences, predisposed

47:11.931 --> 47:13.564
attitudes, and believes.

47:13.566 --> 47:16.500
We go below the surface.

47:16.502 --> 47:18.001
Let's just say our
approach focuses

47:18.003 --> 47:21.071
on what's behind the person.

47:21.073 --> 47:23.941
Is there an area where
I'll be out of the way?

47:23.943 --> 47:25.175
Through that door.

47:25.177 --> 47:27.144
There's a small room
with a one-way glass.

47:27.146 --> 47:28.445
You'll have all the
privacy you need.

47:28.447 --> 47:30.280
Thanks Ms. Tao.

47:30.282 --> 47:31.982
Here.

47:31.984 --> 47:33.984
These are the
evaluation guidelines

47:33.986 --> 47:37.054
that our social scientists have
developed for each candidate.

47:37.056 --> 47:38.488
I'll make notes for each one.

47:38.490 --> 47:42.226
Knock yourself out.

47:42.228 --> 47:46.196
So as I was saying...

48:08.553 --> 48:11.221
what do you feel is
important about having laws?

48:11.223 --> 48:12.589
Everyone knows laws
were established

48:12.591 --> 48:15.058
for people's own good.

48:15.060 --> 48:17.928
It's dangerous when
laws are not obeyed.

48:17.930 --> 48:20.297
Is there ever a time when
the law should not be obeyed?

48:20.299 --> 48:20.297
Never.

48:20.299 --> 48:25.636
If people don't obey the law,
we would have total chaos.

48:25.638 --> 48:27.905
Whoa.

48:35.513 --> 48:39.116
Someone implies something
about you that is not true.

48:39.118 --> 48:40.584
How does that affect you?

48:40.586 --> 48:41.952
It doesn't.

48:41.954 --> 48:44.521
It doesn't affect me at all.

48:44.523 --> 48:47.658
We can't help it if someone
gets the wrong idea about us.

48:47.660 --> 48:49.259
Hmm.

48:49.261 --> 48:50.961
Can we help it if someone
says something about us

48:50.963 --> 48:54.364
that isn't true?

48:54.366 --> 48:57.467
Which us president
do you admire most?

48:57.469 --> 49:01.071
Why, our current president.

49:01.073 --> 49:02.073
Oh, really?

49:09.414 --> 49:12.049
Have you ever worked as a
janitor, been a business owner,

49:12.051 --> 49:13.417
or worked in a hospital?

49:13.419 --> 49:17.487
In college, I worked
part time as a janitor.

49:17.489 --> 49:20.023
Well, that's refreshing.

49:20.025 --> 49:22.025
Do you play the lottery?

49:22.027 --> 49:23.427
That's one vice
that I don't have.

49:26.297 --> 49:27.397
You sure about that?

49:31.369 --> 49:34.371
Do you feel drugs
should be legalized?

49:34.373 --> 49:35.373
They already are.

49:39.344 --> 49:41.111
What do you expect
when, as you're

49:41.113 --> 49:42.512
approaching a parking
spot, another car

49:42.514 --> 49:44.214
races by and takes it?

49:49.420 --> 49:52.456
The driver is in
the wrong to do that.

49:52.458 --> 49:55.592
And it makes me angry.

49:59.130 --> 49:59.997
Thank you.

49:59.999 --> 50:03.133
Candidate 14, please.

50:05.671 --> 50:07.504
What was the name of
the last book you read?

50:17.215 --> 50:18.749
"Four past midnight."

50:21.320 --> 50:23.520
Thank you.

50:26.524 --> 50:27.391
Roger?

50:27.393 --> 50:28.025
Roger.

50:28.027 --> 50:30.494
Call 911.

50:47.412 --> 50:50.580
What happened?

50:50.582 --> 50:53.483
You passed out and were
rushed to the hospital.

50:53.485 --> 50:56.153
No.

50:56.155 --> 50:59.222
What happened to us?

50:59.224 --> 51:00.757
Your walking shoes.

51:00.759 --> 51:03.360
For a moment, I thought
we were back in Paris.

51:03.362 --> 51:05.228
Rest, Jack.

51:05.230 --> 51:07.731
You're still out there.

51:07.733 --> 51:11.635
Could you close
that cabinet drawer?

51:11.637 --> 51:14.704
Now you're back.

51:14.706 --> 51:16.106
Mm.

51:16.108 --> 51:17.107
I'm serious, Mel.

51:17.109 --> 51:18.442
What happened to us?

51:23.715 --> 51:24.715
Answers would be nice.

51:27.752 --> 51:32.556
I'm just busy doing other
things now, just like you.

51:35.460 --> 51:37.227
Hi, I'm Jim Erlandson.

51:37.229 --> 51:37.861
Mrs. Sutree?

51:37.863 --> 51:39.229
Yes.

51:39.231 --> 51:40.530
Mr.
Sutree, I understand

51:40.532 --> 51:42.232
you were at a jury
selection procedure.

51:42.234 --> 51:44.468
Why were you there?

51:44.470 --> 51:46.269
I'm an expert witness in a case.

51:46.271 --> 51:48.738
Was there any stress
or trauma that occurred

51:48.740 --> 51:49.773
during the process?

51:49.775 --> 51:51.108
None, no.

51:51.110 --> 51:52.542
What about at work?

51:52.544 --> 51:55.712
Would you say the stress
level there is above normal?

51:55.714 --> 51:57.414
Where you going
with this, doctor?

51:57.416 --> 51:59.649
I'm a boring research
scientist at cu.

51:59.651 --> 52:02.185
You appear to be a
normally healthy individual.

52:02.187 --> 52:06.756
But your cortisol...
18, no more than 23

52:06.758 --> 52:09.659
micrograms per deciliter is okay.

52:09.661 --> 52:11.795
You came in here at over 50.

52:11.797 --> 52:11.795
Really?

52:11.797 --> 52:13.563
What is it now?

52:13.565 --> 52:14.331
It's okay.

52:14.333 --> 52:14.331
You're normal.

52:14.333 --> 52:17.367
It's just if it had stayed
that high, it would have

52:17.369 --> 52:19.369
started attacking your brain.

52:19.371 --> 52:21.705
Eventually you would have
gone into cardiac shock.

52:21.707 --> 52:29.246
Look, does your work expose
you to drugs or stimulants?

52:29.248 --> 52:30.247
Cut the crap.

52:30.249 --> 52:31.448
We don't abuse our privileges.

52:31.450 --> 52:32.682
Jack.

52:32.684 --> 52:34.551
Okay.

52:34.553 --> 52:37.754
You need to review your
last few days for anything

52:37.756 --> 52:40.323
unusual, anything
you reacted to,

52:40.325 --> 52:43.860
anything that caused
emotional distress.

52:43.862 --> 52:46.563
Because if what happened
today happens again,

52:46.565 --> 52:49.666
your wife is going to
visit you on a slab.

52:49.668 --> 52:51.268
He came in
like Dr. Jekyll.

52:51.270 --> 52:52.169
But wouldn't you know?

52:52.171 --> 52:53.470
He's Mr. Hyde.

52:53.472 --> 52:55.539
Could you hand me my phone?

53:00.244 --> 53:02.946
What happened today?

53:02.948 --> 53:05.549
I've stumbled onto
something, Mel.

53:05.551 --> 53:05.549
I don't understand it all yet.

53:05.551 --> 53:11.421
But it seems to be something
that will make some noise

53:11.423 --> 53:13.657
and change things.

53:13.659 --> 53:15.959
You are lying in a hospital
bed with your vital signs

53:15.961 --> 53:15.959
on display.

53:15.961 --> 53:17.894
Haven't things changed enough?

53:17.896 --> 53:18.929
He said I'm fine.

53:18.931 --> 53:19.931
What's on the other side?

53:23.501 --> 53:25.569
I'm not chasing
the cat this time.

53:25.571 --> 53:27.304
Your work is removed
from real life.

53:34.545 --> 53:38.315
And I know what happened to us.

53:38.317 --> 53:40.350
Your work removed you
from our marriage.

53:40.352 --> 53:42.252
Dr. Sutree?

53:42.254 --> 53:44.321
Hold on, ram.

53:46.724 --> 53:47.724
Why do you do it?

53:50.895 --> 53:52.929
I guess for the same reasons
you and I walk together

53:52.931 --> 53:55.265
along the left bank.

53:55.267 --> 53:56.267
It's exciting.

53:59.270 --> 54:00.670
And it makes me happy.

54:03.975 --> 54:05.809
Sorry, ram.

54:05.811 --> 54:09.813
Sutree showed up during
jury profiling yesterday.

54:09.815 --> 54:10.714
Why?

54:10.716 --> 54:10.714
How would I know?

54:10.716 --> 54:14.651
He became sick and
was hospitalized.

54:14.653 --> 54:15.352
What?

54:15.354 --> 54:15.885
What happened?

54:15.887 --> 54:15.885
Where is he?

54:15.887 --> 54:17.387
Oh, he's discharged.

54:21.292 --> 54:23.627
We should think
about shifting gears.

54:23.629 --> 54:25.562
He has good predocs
working with him.

54:25.564 --> 54:26.844
We should put them
to better use.

54:47.518 --> 54:49.019
There's a decline effect, ram.

54:49.021 --> 54:50.620
How do you mean?

54:50.622 --> 54:52.756
I lost the ability to
see into people yesterday.

54:52.758 --> 54:54.291
Even after repeated
applications,

54:54.293 --> 54:56.459
the effect never came back.

54:56.461 --> 54:58.595
And I've run out of time.

54:58.597 --> 55:01.865
Any idea what
might have changed?

55:01.867 --> 55:04.768
The effect first
happened within an hour,

55:04.770 --> 55:07.003
when we were driving.

55:07.005 --> 55:09.939
It came back later that
evening at the restaurant.

55:09.941 --> 55:11.808
And then when I went home,
I experienced it again.

55:11.810 --> 55:11.808
No.

55:11.810 --> 55:13.710
No, it went away at that point.

55:13.712 --> 55:15.378
I could no longer see aromas.

55:15.380 --> 55:18.848
The condition progressed
to the visions.

55:18.850 --> 55:22.886
I still think it's related to
one subjective consciousness.

55:22.888 --> 55:25.622
Emotion was part of it.

55:25.624 --> 55:29.459
The first vision was sunny-girl.

55:29.461 --> 55:31.561
But the man at the
nursing home, the lawyer,

55:31.563 --> 55:33.396
the deposition, the
jury pool... none of them

55:33.398 --> 55:34.364
meant anything to me.

55:34.366 --> 55:34.998
No, no, Jack.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.366
The trigger.

55:36.368 --> 55:37.967
I'm talking about
a triggering agent.

55:37.969 --> 55:40.570
It sets things in motion.

55:40.572 --> 55:43.840
You were so distressed when we
scattered sunny-girl's ashes.

55:49.447 --> 55:51.715
Sunny-girl.

55:51.717 --> 55:54.651
Ram, sunny-girl.

55:54.653 --> 55:55.653
Billion-year-old carbon.

55:59.490 --> 56:00.557
The song?

56:03.561 --> 56:05.795
Hey, you tell your students
that using your formula app

56:05.797 --> 56:06.696
is cheating.

56:06.698 --> 56:08.665
It's my app.

56:08.667 --> 56:09.966
Sweet app.

56:09.968 --> 56:11.835
The most important
element in life.

56:11.837 --> 56:13.703
The thing that ties
everything together.

56:13.705 --> 56:15.905
It was added when her
ashes flew into my eyes.

56:15.907 --> 56:18.074
After a few hours, it
altered the effect.

56:18.076 --> 56:18.942
Bazinga!

56:18.944 --> 56:20.510
Ashes!

56:20.512 --> 56:21.778
Activated carbon.

56:21.780 --> 56:23.079
A purifying agent.

56:23.081 --> 56:25.682
I'll wager my life it's
the triggering agent.

56:25.684 --> 56:27.484
Billion-year-old carbon!

56:27.486 --> 56:28.551
Yes!

56:34.125 --> 56:35.592
Careful.

56:35.594 --> 56:37.660
It's super... get it
all on the plastic.

56:40.765 --> 56:42.832
Go ahead.

56:44.735 --> 56:46.803
Okay.

57:08.559 --> 57:09.793
Okay, here we go.

57:17.735 --> 57:20.170
Are you okay?

57:20.172 --> 57:22.105
Wow.

57:22.107 --> 57:23.107
It feels robust.

57:39.056 --> 57:40.490
Damn.

57:40.492 --> 57:42.459
Too many variables are at work.

57:43.762 --> 57:45.562
We need a subject to
properly document this,

57:45.564 --> 57:48.898
or it remains a theorem
without any proof.

57:48.900 --> 57:51.067
The psychology department
has the biggest research pool.

57:51.069 --> 57:52.735
Do you want me to get
someone from there?

57:58.476 --> 58:00.143
No.

58:00.145 --> 58:01.678
I have someone in mind.

58:07.618 --> 58:09.686
I'll be back.

59:04.575 --> 59:06.109
Listen, mister.

59:06.111 --> 59:08.745
I don't turn tricks, if that's
why you wanted to meet me.

59:08.747 --> 59:10.880
No, no, nothing like that.

59:10.882 --> 59:12.782
I'm from cu.

59:12.784 --> 59:14.284
Speak English.

59:14.286 --> 59:16.653
The university down the road.

59:16.655 --> 59:19.255
You a teacher?

59:19.257 --> 59:21.190
More of a scientist.

59:21.192 --> 59:22.158
Bioscience.

59:22.160 --> 59:24.761
I study ways to improve life.

59:24.763 --> 59:26.029
Look around here.

59:26.031 --> 59:27.931
You got your work cut
out for you, playa.

59:34.038 --> 59:38.174
Those supposed to mean you cool?

59:38.176 --> 59:40.243
What, these?

59:41.679 --> 59:44.647
You may be a
professor, but you in

59:44.649 --> 59:47.050
need of some serious
Street-creducation.

59:47.052 --> 59:49.218
Do you remember when you
helped me the other day?

59:49.220 --> 59:52.322
Yeah, when you was running
like a mad scientist?

59:52.324 --> 59:54.290
Very good, yes.

59:54.292 --> 59:58.928
Well, you struck me as a
possible subject for our study.

59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.230
You want to study bazemint?

01:00:01.232 --> 01:00:03.232
What for?

01:00:03.234 --> 01:00:04.300
I'll be honest.

01:00:04.302 --> 01:00:06.169
I don't know.

01:00:06.171 --> 01:00:11.074
But when we first
met, I saw potential.

01:00:11.076 --> 01:00:14.010
And I think there's
value in pursuing that.

01:00:14.012 --> 01:00:17.313
Are you sure you're
not trying to mingle me?

01:00:17.315 --> 01:00:18.815
Mingle you?

01:00:18.817 --> 01:00:22.051
Yeah, because I don't do that.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:27.390
Anymore.

01:00:27.392 --> 01:00:30.193
Look, I'm not planning
any tricks here.

01:00:30.195 --> 01:00:34.297
I assure you my intentions
are strictly scientific.

01:00:34.299 --> 01:00:35.299
And the cheese?

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.884
I can get you a couple
hundred dollars for your time.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:51.014
What you looking
for, professor Jack?

01:00:51.016 --> 01:00:53.383
That, bazemint,
is precisely what I

01:00:53.385 --> 01:00:54.751
hope you can help me find out.

01:01:01.392 --> 01:01:03.292
This gonna be on YouTube?

01:01:03.294 --> 01:01:05.662
Scientific experiment or
cat video... I wonder which

01:01:05.664 --> 01:01:08.331
will get more hits.

01:01:08.333 --> 01:01:09.373
Y'all got Al-Gore-rhythms?

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:15.204
Algorithms?

01:01:15.206 --> 01:01:16.906
Yes, we use them.

01:01:16.908 --> 01:01:18.908
That shit really
gone change the world?

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:22.712
They already have, for sure.

01:01:22.714 --> 01:01:24.681
What's your name again?

01:01:24.683 --> 01:01:25.782
Ram.

01:01:25.784 --> 01:01:27.984
You named after a goat?

01:01:27.986 --> 01:01:29.252
My full name is ramble.

01:01:29.254 --> 01:01:32.021
You named after a
goat taking a stroll?

01:01:32.023 --> 01:01:33.790
My father's name
is Penku Tambel.

01:01:33.792 --> 01:01:33.790
He's a big creedence fan.

01:01:33.792 --> 01:01:36.759
So he named me after
his favorite song,

01:01:36.761 --> 01:01:39.328
"ramble tamble," except mine
is spelled with an e-l, not

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:39.996
an I-e.

01:01:39.998 --> 01:01:41.364
Jeez Louise.

01:01:41.366 --> 01:01:43.266
Sorry I asked.

01:01:43.268 --> 01:01:46.469
We're all set, Jack.

01:01:46.471 --> 01:01:49.005
You ready?

01:01:49.007 --> 01:01:50.440
What I'm supposed to do?

01:01:50.442 --> 01:01:51.974
Just relax.

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:50.299
You all right?

01:02:50.301 --> 01:02:54.403
I don't know what
it is about you.

01:02:54.405 --> 01:02:56.072
Yeah, I get that a lot.

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:01.344
How does it look, ram?

01:03:01.346 --> 01:03:03.279
There is a lot here, Jack.

01:03:03.281 --> 01:03:06.282
The good news... your
heart rate stayed normal.

01:03:06.284 --> 01:03:08.551
You were never at risk.

01:03:08.553 --> 01:03:10.086
Are you all right?

01:03:10.088 --> 01:03:11.087
Yeah.

01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:13.990
Was that okay?

01:03:13.992 --> 01:03:17.160
Why did you hold my shoulder?

01:03:17.162 --> 01:03:19.428
You looked like you needed help.

01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:23.800
Did I screw up already?

01:03:23.802 --> 01:03:24.934
No.

01:03:24.936 --> 01:03:26.569
No, you were fine.

01:03:26.571 --> 01:03:29.205
We've had a good start.

01:03:29.207 --> 01:03:32.108
I need to study what we
did here before we do more.

01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:34.443
Can I call upon
you in another day

01:03:34.445 --> 01:03:37.046
or so to do another session?

01:03:37.048 --> 01:03:38.114
Okay.

01:03:41.385 --> 01:03:45.454
But I need something else.

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:08.010
Well, my funds are limited.

01:04:08.012 --> 01:04:09.145
Don't trip off that.

01:04:09.147 --> 01:04:11.581
I don't want more cheese.

01:04:11.583 --> 01:04:16.085
I want you to find
someone for me.

01:04:16.087 --> 01:04:19.155
Find someone?

01:04:19.157 --> 01:04:21.624
That's not what we do.

01:04:21.626 --> 01:04:23.926
But you full of
science swag here.

01:04:23.928 --> 01:04:23.926
I mean, look around.

01:04:23.928 --> 01:04:28.598
You got some serious,
ginormous science swag.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.200
We wouldn't be the best
people to help locate someone.

01:04:31.202 --> 01:04:33.336
I don't even know
where to begin.

01:04:33.338 --> 01:04:34.937
You a scientist?

01:04:34.939 --> 01:04:36.439
Yes.

01:04:36.441 --> 01:04:39.542
You a scientist,
in a big-ass school.

01:04:39.544 --> 01:04:42.011
And you got
Al-Gore-rhythms, right?

01:04:42.013 --> 01:04:43.946
Algorithms, correct.

01:04:43.948 --> 01:04:45.114
Listen.

01:04:45.116 --> 01:04:46.249
You got computers.

01:04:46.251 --> 01:04:46.249
You got a way to do it.

01:04:46.251 --> 01:04:49.919
No one else has ever cared
to help me with this.

01:04:49.921 --> 01:04:52.989
There are missing persons
organizations that can help.

01:04:52.991 --> 01:04:55.091
Don't you think I
seen them already?

01:04:55.093 --> 01:04:56.225
They couldn't do nothing.

01:04:56.227 --> 01:04:59.195
It's different if
you give it a try.

01:04:59.197 --> 01:05:01.898
Look, you says you
want to improve life.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.033
Start with me.

01:05:04.035 --> 01:05:05.368
Start with this life.

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:15.378
I can't promise we'll
succeed, but I tell you what.

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:18.047
We'll give it a shot.

01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:20.149
Who do you want to find?

01:05:20.151 --> 01:05:23.986
Well, it's hard to
talk about, because it

01:05:23.988 --> 01:05:25.254
ain't no one's business.

01:05:25.256 --> 01:05:26.256
It's your mother.

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:36.165
How did you know I... I want
to know where's my mama?

01:05:36.167 --> 01:05:37.533
Is she still in the area?

01:05:37.535 --> 01:05:38.535
Did she move away?

01:05:41.004 --> 01:05:44.640
It's been so long.

01:05:44.642 --> 01:05:49.478
And she was always sick.

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:53.549
But I think she's around here.

01:05:56.486 --> 01:05:58.421
Can you help me find her?

01:05:58.423 --> 01:05:59.423
We'll try.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:03.693
Thank you.

01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:07.530
Professor Jack, when
you were staring at me,

01:06:07.532 --> 01:06:09.398
what did you see?

01:06:12.103 --> 01:06:13.823
I still need more time
to understand things.

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:19.542
But I can tell you this.

01:06:19.544 --> 01:06:22.078
Don't ever deny yourself and
your ability to do things,

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.714
Bazemint.

01:06:24.716 --> 01:06:27.216
You know your
friend from dinner?

01:06:27.218 --> 01:06:28.317
Brenda?

01:06:28.319 --> 01:06:28.317
Yes.

01:06:28.319 --> 01:06:31.220
She's working with the
county health administration.

01:06:31.222 --> 01:06:33.122
Ask if she can check
if Bazemint's mom ever

01:06:33.124 --> 01:06:35.992
turned up in the system.

01:06:35.994 --> 01:06:36.993
What is her name?

01:06:36.995 --> 01:06:39.061
Nina.

01:06:39.063 --> 01:06:40.663
Nina Orleans.

01:06:40.665 --> 01:06:44.467
And what name did
your mother give you?

01:06:44.469 --> 01:06:46.669
Simone.

01:06:46.671 --> 01:06:48.604
Simone.

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:55.544
Redfield.

01:06:55.546 --> 01:06:57.346
Dr.
redfield, it's Trixie Tao.

01:06:57.348 --> 01:06:58.714
We had enhanced
background checks done

01:06:58.716 --> 01:07:00.182
on all the prospective jurors.

01:07:00.184 --> 01:07:01.617
It's unbelievable.

01:07:01.619 --> 01:07:03.252
What's unbelievable?

01:07:03.254 --> 01:07:04.653
I'd understand

01:07:04.655 --> 01:07:06.555
if he was correct about
two, maybe three, people.

01:07:06.557 --> 01:07:06.555
That's the norm.

01:07:06.557 --> 01:07:10.259
But he was spot on with
every single person.

01:07:10.261 --> 01:07:12.194
We've never seen that before.

01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:13.329
Details, Ms. Tao.

01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:15.598
Who is he?

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.666
Your
colleague, Dr. sutree.

01:07:17.668 --> 01:07:19.568
He flagged several of
the potential jurors

01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:21.804
as not trustworthy
before he became ill.

01:07:21.806 --> 01:07:23.806
They all had passed the
initial standard screening

01:07:23.808 --> 01:07:25.541
that was done.

01:07:25.543 --> 01:07:27.510
But when we went back and fed
the info into our new security

01:07:27.512 --> 01:07:30.413
tap, six of the individuals
had enough in their backgrounds

01:07:30.415 --> 01:07:32.348
to make them ineligible.

01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:34.116
I just sent the results to you.

01:07:34.118 --> 01:07:35.251
By the way, how is he?

01:07:35.253 --> 01:07:36.719
I need to contact him.

01:07:36.721 --> 01:07:38.788
Do you know what this means
for any challenge that

01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:40.122
ends up in front of a jury?

01:07:40.124 --> 01:07:41.090
Yeah, don't worry.

01:07:41.092 --> 01:07:42.324
I'll set something up.

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:47.830
Here's what we came up with.

01:07:47.832 --> 01:07:50.433
There is a Nina
Orleans in the system.

01:07:50.435 --> 01:07:53.369
Committed to teargarden
15 years ago.

01:07:53.371 --> 01:07:54.703
An addict.

01:07:54.705 --> 01:07:57.139
Apparently the addiction
took her over the edge.

01:07:57.141 --> 01:07:58.808
She had a daughter.

01:07:58.810 --> 01:08:01.210
And the daughter was taken
away and placed in foster care.

01:08:01.212 --> 01:08:02.278
That's who we're looking for!

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.379
Is she still there?

01:08:03.381 --> 01:08:05.247
Oh, there's an issue
with teargarden.

01:08:05.249 --> 01:08:07.216
They've never kept good records.

01:08:07.218 --> 01:08:08.551
They've since cleaned house.

01:08:08.553 --> 01:08:11.787
About five years ago,
the times ran an expose.

01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:14.490
Unfortunately, there's a
gap in the information.

01:08:14.492 --> 01:08:16.392
Is there another
place we can look?

01:08:16.394 --> 01:08:18.260
Well, I would suggest
going right there.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:21.330
There's piles of
handwritten case records

01:08:21.332 --> 01:08:23.499
that have never been entered.

01:08:23.501 --> 01:08:25.768
I wouldn't know where
to begin to look.

01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:27.502
Oh, I can help you with that.

01:08:27.505 --> 01:08:29.238
Brenda, I wanted to let you know

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.406
how wonderful it
is that you have

01:08:30.408 --> 01:08:32.707
been of such great assistance.

01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:36.178
I'll call Blythe Bowlby,
and I'll set everything up.

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:37.645
John can accompany you.

01:08:37.648 --> 01:08:39.448
He is familiar with
the data interface,

01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:41.149
and he'll know
who to speak with.

01:08:41.152 --> 01:08:42.685
Great.

01:08:42.687 --> 01:08:45.554
And thank you very
much for the gift, ram.

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:47.256
You're very welcome.

01:08:47.258 --> 01:08:48.858
It says it all, doesn't it?

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:50.626
Predocs work so many
hours in the day

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.127
that we're always pooped.

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:01.604
So what kind of
music you into, man?

01:09:01.606 --> 01:09:03.872
I really don't know how
that is of importance.

01:09:03.875 --> 01:09:05.374
It can be.

01:09:05.376 --> 01:09:06.876
Depending.

01:09:06.877 --> 01:09:08.544
Depending on?

01:09:08.546 --> 01:09:10.479
Well, when I slam
through coding,

01:09:10.481 --> 01:09:14.517
listening to grizzly bear helps.

01:09:14.519 --> 01:09:15.885
But that's an exception.

01:09:15.886 --> 01:09:18.187
I don't like lame-stream.

01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:19.755
Fascinating.

01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:22.691
Or when I'm clubbing, MC
boy, "transmission of love."

01:09:22.693 --> 01:09:25.928
I like something more intense.

01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:28.596
These groups don't play
at the clubs near campus.

01:09:28.599 --> 01:09:28.596
Not here.

01:09:28.599 --> 01:09:31.267
At hung lo's, on the west-side.

01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:34.870
Never heard of it.

01:09:34.872 --> 01:09:37.406
You should check
it out some time.

01:09:37.408 --> 01:09:40.341
If you're into guys.

01:09:40.344 --> 01:09:41.743
What?

01:09:41.746 --> 01:09:44.380
What would make you say
something like that to me?

01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:46.182
Hung lo's, it's
a gay club I like.

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:51.353
Oh.

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:53.322
I'm so happy.

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:55.558
I thought you were talking
about that Chinese restaurant,

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.759
hung Lao's.

01:09:56.761 --> 01:09:57.693
No.

01:09:57.695 --> 01:09:59.762
No, hung lo.

01:09:59.764 --> 01:10:01.964
It's a place to get
down and let loose.

01:10:02.667 --> 01:10:02.665
Get loose.

01:10:02.667 --> 01:10:06.302
Would you like to hear a
song I'm thinking in my head?

01:10:07.538 --> 01:10:08.604
She's not your girlfriend.

01:10:08.606 --> 01:10:09.672
She's not your girlfriend.

01:10:09.674 --> 01:10:10.439
It's okay, man.

01:10:10.441 --> 01:10:12.508
Relax.

01:10:17.647 --> 01:10:18.948
Gentlemen, please come this way.

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:35.231
That's mine.

01:10:35.233 --> 01:10:35.898
That's mine.

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.900
It's mine.

01:10:39.604 --> 01:10:40.369
Thank you.

01:10:40.371 --> 01:10:40.869
No problem.

01:10:40.871 --> 01:10:42.938
Thank you.

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:47.876
Gentlemen.

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:54.650
You see that row
of records here?

01:10:54.652 --> 01:10:58.020
Our people went through them in
preparation for digitization.

01:10:58.022 --> 01:11:02.491
We did not find any records of
what happened to Nina Orleans.

01:11:02.493 --> 01:11:04.593
Nothing.

01:11:04.595 --> 01:11:06.829
What was most
likely her outcome?

01:11:06.831 --> 01:11:08.764
Most likely, she
wasn't discharged.

01:11:08.766 --> 01:11:11.300
That rarely has happened.

01:11:11.302 --> 01:11:13.669
She probably passed on.

01:11:13.671 --> 01:11:15.938
She was pretty bad off.

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:19.675
Someone in her condition
doesn't have a long life.

01:11:19.677 --> 01:11:22.778
I'm sorry I couldn't have more
definitive news or happier news

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:25.814
for that matter.

01:11:25.816 --> 01:11:27.850
It's okay.

01:11:27.852 --> 01:11:29.785
Thank you for your
generous time.

01:11:29.787 --> 01:11:31.587
Anything to help Brenda's group.

01:11:31.589 --> 01:11:34.356
Her modernization of the
state's health services system

01:11:34.358 --> 01:11:35.991
is most appreciated.

01:11:35.993 --> 01:11:38.494
Some people were here for
years, and no one even

01:11:38.496 --> 01:11:39.561
knew who they were.

01:11:46.603 --> 01:11:48.370
You lose your mind.

01:11:48.372 --> 01:11:49.605
They lose your identity.

01:11:49.607 --> 01:11:51.540
This suck... oh, sorry, dude.

01:11:51.542 --> 01:11:52.007
It's okay.

01:11:52.009 --> 01:11:53.342
It's okay.

01:11:53.344 --> 01:11:55.711
She might be with
the lost souls.

01:11:55.713 --> 01:11:57.613
What's that, my friend?

01:11:57.615 --> 01:12:01.483
She might be with
the lost souls.

01:12:01.485 --> 01:12:02.485
Well put.

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:09.325
Downstairs, in
the library of ash.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:17.366
It used to be, when someone
died here at teargarden,

01:12:17.368 --> 01:12:21.637
sometimes there was
no one to claim them.

01:12:21.639 --> 01:12:24.740
They were cremated.

01:12:24.742 --> 01:12:28.043
And their remains
were stored here.

01:12:28.045 --> 01:12:31.413
Those are the lost souls.

01:12:31.415 --> 01:12:34.450
In the cans.

01:12:34.452 --> 01:12:35.732
They call it the library of ash.

01:12:40.924 --> 01:12:45.461
This is extraordinarily
generous, Clayton.

01:12:45.463 --> 01:12:46.061
I don't understand.

01:12:46.063 --> 01:12:47.363
How is this possible?

01:12:47.365 --> 01:12:49.131
There's a sword
of Damocles hanging

01:12:49.133 --> 01:12:52.601
over the entire
pharmaceutical industry.

01:12:52.603 --> 01:12:53.902
It's being kept quiet.

01:12:53.904 --> 01:12:57.106
But the therapeutic
power of drugs

01:12:57.108 --> 01:13:01.377
has been steadily waning
for several years now.

01:13:01.379 --> 01:13:04.380
We're losing the battle
to help the mind, William.

01:13:04.382 --> 01:13:06.749
There's a worldwide scramble
for the next psychoactive.

01:13:06.751 --> 01:13:10.753
Yes, but how does this
tie into Jack's research.

01:13:10.755 --> 01:13:15.991
He may have stumbled onto a
gateway to a major advancement.

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:20.796
Please, sit, Dr. sutree.

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:29.405
You and I are
alike in some ways.

01:13:29.407 --> 01:13:33.509
We both started with a childhood
fascination with the sciences.

01:13:33.511 --> 01:13:35.577
It came from observing
the things in life

01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:37.980
that are full of whimsy.

01:13:37.982 --> 01:13:42.618
It's very seductive,
especially to a young mind.

01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:46.155
And you and I, unlike
the average Joe,

01:13:46.157 --> 01:13:49.458
we took things a step further.

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:54.196
We observed the whimsical, but
we backed it up with facts.

01:13:54.198 --> 01:13:56.799
That's what science is.

01:13:56.801 --> 01:14:00.636
So here's where we are.

01:14:00.638 --> 01:14:02.638
I've secured all the
funding you'll ever

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.208
need to continue your research.

01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:09.578
You'll have the time and
the supplies required.

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.814
What's he mean, Billy?

01:14:11.816 --> 01:14:12.816
It's right here, Jack.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.085
It's the largest
amount ever granted

01:14:17.087 --> 01:14:18.454
in the history of
this department.

01:14:22.892 --> 01:14:26.528
But because of the,
let's say, mercurial

01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:31.767
behavior that's been reported,
there are conditions.

01:14:31.769 --> 01:14:33.135
Ah.

01:14:33.137 --> 01:14:35.204
Conditions.

01:14:35.206 --> 01:14:37.773
Does it matter?

01:14:37.775 --> 01:14:40.576
You practically have carte
Blanche to finally understand

01:14:40.578 --> 01:14:42.578
what you discovered.

01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:44.680
But where does this lead?

01:14:44.682 --> 01:14:47.182
What's the end result, redfield?

01:14:47.184 --> 01:14:49.551
Everything will be
under your direction.

01:14:49.553 --> 01:14:50.853
You will receive full credit.

01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:56.492
Who owns the polio vaccine?

01:14:56.494 --> 01:14:57.793
What?

01:14:57.795 --> 01:15:00.028
The polio vaccine...
who owns the patent?

01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:01.797
No one.

01:15:01.799 --> 01:15:03.532
It wasn't for filling
the coffers of some giant

01:15:03.534 --> 01:15:04.533
multinational.

01:15:04.535 --> 01:15:06.235
It was given to the world.

01:15:06.237 --> 01:15:07.803
And it made the
world a better place.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:14.009
You know, for such a brilliant
man, you can be very naive.

01:15:14.011 --> 01:15:16.512
That's occurred because
it was determined

01:15:16.514 --> 01:15:19.014
that the national foundation
for infantile paralysis

01:15:19.016 --> 01:15:22.017
could not obtain a patent.

01:15:22.019 --> 01:15:25.153
The real irony is that
Jonas Salk's discovery

01:15:25.155 --> 01:15:29.591
would have benefited man even
more if it had been patented.

01:15:29.593 --> 01:15:33.028
Why does every discovery have
to be motivated by a cash grab?

01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:34.596
Jonathan swift said it best.

01:15:34.598 --> 01:15:35.631
Money is useful.

01:15:35.633 --> 01:15:39.001
Love of it, hazardous.

01:15:39.003 --> 01:15:40.903
There's nothing new here, Jack.

01:15:40.905 --> 01:15:42.738
You know this is
the way it works.

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:47.543
Your hero, swift... you know
he had Meniere's disease.

01:15:47.545 --> 01:15:50.646
Untreatable in his day.

01:15:50.648 --> 01:15:52.714
Now we have Meclizine
and Diazepam

01:15:52.716 --> 01:15:54.116
to help people cope with it.

01:15:54.118 --> 01:15:58.020
There's no denying drugs
have benefited mankind.

01:15:58.022 --> 01:16:01.890
But I've been in the trenches
of your broad marketplace,

01:16:01.892 --> 01:16:05.127
the nursing homes where your
miracle drugs are administered.

01:16:05.129 --> 01:16:06.862
You know what?

01:16:06.864 --> 01:16:08.597
It's not working out too well.

01:16:08.599 --> 01:16:11.333
We have zombies lying
in hospital beds.

01:16:11.335 --> 01:16:13.702
Basic cable their caregiver.

01:16:13.704 --> 01:16:15.938
Those poor people.

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:19.875
Desires that have been neutered.

01:16:19.877 --> 01:16:22.210
The system has become a
legitimized Pablo Escobar,

01:16:22.212 --> 01:16:25.647
and you unflinchingly supply
them, because it's big money.

01:16:25.649 --> 01:16:29.952
You've replaced cups of
hot tea and warm kisses

01:16:29.954 --> 01:16:32.254
with millions of plastic
pill organizers demanding

01:16:32.256 --> 01:16:32.254
to be filled.

01:16:32.256 --> 01:16:35.257
What really caused
the great social shift

01:16:35.259 --> 01:16:35.257
that we have witnessed?

01:16:35.259 --> 01:16:39.661
It's time the windfalls were
more human and less financial.

01:16:39.663 --> 01:16:40.929
Don't avoid the question.

01:16:40.931 --> 01:16:44.366
Who put all the
people in the homes?

01:16:44.368 --> 01:16:46.234
The families.

01:16:46.236 --> 01:16:52.975
Brothers, sisters, aunts,
uncles, and the children.

01:16:52.977 --> 01:16:55.377
They are the reason
for the avalanche

01:16:55.379 --> 01:17:00.849
that has uncontrollably spilled
into countless rest homes.

01:17:00.851 --> 01:17:02.284
But you will never
in a million years

01:17:02.286 --> 01:17:04.820
find an individual
snowflake ever

01:17:04.822 --> 01:17:08.657
taking responsibility for
their part in that avalanche.

01:17:12.762 --> 01:17:15.697
You have a mother in a
nursing home, don't you?

01:17:18.735 --> 01:17:22.638
Can't go crying to your
mommy about this letdown.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:28.744
You, Dr. sutree, are one
sorry, sanctimonious snowflake.

01:17:28.746 --> 01:17:30.345
Jack, don't!

01:17:30.347 --> 01:17:32.381
Don't, Jack!

01:17:32.383 --> 01:17:34.950
You, sir, have just assaulted
a university board member.

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:45.827
Your boy.

01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:11.853
Hi, Mel.

01:18:11.855 --> 01:18:15.223
My car just stranded me about
a half mile from our place.

01:18:15.225 --> 01:18:17.159
I know we agreed to
our separate spaces,

01:18:17.161 --> 01:18:19.327
but I got to stop by and get
something out of the garage.

01:18:19.329 --> 01:18:21.129
I promise I'll leave
as soon as I'm done.

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:03.905
[Music - Marie Baraton
and Pierre Andre Athane,

01:19:03.907 --> 01:19:09.010
["a Paris Les jours sans"]

01:19:38.074 --> 01:19:40.075
I'm done, Mel.

01:19:40.077 --> 01:19:43.011
I've lost everything.

01:19:43.013 --> 01:19:44.379
What?

01:19:44.381 --> 01:19:47.082
Maybe the job.

01:19:47.084 --> 01:19:48.183
The discovery.

01:19:48.185 --> 01:19:50.252
My colleagues.

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:57.893
I remember when I
visited notre dame.

01:19:57.895 --> 01:19:59.861
We had the sight of the
cathedral on our right.

01:19:59.863 --> 01:20:02.497
And on the left, we
crossed a bridge.

01:20:02.499 --> 01:20:05.233
And we ended up on
the ILE Saint-Louis.

01:20:05.235 --> 01:20:06.802
And further down
on the left, you

01:20:06.804 --> 01:20:09.805
took me to the best
crepe shop I have ever

01:20:09.807 --> 01:20:11.540
been to, filled with locals.

01:20:15.945 --> 01:20:20.949
Neither one of us knew anything
about where to eat in Paris.

01:20:20.951 --> 01:20:23.585
But you had a sense, Jack.

01:20:23.587 --> 01:20:27.923
You had a natural
instinct about things.

01:20:27.925 --> 01:20:31.059
I don't know, you followed
the sense in the air

01:20:31.061 --> 01:20:33.428
and tracked the
movements of the locals.

01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:36.031
You observed the looks on
the faces of the people

01:20:36.033 --> 01:20:37.899
exiting the bistros.

01:20:37.901 --> 01:20:41.536
And you processed all
of that to discover

01:20:41.538 --> 01:20:44.339
exactly the right
places for us to go to.

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:49.444
Who wouldn't fall in
love with a scientist who

01:20:49.446 --> 01:20:52.347
could muster his
abilities to provide

01:20:52.349 --> 01:20:53.509
his woman with a decent meal?

01:20:57.954 --> 01:20:59.020
Who wouldn't fall in love?

01:21:50.306 --> 01:21:52.374
Thanks.

01:21:56.212 --> 01:21:58.380
Still there.

01:21:58.382 --> 01:22:01.549
My other charger's in the Alfa.

01:22:01.551 --> 01:22:03.451
Your Alfa Naufrago.

01:22:03.453 --> 01:22:06.054
You finally ready to get
rid of that hunk of metal?

01:22:06.056 --> 01:22:07.222
Hey.

01:22:07.224 --> 01:22:09.691
I always like things
that look good.

01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:17.465
Any relapses from the other day?

01:22:17.467 --> 01:22:18.467
It's under control.

01:22:23.973 --> 01:22:26.374
You saw the dresser.

01:22:26.376 --> 01:22:30.045
You're not crawling the walls.

01:22:30.047 --> 01:22:31.646
There's hope for mankind yet.

01:22:31.648 --> 01:22:33.281
If we're lucky.

01:23:43.652 --> 01:23:45.553
Forget the rumors.

01:23:45.555 --> 01:23:47.155
We are not ceasing
operation of this lab.

01:23:48.658 --> 01:23:50.692
The department feels that,
even with Dr. Sutree's absence,

01:23:50.694 --> 01:23:54.095
the importance of the work
demands that we continue.

01:23:54.097 --> 01:23:57.098
The last thing any of us want
is for the research community

01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:00.702
to perceive that we
have dropped the ball.

01:24:00.704 --> 01:24:03.204
Ram, call me when you hear this.

01:24:03.206 --> 01:24:04.339
I'll be visiting my mother.

01:24:04.341 --> 01:24:05.807
Thanks.

01:24:05.809 --> 01:24:08.410
What's that on the
board over there?

01:24:08.412 --> 01:24:10.111
Ram.

01:24:10.113 --> 01:24:11.613
We formalized
what Dr, sutree was

01:24:11.615 --> 01:24:14.482
doing at the time
of the lab accident.

01:24:14.484 --> 01:24:17.519
This formula is for a gaseous
substance that he created.

01:24:17.521 --> 01:24:20.155
Once it distilled, it
cooled into a liquid.

01:24:20.157 --> 01:24:23.825
Was the liquid used to coat
special lenses or something

01:24:23.827 --> 01:24:23.825
like that?

01:24:23.827 --> 01:24:28.096
Dr. sutree applied the
liquid directly into his eyes.

01:24:28.098 --> 01:24:31.666
Where's this liquid now?

01:24:31.668 --> 01:24:32.834
It's gone.

01:24:32.836 --> 01:24:34.436
It used to be in the cabinet.

01:24:38.374 --> 01:24:40.275
Any idea who might
have taken it?

01:24:40.277 --> 01:24:43.778
We know it wasn't Dr. sutree,
because the door is open.

01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:45.413
I don't follow.

01:24:45.415 --> 01:24:48.316
He can't stand anything
left open... doors, drawers,

01:24:48.318 --> 01:24:50.485
or anything out of its place.

01:24:50.487 --> 01:24:52.720
This is a backup
pair of the goggle

01:24:52.722 --> 01:24:55.223
we developed as a delivery
mechanism for the liquid.

01:24:55.225 --> 01:24:59.427
They're used to apply small
dosage directly onto the eyes.

01:24:59.429 --> 01:25:00.762
How long before it takes effect?

01:25:00.764 --> 01:25:03.131
Within an hour.

01:25:03.133 --> 01:25:04.666
Here's what I want
the both of you to do.

01:25:04.668 --> 01:25:07.302
Immediately create a
new batch of liquid.

01:25:07.304 --> 01:25:10.405
Follow the formula and
procedures exactly.

01:25:10.407 --> 01:25:13.475
I take it you have all
the necessary supplies.

01:25:13.477 --> 01:25:15.143
Actually, it's ready to go.

01:25:15.145 --> 01:25:16.611
Then we'll have
something by day's end.

01:25:16.613 --> 01:25:17.679
Agreed?

01:25:17.681 --> 01:25:19.681
Okay.

01:25:19.683 --> 01:25:23.251
If you need help or anything
else, just ring me up.

01:25:23.253 --> 01:25:25.220
Sabahu Al-khayer.

01:25:25.222 --> 01:25:27.455
Alaikum wa salam.

01:25:27.457 --> 01:25:28.857
Mr. Tambel.

01:25:28.859 --> 01:25:30.358
Could I have a word
with you, please?

01:25:33.162 --> 01:25:36.164
I understand you and Dr.
sutree had a close working

01:25:36.166 --> 01:25:37.365
relationship.

01:25:37.367 --> 01:25:38.333
I guess so.

01:25:38.335 --> 01:25:40.602
He's been very supportive.

01:25:40.604 --> 01:25:43.204
You're near the completion
of your doctorate.

01:25:43.206 --> 01:25:44.873
I want you to know
there is no reason

01:25:44.875 --> 01:25:47.275
to be concerned with
any interruptions that

01:25:47.277 --> 01:25:48.743
might impede your goal.

01:25:48.745 --> 01:25:51.346
You have the full support
of this department.

01:25:51.348 --> 01:25:54.249
That is very much appreciated.

01:25:54.251 --> 01:25:59.154
So the department can depend
on a 100% commitment from you.

01:25:59.156 --> 01:26:02.290
105%.

01:26:02.292 --> 01:26:04.359
Good day, Mr. Tambel.

01:26:04.361 --> 01:26:05.361
Keep up the good work.

01:26:12.301 --> 01:26:14.502
What did he want?

01:26:14.504 --> 01:26:18.173
Directions to Nambla.

01:26:50.941 --> 01:26:52.574
Mr. sutree?

01:26:52.576 --> 01:26:53.274
Morning.

01:26:53.276 --> 01:26:55.543
Where is she?

01:26:55.545 --> 01:26:57.879
We left so many messages.

01:26:57.881 --> 01:26:58.881
I'm so sorry.

01:27:19.668 --> 01:27:21.803
When?

01:27:21.805 --> 01:27:24.305
She was extremely
nauseated and experiencing

01:27:24.307 --> 01:27:27.008
a great deal of pain the
day before yesterday.

01:27:27.010 --> 01:27:29.978
Her feet and ankles
were swollen.

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:33.948
Dr. Walters here rushed
her to the hospital.

01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:35.617
It was her chronic infection.

01:27:35.619 --> 01:27:40.588
It finally shut down her
kidneys, and that was it.

01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:45.293
If it means anything, your
mother was so proud of you.

01:27:48.998 --> 01:27:53.434
She told me she was blessed
to have a son who worked hard,

01:27:53.436 --> 01:27:57.672
who was honest, who looked
for ways to help people.

01:28:05.483 --> 01:28:06.382
What is this?

01:28:06.383 --> 01:28:09.884
It's time to do something
about the 50-ton elephant

01:28:09.886 --> 01:28:09.884
in the room.

01:28:09.886 --> 01:28:14.856
Sutree has suffered
a major breakdown.

01:28:14.858 --> 01:28:18.426
This is bellicose,
even for you, Clayton.

01:28:18.428 --> 01:28:20.728
I've never heard of this
happening to a faculty member.

01:28:20.730 --> 01:28:22.897
We live in bellicose
times, William.

01:28:22.899 --> 01:28:28.436
Whenever something is amiss,
you need to take action fast.

01:28:28.438 --> 01:28:31.606
Yes, but this sets a
serious procedure in motion.

01:28:31.608 --> 01:28:34.342
A psychiatric ward?

01:28:34.344 --> 01:28:35.610
Dr. Doodnaugh agrees.

01:28:35.612 --> 01:28:37.945
This is a serious matter.

01:28:37.947 --> 01:28:41.916
Azro, don't you think this
is an overly aggressive move?

01:28:41.918 --> 01:28:44.652
Based on the video that
Clayton shared with us

01:28:44.654 --> 01:28:47.655
and the depositions
of the witnesses,

01:28:47.657 --> 01:28:49.757
this is indeed a serious matter.

01:28:49.759 --> 01:28:52.660
This man appears to be a
danger to himself and to people

01:28:52.662 --> 01:28:53.428
around him.

01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:54.629
Depositions?

01:28:54.631 --> 01:28:56.798
Depositions are
already in place?

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.533
There's too much
potential on the table

01:28:58.535 --> 01:29:00.368
to hesitate one second.

01:29:00.370 --> 01:29:01.669
Where does this leave Jack?

01:29:01.671 --> 01:29:04.005
He'll have some of the
best care available.

01:29:04.007 --> 01:29:06.341
The most important
thing is this procedure

01:29:06.343 --> 01:29:09.777
protects the university's
interests in the authorship

01:29:09.779 --> 01:29:10.845
of the research.

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:27.462
Jack?

01:29:27.464 --> 01:29:28.663
You're freaking me out.

01:29:28.665 --> 01:29:30.565
You're here in my chapel?

01:29:30.567 --> 01:29:31.807
It was my mom's favorite place.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:36.003
Oh.

01:29:36.005 --> 01:29:37.372
My friend, I'm so sorry.

01:29:39.975 --> 01:29:41.442
Dear, departed one.

01:29:41.444 --> 01:29:44.545
Requiescat in pace.

01:29:44.547 --> 01:29:46.080
Please, come this way.

01:29:46.082 --> 01:29:47.715
You shouldn't be
standing here alone.

01:29:47.717 --> 01:29:48.616
It's okay.

01:29:48.618 --> 01:29:50.084
I'm good.

01:29:50.086 --> 01:29:52.453
Plus, I asked my research
assistant to meet me here.

01:29:52.455 --> 01:29:53.755
So I should stay inside.

01:29:53.757 --> 01:29:56.424
Listen, something's happened.

01:29:56.426 --> 01:30:02.597
Maybe a breakthrough in this
thing I'm struggling with.

01:30:02.599 --> 01:30:04.065
Ram, good.

01:30:04.067 --> 01:30:06.033
Your mechanic said this
replacement part should work.

01:30:06.035 --> 01:30:06.033
Thanks.

01:30:06.035 --> 01:30:08.035
Do you know reverend halloway?

01:30:08.037 --> 01:30:08.703
I do now.

01:30:08.705 --> 01:30:09.404
Namaste.

01:30:09.406 --> 01:30:10.972
Namaste.

01:30:10.974 --> 01:30:12.054
Follow my thinking, Stuart.

01:30:17.713 --> 01:30:22.583
Consider your reflection
in the mirror or the sight

01:30:22.585 --> 01:30:24.619
of a rainbow in the sky.

01:30:24.621 --> 01:30:26.087
Neither is really there.

01:30:26.089 --> 01:30:29.424
But the image is projected
on the back of your retina.

01:30:29.426 --> 01:30:31.726
You can take a picture
of them with a camera.

01:30:31.728 --> 01:30:34.762
But the things I'm seeing
cannot be photographed.

01:30:34.764 --> 01:30:39.167
They only exist
here, in my head.

01:30:39.169 --> 01:30:41.436
Why in your head?

01:30:49.912 --> 01:30:51.813
Remember the onion
you talked about?

01:30:55.083 --> 01:30:57.084
What defines why we see it?

01:31:00.589 --> 01:31:02.490
Waves.

01:31:02.492 --> 01:31:03.758
Light waves.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.026
Waves from all
sorts of directions.

01:31:05.028 --> 01:31:07.762
Where they interfere
defines that onion.

01:31:07.764 --> 01:31:13.901
You show me it's cosmic
and intimate, all at once.

01:31:13.903 --> 01:31:17.705
A beautiful, mysterious
thing full of query.

01:31:17.707 --> 01:31:20.208
Light waves are a form
of visible energy.

01:31:20.210 --> 01:31:22.210
Somehow, through
the lab accident,

01:31:22.212 --> 01:31:27.215
I've become sensitive to other
forms of invisible energy.

01:31:27.217 --> 01:31:31.652
You're saying you can see
the very energy of life?

01:31:31.654 --> 01:31:33.521
Jack, may I?

01:31:33.523 --> 01:31:35.957
When you saw sunny-girl,
what did you see?

01:31:35.959 --> 01:31:37.258
She was happy.

01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:39.527
Very happy, the
way she always was.

01:31:39.529 --> 01:31:40.795
That's her essence, Jack.

01:31:40.797 --> 01:31:42.663
You were seeing her
essence... the energy

01:31:42.665 --> 01:31:45.566
of the essence of what she was.

01:31:45.568 --> 01:31:47.835
Reverend halloway, Jack has
this very special connection

01:31:47.837 --> 01:31:49.570
with one subject we met.

01:31:49.572 --> 01:31:51.005
He had one test
session with her.

01:31:51.007 --> 01:31:53.808
A homeless musician, bazemint.

01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:56.210
When we first met, I had
an unusually strong vision

01:31:56.212 --> 01:31:58.179
with her unlike all the others.

01:31:58.181 --> 01:32:01.849
During the session, she
touched my shoulder.

01:32:01.851 --> 01:32:03.985
That's when I saw even
more than her essence,

01:32:03.987 --> 01:32:05.520
if that's what we're calling it.

01:32:05.522 --> 01:32:07.402
I started seeing things
that affect her essence.

01:32:09.958 --> 01:32:13.861
Our senses are the
gateway to our mind.

01:32:13.863 --> 01:32:17.198
Perhaps now, the
gateway to the soul.

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.534
Is a final theory
of consciousness

01:32:19.536 --> 01:32:26.641
at hand, a way to translate and
study the meta-data of the soul?

01:32:26.643 --> 01:32:28.676
The girl you were
studying... when will you

01:32:28.678 --> 01:32:29.644
work with her again?

01:32:29.646 --> 01:32:31.546
It's not possible now.

01:32:31.548 --> 01:32:33.080
Dr. redfield has
taken over the lab.

01:32:33.082 --> 01:32:33.080
With everything that's happened,

01:32:33.082 --> 01:32:37.985
it's imperative that you come
up with solid substantiation,

01:32:37.987 --> 01:32:40.555
indisputable proof,
of what you have.

01:32:40.557 --> 01:32:43.958
Or you're going to be gorged
by a pack of hungry wolves.

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:43.958
How bad is it at the lab?

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:47.662
I can't get in without
Medina or redfield.

01:32:47.664 --> 01:32:48.729
No, I have to get in somehow.

01:32:48.731 --> 01:32:50.665
I need to retrieve the flask.

01:32:50.667 --> 01:32:52.967
But it's missing
from the cabinet.

01:32:52.969 --> 01:32:55.236
Oh, I didn't leave
it in the cabinet.

01:32:55.238 --> 01:32:57.204
Dr. sutree, huzzah!

01:32:57.206 --> 01:32:58.806
Go pick up bazemint.

01:32:58.808 --> 01:33:00.274
I'm going to drop the
starter in my car.

01:33:00.276 --> 01:33:01.943
Stuart, can you
get us into a lab?

01:33:01.945 --> 01:33:03.878
Ram can let you know the
specifics on the monitoring

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:04.779
equipment.

01:33:04.781 --> 01:33:05.813
I'll make some calls.

01:33:05.815 --> 01:33:07.081
Let me know when you're ready.

01:33:07.083 --> 01:33:09.150
Great.

01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:17.291
Like... like this?

01:33:17.293 --> 01:33:19.360
Yes.

01:33:22.898 --> 01:33:24.899
Now we wait.

01:33:24.901 --> 01:33:27.301
Did you want to go through any
of the analyzes on the drives?

01:33:27.303 --> 01:33:29.370
We have them.

01:33:29.372 --> 01:33:31.906
Were there any handwritten
materials generated?

01:33:31.908 --> 01:33:32.974
Those are filed back here.

01:33:43.287 --> 01:33:44.186
You find her?

01:33:44.187 --> 01:33:44.185
Problem, Jack.

01:33:44.187 --> 01:33:47.922
I gave bazemint the
news about her mother.

01:33:47.924 --> 01:33:48.990
What do you mean?

01:33:48.992 --> 01:33:48.990
She's a bit upset.

01:33:48.992 --> 01:33:53.160
I think you need to come here
and speak with her in person.

01:33:53.162 --> 01:33:53.160
All right.

01:33:53.162 --> 01:33:54.629
Shoot me your location.

01:33:54.631 --> 01:33:56.697
On my way.

01:34:06.341 --> 01:34:08.809
Bazemint, I'm really sorry
about the news of your mom.

01:34:08.811 --> 01:34:11.178
But you agree, it's better that
you know what happened, right?

01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:12.079
It's not the news.

01:34:12.081 --> 01:34:12.079
It's the respect.

01:34:12.081 --> 01:34:15.650
My mama never got no respect,
not even when she died.

01:34:15.652 --> 01:34:16.350
I don't understand.

01:34:16.352 --> 01:34:16.350
You weren't there.

01:34:16.352 --> 01:34:18.953
How would you know
she was disrespected?

01:34:18.955 --> 01:34:19.820
Not then.

01:34:19.822 --> 01:34:21.422
Now.

01:34:21.424 --> 01:34:24.425
That woman's ashes are sitting
on a punk-ass shelf in a closet

01:34:24.427 --> 01:34:26.794
in a goddamn closet.

01:34:26.796 --> 01:34:28.763
That's no way to leave a person.

01:34:28.765 --> 01:34:30.398
My mama needs to be respected.

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.800
She needs to be buried.

01:34:32.802 --> 01:34:34.902
Ram, will they allow that?

01:34:34.904 --> 01:34:36.337
It's going to be
difficult, Jack.

01:34:36.339 --> 01:34:37.972
None of the canisters are ided.

01:34:37.974 --> 01:34:39.407
They're all grouped by date.

01:34:39.409 --> 01:34:41.175
It's a lack of records.

01:34:41.177 --> 01:34:42.977
Bazemint, what if I
petition the institute

01:34:42.979 --> 01:34:44.045
to bury all the canisters?

01:34:44.047 --> 01:34:45.713
Would that be okay with you?

01:34:45.715 --> 01:34:46.814
She needs her own space.

01:34:46.816 --> 01:34:48.382
She needs her own respect.

01:34:48.384 --> 01:34:49.984
She weren't perfect.

01:34:49.986 --> 01:34:51.218
I know that.

01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:54.789
But my mama should
have her final respect.

01:34:54.791 --> 01:34:56.857
It's tough, Jack.

01:34:56.859 --> 01:35:00.828
There are hundreds of cans.

01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:03.230
No, there's a way.

01:35:03.232 --> 01:35:06.067
Bazemint, I promise
you, I will find which

01:35:06.069 --> 01:35:07.868
canister has your mom's ashes.

01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:09.170
How can you do that?

01:35:09.172 --> 01:35:11.706
I'm asking you to
trust me on this.

01:35:11.708 --> 01:35:13.774
Okay.

01:35:14.910 --> 01:35:17.745
How you gonna do that?

01:35:17.747 --> 01:35:19.113
Don't forget.

01:35:19.115 --> 01:35:20.115
We got Al-Gore-rhythms.

01:36:40.428 --> 01:36:41.996
Just me, Clay.

01:36:41.998 --> 01:36:42.897
Bleu?

01:36:42.899 --> 01:36:44.465
You're still here?

01:36:44.467 --> 01:36:47.101
Yeah, I was coming to bring
you the signed hospitalization

01:36:47.103 --> 01:36:48.002
form.

01:36:48.004 --> 01:36:48.002
But wouldn't you know?

01:36:48.004 --> 01:36:49.370
It's in the other bag.

01:36:54.376 --> 01:36:56.877
I double-checked the formula
and the methodologies.

01:36:56.879 --> 01:37:00.481
We followed everything exactly.

01:37:00.483 --> 01:37:04.285
Well, nothing happened.

01:37:04.287 --> 01:37:09.456
It appears this phenomenon
is specific going to sutree.

01:37:09.458 --> 01:37:11.959
I fear he holds some
missing information.

01:37:16.898 --> 01:37:19.266
Yes?

01:37:19.268 --> 01:37:21.902
I see.

01:37:21.904 --> 01:37:26.273
Ms. Hamid, tell me what
business does Mr. Tambel have

01:37:26.275 --> 01:37:28.542
at the teargarden institute.

01:37:41.022 --> 01:37:43.591
So many visions
to psychoanalyze.

01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:53.300
The politician screaming
the bleedin' lies.

01:37:57.539 --> 01:38:01.609
You burn down the highway,
leaving no place to run.

01:38:04.646 --> 01:38:07.348
Hey, shake, babe.

01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:12.286
Shake off your demon
and watch that angel go.

01:38:34.342 --> 01:38:36.410
This is going to take a while.

01:38:39.247 --> 01:38:41.382
We'll find her.

01:38:41.384 --> 01:38:42.384
Ready, Jack.

01:38:48.657 --> 01:38:50.024
Come out.

01:38:50.026 --> 01:38:52.092
All of you, please.

01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:57.097
What's up with Mr. clean?

01:38:57.099 --> 01:38:58.699
This is Dr. redfield, bazemint.

01:38:58.701 --> 01:39:01.502
Do you both realize that
you are assisting a man who

01:39:01.504 --> 01:39:03.103
is in serious trouble?

01:39:03.105 --> 01:39:04.238
Careful, redfield.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.674
I assault board of
regents members.

01:39:07.411 --> 01:39:08.310
Redfield!

01:39:08.311 --> 01:39:10.177
Why did he lock the door?

01:39:10.179 --> 01:39:11.679
There's no way out!

01:39:11.681 --> 01:39:12.646
Redfield, please.

01:39:12.648 --> 01:39:14.281
You need supervision.

01:39:14.283 --> 01:39:15.516
Get the guard to open this door.

01:39:15.518 --> 01:39:16.518
Clayton!

01:39:17.453 --> 01:39:19.620
Redfield, please,
you need supervision.

01:39:22.091 --> 01:39:23.157
Redfield!

01:39:40.275 --> 01:39:41.308
We need to do further testing.

01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:42.310
Clayton, please.

01:39:45.347 --> 01:39:47.281
Clayton, listen to me.

01:39:47.283 --> 01:39:49.016
Do not use the goggles.

01:39:49.018 --> 01:39:50.018
There are side effects.

01:39:53.054 --> 01:39:54.054
Think, Clayton.

01:39:55.691 --> 01:39:57.057
Clayton!

01:39:57.059 --> 01:39:59.226
Do not use the goggles.

01:39:59.228 --> 01:40:00.627
We need to do more testing.

01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:03.030
There are side effects.

01:40:03.032 --> 01:40:04.365
Clayton, please.

01:40:04.367 --> 01:40:06.567
You gotta listen to me.

01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:09.070
Redfield...

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:12.039
oh.

01:40:12.041 --> 01:40:12.539
Oh.

01:40:12.541 --> 01:40:13.540
Back.

01:40:13.542 --> 01:40:14.542
Back.

01:40:16.512 --> 01:40:17.512
Stay back.

01:41:19.774 --> 01:41:20.774
Ma... mama?

01:41:26.381 --> 01:41:28.148
Oh, you're my mama.

01:41:28.150 --> 01:41:29.283
I know it.

01:41:38.761 --> 01:41:39.827
Clayton!

01:41:44.265 --> 01:41:46.500
Get one of the doctors, now.

01:41:46.502 --> 01:41:48.502
Get his buttons.

01:41:48.504 --> 01:41:49.736
Stay with us, Clayton.

01:41:54.343 --> 01:41:58.645
Are you... are you okay?

01:41:58.647 --> 01:42:02.549
What can I do for you?

01:42:02.551 --> 01:42:05.185
Oh, my child.

01:42:05.187 --> 01:42:05.786
Would you look at that?

01:42:05.788 --> 01:42:07.788
It is.

01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:10.457
Are you real?

01:42:10.459 --> 01:42:12.292
You better believe I'm real.

01:42:15.363 --> 01:42:17.431
Bee never moves without
being led by someone.

01:42:20.235 --> 01:42:21.702
Oh, mama.

01:42:21.704 --> 01:42:23.170
Oh, my child.

01:42:26.674 --> 01:42:29.143
Oh, my little child.

01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:40.754
What is that woman's name?

01:42:40.756 --> 01:42:42.456
She's patient 108.

01:42:42.458 --> 01:42:44.625
But everyone here calls her bee.

01:42:44.627 --> 01:42:44.625
Bee minor.

01:42:44.627 --> 01:42:47.661
She's only ever played
one song on that piano.

01:42:47.663 --> 01:42:49.396
Professor Jack.

01:42:49.398 --> 01:42:50.697
That's my mama, that's my mama.

01:42:50.699 --> 01:42:52.199
I knows it.

01:42:52.201 --> 01:42:53.300
Are you sure?

01:42:53.302 --> 01:42:54.902
I knows it in my bones.

01:42:54.904 --> 01:42:55.736
That's how sure I am.

01:42:55.738 --> 01:42:57.237
Okay.

01:42:57.239 --> 01:43:01.308
This patient's records
were lost years ago.

01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:04.912
Anything that you have that
can help us with her identity

01:43:04.914 --> 01:43:06.213
will be helpful.

01:43:06.215 --> 01:43:07.548
I'm from cu.

01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:09.750
Bazemint is working with
us on an important study.

01:43:09.752 --> 01:43:11.418
We can help confirm
this woman's identity.

01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:12.719
Just let us know what you need.

01:43:12.721 --> 01:43:15.522
Coming through.

01:43:15.524 --> 01:43:16.823
What happened to him?

01:43:16.825 --> 01:43:18.292
Too many drugs.

01:43:50.225 --> 01:43:51.225
Stand here, please.

01:43:57.233 --> 01:43:57.864
Okay, thank you.

01:43:57.866 --> 01:43:58.599
Stand there.

01:43:58.601 --> 01:44:00.000
Good.

01:44:00.002 --> 01:44:03.237
The test program seems
to have caught on.

01:44:03.239 --> 01:44:06.907
We can handle maybe
30 more candidates.

01:44:06.909 --> 01:44:09.676
Has Jack had any progress
on expanding the formula?

01:44:09.678 --> 01:44:09.676
Not yet.

01:44:09.678 --> 01:44:12.446
We haven't found a
substitute for what

01:44:12.448 --> 01:44:14.815
he calls the sunny-girl factor.

01:44:14.817 --> 01:44:15.817
Stay with it.

01:44:20.255 --> 01:44:21.255
May I?

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.522
Bazemint says you a mover.

01:44:55.524 --> 01:44:58.392
Talking about freeafying
the mind and shit.

01:44:58.394 --> 01:45:01.328
You're always
looking for something.

01:45:01.330 --> 01:45:03.864
Everyone is.

01:45:03.866 --> 01:45:07.834
But there's one thing you
really want... the truth.

01:45:10.738 --> 01:45:13.307
Man, who don't want the truth?

01:45:13.309 --> 01:45:14.875
It sure would make
things a lot easier

01:45:14.877 --> 01:45:16.877
rather than all the bullshit.

01:45:16.879 --> 01:45:21.548
The thing is you
already know the truth.

01:45:21.550 --> 01:45:23.850
You just never had the
opportunity to express it.

01:45:23.852 --> 01:45:26.820
Damn straight.

01:45:26.822 --> 01:45:30.357
It's time you try
another way to speak.

01:45:30.359 --> 01:45:31.959
Who's going to listen
to someone like me?

01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:37.270
Give this to the person
at the table out there.

01:45:46.507 --> 01:45:47.974
Hey.

01:45:47.976 --> 01:45:49.876
You, me.

01:45:49.878 --> 01:45:52.679
We get our grounding from
wherever we can find it.

01:45:52.681 --> 01:45:53.681
Good luck.

01:46:00.822 --> 01:46:03.056
This is the address of
the Williams art center.

01:46:03.058 --> 01:46:05.726
Tomorrow, they will be
expecting you at 10:00 am.

01:46:08.663 --> 01:46:10.097
Why?

01:46:10.099 --> 01:46:12.432
You'll begin your new class.

01:46:12.434 --> 01:46:14.000
Just show up.

01:46:14.002 --> 01:46:18.605
Everything else... supplies,
lunch... has been taken care of.

01:46:18.607 --> 01:46:21.141
What class?

01:46:21.143 --> 01:46:22.143
Canvas painting.

01:46:36.023 --> 01:46:37.758
The connection you
have with each person.

01:46:40.895 --> 01:46:42.629
Pretty intense.

01:46:42.631 --> 01:46:46.867
I saw a vet earlier today.

01:46:46.869 --> 01:46:49.836
He was a hostage in Iraq.

01:46:49.838 --> 01:46:52.706
He asked his captor
when he would be free.

01:46:52.708 --> 01:46:54.474
The captor, the
person in control,

01:46:54.476 --> 01:47:00.914
said, when you are
free, I will be free.

01:47:00.916 --> 01:47:03.517
The captor and the captive.

01:47:03.519 --> 01:47:05.018
The rich and the poor.

01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:08.121
The educated and the ignorant.

01:47:08.123 --> 01:47:09.956
Every minute, day,
and night, we're

01:47:09.958 --> 01:47:12.793
putting something out there.

01:47:12.795 --> 01:47:14.161
Naked truth.

01:47:14.163 --> 01:47:15.796
Hatred.

01:47:15.798 --> 01:47:17.030
Intense passion.

01:47:17.032 --> 01:47:18.031
Jealousy.

01:47:18.033 --> 01:47:18.732
Smarts.

01:47:18.734 --> 01:47:20.133
Dominance.

01:47:20.135 --> 01:47:22.436
Submissiveness.

01:47:22.438 --> 01:47:25.071
Indifference.

01:47:25.073 --> 01:47:27.107
Love.

01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:30.210
It's all that undying
energy Einstein described

01:47:30.212 --> 01:47:34.748
moving, clashing, merging.

01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:40.754
That's why we can
never escape the effect

01:47:40.756 --> 01:47:41.855
we have on each other.

01:47:47.562 --> 01:47:50.497
Give it a fly beat that
will dance down the street.

01:47:53.035 --> 01:47:53.800
Uh-huh.

01:47:53.802 --> 01:47:54.802
There you go.

01:47:59.074 --> 01:48:00.607
There you go.

01:48:03.978 --> 01:48:04.978
It's starting, Jack.

01:48:09.651 --> 01:48:11.151
Let's go.

01:48:24.832 --> 01:48:29.102
She wakes up early
every morning just to do her

01:48:29.104 --> 01:48:32.806
hair now, because
she cares, y'all.

01:48:32.808 --> 01:48:38.111
Her hair wouldn't be
right without her makeup.

01:48:38.113 --> 01:48:40.814
She's never out of makeup.

01:48:40.816 --> 01:48:43.583
She's just like you and me.

01:48:43.585 --> 01:48:46.086
But she's homeless.

01:48:46.088 --> 01:48:49.089
She's homeless.

01:48:49.091 --> 01:48:52.058
And she stands there
singing for money.

01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:54.060
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:48:54.062 --> 01:48:56.062
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:48:56.064 --> 01:48:58.064
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:48:58.066 --> 01:49:01.234
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:01.236 --> 01:49:05.005
In my sleep, I see her
begging, reaching, please.

01:49:09.243 --> 01:49:14.014
Although the problem's
not mine, I ask god, why?

01:49:14.016 --> 01:49:16.716
God, oh, why?

01:49:16.718 --> 01:49:19.719
She's just like you and me.

01:49:19.721 --> 01:49:22.022
But she's homeless.

01:49:22.024 --> 01:49:24.991
She's homeless.

01:49:24.993 --> 01:49:28.695
And she stands there
singing for money.

01:49:28.697 --> 01:49:29.996
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:29.998 --> 01:49:31.998
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:34.002 --> 01:49:35.969
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:35.971 --> 01:49:37.971
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:37.973 --> 01:49:39.673
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:39.675 --> 01:49:41.675
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:41.677 --> 01:49:43.677
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:43.679 --> 01:49:46.947
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da,
la-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:46.949 --> 01:49:48.949
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:48.951 --> 01:49:50.951
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:50.953 --> 01:49:52.953
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:52.955 --> 01:49:54.654
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:54.656 --> 01:49:56.222
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

01:49:56.224 --> 01:49:57.958
La-da-Dee.
