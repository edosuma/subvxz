00:02.911 --> 00:06.672
[Iron Man narrating] An alien named
the Beyonder took pieces of worlds,

00:06.749 --> 00:10.250
then mashed them together
to build Battleworld.

00:10.327 --> 00:12.063
[Captain America narrating] The people
from those places, including the Avengers,

00:12.087 --> 00:13.920
were brought to this world.

00:13.997 --> 00:15.997
The Beyonder calls this
his experiment.

00:16.075 --> 00:18.075
We call it twisted
and dangerous.

00:18.077 --> 00:21.762
With Loki on our side, we tried
to use the Asgardian Bifrost

00:21.838 --> 00:23.080
to send everyone home.

00:23.082 --> 00:24.414
It didn't work.

00:24.416 --> 00:28.418
The Beyonder retaliated
by splitting Hulk in two,

00:28.420 --> 00:29.580
then blasting them both away.

00:32.758 --> 00:35.034
Now Loki and I
are rebuilding a new Bifrost

00:35.110 --> 00:39.354
so we can undo Battleworld and
end the Beyonder's experiment.

00:39.431 --> 00:43.767
We have some parts. What we
need next is Heimdall's sword,

00:43.769 --> 00:45.235
the key to activating
the Bifrost.

00:45.237 --> 00:49.122
So Black Panther and Falcon
are in K'un-Lun to find it.

00:49.199 --> 00:51.550
No sign of cities or towns,
or anything at all.

00:51.627 --> 00:56.037
Keep looking, Falcon. According to
the coordinates Iron Man gave us...

00:56.115 --> 00:58.223
Falcon, dive! Now!
Dive? From what?

00:58.300 --> 01:00.133
[roaring]

01:00.210 --> 01:02.469
Never mind. I see it now.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.283
[weapons firing]

01:20.197 --> 01:22.939
Not gonna be able
to blast my way out of this one.

01:23.017 --> 01:26.518
But what goes up...
must come down.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.961
[roars] [thud]

01:28.038 --> 01:29.688
[birds screeching]

01:29.690 --> 01:33.283
[roaring]

01:33.360 --> 01:36.211
Falcon? Falcon, where are you?

01:38.290 --> 01:39.973
Hey, Black Panther, you know,

01:40.050 --> 01:42.884
you could've just warned me that
there was a dragon ahead of us.

01:42.961 --> 01:45.295
I did warn you. No.

01:45.372 --> 01:47.556
You just gave me
an order to dive.

01:47.632 --> 01:51.467
How about next time you say, "Look out,
dragon," and let me decide what to do?

01:51.545 --> 01:53.320
[sighs]

01:53.397 --> 01:57.473
Sometimes there is no time
for options or explanations.

01:57.551 --> 02:01.570
There would have been no danger if you
had followed my lead and trusted me.

02:01.646 --> 02:04.998
Do not forget, my young
friend, I am a king.

02:05.075 --> 02:09.651
Yeah, well, you're not my king. And
I'm not so young anymore either,

02:09.729 --> 02:11.490
so you can stop talking to me
like I'm a kid.

02:12.157 --> 02:13.157
Hmph!

02:16.237 --> 02:18.253
[Falcon] This must be the place.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.906
[villagers chattering]
[laughing]

02:20.908 --> 02:24.759
Weird. These people were taken
from Earth by the Beyonder,

02:24.836 --> 02:28.263
but they're just carrying on
like nothing's wrong.

02:28.340 --> 02:30.524
After Tony Stark
rebuilds the Bifrost,

02:30.601 --> 02:33.585
we can send these
K'un-Lun villagers back home.

02:33.587 --> 02:34.731
Once we find Heimdall's sword.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.105
Our intel says
the sword's in that castle.

02:39.927 --> 02:44.187
Excuse us. Hey. Hi.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.864
We need to get
inside the castle.

02:50.621 --> 02:53.363
[man] I... I don't believe
what I'm seeing.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.217
Iron Fist?
Black Panther and Falcon.

02:57.294 --> 03:00.462
It gratifies me to see
the faces of friends.

03:00.538 --> 03:02.797
The feeling is mutual.
What happened here?

03:02.874 --> 03:05.893
Shortly after K'un-Lun
was brought to Battleworld,

03:05.969 --> 03:09.730
a great evil swept into our land
and threatened the innocent.

03:09.806 --> 03:14.626
The warriors of K'un-Lun and I
fought back, but at great cost.

03:14.628 --> 03:18.054
Now... I stand alone.

03:18.132 --> 03:21.224
Not alone anymore. Now it's you,

03:21.302 --> 03:23.818
me, and Panther, plus the
Avengers back at the Tower.

03:23.895 --> 03:26.396
The other Avengers are safe too?

03:26.473 --> 03:31.585
I had begun to lose hope. But if we stand
together, perhaps we have a chance.

03:31.662 --> 03:34.588
We are seeking Heimdall's sword.
Can you help us?

03:34.665 --> 03:37.240
What did you say?

03:37.318 --> 03:39.484
We seek Heimdall's sword.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.653
No. You are not
getting the sword.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.155
Turn around and go back now.

03:43.157 --> 03:44.323
What? Wait.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.767
What's wrong?
Why can't we have the sword?

03:46.843 --> 03:51.421
This isn't some guessing game.
The sword is going nowhere.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.348
But this is a cause
of great importance.

03:53.425 --> 03:54.766
We need that sword for...

03:58.263 --> 04:01.356
I said, "Turn around
and go back now."

04:03.193 --> 04:04.767
[yells]

04:04.845 --> 04:08.863
[grunts]
Panther, you keep him busy here!

04:08.940 --> 04:11.941
I'll be back with the sword!

04:12.019 --> 04:14.202
Iron Fist! No! Stop!

04:14.279 --> 04:17.038
This is pointless.
I merely want to talk.

04:17.115 --> 04:19.124
[grunts] [yells, grunts]

04:21.195 --> 04:23.804
Iron Fist, tell us why
you are doing this.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.457
Because people will die
if you take that sword!

04:27.534 --> 04:30.385
Iron Fist! Wait! [Grunts]

04:32.873 --> 04:33.873
[grunting]

04:35.559 --> 04:37.225
[grunts]

04:37.302 --> 04:39.060
Have you lost your mind?

04:39.137 --> 04:40.729
[grunts] [grunts]

04:40.805 --> 04:41.637
[Iron Fist yelling]

04:41.715 --> 04:43.732
[grunts]

04:45.552 --> 04:46.552
[grunts]

04:49.223 --> 04:52.240
Ki-yaaah! [Grunts]

04:52.317 --> 04:53.742
All right. Now you got me mad.

04:56.488 --> 04:59.164
[grunting]

05:12.579 --> 05:14.137
[grunts]

05:16.266 --> 05:20.268
If you do not wish to talk,
then you will fight.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.537
Intel says the sword
is under the castle.

05:30.614 --> 05:32.489
[grunts, yells]

05:34.117 --> 05:36.935
[grunts, yells]

05:36.937 --> 05:38.770
But all the stairs only head up.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.106
All the obvious stairs, anyway.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.108
[yells]

05:43.110 --> 05:44.501
[grunting]

05:50.951 --> 05:52.467
[yells]

05:55.380 --> 05:59.066
I'm sorry, my friend,
but the stakes are too high.

06:05.223 --> 06:06.907
[Falcon] Hmm.

06:13.990 --> 06:15.248
[clanging]

06:16.810 --> 06:17.810
Huh.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.162
Cool.

06:23.817 --> 06:24.817
Oh, no!

06:27.821 --> 06:29.587
And there you are!

06:36.997 --> 06:38.054
[panting]

06:44.095 --> 06:46.187
That was easy.

06:46.264 --> 06:48.189
Too easy.

06:52.770 --> 06:56.030
[grunting]

06:56.107 --> 06:58.774
Falcon, stop! Please!

06:58.852 --> 07:00.869
[grunts]

07:00.945 --> 07:03.296
No! You don't know
what you've done!

07:03.373 --> 07:06.583
Then enlighten us. Why were you
trying to keep us from the sword?

07:09.196 --> 07:10.637
[grunts]

07:13.033 --> 07:16.801
That sword was the only thing
holding the evil inside.

07:24.561 --> 07:27.470
Dracula? Why didn't you warn me?

07:27.548 --> 07:30.882
I tried to warn you, but his evil curse
wouldn't allow me to say his name.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.975
[chuckling]

07:33.053 --> 07:35.720
That is right.

07:35.722 --> 07:39.741
I cursed the one who imprisoned
me in this wretched place,

07:39.817 --> 07:44.412
rendering him unable to speak
my name until I could be freed.

07:44.489 --> 07:47.415
Awaken, my vampires,

07:47.492 --> 07:51.678
and feast!

07:51.755 --> 07:53.505
[hissing, growling]

07:55.091 --> 07:57.592
[snarling]

07:57.669 --> 08:00.011
These bad boys look angry.

08:02.265 --> 08:04.807
[hissing, snarling]

08:14.094 --> 08:16.703
[yells]

08:16.780 --> 08:18.205
[rumbling]

08:18.281 --> 08:19.656
[Iron Fist straining]

08:25.772 --> 08:28.197
[vampires snarling]

08:28.275 --> 08:30.291
Give me your hand! [Grunts]

08:30.368 --> 08:31.943
[straining] I told you to stop.

08:31.945 --> 08:35.222
Why did you not tell us
the sword was holding Dracula?

08:35.298 --> 08:36.948
I couldn't. And besides,

08:36.950 --> 08:39.784
there would've been no danger
if you had trusted me. [Grunts]

08:39.785 --> 08:40.785
[vampires hissing]

08:42.289 --> 08:43.712
[laughs]

08:43.789 --> 08:48.235
Only one of you is responsible
for imprisoning me,

08:48.311 --> 08:50.962
but I will treat
you mortals equally.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.564
With destruction!

08:55.485 --> 08:58.361
[hissing, snarling]

09:00.398 --> 09:03.658
The vampires have cut off our exit.
We need a new way out.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.922
But a moment.
Way out, coming up.

09:08.999 --> 09:09.999
[hissing]

09:11.909 --> 09:13.909
[roars]

09:13.987 --> 09:14.986
[yells]

09:14.988 --> 09:17.171
[growling]

09:17.248 --> 09:19.674
[yells]

09:19.751 --> 09:20.751
[hissing]

09:22.329 --> 09:23.761
[Falcon] We're outta here.

09:26.090 --> 09:27.090
Yah!

09:34.675 --> 09:37.433
The mortals think they can escape.
[hissing]

09:37.511 --> 09:40.936
But there is no escape
from my wrath.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.772
After them!

09:42.849 --> 09:44.791
[hissing, snarling]

09:48.522 --> 09:50.297
[Falcon panting]
They still behind us?

09:50.373 --> 09:52.206
[Black Panther]
They are in front!

09:52.283 --> 09:54.192
In a monstrous worm!
[both grunt]

09:54.194 --> 09:55.710
[grunting]

09:58.532 --> 10:01.049
[yelling]

10:01.125 --> 10:04.311
[grunting]

10:04.387 --> 10:05.762
[grunting]

10:07.207 --> 10:08.723
[hissing]

10:12.713 --> 10:13.833
[hissing continues] [grunts]

10:13.897 --> 10:17.139
[shrieks]

10:17.217 --> 10:19.609
Oh-ho, I like this thing.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.557
I am sorry.

10:25.559 --> 10:27.892
Curse or no curse,
I acted too rashly.

10:27.894 --> 10:31.062
I should've found some way
to explain the danger.

10:31.064 --> 10:34.174
You're not the only one.
Giving orders is easy.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.067
Giving explanations
can be difficult.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.403
Uh, yeah,
speaking of explanations...

10:38.405 --> 10:41.664
Iron Fist, you wanna explain how you
and Dracula got to know each other?

10:41.742 --> 10:44.184
[Iron Fist] It started after
I arrived on Battleworld,

10:44.260 --> 10:47.854
when I found Dracula
and his vampires.

10:47.931 --> 10:50.339
He cursed me so I
couldn't say his name.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.359
So after I sealed them
in the dungeon,

10:52.435 --> 10:54.510
I tried to keep
the villagers away.

10:54.588 --> 10:58.031
To keep people from pulling the sword.
Yeah, that makes sense.

10:58.108 --> 11:00.608
But we need this sword if we're
gonna finish the Bifrost

11:00.685 --> 11:01.925
and set everything right again.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.707
Hmm. Strange.

11:07.784 --> 11:10.693
Looks like a satellite.

11:10.771 --> 11:14.455
Could've gotten caught in the same
forces that mashed up Battleworld.

11:14.532 --> 11:16.699
Specimen vial.

11:16.777 --> 11:20.962
But if there was something
inside, it is gone now.

11:21.038 --> 11:22.797
Or loose.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.800
If we are to survive, we must stop
running and formulate a strategy.

11:31.474 --> 11:33.382
[together] I have a plan.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.718
Remember, I am a king.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.404
Remember, I'm not a kid anymore.

11:37.480 --> 11:41.557
Your recklessness is partly responsible
for our current situation.

11:41.635 --> 11:44.636
[sighs] The two of you are
at each other's throats

11:44.638 --> 11:45.706
more than the vampires are.

11:45.730 --> 11:48.581
I thought
you were both Avengers.

11:48.658 --> 11:51.159
We are, but things
are a little different now.

11:51.235 --> 11:52.471
I'm not the wild kid
I used to be.

11:52.495 --> 11:54.904
Ah, indeed.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.665
Now he is merely a wild adult.

11:57.742 --> 12:00.910
Situations change, ages change,

12:00.987 --> 12:03.337
but heart and friendship
remain constant.

12:03.414 --> 12:05.765
You're Avengers and teammates.

12:05.842 --> 12:08.935
You need to act like it.

12:09.012 --> 12:11.921
Okay, T'Challa.
What's your plan?

12:11.998 --> 12:13.773
The vampires cannot follow
into the daylight.

12:13.850 --> 12:17.110
So we stay alive long enough
to make it out of the castle.

12:17.187 --> 12:20.521
My plan was the same as yours.

12:20.598 --> 12:22.949
Now we have more to fight with.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.112
[hissing, snarling]

12:30.441 --> 12:31.532
[blows landing]

12:33.353 --> 12:34.461
[grunts]

12:36.539 --> 12:37.955
[hissing, growling]

12:39.526 --> 12:41.542
[snarling]

12:41.619 --> 12:42.969
Clear a path through them!

12:43.046 --> 12:46.047
[grunting] [shrieks]

12:46.123 --> 12:48.049
[yells] [screeching]

12:48.125 --> 12:49.291
[grunting] [growling]

12:49.369 --> 12:50.292
[growls]

12:50.370 --> 12:51.370
[grunts]

12:54.374 --> 12:57.132
[growls]

12:57.210 --> 12:58.476
[yells] [shrieks]

13:00.714 --> 13:02.730
Aahh!
The sword is rather kingly.

13:02.807 --> 13:04.974
I could get used to this.

13:05.051 --> 13:07.235
Hey, I was using it first.
[vampires shrieking]

13:07.311 --> 13:09.904
You mean back when you used it
to free Dracula?

13:09.981 --> 13:11.723
Oh, you are not
pinning that all on me.

13:11.725 --> 13:14.667
The blame on that one
is at least fifty-fifty.

13:14.744 --> 13:15.744
[vampire growls]

13:19.733 --> 13:22.008
There is nowhere left to run.

13:22.085 --> 13:25.737
Surrender to me,
and I will destroy you quickly.

13:25.739 --> 13:31.166
Continue to defy me, and I will
see that you suffer greatly!

13:31.244 --> 13:33.928
Make for the daylight!
It is our best chance!

13:36.266 --> 13:37.932
[vampires growling, hissing]

13:41.771 --> 13:42.937
[panting]

13:47.110 --> 13:50.111
[growling, hissing continue]

13:53.934 --> 13:55.491
[screeching]

14:02.366 --> 14:04.959
Ha! Dracula and his boys
can't go out into the sunlight.

14:05.036 --> 14:08.203
We will take this sword
back to Avengers Tower,

14:08.281 --> 14:13.042
then the Avengers will return to put a
stop to your vampires, permanently.

14:13.119 --> 14:16.712
I think not, Avenger.

14:16.790 --> 14:19.399
You will meet your end here...

14:19.475 --> 14:21.234
now.

14:21.311 --> 14:23.227
[laughing]

14:29.636 --> 14:33.079
Dracula? Walking in sunlight?
Impossible!

14:33.156 --> 14:36.916
Vampire-kind was once limited
to the shadows.

14:36.993 --> 14:39.310
Sunlight can
no longer protect you.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.981
Not since I found this.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.908
Or, I should say,
since it found me.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.744
Alien symbiote?

14:48.822 --> 14:50.763
From the crashed satellite!

14:59.833 --> 15:03.017
[Dracula] Exquisite, isn't it?

15:03.094 --> 15:06.687
I have merged with the symbiote
known as Venom,

15:06.764 --> 15:08.522
and it has given me
the power to day-walk.

15:10.601 --> 15:13.177
I can sense more symbiotes.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.954
Thousands of them
far to the east.

15:15.031 --> 15:19.867
They have consumed entire lands
within Battleworld.

15:19.944 --> 15:23.354
Once I have paired them
with my vampire army,

15:23.356 --> 15:27.116
we will be invincible,
and all will be mine!

15:27.193 --> 15:29.802
Don't just stand there! Run!

15:29.879 --> 15:31.787
Yah!

15:31.865 --> 15:34.198
[grunts]
Nothing can stop us now.

15:34.200 --> 15:38.811
We shall claim the symbiotes,
rule Battleworld,

15:38.888 --> 15:41.389
and feast on anyone in our way!

15:41.465 --> 15:43.207
Huh?

15:43.209 --> 15:44.800
Get inside and stay down!

15:44.878 --> 15:47.803
[panicked murmuring]

15:47.881 --> 15:48.821
They will be upon us
at any moment.

15:48.898 --> 15:50.715
We can still win this,

15:50.717 --> 15:52.650
but we have to work together.
[vampires hissing]

15:55.312 --> 15:57.071
I've got a plan.

15:57.148 --> 15:59.815
Stay here and hold them off.
I'll be back.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.225
You are flying away?

16:01.227 --> 16:02.743
I know you're gonna
say it's reckless.

16:02.820 --> 16:04.153
And it is. But it'll work.

16:04.230 --> 16:07.674
I'm gonna want this again later.
I'll be right back.

16:07.750 --> 16:11.344
Falcon may be reckless,
but he is right about one thing:

16:11.421 --> 16:12.845
We need to work together.

16:12.922 --> 16:14.130
[growling]

16:16.910 --> 16:20.186
Are you ready?
I defeated Dracula once.

16:20.263 --> 16:23.581
[snarling]

16:23.583 --> 16:25.433
With your help,
we will do it again!

16:25.509 --> 16:27.585
Together!

16:27.587 --> 16:29.344
[both yell] [hissing, growling]

16:29.422 --> 16:31.689
[yelling]

16:34.685 --> 16:37.028
[grunting]

16:38.932 --> 16:41.541
[grunting]

16:41.617 --> 16:43.543
[yells]

16:43.619 --> 16:45.269
[hissing, growling continue]

16:45.271 --> 16:46.954
[yells, grunts]

16:47.031 --> 16:49.774
[yells, grunts]

16:49.776 --> 16:52.126
Keep fighting!

16:52.203 --> 16:53.553
We must buy Falcon more time!

16:56.373 --> 16:58.013
[sword blows landing]
[vampires shrieking]

17:02.638 --> 17:04.472
Iron Fist.

17:06.792 --> 17:10.810
The one who locked me up
in that castle.

17:10.887 --> 17:13.297
I owe you
for what you did to me.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.191
[laughing]

17:19.063 --> 17:22.990
And I owe you
for what you did to K'un-Lun!

17:23.067 --> 17:24.916
[growling]

17:31.818 --> 17:34.335
Yaahh!

17:36.672 --> 17:39.157
[snarling]

17:39.159 --> 17:42.343
Now join your precious K'un-Lun
in oblivion!

17:42.419 --> 17:46.255
[yells, grunts]

17:46.332 --> 17:47.607
[vampires hissing]

17:47.683 --> 17:49.834
[Black Panther] Dracula!
[vampires snarl]

17:49.836 --> 17:51.836
The sword stopped you once.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.688
No reason it cannot do so
a second time.

17:54.765 --> 17:56.440
Aah!

17:59.770 --> 18:02.029
[laughing]

18:02.106 --> 18:03.447
[laughing continues]

18:05.852 --> 18:08.294
You have no idea
what you're up against.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.041
[growling]

18:14.118 --> 18:16.302
Neither do you.

18:16.379 --> 18:18.712
[both grunting]

18:18.789 --> 18:20.714
Come on, come on...

18:22.793 --> 18:25.645
There you are.

18:25.721 --> 18:27.146
Hey! Remember me?

18:28.632 --> 18:30.316
[growls]

18:30.393 --> 18:32.467
Come and get me!

18:32.545 --> 18:34.770
[roars]

18:42.055 --> 18:43.279
[yelling] [vampires growling]

18:46.059 --> 18:47.825
[grunting]

18:49.153 --> 18:50.319
[grunts]

18:50.396 --> 18:51.745
[clangs]

18:51.822 --> 18:53.172
[Dracula] Mortals.

18:53.249 --> 18:56.333
By very definition,
your lives are limited.

19:00.164 --> 19:01.347
[grunts, yells]

19:01.424 --> 19:04.851
And now... time's up!

19:04.927 --> 19:07.344
Aahh! [Grunting]

19:09.582 --> 19:11.599
[growls]

19:11.675 --> 19:13.934
Hey, Dracula,
have you met my new friend?

19:15.346 --> 19:17.313
[snarling]

19:21.777 --> 19:23.110
[roaring] [vampires shriek]

19:30.119 --> 19:32.786
No! Forget the beast!

19:32.863 --> 19:36.698
Target the Avengers!

19:36.776 --> 19:38.200
[dragon roars] [Dracula yells]

19:38.278 --> 19:41.128
We are not out of this yet.

19:41.205 --> 19:43.964
Falcon did his part.
Now we must do ours.

19:44.041 --> 19:47.968
But what can we do? Dracula with
the symbiote is unbeatable.

19:48.045 --> 19:49.453
The symbiote itself
may be his weakness.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.956
Target it with your Iron Fist.
[pained growling]

19:51.958 --> 19:54.642
I don't know if I can.

19:54.718 --> 19:57.295
You can do this.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.796
I will buy you the time
to focus your strength.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.056
Do not waste it.

20:01.134 --> 20:02.816
[growls]

20:02.893 --> 20:05.244
You may have scattered
my vampires,

20:05.321 --> 20:06.521
but all of this is for naught!

20:16.816 --> 20:17.816
[grunts]

20:19.152 --> 20:22.320
[grunts]

20:22.322 --> 20:24.672
With the symbiote,
I am invincible!

20:24.748 --> 20:26.674
Iron Fist, now!

20:26.750 --> 20:30.678
[yells]

20:30.754 --> 20:33.773
[screaming]

20:36.502 --> 20:38.352
[yells] The light!

20:43.843 --> 20:47.269
We did it, together.

20:47.347 --> 20:51.515
We have to get back to Avengers Tower.
Will you be okay here?

20:51.517 --> 20:53.867
I won't be here.
I must follow Dracula

20:53.944 --> 20:58.356
and stop his evil before he reaches
the symbiotes in the east.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.132
You have the difficult task.

21:00.209 --> 21:02.209
You must stop the Beyonder.

21:02.286 --> 21:04.286
Namaste, friends.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.639
To you as well, Iron Fist.

21:10.886 --> 21:12.536
Uh, you can give me back
the sword now.

21:12.538 --> 21:16.557
[chuckles] But I look
so kingly with it.

21:16.633 --> 21:19.393
Besides,
I use it better than you.

21:19.470 --> 21:22.380
You only used it
because I gave it to you.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.902
Yet another reckless move
on your part.

21:23.974 --> 21:28.068
Really? Did you just steal
Heimdall's sword from me?

21:28.145 --> 21:30.645
After all I did to get it out?
After all you did?

21:30.723 --> 21:38.723
The blame on that one
is at least fifty-fifty.
