WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.204
Family is the ultimate power
on The Gifted.

00:03.237 --> 00:05.573
A lot of people
have been fighting this fight
for a long time,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.141
and now it's our turn.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.711
And check out our other
Fox programs-- The Orville,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.546
Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.715
Gotham needs more people
who are willing
to fight for her.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.953
-Hey, look who's here.
-Help! (screaming)

00:22.756 --> 00:25.326
-I was just so angry.
-You couldn't feel anything.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.062
Mom, accept it,
Andy is a mutant.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.598
This is the Sentinel Services.
We will use deadly force.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.733
THUNDERBIRD: Clarice,
you got to get us out of here.

00:32.766 --> 00:33.734
(gunshot)

00:33.767 --> 00:35.169
-(grunts)
-Dad! -No!

00:35.203 --> 00:36.870
-Dad!
-No!

00:36.904 --> 00:38.372
-Where is my dad?
-We need to go back.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.673
THUNDERBIRD: Right now, we need
to take care of Clarice.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.008
CAITLIN:
She may be in shock.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.510
It may be affecting
her abilities.

00:42.543 --> 00:43.511
THUNDERBIRD:
What does she need?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.246
Hypercortisone-D
to stabilize her powers.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.348
ECLIPSE: Clarice is still
inside. Give me the medication.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.582
I'll go in there,
I'll try to give it to her.

00:48.616 --> 00:49.683
No, you don't know the dosage.

00:49.717 --> 00:50.818
Too much could make this worse.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.554
(gasps)

00:53.587 --> 00:54.922
It's gonna be okay.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.724
We are gonna do a deal today.

00:56.757 --> 01:00.261
I will cooperate with you,
but I go down for this alone.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.363
And my wife and children
stay out of prison.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.631
One condition.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.299
I get the Mutant Underground.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.539
(insects chirping)

01:11.572 --> 01:13.574
It is always
this quiet out here?

01:13.607 --> 01:15.576
You get used to it.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.578
How did you guys
get your hands on this place?

01:17.611 --> 01:18.979
It's huge.

01:19.012 --> 01:22.216
Yeah, it was condemned
after the Oakwood Riots.

01:22.250 --> 01:26.220
National Guard stormed
a mutant orphanage up the road.

01:26.254 --> 01:29.457
Some poor kid lost control,
destroyed the whole area.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.825
They didn't know what he did
exactly, so folks stayed away.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.761
We needed a place, so...

01:33.794 --> 01:35.429
Well, I love
what you've done with it.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.398
(chuckles)

01:37.431 --> 01:40.601
Look, we're hiding fugitives,
not hosting garden parties.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.270
What matters is we're together.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.373
We fight for each other.
We take care of each other.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.611
Ever wonder what you did
in a past life to deserve this?

01:50.644 --> 01:54.682
Having a gene
that forces us to live this way?

01:56.384 --> 01:58.051
Is that really what you think?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.922
I wouldn't change who I am

02:01.955 --> 02:05.959
or... or what I can do
for anything.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.098
Tell me this.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.933
When you discovered
your ability,

02:12.966 --> 02:16.504
what was the first thing you did
just for the joy of it?

02:16.537 --> 02:19.006
(laughs softly)
Joy?

02:19.039 --> 02:20.608
I was living
on the streets of BogotÃ¡

02:20.641 --> 02:22.510
sleeping in a cardboard box.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.077
Come on.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.315
Okay, fine.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.953
Know why I started
wearing steel-toed boots

02:32.986 --> 02:34.222
and metal bracelets?

02:34.255 --> 02:36.023
Misguided fashion sense?

02:36.056 --> 02:37.458
No.

02:37.491 --> 02:41.128
Because when I was 16,
I discovered I could do this.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.163
(electricity discharging)

02:56.377 --> 02:58.579
Wow.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.116
Your turn.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.687
Seriously, I don't know...

03:08.088 --> 03:09.490
It's dumb.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.991
Come on.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.026
(laughs softly)

03:16.797 --> 03:18.766
(grunts)

03:37.217 --> 03:39.219
*

03:51.599 --> 03:53.233
Well, look at that.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.803
(glass clinks)

04:02.776 --> 04:05.746
What is that?

04:05.779 --> 04:09.450
I... I, uh...

04:09.483 --> 04:13.454
I think
it's the Aurora Borealis.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.222
It happens in the Arctic,

04:15.255 --> 04:20.160
when the solar energy hits
the magnetosphere.

04:20.193 --> 04:23.263
They say it's the most
beautiful thing on Earth.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.368
Not even close.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.989
(keys jingling)

04:49.022 --> 04:50.791
(lock clicks, door opens)

04:54.628 --> 04:57.030
JACE:
Ms. Dane. How you doing?

04:57.064 --> 04:58.999
I'm Jace Turner.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.834
Sentinel Services.

05:00.868 --> 05:04.438
Listen, I'd love to chat,
but I'm sort of busy here.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.674
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

05:06.707 --> 05:10.177
I think you're gonna want
to make time for this, though.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.979
I'm about to take down
all your friends

05:12.012 --> 05:14.014
-in the Mutant Underground.
-Good luck with that.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.449
Yeah, I don't think
I'm gonna need luck.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.851
I'm gonna start
with Marcos Diaz.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.187
Street name Eclipse?
Does that ring a bell?

05:20.220 --> 05:23.223
Course it does, that's...
that's your baby daddy, right?

05:23.256 --> 05:24.658
So here's what I'm thinking:
I'm want to give you

05:24.692 --> 05:26.527
one more chance
to cooperate with us.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.829
If you do,
when the little one's born,

05:28.862 --> 05:30.464
I'll arrange visitations
for you and Diaz.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.833
You guys can still
have some sort of family.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.201
In prison.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.169
No, I was thinking the Bahamas.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.205
Yeah, prison.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.207
Ms. Dane...

05:40.240 --> 05:42.242
prison's where you want
to end up right now.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.745
If you don't cooperate, you're
going someplace much worse.

05:44.778 --> 05:48.015
So you can give me
what I want here,

05:48.048 --> 05:50.484
or you will give me
what I want there,

05:50.518 --> 05:53.253
because, believe me,

05:53.286 --> 05:56.457
everybody gives me
what I want there.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.995
Anyway.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.196
Think about it.

06:03.230 --> 06:06.667
And think really hard, okay?

06:06.700 --> 06:09.069
Because if we do this bust
without you,

06:09.102 --> 06:10.638
you got no cards left.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.509
(door closes)

06:15.543 --> 06:17.177
(exhales)

06:17.210 --> 06:19.847
ECLIPSE: So, what,
we just forget about Lorna

06:19.880 --> 06:22.349
-'cause she's behind bars? -You
know that's not what I'm saying.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.084
God knows what she's going
through in there.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.620
You're talking
about breaking into a jail.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.722
20-foot walls. With guards.

06:28.756 --> 06:32.025
-With guns.
-We have a way past all of it:

06:32.059 --> 06:34.027
Clarice.
You saw what she can do.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.064
I saw her tearing
through the fabric of space.

06:37.097 --> 06:40.067
She almost destroyed half
the building. She almost died.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.068
She's fine now.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.737
In your expert medical opinion.

06:43.771 --> 06:44.905
Yeah, well,
she's better than she was.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.540
Even if she is,
she's nowhere near ready

06:46.574 --> 06:48.241
to take on
what you're proposing.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.210
Then train her.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.812
Just like you trained most
of the people in this room.

06:51.845 --> 06:52.913
You train her.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.414
DREAMER:
Johnny, Clarice did

06:54.448 --> 06:55.483
get herself out of jail.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.618
I mean, maybe she can do this.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.252
So you're on his side.

06:59.286 --> 07:00.788
No.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.823
I'm on Lorna's side.
She's my friend.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.631
All right.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.132
W-Wait.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.468
We still live in a country
of laws.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.336
H-Have we tried calling
a lawyer?

07:16.369 --> 07:19.272
Some members of Congress
are sympathetic to mutants.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.108
-You're really overestimating...
-Why not try?

07:21.141 --> 07:22.309
We can assault a building,

07:22.342 --> 07:23.777
but we can't talk to a person?

07:23.811 --> 07:26.179
-You said you wanted to fight.
-I do.

07:26.213 --> 07:29.182
But there are ways to fight
that don't involve battles.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.852
-I have connections. I can reach
out. -We can't have contact

07:31.885 --> 07:33.754
with the outside world
while you're staying here.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.189
Sentinel Services will be
looking for you. We can't risk

07:36.223 --> 07:38.492
-the exposure.
-Even if it could help?

07:38.526 --> 07:39.927
Much better odds
they turn on us.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.862
I'm sorry, Caitlin.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.031
No, it's too dangerous.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.542
This is the jankiest board ever.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.209
I'm pretty sure
that money has mold on it.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.911
Okay, that's not...

07:59.012 --> 08:00.380
It's mold.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.782
-It's mold.
-(chuckles)

08:01.815 --> 08:03.383
So, uh, I guess since the tens

08:03.416 --> 08:04.885
are all stuck together,
I figure we use

08:04.918 --> 08:07.387
the ones as tens
and then the little paper nubs

08:07.420 --> 08:08.822
-will be the ones.
-Doesn't matter to me.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.157
I'm gonna win it all anyway.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.458
Sure. Remember last time.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.459
Oh, when I let you win?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.461
It's not your birthday anymore.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.697
-ANDY: Okay, just take your
piece. -(Lauren chuckles)

08:16.730 --> 08:18.832
LAUREN:
I'll be...

08:18.866 --> 08:20.467
nickel.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.469
I think I'm gonna be the shoe.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.572
No. You can't be the shoe.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.540
-Be the bottle cap. -What do you
mean? I just called the shoe.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.542
-I don't care. Put it back.
-What's your problem, psycho?

08:28.576 --> 08:29.610
Dad's always the shoe.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.580
Okay?

08:32.613 --> 08:33.947
Yeah.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.355
This Lorna chick went to jail
saving my ass. I owe her.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.224
But it won't work.
I can't do anything.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.327
See?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.930
Nothing.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.999
And you want me to help you get
into a jail? You'd be

08:52.032 --> 08:54.101
better off with a couple
glow sticks and a hacksaw.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.436
-(chuckles)
-Something changed

08:56.469 --> 08:58.872
after I got sick.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.541
I woke up
with this new beauty mark here.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.277
And my powers--
I don't know-- they're...

09:04.311 --> 09:05.946
they're broken.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.949
Hey. Abilities don't break.

09:08.982 --> 09:13.386
Most mutants first access their
abilities from strong emotions.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.555
Fear, anger, pain.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.290
But those are all unreliable.

09:17.324 --> 09:20.427
The challenge is to tap
into something positive.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.129
-Positive.
-Mm-hmm.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.132
Like, what, we do some hot yoga
and find my spirit animal?

09:25.165 --> 09:27.134
Um... no, thanks.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.402
I'm pretty sure your
spirit animal would bite me.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.971
No. It'd rip your head off.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.473
No, it's impossible.
My head can't be ripped off.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.375
Hey. We're gonna work on it.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.611
See you in the morning.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.588
Excuse me.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.923
Hey. Hey.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.094
(quietly):
How'd it go with Clarice?

09:54.127 --> 09:56.096
Um...

09:56.129 --> 09:58.666
it's-it's gonna be a... process.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.268
Her power has always been fueled
by fear. She needs

10:01.301 --> 10:03.570
to find something she cares
about enough to get past it.

10:03.603 --> 10:07.607
Johnny, Lorna doesn't have time
for us to make mistakes.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.510
Let me help.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.147
-No.
-I can give Clarice memories,

10:14.181 --> 10:16.149
make her think
Lorna's her best friend.

10:16.183 --> 10:20.153
You're talking about... planting
stuff in people's heads.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.122
That goes bad, all right?

10:22.155 --> 10:23.957
Remember Walker?

10:23.991 --> 10:25.558
Eve?

10:26.559 --> 10:28.461
Yeah.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.698
I don't want to take shortcuts
on this.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.333
All right, Johnny.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.135
She's all yours.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.546
(crickets chirping)

10:48.381 --> 10:50.317
(whispering):
Andy.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.119
Kids, wake up.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.887
Mom?

10:53.921 --> 10:55.322
-What's going on?
-What's wrong?

10:55.355 --> 10:56.824
Nothing's wrong.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.158
I have to go somewhere.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.426
I'll be back tomorrow.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.729
Tomorrow?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.030
We're not supposed to leave.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.231
Where are you going?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.365
Your Uncle Danny's house.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.834
I'm hoping he can help

11:06.867 --> 11:08.802
-with your dad.
-LAUREN: Uncle Danny?

11:08.836 --> 11:10.971
Mom, we haven't seen him
since Grandma's funeral.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.640
No, screw that-- if you're
going, I'm going with you.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.075
No. No way.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.710
It could be dangerous out there.

11:16.744 --> 11:20.547
Mom, remember when those
government guys attacked us?

11:20.580 --> 11:22.883
If that happens again,
we can protect you.

11:22.916 --> 11:26.053
Mom. We already lost Dad.

11:26.086 --> 11:29.022
We can't lose you too.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.058
Not taking no for an answer.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.599
Let's go.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.634
*

11:51.945 --> 11:54.681
All right,
so you met Diaz at the bar

11:54.714 --> 11:57.250
to broker a deal to move your
family to Mexico-- tell me...

11:57.284 --> 11:59.052
tell me about the bar.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.454
Who was there?
Who did he speak to?

12:01.488 --> 12:03.623
(low, indistinct chatter)

12:07.928 --> 12:10.530
He seemed to know the bartender.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.799
Okay. Bartender's the target

12:11.832 --> 12:13.233
to make contact
with the Underground.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.634
Get a recon team out there,

12:14.667 --> 12:16.303
find anything out about him...

12:16.336 --> 12:18.071
So what, you just want me to...

12:18.105 --> 12:20.774
walk in and say that I escaped
from Sentinel Services?

12:20.808 --> 12:23.143
No. We're gonna put out an APB

12:23.176 --> 12:25.645
saying that you managed
to evade capture.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.447
If the bar is connected
to the Underground,

12:27.480 --> 12:28.648
then they'll hear about it.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.284
What if I can make contact?

12:31.318 --> 12:33.921
Then you get them
to take you to your family,

12:33.954 --> 12:36.589
and we get Diaz and roll up
their whole operation.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.758
What happens after?

12:38.792 --> 12:40.727
To all of them?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.329
What do you mean?

12:42.362 --> 12:43.797
They're a terrorist
organization.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.465
They'll be dealt with
accordingly.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.441
THUNDERBIRD: Did you think about
what I said last night?

12:54.474 --> 12:56.676
Yeah, I did.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.079
But what I can do, I...

12:59.112 --> 13:02.449
Literally, I have the power
to bail out of bad situations.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.452
So being scared is
just a big part of it.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.987
It's not all of it.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.789
In the marines...
when you want to give up,

13:09.823 --> 13:12.692
they train you to focus
on what you care about most.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.594
To hold onto it
like your life depended on it.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.297
Because at some point, it will.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.167
Okay, so what
did you care about?

13:22.369 --> 13:24.938
Back then I had a lot to prove.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.174
About being Apache, a mutant.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.609
But what if
I don't have anything?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.478
Think about what you love now.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.883
I don't know, can it be...

13:35.916 --> 13:38.018
a warm jelly donut?

13:38.051 --> 13:39.552
Sure.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.022
For today, sure.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.724
Look that way.
Maybe put the coffee down.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.427
Good.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.829
Just relax.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.231
-All right?
-Okay.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.399
(Thunderbird inhales)

13:52.432 --> 13:54.167
Breathe.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.003
Picture that thing.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.637
That thing you care about.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.407
A warm jelly donut.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.642
Picture it.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.078
-And go to it.
-(crackling)

14:06.846 --> 14:08.581
Look at that.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.450
(Thunderbird chuckles)

14:12.019 --> 14:13.686
(frustrated groan)

14:13.720 --> 14:16.389
This is exactly why
I shouldn't be doing this.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.391
Last time I tried, I nearly
took down your entire...

14:18.425 --> 14:20.193
No, no, don't focus on the fear.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.761
You focus...

14:22.795 --> 14:24.965
Are you having a stroke?

14:31.404 --> 14:33.473
Oh, this is your thing.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.193
BLINK:
Yo.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.894
Sherlock. What's going on?

14:54.928 --> 14:57.064
We have a problem.

14:58.765 --> 15:01.368
They left last night,
didn't take much with them.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.436
Why the hell
would Caitlin do this?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.872
-She believes she can help.
-(sighs)

15:05.905 --> 15:08.541
That whatever connections
she has can make a difference.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.978
She spent her whole life
believing in the system.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.712
How could she be so naive?

15:12.745 --> 15:14.948
No, I talked to her about this;
I thought she understood.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.783
Ah, some people have
to learn the hard way.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.285
We need to go after them.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.220
Aw, John,
we don't have time for this.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.555
Lorna could disappear into
a federal hellhole any day now.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.558
If they get arrested
before they come back here,

15:25.592 --> 15:27.627
they know where this place is.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.462
They get caught, we get caught,

15:29.496 --> 15:31.831
-and we don't get Lorna back.
-Yeah.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.939
It's clear. Come on.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.009
We can't just hike
the whole way.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.444
Uncle Danny lives, like,
all the way across town.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.446
Mom, we're gonna get noticed
on the street.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.448
-We have to get a cab.
-To Buckhead?

15:48.481 --> 15:52.019
I... I have about enough cash to
get us to that tree over there.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.520
And with our
bank accounts frozen...

15:53.553 --> 15:55.322
Well, why don't I
just unfreeze them?

15:55.355 --> 15:58.992
Wait. Are you seriously
suggesting we rob a bank?

15:59.026 --> 16:00.193
Yeah.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.528
I... I'm not hearing this.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.862
Mom, why should we have

16:02.895 --> 16:04.631
to hold back
when nobody else does?

16:04.664 --> 16:06.199
Because people could get hurt,

16:06.233 --> 16:08.001
and because we don't rob banks.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.102
Andy, if we're ever gonna have

16:09.136 --> 16:10.303
a chance
at a normal life again...

16:10.337 --> 16:12.105
Normal? Lauren,
you got to be kidding me.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.306
Normal is gone!

16:13.340 --> 16:15.175
Normal doesn't exist anymore.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.376
Okay?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.947
(rumbling)

16:20.980 --> 16:22.015
(car alarm blaring)

16:22.049 --> 16:24.184
Andy!

16:24.217 --> 16:25.852
ANDY:
There. Cab fare.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.455
The bank is safe.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.923
Happy?

16:36.696 --> 16:39.332
(crackling)

16:39.366 --> 16:40.900
(frustrated groan)

16:54.081 --> 16:55.715
(groans softly)

16:55.748 --> 16:58.385
I keep getting close,
and then I just...

16:58.418 --> 17:00.253
I lose it.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.593
I know it's hard,

17:06.626 --> 17:08.095
but Lorna's counting on us.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.996
That's what everyone
keeps telling me.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.331
I know. I'm sorry.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.032
(sighs):
It's just...

17:13.066 --> 17:14.867
she's my best friend.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.938
-What did Johnny say?
-Some Mr. Miyagi stuff

17:18.971 --> 17:23.276
about focusing on something
that's meaningful to me.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.079
Well, there's...
there's got to be somebody.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.081
An old boyfriend, maybe, or...

17:28.115 --> 17:30.317
girlfriend?

17:31.384 --> 17:34.187
Sorry. There's nobody.

17:34.221 --> 17:37.724
So you can tell your boyfriend
that this plan isn't gonna work.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.892
-What makes you think he's
my boyfriend? -Oh, I don't know,

17:39.926 --> 17:41.294
the way you look
when you talk about him.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.962
The fact that
you're the only one here

17:42.995 --> 17:44.331
that calls him Johnny.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.869
I... came here as a refugee.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.739
When I decided to stay on
and help, we agreed that...

17:52.772 --> 17:56.443
if we were gonna work together,
we shouldn't be together.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.615
Look, about your portals...

18:07.520 --> 18:11.724
(exhales) Johnny usually knows
what he's talking about, so...

18:11.758 --> 18:13.960
just keep at it.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.729
Great.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.666
Awesome pep talk.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.269
LAUREN:
I forgot how big this place is.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.271
ANDY:
What if they're not home?

18:24.304 --> 18:26.606
There's only one way
to find out.

18:29.376 --> 18:32.412
-I think he's still counting
coins. -Yeah, he was not happy

18:32.445 --> 18:34.281
about the coins.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.250
Caitlin.

18:37.284 --> 18:38.685
Hey.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.321
DANIEL:
Kids.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.692
-Oh, Danny.
-Thank God you're okay.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.527
I'm sorry we didn't call.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.429
-Can we come in?
-The police were here.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.963
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

18:50.997 --> 18:53.200
Yes, I do. Please, Danny.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.136
Here you go.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.871
Thanks.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.207
Where's Mary?

19:00.240 --> 19:02.309
Uh, she's, uh, out of town.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.711
Sales conference. I'm sorry
we don't have more pizza.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.179
We weren't expecting company.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.614
No, it's-it's fine.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.048
Thank you.

19:11.751 --> 19:15.955
I don't know if this is
inappropriate or whatever,

19:15.988 --> 19:18.358
-but did you guys have
to fight off the cops? -Yeah,

19:18.391 --> 19:20.327
-that's real inappropriate, son.
-LAUREN: It wasn't like that.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.628
We just ran.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.730
Tore up some robots, though.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.233
Dope.
So have you guys been, like,

19:26.266 --> 19:28.368
-hiding out on the streets,
or...? -No.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.903
There's this group--
they help mutants in trouble.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.506
SCOTT: Cool.
Like the Underground Railroad.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.974
DANIEL:
Scott.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.910
Please? You know what?
Why don't you guys

19:37.944 --> 19:39.712
go play some video games?

19:39.746 --> 19:40.980
Okay?

19:41.013 --> 19:43.550
Go on.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.025
It's good to see you, Cait.
(sniffs)

19:53.059 --> 19:54.594
But you shouldn't have come.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.264
Where else could I go?

19:57.297 --> 19:59.999
Jenny's in Arizona.
Mom's gone.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.568
I need to find Reed.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.903
Danny, you know people
at the firm.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.905
Judges, the-the mayor...

20:05.938 --> 20:07.407
members of Congress.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.342
You spent half
of Mom's last Christmas

20:09.376 --> 20:11.511
-telling us how they all go
to your golf club. -Yeah,

20:11.544 --> 20:14.847
I was at the club the other day,
and people won't even look at me

20:14.881 --> 20:16.416
because of all this.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.218
But you worked
on Senator Montez's campaign.

20:19.252 --> 20:22.021
Yeah, and he ran the campaign
on a "security first" platform.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.590
I can't just call him up
and ask him

20:23.623 --> 20:27.126
to pull some strings
for some... outlaws.

20:27.159 --> 20:29.228
I don't even know

20:29.262 --> 20:31.130
-if Reed's alive.
-I could go to jail.

20:31.163 --> 20:34.000
for even letting you
through the door.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.772
When Mom was sick,
I left you alone.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.542
I-I... I knew you didn't like
seeing her like that,

20:42.575 --> 20:46.078
and... I never asked for help.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.381
But now I am asking.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.550
Caitie...

20:50.583 --> 20:53.286
I got to consider my family.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.923
My children... my husband,

20:56.956 --> 20:59.559
-they are your family, too.
-You can stay the night.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.728
Okay? I've got cash
in the safe; you can have it.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.563
You can have all of it, okay?
But in the morning,

21:03.596 --> 21:04.964
you got to go.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.641
JACE:
Hey, look who's famous.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.409
Headquarters just sent out
the notice.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.177
As of an hour ago,
you're the subject

21:18.210 --> 21:19.879
of a multi-agency manhunt.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.949
-I'm flattered.
-With any luck,

21:22.982 --> 21:25.352
our target will have heard
all about it by now.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.919
You just need to convince them

21:26.953 --> 21:30.189
to take you
to the Mutant Underground.

21:30.222 --> 21:32.592
We're gonna track you...

21:32.625 --> 21:34.327
with this.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.995
Put your left leg up, please.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.999
It's thin enough
that it won't register

21:40.032 --> 21:41.334
if they pat you down.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.003
(beeps)

21:44.036 --> 21:45.872
There we go.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.307
It also doesn't come off
unless I unlock it.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.677
So... Unless you're planning
on losing a foot.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.679
I always say that
'cause there was a guy...

21:52.712 --> 21:55.382
Got some activity here.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.684
Out back.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.152
JACE:
That the bartender?

22:00.186 --> 22:03.356
-Yeah. -All righty, kids,
it's game time.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.860
Go get 'em, tiger.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.571
Mr. Strucker?

22:18.605 --> 22:22.274
Try to remember that
your family's depending on you.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.196
-What are you doing here?
-I was here a few days ago.

22:44.230 --> 22:47.099
I met up with Marcos Diaz
to talk about moving my family.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.569
-I remember who you are.
-We ran into Sentinel Services.

22:49.602 --> 22:50.937
We got separated.
I just want

22:50.970 --> 22:53.172
-to talk to Marcos.
-Do you got any idea

22:53.205 --> 22:54.741
how much heat you got on you?
Cops are looking for you

22:54.774 --> 22:56.576
everywhere. Easy.

22:59.979 --> 23:02.715
-Shouldn't we go in there?
-No.

23:02.749 --> 23:06.018
He'll sell it.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.220
I just want to find my family.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.890
-Get out of here. -Why do you
think Marcos was talking to me?

23:10.923 --> 23:13.225
I have information.
I was a prosecutor.

23:13.259 --> 23:16.395
I know about the investigation
into your network, I know

23:16.429 --> 23:18.898
the police, I know the federal
agencies. I can help you.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.200
-I just want to find my family
first. -I'm not the one that

23:21.233 --> 23:22.702
-makes the rules, man. -I have
nowhere else to go, all right?

23:22.735 --> 23:25.304
I have nowhere else to go.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.773
If you're not gonna help me,

23:26.806 --> 23:28.040
then you may as well
just pull the trigger.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.942
(gun clicks)

23:29.976 --> 23:31.578
You'd be doing me a favor.

23:36.583 --> 23:39.752
All right.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.788
Come on.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.465
So how the hell did you get away
from Sentinel Services?

23:52.499 --> 23:55.968
We were in an old warehouse,
and... I found a crawlspace,

23:56.002 --> 23:58.337
and hid in there
until they gave up the search.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.573
Gave up?
They don't give up easy.

24:00.607 --> 24:04.076
No. My kids are the ones
with the abilities.

24:04.110 --> 24:07.780
I guess they were
less concerned with me.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.583
Lucky you.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.385
In here.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.525
That's Sheila.
Little one's Dominique.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.326
This is Reed.

24:20.359 --> 24:22.128
He'll be going out
with us tonight.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.796
We'll meet my family then?

24:23.830 --> 24:25.532
Don't work like that.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.333
I take you to the drop point.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.736
Someone from HQ picks you up,
drives you the rest of the way.

24:32.038 --> 24:34.373
Have some supper.

24:34.406 --> 24:36.108
I'll be back after last call.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.877
Get some shut-eye.

24:40.412 --> 24:43.650
You hungry?

24:43.683 --> 24:45.384
(sighs)
No thank you.

24:45.417 --> 24:47.053
I couldn't keep anything down.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.955
I'm too nervous.

24:48.988 --> 24:52.358
You two alone?

24:52.391 --> 24:54.561
They took my husband.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.863
Daddy's different, too.

24:56.896 --> 25:00.066
Where'd they take him?

25:00.099 --> 25:01.868
Sentinel Services
detention center.

25:01.901 --> 25:04.503
-They tried to take us, but...
-Both of you?

25:04.537 --> 25:09.141
To them, she's just a future
threat who carries the X-Gene.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.110
Some world, huh?

25:12.545 --> 25:14.914
(sighs):
Oh.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.749
Are you okay?

25:16.783 --> 25:18.517
Yeah.

25:18.551 --> 25:21.721
Sentinel Services shot me
with an immobilization round.

25:21.754 --> 25:25.057
It's been a few days,
but it hurts, you know?

25:33.532 --> 25:37.169
-(whooshing)
-(Reed gasps, Sheila sighs)

25:37.203 --> 25:38.938
(whooshing)

25:42.108 --> 25:44.611
What did you just do?

25:44.644 --> 25:46.679
I took away your pain.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.215
I can't heal, but that I can do.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.285
We have to stick together,
right?

25:53.319 --> 25:55.487
Right.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.463
-(gunfire) -SCOTT: Always knew
you were a beast at Medal

26:04.496 --> 26:06.733
of Honor, but now you're, like,
the beast of real life, too.

26:06.766 --> 26:09.368
-All right. -You know what I'm
gonna call you now? De-Struckto.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.471
-Get it? It's like Strucker...
-Yeah, I get it. Please don't.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.707
Could you, like,
destroy a skyscraper?

26:14.741 --> 26:17.476
Uh, I don't know.
Probably not.

26:17.509 --> 26:19.578
-Here, cover my flank. I'm going
in. -I got you, De-Struckto.

26:19.612 --> 26:21.914
-Dude, really? -What about,
like, a jumbo jet? -Man,

26:21.948 --> 26:24.617
I'm trying to play. Why would
I even want to destroy a plane?

26:24.651 --> 26:26.585
I don't know. Like, if it was
attacking you or something.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.120
Attacking me with what?
Luggage?

26:28.154 --> 26:29.555
Jumbo jets don't have guns.

26:29.588 --> 26:33.125
-(boom)
-MALE VOICE: Game over. -Great.

26:33.159 --> 26:36.062
First game in weeks,
and it's a total slaughter.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.596
This is gonna kill our ranking.

26:37.630 --> 26:40.099
Dude, who cares?
I need to see what you can do.

26:40.132 --> 26:42.501
-Come on, just do something
to this. Please? -No.

26:42.534 --> 26:45.504
-I can't just
do it out of nowhere. -Andy.

26:45.537 --> 26:48.474
You can't do it at all.
Don't encourage him.

26:48.507 --> 26:50.242
Go back to Insta-stalking Jack.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.610
Nyah.

26:52.879 --> 26:54.246
Oh, my God.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.949
What? What's wrong?

26:58.484 --> 27:00.619
-It's nothing, okay?
-Hey, what is it?!

27:04.390 --> 27:06.959
ANDY:
It's our house.

27:06.993 --> 27:09.295
That's Lucas. We've been
going to school with him

27:09.328 --> 27:12.098
-since second grade. -Hey, Andy,
they're just stupid kids.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.967
It doesn't matter.

27:15.001 --> 27:18.170
(metallic rattling,
whirring)

27:19.371 --> 27:23.009
-Andy!
-(clanks)

27:23.042 --> 27:25.011
No way.

27:26.879 --> 27:29.615
CAITLIN:
Guys?

27:29.648 --> 27:33.185
-Is everybody okay?
-Yeah. These dorks

27:33.219 --> 27:35.354
are just going all
WWE on each other.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.056
It's nothing. (laughs)

27:37.089 --> 27:39.191
You guys should try
to get some sleep, all right?

27:39.225 --> 27:42.294
Mom? Is Uncle Danny gonna help?

27:42.328 --> 27:44.563
We're working on it.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.273
(phone chimes)

28:06.518 --> 28:08.587
Looks like they're heading out.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.826
-His tracker transmitting?
-Loud and clear.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.928
-(static) -Bravo Team,
Charlie Team. Look alive.

28:15.962 --> 28:17.997
Target's heading west
on Sycamore.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.598
Pick 'em up on Ninth.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.233
Alpha Team's rolling out now.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.102
(steady beeping)

28:24.804 --> 28:26.372
(engine starting)

28:26.405 --> 28:28.240
All right, let's do this.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.802
It's okay.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.404
Mommy said
we're going to the safe place.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.807
We don't have
to be scared anymore.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.143
That's right, honey.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.078
Worst part is over.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.679
We're with friends now.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.322
Stop the van.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.925
-What? -I said stop the van.
I have to get out!

29:18.958 --> 29:20.392
There's a vehicle behind us.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.929
-Calm down. I can hide the van.
-You don't get it.

29:22.962 --> 29:25.131
-They're following us.
-Wait. What?

29:25.164 --> 29:26.632
Sentinel Services
put a tracker on me.

29:26.665 --> 29:29.501
-You son of a bitch!
-Oh, my God. What did you do?

29:29.535 --> 29:32.238
I was just trying to protect
my family. Wanted to see them.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.273
I didn't...
I would never...

29:34.306 --> 29:36.242
SHEILA:
It's okay.

29:36.275 --> 29:40.512
-Just stop the van, and I'll get
out. -We stop, and we're dead!

29:40.546 --> 29:42.181
You set us up!

29:42.214 --> 29:43.782
(Sheila gasps)

29:49.856 --> 29:52.624
I'm sorry.

29:56.728 --> 29:59.465
Wait. No. Damn it!

30:07.473 --> 30:10.209
Was I unclear?

30:10.242 --> 30:13.179
Your job was to stay in the van.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.647
-You were clear enough.
-(laughs)

30:15.681 --> 30:20.019
-You just made the biggest
mistake of your life. -No.

30:20.052 --> 30:23.289
-But I got pretty damn close.
-We had a deal, Mr. Strucker.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.391
And you can shove that deal
up your ass.

30:41.607 --> 30:42.841
(soft, electrical buzzing)

30:58.790 --> 31:01.027
You can do this.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.996
(sighs)

31:04.030 --> 31:06.032
(electrical hissing)

31:06.065 --> 31:08.267
(sighs)

31:08.300 --> 31:11.670
-(gasping)
-(rapid beeping)

31:11.703 --> 31:13.439
(gasping and beeping continue)

31:13.472 --> 31:14.773
(creaking)

31:14.806 --> 31:18.210
Come on! Please! Please!

31:18.244 --> 31:22.748
(yelling)

31:22.781 --> 31:25.284
(screaming)

31:26.618 --> 31:29.421
-(beeps, electrical buzz)
-(gasps, cries)

31:29.455 --> 31:31.390
(gasping)

31:31.423 --> 31:33.092
(crying)

31:33.125 --> 31:34.793
(coughing)

31:34.826 --> 31:37.263
(coughing, gasping)

31:39.731 --> 31:41.934
(wheezing)

31:41.968 --> 31:43.569
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

31:47.839 --> 31:51.277
That's just sad.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.586
-(gasps)
-Shh. Caitlin.

32:00.619 --> 32:03.089
Caitlin, listen to me. I don't
have time to explain right now.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.457
You are in danger here.
Where are Andy and Lauren?

32:05.491 --> 32:06.959
-What are you doing here?
-Shh.

32:06.993 --> 32:09.261
-You can't just break in.
-You don't understand...

32:09.295 --> 32:12.731
Yes, I do. I understand that
I am trying to help my husband.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.934
-What, with favors and phone
calls? We discussed this. -No.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.971
I distinctly remember. There
was, in fact, no discussion.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.806
Guys, we need to go.
If we can find you,

32:20.839 --> 32:22.808
-others can, too.
-DANIEL: Cait?

32:22.841 --> 32:25.311
-What's going on?
-What? -Oh.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.146
-Danny.
-Relax.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.681
Danny, please.
Everything's okay.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.917
-No, it doesn't look okay to me.
-No. -(tires squealing)

32:31.950 --> 32:33.185
These are the people
who are trying

32:33.219 --> 32:35.421
-to help us.
-(tires squeaking)

32:35.454 --> 32:37.456
What the hell?

32:37.489 --> 32:39.858
Caitlin, what... You bring
mutants into my home?

32:39.891 --> 32:42.094
Mutants?

32:42.128 --> 32:44.263
-(indistinct chatter)
-Seriously, Danny?

32:44.296 --> 32:46.432
The only mutants
I brought into your home are

32:46.465 --> 32:49.268
-your niece and nephew. -Save
your family spat for later.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.137
Right now we got bigger
problems.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.471
Get the kids.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.044
We know you're in there.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.778
Danny, come on out.
We need to talk.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.647
God. Who did you tell
that you were coming?

33:01.680 --> 33:03.649
-No one. -Well, obviously one of
your friends here did, 'cause...

33:03.682 --> 33:05.951
-Dad, I think...
-Scottie, not now. Please.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.319
I texted a pic of a trophy

33:07.353 --> 33:08.854
Andy tore apart to one friend.

33:08.887 --> 33:10.556
-What? -Oh, Scott.
-He swore he wouldn't

33:10.589 --> 33:12.991
-show anyone. He swore.
-They're seven deep out front.

33:13.025 --> 33:15.727
-Anything around back? -Yeah,
there's four of 'em, and then

33:15.761 --> 33:17.029
more outside the kitchen door.
We're surrounded.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.197
Look, I can get
us through a wall, but

33:18.230 --> 33:19.565
if they
start shooting while we run,

33:19.598 --> 33:21.167
-there's gonna be a fight.
-Run?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.668
-Why should we have to run?
-Didn't you hear them?

33:22.701 --> 33:24.203
-There's an army out there.
-ANDY: Yeah, so what?

33:24.236 --> 33:25.904
-We can take those guys.
-Yeah, of course we can

33:25.937 --> 33:28.307
take them. But we do that,
people are gonna die.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.576
Well, maybe it's time
these people learned.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.144
Andy, you don't mean that.

33:32.178 --> 33:34.846
Yes, I do. Listen to them, Mom.
They hate us.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.082
Just send 'em out
and we'll go away.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.883
I'll go.

33:37.916 --> 33:39.151
It's Chuck Sanders.

33:39.185 --> 33:40.352
Chuck?

33:40.386 --> 33:41.653
I was on swim team with him.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.522
-We went to church. I...
-I know, I know.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.924
I don't think you're quite
understanding how people...

33:45.957 --> 33:47.759
how they feel about all this.

33:47.793 --> 33:48.894
You guys should move.

33:48.927 --> 33:51.097
Come on. Caitie.

33:55.934 --> 33:57.836
Morning, Dan.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.738
Chuck.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.274
The hell you doing?
Who are all these people?

34:02.308 --> 34:04.510
Just a few concerned folks
from the community.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.445
-What do you want? -Come on.
You know why we're here.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.114
-Caitlin and her kids--
they inside? -I don't know

34:08.147 --> 34:09.915
-what you're talking about.
-Cut the crap, Dan.

34:09.948 --> 34:12.050
Rick saw a photo
on his son's phone when they

34:12.084 --> 34:13.752
-got up for swim practice.
-Oh, for God's sake, Chuck,

34:13.785 --> 34:14.853
-come on.
-Your son sent it.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.054
Now, we know they're inside,

34:16.088 --> 34:17.189
so just send 'em out so we don't

34:17.223 --> 34:18.357
have to search the house.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.858
Dan, I know they're family,

34:19.891 --> 34:21.727
but these kids
destroyed half a school.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.429
-We're just trying to keep
everyone safe. -Yeah,

34:23.462 --> 34:24.696
and the $300,000 bounty's
got nothing

34:24.730 --> 34:25.864
to do with it, right, Chuck?

34:25.897 --> 34:27.566
Come on, the only person

34:27.599 --> 34:29.135
in that house is my son, Scott.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.270
Who plays Minecraft
with your son, Jacob,

34:31.303 --> 34:33.972
who's lived down the street from
you since he was six years old.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.107
Chuck, come on, please...

34:35.141 --> 34:36.975
ju... just go.

34:37.008 --> 34:39.978
He's lying, man.
Just go in.

34:40.011 --> 34:41.480
-We didn't come here
for nothing. -Come on, no.

34:41.513 --> 34:42.748
-Sorry, Dan.
-No, Chuck.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.816
Don't!
Wi... Go home!

34:44.850 --> 34:46.218
(grunts)

34:46.252 --> 34:49.621
Aah!
(panting)

34:52.658 --> 34:53.659
Come on, let's go.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.127
Open this door

34:55.161 --> 34:56.528
or we're coming in!

35:10.676 --> 35:12.311
Leave us alone!

35:15.147 --> 35:16.182
Leave us alone.

35:24.890 --> 35:25.891
Hey!

35:28.026 --> 35:30.262
-(sizzles)
-Aah!

35:30.296 --> 35:31.697
Leave it!

35:33.865 --> 35:35.033
Stay behind me.
Get into the car.

35:35.066 --> 35:36.168
-Come on. Come on.
-Back off.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.536
Back off.

35:37.569 --> 35:40.272
-Go. Go. -Come on, come on.
-Danny.

35:40.306 --> 35:42.308
-Go!
-Come on!

35:47.813 --> 35:49.581
Go!

35:52.818 --> 35:54.486
All right, let's go!
Go! Come on!

35:56.087 --> 35:57.823
MAN:
Go, go! Let's go, hurry!

36:08.567 --> 36:10.035
*

36:14.340 --> 36:16.542
It's bad.
We're heading your way.

36:16.575 --> 36:17.843
Hold on, Johnny.
I-I thought you were

36:17.876 --> 36:19.578
-getting the Struckers.
-Yeah, we did.

36:19.611 --> 36:22.348
Things went sideways. We got
the local mutant welcoming group

36:22.381 --> 36:24.049
-on our heels.
-How many?

36:24.082 --> 36:25.851
Eight, maybe ten.
Either way,

36:25.884 --> 36:26.918
we can't afford a fight.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.387
-What do you need?
-A way out of this

36:28.420 --> 36:29.721
doesn't leave any corpses.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.191
(gasps)

36:33.225 --> 36:34.526
DREAMER:
Get back here. I will

36:34.560 --> 36:36.528
figure something out.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.733
Clarice, Clarice.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.935
I need to talk to you.
Johnny-- Thunderbird--

36:43.969 --> 36:45.571
he's in trouble.
They're all in trouble.

36:45.604 --> 36:46.738
-What?
-Look, I...

36:46.772 --> 36:47.739
There's no time to explain.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.040
I need you to make a portal.

36:49.074 --> 36:50.208
Get a car off the road.

36:50.242 --> 36:51.943
A car.
Are you insane?

36:51.977 --> 36:53.979
-You have to.
-I told you, I can't.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.116
You can if you have someone
to care about.

37:03.154 --> 37:05.156
(thunder rumbling)

37:24.576 --> 37:26.778
-What happened?
-Clarice, look at me.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.747
Johnny's in trouble out there,
and I need you

37:28.780 --> 37:31.650
to make a portal.
Can you do it?

37:31.683 --> 37:33.218
Yeah.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.121
Of course.
Where are they?

37:36.154 --> 37:37.356
Are you coming or what?

37:45.364 --> 37:47.065
-(grunts)
-Lauren, can't you shield them?

37:47.098 --> 37:48.434
I can't shield
what I can't see, okay?

37:48.467 --> 37:49.601
Just stay down.

37:56.141 --> 37:57.976
They'll be here any second.
Get ready.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.479
Well, I... I have to be able
to see where I'm portalling to.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.481
-If I can't...
-There. Just get 'em there.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.483
Remember who
you're doing this for.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.518
It's for Johnny.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.131
(grunting)

38:24.002 --> 38:25.371
Where the hell are our people?

38:25.404 --> 38:26.872
You heard Dreamer.
They're working on it.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.273
Not fast enough.
We're getting way too close

38:28.306 --> 38:29.307
to headquarters.
We're gonna have to fight.

38:30.576 --> 38:32.511
(grunting)

38:39.551 --> 38:40.719
(yells)

38:48.193 --> 38:49.495
Look! Look, there!

38:50.696 --> 38:52.731
Go. Go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

39:06.712 --> 39:09.080
-What the...
-You kidding me? -What?

39:09.114 --> 39:12.050
They're gone, man.

39:17.623 --> 39:19.090
-Everybody in one piece?
-Oh, yeah.

39:19.124 --> 39:20.492
Kids, you okay?

39:20.526 --> 39:23.228
-Fine.
-Okay.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.434
Get everybody inside.
I'll be there in a minute.

39:28.467 --> 39:29.801
Okay.

39:33.939 --> 39:35.441
CAITLIN:
You were right.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.178
-I'm sorry.
-That's all right.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.313
You did something stupid
for someone you love.

39:44.149 --> 39:46.151
Can't say I haven't
done the same.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.757
Hey. Are you all right?

39:51.790 --> 39:54.760
Yeah. I'm fine.
We all are.

39:54.793 --> 39:56.027
I can't believe it worked.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.063
I mean, a freaking SUV?

39:58.096 --> 40:01.332
I'm so glad it did.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.707
Go on inside and I'll see you
there in a second.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.141
Yeah.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.177
-Okay.
-Thanks.

40:19.284 --> 40:20.452
What did you do?

40:22.153 --> 40:23.655
You needed help.

40:23.689 --> 40:26.424
She needed something
to connect to, so...

40:26.458 --> 40:28.293
I gave her a memory.

40:28.326 --> 40:29.995
Oh, man.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.930
Of us.

40:33.364 --> 40:35.066
Do you realize what you've done?

40:35.100 --> 40:37.969
What that could lead to?

40:38.003 --> 40:40.005
Believe me, Johnny, I do.

40:50.315 --> 40:52.818
All right, we need
to get the transfer request

40:52.851 --> 40:56.321
over to the deputy director.
ASAP.

40:58.189 --> 41:00.025
(phone rings)

41:00.058 --> 41:01.793
(clears throat)

41:01.827 --> 41:03.629
Turner.

41:03.662 --> 41:06.131
Hello, this is Dr. Roderick
Campbell. Head of research

41:06.164 --> 41:08.800
-over at... -Yeah, I'm-I'm
familiar with your work.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.435
Of course.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.337
I understand
you had a bit of a setback

41:12.370 --> 41:14.606
-last night.
-It happens.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.808
We're moving two prisoners
to a detainment facility.

41:16.842 --> 41:19.144
-We'll get what we need. -Look,
Agent Turner, I'm calling

41:19.177 --> 41:21.647
because I'm quite interested
in this case,

41:21.680 --> 41:23.815
in particular
the Strucker children.

41:23.849 --> 41:26.718
I know your team already
uses some of our resources.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.987
I would like to propose
a partnership of sorts.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.189
You provide me with access
to your suspects,

41:31.222 --> 41:32.658
-and I'll provide you...
-Yeah, we don't

41:32.691 --> 41:34.459
hand our suspects
over to contractors.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.062
I know this is unorthodox,

41:37.095 --> 41:39.464
but I think I could be very
helpful in this investigation.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.232
Listen, I appreciate the offer.

41:41.266 --> 41:43.268
I'm afraid it's out of
the question. Thank you.

41:55.413 --> 41:57.415
*

42:17.769 --> 42:20.071
CAITLIN:
Thanks for meeting me.

42:20.105 --> 42:21.607
Especially after yesterday.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.008
Any time you call,
I'll be there.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.776
But I thought you'd come alone.

42:24.810 --> 42:26.912
It's okay. The mutants
can't bite you from here.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.413
Hmm.

42:28.446 --> 42:30.348
How's your head?

42:30.381 --> 42:33.018
It's fine. Few stitches.
I'll be all right.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.453
Danny, I'm so sorry.

42:35.486 --> 42:36.622
No, no, no.

42:36.655 --> 42:39.190
I'm the one who's sorry.

42:39.224 --> 42:40.792
Look, I was wrong.

42:40.826 --> 42:42.560
Okay?
And I... I want to help.

42:42.594 --> 42:44.395
Mary and I bought a cabin
up in the Smokies.

42:44.429 --> 42:45.697
We never use it.

42:45.731 --> 42:48.066
-Just go.
-And leave my husband?

42:48.099 --> 42:49.768
No. I made some calls.

42:50.802 --> 42:51.903
What?

42:51.937 --> 42:54.072
Reed's alive.

42:54.105 --> 42:56.975
-Oh, my... -Sentinel Services
is taking him to a facility,

42:57.008 --> 42:59.878
along with some woman
from the Underground.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.479
-What kind of facility?
-No one'll say.

43:01.512 --> 43:03.615
Some top-secret mutant
detention center...

43:03.649 --> 43:05.316
But Reed's not a mutant.
Why would-why would would they

43:05.350 --> 43:06.451
-be taking him there?
-I don't-I don't know.

43:06.484 --> 43:07.653
I don't know, and the truth is,

43:07.686 --> 43:08.820
we probably never will.

43:08.854 --> 43:10.889
You have to face the fact

43:10.922 --> 43:12.457
that you're not
gonna see him again.

43:19.130 --> 43:21.232
I love you, Danny.

43:21.266 --> 43:23.702
But you're wrong.
