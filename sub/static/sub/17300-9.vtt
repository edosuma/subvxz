WEBVTT

00:04.341 --> 00:08.163
In tonight's episode: Top family cars.

00:09.700 --> 00:12.464
What is the best hatchback?

00:13.595 --> 00:17.183
Stig happiness his match
opponents on our track.

00:20.357 --> 00:24.893
Good day. As I grew up,
driving children to school was very free.

00:25.143 --> 00:27.652
He just had to rubbing kids in the car

00:28.166 --> 00:31.895
until you can close the door.
Some were jamming

00:31.930 --> 00:35.624
in the ashtray, some were suffocated,
someone is killed in an accident.

00:36.917 --> 00:39.242
Thick children we have put forward, to act

00:39.450 --> 00:42.951
as primitive airbags.
However, at the present time

00:42.986 --> 00:46.417
you would not have thought to put
a child in a car that does not have

00:46.452 --> 00:51.928
airbag personalized with a
monogram and a special belt.

00:51.963 --> 00:55.813
This means that every
child needs its own seat,

00:56.511 --> 01:01.151
which is where one of these: transporter.

01:02.564 --> 01:06.154
This is a new Reno Espas.

01:06.702 --> 01:12.999
The latest version of the car that is at
least in Europe conceived era conveyor.

01:15.931 --> 01:20.533
Like all new Reno, has a strange,
angular, futuristic style,

01:20.568 --> 01:25.686
that hides a strange,
angular, futuristic interior.

01:28.614 --> 01:31.369
But no amount of tricks from Star Trek

01:31.404 --> 01:34.090
can not mask the only function of the car.

01:34.125 --> 01:39.292
To make it as convenient as possible
in the least possible space.

01:43.079 --> 01:46.758
There are countless possibilities
to set up the seats,

01:46.793 --> 01:53.263
The result is that your children and their
friends to travel comfortably and safely.

01:55.054 --> 02:00.762
So, here we are. New Reno Espas. A little
expensive, but the perfect family car.

02:01.395 --> 02:04.410
Except for one thing.

02:04.445 --> 02:07.592
I'd like to now direct your attention to our
"cool wall".

02:07.627 --> 02:11.097
We shared all the cars on the
"to freeze" where the

02:11.132 --> 02:14.533
kola VenkviÅ¡a like, "cool",
"uncool" and "seriously uncool '

02:14.568 --> 02:18.936
where the Beetle, Chrysler PT
Cruiser and the all branded Skoda.

02:20.212 --> 02:25.954
This is several carriers, and they all go under
the "uncool". It does not matter that you have,

02:25.989 --> 02:30.859
New Espas, uncool. Citroen C8, uncool?

02:31.529 --> 02:36.174
Definitely not cool. Seat Alhambra, uncool,

02:36.209 --> 02:40.785
Peugeot 807, uncool, Toyota Previa ...
What is this?

02:40.820 --> 02:46.127
He ... Chrysler Voyager, thanks.
Not cool. What is this?

02:46.162 --> 02:49.996
Hyundai.
What is the name of their transporter?

02:50.031 --> 02:53.831
How? Hyundai, seriously uncool.
You have right.

02:54.708 --> 02:59.169
Kia? Kia Lite. You have right.
What does it matter, I put it there.

02:59.204 --> 03:03.631
You see, the problem is that
the carriers are not normal car.

03:03.666 --> 03:06.110
Normal cola buying because they want to.

03:06.145 --> 03:10.023
These are like containers for washing.
Buying them because you need them.

03:10.058 --> 03:16.996
I perform this here: SUVs. I'll still
have plenty of space, they look cool,

03:17.245 --> 03:20.997
and you will be safe as you
travel to school at Fort Knox.

03:21.789 --> 03:25.454
See what happens when you
collide with a normal 4x4 car.

03:25.489 --> 03:30.761
Look. Regular car was completely destroyed.

03:30.796 --> 03:32.234
You would not want to find yourself in it.

03:32.269 --> 03:35.321
If you want anywhere you are,
then it is a 4x4.

03:35.356 --> 03:39.432
I eto. Big toys "Tonka".
The perfect family car.

03:39.467 --> 03:42.926
Yes. Certainly not this one,
this is the Discovery Channel. Fall apart.

03:42.961 --> 03:46.394
Well, clearly. Look at this.
I close the door, look at the cover.

03:47.339 --> 03:51.864
As a clown car.
More will pop out when you turn on the wings.

03:52.116 --> 03:56.700
So, not that, but this one.
Toyota Land Cruiser.

04:02.235 --> 04:05.464
In wealthier parts of Britain leaves,
Land Cruiser has become

04:05.499 --> 04:11.064
a standard form of school transport.
It has everything you could want.

04:11.099 --> 04:14.757
Toyota's legendary reliability,
the eight seats

04:14.792 --> 04:18.415
and enough room in the
trunk for the cameraman.

04:26.227 --> 04:30.942
This is, however, the new Toyota
Land Cruiser. Basically the same,

04:30.977 --> 04:34.952
Only the bigger,
better looking and better equipped.

04:37.504 --> 04:41.832
It's better to drive.
It is quite advantageous to the big SUV,

04:42.067 --> 04:47.145
if you take a diesel engine,
and you have, it's pretty economical.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:57.310 --> 05:00.869
Inside you have a mix of wood and metal.

05:01.099 --> 05:05.078
There are a lot of switches and navigation

05:05.420 --> 05:10.818
which means that for 36,000
pounds and not a bad price.

05:11.450 --> 05:14.863
And here we are. The new Toyota Land Cruiser.

05:15.177 --> 05:20.073
Cool, strong and reliable.
The perfect family car.

05:20.108 --> 05:23.503
Except for one thing. To discover what it is,

05:23.538 --> 05:29.464
We need to get inside. And what do we find?
To have the gear unit.

05:29.499 --> 05:33.002
This is very useful in the Kalahari desert,

05:33.037 --> 05:36.320
but not necessarily in GUILDFORD.
The same applies to the

05:36.355 --> 05:39.604
adjustment of the suspension
and differential lock.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.692
Basically, you pay a bunch of
things that you will never need.

05:42.991 --> 05:46.675
I perform these here. 4x4 grass and gravel.

05:46.710 --> 05:51.341
BMW X5 and Audi Ol Road.
The point is that these do not

05:51.376 --> 05:57.158
all the field equipment, but does not drag
along tons of redundant technology. Perfect.

05:57.638 --> 06:02.223
Except for one thing.
They have only five seats,

06:02.258 --> 06:05.126
then you can take an ordinary family sedan.

06:05.161 --> 06:08.107
To recapitulate: conveyors are uncool.

06:08.328 --> 06:14.238
The big SUVs, waste,
'grass and gravel "are impractical.

06:14.273 --> 06:17.965
So we're stuck?
-More Not.

06:23.884 --> 06:28.173
This is a new Volvo XC90.
It is so important that we have a car

06:28.384 --> 06:31.120
he had brought from Sweden to see how the

06:31.155 --> 06:33.857
before it goes on sale in Britain.

06:41.359 --> 06:45.320
In many ways it is similar to the BMW X5.
You have AWD,

06:45.355 --> 06:49.282
you have a high driving position,
and that is what you need,

06:49.317 --> 06:54.271
not that you are burdened
with this or that equipment.

06:56.117 --> 06:59.963
This means that the poor
show in the African plains.

06:59.998 --> 07:02.190
Merkati make him laugh.

07:02.225 --> 07:05.956
Scheduled to Arctic and deserted land,
and do not think

07:05.991 --> 07:09.338
they will deliver you from Death Valley.

07:12.042 --> 07:16.047
However, why should we here
in moderately undulating UK,

07:16.082 --> 07:19.391
worried about anything like that?

07:20.044 --> 07:24.909
What is more important is that it is
not here does not work terribly well.

07:25.582 --> 07:31.247
Apparently because the big,
heavy Volvo, not a miracle

07:31.282 --> 07:36.797
which is not sporty.
The ride is bumpy and occupy,

07:37.535 --> 07:42.123
and since it is so high in
corners worn like a giraffe.

07:47.318 --> 07:53.728
There's something else.
Designed in America, it is huge.

07:54.950 --> 07:59.949
It may fall into downtown Houston,
but here in the UK

07:59.984 --> 08:06.052
drive something the size of
city hall minds be daunting.

08:06.257 --> 08:10.342
Threading through the village
street is like an elephant broaching

08:10.377 --> 08:13.606
through the eye of a needle. Enormous said.

08:14.304 --> 08:18.690
Park it in five minutes and
will ask you to pay tax.

08:22.328 --> 08:27.222
I have not finished.
This model has a 2.9-liter 6V

08:27.487 --> 08:31.064
petrol engine with a parallel
turbo engine that consumes fuel.

08:31.099 --> 08:34.030
You will be happy if you spend
a liter of petrol to 5.3 km.

08:34.066 --> 08:37.727
What you really need is diesel.

08:39.078 --> 08:42.230
To sum up then.
Not good for off-road driving,

08:42.265 --> 08:47.022
a huge, thirsty and not very nice to drive.

08:49.550 --> 08:52.871
What's the matter? In order to understand,

08:52.906 --> 08:56.047
I came to Jurassic Park in the Cotswolds.

08:56.082 --> 08:59.154
You see,
this is the place to come as a family,

08:59.189 --> 09:04.382
and believe me, this is the kind
of car that would like to enter.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.145
Let's start from the rear, where we find

09:08.485 --> 09:12.322
Switching the access door that
exists in the Range Rover.

09:12.357 --> 09:16.159
Their advantage is that they
have a place to sit down,

09:16.194 --> 09:19.404
from time to time.

09:19.623 --> 09:24.490
And this is, of course,
the Volvo wagon and rear of him is huge.

09:24.754 --> 09:30.294
It can accommodate a horse,
but will not have a problem with my lizard.

09:30.555 --> 09:34.883
Okay, Sally, out. Get out, come on.

09:35.585 --> 09:41.566
Sally, get out. This is the problem
with Varano. Many are disobedient.

09:41.601 --> 09:47.099
You can not learn anything. He's 17 years old
and does not understand the command "sit".

09:47.134 --> 09:50.810
I'll show you how to operate the seat.
Guys, I'm sorry,

09:50.845 --> 09:54.451
Can you help me? This is a big trunk.

09:54.486 --> 09:58.294
This is a fairly large trunk.
You can insert a crocodile.

09:58.329 --> 10:02.103
No matter which pet you have in mind,
will stand to the back of the Volvo.

10:02.138 --> 10:04.188
Piece of cake.

10:06.310 --> 10:09.051
Well,
we have seen that it is good for lizards,

10:09.086 --> 10:11.792
I'm going to show you how good of people.

10:14.205 --> 10:19.260
Okay. This row of seats is raised like this,

10:19.635 --> 10:23.651
but this here is particularly
smart because it has this lever

10:23.686 --> 10:27.632
which,
when the pull to turn it into a child seat

10:27.667 --> 10:33.506
which can be pulled forward
if the child feels neglected,

10:33.541 --> 10:37.663
is again at the center.
In fact, all of these seats

10:37.698 --> 10:41.773
can be moved back and forth and
that is in itself wonderful,

10:41.992 --> 10:47.417
but he still has tricks up his sleeve,
because beneath the floor of the trunk

10:47.973 --> 10:52.622
there are two seats and did not
stool for occasional seating.

10:52.657 --> 10:57.271
Look,
I have a proper seat belts in three places.

10:57.306 --> 11:00.034
There are plenty of bulkhead
cavities here and here,

11:00.069 --> 11:02.763
You can operate the air
conditioning from the rear.

11:03.027 --> 11:07.800
A look at this,
this allows people who sit in the back

11:08.114 --> 11:11.783
to use headphones while
listening to a CD or watch a DVD,

11:11.818 --> 11:15.745
which is sliding down from the roof,
while the people who sitting in the front,

11:15.780 --> 11:18.617
most adults can listen to Radio 4th

11:18.652 --> 11:21.908
They even have their own
remote control that controls

11:21.943 --> 11:25.164
stereos from the rear. This car is amazing.

11:25.914 --> 11:29.017
I look, even with the rear seats in place,

11:29.052 --> 11:35.803
Drag this to show you that
you still have a decent trunk.

11:36.416 --> 11:42.280
You know, most designers is 26 years old,
wearing a black Rolls

11:42.315 --> 11:48.145
and yellow angular glasses.
Whoever did this have children.

11:54.913 --> 12:02.822
And now the best part. The price. Diesel will
cost 30,000 and 33,000 pounds of gasoline.

12:02.857 --> 12:08.813
This is 12,000 less than the BMW X5.

12:08.848 --> 12:11.514
Not just is not that zakidali the standard.

12:11.549 --> 12:15.192
I have to navigate in the James Bond style

12:15.227 --> 12:19.317
out of the instrument panel.
I have a CD minidisk.

12:19.352 --> 12:23.407
As I was driving through the store,
"Diskons".

12:26.364 --> 12:31.075
They did not zakidali security.
Even those in the back row of seats

12:31.110 --> 12:33.907
have their airbags, but since the auto high

12:33.942 --> 12:36.705
However, the greater the chances that
it will tumble relative to the lower,

12:36.740 --> 12:40.689
the roof is made of specially hardened steel.

12:47.067 --> 12:50.943
Thus, the challenge is one of the
advantages of the high safety.

12:50.978 --> 12:54.820
Is more convenient than
almost all cars on the road.

12:55.129 --> 12:57.378
It is well equipped,
and the price it is good.

12:57.413 --> 13:03.215
Mana he is not good for driving. You choose.

13:08.382 --> 13:12.629
The seats look really fantastic.
Oh, brilliant.

13:12.664 --> 13:16.738
Brilliant design. But driving, how bad?

13:16.773 --> 13:23.185
Well, not bad. Not exactly like X5,
and he feels like a car. This was not.

13:23.220 --> 13:27.117
He feels like a wild animal,
fidgets and turns,

13:27.152 --> 13:29.463
so no, not exactly. Not brilliant ride,

13:29.498 --> 13:31.064
but it's a great car. What is disappointing,

13:31.099 --> 13:34.959
but I generally worried something
else with the 4x4 and whatnot.

13:34.994 --> 13:38.819
Like, I'd take it, I like it as big and tall.

13:38.854 --> 13:41.797
You'd have liked. I can see why you like it.

13:42.385 --> 13:44.209
Yes, I like that. I'm used to,

13:44.244 --> 13:47.569
for you it's a new experience.
Sometimes very scary.

13:48.120 --> 13:52.127
But what worries me, and I got it
and I drive in it with his family

13:52.451 --> 13:55.007
i am constantly on the alert.
It's just that little premonition

13:55.042 --> 13:58.310
which says that I get upset if I
have to change direction rapidly.

13:58.345 --> 14:02.163
High rounds can be overturned,
and the fact, as you said,

14:02.198 --> 14:05.981
have reinforced roof,
no more worrying me, because you

14:06.016 --> 14:08.695
Volvo says: "Yes, it could fall over."
This worries me.

14:08.730 --> 14:10.453
Well, yes. There are two types of security.

14:10.488 --> 14:13.043
There is active security posed by agile auto

14:13.078 --> 14:15.180
in which above all can
not avoid the collision,

14:15.215 --> 14:18.178
and there is a passive safety,
which is what this car has.

14:18.213 --> 14:21.854
They say:
"You can collided" and of course you can.

14:21.889 --> 14:24.030
Accidents happen.
"ZbrinuÄemo this when it happens."

14:24.234 --> 14:27.898
So, if you roll over, which is very possible,
it has reinforced roof,

14:27.933 --> 14:31.563
but as we have seen,
the big car do better in a crash.

14:31.598 --> 14:33.725
Frontal attack,
attack from behind, side impact,

14:33.760 --> 14:36.332
the better you go with this.
Good passive safety.

14:36.367 --> 14:39.845
In simple words,
if I wanted somewhere to put the children,

14:40.469 --> 14:43.670
I'd put them in a car like that.
Because the odds are better.

14:48.457 --> 14:50.719
Well, weight. We pay a lot of
attention to the severity of the show.

14:50.754 --> 14:52.946
We talked about it the other
day in the pub and noticed

14:52.981 --> 14:57.922
the chariot becoming increasingly difficult,
and yet are light was the fastest on the track.

14:58.127 --> 15:01.729
It is clear that it will be slower as
the weight, which consume more fuel

15:01.764 --> 15:03.584
the more it will cost to run.
That's why we thought

15:03.619 --> 15:06.490
What would happen if you were out of
the car pulled out of normal weight

15:06.525 --> 15:09.579
all unnecessary things
to make it more easier?

15:09.887 --> 15:13.616
How much would be faster? We had to find out.

15:13.651 --> 15:16.361
Because of the unique way in
which the BBC is funded, we get

15:16.396 --> 15:19.342
budget of 500 pounds and obtain this.

15:19.377 --> 15:25.707
Yes, it's a Jaguar XJS in 1985, with a V12
engine capacity of 5.3 liters and 300 hp.

15:25.975 --> 15:32.726
Previously we gave Stig who 0-100 km /
h developed for impressive 8.6 seconds.

15:48.407 --> 15:51.450
This car has not been slow for its time,
and still is very fast.

15:51.485 --> 15:54.234
But what would happen
if we put him on a diet?

15:54.269 --> 15:57.663
Will it be faster if we take as much cargo?

15:57.698 --> 16:01.058
Consequently, there is this team. The
guys from Cornwall, and this is your place

16:01.445 --> 16:05.645
and you will understand them better.
-PrevodiÄu If the going gets tough.

16:05.680 --> 16:10.217
It will be useful. Would you tell them to start that quarterback?
-Naval.

16:13.930 --> 16:19.409
Well, we'll see how it will look like, but now we have a problem.
-Go on.

16:19.681 --> 16:24.286
Stig says he does not want to drive,
because he wants to promote

16:24.321 --> 16:27.745
your CD. He has recorded a CD,
a kind of light the Christmas hits

16:27.780 --> 16:31.833
i want to promote it,
but we told him, "This is the BBC,

16:31.868 --> 16:35.895
can not you promoviÅ¡eÅ¡, "but even.
-Nadrndani Stig.

16:35.930 --> 16:39.923
But, let me turn to the news,
some producers worry about it.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.199
Since Christmas,
there is no novelty this week,

16:44.662 --> 16:46.515
but we will have something to talk about.

16:46.550 --> 16:51.693
The most important is that you know Jacques Cousteau
opened a representative office in the English Channel.

16:57.995 --> 17:01.400
This is the ship that sank. How, 3,000 cars?
-Yes.

17:01.435 --> 17:06.353
What is interesting,
mainly BMW and free you know

17:06.387 --> 17:11.523
it is a BMW's board. He entered the
channel did not look left or right ...

17:12.569 --> 17:16.231
And a big shock. Two ships collide.
That's gotta hurt.

17:16.266 --> 17:19.648
Then tone and accession to the bottom.
Another strong shock.

17:19.684 --> 17:22.816
3,000 cars,
as they did not activate the air bags?

17:22.851 --> 17:26.622
Because then it would just surfaced.

17:28.276 --> 17:32.769
Of course, now lying on the bottom,
Spanish fishermen ...

17:33.486 --> 17:37.518
You know what was coming.
Since their coastline destroyed oil,

17:37.553 --> 17:41.551
will come right into the English
Channel to get hooked to BMW 318th

17:42.053 --> 17:46.167
And not all of BMW, there were Sabova.
This'm going to throw.

17:46.202 --> 17:49.785
9.3? Kud just to catch one in
which not enough investments.

17:49.820 --> 17:53.334
The real disaster for Volvo
XC90 that we just saw.

17:53.369 --> 17:57.651
Great car. They make only 50,000 per year,
which is already not enough,

17:57.686 --> 18:01.869
on board there were 350.
It's not that so? Yes, sank.

18:01.904 --> 18:05.084
350?
-Yes. It will be worse. -Zamislite The conversation.

18:05.119 --> 18:09.201
"Where's my car? Well, hop on to Jacques."

18:09.462 --> 18:12.472
If you want XC90 scoot to northern Spain.

18:12.507 --> 18:15.482
Few have been damaged,
but they all ended up there.

18:16.866 --> 18:20.424
Morgan.
Again they went to race, which is good news,

18:20.459 --> 18:23.584
but obviously it is a costly business.
Coming recession.

18:23.619 --> 18:28.127
Here the car at Le Mans. This is an
expensive game and sponsors are hard to find.

18:28.162 --> 18:32.601
They worked out how to raise a couple
of quid. The best I can explain

18:32.636 --> 18:37.644
If you remember the club Bino.
Have you been members? I guess I'm just me.

18:39.270 --> 18:45.117
I remember him, the membership fee was 5
pence, giving the male membership cards.

18:45.758 --> 18:49.999
So he and Morgan started
the club that you can join.

18:50.034 --> 18:53.184
It's a little more expensive than five pence,
costs 1,000 pounds.

18:54.041 --> 18:58.449
Yes, but for that money you get ...
And that helps? This is a sponsorship?

18:58.484 --> 19:03.180
Yes. All those people who give
1,000 pounds that go trotting race.

19:03.215 --> 19:07.877
For that money, you ride on the track and
watch the race, and when you get there,

19:07.912 --> 19:12.999
get-to-door and seat in the lodge.
-Head office? -Yes.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.756
What headquarters? Probably plastic, red.

19:15.791 --> 19:20.345
Not tron? That's what I wanted
to 1,000 pounds. With tiger fur.

19:21.032 --> 19:25.470
I umbrella.
And half-naked girls with Fiji to me cool.

19:25.505 --> 19:29.719
It does not say anything about it, but
they put you on the list of those who gave

19:29.999 --> 19:34.185
more than 1,000 pounds, have private
access to the team, and since the race

19:34.220 --> 19:38.969
lasts 24 hours, will be on the track ...
-45 minutes. -Something like that.

19:39.004 --> 19:41.608
23 hours to im bored when you go wrong.

19:41.643 --> 19:46.113
Do you have access to a club, a tree house?

19:46.316 --> 19:48.839
To come up and talk about the Morgans?
-Unfortunately no,

19:48.874 --> 19:52.861
or you can buy clothes that are
limited products. Yeah you buy?

19:52.896 --> 19:56.849
It's a little too expensive. Maybe I will not.
-I Found myself a perfect investment.

19:57.319 --> 20:03.578
House in the south of France, which is
now on sale. Here she is. Beautiful house.

20:04.167 --> 20:08.625
And at the foot of your race track.

20:09.388 --> 20:14.888
I kid you not, there is an entire track.
-Every House should have one.

20:14.923 --> 20:18.834
Look at this. It's all yours.
As if someone would complain.

20:18.869 --> 20:21.693
Jeremy, how much does it cost?
-9 Million.

20:21.728 --> 20:25.528
And it's a little more expensive. That's
according to the current exchange rate of 40p.

20:26.626 --> 20:30.825
But to me this is the best story.
Better than Cousteau stores.

20:32.435 --> 20:36.634
O motorcyclists Leon Humphreys
who was brought to trial

20:36.669 --> 20:41.236
because I forgot to say that
his Suzuki was out of the way.

20:41.661 --> 20:50.816
He claims that after the medieval law has the right to settle the fight.
-That!

20:51.966 --> 20:55.838
He says that according to medieval
law which is still in force

20:55.873 --> 20:59.534
has the right to fight with the
champion who will be appointed

20:59.569 --> 21:02.421
Agency to issue drivers'
licenses and traffic.

21:02.456 --> 21:04.848
Champion AIVSD?
-Just so. In Swansea.

21:04.883 --> 21:10.061
All will want.
- "Do you like to fly? I'll show him."

21:10.096 --> 21:15.393
Only AIVSD must take into account
that this is a fight to the death.

21:15.428 --> 21:20.822
Just strictly.
Can you use a sword, knives and hammers.

21:20.857 --> 21:26.217
This is a good TV program.
This is something I'd like to watch.

21:26.599 --> 21:30.730
And that's the end of the news,
but we have a little treat.

21:30.765 --> 21:36.484
Look what we have here.
It is a new MG SV and to the model

21:36.519 --> 21:42.203
MG Rover, after which he left BMW alone. Yay.

21:42.638 --> 21:48.744
Of course, MG models were previously
optional bit with the tires.

21:49.781 --> 21:54.905
This is a little different.
When Oliver Reed and Russell Crowe lead

21:54.940 --> 22:00.030
Wild male love scene on the set
of angry fighting in "Gladiator"

22:00.065 --> 22:05.131
This would be the result.
This is the result of something significant.

22:05.166 --> 22:09.110
Is there somewhere to hang
up the helmet of the city.

22:09.145 --> 22:13.714
No, really has a rear bracket for the helmet.
Would you like to hear?

22:13.749 --> 22:18.142
Yes? The sound of thunder V8 engine.
We're all a bit previous

22:18.177 --> 22:22.466
Sunday evenings. Here we go.
Combat readiness to third

22:22.780 --> 22:25.645
Turn and shoot.

22:33.511 --> 22:38.954
The model will go on sale next year
at a cost of 60,000, or a little more

22:38.989 --> 22:43.155
if you like nitrous-powered 1000 hp.

22:43.190 --> 22:47.082
Of course he will, is not it? Simply want.

22:48.009 --> 22:51.418
Very very nice. It is clear that
it will not make a family version.

22:51.903 --> 22:56.025
No, a family man was convicted of
driving Volvo-like former normal,

22:56.380 --> 22:59.946
be henpecked and it goes to the beige color.

22:59.981 --> 23:03.512
Or you can take a car like that.
Subaru Forester.

23:20.674 --> 23:24.569
It's annoying, is not it? Remember the
'80s as they were two decades ago

23:24.604 --> 23:26.649
i can not remember how you manage a fast car

23:26.684 --> 23:30.405
Only by feeling through the bottom,
but you would probably be able to continue,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.014
if you were able to put the butt on the seat.

23:34.049 --> 23:37.332
This could be a nice fit in your life.

23:37.367 --> 23:40.581
No house, but a car. New Subaru Forester.

23:40.616 --> 23:44.043
What at first glance seems
like a heavenly family car.

23:44.078 --> 23:47.435
There are quite a large trunk
with plenty of storage space

23:47.470 --> 23:53.171
for everything you need right now,
such as children, books, apples.

23:54.364 --> 23:59.461
Visible is raised that nothing
expensively avoid damage underneath.

24:00.211 --> 24:04.235
It has everything you need. A ume this.

24:20.697 --> 24:26.275
Without a doubt, just off the family man.

24:37.958 --> 24:42.286
There Imprecinu chassis,
Imprecin turbo, drive components

24:42.321 --> 24:46.929
and motor strength 177 hp at 5,600 rpm.

24:46.964 --> 24:51.393
Develops 0-100 km / h in 7.9 seconds,
has a constant drive to all 4 wheels

24:51.428 --> 24:55.091
differential and limited travel. you should

24:55.126 --> 24:58.755
to just push on to break it. The law is.

25:06.834 --> 25:10.400
This is extraordinary.
This is a turbo Imprecin

25:10.435 --> 25:13.931
platform forward and a baby seat in the back.

25:13.966 --> 25:20.503
Uses many parts turbos to be no
problem to put Imprecin emblem over.

25:22.846 --> 25:26.327
However,
real-life offers advantages over Impreca.

25:26.362 --> 25:29.149
Spacious in the back.
The trunk is much larger,

25:29.184 --> 25:31.927
but children will look
forward to further heights.

25:37.742 --> 25:41.861
If you were old enough when
they first appeared compacts,

25:41.896 --> 25:45.981
Now probably worry about weight.
And Subaru worried about my weight,

25:46.244 --> 25:50.036
but they are more concerned
about how to deploy.

25:51.205 --> 25:54.221
That Forester has Imprecin motor is good news

25:54.256 --> 25:58.980
not only in terms of power.
The engine is horizontal in-line 4-cylinder,

25:59.015 --> 26:01.939
which means that the
ratio of a low and set up,

26:01.974 --> 26:06.873
which in turn maintains a low center of
gravity and makes it easier to manage.

26:14.001 --> 26:18.652
This means that the winner on all surfaces.

26:19.366 --> 26:26.370
For many SUVs say they are good on the road,
but honestly, they are not. This is.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.719
The ride is smoother and more
comfortable than many cars

26:31.754 --> 26:35.038
made only for road use. low center of gravity

26:35.073 --> 26:38.146
helps to avoid instability SUV.

26:38.181 --> 26:42.189
Civilized, but does not lose
the ability to cut off the road.

26:44.123 --> 26:49.857
Mana him that is thirsty,
and the interior is not very decorative,

26:49.892 --> 26:53.095
but again, the previous Forester was really

26:53.328 --> 26:56.530
disgusting inside,
and this is not, which is good.

26:56.565 --> 26:59.697
It is clear that radio
dedicated customer imprecate.

26:59.732 --> 27:03.844
It has a bunch of buttons and
bright as the oil well at night,

27:03.879 --> 27:06.280
but it is extremely loud, which is also good.

27:09.351 --> 27:15.422
So, they put the DNA Impreza
Turbo in the family car and work.

27:15.890 --> 27:17.976
Forester SUV is not intrusive

27:18.011 --> 27:22.079
compared with CRV's,
Frilenderima, RAV4, and the like.

27:22.114 --> 27:28.512
It looks nice, maybe a little quieter,
but believe me, it's really the best of all.

27:31.228 --> 27:33.959
There's something else at Forrester.
Subaru always wins

27:33.994 --> 27:36.656
in those surveys reliability. Quite true.

27:36.691 --> 27:40.192
And that he is in favor of the fact that
doing anything for the benefit of the family.

27:40.227 --> 27:44.346
It is very fast and will not tip over as a high 4x4.
-Just so,

27:44.381 --> 27:47.793
and best of all ... Here's a photo.

27:47.828 --> 27:52.530
Going under the section "cool" on our wall.
-O yes. Cool car.

27:52.907 --> 27:55.725
What do you mean "No"?
-GreÅ¡ite. -Wait.

27:55.760 --> 28:00.347
Have you seen the inside?
-Yes. How boring and dull.

28:00.585 --> 28:04.428
He generally does not get the idea.
What is he spoiled decorator?

28:04.463 --> 28:08.236
This is not the meaning.
-Lorens Llewellyn Bowen without cuffs. It's cool.

28:08.271 --> 28:17.681
TVR?
-Kul! No, you're wrong again. Not cool, and I'll explain why, if I may.

28:18.767 --> 28:23.628
TVR as we know it is for men
who raise their little pants.

28:23.663 --> 28:28.489
You know what age?
-Razmak Between the nipple and waist

28:28.987 --> 28:35.171
slowly starts to decrease.
I'm afraid that's not so cool.

28:35.206 --> 28:41.356
Does anyone else have objections?
-Yes. You again? When you now? Yeah.

28:41.860 --> 28:45.746
Look, it's fine. You can not say
that it is not cool, and the yellow.

28:47.916 --> 28:50.030
Even bananas are.

28:50.263 --> 28:54.017
Does that mean that everything
is cool yellow? It's not.

28:54.052 --> 28:57.737
Speaking of yellow, where's this? Polo. Cool.

28:57.772 --> 29:03.336
The car is cool. No, you're wrong. Kul?
-European Chic. -Evro-Chic?

29:07.050 --> 29:10.135
It's cool.
-Thank you. Very cool. What do you drive?

29:10.170 --> 29:12.572
Jeep Vrengler Sport, but I had a Polo sooner.

29:12.607 --> 29:17.487
Vrengler jeeps were terrible, but cool.
To try to explain.

29:17.522 --> 29:20.994
No matter what kind of
driving or how they look.

29:21.029 --> 29:24.602
It is essential that you are cool or not. Or what color they are.
-Right on.

29:24.637 --> 29:28.175
Look. Do you have a Fiat Punto,
you have the Golf, while gasoline.

29:28.426 --> 29:32.137
Everything is small and European,
Citroen C3, go to a cool section.

29:32.172 --> 29:35.234
Are you sure the M3? I passed by and saw him

29:35.269 --> 29:38.296
and part of me still thinks
that it is in the wrong place.

29:38.331 --> 29:41.072
What do you think. Is the M3 cool enough?

29:41.107 --> 29:45.013
The only way to save is to bring him back.
-Can not.

29:45.048 --> 29:48.754
I'm really not convinced.
Please, return the M3 into place.

29:48.789 --> 29:53.756
It's a great car. Doubtless.
-RaspraviÄemo Later.

29:53.791 --> 29:58.723
He is great. Ferrari 575?
"To freeze"? No, it's ...

29:59.582 --> 30:02.285
Who put this?

30:02.513 --> 30:06.483
Who put the Porsche Boxster in "to freeze"?
You, do not you?

30:07.105 --> 30:12.175
You put because they have it. Well, cool car.
-I Had him.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.839
He stood in the "uncool".
-Well, yes.

30:17.355 --> 30:21.102
No, I drove it last week.
The new Boxster S. It is fantastic.

30:21.584 --> 30:25.590
Great balanced, but you look like an idiot.

30:27.585 --> 30:33.628
It's not so bad. Really.
Do not put the M3 as "cool".

30:34.642 --> 30:38.160
I agreed with you for most,
if anyone support me?

30:38.499 --> 30:42.454
We'll vote. Forget what's driving.

30:43.465 --> 30:47.266
Hands up who thinks it's cool.
Now those who think it's cool.

30:47.301 --> 30:51.479
Right on. More for the "cool".
I won, thank you.

30:51.514 --> 30:56.365
Yes, but not in democracy, but in Totnemu.
You both lose.

30:56.926 --> 30:58.887
You're going to lose. And now...

30:58.922 --> 31:02.497
It is time we put our star in
the car with a reasonable price.

31:02.532 --> 31:05.897
This has its own restaurant.
Three restaurants. From rubber company.

31:05.932 --> 31:09.262
Do you know? Ladies and gentlemen,
the best chef in Britain,

31:09.297 --> 31:13.120
Of course, in addition to Ejnslija Heriot,
Gordon Ramsay!

31:15.759 --> 31:22.230
Hello, Gordon.
-Ejnsli Heriot? He did not cook. -Please? He's a comedian.

31:23.682 --> 31:28.393
Ainsley Harriot is not a chef?
He does not have a restaurant, Jeremy.

31:29.048 --> 31:33.605
He is a comedian and presenter.
-Can You ski dinner for 5 pounds.

31:33.827 --> 31:36.907
He knows that the grill.
-Take The contents of the cans

31:36.942 --> 31:40.724
and bags for table vacuum cleaner,
ski's and 5 pounds can feed

31:40.759 --> 31:44.507
family for a month, and you?
Five pounds only for the parsley.

31:45.644 --> 31:48.857
However, somewhere in between the
opening of 25,000 restaurants,

31:49.560 --> 31:54.658
you managed to make four children.
-Yes. Under 4 years.

31:54.693 --> 31:58.075
All have fewer than four years?
Yes, everyone. Nightmare. What kind of a man.

32:02.095 --> 32:04.086
Look at them.
-Thank you very much.

32:04.121 --> 32:08.911
I appreciate that, so far low.
-Do You have a pillow? -Yes.

32:09.554 --> 32:12.671
Yes, four under four.
What did you take the family car?

32:12.706 --> 32:15.752
Family car has become a problem, Range Rover,

32:15.787 --> 32:18.646
because we could not put all four rear seats,

32:20.219 --> 32:22.273
is Tana got the idea to buy a new Mercedes

32:22.308 --> 32:25.370
and we took one of those from the ML series with six seats.
-Yes.

32:25.405 --> 32:27.781
But he does not have a trunk? Definitely no,

32:27.816 --> 32:33.024
or me these things do not occupy too much.
I do not drive children to school?

32:33.444 --> 32:37.037
I did it once and it was a nightmare.
Excuse me.

32:38.250 --> 32:43.744
8:20 in the morning, driving along
Vontsford Road towards Battersea,

32:44.381 --> 32:49.529
In that time, women, mothers,
do not close the parked car,

32:49.564 --> 32:51.671
longer block the vehicle's closing.

32:51.965 --> 32:55.413
I have to mention one interesting.
A few years ago

32:55.448 --> 32:59.981
I was doing a show about women who drive
their children to school in Chelsea.

33:00.016 --> 33:02.370
I showed up with a film
crew in front of a hopscotch

33:02.405 --> 33:06.061
at Sloane Square.
And when I stopped and fenced?

33:06.096 --> 33:09.683
Mrs. Ramsey. I thought you forgot about it.

33:09.718 --> 33:13.112
Of course I am not.
How could I, it is very attractive.

33:13.147 --> 33:16.506
What is my key to avoid driving to school.
Boys...

33:16.985 --> 33:19.139
Here's what you should do. Tell voluntarily.

33:19.174 --> 33:21.259
Today, I will not drive children to school.
Untie them.

33:21.294 --> 33:24.147
Tomorrow morning they take her back,
but also the day after tomorrow,

33:24.395 --> 33:27.013
and then the fourth morning tell the woman:

33:27.048 --> 33:30.916
"What are the skinny one mother in school,
right?"

33:31.939 --> 33:34.781
I never drove. That's my catch.

33:34.816 --> 33:37.977
Women drivers and vegetarians ...
If we momentarily forgot

33:38.012 --> 33:41.104
tax on traffic congestion and
have alternating driving days,

33:41.139 --> 33:46.064
one for women and one for vegetarians,
London would be heavenly to drive.

33:46.329 --> 33:49.027
How would it look? Do you like the idea?

33:50.668 --> 33:56.710
Are you a vegetarian? Out of the study!
I do not look like a vegetarian.

33:57.948 --> 34:01.940
What are you doing here?
Gardening Fair in hemÅire.

34:03.614 --> 34:05.992
Vegetarians ... I really like this idea.

34:06.027 --> 34:11.364
They drive 25 per hour.
-Vegetarijanci? -Yes. I do not watch the road,

34:11.399 --> 34:13.579
never signaled,
and as soon as a problem arises,

34:13.614 --> 34:17.773
raise their hands off the steering wheel. How
do you recognize that they are vegetarians?

34:17.808 --> 34:20.007
This is something I'd like to know.

34:20.302 --> 34:25.713
That's why they look so to avoid.
-Bledo And exhausted?

34:25.748 --> 34:29.245
As if they needed a good steak.

34:30.074 --> 34:33.460
Speaking of things that
bewilder us on the road,

34:33.985 --> 34:38.042
service stations.
We were all in them. What about food?

34:38.338 --> 34:44.239
Shocking, horrifying mass,
very pathetic, plastic.

34:45.808 --> 34:49.538
I set. Disgusting imitation food.

34:50.282 --> 34:53.277
Before you leave on any trip,
eat before driving.

34:53.532 --> 34:56.087
In fact, no matter how ridiculous it work,
you need to eat before.

34:56.121 --> 34:59.158
Pala us an idea. We said, "just a moment"

34:59.518 --> 35:02.777
ride in cars that have a large hot engine.

35:04.323 --> 35:08.255
Why should not we use for
food storage while we drive?

35:09.165 --> 35:11.453
Therefore, this morning we came to the idea.

35:12.140 --> 35:14.261
Leave the tape.
I'll show you what we came up with.

35:14.296 --> 35:17.495
This is Subaru Forester on which we set motor

35:18.196 --> 35:24.070
juicy slice of turkey breast
with porcini mushrooms, red wine

35:24.105 --> 35:28.411
i garnirali winter shoots,
and what could be tastier than that?

35:28.446 --> 35:31.781
This is Lada,
which we passed put into a Lotus,

35:31.816 --> 35:35.955
but we used it to prepare
lamb ribs with on market

35:35.990 --> 35:40.095
vegetables, seasoned with olive
oil and Mediterranean grasses.

35:40.974 --> 35:45.560
This is Suzuki Liana to
cook wild salmon on lemon

35:45.595 --> 35:50.147
thyme and apples Top Gear.
Vegetarian options.

35:50.909 --> 35:54.887
We recognize and we know that fish
constitutes justifiable homicide,

35:54.922 --> 35:57.894
a meat murder. Really cook on it?

35:57.929 --> 36:00.441
Yeah, it just simmer on
motorbikes while rolling around

36:00.476 --> 36:03.795
and forget about the volume
of gas or oven temperature,

36:03.830 --> 36:06.006
because it will be the measuring unit RPM.

36:06.041 --> 36:09.599
Our recommendation is for
two hours at 3,000 rpm.

36:12.719 --> 36:16.931
After two hours, I stopped a car. Here it is.

36:17.292 --> 36:21.284
Let's look at how we are progressing.

36:23.206 --> 36:25.653
It is still fresh.

36:25.688 --> 36:30.506
I'll add a little spice to try
to hide the smell of motor oil

36:32.288 --> 36:36.588
and bring it back.
This will be the best. Here we go.

36:37.601 --> 36:41.531
Return to the runway or "obrtdÅ¾inicu",
as we call it.

36:43.037 --> 36:49.277
Roughly, we calculated that if
you go from London to Leeds,

36:49.312 --> 36:55.517
Lunch will be finished near Sheffield,
in the amount of service stations Vudal.

36:56.636 --> 37:00.648
So, circulated this morning,
two hours after our path and ...

37:00.683 --> 37:04.660
Is Stig here?
Finally, we allowed him to get out

37:05.002 --> 37:08.555
s cold and left the studio. Bring food.

37:08.590 --> 37:13.657
Here it is. Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time in our study, Stig.

37:23.078 --> 37:27.032
Try some of that salmon
and tell me what you think.

37:27.067 --> 37:31.097
This is then ready for the bike?
-All This food is really

37:31.132 --> 37:33.745
Ready on the motor car.
Tell me if you compete

37:33.780 --> 37:39.097
the food service stations?
Sure compete. Definitely.

37:41.747 --> 37:44.996
This is suvkasto a little browning i ...

37:45.981 --> 37:50.875
Not worth three stars? Two?
I would not give it a ...

37:50.910 --> 37:53.182
One star? I would not give it a one star.
Definitely.

37:53.217 --> 37:57.204
Not even one star?
-Not. Try a little lamb.

37:57.239 --> 38:01.191
Just to remind everyone,
lamb is ready to Ladi.

38:01.226 --> 38:03.962
Vegetables with a drink
seasoned with olive oil

38:03.997 --> 38:07.598
and Mediterranean grasses.
Comrade, this is your kind of food.

38:08.269 --> 38:11.218
What do you think about his food?

38:14.414 --> 38:17.898
I think that Gordon to vomit.

38:18.699 --> 38:23.349
You try a little. Try some shoots.

38:27.483 --> 38:30.582
Even vegetarians like.

38:30.617 --> 38:36.424
It tastes like gasoline, engine oil, grease.

38:36.459 --> 38:40.581
So, ready for the engine.
This is the reason, and this usually happens.

38:40.616 --> 38:45.431
Lamb is unfortunately overdone,
so for two hours at 2,000 rpm is too long.

38:46.562 --> 38:49.750
That's the problem.
We were preparing the cars with four-speed.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.143
Here's a tip. If you save a lamb,

38:52.178 --> 38:55.396
make sure that it is in the car with five,
possibly six-speed.

38:59.249 --> 39:04.969
Okay. Who would like to see Gordon's circle?
Yes, let him.

39:07.452 --> 39:11.165
You seem cheerful.
This is an aggressive start.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.960
This is the most aggressive start
that we saw throughout the series.

39:13.995 --> 39:15.896
Come on, concentrate.

39:16.690 --> 39:19.559
Hell,
I could have sworn I saw a traffic policeman.

39:21.138 --> 39:25.098
That's the whole idea of ââthis route.
Let's see how tightly you hold.

39:25.133 --> 39:30.557
This is the precise ride, pal.
This is a precision driving.

39:34.399 --> 39:36.998
It is approximately 135 km / h and that's it.

39:37.033 --> 39:42.276
KOCIM to 160 and draw. KOCIM, cloth draw.

39:42.311 --> 39:43.754
Too early.

39:45.316 --> 39:49.779
This is where most of them are trips,
or crossed a goal i ..

39:56.642 --> 40:02.831
Gordon R. These are the
times that needs to surpass.

40:02.866 --> 40:06.686
The track was dry,
but should're somewhere near the top.

40:07.128 --> 40:10.021
One minute ...

40:10.056 --> 40:15.250
50 seconds. Same as me, ladies and gentlemen.

40:16.530 --> 40:24.583
Epic lap time.
Of course, I will not put you above me,

40:25.739 --> 40:31.599
It would be impolite. Well alphabetical order. Yes,
the alphabetical order. Yes, the "G" after the "J".

40:32.773 --> 40:36.010
Bar on this panel.
In any case, Gordon Ramsey.

40:36.045 --> 40:39.248
It's totally crazy, thank you for hosting.
-Thank you.

40:47.630 --> 40:52.460
Just we talked about food,
let's see how's Jaguar diet.

40:55.750 --> 40:58.324
In the next three hours,
the team will be removed from Cornwall

40:58.359 --> 41:01.862
any excess fat from our beautiful XJS.

41:01.897 --> 41:04.530
Extraction of the spare wheel,
rear seats, bumpers

41:04.565 --> 41:07.386
and soundproofing.
As they say in the club for weight loss:

41:07.421 --> 41:09.508
"You will not be without pain,
slimmed down to half"

41:09.543 --> 41:12.393
or Jaguar fan, Jason, was not happy.

41:12.428 --> 41:16.262
Dude, this is sacrilege.

41:17.346 --> 41:19.048
Ode towels.

41:22.254 --> 41:25.685
This is motor wiper washer. It all adds up.

41:34.756 --> 41:38.108
All you guys are out of the
school is measured and piled

41:38.143 --> 41:41.446
to a sizable crowd.
-You Are the last bastion

41:41.481 --> 41:44.749
which weighed 20 kg.
The front passenger seat, another 16 kg,

41:45.076 --> 41:50.006
Even speakers who aspired to 6 kg.
-Pepeljara Had 0.27 kg,

41:50.447 --> 41:54.935
but every part of the account and at
the end we came to a total of 223 kg.

41:54.970 --> 41:58.213
It should not make a difference
when we get back on track.

41:58.248 --> 42:01.457
I do not care. Look, you've ruined it.
It was a nice car.

42:01.492 --> 42:03.529
I do not know, it looks better.
Raw and masculine.

42:03.564 --> 42:06.654
Let's get it on track to see
what the Stig do with it.

42:30.535 --> 42:33.981
To recapitulate.
Before we put Jaguar on a diet,

42:34.016 --> 42:37.469
we tested it.
0-100 km / h it took him 8.6 seconds.

42:37.504 --> 42:40.922
Here we put him on a diet,
and remove the fifth tone things

42:40.957 --> 42:43.341
i lost a lot. Almost everything.

42:43.376 --> 42:46.839
We took seats, finishing works,
bumpers, spare tire.

42:46.874 --> 42:49.012
Do not even looking inside,
there is nothing to see.

42:49.895 --> 42:55.404
Then we tested him again.
0-100 km / h in 7.4 seconds.

42:55.439 --> 42:58.098
That's 1.2 seconds faster.
It's really amazing.

42:58.133 --> 43:01.343
No additional power, only with less weight.
Yeah, but if you think

43:01.579 --> 43:04.985
it's fast, what do you think
how much we saved 0-160 km / h?

43:07.415 --> 43:11.854
Five seconds. He was five seconds
faster after it was skinned.

43:11.889 --> 43:14.996
I think this is a great feat.
It is not much, and so we

43:15.031 --> 43:18.104
confirmed their position,
but the weight is not only the enemy

43:18.309 --> 43:21.360
performance, but also thrift. Have more

43:21.395 --> 43:24.377
Fuel lugging all that weight,
that will cost you.

43:24.412 --> 43:28.558
So easy is good,
it is easy to correct and easy to operate.

43:28.789 --> 43:32.858
This week's shopping advice. Now we still
have a few days to the end of the year,

43:33.171 --> 43:35.281
but there is a contract that can be done.

43:35.839 --> 43:38.082
One drawing my attention this week. 4x4.

43:38.117 --> 43:41.366
Nisan says Ikstrejl but still work Teran.
-Yes.

43:41.572 --> 43:43.956
He's good.
-It's Good and has long been in circulation.

43:44.301 --> 43:47.569
Diesel, 2.7 liter, 5-door,
the normal price is 20,000,

43:47.859 --> 43:51.515
but with 15,500 pounds is really a bargain.
Yes, that is reasonable.

43:51.550 --> 43:55.172
That's 4,500 pounds less,
nothing wrong with him, it is a new car.

43:55.207 --> 43:59.996
The new Toyota Avensis.
Like it? It's a nasty car.

44:00.031 --> 44:02.376
Dude, you've got big problems.
-Sramotan Said.

44:02.411 --> 44:05.267
It's not the best car in the world, but ...
It's not the best? Be going out

44:05.302 --> 44:09.354
with labels for a taxi.
It's terrible. Listen, buddy.

44:09.389 --> 44:12.805
There are serious good news for used car.
-I sincerely hope.

44:12.840 --> 44:16.029
Really. There are currently more expensive
than they are worth, but next year

44:16.064 --> 44:19.218
comes a new model at the beginning
of the year, and what will happen

44:19.253 --> 44:21.728
eating advice for the next year.
In January, February,

44:21.975 --> 44:25.095
Dealers will start to
give up on the old lager.

44:25.130 --> 44:27.992
If you are a person who takes
the car and keeps them 4-6 years,

44:28.027 --> 44:30.819
until you raskantaÅ¡,
this is a car that needs to take.

44:30.854 --> 44:33.916
I would Avensis kept longer than five days,
let alone five years.

44:33.951 --> 44:36.650
Buddy,
you can buy it at the beginning of next year,

44:36.685 --> 44:40.298
you'll get a discount on a new car, driven
by 6 years, it will not go to the Toyota.

44:40.333 --> 44:43.912
It's true. And when the time comes to sell it, will keep its price.
-Will it?

44:43.947 --> 44:46.745
Sure, it's a good car. If you buy a new,

44:46.780 --> 44:49.161
you have to accept the fact that you will lose money.
-Yes.

44:49.196 --> 44:52.899
With the only exception of this year, Mini.
Yes, you've already said.

44:52.934 --> 44:55.605
If you're driving 12 months ago, will earn.
predict

44:55.640 --> 44:58.277
that the same will happen
with 2-3 cars next year.

44:58.610 --> 45:02.849
Number one, the BMW Z4.
-Nice car. -FantastiÄan.

45:02.884 --> 45:06.841
Buy it and ride 6-12 months,
and chances are you'll be on sale

45:06.876 --> 45:09.854
or throw or a little steam and make money.
-You mean?

45:10.073 --> 45:13.459
Pins that will be difficult to contain.
-Right on. They will not make enough

45:13.494 --> 45:16.846
However, demand will exceed supply,
as always, and that's an advantage.

45:16.881 --> 45:19.993
Another is a convertible Beetle.

45:21.105 --> 45:24.667
What's up with you?
I know that Buba is not to everyone's taste,

45:24.702 --> 45:27.869
but when thrown convertible,
I think I will have a good effect

45:27.904 --> 45:31.930
the whole brand.
I think the car will hold a fantastic price,

45:31.965 --> 45:35.957
you'll probably make money when you buy.
The third is Nisan 350 Z.

45:36.223 --> 45:39.639
It cost 22,000. Seriously good price.
I appreciate that people will

45:39.844 --> 45:42.316
stand in line to buy the car
when the cool of TT and the like.

45:42.351 --> 45:44.567
This will be the car in which
you'll in my estimation to earn.

45:44.602 --> 45:46.784
If you need more information
about deals that we referred to,

45:46.819 --> 45:52.993
visit our website: bbc.co.uk/top gear

45:57.161 --> 46:00.355
Since this show is dedicated to family cars,

46:00.390 --> 46:03.550
we thought it would be a
good idea to see what's new

46:03.585 --> 46:07.420
and exciting in the world of fast compact.

46:11.365 --> 46:14.969
I've always been a fan of fast compact,
because they are cheap,

46:15.004 --> 46:18.574
free because you can buy two cars for one.

46:19.588 --> 46:22.740
On the one hand they were
practical as each wagon.

46:22.775 --> 46:24.956
They were able to drive
the children to school,

46:25.346 --> 46:27.575
but thanks to their powerful motors,

46:27.610 --> 46:31.275
you could take a ride home as
you burning under their feet.

46:41.244 --> 46:44.986
But lately,
it has become blurred and complicated.

46:45.021 --> 46:52.423
This is the Volkswagen Golf R32,
it cost 22,000 and is not cheap, nor easy.

46:53.565 --> 46:56.874
In addition to the usual security and
exhaust the things that all rounds

46:57.094 --> 46:59.377
today need to have, I have traction control,

46:59.412 --> 47:06.324
control for changing a CD, air conditioning
and heater, which is a control hemorrhoids.

47:07.420 --> 47:11.315
This is all very nice,
but all these luxuries add weight,

47:11.350 --> 47:15.447
so that this car weighs exactly twice

47:15.482 --> 47:19.545
from the original Golf GTI 25 years ago.

47:21.237 --> 47:24.982
Therefore,
it is to be moved faster than cash,

47:25.017 --> 47:28.506
needed twice as powerful motor.
And he got it.

47:28.541 --> 47:34.392
The original volume was 1.6,
and the 3.2-liter.

47:34.684 --> 47:42.407
The original was a strength of 110 hp, and this
develops slightly more than double. 240 hp.

47:43.576 --> 47:47.524
Because it has a stronger, faster,
and the weight of the motor, it resulted

47:47.559 --> 47:51.473
a new problem.
It took him twice as stronger grip.

47:51.745 --> 47:56.946
The original had a front-wheel drive,
and this on all four.

48:11.221 --> 48:16.058
Now you're probably thinking that
I'm going to say it's twice the car.

48:16.093 --> 48:19.893
It is certainly a double solid verbal.
Duplo is luxurious,

48:19.928 --> 48:23.089
half of what was created, double the quieter

48:23.659 --> 48:29.533
while keeping in mind that the original did not
have power steering, double it easier to drive.

48:32.044 --> 48:35.950
But there is no spirit of the original Golf.

48:35.985 --> 48:39.530
Somehow it less fun. As the new Mini.

48:39.565 --> 48:43.645
Better than the original as the car,
but not so significant.

48:52.927 --> 48:56.221
As a historical monument, was destroyed,

48:56.609 --> 49:01.085
but it was quoted as a flying
machine of the 21st century?

49:02.307 --> 49:06.999
On this market,
in the blue corner you have a Ford Focus RS.

49:09.644 --> 49:13.883
In the red corner is the Honda Civic Type R.

49:16.405 --> 49:20.805
And in the yellow corner
of the Seat Leon Cupra R.

49:21.318 --> 49:25.250
This is a world wide tires
and aluminum additives

49:25.285 --> 49:28.590
in which the appearance agrees with quality.

49:34.282 --> 49:41.068
Golf is trying to compete. It has two
exhaust, lower suspension and large wheels,

49:41.346 --> 49:46.624
but somehow it works as a driver
selected in the New Year's party.

49:47.196 --> 49:53.347
Sober and inhibited in the maelstrom
of colorful flags and noise.

50:02.860 --> 50:08.806
R32 is certainly a very, very fast.
0-100 km / h in 6 seconds develops.

50:08.841 --> 50:14.752
Maximum speed is 245 km / h, but my guess
is that before long-distance runner,

50:15.089 --> 50:18.179
hooligan care on the roads of another class.

50:24.089 --> 50:28.646
Motor does not like it revs, the
transmission does not like to hasten slowly,

50:28.681 --> 50:31.720
not a steering wheel does
not like to hasten slowly.

50:31.755 --> 50:35.601
If you're quick on the steering wheel,
you can overtake servo assistance,

50:35.636 --> 50:41.139
and then suddenly everything
becomes difficult, which is strange,

50:42.064 --> 50:46.837
and those who like to spin the
rear end will be disappointed

50:46.872 --> 50:50.594
because you really do not want
to cooperate whatever you do.

51:04.431 --> 51:09.103
I do not know. Not brutal as Ford.
It's actually very soft

51:09.329 --> 51:13.259
and very forgiving.
Think of it more in terms of

51:13.294 --> 51:18.752
long-term companion compared to the
fiery relationship for the night.

51:19.750 --> 51:26.520
And here we are. Oldest of all compacts,
behaves in accordance with his age.

51:27.488 --> 51:31.278
You know what?
I feel like I grew up with the Golf.

51:31.313 --> 51:33.510
I was 17 years old when he appeared Golf GTI.

51:33.545 --> 51:37.932
We have matured together and now we are ...
-Deblji? -Deblji That,

51:38.220 --> 51:42.217
but wiser. A wise head on a large body.

51:43.182 --> 51:45.951
More importantly,
what is compared with direct

51:45.986 --> 51:48.720
competitors, the Ford Focus RS?
Well, we're men.

51:49.068 --> 51:53.703
We have precisely measured.
Therefore, activate the Stig drive.

51:54.212 --> 51:56.499
Ford Focus RS has appeared
here a few weeks ago

51:56.534 --> 52:00.106
and was four seconds faster than
the Subaru Impreza on our track,

52:00.141 --> 52:04.649
but here it is again to the strain
on our track. What is the time?

52:04.849 --> 52:09.689
1:32 PM. How will prove Golf?

52:24.504 --> 52:26.004
<I> Stiga SOUNDS 

52:27.590 --> 52:32.567
Will the four-wheel drive and power
to compete with the Ford Differential?

52:32.971 --> 52:37.433
Exceed the target for 1:33 PM.

52:37.468 --> 52:40.931
It is just seconds behind Ford.
-I know. And this means

52:40.966 --> 52:43.864
it is still three seconds
faster than the Impreza.

52:43.899 --> 52:46.727
It's an amazing car. It really is.

52:46.762 --> 52:51.474
You have to admit that Ford is amazing, but you were reserved.
-Of course.

52:51.509 --> 52:56.122
What Ford seems impossible to
track the front differential

52:56.419 --> 52:59.769
that is useless on the road.
Many twitches and has too

52:59.804 --> 53:03.119
torque, and this ...
Yes, he was a second slower on the track,

53:03.154 --> 53:06.371
The strong point,
but on the way was much more civilized.

53:06.406 --> 53:09.324
This is the car for me.

53:09.359 --> 53:14.971
Approaching the end of the series,
a Westfield XTR is still in

53:15.006 --> 53:17.150
on the top of the table. It was the
fastest car that crossed the circle

53:17.185 --> 53:21.071
on our test track,
but now he was in danger from two sides.

53:21.106 --> 53:24.958
The first is this car.
This is Radikal S3, and like Westfield

53:24.993 --> 53:27.197
motorcycle engine has a
capacity of 1.3 liters,

53:27.232 --> 53:31.491
or in the radical is stronger.
This is a threat.

53:31.838 --> 53:34.687
Then we heard from this guy.
Tom. He contacted us and said:

53:34.722 --> 53:38.120
"I have something that will
dispel all on your test track."

53:38.155 --> 53:39.937
To be honest,
here come the piles of such challenges

53:39.972 --> 53:45.386
and usually it is nonsense,
but this time, a man may be right.

53:49.770 --> 53:52.937
Well, here's Stiga which heats Radicals.

53:53.970 --> 53:58.802
And this is what they will be racing. This
is a super lightweight, super-acrobatic plane

53:59.058 --> 54:02.988
a Tom, Stigov challenger,
the British champion in acrobatic flying.

54:07.063 --> 54:10.845
Since the Stig is not talkative,
I'll be a mediator.

54:11.208 --> 54:14.185
View opponent vehicle. It is SR3 radical.

54:14.220 --> 54:17.163
It is powered by a
motorcycle engine of 1300 cc,

54:17.515 --> 54:21.910
or develops about 200 hp. How is it compared to your plane?
-300.

54:22.360 --> 54:26.072
And this is the amazing part.
Auto weighs 500 kg,

54:26.402 --> 54:29.391
or your plane weighs only 600 kg.
-That's right.

54:29.426 --> 54:31.311
So with the extra weight are pretty equal.

54:31.346 --> 54:35.512
This is the maximum speed of 240 km / h, and your plane?
-320 Km / h.

54:35.550 --> 54:38.263
But although the aircraft would
be faster on the straight line,

54:38.298 --> 54:42.914
Losses speed cornering.
Avion has a wide turning circle,

54:42.949 --> 54:47.530
and our path is very narrow,
so that Tom will have to climb rapidly,

54:47.565 --> 54:50.664
take away the gas and reduces the
speed to stay in the line of the track,

54:50.699 --> 54:53.763
Stig and it will be given priority.
Right here I will have to climb

54:54.053 --> 54:57.885
that would reduce the speed,
so I came back here,

54:57.920 --> 55:02.015
so I'll cover a longer distance,
and here I'm going to cover wider.

55:02.050 --> 55:06.110
Do you think you'll stay close to the track?
Yeah, I think so.

55:07.127 --> 55:09.947
Will this succeed?
-We'll see.

55:09.982 --> 55:12.182
Have you done this before?
-Not. We did not either.

55:19.750 --> 55:22.336
Radikal can develop from
0-100 in 3.5 seconds,

55:22.371 --> 55:26.068
and from 0-160 for 8 seconds,
so you will have an advantage from the start.

55:31.152 --> 55:34.452
Preserves advantage in the first corner,
because when Tom in the summer,

55:34.487 --> 55:38.194
will have to start to climb.
He would have immediately to reduce the gas,

55:38.229 --> 55:41.902
to cross the first corner. Note G force.

55:42.156 --> 55:45.811
Radikal at junctions can achieve 2G.
It is much.

55:45.846 --> 55:48.920
Flights can achieve 9.2 G. Again,
on the flat part

55:48.955 --> 55:51.994
starts catching up with him,
but as he drew near Stig,

55:52.029 --> 55:55.192
must again climb and loses speed.

55:55.426 --> 55:58.458
This means that you can draw,
but that was Stig front.

56:01.654 --> 56:04.305
Both forcing machines to extremes.

56:04.819 --> 56:08.794
Acceleration plane is great,
but every time you approached Stig

56:08.829 --> 56:12.445
must again climb in order to draw the curve.

56:27.875 --> 56:30.701
On the ground are working hard,
but it is nothing compared to what

56:30.736 --> 56:33.711
What Tom has to be repeated. Gushes at Stiga.

56:33.746 --> 56:36.652
We are approaching the end.
At last we have direction.

56:36.687 --> 56:39.108
It seems to me that this has more confidence.
Should...

56:39.143 --> 56:42.028
I evo, who beat the Stig.

56:46.113 --> 56:48.340
But not for long,
because this might be the last line.

56:48.375 --> 56:50.449
This is not the last bend,
there are two more,

56:50.484 --> 56:52.880
which means that Stig
could clear the forehead.

56:52.915 --> 56:55.287
Would it be faster? Avion has to climb high

56:55.322 --> 56:57.659
to lose speed.
This means that Stig progresses.

56:57.904 --> 57:01.390
Will the first to cross the finish line,
or will Tom to come crashing down on him?

57:01.425 --> 57:05.002
I came down and defeated. Stig comes second.

57:18.307 --> 57:21.155
Tom is my new hero. That was really great,

57:21.190 --> 57:23.711
but let's stop for a moment.
He was on the plane.

57:23.746 --> 57:26.233
We have emphasized that
everything that goes on our board

57:26.654 --> 57:30.125
must be legally on the road.
-Yes. You're going on that plane

57:30.160 --> 57:33.561
shopping, the police would stop you.
No signaling,

57:33.596 --> 57:36.982
no stop lights, no brakes.
He's got wings, someone would have noticed.

57:37.017 --> 57:40.369
Can not to park in the center,
because you have caused chaos.

57:40.404 --> 57:43.988
The truth. So, what is important is Radikal.

57:44.424 --> 57:48.605
How did it go?
Here he Westfield XTR, 1:23, Zonda 1:23.

57:48.640 --> 57:52.579
Where will he go?
What do we think? Faster? More?

57:52.923 --> 57:55.843
1:22?
-I'll tell you.

57:56.406 --> 57:59.709
1:19.
