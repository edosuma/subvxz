01:52.245 --> 01:56.148
<i>A security camera films two

01:57.684 --> 01:59.785
And then, all of a sudden, boom!

02:02.755 --> 02:04.857
The street lunges upward.

02:07.527 --> 02:12.431
It happened so suddenly. Giant

<i>[narrator] No deaths were

02:38.759 --> 02:41.326
The scale of this blast
is off the charts.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.828
It came out of nowhere.

02:51.804 --> 02:55.307
<i>[narrator] Former NYPD

and it appears she puts
something on to the ground.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.990
And seconds later,
the entire ground explodes.

03:17.096 --> 03:21.733
<i>[narrator] There had been over 80
terrorist attacks in China since 2010,</i>

<i>a dangerous prank

03:31.145 --> 03:34.213
There's a widespread trend
in China of young children

03:34.215 --> 03:38.350
dropping poppers and other
fireworks down manholes.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.186
<i>[narrator] When the black
powder in fireworks explodes,</i>

03:41.188 --> 03:44.990

03:44.992 --> 03:47.125
<i>The exploding firework can reach</i>

<i>temperatures of
1800 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

03:54.301 --> 03:56.835
<i>the blast wave can be amplified.</i>

03:56.837 --> 04:00.405
Has she just lit a firework and
dropped it down the manhole?

04:03.209 --> 04:06.678
<i>[narrator] But the force of this
blast is far greater than the energy</i>

04:06.680 --> 04:09.615
<i>unleashed by a normal
sewer fireworks prank.</i>

04:09.617 --> 04:12.618
If you look at previous
fireworks explosions,

04:12.620 --> 04:14.620
when it's thrown into a sewer,

04:14.622 --> 04:18.390
the type of explosion you see
typically only lifts the manhole cover,

04:18.392 --> 04:21.293
or creates a small,
localized explosion.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.961
That's not what
were seeing here.

04:26.232 --> 04:29.234
<i>[Connor] The force of
this explosion is incredible.</i>

04:29.236 --> 04:32.304
These planters here,
they're flown into the air

04:32.306 --> 04:34.439
<i>as the explosion erupts.</i>

04:38.177 --> 04:42.381
<i>[narrator] Engineer Brian Wolshon

04:42.383 --> 04:44.650
<i>infesting China's sewers,</i>

04:44.652 --> 04:48.120
<i>a liquid that blights
the lives of its citizens.</i>

04:48.122 --> 04:52.057
So one of the hallmarks of Chinese
cooking, is deep-frying things in oil.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.764
<i>[narrator] In 2018, the Chinese
used over 34 million tons</i>

04:58.766 --> 05:01.400
<i>of vegetable oil over
the course of the year,</i>

05:01.402 --> 05:05.904
<i>to prepare more than
1.4 billion dinners per day.</i>

05:05.906 --> 05:09.241
The Chinese are
known to dump cooking oil

05:09.243 --> 05:11.977
into sewer systems,
down a drain pipe.

05:13.780 --> 05:16.848
<i>[narrator] Cooking oil is
a prized possession in China,</i>

05:16.850 --> 05:20.485
<i>and the demand far
outstrips the supply.</i>

05:20.487 --> 05:25.857
<i>So criminals have turned recycling
into a disgusting money-maker.</i>

05:25.859 --> 05:29.261
Gutter oil is a big
problem in China.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.596
<i>[narrator] This deadly,
second-hand cooking oil,</i>

05:31.598 --> 05:35.133
<i>is harvested from
disease-drenched drains.</i>

05:35.135 --> 05:37.469
So there are criminal gangs

05:37.471 --> 05:40.105
who are actually going
into the sewer system,

05:40.107 --> 05:41.740
collecting this oil,

05:41.742 --> 05:44.843
and then selling it back
to restaurants for use.

05:46.612 --> 05:50.349
<i>[narrator] It's estimated that 10
percent of all cooking oil in China,</i>

05:50.351 --> 05:54.119
<i>is oil that has been scooped
out of the sewers beneath towns</i>

05:54.121 --> 05:57.356
<i>and sold again for reuse.</i>

05:57.358 --> 06:00.625
They'll harvest it, they'll
filter a little bit, strain it,

06:00.627 --> 06:03.562
try to make it to where
it's presentable again.

06:03.564 --> 06:06.098
<i>And then, they'll sell it
back to the restaurants</i>

06:06.100 --> 06:09.167
<i>that probably dumped
it there to begin with.</i>

06:09.169 --> 06:12.404
This is horrendous.
Sloppy goo from the sewer?

06:12.406 --> 06:14.873
Surely, that can't be healthy.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.042
<i>[narrator] This highly
flammable sewer grease</i>

06:17.044 --> 06:20.445
<i>isn't just revolting,
it's a health risk.</i>

06:20.447 --> 06:23.615
Gutter oil often contains
poisons that can cause everything

06:23.617 --> 06:26.385
from diarrhea to abdominal pain.

06:26.387 --> 06:29.087
<i>It's even been linked
to cancer of the colon,</i>

06:29.089 --> 06:32.257
stomach, breast,
kidneys and intestines.

06:33.926 --> 06:37.095
<i>[narrator] The people of China
use over two million tons</i>

06:37.097 --> 06:40.098
<i>of illegal gutter oil in
their cooking every year.</i>

06:41.401 --> 06:44.669
Street food vendors are the
number one consumers of gutter oil,

06:44.671 --> 06:46.138
but they're not the only ones.

06:46.140 --> 06:49.574
Manufacturing facilities,
restaurants, supermarkets,

06:49.576 --> 06:53.011
even school cafeterias have been
known to purchase this product.

06:55.381 --> 06:58.216
<i>[narrator] Gutter oil is such
a health hazard in China,</i>

06:58.218 --> 07:01.553
<i>that the authorities have even
introduced capital punishment</i>

07:01.555 --> 07:06.024
<i>for criminals caught collecting
and selling this slop from the sewers.</i>

07:06.993 --> 07:11.863
<i>In 2014, Zhu Chuanfeng
was sentenced to death</i>

07:11.865 --> 07:15.000
<i>for masterminding
a gutter oil empire</i>

07:15.002 --> 07:17.636
<i>that netted him over $4 million.</i>

07:19.772 --> 07:22.574
<i>Criminals fearing the firing
squad are now deterred</i>

07:22.576 --> 07:25.377
<i>from scooping out
filthy fat from the sewers.</i>

07:25.379 --> 07:30.282
<i>But this has simply created a new, explosive
headache for the Chinese authorities.</i>

07:30.284 --> 07:33.885
The Chinese people are
walking on ticking time bombs.

<i>[narrator] Coming up, the ultimate

<i>[narrator] In China, two young

<i>that's been poured
down the city's drains.</i>

08:22.936 --> 08:26.705
A reality of the modern era
is the fatberg.

08:29.008 --> 08:32.611
The idea that you get
a big buildup of fat

08:32.613 --> 08:35.714
<i>from cooking fats that have
been dumped in the sewer system,</i>

08:35.716 --> 08:39.584

<i>This fetid mass of fat, oil,

<i>is over 200 yards long, and

<i>It takes nine

09:06.412 --> 09:08.613
<i>Now, these greasy
monsters are growing</i>

09:08.615 --> 09:11.516
<i>right beneath
Chinese citizens' feet.</i>

09:11.518 --> 09:14.753
These big, congealed fatbergs,

09:14.755 --> 09:16.421
<i>they are potentially explosive.</i>

09:18.658 --> 09:22.928
<i>[narrator] Fatbergs contain cooking
oil, methane and hydrogen sulfide,</i>

09:22.930 --> 09:25.130
<i>a potent cocktail

09:25.132 --> 09:28.500
<i>a fat-ferno, if
ignited by fireworks.</i>

09:28.502 --> 09:30.802
There's yet another
horror for you to imagine

09:30.804 --> 09:32.804
each night when you lay down
to go to sleep.

09:32.806 --> 09:35.640
What might be beneath

09:43.684 --> 09:47.886
<i>the fireworks prank to end
in such a catastrophe</i>

09:47.888 --> 09:51.456
<i>but China has now told it's
cities to clean up their act,</i>

09:51.458 --> 09:53.758
<i>and decreed that
sewers must be swept,</i>

09:53.760 --> 09:56.595
<i>and their sludge
turned into clean energy,</i>

It looks like there's a stick that's
somehow grown a long coat of white fur.

10:52.786 --> 10:56.688
Trees don't grow fine

11:20.946 --> 11:23.882
<i>This looks like

11:23.884 --> 11:26.384
Sort of, beautifully white

13:29.976 --> 13:32.243
<i>[narrator] And seen
on a highway camera,</i>

13:32.245 --> 13:37.482
<i>a small van crashes,
and over 40 people get out.</i>

13:37.484 --> 13:40.318
How could so many people
fit in the back of one van?

13:49.695 --> 13:51.296
<i>[narrator] In
a Washington forest,</i>

13:51.298 --> 13:56.067
<i>a hiker discovers a tree
covered in mysterious white hair.</i>

13:56.069 --> 13:59.804
<i>And as the white tufts come
into contact with the man's skin,</i>

13:59.806 --> 14:01.806
<i>something strange happens.</i>

14:03.576 --> 14:08.279
It literally melts away at
the touch of his fingers.

14:08.281 --> 14:12.116
<i>[Deborah] This stuff looks like
animal fur, but it doesn't behave like it.</i>

14:12.118 --> 14:15.253
If you touch it, it melts
away into the background.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.259
<i>[Ashanti] As I look a little
bit closer of this branch,</i>

14:21.261 --> 14:25.063
you can see that one end of
this kind of fuzzy, white mass,

14:25.065 --> 14:29.534
<i>is actually attached to the
branch, as if it were growing out.</i>

14:29.536 --> 14:33.671
This is not something
that trees normally do.

14:33.673 --> 14:38.877
<i>This lead me to believe that this
is caused by some sort of fungus.</i>

14:41.347 --> 14:45.049
<i>[narrator] What looks like
strands of hair, is actually ice,</i>

14:45.051 --> 14:48.052
<i>produced by a fungus
slowly attacking the tree.</i>

14:50.256 --> 14:57.195
It's a very rare and unique case
of fungi, <i>called Exidiopsis effusa.</i>

14:57.197 --> 15:00.465
<i>[narrator] The fungus is eating
the tree from the inside out.</i>

15:01.567 --> 15:04.435
<i>This process
produces carbon dioxide,</i>

15:04.437 --> 15:07.238
<i>which forces water
out of the wood.</i>

15:07.240 --> 15:12.110
<i>Normally in cold temperatures,
water would freeze like regular ice.</i>

15:12.112 --> 15:15.280
<i>But the presence of
the Exidiopsis effusa fungus,</i>

15:15.282 --> 15:18.850
<i>causes the water to
freeze into hair-like strands.</i>

15:20.019 --> 15:22.887
<i>These icy strands
are a ghoulish by-product</i>

15:22.889 --> 15:25.823
<i>of the fungus's deadly
battle with the tree.</i>

15:25.825 --> 15:28.927
This tree is a zombie tree,

15:28.929 --> 15:32.263
<i>it's both dead, and alive.</i>

15:32.265 --> 15:35.099
<i>[Jon] The fungus pushes the
moisture out of the rotting wood,</i>

15:35.101 --> 15:37.702
<i>into the atmosphere,
and it freezes.</i>

15:37.704 --> 15:39.270
And as it continues to do this,

15:39.272 --> 15:42.307
the strands of ice
grow longer and longer.

15:43.509 --> 15:46.244
<i>[narrator] As the fungus in
the wood eats its way through,</i>

15:46.246 --> 15:49.447
<i>it releases
recrystallisation inhibitors,</i>

15:49.449 --> 15:51.916
<i>similar to antifreeze proteins,</i>

15:51.918 --> 15:54.485
<i>that keep the hairs
in their unique shape.</i>

15:55.287 --> 15:59.190
<i>The reason for this, a mystery.</i>

15:59.192 --> 16:04.462
<i>But scientists do know fungi have developed
many strategies to lure and consume prey.</i>

16:05.898 --> 16:10.268
Fungi are both clever
and deadly,

16:10.270 --> 16:12.937
<i>and that is a very
dangerous combination.</i>

16:14.039 --> 16:17.342
Given the opportunity,
they'd attack humans as well.

16:19.611 --> 16:22.981
<i>[Kevin] They are linked to
all sorts of medical ailments,</i>

16:22.983 --> 16:26.351
and medical science
is struggling to keep up.

16:26.353 --> 16:30.855
<i>[narrator] Fungal infections kill three
times more people than malaria each year.</i>

16:32.324 --> 16:36.828
<i>In 2019, eight patients
die in British hospitals,</i>

16:36.830 --> 16:42.367
<i>infected with a deadly shape-shifting
fungus called Candida auris.</i>

16:42.369 --> 16:45.903
<i>It was first discovered
in Japan in 2009.</i>

16:45.905 --> 16:48.439
<i>It causes lethal
blood infections,</i>

16:48.441 --> 16:51.109
<i>and has already
spread across the globe</i>

16:51.111 --> 16:55.246
<i>killing half the people who
contract it within 90 days</i>

16:55.248 --> 16:58.750
<i>and it's impervious to most
drugs and disinfectants.</i>

16:59.718 --> 17:03.688
So, fungus is incredibly
lethal to human beings.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.157
<i>[Jon] Fungi cells are
very similar to our own,</i>

17:06.159 --> 17:07.992
so it's very hard
to make medicines

17:07.994 --> 17:11.429
that kill fungal cells without
also killing human cells.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.535
<i>[Ashanti] I've seen some weird
things growing out of trees,</i>

17:17.537 --> 17:19.704
but I've never seen
one growing a beard.

17:19.706 --> 17:22.440
I'm never gonna look at
mushrooms the same way again.

17:28.080 --> 17:32.583
<i>[narrator] Now, a busy highway
on the outskirts of Vienna, Austria.</i>

17:36.789 --> 17:39.390
<i>August 15th, 2015.</i>

17:40.592 --> 17:43.861
<i>A traffic camera records
a regular rush hour.</i>

17:43.863 --> 17:46.431
Okay, so we're seeing some
traffic cam footage here.

17:48.033 --> 17:50.735
<i>- [narrator] When suddenly...
- [tires screeching]</i>

17:50.737 --> 17:52.670
<i>[Jayde] Oh, wow.</i>

17:52.672 --> 17:58.543
Well, that was a big crash, with this
white panel van running into the railing.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.879
Wow, the front end
is totally messed up.

18:01.881 --> 18:06.084
<i>[narrator] The van spins to a stop
right in front of oncoming traffic.</i>

18:06.086 --> 18:09.454
<i>Smoke billows out
of its smashed hood.</i>

18:09.456 --> 18:13.758
Okay, so we can see the driver
gets out of the van.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.027
Well, that's good.
He looks like he's okay. Phew.

18:17.729 --> 18:20.498
<i>[narrator] Then, the side door
slides open.</i>

18:20.500 --> 18:23.468
Look at all those
people filing out of the van.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.136
<i>[narrator] Like
a dam giving way,</i>

18:25.138 --> 18:29.140
<i>a wave of people spills
out onto the blacktop.</i>

18:29.142 --> 18:33.845
[Jayde] Five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

18:33.847 --> 18:36.681
Oh my gosh, how many people
in this van?

18:36.683 --> 18:38.616
There's still more coming out?

18:38.618 --> 18:45.189
I'm counting 12, 13, 14...
It just keeps going.

18:45.191 --> 18:48.593
<i>[Jayde] When you look at
the mass of those people,</i>

18:48.595 --> 18:51.996
compared to
the volume of the van,

18:51.998 --> 18:54.632
<i>there must be some
sort of extra space,</i>

18:54.634 --> 18:58.836
or a trapdoor that
we can't see in the footage.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.239
<i>[narrator] Incredibly,
nearly a minute after</i>

19:01.241 --> 19:05.409
<i>the first person left the stranded
vehicle, they are still coming.</i>

19:05.411 --> 19:09.113
Imagine being one of those
cars stopped beside the van,

19:09.115 --> 19:11.749
you would be absolutely shocked.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.552
<i>[narrator] Over 40 people
emerge from the damaged van</i>

19:14.554 --> 19:17.255
<i>that's designed
to seat just three.</i>

19:17.257 --> 19:21.259
How could so many people fit in the
back of one van, and where are they going?

19:26.365 --> 19:30.668
<i>[narrator] Coming up, were these
captives in transit to a life of hell?</i>

19:30.670 --> 19:34.172
The slave trade unfortunately, is
still very much alive and kicking.

19:35.474 --> 19:38.943
<i>[narrator] And the cable guy
gets the shock of his life.</i>

19:38.945 --> 19:40.511
<i>[Carin] It's a living rope</i>

19:41.513 --> 19:43.648
and it's ravenously hungry.

19:49.755 --> 19:52.390
[tires screeching]

19:52.392 --> 19:56.460
<i>[narrator] In Vienna, Austria, a
small van crashes on the highway...</i>

19:59.531 --> 20:02.066
<i>and over 40 people
spill out on to the road.</i>

20:03.068 --> 20:04.969
<i>[Tracy] So initially when
I saw this clip,</i>

20:04.971 --> 20:07.772
what came to my mind were
clown cars from the circus,

20:07.774 --> 20:10.074
where it's just clown
after clown after clown,

20:10.076 --> 20:11.842
coming out of these small cars.

20:11.844 --> 20:15.213
This scene, with so many
people packed into a small van,

20:15.215 --> 20:16.714
looks like an illusion.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.117
<i>[Tracy] But you can see file
information on the camera,</i>

20:20.119 --> 20:22.920
and it doesn't look like
it's been tampered with.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.356
How could they possibly
have all fit inside?

20:30.596 --> 20:34.065
<i>[narrator] Lots of human
beings can fit into one vehicle.</i>

20:34.067 --> 20:37.168
<i>In 2014, a group of 27 women</i>

20:37.170 --> 20:40.104
<i>managed to fit into
a Mini, in Brighton, England,</i>

20:40.106 --> 20:42.240
<i>- breaking the world record.
- [audience applauding]</i>

20:43.575 --> 20:47.678
<i>A Mini has an internal
capacity of 19 square feet.</i>

20:47.680 --> 20:51.048
<i>The van in the footage
may look significantly larger,</i>

20:51.050 --> 20:54.785
<i>but still has less than
63 square feet of space.</i>

20:56.555 --> 21:00.024
Humans need about 300
square feet to feel comfortable,

21:00.026 --> 21:03.561
but they can survive
in far less space.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.663
<i>[narrator] But the women
in the Mini were crammed in</i>

21:05.665 --> 21:07.898
<i>for just a few
claustrophobic minutes</i>

21:07.900 --> 21:10.568
<i>and the vehicle would never
have been allowed to move,</i>

21:10.570 --> 21:12.670
<i>let alone drive on the highway.</i>

21:14.206 --> 21:17.174
<i>Siobhan Deshauer
suspects the highway footage</i>

21:17.176 --> 21:20.077
<i>shows something
sinister is going on.</i>

21:20.079 --> 21:22.713
<i>[Siobhan] You would never choose
to be crammed in like sardines</i>

21:22.715 --> 21:24.215
<i>into the back of a van.</i>

21:24.217 --> 21:27.518
You can see the driver's
acting in a suspicious way.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.821
<i>At first, he seems to be pacing
back and forth along the van.</i>

21:30.823 --> 21:34.258
Then he grabs something from
inside the van and starts running.

21:34.260 --> 21:37.561
<i>He doesn't seem to be concerned
about his passengers at all.</i>

21:37.563 --> 21:41.799
Could this be some kind of
trafficking operation that's gone wrong?

21:41.801 --> 21:45.136
The slave trade unfortunately, is
still very much alive and kicking.

21:46.705 --> 21:50.274
<i>[narrator] The price of human
life has never been cheaper.</i>

21:50.276 --> 21:53.077
<i>In ancient Rome,
the average price of a slave</i>

21:53.079 --> 21:56.747
<i>cost about $10,000
in modern money.</i>

21:56.749 --> 21:59.984
<i>The average cost of
a 21st century slave,</i>

21:59.986 --> 22:04.355
<i>is just $90, the price
of a pair of jeans.</i>

22:04.357 --> 22:06.924
<i>The number of modern
day slaves in Europe</i>

22:06.926 --> 22:09.226
<i>is one of the highest
in the world.</i>

22:09.228 --> 22:14.899
<i>And highways are the backbone of this
transcontinental trade in human misery.</i>

22:14.901 --> 22:18.903
There's a human trafficking route that
runs from eastern Europe to the Balkans,

22:18.905 --> 22:21.172
and directly into Austria.

22:21.174 --> 22:24.975
<i>Could these people be on
their way to a life of forced labor?</i>

22:27.646 --> 22:30.247
<i>[narrator] If their final
destination is Great Britain,</i>

22:30.249 --> 22:32.616
<i>then the answer could be yes.</i>

22:32.618 --> 22:36.520
<i>Over 10,000 people
live as slaves in the UK,</i>

22:36.522 --> 22:39.190
<i>with the number
rising every year.</i>

22:39.192 --> 22:41.258
The people behind this
are disgusting parasites.

22:41.260 --> 22:44.495
They're feeding off of desperate
people hoping for a better life.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.799
<i>[narrator] Great Britain
abolished slavery in 1807,</i>

22:48.801 --> 22:53.838
<i>but two centuries later, shocking
cases continue to be found.</i>

22:53.840 --> 23:00.010
A traveler family in Britain kept
18 people as slaves for 25 years.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.012
A lot of these people
are actually homeless

23:02.014 --> 23:04.215
and they were promised
food, accommodations,

23:04.217 --> 23:06.684
in exchange for
a few months of work.

23:06.686 --> 23:09.153
<i>[narrator] The traveler
family scours the country</i>

23:09.155 --> 23:12.823
<i>and prey on vulnerable
people for their work gangs.</i>

23:12.825 --> 23:17.528
<i>They keep their prisoners in line
with savage beatings and malnutrition.</i>

23:17.530 --> 23:20.731
<i>One man is even forced
to dig his own grave.</i>

23:21.900 --> 23:24.502
They keep them
in squalid conditions,

23:24.504 --> 23:28.406
<i>forcing them to work all day,
every day, for no money.</i>

23:28.408 --> 23:30.574
<i>If they complained,
they were punished.</i>

23:30.576 --> 23:34.145
One man had a concrete
slab thrown in his face.

23:34.147 --> 23:36.514
<i>[narrator] It isn't
much better in America,</i>

23:36.516 --> 23:40.951
<i>where up to 400,000 people are
trafficked into slavery every year</i>

23:40.953 --> 23:44.121
<i>and around 80 percent of them
are women and children.</i>

23:46.024 --> 23:49.593
<i>Sometimes, only the victim's
family come to their rescue.</i>

23:49.595 --> 23:51.228
<i>[Jayde] We've all
seen the movie Taken.</i>

23:51.230 --> 23:55.633
<i>It was a real life case of a 16 year
old girl in Texas that was kidnapped</i>

23:55.635 --> 23:58.569
and would have been forced
into a lifetime of slave labor.

23:58.571 --> 24:01.439
Fortunately, her father pulled
a real life Liam Neeson,

24:01.441 --> 24:04.074
and was able to track
her down and rescue her.

24:04.076 --> 24:08.112
But the reality for a lot of
people is that they're not so lucky.

24:09.247 --> 24:11.148
<i>[narrator] But Chad Orzel
doesn't think</i>

24:11.150 --> 24:13.517
<i>slave trafficking is
what we're seeing here.</i>

24:15.587 --> 24:17.154
<i>[Chad] Looking more
closely at the footage,</i>

24:17.156 --> 24:19.723
we see that the people seem
to be all different ages.

24:19.725 --> 24:22.893
It looks like there are
whole families in there.

24:22.895 --> 24:27.465
<i>Human traffickers prey on
individuals, they would separate families.</i>

24:27.467 --> 24:30.835
So this must be something else.

24:30.837 --> 24:33.737
You know, with world conflict
the way it is around the world,

24:33.739 --> 24:35.739
you've got a lot of refugees
crossing borders.

24:35.741 --> 24:37.575
And they'll do anything
to get across.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.543
<i>And something like this
is the result.</i>

24:39.545 --> 24:41.579
<i>Maybe that's what
we're seeing here.</i>

24:42.447 --> 24:44.648
<i>[narrator] At the end of 2019,</i>

24:44.650 --> 24:48.819
<i>26 million people worldwide
are considered refugees.</i>

24:48.821 --> 24:51.255
They come from warring nations.

24:51.257 --> 24:55.092
Syrians who stay in Syria
risk being blown apart

24:55.094 --> 24:57.761
<i>by relentless bombing campaigns.</i>

24:57.763 --> 25:01.165
People fled Sudan, because
rebels soldiers at any moment

25:01.167 --> 25:04.001
could choose to destroy
their villages.

25:04.003 --> 25:07.204
Travelling in a cramped van
doesn't seem as big a risk

25:07.206 --> 25:09.440
when you know what
you're trying to escape.

25:11.309 --> 25:12.676
[tires screeching]

25:12.678 --> 25:15.246
<i>[narrator] That's until
something goes wrong.</i>

25:15.248 --> 25:19.016
<i>[Jayde] So, this footage
was taken in August of 2015,</i>

25:19.018 --> 25:22.119
<i>and in the same month,
in Austria,</i>

25:22.121 --> 25:25.990
police find another van
with the decomposing bodies

25:25.992 --> 25:29.627
of over 70 people that
were crammed inside there.

25:29.629 --> 25:34.965
Day after day, people die trying to
seek refuge in Europe by land or sea,

25:34.967 --> 25:37.501
but this is one of
the worst cases.

25:37.503 --> 25:39.637
<i>[narrator] The men, women
and children in the footage</i>

25:39.639 --> 25:42.506
<i>could have been cooped
up inside the van for days.</i>

25:42.508 --> 25:45.042
Just imagine if it had been
a worse accident,

25:45.044 --> 25:49.413
all those people could have
been badly injured, if not killed.

25:49.415 --> 25:52.216
[narrator] <i>Following the
crash, the Austrian authorities</i>

25:52.218 --> 25:54.552
<i>take the refugees in
for processing</i>

25:54.554 --> 25:57.621
<i>but they do not reveal their
identities to the public.</i>

25:57.623 --> 26:03.260
<i>To this day, the whereabouts of the
driver who fled the scene remains unknown.</i>

26:03.262 --> 26:07.364
You know, it looks like these
people got away with minor injuries,

26:07.366 --> 26:08.999
but they were lucky
to get out alive.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.769
[tires screeching]

26:17.909 --> 26:21.078
<i>[narrator] Now,
Costa Rica, Central America.</i>

26:25.317 --> 26:27.117
<i>July, 2018.</i>

26:30.188 --> 26:34.091
<i>An electrician is making repairs
to a dilapidated village house</i>

26:34.093 --> 26:36.293
<i>when he sees a mysterious cable.</i>

26:37.729 --> 26:41.165
What appears to be a black
rope or maybe even a wire.

26:43.568 --> 26:47.071
<i>[narrator] When he approaches,
he makes a shocking discovery.</i>

26:49.541 --> 26:50.541
<i>[Shaena] It's moving.</i>

26:51.176 --> 26:52.343
This thing is alive.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.915
I've never seen anything
like that before in my life.

27:00.919 --> 27:03.754
<i>[narrator] This is a cable,
where there's no cable.</i>

27:05.890 --> 27:08.292
This loop is made up of ants.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.294
<i>I think there's thousands
of "em.</i>

27:12.964 --> 27:13.964
Woah!

27:16.067 --> 27:17.968
This is fantastic!

27:17.970 --> 27:20.471
Are ropes supposed
to crawl like that?

27:20.473 --> 27:22.506
On first glance,
it looks like the ants

27:22.508 --> 27:25.509
must be crawling over
something, like a rope.

27:25.511 --> 27:27.711
<i>But when you check
it out more closely,</i>

27:27.713 --> 27:32.249
<i>what you can see is that the ants
are climbing over their own bodies.</i>

27:33.051 --> 27:35.019
The rope is made of ants.

27:36.788 --> 27:39.857
<i>[Greg] It looks like they're
carrying larvae or eggs.</i>

27:39.859 --> 27:41.659
These ants are hunting.

27:41.661 --> 27:46.830
I can see something that looks like
a wasp or a bee nest attached to it.

27:46.832 --> 27:50.300
<i>[narrator] These ants
seem to be defying gravity.</i>

27:50.302 --> 27:54.338
<i>[Greg] How did they get
from one point to the next?</i>

27:54.340 --> 27:56.106
How did these ants build a rope

27:56.108 --> 27:59.610
from the edge of the house
to the wasp's nest,

27:59.612 --> 28:01.311
<i>without anything in between?</i>

28:03.148 --> 28:05.449
How on earth is that created?

28:09.487 --> 28:11.689
<i>[narrator] Coming up,
is this evidence</i>

28:11.691 --> 28:14.825
<i>of an ant species
suddenly getting smarter?</i>

28:14.827 --> 28:18.629
These living bridges usually only
get to be about five inches long.

28:18.631 --> 28:21.799
But this one is
absolutely immense.

28:21.801 --> 28:25.536
<i>It wouldn't surprise me if there
were thousands of ants in this bridge.</i>

28:25.538 --> 28:28.472
<i>[narrator] And a mysterious
black mass</i>

28:28.474 --> 28:30.474
<i>sweeps towards an American town.</i>

28:32.243 --> 28:35.312
Anyone trapped under that
would be charred to a crisp.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.589
[narrator]
<i>In the Costa Rican jungle,</i>

28:45.591 --> 28:50.928
<i>a man films a gravity-defying living
bridge of ants on a feeding frenzy.</i>

28:52.163 --> 28:55.132
<i>Entomologist Kevin Kasky
studies the footage</i>

28:55.134 --> 28:57.534
<i>and identifies the ant species.</i>

28:57.536 --> 29:01.105
I think what we're looking
at is a colony of army ants.

29:03.108 --> 29:05.008
<i>And what's unique
about army ants</i>

29:05.010 --> 29:08.378
is they literally
march in a straight line.

29:08.380 --> 29:11.482
Army ants don't build nests
in the ground like other ants,

29:11.484 --> 29:13.984
instead, they're constantly
on the move.

29:13.986 --> 29:17.621
<i>[narrator] Army ants are half
an inch long and practically blind.</i>

29:17.623 --> 29:22.359
<i>They don't sound like a military
marvel, but size can be deceiving.</i>

29:22.361 --> 29:24.495
Individually, an ant is
not much.

29:24.497 --> 29:28.298
<i>All they do is eat, sleep,
follow the queens orders.</i>

29:28.300 --> 29:34.538
But you put them together,
they form a cohesive megaunit.

29:34.540 --> 29:38.776
<i>[narrator] When ants get together,
they make a gargantuan superorganism.</i>

29:40.478 --> 29:44.381
Some army ant colonies contain
as much as 20 million ants,

29:44.383 --> 29:48.552
all controlled by one
single, autocratic queen.

29:48.554 --> 29:53.023
<i>[narrator] And this single-minded
military machine has no permanent home.</i>

29:53.025 --> 29:56.226
<i>It moves on a relentless
march through the jungle,</i>

29:56.228 --> 29:59.329
<i>foraging like
a miniature Mongol horde.</i>

29:59.331 --> 30:00.998
Anything that
stands in their way

30:01.000 --> 30:03.801
will be overwhelmed
and potentially destroyed.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.969
The hunting parties of army ants

30:05.971 --> 30:09.973
can kill over 500,000
creatures a day.

30:11.509 --> 30:15.445
<i>[narrator] The army ant's main
weapon is their large mandibles</i>

30:15.447 --> 30:19.082
<i>that work like scissors
to slice open their prey.</i>

30:19.084 --> 30:21.051
The bite is very painful,

30:21.053 --> 30:24.154
and because their jaws
are so strong and lock on,

30:24.156 --> 30:26.590
it's very hard to remove them.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.926
<i>[narrator] Even if
the ant body is broken off,</i>

30:28.928 --> 30:32.596
<i>the head will keep biting
down in a death grip.</i>

30:32.598 --> 30:36.667
<i>Army ants are champion
athletes despite their size.</i>

30:36.669 --> 30:40.103
<i>They race across the ground
at over four inches per second.</i>

30:41.239 --> 30:43.373
<i>A human travelling
at the same pace</i>

30:43.375 --> 30:46.109
<i>would be going
at 37 miles per hour.</i>

30:46.111 --> 30:48.412
<i>Most prey can't outrun them.</i>

30:48.414 --> 30:51.014
When they attack,
they swarm over the body,

30:51.016 --> 30:53.016
you may not even
know they're there,

30:53.018 --> 30:56.987
until a signal tells them
to all bite, nearly at once.

31:00.458 --> 31:03.460
And there is no known
way to stop them

31:03.462 --> 31:06.496
once they've started
their attack.

31:06.498 --> 31:09.499
At the same time that they're
cutting and killing the prey,

31:09.501 --> 31:11.602
they're also secreting an acid

31:11.604 --> 31:16.073
which is sort of digesting the
creature outside of the body,

31:16.075 --> 31:18.876
making less work for them,
and leaving more time

31:18.878 --> 31:20.711
<i>for them to move
on to their next kill.</i>

31:22.747 --> 31:26.083
It would take a while for them to
gnaw through your whole body.

31:26.085 --> 31:29.519
But once they get started,
there is no stopping them.

31:29.521 --> 31:32.422
As individuals,
ants are tiny and weak,

31:32.424 --> 31:36.760
but when they band together
like this, they can be deadly.

31:36.762 --> 31:40.564
<i>[narrator] Any creature unable
to evade this army will perish.</i>

31:42.000 --> 31:44.401
Hungry army ants
have been known to devour

31:44.403 --> 31:47.905
<i>cats and dogs locked in houses.</i>

31:47.907 --> 31:52.376
<i>[narrator] Most horrific of all, they
can target small human children.</i>

31:52.378 --> 31:54.811
When a baby was
abandoned in a Russian forest,

31:54.813 --> 31:58.048
<i>she was found covered in ants
being eaten alive.</i>

31:58.050 --> 31:59.716
But luckily, she survived.

31:59.718 --> 32:03.287
This is just horrific. My
skin crawls thinking about it.

32:03.289 --> 32:06.490
<i>[narrator] Even if the colony's
prey is raised up off the ground,</i>

32:06.492 --> 32:09.126
<i>these ants can find
a way to reach it.</i>

32:09.128 --> 32:10.794
When army ants go hunting,

32:10.796 --> 32:13.030
they can use
themselves as bridges

32:13.032 --> 32:17.734
as a way to get over holes or other
obstacles that could be in their way.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.937
They don't plan it,
it's more of an instinct.

32:22.006 --> 32:25.042
When one ant senses a hole
in the ground, it slows down,

32:25.044 --> 32:29.012
but the ant behind it keeps
moving and walks up onto its back.

32:29.014 --> 32:32.816
<i>[narrator] When enough ants have
done this, the living rope gets stronger.</i>

32:32.818 --> 32:36.320
<i>Like scaffolding, it allows
them to climb upwards,</i>

32:36.322 --> 32:38.655
<i>getting closer to
the prey above them.</i>

32:38.657 --> 32:42.292
<i>[Shaena] When an ant feels
another one on its back, it freezes.</i>

32:42.294 --> 32:45.462
The ant on its back sees
the gap and also slows down.

32:45.464 --> 32:49.333
And that process keeps
repeating until there's a bridge.

32:49.335 --> 32:52.669
<i>[narrator] Pulling off such a
feat requires incredible strength.</i>

32:54.238 --> 32:58.008
<i>An ant can carry around
50 times it's body weight,</i>

32:58.010 --> 33:00.444
<i>the equivalent of an average man</i>

33:00.446 --> 33:02.746
<i>carrying two rhinos on his head.</i>

33:04.182 --> 33:08.218
<i>But an ant bridge like this is
one, is an engineering miracle,</i>

33:08.220 --> 33:10.921
<i>even for these
unstoppable creatures.</i>

33:10.923 --> 33:14.591
These living bridges usually only
get to be about five inches long.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.995
But this one is
absolutely immense.

33:17.997 --> 33:21.064
<i>It wouldn't surprise me if there
were thousands of ants in this bridge.</i>

33:23.501 --> 33:26.770
<i>[narrator] Scale analysis of
the Costa Rican ant cable,</i>

33:26.772 --> 33:28.972
<i>shows that it's six feet
in length,</i>

33:28.974 --> 33:32.909
<i>approximately 145 ants long.</i>

33:32.911 --> 33:34.778
<i>That's the equivalent
of replacing</i>

33:34.780 --> 33:38.749
<i>the Rio Grande Gorge
Bridge with a line of people.</i>

33:38.751 --> 33:40.684
The bridge probably
started out much straighter,

33:40.686 --> 33:44.755
but as more ants joined it, it got longer
and heavier and dipped further down.

33:44.757 --> 33:47.457
<i>[narrator] But the incredible
length of this living chain</i>

33:47.459 --> 33:53.130
<i>suggests that the ants maybe
part of a colony of unimaginable size.</i>

33:53.132 --> 33:55.465
There's thousands
of ants in this bridge.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.933
That means that there's probably

33:56.935 --> 33:59.603
millions of other ants in
the colony out there

33:59.605 --> 34:01.371
to make this bridge
worth their time.

34:04.275 --> 34:06.643
<i>I think this could be
an ant super colony.</i>

34:07.678 --> 34:10.981
Usually, ant colonies
only have one queen.

34:10.983 --> 34:13.784
<i>But sometimes, several
colonies will work together</i>

34:13.786 --> 34:14.984
<i>to increase their strength.</i>

34:16.621 --> 34:19.523
<i>[narrator] The ant's main
purpose is to kill and eat</i>

34:19.525 --> 34:23.026
<i>every inhabitant of the nest
that they are entering.</i>

34:23.028 --> 34:24.861
<i>[Kevin] This is terrifying.</i>

34:24.863 --> 34:28.365
<i>If they could build a bridge
that is that long,</i>

34:28.367 --> 34:31.301
think of what they can do if
they build a bridge into my house

34:31.303 --> 34:33.970
or worse yet, your house.

34:33.972 --> 34:38.608
<i>[narrator] There are already over
10,000 trillion ants on our planet.</i>

34:38.610 --> 34:41.978
<i>Their next bridge
could be to your house.</i>

34:41.980 --> 34:44.948
As they start invading
into urban settings,

34:44.950 --> 34:49.419
their numbers increase, and
who's next on the menu? You and I.

34:54.959 --> 34:57.694
<i>[narrator] Now,
Pima County, Arizona.</i>

35:02.200 --> 35:06.069
<i>July 15th, 2020.</i>

<i>A wildlife cameraman hears a strange
noise in a quiet desert landscape.</i>

35:11.543 --> 35:13.643
[liquid gushing]

35:14.812 --> 35:17.047
<i>[narrator] Then, it appears.</i>

35:17.049 --> 35:19.416
[gushing continues]

35:20.785 --> 35:24.354
In the distance, you can see
something rolling towards us.

35:27.525 --> 35:29.259
<i>[Jeff] It's kind of
alien-looking</i>

35:29.261 --> 35:30.961
<i>and it's just
moving really quick.</i>

35:30.963 --> 35:35.599
And it's just, kind of relentlessly
just oozing and pouring.

35:41.606 --> 35:43.573
<i>[Ashanti] This is
the Arizona desert.</i>

35:43.575 --> 35:48.345
Seeing this black fluid rolling over
the parched desert, is so surreal.

35:50.047 --> 35:53.984
<i>[narrator] A mysterious sludge
coating everything in sight.</i>

35:53.986 --> 35:57.988
It looks like an avalanche
of black goo.

35:59.957 --> 36:04.528
What is this sinister black
tsunami and where did it come from?

36:08.332 --> 36:12.903
<i>[narrator] Coming up, a wave
of black death sweeps into town.</i>

36:12.905 --> 36:14.738
You think you're finally safe,

36:14.740 --> 36:17.407
but the worst
could be yet to come.

36:28.286 --> 36:31.621
<i>[narrator] In Arizona,

<i>Journalist Jeff Wise finds reports of weird
black goo appearing all over the world.</i>

36:42.633 --> 36:45.435
There's a similar sort of
black goo

36:45.437 --> 36:47.871
that's been reported
in Caracas, Venezuela.

36:47.873 --> 36:51.308
<i>They call it Le Mancha Negra,
the black stain.</i>

36:54.178 --> 36:59.182
<i>[narrator] The black stain first appears
in 1986 on a road near the airport.</i>

37:00.685 --> 37:04.654
<i>It's small at first. An inch
thick, greasy black blob.</i>

37:04.656 --> 37:06.823
<i>But it slowly spreads to coating</i>

37:06.825 --> 37:09.226
<i>an eight mile
stretch of highway.</i>

37:09.228 --> 37:13.330
The consistency of this goo
changes with the weather.

37:13.332 --> 37:16.900
It's as if hot weather
makes it expand.

37:18.135 --> 37:19.903
<i>[narrator] The black
ooze has been blamed</i>

37:19.905 --> 37:23.073
<i>for numerous traffic
accidents and even deaths.</i>

37:23.075 --> 37:26.176
Although it's very sort of,
oozy, it's also slippery

37:26.178 --> 37:28.578
and that can cause cars to
kind of, spin out of control.

37:30.214 --> 37:31.915
It's so dangerous that

37:31.917 --> 37:36.286
taxi drivers refuse to drive here
when the phenomenon appears.

37:36.288 --> 37:37.887
They don't want to
risk their lives.

37:39.190 --> 37:41.358
<i>[narrator] As the black
ooze spreads,</i>

37:41.360 --> 37:45.328
<i>the Venezuelan government
becomes more desperate to get rid of it.</i>

37:45.330 --> 37:50.133
They try everything, including
pressurized hoses, to try to wash it off,

37:50.135 --> 37:51.768
<i>but nothing works.</i>

37:53.204 --> 37:55.839
They've tried detergents

<i>but that doesn't work either.</i>

37:58.909 --> 38:01.111

38:03.115 --> 38:06.116
but the black goo
continues to return.

To this very day,

It seems like a mixture
of mud and sticks,

but it looks like
it's steaming hot.

38:32.878 --> 38:37.247

<i>[narrator] Local news reports
show that Arizona dealt with</i>

39:15.954 --> 39:20.623
<i>over 2000 wildfires in
the summer of 2020.</i>

39:20.625 --> 39:25.328
<i>Thousands of raging infernos sweep
across swathes of tinder dry forests,</i>

39:25.330 --> 39:27.864
<i>across the American west coast.</i>

39:27.866 --> 39:31.267
<i>They're propelled by winds
of over 60 miles per hour,</i>

39:31.269 --> 39:34.437
<i>making the fires
impossible to outrun.</i>

39:34.439 --> 39:36.306
The remains of
one man were found

39:36.308 --> 39:38.641
in the driver's seat of his car,

39:38.643 --> 39:41.578
<i>with those of his grandmother
sitting next to him.</i>

39:41.580 --> 39:45.215
<i>[narrator] In 2020, more
than 30 people are killed</i>

39:45.217 --> 39:48.685
<i>and tens of thousands are
forced to evacuate their homes.</i>

39:49.887 --> 39:52.555
Many of these fires were
caused by lightning strikes,

39:52.557 --> 39:55.592
but some were set on purpose.

39:55.594 --> 39:58.762
One man claims to have
started a fire in California,

39:58.764 --> 40:01.898
to hide the bodies of
five of his murder victims.

40:03.968 --> 40:06.169
<i>[narrator] On June 5th, 2020,</i>

40:06.171 --> 40:12.275
<i>a devastating fire breaks out in Santa
Catalina mountains in Pima County.</i>

40:12.277 --> 40:15.378
<i>It spreads across
over 100,000 acres</i>

40:15.380 --> 40:18.581
<i>and is still burning on the
day this footage is filmed.</i>

40:20.151 --> 40:23.787
<i>But how could a fire
create a smoking river of goo?</i>

40:24.889 --> 40:26.523
If you look at
the background of the video,

40:26.525 --> 40:28.691
you notice that
the sky is very cloudy.

40:30.194 --> 40:32.896
<i>It's monsoon season
in Arizona so,</i>

40:32.898 --> 40:38.234
lightening, thunder,
and just rain, rain, rain.

40:38.236 --> 40:42.806
<i>[narrator] The July storm that swept
in that day, didn't snuff out the flames,</i>

40:42.808 --> 40:45.642
<i>it merely stirred
up more trouble.</i>

40:45.644 --> 40:50.680
Extreme forest fires can change the
physical nature of the soil below them,

40:50.682 --> 40:52.882
<i>almost creating
a waterproof layer</i>

40:52.884 --> 40:55.351
<i>that liquid just slides
right off of.</i>

40:56.353 --> 40:58.755
This means that even
a light rain can turn into

40:58.757 --> 41:01.291
an aggressive flood
with very little warning.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.963
Large amounts of burnt material

41:06.965 --> 41:10.934
like ash, silt, rocks
and even burnt trees

41:10.936 --> 41:13.369
become loose
and start rolling downhill.

41:15.339 --> 41:19.342
<i>[narrator] In 2018, a forest
fire followed by storms</i>

41:19.344 --> 41:21.878
<i>sends waist high mud
flowing through</i>

41:21.880 --> 41:26.449
<i>California's Santa Barbara
County, at 35 miles per hour.</i>

41:26.451 --> 41:29.552
This water doesn't even behave
like normal water anymore,

41:29.554 --> 41:31.488
it's more like wet cement.

41:32.089 --> 41:33.790
This is a hardcore mudflow.

41:33.792 --> 41:36.192
It picked up trees,
it picked up rocks.

41:36.727 --> 41:37.994
Even picked up cars.

41:38.929 --> 41:40.797
<i>[narrator] 23 people are killed.</i>

41:42.099 --> 41:44.501
<i>The citizens of
Tucson were fortunate</i>

41:44.503 --> 41:47.504
<i>that the killer sludge
didn't hit the town.</i>

41:47.506 --> 41:50.807
<i>Next time,
they may not be so lucky.</i>

41:50.809 --> 41:52.775
As the rate of
wildfires increases,

41:52.777 --> 41:56.012
the risk of these additional
disasters also increases.
