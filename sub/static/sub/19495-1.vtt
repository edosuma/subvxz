01:46.272 --> 01:47.796
Whoa, baby.

02:08.828 --> 02:12.423
It's now officially 8:01, people.

02:12.499 --> 02:13.898
Let's move it!

02:14.934 --> 02:18.165
Come on, come on...
while we're young!

02:19.672 --> 02:21.299
Herbert Jones,
get off my car!

02:28.548 --> 02:30.311
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

02:31.184 --> 02:33.709
Come on. Look lively, people. Come on.

02:35.622 --> 02:38.420
Keep climbing...
you won't get a nosebleed.

02:39.592 --> 02:41.617
Button that up, Carla.

02:48.368 --> 02:52.668
Herbert. Early Bird. Worm.
Think about it.

03:03.283 --> 03:06.343
Pull, Wanda. Pull.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.153
Total destruction.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.383
Any harm?

03:49.229 --> 03:50.457
I don't think so.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.092
Wait... there's a scratch.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.828
Where, here?

04:05.612 --> 04:08.979
People, um, say that acid

04:09.048 --> 04:12.449
causes, um, brain damage.

04:14.854 --> 04:15.946
But, um...

04:17.991 --> 04:20.892
- What did you say?
- Hey, what class do we have now?

04:21.160 --> 04:22.491
Math?

04:31.838 --> 04:32.827
Dude.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.873
There's nobody in here.

04:41.114 --> 04:45.346
Uh... everybody's dead, man.
Nuclear annihilation.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.386
D'Agastino and Barry!

04:47.453 --> 04:49.011
It's alive.

04:49.088 --> 04:53.047
It's precisely 8:26 and you two dopers
are still roaming the halls.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.753
Why aren't you two
at the assembly?

04:54.827 --> 04:57.091
Principal Moss, we've been
lookin' everywhere for you.

04:57.163 --> 04:58.755
What are you talking about?

04:58.831 --> 05:01.265
This guy just
totally trashed your car.

05:03.269 --> 05:04.827
Not my new Buick?

05:04.904 --> 05:06.303
Yeah.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.201
We tried to chase him and everything,
but he got away.

05:12.812 --> 05:16.441
He, um, was wearing
a Billy Joel T-shirt.

05:18.851 --> 05:20.614
Get to the auditorium.

05:31.964 --> 05:33.488
Yes.

05:34.500 --> 05:39.301
Look, even though I'm probably
going to get into Yale,

05:39.372 --> 05:43.240
doesn't mean that I don't suffer
from the effects of teen angst.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.135
But I'm here to tell you

05:45.211 --> 05:49.375
that drugs and alcohol are not
the answers to your problem...

05:52.352 --> 05:55.788
Steve... President Dickhead.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.553
Hey... fuck you, man.

05:59.392 --> 06:00.484
Drugs rule!

06:17.377 --> 06:19.470
Thanks for saving me a seat, Lisa.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.608
Shut up!

06:24.350 --> 06:26.944
Hey, man, what time's that suit
have to be back?

06:28.054 --> 06:31.182
As student body president,
I am proud to bring you

06:31.257 --> 06:33.657
- this special assembly.
- Fuck you, Nisser!

06:33.726 --> 06:34.954
So...

06:35.027 --> 06:38.155
without any further ado,
I give to you,

06:38.231 --> 06:42.463
direct from Salt Lake City,
the music of High On Life.

06:45.838 --> 06:49.569
Hey, there, Fairmount High.
We're High On Life.

06:49.642 --> 06:52.873
Sponsored by the wonderful people
at Bounty Burger.

06:52.945 --> 06:55.243
Get off, you freak!

06:56.983 --> 06:59.611
Now, I know your teen years
can be hard...

06:59.685 --> 07:01.516
Show us your tits!

07:03.656 --> 07:07.148
But just remember,
you're not alone.

07:07.226 --> 07:10.320
We all need a little love
in our hearts.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.296
Hit it, Jojo.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.134
Go away, you suck!

07:20.206 --> 07:24.666
Lift up your fellow man,
lend 'em a helping hand

07:24.744 --> 07:27.474
Put a little love in your heart

07:27.547 --> 07:28.912
They look like Abba.

07:28.981 --> 07:33.680
If you see it's getting late
Oh, please don't hesitate

07:33.753 --> 07:36.620
Put a little love in your heart

07:37.223 --> 07:39.487
This sucks.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.121
We have to save the assembly.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.725
Let's do some Van Damme-age.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.667
Will be a better place

07:50.736 --> 07:52.761
And the world

07:52.839 --> 07:55.137
Will be a better place

07:55.208 --> 07:57.403
For you

07:57.477 --> 07:58.637
And me

08:06.519 --> 08:08.384
- AV man.
- What?

08:08.454 --> 08:10.479
Hey, guys. What's up?

08:10.556 --> 08:15.050
Virus Man, we have to do something
about this lip-syncing shit.

08:15.127 --> 08:17.493
Cool! Whaddya got in mind?

08:21.200 --> 08:22.758
Put a little

08:22.835 --> 08:25.463
Put a little love in your heart

08:26.072 --> 08:28.302
Put a little love...

08:57.803 --> 08:59.771
What is going on here?

09:06.579 --> 09:09.946
Calm down, now.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.813
Let's settle down...

09:19.258 --> 09:20.919
Repent!

09:23.229 --> 09:25.424
Why are you doing this to me?

09:25.498 --> 09:27.898
I only want to help you!

09:32.471 --> 09:35.235
Now, now, now. Calm down.
It's gonna be okay.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.299
Let got of me.
I've gotta get out of here.

09:50.456 --> 09:53.584
What the hell is going on here?!

09:54.794 --> 09:57.285
Superb assembly,
Principal Moss.

09:58.965 --> 10:02.025
A, space.

10:02.101 --> 10:05.264
B, space.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.499
Space.

10:07.573 --> 10:11.100
C, space.

10:11.177 --> 10:14.669
D, space. Space.

10:18.017 --> 10:21.043
Hey! How do you get
this thing to work, man?

10:31.364 --> 10:33.992
I say we're due for another
Senior Class party.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.829
This computer sucks.

10:35.901 --> 10:37.027
Hey, Reggie.

10:39.438 --> 10:42.032
Pretty cool how we
trashed the assembly, huh?

10:42.108 --> 10:43.598
What are you talking about?

10:44.777 --> 10:46.938
Nothing. Nothing.

10:54.420 --> 10:57.218
Um, where are we gonna have it?

10:57.289 --> 10:59.780
How about your
step-monster's place, 'kay?

10:59.859 --> 11:03.693
No, no, no. This calls for something
with a higher degree of difficulty.

11:11.137 --> 11:12.866
Lisa.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.699
- Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.
- What?!

11:16.776 --> 11:18.835
You wanna cut and go to a party?

11:20.312 --> 11:21.438
Come on.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.539
I know you like me.

11:24.717 --> 11:26.014
Would you leave me alone?

11:26.085 --> 11:28.349
I am concerned about you, Lisa.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.082
You're gonna wake up one day

11:30.156 --> 11:33.387
and realize that you wasted all of
your high school years studying.

11:33.459 --> 11:36.189
And you're gonna wake up
and realize you're a loser.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.234
Q...

12:14.800 --> 12:16.768
See you tomorrow, Mr. Bloom.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.034
Go.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.100
Go.

12:25.644 --> 12:26.633
Go.

12:27.313 --> 12:31.613
Don't worry. I'm a professional,
I know exactly what I'm doing. Go.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.618
The cars will stop. Go!

12:37.990 --> 12:38.979
Mom!

12:41.961 --> 12:43.451
They never listen to me.

12:43.529 --> 12:46.225
Fools. Never listen to me.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.558
Never, never...

12:52.071 --> 12:55.802
Hey, dude. You know how to
get to 237 Stratford Road?

12:58.110 --> 13:00.635
Dude, how about Sterling Ridge Lane?

13:02.548 --> 13:03.708
He doesn't know.

13:04.383 --> 13:07.784
What do you mean, he doesn't know?
He's a crossing guard.

13:07.853 --> 13:09.684
Hey, dickhead!

13:09.755 --> 13:12.747
Don't you even know your way
around the neighborhood?

13:13.225 --> 13:15.352
- That's it!
- Go! Go! Go!

13:17.296 --> 13:18.456
Stop!

13:18.531 --> 13:20.294
- Later, psycho.
- Pull over!

13:20.366 --> 13:22.197
Nice job, buddy.

13:23.569 --> 13:25.730
Get a life, loser!

13:25.805 --> 13:28.000
Stop! Stop!

13:28.641 --> 13:29.869
Stop!

13:31.911 --> 13:33.401
I said stop!

13:41.253 --> 13:42.447
Come in.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.924
Yes, Mrs. Winston?

13:46.992 --> 13:48.459
Hello.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.825
Yes?

13:52.965 --> 13:55.399
I forgot why I knocked.

14:00.806 --> 14:04.139
Mrs. Winston, are those cut slips
you're holding?

14:06.512 --> 14:11.176
My late husband once wrote
a little poem called "Little..."

14:12.918 --> 14:16.649
Yeah, must be
another senior skip day.

14:17.890 --> 14:20.723
D'Agastino thinks
he can outsmart me.

14:21.894 --> 14:24.055
Not in <i>my</i> domain.

14:33.105 --> 14:34.094
Hey.

14:49.588 --> 14:50.680
What's up?

14:53.859 --> 14:55.656
Cool party, man.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.288
Oh, I have a mission for you.

14:58.364 --> 15:01.424
You want me to
torch the principal's house, huh?

15:02.902 --> 15:07.532
Okay. But, uh, first,
we need provisions, man.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.440
Oh, okay.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.274
Hey, guys, beer run.

15:22.688 --> 15:26.021
Wouldn't it be cool to screw
in the principal's bedroom?

15:32.131 --> 15:34.691
Uh, hold that thought.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.762
Well, what are you doing here?

15:37.836 --> 15:40.270
This is a senior class party,
isn't it?

15:41.173 --> 15:44.165
- Yeah.
- Well, then I'm in the right place.

15:53.018 --> 15:55.145
What is it, Steve?

15:55.220 --> 15:58.121
Sir, I thought you might
want to take a look at this.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.784
I found it on the floor
of my science class.

16:06.365 --> 16:09.334
"Dags and Reggie invite you

16:09.401 --> 16:12.302
to total destruction."

16:14.139 --> 16:18.439
"Twelve o'clock.
237 Stratford Road."

16:19.845 --> 16:22.040
That's your house, sir.

16:25.184 --> 16:29.086
I know you.
You're that smart girl.

16:30.389 --> 16:32.357
You wanna get high?

16:32.424 --> 16:34.221
No, thank you.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.304
How's it goin', Lisa?

16:49.341 --> 16:52.071
- Are you out of your mind?
- What's the matter?

16:52.144 --> 16:55.705
- This is Principal Moss's house.
- Don't worry about it.

16:55.781 --> 16:58.306
The party's gonna end at 3:00,
we'll clean up, he'll never know.

17:00.319 --> 17:02.617
Miosky! Miosky!

17:07.859 --> 17:09.987
I'm not gettin' busted for this.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.141
Surprise!

17:25.210 --> 17:27.576
Happy birthday.

17:37.823 --> 17:41.554
You think you're so funny,
don't you, D'Agastino?

17:41.627 --> 17:45.256
Well, none of your friends are laughing!
They know you're the reason

17:45.330 --> 17:47.924
they're spending a Saturday
in detention.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.524
It's not my fault.

17:49.601 --> 17:52.570
Well, then who <i>is</i> responsible for
the mess in my house?

17:57.709 --> 17:59.267
The school system.

17:59.344 --> 18:02.006
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

18:02.714 --> 18:05.205
And how is it
the school system's fault?

18:06.285 --> 18:08.185
Well, um...

18:11.323 --> 18:15.123
...the whole reason why I threw the party,
Principal Moss, is because...

18:15.194 --> 18:16.718
We're fed up.

18:16.795 --> 18:18.490
Yeah. We're adults, you know,

18:18.564 --> 18:21.533
and you just keep bombarding us
with your rules.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.400
Stop treating us like kids.
We are fully developed human beings.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.598
You teachers are so out of touch.

18:27.673 --> 18:30.369
We don't need this
"A, space, J, space,

18:30.442 --> 18:33.639
Put A Little Love In Your Heart shit."
We need a challenge.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.480
You guys have to rethink
this whole education thing.

18:36.548 --> 18:39.449
It's just not working.
Now, I'm not saying it's your fault.

18:39.518 --> 18:42.282
I'm not blaming you.
You're just a pawn in the game.

18:42.354 --> 18:45.084
- It's the government, man.
- The government sucks.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.823
Well, uh...

18:48.894 --> 18:53.524
...now that you've enlightened me
as to the real problem here,

18:53.599 --> 18:56.966
perhaps you should tell the President
about your concerns.

18:57.035 --> 19:00.903
In fact, I think you should all
pool your ideas together.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.636
I want you to draft
a 500-word letter to the President

19:04.710 --> 19:07.178
on what you'd like
the government to do

19:07.246 --> 19:10.807
in order to save
our education system.

19:13.452 --> 19:16.444
Now, Mr. Diplo will be
in charge today.

19:16.522 --> 19:19.286
Mr. Diplo, I've given these students
an assignment.

19:19.358 --> 19:22.156
Make sure they finish it by one o'clock.

19:22.227 --> 19:26.527
If they're not finished,
they can stay later.

19:27.399 --> 19:30.391
I know just how to
handle these students, sir.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.201
Okay, lights.

19:33.272 --> 19:36.400
Can you guys keep it down?
I'm trying to write the letter.

19:36.475 --> 19:39.774
Five, four, three,

19:39.845 --> 19:42.541
two, one.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.855
<i>Aw, come on, Susie.</i>
<i>Everybody does it.</i>

19:56.929 --> 19:59.193
<i>I don't know, Fast Eddie.</i>

19:59.264 --> 20:01.994
<i>Don't you think we should</i>
<i>use a prophylactic?</i>

20:05.204 --> 20:07.195
<i>Don't worry.</i>

20:07.272 --> 20:09.502
<i>I'll pull out at the last minute.</i>

20:11.810 --> 20:13.744
Do it! Do it!

20:14.713 --> 20:16.078
Don't do it! No!

20:22.754 --> 20:26.155
- It's <i>my</i> doctor!
- <i>Well, Susie...</i>

20:26.225 --> 20:28.853
<i>... it looks like</i>
<i>you're going to be a mother.</i>

20:31.196 --> 20:33.858
<i>Don't worry, I'll pull out.</i>

20:33.932 --> 20:35.900
<i>Don't worry, I'II...</i>

20:43.375 --> 20:44.842
What happened?

20:44.910 --> 20:46.571
<i>Because of her pregnancy,</i>

20:46.645 --> 20:48.875
<i>Susie was forced</i>
<i>to drop out of school</i>

20:48.947 --> 20:52.781
<i>and never fulfilled her dream</i>
<i>of one day becoming a secretary.</i>

20:52.851 --> 20:54.409
Poor Susie!

20:54.486 --> 20:56.283
<i>So you see, boys and girls,</i>

20:56.355 --> 20:59.688
- <i>teen pregnancy is no joke.</i>
- Four stars. This is great.

21:04.429 --> 21:07.227
<i>Senator, the President</i>
<i>is on the phone.</i>

21:07.299 --> 21:10.325
What does that liberal wuss
want today?

21:13.739 --> 21:15.866
Good morning, Mr. President.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.375
<i>Senator Lerman,</i>
<i>I just finished reading a letter</i>

21:18.443 --> 21:20.274
<i>from some students</i>
<i>from your state</i>

21:20.345 --> 21:22.870
<i>expressing their concern</i>
<i>over our education system.</i>

21:22.948 --> 21:24.381
Uh-huh.

21:24.449 --> 21:27.179
<i>This is one of the most intelligent</i>
<i>letters I've ever read.</i>

21:27.252 --> 21:28.776
Wonderful, sir.

21:28.854 --> 21:32.119
<i>So I think it'd be a terrific idea to</i>
<i>invite these students to Washington</i>

21:32.190 --> 21:33.919
<i>to speak on behalf of my bill.</i>

21:33.992 --> 21:37.155
<i>I want you to fly to Ohio</i>
<i>and give them my personal invitation.</i>

21:37.229 --> 21:39.925
Certainly, Mr. President. I'll leave
first thing in the morning.

21:39.998 --> 21:42.364
<i>I appreciate that, Senator.</i>
<i>Good day.</i>

21:42.434 --> 21:44.493
Good day to you...

21:44.569 --> 21:46.366
...asshole.

21:49.241 --> 21:52.142
"President's education care..."

21:55.180 --> 21:58.377
I appreciate you picking me up
at the train station, Principal Moss.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.214
I'm very excited about
getting the opportunity to teach.

22:01.286 --> 22:05.222
- I really think I can make a difference.
- It's just a typing class, Miss Milford.

22:05.290 --> 22:09.818
Stick to Mr. Bloom's curriculum,
and we'll all get along just fine.

22:10.862 --> 22:12.056
What the fuck?!

22:20.972 --> 22:23.907
- Mrs. Winston, what's going on?
- Hello.

22:24.810 --> 22:28.940
- Why are the police here?
- That's why I came out here.

22:31.116 --> 22:32.105
Yes?

22:32.184 --> 22:35.642
Senator Lerman is visiting
some of the students.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.154
Which students?

22:37.222 --> 22:39.884
D'Agastino and some of his buddies.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.755
Oh, my God!

22:41.827 --> 22:44.728
They're with the press right now.

22:44.796 --> 22:45.922
Where are they?

22:46.732 --> 22:48.063
Where are they?!

22:48.900 --> 22:52.893
Senator Lerman is visiting
some of the students...

22:54.306 --> 22:58.504
I think it's a proud day
for Fairmount high

22:58.577 --> 23:05.676
that the President has asked these
fine, upstanding students

23:05.751 --> 23:08.914
to speak on behalf
of his education reform bill.

23:08.987 --> 23:14.289
We need bright young leaders
for the future of this nation.

23:14.359 --> 23:18.090
Who else is better to comment on this
country's educational problems

23:18.163 --> 23:20.222
than the students themselves?

23:20.298 --> 23:24.325
By golly, I think the President has really
hit a home run on this one!

23:25.303 --> 23:28.898
Is this a bipartisan effort
on behalf of you and the President?

23:28.974 --> 23:32.466
No, no, I...
I cannot take any credit for this.

23:32.544 --> 23:35.104
This is the President's decision.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.671
I had nothing to do
with this whatsoever.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.649
I am only an errand boy.

23:39.718 --> 23:41.948
Now, if that's all, ladies and gentlemen,

23:42.020 --> 23:45.217
I will see you all in Washington.
Buy American.

23:45.290 --> 23:47.383
Senator, one more question!

23:53.698 --> 23:56.292
Senator Lerman,
I'm Principal Moss.

23:56.368 --> 23:59.064
I'm sorry I wasn't at the meeting.
I was picking somebody up.

23:59.137 --> 24:02.300
You just make sure those kids
are down in Washington in two days.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.638
Washington?
They're going to Washington?

24:04.709 --> 24:07.769
That's the plan. They're speaking
on behalf of the President.

24:08.747 --> 24:11.147
May I suggest some other students?

24:11.216 --> 24:13.810
No, sir. Those are the students
who wrote the letter,

24:13.885 --> 24:16.445
those are the students
the President wants...

24:19.124 --> 24:23.151
...and those are the students
our President is going to get.

24:24.429 --> 24:25.828
No excuses.

24:25.897 --> 24:29.697
You get those kids to Washington,
or it's your ass. Got it?

24:32.103 --> 24:34.435
- Yes, sir.
- Have a nice day.

24:39.344 --> 24:41.039
Let's go, son.

24:43.215 --> 24:46.343
Oh, yes, yes.

24:49.588 --> 24:51.419
Frank Hardin, please.

24:52.691 --> 24:56.957
Frank, Lerman here.
Now, listen up, old friend.

24:57.028 --> 25:01.795
The President has just
set himself up for a major downfall.

25:01.867 --> 25:04.199
And I do mean major.

25:04.269 --> 25:08.399
Now, I see this as a perfect opportunity
to make a lot of money.

25:08.473 --> 25:12.136
Would you be interested
in a little proposition?

25:13.144 --> 25:16.443
Great. I'll call you as soon
as I get to Washington.

25:20.385 --> 25:24.082
You boys get off your bikes
and get to class!

25:24.789 --> 25:27.155
Get going!

25:27.225 --> 25:28.419
Scat!

25:29.461 --> 25:30.792
Assholes!

25:33.865 --> 25:36.231
I guess you're wondering
why I asked you here

25:36.301 --> 25:37.928
in the middle of the night.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.532
I need a...

25:46.411 --> 25:49.539
...special favor from you, Steve.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.410
Something that'll be...

25:52.484 --> 25:54.179
...our little secret.

25:54.252 --> 25:55.719
You up to it?

26:01.793 --> 26:03.385
What are you doing?

26:03.461 --> 26:04.894
I thought you...

26:04.963 --> 26:07.397
- I don't want that, you idiot!
- Sorry, sir.

26:08.266 --> 26:11.030
I need a narc
on the trip to Washington.

26:11.102 --> 26:15.232
- What's in it for me?
- How about meeting the President?

26:15.307 --> 26:17.138
The President...

26:17.208 --> 26:19.438
that would almost assure
my acceptance into Yale!

26:19.511 --> 26:20.603
Exactly.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.743
I need you to befriend D'Agastino
and his buddies

26:24.816 --> 26:27.683
and report everything
they do back to me.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.686
You can count on me, sir.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.346
Excellent.

26:31.423 --> 26:35.655
We have to do everything possible to
make sure nothing weird happens.

26:43.501 --> 26:48.097
Captain's log 94237.4.

26:48.173 --> 26:50.733
I've just received
a priority communication

26:50.809 --> 26:52.401
from Starfleet Command

26:52.477 --> 26:55.139
that an alliance between
the Klingons and the Romulans

26:55.213 --> 26:57.841
will occur right here on Earth.

26:59.884 --> 27:03.320
Our mission: to infiltrate
the Klingon crew

27:03.388 --> 27:06.118
and to kidnap the Romulan leader.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.986
Computer, scan file
on Klingon crew.

27:14.132 --> 27:17.033
Computer, identify Klingon leader.

27:21.906 --> 27:24.704
Just as I thought.

27:26.411 --> 27:29.141
Computer, identify
Romulan leader.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.808
Mr. Spock, your analysis?

27:40.025 --> 27:42.550
I agree. We have to stop 'em.

27:44.229 --> 27:48.029
Lieutenant Uhura, accompany me
to the transporter.

27:58.309 --> 28:01.278
Mr. Spock, you have the bridge.

28:05.350 --> 28:09.252
I told the bus company to
have him here at precisely 7:30.

28:16.561 --> 28:17.653
Is that our bus?

28:31.443 --> 28:33.343
You guys going to Washington?

28:33.411 --> 28:34.708
Yeah!

28:34.779 --> 28:36.337
That's the driver?

28:36.414 --> 28:38.974
Name's Red, man.
Sorry I'm late.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.813
We're never gonna make it
to Washington alive.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.079
Come on, hop in.

28:42.153 --> 28:43.620
Hey, let's go!

28:48.026 --> 28:49.084
Shotgun.

28:52.864 --> 28:56.197
Hi. Tracey Milford,
teacher and chaperone.

28:56.267 --> 28:59.327
Well, welcome aboard.
Just grab a seat.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.928
Thank you.

29:01.005 --> 29:03.769
Hey, hold it.
Where do you think you're goin'?

29:03.842 --> 29:05.707
I'm getting on the bus.

29:05.777 --> 29:09.508
You're on the wrong bus, dude.
This is the magic bus.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.573
I'm counting on you
to stick to the schedule.

29:12.650 --> 29:14.550
It's precisely...

29:14.619 --> 29:18.146
...8:06. Let's get going.

29:20.959 --> 29:23.257
Principal Dickhead.

29:24.362 --> 29:26.091
Well, let's rock 'n' roll!

29:31.503 --> 29:33.903
Yeah! Washington!

29:35.740 --> 29:37.799
Shuttlecraft to Enterprise.

29:38.243 --> 29:40.575
Opening shuttle bay doors.

29:48.953 --> 29:51.353
Cloaking device down.

29:54.025 --> 29:58.189
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Shuttlecraft disengage.

30:06.771 --> 30:07.897
Chocolate?

30:09.207 --> 30:11.198
Uh, no, thanks. I'm driving.

30:17.949 --> 30:19.041
No.

30:33.431 --> 30:34.489
Really?

30:45.577 --> 30:46.635
Dags.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.169
Thanks, Virus.

31:10.435 --> 31:11.925
Dags...

31:13.104 --> 31:15.971
I just saw that psycho
crossing guard guy

31:16.040 --> 31:18.338
in a car with Lieutenant Uhura.

31:19.244 --> 31:20.973
Sure, dude.

31:40.164 --> 31:43.395
Mama talkin' to me
tryin' to tell me how to live...

31:51.943 --> 31:53.638
- Hey, Virus.
- Hey.

31:53.711 --> 31:55.702
Let me get your advice on something.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.543
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:57.615 --> 31:58.912
Yeah. Yeah, sure, Dags.

31:58.983 --> 32:01.213
What do you think
about Lisa Perkins?

32:01.286 --> 32:03.777
I mean, she's lookin'
really good, huh?

32:03.855 --> 32:07.951
- Perkins is a head case, man.
- How do you know that?

32:08.860 --> 32:12.489
I did her last year on the Math Club trip.
She want totally psycho on me.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.831
- You did Lisa Perkins?
- Yeah.

32:15.900 --> 32:18.562
But, you know, don't ask her.
She'll just deny it, you know.

32:19.337 --> 32:22.602
- If I were you, I'd go for Meg.
- Meg's gay.

32:22.674 --> 32:26.872
Yeah, but if anyone can change her,
you can, Dags. Yeah!

32:26.945 --> 32:29.880
- I don't think so, Virus.
- You know what I want to do?

32:30.548 --> 32:32.277
- It speaks.
- It speaks.

32:32.850 --> 32:34.317
I want to do a Jap.

32:34.385 --> 32:37.377
Hey, what about Carla Morgan?
I think she's half-Jewish.

32:37.455 --> 32:41.755
Not that kind of Jap.
A real Jap... from China.

32:41.826 --> 32:45.262
With silky-soft skin, almond eyes,

32:45.330 --> 32:47.798
and long, straight, blond hair.

32:47.865 --> 32:50.197
A blond Japanese.

32:53.204 --> 32:56.401
They're a rare breed,
but they're out there...

32:56.474 --> 32:58.408
and I'm gonna find one.

33:09.554 --> 33:11.488
If you all check your itineraries,

33:11.556 --> 33:14.081
you'll see that this is
the only stop we're making

33:14.158 --> 33:16.092
between now and Washington.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.618
So I suggest you take care of
whatever necessities come to mind.

33:19.697 --> 33:21.426
Like takin' a whiz.

33:23.534 --> 33:27.026
Now, I'm setting the alarm
on my watch for ten minutes.

33:27.105 --> 33:29.699
When this alarm goes off
the bus will leave,

33:29.774 --> 33:31.901
with or without you.

33:33.611 --> 33:35.511
Pop quiz, hotshot.

33:35.580 --> 33:39.016
You have ten underage students
craving alcoholic beverages

33:39.083 --> 33:42.484
in a store containing
your high school principal.

33:42.553 --> 33:44.453
What do you do?

33:45.123 --> 33:46.988
What do you do?

33:48.593 --> 33:50.288
Take out the principal.

33:57.435 --> 34:00.598
Hey! I want no trouble from
you people! You hear me? Behave!

34:01.973 --> 34:04.703
I hate when I get blamed for something
before I do anything wrong.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.243
Hey! And you two girls...
what are you doing?

34:08.312 --> 34:10.143
Move away from there!

34:10.214 --> 34:12.148
Hey! Put that down!

34:18.489 --> 34:21.049
The mouse has entered the trap.

34:21.125 --> 34:24.356
- Time?
- Seven minutes and counting.

34:35.005 --> 34:37.998
- Hey, what are you...
- I'm getting my food!

34:38.076 --> 34:39.873
It wasn't my fault!

35:04.836 --> 35:06.133
Damnit!

35:17.281 --> 35:18.509
Okay.

35:37.368 --> 35:41.668
In seventh grade, my Aunt Jennifer
took me aside one day

35:41.739 --> 35:45.641
and she said, "Tracy, one day
you're gonna grow up and be a teacher...

35:45.710 --> 35:47.507
and a darned good one!"

35:50.381 --> 35:53.782
And then in eighth grade...
oh, wow...

36:31.088 --> 36:32.487
Mission accomplished.

36:33.257 --> 36:35.851
- Where's Reggie?
- Bringin' the last load.

36:45.403 --> 36:47.166
Come on, Reggie,
Moss is coming!

36:47.238 --> 36:48.830
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

36:53.878 --> 36:54.867
Sit down.

37:00.484 --> 37:01.712
Open the door.

37:01.786 --> 37:04.584
I'm sorry, man,
we got a schedule to keep.

37:08.993 --> 37:10.187
Open the door!

37:11.128 --> 37:12.993
What's the magic word?

37:13.064 --> 37:15.032
Open the door!

37:15.099 --> 37:17.090
What's the magic word?

37:17.168 --> 37:18.157
Please!

37:20.805 --> 37:23.831
The magic word's
"rock 'n' roll," man.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.813
What happened to you?
Did you piss all over yourself?

37:40.424 --> 37:41.755
Carry on.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.496
Travis.

37:58.976 --> 38:02.343
Yes, Admiral Kirk. I understand.
Travis out.

38:04.248 --> 38:06.113
New orders from Starfleet.

38:06.183 --> 38:09.641
The Klingon leader
is to be terminated.

38:11.055 --> 38:13.717
Phasers on "kill," Lieutenant...

38:13.791 --> 38:15.691
phasers on "kill."

38:35.146 --> 38:38.946
I shall put an end
to your dirty Klingon ways.

39:17.788 --> 39:20.450
Tell me, how you gonna make
my Bounty Burgers richer

39:20.524 --> 39:22.549
with this education care package?

39:22.626 --> 39:26.722
Simple. Once this busload of retards
hit Washington,

39:26.797 --> 39:28.731
the President's gonna look like
such a moron that no one

39:28.799 --> 39:31.131
in their right mind
is going to back his bill.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.669
That's when I introduce

39:32.737 --> 39:35.365
the Senator Lerman
education reform bill.

39:35.439 --> 39:36.804
That's all fine and dandy,

39:36.874 --> 39:39.274
but I could give two diddlies
about education reform.

39:40.611 --> 39:42.909
Frank, what if there was
a clause in my bill

39:42.980 --> 39:46.381
that states that Bounty Burger
is going to replace the cafeterias

39:46.450 --> 39:48.884
in all the public schools?

39:48.953 --> 39:52.411
Bounty Burger in every school
would make me billions.

39:53.090 --> 39:55.058
It's all outlined in here.

40:01.832 --> 40:04.198
What's this gonna cost me, Lerman?

40:05.236 --> 40:09.468
Just a meaningful donation
to my bid for the presidency.

40:10.541 --> 40:14.204
You can look on it
as an investment in America.

40:17.047 --> 40:19.106
Over the river
and through the woods

40:19.183 --> 40:21.583
To Grandmother's house we go,
hey!

40:21.652 --> 40:24.143
The horse knows the way
to carry the sleigh

40:24.221 --> 40:26.155
Through the white
and drifted snow

40:26.223 --> 40:27.383
Hey, look!

40:39.403 --> 40:43.430
'Afternoon. Listen, I'm having
a little car trouble.

40:44.408 --> 40:46.239
Could you give us a lift?

40:46.944 --> 40:48.502
Are you going to the convention?

40:51.615 --> 40:54.209
- Yes.
- So are we.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.411
Climb in.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.631
Are you all right?
You look terrible.

41:10.701 --> 41:14.501
Sometimes I get a little carsick.
I'll be fine.

41:14.572 --> 41:17.564
- Maybe we should pull over.
- No. No pulling over.

41:17.641 --> 41:20.405
I'm not going to
throw us off schedule.

41:21.712 --> 41:23.179
Students!

41:23.247 --> 41:24.509
Students!

41:24.582 --> 41:27.312
Could you please
keep the noise down to a hush?

41:27.384 --> 41:29.875
Principal Moss is feeling very ill.

41:30.921 --> 41:33.287
Puke! Puke! Puke!

41:34.592 --> 41:38.153
I'm not going to be sick,
and we're not stopping the bus.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.461
Principal Moss is gonna puke!

41:42.533 --> 41:44.296
I wish there was something
I could do.

41:44.368 --> 41:47.235
Here, man.
Give him one of these.

41:47.304 --> 41:48.703
What are they?

41:49.540 --> 41:52.338
It's a carsick pill.

41:53.544 --> 41:57.002
- Little large, isn't it?
- Yeah, well, it's, uh...

41:57.081 --> 41:59.072
...it's a bus-sick pill.

42:00.050 --> 42:03.611
Hey, take it, man.
Look, it's all natural. See?

42:06.557 --> 42:07.751
Thank you.

42:12.997 --> 42:15.557
Feeling better already,
aren't you?

42:35.586 --> 42:40.046
Travis to Excelsior.
I have Klingon vessel in sight.

42:40.958 --> 42:43.222
Follow that bus, Mr. Sulu.

42:43.294 --> 42:45.854
Sulu? I'm Mr. Woo.

42:45.930 --> 42:49.093
I see... traitors to the Federation!

42:49.166 --> 42:51.532
- God, no!
- Nobody move!

42:51.602 --> 42:52.728
Hey, don't shoot!

42:52.803 --> 42:55.829
- Is that a Walther PPK semi-automatic?
- Yes.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.469
I'll cover Mom.

42:58.542 --> 43:01.272
Full speed ahead, traitor.

43:13.357 --> 43:15.325
Principal Moss.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.721
Principal Moss.

43:18.796 --> 43:20.593
Principal Moss!

43:21.098 --> 43:22.963
Is he dead?

43:23.033 --> 43:26.127
No, he ain't dead, man.
He's just in a coma.

43:26.203 --> 43:27.397
What?!

43:27.471 --> 43:30.338
I guess that carsick pill's
workin' on him.

43:30.941 --> 43:33.876
It should, man, it's a red.

43:34.845 --> 43:36.506
Horse tranquilizer.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.775
But I saw you take
a handful of them.

43:38.849 --> 43:40.441
They don't work on me, man.

43:40.517 --> 43:42.917
That's why they call me Red...
I'm immune.

43:42.987 --> 43:44.477
You wanna play cards, or what?

43:46.056 --> 43:47.421
Hey!

43:47.491 --> 43:50.824
Moss is in a coma.
Let's party!

43:57.267 --> 43:58.962
Rock 'n' roll!

44:14.351 --> 44:16.216
Heroin, huh?

44:18.255 --> 44:19.517
Insulin.

44:20.057 --> 44:23.117
Can I, like, buy some off you?

44:30.534 --> 44:33.059
Looks like my good qualities
are beating my bad qualities.

44:33.137 --> 44:34.161
Shit!

44:34.238 --> 44:37.071
Oh, hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Calm down. Calm down.

44:38.409 --> 44:41.606
Hey, look. I think It's time
that you and I called a truce.

44:41.679 --> 44:42.771
What do you say?

44:43.814 --> 44:45.281
Cool.

44:45.349 --> 44:47.214
Look, so why don't you
dump your books

44:47.284 --> 44:49.411
and come back
and party with us?

44:50.421 --> 44:52.946
- I can't.
- Why not?

44:53.023 --> 44:54.513
Nobody likes me.

44:54.591 --> 44:57.253
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

44:58.595 --> 45:01.063
Everybody thinks
I'm a frigid head case.

45:02.900 --> 45:05.801
Well, Virus and Reggie do,
but I don't.

45:06.870 --> 45:09.896
Look, you could prove 'em wrong by
coming back and partying with us.

45:12.843 --> 45:14.435
Okay...

45:14.511 --> 45:15.978
I can be fun.

45:17.181 --> 45:18.375
All right.

45:18.449 --> 45:21.509
- Hey, look who's joining us!
- Hi, guys.

45:22.686 --> 45:24.711
Doesn't he look pretty?

45:24.788 --> 45:28.781
Oh, that's much better, man.
Much better.

45:30.294 --> 45:33.457
He's my pretty little principal.

45:33.697 --> 45:35.164
Hey, look!

45:35.799 --> 45:40.395
Carla! Carla!
Carla! Carla!

45:49.046 --> 45:51.344
Twenty-two bottles
of beer on the wall

45:51.415 --> 45:53.679
Twenty-two bottles of beer

45:53.751 --> 45:55.309
You take one down...

45:58.322 --> 46:01.382
This is the greatest!
Right, Herbert?

46:03.026 --> 46:04.118
Dags?

46:05.696 --> 46:08.665
I've been thinking about
our impending relationship,

46:08.732 --> 46:10.199
which I think is a good idea.

46:10.267 --> 46:13.134
And as long as you don't
talk too much,

46:13.203 --> 46:15.137
you let me call the shots,

46:15.205 --> 46:19.835
and my parents never,
never, never find out about you,

46:19.910 --> 46:22.743
I think it could
work out between us.

46:25.482 --> 46:27.814
Are you paying attention to me?

46:28.952 --> 46:31.079
- Twenty bottles of beer on the wall
- Stop it, Virus.

46:31.155 --> 46:32.554
Twenty bottles of beer

46:32.623 --> 46:35.854
Dags <i>...</i> this is serious.

46:35.926 --> 46:39.453
Take one down, pass it around,
twenty bottles...

46:44.301 --> 46:48.067
Spock! Shuttlecraft has encountered
strange alien matter.

46:48.138 --> 46:50.231
Have Chekov
scan computer bank.

46:51.441 --> 46:53.500
Wong...

46:53.577 --> 46:55.306
...proceed.

47:00.717 --> 47:02.844
Hey, Reg, man, gimme a beer.

47:03.387 --> 47:05.480
I'm gettin' cotton-mouth.

47:06.657 --> 47:07.783
Reg?

47:08.492 --> 47:09.982
Oh, man.

47:11.428 --> 47:15.455
Boy, you guys, man,
you sure don't know how to party, man.

47:16.233 --> 47:18.827
Boy, when I was your age...

47:18.902 --> 47:21.302
...well, we partied, man.

47:22.039 --> 47:23.870
Well...

47:23.941 --> 47:27.172
...talk about party,
might as well get one goin'.

47:55.973 --> 47:57.873
<i>Hey, you at the back of the bus.</i>

48:00.477 --> 48:02.638
<i>Tell your driver to pull over.</i>

48:14.124 --> 48:15.955
<i>Pull over now!</i>

48:40.550 --> 48:41.812
Shields up.

48:42.819 --> 48:44.377
Red alert.

48:49.626 --> 48:51.787
Oh, shit!

49:15.052 --> 49:16.952
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

49:18.889 --> 49:22.484
Hey, Red, the party's over, man.
Chill out, dude.

49:23.060 --> 49:26.393
Red, you're making us a little nervous.

49:26.463 --> 49:28.158
Do you think you could slow down?

49:28.832 --> 49:30.094
Red?

49:32.202 --> 49:34.670
Red's dead!

49:38.041 --> 49:39.838
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

49:41.979 --> 49:43.310
Great.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.112
Stop the bus!

49:50.187 --> 49:52.280
Too late.

49:52.356 --> 49:54.620
I'm gonna try
and jump the water.

49:54.691 --> 49:57.125
Stop the bus, you idiot!

49:57.194 --> 50:00.163
All right. Hold on, everybody.

50:13.610 --> 50:16.238
Steady as she goes.

50:33.096 --> 50:34.256
Wow.

50:36.566 --> 50:37.897
That's cool.

50:47.811 --> 50:50.837
Red ruled, man!
Don't cry, okay?

50:50.914 --> 50:52.245
Check it out.

50:52.315 --> 50:55.182
This is him in his prime
and stuff.

50:55.252 --> 50:57.516
Bye, guy. We'll see ya, okay?

50:58.355 --> 51:00.585
He's the Dope King, you know?

51:00.657 --> 51:04.991
See? The Dope King, man.
Long live the Dope King!

51:05.062 --> 51:07.895
It was bad. And he had the phaser.
He did.

51:08.532 --> 51:09.965
We're dredging the water now,

51:10.033 --> 51:12.763
but there's no sign
of your Star Trek man.

51:12.836 --> 51:15.771
We're gonna have to submit you
to a breathalyzer test, Mr. Woo.

51:17.274 --> 51:19.572
I told you not to pick him up,
asshole.

51:19.643 --> 51:23.079
Come on, come on.
Gather 'round.

51:29.519 --> 51:32.579
What are you people
trying to do to me?

51:34.157 --> 51:37.285
We're not even in Washington yet,
and we already have a...

51:37.360 --> 51:39.225
...a fatality!
- Principal Moss?

51:39.296 --> 51:40.456
What?!

51:47.003 --> 51:49.437
Is there something
I can help you with, Officer?

51:49.506 --> 51:52.031
I'm gonna need
a number and an address

51:52.109 --> 51:54.873
- where I can get in contact with you.
- Yes.

51:57.614 --> 52:01.414
"Fairmount High School."
Must be quite a place.

52:02.352 --> 52:03.512
What?

52:07.824 --> 52:10.156
All right, everybody,
back on the bus!

52:10.760 --> 52:13.092
- Go on!
- I'm driving!

52:17.367 --> 52:19.426
Lieutenant! Lieuten...

52:20.270 --> 52:23.000
Thank God! Klingon fools.

52:27.944 --> 52:31.880
This is all my fault.
Maybe we should cancel the trip.

52:31.948 --> 52:34.473
No. We're not canceling the trip.

52:34.551 --> 52:36.382
And no more talking!

52:36.453 --> 52:39.115
I'm not gonna have you people
making a fool out of me.

53:13.023 --> 53:16.789
Now... stay here, don't touch,
and don't move.

53:19.796 --> 53:21.263
I'm outta here.

53:28.138 --> 53:31.301
Good afternoon. Welcome to
the Bradgate. How can I help you?

53:31.374 --> 53:34.309
Hello, there <i>...</i> Peggy.

53:34.377 --> 53:35.844
Hello.

53:35.912 --> 53:37.243
Todd Moss.

53:37.314 --> 53:40.215
Principal, Fairmount High.

53:43.720 --> 53:46.621
I believe you have
some reservations for us.

53:48.325 --> 53:51.624
Fairmount High.
Let me check the computer.

53:54.297 --> 53:55.423
Fetch.

53:58.735 --> 54:01.397
We're here to meet the President.

54:02.239 --> 54:03.900
I'll get you some stationery.

54:03.974 --> 54:06.534
- Over here!
- Where? Where?

54:06.610 --> 54:09.010
- Quit pushing me!
- Wrong way!

54:09.079 --> 54:11.843
- Now look what you did!
- That's not my fault.

54:15.385 --> 54:17.410
Sorry, Principal Moss.

54:33.403 --> 54:34.427
Dude!

54:36.172 --> 54:37.571
Torture stuff.

54:38.975 --> 54:40.567
Check this room out.

54:41.244 --> 54:43.735
- Swing!
- I love it.

54:43.813 --> 54:46.407
Hey, do you have a screwdriver?

54:48.418 --> 54:49.976
This place is a dump.

54:50.053 --> 54:53.545
Now, Steve, this is
the only vacancy we could find.

54:53.623 --> 54:55.887
Let's try to make the best
of the situation.

54:55.959 --> 54:58.484
My parents are gonna
know about this.

55:00.263 --> 55:02.197
All right, students.

55:02.265 --> 55:04.825
Bus leaves in five minutes
for the Washington tour.

55:04.901 --> 55:07.631
- Do we have to go?
- Well, of course, silly.

55:07.704 --> 55:10.798
It's the best part of the trip.
See you in five.

55:13.543 --> 55:15.238
That chick needs to get laid.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.906
Yo, check this out.

55:22.652 --> 55:24.847
- That's disgusting.
- Can he see us?

55:24.921 --> 55:26.388
I don't think so.

55:33.063 --> 55:35.964
Over there is the Lincoln Memorial.

55:38.735 --> 55:41.135
Over there, students,
is the White House.

55:42.706 --> 55:45.197
And over there
was the Jefferson Memorial.

55:46.276 --> 55:47.903
This sucks.

55:48.778 --> 55:51.178
Can't we get off the bus
just for one picture?

55:51.247 --> 55:52.236
No!

55:52.949 --> 55:56.214
Please. We came all this way.

55:59.622 --> 56:02.648
Come on, come on,
gather 'round, gather 'round.

56:02.726 --> 56:05.194
- Let's get this over with.
- Well, now, students,

56:05.261 --> 56:08.788
J. Edgar Hoover was director of the FBI

56:08.865 --> 56:12.198
from 1924 until his death in 1972.

56:12.268 --> 56:14.031
He was a great American.

56:14.104 --> 56:17.870
He was a fascist transvestite,
and I hope he rots in hell.

56:19.142 --> 56:21.542
Hey, why can't we see
Kennedy's eternal flame?

56:21.611 --> 56:25.308
- You people don't deserve Kennedy.
- Who's Kennedy?

56:25.382 --> 56:28.442
Come on, hurry up,
we haven't got all day.

56:28.518 --> 56:29.678
Squeeze in.

56:30.553 --> 56:31.884
Come on, come on,

56:31.955 --> 56:34.651
let's look as though
we're having a <i>little</i> bit of fun.

56:35.225 --> 56:37.284
Come on,
turn those frowns upside-down.

56:37.827 --> 56:41.695
- Leave me alone.
- Okay, here we go.

56:41.765 --> 56:44.359
Virus, pull my finger.

56:45.101 --> 56:46.090
Come on.

56:46.169 --> 56:48.865
One, two...

56:48.938 --> 56:51.805
...three.
- Cheese!

56:55.912 --> 56:57.573
Dude.

56:57.647 --> 56:59.615
What stinks?

57:00.483 --> 57:01.745
Tour's over.

57:15.432 --> 57:19.562
What? I don't believe it.
They blew out Hoover's flame?

57:19.636 --> 57:23.163
My God, these kids are bigger
shitheads than I thought.

57:23.239 --> 57:25.833
<i>Senator, the students</i>
<i>from Fairmount High are here.</i>

57:25.909 --> 57:27.809
Send 'em in.
I'll talk to you later.

57:29.012 --> 57:34.006
Welcome to Washington.
How's the trip been so far?

57:34.083 --> 57:36.381
Wonderful. No problems at all.

57:36.453 --> 57:37.818
Good, good.

57:37.887 --> 57:40.219
So, tell me...

57:40.290 --> 57:42.986
have you kids given any thought
to what you might say

57:43.059 --> 57:45.584
to the committee
about education reform?

57:45.662 --> 57:48.597
Yep. We're gonna tell 'em
that the education system sucks.

57:48.665 --> 57:51.498
- Sucks dick.
- That's not what they mean, sir.

57:51.568 --> 57:53.092
- Why not?
- Well...

57:53.169 --> 57:54.500
- I think it's great.
- I do, too.

57:54.571 --> 57:58.234
Now, remember, the President
invited you kids down to Washington

57:58.308 --> 58:00.970
because he wants you to
tell the nation

58:01.044 --> 58:03.069
how you really feel about school.

58:03.146 --> 58:07.344
So if you think the education system
sucks dick, then, by golly, you tell them.

58:07.417 --> 58:10.682
- Can I have your promise on that?
- I promise.

58:10.753 --> 58:12.721
Excellent, excellent.

58:13.790 --> 58:17.317
Excellent. You've done a good job
with these students, Principal Moss.

58:17.393 --> 58:19.293
I'll look forward to
seeing you all tomorrow.

58:19.362 --> 58:21.193
It's a great day for Americans.

58:22.232 --> 58:25.030
- Quickly, quickly, quickly. Come on.
- Let's get out of here.

58:25.101 --> 58:27.626
- Come on.
- Dick.

58:27.704 --> 58:29.262
I think he gets high.

58:52.061 --> 58:54.495
<i>Oh, God! Yes!</i>

58:54.564 --> 58:56.225
<i>Oh, deeper!</i>

58:57.967 --> 58:59.594
<i>Oh, Forrest!</i>

59:03.273 --> 59:04.262
Come in.

59:07.010 --> 59:10.377
I checked all the rooms.
Everyone is present and accounted for.

59:10.446 --> 59:12.471
Very good. Thank you, Miss Milford.

59:12.549 --> 59:15.484
Oh, my gosh... Lassie!

59:15.552 --> 59:18.020
I love Lassie!

59:18.555 --> 59:20.921
Lassie!

59:20.990 --> 59:23.117
Lassie!

59:23.893 --> 59:27.886
Do you mind if I watch?
All I get is pornos on my TV.

59:27.964 --> 59:29.864
Uh <i>...</i>

59:31.000 --> 59:32.092
Okay.

59:54.424 --> 59:55.914
All right.

59:57.393 --> 59:58.724
You're on.

59:58.795 --> 01:00:01.320
Candygram for Miss Milford.

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:04.499
Here we go, bro.

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:08.736
Good job.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.406
Miss Milford,
we've been looking for you.

01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:15.740
We wanted you to know
how cool it's been,

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:18.872
you know, you showing us
around Washington and everything.

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:20.575
Really?

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.584
So we got you some candy.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.584
I don't know what to say.

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:28.283
How did you know I like chocolate?

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:30.053
'Cause it's all you ever eat.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.652
- Well, we gotta go to bed. Bye.
- I'm so tired.

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:41.865
I really think
they're starting to respect me.

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:54.545
It was so nice of the children
to buy me their little gift.

01:00:56.853 --> 01:00:58.548
They're not so bad.

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:02.820
They just... lack a little guidance.

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:20.808
- Go, Milford!
- Nice!

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:23.641
Very nice!

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:27.341
Todd.

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:35.815
Can I ask you a question?

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.160
Are my breasts too small?

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.526
I think they're...

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:51.703
...perfect.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:55.033
Are you sure?

01:01:58.648 --> 01:01:59.876
Positive.

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.417
Miss Milford, I don't think this is...

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:07.489
Miss Milford!

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:16.731
I hope Todd appreciates
what we've done for him.

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:18.232
Let's rock!

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:21.498
Now, wait just a minute. Have any of you
considered the consequences

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.368
if Principal Moss finds out?

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:27.034
Hey, let's go to that cool hotel.
The schedule said they're havin' a party.

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:28.270
Yeah, good idea, Virus.

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:30.369
Back! You leave me no choice.

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:34.712
As student body president, I am
placing you all under citizen's arrest.

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:38.117
You are all confined to your rooms
until I get Principal Moss.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.484
Miosky, take care of this guy.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.726
Lay a hand on me and I'll sue.

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:45.353
Principal Moss!

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:07.705
- Did you see that?
- It's shocking!

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.816
Bartender!

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:14.015
If I don't get laid tonight,
everyone's gonna think I'm a loser.

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:16.183
By the way, have you
seen those Kennedy boys?

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:18.090
I hear they're lots of fun.

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:19.917
Yeah.

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:27.899
Good one, Herbert!

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:33.701
What... what is that girl doing?

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.280
This party sucks, man.

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:42.215
I thought Washington
was supposed to be cool, Reg.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.583
Hey, Reg, When you gonna get off
your ass and make a play on Wanda?

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:57.060
Hi, sugar.

01:03:58.801 --> 01:04:02.032
Frank Hardin, CEO,
Bounty Burger Enterprises.

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:03.662
Would you take your hands off me?

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:07.937
Now, why don't you and me saunter up
to my room for a little party?

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.478
Get away from me,
you geriatric lush.

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:13.447
I'm not gonna let you go
till you take this key.

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:15.484
I could pay you, if you'd like.

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:23.120
- Hey, are you all right?
- I'm fine, thanks.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.053
You want me to kick his ass?

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:30.458
Get the group.
I'm throwing a party.

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:33.293
Cool.

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:53.553
Look, if you're on your knees
with a table cloth over your head,

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:55.147
who's gonna notice?

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.299
Oops! Sorry.

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.705
Did you ever wonder
if Jason has nightmares

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:29.768
and if Freddy can
invade his nightmares?

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:33.548
Yeah.

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.214
I think about that all the time.

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:38.878
You do?

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:41.947
Me, too.

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:47.224
Can, um, I try an experiment?

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.861
Okay.

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:00.841
You're, um... pretty.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.378
Really?

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:09.042
Okay.

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:13.417
<i>Hospital sources</i>
<i>have no explanation</i>

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:16.049
<i>for the sudden disappearance</i>
<i>of the mysterious man</i>

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:18.821

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:21.988

<i>From Washington,</i>
<i>I'm Gus Feely.</i>

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:00.629
Hey, Virus.

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:03.831
Bet you never made moves
like this in your chess club.

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:06.263
Wanna screw?

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:14.642
Excuse me.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:21.015
Yeah, it was great
for me, too.

01:09:42.377 --> 01:09:44.005
No, come on.

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:53.912
Bonzai!

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:03.421
Help! Somebody help me!

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:10.564
I'm Miosky. I'm here to save you.

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:11.867
What happened?

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:15.377
Uh, I don't know.
Um, I'm comin' in, okay?

01:10:15.444 --> 01:10:18.743
- I'm scared.
- Don't be. It'll all be all right.

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.679
What's your name?

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.181
Du Mi.

01:10:33.829 --> 01:10:37.094
So... here we are.

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:39.930
Just the two of us.

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:42.232
First night in Washington.

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:44.033
Yup.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:48.771
Listen, you were right about
all those things you said to me.

01:10:48.844 --> 01:10:50.505
What things?

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.513
You know, about waking up

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.606
and realizing I've wasted
my life studying.

01:10:55.484 --> 01:10:57.418
Studying sucks.

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:00.249
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:02.586
You're not gonna study anymore?

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:05.650
No, I'm not gonna waste my life.

01:11:06.862 --> 01:11:08.159
Oh, cool.

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:12.624
I need to ask you for a favor.

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:14.692
Sure. What?

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:17.204
Well, I've been thinking
about this, and...

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:19.901
I've decided that I don't want
to go to college a virgin.

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:20.964
Oh.

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:24.807
Oh!

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:28.607
Mission accomplished.

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:54.434
One second.

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:57.501
Excuse me, Miss Milford.

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:04.139
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
what have I done?!

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.805
What have <i>you</i> done?
What about me?!

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:08.372
Two days on the job and I'm already
doing it with the boss!

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:09.940
I'm such a whore!

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:12.579
- Moss, are you in there?
- The senator.

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:13.814
Moss!

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.855
We're dead.

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:19.086
Open the door, Moss.

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:20.788
Just a second, sir.

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:23.861
We're gonna be late if...

01:13:26.935 --> 01:13:29.927
We're due at the Capitol
and you're porking the math teacher?

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:33.171
- Keyboarding teacher.
- Whatever.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.107
Don't just stand there.
Get your clothes on.

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:38.442
- Let's get going. I'll wait outside.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:47.947
Students, are you up yet?

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:50.247
Open the door!

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:56.322
Well?

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:58.730
Don't worry, sir. I'll find them.

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:10.408
I gave you one thing to do
and you screwed it up!

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:13.676
Not to worry, sir, not to worry.
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:15.080
It's a pretty big city, jackass!

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:17.812
- They could be anywhere!
- Oh, my God. I think I found them.

01:14:17.886 --> 01:14:19.717
Eat this!

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:34.368
- What's that?
- Goat.

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:39.104
- This is ridiculous.
- Um, I think they're this way, sir.

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:40.973
- This way! This way!
- Wha...?

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:43.375
It's all just a big set-up.

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:46.972
Here they are, sir.

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:49.779
Well, kids, as you can see,
we've all overslept.

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:51.342
So let's get moving. Quickly. Quickly.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.820
No, we're not going anywhere
with Senator Bung-hole.

01:14:53.889 --> 01:14:55.948
Senator Bung-hole?

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:58.185
D'Agastino, shut up
and let's get going.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.588
Not until you've heard the facts,
Principal Moss.

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:04.632
It appears that Senator Lerman
has invited us to Washington

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.998
for the sole purpose of
embarrassing the President

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:09.401
in order to destroy his education bill.

01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:10.995
What?!

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:13.837
Everything we need to prosecute
is in here.

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:16.270
How did you get ahold of this?

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:19.280
That, uh, information's
on a need-to-know basis.

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.872
You're out of your league, boy.

01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:23.383
Senator Lerman,
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:25.852
Oh, shut up, you little slut.

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:28.014
Now, wait a minute, Senator.

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:34.127
These kids may not be
the cream of the crop,

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:37.222
but that doesn't give you the right
to walk all over them.

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:42.301
And as for Miss Milford,
I think you owe her an apology.

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:43.668
Why?

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:46.037
I don't need you.
I don't need any of you.

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:48.201
I'll find another way to pass my bill.

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:53.440
And as for you, you pitiful excuse
for a principal,

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:54.846
you're finished at Fairmount High.

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:57.215
In fact, I'm gonna make sure you never
work in another school system again.

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.776
Got it?

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:26.842
Eighteen years of teaching
down the drain.

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:29.350
What am I gonna do?

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:33.548
Hey, don't worry, dude. We're gonna
put in a good word for ya. Huh, guys?

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:35.852
- Sure.
- You got it.

01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:38.916
Hey, we got a serious problem
on our hands.

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:41.963
- What's the matter?
- The senator's got Miosky.

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:50.161
- Miosky!
- Miosky, don't go!

01:16:50.238 --> 01:16:51.762
What's the hurry?

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.274
- Miosky!
- Miosky! Miosky!

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:57.642
- Don't go with him!
- Come here, man!

01:16:57.713 --> 01:16:59.840
- Stay here!
- Miosky!

01:17:01.316 --> 01:17:04.444
Come on now, son, we can't
keep the President waiting, can we?

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:07.488
Miosky, don't get in the car!

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:12.125
- Don't go!
- Christ!

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:17.159
Well, this was an interesting field trip.

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:19.132
- What are we gonna do?
- Go home.

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:20.896
No! We can't let this happen.

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:23.961
But if we go, we're only gonna
make the President look worse.

01:17:24.039 --> 01:17:25.768
Like Vietnam... no way to win.

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:28.275
- What we need is a miracle.
- Yeah.

01:17:28.343 --> 01:17:31.244
Like the time the school got torched
right before finals.

01:17:32.447 --> 01:17:33.675
- That was us.
- That was us.

01:17:33.749 --> 01:17:35.842
- That was you?
- Yeah.

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.646
Now, if we can stop finals,

01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:40.620
then we certainly can stop some
bung-hole senator. Right, AV Man?

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:43.157
- Yeah, right, Dags.
- Let's get him.

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:45.318
- Let's go!
- Yeah, let's go!

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:03.210
Hey, Todd.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:06.870
Waitin' on you, man.

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:13.477
You mean... you want me
to come with you guys

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:17.719
after all the rotten things
I've done to you?

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:19.488
You're one of us now.

01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:21.495
- Yeah.
- Yeah, come on.

01:18:25.901 --> 01:18:28.369
We don't have time for this.

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:31.031
Sorry.

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:34.840
I'm coming.

01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:37.242
- Yeah!
- All right!

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:58.195
Oh, yes, you look just fine.

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:21.656
- What are you doing?
- You drive too slow.

01:19:21.723 --> 01:19:23.281
But I wanna be the driver!

01:19:23.358 --> 01:19:25.656
You can be the timekeeper.

01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:28.787
- Let's rock 'n' roll.
- Yeah!

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.070
Now, listen here.

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:50.778
You just wait until they call for you.

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:54.116
Make me proud, son.

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:12.096
- Time?
- Two minutes till Miosky!

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:13.607
Turn here. It's a shortcut.

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:23.473
Spock, beam me up.
Spock, I'm ready now!

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:42.631
About a week ago,

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:45.537
I received a letter from
some very bright students,

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:49.566
addressing their concerns
about education reform.

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:53.705
As your president, I have always
taken it upon myself

01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:57.582
to reach out to the youth of America
and hear their voice.

01:20:57.652 --> 01:21:00.212
So, without any further ado,

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:04.657
I present to you the future of America.

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:24.970
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it!

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:27.674
- Hurry up!
- Come on! Move! Move! Move!

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:34.988
This way!

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:48.325
Why don't we move on
to some Q & A?

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:50.828
Uh, tell me, son...

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:52.271
Son?

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.274
Son?

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:59.607
What do you see as the problems
afflicting our schools?

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:11.385
What?

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:16.753
Stop!

01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:19.732
That man is mentally challenged!

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:23.869
- Who are you people?
- Mr. Chairman, this is outrageous!

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.930
We're the students of Fairmount High.

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:28.498
- Sorry we're late.
- What's going on here?

01:22:28.576 --> 01:22:31.170
Mr. Chairman, they're out of order!

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:33.806
Aren't those the kids
from the party last night?

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:35.543
- Yes, they are.
- Mr. Chairman, can we continue?

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.278
We've already heard from
the representative from Fairmount.

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:39.217
Let us speak!

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:42.279
- Let us speak! Let us speak!
- They're out of order, Mr. Chairman!

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:45.588
- Let us speak! Let us speak!
- Point of order! Point of order!

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:48.793
- Order!
- Can we have them removed?

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:50.228
Order!

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:56.098
I'll give you just one minute.

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:06.511
Uh, say something intelligent, okay?

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:12.178
Mr. President, we came here to
inform you that you're the victim of deceit.

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:15.689
Senator Lerman is using Miosky
to embarrass you

01:23:15.757 --> 01:23:17.452
in order to push through
his own education reform bill.

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:19.516
That's an out-and-out lie!

01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:22.893
How dare you!
Mr. President, this is outrageous.

01:23:22.964 --> 01:23:26.798
By God, I was trying to protect you
from these juvenile delinquents.

01:23:26.868 --> 01:23:28.335
You're the delinquent!

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:31.804
I've barred them from these proceeding
because I have reports, Mr. President,

01:23:31.873 --> 01:23:34.171
reports that they looted a Quickie Mart,

01:23:34.242 --> 01:23:36.540
- blew out Hoover's flame,
- No way, man.

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:39.011
and were responsible
for the death of their bus driver!

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:43.414
Look, maybe we are screw-ups...

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:47.854
I mean, we didn't even write the letter.
Lisa did, and she's an honor student.

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:50.584
Now, I haven't had the time
to read it yet,

01:23:50.658 --> 01:23:53.218
but I bet what she wrote about
education reform was really smart.

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:57.424
Yeah. You government people need
to make sure that future generations

01:23:57.499 --> 01:24:01.799
get a good education...
so they don't wind up like us.

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:04.703
We're soiled, but it's not too late
to save others.

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:06.365
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:08.306
And, uh, one final thing.

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:11.470
We didn't kill Red.
He partied to death!

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:13.173
Yeah! Yeah!

01:24:21.956 --> 01:24:27.121
Uh... come on, guys.
They're not buying it. Let's go.

01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:03.120
Dag rules!

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:09.229
Lerman, I want to see you
in my office this afternoon.

01:25:09.304 --> 01:25:12.273
- Mr. President...
- Get out of my sight!

01:25:20.348 --> 01:25:21.337
Hey.

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:24.613
Never underestimate Fairmount High.

01:25:24.686 --> 01:25:25.914
Got it?

01:25:25.987 --> 01:25:27.249
Whoo, Todd!

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:29.813
- See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya!
- Loser!

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:32.052
He is nothin' but a loser!

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:34.894
Wasn't this trip just great?

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:37.329
Get real... it was a nightmare!

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:41.159
Come on. Let's get back on the bus
before something goes wrong.

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:45.071
Hands are weary

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:49.241
Eyes stay closed

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:52.907
Women like these

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:54.744
Who break in

01:25:58.286 --> 01:26:00.413
I wanna see you

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:04.625
Tomorrow the green grass

01:26:06.094 --> 01:26:07.755
Oh, my love

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:11.731
Who stands by you when I call?

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:17.427
Once had a good home

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:21.471
Won't fall back on

01:26:23.077 --> 01:26:26.843
Don't you think kindness
has an end?

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:32.743
I wanna see you

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:36.983
Tomorrow the green grass

01:26:38.293 --> 01:26:40.056
Oh, my love

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:43.859
Who stands by you when I call?

01:26:47.569 --> 01:26:51.232
Tomorrow the green grass,
tomorrow the green grass

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:54.798
Tomorrow the green grass,
yeah, yeah, yeah

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:58.642
Tomorrow the green grass,
tomorrow the green grass

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:01.807
Tomorrow the green grass,
the green grass

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:19.195
Starry maple

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:23.269
Signs stay closed

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:28.870
Back in my pocket's all you hear

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.375
I wanna see you

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:38.410
Tomorrow the green grass

01:27:39.821 --> 01:27:41.686
Oh, my love

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:45.658
Who stands by you when I call?

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:52.794
Tomorrow the green grass,
tomorrow the green grass

01:27:52.867 --> 01:27:56.325
Tomorrow the green grass,
yeah, yeah, yeah

01:27:56.404 --> 01:28:00.067
Tomorrow the green grass,
tomorrow the green grass

01:28:00.141 --> 01:28:02.939
Tomorrow the green grass,

01:28:22.096 --> 01:28:25.657
Tomorrow the green grass,

Tomorrow the green grass,

01:28:29.437 --> 01:28:32.929
Tomorrow the green grass,
yeah, yeah, yeah

01:28:33.007 --> 01:28:34.736
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:36.504
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:28:36.577 --> 01:28:39.978
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:41.845
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:43.645
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:46.778
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:59.833
Sunshine

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:01.664
Are you outside?

01:29:01.736 --> 01:29:03.795
I am a simpleton by choice

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:06.169
Not speaking to hear my voice

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.868
Sunshine

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.877
Why are you sleeping?

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:15.211
Gotta get outside

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:17.513
Cover the ground on foot

01:29:17.585 --> 01:29:19.849
Not hitching around your spur

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:22.321
Over the river
and through the woods

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:24.585
I've come this far
to bring in the goods

01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:27.059
I get high even when I don't try

01:29:27.128 --> 01:29:29.358
Let 'em pass by
with a wink to the eye

01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:31.455
I reserve the right to be stoned

01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:33.830
I reserve the right
to take it to collect them sums

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:35.232
I have the right

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:38.602
Don't try to be, there's really
no point in you biting me

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:42.200
I'm glad to see that it's easy
for me to be an MC

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:43.641
Let me tell you a little story

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:45.941
Like my dog Bobby hated the pool man

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:48.174
So I tried to play Kotter
and make things cool

01:29:48.249 --> 01:29:50.479
And I said, Just let him smell you,
hold out your hand

01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:53.520
He reached on out
and them - Bam! - he bit him

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:55.385
He bit him so fuckin' hard

01:29:55.456 --> 01:29:57.549
Blood was steady gushin'
all over my back yard

01:29:57.625 --> 01:29:59.889
I kept apologizin',
I felt so fuckin' bad

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:02.225
The dude was so cool,
he didn't even get mad

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:04.628
He said, Man, don't sweat it,
that's the dog's meaning

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:06.997
Took some Neosporin
and went back to his cleaning

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:09.229
Thought I had a dream
or else it was a movie

01:30:09.303 --> 01:30:11.567
Your mind can have a joint,
easy like jungle boogie

01:30:11.639 --> 01:30:13.834
$600 freebie and I got my job

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:16.172
Would you mind come,
but I gots the dog

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:18.644
Come, you can foam the water
with the bone

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:21.011
I wanna tell my mom,
ring her on the phone

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:23.414
Cherry Popsicle, icy cold freezing

01:30:23.484 --> 01:30:25.714
Loves it on his gums
now that he is teething

01:30:25.787 --> 01:30:27.982
Got a wee-wee pass,
lay then by the door

01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:30.353
Nasty little shits,
he dropped them on the floor

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:33.087
Sunshine

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.992
Are you outside?
