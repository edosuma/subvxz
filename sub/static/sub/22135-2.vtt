Family is the ultimate power
on The Gifted.

00:03.237 --> 00:05.573
A lot of people
have been fighting this fight
for a long time,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.141
and now it's our turn.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.711
And check out our other
Fox programs-- The Orville,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.546
Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.715
Gotham needs more people
who are willing
to fight for her.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.588
TED: You have some concerns
about your son Andy?

00:20.621 --> 00:22.022
We believe he's being bullied.

00:22.056 --> 00:24.092
Help! Help me!
(shouting)

00:26.727 --> 00:28.429
Lauren! Come on!
I need to find my brother!

00:28.462 --> 00:30.264
Andy!

00:30.298 --> 00:32.066
I couldn't stop it.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.934
Mom, Andy's a mutant.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.069
I know, because...

00:35.103 --> 00:36.337
CAITLIN:
You, too?

00:36.370 --> 00:37.971
THUNDERBIRD:
Cops!

POLARIS:
Marcos!

00:42.276 --> 00:43.711
Freeze!
(Taser crackling)

00:43.744 --> 00:44.878
Lorna!

00:44.912 --> 00:46.080

behind your back!

Marcos!
Lorna!

00:47.948 --> 00:49.250
BLINK:
This group-- you guys run it?

00:49.283 --> 00:51.419
The network was founded
after the anti-mutant laws.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.053
We help all mutants here.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.723
BLINK: I know you lost
your girlfriend helping me.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.758
Who's this?

00:57.791 --> 00:59.227
My name is Reed Strucker.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.195
My family needs help
getting across the border.

01:01.229 --> 01:02.230
Your associate,

01:02.263 --> 01:03.864
Lorna Dane-- goes by Polaris.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.765
She's pregnant.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.001
She's in a
detainment center.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.871
Any information

01:10.904 --> 01:14.074
is yours,
only if my family is safe.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.943
This is the Sentinel Services.
(siren wailing)

01:16.810 --> 01:18.479
Go, now! Go! Go! Go!

01:18.512 --> 01:20.114
WEEKS:
Deploy the weapon, sir?

01:20.148 --> 01:22.216
THUNDERBIRD: Clarice,
you got to get us out of here.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.152
(shouting)

01:24.185 --> 01:25.586
Andy.
Come on!

01:25.619 --> 01:26.754
(gunshot)
(grunts)

01:26.787 --> 01:28.156
Dad!
No!

01:28.189 --> 01:29.323
Dad!
No!

01:29.357 --> 01:30.491
No.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.198
("Shake It Up" by The Cars
playing)

01:38.999 --> 01:40.468
ALL:
Oh!

01:40.501 --> 01:43.003
You may want to reconsider your
professional bowling career.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.905
I told you, the ball is broken.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.006
(chuckles)

01:46.039 --> 01:47.508
You sure you don't want to play?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.976
Hell no,
I'm not going out there.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.011
REED:
Come on, Mom.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.480
Didn't you and Dad
used to hit the lanes?

01:52.513 --> 01:55.949
Oh, please. Love of bowling
was one of the many things

01:55.983 --> 01:59.187
your father and I
did not have in common.

02:01.021 --> 02:03.157
Observe the master.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.360
Boo.
(laughs)

02:06.394 --> 02:08.396
Boo.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.169
(laughs): Hey!
(whooping)
Yes!

02:15.203 --> 02:16.204
All right!
Ow!

02:16.237 --> 02:17.371
I am off the hook.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.506
Girls are up.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.540
ANDY:
Yes.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.376
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.977
Go, girl!

02:27.348 --> 02:28.749
(beatboxing)

02:29.883 --> 02:31.352
Seriously?

02:31.385 --> 02:33.554
* I'm just giving you
theme music. *

02:33.587 --> 02:35.489
(continues beatboxing)

02:43.063 --> 02:44.398
Nice! Nice.
Yay!

02:44.432 --> 02:46.400
Not as good as me.

02:48.569 --> 02:49.537
ELLEN:
It went down!

02:49.570 --> 02:51.372
Whoa!

02:51.405 --> 02:52.406
All right!

02:54.074 --> 02:55.343
(groans)

02:55.376 --> 02:56.844
MAN:
What's that mutie's deal?

02:56.877 --> 02:58.412
Why don't you just
leave us alone?

02:58.446 --> 03:00.047
MAN:
Why is she shaking?

03:00.080 --> 03:02.383
Her face looks like
a washing machine.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.485
It's fine, okay?
It's okay.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.686
(laughing)
DAUGHTER:
Dad, don't, please.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.190
WOMAN:
That is so weird.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.825
Dad.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.094
Do you see this?

03:14.127 --> 03:15.596
Lauren, it's none
of our business.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.864
Reed.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.532
Come on, Andy.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.402
FATHER:
Hey!

03:21.435 --> 03:23.571
That's enough!
Leave her alone!

03:23.604 --> 03:25.105
Dad, don't, please.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.140
FATHER:
She is a little girl.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.345
What is wrong with you?!

03:31.379 --> 03:32.446
Dad, stop!

03:37.251 --> 03:38.218
(people murmuring)

03:43.491 --> 03:45.326
Shh.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.465
REED:
Sir.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.266
Did you see
what they were doing?

03:52.300 --> 03:54.302
I saw.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.803
And they were wrong.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.306
But you have to listen
to me right now.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.109
I'm a federal prosecutor.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.312
And what your daughter
just did,

04:04.345 --> 04:06.046
damaging property
with a mutant ability,

04:06.079 --> 04:08.148
e-even accidentally,

04:08.181 --> 04:09.650
that's a serious crime.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.920
FATHER: Wha...?
REED: Ju-Just walk away,

04:12.953 --> 04:16.156
before the situation
gets any worse.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.092
Do it for her.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.466
Fine.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.934
Come on, sweetie.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.309
Everything's all right.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.077
Is it?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.512
Why do they have to leave?

04:46.887 --> 04:48.856
REED:
Come on, guys, let's bowl.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.524
Who's up?

04:51.959 --> 04:53.827
*

04:58.899 --> 05:00.601
LAUREN:
Dad!

05:00.634 --> 05:02.603
ANDY:
No, no, no!

05:02.636 --> 05:04.538
THUNDERBIRD (echoing):
Is everyone all right?

05:04.572 --> 05:05.873
ANDY:
Where are we?

05:05.906 --> 05:07.808
W-What was that?
What just happened?

05:07.841 --> 05:09.109
CAITLIN:
Andy, calm down.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.544
You okay? You all right?

05:10.578 --> 05:12.012
Where's my dad?

05:12.045 --> 05:13.781
ANDY: What the
hell was that?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.549
Hey! Where's my dad?
We know as much as you do.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.550
You have to explain this.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.018
What just happened?
Where are we?

05:18.051 --> 05:19.520
This is our headquarters.
ANDY: Where is my dad?

05:19.553 --> 05:20.488
We need to go back.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.555
Please.
Just hang on. Hang on!

05:21.589 --> 05:22.956
Hang on? My husband is
in that warehouse.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.191
We can't just leave him there.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.326
ANDY: W-We have
to go back for him.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.395
He was shot. We need to go back.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.529
Please!
THUNDERBIRD:
Even if we could

05:28.562 --> 05:29.730
get back, it is a very bad idea.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.366
I know you want to help
your dad, but that is suicide.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.734
It's not gonna help him
if we all get killed.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.404
Right now, we need
to take care of Clarice.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.138
(gasping)

05:38.171 --> 05:39.640
Where are you taking her?
Please.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.842
You got to help us.
Can you get us back to my dad?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.577
It hurts.
I've never gone that far before.

05:43.611 --> 05:44.712
Ugh, she's in no...

05:44.745 --> 05:45.846
Okay, here.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.715
(grunting)

05:47.748 --> 05:49.216
No, no, no, no.

05:49.249 --> 05:50.551
Give her some space.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.552
ANDY: You've got
to wake her up.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.253
Hey!

05:53.286 --> 05:56.056
Can you wake her up, please?
Look, kid!

05:56.089 --> 05:57.925
Look, your dad
was gonna help me

05:57.958 --> 05:59.493
get my girlfriend out of jail.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.661
I want him here

06:00.694 --> 06:03.731
just as much as you do, but
we cannot do this right now.

06:03.764 --> 06:04.632
All right?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.407
(sirens wailing,
helicopter blades whirring)

06:15.609 --> 06:17.611
JACE:
All right, everybody, listen up.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.747
In addition to the Struckers,

06:19.780 --> 06:21.849
we're seeking
three mutant suspects.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.619
Two unidentified males,
one female prison escapee.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.455
All are to be considered
extremely dangerous.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.857
We believe these suspects are
working with a national network

06:29.890 --> 06:31.959
helping fugitive mutants escape.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.794
It's our job
to make sure that they don't.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.629
So we're gonna search
every square inch

06:35.663 --> 06:37.631
of this area, all of it--
behind doors,

06:37.665 --> 06:39.600
walls, underwater.
Just because something

06:39.633 --> 06:41.535
doesn't seem possible
doesn't mean it didn't happen.

06:41.569 --> 06:42.803
You know what you're
up against; go do it.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.987
Mr. Strucker.

07:00.020 --> 07:03.056
I'm Agent Turner
with the Sentinel Services.

07:03.090 --> 07:07.795
I can't feel my arms or my legs.

07:07.828 --> 07:11.231
Yeah, you were hit
with an immobilization round.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.233
Life's gonna suck for
the next few hours.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.502
So rest up,

07:14.535 --> 07:16.103
'cause when that round
wears off,

07:16.136 --> 07:18.271
you and I are gonna
have a little chat

07:18.305 --> 07:20.240
about your family.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.843
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

07:38.559 --> 07:40.628
(door buzzes)

07:46.534 --> 07:48.401
(prisoners whooping
and chattering)

07:51.705 --> 07:53.674
(lock clicks)

07:53.707 --> 07:54.642
WOMAN:
Ha, we got a new mutie.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.677
Look at her.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.579
Check her out.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.593
(electricity crackling)

08:15.996 --> 08:17.598
(collar beeping)

08:19.900 --> 08:21.769
(laughter)

08:25.205 --> 08:27.575
(distorted laughter)

08:35.549 --> 08:36.750
(panting)

08:36.784 --> 08:39.820
AMBER:
Hey. Fish.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.421
You all right?

08:41.454 --> 08:44.157
What-what, uh...
what is this thing?

08:44.191 --> 08:45.425
Flea collar.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.894
They build them special
for each mutie,

08:46.927 --> 08:49.229
so you can't do
nothing dangerous.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.699
They didn't tell you?

08:51.732 --> 08:53.934
No.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.203
Fair warning, girl.
They ain't the only ones

08:56.236 --> 08:57.938
gonna be gunning for you
in here.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.574
Yeah, well, I'm not planning
on being here long.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.009
(laughs)

09:02.042 --> 09:03.777
Well, good luck with that.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.746
Only way I ever
seen a mutie

09:05.779 --> 09:07.748
leave here is in a box.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.549
You with a crew?

09:09.583 --> 09:11.018
Anyone you roll with?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.754
No, I'm on my own.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.422
That so?

09:15.455 --> 09:17.758
Well, you ain't gonna last
if you don't got backup.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.293
I got backup.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.265
Just not in here.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.403
THUNDERBIRD:
I know, I know, Sonia.

09:30.437 --> 09:31.639
But Clarice is
in bad shape.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.741
We need to do
something for her.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.809
DREAMER: I've been trying to
reach a doctor in Gainesville.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.745
I can't get anybody
at this hour.
Just keep trying.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.781
And we need to try to find
a place for the family.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.617
(chuckles) This family--
who are these people?

09:43.651 --> 09:44.918
You almost got
killed, Johnny.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.288
We didn't discuss this.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.790
No, we didn't.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.959
It's about time we talked about
this freelance job of yours.

09:51.992 --> 09:55.428
You just run off and pull
this without telling anyone?

09:55.462 --> 09:58.465
We help mutants in danger, John.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.901
Those kids are mutants, and you
sure as hell saw the danger.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.269
Come on, don't
give me that.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.671
This was about Lorna.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.805
So what if it was?

10:04.838 --> 10:06.807
We can't just leave her
out there.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.108
You don't think
I want her back, too?

10:08.141 --> 10:09.609
We're not gonna help her
by destroying

10:09.643 --> 10:10.678
the whole organization.
LAUREN: Guys.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.313
You got to come.
Something's wrong.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.787
CAITLIN:
She's in respiratory distress,

10:19.820 --> 10:21.488
and her temperature's spiking.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.356
I'm a nurse.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.826
She needs help.

10:25.859 --> 10:29.863
She portalled for miles.
The energy that must take.

10:29.897 --> 10:32.132
I can't, I can't breathe.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.633
She needs medical attention.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.268
We can't get a doctor right now.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.837
Are you telling me
you have this whole network,

10:36.870 --> 10:39.106
and you don't have a...
A what? A Blue Cross?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.507
Yeah, we're on the mutant plan.

10:40.540 --> 10:41.942
No, we've got
some first aid

10:41.975 --> 10:43.276
and some painkillers.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.878
Can you do anything?
I-I took...

10:44.912 --> 10:47.881
a one-week course on human
variant medicine in school.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.149
LAUREN:
Mom.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.684
She saved us.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.485
You can help her.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.822
(panting):
Yeah. Okay.

11:00.994 --> 11:01.962
Her heart rate's
through the roof.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.563
Without running tests,
I can't...

11:03.596 --> 11:05.032
(gasps)

11:05.065 --> 11:06.734
(electricity crackling)

11:06.767 --> 11:07.701
What, what's she doing?

11:08.902 --> 11:10.070
What's going on?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.074
She may be in shock.

11:14.107 --> 11:17.177
If her system's crashing,
if it's unstable,

11:17.210 --> 11:18.678
it may be affecting
her abilities.

11:18.712 --> 11:19.913
What does she need?

11:19.947 --> 11:23.050
Hypercortisone-D to
stabilize her powers.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.352
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate
for potassium.

11:25.385 --> 11:28.255
S-Something to restore
her blood calcium.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.857
She needs a hospital.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.759
Whoa, a hospital? She's wanted.
She'll go straight back to jail.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.896
I don't think you understand me.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.397
She could die here.

11:38.866 --> 11:39.933
(electricity crackling)

11:42.736 --> 11:44.437
What is that?

11:52.913 --> 11:54.414
Move!

11:54.447 --> 11:56.549
(horn honks, tires screeching)

11:57.150 --> 11:57.818
(screams)

11:59.552 --> 12:01.421
(grunts)

12:07.594 --> 12:08.829
(gasps)

12:10.964 --> 12:12.933
(panting)

12:15.335 --> 12:18.571
All right. You all
right? Come on, go.

12:18.605 --> 12:19.439
Come on.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.608
Go.
Mom. Mom.

12:21.641 --> 12:22.876
Oh, God.

12:22.910 --> 12:23.977
No, it's okay.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.212
You're cut.
It's okay.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.079
Is anyone hurt?

12:28.648 --> 12:30.250
All right, all right,
we got to move her.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.451
Clear the table, now.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.024
(grunts)

12:41.294 --> 12:43.430
I thought you said she was
overextending her powers.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.965
How is she doing this?

12:44.998 --> 12:47.467
I think I was pretty clear;
I'm not an expert.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.836
(grunting)

12:48.869 --> 12:50.470
(electricity crackling)

12:55.208 --> 12:56.977
Look! It's
happening again!

13:01.014 --> 13:04.251
LAUREN:
That's the same road as before.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.988
This is a problem.
They can see us.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.790
MAN:
What the hell is that?

13:10.824 --> 13:12.860
We're not getting into a pitched
battle with innocent bystanders.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.361
Yeah?

13:14.394 --> 13:15.662
What about him?

13:20.901 --> 13:22.870
ANDY:
Lauren, what are you doing?!

13:22.903 --> 13:24.872
(whooshing)

13:30.077 --> 13:31.311
CAITLIN:
Lauren, watch out!

13:36.049 --> 13:38.185
(exhales)

13:38.218 --> 13:40.653
Dude, what did
you just do?

13:40.687 --> 13:42.990
I don't know. I just...

13:43.023 --> 13:44.524
I used shields
to close it.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.660
I didn't think it'd work,
but... I guess it did.

13:49.096 --> 13:49.897
Yeah, it worked.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.698
For now.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.901
Clarice is in bad shape;
that could happen again.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.335
Yeah, again?

13:55.368 --> 13:57.905
If people start coming through,
we're toast.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.874
Hey.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.243
If we get you that medicine,
can you help her from here?

14:03.276 --> 14:07.047
(laughs) You can't just buy
hypercortisone-D

14:07.080 --> 14:08.882
at Walgreens.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.051
You have to get to the hospital,
get in the Pyxis machine.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.419
ECLIPSE:
Well, then we'll take you.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.888
If this happens
again, can you do...

14:14.922 --> 14:16.789
whatever it is
you just did?

14:19.726 --> 14:22.062
Yeah. I think so.

14:22.095 --> 14:22.896
Good.

14:22.930 --> 14:23.931
CAITLIN:
No.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.033
I am not leaving my daughter
here to close...

14:26.066 --> 14:27.167
space holes.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.369
Mom. It's okay.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.772
I can do this.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.046
JACE:
Look, I know you're still

14:39.079 --> 14:40.180
recovering from
your arrest.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.449
I just want to make sure
you understand your rights.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.918
I've been a prosecutor
for 20 years; I know my rights.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.086
And my children's rights.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.188
It's not illegal
to be a mutant.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.589
I never said it was.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.124
I'm just focused on crimes
committed by them.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.893
You know, you've put your family
in a pretty bad situation.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.099
Now, I would argue that
the decisions you make today

14:59.132 --> 15:01.101
are the most important
of your life.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.103
If you cooperate...
Cooperate?

15:03.136 --> 15:04.237
With you?

15:05.838 --> 15:07.907
You sent sentinels
after my children.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.143
I seem to remember

15:10.177 --> 15:12.079
giving you the opportunity
to surrender peacefully.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.547
This would be the time
that you get me my lawyer.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.316
Yeah. No, yeah, we can do that.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.118
You ask for a lawyer,

15:18.151 --> 15:20.053
we're obligated
to provide one for you.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.389
Now, as you know,
once that happens,

15:22.422 --> 15:25.125
the charges against...
What do you think
you have on me?

15:25.158 --> 15:27.294
Obstruction of justice?

15:27.327 --> 15:29.162
Accessory after the fact?

15:31.164 --> 15:34.167
Mr. Strucker, come on, man.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.136
I think you know
we're willing to push it

15:36.169 --> 15:37.737
a lot further than that.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.807
There's not gonna be
any deals made here today.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.109
I'm doing you a favor
even discussing this...

15:42.142 --> 15:43.943
No, what you are doing

15:43.977 --> 15:47.014
is denying my rights
by holding me without counsel.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.982
Unless you want your
case thrown out

15:49.016 --> 15:50.750
before it even
reaches a courtroom,

15:50.783 --> 15:52.519
you may want to fix that.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.154
You know, technically,
you're only being detained

15:54.187 --> 15:56.356
at the moment;
you haven't been charged yet.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.859
So, yeah...

15:59.892 --> 16:02.795
let's get you some charges.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.697
Then we can talk about lawyers.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.336
CAITLIN: How long is
this drive going to take?

16:09.369 --> 16:12.205
My children
are back there alone.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.640
ECLIPSE:
They're not alone.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.975
John's a tracker, but he's
also damn near bulletproof.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.178
He's strong as a...

16:18.211 --> 16:19.446
I don't know.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.081
He's very strong.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.220
You and my husband had a deal
to help our family.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.189
Yeah. We did.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.990
I expect you
to honor that deal.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.059
We need to get Reed back,

16:32.092 --> 16:34.194
and we need to get
out of the country.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.695
You know your
husband was trying

16:35.728 --> 16:37.164
to send my girlfriend
to prison, right?

16:37.197 --> 16:39.366
He was following the law.

16:39.399 --> 16:43.236
Has he prosecuted mutants?
Yes, but...

16:43.270 --> 16:45.205
But some of his best
friends are mutants?

16:45.238 --> 16:47.207
Try his children.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.842
That's exactly my point.

16:49.876 --> 16:53.513
Tell me this-- if it wasn't
your kids in that gym,

16:53.546 --> 16:55.582
would you be
standing up for them?

16:55.615 --> 16:56.716
Would your husband?

17:02.422 --> 17:03.723
(door buzzes)

17:03.756 --> 17:05.325
GUARD: All right, let's go.
Keep it moving.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.228
(woman whoops, speaks Spanish)

17:08.261 --> 17:10.930
WOMAN:
Ven aquí, perra.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.534
(laughs)

17:14.567 --> 17:17.104
Keep moving.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.471
That's what
the shower's for.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.382
I said, move.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.554
*

17:49.936 --> 17:51.604
(women murmuring)

18:13.760 --> 18:15.895
So, who is she,
anyways?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.764
(groans softly)

18:17.797 --> 18:21.168
She's a refugee,
escaped from jail.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.236
Jail?

18:23.270 --> 18:25.972
We found her.
What did she do?

18:26.005 --> 18:29.176
THUNDERBIRD:
She used a portal to steal food
from the back of a supermarket.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.144
Happens a lot
with mutants

18:31.178 --> 18:34.247
who can't pass for human;
they can't get jobs,

18:34.281 --> 18:35.182
one thing leads to another...

18:35.215 --> 18:37.817
(grunts, gasps)

18:37.850 --> 18:40.019
(electricity crackling,
Blink panting)

18:40.052 --> 18:42.922
Hey. It's happening.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.191
Get everyone safe.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.526
Everyone, move! Let's go!

18:46.559 --> 18:48.195
(siren wailing)

18:49.362 --> 18:51.298
Lauren? You got this?

18:53.833 --> 18:57.337
(grunting)

18:57.370 --> 18:58.671
OFFICER: We need more
officers out here, now.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.278
Lauren, hurry!

19:05.312 --> 19:06.045
(grunting)

19:12.685 --> 19:14.221
(distorted police radio chatter)

19:14.254 --> 19:16.022
OFFICER 2:
Listen, I need all the help
I can get out here.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.624
OFFICER 3:
Copy that.
They're on their way.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.826
Yeah, I need a SWAT team
out here ASAP.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.229
We could have
an alpha-level threat here.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.164
(gasps)

19:25.198 --> 19:27.400
(panting)

19:27.434 --> 19:29.336
That was way too close.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.238
I'll be back
in a minute.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.172
Anything happens,
you yell.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.417
What you're doing...

19:46.018 --> 19:47.987
...it's insane.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.357
Thanks.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.293
(sighs heavily)

19:57.430 --> 19:58.931
Do you think, um...

20:01.067 --> 20:03.270
Do you think mutants drink soda?

20:03.303 --> 20:04.604
I'm kind of thirsty.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.239
(chuckles softly)

20:07.407 --> 20:10.277
We are mutants.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.711
Remember?

20:11.744 --> 20:13.646
Right. Yeah.

20:15.482 --> 20:18.251
Still sinking in.

20:35.935 --> 20:39.639
Yeah. It's not much like the
hospitals you're used to, is it?

20:39.672 --> 20:41.274
And they're talking about
closing even this place

20:41.308 --> 20:42.275
to mutant patients.

20:42.309 --> 20:44.076
Turns out one of
our best superpowers

20:44.110 --> 20:46.045
is bankrupting hospitals.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.315
We're born with the ultimate
preexisting condition.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.317
I guess so.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.051
This is gonna be tough.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.253
The E.R.'s secured, and
the drugs are inside.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.289
We're not getting into
the treatment area

20:56.323 --> 20:58.291
without an emergency,
not for hours.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.293
You said a cop shot you.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.494
Where?

21:01.528 --> 21:03.162
Wait, what?

21:03.195 --> 21:05.532
Look, Clarice is dying.
Show me your wound.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.905
All right. Just watch out
for the blood.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.474
I've seen blood.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.208
(chuckles)
Not mine.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.347
(groans)
Yeah.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.148
That's cool, right?

21:22.181 --> 21:25.518
(both panting)

21:25.552 --> 21:26.986
My boyfriend's hurt!

21:27.019 --> 21:28.621
You need to sign these.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.124
(groans)
Oh!

21:32.158 --> 21:34.160
He needs a doctor now!

21:39.332 --> 21:40.967
(groans)
All right, one more,
we're all done.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.438
DOCTOR:
Okay.
(groans)

21:45.472 --> 21:48.941
So, uh, how exactly
did this happen?

21:48.975 --> 21:51.511
Uh, it was an accident.

21:51.544 --> 21:54.481
I was, uh, fixing stuff
on the roof,

21:54.514 --> 21:57.350
and you know the little sticker
on the ladder that says,

21:57.384 --> 21:59.786
"Don't step above
this step"?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.488
I stepped above the step.

22:01.521 --> 22:04.457
Well, I guess we learned
a lesson today.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.359
ECLIPSE:
We did.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.528
Yeah. The nurse will give you
some instructions on wound care.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.329
Thanks, Doc.

22:10.363 --> 22:12.331
Ma'am, can I talk
to you a moment?

22:12.365 --> 22:14.934
I... Of course.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.377
So, you come here often?

22:24.411 --> 22:27.580
I wanted to talk to you
about your situation

22:27.614 --> 22:28.648
with your boyfriend.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.216
My situation?

22:30.249 --> 22:32.051
What do you mean?

22:32.084 --> 22:34.654
Oh.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.856
Some people think it's
exciting to date a mutant,

22:36.889 --> 22:39.726
but it's no secret there can be
incidents of violence.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.194
Wait, what does having
the X-Gene have to do with that?

22:42.228 --> 22:43.195
I'm just saying,

22:43.229 --> 22:45.432
I have an obligation
as a physician

22:45.465 --> 22:47.400
if this is
a domestic violence situation.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.402
There are
resources that...

22:49.436 --> 22:51.203
No, it...

22:51.237 --> 22:54.106
It isn't, Doctor.
I assure you.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.043
Good.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.046
Then take care of yourself.

23:09.556 --> 23:10.457
Okay.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.863
I don't know.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.565
They just keep opening.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.600
She's able to close them
for now, but I don't know

23:20.633 --> 23:23.269
how much longer she
can keep that up.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.607
Look, the cops are gearing up.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.308
I heard them call in
the SWAT team.

23:29.341 --> 23:31.110
Next time the
portal opens,

23:31.143 --> 23:32.812
we may have a serious problem.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.481
Johnny, if they
come through...

23:34.514 --> 23:35.582
I know, I know.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.484
We need to be ready
to evacuate if necessary.

23:37.517 --> 23:38.485
No.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.052
We have to get her
away from here.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.888
We can't evacuate everyone.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.090
Moving her is too dangerous.
It just made it worse.

23:46.358 --> 23:48.427
So, what are we gonna do?

23:48.461 --> 23:52.431
We're gonna hope Marcos gets
back in time with the medicine.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.505
REED:
Terrorism?

23:58.538 --> 24:00.006
Is this a joke?

24:00.039 --> 24:01.440
Oh, it's anything but.

24:01.474 --> 24:04.477
This mutant here,
Lorna Dane,

24:04.511 --> 24:06.679
aka Polaris--
from what we've been

24:06.713 --> 24:09.582
able to put together,
you used her police file

24:09.616 --> 24:11.518
to make contact
with the Mutant Underground.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.021
That's ridiculous.
Is it?

24:15.054 --> 24:17.089
Because we... we talked
to the coworker

24:17.123 --> 24:18.691
that gave you the file;
she was...

24:18.725 --> 24:20.560
very helpful.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.664
Now, you should know
that there's been talk

24:24.697 --> 24:27.033
for quite some time about
classifying this organization

24:27.066 --> 24:28.701
as a mutant terrorist group,

24:28.735 --> 24:32.171
like the Brotherhood
or the Mutant Liberation Front.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.541
Our lawyers want to make you
and Miss Dane our test cases.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.709
This is insane.
Those groups are nothing like

24:36.743 --> 24:38.678
the Mutant Underground.
Mr. Strucker,

24:38.711 --> 24:41.681
you were prosecuting this woman
three days ago.

24:41.714 --> 24:44.751
Now, what, she's a brave
freedom fighter?

24:51.558 --> 24:55.394
I lost my daughter
in the July 15th incident.

24:55.427 --> 24:59.632
She was seven years old.
Her name was Grace.

24:59.666 --> 25:02.569
People talk about the X-Men,
they talk about the Brotherhood.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.337
Here's the thing:
I'm never gonna know

25:05.371 --> 25:08.741
if the blast of energy
that killed my kid

25:08.775 --> 25:11.010
came from a good mutant
or a bad mutant.

25:11.043 --> 25:14.747
And guess what.
I don't care.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.722
These charges will never stick.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.323
Oh, I disagree.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.525
But I guess that's what
trials are for, right?

25:31.130 --> 25:33.900
(door opens, closes)

25:33.933 --> 25:35.802
(indistinct chatter)

25:45.645 --> 25:47.079
Can I sit here?

25:54.621 --> 25:57.624
I'm, um...

25:57.657 --> 25:58.925
I'm Polaris.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.893
What do you want?

26:03.796 --> 26:06.633
I'm-I'm hoping we can
help each other.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.872
What do you know
about the collars?

26:12.905 --> 26:15.441
Listen, if I can get
my collar off, I can...

26:15.474 --> 26:17.944
You think you're the first
person to think of that?

26:17.977 --> 26:20.412
It's not gonna happen.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.482
What's your problem?

26:23.515 --> 26:24.817
Things are hard enough in here

26:24.851 --> 26:26.653
without people like you
making it worse.

26:30.456 --> 26:32.792
Now, stay the hell away from me.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.837
WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Wiseman,
we need you in the waiting room.

26:44.871 --> 26:47.506
Dr. Wiseman, we need you
in the waiting room.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.008
NURSE: It's a little
different than that.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.677
It's a medication
specifically for mutants.

26:50.710 --> 26:51.811
I'll be right back.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.252
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Nurse Julia,
you have a call waiting.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.154
Nurse Julia.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.192
Stacy?
Yeah?

27:06.225 --> 27:09.428
Uh, Radiology needs
Mr. Embry down for X-rays.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.496
Seriously?

27:10.529 --> 27:11.964
(chuckles)
I know.

27:15.868 --> 27:18.337
*

27:28.881 --> 27:31.150
He's still in triage.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.523
We got to get out of here.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.291
Did you get what you needed?
I think so.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.160
You think?
We can't do this twice.

27:41.193 --> 27:44.363
Listen to me, the doctor's
talking to the police right now.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.833
Come on. Come on!

27:49.168 --> 27:51.670
You sure he was talking
to the cops about us?

27:51.704 --> 27:54.206
I don't know. I didn't think
we should take any chances.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.909
Stop! Police!
Run.

28:15.762 --> 28:17.764
(screams)

28:17.797 --> 28:18.697
That's enough!
Come on!

28:22.935 --> 28:24.771
(door buzzes)

28:24.804 --> 28:26.739
(indistinct chatter)

28:35.815 --> 28:37.784
Hey, mutie, mutie, mutie.

28:40.787 --> 28:42.521
You have a problem?

28:42.554 --> 28:45.291
We'll see.

28:45.324 --> 28:46.759
Muties in here,
they work for me.

28:46.793 --> 28:49.595
From now on, you're gonna
do what you're told.

28:49.628 --> 28:54.300
Ah, and, uh, what if I decline
this exciting opportunity?

28:54.333 --> 28:56.903
(scoffs)
Oh, believe me,

28:56.936 --> 28:58.938
you don't want
to do that.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.040
You see, out there,

29:01.073 --> 29:02.775
you got powers.

29:02.809 --> 29:06.913
But in here, I got powers.

29:09.015 --> 29:12.118
Well, then I bet you're
pretty glad you met me in here.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.752
Let me guess.

29:13.786 --> 29:17.156
You get those, uh, beauty
marks from one of us?

29:18.958 --> 29:20.559
Right.

29:20.592 --> 29:21.961
Nice talk, ladies.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.030
Let's do it
again sometime.

29:29.635 --> 29:30.636
(coughing)

29:32.671 --> 29:33.873
You're pretty tough.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.809
I heard you're knocked up.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.713
Let's see how tough
that little mutie baby is.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.853
(laughs)

29:46.886 --> 29:48.187
(collar buzzing)

29:49.521 --> 29:51.690
(grunting)

29:57.129 --> 29:59.031
(clamoring)

29:59.065 --> 30:00.399
GUARD:
Move!

30:01.901 --> 30:04.971
(distorted shouting)

30:05.004 --> 30:06.873
(door buzzes)

30:06.906 --> 30:08.007
Cool down.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.509
Got yourself
some hole time.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.312
(groaning):
Can't do this.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.414
No, no, no, no!

30:25.324 --> 30:27.059
(panting)

30:27.093 --> 30:30.062
She's burning up.
This is getting worse.

30:30.096 --> 30:31.998
BLINK:
It hurts.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.866
It hurts. I have to get away.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.902
We need to start getting
everyone out of here.

30:35.935 --> 30:39.038
We are not gonna
abandon this place.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.506
THUNDERBIRD:
I don't see what choice we have.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.141
All right? She's opening portals
every few minutes now,

30:42.174 --> 30:43.509
and Lauren can't
keep this up.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.077
I can keep trying, but...

30:45.111 --> 30:47.713
Mom has to be
back soon, right?

30:47.746 --> 30:49.715
Maybe. We need to consider
the possibility...

30:49.748 --> 30:52.518
(gasping, groaning)

30:53.385 --> 30:54.987
This could be it.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.155
We might have to evacuate.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.089
Clarice!

31:01.093 --> 31:03.930
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

31:13.105 --> 31:14.740
(grunting)

31:14.773 --> 31:16.943
I can't hold it!

31:17.977 --> 31:19.378
(Blink screams, Lauren grunts)

31:21.480 --> 31:22.414
Lauren!

31:23.782 --> 31:25.084
Look out!

31:25.117 --> 31:27.619
On the ground!
On the ground now!

31:29.055 --> 31:31.223
(grunting)

31:35.995 --> 31:38.764
(groans)

31:41.133 --> 31:42.401
(yells)

31:42.434 --> 31:43.970
(officers groaning)

31:52.744 --> 31:55.081
(clamoring in distance)

31:55.114 --> 31:56.915
Hey, hey.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.951
Clarice, wake up.

31:58.985 --> 32:01.020
(electricity rumbling)

32:06.025 --> 32:07.726
What's going on?!

32:07.759 --> 32:08.760
Get out!

32:08.794 --> 32:10.596
MAN:
Move!

32:10.629 --> 32:11.763
Get everyone out now.

32:11.797 --> 32:14.400
MAN: Get out of here now!
Get out! Go!

32:14.433 --> 32:15.434
Lauren, come on.

32:15.467 --> 32:16.969
Come on!

32:27.446 --> 32:29.515
REED: You finally
taking me to my lawyer?

32:29.548 --> 32:33.152
Now, I-I really need you to...
understand the stakes.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.853
I think you're making
the mistake of believing

32:34.886 --> 32:36.255
that you and your wife
and your kids

32:36.288 --> 32:37.756
are the only ones
in jeopardy here.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.559
What's that supposed to mean?

32:48.700 --> 32:50.769
*

32:50.802 --> 32:52.538
(door closes)

32:52.571 --> 32:54.473
WEEKS:
We're interviewing everyone
who's involved...

32:56.208 --> 32:58.077
ELLEN:
You think this was intentional?

33:00.912 --> 33:02.381
You brought my mother?

33:02.414 --> 33:05.151
Oh, we're bringing in
every potential coconspirator.

33:05.184 --> 33:08.020
My family would
never attack anyone.

33:08.054 --> 33:11.023
You really expect me to believe
you had no involvement?

33:11.057 --> 33:12.191
We have phone records.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.559
He's my son!

33:13.592 --> 33:15.194
I saw the news,

33:15.227 --> 33:16.662
I tried to call him.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.098
WEEKS:
What about your husband?

33:21.433 --> 33:23.202
I have no idea.

33:23.235 --> 33:25.304
He lives alone

33:25.337 --> 33:26.705
in Chattanooga.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.374
WEEKS: Are you a political
person, Mrs. Strucker?

33:28.407 --> 33:29.908
Do you consider yourself
an activist?

33:29.941 --> 33:31.377
This is harassment.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.012
She had nothing to
do with any of this.

33:34.046 --> 33:37.316
Just tell me who's involved,
man, she goes home.

33:37.349 --> 33:40.086
You've supported
the mutant rights movement.

33:40.119 --> 33:43.222
You protested
the South African government.

33:43.255 --> 33:46.592
I marched against apartheid
in 1984.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.261
They were oppressing
all kinds of people.

33:49.295 --> 33:51.230
Not just the mutants.

33:51.263 --> 33:52.864
WEEKS:
So you admit you're involved.

33:52.898 --> 33:56.668
You can stop this
at any time, Mr. Strucker.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.337
Tell me how to find
your family.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.871
ELLEN:
...my family is okay.

33:59.905 --> 34:02.074
WEEKS:
That may be up to you, ma'am.

34:02.108 --> 34:04.443
CAITLIN:
What happened at the hospital--

34:04.476 --> 34:07.913
is it always that bad
for mutants?

34:07.946 --> 34:10.449
You thought that was bad?

34:10.482 --> 34:12.351
That doc actually stitched me
up before he called the cops.

34:12.384 --> 34:15.087
That's top flight
mutant health care right there.

34:15.121 --> 34:17.956
I mean, there are protections,
though-- the Civil Rights Act.

34:17.989 --> 34:20.292
Yeah, yeah, mutant rights--
oh, they're a nice idea.

34:20.326 --> 34:23.129
But there's always an exception
for public safety.

34:23.162 --> 34:24.430
All they have to do
is call you dangerous,

34:24.463 --> 34:26.865
and you know what happens
to those so-called rights?

34:26.898 --> 34:27.866
(snaps fingers)

34:27.899 --> 34:29.768
Poof, they're gone.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.939
How did your family
deal with it?

34:33.972 --> 34:36.608
They didn't.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.212
When I first lit up, I was 13.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.980
They kicked me out the same day.

34:42.013 --> 34:44.483
Uh, to survive,

34:44.516 --> 34:47.486
I had to do a lot of things
that I'm not proud of,

34:47.519 --> 34:50.689
but it was Lorna who
saved me from all that.

34:52.124 --> 34:53.992
She's my family.

34:54.025 --> 34:56.195
My parents not so much.

34:58.297 --> 35:01.133
I can't believe they would
reject their own child.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.502
You haven't.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.171
That's something.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.174
Yeah.

35:08.207 --> 35:09.141
Well, it's...

35:09.175 --> 35:11.343
Something...

35:11.377 --> 35:13.312
CAITLIN: Something's wrong.
ECLIPSE: It's okay.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.681
Turn around. Turn around!
It's a security measure.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.316
It's what? How...

35:17.349 --> 35:19.318
Look, one of our mutants
can project fear.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.353
It keeps people
away from the HQ.

35:21.387 --> 35:22.954
It's not usually this strong.
Something's wrong.

35:31.197 --> 35:32.964
¿Que pasa aquí?

35:32.998 --> 35:34.433
Estamos evacuando.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.867
¿Evacuando?

35:38.036 --> 35:40.539
CAITLIN: What's happening?
ECLIPSE: It's not good.

35:40.572 --> 35:41.940
What did he say?

35:41.973 --> 35:43.375
They're evacuating.

35:43.409 --> 35:46.011
What? Where are my kids?

35:46.044 --> 35:48.380
(electricity crackling,
mutants clamoring)

35:51.883 --> 35:53.452
Grab only what you can carry!

35:53.485 --> 35:56.188
You all right, you good?

36:06.332 --> 36:09.000
Okay, let's go.

36:09.034 --> 36:09.901
(child screams)
You're okay.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.871
You're okay.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.273
Mom!

36:15.274 --> 36:16.742
Mom!

36:16.775 --> 36:18.977
Thank God you're okay!

36:19.010 --> 36:20.078
Andy!

36:20.111 --> 36:21.380
Give me the medication.

36:21.413 --> 36:22.681
What?
Clarice is still inside.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.416
I'll go in there.
I'll try to give it to her.
No.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.385
You don't know the dosage.
Too much can make this worse.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.420
Caitlin...

36:28.454 --> 36:30.889
Marcos, keep everyone
safe. Stay here!

36:30.922 --> 36:32.090
Mom! Mom!

36:32.123 --> 36:33.425
Stay here and be careful.
No!

36:33.459 --> 36:34.693
Mom!

36:34.726 --> 36:36.428
No!
Mom! Mom!
Come on.

36:36.462 --> 36:37.463
She's all right.
We got to go.

36:39.064 --> 36:39.931
Come on.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.606
(electricity crackling,
rumbling)

37:10.962 --> 37:12.097
Come on!

37:17.303 --> 37:18.537
Caitlin!

37:18.570 --> 37:20.572
I got the medication.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.478
(weakly):
Have to go...

37:26.512 --> 37:29.481
No, Clarice,
you're staying here with us.

37:29.515 --> 37:32.851
I need you to listen to me,
and I need you to be strong.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.522
I have to stabilize
her potassium levels.

37:44.330 --> 37:46.665
We're running out of time.
Hold this.

37:46.698 --> 37:48.434
Okay, Clarice,

37:48.467 --> 37:49.935
deep breath.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.470
And be strong for me.

37:51.503 --> 37:52.538
Now!

37:58.444 --> 37:59.345
(gasps)

38:03.148 --> 38:06.485
(rumbling fades)

38:06.518 --> 38:08.820
*

38:11.156 --> 38:13.124
(Blink panting)

38:13.158 --> 38:15.494
You're gonna be okay.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.396
(whispers):
You're okay.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.733
You're gonna be okay.

38:33.579 --> 38:35.514
(indistinct chatter)

38:43.855 --> 38:45.891
BLINK:
Hey.

38:45.924 --> 38:48.560
All this damage-- was it me?

38:48.594 --> 38:51.162
Is everyone okay?

38:51.196 --> 38:54.332
You were a little hard
on the trees and some furniture,

38:54.366 --> 38:57.135
but... people survived.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.737
(sighs)

38:58.770 --> 39:01.573
This place needed
a remodeling anyway.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.145
I need to ask you something.

39:07.178 --> 39:10.749
You kept opening a portal
to the same road.

39:10.782 --> 39:13.218
Do you know why?

39:13.251 --> 39:15.554
I don't... I don't know.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.456
I don't remember.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.926
I'm sorry.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.194
(whispers):
What?

39:23.228 --> 39:26.398
You should rest.
We can talk about it later.

39:30.636 --> 39:32.671
I'm sorry.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.606
It's all right.

39:47.252 --> 39:49.621
Hey.

39:49.655 --> 39:52.624
Look at me,
both of you.

39:52.658 --> 39:55.126
I'm proud of you.

40:00.298 --> 40:02.033
Mom?

40:02.067 --> 40:04.603
What's gonna
happen with Dad?

40:04.636 --> 40:07.038
We're gonna find him.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.908
But how can you say that?
You don't know that.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.042
Andy,

40:11.076 --> 40:12.544
trust me.

40:12.578 --> 40:13.945
We will find him.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.719
A lot of people have been

40:20.752 --> 40:22.621
fighting this fight
for a long time.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.525
And now it's our turn.

40:30.696 --> 40:33.599
We will fight
to bring your father home.

40:38.303 --> 40:40.939
We'll fight
to bring everyone home.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.291
(sighs)

41:02.393 --> 41:04.530
Are we ready to talk?

41:06.532 --> 41:08.466
You just gonna
sit there?

41:10.702 --> 41:13.572
Mr. Strucker,
you are in a world of hurt.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.108
Y-You know...

41:17.142 --> 41:20.779
I've been thinking about it, and
I'm not sure that I am the one

41:20.812 --> 41:22.514
who's in a world of hurt.

41:25.083 --> 41:28.854
I've sat on that side
of the table.

41:28.887 --> 41:32.057
And, you see, the thing is...

41:32.090 --> 41:35.060
I think if you really were
gonna throw me in the hole,

41:35.093 --> 41:36.728
you would have done that by now.

41:36.762 --> 41:39.798
You're coming in here
with all these charges.

41:39.831 --> 41:43.569
You're... dragging my mother in
for questioning.

41:45.904 --> 41:48.073
I think you've
overplayed your hand.

41:48.106 --> 41:51.376
I don't know what
you think you know here...

41:51.409 --> 41:53.144
You had a bad day.

41:53.178 --> 41:55.714
You lost millions of dollars
of equipment.

41:55.747 --> 41:58.083
You let six fugitives
slip through your fingers.

41:58.116 --> 42:01.386
I've been in your
shoes enough to know

42:01.419 --> 42:03.589
you're desperate.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.426
So, here's what's gonna happen.

42:08.459 --> 42:10.562
We are gonna make a deal today,

42:10.596 --> 42:12.598
but we are gonna do it
on my terms.

42:12.631 --> 42:16.602
I will cooperate with you,
but I go down for this alone.

42:16.635 --> 42:19.037
My mother goes home,
along with anyone else

42:19.070 --> 42:21.573
that you may be thinking
of dragging in here.

42:21.607 --> 42:25.677
But most importantly, my wife
and children stay out of prison.

42:25.711 --> 42:28.346
Your wife assaulted
a Sentinel Services team.

42:28.379 --> 42:29.615
Your kids are wanted
on several accounts.

42:29.648 --> 42:31.349
There's no way in hell...
If you want me,

42:31.382 --> 42:33.585
they go free. Period.

42:33.619 --> 42:35.587
And all of this is
gonna be worked out

42:35.621 --> 42:38.657
by the lawyer
that you bring here right now.

42:42.794 --> 42:45.764
Fine.

42:45.797 --> 42:48.466
You get your deal.
You get your lawyer.

42:48.499 --> 42:49.668
One condition.

42:51.770 --> 42:54.940
I get the Mutant Underground.

42:54.973 --> 42:56.842
Are we clear about that?

43:12.624 --> 43:14.592
Joshua, I need you to look up

43:14.626 --> 43:17.095
whatever files we might have
on mutant siblings.

43:17.128 --> 43:18.529
Of course,
Dr. Campbell.

43:20.198 --> 43:23.669
There was an incident in Rio,
I believe, in the '60s.

43:24.836 --> 43:26.805
Yes. There you go.

43:26.838 --> 43:30.475
The Strucker children, the ones
who destroyed the gymnasium,

43:30.508 --> 43:32.010
have they been found yet?

43:32.043 --> 43:34.245
Sentinel Services
are still looking.

43:34.279 --> 43:36.782
Get me the name of
the head agent on that case.

43:36.815 --> 43:39.685
He and I should talk.

Now here are a few more shows
