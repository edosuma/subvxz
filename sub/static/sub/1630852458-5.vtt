WEBVTT

00:16.975 --> 00:19.394
-It's nice to see you again.
-Yeah, right.

00:19.894 --> 00:20.729
Bullshit.

00:21.312 --> 00:24.566
Fair enough. I'd probably react
the same way if I were you.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.277
My past behavior was…

00:29.863 --> 00:31.114
…inexcusable.

00:31.781 --> 00:35.243
If I could go back
and undo it all, I would.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.537
All I can say now is

00:38.246 --> 00:39.247
I'm truly sorry.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.833
And I assure you,

00:42.417 --> 00:43.877
I'm not that man anymore.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.797
I don't know what padded room
you crawled out of

00:47.881 --> 00:50.258
or what twisted game you two are playing,

00:50.925 --> 00:54.220
but if you don't get off my property
right now, I swear--

00:54.304 --> 00:57.432
-Your dad is pissed. Who is that guy?
-I have no idea.

00:57.515 --> 01:01.269
-He looks like a Highlander<i>.</i>
-<i>The </i>Highlander. There can be only one.

01:01.853 --> 01:02.687
Okay.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.149
Okay, I tried.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.944
We'll still hold our students

01:10.028 --> 01:13.406
to a moratorium on fighting before
the tournament, for what it's worth.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.744
Provided, of course, you do the same.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.871
Just remember our deal.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.832
If Cobra Kai wins the All Valley,

01:23.833 --> 01:25.418
you two are done teaching.

01:27.045 --> 01:27.879
For good.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.507
That's not gonna happen,
'cause you're not gonna win.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.008
Now get the hell out of here.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.559
Has it really come down to this?

01:43.186 --> 01:47.273
Johnny Lawrence playing second fiddle
to little Danny LaRusso?

01:47.357 --> 01:48.525
No one's second fiddle.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.903
This is my dojo as much as it is his.

01:51.986 --> 01:52.821
Really?

01:53.988 --> 01:56.825
Sign out front says Miyagi-Do.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.828
Unless you want it
crammed up your ass sideways,

01:59.911 --> 02:01.913
you'd better take off
after your bridge partner.

02:08.753 --> 02:09.963
Who the hell was that?

02:10.630 --> 02:12.882
LaRusso can sure hold a grudge, can't he?

02:13.883 --> 02:14.717
So?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.178
What now?

02:18.638 --> 02:21.391
Now, we get to work.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.311
So we can wipe the mat
with that arrogant little prick.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.828
They know you and I
are the biggest threat.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.289
They also know
we can't risk violating probation.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.332
We need to get them
somewhere no one is around.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.251


02:48.334 --> 02:50.378
Listen up. Gather round.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.093
We just had a little powwow
with the senseis at Miyagi-Do.

02:57.677 --> 03:01.472
From here on out, there'll be
no more fighting until the tournament.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.684
Our enemies humiliate us,
and we have to back down and take it?

03:04.767 --> 03:08.271
Of course not. We should always
show our enemies no mercy.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.982
But there's a time to fight.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.444
No need to waste a punch
if it's not gonna score a point.

03:14.944 --> 03:19.032
So if your enemies
do something to mess with you

03:19.699 --> 03:21.284
or laugh in your face,

03:21.910 --> 03:22.744
good!

03:23.494 --> 03:25.830
Take all that anger and store it.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.499
You're gonna need it when the time comes.

03:29.834 --> 03:30.960
Is that understood?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.503
Yes, Sensei!

03:37.133 --> 03:39.135


03:42.305 --> 03:44.307


03:47.227 --> 03:50.104
So that's when Mr. Miyagi
agreed to take me back.

03:50.188 --> 03:53.149
And after I beat Barnes,
I never saw Silver again.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.026
Until today.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.363
So let me get this straight.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.949
The year after our title fight,

04:01.032 --> 04:03.201
they put you
straight through to the finals?

04:03.743 --> 04:04.827
That's bullshit.

04:04.911 --> 04:08.122
That's not the point. I'm telling you,
Silver knows how to fight.

04:08.748 --> 04:09.916
No, I'm serious.

04:09.999 --> 04:13.294
I've seen his methods.
I know how his warped mind works.

04:14.754 --> 04:18.132
The game has changed.
We need to change with it.

04:21.177 --> 04:24.264
Which is why I need to take over
our students' training from now on.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.892
-Don't start this shit again.
-Miyagi-Do defeated Silver last time.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.811
Doesn't mean it's gonna work this time.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.855
If you're so worried
about this son of a bitch,

04:32.939 --> 04:34.399
why don't we go kick his ass?

04:34.482 --> 04:36.734
Because that's exactly what he wants.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.195
Why do you think he showed up at my dojo?
Everything he does--

04:39.279 --> 04:41.114
-Your dojo?
-You know what I mean.

04:41.864 --> 04:43.825
Silver's a psychopath, all right?

04:43.908 --> 04:47.578
You cannot strike first with this guy.
Trust me.

04:49.706 --> 04:53.626
Look, I just want what's best
for Miguel and all of your students.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.798
Oh, so now you know
what's best for Miguel, huh?

04:58.881 --> 05:01.301
-I'm just sayin'.
-You know what your problem is?

05:02.302 --> 05:05.471
You think one win by one point
30 years ago makes you better than me.

05:05.555 --> 05:06.556
Johnny. I mean--

05:06.639 --> 05:09.600
One lucky kick
doesn't make you the better fighter.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.938
I was Cobra Kai's number one student.
If anybody knows how to beat 'em, it's me.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.775
Yeah, and how are you gonna do that?
They strike first, you strike firster?

05:17.859 --> 05:20.278
Well, I'm not gonna play defense all day.

05:20.361 --> 05:23.031
-Worked against Silver and you, remember?
-Barely.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.742
We both know if we'd fought ten times,
I'd have beat you nine.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.243
We have fought ten times.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.329
Gentlemen, I have to ask you
to keep it down.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.080
Shut the fuck up. Beat it.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.169
We never fought to the finish.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.756
What? Is that what you want, Johnny?

05:40.381 --> 05:41.674
To finish the fight?

05:41.758 --> 05:43.593
Think you'd beat me again? Prove it.

05:46.095 --> 05:49.265
You and me, tournament-style.
First to three points wins.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.060
And takes over the kids' training.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.565
-That's what I thought.
-You're on.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.401


06:02.195 --> 06:03.071
Tomorrow.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.365
Sundown on the sparring deck.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.788
-You'd better not back out.
-Oh, I'll be there.

06:12.705 --> 06:13.706
Don't you worry!

06:15.666 --> 06:16.918
This is only three dollars.

06:17.502 --> 06:21.422
Just… Just put his drinks on my tab
and bring me another.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.055
Vietnam vet turned businessman.

06:29.138 --> 06:32.517
Had a few ups and downs,
but still turned out pretty rich.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.601
Not much dirt,

06:33.684 --> 06:37.230
other than some toxic waste scandal
in Borneo back in the '80s.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.857
Sounds like a Renaissance man.
How'd you find out his name?

06:39.941 --> 06:43.444
I took a picture at the dojo,
found an old facial recognition beta test

06:43.528 --> 06:45.988
and tweaked the code
to make it compatible with HEIC.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.782
I love it when you talk nerdy.

06:47.865 --> 06:51.577
You are both the first
and my favorite person to say that.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.998
I-I like the new hue.

06:56.082 --> 07:00.211
Purple's the color of the crown chakra,
you know? It symbolizes enlightenment.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.214
Uh, yeah, that's what I was going for. So…

07:03.297 --> 07:04.757
-Yeah.
-Listen.

07:06.676 --> 07:10.179
Bad news. I just found out
my dad's wedding is gonna be in Sydney.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.931
Sydney, Nova Scotia?

07:12.014 --> 07:13.766
-Australia.
-Oh.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.226
Since it's in May,

07:15.309 --> 07:17.937
it means I won't be here
for prom or the tournament.

07:18.020 --> 07:18.855
Oh.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.983
-But I'll still root for you.
-Yeah.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.652
Consider me an admirer from afar.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.364
Hey, I will take whatever I can get.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.657
-Save me a seat at lunch?
-Yeah.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.453
-Specifically this one.
-Oh!

07:33.536 --> 07:34.454
Later, guys.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.208
All right, no offense,

07:39.876 --> 07:41.878
but I have no idea
how you pulled that off.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.004
Neither do I.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.756
I guess I was just myself,

07:45.840 --> 07:47.216
and somehow that worked.

07:47.717 --> 07:48.926
What about you and Moon?

07:49.010 --> 07:51.679
Did I detect a note
of <i>rapprochement</i> in the air?

07:51.762 --> 07:54.056
We're getting used to being friends again.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.850
She has a girlfriend, so…

07:55.933 --> 07:59.687
You mean Piper? Oh no.
That's over. They broke up weeks ago.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.315
Weeks?

08:03.858 --> 08:06.068
One week, five? How many weeks is "weeks."

08:07.111 --> 08:10.072
Yo. You guys won't believe this.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.158
Sensei got drunk
and went on a Twitter rant.

08:12.658 --> 08:16.370
I believe everything except for the part
where he knows how to tweet.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.290
Looks like he and Sensei LaRusso
are gonna have a rematch.

08:19.373 --> 08:20.625
They're really gonna fight?

08:20.708 --> 08:22.752
Apparently. Should've seen this coming.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.838
Who does he even think he's tweeting to?
You're his only follower?

08:25.922 --> 08:28.424
I don't know. H-He seems serious about it.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.260
So this is real?
Sensei and Sensei are gonna throw down?

08:31.761 --> 08:32.595
Mm-hm.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.222
That's awesome!

08:43.272 --> 08:44.315
-Daniel!
-Huh?

08:45.024 --> 08:46.192
Oh, hey, hon.

08:46.275 --> 08:48.194
-Oh yeah.
-Oh man.

08:49.987 --> 08:52.490
Our daughter just sent me this.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.494
Anything you wanna tell me?

09:01.666 --> 09:04.001
I thought you and Johnny
were finally past all this.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.253
So did I.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.171
Well, apparently not.

09:07.255 --> 09:10.716
The two of you are about to have
a showdown at the Okinawa Corral.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.052
Wait. You're gonna fight that <i>stronz</i>.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.306
I don't know what that means,
but are you sure you wanna do this?

09:17.390 --> 09:21.811
This guy had me in an armbar
like he was Royce Gracie, and I was… me.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.273
I gotta agree with Anoush on this one.
Johnny's a bad man.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.900
He took down two bikers, me,
and I had a bat.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.026
Okay, guys.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.821
Guys, thank you.
All right? Thanks. Appreciate it.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.990
Let's go. Come on. Thanks.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.328
What happened?

09:39.412 --> 09:40.997
Terry Silver happened.

09:41.622 --> 09:45.668
He's this certified wack job from my past
who's just come back to Cobra Kai.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.045
Another one. Seriously, Daniel?

09:48.129 --> 09:52.258
Are any other Cobra Kais from your past
gonna come and destroy our lives?

09:52.341 --> 09:53.175
No.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.637
Well, I can't say that for sure.

09:56.721 --> 09:57.847
Oh my God.

09:57.930 --> 09:58.848
Don't worry, okay?

09:58.931 --> 10:01.559
I know I can prepare these kids
for whatever Silver's up to.

10:01.642 --> 10:04.270
I just need Johnny to step back
and give me the reins.

10:04.353 --> 10:05.354
Oh, let me guess.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.773
You told him as much, he didn't like that,

10:08.274 --> 10:10.776
you didn't like that,
and this is where you landed.

10:10.860 --> 10:11.861
Yeah, more or less.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.863
Okay, I know, I know.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.575
But just so I'm clear, you're not
actually going to fight him, right?

10:17.658 --> 10:18.701
Of course not.

10:19.785 --> 10:23.039
We'll sort this out. We just…
The booze got the better of us both.

10:23.623 --> 10:28.002
I'm sure he woke up as hungover as I did
and realizes how stupid this all is.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.035
Hi-yah!

11:02.328 --> 11:03.954
-I kicked his face.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.792
Johnny Lawrence?
He was the worst of them all.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.135
You call yourself a sensei?
You don't know what a sensei is.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.284
"Hey, Johnny.
We both said some things we regret."

11:42.368 --> 11:44.537
"I, uh… I'm sorry if I offended you."

11:44.620 --> 11:47.248
No, no. Don't apologize.
It shows weakness.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.543
Let's just get this over with.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.341
Hey. Why aren't you in school?

11:57.425 --> 12:01.971
Uh, I only had a study hall left,
so I played the cramps card and came home.

12:02.054 --> 12:02.930
You played the…

12:05.683 --> 12:08.519
So what,
you're skipping class now?

12:08.602 --> 12:11.188
No, I'm not skipping.
I'm just setting my own schedule.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.191
What about you? Why aren't you at work?

12:14.692 --> 12:17.111
I, uh, wasn't feeling well.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.739
I had a bit of a rough night.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.074
Makes sense.

12:22.533 --> 12:26.036
Saw Johnny's tweets. Everybody
at school's talking about the fight.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.497
-Oh, great.
-So what did you do to set him off?

12:28.581 --> 12:31.876
What did I do?
Th-that guy gets set off by anything.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.753
Okay? That's the problem here, Sam.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.130
I've tried to make this work
and Johnny's impossible.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.924
No, he's not.
He's just… Has a different style.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.302
It's not a different style.
It's the wrong style.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.430
Okay. Now's not the time
to be aggressive. Trust me.

12:44.513 --> 12:47.099
Does this have something
to do with the guy at the dojo?

12:47.683 --> 12:48.517
Yeah.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.979
Yes, he lured me into Cobra Kai
when I was young.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.317
It was only through Mr. Miyagi's teachings
that I was able to snap out of it.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.737
So right now,
we have to double-down on Miyagi-Do.

12:59.820 --> 13:03.949
So, what, no more Eagle Fang?
Johnny's never gonna go for that.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.202
Yeah. Yeah. So he says.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.079
That's how this whole thing started.
We were…

13:10.998 --> 13:13.042
But don't worry.
There's not gonna be any fight.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.504
Of course not. Miyagi-Do is all about
avoiding fights whenever possible.

13:17.671 --> 13:21.842
Yes. It is. And since when
do you have a problem with that?

13:21.926 --> 13:23.761
Since a psycho attacked me with nunchucks.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.515
Johnny says if we keep taking shit,
they'll keep coming at us.

13:27.598 --> 13:31.018
That's what Johnny says?
I'm sorry, Sam, uh, whose side are you on?

13:31.101 --> 13:33.896
I'm not on anybody's side.
I just wanna learn both styles

13:33.979 --> 13:36.440
so I have twice the techniques
if I face Tory at the tournament.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.025
You sure you can wait that long?

13:38.108 --> 13:41.028
Your mom told me about the party.
It seems you're doing the instigating.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.947
Come on. Compared to what Tory's done?

13:43.030 --> 13:44.657
-That was nothing.
-I get that.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.743
But we don't believe in aggression.
That's not how we act.

13:47.827 --> 13:52.039
Maybe that's not how <i>you </i>act,
but I can make my own decisions.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.839
<i>Three things make a champion.</i>

13:59.922 --> 14:01.090
The three D's.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.050
Desire.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.135
-Devotion.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.638
-And discipline.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.517
-The first two, I can't give you.

14:11.600 --> 14:15.062
The last one, I can,
but you have to be willing to receive it.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.983
-Are you?
-Yes, Sensei!

14:19.066 --> 14:21.026
All right? Junbi stance.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.196
Now,

14:25.072 --> 14:27.283
I understand
you wanna defeat your enemies.

14:27.783 --> 14:28.617
And you will

14:29.743 --> 14:31.579
when it matters.

14:32.788 --> 14:35.833
Until then,
just stay focused on your training.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.126
Is that understood?

14:37.626 --> 14:38.669
Yes, Sensei.

14:39.461 --> 14:40.921
With conviction.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.339
Yes, Sensei!

14:43.215 --> 14:44.049
Good.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.718
Arms out.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.219
Attention. <i>Chae-ryut.</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:48.596
<i>Kyun-Nae.</i>

14:49.597 --> 14:50.472
Dismissed.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.647
I think you and I
need to have a little chat.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.694
Second sensei's
working us hard today.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.738
Guy's going beast mode!

15:06.947 --> 15:09.408
Sucks we can't give a beat down
before the tournament.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.287
Just because we can't fight
doesn't mean we can't get payback.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.333
So what do you have in mind?

15:26.592 --> 15:28.093
Oh, hey. Good timing.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.638
Think I've got a counter
to LaRusso's bread-and-butter.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.724
Watch this.
I make like I'm gonna walk into it again.

15:33.807 --> 15:37.102
At the last second, I slip under,
shoulder check him in the balls,

15:37.186 --> 15:39.688
take him to the mat, elbow, elbow, elbow.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.190
Point. Lawrence, winner.

15:41.857 --> 15:42.733
Got ya.

15:42.816 --> 15:46.153
All right. Here, you be him
so I can try this at game speed.

15:48.864 --> 15:49.907
Gonna help me win or what?

15:51.700 --> 15:53.744
Honestly,
I wish you weren't fighting at all.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.246
Yeah. Well, too bad, 'cause it's go time.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.958
You'll thank me
when we're done with the kata crap

15:59.041 --> 16:00.834
and I can prepare you
for an actual  fight.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.629
So if you win, we train Eagle Fang.
There's no Miyagi-Do?

16:03.712 --> 16:04.797
You got it, Pontiac.

16:06.256 --> 16:11.011
But what if I… don't want
to stop learning Miyagi-Do?

16:13.222 --> 16:15.683
What the hell are you saying?
You want him to win?

16:15.766 --> 16:20.145
No. I… Well, I guess the way I see it,
no matter who wins, nobody wins.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.480
Somebody always wins.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.233
That's how fights work. All right?

16:24.316 --> 16:27.319
No matter what ancient philosophical
bullshit LaRusso's been feeding you.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.533
Okay, Sensei.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.536
Well, good luck.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.801
<i>I didn't want it to come to this.</i>

16:51.301 --> 16:53.053
I've tried to do the right thing.

16:53.137 --> 16:56.432
I thought if we taught together,
we could make the kids stronger.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.443
<i>I tried to put aside the past.</i>

17:16.452 --> 17:18.370
You oughta watch
where you're sitting, pal.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.667
You wanna go now? Come on!

17:23.751 --> 17:25.961
<i>It's a matter of time</i>
<i>before somebody gets hurt.</i>

17:35.596 --> 17:37.473
<i>His ideas are dangerous.</i>

17:42.102 --> 17:43.103
<i>For my students,</i>

17:44.063 --> 17:45.355
<i>for my daughter,</i>

17:45.939 --> 17:48.233
<i>fighting him is the only way</i>
<i>to move forward.</i>

17:48.817 --> 17:51.653
And if I'm wrong,
I just hope that you'll forgive me.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.241
Can I get you started
with something from the bar?

17:56.325 --> 17:57.618
Yeah, Cutty and water.

17:58.786 --> 18:01.622
Scratch that.
Bring us whatever bottle of scotch

18:01.705 --> 18:03.499
your boss has stashed
for special occasions.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.127
-You don't have to do that.
-I know.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.966
So, what did you want to talk about?

18:13.050 --> 18:15.469
I want you to know
I'm glad you came on board,

18:16.095 --> 18:19.807
but I wanna make sure
that we're both on the same page.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.310
These things
that you're teaching my students,

18:24.853 --> 18:26.814
well, they're a little confusing.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.025
Cobra Kai never backs down from a fight.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.778
Tournament or no tournament.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.364
We always strike first.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.658
But you already did.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.745
-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about Robby Keene.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.791
You never told me
his father was Johnny Lawrence.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.252
-Well, what's it matter?
-What's it matter?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.629
You stole the man's son.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.216
If that's not a direct attack,
I don't know what is.

18:54.758 --> 18:58.011
Now you've got him and the kids
wrapped up in all your old drama.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.932
If you're not careful, it's gonna
take Cobra Kai down all over again.

19:02.015 --> 19:05.269
I've got everything under control.
Including Robby.

19:05.352 --> 19:09.648
No offense, John, but that's not
how it looks from where I'm sitting.

19:09.731 --> 19:10.899
It wasn't long ago

19:11.441 --> 19:14.486
where you were sitting
was at a vegan tofu brunch.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.826
You were right about me, John.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.122
I was living a lie.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.292
I lost who I was along the way.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.085
But now?

19:32.087 --> 19:34.464
Now there's nothing I want more

19:34.548 --> 19:37.134
than a second chance
at finishing what we started.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.971
I just wanna make sure this time we win.

19:41.054 --> 19:44.349
And the only way to do that
is to forget about the past.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.059
Focus on our students.

19:46.643 --> 19:49.104
We do that,
everything else will fall into place.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.357
LaRusso will have to shut down Miyagi-Do.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.651
And Johnny Lawrence

19:55.360 --> 19:57.779
will rue the day he ever left Cobra Kai.

20:01.033 --> 20:01.867
So,

20:03.118 --> 20:04.077
what do you say?

20:06.705 --> 20:07.581
I say…

20:10.125 --> 20:11.919
we've got a victory in our future.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.516
-Hey, Rico, you good?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.352
Tattoo shop's closed for the day.

20:29.770 --> 20:30.604
Hey.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.733
-Where'd you think you're going?

20:45.619 --> 20:47.996
You weren't that hard to find,
you little bitch.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.000
You assholes just ignoring
the no-fighting rules?

20:53.252 --> 20:55.170
-Oh, we're not here to fight.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.605
He's here! He's here, he's here!

21:14.314 --> 21:16.692
Anything you wanna say
to the camera, Sensei Lawrence?

21:17.192 --> 21:18.902
Anything you wanna say before the fight?

21:18.986 --> 21:21.154
Sensei Lawrence, anything you wanna say?

21:24.491 --> 21:25.993
What are all the kids doing here?

21:27.536 --> 21:31.039
That's what happens when you broadcast
your life all over social media.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.669
Maybe there's a better way.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.338
There is. You just won't admit it.

21:40.424 --> 21:43.969
Don't you ever think
you might be wrong about anything?

21:45.262 --> 21:46.972
What are we doing here?

21:47.681 --> 21:51.393
Wanna rehash your baseless argument
from last night in front of these kids?

21:51.476 --> 21:54.313
No. I want what's best for them.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.982
What's best for them is Miyagi-Do.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.776
If fighting you
is the only way I can get there,

21:59.860 --> 22:01.194
let's just get this done.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.614
All right, LaRusso.

22:05.741 --> 22:06.742
Let's finish this.

22:14.833 --> 22:15.667
Face us.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.169
Bow.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.379
Face each other.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.008
Bow.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.518
Ready!

22:34.936 --> 22:37.856
-Fight!

22:40.609 --> 22:41.777
Point, Lawrence.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.447
Sensei Lawrence strikes first!

22:45.530 --> 22:47.991
True to the motto
painted on his former dojo wall,

22:48.075 --> 22:49.910
and carved into his very being.

22:51.244 --> 22:54.206
What? I'm trying
to capture the spirit of th-the thing.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.169
Score, 1-0 Lawrence.

22:59.795 --> 23:00.629
Ready!

23:01.922 --> 23:03.006
Fight!

23:09.554 --> 23:10.472
Point, LaRusso!

23:17.979 --> 23:18.980
Score is 1-1.

23:19.064 --> 23:19.898
Ready!

23:20.982 --> 23:21.942
Fight!

23:33.245 --> 23:35.914
Hell yeah! Two-to-one.
LaRusso takes the lead.

23:35.997 --> 23:39.167
All he has to do is score one more point
and LaRusso is the winner.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.506
Score is 2-1 LaRusso.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.299
Ready!

23:53.432 --> 23:54.307
Fight!

24:02.482 --> 24:03.483
What the hell, man?

24:09.698 --> 24:10.615
Point, Lawrence!

24:14.953 --> 24:16.663
Got any more dirty tricks up your sleeve?

24:16.746 --> 24:18.457
I'm not the one who fights dirty.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.127
Score is 2-2.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.422
Next point wins.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.549
Ready!

24:28.758 --> 24:29.926
Fight!

24:37.934 --> 24:40.437
-Ooh!

24:56.453 --> 24:58.163
Ooh!

24:58.246 --> 24:59.956
-Point, Lawrence!
-Point, LaRusso!

25:00.707 --> 25:02.209
-Are you sure?
-Are <i>you </i>sure?

25:03.376 --> 25:04.753
Check the replay!

25:13.261 --> 25:14.387
Go to another angle.

25:15.722 --> 25:16.932
There is no other angle.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.184
Don't you guys
have another phone?

25:19.768 --> 25:20.602
Hawk?

25:22.604 --> 25:24.356
Shit. Eli, what happened?

25:36.660 --> 25:37.619
Who did this?

25:38.703 --> 25:39.538
Cobra Kai.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.377
Kreese and Silver did this.
They need to pay.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.836
Jesus, Johnny. Please.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.923
Kreese tried to kill you.
You wanna fight them both?

25:50.006 --> 25:51.216
Damn right. Look what they did.

25:51.299 --> 25:53.718
Dousing the fire with gasoline,
that's your answer?

25:53.802 --> 25:55.971
-Why am I not surprised?
-Sensei, stop.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.056
You still think your way is the only way.

25:58.682 --> 26:02.060
You were so proud when they pulled
their little sprinkler prank.

26:02.936 --> 26:06.147
If they kicked ass like I taught them,
this never would've happened.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.692
If they fight every time they're provoked,
where does that lead?

26:08.775 --> 26:11.027
Back to the hospital? Or to jail?

26:11.111 --> 26:13.738
-Just 'cause you spent time in both--
-Enough, Dad.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.199
-What?
-Johnny's right.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.244
It doesn't matter how many times
we stand up to Cobra Kai,

26:19.327 --> 26:21.871
if we don't strike back,
they're gonna keep coming at us.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.586
And you were worried
about my influence on your kids?

26:28.461 --> 26:29.713
Is this what you want, Johnny?

26:30.213 --> 26:34.301
To have my daughter and the rest
of my students acting like you?

26:37.345 --> 26:39.431
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

26:40.473 --> 26:41.391
'Cause we're done.

26:43.393 --> 26:44.394
Works for me.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.733
Eagle Fangs, let's go.
