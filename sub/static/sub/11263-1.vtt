your favorite decorations, too.

22:41.125 --> 22:43.583
Come back to me.

23:13.250 --> 23:14.458
What can I do?

23:16.666 --> 23:17.500
Nothing.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.291
We're just...

23:19.291 --> 23:20.458
Waiting now.

23:22.041 --> 23:23.541
This was probably--

23:24.458 --> 23:26.625
I brought some books.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.583
I thought I might
help you restock,

23:30.583 --> 23:31.791

to him--

23:31.791 --> 23:32.958
or I could.

23:32.958 --> 23:34.875
I actually don't have
that much going on right now--

23:34.875 --> 23:35.916
Wait a minute,

23:35.916 --> 23:37.833
not much going on?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.125
In your emails,

23:39.125 --> 23:41.750
you mentioned all that work
you were doing on the road.

23:42.166 --> 23:43.166
I'm back now.

23:43.166 --> 23:45.000

Buy you lunch?

You know, there is one thing.

23:54.458 --> 23:56.416
I don't know
if Charlie remembered

23:56.416 --> 23:58.333
to lock up before he left.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.625
Just give me your keys,
I'll stop by tonight,

and I'll bring you back
some dinner, too.

has that handled, but...

24:05.750 --> 24:09.125
I do think I want to
head down to the cafeteria

very bad for me.

33:55.083 --> 33:56.250
and I just thought,

33:56.250 --> 33:57.708
this needs
a wider audience,

33:57.708 --> 33:58.666
so...

33:58.666 --> 34:00.583
Would you know
how to get the word out?

34:00.583 --> 34:01.875
Yeah. 100%.

34:01.875 --> 34:02.833
Where do I sign up?

34:04.791 --> 34:06.083
So, you're playing Lucky.

34:06.083 --> 34:07.916
It's really not what you think.

34:07.916 --> 34:09.083
Oh, come on.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.333
Today, it's back-up
for someone else,

34:10.333 --> 34:12.125
and tomorrow, you're--

34:12.125 --> 34:13.250
(together):
--Setting the world on fire.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.416
(laughing)

34:16.875 --> 34:18.541
You still believe it?

34:19.541 --> 34:20.583
I never doubted your talent,

34:20.583 --> 34:22.166
or that you'd end up
where you want to be.

34:26.708 --> 34:28.666
You, um...

34:28.666 --> 34:29.708
Gotta go?

34:30.791 --> 34:32.000
Uh, yeah, I do,

34:32.000 --> 34:33.208
but, uh, could I get--

34:33.208 --> 34:34.125
you want my number
for The Bridge stuff--

34:34.125 --> 34:35.125
Yeah.
Is it the same?

34:35.125 --> 34:36.916
-Yeah.
-I got it.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.416
(chuckles fondly)

35:01.875 --> 35:03.458
There she is.

35:04.541 --> 35:05.458
Preston.

35:07.291 --> 35:08.250
Your dad had
a two-day conference

35:08.250 --> 35:09.583
in Nashville.

35:09.583 --> 35:10.916
He sent me
in his place.

35:10.916 --> 35:12.583
Wasn't that thoughtful?

35:12.583 --> 35:13.750
Super.

35:13.750 --> 35:15.375
I figured it'd give us
a minute away from Seattle,

35:15.375 --> 35:18.416
and you've talked
about this place enough.

35:19.916 --> 35:21.833
Why'd you come here anyway?

35:21.833 --> 35:22.750
I'm still pushing

35:22.750 --> 35:23.833
that radio station
deal through, so...

35:23.833 --> 35:24.833
Yeah.

35:24.833 --> 35:26.083
So...

35:26.083 --> 35:27.083
We could do dinner?

35:27.958 --> 35:29.208
Or be part of the conference.

35:29.208 --> 35:32.791
I'm gonna take
some time to myself.

35:32.791 --> 35:34.333
Actually, I'm beat.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.875
I'm gonna turn in.

35:35.875 --> 35:37.166
Oh, yeah. Sure.

35:37.166 --> 35:38.375
Sure.

35:41.333 --> 35:42.333
Good night.

35:42.333 --> 35:43.541
Good night.

35:48.541 --> 35:51.583
If you're asking
if I sent Preston down there

35:51.583 --> 35:53.625
after you left without
telling me where you were going,

35:53.625 --> 35:54.666
and after
you went back to a town

35:54.666 --> 35:56.000
you said you were
never going back to,

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
then yes,

35:57.000 --> 35:58.791
I did.

35:58.791 --> 36:01.583
I'm your father, Molly,
and I'm concerned for you.

36:01.583 --> 36:04.166
What, that whole speech
is emotional blackmail.

36:04.166 --> 36:06.750
Molly, what are you really
doing in Franklin?

36:06.750 --> 36:08.333
Tell the truth.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.958
I'm-I'm tired, Dad.

36:10.958 --> 36:12.041
I'll call you tomorrow.

36:12.041 --> 36:13.333
Good night.

I'm seeing Donna later,

37:11.750 --> 37:12.916
do you want me
to take it to her?

37:12.916 --> 37:13.916
-Would you?
-Yeah.

Bye.

37:32.708 --> 37:33.708
(sighs)

37:33.708 --> 37:37.583
I still remember
when Lonnie first moved here

37:37.583 --> 37:39.458
to work in the music business.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.458
You remember everybody.

37:41.458 --> 37:43.791
Charlie's the one
with the real memory.

37:44.916 --> 37:47.958
He'd be so touched to see
how kind everyone is being.

37:47.958 --> 37:49.958
Maybe he does.

37:52.416 --> 37:54.625
Hey, how did you
and Charlie meet anyway?

37:54.625 --> 37:56.000
Fighting over a book.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.583
(laughs)

37:57.583 --> 38:00.833
At the opposite kind of
bookstore from The Bridge.

38:00.833 --> 38:01.875
Who won?

38:01.875 --> 38:02.875
Me.

38:02.875 --> 38:04.791
Right.

38:04.791 --> 38:06.958
But he leveraged it
into a date,

38:06.958 --> 38:08.958
so he says he won.

38:15.458 --> 38:19.666
Did you know that Charlie
was the one right away?

38:21.416 --> 38:24.166
(sighs)

38:24.166 --> 38:27.708
I could see his heart
from that first minute.

38:29.625 --> 38:32.000
He had me from go.

38:34.958 --> 38:37.500
I still feel that way
when I see him.

38:38.791 --> 38:39.750
Every day.

38:41.291 --> 38:45.333
I think that anyone
who ever gets to feel that way

38:45.333 --> 38:47.875
is very lucky.

38:49.208 --> 38:51.000
Don't you agree?

38:52.166 --> 38:54.166
(quietly) Yup.

39:28.583 --> 39:30.083
I think I know
how to save The Bridge.

39:30.083 --> 39:31.125
Can I come in?

39:31.125 --> 39:32.125
Yeah, yeah, come on.

39:32.125 --> 39:33.416
The store is a testament

39:33.416 --> 39:35.291
to Donna and Charlie's love,

39:35.291 --> 39:37.833
both of books,
and of each other,

39:37.833 --> 39:40.708
and they use that love
to connect people

39:40.708 --> 39:42.416
and help them become
who they're meant to be.

39:42.416 --> 39:43.625
You know?

39:43.625 --> 39:45.583

it's 'cause I was 18,

39:45.583 --> 39:46.625

know any better,

39:46.625 --> 39:47.666
but last night,

39:47.666 --> 39:48.708
I was looking
at the website,

39:48.708 --> 39:51.750
and it helped me
remember that magic

39:51.750 --> 39:53.375
that allowed customers
to find those stories,

39:53.375 --> 39:56.291
and the people that were
meant to change their lives.

39:56.291 --> 39:58.250
And I just feel like,

39:58.250 --> 39:59.916
if we could get that out there,

39:59.916 --> 40:01.375
that people could
rally around that,

40:01.375 --> 40:02.666
and they would
want to save it, too,

40:02.666 --> 40:03.666
do you know
what I mean?

40:03.666 --> 40:05.083
So, social media, then?

40:05.083 --> 40:06.000
Exactly.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.250
And you've seen
the website.

40:07.250 --> 40:08.583
It's prehistoric.

40:08.583 --> 40:09.875
They're not on Twitter,
or Instagram,

40:09.875 --> 40:11.916
or even Facebook, I think.

40:11.916 --> 40:12.875
(chuckling)

40:12.875 --> 40:13.791
What?

40:13.791 --> 40:16.250
I'm just picturing
Charlie on Facebook.

40:16.250 --> 40:18.750
Yeah. (laughs)

40:18.750 --> 40:19.666
Maybe we can access
an old database

40:19.666 --> 40:20.875
for a mailing list?

40:20.875 --> 40:23.000
And then Donna could help
with the customer files.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.583
I could go by
the hospital, and...

40:24.583 --> 40:25.708
I could come with you.

40:25.708 --> 40:27.458
If that's okay.

40:27.458 --> 40:28.833
Yeah.

40:28.833 --> 40:30.458
Yeah, yeah, we always did
work well together.

40:30.458 --> 40:32.000
Yeah, we did.

40:38.208 --> 40:39.291
A Twitter account?

40:39.291 --> 40:40.291
We'll create it.

40:40.291 --> 40:41.625
Or Molly will,

40:41.625 --> 40:43.916
because I have no idea
what I'm talking about.

40:43.916 --> 40:44.833
(chuckling)

40:44.833 --> 40:47.750
But we an post updates
on the store and Charlie.

40:47.750 --> 40:48.791
How is he doing?

40:48.791 --> 40:49.916
Well, the doctor says

40:49.916 --> 40:52.291
he's a little more responsive
every day.

40:52.291 --> 40:54.208
That's great.

40:54.208 --> 40:55.875
We just want him
to have

40:55.875 --> 40:58.000
something promising
to come home to.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.958
Charlie would like the way
you keep saying "we".

41:01.458 --> 41:02.625
We always knew

41:02.625 --> 41:04.625
things would change,

41:04.625 --> 41:06.458
but Charlie always insisted

41:06.458 --> 41:08.625
that people would still want to
hold a book in their hands,

41:08.625 --> 41:09.666
you know?

41:09.666 --> 41:11.250
Turn down the pages,

41:11.250 --> 41:13.166
pass them down.

41:13.166 --> 41:16.625
That's why we kept
hosting events.

41:16.625 --> 41:19.833
It's about the people,
he'd always say,

41:19.833 --> 41:22.166
keeping the community together.

41:23.333 --> 41:24.583
"Community."

41:24.583 --> 41:26.166
That's it.

41:26.166 --> 41:27.541
I've got an idea.

41:27.541 --> 41:29.958
It's a little
old school, but...

41:29.958 --> 41:31.166
Do you wanna
come with me?

41:31.166 --> 41:32.166
Sure.

41:32.166 --> 41:34.000
Come on.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.833
All the main street businesses
benefit from each other.

41:36.833 --> 41:39.500
We figured maybe local shops
could help get the word out.

41:39.500 --> 41:40.666
Tell people about it,

41:40.666 --> 41:42.125
put it in a promotion
or donate.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.166
Charlie and Donna
are the sweetest,

41:44.166 --> 41:45.083
most wonderful people,

41:45.083 --> 41:47.708
but we were hit
by the storm, too,

41:47.708 --> 41:49.208
and I really don't have
anything to offer--

41:50.250 --> 41:51.333
Thanks.

41:51.333 --> 41:53.291
If anything changes--

41:53.291 --> 41:54.208
Can I ask...

41:54.208 --> 41:55.833
A lot of the flowers
that people brought

41:55.833 --> 41:56.875
to put outside The Bridge,

41:56.875 --> 41:57.958
they came from
your shop, didn't they?

41:57.958 --> 41:58.791
Yeah.

41:58.791 --> 42:00.000
Do you think

42:00.000 --> 42:01.333
you could put aside
a portion of the sales

42:01.333 --> 42:02.291
for Charlie's recovery?

42:03.666 --> 42:05.208
That I could do.

42:05.208 --> 42:07.166
That's great.

42:07.166 --> 42:08.916
Thank you.

42:08.916 --> 42:10.541
It wouldn't amount to much,

42:10.541 --> 42:13.333
even if I did
donate a piece.

42:13.333 --> 42:14.583
I bet Charlie
and Donna

42:14.583 --> 42:15.541
have bought
a lot of stuff here

42:15.541 --> 42:16.833
over the years.

42:16.833 --> 42:18.041
Committed customers,

42:18.041 --> 42:19.208
20 years?

42:20.791 --> 42:21.916
You some sort of
businessman now?

42:22.791 --> 42:24.833
Not even close.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.541
Maybe you can't
donate money,

42:26.541 --> 42:27.625
but do you have books?

42:27.625 --> 42:29.791
The store needs
to be restocked.

42:29.791 --> 42:31.916
Wait, The Bridge needs
books?

42:31.916 --> 42:33.916
Charlie said they were
reopening in about a week.

42:33.916 --> 42:35.708
Yeah, that's what he's
been telling people.

42:35.708 --> 42:37.208
The Bridge needs help?

42:37.208 --> 42:38.625
I'll lend a hand.

42:38.625 --> 42:40.166
I'm sure a lot of people
feel that way.

42:40.166 --> 42:42.458
Well, is there somewhere
we could gather up?

42:42.458 --> 42:45.041
We need it
to go viral, fast.

42:45.041 --> 42:47.875
Which means tapping into
people's emotions,

42:47.875 --> 42:49.583
what they love.

42:49.583 --> 42:50.750
The story of
a singular bookstore,

42:50.750 --> 42:52.000
a beloved owner
in trouble,

42:52.000 --> 42:53.416
everyone can
relate to that.

42:53.416 --> 42:54.583
Yeah,

42:54.583 --> 42:56.375
everybody has a favorite
book or bookstore.

42:56.375 --> 42:58.041
And if we can drive them
to The Bridge's website

42:58.041 --> 42:59.958
to share those feelings
and those favorites...

42:59.958 --> 43:01.125
With links to donate,

43:01.125 --> 43:03.083
and support The Bridge
and Charlie's recovery...

43:03.083 --> 43:04.875
It's everything
that Charlie was all about,

43:04.875 --> 43:06.958
bringing people together
over their love of books.

43:06.958 --> 43:08.958
I'm gonna call
my marketing department,

43:08.958 --> 43:10.583
and see if they give us
some help with this.

43:10.583 --> 43:11.958
(beeps phone on)

43:11.958 --> 43:13.958
Shoot, I need a signal.

43:13.958 --> 43:15.166
You guys keep talking.

43:17.333 --> 43:19.791
She's some go-getter.

43:25.541 --> 43:26.958
Wow, it's so weird
to be in here.

43:26.958 --> 43:28.583
You talked about
this place so often.

43:28.583 --> 43:30.791
Does it meet
your expectations?

43:30.791 --> 43:32.541
Yeah, I mean, it definitely
looks like somewhere

43:32.541 --> 43:34.291
somebody would go
to be discovered.

43:35.708 --> 43:36.708
Hey, has it been
okay for you?

43:36.708 --> 43:38.250
You said you were
on the road.

43:38.250 --> 43:39.375
Yeah, I've been making
a decent living,

43:39.375 --> 43:41.125
and working with some
great, great people, so...

43:42.666 --> 43:44.333
I just kind of hoped I'd be
somewhere else by now, I guess.

43:44.333 --> 43:45.458
Yeah.

43:45.458 --> 43:46.916
What?

43:47.875 --> 43:49.666
Oh, nothing,

43:49.666 --> 43:52.125
I just thought
that following my path

43:52.125 --> 43:53.958
might take me somewhere
different, too.

43:53.958 --> 43:56.250
Maybe someplace more rewarding.

43:56.250 --> 43:58.000
It has its rewards,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.333
but I don't know, some days,
it just feels kind of...

44:02.333 --> 44:03.458
Maybe when you're 18,

44:03.458 --> 44:05.708
you have all these big ideas,

44:05.708 --> 44:08.541
and then reality sets in, and...

44:10.416 --> 44:11.333
Do you really believe that?

44:11.333 --> 44:12.500
No.

44:12.500 --> 44:13.875
(laughs)

44:13.875 --> 44:15.458
Being here, and helping
people who need it,

44:15.458 --> 44:18.500
it just feels so much more
like what I thought...

44:18.500 --> 44:19.583
It would,

44:19.583 --> 44:21.916
than being part of
a big company.

44:21.916 --> 44:23.541
I just feel like
I could do so much good.

44:27.583 --> 44:28.791
Are you still writing songs?

44:28.791 --> 44:30.791
Yeah, I just, uh...
Started again recently.

44:30.791 --> 44:32.208
Really?

44:32.208 --> 44:33.250
Yeah.

44:33.250 --> 44:34.083
That's great--

44:34.083 --> 44:35.291
Hey, Ry,
you're up.

44:35.291 --> 44:36.333
Great, uh...

44:36.333 --> 44:38.208
Hey, do you want to
stick around, watch the set,

44:38.208 --> 44:40.000
and then we can
catch up more after?

44:40.000 --> 44:41.125
Sure. I'd love
to hear you play.

44:41.125 --> 44:42.375
Great.

44:44.541 --> 44:45.708
You a fan?

44:45.708 --> 44:46.750
I'm an old fan.

44:46.750 --> 44:48.833
-(chuckles)
-Molly. Hi.

44:48.833 --> 44:51.291
Molly, nice
to meet you.

44:51.291 --> 44:52.333
Uh, so, yeah, um,

44:52.333 --> 44:53.791
we're right in the middle
of a shift change here,

44:53.791 --> 44:54.875
so if you could
settle up from before,

44:54.875 --> 44:57.083
then I'll have
a new waitress

44:57.083 --> 44:58.541
who will be right here.

44:58.541 --> 44:59.583
Kristen?

44:59.583 --> 45:01.208
-Molly!
-Hi!

45:01.208 --> 45:02.833
Wow, what are you doing
in Franklin?

45:02.833 --> 45:04.208
Well, The Bridge--

45:04.208 --> 45:05.041
Oh, sure--

45:05.041 --> 45:07.166
and Charlie, so...
It's just...

45:07.166 --> 45:08.500
I thought

45:08.500 --> 45:10.458
you were in Virginia.

45:10.458 --> 45:11.375
Married,
Ryan said?

45:11.375 --> 45:13.541
Uh, yeah, that didn't
work out so well.

45:13.541 --> 45:14.541
I'm sorry.

45:14.541 --> 45:15.625
It's all good.

45:15.625 --> 45:16.708
I'm here.

45:16.708 --> 45:18.916
Here? At Lucky?

45:18.916 --> 45:20.333
-Yeah.
-Right.

45:20.333 --> 45:21.583
Wow.

45:23.541 --> 45:24.750
Oh, wow, you're engaged.

45:24.750 --> 45:26.875
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

45:26.875 --> 45:28.041
Huh.

45:29.750 --> 45:31.291
You know,

45:31.291 --> 45:32.625
I just remembered.

45:32.625 --> 45:33.833
Could you tell Ryan

45:33.833 --> 45:35.875
that I forgot about
a business call

45:35.875 --> 45:36.916
I have to make to Seattle?

45:36.916 --> 45:38.250
'cause I work in Seattle--

45:38.250 --> 45:39.958
actually, I...
Well, live in Seattle.

45:39.958 --> 45:42.375
My life is, um...
Primarily, uh...

45:42.375 --> 45:43.750
In Seattle.

45:43.750 --> 45:45.708
Yeah. So...

45:45.708 --> 45:46.791
Uh, I gotta go,

45:46.791 --> 45:48.416
but if you can
just tell him,

45:48.416 --> 45:49.416
that'd be great.

45:49.416 --> 45:50.416
Yeah.

45:50.416 --> 45:52.000

You okay?

46:10.875 --> 46:11.958
Yeah.

46:11.958 --> 46:12.958
Yeah, how was the conference?

It was great.
Great...

Listen, I was just
about to go for a workout,

46:16.875 --> 46:17.791

46:17.791 --> 46:19.458
Sure.

Great.

46:49.500 --> 46:54.375
It's crazy that
all these years later,

46:54.375 --> 46:56.166
I'm doing exactly
what I want to do,

46:56.166 --> 46:58.708
with exactly the people
I want to do it with.

46:58.708 --> 46:59.875
There's only
one more thing

46:59.875 --> 47:03.166
that would make me even happier.

47:04.791 --> 47:06.583
Marry me.

47:08.708 --> 47:11.083
I didn't expect
to be doing this

47:11.083 --> 47:12.875
in my workout clothes,

47:12.875 --> 47:14.041
and the ring is in my room,

47:14.041 --> 47:15.041
but the moment felt right, and--

47:15.041 --> 47:17.708
Oh, Preston--

47:19.833 --> 47:24.250
"Oh, Preston... Yes?"

47:27.083 --> 47:28.083
I'm sorry.

47:28.083 --> 47:29.083
I love you...

47:29.083 --> 47:30.666
(quietly) No.

47:33.833 --> 47:37.208
Yes, you do, Molly.

47:37.208 --> 47:40.166
We've been together for...

47:43.583 --> 47:44.625
But I waited,

47:44.625 --> 47:46.708
and if you didn't...

47:46.708 --> 47:48.125
What have we been doing?

47:48.125 --> 47:49.583
I should have said
something earlier,

47:49.583 --> 47:51.375
I just...

47:52.750 --> 47:53.916
It's being
back in Franklin, I...

47:53.916 --> 47:55.208
What is it with this place?

47:55.208 --> 47:57.208
Everything you love
is in Seattle.

47:57.208 --> 47:59.583
Your father,
your friends, your work,

47:59.583 --> 48:01.375
me.

48:02.958 --> 48:05.875
There's a whole life
waiting for you.

48:05.875 --> 48:07.083
It's not a life
that I chose.

48:07.083 --> 48:10.416
Being back here, I realize

48:10.416 --> 48:12.708
that I can't commit
to a job,

48:12.708 --> 48:14.875
let alone a marriage,

48:14.875 --> 48:17.166
before I figure out

48:17.166 --> 48:20.583
what I'm supposed to be like
on my own.

48:22.125 --> 48:23.416
I'm sorry.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.250
You've always known

48:26.250 --> 48:27.458
what you were meant for,

48:27.458 --> 48:31.333
and all I'm asking for
is a chance to do that, too.

48:31.333 --> 48:33.125
Can you understand that?

48:35.750 --> 48:36.750
Preston?

48:55.791 --> 48:56.833
And the stupid thing is,

48:56.833 --> 48:58.000
ever since she's got to town,
I've felt different.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.250
Like I have
direction again.

49:00.250 --> 49:01.875
I know how to move forward.

49:01.875 --> 49:03.041
And songs?

49:03.041 --> 49:04.958
They've been flying out of me.

49:04.958 --> 49:06.041
Good ones.

49:06.041 --> 49:10.291
I have been waiting
a long time for this.

53:10.916 --> 53:12.291
Guitar lessons.

53:12.291 --> 53:15.333
I wanted them so badly,
my mom bribed me.

53:15.333 --> 53:17.541
If I read a book a week,
she'd pay for them.

53:17.541 --> 53:18.750
Then I found out later,

53:18.750 --> 53:21.166
between guitar lessons
and the books,

53:21.166 --> 53:22.416
it stretched
our budget so far,

53:22.416 --> 53:24.250
that she was selling
magazines at night

53:24.250 --> 53:26.541
on the phone
after I went to bed.

53:26.541 --> 53:28.458
Wow, your mom
is something else.

53:28.458 --> 53:30.625
(chuckles) Yeah,
she's a good blackmailer.

53:30.625 --> 53:31.958
(laughs)

53:31.958 --> 53:32.916
What do you say,

53:32.916 --> 53:33.916
do you want to grab a drink
or something?

53:33.916 --> 53:36.000
Actually, I was gonna go back to
the b&amp;b

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
and work on the website--

53:37.000 --> 53:38.208
of course.

53:38.208 --> 53:39.375
Yeah, of course--

53:39.375 --> 53:42.416
but my company forbids me
from doing that.

53:42.416 --> 53:44.458
It does not, however,
forbid me

53:44.458 --> 53:47.500
from teaching
somebody else to do that.

53:48.416 --> 53:50.791
Wait, you're not
talking about...

53:50.791 --> 53:52.416
Technology?

53:52.416 --> 53:53.416
Nope, come on.

53:53.416 --> 53:54.500
(groaning)

53:54.500 --> 53:56.416
Oscar the truck,
here we come. Come on.

53:56.416 --> 53:57.375
So, click up here.

53:57.375 --> 53:58.750
Mm-hmm.

53:58.750 --> 54:00.291
Oh, the logo, yeah,
up here on the left.

54:00.291 --> 54:01.291
Yeah, no, you're good,

54:01.291 --> 54:03.750
and then, uh,
drag it down.

54:03.750 --> 54:06.041
Then you can click off,
you don't need it.

54:06.041 --> 54:07.541
And then just over there,
it will let you type.

54:07.541 --> 54:08.583
(grumbles) Oh...

54:08.583 --> 54:09.750
Yup, perfect,
go ahead.

54:09.750 --> 54:11.416
Go for it.

54:14.791 --> 54:15.666
(chuckles)

54:15.666 --> 54:17.250
Here, let's
dress it up a bit.

54:17.250 --> 54:18.208
Yeah, yeah, yeah, see?

54:18.208 --> 54:19.250
Nice.

54:19.250 --> 54:20.250
Magical.

54:20.250 --> 54:21.333
(chuckling)

54:21.333 --> 54:22.291
And then we should
probably put a counter

54:22.291 --> 54:23.708
down on
the right side, yeah.

54:23.708 --> 54:25.458
Do we still have that picture
of Charlie and Donna?

54:27.458 --> 54:28.458
And then
we're almost done,

54:28.458 --> 54:29.458
if you just want to...

54:29.458 --> 54:32.083
Yup, and then,
last key here.

54:34.500 --> 54:35.541
We're live.

54:35.541 --> 54:36.916
You did it.

54:36.916 --> 54:37.958
You did it.

54:37.958 --> 54:39.875
I just typed very badly.

54:39.875 --> 54:41.291
(laughs)

54:41.291 --> 54:43.291
Okay, so...

54:43.291 --> 54:44.541
the next thing
we should probably do--

54:44.541 --> 54:45.833
Uh, have mercy.

54:45.833 --> 54:46.875
It's 3:00 A.M.

54:46.875 --> 54:48.291
I'm starving.

54:48.291 --> 54:49.541
How are you not starving?

54:54.833 --> 54:55.958
All right,
I think we're good.

54:55.958 --> 54:57.708
Yeah? Okay.

54:57.708 --> 54:58.708
Ready?

54:58.708 --> 54:59.833
Yup.

54:59.833 --> 55:00.916
Nice.

55:00.916 --> 55:02.000
There you go.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.166
There we go.

55:03.166 --> 55:04.166
Is that enough?

55:04.166 --> 55:06.083
It's perfect.

55:06.083 --> 55:08.708
Now, for my favorite part.

55:10.375 --> 55:11.958
Mm, it smells good.

55:11.958 --> 55:13.458
It's gonna be...

55:13.458 --> 55:16.166
Taste even better.

55:22.208 --> 55:23.916
Okay, this is...

55:23.916 --> 55:25.375
This is
gonna sound crazy, but...

55:25.375 --> 55:27.000
They're really lucky,

55:27.000 --> 55:28.333
aren't they?

55:28.333 --> 55:30.500
Charlie and Donna?

55:30.500 --> 55:33.750
I mean, not what's
happening right now, but...

55:33.750 --> 55:35.166
The fact that
they spent their lives

55:35.166 --> 55:36.458
creating something that matters.

55:36.458 --> 55:37.541
They've inspired so many people.

55:39.333 --> 55:42.375
I think they're lucky because...

55:42.375 --> 55:43.875
They have each other.

55:45.458 --> 55:46.833
Yeah.

55:46.833 --> 55:48.583
Donna said

55:48.583 --> 55:49.666
it was love
at first sight

55:49.666 --> 55:50.625
fighting over a book.

55:50.625 --> 55:51.708
(chuckling)

55:51.708 --> 55:52.791
Should we
put that on there?

55:52.791 --> 55:53.916
Maybe.

55:53.916 --> 55:54.833
And then maybe

55:54.833 --> 55:56.166
other people
could talk about

55:56.166 --> 55:57.791
their own
first moments,

55:57.791 --> 55:59.625
their own love
at first sight.

55:59.625 --> 56:03.208
What do you think?

56:03.208 --> 56:05.208
Um, I think that...

56:09.166 --> 56:11.541
I think it's snowing.

56:16.125 --> 56:17.708
(chuckling shyly)

56:21.708 --> 56:23.500
What in the world
is all this?

56:23.500 --> 56:25.916
Deliveries keep coming.

56:28.083 --> 56:30.750
We could load them
in the back of my truck.

56:30.750 --> 56:32.416
We're gonna need
a fleet of trucks.

56:32.416 --> 56:33.916
(chuckling)

56:37.833 --> 56:39.041
DONNA: I don't
understand,

56:39.041 --> 56:40.458
where are all these
coming from?

56:40.458 --> 56:43.083
Ohio, Texas, California.

56:43.083 --> 56:44.541
This one's
from Canada.

56:44.541 --> 56:46.041
Why didn't you leave them
at the store?

56:46.041 --> 56:48.375
Well, no, they should
be here for when--

56:48.375 --> 56:49.250
(together):
--Charlie wakes up.

56:50.375 --> 56:51.375
5,400.

56:51.375 --> 56:52.625
Dollars?

56:52.625 --> 56:54.708
That's just
from the envelopes.

56:54.708 --> 56:58.041
But the website
is up to $14,043

56:58.041 --> 56:59.125
in just two days.

56:59.125 --> 57:00.791
No that total's wrong.

57:00.791 --> 57:03.291
It's actually $19,043.

57:03.291 --> 57:04.750
My record company

57:04.750 --> 57:05.708
heard about The Bridge,

57:05.708 --> 57:07.375
and we're donating $5,000.

57:07.375 --> 57:08.541
(cheering and clapping)

57:08.541 --> 57:09.791
What?

57:11.458 --> 57:12.458
You have
a record company?

57:12.458 --> 57:14.291
Yeah, I'm a record exec.

57:14.291 --> 57:16.791
Oh, well,
you've met Ryan kelly,

57:16.791 --> 57:18.125
musician extraordinaire, right?

57:18.125 --> 57:19.458
Mol...

57:19.458 --> 57:20.583
What?

57:20.583 --> 57:21.791
Charlie put people
together all the time.

57:21.791 --> 57:23.208
It's only fitting that
this should happen

57:23.208 --> 57:24.500
in his room.
Right, Donna?

57:24.500 --> 57:26.333
Right.

57:26.333 --> 57:27.666
Oh, great.

57:27.666 --> 57:30.750
She's here for
the ventilator.

57:30.750 --> 57:33.500
Charlie's been breathing
on his own since yesterday.

57:33.500 --> 57:34.500
(all cheering in delight)

57:34.500 --> 57:35.750
All right, Charlie!

57:37.416 --> 57:38.791
♪♪

57:42.625 --> 57:43.833
$19,000 plus $5,400--

57:43.833 --> 57:44.916
--Is amazing, but--

57:44.916 --> 57:46.500
--But still a tenth
of the downpayment

57:46.500 --> 57:47.500
on a commercial property.

57:47.500 --> 57:48.583
We still need a savior,

57:48.583 --> 57:50.291
a knight riding up
on a horse.

57:50.291 --> 57:51.625
The landlord
doesn't realize

57:51.625 --> 57:53.666
how much The Bridge's
customer base has grown,

57:53.666 --> 57:55.250
or the thousands
of followers we have

57:55.250 --> 57:56.541
on Facebook
and Twitter.

57:56.541 --> 57:57.791
Has anybody
talked to him?

57:57.791 --> 57:59.166
I nominate Molly.

57:59.166 --> 58:00.541
Oh. Yeah, sure.

58:00.541 --> 58:01.875
I just need
his information.

58:01.875 --> 58:04.000
Oh, also Jenny
is in charge of organizing

58:04.000 --> 58:05.166
the Christmas carols
for tomorrow,

58:05.166 --> 58:07.208
so everybody
talk to her, okay?

58:07.208 --> 58:08.375
Let's go.

58:08.375 --> 58:09.333
(chuckling)

58:09.333 --> 58:10.416
Phewf!

58:12.000 --> 58:12.916
Hey, man,

58:12.916 --> 58:14.666
I didn't realize
you were that Ryan Kelly

58:14.666 --> 58:16.333
till Molly said so.

58:16.333 --> 58:17.625
You got a sec?

58:17.625 --> 58:19.000
Yeah.

58:20.666 --> 58:21.916
Mr. Fellows--

58:21.916 --> 58:22.916
Fred.

58:22.916 --> 58:24.166
Fred.

58:24.166 --> 58:25.041
I'm a businesswoman,

58:25.041 --> 58:26.916
I completely
understand your issues,

58:26.916 --> 58:28.000
but The Bridge
is such--

58:28.000 --> 58:30.208
You have no idea how much
I've loved The Bridge.

58:30.208 --> 58:33.583
My wife died suddenly
eight years ago

58:33.583 --> 58:34.791
and left me with three boys.

58:34.791 --> 58:38.041
I took them to The Bridge
for books, to get a break,

58:38.041 --> 58:40.708
find books on how to raise them.

58:40.708 --> 58:43.250
But my eldest is
about to go to college.

58:43.250 --> 58:44.250
If they can't rebuild...

58:44.250 --> 58:45.833
That's my income, too.

58:45.833 --> 58:47.250
But the money keeps coming in--

58:47.250 --> 58:48.541
is it enough?

58:48.541 --> 58:49.583
For repairs?

58:49.583 --> 58:50.583
For the downpayment.

58:50.583 --> 58:53.000
Sir, they're booksellers.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.208
You know they may never have
that kind of money.

58:54.208 --> 58:56.541
It's my biggest hope
that they come up with it,

58:56.541 --> 58:59.208
but without a guarantee...

58:59.208 --> 59:00.375
It's a very nice thing

59:00.375 --> 59:02.291
that you're doing,

59:02.291 --> 59:03.291
but I can't wait.

59:03.291 --> 59:05.458
I am so sorry.

59:06.666 --> 59:08.500
Okay.

59:08.500 --> 59:09.708
I understand.

59:09.708 --> 59:11.333
Thanks for your time.

59:13.500 --> 59:14.750
You wanted to stay.

59:14.750 --> 59:16.750
I know, I just...

59:16.750 --> 59:18.750
I'm playing backup
at amateur night

59:18.750 --> 59:20.458
four hours a week.

59:20.458 --> 59:22.083
That's the only thing out there.

59:22.083 --> 59:23.625
Do you know how many musicians
would kill for this gig?

59:23.625 --> 59:25.416
I know how many have
your gifts.

59:25.416 --> 59:26.708
Zero.

59:26.708 --> 59:27.958
And you'd give it up

59:27.958 --> 59:29.333
to wind up exactly
where you are

59:29.333 --> 59:30.583
in a year, again?

59:30.583 --> 59:32.333
You were moving forward.

59:32.333 --> 59:33.500
What's the issue?

59:33.500 --> 59:35.875
What if what I've got
is as far as I'm going to get?

59:36.958 --> 59:39.125
How will you know
if you keep running away?

59:40.208 --> 59:41.916
Honey, all I want

59:41.916 --> 59:43.458
is for you to be happy,

59:43.458 --> 59:46.416
but I taught you to grab life
with both hands.

59:46.416 --> 59:47.375
"Go to Italy."

59:47.375 --> 59:48.750
Yes.

59:48.750 --> 59:50.541
No matter how long
it takes to get there.

59:50.541 --> 59:54.041
Ryan, show people who you are.

59:55.208 --> 59:57.125
Or does this have
something to do with Molly?

59:58.291 --> 59:59.416
We both know

59:59.416 --> 01:00:01.416
that's why you went on the road
in the first place.

01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:03.666
But with her
or without her,

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.583
it's time for you to decide,

01:00:05.583 --> 01:00:07.541
are you going to step up,
or not?

01:00:13.708 --> 01:00:15.791
I'm on break.

01:00:15.791 --> 01:00:18.750
You don't have to keep
bringing me things.

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:19.791
But thank you.

01:00:19.791 --> 01:00:21.208
How are you holding up?

01:00:21.208 --> 01:00:22.625
Well...

01:00:22.625 --> 01:00:24.458
You went through it with Tom.

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:26.125
I didn't go through this.

01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:28.625
You know,
I didn't mean that, I'm sorry--

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:29.958
No, I meant,

01:00:29.958 --> 01:00:32.083
I can't even begin to imagine
what you're going through.

01:00:32.083 --> 01:00:34.875
I wouldn't be
where I am today

01:00:34.875 --> 01:00:37.083
if it wasn't for you
and Charlie.

01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:40.958
You had faith.

01:00:41.875 --> 01:00:43.791
Might have made it
easier for you.

01:00:43.791 --> 01:00:45.958
I've been thinking.

01:00:45.958 --> 01:00:48.541
Maybe for you,

01:00:48.541 --> 01:00:51.833
crossing that line to faith

01:00:51.833 --> 01:00:53.000
feels like
betraying something.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.750
Something in you
hasn't forgiven,

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:55.791
or forgotten.

01:00:55.791 --> 01:00:57.458
But this isn't about you.

01:00:57.458 --> 01:00:59.333
It's about Charlie.

01:00:59.333 --> 01:01:03.333
And if you can open up,
and ask for things for him...

01:01:04.958 --> 01:01:06.333
Someone will listen?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.166
Someone's always listening.

01:01:11.416 --> 01:01:12.791
And prayer and faith

01:01:12.791 --> 01:01:18.375
aren't necessarily found
in houses of worship.

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:19.458
They're in your heart.

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:23.416
And you've always had
that faith in Charlie.

01:01:23.416 --> 01:01:24.583
Maybe,
if you wanted,

01:01:24.583 --> 01:01:27.000
you could access it that way.

01:01:29.416 --> 01:01:30.875
Thank you.

01:01:40.291 --> 01:01:41.708
You came.

01:01:41.708 --> 01:01:43.541
To your debut at Lucky?
Are you kidding?

01:01:43.541 --> 01:01:45.833
Well, it's amateur night,
so don't expect too much.

01:01:45.833 --> 01:01:47.958
Okay, first of all,
you are not an amateur,

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:50.250
and I've already heard
your music, so...

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:51.541
How do you feel?

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:52.875
I'm petrified, yeah.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.333
I play backup, so it's--

01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:56.291
Not anymore.

01:01:56.291 --> 01:01:57.416
You're up.

01:01:57.416 --> 01:01:58.458
Oh, boy.

01:01:58.458 --> 01:02:00.666
(laughs)

01:02:00.666 --> 01:02:02.166
Hey, Mol...

01:02:02.166 --> 01:02:06.333
Merry Christmas Eve-Eve.

01:02:06.333 --> 01:02:08.000
Hey, everyone!

01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:11.041
Let's have a big Lucky welcome

01:02:11.041 --> 01:02:12.583
for Ryan kelly!

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:14.375
(cheering and applause)

01:02:17.708 --> 01:02:18.875
So, I'm Ryan kelly...

01:02:18.875 --> 01:02:20.750
Whoo!

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:21.791
Thanks.

01:02:21.791 --> 01:02:23.708
It's good to see you guys, too.

01:02:23.708 --> 01:02:25.833
So, you probably all heard about
The Bridge bookstore,

01:02:25.833 --> 01:02:26.833
and its owner, Charlie Bartons,

01:02:26.833 --> 01:02:28.208
who was in an accident
last week.

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:29.750
Ever since,
I've been writing songs

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:31.791
about a bookseller
and his patrons

01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:33.708
each one with a story to tell.

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:35.958
But this was
the first one I wrote.

01:02:35.958 --> 01:02:37.416
It's about lost love.

01:02:40.458 --> 01:02:42.041

I'd jump out of an airplane...

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:56.666
Beg for mercy.

01:03:58.708 --> 01:04:02.750
So please...

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:07.000
I'm following his lead here.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.875
Please...

01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:14.208

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.833
Whoo!

01:04:24.833 --> 01:04:26.875
Ryan kelly, everyone!

01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:28.416
Local boy.

01:04:28.416 --> 01:04:30.291
Ryan Kelly!

01:04:35.208 --> 01:04:36.708
(knocking on door)

01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:38.625
Donna...

01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:39.958
Come quick.

01:04:39.958 --> 01:04:42.416
Charlie moved his hand.

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:47.458
Ryan...

01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:49.625
That was incredible.

01:04:49.625 --> 01:04:50.916
I've been bottling it up.

01:04:50.916 --> 01:04:51.958
You are a songwriter.

01:04:51.958 --> 01:04:53.083
You're amazing, you know that?

01:04:53.083 --> 01:04:55.333
Nothing's changed, because...

01:04:55.333 --> 01:04:57.041
Music just flows out of me
when I'm around you.

01:04:57.041 --> 01:04:58.916
What?

01:04:58.916 --> 01:05:02.000
Are you happy, Molly?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.416
Has your 10-year plan
worked out?

01:05:03.416 --> 01:05:06.375
You probably don't remember
that video we made--

01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:09.125
Actually,
I watch it every December.

01:05:11.833 --> 01:05:16.083
I know you're following
the life plan that you had,

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:18.833
I just have to ask...

01:05:18.833 --> 01:05:20.083
You're not wearing your ring,

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.416
did something
change, or...?

01:05:22.416 --> 01:05:24.375
Ryan, listen,
if I tell you something--

01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:25.625
Hey, did you
hear that crowd?

01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:26.791
Did you hear
that crowd?

01:05:26.791 --> 01:05:27.791
Yeah, yeah,
it was, uh...

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:29.458
You can come
back here anytime.

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:30.791
I mean, if that
Pacific Rim Tour

01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:31.916
doesn't keep you
away from us.

01:05:31.916 --> 01:05:33.791
Great set.

01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:35.791
Great set...

01:05:37.083 --> 01:05:38.000
You're going back on the road?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.083
No, no--

01:05:39.083 --> 01:05:40.041
No, it's okay.
Ryan, it's okay.

01:05:40.041 --> 01:05:41.125
I'm happy for you.

01:05:41.125 --> 01:05:42.458
What were you about to say?

01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:45.625
I've got to get out of here
after this, um...

01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:46.875
To pack,

01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:48.666
and I'm going back
to Seattle tomorrow.

01:05:48.666 --> 01:05:50.500
It's Christmas Eve.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.666
To your fiance.

01:05:51.666 --> 01:05:53.125
Right.

01:05:56.166 --> 01:05:57.708
Bye, Ryan.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.541
You hung up on me.

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:17.750
Yeah.

01:06:20.083 --> 01:06:22.875
Molly...

01:06:22.875 --> 01:06:23.958
I told you I'd come down--

01:06:23.958 --> 01:06:25.166
What do you want?
You want me home?

01:06:25.166 --> 01:06:26.916
I'm flying home tomorrow.
It's Christmas Eve.

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:31.166
You don't talk to me like that.

01:06:31.166 --> 01:06:33.250
No, I don't.

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:35.000
I do everything I'm told.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.666
I hop to,
that's the kind of girl I am.

01:06:37.666 --> 01:06:38.541
What's come over you?

01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:41.833
Except now.
I quit.

01:06:41.833 --> 01:06:43.125
You quit?

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:45.166
I quit Callens Media.

01:06:45.166 --> 01:06:46.916
I don't want to be CEO anymore.

01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:49.250
Good night, Dad.

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:52.250
Thanks for coming.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.791
Have you been drinking?

01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:07.083
I'm completely clear.

01:07:07.083 --> 01:07:08.541
I'm just, I'm done.

01:07:08.541 --> 01:07:10.958
I can't follow
the plan anymore.

01:07:10.958 --> 01:07:12.541
What is going on with you?

01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:14.875
Tonight, I went to this bar,
called Lucky,

01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:15.875
and Ryan, he--

01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:17.416
-Ryan?
-He followed through.

01:07:17.416 --> 01:07:19.166
He played his own music
in this bar that he always--

01:07:19.166 --> 01:07:20.291
This is about Ryan?

01:07:20.291 --> 01:07:21.708
Would you just listen?

01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:25.375
He followed
his heart, and...

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.375
He was ridiculously amazing,

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:29.500
and the look
on his face was just...

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.708
He...

01:07:31.708 --> 01:07:33.333
By doing this,

01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:35.625
he became the person
that he was meant to be.

01:07:35.625 --> 01:07:37.083
Wait,

01:07:37.083 --> 01:07:38.250
you're giving
everything up

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:39.291
because of him?

01:07:39.291 --> 01:07:41.375
Look, I'm not
with him, okay?

01:07:41.375 --> 01:07:42.500
He doesn't want me,

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.500
and it's about more than that.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.708
It's about
what he inspired in me.

01:07:46.708 --> 01:07:48.125
It's about
who I'm supposed to be.

01:07:48.125 --> 01:07:50.875
I really need you
to understand this.

01:07:50.875 --> 01:07:55.416
Dad, I've always done
everything you wanted.

01:07:55.416 --> 01:07:58.333
I learned
the business.

01:07:58.333 --> 01:08:00.250
I transferred
from Belmont to Stanford

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.250
after my first semester--

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.625
That was your choice.

01:08:02.625 --> 01:08:03.458
Dad, please--

01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:06.916
You said you had nothing left
after that boy broke your heart.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.250
He knew

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.333
that you were
better off with Preston,

01:08:09.333 --> 01:08:10.666
or he wouldn't
have done it.

01:08:10.666 --> 01:08:12.291
Dad--

01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:14.750
wait, how could he...

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:17.166
Ryan knew that
you belonged with Preston,

01:08:17.166 --> 01:08:19.166
and that is why he broke it off.

01:08:19.166 --> 01:08:20.541
How would he have known?

01:08:21.791 --> 01:08:24.041
I never talked to him
about Preston.

01:08:24.041 --> 01:08:25.916
The only way he would have known
would have been if...

01:08:32.457 --> 01:08:35.125
That Christmas Eve...

01:08:35.125 --> 01:08:37.791
What did you do?

01:08:37.791 --> 01:08:38.875
I protected you.

01:08:38.875 --> 01:08:40.875
You called him?

01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:41.875
What did you say?

01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:45.125
I said you had
a life in Seattle,

01:08:45.125 --> 01:08:46.625
and he wasn't
part of it.

01:08:46.625 --> 01:08:47.875
Why?

01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:50.332
So I could come back
and run a corporation

01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:51.707
and marry a man
that I don't love?

01:08:51.707 --> 01:08:52.582
You did this!

01:08:52.582 --> 01:08:54.207
So you would have
the right life!

01:08:54.207 --> 01:08:56.666
How would you know what that is
when you never let me find out?

01:08:59.625 --> 01:09:01.166
He probably thought
I never loved him at all.

01:09:01.166 --> 01:09:02.166
Molly...

01:09:02.166 --> 01:09:03.166
No, no, no, no.

01:09:03.166 --> 01:09:05.207
We are so done.

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:08.291
You are going to
install Preston as CEO,

01:09:08.291 --> 01:09:09.832
and hand over
my inheritance to me,

01:09:09.832 --> 01:09:11.666
or I swear
I will leave Seattle for good.

01:09:11.666 --> 01:09:14.957
I couldn't change
the inheritance

01:09:14.957 --> 01:09:16.125
even if I wanted to.

01:09:16.125 --> 01:09:18.250
And if you don't
take over as CEO,

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:20.916
you're never going to
see that money.

01:09:20.916 --> 01:09:22.582
I get that you wanted
to save this bookstore,

01:09:22.582 --> 01:09:24.791
or whatever lark it is
that you're on,

01:09:24.791 --> 01:09:27.291
but you're never

01:09:27.291 --> 01:09:29.666
going to be this store's
white knight.

01:09:41.166 --> 01:09:42.916
Yes, I will.

01:09:42.916 --> 01:09:44.166
Watch me.

01:09:44.166 --> 01:09:45.207
Molly--

01:09:45.207 --> 01:09:48.207
You said
you did all this for me.

01:09:48.207 --> 01:09:50.832
You did this for yourself.

01:09:50.832 --> 01:09:52.250
You ruined my life,

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:53.416
for you.

01:10:13.291 --> 01:10:14.791
Molly.

01:10:14.791 --> 01:10:16.416
Hi.

01:10:16.416 --> 01:10:19.541
I know it's late, but I have
a proposition for you.

01:10:21.166 --> 01:10:23.500
(monitors beep steadily)

01:10:32.416 --> 01:10:34.208
I don't think
I want to run my dad's company,

01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:38.000
and I'm not even sure
I want to stay in Seattle.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.541
RYAN: Molly...

01:10:40.541 --> 01:10:42.916
♪♪

01:10:48.125 --> 01:10:50.625
(knocking on door)

01:11:00.333 --> 01:11:01.500
Hi.

01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:05.916
Can I come in?

01:11:07.375 --> 01:11:11.541
I thought about
everything you said to me,

01:11:11.541 --> 01:11:13.791
and I tried to answer for myself
what was true.

01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:18.083
I wanted to make your life
the best it possibly could be--

01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:19.541
-Dad--
-Please...

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:21.458
let me finish.

01:11:22.458 --> 01:11:25.250
But I went about it
the wrong way.

01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:26.375
The thing with Ryan,

01:11:26.375 --> 01:11:29.666
I never should have done that.

01:11:31.083 --> 01:11:35.083
You're entitled to make
your own decisions,

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:38.583
and your own mistakes.

01:11:38.583 --> 01:11:40.916
I took that away from you,

01:11:40.916 --> 01:11:43.000
and I'm sorry.

01:11:45.625 --> 01:11:46.875
But don't resign.

01:11:46.875 --> 01:11:49.541
I don't want you
away from me,

01:11:49.541 --> 01:11:52.708
and I don't want you
angry with me.

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:54.208
You're my daughter,

01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:57.666
I love you.

01:11:57.666 --> 01:12:01.083
So, tell me how to fix this.

01:12:04.333 --> 01:12:06.208
I found something,

01:12:06.208 --> 01:12:08.208
being here.

01:12:08.208 --> 01:12:09.333
It was a piece of me

01:12:09.333 --> 01:12:11.500
I was never going to find
in Seattle,

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:15.750
because I was
away from you.

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:17.166
Okay.

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:18.333
When I came home
that Christmas

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:20.208
I was mourning that

01:12:20.208 --> 01:12:22.833
as well as Ryan.

01:12:22.833 --> 01:12:26.458
You know what else
I figured out, being here?

01:12:26.458 --> 01:12:29.416
I'm really good at
connecting the dots

01:12:29.416 --> 01:12:31.083
to make good things
happen for people.

01:12:31.083 --> 01:12:32.208
So,

01:12:32.208 --> 01:12:34.166
what if I stay
in the company--

01:12:34.166 --> 01:12:35.208
Yes--

01:12:35.208 --> 01:12:36.708
--Not as CEO.

01:12:36.708 --> 01:12:38.708
I want to head up
the Callens Foundation.

01:12:38.708 --> 01:12:41.375
But there is
no Callens Foundation.

01:12:41.375 --> 01:12:42.916
There should be.

01:12:42.916 --> 01:12:44.708
We should be balancing out
the hard business we do

01:12:44.708 --> 01:12:47.125
by reaching out to others,
forming a foundation.

01:12:47.125 --> 01:12:48.041
I want to do that.

01:12:49.333 --> 01:12:51.000
I think I would be
amazing at it,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.291
and it would make my life
feel complete.

01:12:56.041 --> 01:12:57.666
So...

01:12:57.666 --> 01:12:59.125
What do you say?

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.791
(chuckles fondly)

01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:13.916
I look forward to you
coming home.

01:13:13.916 --> 01:13:15.708
I have a couple things
to wrap up first.

01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:17.750
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:20.291
Love you.

01:13:20.291 --> 01:13:21.625
Bye. Love you, too.

01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:23.833
Thanks.

01:13:43.916 --> 01:13:46.083
Charlie's going
to love this.

01:13:46.083 --> 01:13:47.125
Hey.

01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:48.041
There you are.

01:13:48.041 --> 01:13:49.958
This is going to be incredible.
Come on.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:51.916
I'm going to
meet you guys in there.

01:13:51.916 --> 01:13:53.041
Okay.

01:13:53.041 --> 01:13:54.958
Come on, guys.

Charlie has been
moving all morning,

01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:05.416
and this whole time,

01:15:05.416 --> 01:15:07.666
he's been squeezing my hand.

01:15:09.083 --> 01:15:12.041

01:15:14.375 --> 01:15:17.208

01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:19.291
Charlie?

01:15:20.458 --> 01:15:21.708
Charlie, are you there?

01:15:22.958 --> 01:15:25.375
Charlie?

01:15:25.375 --> 01:15:27.041
It's me.

01:15:29.375 --> 01:15:31.125
It's me.

01:15:31.125 --> 01:15:32.541
It's me...

01:15:32.541 --> 01:15:33.541
(weakly) Donna.

01:15:33.541 --> 01:15:34.541
Yes!

01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:35.666
Yes!

01:15:35.666 --> 01:15:36.708
Yes...

01:15:36.708 --> 01:15:38.708
EDNA: I'll
go get Dr. Mats.

01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:40.416
DONNA:
Okay, Charlie,

01:15:40.416 --> 01:15:43.000
you had a car accident,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.375
and...

01:15:44.375 --> 01:15:47.500
And you've been
out of it now

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:50.333
for over a week,

01:15:50.333 --> 01:15:51.541
and all these people,

01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:53.500
they've been helping

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.291
and praying, Charlie,

01:15:55.291 --> 01:15:57.333
for you.

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:00.250
Hi, Charlie,

01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:01.541
I'm Dr. Mats.

01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:03.625
We've been working
together the last week.

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:05.416
Looks like you've got
some fans here.

01:16:05.416 --> 01:16:07.125
(laughter)

01:16:07.125 --> 01:16:07.958
Yeah.

01:16:07.958 --> 01:16:09.125
How you feeling, Charlie?

01:16:10.583 --> 01:16:11.708
Like a kid at Christmas.

01:16:11.708 --> 01:16:12.875
(laughing)

01:16:12.875 --> 01:16:14.458
We've got some
presents for you

01:16:14.458 --> 01:16:16.125
if you want.

01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:17.250
Is that okay?

01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:19.333
DR. MATS: Yeah,
I think it's all right.

01:16:28.541 --> 01:16:30.416
(applauding)
They're all yours.

01:16:30.416 --> 01:16:31.916
They're all books,
Charlie.

01:16:31.916 --> 01:16:33.375
People sent them
to The Bridge

01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:37.041
when they heard
what happened.

01:16:37.041 --> 01:16:39.458
Am I... Am I dreaming?

01:16:39.458 --> 01:16:40.416
(laughter)

01:16:42.041 --> 01:16:44.333
No.

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:46.500
Ryan and Molly,

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.708
and everyone,

01:16:47.708 --> 01:16:49.625
insisted on
bringing them here

01:16:49.625 --> 01:16:52.916
so they'd be here
when you woke up.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.916
And people
sent money, Charlie,

01:16:56.916 --> 01:16:59.666
from everywhere.

01:16:59.666 --> 01:17:03.625
Thousands and
thousands of dollars.

01:17:03.625 --> 01:17:05.333
It's marked urgent.

01:17:05.333 --> 01:17:07.625
What?

01:17:07.625 --> 01:17:09.166
(sighing)

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:12.375
What's this?

01:17:16.416 --> 01:17:19.708
An anonymous source
purchased The Bridge?

01:17:19.708 --> 01:17:21.000
(everyone, alarmed): What?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.291
We still have a week.

01:17:22.291 --> 01:17:23.458
No, wait a minute,
there's a letter.

01:17:23.458 --> 01:17:24.583
"Dear Charlie,

01:17:24.583 --> 01:17:26.166
it came to my attention

01:17:26.166 --> 01:17:28.708
you and The Bridge
have fallen on hard times.

01:17:28.708 --> 01:17:30.416
The time I spent
at The Bridge

01:17:30.416 --> 01:17:32.416
was the best of my life.

01:17:32.416 --> 01:17:34.958
So I bought the building.

01:17:34.958 --> 01:17:36.958
And because
I once saw you

01:17:36.958 --> 01:17:38.625
sell a book
to a single mother

01:17:38.625 --> 01:17:39.833
for a penny,

01:17:39.833 --> 01:17:40.916
from now on,

01:17:40.916 --> 01:17:43.750
and for as long as
you want to run The Bridge,

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:46.833
that will be
your annual lease.

01:17:46.833 --> 01:17:49.083
One penny."

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.625
Oh, Charlie...

01:17:52.625 --> 01:17:54.125
"Because the truth is,

01:17:54.125 --> 01:17:58.416
I would do anything
for you, sir.

01:17:58.416 --> 01:18:00.333
Anything
that was right."

01:18:01.583 --> 01:18:03.958
We don't
have to close.

01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:05.208
We can reopen
The Bridge...

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:09.708
And we have
all the books,

01:18:09.708 --> 01:18:11.458
and the money we need
to repair it.

01:18:11.458 --> 01:18:14.125
Christmas came.

01:18:17.791 --> 01:18:19.125
Your family came.

01:18:22.375 --> 01:18:25.875
You were right.

01:18:25.875 --> 01:18:28.500
God's not done with us yet.

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.875
(chuckling happily)

01:18:41.458 --> 01:18:43.500
♪♪

01:18:56.583 --> 01:18:57.583
Airport.

(quiet sobbing)

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.833
(Molly crying)

01:20:12.833 --> 01:20:15.541
(sniffles)

01:20:15.541 --> 01:20:19.083
(weeping quietly)

01:20:28.125 --> 01:20:30.000
(gently) Molly.

01:20:30.958 --> 01:20:33.458
(gasps)

01:20:33.458 --> 01:20:34.583
(sighs sheepishly)

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:39.291
I couldn't do it.

01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:44.000
I couldn't
get on a plane, and...

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.500
leave Franklin.

01:20:49.583 --> 01:20:52.291
What is it?

01:20:52.291 --> 01:20:54.208
Molly...

01:20:56.041 --> 01:20:57.708
I'm not engaged.

01:20:57.708 --> 01:20:59.875
I was never engaged.

01:20:59.875 --> 01:21:01.208
I lied,

01:21:01.208 --> 01:21:02.750
and I wore my mother's
engagement ring

01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:03.916
because I thought

01:21:03.916 --> 01:21:05.583
you'd be happily
married to Kristen,

01:21:05.583 --> 01:21:08.250
and I-I just couldn't stand...

01:21:09.875 --> 01:21:12.000
I'm sorry for misleading you.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.500
But you're not engaged?

01:21:14.791 --> 01:21:15.708
What about the ring that you--

01:21:15.708 --> 01:21:16.625
I sold it

01:21:16.625 --> 01:21:18.125
to put a down payment
on the building

01:21:18.125 --> 01:21:19.375
for Donna and Charlie.

01:21:21.375 --> 01:21:23.000
That...

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.750
Christmas Eve...

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:26.333
Eve...

01:21:26.333 --> 01:21:28.291
My dad called you,
didn't he?

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:30.958
What did he say?

01:21:30.958 --> 01:21:32.291
He said
a lot of things.

01:21:32.291 --> 01:21:33.958
He played
a recording,

01:21:33.958 --> 01:21:35.250
a conversation
that you had with Preston

01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:37.583
that night we were together.

01:21:37.583 --> 01:21:40.291
You said that you loved him
and were going to Seattle--

01:21:40.291 --> 01:21:42.250
No, no, it's not...

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:44.458
Preston was calling
from my dad's office.

01:21:44.458 --> 01:21:46.541
My dad records
all of his phone calls.

01:21:46.541 --> 01:21:47.458
I...

01:21:47.458 --> 01:21:49.375
I was actually
telling Preston

01:21:49.375 --> 01:21:51.041
that I just love him
as a friend.

01:21:51.041 --> 01:21:52.458
And I guess

01:21:52.458 --> 01:21:54.791
my dad wanted me back
so badly,

01:21:54.791 --> 01:21:56.416
that he cut that part out.

01:21:56.416 --> 01:21:58.750
But you...

01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:00.541
Had those feelings.

01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:04.750
I never stopped
having those feelings.

01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:06.583
But you wanted Kristen.

01:22:06.583 --> 01:22:07.625
You said forever.

01:22:07.625 --> 01:22:08.541
I just did that

01:22:08.541 --> 01:22:09.958
so you could live
the life that you wanted.

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:12.458
The life I wanted is here.

01:22:14.458 --> 01:22:16.125
From the minute I got here
and I met you,

01:22:16.125 --> 01:22:17.750
I never wanted to leave.

01:22:18.958 --> 01:22:20.166
All that time?

01:22:29.708 --> 01:22:31.958
(laughing and crying)

01:22:31.958 --> 01:22:33.125
You meant it?

01:22:33.125 --> 01:22:34.500
You couldn't leave Franklin?

01:22:35.625 --> 01:22:36.708
I quit.

01:22:36.708 --> 01:22:38.250
I'm not
gonna be CEO.

Last night.

01:22:40.125 --> 01:22:43.708
We're forming a foundation
that I'm going to lead,

01:22:43.708 --> 01:22:44.625
using Callens Media.

01:22:45.875 --> 01:22:46.916
What?

01:22:46.916 --> 01:22:48.916
A brand-new foundation

01:22:48.916 --> 01:22:51.250
could be run
from anywhere, right?

01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:53.791
But you're going back
on the road, aren't you?

01:22:55.666 --> 01:22:57.250
Actually, there's...

(chuckles)

01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:00.416
...who reminded me
who I was,

01:23:00.416 --> 01:23:02.333
and who
I wanted to be,

01:23:02.333 --> 01:23:04.000
and I wrote her so many songs,

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.500
that a music executive
signed me to a publishing deal.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.208
He thinks we have enough
for a whole album.

01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:10.375
(stammering in disbelief,
he laughs)

01:23:10.375 --> 01:23:11.416
Ryan!

I'm staying in Franklin,
and I'm gonna write songs.

You're three years early.

01:23:15.708 --> 01:23:17.208
The 10-year plan.

01:23:17.208 --> 01:23:18.875
You wanted to write songs
for a living.

01:23:18.875 --> 01:23:21.458
And you wanted to make
a difference in the world.

01:23:21.458 --> 01:23:23.708
So, we made it three years early
because of you.

01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:26.333

All right, everybody.
