WEBVTT

00:08.942 --> 00:10.811
Hey!
Oh, hey.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.480
Can't believe you
have Shrinky Dinks.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.215
I used to love
to make these.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.650
You draw on the plastic
and you put it in the oven

00:16.684 --> 00:18.519
until it shrinks
into a little--

00:18.552 --> 00:21.155
I don't know what you
call it-- a dink, I guess.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.691
Yeah, I used to love those
things when I was a kid.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.693
Oh, man, it says
"ages three and up."

00:25.726 --> 00:27.528
I don't know if I can wait

00:27.561 --> 00:29.430
two and a half years
to play with these.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.364
So do 'em yourself.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.399
It'll be fun.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.067
I'll do 'em with you.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.535
She's coming over,
she's coming over.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.070
We're Shrinky Dinking.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.105
We're Shrinky
Dinking!

00:37.138 --> 00:39.273
The heck are
you talking about?

00:39.307 --> 00:40.841
Sabrina-- we had
this amazing conversation

00:40.874 --> 00:43.211
about Shrinky Dinks,
and the whole time
I'm thinking,

00:43.244 --> 00:44.512
"I've met my soul mate."

00:44.545 --> 00:46.480
Did you get any chicken?
Wait.

00:46.514 --> 00:47.415
She's coming over here?

00:47.448 --> 00:48.416
What about her boyfriend?

00:48.449 --> 00:49.450
Wyatt? I don't know.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.684
He's away at
college, still.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.186
I don't really know
what this means.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.287
I just know she's coming over.

00:53.321 --> 00:55.256
What's going on with Maw Maw?

00:55.289 --> 00:57.191
She thinks she's in labor.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.526
Oh, my God!

00:58.559 --> 01:01.562
This baby's gonna rip
a hole right through me!

01:01.595 --> 01:03.531
Guys! I'm trying
to beat the record here.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.633
If you're gonna talk loud,
turn your faces away.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.468
The wind is really
messing me up.

01:07.501 --> 01:08.736
MAW MAW:
Oh, my baby!

01:08.769 --> 01:10.871
Okay, you guys have
to get out of here.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.740
I don't want you
to scare her away.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.475
I'm not going anywhere--
I like her.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.644
She's sarcastic
and funny.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.279
She speaks
her mind.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.613
Doesn't she remind you of me?

01:19.647 --> 01:20.881
No. Oh, don't
ever say that again.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.450
You'll ruin it for me.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.452
And if you don't want this
to be the last time

01:24.485 --> 01:26.354
she ever comes over,
you have to get rid of them.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.689
You need to step
way back.

01:28.722 --> 01:29.890
This thing takes
some weird bounces.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.225
Fine.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.261
[pops]
Aw!

01:33.294 --> 01:35.363
Come on, did you really think
I was gonna stand here

01:35.396 --> 01:37.198
and let you break my record?

01:37.231 --> 01:38.766
Thank you.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.269
And I'll take Hope, too--
but you need to take advantage

01:41.302 --> 01:43.404
of this and make
a move on this girl.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.805
Try and get her
to sit next to you
[gasps]

01:44.838 --> 01:46.374
in the center of the couch
where it dips.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.276
Ever since your fat aunt
broke the springs,

01:48.309 --> 01:50.411
two people can't sit there
without ending up in
each other's laps.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.479
Good idea.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.346
Give her some wine,

01:52.380 --> 01:54.515
get her in the couch dip
and kiss her.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.484
She has a boyfriend.
I don't know if I'll be--

01:56.517 --> 01:58.419
Jimmy, if you don't
make a move soon,

01:58.452 --> 02:00.288
you're gonna get stuck
in the friend zone.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.456
And that is a real thing.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.258
I saw it on Friends.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.260
Ross and Rachel
were stuck in it.

02:06.294 --> 02:09.463
It made for some good episodes,
but poor Ross was in hell.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.734
*

02:16.204 --> 02:17.905
* Whoo

02:17.938 --> 02:20.174
* Here we go

02:20.208 --> 02:21.475
* Oh, oh, oh

02:21.509 --> 02:22.476
* Daddy-O

02:22.510 --> 02:24.245
* Oh oh oh

02:24.278 --> 02:25.413
* Birth control

02:25.446 --> 02:27.281
* No no no

02:27.315 --> 02:28.582
* Let it roll
[Hope giggles]

02:28.616 --> 02:30.551
* Oh oh oh

02:30.584 --> 02:32.820
* Whoa

02:32.853 --> 02:33.954
* Whoa

02:33.987 --> 02:36.257
* Whoo

02:36.290 --> 02:37.758
* Here we go

02:37.791 --> 02:39.360
* Oh oh oh

02:39.393 --> 02:42.296
* Oh oh oh

02:42.330 --> 02:44.532
Uh, it says these are supposed
to cook for three minutes,

02:44.565 --> 02:46.434
but this oven only goes
up to 225,

02:46.467 --> 02:48.802
so we may be in
for a bit of a wait.

02:48.836 --> 02:49.770
SABRINA:
That's okay.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.907
[chuckles]
Your house has a lot
of cool stuff in it.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.809
Who plays the piano?

02:55.843 --> 02:58.178
Pretty much anybody who's trying
to get on someone else's nerves.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.283
[laughs]:
Is this you?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.318
[chuckles]: Oh... you don't
want to look through that.
[chuckles]

03:04.352 --> 03:06.254
That's just a bunch of
boring family portraits.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.588
Come on, I love
family photos.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.856
Ah!

03:08.889 --> 03:11.359
Wow, you are, like,
shockingly strong.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.469
How come your mom's the only
one that's happy in all these?

03:21.502 --> 03:23.371
Yeah, well, that's
a little misleading.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.773
Nobody's happy.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.242
My parents would fight
so much on Picture Day

03:28.276 --> 03:30.544
that it always turned into
the worst day of the year.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.346
Just shut up and
put on your beret!

03:32.380 --> 03:34.648
No, I don't want to look
like a dork wearing this!

03:34.682 --> 03:36.517
If you don't want
to look like a dork,

03:36.550 --> 03:38.286
then you need to
take off your face.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.453
[[screams]

03:39.487 --> 03:40.854
Say "cheese."

03:41.789 --> 03:43.424
And the more portraits

03:43.457 --> 03:45.459
that turned out bad,
the more stressed

03:45.493 --> 03:46.960
my mother seemed to get.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.797
If we get there late,
they won't have time

03:49.830 --> 03:53.467
to change the backdrop
from the family before us!

03:53.501 --> 03:55.903
You're killing me, Burt!

03:55.936 --> 03:57.004
[grunts]

03:59.740 --> 04:01.309
Your mother's crazy.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.977
If I ever get that crazy,
I want you to take me out

04:04.011 --> 04:06.380
in the backyard and blow
my head off with a shotgun.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.049
You got that?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.485
BURT:
I just don't understand
why we're wearing ski suits.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.353
We've never been skiing.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.822
I saw a picture in
a house I was cleaning

04:14.855 --> 04:16.590
where the whole
family went skiing.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.959
They were all smiling,
they were on top of a mountain--

04:18.992 --> 04:21.395
looked like a lot of fun.
Of course it looked

04:21.429 --> 04:22.863
like a lot of fun--
they were skiing.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.064
They weren't sitting
in a car

04:24.097 --> 04:25.866
with no air-conditioning
on a 90-degree day

04:25.899 --> 04:26.900
wearing ski suits!

04:26.934 --> 04:29.303
Shut up.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.604
[country music
playing quietly on radio]

04:30.638 --> 04:32.340
Ooh, I like this song.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.607
* Doo, wack-a-doo,
wack-a-doo, wack-a-doo... *

04:33.641 --> 04:34.975
[turns off radio]

04:35.008 --> 04:37.345
I'm not in the mood
for doo, "wack-a-doo."

04:37.378 --> 04:38.912
Well, I am.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.614
* Doo, wack-a-doo,
wack-a-doo, wack-a-doo... *

04:40.648 --> 04:42.583
[turns off radio]

04:42.616 --> 04:45.085
[turns on radio]
Burt, I swear to God, if you
don't turn that thing off...

04:45.118 --> 04:46.820
[engine revs]
Burt,

04:46.854 --> 04:48.589
slow down.
Can't.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.957
My boot's stuck.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.158
What do you mean,
your boot's stuck?

04:51.191 --> 04:53.327
I mean, this stupid, giant boot
you made me wear is stuck.

04:53.361 --> 04:54.462
Can't get it out!

04:54.495 --> 04:57.030
*

04:57.064 --> 04:58.532
We're all gonna die!

04:58.566 --> 05:00.668
You've had a
good life, kid.

05:00.701 --> 05:01.769
[grunting]

05:02.970 --> 05:03.804
[groans]

05:03.837 --> 05:05.806
[tires screech]

05:05.839 --> 05:07.508
* You had a doo, wack-a-doo

05:07.541 --> 05:10.110
* Wack-a-doo, wack-a-doo,
wack-a-doo, wack-a-doo *

05:10.143 --> 05:11.912
* Said oopity-bup.

05:11.945 --> 05:15.683
I could drive if you'd let me
take off these stupid boots!

05:15.716 --> 05:16.817
Shut up!
It's two blocks!

05:16.850 --> 05:17.918
Keep walking!

05:20.854 --> 05:23.824
All right, that's enough
of that.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.126
Uh, you gotta be tired
from being on your
feet all day.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.529
We should sit down.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.800
Sorry, sorry, Hope threw her

05:32.833 --> 05:34.768
pacifier in that coin fountain
at the mall.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.437
Burt made a wish on it,

05:36.470 --> 05:38.406
so he wouldn't let us
take it back out.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.073
Hi!
[chuckles]

05:40.107 --> 05:41.475
How are you?

05:41.509 --> 05:42.543
I'm good.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.044
Did you do your Shrinky things?

05:44.077 --> 05:46.880
Yep, and we were just
about to sit down.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.082
Jimmy was just
telling me about some
of your family portraits.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.486
Really?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.955
I hope he didn't say anything
to make me look too crazy.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.156
Eh.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.926
Doesn't Hope need
her pacifier?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.794
She can suck on Burt's
knuckle for a while.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.496
Come here, honey.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.832
I want to tell you about
a couple of these.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.802
I want to make sure
you see the kind of idiots

06:08.836 --> 06:11.104
I'm dealing with before
you think I'm the crazy one.

06:14.675 --> 06:18.011
Whoa! [chuckles]
This is some couch.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.447
Sure is.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.453
What are you doing
coming in there

06:25.486 --> 06:27.087
and using the dip
before I get a chance?!

06:27.120 --> 06:28.556
You're totally
couch-blocking me.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.624
Jimmy, you could end up
marrying this girl.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.626
I am not gonna let you
paint me out

06:32.660 --> 06:34.695
to be the crazy mother-in-law.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.665
You already made me a stinking
grandmother at 39.

06:37.698 --> 06:41.869
Jimmy, are you missing
a clump of hair in this photo?

06:41.902 --> 06:42.936
Yes, he is.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.138
He ate it.
Excuse me?

06:45.172 --> 06:46.874
Someone stressed me out
so much that I started

06:46.907 --> 06:48.141
pulling out my hair
and eating it

06:48.175 --> 06:49.443
as a nervous twitch.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.479
[chuckles]
You look awful!

06:51.512 --> 06:52.713
Why didn't you just shave
your head?

06:52.746 --> 06:53.814
Oh, God, no!

06:53.847 --> 06:55.616
He's got a birthmark
on his head

06:55.649 --> 06:56.917
that looks like
a big ol'...

06:56.950 --> 06:59.453
Florida.
Shaped like Florida.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.821
Florida with balls.

07:00.854 --> 07:04.157
Hey, how come
your husband's not in this one?

07:04.191 --> 07:07.528
Oh, that's the year
Burt went crazy.

07:10.964 --> 07:14.502
Jimmy! You better
be getting dressed!

07:15.936 --> 07:19.607
Burt, don't you stretch
out that turtleneck.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.542
It's too tight!
I can't swallow.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.210
My mouth keeps filling up
with spit.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.244
I want soup.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.846
You're eating soup.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.748
Jimmy!

07:27.781 --> 07:29.249
I'm here. I'm ready.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.918
I'm sorry.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.053
Oh, no,

07:33.086 --> 07:34.588
not the hair-pulling.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.590
We are not having
another family portrait

07:36.624 --> 07:38.892
where you look like you just
had brain surgery.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.494
It's your fault
for stressing him out.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.995
Just calm down.
Just calm the hell down!

07:42.029 --> 07:43.030
I'm trying!

07:43.063 --> 07:45.132
Just calm down!

07:45.165 --> 07:47.568
Everybody check
each other's teeth.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.737
I don't want to see
any of that creamed
spinach we had last night.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.549
Stop it, Maw Maw.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.016
This is not food.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.218
This tag is digging in
the back of my neck.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.820
Do not pull that tag off.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.789
These outfits cost
a fortune.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.091
And the second we're done here,
they're going right back

08:11.124 --> 08:13.226
to Fashion Barn
Outlet Outlet.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.662
Damn it!

08:16.830 --> 08:18.999
Where's your eyebrow?

08:19.032 --> 08:20.734
I ate it. I'm sorry.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.170
I can't do this
anymore.
Excuse me?

08:23.203 --> 08:25.839
I can't stand here and watch
you torture everyone like this.

08:25.873 --> 08:26.874
Get back here.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.943
Ah-ah! I'll pull it.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.713
You pull that tag off,
we can't make

08:32.746 --> 08:34.147
our next
credit card payment.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.617
That means a finance charge.

08:36.650 --> 08:40.588
You know how I feel
about finance charges.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.222
Let me walk out of here,

08:42.255 --> 08:44.592
and no one has
to pay a finance charge. Ah!

08:44.625 --> 08:45.759
Stay calm.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.696
Fine!

08:48.729 --> 08:50.731
Go! We'll take it without you!

08:50.764 --> 08:53.867
It'll probably be the first
good one we've ever had.

08:55.603 --> 08:57.771
Son of a bitch!

08:59.172 --> 09:01.208
See? It's not me.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.644
It's them.
They're the crazy ones.

09:03.677 --> 09:04.845
Yeah, well, whoever's
fault it is,

09:04.878 --> 09:06.647
it's only once a year
on portrait day.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.816
Every other day,
we're just a normal family.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.317
BURT: Sorry.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.152
Maw Maw needs
new pants.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.621
Her water broke.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.090
I feel its head!
Virginia, you're gonna need

09:17.124 --> 09:19.026
to come back here.
I don't... I don't...

09:19.059 --> 09:20.894
[gasping]
I don't think I can
do this alone.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.597
Your family's amazing.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.866
You actually like this?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.635
I love it! Oh, my God.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.069
And your mother,
she doesn't even realize

09:29.102 --> 09:30.704
that she's the craziest one
of them all.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.072
This is great.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.140
I may never leave.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.275
Why would you?

09:39.980 --> 09:42.015
What kind of cookies
are these?

09:42.049 --> 09:45.285
Don't eat that.
Those are Shrinky Dinks. See?

09:45.318 --> 09:47.755
I made ones that look like
all of us.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.723
And that's Sabrina.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.058
[mutters]
Well, don't worry.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.893
I'll try to keep the loony bin
back there.

09:52.926 --> 09:53.894
Oh, don't worry
about it.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.796
In fact, bring Maw Maw out.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.798
We can let Sabrina cut
the imaginary cord.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.833
Turns out she's a big fan.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.334
Big fan of what?

10:01.368 --> 10:03.203
How crazy we are,
especially you.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.638
So, thanks.

10:04.672 --> 10:05.973
But I'm not crazy.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.040
I already told her that.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.408
Oh, that's what she loves;

10:08.441 --> 10:10.377
that you are, but you don't
realize you are.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.079
But I'm not.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.113
Well, you kinda are.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.882
I'm kinda not.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.784
Okay, look, this is
all great stuff.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.385
Just save it for in there.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.353
Oh, I'll save it for in there,
all right.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.255
She thinks I'm crazy?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.925
Let's see how much crazy
she can handle.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.194
BURT: Virginia! Help!
She's pushing!

10:27.227 --> 10:29.096
Deal with it!

10:33.967 --> 10:37.871
So, I hear you
think I'm crazy.

10:37.905 --> 10:42.142
Yes, I-I said you
were a little crazy,

10:42.175 --> 10:43.911
but in a good way.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.713
You did tell her it
was in a good way, right?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.380
He told me what you said.

10:47.414 --> 10:50.117
Okay, maybe I should go before
we all end up on Dateline.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.819
No, you can't go.

10:51.852 --> 10:52.986
You haven't seen all
the family portraits yet.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.454
JIMMY: She's seen plenty.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.089
Let's do something else.

10:56.123 --> 10:59.727
Checkers?
Got regular, Chinese,

10:59.760 --> 11:01.394
the kind with the horses.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.697
Here it is-- the last picture.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.032
You like crazy?

11:05.065 --> 11:06.834
You're gonna love this.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.704
What's that?

11:10.738 --> 11:13.173
The portrait place is having
a special on Sunday.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.875
I thought we weren't doing
portraits anymore.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.176
Why? Because your father
lost his mind?

11:16.209 --> 11:18.178
We have a new
baby in the house,

11:18.211 --> 11:20.981
and we are getting our family
portrait, with or without him.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.115
Without.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.754
[video game beeping]

11:26.787 --> 11:28.155
Look, Jimmy, I waited too long

11:28.188 --> 11:30.023
to stand up to her
about this portrait thing.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.324
Look at you.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.861
Even the thought of it
turns you into a wreck.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.328
Don't wait until
Hope's eating her hair.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.898
It's disgusting.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.332
Be a better dad than me.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.202
I'm going with a '50s
theme this year.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.104
You can slick
your hair back.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.207
Maybe that'll keep you from
eating it like a mental patient.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.210
Hey, Mom?

11:51.879 --> 11:54.281
Maybe we...

11:54.314 --> 11:56.516
shouldn't do,
uh, the-the picture?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.485
[game beeping]
What?

11:58.518 --> 12:00.754
It's just, it kind of
stresses you out,

12:00.788 --> 12:02.756
which kind of stresses me out,

12:02.790 --> 12:04.958
and, well, uh, there's a reason

12:04.992 --> 12:07.828
why we don't have a picture
with everyone smiling in it...

12:07.861 --> 12:10.030
You told him to do this.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.031
Yup.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.500
The only reason I'm stressed out

12:13.533 --> 12:16.503
is because I'm the one
who has to organize everything.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.105
It's like wrangling
feral cats.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.007
I would be happy
to sit back

12:20.040 --> 12:21.809
and let somebody else
guide the ship,

12:21.842 --> 12:23.343
but it's been 24 years,

12:23.376 --> 12:26.113
and no one else seems
to want to take the damn reins.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.248
Fine. I'll do it.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.316
What?

12:29.349 --> 12:30.851
I'll take the reins

12:30.884 --> 12:33.020
of the... cat ship.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.354
If he's in charge,
I'm back in.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.859
Fine.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.128
Hey, when you took over
the portrait stuff,

12:41.161 --> 12:44.064
you forgot to tell me what
our theme is gonna be.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.298
We've only got three days,

12:45.332 --> 12:46.433
so you might want
to nail that down.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.268
Um, nothing this year.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.502
We're all just gonna wear
whatever we're comfortable in.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.974
Okeydoke.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.409
[cooing]

12:56.443 --> 12:59.847
Hey, I know you
probably know this,

12:59.880 --> 13:02.315
but, uh, we've only got two
days before the portrait,

13:02.349 --> 13:05.218
and I noticed that you haven't
plucked Maw Maw's neck mole yet.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.554
You have to do it early enough
so the redness goes away,

13:07.587 --> 13:09.356
but late enough so it doesn't
start to grow back.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.425
It's a pretty small window
of opportunity.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.161
Yeah, that always
stresses everyone out

13:14.194 --> 13:16.864
with all the yelling and
the holding her down and all.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.966
You're the only one that ever
really notices that hair,

13:18.999 --> 13:21.501
so I think I'm just gonna
let her go au natural this year.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.271
Okeydoke.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.441
Tomorrow's Picture Day.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.443
You got a shower schedule?

13:30.477 --> 13:32.479
We've only got 12 minutes
of warm water.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.547
Yeah. We're not gonna
rush in the morning.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.884
I didn't want everybody
freaking out over being late,

13:36.917 --> 13:39.887
so I figured we'd just get over
there when we got over there.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.889
You know we get
a dishwasher-safe portrait plate

13:41.922 --> 13:43.290
if we get there
before 8:00 a.m.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.492
Yeah, I know,
but since it's kind of creepy

13:45.525 --> 13:47.360
seeing the whole family
staring at you

13:47.394 --> 13:49.429
through a plate of spaghetti,
I figured it didn't matter.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.334
Okeydoke.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.104
Next.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.305
Ready?

13:58.338 --> 13:59.306
Okay.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.242
You know
I said

14:02.275 --> 14:04.377
there wasn't
going to be a
theme, right?

14:04.411 --> 14:06.346
I know. You told us
to dress

14:06.379 --> 14:08.448
in something
we were comfortable in.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.251
This is comfortable.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.591

hard for you.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.859
Next!

14:22.162 --> 14:24.097
Yup.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.234
Oh, my God,

14:27.267 --> 14:29.402
Look at that

like to pose?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.407
Oh, my God.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.976
I think this looks good.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.210
That's easy. Let's do this.

14:38.678 --> 14:39.512
Here we go.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.614

14:42.582 --> 14:44.952
Stop...!

14:44.985 --> 14:47.687
This is crazy.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.957
This picture is going
to be terrible.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.558
Virginia.
Look at you people.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.326
There's no theme.
How is anybody

14:53.360 --> 14:56.229
supposed to know we're a family?
We look like a bunch of idiots

14:56.263 --> 14:58.065
who just met each other
at a thrift store.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.666
We're not even posing.

14:59.699 --> 15:00.667
I mean, come on.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.635
Pick something.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.010
Rappers. Anything.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.511
Damn it, at the very least,

15:11.544 --> 15:14.647
we should be all facing away
from the camera

15:14.681 --> 15:16.683
and look over our shoulders.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.085
Mom, settle down.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.552
It's okay.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.154
It is not okay, Jimmy!

15:21.188 --> 15:22.522
It is not okay!

15:22.555 --> 15:23.623
Because the picture
isn't perfect.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.092
And if the picture
isn't perfect,

15:25.125 --> 15:26.426
there isn't any reason
to take it.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.461
Oh, for God's sake,

15:28.495 --> 15:33.133
am I the only one
who sees that giant tree branch

15:33.166 --> 15:36.669

of the side of Maw Maw's neck?!

No.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.121
Jimmy's paying.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.955
Then we can get out
of here.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.458
I think the one picture

15:58.491 --> 16:00.527
the guy took
could be all right.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.694
Not the worst one
we've ever had.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.601
Why does the picture
have to be perfect?

16:08.635 --> 16:11.071

else's is.

You clean people's pools,
you cut their grass.

You're outside.

these perfect family portraits.

Everyone's happy
and smiling.

16:32.359 --> 16:37.030
I just wanted one
perfect portrait

16:37.064 --> 16:39.632
so I could fool people
into thinking we have

16:39.666 --> 16:41.768
whatever all those
other families have.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.736
But we don't.

Every house has
a good picture?

16:49.676 --> 16:52.112
Yes.

What other nice stuff
they got in there?

want to know.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.665
* I hear tell
you're doing well *

17:45.698 --> 17:49.269
* Good things have come to you

17:49.302 --> 17:51.404
* I wish I had...

17:51.438 --> 17:54.073
[music stops]

17:56.776 --> 17:58.578
[Hope coos]

17:58.611 --> 18:01.814
* I wish I had
your good luck charm *

18:01.848 --> 18:03.550
* And you had a doo-wack-a

18:03.583 --> 18:05.352
* Doo-wack-a, doo-wack-a,
doo-wack-a *

18:05.385 --> 18:07.120
* Doo-wack-a, doo...

18:07.154 --> 18:09.589
* You're going down the street
in your big Cadillac *

18:09.622 --> 18:12.459
* You got girls in the front,
you got girls in the back *

18:12.492 --> 18:14.861
* Yeah, way in the back,
got money in the sack *

18:14.894 --> 18:17.697
* Both hands on the wheel
and your shoulders right back *

18:17.730 --> 18:20.467
* Root, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo *

18:20.500 --> 18:22.669
* I hear tell
you're doing well *

18:22.702 --> 18:25.172
* Good things have come to you

18:25.205 --> 18:27.774
* I wish I had your happiness

18:27.807 --> 18:29.776
* And you had a doo-wack-a

18:29.809 --> 18:31.378
* Doo-wack-a, doo-wack-a,
doo-wack-a *

18:31.411 --> 18:33.313
* Doo-wack-a, doo.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.914
* Doo-wack-a,
doo-wack-a... *

18:34.947 --> 18:36.849
[Maw Maw
scat singing]

18:36.883 --> 18:38.885
[Maw Maw keeps singing]

18:43.690 --> 18:45.625
How about that?

18:45.658 --> 18:47.360
I like it.

18:47.394 --> 18:48.895
Sure you do.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.298
It's another crazy thing
to make fun of our family about.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.699
You want to go
in the other room

18:52.732 --> 18:54.367
and have a look at my
grandmother's inverted nipples?

18:54.401 --> 18:56.203
How about our
bank statement?

18:56.236 --> 18:57.470
That's a hoot.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.872
I think it's a great picture.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.774
I mean, my family has
all those portraits

19:01.808 --> 19:03.910
that you were talking about,
and, you know,

19:03.943 --> 19:06.413
we're all smiling, but
somebody told us when to smile,

19:06.446 --> 19:08.748
so those smiles are fake.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.483
All these smiles are real.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.587
You captured a moment
of actual family joy,

19:14.621 --> 19:16.889
and that's kind of rare.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.394
I think you finally
got your picture.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.200
I like her, Jimmy.

19:27.234 --> 19:30.570
Smart, insightful.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.839
I told you
we had a lot in common.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.241
You're staying for dinner.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.410
We've having TV dinners!

19:37.444 --> 19:38.911
[phone ringing]
If you're a vegetarian,

19:38.945 --> 19:40.980
I'm pretty sure you can
talk Burt into trading you

19:41.013 --> 19:43.216
his vegetable section

19:43.250 --> 19:45.818
for your Salisbury
steak section.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.654
She hit ignore.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.222
What?
She hit ignore.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.523
Her boyfriend just called,
and she hit ignore.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.791
What does that mean?

19:51.824 --> 19:53.293
My phone doesn't have
an ignore.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.894
When I ignore someone,
I just ignore them.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.563
I don't know. I don't
have ignore, either.

19:56.596 --> 19:57.764
But this is
good, right?

19:57.797 --> 20:00.400
Go kiss her.
What?!

20:00.433 --> 20:02.602
Go kiss her. Now.
It's time. I'm telling you.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.405
You need to do it
before it's too late. Go!

20:07.274 --> 20:08.575
Two pounds, three ounces.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.677
Mother is resting comfortably.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.447
Thanks for having me over.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.449
This was really fun.
[chuckles nervously]

20:17.917 --> 20:19.586
[no audible dialogue]

20:21.354 --> 20:23.656
I, uh, I gotta admit
I was a little nervous

20:23.690 --> 20:25.392
about you learning so much
about my family.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.726
I thought it might
scare you off.

20:26.759 --> 20:27.894
Oh, no way.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.028
No, just the opposite.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.898
[both chuckle]

20:31.931 --> 20:34.434
However, if you meet a
girl that you want to date,

20:34.467 --> 20:36.469
you know, like,
not just a friend?

20:36.503 --> 20:38.338
You might want to hold off
on showing her

20:38.371 --> 20:39.839
the family photo album
for a couple months.

20:39.872 --> 20:42.775
Yeah, that might be
a good idea.
Yeah.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.478
Waited too long...

20:45.512 --> 20:47.514
just like Ross.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.550
She's... [grunts]

20:50.583 --> 20:52.619
[both chuckle]

20:52.652 --> 20:56.389
JIMMY:
Maybe I did wait too long.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.858
But I did learn
one thing today:

20:58.891 --> 21:00.493
Sabrina likes me.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.762
Right now it might just be
as a friend,

21:02.795 --> 21:04.697
but who knows?

21:04.731 --> 21:06.966
[Hope cooing]

21:06.999 --> 21:09.436
She was enjoying hanging out
with me enough

21:09.469 --> 21:11.304
to ignore a call
from her boyfriend.

21:11.338 --> 21:14.507
Maybe one day she'll be willing
to ignore him altogether.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.509
[cooing]

21:20.513 --> 21:22.915
Shh...

21:26.018 --> 21:28.388
[Hope crying]

21:28.421 --> 21:30.089
Yep,

21:30.122 --> 21:33.760
I thought that was
a little too easy. All right.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.730
CHILD: Adios, amigos.

21:37.764 --> 21:38.831
Thanks for watchin'.
