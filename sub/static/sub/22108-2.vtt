00:19.365 --> 00:20.664
Two more pages.

00:20.699 --> 00:22.499
Oh, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

00:22.535 --> 00:25.035
One word at a time,
sweetie. Push through.

00:25.070 --> 00:27.538
- I need water. Oh!
- What's going on?

00:27.573 --> 00:29.006
Louise is reading Old Yeller.

00:29.041 --> 00:31.208
I believe it's pronounced "old yellow."

00:31.243 --> 00:32.509
Uh, why?

00:32.545 --> 00:34.077
I mean, I wish I wasn't asking

00:34.113 --> 00:36.346
why one of my kids is
reading a book, but I am.

00:36.382 --> 00:37.714
It's for a school
read-a-thon.

00:37.750 --> 00:39.483
If the entire student
body reads 500 books,

00:39.518 --> 00:41.229
we earn a trip to Wetty,
Set, Go water park.

00:41.253 --> 00:43.053
Oh. Is that place back open?

00:43.088 --> 00:44.366
I thought it was
closed because of the...

00:44.390 --> 00:45.489
The kid who lost a finger?

00:45.524 --> 00:47.024
The diarrhea in the wave pool?

00:47.059 --> 00:48.892
- Fake lifeguards?
- The flesh-eating bacteria?

00:48.928 --> 00:51.094
- Yes, all of those.
- No, it's back open.

00:51.130 --> 00:52.362
Everybody, quiet!

00:52.398 --> 00:54.364
Yeller's got rabies, so a vet's probably

00:54.400 --> 00:56.077
about to come and cure
him, and that'll be that.

00:56.101 --> 00:58.193
- Oh, God.
- I don't think that's what happ...

00:58.218 --> 00:59.736
Ah! Holy crap!

00:59.772 --> 01:01.238
- Yeah, sorry.
- Yeah.

01:01.273 --> 01:03.273
This is why I don't read.

01:03.309 --> 01:04.818
- _
- And by the end, the pigs are

01:04.843 --> 01:06.910
walking on their hind legs,
and callin' all the shots.

01:06.946 --> 01:09.246
The dream of an animal utopia is over.

01:09.382 --> 01:10.382
Count it.

01:11.256 --> 01:13.417
Charlotte totally dies,

01:13.452 --> 01:15.152
and then I used the
book to kill a spider

01:15.187 --> 01:17.020
and that, like, really made me think.

01:17.056 --> 01:19.456
Count it.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.781
Ahh! Someone come quick!

01:24.806 --> 01:27.141
And so, apparently, in
all children's literature,

01:27.166 --> 01:28.632
a really nice animal dies in the end.

01:28.667 --> 01:30.100
And that is not cool, Reading.

01:30.135 --> 01:32.302
- Not cool.
- Yeah, you said it, honey.

01:32.338 --> 01:35.339
Well, put it on the
board, because that's 500.

01:35.374 --> 01:37.107
Wetty, Set, Go, here we come.

01:39.245 --> 01:41.945
Attention! There has been a grisly crime

01:41.981 --> 01:43.213
committed in my office.

01:43.249 --> 01:45.649
My therapy dolls have been mutilated.

01:45.684 --> 01:47.150
Dude, what?

01:48.153 --> 01:50.153
Whoa.

01:50.189 --> 01:53.657
B.O. Theo, Lynn-Secure,
Pierre Pressure...

01:53.692 --> 01:56.393
Some of the others I'll have
to identify from yarn records.

01:56.428 --> 01:58.228
Wasn't ready to see that. Oh, boy.

01:58.264 --> 02:02.399
What sick, twisted, but
really creative kid did this?

02:02.434 --> 02:04.201
For all I know, you did, Louise.

02:04.236 --> 02:05.865
No, no, no. This wasn't me.

02:05.890 --> 02:08.705
This is cray-cray... cray.

02:08.741 --> 02:10.874
- It's three crays.
- What I do know is,

02:10.910 --> 02:13.043
there will be no trip to the water park,

02:13.078 --> 02:15.879
until the fiend who did this
is caught or comes forward.

02:15.915 --> 02:16.932
- No way!
- No!

02:16.956 --> 02:17.849
Come on!

02:17.850 --> 02:19.149
Sorry.

02:19.184 --> 02:20.751
I'm self-medicating with a soothing

02:20.786 --> 02:22.819
Caramel Chamomile from
the new pod coffee machine

02:22.855 --> 02:24.096
in the teachers lounge.

02:24.121 --> 02:26.156
I wondered why you smelled like my aunt.

02:26.191 --> 02:28.258
Yeah, you smell just like his aunt.

02:28.294 --> 02:30.143
Yes, I've heard this before,
I smell like your aunt, yes.

02:30.168 --> 02:31.439
You know what? This whole thing

02:31.463 --> 02:33.263
has kind of a Millie touch.

02:33.299 --> 02:34.831
Remember those homemade "presents"

02:34.867 --> 02:35.999
she put in my locker?

02:36.035 --> 02:38.635
Millie!

02:38.671 --> 02:40.771
Millie is the one student
I know didn't do it.

02:40.806 --> 02:42.172
She's at home this week recovering

02:42.207 --> 02:44.308
from an extensive orthodontia procedure.

02:44.343 --> 02:47.010
Why didn't she wait till
she's in her 40s to get braces?

02:47.046 --> 02:48.612
Like Gwen Stefani.

02:48.647 --> 02:50.948
Can't believe I read for nothing!

02:50.983 --> 02:53.150
I want that water park.

02:53.185 --> 02:54.952
Maybe Mr. Frond will
catch whoever did it.

02:54.987 --> 02:57.487
Him? He couldn't catch
his butt with two hands.

02:57.523 --> 02:58.922
We got to solve this ourselves.

02:58.958 --> 03:00.991
Take some pictures,
gather some evidence...

03:01.026 --> 03:03.493
Put the evidence in little
baggies, label the baggies,

03:03.529 --> 03:05.162
put the baggies in an evidence locker.

03:05.197 --> 03:07.364
But where are we gonna
get little baggies?!

03:08.400 --> 03:09.700
Hey, guys. You know Janine,

03:09.735 --> 03:10.934
from the stationary store?

03:10.970 --> 03:13.270
- Hi.
- Sure. How's it going over there?

03:13.305 --> 03:14.415
Great, right?

03:14.448 --> 03:16.970
People are never gonna
stop buying birthday cards.

03:17.005 --> 03:20.220
- Actually, people have stopped
buying birthday cards. - Oh.

03:20.245 --> 03:22.267
But I still sell a lot
of staples and paperclips.

03:22.292 --> 03:24.615
The Internet can't hold two
pieces of paper together.

03:24.650 --> 03:26.900
- Not yet.
- Janine and I have news.

03:26.925 --> 03:29.252
We're partners. Not romantic partners.

03:29.288 --> 03:30.587
- Right? No.
- Mm-mm.

03:30.623 --> 03:32.089
- No, we are not.
- No, we're not.

03:32.124 --> 03:35.267
Teddy and I are going into the
inspirational poster business.

03:35.292 --> 03:37.103
Oh, I love those posters.

03:37.128 --> 03:39.029
That baby with the
spaghetti on his head.

03:39.064 --> 03:40.493
That got me through my thirties.

03:40.502 --> 03:42.468
Yeah, it's a funny story
how it all came together.

03:42.512 --> 03:45.146
I was up on a ladder
fixing Janine's ceiling fan

03:45.181 --> 03:47.047
and I fell onto a bunch of erasers.

03:47.083 --> 03:49.750
Oh, that's kind of lucky. Soft erasers.

03:49.786 --> 03:50.863
They were on a glass shelf.

03:50.887 --> 03:52.486
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, so that broke.

03:52.522 --> 03:53.882
And under that were X-Acto knives.

03:53.907 --> 03:55.189
- Pointed up.
- Oh.

03:55.224 --> 03:56.769
Still don't know why
you store 'em that way.

03:56.793 --> 03:58.592
- It's a display, it looks better.
- Right.

03:58.628 --> 04:00.694
So I was lying there
bleeding somewhat heavily,

04:00.730 --> 04:02.463
and I said to myself, "Shake it off,

04:02.498 --> 04:04.265
today is tomorrow's yesterday."

04:04.300 --> 04:05.966
And I said, "Hey, Shakespeare,

04:06.002 --> 04:07.768
that would go great on a poster."

04:07.804 --> 04:10.137
Turns out Janine's been
taking pictures for years,

04:10.173 --> 04:12.273
just waiting for the
perfect poster phrase.

04:12.308 --> 04:14.241
- I've got beaches, I've got clouds...
- Yeah.

04:14.277 --> 04:16.577
I've got a monkey holding
a banana like a phone.

04:16.612 --> 04:17.812
Who's he calling?

04:17.846 --> 04:19.680
It's fun to imagine, right?

04:19.714 --> 04:21.081
Eh... Michael Jackson.

04:21.117 --> 04:22.650
We finally settled on a sunrise.

04:22.685 --> 04:24.351
Or maybe it's a sunset, we don't know.

04:24.387 --> 04:26.253
The sun was in my eyes, I couldn't tell.

04:26.289 --> 04:27.588
And I was high.

04:27.623 --> 04:29.957
So we printed up 1,000, and here we are.

04:29.992 --> 04:32.193
- 1,000 sounds like a lot.
- Bob!

04:32.228 --> 04:34.495
- We already sold one.
- Great. To, to who?

04:34.530 --> 04:36.497
Well, to you, right? Don't you want one?

04:36.532 --> 04:38.299
- Of course we want one.
- Uh, uh...

04:38.334 --> 04:39.467
- I want one.
- Yeah, sure.

04:39.502 --> 04:41.164
- We'll take two.
- Wait, why would we want two

04:41.189 --> 04:42.303
of the same poster?

04:42.338 --> 04:44.171
'Cause what if we both
want to look at it?

04:44.223 --> 04:45.090
I want to look at it.

04:45.115 --> 04:47.208
Two coming right up. One, two.

04:47.243 --> 04:48.809
Okay, what do we know?

04:48.845 --> 04:50.211
We know a psycho did this.

04:50.246 --> 04:52.279
We just have to get in
the head of a psycho.

04:52.322 --> 04:54.522
Too bad we're not Millie.
Not that she's psycho,

04:54.550 --> 04:56.350
but she's, you know, psychish.

04:56.385 --> 04:57.351
Tina, that's it!

04:57.386 --> 04:59.220
Wait, we are Millie?

04:59.255 --> 05:00.454
I knew it.

05:00.490 --> 05:04.024
No, she can be our psycho-sultant.

05:04.725 --> 05:07.436
Louise! Is that really you?

05:07.461 --> 05:09.864
Yep. Wait, you know who I am?

05:09.899 --> 05:12.366
I guess I should know my
daughter's best friend.

05:12.401 --> 05:15.536
I only see your face
every time I turn around.

05:18.574 --> 05:20.885
Gosh, I've heard everything about you.

05:20.910 --> 05:24.288
Bob and Linda, the restaurant,
Teddy the handyman...

05:24.313 --> 05:25.412
We're Gene and Tina.

05:25.448 --> 05:27.635
- Sorry, who?
- Um, the siblings.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.048
- Come again?
- Gene and Tina.

05:29.073 --> 05:29.917
No.

05:29.952 --> 05:31.418
Can we go up and see Millie?

05:31.454 --> 05:32.620
Last room on the left.

05:32.655 --> 05:34.421
Don't give her gum or hard candy.

05:34.457 --> 05:36.568
Nothing pointy that she might
use to pry off her headgear.

05:36.592 --> 05:38.092
And don't get too close,

05:38.127 --> 05:39.438
the braces make her spit a little.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.296
Hi, Louise.

05:48.321 --> 05:49.737
Hi, Millie. You're in my room,

05:49.772 --> 05:51.305
you're in my room, you're in my room.

05:51.340 --> 05:53.774
Yeah... Oh, my God.

05:53.809 --> 05:56.744
Hey, Louise, Millie's room
is exactly like your room.

05:56.779 --> 05:58.812
That's definitely cute and not creepy.

05:58.858 --> 06:02.197
Anyway, uh, we just wondered
how you were feeling.

06:02.230 --> 06:04.259
No, how are you feeling, Louise?

06:04.287 --> 06:06.486
Your voice sounds strained.

06:06.511 --> 06:08.165
You've been yelling about
something, I can tell.

06:08.190 --> 06:10.257
- Bad news at school?
- Wow, she's good.

06:11.460 --> 06:12.693
Someone has hard candy.

06:12.736 --> 06:14.436
Gene, give it to her.

06:16.321 --> 06:19.813
Well, Millie, I would like... your help.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.702
Somebody, not you,

06:21.737 --> 06:23.370
but, you know, maybe kind of like you,

06:23.406 --> 06:25.105
chopped up Mr. Frond's therapy dolls

06:25.141 --> 06:26.930
and got the water park trip canceled.

06:26.955 --> 06:30.110
Oh, no. I read Old Yeller for that trip.

06:30.146 --> 06:31.745
- Oh, did you?
- Mm-hmm.

06:31.781 --> 06:33.614
Here are some pictures
of the crime scene.

06:33.649 --> 06:35.394
They're not touch screen,
they're just pictures.

06:35.418 --> 06:37.785
Not that anyone thought
they were... touch screen.

06:37.820 --> 06:40.309
Okay, I've got some ideas,
and I'd be glad to help.

06:40.334 --> 06:41.956
- As a friend.
- Great.

06:41.999 --> 06:44.059
But friends play together, Louise.

06:44.084 --> 06:47.293
I'll help you, in
exchange for play dates.

06:47.318 --> 06:49.263
I scratch your back, you scratch mine.

06:49.298 --> 06:51.285
I really want to scratch
your back, Louise.

06:51.310 --> 06:53.367
No! That's extortion, Millie.

06:53.402 --> 06:54.902
Get out of my room.

06:54.937 --> 06:56.537
It's my room, Louise.

06:56.572 --> 06:58.565
It's my room!

06:58.590 --> 07:00.741
Fine, I'll do it.

07:00.776 --> 07:02.354
Don't leave me alone with her.

07:02.379 --> 07:04.206
Um, what about us, Millie?

07:04.231 --> 07:05.724
There's a trampoline in the back.

07:05.748 --> 07:07.025
Go bounce and stay out of our way,

07:07.049 --> 07:08.515
not-Louise girl,
not-Louise boy.

07:08.551 --> 07:09.661
Scream if you need us, Louise.

07:09.685 --> 07:11.051
No, no, no, no, no, no...

07:11.087 --> 07:14.503
Sorry, toots, we got to go
talk to tramp named O-line.

07:15.495 --> 07:17.299
Gene, I'm kind of worried about...

07:17.324 --> 07:19.283
Louise in there alone with... Millie.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.908
Me, too. I'm also worried about

07:20.943 --> 07:22.409
my testicles banging into each other.

07:22.445 --> 07:23.877
Who am I kidding? I love it.

07:23.913 --> 07:26.180
Okay, it's got to be
someone who hates Mr. Frond.

07:26.215 --> 07:27.414
But that's everyone.

07:27.450 --> 07:29.350
When everyone has a motive,

07:29.385 --> 07:31.352
maybe look for who
doesn't have a motive?

07:31.387 --> 07:32.853
♪ La la la la la. ♪

07:32.888 --> 07:34.788
Yes. Wait, I don't understand.

07:34.824 --> 07:36.123
Enough detective work.

07:36.158 --> 07:37.524
Let's do fun things.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.071
Hey, I know, we'll put on our own play.

07:39.095 --> 07:41.328
You be you, and I'll be you.

07:42.465 --> 07:44.298
And we take a bow and we won a Tony.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.632
Back to the case.

07:45.668 --> 07:48.135
Well, whoever did this
knew Mr. Frond's schedule.

07:48.170 --> 07:50.571
Kind of like how I know yours!

07:50.606 --> 07:53.607
Yes, and someone who knew which
drawer the dolls were kept in.

07:53.642 --> 07:56.143
Like one of the kids
getting counseled, of course!

07:56.178 --> 07:57.077
Let's make a list.

08:17.833 --> 08:19.233
Okay, uh, yes, we sound

08:19.268 --> 08:21.168
amazingly great singing Korean pop.

08:21.203 --> 08:22.469
But we got to focus.

08:22.505 --> 08:24.724
Let's see. All the dolls are messed up,

08:24.749 --> 08:26.640
except this one.

08:26.675 --> 08:28.208
Miss Understood.

08:28.244 --> 08:30.644
Is it because whoever did
this felt misunderstood?

08:30.679 --> 08:32.011
Wow, that's a great question.

08:32.048 --> 08:33.514
Let's dress up my cat.

08:33.549 --> 08:35.082
Oh, my God!

08:35.116 --> 08:36.884
You're staying, Muffin.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.486
Oh, a tramp named O-line.

08:39.522 --> 08:40.687
Now I get it.

08:40.722 --> 08:42.356
Yeah.

08:43.743 --> 08:46.945
Uh, Lin, are-are you sure that's
where we want Teddy's poster?

08:46.970 --> 08:48.028
Why, what's wrong?

08:48.064 --> 08:49.941
Nothing, it's just that
it's kind of in my eye-line.

08:49.965 --> 08:51.765
And it's dumb and I hate it.

08:51.801 --> 08:53.400
That's how inspiring posters work.

08:53.436 --> 08:55.602
You got to see them again
and again until they kick in.

08:55.638 --> 08:57.438
Like taking antibiotics.

08:57.473 --> 08:59.840
Wait, did you put the other
one up over our choking poster?

08:59.875 --> 09:01.141
It was depressing.

09:01.177 --> 09:03.077
Ugh, a picture of that guy gagging.

09:03.112 --> 09:04.445
Right, but someone could choke.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.746
- I mean...
- Bob, relax.

09:05.781 --> 09:07.581
Look at Teddy's poster.

09:07.810 --> 09:10.484
Tomorrow is tomorrow goes tomorrow...

09:10.519 --> 09:11.919
Uh, that's not what it says.

09:11.954 --> 09:14.099
- Today is tomorrow.
- It's not working.

09:14.124 --> 09:16.323
- And breathe...
- I don't like it.

09:16.358 --> 09:18.759
That was the most exhausting
play date of my life.

09:18.794 --> 09:20.427
But we made progress.

09:20.463 --> 09:22.429
We burned some calories
on the trampoline.

09:22.465 --> 09:25.432
And I think the family next door
really started to warm up to us.

09:25.468 --> 09:26.878
Yeah, I watched half of Jurassic Park

09:26.902 --> 09:28.669
through their window.
Every other second.

09:28.704 --> 09:32.339
Well, I guess I got to keep this
going till we crack the case.

09:48.691 --> 09:51.792
Someone obviously hated

09:51.827 --> 09:53.393
Let's talk about Old Yeller.

09:53.429 --> 09:54.744
Forget Old Yeller.

09:54.769 --> 09:56.563
But it was such a great yarn.

09:56.599 --> 09:58.866
Didn't you think it was a good yarn?

09:58.901 --> 10:00.167
Wait, yar, yarn.

10:00.202 --> 10:01.168
There's something about the yarn.

10:01.203 --> 10:02.115
Maybe.

10:02.140 --> 10:03.737
Millie, why do you turn everything

10:03.772 --> 10:04.838
into a freaking...

10:04.874 --> 10:06.406
Wait, I know yarn people.

10:06.442 --> 10:08.842
Tina, Gene, we need to go somewhere.

10:08.878 --> 10:11.178
Okay. The neighbors
shut their blinds anyway.

10:11.213 --> 10:12.746
Rude.

10:14.866 --> 10:16.637
Shoplifters. Harold, wake up.

10:16.662 --> 10:18.000
What? Oh.

10:18.036 --> 10:21.124
Boost your airplane glue
someplace else, you hoods.

10:21.149 --> 10:23.405
And then take it on back to Boys Town.

10:23.430 --> 10:26.241
We're not shoplifters. Wait, what's
Boys Town? It sounds interesting.

10:26.266 --> 10:28.678
Listen, someone cut up this doll.

10:28.713 --> 10:30.246
Do you see anything unusual?

10:30.281 --> 10:33.342
Hmm. This yarn isn't
cut, it's unraveled.

10:33.367 --> 10:34.827
- It's what?
- Unraveled!

10:34.852 --> 10:36.389
- Ah!
- Why not just cut it?

10:36.414 --> 10:37.832
Why were they so careful?

10:37.857 --> 10:40.121
Here's a question.
Why are you still here?

10:40.146 --> 10:42.825
Buy some pipe cleaners
or get the hell out!

10:42.860 --> 10:44.593
Okay. Geez.

10:44.629 --> 10:47.160
We're so close to solving this.

10:47.185 --> 10:50.160
Millie's an odd bird, but she
does have a head for this stuff.

10:50.239 --> 10:52.439
- What's that?
- Oh, it's just a Millie and me

10:52.475 --> 10:54.208
friendship collage I'm working on.

10:54.243 --> 10:55.876
Got to play the game, right?

10:55.912 --> 10:57.341
That's a lot of glitter glue.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.747
Maybe less is more?
Learn to edit yourself?

10:59.782 --> 11:02.449
Seems like Millie's kind of
becoming a real friend, Louise.

11:02.485 --> 11:04.685
She's not a friend,
Tina; we've had some fun.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.854
I mean, not "fun," but
you know... shut up.

11:06.896 --> 11:10.347
I get it. It's like that thing I've
got with Mom. Why put a label on it?

11:10.372 --> 11:14.833
Oh, Mr. Frond. I want to update you
on Operation Waterpark's Back On.

11:14.858 --> 11:16.778
- Um, okay.
- Mr. Frond!

11:16.803 --> 11:19.867
- I'm turning myself in.
- Zeke, you don't have to do this.

11:19.902 --> 11:21.708
You need that field trip, Jimmy Junior.

11:21.733 --> 11:24.705
- Zeke, you did it?
- Yep. Typical me.

11:24.740 --> 11:26.707
I hate those, uh, what
do they call it again?

11:26.742 --> 11:27.841
- I hate it, though.
- Dolls?

11:27.877 --> 11:29.376
- Yeah, dolls.
- Yeah.

11:29.412 --> 11:31.712
So everyone gets to go to
the water park, I guess.

11:31.747 --> 11:33.180
You get to go, Jay-Ju!

11:33.216 --> 11:34.381
You get to go.

11:34.417 --> 11:35.716
Okay, I'm... I-I, I...

11:35.751 --> 11:37.518
Oh, God, I need help!

11:37.553 --> 11:39.453
- Little help!
- Somebody help him!

11:39.488 --> 11:41.021
Come on. He needs help.

11:41.057 --> 11:42.890
So, uh... huh.

11:42.925 --> 11:44.992
That's... case closed?

11:45.027 --> 11:46.493
Hi, Teddy.

11:46.529 --> 11:48.896
- Hi, Janine.
- Just seeing how the poster's doing.

11:48.931 --> 11:51.332
How it's doing? It's dying. Dead.

11:51.367 --> 11:54.301
People seem a little
unfamiliar with the concept.

11:54.337 --> 11:56.203
So what does it do?

11:56.239 --> 11:58.539
- You-you read it.
- And it changes your life.

11:58.574 --> 12:00.124
And where would I put it?

12:00.149 --> 12:02.810
- On a wall?
- I don't really do walls.

12:02.845 --> 12:05.546
I live in a converted
gazebo with my improv group,

12:05.581 --> 12:07.281
- so it's like...
- That's enough out of you.

12:07.316 --> 12:09.049
I don't know what the problem is.

12:09.085 --> 12:11.619
The poster's got everything,
at least, graphically.

12:11.654 --> 12:13.091
"At least graphically"?

12:13.116 --> 12:14.935
Maybe the phrase isn't as
good as I thought it was.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.458
Or maybe your sunrise
is really a sunset,

12:17.493 --> 12:19.615
and it's wrecking the
mood my words create.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.161
I get them confused.

12:21.197 --> 12:22.830
- I already explained that.
- Um...

12:22.865 --> 12:23.942
I liked the chimp with the banana phone.

12:23.966 --> 12:25.130
That was, like, your only good one.

12:25.155 --> 12:26.934
Why did I take a chance on you?

12:26.969 --> 12:28.280
Why did I let you take a chance on me?

12:28.304 --> 12:29.470
Oh, my God, I love it.

12:29.505 --> 12:31.289
Guys. You got a customer.

12:31.314 --> 12:32.539
She's going for her wallet.

12:32.574 --> 12:34.785
Oh, thank God. Sorry about a second ago.

12:34.810 --> 12:36.255
- Oh, me too. You're the best.
- That was crazy.

12:36.279 --> 12:38.078
- No, you are.
- And click.

12:38.114 --> 12:40.114
- What are you doing?
- I'm posting it.

12:40.149 --> 12:41.915
No, stop that. You got to buy it.

12:41.951 --> 12:43.617
It has so many likes. You're welcome.

12:43.653 --> 12:45.519
No, those are our ideas!

12:45.554 --> 12:47.421
Well, I need another poster.

12:47.456 --> 12:49.189
Oh, wait, I forgot my wallet.

12:49.225 --> 12:51.692
So anyway, I guess I don't
need to come over anymore.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.127
Oh, come on, Louise.

12:53.162 --> 12:54.482
You actually think Zeke did it?

12:54.507 --> 12:56.163
Yes. I mean, okay,

12:56.198 --> 12:57.976
he didn't seem to know
what he was confessing to,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.130
but that's a very small detail.

13:00.155 --> 13:02.153
I thought we were looking for the truth.

13:02.186 --> 13:04.489
We were looking for
the water park, Millie.

13:04.514 --> 13:06.098
Have you been to Wetty, Set, Go?

13:06.114 --> 13:07.992
The slides are so fast
you'll get the kind of wedgie

13:08.016 --> 13:10.684
that'll never come out and
you just have to live with it.

13:10.719 --> 13:11.985
But we're almost there.

13:12.020 --> 13:13.853
And I think I know who did it.

13:13.889 --> 13:16.423
Well, if you know who
did it, just tell me.

13:16.458 --> 13:19.426
You've been stretching things
out just to keep me near you.

13:19.461 --> 13:21.005
Ugh! You think it's
all about you, Louise,

13:21.029 --> 13:22.740
just because everything
I do is all about you.

13:22.764 --> 13:25.231
Okay, we're done, Millie. Go
ahead and slam the phone down.

13:25.267 --> 13:27.033
- No, you slam the phone down first.
- No, you.

13:27.069 --> 13:29.327
- No, you! - All right, we'll slam
the phone down together.

13:29.413 --> 13:31.279
One, two, three...

13:31.304 --> 13:32.717
- You didn't slam the phone...
- You didn't slam the phone down!

13:32.741 --> 13:34.719
- Oh! You were gonna slam it down.
- All right, well, slam it down. Ready?

13:34.743 --> 13:36.710
I feel like we should leave the room,

13:36.745 --> 13:38.611
but this is a pretty cute fight.

13:38.647 --> 13:40.213
All right.

13:41.650 --> 13:43.850
After I left Zeke, I
went back to my office

13:43.885 --> 13:45.251
and found Miss Understood...

13:45.287 --> 13:47.454
- like this!
- Ugh.

13:47.489 --> 13:50.256
That means Zeke didn't do it.
He couldn't have done it.

13:50.292 --> 13:52.225
The son of a bitch is still out there.

13:52.260 --> 13:54.194
The water park is off again.

13:54.229 --> 13:56.296
Okay, so it turns out
the case isn't solved.

13:56.331 --> 13:57.764
I will be over at the usual time

13:57.799 --> 13:58.965
and we'll crack this thing.

13:59.001 --> 14:00.001
Hello?

14:00.035 --> 14:02.669
Millie? Millie?

14:02.704 --> 14:04.304
Millie? Millie?

14:04.339 --> 14:06.750
Give it 12 more Millie's
and call it a day.

14:08.009 --> 14:09.726
All right, Millie was a tad upset,

14:09.751 --> 14:11.687
but I can smooth this over.

14:11.712 --> 14:13.679
Oh, Louise. Wow.

14:13.714 --> 14:15.647
Um, I can't believe I'm saying this,

14:15.683 --> 14:17.516
but Millie doesn't want to see you.

14:17.551 --> 14:18.684
Awkward.

14:18.719 --> 14:20.919
But come on, I'm Louise.

14:20.955 --> 14:22.254
I'm the one from the pictures.

14:22.289 --> 14:23.622
I'm just gonna slip in.

14:23.657 --> 14:25.591
Shutting the door now, in your face.

14:25.626 --> 14:27.359
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh.

14:27.394 --> 14:28.861
Well, we're dissolving

14:28.896 --> 14:30.796
the poster business. Janine wants out.

14:30.831 --> 14:32.998
Aw, Teddy, I'm so sorry.

14:33.033 --> 14:34.766
Yeah, well, the pet shop down the street

14:34.802 --> 14:37.336
offered to buy the rest of
the posters at a deep discount.

14:37.371 --> 14:38.815
They're gonna shred them
for hamster cage bedding.

14:38.839 --> 14:40.272
The guy was really impressed

14:40.307 --> 14:42.092
with how much hamster
urine they could absorb.

14:42.117 --> 14:43.041
I can see that.

14:43.077 --> 14:45.644
I'll give you back our posters if
you want, so you can shred them.

14:45.679 --> 14:47.654
- Bob, no.
- But I mean,

14:47.679 --> 14:49.648
if the hamsters just need even one...

14:49.683 --> 14:51.383
No, no, no, those hamsters are fine.

14:51.418 --> 14:52.818
Believe me, I've been down there.

14:52.853 --> 14:55.220
- They've got it pretty good.
- Right. Yep.

14:55.256 --> 14:57.055
I have to get to Millie somehow.

14:57.091 --> 14:59.069
- She says she knows who did it.
- I have an idea, Louise,

14:59.093 --> 15:01.260
and I think you'll jump for it.

15:01.295 --> 15:02.728
Because it's jumping.

15:02.763 --> 15:04.129
Which I could have said first.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.633
Millie, Millie!

15:07.668 --> 15:10.068
Look, I'm sorry. I do want the truth.

15:10.104 --> 15:11.737
And, uh, here's the weird thing -

15:11.772 --> 15:14.406
I was having fun with you.

15:14.441 --> 15:16.469
- There, I said it!
- It's true, Millie.

15:16.494 --> 15:18.906
Louise really worked hard
on that friendship collage.

15:18.931 --> 15:20.212
Hi, this is Tina.

15:20.247 --> 15:23.382
I still think she went kind
of nuts with the glitter glue.

15:23.417 --> 15:26.451
Solid work, but I just question
her taste level sometimes.

15:26.487 --> 15:28.587
Please, we're running out of time.

15:28.622 --> 15:30.923
Wetty, Set, Go never
stays open that long!

15:30.958 --> 15:32.824
Typhus can happen just like that!

15:32.860 --> 15:35.243
All right. Mom, let Louise in!

15:35.268 --> 15:37.001
Yes! I'm gonna come through the window.

15:37.131 --> 15:39.131
Oh, never mind. Bad idea, bad idea.

15:40.579 --> 15:42.539
Bob, you got to pick it
up, we're getting clobbered.

15:42.564 --> 15:44.069
Why are we so slammed?

15:44.104 --> 15:46.572
Jimmy Pesto closed to watch
them blow up that beached whale

15:46.607 --> 15:48.574
in Bog Harbor and we're
getting all his business.

15:48.609 --> 15:50.187
And grill and grill, 
and grill, and grill...

15:50.211 --> 15:51.944
I'm doing the best I can, Lin.

15:51.979 --> 15:53.745
Uh, that's what I'm afraid of. Ha!

15:53.781 --> 15:55.681
Work snap. Said with love.

15:55.716 --> 15:57.382
But come on, seriously, faster, faster.

16:03.959 --> 16:08.310
Today is tomorrow's yesterday.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.154
- I get it now.
- What?

16:10.179 --> 16:11.530
- Lin?
- What?

16:11.565 --> 16:14.233
- I think we're gonna be okay.
- Okay, keep moving.

16:14.268 --> 16:17.035
All I wanted was a friend, Louise.
I'm a simple person.

16:17.071 --> 16:20.272
Sorry, you're just really not, Millie.

16:20.307 --> 16:22.874
Okay, fine, but I'm good
at seeing stuff you don't.

16:22.910 --> 16:25.043
Like clues about who
killed Mr. Frond's dolls,

16:25.079 --> 16:27.613
or why you and I should
be best friends forever.

16:27.648 --> 16:29.715
I know. I get it. But right now,

16:29.750 --> 16:31.883
can you just please tell me who did it?

16:31.919 --> 16:33.619
Let's talk about Old Yeller again.

16:33.654 --> 16:35.053
No, I hate that book.

16:35.089 --> 16:36.421
Remind me what happens at the end?

16:36.457 --> 16:37.889
You know what happened.

16:37.925 --> 16:41.360
Because of the rabies, the boy had
to shoot Yeller, his own dog.

16:41.395 --> 16:42.973
I guess he really didn't like that dog.

16:42.998 --> 16:44.930
What? No. He loved him.

16:44.965 --> 16:46.398
Yeller was his dog.

16:46.433 --> 16:48.033
That's why he had to
be the one to do it.

16:48.068 --> 16:49.901
He loved him so much, he had to be

16:49.937 --> 16:51.803
the one to...

16:51.839 --> 16:52.839
Mm-hmm.

16:53.941 --> 16:55.907
- It was you! 
- What was me?

16:55.943 --> 16:58.343
It was someone who knew
your schedule. That's you.

16:58.379 --> 16:59.990
Someone who knew where
the dolls were kept.

17:00.014 --> 17:01.380
That's you, again.

17:01.415 --> 17:02.881
I loved those dolls.

17:02.916 --> 17:04.449
They were my dolls!

17:04.484 --> 17:06.451
Which is why you
couldn't bear to cut them,

17:06.487 --> 17:08.319
so you unraveled them.

17:08.355 --> 17:09.621
It was done out of love.

17:09.656 --> 17:10.821
Just like Old Yeller.

17:10.858 --> 17:12.290
Old Yellow!

17:12.326 --> 17:15.294
That... that is so farfetched.

17:15.329 --> 17:16.962
That's just so...

17:18.198 --> 17:19.330
Come back!

17:19.366 --> 17:20.577
You didn't finish your sentence.

17:20.601 --> 17:21.833
"That's just so" what? Oh.

17:23.702 --> 17:27.030
He's headed for the teachers' lounge!

17:27.055 --> 17:29.694
You're not faculty.
You can't come in here.

17:29.719 --> 17:30.751
Damn!

17:30.787 --> 17:33.532
Hi, Mr. Branca. Do you have a
key to the teachers' lounge?

17:33.556 --> 17:35.256
No, it cleans itself.

17:36.826 --> 17:38.893
Here you go, everybody in.

17:38.928 --> 17:41.529
Okay, so the word "lounge"
is kind of an exaggeration.

17:41.564 --> 17:43.279
It's more of a waiting room for farts.

17:43.304 --> 17:45.365
We know you did it, Mr. Frond.

17:45.390 --> 17:47.436
What I don't understand is why.

17:47.461 --> 17:49.203
It's his fault.

17:49.238 --> 17:52.273
Hush, you worm.
LaBonz, palm strike his windpipe, now.

17:52.308 --> 17:53.874
I can't believe I'm saying this,

17:53.910 --> 17:56.077
but I think it's too late for violence.

17:56.112 --> 17:58.846
He swore you kids would
never read 500 books.

17:58.881 --> 17:59.829
Of course I did.

17:59.854 --> 18:01.549
- Look at them!
- And then when you did,

18:01.584 --> 18:03.228
we had to stop the water
park from happening.

18:03.252 --> 18:04.685
Why?

18:04.720 --> 18:06.915
Because we already spent
the water park money.

18:06.940 --> 18:08.782
- On what?
- Coffee pods.

18:08.807 --> 18:12.793
The machine was cheap, but the
pods are incredibly expensive.

18:12.829 --> 18:13.922
You monsters!

18:13.947 --> 18:15.657
When the pods blew the budget,

18:15.682 --> 18:17.149
we tapped the water park money.

18:17.174 --> 18:18.501
You could have drunk less coffee.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.163
No, we couldn't have, Tina!

18:20.199 --> 18:22.032
And then we had a problem.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.311
They're getting close to 500 books.

18:23.335 --> 18:24.835
Why did we pick that number?

18:24.870 --> 18:27.637
I didn't even know there were 500 books.

18:27.673 --> 18:30.707
We are in so much crap if that happens.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.843
I'm gonna have a coconut macchiato

18:32.878 --> 18:35.011
and put on my thinking cap.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.547
This isn't coconut!

18:37.583 --> 18:39.212
This is hazelnut!

18:39.237 --> 18:40.884
So it's settled.

18:40.919 --> 18:42.953
You sure we can't just do some graffiti?

18:42.988 --> 18:44.221
Draw a penis on something?

18:44.256 --> 18:46.790
No, it's got to be extreme.

18:46.825 --> 18:49.100
We cut up your dolls and blame a kid.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.038
I'll sharpen the paper cutter.

18:51.063 --> 18:54.197
No. If it has to be done, I'll do it.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.733
They took hours to unravel and arrange.

18:56.758 --> 18:58.301
But I owed it to them.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.437
Well, now that I understand everything,

19:00.472 --> 19:02.784
I'll just pop down to Principal
Spoors' office and let him...

19:02.808 --> 19:04.307
Leave Spoors out of this.

19:04.343 --> 19:05.542
- Palm strike!
- Of course,

19:05.577 --> 19:06.943
if we get to go to the water park,

19:06.979 --> 19:09.181
we may forget about everything.

19:09.206 --> 19:10.781
I'm already starting to forget.

19:10.816 --> 19:11.948
What are we talking about?

19:11.984 --> 19:14.417
I don't even know where I am.

19:14.453 --> 19:17.053
Okay, we'll pay for
the water park, somehow.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.156
Faculty car wash? I have a sponge.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.390
Brag.

19:20.425 --> 19:22.492
Bob, you've been so productive.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.961
Did you organize the dirty
rags under the counter?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.163
Yeah, by smell.

19:26.198 --> 19:27.430
Fancy pants.

19:27.466 --> 19:29.138
And then I did an inventory
in the walk-in, and

19:29.163 --> 19:31.968
- trimmed all my weird eyebrow hairs.
- Wow.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.571
I think it was Teddy's
poster; I-it kicked in.

19:34.606 --> 19:36.484
You soaked up its wisdom,
just like they're gonna soak up

19:36.508 --> 19:37.774
that hamster pee.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.409
Oh, my God. I hope it's not too late.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.478
Me, too. What are we talking about?

19:41.513 --> 19:44.247
Oh, yeah, these are gonna shred up nice.

19:44.283 --> 19:45.949
- Thanks.
- Teddy, Janine, wait.

19:45.984 --> 19:48.018
I was inspired, by your poster.

19:48.053 --> 19:50.149
I mean, not a lot, but somewhat.

19:50.174 --> 19:52.622
And I had a very
productive day yesterday.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.691
It's true. It was like Cocoon.

19:54.726 --> 19:57.194
I'm just saying, maybe you
shouldn't give up so quickly.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.329
I don't know, Bob. It's
been really discouraging.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.664
But Janine,

20:00.699 --> 20:02.099
what would the poster tell us to do?

20:02.134 --> 20:03.200
Um...

20:03.235 --> 20:04.367
What would it say, Janine?

20:04.403 --> 20:05.468
"Hang in there"?

20:05.504 --> 20:06.636
No, that's another poster.

20:06.672 --> 20:07.637
"Keep on truckin'"?

20:07.673 --> 20:09.005
Another poster, but...

20:09.041 --> 20:11.107
It would say "Try again," maybe?

20:11.143 --> 20:12.008
There she is.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.443
You up for this, partner?

20:13.478 --> 20:15.445
Still not romantic partners, I assume?

20:15.480 --> 20:17.047
- No.
- I'm in anyway. People change.

20:17.082 --> 20:19.182
Hey, I've got an idea for a poster.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.151
It's a hamster on a wheel and it says,

20:21.186 --> 20:22.719
"I'm wheely excited."

20:22.754 --> 20:24.154
- I love it.
- Get out.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.224
Well, we made it.

20:27.259 --> 20:30.227
We're Wetty, we're Setty
and we are about to Go.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.729
Here's hoping none of us
swallow Band-Aids today.

20:32.764 --> 20:34.464
Jimmy Junior, wait up. Zeke,

20:34.489 --> 20:36.010
what's the diarrhea
sitch in the wave pool?

20:36.034 --> 20:37.534
It ain't exactly Evian,

20:37.569 --> 20:40.036
- but it's not wavy gravy, either.
- Good enough.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.505
Well, Millie, that's a
nice swimsuit we're wearing.

20:42.541 --> 20:43.541
We look good.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.208
Thank you, Louise. As do we.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.677
You want to go watch the
wedgies down at the big slide?

20:47.713 --> 20:49.357
And after that we could
just move in together.

20:49.381 --> 20:50.381
Easy, easy.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.681
Okay, a hundred sleepovers.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.049
I'll squeeze you in for a lunch.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.185
- I get to chew your food.
- Millie.
