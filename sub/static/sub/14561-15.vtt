WEBVTT

00:14.515 --> 00:18.686
This is the former home
of the Los Angeles Ledger.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.388
In 1985,

00:20.421 --> 00:22.523
it became a house of horrors
for three friends,

00:22.556 --> 00:24.492
each molested by this man:

00:24.525 --> 00:26.827
Arnold Winslow,

00:26.860 --> 00:28.229
a teacher from the children's
elementary school.

00:28.262 --> 00:31.465
Winslow lured them on separate
occasions and raped them,

00:31.499 --> 00:34.735
threatening to kill the boys
if they divulged the truth.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.437
FBI agents arrested Winslow,

00:36.470 --> 00:39.740
but not before he left
an indelible mark.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.342
25 years later,

00:41.375 --> 00:44.512
Sean Westmark, Devin Shepard
and Matt Burrows

00:44.545 --> 00:46.347
each carry very different scars.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.349
Sean turned adversity
into success,

00:48.382 --> 00:50.751
becoming one of the most
successful litigation
attorneys

00:50.784 --> 00:52.052
in the history of California

00:52.086 --> 00:55.456
and a likely candidate
for the next mayoral election.

00:55.489 --> 00:59.160
Devin turned misfortune
into fortune, literally,

00:59.193 --> 01:01.562
because he is currently the
author of a bestselling book

01:01.595 --> 01:05.633
on personal healing
and coping with crises.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.802
Fate would not be kind
for Matt Burrows.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.172
After years of battling
drugs and depression,

01:11.205 --> 01:12.606
he committed suicide.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.542
Family and friends
say in recent weeks,

01:14.575 --> 01:16.377
he appeared more
troubled than normal.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.645
I would agree.

01:17.678 --> 01:21.215
Because, you see, Matt Burrows
isn't just part of this story.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.184
He's my brother.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.731
Okay. Rise and shine.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.467
There you go.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.868
Is it already 8:00?

01:40.901 --> 01:42.102
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

01:42.136 --> 01:45.406
You know, you might want to find
a new use for Occam's razor.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.808
In ancient India, beards
were held in such reverence,

01:47.841 --> 01:50.478
they could be cut off
and used as a form of payment.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.346
That's all right.
You can stay for free.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.348
Actually, do you have a pair
of scissors? -(knock on door)

01:54.382 --> 01:55.549
Larry Fleinhardt?

01:55.583 --> 01:57.351
Uh, yes. That would be me.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.520
Bring it in, boys!
-Boys?!

01:59.553 --> 02:02.490
Ah, my notebooks have arrived.

02:03.824 --> 02:04.825
It'll be fine right there.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.227
I had a lot

02:06.260 --> 02:08.696
of free time in the desert.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.364
Hey.

02:10.398 --> 02:11.599
How you doing?
Uh, headquarters called.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.301
Seems we've been
a little bit lax

02:13.334 --> 02:14.602
about our in service records.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.836
Yeah? By "we," you mean...?

02:15.869 --> 02:17.571
You.
-Uh-huh, and by "lax"...?

02:17.605 --> 02:19.440
Two years behind
every other office. -Mm-hmm.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.809
Colby has to do
a five-year financial check,

02:21.842 --> 02:24.445
and Charlie has
to have a polygraph test.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.414
(chuckles):
Oh. Good luck with that.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.549
It's a test, man.
He's a genius, right?

02:28.582 --> 02:30.218
Hey, Granger.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.585
Bud, how about some help, man?

02:31.619 --> 02:32.753
Ooh.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.588
That looks like
supervisor stuff to me.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.391
Don, Mary Paulson the reporter

02:37.425 --> 02:38.459
wants some face time.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.628
She's doing a retrospective
on a kidnapping case

02:40.661 --> 02:42.196
the FBI solved back in '85.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.697
The case agent's dead,

02:43.731 --> 02:45.433
so HQ requested
you take the interview.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.201
Oh, that's all yours, boss man.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.669
Man...

02:48.702 --> 02:50.738
Hey, Colby, how about
you take that one, man?

02:50.771 --> 02:52.706
No way.
-Actually, that's an order.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.575
Take Nikki. Flip for it.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.909
There you go.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.546
(siren wailing in distance)

02:58.579 --> 03:00.581
Tails. You lose again.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.384
How is it 50-50
if you win every time?

03:03.417 --> 03:04.652
Hey, take it up with Charlie.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.587
You look good on camera.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.556
Plus, you, uh,
you don't need any makeup.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.224
You can just keep on
what you have.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.659
PAULSON:
...make a great shot, yeah.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.761
Oh, hi. Mary Paulson.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.229
Pleasure to meet you.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.298
Agent Granger
and Agent Betancourt.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.766
Yeah, here, roll on this, yeah.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.469
We've arranged for
Sean Westmark and Devin Shepard

03:21.502 --> 03:23.504
to meet for the first time
in nearly a decade.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.972
Devin.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.507
Sean, how are you?
-How you been?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.376
Pretty good. Yourself?
-(gunfire)

03:28.409 --> 03:29.377
Everybody down!

03:29.410 --> 03:30.378
Get down!

03:30.411 --> 03:31.812
Come here behind the car.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.214
(gunfire continues)

03:38.286 --> 03:40.388
Okay, 10:00. Cover me.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.490
(gunfire continues)

03:49.297 --> 03:51.532
-You okay?
-Yeah. Check him.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.633
Stay down.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.605
Stay down!

03:59.540 --> 04:01.509
Is he going to be okay?

04:01.542 --> 04:02.543
He's dead.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.012
(gunfire continues)

04:16.457 --> 04:17.958
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:17.991 --> 04:20.861
Got no shell casings,
no footprints.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.331
This guy either watches
a lot of the History Channel

04:23.364 --> 04:24.765
or we're dealing with a pro.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.834
Well, he took out Shepard
with the first shot,

04:26.867 --> 04:28.436
so we got to assume that
that was his target.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.603
On the other hand,
he kept firing.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.838
Could be you got

04:30.871 --> 04:34.808
to Sean Westmark before he had
a chance to finish the job.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.977
Did you know Shepard
sold close to a million books

04:37.010 --> 04:38.011
over the last three years?

04:38.045 --> 04:39.780
How to Get the Most
Out of You:

04:39.813 --> 04:41.449
Synergize Every Day.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.750
I mean, what the hell
does that even mean?

04:42.783 --> 04:44.452
I have no idea.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.720
Hey, you know, actually, I've
been meaning to talk to you

04:46.754 --> 04:48.422
about your, uh,
your financial update.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.591
There's a series
of overseas transactions

04:50.624 --> 04:52.460
I want to just, you know...
-Sure, sure.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.428
Yep, no problem.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.996
Hey, buddy,
ERT needs me downstairs.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.798
Hey, Granger,
your phone didn't even beep.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.467
All right, I'll call Amex.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.870
You know, I'd hate to lose
those rewards points.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.705
AMITA:
This is incredible.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.707
Well, you got to give credit to

05:06.740 --> 05:09.042
a pollution-free
desert sky for that.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.879
Hey. For as long as you guys
have known me,

05:11.912 --> 05:12.713
what has been my fantasy?

05:12.746 --> 05:14.915
You want me
to talk about that here?

05:14.948 --> 05:16.817
I meant academically.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.386
To teach at Cambridge.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.788
No.
-Yeah.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.722
No.
-Yes.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.858
"On behalf of the
University of Cambridge,

05:24.892 --> 05:26.927
"it gives me great pleasure
to invite you to join

05:26.960 --> 05:29.763
"our faculty
as a visiting professor

05:29.797 --> 05:31.865
for the upcoming term."
That's incredible, Charlie!

05:31.899 --> 05:33.401
It's incredible!

05:33.434 --> 05:35.035
Hey, congratulations, Charles.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.037
Thank you.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.772
I thought they were
considering you for 2012.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.774
They were, but then a slot
opened up unexpectedly.

05:40.808 --> 05:43.010
And the best part:
they have room

05:43.043 --> 05:44.945
in their budget
for two visiting professors.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.814
I'm highly flattered,
but I just got back...

05:46.847 --> 05:48.081
I meant Amita.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.983
We're going to England!
-Going to England.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.819
(both chuckle)

05:51.852 --> 05:54.788
Do you two realize you will be
walking the same halls

05:54.822 --> 05:56.490
as Francis Bacon,

05:56.524 --> 05:59.627
Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin?

05:59.660 --> 06:01.595
We can rent a cottage
in the countryside,

06:01.629 --> 06:03.163
eat strawberries and cream
at Wimbledon.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.899
We have to leave
before the summer?

06:05.933 --> 06:07.401
I know. We're gonna have
to push back

06:07.435 --> 06:08.569
the wedding date,
but how often does

06:08.602 --> 06:09.903
an opportunity
like this come up?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.507
(gunshots, glass shattering
over video)

06:13.541 --> 06:16.844
Here's where
the cameraman gets shot.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.946
See there?
That's our shooter.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.582
Well, I just spoke
to the hospital.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.016
Leo's going to pull through.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.552
That's one tough cameraman
you got there.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.753
Any luck?

06:25.786 --> 06:28.422
We got a guy who might be able
to do something with this.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.590
What is he, a magician?

06:29.623 --> 06:30.424
He's been known to pull

06:30.458 --> 06:31.759
an occasional rabbit
out of his hat.

06:31.792 --> 06:32.826
No offense,

06:32.860 --> 06:34.862
but I did read
The 9/11 Commission Report.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.797
That DVD goes somewhere,
so do I.

06:39.867 --> 06:40.834
(knocks)

06:42.970 --> 06:44.938
Oh, Ms. Paulson.
(chuckles)

06:44.972 --> 06:46.674
Uh, they didn't tell me
you were coming.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.576
I've actually been
a fan of yours

06:48.609 --> 06:50.578
since you were
the anchor at Channel 10.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.580
Thank you.
-Here's the footage.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.981
Okay, great.
Please take a seat.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.083
You think you can work
some of your scientific voodoo

06:56.116 --> 06:57.618
and pull an image
of the shooter?

06:57.651 --> 07:00.153
If by "voodoo" you mean
point-pattern matching

07:00.187 --> 07:01.589
and line detection, yes.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.691
(whispers):
Ask him what he's talking about.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.793
What are you talking about?

07:07.561 --> 07:10.063
Um, well,
imagine a team of scientists

07:10.097 --> 07:12.500
trying to sequence
a strand of DNA

07:12.533 --> 07:13.867
from a piece of bacteria.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.169
There are billions
of possible combinations.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.972
The sample of DNA is loaded
into a sequencer,

07:19.006 --> 07:21.842
which sorts through
the combinations of nucleotides,

07:21.875 --> 07:23.711
picking only the pieces
or molecules

07:23.744 --> 07:24.912
that have relevant information,

07:24.945 --> 07:28.148
until the helices are all
assembled in the correct order.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.883
Now, what you have here
is no different,

07:29.917 --> 07:32.953
because each second of video
is actually made up

07:32.986 --> 07:35.055
of 30 individual frames.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.925
Multiplied by three minutes,
that's 5,400 frames.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.627
Now, you factor in
security cameras

07:39.660 --> 07:42.229
from surrounding buildings,
DOT footage,

07:42.262 --> 07:45.032
you're talking about thousands
and thousands of frames.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.100
So, like the DNA machine,

07:47.134 --> 07:49.737
your math looks for
individual frames

07:49.770 --> 07:52.506
that have images-- partial
or whole-- of the shooter

07:52.540 --> 07:56.143
and sorts the bits and pieces
into a linear sequence?

07:56.176 --> 07:58.679
My star pupil.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.080
(Nikki giggles)

08:00.113 --> 08:02.716
Hey, FYI, Teach,
David's looking for you.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.852
Something about a polygraph.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.019
(sighs)

08:06.053 --> 08:08.021
You happen to tutor
for that exam?

08:09.757 --> 08:10.924
MAN:
Mike Nash.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.926
-Sean's chief of staff.
-Uh, hey, Don Eppes.

08:12.960 --> 08:13.994
-This is David Sinclair.
-Why don't you guys

08:14.027 --> 08:15.128
go ahead and take a seat.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.765
Thanks. That's you, huh?

08:17.798 --> 08:19.032
Yep.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.268
Sean and I were throwing

08:21.301 --> 08:24.071
snowballs since we were five,
footballs at ten.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.274
By the time we were 23,
we traded it all in for bullets.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.910
Not a memory most people
would keep around.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.945
You don't know Sean.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.682
See, that reminds him to fight
the good fight every day.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.617
He stood up to that bastard.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.251
Walked into that courtroom--
he was fearless.

08:38.285 --> 08:41.655
Pointed his finger at Winslow--
he put him behind bars.

08:41.689 --> 08:44.191
Ignore him. He sometimes acts
more like my publicist

08:44.224 --> 08:45.993
than my chief of staff.
Sean Westmark.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.761
Don Eppes.
-David Sinclair. -Pleasure.

08:47.795 --> 08:48.996
Sit, please.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.099
Cannot imagine who
would want to kill Devin.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.101
It's possible you were
the intended target.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.137
You know, you... you have made
some enemies.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.706
Tobacco giants
and pharmaceutical companies

08:58.739 --> 09:00.608
don't hire hit men,
they hire lawyers.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.010
Any idea who might
want to hurt you guys?

09:03.043 --> 09:06.079
Winslow-- but he died in 1991.

09:06.113 --> 09:10.083
LAPD found his wallet
smeared with blood,

09:10.117 --> 09:11.619
but, uh, they never
recovered a body.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.688
Your dad was brought in
for questioning.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.156
It's 'cause he was in
the Marine Corps.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.692
He was back East on business
when Winslow went missing.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.928
What, you guys think that
his father shot Devin?

09:20.961 --> 09:24.031
Uh, forgive me, gentlemen,
but the L.A. Times is waiting.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.034
Anything else we can do,
please call, okay?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.769
Sure.
-Absolutely anything.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.103
You got it.

09:38.646 --> 09:41.148
AMITA:
Guess who?

09:41.181 --> 09:43.784
Larry, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.018
We don't have to wait

09:45.052 --> 09:46.954
until we're back from England
to get married.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.288
Oh, yeah?
-Yep.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.990
I hold in my hands

09:50.023 --> 09:53.260
Barcelona, Lake Como,
the Amalfi Coast and Paris.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.062
All the most romantic
cities in the world,

09:55.095 --> 09:56.396
all within a few hours

09:56.429 --> 09:59.366
train ride of Cambridge,
all suitable for a wedding.

09:59.399 --> 10:02.035
Sounds interesting.

10:02.069 --> 10:05.005
You don't seem excited.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.775
No, I totally... I'm excited.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.877
I just got this case

10:09.910 --> 10:12.112
and this polygraph test
to look forward to.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.114
But you like the idea?
-I love the idea.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.950
We're going to put together
a decision tree,

10:16.984 --> 10:18.786
and that'll help us
pick the best city. -(beep)

10:18.819 --> 10:20.120
Okay.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.388
I think you need to call Nikki.

10:21.421 --> 10:24.157
I don't think
she's ever been to Europe.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.158
I mean, we can ask her.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.760
No, about the case.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.362
I think you just discovered
who killed Devin Shepard.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.170
Charlie just sent this over.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.973
Hmm. Looks like a filmstrip.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.142
This is, uh,
point-pattern matching

10:42.175 --> 10:44.077
or edge detection--
something like that.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.851
Gotcha.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.053
Oh, that's Mike Nash.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.422
PAULSON:
There he is.

10:55.455 --> 10:58.125
Remember, you can film,
but you can't interfere.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.126
(siren whoops)

11:04.064 --> 11:05.733
Hold on.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.170
(tires screech)

11:11.271 --> 11:12.906
What, do you guys practice that?

11:12.940 --> 11:14.775
Nah, that's just
the way he drives.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.343
Let's go, give me your hands.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.387
Look, I'm not saying crap,

11:27.420 --> 11:29.456
except I want to see a doctor.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.024
Well, you've known Devin Shepard

11:31.058 --> 11:33.160
since, what'd you tell me,
you were five years old?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.095
A .30 caliber round
through the heart.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.230
Ooh, is that what
you do to your friends?

11:37.264 --> 11:40.433
Friends understand loyalty.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.035
Let me ask you something.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.004
You know what it means
to keep a promise?

11:44.037 --> 11:46.073
Devin made money based on
what happened to us.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.776
Us?

11:50.878 --> 11:53.180
Yeah, us.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.316
My father was a real evil
son of a bitch.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.986
And if he knew
that his son was...

12:00.854 --> 12:02.790
I'd have been disowned.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.291
But Sean-- he protected me.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.059
He kept me out of it.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.194
But it sounds like

12:07.227 --> 12:09.963
Devin did, too, Mike,
so I don't really understand.

12:09.997 --> 12:13.000
He sold a movie
based on our nightmare.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.334
A movie.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.037
So somebody needed to man up

12:17.070 --> 12:19.272
and end it.

12:19.306 --> 12:23.043
Well, sniper shot
at 150 yards away.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.945
Yeah, that's real manly.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.054
I spent a month in Africa

12:34.087 --> 12:36.857
doing a documentary on children
who worked in the diamond mines.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.459
I never thought
I'd be shocked again.

12:39.492 --> 12:43.230
First day here, I learned
there are no routine cases.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.233
All these years,
my brother kept Mike's secret,

12:46.266 --> 12:47.868
even from me.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.469
He sounds like an honorable guy.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.239
That's what bothers me
about his suicide.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.207
He had his problems.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.210
Matt...

12:57.244 --> 12:58.946
he valued life.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.815
You think maybe
he didn't kill himself?

13:03.917 --> 13:07.955
He was nervous, paranoid
the week before he hung himself.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.123
I don't exactly

13:10.157 --> 13:12.459
sound like an investigative
reporter, do I?

13:12.492 --> 13:13.961
Hey, you sound like a sister.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.362
Let me check the reports
for you.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.298
Excuse me. Where is he?

13:18.331 --> 13:20.200
He's in the interrogation room.
-You've been talking to him?

13:20.233 --> 13:21.969
What happened to Miranda?

13:22.002 --> 13:23.303
He waived his rights.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.972
He shot Devin Shepard.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.274
(sighs)
Listen...

13:27.307 --> 13:29.977
Mike and I...

13:30.010 --> 13:32.179
No matter what,
he's still entitled to a lawyer.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.147
Thank you.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.888
(phones ringing)

13:40.921 --> 13:42.022
Hey.

13:42.055 --> 13:45.025
Larry, what a surprise.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.393
No, you...
Didn't you say stop by?

13:46.426 --> 13:48.595
I didn't exactly mean today.
(chuckles)

13:48.628 --> 13:50.430
Oh. -But wait a minute,
now that you're here,

13:50.463 --> 13:51.298
let's-let's have lunch.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.632
KATH: Alan, how are the
software updates

13:52.665 --> 13:53.466
for transportation

13:53.500 --> 13:55.869
and zoning analysis
coming along?

13:55.903 --> 13:57.537
Uh, we got initial data
from our beta test sites.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.606
I'll have more results
later this afternoon.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.208
Larry Fleinhardt.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.210
"From Classroom to Cosmos."

14:03.243 --> 14:05.312
You're the Rocket Man.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.948
Listen, that's a title bestowed
upon me by the blogosphere.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.082
Tell me about liftoff.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.919
All the thrust and energy
must be really something.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.220
The rocket booster
exploding with fuel.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.956
Well, actually there's three.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.525
There's a dark orange tank
we call "E.T.,"

14:18.558 --> 14:20.193
there's two white SRBs.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.029
I could draw a picture.
-I want you.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.197
I beg your pardon?
-Working with us.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.033
I want you.
-Oh, no.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.235
No, I'm flattered, no.
-Oh, excuse me.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.469
I don't...
-I-I've got to run.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.504
Yeah, I don't have time...

14:31.538 --> 14:33.140
Gosh.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.341
She is something, right?
-You know, she's

14:34.374 --> 14:38.145
reminiscent of the asteroid
Hermes, creating a sensation

14:38.178 --> 14:40.280
as it passes less than a million
kilometers from the Earth,

14:40.313 --> 14:41.915
before just disappearing again.

14:41.949 --> 14:45.252
Yeah, I know exactly
what you're talking about.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.554
(beeping)

14:47.587 --> 14:49.389
You know,
I think I may be allergic

14:49.422 --> 14:51.391
to this rubber here,
'cause I'm terribly itchy.

14:51.424 --> 14:55.262
And I did some
chest presses yesterday,

14:55.295 --> 14:57.364
-and this thing is
pressing against me... -Charlie.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.966
I'm very sore.
It's terribly uncomfortable.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.300
Just calm down, Charlie, okay?

15:00.333 --> 15:02.335
Everybody with your level
of security clearance

15:02.369 --> 15:04.437
-has to take a polygraph test.
-I know.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.373
It's just my...
my breasts are sore.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.141
All right.
I'm just gonna ask you

15:08.175 --> 15:10.210
a few routine questions,
all right?

15:10.243 --> 15:11.979
Okay.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.714
So, is your name Charlie Eppes?

15:14.747 --> 15:18.385
Well... well, technically,
it's Charles Eppes.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.653
My parents wanted to name me
Isaac when I was born,

15:20.687 --> 15:22.389
which would've been disastrous.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.225
My Hebrew name
would've been Yitzhak.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.394
Okay, just, uh, if you can
answer "yes" or "no."

15:27.427 --> 15:29.096
-Right, yes.
-All right.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.663
See, that was easy.

15:30.697 --> 15:34.334
Have you ever stolen anything
over $500 in your life?

15:34.367 --> 15:38.405
I stole a 1981 Reggie Jackson
Topps baseball card.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.374
I don't think
that's worth $500, right?

15:41.408 --> 15:42.742
Mark Carroll and I were

15:42.775 --> 15:44.711
flipping cards
during lunch one day,

15:44.744 --> 15:46.713
and the wind blew
his Reggie Jackson away.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.416
So, I put together
a modified K index,

15:49.449 --> 15:52.119
and I tracked the card's path.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.453
I found it,

15:53.486 --> 15:56.356
but he left for camp the
next day, so I just took it.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.357
Next question.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.659
All right, so...

15:59.692 --> 16:02.295
Have you, uh, ever committed
a violent crime?

16:02.329 --> 16:05.232
(machine beeping rapidly)

16:09.036 --> 16:13.640
Uh... I'm a murderer.

16:13.673 --> 16:17.477
I was six, which would make
Don ten at the time, and he

16:17.510 --> 16:21.681
brought the class gerbil home
for Christmas break.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.684
It was so cute,
and I was playing with him

16:24.717 --> 16:27.520
while I was conducting
an experiment one day, and...

16:27.554 --> 16:30.090
who knew that gerbil fur
was so flammable?

16:30.123 --> 16:31.458
You understand what I'm asking?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.493
I'm asking have you ever
committed a violent crime?

16:33.526 --> 16:34.627
Just "yes" or "no."

16:34.661 --> 16:36.463
I left the cage door open,

16:36.496 --> 16:38.565
and I just told Don
that he ran away, but...

16:39.666 --> 16:42.069
I'm a heinous monster.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.471
This machine
has a power over me.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.139
I really need to take a break.
-Absolutely.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.474
Take five minutes.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.542
Water, some yoga,
maybe just relax.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.748
I got the ERT results
on Matt Burrows' death.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.484
There were
two fresh samples of DNA

16:57.517 --> 16:59.752
found on the rope
that he used to hang himself.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.488
One was his, and one wasn't.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.291
So there was someone else
in the room with him, huh?

17:04.324 --> 17:06.159
His sister's got good instincts.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.696
I knew Matt
wouldn't kill himself.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.399
This second set of DNA
proves he was murdered.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.501
All it confirms
is that another individual

17:14.534 --> 17:15.335
was present when he died.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.537
It could've been
an assisted suicide.

17:17.570 --> 17:20.107
Who discovered the body?

17:20.140 --> 17:21.808
I did.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.443
We were supposed
to go to dinner.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.113
After, did you hire a crew?

17:26.146 --> 17:27.414
Did you clean up?

17:27.447 --> 17:30.217
No, I locked the door
and I haven't been back.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.819
The place was wiped clean.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.688
No prints on the counters
or the doorknobs.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.590
Well, Matt was a slob.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.327
He didn't even own a bottle
of Windex or a rag.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.296
The building doesn't have
a doorman or a security camera.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.164
So, it's gonna be hard

17:44.197 --> 17:45.798
to track down
whoever else was there.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.434
CHARLIE:
Maybe not.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.336
Fingerprints contain acid,

17:49.369 --> 17:52.472
which wears away or corrodes
virtually any metal surface--

17:52.505 --> 17:54.474
countertops, door knobs-- even
after they've been wiped clean.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.543
How's that?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.878
Um, would you happen
to have any powder?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.680
Oh...

18:03.783 --> 18:04.684
How about a comb?

18:04.717 --> 18:07.154
You think I can get
a comb through this?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.889
Hey, Sinclair.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.524
Uh, yeah?
-Your girlfriend happen to have

18:11.558 --> 18:12.592
a comb in his desk?

18:12.625 --> 18:14.561
Uh, you need a comb?
Hold on.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.495
Oh.
-Good?

18:15.528 --> 18:17.497
Perfect, thanks.
-All right.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.532
You know what?

18:19.566 --> 18:20.333
I don't even want to know.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.535
Okay, well, uh...
(clears throat)

18:22.569 --> 18:25.205
imagine that this

18:25.238 --> 18:28.375
is a fine conducting powder.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.244
I rub the comb on my sweater,

18:31.278 --> 18:33.613
which simulates an electrical
charge that can be applied

18:33.646 --> 18:35.748
to the various metal
surfaces in the apartment.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.850
The teeth of the comb

18:37.884 --> 18:40.353
are the indents
made by the corrosion

18:40.387 --> 18:42.622
from the acid
on your fingerprints.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.857
So, where it sticks,
it's a print.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.459
Fast learner.
-How long before

18:46.493 --> 18:47.527
you can get us some results?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.262
Well, really, that falls

18:49.296 --> 18:51.364
under the auspices
of the FBI lab.

18:51.398 --> 18:54.201
With me and Amita leaving,
they should get used to

18:54.234 --> 18:55.735
solving crimes
by themselves again.

18:55.768 --> 18:56.736
(chuckles)

18:56.769 --> 18:59.239
(coughing)

19:01.741 --> 19:04.511
Oh, hey, listen,
thanks for taking me to lunch.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.646
You know, that may be
the first time

19:06.679 --> 19:09.516
that I've taken an hour's break
since I've been working there.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.551
Yeah, you have to pace yourself,
Alan.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.586
We're not scampering
children anymore.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.887
Hmm, tell me about it.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.424
At work, I'm surrounded
by zygotes with iPhones

19:17.457 --> 19:18.825
and skateboards.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.494
You know, this may be
my last chance to do something

19:21.528 --> 19:23.663
really meaningful for society.
-You know,

19:23.696 --> 19:26.399
I would argue you've already
made a lasting imprint.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.900
Yeah, from the man
who's been to space.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.570
I haven't been east
of Utah in, what, ten years?

19:30.603 --> 19:33.540
No, but your boys
both excel in their fields.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.642
They have saved
hundreds of lives. -Mm-hmm.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.844
Soon you will have a daughter,
grandchildren.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.746
Ah! -You've done
all of this without

19:39.779 --> 19:42.815
leaving the comfort
of your own home.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.885
I think I see why you like
that garage so much.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.288
Hey, hey, hey.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.626
Why do you have
multiple e-mail accounts?

19:53.660 --> 19:55.562
One for personal,
one for business,

19:55.595 --> 19:57.564
one for, you know, things.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.333
Nikki's waiting on me,
all right?

20:00.367 --> 20:02.769
Nik, the ERT report
on Matt Burrows' apartment

20:02.802 --> 20:04.637
and his phone records.

20:04.671 --> 20:05.872
You wired money
to a man in Italy

20:05.905 --> 20:07.707
who's on Interpol's hot list.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.008
Okay, you really want to know?

20:09.041 --> 20:09.809
Yeah.
-Fine, fine.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.878
I hate it
when Mom and Dad fight.

20:11.911 --> 20:15.782
Should've known this was
going to come out.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.688
Dolls?

20:21.721 --> 20:22.889
Army dolls.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.592
I don't know whether
I should laugh or cry.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.693
I'm going to laugh.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.928
(laughing)

20:31.664 --> 20:33.666
Hey, whoa, check that.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.669
I had techs run the phone
records for Sean, Devin,

20:36.703 --> 20:38.905
Mike and Matt
over the past year.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.741
One number common to all four.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.344
And the same person called
Matt Burrows three times.

20:45.645 --> 20:46.679
Hours before he died.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.049
COLBY:
"American Pioneer Hotel,"

20:50.082 --> 20:52.051
Los Angeles--
why does that sound familiar?

20:52.084 --> 20:55.822
Because Arnold Winslow,
the guy who raped Matt Burrows--

20:55.855 --> 20:57.990
that's the last place
he was seen alive.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.926
Oh, yeah, but that was
nearly 20 years ago.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.761
I mean, Winslow is supposed
to be dead.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.896
NIKKI:
Yeah, I thought so, too.

21:03.930 --> 21:04.997
Oh, it gets better.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.766
ERT ran Charlie's
Mr. Wizard test.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.736
Look whose prints they found
in Matt Burrows' apartment.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.039
Winslow's alive.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.807
He's been calling the four men

21:14.841 --> 21:16.843
that he tortured
when they were kids.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.745
I think he murdered
Matt Burrows.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.516
(indistinct yelling)

21:28.054 --> 21:31.558
So, Mike, it turns out
Arnold Winslow is alive.

21:31.591 --> 21:32.992
Great. You got an address?

21:33.025 --> 21:34.994
Maybe five minutes
alone with him?

21:35.027 --> 21:36.929
We know he called you.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.898
And I hung up
on his twisted ass.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.933
One call for a minute
and change,

21:40.967 --> 21:41.934
the other for 38 seconds.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.371
Those aren't hang-ups;
those are conversations.

21:44.404 --> 21:47.740
He also called Matt quite a bit.

21:47.774 --> 21:48.908
He was at his apartment
the day he died.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.076
So Winslow murdered him.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.878
We're not so sure about that.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.813
There's no way
it's a coincidence.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.448
Like Winslow
turning out to be alive

21:55.482 --> 21:56.549
and Devin Shepard
getting killed?

21:56.583 --> 21:57.717
(whispers):
Wow.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.419
So what do you got?

21:59.452 --> 22:00.987
Winslow's Svengali
and I'm his puppet?

22:01.020 --> 22:01.988
(chuckles)

22:02.021 --> 22:03.656
Sorry, fellas.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.492
Back to the drawing board.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.660
Winslow called me
a couple months back.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.929
He was living in some dump.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.432
He saw how well I was doing,
and he figured

22:12.465 --> 22:15.802
that I owed him something
for putting him in jail.

22:15.835 --> 22:16.903
Pretty warped sense of reality.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.105
Do I need to explain
the mind of a sociopath to you?

22:19.138 --> 22:21.541
In Winslow's head, he thinks
we have a relationship.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.443
Why didn't you contact
the police? -And tell them what?

22:23.476 --> 22:26.012
Tell them Winslow's alive and
he's, uh, asking me for money

22:26.045 --> 22:28.014
and start rehashing
everything that I put behind me?

22:28.047 --> 22:29.616
I told Mike to deal with it.

22:29.649 --> 22:32.051
He gave him 500 bucks,
he told him to disappear.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.023
COLBY: Winslow was in the Corps
from '82 to '84.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.659
Went in a private,
left the same way.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.027
Yeah, it's post-Vietnam,
but they were

22:41.060 --> 22:42.929
still teaching people
how to kill, right?

22:42.962 --> 22:45.998
It says, uh, "Other than
honorable discharge."

22:46.032 --> 22:46.933
That's the Army's way
of sweeping

22:46.966 --> 22:50.570
an uncomfortable situation
under the rug.

22:50.603 --> 22:54.574
Psych eval says,
"Confused sexual tendencies,

22:54.607 --> 22:58.911
most likely a sociopathic
personality disorder."

22:58.945 --> 23:01.748
And he gets a job as
an elementary school teacher.

23:01.781 --> 23:02.615
Ah, the record was sealed.

23:02.649 --> 23:03.950
That was part
of the discharge deal.

23:03.983 --> 23:04.951
NIKKI:
Hey, guys.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.953
You know how Winslow called

23:06.986 --> 23:09.822
Sean, Matt and Devin
from the same hotel?

23:09.856 --> 23:13.025
Manager never heard
of Arnold Winslow,

23:13.059 --> 23:16.062
but he did I.D.
the photo that the techs altered

23:16.095 --> 23:18.197
to show what Winslow
looks like today.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.200
He registered as Kurt Stark
and checked out a week ago.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.070
I'm gonna guess DMV came up
snake eyes on Stark.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.472
Good guess.

23:25.505 --> 23:28.074
But the car registered
to Stark's room

23:28.107 --> 23:30.510
actually came back
to a Nick Roland.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.044
Got plenty on him.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.580
So it looks like Arnold Winslow

23:33.613 --> 23:35.915
isn't the only one with
a penchant for little boys.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.886
Why are you looking at me?

23:39.919 --> 23:42.455
'Cause your head was in
the way of the screen.

23:42.489 --> 23:45.091
Nick Roland did his
time at the same prison

23:45.124 --> 23:46.058
as Winslow.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.794
Ah, it shouldn't be
too hard to find him.

23:47.827 --> 23:50.963
LAPD picked him up
a month ago on drug possession.

23:54.967 --> 23:55.902
Nick Roland?

23:58.938 --> 24:00.973
Whatever you think I did,
I didn't.

24:01.007 --> 24:04.076
Doing my six months in here
and getting the hell out.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.145
Maybe we can make
your six months a little easier.

24:06.178 --> 24:09.081
Your pal Winslow--

24:09.115 --> 24:12.051
found your car at his hotel.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.120
Excuse me.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.087
Come on, Nick.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.956
You two practically
shared a cell at Chino.

24:19.826 --> 24:23.095
'91, when they let him out,
they wouldn't leave him alone.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.731
Who?
-The parents.

24:24.764 --> 24:27.734
Put his photo
on telephone poles,

24:27.767 --> 24:29.636
left notes on his door,
slashed his tires.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.804
Man did his time;
he deserved to be let alone.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.205
So he faked his death?

24:34.807 --> 24:36.108
Arnold was a Marine.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.044
He knew a thing or two
about surviving.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.046
Disappeared.

24:40.079 --> 24:43.783
When he came back a few years
later, had a new identity.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.085
That identity have a name?

24:48.688 --> 24:49.656
Jay.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.891
Jeff Jay.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.095
Thanks.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.098
AMITA: Hey.

24:59.131 --> 24:59.966
Hey.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.735
So, how'd the
lie detector test go?

25:02.769 --> 25:04.737
A few more minutes,
I would have admitted to

25:04.771 --> 25:07.039
cutting the brakes
on Amelia Earhart's plane.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.641
Yeah, well,

25:08.675 --> 25:11.678
there are worse traits
than honesty.

25:11.711 --> 25:14.113
Guess you didn't have time
to input these

25:14.146 --> 25:15.214
into a decision tree.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.116
No. With the case and all...

25:24.691 --> 25:26.926
What's happening?

25:26.959 --> 25:28.160
What are you doing?

25:28.194 --> 25:30.763
The Ramanujan lie detector test.

25:30.797 --> 25:34.200
It's not as fancy as the FBI's,
but it's just as effective.

25:34.233 --> 25:38.070
You don't want to get married
in Europe, do you?

25:38.104 --> 25:41.107
Wow, this really does work.

25:41.140 --> 25:44.143
The cost of travel these days,

25:44.176 --> 25:47.046
the dollar's really weak.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.181
I want our friends
and family to be there

25:49.215 --> 25:51.083
to celebrate with us.

25:51.117 --> 25:52.318
Well...

25:52.351 --> 25:54.120
Okay.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.257
You know, I get it.
It's not practical.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.026
We'll get married
when we come home.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.263
PAULSON: Winslow must have
murdered my brother

26:04.296 --> 26:06.132
and made it look like a suicide.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.034
But why do you think he would
go after your brother

26:08.067 --> 26:09.235
after all these years?

26:09.268 --> 26:13.039
Because he's a sick psychopath.

26:13.072 --> 26:16.042
He was obsessed with Matt.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.144
Yeah, I'm gonna
tell you something.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.112
In the weeks before
your brother died,

26:20.146 --> 26:21.848
he and Winslow
were talking a lot

26:21.881 --> 26:23.215
on the phone.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.217
And those calls went both ways.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.792
Winslow was

26:32.825 --> 26:34.994
a shop teacher.

26:35.027 --> 26:38.064
The-the boys loved hearing his
stories about being a Marine.

26:40.266 --> 26:44.036
After school,
he taught private classes.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.872
The shop was just
a couple of blocks

26:45.905 --> 26:47.273
from the old Ledger building.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.008
They would, uh,

26:49.041 --> 26:52.411
build slot cars
and all kinds of cool stuff.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.214
But Winslow had to pick you.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.216
It was a really big deal.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.251
That's how he'd molest them?

27:00.352 --> 27:04.123
When he told Matt

27:04.156 --> 27:06.693
it was his turn,

27:06.726 --> 27:10.162
you should have seen
how excited he was.

27:10.196 --> 27:14.100
They met after school,
just the two of them.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.238
I could tell
that something had happened,

27:19.271 --> 27:22.174
but Matt would never tell me.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.178
(sniffles)

27:26.212 --> 27:27.880
I met your brother.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.215
Yeah?

27:29.248 --> 27:32.752
You're very lucky
to be able to work together.

27:32.785 --> 27:33.786
Yeah.

27:33.820 --> 27:34.887
We are, huh?

27:36.322 --> 27:38.357
Have you ever done anything

27:38.390 --> 27:43.162
that you were so ashamed of
that you couldn't tell anyone?

27:43.195 --> 27:44.330
Not even him?

27:49.802 --> 27:51.370
Watch this.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.977
MAN:
Don't do it!

27:58.010 --> 28:00.146
(blows landing, man screaming)

28:01.748 --> 28:03.182
Oh! Don't!

28:03.215 --> 28:06.018
Help me! Help me!

28:06.052 --> 28:07.219
(grunts)

28:07.253 --> 28:09.922
Hey, what happened?
Everything all ri...?

28:09.956 --> 28:11.123
(man screaming)

28:11.157 --> 28:13.492
(man laughing)

28:13.525 --> 28:15.361
Oh, no.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.363
(screaming)

28:17.396 --> 28:18.831
Is that Arnold Winslow?

28:18.865 --> 28:20.900
Who did that to him?

28:20.933 --> 28:22.001
Can't tell.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.170
It's pretty much all shadows,

28:24.203 --> 28:26.472
so, you know, it's really
impossible to see anything.

28:26.505 --> 28:27.940
Maybe it's not so impossible.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.010
(whispers):
Okay.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.146
What do you see?

28:34.180 --> 28:35.281
A duck.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.115
A duck? It's got ears.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.184
These are the ears.
It's a rabbit.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.385
Looks like a duck.

28:39.418 --> 28:40.787
-It's supposed
to be a rabbit. -(mutters)

28:40.820 --> 28:42.254
All right, whatever.
Listen, when I separate

28:42.288 --> 28:44.090
my two hands, you see two hands.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.125
Well, it's no different
with this video.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.795
We've got overlapping shadows
of the attackers and the victim.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.529
We have a time stamp
on this video.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.032
That'll tell us the position
of the moon that night. -Uh-huh.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.500
We factor in
additional light sources,

28:54.533 --> 28:57.103
maybe a few measurements
on the ground...

28:57.136 --> 28:58.470
we can separate these shadows.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.472
Once we have

29:00.506 --> 29:03.375
the individual shadows,
I can do a simple gait analysis.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.212
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.514
I'm gonna miss you, too.

29:08.547 --> 29:11.450
Even if you did kill my gerbil.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.925
I thought those tests were
supposed to be confidential.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.226
Mom had to rush out.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.560
She had to get another one,
remember?

29:21.593 --> 29:23.896
And I thought my whole class
was gonna hate me.

29:23.930 --> 29:27.333
I know. I thought you were gonna
kill me, man.

29:27.366 --> 29:30.436
Guess I wasn't really much
of a role model, huh?

29:30.469 --> 29:33.239
Role model?

29:33.272 --> 29:35.107
You didn't hang out
with me a lot

29:35.141 --> 29:37.109
when I was a kid.

29:37.143 --> 29:41.047
So, yeah, you were
a crappy role model, but...

29:41.080 --> 29:42.481
it's okay.

29:42.514 --> 29:45.217
What happens when you're a kid
doesn't have to haunt you

29:45.251 --> 29:47.920
for the rest
of your life, right?

29:47.954 --> 29:50.289
Like to think I changed
a little bit, though.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.158
You totally did.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.993
That's why,
after all these years,

29:54.026 --> 29:55.361
I've finally been able
to forgive you.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.063
Thanks.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.198
Although, just to be clear,
I haven't forgiven you.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.199
(sighs)

30:00.232 --> 30:02.234
I mean, you lit his fur on fire?

30:02.268 --> 30:04.003
Mr. Winks?

30:04.036 --> 30:05.337
He had a family.

30:05.371 --> 30:06.505
The worse part was the smell.

30:06.538 --> 30:10.176
Smelled like a combination
of bananas and polyurethane.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.177
(laughs)

30:11.210 --> 30:12.578
Phew! He was gone.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.313
(Winslow screaming on monitor)

30:19.418 --> 30:21.453
Video time stamp puts it

30:21.487 --> 30:25.357
six months after Winslow
was released from prison.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.329
That man made a lot of enemies.

30:30.362 --> 30:33.499
From this video, it looks like
one of them caught up with him.

30:33.532 --> 30:34.533
Three.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.335
One was holding
the video camera,

30:36.368 --> 30:41.240
while the others were raping him
with a baseball bat.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.042
So of course it's got to be me.
-Come on.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.412
You were 16 years old.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.381
Your testosterone mixed
with too much beer.

30:49.415 --> 30:50.649
You were looking for payback.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.151
When I was ten years old,

30:52.184 --> 30:54.253
I stood up in court
and I testified

30:54.286 --> 30:55.321
against Arnold Winslow.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.156
That is my idea of revenge.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.490
"Either you believe

30:58.524 --> 31:03.229
in our system of justice...
or you don't."

31:03.262 --> 31:06.398
There aren't two sets
of standards, Sean,

31:06.432 --> 31:10.169
regardless of what happened
to you in 1985.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.537
Wow.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.340
(chuckles)

31:14.373 --> 31:17.409
With all due respect, David,

31:17.443 --> 31:20.947
you don't have a clue
what happened in 1985.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.348
Or '91.

31:25.551 --> 31:26.986
-Twenty-two!
-(indistinct shouting)

31:28.420 --> 31:30.222
-Got him.
-Yes!

31:30.256 --> 31:31.557
Nice.

31:31.590 --> 31:32.558
Good play.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.260
Good day, good day.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.462
NIKKI:
What do you think?

31:36.495 --> 31:38.697
LIZ: Ugly, no matter
what name he uses.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.699
Let's go get him.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.002
Mary Paulson.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.004
Did you murder Matt Burrows,
one of the boys that...

31:45.037 --> 31:47.506
Crap. What is she doing here?
-...'85?

31:47.539 --> 31:49.275
What are you talking about?
Who are you? Get away from me!

31:49.308 --> 31:51.510
The FBI has your DNA evidence
at the crime scene.

31:51.543 --> 31:52.544
Did you kill my brother?!

31:52.578 --> 31:53.946
-FBI!
-Hey!

31:53.980 --> 31:55.047
(indistinct shouting)

31:56.615 --> 31:57.683
Yo. Yo, heads up.
-What's going on?

31:57.716 --> 31:59.318
(grunts loudly)

31:59.351 --> 32:01.153
FBI! You're under arrest!
-All right, everyone stay back!

32:01.187 --> 32:03.055
Keep rolling, Leo.
-(groaning)

32:03.089 --> 32:05.024
Great clothesline, buddy.
-(handcuffs clicking)

32:05.057 --> 32:06.158
(screams)

32:11.763 --> 32:14.333
Hey.
-Hey.

32:14.366 --> 32:17.303
Are you analyzing terrorist
camps for the CIA again?

32:17.336 --> 32:20.006
Shadow analysis
of some old video for Don.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.107
You know, my measurements
are sound,

32:21.140 --> 32:25.011
I pulled data from NASA,
and the math is all correct,

32:25.044 --> 32:26.345
but the results are off.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.315
Is that the date

32:29.348 --> 32:31.183
you've been using?
-Yeah.

32:31.217 --> 32:34.020
You need to be calculating
for a full moon.

32:34.053 --> 32:35.754
I mean, look at
your frame there.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.589
The date and the time stamp
on the camera--

32:37.623 --> 32:38.590
that's wrong.
Those are incorrect.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.026
Of course!

32:40.059 --> 32:42.161
Okay, so I need
to look up the date...

32:42.194 --> 32:44.463
No. January 30,
February 28,

32:44.496 --> 32:47.066
March 30, April 28.

32:47.099 --> 32:48.500
Uh, ditto for May.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.069
June's the 27th.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.637
July is 26.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.372
August 25.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.407
Then September,
October 23.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.376
November, December 21.

32:57.409 --> 33:00.379
Larry... I'm glad you're back.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.315
Speaking of which,
with you and Amita going away

33:03.349 --> 33:04.450
and this supercomputer

33:04.483 --> 33:07.086
taking its sweet time
with my data,

33:07.119 --> 33:09.721
I'm thinking about asking Don
if I could just, uh,

33:09.755 --> 33:11.590
you know, pick up
some of the slack.

33:11.623 --> 33:14.093
He'd be thrilled to have you.
As thrilled as he gets.

33:14.126 --> 33:17.329
T.E. Lawrence,
The Seven Pillars of Wisdom?

33:17.363 --> 33:19.065
Yeah. Lawrence of Arabia.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.067
The ultimate
desert survival tool.

33:21.100 --> 33:24.436
Hey, there's a location idea
for your wedding.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.138
Very uncluttered.

33:26.172 --> 33:28.540
Our decision tree says Milan,

33:28.574 --> 33:30.176
but I'm thinking
a wedding in Italy,

33:30.209 --> 33:32.644
or anywhere overseas,
is not very economical.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.247
Lawrence was able
to capture Aqaba

33:35.281 --> 33:36.548
because the Turks didn't think

33:36.582 --> 33:38.150
he could survive
a desert crossing.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.320
Surprise her.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.595
Your prints and DNA

33:49.628 --> 33:52.564
were all over
Matt Burrows' apartment.

33:52.598 --> 33:55.701
You think I killed Matty?

33:55.734 --> 33:57.836
Billion to one chance
that you didn't.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.338
We know they raped you.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.807
Matt Burrows had a videotape.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.544
After I moved home.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.846
But it wasn't
really home anymore;

34:07.879 --> 34:09.148
everything had changed.

34:09.181 --> 34:13.152
Sean and Matt and all of them--

34:13.185 --> 34:14.720
they weren't kids anymore.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.489
I made a point to avoid them.

34:17.523 --> 34:20.659
I didn't want any trouble.

34:20.692 --> 34:23.629
One night,
I was walking home

34:23.662 --> 34:25.397
and they jumped me.

34:25.431 --> 34:28.200
Took me on a ride.

34:28.234 --> 34:31.237
And after
they were done with me,

34:31.270 --> 34:34.840
they left me choking
on my own blood.

34:34.873 --> 34:35.807
I would have died,

34:35.841 --> 34:39.245
but Matt came back,
and he turned me over.

34:39.278 --> 34:40.679
But everybody
thought you were dead.

34:40.712 --> 34:41.847
-Yep.
-Yeah.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.484
It was Matt's idea about Mexico.

34:45.517 --> 34:48.220
I wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for him.

34:48.254 --> 34:51.823
He's the last person
I'd ever hurt.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.596
You phoned each of them several
times over the last month.

34:59.331 --> 35:02.168
Matt, three times
the day he died.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.169
Yeah.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.603
After I got back from Mexico,

35:04.636 --> 35:08.207
Matt and I... talked.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.243
He felt guilty

35:11.277 --> 35:13.345
about what they'd done to me.

35:13.379 --> 35:16.282
And he told me
there was a videotape.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.150
Proof.

35:18.184 --> 35:21.620
Sean and Devin had pretty nice
careers going for them.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.555
And I figured a rape charge,

35:23.589 --> 35:26.192
even against me--

35:26.225 --> 35:27.926
that'd mess up
their lives pretty good.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.328
(bangs table)

35:29.361 --> 35:32.164
What were you doing
at Matt's apartment?

35:32.198 --> 35:34.166
I was trying to find
a copy of the videotape.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.268
$500 didn't get me very far.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.273
By the time I got there,
he was dead,

35:41.307 --> 35:42.708
so I wiped the place down.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.676
I panicked. I ran.

35:47.379 --> 35:51.583
You have that murderer there,
and I'm under arrest?

35:51.617 --> 35:53.319
Winslow was on public property.

35:53.352 --> 35:54.786
I had every right to pursue him.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.794
Sergeant over at LAPD owed me.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.596
And I'm not giving up any names.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.932
But you alerted the LAPD
that you were going to make

36:06.965 --> 36:09.801
an arrest on their turf,
and they alerted me.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.404
Can I go now?

36:12.438 --> 36:13.672
Tell me about that DVD.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.609
Matt loved movies.

36:17.643 --> 36:20.279
His 16th birthday,
Dad surprised him,

36:20.312 --> 36:22.414
gave him a video camera.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.350
He took it everywhere.

36:24.383 --> 36:27.319
After he died, I found
the tape in the camera.

36:27.353 --> 36:30.589
He must have been watching it
the day he killed himself.

36:32.924 --> 36:34.860
Thanks.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.299
Hey, you guys.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.000
We've got some results
for you here.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.703
Once we separated the shadows

36:44.736 --> 36:46.305
and recalibrated
their proper lengths,

36:46.338 --> 36:48.006
the gait analysis
was fairly easy.

36:48.039 --> 36:51.343
All right, now,
the first shadow, here--

36:51.377 --> 36:53.679
that belongs to Matt Burrows.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.248
The next one's a little tougher.

36:56.282 --> 36:57.516
We were able
to match the movement

36:57.549 --> 36:58.950
of the shadow as it ran away.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.020
Mike Nash.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.088
Finally, we have

37:03.121 --> 37:06.725
the individual holding
the, uh, the baseball bat.

37:08.427 --> 37:09.561
Sean Westmark.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.297
Okay. Where's Devin?

37:11.330 --> 37:12.298
Not there.

37:12.331 --> 37:15.033
Unless, of course,
he doesn't have a shadow.

37:15.066 --> 37:18.970
We have proof that you
and Sean raped Arnold Winslow.

37:19.004 --> 37:22.374
Video that Matt took that night.

37:22.408 --> 37:24.943
Where was Devin?

37:24.976 --> 37:27.846
The little wimp was afraid.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.582
Didn't even get out of his car.

37:30.616 --> 37:34.453
He never touched Winslow?

37:34.486 --> 37:38.023
I don't remember seeing
Devin after they jumped me.

37:38.056 --> 37:40.359
But you tried to blackmail him.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.793
Yeah. Why not?

37:41.827 --> 37:42.894
He was there.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.296
Somewhere.

37:44.330 --> 37:46.432
So, what happened
when you contacted him?

37:46.465 --> 37:47.733
He wouldn't pay.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.401
I threatened him with the tape,

37:49.435 --> 37:51.337
and he didn't seem
too concerned.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.705
Devin was always afraid.

37:53.739 --> 37:56.875
He was afraid to...
to fight back,

37:56.908 --> 37:58.910
to stand up for himself.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.779
Winslow raped him,

38:00.812 --> 38:03.449
and this was his chance
to get even.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.520
He couldn't even watch.

38:08.554 --> 38:11.357
Devin was going to cut
a deal for himself.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.425
Testify against

38:13.459 --> 38:15.661
you, Matt and Sean.

38:15.694 --> 38:18.797
Like I said, Devin had no honor.

38:18.830 --> 38:21.433
He had no idea
what loyalty meant.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.769
COLBY:
So, you never

38:23.802 --> 38:25.671
actually had a copy of the tape?

38:25.704 --> 38:27.573
WINSLOW:
No. I bluffed Nash.

38:27.606 --> 38:30.376
I knew he couldn't risk
not paying me.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.878
And I told Sean
if anything happened to me,

38:32.911 --> 38:35.414
that tape was going
to wind up at the L.A. Times.

38:35.447 --> 38:36.948
You mean Mike Nash.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.116
No, I mean Sean.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.051
Mike didn't scare me.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.454
I mean, maybe he pulled
the trigger on Devin,

38:42.488 --> 38:44.456
but Sean pulled all the strings.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.091
It was always that way.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.059
Even as kids.

38:50.128 --> 38:52.063
*

38:54.500 --> 38:55.634
(siren wailing)

39:03.475 --> 39:06.478
* Close your eyes

39:06.512 --> 39:08.647
* And picture this

39:08.680 --> 39:11.450
NIKKI:
Sean Westmark? FBI.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.552
Get back.

39:13.585 --> 39:16.522
You know, this is
where I was tied up.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.424
This is where it all happened.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.828
It was only a couple hours,
you know,

39:22.861 --> 39:27.566
but it felt like an eternity.

39:27.599 --> 39:31.136
You don't realize
what it means to be free

39:31.169 --> 39:33.539
until you're not.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.507
It's over.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.545
We got Winslow.

39:39.578 --> 39:42.681
You know, the whole time,

39:42.714 --> 39:45.183
I'm just thinking,

39:45.216 --> 39:48.554
"Ricky Shuster is gonna get
my spot on the baseball team."

39:48.587 --> 39:50.589
(sniffles)

39:50.622 --> 39:51.990
Put the gun down.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.426
You know, ironically,

39:54.460 --> 39:57.696
I probably would not even be
the same man that I am today

39:57.729 --> 40:01.199
if I'd never met Arnold Winslow.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.134
(chuckles)

40:05.804 --> 40:08.840
(chuckling continues)

40:08.874 --> 40:12.010
You know,
Matt is dead because of him.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.212
Matt's dead because he couldn't
live with the guilt.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.982
No, we agreed

40:17.015 --> 40:19.751
to destroy the videotape.

40:19.785 --> 40:20.952
And Matt didn't.

40:20.986 --> 40:21.987
He couldn't.

40:31.563 --> 40:35.200
Arnold Winslow ruined our lives.

40:37.636 --> 40:39.571
And now,
he's ruining mine again.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.442
How is that fair?

40:46.578 --> 40:49.581
(sniffles, sighs)

40:49.615 --> 40:53.652
* Save yourself

40:53.685 --> 40:55.521
* Save...

40:55.554 --> 40:56.555
-No!
-Don't!

40:56.588 --> 40:57.523
(gunshot)

41:00.058 --> 41:02.661
DON: What kind of story
you think you're going to do?

41:02.694 --> 41:04.095
I don't know.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.231
What story can you tell
when there are no heroes?

41:06.264 --> 41:07.465
Your brother definitely

41:07.499 --> 41:10.502
had his demons, but, I mean,
he did go back to save Winslow.

41:10.536 --> 41:13.038
Yeah, but if he hadn't,
he'd be alive, wouldn't he?

41:13.071 --> 41:16.241
Maybe, but you know,
"He who saves a life

41:16.274 --> 41:19.511
saves the world entire."

41:19.545 --> 41:21.513
Even scum like Arnold Winslow?

41:21.547 --> 41:23.549
I think so.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.717
You should tell that story.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.927
So, you all done?

41:35.961 --> 41:36.962
Uh-huh, yeah.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.764
For another five years.

41:38.797 --> 41:40.165
How did Charlie do
on his polygraph?

41:40.198 --> 41:41.667
Uh, he passed.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.635
The third time.

41:43.669 --> 41:46.572
Don't close up the personnel
files just yet. You forgot one.

41:46.605 --> 41:47.673
One what?

41:47.706 --> 41:49.908
Agent Sinclair.

41:49.941 --> 41:53.679
Woefully behind
on his physical training.

41:53.712 --> 41:55.747
("New Soul"
by Yael NaГЇm playing)

41:55.781 --> 41:57.082
(chuckles):
No.

41:57.115 --> 41:59.117
Oh, yeah.

41:59.150 --> 42:01.286
(whistle blows)

42:01.319 --> 42:03.188
Let's go.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.557
Small feet.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.126
Dinner is served.

42:08.159 --> 42:09.995
-Hey.
-Oh, what a treat.

42:10.028 --> 42:13.031
Does your dad
always cook like this?

42:13.064 --> 42:15.166
Oh, only when he's trying
to impress the boss.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.167
Oh. Mission accomplished.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.969
Hey. What's happening?

42:18.003 --> 42:19.705
Your parking pass, my friend.

42:19.738 --> 42:21.773
-Ah.
-Uh-uh!

42:21.807 --> 42:23.141
Wait a second.
I never got a parking pass.

42:23.174 --> 42:24.576
Why does he get one?

42:24.610 --> 42:27.178
Maybe because I never
killed anyone's gerbil.

42:27.212 --> 42:28.647
Oh, now everybody
knows about that?

42:28.680 --> 42:29.981
Look, we're partners now.

42:30.015 --> 42:31.049
You know? No secrets.

42:31.082 --> 42:32.250
Wow.

42:32.283 --> 42:34.219
Anyway, we are late because...

42:34.252 --> 42:35.987
There is plenty
of beer in the fridge.

42:36.021 --> 42:38.223
But there is no Dom PГ©rignon.

42:38.256 --> 42:39.658
Wow. Well, look at this.

42:39.691 --> 42:40.491
Oh, wow.
-(cork pops)

42:40.525 --> 42:43.228
Charlie and I
are getting married.

42:43.261 --> 42:44.362
Not exactly new information,
you know?

42:44.395 --> 42:47.866
We're getting married...
tomorrow.

42:47.899 --> 42:48.700
DON:
What?

42:48.734 --> 42:50.602
LARRY: Okay,
that's new information.

42:50.636 --> 42:51.903
Got quite some family here,
Eppes.

42:51.937 --> 42:53.238
You're not kidding, are you?

42:53.271 --> 42:54.606
-No.
-Nope.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.141
(chuckles)

42:56.174 --> 42:59.077
Friend of mine once said
that this house is magical.

43:01.046 --> 43:02.948
I think he's right.

43:02.981 --> 43:04.282
Yeah. Cheers.

43:04.315 --> 43:06.117
Cheers.
-Cheers.

43:06.151 --> 43:07.653
Again.
(chuckles)

43:07.686 --> 43:09.254
Oh, at last.

43:09.287 --> 43:10.656
We don't know.
-No.

43:10.689 --> 43:12.658
Somewhere.
-It's all very last-minute.

43:12.691 --> 43:15.093
* La, la, la, la, la, la

43:15.126 --> 43:16.762
* La, la, la, la, la

43:16.795 --> 43:18.730
* La, la, la, la, la, la

43:20.799 --> 43:22.634
* Ooh.

43:51.396 --> 43:52.397
(gunshot)
