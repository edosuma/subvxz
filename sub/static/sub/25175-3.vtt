Previously on
Condor...

00:03.280 --> 00:05.009
Joe, are you okay?
What happened to you?

00:05.120 --> 00:06.906
If I talk about it,
I'll sound crazy.

00:07.010 --> 00:10.502
Someone out there could still
have weaponlzed plague.

00:10.610 --> 00:14.228
Someone made a move,
knowing vaccine stock piles
would be depleted.

00:14.330 --> 00:17.276
Gareth has been
doing some trades.
We're exposed.

00:17.380 --> 00:20.190
[Nathan]
1' already sent
the assignment to the assets.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.597
Sharla called me a hypocrite.

-[grunts]

00:32.670 --> 00:35.241
[male newscaster]
It appears the shooter
was Joseph Turner.

00:35.350 --> 00:38.410
-What the f_uck is that?
The suspect is at large,
and presumed to be dangerous.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.408
Joe had nothing to do
with what happened here today.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.636
You recruited him,
you trained him.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.282
-[tires screech]
-Get in!

00:47.530 --> 00:49.339
I'm gonna put you
somewhere safe, Joe.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.589
And when this whole thing
is over with, you're not
gonna want to tell people

00:51.690 --> 00:53.260
-what we--
-What do you think
we're gonna do, Sam, huh?

00:53.370 --> 00:54.541
-Huh?
-Listen, if I told you--

00:54.650 --> 00:56.652
Joe! [grunts]

[keyboard clacking]

01:52.790 --> 01:54.781
When's your flight to Riyadh?

01:58.360 --> 02:00.351
I'm jealous they picked you.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.299
Which is why they picked you.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.391
Because this isn't fun for you.

02:08.690 --> 02:10.681
[Deacon sighs]

02:12.370 --> 02:14.304
You know, I read your file.

02:14.410 --> 02:16.765
I read the description
of what they did to you.

02:21.020 --> 02:22.829
But when I see
what you've become,

02:22.940 --> 02:24.931
I'm sure you left
something out.

02:29.510 --> 02:31.501
Tell me... What is it?

02:34.950 --> 02:36.941
[Joubert]
Something you
can ’t admit

02:37.640 --> 02:39.631
Even to yourse/ﬁ

02:40.680 --> 02:42.671
What did they do to you?

02:44.800 --> 02:49.260
The irony is, you hate them,
but you ’ve become them...

02:49.370 --> 02:51.486
-[breathes heavily]
-... which is the worst thing
they’ve done to you.

You're three hours late.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.471
It's my night.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.238
-Are you okay?
-I am not going to argue
with you.

04:09.170 --> 04:11.161
It's my night.

[Chloe whimpers]

04:27.780 --> 04:28.883
-Daddy. ..
-Yeah.

04:28.990 --> 04:30.287
I'm glad you came to get me.

04:30.390 --> 04:32.881
Oh, thank you. I'm glad
I came to get you, too.

04:32.990 --> 04:34.981
-[Chloe] I love you.
-I love you.

04:36.390 --> 04:37.800
[Chloe] Can you stay with me,

04:37.910 --> 04:39.013
until I fall asleep,

04:39.120 --> 04:41.156
-so I don't get bad dreams?
-Of course.

Uh...

05:31.410 --> 05:33.469
-Yeah...
-Is everything okay?

05:33.570 --> 05:36.459
Oh, fine. I just broke a glass.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.709
I woke you, I'm sorry.

05:38.810 --> 05:40.710
[Nathan]
Come on, lets...
Let's go back to bed.

05:40.820 --> 05:43.129
I, I'm sorry, I woke you.

[woman laughing]

07:03.940 --> 07:05.931
Sarah, where are you?

07:07.260 --> 07:09.717
Listen, I'm sorry about
what I said last night,

07:09.820 --> 07:12.800
I was just angry,
and, just... [srghs]

07:12.910 --> 07:14.844
And I know
that I look great tonight,

07:14.950 --> 07:16.884
because I'm getting
hit on left and right,

07:16.990 --> 07:19.367
so don't let it go
to waste, okay?

07:19.470 --> 07:21.176
Get your ass over here.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.293
Love you.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.334
I love you.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.295
[female newscaster]
How many
of these mass shootings are we
going to have to live through?

07:28.400 --> 07:31.779
Those of us who are
lucky enough to live through...

07:31.890 --> 07:34.358
...before Congress responds
with a little sanity...

07:38.970 --> 07:43.191
There was a study
released just last week
that definitive/y . .

07:43.300 --> 07:45.291
Hey. I still haven't
heard from you.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.193
Just give me a call, okay?

07:48.300 --> 07:50.291
I love you.

07:52.070 --> 07:54.129
-[women laughing]
-What was her name again?

07:54.230 --> 07:58.121
_ -Tatiana? _ _
-No, It was... It was TItIana.

07:58.230 --> 08:00.937
-No one has that name.
-That's why I remember it.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.691
Ask Sharla. Sharla?

08:03.800 --> 08:05.916
Hey, it's, uh, me again.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.576
Where are you?

08:08.680 --> 08:10.807
Will you call me?
I'm getting worried.

08:20.980 --> 08:22.436
-[laughing]
-[Amal] Seriously...

08:22.540 --> 08:23.871
Why don't you go back
to your own fucking country?

08:23.980 --> 08:26.153
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

08:26.260 --> 08:29.149
This fucking guy
just told me to go back
to my own fucking country.

08:32.230 --> 08:34.164
I'm sorry. My friend's drunk.
He didn't mean it.

08:34.270 --> 08:37.000
Yeah, well, my friend here's
a federal agent. She'll kick
your friend's fucking' ass.

08:37.110 --> 08:39.169
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's try not to announce
that to people, okay?

08:39.270 --> 08:41.295
-Alexandria, you cock!
-[laughing]

08:41.400 --> 08:42.936
He might think you mean Egypt.

08:43.040 --> 08:45.611
[scoffs] Yeah, right.
Like he knows
where Egypt is?

08:45.720 --> 08:47.915
-[Sharla chuckles]
-Did you guys hear about this?

08:49.400 --> 08:51.721
Eleven people
in Georgetown were...

08:53.050 --> 08:54.938
Oh, my God!

08:55.050 --> 08:57.041
What?

08:58.050 --> 08:59.506
What?

08:59.610 --> 09:01.396
[cell phone ringing]

09:01.500 --> 09:03.491
[Mae sighs]

09:14.270 --> 09:16.261
Hello?

09:18.190 --> 09:20.181
Yes, this is she.

[suspenseful music playing]

10:10.680 --> 10:12.682
[Marty gasps]

10:50.120 --> 10:52.111
You're gonna eat your eggs?

10:54.890 --> 10:56.300
You're mad at me.

10:56.410 --> 11:00.062
Mad is what I get
when someone shows up
45 minutes late to a date

11:00.170 --> 11:02.673
and then watches football
the entire time.

11:02.780 --> 11:05.715
-When someone assaults me
and takes me hostage--
-Yeah, well, I didn't want to.

11:05.820 --> 11:08.630
-But you fucking did!
-You know what? I'm sorry.

11:08.740 --> 11:11.152
-I'm not sure what I thought
was gonna happen--
-Those are just words, Joe.

11:11.260 --> 11:13.262
-I didn't think I was gonna--
-Meaningless empty words.

11:14.150 --> 11:15.526
[Joe sighs]

11:15.630 --> 11:17.621
You're right.

11:20.310 --> 11:22.301
I'm gonna have more eggs.
You want more?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.271
No? Okay.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.831
[Joe sighs]

11:33.410 --> 11:35.344
I have to feed
my neighbor's cat.

11:35.450 --> 11:38.499
Your neighbor's cat
might have to
fend for itself a while.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.601
IfI don't feed him, he'll die.

11:41.770 --> 11:43.772
Cats sometimes die.

11:48.380 --> 11:50.234
It's kind of cliche, isn't it?

11:50.340 --> 11:53.639
-For a crazy person
to think he's in the CIA?
-Yeah, yeah, I guess it is.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.639
And since you can't convince
someone who thinks you're crazy
that you're not,

11:56.750 --> 11:59.321
this is an unconstructive
conversation.

11:59.430 --> 12:01.648
That went from remorse
to fuck you pretty quickly.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.310
Yeah, well, you convinced me
that remorse_ was a waste
of time.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.231
[sighs]

12:08.600 --> 12:10.215
What's your password?

12:10.320 --> 12:11.730
Fuck off.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.250
All lowercase?

12:13.360 --> 12:14.702
It's never gonna happen.

12:14.810 --> 12:17.142
-Never. _
-Let me explain something
to you.

12:17.250 --> 12:20.139
The sooner I can figure out
what's going on,

12:20.250 --> 12:22.241
the sooner I can leave
your house.

12:23.780 --> 12:26.078
I'm pretty sure for you
to figure out what's going on,

12:26.180 --> 12:28.853
it would probably require
the aid of a psychiatrist.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.516
[Joe sighs]

12:33.620 --> 12:36.885
If you let me use your laptop,
I promise I will try to feed
the neighbor's cat

12:36.990 --> 12:38.981
once it gets dark.

12:40.870 --> 12:43.782
What makes you think I trust
anything you say?

12:48.240 --> 12:50.231
You have my word.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.242
Please.

12:56.410 --> 12:58.401
Please.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.291
The instructions
are on the fridge.

13:07.740 --> 13:09.992
Key is in the top drawer.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.091
Just go out the back yard
through the alley.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.062
The password?

13:18.470 --> 13:20.279
He was conflicted.

13:20.390 --> 13:22.381
Conflicted about what?

13:23.510 --> 13:25.774
About working for the CIA.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.871
Did you mention this
to your husband?

13:28.840 --> 13:30.831
It wasn't a secret.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.385
How much longer
do we have to do this?

13:34.490 --> 13:38.688
Did Turner ever display
any sympathies
towards foreign enemies?

13:40.850 --> 13:42.420
Define "sympathies".

13:42.530 --> 13:45.374
Did he ever say anything
in support of
a foreign government?

13:47.180 --> 13:49.171
All the time.

13:49.740 --> 13:51.514
But not in the way
that you mean.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.611
In what way?

13:55.350 --> 13:59.389
In a way that acknowledges
we're not the only ones
who think we're the good guys.

14:01.310 --> 14:05.189
Do you believe it's possible
that Joe_ Turner was
a foreign agent?

14:07.520 --> 14:09.511
I think Mrs. Barber
could use a break.

14:18.010 --> 14:21.844
Well, I know you're not okay,
and I'm not going to ask
if you are.

14:23.810 --> 14:25.812
[sighs]

14:26.980 --> 14:30.393
But I have to give a report
to the director this morning

14:30.500 --> 14:35.620
and I find myself
in the unusual position
of not knowing what to say.

14:37.390 --> 14:40.723
I've known Sam for six years,
and up until a few hours ago,

14:40.830 --> 14:43.924
he was one of my most trusted
friends and colleagues.

14:44.030 --> 14:47.488
But, Mae, Sam was somewhere
he wasn't supposed to be.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.296
And he was doing something
he wasn't supposed to be doing.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.129
What?

14:52.240 --> 14:54.231
I was hoping you would
tell me what.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.300
I, I don't... I don't know.

14:58.410 --> 15:00.708
If there was anything,
and it came out,

15:00.810 --> 15:02.505
it could be damaging
to the agency.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.146
Fuck the agency.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.912
It could be damaging
to your family.

15:07.020 --> 15:09.397
-Is that a threat?
-No, of course not.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.434
We look after our own.

15:11.540 --> 15:14.031
But, Mae, I need to know

15:14.140 --> 15:15.880
what Sam was doing.

15:15.990 --> 15:17.844
And who do toy think
needs to know that more?

15:17.950 --> 15:19.941
The CIA?

15:20.590 --> 15:22.581
Or his widow?

15:24.830 --> 15:27.936
I'm honestly a little thrown
right now, you coming here
and you asking me

15:28.040 --> 15:31.168
of all people
what my husband was up to.

15:31.280 --> 15:34.158
What do you see, a fucking
secret decoder ring
on my finger?

15:35.850 --> 15:37.841
You're right.

15:40.970 --> 15:42.744
If you wouldn't mind
I have to go tell my sons

15:42.850 --> 15:44.841
that their father's dead.

15:45.410 --> 15:47.412
You know where the door is.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.716
[Reuel] Dear Lord,
_ I know that Mae
IS ngeVIng right now,

15:54.820 --> 15:57.766
and she can't see the plans
you have for her.

15:57.870 --> 16:00.839
Allow her to find peace
and comfort

16:00.950 --> 16:02.941
in your everlasting love.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.021
Amen.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.539
I love you.
I love you.

16:08.640 --> 16:12.337
I love you, Sarah Shepard

16:12.440 --> 16:15.694
And I don't care who knows

16:15.800 --> 16:18.348
- Yeah, except for her parents.
50... Yeah.
-[Sarah chuckling]

16:18.450 --> 16:20.907
[Sarah on video]
Uh-oh, I don’t think
it’s your parents.

16:21.010 --> 16:22.227
[cell phone vibrates]

16:22.330 --> 16:24.321
[sniffles]

16:24.690 --> 16:26.692
Hello?

16:28.500 --> 16:30.491
Uh, yes, sir.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.859
Uh, sorry, sir, did they say
what they wanted with me?

16:50.440 --> 16:52.431
[car beeps]

17:06.130 --> 17:08.189
[both gasp]

17:08.300 --> 17:10.689
-Pardon me.
-Yeah. It's okay.

17:17.550 --> 17:19.620
[indistinct chattering]

17:39.570 --> 17:41.185
My office. Now.

17:41.290 --> 17:43.281
I think she means me.

17:45.050 --> 17:46.506
-Shepard?
-Hmm.

17:46.610 --> 17:48.077
-Shepard, Sharla?
-Yeah.

17:48.180 --> 17:50.250
Hoyle, IT.
Let me get your thumb.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.439
-Why?
-Put you in the system.

17:53.540 --> 17:57.158
-What system?
-Centr_al database
for the Investigation?

17:57.260 --> 17:59.046
The biometric reader
on the laptop
you're being issued

17:59.150 --> 18:01.527
uses your thumbprint
to log you onto the server.

18:01.630 --> 18:03.518
Yeah, but I'm not
on this case, so...

18:03.630 --> 18:05.621
Then what are you doing here?

18:07.440 --> 18:09.431
Uh...

18:14.960 --> 18:18.100
So... What the fuck
are you doing here?

18:18.210 --> 18:22.988
I'm bringing you
my personal files for IEP.

18:23.090 --> 18:25.820
Uh-huh. You ever hear of email?

18:25.930 --> 18:28.034
Well, I only have hard copies.
I'm old school.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.199
[chuckles]
Don't lie to me, Bob.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.632
If anybody knows what you
look like when you're lying,
it's me.

18:32.740 --> 18:35.356
I'm not lying. I wanted you
to see my files

18:35.460 --> 18:37.234
so you could know the man
you're hunting--

18:37.340 --> 18:39.205
But I don't need your input,
I'm good.

18:39.310 --> 18:41.540
[Bob] I've known him
since he was born.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.181
You men and your boys.

18:45.630 --> 18:47.564
I've seen this so many times.

18:47.670 --> 18:49.854
Latent homosexual impulses
don't get released

18:49.960 --> 18:51.996
and eventually your brains
fill up with jizz.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.576
Marty,

18:54.680 --> 18:56.739
you might wanna consider
the possibility that
you've been trying

18:56.840 --> 18:58.387
to get in the boys' club
for so long

18:58.490 --> 18:59.582
that your ovaries
have shriveled up

18:59.690 --> 19:01.681
and you lost
your woman's intuition.

19:04.690 --> 19:06.681
You're a mean son of a bitch.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.828
I can tell you

19:11.940 --> 19:16.673
that it has taken me a really
long time to get to the point
where, in all honesty,

19:16.780 --> 19:19.465
I can say that I no longer
bear you a grudge.

19:21.710 --> 19:23.166
But if you come in here,

19:23.270 --> 19:26.364
and you mess
with my investigation,

19:26.470 --> 19:29.974
I will fuck you,
and not in the fun way.

19:30.080 --> 19:32.310
I came here to bring you
these files.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.056
I have more important things
to do

19:35.160 --> 19:36.570
_ than fuck_ _
With your Investigation.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.682
That's the one.

19:39.650 --> 19:42.619
-I'm sorry?
-That's that look

19:42.730 --> 19:45.779
that you would have every time
you'd call Lily to tell her

19:45.890 --> 19:47.881
that you were working late.

19:53.060 --> 19:55.051
He didn't kill anyone.

19:58.620 --> 20:00.622
[indistinct chattering]

20:32.660 --> 20:34.651
[soft instrumental
music playing]

20:38.300 --> 20:40.302
[sobbing]

20:55.480 --> 20:57.471
What are you doing
on the floor?

21:03.250 --> 21:05.241
What's wrong, mommy?

21:13.700 --> 21:16.089
Sammy, I need to talk
to you guys.

21:17.780 --> 21:20.283
I gotta...
I gotta get ready for school.

21:20.390 --> 21:22.381
Well, there's no school today.

21:22.790 --> 21:24.781
Why? Did something happen?

21:28.510 --> 21:30.512
Dad...

21:31.480 --> 21:33.471
[Mae sobbing]

21:35.360 --> 21:37.351
Well, dad's gone.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.602
-Where did he go?
-He...

21:44.410 --> 21:46.401
He died.

21:47.530 --> 21:49.418
What are you talking about?
I saw him yesterday.

21:49.530 --> 21:51.532
[Mae crying]

21:52.940 --> 21:54.749
Did he get cancer?

21:54.860 --> 21:56.851
[sobbing] No.

21:58.580 --> 22:01.299
-He was shot.
-By who?

22:04.990 --> 22:06.981
I don't know.

22:08.070 --> 22:10.061
[Mae crying]

22:16.840 --> 22:18.831
I gotta get ready for school.

22:20.570 --> 22:22.640
I don't wanna go to school.

22:28.650 --> 22:30.436
[male newscaster]
The unfortunate fact
of the matter Is

22:30.540 --> 22:33.714
we st/l/ have no idea
who, who Ammar lVazar/ was,

22:33.820 --> 22:35.356
or who he was working for.

22:35.460 --> 22:37.633
And what’s most tern'fy/ng

22:37.740 --> 22:39.890
we don ’t know if those people
are st/l/ in possession of
a weapon/zed bubonic plague

22:39.980 --> 22:41.800
that they intend to use
on Americans

22:41.910 --> 22:43.684
-[Nathan] Here you go.
-[newscaster]
It isn ’t
something l/ke

22:43.790 --> 22:46.759
a dangerous substance
Me the plague virus...

22:46.870 --> 22:49.805
-Thanks, Daddy.
-You're welcome.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.071
[ma/e newscaster]
The scary
truth is that you cannot
realistically--

22:56.560 --> 22:57.811
[Chloe] I wanna know
what's happening.

22:57.920 --> 22:58.989
[male newscaster]
It’s a naturally occurring. . .

22:59.080 --> 23:00.945
Everyone at school
is really scared.

23:01.050 --> 23:03.041
[Nathan] All right.

23:04.210 --> 23:06.678
[ma/e newscaster]
It can
actually be harvested from
those animals with very--

23:07.850 --> 23:09.909
Well, they don't need
to be, because...

23:10.010 --> 23:12.513
They caught the bad guys
before anything bad
could happen.

23:12.620 --> 23:14.611
What if they don't catch
the next one?

23:15.420 --> 23:17.411
Uh, then...

23:20.060 --> 23:23.040
You know, your great granddad
had a bomb shelter
in the backyard.

23:23.150 --> 23:26.529
-Why?
-Because back in those days

23:26.630 --> 23:30.521
everyone thought the Russians
were gonna drop a nuclear bomb,

23:30.630 --> 23:32.609
destroy us all.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.711
But that never happened.

23:35.880 --> 23:38.815
You know what did happen?
One day I woke up and some
terrorists went and flew

23:38.920 --> 23:41.388
an airplane into the towers
of New York.

23:41.490 --> 23:45.005
9/11. I knew a few people
who died that day.

23:47.290 --> 23:49.724
Your Uncle Alex went off
to war, he died.

23:50.610 --> 23:52.612
And then, uh...

23:55.140 --> 23:57.279
You're not making me feel
any better, Daddy.

23:57.380 --> 23:58.870
It's just time that you knew

23:58.980 --> 24:01.505
that there are bad people
in the world.

24:03.830 --> 24:05.821
But I'm not gonna let
any of them to hurt you.

24:06.750 --> 24:08.741
Ever, Chloe.

24:10.030 --> 24:12.032
[knocking]

24:18.920 --> 24:20.979
What?

24:21.080 --> 24:24.288
-Who are you?
-BigDickMike1982.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.986
What? You're BigDickMike?

24:28.090 --> 24:29.660
Excuse me?

24:29.770 --> 24:32.091
-How do you know where I live.
You can't just--
-Don't touch me, Jimmy.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.479
-How do you know my name?
-I'm looking for someone.

24:35.580 --> 24:36.797
I'm the only one in here.

24:36.900 --> 24:39.494
I don't do
real life transactions.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.481
-What is that?
-It's money.

24:42.590 --> 24:44.706
It's like Bitcoin, but paper.

24:49.990 --> 24:51.992
[keyboard clacking]

24:57.200 --> 24:59.191
[cell phone vibrating]

25:02.130 --> 25:04.121
[sighs]

25:09.530 --> 25:11.521
[vibrating continues]

25:31.430 --> 25:33.648
-Hello?
-[Bob]
This is Bob Partridge.

25:33.760 --> 25:37.935
We met brieﬂy at IEP
earlier today.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.530
You must have been
pretty surpr/sed

25:39.640 --> 25:42.939
when they told you
to rep0/t there this morning.

25:43.050 --> 25:44.745
Can you talk now?

25:44.850 --> 25:46.841
Mmm-hmm.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.161
I arranged it.

25:49.570 --> 25:51.561
I also recruited Sarah Tan.

25:52.820 --> 25:55.311
I cared very deeply for her.

25:55.420 --> 25:58.309
I also removed any reference
to your relationsh/p

25:58.420 --> 26:00.411
with Sarah Tan from my file.

26:03.510 --> 26:07.082
Uh, if you knew about us, then,

26:07.190 --> 26:08.521
why did you have me come here?

26:08.630 --> 26:11.167
You could be very useful
to me right now.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.488
For everyone in that office,
this is just another job,

26:13.600 --> 26:15.977
but you are personally
interested in the truth.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.139
Joe Turner is Me a son to me.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.377
And there is no doubt
in my mind

26:19.480 --> 26:21.289
that he didn ’t do those things.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.779
I need someone
WIth your Inst/ncts

26:24.890 --> 26:26.426
searching for the truth,

26:26.530 --> 26:28.748
not just looking
to put a bullet into him.

26:28.850 --> 26:30.306
Uh...

26:30.410 --> 26:34.119
You don't even know me,
what do you know
about my instincts?

26:34.220 --> 26:35.949
It led you to Sarah.

26:36.060 --> 26:38.051
We have that in common.

26:39.180 --> 26:42.718
I need to get to Joe
before anyone else.

26:42.820 --> 26:44.526
Any advance warning
that you can give me

26:44.630 --> 26:46.086
about which way
the wind is blowing

26:46.190 --> 26:48.181
could pro ve very helpful.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.741
Can I depend on you?

26:54.560 --> 26:56.710
Do you have any idea
what's going on here?

26:58.880 --> 27:01.098
No.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.339
ButI have been doing this
for a long time.

27:03.450 --> 27:06.021
And the thing about agency ops,

27:06.130 --> 27:07.904
you can ’t always see them,

27:08.010 --> 27:11.104
but if you know what
to look for, you can see
a kind of s/lhouette

27:11.210 --> 27:14.236
made out of
the inconsistent deta/ls

27:14.340 --> 27:18.231
that; uh, covert actions
tend to leave in their wake.

27:18.340 --> 27:20.900
Do you think that
the CIA was involved in this?

27:22.020 --> 27:23.681
They may be.

27:23.790 --> 27:27.442
Or maybe they were protecting
a larger operation.

27:27.550 --> 27:29.563
I don ’t know.

27:29.670 --> 27:31.604
Well...

27:31.710 --> 27:35.692
I mean, how big would that
operation have to be to justify
doing what they did here?

27:35.800 --> 27:37.836
That's the question
that kept me up all night.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.671
And?

27:43.360 --> 27:45.362
I don't know.

27:50.730 --> 27:52.960
So what have you got
going on at school today?

27:53.570 --> 27:54.958
Nothing.

27:55.060 --> 27:57.051
Nothing?

27:57.700 --> 27:59.691
Tell them I want a refund.

28:04.310 --> 28:05.322
Hey, you wanna hear some music?

28:05.430 --> 28:08.649
Why don't we
Uptown Funk It Up?

28:08.750 --> 28:10.889
”You-” up.
-What?

28:10.990 --> 28:12.161
Forget it.

28:12.270 --> 28:14.272
[upbeat music playing
on stereo]

28:21.720 --> 28:23.256
I scared you, didn't I?

28:23.360 --> 28:25.362
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

28:27.010 --> 28:28.022
[sighs]

28:28.130 --> 28:30.963
Talking about bombs
and 9/11, and...

28:33.290 --> 28:35.292
I don't wanna make you worry.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.916
It's just sometimes
in parenting situations,

28:40.020 --> 28:43.057
I accidentally become
my father.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.456
Hi, dad.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.097
I was wondering when you were
finally gonna visit me.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.088
I was here last Friday.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.191
-Were you?
-Yeah.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.402
[sighs] I'm sorry, Alex.

29:08.970 --> 29:11.530
Memory's been failing me
these last few days.

29:12.410 --> 29:14.549
I'm Nathan.

29:14.650 --> 29:17.210
I'm your other son.
Alex died last...

29:18.900 --> 29:20.891
Seven years ago.

29:21.540 --> 29:23.599
Nathan.

29:23.700 --> 29:26.442
I was too soft on him.

29:26.550 --> 29:29.519
When he told me that
he wasn't g0ing
to West Point, I...

29:29.630 --> 29:31.120
I should've beat his ass.

29:31.230 --> 29:33.289
And you remember that?

29:33.390 --> 29:36.450
Nathan was never accepted
into West Point.

29:36.560 --> 29:39.199
Well, in least ways,
you turned out all right.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.202
[male newscaster
speaking indistinctly]

29:46.410 --> 29:48.389
You know, an interesting
thing's happened with Nathan.

29:48.490 --> 29:50.481
It's like he's done
an about face.

29:51.570 --> 29:54.084
I'm not supposed to tell you
about this, but...

29:55.050 --> 29:57.052
[sighs] It's like...

29:58.900 --> 30:02.472
He's done more for this country
than I could ever do.

30:02.580 --> 30:04.912
Do_ne more than
any ordinary soldier could.

30:05.020 --> 30:07.022
Is that what he told you?

30:09.230 --> 30:12.119
You can't trust a thing
that boy says.

30:12.230 --> 30:16.576
[newscaster]
Ammar lVazari
was stopped at ComQuest Field
before he could harm Americans.

30:16.680 --> 30:19.535
But we don ’t know
the first thing
about Ammar lVazari

30:19.640 --> 30:21.528
We don ’t know
who he was working for.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.414
We don ’t know who supplied him
with the weapons.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.511
We don ’t know
what their next target is.

30:48.310 --> 30:50.323
I can see you.

30:50.430 --> 30:52.000
I'm not doing anything.

30:52.110 --> 30:54.101
-Mmm:hmm.
-Just stretching my legs.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.533
What are you doing?

31:01.640 --> 31:02.777
I don't think you're gonna
believe me,

31:02.880 --> 31:04.871
and I have
a lot of work to do here. So...

31:06.970 --> 31:09.268
I'm sorry,

31:09.370 --> 31:13.466
ifI need some convincing that
the man who is holding me
against my will,

31:13.570 --> 31:15.060
who claims to be
a secret agent...

31:15.170 --> 31:17.479
See, I never said
I was a secret agent.

31:17.580 --> 31:20.390
I said that
I'm an analyst for the CIA.

31:20.500 --> 31:24.596
And surely you must believe
that some people
actually do work for the CIA.

31:24.700 --> 31:26.725
Well, then, isn't there
someone at the CIA
you can call?

31:26.830 --> 31:29.060
I... Thank you,
but I tried that.

31:38.360 --> 31:39.497
Who shot you?

31:39.600 --> 31:41.136
She didn't tell me her name.

31:41.240 --> 31:42.252
She?

31:42.360 --> 31:43.657
Yeah.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.376
At least the CIA's hiring
female assassins now.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.482
Do you think this is a joke?

31:50.250 --> 31:51.945
Do you?

31:52.050 --> 31:54.348
-Let me tell you
something, Joe.
-Mmm-hmm.

31:54.450 --> 31:57.157
There's no one
to whom it is more clear

31:57.260 --> 31:59.330
that this is not a joke
than me.

32:01.020 --> 32:04.148
I'm asking you questions
in the hope

32:04.260 --> 32:05.318
of believing you,

32:05.420 --> 32:07.729
so that I can feel
a little less terrified.

32:07.830 --> 32:10.583
-But I already tried to
explain this to you.
-Try again.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.431
Okay.

32:20.840 --> 32:23.331
I wrote an algorithm
that found Ammar Nazari.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.293
ComQuest Field.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.288
Then, the day after the attack,

32:26.400 --> 32:28.459
I found 12 shell companies

32:28.570 --> 32:31.300
that together bought
_ a billion dollars
in pharmaceutical stocks.

32:31.410 --> 32:36.382
They, they bought stocks
of companies that manufacture
ciprofloxacin,

32:36.490 --> 32:38.355
which is used to treat
the plague.

32:38.460 --> 32:42.510
You think someone tried
to release a plague to make
money in the stock market?

32:42.620 --> 32:45.635
I don't know. All I know
is that I found those companies

32:45.740 --> 32:47.640
and my entire office
is being killed because of it.

32:47.750 --> 32:49.741
But how do you know that's why?

32:52.110 --> 32:54.544
My friend Sam told me.

32:57.030 --> 32:59.032
He was with them.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.391
And he tried to help me...

33:01.800 --> 33:03.791
That is when this happened.

33:06.640 --> 33:10.462
Well, if you actually did
stumble onto some sort of...

33:10.570 --> 33:13.346
I, I don't know... Situation,

33:13.450 --> 33:15.338
I mean, aren't you afraid
they could be tracing
you right now?

33:15.450 --> 33:16.781
No.

33:16.890 --> 33:18.357
Why not?

33:18.460 --> 33:20.451
Because I'm very fucking good
at what I do.

33:20.780 --> 33:23.157
[keyboard clacking]

33:23.260 --> 33:27.196
This guy thinks
he's a clever boy,
but he is sloppy.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.588
Oh, he's trying to get
into this Rollands
Pharmaceutical server.

33:32.630 --> 33:34.359
Got him.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.461
Where?

33:37.110 --> 33:39.112
Tracking the IP address now.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.511
Oh, he's in Logan Circle.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.532
Wait.

33:46.640 --> 33:50.383
No, he's in Foxhall... What?

33:50.490 --> 33:53.982
What the fuck? This guy's got
every fucking computer

33:54.090 --> 33:56.399
in fucking DC
talking to each other.

33:59.900 --> 34:01.390
[Boyd] Hey.

34:01.500 --> 34:02.956
-Shepard, right?
-Yeah.

34:03.060 --> 34:05.039
How you doing? Ferris.

34:05.140 --> 34:07.916
-This your first
Task Force deet?
-Ugh, does it show?

34:08.020 --> 34:11.444
No, no, I didn't mean it
like that, I just didn't
recognize you is all.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.905
-Where'd they pull you from?
-Uh, the Bureau.

34:14.670 --> 34:16.444
You?

34:16.550 --> 34:18.575
Just part of the team...

34:18.680 --> 34:19.931
Yeah, we're all
on the same side,

34:20.040 --> 34:22.417
especially when
something like this happens.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.511
You don't fuck
with one of our own.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.716
-Shit. Let alone
eleven of them, huh?
-Yeah.

34:29.890 --> 34:31.881
You see the phone?

34:32.970 --> 34:35.586
Uh, what phone?

34:35.690 --> 34:37.863
We cracked Turner's phone.

34:37.970 --> 34:39.153
-You wanna check it out?
-Yeah.

34:39.260 --> 34:41.251
Come on.

34:43.700 --> 34:45.691
[Jimmy sighs]

34:48.140 --> 34:50.085
Do you mind? Can you...

34:50.190 --> 34:51.805
Gimme some space?

34:51.910 --> 34:53.684
Combed through
all his contacts,

34:53.790 --> 34:57.169
sent people out to shake
the trees, make sure he isn't
hiding in any of them.

34:57.270 --> 34:58.612
And how did you get his phone?

34:58.720 --> 35:01.473
Phone was_ taken from him
every morning as procedure.

35:03.880 --> 35:07.896
Yeah, but why would he turn in
his phone with the guard
he just shot?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.468
I don't know, distraction,
misdirection...

35:10.570 --> 35:12.845
Maybe let the two shooters in
then gave it to him.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.561
Hmm.

35:16.730 --> 35:18.459
Good looking guy.

35:18.570 --> 35:20.572
Yeah, he's okay.

35:22.740 --> 35:24.833
Ican, uh...

35:24.940 --> 35:29.104
I can... I can work backwards
through the FTP protocol
to track his imprint here.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.421
What the fuck?
I didn't do this.

35:34.590 --> 35:37.479
Who the fuck is this guy?

35:37.590 --> 35:40.559
Type "Did our night together
mean nothing to you?"

35:42.760 --> 35:44.751
[scoffs]

35:45.640 --> 35:47.050
Okay.

35:47.160 --> 35:49.151
Ex-boyfriend?

35:56.050 --> 35:58.325
[suspenseful music playing]

36:00.380 --> 36:04.350
"Not after you killed
everyone in my..."

36:04.460 --> 36:06.030
-Maybe I shouldn't be here.
-Don't ne silly.

36:06.140 --> 36:07.869
It's your place.

36:07.980 --> 36:09.982
Type this for me.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.791
[Kathy] Can I take my vitamins?

36:22.960 --> 36:24.689
Huh?

36:24.800 --> 36:26.859
My vitamins.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.951
They're in that basket.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.509
Can I...

36:33.610 --> 36:35.601
I got it.

36:38.810 --> 36:41.597
You know, in future
I'll probably will try to keep
a deadly weapon

36:41.700 --> 36:43.554
with my vitamins, but...

36:43.660 --> 36:45.651
I really wasn't
that prepared for this.

36:52.430 --> 36:54.421
[sighs]

36:56.310 --> 36:58.301
-What's that?
-Tinder.

36:59.110 --> 37:01.112
What's Tinder?

37:01.480 --> 37:02.811
Dating app.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.456
What? Oh, oh,

37:04.560 --> 37:06.573
-I'm married, see?
-[chuckles] Mmm.

37:06.680 --> 37:09.433
-If I had time,
I'd find your profile.
-Yeah, no you wouldn't.

37:11.690 --> 37:13.464
So, what, you think, uh...

37:13.570 --> 37:15.879
He met someone on there
and now he's holed up
with her someplace?

37:16.770 --> 37:18.146
Probably a long shot, no?

37:18.250 --> 37:20.252
You got a shorter one?

37:24.220 --> 37:26.757
Okay. Sunday night,

37:26.860 --> 37:29.112
he had a date with Kathy H.

37:29.220 --> 37:30.847
’54re we 5177/ on for 10:00?”

37:30.950 --> 37:33.885
’54re you late
or standing me up?”

37:33.990 --> 37:36.879
And he finally responded
at 10:08.

37:36.990 --> 37:40.630
"Sorry, running late,
be there by 10:30,
unless you wanna cancel."

37:41.320 --> 37:43.311
Uh, "I'll wait."

37:44.240 --> 37:48.131
And then, the next day
Kathy H, wrote,

37:48.240 --> 37:49.855
"Thank you
for walking me home."

37:49.960 --> 37:52.326
Hey. Looks like
he turned it around, huh?

37:52.930 --> 37:54.067
No.

37:54.170 --> 37:56.161
He knows where she lives.

37:56.570 --> 37:57.901
Yeah.

37:58.010 --> 38:01.537
Hoyle, is there a Kathy H.
in Turner's contacts?

38:03.140 --> 38:05.677
Uh, negative. We do not
have her listed. Who is she?

38:05.780 --> 38:08.271
They went on a date
Sunday night.
Turner walked her home.

38:08.380 --> 38:11.725
Right. Which means he knows
where she lives, right?

38:11.830 --> 38:15.368
What's the protocol for getting
a company like Tinder to
give us their data on a user?

38:15.470 --> 38:17.279
[Hoyle] I'm on it.

38:17.390 --> 38:19.381
[keyboard clacking]

38:30.840 --> 38:31.909
You know,
despite of everything,

38:32.010 --> 38:34.001
part of me really
does wanna believe you.

38:36.210 --> 38:38.019
Thank you.

38:38.130 --> 38:41.816
I find myself thinking,
under different circumstances,
you and I...

38:44.940 --> 38:46.931
I would have liked you.

38:50.780 --> 38:52.680
[chuckles]

38:52.790 --> 38:55.145
I must really
be messed up, huh?

38:58.190 --> 39:00.181
No, I would have liked you too.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.591
-Hey!
-Oh-ho. Relax.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.202
I'm not trying to escape.

39:15.650 --> 39:17.641
I'm not the type.

39:19.970 --> 39:21.870
Though, ifI was,

39:21.980 --> 39:25.336
I would have gotten out
of at least one shitty
relationship a lot sooner.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.759
Kathryn Hale is a lavwer from
Westfield &amp; Porter.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.883
She didn't show up
for work today!
And she didn't call in sick.

39:33.990 --> 39:36.766
I got her! Katheryn Hale,
3105, P-Street, Northwest.

39:36.870 --> 39:39.168
[Boyd] Get outta here.
Let's go catch a bad guy.

39:39.270 --> 39:41.079
I know it's asking a lot
for you to step aside

39:41.190 --> 39:44.375
and let Marty Frost
handle this investigation.

39:44.480 --> 39:47.734
You know, Reuel, uh,
Marty and I--

39:47.840 --> 39:50.729
Oh, I know all about
you and Marty,
and I'm sure right now

39:50.840 --> 39:54.082
you think that I've set
your worst enemy
loose against you.

39:55.010 --> 39:56.784
But the simple truth is,

39:56.890 --> 39:58.664
we didn't have
a lot of choices,

39:58.770 --> 40:00.761
and she is the right man
for the job.

40:04.700 --> 40:06.691
[agent 1] True that.

40:07.260 --> 40:08.989
[indistinct chattering]

40:09.100 --> 40:11.694
-[agent 2] Detective,
they love you though.
-[agent 3] Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

40:13.310 --> 40:15.801
You didn't think I was
gomg to let you oversee
an investigation

40:15.910 --> 40:17.684
that might implicate
your own protege.

40:17.790 --> 40:20.202
I'll give you the benefit
of the doubt that you know
what you're doing.

40:20.310 --> 40:21.766
Well, good, and I'll do
the same for you

40:21.870 --> 40:25.852
as long as you promise
to stay away from
Marty's investigation

40:25.960 --> 40:28.133
and keep your eye on the prize.

40:28.240 --> 40:29.776
There is a plague out there.

40:29.880 --> 40:32.019
And I'm not talking about
locusts or liberalism,

40:32.120 --> 40:34.122
I mean an actual plague.

40:35.050 --> 40:37.041
Now, before you go,

40:37.890 --> 40:39.869
I do need to mention

40:39.970 --> 40:44.031
we're going to have to
deal with the fallout
from your surveillance program.

40:44.140 --> 40:46.711
Now, I know at some point,
we are both going
to have to speak

40:46.820 --> 40:48.879
to the Senate's
Select Committee.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.754
And I think it's very important

40:50.860 --> 40:53.840
that we keep
our stories straight. So...

40:53.950 --> 40:55.941
[indistinct chattering]

41:02.880 --> 41:04.814
[Marty] All right,
everyone, listen up.

41:04.920 --> 41:07.218
Let's use extreme caution
out there today,

41:07.320 --> 41:11.051
in all likelihood, Turner
has already killed 12
of our own.

41:11.160 --> 41:13.742
I do not want
to add to that number.

41:13.850 --> 41:15.841

with this guy,
you pull his plug.
