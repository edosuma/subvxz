00:00.973 --> 00:03.243
- Last time on Star...
- Alex Crane's performing.

00:03.268 --> 00:04.858
Have her make her solo a duet.

00:04.883 --> 00:07.007
My husband was deported
from the only country

00:07.023 --> 00:08.907
that he's ever known, and I want action.

00:08.932 --> 00:10.433
So Atlanta can be a sanctuary city.

00:10.457 --> 00:12.726
Your performance caused
your back to spasm,

00:12.751 --> 00:15.992
- but these pain killers will take care of that.
- Doc, I told you,

00:16.017 --> 00:18.752
- I'm still in recovery.
- I'll leave these in case the spasms get worse.

00:18.776 --> 00:20.572
I got a little money
that needs some cleaning.

00:20.589 --> 00:22.594
We got unfinished business, ex-partner.

00:22.619 --> 00:24.735
But now I see you got
Xander's goons all up in here.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.278
- It's four months till my trial.
- What's up, Prison Barbie?

00:27.303 --> 00:29.052
I'm not sharing the
performance with her.

00:29.077 --> 00:30.444
Look, there is a lot at stake,

00:30.446 --> 00:32.531
with the ASA nominations on the line.

01:00.558 --> 01:01.890
Mm?

01:03.754 --> 01:05.695
You been taking charge.

01:05.756 --> 01:07.529
That's 'cause for the
first time in my life,

01:07.554 --> 01:09.235
I actually feel like I'm in charge.

01:09.260 --> 01:12.095
Now that bill got passed
and Atlanta's a safe city,

01:12.120 --> 01:14.154
I don't have to worry about losing you.

01:14.156 --> 01:15.747
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

01:19.298 --> 01:22.275
But I do have to go.

01:22.300 --> 01:25.127
I promised Noah that I'd watch
the baby for a couple hours.

01:25.151 --> 01:28.001
- I'll come with you.
- That'd be really helpful.

01:28.003 --> 01:29.670
'Cause Maurice wants to
see me, because he's trying

01:29.672 --> 01:31.505
to push an ASA nomination.

01:31.507 --> 01:34.617
- No way.
- They submitted us for "Best Pop Album."

01:35.976 --> 01:37.511
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:37.513 --> 01:39.622
- The condom broke.
- Are you kidding me?

01:39.782 --> 01:41.849
Yeah, come see this.

01:46.021 --> 01:48.464
Tell me that crazy stalker
bitch writing you from jail?

01:48.624 --> 01:52.283
No, it's not Olivia. It's my mom.

01:52.308 --> 01:54.788
She's been sober for a year
and wants to ask my forgiveness.

01:54.813 --> 01:55.898
She couldn't call you?

01:55.923 --> 01:57.194
No, she said this is easier.

01:57.219 --> 01:58.659
For her, obviously.

01:58.684 --> 02:01.960
It's always about her, and I'm over it.

02:01.985 --> 02:04.272
So what are you gonna do?

02:04.297 --> 02:07.541
What I've been trying to do
since I was 16. Ignore her ass.

02:07.543 --> 02:10.134
- That's your mom.
- She's toxic.

02:10.154 --> 02:12.483
- Alex.
- Yes?

02:12.508 --> 02:14.472
Why is Miss GiGi Nixon
on her live podcast

02:14.492 --> 02:16.327
talking trash about
you, wearing you out?

02:16.351 --> 02:18.309
And she playing your single.

02:18.329 --> 02:20.498
Why does that sound like unwashed ass?

02:21.666 --> 02:23.997
I'm talking about mildew, mothballs,

02:24.022 --> 02:25.817
ain't seen water in five years.

02:25.836 --> 02:27.326
I ain't gonna let her through!

02:27.350 --> 02:29.067
No, no, no, no, I ain't gonna go there.

02:29.092 --> 02:30.359
I ain't gonna go there. You know why?

02:30.383 --> 02:31.998
We're live. We're live.

02:32.023 --> 02:34.011
I'm not gonna say
something I can't take back.

02:34.035 --> 02:36.099
- I ain't gonna go there.
- Go there, bitch.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.926
This ain't SuperSoul Sunday.

02:37.951 --> 02:40.231
- What is this?
- You got ASA nominations in two days,

02:40.256 --> 02:42.028
and everybody's saying
that this new ho...

02:42.053 --> 02:43.599
Old wrinkle-ass Auntie.

02:43.615 --> 02:44.948
If this was someone that I didn't know,

02:44.950 --> 02:47.559
I would say to myself,
here's a young girl

02:47.584 --> 02:49.760
that's just trying to catch her a break.

02:49.785 --> 02:52.804
But the reality is, she only got hers

02:52.829 --> 02:55.250
because she's Roland Crane's daughter.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.529
- Is she serious?
- I had a taste of him once.

02:57.554 --> 02:59.179
- Ugh...
- In the bathroom,

02:59.204 --> 03:01.891
- back when I was an artist.
- Yo lying ass, you ain't never

03:01.916 --> 03:03.474
had a taste of nothing but failure.

03:03.499 --> 03:05.833
I'll put a taste of my foot
up your ass, how about that?

03:05.858 --> 03:07.398
- I got a foot for your ass.
- Are Frick and Frack done?

03:07.422 --> 03:10.663
'Cause I am. Look. The fact is,

03:10.679 --> 03:13.754
this music sounds like
Alex Crane herself...

03:13.779 --> 03:16.326
fake, boring trash.

03:16.351 --> 03:18.443
And Alex, baby, if you're listening,

03:18.468 --> 03:20.021
- which I hope you are...
- This bitch...

03:20.045 --> 03:22.838
- Uh, she is out of control.
- You're a conversation...

03:22.857 --> 03:26.100
but I am an entire press conference.

03:26.125 --> 03:28.010
And don't you ever forget it!

03:28.029 --> 03:29.875
You know, she's one to
talk, with her reality show

03:29.899 --> 03:31.198
one-hit wonder ass.

03:31.223 --> 03:32.868
She's clearly trying to
get in the voters' heads

03:32.892 --> 03:34.052
for the ASA nominations.

03:34.077 --> 03:36.018
Girl, those nominations are in two days.

03:36.037 --> 03:37.537
And you better clap back fast.

03:37.613 --> 03:39.734
You can't not respond.
That'd damage your career.

03:39.759 --> 03:41.976
You see how 50 slayed Ja
Rule's ass and got him chopped.

03:42.001 --> 03:43.445
Bruce, no. No, Alex.

03:43.470 --> 03:45.213
We are not about to feed into the bait.

03:45.237 --> 03:47.024
Okay? Rise above all that, okay?

03:47.048 --> 03:48.318
- That's not...
- No, no, all right, look.

03:48.342 --> 03:49.694
You are not Michelle Obama.

03:49.719 --> 03:51.018
You can go low.

03:51.043 --> 03:53.869
Ain't nobody scared
of no damn GiGi Nixon.

03:53.947 --> 03:56.097
Slay her! Drag that bitch!

04:19.488 --> 04:22.800
So your new album,
Sober, dropped last week.

04:22.825 --> 04:25.167
- Yeah, yeah.
- Getting a little hot out in these streets...

04:25.191 --> 04:26.556
Oh, yeah, uh-huh...

04:26.581 --> 04:28.237
Tell me a little bit about the title.

04:28.256 --> 04:30.739
Sober. It's no secret. Everybody knows

04:30.764 --> 04:32.461
- I've-I've had my share of struggle.
- Mm-hmm.

04:32.485 --> 04:34.951
- Um, but I'm in a good place now.
- Right.

04:34.976 --> 04:36.296
And you can hear that in the music.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.981
A big part of that positivity
has to be your new son

04:39.006 --> 04:40.606
with Star Davis of Take 3.

04:40.631 --> 04:41.999
- Congrats.
- Yeah, thank you. Thank you.

04:42.023 --> 04:44.771
- That's, that's my little man. Yeah.
- All right.

04:44.796 --> 04:46.085
It's got to be a little tough, though,

04:46.109 --> 04:47.925
with his mom being in-in jail.

04:47.950 --> 04:50.561
- Can you talk more about that part?
- Well, she's innocent.

04:50.586 --> 04:53.429
Right? And, uh, that'll
be proven in due course.

04:53.454 --> 04:54.954
But for now I'm handling my business

04:54.979 --> 04:57.871
- and trying to be a good dad.
- Okay, good dad.

04:57.896 --> 04:59.733
Well, listen, the ASA nominations

04:59.758 --> 05:01.185
are about two days away.

05:01.210 --> 05:03.677
- Ooh...
- Rumor has it you and Star could be nominated

05:03.702 --> 05:05.259
in the same category.

05:05.284 --> 05:06.435
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

05:06.459 --> 05:09.162
You know Star's "There for You" was like out of here.

05:09.186 --> 05:11.698
- Yeah, it's blazing, I know, I know.
- So...

05:11.722 --> 05:14.263
- a little family beef, competition?
- Oh, man, no-no-no, no-no-no-no.

05:14.287 --> 05:16.300
- You know, nobody wins when a family feuds.
- Mmm.

05:16.302 --> 05:20.373
If Star wins, Davis wins.
And that makes me happy.

05:20.398 --> 05:21.741
- Okay, I like that, I like...
- Yeah.

05:21.765 --> 05:24.475
She's giving me the "wrap it" sign.

05:24.477 --> 05:27.409
- Got to go. Anyway... congrats, bruh.
- Yo. Yo, man.

05:27.434 --> 05:29.450
- We got to get out of these streets.
- Hey, no, you know we do.

05:29.474 --> 05:31.758
I will.

05:31.783 --> 05:33.583
- Already.
- What's up, man?

05:33.608 --> 05:35.901
You good, baby?

05:35.926 --> 05:38.285
You good? Yeah, you good.

05:39.241 --> 05:41.224
Mmm.

05:41.249 --> 05:43.207
One of these...

05:46.961 --> 05:49.086
- What's up?
- What are those?

05:49.105 --> 05:51.139
It's Oxy for my back.

05:51.164 --> 05:52.951
Come on, now, it's just for pain,

05:52.976 --> 05:54.826
not partying, and this is my last batch.

05:54.851 --> 05:56.462
I feel so much better. Don't trip.

05:56.486 --> 05:59.129
I just hope you don't
get dependent on those.

05:59.154 --> 06:00.662
I know what that's like.

06:00.687 --> 06:03.513
- And now Davis comes first.
- Man, I know.

06:03.538 --> 06:05.575
All right? I'm not gonna
do anything to mess him up.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.979
I'm about to get on the phone with Star,

06:07.003 --> 06:08.684
and she's gonna ask me if
you're looking out for him.

06:08.708 --> 06:11.500
You can tell her the truth.
We've never been better.

06:25.732 --> 06:27.231
So what was so important?

06:27.256 --> 06:29.896
So you wanted proof that Xander's
tied into Gravity Media?

06:29.921 --> 06:32.497
Here it is, right there. Clear as day.

06:32.522 --> 06:37.019
That's his guy, Stephen,
collecting suitcases from Mateo.

06:37.044 --> 06:38.621
So Mateo's in on it.

06:38.646 --> 06:40.329
Should we go holla at him?

06:40.354 --> 06:42.405
No, because X probably threatened him.

06:42.430 --> 06:43.676
Or worse, his family.

06:43.684 --> 06:45.131
Fear is how he operates.

06:45.156 --> 06:47.014
Yeah, well, we can't have
that up in Gravity Records

06:47.038 --> 06:49.451
this close to ASAs. It'd shut us down.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.420
Yeah, which is why we
need to flip Stephen.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.405
He can lead us to a way to frame X

06:53.429 --> 06:55.697
and get him out of the picture.

06:57.148 --> 07:00.191
You know, this isn't why I
thought you called me over here.

07:02.208 --> 07:04.875
We haven't spoken since we kissed.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.507
Since we kissed?

07:06.532 --> 07:08.140
No, negro. You kissed me.

07:08.537 --> 07:10.253
You didn't like it?

07:12.916 --> 07:14.316
Look, I already told you

07:14.343 --> 07:16.818
I do not ride my
sister's previous horses.

07:16.845 --> 07:18.653
Okay? This is strictly business.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.566
And if you want your
precious Gravity Media

07:20.590 --> 07:21.656
to not go down in flames,

07:21.658 --> 07:23.266
we need to act fast.

07:24.353 --> 07:26.436
'Kay?

07:26.461 --> 07:27.677
But you look cute, though.

07:34.446 --> 07:36.246
Sorry I'm late.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.468
This ASA stuff got me
running around like crazy.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.320
What's this meeting about, Maurice?

07:40.344 --> 07:41.987
Well, you called it. I was
hoping you could tell me.

07:42.011 --> 07:43.485
That was me.

07:43.530 --> 07:46.531
I wanted to thank you personally...

07:46.556 --> 07:49.465
...for reviewing my music.

07:49.490 --> 07:53.193
Oh, and say hi to my
fans. You're live, baby.

07:53.218 --> 07:55.261
Bitch, I'm live every day of the week.

07:55.286 --> 07:57.277
I want to throw a
silent listening party.

07:57.302 --> 07:58.378
Tomorrow night.

07:58.403 --> 08:00.122
GiGi Nixon versus Alex Crane.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.631
Three tracks each.

08:01.647 --> 08:02.963
Houston Connelly from Billboard

08:02.991 --> 08:04.835
has agreed to come down
and take a little listen.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.941
Yo, Houston predicts who's
nominated for ASAs every year.

08:07.966 --> 08:10.766
Exactly. She's agreed to
write a review about our music.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.306
I'm good, love.

08:12.308 --> 08:14.761
I'd slay any damn listening party.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.021
Uh-uh. GiGi ain't scared
of you, Meghan Darkle.

08:17.046 --> 08:18.889
See, I get it. You feeling real tough

08:18.914 --> 08:21.836
'cause your little viewers
is watching. Hey, y'all.

08:21.861 --> 08:25.711
When it's clear you don't know
a damn thing about GiGi Nixon.

08:25.736 --> 08:28.681
So listen closely and get
some oxygen in your lungs,

08:28.706 --> 08:30.431
'cause I'm about to bury your ass

08:30.456 --> 08:31.657
and win this thing.

08:31.682 --> 08:34.048
Let's go.

08:34.073 --> 08:36.783
Being in here without
Davis is killing me, Simone.

08:36.808 --> 08:37.990
He's being looked after,

08:38.015 --> 08:39.611
and he's getting all
the love that he needs.

08:39.635 --> 08:40.989
Look, I've been to juvie and jail.

08:41.013 --> 08:42.414
I can do this in my sleep.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.580
This is different.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.151
I got put in the hole today.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.669
Why?

08:49.694 --> 08:51.085
It don't matter. It don't matter.

08:51.110 --> 08:52.899
I just got to get through
this and get back to Davis.

08:52.923 --> 08:53.993
They moved my trial date,

08:54.018 --> 08:55.627
and they're giving my
attorney the runaround.

08:55.651 --> 08:58.243
I'm just gonna
be in here forever, Simone.

08:58.268 --> 09:01.049
Just-just stay stronger... for me,

09:01.074 --> 09:03.074
just for a little bit.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.660
Why don't you sing with me?

09:06.685 --> 09:08.434
Simone, I'm not about to sing with you.

09:08.459 --> 09:10.542
I got bitches breathing down my back.

09:10.567 --> 09:17.104

09:55.040 --> 09:56.706
I love you, too.

10:01.407 --> 10:02.739
Look, we got to do something.

10:02.741 --> 10:05.617
Okay? Star's falling apart in jail.

10:05.642 --> 10:07.120
Why is nothing happening to her case?

10:07.144 --> 10:08.268
I don't understand.

10:08.287 --> 10:09.528
Because of Charlene.

10:09.553 --> 10:11.198
You know, she's
obviously up to something.

10:11.223 --> 10:12.624
She was the one who baited Star.

10:12.649 --> 10:14.311
She admitted that she killed Brody.

10:14.335 --> 10:15.751
And now she wants Star to suffer

10:15.776 --> 10:17.397
because Hunter and Arlene are dead.

10:18.131 --> 10:20.297
Well, look, I wasn't gonna say nothing

10:20.322 --> 10:21.548
until we had concrete evidence,

10:21.572 --> 10:23.634
but something about that girl case

10:23.659 --> 10:25.475
is fishier than Cotton's pantyhose.

10:25.529 --> 10:28.364
Bitch, you know my goodies stay fresh.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.418
- Bitch, where?
- And now is not the time for that, girl.

10:30.442 --> 10:31.700
Give them the tea.

10:31.702 --> 10:33.979
I know for a fact that
judge got a dirty rap sheet.

10:34.004 --> 10:35.615
I just can't prove it
right now, but, baby,

10:35.639 --> 10:37.222
I got my ear to the street.

10:37.372 --> 10:39.514
And I'm watching that Charlene ass.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.726
But you know Star can't
handle this much longer.

10:41.751 --> 10:44.124
Look, I got this, a'ight?
Let me check my contacts.

10:44.148 --> 10:45.675
Y'all focus on what y'all need

10:45.700 --> 10:47.419
to for these ASA nominations, okay?

10:47.443 --> 10:49.546
Maybe once Star get out,
she'll have some good news.

10:49.570 --> 10:51.375
Okay, well, I got to go, 'cause
Maurice wants me to meet him

10:51.399 --> 10:53.464
- at the label.
- And I got to pick out three tracks

10:53.488 --> 10:54.904
to kick GiGi's ass, so...

10:54.929 --> 10:57.217
Ooh, can you pick out four
tracks to kick her ass?

10:57.242 --> 10:59.263
Mm-hmm.

10:59.288 --> 11:01.079
No.

11:01.174 --> 11:02.898
Is that your mom?

11:02.900 --> 11:05.100
Yeah, I'll tell you
more about it in the car.

11:09.873 --> 11:11.089
And that's my ball.

11:11.208 --> 11:12.518
- Well, I'm sorry.
- Guys.

11:12.542 --> 11:14.259
All right, y'all.

11:14.284 --> 11:15.670
This is Irv Riddick.

11:15.695 --> 11:18.021
I know who Irv Riddick is.
He's on the panel for the ASAs.

11:18.046 --> 11:20.289
Well, this is his
soon-to-be fourth wife, Crystal,

11:20.313 --> 11:23.212
and she wants everybody in the
A to know she secured the bag.

11:23.237 --> 11:25.740
Now, tomorrow, she's
having a bachelorette party,

11:25.765 --> 11:28.367
and Irv is spending
some major cash on it.

11:28.392 --> 11:30.609
- They want y'all to perform.
- Me?

11:30.727 --> 11:32.538
I said they want y'all to perform.

11:32.562 --> 11:34.340
Together. Now, listen,

11:34.365 --> 11:36.480
by y'all doing this last-minute favor,

11:36.505 --> 11:38.100
it could change the game for y'all.

11:38.102 --> 11:40.741
With Irv on the panel for the ASAs,

11:40.766 --> 11:43.194
this could be the final push
y'all need for the nomination.

11:43.219 --> 11:45.274
Now, Noah, are you up
for it with your back?

11:45.276 --> 11:47.220
- 'Cause I need you to show the hell up.
- Come on, man.

11:47.244 --> 11:49.945
I need people to have a
little bit more faith in me.

11:49.947 --> 11:52.264
You know what to do, then.

12:01.183 --> 12:03.976
Y'all look cute together.

12:04.070 --> 12:06.820
I could see this for us.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.897
Sure, someday.

12:10.922 --> 12:13.488
Well, you know, it wasn't that long ago

12:13.513 --> 12:15.206
we were planning this for ourselves.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.202
Wanted to be like Bonnie
and Clyde and run away,

12:17.227 --> 12:21.643
start a family, live that simple life.

12:21.645 --> 12:24.070
Yeah, well, you know
how that story ends.

12:24.131 --> 12:26.072
Plus, we're together now.

12:26.092 --> 12:28.575
You know, we're not
running away from anything.

12:28.594 --> 12:30.669
Okay, well, I'm a dreamer. Can I dream?

12:30.787 --> 12:32.407
Simone, it was hell
for me to get back here

12:32.431 --> 12:33.989
to America to save this marriage.

12:33.991 --> 12:36.132
Made me re-evaluate what I
really want in this life,

12:36.157 --> 12:37.436
and I know what I want now.

12:37.461 --> 12:39.436
My sister's in jail.

12:39.817 --> 12:41.378
I'm trying to take care of her baby.

12:41.403 --> 12:43.607
This is a lot to process right now.

12:43.684 --> 12:46.685
Yeah. I won't... I'm not
trying to stress you out.

12:50.974 --> 12:52.283
Hey.

12:52.578 --> 12:54.920
Hey, uh, yeah, I'll be right there.

12:54.945 --> 12:56.787
Okay, bye, Alex.

12:56.905 --> 13:02.351
I got to go do this appearance
thing with Alex, but, um,

14:34.879 --> 14:37.195
That party was crazy last night.

14:37.272 --> 14:40.233
Yep, especially when
GiGi tried to make out with me.

14:40.258 --> 14:42.953
As if that wasn't
enough, when I woke up,

14:42.978 --> 14:44.790
I got ten missed calls from my mom.

14:44.814 --> 14:47.865
- And?
- I thought about what you said last night,

14:47.983 --> 14:50.534
- so I called her back.
- And what'd you say?

14:50.611 --> 14:53.037
That turning a new leaf
doesn't erase the past.

14:53.131 --> 14:55.887

to put her in a car

14:55.912 --> 14:57.178
'cause she couldn't stand up,

14:57.203 --> 14:58.918
while the paparazzi
were taking pictures,

14:58.943 --> 15:00.481
just doesn't go away.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.841
Or finding her in the
bed with my boyfriend.

15:02.866 --> 15:04.260
Let's not forget that.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.231
- Yeah...
- That doesn't just vanish

15:06.256 --> 15:08.489
because she's better.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.767
She's never even said "I'm sorry."

15:10.792 --> 15:11.991
Not once.

15:12.016 --> 15:13.832
Maybe she don't know how?

15:13.857 --> 15:15.635
- Yeah, that's what she said.
- Look, bitch,

15:15.659 --> 15:16.698
my connect just came through.

15:16.722 --> 15:19.568
I got the dirt on that
old shady-ass judge.

15:19.593 --> 15:21.276
He been meeting some old-ass white woman

15:21.301 --> 15:23.177
at the Peachtree Motel
every night this week,

15:23.202 --> 15:25.594
and it ain't his wife.

15:25.619 --> 15:27.779
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

15:27.804 --> 15:30.619
Uh-huh. Miss Charlene been
getting that ass slapped

15:30.644 --> 15:32.540
with that gavel on the weekly. Ah!

15:32.565 --> 15:36.540
Oh, okay, and now that
image is locked in my brain.

15:36.565 --> 15:37.659
Thank you.

15:37.684 --> 15:39.567
That image is nasty.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.613
What we gonna do?

15:41.633 --> 15:43.968
Well, you know I'm a
product of the system,

15:43.993 --> 15:45.640
so it could go either way.

15:45.665 --> 15:47.946
I like when you get all
foster kid ratchet on me.

15:47.971 --> 15:49.238
Thank you.

15:53.502 --> 15:55.886
All right, your X-rays are promising.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.319
Now, how's the pain been?

15:57.344 --> 15:59.122
Oh, I'm managing. You know me, Doc.

16:00.462 --> 16:03.579
I am prescribing you 800
milligrams of ibuprofen.

16:03.604 --> 16:06.125
Oh, wait, wait, we-we're
getting away from the Oxy?

16:06.150 --> 16:09.031
Well, I, I know you had some
concern given your history.

16:09.056 --> 16:10.808
I just wanted to respect that.

16:10.833 --> 16:13.011
But, Doc, it's been working,
right? I mean, I'd hate

16:13.036 --> 16:15.025
to change up what's been
working, especially right before

16:15.049 --> 16:16.957
these big performances.

16:16.982 --> 16:19.312
Look, maybe, like, one
more refill, you know?

16:19.337 --> 16:20.578
Just for a safety net?

16:20.603 --> 16:21.787
Well, if you're sure.

16:21.812 --> 16:24.071
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Well, you bet.

16:27.012 --> 16:29.220
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

16:30.631 --> 16:32.734
You know what? I should knock
you out for even thinking about

16:32.758 --> 16:34.499
hobbling your ass up in here.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.910
- What do you want?
- I-I've been calling.

16:36.987 --> 16:39.321
I've been calling and
calling, no answer.

16:39.323 --> 16:42.100
Didn't you hear me?
Something's wrong with me.

16:42.125 --> 16:44.292
- I got...
- And I don't give a damn.

16:44.312 --> 16:46.011
You can go.

16:46.129 --> 16:47.229
Bye.

16:50.818 --> 16:53.593
I'll always be your father.

16:57.858 --> 17:00.453
You shouldn't speak
to your father like that.

17:00.477 --> 17:02.286
You want to talk about it?

17:02.404 --> 17:03.770
I don't feel like it,

17:03.795 --> 17:06.753
so you can just dead the
whole Dr. Phil routine.

17:06.779 --> 17:08.386
Look, sooner or later you're
gonna have to be honest

17:08.410 --> 17:09.685
about your feelings.

17:09.686 --> 17:10.794
You only get one dad.

17:10.913 --> 17:12.288
What, you're trying to be my shoulder

17:12.311 --> 17:13.432
or something to lean on?

17:13.457 --> 17:15.299
Talk to him.

17:15.459 --> 17:19.118
Look, what I do want to talk
about is taking Xander out.

17:19.137 --> 17:20.863
The best way to catch
a snake is with a rat.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.701
So we got to get Stephen's ass fast.

17:22.724 --> 17:24.958
Mm, but he doesn't seem
like the snitching type.

17:24.977 --> 17:28.795
Well, this is why God
made baseball bats.

17:28.820 --> 17:30.699
Beating some dude's head in

17:30.724 --> 17:32.294
ain't gonna make your problems go away.

17:32.318 --> 17:36.879
And we're keeping Gravity's
name clean of dirt, remember?

17:36.881 --> 17:40.716
Oh, yeah? Then what's your plan?

17:40.718 --> 17:43.218
Everybody's got a negotiating point.

17:43.220 --> 17:45.979

want to listen to me.

18:29.193 --> 18:31.227

- Girl...

18:31.247 --> 18:32.804
No, you're listening to Missy,

18:32.831 --> 18:35.398

18:37.890 --> 18:40.564

18:40.589 --> 18:44.649

first recording studio, huh?

18:44.651 --> 18:48.244
Who taught you how to use your gift?

18:48.264 --> 18:50.005
Can a sister get some?

18:50.099 --> 18:53.249
- You did.
- Yeah.

18:53.269 --> 18:55.510
Now, before we pick these songs,

18:55.587 --> 18:58.680
let's get our creative juices flowing.

18:58.798 --> 19:00.332
This the good stuff.

19:00.334 --> 19:03.023
Yeah. Ha-ha.

19:03.048 --> 19:05.595
You ever think about what
the good stuff did to my mom?

19:05.656 --> 19:09.487
Girl, your mama died 'cause she
ain't never know when to stop.

19:09.512 --> 19:10.862
We ain't like that.

19:12.679 --> 19:14.329
Let's get it.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.768
Right there, right there.

19:29.196 --> 19:31.641
Hit me harder. Hit me harder!

19:31.666 --> 19:32.916
Harder, bitch.

19:32.941 --> 19:34.728
- Mamacita, bad boy.
- Come on.

19:34.753 --> 19:37.444
- Treat me like a dog. Treat me like a dog.
- Bad boy!

19:37.469 --> 19:39.374
- Mommy likes a bad boy.
- Come on!

19:39.399 --> 19:41.398
- Who is it?
- Housekeeping!

19:41.423 --> 19:43.428
We don't need any. Go away!

19:43.453 --> 19:46.570
- What?
- What you need is Jesus and a condom,

19:46.595 --> 19:48.433
with y'all nasty, perverted asses.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.716
I'm-a make this real
simple on you, Judge.

19:50.741 --> 19:52.702
You got two options. Option one:

19:52.727 --> 19:55.410
I can release this video and
you lose your job and your wife.

19:55.435 --> 19:57.058
If she got any self-respect.

19:57.083 --> 19:58.778
Think I'm playing?

19:58.802 --> 20:01.527
you can admit that this
beanbag-built bitch bribed you

20:01.529 --> 20:03.379
and let Star Davis out of jail.

20:03.404 --> 20:04.880
Or option three?

20:04.905 --> 20:06.654
You could all kiss my ass.

20:06.679 --> 20:09.547
Don't worry about them.
You can't prove a thing.

20:09.871 --> 20:12.796
You know, Star told me everything.

20:12.821 --> 20:14.508
I know you killed Brody.

20:14.533 --> 20:17.444
Your sister is a liar and a whore.

20:17.469 --> 20:21.656
Brody, he killed my sister.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.804
I know what it's like to lose family.

20:24.828 --> 20:29.132
But I'll be damned if I let you
disrupt everything in your path

20:29.157 --> 20:30.541
- to get what you want.
- Look,

20:30.565 --> 20:32.681
I don't know anything
about any murders, okay?

20:32.706 --> 20:37.306
But what I do know is that
this woman, she bribed me.

20:37.331 --> 20:40.309
- Shut the hell up!
- Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead!

20:40.334 --> 20:42.145
We got you, bitch.

20:42.170 --> 20:44.098
You better get Star out of jail.

20:44.123 --> 20:46.243
- Right away. Right away.
- Come on.

20:57.235 --> 20:59.496
You ain't gonna do nothing with that.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.937
I'm really trying to
find a reason not to.

21:02.032 --> 21:04.607
Think of all those times you
was with your mom in public.

21:04.632 --> 21:06.632
Feeling humiliated 'cause she was drunk.

21:06.657 --> 21:08.577
GiGi's situation is no different.

21:10.040 --> 21:13.783
And that's the sad irony
of this entire situation.

21:13.808 --> 21:15.166
You really want to put this out there

21:15.190 --> 21:16.519
when you know how it feels?

21:16.544 --> 21:18.548
At this point, I don't
know what else to do

21:18.572 --> 21:19.997
to have her stop coming for me.

21:20.050 --> 21:22.625
- Your music.
- And if that doesn't work, what?

21:22.650 --> 21:23.667
She wins.

21:27.891 --> 21:29.799
She don't win, Alex.

21:29.893 --> 21:30.966
Look at that video.

21:30.991 --> 21:33.358
Look at her life.

21:33.961 --> 21:35.881
Her aunt's an addict,
just like your mom.

21:35.906 --> 21:38.740
No one wins in this situation.

21:40.394 --> 21:42.695
Nobody.

21:50.566 --> 21:52.157
I don't work for Xander no more.

21:52.182 --> 21:55.216
- Yo, you lying, we saw you.
- Easy, Cassie.

21:55.241 --> 21:56.751
My man.

21:56.869 --> 21:59.587
My man, you could be doing a lot better.

21:59.612 --> 22:01.222
I saw the stickers on your truck.

22:01.247 --> 22:02.878
The last thing you want to do is end up

22:02.903 --> 22:05.111
in jail, away from your
kids. Now all you got to do

22:05.136 --> 22:07.114
is tell us what Xander's
doing for the company.

22:07.263 --> 22:10.264
I ain't no snitch, and, besides,

22:10.289 --> 22:12.826
X been as good to me as
he's been to you, bitch.

22:12.851 --> 22:14.811
Did you just call me a
bitch? I will bust your ass

22:14.836 --> 22:16.169
talking to me like that!

22:16.194 --> 22:18.399
You don't know me. You don't
know me like that, bitch.

22:18.424 --> 22:19.590
Cassie!

22:19.609 --> 22:21.466
Tell us what we want to
know right now, bitch.

22:21.486 --> 22:24.094
Look, are you done? Are you done?

22:24.119 --> 22:26.739
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- Now, you know I ain't with this gangster mess.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.432
If this is about your
dad, deal with him.

22:28.451 --> 22:29.859
Yeah.

22:29.884 --> 22:32.101
If any of this get back to X,

22:32.126 --> 22:35.344
I'm-a be back to Kunta
Kinte that ass, you got that?

22:35.369 --> 22:38.346
We out this bitch, Maurice.

23:21.250 --> 23:22.993
Uh-oh.

23:23.018 --> 23:24.890
- Welcome, welcome, welcome.
- Hello.

23:24.915 --> 23:26.806
- What's up, Irv?
- Welcome, welcome.

23:26.808 --> 23:28.641
- I'm Simone.
- What's up? Nice to meet you.

23:28.643 --> 23:29.922
- Nice to meet you.
- It's my pleasure.

23:29.946 --> 23:31.828
Welcome to the palace.

23:31.904 --> 23:34.423
Man, I, uh... I'm kind of surprised

23:34.448 --> 23:37.166
that you're at your
fiancée's bachelorette party.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.230
I mean, it's like that
sometimes, you know?

23:39.255 --> 23:41.349
Yeah.

23:41.374 --> 23:42.835
He doesn't trust my ass with you,

23:42.860 --> 23:45.268
- and, uh, neither do I.
- I mean, you could look,

23:45.293 --> 23:47.271
but you just can't touch, baby thug,

23:47.295 --> 23:49.073
- you feel me?
- I was really moved

23:49.097 --> 23:51.606
by what you did to make
the A a sanctuary city.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.620
I just speak out for what I believe in.

23:53.645 --> 23:55.560
And I respect you for that, too,

23:55.636 --> 23:58.717
so I plan on keeping my eyes
on you, Miss Simone Davis.

23:58.742 --> 24:00.195
Maybe next year you may score

24:00.220 --> 24:03.804
your own nominations, possibly
as a solo artist and...

24:03.829 --> 24:07.605
of course, do it like a boss.

24:09.668 --> 24:10.978
Hi, love.

24:11.002 --> 24:13.611
I got your video. Blackmailing me?

24:13.672 --> 24:15.607
GiGi, we may be very different,

24:15.632 --> 24:17.276
but we both have addicts in our family

24:17.300 --> 24:18.782
and I know how ugly that is.

24:18.844 --> 24:20.710
That's why I'm not posting this.

24:20.735 --> 24:22.568
What do you want? A thank you?

24:22.593 --> 24:24.242
I want you to back off.

24:24.474 --> 24:26.883
From now on, it's about
the music and nothing else

24:26.908 --> 24:28.265
'cause if you push me again,

24:28.353 --> 24:31.187
the world is gonna
see who you really are.

24:37.845 --> 24:40.229
- The hell was that?
- Nothing.

24:40.348 --> 24:41.948
Let me see.

- Bruce just called.
- What'd she say?

26:46.738 --> 26:48.629
She said Star's getting out of jail.

26:48.631 --> 26:50.696
- Wait, what-what, when?
- We got dirt on that judge.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.743
I didn't know it would work,

26:51.767 --> 26:53.954
and then, by this time tomorrow,
she gonna be with Davis.

26:53.978 --> 26:55.914

Bruce, Cott, and I took down
that judge. Now I just got to

27:24.015 --> 27:26.619
figure out a way to get back at
that nasty-ass bitch Charlene.

27:26.644 --> 27:28.422
You should've seen the way
that she smacked that ass.

27:28.446 --> 27:29.645
It was disgraceful.

27:29.664 --> 27:31.146
I don't want to see that.

27:31.166 --> 27:32.648
Alex, there you are.

27:32.709 --> 27:35.560
Houston. Thanks so much for coming.

27:35.562 --> 27:36.985
I really appreciate it.

27:37.010 --> 27:39.209
Alex, I can't wait to
hear your new tracks.

27:39.234 --> 27:41.475
It's a bold move to take on GiGi Nixon.

27:41.500 --> 27:42.758
Yeah, I just want respect

27:42.783 --> 27:45.117
and a chance to show people
that my music is enough,

27:45.142 --> 27:47.304
- 'cause it is.
- All right, Atlanta.

27:47.329 --> 27:50.580
We got GiGi Nixon taking
on Alex Crane tonight.

27:50.605 --> 27:52.996
Now, if you're listening to Alex,

27:53.021 --> 27:54.368
your color's gonna be pink.

27:54.393 --> 27:55.746
If you're Team GiGi,

27:55.748 --> 27:57.765
your color's gonna be blue.

27:57.883 --> 28:00.161
Got it? Good. Put your headphones on

28:00.186 --> 28:02.195
in five... four...

28:02.220 --> 28:04.437
three... two...

28:04.462 --> 28:09.240
one. Let's go!

28:20.215 --> 28:22.773
Yo. Yo.

28:22.801 --> 28:25.033
GiGi, we got a problem.

28:25.053 --> 28:27.220
You know that video
of y'all getting high?

28:27.245 --> 28:29.285
Yeah. It's all over the damn Internet.

28:31.175 --> 28:32.787
That bougie-ass slut Alex.

28:32.811 --> 28:36.229
No. This is your fault.

28:36.254 --> 28:38.120
You pushed me into this rivalry,

28:38.145 --> 28:39.595
and you pushed me into those drugs.

28:39.620 --> 28:41.373
- Oh, we'll fix this.
- Oh, no, I'll fix it.

28:41.398 --> 28:42.949
You've done enough for me. I'm done.

28:42.974 --> 28:44.028
What you mean you done?

28:44.053 --> 28:45.601
I mean I should've dumped your ass

28:45.626 --> 28:47.062
when I got my recording contract,

28:47.087 --> 28:49.479
- just like the label suggested.
- I gave up my career

28:49.504 --> 28:51.153
- so that you could have yours.
- No!

28:51.178 --> 28:53.164
Drugs and alcohol ruined your career,

28:53.189 --> 28:56.615
and then you had the nerve to
push me into your same vices.

28:56.809 --> 28:59.151
Giving me weed at only 12 years old?

28:59.176 --> 29:01.343
- I know you hurt...
- No, I'm not hurt.

29:01.368 --> 29:04.385
I'm just seeing things
as they've always been.

29:04.575 --> 29:07.593
And you know what? I'm through with it.

29:07.712 --> 29:09.690
So why don't you walk
your ass up out of here,

29:09.714 --> 29:11.358
'cause I don't even
want to see you no more.

29:11.382 --> 29:13.491
GiGi, don't do this.

29:13.493 --> 29:15.342
You...

29:15.367 --> 29:17.176
the music...

29:17.201 --> 29:18.500
- You're all I got.
- Stop it!

29:18.524 --> 29:21.192
Get the hell out here
before I call security!

29:21.217 --> 29:23.884
- Get the hell out!
- You're all I got!

29:23.909 --> 29:25.778
Get the hell out before
I call the security!

29:25.803 --> 29:27.395
Get out!

29:35.039 --> 29:36.681
So you're just gonna hide back here

29:36.683 --> 29:38.144
all night and not enjoy the party?

29:38.168 --> 29:39.812
You know what? I was
sitting here, thinking

29:39.836 --> 29:41.421
that we not after the same thing.

29:41.445 --> 29:43.645
I mean, you want Xander
to stay out of the way

29:43.673 --> 29:45.873
and I want to get rid
of his ass for good.

29:45.967 --> 29:48.042
No, I was trying to look out.

29:48.136 --> 29:50.377
Maurice, look...

29:50.402 --> 29:53.569
I'm a lioness, ain't no controlling me.

29:53.716 --> 29:56.717
Anybody that tries will
get their ass mauled.

29:56.811 --> 29:58.122
Well, they say when animals attack,

29:58.146 --> 29:59.537
it's usually out of fear.

29:59.539 --> 30:01.772
And we know I ain't afraid of nothing.

30:03.818 --> 30:09.230
You know, you and I
are more similar than you think.

30:09.348 --> 30:12.399
Boy, please. You're just talking
out the side of your neck.

30:12.518 --> 30:13.843
I'm serious.

30:13.870 --> 30:15.848
We're both hustlers
that grew up in the hood

30:15.872 --> 30:18.498
with toxic relationships
with our parents.

30:18.574 --> 30:20.908
Except my daddy issues are on steroids.

30:20.933 --> 30:22.628
Well, that's no different than my mom,

30:22.653 --> 30:24.799
who hates me because I
reminded her of my pops.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.150
Damn, that's...

30:26.175 --> 30:29.900
that's messed up,
especially with your...

30:29.902 --> 30:31.867
fine, chocolate sexy ass.

30:33.573 --> 30:36.517
Yeah, well, with all the
evil stuff that was said

30:36.542 --> 30:37.925
and done to me growing up,

30:38.043 --> 30:41.412
I never saw it that way.

30:41.414 --> 30:44.023
When's the last time
you talked to your mom?

30:44.141 --> 30:47.752
This morning,

30:47.754 --> 30:50.696
because I was able to deal
with it and get past it.

30:56.130 --> 30:58.464
You know what? Finish your drink,

30:58.489 --> 31:01.541
- come out and party with us.
- Okay.

31:09.408 --> 31:11.776
Hello.

31:11.778 --> 31:15.370
Damn, Daddy fell again?

31:15.448 --> 31:16.705
Hospital?

31:16.724 --> 31:18.516
It's that bad?

31:22.288 --> 31:23.621
- Alex.
- Hi.

31:23.623 --> 31:26.140
I have another event to
get to, but I wanted to say

31:26.165 --> 31:27.959
you took the high road and it worked.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.738
There's no denying your artistry.

31:29.762 --> 31:31.740
There'll be an article
printed before midnight.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.480
I hope it helps with the ASAs.

31:33.599 --> 31:35.816
Thank you, Houston.

31:35.934 --> 31:37.968
I told you to go high.

31:37.970 --> 31:39.548
- Y'all...
- Hey.

31:39.572 --> 31:41.550
There's a video of GiGi
and her aunt doing drugs

31:41.574 --> 31:42.656
that's going viral.

31:42.681 --> 31:44.806
It's bad.

31:44.831 --> 31:46.577
Alex, please tell me you
didn't put this video out.

31:46.601 --> 31:48.501
No, no, I didn't do this.

31:48.526 --> 31:50.784
I don't know how this happened.

31:50.967 --> 31:54.093
GiGi. GiGi!

31:54.211 --> 31:56.762
How in the hell did you let this
happen? You know it's gonna be

31:56.787 --> 31:58.337
a PR nightmare.

31:58.362 --> 32:00.788
Welcome to my life.

34:54.206 --> 34:55.909
No, no!

No...

34:57.770 --> 34:59.837
Somebody get help!

34:59.839 --> 35:01.906
No...

35:06.111 --> 35:08.270
No!

35:08.289 --> 35:10.438
I'm sorry, Auntie.

35:10.458 --> 35:13.000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:17.004 --> 35:19.778
We'll be revealing the ASA nominees

35:19.803 --> 35:24.060
in the general field categories
in just a few moments.

35:24.085 --> 35:26.436
I can feel the excitement
already. Can you guys?

35:26.530 --> 35:28.058
♪ The last time... ♪

35:28.089 --> 35:29.508
Y'all ready?

35:29.533 --> 35:32.236
- Yep.
- Well, I just got off the phone with Carlotta.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.340
She down there in
Miami, nervous as hell.

35:34.371 --> 35:37.096
Hey, y-y'all don't feel kind
of weird celebrating like this

35:37.098 --> 35:38.856
- after what happened last night?
- Well, I just hope this

35:38.875 --> 35:40.707
PR disaster don't
affect these nominations.

35:40.732 --> 35:42.156
Are you guys ready?

35:42.181 --> 35:44.028
I'm so excited!

35:44.047 --> 35:46.030
It's time.

35:46.049 --> 35:50.135
In the gateway of Best Song...

35:54.057 --> 35:56.241
Noah Brooks and Alex Crane...

35:56.243 --> 35:59.228
score the first American
Sound Award nomination

35:59.253 --> 36:00.978
- for "So Sick."
- You did this. You did this.

36:01.002 --> 36:03.825
- You did it, too.
- Thank you.

36:03.850 --> 36:05.959
Thank you.

36:05.961 --> 36:07.460
Congratulations, baby.

36:07.462 --> 36:09.031
Thank you.

36:09.055 --> 36:10.630
First up...

36:10.632 --> 36:12.741
Congratulations, brah.

36:12.817 --> 36:14.137
Irv really loved your performance.

36:14.161 --> 36:17.136
So whatever you did, you keep doing it.

36:17.138 --> 36:18.896
Thank you.

36:18.957 --> 36:21.082
You keep doing it.

36:21.159 --> 36:23.400
Hasan Bahar for "Venom."

36:23.462 --> 36:26.737
And then to round this thing on off,

36:26.798 --> 36:29.740
our Best Song nomination is...

36:29.801 --> 36:31.655
Come on, Star.

36:31.680 --> 36:34.922
...none other than Miss
GiGi Nixon for "Bossy."

36:45.834 --> 36:49.486
Hey, you. Congratulations,
you're nominated.

36:51.639 --> 36:53.573
Hey.

36:56.787 --> 36:59.862
You all right?

37:00.050 --> 37:03.218
You know it was Alex who put
out that video, don't you?

37:03.243 --> 37:07.796
Alex wouldn't put your business
in the street like that.

37:07.914 --> 37:10.011
- Her mom's an alcoholic.
- The only people

37:10.036 --> 37:12.133
that had it in their
phone were her and me.

37:12.252 --> 37:15.286
So if she didn't put it out,
somebody took it out my phone.

37:15.305 --> 37:17.430
You think you know who?

37:19.059 --> 37:22.535
When my mama died,

37:22.537 --> 37:24.962
Ginny and Missy promised to protect me.

37:25.075 --> 37:27.183
But all they argued about

37:27.208 --> 37:30.467
was who would get to make the decisions.

37:30.487 --> 37:34.471
They treated me like a paycheck.

37:34.491 --> 37:37.383
- I'm sure that wasn't true.
- It's a fact.

37:37.385 --> 37:41.329
That's why I know it was
Missy who put the video out.

37:43.500 --> 37:46.317
The messed up part is,

37:46.336 --> 37:49.745
she was just trying to break
our family's toxic-ass cycle,

37:49.864 --> 37:51.747
but she just made it worse.

37:54.511 --> 37:57.494
Drugs got my mom.

37:57.514 --> 37:59.496
And now my aunt.

37:59.558 --> 38:01.665
Who's next? Me?

38:01.726 --> 38:04.247
- Look, it-it doesn't have to be that way.
- No...

38:04.271 --> 38:06.023
Look, when my father left,

38:06.047 --> 38:07.430
my mom picked up the bottle.

38:07.506 --> 38:09.190
I did the same.

38:09.309 --> 38:12.919
Look, we, we do what we see.

38:12.921 --> 38:14.754
What we learn.

38:14.756 --> 38:18.925
But we can unlearn it, right?

38:18.927 --> 38:21.369
I hope so.

38:23.531 --> 38:27.100
Come here. Come, come here.

38:27.127 --> 38:30.603
- Okay. Come on.
- I don't want to be like that.

38:30.630 --> 38:32.288
You won't.

38:32.365 --> 38:34.549
I don't want to be...

38:34.667 --> 38:36.437
IV nurse, report to 7 West.

38:36.461 --> 38:39.220
IV nurse, report to 7 West.

38:41.116 --> 38:43.799
Dr. Watkins, extension 2301.

38:43.894 --> 38:45.801
Dr. Watkins, extension...

38:45.896 --> 38:48.657
Mama called and told me you fell.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.384
Hey, baby.

38:53.403 --> 38:55.628
How's my little girl?

38:55.630 --> 38:57.864
Thank you for coming to see me.

39:00.101 --> 39:02.076
Sit on down.

39:02.236 --> 39:03.453
Come on.

39:05.473 --> 39:09.733
This ain't no "Kum-Bah-Yah," okay?

39:09.794 --> 39:12.478
I'm here to tell you the truth.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.647
You ain't going nowhere
before you hear it.

39:14.649 --> 39:17.402
Now, Lottie, why you
got to be like this?

39:17.427 --> 39:19.279
I done told you, I'll give you

39:19.304 --> 39:21.930
any flavor of ice cream you want.

39:21.955 --> 39:24.214
Just be nice to Daddy.
Now sit on down there.

39:24.425 --> 39:25.934
Come on, baby.

39:26.052 --> 39:28.085
You think I'm Carlotta.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.406
Be nice now. Be...
sit on down with Daddy.

39:30.431 --> 39:32.331
- You raped her!
- Huh?

39:32.333 --> 39:34.167
You raped Carlotta.

39:34.169 --> 39:36.002
You got her pregnant

39:36.004 --> 39:38.762
and left her to grieve
that baby all by herself.

39:38.782 --> 39:40.468
- She was only 15.
- Wait.

39:40.492 --> 39:42.741
- Wh-What's happening
- I cannot hurt you, 'cause that

39:42.766 --> 39:44.489
would require for you to have something

39:44.514 --> 39:47.552
Feelings.

39:47.568 --> 39:52.646
You hurt me. I've let men drag
me and degrade me and beat me,

39:53.105 --> 39:54.732
all because of the approval and the love

39:54.757 --> 39:56.300
that I never got from you.

39:56.302 --> 39:57.651
I'm sorry.

39:57.745 --> 39:59.469
Ain't no apologizing for that.

39:59.471 --> 40:02.097
I mean...

40:02.099 --> 40:06.234
for coming in between you and Carlotta.

40:06.253 --> 40:10.497
Because of me, the two of you aren't...

40:10.615 --> 40:12.883
together.

40:13.969 --> 40:15.669
I'm sorry.

40:15.787 --> 40:18.505
He's alive.

40:18.623 --> 40:24.177
Me and Carlotta's little boy.

40:24.296 --> 40:26.396
He never died.

40:27.499 --> 40:29.441
He's-he's alive.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.732
Of course, my mom's
got to make this moment about her.

40:36.756 --> 40:39.744
You know, maybe she's
calling you to say congratulations.

40:39.769 --> 40:41.678
Right. Yeah, no, I'll call her back.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.956
That's a long conversation.

40:44.210 --> 40:47.553
But I've decided to go to therapy.

40:47.578 --> 40:49.461
Derek convinced me.

40:49.580 --> 40:53.114
That's 'cause Rose kept
calling my ass, so...

40:53.175 --> 40:55.300
You know, I think that's really great.

40:55.419 --> 40:57.619
I think we all need
to try some new things.

40:57.680 --> 41:01.210
What? Does that mean you
trying to be a baby mama?

41:01.235 --> 41:02.457
Absolutely not.

41:02.476 --> 41:05.202
Okay? I'm not ready for that.

41:05.204 --> 41:07.039
You know, finally, I'm
actually happy where I am

41:07.063 --> 41:08.388
and where things are going.

41:08.465 --> 41:10.318
And things are finally
happening for my career.

41:10.342 --> 41:12.893
Music should definitely be your baby.

41:13.011 --> 41:15.837
Corny. Okay? You should
go to therapy about that.

41:15.839 --> 41:19.774
Are you guys ready?
And last but not least.

41:19.827 --> 41:21.976
This is the one, you
guys. This is the one

41:21.996 --> 41:23.904
we've all been waiting for:

41:24.022 --> 41:25.222
Oh, what, so y'all ready?

41:25.249 --> 41:27.670
Best Pop Album.

41:29.561 --> 41:32.654
First up,

41:32.731 --> 41:35.549
Amber Drake for Champagne Dreams.

41:37.678 --> 41:40.512
Seena Melody for Heartbreaker.

41:40.589 --> 41:42.681
Dellan Dana

41:42.706 --> 41:46.441
for Terrible Dream.

41:46.578 --> 41:48.312
And last...

41:50.048 --> 41:53.154
TAKE 3 FOR 3:31.

41:58.056 --> 42:00.866
We did it.

42:02.578 --> 42:05.186
Congrats to Take 3.

42:05.206 --> 42:08.782
- We did it.
- This is crazy.

42:11.309 --> 42:12.884
It's Miss Carlotta.

42:12.909 --> 42:14.788
She's texting congratulations.
She's getting on

42:14.813 --> 42:16.957
a flight right now to
come pick up Star with me.

42:16.982 --> 42:18.366
When Star hears about the nomination,

42:18.385 --> 42:20.737
- she's gonna explode.
- Oh, God.

42:20.762 --> 42:22.390
- She's gonna be impossible.
- Look, can I get me

42:22.414 --> 42:23.630
a bonus now, please?

42:23.748 --> 42:25.949
- Oh, my God.
- For what?

42:25.951 --> 42:28.229
I know what nominations
mean. They mean more coin.

42:28.253 --> 42:29.781
You got it, you got it, and you got it.

42:29.805 --> 42:32.798
Congratulations, girls. Y'all
worked hard, y'all deserve it.

42:48.582 --> 42:49.806
Hey, white trash.

42:50.037 --> 42:52.146
I got a message from Charlene.

42:52.171 --> 42:53.420
And this who she sent?

42:53.445 --> 42:57.214
Bitch, you don't scare me.

42:59.485 --> 43:03.745
You just gonna stand back
there breathing all heavy? Huh?

43:03.764 --> 43:06.124
If you think I'm going out
without a fight, you crazy.

43:10.980 --> 43:12.178
Bitch!
