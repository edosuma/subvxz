WEBVTT

00:10.911 --> 00:12.646
(hip-hop music playing)

00:12.680 --> 00:17.551
* Got your hair done, nails
fixed, and your... *

00:17.585 --> 00:18.719
* Yeah, girl, for real

00:18.752 --> 00:20.554
* 'Cause I'm trying to chill
with you *

00:20.588 --> 00:23.391
* Bounce for me, show me how you
ride to the beat *

00:23.424 --> 00:26.394
* In time, we can pack up and
fly to the beach... *

00:26.427 --> 00:28.362
* Hear she got nice friends

00:28.396 --> 00:30.864
* Frontin' like she ain't a
holla back girl *

00:30.898 --> 00:34.168
* She runnin' game, so I'm
tryin' to move fast on her *

00:34.202 --> 00:36.270
* But the ass on her make it
hard to pass on her *

00:36.304 --> 00:38.539
* She got a waist like Tyra,
face like Myra *

00:38.572 --> 00:41.275
* Walk like a model chick,
damn, girl I gotta hit *

00:41.309 --> 00:44.112
* It's E.P., pants saggin',
in my fitted though *

00:44.145 --> 00:46.580
* Damn, girl, I think I want you
in my next video... *

00:55.889 --> 00:57.525
Hey, you guys, check this out!

00:57.558 --> 00:59.193
What is that, man?

00:59.227 --> 01:01.429
That's straight Five-O.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.566
All right, you ready?
(Amita sighs)

01:05.599 --> 01:09.270
Byzantines fighting side by side
with cowboys and Indians?

01:09.303 --> 01:11.672
I had an imaginative
childhood.

01:11.705 --> 01:14.308
You know, actually,
this garage was once a garage.

01:14.342 --> 01:15.343
CHARLIE: So check it out.
We're deriving

01:15.376 --> 01:17.411
a set of coupled
differential equations

01:17.445 --> 01:18.979
using a fourth order
Runge-Kutta method.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.182
You're kidding me. Huh.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.416
AMITA: He's trying
to see how far

01:22.450 --> 01:23.684
he can fling
a ball of fire.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.586
Ooh. You know, I think
I liked it better when you,

01:25.619 --> 01:27.588
uh, lit dead bugs
with a magnifying glass.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.557
Don did that.
Oh.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.023
Right.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.525
All right!

01:36.530 --> 01:37.698
Bingo!

01:37.731 --> 01:38.732
(Alan laughing)

01:38.766 --> 01:40.000
ALAN:
Good shot!

01:40.033 --> 01:41.569
(knocking at door)

01:41.602 --> 01:43.103
Come in.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.506
Alan Eppes?

01:45.539 --> 01:46.507
ALAN:
Yeah?

01:46.540 --> 01:49.377
Have a nice day.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.579
AMITA:
What was all that about?

01:51.612 --> 01:54.047
Ooh-- It's a project
that I consulted on.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.849
- Which project?
- Kim's Day Night

01:55.883 --> 01:57.050
Golf Center.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.519
CHARLIE: Yeah, that's the
driving range

01:58.552 --> 02:00.521
- in Koreatown, right?
- Yeah. The neighbors

02:00.554 --> 02:02.456
in the surrounding apartments
have been complaining

02:02.490 --> 02:05.058
that the, uh,
floodlights are on 24/7.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.060
Apparently, it's daytime
all night long.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.863
I'm being sued.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.507
What do you say, David?

02:19.540 --> 02:22.310
Badge traces back
to an LAPD officer

02:22.343 --> 02:23.944
went missing
in 1990.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.479
Hmm. Missing how?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.415
We don't know.
Found the badge right there.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.617
Officer's name
was John Everett.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.084
23 years old.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.286
Bureau initially
handled the case

02:32.320 --> 02:33.454
as an unexplained disappearance.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.589
(siren whoops)
DON: Yeah, well,

02:35.623 --> 02:37.458
this should give it
a new perspective, huh?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.493
Reports indicate he went missing
wearing his uniform.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.962
It's looking like a cop killing
with the guy out there

02:41.995 --> 02:43.096
still walking around.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.366
That's Gary Walker
coming up the hill.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.435
LAPD's gonna work with us
on this one.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.136
So, Lieutenant,
how you doing?

02:49.169 --> 02:51.739
You've seen me
on better days, Eppes.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.706
Sinclair.

02:52.740 --> 02:53.907
Is this it?

02:53.941 --> 02:55.543
This is it.

03:00.881 --> 03:06.119
Man who wore this was the finest
young cop I ever knew.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.422
You were close
with John Everett?

03:08.456 --> 03:09.390
Yeah.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.925
Everett was on my
street crime team.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.561
We hit hard and often.

03:13.594 --> 03:16.063
Couple of weeks
before he disappeared,

03:16.096 --> 03:18.065
he killed a real hard-ass
gang banger

03:18.098 --> 03:19.400
named Stephon Bradley.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.269
DAVID: You think him
gone missing

03:21.302 --> 03:22.603
was an act of revenge maybe?

03:22.636 --> 03:25.273
I don't need to think,
I know, Sinclair.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.575
His brother vowed
revenge at the time,

03:27.608 --> 03:29.410
and Everett's
car was found

03:29.443 --> 03:30.578
in his
neighborhood.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.912
What, you couldn't make a case?

03:31.945 --> 03:33.314
Not without a body.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.583
What happened to Bradley?

03:35.616 --> 03:38.218
Did ten years for armed robbery.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.753
Paroled in '02.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.490
Got a college degree while
he was on the inside, too.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.958
I hear he even writes
a little poetry now.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.595
But all that's about to change.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.234
DON: We got this cop
that disappeared

03:54.268 --> 03:57.137
but, uh, the thing is, it
happened 17 years ago.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.439
What can I do?

03:58.472 --> 04:00.374
DAVID: High rise was supposed
to be built,

04:00.408 --> 04:01.709
but a lawsuit
shut it down.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.545
And the lot's been
vacant ever since?

04:04.578 --> 04:06.747
This area right here--
that's where the kids found

04:06.780 --> 04:07.815
Officer Everett's badge.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.718
Okay. A construction site
would be a pretty good place

04:10.751 --> 04:11.485
to hide a body.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.321
Yeah. Crew could bury
over the body without

04:13.354 --> 04:14.388
ever knowing
about it.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.623
Mm-hmm. Of course,
on the flip side,

04:15.656 --> 04:17.591
doesn't mean that
there's a body there.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.059
WALKER:
Oh, there's a body.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.594
Trust me, Agent Reeves.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.830
Of course, I'm-I'm sorry.
I just mean,

04:22.863 --> 04:24.798
it's a lot of ground
to cover there.

04:24.832 --> 04:25.999
Charlie?

04:26.033 --> 04:27.435
Um...

04:27.468 --> 04:28.802
laser swath mapping.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.904
Well, take me back
to school, Professor.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.406
It's a lot like radar.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.641
Instead of sending out

04:33.674 --> 04:35.876
radio waves,
we're shooting laser pulses,

04:35.909 --> 04:37.177
which will allow me

04:37.210 --> 04:39.279
to create a
highly accurate,

04:39.313 --> 04:42.550
3-D, uh, topographical map
of the area.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.852
And then we look
for abnormal erosion

04:44.885 --> 04:46.520
in the Earth's surface.

04:46.554 --> 04:50.123
See, ground earth is compact
until it's disturbed.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.625
It's like when
you dig a grave.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.793
Right, when
a person's body

04:52.826 --> 04:54.695
is buried, uh, erosion

04:54.728 --> 04:59.299
and decomposition create
a depression in the earth.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.335
Um, here,
let me take this, um...

05:01.369 --> 05:02.503
this bowl of...

05:02.536 --> 05:05.539
this bowl of popcorn,
for example, and imagine

05:05.573 --> 05:09.943
that this is the earth
under which a body is buried.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.745
And this water
represents

05:11.779 --> 05:13.681
erosion, time...

05:13.714 --> 05:15.516
(laughing):
And there goes my lunch.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.850
CHARLIE:
See that depression?

05:16.884 --> 05:19.319
That is what our lasers

05:19.353 --> 05:20.488
are looking for.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.589
Well, that sounds
real good

05:21.622 --> 05:23.457
as long as we
locate my man.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.625
See, this isn't just

05:24.658 --> 05:26.527
an unsolved homicide
for me. I knew John.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.664
I was responsible for him,
as I am for all of my men.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.666
17 years ago,

05:32.700 --> 05:36.370
John's wife had to bury
an empty coffin,

05:36.404 --> 05:37.771
and we didn't have the evidence

05:37.805 --> 05:39.707
to take down his killer,
Calvin Bradley.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.075
It's time
to bring Everett home...

05:44.545 --> 05:46.514
...get this cop killer
off the streets.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.356
MEGAN: There's Walker's team
back in 1990,

05:56.390 --> 06:00.027
and Everett, who was
married for three years.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.128
Had a little boy

06:01.161 --> 06:03.864
who is now 19 years old.

06:03.897 --> 06:04.898
According to Walker,

06:04.932 --> 06:07.334
he and the team stay close
to the family.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.102
Yeah, survivor's
guilt, probably.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.905
Hey, Liz,

06:11.939 --> 06:13.040
thanks for helping us out.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.408
Yeah, no problem.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.510
I was getting tired
of driving around Compton

06:16.544 --> 06:18.111
breaking down
doors anyway.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.747
Ooh, gang detail.

06:19.780 --> 06:20.914
Mm-hmm.

06:20.948 --> 06:21.982
War on drugs knows no end.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.117
Anyway, these are the files
you asked for.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.654
Okay, and Calvin Bradley?

06:26.687 --> 06:28.989
He ran with a black gang
known as BSF:

06:29.022 --> 06:31.158
Bixel Street Family.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.426
I asked around.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.161
He's actually a bit of a legend.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.328
Yeah? How so?

06:35.362 --> 06:37.297
Guy clearly is no angel,
but word now,

06:37.330 --> 06:39.132
he's a changed
man, and, uh,

06:39.166 --> 06:40.568
runs a program helping kids.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.603
And he's been clean
since his brother's death?

06:42.636 --> 06:46.339
You mean since Everett's.

06:46.373 --> 06:48.408
Uh-huh.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.779
Hard to believe

06:51.812 --> 06:53.981
we may finally find Everett
after all these years.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.617
To think he's been
rotting out there all this time.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.318
While Calvin Bradley's
been walking around

06:58.351 --> 06:59.520
a free man.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.622
No thanks
to the FBI.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.156
Hey, what? Excuse me?
OFFICER: Let's just

07:03.190 --> 07:04.391
say the Feds didn't put

07:04.424 --> 07:05.759
much manpower on it
at the time.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.394
Look, I wasn't there
at the time, okay?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.262
Hey, listen, this has been
a very tough day

07:09.296 --> 07:10.498
for all of us, but, uh,

07:10.531 --> 07:11.799
we're all on the
same page now,

07:11.832 --> 07:13.634
and, uh, Eppes
has just come here

07:13.667 --> 07:15.636
to find out what happened the
day that Everett disappeared.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.104
I mean, if there's anything
you remember, you know,

07:17.137 --> 07:19.072
that's come back to you,
you know what I'm after.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.145
OFFICER 2:
Night before,

07:25.178 --> 07:27.114
a ten-year-old girl
was killed in a drive-by.

07:27.147 --> 07:30.417
Word was a BSF crew had raided
a rival gang's stash house.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.519
What's BSF?

07:31.552 --> 07:32.653
Bixel Street
Family.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.522
That was Bradley's gang
at the time.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.389
Anyway, team had
the day off.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.526
Commanders wanted
everyone on it.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.793
Kid gets killed,
politicians want action.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.995
Well, you know
how it is.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.296
(horn honks)

07:43.330 --> 07:44.798
So I called everybody in.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.233
OFFICER 1: Everett had some
appointments,

07:46.266 --> 07:47.701
didn't get the
word till late.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.837
By the time he rolled,
we were all out on the street.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.840
That was the last
we heard of him.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.542
WOMAN: What's going on?
I got your call.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.909
- Did you find him?
- No, no, no, not yet.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.845
Not yet, not yet.
I don't understand.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.013
Well, some kids...
some kids found his badge.

08:00.047 --> 08:00.781
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.850
What am I gonna
tell Kevin?

08:02.883 --> 08:05.052
You just let us talk
to him, all right?

08:05.085 --> 08:06.720
Thanks.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.689
All this time,
I keep thinking...

08:09.823 --> 08:11.525
What's that all about?

08:11.559 --> 08:12.893
That's Everett's wife.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.962
She's worried
about their son Kevin.

08:14.995 --> 08:15.829
Uh-huh.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.365
We tried to be
like a dad to him.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.367
You can see why

08:20.400 --> 08:23.403
we want Calvin Bradley
brought to justice.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.939
Charlie, have you seen the...?

08:25.973 --> 08:27.274
Laser Swath Mapping?

08:27.307 --> 08:29.042
Yeah. Are you
familiar with it?

08:29.076 --> 08:29.943
I am.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.245
I consulted once with
the Army Corps of Engineers.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.914
- Oh, my.
- They were checking

08:33.947 --> 08:37.050
for coastal erosion
along the Gulf, but this...

08:37.084 --> 08:39.086
- This looks local.
- Well... (clears throat)

08:39.119 --> 08:40.721
I'm helping the FBI

08:40.754 --> 08:43.557
locate a missing police officer.

08:43.591 --> 08:44.725
A missing police officer?

08:44.758 --> 08:46.193
I didn't hear anything
about that

08:46.226 --> 08:47.360
in the news.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.495
Well, it was
back in 1990.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.698
A bunch of kids
just recently

08:50.731 --> 08:52.866
found his badge
in an empty lot.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.768
So, you're looking for...?

08:54.802 --> 08:56.837
His body.
Oh, goodness.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.806
That-That's an awful thing
to happen.

08:58.839 --> 08:59.807
Yeah.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.875
So, um, have you seen Amita?

09:01.909 --> 09:03.443
She was in her office earlier.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.712
She's probably hiding from me.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.714
Why would she be hiding
from you?

09:06.747 --> 09:10.884
Because she resigned as Chair of
the Curriculum Committee.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.019
She resigned?

09:12.052 --> 09:12.953
Mm-hmm.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.454
In an e-mail.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.856
Chairing that committee

09:15.889 --> 09:18.291
is an incredible opportunity
for her...

09:20.594 --> 09:21.528
Hey, Charlie, um,

09:21.561 --> 09:24.064
I left your dad
a couple of messages,

09:24.097 --> 09:25.833
and I haven't heard back
from him yet,

09:25.866 --> 09:27.234
and I was
wondering if

09:27.267 --> 09:30.537
you knew if there's a reason
he's not calling me?

09:30.570 --> 09:31.805
(laughs)

09:31.839 --> 09:33.073
Well, he's being sued.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.107
He's being sued?!

09:34.141 --> 09:35.475
Yeah.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.777
Apparently, a golf driving range

09:36.810 --> 09:41.915
he's been working on has become
an eyesore, literally.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.784
OFFICER 2:
Yeah, that's him.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.786
That's Calvin Bradley.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.722
I thought associating
with gang members

09:48.756 --> 09:50.924
was a violation
of his parole?

09:50.958 --> 09:53.360
Oh, he applied to a judge
for an exception.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.762
Claimed he was
rehabilitating them.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.596
You guys seem pretty sure

09:56.630 --> 09:58.431
he's the one who
killed Officer Everett.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.100
OFFICER 1:
In 1990,

10:00.133 --> 10:02.569
Bradley's bragging to
anybody who will listen,

10:02.602 --> 10:04.204
he's gonna get revenge
on Everett

10:04.237 --> 10:05.906
for killing his brother.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.708
Words don't always
mean action.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.643
OFFICER 2: Out there, you
learned real quick

10:09.677 --> 10:11.745
there was no such thing
as an idle threat.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.613
I grew up in this
neighborhood, all right?

10:13.647 --> 10:14.915
Half the gang
bangers I busted,

10:14.948 --> 10:19.019
I knew, and if they said it,
they did it.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.022
We find John Everett's body,
this scumbag's going down.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.961
So these are all the spots
I have.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.163
How far down
do they have to dig?

10:30.197 --> 10:30.964
Oh, just about...

10:30.998 --> 10:32.933
just about four feet or so.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.736
You worked that gang case last
year, developed those, uh...

10:35.769 --> 10:37.037
What are they called?

10:37.070 --> 10:37.838
Shooting chains?

10:37.871 --> 10:42.075
Yeah, a, uh, murder leads
to a retaliation,

10:42.109 --> 10:44.878
and another and another,
and, yeah, it's a...

10:44.912 --> 10:46.546
it's a domino effect, sure.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.515
Any chance you could
do that here?

10:48.548 --> 10:49.717
See if any other slayings

10:49.750 --> 10:51.584
connect this cop's death
to Calvin Bradley?

10:51.618 --> 10:53.386
Yeah, it's quite possible.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.922
Where's your brother?

10:54.955 --> 10:55.823
Hmm?

10:55.856 --> 10:57.958
Oh, he's off
with the LAPD.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.593
Does he know that
you're on this case?

11:00.627 --> 11:02.963
No. I haven't had a
chance to tell him.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.632
Oh, well, that'll be
a nice surprise for him.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.934
You think?

11:06.967 --> 11:09.169
I mean, has he said something
to you?

11:09.202 --> 11:12.272
'Cause, you know, I...
he's just been a little...

11:12.305 --> 11:13.606
Well, he's...

11:13.640 --> 11:16.209
He's been going through
some stuff.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.244
Stuff?

11:17.277 --> 11:18.746
Yeah.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.214
I think you should talk
to him about it.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.482
Sure.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.218
AGENT: Agent Warner,
we got something.

11:26.553 --> 11:29.289
C1, just as
I had suspected.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.996
It's him. It's Everett.

11:38.365 --> 11:42.135
LIZ: The Preliminary Coroner's
investigation here

11:42.169 --> 11:44.571
indicates Everett had a single
gunshot wound to the head.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.306
Fracturing indicates it was

11:46.339 --> 11:47.975
probably at close range.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.110
So this was
an execution.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.879
Never been any
doubt about that.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.347
Somehow Bradley got his
hands on Everett...

11:54.381 --> 11:55.048
walked him to the

11:55.082 --> 11:57.818
construction site and
planted one in his dome.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.053
Then he dumped
him in a ditch,

12:00.087 --> 12:03.056
and waited for a construction
crew to seal his tomb.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.325
Maybe. But can you prove it?

12:05.358 --> 12:07.394
Well, I'm gonna let
Bradley to do that for me.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.529
What makes you think
he's gonna talk to you now?

12:09.562 --> 12:10.831
1990, I didn't
have a body.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.500
Bradley knew that.
Now I do.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.883
Calvin Bradley, FBI, open up!

12:29.917 --> 12:32.319
BRADLEY: LAPD. What the
hell's going on?

12:33.821 --> 12:35.923
(yelling)

12:38.191 --> 12:40.360
DAVID:
Get off him! Back off!

12:43.463 --> 12:44.364
We're done here!

12:47.234 --> 12:50.370
BRADLEY:
You see me here with no lawyer

12:50.403 --> 12:53.106
because I have nothing to hide.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.475
Yeah, why is it you look like
you got something to hide, huh?

12:55.508 --> 12:58.145
17 years, nothing changes.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.948
And you people wonder why we
don't want to help the cops.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.617
DAVID:
We found him, Calvin.

13:04.651 --> 13:05.853
You know who that is, right?

13:05.886 --> 13:07.020
LAPD officer
John Everett.

13:07.054 --> 13:11.024
Same cop that killed your
little brother 17 years ago.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.725
And disappeared two weeks later.

13:12.759 --> 13:16.263
I have nothing to do with this.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.130
Several witnesses say

13:17.164 --> 13:19.867
you threatened
Officer Everett's life.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.769
I was young.
I was a hothead.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.337
Said some things
I didn't mean.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.206
DON: Hey, his car was found
a couple hundred feet

13:26.239 --> 13:28.041
from your house.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.643
Calvin, you've spent more time
in a law library than we have.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.379
You know that car
gives you opportunity

13:32.412 --> 13:33.713
and your brother's death,

13:33.746 --> 13:34.882
that gives you motive.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.450
My little brother
was shot down like a dog.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.186
Police didn't investigate.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.921
- You guys didn't care.
DON: Your little brother

13:40.954 --> 13:43.456
was a drug dealer who ran
with one of the most

13:43.490 --> 13:44.858
violent gangs in the city.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.927
You make it sound like
Stephon had a choice.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.328
Like any of us did.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.063
Got one choice out there, man:
Live or die.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.699
Is that what you told
Officer Everett

13:52.732 --> 13:55.135
when you put a bullet
through his skull?

13:55.168 --> 13:58.105
I've already been to prison
for crimes I committed.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.773
I'm not going back
for one I didn't do.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.809
Life without parole.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.279
Okay? That's the only time
you're going to hear that offer.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.950
You people think my brother
got what he deserved.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.019
Well...

14:12.052 --> 14:14.521
I think same might
be said for this cop.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.557
What was that you said?

14:17.590 --> 14:18.992
DON: All right.
- Say that again.

14:19.026 --> 14:19.993
Listen, Gary, come on.
Hey, Gary.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.995
Gary, Gary! Hey Gary!

14:22.029 --> 14:23.796
All right, all right. Listen.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.632
Down.

14:25.665 --> 14:26.633
Could I talk to
you for a second?

14:26.666 --> 14:27.968
Yeah, yeah.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.373
You can't do that
around here, you know?

14:33.406 --> 14:34.407
You gotta calm down.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.308
Whew. Okay.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.777
He wants to desecrate the
memory of one of my men.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.380
You just let me have a piece
of him, I'll get a confession.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.248
No, I can't do that.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.983
Come on, Eppes,
just take a walk,

14:43.016 --> 14:44.751
go have dinner
or whatever.

14:44.784 --> 14:45.852
I understand how you feel.

14:45.885 --> 14:46.954
It's not gonna happen,
all right?

14:46.987 --> 14:48.621
Okay, listen.
Before Everett disappeared,

14:48.655 --> 14:50.991
he was worried about
retribution.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.659
He had heard things
on the street.

14:52.692 --> 14:53.961
And we're running that down.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.229
Yeah, well, I've been running
it down for 17 years.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.931
And now,

14:57.965 --> 14:59.066
you have the man.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.833
You have him sitting right here.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.635
The man who killed him.
Now, if you two don't

15:02.669 --> 15:03.436
have the stomach for it--

15:03.470 --> 15:04.671
DON: That's not the case.
Calm down.

15:04.704 --> 15:05.538
All right? We tried.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.507
We don't have enough
to hold the guy. Period.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.977
Are you setting him free?

15:10.010 --> 15:11.678
Yeah, you bet I'm
setting him loose.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.547
Excuse me.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.685
(groans)
- Someone's not happy.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.287
Bradley called
our bluff.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.155
Well, it's about to get
more interesting.

15:22.189 --> 15:23.156
The ballistics are in.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.993
The bullet that killed
Everett came from a .38.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.028
- What? A revolver?
- A revolver that was issued

15:28.061 --> 15:31.231
to Everett.
It's his duty weapon.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.101
Same gun that killed
Stephon Bradley.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.902
That would mean Everett was
killed with his own gun.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.604
Yeah.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.879
Kevin wouldn't
even remember his dad

15:46.913 --> 15:48.515
if it weren't
for those guys.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.718
They took him to ball
games, camping trips...

15:51.751 --> 15:54.121
How's he holding up?

15:54.154 --> 15:58.458
It's been tough...
watching me get through this.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.993
But he's lucky.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.229
He's got four great
surrogate dads.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.331
When Lieutenant Walker said
that your husband

16:04.364 --> 16:06.366
had some concerns
after shooting

16:06.399 --> 16:07.267
Stephon Bradley.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.502
Uh, that's his way
of saying he was upset.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.240
Case you haven't noticed,
Lieutenant Walker

16:13.273 --> 16:15.908
doesn't exactly
express himself well.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.610
Emotionally, I mean.

16:17.644 --> 16:21.781
Truth is, the shooting
changed my husband.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.851
He wasn't prepared for the way
he felt after killing that kid.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.286
Was he depressed?

16:26.319 --> 16:28.721
- Depressed?
- Did he have trouble eating?

16:28.755 --> 16:29.722
Or sleeping?

16:29.756 --> 16:31.991
What are you asking me?

16:33.126 --> 16:35.728
Well, our forensics indicate
that your husband

16:35.762 --> 16:37.397
was killed with his own gun.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.333
You think he killed himself?

16:42.302 --> 16:46.839
No... No, he wouldn't do that.

16:46.873 --> 16:50.743
Well, I'm sorry to put you
through this. We just, uh...

16:50.777 --> 16:53.080
we just wanted to be sure.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.788
Walker's got Bradley
tried and convicted.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.023
Yeah, I know, I know.

17:04.057 --> 17:07.227
- Want some coffee?
- No, I'm good.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.730
So what's going on?

17:10.763 --> 17:11.631
Is everything okay?

17:11.664 --> 17:13.300
Yeah, yeah,
just some stuff.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.802
I mean, I don't really
want to talk about it.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.875
Talking's not exactly
what I had in mind.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.545
Uh, isn't this
sexual harassment?

17:25.578 --> 17:27.980
I'll show you
sexual harassment.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.649
Hey.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.687
I want your input on that,
Eppes. Yeah.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.188
Roger that.

17:36.956 --> 17:39.592
AMITA:
That's amazing.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.795
I mean, in 1977,
there were fewer than...

17:42.829 --> 17:45.031
500 murders in Los Angeles.

17:45.064 --> 17:48.635
And by 1985,
the number doubled.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.470
Well, there must be
some sort of causal

17:50.503 --> 17:51.604
explanation for those
statistics.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.906
Yeah, I mean, it was
the introduction of mass

17:53.940 --> 17:55.575
drug sales by the gangs,
you know?

17:55.608 --> 17:58.778
Fights over street corners--
territories shifting

17:58.811 --> 18:00.447
led to more killings.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.355
What?

18:08.388 --> 18:10.089
You quit.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.626
What are you talking about?

18:14.561 --> 18:16.763
Chair of the Curriculum
Committee.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.166
You know how
huge that is.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.735
I can't believe she told you.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.337
You know, neither Larry nor I
were ever asked

18:24.371 --> 18:25.638
to chair that committee.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.674
There's some pretty
heavy hitters, you know.

18:27.707 --> 18:28.941
It can be intimidating.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.178
- I mean, maybe not for you...
- Well, I've seen you

18:31.211 --> 18:33.213
with the faculty;
you're very good.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.884
Some of the professors talk.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.820
About us.
What?!

18:40.853 --> 18:41.821
Oh, it doesn't matter.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.022
- No, just tell me...
- What,

18:43.055 --> 18:44.524
so that you can protect me?

18:44.557 --> 18:46.759
Look, you can't and you
shouldn't have to.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.795
I'm just not ready for this.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.402
Agent Reeves,

18:55.435 --> 18:57.537
did you mention
something about suicide?

18:57.570 --> 19:01.508
Did you mention to Everett's
wife that he killed himself?

19:01.541 --> 19:03.443
- No, I never said that.
- I know you didn't.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.479
But did you say something about,
"Well, was he depressed...?"

19:06.513 --> 19:09.015
Eh, he was depressed,
Lieutenant.

19:09.048 --> 19:11.150
Now, you shouldn't...

19:11.184 --> 19:13.520
You really had no
right to do that.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.455
Don't come in here
telling us what rights

19:15.488 --> 19:16.556
we do or don't have, Gary.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.525
Now, I understand
how you feel...

19:18.558 --> 19:19.559
No, I don't think you
do understand, Eppes.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.261
I don't think understand
how I feel.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.962
I don't think you know what
it's like to living it

19:22.995 --> 19:25.131
in the streets,
the way we do.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.766
And back then, it was a war.

19:26.799 --> 19:30.102
Cops were dying every day,
trying to take back this city.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.171
And Everett was one of them.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.806
Did you know Everett was
killed with his own gun?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.643
What?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.478
Yeah, ballistics matched
the bullet to the .38

19:38.511 --> 19:40.580
that killed Bradley,
all right? Take a look.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.648
I don't need to see that.
What are you talking about?

19:41.681 --> 19:44.517
That means that Bradley
got a hold of Everett's gun

19:44.551 --> 19:45.652
- and he shot him with it.
- So what?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.387
The body was buried, remember?
How did that happen?

19:47.420 --> 19:48.621
I said it before: the
construction crew could've

19:48.655 --> 19:51.190
buried his body and
not ever knew about it.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.492
What are you doing?
Are you writing

19:52.525 --> 19:54.794
Calvin Bradley's
closing argument now?

19:54.827 --> 19:57.930
I knew Everett. He wouldn't
have killed himself.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.435
I got something.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.805
CHARLIE: The gang case
I worked on last year,

20:05.838 --> 20:07.507
my guiding principle was
their territorial nature.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.742
And it turned out some of
these gang members spent

20:09.776 --> 20:12.111
their whole lives living
within a 10-block radius.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.513
Their turf.
Right, I remember.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.548
They live a mile from
the ocean; some of them

20:15.582 --> 20:17.417
have never even
seen it...

20:17.450 --> 20:21.020
Right, so here is a map
of all known gang territories

20:21.053 --> 20:24.457
back in 1990 and, using the
theory of collective behavior,

20:24.491 --> 20:25.592
I...

20:25.625 --> 20:29.095
Lieutenant Walker,
imagine a colony of ants

20:29.128 --> 20:30.229
searching for food.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.431
They send out a scout

20:31.464 --> 20:34.367
and that scout wanders
around randomly.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.536
If that scout finds food,
well, then the colony

20:36.569 --> 20:38.605
marks that path as good.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.641
If he doesn't find food, then
that path is marked as neutral.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.209
And if that scout
never returns,

20:43.242 --> 20:45.211
you better believe that
path is marked as bad.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.747
Same thing
works with gangs.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.249
Calvin Bradley was a member
of the Bixel Street Family.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.419
This was their territory
back in 1990.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.722
Everett's body
was found here

20:55.755 --> 20:57.056
in an area controlled
by a gang called

20:57.089 --> 20:59.359
the 18 Street Mexicali.

20:59.392 --> 21:03.162
18 Street Mexicali and Bixel
Steet Family were rivals.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.898
Factoring in for
territorial gang shifts...

21:08.335 --> 21:12.472
I cannot find
a single safe passage.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.973
DON: For Bradley to
travel from his turf

21:14.006 --> 21:16.809
to a rival's turf to even
have killed Everett.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.045
CHARLIE: It would be like a
Sunni going for a ride

21:19.078 --> 21:20.380
in a Shi'ite neighborhood.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.982
Calvin Bradley probably
wasn't our killer.

21:33.926 --> 21:34.627
MEGAN:
So Calvin Bradley

21:34.661 --> 21:37.630
would've had trouble getting
to the crime scene, which...

21:37.664 --> 21:38.798
doesn't make him innocent.

21:38.831 --> 21:42.369
Yeah, Charlie's math is all
about probabilities.

21:42.402 --> 21:45.705
So, if he says it's unlikely,
it probably is...

21:45.738 --> 21:47.239
MEGAN: Which takes us back
to what?

21:47.273 --> 21:48.708
Suicide?

21:48.741 --> 21:52.011
Well, what if we just keep
following the probabilities.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.279
Meaning what?

21:53.312 --> 21:54.714
Well, if the math says
it's doubtful anyone

21:54.747 --> 21:56.349
from a rival gang
would have access

21:56.383 --> 21:58.718
to the 18 Street
Mexicali territories,

21:58.751 --> 22:00.720
that narrows
our suspect list down.

22:00.753 --> 22:03.856
To someone in the 18 Street
Mexicali crew. Right.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.525
I'll talk to Charlie
about running some names.

22:08.961 --> 22:09.729
(knocking on door)

22:09.762 --> 22:10.630
(door opens)

22:10.663 --> 22:12.298
- Hey! Wow! What's going on?
- Whoa!

22:12.331 --> 22:14.333
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, the door was open.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.402
- I hope you don't mind.
- Oh, no, no.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.302
- Not at all. Come in.
- Good.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.137
Thanks. Wow.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.406
What's going on?

22:19.439 --> 22:21.273
I love what you've done
with the room, huh.

22:21.307 --> 22:22.709
You do?
Very, uh, "Early American

22:22.742 --> 22:25.277
interrogation room"--
it's nice.

22:25.311 --> 22:26.946
- I can see your pores.
- You notice, eh?

22:26.979 --> 22:27.914
So, so what?

22:27.947 --> 22:29.716
Charlie told me about
this whole lawsuit thing.

22:29.749 --> 22:32.184
I just wanted to come
give you some moral support.

22:32.218 --> 22:33.586
Well, uh, thank you,
I appreciate that,

22:33.620 --> 22:35.422
but what I really
need are answers.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.323
Yeah, to what?
I've been going

22:37.356 --> 22:38.425
over my original calculations.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.258
They're absolutely right.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.560
I just don't understand

22:40.593 --> 22:42.328
what the problem is
with the lighting.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.464
I tried to
simulate it here.

22:45.465 --> 22:48.401
Angles of incidence, good.

22:48.435 --> 22:51.438
You got reflection,
absorption,

22:51.471 --> 22:53.372
saturation coefficients.

22:53.406 --> 22:56.275
Very impressive,
very impressive, Mr. Eppes.

22:56.308 --> 22:57.577
Now I see where Charlie gets
his interest

22:57.610 --> 22:58.945
- his interest in numbers.
- Well, I'm afraid

22:58.978 --> 23:01.380
there's only one genius
in this family.

23:01.414 --> 23:02.449
Oh, I don't know.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.517
Hey, I know, I know Charlie's
busy helping out Don,

23:04.551 --> 23:06.519
and if you're interested
I'm available.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.389
To go over your figures.

23:10.423 --> 23:11.758
- My figures?
- Yes.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.392
- I got it.
- Put your head down.

23:13.426 --> 23:14.927
(laughing)

23:16.863 --> 23:18.665
DON: What do you say,
Lieutenant?

23:21.568 --> 23:23.135
It's happy hour
somewhere, right?

23:23.169 --> 23:24.370
Let me get a
club soda.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.472
BARTENDER:
Club soda.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.507
You know that
I've been trying

23:27.540 --> 23:30.376
to pin this on Calvin
Bradley for 17 years.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.211
It's a little hard
for me to believe

23:32.244 --> 23:33.446
that, after all this time,

23:33.480 --> 23:35.615
I might have been looking
at the wrong guy.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.850
Hey, look, it's
not over yet.

23:37.884 --> 23:38.851
Here you go, sir.

23:38.885 --> 23:39.952
Thanks.

23:39.986 --> 23:42.121
Well, you'd think that I would
know after all this time

23:42.154 --> 23:45.424
that things are... they're just
never what they seem.

23:45.458 --> 23:46.559
You follow
your gut.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.227
There's nothing else you can do.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.797
It's a whole different world
out there now, Eppes.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.332
It's a whole different way
of policing, a whole new way.

23:53.365 --> 23:56.168
Down is up, up is down.

23:58.471 --> 24:01.307
Everett wouldn't have
killed himself.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.876
That's not the man I knew.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.278
So, tell me
about 18 Street guy?

24:06.312 --> 24:09.549
Well, they're not around
anymore, that's one thing.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.818
And they used to be one
of the biggest drug suppliers

24:11.851 --> 24:13.052
- on the West Coast.
- All right.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.687
So, if Everett was shot
in their territory,

24:14.721 --> 24:16.022
then somebody knows something.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.357
I mean, come on,
somebody had to have seen

24:18.390 --> 24:20.259
something, right?

24:20.292 --> 24:22.895
Yeah.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.265
Hey.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.399
How you doing?

24:27.433 --> 24:29.769
Tell me where Jimmy Lopez is?

24:29.802 --> 24:31.671
The other side of this cab.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.245
Jimmy Lopez?

24:39.278 --> 24:40.847
FBI. I'd like
to talk to you

24:40.880 --> 24:41.514
for a minute.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.015
- FBI?
- Yeah.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.551
Get your hands up.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.518
How you doing,
Jimmy?

24:45.552 --> 24:46.953
Officer Walker.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.087
You got a good memory.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.522
What's, uh...

24:49.556 --> 24:50.990
what's going on
here, guys?

24:51.023 --> 24:52.659
WALKER: We thought
we would take a trip

24:52.692 --> 24:53.793
down memory lane.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.695
Yeah, maybe you didn't hear,
but...

24:55.728 --> 24:57.496
I don't snitch no more.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.430
Is that right?

24:58.464 --> 25:00.667
Well, they found Officer
Everett's body.

25:00.700 --> 25:01.601
Who?

25:01.634 --> 25:02.635
Officer John Everett.

25:03.636 --> 25:06.573
Nah, that name don't ring
a bell.

25:07.439 --> 25:09.776
Well, he was
found buried

25:09.809 --> 25:12.011
in 18 Street
Mexicali territory,

25:12.044 --> 25:13.846
so his name better start ringing
some bells

25:13.880 --> 25:16.182
or I'm gonna ring
your bell.

25:16.215 --> 25:19.451
I never had nothing
to do with killing no cop.

25:19.485 --> 25:20.486
There's no way
he gets shot

25:20.519 --> 25:21.988
in your territory

25:22.021 --> 25:22.922
and it's not the news
of the decade.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.991
No statute of limitations
on murder, Jimmy.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.092
You know that, right?

25:27.359 --> 25:30.229
I heard what everyone else
heard, okay?

25:30.262 --> 25:31.397
What's that?

25:31.430 --> 25:33.132
The cop was whacked courtesy
of the BSF.

25:33.165 --> 25:34.333
Payback for some shooting.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.568
So, what's he doing

25:35.602 --> 25:36.969
in the 18 Street's territory?

25:37.003 --> 25:39.672
No offense,

25:39.706 --> 25:41.674
but when it came
to killing cops,

25:41.708 --> 25:44.744
gang bangers can find
some pretty common ground.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.082
(door shuts)

25:50.116 --> 25:51.618
Oh, hey.
There you are.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.252
I went by your office
looking for you.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.321
You did?

25:55.354 --> 25:56.388
Yeah, I just wanted to talk.

25:56.422 --> 25:58.357
About what?
Mm...

25:58.390 --> 26:03.095
You know, I thought about
walking away myself once.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.496
You did.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.432
Was first time I orally defended

26:06.465 --> 26:07.934
a dissertation.

26:07.967 --> 26:11.403
Charlie Eppes,
not confident about math?

26:11.437 --> 26:13.472
I was more scared
of quitting

26:13.505 --> 26:15.307
than I was of going
through with it,

26:15.341 --> 26:16.676
so...

26:16.709 --> 26:19.278
I couldn't walk away.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.613
I'm gonna do it.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.581
I'm gonna chair that committee.
- You are?

26:22.615 --> 26:25.417
I may make some mistakes...

26:25.451 --> 26:26.418
No, you're gonna be great.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.420
You're gonna be great.
I'll help you.

26:28.454 --> 26:30.056
You know, if you
want my help.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.058
I'm not saying
you need my help.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.592
If you want it.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.461
I will take all the help
I can get.

26:35.494 --> 26:36.629
See that?

26:36.663 --> 26:37.664
We're a lot alike.

26:37.697 --> 26:38.798
'Cause I'm always

26:38.831 --> 26:41.300
asking you for help.
Yes.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.469
Speaking of help...

26:43.502 --> 26:46.205
I see you're still
after that cop killer.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.207
Yeah.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.576
Liz Warner says that
he might be a member

26:50.609 --> 26:53.579
of a street gang
called 18 Street Mexicali.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.447
But none of the shooting
chains are tracking back

26:55.481 --> 26:56.615
to a common shooter.

26:56.649 --> 26:58.117
That's right.
What are you thinking?

26:58.150 --> 26:59.952
You used collective
behavior theory

26:59.986 --> 27:02.454
to define the path the
killer could have taken.

27:02.488 --> 27:06.492
But that's not
the whole story.

27:06.525 --> 27:09.228
You're missing
a variable.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.163
The victim.

27:11.197 --> 27:15.501
I need to know the path
that Everett was taking as well.

27:15.534 --> 27:17.436
DON:
All right, so according to this

27:17.469 --> 27:18.705
18 Street had two
triggers

27:18.738 --> 27:20.139
at the time
of Everett's death.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.008
WALKER: It could still be
anyone in the gang.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.442
I hoping your brother's
got an answer.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.510
All right,
Charlie, hey,

27:24.543 --> 27:26.645
tell me you got a name
for us.

27:26.679 --> 27:27.714
No, no.
Something else.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.148
Charlie looked at
the timeline of events

27:29.181 --> 27:30.649
for Everett on the day
he was killed.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.052
And I applied
critical path analysis,

27:33.085 --> 27:35.087
which is a mathematical
way of looking

27:35.121 --> 27:37.556
at the most effective manner
to complete tasks.

27:37.589 --> 27:38.991
If you're cooking
a holiday dinner,

27:39.025 --> 27:40.860
and you cook it all
at the same time,

27:40.893 --> 27:43.129
well, some of your food's
gonna end up burnt.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.064
Some of your food's
gonna end up cold.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.233
What you need to do
is prepare and cook

27:47.266 --> 27:49.736
each part of the meal
in an effective order

27:49.769 --> 27:52.038
and monitor them simultaneously

27:52.071 --> 27:55.107
so that you serve all hot food
at all the same time.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.977
Now, the same concept applies
for Everett.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.980
And he changed two appointments
he made that day.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.549
DON:
All right... I mean,

28:03.582 --> 28:04.550
so why's this significant?

28:04.583 --> 28:05.885
Because people tend

28:05.918 --> 28:07.987
to schedule meetings
as close to one another

28:08.020 --> 28:08.988
as they can.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.157
Schedule them
in a progressive order,

28:11.190 --> 28:13.159
- if they can.
- Kind of like a...

28:13.192 --> 28:14.293
math of convenience.

28:14.326 --> 28:17.129
But his body and his car were
found a few miles apart.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.431
Meaning that either
Everett was killed

28:19.465 --> 28:22.869
where he was found and his car
was moved afterwards or...

28:22.902 --> 28:24.737
Or else he drove
to the Bixel Street turf

28:24.771 --> 28:26.005
and was transported

28:26.038 --> 28:27.273
to where we found him
some other way.

28:27.306 --> 28:30.910
Thus making one of those
two pieces of data skewed.

28:31.944 --> 28:32.611
So...

28:32.644 --> 28:34.781
I ran two different analyses.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.283
I gave probability scores
to the areas

28:37.316 --> 28:39.351
that Everett was most likely
headed to.

28:39.385 --> 28:40.853
Now, this first map

28:40.887 --> 28:43.122
assumes that he was headed
to where his body was found,

28:43.155 --> 28:44.924
to the 18 Street
Mexicali territory,

28:44.957 --> 28:47.827
making this his most likely
next destination.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.695
All right, and if he drove
to Bixel turf?

28:49.728 --> 28:52.865
Then Everett was most likely
headed here,

28:52.899 --> 28:54.266
by a more
efficient path.

28:58.805 --> 29:00.272
Do you see something?

29:00.306 --> 29:01.307
Well, back in 1990,

29:01.340 --> 29:05.244
Internal Affairs had their
headquarters right here.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.546
Internal Affairs?

29:07.579 --> 29:08.981
Why would he be headed there?

29:17.556 --> 29:18.024
DAVID:
Charlie's right.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.026
Everett was on his way
to Internal Affairs

29:20.059 --> 29:21.794
and he was killed
before he got there.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.863
Yeah, that ain't
a coincidence-- no way.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.898
DAVID: Okay, so why was he
on his way to IA?

29:25.932 --> 29:27.499
Well, Everett shot
Stephon Bradley.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.135
- Right?
DAVID: Yeah.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.903
But a shooting board ruled it
as a good kill.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.205
Yeah, they did, only IA
was taking another look.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.974
Yeah, why's that?

29:35.007 --> 29:36.508
Well, three days
before Everett shot him,

29:36.542 --> 29:37.709
Stephon Bradley
was picked up

29:37.743 --> 29:39.311
by Homicide.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.180
He was wanted
for a series of murders.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.949
He was taking down rival
gangs' stash houses

29:42.982 --> 29:44.383
and killing everyone inside.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.052
And he offered

29:46.085 --> 29:47.653
to trade information
against dirty cops.

29:47.686 --> 29:49.188
Was he dirty, Gary?

29:49.221 --> 29:50.689
No.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.091
I don't believe that.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.393
What were the circumstances
of the killing?

29:54.426 --> 29:58.364
We got a tip that Bradley had
committed a double murder.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.032
We found him
at his girlfriend's house.

30:00.066 --> 30:02.801
Everett covered the back,
Bradley tried to bolt for it.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.103
Everett shot him.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.438
Starting to smell
like a bad kill.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.240
LIZ:
All right, so...

30:08.274 --> 30:11.243
Everett was headed
to Internal Affairs to confess,

30:11.277 --> 30:14.513
and he stopped in the BSF
territory on the way.

30:14.546 --> 30:15.781
Why?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.716
Well, a cop with a
guilty conscience,

30:17.749 --> 30:19.986
he might wanna come
clean to the, uh...

30:20.019 --> 30:24.023
the brother of the guy that
he killed before he went to IA.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.358
You saying that Everett went
to see Calvin Bradley?

30:26.392 --> 30:29.228
Walked into the arms of the one
man who wanted to see him dead.

30:33.099 --> 30:36.235
(engine revs, siren whoops)

30:36.268 --> 30:37.536
(tires screech)

30:40.306 --> 30:41.373
Calvin.

30:41.407 --> 30:42.942
How many times we gonna

30:42.975 --> 30:44.776
- go through this, fellas?
- Don't go wasting our time.

30:44.810 --> 30:47.046
We know you saw Everett
the day he disappeared.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.984
Okay, you wanna prove
you're a changed man, Calvin?

30:52.018 --> 30:54.887
How 'bout owning up
to what you did, finally, huh?

30:54.921 --> 30:57.356
I did ten years taking
responsibility, Lieutenant.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.157
What about you?

30:58.190 --> 30:59.458
I hadn't committed
any crimes.

30:59.491 --> 31:01.727
No, you had other
people do it for you.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.029
Wait, hold on, say what?

31:03.062 --> 31:04.563
DON:
What's that?

31:04.596 --> 31:05.697
You really want to know?

31:05.731 --> 31:07.366
Yeah, I really wanna know.

31:07.399 --> 31:10.202
All right, Everett did
come to see me that day.

31:10.236 --> 31:11.303
To apologize.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.139
All right, he wanted
me to understand

31:13.172 --> 31:15.007
what had gone down
with Stephon.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.009
Only he left
my house alive.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.044
You're a liar.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.511
And you don't
know any better.

31:19.545 --> 31:20.812
All right,
careful, hey.

31:20.846 --> 31:22.048
DON: What did Everett
say to you?

31:22.081 --> 31:25.317
17 years I been a suspect
and you want my help.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.355
The cops were giving
Stephon tips

31:29.388 --> 31:31.723
on the location of
Mexican dope houses.

31:31.757 --> 31:32.925
What?

31:32.959 --> 31:34.126
Stephon ripped them off

31:34.160 --> 31:35.694
while the cops
looked the other way.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.597
Then they killed him when he
wanted to tell the truth.

31:38.630 --> 31:42.168
Whatever my
brother was...

31:42.201 --> 31:44.236
you were the ones
that made him that way.

31:44.270 --> 31:45.304
Can I go now?

31:48.107 --> 31:49.976
What do you think, Gary?

31:51.910 --> 31:53.412
Yeah, get out of here.

31:53.445 --> 31:54.680
Get out of here.

31:54.713 --> 31:57.583
Yeah, well, you can ask but
I'm not giving you a deposition.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.251
No, not until I know more facts.

31:59.285 --> 32:00.852
(knocking on door)
- Yeah, come in.

32:00.886 --> 32:03.089
All right, if
that's your position

32:03.122 --> 32:04.323
you can talk to my lawyer.

32:04.356 --> 32:05.691
You got it.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.126
You know a good lawyer?

32:07.159 --> 32:08.494
I do. I know several.

32:08.527 --> 32:09.495
Good.
Alan.

32:09.528 --> 32:10.462
Geez...

32:10.496 --> 32:11.363
Come here.

32:11.397 --> 32:12.031
Huh?

32:12.064 --> 32:13.332
Come here. Come.

32:13.365 --> 32:16.602
Relax. Here. Sit.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.304
No, it's all right, breathe.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.172
(sighs)
Relax.

32:20.206 --> 32:21.373
All right,
it's gonna be fine.

32:21.407 --> 32:22.841
All right,
we are gonna tackle

32:22.874 --> 32:24.176
each problem, one at a time.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.078
Albert Einstein said that?

32:26.112 --> 32:28.247
No, I read it on the back
of an iced tea bottle.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.083
- Oh.
- It still applies.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.751
You know what I did?

32:32.784 --> 32:37.023
I simulated your design
on the CAD program at CalSci.

32:37.056 --> 32:41.160
Well, I thought things like this
were, uh, frowned upon

32:41.193 --> 32:42.761
by certain administrators.

32:42.794 --> 32:43.862
So I'm busted.

32:43.895 --> 32:45.664
But who's gonna tell on me?
Me?

32:45.697 --> 32:47.033
(chuckles)

32:47.066 --> 32:50.002
Well, if that
million-dollar computer

32:50.036 --> 32:52.204
of yours is, uh, correct...

32:52.238 --> 32:54.340
There's no way that that
driving range can be as bright

32:54.373 --> 32:55.507
as the plaintiffs claim it is.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.476
I know, but the measure
of foot-candles

32:57.509 --> 32:58.744
is just off the charts.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.112
So, I, it, it...

33:00.146 --> 33:01.247
it doesn't...

33:01.280 --> 33:04.216
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.984
I know what this means.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.153
MILLIE:
The hue

33:07.186 --> 33:08.254
of the polypropylene is wrong.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.989
They didn't use the synthetic
grass that I specified.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.591
The contractor uses
a cheaper material

33:12.624 --> 33:14.393
- which reflects...
- Which reflects more light!

33:14.426 --> 33:16.695
See?!

33:16.728 --> 33:18.297
Well, I'm off the hook.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.532
Except for you electric bill
is gonna go through the roof.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.134
Oh, that's all right.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.002
Charlie owns the place now.

33:24.036 --> 33:25.571
(both laugh)

33:28.307 --> 33:30.309
MEGAN: So the police were
using Stephon Bradley

33:30.342 --> 33:32.211
to take down Mexican drug gangs?

33:32.244 --> 33:33.945
No way Everett was
a part of that.

33:33.979 --> 33:35.181
Then why did Everett
go see Bradley's brother

33:35.214 --> 33:36.582
- to apologize?
- Easy.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.417
Just saying, how long
we gonna live in denial here?

33:38.450 --> 33:40.052
MEGAN: Okay, well,
let's look at

33:40.086 --> 33:41.253
what Bradley's saying.

33:41.287 --> 33:43.322
If what he's saying is true,
then someone had to be

33:43.355 --> 33:45.023
telling the cops
where the locations

33:45.057 --> 33:46.625
for these houses were
to begin with, right?

33:46.658 --> 33:48.327
Well, if we find that source...

33:48.360 --> 33:50.862
Maybe he can point us in the
direction of Everett's killer.

33:50.896 --> 33:52.364
Okay, so let's take a look.

33:52.398 --> 33:53.599
These are
the gang territories

33:53.632 --> 33:55.067
where Calvin Bradley's
brother ripped off

33:55.101 --> 33:56.902
those drug houses,
and they're spread

33:56.935 --> 33:59.805
all through Mexican
gang territory,

33:59.838 --> 34:01.273
except for one.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.075
DAVID:
18 Street Mexicali.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.076
Which is
the same territory

34:04.110 --> 34:06.178
where Everett's body
was found.

34:06.212 --> 34:08.247
Okay, so why'd these guys
get a free ride?

34:09.148 --> 34:10.082
What it means

34:10.116 --> 34:11.450
is that whoever
was feeding them

34:11.483 --> 34:13.452
information was
18 Street Mexicali.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.053
And he didn't want
to snitch on his...

34:15.087 --> 34:17.055
on his own gang.

34:17.089 --> 34:19.057
Jimmy Lopez.

34:28.033 --> 34:29.000
Where's Jimmy Lopez?

34:29.034 --> 34:30.669
MAN: I wish you
could tell me.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.971
Took off. Haven't seen him.

34:33.004 --> 34:34.973
Where's his rig?

34:35.006 --> 34:37.109
Around the corner.

34:43.515 --> 34:44.650
That's it.

34:56.895 --> 34:57.863
That's weird.

35:16.815 --> 35:19.318
WALKER:
Jimmy Lopez.

35:19.351 --> 35:22.421
Been keeping a secret
from me for 17 years.

35:38.970 --> 35:39.938
Just doesn't add up.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.540
Lopez was clean for years.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.842
You think the pressure
of being questioned by you guys

35:43.875 --> 35:44.910
pushed him over the edge?

35:44.943 --> 35:46.645
Or someone else did.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.680
The tip of the needle is
broken off in his arm.

35:48.714 --> 35:49.848
Really?

35:49.881 --> 35:51.717
DON:
What, like he fought back?

35:51.750 --> 35:54.753
DAVID: Toxicology report shows
a mixture of heroin, strychnine

35:54.786 --> 35:57.756
- and powdered milk.
- Nice little cocktail.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.258
- What are you thinking?
- Most drug dealers

35:59.291 --> 36:01.427
are very consistent
in the way they cut their drugs.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.728
WALKER: That's true--
signature,

36:02.761 --> 36:04.996
brand-- helps them
sell it on the street.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.532
Maybe we get
a tox report

36:06.565 --> 36:08.800
from Lopez's OD
over to Charlie.

36:08.834 --> 36:09.901
MEGAN:
He can compare the drugs

36:09.935 --> 36:11.403
in Lopez's system

36:11.437 --> 36:13.272
to the other ODs in
the coroner's database?

36:13.305 --> 36:14.406
Sure, go for it.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.574
It's worth a shot, right?

36:23.181 --> 36:25.551
Statistical
identification?

36:25.584 --> 36:26.752
Right.

36:26.785 --> 36:29.321
Just looking at toxicology
records of recent ODs.

36:29.355 --> 36:30.656
I'm trying to match

36:30.689 --> 36:33.892
a specific drug
combo to a dealer.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.027
Strychnine-- that's poison.

36:36.061 --> 36:37.095
It's a trace dose.

36:37.128 --> 36:38.264
It's not enough to kill.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.699
You know, dealers put it
in their heroin mixes.

36:40.732 --> 36:41.700
Poison plus heroin.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.770
Yeah. A witness who identified
our cop killer OD'd,

36:44.803 --> 36:48.407
so I'm just trying to
trace the drug supply.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.710
What's happening
with the committee?

36:51.743 --> 36:52.544
(sighs)

36:52.578 --> 36:56.081
Some of the faculty
are demanding, but...

36:56.114 --> 36:57.916
I think I'm up for the job.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.285
I never doubted it.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.486
What are you working on?

37:00.519 --> 37:01.853
Uh, Millie has me
working on

37:01.887 --> 37:04.790
some cluster analysis using
autocorrelation techniques

37:04.823 --> 37:07.826
to analyze the most effective
undergrad classes

37:07.859 --> 37:08.760
in the past two years.

37:08.794 --> 37:11.363
Even going through
the past two semesters

37:11.397 --> 37:12.931
would be a ton of work.

37:12.964 --> 37:14.466
Yeah.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.001
Millie thinks there's
as much to be learned

37:16.034 --> 37:17.936
from the old curriculum
as the current.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.874
What is it?

37:23.875 --> 37:24.843
You know what?

37:24.876 --> 37:25.844
Can we talk later?

37:25.877 --> 37:26.945
- I got to go.
- Okay.

37:26.978 --> 37:29.281
We got LAPD looking up
all his known associates.

37:29.315 --> 37:30.382
CHARLIE:
Hey.

37:30.416 --> 37:31.917
So I ran the drugs
in Jimmy Lopez's system

37:31.950 --> 37:34.052
against all the recent ODs
in the coroner's office, right?

37:34.085 --> 37:34.920
DON:
Yeah, and?

37:34.953 --> 37:36.755
There were no matches
to any current dealers,

37:36.788 --> 37:38.424
which is why I re-ran
every overdose

37:38.457 --> 37:39.458
in the coroner's
database,

37:39.491 --> 37:42.027
including old overdoses,
and I got a hit--

37:42.060 --> 37:43.962
several hits,
actually.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.230
Three overdoses going back

37:45.263 --> 37:47.165
over a year,
all tracing back

37:47.198 --> 37:49.668
to a drug dealer
named Hector Osorio.

37:49.701 --> 37:50.902
(typing)

37:50.936 --> 37:54.072
MEGAN:
Uh, Osorio was busted

37:54.105 --> 37:56.708
by Lieutenant Davidson's
narco team.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.043
A large quantity

37:58.076 --> 37:59.277
of drugs were seized.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.315
Which would be
in the evidence room.

38:04.916 --> 38:08.520
And who would have
access to those drugs?

38:09.688 --> 38:12.891
The lead detective of the team.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.760
My guy Davidson.

38:18.063 --> 38:20.966
DAVIDSON:
Hey, Walker, what's up?

38:20.999 --> 38:22.501
You guys got any news?

38:23.735 --> 38:24.936
What the hell's wrong with you?

38:26.137 --> 38:27.138
DON:
All right, all right!

38:27.172 --> 38:28.407
You're under arrest
for the murder of

38:28.440 --> 38:29.408
John Everett.

38:29.441 --> 38:30.709
What are you
talking about?

38:30.742 --> 38:33.178
They traced the drugs
in Lopez's system to a bust

38:33.211 --> 38:34.279
that your team made, huh?

38:34.312 --> 38:35.847
So what?

38:35.881 --> 38:38.884
Yeah, that means that you
poisoned Lopez with those drugs.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.185
- Tell me the truth.
- You got nothing.

38:40.218 --> 38:41.286
You don't got jack on me.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.522
(shouting)

38:43.555 --> 38:45.123
- How could you do that?!
- All right, get off!

38:45.156 --> 38:46.191
- You ate at Everett's table!
- Hey!

38:46.224 --> 38:48.360
You helped raise
his son!

38:48.394 --> 38:50.028
Gary, cut it out!
Back off!

38:50.061 --> 38:51.029
This isn't helping! Turn around!

38:51.062 --> 38:52.230
Get your hands
behind your back!

38:52.263 --> 38:53.131
We never took a dime.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.300
I made the
streets safer.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.735
Every drug dealer that
Bradley whacked...

38:56.768 --> 38:57.836
- I don't believe you!
- No!

38:57.869 --> 38:59.738
Not one drug dealer
Bradley whacked

38:59.771 --> 39:01.407
ever killed another kid
with junk!

39:01.440 --> 39:02.508
You got that?!

39:02.541 --> 39:04.376
- I made the streets safer!
- So when Everett

39:04.410 --> 39:06.244
was about to rat you out,
you killed him.

39:06.277 --> 39:07.546
Because he had it coming!

39:07.579 --> 39:09.147
- You set him up
- All right, all right.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.148
to take the shot.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.216
Let me just see him
for one second.

39:11.249 --> 39:12.217
He was gonna go to IA!

39:12.250 --> 39:13.619
Let me just...
Give me that.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.787
Get this piece of crap away from
me. Get him away.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.923
He wouldn't listen
to reason! Hey, Walker!

39:17.956 --> 39:19.925
Walker, I had no choice!

39:19.958 --> 39:20.859
(door closes)

39:27.399 --> 39:28.366
Hey, Dad.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.701
Hey, Charlie.

39:29.735 --> 39:30.502
What?

39:30.536 --> 39:31.803
No plans with Amita tonight?

39:31.837 --> 39:35.173
She's busy
chairing a new committee.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.708
I guess...

39:36.742 --> 39:38.844
Millie found
the magic bullet, huh?

39:38.877 --> 39:40.912
Yeah, they dropped me
from the lawsuit.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.481
Contractor's
on the hot seat now.

39:42.514 --> 39:43.882
Oh, good. Well, I'm glad
she could help.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.752
You know, if you would've
needed my help,

39:46.785 --> 39:49.020
I certainly would've
been there for you.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.922
Oh, yeah, I
know, I know.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.691
Oh, by the way, Charlie,
when I hooked up

39:52.724 --> 39:55.026
all these lights, I may have
blown a circuit or two.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.027
A circuit or two?

39:56.061 --> 39:57.028
- Where?
- Yeah.

39:57.062 --> 39:57.863
I hope you had
the system

39:57.896 --> 39:59.230
backed up with
that laptop of yours

39:59.264 --> 40:00.098
in the garage.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.099
Ah-ah-ah!

40:01.132 --> 40:03.268
(chuckles)

40:03.301 --> 40:04.736
I was just kidding.

40:04.770 --> 40:07.639
(slow, mellow jazz playing)

40:14.613 --> 40:16.682
Hey.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.249
So...

40:18.283 --> 40:19.618
what's going on?

40:19.651 --> 40:22.387
I'm worried
about you.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.222
Ah, I'm all right.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.791
I mean, you know,

40:25.824 --> 40:27.392
- did I do something to...
- No, no, no.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.127
Liz, it's not about you.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.563
- I mean...
- Okay.

40:31.597 --> 40:34.099
You can't just get me going
and disappear.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.167
Yeah, I know.
I just...

40:36.201 --> 40:37.536
I feel like

40:37.569 --> 40:39.638
I keep second-guessing
so many moves.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.640
Mid-life crisis, huh?

40:41.673 --> 40:43.174
Ha, ha.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.979
Anyone see you come in here?

40:48.013 --> 40:49.014
Listen to you.

41:20.946 --> 41:22.648
Hey.

41:25.751 --> 41:26.785
Hey.

41:28.687 --> 41:31.590
I got plenty
in the bottle here.

41:31.623 --> 41:32.891
I can see that.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.226
300 bucks.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.227
He'd have
appreciate it.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.498
Hey, Gary, there was nothing
you could've done.

41:40.532 --> 41:42.400
I mean, look, I know that

41:42.433 --> 41:43.735
and you know that.

41:43.769 --> 41:46.004
We'd both be lying to ourselves
if we said that, Eppes.

41:47.539 --> 41:50.676
17 years.

41:50.709 --> 41:53.244
It was right there
under my nose.

41:55.446 --> 41:56.615
I just couldn't see it.

42:00.552 --> 42:01.787
He was a funny kid.

42:01.820 --> 42:05.156
He always walked around with
this goofy grin.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.157
I remember he had

42:06.191 --> 42:08.894
this little red radio
that he used to play,

42:08.927 --> 42:12.964
and there was one song that
he really liked to listen to,

42:12.998 --> 42:14.833
and I...

42:14.866 --> 42:17.803
I just haven't been able
to remember that song.

42:17.836 --> 42:19.838
I wish I could
remember that song.

42:19.871 --> 42:22.874
Wasn't it you that said,
"At the end of the day,

42:22.908 --> 42:24.776
you go home safe,
that's all you can ask"?

42:24.810 --> 42:26.177
That's right, Eppes.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.479
You...

42:28.513 --> 42:31.817
You walk away...
it all works out.

42:31.850 --> 42:33.919
("Summer of '69" fading in)

42:33.952 --> 42:37.122
* And now the times
are changin' *

42:37.155 --> 42:40.592
* Look at everything
that's come and gone *

42:40.626 --> 42:43.729
* Sometimes when I play
that ol' six-string *

42:43.762 --> 42:46.865
* Think about you
wonderin' what went wrong *

42:46.898 --> 42:50.902
* Standin' on
your mama's porch *

42:50.936 --> 42:54.072
* You told me
it'd last forever *

42:54.105 --> 42:57.743
* Oh, the way
you held my hand *

42:57.776 --> 43:01.146
* I knew that it was
now or never *

43:01.179 --> 43:05.350
* Those were
the best days of my life *

43:07.385 --> 43:09.821
* Oh, yeah

43:09.855 --> 43:10.255
* Back in the summer
of '69... *
