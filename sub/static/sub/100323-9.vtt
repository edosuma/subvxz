00:20.022 --> 00:23.413
_

00:28.174 --> 00:29.350
Everett Lynch.

00:29.602 --> 00:32.482
The media has christened
him "The Chameleon."

00:32.491 --> 00:35.625
He is a con man and a
murderer, who has targeted

00:35.627 --> 00:39.029
vulnerable middle-aged
women, single mothers.

00:39.031 --> 00:42.999
He's cut off their faces and
kept them as his trophies.

00:43.001 --> 00:46.036
A year ago, we nearly caught
him, but his daughter Grace...

00:46.038 --> 00:47.070
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:47.072 --> 00:48.572
She sacrificed herself

00:48.574 --> 00:50.340
so that he could get away.

00:50.342 --> 00:54.010
He broke Grace out of jail...

00:54.012 --> 00:55.178
And again...

00:55.180 --> 00:57.247
- Don't move.
- We almost caught him,

00:57.249 --> 00:58.882
if it hadn't been for his daughter.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.852
She'd do anything for him.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.453
But that wouldn't matter because Lynch

01:04.456 --> 01:08.024
couldn't bring himself
to take Grace with him.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.861
Maybe he couldn't bring
himself to keep using her

01:10.863 --> 01:13.997
the way his mother
Roberta had once used him.

01:13.999 --> 01:15.198
Oh, god!

01:15.200 --> 01:17.601
Everett Lynch remains at large.

01:17.603 --> 01:20.637
He is the FBI's most wanted,

01:20.639 --> 01:25.375
but there hasn't been any
sign of him for months.

01:29.081 --> 01:31.047
Hey. What's up?

01:31.049 --> 01:33.550
So I wanted you to be the first to know

01:33.552 --> 01:36.386
that my name is on a
short list of candidates

01:36.388 --> 01:38.588
being considered to fill
the director's chair.

01:38.590 --> 01:41.458
Emily, that's incredible.

01:41.460 --> 01:43.560
Oh, my... God.

01:43.562 --> 01:46.396
You're gonna be the
next director of the FBI.

01:46.398 --> 01:49.366
That still remains a definite maybe.

01:49.368 --> 01:52.702
Oh. â€­But I do know
that I want the job.

01:52.704 --> 01:56.740
But I would feel much better if
my first directive as Director

01:56.742 --> 01:59.643
was to appoint you
Unit Chief of the BAU.

01:59.645 --> 02:04.214
And I... I told you before,
that really does mean a lot.

02:04.216 --> 02:06.750
Enough to turn down being
special agent in charge

02:06.752 --> 02:08.952
of the New Orleans field office?

02:08.954 --> 02:12.255
Um... I'm not sure.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.778
Now I feel like I'm...

02:13.778 --> 02:15.802
I'm pressuring you into
staying, and that's not what I...

02:15.894 --> 02:19.763
Oh, no, no, no, see, and I'm feeling
like if I do go to New Orleans,

02:19.765 --> 02:21.932
you might not decide to make history

02:21.934 --> 02:23.900
as the first female head of the FBI.

02:23.902 --> 02:26.403
Oh, no, it's... Don't worry.

02:26.405 --> 02:29.339
If given the chance, I'm making history.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.912
The truth is, I don't think Lisa

02:35.914 --> 02:37.914
ever got over what happened to Phil.

02:37.916 --> 02:40.583
I mean, how could she, really?

02:40.585 --> 02:42.285
I'm so sorry, Luke.

02:42.287 --> 02:45.088
Lisa and I'll still be
friends, I mean, you know.

02:45.090 --> 02:48.091
We were always honest with each other.

02:48.093 --> 02:51.061
So, unfortunately, Rossi
can't make it tonight,

02:51.063 --> 02:54.597
but JJ just texted to say that she and
Emily are on their way over right now.

02:54.599 --> 02:56.566
Great, and thanks for hosting, Spence.

02:56.568 --> 02:59.102
Well, thank you for coming. I'm
embarrassed that it's taken me this long

02:59.104 --> 03:01.504
to have you guys over
to my house to hang out.

03:01.506 --> 03:04.507
Guys, I have something to say.

03:04.509 --> 03:07.510
An opportunity has
presented itself to me,

03:07.512 --> 03:11.081
and it is in the Silicon Valley.

03:14.519 --> 03:16.486
Global Stratagem Development.

03:16.488 --> 03:19.856
They're a private research group
that's expanding their stratagem

03:19.858 --> 03:23.360
to include combating
global environmental change.

03:23.362 --> 03:26.563
Wow, that sounds perfect for you.

03:26.565 --> 03:28.999
You get to do all the
good work you do at the BAU

03:29.001 --> 03:30.767
- without the gore.
- Yeah,

03:30.769 --> 03:33.636
ok, but... Are you
trying to get rid of me?

03:33.638 --> 03:35.305
No.

03:35.307 --> 03:37.173
I don't want anybody going anywhere.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.409
Right, and I don't want to go anywhere.

03:39.411 --> 03:42.145
I love... I mean, this
is my home. Not this room,

03:42.147 --> 03:44.848
but, you know, the BAU is

03:44.850 --> 03:47.350
and... Come on.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.419
We're family.

03:49.421 --> 03:51.421
Yeah,

03:51.423 --> 03:53.356
we're family,

03:53.358 --> 03:55.892
and our relationship to
each other is not bound

03:55.894 --> 03:57.861
by wherever we show up to go to work.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.497
If you have the opportunity
to do something you love,

04:00.499 --> 04:03.333
Penelope, you should
absolutely explore it.

04:08.507 --> 04:12.108
You know why you lasted longer
in this job than I ever did?

04:12.110 --> 04:16.478
You never really let the
unsub get inside your head.

04:17.749 --> 04:20.784
Is that your way of saying
you were better than me, Jason?

04:20.786 --> 04:23.520
You tell me. I'm inside your head.

04:23.522 --> 04:25.722
I'm the unsub.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.891
What do I want?

04:27.893 --> 04:30.593
You know, I never liked your games.

04:30.595 --> 04:32.562
I know. Remember?

04:32.564 --> 04:35.365
You and me? My yin to your yang?

04:35.367 --> 04:37.700
We were like Martin and Lewis.

04:37.702 --> 04:39.669
Forget the unsub. What do you want?

04:39.671 --> 04:41.704
I want you to ask yourself
that fundamental question

04:41.706 --> 04:43.940
that's been nagging
at you this whole time.

04:43.942 --> 04:45.442
I already answered it.

04:45.444 --> 04:47.410
I'm the unsub.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.280
Why didn't I kill you
when I had the chance?

04:56.588 --> 05:00.957
You kill me, you killed a federal
agent, and that brings down...

05:00.959 --> 05:03.460
That's the wrong answer.

05:03.462 --> 05:06.696
You'd never been in
that situation before.

05:06.698 --> 05:09.232
He had you on the ground,

05:09.234 --> 05:11.201
knife to your face.

05:11.203 --> 05:13.870
You resigned yourself
to the thought of dying.

05:13.872 --> 05:16.372
It scared the hell out of me.

05:16.374 --> 05:19.342
Everett Lynch didn't kill you

05:19.344 --> 05:22.312
because he looked in your
eyes and saw something

05:22.314 --> 05:24.280
of his father.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.784
Sons kill their fathers, Jason.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.919
Sure, they do, but not typically

05:29.921 --> 05:32.055
if they still have issues to work out.

05:32.057 --> 05:34.057
Lynch's dad is dead.

05:34.059 --> 05:37.060
His name was Douglas Moore.
He was an insurance man.

05:37.062 --> 05:39.229
Lynch's mother was trying to grift him

05:39.231 --> 05:41.397
and got careless and got pregnant.

05:41.399 --> 05:44.434
The guy drowned in a boating accident.

05:44.436 --> 05:46.870
Drowned, huh?

05:46.872 --> 05:49.873
Kind of like how Lynch would
describe Grace drowning.

05:49.875 --> 05:53.943
Oh, look, the Moore story checked out,

05:53.945 --> 05:57.113
unless...

05:59.451 --> 06:02.352
Roberta lied to me...

06:02.354 --> 06:06.523
And if she lied to me, she
probably lied to her son,

06:06.525 --> 06:10.226
and if he found out, he'd
want to find his father,

06:10.228 --> 06:12.695
don't you think?

06:25.510 --> 06:28.278
I need you to find my father.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.214
You start by tracking down these names.

06:33.985 --> 06:35.985
Consider it done,

06:35.987 --> 06:38.188
Mr. Myles.

06:49.467 --> 06:51.467
- Marilyn?
- Eddie,

06:51.469 --> 06:53.636
I need you. It's Jimmy. He, um,

06:53.638 --> 06:55.505
he... he hit me again, and I...

06:55.507 --> 06:57.340
Slow down. Where are you?

06:57.342 --> 07:00.009
Olivia and I are on our way to a motel,

07:00.011 --> 07:02.545
but I... I was just wondering

07:02.547 --> 07:07.684
if maybe the offer was still
good for us to move in together?

07:09.054 --> 07:11.020
- Uh, well...
- I know.

07:11.022 --> 07:14.157
I should... I should have never left
you hanging and gone back to him...

07:14.159 --> 07:17.293
It's not that. It's just I'm
out of town. I get back tomorrow.

07:17.295 --> 07:21.130
All right, so...

07:21.132 --> 07:23.833
So I'll come by and pick up you and
Olivia sometime tomorrow afternoon.

07:23.835 --> 07:26.402
Thanks, baby.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.404
I owe you.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.406
Bye.

07:38.283 --> 07:41.317
You have the most
remarkable facial structure.

07:41.319 --> 07:43.720
Has anyone ever told you that?

09:19.792 --> 09:23.794
They know they can
survive." Josephine Hart.

09:36.544 --> 09:38.112
I don't know why it didn't
occur to me yesterday

09:38.112 --> 09:40.813
that you'd come down here to recharge.

09:44.425 --> 09:46.438
It's been a year since we
first encountered Lynch.

09:46.611 --> 09:48.811
Yeah, I'll probably forget
my wedding anniversary,

09:48.813 --> 09:51.513
but I'll never forget that day.

09:53.317 --> 09:56.285
And this is where the BAU began.

09:56.287 --> 09:59.555
It's the one place I can
still hear Gideon's voice

09:59.557 --> 10:04.560
prodding me to, um,
"think outside the box."

10:04.562 --> 10:08.330
Something like, uh, "I am the unsub."

10:08.332 --> 10:10.432
"Who's my daddy?"

10:11.736 --> 10:13.736
That's what we've been missing.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.372
- Roberta gave us the name...
- Roberta lied.

10:16.374 --> 10:17.659
She just wants to appear

10:17.659 --> 10:19.659
to be helpful to everybody.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.160
She's got her own agenda.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.995
What are you thinking...
Get paroled, find her son,

10:22.997 --> 10:24.964
and get revenge for the death
of her granddaughter Grace?

10:24.966 --> 10:26.399
The trifecta.

10:26.401 --> 10:29.068
Killing her own child is far more
common than most people think,

10:29.070 --> 10:32.638
and in filicide cases, mothers are
just as likely as fathers to be killers.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.174
Which is why Roberta doesn't
want us to get in the way

10:35.176 --> 10:37.643
of her taking care of family business.

10:37.645 --> 10:41.514
Still, filicide not only requires
that she harbor deep resentment,

10:41.516 --> 10:43.916
but also that she disassociates

10:43.916 --> 10:45.882
from her relationship to her only child.

10:45.884 --> 10:49.353
Which she did when I showed her
the photo of Grace's dead body.

10:49.355 --> 10:52.222
Were you gonna share all this
with the rest of the team?

10:52.224 --> 10:54.458
It's just theories.

10:55.943 --> 10:58.244
Dave, I completely understand

10:58.246 --> 11:01.747
your personal stake in this,
but you and Gideon started

11:01.749 --> 11:05.751
something pretty good down
here, and I think it's time

11:05.753 --> 11:09.321
that you let that legacy do
what it's always done best...

11:09.323 --> 11:11.624
Work together as a team.

11:38.052 --> 11:40.719
Oh. Oh, wow.

11:40.721 --> 11:43.222
- What do you think?
- â€­Oh, my gosh!

11:43.224 --> 11:44.723
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

11:44.725 --> 11:47.226
Thank you, thank you. Mwah! Thank you.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.295
Yeah. You are truly a godsend.

11:49.297 --> 11:50.829
Well, I rearranged some
things inside the way I think

11:50.831 --> 11:52.431
you might like them. You
should go check them out.

11:52.433 --> 11:54.900
Ok. Great. Olivia,

11:54.902 --> 11:57.002
let Eddie help you with that.

11:57.004 --> 11:58.871
Here, let me get this for you.

11:58.873 --> 12:01.073
No. I can handle my own stuff.

12:03.544 --> 12:05.010
Sorry.

12:05.012 --> 12:07.012
Hey, don't be. I get it.

12:07.014 --> 12:09.448
This can't be easy for you.

12:09.450 --> 12:11.951
Yeah. Mom's been a lot worse, so...

12:11.953 --> 12:13.953
Maybe this can be, like, a chance

12:13.955 --> 12:16.855
at a fresh start? I don't know. Maybe?

12:16.857 --> 12:19.825
You mind telling me something?

12:19.827 --> 12:21.560
Ok.

12:21.562 --> 12:23.696
What do you see in her?

12:25.032 --> 12:27.700
I see a sparkle

12:27.702 --> 12:30.469
that's trying real hard to shine bright.

12:30.471 --> 12:32.938
I wish I could see that.

12:32.940 --> 12:34.707
Oh, you will.

12:34.709 --> 12:37.910
So, can I please help you
with some of this stuff?

12:37.912 --> 12:41.113
Ok.

12:48.622 --> 12:51.156
So, Rossi gave me the heads-up,

12:51.158 --> 12:53.325
and I was able to find
stuff that confirms

12:53.327 --> 12:55.761
our very own silver fox's theory

12:55.763 --> 12:59.598
that Everett Lynch is on the
lookout for his long-lost father.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.101
You see, in all of the cities

13:02.103 --> 13:04.770
that Lynch has committed
a heinous crime, I have

13:04.772 --> 13:08.273
uncovered an alias linked
to a wired payment to a P.I.

13:08.275 --> 13:11.443
who was retained to conduct
searches for men we know were

13:11.445 --> 13:14.613
associated in a naked way
with Lynch's mother, Roberta.

13:14.615 --> 13:17.783
Including Douglas Moore, the man
she claims is Lynch's real dad.

13:17.785 --> 13:20.786
But all these searches are recent,
like within the last 8 weeks.

13:20.788 --> 13:23.956
Yeah, it looks as though they began
a week after we found Grace's body.

13:23.958 --> 13:26.992
It's fascinating. He might not
be a complete sociopath after all.

13:26.994 --> 13:29.128
It could also explain his dormancy.

13:29.130 --> 13:31.764
Wait a second, Spence. You don't
think he feels guilty, do you?

13:31.766 --> 13:34.733
Not guilt. I think it's
more like fear, as if maybe

13:34.735 --> 13:36.447
something in the act of taking his child

13:36.447 --> 13:37.714
triggered some deeply buried memory

13:37.938 --> 13:39.905
of his own father's
violence towards himself.

13:39.907 --> 13:42.908
If Lynch never really
knew who his father was,

13:42.910 --> 13:45.077
or if he had reason to
doubt what Roberta told him,

13:45.079 --> 13:46.698
then that would motivate
him to search for the truth.

13:46.698 --> 13:48.902
Well, there's only one person
we know that knows the whole

13:48.902 --> 13:50.970
truth, and that's
Roberta, and so she's been

13:50.970 --> 13:53.303
manipulating everything in
order to get out of jail.

13:53.305 --> 13:55.339
- Then...
- It worked, at least as far

13:55.341 --> 13:57.574
as the Louisiana state
parole board goes.

13:57.576 --> 14:00.611
I have just been notified
that, despite our objections,

14:00.613 --> 14:03.113
Roberta is being
granted parole, however,

14:03.115 --> 14:05.115
her lawyer is telling
me he's willing to let us

14:05.117 --> 14:06.917
speak with her one last time.

14:06.919 --> 14:08.885
Emily, I'd like to talk to Roberta.

14:08.887 --> 14:10.721
I would prefer you observe, actually;

14:10.723 --> 14:12.656
I'd like to take her
out of her comfort zone.

14:12.658 --> 14:15.759
That means JJ, Tara, you
two get to do the honors.

14:19.524 --> 14:21.591
Hello, Roberta.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.515
I'm SSA Jennifer Jareau.

14:24.468 --> 14:27.302
This is Dr. Tara Lewis.

14:28.505 --> 14:30.438
Remember him?

14:30.440 --> 14:32.808
Uh, Dr. Lewis, let me remind you

14:32.808 --> 14:35.309
that Ms. Lynch is here
of her own volition.

14:35.311 --> 14:38.045
I don't understand why you
are taking a tone with her.

14:38.047 --> 14:39.246
Tone?

14:39.248 --> 14:41.382
Your adversarial tone,

14:41.384 --> 14:43.384
when she has done nothing
but try to help you

14:43.386 --> 14:46.286
apprehend her very unstable son.

14:46.993 --> 14:50.208
Do either one of you have children?

14:50.397 --> 14:52.842
We're not here to talk
about our families.

14:53.405 --> 14:56.528
We're here because, while
the state of Louisiana

14:56.754 --> 15:00.823
believes you've been very
helpful in this investigation,

15:00.825 --> 15:02.825
we know the truth.

15:02.827 --> 15:06.829
The truth is that I'm
profoundly sorry for what

15:06.831 --> 15:10.399
my granddaughter Grace
did to you, Agent Jareau.

15:11.368 --> 15:14.203
But it is my sincere
belief that it was my son

15:14.205 --> 15:16.672
who really pulled that trigger.

15:17.538 --> 15:20.238
Look, we know you think
you're gonna get out of here

15:20.238 --> 15:23.072
and go punish your son
for what he did to Grace.

15:23.074 --> 15:25.441
And, I got to be honest with
you, there is a real side

15:25.443 --> 15:28.978
of me that's sayin', "you go, girl."

15:28.980 --> 15:31.481
You're the one that
brought him into this world,

15:31.483 --> 15:34.350
yeah, you should be the
one to take him out of it.

15:38.823 --> 15:41.824
But I'm an officer of the law,

15:42.443 --> 15:44.683
and it's my duty to see that justice

15:44.683 --> 15:48.452
is served here, not revenge.

15:49.755 --> 15:52.456
Ladies...

15:53.759 --> 15:56.193
As far as I'm concerned,

15:56.195 --> 15:59.897
my son is already dead to me.

16:01.233 --> 16:03.233
Damn, lady.

16:03.235 --> 16:05.202
You are good.

16:05.204 --> 16:08.906
Ok, I would say we are done here.

16:14.713 --> 16:18.348
Yeah, it looks like I got a solid
lead on this guy named Delvin Weaver.

16:18.350 --> 16:19.850
Oh, he wasn't on the
list that I gave you.

16:19.852 --> 16:21.318
Yeah, I know. I'm just that good.

16:21.320 --> 16:24.388
So he was supposedly just a
friend of a friend of your Roberta,

16:24.390 --> 16:26.390
but actually there was
a lot more than that.

16:26.392 --> 16:28.859
Anyway, Delvin was, like, the bad sheep

16:28.861 --> 16:31.161
of the wealthiest
mining family in Nevada.

16:31.163 --> 16:34.631
About 20 years ago, he beat a man
to death in a bar in west Wendover.

16:34.633 --> 16:37.868
So, sounds like the guy
we're looking for, am I right?

16:37.870 --> 16:39.703
Yeah. Where is he now?

16:39.705 --> 16:41.772
Yeah, I'm still working on
that. I'll get back to you. Ciao.

16:45.211 --> 16:47.978
Don't worry. Diabetes, not drugs.

16:51.584 --> 16:54.751
Ah, come to me, my pretty.

16:54.753 --> 16:56.687
Ok, I set up some digital tripwires

16:56.689 --> 16:59.723
for online searches and background
checks on any names associated

16:59.725 --> 17:01.892
with Everett or Grace or Roberta Lynch.

17:01.894 --> 17:03.894
And somebody just tripped...

17:03.896 --> 17:05.896
The light fantastic? They did, sir.

17:05.897 --> 17:08.999
Somebody has a keen interest
in Roberta Lynch's aliases.

17:09.001 --> 17:12.336
- Can you tell who that somebody is?
- I cannot yet,

17:12.338 --> 17:14.872
but I can tell you that the I.P.
address of our mysterious searcher

17:14.874 --> 17:17.340
is coming from... Reno, Nevada.

17:17.343 --> 17:21.578
So, it looks like some of us
are gonna be taking a field trip.

17:21.579 --> 17:23.747
Godspeed, sir.

18:10.429 --> 18:14.464
Do you see this? Can you
believe it? What'd I tell you?

18:14.466 --> 18:17.668
I mean, this has got
to be close to 70 grand.

18:17.670 --> 18:21.138
I'd say that's more than enough
to take us wherever we want.

18:23.175 --> 18:25.709
I told you we make a good team.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.214
Want me to tie up our loose end?

18:30.216 --> 18:32.115
Shh.

18:32.117 --> 18:34.618
Your girlfriend, Charlotte,

18:34.620 --> 18:36.787
did you love her?

18:38.090 --> 18:42.059
Yeah, I... I guess so. Why?

18:49.535 --> 18:51.468
Maybe you'll understand

18:51.470 --> 18:53.537
why I have to do this.

19:03.983 --> 19:06.250
You should never have been born.

19:06.252 --> 19:09.586
You should never have been born.

19:24.937 --> 19:27.604
Oh, ho ho ho...

19:47.777 --> 19:49.504
Fret not, my intrepid crime fighters.

19:49.504 --> 19:51.771
You're no longer flying
blind into the silver state.

19:51.771 --> 19:56.043
I have matched our mysterious searcher's
I.P. address to a business in Reno

19:56.043 --> 19:58.761
that touts itself as a
"private security firm,"

19:58.761 --> 20:01.261
and it's christened Castle Security.

20:01.263 --> 20:05.099
Says here the company is owned
and operated by Orlando Gaines.

20:05.101 --> 20:06.600
What a piece of work.

20:06.602 --> 20:09.069
He's a former Concord Bay narcotics cop

20:09.071 --> 20:12.606
who spent 5 years in prison for
selling police-confiscated drugs.

20:12.608 --> 20:14.608
It looks like 8 months
ago, his company received

20:14.610 --> 20:17.578
a wire transfer for $25,000
from an offshore account

20:17.580 --> 20:20.514
connected to our old
friend, Arthur Terrell.

20:20.516 --> 20:21.982
Terrell was still alive back then.

20:21.984 --> 20:24.184
He was, but that account
has since transferred

20:24.186 --> 20:26.520
into the hands of an Edward Myles,

20:26.522 --> 20:28.956
and Mr. Myles is turning
out to be very elusive.

20:28.958 --> 20:31.492
Yeah, 'cause although that
could be a very likely alias

20:31.494 --> 20:33.827
for Mr. Lynch, that name isn't
popping up anywhere in Reno.

20:33.829 --> 20:36.530
JJ, Luke, Matt, check in with Reno PD,

20:36.532 --> 20:38.465
also our FBI field office.

20:38.467 --> 20:42.036
Dave and Spence, see if you can
get a sit-down with Orlando Gaines.

21:06.796 --> 21:08.729
What do you got?

21:08.731 --> 21:12.266
Well, I got what looks like federal
agents poking around my business.

21:12.268 --> 21:14.201
Thanks for the heads-up.

21:14.203 --> 21:16.603
You're welcome, but I do
have something else for you...

21:16.605 --> 21:18.906
Home address for Delvin Weaver.

21:18.908 --> 21:22.476
Which means I have the rest of
your money waiting here for you.

21:22.478 --> 21:24.572
I'm on my way.

21:30.086 --> 21:32.186
You found a missing persons report?

21:32.188 --> 21:33.687
Coming across the wire now.

21:33.689 --> 21:35.689
Ok, Marilyn Irwin, 45 years old.

21:35.691 --> 21:37.858
Cocktail waitress at
the Tangiers in Reno.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.993
She has a 15-year-old
daughter, Olivia.

21:39.995 --> 21:42.329
Two days ago, Marilyn gets in this fight

21:42.331 --> 21:44.331
with her live-in abusive
boyfriend, then she calls her mom,

21:44.333 --> 21:46.366
and then she tells her mom she's
moving out and she's moving in

21:46.368 --> 21:47.868
with a guy named... Wait for it...

21:47.870 --> 21:50.704
Edward Myles, aka Everett Lynch.

21:50.706 --> 21:53.607
So Everett Lynch is no longer
dormant and he's escalating.

21:53.609 --> 21:55.776
Letter copy.

22:06.627 --> 22:09.261
Do you know where my mom went?

22:09.263 --> 22:11.668
Huh? Uh, no.

22:12.133 --> 22:13.687
I don't. Tried calling her?

22:13.732 --> 22:16.265
I would, but I can't find my phone.

22:16.267 --> 22:17.934
Hmm.

22:19.437 --> 22:22.138
Did you guys get into a fight?

22:26.444 --> 22:28.911
Yeah, yeah, we did.
I... I tried to stop her,

22:28.913 --> 22:30.913
but she hopped in her car
and she peeled out of here...

22:30.915 --> 22:33.449
Of course she did, because
that's what she does.

22:33.451 --> 22:35.952
She runs from boyfriend
to freaking boyfriend.

22:35.954 --> 22:38.721
- Couples, they fight...
- Eddie.

22:38.723 --> 22:42.492
Come on. Did you honestly believe
that you guys were, like, a couple?

22:44.796 --> 22:46.763
Hey, Olivia, if you
want, I got no problem

22:46.765 --> 22:49.032
taking you to your grandma's
place in Carson City.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.500
No.

22:50.502 --> 22:53.336
No, it's fine. I'll just wait here.

22:53.338 --> 22:56.205
She'll be coming back eventually.

22:56.207 --> 22:59.375
Ok. Yeah, sure.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.560
Hey, Delvin.

23:26.634 --> 23:27.957
Bobbie?

23:28.657 --> 23:30.157
Yep. Heh!

23:31.436 --> 23:34.171
Found myself passing
through, and so I got

23:34.171 --> 23:37.172
a little bit nostalgic, and...

23:37.174 --> 23:39.675
I just thought I'd come by,
see if you're still here.

23:39.677 --> 23:42.344
Been a long time.

23:42.346 --> 23:43.914
Yeah.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.383
Come on in.

23:57.328 --> 24:02.564
You know, I found this guy snoopin'
around my property this morning.

24:03.868 --> 24:08.003
Hmm, kinda looked like this P.I. type.

24:08.005 --> 24:11.407
Now he wasn't with you, was he?

24:11.855 --> 24:12.938
He was not.

24:13.072 --> 24:15.039
It's just awfully weird,

24:15.436 --> 24:19.137
you dropping in out
of the clear blue sky

24:19.139 --> 24:22.641
after... Like, 30 years,

24:22.643 --> 24:26.011
especially the way we... we ended it.

24:26.879 --> 24:28.041
That was not pretty.

24:28.236 --> 24:31.270
Yeah, well, what's done
is done, can't be undone,

24:31.272 --> 24:35.941
so nothin' I can say is
gonna change anything.

24:35.943 --> 24:37.510
What about your son?

24:37.512 --> 24:39.478
As far as I'm concerned,

24:39.480 --> 24:42.515
bringing him into this
world was your decision.

24:42.517 --> 24:44.404
It's not mine.

24:50.925 --> 24:54.126
You know, after we separated...

24:55.730 --> 24:59.932
I lied to the boy about
who his father was.

25:01.235 --> 25:05.438
But now I hear that
he knows the truth...

25:06.774 --> 25:08.874
And he's lookin' for you,

25:08.876 --> 25:11.010
wants to reconnect.

25:11.012 --> 25:13.145
I got nothin' to say to him.

25:13.147 --> 25:17.683
Your son has grown up to be
a real chip off the old block.

25:19.620 --> 25:22.054
He hurts women.

25:22.056 --> 25:24.457
He's even killed a few.

25:24.459 --> 25:26.759
Why are you telling
me all this, Bobbie?!

25:26.761 --> 25:29.161
'Cause every time I think about
it, I think about that night

25:29.163 --> 25:32.865
that you tried to drown
him in our bathtub,

25:32.867 --> 25:36.402
and I cannot stop hearing your voice,

25:36.404 --> 25:38.804
screamin'...

25:38.806 --> 25:42.608
"You should have never been born!"

25:42.610 --> 25:46.645
So it sounds like I was right, right?!

25:48.616 --> 25:51.517
You're a son of a bitch.

26:05.726 --> 26:08.227
Mr. Stinson, your misguided affection

26:08.229 --> 26:11.781
for Roberta Lynch has
driven you into a blind

26:11.781 --> 26:14.616
and inconceivably stupid loyalty.

26:14.618 --> 26:16.818
Apparently, after Roberta
took care of business,

26:16.820 --> 26:19.120
you were planning to rendezvous at the

26:19.122 --> 26:22.123
Zalvos resort in the Cayman Islands.

26:22.125 --> 26:25.126
We know Roberta skipped
out on her parole

26:25.128 --> 26:27.162
to catch up with her
son's biological father,

26:27.164 --> 26:29.164
and we know he lives
somewhere near Reno.

26:29.166 --> 26:32.467
We don't know his name, but you do.

26:33.470 --> 26:36.437
I do not have anything
to say to you today.

26:36.439 --> 26:40.141
I have no knowledge of Ms.
Lynch's current whereabouts.

26:41.444 --> 26:43.878
I'd say Roberta was definitely planning

26:43.880 --> 26:46.948
for her life after prison with you

26:46.950 --> 26:49.684
and with others.

26:49.686 --> 26:52.220
What are you talking about?

26:52.222 --> 26:53.855
Open it.

26:57.661 --> 27:00.628
Roberta solicited many male admirers

27:00.630 --> 27:03.164
with those... what are they
called again, boudoir photos?

27:03.166 --> 27:04.666
- Mm-hmm.
- â€­Mmm.

27:06.970 --> 27:09.871
She said she loved me.

27:11.208 --> 27:13.575
They always do.

27:14.878 --> 27:17.579
Who's Everett Lynch's father?

27:22.519 --> 27:25.887
His name is Delvin Weaver.

27:28.024 --> 27:30.491
That is what they call overkill.

27:30.493 --> 27:32.460
At least 14 gunshot wounds,

27:32.462 --> 27:35.196
which suggests the killer
reloaded, and then followed up

27:35.198 --> 27:36.664
with 47 stab wounds.

27:36.666 --> 27:38.633
Yeah, this is Roberta's handiwork.

27:38.635 --> 27:41.135
Doesn't take an expert to
recognize that all this violence

27:41.137 --> 27:43.905
is most likely rooted in her
own history of victimization.

27:43.907 --> 27:46.407
But the overall message?
That's for her son.

27:46.409 --> 27:48.409
He took away Grace from her,

27:48.411 --> 27:50.912
so she's taking away
his father from him.

27:50.914 --> 27:53.581
Basically denying whatever
answer he thought he

27:53.583 --> 27:56.551
might be able to salvage
from their reunion.

27:56.553 --> 27:58.553
But when Lynch finds out
about this, it'll just confirm

27:58.555 --> 28:01.256
what he already suspects about
his father's violent past,

28:01.258 --> 28:03.758
and that could help us
because if killing Grace

28:03.760 --> 28:05.727
did trigger some sort
of terrible memory,

28:05.729 --> 28:08.796
he might try to suppress whatever
urges make him feel like his dad.

28:08.798 --> 28:11.799
He might even try to
prove that to himself

28:11.801 --> 28:14.335
by fostering a surrogate for Grace,

28:14.337 --> 28:17.038
like Olivia Irwin.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.441
I'll check in with Luke and Matt.

28:29.719 --> 28:31.219
Rossi.

28:31.221 --> 28:33.321
Agent Rossi.

28:33.323 --> 28:34.922
Is my father dead?

28:34.924 --> 28:36.891
Yes, he is.

28:36.893 --> 28:38.926
Your mother killed him.

28:38.928 --> 28:40.428
My mother?

28:42.399 --> 28:44.899
She charmed her way out of jail,

28:44.901 --> 28:47.568
and now she's out for blood... yours.

28:47.570 --> 28:49.570
I'm sure she is. Listen,
I need to talk to you,

28:49.572 --> 28:51.773
face to face. â€­You tell me where

28:51.775 --> 28:54.776
I can find Marilyn and
Olivia, then we can talk.

28:54.778 --> 28:56.778
Marilyn's gone, but Olivia,

28:56.780 --> 28:59.514
she's somewhere safe, for now.

28:59.516 --> 29:00.982
All right.

29:00.984 --> 29:02.784
Jasper's Ridge in 30 minutes.

29:02.786 --> 29:06.788
Just you and me, and then maybe I'll
tell you where you can find Olivia.

29:09.659 --> 29:11.993
I can't believe we're
even considering this.

29:11.995 --> 29:14.295
We can't negotiate with a sociopath.

29:14.297 --> 29:17.465
I'm with JJ. It'll only
embolden his sense of power.

29:17.467 --> 29:19.467
It might, but Lynch is clearly

29:19.469 --> 29:21.436
in a very vulnerable
emotional state of mind,

29:21.438 --> 29:23.871
and that provides us with an
opportunity to manipulate him.

29:23.873 --> 29:26.307
- How so?
- We can give him hope,

29:26.309 --> 29:28.309
basically hope for redemption.

29:28.311 --> 29:30.278
Lynch knows that his impulses are wrong

29:30.280 --> 29:32.280
and that they make him just like
his father, and he hates that,

29:32.282 --> 29:34.816
so he's looking to a surrogate
father... in this case, Rossi...

29:34.818 --> 29:37.685
To tell him that he can overcome
his past and become a better man.

29:37.687 --> 29:39.187
Spence, you give him way too much credit

29:39.189 --> 29:41.155
for being able to feel human emotion.

29:41.157 --> 29:42.924
Well, I'm not sure about
his emotional vulnerability,

29:42.926 --> 29:44.959
but I do think we should try to
take advantage of what's going to be

29:44.961 --> 29:46.961
his physical vulnerability
on Jasper's Ridge.

29:46.963 --> 29:48.796
If he senses Dave's got back-up,

29:48.798 --> 29:50.598
the psychological games are over.

29:50.600 --> 29:53.634
And we still don't have one clue as
to where he's holding Olivia Irwin.

29:53.636 --> 29:55.203
I just think there's a way that we

29:55.205 --> 29:56.771
can get the best of both worlds here.

29:56.773 --> 29:59.207
Emily, what do you want?

29:59.209 --> 30:02.009
I want you to talk to him.

30:15.392 --> 30:17.558
Come shoot with me.

30:49.192 --> 30:51.893
You imagine that little bottle was me?

30:54.597 --> 30:57.265
I think, if it weren't
for you not knowing where

30:57.267 --> 31:00.501
to find Olivia, you'd think
about turning that weapon on me.

31:00.503 --> 31:02.470
In self-defense, of
course, not in cold blood

31:02.472 --> 31:06.541
'cause you're able to control...
Those impulses in yourself, right?

31:06.543 --> 31:09.977
You can, too. You're doing it now.

31:12.248 --> 31:16.484
I don't have many
memories of my real dad,

31:18.121 --> 31:20.588
actually, just one.

31:20.590 --> 31:22.757
I was 4 years old, and he was

31:22.759 --> 31:25.359
washing me up in the tub.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.395
I don't know what happened,
but all of a sudden,

31:27.397 --> 31:29.397
he's got his hands around my neck

31:29.399 --> 31:31.432
and he's holding me underwater

31:31.434 --> 31:33.367
and he's cursing me:

31:33.369 --> 31:35.870
"You should never have been born!

31:35.872 --> 31:37.939
You should never have been born!"

31:37.941 --> 31:39.907
And I'll bet those were the same words

31:39.909 --> 31:43.678
you heard yourself telling
Grace before you took her life.

31:46.282 --> 31:48.783
Yes, sir...

31:50.353 --> 31:52.353
Only she didn't have Roberta to come

31:52.355 --> 31:54.455
fly in and save her like I did.

31:54.457 --> 31:56.457
After all these years,
I've never been able

31:56.459 --> 31:58.493
to figure out why she did that.

31:58.495 --> 32:00.428
She didn't love me.

32:00.430 --> 32:04.932
All I know, Everett, is that if
you surrender right now, you live.

32:06.269 --> 32:08.436
In a cage.

32:11.140 --> 32:14.141
Just to be clear...

32:14.143 --> 32:16.944
Give me a reason.

32:16.946 --> 32:19.080
If anything happens to me,

32:19.082 --> 32:22.316
and I'm unable to return
to Olivia, she's gonna die.

32:22.318 --> 32:24.852
Poor kid's got type 1 diabetes, and I

32:24.854 --> 32:27.154
spiked a dose of her insulin.

32:27.156 --> 32:29.657
Not back around dinner...

32:29.659 --> 32:32.360
Well, it's not gonna be pretty.

32:36.399 --> 32:39.066
Just let me go.

32:49.012 --> 32:52.046
You know, this doesn't have to
end the way you think it does.

32:52.048 --> 32:54.115
How does it end, Agent Rossi?

32:54.117 --> 32:58.219
You let Olivia go, and you realize
you're not your father's son.

32:58.221 --> 33:00.421
I'm still my mama's boy.

33:13.536 --> 33:16.037
You made the right call, JJ.

33:16.039 --> 33:19.907
If... We can keep our eyes on him.

33:21.878 --> 33:23.377
They lost him. They lost Lynch.

33:23.379 --> 33:25.513
Reno PD and the park rangers.

33:25.515 --> 33:27.037
They blocked the access roads,

33:27.037 --> 33:29.518
but Lynch's Mercedes is still
up there on Jasper's Ridge.

33:29.519 --> 33:31.686
So he's got to be on foot
somewhere in that wilderness.

33:31.688 --> 33:33.688
Yeah, that's what I thought, too, but

33:33.690 --> 33:35.690
there's these abandoned mining tunnels

33:35.692 --> 33:37.625
that were dug out in the 1800s.

33:37.627 --> 33:39.560
Maybe he took advantage of that.

33:50.740 --> 33:53.741
Great. First my phone, and now this.

33:53.743 --> 33:56.644
You left it in the kitchen.

33:56.646 --> 33:58.145
Thanks.

33:58.147 --> 33:59.814
Sure.

34:03.886 --> 34:06.153
Um...

34:06.155 --> 34:08.422
Has my mom called you?

34:08.424 --> 34:10.891
No, not yet, you know,
and I really just think

34:10.893 --> 34:12.893
it's best if I drop you off
at your grandma's because...

34:12.895 --> 34:17.431
Because your mother is never
comin' home, little girl.

34:17.433 --> 34:20.167
Isn't that right, Everett?

34:20.168 --> 34:22.136
Who the hell are you?

34:22.138 --> 34:24.639
Olivia, this is my mom.

34:24.641 --> 34:29.510
You are gonna tell this child the truth.

34:34.321 --> 34:36.788
- Garcia find something?
- Yeah, I did.

34:36.790 --> 34:39.824
It looks like Roberta Lynch spent a
significant part of her teenage years

34:39.827 --> 34:42.360
bouncing from family
members to family friends,

34:42.362 --> 34:44.862
including the Duggans of Reno.

34:44.864 --> 34:46.831
Now, they made all their
money in the gaming industry,

34:46.833 --> 34:50.469
most of them moved away except
for one... Alexandria Duggan.

34:50.471 --> 34:52.637
JJ, Reid, Garcia, sending
you the address now.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.139
All right, we got it.

34:54.141 --> 34:56.608
Also, FBI SWAT officers are
on their way to meet you.

34:56.610 --> 34:59.444
You may not make it there in
time to save Lynch from Roberta.

34:59.446 --> 35:01.980
I'm only concerned with saving
Olivia Irwinâ€™s life right now.

35:01.982 --> 35:04.282
I know Roberta thinks
she can kill her son,

35:04.284 --> 35:06.384
but when it comes down to it,
she won't pull the trigger.

35:06.386 --> 35:09.521
I think she will. You didn't see
her react to that photo of Grace.

35:09.523 --> 35:11.723
No, but I did see her sentimental
side, and it's hard to see

35:11.725 --> 35:13.725
how she'd be able to
completely disassociate

35:13.727 --> 35:15.694
from her relationship to her only child.

35:15.696 --> 35:17.896
But if Lynch figures that
out, he'll have the advantage,

35:17.898 --> 35:20.265
and I'm sure he won't
hesitate to kill her.

35:23.403 --> 35:25.403
You want the truth, huh?

35:25.405 --> 35:27.405
You want the truth? This is it.

35:27.407 --> 35:28.907
No!

35:28.909 --> 35:31.109
No, Mom. No, no! You didn't!

35:31.111 --> 35:34.179
Oh, yeah, and you...
You need to see this.

35:35.048 --> 35:37.649
I didn't want to do this.

35:37.651 --> 35:39.651
Something came over me.

35:39.653 --> 35:41.920
I don't know what it is.

35:41.922 --> 35:45.624
Something inside. It's like a part
of me and it's a part of you, too!

35:45.626 --> 35:47.726
You're a monster.

35:47.728 --> 35:50.695
Hmm. Mmm.

35:50.697 --> 35:53.899
Ah, I bet you're wishing you let
Daddy drown me now, huh? Ha ha ha!

36:13.120 --> 36:16.354
Van to Montero. We need to
surround and secure the perimeter.

36:16.356 --> 36:18.290
Yes, ma'am.

36:21.295 --> 36:23.328
No, no, no, no!

36:23.330 --> 36:25.297
Shh, shh. Relax.

36:25.299 --> 36:28.366
- Relax, ok?
- â€­

36:28.368 --> 36:29.801
This is the FBI.

36:29.803 --> 36:33.104
No, no, no, no, no. No,
I'm gonna talk to them.

36:35.108 --> 36:36.841
- On the ground.
- OK.

36:49.289 --> 36:51.423
Is this Agent Rossi?

36:51.425 --> 36:53.391
No, Roberta, my name
is Dr. Spencer Reid,

36:53.393 --> 36:55.493
and it's important that
you listen to me right now.

36:55.495 --> 36:58.330
Even though you have the gun,
the moment your son realizes

36:58.332 --> 37:01.099
you're not gonna shoot him,
he's gonna get the upper hand.

37:01.101 --> 37:03.768
You're wrong...

37:05.205 --> 37:07.305
'Cause my son

37:07.307 --> 37:09.274
is going to pay

37:09.276 --> 37:11.242
for what he did to Grace.

37:11.244 --> 37:15.013
Yes, but first you need to let
Olivia walk out of there, ok?

37:15.015 --> 37:17.015
Yeah.

37:17.017 --> 37:18.483
Olivia.

37:18.485 --> 37:21.019
- Go. Hurry, go.
- Now, wait a second...

37:22.089 --> 37:23.888
Roberta?

37:25.792 --> 37:29.027
Don't you worry. She's
on her way out to you.

37:37.671 --> 37:40.705
Roberta, that warning shot is what's
about to give you away, but we can help.

37:40.707 --> 37:42.907
Are you ready for us to come
in? We can save you both.

37:42.909 --> 37:44.075
Ha!

37:45.012 --> 37:46.511
Dave, they found this bag

37:46.513 --> 37:48.179
discarded on the side of the road.

37:48.181 --> 37:50.715
Looks like it's Roberta's.

38:07.200 --> 38:10.669
You realize how this
has to end, right? Right?

38:11.972 --> 38:13.471
Roberta?

38:13.473 --> 38:15.006
Yes... I'm ready.

38:15.008 --> 38:16.541
I'm ready.

38:16.543 --> 38:18.443
Captain Montero, breach.

38:24.051 --> 38:25.517
Rossi?

38:25.519 --> 38:28.019
JJ, Roberta isn't there to kill Lynch.

38:28.021 --> 38:30.255
She's there to die with him.

38:32.225 --> 38:34.592
Spence! Stop!

39:00.387 --> 39:03.121
Spence, are you ok?

39:05.559 --> 39:07.826
No, no, no, no. Stay down, stay down.

39:23.610 --> 39:25.577
Deputy director Barbour.

39:25.579 --> 39:28.913
Yeah, I was wondering if you had
at least a preliminary assessment

39:28.915 --> 39:30.915
of the losses at the Lynch scene.

39:30.917 --> 39:34.719
6 FBI SWAT officers are confirmed dead.

39:34.721 --> 39:38.656
It appears, at some point, Lynch
was able to detach a gas line.

39:38.658 --> 39:42.026
The explosion itself seemed to
have been triggered by a gunshot.

39:42.028 --> 39:44.329
BAU never profiled suicidal ideations

39:44.331 --> 39:45.997
in either Everett or Roberta Lynch.

39:45.999 --> 39:47.665
I mean, how could you miss that?

39:47.667 --> 39:50.301
Based on the behavior,
we were able to evaluate

39:50.303 --> 39:53.872
there was never any indication
of that predisposition.

39:53.874 --> 39:56.107
Who gave the order to breach?

39:57.110 --> 39:59.611
Any action taken by a member of my team

39:59.613 --> 40:01.613
is executed under my order.

40:01.615 --> 40:04.015
The buck stops with me, always.

40:04.017 --> 40:06.985
Well, as you can imagine,

40:06.987 --> 40:09.988
the idea that we would
promote you after...

40:09.990 --> 40:11.990
Deputy director Barbour, am I still

40:11.992 --> 40:13.324
the unit chief of the BAU?

40:13.326 --> 40:14.826
Yes.

40:14.828 --> 40:18.062
Fine. Then if you'll excuse me...

40:54.734 --> 40:57.268
It doesn't make sense to me.

40:57.270 --> 40:59.204
Captain Montero, breach.

41:02.676 --> 41:04.876
I don't understand.

41:18.558 --> 41:21.092
It doesn't make sense to me.

41:22.362 --> 41:24.395
I don't understand how
that kind of personality

41:24.397 --> 41:26.764
can choose to blow itself up.

41:26.766 --> 41:30.735
If Roberta gave in to him...

41:30.737 --> 41:33.238
- Just breathe, Mom.
- â€­

41:33.240 --> 41:36.441
And if he took the gun away...

41:37.310 --> 41:39.244
Aah!

41:39.246 --> 41:41.913
If he could get to a tunnel...

41:54.027 --> 41:56.027
Lynch.

41:56.029 --> 41:58.696
He's still alive.
