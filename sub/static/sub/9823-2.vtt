43:41.752 --> 43:43.552
Which comes first?

43:43.587 --> 43:45.387
Uh, it's dealer's choice.

43:45.423 --> 43:47.489
That's where the crying comes in, right?

43:47.525 --> 43:49.325
That's a safe bet.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.726
[Laughs]

43:50.761 --> 43:52.895
How the hell ‭did you come up with that?

43:52.930 --> 43:54.863
If you gave me a million years,

43:54.899 --> 43:56.565
I still would not have come up with that.

43:56.600 --> 43:57.633
The muse.

43:57.668 --> 43:59.168
She speaks through me.

43:59.203 --> 44:01.303
I am but a humble vessel.

44:01.339 --> 44:02.571
And they bought it?

44:02.606 --> 44:04.340
- Yeah.
- Wow.

44:04.375 --> 44:05.974
I've heard some far-out
scenarios used to sow doubt,

44:06.010 --> 44:07.743
but this definitely takes the cake.

44:07.778 --> 44:09.912
Kim, Kim, Kim.

44:09.947 --> 44:11.080
- Takes the pie.
- Yeah.

44:11.115 --> 44:12.548
[Chuckling] Sorry.

44:12.583 --> 44:14.249
I should just jump off the roof right now.

44:14.285 --> 44:16.819
Yeah, you should feel bad about yourself.

44:16.854 --> 44:19.088
Jesus, can you tell a story.

44:19.123 --> 44:23.926
Well, to be fair, I think it was
the video that clinched it.

44:23.961 --> 44:26.195
What video?

44:26.230 --> 44:29.231
Wait, wait. You...
‭You actually made a video?

44:29.266 --> 44:32.101
I got to say, in the end,
ol' Dan really committed.

44:32.136 --> 44:34.570
I believed the tears.

44:34.605 --> 44:39.408
Um, this is a leftover prop. It was extra.

44:39.443 --> 44:42.945
I wasn't sure how many takes
we would need, so I over-bought,

44:42.980 --> 44:46.949
but I promise you,
‭untouched by human buttocks.

44:46.984 --> 44:49.685
You fabricated evidence?

44:49.720 --> 44:51.453
I made a video.

44:51.489 --> 44:53.122
Not exactly evidence.

44:53.157 --> 44:54.757
You used it to exonerate a client.

44:54.792 --> 44:58.861
You used falsified evidence
to exonerate a client.

44:58.896 --> 45:00.429
Mm, I think you're splitting hairs.

45:00.464 --> 45:02.064
I'm not splitting hairs.

45:02.099 --> 45:06.268
What if Davis & Main find out
you faked evidence?

45:06.303 --> 45:08.036
It wasn't a Davis & Main client.

45:08.072 --> 45:10.773
It was some nothing, little pro-bono thing.

45:10.808 --> 45:12.908
It was off the clock. It was,
uh, totally my own thing.

45:12.943 --> 45:13.976
Why?

45:16.847 --> 45:18.947
Why would you risk
‭the best job you've ever had

45:18.983 --> 45:20.916
for some pro-bono case?

45:20.951 --> 45:22.785
I was doing a favor for a friend.

45:22.820 --> 45:25.721
Risking disbarment?
That's... that's some friend.

45:25.756 --> 45:28.223
It's fine! It... it worked out.

45:28.259 --> 45:30.092
Davis & Main are none the wiser.

45:30.127 --> 45:31.960
Jimmy, ‭you're playing with fire here.

45:31.996 --> 45:34.596
I didn't see you complaining

45:34.632 --> 45:37.900
when, um, Ken the douchebag paid
our bar bill the other night.

45:37.935 --> 45:40.636
No, that was a little bit
of rule breaking right there.

45:40.671 --> 45:43.272
And if I remember correctly, you liked it.

45:43.307 --> 45:44.573
A lot.

45:44.608 --> 45:46.909
That is so not the same thing.

45:46.944 --> 45:48.343
How? What's the difference?

45:48.379 --> 45:49.912
That had nothing to do with work.

45:49.947 --> 45:52.915
And we were just... just screwing around.

45:52.950 --> 45:53.949
This?

45:53.984 --> 45:56.819
Fabricating evidence.

45:56.854 --> 45:58.754
Jimmy, ‭this could really hurt you.

45:58.789 --> 46:00.656
If they find out, if you get caught...

46:00.691 --> 46:02.758
It... they're never gonna find out.

46:02.793 --> 46:05.093
Seriously? You sound like
every dumb criminal out there.

46:05.129 --> 46:07.696
If you keep this up, they will find out.

46:09.667 --> 46:13.602
- For what, Jimmy?
- ‭[Sighs]

46:13.637 --> 46:15.838
What is the point?

46:20.644 --> 46:23.479
[Clears throat]

46:32.056 --> 46:35.824
I cannot hear ‭about this sort of thing.

46:35.860 --> 46:38.594
Ever again. Okay?

46:42.433 --> 46:45.100
I mean it, Jimmy.

46:47.271 --> 46:49.204
You won't.
