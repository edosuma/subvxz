00:02.160 --> 00:04.232
Previously on "Pretty Little Liars".

00:05.233 --> 00:07.167
You said you knew who
dug up Ali's grave?

00:07.202 --> 00:08.302
I didn't kill Alison.

00:08.336 --> 00:10.304
What was snatched from her grave
would have proved it.

00:10.338 --> 00:13.373
People lie.
Medical records don't.

00:13.408 --> 00:14.441
Are those teeth?

00:14.476 --> 00:16.210
It wasn't enough
to steal her bones,

00:16.244 --> 00:17.544
we're gonna get pieces
of her delivered to us?

00:17.579 --> 00:20.514
You have made my life
a nightmare! You owe me!

00:20.548 --> 00:22.583
I lost my accompanist
for next week's assembly,

00:22.617 --> 00:25.285
and I thought of asking you
to play with me.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.553
Did you study for this?

00:26.588 --> 00:29.223
I did the best I could.

00:29.257 --> 00:31.592
There's a lot riding
on this for her. Maybe if.

00:31.626 --> 00:34.394
She could take it again. There's
no need for her to take it again.

00:34.429 --> 00:37.164
Lucas. What is he doing
out so late? Shh!

00:37.198 --> 00:41.235
Real teeth or not, that was
definitely stolen from Ali's grave.

00:41.269 --> 00:44.204
I can't talk. My new attorney
made me promise.

00:44.239 --> 00:46.306
I remembered.
She was driving that night.

00:46.341 --> 00:47.608
Bitch can see!

00:58.353 --> 00:59.620
God, what a performance.

00:59.654 --> 01:02.222
Can you imagine
faking it for so long?

01:02.257 --> 01:04.424
What do you think
she's planning?

01:04.459 --> 01:06.193
That's what you
have to find out.

01:06.227 --> 01:08.228
She trusts you.

01:08.263 --> 01:11.131
Or at least she wants you
to think that she does.

01:11.166 --> 01:14.101
Great. That...
That's awesome.

01:14.135 --> 01:16.537
Hey, I'll trade you Mona for Jenna.
No, thanks.

01:16.571 --> 01:20.240
I think I felt safer when Mona wasn't talking.
There she goes.

01:22.610 --> 01:26.313
We should push a table in front
of her and see what happens.

01:26.347 --> 01:29.583
God, Hanna, you have all the
subtlety of a hand grenade.

01:29.617 --> 01:31.585
Thank you.

01:31.619 --> 01:35.589
Has your mom said anything to you
about taking Garrett's case?

01:35.623 --> 01:38.325
Not yet. But Melissa's
coming home tomorrow,

01:38.359 --> 01:40.561
so she'll probably tell
both of us at the same time.

01:40.595 --> 01:42.462
'Cause that's how
it works in my family...

01:42.497 --> 01:45.199
We keep the one-on-ones
to a minimum.

01:45.233 --> 01:47.234
You're not helping yourself,
Mr. gottesman.

01:47.268 --> 01:50.204
This all goes on
your permanent record!

02:08.323 --> 02:10.424
Lucas?

02:10.458 --> 02:13.327
Why is vice-principal hackett
so mad at you?

02:13.361 --> 02:15.462
I'm supposed to give this
to my parents.

02:15.496 --> 02:19.166
It looks like I've lost
my "positive attitude.

02:19.200 --> 02:23.237
Negatively impacting my social
interactions and grades."

02:23.271 --> 02:25.305
Impacting?

02:25.340 --> 02:27.307
"Impacting."
That's not even a word.

02:27.342 --> 02:30.177
Are you okay?
Yeah.

02:30.211 --> 02:32.512
Yeah...
I'm just fine.

02:34.549 --> 02:36.583
No... Lucas,
what are you doing?!

02:36.618 --> 02:38.452
Stop!

02:50.465 --> 02:52.432
What the hell is going on?!

02:52.467 --> 02:55.535
Caleb, look,
we've gotta get out of here.

03:00.642 --> 03:03.443
<i># Got a secret,</i>
<i>can you keep it #</i>

03:03.478 --> 03:06.246
<i># swear this one you'll save</i>

03:06.281 --> 03:08.448
<i># better lock it</i>
<i>in your pocket #</i>

03:08.483 --> 03:11.285
<i># takin' this one</i>
<i>to the grave #</i>

03:11.319 --> 03:16.223
<i># if you show you, then I know</i>
<i>you won't tell what I said #</i>

03:16.257 --> 03:21.161
<i># 'cause two can keep a secret</i>
<i>if one othem is dead #</i>

03:26.534 --> 03:29.303
Lucas used to
he'll bebe so sweet.

03:29.337 --> 03:33.240
Hanna, the last word a guy wants a
girl to describe him with <i>sweet.</i>

03:33.274 --> 03:36.310
Well, now he's
a sour patch kid.

03:36.344 --> 03:39.212
He's just... making up
for lost time.

03:39.247 --> 03:43.317
Going through all the bad boy
behavior he saved up for senior year.

03:43.351 --> 03:46.086
You think so?
You still talk to him?

03:46.120 --> 03:48.355
Not much since
I moved out of his house.

03:48.389 --> 03:52.059
<i>Wi</i> you talk to him?
For me?

03:52.093 --> 03:55.062
Please?
I guess.

03:55.096 --> 03:58.332
But I need you to do something for me.
Name it.

03:58.366 --> 04:02.336
I want to make sure
this other situation.

04:02.370 --> 04:05.205
Caleb, Mona's not
dangerous anymore.

04:05.239 --> 04:08.375
She's under lock and key.
Keep it that way.

04:08.409 --> 04:11.244
You don't owe her anything.

04:11.279 --> 04:12.379
Okay!

04:12.413 --> 04:17.017
"Okay" meaning you won't
go out there anymore?

04:17.051 --> 04:20.220
You're sweet.

04:25.159 --> 04:29.363
So what made you
about playing with me?

04:31.099 --> 04:33.200
Um, I guess I was just
intimidated by.

04:33.234 --> 04:35.369
The whole idea
an audience. N front of.

04:35.403 --> 04:39.039
Hmm. Stage fright.
Yeah.

04:39.073 --> 04:43.043
There's only one way
you face it. That:

04:43.077 --> 04:46.213
You look it in the eye.

04:46.247 --> 04:48.382
Uh, yeah.

04:48.416 --> 04:51.418
Come over after school.
We'll practice.

04:51.452 --> 04:53.186
Sounds good.

04:56.457 --> 04:59.526
"Look it in the eye"?
That's what she said.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.262
That opens a whole new
dimension of creepy.

05:02.296 --> 05:05.132
Toby found her eye drops,
and Garrett's in jail.

05:05.166 --> 05:07.167
Maybe she's getting careless
about hiding things.

05:07.201 --> 05:08.969
Yeah, like that other earring.

05:09.003 --> 05:10.971
If you find that, case closed.

05:11.005 --> 05:12.339
Jenna is working
with this "a."

05:12.373 --> 05:14.975
It's not just the earring
that we have to worry about.

05:15.009 --> 05:17.444
Whoever opened Ali's grave
we put inside that coffin. S.

05:17.478 --> 05:19.312
We're gonna sort it out, em.

05:19.347 --> 05:22.382
I can snoop at the same time.

05:22.417 --> 05:25.118
Maybe this is a trap.

05:25.153 --> 05:27.320
I'm also pretty good
at running.

05:27.355 --> 05:31.091
Do you remember when
she knocked over that beehive?

05:32.460 --> 05:37.297
It's your mom. She posted
the grades for that makeup test.

05:37.331 --> 05:39.132
Might as well
get that over with.

05:39.167 --> 05:41.301
Wait a minute.
Yknocked over that beehive.

05:41.335 --> 05:43.236
Yeah, but it's a better story
if she did it.

05:43.271 --> 05:45.205
No, this can't be right.

05:45.239 --> 05:48.074
I got a 94 on the test.
Whoa!

05:48.109 --> 05:50.143
I wish was pulling nineties.

05:50.178 --> 05:52.245
Em, don't go all Spencer
on your grades.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.347
Excuse me. No, I
<i>couldn</i> have gotten that.

05:54.382 --> 05:58.285
I didn't even finish the test.
So it was a mistake.

05:58.319 --> 06:02.022
But you don't think
it was a mistake.

06:02.056 --> 06:05.058
The last thing I need right now
is people thinking I cheated.

06:05.092 --> 06:08.195
Wait, em. You think that someone
went into the school computer.

06:08.229 --> 06:11.031
And boosted your grade?
Someone in particular?

06:11.065 --> 06:13.433
Wait. Are we getting a
little paranoid right now?

06:13.468 --> 06:16.369
You're not paranoid if someone's
really out to get you.

06:30.451 --> 06:32.185
Hey.

06:34.021 --> 06:36.156
Is there something
I can help you with?

06:36.190 --> 06:38.992
Dude, you tried to
set fire to my girlfriend.

06:39.026 --> 06:44.231
Yeah, sorry about that. I was being
ground down by a trivial bureaucracy.

06:44.265 --> 06:47.033
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

06:47.068 --> 06:50.270
but is there something
that you want to talk about?

06:50.304 --> 06:54.307
What I want is for you
to mind your own business.

06:54.342 --> 06:58.278
Something I'm usually pretty good at,
but there are other people involved.

06:58.312 --> 07:01.114
Hanna's worried about you.
Yeah, like you worry about <i>pet.</i>

07:01.148 --> 07:04.251
Tell her to save her energy.
She's got bigger problems.

07:04.285 --> 07:08.021
I know all about Mona
being "a." Hanna told me.

07:08.055 --> 07:10.056
It's the tip of the iceberg.

07:10.091 --> 07:12.092
Lots more under the surface.

07:12.126 --> 07:14.961
Ancient history.
More like current events.

07:14.996 --> 07:17.297
You know, ripped
from today's headlines?

07:17.331 --> 07:20.033
What headlines
are we talking about?

07:22.103 --> 07:26.039
Icebergs turn over.
Did you know that?

07:26.073 --> 07:30.977
They just... roll over and bring
up all of that buried junk.

07:31.012 --> 07:34.281
You don't want to get too close
when that happens.

07:36.484 --> 07:38.985
Is that a threat?

07:39.020 --> 07:41.488
It's an observation.

07:52.266 --> 07:55.068
Mrs. Montgomery?
Can I talk to you?

07:55.102 --> 07:56.169
Of course.

07:56.203 --> 07:58.471
I wanted to ask you
about the makeup test.

07:58.506 --> 08:02.008
I saw my grade, and I think
there's something wrong.

08:02.043 --> 08:04.044
I don't think it's...

08:04.078 --> 08:06.179
Well, are you sure
it's accurate?

08:06.213 --> 08:07.280
Very sure.

08:07.315 --> 08:08.949
I got a 94.

08:08.983 --> 08:10.150
I know.

08:10.184 --> 08:13.286
How could I get a 94
on a test I didn't complete?

08:13.321 --> 08:16.356
I think somebody did something to the
test paper before you graded it,

08:16.390 --> 08:19.092
and I just want you to know
I had nothing to do with it.

08:19.126 --> 08:22.429
Emily, it's all right.
The test was completed.

08:22.463 --> 08:25.265
Yeah. I don't think
you understand.

08:25.299 --> 08:28.301
If it was completed,
it wasn't completed by me.

08:30.304 --> 08:34.039
I do understand, and now
I want to you to understand.

08:34.075 --> 08:36.176
The grade is accurate.

08:37.410 --> 08:41.280
Everything's all right,
I promise.

08:41.315 --> 08:43.316
Just keep working.

09:03.204 --> 09:05.939
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.

09:05.973 --> 09:09.142
Not a problem. Mom's not here yet.
Dad called.

09:09.176 --> 09:12.345
How was Washington?
Muggy.

09:16.217 --> 09:18.284
You okay?

09:18.319 --> 09:21.054
Tired.

09:22.423 --> 09:24.224
But you had a good time?

09:24.258 --> 09:27.227
Relatively.

09:32.433 --> 09:34.401
Mom.
Hi, honey.

09:34.435 --> 09:36.102
Spencer, I need to talk to you.

09:36.137 --> 09:38.138
Both of you.

09:38.172 --> 09:41.007
This is gonna become
public knowledge soon,

09:41.042 --> 09:44.444
but I wanted you to hear it
from me first.

09:44.478 --> 09:50.283
We've discussed this at the firm, and
I've decided to defend Garrett Reynolds.

09:53.421 --> 09:55.422
Why?

09:55.456 --> 09:57.323
I spoke to his mother.

09:57.358 --> 10:00.393
I know what it's like to have a child
accused of something they didn't do.

10:00.428 --> 10:04.197
The police have evidence.

10:04.231 --> 10:06.399
Maybe they do. I'd like
to see what it is.

10:06.434 --> 10:08.468
So you're doing this
out of curiosity?

10:08.502 --> 10:11.304
I'm doing this because everyone
deserves a strong defense.

10:11.338 --> 10:14.340
Mom, he has a lawyer.
I know his public defender.

10:14.375 --> 10:17.110
Hector is competent to handle
you for disturbing the peace,

10:17.144 --> 10:19.112
but he's out of his league
with this.

10:19.146 --> 10:20.480
He couldn't even get
a change of venue.

10:20.514 --> 10:23.349
Okay, then have
somebody else do it.

10:23.384 --> 10:25.452
There must be
a hundred other lawyers who can.

10:25.486 --> 10:28.488
I'm sure there are. I don't know any
that would take the case pro Bono.

10:28.522 --> 10:31.224
You're doing this for <i>free?</i>

10:31.258 --> 10:33.226
That's very generous of you.

10:33.260 --> 10:37.464
Okay, so you talked to his parents.
Have you spoken with Garrett?

10:37.498 --> 10:41.201
Yes. I found his story
to be credible.

10:41.235 --> 10:43.436
What story is that?!
All I can say is that.

10:43.471 --> 10:47.073
He convinced me of his lack of
guilt as pertains to the charges.

10:47.108 --> 10:50.143
Mom...
What are you doing?

10:50.177 --> 10:52.512
Okay? This is the man
who killed my best friend.

10:52.546 --> 10:57.350
He killed the girl that Emily was in love with.
<i>Accused</i> of killing them.

10:58.419 --> 11:00.153
Will you say something?

11:00.187 --> 11:01.354
What do you want me to say?

11:01.388 --> 11:03.389
This does involve <i>you.</i>

11:03.424 --> 11:08.061
Any interest I had in any of
this ended three months ago.

11:26.156 --> 11:27.956
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
that's what she was telling me.

11:26.991 --> 11:30.124
Why would she do that?
I don't know.

11:30.158 --> 11:33.125
She feels sorry for me?
Everybody feels sorry for me?

11:33.159 --> 11:35.993
It's not just you.
My mom's protective instincts.

11:36.027 --> 11:38.660
Have been in overdrive
since the divorce.

11:38.694 --> 11:40.728
She's...
She's compensating.

11:40.762 --> 11:42.829
Well, I just wish she'd
compensate on somebody else.

11:42.863 --> 11:45.230
At least it's not "a"
messing with your grades, right?

11:44.264 --> 11:48.531
No, but it's a secret, and "a" attracts
secrets like a mean girl magnet.

11:48.566 --> 11:51.165
And that mean girl is locked up at radley.
This is somebody else.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.166
Somebody who digs up graves.

11:56.267 --> 11:58.368
I can't believe that
we are talking about "a."

11:57.402 --> 12:01.202
I thought we were done with this
when they grabbed Mona.

12:01.236 --> 12:03.635
We're right back
in the same place.

12:01.670 --> 12:05.036
No, we're not.

12:05.070 --> 12:07.503
You're right.

12:10.537 --> 12:11.371
It's different.

12:11.405 --> 12:13.406
Listen, we did not
go through all of that.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.408
To crawl under
somebody else's thumb.

12:15.442 --> 12:18.244
I am way more angry
than I am scared now.

12:18.278 --> 12:22.081
Can I borrow some of that?

12:22.116 --> 12:24.417
Any time.

12:32.159 --> 12:35.128
When you
tell mom, be accurate.

12:35.162 --> 12:38.431
This is my second,
not including lunch.

12:38.465 --> 12:41.300
That's none of my business.

12:41.335 --> 12:44.003
That is correct.

12:44.038 --> 12:47.006
I do want to
ask you something, though.

12:49.109 --> 12:52.311
How do you really feel
about mom defending Garrett?

12:52.346 --> 12:56.416
How I feel?
I'm completely indifferent.

12:56.450 --> 12:59.118
Yeah, I don't really buy that.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.287
I think that somehow
you convinced her to do it.

13:01.321 --> 13:04.023
Why would I do that?
I don't know.

13:04.058 --> 13:07.193
But I know that you and he got awfully
tight just before he was arrested.

13:07.227 --> 13:11.097
You have a lurid imagination.

13:11.131 --> 13:15.001
My imagination is nothing
compared to the facts, Melissa.

13:15.035 --> 13:17.103
You were on that video
in Ali's bedroom,

13:17.137 --> 13:20.039
and when he walked out of that
bedroom, he killed someone.

13:20.074 --> 13:21.941
Will you just stop?

13:21.975 --> 13:25.211
For once in your life stop trying to
be the smartest person in the room.

13:25.245 --> 13:28.047
Climb out of spencerworld
long enough to see.

13:28.082 --> 13:31.350
Some people have lost
everythin <i>everything.</i>

13:33.353 --> 13:36.189
Melissa...

13:36.223 --> 13:39.358
When you called back in
June from the hospital,

13:39.393 --> 13:41.160
when you...

13:41.195 --> 13:43.229
When you were there,

13:43.263 --> 13:48.101
I asked mom if I could
come up and see you.<i>Did.</i>

13:48.135 --> 13:50.236
And she said no.

13:50.270 --> 13:54.240
I didn't want to
see anybody else.

13:54.274 --> 13:59.045
I woke up in that room
a hundred Miles from here...

13:59.079 --> 14:01.347
And I knew something was wrong.

14:01.381 --> 14:04.117
I just wanted mom.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.988
I'm sorry you lost your baby.

14:10.424 --> 14:13.259
You know, I hope
she does get him off...

14:13.293 --> 14:16.129
Guilty or not.
Why?

14:16.163 --> 14:18.197
Because of all the men
I've had to deal with,

14:18.232 --> 14:22.401
he is the <i>only</i> one who's
always told me the truth.

14:22.436 --> 14:26.973
I figured it out too late,
but I figured it out.

15:04.244 --> 15:07.180
Am I putting you to sleep?
No!

15:07.214 --> 15:10.049
No, no, no. I... I'm just a
little rusty on this part.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.217
We can take a break.

15:11.251 --> 15:13.219
Okay.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.195
So, how's Emily?

15:22.229 --> 15:24.363
When I hear her,
she <i>sounds</i> strong,

15:24.398 --> 15:28.067
but, um, it's hard to tell
when you can't see her face.

15:28.101 --> 15:31.237
She's fine.
Like you said, she's strong.

15:31.271 --> 15:35.041
But the heart can only take so
much... the heart and the mind.

15:35.075 --> 15:38.978
Poor little Mona.

15:39.012 --> 15:43.216
It's a little hard to think of her as "poor
little Mona" under the circumstances.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.951
Yeah, I suppose.

15:44.985 --> 15:48.054
The circumstances worked out
well for you, didn't they?

15:48.088 --> 15:52.325
It's not that tidy. Somebody
did open Alison's grave.

15:52.359 --> 15:56.195
But no one thinks that you
had anything to do with that.

15:56.230 --> 15:58.130
Do they?

16:01.301 --> 16:04.370
I bet those cookies
are cool enough now.

16:08.108 --> 16:09.242
You need any help?

16:09.276 --> 16:11.911
No, I can manage.

16:32.299 --> 16:34.900
Earplugs?
That's what it said.

16:34.935 --> 16:37.303
Okay, tomorrow's Wednesday.
If it means this week.

16:37.337 --> 16:39.939
I wish people would be
more specific with their clues.

16:39.973 --> 16:42.308
I'll put it in the suggestion box.
What do we do about this?

16:42.342 --> 16:45.244
I want to know where Jenna is
tomorrow at 4:15.

16:45.279 --> 16:48.147
She asked about you, em.
What did she want to know?

16:48.181 --> 16:51.217
How you were holding up.

16:51.251 --> 16:53.986
She wants to know if you can
remember being in the car with her.

16:54.021 --> 16:55.988
She just can't come out and say it.
This is crazy.

16:56.023 --> 16:59.125
It's like trying to read a book and
someone keeps ripping out the pages.

16:59.159 --> 17:01.327
Em, we'll put it together,
all right?

17:01.361 --> 17:04.163
Yeah. We know that somewhere
between being with us.

17:04.196 --> 17:07.066
And getting to Alison's grave,
you were with Jenna.

17:07.099 --> 17:09.935
We just have to find out how you
got in the car and where you went,

17:09.970 --> 17:12.305
and we'll be that much closer to
figuring out what happened that night.

17:14.273 --> 17:16.142
Mom. Hey.

17:16.175 --> 17:18.210
Have you spoken to <i>your</i> mom?

17:18.244 --> 17:21.047
Yeah. She gave
a prepared statement.

17:21.080 --> 17:22.915
And then she declined
to answer any questions.

17:22.949 --> 17:25.885
Why is she doing this?
Melissa made her do it.

17:25.919 --> 17:29.021
<i>Know.</i> I just...
I don't know why.

17:29.056 --> 17:31.257
Is she afraid of something
Garrett could say?

17:34.928 --> 17:37.029
I had a thought about
Garrett and Melissa.

17:37.064 --> 17:39.899
What kind of thought?

17:39.933 --> 17:41.967
A pretty nasty one.

17:42.002 --> 17:44.370
Okay, now you <i>have</i> to say it.

17:46.973 --> 17:49.975
What if Garrett and Melissa
got together?

17:50.010 --> 17:53.346
I mean, he went to the hospital
with her to get her ultrasound.

17:53.380 --> 17:55.214
Where are you going with this?

17:55.248 --> 17:58.918
I'm saying, what if Ian's not
the father of Melissa's baby?

17:58.952 --> 18:00.353
Okay, next stop <i>twilight zone.</i>

18:00.387 --> 18:03.856
Wait. If Garrett
got Melissa pregnant,

18:03.890 --> 18:05.958
why wouldn't she mar <i>him?</i>

18:05.992 --> 18:07.193
Well...

18:07.227 --> 18:10.029
My parents might not
have liked Ian,

18:10.063 --> 18:12.865
but he still had it
over a civil servant.

18:12.899 --> 18:15.234
Garrett was talking
about medical records...

18:15.268 --> 18:17.903
We <i>though</i> he was
talking about Jenna's.

18:17.938 --> 18:21.307
Jenna's medical records wouldn't
have changed your mother's mind,

18:21.341 --> 18:24.176
but... Melissa's...

18:26.113 --> 18:29.115
So, my mom can't drive me
to Philadelphia tomorrow.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.916
He has to speak with
the vice-principal.

18:30.951 --> 18:34.987
About what? I-I don't know.
She didn't say.

19:15.195 --> 19:18.130
There was a time
when a man would have wait weeks.

19:18.165 --> 19:20.099
For a rejection
to come by mail.

19:20.133 --> 19:24.804
Now the Internet delivers big,
concentrated blobs of disappointment.

19:24.838 --> 19:27.006
With the click of a mouse.

19:29.876 --> 19:32.878
So... there's no point
in me coming over there.

19:32.913 --> 19:35.080
And trying to
make you feel better?

19:35.115 --> 19:37.149
No, but...

19:37.184 --> 19:39.318
It's important to
keep up appearances.

19:52.199 --> 19:53.332
What?

19:56.236 --> 19:58.971
Have you ever
helped out a student?

20:00.340 --> 20:02.041
Is that a trick question?

20:02.075 --> 20:04.310
Well, like, they underperformed
on a test or something,

20:04.344 --> 20:06.212
but you knew that
they knew the information,

20:06.246 --> 20:09.181
so you helped out their grade
a little bit.

20:09.216 --> 20:13.319
I get the feeling this isn't
a hypothetical discussion.

20:15.355 --> 20:18.190
Emily thinks that
my mom helped her...

20:18.225 --> 20:19.959
Changed her grade on a test.

20:19.993 --> 20:23.863
Did Emily talk to your
mother about this? Yes.

20:23.897 --> 20:26.866
And my mom basically said
that that's what she did.

20:26.900 --> 20:28.234
Well, what <i>you</i> think?

20:28.268 --> 20:31.937
I...I think that
my mom's been through a lot.

20:31.972 --> 20:35.007
My stuff
and you-and-me stuff,

20:35.041 --> 20:37.910
and all that on top
of a divorce?

20:37.944 --> 20:40.379
I can see why she'd
want to help out Emily.

20:43.216 --> 20:45.217
You don't look surprised.

20:45.252 --> 20:50.256
Surprised that your mother would
want to help a student? No.

20:52.092 --> 20:56.128
The vice-principal wants to
talk to my mom about this.

20:56.162 --> 20:58.964
Are they gonna fire her?

21:02.969 --> 21:04.803
I drink a lot of water.

21:04.838 --> 21:07.106
My mouth is always really dry.
It's the pills.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.174
Really dry. So I drink
a lot of water.

21:09.209 --> 21:12.811
Sort of like a cleanse.
Do you want some water?

21:12.846 --> 21:15.514
Um, no. No, I'm fine,
thank you.

21:15.549 --> 21:17.249
Me too.

21:20.453 --> 21:23.489
You seem really different
from the last time I was here.

21:23.523 --> 21:25.357
They changed what I was taking.

21:25.392 --> 21:27.192
What I'm taking now
is different.

21:27.227 --> 21:29.261
But it makes my mouth
really dry.

21:29.296 --> 21:31.096
And they won't
let you have gum.

21:31.131 --> 21:33.232
What is the deal with that?

21:33.266 --> 21:35.467
So, do you have many visitors?
My parents.

21:35.502 --> 21:39.405
Mostly they just sit and look at me
like they don't quite know who I am.

21:39.439 --> 21:41.540
Awkward.

21:44.578 --> 21:49.248
But even when I was quiet,
I knew you were here.

21:49.282 --> 21:52.351
It helped. Really.

21:52.385 --> 21:55.354
I mean, let's be honest,

21:55.388 --> 21:57.523
we've had our ups and downs,

21:57.557 --> 22:01.327
and I've had to forgive myself
for a lot of that.

22:02.529 --> 22:05.164
But how are <i>you, Hanna banana?</i>

22:05.198 --> 22:07.066
What's the news
of the boulevard?

22:07.100 --> 22:09.101
I'm not here to talk
about the boulevard.

22:09.135 --> 22:11.337
Or the water, or the gum,
all right?

22:11.371 --> 22:15.174
We thought you being in here was
the end of it, and it's not.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.142
And you know that.

22:18.311 --> 22:21.447
The question is,
how <i>do</i> you know?

22:21.481 --> 22:23.349
Oh...

22:23.383 --> 22:26.385
I'm sorry somebody's
giving you such a hard time.

22:26.419 --> 22:29.054
You have to be
so careful these days.

22:29.089 --> 22:31.290
It's like you can't
trust <i>anybody.</i>

22:31.324 --> 22:33.392
Not even family.

22:33.426 --> 22:37.129
But don't worry.
You'll always have me.

22:37.163 --> 22:41.300
I'm not gonna forget
any of you.

22:41.334 --> 22:45.304
So, tell me, did they ever
find what's left of Alison?

23:32.097 --> 23:33.163
Hello.

23:36.334 --> 23:38.202
Hello.

23:38.236 --> 23:40.871
So you've discovered
my other office.

23:40.906 --> 23:43.974
This is where I see some of the
students that I've started tutoring.

23:44.009 --> 23:47.144
Are we going to have
a turf war?

23:47.178 --> 23:49.346
No, no,
I don't think so.

23:49.381 --> 23:52.049
I want to talk to you
about Emily.

23:56.087 --> 23:59.890
Emily talks to Aria,
and Aria talks to you.

23:59.925 --> 24:01.058
That's our brave new world.

24:01.092 --> 24:03.928
Why does hackett
want to talk to you?

24:03.962 --> 24:06.964
It's nothing for you
to be concerned about.

24:06.998 --> 24:09.900
I'm not just a spectator here.

24:11.269 --> 24:14.071
He wants to ask me
about my grading practice.

24:14.105 --> 24:16.307
Okay. Why?

24:18.009 --> 24:20.844
The office received a note
from a student.

24:20.879 --> 24:23.280
Who thinks I might be
showing favoritism...

24:23.315 --> 24:25.149
Altering test scores.

24:25.183 --> 24:28.953
Which student?
It was anonymous.

24:28.987 --> 24:32.222
I've done
a very foolish.

24:32.257 --> 24:34.892
And shortsighted thing.

24:34.926 --> 24:37.294
You did a very human thing.

24:37.329 --> 24:39.897
How are you gonna handle it?

24:39.931 --> 24:44.301
I'm going to handle it the way that
Emily handled it when she found out...

24:44.336 --> 24:47.237
I'm going to tell the truth.

24:47.272 --> 24:51.241
Or... I could blame you.

24:51.276 --> 24:54.945
Maybe if you'd come into the
classroom a little bit earlier,

24:54.980 --> 24:56.246
I wouldn't have done it.

24:56.281 --> 24:59.083
That's an interesting approach,

24:59.117 --> 25:02.019
but if it works for you,
go for it.

25:02.053 --> 25:04.922
You know, with everything else
going on in my life,

25:04.956 --> 25:09.259
I thought I was okay at work...
That I had perspective.

25:10.929 --> 25:12.930
I was wrong.

25:12.964 --> 25:16.133
It's not easy
to keep things separate.

25:16.167 --> 25:19.103
No, it's not.

25:28.947 --> 25:31.749
Are you following me?
No.

25:31.783 --> 25:36.020
That would mean I didn't know where you
were going, and I was pretty sure of that.

25:36.054 --> 25:38.822
Do you want
a ride back to town?

25:38.857 --> 25:41.191
I thought that we had a deal
about you not coming out here.

25:41.226 --> 25:43.193
Why can't you just
trust me on this?

25:43.228 --> 25:45.229
I <i>do</i> trust you, okay?
I just don't want you.

25:45.263 --> 25:48.932
Coming out here to visit madhouse Mona.
Do not call her that.

25:48.967 --> 25:50.034
I call 'em like I see 'em.

25:50.068 --> 25:51.969
There is another Mona
in there...

25:52.003 --> 25:55.072
The one I grew up with,
the one who stuck with me,

25:55.106 --> 25:57.941
not the one who tore up your
letter or tortured my friends.

25:57.976 --> 26:00.244
And ran me over with a car.

26:00.278 --> 26:02.880
Whoa, whoa, spool back.

26:02.914 --> 26:05.049
<i>When</i> did she hit you
with a car?

26:10.021 --> 26:12.156
She is the one
that ran you over?

26:12.190 --> 26:15.159
No. You know what, I went
over the car, not under it.

26:15.193 --> 26:17.961
Why didn't you say something?
What was I supposed to tell you?

26:17.996 --> 26:20.898
The truth? You make it
sound like it's so easy.

26:20.932 --> 26:23.167
You want to know the truth,
well, boom! Here it is.

26:23.201 --> 26:26.003
It's like a big bowl of
spaghetti that's all tangled.

26:26.037 --> 26:29.106
Have you ever untangled spaghetti?
No.

26:29.140 --> 26:31.108
Well, there you go.

26:40.785 --> 26:42.920
Hey, you know what, I need to talk to you.
About what?

26:42.954 --> 26:46.056
You were visiting Mona.
Maybe.

26:46.091 --> 26:49.093
I could have a lot of
emotionally disturbed friends.

26:49.127 --> 26:51.261
I saw you go in the day room.

26:53.264 --> 26:56.934
Okay, fine. I was
visiting Mona. So what?

26:56.968 --> 26:59.069
Why? Same reason you've
been visiting her...

26:59.104 --> 27:02.206
To see if she's really mental.
That's not why I'm here.

27:02.240 --> 27:06.009
No? You didn't even consider
that she might be faking?

27:06.044 --> 27:08.045
That was pretty stupid, Hanna.

27:08.079 --> 27:11.181
Why would she be faking it?
Better than going to jail.

27:11.216 --> 27:13.951
And safer.
Safer for who?

27:13.985 --> 27:17.821
It's better for a lot of people
if Mona stays crazy. Right?

27:42.597 --> 27:44.030
What time is it?

27:45.064 --> 27:45.864
Uh, four o'clock.

27:46.898 --> 27:49.765
Do you think h. Cobb
is coming to her,

27:49.799 --> 27:51.300
or is she going to
him, her, whatever.

27:52.234 --> 27:55.203
I couldn't tell from the note. It just
said "Cobb, 415," and "earplugs."

27:56.237 --> 27:59.106
Earplugs?

27:59.140 --> 28:04.111
I do <i>not</i> need things
to get any weirder.

28:04.145 --> 28:07.247
Hi. My name is Melissa Hastings,

28:07.281 --> 28:10.317
and I was an emergency room
patient there back in June.

28:10.351 --> 28:13.153
I was just wondering if I could
get a copy of my records.

28:13.187 --> 28:15.021
For the insurance company.

28:15.056 --> 28:18.291
Ma <i>i'll connect you to patient services.
Thank you.</i>

28:18.326 --> 28:20.927
Ezra knows what your mom did?

28:20.962 --> 28:22.295
We danced around it a bit,

28:22.330 --> 28:24.264
but he finally
came out and said it.

28:24.298 --> 28:27.000
I wish I had a teacher like that.
Hanna.

28:27.034 --> 28:29.403
This is a <i>bad</i> thing.
My mom needs this job.

28:29.437 --> 28:33.140
Sorry! She was just trying
to help out poor em.

28:33.174 --> 28:37.210
Yeah, I think poor em is getting a
little tired of being called "poor em."

28:41.082 --> 28:44.050
Are you sure?
It would have been June tenth.

28:44.085 --> 28:47.120
I was staying at the Hanover, and
then I came in through the E.R.

28:47.155 --> 28:49.122
It was a miscarriage.

28:49.157 --> 28:50.424
I'm sorry, miss Hastings,

28:50.458 --> 28:54.127
we have no record
of you being in this facility.

28:54.162 --> 28:56.196
Well, I was.

28:56.230 --> 29:00.066
I-I might have given you
my husband's name, Thomas.

29:00.101 --> 29:03.103
Could you look that up? It's the
same social security number.

29:03.137 --> 29:06.106
<i>Just a moment.</i>

29:06.140 --> 29:08.308
I should have just
come out and asked him.

29:08.342 --> 29:11.912
"Lucas, you were at the masquerade with Jenna.
Who were you talking to?

29:11.946 --> 29:14.948
Who was the black swan?" You would
have asked him that in front of Caleb?

29:14.982 --> 29:17.284
I couldn't make things worse
with Caleb if I tried.

29:17.318 --> 29:20.287
Well, has he asked you
anything else about Mona?

29:20.321 --> 29:22.155
About the hit-and-run
or anything?

29:22.190 --> 29:25.091
No. He didn't say a word
the whole drive back to town.

29:25.126 --> 29:28.295
Honestly, I think he's scared
to ask me anything.

29:31.032 --> 29:33.099
<i>No Hastings, no Thomas...</i>

29:33.134 --> 29:36.269
<i>I'm sorry, there's no record</i>
<i>of you being here.</i>

29:36.304 --> 29:41.007
Well, I... suppose I might have
gone to another hospital.

29:41.042 --> 29:44.211
If you were staying at the Hanover,
this is where they would have sent you.

29:44.245 --> 29:48.281
The next closest emergency room
is three towns over.

29:50.218 --> 29:52.152
Thank you.

30:15.309 --> 30:18.011
I guess we're going for a ride.

30:26.153 --> 30:28.221
<i>Hanover resort.</i>
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

30:28.256 --> 30:30.323
Hi. My name is
Melissa Hastings,

30:30.358 --> 30:33.093
and I was a guest
at your resort this summer.

30:33.127 --> 30:34.461
I have a question
about my bill.

30:34.495 --> 30:37.330
<i>I can help you with that.</i>
<i>Let me pull it up.</i>

30:37.365 --> 30:41.001
So my credit card statement
shows me leaving on June tenth.

30:41.035 --> 30:43.136
Does that match your records?
<i>Miss Hastings,</i>

30:43.170 --> 30:45.438
I show you staying
three days beyond the tenth.

30:45.473 --> 30:49.242
Are you sure? <i>I have
restaurant and spa charges.</i>

30:49.277 --> 30:51.244
<i>As well as the additional room.</i>

30:51.279 --> 30:55.282
Additional room? <i>For Veronica
Hastings, arriving June tenth.</i>

30:55.316 --> 30:57.317
<i>You used the same credit card</i>
<i>for both rooms.</i>

30:57.351 --> 31:00.120
<i>And check out together</i>
<i>on the thirteenth.</i>

31:01.389 --> 31:03.390
The thirteenth.

31:13.067 --> 31:15.068
Emily...

31:15.102 --> 31:16.269
What are you doing here?

31:16.304 --> 31:19.105
I'm gonna talk to
the vice-principal with you.

31:19.140 --> 31:22.409
No. No, you're not. This was
my misjudgment, not yours.

31:22.443 --> 31:26.012
Tell me you would have
done this for anybody else.

31:26.047 --> 31:27.414
That's not the point.

31:27.448 --> 31:30.183
Mrs. Montgomery, I'm really
grateful that you did this,

31:30.217 --> 31:32.085
but you don't know
what you've done.

31:32.119 --> 31:35.322
Mrs. Montgomery, look who
came back for a visit.

31:35.356 --> 31:37.123
Mrs. Montgomery.
Emily.

31:37.158 --> 31:39.292
Mr. Fitz.
Ezra.

31:39.327 --> 31:42.162
Uh, Mr. hackett,
you wanted to see me.

31:42.196 --> 31:44.164
I did, but the matter
has been resolved.

31:44.198 --> 31:48.368
It has? I told Mr. hackett
about my going to your class.

31:48.402 --> 31:50.170
After Emily's makeup test.

31:50.204 --> 31:53.340
I guess I just got a little
overinvested in being your tutor.

31:53.374 --> 31:55.275
Happens to the best of us.

31:55.309 --> 31:59.412
I also confessed to getting you
to grade her test in front of me.

31:59.447 --> 32:02.415
To see how she did, and I
realized that might look like

32:02.450 --> 32:05.185
I was trying to get her
preferential treatment.

32:05.219 --> 32:07.387
Nonsense. Just a
little professional courtesy.

32:07.421 --> 32:10.323
To help the system work better.

32:10.358 --> 32:15.161
Well, anyway, I feel better
getting it off my conscience.

32:23.037 --> 32:25.005
A medical building?

32:25.039 --> 32:27.240
All this for a crummy
doctor's appointment?

32:27.308 --> 32:29.075
Seriously?
What a rip.

32:29.110 --> 32:31.411
Let's just go over there,
look at the directory,

32:31.445 --> 32:34.314
and see what kind of doctor
Dr. Cobb is.

32:34.348 --> 32:37.317
Give her a minute to get out
of the lobby, then we'll go.

32:43.457 --> 32:45.058
Look.

32:47.395 --> 32:49.462
Oh, my God, it's Jenna!

32:49.497 --> 32:52.365
Call Spencer and em!

32:58.039 --> 33:01.274
Spence, call Emily,
tell her we're following Jenna.

33:11.183 --> 33:13.285
You know, you'd think
I would have remembered.

33:13.319 --> 33:15.220
This thing owes me
a lot of quarters.

33:21.560 --> 33:25.497
When did you become friends
with Arthur hackett?

33:25.531 --> 33:29.167
I'm not, but I know how much
he hates conflict.

33:29.201 --> 33:31.336
Almost as much as
he hates making a decision,

33:31.370 --> 33:34.406
so I thought if I offered him
a way out, he'd take it.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.374
And he did.
Mm-mm.

33:36.409 --> 33:38.176
Yeah.

33:38.210 --> 33:41.112
So now we've both
lied for Emily.

33:41.147 --> 33:43.315
Yeah.
Some role models we are.

33:43.349 --> 33:45.383
And why did you do this?

33:45.418 --> 33:48.086
This has nothing to do
with Aria and me,

33:48.120 --> 33:50.322
if that's what you're thinking.
Then why?

33:50.356 --> 33:53.425
Because I knew why
you did what you did.

33:53.459 --> 33:56.127
I'm a teacher.

33:56.162 --> 33:58.496
And we used to be friends.

34:03.369 --> 34:05.403
Thank you for the soda.

34:16.081 --> 34:18.516
She went in there.

34:18.551 --> 34:23.487
A <i>gun</i> store? What is she doing
at a... frickin' gun store?!

34:23.522 --> 34:26.091
Duh. Can you say
"target practice"?

34:26.125 --> 34:27.425
That's the car, isn't it?

34:27.460 --> 34:30.495
That's the one.

34:30.529 --> 34:33.098
Spence, did you
call the hospital?

34:33.132 --> 34:35.333
Yeah, I called.

34:35.368 --> 34:39.170
Are they... are they
sending the records?

34:39.205 --> 34:43.174
There aren't any records.
What's that supposed to mean?

34:43.208 --> 34:45.577
It means that Melissa
didn't lose her baby in June.

34:49.482 --> 34:51.449
There she is.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.121
Okay.

34:56.155 --> 34:57.188
Hanna, stop. Stop.

34:57.223 --> 34:59.357
No, Spencer, I'm sick of this.

34:59.392 --> 35:03.094
We're lying to everybody,
everybody's lying to us... no mas.

35:03.129 --> 35:05.430
Han... you...
Let her go.

35:14.273 --> 35:17.709
Wow, Jenna.
What a sight for sore eyes.

35:25.384 --> 35:27.685
My Uncle ned
taught me solitaire.

35:27.720 --> 35:32.290
He said as long as I had a deck
of cards, I'd never be bored.

35:32.324 --> 35:36.327
He taught me eight sages, twelve
sleeping maidens, blonds and brunettes.

35:36.362 --> 35:39.631
But I like klondike the best.

35:39.665 --> 35:43.435
I like the way it looks.
Don't you?

35:43.469 --> 35:45.303
Yeah.

35:46.605 --> 35:50.275
You're big on games.
It helps pass the time.

35:50.309 --> 35:52.410
Till what?

35:56.282 --> 36:00.318
Maybe I believe this,
and maybe I don't...

36:00.352 --> 36:02.420
But get this straight...

36:02.455 --> 36:05.523
Do not mess with Hanna.

36:05.558 --> 36:07.592
That is the one thing
that I came here to say,

36:07.626 --> 36:09.394
and I've said it.

36:09.428 --> 36:12.330
You two make a lovely couple.

36:12.364 --> 36:16.334
You're laughing at all of
us in there, in your head.

36:16.368 --> 36:18.303
Aren't you?

36:22.208 --> 36:24.476
Well, here's the real joke.

36:24.510 --> 36:26.611
I get to walk out of that door.

36:26.645 --> 36:30.582
But you...
Aren't going anywhere.

36:35.387 --> 36:38.690
You... are a lousy kisser.

36:55.241 --> 36:57.275
No! No! No! No!

36:57.309 --> 36:59.477
No! No! No! No! No!

37:06.893 --> 37:08.559
All this time you could see.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.860
From the very first operation.

37:11.894 --> 37:12.627
Yes.

37:12.662 --> 37:13.895
How could you lie about this?

37:13.929 --> 37:18.130
It was the only protection I had.
Protection from what?

37:18.164 --> 37:21.331
Someone tried to burn down our
house with me in it, remember?

37:21.365 --> 37:25.232
If people think that you're
blind, they get careless.

37:26.266 --> 37:27.799
You see what
they don't think you can see.

37:26.801 --> 37:28.534
And you never told Toby.

37:28.601 --> 37:30.234
He was safer if he didn't know.

37:31.268 --> 37:31.968
God, you are so twisted.

37:32.002 --> 37:33.703
I wonder how I got that way?

37:35.472 --> 37:37.473
I was in your car that night.

37:37.508 --> 37:39.375
Yes, you were.
Where were you going?

37:39.410 --> 37:40.643
I was just driving.

37:40.678 --> 37:44.480
You think I enjoyed
carrying that cane?

37:44.515 --> 37:47.483
At least at night I could get out
of town, get out of rosewood,

37:47.518 --> 37:49.585
and not worry about
anybody seeing me.

37:49.620 --> 37:51.721
Yeah, but somebody did see you.

37:51.755 --> 37:54.757
Dead of night, edge of town,

37:54.792 --> 37:57.427
and Emily was just
standing there...

37:57.461 --> 37:59.696
In the middle of the road.
I almost hit her.

37:59.730 --> 38:03.232
You were drunk and crying,
talking about Maya.

38:03.267 --> 38:05.435
I couldn't just
leave you there.

38:05.469 --> 38:08.237
Yeah, she might tell
someone she saw you.

38:08.272 --> 38:10.440
Witnesses can be a bitch.

38:10.474 --> 38:13.543
She was so messed up that I thought
that she wouldn't remember,

38:13.577 --> 38:16.312
and if she did,
who would believe her?

38:16.347 --> 38:18.681
So I put you in the car and I
was going to take you home,

38:18.716 --> 38:21.217
at least to
the end of your street,

38:21.251 --> 38:24.420
but you freaked out when I stopped
at the light and jumped out of the

38:24.455 --> 38:28.124
I couldn't take any more chances.
What time was this?

38:28.158 --> 38:30.259
About twelve,
twelve-thirty.

38:34.231 --> 38:37.133
You have to promise
not to tell.

38:37.167 --> 38:39.302
That you can see?
Are you kidding?

38:39.336 --> 38:41.604
I am still a target.
For who?

38:41.638 --> 38:46.342
If I knew that, then
I wouldn't have to hide.

38:46.377 --> 38:48.644
You have to do this for me!

38:52.316 --> 38:56.386
I mean, you owe it to me, right?

38:56.420 --> 38:58.254
All of you.

39:16.607 --> 39:20.276
Hello.
Oh, hello, honey.

39:20.310 --> 39:25.148
What's all this? Hector sent everything
over from the public defender's office.

39:25.182 --> 39:27.450
I was right. Once they
had Garrett in custody,

39:27.484 --> 39:30.386
they went through every open case
they had looking for a hook.

39:30.421 --> 39:32.221
And they found some.

39:32.256 --> 39:35.358
Yeah, enough to charge him with
arson and with killing Maya.

39:35.392 --> 39:37.326
It's mostly circumstantial.

39:37.361 --> 39:39.562
And knowing the way the rosewood
police handle evidence,

39:39.596 --> 39:42.532
I'm sure I can get
everything thrown out.

39:44.601 --> 39:48.171
I'm so glad
you're enjoying yourself.

39:48.205 --> 39:52.141
He's innocent
until proven guilty.

39:52.176 --> 39:54.343
That is so good, mom. Did you
come up with that yourself?

39:54.378 --> 39:56.412
You can't speak to me
like that, Spencer.

39:56.447 --> 39:59.549
I'm sorry.
No matter how we feel,

39:59.583 --> 40:04.287
we can't let this man be railroaded
by a sloppy investigation.

40:04.321 --> 40:07.623
You know what, mom? I've been doing
some investigating of my own,

40:07.658 --> 40:10.259
and do you know what I found?

40:10.294 --> 40:12.161
When Melissa was
alone in Hanover.

40:12.196 --> 40:14.330
And she got sick
and she lost her baby,

40:14.364 --> 40:16.365
she didn't go to a hospital.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.435
There were no records.
She just stayed at the resort.

40:19.470 --> 40:22.538
Which is where
you went to go meet her.

40:22.573 --> 40:24.373
Did Melissa tell you this?

40:24.408 --> 40:28.377
No! Mom, Melissa wouldn't
tell me if my hair was on fire!

40:28.412 --> 40:31.280
She went up there
looking pregnant,

40:31.315 --> 40:33.549
and you brought her back down
not pregnant.

40:33.584 --> 40:38.554
She w <i>faking. So did you know that
before you went up to see her?</i>

40:38.589 --> 40:42.658
Is that why I wasn't
allowed to come?

40:42.693 --> 40:45.528
I didn't know
before I got there.

40:45.562 --> 40:50.366
I had some suspicions,
but I didn't know.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.569
You had some suspicions?

40:55.572 --> 40:59.442
Mom, when did Melissa
lose her baby?

40:59.476 --> 41:02.345
You'll have to ask your sister.

41:02.379 --> 41:04.647
No, mom, I am asking you.

41:19.329 --> 41:21.564
Hey. I was just about to get
something to drink.

41:21.598 --> 41:23.499
How about you?
In a minute.

41:23.534 --> 41:25.468
I need to talk to you.

41:25.502 --> 41:28.337
It was bad enough when Mrs.
Montgomery finished that test for me,

41:28.372 --> 41:30.373
but now she has you
lying about it.

41:30.407 --> 41:32.508
Mrs. Montgomery
had nothing to do with that.

41:32.543 --> 41:35.211
That was completely my idea.
Why?

41:35.245 --> 41:37.446
No. Don't tell me.
I know.

41:37.481 --> 41:40.216
You felt sorry for me.

41:40.250 --> 41:43.252
That's not what I need
from my teachers.

41:43.287 --> 41:44.720
You're right.

41:44.755 --> 41:47.557
And I don't think you would have
done it if you weren't with Aria.

41:47.591 --> 41:51.661
I've been thinking a lot about that, and
honestly, I don't know if I would have.

41:51.695 --> 41:54.630
I do know you got caught
in the middle of something,

41:54.665 --> 41:59.669
and I'm sorry if Ella and I made
things worse instead of better.

41:59.703 --> 42:02.471
Yeah. I hate to sound
ungrateful,

42:02.506 --> 42:07.476
but I am <i>really</i> getting tired of everybody
treating me like I was made out of glass.

42:14.518 --> 42:17.553
Same course, different test.

42:17.588 --> 42:19.322
Pass it now.

42:21.391 --> 42:23.225
I'll get your usual.

42:35.172 --> 42:39.442
# Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

42:39.476 --> 42:44.413
# in the eye abides the heart #

42:44.448 --> 42:49.218
# mmm-mmm-mmm
and tender feeling #

42:49.252 --> 42:54.223
# all emotions
worth revealing #

42:54.257 --> 42:59.428
# through the eyes
their charm impart #

42:59.463 --> 43:02.198
# mmm-mmm-mmm

43:02.232 --> 43:04.266
# mmm-mmm

43:04.301 --> 43:08.304
# mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm...
