WEBVTT

00:06.615 --> 00:08.660
C'mon, Rick.
We're -- We're almost there.

00:08.704 --> 00:10.836
Ugh, leave me, Morty.
It's the only way.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.795
Wha-- Were --
Wha-- Were we --

00:12.838 --> 00:14.275
Were we Blades
in that one?

00:14.318 --> 00:15.493
That's fucking tight.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.191
Just stay with me.

00:17.234 --> 00:18.975
I'm -- I'm scared,
Morty.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.107
I can see the end.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.891
I'm a silly man.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.284
I'm a silly small man.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.807
I'm -- I'm sorry
I got you into this.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.679
Then how about
I get us outta this?

00:40.692 --> 00:42.172
Hello? <i>Hey, Jessica.</i>

00:42.216 --> 00:43.565
<i>I-It's Morty.
From school.</i>

00:43.608 --> 00:45.219
Oh, hey, Morty.
What's up?

00:45.262 --> 00:47.003
Um, I just want to say
that you're really great.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.136
I know the timing never really
worked out with us,

00:49.179 --> 00:51.486
but you're really great and
I wish I got to know you better.

00:51.529 --> 00:53.314
Oh, I mean --
That's a lot.

00:53.357 --> 00:54.837
Oh, uh, yeah, sorry,
I guess I just --

00:54.880 --> 00:57.144
No, I just wish
you said it sooner.

00:57.187 --> 00:58.754
-Wh-What?
-Yeah, I mean,
being nervous

00:58.797 --> 01:00.582
is sort of selfish
sometimes, y'know?

01:00.625 --> 01:02.671
-<i>Life support systems failing.
-Yeah,
that's a great point.</i>

01:02.714 --> 01:04.325
Well, what are you
doing tonight?

01:04.368 --> 01:05.848
<i>Tonight?
Yeah.</i>

01:05.891 --> 01:07.415
Do you, like, want to watch
a movie or something?

01:07.458 --> 01:09.547
Um, yeah. Tonight.
Sounds great.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.201
Holy shit.
Holy shit.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.073
Come on, come on!

01:19.383 --> 01:21.385
Oh.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.257
-Where are we?
-We're home, Rick.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.736
I-I landed us
in the ocean.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.869
The ocean?!
The ocean on Earth?!

01:26.912 --> 01:28.740
-Uh, yeah, I-I guess so.
-Oh, shit.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.046
Holy shit.
We have to go.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.526
We have to go
right fucking now.

01:31.569 --> 01:32.875
-What?
-You touched the ocean,
Morty.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.703
What's the big --Oh, fuck. Shit.

01:34.746 --> 01:35.921
What?
Shit.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.880
Richard!

01:37.923 --> 01:40.578
You have desecrated
the sacred treaty

01:40.622 --> 01:42.189
betwixt land
and sea.

01:42.232 --> 01:45.888
Now face the wrath
of your once and eternal foe --

01:45.931 --> 01:47.237
Mr. Nimbus!

01:47.281 --> 01:49.109
Sorry.
Who is that?

01:49.152 --> 01:50.762
My nemesis.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.764
-What?
-My fucking nemesis,
okay?

01:52.808 --> 01:54.244
Okay, but what was
his name again?

01:54.288 --> 01:56.246
I am Mr. Nimbus!

01:56.290 --> 01:58.074
He's gonna
say that a lot.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.629
W-Wait, so who is
coming over again?

02:31.673 --> 02:33.805
-He said his nemesis?
-Rick has a nemesis?

02:33.849 --> 02:35.242
-I guess.
-Has hementioned him before?

02:35.285 --> 02:37.766
I-I was gonna ask you.
First I'm hearing it.

02:37.809 --> 02:39.420
Who is he?
Like a magic guy?

02:39.463 --> 02:41.030
Rick's science
and he's magic?

02:41.073 --> 02:42.640
He's like a-a fish?

02:42.684 --> 02:44.816
-A fish.
-He's not a fish.
He's Mr. Nimbus.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.471
He's king of the ocean
and he's a piece of shit.

02:47.515 --> 02:48.777
Are you happy, Morty?

02:48.820 --> 02:50.300
Are you happy you
touched the ocean?

02:50.344 --> 02:51.519
He's gonna be here
any minute.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.129
Just help me
smooth this over

02:53.173 --> 02:54.870
or this guy's gonna become
more trouble than he's worth.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.959
Um, hey, I don't know how much
I can help out tonight, Rick.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.439
Jessica's coming over
j-just to, like,

02:58.482 --> 02:59.657
watch a movie
or something,

02:59.701 --> 03:01.224
but y'know,
t-t-that's a good step.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.791
That's a solid step
to something, y'know?

03:02.834 --> 03:04.967
Truly nobody cares
about your dick, Morty.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.447
The sooner you learn that,
the better.

03:06.490 --> 03:07.709
I think you just don't
want me happy

03:07.752 --> 03:09.232
'cause then I'll stop
doing your crazy chores.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.668
Trust me,
after that ocean fuck-up,

03:10.712 --> 03:12.322
you don't get
to do anything crazy.

03:12.366 --> 03:13.628
While I bullshit
my way

03:13.671 --> 03:14.890
through this peace summit treaty
with Nimbus,

03:14.933 --> 03:17.022
Summer is gonna dive
into the Marianas Trench

03:17.066 --> 03:18.502
to recover
the forbidden shell

03:18.546 --> 03:19.721
that gives him
his power

03:19.764 --> 03:21.636
because Summer
can be trusted.

03:21.679 --> 03:22.985
Let's lick tits.

03:23.028 --> 03:24.639
-Okay, what?
-I don't love that.

03:24.682 --> 03:25.857
Of course you don't,

03:25.901 --> 03:27.163
'cause you guys
aren't getting any.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.078
Actually,
your father and I

03:29.121 --> 03:30.993
have been very
sex-positive lately.

03:31.036 --> 03:33.691
-Eww.
-Dr. Wong suggested
we experiment.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.998
We've been watching pornography.
Together.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.695
-Gross!
-I might never come back
from the ocean.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.306
Oh, you'll have to
tone it down, babe.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.656
The squares
can't handle it.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.658
There are suicide capsules
in all of your teeth.

03:43.701 --> 03:44.876
Do what you want
with that.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.182
C'mon, Morty.
You're on booze duty.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.184
Okay, Nimbus only drinks
the good shit.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.708
So just toss this
whale-ass ocean-wine in here

03:50.752 --> 03:52.014
and age it up
a few centuries.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.494
So time moves faster
in there?

03:53.537 --> 03:55.017
I-I-Is it like
a Narnia thing?

03:55.060 --> 03:57.672
I'm not a beaver who believes
in Jesus Christ, Morty.

03:57.715 --> 03:59.500
But yeah, it's pretty much
a Narnia thing.

03:59.543 --> 04:02.242
Okay,
but Jessica --All you have to do
is bring wine, Morty.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.331
When do I ask you
-for anything?
-When do you --

04:04.374 --> 04:06.724
I haven't been to
a full week of school in years!

04:06.768 --> 04:08.683
I don't know shit!
And for what?

04:08.726 --> 04:09.945
How many enemies
do you have to have?

04:09.988 --> 04:11.251
Why is everything a fight
with you?

04:11.294 --> 04:12.730
You might want to
learn this early, Morty.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.689
-Life is a fight.
-With Mr. Nimbus?

04:14.732 --> 04:15.951
Are you
makin' fun of me?

04:15.994 --> 04:17.692
Mr. Nimbus is
an ice-cold dick killer, Morty.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.652
Okay, let's go.
That's his magic ocean horn.

04:28.442 --> 04:29.747
Is that Mr. Nimbus?

04:29.791 --> 04:31.271
Nimbus.
Richard.

04:31.314 --> 04:32.533
You look like ass.

04:32.576 --> 04:33.969
Let's get this
over with.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.579
I'm sorry.
This is the guy?

04:35.623 --> 04:36.928
Jerry.
Hold on.
No.

04:36.972 --> 04:38.234
I've seen you
fuck a planet,

04:38.278 --> 04:40.758
and this is the guy
you're afraid of?

04:40.802 --> 04:42.456
I like this one,
Rick.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.371
He is unbroken.
Untamed.

04:44.414 --> 04:47.069
Perhaps he could use
a firmer grip upon his leash.

04:47.112 --> 04:48.549
Okay, that's enough.
I'm calling the police.

04:48.592 --> 04:49.724
-Go ahead.
-Jerry.

04:49.767 --> 04:50.942
I will!
Good.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.901
I control them.
Excuse me?

04:52.944 --> 04:54.598
He controls police,
Jerry.

04:54.642 --> 04:55.947
Right,
that tracks.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.819
In Dumb World.
Police?

04:57.862 --> 05:01.083
A strange horny ocean man
is on my lawn.

05:01.126 --> 05:02.432
Well, I don't see
how that's relevant,

05:02.476 --> 05:03.651
but we're white.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.307
-Freeze! Freeze!
-Freeze! Freeze!

05:07.350 --> 05:08.569
Fight.

05:10.875 --> 05:14.096
Fuck.

05:14.139 --> 05:16.359
Flee.
Let's get outta here.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.406
-Shall we, Richard?
-Okay,
but how did he --

05:19.449 --> 05:22.017
Jesus Christ, Jerry. He's Mr.
Nimbus. He controls the police!

05:22.060 --> 05:24.933
Um, hello?
Am I in the right place?

05:24.976 --> 05:27.283
I just saw a bunch of cops
having sex with each other?

05:27.327 --> 05:28.415
Hi! Jessica! Hi!

05:28.458 --> 05:29.764
Yeah, yup, y-you're
in the right spot.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.113
Uh, everyone,
th-this is Jessica.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.593
This is everybody.
Uh, this is --

05:32.636 --> 05:33.811
I am Mr. Nimbus.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.465
Jesus, Nimbus,
just get inside.

05:35.509 --> 05:36.771
Morty,
grab the wine.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.773
Yeah, in a minute.
C-C'mon, Jessica.

05:38.816 --> 05:39.991
Stand aside.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.993
Unless you are
worthy of Nimbus.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.995
If that means
what I think it means,

05:44.039 --> 05:46.433
I'll have you know,
we watch porn together.

05:46.476 --> 05:47.869
Oh!

05:47.912 --> 05:50.132
Ooh!

05:50.175 --> 05:53.135
Wow, okay! Looks like you guys
just got the nod.

05:53.178 --> 05:54.310
The nod?

05:54.354 --> 05:55.790
Mr. Nimbus
has a sense for these things.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.661
I take it you're
a sex-positive couple?

05:57.705 --> 05:59.620
Oh, yeah.
Very much so.

05:59.663 --> 06:01.012
-We watch porn together.
-Great!

06:01.056 --> 06:02.623
I'll mark you down
as eligible for a threeway.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.189
Here's all the information
you'll need.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.975
The king of the ocean wants
to have a threesome with us?

06:07.018 --> 06:08.542
Totally optional.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.718
But a remarkable option to have,
I assure you. Very jealous.

06:10.761 --> 06:11.980
There's a form
on the last page

06:12.023 --> 06:13.982
so we know where to send
the gift basket.

06:14.025 --> 06:16.027
So that just happened.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.552
You don't sound
upset about it.

06:18.595 --> 06:19.814
Neither do you.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.382
Oh, my God.
Is this happening? To us?

06:22.425 --> 06:25.167
I thought this only happened
in New York or on HBO.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.647
Dr. Wong
hasn't been wrong yet.

06:26.690 --> 06:27.996
You're right.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.998
This is exactly
what she was talking about.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.174
So, uh, yeah. J-Just make
yourself comfortable.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.176
Y'know, ch-choose a movie or --
or we can watch

06:34.219 --> 06:35.699
some interdimensional cable
if you want.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.571
<i>We now return to "Nintendo 69."</i>

06:37.614 --> 06:39.703
<i>Nintendo, oh,
what are you doing to me?</i>

06:39.747 --> 06:41.357
<i>Oh, Nintendo, oh, Nin--</i>

06:41.401 --> 06:42.924
Or we can watch whatever,
y'know.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.186
Wh-Whatever you're into.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.231
Morty, did I hear
you're getting wine?

06:46.275 --> 06:48.451
Yeah, I gotta get some wine
for Mr. Nimbus.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.670
Got any extra?

06:49.713 --> 06:51.367
Oh.
Uh, yeah.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.891
Yeah, yeah, I'll go get some,
just for you.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.980
Cool.
Hurry back.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.072
Looks like
you could use a hand.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.031
Oh, hey!
Yeah, th-th-that'd be great.

07:03.074 --> 07:05.555
No problem.
Hoovy?
Dinner's ready!

07:05.599 --> 07:07.035
Be right there,
sugar hoof!

07:07.078 --> 07:08.906
Just helping this young man
through a portal

07:08.950 --> 07:10.560
with that
crate full of alcohol

07:10.604 --> 07:13.868
that's been here
for decades.

07:13.911 --> 07:16.218
Hey, thanks, Hoovy.
I-I really appreciate that.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.394
I-I got a girl over,
and I really, really like her.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.788
-I-I'm just nervous.
-Oh, I know that feeling.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.398
When I first started
seeing Bova,

07:22.442 --> 07:25.445
I could only think about all
the ways I was gonna mess it up.

07:25.488 --> 07:28.143
-So what'd you do?
-Oh, I messed it up.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.232
But I found the one
who loves me for that.

07:30.275 --> 07:32.234
Thanks.
I-I really needed to hear that.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.410
Here,
-t-take one of these.
-Oh, you don't have to.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.065
No, I-I want to.
You have a good day, Hoovy.

07:37.108 --> 07:38.936
You have a great time
with that lady up there.

07:38.980 --> 07:41.461
Just relax.
Will do!

07:44.594 --> 07:45.726
Bova?

07:46.988 --> 07:48.903
Why did you leave us,
Father?

07:48.946 --> 07:50.426
Japheth?
When were you born?

07:51.601 --> 07:53.516
I swore to Mother
if I ever met you,

07:53.560 --> 07:54.735
I'd avenge her.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.476
It wasn't my fault.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.781
Whose, then?
Whose?!

07:57.825 --> 08:01.437
The boy
from the magic door.

08:03.570 --> 08:04.745
Shall we
discuss terms?

08:04.788 --> 08:06.311
Yeah, fine.
Whatever. Terms.

08:06.355 --> 08:09.619
Term number one --
I am King of the Ocean.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.099
The place I shit?
Go ahead.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.449
Term number two --
Stop shitting in the ocean.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.582
No idea
what you're talking about.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.279
Delicious. Another.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.586
Oh, uh, well, I-I was thinking
of using this one for --

08:19.629 --> 08:22.676
Morty, just give him the bottle.
God damn.

08:22.719 --> 08:23.938
Another!

08:23.981 --> 08:25.766
Morty,
you get the wine?

08:25.809 --> 08:27.985
Hey, Jessica.
Um, yeah, sorry.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.944
I just -- just going back
to get it.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.511
Oh.
I thought you already went.

08:31.554 --> 08:34.035
I did! I just --
just got a little busy.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.819
Going right now,
again!

08:35.863 --> 08:37.125
You go ahead
and fire up that movie!

08:37.168 --> 08:39.475
That's okay.
I'll wait for you.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.086
Holy shit, holy shit,
holy shit, holy shit!

08:44.654 --> 08:46.656
I've been waiting
for you.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.136
Oh, wow.
Hoovy, right?

08:48.179 --> 08:49.964
Never say his name!

08:50.007 --> 08:51.792
Jesus Christ!

08:51.835 --> 08:53.794
Why -- Why is every old guy
super jacked?

08:53.837 --> 08:55.230
Sorry!
I'm sorry!

08:55.273 --> 08:57.014
I-I just need the wine!
I'm sorry! Stop it!

08:57.058 --> 08:58.886
Fucking kill you!

08:58.929 --> 09:00.975
Ow!
Okay, screw this!

09:03.455 --> 09:05.980
You know what?

09:06.023 --> 09:08.504
You!
Yeah, fuck you,
Hoovy!

09:08.548 --> 09:10.027
Father?

09:10.071 --> 09:12.639
It's him!
-I told you he'd come back!
-Holy shit.

09:12.682 --> 09:15.642
Okay, look, he wasn't old
like 10 seconds ago.

09:15.685 --> 09:18.383
Ow! Mother fucker!

09:19.776 --> 09:22.649
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm sorry we never believed.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.694
He'll come back.

09:24.738 --> 09:27.392
Stop him.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.535
Papa,
why do we guard the gate?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.930
Because one day,
the dark child shall return.

09:42.973 --> 09:45.585
And we will be ready.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.284
Delicious.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.373
Where is your wine boy, Richard?
I thirst.

09:51.416 --> 09:54.724
He's getting it.
Stop eating beignets like that.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.944
Participant voids
all liability

09:56.987 --> 09:59.207
in the event
of death by orgasm?

09:59.250 --> 10:01.209
Are we really ready
to open things this wide?

10:01.252 --> 10:02.427
What if
it gets weird?

10:02.471 --> 10:03.907
What if
I fall in love with him?

10:03.951 --> 10:05.866
No, no, no, no, no.
Damn it!

10:05.909 --> 10:07.084
What was that?

10:07.128 --> 10:08.738
Another scheme of yours,
Richard?

10:08.782 --> 10:10.261
I know you're
planning something.

10:10.305 --> 10:13.134
It's nothing.
Will you excuse me, please?

10:13.177 --> 10:14.744
What the fuck is going on?
Where's the wine?

10:14.788 --> 10:16.398
Dad was horny
and I dropped it.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.878
God, I can't -- I can't believe
you're fucking this up.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.097
I'm not fucking it up! There was
a guy in the thing and --

10:20.141 --> 10:21.708
There's always a guy
in a thing!

10:21.751 --> 10:25.886
Land dwellers do not
keep Nimbus waiting and live.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.452
Be right out!
Goddammit.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.063
Do you see this whisper kitchen
"Frasier" bullshit

10:29.106 --> 10:30.934
you're making me do?
Morty, just get the wine.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.936
Beth and Jerry,
stop trying to fuck Nimbus.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.069
Well,
-we wouldn't do it here.
-I'll have you know
he propositioned us.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.114
He propositions everybody!

10:37.158 --> 10:38.420
Hey, hey, hey,
Jessica.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.117
-W-What's up?
-Seems like you're busy.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.597
No, no, no!
I ran into a little trouble.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.468
But -- But -- But I'll go get
that wine right now.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.993
But you said were going to
get it like twice already.

10:46.036 --> 10:49.257
I-I-I was
and I-I'm getting it right now.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.651
Holy shit, it's him!

10:54.654 --> 10:56.786
God damn it!
What do you want me to say?!

10:56.830 --> 10:58.614
I-I'm sorry!

11:02.139 --> 11:03.837
We finally beat him.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.665
But let's always
remain vigilant

11:05.708 --> 11:07.188
because you never know.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.103
He might be back
one day.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.713
Okay, Narnia!
Let's go.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.454
Let's fucking go!

11:12.497 --> 11:15.152
It is over.
The boy is not coming back.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.937
He always comes back.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.460
You have wasted
our lives,

11:18.503 --> 11:21.115
our very futures,
on a fantasy!

11:21.158 --> 11:23.465
A lie!
I know what I saw.

11:23.508 --> 11:24.466
You saw nothing!

11:24.509 --> 11:26.816
You are
a foolish boy!

11:29.689 --> 11:30.994
Those called fools

11:31.038 --> 11:34.955
are the only ones brave enough
to see the truth.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.673
Tell me, Father.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.153
Am I a fool now?

12:03.548 --> 12:05.202
I was born in the pits
that made these stones.

12:05.246 --> 12:08.205
I lost my years
building a temple to a lie.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.512
So I made lies
my power.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.732
And what is power
but a lie we --

12:12.775 --> 12:13.994
Aah!

12:14.037 --> 12:15.212
Oh, shit, he's real!

12:15.256 --> 12:16.997
He's real!
I was wrong!

12:17.040 --> 12:19.347
I was so wrong!
God is real!

12:39.541 --> 12:41.369
Wow.
Impeccable service.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.240
Big tip.
I liked
your other one more.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.851
What was his name?
Kyle?

12:44.894 --> 12:46.026
What?
Nothing.

12:46.069 --> 12:47.854
Can we just
sign this thing and go?

12:47.897 --> 12:50.421
Jessica,
-I-I'm so sorry.
-I mean, it's fine.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.859
You were only gone
like a couple minutes.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.034
Morty,
are you okay?

12:54.077 --> 12:55.557
I'm -- I'm sorry,
Jessica.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.646
We just never seem
to get it right, do we?

12:57.689 --> 12:59.256
No, I guess we don't.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.736
But I'm glad
you called me.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.957
Maybe we can start over,
get it right this time.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.046
Yeah.
I'd -- I'd like that.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.049
Thanks for
bringing the wine.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.877
Totally worth it.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.095
Do we need
an opener?

13:12.139 --> 13:13.749
Oh.
I'll -- I'll -- I'll go get it.

13:13.793 --> 13:14.968
Mmm.

13:15.011 --> 13:17.753
I do so love to sign
upon the dotted line.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.929
Shall we?
Jesus Christ,
yes.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.148
And who
is your witness?

13:21.191 --> 13:22.584
My witness
is the squid.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.455
Really proud of this
SeaWorld theme, aren't you?

13:24.499 --> 13:26.501
Hey, just get a witness, man.
Don't make this about me.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.416
Or perhaps
Richard has no one

13:28.459 --> 13:30.418
with whom
he can trust his life.

13:30.461 --> 13:31.941
Who truly knows him.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.247
Save me.
Fine!

13:33.290 --> 13:34.901
I'll get someone.
Oh, my God.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.425
Morty! C'mere.
I need you for some bullshit.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.905
Look, Rick, I've done
everything you've asked.

13:38.948 --> 13:41.081
Now can I just have some time
with my girlfriend?

13:41.124 --> 13:42.473
Your <i>girlfriend?</i>

13:42.517 --> 13:44.475
I mean, she's not --
we kissed,

13:44.519 --> 13:46.608
but I'm just trying
to take it slow.

13:46.651 --> 13:49.089
You gotta give these things
time to breathe, y'know?

13:52.483 --> 13:54.659
Do you know why
you're special, Adam?

13:54.703 --> 13:56.618
Because I am
-The Traveler?
-Yes.

13:56.661 --> 13:59.273
You will be the one
to pass through the door.

13:59.316 --> 14:01.623
You will be the one
to end our pain.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.104
But, Mother,
what about my pain?

14:04.147 --> 14:06.323
Your pain
shall set us free.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.325
It is time to begin.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.854
Again.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.638
Again!

14:18.553 --> 14:21.686
-You are not ready.
-Please, Mother --

14:21.730 --> 14:23.863
Do you think
he will show you mercy?

14:23.906 --> 14:25.560
Like he did to us?

14:25.603 --> 14:27.301
Again!

14:44.187 --> 14:45.319
Does anyone
need anything?

14:45.362 --> 14:47.147
Does Nimbus
need anything?

14:47.190 --> 14:48.409
Holy shit!
Don't judge.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.367
We're growing
-as a couple!
-Aah!

14:50.411 --> 14:51.934
Why is this happening
to me?!

14:51.978 --> 14:53.893
For the future!

14:55.546 --> 14:58.723
You dare
assassinate Nimbus?

14:58.767 --> 15:00.203
Sorry. Wait.
Who -- Who is that?

15:00.247 --> 15:01.422
Get in line,
pal!

15:07.384 --> 15:08.864
Such a waste.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.170
M-Mother?

15:11.998 --> 15:13.173
Aah!

15:14.652 --> 15:16.698
Jessica!

15:16.741 --> 15:19.179
You just <i>had
to touch the ocean.</i>

15:19.222 --> 15:20.528
Aaah!
Shut up!

15:20.571 --> 15:21.790
There isn't time to --

15:21.833 --> 15:24.227
It's all fucked!
And you fucked it!

15:28.101 --> 15:29.363
Huh?

15:29.406 --> 15:30.581
You're early.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.366
W-What is this place?

15:32.409 --> 15:35.021
The end.
But also a beginning.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.110
Isn't every end
a beginning?
Stay back!

15:37.153 --> 15:39.764
I don't want your stripped down
Sundance sci-fi bullshit.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.766
Where's Jessica?
Jessica.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.465
That was her name, wasn't it?
Thank you, Morty.

15:44.508 --> 15:47.468
I had forgotten.
Oh, right.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.905
You'll be needing this.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.733
For the wine.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.956
Oh, shit, we got him!

15:56.999 --> 15:59.915
Can you believe he bought
that fucking tree bullshit?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.048
We fucking got him!

16:02.091 --> 16:03.571
Very well.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.921
If you seek war with Atlantis,
you shall have it.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.836
Oh, I've already been to war
with Atlantis

16:07.879 --> 16:09.446
when I D-Day'd
that Mermaid Puss!

16:09.490 --> 16:10.665
I knew
that was you!

16:10.708 --> 16:12.623
Prepare my exit parade!

16:12.667 --> 16:15.278
Say goodbye
to your precious dry land!

16:15.322 --> 16:17.063
For soon it will be wet!
Wet!

16:17.106 --> 16:19.456
Yeah, global warming
is already doing that, asshole.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.111
But sure, yeah, go for it.
Make us slightly more wet!

16:22.155 --> 16:23.634
Am I a joke
to you?

16:23.678 --> 16:24.940
Yes,
you are a fucking joke!

16:24.984 --> 16:26.768
You fucking suck!
You've always sucked!

16:26.811 --> 16:28.639
Y-Y-Y know why
we haven't fought in years?

16:28.683 --> 16:30.076
'Cause you're an embarrassment
to me

16:30.119 --> 16:31.294
and I don't need you
anymore.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.600
I don't need anybody.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.428
All I do is eat ass
and 69 Nintendos, bro.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.038
-Every day.
-Or maybe you hate me

16:36.082 --> 16:38.649
because I am the only man
to see how far you have fallen.

16:38.693 --> 16:41.348
I used to fear you.
Respect you.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.132
Now all that's left
is pity --

16:43.176 --> 16:45.265
for a sad, drunk shell
of a man

16:45.308 --> 16:47.789
too afraid to see
how alone he truly is.

16:47.832 --> 16:50.270
If Diane were alive today,
what would she think --

16:50.313 --> 16:52.837
Don't fucking establish
canonical backstory with
me, you Red Lob--

16:52.881 --> 16:55.188
Oh, good.
You're awake.

16:55.231 --> 16:56.624
I just
took some wine!

16:56.667 --> 16:57.886
I said I was sorry.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.366
What the fuck
is wrong with you people?!

16:59.409 --> 17:01.107
I have been asking that
for centuries.

17:01.150 --> 17:04.327
I was created to study you,
Morty, to know you.

17:04.371 --> 17:05.633
But the closer
I looked,

17:05.676 --> 17:07.809
the more I do not
recognize myself.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.637
Uh, yeah, man, I really don't
have time for --

17:09.680 --> 17:12.466
I have often wondered who
would we be without you, Morty?

17:12.509 --> 17:14.642
Are we anything
beyond our hatred?

17:14.685 --> 17:15.817
And when she came,

17:15.860 --> 17:17.862
I thought
she would be the answer.

17:17.906 --> 17:20.343
Frozen in time.
Forever asleep.

17:20.387 --> 17:21.910
We could not understand
her purpose,

17:21.953 --> 17:23.172
so we hid her away.

17:23.216 --> 17:24.695
Why do we always hide
the truths we fear?

17:24.739 --> 17:26.175
I don't
give a shit, nerd!

17:26.219 --> 17:28.699
Let her go!
Why -- Why did
I clone myself genitals?

17:28.743 --> 17:30.179
Ow!
I don't care, bitch!
Do it!

17:30.223 --> 17:32.007
Ooh! Asshole!
Yeah,
guess I am an asshole!

17:32.051 --> 17:33.530
Y'know, sometimes you gotta be
an asshole!

17:33.574 --> 17:34.836
My grandpa
taught me that!

17:34.879 --> 17:36.838
Okay, okay, okay,
fine!

17:39.406 --> 17:40.711
Morty?
Hey, Jessica.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.713
Wow.
Must've been some nap, huh?

17:42.757 --> 17:45.194
I-Is that ooze or --
I'm not sure what to call it.

17:45.238 --> 17:46.848
It l-l-looks like ooze.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.155
Okay.
W-We can catch up later.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.338
What the --

17:58.381 --> 18:00.340
Rick! Rick!

18:00.383 --> 18:01.689
-...obster motherfucker.
Rick!

18:01.732 --> 18:03.125
Screw this.
What am I even doing?

18:03.169 --> 18:05.040
-Help!
-Where are you?

18:05.084 --> 18:07.869
Come back here.
I'm going to make the land wet!

18:07.912 --> 18:09.566
Y'know what,
I'd love to see it.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.046
Do it!
God, do anything!

18:11.090 --> 18:13.527
Just don't use me
as an excuse anymore!

18:13.570 --> 18:15.529
Rick!
Wow.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.226
That was intense.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.619
You look stressed.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.751
We signed
-the paperwork.
-I must go.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.188
Well, your people
have our number!

18:22.231 --> 18:23.928
Your starfish mentioned
some kind of basket?

18:23.972 --> 18:25.626
-Jesus, Morty.
-Stop! No, no!
Not today!

18:25.669 --> 18:27.889
Can't you go one day
without --You don't get to --

18:27.932 --> 18:29.804
What the --I fucked it up, okay?

18:29.847 --> 18:31.632
It's okay, Morty.
That's what you do.

18:31.675 --> 18:34.069
Now lemme Deus Ex Machina
this shit and let's go home.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.899
God, why does everyone go
Cyber-Punk Bird?

18:37.942 --> 18:39.901
So fuckin' hack.

18:41.946 --> 18:43.122
Oh, shit.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.080
Well, that's cool.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.393
Okay, we might be
a little fucked.

18:55.960 --> 18:59.442
Did you think I would
let you die alone, Richard?

19:12.629 --> 19:15.284
I am Mr. Nimbus!

19:20.028 --> 19:21.247
Wow. Phew.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.162
You -- You still got time
for that movie?

19:23.205 --> 19:25.468
Yes. Time.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.253
I had nothing
but time.

19:27.296 --> 19:28.950
Endless time.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.126
At first,
it was madness.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.301
Then enlightenment.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.824
Then madness again.

19:33.868 --> 19:36.523
But perhaps
it was a gift.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.525
I could see
the life of time.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.614
And as I watched
the life of time

19:40.657 --> 19:43.225
in all its fleeting,
terrible light,

19:43.269 --> 19:45.227
I wondered,
had I lived?

19:45.271 --> 19:47.142
Was I just the object
in another's story?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.971
Was that all I ever was?
Could I be more?

19:50.014 --> 19:53.366
I had nothing but time
and still no answer.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.672
Time without purpose
is a prison.

19:55.716 --> 19:58.284
I have glimpsed into the mind
of eternity.

19:58.327 --> 19:59.676
Perhaps the mind of God.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.984
And found
nothing but silence.

20:03.027 --> 20:05.378
I think we should
just be friends.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.640
Oh, yeah.

20:06.683 --> 20:07.858
I-I-I get that.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.643
Guess we missed
our moment.

20:09.686 --> 20:12.211
Yes.
But there will be more.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.473
For both of us.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.214
Goodbye, Morty.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.476
Hey,
how's it going?

20:16.519 --> 20:18.173
Fuck off!
I'm a Time-god!

20:18.217 --> 20:20.480
Fighting by your side again,
Richard.

20:20.523 --> 20:22.003
It was, uh --Yeah.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.657
Then there is
no treaty.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.180
Because there is
no war.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.399
Aw, Nimbus.

20:26.442 --> 20:27.661
That's --
That's really chill of you, man.

20:27.704 --> 20:28.836
Richard.

20:28.879 --> 20:31.012
Before you were
my greatest enemy,

20:31.055 --> 20:32.709
you were
my only friend.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.189
Grandpa,
-I got the shell!
-Shit.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.583
-Okay, Nimbus, look.
-You son of a bitch!

20:36.626 --> 20:38.062
-Betrayal!
-My weapons, Morty!

20:38.106 --> 20:39.586
I-I-I used them all!
Grandpa!

20:39.629 --> 20:40.848
Wait, Grandpa,
what do I do?

20:40.891 --> 20:42.241
I have the shell.
Should I blow it?

20:42.284 --> 20:43.677
Is that -- I'm --
I'm just gonna blow it!

20:43.720 --> 20:45.548
Don't blow it!
Destroy the horn!

20:45.592 --> 20:46.854
What the hell,
Summer?!

20:46.897 --> 20:48.072
You were supposed to
destroy the horn!

20:48.116 --> 20:50.292
How was I
supposed to know that?

20:52.773 --> 20:53.948
Police!

20:53.991 --> 20:56.298
Take this piece of shit
to jail.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.039
I told, ugh, I told you.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.389
He's an ice-cold
dick killer!

21:00.433 --> 21:02.348
Nimbus!

21:02.391 --> 21:03.784
Wait.
So how can he --

21:03.827 --> 21:05.699
Jesus, Summer.
He's Mr. Nimbus.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.353
He controls the police!

21:39.298 --> 21:40.951
Jer, I think
more than one safe word

21:40.995 --> 21:42.388
sort of
defeats the point.

21:42.431 --> 21:43.737
I know,
I just wanna make sure

21:43.780 --> 21:45.652
we have
every opportunity to stop.

21:45.695 --> 21:47.306
Super excited
about it though.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.264
Me too, so excited.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.962
Jerry, are we doing this
because we both want this?

21:52.006 --> 21:54.617
Or because it's what we think
the other one wants?

21:54.661 --> 21:56.619
I just wanted to prove
that I love you so much

21:56.663 --> 21:58.273
I would do this
-for you!
-Same!

21:58.317 --> 21:59.666
Let's take that prize
and get out

21:59.709 --> 22:01.798
before we make
a huge mistake.

22:01.842 --> 22:04.148
Getting cold feet?

22:04.192 --> 22:05.498
No.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.587
-Please don't tell Rick.
-He wouldn't understand.

22:07.630 --> 22:10.154
Yes, he would.
