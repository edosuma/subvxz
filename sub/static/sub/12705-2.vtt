WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.536
Mom, I'm a vampire slayer.

00:03.570 --> 00:06.307
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:06.339 --> 00:07.740
You walk out of this house,

00:07.775 --> 00:09.643
don't even think
about coming back.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.845
SNYDER: These are moments
 you want to savor.

00:11.878 --> 00:13.547
You're expelled.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.085
I love you.

00:18.118 --> 00:19.519
I love you.

00:20.553 --> 00:21.855
(groans)

00:25.792 --> 00:27.128
Buffy...

00:29.297 --> 00:31.998
WILLOW: Wouldn't it
 be great if Buffy

00:32.031 --> 00:34.101
just showed up tomorrow,
 like nothing happened?

00:34.134 --> 00:35.335
XANDER:
 She can't just show up.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.338
She got kicked out.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.805
I wonder what
she's doing right now.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.210
GILES: Joyce, you mustn't
 blame yourself for her leaving.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.444
I don't.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.378
I blame you.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.652
(dogs barking in distance)

01:19.980 --> 01:21.114
Mom?

01:21.149 --> 01:22.216
Oh!

01:22.250 --> 01:23.650
Buffy.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.718
Um...

01:25.753 --> 01:26.719
Sorry.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.590
No, no. Don't worry about it.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.424
I guess I just got used to

01:31.459 --> 01:33.760
all the quiet
while you were gone.

01:33.793 --> 01:35.061
But it's no problem.

01:35.094 --> 01:37.097
Uh, look.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.299
It's, uh, Nigerian.

01:38.331 --> 01:39.466
We got a very exciting shipment

01:39.500 --> 01:41.769
in at the gallery.

01:41.801 --> 01:43.804
I, um, thought I'd hang
a few pieces in here.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.938
It cheers up the room.

01:45.972 --> 01:47.807
It's angry at the room, Mom.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.977
It wants the room to suffer.

01:50.009 --> 01:52.646
You have no appreciation
of primitive art.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.015
You going out?

01:57.185 --> 01:58.852
Oh.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.453
Um...

02:00.487 --> 02:02.790
Well, if-if it's okay.

02:02.822 --> 02:05.426
I, um,

02:05.459 --> 02:06.993
I'd like to find
Willow and Xander.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.096
Will you be slaying?

02:09.127 --> 02:11.465
Only if they give me lip.
(chuckles)

02:11.498 --> 02:13.700
Uh, can I make you a sandwich
or something before you go?

02:13.734 --> 02:15.302
You must be starving.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.871
I was un-until
that four-course snack

02:17.905 --> 02:20.106
you served me after dinner.

02:20.139 --> 02:22.443
Well, then, um, you know,
why don't I drive you?

02:22.475 --> 02:24.812
You know, I mean,
they could be anywhere.

02:24.844 --> 02:26.280
Mom...

02:26.313 --> 02:28.549
If you don't want me to go,
just say so.

02:28.581 --> 02:30.884
No, no.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.187
I just want to put
this whole thing behind us,

02:33.221 --> 02:34.322
get back to normal.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.855
You go.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.525
Have a good time.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.192
Okay.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.408
(clattering)

03:18.265 --> 03:19.533
(bellowing)

03:23.304 --> 03:24.837
Didn't anyone ever warn you

03:24.872 --> 03:26.706
about playing
with pointy sticks?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.908
It's all fun and games
until somebody loses an eye.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.778
You shouldn't sneak up
on people like that.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.750
Geez, Buff. (chuckles)

03:36.783 --> 03:38.085
(snarling)

03:45.558 --> 03:47.527
CORDELIA: Come in, Nighthawk!
Everything okay?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.695
Nighthawk?

03:48.728 --> 03:49.930
(snarling)

03:49.962 --> 03:51.331
(grunting)

04:15.254 --> 04:16.923
Oh, hey, Buffy.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.370
Hey, guys.

04:36.709 --> 04:40.581
(wolf howling)

04:40.613 --> 04:43.016
*

05:32.865 --> 05:34.567
BUFFY: You know,
 maybe it's too late.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.903
Maybe we should just
come back tomorrow.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.576
What if he's mad?

05:42.610 --> 05:44.812
Mad? Just because
you ran away

05:44.845 --> 05:46.980
and abandoned your post
and your friends and your mom

05:47.014 --> 05:49.582
and made him lay awake
every night worrying about you?

05:49.617 --> 05:52.084
Maybe we should
wait out here.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.923
(sighs)

05:56.956 --> 05:58.459
(sighs)

06:09.569 --> 06:11.370
Check it out. The watcher
is back on the clock.

06:11.404 --> 06:14.908
(chuckles) And just when you
were thinking career change,

06:14.942 --> 06:17.244
maybe becoming
a-a looker or a seer.

06:17.276 --> 06:18.446
Thank you, Xander.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.382
Welcome home, Buffy.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.120
I got in a few hours ago,

06:28.154 --> 06:30.057
but I went to go
see my mom first.

06:30.089 --> 06:32.625
Yes. Yes, of course.
How did you find her?

06:32.659 --> 06:34.795
Well, I pretty much
remembered the address.

06:34.827 --> 06:36.262
I mean, uh...

06:36.295 --> 06:39.399
How are things between you?

06:39.432 --> 06:40.266
(tea kettle whistles)

06:40.300 --> 06:41.735
Ah. Excuse me.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.738
Hey, so you're not wanted
for murder anymore.

06:45.773 --> 06:46.874
Good.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.742
That was such a drag.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.377
So where were you?

06:50.409 --> 06:52.278
Did you go to Belgium?

06:52.312 --> 06:54.747
Why would I go to Belgium?

06:54.781 --> 06:57.918
I think the relevant question
is why wouldn't you?

06:57.951 --> 06:59.487
Belgium!

06:59.519 --> 07:01.120
(laughter)

07:01.153 --> 07:03.389
BUFFY: What about you, Xander?
What's up with you?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.324
XANDER: Oh, you know.
Same old, same old.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.927
Hardly.
Okay, I lied. A whole lot.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.129
BUFFY: Well, that's good,
isn't it? New is good.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.365
XANDER: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Except for the obvious...

07:14.134 --> 07:15.268
BUFFY: Yeah,
'cause you weren't...

07:15.302 --> 07:16.803
(clears throat)

07:16.836 --> 07:19.305
XANDER: Cordelia's parents
are on a luxury vacation.

07:19.338 --> 07:20.406
BUFFY: I feel for you.

07:20.439 --> 07:22.610
Here we are then.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.478
Cheer us up.

07:26.646 --> 07:28.949
CORDELIA: So were you, like,
living in a box or what?

07:28.981 --> 07:32.252
Well, it's a long story.

07:32.284 --> 07:34.021
So skip the heartwarming stuff
about kindly old people

07:34.053 --> 07:36.423
and saving the farm
and get right to the dirt.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.326
Perhaps Buffy could use
a little time to adjust

07:39.358 --> 07:41.862
before we grill her
on her summer activities.

07:41.894 --> 07:43.295
What he said.

07:43.329 --> 07:44.665
Fair enough.

07:44.697 --> 07:46.365
In fact, you can leave
the slaying to us

07:46.399 --> 07:48.300
while you settle in.
We got you covered.

07:48.334 --> 07:49.637
I noticed.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.639
You guys seem down
with the slayage,

07:51.672 --> 07:53.305
all tricked out with
your walkies and everything.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.175
Yeah, but the outfits suck.

07:55.207 --> 07:57.377
This whole rambo thing
is so over.

07:57.409 --> 08:01.180
I'm thinking more sporty,
like Hilfiger maybe.

08:01.213 --> 08:02.214
Still, we were getting good.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.382
We dusted nine out of ten.

08:03.415 --> 08:04.384
Six out of ten.

08:04.416 --> 08:05.985
Six out of ten.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.487
Whatever, we were kicking
a little undead booty.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.356
Well, thank you for the offer,

08:10.389 --> 08:11.992
But I think i just want to get
back to my normal routine.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.793
You know, school,
slaying--

08:13.826 --> 08:15.528
kid's stuff.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.665
In fact, I'm jonesing
for a little brainless fun.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.199
What are you doing tomorrow?

08:20.733 --> 08:23.836
Oh, I would, but, um,
I'm kind of tied up.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.237
You wish.

08:26.038 --> 08:28.007
Wil?

08:28.040 --> 08:29.341
Um, tomorrow I...

08:29.375 --> 08:31.043
Oh, come on.

08:31.077 --> 08:32.745
Friends don't let
friends browse alone.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.380
WILLOW:
Okay. I had some schoolwork,

08:34.413 --> 08:37.484
but I can change my plans.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.485
As for school, Buffy, uh,

08:39.519 --> 08:42.522
you know you'll have to talk
to Principal Snyder before...

08:42.556 --> 08:46.259
On it. Mom is making an
appointment with His Ugliness.

08:46.293 --> 08:49.328
I know she can break him.

08:49.361 --> 08:50.230
Absolutely not.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.264
Under no circumstances.

08:52.298 --> 08:54.366
But you can't
keep her out of school.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.769
You don't have the right.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.437
I have not only the right,

08:58.471 --> 09:00.874
but also a nearly physical
sensation of pleasure

09:00.908 --> 09:03.711
at the thought
of keeping her out of school.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.211
I'd describe myself as tingly.

09:05.245 --> 09:08.548
Buffy was cleared
of all those charges.

09:08.581 --> 09:10.517
Yes, and while she may live up

09:10.549 --> 09:13.220
to the not-a-murderer
requirement for enrollment,

09:13.253 --> 09:15.054
she is a troublemaker,

09:15.087 --> 09:16.624
destructive
to school property

09:16.657 --> 09:18.191
and the occasional student.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.458
And her grade point average

09:19.491 --> 09:20.927
is enough to...

09:22.328 --> 09:23.797
I'm sorry.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.097
Another tingle moment.

09:25.131 --> 09:26.700
I don't see how
you can be so cavalier

09:26.734 --> 09:28.969
about a young girl's
entire future!

09:29.001 --> 09:30.470
I'm quite sure that a girl

09:30.503 --> 09:32.139
with the talents
and abilities of Buffy

09:32.172 --> 09:34.607
will land on her feet.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.911
In fact, I noticed
as I came in this morning

09:37.945 --> 09:40.913
that Hot Dog on a Stick
is hiring.

09:40.947 --> 09:43.616
You will look so cute
in that hat.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.585
Let's go, Mom.

09:48.788 --> 09:49.956
This isn't over.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.258
If I have to,

09:51.290 --> 09:53.159
I'll go all the way
to the mayor.

09:55.495 --> 09:56.897
Wouldn't that be interesting.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.099
(door closes)

10:03.370 --> 10:05.337
Don't worry
about school, honey.

10:05.371 --> 10:07.340
If we can't get you
back into Sunnydale,

10:07.374 --> 10:09.576
maybe we can swing
private school.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.744
Private school?

10:10.778 --> 10:12.846
You mean,
like jackets and kilts?

10:12.879 --> 10:14.447
You want me to get
field hockey knees?

10:14.480 --> 10:16.249
It's not that bad.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.985
What about home schooling?

10:18.018 --> 10:20.854
You know, it's not just for
scary religious people anymore.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.322
We'll work something out.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.623
Okay?

10:24.991 --> 10:26.894
Say hi to Willow?

11:07.735 --> 11:09.702
Oh, my word.

11:09.736 --> 11:11.705
Oh, you must be Buffy.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.472
Look at you.

11:13.505 --> 11:15.241
Aren't you a picture?

11:15.274 --> 11:17.177
Thank you.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.479
Oh, I'm Pat,
from your mom's book club.

11:19.511 --> 11:21.048
I'm sure she mentioned me.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.581
Actually...

11:22.615 --> 11:24.350
I, um, I sort of took it
upon myself

11:24.384 --> 11:26.352
to look after her
while you were,

11:26.385 --> 11:27.888
you know, off and away
or what have you and,

11:27.921 --> 11:31.024
well, between, uh,

11:31.057 --> 11:33.426
your situation and
reading Deep End of the Ocean,

11:33.460 --> 11:35.562
she was, uh,
she was just a wreck.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.096
You can imagine.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.731
Anyway, I'm off.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.801
We're making empanadas
in my Spanish class tonight.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.203
You go be with your mom.

11:44.236 --> 11:45.638
You two need to rebond.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.546
Pat wishes us quality time.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.414
Oh. I met her in a...

11:55.447 --> 11:57.017
Book club.
Yeah.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.684
Got it.

11:58.717 --> 12:01.354
Oh, uh, before I forget,
uh, Willow just called.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.389
Where was she?

12:03.423 --> 12:06.894
She-she got held up,
but she said she tried to call.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.962
Was there a message?

12:09.996 --> 12:11.398
No.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.134
But I had a thought.

12:15.168 --> 12:19.272
What if I invited Willow
and Mr. Giles and everybody over

12:19.306 --> 12:20.639
for dinner tomorrow night?

12:20.673 --> 12:23.876
Don't you think
that would be nice?

12:23.911 --> 12:26.212
Since I sort of already did,

12:26.245 --> 12:28.181
I was hoping for a yes.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.152
It'll be fun.

12:32.184 --> 12:33.753
Great.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.288
Uh, do me a favor?

12:35.322 --> 12:37.490
Run down and get
the company plates.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.961
Mom, Willow and everybody

12:40.994 --> 12:42.461
aren't company-plate people.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.463
They're normal-plate people.

12:44.496 --> 12:46.265
We never have guests
for dinner.

12:46.298 --> 12:47.967
Indulge your mother?

13:15.662 --> 13:17.163
(gasps)

13:21.033 --> 13:22.735
(groans)

13:24.803 --> 13:26.173
Next time, I get to pick

13:26.206 --> 13:28.174
the mother-daughter
bonding activity.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.783
Do you want
to say something?

13:37.817 --> 13:40.519
Like what, thanks
for stopping by and dying?

13:40.552 --> 13:42.022
How about, um...

13:42.054 --> 13:44.657
Good-bye, stray cat,
who lost its way.

13:44.691 --> 13:47.226
We hope you find it.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.673
*

14:14.421 --> 14:16.855
*

14:35.774 --> 14:38.144
*

14:53.426 --> 14:55.294
(meowing)

15:09.908 --> 15:12.312
*

15:27.293 --> 15:29.696
*

15:49.982 --> 15:51.283
I thought they'd be here.

15:51.317 --> 15:53.286
They are.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.854
They're waiting for you.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.857
Am I dreaming?

15:58.890 --> 16:01.327
(chuckles) I'm probably
the wrong person to ask.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.697
You'd better go.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.535
I'm afraid.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.303
You should be.

16:18.845 --> 16:22.014
(school bell ringing)

16:22.048 --> 16:23.482
(alarm buzzing)

16:31.191 --> 16:32.558
JOYCE:
I've been on the phone

16:32.591 --> 16:35.062
with the, uh,
superintendent of schools.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.063
At least he seems
more reasonable

16:37.096 --> 16:39.865
than that nasty little
horrid, bigoted rodent man.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.734
Mom.

16:41.768 --> 16:45.337
Anyway I'm going in to speak
with him this afternoon.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.673
Uh, as for private schools,

16:46.706 --> 16:48.740
um, Miss Porter's accepts
late admissions.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.711
I, uh, I wrote
the information down for you.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.346
A girls' school?

16:53.379 --> 16:56.149
So now it's jackets,
kilts and no boys?

16:56.182 --> 16:59.251
Care to throw in
a little foot-binding?

16:59.286 --> 17:00.687
Buffy,

17:00.720 --> 17:03.155
you made some bad choices.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.924
You just might have to live
with some consequences.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.762
Nothing's settled yet.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.000
I just wish

17:14.031 --> 17:15.934
you didn't have to be
so secretive about things.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.836
I mean, it's not your fault
you have a special circumstance.

17:17.868 --> 17:19.005
They should make
allowances for you.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.874
Mom, I'm a slayer.

17:21.906 --> 17:24.777
It's not like I need to ride
the little bus to school.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.413
Couldn't you just
tell a few people,

17:26.444 --> 17:27.913
like Principal Snyder

17:27.945 --> 17:30.349
and maybe the police?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.919
I mean, I would think they
would be happy to have a...

17:32.951 --> 17:35.587
(chuckles) A superhero.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.923
Is that the right term?

17:37.957 --> 17:39.025
I mean, it's not offensive,
is it?

17:39.057 --> 17:39.759
(gasps)
(meowing)

17:45.765 --> 17:48.134
Welcome to
the Hellmouth petting zoo.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.807
(growling, meowing)

17:54.840 --> 17:57.144
Oh, my God,
what a stench.

17:57.176 --> 18:01.047
You know, I wanted
Forest Pine or April Fresh,

18:01.079 --> 18:02.815
but mom wanted Dead Cat.

18:02.848 --> 18:05.817
I'll...

18:05.852 --> 18:07.220
(groans)

18:07.253 --> 18:08.755
I'll get it
back to the library,

18:08.788 --> 18:11.624
see if we can determine
its exact origin.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.064
That's, uh, striking

18:18.096 --> 18:19.999
and... Nigerian.
Oh.

18:20.031 --> 18:22.269
Yes. I have
this wonderful dealer

18:22.301 --> 18:23.635
who specializes
in ancient artifacts--

18:23.670 --> 18:26.338
You know, I love art talk

18:26.373 --> 18:28.240
as much as the next
very dull person,

18:28.275 --> 18:30.742
but we have work to do, Giles.
Research mode.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.345
Sh-shouldn't you stay
with your mother,

18:32.378 --> 18:33.512
perhaps, Buffy?
I mean, you must have...

18:33.546 --> 18:34.913
Please, no.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.848
It's fine. She can go with you.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.285
Actually, she can't.

18:38.317 --> 18:40.186
Um...

18:40.220 --> 18:42.255
You're not allowed
on school property.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.022
Oh.

18:44.056 --> 18:44.957
I'm sorry.

18:44.990 --> 18:47.693
Um, uh...

18:47.727 --> 18:52.598
I'll-I'll call as soon
as I know something.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.032
Oh, we'll see you tonight?

18:54.066 --> 18:55.201
Tonight, then. Yes.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.536
(snarling, meowing)

18:58.904 --> 19:00.940
(meowing)

19:00.972 --> 19:03.142
It looks dead.

19:03.175 --> 19:04.510
It smells dead.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.878
Yet it's moving around.

19:08.079 --> 19:09.048
That's interesting.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.049
Nice pet, Giles.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.051
Don't you like
anything regular?

19:13.085 --> 19:15.887
Golf, USA Today,
or anything?

19:15.922 --> 19:18.857
I'm trying to find out how
and why it rose from the grave.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.393
It's not as if I'm gonna
take it home

19:20.426 --> 19:22.060
and offer it
a saucer of warm milk.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.863
Well, I like it.

19:23.895 --> 19:26.232
I think you should
call it Patches.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.300
What about Buffy's
welcome home dinner tonight?

19:28.335 --> 19:32.003
I had told her mom
we'd help out. Bring stuff.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.405
I'm the dip.

19:35.375 --> 19:38.244
Uh, you got to admire
the purity of it. (chuckles)

19:38.278 --> 19:40.078
What? Onion dip.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.048
Stirring, not cooking.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.650
It's what I bring.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.986
We should figure out
what kind of deal this is.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.855
I mean, is it a gathering,
a shindig, or a hootenanny?

19:51.391 --> 19:52.659
What's the difference?

19:52.692 --> 19:53.826
Well, a gathering is brie,

19:53.859 --> 19:55.494
mellow song stylings.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.028
Shindig, dip,

19:57.063 --> 19:58.931
less mellow song stylings,

19:58.964 --> 20:01.233
perhaps a large amount
of malt beverage,

20:01.268 --> 20:03.702
and hootenanny,
well, it's chock full of hoot,

20:03.736 --> 20:05.404
just a little bit of nanny.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.006
Well, I hate brie.

20:07.038 --> 20:09.541
I know. It smells
like Giles' cat.

20:09.576 --> 20:10.843
It's not my...

20:10.876 --> 20:12.545
And what'll we talk about
at a gathering anyway?

20:12.578 --> 20:14.681
"So, Buffy, did you meet
any nice pimps on your travels?

20:14.713 --> 20:16.182
"And oh, by the by,

20:16.214 --> 20:17.717
"thanks for ruining our lives

20:17.750 --> 20:19.751
for the past three months."
Xander.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.354
You know what I mean.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.721
She doesn't want
to talk about it,

20:22.755 --> 20:24.557
we don't want
to talk about it,

20:24.590 --> 20:26.057
so why don't we just
shut up and dance?

20:26.092 --> 20:28.094
Well, Buffy said she did
want to loosen up,

20:28.126 --> 20:29.561
you know, have some kid time.

20:29.596 --> 20:32.230
Aren't you guys
rehearsing tonight?

20:32.265 --> 20:33.732
Why don't you play
at the party?

20:33.766 --> 20:35.968
Yeah, I think I could
supply some Dingo action.

20:36.001 --> 20:39.471
I'm not sure that,
a, um... shindig...

20:39.506 --> 20:41.374
Hootenanny.

20:41.407 --> 20:44.076
...hootenanny is really
the order of the day.

20:44.109 --> 20:46.778
Maybe something
a little more intimate.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.780
I mean, Buffy has
just got home.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.617
I'm sure she's still feeling
a little disoriented.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.287
All the more reason
to make her feel welcome,

20:54.320 --> 20:56.756
and a big party says,
"Welcome, Buffy."

20:56.788 --> 20:58.724
Okay, so one vote
from the old guy

20:58.758 --> 21:00.559
for a smelly-cheese
night,

21:00.593 --> 21:03.296
and how many votes
for actual fun, huh?

21:05.464 --> 21:08.134
All right, all right.
Have it your way.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.435
I'm just glad
to have her home.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.170
(meowing)

21:11.202 --> 21:14.039
Now things can get
back to normal.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.151
(doorbell rings)

21:38.029 --> 21:39.999
Hey, there you are!

21:40.031 --> 21:43.001
Not thinking about any more
flights of fancy, I hope.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.203
Joyce said there was room
for one more,

21:45.237 --> 21:49.040
so I said forget facial night
and let's party!

21:49.075 --> 21:51.309
I bet you like empanadas.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.147
Do you want to see my mom?

21:56.182 --> 21:57.983
Please.
Mom!

21:59.018 --> 22:01.953
Oh, Pat. Good.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.288
Buffy, I hope you don't mind.

22:03.321 --> 22:04.391
Hi!
Hi!

22:04.423 --> 22:06.593
(doorbell rings)
You look great.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.029
Hey, Buffy. So where do you
want the band to set up?

22:11.063 --> 22:12.865
What? The band?

22:14.232 --> 22:16.603
(rock song playing)

22:27.346 --> 22:29.715
(indistinct chatter)

22:37.088 --> 22:38.324
Hey!

22:38.356 --> 22:39.625
Hey!

22:41.093 --> 22:42.929
This is large!

22:42.961 --> 22:44.262
You like?

22:44.296 --> 22:45.832
Yeah.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.067
It's great.

22:48.099 --> 22:51.703
I was just sort of hoping
it would be... us.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.472
Sorry. What?

22:55.240 --> 22:57.743
This is amazing,
but I was sort of hoping

22:57.777 --> 23:00.779
we could just hang together,
the gang.

23:08.253 --> 23:11.590
* Too many saviors

23:12.924 --> 23:16.863
* And I won't die

23:16.895 --> 23:19.432
* I've never cried

23:19.465 --> 23:25.171
* But I needed more from you

23:26.305 --> 23:30.142
* I've found my life

23:30.175 --> 23:33.244
* Without you now

23:33.278 --> 23:36.147
* And I'd never mind

23:36.182 --> 23:38.250
* I'm only half as blind...

23:38.284 --> 23:39.486
Is everything okay?

23:41.453 --> 23:43.923
You-you seem to be avoiding me,

23:43.955 --> 23:45.124
in the one-on-one sense.

23:45.156 --> 23:47.159
What?

23:47.192 --> 23:48.795
This isn't avoiding.

23:48.827 --> 23:52.097
See? Here you are, here I am.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.766
So we're cool?

23:53.799 --> 23:54.933
Way!

23:54.967 --> 23:56.903
That's why, with the party,

23:56.935 --> 23:59.438
'cause we're all glad
you're back.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.807
Okay.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.609
Okay. Good.

24:03.643 --> 24:06.178
* I see my reflection

24:06.211 --> 24:09.981
* Never flinch
from your eyes... *

24:19.491 --> 24:21.426
(indistinct chatter)

24:21.460 --> 24:23.863
(indistinct radio transmissions)

24:36.241 --> 24:37.777
* But I won't hang

24:37.809 --> 24:41.313
* I can feel you
covet my faith *

24:41.346 --> 24:44.282
* I've said another lie,
I know why *

24:44.316 --> 24:46.018
* I don't want to sway...

24:46.051 --> 24:47.854
XANDER:
Hey, Buff, uh...

24:47.886 --> 24:49.822
What are you doing?

24:49.855 --> 24:53.325
I was just taking a break
from all this wacky fun.

24:53.358 --> 24:55.027
Some kind of party, huh?

24:55.060 --> 24:57.395
I guess a lot of people
are glad to have you back.

24:57.429 --> 25:00.700
It seems like people
I didn't even know missed me.

25:02.401 --> 25:04.903
Did Giles say he was
going to be late?

25:04.936 --> 25:07.205
Uh, he was library man
last time I saw him.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.375
But he'll be here. He wants
to celebrate your homecoming.

25:09.407 --> 25:11.844
We all do. I mean, it's great
to have the Buffster back.

25:13.412 --> 25:14.413
(chuckles) Isn't it?

25:14.445 --> 25:15.847
Totally!

25:15.882 --> 25:18.250
Except you were kind
of turning me on

25:18.284 --> 25:20.219
with that whole
boy slayer look.

25:20.251 --> 25:22.654
XANDER:
Was I now?

25:22.689 --> 25:24.256
You bet, Nighthawk.

25:24.289 --> 25:26.357
(giggling)

25:31.029 --> 25:32.664
Well, I'll just be, uh...

25:32.699 --> 25:35.134
Oh, yeah.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.575
Breathe.

25:44.810 --> 25:47.512
Breathe.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.182
All right, look, these burns
are too extensive.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.784
It's 7:43.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.419
Let's call it.

26:00.491 --> 26:01.627
WOMAN:
Oh, my God!

26:01.661 --> 26:03.561
(grunting, crashing)

26:10.435 --> 26:12.904
MAN: Hey, what's the deal
with this party anyway?

26:12.939 --> 26:14.874
MAN 2: This party?

26:14.906 --> 26:17.743
Heard it was for some chick
that just got out of rehab.

26:32.357 --> 26:33.925
Whew.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.730
Now, how you holding up,
Joyce, hmm?

26:37.763 --> 26:39.898
Really.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.634
Really? I'm...

26:42.669 --> 26:44.636
I don't know.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.137
While Buffy was gone,

26:46.172 --> 26:48.240
all I could think about
was getting her home.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.576
I just knew that if I could
put my arms around her

26:50.608 --> 26:52.010
and tell her how much
I loved her,

26:52.044 --> 26:53.578
everything would be okay.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.947
But?

26:54.980 --> 26:56.414
JOYCE:
Having Buffy home,

26:56.448 --> 26:58.483
I thought it was going
to make it all better,

26:58.517 --> 27:01.688
but in some ways,
it's almost worse.

27:13.499 --> 27:14.666
(sniffling)

27:34.353 --> 27:36.722
*

27:43.662 --> 27:46.031
(groaning)

27:57.876 --> 27:59.846
(meowing)

28:06.018 --> 28:07.519
Oh, Lord!

28:25.971 --> 28:27.874
(dialing)

28:29.875 --> 28:31.877
(line ringing)

28:34.913 --> 28:36.281
(phone ringing)

28:47.625 --> 28:50.628
Party Villa,
can I rock you?

28:50.662 --> 28:52.597
I-I-I need to speak with Buffy.

28:52.631 --> 28:54.266
Um, immediately!

28:54.299 --> 28:56.903
I have some information
that is extremely important.

28:56.935 --> 28:58.537
(glass shattering)

28:58.569 --> 29:00.405
Yeah! Fiesta foul!

29:00.439 --> 29:02.942
You gotta do a shot!

29:02.974 --> 29:04.710
I need to speak to Buffy!

29:04.742 --> 29:05.743
Now!

29:05.778 --> 29:07.445
Bunny?

29:07.479 --> 29:09.448
That guy's gotta do a shot.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.116
GILES: Buffy!

29:11.150 --> 29:13.618
Hey! I need
to talk to a Buddy.

29:13.652 --> 29:15.686
Is there a Buddy here?

29:17.655 --> 29:19.057
Sorry. He's not here.

29:19.090 --> 29:22.461
You got the wrong casa,
Mr. Belvedere.

29:22.493 --> 29:24.462
H-Hello?

29:24.496 --> 29:26.632
Hello?

29:26.664 --> 29:28.299
(slams phone down)

29:32.671 --> 29:35.106
(cat snarling and hissing)

29:45.050 --> 29:46.952
You're leaving again?

29:47.953 --> 29:49.488
What, you just stopped by

29:49.520 --> 29:51.156
for your lint brush
and now you're ready to go?

29:51.190 --> 29:54.093
It's not like
anyone will mind.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.661
Oh, no. Have a great time.

29:55.693 --> 29:58.029
Oh, and don't forget
to not write.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.698
Why are you attacking me?

29:59.730 --> 30:01.767
I'm trying.

30:01.799 --> 30:04.435
Wow, and it looks
so much like giving up.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.605
I'm just trying
to make things easier.

30:06.637 --> 30:07.839
For who?

30:07.874 --> 30:09.976
You guys were doing just
fine without me.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.643
We were doing the best we could.

30:11.676 --> 30:14.180
It's not like we had
a lot of choice in the matter.

30:14.212 --> 30:16.647
Sorry that I had to leave,

30:16.682 --> 30:18.884
but you don't know
what I was going through.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.318
Well, I'd like to.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.653
You wouldn't understand.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.625
Well, maybe I don't need
to understand.

30:26.657 --> 30:30.997
Maybe I-I just need you
to talk to me.

30:31.029 --> 30:33.531
How could I talk to you
when you were avoiding me?

30:33.565 --> 30:35.000
This isn't easy, Buffy.

30:35.034 --> 30:38.037
I know you're
going through stuff,

30:38.069 --> 30:40.239
but... so am I.

30:40.271 --> 30:42.807
I know that you were
worried about me, but...

30:42.840 --> 30:45.010
No! I don't just mean that.

30:45.044 --> 30:47.378
I mean, my life.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.579
You know?

30:48.614 --> 30:51.517
I-I'm having all sorts of...

30:51.549 --> 30:52.651
I'm dating.

30:52.683 --> 30:54.552
I'm having serious dating

30:54.586 --> 30:56.654
with a werewolf,

30:56.688 --> 30:59.590
and I'm studying witchcraft

30:59.625 --> 31:01.928
and-and killing vampires,

31:01.961 --> 31:03.595
and I didn't have
anyone to talk to

31:03.628 --> 31:05.730
about all this

31:05.763 --> 31:08.099
scary life stuff.

31:09.300 --> 31:12.538
And you were my best friend.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.345
Unbelievable.

31:19.377 --> 31:20.746
"Do you like my mask?

31:20.778 --> 31:21.613
"Isn't it pretty?

31:21.646 --> 31:24.215
It raises the dead."

31:24.250 --> 31:26.551
Americans.

31:27.419 --> 31:28.720
Geez!

31:28.753 --> 31:30.122
(tires screeching)

31:33.259 --> 31:35.461
My God.

31:35.493 --> 31:37.628
Are you all right?

31:37.663 --> 31:39.298
Are you hurt?

31:43.801 --> 31:44.971
(muttering)

31:45.003 --> 31:46.738
(groaning)

31:52.278 --> 31:55.047
You have no idea
how much I missed you.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.647
Everyone.

31:56.682 --> 32:00.286
I wanted to call every day.

32:00.318 --> 32:01.920
That doesn't matter, Buffy.

32:01.953 --> 32:03.321
It doesn't make it okay
that you didn't.

32:03.355 --> 32:04.522
What is this?

32:05.958 --> 32:08.160
Is this some
sort of a joke?

32:08.193 --> 32:10.229
Mom, please, could you just...

32:10.261 --> 32:11.329
No, I can't just.

32:11.363 --> 32:14.566
Buffy, what is this?

32:14.599 --> 32:16.402
She was running away again.

32:16.434 --> 32:17.803
No, I wasn't.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.838
I'm not sure.

32:20.872 --> 32:23.808
Well, you better get sure
and explain yourself right away.

32:23.842 --> 32:26.178
If you think you can just take
off any time you feel like...

32:26.211 --> 32:27.613
Stop it!

32:27.645 --> 32:28.946
Please!

32:28.980 --> 32:30.615
I don't know.

32:30.648 --> 32:33.051
I don't know
what I'm doing.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.957
(rock song playing)

32:38.990 --> 32:41.426
Don't you leave
this house, young lady!

32:41.460 --> 32:42.827
You know what? That's it.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.962
You and I are
going to have a talk.

32:44.997 --> 32:46.932
Mom, please.

32:46.964 --> 32:48.534
You know what?
I don't care.

32:48.567 --> 32:49.867
I don't care what
your friends think of me

32:49.901 --> 32:51.436
or you for that matter,

32:51.470 --> 32:53.005
because you put me
through the wringer, Buffy.

32:53.038 --> 32:54.339
I mean it.

32:54.373 --> 32:55.941
And I've had Schnapps.

32:55.973 --> 32:57.843
Do you have any idea
what it's been like?

32:57.875 --> 32:59.545
Mom, this isn't the time.

32:59.577 --> 33:02.614
You can't imagine
months of not knowing,

33:02.647 --> 33:06.684
not knowing whether you're
lying dead in a ditch somewhere

33:06.718 --> 33:08.987
or, I don't know, living it up.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.655
But you told me!

33:10.689 --> 33:12.523
You're the one
who said I should go.

33:12.557 --> 33:14.492
You said if I leave this house,
don't come back!

33:14.526 --> 33:15.861
You found out who I really was,

33:15.894 --> 33:17.195
and you couldn't deal.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.630
Don't you remember?

33:18.663 --> 33:19.830
Buffy, you didn't
give me time.

33:19.865 --> 33:21.866
You just dumped
this thing on me,

33:21.900 --> 33:23.169
and you expected me
to get it.

33:23.201 --> 33:25.471
Well, guess what.
Mom's not perfect, okay?

33:25.503 --> 33:26.904
I handled it badly.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.574
But that doesn't give you
the right

33:28.606 --> 33:30.041
to punish me by running away.

33:30.076 --> 33:32.544
Punish you? I didn't do this
to punish you.

33:32.577 --> 33:33.912
Well, you did.

33:33.944 --> 33:35.314
You should've seen
what you put her through.

33:35.346 --> 33:36.582
Great. Thanks.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.884
Anybody else want to
weigh in here?

33:38.916 --> 33:40.086
How about you by the dip?

33:41.287 --> 33:42.320
No, thanks.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.021
I'm good.

33:44.056 --> 33:47.025
You know, maybe you don't
want to hear it, Buffy,

33:47.058 --> 33:49.394
but taking off like you did was
incredibly selfish and stupid.

33:49.427 --> 33:52.163
Okay. Okay. I screwed up.
I know this.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.232
But you have no idea!

33:54.266 --> 33:56.902
You have, you have no idea
what happened to me

33:56.934 --> 33:58.670
or what I was feeling!

33:58.703 --> 34:00.571
Did you even
try talking to anybody?

34:00.605 --> 34:02.540
There was nothing
that anybody could do, okay?

34:02.574 --> 34:04.609
I just had to deal
with this on my own.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.912
Yeah, and you see how well
that one worked out.

34:06.944 --> 34:08.547
You can't just
bury stuff, Buffy.

34:08.579 --> 34:10.047
It'll come right back up
to get you.

34:10.081 --> 34:13.652
(groaning)

34:31.737 --> 34:33.838
Oh, good show, Giles.

34:47.686 --> 34:48.887
(engine starts)

34:48.920 --> 34:51.322
Like riding a bloody bicycle.

34:56.927 --> 34:58.929
As if I even could've
gone to you, Xander.

34:58.963 --> 35:02.000
You made your feelings about
Angel and I perfectly clear.

35:02.032 --> 35:04.170
Look, I'm sorry that
your honey was a demon,

35:04.202 --> 35:07.672
but most girls don't hop
a Greyhound over boy troubles.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.275
Time out, Xander.

35:09.307 --> 35:11.409
Put yourself in Buffy's shoes
for just a minute.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.844
Okay?

35:12.878 --> 35:15.646
I'm Buffy,
freak of nature, right?

35:15.681 --> 35:17.648
Naturally I pick a freak
for a boyfriend,

35:17.682 --> 35:19.751
and then he turns
into Mr. Killing Spree,

35:19.784 --> 35:21.353
which is pretty much
my fault...

35:21.387 --> 35:24.356
Cordy, get out of my shoes.

35:24.389 --> 35:26.090
I'm just trying
to help, Buffy.

35:26.123 --> 35:27.293
Buffy, you never--

35:27.326 --> 35:28.594
Willow, please.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.128
I can't take this from you, too.

35:30.161 --> 35:31.329
XANDER:
Let her finish!

35:31.362 --> 35:33.998
You at least owe her that.

35:34.032 --> 35:36.302
God, Xander, do you think
you could at least

35:36.335 --> 35:38.603
stick to annoying me
on your own behalf?

35:38.637 --> 35:41.106
Fine. You stop acting
like an idiot,

35:41.139 --> 35:42.974
I'll stop annoying you.

35:43.007 --> 35:46.211
Oh, you want to talk
acting like an idiot,

35:46.244 --> 35:47.612
Nighthawk?

35:47.646 --> 35:48.947
Okay. I'm gonna step in now,

35:48.980 --> 35:51.048
being referee guy.

35:51.081 --> 35:52.384
No, let them go, Oz.

35:52.418 --> 35:54.286
Talking about it
isn't helping.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.920
We might as well
try some violence.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.958
I was being sarcastic!

36:00.992 --> 36:02.427
(groaning, screaming)

36:11.702 --> 36:12.737
Xander, kitchen!

36:12.771 --> 36:14.606
I got your back.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.922
Are these vampires?

36:30.956 --> 36:32.791
Uh, I don't think so.
Buffy, heads up!

36:35.760 --> 36:38.264
No, not vampires.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.742
(gasps)

36:50.775 --> 36:53.177
(screaming)

36:53.210 --> 36:56.414
Man, this sucker wobbles,
but he won't fall down!

36:56.447 --> 36:58.115
We got to get 'em
back outside.

36:58.148 --> 36:59.016
On three!

36:59.050 --> 37:00.018
One...

37:00.050 --> 37:01.353
Two... three!

37:01.387 --> 37:03.054
(groaning)

37:05.990 --> 37:08.126
Okay. We're gonna have
to barricade this door.

37:08.159 --> 37:10.528
We need some help
out here!
I got it.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.563
Go help Buffy.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.065
Grab that table!

37:17.235 --> 37:18.637
(screams)

37:18.670 --> 37:20.672
Upstairs!

37:23.909 --> 37:26.043
Oh, wait!

37:26.077 --> 37:27.045
Oh, God.

37:27.077 --> 37:28.045
Careful.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.614
(groans)

37:29.648 --> 37:31.215
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

37:31.248 --> 37:32.617
(muttering)

37:32.650 --> 37:34.519
Okay.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.159
Oz!

37:41.192 --> 37:42.628
Go! Go!

37:46.197 --> 37:47.365
Okay.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.068
She's...

37:51.101 --> 37:52.938
Oh, God. Pat.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.373
She's dead!

38:00.612 --> 38:01.813
(groaning)

38:01.847 --> 38:03.181
What do we do
if they get in?

38:03.213 --> 38:04.550
I kind of think
we die.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.626
CORDELIA:
I don't hear anything.

38:14.659 --> 38:17.262
Should we check?

38:17.295 --> 38:18.864
OZ: (sighs)
Let's go for it.

38:25.070 --> 38:27.204
(clattering)

38:27.237 --> 38:28.340
Here.

38:28.373 --> 38:30.141
Thanks.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.945
(gasps)

38:33.978 --> 38:35.681
Cordelia, it's me. It's me.

38:35.713 --> 38:37.849
How do we know it's really you
and not zombie Giles?

38:37.882 --> 38:39.451
Cordelia, do stop
being tiresome.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.686
It's him.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.623
I think the dead man's party's
moved upstairs.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.557
That makes sense.

38:46.592 --> 38:49.126
It's the mask in Joyce's bedroom
they're after.

38:49.159 --> 38:50.596
Mask?

38:52.097 --> 38:56.134
The mask holds the power
of a zombie demon,

38:56.166 --> 39:00.304
called Ovu Mobani-- Evil Eye.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.873
I don't think we
can get past them.

39:02.907 --> 39:04.675
Well, what happens
if they get the mask?

39:04.710 --> 39:06.411
If one of them
puts it on,

39:06.445 --> 39:08.547
they become
the demon incarnate.

39:08.579 --> 39:10.148
Worse than a zombie.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.583
Yes, worse.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.353
(groaning)

39:26.297 --> 39:27.432
Oh, God!

39:27.465 --> 39:29.701
We thought you were...

39:37.775 --> 39:39.710
(screaming)

39:39.744 --> 39:40.945
Generally speaking,

39:40.978 --> 39:43.782
when scary things get scared,
not good.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.918
I live, you die.

39:57.463 --> 40:00.164
Willow, don't look!

40:15.447 --> 40:16.981
Out back!

40:17.014 --> 40:18.349
(growling)

40:19.451 --> 40:21.753
Not looking. Not looking.

40:21.786 --> 40:24.623
(groaning)

40:32.429 --> 40:34.132
Tell Buffy Mobani's power

40:34.164 --> 40:35.166
lies in his eyes.

40:35.199 --> 40:36.534
(groaning)

40:38.135 --> 40:40.338
She has to go
for the eyes to defeat him!

40:45.643 --> 40:47.177
Buffy!

40:50.047 --> 40:51.349
Hey, Pat.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.518
(groaning)

40:54.385 --> 40:56.186
Made you look.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.400
Never mind.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.307
Honey!

41:17.342 --> 41:18.710
Oh!

41:18.744 --> 41:20.344
Are you all right?

41:20.378 --> 41:22.380
Yeah.

41:22.413 --> 41:24.449
So...

41:24.481 --> 41:27.052
is this a typical day
at the office?

41:27.085 --> 41:28.318
No.

41:28.353 --> 41:29.855
This was nothing.

41:37.027 --> 41:38.228
Nice moves.

41:39.496 --> 41:40.699
BUFFY:
You, too.

41:53.043 --> 41:54.445
(knocking)

41:57.047 --> 41:59.016
Do we have an appointment?

41:59.050 --> 42:00.418
I'd like to have
a word with you.

42:00.451 --> 42:02.152
If that word is Buffy,

42:02.186 --> 42:05.523
then I have two words for you--
good and riddance.

42:05.556 --> 42:07.257
Now, if you don't mind,

42:07.291 --> 42:09.927
I have an appointment
with the mayor.

42:09.960 --> 42:12.063
You can't keep her
out of this school.

42:12.097 --> 42:14.431
I think you'll find I can.

42:14.465 --> 42:16.333
You had no grounds
for expelling her.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.536
I have grounds,
I have precedent,

42:18.570 --> 42:20.271
and a tingly kind of feeling.

42:20.304 --> 42:22.273
Buffy Summers is a minor

42:22.306 --> 42:24.876
and is entitled
to a public education.

42:24.909 --> 42:26.612
Your personal dislike
of the girl

42:26.644 --> 42:28.512
does not legally entitle you...

42:28.545 --> 42:31.516
Why don't you take it up
with the City Council?

42:31.548 --> 42:34.284
I thought I'd start with
the State Supreme Court.

42:36.121 --> 42:38.389
You're powerful
in local circles,

42:38.422 --> 42:41.927
but I believe I can make life
very difficult for you,

42:41.960 --> 42:43.427
professionally speaking.

42:43.460 --> 42:45.697
And Buffy will be allowed
back in.

42:45.731 --> 42:47.465
Sorry.

42:47.498 --> 42:49.735
I'm not convinced.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.806
Would you like me
to convince you?

43:01.079 --> 43:02.981
I mean, I'm not
a full-fledged witch.

43:03.014 --> 43:04.983
That takes years.

43:05.016 --> 43:08.119
I just did a couple
of Pagan blessings

43:08.152 --> 43:10.255
and teeny glamour
to hide a zit.

43:10.288 --> 43:11.657
It doesn't scare you?

43:11.690 --> 43:13.257
It has.

43:13.291 --> 43:16.327
I tried to communicate
with the spirit world,

43:16.360 --> 43:18.396
and I so wasn't
ready for that.

43:18.429 --> 43:21.666
It's like being
pulled apart inside.

43:21.699 --> 43:24.168
Plus I blew the power
for our whole block.

43:24.202 --> 43:26.070
Big scare.

43:26.103 --> 43:28.438
I wish I could've
been there with you.

43:28.472 --> 43:29.574
Me, too.

43:29.606 --> 43:31.242
I really freaked out.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.811
I am sorry.

43:32.844 --> 43:35.813
It's okay. I understand
you having to bail,

43:35.847 --> 43:37.748
and I can forgive that.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.951
I have to make allowances

43:39.985 --> 43:41.820
for what you're going through

43:41.853 --> 43:44.121
and be a grown-up about it.

43:44.155 --> 43:46.190
You're really enjoying

43:46.224 --> 43:48.358
this whole moral superiority
thing, aren't you?

43:48.393 --> 43:49.827
It's like a drug.

43:49.860 --> 43:51.195
Fine. Okay.

43:51.228 --> 43:53.965
I'm the bad.
I can take my lumps...

43:53.998 --> 43:55.666
For a while.

43:55.701 --> 43:58.168
All right. I'll stop
giving you a hard time...

43:58.202 --> 44:00.005
Runaway.

44:00.038 --> 44:01.371
Wil!

44:01.405 --> 44:03.507
I'm sorry... quitter.

44:04.876 --> 44:05.844
Whiner.

44:05.876 --> 44:07.344
Bailer.

44:07.378 --> 44:08.445
Harpy.

44:08.478 --> 44:09.614
Delinquent.

44:09.646 --> 44:11.181
Tramp.

44:11.215 --> 44:12.217
WILLOW: Bad seed.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.784
BUFFY: Witch.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.152
WILLOW: Freak.

44:47.853 --> 44:50.288
Grr. Argh.
