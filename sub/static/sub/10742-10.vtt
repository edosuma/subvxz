Morning, Jeannie.

01:15.642 --> 01:18.109
           Good morning, master.
                I am ready.

01:18.144 --> 01:19.477
   Oh, yes?
Ready for what?

01:20.681 --> 01:23.147

        that goes like the wind.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.316
Well, it's not a cart.

01:24.351 --> 01:25.684
It's a car. A car.
  And I'm afraid

01:25.719 --> 01:27.252
 I can't take you
out today, Jeannie.

01:27.287 --> 01:29.020
I'm right in the middle
   of an experiment.

  what this experiment is about.

Do you really want to know?
                        Mm.

                  to tell me.

01:42.302 --> 01:45.536
I'm working on a small,
portable desalinization unit.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.072
  And if it works,
 it's going to solve

01:47.107 --> 01:49.241

   problems in-- In--

01:49.276 --> 01:50.375

01:52.045 --> 01:53.745

01:55.015 --> 01:57.015
          When we go riding,
      may I sit behind the wheel

01:57.050 --> 01:58.483
      that moves the magic cart?

01:58.518 --> 02:00.318
   With this unit,
  if you're stranded

02:00.354 --> 02:02.520
in the middle of the ocean,
    on an island, say--

02:02.555 --> 02:04.022
   Well, like we were.
    You can make all

02:04.057 --> 02:06.057
the fresh water you need
right out of the ocean.

02:08.027 --> 02:11.229
       Let us get stranded again
         so we can try it out.

02:11.264 --> 02:13.131
There has to be a way
    to lick this.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.634
    Oh, nothing could be easier.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.703

            in the magic cart,

02:17.738 --> 02:19.605

                   very fast.

    What did you say?

02:21.441 --> 02:23.609

that your great-grandfather

02:37.658 --> 02:39.324

out of seawater?

02:39.359 --> 02:41.226
                   Yes.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.862
      At least he used to know
    how to do it 2000 years ago.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.965

               a Garden of Eden,

   while that of his neighbors
 all around was like baked clay.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.422
        I've been thinking
 about our meeting this morning,

18:12.525 --> 18:13.490
        What have you got there?

18:13.526 --> 18:15.158
           Well,
this is drinking water, sir.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.494
    Don't you have running water
       in your home, captain?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.062
      Well, of course.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.964
  This isn't ordinary water.
       It's seawater.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.038
      what would your answer be?

18:28.073 --> 18:30.073
     I'm conducting
a little experiment, sir.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.242
       Oh, another one, captain?

18:31.277 --> 18:33.143

           the one with the car?

18:33.179 --> 18:35.679
   Yes, sir, I finished that.
I won't have to test that again.

          Are you sure that cask

18:39.418 --> 18:41.251
             doesn't contain
        something else, captain?

18:41.287 --> 18:43.019
I-I don't understand
what you mean, sir.

22:25.711 --> 22:27.578
It is called the geloom seed.

22:27.613 --> 22:31.248
