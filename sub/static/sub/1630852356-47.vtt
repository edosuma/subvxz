08:53.271 --> 08:54.272
Ahh! The face!

08:54.316 --> 08:56.579
Oh, the boy looks miserable.

08:56.623 --> 08:59.887
Cricket trusted me
to be a good chaperone,
and I messed it up big time.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.193
Dang it, Bill, ya gotta
do something to fix this!

09:03.630 --> 09:05.327
Their final prank.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.329
Wait, sir!
Don't pull that lever!

09:07.372 --> 09:09.374
You'll ruin your son's date!

09:09.418 --> 09:11.028
It's not a date.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.730
Uh, what's happening?

09:16.773 --> 09:17.948
Ohh, no!

09:17.992 --> 09:20.560
[screaming]

09:20.603 --> 09:21.952
Uhh... Ahh!

09:21.996 --> 09:25.173
Oh! Hey-ah! Yeah! Ooh!

09:25.216 --> 09:28.176
- [elevator dings]
- [screaming]

09:28.219 --> 09:30.700
Next time, Terry...
I pick the restaurant.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.180
- Oof!
- Oof!

09:32.223 --> 09:34.835
- Oof! [laughs]
- Whoa! [laughs]

09:34.878 --> 09:38.316
- Dad!
- Hey, kids!

09:38.360 --> 09:40.928
Before I black out from all
the blood rushing to my head,

09:40.971 --> 09:43.844
I just want to say... [groans]

09:43.887 --> 09:46.847
Son, I'm sorry for putting so
much pressure on you tonight.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.500
Thanks, Dad.
I needed to hear that.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.764
I'm just a kid right now,
and I wanna have fun!

09:50.807 --> 09:53.070
Not worry
about date stuff. Hup.

09:53.114 --> 09:56.204
Loud and clear. [groans] Agh!

09:56.247 --> 10:00.295
And Gabriella, I'm sorry
for making this whole night
really weird!

10:00.338 --> 10:02.123
Nah, it's cool.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.081
[screaming]

10:10.174 --> 10:12.307
- Ah... Whoa!
- Whoa, he-heh.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.265
- Aww! Oof!
- Aww! Oof!

10:14.309 --> 10:16.224
[Gabriella] <i>Uh, help, please!</i>

10:16.267 --> 10:17.965
- [gasps] Gabriella!
- [gasps] Gabriella!

10:21.577 --> 10:25.059
That was not only the greatest
thing I have ever experienced,

10:25.102 --> 10:27.235
you are the best chaperone ever!

10:27.278 --> 10:29.193
And if things always
gonna get this crazy,

10:29.237 --> 10:31.326
I'm gonna need you to chaperone
for us all the time!

10:31.369 --> 10:34.285
[chuckles] Well, Cricket,
what do you think?

10:34.329 --> 10:36.505
Maybe you just drop us off
and pick us up.

10:36.548 --> 10:37.941
It's a date.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.682
Now looks like we have
just enough time

10:39.726 --> 10:43.033
to see a certain Rat win
the heart of a nation.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.687
- Yay!
- Yay!

10:44.731 --> 10:47.298
Just where do you
think you're going?

10:47.342 --> 10:50.301
Oh. Right. We destroyed
another restaurant.

10:53.348 --> 10:56.177
- Huh?
- Ha-ha, oh that's
how it's gonna be, eh?

10:56.220 --> 10:58.353
- Take that!
- [they all laugh]

10:58.396 --> 11:01.748
- Oh! They'll be tellin'
this story at your wedding!
- [Cricket] What?
