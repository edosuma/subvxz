<i> They're saying the roads</i>

00:08.901 --> 00:10.067
<i> aren't safe with the ice.</i>

00:10.160 --> 00:11.585
<i> I don't think</i>
<i> I'll be home for a while.</i>

00:11.661 --> 00:13.920
Then is it okay
if I go out and play?

00:14.073 --> 00:15.347
I promise I'll be careful.

00:15.499 --> 00:18.183
MOM:
<i> Abe, you know the cold</i>
<i> is bad for your asthma.</i>

00:18.335 --> 00:20.927
I'll bring my inhaler.
It's no different than hockey.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.081
MOM:<i> The difference is</i>
<i> I'm at the rink during hockey.</i>

00:24.083 --> 00:26.583
But, Mom, they're having fun.

00:26.602 --> 00:28.343
MOM:
<i> I know,</i> <i> and I'm so sorry.</i>

00:28.362 --> 00:31.104

<i> you can eat junk food</i>

Okay.

00:36.111 --> 00:39.163
I love you too, Mom.

03:12.918 --> 03:14.918

you already have company.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.604
Found him in the snow,
he's hypothermic.

03:17.756 --> 03:19.072
Owen, are you bleeding?

03:19.775 --> 03:21.200
No, that's not my blood.

03:23.929 --> 03:25.412
Is he gonna be okay?

03:27.616 --> 03:29.291
The pressure's not working.

03:33.622 --> 03:35.214
Oh. Oh, boy. All right.

03:35.290 --> 03:37.699
It's not a bullet wound,
but looks like he was stabbed,

03:37.718 --> 03:39.125
hit a brachial artery.

a clean pair of socks

I'm gonna have to
cauterize this wound.

03:47.286 --> 03:49.578
Come back and try to get him
to open up his mouth,

see if he'll bite down
on the sock.

Do you have a landline

Cap, we gotta get in there
before USAR boys

05:13.038 --> 05:14.146
put a red tag

05:14.297 --> 05:15.722
If they do,
there's a good reason for it.

05:15.799 --> 05:18.708
There has to be 20,000 pounds
of ice on that structure.

05:18.727 --> 05:20.819
Maybe we can get you
some ladders and chainsaws,

05:20.896 --> 05:22.045
start removing
the bigger pieces.

05:22.064 --> 05:23.488
Yeah. Well, with

05:23.490 --> 05:24.823

05:30.998 --> 05:32.405
Judd, you saw what happened

05:32.482 --> 05:33.723
the last time we went in.

05:33.742 --> 05:36.150
We don't even know
Paul or that girl's status.

05:36.228 --> 05:38.152
Much less where
they are in the pile.

05:38.230 --> 05:40.422
Okay, well, hey,
Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.568
Hey, look, if we lose
their little girl,

05:44.586 --> 05:46.178
I wanna be able
to look 'em in the eye

05:46.329 --> 05:49.089
and say to 'em we did
everything we could to save her.

05:49.091 --> 05:50.849
And right now,
we cannot do that.

05:50.926 --> 05:53.852
However, if we go in there
and we're quick
and we tread lightly,

05:53.929 --> 05:55.020
we can take a look around

05:55.097 --> 05:57.481
before USAR shuts
this whole scene down.

06:00.027 --> 06:03.028
Okay, but if they make the call
I want your word,

06:03.179 --> 06:05.179
you get your butts
out of there right away.

leave the scene, Captain?

06:12.598 --> 06:13.613
Good luck.

06:13.690 --> 06:16.291
All right, 129,
pack up your crap!

06:19.380 --> 06:21.880
Chavez.
You got a wax build-up?

06:22.031 --> 06:24.007
Your house is on the move.

06:25.794 --> 06:28.428
129 may be my house,
but Paul's my family.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.947
I have to help rescue him, sir.

06:30.966 --> 06:32.724
You're a good kid, Chavez.

06:32.876 --> 06:35.285
Not a bright kid,
but a good one.

06:35.303 --> 06:37.729
All right if he joins
your command, Captain?

06:37.806 --> 06:38.972
We'd be glad to have him.

06:39.124 --> 06:42.067
The 126 boys really are
something, aren't they?

06:42.144 --> 06:43.460
CAPTAIN ANDREWS:
It's not just the boys.

06:43.462 --> 06:46.196
All right, 122,
let's get in there.

06:53.563 --> 06:56.063
Okay, try to stay
calm for me, ma'am.
What's your name?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.732
-It's Carol.
-GRACE:<i> Okay, Carol.</i>

06:57.809 --> 06:58.825
<i> My name is Grace.</i>

06:58.902 --> 07:00.477

07:02.981 --> 07:04.147
I mean, yes, I'm here,

07:04.166 --> 07:06.499
but only because
I needed a landline.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.910
I tried to call
from my cell, but--

07:08.929 --> 07:10.929
Yeah, the towers are out
across the city.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.338
Can you tell me
where the boy is?

07:12.491 --> 07:14.841
CAROL:<i> A block away,</i>
<i> in the pond off Mill Road.</i>

07:14.918 --> 07:15.917
GRACE:
Okay, I do see the pond.

07:15.994 --> 07:17.102
You said the boy's
under the ice?

07:17.253 --> 07:19.086
Do you know how long
he's been under there?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.088
CAROL:<i> No, my husband</i>
<i> saw him open his eyes,</i>

07:21.166 --> 07:23.424
but that was at least
five minutes ago.

07:23.444 --> 07:26.945
We tried to break the ice,
but it's too thick.

07:27.096 --> 07:28.280
You have to send somebody.

07:28.356 --> 07:29.430
(sighs) Okay.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.450
Um, unfortunately,
because of the weather,

07:31.601 --> 07:33.100
there are no available
fire trucks

07:33.120 --> 07:34.769
within ten miles of that pond.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.513
Well, then he's gonna die!

07:36.531 --> 07:37.605
(beeps)

07:37.699 --> 07:40.183
But I do see one other unit
in the area.

07:40.185 --> 07:43.128
(siren wailing)

07:47.000 --> 07:49.542
Here they come! Over here!

07:49.636 --> 07:51.303
Well, there's the ambulance,

07:51.530 --> 07:53.221
but where are the fire trucks?

07:54.641 --> 07:56.391
(siren wailing)

07:57.536 --> 07:58.535
That must be them.

07:58.553 --> 08:00.887
TOMMY: Okay, TK,
park the rig right here.

08:01.039 --> 08:04.107
NANCY:
Uh, we're sliding.
We're sliding!

08:05.319 --> 08:06.710
Or not.

08:06.712 --> 08:09.045
All right, TK, get
the ECMO machine ready to go,

08:09.064 --> 08:10.304
and start the warming fluids.

08:10.382 --> 08:11.323
Nancy, help me with the gurney.

08:11.399 --> 08:12.882
And careful where you step.

08:12.884 --> 08:14.642
No one needs a broken tailbone.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.685
-TK: Copy.
-NANCY: Copy.

08:15.687 --> 08:17.070
(wind whistling)

08:17.164 --> 08:20.499
He's out there. I put my hat
on the ice over where he is

08:20.575 --> 08:22.058
so the firefighters can find him

08:22.077 --> 08:24.077
when they get here.
Are they close?

08:24.229 --> 08:26.913
They're all spoken for
because of the Snowmageddon.

08:27.065 --> 08:29.082
Good news is, I was
a firefighter in New York,

08:29.234 --> 08:30.750
so this is not
my first ice rescue.

08:30.827 --> 08:34.346
Okay, but-but don't you need
special gear for that?

08:36.850 --> 08:39.017
We'll just have to improvise.

08:40.762 --> 08:44.147
(wind whistling)

08:49.755 --> 08:50.678
(door opens)

08:50.756 --> 08:52.272
Here, let me grab that.

08:52.424 --> 08:54.107
Alright, what you got in here?

08:54.259 --> 08:56.276
-Oh, my God, look at that relic.
-(Sadie chuckles)

08:56.428 --> 08:58.036
When was
the last time you used it?

08:58.187 --> 09:00.187
Me? Never. No.

09:00.265 --> 09:01.856
That belongs to my ex.

09:01.933 --> 09:04.209
Some guys
collect baseball cards,

09:04.360 --> 09:06.286
others rebuild hot rods,

09:06.362 --> 09:08.955
Clyde was into ham radio.

09:09.032 --> 09:11.049
Sorry, I don't have
the instructions.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.777
Oh, I'm sure
we can figure it out.

09:13.795 --> 09:14.944
Assuming that it works.

09:14.946 --> 09:17.038
No, it-it does. Or it did.

09:17.115 --> 09:19.558
Clyde's finest hour
was raising some kook

09:19.709 --> 09:21.634
in Galveston on that thing.

10:15.098 --> 10:17.690
DISPATCH:
<i> Emergency response is jammed</i>
<i> with the storm, Captain.</i>

10:17.784 --> 10:19.451
<i> We'll get someone up there</i>
<i> as soon as we can.</i>

10:19.678 --> 10:21.527
That's code for
don't hold your breath.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.997
Roger that,
I'll keep the channel open.

10:24.866 --> 10:27.142
So he's a firefighter.

10:27.144 --> 10:30.277
Was. I'm sorry, it's not
as exciting as ax murder.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.354
Hmm.

10:31.447 --> 10:34.207
And yet still pretty exciting.

10:34.359 --> 10:35.258
Mm...

10:35.861 --> 10:38.720
(wind whistling)

10:40.807 --> 10:43.216
All right,
we're gonna slide in,
everybody be smooth.

10:43.368 --> 10:46.068
Everybody be very safe
and do not compromise
this structure.

10:46.070 --> 10:47.103
Let's go.

10:49.391 --> 10:50.398
MATEO: Paul!

10:52.560 --> 10:54.110
Paul, you hear me?

10:54.637 --> 10:55.654
Paul!

10:56.548 --> 10:57.714
Paul!

10:57.732 --> 10:59.157
MAN: I see an opening.

11:05.724 --> 11:06.998
Paul!

11:08.001 --> 11:10.210
Paul! Paul!

11:10.987 --> 11:11.911
Paul, you hear me?

11:12.005 --> 11:13.338
-JUDD: You see him?
-MATEO: Nah, man.

11:13.489 --> 11:15.006
-It's just ice.
-Damn it.

11:15.233 --> 11:16.733
I would have thought
that we would have got
a thermal signature

11:16.735 --> 11:17.825
of either him or the kid by now.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.068
MATEO: Unless we're going
the wrong way.

11:19.070 --> 11:20.494
-What is it?
-I mean, how do we even know

11:20.572 --> 11:21.754
we're going
in the right direction?

11:21.831 --> 11:23.423
We don't.
Actually, you know what?

11:23.575 --> 11:25.517
I know somebody's who's gonna
give us a helping hand.

11:25.668 --> 11:27.168
Good, 'cause this is a mess.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.396
(wind whistling)

11:32.767 --> 11:34.234
(Paul grunts)

11:39.424 --> 11:40.365
(pants)

11:44.687 --> 11:46.746
(panting)

11:50.101 --> 11:53.436
Strickland to IC.
I'm in a void space.

11:53.455 --> 11:55.130
Anybody copy?

11:57.867 --> 11:59.342
-Hello?
-(static over radio)

12:00.628 --> 12:02.011
(groans)

12:07.894 --> 12:09.477
(thudding in distance)

12:14.234 --> 12:16.109
Lindsey? Oh, my God.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.403
(grunting)

12:19.147 --> 12:21.197
Lindsey? Hey. Hey.

12:24.894 --> 12:26.727
Lindsey. Hey.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.204
Hey. Hey, hey.

12:30.492 --> 12:32.917
-What happened?
-The roof collapsed.

12:32.994 --> 12:34.660
Again. How you feelin'?

12:34.813 --> 12:36.087
Does anything hurt?

12:36.164 --> 12:37.422
I-I don't think so.

12:37.573 --> 12:40.241
Okay, good. I'm Paul.
I'm a firefighter.

12:40.318 --> 12:42.260
Try to follow
my finger with your eyes.

12:43.505 --> 12:44.779
Good, good.

12:44.856 --> 12:46.580
Do you know where you are?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.508
Providence. Tuesday.

12:48.584 --> 12:49.993
Joe Biden.

12:50.086 --> 12:51.494
(chuckles) You played
this game before, huh?

12:51.513 --> 12:53.830
Hey, uh, how did you
know my name?

12:53.848 --> 12:55.164
You called me Lindsey.

12:55.183 --> 12:57.000
Yeah, lady of the hour.

12:57.002 --> 12:59.260
The reason
me and my team came in.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.429
Really? I can't believe it.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.115
Heh, come on.

13:04.192 --> 13:06.451
A 16-year-old
volunteering in a shelter?

13:06.602 --> 13:08.936
The world can't afford
to lose kids like you.

13:09.014 --> 13:11.122
No, I...
I mean, I can't believe

13:11.274 --> 13:12.791
anyone noticed
I was missing.

13:12.867 --> 13:14.959
Oh, yeah, we noticed.

13:15.036 --> 13:18.112
Now we just need
my team to come get us out.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.965
122. Strickland here.

13:21.042 --> 13:22.342
I got Lindsey.

13:24.379 --> 13:25.637
Anybody copy?

13:29.292 --> 13:31.701
I think my radio
got busted in the collapse.

13:31.719 --> 13:33.228
Cover your ears.

13:34.706 --> 13:37.398
(yelling): Mateo? Judd?

13:38.301 --> 13:40.068
Can anybody hear me?

13:42.881 --> 13:45.949
Can I see it... your radio?

13:47.494 --> 13:48.568
Sure.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.162
Pretty sure it's a brick though.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.001
LINDSEY: No.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.462
I can fix this.

14:05.161 --> 14:07.011
TOMMY:
TK, are you sure about this?

14:07.238 --> 14:09.330
Don't worry, Cap.
I did a bunch of these

14:09.407 --> 14:10.923
back in the day in Central Park.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.575
This is no different.

14:12.594 --> 14:14.577
You're using a bedsheet
as a life ring

14:14.596 --> 14:16.746
and a laryngoscope
as an ice pick.

14:16.764 --> 14:19.357
-It's different!
-Valid point.

14:21.677 --> 14:23.361
(ice cracking)

14:29.369 --> 14:30.702
I see the kid!

14:30.929 --> 14:33.705
There's no hole, I'm gonna
have to break through the ice!

14:35.767 --> 14:37.283
(grunting)

14:37.435 --> 14:38.334
Come on.

14:42.790 --> 14:44.957
How's it goin'?

14:45.110 --> 14:48.094
Well, it turns out
it's easier with a pickax.

14:52.634 --> 14:54.309
(grunting)

14:55.637 --> 14:57.186
I'm through.

15:01.643 --> 15:03.151
(groans)

15:08.724 --> 15:10.199
I've got him.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.327
(soft laugh)

15:15.731 --> 15:17.457
(ice cracking)

15:26.626 --> 15:28.593
-TOMMY: TK!
-NANCY: TK?

15:33.433 --> 15:36.017
Hey! Don't let go!
Pull him up!

15:40.348 --> 15:42.190
(grunting)

15:45.170 --> 15:47.019
TK: Don't! Stay there!

15:47.096 --> 15:48.279
Pull us towards you!

15:49.282 --> 15:51.240
(grunting)

15:59.275 --> 16:01.184
No pulse, no respiration, Cap.

16:01.202 --> 16:02.535
CAROL:
Does that mean he's dead?

16:02.629 --> 16:05.279
No, ma'am. You're not dead
until you're warm and dead.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.448
We're gonna do
some rapid rewarming,

16:07.467 --> 16:09.616
and hopefully
we'll be able to get him back.

16:09.694 --> 16:11.302
Let's load him into the--

16:12.197 --> 16:13.429
Where's the rig?

16:15.366 --> 16:17.291
CAROL:
It slid down the embankment.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.552
NANCY:
Well, that is unfortunate.

16:19.628 --> 16:20.645
All right, change in plan.

16:20.872 --> 16:21.980
TK, radio dispatch,

16:22.131 --> 16:23.706
ask for a back-up rig
and a tow truck.

16:23.725 --> 16:25.817
-Copy, Cap.
-Nancy, I need you
to climb in there

16:25.968 --> 16:27.318
and get the portable
ECMO machine.

16:27.395 --> 16:28.987
-NANCY: Copy that!
-You got it.

16:29.138 --> 16:30.546
-And you, ma'am.
-Yes.

16:30.548 --> 16:33.116
Please tell me
your heater works.

16:33.901 --> 16:36.828
(indistinct radio chatter)

16:36.979 --> 16:39.572
-MATEO: Paul!
-JUDD: Paul!

16:39.724 --> 16:42.500
Grace, we're trying to get
to where we last saw Paul
at the south wall,

16:42.577 --> 16:44.744
but we're slammed up
against a bunch of debris

16:44.896 --> 16:46.412
about 30 yards
from the Alpha entrance.

16:46.489 --> 16:48.748
Okay, I'm looking at
the building schematics now.

16:48.824 --> 16:51.300
I'm guessing you're somewhere
on the basketball court?

16:52.086 --> 16:53.402
Yeah, I see a hoop.

16:53.404 --> 16:54.495
MATEO:
Damn. Your lady's good.

16:54.572 --> 16:55.905
JUDD:
Why do you think I called her?

16:55.923 --> 16:57.498
All right, Gracie,
how do you reckon we proceed

16:57.517 --> 16:58.499
<i> to find Paul?</i>

16:58.518 --> 16:59.350
Uh, let's see.

16:59.427 --> 17:00.593
Looks like your best bet is to

17:00.745 --> 17:02.669
double back through
the Alpha Bravo wall.

17:02.747 --> 17:04.188
<i> There's a lot of</i>
<i> load-bearing beams.</i>

17:04.265 --> 17:05.915
There's a good chance
of air pockets

17:05.917 --> 17:06.932
for your team
to make it through.

17:07.085 --> 17:08.860
Good. Good, good.
Thank you, dispatch.

17:08.936 --> 17:11.178
PAUL (over radio):
<i> Strickland to IC,</i>
<i> anybody copy?</i>

17:11.197 --> 17:13.422
-Hey, Paul, Paul, Paul!
-Paul, brother, is that you?

17:13.424 --> 17:14.757
PAUL (over radio):
<i> Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i> can you guys hear me?</i>

17:14.776 --> 17:15.925
MATEO (over radio):
<i> Yeah, we read you!</i>

17:15.943 --> 17:17.351
JUDD (over radio):
<i> Babe, you hear that?</i>

17:17.370 --> 17:18.202
I do hear that.

17:18.279 --> 17:19.537
Well, brother, where you at?

17:19.614 --> 17:21.372
Some sort of locker room.

17:21.599 --> 17:24.876
GRACE: Judd, the locker room,
looks like it's 25 yards
to your northeast.

17:25.027 --> 17:28.454
So at the junction
of the Bravo Charlie wall.

17:28.606 --> 17:29.863
Thank you, dispatch.
Appreciate the assist.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.607
GRACE:
<i> Anytime, Firefighter Ryder.</i>

17:31.609 --> 17:33.051
MATEO:
Hang in there, bro,
we're coming for ya.

17:33.278 --> 17:36.262
PAUL (over radio):
<i> Hey, you do you.</i>
<i> We'll be right here.</i>

17:37.223 --> 17:39.057
Lindsey, you saved the day!

17:39.208 --> 17:42.301
-What are you talking about?
-You fixed the radio,
that was clutch.

17:42.453 --> 17:44.562
I just fixed
a loose ribbon cable.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.806
Nothing clutch about it.

17:46.958 --> 17:47.973
No, no, because of you, we--

17:48.050 --> 17:50.276
Because of me,
we're trapped here.

17:51.629 --> 17:53.905
I should have gotten out
with everyone else.

17:55.133 --> 17:57.366
But when the roof
started coming down...

17:58.894 --> 18:00.161
I froze.

18:01.489 --> 18:02.997
It's all my fault.

18:05.993 --> 18:07.919
I think you're being
a little hard on yourself.

18:07.995 --> 18:09.829
No.

18:09.981 --> 18:12.331
I always choke up
under pressure.

18:12.408 --> 18:15.426
That's why I had to quit
dressage and cello.

18:16.821 --> 18:19.913
I froze because it's what I do.

18:19.933 --> 18:23.342
And now because of me,
we could literally
freeze to death.

18:23.419 --> 18:27.012
Lindsey... they're on their way.

18:27.089 --> 18:29.014
Okay? Hey, hey.

18:29.016 --> 18:31.359
-We're gonna be fine.
-(thud overhead)

18:32.928 --> 18:35.279
-What was that?
-PAUL: Stay close.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.369
(screaming)

18:43.865 --> 18:45.456
(groaning)

18:46.442 --> 18:47.774
122!

18:47.794 --> 18:50.277
PAUL:
<i> 122, the water pipes burst!</i>

18:50.296 --> 18:51.612
<i> We're getting soaked here!</i>

18:51.689 --> 18:54.190
Cap, somebody needs
to shut the water off now!

18:54.192 --> 18:56.467
-What the hell happened?
-An ice storm hit Texas

18:56.619 --> 18:58.636
and this place ain't
never been weatherproofed.

18:59.622 --> 19:00.880
Olsen! Ricardo!

19:01.032 --> 19:03.123
Heck, somebody
find that water main

19:03.201 --> 19:04.967
and get it clamped!

19:05.961 --> 19:08.354
Hang in there, Lindsey!
Hang in there!

19:09.056 --> 19:11.131
(groaning)

19:11.209 --> 19:14.543
(Paul screaming and groaning)

19:14.637 --> 19:16.028
(Lindsey screaming)

19:18.140 --> 19:19.365
I think, I think it stopped.

19:20.401 --> 19:22.309
-I think it stopped.
-I'm so cold.

19:22.387 --> 19:23.810
-I'm so cold.
-It's okay.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.479
Hey, we're gonna be okay.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.555
Hey, hey, it stopped.

19:26.557 --> 19:28.391
Hey, all right, Paul.
Hey, hey.

19:28.409 --> 19:31.151
Y'all think warm thoughts
and we're gonna be there soon.

19:31.171 --> 19:34.413
Judd, if they're
hypothermic and wet,

19:34.565 --> 19:37.049
survival window
went from hours to minutes.

19:37.993 --> 19:39.068
Yeah, I know.

19:39.086 --> 19:41.095
(wind gusting)

19:49.764 --> 19:51.189
OWEN: How's he doing?

19:51.307 --> 19:53.416
Well, still not bleeding.

19:53.434 --> 19:54.934
You branded him pretty good.

19:55.010 --> 19:56.677
And you were doubting
my cowboy cred.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.862
(Sadie chuckles)

19:58.089 --> 20:00.681
SADIE: Hey, I wonder
who put that hole in him.

20:00.758 --> 20:03.016
Yeah, I've been wondering
the same thing.

20:03.094 --> 20:05.611
Did he say anything to you
when you found him?

20:05.688 --> 20:08.855
No, he was speaking Spanish,
and he seemed pretty agitated.

20:08.933 --> 20:10.766
Guessing he's
probably here illegally.

20:10.859 --> 20:13.211
Coyotes use
these backcountry roads
for smuggling routes.

20:13.438 --> 20:15.046
Smuggling routes?
We're a long way
from the border.

20:15.215 --> 20:19.533
Well, it seems to be
quite the thing around here
in the past few years.

20:19.610 --> 20:21.552
Folks pay the cartels
to get them

20:21.704 --> 20:24.238
as far away from
the Rio Grande as possible.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.058
Then when they have them,
they jack up the price,

20:27.134 --> 20:28.951
and if they can't pay...

20:28.970 --> 20:30.377
You end up bleeding in the snow.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.712
SADIE: Mm-hmm.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.956
(Buttercup barking)

20:33.958 --> 20:35.691
(door opens)

20:40.723 --> 20:42.240
You gotta be kidding me.

20:42.467 --> 20:44.617
(wind gusting)

20:45.303 --> 20:46.661
<i> Amigo!</i>

20:48.081 --> 20:49.997
Can you hear me?

20:54.254 --> 20:56.069
How'd he even manage to get up?

20:56.089 --> 20:59.090
I don't know. Fear?
Adrenaline, maybe?

20:59.241 --> 21:01.425
If I'm not back by 6:00,
will you feed my dog?

21:01.577 --> 21:02.743
Where are you going?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.578
-I'm gonna go find him.
-Owen.

21:04.655 --> 21:06.505
He couldn't have gone far.
We can't leave him out there.

21:06.582 --> 21:07.990
If the coyotes don't kill him,
the cold will.

21:08.009 --> 21:09.341
SADIE:
Well, it'll kill you too.

21:09.494 --> 21:11.394
You can't track somebody
in a damn white-out.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.063
I've gotta try.

21:16.167 --> 21:18.985
(wind gusting)

21:31.365 --> 21:33.124
TOMMY:
Come on, kid. Come on.

21:33.159 --> 21:35.960
-TK, I need you
to prep the femoral.
-Okay.

21:36.037 --> 21:38.612
-NANCY: Are those turtles?
-CAROL: They're in shock
from the cold.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.023
We were taking them
to the aquatic warming center.

21:41.025 --> 21:43.542
Poor things
are practically frozen solid.

21:43.694 --> 21:45.285
Yeah, I can relate.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.595
Cap.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.956
Needle.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.601
(tense music)

21:53.054 --> 21:54.603
Guidewire.

21:55.964 --> 21:56.963
TOMMY: Okay.

21:57.041 --> 21:59.224
(blows)

21:59.301 --> 22:00.634
You ready to cannulate?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.653
TOMMY: Hit me.

22:02.730 --> 22:05.031
Cannulating femoral artery.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.119
Forceps.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.581
All right.

22:16.318 --> 22:18.427
-Fire it up.
-Here we go.

22:18.429 --> 22:19.628
(beeping)

22:20.414 --> 22:22.089
(TK panting)

22:23.176 --> 22:24.717
TOMMY:
Stop compressions.

22:29.073 --> 22:30.831
JOE:
What is that thing, anyway?

22:30.850 --> 22:32.016
It's called an ECMO machine.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.560
It's doing the work
of his heart and lungs for him.

22:34.670 --> 22:35.853
As it oxygenates the blood,

22:35.930 --> 22:38.022
it also warms him up
from the inside out.

22:38.099 --> 22:39.765
TK, anything?

22:39.842 --> 22:42.735
Nothing yet, Cap.
(panting)

22:43.363 --> 22:44.612
Come on, kid.

22:45.347 --> 22:46.755
Come on!

22:46.757 --> 22:48.157
He's so young.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.184
(voice breaking):
He's too young.

22:51.262 --> 22:54.113
(steady beeping)

22:54.189 --> 22:55.998
Oh, come on.

22:56.617 --> 22:57.375
(beeps)

22:57.768 --> 22:59.043
-Hey, I got a pulse!
-(monitor beeps)

22:59.161 --> 23:01.045
-And another one!
-NANCY: That's it, let's go!

23:01.196 --> 23:02.213
TK: Come on, buddy.

23:02.364 --> 23:03.547
-You got this.
-NANCY: Come on.

23:03.624 --> 23:04.607
Come on, buddy.

23:04.609 --> 23:06.008
Come on. Keep it comin'.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.961
TK: Come on.

23:09.037 --> 23:10.262
Ooh!

23:12.558 --> 23:13.782
(coughs)

23:13.801 --> 23:15.618
TOMMY:
It's all right, you're okay.

23:15.636 --> 23:17.228
-You're gonna be okay.
-JOE: Oh, my God.

23:17.379 --> 23:19.121
Wow!

23:19.123 --> 23:22.716
Where can I get me one of those
ECMOs for my turtles?

23:22.735 --> 23:26.070
They're online.
They retail for about 100K.

23:26.147 --> 23:27.463
-Oh. (laughs)
-Yeah.

23:27.465 --> 23:30.116
-(monitor beeping)
-(Carol sighs)

23:32.578 --> 23:33.661
(blows)

23:39.493 --> 23:41.644
-Right behind you guys.
-TOMMY: Thanks for coming.

23:41.662 --> 23:43.421
He's severely hypothermic.

23:43.497 --> 23:44.480
He was cyanotic,

23:44.498 --> 23:46.315
but he's returning
to normal sinus.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.317
We didn't get a TBI
on him, though.

23:48.335 --> 23:49.485
We'll take care of it.

23:49.503 --> 23:51.411
Wow, you guys
have your own ECMO.

23:51.489 --> 23:52.763
I've never seen
one in the field.

23:52.915 --> 23:54.056
Score one
for the private sector.

23:54.842 --> 23:57.309
-(chuckles)
-Got him?

23:59.664 --> 24:01.105
Mom...

24:01.182 --> 24:02.514
I-I need to call my mom.

24:02.667 --> 24:05.517
TOMMY:
You're okay. You just
keep taking deep breaths

24:05.594 --> 24:07.336
and we'll call her
from the hospital.

24:07.354 --> 24:08.428
PARAMEDIC: For sure.

24:08.522 --> 24:10.281
You want us to radio
a tow truck for you?

24:10.432 --> 24:12.158
TOMMY: Already on its way.

24:14.178 --> 24:15.578
Where's TK?

24:20.685 --> 24:23.127
(tense music)

24:28.392 --> 24:29.675
(groans)

24:32.697 --> 24:34.621
Hey! All right.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.265
Oh, hey! Oh!

24:37.125 --> 24:38.934
What is it? What'd you find?

24:39.704 --> 24:41.061
A potential life saver.

24:41.722 --> 24:42.813
That's a trash can.

24:42.965 --> 24:44.206
PAUL:
To the untrained eye, maybe.

24:44.225 --> 24:46.817
(cans clattering)

24:46.969 --> 24:49.228
Okay. This is gonna sound
all kinds of awkward,

24:49.304 --> 24:52.231
but you need to strip down.

24:52.307 --> 24:54.216
You want me to get naked?

24:54.218 --> 24:55.642
Are you crazy? I'm freezing.

24:55.736 --> 24:58.403
And wet clothes drop your
body temperature even faster.

24:58.480 --> 24:59.722
Okay? Sorry.

24:59.740 --> 25:01.740
Look, any-- anything
that's not dry comes off.

25:01.817 --> 25:04.335
Hey. And don't worry,
you're not gonna
be naked, okay?

25:04.486 --> 25:07.563
Just think of it as a...
as a wardrobe change.

25:07.565 --> 25:09.565
You want me to put
a nasty trash bag on my head?

25:09.567 --> 25:11.992
It'll keep your body heat
in your body.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.385
Okay?

25:14.922 --> 25:16.388
It'll keep you alive.

25:18.166 --> 25:20.017
Okay? Okay, good girl.

25:20.094 --> 25:21.644
Go on. Okay, go on.

25:22.429 --> 25:23.687
Just, uh...

25:23.839 --> 25:27.191
think of it as the...
world's stinkiest wet suit.

25:27.268 --> 25:28.692
LINDSEY: Not helping.

25:46.028 --> 25:47.127
Hey.

25:50.124 --> 25:51.549
Looks good on you.

25:51.700 --> 25:52.883
What about you?

25:53.035 --> 25:54.385
I'm from Chicago.

25:54.612 --> 25:55.778
We like it frosty.

25:55.780 --> 25:56.887
(siren wailing)

25:57.131 --> 25:58.889
CAPTAIN ANDREWS:
We could try
to redirect the RIC team

25:58.966 --> 26:01.225
to the Delta wall,
buttonhook there

26:01.260 --> 26:02.618
back around
to the locker room.

26:02.620 --> 26:03.786
That'll never work.

26:03.788 --> 26:05.287
'Cause that whole Delta wall's

26:05.289 --> 26:06.455
like a hedge maze from hell.

26:06.457 --> 26:08.065
What are you two guys
doin' out here?

26:08.292 --> 26:09.716
Well, we couldn't get
to it from the inside.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.402
-So what are you suggesting?
-We'll come from the outside.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.887
JUDD: We grab a couple of
few pneumatic jackhammers
off of that truck,

26:13.964 --> 26:16.240
we could punch a hole right
through that cinderblock wall

26:16.391 --> 26:17.390
and we'll be in the locker room.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.059
Maybe so,
but the vibrations alone

26:19.078 --> 26:21.078
-could pancake the building.
-It's a risk.

26:21.155 --> 26:24.489
But either way, Paul and Lindsey
won't make it out if we don't.

26:24.642 --> 26:26.325
Why do I get the feeling
that even if I say no,

26:26.477 --> 26:28.310
you two are gonna
grab those jackhammers anyway?

26:28.329 --> 26:30.904
Because you're
an excellent observer
of your fellow man, sir,

26:30.923 --> 26:32.256
that's how come.

26:34.835 --> 26:36.427
-IC to USAR.
-MAN (on radio):<i> Go.</i>

26:36.578 --> 26:38.503
I need you to bring
all of your sledges,

26:38.580 --> 26:41.006
jumbo bars,
and jackhammers
to the Delta wall.

26:41.083 --> 26:43.934
-All right.
We're on it, Caption.
Let's go make some noise.

26:44.086 --> 26:45.769
NANCY:<i> TK!</i>

26:45.846 --> 26:47.062
TK!

26:47.848 --> 26:49.440
TK?

26:49.591 --> 26:51.650
Why the hell would
he run off like that?

26:52.795 --> 26:54.236
TOMMY: Nancy!

26:56.340 --> 26:58.115
NANCY: Are those his drawers?

26:58.767 --> 27:00.117
What is happening?

27:00.194 --> 27:02.036
TOMMY: We better hurry.

27:04.698 --> 27:06.081
(shivering)

27:07.201 --> 27:08.684
TOMMY: There he is.

27:08.702 --> 27:10.369
-(muttering)
-TK.

27:10.521 --> 27:11.945
Hey, Cap. Hey, Nance.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.523
-We got some blankets
for you, babe.
-I'm good, thanks.

27:14.525 --> 27:17.192
NANCY:

frostbite on his ass.

27:17.211 --> 27:18.952
I said get away!
I said get away!

27:18.971 --> 27:20.863
-Hey. It's okay.
-Stop, stop, stop.

27:20.881 --> 27:22.714
I was burning up
and this feels better.

27:22.791 --> 27:25.033
Combativeness, it's a symptom
of severe hypothermia.

27:25.052 --> 27:26.644
NANCY:
Was just putting that together.

27:26.720 --> 27:29.371
(reciting prayers in Hebrew)

27:29.390 --> 27:32.132
-Now he's speaking in tongues?
-TOMMY: Pretty sure it's Hebrew.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.710
TK, all your blood
has left your extremities.

27:34.712 --> 27:36.654
It's around your core now,

27:36.730 --> 27:38.304
that's why you feel so hot.

27:38.382 --> 27:40.140
It's called
paradoxical undressing.

27:40.217 --> 27:41.474
It means you're near-fatal.

27:41.552 --> 27:43.218
NANCY:
And we're not about to let you

27:43.220 --> 27:44.403
freeze to death on our watch.

27:44.555 --> 27:46.146
So you can get up now
and walk out

27:46.148 --> 27:47.790
or get dragged out.

27:49.001 --> 27:52.127
-Okay. Okay.
-TOMMY: Okay!
Okay, come on.

27:53.506 --> 27:54.913
Good choice, buddy.

27:55.065 --> 27:57.082
(shivering)

27:57.234 --> 27:59.751
When were you gonna
tell us you speak Hebrew?

27:59.828 --> 28:00.844
I don't.

28:00.996 --> 28:03.588
Not since I was 10
in Hebrew school.

28:03.665 --> 28:06.058
TOMMY:
Well, looks like
some of it stuck.

28:09.747 --> 28:12.080

28:15.269 --> 28:17.152
He has no pulse, Cap.

28:19.014 --> 28:21.532
Oh, God, no heartbeat either.

28:21.683 --> 28:24.034

28:28.432 --> 28:30.207
NANCY: Okay. Come on, come on.

Hey. Nah-uh.
No, no, no, no, no.

29:07.488 --> 29:09.580
No, no sleeping.
You fall asleep,
you die, remember?

29:09.731 --> 29:12.082
-My eyes are so heavy.
-So are mine, all right?

29:12.159 --> 29:13.976
We gotta fight, right?

29:13.978 --> 29:15.169
-Okay.
-Come on.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.496
Hey? Hey?

29:17.572 --> 29:21.074
You know, I once dated
this doctor, a resident,

29:21.151 --> 29:24.486
and, uh, when she
worked 30-hour shifts,

29:24.488 --> 29:26.655
she used to put pebbles
in her shoes.

29:26.657 --> 29:29.491
Pebbles? Why?

29:29.493 --> 29:31.176
'Cause it pissed her off.

29:31.253 --> 29:34.254
Kind of hard to be sleeping
when you're pissed off, right?

29:34.273 --> 29:36.690
So tell me, Lindsey. Lindsey?

29:37.592 --> 29:39.193
What pisses you off?

29:39.853 --> 29:40.760
I-I don't know.

29:40.929 --> 29:42.446
Oh, yeah, sure you do.
Sure you do.

29:42.597 --> 29:44.506
You know, uh, the sound
a air blower makes,

29:44.599 --> 29:47.025
or, uh, when somebody puts
aioli in your sandwich

29:47.027 --> 29:48.118
without asking you first.

29:48.195 --> 29:51.279
No, I'm just...
not an angry person.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.866
So, what, you think
that makes you sound nice?

29:54.943 --> 29:57.202
Well, it makes you
sound pathetic.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.854
So why don't you get real?

29:58.856 --> 30:00.539
Get real, Lindsey! Get real!

30:00.691 --> 30:01.781
Fine!

30:02.192 --> 30:04.192
-You know what pisses me off?
-No. What pisses you off?

30:04.194 --> 30:05.527
When people
make me feel invisible.

30:05.546 --> 30:06.953
Kids at school.

30:07.031 --> 30:09.598
Volunteers at church,
my dad when he has a deadline.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.517

Hey, we're about to put some
jackhammers on the Delta wall,

30:37.336 --> 30:38.669
so it might get a little bumpy
in there.

30:38.745 --> 30:41.213
Sounds good, J.
We could use the excitement.
