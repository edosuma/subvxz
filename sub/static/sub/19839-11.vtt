00:26.920 --> 00:31.080
Anybody get the feeling these folks
don't do a lot of travellin'?

00:35.400 --> 00:38.280
It looks like it hasn't been used at all.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.840
Well, they might not even
know what the gate is.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.360
- It might be just an artefact to them.
- It's possible.

00:48.520 --> 00:53.080
You could stand here for months pressing
symbols and still not open a wormhole.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.440
(whispering)

00:55.600 --> 00:57.520
O'Neill.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.000
Sh!

01:08.240 --> 01:10.640
It was like an explosion, Orner. I heard it.

01:10.800 --> 01:14.680
- There wasn't any explosion.
- I heard something. It was a big...

01:14.840 --> 01:17.560
- A big what?
- Hello!

01:19.920 --> 01:22.240
You heard us.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.760
Where did you come from?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.680
- How did you get in here?
- Door was open.

01:31.560 --> 01:36.760
Is there anyone around here
who might be... considered... in charge?

01:37.480 --> 01:38.720
(clears throat)

01:38.880 --> 01:41.640
Me! Show me your papers.

01:42.840 --> 01:46.760
We don't really have any papers.
We're travellers. We've come to meet you.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.920
- To meet me?
- Not you!

01:50.080 --> 01:52.000
Actually, I meant your people.

01:52.160 --> 01:56.480
I'm Daniel. This is Major Carter
and Jack O'Neill and Teal'c.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.800
Who'd give you a name like Teal'c?

01:59.960 --> 02:03.280
It was given by my father.
It means strength.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.320
You remember your father?

02:08.479 --> 02:10.800
For as long as I draw breath.

02:11.880 --> 02:15.760
Then you could have not been here
at the time of the Vorlix.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.080
Vorlix. That doesn't ring a bell.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.440
It was the day that all we know
of ourselves was taken away.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.640
We can only remember
the days since the Vorlix.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.720
Before that... nothing.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.480
Don't detect anything
out of the ordinary, sir.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.760
Neither did the MALP. I think we're OK.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.600
The MALP is worthless. You I'll trust.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.160
You needn't worry, friend.

03:43.320 --> 03:47.000
Ke'ra says whatever it was that caused
the Vorlix came and went a year ago.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.840
At least a year. More.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.520
In the first days after the Vorlix,
well, there was panic and confusion.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.280
It's hard to be precise.

03:55.440 --> 03:59.360
So you all just woke up one day
and didn't know who you were.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.960
How does that work?

04:02.120 --> 04:07.440
My first memory after the Vorlix was of
running in the streets, as if for my life.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.800
She was running right there
beside me... whoever she is.

04:12.440 --> 04:15.160
Seems like some kind
of mass amnesia, sir.

04:16.279 --> 04:17.200
Hm?

04:17.360 --> 04:20.880
It happened to a friend during
the Gulf War. She was knocked out.

04:21.040 --> 04:24.800
When she came to, her memories
and identity before the crash were gone.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.160
So everybody here took a hit to the head?

04:27.560 --> 04:32.240
Well... No, sir. I... I'm not sure
what could cause amnesia on this scale.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.120
I've never before encountered
such an occurrence.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.800
- All of our elders are missing as well.
- You remember elders?

04:38.960 --> 04:41.880
No, but there are photographs
of them in every house.

04:42.040 --> 04:45.200
- The children are gone, too.
- If we ever had children.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.600
Well, we weren't grown on trees.

04:47.920 --> 04:51.600
Then why have we photographs of elders
and none of children, hm?

04:51.760 --> 04:53.400
Daft.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.600
But if you do have any information
we could use, you must see Ke'ra.

04:58.440 --> 05:01.200
That's the second time
you've mentioned that name.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.440
You don't know who Ke'ra is.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.720
She is minister of health, science,
and restructuring the Vyus government.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.840
- Busy gal.
- We're all busy.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.680
Well, we would be lost without her.
And you know it.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.600
Well... After you.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.560
You needn't flatter her
when she isn't in the room!

05:23.920 --> 05:27.320
- I'll take them. You go home.
- Well, don't expect supper!

05:27.480 --> 05:29.400
Never do.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.560
- Ke'ra, some people want to see you.
- They will have to wait, Orner.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.840
- Does that help?
- No.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.080
I can't... breathe.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.080
Those with food allergies
can't remember them.

05:59.240 --> 06:02.440
Well, it looks like she's going
into anaphylactic shock.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.520
Breathe now.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.920
- There. Better?
- Yes.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.640
- Thank you.
- Rest here a while.

06:19.440 --> 06:22.400
Orner, you were about to
introduce your friends.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.920
They are travellers, Ke'ra, from far away.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.000
I can see that.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.480
Uh... O'Neill, Carter, Daniel and Teal'c.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.760
So I'm guessing you were or are a doctor.

06:37.080 --> 06:40.720
It seems to me that
before the Vorlix I helped others.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.080
That is all that I sense.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.800
- Are you?
- A doctor? No... no.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.080
Uh... Well, yes. Um...

06:48.240 --> 06:52.120
I'm a doctor of archaeology.
I study the past.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.880
Then you are a most welcome
visitor here, Daniel.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.400
They were not here
at the time of the Vorlix.

07:00.560 --> 07:04.920
You've done absolutely the right thing
in bringing them here, Orner.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.960
Thank you.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.320
He fervently believes
we are husband and wife...

07:19.480 --> 07:24.840
..and that we need not wait till we regain
our memories to renew our relationship.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.840
Perhaps you can help us.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.120
Please, follow me.

07:40.320 --> 07:44.480
This room has all of the knowledge
and research we've been able to recover.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.040
I've spent every waking hour in here,
reading, searching...

07:48.200 --> 07:51.160
Dispensing whatever
useful information I find.

07:51.840 --> 07:56.680
If you were able to help us, I know
our people would be eternally grateful.

07:56.840 --> 08:00.480
- You seem to have things under control.
- On the contrary, sir.

08:00.640 --> 08:04.560
We're falling apart. Industry and
agriculture on Vyus has come to a halt.

08:04.720 --> 08:09.400
And when winter comes,
it will be disastrous. Nothing less.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.640
- You're not from Vyus.
- What gave us away?

08:16.520 --> 08:20.720
Whatever agent caused the Vorlix is gone,
but its effects were pandemic.

08:20.880 --> 08:24.560
If you know who you are,
then you cannot be of this world.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.040
Oh.

08:26.200 --> 08:30.760
Well, you know that big, round ring thing
stashed in a warehouse down the road?

08:30.920 --> 08:33.039
So it is a transportation device.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.120
- (Teal'c) So it is.
- We call it a Stargate.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.600
Stargate, yes. Um...

08:38.760 --> 08:41.799
Dr Zirvis mentioned
that word in his research.

08:42.679 --> 08:46.960
Though I have given up hope of finding
this Dr Zirvis amongst our people,...

08:47.120 --> 08:49.320
..his papers have taught me much.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.560
Here.

08:53.720 --> 08:59.040
"Our visitor claims to have come to Vyus
from beyond the stars themselves,...

09:01.840 --> 09:06.240
..though I cannot comprehend the science
behind this Stargate device she used."

09:06.400 --> 09:10.040
I have studied this device,
but have been unable to activate it.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.920
Ke'ra, could you go back to the part
about the visitor again?

09:14.080 --> 09:16.400
She's mentioned many times
in the archive.

09:16.560 --> 09:21.040
- What can you tell us about her?
- She was somewhat of an apothecary.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.280
- And she did not survive the Vorlix.
- How do you know?

09:24.440 --> 09:27.920
The bodies of an elder woman and man
were discovered days later...

09:28.080 --> 09:32.080
..in a building destroyed by explosion -
the only remains of elders we've found.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.720
We deduce the male
must have been Dr Zirvis...

09:34.880 --> 09:39.200
..and the female matches what little
description his notes gave of the visitor.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.920
- What is the name of this elder woman?
- It is mentioned.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.120
Here, yes. "She calls herself Linea."

10:06.040 --> 10:07.720
Colonel.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.000
Oh, hi. What's your name?

10:11.000 --> 10:14.120
I have told Dr Fraiser this may be
the planet Linea escaped to.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.840
Possibly. I'd like to know
what we're dealin' with here.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.040
Sounds like a world-class
case of amnesia.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.120
- Check these people out, will ya?
- Yes, sir.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.200
Let's, um... set up over here.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.960
I keep finding references
to something called Dargol.

10:33.120 --> 10:36.520
Yes, I found Dargol was a chemical
once used as a pesticide.

10:36.680 --> 10:41.880
It seems to have had an impact on the
environment and has since been banned.

10:42.040 --> 10:46.800
Yes, we had a similar problem
on my world with a chemical called DDT.

10:46.960 --> 10:51.160
It built up in the food chain
until entire species were threatened.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.640
I first believed that Dargol
was related to our loss of memory,...

10:54.800 --> 10:57.400
..but there's little evidence of it.

10:57.560 --> 11:02.520
I have found residue only in the bodies
of those who have died since the Vorlix.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.600
What?

11:14.760 --> 11:17.240
Sometimes images of people
look familiar to me.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.160
I wonder if I knew
this person or that person.

11:21.800 --> 11:25.600
There are still so many questions.
Why are there no images of children?

11:25.760 --> 11:27.880
Where have our elders gone?

11:29.080 --> 11:31.120
Through your Stargate, perhaps.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.400
Well, it's possible that
your people foresaw a disaster...

11:34.560 --> 11:36.880
..and sent the most helpless to safety.

11:37.040 --> 11:41.120
No, Daniel. Whatever happened
happened quickly, without warning.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.480
How do you know that?

11:44.560 --> 11:49.520
Because, if you saw disaster coming,
you would have left yourselves a note?

11:51.880 --> 11:54.600
Sort of a... "to whom it may concern"?

11:55.480 --> 11:57.400
(Ke'ra giggles)

12:02.840 --> 12:04.760
Sir?

12:06.120 --> 12:08.040
Oh...

12:10.080 --> 12:12.360
I was just thinking about amnesia.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.120
It doesn't quite track
with Linea's nickname.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.040
- Destroyer of Worlds.
- Yeah. That one.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.280
Well, actually,
in sort of a sick way, it does.

12:22.440 --> 12:28.040
Ke'ra said herself their society was on the
verge of collapse. This world is in trouble.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.640
Perhaps Linea was experimenting
with other ways to destroy worlds.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.880
Variety being the spice of life and all?

12:34.040 --> 12:37.600
The fact is, sir,
we let Linea out of Hadante prison.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.160
We gave her all she needed
to know about the Stargates...

12:41.320 --> 12:43.920
- ..to go anywhere she wanted.
- I know.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.160
We're responsible, sir.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.960
I know.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.880
Tell me of Linea.

12:54.040 --> 12:57.840
Well, uh... basically,
we met her on a visit to another planet...

12:58.000 --> 13:04.160
..during which we were imprisoned,
unjustly, and Linea helped us escape.

13:04.320 --> 13:08.760
Well, surely there was nothing wrong
with that if you were imprisoned unjustly.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.120
Well, she was imprisoned justly.

13:12.440 --> 13:16.080
It was after we escaped that we learned
that this nice older lady...

13:16.240 --> 13:22.600
..was in fact a very, very bad older lady
who had committed terrible crimes.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.600
What crimes?

13:24.760 --> 13:28.160
She created a plague that almost
wiped out an entire people.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.440
They called her Destroyer of Worlds.

13:31.640 --> 13:35.960
She found your world because of us,
through one of our computers.

13:36.440 --> 13:40.640
And that's why we're gonna do
everything in our power to help.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.360
I know you will.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.640
I may have something.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.040
What?

13:59.200 --> 14:02.920
I think it's Linea's diary.
I remember seeing her with it.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.760
Your diagnosis was bang on, Major.
Now, sir...

14:09.920 --> 14:13.360
I can either take several weeks
setting up a lab here,...

14:13.520 --> 14:15.760
..going back for computer analysis,...

14:15.920 --> 14:18.640
..or we go back with volunteers,
do a series of MRls...

14:18.800 --> 14:20.640
..and get answers a lot faster.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.560
I would be glad to volunteer,
and so would others.

14:23.720 --> 14:29.240
As long as we maintain proper quarantine
procedures, it shouldn't be a problem, sir.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.720
All right. I'll go back and brief Hammond.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.320
I believe I can help.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.800
I'm sure you can.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.840
(chevrons locking)

15:18.400 --> 15:20.680
You guys go ahead
and show 'em how easy it is.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.720
We'll see you on the other side.

15:29.880 --> 15:33.560
- I... I can't.
- Trust these people, as you trust me.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.840
- You all right?
- Incredible.

16:03.840 --> 16:07.320
- Am I in one piece?
- Yes, Orner. One skinny little piece.

16:14.120 --> 16:18.080
- General Hammond, this is Ke'ra.
- It's a pleasure, Ke'ra.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.240
On behalf of the government of Vyus,...

16:20.400 --> 16:24.160
..we thank you for your generosity
and your support, General.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.840
Daniel, you wanna show 'em
to the infirmary?

16:29.840 --> 16:31.240
Thank you.

16:37.600 --> 16:42.200
Colonel, what if Dr Fraiser is unable
to reverse whatever caused this?

16:44.400 --> 16:46.320
I don't know.

16:48.040 --> 16:52.000
Now, if you look at the blue areas,
you all have the same obstructions...

16:52.160 --> 16:55.400
..in your temporal lobes
and hippocampus of your brain.

16:55.560 --> 17:00.600
I'm not sure what it is, except it's some
sort of residue between the synapses.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.880
So your memories may be intact.
They're just not accessible.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.160
- So their memories are just blocked.
- Literally, yes.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.520
And does this material match
the Dargol residue I gave you?

17:10.680 --> 17:12.599
We'll be able to confirm that quickly.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.920
And if it can be removed
without damaging the neurons...

17:16.079 --> 17:18.160
Then we can be cured.

17:18.319 --> 17:21.720
We need only to find the right medicine
to dissolve the residue.

17:21.880 --> 17:25.640
- It is more difficult than it sounds.
- Then we should start immediately.

17:25.800 --> 17:30.640
Ke'ra, we've been at it for a long time
and I still have some tests to run, so...

17:30.800 --> 17:34.000
- So why don't I give you the 50-cent tour?
- Yes.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.240
Thank you.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.680
Your complex is incredible, Daniel.
Your technology.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.960
I never dreamed of such marvels.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.080
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:01.240 --> 18:04.640
Is it morning or night on the surface?
May we see for ourselves?

18:04.800 --> 18:07.400
Uh... No, not yet. Soon, though, I hope.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.480
I hope so, too.

18:09.640 --> 18:14.600
So this is it. Uh... It's not much of a view,
but it's got all the comforts of...

18:14.760 --> 18:17.240
You've been very kind.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.400
Thank you.

18:20.760 --> 18:24.080
So there are clothes in the... dresser.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.200
- Uh, some are sort of...
- Is my clothing unsuitable?

18:28.360 --> 18:30.440
No! No, no, no.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.560
It's... No, it's, um... It's fine.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.640
I was just, uh...

18:36.880 --> 18:38.800
Are you hungry?

18:39.880 --> 18:41.800
Uh, cos...

18:42.360 --> 18:45.160
I can... I can have them
send something down.

18:45.320 --> 18:48.720
You're hungry. I'm hungry. Let's get
something. You want something?

18:48.880 --> 18:50.800
- Yes.
- Right.

18:52.040 --> 18:57.200
Since the Vorlix, close contact
has become... almost taboo.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.600
We were afraid that if we ever
regained our memories...

19:00.760 --> 19:03.800
Mm-hm. You'd find yourself
waking up beside the wrong person.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.560
But you... are not from Vyus.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.880
No, I'm not from... there.
From Vyus, no. No.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.000
Ke'ra...

19:15.920 --> 19:18.240
- I understand.
- No. You don't.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.640
I mean, um... OK.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.120
I'm finding myself very, very... very...

19:27.640 --> 19:29.560
But, uh...

19:31.200 --> 19:34.120
The fact is I've only
just recently lost my wife.

19:36.240 --> 19:40.840
And, uh... Well, that's not totally true.
I actually really lost her a long time ago.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.440
But the fact is I don't think
I would trust myself completely to...

20:01.120 --> 20:04.000
- I'm sorry. I interrupted you.
- No, you didn't. No, uh...

20:04.160 --> 20:06.560
- I wasn't gonna say...
- I had to do that.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.720
I had to do that in case,...

20:08.880 --> 20:12.480
..when my memory returns,
I find myself attached to someone else...

20:12.640 --> 20:15.400
..and I am unable to ever do it again.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.600
Right. I understand. That's...

20:21.160 --> 20:23.400
That's probably why I should do this.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.120
- You were lookin' for me?
- Yes, sir.

20:37.280 --> 20:39.280
I've been studying Linea's journals.

20:39.440 --> 20:45.360
She found a link between Dargol -
it's a chemical pesticide - and longevity.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.760
What's a bug spray to do with longevity?

20:48.080 --> 20:51.240
It seems it was having the effect
of slowing the ageing process.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.480
Not in an extreme way,
but certainly significant enough.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.640
- Lucky bugs.
- Yes and no.

20:56.800 --> 21:02.040
They stopped using it over 20 years ago.
It was adversely affecting their fertility.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.680
- So no kids.
- Right.

21:04.840 --> 21:09.160
Linea was trying to enhance
the life-extending properties of Dargol...

21:09.320 --> 21:13.560
- ..to create a sort of Fountain of Youth.
- She was trying to make herself young?

21:13.800 --> 21:18.440
According to her last entry, Linea was
about to conduct some lab experiments,...

21:18.600 --> 21:22.600
..using an intensely concentrated form
of Dargol, on two Vyan elders.

21:22.760 --> 21:25.000
A male and a female.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.560
And?

21:26.720 --> 21:29.520
And... that's where her journal ends.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.960
Ah!

21:32.480 --> 21:35.440
- The Vorlix, perhaps?
- Exactly.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.560
What if there was a laboratory accident?

21:37.720 --> 21:42.080
A massive chain reaction of enhanced
Dargol gas that caught Linea by surprise.

21:42.240 --> 21:45.600
The entire population
becomes young again overnight.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.480
You realise, of course, the implication.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.200
No.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.120
Um...

21:55.280 --> 21:59.920
Their elders aren't missing, sir.
They are the elders.

22:00.440 --> 22:04.760
The Fountain of Youth worked.
The amnesia was simply a side effect.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.840
Uh... Wait a minute.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.760
Linea is dead, right?

22:10.640 --> 22:12.000
Well...

22:12.160 --> 22:16.400
If the two bodies that Ke'ra found were
the elders Linea was experimenting on...

22:16.560 --> 22:20.240
- Don't say it, Carter.
- Sir, we wouldn't recognise her.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.240
Don't. Don't... (sings) La la la...

22:22.400 --> 22:26.240
Sir, she has the knowledge of chemistry,
the medical skills.

22:28.320 --> 22:33.000
I think we have to at least face
the possibility that Ke'ra is Linea.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.280
(Hammond) She's also
a victim of the amnesia?

22:38.440 --> 22:40.640
- (O'Neill) It fits.
- It fits.

22:41.720 --> 22:46.320
What about the body of the old woman
they found that fits Linea's description?

22:46.480 --> 22:48.120
Linea's first victim.

22:48.280 --> 22:51.160
Daniel, you saw the test results.
What more do you need?

22:51.320 --> 22:55.320
Ke'ra's DNA matches the samples
I took from Linea. It's irrefutable.

22:55.640 --> 22:59.120
Irrefutable! OK! So let's just lock her up,
throw away the key.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.200
Or send her back to where we found her.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.840
Linea, Daniel.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.120
She used to be Linea.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.440
We're lucky she didn't
knock us off before.

23:09.600 --> 23:13.640
A question. Who would you trust with
your life more than anyone in the world?

23:13.800 --> 23:17.960
I won't be offended if you don't pick me.
Could it be Teal'c?

23:18.120 --> 23:19.280
Sure.

23:19.440 --> 23:23.400
Teal'c, just refresh my memory.
What was your previous occupation?

23:25.440 --> 23:28.080
- I was first prime of Apophis.
- Right.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.840
- Did a few nasty things back then?
- We see the point you're trying to make.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.080
No, you don't.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.640
She is not the same person.

23:39.560 --> 23:42.120
She is not who she used to be.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.640
Let's not condemn her
for who she may have been in the past.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.880
I think we should keep her
confined to her quarters...

23:52.040 --> 23:54.960
..until we can resolve
the Vyans' medical crisis.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.560
- Colonel O'Neill, perhaps you'd inform...
- I'll inform her.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.080
Daniel!

24:18.240 --> 24:20.160
What's wrong?

24:22.120 --> 24:26.240
- We have work to do.
- There are... quarantine procedures...

24:26.400 --> 24:29.600
..that General Hammond is insisting on.
He's, uh...

24:32.000 --> 24:35.320
- You have to stay here a while.
- But I am not contagious.

24:35.480 --> 24:38.240
- I know.
- Then why?

24:40.160 --> 24:45.720
I can't tell you everything, but the Vorlix
was more than just losing your memories.

24:45.880 --> 24:50.760
- Is that why there are guards outside?
- No. That's standard procedure.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.720
- If you say so.
- I do... say so.

24:56.800 --> 25:00.720
So... I'll come visit you
in a little while, OK?

25:00.880 --> 25:03.880
Is Dr Fraiser still working
towards a cure for amnesia?

25:04.040 --> 25:06.920
Yes... Yes, she is.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.960
- So I can rest assured?
- Yes.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.800
Oh, my!

25:24.960 --> 25:28.200
There is a distinct lack of
optimism in this room.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.760
We've been working to dissolve
a chemical inside the brain...

25:31.920 --> 25:34.880
..without harming surrounding tissue
and it is not easy.

25:35.040 --> 25:38.920
- What have you learned?
- That it could take years, sir.

25:39.360 --> 25:41.400
We don't have that much time.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.720
Unless we get help.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.280
From...?

25:47.440 --> 25:49.360
Ke'ra, sir.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.720
- Absolutely not.
- (Fraiser) Sir.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.880
I don't like the idea any more than you.

25:56.040 --> 26:00.040
But without her knowledge of
biochemistry, especially of Dargol,...

26:00.200 --> 26:04.400
..we may not reverse the amnesia in time
to prevent a catastrophe on Vyus.

26:04.680 --> 26:07.880
Doctor, you're asking me to allow
a known homicidal maniac...

26:08.040 --> 26:10.440
..to work with potentially
lethal substances.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.720
Yes, sir. But with all due respect,
Daniel may be right.

26:14.760 --> 26:19.440
Ke'ra may be an entirely different person
than Linea without Linea's memories.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.880
Excuse me! Amnesia check.

26:23.880 --> 26:27.040
- "Destroyer of Worlds"?
- (Carter) Sir...

26:27.480 --> 26:30.360
Ke'ra wants nothing more
than to help her people.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.840
As long as she doesn't take the antidote...

26:33.000 --> 26:39.200
- There won't be one without her help.
- So... it's up to you, sirs.

26:42.880 --> 26:46.600
I think a precaution or two
might be in order, sir.

26:46.960 --> 26:49.360
You're right about that, Colonel.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.360
It's all right.

27:05.520 --> 27:08.240
- What have I done, Daniel?
- Nothing.

27:08.400 --> 27:12.280
They're just going to escort us
to the medical lab. I'll stay with you.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.360
Dr Fraiser needs your help.

27:23.360 --> 27:27.440
Be careful, Ke'ra. That could become
unstable or even explosive.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.480
An unbalanced mixture
could create a poisonous gas.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.960
We must not exceed a 3% solution.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.320
OK. 3%.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.120
- She's brilliant.
- Yes, she is.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.000
She's so far ahead of us, Daniel,
it's frightening.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.920
There is some danger.
I would like to test it on myself.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.880
- That's not an option.
- May I ask why?

27:52.040 --> 27:55.120
Because if it's unsuccessful,
we'll need your help again.

27:55.280 --> 27:59.720
If it's unsuccessful, Orner may die.
I would never forgive myself.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.080
Then I forgive you now.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.600
I know how important
this is to our people.

28:09.400 --> 28:13.440
It must be injected directly into
the carotid artery. Right here.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.200
You ready?

28:17.360 --> 28:19.520
(heart monitor bleeps)

28:26.280 --> 28:29.640
How do you feel?
The effect should be almost immediate.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.240
- I feel something.
- (faster bleeping)

28:33.560 --> 28:35.760
Are you recalling anything?

28:37.640 --> 28:38.880
Orner!

28:39.040 --> 28:41.400
Help me hold him down.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.440
(continuous bleep)

28:50.720 --> 28:53.960
He's not breathing.
There's no pulse. It's a code blue!

28:57.920 --> 28:59.920
One, and two, and three, and four...

29:03.880 --> 29:05.600
Come on.

29:10.920 --> 29:13.080
Wait a minute. He's stabilising.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.280
(regular bleeping)

29:22.760 --> 29:24.680
Help me get him up.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.960
There.

29:28.320 --> 29:30.600
Ke'ra.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.680
Do you remember?

29:35.240 --> 29:39.000
- I am sorry.
- Next time it will work.

29:39.880 --> 29:43.360
I believe I know where I miscalculated.
May we begin again?

29:43.520 --> 29:45.760
Let's see how Orner feels in a little while.

29:45.920 --> 29:49.280
The effect would have been immediate.
We must try again.

29:49.440 --> 29:53.240
Dr Fraiser's right.
We should probably take a break.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.320
As you wish.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.520
- Daniel, may we speak alone?
- Yes.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.240
I'm just gonna stay for a minute.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.680
- I will accompany you.
- Teal'c.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.680
I'm concerned only for your welfare,
Daniel Jackson.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.840
I know.

30:40.760 --> 30:43.480
- Very well.
- Thank you.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.480
- They believe I am Linea.
- Yes.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.800
Do you?

31:05.280 --> 31:08.720
The Vorlix made
the population of Vyus younger.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.000
Years younger.

31:12.040 --> 31:16.120
You couldn't find the elders
because... you were the elders.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.000
How can you believe that?

31:20.160 --> 31:23.320
There is a test.
It compares what we call DNA.

31:24.400 --> 31:29.560
- It proves you and Linea are one person.
- Well, the test is wrong. I'm not Linea.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.840
No, you're not.

31:33.080 --> 31:35.200
You're Ke'ra now.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.280
Ke'ra's wonderful.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.680
And as long as you remain that person,
that will never change.

31:46.120 --> 31:50.000
You're telling me that I will never
be able to take the antidote.

31:51.960 --> 31:54.040
I would never harm anyone, Daniel.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.640
Do you believe me?

32:00.360 --> 32:02.280
I do.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.920
Hey!

32:22.080 --> 32:24.080
Heard the test didn't go too well.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.280
She'll figure it out.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.160
Listen.

32:29.320 --> 32:34.160
I'm not saying the first woman you've
fallen for since Sha're isn't a peach,...

32:35.200 --> 32:39.040
..but if she remembers who she is,
you'll be the first to go.

32:58.240 --> 33:01.440
The 800-microlitre potency
is ready for a prelim.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.720
- May l?
- Yes.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.680
It's working.

33:27.560 --> 33:30.640
- You're right.
- This potency will provide our antidote.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.760
Great. Thank you, Ke'ra.
We'll take it from here.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.280
But I can assist you.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.640
Uh... Ke'ra...

33:39.280 --> 33:42.680
We should perform the test
once more to be sure.

33:42.840 --> 33:46.120
I think it's better if we do this ourselves.
Thank you.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.280
I see.

33:48.440 --> 33:51.000
May I return later to observe the test?

33:51.600 --> 33:54.680
- Sure.
- Thank you.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.639
This time it will work.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.679
Are you feeling any pain?

34:34.840 --> 34:36.960
Something. Not pain.

34:59.160 --> 35:01.080
Orner, are you all right?

35:01.960 --> 35:04.280
My real name is Nodaal.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.120
I remember everything. Thank you.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.360
And are we married after all?

35:15.040 --> 35:17.160
No.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.280
I'm afraid I am married to Layale.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.120
And who's that?

35:24.680 --> 35:27.560
You. For 43 years!

35:30.640 --> 35:33.640
Before the Vorlix,
you and I had not met yet.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.720
I am pleased for you.

35:37.240 --> 35:39.560
You must take the antidote now.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.080
I cannot.

35:46.280 --> 35:48.600
They will explain.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.920
What will be done with me?

36:12.880 --> 36:16.720
If you don't take the antidote, I see
no reason why you can't go back to Vyus.

36:16.880 --> 36:20.160
- I intend to ask them.
- They'll fear me. I would.

36:22.360 --> 36:25.720
For all that you've done for them,
they'll be grateful.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.560
All debts have now been paid.

36:35.840 --> 36:39.720
I'll come back after I've had a chance
to speak with your people.

36:42.080 --> 36:44.200
I shall miss you, Daniel.

36:58.640 --> 37:01.600
- You've taken the antidote.
- Leave, Daniel.

37:07.600 --> 37:11.960
You said "All debts have now been paid."
That was the message Linea left behind.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.280
Was it?

37:13.440 --> 37:17.280
- Did you take the antidote?
- I had to know! I didn't believe you!

37:17.440 --> 37:20.160
- Ke'ra.
- I'm not Ke'ra, am l?

37:21.040 --> 37:23.960
- I am the murderer that you said I was.
- No, you're not.

37:24.120 --> 37:27.880
I need only smash these vials together
to create a poisonous gas in this room.

37:28.040 --> 37:31.720
I only want to harm myself.
I don't want you to be here, please.

37:32.720 --> 37:35.680
You'll have to kill me, too,
because I'm staying.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.760
All right, Layale. You're next.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.320
Colonel, a vial and ampoule are missing.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.360
I deserve to die.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.600
- I don't believe that.
- You don't understand.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.880
There's a part of me
that cares for you, Daniel.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.960
More than I've cared
for anyone I've ever known.

38:12.840 --> 38:16.560
But there is this other part of me
that would gladly watch you die!

38:17.320 --> 38:19.920
- Step aside, Daniel.
- Don't! There's another way.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.040
Move!

38:21.200 --> 38:25.760
- Give me the vials. You need not do this.
- There are two people inside of me.

38:26.920 --> 38:28.840
And one of them is a monster.

38:30.840 --> 38:33.400
In time, she will win.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.280
You won't hurt me
because there's another way, Ke'ra.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.040
I'm not her!

38:39.000 --> 38:41.320
No, you're not.

38:41.800 --> 38:44.200
But you can be her again.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.920
You can forget.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.040
All you have to do is forget.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.280
Ke'ra...

39:13.080 --> 39:15.160
It's all right.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.280
You're among friends.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.760
Do you remember anything?

39:22.320 --> 39:24.240
Nothing.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.600
Your name is Ke'ra.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.600
You've been a visitor here.

39:32.480 --> 39:35.120
Now it's time to go home.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.440
- (Layale) She did this willingly?
- Yes.

39:45.600 --> 39:49.920
With her help, we were able to synthesise
a small amount of the enhanced Dargol...

39:50.080 --> 39:52.720
..and reintroduce it into her bloodstream.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.000
Her memory is gone again.

39:59.240 --> 40:04.000
Ke'ra, these are friends of mine -
Teal'c, Jack, General Hammond, Sam.

40:04.160 --> 40:08.080
And these are friends of yours.
They've come to take you home.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.480
- Do you know me?
- We do, Ke'ra.

40:12.640 --> 40:16.400
We understand
that you've lost your memory.

40:16.560 --> 40:21.080
Know that you are a great leader of
our people, and you are most welcome.

40:25.320 --> 40:29.600
I sense we knew each other well
before my memory was lost.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.800
Did we?

40:34.600 --> 40:35.520
No.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.600
No, we never really did.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.520
Goodbye, Ke'ra.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.560
Goodbye.

41:13.840 --> 41:17.960
