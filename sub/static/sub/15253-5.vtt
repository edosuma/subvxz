00:26.309 --> 00:28.209
That was easy.

00:31.312 --> 00:33.413
Yeah, too easy.

00:36.315 --> 00:38.015
Wasn't even fun.

00:38.016 --> 00:40.117
Speak for yourself.

00:40.184 --> 00:42.084
I like easy.

00:46.020 --> 00:47.955
Can it!

00:48.022 --> 00:49.924
We have work to do.

00:52.694 --> 00:54.594
Mac, get the panel.

01:06.406 --> 01:09.675
All right, let's have
a look, boys.

01:12.276 --> 01:15.110
There's enough gold in here
for us all to retire...

01:15.178 --> 01:17.044
five times.

01:17.045 --> 01:19.380
That gold's being used
to secretly fund terrorists.

01:19.447 --> 01:20.447
We're under strict orders

01:20.448 --> 01:21.615
from President Clinton

01:21.616 --> 01:23.350
to seal this place up.

01:23.351 --> 01:26.253
While I may not like him
or his mouthy wife,

01:26.321 --> 01:27.354
those are the orders.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.688
Anyone tries to open this door-

01:29.755 --> 01:31.655
boom!

01:32.356 --> 01:34.524
I'm just saying, you know?

01:34.591 --> 01:35.858
Hidden in a vault...

01:35.859 --> 01:38.226
hidden in our bags,

01:38.294 --> 01:40.728
what's the difference, Casey?

01:40.796 --> 01:43.363
The difference is
that wasn't our mission.

01:43.430 --> 01:45.464
Is that gonna be a problem
for you, Packard?

01:45.532 --> 01:48.433
Well, actually,
it is a problem for you.

01:51.703 --> 01:53.603
You're outnumbered, pal.

01:54.839 --> 01:56.439
You're both with him, huh?

01:56.440 --> 01:58.608
I'd like to retire young.

01:58.675 --> 02:01.042
Maybe move to Boca.

02:01.110 --> 02:02.644
You can't
blame the boys

02:02.645 --> 02:04.545
for thinking about
their future, Casey.

02:38.774 --> 02:41.108
You'll have plenty of time
to think about your futures...

02:41.176 --> 02:44.210
in Leavenworth.

02:54.752 --> 02:56.786
Casey, Jeffrey
and I were feeling

02:56.854 --> 02:59.887
nostalgic for the days
of the old Buy More.

02:59.955 --> 03:02.056
So we decided, you know
what would make

03:02.123 --> 03:04.257
this place feel
like home again?

03:04.325 --> 03:06.125
Getting the gang
back together.

03:06.126 --> 03:07.193
You in, C-note?

03:07.194 --> 03:08.828
I was never in your gang.

03:08.829 --> 03:09.928
So what do you say,
Friday night,

03:09.929 --> 03:11.630
a little white zin,

03:11.631 --> 03:13.464
a little <i>Magic:</i>
<i>The Gathering?</i>

03:13.465 --> 03:17.634
If you have the mana to battle
the other Planeswalkers.

03:18.969 --> 03:20.869
"Have the ma..."
This guy.

03:21.638 --> 03:25.741
You think about it,
let us know.

03:35.016 --> 03:36.517
Symmetrical thing...

03:36.518 --> 03:38.385
Guess who?

03:38.386 --> 03:40.487
Okay, soft, perfumed hands...

03:40.554 --> 03:42.121
sweet, sweet feminine voice...

03:42.122 --> 03:45.557
Chuck? That's easy.
I would know that any...

03:45.625 --> 03:47.225
Ah, it's Alex!
Aw, that's even better!

03:47.226 --> 03:49.126
Hey!

03:49.562 --> 03:51.562
Boom.

03:51.630 --> 03:53.763
Wait a minute. Did you...
Did you just fist bump me?

03:53.831 --> 03:56.265
Yeah, that's right because
I blow it up with everybody.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.067
Did you know that?
I do. I get...

03:58.068 --> 03:59.735
I get silly with that,
and, uh...

03:59.736 --> 04:01.035
Come on, Morgan.
We're not buds.

04:01.036 --> 04:02.470
We're dating.

04:02.471 --> 04:05.005
I know that. I know
we're dating, you know.

04:05.073 --> 04:08.978
Just, you know, not everybody
here knows that we're dating.

04:09.045 --> 04:13.649
Morgan, you said that you were
gonna talk to my dad about us.

04:13.716 --> 04:14.916
I was going to.

04:14.917 --> 04:17.152
I was. Check this out.
Such a funny story...

04:17.219 --> 04:18.486
Morgan, I get it.

04:18.487 --> 04:21.188
My dad, he's very intimidating.

04:21.255 --> 04:22.522
No, not, not the...

04:22.523 --> 04:24.190
But it's really important to me

04:24.191 --> 04:25.525
that we're honest with him,

04:25.526 --> 04:26.726
you know?

04:26.727 --> 04:27.893
Yeah.

04:27.894 --> 04:29.795
I have to get to class
in 15, but...

04:29.863 --> 04:31.496
I will talk
to you later!

04:31.497 --> 04:33.397
Absolutely.

04:35.568 --> 04:38.169
♪ ♪

04:38.236 --> 04:39.469
Still haven't told
Casey yet, huh?

04:39.470 --> 04:41.203
No.

04:41.204 --> 04:44.173
Well, be careful how you
break the news to him.

04:44.241 --> 04:46.141
He might kill you
accidentally.

04:48.177 --> 04:49.744
Sound advice, Chuck.
Thank you.

04:49.745 --> 04:51.645
Yeah, you know,
anytime.

04:51.646 --> 04:53.681
Um, buddy, can you,
can you do me a favor?

04:53.748 --> 04:54.815
Of course.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.382
Um, could you cover
for me up here?

04:56.383 --> 04:58.984
I got a little work
to do downstairs.

04:59.052 --> 05:00.952
We just got a file
from Costa Gravas

05:00.987 --> 05:02.387
detailing all of their
interactions

05:02.388 --> 05:04.455
with the Volkoff Organization
over the years.

05:04.523 --> 05:06.657
Volkoff? I mean, that's
good. This will lead

05:06.724 --> 05:07.957
back to your mother, right?

05:07.958 --> 05:09.425
Yeah, I certainly hope so.

05:09.426 --> 05:11.494
I mean, ever since I told Ellie
about the search,

05:11.562 --> 05:13.663
the pressure's really been on
to find her.

05:13.731 --> 05:17.133
Ellie deserves to know the truth
just as much as I do, so...

05:17.200 --> 05:18.801
Okay, I've gone through all
of these files,

05:18.802 --> 05:20.435
Chuck, and there is
nothing on your mom.

05:20.436 --> 05:24.538
Okay, okay, so maybe there's
nothing on "Frost" per se,

05:24.605 --> 05:26.806
but perhaps there's something
"Frost-adjacent."

05:26.874 --> 05:28.942
You know, something
that could lead us to her?

05:29.010 --> 05:30.310
What about Volkoff's prisons?

05:30.311 --> 05:31.778
What do you mean?

05:31.779 --> 05:34.014
Volkoff has a network of "black
sites" across the world;

05:34.081 --> 05:35.582
basically,
a private prison system

05:35.583 --> 05:37.316
run by extraction specialists.

05:37.317 --> 05:38.985
And if anybody is gonna know

05:38.986 --> 05:41.788
where Volkoff's prisoners are
held, it's these guys.

05:49.429 --> 05:54.532
Sarah, those guys used to work
for someone we know.

05:54.599 --> 05:56.900
After I secured the gold using
my handprint,

05:56.968 --> 05:59.803
I dragged my former "team"
halfway across the desert,

05:59.871 --> 06:02.906
thereby saving their miserable,
mutinous lives.

06:02.974 --> 06:05.008
Oh, okay.
Then what happened?

06:05.076 --> 06:06.676
I had 'em court-martialed.

06:06.677 --> 06:07.944
Of course, they promptly escaped

06:07.945 --> 06:09.945
from a maximum security
stockade.

06:10.013 --> 06:11.847
To the Los Angeles underground,

06:11.848 --> 06:13.980
where they survived as soldiers
of fortune.

06:15.382 --> 06:18.317
It's like <i>The</i> <i>A-Team.</i>
You never...

06:18.385 --> 06:19.918
Have you ever seen
<i>The A-Team?</i>

06:19.919 --> 06:21.186
I <i>was</i> The A-Team.

06:21.187 --> 06:22.187
Ah.

06:22.188 --> 06:23.655
They've taken a couple of shots

06:23.656 --> 06:25.089
at me over the years.

06:25.090 --> 06:27.758
The last time, I taught them
to stay hidden.

06:27.826 --> 06:29.461
Well, is there anything
you can tell us

06:29.462 --> 06:31.430
about how we might
be able to find them now?

06:31.498 --> 06:34.733
Casey, these guys may be the key
to locating my mom.

06:34.801 --> 06:37.034
The only place I can think of
to get these three

06:37.102 --> 06:39.135
sons of bitches back together
would be my funeral.

06:41.205 --> 06:43.307
That's it!

06:43.374 --> 06:46.243
Casey, I know how
to find your old team.

06:47.879 --> 06:49.746
We have to kill you.

06:49.747 --> 06:55.747
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

07:34.215 --> 07:37.682
Let me get this right: You want
to use government resources

07:37.750 --> 07:39.851
to stage a fake funeral
for Colonel Casey?

07:39.918 --> 07:42.287
Well, yes, uh, General,
I believe we have

07:42.355 --> 07:44.356
a unique opportunity here
to set a trap

07:44.423 --> 07:46.824
for Casey's old team, who
happen to be Volkoff agents.

07:46.892 --> 07:48.693
If they think I'm dead,
they'll come for this.

07:48.694 --> 07:49.927
My handprint's the only way

07:49.928 --> 07:51.162
they're gonna access
that Iranian vault.

07:51.163 --> 07:52.363
Here's the plan:

07:52.364 --> 07:54.131
First, we spread the news
of Casey's death

07:54.132 --> 07:55.565
through all the back channels

07:55.566 --> 07:57.701
that civilians don't monitor
but Volkoff does.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.668
Next up, we kill the Colonel.

07:59.703 --> 08:00.969
You want him to play dead?

08:00.970 --> 08:01.970
I'll be drugged, ma'am.

08:01.971 --> 08:03.239
When Casey's former team

08:03.240 --> 08:04.373
sees Casey's actual body,

08:04.374 --> 08:05.941
we believe they'll drop
their guard,

08:05.942 --> 08:07.043
giving us the upper hand.

08:07.044 --> 08:08.710
And then we'll move in.

08:08.711 --> 08:11.079
We will control every
entrance and exit.

08:11.146 --> 08:13.046
Snipers will posted
and at the ready.

08:13.048 --> 08:15.681
And the audience will
be filled with agents

08:15.749 --> 08:17.083
that we've planted there.

08:17.084 --> 08:20.519
All right. You've clearly
thought this through.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.720
The mission is a go.

08:21.721 --> 08:23.088
Thank you, General.

08:23.089 --> 08:25.589
Colonel Casey, Agent Walker,
you're both dismissed.

08:25.657 --> 08:29.192
I'd like a word
with Agent Bartowski alone.

08:36.599 --> 08:40.232
I'm impressed; you've really
progressed as a spy.

08:40.301 --> 08:43.366
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you very much.

08:43.433 --> 08:45.902
But I'm not sure
if I know what you mean.

08:45.970 --> 08:48.170
You've put duty above emotion.

08:48.238 --> 08:50.373
I mean, using Colonel Casey
as bait?

08:50.441 --> 08:52.541
It usually takes years before
an agent is willing

08:52.609 --> 08:54.576
to put his teammates
in harm's way.

08:54.644 --> 08:57.078
Good tactical thinking,
Bartowski.

08:58.113 --> 09:00.013
Hmm.

09:01.451 --> 09:03.651
Hmm, these pesky dress uniforms
get a little tight

09:03.719 --> 09:05.419
when you don't wear 'em
for a while.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.987
Listen, Casey,
just want you to know

09:06.988 --> 09:08.389
that if you feel the mission is

09:08.390 --> 09:10.390
a little too dangerous
and you need to back out

09:10.458 --> 09:12.625
for any reason- I mean, I know
that you and Alex have just

09:12.693 --> 09:14.594
reestablished this kind of
father-daughter connection right now...

09:14.662 --> 09:17.029
Walker will be there.
It'll be fine.

09:17.097 --> 09:18.664
I'm serious, Casey...

09:18.665 --> 09:20.465
Why don't you just stick
to the mission?

09:20.466 --> 09:22.900
Tell me about the drug you're
gonna use to kill me, hmm?

09:22.968 --> 09:24.001
What's it called,
Fake-a-deathanol?

09:24.002 --> 09:25.402
Cute.

09:25.403 --> 09:27.504
No. As a matter
of fact,

09:27.572 --> 09:29.506
it's called Tetrodotoxin.

09:29.574 --> 09:31.675
Normally it would just kill you
outright,

09:31.743 --> 09:33.076
but we've modified it so it'll

09:33.077 --> 09:34.344
just slow down your breathing
and heart rate.

09:34.345 --> 09:36.246
Outstanding.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.214
You will come across as being
very, very dead,

09:38.249 --> 09:40.383
but in actuality, you'll
be very much alive and awake-

09:40.451 --> 09:42.085
however, paralyzed.
I'll show you how it works.

09:42.086 --> 09:45.521
No, it's not like it's the first
time I ever faked my own death.

09:45.588 --> 09:48.089
About that,
because you've been exposed

09:48.157 --> 09:50.291
to so many truth serums
and tranquilizers

09:50.359 --> 09:53.960
and what-have-you's throughout
your very long and colorful career,

09:54.028 --> 09:55.361
we're not exactly sure

09:55.362 --> 09:57.530
how long the drug's effects will
last in your system,

09:57.597 --> 09:59.064
so I'm gonna take the liberty

09:59.065 --> 10:00.966
of stashing an extra hypo
on your person.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.601
I'd like a little alone time
before I die.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.637
One more thing,

10:05.704 --> 10:07.272
one more thing,
A little thing, uh...

10:07.273 --> 10:09.708
Because Sarah and I are gonna be
busy during all of this,

10:09.776 --> 10:12.644
we're gonna need someone
to deliver a eulogy.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.279
I was thinking...

10:14.280 --> 10:15.614
Of course I'll do it.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.649
Oh, man, what am I gonna talk
about, though?

10:17.717 --> 10:18.917
I'm getting
a little nervous, actually.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.118
I think I'm starting
to sweat.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.452
Is that normal before a mish?

10:21.453 --> 10:23.387
Can-Can I do that?
Can I all it a "mish"?

10:23.455 --> 10:24.789
Sure, whatever, yeah.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.224
I just thought, given
the Alex situation of it all,

10:27.292 --> 10:28.992
this is the perfect opportunity
for you

10:28.993 --> 10:31.360
to get in Casey's good graces.
I mean think about it.

10:31.428 --> 10:33.862
Hel have no choice
but to just lie there

10:33.930 --> 10:36.398
and listen to every nice thing
that you have to say.

10:36.465 --> 10:38.567
See? This is why you,
this is why...

10:39.669 --> 10:40.702
Are you expecting somebody?

10:40.703 --> 10:41.870
No...

10:41.871 --> 10:44.506
Hey!
Hi.

10:44.573 --> 10:46.106
We have news.

10:46.107 --> 10:47.973
On the count of three, okay?

10:47.974 --> 10:49.207
Ready? One...

10:49.208 --> 10:51.474
It's a girl!

10:51.541 --> 10:53.108
Wow! Hey, wow.
Amazing.

10:53.109 --> 10:55.543
I- I didn't know you guys
were hoping for a girl.

10:55.610 --> 10:57.244
Oh, we would have been
happy either way,

10:57.245 --> 10:58.845
but I'm just excited
to see my babe

10:58.846 --> 11:00.046
with a papoose
strapped to her.

11:00.047 --> 11:01.881
Is that weird
that I find that hot?

11:01.882 --> 11:03.949
I don't
- yeah, it's kind of... I don't know what a papoose is.

11:04.016 --> 11:05.583
Papoose. It's a good
time for them to drink.

11:05.584 --> 11:07.284
I can't do that, obviously,
but why don't you guys...

11:07.285 --> 11:08.352
Oh, yeah!
Yeah, pop it up!

11:08.353 --> 11:09.386
Let's do it,
let's do it.

11:09.387 --> 11:10.853
Congratulations.
Thank you, thank you.

11:10.854 --> 11:12.921
Can I talk to you
for a minute? Yeah.

11:14.925 --> 11:18.394
Uh, well, it's-it's about Mom.

11:18.462 --> 11:20.996
I know that I said I was worried
about you looking for her,

11:21.063 --> 11:22.230
but I changed my mind.

11:22.231 --> 11:24.531
I... I want to know
what happened to her.

11:24.599 --> 11:28.035
Uh, what-what made you
change your mind?

11:28.103 --> 11:31.940
I just got to thinking, you
know, I'm having a little girl,

11:32.008 --> 11:35.378
and... is she ever
going to know her grandmother?

11:39.382 --> 11:42.717
Uh, well, I just found
a promising lead.

11:42.784 --> 11:44.418
So if it goes anywhere,

11:44.419 --> 11:46.353
you'll be the first
to know, okay?

11:46.420 --> 11:47.554
Okay.

11:47.555 --> 11:49.289
All right.
Let's have some champagne.

11:49.290 --> 11:50.524
Great.
Well, I'll have a drink.

11:50.525 --> 11:52.425
You will, for me. You
can have some water.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.965
He looks so
peaceful.

12:02.602 --> 12:05.303
Oh, whoa!
That's freaky.

12:05.371 --> 12:07.738
I didn't know he could do that.
Did you know he could do that?

12:07.806 --> 12:08.805
I knew he could do that.

12:08.806 --> 12:10.440
Stop doing that.

12:10.441 --> 12:11.441
Don't stare at me.

12:11.442 --> 12:13.709
Okay, I got to go
over my notes.

12:13.777 --> 12:15.111
Listen to me.

12:15.112 --> 12:16.412
Don't you worry about a thing.

12:16.413 --> 12:18.480
I am gonna eulogize
the hell out of you, buddy.

12:18.548 --> 12:20.014

12:20.015 --> 12:22.116

Hey, Alex, it's me, Morgan.

12:34.394 --> 12:37.297
In case you don't
recognize my voice yet.

12:37.364 --> 12:38.598
That's my voice.

12:38.599 --> 12:41.135
Just wanted to call you
and let you know that, uh,

12:41.203 --> 12:43.505
I'm going to tell your dad
about us today.

12:43.572 --> 12:45.139
I got the perfect spot for it.

12:45.140 --> 12:48.775
Do you find it kind of sad that
the only people who showed up

12:48.843 --> 12:50.944
for Casey's funeral
are the agents

12:51.011 --> 12:52.812
that we
planted here?

12:52.813 --> 12:54.180
That's not true.

12:54.181 --> 12:57.049
Is it?

13:05.224 --> 13:07.293
No, no,
you're right.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.595
There are people here
who also hate him.

13:11.498 --> 13:13.398
Target one is in position.

13:24.543 --> 13:26.443
What?

13:28.180 --> 13:29.779
He just stabbed
him with a pin.

13:29.780 --> 13:31.380
He can still feel
pain, you know.

13:31.381 --> 13:33.281
Yeah, he's gonna be okay.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.721
Just let him know, "Casey,
I'm dating your daughter.

13:43.789 --> 13:44.822
"End of story.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.390
Uh-uh, end of story."

13:46.391 --> 13:48.291
Take charge.

13:51.696 --> 13:53.696
Showtime.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.301
Please be seated.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.870
Whoa, sorry.

14:00.871 --> 14:02.605
You're sitting.

14:02.606 --> 14:05.308
You know, if there was
one word I'd choose

14:05.375 --> 14:08.143
to describe John Casey,

14:08.211 --> 14:11.313
that word would be:
"forgiveness."

14:11.381 --> 14:15.450
Big, gun-loving,
Commie-hating forgiveness.

14:15.517 --> 14:18.652
There was something I wanted
to tell John before he,

14:18.720 --> 14:20.221
before he passed.

14:20.222 --> 14:22.189
There's something I need
to get off my chest.

14:22.257 --> 14:24.158
Oh, no...
I- I know John is

14:24.226 --> 14:27.328
somewhere out there...

14:27.396 --> 14:29.030
beneath the pale moonlight,

14:29.031 --> 14:30.931
listening intently.

14:33.637 --> 14:36.872
I wanted to tell him
how handsome he was.

14:36.940 --> 14:38.540
And I never got
a chance, darn it.

14:38.541 --> 14:40.074
That man could
fill out a uniform.

14:40.075 --> 14:42.343
That's not a physique
of a middle-aged man.

14:42.411 --> 14:45.581
Am I right or am I right
or, uh, or am I right?

14:45.649 --> 14:47.549
'Cause- it's hot in here,
isn't it?

14:50.655 --> 14:54.525
But so what else is there to say
about, about John Casey?

14:54.593 --> 14:56.127
Well, he was
a big man.

14:56.128 --> 14:58.229
Big biceps,
big hands.

14:58.296 --> 14:59.964
I used to call them mitts.
You know, they were

14:59.965 --> 15:01.298
like giant mitts
that could fit

15:01.299 --> 15:03.500
all the way around
my neck, anyway.

15:03.568 --> 15:06.970
And I once, I actually saw him
palm an entire watermelon.

15:08.473 --> 15:12.042
Just one of his many
strange hobbies.

15:12.110 --> 15:13.910
Also, he has very large feet.

15:13.911 --> 15:15.111
Should we
maybe move in

15:15.112 --> 15:17.012
before someone takes a
blowtorch to his face?

15:17.014 --> 15:18.848
No, we still have to wait
for the other guy.

15:18.849 --> 15:22.319
I could use them as-as a kayak,
in case of an emergency.

15:22.387 --> 15:23.587
2012 and all that.

15:23.588 --> 15:25.555
It's okay; Casey's been
through much worse.

15:25.623 --> 15:28.458
His neck was always very,

15:28.526 --> 15:29.626
very thick.

15:29.627 --> 15:31.327
And I was always
very jealous of it,

15:31.328 --> 15:32.462
'cause I think, uh,

15:32.463 --> 15:34.296
in Roman times,
it was a sign of a great warrior

15:34.297 --> 15:35.331
to have a neck like that.

15:35.332 --> 15:36.431
Uh, don't quote me on that.

15:36.432 --> 15:37.499
That's Wikipedia,

15:37.500 --> 15:40.968
so it's probably,
uh, at best, spotty...

15:41.036 --> 15:42.336
Uh, where am I going with this?

15:42.337 --> 15:44.538
Uh, well, maybe a
better question is

15:44.606 --> 15:46.740
where John Casey would
want me to go with this.

15:46.808 --> 15:48.508
They're getting up.
Be ready to move

15:48.509 --> 15:49.676
on my mark.

15:49.677 --> 15:51.544
But, alas, we shall never know,

15:51.545 --> 15:54.012
for he no longer
walketh among the living.

15:57.449 --> 15:58.783
We miss you, J-Case.

15:58.784 --> 15:59.984
That's for sure.

15:59.985 --> 16:02.319
And, uh, please,

16:02.387 --> 16:04.287
come back soon.

16:04.322 --> 16:05.989
In song and limerick.

16:05.990 --> 16:07.657
Is he crying?

16:07.658 --> 16:09.992
I'm done. Good-bye.

16:17.066 --> 16:21.101
Did you really think we'd come
to Casey's funeral unprepared?

16:21.169 --> 16:22.336
You're all under arrest.

16:22.337 --> 16:23.337
Give up now.

16:23.338 --> 16:24.838
We have every exit covered.

16:24.839 --> 16:26.739
I think you missed one.

16:28.542 --> 16:30.442
Boom.

16:40.819 --> 16:42.719
Has anyone got them?

16:43.155 --> 16:45.055
Anyone?

16:54.097 --> 16:56.932
I lost Casey.

17:06.368 --> 17:07.935
I can't believe this.

17:07.935 --> 17:09.970
I got Casey to fake
his own death.

17:10.038 --> 17:11.471
And now he can't defend himself.

17:11.472 --> 17:12.771
This is all my fault.

17:12.772 --> 17:13.973
Call Tactical.
I want a hundred men

17:13.973 --> 17:15.874
locked and loaded,
ready to go on my command.

17:18.010 --> 17:19.109
Did you find him yet?

17:19.111 --> 17:21.011
I'm working on it.

17:21.412 --> 17:23.113
Got it, got it.
Tracker's engaged.

17:23.114 --> 17:24.281
We have a lock
on his location.

17:24.281 --> 17:25.281
Okay, I'll call the strike team.

17:25.281 --> 17:26.882
Please be alive, Casey.

17:26.883 --> 17:28.050
This is Agent Bartowski.

17:28.050 --> 17:29.051
Target needs assistance ASAP.

17:29.052 --> 17:30.852
Move in right now.

17:30.853 --> 17:32.753
Do you copy?

17:32.788 --> 17:34.688
This is Tactical.
We're at the location.

17:34.723 --> 17:36.623
Do you have him?

17:42.695 --> 17:44.629
They put his tracker on a what?

17:44.697 --> 17:45.697
No, God, no!

17:45.698 --> 17:48.733
No, don't shoot it!

17:48.801 --> 17:52.302
They took off his tracker
and put it on a cat.

17:52.370 --> 17:54.203
Then where's Casey?

17:54.204 --> 17:56.905
All right, so we got
to chop his arm off.

17:56.973 --> 17:58.707
It's the left
one, right?

17:58.708 --> 18:00.642
I was planning on
doing it with this.

18:00.710 --> 18:02.477
Not with a knife, no.

18:02.478 --> 18:03.478
Too dull.

18:03.479 --> 18:05.379
What we need
is a surgical saw.

18:05.414 --> 18:06.614
I got one in the other room.

18:06.615 --> 18:07.748
Yeah, you mess up his hand,

18:07.749 --> 18:10.384
you won't be able
to open the vault.

18:14.788 --> 18:16.955

18:21.226 --> 18:23.227
Move, damn it.

Dr. Frankenstein.

18:33.001 --> 18:34.968
Now we're talking.

18:40.608 --> 18:42.978
Like cutting into a bird
on Thanksgiving.

18:48.453 --> 18:50.353
Doorbell. Mackintosh.

18:51.522 --> 18:54.124

come on, come on.

18:55.827 --> 18:57.727

anything I can do?

19:00.967 --> 19:02.601
Anything at all to be useful?

19:02.602 --> 19:05.171
Um, you know, right now, Morgan,
the best thing you can do

19:05.239 --> 19:06.839
is help keep Casey's cover,
all right?

19:06.840 --> 19:08.173
So if anyone
asks about him upstairs,

19:08.174 --> 19:09.307
just say he's on a delivery.

19:09.308 --> 19:11.743
I should get
back upstairs, right?

19:11.811 --> 19:13.813
Yeah.

19:13.881 --> 19:15.015
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:15.016 --> 19:16.149
Sarah, there's got to be

19:16.150 --> 19:18.050
some way to find him.

19:38.506 --> 19:39.806
You had to order a pizza.

19:39.807 --> 19:41.108
What, do you want
to eat pizza

19:41.109 --> 19:42.409
after we cut
the guy's arm off?

19:42.410 --> 19:43.443
I want to eat
pizza now.

19:43.444 --> 19:44.711
Now is the time
to eat pizza.

19:44.712 --> 19:46.612

22:18.885 --> 22:21.085
Can you just get Casey
to my apartment in Echo Park?

22:21.153 --> 22:22.620
There's a key under the mat.

22:22.621 --> 22:23.688
Yeah, nono, no,
we got keys.

22:23.689 --> 22:25.222
What? I...

22:25.223 --> 22:27.123
All right.

22:28.760 --> 22:29.860
What?

22:29.861 --> 22:31.761
Morgan... Morgan,
that is fantastic news.

22:31.762 --> 22:33.662
You stay put.
We'll be right there.

22:34.665 --> 22:36.599
Casey's safe.
He's back at our apartment.

22:36.666 --> 22:38.566
What? What happened?

22:39.502 --> 22:40.735
Oh, my God.

22:40.736 --> 22:42.003
Don't move.

22:42.004 --> 22:44.405
Not moving.

22:48.175 --> 22:50.577
Oh... oh...

22:50.644 --> 22:52.211
Okay, don't move.

22:52.212 --> 22:53.546
Yeah, I heard you
the first time,

22:53.547 --> 22:55.447
and I'm...
and I'm-I'm not moving.

22:57.884 --> 22:59.784
Careful.

23:02.120 --> 23:04.020
Careful, careful, careful.

23:14.731 --> 23:16.364
Uh-oh.

23:16.365 --> 23:19.301
Uh-oh?
You don't say "uh-oh."

23:20.803 --> 23:23.838
You step out of that laser beam,
and this goes off.

23:28.973 --> 23:31.574
Okay, um, I think I can try
and bypass the circuit.

23:31.642 --> 23:33.009
Sarah, I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

23:33.010 --> 23:35.077
What are you talking about?
I was so set

23:35.145 --> 23:37.746
on trying to find my mom that
I let my emotions take over,

23:37.814 --> 23:39.381
and now I've-I've-I've
put everyone

23:39.382 --> 23:40.748
that I care about in danger.

23:40.749 --> 23:42.183
First Casey,
and now you.

23:42.184 --> 23:43.784
Oh, my God, this is complicated.

23:43.785 --> 23:45.686
I can't bear the thought
of you getting hurt

23:45.753 --> 23:48.121
if this thing goes off, so...
I want you to go.

23:48.189 --> 23:49.522
Now, please.

23:49.523 --> 23:50.924
Save yourself.
Okay, you know what?

23:50.925 --> 23:52.158
You could have told me that

23:52.159 --> 23:54.059
before I climbed
under those lasers.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.628
I... when I... I didn't...

23:56.696 --> 23:58.797
Chuck, you're being ridiculous-
come on- even for a man

23:58.865 --> 24:01.433
who is trying to free himself
from high-tech explosives.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.601
Casey and I
know the risks, but,

24:03.669 --> 24:04.969
of course,
we're going to help you.

24:04.970 --> 24:06.137
This is your mom.

24:06.138 --> 24:07.938
I love you. You know that?

24:07.939 --> 24:10.040
And I... and I'd say that
even if you weren't

24:10.107 --> 24:12.007
in the process
of saving my life right now,

24:12.042 --> 24:15.744
which does, by the way, make you
20% to 25% sexier in my book.

24:15.812 --> 24:17.546
All right, 50.

24:17.547 --> 24:19.247
Okay, all right.
Listen, uh,

24:19.248 --> 24:21.282
Chuck and Sarah are going
to be here any minute.

24:21.350 --> 24:23.784
Right? All we got to
do is wait for them.

24:25.087 --> 24:26.987
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

24:28.489 --> 24:30.056
You're blinking a lot.

24:30.057 --> 24:32.392
I hope you know I don't
understand Morse code.

24:33.794 --> 24:35.227
That could be them.

24:35.228 --> 24:37.028
Why would they be knocking?

24:37.029 --> 24:38.363
No.

24:38.364 --> 24:40.231
One minute!

24:40.232 --> 24:42.333
What do I do
with you?

24:44.670 --> 24:46.538
Okay. Okay.

24:46.539 --> 24:48.373
Work with me.

24:48.374 --> 24:50.575
That's a good fit.

24:53.312 --> 24:54.412
Oh. Hi.

24:54.413 --> 24:55.780
Hi, you.
Hi.

24:55.781 --> 24:57.181
What are you
doing here?

24:57.182 --> 24:58.382
Can I come in?

24:58.383 --> 24:59.817
Sorry.

24:59.818 --> 25:02.085
You know what?
I- I had this, uh...

25:02.153 --> 25:03.653
this <i>Halo</i> tourney
last night,

25:03.654 --> 25:06.288
and it just got crazy.

25:06.356 --> 25:08.856
I'm going to come outside and
talk to you, if that's okay.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.224
Yeah. Good, good,
good, good.

25:16.030 --> 25:18.130
Anything I can
do to help?

25:18.198 --> 25:20.165
What, you getting bored
or something?

25:20.233 --> 25:21.600
A little.

25:21.601 --> 25:22.901
Oh, oh.

25:22.902 --> 25:25.036
Suddenly not so bored.

25:25.104 --> 25:26.804
It just powered down.

25:26.805 --> 25:29.005
Okay. Why are you saying that
like it's a bad thing?

25:30.074 --> 25:32.542
Because I didn't disarm it.

25:32.610 --> 25:34.510
I did.

25:36.947 --> 25:39.082
Looks like you're in
a bit of a pickle.

25:39.150 --> 25:41.117
We set that trap
for Casey.

25:42.319 --> 25:44.219
But you two
are almost as good.

25:52.628 --> 25:53.961
So, anyway,
I just came by

25:53.962 --> 25:55.896
to see how it went with my dad.

25:55.964 --> 25:59.766
Well, it didn't, uh...
exactly go.

25:59.833 --> 26:02.568
You know,
it's a little complicated.

26:02.636 --> 26:05.671
I'm confused, Morgan.

26:05.738 --> 26:09.407
You called me to tell me
that you'd talk to my dad,

26:09.475 --> 26:11.676
and now it's
"complicated?"

26:11.744 --> 26:15.413
Do you want to tell me, like,
what's actually going on here?

26:15.481 --> 26:16.915
Mm-hmm.

26:16.916 --> 26:18.448
But...

26:18.449 --> 26:20.684
can you... can you
do me a ge for?

26:20.752 --> 26:21.818
Can we talk about this later?

26:21.819 --> 26:23.387
No.

26:23.388 --> 26:26.289
Right now is the option
I prefer, actually.

26:27.324 --> 26:28.892
Okay. Then...

26:28.893 --> 26:31.227
I'm going to need you to leave.

26:31.295 --> 26:33.363
What?

26:34.933 --> 26:37.535
Are you breaking up with me?

26:38.570 --> 26:40.470
I just need you to go.

26:41.239 --> 26:42.372
Fine.

26:42.373 --> 26:44.273
I get it.

26:45.276 --> 26:47.978
Have fun playing <i>Halo</i>
for the rest of your life.

26:50.982 --> 26:52.882
I'm sorry.

26:57.820 --> 26:59.253
Hey, eulogy guy.

26:59.254 --> 27:00.687
Oh... okay.

27:00.688 --> 27:02.022
I'm looking for Casey.

27:02.023 --> 27:03.923
Uh, Casey who?

27:06.426 --> 27:08.326
That Casey.

27:10.163 --> 27:12.464
I've got a message
for him.

27:12.532 --> 27:14.166
We've got his friends.

27:14.167 --> 27:16.902
We're taking them
on a little gold-digging trip.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.603
Casey knows where.

27:18.604 --> 27:23.073
You tell him he's got
24 hours to show, alone,

27:23.141 --> 27:25.644
or he's going to have
two more funerals to go to.

27:36.888 --> 27:38.721
Morgan.
What's up, hombre?

27:38.722 --> 27:39.822
It's Jeff.

27:39.823 --> 27:41.457
Okay, he-he took too much...

27:41.458 --> 27:42.892
I don't know what.

27:42.893 --> 27:45.595
Now he's come down with...
couch lock?

27:45.663 --> 27:47.163
Ah.

27:47.164 --> 27:48.465
Couch lock.

27:48.466 --> 27:49.799
He overmedicated.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.066
Yes, exactly.
He's overmedicated.

27:51.067 --> 27:53.401
Now, how do I wake him up
from this?

27:53.469 --> 27:54.802
Morgan, do you need me
to come over there?

27:54.803 --> 27:57.604
No. No. No. Man, come...
Awesome, please.

27:57.672 --> 27:59.640
You're busy saving lives.
This is nothing.

27:59.707 --> 28:02.576
This is an average day
for Jeffrey Barnes, okay?

28:02.644 --> 28:04.544
But listen, back to couch lock.

28:04.545 --> 28:06.246
How do I wake him
from this again?

28:06.247 --> 28:07.348
Well, first of all, don't panic.

28:07.349 --> 28:08.516
Jeff is still in there.

28:08.517 --> 28:10.384
Now, just get his heart rate up.

28:10.385 --> 28:12.319
You know, scare him
or get him angry.

28:12.387 --> 28:13.687
If he doesn't wake up,
give me a call.

28:13.688 --> 28:14.921
That's awesome.

28:14.922 --> 28:16.456
Thank you so much, Awe... some.

28:16.457 --> 28:18.657
No. Okay, that's weird.

28:20.926 --> 28:22.927
Okay.

28:22.995 --> 28:25.495
I'm sorry for this, sir,
but it is for your own good.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.132
Ow!

28:29.133 --> 28:31.400
Man, it's like slapping a car.

28:31.468 --> 28:33.202
Okay.

28:33.203 --> 28:34.771
Think, Morgan.
How do I get him angry?

28:34.772 --> 28:36.672
How do I get him...

28:37.708 --> 28:39.975
Oh, crap.

28:42.812 --> 28:44.346
Okay, Casey.

28:44.347 --> 28:45.980
I know you
can hear me,

28:45.981 --> 28:48.983
and I have something
very important to tell you.

28:50.252 --> 28:52.252
I've been dating your daughter.

28:55.456 --> 28:57.124
Yeah. Yeah.

28:57.125 --> 29:00.126
Technically, we're on the rocks
right now, kind of,

29:00.194 --> 29:03.062
but, you know, things
were getting pretty serious.

29:03.130 --> 29:05.164
Hol... holding hands.

29:05.232 --> 29:08.201
And, uh... and the kissing
was just out of control.

29:08.269 --> 29:09.603
But I've been
a perfect gentleman.

29:09.604 --> 29:12.573
I need you to know-
always a perfect gentleman.

29:12.641 --> 29:17.111
Although it definitely
felt like, pretty soon...

29:20.115 --> 29:22.015
...she'd be spending the night.

29:28.823 --> 29:30.723
I will kill you.

29:38.099 --> 29:40.367
Yes! Welcome back, sir.

29:40.435 --> 29:42.169
See? I knew that would work.

29:42.170 --> 29:44.070
Bring it in.
Come on.

29:45.940 --> 29:48.242
Too soon. I see that now.

29:53.363 --> 29:55.231
We're going to
Iran, Morgan.

29:55.232 --> 29:56.765
There's no American
presence there.

29:56.766 --> 29:58.666
We're going
under the radar.

29:59.569 --> 30:02.270
Which means no chance
of anyone rescuing us.

30:02.338 --> 30:04.939
We are the mission-
just you and me.

30:05.007 --> 30:06.674
Right. Yeah, which
is why I think

30:06.675 --> 30:08.909
that we should clear the air,
talk about Alex and me.

30:08.977 --> 30:10.177
You're not getting it, Morgan.

30:10.178 --> 30:11.678
I'm not discussing this with you

30:11.679 --> 30:13.246
because you are not dating
my daughter.

30:13.247 --> 30:14.915
You, Alex-

30:14.916 --> 30:16.850
nothing to see here.

30:16.918 --> 30:18.051
What is your problem, anyway?

30:18.052 --> 30:19.386
Okay? I'm a good guy.

30:19.387 --> 30:20.587
All right?
Not to mention,

30:20.588 --> 30:22.321
stupid me thought me and you
were friends.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.589
<i>Were</i> friends.

30:23.590 --> 30:25.190
Oh, right.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.659
Or-or maybe it's that you don't
have any friends.

30:27.727 --> 30:29.027
Okay, I happened to
notice at your funeral,

30:29.028 --> 30:30.195
the only people
who showed up

30:30.196 --> 30:32.196
wanted to see you dead.

30:33.932 --> 30:35.265
Okay.

30:35.266 --> 30:37.166
Sorry about that one.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.869
That was probably
not my place.

30:38.870 --> 30:40.303
If you'd like
to choke me now,

30:40.304 --> 30:42.305
that's fine, or we could wait
for the plane ride.

30:42.373 --> 30:43.673
It's a 19-hour flight to Iran.

30:43.674 --> 30:45.708
Bring a book. We ain't talking.

30:56.186 --> 30:58.521
So you guys are pretty
much going to kill us

30:58.589 --> 31:00.122
no matter what
Casey does, right?

31:00.123 --> 31:01.290
Yep.

31:01.291 --> 31:02.859
Mind if I ask you a
few questions, then?

31:02.860 --> 31:04.760
Sure.

31:04.762 --> 31:07.564
I assume you've dealt with
many of Volkoff's prisoners.

31:07.631 --> 31:10.333
Did you ever come
across one named Frost?

31:13.604 --> 31:15.271
Frost isn't a prisoner.

31:15.272 --> 31:17.172
She's our boss.

31:32.255 --> 31:34.222
I'll set the computer,
all right?

31:34.289 --> 31:37.059
Okay.

31:37.126 --> 31:39.994
Now, they're down there;
we're up here.

31:40.062 --> 31:41.962
Now what?

31:43.731 --> 31:45.431
We got water,

31:45.432 --> 31:47.066
Yeah.
sewer, electronics,

31:47.067 --> 31:49.002
security camera.

31:49.070 --> 31:52.406
Guts of the bunker.
We'll tap in right here.

31:55.309 --> 31:57.011
We can control the bunker
from here.

31:57.012 --> 31:58.345
This will give us
the upper hand.

31:58.346 --> 31:59.345
Shift-eight?

31:59.346 --> 32:00.847
Six, six, six, six.

32:00.848 --> 32:02.915
I got... I got it.
I got it.

32:02.983 --> 32:05.050
Ugh. There they are.

32:05.118 --> 32:09.554
So, uh, Frost-
she a tough boss?

32:09.622 --> 32:12.089
She's Volkoff's right hand.

32:12.157 --> 32:15.225
When he has a problem,
he sends in Frost,

32:15.293 --> 32:17.261
and that problem
disappears.

32:19.797 --> 32:21.230
Sarah, I'm kind of
starting to think

32:21.231 --> 32:23.332
that my mom might be one
of the bad guys.

32:28.536 --> 32:29.703
Here, put these on.

32:29.704 --> 32:30.871
Oh, it's so hot.
Put them on.

32:30.872 --> 32:32.205
Do I really
have to wear these, really?

32:32.206 --> 32:34.106
Only if you don't want
to get electrocuted.

32:35.677 --> 32:38.278
They actually breathe
surprisingly well.

32:38.346 --> 32:40.213
Sorry, yeah.
Wait for my signal.

32:40.214 --> 32:41.548
When you hear
the word "security,"

32:41.549 --> 32:43.950
you hit this switch,
knock out the lights.

32:44.017 --> 32:45.017
Got it?

32:45.018 --> 32:46.285
Absolutely. "Security."

32:46.286 --> 32:48.053
Hit the switch.
No, no, no!

32:48.054 --> 32:49.688
The word "security,"
wait for it.

32:49.689 --> 32:51.122
Just testing you.

32:51.123 --> 32:52.724
Wait a minute,
turn off the lights?

32:52.725 --> 32:54.291
It's three-to-one
down there, Casey.

32:54.292 --> 32:56.293
Just the way I like it.

32:58.964 --> 33:00.097
Heads up.

33:00.098 --> 33:01.998
We got company.

33:10.473 --> 33:11.839
That's how it is, huh?

33:11.840 --> 33:13.474
You can't get to me
for 11 years,

33:13.475 --> 33:15.676
so you come up with the idea
of kidnappinthese two?

33:15.744 --> 33:17.544
If you hadn't been
such a hard-ass, Casey,

33:17.545 --> 33:19.212
we wouldn't all
be here right now.

33:19.213 --> 33:20.546
We'd be on a beach

33:20.547 --> 33:22.681
earning 20%.

33:22.749 --> 33:24.649
Unless we invested
in real estate.

33:24.650 --> 33:26.550
Now drop your
weapon, Casey.

33:32.161 --> 33:34.061
All your weapons, Casey.

33:45.606 --> 33:47.540
I would've
come unarmed,

33:47.607 --> 33:49.876
but I wasn't sure what kind of
security I'd run into.

33:49.944 --> 33:51.844
That's the signal.

33:54.581 --> 33:56.481
What?!

33:58.018 --> 33:59.385
Damn it.

33:59.386 --> 34:01.220
I said, I would've come unarmed,
but I wasn't sure

34:01.221 --> 34:02.622
what kind of <i>security</i>
I'd run into.

34:02.623 --> 34:03.723
Yeah, we heard you
the first time.

34:03.724 --> 34:05.825
We're right here, pal.

34:08.862 --> 34:10.762
What the hell's
going on?

34:14.801 --> 34:15.868
Grimes.

34:15.869 --> 34:16.969
Sorry, sorry. One second.

34:16.969 --> 34:17.969
One second.

34:17.969 --> 34:20.071
Okay.

34:20.139 --> 34:22.039
Let there be darkness.

34:23.875 --> 34:25.775
Oh, oh, oh!
What the...?

34:26.645 --> 34:28.080
Don't worry about it.

34:28.081 --> 34:30.016
Get the gold.
Let's get the gold.

34:30.083 --> 34:31.983
Any more surprises, Colonel?

34:42.161 --> 34:44.062
Holy Goldfinger.

34:44.831 --> 34:46.831
Topside there are 15
of the most hardcore

34:46.900 --> 34:48.933
Special Forces soldiers
you've ever seen.

34:49.001 --> 34:50.900
Come on, come on.

34:51.904 --> 34:53.337
They got 10,000
rounds of ammo,

34:53.338 --> 34:56.840
a squadron of F-15 fighters
a radio call away.

34:56.908 --> 34:58.808
Your move.

34:59.610 --> 35:02.378
Well, maybe
I'll get lucky.

35:04.347 --> 35:07.049
Ow!

35:08.084 --> 35:09.451
Is that a little girl?

35:09.452 --> 35:11.352
That really stings!

35:13.455 --> 35:14.989
Whoever you are,

35:14.990 --> 35:16.791
we have Casey and the others.

35:16.792 --> 35:19.894
Surrender or we will kill them.

35:21.263 --> 35:22.496
So you got lucky, you hit one.

35:22.497 --> 35:23.831
Still 14 left.

35:23.832 --> 35:25.733
And they'll never surr-
I surrender!

35:26.935 --> 35:28.368
I'm still
surrendering.

35:28.369 --> 35:29.836
Please do not shoot me.

35:29.837 --> 35:31.338
I'm out, just me all alone.

35:31.339 --> 35:33.239
No one else knows we're here.

35:33.942 --> 35:35.843
So much for your Special Forces.

35:37.879 --> 35:39.613
You move and you're dead.

35:39.614 --> 35:41.514
Let's get the gold.

35:44.348 --> 35:46.281
Casey, couch lock.

35:47.382 --> 35:48.615
What?

35:48.616 --> 35:50.516
The cable.

35:54.288 --> 35:56.789
Oh, good Lord.

35:56.856 --> 35:58.390
Lift your feet up.

35:58.391 --> 35:59.625
Do it, do it now.

35:59.626 --> 36:00.859
He's gonna try and shock them.

36:00.860 --> 36:02.494
Morgan!

36:02.495 --> 36:04.395
Morgan, no!

36:20.744 --> 36:22.812
Morgan.

36:22.879 --> 36:25.047
Morgan, can you hear me?

36:25.115 --> 36:27.015
Wake up, moron.

36:33.724 --> 36:35.224
What happened?

36:35.225 --> 36:36.725
What hap-
What happened?

36:36.726 --> 36:38.726
You just took 10,000
volts is what happened.

36:38.794 --> 36:39.992
You went into cardiac arrest

36:39.993 --> 36:41.893
and we actually lost you
for a moment there.

36:41.928 --> 36:44.095
You lost me?
You lost me?

36:44.163 --> 36:46.097
You mean,
I, uh, I died?

36:46.165 --> 36:48.065
Yeah, for, like,
three seconds.

36:48.066 --> 36:49.767
What about the bad guys?

36:49.768 --> 36:51.568
Oh, they're alive,
a little crispy.

36:51.569 --> 36:53.236
Buddy, that was
the single bravest thing

36:53.237 --> 36:55.137
I've ever seen anyone do.

36:56.607 --> 36:57.606
Don't ever do it again.

36:57.607 --> 37:00.475
No. No.

37:00.543 --> 37:02.377
Can we go home now?
Yeah.

37:02.378 --> 37:03.445
On your fe.

37:03.446 --> 37:05.346
What? Okay.

37:16.786 --> 37:18.853
Um, Casey.

37:18.921 --> 37:21.188
Now that we know
that you're

37:21.256 --> 37:25.088
"cool," you should know
that we do "installs" like that

37:25.156 --> 37:27.423
twice a week.

37:27.491 --> 37:29.559
Count yourself in.

37:32.496 --> 37:35.231
We wake up in some of
the best Dumpsters in the city.

37:38.869 --> 37:40.237
Hey.

37:40.238 --> 37:42.339
Hmm?

37:42.407 --> 37:46.143
Just want to make sure
that we're, uh, we're good.

37:48.212 --> 37:50.414
Oh, good, good.

37:50.481 --> 37:53.050
Uh, also, you don't have to
worry about Alex and me.

37:53.118 --> 37:55.452
We're pretty
much over.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.821
I can tell
you're heartbroken over it.

37:57.889 --> 38:02.059
So... I'd also
just like to give you this.

38:02.127 --> 38:04.127
What is it?

38:04.195 --> 38:05.228
It's an invite.

38:05.229 --> 38:07.631
To my party.

38:07.699 --> 38:10.067
You know, being dead for three
seconds made me miss my friends.

38:10.135 --> 38:13.070
So, you know,
just think of it

38:13.138 --> 38:14.538
as people who'd
actually be there.

38:14.539 --> 38:17.106
If there was ever
a real funeral.

38:17.174 --> 38:19.609
♪ ♪

38:21.712 --> 38:23.712
You should come.

38:42.665 --> 38:44.565
Hey, buddy.

38:46.002 --> 38:47.569
Hey.

38:47.570 --> 38:49.504
Hi.

38:49.572 --> 38:50.939
You look great,
you guys.

38:50.940 --> 38:53.408
Beautiful.

38:53.476 --> 38:55.376
Let me get you a beer.

39:00.014 --> 39:01.447
Alex.

39:01.448 --> 39:02.782
I didn't know you were coming.

39:02.783 --> 39:04.517
Please, come in.

39:04.518 --> 39:06.418
This is good.

39:06.553 --> 39:08.420
You look lovely.

39:08.421 --> 39:10.955
Uh, so, look,

39:11.023 --> 39:13.157
I'm really sorry I said
some stupid things

39:13.225 --> 39:14.225
the other day and, uh...

39:14.226 --> 39:15.427
I already talked
to my dad, Morgan.

39:15.428 --> 39:16.428
I know what happened.

39:16.429 --> 39:19.531
He said
that you dumped me

39:19.599 --> 39:21.499
because he told you
you had to.

39:23.137 --> 39:27.540
He also said
that you stood up to him

39:27.608 --> 39:29.475
and changed his mind,

39:29.476 --> 39:32.411
which could not have been easy.

39:32.479 --> 39:35.748
So maybe I was wrong about you.

39:35.816 --> 39:37.716
You are brave.

39:39.152 --> 39:42.788
Look, Alex, you know that
I'm really sorry about all that.

39:42.855 --> 39:45.758
And, uh, this may come
as a surprise,

39:45.825 --> 39:47.626
but I don't care
what your dad thinks.

39:47.627 --> 39:49.461
Really. I like you.

39:49.462 --> 39:51.330
And I want to be with you.

39:51.331 --> 39:53.231
If you want to be with me.

39:54.535 --> 39:56.335
You do, right?

39:56.336 --> 39:57.436
That's- you
almost said no.

39:57.437 --> 39:58.971
Of course I do.

39:58.972 --> 40:00.906
That's good for the confidence.
Come on, let's get a drink.

40:04.077 --> 40:06.911
All right.

40:11.616 --> 40:13.551
Alex is here.

40:13.618 --> 40:16.587
Mm.

40:20.693 --> 40:22.526
Okay.

40:22.527 --> 40:24.194
She looks beautiful, huh?

40:24.195 --> 40:26.429
Casey...

40:26.497 --> 40:28.564
thank you.

40:28.632 --> 40:30.532
Mm.

40:30.868 --> 40:32.936
Hey...

40:33.004 --> 40:36.706
you break her heart,
I break your everything.

40:44.548 --> 40:46.749
There you are.

40:46.817 --> 40:49.085
Ishis the part
where I'm supposed to ask you

40:49.152 --> 40:52.456
what you're thinking about?

40:55.159 --> 40:57.727
My mom.

40:57.795 --> 40:59.229
I thought she
was a prisoner

40:59.230 --> 41:01.364
who needed
to be saved.

41:01.432 --> 41:04.501
And... and I
come to fi out

41:04.569 --> 41:06.403
she's just one
of the bad guys.

41:06.404 --> 41:08.004
Chuck, we don't know
what side your mom is on.

41:08.005 --> 41:09.905
Maybe not.

41:11.641 --> 41:15.176
But there's one
thing I do know:

41:15.244 --> 41:19.948
In order to find the one
person who... left me,

41:20.015 --> 41:22.820
I've endangered the
lives of everyone

41:22.888 --> 41:26.490
who would never leave me:
Morgan, Casey, you.

41:28.059 --> 41:30.961
I'm going to stop
looking for my mom.

41:31.029 --> 41:32.496
Oh, Chuck...

41:32.497 --> 41:33.764
No, it's okay.

41:33.765 --> 41:36.200
I thought I had to bring
my family back together,

41:36.267 --> 41:38.167
but I don't.

41:39.770 --> 41:42.472
You guys,
Awesome, Ellie-

41:42.540 --> 41:44.440
you're my family.

41:46.410 --> 41:50.446
I love you.

41:52.083 --> 41:53.116
I'll see you inside.

41:53.117 --> 41:55.017
Yeah.

42:08.332 --> 42:09.498
Hello.

42:09.499 --> 42:10.866
Hello, Chuck.

42:10.867 --> 42:12.668
It's your mother.
