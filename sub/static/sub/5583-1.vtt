00:13.414 --> 00:16.417
ANIKA: Don't do this...
LUCIOUS: Andre, put your heart
into this company.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.452
ANDRE: Which makes me
the most qualified to run
the company, Dad.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.156
We got to call the police.
No, no, no-- babe, I'm pregnant.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.158
LUCIOUS: Your sexuality--
that's a choice.

00:24.192 --> 00:27.161
Do you want Empire or don't you?

00:27.195 --> 00:29.330
I need to know that
you got that monster

00:29.363 --> 00:31.665

what he has to do.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.535
JAMAL:
The songs that I'm writing
will only further prove that

00:34.568 --> 00:36.170
I'm you, but on steroids.

00:36.204 --> 00:38.172
LUCIOUS:
The empire is yours, Jamal.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.940
CARTER: For 17 years,
you kept your mouth shut

00:39.973 --> 00:41.442
about what Frank Gathers did.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.677
Help us make sure

00:46.247 --> 00:49.183

ANIKA: They call him
"Tricky" Trichter

00:49.217 --> 00:51.252
'cause he's the best
at hostile takeovers.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.521
HAKEEM:
We got to stick together
if we gonna do this.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.190
LUCIOUS: Sometimes you gotta
be willing to sacrifice
your queen.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.192
JAMAL: You made a deal-- you let
her back in the company.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.561

mother tried to murder me.

COOKIE: Jamal, that's not
what it looks like.

01:02.130 --> 01:04.031
Lucious Lyon,
you're under arrest

01:04.064 --> 01:05.566
for the murder of
Bunkie Williams.

01:05.599 --> 01:06.767
You did this to me?

01:06.800 --> 01:08.035
No, I swear!

being held
under mass incarceration

01:28.822 --> 01:32.826
in America's prison system
today, right now.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.829
Just like my brother Lucious
Lyon has been for three months,

01:35.863 --> 01:38.499
(crowd clamoring)
held without bail.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.767
Free Lucious!

01:39.800 --> 01:41.435
What you say?
ALL: Free Lucious!

01:47.875 --> 01:49.643
Shut up!

01:49.677 --> 01:52.280
You're just mad 'cause
he chose Jamal over you.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.348
That's not why.

01:54.382 --> 01:57.351
Mom, you got us here doing
a "Free Lucious" concert

01:57.385 --> 01:59.353
when we should be performing
for the brothers and sisters

01:59.387 --> 02:00.688

02:00.721 --> 02:02.990
You think I don't
know that, stupid?

02:03.023 --> 02:06.494
This is about
us taking the Empire.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.796
Stay focused.
Jamal not gonna like us

02:08.829 --> 02:10.364
doing this
hostile takeover.

02:10.398 --> 02:11.699
He's gonna think
it's us against them.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.434
Jamal will understand.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.902
I am doing this for y'all.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.938
Look...

02:17.971 --> 02:19.507
you're right.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.875
Your father is a tampon.

02:21.909 --> 02:25.346
He is a egomaniac.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.381
But today is all
about impressing

02:27.415 --> 02:28.382
that investor lady
Mimi Whiteman.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.050
Now, come on, boy,

02:30.083 --> 02:35.122

You see this crowd out here?
Yeah, I see the crowd.

02:39.427 --> 02:41.295
They gonna have to give Dad
a new bail hearing after this.

02:41.329 --> 02:42.463
Bill Clinton is out there.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.697
Yeah, he needs to be,

02:43.731 --> 02:45.566

to get elected.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.401
Look, what you want, boy?
I got stuff to do.

02:47.435 --> 02:50.571
I just felt...
felt bad and stupid

02:50.604 --> 02:52.373
for thinking that you could
ever sell Dad out.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.874
I ain't no snitch.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.843
You need to go
visit that man.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.845

to tell him that

02:57.878 --> 02:59.613

03:00.848 --> 03:02.216
All right, Ma.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.787
FEMALE STAGEHAND: Mrs. Lyon,

Hah!

How much longer?

03:56.270 --> 03:57.571
How much longer

03:57.605 --> 03:59.740
are they gonna
treat us like animals?

04:02.276 --> 04:06.246
The American correctional
system is built

04:06.280 --> 04:07.581
on the backs of our brothers,

04:07.615 --> 04:11.385
our fathers, and our sons.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.120
How much longer?

04:13.153 --> 04:17.925
It is a system that must be
dismantled, piece by piece,

04:17.958 --> 04:20.428
if we are to live up
to those words

04:20.461 --> 04:23.230
that we recite with our hands
on our hearts--

04:23.263 --> 04:25.566
justice for all.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.435
Not justice for some.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.670
(crowd clamoring)
But justice for all!

04:29.703 --> 04:31.939
How much longer? Say it!

Uh, I don't know yet.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.341

Okay. Tell him

05:10.177 --> 05:12.813
* I got my hands in the air--
Officer, don't shoot *
* Whoo! *

05:12.846 --> 05:15.349

* That's word *

05:15.383 --> 05:18.051

but never gave me the loot *
* Boss! *

05:18.085 --> 05:20.488
* They got my back to the wall

05:20.521 --> 05:22.723
I loved it, Cookie.
I really loved it.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.659
Mass incarceration is
such an important issue.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.161
I love you, Reverend
Al Sharpton.
Love you. Love you.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.698

Lucious? Word in the street

05:30.731 --> 05:31.999

He's not right...
Thanks for coming, Al.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.205

Tom Ford.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.177
Gucci.

05:44.211 --> 05:45.212
Last season.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.883
And you said Anna Wintour
was coming.
Shut up.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.152
* Took a couple of L's,
they say a try is a fail *

05:52.185 --> 05:54.988
* It's either put on a mask
or throw the work on the scale *

05:55.022 --> 05:57.090
* Times done changed,
but I can't even tell *

05:57.124 --> 05:59.660
* It's only two ways to go, it's
gon' be freedom or jail... *

05:59.693 --> 06:01.429
Cookie?
Uh, hold on.
Excuse you.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.531
I want an interview with Cookie.
No, I'm not feeling what

06:03.564 --> 06:05.499
you did out there in Peterson,
so the short answer is no.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.267
Peterson? What are you
talking about?
It's Ferguson, brain-dead.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.670
I got this-- Don, I'm-a take
care of you, but I have to look

06:09.703 --> 06:11.371

Thank you, Cookie.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.606
And you did good in
Ferguson, brother.
Thank you.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.041
He did all right.
Yes, you did good.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.876
But he did mess up
that "N" word with...

06:15.909 --> 06:17.778
* They gave Lucious a case,
and he couldn't even bail *

06:17.811 --> 06:20.681
* Judge gave him a option,
go to trial or tell *

06:20.714 --> 06:23.250
* Now he sittin' in prison,
while the governor fishin' *

06:23.283 --> 06:25.118

* You put a cat in a corner, he

06:27.821 --> 06:30.691

06:32.893 --> 06:35.429
* I had a dream in my head,
I gotta break outta prison *

06:35.463 --> 06:37.431

06:49.743 --> 06:51.879

06:51.912 --> 06:53.380

06:53.413 --> 06:55.716

06:55.749 --> 06:59.653

* Let's do it! *

06:59.687 --> 07:02.456

07:02.490 --> 07:03.591

Oh-oh *

07:03.624 --> 07:05.626

07:09.697 --> 07:11.932
* Do you believe
in the Creator? *
* Yes! *

07:11.965 --> 07:14.835
* Do you even know anymore?
* Yeah! *

07:14.868 --> 07:16.670
* It's like you make it

07:16.704 --> 07:19.507
* Then they take it and
you can't get it back, oh-oh! *

07:19.540 --> 07:23.276

Oh-oh... *

08:10.591 --> 08:12.192
So? I ain't got no
beef with Gathers.

No, but something went down,

'cause Cookie-- she...
Look, wrong name, brother.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.733
Gathers might come after me
because of Cookie.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.334
Look, whatever problem

08:21.368 --> 08:22.870

I'm praying for what I need *

08:36.183 --> 08:37.685
* So whatever's in that dark is

08:37.718 --> 08:39.219

08:39.252 --> 08:41.188
* Two wrongs ain't never
made it no right *

08:41.221 --> 08:43.023
* Try to test my strength and
I fought with all my might *

08:43.056 --> 08:45.926

just to reconcile my life *

08:45.959 --> 08:47.360

Hey.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.374

09:01.408 --> 09:03.243

09:03.276 --> 09:06.079
Call me Mimi.
And I love your drag, Mimi.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.015
It's screaming,
"I'm dripping with money,"

09:08.048 --> 09:10.618

to spend it.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.086

Don't you "Easy, Mom" me, boy.

The reason we're here.

09:40.814 --> 09:44.317
I hope that's not the only
reason why you're here, Mimi.

09:44.351 --> 09:48.221
You in that dress, Cookie?

09:48.255 --> 09:52.025
I can think of all
kinds of reasons.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.930
CROWD: Free Lucious!
Free Lucious! Free Lucious!

09:56.964 --> 10:01.101
Free Lucious! Free Lucious!
Free Lucious!

10:01.134 --> 10:03.370
(whispering inaudibly)
Free Lucious! Free Lucious!

10:11.945 --> 10:12.846
(indistinct conversations)

10:12.880 --> 10:15.448
(grunting with effort)

10:24.324 --> 10:27.695
You see that?
They bringing in Frank Gathers.

10:46.379 --> 10:49.316
Nobody touches
Frank Gathers.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.822
(quietly):
Yeah.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.659
(indistinct conversations)

11:14.341 --> 11:18.011
What you trying to do,
scare somebody?

11:18.045 --> 11:19.813
Lucious Lyon.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.548
Seems like yesterday

11:21.581 --> 11:24.251
you were moving biscuits for me
at 50 a pop.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.219
He used to work for me.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.721
Him and his old lady.

11:27.755 --> 11:31.058
Yeah,
that was 20 years ago, fool.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.829
(laughing)

11:35.863 --> 11:38.265
How's Cookie?

11:38.298 --> 11:41.034
Hell if I know.
You talk to her?

11:41.068 --> 11:42.870
Not since before
she got locked up.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.907
You look good.
It's nice seeing you.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.742
You, too.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.510
You know, we inspirational
figures, you and me.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.745
No, no, no, you
the inspiration.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.513
You inspire fear.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.548
That's how you win
on the streets.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.284
Hell yeah.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.387
You be safe.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.260
COOKIE: 50 Cent's still
taking jabs at us.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.696
Look what he put on
the gram, thirsty ass.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.299
Ooh, Krispy Kreme!

12:12.332 --> 12:13.700
No! No!

12:13.733 --> 12:15.535
Didn't you say
you was on a diet, Mom?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.204
Give me my phone, boy.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.772
Why you got these here?

12:18.806 --> 12:21.208
I'm going to check
on Tiana,

12:21.241 --> 12:23.143
and then I'm coming
to your session to check on you.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.146
Mm-hmm.
And you better not be smoking
weed, Hakeem, I mean it.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.314
Hey, Ma.
All right.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.315
Look, I need for you

12:28.348 --> 12:30.217
to cover me tonight

12:30.250 --> 12:31.384
with, uh, Derek at
the studio, all right?
HAKEEM: Jamal?

12:31.418 --> 12:32.752
You serious?
Hold on a second.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.421
Yeah. Do I look
like I'm not?
Uh-uh...

12:34.454 --> 12:35.823
Jamal?
Hold on!

12:35.856 --> 12:37.825
Marco's gonna
be fur...
Jamal!

12:37.858 --> 12:41.394
Shut up.
Excuse us. Excuse us.
Marco's gonna be furious.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.396
He's been trying to
sign Derek for months.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.565
I couldn't care less. You have
a ten times better ear than him.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.733
Hakeem, I looked
at the, um... the artwork

12:46.766 --> 12:48.335
for the cover of your album.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.403
And?
I don't like it.
It's amateurish.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.305
You just don't get it,
do you?

12:52.339 --> 12:53.606
What the hell
is wrong with you?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.308
I'm telling Mom. Mom?

12:55.342 --> 12:56.776
Trying to help him out.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.445
You're rude, he's crude,

12:58.478 --> 12:59.612
and the both of y'all are
socially unacceptable.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.148
You need to fix this.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.682
No, he needs to fix it.

13:02.715 --> 13:05.185
Give me a meeting with him
after this meeting.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.254
Uh, you have
a marketing meeting.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.256
Well, after the
marketing meeting.
ANDRE: Don't forget we have

13:09.289 --> 13:10.657
a BOD phone call at 11:30,

13:10.690 --> 13:13.193
and then lunch
with the Apex Radio guys.

13:13.226 --> 13:16.163
(sighs)
This don't stop.
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.931
I'm just trying
to get into the studio, Andre.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.566
Of course you are.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.103
Set a meeting
with Hakeem after lunch.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.771
After lunch,
you're seeing your father.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.173
Figure it out, little boy.
Yes, sir.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.511
You get a chance to...
see the concert?

13:31.544 --> 13:33.680
Have you written any new songs?

13:33.713 --> 13:35.883
No.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.818
Running your Empire's
taking up all my time.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.720
Yeah.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.891
My album dropped to number 22
on the charts, Dad.
I know.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.792
It's because I'm supposed
to be touring by now.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.027
Look, get me the
hell out of here,

13:47.060 --> 13:48.395
and you can tour the world.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.030
Lawyers say
that your bail hearing's

13:50.063 --> 13:51.831
gonna go in your favor.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.401
Well, anybody seen that
lying snake Vernon?
Shh.

13:54.434 --> 13:59.439
No. He needs
to be... handled.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.110
Not yet.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.516
All right. So how's Andre
doing with Apex Radio?

14:09.549 --> 14:12.019
Good. We had a good lunch today.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.587
No. No, I need him
to close that deal.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.656
All right.
Did you talk

14:16.689 --> 14:18.558
to Hakeem about the artwork?

14:18.591 --> 14:19.826
Mm-hmm, he's pissed.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.528
Well, he'll get
over it, man.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.696
He hasn't recorded his
new track yet, has he?

14:23.730 --> 14:26.433
No, Cookie's trying,
but he's unfocused or whatever.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.402
'Cause Cookie
can't manage him.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.672
I'm the only person
that can manage him.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.409
You know your mama
ain't even seen me.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.478
Not once.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.550
Okay. Payback for the past.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.452
I get it.

14:46.886 --> 14:52.559
Who was that... lesbian bitch

14:52.592 --> 14:54.894
in the red suit?

14:54.928 --> 14:57.430
Who?
At the concert.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.699
That was cuddled up
with your mama.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.935
I don't know who you're
talking about... at the...?

15:05.438 --> 15:07.607
Find out who she is.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.413
Her and your mama
are up to something.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.454
(groans)

15:21.488 --> 15:23.323
Dig.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.492
(gasps)

15:25.525 --> 15:27.327
They know.

15:31.698 --> 15:35.402
If we were suspects, we would've
been hauled in already.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.637
Then they're stalling.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.440
You think
he was their only witness?

15:40.473 --> 15:42.642
Yes, I do.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.945
And you know if they don't find
any evidence against Lucious,

15:45.979 --> 15:49.749
they're going to throw his case
out sooner rather than later.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.518
We need
this hostile takeover thing done

15:51.551 --> 15:53.120
before he gets out,

15:53.153 --> 15:54.787
or it'll never happen.
It's okay.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.956
Baby, it's gonna
happen, okay?
All right.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.159
It looks like
Mimi Whiteman is gonna bite.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.860
(sighs)

16:02.562 --> 16:04.631
You haven't told your pastor,
have you?

16:04.664 --> 16:06.433
Told him about what?

16:06.466 --> 16:07.700
About Vernon.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.269
Why you asking me that?
What do you mean,

16:09.302 --> 16:11.238
why am I asking you that?

16:12.739 --> 16:15.008
No.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.812
(sighs)

16:19.846 --> 16:22.049
Babe.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.617
You need to relax.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.219
Okay?

16:26.253 --> 16:28.155
This deal is gonna go through,

16:28.188 --> 16:30.190
and this company is
gonna be yours.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.824
(sighs)

16:31.858 --> 16:33.893
There's no way anyone
in their right mind

16:33.926 --> 16:36.029
would leave a half
a billion dollar investment

16:36.063 --> 16:38.665
to Cookie and Hakeem.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.703
I still can't believe
he gave it to Jamal.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.773
I know.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.078
How's my boy?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.748
He's tired.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.695
(fingers snap)

17:12.965 --> 17:16.603
(TV playing indistinctly)

17:16.636 --> 17:19.206
I heard you got five years
for armed robbery, Jermel.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.974
Yeah, well, I ain't do it.

17:24.911 --> 17:28.615
Just like you didn't kill
my boy Teddy McNally?

17:28.648 --> 17:30.717
Smell the roses!

17:32.252 --> 17:35.755
No.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.924
I know you did it.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.293
No fight, man.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.262
I wouldn't do that
on my mama, man.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.796
Ain't do that.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.376
I'm hungry.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.944
You hungry?

18:00.580 --> 18:01.981
* Look at the flicka da wrist

18:02.014 --> 18:04.083
* Look at
the flicka da wrist *

18:04.117 --> 18:06.553
* That wrist *
* Look at the flicka
da wrist *

18:06.586 --> 18:08.821
* That wrist *
* Look at the flicka da wrist

18:08.855 --> 18:10.557
* Look at the flicka
da wrist... *

18:10.590 --> 18:12.659
So, how do you like

18:12.692 --> 18:14.894
this little party we
put together for you?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.996
Just wanted to welcome
you into the family.

18:17.029 --> 18:19.766
Very enterprising
of you, Cookie.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.768
Speaking of
enterprising, Mimi,

18:21.801 --> 18:23.270
Empire still runs
a hip-hop circuit.

18:23.303 --> 18:27.740
Music, fashion,
liquor, sports.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.975
What is she doing here?

18:29.008 --> 18:30.310
She's in my house.
Oh, really?

18:30.343 --> 18:31.911
If I'm here, she here.
Oh, what's...?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.780
Okay.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.949
ANDRE:
We're trying to bring in
$250 million tonight.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.251
We need her,
or I can't get these people,

18:38.285 --> 18:39.819
I can't get this money.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.120
Please do it
for us, okay?

18:41.154 --> 18:43.423
ANIKA:
Heard a lot about you, Mimi.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.924
Tell me what
you've heard.
Well... (laughs)

18:44.957 --> 18:45.925
Who'd you hear it from?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.760
(laughs)

18:47.794 --> 18:50.597
Oh, look at that. I like this
little beauty mark right there.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.764
(Mimi laughs)
ANIKA:
Do I have one there?

18:51.798 --> 18:53.099
Welcome home, Mimi.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.634
Look, these dudes
from Atlanta think

18:54.667 --> 18:56.503
they giving us a run
for our money.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.138
But you know your boy Keem got
some hooks into those cats.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.673
Here you go, baby.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.108
Ooh! Do you?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.811
We have our eye
on the future, Mimi.
Yes.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.146
We're making a big
streaming play.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.849
It's gonna go global.
I hear Lil Wayne
may be a free agent soon.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.852
Oh, yeah? So, who do you got in
the streets in your ear, Mimi?

19:14.721 --> 19:16.956
Don't you worry your pretty
little weave about that, Cookie.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.625
(laughter)

19:18.658 --> 19:20.960
No, what I'd really like
to know is,

19:20.993 --> 19:23.296
why do you want
to depose Lucious?

19:23.330 --> 19:26.999
He's lost his way, and I
need to get my company back

19:27.033 --> 19:30.803
before he destroys it,
or destroys my family.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.706
Mm-hmm.
I'm saving it
for my sons.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.842
Oh.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.076
For my babies.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.312
So it's for the children?

19:39.346 --> 19:41.814
Yes. For the children.
Okay.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.716
* Catchin' plays
And the pretty babies.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.884
* Catchin' plays

19:44.917 --> 19:47.053
* Oh

19:48.955 --> 19:50.823
* I woke up feelin' like

19:50.857 --> 19:52.392
* I was on the moon...
* On the moon! *

19:52.425 --> 19:53.493
(classical music playing)

19:53.526 --> 19:54.527
MICHAEL:
Nothing, thank you.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.898
Get rid of Ricardo.

20:01.268 --> 20:04.203
Tell him to get out of here.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.873
(speaking Spanish)

20:06.906 --> 20:08.875
Si.
Gracias.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.244
Why you gotta be so nasty?

20:17.116 --> 20:19.286
(sighs)

20:32.299 --> 20:33.933
(sighs)

20:33.966 --> 20:35.134
Empire.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.971
So...

20:40.440 --> 20:41.941
You like it?

20:45.144 --> 20:47.280
(sighs)

20:47.314 --> 20:49.282
You know what turns me on?

20:49.316 --> 20:50.417
Yes?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.485
You're blowing up, baby.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.487
Ten weeks
on the Billboard charts.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.423
That's impressive, Jamal.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.293
You know what turns me on?

21:00.327 --> 21:02.061
What?

21:02.094 --> 21:03.396
You.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.265
Putting together
this whole LGBT party.

21:06.299 --> 21:07.400
It's good for you.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.968
You made me look good.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.037
You always look good.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.807
So you are going to make it
to the meeting tomorrow.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.275
Right?

21:16.309 --> 21:18.110
(sighs)

21:20.112 --> 21:21.914
Yeah, I'm gonna figure it out.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.483
Well, we can have the meeting
at your office.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.920
I miss you so much.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.856
What about Ryan?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.324
Ryan is a ho.

21:31.358 --> 21:33.259
Yes, he is a ho.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.495
I made a mistake.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.935
You still want me, though.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.804
(man trilling)

21:44.837 --> 21:46.639
* Jahlil Beats, holla at me
* Ah... *

21:46.673 --> 21:49.108
* And Chewy I'm some hot boy
* Hot *

21:49.141 --> 21:52.979
* Like I talked to Shyste
when I ... boys *
HAKEEM: Okay. There you go.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.782
* Like you seen them twirl
then he drop boy *
You're pretty.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.617
How you doing?
Good.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.985
Oh, let me see.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.319
I like this little tie.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.054
Thank you.
Here, you want to try...?

22:02.088 --> 22:05.024
You're trying too hard. Move.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.026
ANIKA:
What did I miss?

22:07.059 --> 22:08.728
Anita,

22:08.761 --> 22:11.831
would you care
to dance?
Oh...

22:11.864 --> 22:13.165
no, no, no, no.
(chuckles)

22:13.199 --> 22:15.334
No, I'm good.
And, actually, it's...

22:15.368 --> 22:17.804
Anita, dance with her.

22:17.837 --> 22:22.208
* Broad daylight and we gonna
let them thangs bark *

22:22.241 --> 22:23.342
Why don't you take
your little sweater off

22:23.376 --> 22:25.144
so she can see your sexy body.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.346
* Free breezy, yo
* Breezy

22:27.380 --> 22:30.349
* Tell my,
tell my Shmurda teamin', bro *
* Teamin'

22:30.383 --> 22:33.019
* Caught about a week ago,
a week ago *

22:33.052 --> 22:35.254
* With us and then
we tweakin', tweakin'... *

22:42.695 --> 22:44.864
Damn, Cookie. Where are you?
It's Jermel.

22:44.897 --> 22:47.867
I need you to get Lucious to
protect me from Frank Gathers.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.903
You're in danger.
And your kids, too.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.875
Ms. Whiteman office
called back again.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.344
Hmm.
And somebody sent you
some ugly flowers.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.746
Who?

22:59.779 --> 23:01.548
I don't know.
Ma, Jamal's assistant

23:01.581 --> 23:03.683
busts onto the mixing stage
while I'm rehearsing,

23:03.716 --> 23:05.384
ordered me to come
to some meeting.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.619
You know I don't take orders
from Jamal

23:06.653 --> 23:08.354
or his punk-ass assistant.
Hakeem...

23:08.387 --> 23:09.856
(phone ringing)

23:09.889 --> 23:11.257
That's Carol trying
to videoconference you.

23:11.290 --> 23:12.925
Yeah, tell her
I'll call her back later.

23:12.959 --> 23:15.728
(ringing continues)

23:15.762 --> 23:17.697
Hey, Carol. Cookie says

23:17.730 --> 23:20.700
she gonna call you back.
Porsha, did she get
some flowers?

23:20.733 --> 23:23.369
Yeah. You sent them?
Ooh. I got to go.
No, it's the guy.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.404
It's that crazy guy.
I-I'll tell her you sent 'em.
I got to go.

23:25.438 --> 23:26.739
I got to boo-boo.
Porsha, wait...

23:26.773 --> 23:30.042
Oh, this bitch.
(groans)

23:30.076 --> 23:32.111
Put that damn phone down
and listen to me.

23:32.144 --> 23:35.782
Ms. Whiteman has committed
$250 million.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.083
She's in.
She is going

23:37.116 --> 23:40.820
to make her move
in the next 24 hours.

23:40.853 --> 23:43.089
We will get our company,

23:43.122 --> 23:45.892
and I want Jamal
to be a part of it.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.928
Y'all gotta be
in a good place.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.631
(lock beeps, door opens)

23:54.433 --> 23:55.635
Leave us alone.

23:55.668 --> 23:58.771
You must be the
new prosecutor.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.773
According
to the federal statute,

24:00.807 --> 24:03.710
this meeting is... illegal.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.313
I saw an old friend of yours

24:07.346 --> 24:09.782
the other day.
He sends his regards.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.851
I got a lot of old friends,
Roxanne.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.186
You don't mind
if I call you Roxanne, do you?

24:14.220 --> 24:16.188
What you should call me
is your worst nightmare,

24:16.222 --> 24:18.491
because that's
exactly what I'm gonna be.

24:18.525 --> 24:21.661
See that?
You just gave me goose bumps.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.631
So what did this old friend
of mine have to say?

24:24.664 --> 24:26.499
Vernon thinks
that Bunkie's murder

24:26.533 --> 24:28.467
had to do with more
than extortion.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.537
Plead guilty,

24:30.570 --> 24:32.539
and then we can start talking
about some of the other killers

24:32.572 --> 24:34.473
in your business.

24:34.507 --> 24:37.810
You help us take them down,
I promise you won't die in here.

24:37.844 --> 24:40.379
So that's your campaign, huh?

24:40.412 --> 24:41.981
You're planning
on running

24:42.014 --> 24:45.351
for attorney general,
but as a Republican.

24:45.384 --> 24:47.954
And you think that being
the black bitch in cheap shoes

24:47.987 --> 24:50.389
who took down hip-hop,
that's your way to victory.

24:51.991 --> 24:55.027
Let me share something with you,
Ms. Clarence Thomas.

24:55.061 --> 24:57.897
I don't care how many of us
you lock behind bars.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.332
You ain't never gonna be nothing
but a black bitch

25:00.366 --> 25:01.668
in cheap shoes to me.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.335
A black bitch in cheap shoes

25:03.369 --> 25:05.705
that'll jam them right up
your yellow ass.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.707
Is that how you want it?

25:08.941 --> 25:11.644
I'd pay good money for it.

25:11.678 --> 25:14.847
If I were you,
I would consider my offer.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.883
It's the best one
you're gonna get.

25:18.785 --> 25:22.689
And they're Tom Ford,
by the way.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.056
(knocks on door)

25:24.090 --> 25:25.491
Hey.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.594
(door opens)

25:27.627 --> 25:28.928
(indistinct chatter)

25:36.435 --> 25:38.871
How's your music?
Good.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.439
Spit something for me.

25:40.472 --> 25:41.874
He in jail. Do it.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.676
(sighs)

25:43.710 --> 25:45.912
* They tell me
if you really want it that bad *

25:45.945 --> 25:48.881
* You better go out
and get it, so you know
I'll be writing songs forever *

25:48.915 --> 25:51.784
* But since a young'un,
I been on but never
had the time to shine *

25:51.818 --> 25:53.786
* These people fear
what they don't know,
manipulated my grind *

25:53.820 --> 25:56.022
* I played the bench, applying
pressure from the sideline *

25:56.055 --> 25:58.791
* Never gave a damn about a
hater try and take mine, I was *

25:58.825 --> 26:01.560
* My own boss, always took
my own loss, solid as a rock *

26:01.594 --> 26:02.962
* But when I slipped,
I took my own fall *

26:02.995 --> 26:05.297
* They askin',
"Why you do that, baby?" *

26:05.331 --> 26:07.734
* I'm whilin' on the block,
like, "Why you do that, baby?" *

26:07.767 --> 26:10.737
* They wonder...
* I like the way you rhyme
and how you grew that daisy. *

26:11.838 --> 26:13.640
That's your little girl?

26:13.673 --> 26:15.207
Yeah, that's my girl.
Wow,

26:15.241 --> 26:17.176
you are powerful, miss.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.246
Lucious,
you got another visitor

26:20.279 --> 26:21.280
in Room A.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.951
I'm not complaining,
but I have 20 minutes

26:24.984 --> 26:26.653
before the board
meeting, Becky.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.454
Complaining. They're trying
to do something nice for you.

26:28.487 --> 26:29.622
Turn that around, boo.
(man singing nearby)

26:29.656 --> 26:31.290
Who's singing?
Michael's in there

26:31.323 --> 26:33.626
with the gay and lesbian people.
They've been waiting.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.794
BECKY:
It's the GLAAD people.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.128
Fix your face, come on.

26:36.162 --> 26:37.797
* Mighty real

26:37.830 --> 26:41.133
* I've been dancing
on the floor, darling *

26:41.167 --> 26:43.970
* And I feel like
I need some more *

26:44.003 --> 26:47.006
* And I feel your body

26:47.039 --> 26:50.677
* Close to mine
and I know my love *

26:50.710 --> 26:53.980
* It's about that time
to make me feel *

26:54.013 --> 26:56.683
BECKY: Be nice.
* Mighty real

26:56.716 --> 27:00.519
* You make me feel

27:00.552 --> 27:05.324
* Mighty real

27:05.357 --> 27:08.094
* You make me feel

27:08.127 --> 27:11.130
* Mighty real

27:11.163 --> 27:13.432
* Oh.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.701
This is beautiful.
So great; that's great.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.502
Hi, Jamal.
How you doing?

27:16.535 --> 27:18.337
I'm so excited
to be giving you an award.

27:18.370 --> 27:19.839
Thank you.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.140
Let's do a duet after.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.975
Oh.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.176
Becky, let's think
about that.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.211
Don't be shady.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.478
It'll be fun!

27:26.512 --> 27:27.814
(laughing)
Becky,

27:27.847 --> 27:29.348
Donnie McClurkin will be there.

27:29.381 --> 27:30.883
Donnie McClurkin?

27:30.917 --> 27:32.318
I love him!

27:32.351 --> 27:33.853
Do you?

27:33.886 --> 27:36.122
We fall down,
but we get up, don't we?

27:36.155 --> 27:38.124
Won't he will!
Will he won't!

27:38.157 --> 27:39.692
Ooh, shando!

27:39.726 --> 27:40.860
(laughter)

27:45.164 --> 27:47.233
Hakeem, it's happening.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.102
Let's get it.

27:58.945 --> 28:01.647
* They tell me if you really
want it that bad *

28:01.680 --> 28:03.549
* You go on and get it

28:03.582 --> 28:05.184
* So you know I'll be
writing rhymes forever *

28:05.217 --> 28:07.153
* But since a young'un,
I've been on but never *

28:07.186 --> 28:09.021
* Had the time to shine;
these people fear *

28:09.055 --> 28:11.223
* What they don't know,
manipulated my grind... *

28:11.257 --> 28:12.825
I know that we were
all surprised

28:12.859 --> 28:14.360
by the large share purchase
from today,

28:14.393 --> 28:16.228
but I just want to let
all y'all know we're fine.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.230
Empire is just as strong
as we've ever been.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.232
Actually it's much
stronger, Jamal.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.068
'Cause we're taking it over.

28:22.101 --> 28:23.569
COOKIE: Didn't I tell you to
let me do the talking?

28:23.602 --> 28:25.237
Now, let me explain
how this is gonna work.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.739
Hey, sister girl.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.540
(groans quietly)

28:28.574 --> 28:30.743
In partnership with a woman
by the name of Mimi Whiteman,

28:30.777 --> 28:33.245
we have taken a controlling
interest in Empire.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.347
But that doesn't mean we're
gonna take it from you, Jamal.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.749
ANIKA: We're taking
it from Lucious.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.350
Our first order
of business

28:38.384 --> 28:40.719
is removing
Lucious Lyon as CEO.

28:40.753 --> 28:42.354
Sorry, brother,
it's just business.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.756
Don't be so mean.

28:43.790 --> 28:46.125
No, it's just business.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.359
Yes.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.128
Right, Mimi?

28:52.431 --> 28:53.532
We had a deal!

28:53.565 --> 28:54.533
I met with Lucious this morning

28:54.566 --> 28:55.935
and made a better deal.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.070
(chuckles)

28:59.939 --> 29:01.974
I thought I told you
to sleep with her.

29:02.008 --> 29:03.409
I did.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.744
You can't even dyke right.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.646
I'd give Anita an A for effort.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.248
You made all
the right moves.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.050
I wanted a little music company
to play with.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.820
You convinced me
to invest in Empire.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.387
You just forgot
one little detail.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.990
Lucious Lyon is Empire.

29:18.024 --> 29:20.059
Empire is Lucious Lyon.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.894
Without him,
the company's nothing.

29:21.928 --> 29:25.264
Oh, someone
wants to say something.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.033
(laughing)

29:28.334 --> 29:30.002
Hi.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.737
(Lucious laughs)

29:31.770 --> 29:33.906
Game over, bitches.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.042
Bye-bye.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.858
Come on, man, just stop.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.326
Just tell me
what I need to know...

29:54.360 --> 29:56.863
and we okay.

30:00.833 --> 30:04.170
It was Cookie.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.838
Come on, brah.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.807
Cookie Lyon ain't no snitch.

30:08.841 --> 30:10.376
You got to do better than that.

30:10.409 --> 30:13.812
It was Cookie.

30:26.893 --> 30:29.395
Frank Gathers.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.369
That bitch.

30:37.403 --> 30:39.371
Can't you see
I was doing this

30:39.405 --> 30:42.241
to protect you, Jamal?

30:42.274 --> 30:44.843
Y-You can't see that?
No.

30:44.877 --> 30:48.347
You call it protecting,
I call it back-stabbing.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.749
When he threw me in a trashcan,
he did it to my face.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.818
I pulled you out
of the trashcan, Jamal.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.253
I didn't betray you.

30:54.286 --> 30:56.222
You were always gonna be
a part of the company.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.057
Was I gonna run it?

30:58.090 --> 30:59.691
No, because you wanted to.

30:59.725 --> 31:01.393
It was my sacrifice that
started this company.

31:01.427 --> 31:04.030
"My sacrifice
that started this company."

31:04.063 --> 31:05.864
I'm so sick and tired
of hearing the same old thing.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.333
Yeah, Ma, you sacrificed.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.701
But that don't give you
the right to tear us down.

31:09.735 --> 31:11.904
(laughs quietly)

31:13.739 --> 31:16.208
You're turning into
your daddy.

31:16.242 --> 31:19.245
(wry laugh)
I'm watching it happen.

31:35.161 --> 31:36.528
(door closes)

31:36.562 --> 31:38.364
KIDS:
Hey, Aunt Cookie!

31:38.397 --> 31:40.032
Hey.

31:40.066 --> 31:41.100
Carol?

31:41.133 --> 31:43.936
How did you get
in my house?

31:43.970 --> 31:45.437
And why they playing
with my wigs?

31:45.471 --> 31:46.939
'Cause I like this one.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.941
Oh, girl, you better
put that brush down.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.943
Cookie...

31:50.977 --> 31:52.478
I tried to tell that dumb-ass
assistant of yours

31:52.511 --> 31:54.713
that the roses
isn't a mistake this time.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.248
What roses?

31:56.282 --> 31:58.250
Cookie, the roses.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.319
They're really
from Frank Gathers.

32:04.856 --> 32:07.293
Kisha, Kisha!

32:07.326 --> 32:08.961
Hey, hey! Luther, you guys,
go in the other room.

32:08.995 --> 32:11.330
Go, go, go, go!

32:13.432 --> 32:15.334
Ah! Put that down!
Put that down!

32:29.948 --> 32:32.418
(both gasping)

32:32.451 --> 32:35.287
Oh, no, no, no...

32:35.321 --> 32:36.855
No!

32:36.888 --> 32:38.024
They kind of
sprung the whole

32:38.057 --> 32:39.825
Miss Lawrence thing
on me, Jamal.

32:39.858 --> 32:41.027
I know you're
not comfortable

32:41.060 --> 32:42.428
around flamboyant
dudes like that.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.795
That ain't true.

32:43.829 --> 32:45.331
Oh, come on.
You just hate him

32:45.364 --> 32:46.832
'cause he's too
real for you.

32:46.865 --> 32:48.700
But it puts me
in a bad position.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.802
All right, well...

32:50.836 --> 32:52.471
what you want me to do?

32:52.504 --> 32:54.973
Y'all-y'all want some money--
like $50,000?

32:55.007 --> 32:56.708
(scoffs)

32:56.742 --> 32:59.811
So you're gonna
buy us with $50,000

32:59.845 --> 33:01.180
'cause you're canceling
at the last minute?

33:01.213 --> 33:02.814
What you want?

33:02.848 --> 33:06.185
You want 100?
That what you want?

33:06.218 --> 33:08.354
You want all this
money off Empire?

33:08.387 --> 33:10.156
This is my company.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.458
Yes.
Mm.

33:12.491 --> 33:15.027
Well, look, make
the announcement tonight

33:15.061 --> 33:17.429
and you apologize for me
not coming.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.201
You're shady.

33:22.234 --> 33:25.071
JAMAL:
* If I had to sell

33:26.405 --> 33:28.507
* Just a piece of me

33:30.176 --> 33:33.545
* Tell me what you see

33:33.579 --> 33:38.084
* In my life

33:38.117 --> 33:41.019
* For what can I keep

33:42.388 --> 33:45.991
* If you empty me

33:46.024 --> 33:49.161
* A catastrophe

33:49.195 --> 33:51.563
* A waste of time

33:53.432 --> 33:55.567
* So I

33:55.601 --> 33:58.237
* Won't sell it

33:58.270 --> 34:02.074
* I'm gon' keep it

34:02.108 --> 34:05.911
* You won't get

34:05.944 --> 34:08.714
* What's mine

34:08.747 --> 34:09.881
(phone rings)

34:09.915 --> 34:12.284
* Whoa, yesterday

34:12.318 --> 34:13.852
Yeah.

34:13.885 --> 34:17.456
* I had to pray

34:17.489 --> 34:20.392
* I'm looking

34:20.426 --> 34:22.461
* For a sign...
Yeah, I got it. Hold on.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.463
(music stops)
Yo.

34:24.496 --> 34:27.099
(over speaker):
Your mother's on the phone.
Just deal with it.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.201
No.
Boy, I'm not taking
another Cookie cuss-out

34:29.235 --> 34:31.537
'cause you don't want
to answer the phone.
Well, I don't care

34:31.570 --> 34:33.205
about it either way.
I ain't, either.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.241
Please just deal with it.

34:37.276 --> 34:39.211
Thank you.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.812
Ma, seriously?
This is the first time

34:40.846 --> 34:42.614
I've been in the studio
in three weeks.

34:42.648 --> 34:45.384
Jamal, listen to me.
This is not a joke.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.487
Stop what you're doing right
now, go to your father's house.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.422
You will be safe there.
You hear me?
Why?

34:50.456 --> 34:53.759
I am not joking.
This is very real. Okay?

34:54.926 --> 34:56.128
Hey, what is this?

34:56.162 --> 34:57.929
Jamal, just go.

34:57.963 --> 34:59.231
I'll see you later.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.833
(sobbing)

35:01.867 --> 35:05.003
Why are you over there
crying like Tammy Faye Bakker?

35:05.036 --> 35:07.939
Get your ass together. Get them
kids and go over to Lucious's.

35:07.973 --> 35:09.975
Go, Carol!

35:16.982 --> 35:17.983
(lock buzzes, clicks)

35:35.334 --> 35:37.536
Why you looking like Mr. T?

35:37.569 --> 35:39.538
Ain't nobody come
all the way out here

35:39.571 --> 35:42.140
to play no games
with you, Lucious.

35:43.742 --> 35:46.212
(chuckles)

35:46.245 --> 35:49.215
For whatever reason,
I still love you.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.516
Oh...
I do,

35:50.549 --> 35:53.051
and I'm so sorry I didn't...

35:53.084 --> 35:55.387
come and visit you
all those years in here.

35:55.421 --> 35:56.988
This place is hell.

35:57.022 --> 36:00.226
Three months.
You been in here three months.

36:00.259 --> 36:02.894
Talk to me after five years.
If there's

36:02.928 --> 36:05.664
any justice,
we'll have that conversation.

36:05.697 --> 36:07.866
You mean that?
What, you think I don't,

36:07.899 --> 36:09.635
'cause I threw
that little concert?

36:09.668 --> 36:12.704
Nah. See, I know you threw
that little concert

36:12.738 --> 36:16.074
'cause you was trying to impress
that big investor of yours.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.477
Real sorry that
didn't work out for you, babe.

36:18.510 --> 36:21.179
I did that
for our sons, Lucious.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.515
That's...

36:25.584 --> 36:28.354
It's tearing my babies apart,
having you in here.

36:28.387 --> 36:31.690
You always were
ride or die.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.825
Save that for Anika.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.762
Or one of these little boys
you messing around with in here.

36:36.795 --> 36:43.669
(laughing)

36:43.702 --> 36:45.704
That's crazy how
I can love your ass

36:45.737 --> 36:47.739
and hate you at
the same moment.

36:51.943 --> 36:55.314
All right, so,
uh, why'd you come?

36:58.384 --> 37:00.452
They messing with us, Lucious.

37:00.486 --> 37:02.254
Who's messing with you?

37:02.288 --> 37:04.423
That skinny...

37:04.456 --> 37:06.425
animal.

37:06.458 --> 37:07.759
Idi Amin.

37:07.793 --> 37:10.228
Frankie?

37:13.332 --> 37:14.766
I need you to fix it.

37:19.305 --> 37:20.672
So, what'd he do?

37:26.312 --> 37:28.580
GATHERS:
Lucious. Over here.

37:32.684 --> 37:35.220
Came solo.
It shows respect.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.523
Sometimes that's
all we got.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.662
Brother, I wanted
to tell you...

37:43.695 --> 37:46.665
if there's a problem
between us,

37:46.698 --> 37:49.335
we... we can always
work it out.

37:51.470 --> 37:52.838
(playing discordant notes)

37:52.871 --> 37:55.474
Oh, my God.

37:55.507 --> 37:58.644
That damn piano.
Can you make them stop?

37:58.677 --> 38:01.513
Aunt Carol, did she say how long

38:01.547 --> 38:03.281
we're supposed to be here?

38:03.315 --> 38:05.283
No.

38:05.317 --> 38:07.419
Okay, well, did she say
what it's about?

38:07.453 --> 38:09.821
All right.
Listen,

38:09.855 --> 38:12.290
there's this guy

38:12.324 --> 38:15.394
that we used to move drugs for
back in the day.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.631
And he was...
he was really dangerous.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.299
How dangerous?

38:21.333 --> 38:23.301
LUCIOUS:
Now, first of all,

38:23.335 --> 38:25.504
I want to apologize
if I overstepped some bounds

38:25.537 --> 38:27.339
with you and your
little girl, and...

38:27.373 --> 38:28.807
she's just
really talented.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.809
Yeah, thanks a lot, man.
She's special,

38:30.842 --> 38:32.778
and that's why
I think there's a...

38:32.811 --> 38:34.780
a home for her at Empire.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.648
With your blessing.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.817
We got a bigger problem
here, Lucious.

38:38.850 --> 38:42.187
And you throwing my daughter
a bone ain't gonna fix it.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.955
Cookie's a snitch.

38:43.989 --> 38:47.158
She rat me out to the Feds.
That's how she got out so early.

38:47.192 --> 38:49.327
Now we both know I got to do
something about that.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.897
This is between
me and Cookie.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.632
Me and you are cool.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.667
Unless you tell me
something different.

39:00.271 --> 39:02.273
Um...

39:04.376 --> 39:05.877
Yeah, we good.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.349
Cold-blooded.

39:11.383 --> 39:12.851
That's why I always liked you.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.521
Always liked you, too.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.756
But I love Cookie,
and if you got war with her,

39:17.789 --> 39:19.791
then you got war with me.

39:21.627 --> 39:23.595
Wow.

39:23.629 --> 39:26.364
You are crazy.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.366
Crazier than I thought.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.369
Kill him.

39:31.403 --> 39:33.371
Make it fast

39:33.405 --> 39:35.541
and quiet.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.443
Bye.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.545
I'm sorry,
I think you're confused.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.984
Now, please sit down.

39:48.787 --> 39:51.089
See, Frankie, you always
wanted to run the streets.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.792
But me, I wanted
to rule the world.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.794
Like Mike--
now, he may never

39:55.827 --> 39:57.563
see his mama again
'cause he's serving life,

39:57.596 --> 39:59.531
but he ain't got to
worry about her mortgage,

39:59.565 --> 40:00.932
'cause I took care of that.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.934
And Bamm-Bamm,
his baby girl is sick.

40:02.968 --> 40:07.238
And she gonna need some help in
this cold-ass world that I rule.

40:07.272 --> 40:10.976
And, Guy, wh-what
was it again, Guy?

40:11.009 --> 40:12.878
Just the music, man.

40:12.911 --> 40:13.879
LUCIOUS:
That's right.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.113
He's a musician.

40:15.146 --> 40:16.915
Just like Freda.

40:19.818 --> 40:22.053
Kill him.

40:22.087 --> 40:26.825
Make it loud, and make it long.

40:26.858 --> 40:30.796
And by the way,
I'm-a sign your baby girl.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.798
And then I'm-a
slip her my bone.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.299
Bye.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.301
* Power *
* For the power

40:36.334 --> 40:38.403
* Power... *
* All for the power

40:38.436 --> 40:39.671
* For the power... *

40:39.705 --> 40:40.672
* For the power

40:40.706 --> 40:42.407
(Gathers screaming)

40:42.440 --> 40:43.975
* All for the power

40:44.009 --> 40:45.677
* Power *
* Of the empire...

40:45.711 --> 40:47.546
(Gathers' scream echoing)

40:49.014 --> 40:52.317
I'm gonna bury
your album, Hakeem.

40:52.350 --> 40:54.319
It's never gonna see
the light of day.

40:54.352 --> 40:55.487
You'd do that to me?

40:57.055 --> 40:58.924
Empire's not gonna spend
hundreds of thousands of dollars

40:58.957 --> 41:00.926
on a artist that would
try to take us down.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.529
Nah, that's not
why you killing it.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.430
You don't want anyone to hear it

41:05.463 --> 41:06.798
'cause you want to be
the only one.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.266
I've always been the only one.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.801
That's what you thought.

41:09.835 --> 41:12.370
You know my album gonna
sell more than yours.

41:12.403 --> 41:13.972
But it's cool.

41:14.005 --> 41:16.842
You're right, Hakeem.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.309
That's the reason why.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.579
I deserve to be the king!

41:22.180 --> 41:23.715
COOKIE:
It's over.

41:23.749 --> 41:25.350
It's all over.

41:28.587 --> 41:29.688
Where's Andre?

41:29.721 --> 41:30.956
Hey, Mom.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.357
Where's Carol?

41:32.390 --> 41:34.059
Upstairs in the playroom
with the kids.

41:34.092 --> 41:36.194
Can you please explain what
the hell is going on here?

41:36.227 --> 41:38.196
It was, um...
(chuckles)

41:38.229 --> 41:40.198
it was an old beef.

41:40.231 --> 41:41.900
With a very dangerous man.

41:43.702 --> 41:45.537
He took care of
it from prison?

41:45.571 --> 41:47.539
Yeah, well, your father's
a son of a bitch.

41:47.573 --> 41:48.840
(chuckles)

41:48.874 --> 41:50.842
But he's still your father.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.745
And I'm still your mother,
don't you ever forget that.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.720
Get out.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.655
You, you.

42:03.689 --> 42:06.658
Out. Andre, out.
Rhonda, get out.

42:06.692 --> 42:08.860
Jamal.
Right now.
You trippin'.

42:08.894 --> 42:10.596
Jamal...
Get out of my
father's house.

42:10.629 --> 42:11.897
You betrayed him,
all of you.
Your father's...

42:11.930 --> 42:13.565
And we don't want
anything to do with it.

42:13.599 --> 42:14.833
I'll happily leave, okay?
JAMAL: Thank you. Bye.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.067
Come on, babe, let's go.

42:16.101 --> 42:18.737
Andre, I'm gonna
take care of this, baby.

42:18.770 --> 42:20.572
It's not even your house.
Come on, Hakeem.

42:20.606 --> 42:21.707
I got it.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.008
No, just go ahead.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.010
Jamal, look.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.612
I can fix this, baby.

42:26.645 --> 42:27.879
You know I can.

42:27.913 --> 42:29.681
Uh, look, we can
be a family again.

42:29.715 --> 42:31.583
Get out.

42:33.484 --> 42:36.722
Who you think
you're talking to?

42:45.897 --> 42:47.899
You done now, lady.

43:47.826 --> 43:48.860
Yeah.

43:48.894 --> 43:51.396
