DRAGON:
In a land of myth and a time of magic,

00:05.214 --> 00:10.261
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.386 --> 00:13.222
His name, Merlin.

(DUCKS QUACKING)

00:59.393 --> 01:02.313
(DOGS BARKING)

01:03.731 --> 01:05.816
Found him.

01:06.317 --> 01:08.444
It's harvest time.

01:10.780 --> 01:13.241
What's this?
Where's the rest of it?

01:13.324 --> 01:16.494
| only kept back what we need
to survive.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.829
Survive?

01:18.955 --> 01:21.165
I'll be back in
one week, farmer,

01:21.249 --> 01:23.584
and I want to see all of it.

01:23.668 --> 01:25.461
You can't take our food.

01:25.544 --> 01:28.673
Our children will starve!
| won't let you do this.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.424
You're not taking any of it!

01:30.508 --> 01:31.676
(EXCLAIMS)

01:31.801 --> 01:33.844
Hunith!

01:39.642 --> 01:41.769

01:42.853 --> 01:45.189
Don't you dare disappoint me.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.610
I'll see you later, sweetheart.

Mother!

Merlin.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.273
What happened?

02:28.983 --> 02:31.110
Who did this to you?

03:03.934 --> 03:08.397
The winters are harsh in Ealdor
and there are many children.

03:08.481 --> 03:11.859
Some of them just won't be
strong enough to survive.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.695
We barely have
enough food as it is

03:15.529 --> 03:18.157
and if Kanen
takes our harvest,

03:18.240 --> 03:21.369
our children won't live
to see another summer.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.829
Please, we need your help.

03:25.081 --> 03:27.333
Ealdor's in Cenred's Kingdom.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.543
Your safety is his responsibility.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.962
We've appealed to our King,

03:32.046 --> 03:34.882
but he cares little
for the outlying regions.

03:35.508 --> 03:36.801
You're our only hope.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.558
| have the deepest sympathy for you

03:44.892 --> 03:48.854
and would have this barbarian wiped
off the face of the earth.

03:48.938 --> 03:51.607
-You'll help us?
-I wish I could.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.692
Surely, we can spare
a few men.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.653
Resources are not the problem.

03:55.736 --> 03:59.990
-Then what is?
-Ealdor lies beyond Aesctir.

04:00.783 --> 04:04.036
For an army of Camelots to enter it
would be an act of war.

04:06.205 --> 04:09.667
| know you're a good king,
a caring man.

04:10.418 --> 04:13.671
I'm begging you.
Help us, please.

04:14.713 --> 04:19.176
The accord we've struck with Cenred
was years in the making.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.681
| cannot risk hundreds of lives for
the sake of one village.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.600
I'm afraid Camelot cannot help.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.328
I'm sorry.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.999
If it were up to me
we'd be on our way there now.

04:50.332 --> 04:54.420
Oh, you tried. And thank you for getting
an audience with the King.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.923
| wish Camelot was able
to help people

04:58.007 --> 05:00.468
regardless of how
far away they lived.

05:03.846 --> 05:06.432
I'm going back to Ealdor.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.601
Of course.

05:10.019 --> 05:12.104
It's been an honor serving you.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.568
-You'll be coming back?
-Well, she's my mother.

05:18.277 --> 05:21.197
| have got to look after her
before anyone else.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.368
-You understand?
-I'd do exactly the same.

05:28.454 --> 05:32.708
Well, you've been terrible, really.

05:32.791 --> 05:35.753
| mean it, the worst servant
I've ever had.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.758
Thank you, sire.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.889

05:47.056 --> 05:49.225
Good luck.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.817
Here.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.448
Tell me how it feels.

06:05.366 --> 06:08.244
Yeah,
yeah, that feels really good.

06:08.327 --> 06:11.539
It's very,
um, you know, swordy.

06:14.667 --> 06:17.086
I've packed
some armor for you.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.963
| won't be able to carry all that.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.131
(DOOR OPENING)

06:21.257 --> 06:23.342
You won't have to.

06:24.176 --> 06:27.137
-We're coming with you.
-What do you mean?

06:27.346 --> 06:29.473
You're going to need
all the help you can get.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.809
| can mend armor and sharpen swords.

06:31.892 --> 06:35.896
-And I know how to fight.
-But you, you can't.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.482
| mean, why would you?

06:38.566 --> 06:40.985
If it was the other way round
you'd help us.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.654
You already have.
You saved my life.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.365
And you helped me get the Druid
out of Camelot.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.951
We owe it to you, both of us.

06:52.037 --> 06:55.040
-You've got the food I prepared for you?
-Yes.

06:55.124 --> 06:56.875
Be careful with the wine.
You know what you're like.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.795

you're singing like a sailor.

06:59.878 --> 07:00.921

You're sure you don't want
an extra blanket?

07:02.756 --> 07:06.260
It's okay, really.
I'll be all right.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.762

07:45.799 --> 07:48.636
Nobody knows.

07:48.719 --> 07:52.222
She's the only person I know
who isn't frightened.

07:52.723 --> 07:57.144
It won't make any difference
to Kanen that they're women.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.313
| know.

08:00.064 --> 08:02.566
But I couldn't talk them out of coming.

08:08.906 --> 08:11.784
I'm going to make him pay
for what he did to you.

08:11.909 --> 08:15.120
Promise me you'll be careful.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.666
No one can find out about you.

08:18.749 --> 08:22.252
They won't. They never do.

-Uh, maybe a few hours.

-How many men does Kanen have?
-Oh, I'm not sure.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.201
| think from what my mother's said,
maybe as many as 40.

10:19.912 --> 10:23.916
We should get some rest.

When I first met Arthur,
| was exactly like you.

pompous and arrogant.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.829

what he does.

Really? Let's wait until
the fighting begins

15:40.357 --> 15:42.359
and see who he sends in
to die first.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.944
| guarantee you, it won't be him.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.947
-I trust Arthur with my life.
-Is that so?

15:48.031 --> 15:50.158
So he knows your secret then?

15:52.369 --> 15:56.373
Face it, Merlin. You're living
a lie, just like you were here.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.543
You're Arthur's servant,
nothing more.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.170
Otherwise you'd
tell him the truth.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.015

slept on the floor?

16:15.225 --> 16:19.354
Yeah. The bed I've got in Camelot's
luxury by comparison.

-Mmm.

-It's like rock.
- I didn't mean the ground, I meant,

-for you it must've been difficult.
-Hmm.

a roof over your head, you're happy.

16:40.876 --> 16:43.420
Sounds nice.

-You'd hate lit.
-No doubt.

Come on, stop pretending
to be interesting. Tell me.

that I did.

and fetch the stick yourself.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.473
-No offense, Merlin.
-None taken.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.975

you didn't finish your breakfast.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.312
-Didn't I?
-Come on, eat up.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.568
Mmm.

17:50.654 --> 17:52.989
Right, Let's get going.
We need wood, and lots of it.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.158
Of course.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.788
Arthur said it was lovely.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.420
He must care for
you a great deal.

18:07.504 --> 18:10.799
Arthur would do the same for any
village. That's just the way he is.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.427
It's more than that.
He's here for you.

18:14.511 --> 18:17.264
-I'm just his servant.
-Give him more credit than that.

18:17.347 --> 18:20.976
-He likes you.
-That's because he doesn't know me.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.770
And if he did,
I'd probably be dead by now.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.022
You don't really believe that,
do you?

18:30.151 --> 18:33.196
Merlin?
Where are you going with that thing?

18:33.280 --> 18:35.282
What does it look like?
We need wood.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.449
(CHUCKLES)

18:36.533 --> 18:39.202
We both know that you don't need
an ax to fell a tree.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.037
And I remember
the trouble it got me into.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.706
| nearly flattened
old man Simmons.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.292
(LAUGHS) Yeah, he deserved it.
Stupid old crone.

18:45.834 --> 18:50.088
-Hmm, he never did like me anyway.
-Even less after that.

18:54.676 --> 18:57.637
-Why are you being like this?
-You know why.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.734
Why did you leave?

19:12.068 --> 19:14.154
It wasn't what I wanted.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.613
My mother was worried.

19:15.697 --> 19:18.325
When she found out you knew,
she was so angry.

19:18.408 --> 19:21.995
-I wouldn't have told anyone.
-I know you wouldn't.

19:27.417 --> 19:31.338
You'd be able to defeat Kanen
on your own, wouldn't you?

19:31.421 --> 19:32.589
I'm not sure. Maybe.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.758
So, what's stopping you?
So what if Arthur finds out?

19:34.883 --> 19:37.927
- I don't expect you to understand.
-Try me.

19:38.011 --> 19:40.930
One day, Arthur will be a great king.
But he needs my help.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.850
And if anyone ever found out
about my powers,

19:43.933 --> 19:45.852
I'd have to leave Camelot for good.

19:45.935 --> 19:49.189
You're telling me you'd rather keep your
magic a secret for Arthur's sake,

19:49.272 --> 19:52.525
than use it to protect
your friends and family?

19:59.949 --> 20:02.202
| won't be able to teach you
everything there is to know

20:02.285 --> 20:04.371
about fighting with a sword,

20:04.454 --> 20:06.539
but you can learn the basics.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.042
The stance, parry a blow,

20:09.125 --> 20:11.127
how to land your own.

20:11.252 --> 20:17.634
On my count,
one, two, three, four.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.389
Now you may have to watch
for the feint.

20:22.472 --> 20:25.558
Keep your feet moving and only
stay in range long enough

20:25.642 --> 20:28.395
to land your blow. Again.

20:28.478 --> 20:33.608
One, two, three, four.

20:34.150 --> 20:39.447
One, two, three, four.

20:39.531 --> 20:42.242
There's no way they're gonna be
able to hold Kanen off.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.285
Men aren't the only
ones who can fight.

20:44.369 --> 20:46.329
Again. One,

20:46.663 --> 20:49.791
two, three.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.128
Matthew.

20:53.253 --> 20:58.550
| want you to organize sentry duty to
keep an eye out for Kanen and his men.

20:58.633 --> 20:59.968
I'd be glad to.

21:00.051 --> 21:03.763
If there's any sign of attack,
| want you to ride straight back here.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.932
| don't want you
fighting him all on your own.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.692
Looks like the battle's already
fought and lost.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.778
-They'll toughen up.
-GWEN: They need to.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.780
How're we doing for weapons?

21:20.864 --> 21:24.742
There isn't much, but we should be able
to scrape together what you need.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.119
It's not the weapons
that worry us,

21:26.202 --> 21:28.830
it's having enough people
to use them.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.624
We think the women should be
allowed to fight.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.460
MORGANA:
You haven't enough men.

21:33.543 --> 21:38.548
If they were trained soldiers maybe
you'd stand a chance but they're not.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.343
It's too dangerous.

21:43.928 --> 21:46.931
Right, back on your feet!
Come on! Let's go!

21:58.526 --> 22:01.237
GWEN: We don't stand a chance.

22:01.321 --> 22:04.657
Arthur can't see that.
He's too stubborn.

22:06.326 --> 22:09.120
Why do you think he came here?

22:09.287 --> 22:13.249
The same reason we did.
Merlin.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.793
Arthur may act like
he doesn't care

22:15.877 --> 22:18.713
but he wouldn't be here if he didn't.

22:18.796 --> 22:22.050
We're not going to be able to defend
Ealdor with sword and sinew alone.

22:22.133 --> 22:25.386
We're going to need a plan.
We need to find some way

22:25.470 --> 22:30.141
of limiting their mobility
and drawing them into a trap.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.434
If we fight them
on their terms then...

22:31.518 --> 22:33.311
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

22:33.394 --> 22:35.605
No!

22:37.524 --> 22:39.609
Get him down from there.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.340
What does it say?

23:02.423 --> 23:04.968
Make the most of this day,
it'll be your last.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.804
Matthew! No!

23:07.887 --> 23:10.890
No! No!

23:10.974 --> 23:14.102
You did this! Look what you've done!
You've killed him.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.311
It wasn't his fault.

23:15.395 --> 23:16.771
If it hadn't been
instructing around,

23:16.854 --> 23:18.565
treating us like his
own personal army,

23:18.648 --> 23:20.275
this would never have happened.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.735
These men are brave enough

23:22.819 --> 23:25.196
to fight for what they believe in,
even if you aren't.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.365
You're sending
them to their graves.

23:27.490 --> 23:28.825
(SOBBING)

23:28.908 --> 23:30.535
You've killed one man.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.620
How many more need to die
before you realize

23:32.704 --> 23:34.664
this is a battle that can't be won?

23:35.832 --> 23:38.418
When Kanen comes,
you haven't got a chance.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.837
You're going to be slaughtered.

23:48.678 --> 23:50.096
Don't bother, Merlin,
I'm not interested.

23:50.179 --> 23:51.347
You should be.

23:51.514 --> 23:52.849
"Cause tomorrow
if Kanen attacks,

23:52.932 --> 23:54.934
whether you like it or not,
we'll have to fight.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.603
Not if I'm not here.

23:56.686 --> 23:59.272
Well, that's up to you,
but the rest of us are staying.

24:00.189 --> 24:04.277
Join us, Will.
This isn't about Arthur,

24:04.360 --> 24:07.780
this is about your friends.
Are you really going to abandon them?

24:08.448 --> 24:10.533
-What? Like you did.
-I'm here now.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.369
Yeah, you are and you could end this.

24:13.494 --> 24:16.372
If you used your magic
no one else would have to die.

24:16.497 --> 24:18.541
You know I can't.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.336
Can't or won't?

24:21.878 --> 24:24.839
I'm not the one abandoning
these people, Merlin.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.885
You are.

24:50.531 --> 24:52.867
William's father was killed

24:54.410 --> 24:56.579
fighting for King Cenred.

24:57.497 --> 25:00.208
So he doesn't trust
anyone of nobility.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.045
Do you think the villagers believed him?

25:04.128 --> 25:05.505
No.

25:05.588 --> 25:09.425
He's always been
a troublemaker.

25:09.509 --> 25:13.262
-They're used to ignoring him.
-And if he's right?

25:14.931 --> 25:17.058
He isn't.

25:18.267 --> 25:22.438
I'm treating these men like soldiers
and they're not.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.607
You've seen them fight.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.610
They haven't got a clue.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.785
You need to tell them all to leave the
village before Kanen returns.

25:35.868 --> 25:40.039
No, we're going to stay, we're going to
fight and we're going to win.

25:40.123 --> 25:42.458
Merlin, it can't be done.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.628
-The odds are too great.
-It can.

25:45.712 --> 25:48.548
We're going to make Kanen rue the day
he ever came to this village.

25:48.631 --> 25:51.634
All you need to do is get the men
ready for battle,

25:51.759 --> 25:54.887
and the rest will
take care of itself.

25:54.971 --> 25:56.889
How?

25:56.973 --> 25:59.100
You've just got
to believe in them.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.438
Because if you don't,
they'll sense it.

26:04.272 --> 26:07.567
And the battle will be lost
before it's even begun.

26:09.110 --> 26:10.403
Tomorrow morning,

26:10.486 --> 26:13.156
the women and children should gather
what belongings they can carry

26:13.239 --> 26:14.323
and go to the woods.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.492
We're not going anywhere.

26:19.328 --> 26:22.915
| know you want to help. Women can't
stay here, it's too dangerous.

26:22.999 --> 26:27.170
The women have as much right to fight
for their lives as the men do.

26:27.295 --> 26:28.838
But none of you
know how to fight.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.424
The more of us there are,
the better chance we stand.

26:39.974 --> 26:42.185
This is your home,

26:42.268 --> 26:45.271
if you want to fight to defend it,
that's your choice.

26:45.354 --> 26:48.608
I'd be honored to
stand alongside you.

26:48.691 --> 26:51.110
Kanen attacks tomorrow.

26:51.194 --> 26:54.781
Kanen's brutal.
He fights only to Kill,

26:54.864 --> 26:58.034
which is why he
will never defeat us.

26:58.159 --> 27:00.536
Look around...

27:00.620 --> 27:04.123
In this circle
we're all equals.

27:04.207 --> 27:07.043
You're not fighting 'cause
someone's ordering you to.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.712
You're fighting
for so much more than that.

27:09.796 --> 27:15.551
You fight for your homes,
you fight for your family,

27:15.676 --> 27:18.054
you fight for your friends.

27:18.179 --> 27:22.642
You fight for the right to grow crops
in peace.

27:22.725 --> 27:28.314
And if you fall, you fall fighting
for the noblest of causes,

27:28.397 --> 27:31.484
fighting for your
very right to survive!

27:31.567 --> 27:35.071
When you're old and gray, you'll look
back on this day and you'll know

27:35.196 --> 27:38.825
you earned the right to live
every day in between.

27:38.908 --> 27:42.662
So you fight! For your family!

27:42.745 --> 27:45.832
For your friends! For Ealdor!

27:46.040 --> 27:48.751
-For Ealdor! Ealdor!
-Ealdor!

27:48.876 --> 27:51.170
Ealdor! Ealdor!

27:51.254 --> 27:54.674
Ealdor! Ealdor! Ealdor!

28:07.270 --> 28:09.397
Come here.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.574
| do love you, my boy.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.743
What's wrong?

28:27.456 --> 28:30.251
| should never have gone to Camelot.

28:31.127 --> 28:32.545
I've ruined everything for you.

28:32.628 --> 28:35.298
You haven't. Why would you say that?

28:36.924 --> 28:39.135
| know what you're planning to do.

28:40.261 --> 28:42.305
(SIGHS)

28:45.182 --> 28:48.102
If it comes to a choice

28:48.185 --> 28:54.358
between saving people's lives
and revealing who I really am...

28:56.485 --> 28:57.570
There is no choice.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.405
You can't let Arthur know
about your gift.

28:59.488 --> 29:00.990
Why not?

29:02.033 --> 29:04.619
Maybe it's meant
to be this way.

29:06.120 --> 29:11.500
And if he doesn't accept me
for who I really am,

29:11.626 --> 29:13.669
then,

29:15.296 --> 29:17.965
he's not the friend
| hoped he was.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.516
Arthur?

29:28.184 --> 29:31.020
Hunith made you some food.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.815
Thanks. I think.

29:36.317 --> 29:37.401
Food is scarce
for these people,

29:37.526 --> 29:39.987
you shouldn't turn your nose up at it.

29:40.905 --> 29:44.033
Oh, no. I shouldn't have spoken
to you like that. I'm sorry.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.159
-Gwen.
-I'm sorry.

29:45.242 --> 29:46.786
| don't know what I was thinking.
It won't happen again.

29:46.869 --> 29:47.995
Guinevere.

29:51.248 --> 29:54.043
Thank you. You're right.

29:55.378 --> 29:56.796
And you were right to speak up.

29:56.879 --> 29:59.215
| should've listened to you and Morgana.

29:59.340 --> 30:02.969
-We'll need all the help we can get.
-We'll be fine.

30:03.052 --> 30:06.222
-How can you be so sure?
-Because I have faith in you.

30:08.099 --> 30:10.685
| mean, we all do.

30:14.063 --> 30:16.190
Thank you.

30:23.906 --> 30:27.576
No, not today. Put on your own.

30:40.756 --> 30:43.634
-You ready?
-My throat's dry.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.387
Me, too.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.310
It's been an honor.

30:59.942 --> 31:02.737
Whatever happens
out there today,

31:02.820 --> 31:05.614
please don't think
any differently of me.

31:05.740 --> 31:09.618
| won't. It's all right to
be scared, Merlin.

31:11.620 --> 31:15.291
-That's not what I meant.
-What is it?

31:17.084 --> 31:20.963
If you've got something to say,
now's the time to say it.

31:25.468 --> 31:28.763
Arthur.
They've crossed the river.

31:40.149 --> 31:42.318
-You ready?
-Ready.

31:43.319 --> 31:45.529
Ealdor.

31:47.948 --> 31:50.326
-Are you frightened?
-Not in the slightest.

32:09.345 --> 32:11.472
(YELLING)

32:28.489 --> 32:30.533
Hold.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.832
No one moves until
| give the signal.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.227
Hold.

32:58.561 --> 33:02.898
Come out,
come out, wherever you are.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.901
Now, pull!

33:06.652 --> 33:08.737
(HORSES WHINNYING)

33:12.491 --> 33:15.077
Now, Morgana,
what're you waiting for?

33:15.161 --> 33:18.164
Something's gone wrong.

33:18.247 --> 33:20.416
Merlin!

33:22.334 --> 33:24.420
There's one. Get him!

33:28.090 --> 33:30.134
Kill him!

33:39.101 --> 33:41.187
Give me the flints.

33:44.982 --> 33:47.109
(CHANTING)

33:55.659 --> 33:58.120
Pull back! Go the other way!

34:11.967 --> 34:13.344
Now!

34:59.431 --> 35:01.517
Thanks.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.697

-Neither did I.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.869
(GRUNTING)

35:43.100 --> 35:45.227
There's too many of them.

35:45.394 --> 35:47.438
Not for me, there isn't.

Pendragon!

(GROANING)

38:16.378 --> 38:18.630
-Who did that?
-What?

38:18.714 --> 38:21.508
Wind like that doesn't just appear
from nowhere.

38:21.592 --> 38:25.596
| know magic when I see it.
One of you made it happen.

38:29.349 --> 38:31.435
Arthur...

38:32.519 --> 38:34.730
Look out!

38:37.107 --> 38:39.318
WVill!

38:42.362 --> 38:44.948
-You saved my life.
-Yeah.

38:45.741 --> 38:49.203
- I don't know what I was thinking.
-Come on. Get him inside.

39:06.386 --> 39:09.056
-That's twice I've saved you.
-Twice?

39:09.932 --> 39:12.017
It was me.

39:12.768 --> 39:14.853
-I'm the one that used the magic.
-Will, don't...

39:15.062 --> 39:16.188
It's all right.

39:16.271 --> 39:19.733
| won't be alive long enough
for anyone to do anything to me.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.861
| did it.

39:23.070 --> 39:25.322
| saw how desperate
things were becoming,

39:25.405 --> 39:27.366
| had to do something.

39:27.449 --> 39:29.535
You're a sorcerer?

39:29.701 --> 39:31.078
(CHUCKLES)

39:31.161 --> 39:34.998
Yeah, what are you gonna do?
Kill me?

39:37.834 --> 39:40.921
No. Of course not.

39:46.677 --> 39:48.762
Do what you can for him.

40:06.446 --> 40:08.615
| was right about him.

40:08.991 --> 40:11.076
| told you he was
gonna get me killed.

40:11.285 --> 40:13.537
You're not going to die.

40:14.413 --> 40:17.708
You're a good man, Merlin,
a great man,

40:17.791 --> 40:21.169
and one day you're going
to be servant to a great King.

40:22.212 --> 40:25.924
-Now you can still make that happen.
-Thanks to you.

40:30.053 --> 40:33.015
This place has been boring
without you.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.183
Good to see you again.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.645
Yeah, you too.

40:43.984 --> 40:46.486
Merlin.

40:46.570 --> 40:50.032
-Merlin, I'm scared.
-Don't be, it's gonna be all right.

40:52.284 --> 40:54.369
Merlin...

40:57.831 --> 40:59.916
(GASPING)

41:22.397 --> 41:26.860
I'm sorry.
| know he was a close friend.

41:29.321 --> 41:31.323
He still is.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.575
You knew he was a sorcerer,
didn't you?

41:34.493 --> 41:36.578
That's what you were going to tell me.

41:39.164 --> 41:42.459
Yes. It was.

41:43.919 --> 41:46.338
You know how dangerous magic is.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.759
You shouldn't have kept this
from me, Merlin.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.027
You'd better be going.

42:11.405 --> 42:15.075
- Don't have to go.
-Yes, you do.

42:19.371 --> 42:21.665
If anything were to happen to you.

42:21.748 --> 42:23.959
| know where to find you.

42:24.751 --> 42:28.630
You have to go, Merlin.
You belong at Arthur's side.

42:31.174 --> 42:35.721
I've seen how much he needs you,
how much you need him.

42:37.889 --> 42:41.184
You're like two sides
of the same coin.

42:41.268 --> 42:44.312
I've heard someone say that
about us before.

42:45.856 --> 42:48.024
I'm gonna miss you.

42:50.986 --> 42:53.196
I'm going to miss you, too.

42:56.199 --> 43:00.245
When you left,
you were just a boy.

43:02.456 --> 43:06.585
Now look at you.
I'm so proud of you.

43:14.301 --> 43:17.053
When the time is right,

43:17.137 --> 43:20.599
the truth will be known.

43:20.682 --> 43:24.770
Until then,
you must keep your talents hidden.

43:24.853 --> 43:27.022
It's better for everyone.

43:34.613 --> 43:37.365
| am Anhora,
keeper of the unicorns.

43:37.449 --> 43:39.534
MERLIN: Arthur, don't!

43:40.035 --> 43:42.996
ANHORA: When you killed the unicorn,
you unleashed a curse.

43:43.079 --> 43:45.540
For this Camelot
will suffer greatly.

43:45.624 --> 43:48.043
The kingdom is under attack.

43:49.085 --> 43:51.505
-ARTHUR: Undo the curse.
-It is not in my power.

43:53.048 --> 43:55.550
-He will be tested.
-ARTHUR: One of us has to die.

43:55.634 --> 43:57.719
What have you done?
