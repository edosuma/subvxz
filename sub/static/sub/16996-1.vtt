02:22.001 --> 02:25.626
That was tough, the coronary ostia were
damaged too. Well done, professor !

02:25.834 --> 02:27.834
- Thank you, Fratta.
- I was wondering...

02:28.042 --> 02:30.292
maybe next time,
under your supervision...

02:30.501 --> 02:31.792
if you want, I could...

02:32.001 --> 02:34.626
- I don't want. Rosa ?
- Yes, professor ?

02:34.834 --> 02:37.084
Have you found a spot
for the patient in the ICU ?

02:37.292 --> 02:39.167
I'll do it now.

02:39.376 --> 02:43.417
It shouldn't be me to remind you,
try to be more professional if you can.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.959
- Well ?
- Line's busy.

02:50.167 --> 02:54.292
Go ask in person, a good walk
could help you burn a few kilos.

03:02.001 --> 03:03.917
How did it go, professor ?

03:04.126 --> 03:06.917
It was a complex operation,
but a successful one.

03:08.167 --> 03:11.751
The patient is still sedated,
but his heart's responding well.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.667
Thanks, Professor De Luca,
you're a miracle worker.

03:14.876 --> 03:18.626
Miracles don't exist,
I'm an excellent surgeon. Goodbye.

03:31.459 --> 03:33.792
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

03:36.501 --> 03:38.542
Xenia, can't you see
it's nearly empty ?

03:38.751 --> 03:41.917
Mum, please, I'm watching
something important !

03:43.542 --> 03:45.834
Sorry, Bianca.

03:46.042 --> 03:48.292
You take this,
I'll take care of the wine.

04:03.959 --> 04:06.459
Sorry, Carla,
but I haven't eaten all day.

04:06.667 --> 04:09.584
- Help yourself.
- Really tasty though.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.001
We have a new entry here !

04:13.209 --> 04:15.751
That's right ! You noticed then ?

04:15.959 --> 04:19.916
I adopted her last week.
This is Zinza, from Burkina Faso.

04:20.125 --> 04:23.917
Poor thing, not only an orphan,
she's ugly too !

04:25.626 --> 04:27.584
Dinner's in half an hour.

04:31.376 --> 04:34.084
The Plain of Castelluccio
is so amazing.

04:34.292 --> 04:35.917
So peaceful...

04:36.126 --> 04:37.751
- And the lentils !
- Delicious !

04:37.959 --> 04:40.376
- Carla ?
- No, no wine, you know I don't.

04:40.584 --> 04:44.001
You feel at one with the Universe.
Have you ever been, Dad ?

04:44.209 --> 04:49.126
- No.
- Take Mum, she'd love it there.

04:49.334 --> 04:52.292
Andrea, how's it going
with the respiratory diseases ?

04:52.501 --> 04:54.876
Pretty tough.

04:55.084 --> 04:58.001
Tommaso, aren't you friends
with Professor Savarese ?

04:59.042 --> 05:01.792
I don't want to hear
that kind of talk.

05:02.001 --> 05:05.501
Do you want me to call him and say:
"My son hasn't studied

05:05.709 --> 05:08.667
but pass him anyway
because we're friends" ?

05:08.876 --> 05:11.417
We didn't bring them up
with those values.

05:12.292 --> 05:15.209
I didn't mean it like that,
I meant...

05:15.417 --> 05:17.042
Excuse me.

05:17.959 --> 05:20.542
Andrea's very clever,
he'll make us proud.

05:21.584 --> 05:23.584
Right, sweetie ?

05:24.876 --> 05:26.876
Talking about being proud...

05:27.667 --> 05:30.834
did you know Gianni
wrapped up a great sale today ?

05:31.042 --> 05:32.542
Stop it g

05:32.751 --> 05:35.584
- He'd like to...
- If he doesn't want to tell us...

05:35.792 --> 05:37.876
Okay, I'll tell you.

05:38.084 --> 05:40.084
100 square metres,
unauthorized veranda,

05:40.292 --> 05:42.126
fourth floor, no elevator !

05:42.334 --> 05:44.542
Hear that ?
Well done, my love.

05:46.584 --> 05:50.334
I'll get it, Xenia !
Sorry, that's Furio. I have to go.

05:50.542 --> 05:51.917
Drive carefully.

05:56.084 --> 05:58.251
- Hello, Andrea.
- Hey, Furio !

05:58.459 --> 06:02.209
- Have you told your parents yet ?
- Not yet.

06:02.917 --> 06:04.542
Why not ?

06:18.959 --> 06:22.709
Do Bianca and the wimp have to eat
here every night ?

06:22.917 --> 06:26.959
- You know she can't cook.
- I've no idea what she can do !

06:27.167 --> 06:28.917
Don't be like that !

06:29.126 --> 06:31.501
I saw this documentary
about amoebas.

06:31.709 --> 06:35.084
And some of them
are a lot more active than she is.

06:35.876 --> 06:38.001
Listen, about Andrea...

06:38.501 --> 06:39.917
what do you think ?

06:40.126 --> 06:41.626
Why ?

06:41.834 --> 06:43.542
What do you mean ?

06:43.751 --> 06:46.376
I don't know, he's been odd lately.

06:46.584 --> 06:48.459
He's always been peculiar.

06:48.667 --> 06:53.459
As a kid he'd spend all clay
counting ambulances going by !

06:53.667 --> 06:56.042
Yes, and we took him
to a neurologist.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.917
What exactly do you mean...

06:59.126 --> 07:01.167
by Odd ?

07:02.167 --> 07:03.167
Different.

07:03.376 --> 07:06.626
Well, he's probably got a girlfriend.
Good for him! !

07:06.834 --> 07:09.209
Then why is he
with Furio every night ?

07:09.417 --> 07:10.917
They get on well.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.501
Precisely !

07:12.709 --> 07:14.292
What do you mean ?

07:15.584 --> 07:18.001
Let's see if you get it...

07:19.709 --> 07:21.292
He's gay ?

07:21.501 --> 07:23.417
I think so.

07:23.626 --> 07:26.584
- Oh God ! Now what ?
- What ?

07:26.792 --> 07:30.751
Are we still discriminating against
one's sexual orientation ? Come on !

07:30.959 --> 07:33.126
No, of course not !

07:33.792 --> 07:35.959
I totally agree with you.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.042
It might sound like a cliché...

07:42.376 --> 07:44.459
but love is what counts.

07:47.709 --> 07:49.709
You're a big softie then ?

07:51.626 --> 07:53.209
Good night.

07:57.001 --> 07:58.542
Good night.

08:08.209 --> 08:11.042
Rosa, can't you keep up ?
Go on a diet !

08:11.251 --> 08:13.667
I won't operate you
if you have a heart attack.

08:17.542 --> 08:19.667
Good morning !

08:19.876 --> 08:22.792
- How are you feeling ?
- So and so.

08:23.001 --> 08:25.959
- How did you sleep ?
- I was a bit breathless.

08:26.626 --> 08:29.209
Did you expect to run
the New York marathon ?

08:34.042 --> 08:35.542
Right.

08:35.751 --> 08:40.376
Continue the treatment
and add 5 mg of Triatec.

08:42.667 --> 08:45.251
- Goodbye.
- Professor, while you're here...

08:45.459 --> 08:48.251
I've had this pain
for the last two days...

08:48.459 --> 08:50.584
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:52.751 --> 08:55.751
They think I'm their GP!

08:59.334 --> 09:01.834
Did this have to happen right now...

09:02.042 --> 09:04.001
with all the problems we already have ?

09:04.209 --> 09:07.084
- Hello, Carla.
- Tommaso !

09:07.292 --> 09:09.626
- He says he wants to talk to us.
- Who ?

09:09.834 --> 09:13.292
Andrea ! He wants to make
an announcement to the family !

09:14.626 --> 09:16.001
This is it then.

09:16.209 --> 09:19.751
- What shall we do ?
- We have to keep calm. Where is he ?

09:19.959 --> 09:22.626
In his bedroom.
He's waiting for you to get back.

09:22.834 --> 09:25.376
- Bianca and the wretch ?
- At home, they don't know anything.

09:25.584 --> 09:29.251
We'll have to warn them, so they won't
say anything that might hurt him.

09:29.459 --> 09:31.626
- Will you do it ?
- Okay.

09:40.251 --> 09:41.667
Is dinner ready ?

09:47.501 --> 09:49.584
So I just wanted to warn you,

09:49.792 --> 09:53.167
because tonight Andrea's probably
going to tell us he's gay.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.084
Tommaso, I'm so sorry.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.084
What are you doing ?

09:59.292 --> 10:00.792
What's he doing ?

10:01.001 --> 10:03.251
I don't know what to say,
that's terrible news.

10:03.459 --> 10:06.792
No, it's wonderful news !
There's nothing wrong with it.

10:07.709 --> 10:10.167
You're right, but I wouldn't
take it so well.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.542
Dad's right, it's good news.

10:12.751 --> 10:16.459
Dolce and Gabbana's parents
probably weren't happy at first...

10:16.667 --> 10:19.542
- But they made them so proud !
- Bianca, it's an illness !

10:19.751 --> 10:23.126
I know, but there are advantages
of being sick !

10:23.334 --> 10:26.751
Like Dustin Hoffman in that film,
he's a spastic but a genius at cards.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.167
- "The Graduate" ?
- No !

10:29.376 --> 10:31.584
- "Tootsie" ?
- No, come on !

10:31.792 --> 10:35.126
And that short, handsome actor
who's a Jehovah's witness.

10:35.334 --> 10:39.542
- Are you sure I've seen it ?
- That's enough !

10:40.126 --> 10:42.501
Let's go in there now...

10:42.709 --> 10:47.167
and when Andrea makes
his announcement, we'll hug him

10:47.376 --> 10:50.209
and say:
"We're all with you." Okay ?

10:51.417 --> 10:53.417
- "Rain Man".
- That's the one !

11:09.376 --> 11:11.167
I'd like Xenia to be here too.

11:11.376 --> 11:13.334
Xenia's cooking artichokes...

11:13.542 --> 11:15.792
That's no problem, Carla.

11:16.001 --> 11:18.709
If Andrea wants
Xenia to be here too...

11:20.709 --> 11:24.334
In fact, it's only right. After
all these years, she's family too.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.626
- What's up ?
- Come here, Xenia.

11:27.834 --> 11:30.167
Andrea's got something important
to tell us.

11:34.751 --> 11:37.917
Forgive me, I'm a little nervous,
it's hard to find the words.

11:38.126 --> 11:40.876
Darling, everyone here loves you.
Right ?

11:41.084 --> 11:43.126
- Right.
- Hell yeah.

11:43.334 --> 11:45.917
- I hope I won't disappoint you.
- You won't !

11:46.126 --> 11:48.334
Love is all that matters,
as Dad says.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.001
Let's hear him out, Carla !

11:51.876 --> 11:54.042
You're right, Mum.
Love is all that matters.

11:54.251 --> 11:56.459
And my decision
was guided by love.

11:56.667 --> 11:59.334
I have lived a meaningless life
for so long.

11:59.542 --> 12:03.334
I felt I lacked something
and thought: "What's wrong with me ?

12:03.542 --> 12:05.709
Why am I so unhappy ?"

12:06.876 --> 12:10.251
Then one day I met someone
who gave meaning to everything.

12:11.042 --> 12:13.626
And this person is Jesus.

12:13.834 --> 12:17.126
I've decided to become a priest.

12:24.334 --> 12:26.292
I'll go and peel the artichokes.

12:32.376 --> 12:33.792
What do you think, Dad ?

12:49.501 --> 12:50.834
What do I think ?

12:51.042 --> 12:53.417
I'm think that if you're happy...

12:53.959 --> 12:56.042
<i>Dad's happy for you.</i>

12:56.251 --> 12:57.251
What about you, Mum ?

12:58.667 --> 13:00.959
Mum is too, very.

13:02.376 --> 13:04.459
Do we still give him a hug ?

13:17.834 --> 13:19.751
We're all with you.

13:23.209 --> 13:25.084
We're all with you

13:29.417 --> 13:32.917
I have to go now.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

13:33.126 --> 13:34.459
Of course.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.334
But thanks again...

13:39.542 --> 13:41.209
I love you all.

13:43.709 --> 13:46.251
Better than what we thought...

13:49.001 --> 13:50.376
no!

13:50.959 --> 13:52.584
Are you crazy ?

13:52.792 --> 13:55.042
My son, a priest ?
You must be joking !

13:55.251 --> 13:56.917
God doesn't exist...

13:57.126 --> 13:59.167
and even if he did...

13:59.376 --> 14:01.459
which I sincerely doubt...

14:01.667 --> 14:03.834
why throw your life away
being a priest ?

14:04.042 --> 14:07.501
It's an anachronistic profession,
it's like being a chimney sweep !

14:08.334 --> 14:09.626
A knife grinder !

14:10.459 --> 14:12.167
A bagpipe player !

14:12.376 --> 14:15.334
I don't want a son
who's a bagpipe player !

14:15.542 --> 14:19.667
- Calm down, Tommaso...
- But what with calm down, Tommaso ?

14:19.876 --> 14:22.876
We're talking about
the Catholic Church here !

14:23.667 --> 14:27.459
The most obscurantist institution
that ever existed

14:27.667 --> 14:29.459
on the face of the Earth.

14:30.792 --> 14:34.126
Anyhow but the Vatican owns
the best real estate.

14:37.292 --> 14:38.376
Enough.

14:38.584 --> 14:40.084
I'm going to bed.

14:41.209 --> 14:43.834
Dad, wait !
What about the artichokes ?

14:44.042 --> 14:45.417
Good night !

14:48.042 --> 14:50.042
- Xenia ?
- Yes, professor ?

14:51.084 --> 14:53.376
Do you call this an ironed shirt ?

14:54.751 --> 14:57.626
- Is that a trick question ?
- Listen, Xenia...

14:57.834 --> 14:59.417
I've always respected you,

14:59.626 --> 15:02.251
and I've always said that
what Pizarro did to the Incas

15:02.459 --> 15:04.542
was one of the bleakest hours
of history.

15:04.751 --> 15:08.334
But I'm a stickler
for well-ironed shirts. Thank you.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.042
I wouldn't have any coffee
if I were you.

15:21.959 --> 15:24.667
- Carla, we have to do something.
- What ?

15:24.876 --> 15:27.709
I don't know.
Do you want your son to be a priest ?

15:27.917 --> 15:30.001
- If it's what he wants.
- It's madness.

15:30.209 --> 15:31.542
Then tell him.

15:31.751 --> 15:33.917
What if he thinks
I don't like the idea ?

15:34.126 --> 15:37.251
- Why, do you like it ?
- You don't get it !

15:37.459 --> 15:42.709
I can't force him to change his mind,
I have to do it gradually.

15:42.917 --> 15:44.876
I have to make him see reason.

15:45.084 --> 15:47.917
- You talk to him.
- Me ?

15:49.001 --> 15:51.376
I'm always at work,
you have nothing to do.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.417
- Do it when you come home from work.
- No, no, no !

15:56.167 --> 15:57.292
You talk to him.

15:57.501 --> 16:01.501
Instead of adopting other people's
kids, look after your own.

16:05.167 --> 16:07.959
I've had enough,
three years and not one incision !

16:08.167 --> 16:10.709
When will I learn ?
That's enough !

16:10.917 --> 16:13.917
I'll give him a piece of my mind
next time I see him !

16:14.126 --> 16:15.251
Rosa !

16:15.459 --> 16:16.876
Good morning, professor !

16:17.542 --> 16:19.167
Sorry, professor.

16:19.376 --> 16:20.959
Go on, stuff yourself !

16:21.584 --> 16:23.792
When you've finished
guzzling carbohydrates,

16:24.001 --> 16:26.084
bring me Mazzanti's case sheet.

16:26.292 --> 16:27.501
Yes, professor.

16:28.542 --> 16:31.792
Another thing: I don't want
to see her on my ward again.

16:32.001 --> 16:34.542
She provides the patients
with spiritual help !

16:34.751 --> 16:38.959
Don't talk heresy, the patients
have all the help they need.

16:39.167 --> 16:42.417
Is that clear ? I don't want
her around when I'm here.

16:43.459 --> 16:46.834
I'm curious about something,
you become a priest... then what ?

16:47.042 --> 16:48.292
What do you mean ?

16:48.501 --> 16:50.876
I mean, do you go freelance...

16:51.084 --> 16:53.251
do you open your own parish...

16:53.459 --> 16:55.876
Let's say it's more
like a franchising.

16:56.542 --> 16:59.751
Sorry, I'm not well informed
about church business.

16:59.959 --> 17:03.126
Maybe you could explain it to me...

17:03.334 --> 17:05.916
Dad says I never look
into things properly.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.416
You can start by reading
the Gospels.

17:08.626 --> 17:10.834
The Gospel.
There's only one.

17:11.041 --> 17:12.166
No, there are four.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.791
Give me one,
I don't want to overdo it.

17:20.166 --> 17:22.834
- May I ?
- Come in, Mum.

17:27.709 --> 17:29.209
How's everything ?

17:29.417 --> 17:31.042
Much better now.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.834
- Do you feel like talking ?
- Of course.

17:34.042 --> 17:36.167
You gave us some wonderful news...

17:36.376 --> 17:39.542
but we weren't expecting it,
you do realize that ?

17:39.751 --> 17:41.167
Mum, I'm happy.

17:42.084 --> 17:46.001
I can't explain it, but I've finally
found the right path in life.

17:46.209 --> 17:49.709
It's terrible not to have a purpose,
I don't know how you do it.

17:51.959 --> 17:53.376
- Me ?
- Yes.

17:53.584 --> 17:56.834
I've seen you, Mum.
I feel sorry for you.

17:57.042 --> 18:00.167
You pretend to be happy and carefree
but you're depressed.

18:00.376 --> 18:02.417
You're always alone,
doing pointless things.

18:02.626 --> 18:05.417
It's as though
you've given up trying.

18:06.209 --> 18:08.001
Have I hurt you ?

18:09.042 --> 18:10.834
Don't be silly, of course not !

18:40.709 --> 18:42.834
«The Gospel According to St. Matthew.»

18:43.042 --> 18:45.376
<i>«Chapter 1: the book»</i>

18:46.167 --> 18:48.251
«of the generation of Jesus Christ...»

18:48.459 --> 18:51.459
«the son of David, the son of Abraham.»

18:51.667 --> 18:53.417
<i>« Abraham begat Isaac,»</i>

18:53.626 --> 18:55.626
«and Isaac begat Jacob,»

18:55.834 --> 18:58.834
«and Jacob begat Judas»
«and his brethren.»

18:59.042 --> 19:01.126
<i>« And Judas begat Phares...»</i>

19:01.334 --> 19:03.751
«and Zara of Thamar»

19:03.959 --> 19:06.167
«and Phares begat Esrom,»

19:06.376 --> 19:09.084
«and Esrom begat Aram,»

19:09.292 --> 19:11.417
«and Aram begat Amina...»

19:11.959 --> 19:15.792
«..dab,»
«Aminadab begat Naasson...»

19:16.001 --> 19:18.751
Bertocchi, I can't talk right now.
I'm with someone.

19:18.959 --> 19:21.042
I'll call you back. Thank you.

19:22.042 --> 19:23.042
Well ?

19:26.084 --> 19:27.292
Have you been drinking ?

19:28.751 --> 19:30.084
No!

19:30.292 --> 19:31.542
Did you talk to Andrea ?

19:34.876 --> 19:37.084
Tommaso, my life has no meaning.

19:40.334 --> 19:42.334
«Jechonias begat Salathiel,»

19:42.542 --> 19:45.126
«and Salathiel begat Zorobabel,»

19:46.459 --> 19:49.376
«and Zorobabel begat Abiud,»

19:49.584 --> 19:52.542
«and Abiud begat Eliakim,»

19:53.417 --> 19:56.626
«and Eliakim begat Azor,»

19:57.209 --> 19:59.917
<i>«and Azor begat Sadoc,»</i>

20:00.126 --> 20:02.542
«and Sadoc begat Achim...»

20:13.667 --> 20:16.834
"All the ends of the earth
will remember.

20:17.042 --> 20:20.001
And all the families of the Gentiles
will adore in his sight,

20:20.209 --> 20:23.876
for the kingdom belongs to the Lord,
and he will have dominion,

20:24.084 --> 20:28.042
in his sight they will fall down,
all those who descend to the ground."

20:39.084 --> 20:42.751
- What is it, Dad ? Be quick !
- I need to talk to you.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.834
- You know your brother...
- Andrea ?

20:45.042 --> 20:47.459
You've only got one !
Focus, Bianca !

20:47.667 --> 20:51.292
I need your help.
Do you know what's going on ?

20:51.501 --> 20:52.626
Right now ?

20:52.834 --> 20:55.792
I've downloaded "Jesus of Nazareth",
it's so exciting !

20:56.001 --> 20:59.167
- Zeffirelli's film ?
- Don't tell me how it ends !

20:59.959 --> 21:01.751
Why are you watching it ?

21:01.959 --> 21:05.542
Andrea lent me the Gospels,
but I couldn't get into it.

21:05.751 --> 21:08.501
Sorry, they're leading him to Pilate.
Come on !

21:09.126 --> 21:10.667
Oh God, poor thing !

21:34.042 --> 21:37.376
- Good morning.
- Hello, how can I help you ?

21:38.126 --> 21:40.834
Tommaso, how nice to see you !

21:41.417 --> 21:42.792
I'll take care of this.

21:43.417 --> 21:44.876
Come here !

21:45.917 --> 21:48.376
You'd never guess
but she has a degree in Psychology.

21:48.584 --> 21:50.584
Yes, I got that impression.

21:51.542 --> 21:54.667
I'm glad you've come by.
At last !

21:54.876 --> 21:57.376
Would you like a coffee,
tea, cocktail snack...

21:57.584 --> 21:59.501
No, nothing, thanks.

21:59.709 --> 22:02.126
Listen, Gianni,
I'll get straight to the point.

22:02.334 --> 22:06.251
Over the years you may have
thought that I despised you.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.251
- No !
- And you'd be right !

22:08.667 --> 22:11.834
But I've got a problem,
and I don't know who to turn to.

22:12.042 --> 22:15.959
Tommaso, I'm here to help,
anything you need, you know...

22:16.167 --> 22:17.417
It's Andrea.

22:17.626 --> 22:19.709
This vocation of his makes no sense.

22:19.917 --> 22:22.459
I think he's just a bit confused.

22:22.667 --> 22:23.959
I don't know what to do.

22:24.167 --> 22:26.167
Let's go over everything...

22:26.376 --> 22:29.001
In the past has Andrea...

22:29.209 --> 22:33.584
ever shown any interest
in religious matters, like the Pope ?

22:34.876 --> 22:36.751
Padre Pio ?

22:37.501 --> 22:39.459
The Nativity scene ?

22:40.292 --> 22:42.167
- Nuns ?
- No, never.

22:42.376 --> 22:45.501
So it's a recent thing. I reckon
he's keeping bad company.

22:45.709 --> 22:48.417
Do you know
what Andrea does at night ?

22:48.626 --> 22:49.751
Where he goes ?

22:49.959 --> 22:51.792
Who he hangs out with ?

22:52.751 --> 22:56.042
«The life cycle of this dust mite»
«is rather unusual.»

22:56.251 --> 22:58.709
Tommaso, you and I need to talk.

22:58.917 --> 22:59.917
Go ahead !

23:00.126 --> 23:03.584
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I've not been happy lately.

23:06.167 --> 23:09.251
Can we turn the TV off, please ?

23:13.001 --> 23:14.167
Tell me.

23:14.376 --> 23:17.334
The other day I realized
I cannot carry on this way.

23:18.209 --> 23:19.917
I'm going out, bye !

23:20.126 --> 23:21.459
Bye, Andrea.

23:22.417 --> 23:24.001
The kids have grown up,

23:24.209 --> 23:27.376
you have your work, which you love,
but what do I have ?

23:27.584 --> 23:31.126
It's as though no one's interested
in what I do or say !

23:41.417 --> 23:42.501
I'm ready !

25:13.084 --> 25:14.834
That's enough !

25:15.917 --> 25:19.417
Enough, or I'll get big-headed
and want to be Pope !

25:20.084 --> 25:22.792
Right, last time we got to

25:23.001 --> 25:25.876
the multiplication
of the loaves and fishes.

25:26.084 --> 25:28.917
Location: the splendid
Lake Tiberias.

25:29.126 --> 25:33.459
Cast: you know the leading man,
he never changes, Jesus,

25:33.667 --> 25:36.001
the disciples,
and a crowd of people,

25:36.209 --> 25:39.584
but not ordinary people,
people of every kind,

25:39.792 --> 25:43.084
mutilated, crippled, blind, paralytic,
in short, a funny crowd.

25:44.334 --> 25:46.501
And they were hungry to boot !

25:46.709 --> 25:50.876
And Jesus said: "Let's feed them,
we can't let them go hungry."

25:51.084 --> 25:53.751
But the disciples were
embarrassed and said:

25:53.959 --> 25:58.042
"All we have left are five loaves
and two fishes.

25:58.251 --> 26:00.626
If we'd known before,
we'd have gone for grocery !"

26:01.376 --> 26:03.209
What a cool priest !

26:03.417 --> 26:07.084
So Jesus said: "That's no problem,
leave it to me."

26:45.709 --> 26:47.584
What can I tell you ?

26:47.792 --> 26:51.626
There's not much difference
between us and those wretches.

26:51.834 --> 26:54.792
Think about it,
we are lacking something too.

26:55.001 --> 26:57.751
Maybe not an arm or a leg...

26:57.959 --> 27:02.376
but sometimes it's worse
not to have any hope or dreams.

27:02.584 --> 27:06.959
So, if you are hungry
like those poor wretches,

27:07.167 --> 27:08.459
then take my advice...

27:08.667 --> 27:10.459
give Jesus a try.

27:10.667 --> 27:13.917
Taste his words,
the way my friend Andrea did.

27:15.584 --> 27:18.001
And you will realize
you'll want for nothing.

27:18.209 --> 27:20.459
It's late, I need some sleep.

27:20.667 --> 27:23.167
See you next time.
Bye, and thanks.

27:35.584 --> 27:37.834
I don't like this Father Pietro.

27:38.042 --> 27:41.292
The way he moves and talks...
he's like a guru.

27:41.501 --> 27:44.126
And he's brainwashed my son.

27:44.334 --> 27:47.126
Find something out,
then I can talk to Andrea

27:47.334 --> 27:48.834
and put a stop to it.

27:49.501 --> 27:53.709
The police chief is a friend of mine,
but I don't want to ask him.

27:53.917 --> 27:55.501
Don't worry, Tommaso.

27:55.709 --> 27:57.917
Pizzuti is a very discreet person.

27:58.126 --> 28:00.459
I can vouch for him,
he's worked for me for years.

28:00.667 --> 28:03.751
Bankruptcies, repossessions...
a real sleuth.

28:03.959 --> 28:06.001
I'm just doing my job.

28:07.709 --> 28:10.001
Forgive me, it's an important call.

28:10.209 --> 28:12.417
Dr. Finocchiaro, good morning !

28:12.626 --> 28:14.751
How is Mr. Lucci ?

28:15.542 --> 28:17.042
BARE OWNERSHIP SALES

28:17.334 --> 28:18.917
What ? Much better ?

28:19.792 --> 28:22.292
He was on his deathbed yesterday !

28:24.501 --> 28:27.001
You're puzzled about it too...

28:27.209 --> 28:29.334
All right, doctor. Keep me posted.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.792
The age is right. Fingers crossed.

28:37.126 --> 28:38.334
Where were we ?

28:41.501 --> 28:43.126
What's up ? Are you crazy ?

28:43.334 --> 28:47.126
I was thinking about our happy
memories in the last ten years.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.792
- And ?
- I couldn't think of a single one !

28:50.001 --> 28:52.001
You've ruined my life !

28:52.209 --> 28:53.251
What's happened ?

28:53.459 --> 28:56.959
He doesn't know !
He never does.

28:57.167 --> 28:59.459
What is there to know ?

28:59.959 --> 29:02.292
You are a selfish and horrible man !

29:02.501 --> 29:04.959
I was a fantastic person
when we met.

29:05.167 --> 29:08.501
- Look what you've done to me !
- Will you calm down, please ?

29:08.709 --> 29:11.876
Yes, we mustn't lose face.
That's all that matters to you !

29:12.084 --> 29:13.876
You've become so middle class !

29:14.084 --> 29:17.667
Worse than those people
we despised when we were 20 !

29:19.084 --> 29:21.209
I don't want to stay
with a man like that.

29:21.417 --> 29:23.334
Enough!

29:27.667 --> 29:29.959
- What are you doing ?
- Leave me alone.

29:32.251 --> 29:35.417
- Where are you going ?
- To live in Xenia's room.

29:44.834 --> 29:47.834
Professor, please make up,
it's a very tiny room.

30:15.209 --> 30:16.334
Well ?

30:16.542 --> 30:20.334
You were right. Fr. Pietro
is a very shady character.

30:20.542 --> 30:22.334
Did you find something out ?

30:24.876 --> 30:26.501
Not here.

30:36.917 --> 30:38.209
Not bad, eh ?

30:38.417 --> 30:40.001
Explain them to me.

30:41.167 --> 30:42.917
Look at this.

30:44.417 --> 30:46.459
What do you see ?

30:46.667 --> 30:49.084
- He's posting a letter.
- That's right.

30:49.292 --> 30:51.667
But the question is: who to ?

30:51.876 --> 30:53.001
Who to ?

30:53.209 --> 30:55.917
I don't know yet,
but it seems a good lead.

30:56.959 --> 30:58.251
And this one ?

30:58.459 --> 31:01.626
Have you ever seen a priest
using a cashpoint ?

31:01.834 --> 31:03.292
I haven't.

31:04.792 --> 31:07.167
This is the most interesting one.

31:08.917 --> 31:12.501
You may say: "So what ?
He's going into a pharmacy."

31:12.709 --> 31:15.459
But you can buy
a lot in a pharmacy.

31:15.667 --> 31:19.501
Medicine, shampoo, but also...

31:20.709 --> 31:21.917
syringes !

31:22.584 --> 31:25.792
- Get out of here, Pizzuti !
- But we're getting somewhere...

31:26.001 --> 31:28.001
- Get out !
- Let me explain...

31:28.209 --> 31:29.292
Out !

31:33.417 --> 31:35.917
Could you give me an advance ?
I'm broke...

31:36.126 --> 31:37.959
Out !

32:07.709 --> 32:09.751
- Photogenic, isn't he ?
- Is that him ?

32:09.959 --> 32:11.626
That's him, that's him !

32:11.834 --> 32:15.126
"Pietro Pellegrini,
several charges of robbery,

32:15.334 --> 32:17.542
scams and aggravated fraud.

32:17.751 --> 32:20.334
He discovered the faith
through the prison chaplain.

32:20.542 --> 32:23.917
He went straight to the seminary
when he left jail.

32:24.126 --> 32:26.292
Why are you interested
in this priest ?

32:26.501 --> 32:29.042
It's a long story,
I'll tell you some other time.

32:30.084 --> 32:32.584
Stefania and I are having
a house warming on Saturday.

32:32.792 --> 32:35.084
- Tell Carla, we'll see you there.
- Yes.

32:35.292 --> 32:38.751
Isn't it strange that a
man like him would drop everything

32:38.959 --> 32:40.251
and become a priest ?

32:40.459 --> 32:44.417
Yes, it is strange, but until
proved otherwise he's clean.

32:44.626 --> 32:47.251
Yes, until proved otherwise...

32:49.001 --> 32:50.209
Thank you.

32:53.084 --> 32:55.959
Sorry for the late notice
but I'm going away tomorrow.

32:56.167 --> 32:57.917
For two weeks.

32:58.126 --> 33:00.376
- Where are you going ?
- Camaldoli Hermitage.

33:00.584 --> 33:03.417
A retreat for young men
who want to be priests.

33:05.584 --> 33:09.084
I thought you had an exam next week ?

33:10.501 --> 33:11.834
Yes, Dad...

33:12.042 --> 33:15.126
but seeing I can't do both things,

33:15.334 --> 33:18.584
I've been thinking
of dropping out of med school.

33:21.376 --> 33:23.459
- What's wrong ?
- Dad !

33:24.209 --> 33:27.209
- Darling !
- Tommaso, look at the little birdie !

33:27.959 --> 33:29.334
Look at the birdie !

33:29.792 --> 33:32.001
Have a sip, Dad.

33:34.792 --> 33:37.834
I'm okay now.
Don't worry.

33:38.042 --> 33:39.876
No one was worried.

33:40.459 --> 33:44.876
Andrea, what's this hermitage like ?
Like a holiday farm ?

33:45.084 --> 33:49.792
- No, it's a monastery !
- Great ! I'd love to go there.

33:50.001 --> 33:51.709
Let's go one weekend.

33:51.917 --> 33:54.292
- Do they have wifi ?
- I don't know.

33:54.501 --> 33:57.084
Fr. Pietro's organized it,
he's a priest friend.

33:58.501 --> 34:00.001
A very special person.

34:00.209 --> 34:02.334
- Really ?
- Yes, he helps everyone.

34:02.542 --> 34:05.667
Whatever problem you have,
financial, family, he'll help you !

34:05.876 --> 34:07.751
That's nice !

34:07.959 --> 34:09.376
I'm very fond of him.

34:09.583 --> 34:12.501
It's thanks to him
I found my vocation.

34:15.042 --> 34:16.583
Come in, Dad.

34:20.376 --> 34:22.042
Listen, Andrea...

34:22.917 --> 34:26.292
we haven't discussed
this matter yet...

34:27.708 --> 34:32.751
but I think it's time I told you
what I think of your vocation.

34:32.958 --> 34:34.667
I already know.

34:35.792 --> 34:38.083
- You do ?
- Yes.

34:38.292 --> 34:40.458
I am so happy to have your support.

34:41.251 --> 34:44.292
I was afraid you wouldn't approve,
but you've been great.

34:44.501 --> 34:46.292
As usual !

34:48.042 --> 34:49.626
I feel like crying.

34:50.626 --> 34:52.126
That makes two of us.

34:53.376 --> 34:55.583
«For the sake»
«of His sorrowful passion...»

34:55.792 --> 34:59.251
«Have mercy on us,»
«and on the whole world.»

34:59.459 --> 35:01.376
«For his sorrowful passion...»

35:01.584 --> 35:05.084
«Have mercy on us»
«and on the whole world.»

35:15.459 --> 35:17.542
Darling, I'll go and get a glass...

35:27.126 --> 35:29.292
Well, how did it go ?

35:29.501 --> 35:31.167
Terrible.

35:31.376 --> 35:34.001
I have to make the most
of these next two weeks

35:34.209 --> 35:36.709
to prove that this priest
is a rogue.

35:36.917 --> 35:39.209
- How will you do that ?
- I don't know.

35:39.417 --> 35:41.334
I need an idea.

35:41.542 --> 35:43.334
Shall I call Pizzuti ?

35:47.959 --> 35:49.417
Was that a no ?

35:49.626 --> 35:52.709
That evening, when Jesus finished
praying, he went to his disciples

35:52.917 --> 35:56.209
and they... they were fast asleep !

35:56.417 --> 35:59.417
You're laughing because you think
we're better than them.

35:59.626 --> 36:02.292
But we're not.
We think we are awake

36:02.501 --> 36:06.459
because we eat, work, chat, and
fill our lives with pointless things.

36:07.251 --> 36:09.459
But the truth is we are sleeping too.

36:10.167 --> 36:12.084
And we don't realize it.

36:14.292 --> 36:18.084
But we'll discuss that next week.
Go to bed now, good night.

36:18.501 --> 36:20.001
Thanks.

36:34.376 --> 36:36.292
- Fr. Pietro ?
- Yes ?

36:36.501 --> 36:39.084
I'm desperate, I'm unemployed...

36:39.292 --> 36:43.459
- Bye, Fr. Pietro !
- Later. Say hello to Cesarone.

36:43.667 --> 36:45.584
- You were saying ?
- Forgive me...

36:45.792 --> 36:49.542
I'm desperate, I'm unemployed,
I have problems at home...

36:49.751 --> 36:52.501
- I have a retarded brother...
- How are you, professor ?

36:52.709 --> 36:55.042
- I'll be right back.
- Do you come here too ?

36:56.292 --> 36:59.209
Fratta, you don't know me,
you've never seen me, okay ?

36:59.417 --> 37:02.417
- But, professor...
- If you tell anyone...

37:02.626 --> 37:05.751
I'll have you kicked out
of the hospital, so be warned.

37:05.959 --> 37:08.042
- Okay.
- Have a good evening.

37:19.542 --> 37:20.709
Having problems ?

37:20.917 --> 37:22.376
No, no.

37:23.209 --> 37:24.501
Yes !

37:24.709 --> 37:26.459
Yes, lots of them.

37:27.251 --> 37:29.584
I'm desperate, I'm unemployed,

37:29.792 --> 37:31.792
I support my retarded brother,

37:32.001 --> 37:35.126
my wife had a nervous breakdown
and beats me.

37:35.751 --> 37:38.334
- Nothing else ?
- I want to kill myself.

37:38.542 --> 37:42.542
- I'm not surprised.
- I need some spiritual solace.

37:42.751 --> 37:45.542
I want us to get to know
each other better.

37:46.709 --> 37:48.001
What's your name ?

37:50.417 --> 37:52.209
You can't even remember ?

37:52.417 --> 37:55.792
It's with all these problems...
Mauro !

37:56.001 --> 37:59.001
Mauro, go and get some sleep,
it's late !

37:59.209 --> 38:02.084
- I said I want to kill myself.
- Right now ?

38:02.292 --> 38:04.376
- No...
- No !

38:04.584 --> 38:08.792
Okay, come and see me tomorrow,
we'll have a chat.

38:09.001 --> 38:11.084
Via del Crepaccio, 12.

38:15.459 --> 38:17.417
See ya !

39:01.584 --> 39:03.626
- Sorry, did it hit you ?
- No...

39:04.334 --> 39:06.751
This is the church
my mother used to come to.

39:06.959 --> 39:09.959
I lived nearby when I was a kid,
so I'm doing it up,

39:10.167 --> 39:12.459
bit by bit,
when I'm not in my parish.

39:14.584 --> 39:16.459
- Can you paint ?
- No.

39:16.667 --> 39:19.376
Too bad, you could've
given me a hand.

39:21.042 --> 39:23.251
What was your name again ?

39:26.084 --> 39:27.209
Mauro !

39:27.917 --> 39:30.917
You need to take
something for your memory !

39:31.126 --> 39:33.001
You worry me.

39:33.667 --> 39:35.792
- How are you feeling today ?
- Bad.

39:36.001 --> 39:37.167
Terrible.

39:37.376 --> 39:40.209
It's getting worse.
I think of suicide every day.

39:40.417 --> 39:43.501
Don't, life is not yours,
you can't do as you like !

39:43.709 --> 39:46.459
I know, but I'm broke.

39:46.667 --> 39:49.876
I don't know where to turn,
I'm willing to do anything.

39:52.042 --> 39:53.626
Even steal.

40:00.917 --> 40:02.126
What do you say ?

40:02.334 --> 40:04.584
What can I say ?

40:04.792 --> 40:07.876
I'm desperate...
what would you do if you were me ?

40:13.167 --> 40:14.792
Just a sec.

40:17.834 --> 40:19.376
Federico !

40:19.584 --> 40:22.292
Darn it... Never mind,
we'll meet Saturday.

40:23.001 --> 40:24.667
Remember the clams !

40:24.876 --> 40:26.959
Bye, buddy.

40:28.376 --> 40:32.126
But you don't look that desperate,
that suit must be worth 1,200.

40:33.209 --> 40:34.417
This ?

40:35.084 --> 40:38.584
No, it's second-hand.
I got it from charity.

40:38.792 --> 40:41.542
Good, that chair's still wet !

40:48.209 --> 40:51.459
- Want a bite ? It's good.
- No, thanks.

40:52.626 --> 40:55.292
How long have you been a priest ?

40:55.501 --> 40:57.417
Ten years, late-onset vocation.

40:58.084 --> 41:02.709
- What's it like being a priest ?
- Working on Sundays sucks...

41:04.042 --> 41:05.917
I'm just kidding !

41:08.001 --> 41:11.001
How come you know
how much this suit costs ?

41:11.209 --> 41:15.042
I used to like smart clothes once...

41:15.251 --> 41:17.167
- What did you do before ?
- Lots of things.

41:17.376 --> 41:19.001
- For example ?
- Various jobs...

41:19.209 --> 41:21.501
- Such as ?
- Are you a cop ?

41:21.709 --> 41:24.001
Me ? Of course not !

41:24.209 --> 41:25.959
All right...

41:27.417 --> 41:30.459
I don't remember seeing you
at the meetings.

41:30.667 --> 41:33.334
- Have you been coming long ?
- No.

41:33.542 --> 41:36.417
No, it was my first time.

41:36.626 --> 41:38.751
- They spoke so highly of you...
- Who did ?

41:42.126 --> 41:43.834
Never mind.

41:44.042 --> 41:46.584
You don't even remember
your own name...

41:46.792 --> 41:50.542
- Are you a believer though ?
- Yes ! Very much so !

41:50.751 --> 41:52.876
Then take my advice and pray.

41:53.084 --> 41:56.376
It's essential to pray,
you must never tire of praying.

41:56.584 --> 41:58.584
- Are you busy right now ?
- No.

41:58.792 --> 42:02.876
- Let's go and pray together.
- Don't you have to paint the church ?

42:03.084 --> 42:05.709
Don't worry, I'll do it later.
Come on !

42:05.917 --> 42:07.501
Darn it...

42:11.876 --> 42:15.542
Next week we want to organize
a joint meeting...

42:15.751 --> 42:18.251
with representatives
of some high schools

42:18.459 --> 42:22.834
to prepare a report to send
to the Ministry of Education.

42:23.042 --> 42:24.417
I'll let you know.

42:24.626 --> 42:29.001
But now we have the solidarity
of a former student.

42:29.209 --> 42:31.042
I'll let her speak.

42:31.251 --> 42:32.959
Thank you.

42:34.334 --> 42:36.417
Hello, everyone, my name's Carla.

42:36.626 --> 42:40.042
It feels strange to be back
in this school

42:40.251 --> 42:42.334
after all these years.

42:42.542 --> 42:45.001
My children attended
this school too...

42:45.209 --> 42:49.709
or rather one of them,
the other chose a different school...

42:50.626 --> 42:52.292
Okay then...

42:52.501 --> 42:55.876
I am here today
to express my solidarity

42:56.084 --> 42:57.542
and support,

42:57.751 --> 43:00.459
but also to give you
some heartfelt advice.

43:01.042 --> 43:03.709
Student collectives are fine,
so are meetings,

43:03.917 --> 43:07.334
and joint reports, but they are
sometimes not enough.

43:07.542 --> 43:10.209
Because there are people
who just won't listen.

43:10.417 --> 43:13.626
If you think someone's interested
in you for what you are,

43:13.834 --> 43:16.042
and what you have inside,
you're wrong.

43:16.251 --> 43:18.584
No one's listening to you,
they don't care.

43:18.792 --> 43:20.834
It's as though you don't exist.

43:21.042 --> 43:24.209
So show them you exist,
but do it now,

43:24.417 --> 43:27.917
because soon it will be too late,
and you'll regret it all your life.

43:28.126 --> 43:31.001
No more talk, let's take action !

43:31.209 --> 43:33.126
Let's occupy !

43:49.584 --> 43:51.917
Rosa, that's mine.
See who it is.

43:52.542 --> 43:54.001
Hurry up.

43:54.209 --> 43:55.834
It says "priest".

43:56.042 --> 43:57.667
Come closer.

43:58.542 --> 43:59.584
Hello ?

43:59.792 --> 44:02.876
Come straight here,
Via delle Sette Chiese, 101.

44:03.084 --> 44:05.251
«I can't right now, I'm busy.»

44:05.459 --> 44:07.542
Knock it off,
you've got nothing to do.

44:10.542 --> 44:12.084
«Are you there ?»

44:12.959 --> 44:15.167
«- What's going on ?»
- Found you a little job.

44:17.042 --> 44:18.209
What kind ?

44:18.417 --> 44:22.001
A friend of mine wants someone bright.
You said you'd do anything...

44:22.209 --> 44:23.834
«- Yes.»
- Well ?

44:24.042 --> 44:25.167
I'm coming.

44:28.834 --> 44:31.459
Fratta, I have to go.
Can you take over here ?

44:32.042 --> 44:33.501
Me?

44:33.709 --> 44:35.876
Remember to replace the valve,

44:36.084 --> 44:38.584
or the patient won't survive
the operation.

44:38.792 --> 44:40.417
Good luck !

44:48.417 --> 44:49.876
Fr. Pietro ?

44:50.084 --> 44:52.751
- About time !
- I waited ages for the bus.

44:52.959 --> 44:57.126
Said doesn't trust people he doesn't
know, but I persuaded him.

44:57.334 --> 44:59.251
But don't show me up.

45:00.334 --> 45:03.667
By the way, are you
any good with a knife ?

45:06.376 --> 45:09.001
Not too bad, why ?

45:13.709 --> 45:15.876
- Who's next ?
- Me.

45:16.084 --> 45:17.792
Two euros with potatoes.

45:18.001 --> 45:20.667
- Two euros precisely ?
- Two euros.

45:36.334 --> 45:38.084
Have faith, Said.

45:45.959 --> 45:48.417
Does he think
he's performing surgery ?

45:52.834 --> 45:54.667
79!

45:54.876 --> 45:57.042
Can I have a piece with mushrooms ?

45:57.251 --> 45:59.501
Not the edge,
it's always a bit burnt.

45:59.709 --> 46:02.751
And not the middle,
it doesn't look very cooked,

46:02.959 --> 46:04.334
I'll get indigestion.

46:04.959 --> 46:07.292
No, I'll have it
with courgettes instead.

46:07.501 --> 46:10.417
I hope you've put more salt
in it today.

46:13.251 --> 46:14.501
What are you doing ?

46:14.709 --> 46:16.709
Cheese and tomato will be fine.

46:16.917 --> 46:19.376
Here's the knife, cut your own.

46:24.376 --> 46:26.376
I ask a friend for a favour,

46:26.584 --> 46:29.751
I find you a job,
which isn't easy right now,

46:29.959 --> 46:31.792
and you walk out ?

46:32.001 --> 46:35.251
I know, but there was
an emergency at home...

46:35.459 --> 46:36.917
Pietro !

46:37.792 --> 46:39.792
Take a walk, I'm busy.

46:41.167 --> 46:42.501
Hello, Fr. Pietro.

46:42.709 --> 46:46.042
- Got the money ?
- Yes, but I wanted to ask...

46:46.251 --> 46:48.501
- Hand it over !
- Why are you so aggressive ?

46:48.709 --> 46:50.876
- You do this every week !
- Wait.

46:51.084 --> 46:54.626
- What is it ?
- I didn't get as much this week.

46:59.834 --> 47:02.001
Make this last all week.

47:02.209 --> 47:03.834
- Go now.
- This ?

47:04.042 --> 47:06.626
Go home, take my advice.

47:11.084 --> 47:12.751
- Who was that ?
- A friend.

47:12.959 --> 47:15.334
- What did he want ?
- What do you care ?

47:17.251 --> 47:19.126
I was just curious.

47:19.334 --> 47:23.084
- What happened at home ?
- An emergency. You know how it is.

47:23.292 --> 47:25.334
Burnt out wife, retarded brother...

47:25.542 --> 47:28.876
Yes, I wouldn't have turned down
that job otherwise.

47:29.084 --> 47:31.126
You can't carry on like this.

47:31.334 --> 47:33.417
I know, so tell me what I should do.

47:33.626 --> 47:35.417
Tell me !

47:35.626 --> 47:37.917
Okay, I tell you what...

47:38.126 --> 47:40.792
I'll come to your place on Friday
and meet them.

47:41.584 --> 47:43.917
- To my home ?
- Yes. What's your address ?

47:46.584 --> 47:47.626
What did you say ?

47:47.834 --> 47:50.251
That I'd send him a text
when I remembered.

47:50.459 --> 47:52.042
Brilliant !

47:52.251 --> 47:55.376
I couldn't invite him
to my penthouse in Prati.

47:55.584 --> 47:58.542
Can you find me a dreary,
dingy apartment ?

47:58.751 --> 48:01.959
It's not easy,
I deal in luxury real estate.

48:02.167 --> 48:04.292
Does it have to be very dingy ?

48:04.501 --> 48:05.959
Absolutely.

48:06.167 --> 48:08.542
Then my place is perfect.

48:08.751 --> 48:11.751
Tommaso, forgive me.
It is worth all this trouble ?

48:11.959 --> 48:13.792
For your own sake,

48:14.001 --> 48:17.292
you're a well-known surgeon,
what if people find out ?

48:17.501 --> 48:20.667
This criminal has brainwashed
my son !

48:20.876 --> 48:25.126
And it's all a cover.
He's got this money racket going.

48:25.334 --> 48:28.084
I need to show my son
he's a rogue.

48:29.167 --> 48:31.334
We'll use Pizzuti's home,

48:31.542 --> 48:36.084
you can be my retarded brother,
that shouldn't be too hard...

48:36.292 --> 48:38.709
- I could be a handicapped relative.
- No need.

48:38.917 --> 48:41.001
Your secretary can be my wife.

48:41.209 --> 48:43.834
Patrizia, who's not here right now...

48:44.042 --> 48:48.042
- She's in a clinic.
- I'm sorry about that. An accident ?

48:48.251 --> 48:51.001
- No, liposuction on her buttocks.
- Darn it !

48:51.209 --> 48:53.542
- It's a routine op.
- Who cares !

48:53.751 --> 48:56.167
Where will I find another wife ?

49:03.251 --> 49:06.709
- There's no sugar in it.
- No, drink it.

49:06.917 --> 49:09.709
I don't want to interrupt
your coffee break.

49:11.667 --> 49:13.542
I said drink it!

49:15.209 --> 49:18.501
Listen, Rosa, I need to ask you
a little favor.

49:18.709 --> 49:21.876
- For friendship's sake.
- Yes, professor.

49:22.084 --> 49:24.667
I can't explain it
to you right now,

49:24.876 --> 49:27.501
but I will clarify everything later.

49:27.709 --> 49:30.959
On Friday afternoon,
for a couple of hours,

49:31.167 --> 49:33.542
I want you to pretend
to be my wife.

49:34.084 --> 49:35.792
What do you mean ?

49:36.001 --> 49:37.917
I... how can I ?

49:38.126 --> 49:40.209
No, I don't feel up to it.

49:40.417 --> 49:42.251
What must I do ?

49:42.459 --> 49:45.626
I've told you,
pretend to be my wife.

49:46.376 --> 49:48.376
But be a little aggressive.

49:49.042 --> 49:52.876
In fact, to be honest,
you have to ill-treat me.

49:54.834 --> 49:57.001
What time are we meeting ?

49:59.084 --> 50:01.292
- Where are you going, Dad ?
- I have to go out.

50:01.501 --> 50:03.751
Andrea will be back
from his retreat soon.

50:03.959 --> 50:07.626
It would be nice if we were all here
for a family prayer.

50:07.834 --> 50:11.167
- Do it with your mother.
- She's at the student's union.

50:11.376 --> 50:13.751
Where ? No, never mind.

50:14.376 --> 50:16.292
Come on, Dad, stay here !

50:16.501 --> 50:18.626
We'll recite the rosary
while we wait!

50:44.042 --> 50:46.459
- What's with the dead smell ?
- Quiet !

50:52.042 --> 50:54.667
- And you live here, Pizzuti ?
- Yes.

50:55.584 --> 50:58.126
Well, I'm staying with
my ex-wife right now.

50:59.626 --> 51:03.459
A small problem with the courts,
but it'll be sorted out soon.

51:06.542 --> 51:08.042
This way.

51:11.709 --> 51:13.667
What did I tell you ?
It's perfect !

51:15.167 --> 51:17.376
It's a bit stuffy,
let's open the windows...

51:18.167 --> 51:19.584
We'd better not.

51:19.792 --> 51:22.126
You know how it is, the neighbours...

51:22.334 --> 51:24.084
People can be mean.

51:24.292 --> 51:26.667
Rosa, there are some teacups
over there.

51:27.667 --> 51:31.542
I'll grab a couple of shirts
and underpants before I go.

51:35.459 --> 51:39.167
Tommaso, I've been working
on the retarded brother act.

51:46.917 --> 51:50.501
- I have another version too...
- No, the first one's fine.

51:50.709 --> 51:52.709
Rosa, understand
what you have to do ?

51:52.917 --> 51:55.917
- Yes, professor.
- No, don't call me that !

51:56.126 --> 51:59.334
Today I'm Mauro, your husband
and you have to ill-treat me.

51:59.542 --> 52:02.376
- I'll try, but I'm not sure I...
- You have to !

52:02.584 --> 52:05.001
I'll be off.
Here are the keys.

52:05.209 --> 52:07.376
Thanks, Pizzuti, you're the best.

52:07.584 --> 52:08.876
You're welcome.

52:09.709 --> 52:12.792
- Who's that now ?
- Probably the municipal police !

52:13.001 --> 52:15.209
My damn neighbour must've called them.

52:17.834 --> 52:21.459
- It's okay, it's Fr. Pietro.
- What will you do now ?

52:21.667 --> 52:24.084
Open it, don't worry.
Leave it to me.

52:28.626 --> 52:30.292
What are you doing ?

52:36.501 --> 52:38.459
- May I ?
- Fr. Pietro !

52:38.667 --> 52:40.292
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

52:40.501 --> 52:42.501
Let me introduce my family.

52:43.501 --> 52:46.084
- This is my wife Rosa.
- Hello.

52:46.751 --> 52:47.917
My brother Gianni.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.376
Yes.

52:51.584 --> 52:53.084
And this is...

52:55.792 --> 52:58.792
- Pizzuti ! His brother-in-law.
- Nice to meet you.

52:59.001 --> 53:01.126
A little floral gift, madam.

53:01.334 --> 53:05.084
Thank you ! Look and learn !
This asshole never buys me presents !

53:07.792 --> 53:09.376
This way, everyone.

53:13.292 --> 53:15.334
Let's sit down.

53:22.459 --> 53:24.209
How are you, Gianni ?

53:25.376 --> 53:27.626
Fine ! How long
has he been like this ?

53:27.834 --> 53:31.834
- He was born that way.
- But he's improved lately.

53:32.751 --> 53:34.626
- Biscuit ?
- No, thanks.

53:34.834 --> 53:38.167
Yes, all he thinks about
is eating, the pig !

53:40.376 --> 53:43.292
Easy, violence doesn't pay.

53:43.501 --> 53:45.376
Sorry, I got worked up.

53:45.917 --> 53:47.542
Isn't Gianni drinking ?

53:47.751 --> 53:50.334
I'll help him. Drink up, dear boy.

53:54.251 --> 53:55.834
It's a little hot.

53:58.459 --> 54:01.792
- Am I doing okay, professor ?
- Yes, maybe just a little less...

54:02.876 --> 54:06.792
I'm very happy to be here
with you today.

54:07.001 --> 54:10.751
Mauro has told me all about you,
I know times are hard,

54:10.959 --> 54:14.709
but Mauro's a good man and with
God's help we'll find him a job.

54:14.917 --> 54:17.834
A job !? He's a lazy asshole...

54:19.834 --> 54:21.792
Madam, no...

54:23.334 --> 54:26.709
Mauro, you were right,
you're in deep trouble.

54:27.626 --> 54:30.626
Listen, Pietro, I'll tell you again...

54:30.834 --> 54:34.042
if you've anything that needs doing,
even if it's illegal...

54:34.251 --> 54:37.459
- Not again ! I'm a priest!
- I know that...

54:37.667 --> 54:40.251
but how many priests... you know ?

54:40.459 --> 54:42.876
What ? Go and have a rest,
you're tired.

54:43.084 --> 54:46.542
I have to go now,
but do me a favour...

54:46.751 --> 54:49.626
- When you feel down, and desperate...
- Pray.

54:49.834 --> 54:52.876
No, call me, any time you want.
I'm here for you.

54:54.292 --> 54:56.792
You must never lose hope.

54:57.709 --> 54:59.209
All right.

55:03.751 --> 55:05.167
Bye.

55:13.376 --> 55:14.792
Is Andrea in his room ?

55:17.876 --> 55:18.876
Thanks.

55:21.792 --> 55:24.792
- Welcome back !
- Hi.

55:28.959 --> 55:31.792
- I've missed you.
- Me too.

55:32.001 --> 55:34.292
Dad, I want to introduce you
to a friend of mine.

55:36.209 --> 55:38.084
This is the famous Fr. Pietro.

55:38.292 --> 55:41.667
- This is my father, Tommaso.
- Hello.

55:47.376 --> 55:50.001
You look more like a Mauro to me.

55:50.209 --> 55:53.001
- I don't get it...
- Fr. Pietro likes to joke.

55:53.209 --> 55:55.626
- So does your father.
- No, Dad's serious.

55:55.834 --> 55:59.251
- He's a famous heart surgeon.
- So he earns a fortune.

55:59.459 --> 56:01.334
Even doctors are struggling.

56:02.501 --> 56:05.042
Dad, can I finish talking
to Fr. Pietro ?

56:05.251 --> 56:06.334
Of course.

56:06.542 --> 56:09.542
I have a lot of things
to tell Andrea, too.

56:09.751 --> 56:12.584
- You can tell him next time maybe.
- No !

56:12.792 --> 56:15.042
Go, you're a busy heart surgeon !

56:15.251 --> 56:17.042
- Beverages ?
- No.

56:17.251 --> 56:19.084
- Soft drink ?
- I'll get it.

56:19.292 --> 56:20.542
Goon!

56:21.876 --> 56:23.792
- I'll see to it.
- Thanks.

56:28.834 --> 56:31.501
Tommaso, I need your help now.

56:31.709 --> 56:35.709
I don't know what to do about Bianca.
She's really into Catholicism.

56:35.917 --> 56:39.417
She insists we can't have sex
if it's not for procreation purposes.

56:39.626 --> 56:41.042
Can you imagine ?

56:41.251 --> 56:44.459
What shall I do ?
It's a physical necessity for me !

56:44.667 --> 56:47.084
Perhaps you could talk to her.

56:48.417 --> 56:50.834
- I'll see you out.
- No need.

56:51.042 --> 56:54.001
Will you talk to her ?
Was that a yes ?

56:54.209 --> 56:55.959
Nice house !

57:02.459 --> 57:03.876
Aren't you feeling well ?

57:07.417 --> 57:10.167
What a view !
All of Rome at your feet.

57:15.126 --> 57:18.792
- What did you tell Andrea ?
- Nothing, I can keep a secret.

57:20.209 --> 57:22.209
Professional ethics.

57:23.709 --> 57:24.751
Thank you.

57:24.959 --> 57:27.126
But I want you to tell me something...

57:27.334 --> 57:29.042
Why ?

57:30.834 --> 57:32.792
Because it's inadmissible

57:33.001 --> 57:36.501
that my son, who has a brilliant
medical career ahead of him,

57:36.709 --> 57:40.459
should throw it all away
for something that doesn't exist,

57:40.667 --> 57:44.084
just because someone
has brainwashed him.

57:44.292 --> 57:46.501
- I've brainwashed him ?
- Yes !

57:46.709 --> 57:50.001
Before he met you,
Andrea never wanted to be a priest.

57:50.209 --> 57:53.126
- How do you know ?
- He's easily influenced.

57:53.334 --> 57:54.542
He's a child !

57:54.751 --> 57:58.792
- You've often influenced him !
- I'm his father, I'm allowed to.

57:59.001 --> 58:02.626
Yes ! And for once when Andrea
makes up his own mind,

58:02.834 --> 58:07.042
his father disappears and Mauro
and all his problems appear.

58:09.626 --> 58:11.376
All right...

58:11.584 --> 58:14.251
I apologize for tricking you.

58:14.459 --> 58:15.751
Sorry.

58:16.792 --> 58:18.459
Good man.

58:18.667 --> 58:20.751
Repentance is praiseworthy.

58:20.959 --> 58:22.209
But not enough.

58:22.417 --> 58:26.417
In confession, first we have
repentance, then penance.

58:26.626 --> 58:28.126
How many Hail Marys ?

58:28.334 --> 58:29.917
No, that's too easy !

58:30.126 --> 58:31.959
What do you mean ?

58:32.167 --> 58:36.417
You know all the restoration work
at the church ? I need a volunteer.

58:38.542 --> 58:40.626
You must be joking.

58:40.834 --> 58:42.209
<i>No.</i>

58:42.417 --> 58:44.917
- You can forget it.
- That's too bad.

58:45.126 --> 58:48.292
What will Andrea think
when he finds out his father,

58:48.501 --> 58:52.917
the intelligent, democratic,
and tolerant man he praises to me...

58:53.584 --> 58:55.584
is actually a hypocrite ?

58:59.167 --> 59:00.459
You get the idea !

59:00.667 --> 59:03.584
You will help me out
for a whole month.

59:03.792 --> 59:06.292
Then you can go your own way.

01:00:00.751 --> 01:00:03.459
Right, I'll count to three,
we'll lift it up

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:05.667
and hang it up there.

01:00:07.584 --> 01:00:10.042
One, two...

01:00:10.251 --> 01:00:13.001
Why not call
one of your fanatic followers ?

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:15.251
We can manage, come on !

01:00:15.917 --> 01:00:17.626
One, two...

01:00:17.834 --> 01:00:20.876
I'll pay for it to get done,
consider it a donation.

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:24.376
You priests are good at taking
money... everyone knows that.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:31.501
One, two...

01:00:31.709 --> 01:00:34.084
It annoys me on a symbolic level.

01:00:34.292 --> 01:00:38.417
So are you trying to say
you're too old for this ?

01:00:39.417 --> 01:00:40.751
One...

01:00:41.917 --> 01:00:43.042
two...

01:00:44.126 --> 01:00:46.501
Easy now, one step at a time.

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:49.376
Lift your feet up,
it won't hurt as much.

01:00:49.584 --> 01:00:52.209
- Try tilting your pelvis.
- Oh please...

01:00:52.417 --> 01:00:54.001
It helps, trust me.

01:00:54.209 --> 01:00:55.876
Slowly now.

01:00:56.084 --> 01:00:57.709
Rest, deep breath.

01:00:57.917 --> 01:00:59.042
Wait !

01:00:59.251 --> 01:01:01.084
- Sorry...
- Is that better ?

01:01:01.292 --> 01:01:02.751
- No.
- Good, come on !

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:06.251
A few steps more...
It's more a psychological pain.

01:01:06.459 --> 01:01:10.792
What ? This is a disc hernia.
L-4, L-5, I know !

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:14.292
Okay, now concentrate,
this is the hard bit.

01:01:14.501 --> 01:01:17.876
Try and lean forward
and I'll push you in.

01:01:18.084 --> 01:01:21.251
- Don't push me.
- Slowly does it, from behind.

01:01:21.459 --> 01:01:24.376
Rotate your hip...
There we go !

01:01:24.959 --> 01:01:27.334
You should be happy
to have this pain.

01:01:27.542 --> 01:01:30.709
It means the Lord
is putting you to the test.

01:01:30.917 --> 01:01:32.667
Go fuck...

01:01:36.792 --> 01:01:38.084
Bye-bye.

01:01:57.709 --> 01:01:59.042
What's up ?

01:01:59.959 --> 01:02:04.001
I don't see why you're doing this,
you already have a parish.

01:02:04.209 --> 01:02:07.751
I'm doing it for my mother,
I caused her so much sorrow.

01:02:07.959 --> 01:02:11.084
- If she could see me as a priest...
- But where do I fit in ?

01:02:11.292 --> 01:02:12.792
It's for your sake too.

01:02:13.001 --> 01:02:15.376
In fact, you should be thanking me...

01:02:23.126 --> 01:02:25.042
Listen, priest...

01:02:25.251 --> 01:02:27.667
I don't have to thank anyone.

01:02:27.876 --> 01:02:31.167
While you pretend to save people
with your prayers,

01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:32.834
blessings and incense...

01:02:33.042 --> 01:02:36.042
I really do save people !

01:02:36.251 --> 01:02:39.417
And they thank me for it,
every day !

01:02:39.626 --> 01:02:40.917
Is that clear ?

01:02:49.334 --> 01:02:51.251
What a nasty temper !

01:02:52.084 --> 01:02:53.709
But remember,

01:02:53.917 --> 01:02:57.042
even if you do save people,
you are still a human being.

01:02:57.251 --> 01:03:00.834
Perhaps you thought you were God,
but you're not, sorry.

01:03:01.042 --> 01:03:03.376
Death comes
when you least expect it,

01:03:03.584 --> 01:03:06.667
"like a thief in the night"
as Saint Paul put it.

01:03:09.001 --> 01:03:10.834
Have you read his Letters ?

01:03:11.042 --> 01:03:13.084
Read his First Letter
to the Corinthians.

01:03:13.292 --> 01:03:16.292
- Give me a break.
- "For who regards you as superior ?

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:19.251
What do you have
that wasn't given to you ?"

01:03:19.459 --> 01:03:23.542
«This morning there were violent»
«clashes in the centre of Rome»

01:03:23.751 --> 01:03:26.501
<i>“during a student demonstration.»</i>

01:03:29.459 --> 01:03:31.709
I didn't have any palpitations
last night.

01:03:31.917 --> 01:03:34.126
Perhaps I'm getting better,
doctor.

01:03:36.459 --> 01:03:37.542
I don't believe it !

01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:42.751
No !
It's a tragedy !

01:03:44.084 --> 01:03:45.876
Where are you going ?

01:03:46.667 --> 01:03:49.126
Tell me the truth, am I dying ?

01:03:54.876 --> 01:03:56.459
Thank you, darling.

01:04:05.459 --> 01:04:08.834
- Carla, we need to talk.
- I have nothing to say to you.

01:04:09.042 --> 01:04:13.626
- We can't carry on like this.
- Gianni's finding me a place.

01:04:13.834 --> 01:04:15.709
Now get out.

01:04:16.792 --> 01:04:18.459
- Listen, Carla...
- Get out !

01:04:36.501 --> 01:04:38.251
What is it, Tommaso ?

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.542
- Nothing.
- You look miserable.

01:04:41.751 --> 01:04:44.501
- Is anything wrong ?
- No, not at all.

01:04:44.709 --> 01:04:46.834
I'm here for you.

01:04:51.209 --> 01:04:54.209
Listen, seeing you're here,
why don't you talk to Andrea ?

01:04:54.417 --> 01:04:57.584
- He's not cut out to be a priest.
- I don't agree with you.

01:04:57.792 --> 01:05:01.501
I think it's the right job for him,
he's smart, he'll go far.

01:05:01.709 --> 01:05:04.209
- Wouldn't you like a bishop son ?
- Pietro, please !

01:05:04.417 --> 01:05:05.792
It's well paid !

01:05:06.001 --> 01:05:07.584
Fr. Pietro !

01:05:10.084 --> 01:05:11.459
Hold this.

01:05:13.917 --> 01:05:16.459
- What do you want ?
- I've brought you the money.

01:05:16.667 --> 01:05:19.501
- Hurry up then.
- Here.

01:05:20.876 --> 01:05:23.501
- Just this once.
- Thanks.

01:05:23.709 --> 01:05:26.042
- Be good.
- I love you.

01:05:26.251 --> 01:05:29.334
- Say hi to your wife for me.
- I will. Bye.

01:05:29.917 --> 01:05:31.917
Let's go and clean the brushes.

01:05:36.334 --> 01:05:39.709
That's Mimmo, a decent guy
but obsessed with video poker.

01:05:39.917 --> 01:05:43.751
So I mind his wage and give
him some money now and then.

01:05:43.959 --> 01:05:45.792
Give me back my pizza.

01:05:53.917 --> 01:05:57.667
Professor, can you sign
Mrs. Mariani's discharge ?

01:06:02.209 --> 01:06:03.584
Thank you.

01:06:05.167 --> 01:06:08.042
- What have I done ?
- Have you changed your hairstyle ?

01:06:08.251 --> 01:06:10.376
Yes. I shouldn't have ?

01:06:10.584 --> 01:06:11.792
It suits you.

01:06:12.667 --> 01:06:13.751
Thank you.

01:06:22.834 --> 01:06:27.126
- Is Andrea not here ?
- He's at the priest's meeting.

01:06:30.042 --> 01:06:33.251
By the way, that business
about Bianca and Catholicism...

01:06:33.459 --> 01:06:36.251
It's okay now,
she's into the Orient now.

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:40.334
She saw some tantra videos
on Youtube, and...

01:06:40.542 --> 01:06:44.126
Tommaso, our sex life
has really taken off again,

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:46.417
we're going whole hog !

01:06:46.626 --> 01:06:48.959
Please, I'm eating !

01:06:49.167 --> 01:06:50.626
So?

01:06:56.126 --> 01:06:58.626
No luck, she says she's not hungry.

01:06:58.834 --> 01:07:01.917
I'm worried, she's getting
more and more depressed.

01:07:02.542 --> 01:07:04.917
Don't worry, you know
what she's like.

01:07:07.417 --> 01:07:09.459
Why, do you know
what she's like, Dad ?

01:07:09.667 --> 01:07:12.667
You don't, or she wouldn't
be in this state now.

01:07:14.626 --> 01:07:16.709
Come on, Bianca, eat up !

01:07:16.917 --> 01:07:19.334
He thinks he knows everything !

01:07:19.542 --> 01:07:22.084
With that air of superiority,
always judging people.

01:07:22.292 --> 01:07:24.709
Because he's the best !
No way...

01:07:24.917 --> 01:07:27.751
All we needed was you
spouting this rubbish !

01:07:27.959 --> 01:07:29.667
Of course, I'm stupid !

01:07:29.876 --> 01:07:33.417
You've always thought that,
but you had Andrea to make up for it.

01:07:33.626 --> 01:07:36.709
You've always despised me, Dad.

01:07:36.917 --> 01:07:39.251
You've always despised us both.

01:07:39.459 --> 01:07:42.751
My husband might not be a genius
or the most handsome

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:46.626
but at least he never judges me
the way you have,

01:07:46.834 --> 01:07:48.626
ever since I was a child.

01:07:48.834 --> 01:07:51.876
And I have always tried
not to let you down.

01:07:52.084 --> 01:07:54.084
I remember when I was a child,

01:07:54.292 --> 01:07:58.167
you would force me to listen to
Guccini, De Gregori, De André !

01:07:59.459 --> 01:08:01.917
Making a 7-year-old
listen to De André...

01:08:02.126 --> 01:08:03.792
is really mean !

01:08:06.334 --> 01:08:08.584
In fact, I want to tell you
something else

01:08:08.792 --> 01:08:10.709
that will really hurt you.

01:08:10.917 --> 01:08:13.042
I like Gigi D'Alessio !

01:08:13.251 --> 01:08:16.376
Yes, you heard me !
Because he's great, he moves me,

01:08:16.584 --> 01:08:18.209
makes me feel better !

01:08:20.834 --> 01:08:23.001
I'm going home.

01:08:29.251 --> 01:08:31.084
What's come over her ?

01:08:32.459 --> 01:08:34.042
Tommaso, forgive me...

01:08:36.167 --> 01:08:37.792
Good night.

01:08:46.417 --> 01:08:48.542
At the Saviour's command

01:08:48.751 --> 01:08:52.251
and formed by divine teaching,
we dare to say:

01:08:53.667 --> 01:08:57.001
Our Father who art in heaven,

01:08:57.209 --> 01:09:00.001
hallowed be thy name,

01:09:00.209 --> 01:09:04.001
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

01:09:04.876 --> 01:09:07.001
on earth, as it is in heaven.

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:09.209
Looking for me in church now ?

01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:12.876
What's wrong, Tommaso ?

01:09:13.084 --> 01:09:15.084
Nothing, what could be wrong ?

01:09:21.334 --> 01:09:23.459
Do you never feel lonely ?

01:09:23.667 --> 01:09:26.417
No, never, because
I am never on my own.

01:09:26.626 --> 01:09:29.167
And neither are you, because of...

01:09:29.376 --> 01:09:31.459
Not your imaginary friend again !

01:09:36.376 --> 01:09:37.959
Come with me.

01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:19.084
When I'm feeling down,
I come here.

01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:23.292
I discovered this place
one morning, many years ago,

01:10:23.501 --> 01:10:25.709
after I was released from jail.

01:10:26.834 --> 01:10:28.501
Yes, I've been in jail.

01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:32.084
And not just once !
There's lots you don't know about me !

01:10:32.459 --> 01:10:35.084
I might tell you one day.

01:10:35.792 --> 01:10:37.417
We're friends now.

01:10:40.084 --> 01:10:43.584
I didn't know what to do,
so I sat here.

01:10:45.292 --> 01:10:47.542
- And what did you think about ?
- Nothing...

01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:49.417
Nothing at all.

01:10:49.626 --> 01:10:51.542
I was on my own here.

01:10:52.459 --> 01:10:55.834
No desires, no expectations,
no fears.

01:10:57.001 --> 01:10:58.667
Just this.

01:10:59.834 --> 01:11:02.959
Then suddenly,
in a fraction of a second

01:11:04.209 --> 01:11:06.084
it all became clear.

01:11:07.917 --> 01:11:11.167
Three clays later I entered
the seminary, and here I am.

01:11:12.876 --> 01:11:16.834
Between you and me, do you
really believe there is a God ?

01:11:17.792 --> 01:11:21.084
- Who do you think God is ?
- I don't know, you're the expert.

01:11:22.751 --> 01:11:25.792
You know those hot summer mornings
when it's really stuffy,

01:11:26.001 --> 01:11:28.584
you open a window
and cool air caresses your face ?

01:11:28.792 --> 01:11:30.584
- That's a breeze.
- No, it's God.

01:11:31.334 --> 01:11:33.834
And when the clouds
take on those strange shapes,

01:11:34.042 --> 01:11:36.417
a horse, a face, a carrot...

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.084
and you keep staring at them...

01:11:38.292 --> 01:11:41.584
- That too is God.
- Who's in church then ?

01:11:42.376 --> 01:11:45.626
Do you think God is happy
to be cooped up in one place ?

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:48.042
It's not enough, is it ?

01:11:50.001 --> 01:11:51.626
See that pear ?

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:55.709
Inevitably,
that pear will fall one day.

01:11:57.501 --> 01:11:59.709
Bet you think it's due to gravity.

01:11:59.917 --> 01:12:01.376
No, it's God !

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:03.751
You're starting to get the idea.

01:12:16.959 --> 01:12:19.084
- Darling, what's wrong ?
- I don't know.

01:12:19.292 --> 01:12:22.959
- I'm always tired.
- You're okay, don't worry.

01:12:23.167 --> 01:12:26.042
- Let me feel your pulse.
- What are you doing ?

01:12:30.751 --> 01:12:34.084
Slight tachycardia.
Let me look at your eye.

01:12:34.292 --> 01:12:36.126
Keep still !

01:12:39.542 --> 01:12:41.709
Nothing serious, don't worry.

01:12:42.417 --> 01:12:44.667
But go to the pharmacy...

01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:47.751
and ask for these tablets.

01:12:48.626 --> 01:12:52.917
Take three a day after meals
for a week.

01:12:55.042 --> 01:12:57.542
And just to be on the safe side,

01:12:57.751 --> 01:13:00.376
have a full check-up done,
okay ?

01:13:00.917 --> 01:13:02.001
Here.

01:13:02.959 --> 01:13:06.001
- Do you want some more pizza ?
- If you insist.

01:13:06.209 --> 01:13:09.042
- Boy!
- Here I am!

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:11.876
- Two more cheese slices.
- Coming up.

01:13:12.084 --> 01:13:14.376
Said, two cheese slices.
Come on !

01:13:14.584 --> 01:13:17.376
The service is rubbish,
but the pizza's good.

01:14:05.084 --> 01:14:08.001
«Back to the news in half an hour.»

01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:11.626
«I'll leave you with the lyrics»
«and music of Gigi D'Alessio !»

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:22.792
I was about to call you.

01:15:24.001 --> 01:15:25.626
Have a seat.

01:15:33.126 --> 01:15:35.292
- A drop of wine ?
- No.

01:15:35.501 --> 01:15:36.751
Just a sip.

01:15:48.251 --> 01:15:49.667
Try it.

01:15:49.876 --> 01:15:52.667
I made it,
it was one of your favourites.

01:16:00.751 --> 01:16:02.334
How is it ?

01:16:04.876 --> 01:16:05.959
So so...

01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:14.876
What's with all this ?

01:16:15.084 --> 01:16:17.834
I wanted us to have an evening
all to ourselves.

01:16:21.042 --> 01:16:22.959
You're so beautiful, Carla.

01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:26.376
Tommaso, stop it,
you're scaring me.

01:16:26.584 --> 01:16:28.209
It's the truth.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.501
Are you courting me ?

01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:32.292
Perhaps.

01:16:33.459 --> 01:16:36.209
You've started taking
the antidepressants again.

01:16:36.417 --> 01:16:37.626
<i>No.</i>

01:16:37.834 --> 01:16:40.251
It's just an excuse really.

01:16:40.459 --> 01:16:42.792
I'm more interested in after dinner.

01:16:45.042 --> 01:16:46.751
I've finished then.

01:16:46.959 --> 01:16:48.584
Don't you want the main dish ?

01:16:48.792 --> 01:16:50.876
Pot roast cooked in Barolo wine.

01:16:51.376 --> 01:16:53.126
Did you make it ?

01:16:53.334 --> 01:16:55.292
I'd better not then.

01:16:58.792 --> 01:17:01.001
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- No.

01:17:01.209 --> 01:17:03.792
- What do you mean ?
- The month is up, you're free.

01:17:04.001 --> 01:17:07.251
We have to remove the stains
from the floors, move the pews...

01:17:07.459 --> 01:17:09.501
I'll take care of that,
you go home !

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:13.334
- I won't see you again ?
- You can come to Mass on Sunday.

01:17:13.542 --> 01:17:15.834
Then I won't see you again !

01:17:19.417 --> 01:17:20.876
Watch out !

01:17:22.001 --> 01:17:25.126
Listen, let's grab a bite at Said's.

01:17:25.334 --> 01:17:28.751
- I have to work tonight.
- I can't, I have a meeting.

01:17:28.959 --> 01:17:32.376
But if you've nothing to do,
go and talk to Andrea.

01:17:32.584 --> 01:17:34.584
- About what ?
- You know what.

01:17:34.792 --> 01:17:38.584
If you're convinced it's not for him,
you have to tell him.

01:17:40.042 --> 01:17:43.084
I don't know
what to tell him anymore.

01:17:43.292 --> 01:17:46.084
Tell him whatever you want,
just talk to him.

01:17:46.292 --> 01:17:48.251
The time has come, right ?

01:17:48.959 --> 01:17:51.126
Look at this bougainvillea !

01:18:03.501 --> 01:18:05.001
Andrea ?

01:18:06.667 --> 01:18:08.292
Oh, I'm sorry !

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:10.459
Dad !

01:18:12.292 --> 01:18:13.959
- Dad...
- It's okay.

01:18:14.167 --> 01:18:16.251
- No, let me explain.
- You don't need to.

01:18:16.459 --> 01:18:20.459
Yes, I do.
So much has happened recently.

01:18:20.667 --> 01:18:23.209
During the weeks
at the spiritual retreat...

01:18:24.126 --> 01:18:26.209
I started to have some doubts

01:18:26.417 --> 01:18:29.542
and I thought perhaps
I wasn't cut out for priesthood.

01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:32.292
I know I should have
told you before, but

01:18:32.501 --> 01:18:35.042
I was embarrassed
because I'd changed my mind.

01:18:35.917 --> 01:18:38.376
There's nothing wrong
with changing your mind.

01:18:38.584 --> 01:18:40.667
- I do it a lot myself.
- Is that so ?

01:18:40.876 --> 01:18:43.834
I thought you were the man
of absolute certainties.

01:18:44.917 --> 01:18:47.584
I thought that too.
But no...

01:18:55.084 --> 01:18:57.751
- So no priest for a son ?
- No !

01:18:57.959 --> 01:19:00.876
- Who's going to tell Fr. Pietro ?
- He already knows.

01:19:02.001 --> 01:19:05.417
- What ?
- I told him when he came here.

01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:10.417
So he's known all this time ?

01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:13.667
He convinced me to change paths
because I was too unsure.

01:19:14.251 --> 01:19:16.626
And then I met Alessia
at his meetings,

01:19:16.834 --> 01:19:18.501
the girl you...

01:19:19.042 --> 01:19:22.251
Okay, I have to go. We're going
to Fr. Pietro's meeting later.

01:19:22.459 --> 01:19:24.584
- Bye, Dad.
- Go on.

01:19:26.167 --> 01:19:27.792
The bastard !

01:20:11.334 --> 01:20:13.209
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

01:20:15.292 --> 01:20:17.709
How long will it be ?
I'm due at the hospital.

01:20:17.917 --> 01:20:20.209
- Five minutes.
- Good.

01:20:20.417 --> 01:20:22.334
I'll go and get changed.

01:20:44.959 --> 01:20:47.126
- Excuse me, professor.
- Yes.

01:20:59.292 --> 01:21:01.292
I got the CT scan results.

01:21:02.376 --> 01:21:04.876
- Well ?
- He has a frontal-parietal hematoma,

01:21:05.084 --> 01:21:06.917
with considerable shift.

01:21:07.126 --> 01:21:09.251
I have to operate immediately.

01:21:11.501 --> 01:21:13.709
De Luca, I'll be honest with you...

01:21:14.751 --> 01:21:16.834
it'd take a miracle.

01:21:18.334 --> 01:21:20.584
Do you want to observe ?

01:21:40.626 --> 01:21:43.959
Sandro, I have to go.
Will you look after the ward ?

01:21:44.167 --> 01:21:45.667
Of course.

01:22:13.876 --> 01:22:16.959
- Well, Dad ?
- The neurosurgeon's a friend of mine.

01:22:17.167 --> 01:22:19.417
He's very good,
he'll do all he can.

01:22:19.626 --> 01:22:21.251
But how is he ?

01:22:21.459 --> 01:22:22.501
Not well.

01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:24.584
He's not well.

01:22:25.501 --> 01:22:27.751
Call me when you get news.

01:22:27.959 --> 01:22:30.917
- Where are you going ?
- I have to do something.
