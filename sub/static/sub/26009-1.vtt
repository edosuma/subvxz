00:10.766 --> 00:12.867
You're all loaded up,
Chef Edward, sir.

00:12.869 --> 00:15.169
- Ready to go.
- Thank you, Thomas.

00:15.171 --> 00:16.937
Here, for later.

00:16.939 --> 00:18.405
It's elderberry pie.

00:18.407 --> 00:20.008
Oh, thank you, Chef Edward.

00:20.010 --> 00:21.341
Oh, my gosh, is that...

00:21.343 --> 00:23.143
Chef Edward's elderberry pie?

00:23.145 --> 00:25.980
- Give me some of that!
- I love your casserole, Chef Edward.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.314
Hello, Chef Edward.

00:27.316 --> 00:28.782
You're the greatest,
Mr. DuFlay.

00:28.784 --> 00:31.184
What's cooking tonight,
Chef Edward?

00:31.186 --> 00:33.119
We love you, Chef Edward.

00:33.121 --> 00:34.857
Can't wait to see what
you'll cook tonight, Chef DuFlay.

Ah!

01:35.250 --> 01:36.585
Please!

01:37.253 --> 01:39.219
Beware. Beware.

01:39.221 --> 01:40.688
Beware!

Red Ghost, Red Ghost!

03:14.716 --> 03:19.386
Gee, Freddie, it sure was nice of your
uncle to invite us to stay at his inn.

03:19.388 --> 03:21.922
I can't wait to see what
he's done with the place.

03:21.924 --> 03:24.224
It's been in the family
for generations.

03:24.226 --> 03:27.295
According to <i>Old Newport Cove</i>
by Henry Metcalf,

03:27.297 --> 03:30.331
the Rocky Harbor Inn
has been vacant since 1780,

03:30.333 --> 03:34.167
when the original owner disappeared
under mysterious circumstances.

03:34.169 --> 03:36.404
Oh, man, I wish we could go
one weekend

03:36.406 --> 03:39.739
without mysterious circumstances
and disappearing acts.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.875
Are you with me, Scoob?

03:41.877 --> 03:44.178
Like, speaking of
disappearing acts,

03:44.180 --> 03:46.016
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

03:50.218 --> 03:52.786
The only thing disappearing
around here is our lunch.

03:52.788 --> 03:54.688
Well, that's just
great, Scoob.

03:54.690 --> 03:56.391
Now we're all gonna starve.

03:58.828 --> 04:02.696
Don't worry, gang. I'm sure my Uncle
Bobby won't let us go hungry.

04:02.698 --> 04:04.565
Ooh, can he cook?

04:04.567 --> 04:07.434
The "Rocky Harbor
Culinary Resort"?

04:07.436 --> 04:09.138
I'll take that
as a yes!

04:19.880 --> 04:21.380
Freddie.

04:21.382 --> 04:22.785
Hey, Uncle Bobby.

04:24.287 --> 04:25.585
This is the gang.

04:25.587 --> 04:27.321
Gang, this is my uncle,

04:27.323 --> 04:28.624
Bobby Flay.

04:33.263 --> 04:35.261
"Culinary Resort," of course.

04:35.263 --> 04:39.165
Exactly the kind of place you'd
expect to find a world-famous chef.

04:39.167 --> 04:40.568
World-famous?

04:40.570 --> 04:42.436
Don't tell us you've never
heard of Bobby Flay?

04:42.438 --> 04:43.838
Of course, I have.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.008
He's my uncle. I just
introduced you.

04:48.210 --> 04:49.643
Chef Bobby Flay.

04:49.645 --> 04:52.045
I bet you can cook
just about anything.

04:52.047 --> 04:54.047
Well, I...
I wouldn't say that.

04:54.049 --> 04:57.417
- Lamb chops?
- Well, yes, I can cook lamb chops.

04:57.419 --> 04:58.752
Herb-crusted?

04:58.754 --> 05:00.220
Yeah, I can do herb-crusted.

05:00.222 --> 05:03.256
With a balsamic reduction
served on a silky smooth

05:03.258 --> 05:06.425
Red Norland puree?

05:06.427 --> 05:10.429
Sure. I'd probably swap the potatoes
for a creamy garlic Parmesan.

05:10.431 --> 05:11.965
Or a Chevre Noir polenta.

05:11.967 --> 05:15.535
Or, even a simple warm
heirloom tomato vinaigrette.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.240
He must have fainted.

05:20.242 --> 05:21.908
Should I get
some smelling salts?

05:21.910 --> 05:23.780
No, he'll just eat them.

05:25.582 --> 05:27.684
Lobster.

05:30.085 --> 05:33.254
Oh, sorry. No, that's...
That's Nacho's.

05:33.256 --> 05:34.788
Um, sorry, Uncle B,

05:34.790 --> 05:37.323
but I think Scoob and I know
the difference between

05:37.325 --> 05:39.193
lobsters and nachos.

05:39.195 --> 05:40.761
Lobster nachos!

05:40.763 --> 05:42.730
Like, yum! Write that down.

05:42.732 --> 05:45.702
No, sorry. I mean this lobster
belongs to Nacho.

05:48.171 --> 05:49.703
Nacho Flay, my cat.

05:49.705 --> 05:52.273
And for the record, those are
grilled blue lobster tails,

05:52.275 --> 05:55.343
drizzled with lemon-basil
butter, and garlic chives.

05:55.345 --> 05:57.978
I can make some for you guys.
Or anything you want, really.

06:04.186 --> 06:06.554
Oh, yeah.
I think they like it here.

06:06.556 --> 06:07.955
Come on, gang.

06:07.957 --> 06:09.956
The whole north wing,
including this lobby

06:09.958 --> 06:12.660
is a faithful recreation
of the 18th-century inn.

06:12.662 --> 06:16.129
So the old inn was closed down
during the American Revolution?

06:16.131 --> 06:19.199
Yup. And since then, it's been
completely vacant.

06:19.201 --> 06:21.369
Except for
the occasional spider.

06:21.371 --> 06:22.569
Spider?

06:23.905 --> 06:25.773
All right, if there are
no more questions,

06:25.775 --> 06:28.542
- let's move on to the...
- I have a question.

06:28.544 --> 06:31.110
- What is it, Shaggy?
- Can you make beef Wellington?

06:31.112 --> 06:34.215
I meant questions
about the inn.

06:34.217 --> 06:38.386
All right, okay. Well, uh, beef Wellington's
a complex and time-consuming dish

06:38.388 --> 06:40.020
to prepare.
But, yeah, I've made it.

06:40.022 --> 06:42.723
Sorry, I meant, will you make
beef Wellington...

06:42.725 --> 06:44.992
- Like, right now?
- Shaggy!

06:44.994 --> 06:47.460
What? We don't hang around
a lot of chefs.

06:47.462 --> 06:50.163
I wanna make sure
we get our money's worth.

06:50.165 --> 06:51.799
We're not paying any money.

06:51.801 --> 06:53.400
Good idea. Listen, pal,

06:53.402 --> 06:56.270
we're not paying till
we see the beef Wellington.

06:56.272 --> 06:57.774
Okay. Moving on.

07:08.818 --> 07:10.785
Whose portrait is this?

07:10.787 --> 07:14.254
That's the original owner. Our
great, great, great, great, great...

07:14.256 --> 07:15.422
Let's just say,

07:15.424 --> 07:18.225
really great-uncle,
Chef Edward DuFlay.

07:18.227 --> 07:21.095
"Chef"? You mean, it runs
in the family?

07:21.097 --> 07:23.631
From what I've read, people
around here still call him

07:23.633 --> 07:25.932
the world's first
celebrity chef.

07:25.934 --> 07:29.903
Has the restoration of the inn yielded any
clues about Uncle Edward's disappearance?

07:29.905 --> 07:32.174
We hope.
But so far, not a thing.

07:44.554 --> 07:46.056
Whew. Thank you.

07:55.364 --> 07:58.064
Why do you call it
a culinary resort?

07:58.066 --> 08:02.403
The answer, Daphne,
is just through these doors.

08:02.405 --> 08:05.806
It's time to check out
the really cool stuff.

08:05.808 --> 08:07.444
This is where
the magic happens.

08:47.048 --> 08:49.051
Welcome to
the cooking arena.

08:49.918 --> 08:51.718
Jeepers.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.386
Whoa!

08:53.388 --> 08:54.588
Nirvana!

08:54.590 --> 08:55.923
Yeah!

08:55.925 --> 08:57.824
So the Rocky Harbor
isn't just an inn.

08:57.826 --> 08:59.727
- It's a...
- <i>A state-of-the-art,</i>

08:59.729 --> 09:03.197
<i>kitchen fantasy camp, designed
to make cooking easy and fun.</i>

09:03.199 --> 09:05.098
Like, dude, who said that?

09:05.100 --> 09:07.468
That's the interactive
computer program that keeps

09:07.470 --> 09:09.502
everything in the place
running.

09:09.504 --> 09:12.338
- Thanks, Rocky.
- <i>You're very welcome, Bobby.</i>

09:12.340 --> 09:15.742
In here, guests can experiment
with their own recipes,

09:15.744 --> 09:18.112
or learn techniques from
some of my pals.

09:18.114 --> 09:19.179
Oh, man!

09:19.181 --> 09:21.147
Is that Giada De Laurentiis?

09:21.149 --> 09:22.315
Ow!

09:22.317 --> 09:24.987
Yup. And the lovely
Bella De Laurentiis.

09:33.128 --> 09:35.228
And those are
Chef Marcus Samuelsson

09:35.230 --> 09:37.698
and his supermodel wife,
Maya Haile.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.333
Hey, Shaggy, didn't you
meet them once?

09:40.335 --> 09:43.804
Yeah. It was the best day
of my life.

09:43.806 --> 09:48.007
<i>So, uh, Maya, I've read that
at home, your roles are reversed.</i>

09:48.009 --> 09:50.144
<i>It's true.</i>

09:50.146 --> 09:53.380
<i>He's the chef, yet I do
all the cooking at home.</i>

09:53.382 --> 09:55.415
<i>But I do all
the supermodeling at home.</i>

09:55.417 --> 09:56.549
<i>So it evens out.</i>

09:56.551 --> 09:58.586
- <i>Next.</i>
- <i>Hey, there,</i>

09:58.588 --> 10:00.887
<i>who should we sign
this out to?</i>

10:00.889 --> 10:02.455
<i>Wait, this is not
our book.</i>

10:02.457 --> 10:04.324
<i>It's Giada's book!
Really?</i>

10:04.326 --> 10:06.995
Could you have her make it out to Shaggy?
With love.

10:10.865 --> 10:13.266
Shaggy!

10:13.268 --> 10:17.905
Ooh! Mr. Taylor, first of
all, I just love your show.

10:17.907 --> 10:20.473
Second, is it true that the
fork should always be placed

10:20.475 --> 10:21.607
to the left of the plate?

10:22.710 --> 10:24.410
- No!
- Uh, actually, Skip,

10:24.412 --> 10:26.378
- that is true.
- Says who?

10:26.380 --> 10:28.881
Me, Bobby Flay.
I own this place.

10:28.883 --> 10:30.918
Oh, my gosh! Sorry, Bobby!

10:30.920 --> 10:32.553
I'm a little out of it.

10:32.555 --> 10:34.387
Haven't slept in days.

10:34.389 --> 10:36.491
- Not since the Red Ghos...
- All right, Skip. That's enough.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.628
Back to it.

10:39.561 --> 10:41.495
Okay, cadets,

10:41.497 --> 10:45.064
let's discuss the proper way to
spit gross stuff into your napkin.

10:45.066 --> 10:46.333
Now, we put the, oh...

10:46.335 --> 10:48.801
That is terrible.
Really terrible.

10:48.803 --> 10:50.804
Are these the old ones?

10:50.806 --> 10:52.072
These are terrible.

10:52.074 --> 10:55.208
Oh, that's...

10:55.210 --> 10:57.877
Hey, Uncle Bobby, what was
Skip Taylor talking about?

10:57.879 --> 11:00.914
Well, sometimes you don't like
the way something tastes

11:00.916 --> 11:02.916
and if you have
a napkin handy...

11:02.918 --> 11:05.419
No, he means,
"Not since the Red..."

11:05.421 --> 11:07.521
Yeah! "Red" what?

11:07.523 --> 11:08.990
I... I have no idea.

11:08.992 --> 11:12.492
Oh, okay, uh, who wants to go
taste a nine-cheese souffle?

11:12.494 --> 11:14.261
Cheese!

11:14.263 --> 11:15.898
Who doesn't love cheese?

11:18.700 --> 11:20.036
Cheese!

11:25.740 --> 11:27.375
How is everything, gang?

11:27.377 --> 11:29.041
Incredible.

11:29.043 --> 11:30.810
I'm stuffed.

11:30.812 --> 11:34.316
Well, I think Shaggy
and Scooby are in hog heaven.

11:39.287 --> 11:41.957
More hog.

11:42.425 --> 11:43.723
Heavenly.

11:43.725 --> 11:45.758
Wow! These two can really eat.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.727
Um, don't you think
you guys should slow down?

11:48.729 --> 11:51.564
Not if we're gonna finish
all this before bed!

11:51.566 --> 11:54.267
Enjoy it now, guys,
'cause starting tomorrow,

11:54.269 --> 11:56.102
like all the rest
of the guests here,

11:56.104 --> 11:57.838
we'll be cooking
our own meals.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.205
- Huh?
- Huh?

11:59.207 --> 12:01.074
Are you gonna coach us,
Uncle B?

12:01.076 --> 12:03.410
No. As we say in the biz,
my plate's full.

12:03.412 --> 12:05.612
So, you'll be working with
my sous-chef

12:05.614 --> 12:07.314
or, my second-in-command.

12:07.316 --> 12:10.516
- But I should warn you...
- Who's there?

12:11.553 --> 12:13.252
Kids, this is
the groundskeeper,

12:13.254 --> 12:15.689
Jeremiah Noseworthy.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.857
It's "Nosay-worthy."

12:17.859 --> 12:20.361
"Nosay," from the Latin.

12:20.363 --> 12:22.465
Why would it be "Nose"?

12:22.898 --> 12:24.531
Huh?

12:24.533 --> 12:26.032
Um...

12:26.034 --> 12:28.669
Uh, hello, Mr. Nosay-worthy.

12:28.671 --> 12:31.304
I'm Fred, and this is Daphne,
Velma...

12:31.306 --> 12:33.305
A little late for a barbecue.

12:33.307 --> 12:34.974
We were just finishing up.

12:34.976 --> 12:36.977
Oh, see that you do.

12:36.979 --> 12:40.079
Unless you want him
to get you, too.

12:40.081 --> 12:41.815
- "Him" who?
- Oh.

12:41.817 --> 12:43.983
Didn't young Flay here
tell you then?

12:43.985 --> 12:46.486
- Jeremiah, there's no need to say...
- Oh, you're right.

12:46.488 --> 12:49.923
There's no need.
Not now.

12:49.925 --> 12:51.858
You're doomed already.

12:51.860 --> 12:53.493
Wait, didn't I fire you today?

12:53.495 --> 12:55.062
Oh, indeed.

12:55.064 --> 12:57.030
Yeah, I've lived here me whole
life, you know.

12:57.032 --> 13:00.599
Born right there in that
little cottage I sleep in now.

13:00.601 --> 13:03.304
I told you, you can stay
in the cottage, rent-free.

13:03.306 --> 13:05.639
But no more scaring away
the guests.

13:05.641 --> 13:09.476
No! Got to make way
for progress.

13:09.478 --> 13:12.478
'Course, we'll see how long
progress lasts,

13:12.480 --> 13:15.683
now that the Red Ghost is back.

13:15.685 --> 13:19.155
Ah, good night, now.
Sweet dreams.

13:21.157 --> 13:24.123
- "Red Ghost"?
- It's just a silly legend.

13:24.125 --> 13:26.193
New England runs
on old ghost stories.

13:26.195 --> 13:28.596
Well, if there's one thing
we understand,

13:28.598 --> 13:30.930
it's legends
and ghost stories.

13:30.932 --> 13:33.266
Uh, that's two things.

13:33.268 --> 13:34.834
Plus counting.

13:34.836 --> 13:36.136
So, four things.

13:36.138 --> 13:38.203
Come on, Bobby,
spill the beans.

13:38.205 --> 13:40.674
Also,
pass the beans, please.

13:40.676 --> 13:43.876
Well, when Chef Edward
disappeared back in 1780,

13:43.878 --> 13:45.344
he was alone in the inn.

13:45.346 --> 13:48.247
People outside swore
they heard him cry out,

13:48.249 --> 13:50.918
"Red Ghost, Red Ghost,"
over and over.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.819
And no one ever saw him again?

13:52.821 --> 13:54.453
Apparently not.

13:54.455 --> 13:56.891
So, the legend of the Red
Ghost that haunts the inn

13:56.893 --> 13:59.391
was passed down here
in tiny Newport Cove.

13:59.393 --> 14:01.727
To superstitious people
like Noseworthy.

14:01.729 --> 14:03.197
"Nosay-worthy."

14:03.199 --> 14:07.001
Which explains why the place
sat vacant for two centuries.

14:07.003 --> 14:08.669
Of course, it's just a story.

14:08.671 --> 14:11.204
- But since we opened...
- Let me guess.

14:11.206 --> 14:13.040
The Red Ghost has appeared.

14:13.042 --> 14:14.406
Well, that's what
some people say.

14:14.408 --> 14:15.974
But I haven't seen it.

14:15.976 --> 14:18.547
I only believe what I can see
with my own two eyes.

14:23.185 --> 14:26.719
You're right, I should pipe down
and let you kids get to bed.

14:26.721 --> 14:29.524
Anybody want a doggy bag?
I'm looking at you, Scooby.

14:31.759 --> 14:33.626
I brought my own.

14:33.628 --> 14:35.094
Like, ditto.

14:35.096 --> 14:36.398
Nice.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.670
Come on, gang.
We better get inside.

14:43.104 --> 14:44.440
Huh!

15:02.825 --> 15:05.592
Hey, boys,
you forgot your doggy bags.

15:05.594 --> 15:09.262
Who can eat? All I can think
about is that Red Ghost.

15:09.264 --> 15:11.164
Yeah.

15:11.166 --> 15:12.665
Red Ghost.

15:12.667 --> 15:15.836
Oh, you scaredy-cats.
That's just an old myth.

15:15.838 --> 15:17.270
You always say that.

15:17.272 --> 15:20.306
And then we end up running
for our lives.

15:20.308 --> 15:24.713
I think the only thing you two have to be
scared of this weekend is indigestion.

15:26.047 --> 15:27.381
Good night, boys.

15:29.117 --> 15:32.218
Gee, Scooby-Doo, all this
talk about indigestion's

15:32.220 --> 15:33.620
making me hungry.

15:33.622 --> 15:35.789
- Me, too.
- You know what, Scoob,

15:35.791 --> 15:37.656
I'm not going to let
any ghost keep me

15:37.658 --> 15:39.628
from my leftovers.

15:49.604 --> 15:51.474
What the...

15:54.877 --> 15:56.644
Oh, oops!

15:56.646 --> 15:57.680
Sorry.

16:01.048 --> 16:03.982
Like, man, I hope
that kitchen's still open.

16:03.984 --> 16:05.452
I'm starved.

16:05.454 --> 16:07.453
Mmm-mmm.

16:07.455 --> 16:08.889
Be careful, Scoob.

16:08.891 --> 16:11.591
We need to be quiet,
so we don't wake anyone.

16:11.593 --> 16:13.293
- Shh.
- Hmm?

16:13.295 --> 16:14.697
That's right, shh.

16:17.832 --> 16:19.498
Huh?

16:19.500 --> 16:20.802
Shh.

16:22.370 --> 16:24.570
- Hmm?
- You got it, Scoob, old buddy.

16:24.572 --> 16:26.475
We gotta keep it down.

16:30.611 --> 16:32.346
- Huh?
- You know, Scoob, I get it,

16:32.348 --> 16:35.281
but could you "shush"
a little softer?

16:35.283 --> 16:37.217
Me? That was you.

16:37.219 --> 16:40.989
This is no time for games,
Scooby-Doo, I'm famished.

16:46.662 --> 16:48.862
That's right, Scoob,
shush, I get it.

16:48.864 --> 16:51.300
Don't worry,
I think we're here.

16:51.933 --> 16:53.567
Ah!

17:01.609 --> 17:02.976
Mmm.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.377
Sorry, Scoob.

17:04.378 --> 17:06.146
That's nach-yours.

17:06.147 --> 17:07.945
Get it?

17:11.252 --> 17:13.755
It's nach-yours, either!

17:28.569 --> 17:30.273
I thought you didn't share.

17:33.876 --> 17:36.345
Don't worry, Nacho.
We won't tell.

17:39.514 --> 17:40.713
Yeah.

17:40.715 --> 17:42.782
We should hit the hay, Scoob.

17:42.784 --> 17:43.982
Night, Nacho.

17:43.984 --> 17:45.386
Shh.

17:45.388 --> 17:48.323
Yeah, we know, Nacho,
mum's the word.

17:53.795 --> 17:56.663
Nacho makes a tasty sandwich,
right, Scoob?

17:56.665 --> 17:58.501
Delicious.

18:12.615 --> 18:16.148
Hurry up, guys.
The sous-chef's on her way.

18:16.150 --> 18:17.917
She's going to help us prepare
for breakfast

18:17.919 --> 18:20.753
while Bobby preps
for the big show tonight.

18:20.755 --> 18:22.222
Big show?

18:22.224 --> 18:24.991
He's doing a live TV broadcast
to promote the resort

18:24.993 --> 18:27.330
from right here
in the cooking arena.

18:28.830 --> 18:30.763
He'll be live
from coast to coast,

18:30.765 --> 18:32.732
cooking dinner with
the whole country.

18:32.734 --> 18:35.037
And all the chefs here
will be lending a hand.

18:35.971 --> 18:37.436
That's terrific.

18:37.438 --> 18:41.040
I haven't met one chef here
that we don't like.

18:43.445 --> 18:45.111
I am sous-chef

18:45.113 --> 18:46.746
Chef Sue.

18:46.748 --> 18:49.384
Anyone joke about name,
I lock in freezer.

18:51.786 --> 18:54.154
Oh, well,
I wish we could help.

18:54.156 --> 18:56.556
We like our eggs runny
and our sausage plentiful.

18:56.558 --> 18:58.390
Call us when it's ready.

18:58.392 --> 19:00.993
Wait just a minute. Where do
you two think you're going?

19:00.995 --> 19:03.096
Giada De Laurentiis asked
Scoob and me

19:03.098 --> 19:06.732
to be guest speakers for her class
on giant sandwich architecture.

19:06.734 --> 19:10.103
You guys will say anything
to get out of work.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.238
It's true.

19:12.907 --> 19:14.744
No leave. Stay!

19:27.689 --> 19:29.321
Uh... Honest guys,

19:29.323 --> 19:32.692
the sandwich-making dog
said he would be here.

19:32.694 --> 19:35.561
Tonight, the whole world will
be watching live, as we go

19:35.563 --> 19:38.799
inside Newport Cove's new
culinary resort,

19:38.801 --> 19:41.134
honoring its most famous
ancestor,

19:41.136 --> 19:45.238
Revolutionary War hero,
Chef Edward DuFlay.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.840
I'm joined now by
the longtime groundskeeper

19:47.842 --> 19:49.642
here at
the Rocky Harbor Estate,

19:49.644 --> 19:52.444
Mr. Jeremiah Noseworthy.

19:52.446 --> 19:54.982
It's "Nosay"... Oh, right.

19:54.984 --> 19:57.283
So I bet you know everything
about this place.

19:57.285 --> 20:00.252
When we finally get a peek
inside, what do you think

20:00.254 --> 20:02.055
will surprise people the most?

20:02.057 --> 20:04.991
Oh, I'm glad you asked.
Let me think.

20:04.993 --> 20:07.159
- Well...
- It's a lie!

20:07.161 --> 20:08.928
A big fat lie!

20:08.930 --> 20:12.232
There's always,
"that war hero"!

20:12.234 --> 20:14.634
Edward DuFlay was no hero.

20:14.636 --> 20:16.036
He was a traitor, he was.

20:16.038 --> 20:19.571
A vile, disreputable,
low-down traitor!

20:19.573 --> 20:24.476
Okay, um, we're having some... Mic problems.

20:24.478 --> 20:26.448
<i>So, let's take a quick break.</i>

20:29.783 --> 20:32.952
I'm checking out.

20:32.954 --> 20:35.021
I'm useless. I can't sleep.

20:35.023 --> 20:37.857
This Red Ghost thing has me
on pins and needles.

20:37.859 --> 20:40.726
You know how scared
I am of ghosts!

20:40.728 --> 20:42.529
And the color red!

20:49.838 --> 20:51.838
Someone will be with you
in just a second.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.007
You think I'm overreacting,
don't you?

20:54.009 --> 20:55.707
Well, I'm sorry,

20:55.709 --> 20:59.011
but the thought of a Red Ghost on
the loose has me all out of sorts.

20:59.013 --> 21:01.481
My nerves
are totally frayed.

21:01.483 --> 21:03.415
I mean, look at me.

21:03.417 --> 21:05.484
I'm talking to a cat!

21:06.821 --> 21:09.655
I know,
you're right,

21:09.657 --> 21:11.924
I should just take my bags
back to my room,

21:11.926 --> 21:15.761
lie down for a bit.
Let my head clear.

21:15.763 --> 21:19.299
Don't worry, Bob-O, Nacho
talked me into staying.

21:19.301 --> 21:20.836
Good kitty.

21:23.705 --> 21:25.739
Sorry, we're a little
understaffed today.

21:25.741 --> 21:27.440
Do you have, uh, reservations?

21:27.442 --> 21:29.608
About this place? Not one.

21:29.610 --> 21:31.543
Bradley Bass.
I'm in real estate.

21:31.545 --> 21:35.815
I have to tell you, Mr. Flay, you and
your furry friend there are sitting

21:35.817 --> 21:38.818
- on a gold mine.
- Maybe.

21:38.820 --> 21:40.552
Okay, uh, Bass.

21:40.554 --> 21:45.090
Oh, here we go. We've got you
in the north wing. Room 113.

21:45.092 --> 21:46.792
I'll call someone to help
you with your bag...

21:46.794 --> 21:49.561
Oh, no! No, no.
No, that's all right.

21:49.563 --> 21:51.097
I have it.

21:51.099 --> 21:54.367
Bobby, quick. Something
is happening in the arena.

21:54.369 --> 21:56.368
<i>Nyet, nyet, nyet!</i>

21:56.370 --> 21:57.569
Zoinks!

21:59.206 --> 22:00.540
<i>Nyet!</i>

22:00.542 --> 22:01.875
What's going on?

22:01.877 --> 22:03.710
Well, first,
we were chopping onions...

22:03.712 --> 22:05.043
And they eat.

22:05.045 --> 22:06.646
Then,
we were chopping parsley...

22:06.648 --> 22:08.213
And they eat!

22:08.215 --> 22:11.584
Like, man, every great cook
tastes his ingredients.

22:11.586 --> 22:13.252
- Right, Uncle B?
- That's right.

22:13.254 --> 22:16.056
Not just "taste."

22:16.058 --> 22:18.858
They eat all the onion
and all the parsley.

22:18.860 --> 22:21.595
And two pounds
raw biscuit dough.

22:21.597 --> 22:23.428
Okay.

22:23.430 --> 22:26.936
Uh, Sue, why don't you, uh, go
make some more biscuit dough?

22:30.237 --> 22:31.805
And as for you two...

22:31.807 --> 22:33.540
Henry Metcalf!

22:33.542 --> 22:35.876
- Huh?
- He literally wrote the book

22:35.878 --> 22:38.444
on Chef Edward
and the Rocky Harbor Inn.

22:38.446 --> 22:40.012
Oh, my goodness.

22:40.014 --> 22:42.348
Aunt Nancy will be tickled
pink to hear that someone

22:42.350 --> 22:44.651
finally bought a copy
of that book.

22:44.653 --> 22:46.886
Actually,
it's from the library.

22:46.888 --> 22:50.190
- Oh.
- Uh, Henry's been helping out a lot with the restoration.

22:50.192 --> 22:53.960
I bet you know even more about
this place than old Noseworthy.

22:53.962 --> 22:55.662
I saw him on the news.

22:55.664 --> 22:59.633
The gall! Calling Chef Edward
a traitor. The man was a hero.

22:59.635 --> 23:02.935
And not just to the Colonials,
even the British loved him.

23:02.937 --> 23:04.604
And we were at war.

23:04.606 --> 23:06.204
He was that good a cook?

23:06.206 --> 23:09.107
And more, which is actually
why I'm here.

23:09.109 --> 23:10.376
Bobby...

23:10.378 --> 23:13.012
Oh, oh, dear. Excuse me.

23:13.014 --> 23:15.181
Nancy keeps at me
to get rid of this thing.

23:15.183 --> 23:17.782
Half the time, I don't know
what it's buzzing about.

23:17.784 --> 23:19.953
Uh, now, oh, yes, yes.

23:19.955 --> 23:22.688
Bobby, I have a gift for you.

23:22.690 --> 23:24.826
To celebrate
your big show tonight.

23:26.128 --> 23:28.728
Everyone knows your
Uncle Edward was a hero

23:28.730 --> 23:30.930
but few understand why.

23:32.766 --> 23:35.668
<i>You see, in a
time of great civil discord,</i>

23:35.670 --> 23:37.203
<i>when the politics
of independence</i>

23:37.205 --> 23:38.938
<i>turned neighbor
against neighbor,</i>

23:38.940 --> 23:40.839
<i>brother against brother,</i>

23:40.841 --> 23:43.475
<i>Chef Edward hung a sign on the
door of this inn that said...</i>

23:43.477 --> 23:45.779
- <i>"All are welcome."</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

23:45.781 --> 23:49.582
<i>At the height of the war, you'd
see Colonial, French, and yes,</i>

23:49.584 --> 23:51.783
even British soldiers
in here.

23:51.785 --> 23:54.252
Well, not in here, exactly.

23:54.254 --> 23:57.857
Bobby, you've done amazing
things with this place.

23:57.859 --> 23:59.626
But so did your uncle.

23:59.628 --> 24:01.527
Did you know
he invented takeout?

24:01.529 --> 24:04.463
You're kidding. Oh, my hero.

24:04.465 --> 24:08.434
Mmm. Takeout.

24:08.436 --> 24:12.838
Any soldier who dined at the inn,
Chef would, as a personal thank you,

24:12.840 --> 24:15.340
<i>make him wrap up morsels
for the road.</i>

24:15.342 --> 24:18.413
Anything that could
be warmed up over a campfire.

24:23.484 --> 24:26.252
- Parchment?
- Chef Edward's parchment.

24:26.254 --> 24:30.155
This belonged to Uncle Edward?
How do you know?

24:30.157 --> 24:34.261
It's a monogram. "E-D-F."
Hmm.

24:34.263 --> 24:35.461
Oh, Edward DuFlay!

24:35.463 --> 24:38.165
If only he'd written something
on them.

24:38.167 --> 24:39.531
A recipe or two?

24:39.533 --> 24:41.600
Oh, he did more than that.

24:41.602 --> 24:46.739
These are the very sheets he used to
wrap up takeout morsels for soldiers.

24:46.741 --> 24:48.444
They were entrusted to me.

24:49.544 --> 24:52.110
And now,
I entrust them to you.

24:52.112 --> 24:54.749
Henry, I mean, I don't know
what to say.

24:55.817 --> 24:57.751
Say you'll
break a leg tonight.

24:57.753 --> 24:59.519
And give your great-uncle
and this place

24:59.521 --> 25:02.320
- the tribute they deserve.
- I promise.

25:02.322 --> 25:05.724
Hey, why don't you and your
wife sit with us tonight?

25:05.726 --> 25:07.961
Thank you.
We wouldn't miss it.

25:07.963 --> 25:09.529
Oh, blast it,

25:09.531 --> 25:11.063
that's probably her now.

25:11.065 --> 25:13.067
I'll see
you all tonight.

25:14.101 --> 25:15.835
What a sweet old man.

25:15.837 --> 25:18.204
Couldn't have got this place
up and running without him.

25:18.206 --> 25:19.806
Speaking of up and running,

25:19.808 --> 25:22.140
where are Shaggy and Scooby?

25:22.142 --> 25:24.144
<i>Nyet, nyet, nyet!</i>

25:29.384 --> 25:31.784
It is indeed
a star-studded night here

25:31.786 --> 25:34.153
in little Newport Cove,
Rhode Island.

25:34.155 --> 25:36.489
I'm with one of tonight's
featured players,

25:36.491 --> 25:37.924
Chef Giada De Laurentiis.

25:37.926 --> 25:39.559
Giada, this is huge.

25:39.561 --> 25:42.294
It's a really great turnout.
And a fun way to show off

25:42.296 --> 25:45.065
the amazing new Rocky Harbor
Culinary Resort.

25:45.067 --> 25:46.598
What's in store?

25:46.600 --> 25:48.434
State-of-the-art kitchens
like you've never seen.

25:48.436 --> 25:51.503
Automated appliances,
indoor sustainable gardens,

25:51.505 --> 25:55.143
and more. All designed to make
gourmet cooking a destination.

26:01.515 --> 26:04.483
So everyone inside and all
of America will be cooking

26:04.485 --> 26:06.986
alongside you,
and the other chefs?

26:06.988 --> 26:08.788
- Yes...
- Hopefully, you, too, Gail.

26:08.790 --> 26:11.824
I don't know.
My cooking is a horror show.

26:11.826 --> 26:14.193
Nobody wants that tonight.

26:14.195 --> 26:18.367
By the way, your hat is lovely.

26:19.935 --> 26:21.302
Yes, it is.

27:13.288 --> 27:15.524
So, we're going to do this
or what?

27:19.426 --> 27:21.027
We're headed for our table.

27:21.029 --> 27:22.328
Just wanted to say
good luck.

27:22.330 --> 27:24.196
- Thanks, Freddie.
- Shaggy.

27:24.198 --> 27:26.866
Maya and I know
you're a big Giada fan.

27:26.868 --> 27:29.001
But we got a recipe
for roast chicken

27:29.003 --> 27:31.136
that will make you forget
all about it.

27:31.138 --> 27:33.673
- Giada!
- We really need tonight to go well.

27:33.675 --> 27:36.876
Your uncle's put his entire
life savings into this place.

27:36.878 --> 27:38.778
Thanks for that reminder,
Giada.

27:38.780 --> 27:41.647
If you start to lose the crowd, just
bring old Scoob and me on stage.

27:41.649 --> 27:44.751
We've got a food-related
knock-knock joke guaranteed

27:44.753 --> 27:46.284
to knock 'em out.

27:46.286 --> 27:47.854
Knock-knock.

27:47.856 --> 27:49.754
- Like, who's there?
- Beets.

27:49.756 --> 27:51.790
Beets, who?

27:51.792 --> 27:54.161
Beats me! Ha!

27:55.964 --> 27:57.931
It'll knock 'em out,
all right.

27:57.933 --> 27:59.665
I'm nodding off already.

27:59.667 --> 28:01.069
Good luck, everyone.

28:12.179 --> 28:15.048
<i>A round of applause
for Giada De Laurentiis</i>

28:15.050 --> 28:18.818
<i>and her bucatini pasta salad!</i>

28:18.820 --> 28:21.521
<i>All right, how's everybody's
bird looking?</i>

28:21.523 --> 28:23.388
<i>Everything's looking
good up here.</i>

28:23.390 --> 28:25.524
<i>We just want to check
the internal temperature</i>

28:25.526 --> 28:28.027
<i>and make sure we're at
160 degrees.</i>

28:28.029 --> 28:29.261
<i>Very important.</i>

28:29.263 --> 28:30.896
Everything's going great.

28:30.898 --> 28:33.398
And they haven't even shown
off the fancy stuff yet.

28:33.400 --> 28:37.669
<i>So for our home viewers, now's the time
to stick that meat thermometer in.</i>

28:37.671 --> 28:42.407
<i>But for everybody here at the
state-of-the-art Rocky Harbor,</i>

28:42.409 --> 28:45.344
<i>all we need to do
is wait until...</i>

28:45.346 --> 28:47.546
- <i>Skip.</i>
- <i>Yeah, Rocky?</i>

28:47.548 --> 28:52.117
<i>Your chicken has reached an internal
temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

28:52.119 --> 28:53.619
<i>Your chicken is ready.</i>

28:53.621 --> 28:55.119
<i>Wow, huh?</i>

28:55.121 --> 28:57.089
<i>Thank you, Rocky.</i>

28:57.091 --> 29:00.225
<i>Take it out and let me know when
it's rested for 10 minutes.</i>

29:00.227 --> 29:01.996
Ooh.

29:08.069 --> 29:09.404
<i>Pretty cool, huh?</i>

29:16.511 --> 29:18.110
<i>Don't worry about that.</i>

29:18.112 --> 29:21.481
<i>Lots of stuff uses electricity
around here.</i>

29:26.119 --> 29:27.854
<i>Sorry about that, everyone.</i>

29:27.856 --> 29:30.388
<i>Gotta make sure we pay
that power bill.</i>

29:33.427 --> 29:36.161
<i>Knock-knock?
Who's there, Skip?</i>

29:36.163 --> 29:37.996
<i>Uh, beets... Beats me!</i>

29:37.998 --> 29:39.464
<i>I mean...</i>

29:39.466 --> 29:41.701
<i>There's a beet
at the door... Oh!</i>

29:49.377 --> 29:51.042
- Oh.
- Oh, great.

29:53.281 --> 29:54.780
Red Ghost!

29:54.782 --> 29:56.650
All right, all right,
it's not a...

29:59.087 --> 30:00.386
Did you hear that?

30:10.965 --> 30:12.732
Red Ghost!

30:12.734 --> 30:14.035
Shh.

30:17.738 --> 30:20.475
- Pay attention.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

30:37.492 --> 30:38.857
Bella.

30:38.859 --> 30:41.059
- Shh.
- Why is it shushing us?

30:41.061 --> 30:43.428
I know. Maybe it's the ghost
of a librarian.

30:43.430 --> 30:46.133
Who cares! Just do what
he says and hush up.

31:04.218 --> 31:05.553
Out of my way!

31:15.362 --> 31:17.131
Shh.

31:19.466 --> 31:21.500
It's coming right for us.

31:21.502 --> 31:22.768
Shh.

31:22.770 --> 31:24.539
Oh! Shush, yourself!

32:01.074 --> 32:02.643
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

32:06.680 --> 32:10.715
Next year,
I get the pick the vacation.

32:10.717 --> 32:12.751
Your guess is as good
as mine, Larry.

32:12.753 --> 32:16.187
Right now, no one from
the resort is talking.

32:16.189 --> 32:17.757
All we really know
at this point is

32:17.759 --> 32:20.559
<i>what we saw play out
in the arena and on TV.</i>

32:20.561 --> 32:23.963
<i>No injuries, but a lot
of scared folks.</i>

32:23.965 --> 32:27.232
<i>A team of paranormal
investigators are on the scene.</i>

32:27.234 --> 32:31.336
<i>Just who they are and what they're doing
right now about this serious situation</i>

32:31.338 --> 32:34.139
<i>remains a mystery.</i>

32:34.141 --> 32:35.774
So this is really
what you kids do?

32:35.776 --> 32:37.409
Literally,
all the time.

32:37.411 --> 32:39.212
And you've actually
caught ghosts?

32:39.214 --> 32:41.646
Let's just say, we always
get our man.

32:41.648 --> 32:44.215
Do you mind if we look around
the inn for clues?

32:44.217 --> 32:46.351
Go ahead.
The place is deserted.

32:46.353 --> 32:48.052
Did someone say "dessert"?

32:48.054 --> 32:49.722
Yum.

32:49.724 --> 32:52.825
How can you two think of food
at a time like this?

32:52.827 --> 32:55.927
How can we think of anything but
food, in a place like this?

32:55.929 --> 32:58.665
You know, Shaggy and Scooby
are right. We need omelets.

32:58.667 --> 33:00.898
Whenever I get stressed,
I make omelets.

33:00.900 --> 33:04.603
Ah, make mine a vegetarian
Denver, but hold the onions.

33:04.605 --> 33:06.871
- And the peppers.
- So, just eggs?

33:06.873 --> 33:08.776
Yeah, you're right.
Hold the eggs.

33:11.712 --> 33:12.978
Not again.

33:12.980 --> 33:15.246
It's like everything
electronic in this place

33:15.248 --> 33:17.014
has gone haywire
since last night.

33:17.016 --> 33:19.751
<i>Hay... Hay...
Haywire. Haywire.</i>

33:19.753 --> 33:21.990
<i>Hay... Hay...
Haywire.</i>

33:37.405 --> 33:41.507
Thanks. In between hosting TV
shows and writing best-sellers,

33:41.509 --> 33:43.108
I've been studying
martial arts,

33:43.110 --> 33:46.745
parkour and Ultimate Frisbee,
you know, just in case.

33:46.747 --> 33:49.514
Whoa.
Thanks, Nacho.

33:49.516 --> 33:51.383
<i>Hay... Hay...
Haywire.</i>

33:57.323 --> 34:00.592
What could be causing the
appliances to suddenly go bonkers?

34:00.594 --> 34:04.863
Well, ghosts have long been known
to exhibit electrical phenomena.

34:04.865 --> 34:06.999
She's right.

34:07.001 --> 34:10.302
Well, thanks. I'm also fascinated
with all things supernatural.

34:10.304 --> 34:13.371
We need to find
this Red Ghost.

34:13.373 --> 34:17.043
And my poor scared Bella. Who
knows where she ran off to?

34:25.185 --> 34:28.387
Don't worry, Giada.
We'll find her, too.

34:28.389 --> 34:30.655
- Let's split up.
- Good idea.

34:30.657 --> 34:32.724
Daphne, Velma and I
will search the ground.

34:32.726 --> 34:35.561
Uncle Bobby, Shaggy and Scooby
will search the inn.

34:35.563 --> 34:39.197
Uh, which team do you want to
be on, Miss De Laurentiis?

34:39.199 --> 34:41.467
Oh, please, Fred.
Call me Giada.

34:42.703 --> 34:44.003
I better go with the boys.

34:44.005 --> 34:45.871
They need all the help
they can get.

34:45.873 --> 34:47.473
What about me?

34:47.475 --> 34:49.308
Well, somebody needs
to answer the phones.

34:49.310 --> 34:51.210
- Can you do that?
- Uh,

34:51.212 --> 34:52.777
how many phones?

34:52.779 --> 34:54.346
You know what, never mind.

34:54.348 --> 34:55.614
I got this.

34:55.616 --> 34:57.483
I know how to answer a phone.

34:57.485 --> 34:59.451
It's not like I never answered
a phone before in my life.

34:59.453 --> 35:01.453
I got it, Bobby.

35:01.455 --> 35:03.454
When the phone rings, I'm going to answer it.

35:03.456 --> 35:05.926
- No matter how many... Ooh!
- Now, Skip!

35:07.795 --> 35:09.563
Ah, it's okay. They hung up.

35:12.933 --> 35:14.699
Uh-uh. No way!

35:14.701 --> 35:18.270
Sorry, Nacho. Scooby's not about
to become a passenger vehicle.

35:18.272 --> 35:20.773
Especially for a C-A-T.

35:22.109 --> 35:25.112
He wants to know if you'll
do it for a Nacho snack.

35:26.980 --> 35:28.279
Nacho snack?

35:28.281 --> 35:29.683
Mmm-mmm.

35:31.085 --> 35:34.721
How about that? Dude, they're
nach-your chips!

35:34.723 --> 35:38.023
Get it.
They're my chips.

35:38.025 --> 35:40.625
Bella! Bella!

35:40.627 --> 35:42.427
So what are
we looking for, exactly?

35:42.429 --> 35:44.295
I think we better talk turkey.

35:44.297 --> 35:45.663
All right,
give it to me straight.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.132
Dry versus wet brining.

35:47.134 --> 35:49.567
Which technique will bring
my Thanksgiving bird

35:49.569 --> 35:51.904
from blah to ta-da?

36:00.681 --> 36:03.081
Okay, nobody panic.

36:03.083 --> 36:04.916
Where're you guys going?

36:04.918 --> 36:06.418
That way.

36:06.420 --> 36:09.020
Yeah. Like, away from danger.

36:09.022 --> 36:10.855
You guys,
we've gotta press on.

36:10.857 --> 36:12.592
If we don't catch
the Red Ghost,

36:12.594 --> 36:15.126
this whole place is ruined.

36:15.128 --> 36:19.163
All right, but don't say
we didn't warn you.

36:19.165 --> 36:22.366
Hang on, you guys carry
flashlights wherever you go?

36:22.368 --> 36:24.302
- Uh-huh.
- Tools of the trade.

36:24.304 --> 36:27.239
Isn't there something
you never leave home without?

36:27.241 --> 36:29.340
- Tongs.
- Fennel.

36:29.342 --> 36:33.415
Oh, great. Well, when we catch the Red
Ghost, you two can make us pork chops.

36:36.384 --> 36:40.251
That's right. We have no official
comment on the incident.

36:40.253 --> 36:43.087
We're going to let the
investigators do their job,

36:43.089 --> 36:46.023
and once we have their findings,
we'll make a statement.

36:46.025 --> 36:48.159
That's all I can say
at this time.

36:48.161 --> 36:49.728
Now, can you please

36:49.730 --> 36:51.563
tell me where my pizza is?

36:51.565 --> 36:53.967
I ordered from you nearly an hour ago.

36:54.969 --> 36:56.567
He hung up!

36:56.569 --> 36:57.969
Can I help you?

36:57.971 --> 36:59.637
I'd like to be turned down.

36:59.639 --> 37:02.108
The answer is no!

37:02.110 --> 37:03.875
This job's
easier than I thought.

37:03.877 --> 37:06.011
I mean, I'd like maid service.

37:06.013 --> 37:08.848
Never mind. I'm waiting
for a delivery.

37:08.850 --> 37:11.116
I hope it's not from
Papa Blando's Pizza,

37:11.118 --> 37:13.819
- or you're going to be waiting a while.
- Who are you?

37:13.821 --> 37:16.320
Where's Flay?
Is he in the arena?

37:16.322 --> 37:19.123
Uh, no, no, actually, sir,
you can't go in there!

37:19.125 --> 37:22.464
It's still a mess from...
Stop! Please, turn around!

37:28.268 --> 37:29.837
What should we be looking for?

37:31.639 --> 37:33.074
Jeepers!

37:37.679 --> 37:40.512
- You are nephew!
- Um...

37:40.514 --> 37:43.081
- Yeah.
- Phone is ringing off hook.

37:43.083 --> 37:44.583
Nobody.

37:44.585 --> 37:47.018
- Wasn't Skip Taylor supposed...
- No Skip Taylor!

37:47.020 --> 37:48.253
That's odd.

37:48.255 --> 37:50.956
Chef Sue not guest relations.

37:50.958 --> 37:53.491
Chef Sue busy making
fish-head stew!

37:53.493 --> 37:56.527
Okay, okay, you did the
right thing by scaring me.

37:56.529 --> 37:58.931
Uh, getting me.

37:58.933 --> 38:00.766
Sorry, gang, you're on
your own.

38:00.768 --> 38:02.536
The family business needs me.

38:03.737 --> 38:05.904
Come on, Daphne, let's...
Oh!

38:05.906 --> 38:09.009
- My glasses!
- Don't panic. I see them.

38:10.210 --> 38:11.710
What's this?

38:11.712 --> 38:14.012
It looks like some sort
of an electrical cable.

38:14.014 --> 38:15.279
A big one,

38:15.281 --> 38:17.815
leading from the inn to...

38:17.817 --> 38:19.751
The groundskeeper's cottage.

38:19.753 --> 38:22.853
I wonder if old Nosey-worthy
is sill here.

38:22.855 --> 38:24.758
Only one way to find out.

38:25.926 --> 38:27.293
Have we talked
about LASIK?

38:27.295 --> 38:29.664
Yes, and I'm still
not a candidate.

38:30.764 --> 38:33.032
Wow. Like, where are we?

38:33.034 --> 38:34.733
It's Chef Edward's study.

38:34.735 --> 38:36.634
Most everything
in here is original.

38:36.636 --> 38:39.771
We just polished it up for the tourists.
Even the books were here.

38:39.773 --> 38:41.974
You thinking
what I'm thinking, Scoob?

38:41.976 --> 38:43.144
Uh-huh.

38:59.793 --> 39:01.592
What are you guys doing?

39:01.594 --> 39:04.630
It's our experience that in a
creepy old study like this,

39:04.632 --> 39:06.732
in a creepy old inn like this,

39:06.734 --> 39:08.900
there's always
a secret passageway.

39:08.902 --> 39:13.774
And the sooner we find it, the
sooner we can have those pork chops.

39:26.652 --> 39:29.087
Where the heck
is Skip Taylor?

39:29.089 --> 39:31.724
It's not like a TV personality

39:31.726 --> 39:34.994
to flake out
on their responsibilities.

39:34.996 --> 39:37.329
Huh!

39:37.331 --> 39:41.032
Rocky Harbor Inn and Culinary Resort,
can I put you on hold, please?

39:41.034 --> 39:44.103
Rocky Harbor Inn,
please hold.

39:44.105 --> 39:47.907
RHI, your call is important
to us, please hold.

39:47.909 --> 39:49.641
Well, good afternoon, Fred.

39:49.643 --> 39:50.976
Have we met?

39:50.978 --> 39:52.911
Oh, of course not.
You'd remember.

39:52.913 --> 39:55.547
I've just heard so much
about you from your uncle.

39:55.549 --> 39:57.116
Oh, are you one
of his friends?

39:57.118 --> 39:59.650
No. Just a business associate.

39:59.652 --> 40:01.386
Tell me something. Personally,

40:01.388 --> 40:04.355
do you think he'd ever
give up this place?

40:04.357 --> 40:06.425
Uncle Bobby?

40:06.427 --> 40:09.261
I'd think you'd have to drag him
out of here kicking and screaming.

40:09.263 --> 40:12.230
That's exactly what I think.

40:12.232 --> 40:14.433
Please have him call me
at his earliest convenience.

40:14.435 --> 40:17.369
I have an offer I'd like him
to consider.

40:17.371 --> 40:19.438
Sure thing.
Hey, you haven't seen

40:19.440 --> 40:21.907
TV's Skip Taylor lurking around
here anywhere, have you?

40:21.909 --> 40:23.574
I don't know who that is.

40:23.576 --> 40:25.009
Oh, by the way,

40:25.011 --> 40:27.179
I'm expecting
a very important delivery.

40:27.181 --> 40:29.947
Please have it sent to my room
the instant it arrives.

40:29.949 --> 40:32.384
All right? There's a good lad.

40:32.386 --> 40:34.386
Bye-bye.

40:35.656 --> 40:38.056
Rocky Harbor Resort,
this is Fred.

40:38.058 --> 40:41.826
Reservations?
Um, I guess that's me.

40:41.828 --> 40:44.429
What's your last name?

40:44.431 --> 40:46.632
"Nosay-worthy."

40:46.634 --> 40:49.268
Of course,
Nosay-worthy.

40:49.270 --> 40:50.969
You were Nosay-ing?

40:50.971 --> 40:52.306
Just a little joke.

40:54.275 --> 40:57.076
Oh, that DuFlay was nothing
but a traitor.

40:57.078 --> 41:00.145
My family has tended grounds
here for generations.

41:00.147 --> 41:03.248
And the stories
have been passed, oh, yes.

41:03.250 --> 41:07.351
The man was a sympathizer
to the Crown.

41:07.353 --> 41:10.422
It's all written down there
in his personal papers,

41:10.424 --> 41:13.025
which we're not allowed
to inspect,

41:13.027 --> 41:15.763
since that lousy Henry Metcalf

41:16.998 --> 41:20.364
had the entire Noseworthy
family banned

41:20.366 --> 41:21.967
from the library.

41:21.969 --> 41:23.404
Sunflower seed?

41:25.940 --> 41:29.974
Oh, I'm sorry, we caught you in
the middle of moving, didn't we?

41:31.145 --> 41:33.645
Well, I, uh...
Well... Yes.

41:33.647 --> 41:37.549
We're sorry to disturb you, sir, but we
really just wanted to ask if you know

41:37.551 --> 41:40.117
- what this cable's for?
- The wha... The cable, oh.

41:40.119 --> 41:45.389
Well, probably something to do with all
that blasted technology Flay brought in.

41:45.391 --> 41:47.960
And this junction box?

41:47.962 --> 41:50.728
Oh, supplies all the power
to the inn.

41:50.730 --> 41:55.500
Place still ain't properly wired
up for them modern conveniences.

41:55.502 --> 41:57.235
It's a temporary fix,

41:57.237 --> 42:00.475
but one I ain't got to
worry about no more.

42:02.409 --> 42:06.045
Anyway, what's that got to
do with DuFlay, the traitor?

42:06.047 --> 42:09.081
You don't gotta take my word
for it, do you?

42:09.083 --> 42:12.150
All you need to do is go
to the library

42:12.152 --> 42:14.152
and look at his papers.

42:14.154 --> 42:17.621
Thank you, for your time,
Mr. Nose... Mr. No...

42:17.623 --> 42:19.757
Jeremiah.

42:19.759 --> 42:21.994
"Jere-mee-ah," from the Greek.

42:21.996 --> 42:23.195
Oh, come on!

42:23.197 --> 42:24.895
All right, let's go.

42:24.897 --> 42:27.565
Well, how can you catch
that fiery demon

42:27.567 --> 42:31.737
if you don't know why it came
for DuFLay in the first place?

42:31.739 --> 42:34.108
Why, it's coming
for us all now!

42:36.810 --> 42:38.911
Like, man,
I don't get it.

42:38.913 --> 42:42.012
There is always
a secret passageway!

42:43.951 --> 42:46.784
Yes, uh, hello.
Is that Skip? Freddie?

42:50.424 --> 42:51.889
Uh, guys...

42:51.891 --> 42:53.558
- What is it?
- My phone.

42:53.560 --> 42:56.229
What were you saying about
electrical phenomena?

42:56.929 --> 42:58.996
You guys, I think...

42:58.998 --> 43:00.232
Don't say it.

43:00.234 --> 43:01.936
I think the ghost is...

43:02.703 --> 43:04.703
...in this room.

43:12.612 --> 43:14.679
A trapdoor.

43:14.681 --> 43:17.549
What do you want to wager that whatever
we're looking for, is down there?

43:17.551 --> 43:19.384
Chateaubriand?

43:19.386 --> 43:22.219
With caramelized shallots and a
demi-glace and all the trimmings?

43:22.221 --> 43:24.889
Oh, I love Chateaubriand.
Good wager.

43:24.891 --> 43:27.860
- I'm in.
- Um, we're trying to do something here.

43:27.862 --> 43:31.264
Also, what's wrong with a nice
leafy salad, now and then?

43:34.467 --> 43:35.569
Here goes nothing.

43:39.906 --> 43:41.639
You're right, it's nothing.

43:41.641 --> 43:43.310
Scooby, your flashlight.

43:59.493 --> 44:00.958
Like, run!

44:00.960 --> 44:02.964
Shh.

44:15.875 --> 44:18.175
Here's the last one.

44:18.177 --> 44:21.179
Though I'm not sure why this schedule
of Colonial army troop movements

44:21.181 --> 44:26.150
circa 1778 to 1781 would make
mention of Chef Edward or his inn.

44:26.152 --> 44:29.987
And I don't know why Noseworthy
thinks DuFlay was a traitor

44:29.989 --> 44:34.159
or what that has to do with a ghost
shutting down Bobby's live broadcast.

44:34.161 --> 44:35.761
But I'm still looking.

44:35.763 --> 44:38.329
You're right.
Everything's a potential clue.

44:38.331 --> 44:40.098
We just need to keep
our eyes open.

44:40.100 --> 44:43.270
Shh.

44:46.572 --> 44:49.007
Whew. I thought that was
you-know-who.

44:49.009 --> 44:51.876
I'm going to take a closer look
at that Chef Edward exhibit

44:51.878 --> 44:53.344
we passed on the way in.

44:53.346 --> 44:55.313
The one with
the lemon-juice bottle?

44:55.315 --> 44:56.949
Didn't seem too promising.

44:56.951 --> 44:59.353
I know.
But maybe we missed something.

45:10.330 --> 45:13.134
Lemon juice...
Velma's right.

45:16.369 --> 45:17.438
Hang on.

45:19.605 --> 45:20.806
Excuse me.

45:20.808 --> 45:22.808
Is there another Chef Edward
exhibit here?

45:22.810 --> 45:24.942
I'm afraid not. Why?

45:24.944 --> 45:28.512
It's just that I heard the library
has Chef Edward's personal papers.

45:28.514 --> 45:30.782
Why wouldn't those be included
in the display?

45:30.784 --> 45:34.485
I'm afraid the only paper I
know about is the parchment.

45:34.487 --> 45:37.855
The parchment Mr. Metcalf
gave Bobby at the inn?

45:37.857 --> 45:41.025
Anyway, those are just
blank pieces of parchment.

45:41.027 --> 45:44.896
Not much information to be
gleamed from them, I'm afraid.

45:44.898 --> 45:47.431
Still...
Thank you, ma'am.

45:47.433 --> 45:49.067
Shh.

45:55.543 --> 45:58.143
I can't breathe
in this thing.

45:58.145 --> 45:59.978
Me neither.

45:59.980 --> 46:01.779
Come on, Scooby,
move it.

46:04.884 --> 46:06.286
Oh, like...

46:08.855 --> 46:12.657
I don't understand why we all
had to pile into the same vase.

46:12.659 --> 46:16.130
Like, man, it looks like
not everyone did.

46:25.072 --> 46:27.105
- Uh-oh.
- What is it, Scooby-Doo?

46:27.107 --> 46:29.373
Your keen hearing
picking something up?

46:29.375 --> 46:32.277
- Shh.
- Right. Sorry.

46:32.279 --> 46:34.579
What do you hear?

46:34.581 --> 46:36.517
No. "Shh."

46:37.784 --> 46:40.250
Still too loud, huh?

46:40.252 --> 46:42.088
- No.
- No?

46:47.993 --> 46:49.329
Shh.

46:54.701 --> 46:56.567
Well, what do you think?

46:56.569 --> 47:00.038
I don't think we're any
closer to solving this mystery now

47:00.040 --> 47:02.206
than we were when we started.

47:04.777 --> 47:06.179
Shh.

47:09.116 --> 47:10.418
Sorry.

47:11.985 --> 47:14.188
- It's Fred.
- <i>Hey, gang.</i>

47:15.522 --> 47:17.855
Freddie, are you wearing
coveralls?

47:17.857 --> 47:22.326
Whoo! I had no idea this place
required so much upkeep.

47:22.328 --> 47:23.929
What are you doing?

47:23.931 --> 47:28.199
Solving the mystery of the
leaky downstairs faucet.

47:28.201 --> 47:32.170
<i>Anyway, I'm just calling to see
if you've heard from Shaggy or Scooby.</i>

47:32.172 --> 47:33.605
- They're not there?
- <i>No.</i>

47:33.607 --> 47:35.540
<i>And neither is Skip Taylor.</i>

47:35.542 --> 47:38.175
<i>I'm starting to get worried.
You should probably head back.</i>

47:38.177 --> 47:39.744
<i>We're on our way.</i>

47:39.746 --> 47:42.346
Oh, and if you happen to pass
a hardware store en route,

47:42.348 --> 47:44.081
could you pick me up
a lug nut,

47:44.083 --> 47:45.683
and also I need
another pair of...

47:45.685 --> 47:47.554
Run!

47:50.223 --> 47:52.790
Huh. That question's answered.

47:52.792 --> 47:55.427
- Anyway, get back soon.
- <i>Will do.</i>

47:55.429 --> 47:57.197
I think we lost him.

48:03.369 --> 48:04.839
Come on. Seriously?

48:07.540 --> 48:09.409
Oh, nuh-uh.

48:15.949 --> 48:18.150
Uh, what happened to me?

48:18.152 --> 48:19.684
I lost consciousness and...

48:19.686 --> 48:21.522
Oh, wait, I remember,
I took a nap.

48:22.589 --> 48:24.458
Hey, why were you blocking
the door?

48:34.333 --> 48:37.069
Hmm. Cookies.

48:37.071 --> 48:38.936
Made the old-fashioned way,

48:38.938 --> 48:41.442
since the hi-tech stuff's
still on the fritz.

48:42.342 --> 48:44.509
This day has been a disaster.

48:44.511 --> 48:46.478
The library was a bust.

48:46.480 --> 48:48.179
And I put in a full workday.

48:48.181 --> 48:50.081
And Bella's still lost.

48:50.083 --> 48:52.183
Oh, I hope she's okay.

48:52.185 --> 48:54.219
Is Bella the one
with the glasses?

48:54.221 --> 48:55.820
No. That'd be me.

48:55.822 --> 48:58.590
- I'm Velma.
- I'm pretty sure you're Fred.

48:58.592 --> 49:01.092
None of this makes any sense.

49:01.094 --> 49:04.462
Why would a ghost want to ruin
a live television broadcast?

49:04.464 --> 49:07.431
Yeah. And why is he always
shushing everybody quiet?

49:07.433 --> 49:10.802
I think, Noseworthy knows
more than he's Nosay-ing.

49:10.804 --> 49:12.737
He has lived here
his whole life.

49:12.739 --> 49:14.875
You think he'd seen
the Red Ghost before.

49:16.676 --> 49:19.342
Rocky, set timer
for nine minutes.

49:19.344 --> 49:23.250
<i>Timer set for
900 minutes.</i>

49:25.319 --> 49:27.985
Better just watch the clock.

49:27.987 --> 49:29.820
Whoops. Uh, it's okay.

49:29.822 --> 49:31.556
That's what
the auto-vac's for.

49:31.558 --> 49:33.860
Um, I'm not sure you should...

49:54.547 --> 49:57.248
I also studied gymnastic
discus throwing.

49:57.250 --> 49:59.317
Just returning
the favor, Nach.

49:59.319 --> 50:00.821
How were the cookies, gang?

50:02.022 --> 50:03.958
Delicious.

50:07.192 --> 50:12.232
Mmm! These are good enough to lick the
parchment paper they were baked on.

50:13.433 --> 50:15.500
I wouldn't do that.

50:15.502 --> 50:19.003
Bobby, you didn't by chance
accidentally use one of Chef Edward's

50:19.005 --> 50:20.404
parchment sheets, did you?

50:20.406 --> 50:22.542
Of course, not.
That would be...

50:28.114 --> 50:31.584
- Uh-oh.
- I think you'll want to come take a look at this.

50:32.485 --> 50:34.284
I don't understand.

50:34.286 --> 50:36.987
There wasn't any writing on it
before you put it in the oven.

50:36.989 --> 50:39.324
Of course! At the library.

50:39.326 --> 50:42.559
- Chef Edward's lemon-juice bottle.
- You're kidding?

50:42.561 --> 50:44.429
During the Revolutionary War,

50:44.431 --> 50:47.130
spies would send messages
written in invisible ink,

50:47.132 --> 50:49.500
which was really just
citrus juice that dried clear.

50:49.502 --> 50:53.771
Oh, so the paper would taste good if they
had to hide it in their mouths, right?

50:53.773 --> 50:58.942
No, so that when the paper was heated,
the citrus would oxidize and turn brown,

50:58.944 --> 51:00.945
so it could be read.

51:00.947 --> 51:03.514
Everyone's been looking for Chef Edward's
personal papers, thinking it was

51:03.516 --> 51:06.016
a diary or legal documents.

51:06.018 --> 51:09.686
But his personal papers were actually
this set of personalized parchment

51:09.688 --> 51:12.155
he used to wrap up to-go food
for soldiers.

51:12.157 --> 51:15.362
But why would he write
to soldiers in invisible ink?

51:16.864 --> 51:18.999
- Hmm.
- What is it?

51:20.699 --> 51:22.933
- What's it say?
- It looks like

51:22.935 --> 51:26.036
detailed information
about troop movements.

51:26.038 --> 51:28.739
Are you saying Uncle Edward
was a spy?

51:28.741 --> 51:30.978
- It would seem so.
- Cool.

51:33.380 --> 51:35.146
Huh?

51:35.148 --> 51:38.183
These are
Continental Army troop movements.

51:38.185 --> 51:39.753
American troops.

51:40.987 --> 51:43.054
Shh.

51:43.056 --> 51:46.157
No, Scooby. Fred and Bobby
need to hear this.

51:46.159 --> 51:49.059
I'm sorry, guys, but there's
only one kind of soldier

51:49.061 --> 51:51.896
for whom this would be
useful information.

51:51.898 --> 51:54.766
A British soldier.

51:54.768 --> 51:57.668
Your Uncle Edward was a spy
during the Revolution.

51:57.670 --> 51:59.471
But not for the Colonies.

51:59.473 --> 52:00.704
For England.

52:00.706 --> 52:02.907
Jeremiah Noseworthy is right.

52:02.909 --> 52:05.509
Chef Edward DuFlay
was a traitor.

52:19.426 --> 52:22.027
You're sure you left the rest of
the parchment on the counter?

52:22.029 --> 52:25.329
- Absolutely.
- I bet someone swiped them when we weren't looking.

52:25.331 --> 52:27.431
Nobody saw anything?

52:27.433 --> 52:30.333
Wait a minute. Has anybody
seen Scooby-Doo?

52:30.335 --> 52:32.038
Or TV's Skip Taylor?

52:34.074 --> 52:36.241
I think we found one of 'em.

52:36.243 --> 52:39.811
Scooby, what are you doing under
the tablecloth, old buddy?

52:39.813 --> 52:41.344
Did you see something scary?

52:42.748 --> 52:44.618
Will you come on out
and tell us about it?

52:50.290 --> 52:51.922
He's too scared to talk.

52:51.924 --> 52:54.527
Do you think you can act
it out, Scoob?

52:58.197 --> 53:03.036
We were all listening to Velma's
analysis of the parchment.

53:04.471 --> 53:06.304
Ooh, then someone walked in.

53:06.306 --> 53:07.674
Mmm-mmm.

53:11.344 --> 53:12.746
The Red Ghost!

53:13.246 --> 53:14.948
Shh.

53:22.020 --> 53:25.056
The ghost stole the parchments
and then sneaked back out.

53:25.058 --> 53:26.891
On the nose.

53:26.893 --> 53:29.259
It's a good thing he did act it
out, because it's given us a clue.

53:29.261 --> 53:32.262
Scooby just tracked through the
flour Bobby spilled earlier.

53:32.264 --> 53:34.965
But there's more than one set
of tracks.

53:34.967 --> 53:36.199
Which means...

53:36.201 --> 53:39.070
The ghost also left a set
of floury footprints.

53:39.072 --> 53:41.404
But ghosts don't walk.
They float.

53:41.406 --> 53:42.940
Exactly.

53:42.942 --> 53:45.610
How many ghosts do you know
that leave footprints?

53:45.612 --> 53:47.579
I don't know
any ghosts, at all.

53:47.581 --> 53:49.179
Well, what are we waiting for?

53:49.181 --> 53:51.752
Let's follow these tracks
before the trail gets cold.

53:56.123 --> 53:57.755
You know, the tongs
aren't helping.

53:57.757 --> 53:59.523
Oh, your fennel is?

53:59.525 --> 54:02.960
Fennel is a well-known repellent
for all things supernatural.

54:02.962 --> 54:05.195
Tongs are pretty much
useless here.

54:05.197 --> 54:06.732
Ha! In your face.

54:17.375 --> 54:20.244
There it is! Upstairs.

54:20.246 --> 54:22.612
Me and Scoob will stay here
to guard the kitchen,

54:22.614 --> 54:24.983
in case he circles
back around.

54:24.985 --> 54:26.019
Yeah.

54:30.723 --> 54:32.090
What are you doing?

54:32.092 --> 54:33.424
You heard Velma.

54:33.426 --> 54:35.596
Fennel wards off evil spirits.

54:37.096 --> 54:39.396
I smell like a zesty
Italian sausage.

54:39.398 --> 54:43.166
Yeah. I'd keep an eye
on Nacho, if I were you.

54:44.603 --> 54:47.006
- Hang on, is that...
- The parchment!

54:49.976 --> 54:51.809
The rooms are all unlocked.

54:51.811 --> 54:53.512
He could have gone
into any of them.

54:53.514 --> 54:56.081
- Shh.
- Wait, did you hear something?

54:56.083 --> 54:58.585
- What is it, Freddie?
- Shh. In here.

55:20.639 --> 55:22.907
- Skip Taylor?
- Oh!

55:22.909 --> 55:25.710
- Oh, hi, gang.
- You scared the wits out of us.

55:25.712 --> 55:27.677
Hey, what's with the mask?

55:27.679 --> 55:29.480
It's for my sleep apnea.

55:29.482 --> 55:31.983
You have difficulty breathing
while you sleep?

55:31.985 --> 55:34.585
Aah, I wouldn't know.
I'm asleep.

55:34.587 --> 55:37.822
So I got a prescription
to wear this, just in case.

55:37.824 --> 55:40.694
Now, kindly pass me
my sugar pills and get out.

55:46.600 --> 55:48.766
- Hmm.
- What is it, Velma?

55:48.768 --> 55:51.001
Since we started chasing
the ghost,

55:51.003 --> 55:52.670
the lights have worked fine.

55:52.672 --> 55:55.172
That's right.
They usually go haywire.

55:55.174 --> 55:57.241
Also,
it didn't shush us once.

55:57.243 --> 55:58.608
Oh, there you are.

55:58.610 --> 56:00.344
Huh? Mr. Bass.

56:00.346 --> 56:02.880
Has that delivery arrived
for me yet, boy?

56:02.882 --> 56:04.715
I'll, uh...
I'll have to check.

56:04.717 --> 56:06.219
Well, see that you do.

56:12.991 --> 56:14.858
Well, Scoob,

56:14.860 --> 56:16.661
it looks like, once again,

56:16.663 --> 56:20.130
pretending to be cowards has
landed us the easiest assignment.

56:20.132 --> 56:21.601
It's true.

56:29.042 --> 56:30.206
Freddie!

56:30.208 --> 56:32.576
Uncle Bobby! Wait, is that
the parchment?

56:32.578 --> 56:34.578
The ghost must have
dropped it.

56:34.580 --> 56:37.982
You know, Flay, if you spent more time
cooking and less time running around

56:37.984 --> 56:39.987
with these meddling kids...

56:42.322 --> 56:44.925
That sounds like Shaggy
and Scooby, come on.

56:51.630 --> 56:52.898
There it is!

56:55.835 --> 56:58.038
- Fennel, fennel.
- I'm all out.

57:00.139 --> 57:01.473
Where did he go?

57:01.475 --> 57:02.842
Did you guys hear something?

57:10.850 --> 57:12.849
It's right outside
the front door.

57:12.851 --> 57:15.187
Everybody, stand back.

57:21.460 --> 57:23.429
A quadcopter delivery drone?

57:29.134 --> 57:31.802
Oh, finally.

57:31.804 --> 57:34.170
- What's this?
- A court order mandating

57:34.172 --> 57:36.607
the immediate closure
of this inn.

57:36.609 --> 57:38.675
What? Why?

57:38.677 --> 57:42.346
"As the home of America's first celebrity
chef, the patriot Edward DuFlay,

57:42.348 --> 57:46.416
"the Rocky Harbor Inn has been
declared an historic landmark."

57:46.418 --> 57:48.085
And, as such,

57:48.087 --> 57:51.621
the place will be put through
a long, rigorous and costly

57:51.623 --> 57:53.424
preservation process.

57:53.426 --> 57:55.358
- Who are you?
- Me?

57:55.360 --> 57:58.795
I'm just a simple investor who's
willing to take this place

57:58.797 --> 58:01.833
and its impending
cost overruns

58:01.835 --> 58:03.601
off your hands,
right here and now.

58:03.603 --> 58:05.136
Come on, Flay.

58:05.138 --> 58:06.971
Take this money and rebuild
your resort somewhere

58:06.973 --> 58:11.375
without any spooky Red Ghosts
chasing away business.

58:11.377 --> 58:15.145
You never cared about the patriotic
legacy of this place, anyway.

58:15.147 --> 58:17.614
You're wrong! You're wrong
about Uncle Bobby,

58:17.616 --> 58:20.985
and unfortunately, you're
wrong about Uncle Edward.

58:20.987 --> 58:24.255
- "Wrong"?
- Chef Edward DuFlay was no patriot.

58:24.257 --> 58:25.459
He was a traitor.

58:28.694 --> 58:32.029
Oh, there's no reason anyone outside
of this group ever needs to know that.

58:32.031 --> 58:33.630
Take the check.

58:33.632 --> 58:35.733
You're not really thinking
about selling the place

58:35.735 --> 58:37.534
to that creep, are you,
Uncle Bobby?

58:37.536 --> 58:40.337
I don't know. At this point, maybe
unloading the place is best.

58:40.339 --> 58:42.674
- Shh.
- I know. I know, you guys.

58:42.676 --> 58:45.779
- It sounds awful to say it out loud, but...
- Shh.

58:47.380 --> 58:48.482
Get him.

58:51.250 --> 58:52.452
Hmm.

59:11.603 --> 59:13.070
A hedge maze?

59:13.072 --> 59:15.242
Like, how are these things
still a thing?

59:19.779 --> 59:21.177
It's a dead end.

59:22.147 --> 59:23.980
Sorry.

59:23.982 --> 59:26.717
Did we say a "dead" end?

59:26.719 --> 59:31.824
We meant "living happily for
several more decades" end.

59:52.210 --> 59:53.911
Who's there?

59:53.913 --> 59:55.947
Mr. Noseworthy.
I need your help.

59:55.949 --> 59:59.416
Oh, actually, I've decided to
start going by "Nose-worthy."

59:59.418 --> 01:00:01.585
It really makes
a lot more sense,

01:00:01.587 --> 01:00:03.154
if you just ignore

01:00:03.156 --> 01:00:04.588
- the Latin...
- Fine!

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:06.359
Just unlock the junction box.

01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:13.132
Hurry. This might be
our only chance.

01:00:20.772 --> 01:00:22.141
Yikes.

01:00:46.132 --> 01:00:47.534
Which way now?

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:52.438
That way.

01:01:08.987 --> 01:01:10.621
Like, thanks, Bobby.

01:01:10.623 --> 01:01:12.092
Thank the tongs.

01:01:12.826 --> 01:01:14.094
Giada.

01:01:20.766 --> 01:01:21.931
Licorice.

01:01:21.933 --> 01:01:23.967
Licorice? Really, Scoob?

01:01:23.969 --> 01:01:26.003
Even I can't eat
at a time like this.

01:01:26.005 --> 01:01:27.204
Shh.

01:01:27.206 --> 01:01:28.905
Wait a second, I smell it too.

01:01:28.907 --> 01:01:30.944
- But that's not licorice. It's...
- Wild fennel.

01:01:33.078 --> 01:01:34.945
It didn't work.
What are we gonna...

01:01:44.891 --> 01:01:46.891
- Bella!
- You're okay.

01:01:46.893 --> 01:01:48.192
She saved us.

01:01:48.194 --> 01:01:49.396
Thanks, Bella.

01:01:50.862 --> 01:01:54.197
So, it's real? The Red Ghost
is a real ghost?

01:01:54.199 --> 01:01:55.933
Not quite, Bobby.

01:01:55.935 --> 01:01:59.337
I figured it out when we got
that delivery back at the inn.

01:01:59.339 --> 01:02:01.871
It's just a drone.

01:02:01.873 --> 01:02:03.440
In a big, billowy cloak.

01:02:03.442 --> 01:02:06.576
The spinning fans not
only make the ghost move,

01:02:06.578 --> 01:02:10.179
the blowing air gives
the cloak its ghostly shape.

01:02:10.181 --> 01:02:12.516
That explains
the shushing sound.

01:02:12.518 --> 01:02:13.552
Now.

01:02:17.757 --> 01:02:19.359
Okay, that's enough.

01:02:22.094 --> 01:02:23.527
Can you hear me?

01:02:23.529 --> 01:02:24.630
<i>Shut it down.</i>

01:02:29.701 --> 01:02:31.400
Yup. A tiny electromagnet,

01:02:31.402 --> 01:02:33.804
designed to emit a pulse
that disrupts the operation

01:02:33.806 --> 01:02:35.338
of nearby electronic devices.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.974
Like walkie-talkies.

01:02:37.976 --> 01:02:40.043
I read. A lot.

01:02:40.045 --> 01:02:42.980
So, as the ghost moved
around the estate,

01:02:42.982 --> 01:02:44.648
the electromagnetic pulse...

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:47.250
Made all the appliances
go haywire.

01:02:47.252 --> 01:02:51.621
So, you're saying it wasn't
supernatural electrical phenomena?

01:02:51.623 --> 01:02:53.090
Nope. Just science.

01:02:55.761 --> 01:02:58.128
But these things
just don't fly themselves.

01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:00.364
Somebody would need
to pilot it remotely.

01:03:00.366 --> 01:03:02.699
Which is how we were able
to shut it down.

01:03:02.701 --> 01:03:06.304
I knew the drone would have to receive its
marching orders via the resort's Internet.

01:03:06.306 --> 01:03:08.338
- Over Wi-fi.
- Right.

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:12.009
So all we had to do was shut down the
Internet routers by cutting off the power.

01:03:12.011 --> 01:03:13.476
Thanks, Mr. Nosay-worthy.

01:03:13.478 --> 01:03:15.813
<i>It's "Nose-worthy"!</i>

01:03:15.815 --> 01:03:17.849
I don't understand.

01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:21.183
How could a delivery drone leave
footprints and steal all that parchment?

01:03:21.185 --> 01:03:22.286
It couldn't.

01:03:22.288 --> 01:03:23.520
Which means...

01:03:23.522 --> 01:03:26.090
There's another Red Ghost.

01:03:26.092 --> 01:03:28.228
And I know just how
to track it.

01:03:42.542 --> 01:03:46.344
What? Elton John's not coming.
We don't even know Elton John.

01:03:46.346 --> 01:03:48.212
We need to make sure
people show up.

01:03:48.214 --> 01:03:49.616
Don't worry. It's covered.

01:03:55.221 --> 01:03:58.521
<i>Mmm. Gourmet barbeque?
Sounds exciting.</i>

01:03:58.523 --> 01:04:00.257
<i>The whole town's invited.</i>

01:04:00.259 --> 01:04:02.525
<i>It will be a new grand opening
for the resort.</i>

01:04:02.527 --> 01:04:07.331
<i>Plus, we're going to reveal some
big news we recently uncovered</i>

01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:09.567
<i>about the town's hero,
Edward DuFlay.</i>

01:04:09.569 --> 01:04:12.804
<i>Aren't you worried about
another attack by the Red Ghost?</i>

01:04:12.806 --> 01:04:16.576
I can assure you, the Red
Ghost will not be a problem.

01:04:19.813 --> 01:04:22.945
<i>Nyet, nyet, nyet.</i>
Not like this.

01:04:22.947 --> 01:04:24.283
Like this.

01:04:56.815 --> 01:04:59.150
<i>I'm live
at the Rocky Harbor Resort,</i>

01:04:59.152 --> 01:05:01.784
<i>site of some strange
goings-on in recent days.</i>

01:05:01.786 --> 01:05:04.556
<i>Tonight, though,
all that seems forgotten.</i>

01:05:52.371 --> 01:05:54.206
Hey, we all have
to start somewhere.

01:05:56.074 --> 01:05:57.273
Yeah!

01:05:57.275 --> 01:05:58.608
Here's another one for you.

01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:01.344
<i>We Didn't Start the Fire.</i>

01:06:01.346 --> 01:06:02.679
That's Billy Joel.

01:06:02.681 --> 01:06:04.114
Really? Where?

01:06:04.116 --> 01:06:06.083
<i>Hello, Newport Cove.</i>

01:06:06.085 --> 01:06:07.384
<i>How's the food?</i>

01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:13.523
<i>All right!</i>

01:06:13.525 --> 01:06:16.293
<i>That's what
our chefs like to hear.</i>

01:06:16.295 --> 01:06:20.530
<i>Folks, this amazing building
here has a lot of great history.</i>

01:06:20.532 --> 01:06:22.433
<i>Just like this town.</i>

01:06:25.404 --> 01:06:27.438
<i>But not all of that history
is great.</i>

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.440
<i>And it's time the people
of this town knew the truth.</i>

01:06:30.442 --> 01:06:32.576
What's she talking about?

01:06:32.578 --> 01:06:36.779
<i>Many of you may have heard the
accusations that Chef Edward DuFlay,</i>

01:06:36.781 --> 01:06:40.750
<i>the man who built this inn,
and many say, this town,</i>

01:06:40.752 --> 01:06:42.820
<i>was a traitor to his country.</i>

01:06:46.359 --> 01:06:48.860
Well, we have some
new information...

01:07:00.406 --> 01:07:04.610
Information that someone here
tonight doesn't want you to have.

01:07:21.427 --> 01:07:22.629
Now, Rocky.

01:08:19.852 --> 01:08:21.649
Wow, Freddie, you were right.

01:08:21.652 --> 01:08:23.752
Gathering the townspeople
and threatening to reveal

01:08:23.755 --> 01:08:26.024
the truth about Chef Edward
did the trick.

01:08:29.093 --> 01:08:31.962
Now let's see who this
Red Ghost really is.

01:08:33.198 --> 01:08:34.430
Noseworthy.

01:08:34.432 --> 01:08:35.799
No, Scooby.

01:08:35.801 --> 01:08:38.269
Mr. Noseworthy helped us
shut down the drone,

01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:39.935
- remember?
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:39.938 --> 01:08:41.671
Uh, Chef Sue?

01:08:41.673 --> 01:08:44.608
What? No, of course not.

01:08:44.609 --> 01:08:47.644
Chef Sue may be tough,
but she's not cr...

01:08:47.645 --> 01:08:51.546
Singer man is right.
Chef Sue innocent.

01:08:51.549 --> 01:08:54.452
Well, she can cook.
That's something.

01:08:54.453 --> 01:08:57.319
So, if it isn't Noseworthy
or Chef Sue,

01:08:57.321 --> 01:08:58.988
and it isn't Skip Taylor...

01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:01.692
- Wait a minute, I was a suspect?
- For a little bit.

01:09:01.694 --> 01:09:03.693
If it isn't them,
then who is it?

01:09:03.694 --> 01:09:07.595
The person who was controlling the
Red Ghost drone from his smartphone

01:09:07.598 --> 01:09:09.966
throughout his stay here.

01:09:09.968 --> 01:09:12.402
Bradley Bass,
the real estate investor.

01:09:12.404 --> 01:09:16.372
Off course. No wonder he wanted
those parchment papers so badly.

01:09:16.374 --> 01:09:18.808
Papers that prove
that Chef Edward DuFlay,

01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:22.211
the hero of Newport Cove,
wasn't a patriot at all,

01:09:22.212 --> 01:09:24.014
but a spy for the British.

01:09:26.451 --> 01:09:29.220
You see, Bass was in a bind.

01:09:29.221 --> 01:09:30.854
He wanted to buy
the inn cheap.

01:09:30.856 --> 01:09:33.157
But he didn't want to damage
DuFlay's reputation

01:09:33.158 --> 01:09:34.991
and keep tourists away.

01:09:34.993 --> 01:09:37.228
So he thought the Red Ghost scare
would motivate me to sell.

01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:40.197
But he was just trading one
set of bad news for another.

01:09:40.198 --> 01:09:43.332
Oh, and I'm not really
Elton John.

01:09:43.334 --> 01:09:45.502
I'm TV's Skip Taylor.

01:09:45.504 --> 01:09:47.470
You're history's
greatest monster.

01:09:51.075 --> 01:09:54.277
If Bass wanted to run this place,
why scare all the tourists away?

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:57.646
As someone who studies real estate
transactions in her spare time,

01:09:57.648 --> 01:09:58.916
I can tell you that's weird.

01:09:58.918 --> 01:10:00.917
Because, Miss De Laurentiis,

01:10:00.919 --> 01:10:03.453
this man is not
in real estate!

01:10:03.455 --> 01:10:05.655
Or even named Bradley Bass.

01:10:05.657 --> 01:10:07.590
Well, off course that's
my name.

01:10:07.592 --> 01:10:09.094
This is preposterous!

01:10:16.067 --> 01:10:17.333
Henry Metcalf?

01:10:17.335 --> 01:10:19.202
The historian.

01:10:19.204 --> 01:10:22.605
Metcalf spent his life building a
career around the story of Chef Edward

01:10:22.607 --> 01:10:24.608
as the hero of Newport Cove.

01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:26.176
But, at some point,

01:10:26.178 --> 01:10:28.310
he must have stumbled
upon the truth.

01:10:28.312 --> 01:10:29.945
<i>But he couldn't
let it get out.</i>

01:10:29.947 --> 01:10:32.049
<i>The DuFlay myth
built this town,</i>

01:10:32.051 --> 01:10:34.551
<i>its families
and his own life's work.</i>

01:10:34.553 --> 01:10:36.552
<i>He needed to protect it.</i>

01:10:36.554 --> 01:10:38.921
<i>Somewhere in his research,
he must have found evidence</i>

01:10:38.923 --> 01:10:42.828
<i>that the Noseworthys were right, and
that Edward DuFlay was a traitor.</i>

01:10:44.463 --> 01:10:46.595
<i>And when he heard
Chef Edward's descendant,</i>

01:10:46.597 --> 01:10:49.899
<i>Bobby Flay, was coming to
town and restoring the place,</i>

01:10:49.901 --> 01:10:51.335
<i>he became frightened.</i>

01:10:51.337 --> 01:10:52.969
<i>Metcalf, like Noseworthy,</i>

01:10:52.971 --> 01:10:55.238
<i>believed the legend that,
hidden in the inn,</i>

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.507
<i>there was a set of personal
papers, written in DuFlay's hand,</i>

01:10:58.509 --> 01:11:00.310
<i>that would incriminate him.</i>

01:11:00.312 --> 01:11:03.346
So it would only be a matter of
time before someone found them.

01:11:03.348 --> 01:11:05.015
But what Metcalf didn't know,

01:11:05.017 --> 01:11:08.252
thanks to some 18th-century
invisible spy tactics,

01:11:08.254 --> 01:11:10.787
was that the handwritten
personal papers

01:11:10.789 --> 01:11:12.890
were the very stack
of parchment sheets

01:11:12.892 --> 01:11:14.858
Metcalf himself gave Bobby.

01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:17.359
Not until I overheard
you kids in the kitchen.

01:11:17.361 --> 01:11:20.965
He didn't want his life's work
to be in service to a turncoat.

01:11:20.967 --> 01:11:23.966
So he brought the Red Ghost
to life to scare away guests,

01:11:23.968 --> 01:11:25.868
close the inn
and keep the secret.

01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:27.970
And I would have gotten
away with it, too,

01:11:27.972 --> 01:11:29.572
- if it weren't for you...
- Hold on.

01:11:29.574 --> 01:11:31.542
We're not quite there yet.

01:11:31.544 --> 01:11:34.144
There's one piece of information
that even you don't know, Henry.

01:11:34.146 --> 01:11:36.880
And it's something I think
Bobby, Fred and the people

01:11:36.882 --> 01:11:38.951
of Newport Cove
deserve to hear.

01:11:40.651 --> 01:11:43.586
I did a more in-depth
analysis of our cookie parchment

01:11:43.588 --> 01:11:45.756
and I believe
when we analyze the rest,

01:11:45.758 --> 01:11:48.125
we'll come
to the same conclusion.

01:11:48.127 --> 01:11:50.760
You see, by studying
the history books,

01:11:50.762 --> 01:11:54.598
we know exactly where General Washington's
troops were and how they moved

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.668
when this was written. But that's
not what Chef Edward wrote here.

01:11:58.670 --> 01:12:03.172
The information here, which was to be
passed on to a British soldier or spy,

01:12:03.174 --> 01:12:04.308
is false.

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:06.009
Well, this keeps getting
better and better.

01:12:06.011 --> 01:12:08.478
The people of Newport Cove
will be glad to know that

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.482
Chef Edward DuFlay wasn't
working for the British,

01:12:11.484 --> 01:12:14.650
<i>but for General Washington,
himself, who no doubt</i>

01:12:14.652 --> 01:12:19.389
<i>thought a respected chef would be the
perfect man to feed his enemy fake intel</i>

01:12:19.391 --> 01:12:20.791
to throw them off-balance.

01:12:20.793 --> 01:12:21.992
And that means

01:12:21.994 --> 01:12:25.095
Edward DuFlay was a patriot.

01:12:25.097 --> 01:12:27.296
And a hero.

01:12:27.298 --> 01:12:28.998
DuFlay is innocent?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.902
But the red cloaks,
the quadcopter,

01:12:31.904 --> 01:12:34.805
the electromagnet,
years of meticulous planning.

01:12:34.807 --> 01:12:36.605
It was all for nothing?

01:12:36.607 --> 01:12:37.940
I wouldn't say "nothing."

01:12:37.942 --> 01:12:40.176
The resort got a ton
of free publicity.

01:12:40.178 --> 01:12:42.177
And the food's been
out of this world.

01:12:42.179 --> 01:12:44.984
Like, pass the ribs, Scoob.

01:12:46.218 --> 01:12:47.853
Huh! Hmm?

01:12:50.521 --> 01:12:53.158
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

01:12:53.926 --> 01:12:55.061
Aah!

01:12:56.828 --> 01:12:58.528
Well, I guess this is it.

01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:01.131
Freddie, I can't thank
you and your friends enough

01:13:01.133 --> 01:13:03.800
for saving both the inn
and the family name.

01:13:03.802 --> 01:13:06.302
So long, Flay.

01:13:06.304 --> 01:13:10.907
Mr. Nosay-worthy... Sorry,
Noseworthy, is still leaving?

01:13:10.909 --> 01:13:13.277
Yeah, we tried to talk him
into staying,

01:13:13.279 --> 01:13:16.913
but since there's now a position
open at the Historical Society,

01:13:16.915 --> 01:13:18.681
he's giving that a go.

01:13:18.683 --> 01:13:21.551
He just might have
a "nosay" for it.

01:13:23.187 --> 01:13:25.755
We made you guys something.
In honor of Chef Edward,

01:13:25.757 --> 01:13:29.359
we packed you a picnic basket
full of to-go sandwiches.

01:13:29.361 --> 01:13:31.627
They're all wrapped
in parchment.

01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:32.862
Regular parchment.

01:13:32.864 --> 01:13:34.663
No hidden messages.

01:13:34.665 --> 01:13:37.802
Unless you count the stuff Chef
Sue spelled out in mustard.

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:43.973
Bye, everyone.

01:13:43.975 --> 01:13:46.344
- So long.
- Have a safe trip.

01:13:48.946 --> 01:13:50.579
Like, excuse me,

01:13:50.581 --> 01:13:53.049
but I'm still a little fuzzy
on one thing.

01:13:53.051 --> 01:13:54.417
What's that, Shaggy?

01:13:54.419 --> 01:13:56.752
If there was no such thing
as the Red Ghost,

01:13:56.754 --> 01:14:00.390
what was Chef Edward shouting
the night he disappeared?

01:14:00.392 --> 01:14:01.792
Yeah! What?

01:14:01.794 --> 01:14:03.725
I suspect he was found out.

01:14:03.727 --> 01:14:06.997
When the British discovered he was
feeding them false intelligence...

01:14:06.999 --> 01:14:08.998
They came to take him away.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.001
He wasn't shouting
"Red Ghost."

01:14:11.003 --> 01:14:12.702
He was shouting "Redcoats,"

01:14:12.704 --> 01:14:15.572
a popular term for English
soldiers back then.

01:14:15.574 --> 01:14:19.341
What's even more interesting is
that at the time, most people...

01:14:25.616 --> 01:14:27.650
Can you keep it down?

01:14:27.652 --> 01:14:30.354
I'm trying to get
some sleep here.

01:14:30.356 --> 01:14:33.189
Boy, that Skip Taylor
is really something.

01:14:33.191 --> 01:14:35.127
He really is.

01:14:35.928 --> 01:14:37.163
Yup.
