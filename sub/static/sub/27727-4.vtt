Now, coming up
in today's show...

01:36.280 --> 01:38.520
Thank you. Now...

01:38.560 --> 01:40.760
throughout
the developing world,

01:40.800 --> 01:42.280
people have, for many years,

01:42.320 --> 01:45.360
used Japanese-made
pick-up trucks.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.400
Yes, but now
European car makers

01:47.440 --> 01:49.440
have decided they want
a piece of the action.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.840
So they've come up with
pick-up trucks of their own.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.000
Yes, they have, and to
find out if they're any good,

01:54.040 --> 01:55.920
this week we take
The Grand Tour

01:55.960 --> 01:58.080
on a journey
through history.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.280
Mm, we begin
in the Middle Ages,

02:00.320 --> 02:03.280
which meant going to
Richard Hammond's garden.

(BABY CRYING)

02:25.160 --> 02:29.320
JEREMY: In parts of the globe
where there's no mains water
or electricity,

02:29.360 --> 02:31.720
a pick-up truck has to be
more than

02:31.760 --> 02:35.360
just transport for
plague victims and livestock.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.160
(WHIRRING)

02:37.240 --> 02:40.160
That's why James has turned
his Mercedes X-Class

02:40.160 --> 02:43.600
into a power station
using its rear axle

02:43.680 --> 02:46.680
to make electricity
for the village.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.960
Richard, meanwhile, was using
his Ford Ranger as a tractor,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.120
pulling a plough.

02:56.840 --> 03:00.280
Yep, I'm actually ploughing
with my pick-up.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.320
I don't think I could be
any happier.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.440
JEREMY: And I was using
this Volkswagen Amarok

03:09.480 --> 03:11.600
as an irrigation system.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.000
I'm using it to drive a pump,

03:15.040 --> 03:17.560
which will deliver
nourishment from the well

03:17.600 --> 03:19.400
to the community allotment.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.000
In fact... Yep, I can hear
the water coming now,

03:23.040 --> 03:27.480
above the smooth turbocharged
throb of my V6 diesel.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.360
Ah! Ooh!

03:39.720 --> 03:41.840

03:41.880 --> 03:43.600
Get it!

03:47.920 --> 03:49.240
-Hammond!
-What?

03:49.280 --> 03:51.400
We've gotta get...
How do you get that back?

03:51.440 --> 03:53.800
I don't know.
You set it free.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.280
-Whoa!
-Watch out!

03:55.320 --> 03:58.160
You've made it angry!
Run away!

03:59.280 --> 04:01.120

04:12.120 --> 04:13.720
Clarkson!

04:16.440 --> 04:18.000
Turn the car off!

04:22.000 --> 04:24.720
JAMES: What was that?
-I cut my...

04:24.760 --> 04:26.800
-Oh, dear.
-And there.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.800
And there.
And I've done my neck in.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.800
This is supposed to be
a demonstration

04:30.880 --> 04:32.720
of the utility
of pick-up trucks.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.640
We've done it. We've proved
all three of them...

04:34.680 --> 04:37.720
Yeah, no, I have.
I've sawn three pieces
of wood for a fence.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.240
Hammond's ploughed
four furrows
for growing things in.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.480
You have only subtracted
from this community.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.000
You've taken away
the vegetables.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.240
You've taken away
the electricity.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.000
You've taken away
the lighting.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.160
You've taken away the ability
to make the new fence posts.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.920
-I have proved...
-And you've taken
away the food.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.120
But my engine is very
powerful. More powerful
than in your two.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.040
Yeah,
but what's the use of that?

04:57.080 --> 04:58.920
-Speed and power.
-It's not speed and power.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.360
Yeah, well it is, look.
Look what it did!

05:00.440 --> 05:02.560
Look what it did.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.720
Yours couldn't have delivered
that much water that quickly.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.920
Yeah, thankfully, because it
wouldn't have done that.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.360
I think you've slightly
missed the point.

05:08.360 --> 05:13.200
Why... Why do you always
have to overdo everything?

05:13.240 --> 05:15.160
JEREMY: You can shut up.
-Why?

05:15.200 --> 05:18.160
Because it's supposed to be
a test of European
pick-up trucks.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.600
It's European.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.560
Well, yes,
apart from the fact

05:21.600 --> 05:24.720
that it was designed
in Australia and it's built
in South Africa.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.240
What about the engine?

05:26.320 --> 05:29.040
-That's made in Turkey.
-That's European.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.440
Well, a bit of it is.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.040
Let's not get bogged down
with where Turkey is.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.800
What we've done is proved
that all three of them

05:35.840 --> 05:38.040
work well when there is peace

05:38.080 --> 05:40.080
in the village
in the developing world.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.880
What we must do now is
find out how well they work

05:43.920 --> 05:47.040
when the peace comes to an
end and there's a revolution.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.320
JAMES: When the revolution
is over,

06:01.360 --> 06:07.320
it's important that all
traces of the vile, hated
dictator are eradicated.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.160
And that's why I'm
attaching my Mercedes

06:09.200 --> 06:12.320
to this giant statue
of Kim Jong Clarkson,

06:12.360 --> 06:14.000
to see if I can pull it over.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.040
(DRAMATIC SINGING IN LATIN)

06:21.000 --> 06:22.560
Right, here are the rules.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.800
I have to do this using
the lowest revs possible.

06:25.840 --> 06:30.040
So what I'm gonna do is
put it in four-wheel drive
low range -

06:30.080 --> 06:32.200
something Jeremy Clarkson
can't do -

06:32.240 --> 06:36.640
first gear manual and turn
the traction control off.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.280
You know that isn't really
a Mercedes, don't you?

06:39.320 --> 06:41.720
It's just a Nissan with
"Mercedes" written on it.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.840
JEREMY: It's got
a Nissan engine.
-Yeah.

06:43.880 --> 06:48.320
And that's his problem.
Cos it's only a 2.3,
four-cylinder diesel.

06:48.360 --> 06:52.160
Right. Taking up the slack.

and torque to do a job...

you go for.

-What a feeling.
-Oh, bet that... Did that...
That was just...

07:34.600 --> 07:36.800
-That is in the face.
-Yes.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.640
By the whole Earth.

to your nose? Look at it.
-Yes.

And now, it's your turn.
Because... (CLEARS THROAT)

07:44.360 --> 07:45.880
Yeah, May Tse-tung.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.840
Right, it's time for your
reign of terror to end.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.000
He may be the most stubborn
man in the world,

07:56.040 --> 08:00.080
but he's no match for the
engine in this Ford Ranger.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.760
I have, of course, more power
in this than in his Nissan -

08:03.800 --> 08:08.160
197 brake to his 188 -
and more torque.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.400
This engine is strong.
Strong enough
to pull a train, literally.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.920
Because they are
actually using

08:12.960 --> 08:14.480

out of this

in the new Vivarail 230

08:18.120 --> 08:22.200
You know he's got
one more cylinder than you?

08:22.240 --> 08:24.800
Yeah, that's cos that engine
came from a Turkish bazaar.

of modest statue.
-Yeah, fine.

compared to yours.

proportional to
the size of the tyranny.

low range.

I don't need it.

worked that out?

in the village.

Probably not now, but it was.

12:22.520 --> 12:26.360
I have the biggest engine -
3.2 litres, five cylinders,

12:26.400 --> 12:28.320
and not only is it strong
enough to pull a train,

12:28.360 --> 12:32.400
literally, it's also
the engine they use
in the Transit van.

12:32.440 --> 12:36.200
And those, as anyone
who's ever been
on a motorway knows,

12:36.240 --> 12:39.280
have a top speed
of more than what you're in.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.640
Now we're alone, viewers,
I will admit

12:42.680 --> 12:45.000
I'm not feeling entirely
confident about this.

12:45.040 --> 12:48.560
The 2.3 litre engine in
my Mercedes is very robust.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.640
It will last for
a thousand years.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.320
But it's not
what you'd call powerful.

12:52.360 --> 12:55.120
I think there might be a few
aerodynamic issues as well.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.160
But, anyway,
I'm gonna go in D

12:57.200 --> 12:59.800
on the basis that Mercedes
knows better than me.

Oh, I've lost my bike!

13:30.680 --> 13:33.280
I was so hoping to have my
bike available once I'd fled.

Bit of buffeting
and I'm losing.

-Oh, no, we've got a chair.
-You say that...

-We're gonna be all right.
-I literally think we're OK.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.760
-Yes.
-So, let's just get this
crystal clear.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.560
OK, we haven't
escaped with much,

14:53.600 --> 14:56.720
but the Volkswagen

-Me.

Yeah, but this isn't
a dictatorship any more.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.200
-We toppled the dictator.
-Yeah. It's a democracy.

15:02.240 --> 15:05.040
It was the fastest by a mile.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.640
Yeah, it is the fastest.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.800
It was easily the best
at pulling over statues

15:08.840 --> 15:11.120
and the best
at water irrigation.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.600
There's been a lot of talk
recently about electric cars,

16:32.640 --> 16:35.280
obviously, so we thought
we ought to have
some conversation about that.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.480
-Yeah.
-And we're gonna
kick it off, if I may,

16:37.520 --> 16:40.480
with the new Audi e-tron.
Got a picture of it here.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.400
Sure, it's very nice.

16:42.440 --> 16:46.640
The only problem is e-tron is
the French word... for turd.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.040
-(LAUGHTER)
-Is it?

16:48.080 --> 16:49.560
Mmm, yes.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.920
They're not gonna sell
many of those in France,
I'm guessing.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.760
No, they probably won't.
In the same way that Hyundai

16:54.800 --> 16:57.080
has just introduced
a new car called the Kona.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.240
They're not gonna be selling
too many of those
in Portugal.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.560
Why? Is "Kona"
Portuguese for "turd"?

-No.
-What, then?

we can't say.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.320
-Moving on.
-Yes.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.320
Have you seen
those stories around

17:16.400 --> 17:19.720
about Jaguar possibly
going over to making
only electric cars?

17:19.760 --> 17:22.760
-I have read that, yeah.
-All Jaguars would be
electric, which is a worry.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.000
Because, potentially, it'll
make it a lot more difficult

17:25.040 --> 17:27.240
to hear your
Jaguar-driving guest

in the boot.
-Good point.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.800
-Very good point.
-That's a risk.

"Oh, no,
I've just taken all..."

17:34.280 --> 17:35.800

over at mine."

-"Just pop that in the wall."
-"Yes, if you don't mind."

Yeah, no, but if we may
be serious for a moment,

17:48.080 --> 17:49.560
the biggest problem is

17:49.560 --> 17:52.880
the electrical charging
infrastructure
in this country

17:52.920 --> 17:55.560
simply isn't
good enough to...

17:55.640 --> 17:58.680
sustain a great deal
of demand. It just isn't.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.000
Yeah, but it'll get better
and the vast majority
of people

18:01.040 --> 18:02.440
simply recharge at night.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.320
-That's what I do, with mine.
-Yes, I know.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.080
But if you go on a long
journey, you can't take
your house.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.720
You've gotta charge up
somewhere else.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.160
Yes, but electric
charging points

18:10.200 --> 18:11.800
are springing up everywhere
at the moment

18:11.800 --> 18:12.960
-at quite a rate.
-I agree.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
-They are.
-They are. They are.

18:15.040 --> 18:19.320
But look at it this way.
OK, the second most boring
thing a man can do

18:19.400 --> 18:22.080
is filling up with petrol -
second most after...

18:22.160 --> 18:23.560
ALL: Trying on trousers.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.560
-We all agree
that's the worst.
-It's just a fact.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.160
The second most boring thing
you can do

18:27.200 --> 18:29.080
is fill up with petrol, which
takes what, three minutes?

18:29.160 --> 18:30.560
-Yes.
-Charging a car up

18:30.640 --> 18:34.200
is like 40 minutes, and I
haven't got time for that.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.080
No, but it's, it's...
40 minutes is getting...

18:36.080 --> 18:37.880
You can do it
in less than that now

18:37.920 --> 18:39.680
and it's getting shorter
and shorter all the time.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.480
Charging times are
plummeting. They're dropping.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.800
But you've gotta go
into a service station,
surrounded by people

18:43.800 --> 18:46.320
with smelly bottoms,
all playing on those
slot machines.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.040
And 40 minutes,
you just think,

18:48.080 --> 18:50.560
"I've got so much more I'd
rather be doing than this."

18:50.640 --> 18:52.800
I only have, if I'm lucky,

18:52.880 --> 18:56.760
175,000 hours
before I do dying.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.240

waste any of them

of it here. There it is.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.440
I've ridden it.
I've driven it as well,
actually, and it's excellent.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.160
Very, very smooth,
very comfortable,

19:12.200 --> 19:13.680
and obviously
it's very quiet.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.440
Which means you can hear
the driver's views

19:15.480 --> 19:16.920
on immigration more clearly.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.240
-(LAUGHTER)
-Everybody always says...

19:19.280 --> 19:21.520
I like black cabs.
I use them all the time.

Yeah, you really are
a dinosaur.

-No, I just hate Uber.
-You don't hate Uber.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.560
-I do hate Uber.
-They just work.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.080
Have you seen how they drive?

19:29.160 --> 19:31.920
They're appalling!
Dithering about in
the middle of junctions

19:31.960 --> 19:33.560
and they don't know
where they're going.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.400
And it's always a Prius.
And I hate those commercials

19:36.440 --> 19:39.520
where they say, "Not all of
our drivers are rapists."

19:39.560 --> 19:41.960
-(LAUGHTER)
-That's not really
a slogan, is it?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.320
I'm sorry, I just...
I will not get in with...

19:44.320 --> 19:49.000
And, listen, I've only got
175,000 hours left...

19:49.040 --> 19:50.680
If you...
If you don't stop saying

19:50.720 --> 19:53.880
how many hours you've got
left, I shall make it less.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.680
-Look, I...
-A lot less.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.520
Yeah, I'm with him.
And I like Uber.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.400
I like the fact
that you get the alert

19:59.440 --> 20:01.240
that tells you
who's coming to pick you up

20:01.280 --> 20:02.640
and what sort of car
he's driving.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.080
-Yeah, that's...
-What's the point?

20:04.080 --> 20:05.760
It's a Prius.
It's always a Prius.

20:05.800 --> 20:06.960
No, it isn't always a Prius.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.640
I've got a friend
and she had one come -

20:08.680 --> 20:10.320
this was just before
Christmas, as it happened.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.800
The driver was
from South America.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.800
And she got an alert
and it said,

20:13.800 --> 20:16.400
"Jesus is arriving soon
in a Honda Accord."

20:16.440 --> 20:19.000
-(LAUGHTER)
-Which is not what it says
in the New Testament.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.280
-No, it doesn't.
-It's not, is it? Who knew?

20:21.320 --> 20:23.480
Anyway,
there is a new version
of the Bugatti Chiron.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.880
We've got
a picture of it here.
It's called the Chiron Sport.

20:26.920 --> 20:31.640
But that does make me wonder,
what bit of the regular
Chiron wasn't sporty?

20:31.680 --> 20:33.320
No, it was
a sporty car, anyway.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.640
It was quite sporty,
I noticed that.
Is that more powerful?

20:35.680 --> 20:39.280
No, but it is
18 kilograms lighter

20:39.320 --> 20:42.440
because it has carbon fibre
windscreen wipers.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.560
-What? That's all?
-What were the old ones
made of?

20:45.560 --> 20:47.800
-Cast iron.
-(LAUGHTER)

20:47.800 --> 20:49.920
-So it's 18 kilograms
lighter?
-Mm-hm.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.520
-And how much is it?
-Uh...it's £2.3 million.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.560
-(AUDIENCE MEMBER WHISTLES)
-That's a lot, isn't it?

20:54.560 --> 20:57.040
Well, hold on.
The standard one's, what,
two million quid, isn't it?

20:57.080 --> 20:58.400
-I've just had a thought.
-What?

20:58.440 --> 21:00.040
If you're prone to
going through life

21:00.080 --> 21:01.480
with quite a heavy
briefcase...

21:01.520 --> 21:03.680
-Yes?
-If you bought
the ordinary Chiron,

21:03.720 --> 21:05.520
left your briefcase at home,

21:05.560 --> 21:08.080
you've automatically created
the Sport, haven't you?

21:08.080 --> 21:10.520
-Yeah.
-And saved yourself £300,000.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.800
-(LAUGHTER)
-That... That is good advice.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.400
Yeah. A lot of people here
will be taking that away
with them and using it.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.440
-That's consumer advice.
-Exactly. I like to do that.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.320
All part of the service.
We're here for you.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.000
Can I move it on? I have some
interesting conversation.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.920
-Oh, good.
-There is a man in Canada

21:24.960 --> 21:28.080
who has successfully lowered
his car insurance premium

21:28.160 --> 21:30.480
by declaring himself
to be a woman.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.560
Now, he hasn't had
the operation,

21:32.560 --> 21:35.960
he hasn't swapped his beef
torpedo for the silken purse.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.560
-(LAUGHTER)
-He has merely...

21:37.560 --> 21:40.680
-Thank you, Doctor.
-(LAUGHTER)

21:40.720 --> 21:42.000
He has merely
taken advantage...

21:42.040 --> 21:44.440
He just said "beef torpedo",
didn't he?

21:44.480 --> 21:48.400
...of a loophole in the law
that allows you
to change your gender.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.280
Torpedo? You actually claim
you've got a torpedo?

21:51.320 --> 21:53.200
-(LAUGHTER)
-Everybody calls it that.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.040
A Spearfish he rides into...

21:55.080 --> 21:57.400
Listen, listen.
There's a lot of this about.

21:57.440 --> 22:01.000
There was a chap the other
day sentenced to some
considerable jail time,

22:01.040 --> 22:03.960
and as he was sentenced,
he went, "Oh, I've just
remembered, I'm a woman.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.680
Can I go to a lady prison?
Preferably one of those like
you see on the internet."

22:07.720 --> 22:09.360
Yeah, and it worked.
It worked.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.800
They sent him
to a lady prison.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.880
Where, sure enough, he's
been quite badly behaved.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.640
Yeah, chaps, I wouldn't
advise trying it down your
local swimming baths,

22:15.680 --> 22:17.040
swaggering into
the changing rooms.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.640
(DEEP VOICE)
"Morning. Morning, ladies.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.680
I'm a lady as well,
just like you and you.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.840
I'll just hang up my suit
and my tie there

22:22.880 --> 22:24.440
and take a shower
with the rest...

22:24.480 --> 22:27.120
Oh, my Lord, my vagina's
gone all stiff. Look at that."

22:27.160 --> 22:28.680
-(LAUGHTER)
-"I do apologise."

22:28.720 --> 22:31.160
It's a tricky
and obviously sensitive area,

22:31.200 --> 22:34.280
but my advice is
if you want to lower
your car insurance premium,

22:34.320 --> 22:36.600
don't walk into this
minefield of whether or not

22:36.640 --> 22:38.320
you can declare yourself
to be a woman.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.560
Simply declare yourself
to be a vicar.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.240
That's a good idea, because
they do have cheap insurance,
don't they?

22:43.280 --> 22:44.800
They do have
very cheap car insurance.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.240
And if you're a vicar...
you can still wear a dress.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.880
-There you go.
-Yeah, so everybody wins.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.920
-Everybody wins.
-More consumer advice.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.720
Ooh, now, you know Morgan?

22:53.760 --> 22:56.960
-I do.
-OK, they've got
a serious problem.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.640
Because they make the frames
of their cars out of ash.

22:59.680 --> 23:03.760
Now, all the ash trees
in Britain have either died
or are dying.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.320
So Morgan is going to have
to import its ash from...

23:07.360 --> 23:09.120
-abroad.
-What?

23:09.160 --> 23:11.160
-Foreign wood.
-Foreign wood in a Morgan?

23:11.200 --> 23:14.520
I know! Can you imagine?
And it may be German.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.400
Oh, good God!
German wood in a Morgan!

23:16.440 --> 23:17.960
-No, that's not possible!
-Imagine having German wood.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.400
Can't be done.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.320
That's probably why, because
of this immense problem,

23:22.360 --> 23:24.240
they've decided
to branch out.

23:24.280 --> 23:27.400
-What are they doing?
-Well, they're gonna
start making bicycles.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.160
-Are they made of wood?
-Well, yes, we've got a
picture. They are, actually.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.640
The mud guard and the chain
guard are both made of wood.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.080
-Really?
-Yeah.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.320
Oh, they're really roaring
into the future, Morgan.

23:36.360 --> 23:38.320
What are they doing next?
Is it a dugout canoe?

23:38.360 --> 23:41.040
Well, it's interesting
you should say that.
It's not a dugout canoe.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.760
It is - and this is
a big surprise for Morgan -

23:43.800 --> 23:45.320
they're making
hair care products.

23:45.360 --> 23:46.640
-What?
-What?

23:46.680 --> 23:48.960
They absolutely are making
hair care products.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.160
Um...I've actually got
the blurb about it.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.800
Here, this is actually from
Morgan's website, yeah?

23:53.840 --> 23:55.520
-Well, as they call it.
-They have...

23:55.560 --> 23:57.360
They call it
the electric computer.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.320
I was gonna say.
They have a website?

23:59.360 --> 24:01.680
OK, this is describing
their new hair products,

24:01.720 --> 24:04.360
-quintessentially British.
-(JAMES SCOFFS)

24:04.400 --> 24:07.280
"The lotion was originally
created to enable a gentleman

24:07.320 --> 24:09.120
to hold not only
the racing line,

24:09.160 --> 24:11.080
-but also his hair style."
-Lovely.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.400
(LAUGHTER)

24:12.440 --> 24:14.920
"So Morgan's
most stylish owners..."

24:14.960 --> 24:18.280
There's no such thing
as a stylish Morgan owner.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.400
"...can once again take to
the roads with confidence

24:20.440 --> 24:23.840
that their dapper coiffeur
will hold throughout
the journey."

24:23.880 --> 24:25.320
(LAUGHTER)

24:25.360 --> 24:27.120
Can I ask something,
while we're on the subject?

24:27.160 --> 24:29.760
Why is it that everything
in the world has a name?

24:29.800 --> 24:32.640
Like cups, spectacles,
Jeremy Clarkson's cardigan.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.120
But anything you put in your
hair is just called product?

24:35.160 --> 24:38.080
I don't get that.
The barber says,
"Would you like product?"

24:38.120 --> 24:40.480
You think, "No,
cos it might be HP Sauce."

24:40.520 --> 24:42.160
-That's a product.
-It's a bit vague.

24:42.200 --> 24:44.560
They could Tarmac your hair.
"It's product."

24:44.600 --> 24:46.360
-Exactly.
-Molten aluminium
is a product.

24:46.400 --> 24:49.320
-It is.
-Swarfega is a product.

24:49.360 --> 24:52.080
I'm not sure that Morgan
actually understands

24:52.120 --> 24:54.680
its customers very well,
with this plan.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.800
What, you're saying that
the typical Morgan customer

24:56.840 --> 24:58.280
-wouldn't traditionally...
-Yeah, look at th...

24:58.320 --> 25:00.080
They're not hair care
product kind of people.

25:00.120 --> 25:03.320
Let's just work this out.
Hammond, you have a Morgan.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.360
And...

25:05.400 --> 25:07.400
-Um...
-Actually...

25:07.440 --> 25:09.360
-I'm... I'm...
-Actually,
on the subject of that...

25:09.400 --> 25:11.920
Just talk amongst yourselves.
No, seriously, James May,

25:11.960 --> 25:14.040
I want to check
something out with you.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.840
If I may.
Just hang on a minute.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.360
What are you doing?

25:18.400 --> 25:22.840
Well, thing is,
OK, you say... you say
that you don't wear...

25:22.880 --> 25:25.000
Oh, I'm uncomfortable with
whatever's happening now.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.320
You will be.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.120
I took this photograph
just last week.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.640
I put an arrow on it
to show what I'm on about.

25:30.680 --> 25:32.520
That's Richard Hammond
sporting... I'll zoom in.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.080
-Some grey hairs there, yeah.
-...a couple of grey hairs.

25:35.120 --> 25:37.960
JAMES: Ohh.
-Can you see those? Yes?

25:38.000 --> 25:39.800
Now, when I came to work
this morning...

25:39.840 --> 25:41.480
They're still there.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.640
My wife has cut my hair.
They are still there.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.440
They're not. James May?
They're not there.

25:45.480 --> 25:48.080
-I don't dye my hair!
-They're not there.

25:48.120 --> 25:50.080
Come in really close.
They're still there.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.600
JAMES: Let me arbitrate
independently.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.320
-They're not there!
-They're not there!

25:54.360 --> 25:57.920
-They are! I never...
-You've been using
Morgan product.

25:57.960 --> 26:01.200
I've never dyed my ha...
Oh, God!

26:01.240 --> 26:04.200
Would you like to stop doing
Conversation Street now?

26:04.240 --> 26:05.960
I'd so like to do a...

26:06.000 --> 26:09.160
If you want to feed me
into a giant blender,
I'd prefer that.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.440
Right, that is the end
of Conversation Street.

26:11.480 --> 26:14.680
And now, if I may, I'd like
to talk about the Jaguar XE.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.560
Not your hair.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.120
Um...it is a really very nice
little car, if I'm honest.

26:20.160 --> 26:23.360
It's very good looking.
It's not particularly
expensive.

26:23.400 --> 26:26.760
Uh...it rides beautifully -
very beautifully, in fact.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.280
And, as a result of all that,

26:28.320 --> 26:31.480
people ignore it
and buy a BMW instead.

26:31.520 --> 26:34.320
So Jaguar went
to its skunkworks,

26:34.360 --> 26:35.920
which is based in a shed,

26:35.960 --> 26:38.280
and they said, "Could
you make a fast version?

26:38.320 --> 26:40.920
One that will get
everybody talking."

(THUNDER RUMBLES)

26:49.960 --> 26:52.280
JEREMY: The standard
low cost procedure

26:52.320 --> 26:55.640
for turning a normal saloon
into a sports saloon

26:55.680 --> 27:01.280
is to give it some fat tyres,
a nice V6 engine...

27:01.320 --> 27:02.680
(ENGINE ROARING)

27:02.720 --> 27:04.880
...and maybe
some bucket seats.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.640
But the boffins at Jag
decided to go...

27:10.680 --> 27:12.400
...a bit further than that.

27:13.720 --> 27:16.240
(ENGINE ROARING)

27:23.080 --> 27:25.440
Welcome, everyone,
to what's called...

27:26.640 --> 27:28.800
...the Project 8.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.360
The first thing
you need to know

27:42.400 --> 27:46.200
is that the only bits that
these two cars have in common

27:46.240 --> 27:49.040
are the roof
and the front doors.

27:50.120 --> 27:52.760
Everything else is changed.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.960
For some very good reasons.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.480
First of all,
they decided they needed
carbon ceramic brakes

28:00.520 --> 28:03.600
that were much bigger
than the brakes
on the standard car.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.240
Now, that meant they needed

28:05.280 --> 28:07.680
bigger wheels
to go round the brakes.

28:07.720 --> 28:11.720
And bigger wheels
wouldn't fit in these arches.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.880
So they had to redesign
the whole front of the car.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.120
The headlamps, everything.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.240
Then there was the track -

28:21.280 --> 28:23.720
the gap between the wheels,
front and back.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.720
They decided
they'd like that to be wider.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.760
That meant
fitting flared wheel arches.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.400
So that meant a new panel
here... and here,

28:31.440 --> 28:33.280
and a new back door,

28:33.320 --> 28:36.080
and a new panel
here and here.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.040
Then came the engine.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.720
They decided they didn't
want to mess about

28:44.760 --> 28:48.600
and that they'd use
a five-litre supercharged V8.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.160
But that wouldn't fit.

28:50.200 --> 28:53.400
So, to get it in, they had to
cut away at the bulkhead.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.120
And when it was in place,
they thought,

28:55.160 --> 28:57.600
"Wait a minute.
That's all a bit heavy.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.000
We need to save some weight
at the front of the car."

29:00.040 --> 29:03.040
So, the bonnet, as you can
see here, is carbon fibre.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.000
And so are the front wings.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.040
And so is all this.

29:10.720 --> 29:13.120
(ENGINE ROARING)

29:14.720 --> 29:17.400
Suspension? Oh, yes,
that was changed as well.

29:17.440 --> 29:21.960
It now has Bilstein dampers
that cost £1,000 each.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.320
And rose joints.
And ceramic wheel bearings.

29:27.360 --> 29:30.200
-Like you get on a race car.
-(ENGINE GROWLS)

29:32.600 --> 29:37.400
On top of all that,
the eight-speed gearbox
also needed beefing up.

29:37.440 --> 29:40.120
And so did
the four-wheel drive system.

29:40.160 --> 29:43.320
And then they had to
get rid of the spare wheel

29:43.360 --> 29:45.600
and the well in which it sits

29:45.640 --> 29:49.800
to fit some under-floor
aerodynamics.

29:49.840 --> 29:53.760
And when they added up the
cost of all the work they'd
done, there was a problem.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.680
In order to make
any money at all,

29:56.720 --> 30:03.160
the Project 8
would have to cost £150,000.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.720
That's four times more
than the standard car.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.320
Four!

30:13.080 --> 30:15.360
So, here's the question.

30:15.400 --> 30:21.600
How mad would you have to be
to spend £150,000...

30:21.640 --> 30:26.080
...on a car that was designed
and built in a glorified shed

30:26.120 --> 30:29.080
in the Midlands...
in about 18 months?

30:31.760 --> 30:34.400
And the simple answer is...

30:34.440 --> 30:37.440
...not mad at all,
because this car...

30:37.480 --> 30:40.480
is fan-bleeding-tastic!

30:45.880 --> 30:48.000
The engine may be
ten years old,

30:48.040 --> 30:51.120
but it has
a huge amount of character.

30:53.040 --> 30:56.520
And nigh on 600 horsepower!

30:56.560 --> 30:57.800
(ENGINE ROARING)

30:57.840 --> 31:01.640
That means 0 to 60
in 3.3 seconds...

31:03.560 --> 31:06.040
...and a top speed of 200.

31:08.520 --> 31:10.360
Even more impressive,

31:10.400 --> 31:15.320
ten minutes before
the Nurburgring shut
its doors for the winter...

31:16.360 --> 31:18.280
...Jag's Project 8 engineers

31:18.320 --> 31:22.240
asked if they could have
one last go round it...

31:22.280 --> 31:26.160
and they shattered the record
for four-door saloons

31:26.200 --> 31:30.800
with a time of seven minutes,
21 seconds.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.360
That's blisteringly quick.

31:41.320 --> 31:45.760
I will say that if you've got
the car manually hunkered
down and it's in track mode,

31:45.800 --> 31:49.120
and the traction control
is turned off,

31:49.160 --> 31:52.680
things can go a bit violent
and bitey...

31:53.720 --> 31:56.800
...if you go
beyond the limit.

32:06.520 --> 32:09.000
(TYRES SCREECHING)

to stay within the limits

that's no hardship.

the four-wheel drive system

32:21.240 --> 32:24.960
and the wider track
and the Michelin Cup tyres

absolutely wobbles your eyes.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.520

You can corner at speeds

32:34.600 --> 32:37.800

can't quite believe.

through there.

-(TYRES SCREECHING)

33:03.640 --> 33:09.080
I am a sucker for small,
front-engined sports saloons.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.880
I had a Mercedes CLK Black.

33:12.920 --> 33:15.720
And this is better than that.

33:15.760 --> 33:19.920
This is better than
even the hottest BMW M3.

33:22.280 --> 33:25.080
You can whisper this,
but I reckon it's even better

33:25.120 --> 33:27.480
than Alfa's Quadrifoglio.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.360
This is very good.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.280
Really, really good.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.520
But... is it a Jag?

33:49.760 --> 33:52.440
Well, you can have it
with scaffolding in the back,

33:52.480 --> 33:55.560
but this one has
two proper seats.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.160
And in here,
it has enough space

33:58.200 --> 34:00.560
for a "borrowed" oil painting

34:00.600 --> 34:05.280
and all the kit that you need
to go out at night...

34:05.320 --> 34:06.880
and "borrow" another one.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.720
So, yes, it is a Jag.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.680
It even says
"prototype vehicle" on it,

34:11.720 --> 34:13.560
which means you don't
have to pay any tax.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.800
Like my prototype watch
and trousers.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.000
And this prototype camera
we're using today.

34:19.800 --> 34:23.160
And there's more.

34:23.160 --> 34:28.360
At normal road speeds
with the car in Comfort
or even Dynamic mode,

34:28.400 --> 34:33.480
it's as quiet and as
civilised as a Jag should be.

34:33.520 --> 34:37.440
It even has
little springs sitting
on top of the bigger springs

34:37.480 --> 34:40.360
to give you
a more comfortable ride.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.280
But everything's relative,
really.

34:42.320 --> 34:44.640
I mean,
it's not as comfortable, say,

34:44.680 --> 34:49.160
as lying in a hammock
on a summer's day,
listening to wood pigeons.

34:49.200 --> 34:52.040
But it does have
air conditioning

34:52.080 --> 34:53.880
and a head-up display
and electric seats,

34:53.920 --> 34:58.000
so it is more comfortable
than you'd expect.

35:01.520 --> 35:05.640
In fact, it's better than
you'd expect in every way.

35:07.080 --> 35:09.400
And maybe we shouldn't be
surprised by that,

35:09.440 --> 35:12.480
because the last time
something was designed
and built quickly,

35:12.520 --> 35:15.640
in a glorified shed,
in the Midlands,

35:15.680 --> 35:18.160
it was called the Spitfire.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.880
And it won
the Battle of Britain.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.920
(ENGINE ROARING)

35:28.120 --> 35:30.600
-(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)
-The Battle of Britain...

35:30.640 --> 35:35.840
And three, two, one,
cue James May.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.560
-Ready?
-Hang on. Hang on,
hang on, hang on, hang on.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.200
-Hang on. The Spitfire?
-Yes.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.640
It was the Hurricane that
won the Battle of Britain.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.520
-Well, it just wasn't.
-No, it just was.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.920
There were far more of them,
it was easier to build,

35:47.960 --> 35:50.280
it was easier to repair,
it was easier to fly.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.800
-It was.
-But that's like saying
that a Nissan Juke

35:52.840 --> 35:54.640
is better than
a Lamborghini Aventador

35:54.680 --> 35:57.120
because it's easier to build
and there are more of them.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.520
-No, it's not like that.
-It is.

35:58.560 --> 35:59.840
The Hurricane was
a much more stable

35:59.880 --> 36:01.440
gun platform
in the hands of a novice.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.440
The Hurricane accounted
for more enemy aircraft

36:03.480 --> 36:05.840
than all of our other
air defences combined.

36:05.880 --> 36:06.840
It won.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.360
Yes, but the Spitfire, OK,

36:08.400 --> 36:10.320
the Spitfire
looked glamorous.

36:10.360 --> 36:13.560
So you'd look up in the sky
and then that improved
morale on the ground,

36:13.600 --> 36:16.280
cos people were going,
"Wow, look at that!
We can't possibly lose this."

36:16.320 --> 36:18.600
Yes, but morale didn't
shoot down enemy aircraft.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.120
Hurricanes did.
That's simply a fact.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.080
But if a small boy's
looking out the window,

36:22.120 --> 36:24.360
"Wow! Look,
there's a Spitfire up there

36:24.400 --> 36:27.040
and I'm gonna join the RAF!"
And that's what we needed.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.800
He didn't wanna fly
a Hurricane cos it looked
like a sad Basset Hound.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.640
No, it didn't.
And anyway, the best...

36:31.640 --> 36:33.480
The best fighter aircraft
of World War II

36:33.520 --> 36:35.280
was the Messerschmitt 109.
Everybody knows that.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.160
-That didn't win
the Battle of Britain!
-Well, it...

36:37.160 --> 36:39.760
To be honest, nobody won
the Battle of Britain.
It was a draw.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.400
What? Where have you
got that from?

36:41.440 --> 36:45.080
-It was a draw.
-Chaps! Chaps! Chaps!

36:45.120 --> 36:48.080
Hate to make this whole thing
sound like, I don't know...

36:48.120 --> 36:51.640
a car show, but can we
get it back to the Jag
a bit, please?

36:51.640 --> 36:53.880
Yes. I don't want to talk
to him about aeroplanes.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.440
-Cos he's wrong.
-OK, OK. Remember the Jag.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.280
-Yes.
-Is it a mainstream car?

36:58.320 --> 37:00.360
No. No, if I'm honest,
it isn't.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.760
They've only made 300 of them

37:01.800 --> 37:03.280
and they're all
left-hand drive.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.640
So they went to all that time
and trouble to develop it...

37:05.640 --> 37:07.600
-And expense.
-...and now they're
only building a handful

37:07.640 --> 37:09.640
and they've put the steering
wheel on the wrong side?

37:09.680 --> 37:12.920
No, it is... it is very odd,
but since I don't want to
listen to him

37:12.960 --> 37:14.840
talking about Hurricanes
any more, I do think

37:14.880 --> 37:18.400
we should find out how fast
it goes round the Eboladrome.

37:20.680 --> 37:23.440
in a cloud of

37:23.480 --> 37:25.880
and immediately
onto the Isn't Straight.

37:27.440 --> 37:28.920
Twitchy with
a change of line,

37:28.960 --> 37:30.680

down the eight-speed box.

More tyre squeal from
those super-sticky Michelins.

37:50.760 --> 37:53.560
And clearly they are
working well.

Right, back on the power now
for the full-chat sprint.

37:56.360 --> 37:58.000

OK, more hard braking soon...

the tricky complex
at Old Lady's House.

it drives on the road.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.320

where it goes.

38:43.360 --> 38:45.960
Or does it indeed get
onto that list at all?

Let's move it up.

And relax.

And carry on.

Tonight, we are
finding out... Is this right?

39:09.960 --> 39:13.160
Tonight... we are finding out

39:13.200 --> 39:15.640
how the new breed
of European pick-up trucks

39:15.680 --> 39:17.920
would fare
in the developing world.

39:17.960 --> 39:21.640
And we've learned
that the Volkswagen
is the best of the lot.

39:21.680 --> 39:24.200
-No, we didn't learn that.
-Well, we did.

39:24.280 --> 39:26.400
It was the fastest
and it was the most powerful.

39:26.440 --> 39:28.640
Yeah, but that's not actually
terribly relevant

where there are more AK-47s
than ambulances, is it?

Yes, but whatever. OK?

happens when the peace ends

and the dictator is toppled
and chaos ensues.

after that.

40:00.480 --> 40:05.280
to get this fuel...
to the nation's helicopter.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.520
And then the villagers
can be strafed.

40:08.680 --> 40:10.760
-Really?
-That's what happens.

40:10.800 --> 40:14.560

we have got to go from here

40:14.600 --> 40:16.680
to this forward
operating base.

And the first one there
is the winner.

it is rather pertinent
that we are filming this
in the UK,

because in a couple of years

41:04.120 --> 41:06.520
when Brexit has really
caught up with us,

41:06.560 --> 41:08.080
there will be a civil war

41:08.120 --> 41:11.920
and you will need
pick-up trucks to survive.

this gap in the wall,

43:47.640 --> 43:49.200
Which way do I go?

43:50.840 --> 43:54.280
Uh...maybe if I drove round
faster I could work it out.

43:54.320 --> 43:56.720
(ENGINE ROARING)

44:00.080 --> 44:02.240
Yeah, it's this way.
Here we go.

44:02.280 --> 44:04.600
All cleared up now.

44:07.040 --> 44:09.760
JAMES: Meanwhile,
in the Mercedes,

44:09.800 --> 44:12.400
I was making
excellent progress.

44:12.440 --> 44:15.600
I've got this fantastic
360-degree camera
system in here,

44:15.640 --> 44:17.400
so when I'm doing
a tricky bit like this,

44:17.440 --> 44:19.640
I can turn the knob
and look down each side.

44:19.680 --> 44:22.480
I can look down the right
wheel, down the left wheel,
down the front.

44:25.720 --> 44:28.400
Absolutely no excuse
for hitting anything. Easy.

44:28.440 --> 44:31.640
I haven't grounded out
once doing this.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.320
(THUDDING)

44:36.560 --> 44:38.280
Um...

44:38.320 --> 44:41.320
Meanwhile, I'd just realised
that for once in his life,

44:41.360 --> 44:44.480
James had actually been going
in the right direction.

44:44.520 --> 44:46.760
OK, I am lost.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.840
I think it was that way.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.680
I'm gonna go this way.

44:50.720 --> 44:52.440
Right,
let's see what you got.

44:52.480 --> 44:56.120
Come on.
I cannot lose this race.

-(THUDDING AND CLUNKING)
-Ooh!

45:05.000 --> 45:07.160
Careful. A bit of a bump.

45:08.760 --> 45:11.160
JAMES: With the others
far behind,

45:11.200 --> 45:15.000
I'd found a rough track
that led to the forward
operating base.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.040
Buffeting...

45:21.080 --> 45:23.400
Ohh, that's a big hole. Argh.

45:26.440 --> 45:30.600
RICHARD: And Jeremy and I
were also heading
in the right direction,

45:30.640 --> 45:33.560
on a route that was longer,
but faster.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.800

45:51.120 --> 45:53.480
Yes!

45:53.520 --> 45:56.880
On the fast track, the Amarok
was starting to come good.

45:58.960 --> 46:01.320
This is quick. Very quick.

46:02.800 --> 46:06.800
Even with 100 gallons
of Avgas in the back.

46:09.280 --> 46:11.960
Whoa, hang on!

46:12.000 --> 46:15.840
JAMES: Even though
the Merc was the only one
with coil springs,

46:15.880 --> 46:18.520
life on the rough track
was very uncomfortable.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.160
-(THUDDING)
-Aargh!

46:21.480 --> 46:23.360
Bogs!

Whoa!

46:25.800 --> 46:27.760
And then...

46:29.160 --> 46:30.680
Bollocks!

46:32.880 --> 46:35.360
That is a complete dead end.

46:35.400 --> 46:37.600
I've wasted my time.
I'm gonna have to go back.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.960
I can't turn round there.
Oh, God.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.960
Or there.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.360
This is losing me vital time.

46:52.520 --> 46:54.080
JEREMY: On the faster route,

46:54.120 --> 46:57.600
the powerful Amarok was
starting to rein in the Ford.

46:59.080 --> 47:01.240
Right, Hammond,
I'm coming to get you!

47:02.920 --> 47:05.800

No way!

he won this one as well.

at a time of strife
in your country,

49:19.680 --> 49:22.120

the winner at everything.

prevented the war?

-Well, because...
-The helicopter
was there to stop the war

49:27.720 --> 49:29.440
by strafing
the uprising villagers.

-And now it can't do that.
-No.

you turn on the news

and there's somebody standing
in the back of a Toyota
or a Nissan,

shooting at someone
in a Humvee or a Land Rover.

is how good will our

which one is best.

These included
some big barn doors,

and a selection
of cardboard soldiers.

to go first,

a bit of a problem.

Why haven't you set off?

this small repair.

50:44.120 --> 50:45.680
What are you repairing?

50:45.720 --> 50:47.280
Well, when the barrels
were in,

50:47.320 --> 50:49.920
it slightly
bowed out the sides,

50:49.960 --> 50:53.320
and as a result of that,
this won't stay shut...

50:53.360 --> 50:55.160

but you go over a bump

50:56.720 --> 50:58.760
and that latch...
See how that doesn't line up?

50:58.800 --> 51:00.760

pick-up by using it
as a pick-up?

51:00.800 --> 51:02.960
No, I'm sorry, I...
There's more to it than that.

-He shoots
from his left side.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.360
Exactly. He's diagonal.

Which means all the spent
cartridges burn his arm.

55:48.760 --> 55:52.240
I may be...
I'm getting a bit...
It's the leaf springs.

55:52.280 --> 55:55.240
Bad mark for Volkswagen
there, this jigglyness.

55:55.280 --> 55:57.560
Right, here we go. Men.

55:57.600 --> 55:59.560
Die!

56:02.000 --> 56:03.760
Die!

56:03.800 --> 56:07.240
-(EXPLOSION)
-Oh, God.

56:07.280 --> 56:10.000
After this,
I got a bit carried away.

(BELL DINGS)

56:23.280 --> 56:24.640
Up! Oh, God.

56:24.680 --> 56:27.360
I'm gonna be in trouble
for that one.

56:27.400 --> 56:30.240
I've done that
very wrong there, look.

56:30.280 --> 56:34.160
I've just noticed something.
It's got sights!

56:34.200 --> 56:36.440
It's not just guesswork.
That's useful.

56:37.560 --> 56:40.760
Right, barn door.
Here we go.

57:12.960 --> 57:14.360
-What?
-Another victory!

57:14.400 --> 57:16.000
How do you work that out?

57:16.040 --> 57:17.600
I hate to tell you this,

57:17.640 --> 57:19.120
but you haven't hit the doors,
which was the target.

57:19.160 --> 57:20.920
How do you know
I haven't hit the doors?

57:20.960 --> 57:23.360
-Because there's no...
-(CLATTERING)

57:28.520 --> 57:31.440
Well, on that terrible
disappointment for him...

57:33.640 --> 57:35.640
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

57:37.200 --> 57:38.960
No! No, no, no!

Don't... Don't clap!
Don't clap!

57:42.280 --> 57:43.760
He killed a man!

57:43.800 --> 57:46.240
-(LAUGHTER)
-You jammed an AK-47!

57:46.280 --> 57:48.160
-Well...
-It's famously un-jammable!

57:48.200 --> 57:51.000
No one in history
has ever jammed one
till you came along!

57:51.040 --> 57:52.600
Yes, it overheated!

57:52.640 --> 57:55.000
That's cos you were
firing it into the air

57:55.040 --> 57:57.120
pointlessly
when you set off!

57:57.160 --> 57:58.600
That's what they're for!

57:58.640 --> 58:00.800
Weddings, funerals,
exam results -

58:00.840 --> 58:03.000
you go outside,
fire your AK in the air!

58:03.040 --> 58:04.640
It's a joyous thing!

58:04.680 --> 58:07.200
They are the party popper
of the developing world!

58:07.240 --> 58:08.680
(LAUGHTER)

58:09.920 --> 58:11.880
Never mind all that.

58:11.920 --> 58:14.360
-I have the scores.
The final scores.
-This is the important bit.

58:14.400 --> 58:18.040
Jeremy Clarkson,
you fired 2,600 rounds.

58:18.080 --> 58:19.320
Mm-hm.

58:19.360 --> 58:22.760
And the number of targets
you hit...was one.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.400
(LAUGHTER)

58:24.440 --> 58:26.920
You laugh,
but it's one more than him!

58:26.960 --> 58:29.440
-Uh...it is.
-It is one more than you,
so I'm winning!

58:29.480 --> 58:32.520
Wait, so hang on,
it all boils down to
how many targets I hit.

58:32.560 --> 58:34.960
-Yes, but you had
a roll bar to hang onto.
-I did.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.680
Yeah, he did.
And he scored...

58:36.720 --> 58:38.040
Yes?

58:38.080 --> 58:39.320
..nought.

58:39.360 --> 58:41.040
-(LAUGHTER)
-He really got nothing?

58:41.080 --> 58:43.120
-Yep.
-OK, so after all of that,

58:43.160 --> 58:45.080
what is our conclusion,
gentlemen?

58:45.120 --> 58:46.960
-Can we do a sensible one?
-Yeah.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.080
See, the thing is, that
Mercedes Nissan you had,

58:49.120 --> 58:50.760
it did have
a wobbly back end,

58:50.800 --> 58:52.640
and I just don't think
that's good enough, actually,

58:52.680 --> 58:54.240
in a pick-up truck,
I really don't.

58:54.280 --> 58:56.360
The Volkswagen is very good,

58:56.400 --> 58:59.920
but pick-up trucks
are working tools,
and it's just a bit too posh.

58:59.960 --> 59:03.160
You wouldn't want to
get into it in muddy boots.
I don't think that will work.

59:03.200 --> 59:05.000
So, it's the Ford, then?
It's the cheapest.

59:05.040 --> 59:07.400
It is the cheapest. And it's,
I think, the best-looking.

59:07.440 --> 59:09.280
And it is actually
the one I'd have.

59:09.320 --> 59:10.920
-You'd have the Ford?
-Yeah.

59:10.960 --> 59:12.640
-And you'd have the Ford?
-We'd both have the Ford.

59:12.680 --> 59:14.240
James, what would you have?

59:14.280 --> 59:16.200
I wouldn't have
a pick-up truck.

59:16.240 --> 59:18.520
-(LAUGHTER)
-Yes, I know,
but in this test

59:18.560 --> 59:20.280
of pick-up trucks,
which one would you have?

59:20.320 --> 59:22.080
None of them.
I wouldn't have one.

59:22.120 --> 59:24.000
Yeah, I know!
But we're testing pick-ups,

59:24.040 --> 59:26.560
so which pick-up truck of
the three would you have?

59:26.600 --> 59:28.920
I wouldn't have
a pick-up truck.

59:28.960 --> 59:31.240
You've just spent 20 minutes
reviewing these
pick-up trucks.

59:31.280 --> 59:34.280
The ladies and gentlemen
would like to know
which is the best?

59:34.320 --> 59:36.720
I've come to a conclusion,
on behalf of the ladies
and gentlemen,

59:36.760 --> 59:38.560
which is
don't have a pick-up truck.

59:38.600 --> 59:41.200
James! You have
a powerful imagination!

59:41.240 --> 59:43.040
Use it! Let's pretend!

59:43.080 --> 59:44.560
OK, come with me
on a journey.

59:44.600 --> 59:46.720
We'll warm
your imagination up.

59:46.760 --> 59:49.680
-Imagine you're an eagle.
-OK.

59:49.720 --> 59:51.840
Visualise that you're
flying over mountains.

59:51.880 --> 59:54.280
Can you feel it? Can you feel
the wind in your feathers?

59:54.320 --> 59:55.880
-Mmm.
-It's beautiful, isn't it?

59:55.920 --> 59:59.120
-Yeah.
-OK, now imagine
you've got a pick-up truck.

59:59.160 --> 1:00:01.480
-Which one is it?
-Why would an eagle
have a pick-up truck?

1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:03.600
-(LAUGHTER)
-No! No!

1:00:03.640 --> 1:00:05.520
I mean, imagine...
OK, let's try...

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:09.600
OK, imagine, James May,
a pastoral scene.
Have you got it?

1:00:09.640 --> 1:00:12.040
There's, like,
rolling, grassy hills,

1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:13.720
a few sheep around -
you're a farmer.

1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:15.160
You're walking round
with your dog

1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:17.040
at your heel there,
sheep all around you.

1:00:17.080 --> 1:00:18.400
Can I have Beethoven playing?

1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:20.760
Beethoven is playing,
obviously, live.

1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:23.720
There's an old
five-bar gate there.

1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:25.920
An old oak tree
arches over the gate.

1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:28.520
And under the oak tree is
your farmer's pick-up truck.

1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:31.280
-Which one is it?
-It's not there.

1:00:31.320 --> 1:00:33.760
I wouldn't have it,
because I wouldn't have
a pick-up truck.

1:00:33.800 --> 1:00:35.800
Neither should anybody else.
You shouldn't have one.

1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:37.320
Even in your imagination...

1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:39.600
My imagination does not
admit a pick-up truck.

1:00:39.640 --> 1:00:41.800
-I'm not being stubborn.
I know my mind.
-Yes.

1:00:41.840 --> 1:00:43.640
And I don't want
a pick-up truck.

1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:47.240
What I know is that
you've wasted so much time

1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:48.840
not choosing a pick-up truck,

1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:51.200
and claiming that the Battle
of Britain was a draw,

1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:54.440
that we don't have time
for the big celebrity duel

1:00:54.480 --> 1:00:58.520
between...Adrian Chiles and
Howard from the Halifax ads.

1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:00.960
-Oh, no!
-Exactly!

1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.560
And on that terrible
disappointment, we must end.

1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:05.680
Thank you so much
for watching. Good night!

1:01:05.720 --> 1:01:07.720
