00:10.520 --> 00:17.360
So, there are these two young fish
swimming. They meet this older fish, coming the other way.

00:17.400 --> 00:22.400
"Good morning boys" the older fish said.
"Water is cold today, isn't it?"

00:22.440 --> 00:23.560
And then he swims off.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.360
The two younger fish
watch the older fish swim off

00:32.400 --> 00:39.360
and then they turn to each other, completely baffled,
and they go, "What the fuck is water?"

00:41.520 --> 00:46.480
David Foster Wallace told this story once.
See our water is called finances.

00:46.520 --> 00:52.360
You can't see it, You can't smell it,
and to most people is imperceptible.

00:52.400 --> 00:56.560
But we... we are the fish in the know.

00:57.320 --> 01:01.480
And it gives us a big advantage.
And a great responsibility.

01:01.520 --> 01:06.360
Yes it does. Don't ever forget that.
But if we are we the fish in the know...

01:06.400 --> 01:11.520
Then Massimo, he's the one who
swims behind you and you don't even see him coming.

01:11.560 --> 01:16.480
He's the shark. You see, not one of us fish
thought to short Greece.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.520
Not one, except Massimo Ruggero.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.560
Keep shorting it.
Ten million to 118.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.560
No.
Another ten on 116.

01:29.600 --> 01:35.520
Not yet, Paul. We're looking 9 hundred million.
Ok listen everyone from now we keep shorting it. Ok?

01:42.640 --> 01:45.520
It's down six points,
but it's hitting bottom.

01:45.560 --> 01:46.600
No time to use it.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.720
Cover.
Ok, start cover our last shot position please.

01:58.720 --> 01:59.720
Cover. Start cover.

02:08.759 --> 02:11.880
I don't fucking believe it. A few seconds ago,
we were 900 million out.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.440
Now we're in the fucking clear.
Now we're in profit.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.400
Badass. Very badass.

02:16.640 --> 02:24.600
At the close Massimo generated profit f
or this bank in excess of 250 million dollars.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.520
To Massimo Ruggero!

02:26.560 --> 02:32.520
The fastest and deadliest shark
in the sea. And thank God he's our shark.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.520
Help!

02:54.640 --> 02:58.640
They say the devil's
greatest trick...

02:58.680 --> 03:01.640
is making us think he doesn't exist.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.640
But he is real.

03:09.720 --> 03:13.520
As real as the water
a fish swim in.

03:14.640 --> 03:18.560
As real as the finance
flowing through his bank.

03:21.720 --> 03:25.640
I drank his wine,
laughed at his jokes.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.600
I've looked into his eyes,

03:31.640 --> 03:36.720
and seen the terrifying
blackness of my own soul, reflected in his.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.600
Let's get to work. Let's not lose money.

03:49.640 --> 03:55.600
By September 15th, 2008,
Lehman Brothers had become a real estate hedge fund

03:55.640 --> 03:58.680
disguised as the American's fourth largest bank.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.720
They had over 600 trillion dollars in assets,

04:02.000 --> 04:06.680
and when they filed for bankruptcy,
the other banks became insolvent over night.

04:06.720 --> 04:10.520
They were not allowed to fail, of course.

04:10.560 --> 04:15.640
Instead, business for NYL and the other big
banks were soon better than ever.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.720
Are you ready, Maestro?
Oh you go ahead, I'll be along in a minute.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.600
You're coming, aren't you?
Even sharks go kick back once in a while.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.640
I am coming guys. I promise.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.520
I want to get a DB9.

04:51.520 --> 04:52.520
Goodnight.

05:01.720 --> 05:06.600
How about a drink?
John's memorial service is Monday, I should get home to Nina.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.600
Can I have a word? Yes.

05:09.640 --> 05:14.680
You know how proud I
am of you. How hard you work. How much you sacrifice.

05:14.720 --> 05:20.520
You deserve your success.
No one deserves this kind of success.

05:21.560 --> 05:25.680
You don't care about the money, do you?.
I think that part of you actually hates it.

05:25.720 --> 05:29.640
If it's about the promotion...
I'm supporting you.

05:29.680 --> 05:33.560
And I have every expectation you'll get it.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.600
But there is a problem.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.680
Edward Stuart.
Ed doesn't like you.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.720
He says he's not gonna report you after vice-CEO

05:43.520 --> 05:45.720
Just because I didn't grow up
drinking tea and playing cricket.

05:45.760 --> 05:51.600
Yeah he maybe is someway a racist but he's qualified.
And he has supporters on the board.

05:51.640 --> 05:55.600
You're asking if I'd report to Ed
if he gets vice-CEO instead of me.

05:55.640 --> 05:59.720
Other banks would snap you up in a minute.
I don't wanna lose you.

06:00.520 --> 06:04.600
I'm loyal, Dominic, you know that.
But you haven't answered the question.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.720
Massimo, how did you know to short Greece?

06:14.560 --> 06:18.640
And don't tell me you read the reports
because everybody else read them too.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.680
Instinct.

06:43.760 --> 06:51.680
These pictures are live and the tear gas clouds a
re just coming up to the balcony where we have our position.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.520
What's your name?
Don't have one.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.640
Where did Paul go
He's out there.

07:07.680 --> 07:12.640
Will ever get bored of chatting with every pretty thing?
No. Don't think he will.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.680
His martini is gonna get warm.
Then I'll drink it for him.

07:17.720 --> 07:21.720
So, to the best team on this
and every other trading floor.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.560
To you guys.
Chin, chin.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.640
Prosit.

07:25.680 --> 07:28.560
Someone is not celebrating.

07:28.600 --> 07:33.520
Win some, lose some.
Or in their case, lose some, lose some.

07:33.560 --> 07:37.600
Speaking of which. When's your name
vice-CEO, Massimo...

07:37.640 --> 07:39.720
Which one of you
becomes head of trading?

07:39.760 --> 07:43.560
Since Paul is not here at the moment, I say we take him out of the running.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.720
Seems fair enough.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.760
I'll let all three of you know
when and if I get the job.

07:49.520 --> 07:52.520
Come on, Massimo. We all know you'll get the job.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.600
You've earned it, Massimo.
If you don't, there's no justice in the world.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.520
Or at least at NYL.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.640
I almost forgotten... For you.

08:08.760 --> 08:12.640
Who gave you this?
It was on the table when we got here.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.640
Was it Paul? I don't known.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.680
Come on.
Seriously.

08:22.560 --> 08:26.520
Okay, see you in a minute.

08:36.559 --> 08:40.640
Are you Massimo Ruggero?
Yes. Do I know you?

08:40.679 --> 08:43.520
Sofia Flores. I'm a reporter.

08:43.559 --> 08:46.480
I don't recognize the name, sorry.
I'm a blogger, actually.

08:46.480 --> 08:49.000
Oh, a blogger.
Yeah. It's ok.

08:49.480 --> 08:52.720
But one interview with you
and I'd finally get published.

08:53.480 --> 08:54.480
Why me?

08:54.600 --> 08:58.520
Because you know what it's like to be a foreigner
trying to make it in the Anglo-Saxon world.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.680
Yes. I know.
So?

09:00.720 --> 09:04.560
Are you Spanish?
I'm from Argentina.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.720
I wish you well, ms. Flores.
No...

09:08.760 --> 09:10.760
Oh, sorry.

11:28.720 --> 11:35.560
Carrie? No, wait. Please! Wait!

12:09.520 --> 12:11.560
"What the fuck is water?"

12:13.520 --> 12:16.600
I don't get it.
"What the fuck is water", they don't know they're fish.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.480
They don't even know what water is.

12:18.760 --> 12:19.600
We have to go.
Now?

12:19.640 --> 12:23.720
I' was about to order another round of drinks.
Carrie was here.

12:23.760 --> 12:27.680
Sorry.
I'll be right back.

12:27.720 --> 12:30.600
What was..?
Come on guys.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.720
Carrie as a hooker giving lap dances?

12:35.520 --> 12:37.760
I mean, are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.

12:38.520 --> 12:43.560
If she really is back,
getting you as a client is kind of a coincidence.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.760
It's not a coincidence. Someone went a lot of trouble to make sure I saw her.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.600
"The banker's ex wife is an escort".

12:50.640 --> 12:55.560
I'm not sure the board will enjoy reading
that headline in the Sunday Times.

12:55.600 --> 13:01.600
Ed Stuart. If you don't get that job,
Ed Stuart does. It had to be him.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.520
Look through his portfolio.
What are we looking for?

13:05.520 --> 13:07.520
I don't know, but be careful.

13:11.680 --> 13:14.600
Good morning. Thanks for joining us...

13:14.640 --> 13:17.680
Professor Wade. I thought you'd be up.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.680
As of at old age, you can't sleep
more than four to five at the time.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.720
Think of all the
extra work you get done.

13:24.760 --> 13:28.600
I should bloody hell retire
on an island or something. So should you.

13:28.640 --> 13:33.560
Yes, one day.
Meantime I need a favor.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.640
I like when you
ask a favor. Do tell.

13:36.680 --> 13:41.760
Do you have any bright young students eager to impress?
I need some forensic work.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.640
You have all a forensic
department on the 23rd floor.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.640
It has to be done off the books.

13:48.680 --> 13:51.600
I think I might find someone.

13:52.640 --> 13:59.600
Massimo, is everything alright?
No, it's not.

14:27.680 --> 14:33.680
Bloody hell Massimo. What are you doing here?
Looking for my wife.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.720
Come in.
How've you been?

14:36.520 --> 14:40.680
Have you seen her?
Not for a couple of years.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.560
Last I heard she was in the States.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.680
Coffee?
No thank you.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.640
I remember when she painted it.

15:03.520 --> 15:07.600
It's my favorite. God, she was talented.

15:07.640 --> 15:11.680
Yeah, but Carrie was always two people, wasn't she?

15:11.720 --> 15:13.680
Dark and light.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.680
Hello.
Hello.

15:20.680 --> 15:24.560
From now on, I'll take care of you.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.600
We had some good times together.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.640
You certainly did.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.640
I saw her in London last night.
Yeah?

15:41.680 --> 15:46.560
Working as a call-girl.
Shit. Things have gone that bad?

15:48.600 --> 15:53.760
I've got to find her.
She is in more trouble than she knows.

15:55.520 --> 16:00.720
Whatever Carrie has got into,
is not your job to look after her anymore.

16:00.760 --> 16:06.600
Someone is trying to destroy me.
They mean to use her to do it.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.600
Will you help?

16:12.720 --> 16:16.720
I'll phone around her old friends.
See what I can find out.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.640
Thanks.

16:40.720 --> 16:45.520
There's still an hour to go.
I don't need it. All done.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.560
Than I invite you to take the free time
to look through your answers.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.640
Oh no, they are right.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.640
Thanks.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.720
You finished awfully fast.

17:00.760 --> 17:05.640
Yeah, If you fail,
you get your money back. Now pay up.

17:05.680 --> 17:10.720
Is that the going rate for
sitting in another student's exam?

17:12.640 --> 17:13.720
I needed the money.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.680
And when you'll get thrown out the university you'll also need the money.

17:17.720 --> 17:21.680
Only you'll not have any prospect of earning any.
Am I being thrown out?

17:22.640 --> 17:25.000
You are already on thin ice after
you hacked LSE database

17:25.000 --> 17:30.680
Released thousands of research papers.
Students do not have to pay for...

17:30.720 --> 17:33.600
Point being.. This is not your first offense, Mr. Harris.

17:39.520 --> 17:43.600
Perhaps you should have been expelled.
You're smart, Oliver.

17:44.760 --> 17:49.600
One of the brightest I've taught.
And I've taught a few.

17:49.640 --> 17:54.520
Don't give some privileged rich kid
the satisfaction of getting first,

17:54.560 --> 17:57.520
on the back of your hard work.

18:02.720 --> 18:07.560
Do you have any classes this afternoon?
Nothing I can't miss.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.600
Good. I have a job for you.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.720
What have you got?

18:41.520 --> 18:44.720
We may have found a way to strike back against Stuart
but we have to move quickly.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.760
What is it?
Davenport BioTech wants to move in the Mid East.

18:47.840 --> 18:52.560
Ed's is in the mid of a huge refinance deal.
If the deal goes through it's worth 50 million in commission.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.720
If it doesn't,
the bank will have to make up the loss.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.640
50 million will be a lot of blood on Ed's nose.

18:57.680 --> 19:00.640
Davenport's balance sheet is rock solid.

19:00.680 --> 19:04.720
Why refinance and diluting that stock?
That we don't know.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.000
Whatever the reason we are exposed on this thing
And the Davenport deal'll close Tuesday.

19:08.640 --> 19:13.480
It's the same day the new vice CEO in announced.
Even if Ed wasn't behind it, he's your only competition.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.480
We can weak his, strengthen yours.

19:15.640 --> 19:20.520
If Dominic finds out, he'd make sure you'll
never work in the city again.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.720
You're our boss, not Dominic.
We've got your back Max.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.720
What do you want us to do?
Ok, short Davenport.

19:28.520 --> 19:31.680
But we're outside brokers.
No one can know it can from us.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.680
And guys.. Thank you.

19:37.520 --> 19:41.720
21st century human health challenges demands
21st century meta-human solutions.

19:42.520 --> 19:47.600
That's why we, at Davenport, have developed
bionic and nanotechnology.

19:47.640 --> 19:54.600
See things as they are.
Davenport BioTech defining the future.

19:54.640 --> 19:59.560
Well, I think you can see why we are all so excited
about this investment opportunity.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.720
We live in a world where
perception is everything.

20:03.520 --> 20:07.720
We at Davenport believe that not only
should you have the appearance of being the best.

20:07.760 --> 20:10.560
You should be the best.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.680
Is there a problem?
You tell me John.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.680
I thought we were always straight to each other.

20:31.720 --> 20:36.560
Am I meant to guess what you're talking about?
Someone started shorting your stocks an hour ago.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.640
What?
That's when an investor borrows shares and immediately sells them

20:39.680 --> 20:43.280
in order to buy them back in the later day
to the low price and pockets difference.

20:43.360 --> 20:46.160
Yes I know what stock shorting is
What the hell is going on?

20:46.480 --> 20:49.640
Evidently they believed your stocks will fall,
and if it does they stands to get a lot of money.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.280
You've seen our books.
The company is solid.
Evidently they believed your stocks will fall,
and if it does they stands to get a lot of money.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.520
You've seen our books.
The company is solid.

20:53.560 --> 20:57.560
Alright. I'll look into it
but there better not be any surprises.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.680
We both have a lot riding on this \,and the market doesn't like surprises.

21:00.720 --> 21:05.600
The only surprise is that you'd dare
think I'd deceive my investors.

21:05.640 --> 21:10.520
Now, I paid your bank a lot of
money, I expect results.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.600
Kate. I'm just going
to get some coffee.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.640
The lift is going down, Ed.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.640
Are you alright?
I'm fine.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.520
You seem a little stressed.

22:07.560 --> 22:11.520
I neither need or want your concern.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.720
Am I supposed to know what that means?

22:20.520 --> 22:23.600
An Italian judge said it
after the mafia threatened him.

22:24.680 --> 22:28.680
This isn't Italy Mr. Ruggero
and banking is a legalized crime.

22:28.720 --> 22:33.640
At least you didn't use to be until
people like you showed up.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.720
People like me?
Do you have any idea how may generations my family have been in banking?

22:36.760 --> 22:38.720
My great-grandfather was
governor of the Bank of England.

22:38.760 --> 22:42.720
For us, this line of work has always been about
safe guarding people's savings,

22:43.520 --> 22:47.640
Not risking them in some sort of gambling hall.
Banking used to be a noble profession.

22:47.680 --> 22:51.600
But unfortunately in these days
it seems stoop ever lower

22:52.680 --> 22:57.520
I was born low.
The only way I could ever go was up.

23:02.640 --> 23:05.720
Unfortunately, in your case, the only way is down.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.760
Hey.

23:27.680 --> 23:31.600
Am I being ambushed, ms. Flores?
Maybe.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.680
I really need that interview, Mr Ruggero.

23:36.720 --> 23:39.720
It's Massimo.
And I read your blog, you're a good writer.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.640
Thank you. \,But it's still not a good time, sorry.

23:42.680 --> 23:47.680
I thought you of all people would help
a poor girl from Argentina.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.720
Why me?
Because you're a poor boy from a fishing village.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.560
I don't know how you found that out Ms Flores.

23:56.600 --> 24:01.520
You mean because you wiped out your
personal history from the internet? I have my ways.

24:01.560 --> 24:05.720
I'd like to hear more about them.
Cool. How about we talk over a dinner?

24:07.720 --> 24:09.760
You're nothing if not persistent.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.720
Alright. Eleven o'clock at my place.

24:17.520 --> 24:23.560
Thank you. What can I bring?
Just yourself. See you.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.560
Don't worry.

24:51.600 --> 24:54.560
Oliver. Nice to meet you.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.640
What can I get you?
Espresso, single.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.560
A cup of tea.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.640
Milk and sugar? No milk, four sugars.

25:04.680 --> 25:07.520
Girl won't let me have it at home so..

25:07.560 --> 25:11.600
Maybe you should listen to her.
That's what she says.

25:13.640 --> 25:17.640
So you left your phone at the office?
Yes.

25:17.680 --> 25:20.680
Will we able to get into Davenports?
Yeah.

25:20.720 --> 25:25.720
He and Stuart are meeting
a reporter from the Financial Times.

25:25.760 --> 25:28.640
Fred Worlick?
Yes, Monday for lunch at a place called <i>Coq d'Or</i>.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.640
Ok I need to hear what they're saying
Can you do that?

25:31.680 --> 25:34.640
Yes I can use his phone as a voice recorder
if I'm sitting in Bluetooth range.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.600
Okay.

25:36.640 --> 25:40.560
Do you mind if I ask why you are
spying on one of your own colleagues?

25:40.600 --> 25:44.600
I mean, Mr. Stuart does work for your bank, doesn't he?

25:44.640 --> 25:46.640
Thank you.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.640
What about Carrie?

25:49.680 --> 25:53.680
She entered the country
six weeks ago with a British passport.

25:53.720 --> 25:57.520
Did she gave an address?
Yours.

25:57.560 --> 26:02.680
But she must living on cash,
completely off the books. Her mobile phone thrown away.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.560
I'm sorry, I've got nothing.

26:09.720 --> 26:14.600
Okay. Keep looking.

26:15.720 --> 26:21.520
Mr. Ruggero... Thank you
for this opportunity.

26:21.560 --> 26:22.720
It's Massimo.

26:24.760 --> 26:28.520
What about your coffee?
You drink it.

26:31.520 --> 26:36.520
In Athens a day of strikes and protests across Greece
evolved into deadly riots.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.760
Tens of thousands of people have
taken to the streets.

26:42.680 --> 26:47.680
Hey. Am I too early?
It's perfect. Come in.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.680
Cool. Thanks.

26:51.560 --> 26:54.560
Can I take your coat?
Oh please, thanks.

26:57.520 --> 27:00.600
This is amazing.
Thank you.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.600
Glass of wine?
I love wine.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.680
White is it okay?
Perfect.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.640
We're live on the ground as the story...

27:08.680 --> 27:11.680
Oh, your ex-wife. She is beautiful.

27:11.720 --> 27:15.560
You seems to know an
awful lot about me, Ms. Flores.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.640
Sofia.

27:25.760 --> 27:29.600
Whatever you're cooking, it smells delicious.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.760
The secret is the fish.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.720
Thank you.

27:34.520 --> 27:41.600
How fresh it is, where it is caught.
As we do in Cetara.

27:41.640 --> 27:45.600
But you already know that about me. How?

27:49.520 --> 27:53.680
Once something is exposed on the internet,
it can never be covered up.

27:53.720 --> 27:57.640
Well yes but not if you know what
you're looking for.

28:06.600 --> 28:12.680
So, what's the interview about?
What's all over the news. Financial crisis in Greece.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.600
What about it?

28:14.640 --> 28:19.640
Is Greece the problem, or is the problem
about to become the whole of Europe?

28:19.680 --> 28:21.520
Good question, Ms Flores.

28:21.560 --> 28:24.600
I told you, Sofia.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.560
Sofia. Okay.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.640
I just trade in the markets.
I don't predict them.

28:31.680 --> 28:35.720
Some say the best way to predict
the markets, is to cause them.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.560
So you think my bank is causing
Greece to fail?

28:48.680 --> 28:54.640
I think maybe someone is. But I
do not know. I am asking you.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.640
You want an honest answer?

29:02.640 --> 29:04.640
I have to give it some thought.

29:04.680 --> 29:08.680
Sure, of course.
Maybe we could have dinner again...

29:08.720 --> 29:11.640
I think one interview is enough.

30:31.640 --> 30:35.520
You said one day we would get a
place like this.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.520
And you said it
wouldn't make us happy.

30:42.640 --> 30:45.560
Looks like we were both right.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.640
Oh, your ex-wife. She is beautiful.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.760
You seems to know an
awful lot about me, Ms. Flores.

31:52.600 --> 31:53.760
Kalim?
What's up?

31:53.840 --> 31:55.600
I don't want security involved.

31:55.600 --> 32:00.520
When you get in, check out our system.
We may have been hacked.

32:06.560 --> 32:11.600
John lost his life in a fire fight outside
Basra nearly three years ago.

32:11.640 --> 32:18.640
No words can describe the grief
a parent feels for the loss of a son.

32:18.680 --> 32:21.560
I speak for my wife, Nina, and myself

32:21.600 --> 32:26.760
when I say that John's loss leaves a hole in
our hearts we can never fill.

32:27.560 --> 32:29.720
But we are left with extreme pride.

32:29.760 --> 32:34.600
Pride that a young man chose sacrifice
over self interest.

32:34.640 --> 32:38.720
A young man born with privilege,
would forsake that to serve his country.

32:38.760 --> 32:43.520
I can't bear it anymore.
Can you take me home?

32:47.680 --> 32:54.640
If you would indulge me I'd like to... share some
memories of our remarkable son.

33:00.560 --> 33:06.560
For him to talk about sacrifice...
It was Dominic that John run away from.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.720
Dominic didn't want John
to join the army, Nina.

33:11.520 --> 33:15.600
But he didn't try very
bloody hell to stop him, did he?

33:17.720 --> 33:22.680
He wanted him to come
back begging for a job in the bank.

33:22.720 --> 33:27.680
But John would rather die than
give him the satisfaction. And he did.

33:27.720 --> 33:31.520
I was with him when he got the news.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.560
Of course you were. You always are.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.680
It destroyed him.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.560
And yet,
I've never seen him shed a tear.

33:43.520 --> 33:48.640
Being with Dominic it costs people.
You should know that better than anyone.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.560
Ready, aim, fire!

33:56.560 --> 33:59.720
Aim, fire! Fire!

34:23.719 --> 34:25.639
Hey.

34:25.679 --> 34:28.600
Thanks for bringing Nina home.

34:28.639 --> 34:32.600
Don't worry.
She relies on you, you know? We both do.

34:32.639 --> 34:34.760
I'm so sorry for your loss.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.520
You have been a great comfort to me.

34:38.600 --> 34:42.600
Which is why this business with Ed Stuart
is just so damn upsetting.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.639
I saw the two of you talking.

34:44.679 --> 34:48.600
He is paranoid. He thinks you're
somehow plotting against him.

34:48.639 --> 34:51.679
Yeah, why would I need to?
Which is exactly what I said.

34:51.719 --> 34:54.639
By the way, have you heard from Carrie lately?

34:57.640 --> 34:59.520
No.

35:00.720 --> 35:03.680
Why do you ask?
No reason.

35:03.720 --> 35:09.560
Occasions like this always bring back ghosts.
Yes.

35:10.640 --> 35:13.560
I hope you'll forgive me
but I can't stay for lunch

35:13.600 --> 35:15.560
Of course.

35:31.640 --> 35:32.760
Hey.

35:35.640 --> 35:40.600
Is that your only suit?
Ah yeah, I had to borrow this one from a friend, so...

35:41.640 --> 35:43.720
I guess it'll have to do.

35:43.760 --> 35:48.560
I booked a table under
the name "Smith". Table right next to his.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.720
Good.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.520
Is that all for lunch?

35:54.560 --> 35:59.520
Do you want good press?
Take your reporter to an expensive restaurant. See you later.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.720
Mr. Smith. Table for one.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.640
Please follow me.

36:15.680 --> 36:19.720
Excuse me... I reserved a table, but there.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.760
I'm afraid those tables are taken.
This is all we have.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.560
An aperitif?

36:35.640 --> 36:38.680
A drink, sir?
Yeah, coke, please. Thanks.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.560
Your coke, sir.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.640
Well?
It cost 60 quids.

37:51.680 --> 37:56.640
But that was the best
hamburger I've had in my entire life.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.640
I meant, what they were saying?

37:58.680 --> 38:02.680
Oh no a bastard set me by the toilet.
Too far away to get anything.

38:04.720 --> 38:07.520
You got nothing?
I didn't say that.

38:07.560 --> 38:12.720
It wasn't obvious, but I saw something
about Davenport. He trembles.

38:13.520 --> 38:16.600
Even so subtly like his foot and his hands.
So I checked his diary.

38:16.640 --> 38:20.680
Three times in the last six months he has been
to see a dr. Nicholas Meyer on Ally Street.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.600
A neurologist?
Exactly.

38:22.640 --> 38:28.640
It could be a kind of like, motoneuron disease.
Or it could be nothing.

38:28.680 --> 38:33.600
Were you able to access
mails and medical records?

38:33.640 --> 38:36.560
No, his records are on his computer.

38:38.760 --> 38:42.600
What's that?
An old friend of my wife's, Greg Bowman.

38:42.640 --> 38:45.680
I asked for his help to find her.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.560
Has he?

38:50.600 --> 38:52.560
I need you to make sure.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.560
Well?

39:15.600 --> 39:17.680
We've ask around, there's anything hidden on Davenport sale.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.720
He just for life insurance two years ago
he would have had a full medical exam.

39:20.760 --> 39:24.560
If what you guys are saying is true,
there's no way to prove it.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.680
We could leak the news anyway.
What if he's not sick?

39:26.720 --> 39:29.640
Either way the news would confidence in his stocks.

39:29.680 --> 39:33.640
Unless it gets traced back to the same people who
are running a massive short against him.

39:33.680 --> 39:36.760
Then Davenport find him and we're fucked.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.600
That's a rumor, no legitimate newspaper would run it
So what do we do?

39:42.640 --> 39:46.520
So Subterranea is not the only other organization out there

39:46.560 --> 39:49.560
alongside Assange fighting for the truth.

39:49.600 --> 39:54.720
You've got Cryptome,
which was founded all the way back in 199...

39:55.520 --> 39:57.600
1996.
96. Exactly.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.720
You've got GlobaLeaks, OpenLeaks...

39:59.760 --> 40:03.640
You know, most of its collaborator actually came from WikiLeaks

40:03.680 --> 40:07.640
because they were
frustrated with Julian's...

40:07.680 --> 40:14.640
One of its key strategy is a brilliant
programmer called the Architect.

40:14.680 --> 40:21.520
I just want to point out if he's listening on this now...
I'd love to meet.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.760
Hello?
It's Massimo. I need to see you.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.520
What, now?
Yes, now.

40:30.560 --> 40:33.680
Sure. Where?
At my place.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.640
I can be there in 20 minutes.
Good.

40:41.560 --> 40:44.520
Anger and violence erupting on
the streets of Athens

40:44.560 --> 40:47.560
And protests over Greece's measures...

40:47.600 --> 40:50.520
Is something wrong?

40:59.600 --> 41:04.720
You are not a blogger. You're working
for an anarchist group called Subterranea.

41:05.520 --> 41:06.640
How do you know that?

41:06.680 --> 41:10.640
Like you said, when something is on the internet
it can never really be hidden .

41:13.680 --> 41:18.520
Lying is not a crime, or you and your friends
would have been in prison a long time ago.

41:18.560 --> 41:22.600
A lie may not be a crime,
but planting one of this, is.

41:24.640 --> 41:28.560
The cops would release
me in five minutes.

41:29.680 --> 41:34.680
Would they? Your group is on the list of Interpol.
Well, I am not.

41:34.720 --> 41:41.600
After they set fire to a bank.
Three people were burned to death.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.640
Where are you going?

41:45.600 --> 41:50.640
What is it you want, Massimo?
Subterranea trades informations.

41:50.680 --> 41:54.680
I want you to make sure that
some information goes viral.

41:56.560 --> 42:02.680
What kind of information?
About a client. John Davenport.

42:13.720 --> 42:16.680
Good morning, Mr. Stuart.
Good morning.

42:36.520 --> 42:40.760
Hi, Mark, how are you?. Did you see the piece?
What you mean pulling the investment?

42:41.520 --> 42:45.520
No, you came to me, begging me
for as much stocks to as you could get.

42:45.560 --> 42:48.720
That's bullshit Mark! If Davenport were ill,
I would know about it.

42:52.640 --> 42:55.720
Is Ed looking this way?
He sure is.

42:56.520 --> 42:58.760
Davenport sitting rock bottom.
Poor bastard.

42:59.560 --> 43:03.600
Don't dance on his grave just yet.
Davenport has called a news conference at 1.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.760
What he's gonna say?
Don't known.

43:08.560 --> 43:09.640
Yes?

43:09.680 --> 43:13.560
I'm texting you an address.
You better come over here now.

43:13.600 --> 43:18.600
What is it?
It's your wife. I found her.

43:23.600 --> 43:26.640
How long have you known
she's hiding here?

43:26.680 --> 43:27.480
You had me followed?

43:27.560 --> 43:29.720
Why didn't you tell me?
Because she didn't want to see you.

43:29.720 --> 43:33.680
She still doesn't. Leave her alone!
Fuck you!

43:42.600 --> 43:44.720
Carrie! Carrie, it's me.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.680
She wasn't like this a couple of minutes ago.

43:58.720 --> 44:03.560
What has she taken? I found her like this
Is she on any medication? I don't know what she's on now.

44:03.600 --> 44:08.520
She used to take lithium and Clozapine.
Wait here Mr. Ruggero, we'll do all we can.

44:12.560 --> 44:17.600
First of all thank you very much for coming.
I'll be making a short statement.

44:17.640 --> 44:22.520
There were reports in the press recently,
concerning my health.

44:22.560 --> 44:26.720
And I'm sorry to say that,
they are true.

44:27.520 --> 44:30.640
I was diagnosed with
Huntington's disease, six months ago.

44:30.680 --> 44:34.520
I saw my illness as a personal issue.

44:34.560 --> 44:39.520
And I only regret that my
family had to find about my diagnosis this way.

44:39.560 --> 44:41.600
Goodbye, John Davenport.

44:41.640 --> 44:46.720
And Ed Stuart. He just cost the
bank £ 50m. Good job, Max.

44:47.520 --> 44:50.600
I ask you to respect
the privacy of my family.

44:50.640 --> 44:54.600
Massimo. Mr. Morgan would like to see you.

44:56.520 --> 45:01.720
I will not go into details now..

45:09.520 --> 45:11.720
I trust you saw the news on Davenport.

45:12.520 --> 45:15.600
I did
It's an embarrassment to us. And costly.

45:15.640 --> 45:17.560
Ed should have done his homework.

45:18.760 --> 45:21.560
Clearly somebody did.

45:23.680 --> 45:29.560
You should have told me
About Carrie.

45:30.720 --> 45:34.640
How do you expect me to protect you
if you don't tell me the truth?

45:35.680 --> 45:38.680
Boards isn't gonna make you vice-CEO.

45:43.680 --> 45:45.520
Because of Carrie?

45:45.560 --> 45:48.840
Because of a bipolar drug addict
the last I heard was legally your wife.

45:48.880 --> 45:49.680
This is bullshit.

45:49.680 --> 45:52.640
Jesus Massimo do you have any idea
what it takes to be able to sit to this chair?

45:52.680 --> 45:56.600
What few mistakes you can make?
Did you honestly imagined  you could make a mistake like her?

45:56.600 --> 45:58.600
This was a setup.
Someone brought Carrie back to London.

45:58.640 --> 46:00.640
You're being paranoid.
I'm not paranoid.

46:00.680 --> 46:03.600
Who told you about Carrie?
You said you were loyal.

46:03.640 --> 46:06.600
Was it Ed? Is he getting the job?
Are you loyal?!

46:27.520 --> 46:30.640
Donna, where is he? I'm sorry Mr Ruggero, I really don't know.

46:38.520 --> 46:41.640
Good afternoon, Donna. Do you
know where I can find my husband?

48:17.640 --> 48:22.720
I hear the devil speaking to me.
Whispering in my ear.

48:24.640 --> 48:25.720
He struck my ego.

48:30.680 --> 48:37.680
The devil's greatest trick..
isn't making us think he doesn't exist.

48:39.760 --> 48:45.760
It's flattering us...
so we don't see...

48:48.600 --> 48:50.720
The devil is us.
