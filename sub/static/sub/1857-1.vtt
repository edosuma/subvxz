01:12.583 --> 01:14.832
How it started shouldn't matter.

01:14.833 --> 01:19.457
How things end,
that's what's important.

01:19.458 --> 01:22.515
Well, that's the theory.

01:53.791 --> 01:55.332
Sorry to keep you, Mr Barker.

01:55.333 --> 01:56.499
That's not a problem.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.249
I just need to run you through
a quick security check.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.582
Could you please tell me
your mother's maiden name.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.957
- Tilly.
- And your date of birth.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.432
Sixth of July, 1962.

02:07.458 --> 02:09.957
Excellent, Mr Barker. You've
passed the security test.

02:09.958 --> 02:13.932
If I could just confirm your order with
you before I put it through the system.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.807
The number.

02:19.458 --> 02:24.332
So, you've placed an order for six
limited edition 18-karat gold rings

02:24.333 --> 02:27.249
and four pendant
white gold necklaces.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.665
Delivery will have to be made

02:28.666 --> 02:30.374
to the address that the
card is registered to,

02:30.375 --> 02:32.540
so you'll have to be home
to sign for the items.

02:32.541 --> 02:36.640
Of course. If you could deliver at
8:00 a.m. tomorrow that would be great.

02:39.333 --> 02:42.874
If you could actually grow stubble,
you wouldn't have to wear that thing?

02:42.875 --> 02:46.249
You think that pubestache you grew
for Movember counts as facial hair?

02:46.250 --> 02:48.057
Don't make me laugh.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.790
Right, do I have to tell
you to drive carefully?

02:58.791 --> 03:02.082
Only if you value your paintwork.
Go learn something.

03:02.083 --> 03:03.624
Go make some money.

03:03.625 --> 03:07.290
65 million years ago,
a comet hit this planet

03:07.291 --> 03:11.290
with the power of a
million Hiroshima bombs.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.957
It wiped out the dinosaurs,

03:12.958 --> 03:16.082
and from the ashes rose a
whole new world order.

03:16.083 --> 03:17.915
A fitting metaphor

03:17.916 --> 03:21.140
for the global recession we
still find ourselves in.

03:21.541 --> 03:24.790
When demand is so low
for a prolonged period,

03:24.791 --> 03:29.082
a whole generation of educated
and trained suppliers,

03:29.083 --> 03:31.082
that's you guys by the way,

03:31.083 --> 03:32.707
may never work.

03:32.708 --> 03:38.390
Many of you will achieve good degrees but
never actually get the careers you want.

03:41.583 --> 03:43.374
Can I try these on?

03:43.375 --> 03:44.832
No.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.540
Well, how am I supposed to
know if they're going to fit?

03:47.541 --> 03:50.415
You can look at the label or
buy 'em. I'm not bothered.

03:50.416 --> 03:52.249
How much for the iPod dock?

03:52.250 --> 03:54.099
They're 100.

03:54.708 --> 03:57.749
Wait one second, Daniel, you're
third year business studies.

03:57.750 --> 03:58.874
So what?

03:58.875 --> 04:01.165
So fucking haggle,
brother, that's what.

04:01.166 --> 04:05.499
Yeah, yeah. So,
what do I get for 60?

04:05.500 --> 04:06.832
Not one of those.

04:06.833 --> 04:08.665
Come on, that's a good offer.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.707
So was 100 before he stepped in.

04:10.708 --> 04:14.474
£70 and I'll take
the jeans as well.

04:15.416 --> 04:18.599
80, you buy the dock
and he buys the jeans.

04:18.958 --> 04:21.124
Can I try them on first?

04:21.125 --> 04:23.432
Well, mate, yeah, if you must.

04:29.916 --> 04:33.665
Jesus Christ, has your mate
got an aversion to underwear?

04:33.666 --> 04:38.749
All dirty, I'm afraid. Mum's
not down till the weekend

04:38.750 --> 04:42.640
and I'll be fucked if I'm
doing my own laundry.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.499
How goes it, Mr Yates?

04:52.500 --> 04:55.040
Good thanks, Dion. How about you?

04:55.041 --> 04:57.765
Busy. Always busy.

04:57.958 --> 04:59.332
What d'you need?

04:59.333 --> 05:01.140
I'll go for three.

05:01.291 --> 05:06.207
Listen, you know I spoke to my boss.
Told him I got much respect for you.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.290
Man reckons he might be
able to put you to work.

05:08.291 --> 05:12.307
Always looking for people
to open up new markets.

05:12.958 --> 05:16.790
The guy two rungs above me is
pulling in like half a million a week.

05:16.791 --> 05:19.557
Cash. In hand.

05:23.666 --> 05:27.890
Your boss... Tell him
I'll think about it.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.099
Thank you.

05:37.666 --> 05:41.082
Rafa, Rafa, quickly! The
toilet's overflowing again.

05:41.083 --> 05:44.265
Get a mop and a plastic bag.
It's like Baghdad in there.

05:48.958 --> 05:50.624
We got a customer.

05:50.625 --> 05:51.790
So?

05:51.791 --> 05:55.557
So you don't know how to use the
new till system yet, do you?

05:55.625 --> 05:56.915
I keep saying it.

05:56.916 --> 05:59.040
Until you can be bothered
to learn this stuff,

05:59.041 --> 06:02.307
I serve the customers and you
clean up what they leave behind.

06:06.416 --> 06:09.224
All right. Good.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.707
That'll be £65 exactly,
boss. Anything else?

06:18.708 --> 06:20.599
Condoms.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.307
Ribbed.

06:23.041 --> 06:24.765
Lucky girl.

06:25.166 --> 06:27.224
I see you like Ferraris.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.540
Take another look.

06:28.541 --> 06:31.890
This is as close as you're
ever gonna get to one.

06:34.625 --> 06:37.790
See that girl out there that
you're gonna be using these on?

06:37.791 --> 06:40.124
She like personality and
looks, or just money?

06:40.125 --> 06:43.515
What do you think? She's all
about the money, dickhead.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.599
Then why is it she's chatting
up the guy without the Ferrari?

07:02.875 --> 07:04.332
You showed him, eh, boss?

07:04.333 --> 07:07.624
D'you want me to come back
round there and fuck your face?

07:07.625 --> 07:09.724
Swipe the card.

07:09.958 --> 07:12.182
You gotta, actually.

07:12.916 --> 07:14.932
Chip and pin now.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.682
And that's you done, then.

07:24.791 --> 07:26.640
Thank you so much.

07:28.916 --> 07:29.999
Good shift?

07:30.000 --> 07:35.540
Usual. Shit. While you guys are out
having fun I smell petrol fumes

07:35.541 --> 07:37.890
and deal with fucking wankers.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.182
Feel like taking it
out on someone else?

07:49.875 --> 07:51.849
What the... Christ!

07:51.875 --> 07:55.082
Evening chief. Good performance
for a guy your age.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.457
Budget not stretch to a hotel room?

07:56.458 --> 07:57.915
Off you get, love.

07:57.916 --> 07:59.290
Can I leave now?

07:59.291 --> 08:01.040
Don't wanna finish up here?

08:01.041 --> 08:04.099
- You've seen the state of him.
- Yeah, I have.

08:04.291 --> 08:06.099
Now give me your wallet.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.890
Fuck you.

08:07.916 --> 08:09.249
You getting all this?

08:09.250 --> 08:11.349
In high definition, mate.

08:13.083 --> 08:18.624
Now, here's what you do. Write
down your mother's maiden name,

08:18.625 --> 08:20.582
pin number and date of birth.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.040
Go fuck yourself.

08:22.041 --> 08:23.582
This is 4G enabled, mate.

08:23.583 --> 08:25.624
I can have this on the
Internet in 30 seconds

08:25.625 --> 08:28.207
and send it to your wife, see
what she's got to say about it.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.415
"Go fuck yourself", sounds about
right. Probably followed by,

08:31.416 --> 08:34.140
"I want a divorce," and
"You've never made me come."

08:39.750 --> 08:41.249
Well done.

08:41.250 --> 08:44.540
Now, all we ask is that you don't
report the cards stolen for 24 hours

08:44.541 --> 08:46.457
whilst we do a spot of shopping.

08:46.458 --> 08:49.140
Just relax and let the
insurance foot the bill.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.374
And we'll take that briefcase
if it's all the same with you.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.207
You can take the wallet,
you can take the cards.

08:54.208 --> 08:55.790
But I can't give you the case.

08:55.791 --> 08:58.249
Don't act like I'm
giving you a choice.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.974
Grab it.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.890
- No!
- Yatesey, fuck!

09:07.458 --> 09:09.432
Shit. Is he fucking dead?

09:11.291 --> 09:13.474
He'll live. Come on.

09:23.625 --> 09:26.974
Holy shit. Look at this!

09:27.291 --> 09:28.932
Nice.

09:29.916 --> 09:31.765
What's this?

09:38.541 --> 09:40.332
Always wanted one of those.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.099
That's mine, that is.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.457
All right.

09:44.458 --> 09:48.290
There's like fucking five grand in
here. What's that, 1,250 each?

09:48.291 --> 09:50.557
Only if we split it four ways.

09:51.166 --> 09:54.974
Cards go into the pot, that's
standard, but the money's ours.

09:55.958 --> 09:58.040
I don't know, mate. We're
supposed to split everything.

09:58.041 --> 10:00.249
You think they'd do
the same for us?

10:00.250 --> 10:03.332
They got you stuck in a petrol
garage five nights a week.

10:03.333 --> 10:06.290
You need to start looking
out for yourself, mate.

10:06.291 --> 10:09.057
Stop letting people take
the piss out of you.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.624
Yeah.

10:20.625 --> 10:25.682
Marcel, it's Harry. We've
got a serious problem.

10:38.500 --> 10:42.682
All right, lads? Five cards
cloned from the garage.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.665
And we rolled a mark.

10:44.666 --> 10:47.957
Picked up another two cards
with pin numbers for both.

10:47.958 --> 10:50.707
You should watch the video,
mate. It's fucking hilarious...

10:50.708 --> 10:52.624
- Shit!
- What?

10:52.625 --> 10:54.932
I lost a life. Game over.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.932
Gents.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.790
Someone please tell me
why's he wearing that.

11:02.791 --> 11:05.099
It's fancy dress tonight.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.499
Wait, don't tell me you lot forgot.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.974
We're still going to that?

11:18.666 --> 11:20.432
Surprisingly epic.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.474
I'm going to the bar.

11:28.083 --> 11:29.790
She the one in your
class, isn't she?

11:29.791 --> 11:30.874
Yeah.

11:30.875 --> 11:33.499
The one you said's been checking
you out, which I don't believe.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.582
Yeah.

11:34.583 --> 11:36.290
Then what you doing here?

11:36.291 --> 11:38.874
Stop staring at her like a
serial killer and talk to her.

11:38.875 --> 11:40.457
I'm working up to it.

11:40.458 --> 11:43.332
She's nice, mate. Almost
as fit as Fordy's sister.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.540
My sister's 15, you fucking paedo.

11:45.541 --> 11:47.999
Give her my number and tell
her to call me in a year.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.332
Yeah, will do. Cheers, Rafa.
She's been dreaming about meeting

11:50.333 --> 11:52.999
a bell-end that works in a petrol
station since she was a little girl.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.640
All right.

12:00.833 --> 12:02.749
Oh, for fuck's sake.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.207
You snooze, you lose.

12:04.208 --> 12:07.874
I swear my man's an apex
predator. Watch him go.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.499
Look, hang on, hang on.
New world record!

12:10.500 --> 12:12.624
Arm touch in under five seconds.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.832
She touched his arm? Big deal.

12:14.833 --> 12:18.682
May as well have been his cock,
mate. Yatesey won't fuck this up.

12:20.916 --> 12:22.515
What the fuck?

12:23.375 --> 12:25.749
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

12:25.750 --> 12:27.374
Leaving a girl like
that at the bar, mate?

12:27.375 --> 12:30.974
You should have taken that shit
down. You're a fuckin' predator.

12:31.416 --> 12:33.957
That right there is a
five date shag, Raf.

12:33.958 --> 12:37.082
Three hours chat for a kiss
good night at her front door.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.499
I'm not looking for a
girlfriend right now.

12:39.500 --> 12:45.057
I like her, don't get me wrong.
She'll get done, just not tonight.

12:45.458 --> 12:46.915
Charming. Right.

12:46.916 --> 12:48.765
You going in?

12:50.450 --> 12:52.640
This'll be good viewing.

12:57.208 --> 12:59.707
Sam, good costume.

12:59.708 --> 13:01.249
Thank you. Where's yours?

13:01.250 --> 13:02.624
I didn't have time to change.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.999
I had to come straight from work.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.999
- You got a job.
- I know. Grown up, right?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.915
What do you do?

13:08.916 --> 13:12.499
It's pretty wild, I'm a data
processor for a credit card company.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.182
- Which one?
- X-Cred.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.849
Any chance you can
increase my student limit?

13:19.333 --> 13:21.624
Yeah, you're the third person
to crack that joke tonight.

13:21.625 --> 13:22.957
- Was it funny the first time?
- No.

13:22.958 --> 13:24.040
All right. OK.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.099
Note to self, gotta
work on my chat.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.515
Pathetic. It's like
watching a little boy.

13:33.708 --> 13:35.557
Come on, let's fuck off.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.307
Want a hit, boys?

13:46.833 --> 13:48.040
Let's do it.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.457
Sausage fest, mate.

13:49.458 --> 13:52.124
You'll just get stoned and talk
shit with a bunch of crusties.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.290
Girls out here. Dick soup in here.

13:54.291 --> 13:57.249
So my cousin, he graduated
from Newcastle with a first.

13:57.250 --> 14:02.040
He applied to every law firm in the country
with roughly 6,000 applicants per job.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.332
He now works in a bar.

14:03.333 --> 14:08.040
Fuckin' same story everywhere.
So how did you land the X-Cred gig?

14:08.041 --> 14:10.040
My dad used to work there.

14:10.041 --> 14:12.040
Anyway, what about you?

14:12.041 --> 14:16.582
I've seen you and your friends around uni,
with your designer clothes and your cash.

14:16.583 --> 14:19.832
One of my friends said she bought a
stereo from one of your housemates

14:19.833 --> 14:22.165
and there was boxes piled high.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.515
You're very suspicious.

14:25.208 --> 14:26.957
What do you guys do?

14:26.958 --> 14:28.640
We're entrepreneurs.

14:29.541 --> 14:31.290
What kind?

14:31.291 --> 14:32.974
Trade secret.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.874
You're a lucky fucker, Yatesey.

14:36.875 --> 14:39.332
Luck's got nothing to
do with it, Daniel.

14:39.333 --> 14:42.140
What kind of a twat goes
all in on two pair?

14:42.333 --> 14:46.165
Who wants to come and share this
with me? You're not invited, cunty.

14:46.166 --> 14:48.807
I'm crying on the inside. Honestly.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.599
- Should we go?
- Yeah.

14:59.958 --> 15:01.557
Fiona.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.682
Nice one.

15:13.541 --> 15:16.599
Whoa, better.

15:28.458 --> 15:30.807
Can three people play?

15:42.875 --> 15:45.082
Frankie, we're leaving.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.890
OK, one minute.

15:47.166 --> 15:49.915
- That's me.
- Then I'd better get your number.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.849
I'd like to see you again.

15:51.916 --> 15:54.140
You better give me
your phone, then.

16:07.958 --> 16:09.957
This is your email address.

16:09.958 --> 16:12.599
I don't want to make
it too easy for you.

16:12.708 --> 16:14.557
Good night, Sam.

16:19.041 --> 16:21.349
Did you get what's-her
-name's number last night?

16:21.791 --> 16:23.807
She gave me her email address.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.582
That's a bit gay.

16:26.583 --> 16:29.582
Yeah. You know where she works?

16:29.583 --> 16:32.207
No, I wasn't the one
talking to her all night.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.849
X-Cred.

16:33.916 --> 16:35.890
She's a data processor.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.724
Fuck.

16:39.583 --> 16:40.999
Mate, she could be a gold mine.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.557
Probably, but I'm not
interested in her for that.

16:45.041 --> 16:46.932
I like her.

16:47.375 --> 16:50.724
There's just something
about her. Quality.

16:51.458 --> 16:54.649
I think it's that
she's fucking fit.

16:57.541 --> 17:00.307
- Right.
- Break a leg.

17:19.375 --> 17:21.082
- Mr Barker?
- Yes, mate.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.848
Sign here please, guv,
you've got a package.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.848
Open it up, Mr Ford.

17:27.790 --> 17:29.640
Looks like it's all here.

17:47.291 --> 17:50.265
Come on in. We've been waiting.

17:57.791 --> 18:00.207
As a statement of intent

18:00.208 --> 18:03.499
there's nothing quite
like forced nudity,

18:03.500 --> 18:06.749
gaffer tape and hired thugs.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.457
Cuts out the time-wasting questions

18:09.458 --> 18:13.557
that usually go hand in
hand with these situations.

18:15.250 --> 18:18.015
I don't think you've
met my friend Harry.

18:19.125 --> 18:21.057
They have.

18:21.125 --> 18:25.432
Now Harry here is
good with numbers.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.457
A fucking genius.

18:27.458 --> 18:31.682
But like many brilliant
men he has a weakness.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.624
He loves to pay for women.

18:34.625 --> 18:38.874
I keep telling him, "Spend
some money, get a nice girl".

18:38.875 --> 18:42.374
But he never listens.
He likes them cheap.

18:42.375 --> 18:45.999
Fucks them on street corners
or in the back of his car.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.057
Now I'm not here to cast judgement.
His cock, his business.

18:53.333 --> 18:59.624
What does concern me is that last
night he was carrying something

18:59.625 --> 19:01.165
that belonged to me.

19:01.166 --> 19:04.290
Something sensitive.

19:04.291 --> 19:08.790
There are files on here,
business accounts,

19:08.791 --> 19:12.890
that I can't risk falling
into the wrong hands.

19:13.583 --> 19:16.790
I keep telling Harry to be careful.

19:16.791 --> 19:19.540
I shouldn't have to but I still do.

19:19.541 --> 19:22.999
But I know he is weak
so I take precautions.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.915
His phones, his laptop, this tablet
here, all infected with spyware.

19:29.916 --> 19:35.457
I can locate them whenever I choose,
operate cameras via remote,

19:35.458 --> 19:37.932
listen to what is being said...

19:45.250 --> 19:47.307
Tariq, take over.

19:48.708 --> 19:52.290
English, fuckhead! How many
times do I have to say it?

19:52.291 --> 19:53.832
Speak English.

19:53.833 --> 19:55.515
Sorry, boss.

19:57.208 --> 20:02.307
My builder, my cleaner, now even
my fucking heavies are Polish.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.807
Half the price, twice the nuisance.

20:10.166 --> 20:12.707
That's enough. Any more
and you'll kill him.

20:12.708 --> 20:14.390
So?

20:14.541 --> 20:17.915
So I don't need a dead body,
I need an accountant.

20:17.916 --> 20:20.515
I value profit over corpses.

20:23.416 --> 20:28.140
I had to cut short my daughter's
birthday party to deal with this.

20:28.208 --> 20:32.957
I'm a busy man and I value time
with my family above all else.

20:32.958 --> 20:37.932
So you four are going to
have to make it up to me.

20:38.375 --> 20:42.040
While we've been waiting, I've had a
chance to look over your operation.

20:42.041 --> 20:47.057
Credit cards, blackmail, identity
fraud. Quite impressive.

20:48.375 --> 20:50.640
I'll make you a deal.

20:51.875 --> 20:55.790
This is a list of things I want.

20:55.791 --> 20:59.015
Things you are going to get for me.

20:59.625 --> 21:04.599
You complete this list by,
let's say, 5:00 p.m.,

21:04.666 --> 21:07.140
and deliver the goods to me.

21:13.791 --> 21:15.082
It's a lot.

21:15.083 --> 21:17.015
There's no way you can...

21:20.041 --> 21:25.207
Think of it as a challenge. If you
succeed, maybe I forgive you.

21:25.208 --> 21:29.057
If you fail, you get a
visit from these two.

21:30.541 --> 21:32.682
Pick him up, let's go.

21:48.250 --> 21:51.332
They were here when we got back.
They came out of nowhere.

21:51.333 --> 21:54.207
Sorry, what the fuck
did you guys do?

21:54.208 --> 21:56.415
Nothing you haven't done
a hundred times yourself!

21:56.416 --> 21:58.474
I kind of doubt that.

22:00.250 --> 22:04.599
It's a long list. We're gonna need nearly
all the plastic we've got stockpiled.

22:05.041 --> 22:07.265
So we're doing this, then?

22:07.458 --> 22:10.890
We collect the list, we get him off
our back. There's no other play.

22:12.250 --> 22:13.849
Yeah.

23:08.833 --> 23:09.999
Speak.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.932
We've got the gear.
Where do you want it?

23:33.041 --> 23:37.140
All of it in one day.
Very enterprising.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.832
How much do you think it's worth?

23:39.833 --> 23:41.707
I've no idea.

23:41.708 --> 23:43.790
Take a guess.

23:43.791 --> 23:45.624
£50,000? £60,000?

23:45.625 --> 23:47.557
So,

23:48.958 --> 23:53.665
if I said you owe me
200,000 a week every week

23:53.666 --> 23:56.457
that would be fair?

23:56.458 --> 23:58.390
Gives them time off
for the weekends.

24:00.875 --> 24:06.807
Look... You asked us to do something.
We did it. End of story.

24:08.750 --> 24:11.582
For someone that knows credit
card companies that well,

24:11.583 --> 24:14.707
I'm surprised you don't know
how they make their money.

24:14.708 --> 24:17.100
You have a debt.
Interest is incurred.

24:17.101 --> 24:20.432
You've paid the interest.
The debt still stands.

24:21.916 --> 24:24.499
But this'll happen every
time we make a delivery.

24:24.500 --> 24:28.582
Debt never touched. Doesn't
seem very reasonable.

24:28.583 --> 24:33.224
Everything you've seen of me
up until now is reasonable.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.724
Out there in the darkness,
that's unreasonable.

24:42.833 --> 24:47.849
You pay me my money, every week for
as long as you can. The day you can't...

24:56.333 --> 25:00.415
Now, I am prepared to
make it easy for you.

25:00.416 --> 25:04.832
If you can't convert plastic to cash,
I can take merchandise off your hands.

25:04.833 --> 25:07.807
Jewellery, electronics, drugs...

25:11.000 --> 25:12.890
How much?

25:13.625 --> 25:16.390
To pay off the debt and
make you walk away?

25:19.666 --> 25:22.724
- You won't like it.
- Probably not.

25:24.875 --> 25:30.307
Two million pays off your
debt, buys my forgiveness.

25:40.375 --> 25:41.499
OK.

25:41.500 --> 25:45.224
One condition, you pay in two
weeks. All of it. No exceptions.

25:46.125 --> 25:47.707
Two million. Two weeks.

25:47.708 --> 25:51.890
And that time frame is inflexible.
I must be clear about that.

25:51.958 --> 25:56.265
Personally, if I was you, I'd stick
with the weekly payment plan.

25:58.791 --> 26:02.307
The balls on this one!
Doesn't give an inch.

26:02.666 --> 26:07.140
Well, good luck.
See you in two weeks.

26:08.250 --> 26:10.640
I'm rooting for you!

26:12.783 --> 26:14.457
Keys.

26:14.458 --> 26:15.624
What?

26:15.625 --> 26:19.457
The keys to your van. How
else do we transport goods?

26:19.458 --> 26:21.265
Fuck's sake.

26:22.708 --> 26:26.057
Congratulations,
you're all walking home.

26:28.125 --> 26:30.582
You should have consulted us.

26:30.583 --> 26:33.415
He did. You lot didn't have
the balls to make a decision.

26:33.416 --> 26:34.957
What, and like he made a good one?

26:34.958 --> 26:36.832
It was the only option.
You know that.

26:36.833 --> 26:39.082
Sooner or later we would
have fallen behind.

26:39.083 --> 26:41.124
At least this way
there's a finish line.

26:41.125 --> 26:42.582
Two weeks and he's
out of our lives.

26:42.583 --> 26:44.665
- Or we'll be dead.
- Either way, it'll be over.

26:44.666 --> 26:47.540
What? Doesn't make it any better!

26:47.541 --> 26:50.099
This way we've got
room to manoeuvre.

26:50.958 --> 26:55.390
Surely it's impossible to make
£2,000,000 in two weeks.

26:56.041 --> 26:59.432
We need more cards.
Bigger spenders.

26:59.791 --> 27:04.182
How do we build up the spending profiles
when we're flying blind for this long?

27:05.333 --> 27:08.099
There's only one way to do it.

27:08.166 --> 27:10.765
We need an inside man.

27:11.250 --> 27:13.249
I know who we need.

27:13.250 --> 27:14.499
No.

27:14.500 --> 27:19.265
Look, I don't want to do it either.
We don't have a choice.

27:19.916 --> 27:23.474
Are you two gonna tell me what
the fuck you're talking about?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.182
Make a decision.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.599
Thank you.

27:36.833 --> 27:42.015
OK, remember Frankie? She's a
data processor with X-Cred.

27:44.583 --> 27:45.915
So, what are you doing?

27:45.916 --> 27:48.349
I'll start by hacking her email.

27:49.583 --> 27:52.457
- Can you do that?
- It's Webmail. Please.

27:52.458 --> 27:54.707
All right, mate.
So, what's the point?

27:54.708 --> 27:56.692
Most people have something
in life they want bad enough

27:56.693 --> 27:58.957
that they'd break
the law to get it.

27:58.958 --> 28:02.165
We just need to find out
what it is and exploit it.

28:02.166 --> 28:04.624
- This is bollocks.
- Worked on you.

28:04.625 --> 28:07.374
What's that supposed to
mean, it worked on me?

28:07.375 --> 28:09.124
You hacked my fucking email?

28:09.125 --> 28:11.290
Yep. And Rafa's.

28:11.291 --> 28:12.890
What?

28:13.041 --> 28:14.624
You knew about this?

28:14.625 --> 28:16.082
I picked you both out.

28:16.083 --> 28:17.832
What gives you the right to
go through our personal shit?

28:17.833 --> 28:19.999
You work part time for The News
of the World, or something!

28:20.000 --> 28:22.874
I haven't heard too many complaints
over the last year. It made you rich.

28:22.875 --> 28:26.540
You doubled my student loan, mate. It
ain't exactly buying me a Ferrari, is it?

28:26.541 --> 28:29.082
How things started
shouldn't matter.

28:29.083 --> 28:31.640
How they end, that's
what's important, right?

28:32.500 --> 28:33.957
To be continued.

28:33.958 --> 28:36.224
Fucking right.

28:37.833 --> 28:40.099
Find anything?

28:40.250 --> 28:42.307
Think so, yeah.

28:43.833 --> 28:46.640
Reckon you can make that work?

28:46.833 --> 28:48.540
Really?

28:48.541 --> 28:50.599
Hey, Dad.

28:50.708 --> 28:51.874
How you feeling?

28:51.875 --> 28:54.582
X-Cred has said he's
in breach of contract.

28:54.583 --> 28:58.165
They say he should have informed
them sooner about his illness.

28:58.166 --> 29:00.749
They're refusing to pay medical
costs. We can't afford the hospice.

29:00.750 --> 29:03.015
He'll have to go back on the ward.

29:03.416 --> 29:06.499
So he can die with people around
him, coughing and snoring.

29:06.500 --> 29:09.432
Mum, doesn't he
deserve some dignity?

29:16.791 --> 29:19.557
No way... Frankie?

29:19.583 --> 29:21.665
Sam. What are you doing here?

29:21.666 --> 29:25.832
Stalking you of course. I've been in
that bush for the last two hours.

29:25.833 --> 29:28.082
Bloody hell. Doesn't
look very comfortable.

29:28.083 --> 29:32.557
Yeah, tell me about it. I was just
trying to walk off the cramp. Busted.

29:34.750 --> 29:38.849
Nah, I'm just passing through.
Tell me you're not on your way home.

29:40.833 --> 29:42.765
Home.

29:43.333 --> 29:46.474
What would I have to do to get
you to come out for a drink?

29:48.166 --> 29:50.057
Cheer me up.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.765
I needed that.

29:57.375 --> 29:59.624
I'm glad I bumped into you.

29:59.625 --> 30:02.207
Do you believe in fate?

30:02.208 --> 30:04.849
And now you've ruined it.

30:05.833 --> 30:07.832
It was only a matter of time.

30:07.833 --> 30:09.807
Yeah.

30:11.375 --> 30:13.390
Thank you.

30:14.041 --> 30:16.015
I'll get this.

30:16.125 --> 30:19.290
- We can split it, if you like.
- No, no. It's on me.

30:19.291 --> 30:20.915
- Thanks.
- One condition.

30:20.916 --> 30:23.765
You forget about that fate line.

30:23.791 --> 30:25.765
Deal.

30:29.375 --> 30:32.724
You got a secret trust
fund or something?

30:32.791 --> 30:36.390
- I wish.
- Well, how'd you get a black card, then?

30:37.791 --> 30:40.682
You asked me how I make money.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.515
Take a look.

30:44.916 --> 30:46.915
It says Charles Burnett on this.

30:46.916 --> 30:50.182
And tomorrow it'll be someone else.

30:50.375 --> 30:52.374
You're a thief?

30:52.375 --> 30:54.474
An opportunist.

30:56.458 --> 30:58.665
Don't you want to know why I do it?

30:58.666 --> 31:01.932
No, not really.

31:02.250 --> 31:05.849
Medical bills. That's
how it started...

31:07.375 --> 31:11.474
My brother. He got sick.
About as bad as it gets.

31:12.083 --> 31:15.499
The doctor said he was terminal.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.915
I didn't agree.

31:16.916 --> 31:20.515
Private treatments,
mostly in America.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.790
And the costs soon stacked up.

31:22.791 --> 31:27.640
I couldn't afford to pay the bills so I
had to figure out a way that I could.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.415
I knew it wasn't right

31:31.416 --> 31:36.332
but if me risking everything gave my
brother another week, shit, another day,

31:36.333 --> 31:38.624
of course I was gonna do it.

31:38.625 --> 31:41.599
Fuck whoever told me otherwise.

31:42.875 --> 31:46.349
It turned out the first
doctor was right.

31:46.541 --> 31:49.224
Dad's not even a
human being to them.

31:49.250 --> 31:51.599
He's a statistic.

31:51.791 --> 31:55.890
A set of figures that no
longer work in their favour.

31:57.958 --> 32:00.349
I can't do this, Sam.

32:02.541 --> 32:04.515
Why not?

32:04.666 --> 32:07.040
Because stealing from the
company which you work for,

32:07.041 --> 32:10.349
whatever way you look
at it, is wrong.

32:10.750 --> 32:12.790
There's no such thing
as victimless crime.

32:12.791 --> 32:14.332
Someone always has to suffer.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.290
The best way to justify it to yourself
is to find someone that deserves to.

32:17.291 --> 32:21.390
And it seems to me that your
company deserve it more than most.

32:23.958 --> 32:26.265
How does it work?

32:29.291 --> 32:31.707
I'm sure I'm telling you
what you already know,

32:31.708 --> 32:33.790
but credit cards operate
on smart neural networks

32:33.791 --> 32:35.915
so they can spot spending patterns.

32:35.916 --> 32:39.249
That's why we try to build up
a profile for each cardholder.

32:39.250 --> 32:42.749
We can access the electoral register,
hack their computer, steal their mail.

32:42.750 --> 32:47.349
Then we buy expensive items with
the cloned cards and sell it on.

32:47.750 --> 32:48.915
How much can we make?

32:48.916 --> 32:52.182
With you on the inside? No limit.

32:54.916 --> 32:56.415
These are good.

32:56.416 --> 32:58.749
With Frankie on board we'll have
access to the personal details

32:58.750 --> 33:01.249
of every client in
the X-Cred database.

33:01.250 --> 33:04.665
I'm gonna get everything you need
to clone some big-hitting cards.

33:04.666 --> 33:06.832
Frankie's finding us
overseas customers,

33:06.833 --> 33:09.457
we'll go where they spend and
staying within spending patterns.

33:09.458 --> 33:11.124
Why abroad? Why not in London?

33:11.125 --> 33:14.124
Because the customers I deal
with are based here, in the UK.

33:14.125 --> 33:18.432
Right. So use another country's accounts
to avoid being suspected. That's smart.

33:18.708 --> 33:21.015
Got to cover my tracks.

33:22.833 --> 33:25.182
So where we going?

34:29.125 --> 34:33.748
Five cards. All linked to big spenders who
hit Miami at least three times a year.

34:33.750 --> 34:36.248
Combined credit on the cards is
three and a half million dollars.

34:36.250 --> 34:38.706
Fucking hell. Who are these people?

34:38.708 --> 34:41.333
But if you boys wanna go out,
hit the town? That's fine by me,

34:41.335 --> 34:45.040
but stick to cash. These cards
are strictly for the job in hand.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.290
My personal advice would
be to keep a low profile.

34:47.291 --> 34:49.456
First up, Yannick Kieffer.

34:49.458 --> 34:52.998
A banker from Luxembourg in
town selling bearer bonds.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.831
Credit card limit, $500,000.

34:55.833 --> 34:57.999
And we are aiming to take
him for every penny.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.082
What if he's out shopping
at the same time as us?

35:00.083 --> 35:02.832
Won't they notice two
different card transactions?

35:02.833 --> 35:05.932
Of course they will. That's why
we've got to keep an eye on him.

35:14.750 --> 35:17.582
Could you hold the doors, please?

35:17.583 --> 35:20.582
Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.

35:20.583 --> 35:23.040
Y'all having a good day?

35:23.041 --> 35:26.182
Couldn't press nine
for me, could you?

35:28.666 --> 35:30.432
Thank you, sir.

35:31.416 --> 35:34.932
We've got him on GPS. He's
heading for his suite now.

35:35.041 --> 35:37.082
Let's get spending.

35:37.083 --> 35:40.099
Is that the top of your range?

35:44.875 --> 35:46.557
It's a difficult choice.

35:52.833 --> 35:54.874
What'd he say to you?

35:54.875 --> 35:56.332
What?

35:56.333 --> 35:58.140
Sam.

35:58.375 --> 36:02.332
When he first made contact.
How'd he get you to join the team?

36:02.333 --> 36:05.499
He promised me a
Ferrari inside a year.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.390
Oh, yeah?

36:07.958 --> 36:11.515
And how'd he know
that's what you wanted?

36:12.250 --> 36:15.724
You reckon that's the laptop
they used to hack your email?

36:16.791 --> 36:19.724
These aren't your friends, Raf.

36:20.750 --> 36:23.908
- Yeah.
- Group's getting bigger.

36:23.909 --> 36:28.415
Our shares are getting smaller.
This whole Marcel thing...

36:28.416 --> 36:32.582
doesn't really inspire long term
prospects for this crew, does it?

36:33.708 --> 36:35.832
What are you saying?

36:35.833 --> 36:39.932
I'm saying everyone has
a price. A magic number.

36:41.666 --> 36:45.307
When you've figured out what
yours is, you let me know.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.457
Thanks.

36:51.458 --> 36:53.265
Cheers.

36:54.958 --> 36:57.249
You think they're going to be OK?

36:57.250 --> 37:00.765
They're good at looking
out for themselves.

37:04.333 --> 37:07.557
How long have you known Sam?

37:07.916 --> 37:09.790
About a year.

37:09.791 --> 37:13.640
He came to me like he came to you,
"Join up and I'll make you rich."

37:15.375 --> 37:18.582
Yeah, he makes a convincing
argument, right?

37:18.583 --> 37:22.307
He likes you. Do you know that?

37:22.500 --> 37:24.790
Yeah.

37:24.791 --> 37:27.015
Yeah, I think so.

37:28.375 --> 37:31.057
And how about you?

37:32.541 --> 37:34.515
Not sure.

37:36.958 --> 37:38.707
Come here. I want
to tell you a secret.

37:38.708 --> 37:42.290
What do you mean "a secret"?
A secret about what?

37:42.291 --> 37:44.540
I can't, actually. It's really bad.

37:44.541 --> 37:48.082
What do you mean "bad"? Oh,
come on. You have to tell me now.

37:48.083 --> 37:49.749
Come here, then, and I'll tell you.

37:49.750 --> 37:51.682
Go on. What?

38:00.333 --> 38:03.332
You only did that because
I'm right in front of you.

38:03.333 --> 38:05.415
You seemed pretty
keen at the party.

38:05.416 --> 38:09.515
Yeah, I was, until you
walked off mid-sentence.

38:09.583 --> 38:12.224
I'm not walking off now.

38:18.916 --> 38:21.957
You think he's all that he seems?

38:21.958 --> 38:23.290
- Sam?
- Hmm.

38:23.291 --> 38:27.415
Come off it. We've all got dirt
on us, Yatesey. I'm not so naive.

38:27.416 --> 38:30.349
You fucking look the part.

38:32.166 --> 38:34.974
I thought we were playing nice.

38:35.500 --> 38:38.224
I don't need your shit, Yatesey.

38:38.291 --> 38:41.682
I know exactly what
you need, Frankie.

38:42.291 --> 38:44.182
Yeah.

38:44.708 --> 38:47.265
Yeah, I do.

38:49.083 --> 38:52.540
But not from you when
you're on something?

38:52.541 --> 38:53.915
- Want some?
- Cocaine?

38:53.916 --> 38:55.807
- Yeah.
- No.

39:26.458 --> 39:27.540
He's on the move.

39:27.541 --> 39:30.057
All right. Almost done.

39:33.416 --> 39:35.265
Parfait.

39:36.250 --> 39:37.849
Sir.

39:44.541 --> 39:45.957
We did good today.

39:45.958 --> 39:48.707
Yeah. Couldn't have done
it without you, Frankie.

39:48.708 --> 39:52.807
That stuff's like stocking fillers
compared to this outfit. Look.

39:53.375 --> 39:56.957
Gets pretty boring just watching
an orange dot all day long

39:56.958 --> 40:00.999
I searched, "Miami" and
"jewellery" and "exclusive"

40:01.000 --> 40:02.749
and it was the first
thing that came up.

40:02.750 --> 40:06.707
Before or after you logged out of
Youporn? I'm just trying to work it out.

40:06.708 --> 40:10.974
After. Your sister was
doing a private cam show.

40:11.625 --> 40:13.165
Ow.

40:13.166 --> 40:15.165
Ama Dablam jewellers...

40:15.166 --> 40:18.540
That's a $400,000
brooch, right there.

40:18.541 --> 40:21.040
They've got this new, like,
coloured diamond collection.

40:21.041 --> 40:25.124
But none of the cards have a history of
spending there. It won't fit the profile.

40:25.125 --> 40:27.390
It's a shame.

40:27.791 --> 40:29.540
Right. If that's us done,
I'm hitting the town.

40:29.541 --> 40:30.624
What?

40:30.625 --> 40:33.457
- Uh, I don't think that's a good idea.
- You can do what you like.

40:33.458 --> 40:37.540
We're in Miami, I'm having a mad one
and that's all there is to it, mate.

40:37.541 --> 40:41.207
What about you, Raf? Champagne
and strippers or mini bar and a wank?

40:41.208 --> 40:43.624
Uh... The first one?

40:43.625 --> 40:45.807
Thought so, mate.

40:46.916 --> 40:48.890
Oh, wanker, wanker.

40:50.166 --> 40:51.790
Hold on.

40:51.791 --> 40:56.390
Look. If they're gonna work hard
you've gotta let 'em play a bit.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.474
I'll make sure they come
back in one piece, yeah?

40:59.833 --> 41:01.974
All right.

41:03.833 --> 41:06.057
Hold on, dickheads!

41:08.916 --> 41:10.832
You know, you should
watch out for him.

41:10.833 --> 41:12.290
Who?

41:12.291 --> 41:13.790
You know who.

41:13.791 --> 41:16.974
Yatesey? Most girls love him.

41:18.166 --> 41:20.224
Not this one.

41:24.583 --> 41:25.749
You all right, babe?

41:25.750 --> 41:26.932
Fuck off.

41:51.333 --> 41:55.040
Champagne! And none of
that cheap Krug shit, either.

41:55.041 --> 41:57.765
Something to impress these hookers.

41:58.791 --> 42:00.749
I'm a dancer, not a hooker.

42:00.750 --> 42:02.474
We'll see.

42:07.541 --> 42:09.432
You cold?

42:09.791 --> 42:11.890
Yeah, a little.

42:17.833 --> 42:20.624
I can't believe I'm here.
It's insane.

42:20.625 --> 42:24.957
So, would you have given me your number
if you knew you'd be out here doing this?

42:24.958 --> 42:27.749
Well, I didn't actually
give you my number, did I?

42:27.750 --> 42:31.849
All right, your email address.
You know what I mean.

42:32.208 --> 42:34.807
I'd probably have
told you to get lost.

42:36.166 --> 42:38.707
I'm glad you didn't.

42:38.708 --> 42:41.057
Yeah, me too.

42:41.625 --> 42:44.932
The funny thing is I could
actually get used to this.

42:46.291 --> 42:49.040
What? Drinking in public places?

42:49.041 --> 42:51.165
This is what homeless
people do every day.

42:51.166 --> 42:54.749
Frankie, you should set your
sights a little higher.

42:54.750 --> 42:56.499
What are you talking about?

42:56.500 --> 42:57.790
I know, I'm rambling.

42:57.791 --> 43:01.890
- You're completely rambling.
- Yeah, I know.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.640
- Talking shit, a little.
- Total bollocks.

43:09.166 --> 43:11.932
You going to kiss me already?

44:45.125 --> 44:47.349
We need more fizz.

44:47.416 --> 44:48.665
I'm broke.

44:48.666 --> 44:50.082
Fordy?

44:50.083 --> 44:52.140
I'm brassic.

44:52.166 --> 44:53.807
Fuck's sake.

44:55.291 --> 44:58.682
Go get us another two
bottles of Cristal.

44:58.916 --> 45:00.499
Oi, Yatesey, what are you doing?

45:00.500 --> 45:02.432
Fuck off.

45:02.666 --> 45:04.790
Yates, that's one
of the big hitters.

45:04.791 --> 45:08.974
Then I'm sure he can afford a
bottle of champagne or two.

45:10.625 --> 45:12.582
I can't believe you
took that card off Sam.

45:12.583 --> 45:17.224
Sam? That's his name on
the fucking card, is it?

45:24.833 --> 45:26.665
Where's the booze?

45:26.666 --> 45:31.582
The card was refused. They,
like, kept it, or whatever.

45:31.583 --> 45:33.582
They fucking what?

45:33.583 --> 45:35.415
OK, time to go.

45:35.416 --> 45:37.749
OK, gentlemen. We need
to have a word with you.

45:37.750 --> 45:40.015
Ah, mate. I've forgotten...

45:41.083 --> 45:43.457
Come on, you guys!
Out the back, quick!

45:43.458 --> 45:44.540
Oh, fuck!

45:44.541 --> 45:46.140
Go! Go!

45:48.083 --> 45:49.499
Rafa! Rafa!

45:49.500 --> 45:52.182
Don't follow me!

45:52.416 --> 45:54.307
Don't follow me! Fuck off!

45:54.791 --> 45:56.724
Yatesey!

46:03.166 --> 46:04.540
Back off!

46:04.541 --> 46:06.207
Come back here!

46:06.208 --> 46:09.474
I'll get you! You motherfucker!

46:12.458 --> 46:14.224
Fuck!

46:22.958 --> 46:24.807
Fuck you!

46:25.041 --> 46:26.290
Fuck me!

46:26.291 --> 46:28.307
Let's go! Let's go!

46:38.291 --> 46:39.457
Hello?

46:39.458 --> 46:42.515
Sam, it's me. We need to talk.

46:47.833 --> 46:49.932
Well? What is it?

46:50.333 --> 46:52.349
There's been a...

46:53.250 --> 46:55.682
There's been an incident, mate.

46:57.583 --> 46:58.957
OK?

46:58.958 --> 47:01.224
Yatesey took one of the cards.

47:01.500 --> 47:03.474
Which one?

47:04.875 --> 47:06.624
I thought it would be OK.

47:06.625 --> 47:09.332
No, Yatesey, you
didn't think at all.

47:09.333 --> 47:10.540
Come on. Give it back.

47:10.541 --> 47:13.349
They kept it. It got declined.

47:13.708 --> 47:16.807
What did I say?
What did I fucking say?

47:17.041 --> 47:19.390
These cards were strictly
for the job in hand.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.582
No, no, no. For fuck's sake!

47:28.583 --> 47:29.999
What is it?

47:30.000 --> 47:32.057
We've lost Max de Beer.

47:35.958 --> 47:37.165
How much?

47:37.166 --> 47:39.724
That card was worth one
and a half million.

47:40.041 --> 47:42.171
- Where the hell were you?
- Strip club.

47:42.172 --> 47:44.290
Clearly you haven't
read the fucking brief!

47:44.291 --> 47:47.332
Max de Beer is gay.
He doesn't do strip clubs.

47:47.333 --> 47:50.724
Not much of a tits and ass
man, if you catch my drift.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.515
Kind of half is, surely?

47:54.416 --> 47:56.107
Not so much the tits.

47:59.458 --> 48:02.624
That's really clever, Rafa.
That's really fucking clever.

48:02.625 --> 48:05.582
If you're so fucking clever, why do
I have to break it down for you?

48:05.583 --> 48:07.915
Three and a half million minus
one and a half, equals two!

48:07.916 --> 48:11.082
$2,000,000. We owe
Marcel £2,000,000.

48:11.083 --> 48:13.849
Maybe now you can see
the fucking problem!

48:17.083 --> 48:18.415
What do we tell Frankie?

48:18.416 --> 48:22.124
You're asking the wrong question, Fordy.
"What are we gonna tell Marcel?"

48:22.125 --> 48:25.024
That should be the only thing
on your mind right now.

48:44.375 --> 48:45.832
You look stressed?

48:45.833 --> 48:48.432
- Rafa's got an idea, mate.
- Here we go.

48:48.458 --> 48:52.624
You might think I only rate a petrol
station, but I'm smarter than you know.

48:52.625 --> 48:54.557
OK, let's hear it.

48:55.041 --> 48:56.749
We hunt the big fish.

48:56.750 --> 48:59.349
Order up what we owe
Marcel and much more.

48:59.916 --> 49:01.890
We go after Ama Dablam.

49:05.541 --> 49:07.665
Something like this could
set us up for life.

49:07.666 --> 49:10.207
Except none of the cards we've got
have any history spending there.

49:10.208 --> 49:12.290
We don't need a credit
card to get what we want.

49:12.291 --> 49:13.874
We need this guy.

49:13.875 --> 49:15.474
Right?

49:15.708 --> 49:17.082
What am I looking at?

49:17.083 --> 49:18.957
Prince Zafran of Brunei.

49:18.958 --> 49:22.890
It's not a bad match, mate.
I reckon we can pull it off.

49:22.958 --> 49:26.374
OK, so you get me out to Miami,
you lose our biggest card

49:26.375 --> 49:29.207
now you want me to help you rob the
most exclusive jewellers in town?

49:29.208 --> 49:31.124
That sounds like a great idea.

49:31.125 --> 49:33.540
Yeah, it sounds bad
when you put it like that.

49:33.541 --> 49:37.582
I just don't see the point. You know, we
have plenty of money on the remaining cards,

49:37.583 --> 49:40.187
- why bother with this?
- We don't even need you.

49:40.188 --> 49:42.624
You're lucky we even
agreed to cut you in.

49:42.625 --> 49:46.207
Lucky? Any day I wake up and I'm
not you, believe me, I feel lucky.

49:46.208 --> 49:47.332
Oh, shut up.

49:47.333 --> 49:50.040
Look, this is once in a lifetime
shit we're talking about.

49:50.041 --> 49:53.040
We get this right, there's no
jobs at companies we despise,

49:53.041 --> 49:55.624
no 8% unemployment,

49:55.625 --> 49:59.832
no carpet-bombing CVs for postgraduate
jobs that don't even fucking exist.

49:59.833 --> 50:02.415
This could be all of
us set up for life.

50:02.416 --> 50:05.432
What I'm asking for is
you listen to the plan.

50:08.041 --> 50:09.415
OK.

50:09.416 --> 50:11.290
Prince Zafran's young
and uber-rich.

50:11.291 --> 50:14.790
It says here he's about
to pop the question

50:14.791 --> 50:18.165
to some French super-model
called Natascha Claudet.

50:18.166 --> 50:19.624
Now what do you reckon Ama
Dablam are gonna think

50:19.625 --> 50:22.307
if he starts enquiring
about jewellery?

50:22.958 --> 50:24.874
That they might get the
engagement ring contract.

50:24.875 --> 50:28.040
We get them on the hook and
we get them over to London.

50:28.041 --> 50:31.307
We're gonna take them for $20
million without even using a gun.

50:33.416 --> 50:35.624
How much is it gonna
cost to set up?

50:35.625 --> 50:37.515
It's big money.

50:37.791 --> 50:40.057
So let the plastic take the hit.

50:41.166 --> 50:43.557
OK, so this is the room you wanted.

50:43.625 --> 50:45.224
Yep.

50:47.166 --> 50:50.724
It's not much, but it's mine,
so don't fuck it up. Comprende?

50:52.875 --> 50:56.249
Mustafa Riald, the prince's
private secretary.

50:56.250 --> 50:57.890
You got a number?

50:57.958 --> 50:59.640
Right here.

50:59.750 --> 51:01.932
What are we waiting for?

51:08.375 --> 51:10.249
Hello, Mr Riald's office?

51:10.250 --> 51:14.457
Hello. I'm calling from Ama Dablam
jewellers in Miami, Florida.

51:14.458 --> 51:16.499
May I speak with Mr Riald?

51:16.500 --> 51:18.957
I'm afraid Mr Riald is
travelling at the moment.

51:18.958 --> 51:21.249
As you know, we're one of
the world's leading jewellers,

51:21.250 --> 51:23.749
and as the imminent engagement
of Prince Zafran...

51:23.750 --> 51:25.249
I should stop you right there, sir.

51:25.250 --> 51:26.874
The engagement is pure speculation.

51:26.875 --> 51:28.790
It's a secret, I get it.

51:28.791 --> 51:30.665
But we would like to
arrange a private viewing

51:30.666 --> 51:32.749
of our latest coloured diamond
collection for the prince.

51:32.750 --> 51:33.915
Sorry, did you say you that

51:33.916 --> 51:35.707
you were one of the world's
leading jewellers?

51:35.708 --> 51:37.540
That's correct. Clients such as...

51:37.541 --> 51:39.707
Sir, if there is to
be a royal wedding,

51:39.708 --> 51:41.807
only the best jeweller
would be required.

51:42.125 --> 51:44.957
Perhaps Mr Riald is in a better
position to make that decision.

51:44.958 --> 51:46.124
When's he back?

51:46.125 --> 51:47.957
Possibly this Saturday,
but he could...

51:47.958 --> 51:49.890
I'll call back then, thank you.

51:50.958 --> 51:55.265
Right, Riald's not in Brunei and his
P.A. won't connect anyone to him.

51:55.291 --> 51:57.932
- And that's good?
- That is good.

52:00.250 --> 52:01.457
Have you an image?

52:01.458 --> 52:03.099
Yeah, picture's up.

52:03.208 --> 52:05.515
All right, Yatesey, do the fan.

52:12.791 --> 52:15.540
Good morning, Ama Dablam.
How may I direct your call?

52:15.541 --> 52:18.624
I would like to speak to
Head of International Sales.

52:18.625 --> 52:20.249
Certainly, sir. Your name?

52:20.250 --> 52:25.290
Mustafa Riald, private secretary to His
Excellency, Prince Zafran of Brunei.

52:25.291 --> 52:27.557
Just putting you through now, sir.

52:40.041 --> 52:41.415
This is Steve Dawson.

52:41.416 --> 52:44.665
Mr Dawson, I wonder if you
could be of assistance.

52:44.666 --> 52:46.290
Sir, I can barely hear you.

52:46.291 --> 52:50.849
Apologies. I am speaking from
satellite phone on the Royal Jet.

52:52.041 --> 52:53.457
How can I help you, sir?

52:53.458 --> 52:57.849
Do you know that Prince Zafran will
be announcing his engagement shortly?

52:57.916 --> 53:01.807
- No, no. I did not know that.
- Good.

53:02.125 --> 53:05.707
It is confidential. I assume
your discretion is assured?

53:05.708 --> 53:07.999
Our business is built
on trust, sir.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.457
That is why we have
chosen Ama Dablam

53:09.458 --> 53:11.749
for His Royal Highness to
consider an engagement gift

53:11.750 --> 53:14.765
and perhaps even the wedding rings.

53:16.500 --> 53:20.599
Sir, it would be an honour.
Any piece in particular?

53:20.750 --> 53:24.765
We expect a private viewing of your
recent coloured diamond collection.

53:24.791 --> 53:26.832
Of course. Are you in Miami?

53:26.833 --> 53:30.374
No. We will shortly be in
London for a two day visit.

53:30.375 --> 53:33.207
We would like to arrange
a private viewing there.

53:33.208 --> 53:36.290
The Royal Jet and staff
will be at your disposal.

53:36.291 --> 53:38.665
Well, the thing is, Mr Riald...

53:38.666 --> 53:43.682
If it's a problem we would
consider another jeweller.

53:44.041 --> 53:45.557
I'll make it happen.

53:47.458 --> 53:51.932
Very good. I will call you tomorrow morning
at 8:00 a.m. and arrange everything.

54:17.500 --> 54:19.582
- Hi there.
- Can I help you?

54:19.583 --> 54:22.249
Is this baby available
for charter to London?

54:22.250 --> 54:24.807
She can go to Iraq if
the money's right.

54:25.041 --> 54:27.832
We promised him the Royal
Jet. We'll need staff.

54:27.833 --> 54:28.999
So, find them.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.749
And do us all a favour. This is
the modelling capital of America.

54:31.750 --> 54:32.832
So?

54:32.833 --> 54:35.599
So make sure they're not dogs.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.582
I, uh, like what I see.

54:42.583 --> 54:44.557
And you like what you touch.

54:44.875 --> 54:48.182
I guarantee they give happy ending!

54:48.541 --> 54:50.457
Yeah.

54:50.458 --> 54:55.724
Uh, I just need them to be hostesses.
You know, polite, smile, not say too much.

54:55.791 --> 54:57.890
And, uh,

54:58.958 --> 55:03.640
it's quite important they
don't do happy endings.

55:06.791 --> 55:09.665
OK, we got his jet and the staff.

55:09.666 --> 55:11.999
Now we need authentic
costumes and decor.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.332
Uh, I should probably do that guys.

55:14.333 --> 55:16.665
I'm writing my dissertation
on Middle Eastern culture.

55:16.666 --> 55:20.349
Middle Eastern? Brunei's next
to Malaysia, you bell end.

55:31.833 --> 55:33.790
We'll need transport
back in London.

55:33.791 --> 55:36.390
- Needs to be fit for a prince.
- I'm on it.

55:42.125 --> 55:46.224
Looks like I'm in line for a big
commish from the Brunei royal family.

55:46.750 --> 55:48.207
Doing a showing in London shortly.

55:48.208 --> 55:51.599
London? Wow, I'd love to go there.

55:52.416 --> 55:55.682
Well, maybe we could
arrange an extra seat?

55:56.000 --> 55:59.540
Get you out of accounts and onto
the front line with the big dogs.

55:59.541 --> 56:01.307
You can do that for me?

56:02.166 --> 56:05.599
Yeah. A pretty face
never hurt a sale.

56:31.208 --> 56:33.807
Sam, how's Miami?

56:35.041 --> 56:36.457
How'd you get this number?

56:36.458 --> 56:39.415
You think I wouldn't keep
an eye on my investment?

56:39.416 --> 56:41.890
So what are you doing out there?

56:42.250 --> 56:46.765
I hope you're not thinking of running
away from your responsibilities.

56:47.333 --> 56:49.557
I'm working on a way
to get your money.

56:51.416 --> 56:53.540
How is the water?

56:53.541 --> 56:56.349
Well, make sure you work hard.

56:56.375 --> 56:59.807
I'd hate for anything to
happen to your new girlfriend.

56:59.875 --> 57:03.390
Tariq tells me she
is quite beautiful.

57:03.458 --> 57:05.557
Did she enjoy her swim?

57:18.416 --> 57:21.515
Sam, hey! This is Tariq.
Tariq, this is Sam.

57:23.041 --> 57:24.207
You OK?

57:24.208 --> 57:27.124
Yeah, fine. Tariq's over from London.
He wanted to know what's good to eat.

57:27.125 --> 57:29.374
I was telling him about
that burger place.

57:29.375 --> 57:33.640
I want to know where is best place
in Miami to find a good restaurant.

57:34.625 --> 57:38.765
I could ask anyone on the
beach, but I choose her.

57:39.458 --> 57:42.140
She is a very beautiful lady.

57:44.666 --> 57:48.057
If I cut her face, maybe
not so much, huh?

57:48.375 --> 57:50.707
Doesn't bother me,
I can fuck her from behind.

57:50.708 --> 57:52.790
This is best position
for me anyway.

57:52.791 --> 57:54.290
Put the fucking razor down.

57:54.291 --> 57:56.057
Fuck you!

57:57.541 --> 58:01.807
I want you to give my friend Sam a
reminder from his friend Marcel.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.874
Tell Sam if he doesn't get
Marcel his money in three days,

58:05.875 --> 58:07.707
very bad things will happen.

58:07.708 --> 58:09.582
Not just to him,

58:09.583 --> 58:12.182
but to the people he cares about.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.099
Can you remember all that? Huh?

58:17.708 --> 58:20.515
I see you soon. Huh?

58:21.333 --> 58:23.349
You fucking scumbag.

58:23.916 --> 58:25.749
- Frankie...
- Don't touch me!

58:25.750 --> 58:28.265
- Where are you going?
- To get some answers.

58:35.958 --> 58:38.390
So how much do you owe him?

58:38.666 --> 58:40.624
- What?
- Marcel.

58:40.625 --> 58:42.040
How much money do you owe him?

58:42.041 --> 58:44.249
Sam's told me everything,
but I want to hear it from you.

58:44.250 --> 58:47.140
How much money do you owe to him?

58:47.708 --> 58:50.682
- It's a couple of hundred...
- Two million.

58:55.583 --> 58:57.224
Who is he?

58:58.375 --> 58:59.915
Who the fuck is he?

58:59.916 --> 59:01.890
Frankie, we don't know.

59:02.916 --> 59:05.015
OK, that's the truth.

59:05.166 --> 59:08.999
All we know is he's dangerous
and he wants his money.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.974
Why do you owe him money?

59:11.000 --> 59:12.665
Because we fucked up.

59:12.666 --> 59:14.832
You told her about Marcel?

59:14.833 --> 59:16.124
I haven't said anything.

59:16.125 --> 59:17.582
She said you did.

59:17.583 --> 59:19.682
You fell for that?

59:23.750 --> 59:26.515
You recruited me to
pay off your debt?

59:28.416 --> 59:30.332
Is that what I am to you, Sam?

59:30.333 --> 59:32.724
That's all anyone
is to him, Frankie.

59:33.875 --> 59:37.682
Don't feel special. He did
the same to me and Raf.

59:40.916 --> 59:42.457
Did what?

59:42.458 --> 59:44.290
Ever wondered why Prince Charming

59:44.291 --> 59:47.432
always seems to know exactly
what you're thinking?

59:47.791 --> 59:51.890
"Oh, he's so sensitive.
He just gets me."

59:54.791 --> 59:56.707
They hacked your email.

59:56.708 --> 59:58.432
That's what they do.

59:58.583 --> 01:00:00.290
How did you put it, Sam?

01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:03.307
You needed to find something
you could exploit?

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.807
I'm guessing it was
something juicy.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:10.390
You gonna tell us
what it was, Frankie?

01:00:12.583 --> 01:00:15.182
Maybe he's just got
a really big cock.

01:00:18.958 --> 01:00:20.832
- Frankie?
- Fuck off, Sam!

01:00:20.833 --> 01:00:23.015
Aw, the one that got away.

01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:25.182
Come here, you fucking prick!

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:30.874
Sam!

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:33.374
You dug your own fucking hole, Sam!

01:00:33.375 --> 01:00:35.015
Back it up.

01:00:36.416 --> 01:00:37.749
Calm the fuck down!

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:40.474
- This isn't over.
- Yeah, count on it.

01:00:41.625 --> 01:00:43.265
Cunt.

01:00:43.416 --> 01:00:45.057
Fucking nice one!

01:00:48.458 --> 01:00:50.890
Frankie, come on.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.932
Please, I just want to talk
to you. Let me explain.

01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:58.790
Frankie, wait. Where are you going?

01:00:58.791 --> 01:01:01.640
- To catch a flight.
- Please, don't go.

01:01:01.666 --> 01:01:04.349
He said you needed
something to exploit.

01:01:04.583 --> 01:01:06.307
What did you find?

01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:10.182
My dad, wasn't it?

01:01:12.166 --> 01:01:13.999
And that story about
your brother...

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.474
I made it up. Fuck.

01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:19.057
What kind of a person
does that, Sam?

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:23.165
Frankie, I liked you way before any
of this stuff ever happened...

01:01:23.166 --> 01:01:25.349
Fuck you!

01:01:27.166 --> 01:01:28.957
Frankie, for what it's
worth, I'm sorry.

01:01:28.958 --> 01:01:32.057
No, it's not worth anything.

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:34.082
Yatesey!

01:01:34.083 --> 01:01:35.665
Sam, calm down.

01:01:35.666 --> 01:01:36.915
- Where is he?
- Calm the fuck down.

01:01:36.916 --> 01:01:40.390
- Where the fuck is he?
- Calm down! OK? Calm.

01:01:41.041 --> 01:01:44.307
OK, look, I'm sorry. OK?
Really fucking sorry.

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:46.640
I am, about all of this.

01:01:46.958 --> 01:01:49.499
But we've got a bigger
problems right now. Yeah?

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.707
Yatesey's a prick. OK?

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.540
Shown his true colours and after
this, we drop him like a stone.

01:01:54.541 --> 01:01:56.724
But right now, we need him.

01:01:57.958 --> 01:02:00.099
OK, Frankie can wait, mate.

01:02:00.875 --> 01:02:02.599
Marcel won't.

01:02:05.333 --> 01:02:07.265
OK?

01:02:25.458 --> 01:02:27.457
Hello, Mr Riald's office.

01:02:27.458 --> 01:02:30.207
Hi, there, this is Steve
Dawson from Ama Dablam.

01:02:30.208 --> 01:02:32.374
I'm afraid he's very
busy at the moment.

01:02:32.375 --> 01:02:35.957
I'll bet he's real busy with the
engagement of the prince, right?

01:02:35.958 --> 01:02:38.557
As you say, sir.
I'll have him call you back.

01:02:40.583 --> 01:02:42.849
Really?

01:02:42.916 --> 01:02:46.474
Well, it would be an honour
to be invited to the wedding.

01:02:47.333 --> 01:02:50.557
Well, yes, I do have someone
I'd like to bring along.

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:53.307
Yeah. Well, thank you.

01:02:53.333 --> 01:02:56.349
Listen, he can call me
back. OK? Yeah.

01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:00.457
You're invited to the wedding?

01:03:00.458 --> 01:03:02.390
Wanna come?

01:03:03.208 --> 01:03:04.974
I wanna come.

01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:08.390
Right. Hurry up
before he shags her.

01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:14.999
I have Mr Riald on
the line for you.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.999
Riald? Yeah, put him through.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.374
Mr Riald, thank you so
much for calling back.

01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:21.124
Good afternoon.

01:03:21.125 --> 01:03:24.640
As you know, I am very
busy, so I must be brief.

01:03:24.875 --> 01:03:29.349
I am just letting you know that the Royal
Jet is waiting to take you to London.

01:03:29.625 --> 01:03:32.707
We're grateful that the Brunei
security services will be present,

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:37.890
but our insurers insist on our
own team accompanying us.

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:42.124
We'll be bringing some beautiful
additions to the current collection,

01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:46.474
including a choke necklace and bracelet
made from yellow and black diamonds.

01:03:46.583 --> 01:03:48.432
Truly spectacular.

01:04:00.666 --> 01:04:03.724
Excuse me, do you have any nuts?

01:04:04.583 --> 01:04:06.582
You know, nuts? Nuts.

01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:08.474
You understand?

01:04:18.416 --> 01:04:20.849
OK. Let's roll.

01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:29.540
They're at the hotel. There's one steel
case strapped to a security guy.

01:05:29.541 --> 01:05:32.957
I'll put in my call now
before they can relax.

01:05:32.958 --> 01:05:37.349
Hey, we've got a couple of
hours before the meeting.

01:05:38.583 --> 01:05:40.499
Do you wanna grab a drink?

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.682
Well, I was gonna
have a shower but...

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:46.582
- A drink sounds good.
- A shower sounds better.

01:05:46.583 --> 01:05:48.849
Yeah, it does.

01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:55.374
What? Are you playing games?

01:05:55.375 --> 01:05:57.724
I just said I was
gonna have a shower.

01:05:59.041 --> 01:06:01.849
Which means I'll be naked.

01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:04.765
Who's playing games?

01:06:06.041 --> 01:06:07.640
That's great.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.124
Hello?

01:06:16.125 --> 01:06:17.499
Mr Dawson?

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:18.790
Mr Riald.

01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:21.499
I trust your flight was acceptable?

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:25.390
Uh, yeah. Yeah, the flight
was great. Thank you.

01:06:26.333 --> 01:06:28.999
Thank you so much for laying
on the special entertainment.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.057
It was really appreciated.

01:06:31.333 --> 01:06:32.540
OK.

01:06:32.541 --> 01:06:35.582
His Royal Highness' diary
has dramatically changed,

01:06:35.583 --> 01:06:37.249
so we need to bring
forward the schedule.

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:39.724
Meet you in the foyer
in 30 minutes.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.724
Thirty minutes. Game face.

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:53.515
Mr Riald?

01:06:54.333 --> 01:06:56.707
Mr Dawson. Good to meet you.

01:06:56.708 --> 01:07:00.765
You too. This is Beth
Johnson, my assistant.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.999
And this is my security attachment.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.082
Very good.

01:07:04.083 --> 01:07:06.207
His Excellency is on a
tight schedule today.

01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:09.599
So, can I speed things up and
get the viewing under way?

01:07:23.083 --> 01:07:25.707
Your Excellency, the Ama
Dablam team is here.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.890
This is Steve Dawson.

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:30.182
Your Royal Highness...

01:07:31.333 --> 01:07:33.807
It's a real privilege
to meet you, sir.

01:07:38.666 --> 01:07:42.640
I should like to view the collection
on the way to my next meeting.

01:07:44.791 --> 01:07:48.349
His Excellency would appreciate
a private, advance viewing.

01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:51.099
In the limo?

01:07:51.541 --> 01:07:54.932
I say "appreciate", it's
more that he insists on it.

01:07:58.208 --> 01:07:59.932
Of course, not a problem.

01:08:00.291 --> 01:08:01.832
Give His Royal Highness
the case, please.

01:08:01.833 --> 01:08:05.474
I will be riding up front, you and
your team can ride in car two.

01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:08.499
You're handing over the
collection without an escort?

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.082
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
That will be all.

01:08:11.083 --> 01:08:13.890
- But that goes against...
- Beth, go to your room.

01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:20.332
Steve, you can't do this.

01:08:20.332 --> 01:08:23.099
Don't ever question me in
front of my client again, OK?

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:25.540
This is the way the
prince likes it.

01:08:25.541 --> 01:08:29.974
That's why I'm head of International Sales
and you're just a glorified secretary.

01:08:31.166 --> 01:08:32.765
Fucking prick.

01:08:40.332 --> 01:08:43.540
We will return the case at the
prince's next appointment.

01:08:43.541 --> 01:08:45.640
I'm going to be late.

01:09:51.416 --> 01:09:53.557
Wait for it, Fordy. Now!

01:10:01.708 --> 01:10:05.082
- What the hell? Stay with the limo!
- I can't, sir. It's a red light.

01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:07.190
Get out! Come on, move, move.

01:10:17.883 --> 01:10:18.790
Hello.

01:10:18.791 --> 01:10:22.082
Rafa in limo one's left us.
Limo two, where are you?

01:10:22.083 --> 01:10:23.249
Yatesey?

01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:26.390
Limo two with you in five seconds.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.599
Come on!

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.474
Come on, come on.

01:10:39.041 --> 01:10:41.599
- We're good to go.
- OK, let's go. Come on!

01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:07.057
- Looks like they bought it.
- Keep it nice and slow.

01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:12.474
For a minute there I thought
we were being robbed.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.599
Time?

01:11:24.958 --> 01:11:26.557
Time.

01:11:30.416 --> 01:11:33.057
Ta-ta, fuckers.

01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:38.082
Where the hell is Riald going?

01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:39.374
Which way do you
want me to go, sir?

01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:41.040
- With the diamonds!
- Sir?

01:11:41.041 --> 01:11:43.557
The fucking limo, idiot!

01:11:50.416 --> 01:11:52.624
Oh, no. Bollocks.

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:57.432
- Is there a problem, sir?
- No. I need you to pull over.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.624
Is there anything I can do, sir?

01:12:01.625 --> 01:12:03.457
Can I borrow your
phone please, mate?

01:12:03.458 --> 01:12:05.057
You what?

01:12:05.125 --> 01:12:07.790
I command that you surrender
your mobile phone.

01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:09.602
I need to make urgent call.

01:12:09.603 --> 01:12:12.124
- Royal business.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:12.125 --> 01:12:15.124
- It's a UK call, right?
- Yes.

01:12:15.125 --> 01:12:17.432
Yes. And private.

01:12:28.125 --> 01:12:31.807
- Hello?
- It's me. My battery died.

01:12:32.291 --> 01:12:35.474
- I worked it out.
- What?

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:40.307
Your magic number.
How does 10 million sound?

01:12:40.375 --> 01:12:43.307
- What are you talking about?
- Two way split.

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:47.765
Got a guy waiting to take this stuff
off our hands. It's all been arranged.

01:12:48.875 --> 01:12:50.332
I don't think I can, mate.

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:53.557
What did I tell you about letting
people take the piss out of you?

01:12:54.416 --> 01:12:56.640
It's time to step up, Rafa.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.974
I'm ready to give you
what you're worth.

01:13:00.791 --> 01:13:02.849
Yatesey...

01:13:15.166 --> 01:13:18.599
I have decided to walk to my
next meeting. This is yours.

01:13:18.708 --> 01:13:21.165
- Shall I drive those cases to...
- No, no. Not necessary.

01:13:21.166 --> 01:13:23.890
You are finished for the day.

01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:36.765
The fuck...

01:13:38.166 --> 01:13:39.807
Jesus, what the hell?

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:50.665
Come on! Move.
Get out of the car!

01:13:50.666 --> 01:13:52.682
Get out of the fucking...

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:55.432
Come on, move.
Come on, come on, please.

01:14:03.666 --> 01:14:06.624
OK, what the fuck
is this? Look again!

01:14:06.625 --> 01:14:09.015
Look the fuck again.

01:14:13.166 --> 01:14:16.432
Oh, God damn it!

01:14:17.541 --> 01:14:19.974
Oh, fuck, fuck.

01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:31.890
Oh, here we go.

01:14:32.458 --> 01:14:35.457
- Yatesey, everything all right?
- All good.

01:14:35.458 --> 01:14:37.290
- Where's Rafa?
- He's with me.

01:14:37.291 --> 01:14:40.874
- I thought we were meeting up after...
- Yeah well, you know what thought did.

01:14:40.875 --> 01:14:43.207
We're just calling to say goodbye.

01:14:43.208 --> 01:14:45.499
- You've got the diamonds?
- Not for long.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.790
I've got a buyer lined
up and ready to go.

01:14:47.791 --> 01:14:50.499
- What is going on?
- What about Marcel?

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.099
Your problem. Goodbye, Sam.

01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:55.224
He's done it, hasn't he?

01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:57.099
Fuck!

01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:03.015
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:09.665
Our statement from you,
"A prince and his royal secretary

01:15:09.666 --> 01:15:14.165
"just stole $20 million
worth of jewels

01:15:14.166 --> 01:15:15.874
"without using any force."

01:15:15.875 --> 01:15:19.674
- Did you gift-wrap it for them?
- Excuse me?

01:15:19.675 --> 01:15:21.915
The jewellery. Did you
have it gift-wrapped?

01:15:21.916 --> 01:15:23.599
Cos you might as well have done.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.840
- Are we suspects?
- Of course not, Beth.

01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:31.307
We're in charge now,
thank you, Mr Dawson.

01:15:34.916 --> 01:15:37.265
What do we tell Marcel?

01:15:39.166 --> 01:15:41.165
Maybe he'll give us an extension.

01:15:41.166 --> 01:15:43.599
Not if we're talking about
the same bloke, we're not.

01:15:55.875 --> 01:15:56.999
What's that?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.724
Do you think I'd trust
Rafa with $20 million?

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.432
How else do we keep an eye on them?

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.599
Good call.

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:16.849
Right, he's heading east.

01:16:25.958 --> 01:16:27.832
Marie de Guise Hotel, Park Lane.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.682
OK, well that's ten
minutes away from here.

01:16:36.708 --> 01:16:38.249
Yatesey reckons he's
already found a buyer.

01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:39.790
Mate, with that amount
of money at stake

01:16:39.791 --> 01:16:42.307
he'll have to bring some
serious muscle to the table.

01:16:42.583 --> 01:16:45.640
Right. I know just the guy.

01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:50.707
Sam, we were just
talking about you.

01:16:50.708 --> 01:16:54.349
- Yeah, what?
- Do you have my money in your hands?

01:16:54.541 --> 01:16:58.640
Yeah, well about that...
We might need an extension.

01:16:58.833 --> 01:17:00.540
- Speak.
- Sam? Sam, it's me...

01:17:00.541 --> 01:17:02.182
Frankie?

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.582
It was Tariq's idea to pick her up.

01:17:04.583 --> 01:17:07.457
I think he's got a bit
of a crush on her.

01:17:07.458 --> 01:17:10.665
If you consider that he got his last
two girlfriend's hooked on drugs

01:17:10.666 --> 01:17:14.874
and working as prostitutes,
you might realise this isn't

01:17:14.875 --> 01:17:18.390
the ideal relationship
for her to be in.

01:17:18.541 --> 01:17:21.849
I want my money. Today.

01:17:22.333 --> 01:17:24.790
Any later, I give Frankie to Tariq.

01:17:24.791 --> 01:17:28.807
And when he's done with her, he comes
looking for you and for your friends.

01:17:31.333 --> 01:17:33.124
We'll get you your money.

01:17:33.125 --> 01:17:36.707
It's amazing what a little extra
motivation can do, isn't it?

01:17:36.708 --> 01:17:39.474
Now, tell me, where can
I collect my money?

01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:45.140
Obviously you checked into the
validity of this Riald character?

01:17:45.375 --> 01:17:46.974
Yeah.

01:17:47.291 --> 01:17:49.332
Well, yeah. Kind of.

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:53.374
What he's asking is, did you ever call
Brunei and speak directly to Riald?

01:17:53.375 --> 01:17:57.057
Of course he did. We were
invited to the wedding.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.765
Busted.

01:18:03.125 --> 01:18:05.957
- You're pathetic.
- He knows.

01:18:05.958 --> 01:18:07.640
Am I going to lose my job?

01:18:08.333 --> 01:18:10.665
- What?
- The prince used my phone.

01:18:10.666 --> 01:18:12.207
"Royal business," he said.

01:18:12.208 --> 01:18:14.332
Do you have any idea who
it could have been?

01:18:14.333 --> 01:18:17.224
No, but the number is still here.

01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:32.890
- You sure about this?
- These guys respect me, Rafa.

01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:36.057
They run a cash business.
It's perfect.

01:18:57.791 --> 01:19:00.540
Hello, you're talking
to a millionaire.

01:19:00.541 --> 01:19:01.915
You reckon I won't find you?

01:19:01.916 --> 01:19:05.849
- I'm counting on it.
- You're not as clever as you think.

01:19:10.458 --> 01:19:13.432
Sit down with the stuff. Sit down.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.724
Mr Yates. Meet my boss.

01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:26.182
- Only name he goes by is Mr X.
- Good to finally meet you. Come in.

01:19:45.375 --> 01:19:46.974
They're here.

01:19:49.875 --> 01:19:51.932
Any problem, you call me.

01:20:03.875 --> 01:20:05.474
What the...

01:20:07.166 --> 01:20:08.765
Come here!

01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:14.515
- Where is she? Where is she?
- She...

01:20:15.041 --> 01:20:16.890
She's in the boot.

01:20:19.375 --> 01:20:20.974
Stay there.

01:20:35.125 --> 01:20:36.724
It's OK.

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:38.040
It's OK.

01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:40.515
I just want to get the
fuck out of here.

01:20:41.083 --> 01:20:44.165
Please. I'm only an accountant.

01:20:44.166 --> 01:20:45.849
Give me your phone.

01:20:48.833 --> 01:20:50.432
And your jacket, now.

01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:03.057
All right, go. Go.

01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:08.290
Frankie, we have to finish this.

01:21:08.291 --> 01:21:11.890
I can't protect you. I'm sorry.

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.099
Frankie, run.

01:21:20.541 --> 01:21:22.140
Go!

01:21:31.375 --> 01:21:35.124
Nice. Very nice.

01:21:35.125 --> 01:21:37.332
That's just the tip
of the iceberg, bruv.

01:21:37.333 --> 01:21:39.974
Dion tells me you're pulling
in half a million cash a week.

01:21:40.416 --> 01:21:42.915
That means I've got enough
stuff for three month's wages.

01:21:42.916 --> 01:21:46.390
- I'd like to see it.
- I see the money, you see the stuff.

01:21:47.083 --> 01:21:48.682
He wasn't asking.

01:21:50.958 --> 01:21:52.374
What the fuck?

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:55.890
You're out of your depth,
Mr Yates. There's no shame in it.

01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:59.207
Should I remind you that there are
cameras in the lobby and the lifts?

01:21:59.208 --> 01:22:04.140
Only if you want me to tell you we
came in the back and took the stairs.

01:22:09.041 --> 01:22:10.499
Fuck!

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.682
Don't worry, it's a
.22. Only little.

01:22:13.958 --> 01:22:16.124
Fuck's sake, Yatesey, just
give them what they want!

01:22:16.125 --> 01:22:20.015
- Shut up, Rafa.
- My fucking leg!

01:22:24.416 --> 01:22:26.549
Last chance.

01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:30.224
Stop.

01:22:36.583 --> 01:22:38.807
He's not going to tell us anything.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.182
Not with a gun in
that idiot's mouth.

01:22:53.583 --> 01:22:57.557
Now you and me, we're
kindred spirits.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.974
You know what I see in your eyes?

01:23:01.291 --> 01:23:05.265
Nothing. It's like
looking in the mirror.

01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:14.349
You expecting someone?

01:23:17.916 --> 01:23:19.515
Well, then answer the door.

01:23:19.958 --> 01:23:23.140
And if it's anyone other than an old
lady wanting to change the sheets,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.474
I'm gonna ventilate your head.

01:23:44.250 --> 01:23:45.849
You gonna invite us in?

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:09.765
Yatesey!

01:24:43.125 --> 01:24:46.707
Triangulation puts them at Marie
de Guise Hotel, Park Lane.

01:24:46.708 --> 01:24:48.307
Call for backup.

01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:07.640
Yeah?

01:25:50.833 --> 01:25:54.415
DCI Hartley, ambulance required
at the Marie de Guise Hotel now.

01:25:54.416 --> 01:25:56.707
Shots are being fired.

01:25:56.708 --> 01:25:59.249
Clear everybody out!
Get out, go, go!

01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:01.224
We've got to wait for backup.

01:26:45.208 --> 01:26:46.807
Yatesey!

01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:51.849
Where's the backup?

01:27:16.708 --> 01:27:18.307
Stop right there!

01:27:24.916 --> 01:27:27.582
Right, he's on the move. Let's go.

01:27:27.583 --> 01:27:33.515
Yeah. Marcel's here now.
Get down.

01:27:40.333 --> 01:27:41.932
Get us the fuck out of here now!

01:28:17.916 --> 01:28:19.374
Fuck you!

01:28:19.375 --> 01:28:22.290
Armed police! Drop the
gun, right fucking now!

01:28:22.291 --> 01:28:23.890
Hey, fuck you!

01:28:29.708 --> 01:28:31.682
He set me up!

01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:36.207
Soon as we find somewhere
quiet, I want you to pull over.

01:28:36.208 --> 01:28:39.015
I'm going to cut that
fucking bitch's throat.

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:44.249
You sure you know how
to use that thing?

01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:47.015
Looks like one of those point
and shoot models to me.

01:28:52.391 --> 01:28:55.699
Get out! Get out of
the fucking car!

01:28:56.541 --> 01:28:58.849
Get out of the fucking car!

01:28:59.166 --> 01:29:00.665
What are you doing?

01:29:00.666 --> 01:29:02.807
Yatesey, you prick!

01:29:08.166 --> 01:29:09.765
Ow!

01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:14.307
Get off me!

01:29:22.666 --> 01:29:24.265
Yatesey!

01:29:35.791 --> 01:29:40.140
Yatesey! Yatesey!

01:29:54.541 --> 01:29:56.557
Sam?

01:29:58.750 --> 01:30:02.307
Sam! Sam!

01:30:03.666 --> 01:30:05.265
Sam!

01:30:06.333 --> 01:30:07.932
Sam.

01:30:09.166 --> 01:30:12.052
Sam, Sam we need to go. Sam,
we've got to get you out of here.

01:30:12.053 --> 01:30:14.349
- Yatesey's here.
- What?

01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:16.290
He's here, he's got
the fucking diamonds!

01:30:16.291 --> 01:30:18.624
- Check the other car.
- The fucking door's jammed.

01:30:18.625 --> 01:30:21.082
- Fucking check the other car!
- I'm not fucking leaving you here.

01:30:21.083 --> 01:30:22.290
You have to try and get out.

01:30:22.291 --> 01:30:24.832
Fordy, I'm not gonna
fucking make it, mate. Go!

01:30:24.833 --> 01:30:26.832
Go, go!

01:30:26.833 --> 01:30:29.807
Fuck. Fuck!

01:30:30.208 --> 01:30:31.807
Go!

01:30:32.875 --> 01:30:34.474
Fuck!

01:30:47.458 --> 01:30:50.599
Sam! I'm sorry...

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.599
Call an ambulance!

01:31:03.041 --> 01:31:04.640
One casualty...

01:31:23.458 --> 01:31:26.182
Back behind the tape, please!

01:31:31.916 --> 01:31:34.307
I backed the wrong horse.

01:31:38.833 --> 01:31:40.432
Sorry.

01:31:41.625 --> 01:31:45.349
I didn't get that. Say
that again please, over.

01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:51.849
Fuck it.

01:32:34.791 --> 01:32:36.624
Look alive, Rafa.

01:32:36.625 --> 01:32:40.165
Someone's made a dirty
protest in the gent's again.

01:32:40.166 --> 01:32:43.557
It's like a cluster
bomb's gone off in there.

01:32:44.375 --> 01:32:47.207
- Gimme a break. It's your turn.
- No, no, no, my friend.

01:32:47.208 --> 01:32:50.332
I serve the customers, you clean
up what they leave behind.

01:32:50.333 --> 01:32:53.957
You don't like it, I call your parole
officer and tell him you've been stealing.

01:32:53.958 --> 01:32:55.557
Aw.

01:33:02.916 --> 01:33:05.057
- Wanker.
- Oh.

01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:11.415
It just doesn't stop. I didn't get
out of here until 2:00 last night.

01:33:11.416 --> 01:33:13.540
- Before or after you went to the bar?
- I came back.

01:33:13.541 --> 01:33:15.207
- Oh, really?
- You need a little...

01:33:15.208 --> 01:33:18.415
- And Jeremy, how is he?
- Telephone call for you, sir.

01:33:18.416 --> 01:33:20.015
- For me?
- Yes.

01:33:21.083 --> 01:33:22.682
Back in a minute.

01:33:36.916 --> 01:33:39.182
Hey, I didn't ask for...

01:34:03.416 --> 01:34:06.649
Double glazing salesman.
Calls me in a restaurant.

01:34:06.650 --> 01:34:11.124
- How does that even happen?
- Did you buy any?

01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:18.599
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:34:20.708 --> 01:34:22.507
I think so.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.807
Yeah, you done right by her.
That's got to count for something.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.599
Let's go.
