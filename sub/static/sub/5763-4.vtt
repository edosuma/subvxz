00:03.631 --> 00:09.975
?

00:11.677 --> 00:13.522
???

00:13.522 --> 00:14.754
????

00:14.754 --> 00:15.707
??

00:15.707 --> 00:16.879
what ???

00:16.879 --> 00:18.296
I ???

00:18.296 --> 00:21.222
?

00:21.573 --> 00:24.054
hey, can you please stop talking and smile?

00:24.054 --> 00:25.153
oh sorry

00:25.765 --> 00:27.579
huh,???

00:27.855 --> 00:29.822
?

00:29.822 --> 00:31.700
oh??

00:31.700 --> 00:33.533
TO PICK UP SOME REALLY
GREAT PIECES FOR THE SHOP.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.228
IT'S KIND OF SAD

00:35.228 --> 00:36.633
THAT THEY'RE
JUST GONNA SCRAP

00:36.700 --> 00:37.934
THIS GIGANTIC
THING.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.886
YEAH, BUT FIRST THEY'RE
GONNA AUCTION OFF EVERYTHING.

00:39.886 --> 00:42.067
PROMISE ME YOU
WON'T GO OVERBOARD.

00:42.134 --> 00:43.067
YES, YES.

00:43.134 --> 00:44.866
I KNOW WHEN
TO STOP BIDDING. SHUSH.

00:44.866 --> 00:46.400
NO, FOR ONCE,
I'M BEING LITERAL.

00:46.467 --> 00:47.467
I'M TALKING
ABOUT THAT WOMAN

00:47.533 --> 00:49.544
WHO JUMPED OFF
THIS SHIP LAST WEEK.

00:50.034 --> 00:52.167
DON'T YOU GUYS
WATCH THE NEWS?

00:52.233 --> 00:54.725
YEAH. ALL THEY FOUND WERE
HER SHOES BY THE RAILING.

00:54.725 --> 00:56.344
PEOPLE DO THAT
APPARENTLY.

00:56.344 --> 00:58.233
THEY JUST TAKE OFF THEIR
SHOES BEFORE THEY JUMP.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.600
OH, YOU'RE NOT JUST
BEING LITERAL.

00:59.667 --> 01:00.867
YOU'RE BEING KIND OF WEIRD,

01:00.934 --> 01:02.533
AND NO ONE
IS GOING OVERBOARD.

01:03.137 --> 01:04.167
ALL ABOARD!

01:04.233 --> 01:05.167
OOH. OK.

01:05.408 --> 01:07.208
DON'T FORGET
THEY'RE COMING SATURDAY

01:07.208 --> 01:08.925
TO DELIVER THE NEW
FRIDGE FOR THE GARAGE.

01:08.925 --> 01:10.233
I GOT IT. GO.
HAVE FUN.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.333
BYE, D.
BYE.

01:11.802 --> 01:13.949
HAVEN'T TOLD HER
WE'RE TRYING TO GET PREGNANT?

01:13.949 --> 01:15.318
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT

01:15.318 --> 01:16.607
UNTIL THERE'S
SOMETHING TO ANNOUNCE.

01:16.607 --> 01:18.333
BUT YOU KNOW, 3 DAYS,
THE OPEN SEA,

01:18.400 --> 01:19.934
WITH NOTHING ELSE TO DO.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.134
NO AUCTION PREVIEW?

01:21.759 --> 01:23.734
EVERY NOW AND THEN, YOU
HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK.

01:23.800 --> 01:24.967
OH, DO YOU?

01:28.600 --> 01:30.012
OHH.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.853
DID YOUR GHOST-DAR
GO PING?

01:38.233 --> 01:40.088
THERE MAY BE ONE OR...

01:42.533 --> 01:43.467
20.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.034
FINALLY.
SOMEBODY WHO CAN SEE US.

01:46.101 --> 01:48.233
OH, DON'T MIND THEM.
THEY'RE ALL ON EDGE

01:48.300 --> 01:49.867
ABOUT THE SHIP
GOING TO THE BREAKERS,

01:49.934 --> 01:52.467
BUT ALL GOOD PARTIES
HAVE TO END, RIGHT?

01:52.533 --> 01:54.233
WELCOME ABOARD.
I'M BETTY.

01:54.601 --> 01:57.067
UM, MELINDA.

01:57.134 --> 01:58.400
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU?

01:58.467 --> 02:00.366
OH. PHEW. SO SORRY.

02:00.433 --> 02:04.215
I WAS DEAD IN MY STATEROOM
BEFORE THE STEWARD FOUND ME.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.834
BLOOD SETTLED
TO THAT SIDE.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.773
MY ADVICE-IF YOU'RE HAVING
A MASSIVE CORONARY,

02:09.773 --> 02:12.333
DON'T PUT THE "DO NOT
DISTURB" SIGN OUT FIRST.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.230
<i>NOW, COME ON.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THE CLARIDON.</i>

02:15.230 --> 02:16.800
I ALREADY DO.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.366
YOU MAKING FRIENDS
ALREADY?

02:18.433 --> 02:20.733
YEAH, ONE THAT'S
ACTUALLY NICE.

02:21.367 --> 02:23.156
SO YOU'VE BEEN HERE
SINCE THE FIFTIES?

02:23.156 --> 02:24.800
NO. GOD, NO.

02:24.867 --> 02:27.333
'99. I WAS A VINTAGE-CLOTHING DEALER.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.167
SO YOU SAID
YOU'RE IN M-110?

02:29.233 --> 02:30.633
OH,
IT'S A LOVELY ROOM.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.338
AUDREY HEPBURN
ONCE STAYED THERE.

02:32.338 --> 02:33.631
YOU REMIND ME
OF HER.

02:33.631 --> 02:35.292
IT'S JUST UP AHEAD
ON THE RIGHT.

02:35.292 --> 02:36.600
OH, GOD.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.888
NOT NOW, MR. LINARCOS.

02:39.767 --> 02:41.433
LIKE I SAID,
THEY'RE ALL RESTLESS,

02:41.500 --> 02:43.233
WORRIED THAT WHEN
THE SHIP IS DESTROYED,

02:43.300 --> 02:44.734
THEY'LL BE LOST FOREVER.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.700
Woman: WELL, BRIBE THE STEWARD.
I CAN'T STAND OUR ROOM ANYMORE.

02:46.767 --> 02:47.834
AT LEAST YOU CAN
BREATHE IN HERE.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.167
Man: THE SHIP'S
SOLD OUT.

02:49.233 --> 02:51.000
WHOEVER BOOKED THIS ROOM
IS GONNA BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

02:51.067 --> 02:52.000
THEN WE SHOULD HURRY.

02:52.067 --> 02:55.667
UH, HI. I THINK
THIS IS OUR ROOM. HEH.

02:56.253 --> 02:58.034
RIGHT. SORRY.

02:58.330 --> 03:00.033
we were...  just um..

03:00.033 --> 03:01.400
BEING NOSY. HEH.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.101
HI. I'M RICH HENDERSON,

03:04.167 --> 03:07.193
AND THIS IS MY FIANCÉE-
I MEAN-HEH-MY WIFE.

03:07.193 --> 03:10.167
JULIA. IT'S HARD TO TELL,
BUT WE'RE ON OUR HONEYMOON.

03:10.233 --> 03:11.433
AWW.
CONGRATULATIONS.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.037
I- I'M MELINDA, AND THIS
IS MY HUSBAND JIM.

03:14.467 --> 03:16.667
WE'RE IN-IN 108,
RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

03:16.734 --> 03:19.067
OH. HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN HERE
SINCE THE START OF THE TRIP?

03:19.134 --> 03:20.644
SOUTHAMPTON
TO HALIFAX,

03:20.644 --> 03:21.972
AND NOW HERE WE ARE.

03:21.972 --> 03:24.101
RICH'S IDEA.
HE'S SORT OF A SHIP GEEK.

03:24.167 --> 03:27.134
PERSONALLY, YOU CAN'T SCRAP
THE OLD TUB FAST ENOUGH FOR ME.

03:27.201 --> 03:29.867
<i>THE S.S. CLARIDON IS ONE OF
THE LAST TRUE OCEAN LINERS.</i>

03:29.934 --> 03:31.134
AND IF WE DIDN'T
TAKE THIS TRIP NOW-

03:31.201 --> 03:32.931
THEN WE'D BE
ON A BEACH IN MAUl.

03:33.333 --> 03:36.206
I WARN YOU, IF YOUR A.C.
IS ANYTHING LIKE OURS,

03:36.206 --> 03:38.201
KEEP YOUR UNDERWEAR
IN THE MINIBAR.

03:38.876 --> 03:40.281
Rich: SO SORRY.

03:40.281 --> 03:41.500
BON VOYAGE.

03:49.208 --> 03:51.119
OOH, I AM
SO SORRY I'M LATE.

03:51.791 --> 03:54.727
DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE
ARE OVER 55 KINDS

03:54.727 --> 03:56.998
<i>OF EXOTIC WOODS
ON THE S.S. CLARIDON?</i>

03:56.998 --> 03:59.474
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT
THIS FOR THE LAST, UM, HALF AN HOUR.

03:59.474 --> 04:01.311
OH, I SWEAR
I TRIED TO TEXT YOU.

04:01.499 --> 04:04.165
YEAH, CELL SERVICE
IS SO SPOTTY ON THE HIGH SEAS.

04:05.201 --> 04:06.700
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:06.767 --> 04:08.800
WELL, THE SPA WAS A ZOO,

04:08.867 --> 04:11.600
AND THEIR BEST MASSEUR
QUIT IN HALIFAX,

04:11.667 --> 04:16.075
BUT THERE IS STILL TIME FOR A
ROMANTIC STROLL BEFORE DINNER.

04:16.384 --> 04:18.312
DO I HAVE TO WEAR
A PENGUIN SUIT FOR THAT?

04:18.312 --> 04:20.166
NO. FIRST NIGHT, IT'S
JUST JACKET AND TIE,

04:20.166 --> 04:21.879
AND DON'T WORRY, 'CAUSE
YOU WON'T BE IN IT LONG.

04:21.879 --> 04:23.800
OH. SO THERE'S AN UPSIDE.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.300
YOU KNOW, I NEVER TAKE FOR
GRANTED HOW LUCKY WE ARE.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.331
ME EITHER.

04:31.202 --> 04:33.034
OK, WHAT ARE WE
TALKIN' ABOUT HERE?

04:33.101 --> 04:35.433
WELL, I RAN INTO JULIA
AT THE SPA,

04:35.500 --> 04:37.763
AND SHE KEPT APOLOGIZING
FOR TRYING TO STEAL OUR ROOM,

04:37.763 --> 04:41.000
BUT I GUESS THEY'RE HAVING
SOME PROBLEMS, YOU KNOW, IN BED.

04:41.067 --> 04:42.266
OHH. ON THEIR HONEYMOON?
YIKES.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.300
I KNOW. I GUESS EVERY
TIME IT GETS ROMANTIC,

04:44.366 --> 04:45.704
HE FALLS ASLEEP.

04:45.704 --> 04:47.040
THAT'S WHY THEY
WANTED TO SWITCH,

04:47.040 --> 04:48.108
'CAUSE IT WAS TOO HOT.

04:48.108 --> 04:49.881
OR NOT HOT ENOUGH
BY THE LOOKS OF IT.

04:49.881 --> 04:52.433
YOU KNOW,
YOU DO HAVE A SPOOKY KNACK

04:52.500 --> 04:54.400
FOR GETTING PEOPLE
TO OPEN UP TO YOU.

04:54.467 --> 04:56.433
YEAH. EXCEPT USUALLY
IT'S AFTER THEY'VE DIED.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.667
HMM.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.700
OH.

05:02.323 --> 05:04.098
POOR GUY.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

05:04.098 --> 05:05.266
I MEAN, IS HE SICK,

05:05.333 --> 05:07.662
IS IT JUST THE PRESSURE
FROM THE HONEYMOON, OR WHAT?

05:09.271 --> 05:11.433
THERE'S A THIRD OPTION.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.422
Jim: WOW.
A KISSING GHOST.

05:54.674 --> 05:55.625
LITTLE KINKY.

05:55.626 --> 05:56.819
IT'S NOT SEXY.

05:56.819 --> 05:59.180
I MEAN, SHE'S ALL BANGED UP
AND COVERED IN SEAWEED.

05:59.180 --> 06:00.775
WAIT A MINUTE. DO YOU
THINK SHE'S THE WOMAN

06:00.775 --> 06:02.082
THAT DELIA
WAS TALKIN' ABOUT?

06:02.082 --> 06:03.283
IT'S POSSIBLE.

06:03.283 --> 06:05.025
THEN WHY IS SHE
HAUNTING RICH?

06:05.393 --> 06:08.259
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION,
BUT WHATEVER THE ANSWER IS,

06:08.326 --> 06:10.735
WE KNOW WHY THERE ARE NOT
SPARKS FLYING IN THE BEDROOM.

06:10.735 --> 06:12.749
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU
THINK HE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR

06:12.749 --> 06:14.548
WITH THE JUMPER
ON HIS HONEYMOON?

06:14.993 --> 06:17.279
WELL, SHE'S HAUNTING
HIS TONGUE FOR SOME REASON.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.562
GOOD LUCK
BRINGING THAT UP

06:18.562 --> 06:19.645
IN CASUAL CONVERSATION.

06:19.645 --> 06:21.065
ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING
THAT YOU COULD

06:21.065 --> 06:22.792
HANG OUT WITH HIM.
YOU KNOW, GUY TALK.

06:23.074 --> 06:24.886
DO WE HAVE TO
GET INVOLVED IN THIS?

06:25.099 --> 06:27.062
YES. SHE'S A VERY
POWERFUL GHOST,

06:27.062 --> 06:28.642
AND SHE'S PRACTICALLY
FEEDING OFF OF HIM.

06:28.642 --> 06:29.953
BUT YOU SAID
THAT'S WHAT GHOSTS DO,

06:29.953 --> 06:31.637
THEY FEED OFF THE ENERGY
OF THE LIVING.

06:31.637 --> 06:33.318
RIGHT, BUT SHE'S THE REASON
HE'S NOT SLEEPING,

06:33.318 --> 06:35.627
WHICH COULD MAKE THEIR MARRIAGE
END BEFORE IT EVEN STARTED.

06:35.627 --> 06:37.606
OH, HI. AGAIN.

06:37.714 --> 06:41.779
HI. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY
SO-CALLED HUSBAND, HAVE YOU?

06:42.860 --> 06:44.426
UH, Y-

06:44.493 --> 06:45.708
YEAH, HE WAS
ON THE DECK,

06:45.708 --> 06:47.349
TAKING A NAP
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

06:47.349 --> 06:48.724
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

06:49.001 --> 06:50.380
THAT'S THE-

06:50.516 --> 06:51.656
FINALLY.

06:55.049 --> 06:56.620
SORRY. I-
I WAS CHANGING.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.713
NEXT THING I KNOW,
I- I WOKE UP ON DECK.

06:59.259 --> 07:00.993
YOU'RE SLEEPWALKING AGAIN?

07:01.059 --> 07:03.435
RICH, YOU'VE GOTTA GO SEE
THE SHIP'S DOCTOR.

07:03.435 --> 07:05.049
I'LL CALL HER
IN THE MORNING.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.468
WELL,
WE SHOULD, UH-

07:06.468 --> 07:08.099
UH, JOIN YOU,
IF THAT'S OK.

07:08.893 --> 07:10.182
PLEASE.

07:24.800 --> 07:28.747
Rich: AMERICA IS THE LAST HOLDER OF THE BLUE
RIBAND FOR THE FASTEST TRANSATLANTIC CROSSING.

07:28.747 --> 07:30.767
<i>AND THE S.S. UNITED STATES
COULD GO FASTER IN REVERSE</i>

07:30.834 --> 07:33.647
<i>THAN THE CLARIDON
CAN GO FORWARD, EVEN TODAY.</i>

07:33.647 --> 07:35.646
BUT SHE WAS NEVER
BUILT FOR SPEED.

07:35.646 --> 07:39.395
<i>IN FACT, BECAUSE THE CLARIDON WAS THE
LAST 3-STACK LINER EVER BUILT, THE-</i>

07:39.395 --> 07:41.066
RICH, SWEETIE.

07:41.597 --> 07:43.500
OH, I'M SORRY.
ONCE I GET STARTED, I-

07:43.567 --> 07:45.633
NO, IT'S
FASCINATING, REALLY.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.333
Jim: YEAH.
YEAH, IT WAS.

07:54.567 --> 07:56.200
DID YOU GUYS, UM-

07:56.266 --> 07:58.688
WERE YOU ONBOARD, UH,
LAST WEEK? I HEARD A RUMOR

07:58.688 --> 08:00.967
THAT A WOMAN JUMPED
OFF, JUMPED OVERBOARD.

08:00.967 --> 08:04.026
GEORGIA KENT. JUMPED OFF
RIGHT BEFORE WE REACHED HALIFAX.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.433
MOST EXCITEMENT
WE'VE SEEN ON THE SHIP,

08:06.500 --> 08:07.870
NOT TO BE DISRESPECTFUL.

08:07.870 --> 08:09.600
HEH. DID YOU
EVER TALK TO HER?

08:09.667 --> 08:11.576
RICH RAN INTO HER
A COUPLE TIMES.

08:11.576 --> 08:13.047
MMM, JUST IN PASSING,

08:13.047 --> 08:14.825
RESERVING TIME
ON THE SQUASH COURT.

08:14.987 --> 08:17.941
YEAH. HE'S BEEN PLAYIN'
A LOT OF SQUASH.

08:18.837 --> 08:20.694
APPARENTLY DOESN'T
LEAVE A LOT OF ENERGY

08:20.694 --> 08:21.978
FOR OTHER THINGS, BUT...

08:21.978 --> 08:24.200
JIM LOVES SQUASH.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.600
PRACTICALLY ADDICTED,
RIGHT, SWEETHEART?

08:26.950 --> 08:29.333
YEAH. I DO.
THANKS, SWEETHEART.

08:30.153 --> 08:32.332
I GOT A COURT RESERVED
8 A.M. TOMORROW.

08:32.998 --> 08:34.732
ARE YOU READY TO LOSE?

08:34.799 --> 08:36.066
IT'S MY LUCKY DAY.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.714
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE HAVING
A KARAOKE CONTEST

08:38.714 --> 08:40.778
IN THE CLUB INTERNATIONAL.
WHO'S IN?

08:40.778 --> 08:43.368
OH, I-I THINK
WE'RE GONNA TURN IN.

08:43.368 --> 08:45.408
YEAH, I REALLY SHOULD
SAVE ENERGY FOR THE SQUASH.

08:46.042 --> 08:48.575
WELL, I AM GONNA GO TRY
MY BEST RIHANNA.

08:48.642 --> 08:50.413
WE'VE BEEN AVOIDING
OUR CABIN.

08:50.413 --> 08:52.208
IT'S SO HOT AND NOISY
IN THERE.

08:52.275 --> 08:54.775
I THINK WE MUST BE NEAR
A VENTILATION SHAFT.

08:54.842 --> 08:57.308
A LOT OF SCRATCHING AND
BANGING FROM THE ENGINE ROOM.

08:57.375 --> 08:59.108
MORE LIKE SCRATCHING
FROM A RATS' NEST.

08:59.175 --> 09:01.108
AND THE AIR THAT COMES
OUT OF THAT THING IN THE WALL-

09:01.175 --> 09:02.442
PUNKA LOUVRE.

09:02.508 --> 09:03.675
WHATEVER. IT'S CREEPY.

09:03.742 --> 09:06.105
SOUNDS LIKE MOANING FROM-
FROM A WOMAN SINGING.

09:07.408 --> 09:10.609
<i>WELL, THEY SAY
THE CLARIDON IS HAUNTED.</i>

09:10.675 --> 09:12.775
SO THEY SAY. GOOD NIGHT.

09:12.842 --> 09:14.377
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.

09:29.575 --> 09:31.508
CAN YOU GET A MESSAGE
TO MY FAMILY IN QUEENS?

09:31.575 --> 09:34.327
LOOK, MY HUSBAND PROBABLY FOUND SOME
LETTERS. THEY'RE NOT WHAT HE THINKS.

09:34.327 --> 09:35.852
THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME.

09:35.852 --> 09:37.535
I NEED YOU TO TELL
MY BROTHER THOSE WITHDRAWALS

09:37.535 --> 09:39.012
FROM THE COMPANY ACCOUNT
WEREN'T MINE.

09:39.318 --> 09:40.475
OHH!

09:40.542 --> 09:41.742
WHOA.

09:41.809 --> 09:44.740
WE'RE ALL SCARED. SOMETHING
HORRIBLE'S GONNA HAPPEN.

09:44.740 --> 09:46.797
OK, I-IT'S NOTHING BAD.
IT'S JUST-

09:47.328 --> 09:49.327
JUST A CHANGE, OK,
AND I CAN HELP YOU.

09:49.327 --> 09:50.258
MEL.

09:50.258 --> 09:51.891
THEIR HOME IS ABOUT
TO BE DESTROYED,

09:51.891 --> 09:53.465
AND THEY'RE
GETTING STRONGER.

09:53.465 --> 09:56.255
NOW GO. SPREAD THE WORD
AND FOLLOW ME.

09:56.256 --> 09:57.956
SO MUCH
FOR NOTHING TO DO.

10:01.791 --> 10:04.223
WHAT? UH, OH.

10:06.557 --> 10:08.256
SOMEBODY BETTER BE DEAD.

10:08.323 --> 10:10.123
CAREFUL
WHAT YOU WISH FOR.

10:10.190 --> 10:11.806
MELINDA?

10:11.963 --> 10:14.623
WHAT THE HELL?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON A BOAT.

10:14.690 --> 10:16.423
I AM. DO YOU STILL
WANNA LEARN?

10:16.490 --> 10:18.423
NOT AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING.

10:18.490 --> 10:19.757
YEAH, WELL,
IT COMES WITH THE JOB.

10:19.824 --> 10:22.781
I HAVE ABOUT 2 DOZEN
LOST SOULS HERE.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.824
SO WHAT, YOU WANT ME
TO PARACHUTE IN?

10:24.890 --> 10:27.475
NO. JUST LISTEN. GET THEIR
NAMES, THEIR UNFINISHED BUSINESS

10:27.475 --> 10:29.190
AND START RELAYING THE
MESSAGES TO THEIR NEXT OF KIN

10:29.256 --> 10:30.723
AND THEN E-MAIL ME
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

10:30.790 --> 10:33.790
OH. SHIP-TO-SHORE
CROSSOVERS.

10:33.857 --> 10:36.243
I NEED YOUR HELP,
SO GRAB A PEN.

10:37.290 --> 10:40.156
OK, EVERYBODY,
HIS NAME'S ELI.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.723
HE CAN HEAR YOU.

10:43.657 --> 10:45.592
UH, YEAH...

10:46.123 --> 10:48.190
THE NAME'S ROGO.

10:50.223 --> 10:51.403
UM...

10:52.323 --> 10:54.170
HOW DO YOU
SPELL THAT?

11:04.790 --> 11:06.590
I GIVE UP.
YOU WIN.

11:06.657 --> 11:07.590
GOOD GAME.

11:07.657 --> 11:09.123
THANKS.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.523
GLAD IT'S OVER.

11:10.590 --> 11:12.523
IT WAS ROAST-
ROASTING IN HERE.

11:12.590 --> 11:14.123
YEAH.
HEY, HEY, HEY. WAIT.

11:14.190 --> 11:16.156
WHAT'D YOU DO
TO YOUR BACK?

11:18.089 --> 11:19.824
OH. WHAT-WHAT THE HELL?

11:19.890 --> 11:20.924
I- I DON'T KN-

11:20.989 --> 11:22.423
I DON'T-UM...

11:22.757 --> 11:23.956
UH...

11:25.390 --> 11:27.023
I GOTTA HIT
THE SHOWERS.

11:27.089 --> 11:28.323
YEAH. RIGHT.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.102
HEY, UH, EXCUSE ME.

11:32.102 --> 11:34.081
COULD-COULD YOU
HELP ME WIN A BET?

11:34.081 --> 11:35.457
I DON'T KNOW. CAN I?

11:35.523 --> 11:37.623
UM, LOOK, MY BUDDY HERE
SAYS HE PLAYED

11:37.690 --> 11:38.890
EVERY MORNING
OF THE TRANSATLANTIC,

11:38.956 --> 11:40.156
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE HIM.

11:40.223 --> 11:41.790
UH, HIS NAME'S
RICHARD HENDERSON.

11:44.464 --> 11:45.920
HOPE YOU DIDN'T BET MUCH.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.665
HE'S IN EVERY DAY
BRIGHT AND EARLY.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.925
DOESN'T SEEM TO HELP
HIS GAME OUT MUCH, THOUGH.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.523
WAIT A MINUTE. HE PLAYED WITH
THE WOMAN WHO JUMPED OVERBOARD?

11:53.590 --> 11:54.690
EXCUSE ME.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.914
LOOK. RIGHT THERE.

11:56.914 --> 11:58.790
SAME NAME, SAME TIME,
3 DIFFERENT DAYS.

11:58.857 --> 12:00.056
GEORGIA KENT.

12:01.924 --> 12:03.523
I NEVER SAW 'EM
PLAY TOGETHER.

12:04.690 --> 12:07.023
IN FACT, SHE CAME DOWN
AT NIGHT BEFORE DINNER,

12:07.089 --> 12:08.356
USUALLY WITH HER HUSBAND,

12:08.423 --> 12:09.723
BOOKED HER TIME RELIGIOUSLY,

12:09.790 --> 12:12.457
BUT SHE NEVER ONCE
SHOWED UP TO PLAY.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.216
HEY, YOU DIDN'T
HEAR IT FROM ME.

12:14.623 --> 12:15.557
YEAH.

12:15.623 --> 12:17.023
CAN I USE
YOUR PHONE?

12:17.089 --> 12:18.690
SO SHE BOOKED
TIME ON THE COURT

12:18.757 --> 12:20.588
AS A COVER FOR SOME OTHER
SHIPBOARD ACTIVITY?

12:20.588 --> 12:21.603
YEAH.
BUT WAIT A MINUTE.

12:21.603 --> 12:23.478
THE DAY SHE WAS BOOKED,
THE SHIP WAS AT SEA,

12:23.478 --> 12:25.681
SO WHATEVER SHE WAS DOING,
SHE WAS DOING IT ON THE SHIP.

12:25.723 --> 12:27.471
OR YOU MEAN WHOMEVER
SHE WAS DOING.

12:27.471 --> 12:29.484
WELL, RICH WAS
DEFINITELY PLAYING SQUASH,

12:29.484 --> 12:31.983
AND SHE JUMPED BEFORE
THE SHIP DOCKED IN HALIFAX,

12:31.983 --> 12:33.231
SO-

12:34.659 --> 12:35.881
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:35.882 --> 12:37.443
I'LL SEE YOU
UP ON DECK LATER.

12:37.443 --> 12:39.054
I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO THE SPA.

12:39.054 --> 12:40.570
WHAT, ANOTHER MASSAGE?

12:40.570 --> 12:42.535
NOPE. JUST FOLLOWING
A HUNCH.

12:48.890 --> 12:49.924
YOU'RE GOOD.

12:49.989 --> 12:52.364
I SAW HOW YOU HANDLED
THAT SPA ATTENDANT.

12:52.364 --> 12:54.351
SO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT GEORGIA KENT WOMAN...

12:54.351 --> 12:55.673
OH, IT'S SIMPLE MATH,
YOU KNOW.

12:55.673 --> 12:57.336
SHE DISAPPEARED
BEFORE HALIFAX.

12:57.336 --> 12:59.245
THE MASSEUR ABANDONED
SHIP IN HALIFAX.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.053
2 PLUS 2 EQUALS
A TORRID AFFAIR.

13:01.053 --> 13:02.570
AND SO MODEST.

13:02.570 --> 13:03.596
HEY!

13:03.735 --> 13:05.505
DID YOU HEAR THE LATEST?

13:05.505 --> 13:07.238
OUR STEWARD JUST TOLD US
THE CRUISE LINE

13:07.238 --> 13:09.866
RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS PHONE CALL
FROM SOMEBODY ABOARD THE SHIP.

13:09.866 --> 13:11.923
THAT WOMAN WHO SUPPOSEDLY
JUMPED OVERBOARD,

13:11.923 --> 13:13.590
THEY FOUND HER ALIVE,

13:13.657 --> 13:15.818
SHACKED UP WITH
THE SHIP'S MASSEUR IN HALIFAX.

13:15.818 --> 13:17.123
NO KIDDING.

13:17.190 --> 13:18.623
THIS WOMAN LEAVES HER HUSBAND

13:18.690 --> 13:20.123
AND-AND FAKES HER OWN SUICIDE

13:20.190 --> 13:21.879
SO AT LEAST HER HUSBAND
WILL GET THE INSURANCE MONEY.

13:21.879 --> 13:23.494
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE?

13:23.590 --> 13:25.698
HONEY, THEY WERE OUT
OF CRANBERRY J-

13:28.445 --> 13:30.275
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US.

13:30.582 --> 13:31.784
IT'S OK.

13:38.391 --> 13:40.857
LOOK, I CAN HELP YOU,
BUT PLEASE,

13:40.924 --> 13:43.291
IF YOU'RE NOT GEORGIA
KENT, THEN WHO ARE YOU?

13:44.456 --> 13:47.667
HE SWORE HE'D MARRY ME.
HE LIED TO ME.

13:54.664 --> 13:56.564
SO WE RULED OUT
THE JUMPER, HUH?

13:56.631 --> 13:57.631
YEAH, I KNOW,

13:57.698 --> 13:59.798
BUT THIS SHIP IS OLDER
THAN MY GREAT-GRANDMA.

13:59.865 --> 14:01.598
I MEAN, THIS GHOST
COULD BE ANYBODY.

14:01.664 --> 14:03.624
YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T GET
ANYTHING ELSE FROM RICH?

14:03.624 --> 14:05.192
NO. RICH IS JUST
A DECENT GUY

14:05.192 --> 14:08.271
WHOSE FAMILY, COWORKERS, AND
COHORTS ARE STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE,

14:08.271 --> 14:11.122
ANDID I MENTION
THAT HE LOVES SHIPS?

14:11.122 --> 14:12.897
SHE'S CONVINCED
SHE'S GONNA MARRY HIM.

14:12.964 --> 14:16.214
MM-MMM. HE TOLD ME HE'S BEEN WITH
JULIA SINCE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

14:16.214 --> 14:17.650
WELL, WHOEVER SHE IS,

14:17.650 --> 14:20.068
SHE OBVIOUSLY MET
A VERY VIOLENT END.

14:21.090 --> 14:22.302
WHAT, LIKE MURDERED?

14:22.302 --> 14:23.547
IT'S POSSIBLE.

14:23.701 --> 14:26.806
SHE WAS DEFINITELY THROWN
OR JUMPED OVERBOARD.

14:26.848 --> 14:28.714
NOTHING ABOUT SLEEPWALKING?

14:28.714 --> 14:29.776
NO. NO.

14:29.776 --> 14:31.642
I MEAN, HE HAD THESE
SCRATCHES ON HIS BACK,

14:31.642 --> 14:34.186
LIKE FINGERNAILS, BUT-
COULD A GHOST DO THAT?

14:34.186 --> 14:36.314
IF SHE'S ANGRY OR
TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING.

14:36.355 --> 14:37.692
LIKE WHAT?

14:37.692 --> 14:38.831
I DON'T KNOW,

14:38.897 --> 14:40.355
BUT WE BETTER
FIGURE IT OUT

14:40.356 --> 14:42.203
BEFORE THIS PROBLEM
GETS MORE THAN SKIN-DEEP.

14:42.203 --> 14:43.024
YEAH.

14:43.231 --> 14:44.733
I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.

14:49.520 --> 14:50.891
I'M GOING.

14:54.552 --> 14:56.066
AH, THANK YOU.

15:02.297 --> 15:03.530
RICH.

15:04.731 --> 15:06.154
HEY.

15:06.863 --> 15:08.697
THE, UH-
THE 3:08 COCKTAIL'S

15:08.764 --> 15:10.630
THE MOST IMPORTANT
DRINK OF THE DAY.

15:13.430 --> 15:15.530
I'M CELEBRATING.

15:16.184 --> 15:18.831
SHIP'S DOCTOR GAVE ME
A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.

15:19.863 --> 15:21.571
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH ME.

15:21.996 --> 15:23.430
CHEERS.

15:23.497 --> 15:25.664
CAN I GET A BEER? TAP.

15:28.497 --> 15:30.524
<i>CLARIDON ISN'T THE ONLY THING
HEADING TO THE SCRAP YARD</i>

15:30.524 --> 15:32.293
SHE'S DRAGGIN'
MY MARRIAGE WITH HER.

15:32.293 --> 15:34.764
AH. YOU SLEEPIN' A LOT,
TOO, HUH?

15:35.195 --> 15:36.197
TOO?

15:36.263 --> 15:39.556
YEAH, I MEAN, I'M
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M EXHAUSTED.

15:39.831 --> 15:44.530
I MEAN, I KEEP FALLIN' ASLEEP, YOU
KNOW, AT THE WORST POSSIBLE MOMENTS.

15:44.597 --> 15:46.597
MY WIFE'S GETTIN' CRAZY
ABOUT IT.

15:46.664 --> 15:47.831
YOU HAVIN' DREAMS?

15:47.896 --> 15:49.930
YEAH, BUT I-I MEAN,
I DON'T REMEMBER THEM

15:49.996 --> 15:51.364
WHEN I WAKE UP.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

15:51.430 --> 15:52.697
YOU KIDDING ME?

15:52.764 --> 15:54.783
ALMOST LIKE
THEY AREN'T DREAMS.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.764
AND THIS MORNING,
WHEN YOU SAW

15:56.831 --> 15:58.882
THOSE SCRATCHES
ON MY BACK-

15:58.882 --> 16:00.464
YEAH, WHAT WAS
GOIN' ON WITH THAT?

16:00.530 --> 16:03.622
HEH. I KNOW IT
SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT...

16:04.230 --> 16:05.697
THERE'S THIS WOMAN-

16:05.764 --> 16:08.430
LONG HAIR, WEARING
THIS RIPPED BALL GOWN,

16:08.497 --> 16:10.454
AND-AND SHE'S
ALL OVER ME,

16:10.454 --> 16:12.236
HER FINGERNAILS.

16:12.236 --> 16:13.963
HOW CAN A DREAM
DO THAT?

16:14.030 --> 16:14.996
YOU GOT ME.

16:15.063 --> 16:16.664
ALWAYS BEGINS
IN OUR CABIN.

16:16.731 --> 16:19.597
GETS SO HOT IN THERE
I CAN BARELY BREATHE,

16:19.664 --> 16:21.930
AND I DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER FALLING ASLEEP,

16:21.996 --> 16:24.564
AND SHE'S
WHISPERING IN MY EAR,

16:24.630 --> 16:25.896
KISSING ME.

16:26.048 --> 16:27.752
USED TO BE ABLE TO
WAKE MYSELF OUT OF IT,

16:27.752 --> 16:29.654
BUT NOW, I-IT'S LIKE
I'M LOSING MY WILL.

16:29.654 --> 16:31.247
I JUST GO WITH IT,
AND THEN...

16:32.096 --> 16:34.697
I MEAN, I KNOW
IT'S JUST A DREAM,

16:34.764 --> 16:36.330
BUT I-I MEAN,
ON MY HONEYMOON?

16:36.788 --> 16:38.978
AND THEN
SHE TAKES MY HAND,

16:38.978 --> 16:41.364
LEADS ME OUT.
I WAKE UP...

16:41.430 --> 16:44.002
SOMEWHERE WITH NO IDEA
HOW I GOT THERE.

16:48.306 --> 16:50.097
YOU'RE NOT HAVIN'
THE SAME THING?

16:50.163 --> 16:51.664
NO.

16:52.171 --> 16:53.644
OLD GIRLFRIEND, MAYBE?

16:53.644 --> 16:55.153
NAH. I'VE NEVER
SEEN HER BEFORE.

16:55.153 --> 16:57.364
HEY, LOOK, YOU-YOU KNOW A LOT
ABOUT THIS BOAT, DON'T YOU?

16:57.430 --> 16:59.297
<i>YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT
THE S.S. CLARIDON.</i>

16:59.364 --> 17:00.764
MORE THAN ANYONE
SHOULD KNOW. WHY?

17:00.831 --> 17:01.996
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT, UM-

17:02.623 --> 17:04.930
I DON'T KNOW. THE ROOM
YOU'RE STAYIN' IN, M-108.

17:04.996 --> 17:07.277
I'M-I'M MORE
OF A RIVET COUNTER.

17:07.509 --> 17:09.963
BILL BRADFORD MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU OUT THERE. WHY?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.030
WHO'S THAT?

17:11.097 --> 17:12.396
MARITIME HISTORIAN.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.297
HE'S DOING A BOOK SIGNING UP
ON THE MAIN DECK RIGHT NOW.

17:15.364 --> 17:16.564
RIGHT.
WHAT'S THIS, UH-

17:16.630 --> 17:18.797
NOTHING. UH, YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA TALK TO MY WIFE.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.797

17:20.863 --> 17:23.630
SORRY, MAN.

17:23.696 --> 17:25.153
TAKE IT EASY.
THANKS.

17:29.497 --> 17:30.912
THERE YOU GO. ENJOY.

17:32.097 --> 17:33.347
HI, MR. BRADFORD.

17:33.347 --> 17:34.995
COULD YOU SIGN IT
TO MELINDA?

17:34.995 --> 17:36.868
PLEASE. IT'S BILL,
AND I'D BE DELIGHTED.

17:38.382 --> 17:40.197
DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU
A STRANGE QUESTION?

17:40.263 --> 17:42.842
I TRAVEL ON SHIPS
YEAR-ROUND LECTURING

17:42.842 --> 17:45.973
AND MEETING EVERY KIND OF
LINER LOONEY YOU CAN IMAGINE.

17:45.973 --> 17:47.788
BELIEVE ME,
NOTHING'S STRANGE.

17:47.788 --> 17:49.797
UH, IT'S ABOUT CABIN M-108.

17:49.863 --> 17:52.963
HAS ANYTHING TRAGIC
EVER HAPPENED IN THERE?

17:53.030 --> 17:54.197
M-108?

17:54.263 --> 17:55.797
ARE YOU ASKING
IF IT'S HAUNTED?

17:55.863 --> 17:58.276
'CAUSE I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
THIS WHOLE SHIP IS HAUNTED.

17:58.276 --> 17:59.764
YOU THINK?

17:59.831 --> 18:01.397
OH, GHOSTS EVERYWHERE.

18:01.464 --> 18:03.097
IF YOU BELIEVE
THAT SORT OF THING.

18:03.163 --> 18:04.688
PERSONALLY, I DON'T.

18:04.688 --> 18:06.664
FUNNY, YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE A GHOST CHASER.

18:06.731 --> 18:08.147
UH, I JUST HAVE A...

18:08.564 --> 18:10.097
CASUAL INTEREST.

18:10.163 --> 18:12.445
WELL, TO ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION,

18:12.445 --> 18:16.263
THERE WERE 86 RECORDED DEATHS
ON THIS SHIP DURING HER CAREER,

18:16.330 --> 18:17.497
BUT...

18:17.564 --> 18:20.163
NONE SO FAR AS I KNOW
IN M-108.

18:20.230 --> 18:22.416
EXCEPT FOR ROMANCE.
EXCUSE THE POETRY.

18:22.416 --> 18:24.664
LOTS OF RELATIONSHIPS
HIT AN ICEBERG IN THERE.

18:24.731 --> 18:25.664
NOBODY KNOWS WHY.

18:25.731 --> 18:27.392
DO THOSE RECORDS
STILL EXIST?

18:27.392 --> 18:29.497
MM-HMM. THEY'RE ALL PART
OF THE SHIP'S ARCHIVES,

18:29.564 --> 18:31.597
WHICH ARE SADLY ALSO
BEING SOLD AT AUCTION.

18:31.664 --> 18:33.197
I'LL TELL YOU,
IT'S A CRIME

18:33.263 --> 18:35.330
WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN
TO THIS LOVELY LADY.

18:35.397 --> 18:36.597
HER TIME HAS COME, BILL.

18:36.664 --> 18:38.731
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
AS WELL AS ANYBODY.

18:38.797 --> 18:40.545
???

18:40.545 --> 18:42.597
I DON'T SNEAK, BILLY.
CLIFF STURGES.

18:42.664 --> 18:43.831
THIS IS MY FRIEND TERRY.

18:43.896 --> 18:44.831
HI. MELINDA.

18:44.896 --> 18:45.963
NICE TO MEET YOU.

18:46.030 --> 18:47.063
CLIFF OWNS THE SHIP.

18:47.130 --> 18:49.330
HE'S THE ONE SENDING
HER TO THE SCRAPPERS.

18:49.397 --> 18:51.397
WELL, HE'S DEFINITELY OFF
MY CHRISTMAS CARD LIST.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.797
<i>THE CLARIDON'S
COMPLETELY OUTDATED,</i>

18:52.863 --> 18:55.992
AND WHEN THE NEW SAFETY
REGULATIONS KICK IN IN 2010,

18:55.992 --> 18:58.996
PRACTICALLY HAVE TO GUT THE
WHOLE SHIP AND START OVER AGAIN.

18:59.063 --> 19:01.764
STILL, IT'S SAD TO LOSE SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF HISTORY.

19:01.831 --> 19:03.330
I'M WITH YOU.

19:03.397 --> 19:06.063
WELL, SHIPS ARE
A LOT LIKE PEOPLE.

19:06.130 --> 19:07.996
WE ALL HAVE TO DIE
SOMETIME.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.386
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE US...

19:55.497 --> 19:57.430
COME WITH ME.

21:01.597 --> 21:04.463
TELL ME YOU'RE SORRY.

21:08.630 --> 21:10.364
WHY AM I HERE?

21:21.830 --> 21:24.051
I WOKE UP,
AND HE WAS GONE.

21:24.051 --> 21:26.126
AND THE DOOR WAS OPEN,
AND...

21:26.703 --> 21:28.437
I GOT HERE
RIGHT AS HE FELL.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.150
HE'S GONNA BE OK.
THEY GOT HIM.

21:30.282 --> 21:32.015
YOU PULLED THE ALARM?

21:32.015 --> 21:34.569
NO. I JUST STARTED SCREAMING,
A-AND THE ALARM WENT OFF.

21:34.636 --> 21:36.289
THEN WHO SOUNDED IT?

21:36.436 --> 21:39.016
I DON'T KNOW. RICH!

21:40.037 --> 21:41.070
THANKS.

21:41.137 --> 21:42.669
THANK GOD YOU'RE OK.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.736
MAYBE IT WAS
YOUR GHOST.

21:51.203 --> 21:53.103
YOU COULD HAVE
KILLED HIM.

21:53.170 --> 21:54.103
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

21:54.170 --> 21:55.003
YEAH.

21:55.070 --> 21:56.437
I DIDN'T MEAN...

21:56.504 --> 21:58.437
SHE WAS SCREAMING
AND SCREAMING

21:58.504 --> 22:00.386
FOR SOMEONE
NAMED RICH.

22:00.386 --> 22:01.903
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT
THERE? I DON'T KNOW.

22:01.970 --> 22:03.504
I REALIZED
IT WASN'T HIM.

22:03.569 --> 22:06.203
WHO? YOUR FIANCÉ?

22:07.158 --> 22:08.829
LOOK WHAT HE DID TO ME.

22:16.407 --> 22:18.402
SHE'S LOOKING
FOR HER FIANCÉ.

22:18.810 --> 22:20.556
HE THE REASON
SHE'S SO BANGED UP?

22:20.818 --> 22:22.191
I THINK HE MAY HAVE
KILLED HER,

22:22.191 --> 22:23.601
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE WANTS REVENGE

22:23.601 --> 22:25.202
OR FOR HIM TO MEET HER
IN THE AFTERLIFE.

22:25.202 --> 22:27.663
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT IT
ALL GOES BACK TO CABIN M-108.

22:27.663 --> 22:29.350
WAIT. SO WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO CHANGE ROOMS?

22:29.350 --> 22:30.616
YEAH, JUST FOR
THE NIGHT, BUT I WON'T

22:30.683 --> 22:31.920
LET HER HURT YOU.
DON'T WORRY.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.274
NO, WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT

22:33.274 --> 22:34.887
IS I'M ACTUALLY FINDING THIS
KIND OF EXCITING.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.710
I MEAN,
WHAT DOES THAT MAKE ME?

22:36.710 --> 22:38.289
A MAN I LOVE.

23:11.169 --> 23:12.677
JIM, WAKE UP.

23:19.002 --> 23:22.202
MY HUSBAND ISN'T THE MAN THAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR EITHER,

23:22.269 --> 23:23.872
SO MAYBE YOU
SHOULD TALK TO ME.

23:23.872 --> 23:25.401
HE'S NOT
MY FIANCÉ?

23:25.625 --> 23:26.802
UH, NO.

23:26.869 --> 23:28.567
IS THAT WHY YOU'VE BEEN
HAUNTING THIS ROOM?

23:29.249 --> 23:30.923
HE DOESN'T KNOW
I'M HERE.

23:32.169 --> 23:33.569
NO ONE DOES.

23:34.536 --> 23:36.469
I HAVE TO FIND HIM.

23:36.536 --> 23:38.503
HE HAS TO PAY
FOR WHAT HE DID.

23:44.319 --> 23:45.503
JIM, WAKE UP!

23:45.569 --> 23:46.902
HEY, WH-WAIT A MINUTE.
I WAS, UH-

23:46.969 --> 23:48.481
DREAMING?
DID YOU SEE HER?

23:48.481 --> 23:50.670
NO. NO, I CAN'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING.

23:50.736 --> 23:52.654
LOOK, JUST GET DRESSED.
THE GHOST WAS HERE.

23:53.329 --> 23:55.469
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
I JUST SAW THE WORD "AFT"

23:55.536 --> 23:56.603
BRUISED INTO HER BACK.

23:56.670 --> 23:57.948
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

23:57.948 --> 23:59.403
THE REAR OF THE SHIP.

23:59.469 --> 24:01.169
I KNOW THAT, BUT-
BUT WHAT'S IT DOING THERE?

24:01.236 --> 24:02.829
I DON'T KNOW. IT LOOKED
LIKE SHE'D FALLEN

24:02.829 --> 24:04.567
OR WAS PUSHED
AGAINST SOMETHING.

24:06.202 --> 24:08.656
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU DON'T
REMEMBER ANY OF YOUR DREAM?

24:08.829 --> 24:10.503
YEAH, SCOUT'S HONOR. WHY?

24:10.569 --> 24:12.432
GOOD. COME ON.

24:12.452 --> 24:13.483
WHERE ARE WE GOIN'?

24:13.483 --> 24:14.731
AFT.

24:16.103 --> 24:17.521
WHAT ABOUT
THE SCRATCHES?

24:17.521 --> 24:18.703
I DON'T KNOW YET.

24:18.770 --> 24:21.202
THE GHOST JUST LATCHES ON TO
WHATEVER GUY IS STAYING IN THE ROOM?

24:21.269 --> 24:22.636
IT'S CLASSIC
IMPRINT HAUNTING.

24:22.703 --> 24:24.569
THE GHOST REPEATS THE SAME
BEHAVIOR OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

24:24.636 --> 24:26.369
WE KNOW THAT HER FIANCÉ|WAS IN THAT ROOM,

24:26.436 --> 24:28.022
WE KNOW THAT HE
OBVIOUSLY HURT HER,

24:28.022 --> 24:29.935
BUT IT'S LIKE HE DIDN'T
KNOW SHE WAS ON THE SHIP.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.257
SHE SAID NOBODY KNEW.

24:31.257 --> 24:32.635
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

24:32.635 --> 24:34.136
WHENEVER YOU SEE HER, SHE'S
RUNNING OR HIDING, RIGHT?

24:34.202 --> 24:35.136
YEAH. WHY?

24:35.202 --> 24:36.336
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A STOWAWAY.

24:36.403 --> 24:38.136
YOU MIGHT BE THE SMARTEST MAN
ON THIS SHIP.

24:38.202 --> 24:39.336
AWESOME. WHAT ARE WE
LOOKING FOR?

24:39.403 --> 24:40.770
ANYTHING THAT SAYS "AFT."
ALL RIGHT.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.196
THIS IS WHERE HER BODY
WAS THROWN OVERBOARD.

25:05.196 --> 25:07.254
WAIT A MINUTE. SHE WAS
ALREADY DEAD BEFORE-

25:07.254 --> 25:10.425
YEAH. AND I THINK ONE
OF THE CREW MEMBERS KILLED HER.

25:11.687 --> 25:14.080
SO WHILE ELI FINISHED
HIS GHOST TO-DO LIST,

25:14.080 --> 25:16.793
I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY FINDING
OUT PASSENGER INFORMATION.

25:16.793 --> 25:18.819
THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE
WHO HAVE STAYED IN M-108

25:18.819 --> 25:20.647
OVER THE YEARS-
MIND-BOGGLING.

25:20.647 --> 25:22.344
NOT ONE OF THEM DIED.

25:22.344 --> 25:24.010
YEAH, AND IF SHE
WAS A STOWAWAY,

25:24.077 --> 25:26.149
IT'S GONNA BE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
TO FIGURE OUT WHO SHE WAS.

25:27.102 --> 25:29.336
YOU KNOW, I HATE
TO BRING THIS UP, BUT...

25:29.403 --> 25:31.500
DO YOU THINK YOUR FRIEND BETTY
MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE GHOST?

25:31.500 --> 25:33.518
'FRAID NOT.
SHE KEEPS TO HERSELF.

25:35.869 --> 25:38.637
FANTASTIC DRESS, BY
THE WAY. HAUTE COUTURE?

25:38.903 --> 25:40.555
SHE DOESN'T,
AND THANKS.

25:40.555 --> 25:41.686
SAMPLE SALE.

25:42.303 --> 25:44.002
OK. UM-

25:44.002 --> 25:46.053
HEH. SO YOU THINK SHE WAS
MURDERED AND THEN THROWN OVERBOARD.

25:46.053 --> 25:47.481
YEAH, AND POSSIBLY
BY HER FIANCÉ.

25:47.481 --> 25:49.253
I MEAN, I READ
IN BILL BRADFORD'S BOOK

25:49.253 --> 25:52.329
THAT SOME OF THE CREW WOULD USE
EMPTY STATEROOMS FOR HOOKUPS.

25:52.329 --> 25:54.334
WOW. SO YOU THINK
HE KILLED HER THERE.

25:54.334 --> 25:56.636
YEAH, AND NOW SHE'S HAUNTING ANY
COUPLE WHO STAYS IN THAT ROOM,

25:56.685 --> 25:59.455
YOU KNOW, CONFUSING THEM FOR
THE MAN WHO KILLED HER. ZIP ME.

26:00.935 --> 26:03.025
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. NOW, IN
YOUR VISION, YOU SAW A PITCHFORK?

26:03.025 --> 26:04.392
PITCHFORK?

26:04.392 --> 26:05.880
YEAH. I HAD THIS VISION,

26:05.880 --> 26:07.586
AND THERE WAS TRASH
ON THE DECK,

26:07.586 --> 26:10.769
LIKE EGGS, FLOUR, AND
A PITCHFORK, 3 PRONGS.

26:10.975 --> 26:13.120
OH, IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE
NEPTUNE'S TRIDENT

26:13.120 --> 26:15.046
FOR THE CROSSING THE LINE
CEREMONY.

26:15.046 --> 26:18.400
WHENEVER A SHIP CROSSES THE
EQUATOR, THE CREW DRESSES IN COSTUME

26:18.400 --> 26:20.322
AND INITIATES ANYONE
WHO'S NEVER CROSSED BEFORE.

26:20.322 --> 26:22.206
IT'S CALLED
THE NEPTUNE RITUAL.

26:23.036 --> 26:25.858
<i>SO HOW MANY TIMES HAS THE
CLARIDON CROSSED THE EQUATOR?</i>

26:25.858 --> 26:28.366
I'M A GHOST, HON,
NOT AN ANCIENT MARINER.

26:29.236 --> 26:31.015
JIM, WE HAVE WORK TO DO
BEFORE DINNER.

26:32.079 --> 26:33.384
TOODLES.

26:37.336 --> 26:38.802
NEEDLE, MEET HAYSTACK.

26:38.869 --> 26:40.598
<i>WELL, SO FAR, WE KNOW
THAT THE CLARIDON</i>

26:40.598 --> 26:42.648
HAS CROSSED
THE EQUATOR 8 TIMES

26:42.648 --> 26:44.606
DURING WORLD WAR II
AS A TROOP SHIP,

26:44.606 --> 26:47.754
BUT SERIOUSLY DOUBT THERE WAS
ANYONE IN A BALL GOWN ABOARD.

26:48.045 --> 26:49.331
WAIT. HERE'S SOMETHING.

26:49.618 --> 26:51.624
<i>VOYAGE 401, S.S. CLARIDON.</i>

26:51.624 --> 26:53.027
"THE FUN WAY TO RIO."

26:53.027 --> 26:54.841
FILE FOR THE WHOLE TRIP'S HERE.

26:54.841 --> 26:56.339
IS THERE A DATE?

26:56.339 --> 26:59.531
YEAH. LEAVING NEW YORK
MARCH 30, 1975,

26:59.598 --> 27:00.865
RETURNING 3 WEEKS LATER.

27:00.931 --> 27:02.898
AND THEN CROSSING
THE LINE TWICE.

27:02.965 --> 27:03.848
YEAH.

27:05.231 --> 27:06.698
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

27:06.764 --> 27:09.666
UH, PICTURES OF
THE NEPTUNE RITUAL.

27:10.901 --> 27:13.030
THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THE FUN WAY TO RIO.

27:13.097 --> 27:15.757
IT IS IF YOU ENJOY HAVING
FLOUR AND EGGS POURED ON YOU

27:15.757 --> 27:17.648
BEFORE BEING DUNKED
IN THE POOL.

27:18.498 --> 27:19.731
OH, MY GOD.

27:19.798 --> 27:20.898
WHAT?

27:20.965 --> 27:22.364
THAT'S HIM.

27:22.431 --> 27:25.134
THAT'S THE GUY THAT I SAW
THROWING THE BODY OVERBOARD.

27:27.498 --> 27:29.598
AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER
WAS NICE ENOUGH

27:29.664 --> 27:31.197
TO WRITE DOWN
THEIR NAMES.

27:31.264 --> 27:32.705
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME.

27:36.064 --> 27:37.727
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

27:37.965 --> 27:40.030
OH, HI. LOOK, I'M RUNNING
A LITTLE LATE FOR DRINKS,

27:40.097 --> 27:41.750
BUT, UH, IF YOU'D
LIKE TO MEET AFTER...

27:41.750 --> 27:44.464
YOU WERE PART OF THE SHIP'S
CREW IN THE SEVENTIES.

27:47.064 --> 27:49.421
THAT'S RIGHT.
WROTE ABOUT IT IN MY BOOK.

27:49.421 --> 27:51.898
AND YOU WERE ABOARD
THE RIO CRUISE IN 1975,

27:51.965 --> 27:54.293
WHERE A WOMAN'S BODY
WAS THROWN OVERBOARD.

27:54.293 --> 27:57.223
SHE HAD THE WORD "AFT"
BRUISED INTO HER BACK.

27:57.735 --> 27:59.622
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, DON'T YOU?

28:01.965 --> 28:02.931
HOW-

28:02.997 --> 28:04.164
HER GHOST IS STILL HERE,

28:04.231 --> 28:06.244
AND I'VE TALKED TO HER.

28:06.331 --> 28:07.932
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
BELIEVE THAT OR NOT,

28:07.932 --> 28:10.087
BUT I THINK YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS.

28:15.231 --> 28:16.598
UM...

28:20.164 --> 28:22.405
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

28:22.731 --> 28:24.931
I HATED LAW SCHOOL,
SO I QUIT,

28:24.997 --> 28:28.698
AND I WAS SO THRILLED TO BE
SERVING ON THIS GREAT SHIP.

28:28.764 --> 28:30.364
I STARTED
IN THE ENGINE ROOM.

28:30.431 --> 28:31.997
WERE YOU ENGAGED?
ME? OH, NO.

28:32.064 --> 28:33.197
CONFIRMED BACHELOR.

28:33.264 --> 28:35.865
YEAH, BUT YOU STILL
HAVEN'T TOLD US WHO SHE WAS.

28:36.651 --> 28:39.115
SHE SAID HER NAME
WAS LORELEl.

28:40.664 --> 28:42.424
IT WAS MY FIRST SAILING.

28:42.731 --> 28:44.997
I WAS DOWN ON THE WELL DECK

28:45.064 --> 28:49.076
WHEN I CAUGHT HER SNEAKING
OUT OF THE CARGO HOLD.

28:49.076 --> 28:51.197
HEY. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE DOWN HERE.

28:51.264 --> 28:53.898
SHE HAD STOWED AWAY
BEFORE WE DEPARTED RIO

28:53.965 --> 28:56.197
AND HAD BORROWED
SOMETHING TO WEAR

28:56.264 --> 28:57.720
SO SHE COULD SNEAK
INTO FIRST CLASS.

28:58.158 --> 28:59.614
Jim: YOU DIDN'T
TURN HER IN?

28:59.614 --> 29:03.264
NO. MAYBE IF I HAD,
SHE'D STILL BE ALIVE.

29:03.331 --> 29:04.431
I DON'T KNOW.

29:04.498 --> 29:05.842
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

29:06.955 --> 29:08.679
SHE WAS
AN AMERICAN

29:08.679 --> 29:10.865
WORKING AS
AN AU PAIR IN RIO.

29:11.465 --> 29:13.098
THERE'S THIS GUY. ONCE I FIND HIM,
HE'LL PAY FOR MY TICKET, I PROMISE.

29:13.165 --> 29:14.631
TOLD ME SHE'D
COME ONBOARD

29:14.698 --> 29:16.132
TO SURPRISE A MAN THAT
SHE'D FALLEN IN LOVE WITH.

29:16.198 --> 29:18.831
I'M AFRAID SHE
DIDN'T SAY HIS NAME.

29:18.898 --> 29:21.511
SO WE MADE
A SILLY DEAL.

29:21.511 --> 29:22.779
IT WAS KID STUFF,
REALLY.

29:22.779 --> 29:24.731
I WOULDN'T
TURN HER IN,

29:24.798 --> 29:26.865
AND SHE WOULDN'T TELL
MY COMMANDING OFFICER

29:26.931 --> 29:28.399
I WAS SMOKING
WHILE I WAS ON DUTY.

29:28.465 --> 29:29.564
SO IS IT A DEAL?

29:29.631 --> 29:31.798
THEN I TOLD HER HOW TO
GET UP TO FIRST CLASS,

29:31.865 --> 29:34.887
AND I WARNED HER NOT
TO LET ANYBODY SEE HER.

29:38.015 --> 29:40.065
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
I SAW HER ALIVE.

29:40.132 --> 29:42.798
SHE WAS-SHE WAS
RUNNING OFF EXCITED,

29:43.023 --> 29:44.691
SO FULL OF LIFE.

29:45.787 --> 29:47.564
3 DAYS LATER...

29:50.298 --> 29:51.997
I FOUND HER BODY HERE.

30:05.188 --> 30:07.497
THIS AREA IS CALLED
THE SHAFT ALLEY?

30:07.497 --> 30:08.761
THAT'S RIGHT.

30:10.703 --> 30:12.908
CHIEF ENGINEER ORDERED ME...

30:14.499 --> 30:16.544
TO DISPOSE OF HER BODY.

30:17.698 --> 30:19.174
SHE WAS JUST SOME...

30:19.174 --> 30:22.027
STUPID STOWAWAY, AND IT
WOULD LOOK BAD FOR THE COMPANY.

30:22.500 --> 30:25.561
2 YEARS LATER, HE GOT HIS
THROAT SLIT AFTER A CARD GAME.

30:25.898 --> 30:27.432
SERVED HIM RIGHT.

30:27.499 --> 30:28.698
MR. LINARCOS.

30:29.229 --> 30:30.921
YEAH. I MET HIM, TOO.

30:30.921 --> 30:32.227
AW, JEEZ.

30:32.689 --> 30:34.277
THIS GHOST THING
IS REAL.

30:34.277 --> 30:36.021
LIKE YOU
WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

30:36.664 --> 30:38.263
SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

30:41.428 --> 30:43.317
I WAS A SCARED KID,

30:43.998 --> 30:48.113
AND I WAS FOLLOWING
SOME REALLY BAD ORDERS.

30:49.664 --> 30:51.650
BEEN HAUNTED BY IT
EVER SINCE.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.524
APPARENTLY YOU'RE
NOT THE ONLY ONE.

30:56.546 --> 30:58.298
IT'S HOT IN HERE.

30:58.365 --> 30:59.631
WHERE DOES THIS GO?

30:59.698 --> 31:02.032
IT, UH, GOES THE FULL
HEIGHT OF THE SHIP.

31:02.098 --> 31:03.817
CREWMEN USE IT TO GET
FROM ONE DECK TO ANOTHER

31:03.817 --> 31:05.797
WITHOUT BEING SEEN
BY THE PASSENGERS.

31:05.797 --> 31:08.825
WAIT. HONEY, YOU THINK SOMEBODY
KILLED HER AND THEN HID HER BODY HERE?

31:08.825 --> 31:10.962
OR THEY DUMPED HER
FROM ABOVE.

31:11.697 --> 31:13.834
BUT SHE WAS STILL ALIVE
WHEN SHE HIT THE BOTTOM.

31:13.834 --> 31:16.404
A
- ARE THERE CABIN ASSIGNMENTS IN THAT FILE?

31:16.404 --> 31:18.726
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHO WAS IN M-108.

31:20.912 --> 31:23.054
CLIFF STURGES.
IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

31:23.054 --> 31:24.839
WELL, HIS FAMILY OWNED
THE SHIPPING LINE.

31:25.222 --> 31:26.839
WE COULD ALWAYS
GO ASK HIM.

31:26.839 --> 31:28.136
HE'S ABOARD?

31:29.095 --> 31:30.393
NO. WAIT.
NOW?

31:30.393 --> 31:31.839
HE'S COME BACK FOR ME?

31:31.839 --> 31:33.112
Melinda: LORELEl!

31:34.865 --> 31:36.835
WE HAVE TO FIND CLIFF
RIGHT AWAY.

31:36.835 --> 31:39.668
RIGHT.
COME ON, BILL.

31:44.409 --> 31:46.183
MR. STURGES,
ARE YOU IN THERE?

31:47.698 --> 31:49.522
WHERE'S THE SHIP'S DOCTOR?
CLIFF'S COLLAPSED.

31:49.522 --> 31:50.859
I'M A PARAMEDIC.

31:50.898 --> 31:52.937
HE WAS COMPLAINING
ABOUT BEING HOT,

31:52.937 --> 31:54.666
AND THEN HE FELL
ONTO THE BED.

31:54.917 --> 31:57.009
LORELEl,
YOU HAVE TO STOP.

31:57.465 --> 31:58.765
Terry:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:58.831 --> 31:59.998
WHO'S LORELEl?

32:00.065 --> 32:01.355
DON'T ASK.

32:02.981 --> 32:05.034
THANK YOU FOR
HELPING ME FIND HIM.

32:06.946 --> 32:09.316
NOW WE CAN BE
TOGETHER FOREVER.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.566
SHE DIED IN 1975?

32:18.566 --> 32:19.400
Terry: HERE, HONEY.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.152
<i>Melinda: YES,
ABOARD THE CLARIDON.</i>

32:21.428 --> 32:24.063
she ???

32:25.626 --> 32:27.730
BUT HOW?
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:27.797 --> 32:29.577
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL US?

32:30.445 --> 32:32.630
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
SHE DISAPPEARED.

32:32.697 --> 32:34.635
LAST TIME I EVER SAW HER
WAS ON THE AFT DECK.

32:34.635 --> 32:36.069
IN THOSE DAYS,
YOU WERE ALLOWED

32:36.069 --> 32:38.565
TO HAVE GUESTS ON THE SHIP
WHEN SHE WAS IN PORT.

32:39.489 --> 32:41.088
WE'D BEEN DOCKED
FOR A WEEK IN RIO.

32:41.155 --> 32:43.443
I- I MET HER THAT FIRST DAY...

32:43.443 --> 32:44.022
OH, MY GOD.

32:44.088 --> 32:46.585
IN A SMALL CAFE
ON THE AVENUE RIO BRANCO.

32:47.455 --> 32:50.775
FROM THEN ON,
WE WERE LIKE SOUL MATES.

32:51.022 --> 32:52.289
MARRY ME.

32:52.355 --> 32:54.672
MARRY ME RIGHT NOW AND
COME BACK TO THE STATES.

32:54.672 --> 32:56.707
I- I WANT TO, BUT...

32:56.855 --> 32:58.656
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE NOW.

32:58.722 --> 32:59.589
THIS IS CRAZY.

32:59.656 --> 33:01.122
THEN I'LL SEND FOR YOU.

33:01.188 --> 33:03.322
BUT IN THE MEANTIME...

33:04.681 --> 33:06.255
I GOT YOU THIS.

33:07.689 --> 33:09.297
WE WERE SO YOUNG.

33:13.355 --> 33:15.629
THEY CALLED
ALL VISITORS ASHORE.

33:17.118 --> 33:18.586
THEN SHE LEFT.

33:19.622 --> 33:21.589
I NEVER SAW HER AGAIN.

33:22.446 --> 33:24.262
AS SOON AS I GOT
BACK ON THE DOCK,

33:24.262 --> 33:26.122
I KNEW I WAS
MAKING A MISTAKE.

33:26.188 --> 33:27.848
THERE WERE SOME MEN
LOADING CARGO

33:27.848 --> 33:29.719
TOWARD THE FRONT
OF THE SHIP.

33:29.821 --> 33:31.955
I JUST WALKED
RIGHT PAST THEM.

33:32.233 --> 33:34.399
SHE SNUCK BACK ONBOARD.

33:34.489 --> 33:35.992
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

33:36.371 --> 33:38.121
SHE JUST TOLD ME.

33:40.988 --> 33:42.589
UM...

33:42.656 --> 33:44.712
I HAVE A GIFT.

33:45.055 --> 33:47.341
I CAN SEE AND TALK
TO THE DEAD.

33:49.888 --> 33:51.768
Bill:
TRUST ME, CLIFF.

33:52.267 --> 33:53.821
YOU SHOULD LISTEN
TO HER.

33:53.888 --> 33:55.689
IN THAT CASE, TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

33:55.756 --> 33:58.489
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO KNOW
FOR THE LAST 33 YEARS.

33:58.555 --> 33:59.921
HE'S LYING.

34:00.826 --> 34:02.367
HE HURT ME.

34:02.855 --> 34:04.855
SHE SAID YOU'RE LYING

34:04.921 --> 34:06.777
AND THAT YOU HURT HER.

34:08.121 --> 34:09.888
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

34:09.955 --> 34:12.188
AFTER THE SHIP
HAD SAILED,

34:12.255 --> 34:14.638
I FOUND SOME CLOTHES
IN THE CARGO DECK.

34:17.688 --> 34:19.288
I WENT TO FIND
HIS ROOM,

34:19.955 --> 34:21.222
M-108.

34:21.289 --> 34:24.389
WE HAD STAYED THERE
MOST OF THE WEEK

34:24.455 --> 34:26.331
WHILE THE SHIP
WAS ANCHORED.

34:31.327 --> 34:33.467
I WAS SO HUMILIATED,

34:33.888 --> 34:35.719
AND I KNEW
IF I GOT CAUGHT,

34:35.719 --> 34:37.268
HIS FAMILY OWNED
THE SHIPPING LINE

34:38.150 --> 34:39.989
AND HE'D FIND OUT
I WAS THERE,

34:39.989 --> 34:42.594
AND I'D JUST BE THIS
PATHETIC GIRL

34:42.594 --> 34:44.755
WHO WAS STUPID ENOUGH
TO BELIEVE HE LOVED ME.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.342
SHE WENT TO YOUR ROOM,

35:25.573 --> 35:27.500
AND SHE SAW YOU
KISSING ANOTHER WOMAN.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.391
OF COURSE. UH...

35:34.088 --> 35:36.334
PATSY, MY FIANCÉE.

35:36.334 --> 35:37.843
WHAT, YOU HAD 2?

35:39.155 --> 35:41.662
MY FAMILY PRESSURED ME
TO GET ENGAGED TO HER.

35:41.662 --> 35:44.222
THAT'S WHY I'D GONE ON THAT
CRUISE, TO THINK THINGS THROUGH.

35:45.019 --> 35:47.714
THAT NIGHT,
AFTER THE SHIP SET SAIL,

35:47.714 --> 35:49.322
PATSY SURPRISED ME
IN MY ROOM.

35:49.389 --> 35:50.322
SHE'D GOTTEN NERVOUS,

35:50.389 --> 35:52.088
AND SHE'D FLOWN
DOWN TO RIO.

35:52.489 --> 35:54.689
I MET SOMEONE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT...

35:54.756 --> 35:57.143
SO I SAT HER DOWN, AND I
TOLD HER ABOUT LORELEl.

35:58.588 --> 36:01.219
IF LORELEl SAW A KISS,
IT WAS...

36:02.622 --> 36:04.519
JUST PATSY SAYING GOOD-BYE.

36:07.455 --> 36:08.988
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

36:12.355 --> 36:14.355
I TRIED TO OPEN
THE HATCH.

36:16.589 --> 36:18.055
BUT IT WAS STUCK.

36:20.578 --> 36:23.039
SO I STARTED UP
TO THE NEXT DECK.

36:23.138 --> 36:24.884
it was so hot in there

36:24.884 --> 36:26.806
and ???

36:40.258 --> 36:41.956
I DIDN'T KNOW.

36:42.855 --> 36:44.422
MY GOD, WE-

36:47.222 --> 36:49.055
WE WERE SO IN LOVE.

36:50.555 --> 36:51.656
I- I'M SORRY, TERRY.

36:51.722 --> 36:54.558
THIS MUST BE DIFFICULT
FOR YOU TO HEAR.

36:54.722 --> 36:56.422
IT EXPLAINS A LOT.

36:56.489 --> 36:58.821
WE'VE BEEN GOING TOGETHER
FOR NEARLY 3 YEARS,

36:58.888 --> 37:01.860
AND HE STILL INTRODUCES
ME AS HIS FRIEND.

37:02.022 --> 37:03.888
THAT'S WHY I CAME
ON THIS CRUISE,

37:03.955 --> 37:05.890
SO THAT I COULD
LET GO OF THE PAST.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.331
ALL THESE YEARS, I'VE BEEN
OBSESSED WITH LORELEl.

37:08.331 --> 37:10.132
I FLEW DOWN TO RIO TWICE,

37:10.289 --> 37:13.689
BUT THE FAMILY SHE WAS WORKING
FOR SAID SHE JUST VANISHED ONE DAY.

37:14.275 --> 37:16.355
I LOOKED FOR HER
IN THE STATES AND...

37:16.422 --> 37:19.289
EUROPE. I HIRED PRIVATE
DETECTIVES, BUT NOTHING.

37:19.355 --> 37:21.487
I MEAN, YOU PROBABLY
THINK I'M NUTS.

37:21.487 --> 37:25.327
I MEAN, I KNEW THIS GIRL FOR
ONE WEEK WHEN I WAS 20 YEARS OLD.

37:26.921 --> 37:28.988
BUT I NEVER FORGOT HER...

37:29.397 --> 37:30.808
EVER.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.041
I FOUND THIS ON THE FLOOR
THE DAY SHE LEFT.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.913
I THOUGHT SHE'D
SOMEHOW MANAGED

37:51.913 --> 37:54.002
TO SLIP IT BACK
INTO MY POCKET.

37:58.055 --> 37:59.740
I'VE KEPT IT WITH ME
EVER SINCE.

38:04.355 --> 38:08.251
I'VE COME BACK TO THAT ROOM
LOOKING FOR HIM OVER AND OVER.

38:09.008 --> 38:10.888
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO THAT ANYMORE.

38:11.788 --> 38:13.555
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT ANYONE.

38:15.455 --> 38:17.503
I LOVED HIM SO MUCH.

38:18.756 --> 38:21.475
I LOOKED IN A THOUSAND FACES
TRYING TO FIND HIM.

38:22.355 --> 38:24.870
HE'S STILL SO HANDSOME.

38:27.522 --> 38:29.540
SHE LOVED YOU...

38:30.455 --> 38:33.455
SO MUCH SHE NEVER
STOPPED LOOKING FOR YOU.

38:34.555 --> 38:36.675
NEITHER ONE OF US DID.

38:36.922 --> 38:39.225
WE WERE BOTH CHASING A DREAM
WE COULD NEVER CATCH.

38:45.227 --> 38:47.597
MAYBE HE DID
CATCH THE DREAM.

38:49.455 --> 38:51.216
HE JUST DOESN'T
KNOW IT YET.

38:55.955 --> 38:57.188
WHAT IS THAT?

38:57.923 --> 38:59.435
IT'S FOR YOU.

39:00.455 --> 39:02.389
YOU CAN MOVE ON NOW.

39:06.689 --> 39:08.822
TELL CLIFF HE SHOULD, TOO.

39:25.240 --> 39:28.004
UH, IT'S FOR
ALL OF YOU.

39:28.722 --> 39:31.379
YOU CAN SEE IT 'CAUSE
YOU'RE READY TO GO.

39:40.289 --> 39:41.955
UH-UH.

39:53.389 --> 39:54.822
HEY.

39:55.222 --> 39:56.888
HI.

39:59.132 --> 40:00.669
BEAUTIFUL SIGHT,
ISN'T IT?

40:01.810 --> 40:04.555
I WAS JUST SAYING TO JIM
IT'S SO SAD.

40:04.622 --> 40:06.155
SUCH A WONDERFUL SHIP.

40:06.222 --> 40:09.167
AH. AND THAT'S WHY
I'M CALLING OFF THE AUCTION,

40:10.205 --> 40:13.315
DECIDED TO PUT HER UP FOR
SALE AS A FLOATING MUSEUM.

40:13.622 --> 40:15.589
WHY THE CHANGE
OF HEART?

40:17.188 --> 40:19.555
I THINK I WANTED TO BREAK
HER UP FOR SELFISH REASONS,

40:19.622 --> 40:23.835
REASONS THAT DON'T REALLY EXIST
ANYMORE, THANKS TO MELINDA.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.443
CAN I TELL THEM?

40:28.155 --> 40:29.978
WELL, I HAVEN'T
CHANGED MY MIND.

40:30.555 --> 40:32.422
CLIFF PROPOSED
TO ME THIS MORNING.

40:32.489 --> 40:34.489
OH, MY GOD.
CONGRATULATIONS.

40:34.555 --> 40:36.522
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

40:36.589 --> 40:40.955
AND NOW, IF YOU COULD
ALL BE MY WITNESSES...

40:51.689 --> 40:53.988
SAW THAT IN A MOVIE ONCE.

40:56.915 --> 40:58.455
THANKS, MELINDA.

40:59.835 --> 41:01.255
YOU'RE WELCOME.

41:11.322 --> 41:13.487
Betty: THEY'VE BEEN
GOING AT IT LIKE BUNNIES.

41:18.122 --> 41:19.788
NOT THAT I NOTICED.

41:21.122 --> 41:23.646
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T GO
WITH THE OTHERS LAST NIGHT?

41:24.855 --> 41:28.656
WHEN I WAS 39, MY DOCTOR TOLD
ME I HAD CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE

41:28.722 --> 41:30.522
AND COULD DROP DEAD
ANY SECOND,

41:30.589 --> 41:34.222
SO I PACKED ALL MY BEST
CLOTHES, MY MEDICAL RECORDS,

41:34.289 --> 41:37.222
<i>GOT MY WILL IN ORDER, AND BOOKED
A WORLD CRUISE ON THE CLARIDON.</i>

41:38.014 --> 41:40.352
I WANTED IT TO LAST FOREVER.

41:41.355 --> 41:42.888
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

41:44.489 --> 41:46.886
THE SHIP'S OWNER
JUST TOLD ME THAT HE'S

41:46.886 --> 41:48.801
<i>NOT SENDING THE
CLARIDON TO THE BREAKERS.</i>

41:50.355 --> 41:52.489
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE
ANYMORE.

41:52.555 --> 41:54.489
YOU SHOULD GO
INTO THE LIGHT.

41:54.555 --> 41:56.555
HA! ARE YOU KIDDING?

41:56.622 --> 41:59.022
THE ONLY PLACE I'M GOING
IS INTO THE BAR.

41:59.452 --> 42:01.289
BON VOYAGE.

42:06.022 --> 42:07.612
HI.

42:08.489 --> 42:10.188
ALL RIGHT.

42:14.222 --> 42:16.522
JUST WANNA SEE IF
THE FRIDGE CAME IN.

42:16.589 --> 42:18.253
NICE.
AHH.

42:21.722 --> 42:23.955
HEY. WHOA.

42:25.222 --> 42:26.704
YOU ALL RIGHT?

42:26.704 --> 42:28.442
YEAH. IT'S JUST,
YOU KNOW,

42:28.442 --> 42:30.155
THE WHOLE TIME
WE WERE ON THE BOAT,

42:30.222 --> 42:31.591
I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY SEASICKNESS,

42:31.591 --> 42:33.149
AND NOW THAT
WE'RE ON DRY LAND...

42:33.149 --> 42:33.933
RIGHT.

42:36.155 --> 42:37.656
HEY, YOU DON'T THINK,

42:37.722 --> 42:39.422
UM...

42:43.616 --> 42:45.916
I MIGHT BE PREGNANT.
