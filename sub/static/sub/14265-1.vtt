01:20.450 --> 01:23.661
Come on, Daddy!
Let's go play on the beach.

01:23.662 --> 01:25.528
Just going to take my
shoes off, okay?

01:33.670 --> 01:35.460
Yeah, it's cold, huh?

01:37.732 --> 01:40.259
It's going to be
a big castle.

01:42.489 --> 01:44.889
Let me know if you
strike oil, okay?

02:26.714 --> 02:29.249
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

02:29.889 --> 02:31.201
I've been waiting
here forever.

02:31.202 --> 02:33.500
Oh, Dad.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.373
The train was on time,
you're always early.

02:35.374 --> 02:38.000
- Are you starting already?
- Why? You can’t take it?

02:38.001 --> 02:40.168
Come on, let’s go home.

03:01.975 --> 03:03.656
You alright, honey?

03:20.484 --> 03:23.308
You know there's things
you can tell me.

03:23.309 --> 03:25.867
I’m not as bad at
communication and...

03:25.868 --> 03:28.259
so on and so forth as
you might think.

03:28.294 --> 03:30.288
I've lived in the world.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.711
I'm not pregnant.

03:34.712 --> 03:38.039
No. No, I wasn't
saying that.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.809
Yeah you were.

03:44.887 --> 03:46.500
Are you seeing someone?

03:47.335 --> 03:48.765
Yeah, I am.

03:52.047 --> 03:54.331
Someone with a name?

03:55.442 --> 03:57.676
- Nah, you wouldn't like him.
- How do you know that?

03:57.677 --> 03:59.954
How do you know
I wouldn't like him?

04:01.052 --> 04:02.973
I wish you had someone.

04:02.974 --> 04:06.691
Who says I don’t have a honey
stashed away somewhere?

04:16.771 --> 04:18.839
You're my girl.

05:17.241 --> 05:19.894
Yeah, well, I'm not really
sure how to cook it.

05:19.895 --> 05:23.627
You finally got a vegetable and
I don’t know if I can eat it.

05:23.628 --> 05:26.869
You alright? You've been
to the doctor, right?

05:26.870 --> 05:28.455
When was the last
time you went?

05:28.456 --> 05:31.971
- I have a physical every year.
- That's right. They make you.

05:31.972 --> 05:35.470
Careful. So how did you
get time off from work?

05:35.471 --> 05:37.841
You don’t even know
what I do.

05:37.842 --> 05:39.454
Of course I know
what you do.

05:39.455 --> 05:43.481
Dad. I'm a glorified intern.
I can get off when I want.

05:44.619 --> 05:46.712
I wanted to come home.

05:47.435 --> 05:49.099
I'm glad you did.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.038
Maybe you'll tell me
what's bothering you.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.992
I'm just tired, you know.

05:54.993 --> 05:56.881
I think I got a bug.

05:56.882 --> 06:01.385
Yeah? Want to lay down?
Go upstairs, lay down.

06:01.386 --> 06:03.121
I got your room all
ready for you.

06:03.122 --> 06:05.138
I know you do, Dad.

06:05.522 --> 06:07.721
Ginger-ale. That will settle
your stomach. I'll get some.

06:07.722 --> 06:10.011
I always keep some
ginger-ale on hand.

06:25.060 --> 06:27.449
Honey, honey.
You alright?

06:28.949 --> 06:29.759
- Dad...
- Yeah?

06:29.760 --> 06:33.229
Oh my god I have to
go to a doctor!

06:33.230 --> 06:35.873
Dad, I got to tell you something
I should have told you!

06:42.407 --> 06:43.656
I got you.

06:46.029 --> 06:47.239
CRAVEN!

06:56.470 --> 06:58.359
Oh Jesus!

07:06.042 --> 07:07.891
You're my girl.

07:08.555 --> 07:13.025
I... I know...

07:23.415 --> 07:26.957
Through this
holy anointment...

07:26.958 --> 07:27.994
love and mercy...

07:28.029 --> 07:29.804
with... with the grace...

07:29.805 --> 07:32.539
may the... may the...

08:14.514 --> 08:16.377
About five nine, five ten.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.744
Thinks he was white from
what he could see through

08:17.745 --> 08:19.294
the eyes of the ski mask.

08:19.295 --> 08:22.221
Yelled out one word, "Craven",
and then he fired.

08:22.222 --> 08:24.763
Jesus Christ.

08:27.491 --> 08:30.857
Then he ran.
Didn't pursue.

08:58.266 --> 09:01.234
You want some water or
coffee or something?

09:03.246 --> 09:05.768
You want something
stronger?

09:05.769 --> 09:07.724
I know somewhere in there
is a bottle of Crown Royal

09:07.759 --> 09:10.221
with dust all over it.

09:15.409 --> 09:19.004
You're going to put the first
foot forward, Tommy,

09:19.005 --> 09:23.950
I don’t care if it’s now.
I'll sit with you, okay?

09:25.586 --> 09:27.258
Get out.
Get out of here.

09:27.259 --> 09:29.122
He's not a basket
case. Get out.

09:29.123 --> 09:32.555
- Somebody make some coffee.
- I want a glass of ginger ale.

09:32.556 --> 09:34.188
Get him a ginger ale.

09:40.784 --> 09:43.283
We'll get him, Tommy.

09:44.139 --> 09:45.865
You know how we
react to thing like this.

09:45.866 --> 09:46.826
Officer involved.

09:47.535 --> 09:51.942
"Office involved". We ought to
do that for everybody, right?

09:51.943 --> 09:54.441
"Officer involved". Who the fuck
do you think you are?

09:54.442 --> 09:58.065
If you want to get philosophical,
I'll get philosophical.

10:00.210 --> 10:03.719
- Want to get cleaned up?
- No, I'm alright.

10:05.159 --> 10:07.394
I want you to come stay
with Carol and me.

10:07.395 --> 10:08.767
No.

10:09.837 --> 10:12.688
- You can't stay here.
- It's where I live.

10:15.835 --> 10:17.401
- If you won't come with me...
- Just tell everybody to just

10:17.402 --> 10:20.764
get out of here, just finish
what they got to do and go.

10:21.103 --> 10:22.815
This is someone armed
and dangerous...

10:22.816 --> 10:24.257
What do you think I am?

10:27.066 --> 10:29.060
Can everybody get out?
I'd like them to go,

10:29.061 --> 10:30.837
can they just go finish
what they do and go?

10:30.838 --> 10:33.365
Get out.
Get out!

12:20.007 --> 12:24.385
Craven's phone. Hello?

12:44.253 --> 12:46.277
<i>Are you alright?</i>

12:48.998 --> 12:51.819
<i>Dad, are you alright?</i>

12:54.405 --> 12:56.394
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:00.626 --> 13:02.470
Whose my little girl?

13:02.471 --> 13:03.431
M.

13:04.232 --> 13:05.490
Whose one of
those sweethearts?

13:05.491 --> 13:06.739
M.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.271
<i>...shooting last night, the
daughter of a Boston</i>

13:38.272 --> 13:41.598
<i>Police Detective leads our
news. Emma Craven, 24,</i>

13:41.599 --> 13:44.296
<i>an MIT graduate, was killed
in front of her home in</i>

13:44.297 --> 13:47.982
<i>Roslindale by a man thought
to be targeting her father..</i>

13:51.026 --> 13:53.344
<i>Cathy, from what I understand,
police don't have much to</i>

13:53.345 --> 13:54.560
<i>go on right now.</i>

13:54.561 --> 13:57.210
<i>Lisa, there is still a lot of
unanswered question when it</i>

13:57.211 --> 13:59.770
<i>comes to this case.
24 year old Emma Craven</i>

13:59.771 --> 14:02.604
<i>was gunned down outside of
this Roslindale home on the</i>

14:02.605 --> 14:06.922
<i>porch just behind me. Sources
tell me the suspect in this case...</i>

14:06.923 --> 14:08.282
Turn that shit off.

14:12.164 --> 14:14.836
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:17.527 --> 14:19.130
None of your neighbors
saw anything.

14:19.131 --> 14:22.105
And the rain hasn't left
much for forensics.

14:22.751 --> 14:25.458
We need to go through
your cases, Tommy.

14:26.592 --> 14:29.430
You must have an instinct
on this. Something.

14:29.847 --> 14:31.894
Not off the top
of my head, no.

14:32.303 --> 14:34.550
They want to see you
upstairs first, anyway.

14:34.551 --> 14:35.713
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:35.714 --> 14:38.381
This is off-subject, but this
is my daughters phone.

14:38.382 --> 14:40.803
I need a list of all the contacts,
I got to talk to her friends,

14:40.804 --> 14:41.849
- associates, whatever...
- Yeah yeah.

14:41.850 --> 14:43.615
Janet can do all that.
Don't worry about it.

14:43.616 --> 14:44.864
Blocked incomings too.

14:49.564 --> 14:50.631
Tom.

14:51.383 --> 14:55.845
Sorry for your loss. Anything
you need from me and Mary.

14:55.846 --> 14:57.681
And let us know about
the arrangements.

14:57.682 --> 14:59.649
It'll be in the Globe
and the Herald.

14:59.650 --> 15:01.886
I haven't been down to,
you know, the...

15:03.306 --> 15:04.681
Thank you.

15:06.860 --> 15:08.339
Bill Whitehouse
is running things.

15:08.340 --> 15:11.416
He has every resource this
department possesses.

15:11.915 --> 15:15.462
This is a cop thing.
Officer involved.

15:17.423 --> 15:21.167
So, will you take a
leave of absence?

15:21.519 --> 15:22.767
No.

15:26.267 --> 15:29.323
We can't have you on this
investigation. It's a rule.

15:29.324 --> 15:31.715
Well, since it's me that's got
to figure out who would want

15:31.716 --> 15:34.602
to kill me, for reasons only
I would know about, then

15:34.603 --> 15:37.613
I'd rather get paid for it.
So the rules don't apply.

15:41.780 --> 15:44.967
- He's right, isn’t he?
- I think he is, yeah.

15:47.847 --> 15:50.203
I have to make a statement to
the media. Is there anything

15:50.204 --> 15:52.569
you want in there? You
want to stand with me?

15:52.570 --> 15:55.427
- No, thank you.
- They want to see you.

15:55.428 --> 15:57.751
I don't want any part of it.

16:03.138 --> 16:04.518
Alright.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.026
I'm not going to sit in the
Murder Room. No point to it.

16:08.027 --> 16:10.031
There's no physical evidence.

16:10.032 --> 16:14.967
If we got the gun or something.
Jesus, I can't think.

16:15.983 --> 16:18.659
It'll come to me.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.609
It'll come to me but it's not
going to come to me here.

16:21.610 --> 16:23.735
I've got to drive around.
I have to think.

16:24.053 --> 16:25.818
You do what you need to do.
You keep me informed.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.604
I'll punch you in.

16:28.095 --> 16:30.426
I got to go. The Coroner
wants to ID the body.

16:30.427 --> 16:31.718
- Are you up to it?
- Yeah.

16:31.719 --> 16:33.722
I want my case files
brought up.

16:33.723 --> 16:36.642
Nothing this year makes any
sense to me at all.

16:36.643 --> 16:37.891
Tommy.

16:42.063 --> 16:44.355
I'll have them sent
to your house.

16:44.797 --> 16:46.378
Sure.

16:52.449 --> 16:55.808
Cause of death: injuries
arising from gunshot wounds.

16:55.809 --> 17:00.521
Massive hemorrhage. Heart
seizures due to shock.

17:06.352 --> 17:09.020
Tom, this is very difficult.

17:11.344 --> 17:13.424
You've done this before,
but it's not the same...

17:13.425 --> 17:14.673
Let's get it over with.

17:25.246 --> 17:29.069
Is this your daughter,
Emma Charlotte Craven?

17:29.243 --> 17:30.626
Yes, it is.

17:32.912 --> 17:34.286
Leave her alone.

18:02.116 --> 18:04.106
Let me have
some scissors.

18:04.814 --> 18:09.502
- What was that Tom?
- Scissors. I need some scissors.

19:00.605 --> 19:01.948
Don't cry.

19:03.665 --> 19:04.802
I'm not.

19:12.992 --> 19:15.226
I don’t know if
I can make it.

19:16.387 --> 19:17.671
You have to.

19:23.598 --> 19:24.850
Alright.

19:31.906 --> 19:34.875
You're wasting two guys
here at my house, Bill.

19:34.876 --> 19:36.291
If you want them in the
neighborhood, then have

19:36.292 --> 19:37.742
them going door to door.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.388
Someone's trying to kill
you Tom. They're staying.

19:40.751 --> 19:45.190
I got nothing. Nothing.
I don't have enemies.

19:45.191 --> 19:46.764
I never lived life or said
what I thought enough

19:46.765 --> 19:48.009
to have enemies.

19:48.010 --> 19:49.341
Listen, you know
I understand.

19:49.342 --> 19:51.495
I'm not stuck in a personal
conversation with you, Bill.

19:51.496 --> 19:53.120
Don't get nervous.

19:55.157 --> 19:57.322
And tell the two uniforms
in the cruiser to stop pissing

19:57.323 --> 20:00.093
in the bushes. They can
come into the house.

20:24.187 --> 20:26.454
This is your beach.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.957
<i>Hey Daddy.
Come on in.</i>

20:59.958 --> 21:01.635
<i>Come on, Daddy!</i>

21:14.449 --> 21:16.821
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll be right there.

21:16.822 --> 21:18.222
Go on.

22:01.160 --> 22:03.084
"NORTHMOOR"

23:01.492 --> 23:04.296
"Weapons Query"
"Searching..."

23:05.278 --> 23:07.613
"David Burnham"

23:18.660 --> 23:19.919
Tom!

23:20.950 --> 23:22.748
You ready for this?

23:23.016 --> 23:25.475
Ski mask found in a hedge
five doors from you.

23:25.476 --> 23:28.716
We got hair. Caucasian.
It's in for DNA.

23:31.218 --> 23:34.009
- Keep me posted.
- Where are you going?

25:37.503 --> 25:39.799
Mr. Burnham?
Mr. Burnham, yeah?

25:39.800 --> 25:41.048
Yeah.

25:41.049 --> 25:43.928
Settle down. Alright?
I'm not going to hurt you.

25:47.883 --> 25:52.955
I see you know my daughter.
Are you her boyfriend?

25:54.365 --> 25:57.340
Alright. Okay.
I'm Emma’s father.

25:57.709 --> 25:59.797
I'm going to let you go now.
You're going to be alright.

25:59.798 --> 26:01.581
- Okay?
- Yeah.

26:01.582 --> 26:04.579
Okay, be nice. Okay?
Jesus.

26:08.045 --> 26:11.113
I'm sorry but you're going to
get the fuck out of here now.

26:11.639 --> 26:15.312
Give me a minute, alright?
I want to ask you some questions.

26:15.313 --> 26:16.589
Why not answer the door
like everybody else?

26:16.590 --> 26:18.419
What the hell are
you so scared of?

26:20.772 --> 26:23.152
Is this your handgun?

26:23.689 --> 26:26.173
How did my daughter get
a god damned handgun?

26:26.174 --> 26:27.452
Did you give it to her?
Is this yours?

26:27.453 --> 26:29.195
I gave it to her.

26:30.684 --> 26:32.409
Alright.

26:32.410 --> 26:34.106
Why?

26:35.245 --> 26:36.872
I didn't notice a shotgun
in your list of weapons.

26:36.873 --> 26:38.867
- Do you own one?
- Do you think that I...?

26:38.868 --> 26:40.074
Your pistol.

26:40.075 --> 26:42.450
You licensed it in Vermont,
it's illegal in Massachusetts.

26:42.451 --> 26:44.683
I tell the local police barracks
you opened the door with it

26:44.684 --> 26:46.934
that's an automatic year in jail.
Not that I don’t have you

26:46.935 --> 26:49.992
by the balls already for trying
to stick me in the doorway.

26:49.993 --> 26:52.623
- You'd be lying.
- I don't care.

26:52.624 --> 26:54.838
I know you.
You're her dad.

26:55.375 --> 26:58.613
And you never came to
visit her. Didn't even bother.

27:01.221 --> 27:04.810
Yeah, well... you
worked with her.

27:05.470 --> 27:08.415
And I need to know what
kind of trouble she was in.

27:08.416 --> 27:10.424
I can't talk about that.

27:10.425 --> 27:13.764
There's security structures.
Clearance to what we do.

27:13.765 --> 27:15.637
I understand you
won't help me.

27:15.638 --> 27:17.647
But I'm confused you
won’t help Emma.

27:17.648 --> 27:21.556
She's dead, man. There's
no way to help Emma.

27:24.422 --> 27:26.411
There are probably two
fucking guys out there

27:26.412 --> 27:29.215
watching and listening to
us right fucking now

27:32.124 --> 27:36.393
Now, I'm sorry, but you need
to get the fuck out of here now.

27:36.394 --> 27:37.711
Please.

27:38.371 --> 27:39.962
Or I'm dead.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.465
There's something
I need to give you.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.953
Yeah? Sure, go ahead.

28:15.104 --> 28:17.089
Here's the keys
to her place.

28:17.090 --> 28:19.917
And her personal things.

28:20.548 --> 28:21.645
Thanks.

28:22.894 --> 28:24.683
I'm going to leave you alone
now until you realize

28:24.684 --> 28:27.866
you got to talk to me.
Alright?

28:27.867 --> 28:29.069
Yeah.

28:29.480 --> 28:30.771
I know you're a good guy
otherwise Emma wouldn't

28:30.772 --> 28:32.501
have nothing to
do with you.

28:32.948 --> 28:35.822
Here's my card. It's got
my cell on it, okay?

28:35.823 --> 28:37.223
Call.

29:57.062 --> 29:59.548
You were right,
I don’t like him.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.704
Why did you have
a gun, honey?

32:05.739 --> 32:07.036
Jesus.

32:09.002 --> 32:11.947
Is there something I
could do for you, Millroy?

32:11.948 --> 32:14.211
What do you do
usually, Jedburgh?

32:15.489 --> 32:18.743
If someone has a national
security problem...

32:18.744 --> 32:21.322
they dial a number in
(Northern Virginia?)

32:21.757 --> 32:24.343
And then I decide
what happens next.

32:24.882 --> 32:26.564
What's your problem?

32:27.206 --> 32:30.104
You're a consultant in security.
I'm merely consulting.

32:30.105 --> 32:31.732
So consult.

32:36.353 --> 32:38.502
There's a company
called Northmoor.

32:38.503 --> 32:41.652
They own a number of
defense department contracts.

32:42.610 --> 32:44.458
It's not an agency front,
if that's what you think.

32:44.459 --> 32:48.032
- It's a real private company.
- That is unusual.

32:48.033 --> 32:50.820
They have private security.
Autonomous security.

32:50.821 --> 32:53.239
I'm autonomous myself.

32:53.548 --> 32:54.780
These are the facts:

32:55.872 --> 32:58.566
One of their secure facilities
was penetrated.

32:58.567 --> 33:00.413
Three people died
making their escape.

33:00.414 --> 33:02.829
A fourth, an employee who
may have been involved

33:02.830 --> 33:03.992
has been killed.

33:04.282 --> 33:07.120
- By Northmoor security?
- I didn't say that.

33:07.698 --> 33:09.280
No one would.

33:09.281 --> 33:11.343
Fact is, we don't know.

33:17.707 --> 33:20.147
She was shot dead
five nights ago.

33:20.148 --> 33:22.723
Her father is a
Boston Detective.

33:22.724 --> 33:25.348
Boston police are working
on the assumption

33:25.349 --> 33:26.916
that her father was
the target.

33:26.917 --> 33:29.566
And what assumption
are we working on?

33:29.567 --> 33:31.615
That he wasn't.

33:33.214 --> 33:37.368
- Who killed her?
- That's not the issue at this point.

33:37.369 --> 33:39.705
National security
is the issue.

33:40.976 --> 33:45.534
I know your function, Jedburgh.
This has to be cleaned up.

33:45.535 --> 33:48.121
Whatever it takes.

33:48.122 --> 33:49.782
Yes.

33:50.715 --> 33:54.400
Are you absolutely sure you
want me to look into this?

33:55.900 --> 33:58.670
Cause you have to be
absolutely sure.

34:03.089 --> 34:06.005
- She was killed in Boston.
- Yeah.

34:08.012 --> 34:09.502
But this isn't a
part of that.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.797
You think it's a
funeral robbery?

34:12.797 --> 34:14.291
Yeah.

34:14.744 --> 34:16.420
Look..

34:17.014 --> 34:18.746
I don't want this mixed up
with the other business.

34:18.746 --> 34:20.766
I don't need the
trouble, alright?

34:22.685 --> 34:25.193
Do me a solid in
Boston sometime.

34:26.136 --> 34:27.454
Thanks.

34:47.826 --> 34:48.571
Hello?

34:48.572 --> 34:51.826
Hello. My name is
Tom Craven.

34:51.827 --> 34:54.291
Your number was in my
daughters phone records.

34:54.292 --> 34:57.301
I'm Emma's father.
I'm a policeman.

34:58.050 --> 35:00.970
I just want to know what
you were to Emma.

35:01.723 --> 35:02.943
Find out what happened.

35:02.944 --> 35:05.477
It says in the papers
what happened.

35:06.242 --> 35:08.396
Someone tried to kill you
and they got her.

35:08.397 --> 35:10.153
Is that what you
think happened?

35:10.154 --> 35:13.042
<i>I run a shop.
A luggage shop.</i>

35:14.174 --> 35:15.725
I want to keep
running a shop.

35:15.819 --> 35:18.461
I'd like to talk to
you in person.

35:18.462 --> 35:22.525
- Would you do that?
- About Northmoor?

35:22.526 --> 35:26.222
Yeah, sure. About anything
you want to talk about.

35:27.538 --> 35:29.055
How do I know
you're you?

35:29.240 --> 35:30.712
When you meet me,
you will know that guy

35:30.713 --> 35:33.056
can't be anyone else
but Emma's father.

35:36.096 --> 35:37.473
Will you help me?

35:39.188 --> 35:41.460
I'm out of state,
I'm at my grandmothers.

35:41.936 --> 35:43.857
I have your number,
I'll call you.

35:57.002 --> 35:59.282
I'm here to see
John Bennett.

36:17.667 --> 36:21.680
Detective Craven.
Jack Bennett.

36:22.452 --> 36:24.918
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

36:24.953 --> 36:27.823
Can I say how shocked we all
were to hear of Emma's death.

36:27.824 --> 36:29.675
She was a valued
member of our team.

36:29.676 --> 36:31.436
I can't say I knew her
very well personally, but

36:31.437 --> 36:34.757
she is well thought of.
She is missed.

36:34.758 --> 36:36.007
Thank you.

36:36.679 --> 36:38.855
In the Sixties, this hill
was excavated.

36:38.890 --> 36:40.910
The site for Nike
nuclear missiles.

36:40.911 --> 36:43.331
Miles of tunnels
and launch chambers.

36:43.332 --> 36:46.948
- I'm sure Emma told you.
- She never talked about work.

36:46.949 --> 36:49.642
So Northmoor bought this
from the federal government?

36:49.643 --> 36:53.260
- Well, we lease it.
- For money?

36:53.261 --> 36:56.717
- Coffee?
- I'll have a ginger ale.

36:57.028 --> 36:58.276
Certainly.

36:58.949 --> 37:01.045
Annie, get Detective Craven
a ginger ale, would you?

37:01.046 --> 37:03.640
- Of course.
- Please.

37:18.750 --> 37:20.689
You have interesting friends.

37:21.802 --> 37:23.259
Yes.

37:23.484 --> 37:26.480
This facility, R&D in general,
earns a great deal of money

37:26.481 --> 37:29.867
to Massachusetts. As
reflected in the tax breaks.

37:30.549 --> 37:31.758
How may I help you?

37:31.759 --> 37:34.622
I supposed I want to know
what my daughter did here.

37:34.623 --> 37:35.858
In what sense?

37:36.733 --> 37:38.409
She didn't tell you
about our work?

37:38.410 --> 37:41.849
She was following your
security protocols.

37:41.850 --> 37:44.444
And what are they in
your understanding?

37:44.445 --> 37:47.474
I don’t understand anything.
She never talked about work.

37:47.475 --> 37:48.724
Right.

37:49.238 --> 37:50.965
Well you'll understand that
most of what we do here

37:50.966 --> 37:53.363
is classified. Almost
everything we do.

37:53.364 --> 37:55.679
What she did, despite
her qualifications,

37:55.680 --> 37:57.369
your daughter
was a trainee.

37:57.801 --> 37:59.917
Of course, she was a full
employee and there's a...

37:59.918 --> 38:02.953
benefit package I suppose you
should see Personnel about.

38:02.954 --> 38:04.976
I'm not interested
in that just yet.

38:05.357 --> 38:08.071
All our people are
very well insured.

38:08.366 --> 38:09.623
I bet they are.

38:11.851 --> 38:14.614
Well, what we do here...

38:15.484 --> 38:17.516
Norhtmoor is essentially
a research facility.

38:17.551 --> 38:19.548
We have a mandate from
government to develop

38:19.549 --> 38:23.241
a safe and clean energy source
based on fusion technology.

38:23.276 --> 38:25.168
- Very green.
- And weapons?

38:26.267 --> 38:27.629
Do you make them?

38:28.223 --> 38:30.401
Well, If we did, it
would be classified.

38:31.077 --> 38:33.581
I can tell you, since you are a
policeman and have access to

38:33.582 --> 38:36.282
this information anyway, that
Northmoor is an important part

38:36.283 --> 38:39.473
of the nation’s nuclear stockpile
and maintenance program.

38:39.474 --> 38:42.178
We ensure that the nations
nuclear stockpile remains ready

38:42.179 --> 38:43.530
for the presidents order.

38:44.044 --> 38:47.276
- Not weapons, raw materials.
- Emma was a part of this?

38:47.277 --> 38:49.916
God no. As an intern, she didn't
have any direct involvement

38:49.917 --> 38:52.994
whatsoever. She worked on
the research floor.

38:54.528 --> 38:58.798
We all very very much
regret Emma's death.

38:59.724 --> 39:01.906
It must be especially
painful for you.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.608
In the circumstances.

39:03.609 --> 39:07.358
You mean that she was
shot instead of me.

39:07.359 --> 39:11.281
As a parent I can only guess
at your pain, I think.

39:11.282 --> 39:14.955
Though I'm sure I cannot
imagine its full dimensions.

39:15.837 --> 39:17.982
I've taken up enough
of your time.

39:17.983 --> 39:19.666
I'd like to talk to
her friends if any.

39:19.667 --> 39:22.852
Yes, of course. I'll see what
I can do. I'll tell Personnel.

39:22.853 --> 39:24.833
Give you a list. Of contact
numbers and so forth.

39:24.834 --> 39:27.075
Can I ask you a question?

39:29.742 --> 39:31.825
What does it feel like?

39:48.217 --> 39:50.355
- David.
- You ready for this?

39:50.356 --> 39:52.895
- I'm ready for anything.
- We have a DNA match.

39:52.896 --> 39:55.860
Oh, really?
Give me the skinny.

40:26.538 --> 40:28.732
You got no buzz of
this guy? Nothing?

40:28.733 --> 40:32.778
This guy was a professional.
This guy was a hit man.

40:38.851 --> 40:41.776
What's the matter? You
were looking at something.

40:41.777 --> 40:43.116
Tell me what you're
looking at.

40:43.117 --> 40:45.908
It says in the evidence log the
hair you found was 2,5 inches.

40:45.909 --> 40:47.624
So he cut his hair.

40:47.625 --> 40:49.507
Not as recently as
a week ago.

40:49.508 --> 40:52.645
- So what are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

40:52.646 --> 40:55.427
Hair can stick to a hat
for a long time. Years.

40:56.144 --> 40:57.412
Decades.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.703
Why would a pro blow off
two barrels with a shotgun

40:59.704 --> 41:03.893
instead of saving
one for his target?

41:32.712 --> 41:34.243
Creeping up on a bereaved
man at a murder scene

41:34.436 --> 41:35.946
is not very bright.

41:36.631 --> 41:39.127
Mr. Craven, we have
things to talk about.

41:39.752 --> 41:41.740
Like your name and
what you're doing here?

41:41.741 --> 41:44.160
Like who shot
your daughter.

41:46.648 --> 41:48.304
You know who
shot my daughter?

41:48.305 --> 41:51.069
If I was looking for a man who
might have shot your daughter,

41:51.070 --> 41:54.610
and I had a limited imagination,
of which I do not,

41:54.611 --> 41:58.043
I might have looked at the
poor bastard you found today.

41:58.898 --> 42:00.627
A known killer.

42:00.998 --> 42:06.805
An unusually well known
killer. Makes you think.

42:08.301 --> 42:11.262
- What are you burning?
- None of your business.

42:21.394 --> 42:22.884
Yeah, go ahead.

42:26.030 --> 42:29.077
- Cigar?
- Not celebrating just now.

42:29.078 --> 42:32.097
I know you don't smoke.
I saw your DARPA file.

42:32.098 --> 42:34.977
That's my way of telling you
you've got a DARPA file.

42:36.413 --> 42:38.329
Are you going to tell
me what that is?

42:38.330 --> 42:41.669
Defense Advance Research
Project Agency.

42:41.670 --> 42:45.459
Their slogan is:
"Scienta est Potentia"

42:45.460 --> 42:47.536
And I know you know Latin.

42:48.712 --> 42:52.100
Sto sursum. You know what
that means, yeah?

42:52.101 --> 42:54.925
- Stand the fuck up.
- Please do so.

43:17.363 --> 43:19.723
Well it seems like you're
no one in particular.

43:20.164 --> 43:22.047
Just some English guy,
standing on my lawn,

43:22.048 --> 43:24.527
with a District of Columbia
drivers license.

43:25.482 --> 43:26.860
Thank you.

43:28.824 --> 43:32.000
- Is Northmoor part of DARPA?
- Well, that's hard to tell.

43:34.113 --> 43:34.750
Why are you here?

43:34.751 --> 43:37.246
Your daughter was flagged as
a possible terrorist threat to

43:37.247 --> 43:39.917
United States of America.

43:41.185 --> 43:44.037
I said "flagged",
I didn't say she was.

43:48.409 --> 43:50.493
It's funny the Boston Police
Department didn't come up

43:50.494 --> 43:52.264
- with that one.
- Funny if they had.

43:52.265 --> 43:55.409
What the fuck are you
burning out there?

43:55.602 --> 43:57.235
Fucking Christ.

43:57.236 --> 44:01.837
My English friend Mr. Davenport,
about 6 feet tall, 220 pounds,

44:01.838 --> 44:03.965
is enjoying a cigar.

44:04.585 --> 44:06.476
Did he put it out?

44:08.477 --> 44:10.559
You said my daughter
was a terrorist.

44:11.136 --> 44:14.108
I didn't. But someone did.

44:15.901 --> 44:18.005
Who are you, Mr. Jedburgh?

44:18.294 --> 44:19.757
I'm a friend of the corps.

44:19.758 --> 44:22.428
And I'm a bit fucking
cold out here.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.107
Pills, pills, pills.

44:28.108 --> 44:31.973
Not like when we were kids.
When it was pills, pills, pills

44:31.974 --> 44:34.135
in a very different context.

44:37.342 --> 44:40.071
You're not much of a
partier, are you Craven?

44:40.072 --> 44:42.117
Do you believe in fun?

44:42.526 --> 44:44.451
What, do you mean recently?

44:47.357 --> 44:49.408
What's your interest
in my daughter’s death?

44:49.409 --> 44:52.669
I don't like the look of it.
Tell me what you think.

45:08.237 --> 45:09.775
Do you recognize?

45:10.891 --> 45:12.183
Should I?

45:12.795 --> 45:16.644
They broke into a US classified
nuclear research facility,

45:16.645 --> 45:20.445
then drowned in the Connecticut
river making their escape.

45:20.446 --> 45:23.615
Now I know that sounds like
bollocks. But it's not.

45:23.616 --> 45:26.210
Northmoor isn't federal.
I checked.

45:26.211 --> 45:29.256
So if you're saying my daughter
was involved with these people

45:29.257 --> 45:31.770
the most you can get her
for is trespassing.

45:31.771 --> 45:35.868
Her apartment was tossed.
Her computer was stolen.

45:36.309 --> 45:39.291
And do the police know
that you know that?

45:41.348 --> 45:42.712
No.

45:46.126 --> 45:48.365
You're a smart fucker.

45:48.774 --> 45:50.516
What does Northmoor do?

45:51.840 --> 45:52.910
What have they done?

45:52.911 --> 45:56.547
The people who drowned
belonged to "Night Flower".

45:56.548 --> 45:59.596
Tree huggers. Militants.
New Age fuckups.

45:59.597 --> 46:01.525
Sometimes they
blow shit up.

46:01.526 --> 46:04.448
Infrequently, and
not very well.

46:04.449 --> 46:07.559
You can look them up.
The organization itself,

46:07.560 --> 46:10.329
not the dead guys.
They are classified.

46:12.055 --> 46:16.682
She wasn't an activist. Not the
type. My daughter wasn't a joiner.

46:16.717 --> 46:18.838
She was more like me.

46:19.286 --> 46:22.756
If she did anything, whatever
she did, she did it alone.

46:23.039 --> 46:26.548
There's a point where anyone
can become an activist.

46:26.943 --> 46:31.586
I mean you see something
so wrong, you have to act.

46:31.587 --> 46:34.271
Even if it means
the end of you.

46:35.508 --> 46:38.462
Let’s just say
she was involved.

46:38.463 --> 46:41.807
Her companions died.
Then she came home.

46:41.842 --> 46:43.890
She didn't say anything.

46:44.777 --> 46:47.845
She meant to, she wanted to,
but she didn't make it.

46:53.216 --> 46:57.004
I'm going to advise my
department of one,

46:57.005 --> 47:01.571
which is me, to let you
continue your investigation,

47:01.572 --> 47:05.408
even if you sometimes burn
the evidence in your backyard.

47:05.409 --> 47:08.128
And you, an officer
of the corps.

47:09.644 --> 47:11.711
I'm not going to
arrest anyone.

47:13.354 --> 47:14.856
I never do.

47:16.012 --> 47:18.142
Will you try to stop me?

47:19.824 --> 47:21.872
It depends.

47:30.475 --> 47:32.281
See you around.

47:34.288 --> 47:38.485
I do sometimes like that
feel like Diogenes.

47:38.486 --> 47:41.005
You know the guy who
walked around with a lamp.

47:41.006 --> 47:43.351
Looking for an honest man.

47:44.181 --> 47:45.795
How did it turn out?

47:45.796 --> 47:49.837
Well, for him?
I don't remember.

47:49.838 --> 47:52.170
But you and I have
done pretty good.

47:53.124 --> 47:54.939
Bonne chance.

48:20.667 --> 48:23.212
I thought you were going to
wait until I was a nice guy.

48:25.439 --> 48:27.255
As a career move man, I
seriously need to be seen

48:27.256 --> 48:29.072
telling you to fuck off.
You have no idea,

48:29.073 --> 48:31.289
you don't understand.
Go home! Go home!

48:35.239 --> 48:37.324
There's nothing you
can do to me.

48:37.970 --> 48:39.211
There are times when you
don’t have a choice what

48:39.212 --> 48:41.012
kind of fucking guy you are.

48:41.013 --> 48:43.733
You understand that because
you're doing it right now.

48:45.338 --> 48:46.394
May I?

48:51.830 --> 48:54.916
Drinking the good stuff because
your job is going so well?

48:54.917 --> 48:56.682
Is this an intervention?

48:56.683 --> 48:58.242
If it is I'd like to call a
few people that don't

48:58.243 --> 49:01.054
whack me around because
I’m afraid for my life.

49:08.934 --> 49:11.812
I assumed you'd be
some kind of scientist.

49:11.813 --> 49:14.553
Didn't think your daughter
would go for a grease monkey?

49:16.400 --> 49:19.763
Something like that. Yeah.
If you want to beat yourself up.

49:20.408 --> 49:23.249
And what if I said she said
I reminded her of you?

49:23.592 --> 49:25.199
Except drinking.

49:25.964 --> 49:28.187
Something to do with the
absence of bullshit and

49:28.188 --> 49:30.867
no patience for
Broadway musicals.

49:32.039 --> 49:33.995
You're looking at me
like I'm crazy.

49:33.996 --> 49:36.623
Somebody shot my girlfriend,
have you factored that in?

49:37.278 --> 49:39.212
What do you know
about Night Flower?

49:44.221 --> 49:47.349
- Politics don't interest me.
- What did interest you?

49:50.039 --> 49:51.205
Emma.

49:56.680 --> 50:00.701
Look. I'm under contract.
I have a five year contract.

50:00.702 --> 50:03.463
I'm surveilled. I'm going to
loose my fucking job

50:03.464 --> 50:05.729
if I talk to you no
matter who's dead.

50:07.495 --> 50:09.875
How did my daughter get
people through the security

50:09.876 --> 50:12.751
in a classified nuclear
R&D facility?

50:13.894 --> 50:15.451
There's a rumor
she had help.

50:15.452 --> 50:17.847
- You?
- No.

50:18.069 --> 50:20.269
I passed the polygraph
at work.

50:23.354 --> 50:24.650
What happened?

50:25.406 --> 50:26.916
Come on, level with me
here, I'm not a cop.

50:26.917 --> 50:28.886
Now it's just you and me.
What happened?

50:33.014 --> 50:34.699
You got somewhere
else we can talk?

50:38.946 --> 50:42.511
You didn't pass the polygraph,
they just told you you did.

50:43.706 --> 50:46.127
Emma was writing to
Senator Pine.

50:46.128 --> 50:49.685
And at some point she went
to this grease ball loco.

50:49.686 --> 50:50.737
A lawyer to see about
getting out of her...

50:50.738 --> 50:52.849
What was the name
of the lawyer?

50:53.801 --> 50:57.095
- Sampson... Sanderman.
- Sanderman.

50:57.096 --> 50:59.831
Anyway, said nobody
could help her.

50:59.832 --> 51:02.270
Whistleblowers always
sound like psychos.

51:02.271 --> 51:04.160
And I didn't get
back to her.

51:04.161 --> 51:06.451
So she helped out these
Night Flower assholes.

51:07.682 --> 51:09.695
She got them in through
the cooling tunnels.

51:11.457 --> 51:15.112
She didn't go in herself.
But she was there.

51:16.263 --> 51:18.867
How was Emma
exposed to radiation?

51:19.569 --> 51:20.850
She wasn't.

51:21.610 --> 51:24.376
That's what I’m saying, she
didn't go into the tunnels,

51:24.377 --> 51:26.395
they were exposed, but she
couldn't have been exposed,

51:26.396 --> 51:28.341
she wasn't in the tunnels.

51:29.554 --> 51:31.765
What happened to the
people that went in?

51:31.766 --> 51:33.480
There's a protocol.

51:33.704 --> 51:35.735
It's Bennett. He's insane.

51:36.550 --> 51:40.616
In case of a breach, they
release irradiated steam.

51:40.617 --> 51:43.872
Now I can't prove this,
and you can't prove it,

51:43.873 --> 51:46.477
these are clever,
clever fuckers, right?

51:47.760 --> 51:50.006
You're a cop. You've
got to help me.

51:50.007 --> 51:51.579
Yeah. Sure. Yeah,
I will help you.

51:51.580 --> 51:53.134
Just come with me.
Tell me the truth.

51:53.135 --> 51:54.452
We'll get you deposed
by a lawyer.

51:54.453 --> 51:57.278
No. I'm sorry, no.

51:57.759 --> 52:00.329
I like you, you're Emma's dad.

52:00.815 --> 52:02.386
But you have to go.

52:06.191 --> 52:09.284
Alright. You can always
change your mind.

52:10.469 --> 52:12.535
In the meantime,
here, this is yours.

52:14.337 --> 52:15.903
It's loaded.

52:19.240 --> 52:21.219
That's illegal in
Massachusetts.

52:21.796 --> 52:24.197
Everything is illegal
in Massachusetts.

56:41.748 --> 56:45.691
What does it feel like?
Hmm?

57:10.261 --> 57:12.314
<i>- Good evening, Senator.
- Good evening, glad to be here.</i>

57:12.315 --> 57:14.941
<i>Senator, two days ago you
gave a speech in which you</i>

57:14.976 --> 57:18.360
<i>criticized your colleague Senator
Stafford, for his position</i>

57:18.361 --> 57:20.376
<i>- We all have positions.
- But Senator...</i>

57:20.377 --> 57:23.822
<i>I think the American people
are asking, with good reason,</i>

57:23.823 --> 57:27.042
<i>whether the price they've paid
for their security is too high.</i>

57:27.043 --> 57:29.670
<i>With respect, that's an answer
one would expect, but how</i>

57:29.671 --> 57:32.010
<i>does it jibe, Senator, with
your support for secret</i>

57:32.011 --> 57:34.545
<i>research facilities in
Massachusetts?</i>

57:35.238 --> 57:37.699
<i>I'm curious about what
you just asked of me.</i>

57:37.700 --> 57:38.756
<i>If you're asking...</i>

57:39.507 --> 57:42.700
...about this administrations
failed policies...

57:42.735 --> 57:45.893
<i>Senator, what can you tell
me about Northmoor?</i>

57:45.894 --> 57:48.461
<i>I'm not familiar with the
business practices of...</i>

57:48.462 --> 57:50.815
<i>Their parent company is one
of your biggest donors.</i>

57:50.816 --> 57:53.013
<i>All I can say about my
donors is that they are</i>

57:53.014 --> 57:55.299
<i>completely vetted and
above board.</i>

57:55.300 --> 57:58.759
<i>Senator, there is a serious
and growing petition movement</i>

57:58.760 --> 58:02.342
<i>to ban military research and
development in Massachusetts.</i>

58:02.343 --> 58:06.394
<i>I understand that. But people
have to realize the importance</i>

58:06.395 --> 58:10.317
<i>of R&D of every kind to
Massachusetts economy.</i>

58:10.318 --> 58:13.700
<i>Now, to answer your questions
about some other stuff...</i>

58:13.734 --> 58:16.609
<i>I fully agree with his
desires to expand...</i>

58:46.316 --> 58:48.353
I never had kids.

58:49.061 --> 58:53.161
Maybe it's better not to have
had one than to see one die.

58:53.811 --> 58:55.133
No.

58:57.823 --> 59:00.529
It's worth everything
to have one.

59:03.192 --> 59:05.142
Public drinking is illegal
in Massachusetts.

59:05.143 --> 59:08.139
Everything is illegal
in Massachusetts.

59:08.140 --> 59:10.574
Payback for the tea party.

59:11.663 --> 59:13.514
You've ever had
wine before?

59:13.515 --> 59:15.690
Not with any pleasure.

59:15.691 --> 59:17.650
Besides, with you, I think I'd
have to switch glasses

59:17.651 --> 59:19.487
when you weren't looking.

59:24.627 --> 59:27.840
My daughter was irradiated.
I don’t know how exactly,

59:27.841 --> 59:30.292
but I think it was our
friends at Northmoor.

59:30.820 --> 59:33.115
Later she was gunned
down in my home.

59:33.116 --> 59:35.408
And I want to know what
you would think about that.

59:37.370 --> 59:39.240
I had a source that said the
Nightflower people were

59:39.241 --> 59:42.556
intentionally exposed to
radiation while in the tunnels,

59:42.557 --> 59:44.570
but that source is dead now.

59:45.115 --> 59:47.308
He wasn't a bad guy.

59:47.672 --> 59:48.920
No.

59:48.921 --> 59:51.436
Now you know
better than anyone

59:51.437 --> 59:53.512
cases like these
are never solved.

59:53.513 --> 59:56.709
Simply too complicated,
too much hard work.

59:57.445 --> 59:59.835
There is a lot going on
out there in this world.

01:00:00.259 --> 01:00:03.310
You just never can
connect "A" to "B".

01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:05.365
How do you know that?

01:00:05.366 --> 01:00:07.389
Because I'm usually the guy
that stops you connecting

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:08.425
"A" to "B".

01:00:08.426 --> 01:00:10.464
It's part of what I do.

01:00:17.695 --> 01:00:20.011
If I was an employee
at Northmoor,

01:00:20.465 --> 01:00:23.405
and I wanted to blow the
whistle on something...

01:00:23.406 --> 01:00:25.564
what would I be blowing
the whistle on?

01:00:25.565 --> 01:00:28.543
Let's take a walk and
we can talk about it.

01:00:28.774 --> 01:00:31.130
I'm not walking into
the dark with you.

01:00:31.704 --> 01:00:33.567
You're a wise man.

01:00:35.156 --> 01:00:38.859
- Are you on my side?
- That's hard to tell.

01:00:39.583 --> 01:00:42.376
Do you know the Scott
Fitzgerald thing about

01:00:42.377 --> 01:00:46.536
an artist who's a man with
opposing ideas in his head,

01:00:46.537 --> 01:00:48.733
and he believe in them
both simultaneously?

01:00:48.734 --> 01:00:50.197
Heard of it. Yeah.

01:00:50.198 --> 01:00:52.559
Well, that's sort of the
beginning of it.

01:00:55.653 --> 01:00:59.962
So what's that like? Not
being anyone in particular.

01:01:02.874 --> 01:01:06.540
I don't know what it means
to have lost a daughter.

01:01:06.541 --> 01:01:09.667
But I know what it means
never to have had one.

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:15.813
Yeah.

01:01:15.814 --> 01:01:17.668
Got nobody left
to bury you.

01:01:19.293 --> 01:01:20.622
Yeah.

01:01:31.966 --> 01:01:33.857
Oh and by the way...

01:01:33.858 --> 01:01:35.667
Thanks for not killing me.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:52.065
Detective Craven. How do
you feel about a suspect

01:01:52.066 --> 01:01:53.838
being identified?

01:01:56.597 --> 01:01:58.503
You're later than
everybody else.

01:01:59.065 --> 01:02:01.709
Is that because you
have a lousy boss?

01:02:04.359 --> 01:02:06.805
I'm so sorry for you.

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:08.594
I'm sorry I have
to be here.

01:02:08.935 --> 01:02:10.592
It's alright, take it easy.

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:12.902
You got a business
card or something?

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.570
Thanks.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.571
Look, go on home, honey.
It's too late to be out here.

01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:23.418
I'll call you, okay?

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.245
Mr. Sanderman?

01:02:44.759 --> 01:02:46.941
I'm sorry, I didn’t mean
to... I interrupted?

01:02:46.942 --> 01:02:48.678
- No.
- I'm Tomas Craven.

01:02:48.679 --> 01:02:50.627
Detective Tomas Craven,
Boston Police Department.

01:02:50.628 --> 01:02:52.017
I know who you are.

01:02:52.052 --> 01:02:55.225
- I'm sorry for your troubles.
- Thank you.

01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:58.080
I understand my daughter
was a client of yours?

01:02:58.081 --> 01:02:59.122
Yes.

01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:02.662
I mean no, we had a consultation,
she never formally became

01:03:02.663 --> 01:03:03.899
my client.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:05.673
Oh.

01:03:05.674 --> 01:03:07.290
It says in her phone
calendar that you and she

01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:09.480
had dinner on the
18th of last month.

01:03:10.193 --> 01:03:12.379
Yeah, I asked her
on a date, yes.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:16.601
- Well how did it go?
- Fine. Fine.

01:03:16.602 --> 01:03:19.277
She was a nice girl.

01:03:19.734 --> 01:03:21.326
Smart as a...

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:25.408
- Sorry, I have to go.
- I'll come with you.

01:03:26.793 --> 01:03:28.096
Can I ask you what
this is about?

01:03:28.097 --> 01:03:29.947
She came to your office.
She wanted to blow

01:03:29.948 --> 01:03:31.167
the whistle on something.

01:03:31.451 --> 01:03:32.775
You know where
that's from, right?

01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:34.543
When the cops used to
blow their whistles.

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:35.482
I can't talk about that.

01:03:35.483 --> 01:03:37.228
I don't want you
to talk about that.

01:03:37.263 --> 01:03:39.971
But then later that night you
invited her out for dinner.

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:42.636
Gee, you're really
nervous, Mr. Sanderman.

01:03:42.637 --> 01:03:44.706
You're about two seconds
away from telling me how

01:03:44.707 --> 01:03:46.248
inappropriate all this is.

01:03:46.686 --> 01:03:48.534
Let me say right off the bat,
I knew you couldn't represent

01:03:48.535 --> 01:03:50.861
her in a non-disclosure contract,
but you probably suggested

01:03:50.862 --> 01:03:52.939
some further discussion on the
matter over a nice plate of

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.521
spaghetti and meatballs.

01:03:54.851 --> 01:03:57.706
I think you had two agendas.
One, you wanted sex with her.

01:03:57.707 --> 01:03:59.665
Hey I'm not passing
judgment here okay,

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.960
and two, Mr. Sanderman, you
wanted to know more about

01:04:02.961 --> 01:04:04.663
what potential security
breach she represented.

01:04:04.664 --> 01:04:07.447
I have to get to a
deposition in Springfield.

01:04:22.742 --> 01:04:25.055
You represent Northmoor
in local matters.

01:04:25.056 --> 01:04:27.686
My daughter came to you, but
you're Northmoors attorney.

01:04:27.687 --> 01:04:29.267
This is a highly
irregular convers...

01:04:29.876 --> 01:04:31.298
...because senator Pine has
put your name before

01:04:31.299 --> 01:04:34.378
two different governors
for District Court Judge.

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.127
So you were about
to say something?

01:04:36.128 --> 01:04:38.639
I don't have anything to say
and you are out of your depth

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.895
and far from your
jurisdiction.

01:04:39.896 --> 01:04:41.807
You won't talk to me? I'm going
to the Global and the Herald.

01:04:41.808 --> 01:04:44.178
I'll tell them my daughter came
to talk to you about Northmoor.

01:04:44.179 --> 01:04:46.946
That you were Northmoors
attorney and failed to tell her.

01:04:46.947 --> 01:04:48.575
And then you'd be right in
the middle of a big ass story

01:04:48.576 --> 01:04:50.888
saying how my daughter
was the target and not me.

01:04:50.889 --> 01:04:51.933
Is that where you
want to be?

01:04:51.934 --> 01:04:53.646
On what evidence
would you say that?

01:04:53.647 --> 01:04:55.587
I'll forge your fucking
diary. I don't care.

01:04:55.588 --> 01:04:57.624
Getting you in trouble is
good enough for me.

01:04:57.659 --> 01:04:59.661
Listen, asshole, this is not
about police, okay?

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.908
This isn't about police and
arrest and all that nice shit,

01:05:01.909 --> 01:05:03.604
this is about me knowing what
I have to know and the fact

01:05:03.605 --> 01:05:04.961
that you got to tell me.

01:05:05.147 --> 01:05:07.185
Now I want to see
the Senator.

01:05:07.186 --> 01:05:10.007
See the Senator? Who the
fuck do you think you are?

01:05:10.042 --> 01:05:12.550
I'm the guy with nothing to
lose that doesn't give a shit.

01:05:12.551 --> 01:05:15.675
You tell him that. And fasten
your fucking seatbelt.

01:05:22.246 --> 01:05:24.764
<i>Look, Daddy.
Lots of ABCs</i>

01:05:33.893 --> 01:05:34.949
Hi.

01:05:36.615 --> 01:05:38.325
I want to go to
her apartment.

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:40.848
I want to see
her things.

01:05:41.996 --> 01:05:44.657
That's not a good
idea right now.

01:05:45.945 --> 01:05:47.223
I'm sorry.

01:05:48.273 --> 01:05:49.902
I'm so scared.

01:05:50.143 --> 01:05:52.820
Look. I would take you for
a cup of coffee some day,

01:05:52.821 --> 01:05:54.561
but we have to
just talk now.

01:05:54.562 --> 01:05:56.983
I'd like to ask you things about
her. Personal things maybe

01:05:56.984 --> 01:06:00.143
I never knew, but there's
no time now...

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.216
Look, honey, I can't
take this, okay?

01:06:04.217 --> 01:06:08.626
I... talk to me, okay?
Talk to me.

01:06:14.907 --> 01:06:19.531
- I introduced her to them.
- Introduced her to who, honey?

01:06:19.532 --> 01:06:21.284
Nightflower.

01:06:22.072 --> 01:06:23.768
Fuck, you know.

01:06:23.769 --> 01:06:25.925
Corporations this,
corporations that.

01:06:25.926 --> 01:06:27.477
Just keep it
straight, okay?

01:06:30.636 --> 01:06:32.430
They had a little
shack up the river.

01:06:32.946 --> 01:06:34.399
Nightflower.

01:06:35.177 --> 01:06:38.292
- I'm so afraid.
- Who are you afraid of?

01:06:40.307 --> 01:06:43.418
They came to my house.
These guys in black suits,

01:06:43.419 --> 01:06:46.136
asking about Emma,
I lied my ass off!

01:06:46.892 --> 01:06:48.400
What were they doing in
Northmoor that Emma

01:06:48.401 --> 01:06:50.181
wanted to expose?

01:06:50.182 --> 01:06:53.304
Bennett’s the motherfucker.
Alright? It's Bennett.

01:06:53.305 --> 01:06:55.805
That's all she wanted to say
at first. That he was insane.

01:06:55.806 --> 01:06:57.687
She realized he was
completely fucking insane.

01:06:57.688 --> 01:07:00.047
Okay, whether he was
this, that or whatever,

01:07:00.048 --> 01:07:01.378
What were they doing
at Northmoor?

01:07:01.379 --> 01:07:03.235
Why did Emma go to
Nightflower?

01:07:03.236 --> 01:07:05.675
Because she couldn't go to the
papers because of the contract.

01:07:05.676 --> 01:07:09.216
The Senator wouldn't help. You
are not hearing this from me.

01:07:09.217 --> 01:07:10.428
Alright, you are not.

01:07:10.429 --> 01:07:14.416
I run a luggage store.
I got a three year old.

01:07:14.417 --> 01:07:16.371
I'm not hearing this
from you.

01:07:17.163 --> 01:07:19.916
What did they do at Northmoor
that Emma wanted to expose?

01:07:27.776 --> 01:07:29.129
She had this for you.

01:07:29.706 --> 01:07:30.751
In case...

01:07:32.802 --> 01:07:34.596
I never wanted...

01:07:35.339 --> 01:07:37.009
I'm just a person.

01:07:37.238 --> 01:07:38.926
You know, I'm just
a fucking person.

01:07:38.927 --> 01:07:40.604
Okay. I know.

01:07:41.068 --> 01:07:43.300
Go back to your
baby, okay?

01:07:43.527 --> 01:07:45.074
I never saw you.

01:07:45.755 --> 01:07:47.867
Alright? Go on.

01:07:55.885 --> 01:07:58.245
I got to tell you
something else first.

01:07:58.246 --> 01:07:59.494
What?

01:08:03.866 --> 01:08:05.896
She thought they
poisoned her.

01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:18.060
You know...

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:21.893
I always liked
this town.

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:25.788
When she moved
out here...

01:08:26.022 --> 01:08:29.453
She said it reminded her
of Paris in the Twenties.

01:08:29.455 --> 01:08:32.814
We have a very traditional
home in Boston, and...

01:08:32.816 --> 01:08:36.682
maybe it wasn't what she
wanted out of life, you know?

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.192
What was the name of
her contact in Nightflower?

01:08:43.193 --> 01:08:44.776
Tell me that and
we're done.

01:08:46.194 --> 01:08:47.587
No, I'm done now.

01:08:47.859 --> 01:08:50.548
In her phone records it
was a guy called Robinson.

01:08:50.549 --> 01:08:52.483
Is that the guy?

01:08:53.767 --> 01:08:56.684
Yeah.
Now I'm done.

01:09:57.874 --> 01:09:59.486
We've stabilized her.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:03.097
She's in a coma, although we
weren't able to save her leg.

01:10:06.467 --> 01:10:08.015
She has a child, is there
anybody who could...

01:10:08.016 --> 01:10:10.208
Her parents just arrived.

01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:12.056
Thanks.

01:10:20.438 --> 01:10:23.498
Go ahead. I'll
keep you posted.

01:10:25.076 --> 01:10:26.551
Thanks.

01:11:07.916 --> 01:11:11.134
<i>My name is Emma
Charlotte Craven.</i>

01:11:11.135 --> 01:11:13.159
<i>I work at Northmoor,
Massachusetts,</i>

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.941
<i>as a research assistant.</i>

01:11:14.942 --> 01:11:17.158
<i>I know that I am violating
the security conditions</i>

01:11:17.159 --> 01:11:21.135
<i>of my workplace, and I
know I am committing a crime.</i>

01:11:21.136 --> 01:11:24.581
<i>But I'm doing this because I've
exhausted every legal avenue</i>

01:11:24.582 --> 01:11:27.604
<i>that is available to me,
and no one would listen.</i>

01:11:27.605 --> 01:11:30.412
<i>So, now I have to
do what's right.</i>

01:11:30.413 --> 01:11:32.541
<i>Northmoor is
breaking the law.</i>

01:11:32.542 --> 01:11:34.597
<i>They are making
nuclear weapons.</i>

01:11:34.598 --> 01:11:36.372
<i>But these are not US
nuclear weapons,</i>

01:11:36.373 --> 01:11:39.495
<i>they are weapons designed
to foreign specification</i>

01:11:39.496 --> 01:11:41.445
<i>and built with
foreign materials.</i>

01:11:41.446 --> 01:11:44.499
<i>So, obviously, if these
bombs were ever used,</i>

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.682
<i>they would be traced
back to another country,</i>

01:11:46.683 --> 01:11:48.505
<i>and not the US.</i>

01:11:48.506 --> 01:11:53.645
<i>I've stolen documents,
images, blueprints.</i>

01:11:53.646 --> 01:11:56.067
<i>But we need proof of
the weapons themselves,</i>

01:11:56.068 --> 01:11:59.464
<i>so I'm showing a team
of people how to get into</i>

01:11:59.465 --> 01:12:02.900
<i>the Northmoor facility
to video the evidence.</i>

01:12:04.132 --> 01:12:07.785
<i>I'm recoding all this
because I'm very scared.</i>

01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:09.954
<i>I'm under constant
surveillance.</i>

01:12:09.955 --> 01:12:13.204
<i>My phone is tapped
and I'm being followed.</i>

01:12:13.205 --> 01:12:18.322
<i>So chances are that if you're
watching this I'm already dead.</i>

01:12:19.273 --> 01:12:20.590
<i>I...</i>

01:12:20.591 --> 01:12:22.127
<i>I love you, dad.</i>

01:12:31.464 --> 01:12:32.959
Fuck

01:13:36.314 --> 01:13:38.440
If another contractor asks
to run his own security,

01:13:38.441 --> 01:13:39.532
What should I say?

01:13:39.533 --> 01:13:41.725
I suppose that
would be up to you.

01:13:42.526 --> 01:13:45.277
This is called a containment
situation. I wonder why, really.

01:13:45.278 --> 01:13:47.343
The problem is that there
are things uncontained

01:13:47.344 --> 01:13:49.375
and some of them will
never get back in the box.

01:13:49.376 --> 01:13:51.438
You're scared about
Craven. Very wisely so.

01:13:51.439 --> 01:13:53.952
But here is the damage
control analysis:

01:13:53.953 --> 01:13:56.540
Apart from Craven, three sets
of parents have lost their kids.

01:13:56.541 --> 01:13:59.224
Now you have an employee
who tries to run over

01:13:59.225 --> 01:14:01.326
a single mother, only to be
shot in the head by the

01:14:01.327 --> 01:14:03.069
same cop that you
previously bereaved.

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:04.417
I don't know what you're
talking about, and surely

01:14:04.418 --> 01:14:05.189
you're not saying it.

01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:06.429
Do you know what the thing
is about the dead, Bennett?

01:14:06.464 --> 01:14:11.225
They have got lovers, friends,
relatives, a billion loose ends.

01:14:11.226 --> 01:14:13.013
Let’s start at the beginning
of this debacle.

01:14:13.014 --> 01:14:16.469
Nightflower is a pack of paranoid
anti-corporate freaks.

01:14:18.893 --> 01:14:22.240
You think three of their people
drowned is going to read

01:14:22.275 --> 01:14:23.715
as an accident?

01:14:23.716 --> 01:14:25.371
It was an accident.

01:14:25.372 --> 01:14:27.596
And the man involved in the
other incident was a Bosnian,

01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:30.132
who as far as the paperwork
is considered is live and well

01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:32.370
in London, at this
very moment.

01:14:32.821 --> 01:14:36.647
You can do my job, it seems
I can also do yours.

01:14:36.648 --> 01:14:38.750
What you're doing
is not my job.

01:14:39.227 --> 01:14:40.467
Isn't it?

01:14:40.468 --> 01:14:42.914
Look, even if the drownings
were accidental, the Nightflower

01:14:42.915 --> 01:14:45.901
bodies were recovered by a
radiation team and disposed of.

01:14:45.902 --> 01:14:47.840
- By your people, not mine.
- You told my office they were

01:14:47.841 --> 01:14:50.283
contaminated terrorists, not that
they were American citizens

01:14:50.284 --> 01:14:52.757
that you had contaminated.
One of them is the only child

01:14:52.758 --> 01:14:54.849
of a mother with
multiple sclerosis.

01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:57.338
When she's on TV, saying:
"The last thing I knew, they

01:14:57.339 --> 01:15:00.528
were breaking into Northmoor",
do you know what I’m saying?

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:03.061
Do you understand what
you have done?

01:15:03.062 --> 01:15:07.179
What's worse, me doing it,
or you covering it up?

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.691
I'm just a private individual,
a citizen, a man.

01:15:09.692 --> 01:15:13.157
You on the other hand
are the US government.

01:15:13.846 --> 01:15:15.893
What I am is the guy whose
only fuckup was letting you

01:15:15.894 --> 01:15:18.245
have your own
security fiefdom.

01:15:19.907 --> 01:15:22.084
Whatever they say,
there was never a break.

01:15:22.085 --> 01:15:24.049
Northmoor has never
had a security breach,

01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:25.499
Northmoor has never
had an accident

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:29.138
and Northmoor does
not make weapons.

01:15:29.139 --> 01:15:32.177
Least of all things supposed
in certain contingencies

01:15:32.178 --> 01:15:36.525
best known to you to look
like jihadist dirty bombs.

01:15:37.441 --> 01:15:40.388
I wouldn't worry
about it more.

01:15:40.389 --> 01:15:45.536
"Fuck you, it's classified", still
works as far as I’m concerned.

01:15:51.825 --> 01:15:53.226
Are you even here,
Mr. Bennett?

01:15:53.227 --> 01:15:55.715
Are we even talking?
I'm at my house in Virginia.

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:57.758
I've got food poisoning.
Where are you?

01:15:57.759 --> 01:15:59.779
Oh, I'm not here.

01:16:00.893 --> 01:16:03.806
Is Robinson keeping
his part of the bargain?

01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:14.286
- Mr. Robinson?
- Yes.

01:16:14.287 --> 01:16:17.201
- Mr. Allison Robinson Jr?
- Yes.

01:16:17.202 --> 01:16:19.979
Could you remove the
glasses please, Sir?

01:16:29.646 --> 01:16:32.521
My daughter was Emma Craven.
She wasn't killed in your

01:16:32.522 --> 01:16:35.194
amphibious little operation
against the corporate Satan.

01:16:35.195 --> 01:16:38.470
She was killed later!
On my front porch!

01:16:38.471 --> 01:16:39.815
Come here!

01:16:40.909 --> 01:16:43.722
I want to know why you, with
your concerns for the planet

01:16:43.723 --> 01:16:45.761
and the human race stayed
silent about the drowning

01:16:45.762 --> 01:16:48.324
deaths of your people.
Why is that?

01:16:48.581 --> 01:16:50.253
People with families.

01:16:50.254 --> 01:16:51.908
All of them had kids.

01:16:51.909 --> 01:16:53.804
And one of them
was my daughter.

01:16:55.024 --> 01:16:57.488
I'm not going to
hit you again.

01:16:59.216 --> 01:17:03.636
And she's not here because
of you. You son of a bitch!

01:17:07.647 --> 01:17:10.641
Now you got a serious
situation here Mr. Robinson.

01:17:12.004 --> 01:17:13.558
See they know who you
are, and you're not dead.

01:17:13.559 --> 01:17:16.526
You're not dead, shot,
hurt, poisoned, nothing.

01:17:16.527 --> 01:17:18.870
Now I figure that's
because you cut a deal.

01:17:18.871 --> 01:17:20.872
You're going to cut
another deal with me.

01:17:21.705 --> 01:17:23.143
You're going to
tell me everything.

01:17:23.144 --> 01:17:24.995
- Come on, you scum.
- No!

01:17:55.195 --> 01:17:57.204
I need to know something
about the properties of the

01:17:57.205 --> 01:17:59.506
substance you gave
Emma Craven.

01:17:59.507 --> 01:18:01.662
I would rather not discuss
it in those terms.

01:18:01.822 --> 01:18:05.337
Is it something she could have
encountered in her work?

01:18:05.338 --> 01:18:08.257
Any exposure, if there were
an exposure, would be consistent

01:18:08.258 --> 01:18:11.789
with a documentable, procedural
failure on her part.

01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:14.728
Is it something that could
have remained in her effects

01:18:14.729 --> 01:18:16.507
and been transferred to her
father without much

01:18:16.508 --> 01:18:18.624
collateral contamination?

01:18:18.659 --> 01:18:22.199
Do you mean could it have
poisoned her father as well?

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.280
Yes.

01:18:26.123 --> 01:18:28.477
What, in your opinion, would
be the consequences if

01:18:28.478 --> 01:18:30.563
Craven opens his mouth?

01:18:33.696 --> 01:18:36.280
It's unsurviveable.

01:18:39.877 --> 01:18:41.762
So be it, then.

01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:49.704
Do you see a
soul in there?

01:18:49.705 --> 01:18:51.665
I beg your pardon?

01:18:52.819 --> 01:18:54.338
You can button
your shirt.

01:18:54.339 --> 01:18:56.413
You know, as we discussed
yesterday, there will be

01:18:56.448 --> 01:18:58.350
some erratic behavior.

01:18:58.351 --> 01:19:02.220
And I regret to say this probably
means you will have less time.

01:19:02.221 --> 01:19:04.219
I know what it means.

01:19:07.153 --> 01:19:09.835
I've been having
aural hallucinations.

01:19:09.836 --> 01:19:12.944
My father's voice calling
my name as I start to sleep.

01:19:14.324 --> 01:19:16.285
Bastard's been dead for
forty years and suddenly

01:19:16.286 --> 01:19:17.993
he's yelling at me again.

01:19:18.347 --> 01:19:20.985
- I come awake.
- You're not sleeping?

01:19:20.986 --> 01:19:24.288
No, I'm not sleeping, I start
to sleep, then I jolt awake.

01:19:25.869 --> 01:19:29.747
There's something
about the darkness.

01:19:29.748 --> 01:19:32.870
- I don't like it.
- I'm not a counselor.

01:19:32.871 --> 01:19:35.355
I know you want to banter
with me. I don't do that.

01:19:35.356 --> 01:19:39.983
- I can only give you the facts.
- We all know what the facts are.

01:19:40.667 --> 01:19:44.624
We live a while, and then we
die sooner than we planned.

01:19:53.158 --> 01:19:54.562
Standard procedure
with the Senator.

01:19:54.563 --> 01:19:56.318
Yeah, I get it.

01:19:57.037 --> 01:19:59.991
You know you didn't really
let the side stand with you.

01:19:59.992 --> 01:20:01.779
You got a lot of
brothers out there.

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:04.494
Yeah, I know. But I
like a private funeral.

01:20:04.898 --> 01:20:07.341
Senator gets in his moods.
Not too good today.

01:20:07.342 --> 01:20:10.172
That's too bad. I was
jumping for joy.

01:20:15.195 --> 01:20:19.461
Are you hungry? We have
some sandwiches, a cup of tea?

01:20:20.206 --> 01:20:21.778
No thank you, Sir.

01:20:21.779 --> 01:20:25.692
Well, it's always a pleasure
to meet a combat veteran.

01:20:25.693 --> 01:20:29.463
You left as a master sergeant
of a heavy weapons platoon.

01:20:29.464 --> 01:20:30.419
Yes, Sir.

01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:35.129
- How did you do that at 20?
- Everybody else was dead.

01:20:37.761 --> 01:20:40.229
Did you have trouble adjusting
when you came home?

01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:42.054
- No.
- Really?

01:20:42.055 --> 01:20:45.488
No. People talk about
trauma and so forth.

01:20:45.489 --> 01:20:48.441
I figure you come out of
combat the way you went in.

01:20:48.442 --> 01:20:50.225
I know that's not a very
kind thing to say, but

01:20:50.226 --> 01:20:52.105
that's my observation.

01:20:52.394 --> 01:20:54.714
And I know there's a lot of
big bucks in this post traumatic

01:20:54.715 --> 01:20:59.519
stress thing. But combat is
pretty much like anything else.

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.562
It helps put perspective on things
when you're scared shitless.

01:21:02.563 --> 01:21:05.150
What is the nature of our
appointment, Detective Craven?

01:21:05.151 --> 01:21:07.309
Well I was hoping that
you could tell me that.

01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:10.284
Why am I supposed to tell you
what you want to see me about?

01:21:10.285 --> 01:21:12.767
Well, because you're seeing me
in less than 48 hours after

01:21:12.802 --> 01:21:14.699
I talked to your attorney.

01:21:16.626 --> 01:21:20.985
Your daughter came to me with
allegations about Northmoor.

01:21:20.986 --> 01:21:24.568
- She sent me a letter.
- What did the letter contain?

01:21:24.569 --> 01:21:28.246
It touched on national security
matters that are classified.

01:21:30.026 --> 01:21:34.012
- What happened to the letter?
- That is also classified.

01:21:34.013 --> 01:21:38.213
But protocol would be to turn
it over to the committee that

01:21:38.214 --> 01:21:41.740
does oversight on the area your
daughters letter touched upon.

01:21:41.741 --> 01:21:43.851
Prompting an investigation
on my daughter.

01:21:43.852 --> 01:21:46.566
Opening up a DARPA file on her.
Treating her like a terrorist?

01:21:46.567 --> 01:21:49.624
I'm not involved in
security matters.

01:21:49.625 --> 01:21:52.943
I did write your daughter,
advising her she might be

01:21:52.944 --> 01:21:54.594
in breach of security.

01:21:54.595 --> 01:21:58.178
Oh. So you didn't help her?

01:21:58.939 --> 01:22:01.675
I'm glad to see you, Detective.
As both a veteran and as

01:22:01.676 --> 01:22:04.310
a police officer of your many
years of service, but I have

01:22:04.311 --> 01:22:07.120
to tell you that your daughter,
and we have to say this despite

01:22:07.121 --> 01:22:12.211
her terrible accident,
was in violation of...

01:22:12.212 --> 01:22:14.522
almost everything of which
she could be in violation.

01:22:14.523 --> 01:22:17.472
- What did she allege?
- That's classified.

01:22:18.627 --> 01:22:20.920
You know, Detective, a very
important part of Massachusetts

01:22:20.921 --> 01:22:22.923
economy is research and
development...

01:22:22.924 --> 01:22:27.642
Senator. I think you're in a
position regarding Northmoor,

01:22:27.643 --> 01:22:30.230
where you had better decide
if you're hanging on the cross

01:22:30.231 --> 01:22:33.805
or banging in the nails.
Here.

01:22:36.021 --> 01:22:38.886
These deaths are the result
of a conspiracy by one of your

01:22:38.887 --> 01:22:41.297
major campaign contributors.

01:22:42.474 --> 01:22:44.600
Why do you include your daughter?
Her death was an accident.

01:22:44.601 --> 01:22:48.110
No. She was poisoned with
cesium by Mr. Bennett.

01:22:49.975 --> 01:22:52.604
I think I'm scaring you Senator.
There's probably not too much

01:22:52.605 --> 01:22:56.062
upside to scaring a Senator, except
to provide some perspective.

01:22:56.268 --> 01:22:58.228
I'm going to go now, but I'm
going to leave you these pictures

01:22:58.229 --> 01:23:00.479
I want you to call everybody
involved, everybody concerned,

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.675
and tell them I know everything
I need to know to throw a

01:23:02.676 --> 01:23:04.679
real box of Tarantulas
into this situation.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.675
- If you have info...
- Shut up!

01:23:05.676 --> 01:23:07.840
I'm not interested in
talking any more shit.

01:23:07.841 --> 01:23:09.801
You investigate this
at a national level.

01:23:09.802 --> 01:23:11.909
You do that, maybe you'll
come out of this alright.

01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:13.132
I don't know.

01:23:14.049 --> 01:23:15.342
I don't think you knew
that the people you are

01:23:15.343 --> 01:23:16.783
in business with
killed my daughter.

01:23:17.728 --> 01:23:19.551
But now that you do know...

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:21.879
what are you going
to do about it?

01:23:22.085 --> 01:23:23.831
Good afternoon, Senator.

01:24:40.772 --> 01:24:42.654
Get out of the vehicle.

01:24:44.359 --> 01:24:46.428
What the fuck do you
think you just did?

01:24:46.429 --> 01:24:48.423
You just rear-ended an
unmarked cruiser, and I

01:24:48.424 --> 01:24:50.309
made an observation
that you are armed.

01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:51.739
Through smoked glass
and our coats?

01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:53.358
Yeah, I'm funny
that way.

01:24:53.512 --> 01:24:55.416
Get out of the car, now.
Or you're going to make

01:24:55.417 --> 01:24:56.928
a move for something on
the inside of your jackets,

01:24:56.929 --> 01:24:58.465
you understand me?

01:24:59.649 --> 01:25:01.304
Get out of the car.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.752
Alright. On your knees,
hands on your heads.

01:25:14.082 --> 01:25:15.762
- What have you got, Tom?
- These guys are armed.

01:25:15.763 --> 01:25:18.398
They were following me.
Rear-ended my car.

01:25:19.179 --> 01:25:22.281
Got some ID then?
Thanks.

01:25:25.675 --> 01:25:28.123
Not in law enforcement.
Imagine that.

01:25:29.494 --> 01:25:30.185
What are you?

01:25:30.474 --> 01:25:32.281
You don't think this is going
to get straightened out?

01:25:32.282 --> 01:25:33.828
Not for a while.

01:25:33.829 --> 01:25:36.114
These fuckers got
automatic weapons.

01:25:36.754 --> 01:25:39.413
You just made
a serious mistake.

01:25:43.095 --> 01:25:46.020
Did you shoot
my daughter?

01:25:47.629 --> 01:25:51.761
I'm the supposed target of a
killer. So you here, following me

01:25:51.762 --> 01:25:54.195
armed, with no credentials
in the city of Boston,

01:25:54.196 --> 01:25:56.184
you're out of your
fucking mind.

01:25:57.265 --> 01:25:59.237
Welcome to hell.

01:26:00.037 --> 01:26:02.677
<i>A strange new twist
in the Emma Craven case,</i>

01:26:02.678 --> 01:26:05.329
<i>a suspect has been
identified as her murderer,</i>

01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:08.353
<i>but new developments
today involving her father</i>

01:26:08.354 --> 01:26:10.861
<i>Two men have been arrested
in Boston. Police say</i>

01:26:10.862 --> 01:26:13.387
<i>the men were taken into
custody after their car</i>

01:26:13.388 --> 01:26:16.041
<i>crashed into the back
of an unmarked police car,</i>

01:26:16.042 --> 01:26:18.387
<i>driven by Boston Police
Detective Tomas Craven,</i>

01:26:18.388 --> 01:26:19.986
<i>the father of Emma Craven.</i>

01:26:19.987 --> 01:26:22.467
<i>This all happened on
Marlinton Street...</i>

01:26:29.044 --> 01:26:31.937
- Bennett.
- We need to abort right now.

01:26:31.938 --> 01:26:33.862
<i>We can't risk killing
Tom Craven yet.</i>

01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:35.699
It's too late.

01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:37.829
It's already been done.

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:01.343
You want to try?

01:27:08.078 --> 01:27:08.900
Hold your hair back,
your mother will

01:27:08.901 --> 01:27:10.974
kill me if I get it all
messed up again.

01:27:10.975 --> 01:27:12.296
There you go.

01:27:18.887 --> 01:27:24.003
Perfect. Now a razor. Here
you go. Don't cut yourself.

01:27:24.004 --> 01:27:26.934
- Comb?
- That will work.

01:27:27.901 --> 01:27:29.053
Now watch.

01:27:47.055 --> 01:27:48.594
Painless.

01:27:48.595 --> 01:27:51.874
Wash it off.
One more.

01:28:36.211 --> 01:28:37.904
Can I come in, Tom?

01:28:40.841 --> 01:28:42.829
- You alright?
- Yeah.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.972
Do you remember when the
trooper out at the airport

01:29:03.973 --> 01:29:08.267
busted Whitey? He got
demoted and transferred.

01:29:10.737 --> 01:29:14.340
He knew what was going on.
But he couldn't prove it.

01:29:14.341 --> 01:29:16.603
And nobody wanted to
know about it.

01:29:17.246 --> 01:29:20.076
And finally he shot
himself, remember that?

01:29:22.775 --> 01:29:25.199
I don't think you'd
shoot yourself.

01:29:27.168 --> 01:29:29.553
But what's coming
is worse than that.

01:29:31.173 --> 01:29:35.779
It isn't what it is, Tommy.
It is never what it is.

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:39.008
It is what it can be
made to look like.

01:29:41.383 --> 01:29:44.418
There's a DA in Hampshire
County, going to charge you

01:29:44.419 --> 01:29:47.126
with the death of your
daughters boyfriend.

01:29:47.416 --> 01:29:50.856
He doesn't have a case.
But that doesn't matter.

01:29:52.636 --> 01:29:56.139
It'll be five years of
people thinking you did it.

01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:58.199
You'll go broke,
you'll lose the house.

01:29:58.527 --> 01:30:00.257
And they go after
your pension.

01:30:00.258 --> 01:30:04.153
If you win the case
there'll be a civil suite

01:30:04.188 --> 01:30:05.897
by that point you won't
be able to afford a lawyer.

01:30:05.898 --> 01:30:08.155
What are they
offering you?

01:30:13.841 --> 01:30:15.992
I got kids, Tommy.

01:30:18.092 --> 01:30:19.349
I don't.

01:30:23.477 --> 01:30:25.959
But even if you did, right?

01:30:28.557 --> 01:30:32.241
- Even if you did.
- Yup. Even if I did.

01:31:21.934 --> 01:31:26.800
You know, Bill. No one
expects you to be perfect.

01:31:28.156 --> 01:31:31.414
But there's a few basic
things you got to get right.

01:31:33.723 --> 01:31:36.265
Always do the best you
can by your family,

01:31:36.266 --> 01:31:39.286
go to work every day,
always speak your mind.

01:31:39.287 --> 01:31:41.939
Never hurt anyone that
doesn't deserve it.

01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:45.660
Never take anything
from the bad guys.

01:31:47.292 --> 01:31:51.027
It's all. It's not
much to ask.

01:32:01.906 --> 01:32:03.255
Hello, Craven.

01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:01.258
I need your car.

01:34:39.455 --> 01:34:40.916
Not yet.

01:35:01.938 --> 01:35:03.186
Go ahead.

01:35:05.562 --> 01:35:06.811
Hold on.

01:35:10.022 --> 01:35:11.270
I'll call you back.

01:35:20.769 --> 01:35:22.017
Derek?

01:35:22.305 --> 01:35:23.553
Derek?

01:35:29.281 --> 01:35:30.529
Shit.

01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:33.717
You're all fucked
up, Craven.

01:35:34.331 --> 01:35:35.611
You're all done.

01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:37.275
Sit down.

01:35:37.276 --> 01:35:39.038
Lie down.

01:35:39.039 --> 01:35:40.287
Be dead.

01:35:43.421 --> 01:35:44.615
Fuck.

01:35:46.368 --> 01:35:48.637
- Say "Craven".
- Fuck you.

01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:53.347
- You fuck.
- "Craven". Say it.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.630
- Craven.
- Louder!

01:35:56.015 --> 01:35:57.264
- Craven!
- LOUDER!

01:35:57.546 --> 01:35:58.801
CRAVEN!

01:36:16.977 --> 01:36:18.618
I'm sorry you had
to see that, honey.

01:37:23.552 --> 01:37:26.014
Deep down...

01:37:26.749 --> 01:37:29.289
You know you
deserve this.

01:37:59.882 --> 01:38:02.012
We've got a cop of almost
30 years spotless service

01:38:02.013 --> 01:38:04.657
and there's not one person,
on our side, who can explain

01:38:04.692 --> 01:38:07.302
his instability without lying,
who has executed the director

01:38:07.303 --> 01:38:10.597
of a nuclear research facility
where his daughter worked.

01:38:11.706 --> 01:38:14.605
Okay. Ideas?

01:38:20.981 --> 01:38:23.320
Your scenario is this.

01:38:23.614 --> 01:38:26.952
He was accidently
poisoned by his daughter.

01:38:30.010 --> 01:38:32.816
- But he blamed Bennett.
- How do we know that?

01:38:32.817 --> 01:38:37.230
Testimony of an altercation at
Northmoor when he was there.

01:38:37.231 --> 01:38:38.864
Testimony from the Senator.

01:38:38.865 --> 01:38:42.116
I can easily testify that he was
unstable. He came to my house.

01:38:42.117 --> 01:38:46.421
That's right. He made wild
allegations. He was armed.

01:38:46.422 --> 01:38:48.775
You know, you were
very lucky to live.

01:38:48.776 --> 01:38:50.451
That's true.
That's very true.

01:38:50.452 --> 01:38:53.161
Now the real story
here gentlemen, is:

01:38:53.162 --> 01:38:56.810
"United States Senator
escapes assassination."

01:38:56.845 --> 01:38:58.464
- That's right.
- That's the lead story.

01:38:58.465 --> 01:39:00.107
That will wipe the rest of
it right out of the media.

01:39:00.108 --> 01:39:02.302
Anyone who looks
at the rest of this

01:39:02.303 --> 01:39:04.825
is going to see that
something happened.

01:39:04.826 --> 01:39:07.233
But no one is going to be
able to figure it out.

01:39:07.234 --> 01:39:08.796
That's your objective.

01:39:08.797 --> 01:39:12.755
To make it so convoluted that
anyone can have a theory.

01:39:12.756 --> 01:39:16.172
- But no one’s got the facts.
- That's quite good, Jedburgh.

01:39:16.173 --> 01:39:20.238
Senator, I've been making things
unintelligible for 30 years.

01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:24.495
And by the way, its
Captain Jedburgh to you.

01:39:24.976 --> 01:39:27.781
Captain. Of what?

01:39:30.357 --> 01:39:32.273
Very little he can
tell you about.

01:39:35.056 --> 01:39:38.265
Right. Well. Seems we
have a good starting point.

01:39:38.266 --> 01:39:40.423
What's the prognosis
on Craven?

01:39:40.424 --> 01:39:44.508
- Well, you know he's terminal.
- We're all terminal, Millroy.

01:39:44.509 --> 01:39:46.506
Even middle management.

01:39:46.507 --> 01:39:48.242
But how fast is
he being terminal?

01:39:48.243 --> 01:39:51.492
- He's incapable of speech.
- Thank God for that.

01:39:57.365 --> 01:39:59.724
I understand you had a chance
to terminate Detective Craven

01:39:59.725 --> 01:40:01.433
and did not do so.

01:40:01.703 --> 01:40:06.891
You come to me. I look
at things. I decide.

01:40:06.892 --> 01:40:10.143
Jedburgh, we've got to get
the Senator out to the press.

01:40:12.887 --> 01:40:15.243
I've decided what
this country is.

01:40:16.018 --> 01:40:17.059
What?

01:40:18.214 --> 01:40:21.398
People, who
deserve better.

01:40:22.459 --> 01:40:25.649
We all appreciate Captain Jedburgh.
Yet we would have not got

01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:28.819
to this extremity had he done what
the situation clearly dictated.

01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:31.902
Senator, I don’t think you
really understand what side

01:40:31.903 --> 01:40:34.039
of this situation you're on.

01:40:39.898 --> 01:40:42.207
Well, I think we've had
a successful meeting...

01:40:49.183 --> 01:40:50.960
I...

01:40:50.961 --> 01:40:53.994
am a United
States Senator.

01:40:54.614 --> 01:40:55.930
By what standards?

01:41:09.064 --> 01:41:12.274
- You got a family?
- Yeah.

01:41:12.647 --> 01:41:14.916
- Kids?
- Yeah.
