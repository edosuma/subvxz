[instrumental music]

00:09.458 --> 00:10.583
(Zack)
'Ouch.'

00:10.667 --> 00:11.917
'I'm telling you, I can't take'

00:12.000 --> 00:12.917
'much more of this.'

00:13.000 --> 00:14.917
Just a little longer.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.125
It is necessary.

00:16.208 --> 00:18.583
Yeah, says who?

00:18.667 --> 00:21.417
'Mr. Allan, you are now
the head of security.'

00:21.500 --> 00:22.875
The rest of the command staff

00:22.958 --> 00:25.375
accepted Delenn's gift
of these new uniforms.

00:25.458 --> 00:26.708
Do you not wish to fit in?

00:26.792 --> 00:28.917
Oh, I never have before,
why should I start now.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.125
Besides, this stuff itches.
What-what is this, anyway?

00:32.208 --> 00:35.083
The fabrics all have different
names and purposes.

00:35.167 --> 00:37.583
The stitching on the center
panel is Zerka thread.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.500
It's very difficult to obtain.

00:39.583 --> 00:42.500
It's grown on a few small
ceremonial plants in Minbar.

00:42.583 --> 00:43.875
It still itches.

00:43.958 --> 00:45.833
It is an honor
to wear Zerka fabric.

00:45.917 --> 00:49.583
Well, it doesn't sit right
on my shoulders. Here, look.

00:49.667 --> 00:50.708
It looks fine.

00:50.792 --> 00:52.292
Oh, yeah, I should listen

00:52.375 --> 00:54.042
to a Minbari about fashion.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.875
[Zack chuckles]

00:55.958 --> 00:57.792
'I mean, robes, hoods.'

00:57.875 --> 00:59.167
I mean, no offense, but..

00:59.250 --> 01:01.500
...I've seen Vorlons
with more fashion sense.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.250
Ouch, hey!

01:05.542 --> 01:07.208
She did that on purpose.

01:07.292 --> 01:10.417
Yes, I believe she did.
I will deal with this.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.583
[speaking in Minbari]

01:17.417 --> 01:19.500
Yeah, and don't you forget it.

01:19.583 --> 01:22.125
Mr. Allan, if I may observe.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.167
Your problem
with the new uniform

01:26.250 --> 01:28.417
is not the new uniform, is it?

01:28.500 --> 01:31.917
Eh, I don't know.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.500
I just feel like
if I take his uniform

01:34.583 --> 01:37.708
I'm admitting the chief's
never coming back to his job.

01:37.792 --> 01:39.333
And I wish I could wait
a little longer.

01:39.417 --> 01:41.125
But the captain says,
it's important for things

01:41.208 --> 01:42.917
to get back to normal,
but that won't happen

01:43.000 --> 01:45.250
until the chief's
back where he belongs.

01:45.333 --> 01:48.792
And if Mr. Garibaldi
does not take back his job?

01:48.875 --> 01:52.250
He will.
He will.

01:53.625 --> 01:56.208
[instrumental music]

02:04.583 --> 02:06.542
Delenn.

02:06.625 --> 02:08.792
Are you ready to leave?

02:08.875 --> 02:10.375
I, uh..

02:10.458 --> 02:13.375
...I wish to request
another day.

02:13.458 --> 02:15.333
I need to be with John
for a little while

02:15.417 --> 02:18.542
when we are not both,
distracted and occupied.

02:18.625 --> 02:20.625
Will you tell him
you're leaving?

02:20.708 --> 02:21.917
Yes.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.458
But not why.

02:23.542 --> 02:26.042
That is, of course,
your decision

02:26.125 --> 02:27.875
but were I in your position

02:27.958 --> 02:30.375
I would tell Sheridan the truth.

02:30.458 --> 02:33.917
He should know that if
the dreaming does not go well

02:34.000 --> 02:36.958
you will not be allowed
to return to him.

02:46.292 --> 02:49.125
[instrumental music]

02:49.208 --> 02:51.333
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

02:51.417 --> 02:53.125
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

02:53.208 --> 02:55.792
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.958
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

02:58.042 --> 03:00.125
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

03:00.208 --> 03:01.917
(Marcus)
The year of pain..

03:02.000 --> 03:03.667
(Delenn)
And the year of joy.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.375
(Londo)
It was a new age.

03:05.458 --> 03:07.250
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.875
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.292
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.

03:15.375 --> 03:16.583
The place..

03:16.667 --> 03:18.250
(Sheridan)
Babylon 5.

03:18.333 --> 03:21.375
[theme music]

03:48.458 --> 03:51.500
[music continues]

04:15.042 --> 04:17.208
[instrumental music]

04:20.667 --> 04:21.750
[machine beeps]

04:21.833 --> 04:23.042
- Ivanova here.
- 'Commander.'

04:23.125 --> 04:24.667
(female #1)
'Maintenance wants to know when'

04:24.750 --> 04:26.250
'you can meet with them about
equipment shortages.'

04:26.333 --> 04:27.833
Um, tell them we'll
have to do it tomorrow.

04:27.917 --> 04:30.833
The Drazi ambassador invited me
to some religious festival.

04:30.917 --> 04:33.500
It's supposed to be a hell
of a party. I'm on my way now.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.958
Nice and easy now.

04:39.042 --> 04:41.083
Nice and easy.

04:42.458 --> 04:43.708
There we go.

04:45.042 --> 04:46.500
Local anesthetic
still holding out?

04:46.583 --> 04:48.458
Mm-hm, more or less.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.542
I think I've got It.

04:53.625 --> 04:56.125
Just as long as
it isn't in backwards.

04:56.208 --> 05:00.542
I've peered into my own soul
more than enough lately.

05:00.625 --> 05:02.292
Alright, I need you to

05:02.375 --> 05:04.792
close both your eyes
for a moment

05:04.875 --> 05:06.958
and open them slowly
when I tell you.

05:08.167 --> 05:09.542
I'm going to lower
the lights now

05:09.625 --> 05:11.875
so don't worry if you
can't see much at first.

05:13.125 --> 05:15.458
Now I'm activating
the prosthetic eye.

05:15.542 --> 05:17.125
Aah! Ohh!

05:17.208 --> 05:18.625
Are you alright?

05:18.708 --> 05:20.750
It burned for a moment.

05:20.833 --> 05:22.667
That's the last relay
cutting into place

05:22.750 --> 05:24.208
should be the worst of it.

05:24.292 --> 05:25.208
'Oh.'

05:25.292 --> 05:26.333
Now..

05:26.417 --> 05:27.875
...open your eyes.

05:27.958 --> 05:29.583
'Slowly.'

05:30.500 --> 05:33.167
'Take your time.'

05:33.250 --> 05:35.167
'That's it.'

05:35.250 --> 05:36.625
'There you go.'

05:39.208 --> 05:40.833
How does it feel?

05:40.917 --> 05:43.167
The burning has stopped.

05:46.167 --> 05:48.250
Can you see me?

05:48.333 --> 05:49.583
Yes.

05:50.833 --> 05:53.667
Not as well as before,
but, yes, I can see you.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.167
Mm. It'll take
some getting used to.

06:02.250 --> 06:03.833
- Uh, G'Kar.
- Huh?

06:03.917 --> 06:06.208
Because the eye was made
for humans, not Narns

06:06.292 --> 06:08.458
I had to make some temporary
adjustments for it to work.

06:08.542 --> 06:11.500
- It is not my proper color.
- 'Oh, I can take care of that.'

06:11.583 --> 06:12.917
We'll continue to adjust it
over the next

06:13.000 --> 06:14.417
couple of weeks
as you get used to it.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.875
Now the important thing is..

06:16.000 --> 06:17.042
...that it works.

06:17.125 --> 06:19.000
Oh, yes.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.458
It uses a lot of energy

06:20.542 --> 06:22.958
so you'll have to take it out
at night and recharge it.

06:23.042 --> 06:25.167
- This can be removed?
- Yes, yes.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.792
The area behind it's completely
sealed, so it is safe.

06:27.875 --> 06:31.000
Just wash the eye carefully
before you put it back in.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.875
And you will have to turn it off
when you take it out

06:32.958 --> 06:35.292
otherwise it will continue to
send images to the neural net

06:35.375 --> 06:38.000
at the back of your eye
and that could be disorienting.

06:38.083 --> 06:41.875
It-it-it can work,
outside of me?

06:41.958 --> 06:43.333
Yes.

06:43.417 --> 06:44.375
Interesting.

06:44.458 --> 06:45.375
[computer beeps]

06:45.458 --> 06:47.625
Excuse me. Franklin, go.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.542
(Sheridan)
'Doc, can you swing by
my office in about an hour?'

06:50.625 --> 06:52.125
'I need to talk to you
about a few things.'

06:52.208 --> 06:53.458
'And bring Marcus with you.'

06:53.542 --> 06:54.792
Will do.

06:54.875 --> 06:59.000
Yes, very interesting indeed.

06:59.083 --> 07:00.917
[laughs]

07:11.292 --> 07:15.458
- What the--
- Don't...even, ask.

07:21.250 --> 07:22.708
[chuckles]

07:24.458 --> 07:25.542
(Delenn)
'Yes?'

07:25.625 --> 07:28.042
It's me. Uh, I heard you
wanted to see me.

07:31.583 --> 07:34.083
I was just on my way to..

07:34.167 --> 07:35.250
Delenn?

07:40.458 --> 07:43.042
Where did you say
you were going?

07:43.125 --> 07:45.583
I was, uh..

07:45.667 --> 07:48.042
I was just going to..

07:48.125 --> 07:49.625
[chuckles]

07:49.708 --> 07:52.500
Nowhere that can't wait
for a little while.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.583
Is there some occasion
I should know about?

07:56.667 --> 07:59.250
No, I just thought
when I finish getting ready

07:59.333 --> 08:00.750
you could join me for dinner.

08:00.833 --> 08:03.958
We haven't gone out for dinner
in a very long time.

08:04.042 --> 08:05.625
It, um..

08:05.708 --> 08:07.250
...also occurred to me..

08:07.333 --> 08:10.083
As I told you,
it is tradition for Minbari

08:10.167 --> 08:12.417
to spend three nights together.
The female--

08:12.500 --> 08:14.708
Watches, and the male sleeps

08:14.792 --> 08:18.000
until his true face
is revealed, I know.

08:18.083 --> 08:20.458
Uh, whatever you see
in a face mashed against

08:20.542 --> 08:23.208
a pillow and drooling,
I don't know, but, uh

08:23.292 --> 08:26.750
I try not to be judgmental
about alien cultures

08:26.833 --> 08:29.333
when they are dressed like that.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.917
But what does this
have to do with, um..

08:35.000 --> 08:36.417
Our first night together

08:36.500 --> 08:38.208
was on the White Star.

08:38.292 --> 08:39.542
Our second, in your quarters

08:39.625 --> 08:41.583
before you left for Z'ha'dum.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.208
If we are going to be complete

08:43.292 --> 08:45.042
you owe me a third night.

08:46.417 --> 08:47.417
Tonight?

08:47.500 --> 08:51.083
Um, that's-that's
gonna be a bad time.

08:51.167 --> 08:52.375
I've got late meetings.

08:52.458 --> 08:53.792
I can wait.

08:56.375 --> 08:59.125
Something is up, isn't it?

08:59.208 --> 09:00.250
Wha..

09:02.625 --> 09:05.417
I'm going back to Minbar
tomorrow.

09:06.917 --> 09:09.042
I may be there for some time.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.917
Anything serious?
If I can help, I--

09:14.000 --> 09:17.792
No, no, just some old business
I must attend to, but, uh..

09:17.875 --> 09:20.708
It may, uh, take me away
from here for some time.

09:22.667 --> 09:25.917
It matters to me a great deal
that we finish this, John.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.083
Alright.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.625
I'll, uh..

09:35.708 --> 09:39.083
I'll be here at,
uh, 7:00 for dinner.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.542
I'll, uh, I'll see you then.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.583
[instrumental music]

10:05.667 --> 10:07.667
For the past couple of weeks
President Clark's been

10:07.750 --> 10:10.917
beating the crap out of us
with his propaganda war.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.500
The problem
with the big lie is that

10:12.583 --> 10:14.917
if you repeat it long enough
people start to believe it

10:15.000 --> 10:17.417
and we can't let that happen.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.750
So, we're gonna have
to start going

10:18.833 --> 10:20.333
against him sooner
than we thought.

10:20.417 --> 10:21.500
You know that's what they want.

10:21.583 --> 10:22.542
They're trying to provoke us

10:22.625 --> 10:23.833
into moving before we're ready.

10:23.917 --> 10:25.000
I know, but if we wait too long

10:25.083 --> 10:26.708
we won't be able
to move at all.

10:26.792 --> 10:30.083
They'll have wiped out whatever
credibility we have left.

10:30.167 --> 10:31.500
And this quarantine
is making things

10:31.583 --> 10:33.667
even more difficult for us.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.542
I mean, with all direct traffic
to earth cut off

10:35.625 --> 10:37.208
every signal being intercepted.

10:37.292 --> 10:40.042
I mean, we are blind,
deaf, and stranded.

10:40.125 --> 10:42.917
Well, if we can't go through
them, let's go around them.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.333
Establish some alternate lines
of communication and transit.

10:46.417 --> 10:47.708
Exactly.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.542
And that's where
you two come in.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.875
I need you to meet with our
allies in the Mars colony.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.375
Start coordinating things

10:56.458 --> 10:57.792
make sure they are ready to help

10:57.875 --> 11:01.000
and then let them know
where we stand.

11:01.083 --> 11:02.792
Now, I'd prefer
to do this myself

11:02.875 --> 11:04.875
but they've got my face
on every wanted poster

11:04.958 --> 11:07.333
from here to Proxima Centauri.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.042
Well, why us?

11:09.125 --> 11:10.583
Because the resistance
will need to know

11:10.667 --> 11:12.417
they're dealing
with someone credible.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.125
And you can represent
the command staff

11:14.208 --> 11:15.833
without drawing
too much attention.

11:15.917 --> 11:18.208
Now, Marcus here will go
along as a bodyguard.

11:18.292 --> 11:20.083
It's gonna be a very long trip.

11:20.167 --> 11:21.708
With all direct
shipping routes cut off

11:21.792 --> 11:23.417
we'll have to take
the long way around.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.208
Change ships every other day

11:25.292 --> 11:28.083
to prevent anyone
from becoming suspicious.

11:28.167 --> 11:32.417
I figure it's gonna take two,
two an a half weeks each way.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.833
Better get going.

11:33.917 --> 11:35.750
I've uploaded the information
on your contacts

11:35.833 --> 11:37.750
in the resistance
in your personal files.

11:37.833 --> 11:41.250
Now don't tell anyone
where you're going.

11:41.333 --> 11:44.208
I trust our people,
but let's not push our luck.

11:45.583 --> 11:46.917
Any questions?

11:47.667 --> 11:48.792
Good.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.000
I'll see you when you get back.

11:50.083 --> 11:51.542
Alright.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.458
- Captain.
- Hm.

11:53.542 --> 11:56.292
I saw that report on ISN
about your father being missing.

11:56.375 --> 11:58.375
Now, I know Mars
is a long way away

11:58.458 --> 11:59.833
but, uh, since we're there

11:59.917 --> 12:01.583
I-I thought I could,
ask some questions.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.500
No.

12:03.583 --> 12:05.500
Our resources are spread
thin enough as it is.

12:05.583 --> 12:07.917
I won't use them
for personal inquiries.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.958
That's why they broadcast
that information.

12:12.042 --> 12:13.708
They've probably got
Nightwatch all over town.

12:13.792 --> 12:17.042
If our people show up, they'll
be arrested, interrogated..

12:19.125 --> 12:21.542
[sighs]
No.

12:21.625 --> 12:25.250
Sheridans are survivors,
always have been.

12:25.333 --> 12:26.917
If they had my dad,
they'd have said so

12:27.000 --> 12:29.333
found some way
to use him against me.

12:29.417 --> 12:31.417
But they didn't.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.583
So it means he's still free.

12:36.167 --> 12:39.125
But we can't afford to waste
any more time, Steven

12:39.208 --> 12:42.125
for his sake and ours.

12:42.208 --> 12:43.833
Good luck.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.083
[instrumental music]

13:49.958 --> 13:53.167
I wondered if you were going to
leave without telling me.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.708
My place..

13:57.792 --> 14:00.167
...is at your side, Delenn.

14:00.250 --> 14:03.167
- Not tonight.
- Always.

14:03.250 --> 14:06.375
If you go, you will
learn things about me

14:06.458 --> 14:08.750
that may change
your opinion of me.

14:08.833 --> 14:11.750
Delenn, I have pledged
myself to your side

14:11.833 --> 14:15.708
come fire or storm
or darkness or death.

14:15.792 --> 14:18.750
Can understanding
be a greater danger?

14:18.833 --> 14:20.375
In this case..

14:20.458 --> 14:21.917
...yes.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.667
They're waiting for us.

14:44.833 --> 14:46.958
[instrumental music]

15:13.792 --> 15:15.750
[bells chiming]

15:15.833 --> 15:18.417
Delenn, you understand
why you have been

15:18.500 --> 15:21.333
brought here
to stand before your clan?

15:21.417 --> 15:22.625
I do.

15:22.708 --> 15:25.875
In the long history
of our world no Minbari

15:25.958 --> 15:28.625
has ever taken an off-worlder
as lover or mate.

15:28.708 --> 15:30.208
It has been forbidden

15:30.292 --> 15:33.875
since our people first made
contact with other species.

15:33.958 --> 15:36.167
Without consultation or approval

15:36.250 --> 15:38.333
from the other members
of your own clan

15:38.417 --> 15:41.792
'you made yourself genetically
compatible with the humans'

15:41.875 --> 15:46.417
and have now embraced one of
them as a prospective mate.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.667
This has caused us
concern.

15:49.750 --> 15:52.083
I must follow the calling
of my heart.

15:52.167 --> 15:55.375
What affects only you
is your decision

15:55.458 --> 15:57.542
but not if it affects
the history

15:57.625 --> 16:00.917
and laws and rules
of our society.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
We must determine if it is
the calling of your heart

16:05.083 --> 16:07.250
or something else.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.792
What else could there be?

16:09.875 --> 16:12.708
That is what we must discover.

16:12.792 --> 16:16.125
We have gathered the leaders
of your clan to hear your case.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.208
You will tell us why
you should be allowed

16:18.292 --> 16:21.000
to continue on the path
you have chosen.

16:21.083 --> 16:24.542
If we decide to end
your relationship with the human

16:24.625 --> 16:28.125
you must give us your word that
you will honor our decision.

16:31.792 --> 16:33.333
I will abide

16:33.417 --> 16:35.292
by the decision of my clan.

16:35.375 --> 16:38.250
We are not trying
to be cruel, Delenn.

16:39.667 --> 16:43.792
We want to help you
understand yourself.

16:43.875 --> 16:45.542
Why you have done this

16:45.625 --> 16:49.042
and if it is truly
the right thing for you

16:49.125 --> 16:51.583
and for our world.

16:51.667 --> 16:54.125
If I say I love him..

16:54.208 --> 16:55.500
...is that not enough?

16:55.583 --> 16:59.708
No, you must convince us
on other grounds.

16:59.792 --> 17:02.458
But what other grounds
could there be?

17:02.542 --> 17:03.917
If you set the rules

17:04.000 --> 17:06.708
and you have already
decided that this is wrong

17:06.792 --> 17:08.750
what hope do I have
of convincing you?

17:08.833 --> 17:11.250
That is what you must discover.

17:11.333 --> 17:14.167
You may find you have reasons
for what you are doing

17:14.250 --> 17:16.375
that you do not even realize.

17:16.458 --> 17:20.792
You may even find that
they are the wrong reasons.

17:20.875 --> 17:22.750
It will be difficult

17:22.833 --> 17:25.500
but what you have
asked us to accept

17:25.583 --> 17:28.125
is equally difficult.

17:28.208 --> 17:31.458
It will begin by purifying
your thoughts.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.667
You will enter the dreaming.

17:35.750 --> 17:39.167
We will speak again
when you emerge.

17:39.250 --> 17:42.542
Is there a second who will stay
with her through the dreaming

17:42.625 --> 17:44.792
protect her and guide her?

17:44.875 --> 17:46.167
I will.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.667
Then we will prepare
the whisper gallery.

17:50.292 --> 17:52.542
[bells chiming]

17:54.042 --> 17:56.583
[instrumental music]

18:38.625 --> 18:40.667
[door clatters]

18:50.625 --> 18:52.250
D-Delenn..

18:53.458 --> 18:55.083
You have..

18:55.167 --> 18:57.292
...entered the dreaming before?

18:58.958 --> 19:01.000
Only once..

19:01.083 --> 19:03.458
Before I joined
the Grey council.

19:04.417 --> 19:06.625
I was protector..

19:06.708 --> 19:09.125
...and guide for another.

19:10.708 --> 19:11.958
Who?

19:13.125 --> 19:15.333
Dukhat.

19:15.417 --> 19:18.542
He, who was the greatest of us.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.125
I was an Acolyte.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.292
I was inexperienced.

19:29.708 --> 19:31.375
I was terrified.

19:33.458 --> 19:36.000
[instrumental music]

19:53.042 --> 19:54.792
I am alive.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.833
I'm sorry, master, I..

19:58.917 --> 20:01.167
...I didn't mean to intrude.

20:01.250 --> 20:03.542
You were not breathing, and..

20:03.625 --> 20:05.500
Of course I was.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.958
Sit beside me.

20:13.042 --> 20:15.792
What was your name, child?

20:15.875 --> 20:17.000
Delenn.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.542
Delenn.

20:18.625 --> 20:20.208
Yes.

20:20.292 --> 20:22.625
Of the family of Mir?

20:22.708 --> 20:24.125
Yes, master.

20:24.208 --> 20:26.583
You have a proud heritage,
Delenn of Mir

20:26.667 --> 20:28.375
prouder than you know.

20:30.458 --> 20:32.250
There is nothing to fear
in the dreaming

20:32.333 --> 20:35.292
only that which
we bring with us.

20:35.375 --> 20:37.208
The dreaming takes us forward

20:37.292 --> 20:39.833
and the dreaming takes us back.

20:43.292 --> 20:46.042
Walk with me
in the dreaming, Delenn.

20:48.042 --> 20:50.583
[music continues]

21:00.083 --> 21:01.125
[zapping]

21:01.208 --> 21:02.292

21:12.000 --> 21:14.042
[screaming]

21:18.375 --> 21:19.625
Delenn?

21:20.708 --> 21:23.083
Delenn, I'm here, Delenn.

21:23.167 --> 21:24.833
I won't leave you.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.333
No matter what?

21:26.417 --> 21:28.333
(Lennier)
No matter what.

21:30.292 --> 21:32.875
[instrumental music]

21:46.875 --> 21:48.000
Delenn.

21:48.083 --> 21:50.167
- Master?
- Come with me.

21:55.833 --> 21:58.417
[instrumental music]

22:18.000 --> 22:19.917
Have you ever before
stood in the presence

22:20.000 --> 22:22.083
of the Grey Council, Delenn?

22:22.167 --> 22:23.583
No, master.

22:23.667 --> 22:27.208
And do you consider yourself
their equal in wisdom

22:27.292 --> 22:29.833
judgment, maturity,
and intelligence?

22:29.917 --> 22:32.167
No. No, of course not.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.958
Master, if I said
or did anything--

22:34.042 --> 22:37.042
You will speak
when you are addressed.

22:39.583 --> 22:41.708
For two days
we have been debating

22:41.792 --> 22:44.250
an issue of
some small importance.

22:44.333 --> 22:45.625
We have from time to time

22:45.708 --> 22:48.833
heard of a race,
known as humans.

22:48.917 --> 22:52.167
The Centauri have had dealings
with them for some time.

22:52.250 --> 22:55.042
They're reportedly
primitive, passionate..

22:55.125 --> 22:56.208
...dangerous.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.333
The question..

22:58.417 --> 23:01.125
...do we establish contact
with these humans?

23:01.208 --> 23:03.417
They have each said no

23:03.500 --> 23:05.542
all for different reasons.

23:05.625 --> 23:07.667
Would you like to hear them?

23:07.750 --> 23:10.042
Perhaps another might
be better suited to.

23:10.125 --> 23:13.417
The correct answer is yes.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.500
Yes.

23:15.583 --> 23:18.208
The worker caste fears
their position will be weakened

23:18.292 --> 23:21.167
by more sources of food
and alien artifacts.

23:21.250 --> 23:23.083
The religious caste
is worried about

23:23.167 --> 23:26.458
the impact of strange,
primitive ideas.

23:26.542 --> 23:29.417
And the warrior caste says
we should have nothing to do

23:29.500 --> 23:31.250
with violent, inferior cultures

23:31.333 --> 23:33.750
they are a waste of our time
and resources.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.458
What do you say?

23:38.208 --> 23:41.250
I'm, I'm not qualified to judge.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.000
You are an Acolyte
ten years out of temple

23:43.083 --> 23:44.375
with a head full of notions.

23:44.458 --> 23:47.750
You have been trained
to think and believe.

23:47.833 --> 23:49.958
Now put them to work.

23:50.042 --> 23:53.083
Step into the circle
and answer my question.

24:10.417 --> 24:12.625
Valen said

24:12.708 --> 24:16.708
"The greatest enemy
is the one you do not know.

24:16.792 --> 24:18.500
"You can predict
the actions of those

24:18.583 --> 24:20.542
"who are familiar to you.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.542
"The one you cannot predict

24:22.625 --> 24:25.125
is the one who can harm you."

24:25.208 --> 24:27.708
And what do you say?

24:31.375 --> 24:34.458
If we do not know these humans

24:34.542 --> 24:36.917
then they're a mystery to us.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.750
If the universe puts a mystery
in front of us as a gift

24:40.833 --> 24:44.542
politeness requires that we
at least try to solve it.

24:44.625 --> 24:45.958
Aha!

24:46.042 --> 24:47.542
You're curious.

24:48.458 --> 24:49.875
You'd like to know

24:49.958 --> 24:51.500
to simply understand.

24:53.083 --> 24:55.542
Simple curiosity.

24:55.625 --> 24:58.875
Ministers and counselors
and warriors..

24:58.958 --> 25:01.208
...and not one of you
has the sense of curiosity

25:01.292 --> 25:03.333
of a simple Acolyte.

25:03.417 --> 25:06.583
Are you so jaded, so superior,
so smug in your complacency

25:06.667 --> 25:09.083
that you have lost
the simplest of joys

25:09.167 --> 25:11.958
that of the child
and the closed box?

25:17.833 --> 25:20.250
Leave me.

25:20.333 --> 25:21.625
Continue your meditations.

25:21.708 --> 25:23.667
We'll discuss this again
tomorrow.

25:25.875 --> 25:28.458
[instrumental music]

25:30.875 --> 25:32.583
You look as if
you've been terrified

25:32.667 --> 25:34.875
into another
and better incarnation.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.625
Come.

25:37.708 --> 25:39.167
Walk with me.

25:46.625 --> 25:48.000
Master..

25:48.083 --> 25:50.500
...may I ask a question?

25:50.583 --> 25:52.958
- Will you make contact?
- No.

25:53.042 --> 25:55.375
The council will be
even more determined now.

25:55.458 --> 25:57.958
I could override their decision,
but nothing would be served.

25:58.042 --> 26:01.417
Authority should never
be used as a club, Delenn.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.083
But then why?

26:03.167 --> 26:04.625
When others do a foolish thing

26:04.708 --> 26:07.000
you should tell them
it is a foolish thing.

26:07.083 --> 26:08.417
They can still continue to do it

26:08.500 --> 26:11.667
but at least the truth
is where it needs to be.

26:12.708 --> 26:15.167
They will be most upset
with you now.

26:15.250 --> 26:17.125
You have embarrassed them.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.208
I apologize for that.

26:19.292 --> 26:21.542
In my anger, I believe
I may have caused you

26:21.625 --> 26:23.250
more problems in the future.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.083
No, no, master.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.417
It was an honor.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.458
Don't interrupt
when I'm being kind.

26:29.542 --> 26:31.667
It does not happen often,
Delenn.

26:33.750 --> 26:35.667
Raise your eyes and look at me.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.333
It is disrespectful.

26:37.417 --> 26:41.083
I cannot have an aide
who will not look up.

26:41.167 --> 26:45.042
'You will be forever
walking into things.'

26:45.125 --> 26:46.667
Your aide?

26:46.750 --> 26:49.125
Your spirit is strong.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.500
And since I have now
alienated everyone else

26:51.583 --> 26:53.500
who would be your mentor?

26:53.583 --> 26:56.250
I will teach you myself.

26:56.333 --> 26:58.417
We'll begin your
training tomorrow

26:58.500 --> 27:02.167
after the council has once again
explained its wisdom to me.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.292
(Dukhat)
'Where this will all end,
I don't know.'

27:09.375 --> 27:10.792
'But there are still many years'

27:10.875 --> 27:13.458
'ahead of us in which
to find out.'

27:15.458 --> 27:16.833
'I suspect the journey'

27:16.917 --> 27:20.083
'will be a curious
and fascinating one.'

27:21.792 --> 27:23.458
'It always is.'

27:37.292 --> 27:39.458
(Delenn)
'I am become Grey.'

27:41.083 --> 27:43.208
I stand between the darkness..

27:44.750 --> 27:46.583
...and the light.

27:54.875 --> 27:56.583
Between the candle..

27:58.208 --> 27:59.875
...and the star.

28:10.292 --> 28:12.667
I was passing by
on my way to sleep.

28:14.042 --> 28:15.625
But I wanted to congratulate
you again

28:15.708 --> 28:19.167
on being accepted
into the Grey Council.

28:19.250 --> 28:21.333
I am very proud of you, Delenn.

28:21.417 --> 28:23.125
You've come so far.

28:23.208 --> 28:24.667
Thanks to you.

28:25.625 --> 28:27.042
Everything I am

28:27.125 --> 28:28.917
everything I shall ever be

28:29.000 --> 28:31.042
I owe to you.

28:31.125 --> 28:32.792
I'm not so sure.

28:32.875 --> 28:35.542
You seem troubled. Why?

28:36.583 --> 28:38.125
When I touched the Triluminary

28:38.208 --> 28:39.750
it glowed briefly.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.208
From your reaction

28:41.292 --> 28:43.292
may I assume that it
hasn't done that before?

28:44.875 --> 28:48.042
It confirmed something I've have
suspected for some time.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.667
The Triluminaries
were a gift from Valen.

28:51.750 --> 28:53.167
They came to us from long ago

28:53.250 --> 28:56.000
a thousand years in our past.

28:56.083 --> 28:59.042
There is a story
that they also came to us

28:59.125 --> 29:01.167
from a time far in our future.

29:01.250 --> 29:03.583
Until today, I wasn't sure.

29:05.125 --> 29:07.167
Now that you are
with the Grey Council

29:07.250 --> 29:09.667
you should know I did not
choose you by accident.

29:09.750 --> 29:12.000
There was a purpose
in my selection.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.000
Your heritage..

29:14.083 --> 29:15.708
That's strange.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.125
Come.

29:18.208 --> 29:20.083
[bells chiming]

29:22.500 --> 29:23.500
What is it?

29:23.583 --> 29:25.167
We detected these alien ships

29:25.250 --> 29:26.708
approaching our space.

29:26.792 --> 29:28.667
I've never seen those markings
before, who are they?

29:28.750 --> 29:32.625
- 'Unknown, master.'
- I believe they are the humans.

29:32.708 --> 29:34.792
I have investigated them
on my own.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.042
They have tried to contact us

29:36.125 --> 29:38.167
but we do not understand
their language.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.625
As is our custom, we are
approaching with gun ports open.

29:40.708 --> 29:42.125
By whose order?

29:42.208 --> 29:44.667
Master, that is the tradition
of the warrior caste.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.500
A gesture of strength
and respect.

29:46.583 --> 29:48.208
They can see our weapons,
they can see

29:48.292 --> 29:49.667
we approach them open-handed.

29:49.750 --> 29:52.292
Master, there.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.167
Soul Hunters.

29:54.250 --> 29:57.250
Soul Hunters come,
only where there's great death.

29:57.333 --> 30:00.208
- Close the gun ports.
- If we do not provoke them..

30:00.292 --> 30:02.333
[zapping]

30:03.125 --> 30:04.167
[explosion]

30:12.292 --> 30:13.542
[explosion]

30:13.625 --> 30:15.458
Somebody, help me!

30:15.542 --> 30:17.000
Help me!

30:18.958 --> 30:20.833
[indistinct chatter]

30:24.125 --> 30:26.167
[sobbing]

30:37.208 --> 30:38.917
Delenn, we need to strike back

30:39.000 --> 30:40.667
but the council is divided.

30:40.750 --> 30:43.250
Do we follow them back
to their base and take revenge

30:43.333 --> 30:46.417
or do we wait, try to find out
what happened?

30:46.500 --> 30:49.042
'Yours is the deciding vote,
Delenn.'

30:49.125 --> 30:51.583
He was the best of us.

30:51.667 --> 30:53.500
They struck without provocation.

30:53.583 --> 30:55.667
There was no reason.

30:55.750 --> 30:57.750
Animals!

30:57.833 --> 30:59.917
Brutal!

31:00.000 --> 31:01.958
They deserve no mercy.

31:02.042 --> 31:03.292
Strike them down!

31:03.375 --> 31:05.042
Follow them to their base and

31:05.125 --> 31:07.750
and kill them, all of them!

31:07.833 --> 31:10.167
All of them!

31:10.250 --> 31:12.083
No mercy!

31:13.708 --> 31:16.042
No mercy!

31:16.125 --> 31:20.250
No mercy!
No mercy!

31:23.333 --> 31:24.750
Then it was your order

31:24.833 --> 31:27.292
that began our war
with the humans.

31:27.375 --> 31:29.042
Yes.

31:29.125 --> 31:30.958
The council was divided.

31:31.042 --> 31:33.958
Mine was the deciding vote.

31:34.042 --> 31:35.750
They killed Dukhat.

31:35.833 --> 31:37.292
I was furious.

31:37.375 --> 31:40.292
I never knew myself
capable of such rage.

31:40.375 --> 31:42.167
All I could see was death.

31:43.583 --> 31:45.792
Is this what you were afraid
I would see?

31:47.333 --> 31:49.667
Then you were not thinking
clearly, Delenn.

31:49.750 --> 31:51.500
The fault is not yours.

31:51.583 --> 31:54.458
The humans misinterpreted
the gesture of respect.

31:54.542 --> 31:57.208
They thought it to be
a prelude to an attack.

31:57.292 --> 31:58.500
You were..

31:58.583 --> 32:01.042
The one who gave the order.

32:01.125 --> 32:03.417
Nothing can change that,
Lennier.

32:15.458 --> 32:17.208
Our brothers?

32:18.458 --> 32:19.833
Dead.

32:21.250 --> 32:24.375
They have been avenged,
at least in part.

32:24.458 --> 32:26.833
The greater debt
will be paid soon.

32:26.917 --> 32:29.417
Word of the attack has spread
throughout Minbar.

32:29.500 --> 32:32.875
Our people have gone mad
with grief and rage.

32:32.958 --> 32:35.375
We told them no mercy..

32:35.458 --> 32:38.083
...as they showed us no mercy.

32:38.167 --> 32:39.708
No mercy..

32:39.792 --> 32:41.792
...but perhaps wisdom.

32:41.875 --> 32:44.333
Are you changing
your vote, Delenn?

32:44.417 --> 32:47.083
I was enraged, grief stricken.

32:47.167 --> 32:49.458
I didn't consider my words.

32:49.542 --> 32:52.292
Both sides have now
endured great loss.

32:52.375 --> 32:55.417
Perhaps there is time
to avoid even greater loss.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.833
We can at least try
to speak to them.

32:57.917 --> 33:00.542
- Find another way.
- It's too late.

33:00.625 --> 33:02.958
It's a holy war now, Delenn.

33:03.042 --> 33:05.625
It has taken on a life
of it's own.

33:05.708 --> 33:07.583
We are a world gone mad

33:07.667 --> 33:10.708
and it is only our rage that
gives us purpose any longer.

33:10.792 --> 33:12.667
That rage cannot be stopped

33:12.750 --> 33:15.125
it can only exhaust
itself in blood!

33:21.958 --> 33:24.417
He was right.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.083
We should have made contact
with the humans.

33:35.167 --> 33:36.917
A moment of rage.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.375
I have spent the last
ten years of my life

33:40.458 --> 33:43.000
trying to make up for it.

33:43.083 --> 33:44.875
And that is why you have agreed

33:44.958 --> 33:47.458
to become one with Sheridan.

33:47.542 --> 33:49.917
You're still grieving
for your actions

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
still guilty over the death
of so many humans

33:53.083 --> 33:54.917
trying to atone
for your mistake.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.833
You cannot believe that.

33:56.917 --> 33:58.333
Not after we've been
through so much.

33:58.417 --> 34:01.625
- You've seen.
- Yes, I have.

34:01.708 --> 34:03.583
And, no, I do not believe it

34:03.667 --> 34:05.958
but we cannot lie
about the dreaming.

34:06.042 --> 34:08.625
And when we tell them
what the dreaming has shown us

34:08.708 --> 34:10.208
this is what they will say

34:10.292 --> 34:13.250
and that is what
they will believe.

34:13.333 --> 34:17.625
But why would the dreaming
show me this of all things?

34:17.708 --> 34:19.375
Why this?

34:22.208 --> 34:24.250
The dreaming is finished.

34:24.333 --> 34:26.125
You must rest now.

34:26.208 --> 34:27.625
In the morning you will tell us

34:27.708 --> 34:29.042
what you have seen.

34:29.125 --> 34:31.917
Then we will
render our decision.

34:38.375 --> 34:40.917
[instrumental music]

34:46.542 --> 34:49.292
I cannot have an aide
who will not look up.

34:51.625 --> 34:54.000
(Dukhat)
You have a proud heritage,
Delenn of Mir.

34:54.083 --> 34:55.792
Prouder than you know.

34:57.542 --> 35:00.708
You should know I did not choose
you by accident.

35:03.458 --> 35:05.417
Somebody, help me!

35:05.500 --> 35:07.167
Help me!

35:15.667 --> 35:17.750
Somebody, help me!

35:17.833 --> 35:19.417
Help me!

35:19.500 --> 35:23.167
There was a purpose
in my selection.

35:23.250 --> 35:25.000
Your heritage.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.042
[intense music]

35:30.833 --> 35:32.750
Delenn?

35:32.833 --> 35:34.375
Delenn?

35:43.125 --> 35:46.542
Delenn, what are you doing?

35:46.625 --> 35:48.667
- Going back.
- This cannot be allowed!

35:48.750 --> 35:50.208
The dreaming is over.

35:50.292 --> 35:51.708
We must now wait until morning.

35:51.792 --> 35:54.250
No, we are going back,
and you are going with us.

35:54.333 --> 35:57.042
Do you want to see?
Do you want to know the truth?

35:57.125 --> 36:00.083
Then come and see,
touch and feel what I have seen.

36:00.167 --> 36:02.083
Then you'll understand.

36:05.292 --> 36:07.833
[dramatic music]

36:13.333 --> 36:15.208
This is not as things
are done, Delenn.

36:15.292 --> 36:17.000
You know this.

36:21.292 --> 36:23.083
Take it.

36:23.167 --> 36:25.667
There's nothing to fear
in the dreaming.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.458
Only that which
we bring with us.

36:28.542 --> 36:31.542
Walk with me in the dreaming,
Callenn.

36:38.167 --> 36:40.208
[zapping]

36:42.125 --> 36:44.083
Somebody, help me!

36:44.167 --> 36:46.750
Help me!

36:46.833 --> 36:49.250
[indistinct chattering]

36:49.333 --> 36:51.583
(Delenn)
I could not hear him then.

36:51.667 --> 36:54.083
This is what the dreaming
wanted me to see.

36:55.125 --> 36:58.833
Listen.
Listen.

36:58.917 --> 37:01.917
There was a purpose
in my selection.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.833
Your heritage.

37:04.917 --> 37:06.042
Listen.

37:06.708 --> 37:08.417
You are..

37:09.500 --> 37:11.792
...a child of Valen.

37:11.875 --> 37:13.417
[gasps]

37:15.625 --> 37:17.042
Did you hear?

37:17.125 --> 37:18.917
I heard.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.417
A child of Valen.

37:30.375 --> 37:31.667
Did you get the records?

37:31.750 --> 37:33.667
The guards resisted at first.

37:33.750 --> 37:35.042
The Grey Council has disbanded

37:35.125 --> 37:36.833
but their security remains.

37:36.917 --> 37:40.667
I managed to explain
matters to them.

37:40.750 --> 37:43.833
They will recover in time.

37:43.917 --> 37:45.417
Many of our records were lost

37:45.500 --> 37:47.417
during the last great war
a thousand years ago

37:47.500 --> 37:49.792
but some were kept
in the archives

37:49.875 --> 37:51.792
of the Grey Council.

37:51.875 --> 37:54.292
This proves what I suspected.

37:54.375 --> 37:56.250
Do you wish to see?

37:56.333 --> 37:58.625
Delenn, I-I'm not sure
I understand.

37:58.708 --> 38:01.167
Valen, who created
the Grey Council

38:01.250 --> 38:02.875
defeated the Shadows.

38:02.958 --> 38:04.792
A Minbari not born of Minbari

38:04.875 --> 38:08.500
we know was Jeffrey Sinclair,
a human who became Minbari

38:08.583 --> 38:10.458
genetically altered
by the Triluminary

38:10.542 --> 38:12.625
he received from Epsilon III.

38:12.708 --> 38:15.125
Little is known of his
activities after the war.

38:15.208 --> 38:17.333
Even his death
remains a mystery.

38:17.417 --> 38:18.750
His body never found.

38:18.833 --> 38:20.375
But Dukhat knew.

38:20.458 --> 38:22.625
Dukhat had seen these records.

38:22.708 --> 38:24.875
We knew that after his change

38:24.958 --> 38:27.958
human and Minbari souls
began to merge.

38:28.042 --> 38:30.708
But that was not all
that merged.

38:32.125 --> 38:34.375
Valen was still partly human

38:34.458 --> 38:36.375
as I am partly Minbari.

38:36.458 --> 38:39.500
After the war, Valen married
and had children.

38:39.583 --> 38:42.833
They left Minbar to escape
those who would persecute them.

38:42.917 --> 38:46.208
After Valen died, his children
returned to Minbar.

38:46.292 --> 38:48.542
They married
and had more children.

38:48.625 --> 38:52.625
Human DNA entered into our race.

38:52.708 --> 38:53.917
And over a thousand years

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
how many of our people
carry his legacy?

38:58.667 --> 39:01.083
They cannot be counted.

39:01.167 --> 39:03.458
You knew, didn't you?

39:04.917 --> 39:07.417
You would destroy
the purity of our race!

39:07.500 --> 39:09.292
I could not let it happen again!

39:09.375 --> 39:11.333
But our race is not pure!

39:11.417 --> 39:13.083
Many of our people
carry human DNA

39:13.167 --> 39:14.542
in our blood and in our cells.

39:14.625 --> 39:15.917
I'm one of them.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.208
That's why the Triluminary
glowed when I touched it.

39:18.292 --> 39:20.917
It was programmed
for Sinclair's DNA

39:21.000 --> 39:22.958
and a trace of that
is still within me.

39:24.167 --> 39:26.042
That will be my defense.

39:27.375 --> 39:29.750
If I am not pure Minbari

39:29.833 --> 39:31.667
it doesn't matter
if I marry Sheridan.

39:31.750 --> 39:34.833
My children will never be
pure Minbari either way

39:34.917 --> 39:36.375
so there is nothing to lose.

39:36.458 --> 39:37.750
No.

39:37.833 --> 39:40.000
Delenn, I beg of you

39:40.083 --> 39:41.667
if others knew of this

39:41.750 --> 39:43.833
it would cause great confusion.

39:43.917 --> 39:45.375
It must remain secret

39:45.458 --> 39:48.167
for the good of everyone.

39:48.250 --> 39:51.542
You demanded,
I show you a reason.

39:51.625 --> 39:53.292
I have done so.

39:57.333 --> 39:58.583
Wait!

39:59.875 --> 40:02.917
'There is another way.'

40:05.250 --> 40:08.125
It was our tradition, long ago

40:08.208 --> 40:11.875
when we still warred
amongst ourselves..

40:11.958 --> 40:13.750
...after the war was over

40:13.833 --> 40:16.000
each side would give
one of its own

40:16.083 --> 40:18.125
to the other in marriage.

40:18.208 --> 40:21.500
The victorious side
gave a female of its clan

40:21.583 --> 40:22.875
to the one that lost

40:22.958 --> 40:24.833
that suffered the most deaths

40:24.917 --> 40:27.333
'as a symbol of life and hope.'

40:28.583 --> 40:30.458
We..

40:30.542 --> 40:33.875
I...can explain this
to our people

40:33.958 --> 40:35.917
as a similar offering
to the humans

40:36.000 --> 40:38.917
who died during our war.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.250
You are willing
to pledge yourself

40:42.333 --> 40:44.625
as a symbol of life.

40:46.375 --> 40:49.333
It is a great sacrifice

40:49.417 --> 40:51.167
I imagine.

41:02.125 --> 41:05.125
[instrumental music]

41:14.958 --> 41:17.542
- Hey.
- John.

41:17.625 --> 41:19.042
What, what are you doing here?

41:19.125 --> 41:21.708
Well, I just I-I heard that
your ship was docking

41:21.792 --> 41:23.708
and I wanted to make sure
you were on it.

41:23.792 --> 41:25.708
I'll go and see to our things,
Delenn.

41:25.792 --> 41:27.208
Captain.

41:27.292 --> 41:29.208
Well, is everything
alright back home?

41:29.292 --> 41:31.917
Did you take care
of whatever was you where

41:32.000 --> 41:34.292
going to deal with?

41:34.375 --> 41:36.708
Yes.
Everything's fine now.

41:36.792 --> 41:39.042
Uh-huh.

41:39.125 --> 41:41.667
And you're still not going to
tell me what it was, are you?

41:43.458 --> 41:45.750
Anything happen
while I was gone?

41:45.833 --> 41:47.250
Ah, not much.

41:47.333 --> 41:49.583
Franklin and Marcus are still
on route to Mars.

41:49.667 --> 41:50.708
Been about a week.

41:50.792 --> 41:52.417
Have you heard from them
recently?

41:52.500 --> 41:54.708
Not in about three days.

41:54.792 --> 41:56.750
But we figured they'd be
out of touch, though.

41:56.833 --> 42:00.958
Knowing those two guys, probably
stopping off to see the sights

42:01.042 --> 42:03.583
'turn it into a real vacation.'

42:17.833 --> 42:21.458
Is this really the best ship
you could find?

42:21.542 --> 42:22.875
Yes.

42:22.958 --> 42:24.250
Smells like the inside

42:24.333 --> 42:25.625
of a Martian pleasure dome

42:25.708 --> 42:27.833
on Sunday morning.

42:27.917 --> 42:30.000
Wouldn't know about that.

42:30.083 --> 42:31.292
Look, don't make me
come over there

42:31.375 --> 42:32.958
and take that thing from you.

42:33.042 --> 42:35.458
Helps me relax.

42:35.542 --> 42:37.250
Marcus, this is the kind
of conversation

42:37.333 --> 42:39.667
that can only end in a gunshot.

42:41.125 --> 42:42.292
Would you like me
to sing instead?

42:42.375 --> 42:43.417
No.

42:43.500 --> 42:45.708
- You haven't heard me.
- Marcus, please.
