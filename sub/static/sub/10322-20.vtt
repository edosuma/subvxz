Randy, what are you doin'?
Grandpa tied that tie for me
five years ago.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.913
You know I don't know how
to tie it again.

00:12.980 --> 00:15.516
I'm sorry, Earl.
I just wanted to show you
what I'd look like...

00:15.583 --> 00:17.785
as a drunk guy
at an '80s party.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.522
Nice.
Rock the Casbah.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.192
Hurry up!
If I'm late for the funeral,
I'm gonna get in trouble.

The last girl to show up
has to give the departed
his final lap dance.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.565
[ Earl Narrating ]
There was only
one man in town...

00:31.632 --> 00:35.035
who could make
people afraid of him
even from beyond the grave.

00:36.704 --> 00:40.341
And that man was Richard Chubby.
During his lifetime,

00:40.408 --> 00:42.343
Richard Chubby
was a powerful businessman.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.345
He owned everything
worth owning in Camden.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.714
Well, come on down!
And don't forget,

00:46.780 --> 00:50.751
sweatpants are allowed
and truckers shower for free.

00:50.818 --> 00:55.323
- And Richard Chubby liked more
than just the smell of money.
- Woof.

00:55.389 --> 00:59.660
And when you combine all
that money and all that power,
you get a whole lot of crazy.

Open up.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.934

01:07.000 --> 01:09.837
[ Earl Narrating ]
And even if he didn't have
a weapon in his hand,

01:09.903 --> 01:11.905
his hand was still a weapon.

01:11.972 --> 01:15.109
It was the scariest
when even Chubby didn't know
what he was doin'.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.945
Would you like me
to freshen that drink for you?

01:18.011 --> 01:20.614
I'll be damned.
[ Laughs ]

01:20.681 --> 01:22.616
I got the wrong gun.

01:22.683 --> 01:26.320
[ Earl Narrating ]
There was a huge crowd
at Chubby's funeral,

01:26.387 --> 01:28.622
not 'cause people loved him,
but 'cause attendance...

01:28.689 --> 01:30.724
was mandatory for all
Chubby employees.

01:30.791 --> 01:34.061
Even worse,
the service was scheduled during
their unpaid lunch break.

01:34.128 --> 01:37.831
Damn shame.
I heard Chubby was just tryin'
to do vodka shots,

01:37.898 --> 01:40.468
picked up the wrong gun
and blew his head off.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.970
Poor guy.
Could've happened
to anybody.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.906
You know, we could leave.
It's not like Chubby's
gonna pop out of the coffin...

01:45.973 --> 01:47.875
and kill people
if they walk out.

01:47.941 --> 01:52.012
The reason we're staying
is because of the new boss.
They say he's even worse.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.114
[ Horn Honking ]

01:55.916 --> 01:59.119
[ Earl Narrating ]
Catalina was right.
The new boss was even worse,

01:59.187 --> 02:03.757
because with Big Chubby gone,
there was only one person to
take over the family business--

02:03.824 --> 02:06.394
his son, Little Chubby.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.464
My name is Earl.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.703
[ Earl Narrating ]
Now that Big Chubby had died,

02:15.769 --> 02:18.639
his son was the most
powerful man in Camden County.

02:18.706 --> 02:23.043
That made me nervous,
since me and him had history.

02:23.110 --> 02:26.314
A few years ago,
Little Chubby's favorite hobby
was messin' with people.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.316
He messed with Randy.
Hey, Randy.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.318

on your shirt.

I'm not fallin' for that again.

Get your ear pierced,

02:45.032 --> 02:47.000
Then we could be
earring buddies.

But the reason
he ended up on my list...

was he messed with Joy

with Earl Junior.

Did I ever tell you that I, uh,
always had a fantasy of doin' it
with a pregnant chick?

It's like havin' sex
with a fat chick,
except I can't get her pregnant.

to kill Little Chubby... slowly.

to do somethin' crazy,

Truth is, the day you kicked me
was a-- Well, it was
a turning point in my life.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.620
[ Earl Narrating ]
Little Chubby explained that...

05:19.687 --> 05:22.390
what hurt more than the
stabbing pain in his baby-makers
was the realization...

05:22.456 --> 05:24.825
that everyone hated him.

05:26.694 --> 05:30.030
And even weeks later,
he couldn't shake the pain.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.036
And so he just kept walking.

they can do more than just
take a walk around the block.

They can take a walk anywhere.
What's up, Aborigines?

he got the idea to be
a nicer person in the world--

to be better people.

Little Chubby, not Grimace.
I'm sure Grimace
pulls chicks left and right.

The injury could have affected
his libido, like when
you get a dog neutered...

and it doesn't wanna
hump your leg anymore,
even if you're wearing corduroy.

even look when I kissed Lacey
