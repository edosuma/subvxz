05:32.466 --> 05:34.368
I WAS IN THE CAR.
HOW DID I SHOOT HER?

YOU'RE AN ACCOMPLICE.

05:36.404 --> 05:37.905
JUST AS GUILTY.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.140

THAT PRETTY LADY WOULD BE DEAD.

05:40.173 --> 05:44.812
AND THOSE MESSAGES SHE GOT,
THEY WEREN'T THREATS.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.980

THEY WERE HAPPY.

05:51.419 --> 05:54.988
THEY WANTED THE DETECTIVE
TO LEAVE US ALONE.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.391
- SO YOU DID GET THREATS
FROM MS. CHANG'S PEOPLE?

05:57.425 --> 06:00.494

- WHICH YOU DID NOT REPORT.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.730

07:19.206 --> 07:20.808
COULDN'T SHOOT HIMSELF
IN THE FOOT

07:20.841 --> 07:22.543
IF HE HAD A SHOTGUN
TAPED TO HIS ANKLE.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.777

07:33.854 --> 07:36.189
I MEAN, THEY SHOOT ME,
I STOP PAYING.

07:36.223 --> 07:39.226
- THEY DIDN'T KILL YOU.
IT COULD'VE BEEN A WARNING.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.994
- NOW, MRS. CHANG,

07:41.028 --> 07:44.498
IT'S A BIG STEP FROM

07:44.532 --> 07:46.900
YOU KNOW, OKAY,
SO MAYBE THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.669

11:30.758 --> 11:32.192
- SHE'S STILL A TOMBOY.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.161
STRAIGHT OUT OF THE ARMY
INTO THE POLICE ACADEMY.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.229
SHE'LL MAKE FIRST GRADE
BEFORE EITHER ONE OF YOU.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.365
- DAD.
- GOOD FOR YOU.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.133
- THEY THINK SOME SCUMBAG

11:40.167 --> 11:42.169
IS SHOOTING PEOPLE INVOLVED
WITH OUR OLD UNIT.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.872
- YOU SURE?
- DON'T WORRY, SWEETIE.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.273
THEY'RE NOT COMING AFTER
THE GIMPY ONES.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.842
- STOP.
WHAT ABOUT ESCOBAR?

11:48.876 --> 11:50.510
HE DID SHOOT YOU ONCE.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.479
HE HAD ANOTHER PAROLE HEARING
A FEW MONTHS BACK,

11:52.512 --> 11:54.214
RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.283
- DID HE GET OUT?
- NO.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.051
NOT FOR NOTHING,

11:58.085 --> 12:00.954
BUT YOU'D KNOW THAT
IF YOU'D BEEN THERE.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.190
- YOU KNOW,
I REALLY MEANT TO, BUT...

12:03.223 --> 12:04.892
IT WAS CHRISTMAS TIME.

12:04.925 --> 12:07.828
I HAD A LOT OF FAMILY STUFF
GOING ON.

12:08.829 --> 12:12.299
- MAYBE NEXT TIME, FIN.

12:12.332 --> 12:15.969
- ESCOBAR.
HE WAS TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.838
HE COULD STILL HAVE REACH
FROM PRISON.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.107
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE?
- TWO YEARS.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.943
WE WORKED OUR WAY
THROUGH HUNDREDS OF DEALERS,

12:22.976 --> 12:25.445
RUNNERS, KI-AND-OUNCE MEN
TO GET TO HIM.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.147
- HE SHOT LUIS.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.416
YOU SAID THE BULLET
WAS MEANT FOR YOU?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.051
- YEAH.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.053
WE WERE MAKING OUR LAST BUY
FROM ESCOBAR.

12:33.086 --> 12:36.189
SOMEBODY
MUST'VE RATTED ME OUT.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.490
NEXT THING I KNOW,

12:37.524 --> 12:39.993
I GOT A .38
TO THE BACK OF MY HEAD.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.129
LUIS JUMPED IN.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.197
THE GUN WENT OFF.

12:44.231 --> 12:48.268
HE GOT HIT TWICE...
IN THE HIP AND THE KNEE.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.071
I LEFT NARCOTICS THAT DAY.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.806
- THAT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.575
- YEAH, JUST LIKE IT WASN'T
MY FAULT WITH ROLLINS.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.946
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, NICK.
WALK BEHIND ME.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.285
[buzzer]

13:05.318 --> 13:07.855
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.190
IF IT ISN'T MR. LUCKY.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.259
HIS PARTNER
DOESN'T TACKLE ME...

13:12.292 --> 13:15.362
I WOULD'VE BLOWN OFF HIS HEAD
WITH MY .38.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.198
- YOU REALLY THINK BRAGGING
TO COPS ABOUT SHOOTING COPS

13:18.231 --> 13:20.200
IS A GOOD IDEA?

13:20.233 --> 13:22.202
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

13:22.235 --> 13:24.337
SEND ME TO PRISON?

13:24.371 --> 13:28.508
I HEARD YOUR NEW PARTNER GOT
SHOT IN FRONT OF THE PRECINCT.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.243
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT MY PARTNER?

13:30.277 --> 13:32.212
- THE BLONDIE?

13:32.245 --> 13:34.281
WHAT I SAW ON TV.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.949
SHE LOOKED REAL PRETTY...

13:35.983 --> 13:37.117
BLEEDING IN YOUR ARMS.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.119
- IF I FOUND OUT
YOU SHOT HER,

13:39.152 --> 13:40.520
I'LL KILL YOU
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE YARD!

13:40.553 --> 13:44.091
YOU THINK THIS CO's
GONNA STOP ME?

13:44.124 --> 13:46.293
- I BEEN HERE 15 YEARS.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.295
WHO DO YOU THINK
THEY WORK FOR?

13:48.328 --> 13:52.432
- OYE, AMIGO, WE'RE GOING
THROUGH YOUR VISITORS,

13:52.465 --> 13:55.235
YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR FAMILY.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.105
WE'RE GONNA BE UP INSIDE YOU
SO DEEP...

13:58.138 --> 14:00.307
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO WALK STRAIGHT.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.052
- ESCOBAR IS KING RAT
IN HERE.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.423
HE PIMPS OUT THE NEWBIES
FOR SEX.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.025
HE RUNS THE DRUGS,
THE CELL PHONES.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.459
- HIS FRIENDS ON THE OUTSIDE
SUPPLY HIM?

14:19.492 --> 14:22.996
- WE CUT OUT HIS PHONE CALLS,
WE REDUCED HIS VISITORS.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.464
NOTHING SEEMS
TO SLOW HIM DOWN.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.366
- YOU TRY LOCKING HIM
IN THE HOLE?

14:26.399 --> 14:28.135
- HE HIT US
WITH A BUNCH OF LAWSUITS

14:28.168 --> 14:30.337
BECAUSE OF INHUMANE TREATMENT
DUE TO HIS HEALTH ISSUES.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.639
- HEALTH ISSUES?
- YEAH, ASTHMA.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.307
CLINIC NURSE BACKED HIS CLAIM.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.209
BUT IT TURNS OUT
HE TURNED HER TOO.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.611
WE FIRED HER
AFTER HE GOT HER PREGNANT.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.313
- SHE EVER VISIT?

14:40.347 --> 14:43.883
- YEAH, SHE BRINGS
THEIR LITTLE BOY.

14:45.452 --> 14:49.256
- OKAY, SO I BROKE THE RULES.
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.390
I HAVE BENITO, JR.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.492
- LOOKS LIKE
A SWEET LITTLE GUY.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.327
- HIS FATHER'S GREAT
WITH HIM.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.029
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S REALLY LIKE.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.530
- WELL, TWO PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN SHOT, ANA.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.332
PEOPLE THAT ARE CONNECTED

14:59.366 --> 15:02.569
TO THE POLICE OFFICERS WHO PUT
YOUR BOYFRIEND ESCOBAR AWAY.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.337
- SO?

15:04.371 --> 15:06.073
- SO WE NEED TO KNOW
WHETHER OR NOT HE'S INVOLVED.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.408
IF HE'S NOT, WE MOVE ON.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.310
- HOW COULD HE BE INVOLVED?

15:10.343 --> 15:13.280
HE SPENDS 23 HOURS A DAY
IN A TINY CELL.

15:13.313 --> 15:16.349
HE CAN'T ANY PHONE CALLS,
AND THEY CENSOR HIS MAIL.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.484
- WHEN YOU GO VISIT HIM,

15:17.517 --> 15:19.252
DOES HE ASK YOU
TO RELAY MESSAGES?

15:19.286 --> 15:22.189
- WHEN I VISIT HIM,
HE PLAYS WITH BENITO, JR.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.391
WE TALK ABOUT FEEDING HIS SON
ON A PART-TIME JOB

15:24.424 --> 15:25.592
AND FOOD STAMPS.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.094
- AND THAT'S IT?

15:27.127 --> 15:30.230
- KEEP US ALIVE,
AVOIDING BEING HOMELESS.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.699
YEAH, THAT'S KIND OF
A FULL-TIME CONVERSATION.

15:34.634 --> 15:38.471
COME ON, BENITO.
COME ON, BABY.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.375
- THE NURSE ANA LIED.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.377
CHECKED HER PHONE RECORDS.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.014
AFTER VISITS TO ESCOBAR,

15:47.047 --> 15:49.382
SHE CALLED A MEMBER
OF HIS OLD CREW.

15:49.416 --> 15:53.253
CALVIN "PEARLIE" JONES.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.723
- I KNOW THIS DUDE.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.291
HE DID EIGHT YEARS
FOR SELLING BLOW.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.327
HE'S PROBABLY BACK
ON THE STREETS.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.995
- HE LOOKS LIKE A PUNK.
THIS GUY'S A MARKSMAN?

16:02.029 --> 16:04.097
- HE USED TO BE ESCOBAR'S
MIDDLE MAN.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.732
MAYBE HE HIRED OUT.
I GOT HIM.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.234
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE BENSON.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.336
LISTEN, I TALKED TO ROLLINS
THIS MORNING.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.737
SHE'S GONNA BE THERE
FOR A FEW MORE DAYS.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.505
SHE'S PICKED UP AN INFECTION.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.174
- SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY THOUGH.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.442
- WELL, THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT HOSPITALS.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.310
LONGER YOU STAY,
THE SICKER YOU GET.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.146
FIND OUT WHO DID THIS.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.284
- COME ON, FIN.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.432
- OH, YEAH.
RIGHT THERE, I LIKE THAT.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.501
- LADIES!

16:41.534 --> 16:44.237
I NEED THE ROOM.
- WHAT THE--OH, HELL, NO.

16:44.271 --> 16:47.374
- PEARLIE, HUH?
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.643
- I GOT SCIATICA.
- WHAT'S THAT, THAI...

16:50.677 --> 16:52.379
FOR HAPPY ENDING?

16:52.412 --> 16:56.416
- UH-HUH. GOTCHA.
WHAT DO WE GOT OVER HERE?

16:56.449 --> 16:58.551
- COME ON, MAN.
YOU KNOW I CAN'T CARRY.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.353
I'M ON PAROLE.
- PAROLE?

17:00.387 --> 17:02.355
OH! NOT FOR LONG.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.492
UNLESS YOU WANNA TELL US WHY
ESCOBAR'S GIRLFRIEND CALLED YOU.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.260
- WHATEVER IT WAS,

17:07.294 --> 17:09.296
I TOLD THAT BITCH
I WASN'T INTERESTED, BRAH.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.198
DUDE IS CRAZY.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.732
- CRAZY ENOUGH
TO PUT OUT HITS ON NYPD?

17:12.765 --> 17:14.501
- CRAZY ENOUGH.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.237
YOU COME IN HERE AND WANNA
BUST ME FOR A GUN YOU PLANTED?

17:17.270 --> 17:20.240
MAN, DO YOUR THING, DOG.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.575
DAMN!

17:22.609 --> 17:25.512
- NOW YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT ESCOBAR?

17:25.545 --> 17:27.347
- YOU WANT ME TO TALK?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.416
LISTEN, THIS MAN
WILL PEEL MY FACE OFF,

17:29.449 --> 17:31.384
SEW IT ONTO A SOCCER BALL,

17:31.418 --> 17:33.386
AND KICK IT
INTO MY MOTHER'S YARD.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.688
SO MIGHT AS WELL
GO AHEAD AND SHOOT ME.

17:35.722 --> 17:39.092
'CAUSE I AIN'T NO SNITCH,

17:45.298 --> 17:46.399
- WHO'S THE SHOOTER?

17:46.433 --> 17:48.268
- NOBODY I KNOW, MAN.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.536
[grunts]

17:49.569 --> 17:51.538
- WHO'S THE SHOOTER?

17:51.571 --> 17:53.106
- YOUR PARTNER'S CRAZY, MAN!

17:53.140 --> 17:55.475
[grunts]

17:55.508 --> 17:57.177
YOU'RE GONNA GO DOWN
FOR THIS, MAN!

17:57.210 --> 17:58.411
- YEAH?
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.380
- [grunts]

18:00.413 --> 18:03.283
- PICK HIS PUNK ASS UP!
- COME ON!

18:03.316 --> 18:04.817
- YOU LOVE YOUR SON?

18:04.851 --> 18:06.819
YOU LOVE YOUR SON?

18:06.853 --> 18:10.657
YOU TOUCH MY BOY,
I SWEAR TO GOD I'LL KILL YOU.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.325
- I'M ABOUT TO TAKE THIS

18:12.359 --> 18:15.128
AND DIG YOUR EYEBALLS
OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.630
YOU WILL NEVER
SEE YOUR BOY AGAIN.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.599
- JUST DO IT.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.568
- NO, MAN, COME--

18:21.601 --> 18:24.404
[buzzer]
- HEY--

18:24.437 --> 18:26.273
NOAH, WE JUST NEED
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.141
- YEAH, WELL,
I GOT SOME NEWS.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.376
- WHAT?
- THAT NURSE...

18:29.409 --> 18:34.481
THE ONE HE KNOCKED UP,
SHE JUST GOT SHOT.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.283
- ANA?
- YEAH.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.418
SHE'S DEAD.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.254
ONE SHOT.
STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HEAD.

18:41.288 --> 18:44.224
- NO, MAN.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.393
NO, MAN!

18:46.426 --> 18:48.261
THAT'S ALL I GOT, MAN.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.563
[sobbing]
ALL I GOT.

18:52.365 --> 18:56.369
PLEASE, LORD.

19:05.612 --> 19:05.812
.

19:05.845 --> 19:06.579
- ESCOBAR'S GIRLFRIEND
GETS KILLED,

19:07.880 --> 19:09.316
DOES THAT CLEAR HIM?

19:09.349 --> 19:10.550
- HE REALLY SEEMED
BROKEN UP.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.818
- AND HIS BOY
WAS WITH HER.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.486
HE WOULDN'T RISK
HIM GETTING HURT.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.787
- THE MOTHER'S DEAD,
THE FATHER'S IN JAIL,

19:14.821 --> 19:16.656
BENITO, JR. IS GONNA GO
INTO FOSTER CARE.

19:16.689 --> 19:17.957
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT ESCOBAR WOULD WANT THAT.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.759
- LIEUTENANT EAMES,
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.761
- THIS IS THE THIRD SHOOTING?

19:21.794 --> 19:23.330
LOOKING AT THE SAME M.O.?

19:23.363 --> 19:24.964
- ONE .45, FULL METAL JACKET,

19:24.997 --> 19:28.435
FIRED FROM A PROJECT WINDOW
100 YARDS AWAY.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.337
STILL WAITING
FOR THE BALLISTICS ON THE GUN.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.505
- HOUSING PROJECT?
SO ANY SURVEILLANCE?

19:32.539 --> 19:34.507
- THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
YOU MAY HAVE CAUGHT A BREAK.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.276
THAT PROJECT'S
NEAR A POWER PLANT

19:36.309 --> 19:38.211
THAT'S UNDER JOINT TERRORISM
TASK FORCE SURVEILLANCE.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.280
TARU'S GOING OVER IT
FRAME BY FRAME.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.814
- GREAT,
SO IN THE MEANTIME,

19:41.848 --> 19:43.216
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY
WITH A GRUDGE

19:43.250 --> 19:44.884
AGAINST NYPD AND ESCOBAR.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.519
- A RIVAL GANG.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.988
- FIN, ANYBODY COME TO MIND?

19:49.021 --> 19:52.825
- WE'D JUST BROKEN THE BACK
OF LITTLE WILL MORA'S GANG.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.862
THERE WAS A FULL-SCALE
TURF WAR GOING ON.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.297
- YOUR OLD PARTNER LUIS

19:57.330 --> 19:58.998
MENTIONED KEEPING NOTES
ON YOUR CASES.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.867
- YEAH, YOU KNOW THE TYPE.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.302
HE LIKED TO WRITE THINGS DOWN
WHEN HE GOT HOME.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.003
I WAS NEVER
INTO LEAVING A PAPER TRAIL.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.640
- WELL, GO TAKE A LOOK AT HIS.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.277
- SOMEBODY TOOK OUT ESCOBAR'S
GIRL IN BROAD DAYLIGHT?

20:10.310 --> 20:11.778
THAT'S BADASS.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.913
- WELL, THE GOOD THING
IS THE TERRORIST TASK FORCE

20:13.946 --> 20:16.683
HAS THAT WHOLE AREA ON VIDEO
LOCKED DOWN.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.818
SO WE'RE SURE
TO GET A SOLID PIC.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.487
- TILL THEN,
WE'RE LOOKING FOR GANGSTERS

20:20.520 --> 20:21.788
WHO DIDN'T LIKE ESCOBAR.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.691
- COULD BE BAUTISTA
AND HIS DOMINICAN GANG.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.859
THEY HAD BEEF OVER TURF
IN EAST NEW YORK.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.462
BUT WE PUT THEM AWAY TOO.
[cell phone chimes]

20:29.496 --> 20:30.863
YOU GOT ANY OTHER LEADS?

20:30.897 --> 20:33.700
- THE SHOOTER WAS DEAD-ON
FROM 100 YARDS

20:33.733 --> 20:35.602
WITH A LES BAER PROWLER.

20:35.635 --> 20:38.805
- A LES BAER?
- MM-HMM.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.874
- A NEW ONE?
- NO.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.745
THEY JUST TRACKED IT DOWN.
THIS IS STRANGE.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.615
"LAST REPORTED USED IN
A BRIGHTON BEACH GANG SHOOTING

20:48.648 --> 20:50.917
IN '97."
- '97?

20:50.950 --> 20:53.420
YOU MEAN SOME GUY KEEPS IT
IN HIS DRESSER SINCE THEN

20:53.453 --> 20:55.422
AND PULLS IT OUT NOW?

20:55.455 --> 20:58.425
- LES BAER.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.827
BRIGHTON BEACH.
YEAH, DOESN'T RING A BELL.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.062
- WHAT ABOUT THAT
RUSSIAN MOBSTER PETROVICH?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.764
REMEMBER HIM, LUIS?

21:04.797 --> 21:07.600
- OH, YEAH.
THOSE RUSSIAN CATS.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.035
THE NAMES ARE KINDA HAZY.

21:09.068 --> 21:12.439
LET ME FIND THAT BOX,
GET BACK TO YOU.

21:12.472 --> 21:15.942
- OKAY. WILL DO.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.711
- SO ESCOBAR WARRED
WITH TWO GANGS.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.613
WHICH ONE OF 'EM
IS ON THE HOOK FOR THIS?

21:20.647 --> 21:22.782
- NEITHER.
BAUTISTA'S GONE, SO IS HIS GANG.

21:22.815 --> 21:25.852
- PETROVICH AND HIS PEOPLE
ARE BACK IN MOSCOW,

21:25.885 --> 21:27.854
SMUGGLING WEAPONS,
SEX TRAFFICKING.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.756
LIFE IS GREAT FOR THEM.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.524
- SO HOW DOES A GUN
FROM ONE OF THEIR HITS

21:31.558 --> 21:32.725
SURFACE NOW?

21:32.759 --> 21:34.961
- FIN, DO YOU REMEMBER
THE HIT?

21:34.994 --> 21:37.063
- IT WASN'T MY CASE.
THEY TOOK DOWN A RIVAL DEALER.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.932
LUIS WORKED WITH TWO
UKRAINIAN UNDERCOVERS.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.834
- IS THERE ANY WAY THAT LUIS
WOULD LOOK THE OTHER WAY

21:41.868 --> 21:43.069
FOR EITHER ONE OF THEM?

21:43.102 --> 21:44.604
- MAYBE POCKETING A PIECE.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.439
NEVER GOING AFTER
ONE OF OUR OWN.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.342
- I SAW LUIS' FACE
WHEN WE TOLD HIM IT A LES BAER.

21:49.376 --> 21:52.979
I MEAN, IT HIT A NERVE.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.814
- OKAY.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.816
OKAY, FIN,
YOU GO SOUND OUT LUIS.

21:56.849 --> 22:00.086
YOU TWO TRACK DOWN
THE UCs.

22:00.119 --> 22:03.656
- PETROVICH GO BACK
TO MOTHER RUSSIA?

22:03.690 --> 22:07.760
- ALL OF HIS PEOPLE
ARE EITHER DEAD OF BEHIND BARS.

22:07.794 --> 22:10.797
- OR BILLIONAIRES.
[laughing]

22:10.830 --> 22:12.432
MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE
WORKED FOR HIM

22:12.465 --> 22:14.701
WHEN WE HAD THE CHANCE.

22:14.734 --> 22:17.437
- I BEEN WONDERING
IF ANYBODY ELSE EVER DID.

22:17.470 --> 22:20.440
- HOW'S THAT?

22:20.473 --> 22:22.675
- REMEMBER THOSE
TWO UKRAINIAN UCs,

22:22.709 --> 22:25.812
LISKO AND MASTEL?

22:25.845 --> 22:28.715
NYPD SAYS THEY'RE OFF THE GRID.
YOU EVER HEAR FROM THEM?

22:28.748 --> 22:30.650
- ONCE.

22:30.683 --> 22:34.854
THEY SENT ME A CONDOLENCE CARD
WHEN RITA PASSED.

22:34.887 --> 22:35.988
THEY'RE IN EUROPE,

22:36.022 --> 22:38.758
WORKING FOR INTERPOL
OR SOMETHING.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.793
FIN...

22:40.827 --> 22:43.530
I SPENT MORE TIME WITH YOU

22:43.563 --> 22:46.699
THAN I DID WITH MY WIFE.

22:46.733 --> 22:49.502
NOW YOU WANNA
ASK ME SOMETHING.

22:49.536 --> 22:50.837
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK IT?

22:50.870 --> 22:53.806
- OKAY.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.776
THAT LES BAER PISTOL.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.178
THINK ONE OF THOSE GUYS
MIGHT'VE PICKED IT UP?

22:59.211 --> 23:00.813
- NO. NO WAY.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.682
- HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

23:02.715 --> 23:04.817
- 'CAUSE I DID.

23:18.665 --> 23:21.668
ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANNA ASK ME?

23:25.638 --> 23:27.874
- I BEEN TRYING TO GET A SHOT
ON ROLLINS FOR WEEKS,

23:27.907 --> 23:30.042
I HEARD ABOUT THE PERP WALK.

23:30.076 --> 23:33.780
I FIRED FROM A ROOFTOP ACROSS
THE STREET FROM THE PRECINCT.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.615
- HOW'D YOU EVEN
GET UP THERE?

23:35.648 --> 23:37.517
- ROLLINS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:37.550 --> 23:39.752
- WELL, I'M ALL CAUGHT UP
ON DUCK DYNASTY.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.921
I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.824
HEARD ABOUT
THE LIEUTENANT'S SON, I'M SORRY.

23:44.857 --> 23:47.159
THAT'S YOUR OLD PARTNER?
- YEAH.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.862
- THAT ROOFTOP,
FROM 100 YARDS?

23:49.896 --> 23:53.766
- ARMY SNIPER.
BEST IN MY CLASS.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.703
THEN THAT NIGHT, SAME SHOT.
THE LIEUTENANT'S SON.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.538
ROOFTOP ACROSS
FROM HIS APARTMENT.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.106
- ANA TEJADA?

24:00.139 --> 24:03.910
- FIFTH FLOOR LANDING.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.945
I WANTED TO WAIT...

24:05.978 --> 24:07.614
TILL SHE PUT
HER LITTLE BOY DOWN,

24:07.647 --> 24:09.816
BUT I HAD TO FIRE...
BEFORE SOMEBODY CAME.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.251
ONE SHOT EACH TIME.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.153
ONE FOR EACH WRONG.

24:14.186 --> 24:17.456
- OKAY, THOSE WRONGS...

24:21.160 --> 24:22.962
TELL ME ABOUT THOSE WRONGS.

24:27.199 --> 24:31.504
- ESCOBAR PUT ME
ON DISABILITY.

24:31.538 --> 24:34.841
I LOST MY JOB.

24:34.874 --> 24:39.912
MY WIFE DIDN'T GET THE MEDICAL
ATTENTION SHE DESERVED...

24:39.946 --> 24:41.548
DIES IN PAIN.

24:41.581 --> 24:44.551
AND HE GETS CONJUGAL VISITS

24:44.584 --> 24:47.286
AND HIS SON IS ON MEDICAID?

24:47.319 --> 24:50.723
HOW IS THAT RIGHT?
- OKAY.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.592
I GET THAT.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.126
BUT...

24:54.160 --> 24:56.896
WHY SHOOT ROLLINS?

24:56.929 --> 24:59.532
I MEAN,
YOU NEVER EVEN MET HER.

24:59.566 --> 25:01.834
- FIN TURNED HIS BACK ON ME.

25:01.868 --> 25:04.070
HE DIDN'T COME
TO MY WIFE'S FUNERAL,

25:04.103 --> 25:07.073
BUT HE'S GOT TIME FOR HER.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.842
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS,
AMANDA.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.177
I DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.812
MAYBE IF I'D HAVE WENT
AND SEEN HIM MORE,

25:12.845 --> 25:14.213
GONE TO THE PAROLE HEARING.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.682
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.049
ARE YOU SURE HE'S OUR GUY?

25:17.083 --> 25:18.851
- PLEASE DON'T GO AMARO ON ME.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.720
- HE'S GOT MOTIVE.

25:20.753 --> 25:21.854
HE'S KNOWS ALL THE DETAILS
ABOUT THE SHOOTINGS.

25:21.888 --> 25:25.024
- HE'S ALSO GOT
A POLICE SCANNER.

25:25.057 --> 25:28.928
THE GUY THAT SHOT ME
DISAPPEARED FAST FROM A ROOF.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.830
HE'S ON DISABILITY.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.965
- AMANDA,
HE HANDED ME THE GUN.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.667
- DOESN'T MEANT
HE'S THE SHOOTER.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.268
ANYONE ELSE HAVE ACCESS
TO THE WEAPON?

25:36.302 --> 25:38.137
- I DON'T KNOW,
HIS DAUGHTER GLORIA.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.906
- HOW OLD IS SHE?
- 25.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.641
SHE'S IN THE POLICE ACADEMY.

25:41.674 --> 25:42.975
- HER MOTHER JUST DIED.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.244
SHE WAS HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH THE INSURANCE.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.847
- COME ON, EVERYBODY HAS
PROBLEMS WITH THE INSURANCE.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.783
I'M SICK THAT IT'S HIM,
BUT WE GOT OUR MAN.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.819
- THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.
THE MOTIVES, IT JUST--

25:52.852 --> 25:54.821
- WELL, HE'S ANGRY.
YOU HEARD HIM.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.989
- YEAH, AT FIN, AT ESCOBAR,
THE LIEUTENANT.

25:57.023 --> 25:59.792
- THEN HOW COME NONE OF THEM
ARE THE ONES THAT GOT HIT?

25:59.826 --> 26:03.162
THE TARGETS ARE ALWAYS
NEXT OF KIN, PARTNERS.

26:03.195 --> 26:06.799
YOU KNOW, MAYBE SHE IS TRYING TO
MAKE THE PEOPLE SHE'S ANGRY AT

26:06.833 --> 26:09.902
HURT THE WAY SHE GOT HURT
WHEN HER FATHER GOT SHOT.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.238
- NOT GLORIA.
SHE'S A SWEET KID.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.140
- OH, BOY.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.876
DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS
KICKED OUT OF THE ACADEMY

26:16.909 --> 26:21.748
ON PSYCHOLOGICAL
TWO MONTHS AGO?

26:21.781 --> 26:23.983
- LUIS WOULD'VE TOLD US THAT.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.818
- WELL, MAYBE HE DIDN'T KNOW.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.954
- THE LES BAER.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.056
WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE GUN,
HE MUST'VE PIECED IT TOGETHER.

26:30.089 --> 26:33.292
- HE TOOK A BULLET FOR YOU.

26:33.325 --> 26:36.228
DON'T YOU THINK HE'D TAKE ONE
FOR HIS DAUGHTER?

26:41.701 --> 26:43.903
- LET'S FIND HER
AND FIND OUT.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.809
[sirens blaring]

26:54.080 --> 26:56.348
- THAT GLORIA'S CAR?

26:56.382 --> 27:01.320

WITH A BURNT BODY INSIDE.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.389
- THAT HER?
- MAYBE.

27:03.422 --> 27:06.926
- OR SHE WANTS US
TO THINK IT IS.

27:19.672 --> 27:19.872
.

27:19.906 --> 27:20.372
- GLORIA MONTERO IS 25.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.175
SHE WAS RECENTLY EXPELLED
FROM THE POLICE ACADEMY.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.711
SHE'S ARMY TRAINED.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.779
TOOK A GENERAL DISCHARGE
TWO YEARS AGO.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.015

HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED

27:29.048 --> 27:32.418
AS YOLANDA BROOKS,
A TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT AGENT

27:32.451 --> 27:34.787
WHO TICKETED
MONTERO'S VEHICLE.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.923
- MONTERO'S A HIGHLY
EFFICIENT MARKSMAN.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.825
DAUGHTER
OF A RETIRED DETECTIVE.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.727
SHE KNOWS HOW WE THINK,
HOW WE WORK.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.261
SHE'S KNOWN
TO HAVE PURCHASED

27:42.294 --> 27:44.831
SEVERAL AUTOMATIC WEAPONS
IN PHILLY AT A GUN SHOW

27:44.864 --> 27:47.066
AFTER HER DISMISSAL
FROM THE ACADEMY.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.701
- WE HAVE A REPORT
OF A WHITE DELIVERY VAN,

27:48.735 --> 27:50.002
STOLEN IN THE AREA.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.337
WE HAVE THE PLATE NUMBER OUT

27:51.370 --> 27:52.939
ON THE LICENSE
RECOGNITION SYSTEM.

27:52.972 --> 27:55.141
- SHE IS TO BE CONSIDERED
ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.715
HERE YOU ARE.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.454
- WHAT'S THIS?
- YOU'RE FREE TO GO, DETECTIVE.

28:08.487 --> 28:11.357
YOU CAN'T RELEASE ME.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.860
I CONFESSED.
I'M THE SHOOTER.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.127
BOOK ME.

28:15.161 --> 28:18.464
- COME ON, LUIS.
IT'S OVER, MAN.

28:18.497 --> 28:23.002
WE GOT GLORIA ON VIDEO.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.370
THIS IS HER LEAVING THE SCENE

28:24.403 --> 28:28.207
WHERE ESCOBAR'S GIRLFRIEND
WAS SHOT.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.742
- SO WHAT?

28:29.776 --> 28:32.044
- SO WE GET IT,
THAT'S WHY YOU CONFESSED.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.345
YOU KNEW WE'D GO THROUGH
THAT FOOTAGE,

28:33.379 --> 28:35.147
FIND HER EVENTUALLY.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.850
- I CONFESSED
BECAUSE I DID IT.

28:37.884 --> 28:40.419
I TOOK A BULLET.
GOT SCREWED BY THE DEPARTMENT.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.154
I LOST MY WIFE.

28:42.188 --> 28:47.794
- YEAH, AND GLORIA--
SHE LOST HER MOTHER, RIGHT?

28:47.827 --> 28:51.363
GLORIA WAS TEN
WHEN YOU GOT SHOT.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.564
- YES. ABOUT THAT.

28:52.598 --> 28:55.434
- IT MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY
DEVASTATION FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

28:55.467 --> 28:59.005
DEPRESSED DAD,
DISABLED DAD MOST OF HER LIFE.

28:59.038 --> 29:02.875
- THEN HER MOTHER GETS SICK.
SHE GETS STRESSED OUT.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.410
SHE FALLS APART.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.979
ARMY DOESN'T HELP,
THEY KICK HER OUT.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.380
- IT WASN'T DISHONORABLE.

29:08.414 --> 29:09.916
SHE GOT HERSELF
INTO THE ACADEMY.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.350
- YEAH,
AND WHEN HER MOTHER DIED,

29:11.383 --> 29:12.418
SHE GOT BOUNCED BACK OUT.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.486
- YOU LIED TO US ABOUT THAT.
- I JUST FOUND OUT.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.155
- WHEN?

29:16.188 --> 29:18.257
WHEN YOU CONFRONTED HER
ABOUT THE LES BAER?

29:18.290 --> 29:20.126
- 'CAUSE LAST NIGHT,
WE FOUND HER CAR BURNT OUT

29:20.159 --> 29:23.262
IN QUEENS WITH THE BODY
OF A TRAFFIC OFFICER INSIDE.

29:23.295 --> 29:26.332
OKAY, WE APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO PROTECT YOUR DAUGHTER.

29:26.365 --> 29:30.870
BUT RIGHT NOW, SHE IS THE TARGET
OF A MASSIVE MANHUNT.

29:30.903 --> 29:33.039
ESU, NYPD--

29:33.072 --> 29:35.407
THEY'RE GOING AFTER SOMEBODY
WHO SHOT A COP.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.944
YOU KNOW
THAT DOESN'T END WELL.

29:43.115 --> 29:47.553
- THOSE THINGS YOU SAID,
THAT'S NOT MY DAUGHTER.

29:47.586 --> 29:51.924
OKAY?
THAT'S NOT MY DAUGHTER.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.893
I KNOW MY RIGHTS.

29:53.926 --> 29:57.296
YOU WANNA KEEP TALKING,
I WANT A LAWYER.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.502
- LUIS GIVE US ANYTHING?

30:03.535 --> 30:05.838

HIS GUILT.

30:05.872 --> 30:07.373
- WHICH MEANS HE'S TRYING
TO BUY TIME FOR HIS DAUGHTER.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.541
- HEY, WE GOT A SIGHTING!
WE GOT A SIGHTING!

30:09.575 --> 30:12.111

SHE'LL NEVER GET ON A PLANE.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.883
- OR HOWARD BEACH,
THE HOSPITAL.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.918
- HOSPITAL? THAT'S BEEN CLOSED
SINCE HURRICANE SANDY.

30:18.951 --> 30:21.187
- THAT'S WHERE
HER MOTHER DIED.

30:21.220 --> 30:24.256
- OKAY, YOU TWO, GO!
- YES.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.992
- EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP.

[sirens blaring]

30:36.903 --> 30:39.338

ONE BULLET TO THE HEAD.

30:41.473 --> 30:44.176
CLEAN, THROUGH THE GLASS.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.378
- MUST'VE SHOT HER WAY INSIDE.

30:46.412 --> 30:49.648
[sirens blaring]
- IT'S A BIG COMPLEX.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.884
- LET'S START
WITH THE ONCOLOGY WARD.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.901
[faint talking in distance]

31:08.935 --> 31:10.569
[whiserping]
DO YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

31:10.602 --> 31:12.871
- IT'S THIS WAY.

31:17.476 --> 31:22.081

31:22.114 --> 31:24.616

31:24.650 --> 31:28.254
I CONSIDER MYSELF A GOOD PERSON,
A LOVING DAUGHTER,

31:28.287 --> 31:30.556
AND A RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN.

31:30.589 --> 31:33.592
THE ACTIONS I HAVE TAKEN
ARE A LAST RESORT

31:33.625 --> 31:35.661
TO ADDRESS
THE UNCONSCIONABLE MISTREATMENT

31:35.694 --> 31:37.396
THAT MY FAMILY HAS SUFFERED

31:37.429 --> 31:41.433
AT THE HANDS OF THE NYPD
AND OTHER BUREAUCRACIES."

31:41.467 --> 31:43.635
IN OCTOBER OF 1998,

31:43.669 --> 31:47.974
MY FATHER,
DETECTIVE LUIS RAFA MONTERO,

31:48.007 --> 31:51.110
WAS SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES
DURING AN UNDERCOVER OPERATION.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.645
DRUG LORD BENITO ESCOBAR

31:53.679 --> 31:57.616
WAS ABOUT TO ASSASSINATE
DETECTIVE ODAFIN TUTUOLA,

31:57.649 --> 32:00.552
WHEN MY FATHER HEROICALLY
THREW HIMSELF ON THE WEAPON

32:00.586 --> 32:02.989
AND SAVED HIS PARTNER'S LIFE.

32:03.022 --> 32:05.657
MY FATHER WAS GIVEN
A DISABILITY RETIREMENT,

32:05.691 --> 32:07.459
BUT HE NEVER RECOVERED.

32:07.493 --> 32:10.997
HE FELL INTO A DEPRESSION
AND BEGAN DRINKING.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.365
IN THE SPRING OF 2007,

32:13.399 --> 32:17.403
MY MOTHER WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH STAGE TWO BREAST CANCER.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.238
WHEN I ASKED THE ARMY
FOR TIME OFF

32:19.271 --> 32:21.573
TO DEAL WITH MY MOTHER'S
DECLINING HEALTH,

32:21.607 --> 32:25.444
THEY TOLD ME THAT DUE TO MY
"INABILITY TO PERFORM MY DUTIES"

32:25.477 --> 32:28.680
I WOULD BE OFFERED
A GENERAL DISCHARGE.

32:28.714 --> 32:31.717
TO HELP COVER THE COST
OF MY MOTHER'S MEDICAL BILLS,

32:31.750 --> 32:34.253
MY FATHER TOOK A SECURITY JOB.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.689
HIS FORMER LIEUTENANT,
TONI ANNE HOWARD,

32:37.723 --> 32:40.359
UPON DISCOVERING THIS,

32:40.392 --> 32:41.627
INFORMED ON HIM
TO THE DEPARTMENT,

32:41.660 --> 32:44.430
WHO THEN TERMINATED
HIS DISABILITY BENEFITS.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.633
AS A RESULT, WE COULD NOT
AFFORD MEDICAL TREATMENTS

32:47.666 --> 32:49.635
THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED
MY MOTHER'S LIFE.

32:49.668 --> 32:54.340
EVENTUALLY,
WE LOST OUR HOME, AS WELL.

32:54.373 --> 32:57.709
SHE PASSED AWAY,
IN THIS ROOM,

32:57.743 --> 33:00.079
IN PHYSICAL PAIN
AND EMOTIONAL DISTRESS,

33:00.112 --> 33:02.614
IN AUGUST OF 2012.

33:02.648 --> 33:06.185
A MONTH LATER,
I ENTERED THE POLICE ACADEMY.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.387
I WAS, HOWEVER,
STILL DEPRESSED

33:08.420 --> 33:11.190
OVER MY MOTHER'S DEATH
AND MY FATHER'S DECLINE.

33:11.223 --> 33:14.093
THE ACADEMY,
RATHER THAN OFFER HELP,

33:14.126 --> 33:17.263
EXPELLED ME
WITHOUT DUE PROCESS.

33:17.296 --> 33:21.267
ALL OF YOU
WHO HAVE DESTROYED MY LIFE

33:21.300 --> 33:25.704
WILL SOON KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE
TO LOSE A LOVED ONE.

33:25.737 --> 33:28.307
I HAVE POLICE
AND MILITARY TRAINING.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.542
I KNOW YOUR TACTICS.

33:50.296 --> 33:50.462
.

33:50.496 --> 33:51.263
- SHE'S NOT PICKING UP
THE LANDLINE.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.400
- DO WE EVEN KNOW
IF SHE'S INSIDE?

33:54.433 --> 33:56.402
- NO VISUAL CONFIRMATION.
SHE'S PULLED THE BLINDS.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.837
WE HAVE EYES IN THE BACKYARD,
THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.672
WE'RE WORKING ON
HANDHELD INFRARED.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.674
- HER FATHER SWEARS
THERE'S NO SECOND HOME,

34:02.708 --> 34:04.276
NO OTHER FAMILY IN HER LIFE.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.811
WE'VE GOT UNMARKED CARS
IN FRONT OF HER APARTMENT

34:05.844 --> 34:07.646
AND THE POLICE ACADEMY.

34:07.679 --> 34:10.682
SHE'S A LONER--NO FRIENDS,
NOT A LOT OF PLACES SHE CAN GO.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.651
- OKAY, THE SECURITY FOOTAGE
FROM THE HOSPITAL PARKING

34:12.684 --> 34:14.486
CONFIRMS THAT IT IS
A GREY FORD EXPLORER.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.422
IT IS THE CAR THAT
SHE LEFT THE HOSPITAL IN.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.090
- ONE OTHER THING.

34:18.124 --> 34:19.425
HER FATHER SAYS
SHE HAS A POLICE SCANNER APP

34:19.458 --> 34:20.726
ON HER CELL PHONE.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.328
KEEP THE CHATTER
TO A MINIMUM.

34:22.361 --> 34:25.597
- WHERE'S CAPTAIN CRAGEN?
- MR. HAMILL.

34:25.631 --> 34:26.832
- THE FUGITIVE'S
IN MY HOUSE?

34:26.865 --> 34:28.667
- WE'RE NOT SURE.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.302
SHE WAS REPORTED DRIVING A CAR
THAT'S ACROSS THE STREET.

34:30.336 --> 34:32.104
- OH, MY GOD.

34:32.138 --> 34:33.305
WHAT WOULD THIS WOMAN
WANT WITH US?

34:33.339 --> 34:34.540
- SHE USED TO LIVE
IN YOUR HOUSE.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.642
- I HAVE TO GO IN THERE!
- WHOA, WHOA!

34:36.675 --> 34:38.177
- THAT'S NOT HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW, MR. HAMILL.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.312
- LISTEN, WE NEED YOU
TO TRY TO CALL YOUR WIFE.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.114
NOBODY IS PICKING UP
THE LANDLINE.

34:42.148 --> 34:44.350
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU TRIED HER?

34:44.383 --> 34:46.385
- ON THE WAY HERE, FOUR TIMES.
I HAVE TO GO IN--

34:46.418 --> 34:48.754
- JUST...
TRY DIALING AGAIN, MR. HAMILL.

34:48.787 --> 34:52.758
WOULD YOU DO THAT?

34:52.791 --> 34:54.626
[phone ringing]
- I SHOULD PICK IT UP.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.596
IT'S MY HUSBAND.
HE'S GONNA BE WORRIED.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.298
- DON'T MOVE!
[phone ringing]

34:59.331 --> 35:01.767
- PLEASE JUST LET
MY LITTLE BOY GO, PLEASE.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.503
[boy crying]
- BE QUIET!

35:06.672 --> 35:08.140
WHO IS THIS?

35:08.174 --> 35:09.808
- I'D JUST LIKE
TO SPEAK TO MY WIFE.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.277
- FIND OUT IF EVERYONE'S OKAY.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.312
- OH, YOU GOT
A HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR THERE?

35:13.345 --> 35:14.813
SHE TELLING YOU WHAT TO SAY?

35:14.846 --> 35:16.748
- MY WIFE IS PREGNANT.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.584
PLEASE JUST TELL ME
IF SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.387
- SHE'S GOT A NICE HOUSE.

35:21.420 --> 35:22.754
SHE'S FINE.

35:22.788 --> 35:25.257
- I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOUR HOUSE.

35:25.291 --> 35:28.727
- IT'S NOT MINE,
IT'S MY FATHER'S.

35:28.760 --> 35:32.564
I WANNA TALK TO HIM.

35:32.598 --> 35:34.333
- YOU CAN TALK TO HER,
BUT THAT'S ALL.

35:34.366 --> 35:35.534
- CAN I AT LEAST TRY
TO GO IN?

35:35.567 --> 35:38.437
- THEY WON'T LET YOU.
- CAPTAIN.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.372
- KEEP HER CALM.

35:40.406 --> 35:42.841
TELL HER WE'LL WAIT
AS LONG AS THEY NEED TO.

35:42.874 --> 35:46.245
IF THEY NEED ANYTHING--
FOOD--

35:48.847 --> 35:50.682
- GLORIA, HONEY.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.324
- HI, DADDY.

35:58.357 --> 36:01.527
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:01.560 --> 36:04.963
- I REALLY SCREWED UP.

36:04.996 --> 36:09.568
- NO! NO, NO, BABY.
JUST, UM--

36:09.601 --> 36:12.538
JUST LET THOSE PEOPLE OUT,
OKAY?

36:12.571 --> 36:14.906
- THEY'LL SHOOT ME
LIKE A DOG IF I DO.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.709
- NO, NO, NO, SWEETIE.
LISTEN TO ME.

36:17.743 --> 36:20.446
I'M NOT GONNA LET
ANYBODY DO THAT TO YOU.

36:20.479 --> 36:23.282
- THEY WON'T EVEN LET YOU
COME IN TO SEE ME.

36:23.315 --> 36:26.385
I'M SORRY.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.254
I'M SO SORRY.

36:28.287 --> 36:31.823
- NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S MINE, OKAY?

36:31.857 --> 36:34.826
IT'S MINE.
I PUT TOO MUCH ON YOU.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.329
I-I DIDN'T SEE
WHAT IT WAS DOING TO YOU.

36:37.363 --> 36:41.433
- IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT,
DADDY.

36:41.467 --> 36:44.403
IT'S HIS.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.872
IS HE WITH YOU?

36:46.905 --> 36:48.874
- WHO?

36:48.907 --> 36:53.412
- FIN.

36:53.445 --> 36:56.415
THE ONE YOU TOOK
A BULLET FOR.

36:56.448 --> 37:00.986
- YEAH.
YEAH, BABY, HE'S HERE.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.754
- I HAVE A GUN
ON THE LITTLE BOY.

37:02.788 --> 37:05.291
- MOMMY!

37:05.324 --> 37:06.592
[crying]

37:06.625 --> 37:08.294
- YOU TELL HIM
TO COME INSIDE

37:08.327 --> 37:11.263
OR I'LL SHOOT THE BOY
AND HIS MOTHER.

37:11.297 --> 37:14.466
- WE CAN WAIT THIS OUT.
- TILL SHE SHOOTS 'EM?

37:14.500 --> 37:16.868
- WE'LL BE LISTENING IN.
WE'LL HAVE BACKUP ADJACENT.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.470
WE CAN BE THROUGH THAT DOOR
IN SECONDS.

37:18.504 --> 37:20.772
- I CAN HANDLE IT.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.776
- FIN.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.612
YOU KNOW NONE OF THIS
IS ON YOU, RIGHT?

37:26.645 --> 37:28.647
- DO I?

38:01.513 --> 38:03.782
GLORIA, IT'S JUST ME.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.817
- LOCK THE DOOR!

38:08.720 --> 38:11.490
- OKAY, THE DOOR'S LOCKED.

38:11.523 --> 38:14.860
[boy crying]

38:21.066 --> 38:23.469
PUT THE GUN DOWN, GLORIA.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.103
- GOOD IDEA.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.406
WAIT LET ME SHOOT THEM FIRST.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.341
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
DON'T SHOOT THEM, OKAY?

38:29.375 --> 38:31.410
IF YOU'RE GONNA SHOT ANYBODY,
SHOOT ME.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.381
- OH, I WILL.

38:43.088 --> 38:44.790
- GO AHEAD,
GET IT OVER WITH.

38:44.823 --> 38:47.459
I'M THE ONE THAT DESERVES IT.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.695
- YOU FEELING GUILTY?

38:49.728 --> 38:53.064
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU WANT ME
TO SHOOT YOU.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.467
- I WAS SUPPOSED TO DIE
15 YEARS AGO

38:55.501 --> 38:57.102
FROM A BULLET TO THE HEAD.

38:57.135 --> 38:59.070
OKAY, THE ONE
THAT YOUR FATHER TOOK.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.473
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT,

39:01.507 --> 39:04.610
I BEEN PLAYING
WITH HOUSE MONEY.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.612
YOUR FATHER'S A GOOD MAN,
GLORIA.

39:06.645 --> 39:11.483
IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM, I WOULD'VE
NEVER SAW MY SON GROW UP.

39:11.517 --> 39:14.653
- BECAUSE OF YOU
AND THE NYPD,

39:14.686 --> 39:17.122
MY FATHER LOST EVERYTHING.

39:17.155 --> 39:21.159
THIS HOUSE, MY MOTHER.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.795
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FAMILY,
I DIDN'T KNOW.

39:23.829 --> 39:27.165
I SHOULD HAVE.
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN TOUCH.

39:27.198 --> 39:30.902
- YOU DIDN'T CALL,
YOU DIDN'T CARE.

39:30.936 --> 39:33.104
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
MY MOTHER WAS SICK.

39:33.138 --> 39:35.607
- I DIDN'T WANNA TALK
TO YOUR FATHER, OKAY?

39:35.641 --> 39:37.743
YOU'RE RIGHT, I WAS GUILTY.

39:37.776 --> 39:40.412
I DIDN'T WANNA THINK
THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM

39:40.446 --> 39:42.113
COULD'VE BEEN ME.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.650
GLORIA, I CAN'T UNDO
WHAT HAPPENED.

39:44.683 --> 39:49.888
I CAN'T MAKE IT BETTER.
BUT I AM SORRY.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.657
- YOU SHOULD
TELL MY FATHER THAT.

39:51.690 --> 39:54.893
- WE CAN BOTH DO IT.
HE'S RIGHT OUTSIDE.

39:54.926 --> 39:58.063
COME ON,
JUST PUT THE GUN DOWN.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.832
GIVE IT TO ME.
I DON'T WANNA LET THEM KILL YOU.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.134
OKAY?

40:03.168 --> 40:05.771
LET ME TAKE YOU OUTSIDE.
I'LL BE YOUR BODYGUARD.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.172
COME ON.

40:09.608 --> 40:11.176
[boy sobbing]

40:11.209 --> 40:14.179
- NO.

40:14.212 --> 40:17.949
THEY'LL TAKE YOU OUT TOO.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.952
I'M NOT GETTING
OUT OF HERE ALIVE.

40:20.986 --> 40:22.788
AND NEITHER ARE THEY.

40:22.821 --> 40:25.691
[grunts]

40:25.724 --> 40:26.992
[gunshot]
- [scream]

40:27.025 --> 40:29.127
- GO, GO, GO!

40:29.160 --> 40:31.196
[both struggling]

40:32.731 --> 40:34.466
[door busts open]
- NYPD!

40:34.500 --> 40:35.734
- OKAY, DON'T SHOOT,
DON'T SHOOT!

40:35.767 --> 40:37.168
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
DON'T SHOOT!

40:37.202 --> 40:38.737
NOBODY'S HURT.
NOBODY'S HURT.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.807
LET ME TAKE HER OUT.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.609
COME ON, LET'S GO.

40:46.244 --> 40:49.615
I GOT HER.
- [sniffles]

40:55.921 --> 41:00.526
[sobbing]

41:06.598 --> 41:09.100
DAD...

41:10.235 --> 41:13.739
I--

41:13.772 --> 41:16.141
- LUIS, I'M SORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

41:16.174 --> 41:20.178
- NO. SHE'S ALIVE.
THANK YOU.

41:23.749 --> 41:25.517
- DADDY! DADDY!
- TOMMY!

41:25.551 --> 41:29.087
TOMMY, COME HERE.

41:32.891 --> 41:35.093
- FIN.

41:35.126 --> 41:36.762
- AMANDA!

41:36.795 --> 41:38.597
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.932
- ONCE I HEARD YOU WENT INSIDE,
I HAD TO COME.

41:40.966 --> 41:42.233
YOU WERE THERE FOR ME WHEN--

41:42.267 --> 41:44.636
- WHEN YOU TOOK THE BULLET
FOR ME?

41:44.670 --> 41:47.205
- YEAH, YOU'D DO THE SAME.
IT'S WHAT PARTNERS DO.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.641
[engine starts]

41:51.777 --> 41:53.779
- YEAH.
