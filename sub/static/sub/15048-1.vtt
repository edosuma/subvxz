04:34.450 --> 04:37.570
I'm afraid you're in a red zone.
There's your bank parking.

04:37.828 --> 04:39.453
Oh, I was just letting my husband out.

04:39.705 --> 04:41.157
I just have to cash a cheque, officer.

04:41.182 --> 04:43.478
I appreciate if you let her
sit her for a few minutes..

04:43.668 --> 04:45.744
See, I got this busted ankle.

04:46.170 --> 04:47.795
Listen, why don't you let me park the car,

04:48.005 --> 04:50.543
and then you endorse the cheque
and I'll go in and cash it.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.255
I'll go in and cash my own cheque.
It's my cheque, isn't it?

04:53.469 --> 04:55.877
Now I'm going to endorse it
and cash it myself.

04:56.097 --> 04:58.135
I think he's afraid I'm going
to abscond with the money.

04:58.683 --> 05:01.767
Don't have to be waited on hand or foot
like I was some damn old crock.

05:02.019 --> 05:03.513
Nobody said you're an old crock!

05:03.571 --> 05:04.599
Well, you implied it.

05:04.632 --> 05:07.631
Ok. It's ok. You can park here.

05:07.666 --> 05:09.559
But please make it
as quick as you can.

05:09.652 --> 05:10.919
Much obliged officer.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.589
Marry a hippie and she'll
start endorsing your cheques.

05:34.385 --> 05:37.884
"Colorado, George Adam, 1742".

05:38.219 --> 05:39.219
What?

05:39.974 --> 05:42.050
Plates on that Connie..

05:42.560 --> 05:43.758
What about them?

05:44.395 --> 05:48.345
I don't know.. I'm almost sure I've seen
that number on a hot sheet.

05:48.607 --> 05:50.232
So, run a check on it.

05:52.945 --> 05:55.353
San Miguel 4, requesting a make on

05:55.573 --> 05:58.989
Colorado license:
"George Adam, 1742".

05:59.243 --> 06:00.572
Have a nice day, Rick.

06:00.786 --> 06:01.901
Thank you, Miss Ambar.

06:02.705 --> 06:04.164
- G'morning.
- Good Morning, Sir.

06:07.126 --> 06:09.166
- Could you please endorse this, Sir.
- Oh, sure.

06:11.213 --> 06:14.380
Here, I'll use my own pen. I write
a lil' better with it...

06:14.967 --> 06:16.165
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

06:22.224 --> 06:23.849
Do you have an account here Mr. Pennis?

06:24.101 --> 06:26.224
No but that's a good cheque.

06:26.771 --> 06:30.022
I'm sure it is Mr. Pennis but I'll have
to get an ok from the bank manager.

06:30.774 --> 06:31.805
- Sure.
- Excuse me.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.054
Ms. Vesta.

06:34.054 --> 06:36.773
- What?
- Can we get an ok from Mr. Young on this?

06:43.269 --> 06:44.469
Oh, Yes.

07:07.269 --> 07:08.680
Hello Jessie, San Miguel 4 here.

07:08.938 --> 07:11.227
Have you got anything on
those Colorado plates here?

07:11.440 --> 07:14.062
Not yet. We're still checking.
I'll get right back to you.

07:15.611 --> 07:16.856
- Mr. Pennis?
- Yes, Sir.

07:17.989 --> 07:20.740
I'm sorry Sir, but it's an out-of-state bank.

07:20.950 --> 07:24.401
Oh but that's a bank cashier's cheque, Sir.
What could possibly be wrong with that?

07:24.620 --> 07:28.554
I'm sure it's fine. I'll just have
my secretary check on it. Ms. Vesta.

07:29.176 --> 07:30.112
Yes, Mr. Young.

07:30.137 --> 07:32.343
Would you mind getting on
the phone verifying that...

07:32.372 --> 07:34.099
That's a perfectly good cheque..

07:36.208 --> 07:36.908
Against the wall!

07:37.115 --> 07:38.344
Nobody move!

07:49.520 --> 07:50.599
Keep your hands up!

07:50.980 --> 07:52.573
Ok, open that vault and
nobody'll get hurt..

07:55.735 --> 07:57.443
You wanna die for somebody else's money?

07:57.945 --> 07:58.945
No, but I..

08:03.534 --> 08:04.367
Move it, move it!

08:12.835 --> 08:15.587
San Miguel 4?
This is Pearl. Rudy?

08:15.963 --> 08:18.170
San Miguel 4. Go ahead. Jessie.

08:18.424 --> 08:22.623
Looks like we've got something.
"Colorado, George Adam, 1742"

08:22.636 --> 08:24.909
is a hot plate. It goes with a green Camaro

08:24.963 --> 08:26.758
stolen in Denver on July 7th.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.014
Well, it's on a '72 Continental now.

08:31.270 --> 08:32.385
The Sheriff's on his way.

08:44.158 --> 08:45.321
Is that all?

08:45.534 --> 08:46.534
Where's the money Mister?

08:48.579 --> 08:51.331
That's all.
It's a very small town, Sir.

08:51.540 --> 08:53.083
You're a good dancer?

08:53.292 --> 08:54.455
I don't understand, Sir.

08:54.669 --> 08:57.872
You're dancing sideways!
What are you hiding down there?

08:57.989 --> 08:59.151
Oh, nothing.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.400
Pick it up!

09:07.515 --> 09:10.136
- What's in there?
- Bonds. Non-negotiable bonds.

09:10.151 --> 09:12.640
Better be what you sayin'.

09:13.354 --> 09:14.896
Open it up. Fast!

09:15.078 --> 09:16.078
Yes, Sir.

09:59.129 --> 10:00.229
- G'morning Ma'am.
- G'morning.

10:00.292 --> 10:02.285
May I see your driver's license, please?

10:02.412 --> 10:03.912
Oh, certainly.

10:46.364 --> 10:49.068
Stop the car and put down the hood.
Stop the car.

11:13.224 --> 11:17.886
Look at that Charley! We creamed them!
Hot damn! Creamed pig!

11:18.145 --> 11:20.054
Get this on the emergency band.

11:20.731 --> 11:22.938
There's been a bank robbery
over here in Tres Cruces.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.265
Are you alright Sheriff?

11:24.527 --> 11:28.359
Goddamn shambles!
Two officers down.

11:28.572 --> 11:30.810
We need help. All units
and an ambulance.

11:30.867 --> 11:32.127
- You got that Jessie?
- Yes, Sir.

11:32.785 --> 11:36.533
The suspects were last seen heading south
in a '72 Continental.

11:36.789 --> 11:40.537
Now that's a yellow four door,
with those Colorado plates.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.374
There are 3 occupants.
A woman's driving.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.815
And they're armed and dangerous.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.005
Over and out Jessie.

11:47.842 --> 11:49.585
Are you sure you're alright Sheriff?

12:15.870 --> 12:18.242
- How is he?
- He's alive, anyway.

12:21.542 --> 12:24.413
Stick your neck kid.
Ambulance'll be here in a minute.

12:51.989 --> 12:55.488
I got their license. I got
their license. GA 1472.

12:56.285 --> 12:58.906
No. It's GA 1742.

12:59.163 --> 13:01.915
- Right. GA 1742.
- Thank you.

13:02.124 --> 13:06.204
Sheriff, You have blood on your forehead.
You're not gonna die, are you?

13:07.338 --> 13:08.413
Get along home now son, go on.

13:15.721 --> 13:17.429
Open up there! Sheriff Horton.

13:26.319 --> 13:27.719
How come the gate's locked?

13:27.817 --> 13:28.817
Bust it away!

13:49.463 --> 13:50.744
Keep going honey.

13:53.884 --> 13:55.129
What's the matter Nadine?

13:59.348 --> 14:01.257
Cool it, sweety. It really hurts.

14:03.728 --> 14:04.926
Really hurts!

14:08.357 --> 14:09.686
Easy honey.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.451
Easy. Easy.

14:33.799 --> 14:36.290
Hey, come on Charley.
We just can't sit here all day.

14:39.638 --> 14:42.805
Easy, alright.
We'll get you to a doctor, Nadine.

14:57.865 --> 14:58.865
You know him?

14:59.200 --> 15:00.480
I sure hope not!

15:01.327 --> 15:03.652
Well, I'll identify him soon enough.

15:03.871 --> 15:06.492
As soon as I get a set of prints

15:06.707 --> 15:08.036
and call the FBI.

15:08.793 --> 15:10.785
We're not a Federal Reserve Bank.

15:11.003 --> 15:12.960
They don't have any jurisdiction here.

15:13.214 --> 15:15.621
Oh, better get a hold of the D.A.'s
office then.

15:16.900 --> 15:18.080
- Miss Vesta?!
- Yes?

15:18.594 --> 15:20.634
Call the District Attorney's
office immediately.

15:28.562 --> 15:31.896
Don't let them delay you. Tell them it's
urgent. I'll speak to them at once.

15:32.108 --> 15:33.851
Get me Maynard Boyle in Reno.

15:34.068 --> 15:36.458
I don't care where is or what he's doing.
Get through to him.

15:36.458 --> 15:37.658
Yes, Mister Young!

17:11.707 --> 17:14.659
- Toss it Charley, toss it!
- Careful now, this is black powder.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.599
Don't sweat it. I've blown up a lot of
gooks with this crap and I'm still here.

17:17.800 --> 17:18.800
- Terrific.
- Yeah.

17:42.822 --> 17:44.816
- I'll tell you one thing.
- What's that?

17:45.449 --> 17:48.984
They're pros. No identification at all.

17:49.411 --> 17:52.081
Nothing. Big fat zero.

17:55.084 --> 17:56.578
But we're gonna get 'em

17:57.336 --> 17:59.494
They'll never get out of New Mexico.

17:59.713 --> 18:01.373
Can feel that in my gut.

18:02.758 --> 18:05.380
I'm gonna nail those sons of bitches
to the cross.

18:33.539 --> 18:35.366
She's finished. You know that, don't you?

18:37.585 --> 18:41.713
Listen Charley, You gonna screw around and some
chopper is gonna come and throw a net over us.

19:44.819 --> 19:47.600
- You're right Harman, She's finished.
- Yeah.

19:50.074 --> 19:53.110
All right. Rig the timer. Get the ignitor.
I'll finish with the powder.

19:53.327 --> 19:54.608
No, I'll finish it.

19:54.829 --> 19:58.398
- Just one time. Surprise me and do what I say.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

20:58.434 --> 21:00.142
Charley, I can't get a spark.

21:00.352 --> 21:01.763
Let's see that.

21:01.979 --> 21:03.853
- Oh, you got too big a gap here.
- Yeah.

21:04.607 --> 21:05.887
Here you go, bring this cap in.

21:06.567 --> 21:07.682
See it?

21:08.152 --> 21:09.352
- Alright, did you rig the thank?
- Yeah

21:09.361 --> 21:12.730
Alright. That's it. Close the door and
get the truck started.

22:13.801 --> 22:15.675
Nadine was a hell of a driver Charley!

22:16.971 --> 22:18.346
Yeah. She was.

22:24.353 --> 22:26.926
Damn. This tooth of
mine is killing me.

22:29.525 --> 22:31.103
Thought you took care of that last week.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.029
Yeah, well I... I went to
that dentist of yours.

22:34.238 --> 22:35.981
It was pretty good on me and Nadine.

22:36.198 --> 22:38.238
Real fine Charley.
Lots of luck.

22:43.205 --> 22:45.412
You know, Nadine once told me that..

22:46.125 --> 22:48.367
You and her met at an air circus.

22:48.586 --> 22:50.625
Just her and me in an old biplane.

22:53.174 --> 22:54.205
What'd you do?

22:54.633 --> 22:57.000
Well, she did wing walking.
I did a drunk act.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.530
- A drunk act?
- Yeah.

22:59.555 --> 23:03.683
I came out of the stands dressed like
a drunken sailor waiving a whiskey bottle.

23:04.268 --> 23:05.548
Staggered all over the plane.

23:05.811 --> 23:08.219
Everybody be hollering: "Stop him! Stop him!"

23:08.656 --> 23:10.945
I'd hedge-hop around the field a few times.

23:12.443 --> 23:14.934
And do a flip-over
right in front of the grandstand.

23:15.446 --> 23:17.106
- On its back?
- Yeah.

23:17.364 --> 23:18.479
Crazy Charley!

23:18.908 --> 23:20.865
One day I nearly got killed and...

23:22.870 --> 23:25.112
...figured there must be an easier way.

23:25.331 --> 23:27.730
- Crop dusting.
- Crop dusting.

23:27.770 --> 23:28.194
- Yeah.

23:28.292 --> 23:31.079
Chance to fly. Be independent.

23:31.378 --> 23:32.623
And of course we..

23:34.256 --> 23:35.798
...we couldn't compete with the a...

23:36.008 --> 23:38.751
- The big combines.
- Right.

23:39.705 --> 23:40.305
Yeah.

23:40.387 --> 23:43.009
So we got a hold of you and Al Dutcher.

23:43.933 --> 23:46.803
Decided to see what we could
do about some small banks.

23:47.102 --> 23:48.976
- No trouble.
- Yeah. No trouble.

23:49.939 --> 23:50.939
- Look at that.
- What?

23:52.441 --> 23:53.816
Up ahead.

23:55.301 --> 23:55.801
Yeah.

23:55.803 --> 23:57.083
Play the harmonica.

23:57.088 --> 23:59.080
You know I used to make my
living playing this thing?

23:59.096 --> 24:00.927
- Ok. Play it.
- Professionally.

24:01.283 --> 24:02.694
Just relax.

24:14.630 --> 24:16.290
Sons of bitches are coming back this way.

24:16.757 --> 24:18.963
- What's that for?
- What do you think?

24:19.301 --> 24:20.500
Harman we're crop dusters.

24:20.565 --> 24:24.018
Crop dusters don't wave guns.
Put that thing away. Fast.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.390
Right. Ok.

24:41.740 --> 24:45.441
Any second now there's gonna be one hell of
a bang on that hill. What do we do then?

24:45.661 --> 24:46.989
Just play it by ear Harman.

24:47.204 --> 24:49.826
It that how you got to be
such a big winner Charley?

24:50.666 --> 24:52.109
Don't make any stupid moves, you hear?

24:52.109 --> 24:54.108
Alright, well let me tell you.
He starts snooping

24:54.113 --> 24:56.860
around in the back here, I'm
gonna blow his snout off.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Hi.

25:04.889 --> 25:06.264
Something wrong officer?

25:07.766 --> 25:10.304
- May I see your operator's license, please?
- You bet.

25:17.234 --> 25:18.693
That's me Charley Varrick.

25:18.903 --> 25:22.188
We've been operating out of Reese
since the first of the year.

25:22.406 --> 25:23.948
Thank you very much Mr. Varrick.

25:29.538 --> 25:31.827
Do you mind if I take a look in there?

25:32.541 --> 25:33.704
In there? Sure.

25:38.964 --> 25:40.624
What's in those drums?

25:41.133 --> 25:41.663
In there?

25:42.088 --> 25:45.086
Just uh... Mellifium, Chlordine...

25:45.360 --> 25:48.506
Pesticides, Insecticides, stuff like that...
Herbicides.

25:50.017 --> 25:53.101
Have you been on Tres Cruces' road today?

25:53.395 --> 25:54.676
Why? Something happened?

25:55.731 --> 26:00.274
Now we would get a long a lot better if you
let me ask the questions and you answer.

26:00.486 --> 26:01.486
You bet.

26:02.238 --> 26:06.816
Now what I want is some information
on some people in a yellow '72..

26:14.333 --> 26:16.041
Goddamn!

26:36.438 --> 26:37.683
Goodbye, Nadine!

26:54.473 --> 26:57.279
Wow. I thought I was gonna have
to wax that bastard, sure.

27:09.138 --> 27:10.597
Your gun Harman.

27:11.265 --> 27:13.258
We're a long way from home free.

27:13.475 --> 27:14.886
Give me the piece.

27:24.361 --> 27:28.311
I think we forgot Al Dutcher's gun.

27:43.714 --> 27:44.714
Let's go.

28:35.707 --> 28:39.251
Nadine, we're home Nadine.

28:43.206 --> 28:44.206
Nadine?!

28:47.736 --> 28:49.314
Get that stuff inside.

28:56.662 --> 28:58.240
Didn't see my wife, did you?

28:58.455 --> 29:01.456
No, I didn't see her all day today.

29:01.667 --> 29:04.258
- But I'll keep my eyes peeled.
- Thank you

29:04.378 --> 29:05.541
Very kind of you Mrs. Taft.

29:05.717 --> 29:07.384
Oh, just common courtesy.

29:09.300 --> 29:11.345
You don't suppose she's
run off, do you?

29:11.370 --> 29:12.809
No Ma'am. I don't think so.

29:12.845 --> 29:14.672
Well, you never can tell.

29:14.889 --> 29:17.498
There's macho's all around
this place, you know.

29:17.523 --> 29:20.078
They're after me all the time.
- Yes Ma'am.

29:20.686 --> 29:24.280
- Just don't get any ideas.
- No Ma'am.

29:24.732 --> 29:26.309
The milkman is the worst.

29:26.525 --> 29:29.230
I make him leave his yogurt on the stoop..

29:29.445 --> 29:32.695
...and I don't bring it
in until after he's gone.

29:33.490 --> 29:34.522
That's good thinking.

29:35.743 --> 29:37.616
Excuse me. That's mine.

29:38.537 --> 29:40.936
It's probably an
obscene phone call.

29:41.236 --> 29:42.435
Oh dear.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.026
Listen, you don't have any
whiskey around here, do you?

30:00.059 --> 30:02.948
I'll get you some whiskey in a minute but
I don't want you getting loaded though.

30:03.270 --> 30:05.014
Damn tooth of mine won't quit.

30:05.814 --> 30:07.094
- Still hurts, huh?
- Yeah.

30:08.527 --> 30:11.903
Here, open up that other sack.

31:02.265 --> 31:03.265
Charley!

31:04.450 --> 31:06.079
Charley, come here!

31:06.703 --> 31:07.794
Come here, Charley!

31:08.802 --> 31:10.402
Charley, come here. Quick!

31:14.091 --> 31:17.045
Charley look at this money, will you?
Just look.

31:17.511 --> 31:20.285
These are $50 bills and
$100 bills, Charley.

31:20.306 --> 31:23.093
We done hit the giant,
big daddy jackpot!

31:32.610 --> 31:35.780
What's the matter. You're not gonna
tell me it's counterfeit, are you?

31:36.363 --> 31:37.363
No it's good.

31:37.907 --> 31:40.314
Oh, money! Money! Money!

31:42.077 --> 31:44.533
Oh Lord, Charley, do you know..

31:44.747 --> 31:47.285
...that these are all $100 bills!

31:48.626 --> 31:50.071
How much money you reckon we got here?

31:50.502 --> 31:51.502
I don't know.

31:52.796 --> 31:53.796
Uh... half a million?

31:55.257 --> 31:56.336
Could be.

31:58.594 --> 31:59.709
What's bothering you?

32:01.347 --> 32:03.220
I don't know. Something smells bad.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.200
Charley.

32:06.685 --> 32:10.553
You smell bad. Now, don't you run game
out on me or I'll hang you out to dry.

32:10.773 --> 32:13.171
What's that kind of money
doing in a Tres Cruces bank?

32:13.192 --> 32:14.464
Where should it be?

32:14.860 --> 32:17.019
A bank that size, figures to have maybe...

32:17.321 --> 32:19.420
30... $20,000 in it's stock.

32:19.446 --> 32:21.091
Now listen Charley, Just let
me ask you one question.

32:21.116 --> 32:22.958
- The money was <i>there</i>, right?
-Yeah.

32:22.977 --> 32:24.400
- Now it's <i>here</i>. Right?
- Yeah.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.781
So what's the big deal?

32:25.870 --> 32:27.870
<i>We interrupt this program
with another late bulletin</i>

32:27.930 --> 32:30.968
<i>about the Tres Cruces bank robbery
in which there are 3 known dead</i>

32:31.025 --> 32:33.897
<i>and one sheriff's deputy still
in critical condition.</i>

32:34.213 --> 32:35.956
<i>Harold Young,
Tres Cruces bank manager,</i>

32:36.173 --> 32:39.589
<i>has estimated that the bandits
escaped with less than $2,000.</i>

32:40.010 --> 32:42.600
<i>Sheriff Horton of San Miguel county
predicts an early arrest.</i>

32:42.919 --> 32:44.619
<i>And now back to your programme.</i>

32:45.432 --> 32:46.544
What the hell was that about?

32:46.586 --> 32:47.586
I don't know.

32:48.018 --> 32:49.347
Who are they kidding? Us?

32:50.312 --> 32:52.519
Don't they think we can count?

32:52.731 --> 32:54.605
Doesn't make any sense, unless..

32:55.859 --> 32:56.859
Unless what?

32:57.611 --> 32:59.026
Unless it's a drop.

32:59.280 --> 33:00.226
What's a drop?

33:00.239 --> 33:01.338
Now you know what dirty money is.

33:01.445 --> 33:03.714
That's the kind of money you can't
declare on your income tax.

33:03.909 --> 33:05.932
Now when certain people get
that kind of money what

33:05.957 --> 33:08.022
they do is sent it out of
the country to invest.

33:08.055 --> 33:10.213
- And when it comes back it's clean.
- So?

33:10.332 --> 33:12.906
So maybe that little bank was a drop,
a collection point.

33:13.094 --> 33:15.020
Maybe all this was on its
way out of the country.

33:15.296 --> 33:18.581
Fantastic!
We lucked out!

33:18.841 --> 33:22.673
More like crapped out. It's ten-to-one
this stuff belongs to the Mafia.

33:23.053 --> 33:26.651
This is gambling money, skimmed off
the top, whore money, dope money.

33:26.807 --> 33:27.807
What's the difference?

33:27.891 --> 33:31.092
The difference is that the Mafia kills you.
No trial, no judge.

33:31.103 --> 33:33.641
They'll never stop looking for you.
Not till you're dead.

33:33.897 --> 33:36.729
I'd rather have ten FBI's after me.

33:36.754 --> 33:37.967
Mafia money...

33:38.611 --> 33:42.691
All I wanted was a small take
in and out quick. No big deal.

33:43.001 --> 33:44.445
Well, don't you worry Charley.

33:44.574 --> 33:47.768
'Cause if you don't want your share I'll be
more than happy to take it over for you.

33:48.203 --> 33:49.803
I'm sure you would, Harman!

33:50.122 --> 33:51.865
Well, what do you wanna do?
Give it back?

33:52.007 --> 33:53.418
I've been thinking about it.

33:54.919 --> 33:56.247
Charley Varrick...

34:00.424 --> 34:02.749
Well, I got some news for you Charley.

34:02.968 --> 34:06.302
You haven't got the balls
of a bull canary bird.

34:06.805 --> 34:08.333
And something else...

34:08.415 --> 34:10.578
I ain't giving back
penny number one.

34:10.768 --> 34:11.799
Neither am I!

34:12.018 --> 34:13.168
Then what are we arguing about?

34:13.187 --> 34:14.972
Wouldn't do any good
to give it back.

34:15.385 --> 34:18.670
Nobody takes the Mafia for this kind
of money and lives to tell about it.

34:18.692 --> 34:20.103
They would have to set an example.

34:20.319 --> 34:21.599
They got to find us first.

34:21.820 --> 34:23.896
That's not as hard as it sounds.

34:24.114 --> 34:28.112
Word goes out and every 2-bit hustler
in the world is looking to turn you in.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.118
Yeah, yeah, yeah. <i>La Cosa
Nostra</i> is everywhere.

34:30.329 --> 34:31.492
You better believe it boy.

34:32.039 --> 34:33.617
I believe this.

34:37.670 --> 34:39.538
We're gonna have to keep
pretty quiet for a while.

34:39.663 --> 34:40.485
Is that so?

34:40.839 --> 34:44.339
That's right. Best way to get nailed is
to start tossing that stuff around.

34:44.551 --> 34:46.295
And what's your idea of a while?

34:46.512 --> 34:48.837
3 years. Maybe 4.

34:50.683 --> 34:52.076
Are you telling me...

34:52.420 --> 34:54.815
that I can't spend none of
this money for 3, 4 years?

34:54.937 --> 34:56.132
Right! Right! That's what I'm telling you.

34:56.146 --> 34:58.720
And you'd better lay off that juice too.
That's another way to get nailed.

34:58.745 --> 34:59.702
Me along with you.

35:00.985 --> 35:02.443
- Any more instructions?
- No.

35:03.320 --> 35:06.274
- Nothing more you wanna hang on to me?
- Not right now.

35:07.116 --> 35:10.485
Then I got something I wanna hang on
to you Jimmy Dick.

35:12.955 --> 35:15.624
I've been waiting all my life
to make a score like this.

35:16.041 --> 35:18.579
And now that it's here I
ain't waiting no more.

35:18.794 --> 35:20.452
I mean I'm gonna wail.

35:20.477 --> 35:23.943
And I'm talking about
chicks, cars, clothes.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.788
A box at the races and
beef steak three times a day

35:26.844 --> 35:31.838
and no washed-up, chickenshit son
of a bitch had better try stop me!

35:41.900 --> 35:43.560
Ok kid. You're calling it.

36:21.146 --> 36:22.146
Mrs. Fort

36:22.691 --> 36:25.173
I want a messenger to hand-deliver
an item for me immediately

36:26.236 --> 36:27.236
Bastard.

37:16.704 --> 37:19.989
This morning a Western Fidelity branch Bank

37:20.207 --> 37:22.745
in Tres Cruces, New Mexico

37:22.960 --> 37:26.210
was robbed of roughly 3 quarters
of a million dollars.

37:27.047 --> 37:29.087
The size of the take

37:29.267 --> 37:31.010
plus the urgency of the situation

37:31.927 --> 37:35.972
<i>makes it inevitable that I should call
upon you to become personally involved.</i>

37:37.099 --> 37:39.804
<i>All the arrangements will be
the same as last time.</i>

37:40.227 --> 37:43.561
<i>I hope and fully expect
the same kind of results.</i>

37:44.815 --> 37:49.892
<i>I know you realize the extraordinary
concern here at this end.</i>

37:50.446 --> 37:53.565
<i>So please, expedite. Good luck.</i>

38:21.727 --> 38:24.135
So sorry please. Not open.

38:24.355 --> 38:25.813
I'm here to see Honest John.

38:26.023 --> 38:28.977
Not here please. Try some other time.

38:29.193 --> 38:30.735
I'm Molly.

38:31.820 --> 38:34.276
Mister Molly I'm sorry. Right this way.

39:06.431 --> 39:07.131
Yeah?

39:07.272 --> 39:08.471
Mr. Molly to see you, Sir.

39:08.691 --> 39:09.971
Door's open.

39:16.865 --> 39:18.490
Good to see you, Molly.

39:24.957 --> 39:26.651
Aw.. Lucky shot!

39:26.981 --> 39:28.799
I told you you should have
given me more points.

39:35.342 --> 39:37.418
A pleasure to do business with you Bud.

39:37.636 --> 39:40.803
Thanks, you creep. Next time ten.

39:41.348 --> 39:42.890
Sucker!

39:43.392 --> 39:44.555
Come on in, Molly.

40:08.670 --> 40:09.706
What's the setup?

40:10.085 --> 40:13.086
Our sources haven't had time
to come up with anything yet.

40:13.297 --> 40:15.835
But the word's out.
Something will break.

40:16.091 --> 40:17.467
It always does.

40:19.136 --> 40:20.136
Was that it?

40:20.721 --> 40:22.096
What else can I tell you?

40:23.807 --> 40:25.432
Thanks anyway, Honest John.

40:26.018 --> 40:27.018
What's that for?

40:27.770 --> 40:31.055
Well, you can tell our friend
that I don't work with my head in the bag.

40:31.392 --> 40:32.392
Wait a minute.

40:34.985 --> 40:35.985
I don't get it.

40:36.236 --> 40:39.736
How long was that... roughly 3 quarter of
a million dollars to be in that bank.

40:41.033 --> 40:42.196
A couple of days.

40:42.409 --> 40:43.987
And who knew it was there?

40:44.870 --> 40:48.321
Harold Young, he's the
branch manager out there.

40:48.516 --> 40:51.043
- He knew of course.
- Anyone else?

40:51.710 --> 40:53.418
Undoubtedly Maynard Boyle.

41:07.142 --> 41:11.804
If you should find some sort of leak
inside the organization..

41:13.023 --> 41:15.597
That information would be very valuable.

41:16.318 --> 41:19.355
- Carte Blanche?
- No restrictions, the lid's off.

41:19.697 --> 41:20.942
Very well.

41:29.915 --> 41:32.951
- Do you have any connections in New Mexico?
- No.

41:33.544 --> 41:38.040
You'll be alright here. Deloso
take and deliver messages.

41:43.220 --> 41:44.714
What about transportation?

41:44.930 --> 41:48.264
A maroon Chrysler Imperial.
Clean, all souped up.

41:48.475 --> 41:51.642
240 on a straight
away, guaranteed.

41:51.854 --> 41:52.968
Sounds reasonable.

41:53.188 --> 41:56.889
It's all yours but there's a problem:
It's a repossession.

41:57.109 --> 41:58.437
It's no problem.

41:58.652 --> 41:59.767
Let's go!

42:12.416 --> 42:13.579
There it is.

42:40.613 --> 42:41.613
Hey!

42:45.366 --> 42:46.398
Hush sonny,

42:46.458 --> 42:49.634
I'm gonna get you a brand new puppy.
Didn't I promise you? Didn't I?

42:54.801 --> 42:56.255
Hey Mister.

42:56.280 --> 42:59.025
 I don't want no problem so I'm
asking you in a very nice way

42:59.025 --> 43:01.174
just to keep your hands
off that automobile.

43:01.590 --> 43:02.590
You Randolph Percy?

43:02.633 --> 43:05.206
Looks Mister, you caught me on a bad
day so just stay outta my face!

43:05.511 --> 43:07.474
Well, you owe six months
payment on this car, Sir.

43:07.930 --> 43:09.009
I owe?

43:10.599 --> 43:11.678
I owe, uh?

43:11.892 --> 43:14.886
That <i>Chink</i> son of a bitch
burned me outta $2500

43:14.895 --> 43:17.386
And I told him when I get my
money back he gets his car.

43:17.815 --> 43:19.060
Look, I'm repossessing
the vehicle Mr. Percy.

43:19.316 --> 43:20.910
You pink ass punk, you...

43:26.699 --> 43:29.272
There are very few men that
speak to me in that tone.

43:31.078 --> 43:32.702
A few <i>Caucasians</i>.

43:34.164 --> 43:35.908
but no <i>Negros</i> at all.

44:02.609 --> 44:03.807
Hey, Harman!

44:04.403 --> 44:05.403
Yeah?!

44:06.447 --> 44:09.613
10 o'clock news is about to come on.
You said you wanted to see it.

44:09.825 --> 44:12.316
- Damn straight I do!
- Alright. Come on!

44:12.536 --> 44:14.230
It's my favorite program.

44:15.127 --> 44:16.994
Current events and all that.

44:17.421 --> 44:20.688
Current events used to be my
favorite subject in school.

44:22.713 --> 44:27.495
Hey Charlie. I bet you don't know
what the capital of West Virginia is.

44:28.020 --> 44:30.751
- Charleston
- Charleston's, right.

44:36.602 --> 44:37.266
Where is the money?

44:37.478 --> 44:39.020
It's in there.

44:40.439 --> 44:41.850
In the closet.

44:45.569 --> 44:46.849
- Did you count it?
- Yeah.

44:49.198 --> 44:50.198
How much?

44:50.616 --> 44:54.364
$765,118, even.

44:59.666 --> 45:02.336
I thought I'd never live
to see that much money.

45:03.504 --> 45:04.962
Never mind have it, for my own.

45:05.172 --> 45:06.370
- One third.
- Huh?

45:07.132 --> 45:09.255
One-third is yours.
Two-thirds is mine.

45:09.635 --> 45:13.549
Sure, good buddy. Sure.
That's what I meant.

45:15.599 --> 45:16.899
We're missing the news.

45:20.938 --> 45:23.263
<i>...negotiations continue on a 24 hour basis.</i>

45:23.482 --> 45:27.432
<i>Union spokesmen say a final solution
to the disagreements with City officials..</i>

45:27.653 --> 45:30.226
<i>Appears to remain several days away.</i>

45:30.864 --> 45:32.691
<i>At this hour a brush and timber fire</i>

45:32.908 --> 45:36.242
<i>continues to smolder, 6
miles south of Tres Cruces,</i>

45:36.495 --> 45:38.369
<i>in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo.</i>

45:38.580 --> 45:40.538
<i>About a thousand acres have burnt in the fire</i>

45:40.749 --> 45:43.074
<i>but authorities say it is now under control.</i>

45:43.293 --> 45:46.211
<i>And there appears now to be a definitive link
between the fire..</i>

45:46.422 --> 45:49.339
<i>And this morning's bank robbery
in Tres Cruces.</i>

45:49.550 --> 45:52.171
<i>A car, apparently used by
the bandits and  their getaway..</i>

45:52.386 --> 45:54.094
<i>Remained at the scene of the fire.</i>

45:54.304 --> 45:55.964
<i>Inside the car, on the front seat..</i>

45:56.245 --> 45:58.529
<i>Authorities found a body,
believed to be the remains</i>

45:58.554 --> 46:00.749
<i>of a woman who was
driving the getaway car.</i>

46:01.145 --> 46:03.137
<i>Earlier today, our man at
the Tres Cruces bank..</i>

46:03.355 --> 46:05.348
<i>Spoke to sheriff Bill Horton.</i>

46:05.700 --> 46:07.563
<i>Well uh.. this here..</i>

46:07.588 --> 46:13.177
<i>this here uh... body that we found is too
badly burnt for any kind of identification.</i>

46:13.365 --> 46:14.646
<i>Except for the teeth.</i>

46:15.409 --> 46:19.491
<i>So we've circularized every dentist in the
State with a description of the dental work.</i>

46:19.872 --> 46:22.991
<i>And of course we're... we
got every bus station</i>

46:23.208 --> 46:25.616
<i>and uh... railroad depot
and airport covered.</i>

46:25.836 --> 46:27.793
<i>All the roads and
highways are blocked.</i>

46:28.547 --> 46:32.627
<i>These people are not gonna make it
out of New Mexico... Not alive.</i>

46:33.135 --> 46:34.333
<i>That I promise you.</i>

46:43.187 --> 46:44.467
You know, Charley...

46:45.773 --> 46:47.315
You're just plain lucky!

46:47.524 --> 46:48.524
How do you figure?

46:48.567 --> 46:50.109
Because you're valuable.

46:50.861 --> 46:52.688
You know how to fly an airplane.

46:52.905 --> 46:55.084
And we're gonna get into
that airplane of yours and

46:55.109 --> 46:57.526
we're gonna sail right over
them goddamn roadblocks.

46:57.826 --> 46:59.320
What do you think of that?

46:59.828 --> 47:02.521
Where are we gonna land?
They'll have every airport covered.

47:02.539 --> 47:03.539
In Mexico?

47:03.874 --> 47:06.668
Especially in Mexico.
They'll be at every landing field.

47:06.752 --> 47:09.159
We're not gonna land in any landing fields.

47:09.630 --> 47:10.525
You're gonna land us..

47:10.786 --> 47:14.006
In some little old place where they never
even thought of looking for an airplane.

47:14.760 --> 47:15.760
I don't know.

47:16.804 --> 47:18.132
What do you mean you don't know?

47:21.558 --> 47:24.595
Ain't you supposed to be some
kind of hot-dog stunt pilot?

47:24.812 --> 47:28.406
Yeah but it's been a long time since
I've done any fancy flying.

47:28.410 --> 47:29.610
You kinda loose your knack.

47:29.650 --> 47:31.773
Well you better find
it again in a hurry.

47:32.611 --> 47:36.823
'Cause if you can't do that, Jimmy Dick,
what use are you?

47:42.546 --> 47:45.815
Uh... we'll have to rig an
auxiliary gas tank on that.

47:45.840 --> 47:47.562
Give us some cruising range.

47:48.085 --> 47:49.579
Now you're cooking Charley!

47:49.795 --> 47:52.203
First thing I'll have to
do is get the charts.

47:52.798 --> 47:53.798
What charts?

47:53.882 --> 47:56.109
Nadine's dental charts.
The X-rays.

47:56.718 --> 47:58.626
It's the only way they
have identifying her.

47:59.054 --> 48:01.972
I'll have to get over to that
dentist's office and... get 'em.

48:03.976 --> 48:05.387
You got another jug around here?

48:05.936 --> 48:06.967
Yeah.

48:07.771 --> 48:10.558
There's one in the chest
of drawers in the bedroom.

48:16.363 --> 48:17.292
Don't leave the trailer.

48:17.550 --> 48:18.445
"Don't leave the trailer."

48:19.116 --> 48:21.358
"Don't leave the trailer, Harman"

48:22.953 --> 48:25.029
Charley, you worry too much!

48:25.581 --> 48:27.454
No such thing as worrying to much..

48:27.666 --> 48:31.580
Not when you got the fuzz and the
Mafia after you at the same time.

48:31.795 --> 48:36.291
How long you reckon is gonna be
before they stop looking for us?

48:36.550 --> 48:38.507
The fuzz will quit pretty soon.

48:38.719 --> 48:41.922
The others never stop.
Not unless they think you're dead.

49:28.644 --> 49:33.079

If you got a bell honey,
we'll find a way to ring it.

51:59.795 --> 52:03.294
I didn't travel 600 miles for
the amusement of morons.

52:04.424 --> 52:05.919
Is that clear ladies?

52:06.176 --> 52:07.635
Now, just a darn minute there.

52:07.845 --> 52:11.545
You just keep throwing your feathers

52:27.156 --> 52:30.571
I'm Beverly.
Anything you want, name it.

52:31.160 --> 52:32.322
A good bed.

52:32.878 --> 52:35.037
Right, I've reserved
some bedding for you.

52:35.873 --> 52:37.782
Alright girls,
you can sit down now.

52:38.750 --> 52:39.865
Follow me, please.

52:50.012 --> 52:52.847
This is where my girls relax
when they're not working.

52:53.056 --> 52:57.303
They write letters, watch television
or play cards.

52:58.020 --> 53:00.807
Mr. Conforte,
I'll see you in just a few minutes.

53:01.023 --> 53:02.850
Ok honey. Take good care of this man.

53:03.108 --> 53:04.389
Oh yes, we will.

53:04.610 --> 53:05.772
This way, please.

53:16.872 --> 53:19.030
There's no charge for anything of course.

53:36.066 --> 53:39.649
- No waterbeds?
- Oh, I'm sorry. We have everything else.

53:40.354 --> 53:41.634
When I wake..

53:42.356 --> 53:45.310
I appreciate two three-and-a-half minute eggs

53:45.943 --> 53:49.798
a piece of dry whole wheat toast,
and a pot of hot herb tea.

53:51.240 --> 53:53.149
If there's anything we can
do for your pleasure?

53:54.326 --> 53:55.737
Jana is a nice girl.

53:58.789 --> 54:01.458
I don't sleep with whores.
That's not knowingly.

54:02.557 --> 54:04.957
Well... like they say

54:05.002 --> 54:07.058
"Different strokes for
different folks"

54:07.965 --> 54:08.965
Come on, Jana.

55:04.646 --> 55:06.105
Hey, mama?

55:08.274 --> 55:10.397
Have you seen Charley Varrick?

55:12.988 --> 55:18.029
I've been reading your newspaper about
that awful robbery.

55:18.519 --> 55:20.417
Have you seen Charley Varrick?

55:20.578 --> 55:23.033
Well, he left early, in the truck.

55:23.103 --> 55:24.683
Looking for that wife
of his, if you ask me.

55:25.667 --> 55:26.667
Shit!

55:38.128 --> 55:38.950
Varrick?!

55:38.975 --> 55:41.239
I'm over here in Reese.
Trying to run down a fitting.

55:41.257 --> 55:41.936
<i>Fitting?</i>

55:42.161 --> 55:44.817
Yeah, for the auxiliary gas tank
we talked about it last night.

55:44.833 --> 55:45.692
Don't you remember?

55:45.918 --> 55:49.273
Well anyway, I understand there's a guy over in
Shoemaker's who got one, I'm going over there.

55:49.297 --> 55:50.282
How's your tooth?

55:50.283 --> 55:53.437
The hell with my tooth. Where's the
goddamn money Charley? I can't find it.

55:53.505 --> 55:55.150
Don't worry. It's in a safe place.

55:55.158 --> 55:58.105
I couldn't leave it there with you
cocked <i>out, dead to the world? Could I?</i>

55:58.133 --> 55:59.085
<i>Have you seen the papers?</i>

55:59.145 --> 56:00.645
Yeah, got a copy right here.

56:00.777 --> 56:02.904
This picture of Al bothers me.

56:02.904 --> 56:05.442
It's not that good but somebody
might just pick up on it.

56:06.158 --> 56:08.399
You better stay there,
in case I need you fast.

56:08.818 --> 56:10.194
<i>I can't go very far.</i>

56:10.873 --> 56:12.840
<i>You gonna tell me what
you did with the money?</i>

56:13.447 --> 56:14.847
Not over the phone.

56:14.900 --> 56:16.393
Listen I got a million
things to do.

56:16.393 --> 56:19.263
There's another pint in the cupboard.
Stay put and I'll see you tonight.

56:19.721 --> 56:20.819
You better man!

56:51.970 --> 56:53.370
Hi, are you Tom?

56:53.515 --> 56:54.515
Yeah.

56:54.664 --> 56:57.352
Oh I mentioned to Al Dutcher
that I might need a

56:57.377 --> 57:00.064
special kind of a
favor someday and...

57:00.370 --> 57:03.292
He uh... he said you had connections.

57:04.624 --> 57:06.153
Al Dutcher?

57:07.695 --> 57:10.747
Ahh... small, thin, kinda nice little bird?

57:10.799 --> 57:13.455
No. Tall, husky, ugly looking bird.

57:14.059 --> 57:15.059
What do you want?

57:15.769 --> 57:16.967
I need some paper, quick.

57:18.397 --> 57:21.847
I don't sell paper. I make
my living selling guns.

57:21.900 --> 57:24.525
I need two passports. Al said
if you didn't handle something..

57:24.525 --> 57:26.139
you'd know somebody who did.

57:26.277 --> 57:28.877
Dutcher... Dutcher...

57:29.449 --> 57:32.240
And where am I supposed
to know this guy from?

57:32.300 --> 57:35.248
From Joliet, he was doing a
10 years slide for murder too.

57:35.473 --> 57:37.862
His girlfriend, Armenian girl.

57:50.887 --> 57:52.927
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

57:57.060 --> 57:58.060
Five bills.

57:58.061 --> 58:00.117
Five bills? Isn't that a little high?

58:00.349 --> 58:03.464
This one's six. Want bargain?
Buy yourself a rug.

58:03.464 --> 58:04.242
Ok, Ok.

58:08.384 --> 58:09.684
- $600
- Right.

58:10.973 --> 58:13.873
Two, three, four, five...

58:13.952 --> 58:15.233
600.

58:15.254 --> 58:16.664
Yeah, even money.

58:28.137 --> 58:30.037
There is the little beauty.

58:32.879 --> 58:34.042
"190.."

58:35.200 --> 58:37.400
- How you say that... Ara...?
- Arapahoe.

58:37.400 --> 58:38.845
- "Arapahoe Street".
- Yeah.

58:38.877 --> 58:42.201
- About a half mile down, turn to the right.
- Thank you very much.

58:44.264 --> 58:45.264
Oh, uh...

58:45.634 --> 58:46.749
Anything else?

58:48.762 --> 58:50.737
There might be something else.

58:52.190 --> 58:53.729
What if I wanna fence
off some money?

58:54.826 --> 58:56.800
- Hot?
- Burning up.

58:56.853 --> 58:58.748
Consecutive serial numbers?

58:58.805 --> 59:00.378
No, nothing like that but uh...

59:00.378 --> 59:03.194
 I wouldn't be surprised if
there was some sort of a record.

59:04.152 --> 59:06.012
How much money are we talking about?

59:06.229 --> 59:08.515
- A lot.
- A whole lot?

59:08.774 --> 59:09.973
A whole lot

59:10.909 --> 59:12.987
Where can I get in touch with you?

59:14.079 --> 59:16.976
I'll be here and there. Maybe I'd better
get in touch with you.

59:31.219 --> 59:32.219
Yeah?!

59:32.255 --> 59:33.833
<i>There's a phone call for you!</i>

59:49.105 --> 59:50.813
Are you ready for breakfast?

59:51.483 --> 59:55.138
- I don't know yet. I'll tell you later.
- Ok.

59:56.363 --> 59:59.918
- Shut the door on the way out.
- Right-O

01:00:05.215 --> 01:00:07.828
- Yeah?
- Hello Molly? Honest John here.

01:00:08.083 --> 01:00:11.037
We've got a lead for you, in Albuquerque.

01:00:11.253 --> 01:00:14.504
Tom's Gun shop.
He's expecting you.

01:00:14.673 --> 01:00:16.167
Yeah. Tom's Gun shop, right.

01:00:16.424 --> 01:00:20.574
Incidentally Maynard Boyle flew over
the New Mexico this morning.

01:00:20.595 --> 01:00:23.547
He's staying at the Travel-On-Inn motel.

01:00:24.307 --> 01:00:26.714
In Kendrick. Make a note of that.

01:00:40.824 --> 01:00:42.401
May I help you, Sir?

01:00:42.909 --> 01:00:46.409
My name is Maynard Boyle.
I'm President of Western Fidelity.

01:00:47.914 --> 01:00:50.488
This is our bank.
I'm here to see Harold Young.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:52.577
He's our branch manager.

01:00:52.794 --> 01:00:55.285
I'll tell Mr. Garfinkle
you're here Mr. Boyle.

01:00:55.656 --> 01:00:56.805
- Excuse me.
- No, just a minute.

01:00:57.156 --> 01:01:00.356
It's Young. Harold Young. He's the
one I wanna see. Not Garfinkle.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:04.100
Sir, the District Attorney's office
in in charge of this investigation.

01:01:04.306 --> 01:01:06.713
You'll need Mr. Garfinkle's
permission to see him.

01:01:06.933 --> 01:01:08.475
Now, excuse me please.

01:01:13.899 --> 01:01:18.257
- Mister, would you please push me?
- Sure.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.200
- What's your name?
- Holly. <i>- Sir?</i>

01:01:25.249 --> 01:01:26.771
- What's your kitty's name?
- Sam. <i>- Mr. Boyle.</i>

01:01:27.871 --> 01:01:29.116
This is Mr. Garfinkle.

01:01:29.331 --> 01:01:31.607
- You got any brothers and sisters?
- Yes.

01:01:31.607 --> 01:01:33.924
- How many?
- One brother and one sister.

01:01:34.753 --> 01:01:36.710
What's your business inside, Mr. Boyle?

01:01:37.255 --> 01:01:39.212
My business is I wanna see Harold Young.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.259
Afraid that's impossible right now.

01:01:42.469 --> 01:01:44.545
Why is it impossible? Is he under arrest?

01:01:44.763 --> 01:01:45.842
No, he's not under arrest.

01:01:46.056 --> 01:01:47.883
In that case I'd like to see him.

01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:50.847
I've flown all the way from Reno.
Especially for that purpose.

01:01:50.852 --> 01:01:53.516
Mr. Young is making an audit.
I'm sure you'll understand.

01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:56.162
Well, I assure you I do not understand.

01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:58.865
An why am I being denied
access to my own premises?

01:01:59.027 --> 01:02:00.852
Well, it's a matter of priority.

01:02:00.862 --> 01:02:03.553
You see, first and foremost this is
a murder investigation.

01:02:03.573 --> 01:02:05.649
Well, my business is purely financial.

01:02:06.117 --> 01:02:08.484
Oh, you're very lucky so far Mr. Boyle.

01:02:08.509 --> 01:02:11.349
All you've found missing is about $1300.

01:02:11.998 --> 01:02:16.826
Well, if you're a nice fellow
nice things happen to you.

01:02:17.045 --> 01:02:18.243
So I hear.

01:02:19.506 --> 01:02:21.333
Now, where can you be reached?

01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:25.168
I'm at a motel, in Kendrick.
The Travel-On-Inn.

01:02:25.637 --> 01:02:28.258
I'll have Mr. Young get in touch with you
as soon as he's free.

01:02:29.933 --> 01:02:31.133
Mr. Finkle?

01:02:34.228 --> 01:02:35.528
Garfinkle!

01:02:38.683 --> 01:02:40.759
Is Harold Young under suspicion?

01:02:40.877 --> 01:02:41.877
Suspicion of what?

01:02:42.087 --> 01:02:45.538
Suspicion of collusion in robbery.
Please don't talk down to me.

01:02:48.151 --> 01:02:50.144
Anybody could be under suspicion Mr. Boyle.

01:02:50.361 --> 01:02:52.983
You see, we're still at the stage where
questions have been raised.

01:02:53.782 --> 01:02:55.062
Now if you'll excuse me.

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:01.800
- Bye Holly.
- Good bye Mister.

01:03:48.044 --> 01:03:48.626
- Yeah?

01:03:48.626 --> 01:03:49.719
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:50.797 --> 01:03:53.624
- Are you the photographer?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.340
A man in a wheelchair gave me this.

01:03:58.930 --> 01:03:59.930
Come in.

01:04:07.105 --> 01:04:08.516
Will you just step right in there?

01:04:10.191 --> 01:04:11.472
What is it that you wanted?

01:04:11.693 --> 01:04:13.317
I need two passports in a hurry.

01:04:13.528 --> 01:04:15.210
Yeah everybody is in a hurry.

01:04:15.235 --> 01:04:16.590
- Got any pictures?
- No.

01:04:16.865 --> 01:04:20.948
No? Ok, over there.
Sit down on that stool if you will.

01:04:21.995 --> 01:04:24.201
What it'll cost ya will be 250 a piece.

01:04:24.414 --> 01:04:26.293
That's 500 all told.

01:04:27.085 --> 01:04:28.397
That's in advance.

01:04:29.252 --> 01:04:33.546
No offense but people who needs passports
in a hurry are generally in trouble.

01:04:33.757 --> 01:04:36.919
You get shot between now and then,
I get stuck. You understand?

01:04:36.977 --> 01:04:39.598
Yeah it's ok. I wouldn't want you
to take a loss.

01:04:43.725 --> 01:04:45.100
How soon can we you 'em?

01:04:45.277 --> 01:04:46.835
Uh... You say you need two of 'em?

01:04:46.945 --> 01:04:48.923
Yes one for me and
one for my friend.

01:04:48.938 --> 01:04:52.060
- I can let you have 'em in two days.
- Two days?

01:04:52.208 --> 01:04:54.065
It's not a rush order
that'll cost you a lil' extra.

01:04:54.277 --> 01:04:56.353
You'll have to do better than that.

01:04:58.156 --> 01:04:59.879
What, are you kidding?
You know what's involved?

01:04:59.879 --> 01:05:02.032
This is not digging
potatoes, you know?

01:05:03.953 --> 01:05:05.911
How soon can your friend be in
to have his picture taken?

01:05:06.122 --> 01:05:08.792
He can't, I was hoping maybe
you could use this.

01:05:09.042 --> 01:05:10.080
Is that that way you wanna look?

01:05:13.046 --> 01:05:14.754
That's his driver's license.

01:05:17.133 --> 01:05:18.925
Harman Sullivan, that's
the name you wanna use?

01:05:19.135 --> 01:05:21.128
- Yeah, can you use that picture?
- Sure I can do..

01:05:21.346 --> 01:05:23.614
But have you any idea what
kind of work is involved?

01:05:24.176 --> 01:05:26.500
 I'm gonna have to work
day and night. <i>Pose.</i>

01:05:26.851 --> 01:05:30.600
- And that's gonna cost you 500 extra.
- $500?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.087
$500.

01:05:34.025 --> 01:05:35.982
What do you get for a glass of water?

01:05:37.028 --> 01:05:39.602
I tell you what, I'll give you the other 500.

01:05:40.031 --> 01:05:44.243
But I gotta have both passports
by six o'clock tonight.

01:05:44.911 --> 01:05:46.322
Tomorrow. The absolute outside.

01:05:46.621 --> 01:05:48.578
Split the difference. Twelve, midnight.

01:05:51.584 --> 01:05:53.826
Things I do for a handsome man.

01:05:54.005 --> 01:05:57.126
- Well, thanks very much.
- Thank you very much!

01:05:57.382 --> 01:06:00.214
Alright, here's the
information you'll need...

01:06:00.571 --> 01:06:01.776
for the passports.

01:06:01.845 --> 01:06:03.387
You got the names and the..

01:06:05.181 --> 01:06:07.304
Hair, eyes, height... that stuff.

01:06:07.517 --> 01:06:10.055
Charley Varrick: Reese River mobile homes.
That's my address.

01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:12.472
My telephone number is right down here.

01:06:13.273 --> 01:06:15.349
Here's my card, in case you loose that.

01:06:16.067 --> 01:06:17.067
See you at midnight.

01:06:19.779 --> 01:06:21.986
Uh Mr. Varrick. You sure this money is good?

01:06:22.198 --> 01:06:24.820
People kill each other
for that kind of money.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:28.935
- Can I use one of your suckers?
- It'll cost you and extra 500.

01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:32.617
Close the outside door on your way out, ok?

01:06:32.834 --> 01:06:33.834
You got it.

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:35.455
I got it.

01:06:58.610 --> 01:06:59.689
I'm Molly.

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:06.992
Well... what I have for you
is special information.

01:07:07.619 --> 01:07:10.904
Cost me a lot of money.
I gotta get something for it.

01:07:11.414 --> 01:07:13.786
Well, you're going to earn
a great deal of good will.

01:07:14.918 --> 01:07:17.325
I got all the good will I need.

01:07:20.381 --> 01:07:24.593
If you wanna know what I know
get some cash on the counter.

01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:36.761
Now sit there and start talking.

01:07:37.065 --> 01:07:38.559
With good will.

01:08:03.007 --> 01:08:07.219
I don't suppose that I could get a bug
in my motel room or your car this fast.

01:08:08.638 --> 01:08:10.429
But it never hurts to be careful.

01:08:11.724 --> 01:08:13.717
They'd have to get a court order first.

01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:15.467
A court order?

01:08:16.145 --> 01:08:18.019
To install a listening device.

01:08:18.031 --> 01:08:20.715
Oh I'm not talking about
that bright little bagel

01:08:20.715 --> 01:08:22.866
snapper from the District
Attorney's office.

01:08:24.118 --> 01:08:26.312
- What does he call himself?
- Garfinkle.

01:08:26.487 --> 01:08:28.160
Garfinkle.

01:08:28.316 --> 01:08:30.024
He should change his name.

01:08:33.154 --> 01:08:34.648
You know something, Harold?

01:08:34.947 --> 01:08:38.388
I never thought I 'd be willing
to change places with a cow.

01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:39.872
A cow?

01:08:40.078 --> 01:08:43.529
Those things out there.
They are cows, aren't they?

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:46.741
I don't understand the
thrust of your comment.

01:08:47.752 --> 01:08:51.200
Take a look at them out there.
I mean, they got it knocked.

01:08:51.589 --> 01:08:55.337
And what's... what's the worst thing in the
world that could possibly happen to them?

01:08:56.511 --> 01:08:59.428
A short circuit in the electric milker.

01:09:03.475 --> 01:09:05.515
Compared to what I'm facing..

01:09:06.688 --> 01:09:08.229
that's child's play.

01:09:10.066 --> 01:09:12.901
Are you talking about the Las Vegas people?

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:17.520
I'm in trouble Harold.
And it's my own damn fault.

01:09:18.825 --> 01:09:22.490
They're gonna ask me why did I pick
this particular bank.

01:09:23.662 --> 01:09:27.078
And believe me, from where I'm sitting,
it looks damn peculiar.

01:09:27.417 --> 01:09:29.243
Surely they don't suspect you.

01:09:30.837 --> 01:09:32.545
I'm on the list Harold.

01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:34.880
And it's a very short list.

01:09:36.466 --> 01:09:40.546
You and I are the only ones who knew
the money was gonna be in the bank.

01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:43.840
Then they suspect me too?

01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:49.185
Good God man, now you don't think I had
anything to do with it?

01:09:49.814 --> 01:09:51.142
Of course not.

01:09:51.524 --> 01:09:55.771
I'm not an ambitious man.
I don't need very much.

01:09:55.987 --> 01:09:58.145
I've been very happy here in Tres Cruces.

01:09:58.364 --> 01:10:00.321
I've become a part of the community.

01:10:00.533 --> 01:10:05.149
And people appreciate not just the
day-to-day business of banking but..

01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:06.868
The way I've restored the bank.

01:10:07.081 --> 01:10:11.542
I've made it a part of the living
historical heritage of the community.

01:10:12.503 --> 01:10:16.287
For the first time in my life
I found a place that I love.

01:10:16.507 --> 01:10:18.915
Why would I jeopardize that?

01:10:19.719 --> 01:10:21.046
I believe you Harold.

01:10:21.522 --> 01:10:24.190
I only hope they do
when the time comes.

01:10:26.309 --> 01:10:28.432
We might as well face it,
they're gonna ask questions.

01:10:29.729 --> 01:10:33.228
For instance we've been keeping various sums
of money at the bank from time to time.

01:10:33.691 --> 01:10:35.435
But the one time we're really load up..

01:10:35.651 --> 01:10:39.317
<i>Bang!</i>, this little horseshit bank a million miles
from nowhere gets hit by four professionals.

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:40.975
Now they're gonna think that's strange.

01:10:41.115 --> 01:10:44.449
It's a coincidence. That's all. Just a
coincidence. They do happen, you know.

01:10:44.533 --> 01:10:45.533
Yeah.

01:10:46.954 --> 01:10:51.375
But they're gonna think it's odd that
you made no effort to get the police.

01:10:51.876 --> 01:10:54.794
That you just trodded right over...
Open the vault.

01:10:55.546 --> 01:10:58.290
- There really wasn't anything else I could do.
- Oh no.

01:10:58.966 --> 01:11:00.425
You could have fainted!

01:11:01.594 --> 01:11:04.595
I had a gun at my head!
Don't you understand?

01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:07.930
I understand perfectly.

01:11:08.142 --> 01:11:11.725
I am not a physically
courageous man, Maynard.

01:11:12.063 --> 01:11:15.230
It's our Mafia friends
that won't understand.

01:11:15.525 --> 01:11:17.904
They're gonna... they're
gonna wonder why...

01:11:17.904 --> 01:11:21.053
you led them directly to the
vault with the money in it...

01:11:21.239 --> 01:11:23.611
Instead of the empty vault on the rear.

01:11:24.701 --> 01:11:28.070
And frankly Harold...
Why did you do that?

01:11:28.788 --> 01:11:33.201
Do you know what would have happened if I
had taken those people to an empty vault?

01:11:33.418 --> 01:11:35.273
Number one: The money
would have been save.

01:11:35.273 --> 01:11:38.068
Number two: There'd be no
question of an inside job.

01:11:38.257 --> 01:11:41.077
- Inside Job?
- That's the way their diseased minds work.

01:11:41.393 --> 01:11:44.882
A bank gets hit? <i>Bang!</i> They
look for a double-cross.

01:11:45.179 --> 01:11:47.053
Why couldn't it be just a coincidence?

01:11:47.265 --> 01:11:49.756
Because they don't believe in coincidence.

01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:03.193
I don't know what to do.

01:12:11.914 --> 01:12:14.156
Take a look at the big brown one out there.

01:12:15.226 --> 01:12:16.826
Man! What a set of jugs.

01:12:20.631 --> 01:12:22.458
You need a rest Harold.

01:12:23.509 --> 01:12:26.047
A long trip, to some place quiet.

01:12:27.597 --> 01:12:30.467
Another name.
Another country.

01:12:32.393 --> 01:12:35.063
I can't start my life over again now.

01:12:35.271 --> 01:12:37.727
You don't have much choice, Harold.

01:12:38.816 --> 01:12:41.307
They're gonna try to make you
tell where the money is.

01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:45.439
You know what kind of people they are.

01:12:47.241 --> 01:12:51.405
They will strip you naked and go to work on
you with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.

01:12:54.916 --> 01:12:57.870
If you need money Harold, I can help.

01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:00.810
That's what I call a hell of a lock.

01:14:02.692 --> 01:14:03.692
I'm Molly.

01:14:04.569 --> 01:14:07.273
Yeah, I didn't figure you for
Clint Eastwood.

01:14:09.824 --> 01:14:10.939
Which one is this?

01:14:11.159 --> 01:14:12.534
Charley Varrick.

01:14:14.996 --> 01:14:17.202
That's the other one.
Harman Sullivan.

01:14:17.415 --> 01:14:18.415
Don't keep that.

01:14:18.499 --> 01:14:20.990
It's the only picture
Varrick gave me of him.

01:14:25.106 --> 01:14:27.963
- When will he be coming by to pick these up?
- Midnight.

01:14:28.509 --> 01:14:29.920
Oh much obliged.

01:14:31.137 --> 01:14:32.250
And by the way...

01:14:32.661 --> 01:14:35.787
 Did the gentleman say where he might
be reached in case something came up?

01:14:36.267 --> 01:14:37.642
Yeah, he gave me that.

01:14:40.396 --> 01:14:43.900
"Reese River mobile homes."
"Charley Varrick..

01:14:44.901 --> 01:14:46.692
...last of the independents."

01:14:48.029 --> 01:14:51.528
I like that. Has a ring of finality.

01:15:47.586 --> 01:15:49.586
He's not in there!

01:15:52.424 --> 01:15:54.630
Are you looking for his wife?

01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:57.679
Uh, no, I'm here on business.

01:15:58.063 --> 01:16:01.017
Maybe Mr. Sullivan can help you.

01:16:01.075 --> 01:16:02.781
He's in there.

01:16:03.072 --> 01:16:04.096
Oh, thank you Ma'am.

01:16:29.336 --> 01:16:30.415
What do you want?

01:16:31.672 --> 01:16:33.603
I need some crops dusted.

01:16:34.236 --> 01:16:35.863
Looking for Charles Varrick.

01:16:36.843 --> 01:16:38.254
He ain't here!

01:16:39.179 --> 01:16:41.504
Oh Gosh. I won't be able
to come back tomorrow.

01:16:41.848 --> 01:16:45.348
I was wondering if I might... leave
my card with you. I'd appreciate it.

01:16:53.193 --> 01:16:57.025
I can't seem to be able to find one,
it's so dark out here.

01:17:00.659 --> 01:17:02.676
Say, would you mind if I
came inside just a second?

01:17:02.676 --> 01:17:04.352
I'll just scribble where he can reach me.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.335
Sure sorry I disturbed you.

01:17:23.432 --> 01:17:25.305
I take it you're Mr. Sullivan, huh?

01:17:25.656 --> 01:17:28.779
- Mr. Harman Sullivan?
- Yeah, yeah. That's right.

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.412
Sooner or later you're gonna
tell me everything you know.

01:18:00.594 --> 01:18:03.595
So why not save yourself a great
deal of pain, tell me now.

01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:07.309
Harman.

01:18:07.316 --> 01:18:08.257
Where's the money?

01:18:08.571 --> 01:18:12.002
Jesus guy, you... busted my ribs.

01:18:14.983 --> 01:18:18.599
Let's try this way.
Where's Charles Varrick?

01:18:18.654 --> 01:18:19.954
I don't know.

01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:23.303
He left you to take the heat?
Is that it?

01:18:23.742 --> 01:18:27.325
That's... that's what he did.
Exactly what he did.

01:18:27.537 --> 01:18:28.537
Dirty bastard!

01:18:29.873 --> 01:18:31.665
There's one thing that puzzles me..

01:18:32.584 --> 01:18:36.249
If he's gonna leave you behind,
why have a passport made for you?

01:18:39.007 --> 01:18:41.878
Oh you didn't give Varrick
your driver license?

01:18:43.053 --> 01:18:47.254
My wallet, is right there in my shirt.
Can I show you?

01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:49.041
Sure.

01:19:13.333 --> 01:19:14.333
It's gone!

01:19:14.585 --> 01:19:16.411
Surprise, surprise...

01:19:20.591 --> 01:19:24.125
Don't insult my intelligence boy!
That could be a grave error.

01:19:24.803 --> 01:19:28.386
I swear to God. I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:19:30.392 --> 01:19:33.678
I'm asking you nicely.
Where is the money?

01:19:35.606 --> 01:19:37.530
Charley's got it.

01:19:38.516 --> 01:19:40.624
God, he was so scared because
I wanted to give it back.

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:43.500
- You want to give the money back?
- Yeah. <i>- Why?</i>

01:19:44.156 --> 01:19:46.881
Why did you want to give
the money back Harman?

01:19:47.492 --> 01:19:48.492
Because..

01:19:49.911 --> 01:19:54.500
'Cause it's... it's Mafia money. That's why.

01:19:55.334 --> 01:19:56.334
How did you know that?

01:19:56.585 --> 01:19:59.455
- Charley told me.
- And who told Charley?

01:20:00.339 --> 01:20:01.714
Who fingered the job?

01:20:02.507 --> 01:20:03.705
Was it Young?

01:20:07.721 --> 01:20:08.721
I don't know.

01:20:10.641 --> 01:20:13.201
Young doesn't have the balls
for a deal like that.

01:20:14.097 --> 01:20:15.250
 It was Boyle, wasn't it?

01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:17.559
I wish I did know... man.

01:20:20.442 --> 01:20:23.063
My patience is wearing thin.

01:20:23.403 --> 01:20:26.108
If I don't get some
satisfaction from you soon..

01:20:26.573 --> 01:20:28.898
Gonna start hurting you very badly.

01:20:30.285 --> 01:20:32.776
- Where is Varrick?
- I don't know.

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:34.659
Where's the money?

01:20:38.543 --> 01:20:43.455
<i>Sonny boy</i>, now you and I are
just not communicating.

01:20:44.287 --> 01:20:45.687
- Evening Sheriff.
- Evening.

01:20:45.801 --> 01:20:47.758
Mr. Garfinkle has been expecting you.

01:20:49.471 --> 01:20:51.096
Run a check on these, will you Ned?

01:20:54.226 --> 01:20:55.226
Harold!

01:20:56.103 --> 01:20:57.103
You alright?

01:20:57.574 --> 01:20:59.374
Oh, first grade Bill, first grade.

01:21:00.315 --> 01:21:04.016
Just that I don't like strangers
in my bank when I'm not here.

01:21:08.198 --> 01:21:10.107
Would you mind closing the door?

01:21:18.375 --> 01:21:19.703
How are things progressing Bill?

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.537
Well.. I've been thinking...

01:21:22.004 --> 01:21:24.673
- Two of 'em drive up in the Connie, right?
- Right.

01:21:24.881 --> 01:21:27.925
But there's two already
inside the bank waiting.

01:21:27.925 --> 01:21:29.417
Now how'd they get here?

01:21:30.554 --> 01:21:33.160
You think maybe there's an abandoned
vehicle someplace...

01:21:41.106 --> 01:21:44.769
Sheriff Horton. They said the car has been
there ever since the morning of the robbery.

01:21:44.769 --> 01:21:45.692
Right.

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.457
- What is it?
- For what it's worth, matches.

01:21:50.991 --> 01:21:52.189
"Reese Lanes".

01:21:52.618 --> 01:21:55.618
Well, hell. That's it! This
case is breaking wide open.

01:21:55.829 --> 01:21:59.412
Get a line on that bastard even if I have to
ring every doorbell in Reese. Come on Dan.

01:22:00.459 --> 01:22:03.843
Dan, you and Henderson stay in the car
and let me know if you find anything.

01:22:03.854 --> 01:22:05.680
Everybody else, let's move it!

01:23:28.714 --> 01:23:30.457
You called it, kid.

01:23:53.822 --> 01:23:54.858
Who's there?

01:23:55.785 --> 01:23:56.725
Molly.

01:23:58.994 --> 01:24:00.868
Told you I wouldn't be
finished 'til midnight!

01:24:01.079 --> 01:24:03.321
So <i>boo-hoo</i>, we'll kill an hour too.

01:24:08.462 --> 01:24:10.086
You haven't heard from Mr. Varrick?

01:24:10.297 --> 01:24:11.874
No, not yet.

01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:21.719
May I use your telephone?

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:23.725
Yeah, make yourself at home.

01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:30.522
Say, you wouldn't have a beer for
a thirsty man, would you?

01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:32.890
I'll look and see.

01:24:36.281 --> 01:24:37.526
Beverly, it's Molly.

01:24:37.741 --> 01:24:41.359
I'm in Albuquerque at 242-5325.

01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:30.770
Varrick!

01:26:32.564 --> 01:26:34.521
I got a warrant for your arrest.

01:26:35.275 --> 01:26:37.985
Either you come out or we're coming in.

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.692
Alright everybody. Do stand
fast and keep us covered.

01:26:46.453 --> 01:26:48.576
And don't anybody get careless.

01:27:13.105 --> 01:27:15.856
I could have told you nobody was home.

01:27:18.902 --> 01:27:20.902
Will you sign for the dynamite please?

01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:23.190
- Sign for the dynamite, right?
- Right.

01:27:23.448 --> 01:27:26.319
- Gotta sign for everything these days.
- I guess so.

01:27:26.535 --> 01:27:28.990
Dynamite, time delay cap...

01:27:29.204 --> 01:27:32.345
Mercury switch and emergency
compartment light.

01:27:32.346 --> 01:27:36.293
- One, two, three and four. Anything else?
- That's it.

01:27:36.294 --> 01:27:37.954
That's $9 even.

01:27:42.201 --> 01:27:43.797
There you go. Out of 10.

01:27:47.681 --> 01:27:49.804
Wouldn't happen to have the uh...
Time, eh?

01:27:50.225 --> 01:27:52.348
My watch's a little slow.
It's 8:47.

01:27:53.645 --> 01:27:56.419
- I'll put that in a bag?
- It's ok, don't need a bag. Thank you.

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.598
May I ask what that's for?

01:27:58.817 --> 01:28:00.062
Yes, you certainly may.

01:28:11.788 --> 01:28:13.781
No, no. I wanna talk to Mr. Boyle.

01:28:13.999 --> 01:28:15.244
What is it about please?

01:28:15.834 --> 01:28:18.498
This is the main office of
Western Fidelity banks, isn't it?

01:28:18.523 --> 01:28:19.710
Yes. Yes it is.

01:28:19.713 --> 01:28:22.038
And Mr. Boyle is the president of the chain?

01:28:22.299 --> 01:28:25.335
And I'm his executive secretary.
Now, how can I help you, please?

01:28:25.594 --> 01:28:29.089
You can't. I have to see or talk
with Mr. Boyle himself.

01:28:29.148 --> 01:28:32.161
Mr. Boyle is out of town but
I'm sure if you leave your

01:28:32.161 --> 01:28:33.516
name and a number where you
can be reached, he'll..

01:28:33.602 --> 01:28:35.179
What is your name, please?

01:28:36.313 --> 01:28:38.362
- Miss Fort.
- Fort?

01:28:38.387 --> 01:28:39.102
Yes, Sir.

01:30:49.237 --> 01:30:50.237
Hey kid!

01:30:50.977 --> 01:30:51.977
<i>Hey kid!</i>

01:30:52.783 --> 01:30:54.407
Bring all your roses.

01:30:54.993 --> 01:30:55.976
All of 'em?

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.510
<i>All of 'em!</i>

01:31:04.753 --> 01:31:06.828
- Atta boy. 20 Ok?
- Sure.

01:31:07.016 --> 01:31:09.316
- Ok, thank you
- Thank you

01:31:28.803 --> 01:31:31.073
Oh Miss Fort. Good evening.

01:31:31.246 --> 01:31:34.552
A gentleman brought some flowers by for you
earlier. I thought you might like to have them.

01:31:34.991 --> 01:31:35.656
Who did?

01:31:35.867 --> 01:31:39.651
I really don't know. He didn't leave his
name. I thought probably you would know him.

01:32:50.579 --> 01:32:52.000
- Good evening Miss Fort.
- Hi.

01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:55.478
- Good evening. How are you tonight, William?
- Fine.

01:34:14.025 --> 01:34:15.025
Who is it?

01:34:15.193 --> 01:34:16.438
Flowers.

01:34:28.039 --> 01:34:29.039
What do you want?

01:34:29.207 --> 01:34:31.414
Oh I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

01:34:32.002 --> 01:34:35.038
Which doesn't mean I won't throw you
right out  that window if I have to.

01:34:36.047 --> 01:34:37.162
I'm not scared.

01:34:37.924 --> 01:34:39.502
- What do you want?
- I wanna see Boyle.

01:34:49.853 --> 01:34:50.853
Kendrick bar.

01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:54.524
Hello. I'd like to speak to Mr.
Maynard Boyle, please.

01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:56.247
Is there a Mr. Boyle in the house?

01:34:57.194 --> 01:34:58.273
Be right there.

01:35:08.198 --> 01:35:11.990
- Hello. Hello?!
- Hello. This is Sybil.

01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:14.208
<i>How pleasant to hear your voice Miss Fort.</i>

01:35:14.461 --> 01:35:16.454
I assume this call is important.

01:35:16.671 --> 01:35:20.005
<i>If you consider three quarters
of a million dollars important.</i>

01:35:21.927 --> 01:35:22.958
What about it?

01:35:23.178 --> 01:35:26.547
<i>I have a gentleman here who
wants to give it back to you.</i>

01:35:28.308 --> 01:35:29.400
Is he alone?

01:35:29.468 --> 01:35:31.182
<i>Yes. He's alone.</i>

01:35:31.394 --> 01:35:32.394
Put him on.

01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:37.379
Thank you.

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:38.324
Hello Boyle.

01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:39.558
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.090
Charley Varrick.

01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:42.828
<i>I got something I wanna get back to you.</i>

01:35:44.116 --> 01:35:45.278
How is it packaged?

01:35:45.534 --> 01:35:48.618
In two canvas leather bags with
the name stenciled on the front.

01:35:49.454 --> 01:35:50.830
So give 'em back. What's the problem?

01:35:51.081 --> 01:35:54.400
The problem is the big gorilla in the
maroon car who's trying to kill me.

01:35:55.877 --> 01:35:56.877
I'm listening.

01:35:57.045 --> 01:35:59.438
All I want is your word that
once these bags are delivered

01:35:59.463 --> 01:36:01.571
to your hand, that's the end of it.
No reprisals.

01:36:02.092 --> 01:36:03.171
<i>Say you wanna meet with me?</i>

01:36:03.385 --> 01:36:04.713
Alone. No hitmen.

01:36:06.847 --> 01:36:07.847
Where?

01:36:07.848 --> 01:36:12.723
Ten miles north of Reese. On state highway number
23. There's a big automobile junkyard there..

01:36:12.978 --> 01:36:15.266
<i>And an airstrip that crop-dusters use.</i>

01:36:16.565 --> 01:36:20.313
10 miles north of Reese..
On state highway 23..

01:36:20.861 --> 01:36:24.526
I'll meet you there tomorrow morning and when I
fly in I wanna see you standing there alone.

01:36:25.031 --> 01:36:26.407
What time in the morning?

01:36:26.616 --> 01:36:28.027
<i>Just be there early.</i>

01:36:28.368 --> 01:36:31.322
About a quarter of a mile down
the strip past the hangar.

01:36:31.538 --> 01:36:34.705
And if there's anybody within
500 yards of you, forget it.

01:36:34.916 --> 01:36:36.826
Just kiss the money goodbye.
Got it?

01:36:37.252 --> 01:36:38.367
I'll see you in the morning.

01:36:47.888 --> 01:36:49.927
- Charley Varrick?
- Yeah.

01:36:51.183 --> 01:36:54.801
I'm gonna tell you something
I guess I shouldn't.

01:36:56.438 --> 01:36:58.561
I wouldn't trust him if I were you.

01:37:03.445 --> 01:37:05.153
I like your bed.

01:37:05.655 --> 01:37:09.190
You may find this hard to believe
but I've never slept on a round bed.

01:37:09.477 --> 01:37:10.375
Is that so?

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.092
What's the best way?
North, South, East or West?

01:37:13.288 --> 01:37:14.996
That depends on what you had in mind.

01:37:15.207 --> 01:37:17.448
What I had in mind was boxing the compass.

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.465
You'd better not be there.

01:37:25.801 --> 01:37:26.801
Why not?

01:37:30.055 --> 01:37:33.803
It there's anyone around... 500 yards..

01:37:35.769 --> 01:37:36.848
The deal is gone.

01:37:38.271 --> 01:37:40.311
So I'll be 501 yards.

01:37:40.982 --> 01:37:42.062
Just don't be there.

01:38:09.886 --> 01:38:10.886
That's nice.

01:38:11.721 --> 01:38:13.679
My wife's wedding ring.

01:38:16.226 --> 01:38:18.764
You're an interesting man Mr. Varrick.

01:38:19.563 --> 01:38:20.642
Go to sleep Miss Fort.

01:38:20.856 --> 01:38:22.895
The last of the independents!

01:38:23.108 --> 01:38:25.943
Go to sleep. You know I have to be up early.

01:38:26.486 --> 01:38:27.601
Don't get killed!

01:38:29.239 --> 01:38:31.908
I'll try not to. Go to sleep, please.

01:38:34.494 --> 01:38:37.780
You still owe me south by south-west.

01:38:38.457 --> 01:38:40.117
Then will you go to sleep?

01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:42.705
We'll see.

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.468
South by south-west.

01:38:57.434 --> 01:38:58.928
Think it's this way.

01:41:49.064 --> 01:41:50.606
You found it.
We did it!

01:41:50.816 --> 01:41:53.057
We pulled it off!

01:41:53.527 --> 01:41:54.565
What the hell are you talking about?

01:42:05.861 --> 01:42:07.161
We did it!

01:42:27.853 --> 01:42:29.400
What are you doing? What is this?

01:45:50.013 --> 01:45:51.756
Are you a hard man to reach?

01:45:54.684 --> 01:45:56.344
I'll make a deal with you.

01:45:56.728 --> 01:45:58.934
You're hardly in any position to make a deal.

01:46:00.941 --> 01:46:02.814
Smell that gasoline?

01:46:03.777 --> 01:46:05.424
I bet this thing will burn in a hurry.

01:46:05.633 --> 01:46:08.198
I know where the money is.
You'll never find it without my help.

01:46:10.283 --> 01:46:11.283
Your end is what?

01:46:11.409 --> 01:46:13.153
Just help me out of here and let me go.

01:46:19.459 --> 01:46:21.203
- Where's the money.
- We got a deal?

01:46:21.461 --> 01:46:22.461
Money first.

01:46:27.717 --> 01:46:31.217
Get the keys out of my pocket
I can't move my arm.

01:46:37.978 --> 01:46:40.813
- Now you see that blue Chevy over there?

01:46:43.358 --> 01:46:44.817
The money is in the trunk.

01:46:48.363 --> 01:46:49.526
Well, I'll be back.

01:46:50.305 --> 01:46:56.549
