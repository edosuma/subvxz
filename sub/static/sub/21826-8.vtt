WEBVTT

00:03.968 --> 00:05.273
Guys, I'm sorry.

00:05.298 --> 00:07.439
The phlebotomy room
is for drawing blood,

00:07.440 --> 00:09.025
not for recording your podcast.

00:09.026 --> 00:11.025
Now, before we leave, I have received

00:11.050 --> 00:13.760
a sternly worded missive from oncology

00:13.785 --> 00:16.375
demanding that we return
their popcorn maker.

00:18.671 --> 00:20.507
I don't think we have it anymore.

00:20.508 --> 00:22.218
Damn it, Mindy, we can't
have another department

00:22.219 --> 00:23.805
mad at us. Not after what happened

00:23.806 --> 00:25.600
with radiology's panini press.

00:25.601 --> 00:28.440
We put crayons in it
to see what would happen.

00:28.441 --> 00:30.986
What happened was a building evacuation.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.823
Fine, Jeremy. I'll return it.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.577
Thus removing the only thing
that I look forward to

00:34.578 --> 00:36.246
- the entire day.
- Wonderful.

00:36.247 --> 00:37.791
Well, if there are
no more announcements...

00:37.792 --> 00:39.628
- I have an announcement.
- Of course.

00:39.629 --> 00:41.507
So, you guys might all be wondering

00:41.508 --> 00:43.511
why I'm dressed in this
beautiful traditional garb.

00:43.512 --> 00:45.264
I've learned never to comment
on your appearance.

00:45.265 --> 00:46.851
Good or bad.
Lawyers made that very clear.

00:46.852 --> 00:48.521
Mm-hmm.

00:48.522 --> 00:50.107
So, out of respect
for my future husband,

00:50.108 --> 00:52.069
I am converting to Morgan's religion.

00:52.070 --> 00:54.450
Morgan's religion?
I'm Morgan's religion.

00:54.451 --> 00:56.454
No, he's Siberian Orthodox.

00:56.455 --> 00:58.123
It's a beautiful faith the
Russian people have been trying

00:58.124 --> 00:59.627
to genocide for centuries.

00:59.628 --> 01:01.505
Yeah, we will be getting married

01:01.506 --> 01:03.927
at St. Dracul's of the
Black Heart in Far Rockaway.

01:03.928 --> 01:05.764
- Wait, what?
- Whoa.

01:05.765 --> 01:07.183
I thought this was gonna be
a fun black wedding.

01:07.184 --> 01:09.187
Jumping the broom, hallelujer,

01:09.188 --> 01:11.149
maybe Lee Daniels is there and
gets drunk and tries to kiss me.

01:11.150 --> 01:12.402
- No.
- No, Lee Daniels...

01:12.403 --> 01:14.406
My uncle Arcadi will be there.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.994
And he has the longest beard
you've ever seen in your life.

01:16.995 --> 01:18.915
- Aww, man.
- So, out of respect

01:18.916 --> 01:20.794
for my new faith, I can no longer

01:20.795 --> 01:22.714
use electricity
on Wednesdays and Fridays,

01:22.715 --> 01:24.259
I have to pray 12 times a day,

01:24.260 --> 01:25.470
and I'm gonna be microwaving fish a lot.

01:27.057 --> 01:28.308
It does seem like that
might get in the way

01:28.309 --> 01:29.310
of your productivity at work.

01:29.311 --> 01:31.482
Hello? ACLU?

01:31.483 --> 01:33.570
Hey, happy conversion.

01:33.571 --> 01:34.738
- Yeah.
- Meeting adjourned.

01:37.745 --> 01:41.422
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx

01:41.534 --> 01:44.148
Oncology is so much nicer
than labor and delivery.

01:44.262 --> 01:45.848
Hey, I gotta talk
to you about something.

01:46.388 --> 01:48.181
So, now that Tamra's joining my church,

01:48.182 --> 01:49.393
I have to follow all their rules.

01:49.394 --> 01:51.497
Do you want me to circumcise you?

01:51.498 --> 01:53.209
I've been dying to try that.

01:53.234 --> 01:55.279
What if I gave you a little
popped collar down there?

01:55.280 --> 01:57.366
- And I was like snip, snip.
- I'm very circumcised, okay?

01:57.367 --> 02:00.080
Look, I can't be alone
in a room with a woman.

02:00.081 --> 02:01.584
Well, who's gonna pull up
my Spanx every morning

02:01.585 --> 02:03.379
and cut me out of them every night?

02:03.380 --> 02:05.049
Those were some of
the best moments of my life.

02:05.050 --> 02:06.886
- But they're over.
- Ugh.

02:06.887 --> 02:08.806
Well, if it isn't Priyanka Nope-ra.

02:08.806 --> 02:09.933
And Doggo Mortensen.

02:09.934 --> 02:12.606
Aww, that hurts, man.

02:12.607 --> 02:14.777
We are here to return
your popcorn machine.

02:14.778 --> 02:16.196
And we'd like to check it
back out again.

02:16.197 --> 02:17.866
You had it for 18 weeks.

02:17.867 --> 02:19.369
Is that your lipstick
on the butter spout?

02:19.370 --> 02:21.247
- We both know that it is.
- Okay.

02:21.248 --> 02:22.876
- Okay, bring it around.
- Say good-bye to the old girl.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.713
- Bye, Poppy.
- Let me say good-bye.

02:24.714 --> 02:26.007
No, not with your bare hands.

02:26.008 --> 02:29.056
Ugh, God.

02:31.395 --> 02:33.188
Annette?

02:33.189 --> 02:35.443
Annette, what are you doing here?

02:35.444 --> 02:38.365
You know that Danny doesn't
work in this hospital anymore.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.993
Oh, no. You have dementia.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.497
Annette, I am Mindy!

02:41.498 --> 02:43.250
Cut it out. I know who you are.

02:43.251 --> 02:45.672
I dropped your son off
at school this morning.

02:45.673 --> 02:47.091
And speaking of dementia,

02:47.092 --> 02:48.845
you forgot to put a shirt on him.

02:48.846 --> 02:50.932
It was a muscle tank.
Leo has amazing guns,

02:50.933 --> 02:52.936
and the world needs to see them.

02:52.937 --> 02:55.232
Wait, why are you
in the oncology department?

02:55.233 --> 02:57.863
Dr. Richlin's ready
to see you now, Ms. Castellano.

02:57.864 --> 02:59.365
Richlin?

02:59.366 --> 03:01.327
You're seeing a cancer specialist?

03:01.328 --> 03:04.626
None of your beeswax.
And don't tell anyone I'm here.

03:04.627 --> 03:06.087
Especially Danny.

03:06.088 --> 03:08.008
Come right this way, Annette.

03:08.009 --> 03:09.553
I love that top, by the way.

03:09.554 --> 03:12.308
Oh...

03:14.000 --> 03:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:23.832 --> 03:26.002
Hey, Dr. K, I'm so sorry.

03:26.003 --> 03:28.549
But the fiddle,
it's bumming everyone out.

03:28.550 --> 03:31.889
Yeah, I just cried while
performing a woman's pap smear.

03:31.890 --> 03:34.268
- She took it pretty personally.
- Yeah, man.

03:34.269 --> 03:36.815
I'm sorry. I'm just lovelorn.

03:36.816 --> 03:39.863
And if I'm being honest,
I'm a little tight.

03:39.864 --> 03:42.201
Dr. Hernandez found out about
his track record with ladies,

03:42.202 --> 03:43.579
and she's like, "Oh, hell no.

03:43.580 --> 03:45.375
I'm out of here. You nasty."

03:45.376 --> 03:48.213
It's true. Now I can't seem
to shake old Mary.

03:48.214 --> 03:50.510
She's like that Six Flags song,
destined to be stuck

03:50.511 --> 03:52.764
in my head forever.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.267
Have you tried wearing her down?

03:54.268 --> 03:56.062
- No.
- That's how Dr. Reed and I

03:56.063 --> 03:58.609
got girlfriends who wanted
nothing to do with us.

03:58.610 --> 04:00.738
We call ourselves the Termite Club.

04:00.739 --> 04:02.826
The Termite Club?

04:02.827 --> 04:05.873
You know how a single termite
can fell a majestic oak tree?

04:05.874 --> 04:08.336
- Sure.
- That's what Morgan and I do.

04:08.337 --> 04:11.927
Take Tamra and Anna.
We weaken magnificent women

04:11.928 --> 04:14.391
until they come crashing down.

04:14.392 --> 04:16.101
Here's the deal. Dr. Hernandez is

04:16.103 --> 04:17.271
is an amazing woman.
And you have no right

04:17.272 --> 04:18.899
- to date her.
- No.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.862
But with some patience,
some perseverance,

04:20.863 --> 04:23.492
and a little good old-fashioned
male white entitlement,

04:23.493 --> 04:25.663
you're gonna bring her crashing
down right into your bed.

04:25.664 --> 04:28.084
- Timber.
- Maybe that could work.

04:28.085 --> 04:30.047
I'll be a termite.

04:30.048 --> 04:31.800
I'm coming for you, Mary Hernandez,

04:31.801 --> 04:33.596
you sexy, unwilling tree.

04:34.933 --> 04:36.894
Ooh, Six Flags.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.200
Dr. Hernandez? There's a weird guy

04:44.201 --> 04:45.453
waiting for you in the lobby.

04:45.454 --> 04:47.457
Weird? How?

04:47.458 --> 04:50.128
He called me Buttercup and
asked me where I go to church.

04:50.129 --> 04:52.091
Ah, Jody Kimball-Kinney.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.054
Eh. Send him in.

04:57.143 --> 04:59.398
Mary,

04:59.399 --> 05:01.735
I know you think I'm a lech
who treats women terribly

05:01.736 --> 05:04.449
- and has weathered many STDs.
- Is that not true?

05:04.450 --> 05:06.369
No, you're right on the money.

05:06.370 --> 05:07.872
But I want you
to know that I've changed.

05:07.873 --> 05:09.584
And you don't have to answer me now,

05:09.585 --> 05:11.170
but you should know that
I intend to come here

05:11.171 --> 05:13.551
every day with a bouquet of flowers

05:13.552 --> 05:15.847
until you agree to let me take you out.

05:15.848 --> 05:17.726
Madam.

05:17.727 --> 05:19.228
What kind of flowers are these?

05:19.229 --> 05:20.732
Dogwood blossoms.

05:20.733 --> 05:22.444
They indicate unreciprocated love.

05:22.445 --> 05:23.946
That's what the homosexual gentleman

05:23.947 --> 05:25.198
at the flower store said.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.910
And what kind of flowers

05:26.911 --> 05:28.831
represent reciprocated affection?

05:28.832 --> 05:30.960
Oh, Ernesto told me this too.

05:30.961 --> 05:33.758
- Ah, Jonquils.
- Then bring me some of those

05:33.759 --> 05:35.093
when you pick me up tonight.

05:35.094 --> 05:36.847
- Tonight?
- 7:00?

05:36.848 --> 05:38.684
Heh, oh, my goodness.

05:38.685 --> 05:40.897
Uh, took me a while to work up
my nerve to come here,

05:40.898 --> 05:42.609
but, uh, that gives me five hours

05:42.610 --> 05:44.988
to sober up, so I should be okay.

05:44.989 --> 05:46.992
I just won't drive.
I'll see you at 7:00.

05:46.993 --> 05:48.913
Okay.

05:48.914 --> 05:50.583
She said yes.

05:53.715 --> 05:55.426
How's your lunch, Dr. L?

05:55.427 --> 05:57.388
Morgan, this is stupid.
Just come in here.

05:57.389 --> 05:59.141
I'm not gonna tell Tamra.

05:59.142 --> 06:01.563
Okay. Fine.

06:01.564 --> 06:02.816
Hey, no monkey business, all right?

06:02.817 --> 06:04.569
Wait, what's wrong?

06:04.570 --> 06:06.155
How come you're not wearing
your lunch sweats?

06:06.156 --> 06:09.579
I'm a little worried, Morgan.

06:09.580 --> 06:12.042
I saw Danny's mom in the oncology wing.

06:12.043 --> 06:14.381
Oh, well, the hospital's a big place.

06:14.382 --> 06:16.217
It's very easy to get lost.

06:16.218 --> 06:18.054
The other night, I followed
the sound of laughter

06:18.055 --> 06:20.225
to the morgue... no one was there.

06:20.226 --> 06:21.645
No, no. She had an appointment

06:21.646 --> 06:23.314
with a cancer specialist.

06:23.315 --> 06:24.401
And she made me promise
not to tell Danny.

06:24.402 --> 06:26.028
Well, can't do that,

06:26.029 --> 06:27.322
because it's private
medical information.

06:27.323 --> 06:28.826
Obviously. It's just, like,

06:28.827 --> 06:30.413
if it was my mom, I would wanna know.

06:30.414 --> 06:31.999
- Yeah, no, this is a classic...
- Hey.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.003
Oh, God, no! She tried to seduce me.

06:34.004 --> 06:35.297
Nothing happened yet. Don't tell Tamra.

06:35.298 --> 06:36.967
All right. Hey, Tamra

06:36.968 --> 06:38.679
just got back from shopping.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.307
She said she's gonna make us
some big dinner

06:40.308 --> 06:41.560
on Thursday night.

06:41.561 --> 06:43.229
I am gonna bring my appetite,

06:43.230 --> 06:44.691
'cause I'm trying to go
up a weight class.

06:44.692 --> 06:46.445
- I know.
- Hey, guys.

06:46.446 --> 06:48.407
I'm cooking a classic Siberian feast.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.826
I hope you like reindeer.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.538
Mark Bittman called the recipe,

06:51.539 --> 06:53.459
"an extremely acquired taste."

06:53.460 --> 06:57.550
Oh, that sounds so yummers.
Thank you, my bride.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.471
Morgan, you know you're not
allowed to thank me

06:59.472 --> 07:01.182
outside of marriage. Oh, my God.

07:01.183 --> 07:03.311
I gotta go soak some bark
for the goat stew.

07:03.312 --> 07:04.940
- Dosvidaniy'all.
- Good-bye, my love.

07:04.941 --> 07:06.860
Dasvidaniya. Mmm. Reindeer.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.614
So close to Christmas. I love you!

07:08.615 --> 07:10.701
Jody, I had so much fun tonight.

07:10.702 --> 07:12.580
I've never been carried
over a puddle before.

07:12.581 --> 07:13.999
Well, I had fun, too.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.337
And, Mary, if it's not too forward,

07:16.338 --> 07:17.799
I'd like to see you again.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.386
Maybe we could go for a bike ride

07:19.387 --> 07:21.807
or have a picnic
in a sculpture garden or...

07:21.808 --> 07:24.980
Or maybe we could have
our second date right now.

07:24.981 --> 07:26.942
Upstairs. My place.

07:26.943 --> 07:28.529
To ride bikes?

07:28.530 --> 07:30.323
You must have a very open floor plan.

07:30.324 --> 07:34.499
No, dummy. I mean for sex.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.712
Por favor.

07:36.713 --> 07:38.047
That means I like.

07:39.635 --> 07:41.012
Ooh,

07:41.013 --> 07:42.765
that was wonderful, Mary.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.309
Oh, you should come to Atlanta sometime.

07:44.310 --> 07:46.022
There's so much history.

07:46.023 --> 07:48.151
There's CNN, the Coca-Cola museum.

07:48.152 --> 07:49.988
They shoot "Walking Dead" there.

07:49.989 --> 07:51.825
I ran into that Asian fella
in the grocery store.

07:51.826 --> 07:55.958
Oh, sounds good, but I'll be gone soon.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.296
You're dying? I knew it.

07:58.297 --> 08:00.133
Another "Autumn in New York"
for old Jody.

08:00.134 --> 08:02.805
No, no. I'm just leaving the country.

08:02.806 --> 08:05.728
I'm gonna be with Physicians
on the Front for three years.

08:05.729 --> 08:07.940
Three years?

08:07.941 --> 08:09.778
Physicians on the Front?

08:09.779 --> 08:11.823
Isn't that where those doctors
rush into disasters

08:11.824 --> 08:13.410
in countries with no air conditioning?

08:13.411 --> 08:14.954
- Yeah.
- Why would you wanna do that?

08:14.955 --> 08:16.666
Because they do good work,

08:16.667 --> 08:19.464
and I wanna do something
important with my life.

08:19.465 --> 08:21.635
- Oh.
- Besides,

08:21.636 --> 08:24.974
we both know that this
isn't anything serious.

08:24.975 --> 08:27.229
- Right?
- Oh, yeah.

08:27.230 --> 08:28.732
It's way too early for me to be thinking

08:28.733 --> 08:30.318
about settling down, anyway.

08:30.319 --> 08:32.823
Pound sign "still young."

08:40.339 --> 08:42.342
Thanks for coming in. We can discuss

08:42.342 --> 08:44.514
your course of treatment on Wednesday.

08:44.515 --> 08:46.183
Will your friend Dot
be joining us again?

08:46.184 --> 08:47.770
Yes, I will. I'm wearing a wedding ring

08:47.771 --> 08:49.189
so I don't waste my time.

08:49.190 --> 08:50.985
Good-bye, Doc.

08:50.986 --> 08:53.449
- I'll see you on Wednesday.
- Course of treatment?

08:53.450 --> 08:54.909
Annette.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.205
You have to tell me what's going on.

08:57.206 --> 08:58.834
Fine.

08:58.835 --> 09:01.381
During my last mammogram,
they found a lump.

09:01.382 --> 09:03.635
- It's malignant.
- Oh, my God, Annette.

09:03.636 --> 09:07.142
I am so sorry.
Wait, why isn't Danny here?

09:07.143 --> 09:08.645
Because he doesn't know.

09:08.646 --> 09:10.190
That's why I didn't go to his hospital.

09:10.191 --> 09:11.735
Why didn't you want Danny to know?

09:11.736 --> 09:13.321
Because he's gonna freak out.

09:13.322 --> 09:15.033
And this is very treatable.

09:15.034 --> 09:16.536
In a month, it'll be
like it never happened.

09:16.537 --> 09:18.540
- Fine, but you still...
- Stop.

09:18.541 --> 09:20.251
I have given this a lot of thought.

09:20.252 --> 09:22.172
This is how I wanna handle it.

09:22.173 --> 09:27.057
And if you tell Danny,
I will never forgive you.

09:27.058 --> 09:31.357
And I am Sicilian. That means something.

09:31.358 --> 09:33.110
It's true. You ever hear her talk

09:33.111 --> 09:34.906
- about her sister Joan?
- No.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.285
Exactly. Let's go.

09:43.334 --> 09:45.323
Okay, you are all set.

09:45.348 --> 09:46.761
I'm just gonna be
right down the hallway,

09:46.786 --> 09:48.136
so if you experience any discomfort,

09:48.161 --> 09:50.357
just press that button
and I'll be right over.

09:50.678 --> 09:52.180
I'm already not loving this chair.

09:52.275 --> 09:54.362
The button is for Annette, ma'am.

09:55.654 --> 09:57.699
Annette. Dot.

09:57.724 --> 09:59.581
Really? What are you doing here?

09:59.582 --> 10:02.252
Look, I know that you
don't want Danny to know.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.424
But now that I know,
I might as well be helpful.

10:04.425 --> 10:06.010
I have this under control.

10:06.011 --> 10:07.805
I've seen every episode
of "Chicago Med."

10:07.806 --> 10:10.226
"Dr. Halstead, there's a crash on the L.

10:10.227 --> 10:13.065
Bring the paddles
and an intubator, stat."

10:13.066 --> 10:15.069
- See? I got this.
- Here's the deal.

10:15.070 --> 10:16.740
You are Leo's grandmother.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.869
And you're my family.
And now that I know,

10:18.870 --> 10:20.664
I'm obviously gonna get involved.

10:20.665 --> 10:22.042
And honestly, if you put up
any more resistance,

10:22.043 --> 10:23.545
I'm gonna tell Danny.

10:23.546 --> 10:25.173
Blackmailing a cancer patient...

10:25.174 --> 10:26.968
They have this on "Chicago Med."

10:26.969 --> 10:28.597
All right, all right,
all right, look, Mindy.

10:28.598 --> 10:29.932
You wanna stay, good.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.728
Just sit and keep to yourself.

10:31.729 --> 10:32.980
Thank you so much.

10:32.981 --> 10:34.400
You will not regret this.

10:34.401 --> 10:37.030
- I will be like a ghost.
- Mm-hmm.

10:37.031 --> 10:38.408
You will not even know that I'm here.

10:38.409 --> 10:40.162
Great.

10:41.707 --> 10:43.293
Like a ghost.

10:45.507 --> 10:47.552
You won't even know that I'm here.

10:50.224 --> 10:51.726
Morgan, where are your scrubs?

10:51.727 --> 10:53.145
Look, we would all like to wear

10:53.146 --> 10:54.314
our peasant tops around the office,

10:54.315 --> 10:55.818
but it's not professional.

10:55.819 --> 10:57.362
All right, Tamra bought this for me,

10:57.363 --> 10:58.865
and she'll be very mad if I take it off.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.828
But if you forbade me from wearing it,

11:00.829 --> 11:03.207
- I would have to take it off.
- Are you insane?

11:03.208 --> 11:04.627
She'll come after me.

11:04.628 --> 11:06.798
Whoa, Jody. All right.

11:06.799 --> 11:08.259
Normally you're more secretive

11:08.260 --> 11:09.804
about your daytime work drinking.

11:09.805 --> 11:11.056
Well, I just don't have the energy

11:11.057 --> 11:12.685
to keep up appearances today.

11:12.686 --> 11:14.897
It's Mary. Things aren't going well.

11:14.898 --> 11:18.112
You know why?
Because she's too good for you.

11:18.113 --> 11:19.782
Did I offend you? Are you gonna force me

11:19.783 --> 11:21.034
- to take off my Russian shirt?
- No,

11:21.035 --> 11:22.705
we've already slept together.

11:22.706 --> 11:24.291
Well, then why the hell
are you complaining?

11:24.292 --> 11:26.336
Jody, you don't need the Termite Club.

11:26.337 --> 11:29.176
You just felled Mary like you
were some Dutch elm disease.

11:29.177 --> 11:30.971
Mary just wants to have a fling

11:30.972 --> 11:32.516
before she goes off
to Physicians on the Front.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.520
Médicins Sur Le Front?

11:34.521 --> 11:36.483
Oh, they're a wonderful organization.

11:36.484 --> 11:38.194
Do not let her go.

11:38.195 --> 11:40.156
Okay, she will meet a charming Frenchman

11:40.157 --> 11:42.035
named Jacques in linen pants
and salt-and-pepper scruff.

11:42.036 --> 11:43.622
- Oh, for...
- Ooh, sounds hot.

11:43.623 --> 11:45.333
I'd pick him over you.

11:45.334 --> 11:47.086
You know, Jody,
you made the classic mistake.

11:47.087 --> 11:49.007
Once you find a woman
who's too good for you,

11:49.008 --> 11:50.803
you gotta trap her with the one weakness

11:50.804 --> 11:52.389
that all women share.

11:52.390 --> 11:54.184
Chocolate? The friendship of gay men?

11:54.185 --> 11:56.271
Volkswagen Jettas? Uh...

11:56.272 --> 11:57.775
No. Fear.

11:57.776 --> 11:59.403
- Yeah.
- Fear.

11:59.404 --> 12:01.073
You gotta make her
so scared for her future

12:01.074 --> 12:03.829
that you are the only
safe, viable option.

12:03.830 --> 12:05.206
God, you're such an idiot.

12:05.207 --> 12:06.543
- Right?
- Did I offend you now?

12:06.544 --> 12:08.337
- Mm.
- Please make me

12:08.338 --> 12:10.049
take off the shirt.
Say, "Morgan, take it off."

12:12.179 --> 12:14.266
Hey, you guys haven't had
any of these cookies.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.853
They're from the best bakery
in Manhattan.

12:15.854 --> 12:16.938
Well, that must be the problem.

12:16.939 --> 12:18.483
Too fancy.

12:18.484 --> 12:20.361
I just prefer a plain American cookie.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.451
Annette. We should schedule

12:23.452 --> 12:24.829
your next chemo appointment.

12:24.830 --> 12:26.833
How about next Thursday?

12:26.834 --> 12:28.795
Uh, no. Won't work.

12:28.796 --> 12:30.214
Father Michael is coming for supper.

12:30.215 --> 12:31.926
I have to clean all day.

12:31.927 --> 12:33.680
Uh, how about
the following Monday, then?

12:33.681 --> 12:35.308
No good. We got tickets

12:35.309 --> 12:37.730
at Mohegan Sun to see two
of the Four Seasons.

12:37.731 --> 12:39.400
- Yes, we do.
- Annette,

12:39.401 --> 12:41.236
I think it's important
that you try to keep

12:41.237 --> 12:42.781
kind of a consistent schedule

12:42.782 --> 12:44.326
with your chemotherapy appointments.

12:44.327 --> 12:46.121
And I think it's important for her

12:46.122 --> 12:48.460
to have a sense of normalcy
during this tragic time.

12:48.461 --> 12:50.380
I don't totally disagree with that.

12:50.381 --> 12:52.300
I just think that a cancer
treatment is more important

12:52.301 --> 12:54.137
than you two going to an Indian casino.

12:54.138 --> 12:56.476
Okay, well, if you can't do
Thursday or Monday,

12:56.477 --> 12:58.855
our next appointment
isn't until two weeks out.

12:58.856 --> 13:00.817
- Fine, I'll take that.
- No, no, no, no.

13:00.818 --> 13:02.195
We should make one sooner than that.

13:02.196 --> 13:04.157
Mindy, this is exactly why

13:04.158 --> 13:05.911
I didn't want you to get involved.

13:05.912 --> 13:08.248
You always want
to take control of everything.

13:08.249 --> 13:09.460
I think you should leave.

13:09.461 --> 13:11.673
Okay. I guess I'll go.

13:11.674 --> 13:13.300
And I'll take my cookies with me.

13:13.301 --> 13:14.720
No!

13:14.721 --> 13:16.056
I wanna give them to my neighbor.

13:16.057 --> 13:17.643
Fine.

13:20.232 --> 13:23.571
She's gone. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

13:23.572 --> 13:25.032
- Mmm!
- Oh, my God.

13:25.033 --> 13:26.995
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

13:26.996 --> 13:29.417
Zdra-stu-it-eh, everyone.

13:29.418 --> 13:32.506
Welcome to the frigid world
of Siberian cuisine.

13:32.507 --> 13:35.011
I've worked all day preparing
you the finest pickled fish

13:35.012 --> 13:36.556
and jellied meats. I hope you guys

13:36.557 --> 13:38.183
brought your appetites.

13:38.184 --> 13:39.395
Hey, Morgan.

13:39.396 --> 13:40.897
I don't mean to be rude,

13:40.898 --> 13:43.277
but this food looks gross as hell.

13:43.278 --> 13:44.739
That is xenophobic, okay?

13:44.740 --> 13:46.241
Like Southern food is so delicious.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.580
Yeah, it is. Famously so.

13:48.581 --> 13:50.124
It's the one thing
that's redeemed the South

13:50.125 --> 13:51.961
from all the bad stuff we've done.

13:51.962 --> 13:53.423
Hey, let's just order a pizza.

13:53.424 --> 13:54.508
- I got it.
- No, no.

13:54.509 --> 13:56.136
We're not ordering pizza.

13:56.137 --> 13:57.473
- She's gonna see it.
- No, no, we love pizza.

13:57.474 --> 13:59.184
It tastes so good and normal.

13:59.185 --> 14:00.562
- I know what it tastes like.
- Hey, Cortana.

14:00.563 --> 14:02.524
I need pizza.

14:02.525 --> 14:04.945
I found five pizza places near you.

14:04.946 --> 14:06.699
Perfect, I'll order
a pizza from each place.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.243
You know, I don't know about you,

14:08.244 --> 14:10.039
but my problem is, is I don't know

14:10.040 --> 14:12.084
which delicacy to start with.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.295
I'm just gonna go

14:13.296 --> 14:15.174
for the fish and jelly.

14:15.175 --> 14:18.223
Hey, if you like it so much,
put it in your mouth.

14:21.980 --> 14:23.983
- Swallow it, dude.
- I did.

14:23.984 --> 14:25.236
Mm-mm. Swallow it.

14:25.237 --> 14:26.238
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.829
Here comes the borscht, extra sour...

14:29.830 --> 14:31.624
Oh, yes.

14:31.625 --> 14:33.878
Did you just spit out my jelly trout?

14:33.879 --> 14:35.590
I spent the whole day making that.

14:35.591 --> 14:36.968
The trout kept jumping out of the jelly.

14:36.969 --> 14:38.471
Okay, baby, baby, listen.

14:38.472 --> 14:40.099
It was a pure chemical reaction, okay?

14:40.100 --> 14:42.479
My body rejected it
because of the taste.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.065
- Well, I curse you.
- No.

14:44.066 --> 14:47.238
- May you get lost in the snow.
- No, no!

14:47.239 --> 14:48.783
And I'm about to ask you something,

14:48.784 --> 14:50.369
that's, uh... it's a big step for me.

14:50.370 --> 14:52.541
- Uh-oh.
- You wanna go for breakfast?

14:52.542 --> 14:54.378
No.

14:54.379 --> 14:55.797
I mean, I do, but I can't.

14:55.798 --> 14:57.300
- I've got orientation.
- Oh.

14:57.301 --> 14:58.595
For the Physicians on the Front.

14:58.596 --> 15:00.432
Oh...

15:00.433 --> 15:02.351
We'll have to make sure
you get your vaccinations.

15:02.352 --> 15:03.855
We wouldn't want you to get malaria.

15:03.856 --> 15:05.357
Well, of course I have vaccinations.

15:05.358 --> 15:07.111
And I'll also have a mosquito net.

15:07.112 --> 15:08.615
You know what a mosquito net
doesn't keep out?

15:08.616 --> 15:10.493
Boko Haram.

15:10.494 --> 15:13.583
The country that I'm going to
doesn't have Boko Haram.

15:13.584 --> 15:15.921
Oh, no. They... they've all
been eaten by lions?

15:15.922 --> 15:17.256
Okay.

15:17.257 --> 15:19.052
Stop. I see what you're doing.

15:19.053 --> 15:21.432
You are trying to scare me
to keep me from going.

15:21.433 --> 15:23.603
What? I'm not trying to scare you.

15:23.604 --> 15:25.482
- The facts are.
- I wanna do something

15:25.483 --> 15:27.736
good for the world using
my skills as a doctor.

15:27.737 --> 15:28.905
- Sure.
- And I wish that

15:28.906 --> 15:30.742
you could support that.

15:30.743 --> 15:32.746
No, I just wish you found
some problems in New York

15:32.747 --> 15:35.752
where the situation isn't
a total waste of your time.

15:35.753 --> 15:37.756
- A total waste of my time?
- Don't worry.

15:37.757 --> 15:39.843
Come on, blow off the meeting.
Stay here.

15:39.844 --> 15:41.807
Let's have sex again.

15:44.813 --> 15:47.985
- I think you should go.
- Oh.

15:47.986 --> 15:49.655
Oh...

15:52.160 --> 15:53.997
- Hello?
- It's Nurse Chris

15:53.998 --> 15:55.625
- from oncology.
- You know what?

15:55.626 --> 15:57.462
We gave you back
your stupid popcorn machine.

15:57.463 --> 15:59.633
Now my salt level's so low,
my shoes fell off.

15:59.634 --> 16:01.136
- I hope you're happy.
- I'm only happy

16:01.137 --> 16:02.723
when Brooke is teaching SoulCycle.

16:02.724 --> 16:04.350
I'm calling about Annette Castellano.

16:04.351 --> 16:06.397
Oh. Is she okay?

16:06.398 --> 16:08.316
She's asking for you.
Or more accurately,

16:08.317 --> 16:10.029
shrieking for you.

16:10.030 --> 16:11.906
Oh, Mindy! Mindy, come quick!

16:11.931 --> 16:13.852
Dot is trying to kill me!

16:21.135 --> 16:23.350
Dr. Lahiri, never thought
I'd be happy to see you.

16:23.375 --> 16:24.897
- They're still at it?
- Yes.

16:24.922 --> 16:26.897
Do you know how bad this is?
Two old women are feuding,

16:26.922 --> 16:28.441
- and I'm not even enjoying it.
- Okay.

16:28.442 --> 16:30.612
Read a paper!
People do this all the time!

16:30.613 --> 16:32.156
Hey, hey, hey!
What the hell is going on?

16:32.157 --> 16:33.701
Mindy, this woman is a vulture.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.604
She's a vulture. Get her away from me.

16:35.629 --> 16:37.548
- She wants my money!
- I don't need your money!

16:37.573 --> 16:39.922
I have my slip-and-fall
settlement from Loehmann's.

16:39.923 --> 16:41.216
Get out. Get out. Go on.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.136
- Fine! Fine.
- Go!

16:43.137 --> 16:45.475
I'll go, but when you recover,

16:45.476 --> 16:48.021
you'll have to borrow
somebody else's Costco card.

16:48.022 --> 16:50.985
Backstabber.

16:50.986 --> 16:53.741
You got a Costco card, right?

16:53.742 --> 16:55.119
I... I don't.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.586
Tam, can we talk for a sec?

16:59.587 --> 17:01.172
Why, so you can insult me again?

17:02.677 --> 17:04.137
I'm sorry about last night, okay?

17:04.137 --> 17:05.890
And I... I appreciate you taking

17:05.891 --> 17:07.560
such an interest in my people's culture.

17:07.561 --> 17:09.690
Are you kidding me? I hate it.

17:09.691 --> 17:12.069
The food stinks,
the clothes are hella scratchy,

17:12.069 --> 17:13.781
and I'm just gonna say it,

17:13.781 --> 17:15.660
"War and Peace"
would benefit from editing.

17:15.661 --> 17:17.246
But then, wait, why are you
doing all this stuff?

17:17.247 --> 17:19.667
Because it's a tradition.

17:19.669 --> 17:21.422
And everything else
about our relationship

17:21.423 --> 17:22.715
is so nontraditional.

17:22.717 --> 17:24.595
Getting pregnant before marriage,

17:24.596 --> 17:26.765
dating a coworker who eats garbage...

17:26.766 --> 17:28.310
Eats out of the garbage.

17:28.310 --> 17:29.938
I just thought a little tradition

17:29.939 --> 17:31.525
would give us a stronger foundation

17:31.526 --> 17:33.654
to build the rest
of our lives together on.

17:33.655 --> 17:36.911
Tam, if you wanna do
something traditional,

17:36.912 --> 17:39.500
I would be honored
if you took my last name.

17:39.501 --> 17:42.506
Tamra Tookers? I like that.

17:42.507 --> 17:44.133
- Yes.
- But to be clear,

17:44.134 --> 17:46.388
I'm gonna continue to be
Tamra Webb on IMDB.

17:46.389 --> 17:47.974
I'm gonna change my name to Morgan Webb.

17:47.975 --> 17:50.563
- Mmm, nah.
- Doesn't sound correct.

17:50.564 --> 17:52.149
Now that we can be alone
in a room together...

17:52.150 --> 17:54.571
- Come here.
- Get over here.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.286
Hey, Dr. K.
I just wanted to let you know

17:58.287 --> 18:00.458
I don't have Siberian
dietary restrictions anymore,

18:00.459 --> 18:02.546
so I finished all your pork rinds.

18:02.547 --> 18:04.131
That's okay. Nothing tastes sweet

18:04.132 --> 18:05.385
to me right now.

18:05.386 --> 18:07.931
Not even deep fried pork skin.

18:07.932 --> 18:09.810
What's wrong? Are you finally regretting

18:09.811 --> 18:10.979
that vote in November?

18:10.980 --> 18:12.482
No.

18:12.483 --> 18:14.026
It's Mary.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.572
I tried to scare
her ambitions out of her.

18:15.573 --> 18:16.991
Keep her in America.

18:16.992 --> 18:18.619
Why would you try to scare her?

18:18.620 --> 18:20.665
Women have enough
to worry about these days.

18:20.666 --> 18:23.128
Like, gaucho pants
are making a comeback.

18:23.129 --> 18:25.048
Can I pull them off?
I mean, of course I can,

18:25.049 --> 18:26.510
but most women can't.

18:26.511 --> 18:28.346
I just don't want to lose her.

18:28.347 --> 18:30.267
You know she's gonna meet
someone better on her trip.

18:30.268 --> 18:32.313
She's gonna sleep with that Dr. Jacque.

18:32.314 --> 18:35.277
That's an imaginary man that
Morgan and Jeremy made up.

18:35.278 --> 18:37.114
So Dr. Reed and Morgan
told you to do that?

18:37.115 --> 18:39.160
Yeah. Morgan said the only reason

18:39.161 --> 18:41.624
you're with him is
'cause he first wore you down,

18:41.625 --> 18:43.628
then he made you feel like
you couldn't do any better.

18:43.629 --> 18:45.465
Jeremy did the same thing with Anna.

18:45.466 --> 18:48.429
Look, first of all, everyone
knows I could do better.

18:48.430 --> 18:50.683
But I don't want better. I want Morgan.

18:50.684 --> 18:52.896
- Mm-mm...
- I do.

18:52.897 --> 18:55.150
'Cause he's nice, and he's funny,

18:55.151 --> 18:57.405
and most important, he supports me.

18:57.406 --> 18:59.116
Isn't that all any partner wants?

18:59.117 --> 19:01.079
It's true,
I haven't been very supportive.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.166
I just forwarded a YouTube video
about the dangers

19:03.167 --> 19:04.753
of African quicksand to her.

19:04.754 --> 19:06.674
Ugh. Well, it's worth a try.

19:06.675 --> 19:09.596
Because despite your alcoholism
and your Republicanism

19:09.597 --> 19:11.934
and a bunch of other isms,

19:11.935 --> 19:13.479
you're actually a good guy.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.483
- Well, thanks, Tamra.
- All right.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.115
Gretchen, I know that
you're scared of pooping,

19:19.116 --> 19:21.244
but you've gotta push.

19:21.245 --> 19:22.789
It's too late for the epidural, Phil.

19:22.790 --> 19:25.127
- Thank you.
- Is it too late for love?

19:25.128 --> 19:27.424
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm your doctor's boyfriend,

19:27.425 --> 19:29.386
Jody Kimball-Kinney.
And I'm the man who's gonna

19:29.387 --> 19:30.972
- go to Africa with her.
- What?

19:30.973 --> 19:33.059
- You're not coming with me.
- Why not?

19:33.060 --> 19:35.063
It's a great organization,
and I wanna support you.

19:35.064 --> 19:37.151
God, you're beautiful, honey.
I think I love you.

19:37.152 --> 19:40.491
- I... I don't know what to say.
- Say yes!

19:40.492 --> 19:42.077
You're always complaining
about how lonely you are.

19:42.078 --> 19:43.914
Gretchen, shh. Just push.

19:43.915 --> 19:46.043
I want the first thing
my baby sees to be real love.

19:46.044 --> 19:48.006
Not a failed relationship.

19:48.007 --> 19:49.634
Or my poop.

19:49.635 --> 19:52.515
Okay, I guess you can come.

19:52.516 --> 19:54.519
Ah, you've made me
the happiest man in the world.

19:55.898 --> 19:57.609
Oh, the little guy's coming.

19:57.610 --> 19:58.861
- You'd better get back in there.
- Oh, okay.

19:58.862 --> 20:00.363
- I love you.
- Okay.

20:00.364 --> 20:02.786
Africa!

20:02.787 --> 20:04.790
Annette, now that you've calmed down,

20:04.791 --> 20:06.710
what were you two
fighting about, anyway?

20:06.711 --> 20:08.714
Dot wants me to write a will.

20:08.715 --> 20:11.260
- You don't have a will?
- Of course not.

20:11.261 --> 20:14.684
Wills are for dead people.
Here I am fighting for my life

20:14.685 --> 20:16.354
with cancer, and she's already

20:16.355 --> 20:17.732
planning for my death.

20:17.733 --> 20:19.736
Some friend.

20:19.737 --> 20:22.700
Annette, I want to be supportive of you.

20:22.701 --> 20:25.456
But I would also like permission
to speak honestly with you.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.334
Oh, sure. I can take it.

20:27.335 --> 20:29.631
You are straight up loco in the coco.

20:29.632 --> 20:31.802
- You need a will.
- You, too?

20:31.803 --> 20:33.346
What do you want?

20:33.347 --> 20:35.183
You wouldn't fit into any of my clothes.

20:35.184 --> 20:36.812
- Believe me.
- You're right.

20:36.813 --> 20:38.774
Because what I want
is a lavender sweatshirt

20:38.775 --> 20:40.695
with a picture of a watering can on it.

20:40.696 --> 20:43.659
No, everybody needs a will.
And if you don't have one,

20:43.660 --> 20:46.372
it could lead to huge taxes
or family fights.

20:46.373 --> 20:48.251
- You got a will?
- Yeah, of course.

20:48.252 --> 20:49.963
The minute I got pregnant with Leo.

20:49.964 --> 20:51.925
And it's not just about
finances or figuring out

20:51.926 --> 20:54.472
who's gonna take care of him
if something happens to me.

20:54.473 --> 20:56.183
It's also my end-of-life wishes.

20:56.184 --> 20:57.937
For instance, should I go brain dead,

20:57.938 --> 20:59.273
I would like to be smothered to death

20:59.274 --> 21:01.403
with my Oscar Isaac pillow.

21:04.367 --> 21:07.874
I guess I never thought about it.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.377
When you spend your whole life

21:09.378 --> 21:11.798
waiting for the next shoe to drop,

21:11.799 --> 21:13.510
you don't spend much time wondering

21:13.511 --> 21:15.389
who's gonna get the shoes.

21:15.390 --> 21:18.896
Look, this is not easy.
But in the meantime,

21:18.897 --> 21:21.818
you should be leaning on people
like me and Dot.

21:21.819 --> 21:24.156
You would be easy to lean on.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.578
Your body's like a bean bag,
and you're bottom heavy,

21:26.579 --> 21:28.582
- so you won't wobble.
- Okay.

21:28.583 --> 21:31.546
Thank you for not telling Danny.

21:31.547 --> 21:33.884
You're welcome, but I think
you should tell Danny.

21:33.885 --> 21:35.846
I mean, what if he finds out
from somebody else?

21:35.847 --> 21:37.392
Oh, how's he gonna hear about it?

21:37.393 --> 21:39.437
The only people who know are you, Dot,

21:39.438 --> 21:41.817
and the ticket taker at "Hello, Dolly!"

21:41.818 --> 21:44.238
- I thought it would get me in.
- Hmm.

21:44.239 --> 21:45.866
So this is Shulman & Associates.

21:45.867 --> 21:48.080
It's cute. It's so economical.

21:49.667 --> 21:52.129
Watch out, Dr. Reed.
It's that mean gay nurse

21:52.130 --> 21:54.341
- from oncology.
- Aren't gay people

21:54.342 --> 21:56.095
supposed to be nice and funny?

21:56.096 --> 21:58.349
No, gay guys are mean-funny.

21:58.350 --> 22:00.311
Lesbians are nice-funny, like Ellen.

22:00.312 --> 22:02.483
- Oh, hello.
- Please don't mock me.

22:02.484 --> 22:03.902
I know I over-groom my eyebrows.

22:03.903 --> 22:05.573
No, I came to drop this off

22:05.574 --> 22:07.618
for the loud Indian woman
who works here.

22:07.619 --> 22:09.414
Annette Castellano left it in oncology.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.916
I'd bring it back
to Staten Island myself,

22:10.917 --> 22:12.462
but I have too many exes there.

22:12.463 --> 22:14.549
What was Annette doing in oncology?

22:14.550 --> 22:17.137
Oh, no. She's not a patient, is she?

22:17.138 --> 22:19.058
HIPPA prevents me from
confirming or denying that,

22:19.059 --> 22:21.438
but read my neck.

22:21.439 --> 22:23.066
Oh, no.

22:23.067 --> 22:25.946
Poor Annette. Poor Danny.

22:25.947 --> 22:28.326
I'm gonna drop this off at his place.

22:28.327 --> 22:30.956
I'm sure he wants to talk about this.

22:30.957 --> 22:32.961
Go to bed.
