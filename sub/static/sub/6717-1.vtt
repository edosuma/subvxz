it's all true.

to actually read her statement?

22:37.625 --> 22:39.375

the statement to contain?

23:09.792 --> 23:11.750

between pleading guilty

23:11.875 --> 23:13.042

38:08.125 --> 38:10.875
Which reminds me, check yourself
for fleas tonight.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.042

38:13.167 --> 38:14.875
- iIf nobody wants them.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.750
- And you don't mind
doing the job?

38:16.875 --> 38:17.958

38:18.083 --> 38:19.125
Settle down.

38:19.250 --> 38:20.292
I do mind.

38:20.417 --> 38:22.542
Hey!
I mind deeply.

38:22.667 --> 38:26.917
And I wouldn't want someone
doing it for me who didn't mind.

Would you?

They come back every year,
the same three.

38:59.208 --> 39:03.833
I'm so lucky to be visited,
the one chosen.

39:03.958 --> 39:08.167
- Animals are creatures
of habit.

39:16.250 --> 39:17.542
When you were small,

39:17.667 --> 39:21.083
our next-door neighbor
had a dog, a golden retriever.

39:21.208 --> 39:22.250
Remember?

39:22.375 --> 39:23.417
- Dimly.

39:23.542 --> 39:24.792
- It was a male,

39:24.917 --> 39:28.708
and whenever a bitch went past,
it got excited, unmanageable,

39:28.833 --> 39:30.667
and with Pavlovian regularity,

39:30.792 --> 39:34.417
its owner would beat it so that
at the mere smell of a bitch,

39:34.542 --> 39:37.667
the dog would run around
the garden with its ears fiat

39:37.792 --> 39:42.792
and its tail between its legs,
whining and trying to hide.

39:42.917 --> 39:44.125
- I don't see the point.

39:44.250 --> 39:48.250
- Well, you can punish a dog
for chewing a slipper.

39:48.375 --> 39:50.125
The dog can accept that.

39:50.250 --> 39:52.042
But desire is another story.

39:52.167 --> 39:54.375
- Is that the moral?

39:54.500 --> 39:58.208
Males must be allowed to follow
their instincts unchecked?

39:58.333 --> 40:00.375
- No, that's not the moral.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.375
What was ignoble
about the spectacle

40:02.500 --> 40:07.542
was that the poor dog had begun
to hate its own nature.

40:07.667 --> 40:09.875
It no longer
needed to be beaten.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.875
It punished itself.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.250
At that point, it would've been
better to shoot it.

40:16.375 --> 40:19.083
- Have you always felt this way?

40:19.208 --> 40:20.250
- No.

40:20.375 --> 40:23.333
At times,
I've felt just the opposite,

40:23.458 --> 40:26.917

we could well do without.

01:05:06.042 --> 01:05:08.292
Do you know who this is?

01:05:08.417 --> 01:05:09.458
- What is the trouble?

01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:10.875
- He is one of them.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.208
Ask Lucy.

01:05:12.333 --> 01:05:14.708
Ask him why the police
are looking for him.

01:05:14.833 --> 01:05:16.667
- It's not true!

01:05:21.875 --> 01:05:23.893
- He says he does not know
what you are talking about.

01:05:23.917 --> 01:05:25.167
- He's lying.

01:05:28.917 --> 01:05:31.000
I'm going to telephone
the police.

01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:39.167
- If you call the police,

01:05:39.292 --> 01:05:41.500
it will destroy
the evening for Petrus.

01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:42.667
- Really?

01:05:42.792 --> 01:05:44.167
Lucy, I fail to understand why

01:05:44.292 --> 01:05:48.000
you did not lay real charges
against them in the first place.

01:05:48.125 --> 01:05:50.542
And why are you
protecting Petrus now?

01:05:50.667 --> 01:05:51.708
Petrus is with them!

01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:53.708
- Don't shout at me!

01:05:53.833 --> 01:05:54.875
This is my life!

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.042
I'm the one
who has to live here!

01:05:57.167 --> 01:06:01.208
- Lucy, if you're too scared
to call the police now,

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:03.393
we should never have involved
them in the first place.

01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:06.875
We should've just kept quiet
and waited for the next attack

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.083
or cut our own throats.

01:06:08.208 --> 01:06:10.875
- Stop it, David!

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.375
You don't know what happened.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.208
- I don't know?

01:06:14.333 --> 01:06:15.875
Why do you keep saying that?

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.750
- You don't begin to know.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.708
- Lucy, please.

01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:25.375
If you buckle now,

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.792
you won't be able
to live with yourself.

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:30.750
If you show you're afraid,
you're finished.

01:06:30.875 --> 01:06:34.792
Please let me call the police.

01:06:39.917 --> 01:06:42.167
- No.

01:07:40.375 --> 01:07:44.042
[knocks on door]

01:07:44.167 --> 01:07:45.542
- Can I borrow some tools?

01:07:45.667 --> 01:07:47.708
I have to put in my PVC pipes.

01:07:47.833 --> 01:07:51.167
And could you help me
fit the regulator?

01:07:51.292 --> 01:07:54.583
- I don't know anything
about regulators or plumbing.

01:07:54.708 --> 01:07:56.125
- It is not plumbing.

01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:57.292
It is pipe fitting.

01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:59.958
Just laying pipes.

01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:16.542
Lucy has given her permission
for the pipes to cross her land.

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:20.250
She is forward-looking, Lucy,
not backward-looking.

01:08:20.375 --> 01:08:23.542
- Petrus, the boy,
what's his name?

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:25.042
- Yes.

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:28.832
He is angry
you are calling him a thief.

01:08:28.957 --> 01:08:32.542
It is hard for me,
as I must keep the peace.

01:08:32.667 --> 01:08:34.875
- I have no intention
of getting you involved.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.042
I need the boy's name,

01:08:36.167 --> 01:08:37.792
and the police
can take care of it.

01:08:37.917 --> 01:08:42.375
- But the insurance will
give you a new car, new TV.

01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:47.042
- The insurance
will not give me a new car.

01:08:47.167 --> 01:08:50.000
They will give me a percentage
of what the old car was worth,

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.332
if they're not bankrupt by now

01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:53.042
with all the car theft
in this country.

01:08:53.167 --> 01:08:55.375
Besides,
it's Lucy that's the issue.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.957
You know what happened to her.

01:08:57.082 --> 01:09:00.000
- Yes, I know what happened.

01:09:00.125 --> 01:09:01.167
But now it is all right.

01:09:01.292 --> 01:09:03.042
- Who says it's all right?

01:09:03.167 --> 01:09:04.417
- I say.

01:09:04.542 --> 01:09:05.582
I will protect her.

01:09:05.707 --> 01:09:07.832
- You didn't the last time.

01:09:07.957 --> 01:09:10.207
And now one of them
is your friend.

01:09:10.332 --> 01:09:12.792
- The boy is not a criminal.

01:09:12.917 --> 01:09:14.875
He is not guilty.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.167
He is too young.

01:09:16.292 --> 01:09:18.207
- What can I say?

01:09:18.332 --> 01:09:20.500
You know everything.

01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:21.875
Do you need me any longer?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.750
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

01:09:23.875 --> 01:09:27.292
No, now it is easy.

01:09:27.417 --> 01:09:31.250
Now I must just dig the pipe in.

01:09:37.167 --> 01:09:39.042
- You underestimate Petrus.

01:09:39.167 --> 01:09:42.417
He slaved to get that
market garden going for Lucy.

01:09:42.542 --> 01:09:44.082
I'm not saying
she owes him everything,

01:09:44.207 --> 01:09:47.375
but she owes him a lot.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:51.542
- In my opinion, he's itching
for Lucy to pull out.

01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:54.207
Made sure he wasn't home,
no warning, nothing.

01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:58.500
Now he's turning a blind eye.

01:09:58.625 --> 01:10:01.167
- Poor Lucy.

01:10:01.292 --> 01:10:04.792
First Helen leaves, now this.

01:10:04.917 --> 01:10:07.292
She's been through such a lot.

01:10:07.417 --> 01:10:09.167
- I know what Lucy's
been through.

01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:11.542
I was there.

01:10:11.667 --> 01:10:13.625
- But you weren't there, David.

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.500
She told me.
You weren't.

01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:18.292
I'm ready.

01:10:18.417 --> 01:10:20.708
Can you bring in the next dog?

01:10:30.833 --> 01:10:33.917
Hello, my girl.

01:10:39.542 --> 01:10:41.833
That's it.

01:10:47.625 --> 01:10:49.208
That's my girl.

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.042
That's my girl.

01:10:51.167 --> 01:10:55.000
Come on, then.
Good girl.

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.000
That's my girl.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.208
Here we go.

01:11:01.333 --> 01:11:05.333
Good girl, come on.

01:11:05.458 --> 01:11:06.500
That's it, sweetheart.

01:11:06.625 --> 01:11:07.708
That's my girl.

01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:19.458
- For each correct answer,
you win a prize.

01:13:19.583 --> 01:13:21.042
I'm gonna ask you two questions.

01:13:21.167 --> 01:13:23.292
Your first prize is a...

01:13:23.417 --> 01:13:24.458
steam iron.

01:13:24.583 --> 01:13:25.667
- Oh, excellent!

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:27.875
- Okay, now here's
your first question.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.750
What is the entertainment center
of New York called?

01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:33.833
Is it Green Market?

01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:38.667
- I'll do that.

01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:40.208
You'll be wanting to get back.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:44.292
- I'm in no hurry.

01:13:44.417 --> 01:13:47.333
- You must find it dull here,

01:13:47.458 --> 01:13:49.125
miss your own circle of friends,

01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:51.708
particularly your women friends.

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:54.542
- Women friends
didn't bring me much luck.

01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:58.708
- Do you regret it?

01:13:58.833 --> 01:14:00.542
- No, of course not.

01:14:00.667 --> 01:14:03.208
In the heat of the act,
there are no regrets.

01:14:03.333 --> 01:14:05.625
You must know that.

01:14:08.208 --> 01:14:11.667
- You must find Grahamstown
very quiet by comparison.

01:14:11.792 --> 01:14:14.167
- At least I'm out of the way
of temptation.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
[chain saw revving]

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.500
[telephone ringing]

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:17.250
David Lurie speaking.

01:15:17.375 --> 01:15:21.375
- Can we meet at the clinic
at 4:00?

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.875
- I'll be there.

01:16:45.375 --> 01:16:48.375
"She walks...

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.750
"in beauty...

01:16:50.875 --> 01:16:53.167
like the night."

01:16:54.667 --> 01:16:57.667
[engine turning]

01:17:11.667 --> 01:17:14.333
- Oh, I forgot.

01:17:14.458 --> 01:17:17.250
A Detective
Sergeant Esterhuyse rang.

01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:18.458
They found your car.

01:17:18.583 --> 01:17:20.208
- Oh, that's wonderful news.

01:17:20.333 --> 01:17:21.375
I'd given up.

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.917
Is it drivable?

01:17:24.042 --> 01:17:25.625
- Yes, he said
you can take it home.

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:28.833
- Oh, come on,
let's get out of here.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.833
Come on.

01:18:03.833 --> 01:18:05.667
Lighter color.

01:18:05.792 --> 01:18:06.833
- Okay.

01:18:06.958 --> 01:18:09.167
Thanks.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:17.750
[loud thud]

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:23.250
- It's all a mistake,
a waste of time.

01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:26.625
They have a Corolla,
but it's not mine.

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:28.333
And anyway,
even if they're caught

01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:30.042
and there's a trial,
would you testify?

01:18:30.167 --> 01:18:34.125
Are you ready for that?

01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:37.208
Lucy.

01:18:37.333 --> 01:18:40.708
It's time to face your choices.

01:18:40.833 --> 01:18:43.375
Can't we talk about it
rationally?

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:46.792
- I can't talk anymore, David.

01:18:46.917 --> 01:18:48.708
I just can't.

01:18:49.125 --> 01:18:51.875
I just can't.

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:14.542
- Lucy, lock the house.

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:16.625
Pay Petrus to look after things.

01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:18.708
Go to Holland;
see your mother.

01:19:18.833 --> 01:19:20.667
I'll pay for it.

01:19:22.417 --> 01:19:26.208
- If I go, I won't come back.

01:19:26.333 --> 01:19:29.042
- Is that such a bad thing?

01:19:29.167 --> 01:19:33.167
- There are some things
you just don't understand.

01:19:33.292 --> 01:19:34.333
Just don't understand.

01:19:34.458 --> 01:19:36.708
Don't pull over here.

01:19:36.833 --> 01:19:38.792
It's a bad stretch.

01:19:42.292 --> 01:19:46.292
- On the contrary,
I understand all too well.

01:19:47.875 --> 01:19:51.708
You were raped by three men...

01:19:51.833 --> 01:19:54.000
and I did nothing.

01:19:58.042 --> 01:19:59.500
- If they'd come
two weeks earlier,

01:19:59.625 --> 01:20:02.375
I would've been alone.

01:20:07.667 --> 01:20:09.833
They've done it before.

01:20:12.083 --> 01:20:14.458
They do rape.

01:20:15.458 --> 01:20:17.292
Stealing is a sideline.

01:20:19.375 --> 01:20:21.125
- Are you afraid
they're going to come back?

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.208
- I think they've marked me.

01:20:26.333 --> 01:20:28.500
- Then you can't possibly stay.

01:20:31.042 --> 01:20:34.833
- Maybe they see me
as owing something...

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:40.375
And they see themselves
as debt collectors.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:45.833
- Lucy, don't try and work out
how they see things.

01:20:48.208 --> 01:20:52.958
- Maybe hating a woman,
for a man,

01:20:53.083 --> 01:20:54.875
makes sex more exciting.

01:20:57.167 --> 01:20:59.542
When you trap a woman,

01:20:59.667 --> 01:21:03.333
hold her down...

01:21:08.958 --> 01:21:11.500
it must be a bit like killing.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.250
You're a man.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.833
You should know.

01:21:26.708 --> 01:21:28.792
- Perhaps...

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:31.625
sometimes...

01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:35.458
for some men.

01:21:57.125 --> 01:22:00.667
- I think you should
give her some room.

01:22:00.792 --> 01:22:05.542
Go back to Cape Town
for a while.

01:22:05.667 --> 01:22:08.500
Things have a way
of working themselves out.

01:22:13.708 --> 01:22:16.250
Everything will be all right.

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:02.208
[doorbell ringing]

01:23:02.333 --> 01:23:03.792
- Hello?

01:23:03.917 --> 01:23:06.083
- I'm looking for Mr. Isaacs.

01:23:06.208 --> 01:23:07.375
My name is Lurie.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.208
- He's not home yet.

01:23:09.333 --> 01:23:11.208
- When do you expect him home?

01:23:11.333 --> 01:23:13.875
- Any minute now.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
[gate unlocks]

01:23:30.208 --> 01:23:32.417
Hi, I'm Desiree.

01:23:32.542 --> 01:23:35.083
You can come wait inside
for him if you like.

01:24:02.083 --> 01:24:03.542
Where are you from?

01:24:03.667 --> 01:24:05.083
- Cape Town.

01:24:05.208 --> 01:24:08.833
- My sister's in Cape Town.
She's at the university.

01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:21.792
- I'm David Lurie.

01:24:21.917 --> 01:24:22.958
Do you remember me?

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.500
- Desiree, come.

01:24:37.167 --> 01:24:40.208
- So what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

01:24:40.333 --> 01:24:43.583
- You've heard Melanie's side
of the story.

01:24:43.708 --> 01:24:47.000
I would like to give you mine.

01:25:01.792 --> 01:25:05.208
It began without premeditation
on my part,

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:07.542
one of those
sudden little adventures

01:25:07.667 --> 01:25:09.292
that men of a certain kind have.

01:25:09.417 --> 01:25:12.125
Excuse me for talking this way.

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:15.042
I'm trying to be frank.

01:25:15.167 --> 01:25:20.167
However,
something unexpected happened.

01:25:20.292 --> 01:25:23.167
Melanie struck up a fire in me.

01:25:27.042 --> 01:25:30.667
- I ask myself, what on earth
you think you are up to

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:33.750
coming to my house
and telling me stories?

01:25:33.875 --> 01:25:35.500
- I'm sorry.

01:25:35.625 --> 01:25:38.000
It's outrageous, I know.

01:25:39.833 --> 01:25:42.250
How is Melanie?

01:25:42.375 --> 01:25:44.792
- Melanie's well.

01:25:44.917 --> 01:25:46.708
She's resumed her studies.

01:25:46.833 --> 01:25:48.208
She continues
with her theater work

01:25:48.333 --> 01:25:49.375
in her spare time.

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.792
So Melanie's all right.

01:25:57.167 --> 01:26:00.750
Is there something else you
wanted to tell me, Mr. Lurie?

01:26:04.042 --> 01:26:08.458
- I am truly sorry
for what I put your daughter

01:26:08.583 --> 01:26:10.917
and your family through.

01:26:13.667 --> 01:26:18.875
The grief I have caused
you and Mrs. Isaacs.

01:26:37.875 --> 01:26:42.917
- So at last
you have apologized.

01:26:43.042 --> 01:26:44.083
I say to myself,

01:26:44.208 --> 01:26:47.542
we are all sorry
when we are found out.

01:26:47.667 --> 01:26:49.875
But the question is,
what are you going to do

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.833
now that you are sorry?

01:26:55.333 --> 01:27:00.250
May I pronounce the word God?

01:27:00.375 --> 01:27:03.500
What does God want from you,
besides being very sorry?

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:11.833
Why do you think you are here,
Mr. Lurie?

01:27:11.958 --> 01:27:17.167
You were passing through George,
and you thought, "Why not?"

01:27:17.292 --> 01:27:19.667
- No, I came to George
to speak to you.

01:27:19.792 --> 01:27:22.792
- You are not hoping
that we are going to intervene

01:27:22.917 --> 01:27:25.250
on your behalf
with the university?

01:27:25.375 --> 01:27:26.417
Are you?

01:27:26.542 --> 01:27:28.167
- To intervene?

01:27:28.292 --> 01:27:31.292
- Because the path you are on,
Mr. Lurie,

01:27:31.417 --> 01:27:34.042
is one that God
has ordained for you.

01:27:34.167 --> 01:27:36.875
It is not for us to intervene.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.042
- No.

01:27:38.167 --> 01:27:41.083
I don't want you to intervene.

01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:40.333
I ask you all forgiveness.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
[loud thud]

01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:25.167
[plucking on banjo]

01:30:33.167 --> 01:30:35.417
[laughter]

01:30:35.542 --> 01:30:38.875
- Mm.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.917
And what have we here?

01:30:41.042 --> 01:30:44.375
A bit too much oomph.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.875
I suppose
you want it straightened?

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.875
- Could you do my hair
like Oprah's?

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.125
- Oh, she's not
asking for much, eh?

01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:52.625
I'll tell you what.

01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:55.083
I'm going to go mix up
some magical chemicals.

01:30:55.208 --> 01:30:57.167
Can I get you ladies
some coffee?

01:30:57.292 --> 01:30:59.125
- I'll have mine white, please.

01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:01.167
- I'll have mine black, please.

01:31:01.292 --> 01:31:03.167
- Well that's easy to remember.

01:31:11.042 --> 01:31:14.250
And one cappuccino coming up.

01:31:14.375 --> 01:31:16.016
- I've come for the job
you've advertised.

01:31:16.042 --> 01:31:17.458
- Lucky day.

01:31:17.583 --> 01:31:19.708
Well what are you
waiting for, girl?

01:31:19.833 --> 01:31:22.833
Pick up the broom
and make yourself useful.

01:31:43.875 --> 01:31:46.875
[screaming]

01:31:58.167 --> 01:32:02.375
- Jesus Christ, <i>jou dom meid!</i>

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:03.750
- Professor.

01:32:03.875 --> 01:32:06.208
- Oh, girls!

01:32:06.333 --> 01:32:08.417
We have until the end
of the month to pay the rent!

01:32:08.542 --> 01:32:10.500
Oh, that savage, savage Indian!

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:12.542
- What are we going to do,
Sydney?

01:32:12.667 --> 01:32:13.833
- Professor.

01:32:13.958 --> 01:32:15.042
- We're not going to panic.

01:32:15.167 --> 01:32:16.750
We are the cowboys.

01:32:16.875 --> 01:32:18.917
You know, I've got enough
chemicals back there

01:32:19.042 --> 01:32:21.333
to make an exploding
onion bhaji.

01:32:21.458 --> 01:32:23.958
And we can stick it
right up his...

01:32:24.083 --> 01:32:26.250
turban.

01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:29.458
- I've got a better idea.

01:32:29.583 --> 01:32:30.917
- Brilliant!
- Genius!

01:32:31.042 --> 01:32:32.583
The girl's a nutcracker.

01:32:40.208 --> 01:32:43.375
- Are you going to explain
this childish behavior?

01:32:44.708 --> 01:32:45.750
- [laughs]

01:32:45.875 --> 01:32:47.250
Haven't you learned your lesson?

01:32:47.375 --> 01:32:48.417
- What was my lesson?

01:32:48.542 --> 01:32:50.208
- Stick with your own kind.

01:32:50.333 --> 01:32:53.000
Melanie will spit in your eyes
if she sees you again.

01:32:53.125 --> 01:32:54.708
So keep away from her.

01:33:00.333 --> 01:33:03.417
Find yourself another life,
professor.

01:33:03.542 --> 01:33:06.542
[car alarm beeps]

01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:26.375
- Hi.
Hi, big boy.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.333
You looking for a good time?

01:33:28.458 --> 01:33:30.500
Hello?

01:33:30.625 --> 01:33:34.542
Oh, we have a grumpy one.

01:33:34.667 --> 01:33:36.000
Hi.

01:33:36.125 --> 01:33:37.375
Hello.

01:33:51.458 --> 01:33:54.458
- [moans]

01:34:02.458 --> 01:34:03.500
- Thank you.

01:34:03.625 --> 01:34:04.750
Good night.

01:34:04.875 --> 01:34:07.083
- Good night.

01:34:20.167 --> 01:34:21.417
- Are you okay?

01:34:21.542 --> 01:34:22.583
- I'm fine.

01:34:22.708 --> 01:34:25.042
I'm very busy.

01:34:27.167 --> 01:34:29.292
Ring me anytime.

01:34:29.417 --> 01:34:31.750
I miss you, Lucy.

01:34:31.875 --> 01:34:33.375
- Good night.

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:34.625
- Good night.

01:35:32.125 --> 01:35:34.417
- Why are you going to Durban?

01:35:34.542 --> 01:35:37.000
Are you applying
for a job there?

01:35:39.917 --> 01:35:41.167
- I lied.

01:35:41.292 --> 01:35:44.292
I wanted to see
if you were all right.

01:35:44.417 --> 01:35:45.500
I miss you.

01:35:46.958 --> 01:35:48.000
- I'm pregnant.

01:35:48.125 --> 01:35:49.375
- You're what?

01:35:50.667 --> 01:35:52.125
- I'm pregnant.

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:56.375
- From that day?

01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:58.542
- From that day.

01:35:58.667 --> 01:36:01.292
- But I thought you said
you'd taken care of it

01:36:01.417 --> 01:36:02.542
with that woman GP.

01:36:02.667 --> 01:36:05.333
- I'm not having an abortion.

01:36:05.458 --> 01:36:09.333
- Are you telling me
you're going to have the child?

01:36:09.458 --> 01:36:10.500
- Yes.

01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:14.042
- A child from one of those men?

01:36:14.167 --> 01:36:15.625
- Yes.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.167
- But why, Lucy?

01:36:20.333 --> 01:36:22.875
- I'm a woman, David.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.125
Do you think I hate children?

01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:28.333
Must I choose against a child
because of who the father is?

01:36:30.167 --> 01:36:31.792
- And your mind's made up?

01:36:34.458 --> 01:36:35.958
- Yes.

01:36:38.292 --> 01:36:41.708
- Very well.

01:36:41.833 --> 01:36:44.833
I'll stand by you
no matter what.

01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:54.250
I'm going for a walk.

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:14.292
[sobbing]

01:37:39.083 --> 01:37:41.083
- By the way, the boy's back.

01:37:41.208 --> 01:37:43.375
- The boy?

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:46.875
- The boy you had a row with
at Petrus' party.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.208
He's staying with Petrus,

01:37:49.333 --> 01:37:51.333
helps him out.

01:37:51.458 --> 01:37:54.333
His name is Pollux.

01:37:56.667 --> 01:38:01.875
Anyway, he turns out to be
the brother of Petrus' wife.

01:38:06.583 --> 01:38:09.667
- So, Pollux returns
to the scene of the crime,

01:38:09.792 --> 01:38:13.333
and we must all behave
as if nothing's happened.

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:19.000
- I want you
to stay clear of him.

01:38:19.125 --> 01:38:20.875
I suspect there's something
wrong with him,

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.520
but I can't order him
off the property.

01:38:22.625 --> 01:38:23.667
It's not in my power.

01:38:23.792 --> 01:38:25.833
- Particularly--
- Particularly what?

01:38:25.958 --> 01:38:28.375
- Particularly
when he may be the father

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:31.000
of the child you are carrying.

01:39:01.333 --> 01:39:03.125
I'm looking for Petrus.

01:39:37.667 --> 01:39:39.417
- Ah, David.

01:39:39.542 --> 01:39:40.875
You are back.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.125
How was Cape Town?

01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:43.417
- Good, good.

01:39:43.542 --> 01:39:47.208
Lucy tells me the boy
is back, Pollux.

01:39:47.333 --> 01:39:49.833
- He is my relative.

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:52.833
- You told me
you didn't know him.

01:39:52.958 --> 01:39:56.458
You lied to me.

01:39:56.583 --> 01:39:59.417
- You come
look after your child.

01:39:59.542 --> 01:40:01.333
I also look after my child.

01:40:01.458 --> 01:40:02.833
- Your child?

01:40:02.958 --> 01:40:04.042
So now he's your child?

01:40:04.167 --> 01:40:07.708
- Yes, he is a child.

01:40:07.833 --> 01:40:10.083
He is my family, my people.

01:40:10.208 --> 01:40:11.875
You say it is bad,
what happened.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.625
I also say it is bad.

01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:15.958
But now it is finished.

01:40:16.083 --> 01:40:17.333
- It's not finished.

01:40:17.458 --> 01:40:21.375
It will go on long after
I'm dead and you're dead.

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:24.208
- He will marry Lucy.

01:40:24.333 --> 01:40:28.708
But he is too young,
too young to marry.

01:40:28.833 --> 01:40:29.875
He is a child.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.583
- A dangerous child, a jackal.

01:40:32.708 --> 01:40:35.875
- Yes, too young to marry.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.208
Maybe one day he can marry,
but not now.

01:40:40.333 --> 01:40:42.542
I will marry.

01:40:47.917 --> 01:40:50.292
- You will marry whom?

01:40:50.417 --> 01:40:53.000
- I will marry Lucy.

01:40:57.333 --> 01:40:59.375
- Lucy, this is preposterous.

01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:02.042
- He's not offering
a church wedding.

01:41:02.167 --> 01:41:04.417
He's offering an alliance,
a deal.

01:41:04.542 --> 01:41:07.125
I contribute the land,
and in return,

01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:08.833
I'm allowed to creep in
under his wing.

01:41:08.958 --> 01:41:10.917
Otherwise,
I'm without protection.

01:41:11.042 --> 01:41:12.542
- What about the personal side?

01:41:12.667 --> 01:41:14.667
- I don't think Petrus
wants to sleep with me.

01:41:14.792 --> 01:41:16.708
- And you?
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:41:16.833 --> 01:41:18.875
- Good, then I will go
and tell him

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.375
that we refuse his offer.

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:22.542
- Wait.

01:41:27.667 --> 01:41:29.667
Say I accept his protection.

01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:32.375
If he wants me to be known
as his wife, so be it.

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:34.958
But then the child
becomes his too,

01:41:35.083 --> 01:41:36.667
part of his family.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.750
As for the land, say I will sign
the land over to him.

01:41:41.875 --> 01:41:44.667
But the house remains mine.

01:41:44.792 --> 01:41:47.417
I'll become a tenant
on his land.

01:41:51.458 --> 01:41:53.393
No one is to enter the house
without my permission,

01:41:53.417 --> 01:41:55.875
including him.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.500
And I keep the kennels.

01:41:57.625 --> 01:41:59.500
- Lucy, it's not workable.

01:41:59.625 --> 01:42:03.167
- I'm not leaving, David.

01:42:07.042 --> 01:42:09.500
Go and tell Petrus
what I have said.

01:42:27.125 --> 01:42:30.083
- How humiliating
