00:02.969 --> 00:04.601
Previously on "Alias"...

00:04.602 --> 00:07.102
Jack Bristow,
this is Ariana Kane.

00:07.136 --> 00:10.431
Ms. Kane is the head of Alliance
counterintelligence.

00:10.535 --> 00:12.634
She's here to investigate
the events

00:12.635 --> 00:15.102
leading up to my wife,
Emily's, disappearance

00:15.103 --> 00:17.933
and the subsequent attempts
to blackmail me.

00:18.069 --> 00:20.235
If Sloane gets ahold
of that terminal,

00:20.236 --> 00:22.502
The Alliance will be able to
eavesdrop on corporations,

00:22.503 --> 00:24.203
law enforcement,
political campaigns.

00:24.204 --> 00:27.465
The potential for blackmail
and insider trading

00:27.570 --> 00:28.836
would be unlimited.

00:28.837 --> 00:30.670
Gerard Cuvee...

00:30.671 --> 00:33.330
former leader of The
People's Revolutionary Front.

00:33.437 --> 00:36.994
One of Cuvee's men placed a call
to a data storage facility.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.900
It's likely Cuvee duplicated
the Echelon software

00:40.005 --> 00:42.505
and had them stored
in a secure server there.

00:42.604 --> 00:45.229
Sydney,
you're going in with Marshall.

00:45.338 --> 00:47.604
You're the only one qualified
to hack the server

00:47.605 --> 00:49.437
without an electronic device.

00:49.438 --> 00:51.771
Marshall has
a photographic memory.

00:51.772 --> 00:54.670
Once the files flash across
the screen, he'll remember them.

00:54.772 --> 00:56.938
I can't just give SD-6
a fake Marshall.

00:56.939 --> 00:58.871
No.

00:58.872 --> 01:02.032
But we can pull him out of SD-6.

01:02.139 --> 01:03.904
Mom, I'll be home
in a little while.

01:03.905 --> 01:07.200
Just getting back from
my big business trip in London.

01:11.306 --> 01:14.170
What do you mean
we didn't pick up Marshall?

01:14.273 --> 01:17.000
Please don't hurt me. Please.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.307 --> 01:28.439
Some people think
there's a conspiracy.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.962
That the government
eavesdrops on everyone.

01:31.108 --> 01:32.773
It's no conspiracy.

01:32.774 --> 01:33.640
Right now,

01:33.641 --> 01:36.334
satellites and ground station
antennas are listening in.

01:36.441 --> 01:38.774
Faxes, Internet communications,
phone calls.

01:38.775 --> 01:41.969
All routed to voice and
optical recognition computers.

01:42.075 --> 01:44.507
They can analyze words
spoken and written

01:44.508 --> 01:46.475
in every common language
on Earth.

01:46.476 --> 01:48.341
The system's called Echelon.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.341
Yeah, I heard about Echelon.

01:50.342 --> 01:53.137
I just don't understand
how it's legal.

01:53.242 --> 01:56.208
It's a computer that listens to
and reads everything?

01:56.309 --> 01:58.009
Looking for key words.

01:58.010 --> 02:01.407
The system scans 2 million
conversations an hour.

02:01.509 --> 02:04.031
Yeah, while shamelessly
violating the Constitution.

02:04.176 --> 02:06.576
The National Security Agency
argues

02:06.577 --> 02:09.077
it's one of its
most important weapons.

02:09.143 --> 02:11.870
And that they don't abuse
the system.

02:11.977 --> 02:14.210
Somehow, that's unreassuring.

02:14.211 --> 02:16.768
Well, there's this man
named Gerard Cuvee

02:16.877 --> 02:19.210
who figured out
how to hack into Echelon.

02:19.211 --> 02:22.006
He was able to pick up
secure military communications.

02:22.111 --> 02:24.941
Because of that, he was
able to locate and destroy

02:25.044 --> 02:27.443
a U.S. military lab in Dresden.

02:27.444 --> 02:31.035
In London, we shut down
Cuvee's access to Echelon.

02:31.178 --> 02:35.440
And, thank God,
kept it away from SD-6.

02:35.545 --> 02:38.045
So you get Echelon,
you become Big Brother.

02:38.078 --> 02:40.511
The best thing
about this mission.

02:40.512 --> 02:44.501
This guy that I work with,
this sweetheart, Marshall,

02:44.612 --> 02:48.874
was pulled out of SD-6 and taken
into protective custody.

02:48.979 --> 02:51.570
The CIA's gonna give him a life.

02:53.213 --> 02:55.713
A real life.

02:56.313 --> 02:59.676
I can't tell you what a relief
it is knowing he's safe.

03:08.381 --> 03:12.609
You took something
that doesn't belong to you.

03:12.714 --> 03:15.373
My employer would like it back.

03:29.849 --> 03:32.542
No! Please! No! No!

03:39.449 --> 03:43.813
Epoxy is a binary compound.

03:43.916 --> 03:46.541
You have just ingested
the resin.

03:46.649 --> 03:49.910
Alone, it's not toxic.

03:50.017 --> 03:55.847
But in combination
with a hardener...

03:55.950 --> 04:02.179
the epoxy cures,
passing from a liquid state...

04:03.417 --> 04:05.917
...through a gel state...

04:07.951 --> 04:11.439
...to a solid state.

04:13.785 --> 04:20.048
This transformation will
puncture your vital organs.

04:20.152 --> 04:25.312
Block your windpipe,
causing you to suffocate.

04:27.219 --> 04:30.810
So let's start over.

04:30.919 --> 04:35.283
The Echelon operating system.
Where is it?

04:39.153 --> 04:42.846
# She was the only light
I knew #

04:42.953 --> 04:46.010
# She was the real #

04:48.320 --> 04:50.486
What?

04:50.487 --> 04:53.214
I have a crush on a guy at work.

04:53.321 --> 04:55.980
Really?
Who is he?

04:56.087 --> 04:58.186
Someone in my department.

04:58.187 --> 05:00.487
We've worked together
for about a year.

05:00.488 --> 05:02.153
You're kidding me.

05:02.154 --> 05:04.654
What's his name?

05:05.888 --> 05:08.353
Michael.

05:08.354 --> 05:10.854
And he's...

05:12.721 --> 05:15.187
I don't know
how to describe him.

05:15.188 --> 05:19.245
He's smart.
And he's funny.

05:19.389 --> 05:21.588
He's so cute.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.554
Hot cute.
Not goofy cute.

05:23.555 --> 05:26.055
Hot cute.

05:26.756 --> 05:29.916
So why haven't I met this guy?

05:30.023 --> 05:31.188
He has a girlfriend.

05:31.189 --> 05:32.322
Of course he does.

05:32.323 --> 05:34.188
Which is ultimately irrelevant.

05:34.189 --> 05:37.814
The bank has a policy
against coworkers dating.

05:37.923 --> 05:39.822
You know, you could quit.

05:39.823 --> 05:42.189
I don't know what kind
of a hold the bank...

05:42.190 --> 05:44.690
I just can't quit my job.

05:44.757 --> 05:48.382
I haven't heard you talk
like this in forever.

05:48.491 --> 05:50.991
No one in the free world works
as hard as you.

05:51.090 --> 05:53.590
I know it seems that way.

05:53.591 --> 05:56.523
Maybe you and Michael
are destined.

05:56.624 --> 05:59.124
Maybe he can quit.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.958
I got to go.

06:06.458 --> 06:07.624
What's wrong?

06:07.625 --> 06:09.091
Marshall was abducted.

06:09.092 --> 06:09.891
What?

06:09.892 --> 06:13.017
- Our plan was to intercept him.
- I know what our plan was.

06:13.126 --> 06:16.523
The extraction team was about to
move in when they saw this.

06:17.693 --> 06:20.025
We ran the plates
on one of the SUV's.

06:20.026 --> 06:21.925
It was rented
by Charles Williamson.

06:21.926 --> 06:25.688
We put his photo I.D. through
a facial recognition database.

06:25.826 --> 06:29.690
It matched a known associate
of Gerard Cuvee.

06:29.793 --> 06:31.792
What steps are being taken?

06:31.793 --> 06:34.850
CIA's got one team radiating out
from the abduction point,

06:34.960 --> 06:36.926
another in London
retracing his steps.

06:36.927 --> 06:39.791
Our steps.
The mission in London was my op.

06:39.894 --> 06:41.826
Marshall was my responsibility.

06:41.827 --> 06:45.088
Before being captured,
Marshall e-mailed Cuvee's copy

06:45.194 --> 06:47.494
of the Echelon access program
to SD-6.

06:47.495 --> 06:50.689
We took away Cuvee's access
to Echelon and gave it to SD-6?

06:50.795 --> 06:53.488
Yes, but when SD-6
downloaded the program,

06:53.595 --> 06:55.861
they discovered a problem.

06:55.862 --> 06:59.123
Marshall's e-mail was broken up
into packets of data

06:59.262 --> 07:00.660
and routed to SD-6

07:00.661 --> 07:04.058
via Internet service providers
around the world.

07:04.162 --> 07:06.061
However, there was
a malfunction.

07:06.062 --> 07:09.721
And several data packets
were not transmitted.

07:09.829 --> 07:12.989
Without them,
we cannot access Echelon.

07:13.096 --> 07:15.195
Can we fill in
the missing pieces?

07:15.196 --> 07:18.491
It would take six months.
Even then, there's no guarantee.

07:18.597 --> 07:20.195
Do we know
where the error occurred?

07:20.196 --> 07:23.684
A government-operated facility
in Ho Chi Minh City.

07:23.797 --> 07:26.695
I'm sending in Sydney and Dixon
to retrieve them.

07:26.797 --> 07:29.297
Who's leading the team
to recover Marshall?

07:31.764 --> 07:34.958
We've changed his access codes.

07:35.097 --> 07:37.330
There is nothing
Marshall can tell Cuvee

07:37.331 --> 07:39.163
that could possibly hurt us.

07:39.164 --> 07:42.289
He will be tortured.
Most likely killed.

07:42.398 --> 07:45.364
Oh, yes.
I'm sure he will be.

07:45.464 --> 07:48.055
I've already contacted SD-4.

07:48.165 --> 07:51.961
There'll be a replacement
in Op Tech by morning.

07:52.065 --> 07:54.565
That was the extent
of his concern.

07:54.632 --> 07:57.462
It was as if someone
had overcooked his steak.

07:57.565 --> 07:59.398
You know what Cuvee's gonna do.

07:59.399 --> 08:02.160
He's gonna try to get Marshall
to reverse-engineer the software

08:02.266 --> 08:03.498
and get back on-line.

08:03.499 --> 08:05.432
But you need two things
to get on Echelon.

08:05.433 --> 08:07.831
The software
and an access point.

08:07.832 --> 08:08.898
Software is like a map.

08:08.899 --> 08:11.032
It leads you to the doorway
of the system.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.760
The access point is the door.
Most likely a satellite.

08:13.867 --> 08:16.697
If we can find the door Cuvee
went through and lock it,

08:16.800 --> 08:19.066
he won't get on,
not even with Marshall's help.

08:19.067 --> 08:22.261
Diagnostics has run a
comprehensive systems analysis.

08:22.367 --> 08:23.766
They can't find the breach.

08:23.767 --> 08:26.756
Your mother thinks Cuvee
may have used a Russian network.

08:26.868 --> 08:28.867
Their version of Echelon,
called Swarm.

08:28.868 --> 08:30.199
She told you that?

08:30.200 --> 08:31.867
I spoke with her.

08:31.868 --> 08:36.527
She thinks she can find the
back door. But she has terms.

08:36.634 --> 08:39.657
If you want to know where Cuvee
breached, it'll take time.

08:39.801 --> 08:43.255
But I could do it if I were
given access to Echelon.

08:43.402 --> 08:44.567
No restrictions.

08:44.568 --> 08:47.363
Kendall will never give that
to you.

08:47.468 --> 08:51.093
Then I would simply ask you
to inform Mr. Kendall

08:51.202 --> 08:53.963
that the technicians
he'll assign to do the job

08:54.069 --> 08:57.035
will discover it is like
quicksand.

08:57.136 --> 09:00.000
Your father was correct.
I declined the offer.

09:00.102 --> 09:03.397
Second only to Arvin Sloane,
Irina Derevko is the last person

09:03.503 --> 09:06.025
I want having access to the U.S.
government secure network.

09:06.137 --> 09:07.635
She'd be watched.

09:07.636 --> 09:10.796
If she tried anything unusual,
we could shut the system down.

09:10.936 --> 09:13.663
Access to computers
and telecommunications equipment

09:13.804 --> 09:16.463
is prohibited by your mother's
immunity agreement.

09:16.604 --> 09:18.836
I think
we might be wasting time.

09:18.837 --> 09:20.903
We hire qualified technicians.

09:20.904 --> 09:22.903
What do you say
we give them a shot?

09:22.904 --> 09:24.970
Your countermission is simple.

09:24.971 --> 09:28.062
You'll download the data packets
SD-6 is looking for

09:28.171 --> 09:29.704
and switch it with this.

09:29.705 --> 09:31.270
It's corrupted data.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.804
We'll have what SD-6 needs.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.138
They'll never be able
to access Echelon.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.639
And, Syd, we'll find Marshall.

09:44.339 --> 09:47.237
I will ask you one more time.

09:47.339 --> 09:50.998
Where is the Echelon software
you took from us?

09:51.106 --> 09:54.868
I swear on my mother's grave,
I don't know.

09:56.173 --> 09:58.866
And though, technically,
Mom's still alive,

09:58.973 --> 10:00.806
she has picked out
her gravesite.

10:00.807 --> 10:04.933
Refusal to cooperate
has a price.

10:05.041 --> 10:07.539
No, no, no, no, no.

10:10.807 --> 10:13.307
We can find your mother.

10:16.674 --> 10:19.868
Okay. Okay.

10:22.741 --> 10:25.241
I sent the Echelon software
to SD-6.

10:25.342 --> 10:27.842
There's nothing I can do
about that. I swear.

10:27.908 --> 10:31.305
But I saw the code.
All of it.

10:31.409 --> 10:35.136
And I have a photographic
memory, so I can re-create it.

10:35.242 --> 10:36.508
I can rewrite it.

10:36.509 --> 10:39.475
Just don't hurt my mother.

10:39.575 --> 10:41.075
Please.

10:41.076 --> 10:43.633
You leave my mother alone.

10:44.576 --> 10:47.201
We're off to a very good start.

11:02.910 --> 11:04.109
What are you doing?

11:04.110 --> 11:06.176
Downgrading
your network privileges.

11:06.177 --> 11:07.877
Pending the outcome
of my investigation,

11:07.878 --> 11:10.343
your security clearance
has been revoked.

11:10.344 --> 11:11.910
Get out of my office.

11:11.911 --> 11:14.604
When Emily was killed,
you claim you were in Taipei.

11:14.711 --> 11:16.077
It is a fact, not a claim.

11:16.078 --> 11:19.874
When a blackmailer stole $100
million of The Alliance's money

11:19.978 --> 11:22.045
in exchange for pictures,
you were...

11:22.046 --> 11:23.210
On assignment.

11:23.211 --> 11:27.609
Doing back-channel, unsupervised
work you arranged for yourself.

11:27.712 --> 11:29.778
I am a senior officer
with discretion

11:29.779 --> 11:33.302
to arrange and carry out
assignments as I see fit.

11:33.446 --> 11:35.045
I will not be subject
to a witch-hunt!

11:35.046 --> 11:37.311
You have no protections here.

11:37.312 --> 11:40.073
No civil rights
or civil liberties

11:40.180 --> 11:42.478
or reasonable doubt.

11:42.479 --> 11:44.545
See that I'm not disturbed
again.

11:44.546 --> 11:47.046
Yes, ma'am.

12:04.348 --> 12:06.680
Get everyone you can
from Op Tech now.

12:06.681 --> 12:09.442
Notify assets in Istanbul,
Taipei, and Azerbaijan.

12:09.548 --> 12:12.105
We will need assistance
in forging hard evidence

12:12.215 --> 12:16.011
of my being in those locations
on specific days and times.

12:16.115 --> 12:17.781
We have a situation.

12:17.782 --> 12:20.282
Ariana Kane, head of
Alliance counterintelligence.

12:20.382 --> 12:21.681
She's investigating me

12:21.682 --> 12:23.681
in connection with
the murder of Emily Sloane.

12:23.682 --> 12:26.546
She's checking the places
you've been? You're covered.

12:26.649 --> 12:29.944
Yes. Enough to withstand
a cursory inquiry.

12:30.050 --> 12:33.175
This is anything but cursory.

12:33.316 --> 12:35.115
I did not kill Emily Sloane.

12:35.116 --> 12:37.315
But I do have secrets.

12:37.316 --> 12:40.248
The last thing I can afford, the
last thing Sydney can afford,

12:40.350 --> 12:44.907
is someone discovering that my
loyalty does not lie with SD-6.

13:15.485 --> 13:17.985
We've got the prints
for Istanbul.

13:17.986 --> 13:20.952
This goes with the car
you rented in Taipei.

13:21.053 --> 13:23.746
We backdated phony charges
through my credit card?

13:23.852 --> 13:25.886
Restaurants,
car agencies, hotels.

13:25.887 --> 13:29.047
Room charges.
They'll be on file by morning.

13:29.153 --> 13:31.653
Good.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.186
Bad time?

13:33.187 --> 13:34.685
- Yeah.
- What else is new?

13:34.686 --> 13:36.353
You left word with Analysis.

13:36.354 --> 13:39.149
When Tippin's profile came back,
you wanted to be informed.

13:39.287 --> 13:40.852
Anything I should know?

13:40.853 --> 13:42.720
Just run protocol
and bring him in.

13:42.721 --> 13:43.720
You got it.

13:43.721 --> 13:45.787
What about surveillance?

13:45.788 --> 13:48.583
We thought about rotoscoping you
out of surveillance.

13:48.687 --> 13:52.483
But if they slow down the rate,
they'd know it was altered.

13:52.588 --> 13:54.120
This is the original feed

13:54.121 --> 13:56.120
from the Istanbul
Intercontinental.

13:56.121 --> 13:59.315
This is the footage
that we filmed earlier.

13:59.422 --> 14:03.149
Use some subpixel masking,
and we get...

14:03.256 --> 14:04.387
Look.

14:04.388 --> 14:06.788
I even gave you a shadow.

14:06.789 --> 14:09.778
We've got your fingerprints
on rent-a-car keys.

14:09.889 --> 14:12.946
- Hair stitched into pillowcases.
- I want to review everything.

14:13.089 --> 14:15.953
- I think you're good.
- Thinking isn't sufficient.

14:16.057 --> 14:18.557
I want to see the plane tickets.

14:34.724 --> 14:37.057
Nina Bales
from Tech Sky Industries.

14:37.058 --> 14:39.390
I'm here to see Mr. Nguyen.

14:39.391 --> 14:42.845
Accessing the system now.

14:42.957 --> 14:46.184
I should be in mid-presentation.

14:46.324 --> 14:48.846
Thank you for giving Tech Sky
the opportunity to talk

14:48.992 --> 14:51.158
about our microsatellite
technology.

14:57.559 --> 14:59.658
At your direction,
the projector will emit

14:59.659 --> 15:01.792
a high-intensity
pulse strobe light

15:01.793 --> 15:04.850
that flashes at the same
frequency as human brain waves,

15:04.959 --> 15:07.459
effectively rendering
the targets unconscious.

15:07.526 --> 15:10.855
I can get the data packets
and return and they won't know?

15:10.959 --> 15:13.550
For three minutes, they'll
experience it like a daydream.

15:13.660 --> 15:16.092
Any longer,
they'll regain consciousness

15:16.093 --> 15:17.759
and you'll be found out.

15:17.760 --> 15:21.055
Make sure you put
these glasses on first.

15:21.194 --> 15:24.058
They're time-synchronized
with the pulses.

15:24.161 --> 15:27.558
A small constellation
of satellites in low Earth orbit

15:27.660 --> 15:29.527
is cheaper to launch
and maintain

15:29.528 --> 15:31.693
than a traditional
satellite network.

15:31.694 --> 15:33.326
And if one micro sat fails,

15:33.327 --> 15:35.849
the entire system
need not be replaced.

15:35.961 --> 15:39.791
What you're looking at
is a typical Tech Sky package.

15:41.495 --> 15:44.256
Okay, Syd, do your thing.
I'm almost in.

15:50.062 --> 15:52.562
Okay, Syd, I'm in.

15:57.662 --> 15:58.895
Lan Nguyen.

15:58.896 --> 16:00.429
- Is that right?
- Right.

16:00.430 --> 16:04.419
His I.D. will give you access
to any room in the ministry.

16:09.396 --> 16:12.590
The data packets are in the
hard drive in the server room.

16:12.696 --> 16:15.196
Room 206.
You've got three minutes.

16:26.864 --> 16:29.989
Syd, you've got two minutes
to find the right hard drive.

16:32.798 --> 16:34.764
I'm not getting
a positive signal.

16:34.765 --> 16:37.265
Data packets aren't
on drives 1 or 2.

16:37.365 --> 16:38.597
Drive 3 is missing.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.597
Is there a serial number
in the third bay?

16:40.598 --> 16:43.689
657-33P-Y12.

16:43.799 --> 16:45.565
That drive is in for repairs.

16:45.566 --> 16:47.764
Where?

16:47.765 --> 16:50.265
Level 1.
Room 147.

16:50.266 --> 16:51.698
- I'm on my way.
- No.

16:51.699 --> 16:53.732
The repair room
is just off the lobby.

16:53.733 --> 16:55.732
I'll go.
Meet me at the extraction point.

16:55.733 --> 16:58.290
Dixon, no.
I'll make it.

17:00.033 --> 17:01.366
Robert Milton.

17:01.367 --> 17:04.560
I'm here for the Tech Sky
presentation.

17:04.666 --> 17:06.031
One moment, please.

17:06.032 --> 17:09.362
Yeah, I'm so late already,
my boss is gonna kill me.

17:33.169 --> 17:34.601
I told you I could make it.

17:34.602 --> 17:37.102
Start over there.
Work toward me.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.202
Got it.

17:53.737 --> 17:55.436
Okay.

17:55.437 --> 17:57.937
Let's get out of here.

17:59.770 --> 18:00.436
Sydney!

18:00.437 --> 18:02.937
The guards will be here
any minute.

18:12.971 --> 18:15.493
This is a great victory.

18:15.604 --> 18:18.104
You both should be very proud.

18:20.338 --> 18:21.837
Thank you, sir.

18:21.838 --> 18:24.702
But our thoughts
are with Marshall.

18:24.806 --> 18:26.571
Has there been any word?

18:26.572 --> 18:28.271
No, I'm afraid not.

18:28.272 --> 18:30.538
But our efforts continue.

18:30.539 --> 18:33.039
As do our prayers.

18:37.373 --> 18:41.567
So now SD-6 has everything
it needs to access Echelon.

18:41.706 --> 18:43.772
Any idea how long
before it's running?

18:43.773 --> 18:46.273
Midnight tomorrow at the latest.

18:46.406 --> 18:49.600
You should have seen the look
on Sloane's face.

18:49.706 --> 18:52.831
I don't think I've ever seen him
so happy about a mission.

18:54.441 --> 18:58.373
He said he was praying
for Marshall.

18:58.474 --> 19:01.167
Listen.
About Marshall.

19:02.075 --> 19:05.700
One of our teams traced Cuvee's
unit that abducted Marshall

19:05.808 --> 19:08.308
to a safe house outside London.

19:10.408 --> 19:14.840
But by the time they got there,
it was abandoned.

19:16.642 --> 19:19.142
It was wired with four pounds
of C-4.

19:21.608 --> 19:24.108
We never had a chance.

19:28.076 --> 19:29.608
And it gets worse.

19:29.609 --> 19:32.109
In light of the tragedy,
the director ordered a halt

19:32.209 --> 19:33.542
in the search.

19:33.543 --> 19:36.236
So for the moment,
Marshall's on his own.

19:40.210 --> 19:43.664
You think maybe he could
point that somewhere else?

19:50.744 --> 19:52.976
All right.
Never mind.

19:52.977 --> 19:55.477
It's not...
It's...

19:58.411 --> 20:01.571
You know Sydney's sleeping off
another business trip.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.844
Yeah.
Dublin, I think.

20:03.845 --> 20:05.477
Glasgow.

20:05.478 --> 20:07.510
Two more, I set a world record.

20:07.511 --> 20:09.710
Will, I'm serious.

20:09.711 --> 20:12.836
Last week, it was Buenos Aires.
Before, it was Tokyo.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.611
I mean, it never ends.

20:14.612 --> 20:17.578
Fran, you know how much
that used to bug me, right?

20:17.679 --> 20:20.179
I mean, I complained
about it constantly.

20:20.245 --> 20:25.143
But her job, what she does,
it's important to her.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.212
I don't care.
I am still worried about her.

20:28.346 --> 20:31.971
Ever since Danny died,
all she does is work.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.079
Oh, but now there's
this new guy.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.013
You should have heard her
talking.

20:36.014 --> 20:38.775
She sounded so happy.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.380
She told you about a guy?

20:40.381 --> 20:43.370
Yeah. Somebody from work.
Michael something.

20:43.481 --> 20:44.680
You know him?

20:44.681 --> 20:45.680
No.

20:45.681 --> 20:48.738
Of course not,
because the jerks at the bank

20:48.848 --> 20:51.280
won't let them date
because it's against the rules.

20:51.281 --> 20:52.480
They're not dating?

20:52.481 --> 20:54.547
No, no.
He's dating somebody else.

20:54.548 --> 20:56.814
She's just pining.

20:56.815 --> 20:58.314
Oh, you know what?

20:58.315 --> 21:00.872
The mailman left this for you.

21:00.981 --> 21:03.606
Guess there's a package for you
at the post office.

21:08.982 --> 21:11.482
Hey, Will.

21:11.916 --> 21:13.815
I got your psych report back.

21:13.816 --> 21:14.881
You did well.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.348
I'm not a sociopath?

21:16.349 --> 21:17.915
Well, I didn't say that.

21:17.916 --> 21:19.348
Do I have a job?

21:19.349 --> 21:20.582
Yes.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.182
- A paying job.
- Yes.

21:22.183 --> 21:23.549
As an analyst.

21:23.550 --> 21:26.277
You'll review classified
documents and file reports.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.450
Think of it as writing articles,

21:28.451 --> 21:30.483
only your source material
is classified.

21:30.484 --> 21:32.783
In fact, your cover is
as a journalist.

21:32.784 --> 21:35.249
What does that mean?
Am I an agent?

21:35.250 --> 21:36.416
What?

21:36.417 --> 21:38.716
Agents are field-trained.
You're desk-trained.

21:38.717 --> 21:40.550
- You sit at a desk.
- That's cool.

21:40.551 --> 21:43.608
The agency operates a monthly
magazine called "Trade Roads. "

21:43.717 --> 21:46.683
There's a small L.A. office.
Go there when we page you.

21:46.784 --> 21:49.511
The materials we'll need
analyzed will be there.

21:49.618 --> 21:52.584
But don't remove them
from the building.

21:52.685 --> 21:57.743
When you're done filling out the
paperwork, just give it to Bill.

21:57.852 --> 22:00.352
I get health insurance?

22:00.919 --> 22:03.419
Welcome to the CIA.

22:04.286 --> 22:06.752
Thank you.

22:06.753 --> 22:08.552
Listen.

22:08.553 --> 22:10.251
Obviously, you're a good guy.

22:10.252 --> 22:13.649
And I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this job.

22:13.753 --> 22:16.253
And what I'm gonna say
is inappropriate.

22:18.253 --> 22:20.753
But Sydney cares about you.

22:21.087 --> 22:24.484
And what you guys have
or don't have

22:24.587 --> 22:27.087
means a great deal to her.

22:28.454 --> 22:30.954
I want to make sure
you respect that.

22:52.255 --> 22:55.016
I just got off the phone
with the director again.

22:55.122 --> 22:59.214
He asked again if I knew we were
in the intelligence business.

22:59.322 --> 23:01.655
SD-6 is, by our best estimates,

23:01.656 --> 23:04.178
less than 12 hours from
accessing Echelon, which would

23:04.290 --> 23:07.722
give them all the intelligence
capabilities of the CIA.

23:07.823 --> 23:10.812
Our efforts to prevent Gerard
Cuvee from reaccessing Echelon

23:10.957 --> 23:13.684
ended in tragedy.
Four agents killed.

23:13.790 --> 23:14.956
As far as we know,

23:14.957 --> 23:18.082
your SD-6 Tech Ops officer
Marshall Flinkman

23:18.191 --> 23:21.282
could already have Cuvee
up and running again.

23:23.558 --> 23:26.853
As for Derevko's intel on Swarm,
Info Sec has been unsuccessful

23:26.958 --> 23:29.617
in their search
for a back-door access point.

23:41.058 --> 23:43.751
- What just happened?
- I had to shut down the system.

23:43.892 --> 23:47.449
Swarm detected I was mapping its
network and spit out a virus.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.624
My mother knew
this would happen.

23:49.625 --> 23:52.025
That's the word she used.
Quicksand.

23:52.026 --> 23:53.492
She might have set up the virus.

23:53.493 --> 23:56.084
Why keep her here
if you're not gonna use her?

23:56.193 --> 23:57.992
You said Derevko
turned herself in

23:57.993 --> 24:00.493
as part of something
we can't see.

24:00.526 --> 24:03.390
Giving her access to Echelon
could only help that.

24:03.493 --> 24:06.687
In this instance,
I think she could be an asset.

24:09.893 --> 24:12.393
They found it.
Quicksand.

24:12.394 --> 24:14.560
I told your father my terms.

24:14.561 --> 24:17.061
Full access to the network.
No restrictions.

24:17.195 --> 24:21.752
Dad fought for you on this.
Don't make him regret it.

25:09.730 --> 25:12.230
I'll need to send
an access code.

25:13.098 --> 25:16.292
How will we know you're not
signaling your organization?

25:16.398 --> 25:18.898
You won't.

25:23.798 --> 25:26.298
Do it.

25:38.166 --> 25:39.832
Looks clean.

25:39.833 --> 25:42.333
slow it down 200%.

25:45.166 --> 25:46.965
It's still good.

25:46.966 --> 25:50.091
If this was faked, it's
the best job I've ever seen.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.927
Is this the last
of the surveillance feeds?

25:55.034 --> 25:57.534
Karachi, Istanbul, Taipei.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.999
Yeah. That's it.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.500
I think you should see this.

26:05.734 --> 26:09.632
Yes, we should have full access
to Echelon in a matter of hours.

26:11.402 --> 26:13.401
Forensic report.

26:13.402 --> 26:17.300
Alain, I'll let you know as soon
as we're fully operational.

26:17.402 --> 26:18.668
Absolutely.

26:18.669 --> 26:19.734
Okay. Merci.

26:19.735 --> 26:21.334
Au revoir.

26:21.335 --> 26:24.858
Brain matter was found in one of
Jack Bristow's service pistols.

26:24.969 --> 26:27.035
According to the munitions log,

26:27.036 --> 26:31.059
he checked out
a Glock 19 compact for one day,

26:31.203 --> 26:35.862
reporting a single accidental
discharge and no casualties.

26:37.037 --> 26:40.434
I thought you were here
to investigate my wife's death.

26:40.536 --> 26:44.229
The day Bristow checked out
this weapon and covered it up

26:44.337 --> 26:46.837
was the day your wife
was murdered.

26:52.304 --> 26:54.804
Do you have enough cells to do
a DNA profile?

26:54.871 --> 26:56.237
Already being done.

26:56.238 --> 26:57.370
Good.

26:57.371 --> 27:00.632
Well, if it matches with Emily,
let me know immediately.

27:00.771 --> 27:03.271
Of course.

27:09.238 --> 27:11.370
You guys like cherry Pez?

27:11.371 --> 27:13.604
You know, cherry Pez,
the little candy?

27:13.605 --> 27:16.662
Comes with the superhero thing?

27:16.772 --> 27:20.101
Yeah.
I collect the dispensers.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.305
I thought I had
the largest collection.

27:22.306 --> 27:24.965
I wrote "The Guinness Book
of World Records" about it.

27:25.073 --> 27:28.130
They said there was a girl
in Australia, 9 years old,

27:28.240 --> 27:29.805
had a larger collection.

27:29.806 --> 27:34.170
Which kind of sucked, because
she's so much younger than me.

27:34.273 --> 27:38.671
And I'm so much older than her.

27:38.807 --> 27:42.534
I'm kind of hungry.
You guys got some snacks?

27:50.841 --> 27:53.341
I agree.

27:54.942 --> 27:58.169
Something's wrong with my
computer. Can you check it?

27:58.274 --> 28:00.740
Someone launched
a denial-of-service attack.

28:00.741 --> 28:02.874
We're getting pinged
over and over.

28:02.875 --> 28:05.375
It's slowing down the network.

28:05.808 --> 28:07.041
That's odd.

28:07.042 --> 28:09.208
They didn't spoof
the origin I.P.

28:09.209 --> 28:11.731
How can someone be smart
enough to hack in here

28:11.876 --> 28:14.376
and forget
to cover their tracks?

28:20.643 --> 28:23.700
Whoa, whoa. What?
What's going on? What?

28:23.810 --> 28:25.175
We have a firewall.

28:25.176 --> 28:27.869
You broke through it.
I want to know why.

28:27.977 --> 28:31.909
I was just trying to download
an MP3 off Audiogalaxy.

28:32.010 --> 28:35.874
Look, an MP3, you know?
A music file?

28:36.511 --> 28:39.341
This, I am 75% done with.
I just...

28:39.478 --> 28:43.308
I thought the rest of it would
go a lot faster with some tunes.

28:43.411 --> 28:46.899
I'm just gonna show you the MP3.

28:50.479 --> 28:51.977
# Serious #

28:51.978 --> 28:54.705
You like Sammy Hagar?

28:54.812 --> 28:57.312
# Juju #

28:57.846 --> 29:01.209
# Untied from
the whipping post #

29:01.312 --> 29:03.812
I'll, uh, go back
to the program.

29:10.912 --> 29:13.412
Come with me.

29:15.246 --> 29:17.246
Marshall's in Mexico City?

29:17.247 --> 29:19.046
He signaled us.

29:19.047 --> 29:21.740
We traced him through
the I.P. address he used.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.246
Uh-huh.

29:23.247 --> 29:26.407
Okay. I'll notify
the extraction team at once.

29:26.514 --> 29:30.310
We'd like your permission to
conduct the operation ourselves.

29:30.414 --> 29:32.914
Yes, of course.

29:39.448 --> 29:41.347
Are you making
any progress here?

29:41.348 --> 29:43.814
Like Echelon,
Swarm has access points.

29:43.815 --> 29:45.714
If I can locate the directory,

29:45.715 --> 29:47.814
we'll know if there's
access points.

29:47.815 --> 29:50.645
We could keep SD-6
and Cuvee off the system.

29:50.748 --> 29:53.248
I'd like a coffee, please.

29:57.149 --> 29:59.649
Cream or sugar?

30:02.083 --> 30:03.281
Black.

30:03.282 --> 30:05.782
Thank you.

30:13.916 --> 30:16.282
- Kane called a meeting.
- Does she know anything?

30:16.283 --> 30:18.683
Unclear. But she has
Security Section

30:18.684 --> 30:21.650
prepared to take me in.
I have to be ready for anything.

30:22.251 --> 30:24.683
I have to admit I'm impressed.

30:24.684 --> 30:28.116
I've rarely found a record
as well-documented as yours.

30:28.251 --> 30:31.546
You couldn't have been
more thorough if you tried.

30:31.651 --> 30:34.276
If I may ask, what is it
you're looking for?

30:34.384 --> 30:36.784
There are only
two pieces of evidence

30:36.785 --> 30:38.884
I haven't been able
to corroborate.

30:38.885 --> 30:41.680
Help me with them,
and we're finished.

30:41.785 --> 30:44.342
Damn. She's got
the place wired.

30:44.452 --> 30:47.316
Jack, we make six agents
from Security Section.

30:47.419 --> 30:50.351
Every time you make
a phone call on your S.T.U.,

30:50.452 --> 30:52.618
the sim card
on your cellphone

30:52.619 --> 30:55.052
communicates with
the local cell tower.

30:55.053 --> 30:57.018
Those communications
are recorded

30:57.019 --> 30:58.552
on the card's memory chip.

30:58.553 --> 31:01.348
It's kind of like
a mini travelogue.

31:01.453 --> 31:04.044
We'll need the cell tower
codes for Istanbul,

31:04.153 --> 31:05.352
Karachi, and Taipei.

31:05.353 --> 31:07.853
Jack, listen.
What pocket is your phone in?

31:07.954 --> 31:10.053
In the left,
hold up one finger.

31:10.054 --> 31:12.120
In the right, hold up two.

31:12.121 --> 31:14.019
You two ready to order?

31:14.020 --> 31:16.520
Not yet. Thanks.

31:17.354 --> 31:18.920
You have my phone records.

31:18.921 --> 31:21.353
Which we both know
could easily be forged.

31:21.354 --> 31:24.514
So, I'd like your phone.

31:27.055 --> 31:29.577
You said there were two things.

31:30.888 --> 31:34.285
Who is Steven Haladki?

31:35.889 --> 31:39.616
He was a CIA agent
loyal to Irina Derevko.

31:39.722 --> 31:41.421
Whom you murdered.

31:41.422 --> 31:43.855
We found brain matter
in the gun you fired

31:43.856 --> 31:46.321
on the day Emily was murdered.

31:46.356 --> 31:49.379
I thought DNA tests
would prove you killed her,

31:49.490 --> 31:52.785
but instead, they prove
you killed Haladki.

31:52.890 --> 31:54.922
We had reliable intel
that Derevko

31:54.923 --> 31:57.123
was accessing information
through the CIA.

31:57.124 --> 32:00.022
Her source turned out
to be Haladki.

32:00.157 --> 32:03.554
He was crucial to her operation
and had to be removed.

32:03.657 --> 32:06.350
I got the tower codes.

32:06.457 --> 32:09.252
We can't wait for Bristow's
phone. Give me yours.

32:10.557 --> 32:13.057
Vaughn, give me your phone.

32:14.291 --> 32:16.023
The card's been reprogrammed.

32:16.024 --> 32:18.524
I'll stamp Jack's serial number
on your card.

32:18.625 --> 32:20.923
Switch them out.
Here you go.

32:20.924 --> 32:25.152
If Haladki worked with Derevko,
why hide his death from Sloane?

32:25.258 --> 32:29.690
The death of a CIA agent draws
unwanted attention and focus.

32:29.792 --> 32:33.417
When it happens, the safest
recourse is to say nothing.

32:33.559 --> 32:36.059
Ever.

32:43.559 --> 32:45.059
Are we through?

32:45.060 --> 32:47.560
As soon as I get your sim card.

32:48.494 --> 32:50.994
Yes, of course.

32:55.927 --> 32:58.427
I'll be in touch.

33:15.162 --> 33:17.662
Move in on the package.

34:26.132 --> 34:30.929
Are you ready to party?

34:35.367 --> 34:37.366
Syd, I'm ready to receive.

34:37.367 --> 34:38.665
Are we ready to party?

34:38.666 --> 34:41.995
I speak nine languages.
Techno is not one of them.

34:52.667 --> 34:54.699
I'll need cover...

34:54.701 --> 34:56.434
now.

35:03.568 --> 35:06.068
Dixon, wish me luck.

35:23.470 --> 35:25.702
I've piggybacked
the surveillance feed.

35:25.703 --> 35:28.203
Are you getting a signal?

35:28.570 --> 35:31.070
One second.

35:34.504 --> 35:37.004
Okay, Syd, I'm in.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.930
He's in the storage room
on the 47th floor.

35:42.037 --> 35:44.003
Take the eastern stairwell.

35:44.004 --> 35:46.270
The room should be
the second door on your left.

35:46.271 --> 35:48.736
- Guards?
- I make two.

35:48.771 --> 35:52.430
I'll lock down the elevators,
secure all access doors.

35:52.538 --> 35:54.171
That should keep everyone away.

35:54.172 --> 35:56.797
But, Syd, be careful.

35:59.339 --> 36:02.396
Program's done. We'll be
uplinked to Echelon in 2 minutes.

36:02.506 --> 36:05.006
Excellent.

36:11.206 --> 36:13.439
Tell your, uh...

36:13.440 --> 36:15.472
boss or whatever that...

36:15.473 --> 36:17.973
I'm finished.

36:18.974 --> 36:21.474
The program's written.

36:29.407 --> 36:32.736
We estimated SD-6 would have
Echelon operational by midnight.

36:32.841 --> 36:34.173
It's 10 after.

36:34.174 --> 36:37.469
The blue are Echelon access
points. The red are Swarm.

36:37.574 --> 36:39.141
You said you'd find overlap.

36:39.142 --> 36:41.341
I said I'd find out
if one overlapped.

36:41.342 --> 36:44.274
- And if they don't?
- Then I can't help you.

37:05.510 --> 37:07.842
You know where
you can go, you freak?

37:07.843 --> 37:11.366
- Kill him!
- Straight to hell, my friend!

37:18.910 --> 37:21.410
Kill his mother!

37:52.779 --> 37:53.879
Hi.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.211
Wow.

37:56.212 --> 37:58.712
Let's go.

37:59.113 --> 38:01.346
Syd, we've got a problem.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.146
I've been locked out.

38:03.147 --> 38:05.146
Their security system
is operational.

38:05.147 --> 38:07.647
Get out of there now.

38:17.947 --> 38:20.080
Dixon, we're trapped.

38:20.081 --> 38:21.780
I'll get over to you now.

38:21.781 --> 38:24.281
There's no time.

38:31.648 --> 38:34.148
Come on!

38:35.349 --> 38:37.748
- We're on the 47th floor.
- Remember London?

38:37.749 --> 38:40.306
I compressed a tactical
parachute in my jacket?

38:40.449 --> 38:42.648
Well, this one's got it, too.

38:42.649 --> 38:45.843
Along with a hyper-extending
tandem sling. Come here.

38:46.382 --> 38:48.182
I got it.

38:48.183 --> 38:50.910
Hi. My name
is Marshall J. Flinkman.

38:51.016 --> 38:53.516
And I'm here to rescue you.

39:04.950 --> 39:08.438
If this was some kind
of manipulation...

39:14.551 --> 39:17.244
The overlapping access point.

39:17.985 --> 39:20.485
As promised.

39:20.951 --> 39:23.746
Confirming a match
with Echelon right now.

39:23.851 --> 39:27.806
Close the access point,
and SD-6 will be shut out.

39:30.819 --> 39:33.319
We have confirmation.

39:34.086 --> 39:36.252
It's a match.

39:36.253 --> 39:41.049
As promised, Alain,
we have Echelon at our disposal.

39:41.153 --> 39:43.653
Oui.

39:47.253 --> 39:49.753
I'm afraid something's happened.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.952
So, Marshall saved our lives.

39:58.053 --> 40:02.076
How did I return the favor?
By bringing him back to SD-6.

40:02.187 --> 40:03.820
We had to, Syd.

40:03.821 --> 40:06.220
Bringing Marshall into the CIA
didn't make sense.

40:06.221 --> 40:10.483
- Not after Sloane got Echelon.
- I know. It's just...

40:10.588 --> 40:13.782
Marshall has no idea
who he's really working for.

40:13.889 --> 40:19.549
# Here by my side, an angel #

40:22.788 --> 40:28.914
# Here by my side, the Devil #

40:31.990 --> 40:36.615
# Never turn your back on me #

40:38.257 --> 40:42.053
It won't always be like this.
Right?

40:44.390 --> 40:46.890
It will end.

40:50.323 --> 40:52.823
I should go.

41:03.491 --> 41:05.991
Do not turn on the lights.

41:09.225 --> 41:11.657
You shouldn't have run
from her, Jack.

41:11.658 --> 41:14.317
Kane needs someone to blame.

41:14.425 --> 41:16.525
since she can't find
who murdered Emily,

41:16.526 --> 41:19.026
she's decided to blame me.

41:23.826 --> 41:26.451
I did not murder your wife.

41:26.559 --> 41:30.582
But if I don't find who did,
Kane will frame me for it.

41:32.093 --> 41:33.759
I have some leads.

41:33.760 --> 41:36.260
I need you
to pursue them for me.

41:38.660 --> 41:41.160
Can I trust you to do that?

41:41.527 --> 41:45.425
Of course.
This will stay between us.

42:08.962 --> 42:09.961
Hello?

42:09.962 --> 42:13.359
Agent Kane. Arvin Sloane.

42:14.563 --> 42:17.892
Jack Bristow just left my house.
