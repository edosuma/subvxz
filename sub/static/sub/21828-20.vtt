WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.542
(Ryan)
Previously on Mech-X4...

00:04.625 --> 00:05.959
(Traegar)
I'll have enough red bloom

00:06.041 --> 00:09.208
to infect and control
every human on the planet.

00:09.291 --> 00:11.875
(Ryan) So much information
from all over the world.

00:11.959 --> 00:13.458
(Veracity)
The techno booster's working!

00:13.542 --> 00:16.166
You're being super saturated by the
Thirty's power without it hurting you.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.667
(Ryan) Something's happening in London.

00:17.750 --> 00:21.041
Grey's there in her monster form, she's
spreading the bloom all over the city.

00:43.792 --> 00:45.333
Ryan, please don't!

00:45.417 --> 00:47.792
It's me, your best friend!

00:47.875 --> 00:49.125
(Harris)
Ryan!

00:50.667 --> 00:51.834
Whoa.

00:51.917 --> 00:53.500
Easy there, honey.
It's just me.

00:53.583 --> 00:55.583
Sorry.
I was just thinking.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.458
Mom, have you ever had to

00:59.542 --> 01:01.291
hurt somebody
you really care about?

01:01.375 --> 01:03.875
Oh. Yeah, I've had to make
some tough choices,

01:03.959 --> 01:05.542
but nothing like
what you're dealing with.

01:07.041 --> 01:08.917
Honey, sometimes...

01:09.000 --> 01:10.542
sometimes you have
to hurt people

01:10.625 --> 01:12.333
that you care about
for their own good.

01:12.417 --> 01:15.709
Like separating you
from Mr. Wooby.

01:15.792 --> 01:17.500
You cried for a week.

01:17.583 --> 01:20.208
This problem's a little
bigger than Wooby.

01:20.291 --> 01:22.792
(chuckles)
Tell that to your four-year-old self.

01:24.333 --> 01:27.291
I wish I could just lift
all this off your shoulders,

01:27.375 --> 01:28.709
but I can't, can I?

01:30.917 --> 01:32.458
(sighs)

01:32.542 --> 01:33.834
Harris is my best friend.

01:33.917 --> 01:35.792
I know.

01:35.875 --> 01:37.083
And I also know this.

01:37.166 --> 01:39.667
Whatever you choose to do...

01:39.750 --> 01:41.500
will be the right thing.

01:41.583 --> 01:44.709
Robot's ready.
We gotta get to London.

01:53.583 --> 01:55.375
You should be safe here.

01:55.458 --> 01:57.542
Well, be careful,
both of you.

02:03.709 --> 02:06.083
(Grace)
Be careful, all of you!

02:06.166 --> 02:08.500
(mechanical whirring)

02:12.500 --> 02:13.792
(theme music playing)

02:47.083 --> 02:48.583
(engines whining)

02:54.417 --> 02:56.959
-(Veracity) Whoa, easy there, Top Gun.
-(rapid beeping)

02:57.041 --> 02:58.333
You're red-lining the engines.

02:58.417 --> 02:59.500
Slow it down.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.834
What? Oh, yeah, that's right.

03:01.917 --> 03:03.583
I'm still getting used
to my power-up.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.333
But you're used to the girdle.
Good for you.

03:05.417 --> 03:06.583
It's not a girdle.

03:06.667 --> 03:07.959
-Hmm.
-(Veracity) No, Ryan's right.

03:08.041 --> 03:09.583
It... it's more like a corset.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.792
What... is... a... corset?

03:11.875 --> 03:13.208
How do you spell that?

03:15.750 --> 03:17.000
(pinging)

03:17.083 --> 03:18.125
Guys!

03:18.208 --> 03:20.125
Look, London.

03:25.917 --> 03:27.917
Can the, uh, robot
locate Emma Watson?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.208
Spyder, you can be
rejected by wizards

03:30.291 --> 03:31.959
after we take out Grey.

03:37.959 --> 03:40.500
(roaring)

03:41.750 --> 03:43.458
(people screaming)

03:52.667 --> 03:54.458
(alarms blaring)

04:04.208 --> 04:06.375
(screaming)

04:10.625 --> 04:11.709
(roars)

04:19.542 --> 04:21.750
-Veracity!
-Scanning.

04:21.834 --> 04:24.417
Looks like the red bloom is stored
inside the monster's big claws.

04:26.792 --> 04:28.000
Dude.

04:30.458 --> 04:31.959
It's going for your head again!

04:35.750 --> 04:37.625
(roars)

04:41.834 --> 04:43.083
Nice!

04:43.166 --> 04:45.917
Yeah? Spyder, plasma axe!

04:47.458 --> 04:49.083
Check this out.

04:55.625 --> 04:57.083
(grunting)

05:04.875 --> 05:05.917
(roars)

05:10.000 --> 05:12.041
-Dang, son.
-(laughs)

05:17.041 --> 05:18.166
She's making a run for it!

05:28.166 --> 05:29.959
(laughter)

05:30.041 --> 05:31.875
-Whoo!
-(cheers)

05:31.959 --> 05:33.625
-Yo, nerd high-five!
-Yeah!

05:33.709 --> 05:35.166
I'd high-five, but...

05:35.250 --> 05:36.500
I'm up here.

05:39.792 --> 05:41.083
Grey is gone.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.959
I can no longer feel
her connection to the ooze.

05:46.875 --> 05:48.250
Ryan!

05:49.375 --> 05:50.625
(electricity crackling)

05:50.709 --> 05:52.750
(Harris)
Whoa, easy big guy.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.834
We can always
get more flunkies.

05:54.917 --> 05:57.542
The Far East. Go now!

06:03.166 --> 06:04.166
You need a hug?

06:04.250 --> 06:05.208
-No.
-Sure?

06:05.291 --> 06:06.625
-Still no.
-Okay.

06:09.625 --> 06:11.625
(sirens blaring)

06:22.625 --> 06:24.083
(Mark)
What is going on?

06:25.083 --> 06:27.667
Looks like the ooze
is migrating underground.

06:27.750 --> 06:31.417
Almost like it's... like it's
being pulled somewhere.

06:33.083 --> 06:35.250
It's Traegar. Gotta be.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.834
(Ryan) He must need the ooze back
to make more of the bloom.

06:38.917 --> 06:40.792
It's enough
to infect another city.

06:46.792 --> 06:48.250
-(cracks neck)
-(sighs)

06:53.667 --> 06:55.625
Aw, man, this is weird.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.583
She has been purged
of ooze completely,

06:58.667 --> 07:02.000
but I'm barely
reading any vitals.

07:02.083 --> 07:04.709
So, she's not made
of ooze like Traegar.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.333
Ha! No.

07:06.417 --> 07:08.083
She's clearly made
of bad life decisions.

07:10.291 --> 07:12.041
Is, um...

07:12.125 --> 07:13.583
is that what we're
gonna do to Harris?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.709
If it's the only way
to save the world...

07:16.667 --> 07:17.959
we'll do whatever we have to.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.917
Ooh.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.166
Uh, I'm not sure

07:25.250 --> 07:27.542
what those things
on Grey's neck are, but...

07:27.625 --> 07:28.875
her body's okay.

07:28.959 --> 07:30.333
There's just
no brain activity.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.375
It's like a catatonic
state or something.

07:33.375 --> 07:34.375
(hollow tapping)

07:34.458 --> 07:35.542
Nobody's home.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.166
Oh! Well, in that case.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.083
-I call dibs on her knifey things.
-I think, uh...

07:39.166 --> 07:40.750
Dude, maybe you should
just put that down.

07:40.834 --> 07:42.083
-(grunts)
-Hey!

07:43.083 --> 07:44.041
Ha!

07:45.625 --> 07:47.959
Guys, come on.
I'm the weapons guy.

07:48.041 --> 07:49.542
You don't think I can handle...

07:50.208 --> 07:51.500
Oh! Ooh!

07:51.583 --> 07:54.000
(shrieking)

07:54.083 --> 07:55.166
So, it's in your foot.

07:55.250 --> 07:56.917
Yeah. Yeah.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.041
She's got another one
if you want a matching pair.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.500
(groans)

08:00.583 --> 08:01.917
Come on, dingus,
I'll patch you up.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.625
(Spyder gasping)

08:06.125 --> 08:08.792
(moaning)

08:12.959 --> 08:15.041
It's strange.

08:15.125 --> 08:16.792
Seems like these
marks on Grey's neck

08:16.875 --> 08:19.583
could maybe be ooze tendrils
connected to her brain.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.166
-(Spyder) Ow! My foot!
-(Mark) I'm sorry.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.959
I thought Grey and Harris
transformed into the monsters

08:24.041 --> 08:25.750
like the Hulk, and...

08:27.125 --> 08:28.250
All I can think of
is the Hulk.

08:28.333 --> 08:32.041
What... what if she created
the monster around her body?

08:32.125 --> 08:35.041
Like maybe, she has
those ooze tendrils

08:35.125 --> 08:36.417
connecting to her brain,

08:36.500 --> 08:38.333
so she could pilot the monster.

08:38.417 --> 08:39.959
Like how I pilot the robot.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.041
Or how Harper
piloted his beast.

08:43.166 --> 08:44.625
So, you're saying Harris,

08:44.709 --> 08:46.083
like human Harris,

08:46.166 --> 08:47.542
is inside that shark thing?

08:49.333 --> 08:51.041
But if we free him,

08:51.125 --> 08:52.375
the monster dies,

08:52.458 --> 08:53.667
and we can end the fight without...

08:53.750 --> 08:56.125
Turning him into that.

08:57.125 --> 08:58.750
See if you can figure out
a way to get him out.

08:58.834 --> 09:00.750
-(voices overlapping)
-According to the news feeds,

09:00.834 --> 09:02.583
Harris is spreading the bloom
over Shanghai.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.166
(screaming)

09:10.834 --> 09:12.959
(roars)

09:15.542 --> 09:16.583
(alarms blaring)

09:19.166 --> 09:21.166
(grunting)

09:39.667 --> 09:42.125
Dude, we're flying.
Shouldn't you be on the control pad

09:42.208 --> 09:45.041
or looking out the visor
to make sure we don't hit anything?

09:45.125 --> 09:47.291
I'm powerful enough to fly
this thing from anywhere.

09:48.417 --> 09:51.417
Uh, so, we may have figured out
how to kill two birds with one stone.

09:52.667 --> 09:55.125
Have you ever actually
tried to do that?

09:55.208 --> 09:56.333
It's totally hard.

09:56.417 --> 09:59.959
Birds do not get the concept
of standing in a line.

10:00.041 --> 10:01.875
I mean, Veracity might
have figured out

10:01.959 --> 10:04.458
how to stop the monster
and save Harris.

10:04.542 --> 10:06.709
(Veracity) Harris is, essentially,
the monster's heart.

10:06.792 --> 10:09.250
So if we can get in there,
rescue him.

10:09.417 --> 10:11.583
No more heart,
no more monster.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.208
We can get Harris back.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.875
This is the most powerful
tranquilizer that I can make.

10:17.959 --> 10:20.500
Just one dose will knock
him out for a few minutes.

10:21.667 --> 10:24.208
Hopefully without any
permanent damage.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.834
Don't love "hopefully."

10:25.917 --> 10:28.291
(nervously) And one of us is supposed
to go inside the monster

10:28.375 --> 10:30.375
to get Harris out.

10:30.458 --> 10:31.500
That's crazy.

10:31.583 --> 10:32.959
And I wanna do it.

10:33.041 --> 10:34.417
(Mark)
No.

10:36.458 --> 10:37.792
I'll do it.

10:40.250 --> 10:41.917
I'm the reason he's in there.

10:42.917 --> 10:44.375
It's up to me to get him out.

10:46.208 --> 10:49.375
I just... I just need
a minute to gear up.

11:02.125 --> 11:03.291
Mark...

11:04.792 --> 11:05.834
(Mark)
Three?

11:06.959 --> 11:08.542
Didn't you hear Veracity?

11:09.583 --> 11:12.291
Just one of these
is really strong. Three?

11:12.375 --> 11:14.417
-It'll take out Harris for good.
-I know.

11:15.458 --> 11:17.625
-Ryan...
-I blew it in Brazil.

11:19.542 --> 11:22.083
If I had taken Harris down,

11:22.166 --> 11:24.083
we would've destroyed the blooms.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.375
But I wanted my friend back.

11:29.750 --> 11:33.083
I put what I wanted
above everything else.

11:33.166 --> 11:35.375
-You were trying to help your friend.
-I was selfish!

11:37.709 --> 11:39.375
And the world
is paying the price!

11:39.458 --> 11:41.250
I can't let that happen again.

11:46.792 --> 11:49.709
If something goes wrong,

11:49.792 --> 11:51.583
and you can't
get Harris out...

11:54.458 --> 11:55.458
you gotta do it.

11:55.542 --> 11:57.333
I can't.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.875
Hey!

11:58.959 --> 12:01.291
You kept your
Harris plan from me,

12:01.375 --> 12:03.333
because you thought
I couldn't make the tough calls.

12:03.417 --> 12:05.792
Well, here I am making one.

12:12.917 --> 12:13.959
(engines roaring)

12:19.125 --> 12:20.417
China!

12:20.500 --> 12:22.583
Ooh! Can the robot
locate Jackie Chan?

12:22.667 --> 12:25.375
I... I wanna know the
best way to fall off a roof.

12:25.458 --> 12:26.625
The best way
to fall off a roof

12:26.709 --> 12:28.333
would be to
not fall off a roof.

12:33.834 --> 12:35.125
Where is he?

12:41.750 --> 12:43.417
(rumbling)

12:47.375 --> 12:48.709
(roaring)

12:53.875 --> 12:55.083
Okay!

12:55.166 --> 12:57.875
Let's see if this robot fist
is as good as Harper thinks.

12:57.959 --> 13:00.542
-Mark, you good to go?
-Ready.

13:01.917 --> 13:03.041
All systems online.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.625
(Electronic Voice)
Welcome to the Harp fist.

13:05.709 --> 13:08.375
Are you ready to abandon the team
in the middle of a fight?

13:08.458 --> 13:10.750
You know he built this as his
personal escape pod, right?

13:10.834 --> 13:12.875
(Ryan)
Yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.333
But I got a better use for it.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.542
(roars)

13:29.875 --> 13:31.542
(panting)

13:32.542 --> 13:33.959
Mark, you okay in there?

13:34.041 --> 13:36.000
I'm in a tiny cockpit,
in a giant robot hand,

13:36.083 --> 13:38.125
you shot into a monster.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.458
Pretty far from okay.

13:47.333 --> 13:48.375
(groans)

14:02.083 --> 14:03.542
(distorted)
Coming here was a mistake!

14:13.709 --> 14:15.041
(roaring)

14:20.583 --> 14:22.125
Okay!

14:22.208 --> 14:24.208
Let's see some of those
super-charged powers.

14:24.291 --> 14:25.625
Mark and Harris
are both in there!

14:25.709 --> 14:27.250
I can't hurt
the monster too much.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.667
(monster roaring)

14:34.750 --> 14:36.250
(mechanical whirring)

14:45.750 --> 14:47.291
Harris, I'm here to save you.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.500
You will fail!

14:49.583 --> 14:50.750
(Mark)
Dude, this isn't you.

14:50.834 --> 14:52.291
You can't be the bad guy.

14:52.375 --> 14:55.625
The real Harris
is kind and generous.

14:55.709 --> 14:57.583
(grunting)

14:58.875 --> 15:00.709
Know how I know?

15:00.792 --> 15:03.375
Ryan told me what you did
after the first monster battle.

15:03.458 --> 15:05.208
Ryan wasn't sure
if he wanted me on the team,

15:05.291 --> 15:07.000
but you talked him into it!

15:07.083 --> 15:08.500
I'm a hero because of you.

15:08.583 --> 15:11.542
I got my brother back
because of you.

15:13.625 --> 15:16.500
I... I remember.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.125
That makes us
more than teammates.

15:19.208 --> 15:20.583
More than friends.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.458
We're family.

15:22.542 --> 15:25.500
And Harris Harris Junior
would never hurt his family!

15:25.583 --> 15:27.458
(crackling)

15:30.291 --> 15:31.458
That's right.

15:31.542 --> 15:33.417
Come back to us, Harris.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.709
I need that sock garter-wearing,

15:34.792 --> 15:37.458
girl-crazy mathlete
who hates Traeger.

15:38.834 --> 15:40.959
I am not girl-crazy!

15:41.041 --> 15:43.041
(normal voice)
I like them a normal amount.

15:52.959 --> 15:53.959
It's me.

15:54.041 --> 15:55.291
But not for long!

15:55.375 --> 15:57.000
I knew I rocked
that emotional speech.

15:57.083 --> 15:58.750
I worked on that for, like...

15:58.834 --> 16:00.625
-twelve...
-Not the time!

16:00.709 --> 16:02.583
Right, right. Uh...

16:02.667 --> 16:03.917
How do I get you
out of this mess?

16:05.208 --> 16:07.792
(growls)

16:07.875 --> 16:10.000
The monster's not doing anything.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.458
Come on, Mark.

16:11.542 --> 16:13.709
Come on.
Whatever you're doing is working.

16:14.709 --> 16:15.834
(screams)

16:16.834 --> 16:18.125
You can't just pull me out.

16:18.208 --> 16:20.542
My body's full merged
with the monster.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.458
Dude, there's gotta be another way.

16:22.542 --> 16:24.750
If I can't disconnect you...

16:27.792 --> 16:30.291
-Ryan says I gotta.
-Ryan's right.

16:30.375 --> 16:33.041
What are you saying?

16:33.125 --> 16:34.500
You have to take me down.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.208
I can't do that!

16:37.291 --> 16:38.917
You just have to.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.083
-(rumbling)
-(Harris grunting)

16:43.083 --> 16:46.000
I can't, all right?
Do you know what three will do to you?

16:46.083 --> 16:47.291
I don't know if I'll get you back!

16:47.375 --> 16:49.125
I'm starting to lose control again.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.125
(roars)

16:52.208 --> 16:54.208
Guys, Mark failed!

16:57.417 --> 16:58.750
(roars)

17:01.750 --> 17:03.500
Mark, you have to do it.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.041
(grunts)

17:07.917 --> 17:09.333
(roars)

17:17.375 --> 17:19.458
That's what happened to Grey.

17:19.542 --> 17:21.583
Oh, no.

17:21.667 --> 17:24.417
He was supposed
to get Harris out.

17:28.166 --> 17:29.750
(grunts, gasps)

17:31.750 --> 17:33.792
Harris is gone.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.083
I liked that kid.

17:39.125 --> 17:42.709
Such a waste. So much... potential.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.417
This will require
a change in tactics.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.709
(rumbling)

18:04.917 --> 18:06.667
-(rapid beeping)
-(alarms blaring)

18:07.667 --> 18:09.166
Guys, his heart's not beating!

18:09.917 --> 18:12.166
-I don't think he's breathing either.
-I know CPR.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.500
-Get the pillow.
-Okay, okay.

18:14.583 --> 18:15.625
All right.

18:17.417 --> 18:19.000
(Mark panting)

18:19.083 --> 18:20.291
(Veracity)
Okay.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.917
-What did you do to him?
-What he needed to do.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.417
Actually, what
Harris told me to do.

18:27.542 --> 18:29.041
He said the only way
to really save him

18:29.125 --> 18:32.041
was to trick Traegar
into thinking he was gone.

18:32.125 --> 18:34.792
So Traegar would remove all the ooze
from his body just like Grey?

18:34.875 --> 18:35.959
Right.

18:36.041 --> 18:38.625
(Veracity) But this time,
tricking Traegar into unplugging first.

18:39.625 --> 18:40.917
I used all the tranqs on him.

18:42.333 --> 18:44.500
Harris said it was up to us
to bring him back

18:44.583 --> 18:45.917
after that ooze was gone.

18:47.375 --> 18:48.917
And if we can't?

18:51.041 --> 18:52.583
He said it was better than being a slave.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.375
-(monitor beeping)
-(Spyder crying)

18:54.458 --> 18:56.542
(monitor flatlines)

18:59.834 --> 19:01.333
Oh, no, no, no, no.

19:02.417 --> 19:05.291
No, we didn't go through
all this just to lose him.

19:05.375 --> 19:08.125
(all sobbing)

19:09.417 --> 19:11.000
We are not losing him!

19:12.041 --> 19:13.709
Harris...

19:13.792 --> 19:16.583
Harris, come on. Come back to us, please.
I'll do anything.

19:16.667 --> 19:19.000
(Veracity) Guys, his heart's still not
beating.

19:23.792 --> 19:26.542
(Ryan)
Guys, I can use my power.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.792
I can see the electricity
inside Harris' body.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.375
Electricity in his body?

19:30.458 --> 19:31.583
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:31.667 --> 19:33.709
The heart has nodes that conduct
electricity to make it beat.

19:33.792 --> 19:36.333
I don't want a science lesson.
I want Harris back.

19:36.417 --> 19:37.542
Let's go for both.

19:37.625 --> 19:38.792
Let's go for both!

19:42.542 --> 19:43.542
(grunts)

19:45.709 --> 19:46.959
(grunts)

19:47.041 --> 19:49.333
(Ryan screaming)

19:52.500 --> 19:53.959
(screams)

19:55.291 --> 19:56.542
(gasps)

20:00.583 --> 20:02.208
I can't believe you wasted me.

20:02.291 --> 20:03.291
(laughter)

20:03.375 --> 20:04.792
Good job!

20:06.166 --> 20:08.041
And I can't believe you
gave me mouth-to-mouth.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.542
I most certainly did not.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.792
Not when I tell the story.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.041
I'll allow it...

20:15.542 --> 20:16.458
Welcome back, buddy.

20:22.542 --> 20:24.375
(Spyder) (whistling)
Okay!

20:25.083 --> 20:26.625
Everybody, clear the way.

20:26.709 --> 20:29.083
This man was a corpse
about an hour ago.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.250
Need anything?

20:30.333 --> 20:31.458
Ice pack, foot rub?

20:33.083 --> 20:34.542
(whispers)
You're not a zombie, are you?

20:34.625 --> 20:35.917
-No.
-No!

20:36.000 --> 20:37.375
Back to classic Harris.

20:37.458 --> 20:40.083
Evil me made some
questionable wardrobe choices.

20:40.166 --> 20:41.875
A black jacket with a turtleneck?

20:41.959 --> 20:44.291
Was I supposed to be an
evil liberal arts professor?

20:44.375 --> 20:46.875
All right, the fist is reattached,
so we're on our way home.

20:46.959 --> 20:48.250
Oh, and I'm tracking the ooze.

20:48.333 --> 20:51.083
It disappeared underground,
back to Traegar, so...

20:51.166 --> 20:52.625
we should know where he is soon.

20:54.792 --> 20:55.834
Feels good to win again.

20:58.709 --> 21:00.542
But we still need to beat
Traegar and Harper.

21:00.625 --> 21:01.959
And figure out
how to cure everyone

21:02.041 --> 21:04.166
that's already been infected.

21:04.250 --> 21:05.458
When I was possessed,

21:05.542 --> 21:07.041
I could hear
Traegar's voice in my head.

21:07.125 --> 21:09.542
If we take out Traegar,
no more voice.

21:09.625 --> 21:11.000
Everyone gets
their free will back,

21:11.083 --> 21:13.041
and the ooze in their
bodies go dormant.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.959
(Veracity)
We still have, let's see,

21:15.041 --> 21:17.583
we have 50%
of your power-up left.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.750
Hopefully that's enough
to defeat Big Red.

21:20.792 --> 21:22.166
Let's find Traegar

21:22.250 --> 21:23.625
and defeat him once and for all.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.500
-What are we doing here?
-I lost both my monsters.

21:30.583 --> 21:33.125
My ability to spread the bloom
has been compromised.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.583
Can't you just, you know,

21:34.667 --> 21:36.917
Godzilla up
and spread the rest yourself?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.500
The robot defeated both my champions.

21:40.583 --> 21:42.917
The wisest course of action
is to continue the plan

21:43.000 --> 21:45.375
in a place the robot cannot follow.

21:45.458 --> 21:47.667
(Man) We're gonna reset the remote sites
to two-one-four.

21:47.750 --> 21:50.417
-We're ready now.
-We and the remaining bloom

21:50.500 --> 21:51.875
are taking a trip.

21:52.875 --> 21:55.041
To outer space?

21:56.875 --> 21:57.917
Cool.

22:03.125 --> 22:05.333
(theme music playing)
