WEBVTT

00:00.919 --> 00:02.587
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.796 --> 00:05.090
I don't think it's a good idea
for us to mix business

00:05.298 --> 00:06.675
with whatever it is
we were doing.

00:06.883 --> 00:09.135
I know all the reasons
it can't work
but I don't care,

00:09.344 --> 00:10.637
I want us to be
together again.

00:12.889 --> 00:14.349
If we're gonna make
any real headway
with the Super Max recipe,

00:14.557 --> 00:17.727
we need the DNA of
a coherent functional zombie.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.606
- Oh my God, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

00:21.815 --> 00:23.775
Hey, you! Didn't know you
existed outside the station.

00:23.984 --> 00:26.778
Liv, Major, this is
Agent Bozzio from the FBI.

00:26.987 --> 00:29.114
Seems like romance
is in the air.

00:29.322 --> 00:31.825
<i>I find it fascinating
that we never talk
about your love life.</i>

00:57.017 --> 00:57.934
Morning, stranger.

00:59.310 --> 01:00.854
Hangover cure?

01:01.062 --> 01:03.231
Just a weird craving.

01:03.398 --> 01:05.066
At least it's not
hollandaise sauce, right?

01:07.360 --> 01:10.196
So, where have you
been sleeping, young lady?

01:10.405 --> 01:12.115
At my, uh, boyfriend's.

01:12.866 --> 01:14.284
What?

01:14.492 --> 01:16.161
Since when do you
have a boyfriend?

01:16.369 --> 01:18.788
I used to be engaged to him.
So he kinda had a head start.

01:20.415 --> 01:21.374
Oh.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.960
So that's happening, huh?

01:24.169 --> 01:27.088
I mean, he's still quality,
grade-A boyfriend material.

01:28.006 --> 01:29.007
Barely used.

01:29.215 --> 01:31.301
Of course.

01:31.509 --> 01:35.221
Sorry. I had the worst
experience trying to pick
things back up with an ex.

01:35.430 --> 01:39.434
- What happened?
- Oh, after a few
glorious weeks,

01:39.642 --> 01:43.521
we realized all the things
that broke us up
hadn't really gone away.

01:45.523 --> 01:47.650
But I'm sure
you guys'll be great.

01:48.777 --> 01:49.736
I gotta run.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.210
Regina!

02:07.712 --> 02:08.797
Do I know you?

02:09.005 --> 02:10.173
You brought this on yourself.

02:10.381 --> 02:11.508
Argh!

02:11.716 --> 02:14.594
Stay away from...

02:16.179 --> 02:18.556
Help! Help!

02:18.765 --> 02:19.808
Help!

02:23.019 --> 02:23.895
You...

02:25.855 --> 02:28.942
Whoever you are,
you messed
with the wrong woman.

02:37.075 --> 02:39.953
Get in the car.
Get in the car!

02:41.830 --> 02:43.748
Regina Sumner. Thirty-three.

02:43.957 --> 02:46.084
She's a wedding planner
who rents office space
in the building.

02:46.292 --> 02:48.545
No camera in the garage.
No witnesses.

02:48.753 --> 02:50.755
Killer left her wallet
and her purse.

02:50.964 --> 02:52.674
See these bruises?

02:52.882 --> 02:54.425
Uh, looks like
the killer punched her
before shooting her.

02:54.634 --> 02:56.302
Oh, what did I miss?

02:56.511 --> 02:59.264
Well, well, well.
Look who finally
bothered to show up.

02:59.472 --> 03:01.850
Don't start.
I've had the worst morning.

03:02.058 --> 03:03.726
Yeah? Worse than hers?

03:09.107 --> 03:10.066
Are you okay?

03:12.861 --> 03:14.404
I know her.

03:15.947 --> 03:17.365
We used to date.

03:21.619 --> 03:24.247
I'm so sorry, Clive.
That's awful.

03:24.455 --> 03:27.625
Found the gun under a car.
It's a 9 millimeter Beretta.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.752
Tsk... It's my gun.

03:57.989 --> 04:00.158
Super Max taste test.

04:00.366 --> 04:02.994
Glass A, bubblegum with,

04:03.203 --> 04:04.829
ooh, hint of mint.

04:06.956 --> 04:07.999
And Glass B,

04:10.585 --> 04:11.544
yellow.

04:13.504 --> 04:14.923
Yellow isn't a flavor.

04:15.131 --> 04:16.507
And you're not
listening to me.

04:16.716 --> 04:19.093
Uh, yes, I am.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.679
Our zombie hunter is sleeping
with your zombie roommate.

04:21.888 --> 04:24.349
Looks like you'll be
spending little more time
at your pied-a-terre.

04:25.475 --> 04:27.018
Come on, sample. Sample.

04:27.227 --> 04:29.812
I value your key demo input.

04:35.109 --> 04:38.029
Ugh. Mystery solved.

04:38.238 --> 04:40.156
Yellow represents
its urine flavor.

04:42.075 --> 04:44.285
Can you register
some concern with my news?

04:44.494 --> 04:46.162
You had me move in with her,

04:46.371 --> 04:47.705
so you wouldn't
get blind-sided by
this sort of thing.

04:47.914 --> 04:49.457
Stay on task, sweetie.

04:55.505 --> 04:57.757
Go with the urine-flavor.

04:57.966 --> 05:02.053
So the thought of a zombie
who works for the police
and hates you,

05:02.262 --> 05:05.265
finding out we're killing
zombies really isn't
worth worrying about?

05:05.473 --> 05:09.352
Okay, so you really think
she's going to go to
all her cop buddies, and say,

05:09.560 --> 05:11.354
"Hey, everyone! Zombies exist!

05:11.562 --> 05:14.107
"Let's go arrest
all those guys who rid
the city of zombies."

05:14.315 --> 05:15.358
Please.

05:15.566 --> 05:18.528
Maybe. Or maybe
she just gets hungry one night
and decides to eat you.

05:18.736 --> 05:22.323
Oh, as I know
you've already redecorated
my office in your mind,

05:22.532 --> 05:23.700
you can only hope.

05:23.908 --> 05:25.368
I'll be going with
a mid-century vibe.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.412
Desk facing north.
Warhol originals.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.539
Your Elon Musk bobble-head
in the trash.

05:29.747 --> 05:31.874
- Hmm.
<i>Vaughn. They're
ready for you in the lab.</i>

05:32.083 --> 05:33.584
I got the brains.

05:33.793 --> 05:37.672
We both got the looks.
Let's make lots of money.

05:39.924 --> 05:44.429
Look. Major has killed,
by my count, eight zombies.

05:44.637 --> 05:49.267
His last three, quote-unquote
innocent zombies.

05:49.475 --> 05:51.769
You think that's something
you tell the zombie you love?

05:51.978 --> 05:53.646
Besides, I think I know
the guy better than you.

05:55.064 --> 05:56.316
You do, huh?

05:56.524 --> 05:58.860
Sure, he's training me
four days a week.

05:59.068 --> 06:01.863
He was a bit of
a Debbie Downer at first,
but he's coming around.

06:02.030 --> 06:05.408
We have some legit man-to-mans
on back-and-bi's day.

06:05.616 --> 06:08.703
- Oh.
- Anyway, I'm
an irresistible force.

06:15.585 --> 06:16.878
I think you'll be pleased.

06:17.045 --> 06:19.547
The blood sample Rita
provided us was the key.

06:19.756 --> 06:21.883
What? Who is this?
Where's Dr. Erving?

06:22.050 --> 06:23.718
Oh, lab accident.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.803
Dr. Lockett's getting
his big break.

06:26.012 --> 06:28.306
They're like drummers
for <i>Spinal Tap.</i>

06:30.308 --> 06:31.768
We're ready
for the Super Max.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.901
As you can see,

06:40.109 --> 06:42.612
the test subject
is struggling to keep up
at three miles per hour.

06:44.489 --> 06:46.324
But once the Super Max
enters the blood stream...

06:47.575 --> 06:48.618
The results are immediate.

06:51.079 --> 06:53.581
We can crank
the treadmill up as high
as nine miles per hour.

06:53.748 --> 06:56.542
Endurance and strength
also sky rocket.

06:56.751 --> 06:58.086
Woah.

06:59.212 --> 07:01.547
I'm impressed.

07:01.756 --> 07:04.300
Considering how little cash
your typical member
of the undead carries,

07:04.509 --> 07:07.178
when will we be seeing
these results with a human?

07:07.387 --> 07:09.931
Well, I'm still looking
for a volunteer on my team.

07:10.139 --> 07:11.474
Seeing as how
we're still not sure

07:11.682 --> 07:13.184
if we've eliminated
the violent side effects.

07:15.311 --> 07:16.270
No need.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.273
I think I've got
somebody in mind.

07:21.359 --> 07:22.944
Please don't be
a 9 millimeter.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.071
Please don't be
a 9 millimeter.

07:26.197 --> 07:27.698
9 millimeter.

07:27.907 --> 07:29.450
Not a good day
for Team Babineaux.

07:29.659 --> 07:30.785
It gets worse.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.037
Detective Cavanaugh
is on the case.

07:33.246 --> 07:34.580
Detective Cavanaugh?

07:34.789 --> 07:36.374
That weasel-faced kiss-ass?

07:36.582 --> 07:39.168
He'd waterboard his own mom
if it meant making lieutenant.

07:39.377 --> 07:41.212
To make lieutenant?

07:41.421 --> 07:43.506
C'mon. I'm not a monster.

07:45.049 --> 07:46.759
Now, for captain's bars?

07:46.968 --> 07:50.054
I'd go full Gitmo
on the old biddy.

07:50.263 --> 07:51.389
Give me all the gory details.

07:53.224 --> 07:56.060
The victim suffered
blows to the face.

07:56.269 --> 07:58.604
It was the gunshot wound
in the back that was fatal.

07:58.813 --> 08:00.523
The bullet matches
the weapon found at the scene.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.900
The gun registered
to one Clive Babineaux?

08:03.109 --> 08:04.861
You can't possibly
think Clive did this.

08:05.069 --> 08:08.906
Well, I'm just dispassionately
looking at the facts.

08:09.115 --> 08:11.742
Babineaux was romantically
involved with the deceased.

08:11.951 --> 08:13.619
She was killed with his gun.

08:13.828 --> 08:17.457
He has no alibi.
And here's the kicker.
The vic's phone.

08:17.665 --> 08:18.875
<i>This stops now, Regina.</i>

08:19.083 --> 08:20.626
<i>Don't call. Don't text.</i>

08:20.835 --> 08:22.378
<i>Don't show up at my place.</i>

08:22.587 --> 08:25.006
<i>If you continue to harass me
or anyone I care about,</i>

08:25.214 --> 08:27.425
<i>I promise,
this won't end well for you.</i>

08:27.633 --> 08:30.219
Now, can anyone in the class
tell me what that is?

08:30.428 --> 08:34.265
Huh? Uh, oh.
Why, it's motive,
Mr. Cavanaugh!

08:34.474 --> 08:37.351
He left the message one hour
before Regina was killed.

08:38.436 --> 08:40.438
If this case were any easier,

08:40.646 --> 08:42.190
I'd have slept
with it in college.

08:55.870 --> 08:57.705
So what do they really have?

08:57.914 --> 09:00.249
Nothing but a murder weapon
registered to Clive.

09:00.458 --> 09:03.753
And a recorded threat directed
at the victim from Clive.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.005
And so what
if he doesn't have an alibi?

09:06.214 --> 09:07.757
I don't have an alibi
for her murder, either.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.471
No. Wait. I do have an alibi.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.223
Witnesses, too.
Airtight, really.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.642
So we can cross you
off the list. That's good.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.018
I'm just gonna
eat this brain for fun.

09:19.227 --> 09:20.853
Clive doesn't even
need our help.

09:21.062 --> 09:22.647
Might as well plan
your wedding to Major

09:22.855 --> 09:24.482
while you're on this wedding
planner brain. Kill two birds.

09:26.067 --> 09:29.779
- I just had a thought.
- What?

09:29.987 --> 09:33.824
What if you have a vision of
having sex with Clive?

09:34.033 --> 09:35.159
You might see his O-face.

09:35.368 --> 09:37.203
Really?
That's where your mind goes?

09:37.411 --> 09:38.704
I bet it's super angry.

09:49.257 --> 09:51.050
So?

09:51.259 --> 09:52.343
Who did it?

09:54.804 --> 09:58.391
- Agent Bozzio.
- Ah, first names, please.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.268
Dale, uh...

10:00.476 --> 10:02.478
This is my boss,
Ravi Chakrabarti.

10:02.687 --> 10:03.604
Ravi... Dale.

10:04.939 --> 10:06.274
How's Clive doing?

10:06.482 --> 10:07.942
I only got to talk to him
for five minutes.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.152
They've had him in
interrogation most of the day.

10:10.361 --> 10:11.487
He wanted me to show you this.

10:11.696 --> 10:13.155
The, uh, dead girl,
what's her name?

10:13.364 --> 10:14.282
Regina Sumner.

10:15.575 --> 10:17.660
She left that on
my doorstep last night.

10:21.372 --> 10:23.874
It's worse than we thought.
Clive was married to the girl.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.127
He does always
blame the spouse.

10:26.335 --> 10:30.590
That's a mostly photoshopped
history of a mostly
fictional relationship.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.717
He only went out
with her a few times.

10:32.925 --> 10:35.344
The woman was
an obsessive stalker,
crazier than an outhouse rat.

10:35.553 --> 10:36.721
Oh, no, Liv.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.473
You okay?

10:41.892 --> 10:44.520
I, uh, just feel
something coming on.

10:44.729 --> 10:47.023
Maybe you should try to
go throw up or something?

10:47.231 --> 10:49.775
No. I've gotta be
strong for Clive.

10:52.111 --> 10:54.280
Wedding announcement.
Save the date.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.073
Wait. That doesn't
look photoshopped.

10:56.282 --> 10:58.242
- Oh, it's not.
- Clive plays piano?

10:58.451 --> 10:59.619
Beautifully. He's got
one in his living room.

10:59.827 --> 11:00.703
You've never been
to his place?

11:00.911 --> 11:02.163
Nope.

11:02.330 --> 11:04.040
Clive has a strict church
and state policy

11:04.248 --> 11:05.958
with regards to his work
and personal life.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.210
Clive cooks?

11:08.419 --> 11:10.296
Cajun cuisine mainly.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.089
His grandmother on
his father's side taught him.

11:12.298 --> 11:13.799
No! It can't be...

11:14.008 --> 11:17.470
Oh, yeah. Clive's
a huge <i>Game of Thrones</i> fan.

11:17.678 --> 11:18.721
You want to really
set him off?

11:18.929 --> 11:20.514
Yes, please.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.225
Ask him what
George R.R. Martin
is doing right now.

11:23.434 --> 11:25.728
We don't know this man at all.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.355
Maybe he is a murderer.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.273
We should check his basement
for human remains.

11:29.482 --> 11:30.608
Ravi...

11:30.816 --> 11:32.443
Oh, this one's
clearly photoshopped.

11:32.652 --> 11:33.778
Clive's hands aren't white.

11:33.986 --> 11:36.197
At this point,
anything is possible.

11:36.405 --> 11:39.283
Clive asked me to bring
this by, he thought it might
spark one of your, uh...

11:39.492 --> 11:41.035
- Visions?
- Yeah.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.620
Can you leave it with me?
They don't happen on command.

11:42.828 --> 11:45.873
I've gotta hand it over
to Detective Cavanaugh,

11:46.082 --> 11:47.875
or it might be
viewed as obstruction.

11:50.461 --> 11:51.545
Worth a shot.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.970
So, <i>Fatal Attraction</i> brain.
That's gonna be fun.

12:00.179 --> 12:02.098
I don't feel anything at all.

12:07.937 --> 12:11.315
Hey, would it be weird
if I got Minor
a tiny Seahawks jersey

12:11.524 --> 12:14.068
and on the back
it said, "Ruff L. Wilson"?

12:14.276 --> 12:16.153
Who's the bitch
using your shower?

12:16.362 --> 12:19.573
- Uh...
- Or did you suddenly switch
to Sinful Diva shampoo?

12:19.782 --> 12:21.534
"For the shine
that gets him to notice you"?

12:21.742 --> 12:23.369
Oh. That's Ravi's. Smell it.

12:25.538 --> 12:26.789
It does smell like Ravi.

12:27.623 --> 12:28.833
Are you okay?

12:29.041 --> 12:32.002
I'm going to plead
temporary insanity.

12:32.211 --> 12:34.130
Hey, a little jealousy
makes a guy feel wanted.

12:37.883 --> 12:38.968
Little late for a text,
isn't it?

12:40.511 --> 12:41.679
But let's not overplay it.

12:46.517 --> 12:49.019
<i>This isn't you, Liv.
It's the brain.</i>

12:49.228 --> 12:50.521
<i>You know this.</i>

12:50.730 --> 12:53.607
<i>Put the phone down
and get back in bed.</i>

12:53.816 --> 12:55.860
<i>You don't know
his pass code, anyway.</i>

12:57.278 --> 12:59.905
<i>Or maybe this is a sign.</i>

13:14.837 --> 13:16.130
Liv?

13:16.338 --> 13:18.048
Who's Rita?

13:18.257 --> 13:19.884
You went through my phone?

13:20.092 --> 13:21.761
"Yesterday was so hot.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.888
"Hope there were
no security cameras
in that elevator."

13:24.096 --> 13:26.223
- I can't believe that you...
- Here's another good one.

13:26.432 --> 13:28.684
"Three rounds in one night.
That's my kind of triathlon."

13:29.810 --> 13:32.188
Give me back my phone.

13:32.396 --> 13:34.815
"You up?" She sent that one
the night that you showed up
at my place begging for help.

13:35.024 --> 13:37.485
I'm so glad I could be
there for you when your booty
call fell through.

13:37.693 --> 13:39.528
Or did you come
to my place after?

13:39.737 --> 13:42.615
- That's not what happened.
- Oh, or should we
give Rita a call?

13:42.823 --> 13:44.533
Put her on speaker,
maybe get some confirmation.

13:44.742 --> 13:47.328
- Don't, don't do that.
- Answer the question!
Who's Rita?

13:47.495 --> 13:49.163
She was meaningless.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.582
All right, she,
she threw herself at me
during a real low point

13:51.791 --> 13:54.001
and it ended the moment
that we got back together.

13:54.168 --> 13:55.836
Wait,
I don't deserve this.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.509
It's this brain I'm on.

14:01.717 --> 14:05.054
Apparently the woman was
an unhinged stalker.
I didn't know when I ate it.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.934
Going through my phone
was not okay.

14:10.142 --> 14:11.352
It won't happen again.

14:12.937 --> 14:15.439
I can fight this.

14:15.648 --> 14:18.734
I'm already late for work.

14:50.975 --> 14:53.477
You have a safe
in your closet?

14:53.686 --> 14:55.145
- You're back.
- I didn't like how
we left things,

14:55.354 --> 14:56.522
so I came back to apologize.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.315
When did you get the safe?

14:58.524 --> 14:59.984
I got it when a giant zombie
broke into my place last year.

15:00.192 --> 15:01.277
Open it, please.

15:03.529 --> 15:04.947
- No.
- Why not?

15:05.155 --> 15:07.116
Because you just promised
you'd fight the brain.

15:08.409 --> 15:09.451
Prove you meant it.

15:11.704 --> 15:14.540
I meant it. I'm sorry.

15:22.590 --> 15:23.883
His nostrils are flaring.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.176
Tell me if fire actually
comes out of them.

15:26.385 --> 15:27.469
Can you read lips?

15:28.178 --> 15:30.180
I don't have to.

15:30.389 --> 15:32.641
When a cop makes the
front page of the newspaper
as a murder suspect,

15:34.768 --> 15:36.186
that cop's getting suspended.

15:36.395 --> 15:38.480
Don't worry
your pretty little head.

15:38.689 --> 15:40.190
Ravi and I? We've got this.

15:40.399 --> 15:41.984
- We do?
- You got what?

15:42.192 --> 15:44.194
This. You!
You're in good hands.

15:44.403 --> 15:45.571
Vision here. Vision there.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.364
Some good old-fashioned
police work.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.325
Bibbity bobbity boo.
You're cleared of all charges.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.619
No. Not happening.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.787
If you happen to have
a vision that solves the case,
take it to Cavanaugh.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.874
If they find you're out there
on your own poking around,

15:57.082 --> 15:58.083
we'll all go down.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.376
Like Robb Stark.

16:03.172 --> 16:04.131
We're gonna help.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.549
You want us flying blind,

16:05.758 --> 16:07.343
or maybe you wanna
open up, this once?

16:07.551 --> 16:09.136
Just give us
some basic details.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.723
How'd you and Regina meet?

16:12.932 --> 16:14.975
At a wedding a few months ago.
She was the wedding planner.

16:15.184 --> 16:17.227
We hit it off.
Went out a few times.

16:17.436 --> 16:21.315
She fell for you,
but you, big man,
couldn't be tied down.

16:21.523 --> 16:22.858
You broke her heart.

16:23.067 --> 16:24.860
Why? The intimacy?

16:25.069 --> 16:27.029
- No.
- I'm not talking about what
went on between the sheets.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.490
I'm talking about
emotional intimacy.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.283
Two people connecting.
Falling in...

16:31.492 --> 16:33.160
She was a badge bunny.

16:33.369 --> 16:35.704
- A what?
- A badge bunny.

16:35.913 --> 16:37.164
A woman who sleeps with cops.

16:37.373 --> 16:39.667
Something about the badge
turns them on.

16:39.875 --> 16:40.834
I have a badge.

16:42.336 --> 16:44.755
All she wanted to talk
about was my job.

16:44.964 --> 16:46.757
She wanted details
on the cases.

16:46.966 --> 16:50.928
She wanted me
wearing my holster
when we were, uh, intimate.

16:51.136 --> 16:52.388
She wanted to hold my gun.

16:52.930 --> 16:53.889
Mmm-mmm.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.935
That's when I ended things.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.895
And that's when things
got really crazy.

17:00.104 --> 17:01.605
Uh, phone calls in
the middle of the night.

17:01.814 --> 17:02.856
Emails. Texts.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.316
She wanted closure.

17:04.525 --> 17:08.612
Why is that so hard
for men to understand?

17:08.821 --> 17:11.490
- How'd she get your gun?
- Stolen from my place
the night before her murder.

17:11.699 --> 17:14.243
She wanted to have something
you touched against her skin.

17:14.451 --> 17:15.411
Whose side are you on?

17:15.619 --> 17:16.829
Babineaux.

17:17.037 --> 17:20.207
Let's see if taking your
badge away cheers me up.

17:22.251 --> 17:23.210
Come on.

17:26.130 --> 17:27.631
Regina was suing a client.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.508
She made it sound
like it was pretty ugly.

17:29.717 --> 17:32.219
I'd start there.

17:32.428 --> 17:36.432
If Cavanaugh hears anyone else
from the Seattle PD
is questioning witnesses,

17:36.640 --> 17:38.559
we'll all be collecting
unemployment together.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.688
<i>Che dothras,</i>

17:44.606 --> 17:46.400
<i>che drivos.</i>

17:46.608 --> 17:48.235
- What does that mean?
- He knows.

17:50.487 --> 17:53.282
Karma Cleaners & Alterations.
This is the place.

17:53.490 --> 17:56.076
Regina planned
the owner's wedding,
and then sued for unpaid fees.

17:56.285 --> 17:57.619
But remember,
we don't know that.

17:57.828 --> 17:58.954
All right, what's the plan?

17:59.163 --> 18:00.622
We'll wing it.
You ready to do this?

18:01.457 --> 18:02.833
Yes, and...

18:03.042 --> 18:04.334
And what?

18:04.543 --> 18:06.003
"Yes, and..."
It's the first rule of improv?

18:06.211 --> 18:08.630
It's what keeps
the scene moving forward.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.591
Try not to talk.
You willing to hold my hand?

18:10.799 --> 18:12.342
Yes. And...

18:15.179 --> 18:16.722
Hey there. How can I help you?

18:16.930 --> 18:20.476
I'm Julie Walker and
this tall drink of water
is my fiance.

18:21.769 --> 18:23.479
Shawarma Parachanchetabarka.

18:25.022 --> 18:26.523
We've just started
wedding planning.

18:26.732 --> 18:28.776
We're thinking
of hiring Regina Sumner,

18:28.984 --> 18:30.778
her assistant gave us
a list of references.

18:30.986 --> 18:33.864
Uma and Matthew Voss,
owners of Karma Cleaners,
were on it.

18:34.073 --> 18:36.158
Well, I'm Uma.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.285
They listed me as a reference?

18:38.494 --> 18:40.704
I guess nothing should
surprise me about that woman.

18:40.913 --> 18:43.207
Anyway, you're in luck.
She was murdered.

18:43.415 --> 18:44.583
No!

18:44.792 --> 18:46.460
That's terrible.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.212
My husband and I spent
our life savings
on that wedding,

18:48.420 --> 18:50.881
and Regina was
totally incompetent.

18:51.090 --> 18:53.133
We fired her
before the actual event,

18:53.342 --> 18:55.969
but she still showed up in
the middle of the reception,
drunk off her ass.

18:56.136 --> 19:00.224
Made a pass at my husband
and puked on my dress.

19:00.432 --> 19:03.185
Then she had the nerve
to sue us for unpaid services.

19:03.393 --> 19:04.353
That's awful.

19:05.395 --> 19:07.231
- Hey, honey.
- Hi.

19:07.439 --> 19:08.690
This is my husband, Matthew.

19:08.899 --> 19:11.568
This is Julie
and her fiance...

19:11.777 --> 19:12.861
Can you remind me
your name again?

19:13.904 --> 19:15.489
Yes, and...

19:15.697 --> 19:17.783
Everyone just
calls him Brando.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.035
Brando, I'm Matthew Voss.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.666
<i>Matthew. Or Mr. Voss.
Not Baby.</i>

19:25.874 --> 19:27.960
<i>- Not Sugar. Not Lover.</i>
<i>- Baby...</i>

19:28.168 --> 19:29.545
<i>You're sending
this to my wife?</i>

19:29.753 --> 19:31.964
<i>I told you, we're over.
We're done.</i>

19:34.758 --> 19:36.468
Uh...

19:36.677 --> 19:38.971
How'd you get away
with not buying your girl
a rock?

19:39.179 --> 19:40.597
Uh...

19:40.806 --> 19:42.683
I just... I'm picky.

19:42.850 --> 19:45.686
I want something
unique, memorable.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.312
Ooh, like your ring!

19:48.188 --> 19:49.815
Thank you.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.776
It was my grandmother's.
It's one of a kind.

19:52.985 --> 19:53.902
Aw.

19:58.532 --> 19:59.950
You be safe
out there, baby.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.959
Regina was having
an affair with Matthew.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.794
I knew it! That badge bunny!

20:11.003 --> 20:12.546
In my vision,
Matthew was holding

20:12.754 --> 20:14.423
a scrapbook that
looked just like Clive's,

20:14.631 --> 20:16.508
and he said
he couldn't believe
she'd send it to Uma.

20:16.717 --> 20:18.760
We know Clive didn't
kill his stalker,
but maybe Matthew did.

20:18.969 --> 20:21.513
Exactly. He was yelling
at Regina and then,
he tossed the scrapbook

20:21.722 --> 20:23.849
over a railing
covered in padlocks.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.101
That's Love Locks Bridge!
Couples put up locks

20:26.310 --> 20:27.686
as a symbol
of their everlasting love.

20:27.895 --> 20:28.854
We should
go find that scrapbook.

20:29.897 --> 20:31.565
Can I have my hand back now?

20:31.773 --> 20:32.816
Die with the con, Liv.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.948
No, it's Voss. V-O-S-S.

20:40.157 --> 20:41.325
He's a beat cop at the 12th.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.290
All morning?

20:49.958 --> 20:52.211
You're sure? Okay, thanks.

20:55.505 --> 20:57.633
- It was down there!
- Nicely done.

20:57.841 --> 21:00.260
Just the same as Clive's,
but with Matthew's face

21:00.469 --> 21:01.887
photoshopped
into the pictures.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.348
See? Another fake
save the date.

21:04.556 --> 21:05.474
Here.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.851
The same wedding photo.

21:08.060 --> 21:10.395
Most importantly,
no water damage.

21:10.604 --> 21:12.981
It was raining a few days ago,
so your vision
must have been recent.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.316
I think Matthew
could be our guy.

21:14.524 --> 21:15.943
- No. He can't.
- What? Why?

21:16.151 --> 21:18.111
I already called
the dispatcher
from the 12th precinct.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.156
Matthew was on a call
at the time of the murder.

21:21.365 --> 21:22.324
You could have led with that.

21:22.532 --> 21:24.618
Look, this photo again.

21:24.826 --> 21:27.788
Matthew's face
photoshopped onto
the same body as Clive's.

21:27.955 --> 21:29.373
So who is our original guy?

21:29.581 --> 21:32.459
I don't know. But I'll bet
his initials are W. P.

21:32.668 --> 21:34.836
- You had a vision?
- No.

21:35.045 --> 21:38.131
Etched on this padlock
with a heart. R-S plus C-B.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.634
Regina Sumner
plus Clive Babineaux.

21:40.842 --> 21:42.636
R-S plus M-V?

21:42.844 --> 21:44.805
Regina Sumner
and Matthew Voss.

21:45.013 --> 21:46.807
R-S plus W-P.

21:55.315 --> 21:59.987
So, it seems
Regina took N.W.A's
biggest hit literally.

22:00.195 --> 22:01.989
I ran the plates to the SUV

22:02.197 --> 22:04.449
and it belongs
to someone in the Seattle PD.

22:04.658 --> 22:05.951
It's an official
police vehicle.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.953
The badge bunny strikes again.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.538
- Who's our mystery cop?
- No clue.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.665
The Seattle PD
own a thousand SUVs,

22:11.873 --> 22:14.459
and there's no online record
as to which cop
drives which vehicle.

22:14.668 --> 22:16.003
Then it's another dead end.

22:16.211 --> 22:18.505
For the time being.
But then I asked myself...

22:20.424 --> 22:22.217
What if this car was parked
outside Major's all night,

22:22.426 --> 22:25.137
and I wanted to find out
who the nasty ho was
who owned it.

22:26.847 --> 22:28.890
"Friends at
seattlecyclers.com.

22:29.099 --> 22:31.226
"Last week during
the Chilly Hilly bike race,

22:31.435 --> 22:34.855
"the driver of a black SUV,
pissed because he had
to slow down for cyclists,

22:35.063 --> 22:37.232
"plowed through our group,
running us off the road.

22:37.441 --> 22:40.694
"Later, when we stopped
for lunch, the SUV doubled
back and ran over our bikes.

22:40.902 --> 22:43.947
"Below is his plate number.
If you see the vehicle,
tweet me its location.

22:44.156 --> 22:45.407
"He needs to be
taught a lesson."

22:47.034 --> 22:49.244
I'm impressed, and frightened.

22:49.453 --> 22:51.538
You don't
mess with Seattle cyclers.

22:51.747 --> 22:53.832
Hmm, or Liv Moore
on stalker brain.

22:59.713 --> 23:03.467
Oh, you like Major's post
about the state cutting
funding for homeless shelters.

23:03.675 --> 23:05.552
I see right through you, lady.

23:07.846 --> 23:09.264
Hey.

23:09.473 --> 23:10.599
Well, look who's
home for once.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.809
You slut!

23:15.145 --> 23:16.605
Um...

23:16.813 --> 23:18.982
What are you doing?

23:19.191 --> 23:21.985
Making a list of all the women
who comment or post
on Major's Facebook entries.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.112
This is bad, huh?

23:25.072 --> 23:27.240
It isn't good. Why?

23:27.449 --> 23:29.034
I started out
just looking for one name.

23:29.242 --> 23:31.161
But once
I started poking around,

23:31.370 --> 23:33.997
I started noticing
all these chicks throwing
themselves at my man.

23:35.957 --> 23:38.043
Oh, "So true, Major.
Violence is bad."

23:38.251 --> 23:39.586
"Keep fighting
the good fight."

23:39.753 --> 23:41.630
Classic whore line.

23:41.838 --> 23:44.257
"A bunch of us
are going out for karaoke.
You should come with."

23:44.466 --> 23:46.385
Toss your
panties at him, Jezebel.

23:47.469 --> 23:48.720
Wow!

23:50.430 --> 23:52.474
Who were
you originally looking for?

23:52.682 --> 23:56.686
Some slut named Rita.
She sent him
all these desperate texts.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.105
"Come do me, Major."

23:59.189 --> 24:00.273
He showed these to you?

24:00.482 --> 24:01.733
I found them on his phone.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.779
Bold move.

24:05.987 --> 24:07.656
Did you confront him?

24:07.864 --> 24:09.908
He said
this desperate Rita chick
threw herself at him

24:10.117 --> 24:11.410
when he
was at a real low point.

24:14.371 --> 24:15.330
What am I doing?

24:16.706 --> 24:18.959
This isn't me.
I'm not this girl.

24:19.167 --> 24:20.752
Major
doesn't deserve this.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.047
I don't know.

24:24.256 --> 24:26.466
Sounds to me like
he deserves to be punished.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.977
All the responses
to my cycling post

24:37.185 --> 24:39.688
are just people
sharing their own
horror stories about drivers.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.273
It hasn't even been 24 hours.

24:41.481 --> 24:44.901
Finally. Some friendly faces.

24:45.110 --> 24:46.987
I just met with my union rep.

24:47.195 --> 24:51.241
Good news,
if I'm convicted of murder,
I won't have to pay dues.

24:51.450 --> 24:53.869
I brought dinner, po' boys
if anyone's interested.

24:54.077 --> 24:56.621
Yes! Don't leave town, yeah.

24:56.830 --> 25:00.167
Po' boys? Are those
from that Cajun place
near your house?

25:00.375 --> 25:02.419
Yeah. You two
love that place, right?

25:02.627 --> 25:06.214
We do! We should
all go there some time.

25:06.423 --> 25:08.758
It's really
more of a takeout joint.

25:08.967 --> 25:09.885
Oh.

25:11.928 --> 25:13.763
What's it called?
You never told us.

25:15.265 --> 25:17.601
Uh... Grandma's.

25:18.935 --> 25:20.562
Yeah.

25:20.770 --> 25:22.939
I'm pleased
to see the two of you
still work here.

25:23.148 --> 25:26.485
It means you haven't
gotten yourselves suspended
for doing anything silly.

25:26.693 --> 25:27.611
Define silly.

25:27.819 --> 25:29.112
Mouth on fire!

25:29.321 --> 25:30.864
Oh, Sorry.
That one was for Liv.

25:39.623 --> 25:43.877
Hmm. Mine's a little
uninspiring. How's yours?

25:46.129 --> 25:49.090
I'm neither overwhelmed,
or underwhelmed.
I guess I'm whelmed.

25:49.299 --> 25:50.342
Hmm.

25:50.550 --> 25:51.843
Grandma must
have lost her touch.

25:54.471 --> 25:56.473
All right.
I hope the two of you
have enjoyed yourselves

25:56.681 --> 25:59.309
and the last two
Grandma's po' boys
you'll ever consume.

25:59.518 --> 26:00.352
No!

26:00.560 --> 26:02.479
Why did you keep it a secret?

26:02.687 --> 26:04.147
You figured <i>Shaft</i> never
cooked for his friends,
so neither could you?

26:04.356 --> 26:06.525
It's adorable.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.485
And there it is.
Need I say more?

26:08.693 --> 26:10.570
Yeah, I figured
I'd find you down here.

26:11.905 --> 26:13.490
So. Who took it?

26:14.991 --> 26:16.826
- Took what?
- The evidence from my desk.

26:17.035 --> 26:19.162
I didn't take anything
from your desk, Cavanaugh.

26:19.371 --> 26:20.539
Neither did we.

26:20.747 --> 26:23.041
Oh, bummer.

26:23.250 --> 26:27.337
I was hoping we could have
an open and honest discussion
and then maybe, hug it out.

26:27.546 --> 26:30.090
Exactly what sort of evidence
do you believe we've stolen?

26:31.007 --> 26:31.967
Nice try.

26:33.510 --> 26:34.761
Whatever.

26:34.928 --> 26:37.389
It's your careers.
Enjoy civilian life.

26:38.223 --> 26:39.182
Or jail.

26:45.814 --> 26:47.566
What did I tell you
about making this
worse for me?

26:47.774 --> 26:49.651
I have no idea
what he was talking about.

26:49.859 --> 26:51.903
Everything we've done
so far has been
completely by the book.

26:55.865 --> 26:58.368
Ah! Jackpot! We've got a hit.

26:58.577 --> 27:03.748
I'm gonna need a slim jim,
a black hoodie
and a head lamp.

27:03.957 --> 27:06.209
- What exactly...
- The less you know,
the better.

27:11.923 --> 27:14.092
Clive.

27:14.301 --> 27:16.386
What's George R. R. Martin
up to right now?

27:18.805 --> 27:19.848
Not writing.

27:40.368 --> 27:41.494
Bingo!

28:04.601 --> 28:07.562
Come on. Come on. Who are you?

28:29.834 --> 28:31.586
Chief Walt Price speaking.

28:31.795 --> 28:35.507
<i>It's Detective Cavanaugh here.
I'm afraid I've got
some bad news.</i>

28:35.715 --> 28:38.802
<i>That evidence
I told you about?
The scrapbook?</i>

28:39.010 --> 28:42.055
<i>It's gone missing.
Babineaux must've
gotten to it.</i>

28:42.263 --> 28:44.557
Damn it, Cavanaugh!
How the hell did
you let that happen?

28:44.766 --> 28:46.184
<i>It was in my desk,
someone could've...</i>

28:46.393 --> 28:47.852
You're killing me, Cavanaugh.

28:48.061 --> 28:50.271
If that scrapbook gets out,
it will end my marriage.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.815
Call me when you've found it.

29:02.826 --> 29:04.786
You're in
a world of trouble,
young lady.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.213
Get comfortable.

29:15.422 --> 29:16.506
Chief of Police says, uh,
you're gonna be with us
a while.

29:16.715 --> 29:17.841
Fresh meat!

29:19.718 --> 29:21.845
Um... I have
some dietary requirements.

29:22.053 --> 29:23.346
Can a doctor
bring me my meals?

29:24.055 --> 29:25.598
Sure.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.642
When would you like
your masseuse to swing by?

29:27.851 --> 29:30.437
Yo, guard.
Where's my masseuse?

29:30.645 --> 29:33.231
I'm guessing a private cell
is out of the question?

29:34.899 --> 29:36.609
It's a safety thing.

29:36.776 --> 29:38.236
You'll be fine.

29:38.445 --> 29:39.821
I know I'll be fine.

29:42.866 --> 29:45.326
Hey!
You talk to my PD
about my case, yet?

29:45.535 --> 29:48.204
I've got rights.
Cops busted me for weed,

29:48.413 --> 29:50.623
but I've been arrested
for that before.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.667
That's double jeopardy!

29:52.876 --> 29:56.254
You can't charge me
for the same crime twice!
This is America!

30:06.765 --> 30:07.891
How are you feeling?

30:08.099 --> 30:09.100
Hungry.

30:09.309 --> 30:11.352
I hadn't eaten
since my first helping.

30:11.561 --> 30:14.689
Channeling a crazy stalker
hasn't exactly been
good for my love life.

30:14.898 --> 30:16.024
They won't let me
bring you any...

30:17.108 --> 30:18.443
- ...sustenance.
- I know.

30:18.651 --> 30:19.861
You're not getting out
until Monday morning.

30:20.069 --> 30:21.613
Chief W. P.
is making sure of that.

30:21.821 --> 30:23.698
They've made it
pretty clear to me.

30:23.907 --> 30:26.493
Major is down in Ellensburg
at a basketball tournament
with his team.

30:26.701 --> 30:27.786
He hasn't
returned my call yet.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.704
- Don't tell him I'm in here.
- Liv.

30:29.913 --> 30:32.874
There's nothing Major can do.
He'll be back tomorrow night.

30:33.082 --> 30:33.958
He won't be happy with us.

30:34.167 --> 30:35.585
- Please.
- Okay.

30:35.794 --> 30:38.338
Hmm, got some interesting
news back from the lab.

30:38.505 --> 30:41.841
Turns out there were
two different blood types
at the crime scene.

30:42.050 --> 30:43.635
One of them
belonged to Regina.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.220
They're going
to take blood from Clive
to see if it's a match.

30:45.428 --> 30:46.596
- It won't be.
- No.

30:46.805 --> 30:48.139
But it won't
necessarily exonerate him.

30:49.307 --> 30:51.810
We get eight more minutes.

30:54.562 --> 30:55.980
What do you
want to talk about?

30:56.189 --> 30:58.691
Oh, what's the best
American album of all time?

30:58.900 --> 31:00.777
I say, it's <i>Pet Sounds,</i>
by the Beach Boys.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.695
Can we just sit here?

31:02.904 --> 31:05.824
Eight minutes of silence is
just what the doctor ordered.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.625
Weed's legal in this state.

31:15.834 --> 31:18.545
In case you ain't heard,
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

31:18.753 --> 31:23.132
It's a war on the poor.
I bet if I had a real lawyer,
instead of one of those,

31:23.341 --> 31:25.051
"One will be appointed to you"
public defenders,

31:25.218 --> 31:27.178
ya'll all be
singing a different tune.

31:27.387 --> 31:28.972
Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up.

31:29.180 --> 31:33.977
Six ounces! Six ounces!
And my doctor prescribed it.

31:34.185 --> 31:35.728
Ferguson! Ferguson!

31:35.937 --> 31:38.648
Go girl, you tell 'em.

31:38.857 --> 31:41.943
Oh, baby. We need
to get you out of there.

31:42.151 --> 31:45.029
12 more hours. I can make it.

31:45.238 --> 31:46.698
I worry about you.

31:46.906 --> 31:50.159
Well, I'm likely
unemployed now, so...

31:50.368 --> 31:53.621
Silver lining,
my inner stalker
has left the building.

31:53.830 --> 31:56.040
You can invite
some girls over tonight.

31:56.249 --> 31:58.877
Play some Twister.
See if I care.

31:59.085 --> 32:01.629
These girls I'm inviting over?
I'm warning you,

32:01.838 --> 32:04.757
they're basically
adult film stars.

32:04.966 --> 32:06.426
And not even
the under contract ones.

32:06.634 --> 32:08.720
I'm talking
the anything goes kind.

32:10.263 --> 32:11.389
I'll be here
when they let you out.

32:14.601 --> 32:15.560
I can't wait.

32:31.910 --> 32:32.994
Olivia Moore?

32:34.662 --> 32:35.622
You've been released.

32:40.293 --> 32:41.669
There she is!

32:42.795 --> 32:43.880
Oh.

32:44.088 --> 32:45.757
Yeah,
that smoothie is for you.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.884
They let you out
a few hours
earlier than expected.

32:48.092 --> 32:49.761
Major's all the way
across town, so I offered
to pick you up.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.971
Plus, I knew
you'd be, uh, peckish.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.640
So much better. Thank you.

32:53.848 --> 32:55.266
Oh, who am I...

32:55.475 --> 32:57.143
Oh, all we had on hand
was leftover Regina.

32:57.352 --> 32:58.853
I figured it was better
than starting the Apocalypse.

33:01.064 --> 33:02.982
To you and me, maybe.

33:03.191 --> 33:04.692
Not sure Major
will feel the same.

33:08.112 --> 33:11.032
I tore this
out of the scrapbook I found
in the back of Price's car.

33:11.240 --> 33:14.702
I only had
a few seconds so I just
went for the back page.

33:14.911 --> 33:17.330
See? It's Price
in the original shot.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.208
Hold on.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.628
Regina's ring. Is that...

33:23.836 --> 33:24.879
What?

33:26.422 --> 33:28.675
Unique? Memorable?

33:28.883 --> 33:30.510
One of a kind.

33:30.718 --> 33:32.804
Let's go solve this case.

33:33.012 --> 33:34.722
Come on, bossman.
Two more.

33:44.816 --> 33:48.653
Yeah we get it,
we get it, big boy.
You're working hard.

33:48.861 --> 33:51.489
Hate to break it to you,
you being the owner
of the company and all, but,

33:51.698 --> 33:54.158
all that sugar
and caffeine in energy drinks
just makes you crash.

33:54.367 --> 33:58.871
Super Max
is no energy drink, my friend.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.208
It's a revolution
in liquid form.

34:02.417 --> 34:04.544
Right.

34:04.752 --> 34:06.796
Max it out.

34:07.005 --> 34:09.966
Why? You were
burnt out on a half stack.

34:10.174 --> 34:13.052
I got Super Max coursing
through my veins, my friend.

34:13.261 --> 34:16.681
I'm TNT. I'm dynomite.

34:17.807 --> 34:18.891
All right.

34:20.852 --> 34:23.062
As your trainer,
I can't recommend that...

34:32.989 --> 34:35.783
Look in my bag.

34:35.992 --> 34:40.621
Those are for you.
In case you need a leg up
during your night job.

34:40.830 --> 34:42.623
I'll give it a try.

34:42.832 --> 34:45.334
Whoo! Ah!

34:45.543 --> 34:49.088
If you take nothing else
away from our time together,
let it be this...

34:53.217 --> 34:56.095
Grunt again! Grunt again!

34:57.305 --> 34:59.348
Grunt again, you big baby!

35:10.318 --> 35:12.737
Hi. Is the owner around?

35:12.945 --> 35:14.906
I'm the co-owner.
Something I can help you with?

35:15.114 --> 35:16.616
Uh, we're looking
for Uma Voss.

35:16.824 --> 35:19.994
Oh yeah, that's my sister.
She's in the back. I'm Karl.

35:20.203 --> 35:22.872
- Karma Cleaners. Karl, Uma.
- You get it?

35:23.081 --> 35:25.333
Hey there,
more wedding questions?

35:25.541 --> 35:26.667
The devil's in the details.

35:28.086 --> 35:29.378
What happened to your neck?

35:30.630 --> 35:32.673
I, uh, got in an accident.

35:32.882 --> 35:34.967
What kind of accident?

35:35.176 --> 35:36.427
Who wants to know?

35:36.636 --> 35:39.013
Senior medical examiner,
Ravi Chakrabarti.

35:39.222 --> 35:42.016
We're investigating
the murder of Regina Sumner.

35:42.225 --> 35:45.645
Any idea why we have
several photographs of
your murdered wedding planner

35:45.853 --> 35:47.855
wearing your engagement ring?

35:48.064 --> 35:51.067
It seems the killer was
wounded during the attack.

35:51.275 --> 35:53.277
We'd love to get some
blood samples
from the two of you.

35:53.486 --> 35:55.822
You know,
just to cross you off
the list of suspects.

36:02.078 --> 36:04.497
Your brother
seems to have some place
he needs to be.

36:16.050 --> 36:17.218
Come on. Come on.

36:30.064 --> 36:32.650
Here's what
I don't understand.

36:32.859 --> 36:35.820
You found out
about your husband's affair
a week before the wedding.

36:36.028 --> 36:37.822
And that's why you fired her.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.907
But you married him anyway.

36:41.325 --> 36:42.952
So what happened?

36:43.161 --> 36:44.912
You get
the scrapbook in the mail.

36:45.121 --> 36:47.540
All these photos of Regina
cavorting with your husband,

36:47.748 --> 36:50.251
and you decide,
that bitch has got to die?

36:50.459 --> 36:52.503
Why not kill your husband?

36:52.712 --> 36:54.172
He's the one who promised
in front of friends and family
to be faithful.

36:54.380 --> 36:57.925
He was faithful.
That scrapbook was fiction.

36:58.134 --> 37:00.803
We know they had an affair.

37:01.012 --> 37:03.806
They slept together
a couple times.

37:04.015 --> 37:07.268
But it was before the wedding.
Matthew confessed to it.

37:07.476 --> 37:08.519
He's been faithful ever since.

37:08.728 --> 37:10.313
So why'd you kill her?

37:10.521 --> 37:12.481
The why is easy.

37:12.690 --> 37:15.776
Regina slept
with her husband, stole her
grandmother's wedding ring,

37:15.985 --> 37:20.114
filed a lawsuit against her,
then sent her a scrapbook
rubbing her nose in it.

37:20.323 --> 37:21.282
I didn't kill her.

37:22.742 --> 37:24.827
Fair enough.

37:25.036 --> 37:26.454
Why did you
have your brother kill her?

37:28.206 --> 37:29.749
It's his blood
at the crime scene.

37:29.957 --> 37:31.292
He's not talking, though.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.169
That's a loyal brother.

37:33.377 --> 37:35.713
You gonna let him
spend the rest
of his life in prison?

37:39.300 --> 37:42.637
I didn't know
Regina was the one
who stole my engagement ring.

37:42.845 --> 37:45.598
I only found out
after she sent me
that scrapbook.

37:47.850 --> 37:50.102
The plan was never
to kill her.

37:50.311 --> 37:55.399
<i>I just wanted to scare
her, get her to stop harassing
me and get my ring back.</i>

37:57.777 --> 38:00.488
<i>Karl was going
to slap her around,
put the fear of God in her.</i>

38:00.696 --> 38:02.156
<i>But then,
she pulls out a knife.</i>

38:02.365 --> 38:04.325
Whoever you are,
you messed
with the wrong woman.

38:06.202 --> 38:07.954
<i>She was
going to kill my brother.</i>

38:10.414 --> 38:11.958
<i>But you returned
to her body</i>

38:12.166 --> 38:15.878
long enough to pull your ring
off Regina's dead body.

38:16.087 --> 38:18.506
You sure
you want her badge?

38:18.714 --> 38:21.509
That's a lot of police work
for an assistant M.E.

38:21.717 --> 38:23.678
All's well
that ends well, right?

38:24.428 --> 38:26.472
Confession.

38:26.681 --> 38:29.642
No police involvement.
No one needs to know
about that third scrapbook.

38:33.229 --> 38:36.440
Hmm.

38:36.649 --> 38:41.279
Yeah, well,
you know what they say,
happy wife, happy life.

38:48.869 --> 38:50.705
Get it all down.

38:50.913 --> 38:53.416
The length
of your brother's sentence
probably depends on it.

39:01.048 --> 39:02.508
That guy you came in with,

39:04.051 --> 39:05.344
is he really your fiance?

39:08.431 --> 39:09.390
Smart.

39:11.976 --> 39:14.020
Every man cheats.

39:14.228 --> 39:15.563
They can't help themselves.

39:21.027 --> 39:24.363
Wait till you see
the pictures of the kids
with their trophies.

39:27.325 --> 39:29.785
What're you doing, Liv?

39:29.994 --> 39:32.621
There's something in there
that's going to break
my heart. I can feel it.

39:35.458 --> 39:38.085
I thought this brain
was wearing off.

39:38.294 --> 39:40.296
I was starving
when I got out of jail,

39:40.504 --> 39:42.131
and stalker brain
was all we had on hand.

39:44.091 --> 39:47.136
I know you're in there.
Somewhere.

39:48.304 --> 39:49.513
How do we fix this?

39:49.722 --> 39:51.015
You open the safe.

39:51.223 --> 39:52.600
You promised you'd fight it.

39:52.808 --> 39:54.935
I tried and I lost.

39:55.144 --> 39:56.604
I'm begging you.
Open the safe.

40:17.249 --> 40:19.877
My engagement ring.

40:20.086 --> 40:23.464
I thought for sure
you'd sold that
when I gave it back to you.

40:23.672 --> 40:27.635
I couldn't stand
the idea of anyone else
ever wearing it.

40:27.843 --> 40:31.597
Besides,
I never gave up hope
that you'd want it back.
