00:00.937 --> 00:03.458
Welcome to "Everlasting."

00:03.459 --> 00:06.928
Chet Wilton... creator of "Everlasting"...
big kahuna.

00:06.962 --> 00:08.930
You're very lucky that your little stunt

00:08.964 --> 00:10.698
got me boo-yah ratings last season.

00:10.733 --> 00:13.034
Yeah, Jeremy, I'm sorry that I, um...

00:13.068 --> 00:14.836
That you disappeared without saying a word?

00:14.870 --> 00:16.605
Saw that you and Lizzie got back together.

00:16.639 --> 00:18.592
She's my fiancÃ©e.

00:18.593 --> 00:20.974
- I called, Rach.
- Yeah.

00:21.009 --> 00:22.280
Mary.

00:22.281 --> 00:24.178
I'm the old... Old, desperate one.

00:24.212 --> 00:25.912
Her husband was physically abusive.

00:25.947 --> 00:27.548
<i>Hit the kid, too, broke her arm.</i>

00:27.582 --> 00:29.916
Well, what we need you to do
is talk about being a virgin.

00:31.753 --> 00:33.654
I think I'm a little out of my league.

00:33.688 --> 00:35.087
Are you kidding me?

00:35.122 --> 00:37.257
You're the most attractive person here.

00:37.291 --> 00:39.959
Chet stole "Everlasting" from both of us.

00:39.993 --> 00:41.461
It's your word against his.

00:41.495 --> 00:44.464
Well, unless you were to find
your original look book.

00:44.498 --> 00:47.504
You have taken everything from me.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.090
Not anymore.

00:50.366 --> 00:52.638
Some people think it's old-fashioned

00:52.672 --> 00:55.006
to ask a girl's family for
her hand in marriage.

00:55.041 --> 00:59.134
But here at "Everlasting,"
chivalry is not dead.

01:20.932 --> 01:23.568
So, in the spirit of true courtship,

01:23.602 --> 01:26.469
Adam will be going home with
one lucky lady this week

01:26.504 --> 01:27.837
to meet her family in hopes

01:27.871 --> 01:30.039
of taking their relationship
to the next level.

01:30.074 --> 01:31.508
Adam.

01:31.509 --> 01:32.842
Ladies, I wish I could go home

01:32.876 --> 01:34.344
with each and every one of you.

01:34.378 --> 01:36.979
But, um  no, seriously,

01:37.014 --> 01:39.382
I, um... I plan on taking this serious step

01:39.417 --> 01:42.118
with someone who I haven't
got to know very well

01:42.152 --> 01:45.020
but who has definitely piqued my curiosity.

01:45.054 --> 01:46.589
Faith.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.572
Hey.

01:51.573 --> 01:54.263
Nice job, lady. How did you
get him to pick Faith?

01:54.297 --> 01:56.198
That's some toddler-level
reverse psychology.

01:56.233 --> 01:57.371
Yeah, I told him to cut Faith,

01:57.372 --> 01:58.900
- and so he picked her.
- Aww.

01:58.935 --> 02:01.969
You know, who knew horse-face
was gonna be a crowd favorite?

02:02.003 --> 02:06.608
So  let's give them
some hard-core Americana.

02:06.642 --> 02:08.142
What are we doing?

02:08.175 --> 02:11.145
Okay, so I was thinking about
a sweet, little mini rodeo

02:11.179 --> 02:12.547
followed up by a church dance...

02:12.581 --> 02:14.349
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're
working way too hard.

02:14.383 --> 02:16.283
Screw the rodeo and just
get your "woof woof"

02:16.317 --> 02:17.351
to lose it to the big guy.

02:17.385 --> 02:18.785
Yeah, but she hasn't even admitted

02:18.819 --> 02:20.086
that she's a virgin yet, so...

02:20.121 --> 02:23.022
Well, then get her to. Come on, Goldy.

02:23.057 --> 02:27.227
It's 10k off your debt if you
can pop her cherry in Dixie.

02:46.079 --> 02:50.782
Now the rest of you ladies will
<i>be making video invitations</i>

02:50.816 --> 02:52.317
<i>explaining to Adam</i>

02:52.351 --> 02:54.519
<i>why you would like him to meet your family.</i>

02:54.553 --> 02:57.584
Mary's a freaking robot
with that creepy smile.

02:57.585 --> 02:59.026
I'm surprised she can feel <i>anything</i>

02:59.027 --> 03:01.793
with all the mood stabilizers she's on.

03:01.827 --> 03:06.030
She's bipolar, and she has
PTSD from the domestic abuse.

03:06.064 --> 03:07.314
- Can I see that?
- Yeah.

03:07.315 --> 03:09.716
Shia, I need you all over

03:09.717 --> 03:11.608
- those video invitations today.
- Yeah.

03:11.609 --> 03:13.284
I can cover Rachel's
girls while she's gone.

03:13.285 --> 03:16.560
You're not gonna be too busy trying to get
your entire head up Chet's asshole?

03:16.561 --> 03:19.696
Nah. I'm a born multi-tasker.

03:19.730 --> 03:22.694
All right, let's go, people!
Rachel? A word?

03:22.695 --> 03:24.800
- I'm worried about you, hon.
- Why?

03:24.834 --> 03:28.198
Well, you're about to go on your
first overnight trip with Jeremy.

03:28.199 --> 03:30.072
Right. Yeah, I-I'll be fine.

03:30.107 --> 03:32.374
Listen, I-I-I just want you

03:32.409 --> 03:34.786
to keep making good decisions for yourself.

03:34.787 --> 03:36.900
Giving into him, in particular,

03:36.901 --> 03:39.215
kind of destabilized you last time. Mexico?

03:39.216 --> 03:41.262
I remember. Yeah, I remember.
I understand. I got it.

03:41.263 --> 03:44.054
A-And if you could stay away
from the booze on the road.

03:44.055 --> 03:45.636
Makes us horny.

03:45.637 --> 03:47.722
Got it. Thanks!

03:47.723 --> 03:49.302
You want to walk me through
why you did the opposite

03:49.337 --> 03:50.761
of what I asked you to do?

03:50.762 --> 03:52.029
Because I'm not your meat puppet.

03:52.063 --> 03:55.400
Wow. It's gonna be a fun weekend.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.634
Try not to fight with your
boyfriend the whole time, okay?

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
Adam.

04:00.434 --> 04:01.834
Hey.

04:01.868 --> 04:03.135
There is actually one more thing

04:03.170 --> 04:04.671
I might ask you to do for me this week.

04:04.705 --> 04:06.972
But this one, I swear it's
gonna be right up your alley.

04:07.007 --> 04:08.474
- Up my alley, really?
- Yeah.

04:08.509 --> 04:09.676
I'll just wait...

04:11.478 --> 04:13.613
Holy crap!

04:13.647 --> 04:14.980
I cannot wait for you to see Gran's ranch.

04:15.015 --> 04:16.447
I know. I can't wait.
It's gonna be so good!

04:16.482 --> 04:18.283
Hey, guys, time out, guys.

04:18.317 --> 04:20.151
Time out.

04:20.185 --> 04:21.420
Now let's go have a conversation.

04:21.454 --> 04:22.354
- I'll talk to you later.
- All right.

04:22.388 --> 04:23.254
Let's go chat, okay?

04:23.289 --> 04:25.190
Ooh, a chat. A chat!

04:25.224 --> 04:27.392
I'm not even supposed
to be telling you this,

04:27.427 --> 04:30.261
but the audience has been
feeling a ton of heat

04:30.296 --> 04:32.297
building between you and Adam.

04:32.331 --> 04:33.631
Really? Come on.

04:33.665 --> 04:35.666
Why do you think he asked you on this date?

04:35.701 --> 04:37.568
Bringing him home to meet your family?

04:37.602 --> 04:38.936
Hey, that's a big step.

04:38.970 --> 04:40.971
It might also be

04:41.005 --> 04:43.407
the perfect, like, most magical time

04:43.442 --> 04:47.611
to let your relationship evolve,
you know, in a physical way.

04:47.646 --> 04:50.647
- Rachel, you know I can't.
- No, listen.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.515
I know that's a really big
deal for you, you know,

04:52.550 --> 04:54.884
but I'm just saying that Adam...
He's like a really great guy.

04:54.918 --> 04:57.186
Right, he's super-sweet, crazy-hot,

04:57.221 --> 04:59.823
and that's why you came here,
to try new things, right?

04:59.857 --> 05:02.492
Yeah, I guess.

05:02.526 --> 05:06.178
Can I think about it?

05:06.179 --> 05:08.250
Of course, sweetie, come on. You're crazy.

05:08.251 --> 05:09.508
I just... I would never want you

05:09.509 --> 05:11.279
to do anything that doesn't feel right.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.168
I'm just saying that I think

05:13.202 --> 05:14.803
Adam's been connected to you since day one,

05:14.804 --> 05:17.526
and if I were you, I'd want
him to, take my flower.

05:19.542 --> 05:21.209
All right, sweetie, I'll see you soon.

05:28.016 --> 05:30.918
My gosh! Hi, guys!

05:34.189 --> 05:37.658
Come here, my sweet, little
tater, and hug my neck.

05:37.693 --> 05:39.394
Hi, Gran.

05:39.428 --> 05:40.594
Yes.

05:41.796 --> 05:43.196
And who's this nice, young man?

05:43.230 --> 05:44.564
Adam Cromwell.

05:44.599 --> 05:46.266
Thank you so much for
inviting me into your home.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.967
And these are for you.

05:48.002 --> 05:49.202
Thank you.

05:49.236 --> 05:51.934
Ooh, Adam, this is my best friend, Amy.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.076
Hi.

05:53.077 --> 05:54.841
- Welcome to Mississippi.
- Thank you.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.310
Would you push me inside, young man?

05:57.344 --> 05:59.077
Sure, yeah.

05:59.112 --> 06:02.448
Now relax and enjoy the day, sweetheart.

06:02.482 --> 06:05.584
You're in God's country now.

06:05.619 --> 06:08.788
Hey, Gran looks great.

06:08.822 --> 06:10.556
Thank you for taking care of her.

06:10.590 --> 06:11.857
Has she been easy?

06:11.892 --> 06:13.426
Mostly.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.286
Gosh.

06:15.287 --> 06:17.583
I'm shocked that I'm still here.

06:17.584 --> 06:20.268
Okay, well, Adam kissed you in Napa.

06:20.302 --> 06:21.866
What more do you want?

06:21.901 --> 06:23.367
Who else has he kissed?

06:23.402 --> 06:25.403
You know? I'm sorry.

06:25.438 --> 06:28.339
I...I just miss my kid.
I'm too old for this.

06:28.373 --> 06:29.674
No, only 'cause you're acting old.

06:29.708 --> 06:30.942
You're not in menopause, Mary.

06:30.976 --> 06:33.143
You're hot as hell, like stunning.

06:33.177 --> 06:35.312
Thank you.

06:35.346 --> 06:38.659
Bathroom's on the left, hon!

06:57.601 --> 07:01.303
Be in your business.
You're better than that.

07:03.974 --> 07:06.407
How could you not think that?

07:06.442 --> 07:10.779
Amy, I'm sorry. Look...

07:10.813 --> 07:12.681
Are we done? 'Cause...

07:12.715 --> 07:14.015
Hey, hey.

07:14.049 --> 07:16.751
Um, I noticed that you
haven't been drinking.

07:16.786 --> 07:19.387
Are you like an alcoholic or something?

07:19.421 --> 07:22.075
No, Shia, I don't drink.

07:22.076 --> 07:23.984
Those are two very different things.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.058
Okay, and I respect that.

07:25.093 --> 07:27.862
But, you know, maybe make an exception.

07:27.896 --> 07:31.131
Two or five margaritas
always help <i>me</i> sparkle.

07:31.165 --> 07:34.201
I-I know that there is
another Mary in there...

07:34.235 --> 07:35.469
The <i>real</i> Mary.

07:35.504 --> 07:37.872
We just have to find her and let her shine.

07:37.906 --> 07:39.473
Okay. Thanks.

07:39.507 --> 07:41.908
Or you get dumped on national television

07:41.942 --> 07:43.409
for being a dull, dead-eyed loser.

07:43.443 --> 07:45.177
You think that's good for your kid to see?

07:45.212 --> 07:48.014
You get your hands off of me.

07:56.056 --> 07:57.856
Before we begin, I'd like to make sure

07:57.891 --> 08:00.893
that my clients understand what a
suit like this really entails.

08:00.927 --> 08:03.729
Well  we are
not your clients yet.

08:03.763 --> 08:05.030
Exactly.

08:05.064 --> 08:07.198
We talked about this. She gets it.

08:07.233 --> 08:10.235
Look, I just don't want to get
that weird kind of cancer

08:10.269 --> 08:11.300
that people get from being bitter,

08:11.301 --> 08:14.100
and letting Chet take credit for
my ideas is gonna give me that.

08:14.101 --> 08:16.841
So, let's sue the bastard.

08:16.875 --> 08:18.643
Okay, show me what you got.

08:49.739 --> 08:53.108
Wow. This is it?

08:53.142 --> 08:54.543
What?

08:54.578 --> 08:57.379
No, it's proof-positive that
the show was Quinn's idea.

08:57.413 --> 09:00.415
No, all this proves is that
you developed <i>something,</i>

09:00.450 --> 09:02.651
possibly with Chet, while
you were under his employ.

09:02.686 --> 09:04.053
And intellectual property suits

09:04.087 --> 09:05.653
are almost impossible in Reality TV.

09:05.688 --> 09:07.655
Okay, you think I don't know that?

09:07.690 --> 09:08.823
Give it back.

09:08.857 --> 09:10.758
Thank you.

09:10.793 --> 09:12.526
Wait.

09:12.561 --> 09:14.896
Is it true you and Chet are connected

09:14.930 --> 09:18.499
on more than just a... professional level?

09:19.434 --> 09:21.668
What are you implying?

09:21.703 --> 09:26.555
I'm implying that we may have
another way to make a case.

09:57.737 --> 10:01.539
Okay, so why don't you just
tell me about your...

10:01.573 --> 10:03.775
Your physical relationship
with Adam so far?

10:03.809 --> 10:07.833
My physical relationship with
Adam has been hot and sexy

10:07.834 --> 10:10.949
and, um... he held my
hand on the way up here.

10:10.983 --> 10:13.050
I thought that was very romantic of him.

10:13.084 --> 10:15.402
Okay, but you are going to be
spending the night with him,

10:15.403 --> 10:17.320
and you haven't even kissed him.

10:17.355 --> 10:19.060
Yeah, that's weird.

10:19.384 --> 10:21.358
Faith, you seem uncomfortable.

10:21.392 --> 10:23.411
No, no, no. I'm fine.

10:23.677 --> 10:25.462
Yeah?

10:25.496 --> 10:27.698
Well, it doesn't have anything
to do with your friend Amy?

10:27.732 --> 10:29.299
What do you mean?

10:29.333 --> 10:32.301
I saw you two talking on the
front lawn, and it looked...

10:32.335 --> 10:34.370
You know, it looked kind of intense.

10:34.782 --> 10:36.870
She just thinks that sex

10:36.871 --> 10:38.741
shouldn't even be talked
about on TV, let alone...

10:38.776 --> 10:40.677
Really? Where does she
think it should be discussed?

10:41.490 --> 10:43.980
It's a subject for two married people

10:44.526 --> 10:47.049
under the watchful eye of God only.

10:47.083 --> 10:49.751
That doesn't leave a lot of
room for finding yourself,

10:49.786 --> 10:51.337
you know, exploring all
the different options,

10:51.338 --> 10:53.830
which is a very, very normal part

10:53.831 --> 10:55.489
of growing up, don't you think, Faith?

10:55.490 --> 10:57.566
No, I don't think that.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.561
I actually don't even know what
you're talking about, Rachel.

10:59.595 --> 11:02.662
To me, it just seems like Amy's
opinion really matters to you.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.732
Like, she's a very important
person in your life,

11:04.766 --> 11:05.933
possibly the most important.

11:05.967 --> 11:08.235
Rachel, you need to stop, seriously,

11:08.269 --> 11:12.639
'cause, um, I'm in love with Adam,

11:12.674 --> 11:16.376
and I want him to take my virginity...

11:16.411 --> 11:18.378
tonight.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.747
So... your grandgrandfather
build this farm.

11:25.897 --> 11:28.265
The whole town pitched it.

11:28.299 --> 11:30.299
I know.

11:31.835 --> 11:34.403
And... screw it.

11:45.549 --> 11:46.915
Sorry.

11:46.950 --> 11:49.317
No, please. That was - that was lovely.

11:49.351 --> 11:51.019
Yeah. Okay.

11:51.054 --> 11:54.248
All right, Adam, the thing is...

11:56.022 --> 11:57.596
I'm a virgin.

11:58.862 --> 12:02.646
And I'd like you to be my first.

12:04.199 --> 12:08.569
Wow, Faith. That is
- that's such an honor.

12:10.135 --> 12:11.633
I-It is, right?

12:11.634 --> 12:13.874
- Yes, of course.
- Yeah. Um...

12:15.987 --> 12:20.067
Can you excuse me for just a second?

12:20.068 --> 12:21.372
Sure, yeah.

12:23.699 --> 12:25.310
Rachel, are you kidding me?

12:25.311 --> 12:27.362
- Her first?
- Take it as a compliment.

12:27.363 --> 12:29.856
Okay, nothing but satisfied
customers in your wake.

12:31.468 --> 12:33.316
What the hell are we doing here?

12:33.317 --> 12:35.185
You want lessons in intellectual property,

12:35.186 --> 12:37.130
or are we having a little lawyer playdate?

12:37.164 --> 12:39.622
Ooh, sounds fun, but no. We've
thrown out the I.P. case.

12:39.623 --> 12:41.500
I'll let my client do the honors.

12:41.534 --> 12:46.251
I am suing for palimony,
promissory estoppel, and fraud.

12:46.252 --> 12:47.439
What?

12:47.473 --> 12:49.665
So, now you're alleging

12:49.666 --> 12:52.159
that your client is my client's mistress?

12:52.160 --> 12:54.950
Ooh, more like an eight-year-long
monogamous affair

12:54.951 --> 12:57.271
with promises made that remain unfulfilled.

12:57.272 --> 12:59.332
My client has turned down job offers

12:59.333 --> 13:01.672
and marriage proposals
based on said promises

13:01.673 --> 13:03.621
and is simply claiming recompense

13:03.656 --> 13:06.589
in the form of a 40%
stake in "Everlasting."

13:06.590 --> 13:09.497
This should be fun.

13:09.498 --> 13:10.795
Shouldn't it?

13:10.829 --> 13:13.563
We have cellphone records
and credit-card bills,

13:13.597 --> 13:16.533
not to mention photographs.

13:19.305 --> 13:22.190
That really didn't go well.
Was I supposed to like it?

13:22.191 --> 13:23.202
Yeah, Faith.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.908
Kissing is supposed to feel really good.

13:24.942 --> 13:26.696
Wait, wait.

13:26.697 --> 13:29.359
Have you never kissed anybody for real?

13:30.895 --> 13:32.581
Yeah, I mean...

13:33.488 --> 13:34.600
I mean...

13:34.601 --> 13:38.353
I don't know. Amy and I sort of practiced
on our pillows at camp but...

13:38.388 --> 13:39.755
And each other?

13:39.790 --> 13:41.186
What?

13:42.559 --> 13:43.719
No.

13:44.227 --> 13:45.460
No.

13:49.165 --> 13:51.800
All right, well, Faith, um...

13:51.834 --> 13:53.802
I don't know. Have you...

13:53.836 --> 13:56.204
Have you ever thought that you and Amy,

13:56.550 --> 13:58.610
you know, that you might
be in love with Amy?

14:00.156 --> 14:01.743
That's disgusting.

14:01.777 --> 14:03.243
No, it's not.

14:03.277 --> 14:04.657
It's beautiful.

14:04.658 --> 14:07.480
Wow. Looks like you enjoy spas.

14:07.515 --> 14:09.416
As does he.

14:09.450 --> 14:12.186
We just went to Canyon Ranch
six weeks ago for four nights.

14:12.220 --> 14:15.589
And all these credit-card
charges are in your name.

14:15.623 --> 14:20.193
Yes, but the hotel folio shows
two guests and a male facial.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.261
That could be any man.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.796
But it wasn't.

14:23.831 --> 14:26.398
And I'm sure that Mr. Wilton's
credit-card statements,

14:26.399 --> 14:29.380
once subpoenaed, will reflect
charges in Tucson, Arizona,

14:29.381 --> 14:30.648
that week, as well.

14:31.462 --> 14:33.626
No, he actually pays cash.

14:33.627 --> 14:35.085
What?

14:36.438 --> 14:39.444
Based on all of this... evidence,

14:39.478 --> 14:41.813
the only thing that I can gather

14:42.284 --> 14:44.307
is you've been stalking my client.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.442
Come on. Stalking?

14:47.443 --> 14:49.081
We have grounds for a restraining order,

14:49.082 --> 14:53.420
which, if Chet gives the word,
I'm prepared to file today.

15:00.891 --> 15:03.399
We've had unholy thoughts...

15:04.273 --> 15:06.259
but we've never acted on them.

15:06.703 --> 15:08.305
Faith, why did you come on TV

15:08.339 --> 15:10.556
if you were so confused about this stuff?

15:10.557 --> 15:11.947
I don't know.

15:11.948 --> 15:14.543
I thought I would go off to Hollywood,

15:14.578 --> 15:18.114
and there would be this prince,

15:18.149 --> 15:19.883
and he'd be rich.

15:21.370 --> 15:24.720
And then everything...
Everything would be fixed.

15:24.755 --> 15:26.756
Yeah, listen, you don't need any fixing.

15:26.791 --> 15:28.922
There is just a whole world of people

15:28.923 --> 15:30.292
that are just waiting to love you

15:30.326 --> 15:32.220
and Amy for who you both are.

15:32.857 --> 15:37.245
God's gonna strike me
down for loving a woman.

15:38.507 --> 15:40.969
My family is gonna disown me,

15:41.004 --> 15:43.505
and my church would kick me out.

15:43.539 --> 15:45.307
They'd have to.

15:47.224 --> 15:49.021
Okay, well, I have an idea, Faith.

15:49.022 --> 15:50.371
I have an idea.

15:50.372 --> 15:51.551
What if you just...

15:51.552 --> 15:53.915
What if you just said it out loud one time?

15:53.949 --> 15:56.784
You know, see if God strikes you down.

16:05.159 --> 16:07.179
I can't do that, Rachel.

16:07.180 --> 16:08.528
- Come on.
- I can't do it.

16:08.562 --> 16:11.568
How does it feel having all of
this bottled up all the time?

16:11.930 --> 16:13.846
Just say it out loud.

16:14.196 --> 16:15.717
One time.

16:18.474 --> 16:20.297
Hey, Faith, you all right?

16:20.907 --> 16:23.108
Yeah.

16:23.341 --> 16:24.874
Yeah.

16:25.460 --> 16:29.246
Sorry about all that
kissy-kissy stuff earlier.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.548
That's perfectly all right.

16:31.582 --> 16:32.882
Don't worry. Yeah.

16:32.917 --> 16:34.951
Adam, I got to tell you something.

16:34.985 --> 16:36.419
Sure.

16:37.282 --> 16:39.342
Actually, um...

16:40.004 --> 16:44.993
I'm not... attracted to you.

16:45.479 --> 16:49.612
Um, are you attracted to someone else?

16:53.175 --> 16:54.635
Yes.

16:55.446 --> 16:58.906
To one person, actually.

17:02.485 --> 17:04.445
To my friend.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.470
Amy.

17:33.340 --> 17:35.571
My gosh.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.851
Hey, you.

17:47.140 --> 17:50.361
Hey Quinn.
Can I talk about the video invites?

17:50.362 --> 17:53.162
- Where is Rachel?
- Mississippi, remember?

17:53.197 --> 17:55.265
Quinn, what's wrong?

17:55.299 --> 17:58.334
Chet's screwing me.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.937
Sorry, Quinn, but I kind of
feel like everybody knows that.

18:00.971 --> 18:02.506
No. No, no, no, no.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.913
I mean...

18:05.264 --> 18:09.678
he's trying to say that I stalked him.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.146
Why the hell would he say that?

18:11.180 --> 18:14.206
- Because I'm suing him.
- What are you suing him for?

18:14.207 --> 18:18.587
Because I created this... "Everlasting."

18:18.622 --> 18:20.989
- <i>You</i> did?
- Yep.

18:21.024 --> 18:23.643
Yeah, it was my idea.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.228
It's my idea.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.361
All mine!

18:28.864 --> 18:31.433
Ha ha.

18:31.467 --> 18:33.827
They are throwing my case out.

18:33.828 --> 18:36.526
Listen, why are you
taking this so literally?

18:36.560 --> 18:38.528
You're the best producer in the industry.

18:38.562 --> 18:41.630
You could make a perfectly happy
person jump off a bridge.

18:41.664 --> 18:44.033
Thank you.

18:44.067 --> 18:47.102
So, screw the lawyers. Produce Chet.

18:47.137 --> 18:49.338
Make <i>him</i> jump off a bridge.

18:49.372 --> 18:51.017
Legally, I mean.

18:51.018 --> 18:52.508
Damn it.

18:55.263 --> 18:56.878
You are right.

19:00.115 --> 19:02.783
What, wait... What did you want?

19:02.817 --> 19:05.346
- I mean, before.
- It's... it's nothing.

19:05.347 --> 19:06.674
Look, it's Mary. I tried.

19:06.675 --> 19:08.322
- I really got in there, but I think.
- Mary.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.040
No, I'll do it. I'll go talk to her.

19:10.041 --> 19:11.292
I'll go do it. I'll go talk to her.

19:11.326 --> 19:13.127
No, no, no, Quinn. That's
not what I wanted...

19:13.162 --> 19:14.962
It's okay. We're good. Good talk.

19:14.996 --> 19:16.663
Hey. Hi. I...

19:16.697 --> 19:19.732
I need you to pull out
that coming-out bit and...

19:19.767 --> 19:21.468
- Rach, Rach, I can't.
- Why?

19:21.502 --> 19:23.970
The new post supervisor is crazy OCD.

19:24.004 --> 19:25.405
Yeah, but I promised Faith

19:25.440 --> 19:26.612
that we wouldn't air it
unless she was ready.

19:26.613 --> 19:28.708
Rach, you got to ask me before
you do stuff like that.

19:28.742 --> 19:30.277
All right, I could have
dropped a new card in.

19:30.311 --> 19:32.011
You could have shot whatever
the hell you wanted.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.446
Okay, okay.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.747
What are we gonna do? What can we do?

19:35.782 --> 19:38.150
There's nothing to do, Rach. You
got to call someone at home.

19:38.185 --> 19:39.685
You got to get them to intercept it

19:39.719 --> 19:41.677
and log it and then hide it.

19:41.678 --> 19:43.255
Okay. Copy that.

19:44.824 --> 19:48.594
Well, hey, y'all. How is Mississippi?

19:48.628 --> 19:50.562
Hey, do you remember coming
out to your parents?

19:50.596 --> 19:52.997
God. Why did you remind me?

19:53.031 --> 19:55.533
Yeah, I need you to do something for me.

20:04.143 --> 20:05.710
Mary.

20:05.744 --> 20:07.077
Hi.

20:07.112 --> 20:10.050
I'm Quinn. We've never officially met,

20:10.051 --> 20:13.245
but I'm the executive
producer of this show.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.485
Did I do something wrong?

20:14.519 --> 20:16.453
I just have a question for you.

20:16.488 --> 20:17.687
Okay.

20:17.722 --> 20:19.389
Why are you here?

20:19.856 --> 20:20.916
What?

20:20.917 --> 20:23.759
I mean, why did you decide to do this show?

20:24.406 --> 20:27.430
Um... to start over,

20:27.464 --> 20:32.535
to, um, put myself out there
and broaden my horizons.

20:32.569 --> 20:34.637
And you feel like you're doing that?

20:34.671 --> 20:36.616
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,

20:36.617 --> 20:38.207
this is definitely out of my comfort zone.

20:38.242 --> 20:40.575
It shows.

20:40.610 --> 20:42.710
Come on. Sit down with me.

20:44.280 --> 20:48.472
It just makes me so sad,

20:48.473 --> 20:53.780
because I can see that something or someone

20:54.342 --> 20:56.279
scared the crap out of you.

20:57.315 --> 21:00.661
Made you scared of your own power.

21:01.897 --> 21:04.765
Did someone scare you, Mary?

21:06.337 --> 21:08.946
Um, maybe.

21:09.943 --> 21:14.374
Then nail them to the
cross and burn it down.

21:14.408 --> 21:16.976
Okay? Because let me tell you something...

21:17.010 --> 21:19.350
One grown-ass woman to another...

21:19.351 --> 21:22.081
You do not want to find yourself

21:22.115 --> 21:24.971
another eight years down the road,

21:24.972 --> 21:29.960
having never been honest
about what you really want.

21:36.449 --> 21:38.963
So

21:38.998 --> 21:42.401
Either ball-up and give a shit,

21:42.435 --> 21:44.844
or pack your bags right now.

21:46.610 --> 21:47.876
Take care.

21:57.249 --> 21:59.584
I mean, honestly, you guys,

21:59.618 --> 22:02.242
screw my friends at Vassar working at PBS.

22:02.243 --> 22:06.189
Faith's coming out could be
seen by 15 million people.

22:06.224 --> 22:07.624
That changes lives.

22:07.658 --> 22:09.445
I mean, that's the reason

22:09.446 --> 22:11.394
why I wanted to get into
TV in the first place.

22:11.429 --> 22:13.263
I mean, it's a huge, huge platform.

22:13.297 --> 22:15.484
I suppose I wouldn't mind if
this crazy chapter in my life

22:15.485 --> 22:17.100
- did something good for the human race.
- I mean, right?

22:17.134 --> 22:18.835
- Right?
- You guys.

22:18.869 --> 22:20.737
- Yeah? Hi!
- Okay.

22:20.771 --> 22:23.372
I've been praying on it.

22:23.406 --> 22:25.274
I don't want to fight it anymore.

22:25.308 --> 22:26.442
I'm in love with Amy.

22:26.476 --> 22:28.198
I want to quit the show.

22:30.415 --> 22:32.047
Wow, Faith.

22:32.048 --> 22:34.495
That will... well, have
you talked to Amy yet?

22:34.496 --> 22:37.435
Yeah. She's praying on it, too.

22:37.436 --> 22:40.321
There's a... There's a lot to pray on.

22:40.356 --> 22:43.358
God's grace is in me,
Rachel. I can feel it.

22:43.392 --> 22:45.025
- Yeah.
- My gosh.

22:45.060 --> 22:48.748
It's just giving me God bumps all over me!

22:48.749 --> 22:50.046
Look at my arm!

22:50.047 --> 22:52.511
I want to do it again tomorrow.

22:52.512 --> 22:54.889
A-at the church dance. I want to testify.

22:54.890 --> 22:56.670
Okay, Faith, no, listen,
that's a huge step.

22:56.704 --> 22:58.387
My congregation needs to know

22:58.388 --> 23:00.559
that God cherishes all his children.

23:00.560 --> 23:01.708
Yes, of course, of course.

23:01.743 --> 23:03.532
But have you talked to your Gran yet?

23:03.533 --> 23:06.235
Rachel, look, if Gran can
see that one person...

23:06.270 --> 23:07.902
You or you guys...

23:07.903 --> 23:09.700
Can accept me,

23:09.701 --> 23:11.669
if she can see that I can have friends

23:11.670 --> 23:14.198
and I can have love, it's
gonna soften the blow.

23:14.199 --> 23:15.310
Don't you think?

23:16.236 --> 23:17.703
All right, all right. Let's just...

23:17.737 --> 23:19.854
Let's just kick this hillbilly town's ass

23:19.855 --> 23:21.340
into the new millennium! Should we do it?

23:21.375 --> 23:23.142
Yeah! This is what I'm talking about!

23:23.177 --> 23:24.967
I mean, I'll see if I can find

23:24.968 --> 23:27.258
some extra, you know, bonus
money for you and Amy

23:27.259 --> 23:29.833
so you guys can move someplace
a little bit more accepting.

23:29.834 --> 23:31.510
What? No, I'm not moving.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.502
This is my home. This is where I live.

23:33.503 --> 23:36.321
I'm gonna stay here and
make them all believe.

23:49.665 --> 23:53.267
I just want to see her
married before I die.

23:53.301 --> 23:57.204
D-don't you think that
Adam is a nice young boy?

23:57.238 --> 23:59.406
Yeah. Absolutely. He's a great guy.

23:59.441 --> 24:01.708
"Real mensch," as my mother would say.

24:01.742 --> 24:05.312
Hey, Gran? Would you
excuse us for just a minute?

24:05.347 --> 24:06.713
- Yes.
- Yeah.

24:06.747 --> 24:08.823
I'll be right back.

24:08.824 --> 24:11.400
Thanks. One sec. What's up, sweetie?

24:14.054 --> 24:15.849
I don't know what you did
to get Faith's head all screwed up,

24:15.850 --> 24:17.162
but she is not in her right mind.

24:17.163 --> 24:20.223
- Listen, Amy, did she tell you...
- Yeah. She told me.

24:20.224 --> 24:21.896
She might be ready, but I'm not.

24:21.897 --> 24:23.606
- I'm a Sunday School teacher.
- I know. I know.

24:23.607 --> 24:24.697
But Amy, I promise you...

24:24.731 --> 24:26.466
I promise you the world has really changed.

24:26.500 --> 24:27.899
Yeah, in Hollywood.

24:27.933 --> 24:29.767
You know what they do to...

24:29.802 --> 24:31.303
gay people around here?

24:31.337 --> 24:34.106
Does Matthew Shepard ring a bell?

24:35.475 --> 24:38.043
My goodness.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.412
Thank you so much for coming.

24:40.446 --> 24:42.780
Thank you for being here.

24:43.782 --> 24:46.717
It's been so great to see all y'all,

24:46.751 --> 24:50.557
rememberin' all the love and support

24:50.558 --> 24:52.289
that you've given me all my life.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.957
We love you, Faith!

24:53.992 --> 24:55.959
I love you, too!

24:58.696 --> 25:01.431
there is...

25:01.465 --> 25:04.534
There's something I-I got to tell y'all,

25:04.568 --> 25:09.305
that might change that.

25:09.340 --> 25:11.774
It shouldn't.

25:11.808 --> 25:14.110
Hell, nothing should, right?

25:14.145 --> 25:15.845
Right!

25:21.584 --> 25:27.285
And... okay, t-the thing is...

25:28.909 --> 25:32.718
this is just about who has my heart.

25:32.719 --> 25:34.505
Truth is...

25:35.138 --> 25:37.398
- there's someone here that I love...
- Just go up there.

25:39.435 --> 25:41.635
More than anyone in the world.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.204
God.

25:43.238 --> 25:44.638
And...

25:44.673 --> 25:47.056
I am so sorry for interrupting, Faith,

25:47.057 --> 25:48.591
but I think I know where
you're going with this.

25:48.592 --> 25:50.781
Um, so, I have a question for you.

25:54.198 --> 25:55.722
Faith...

25:59.886 --> 26:02.822
Faith, will you continue this journey
with me for another week?

26:07.193 --> 26:09.128
Yes, I will.

26:12.265 --> 26:14.533
Thank you.

26:14.568 --> 26:16.386
You're welcome.

26:25.612 --> 26:27.044
<i>It's Jay. Leave a message.</i>

26:27.079 --> 26:29.603
Jay, I need you to kill the footage.

26:29.604 --> 26:30.902
I mean, bury it, burn it,

26:30.903 --> 26:32.783
physically destroy it, and I'm not kidding.

26:32.818 --> 26:34.586
Okay? I'll take the heat.

26:36.646 --> 26:39.290
What are we gonna tell Quinn?
We don't have a story.

26:39.325 --> 26:41.159
I'll figure it out.

26:42.194 --> 26:44.786
<i>Standby for Mary's video invite.
Take one.</i>

26:44.787 --> 26:47.060
Are these gonna be big enough for you?

26:48.577 --> 26:50.734
Throw away the cue cards.

26:51.524 --> 26:52.863
I've got a new script.

26:52.864 --> 26:55.024
- Great. Cheers.
- No. No, thank you.

26:55.058 --> 26:57.526
<i>All right, people. Mary's
video invite, take one.</i>

26:57.560 --> 26:59.094
<i>Here we go.</i>

26:59.129 --> 27:00.995
Okay, so, what do you need to sell this?

27:01.030 --> 27:02.730
I'm thinking, like, a
silhouette in the window

27:02.764 --> 27:05.967
of the two of you taking your clothes off,

27:06.001 --> 27:08.036
and then just, you know,
making some noises.

27:08.070 --> 27:10.542
Like  you know.

27:10.543 --> 27:12.343
- Yeah, okay.
- That's it.

27:12.344 --> 27:14.142
- Okay.
- That's all I'm thinking.

27:14.176 --> 27:15.643
Okay.

27:17.546 --> 27:18.712
Hey. Hey.

27:18.746 --> 27:20.513
Are you okay with this?

27:20.548 --> 27:22.149
Yeah, yeah. I guess.

27:22.183 --> 27:25.819
It's... you know, finish the
show, give Gran a thrill.

27:25.854 --> 27:27.054
Okay.

27:27.088 --> 27:30.490
I mean, you're asking about all of it?

27:32.493 --> 27:35.027
I'm good with you.

27:35.062 --> 27:37.830
You just got to give me some time, okay?

27:37.865 --> 27:39.332
Okay.

27:58.616 --> 28:00.451
Ready?

28:00.486 --> 28:03.021
My gosh.

28:03.770 --> 28:07.259
Hey. Hi.

28:07.293 --> 28:09.526
There you go.

28:12.697 --> 28:15.099
No, thanks.

28:15.133 --> 28:16.934
What?

28:16.968 --> 28:20.337
Not drinking, and you did a
totally selfless act today?

28:20.372 --> 28:23.274
It's all right. I won't
tell Quinn, I promise.

28:26.258 --> 28:28.081
Covering it up feels weird.

28:28.082 --> 28:31.180
Not as weird as outing someone
who's not ready yet, Rach.

28:31.215 --> 28:33.049
No, if you think that I wanted
this just for the show, I...

28:33.083 --> 28:34.483
I don't... no, no, no. Hey, no, no, no.

28:34.518 --> 28:36.085
I think you did something good for Faith,

28:36.120 --> 28:38.288
and she's gonna thank you for it one day.
I promise.

28:38.322 --> 28:41.557
That's great.

28:43.435 --> 28:45.731
- Rach, I got to ask you.
- Yeah.

28:45.732 --> 28:48.177
What happened while you were gone?

28:48.302 --> 28:49.965
Where'd you disappear to?

28:49.999 --> 28:52.687
I don't... I-I-I don't
want some Rachel story.

28:52.688 --> 28:54.403
I want the truth.

28:57.773 --> 28:59.387
Um, well, I was in jail.

28:59.388 --> 29:01.605
The whole time? Come on, Rach.

29:03.124 --> 29:04.760
I was, um...

29:06.512 --> 29:09.396
in my sweatpants, under the covers,

29:09.397 --> 29:12.181
watching bad TV and eating ice cream.

29:12.182 --> 29:15.689
Which... wait a second...
I had it delivered.

29:17.058 --> 29:18.624
Okay, I didn't... I didn't leave the house.

29:18.659 --> 29:20.680
- Not at all?
- No. No, no, no.

29:20.681 --> 29:22.228
Mnh-mnh.

29:22.263 --> 29:23.613
Depressed?

29:25.837 --> 29:28.097
Yeah, I could barely move.

29:29.070 --> 29:30.909
Why didn't you call me, Rach?

29:31.196 --> 29:33.743
Because depressed people don't call.

29:34.467 --> 29:37.264
Not depressed people
when they're depressed.

29:38.378 --> 29:40.764
What all of this because of Mexico?

29:42.148 --> 29:43.915
I was that bad?

29:43.950 --> 29:45.084
No.

29:45.118 --> 29:48.119
Come on. God, no. I just... God.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.456
I don't really do well,
you know, with happiness.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.458
It's... It's very unfamiliar.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.843
It's...

29:57.429 --> 30:00.064
it's terrifying, actually.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.949
Why'd you come back?

30:04.669 --> 30:06.209
Honestly?

30:09.807 --> 30:12.109
I wanted to see you.

30:53.082 --> 30:55.417
I can't.

30:55.451 --> 30:58.819
Why? Why? Why?

30:58.854 --> 31:01.855
'Cause I know how things start with you.

31:01.889 --> 31:04.958
And I know how they end.

31:04.992 --> 31:06.733
I can't do it, Rach.

31:12.230 --> 31:13.579
What the hell am I doing here?

31:13.580 --> 31:15.728
My client has one last piece of evidence

31:15.762 --> 31:17.062
she'd like to present.

31:17.097 --> 31:18.105
I have advised her not to,

31:18.106 --> 31:20.866
but she is... incredibly stubborn.

31:36.548 --> 31:39.651
This is evidence?

31:44.388 --> 31:47.638
- Leave.
- Chet, you sure?

31:47.639 --> 31:51.041
You pay me $700 an hour to make sure
you don't think with your dick.

31:51.042 --> 31:53.875
Get out. You too.

32:04.418 --> 32:06.075
You kept that?

32:08.619 --> 32:11.647
Yes, you asshole.

32:12.251 --> 32:13.492
Why?

32:14.678 --> 32:17.552
'Cause it's the only time
you ever said "I love you."

32:24.121 --> 32:26.368
I'm sorry about that, kiddo.

32:27.923 --> 32:29.263
I really am.

32:38.799 --> 32:41.368
I'm agreeing to her original terms.

32:41.402 --> 32:44.533
40% ownership of
"Everlasting" in perpetuity.

32:47.074 --> 32:48.939
The show was your idea.

33:01.255 --> 33:04.690
I'll give you a minute.

33:12.231 --> 33:16.000
Adam, you have one video invitation left.

33:16.034 --> 33:18.223
Are you ready?

33:21.874 --> 33:25.776
<i>Well, Adam... um, up until this morning,</i>

33:25.810 --> 33:27.811
<i>I thought I'd be going home this week.</i>

33:27.845 --> 33:30.080
<i>I want to explain why I haven't been</i>

33:30.114 --> 33:32.249
<i>completely honest about myself.</i>

33:32.284 --> 33:34.518
<i>How can you pick me if
you don't know who I am?</i>

33:34.552 --> 33:41.658
<i>So, um, I was in an abusive marriage.</i>

33:41.692 --> 33:43.993
<i>I know I don't look the part.</i>

33:44.027 --> 33:47.196
<i>Neither did he, but...</i>

33:47.230 --> 33:51.801
<i>behind closed doors, it was...
it was brutal.</i>

33:51.835 --> 33:56.406
<i>When he broke my daughter,
Lily Belle's, arm,</i>

33:56.440 --> 34:01.476
<i>of course he threatened
to kill me if I told.</i>

34:01.511 --> 34:04.346
<i>And he meant it.</i>

34:04.380 --> 34:06.448
<i>But I told.</i>

34:06.482 --> 34:08.516
<i>I told the police.</i>

34:08.551 --> 34:11.052
<i>I told my family.</i>

34:11.085 --> 34:16.290
<i>I would do anything to protect my baby.</i>

34:16.324 --> 34:19.193
<i>I guess I-I just want you to know</i>

34:19.226 --> 34:21.128
<i>that's the kind of woman I am.</i>

34:21.161 --> 34:25.800
<i>So, send me home so I can be
with my sweet girl</i>

34:25.833 --> 34:31.138
<i>or pick me  so you can meet her.</i>

34:31.172 --> 34:34.273
<i>I trust that you'll do that.</i>

34:40.214 --> 34:43.983
Mary, your story moved and impressed me.

34:45.119 --> 34:47.219
I'd love to meet your daughter.

34:53.393 --> 34:55.159
Rach?

34:55.194 --> 34:58.597
You know how Chet gets
really pushy sometimes?

35:00.066 --> 35:05.036
He said we didn't have any
drama in this ep, and...

35:05.071 --> 35:06.271
What?

35:06.305 --> 35:09.440
He read the damn logs from the Faith trip.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.175
What was I supposed to do?

35:14.913 --> 35:17.047
<i>This is just about who has my heart.</i>

35:17.082 --> 35:18.481
That's it right there.

35:18.482 --> 35:20.050
- See?
- Chet, hey.

35:20.085 --> 35:21.719
Hey, weirdo. Hi.

35:21.754 --> 35:23.320
And what's the prince doing here?
We just wanted to...

35:23.355 --> 35:25.088
We just... we wanted to talk
to you about the footage.

35:25.122 --> 35:27.190
I know. All that hillbilly lesbo stuff

35:27.224 --> 35:28.425
is great, isn't it?

35:28.459 --> 35:29.760
And thanks to Jay for spotting that.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.661
Chet... I-I-I mean, that's not...

35:31.696 --> 35:33.864
I'm sorry. Excuse me, did... Jay
Jay brought it to you?

35:33.898 --> 35:36.266
Yeah, yeah. I told him we needed
a water-cooler moment next week

35:36.300 --> 35:38.635
for renewal, and, this is so weird.

35:38.669 --> 35:40.036
It's good, and it's weird.

35:40.070 --> 35:41.771
Hey, go back... Cut back to that shot

35:41.805 --> 35:43.406
of her with the crucifix.

35:45.609 --> 35:46.776
Yeah.

35:46.810 --> 35:48.944
And... go.

35:48.978 --> 35:51.724
Next week on "Everlasting,"

35:51.725 --> 35:53.822
one of the ladies will put her whole...

35:53.823 --> 35:55.183
Yeah, Chet, I know that the
footage is really good.

35:55.985 --> 35:57.252
What happened?

35:57.287 --> 35:58.520
I thought she was gonna come out

35:58.554 --> 35:59.821
at the... At the church dance.

35:59.855 --> 36:01.255
That would have been so boo-yah!

36:01.290 --> 36:03.106
Gay is so... actually,
it's like two years ago,

36:03.107 --> 36:04.225
and transgender is now.

36:04.259 --> 36:06.497
- God, he's a populist genius, isn't he?
- You know what?

36:06.498 --> 36:09.764
We actually stopped the story because
there was a much better story here,

36:09.799 --> 36:11.132
- a much bigger story.
- Yeah? What?

36:11.133 --> 36:12.801
She lost it to Adam.

36:12.835 --> 36:15.469
- Yeah.
- Come on.

36:15.503 --> 36:17.438
She's a lesbo, lezzie,
lezzie, lesbo, Les. Come on.

36:17.472 --> 36:19.272
- Chet, you just can't...
- All those fake sex noises.

36:19.307 --> 36:20.908
Sorry, guv'ner, she doesn't
fancy your bangers and mash.

36:20.942 --> 36:22.543
Okay, it became abundantly
clear while we were shooting

36:22.577 --> 36:23.577
that outing her would ruin her life, so...

36:23.611 --> 36:24.845
Well, she signed up for it.

36:24.879 --> 36:27.113
You know, they all sign up for it, so...

36:27.148 --> 36:29.182
You can't use this footage.

36:29.216 --> 36:31.884
I'm sorry, <i>what</i> did you just say?

36:31.919 --> 36:34.219
You can't use the footage.

36:34.254 --> 36:36.188
Okay, I made a verbal agreement with her.

36:36.222 --> 36:37.323
You can't use it.

36:37.357 --> 36:38.958
Well, that's a little like the maid

36:38.992 --> 36:41.226
saying that she owns the silver
because she polished it.

36:41.261 --> 36:43.329
You don't have the right to
make an agreement like that.

36:43.363 --> 36:44.430
You know why?

36:44.465 --> 36:46.332
Because I own every inch of footage

36:46.366 --> 36:48.367
and every single camera on this show.

36:48.401 --> 36:50.034
You're day labor. You got it?

36:50.069 --> 36:52.504
Well, I'm just gonna chain myself
to the bulldozer, then, okay?

36:52.538 --> 36:55.139
I own the bulldozer. I own the chains.

36:55.174 --> 36:57.776
So why don't you grow up?

36:57.810 --> 36:59.878
Hey, Chet, can I steal
you for a quick minute?

36:59.912 --> 37:01.980
Honestly, I'm... look, I'm
with you on this one.

37:02.014 --> 37:05.016
But, um, I do... look, I've got
something that you might...

37:05.050 --> 37:06.951
You might enjoy even more.

37:13.291 --> 37:16.066
L-look, I'm sorry, okay,

37:16.067 --> 37:17.728
but she's got to come out sometime.

37:17.762 --> 37:20.030
So, what, it's up to you to decide when?

37:20.064 --> 37:22.466
You know, Perez stopped
doing that recently.

37:22.500 --> 37:24.634
Rach, our show's like a mirror, okay?

37:24.668 --> 37:26.402
It helps people face the truth.

37:26.436 --> 37:29.238
- Did you just quote Dr. Wagerstein to me?
- My God.

37:29.272 --> 37:30.974
How did it feel when that...

37:31.008 --> 37:32.942
That ball of crap fell out of your mouth?

37:32.977 --> 37:34.744
I mean, it feel good?

37:34.778 --> 37:37.046
Chet said he would hook me up

37:37.080 --> 37:38.748
if I found something big.

37:38.782 --> 37:40.682
And so, what, you fell for it?

37:40.717 --> 37:43.418
I've got to find my way
out of here somehow.

37:43.452 --> 37:45.954
I just want to remind you
that there used to be

37:45.989 --> 37:48.757
at least, like, a few things
that you wouldn't do.

37:48.791 --> 37:49.925
Yeah, you too.

37:49.959 --> 37:51.927
Yeah, but we're not talking about me.

37:51.961 --> 37:54.563
We're talking about
people we can still save.

38:05.231 --> 38:08.433
Hey, Goldberg, where the hell you been?

38:08.468 --> 38:09.968
Come on. Let's go. Get in here.

38:10.002 --> 38:11.856
"Hollywood Tonight's"
airing next week's promo.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.055
I'm good. I don't want in.

38:13.056 --> 38:15.907
Come on. I think you're
gonna want to see this one.

38:15.941 --> 38:17.609
Come on.

38:17.643 --> 38:20.844
<i>"Hollywood
Tonight's" exclusive scoop</i>

38:20.878 --> 38:23.481
<i>on the "Everlasting" suitor's sex tape.</i>

38:23.515 --> 38:26.650
<i>This newly leaked tape shows Adam Cromwell</i>

38:26.684 --> 38:29.720
<i>shagging the sister of a royal someone.</i>

38:29.754 --> 38:32.022
<i>I want to get ahead of it.</i>

38:32.056 --> 38:34.791
<i>And I want to reassure the
women I'm currently courting</i>

38:34.826 --> 38:37.627
<i>I am serious about putting
my past behind me</i>

38:37.661 --> 38:39.295
<i>and about finding true love.</i>

38:39.330 --> 38:41.564
I wonder why Adam gave
this straight to Chet.

38:48.739 --> 38:50.806
Hey. Staying strong?

38:50.841 --> 38:52.642
Heard you did well on the road.

38:52.676 --> 38:53.842
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

38:53.876 --> 38:55.644
<i>So</i> good.

38:57.079 --> 38:59.314
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:59.349 --> 39:02.351
So, they said everything
is on this, but...

39:02.385 --> 39:04.853
I will double check, yeah. Thank you.

39:04.887 --> 39:07.122
Really. It's very sweet.

39:07.157 --> 39:09.991
No, don't... Don't mention it.
Faith's great for ratings,

39:10.026 --> 39:13.761
and  fly-over states
are gonna love me  so...

39:13.795 --> 39:17.498
Pippa? I have to. I have to ask. Pippa?

39:17.533 --> 39:21.469
Yeah, well, um, it's...
It's a lot of my face

39:21.503 --> 39:23.271
and a lot of very blurry bits

39:23.305 --> 39:25.273
that might not actually be Pippa.

39:25.307 --> 39:28.545
But tell the story once
and, they latch on.

39:28.546 --> 39:30.877
Look at you, Cromwell,
getting the hang of it.

39:30.911 --> 39:32.279
Very impressed.

39:32.313 --> 39:34.113
Well, Faith is your baby
bird to protect now.

39:34.148 --> 39:36.749
You think? Well, I would
say that she's <i>our</i> baby bird.

39:36.784 --> 39:38.285
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:40.655 --> 39:43.022
Can I ask you a weird question?

39:43.057 --> 39:46.024
Yeah.

39:46.059 --> 39:48.960
Are we friends?

39:51.331 --> 39:53.999
Um... hadn't really thought about it.

39:54.033 --> 39:58.571
Yes? I guess we are.

39:58.605 --> 40:01.272
Look, I don't know how in the
hell this just happened,

40:01.307 --> 40:04.975
but in this exact moment...

40:05.010 --> 40:07.579
you're my only friend.

40:08.416 --> 40:09.927
Let's not break it.

40:09.928 --> 40:11.463
Breaking it's really fun.

40:11.464 --> 40:13.885
Yeah, but for, like, the
first 20 minutes, you know.

40:13.886 --> 40:16.354
Come on, listen. You - you
should get some rest.

40:16.388 --> 40:17.687
You've got kids flying in tomorrow.

40:17.688 --> 40:19.128
Sounds like so much fun.

40:37.708 --> 40:39.609
<i>I-I...</i>

40:39.643 --> 40:41.377
<i>Where are you gonna be in a year?</i>

40:41.411 --> 40:43.078
<i>I'm gonna be writing my novel.
Where are</i> you <i>gonna be?</i>

40:43.113 --> 40:44.813
I'll just be married to you.

40:44.848 --> 40:48.751
Really. You don't say.

41:25.553 --> 41:27.453
Mama's still got it.

41:27.488 --> 41:31.190
Bitches beware.
