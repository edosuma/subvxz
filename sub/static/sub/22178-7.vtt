I've only ever known
one person good enough

37:26.487 --> 37:28.309
to pass on their name...

37:31.019 --> 37:32.719
My mother.

37:32.998 --> 37:33.931
Yeah.

37:34.262 --> 37:35.278
She, uh...

37:35.303 --> 37:37.712
She tried to stay with
me as long as she could.

37:38.974 --> 37:41.482
And I vow to do the same for you...

37:43.113 --> 37:44.346
Alice.

37:46.956 --> 37:53.694
[SIRENS WAIL, RADIO CHATTER]

37:57.632 --> 37:59.061
What do you want?

37:59.086 --> 38:02.209
To say I'm sorry about the page.

38:02.234 --> 38:04.534
Weaver said it was for the best.

38:04.559 --> 38:06.982
And I can't always figure
that out for myself.

38:07.007 --> 38:08.807
Take a look at what he was covering up.

38:13.650 --> 38:15.349
Now you tell me, was that for the best?

38:18.143 --> 38:19.326
You know what?

38:19.351 --> 38:21.284
I understand.

38:24.612 --> 38:26.905
I'm just disappointed.

38:27.257 --> 38:29.223
You're not the person
I thought you were.

38:45.707 --> 38:46.873
[ENGINE STARTS]

38:46.898 --> 38:49.398
[SIREN WAILS]

39:03.199 --> 39:05.032
Oh, my God, Mother!

39:05.354 --> 39:06.901
I just heard.

39:07.612 --> 39:09.966
Officers, may I have a minute?

39:09.991 --> 39:12.158
Just to say goodbye.

39:15.154 --> 39:16.287
VICTORIA: Stop pretending.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.511
I know you're awake.

39:18.915 --> 39:21.949
You always did underestimate me.

39:22.018 --> 39:23.451
I knew Detective Rogers

39:23.520 --> 39:26.537
was obsessed with this
Eloise Gardener case,

39:26.562 --> 39:29.967
so I poisoned the only person

39:29.992 --> 39:31.792
he knew was connected to it.

39:32.221 --> 39:34.355
Rogers did the rest of the work himself.

39:34.380 --> 39:37.302
Why did you do this, Drizella?

39:37.341 --> 39:39.917
So I could finally be free of you.

39:40.590 --> 39:42.117
[EXHALES SHARPLY]

39:42.505 --> 39:44.824
And now she's free of you, too,

39:44.849 --> 39:47.208
and you're the prisoner.

39:47.233 --> 39:50.457
You stupid child.

39:53.409 --> 39:55.361
You have no idea

39:55.386 --> 39:58.332
what you just let crawl
out into this world.

39:58.636 --> 40:00.696
But you will find out.

40:00.721 --> 40:01.972
Yes, you will.

40:01.997 --> 40:03.997
You will find out.

40:15.182 --> 40:17.103
Henry? What is it? Is something wrong?

40:17.136 --> 40:19.236
Uh, Rogers called. He found her.

40:19.261 --> 40:21.328
Eloise Gardener.

40:21.353 --> 40:23.160
Your stepmother's been arrested.

40:24.665 --> 40:27.091
Wait. Belfrey's going to jail?

40:27.277 --> 40:28.777
- Lucy...
- Yeah, I have a feeling

40:28.802 --> 40:32.283
she doesn't get to keep custody
of Lucy if she's locked up.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.624
I have to go to her now.

40:34.649 --> 40:35.581
Yeah, yeah! Go.

40:35.606 --> 40:37.262
- Yeah.
- Go, go, go!

40:40.425 --> 40:41.635
Lucy!

40:42.418 --> 40:43.531
LUCY: Mom!

40:43.600 --> 40:45.166
What's going on?

40:45.234 --> 40:47.101
No one's telling me what's going on!

40:47.170 --> 40:49.842
No, it's okay, baby.
We're gonna get to go home.

40:49.867 --> 40:50.832
WOMAN: Well...

40:53.732 --> 40:54.864
What?

40:54.889 --> 40:58.679
Jacinda, meet Miss Scarlet
with social services.

40:58.748 --> 41:00.934
I have been trying to explain to her

41:00.959 --> 41:01.882
that Lucy should go with you.

41:01.951 --> 41:03.117
I mean, this is outrageous.

41:03.186 --> 41:05.353
It's just procedure.

41:05.850 --> 41:08.489
Custody was given to
Ms. Belfrey for a reason.

41:08.558 --> 41:10.703
Until we can review the case,

41:10.728 --> 41:12.294
Lucy needs to come with us.

41:12.319 --> 41:14.099
Into the system?

41:17.204 --> 41:18.336
No.

41:18.361 --> 41:19.627
Come along, Lucy.

41:19.652 --> 41:21.904
Mom! Don't let them take
me! I don't want to go!

41:21.929 --> 41:23.649
Hey. Hey, hey, no, it's okay, baby.

41:23.674 --> 41:24.913
[CRYING] Mom.

41:24.938 --> 41:27.201
- Hey, it's gonna be okay.
- Mom!

41:27.226 --> 41:28.409
[CRIES]

41:28.595 --> 41:30.027
JACINDA: I'm gonna get you back.

41:30.455 --> 41:31.788
I promise.
