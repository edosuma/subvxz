00:08.132 --> 00:10.167
Hey, Charlie!
It's your big sister Teddy

00:10.168 --> 00:13.371
with the latest installment
of my video diary.

00:13.372 --> 00:15.675
Teddy, turn that thing off.
It's breakfast time.

00:15.676 --> 00:17.546
In a minute!

00:18.616 --> 00:21.452
That noise you hear is our
neighbor's annoying new dog.

00:21.453 --> 00:23.087
Ever since she got
that little rat,

00:23.088 --> 00:25.492
- none of us have gotten any sleep.
- Teddy, I asked you

00:25.493 --> 00:27.628
- to do something.
- And I asked for a minute!

00:27.629 --> 00:29.297
Your breakfast
is getting cold.

00:29.298 --> 00:31.566
Well, then just put it
back in the toaster!

00:33.970 --> 00:36.505
Sorry you had to see that.

00:36.506 --> 00:39.609
There is no prize in here.
There's supposed to be a prize.

00:39.610 --> 00:41.344
You took it out yesterday.

00:41.345 --> 00:43.212
I know, but I
put it back in

00:43.213 --> 00:45.882
so I'd have something
to look forward to.

00:47.051 --> 00:48.686
Bob, where are you?

00:48.687 --> 00:51.221
- Can I have a minute?!
- Well, hurry up!

00:51.222 --> 00:53.723
You're missing
quality family time!

00:55.126 --> 00:56.761
Gabe, stop hitting
the toaster.

00:56.762 --> 00:58.596
But it's taking forever.

00:58.597 --> 01:01.530
I don't even remember
what I put in here.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.699
Okay, Charlie,
I will get you your juice

01:05.700 --> 01:07.300
In just a minute, honey.

01:09.137 --> 01:12.706
Whoa! Even
Charlie's in a mood.

01:12.707 --> 01:15.108
Morning.

01:15.109 --> 01:18.879
- Bob, did you forget to do
something? - I'll kiss you tonight.

01:20.115 --> 01:22.316
No. You only shaved
half your face.

01:22.317 --> 01:25.518
Pick, pick, pick.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.654
Maybe this is how
I like to wear it now.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.222
Well, it looks ridiculous.

01:29.223 --> 01:31.090
What if I decided just
to brush half my hair?

01:31.091 --> 01:33.326
I thought you already
made that decision.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.894
Oh, you are going down!

01:36.497 --> 01:38.899
Wait! Stop! Stop!
Do you guys hear that?

01:38.900 --> 01:41.568
- I don't hear anything.
- Exactly.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.203
The barking stopped.

01:48.777 --> 01:50.744
- Oh, come on!
- Really?

02:47.967 --> 02:50.468
Well, at least Charlie's
getting some sleep.

02:50.469 --> 02:53.704
Why did Mrs. Dabney have to
get that stupid dog, anyway?

02:53.705 --> 02:55.805
Why couldn't she get something
that made less noise...

02:55.806 --> 02:57.340
Like a fish?

02:57.341 --> 02:59.609
Fish don't make any noise.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.477
I wish you were a fish.

03:03.213 --> 03:04.846
Can we all agree that
thing is a pest?

03:04.847 --> 03:06.782
Because as an exterminator,
it is my job

03:06.783 --> 03:08.383
To take care of pests.

03:08.384 --> 03:10.218
When you say "take care of,"

03:10.219 --> 03:12.355
I know you actually mean kill.

03:12.356 --> 03:14.490
Which I'm totally fine with,
by the way.

03:14.491 --> 03:17.126
I'll just go over to
Mrs. Dabney's and demand

03:17.127 --> 03:18.727
She keep the dog in at night.

03:18.728 --> 03:20.928
Or we could just
try being friendly.

03:20.929 --> 03:23.798
Friendly? With Mrs. Dabney?

03:24.700 --> 03:26.768
What is this,
crazy idea day?

03:26.769 --> 03:29.336
Okay, look, I am serious.

03:29.337 --> 03:30.938
How about I invite
her over tonight

03:30.939 --> 03:32.906
for a cup of coffee
and I bake a pie?

03:32.907 --> 03:36.142
I thought you wanted
this to go well.

03:36.143 --> 03:38.210
Okay, we'll have
Mrs. Dabney over,

03:38.211 --> 03:40.079
but I want everybody
on their best behavior,

03:40.080 --> 03:41.580
especially you, mister.

03:41.581 --> 03:43.815
I don't think I have
a best behavior.

03:43.816 --> 03:45.917
Yeah, well, you'd better
find one before tonight.

03:45.918 --> 03:49.321
In her defense, Mrs. Dabney
wasn't always like this.

03:49.322 --> 03:51.657
She actually used to be
kind of nice.

03:51.658 --> 03:53.726
When was that?

03:53.727 --> 03:55.726
Let's see,
how old are you?

04:00.531 --> 04:02.432
All right, got my pie.

04:02.433 --> 04:04.967
What do you want?

04:04.968 --> 04:06.702
We don't want anything,
Mrs. Dabney.

04:06.703 --> 04:08.437
Yeah, we're just
being neighborly.

04:08.438 --> 04:10.572
What did he do?

04:10.573 --> 04:12.240
I didn't do anything.

04:12.241 --> 04:14.441
I don't like you, Gabe.

04:14.442 --> 04:17.176
But I like you,
Mrs. Dabney.

04:17.177 --> 04:20.310
In fact, I'd like
to take care of you.

04:21.813 --> 04:23.480
Out.

04:26.484 --> 04:29.185
Mrs. Dabney,
so you have a new dog...

04:29.186 --> 04:30.953
A little chihuahua.

04:30.954 --> 04:32.721
So that's what
this is about.

04:32.722 --> 04:34.656
It's not not
what this is about.

04:35.658 --> 04:37.959
Dog's got a name...
Hercules.

04:39.728 --> 04:41.261
That's funny because...

04:41.262 --> 04:44.030
Hercules is like
so big and strong

04:44.031 --> 04:47.466
And your dog is so...

04:47.467 --> 04:50.135
Just being neighborly.

04:50.136 --> 04:53.538
Look, the thing is, hercules
has a tendency to bark...

04:53.539 --> 04:55.073
A lot...

04:55.074 --> 04:57.407
All night long.

04:57.408 --> 04:59.176
Right, so we were
wondering if maybe

04:59.177 --> 05:00.878
you could bring him
in before bedtime.

05:00.879 --> 05:02.848
Oh, no!
Fresh air's good for dogs.

05:02.849 --> 05:05.050
Well, sleep
is good for people.

05:07.053 --> 05:10.154
I had that same thought

05:10.155 --> 05:13.557
After every one of your
many babies arrived.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.661
We were talking
about the dog.

05:18.662 --> 05:22.064
Well, since we're
airing our grievances...

05:22.065 --> 05:24.466
We begged her not
to make that pie.

05:24.467 --> 05:27.769
I was gonna say that maybe
there's a little something

05:27.770 --> 05:29.270
You can do for me.

05:29.271 --> 05:31.072
Oh, Mrs. Dabney,
we've already told you,

05:31.073 --> 05:33.441
We're not sending Gabe
to military school.

05:34.943 --> 05:38.244
But if it's a deal-breaker,
we are willing to send him

05:38.245 --> 05:39.912
To other places.

05:39.913 --> 05:43.382
I was talking about
your oak tree out back.

05:43.383 --> 05:46.218
There's a branch
that hangs over my yard

05:46.219 --> 05:49.520
Always dropping acorns
and making a big mess.

05:49.521 --> 05:51.288
Well, no problem.

05:51.289 --> 05:53.223
Dog goes in,
branch comes off.

05:53.224 --> 05:56.726
- We got a deal?
- We have a deal.

05:56.727 --> 05:58.962
Dad, that branch
holds our treehouse.

05:58.963 --> 06:00.964
Well, so what? You kids
haven't been up there in years.

06:00.965 --> 06:04.133
I'm confused. Is Gabe
going somewhere or not?

06:04.134 --> 06:06.933
You know, if that
treehouse comes down,

06:06.934 --> 06:10.135
That'll be even better... More
sunlight for my vegetable garden.

06:10.136 --> 06:12.303
Start eating healthier...
Might even make my goal

06:12.304 --> 06:14.071
Of living to be 100.

06:17.708 --> 06:21.044
Mrs. Dabney, don't you want
to stay and finish your pie?

06:21.045 --> 06:23.579
You have a good night, now.

06:26.884 --> 06:29.785
She's gone? But I didn't get my hug.

06:31.087 --> 06:33.221
Well, at least
we'll finally be able

06:33.222 --> 06:34.790
To get some sleep.

06:34.791 --> 06:36.224
Too bad we have to
lose our treehouse.

06:36.225 --> 06:38.026
- We have a treehouse?
- Yeah.

06:38.027 --> 06:40.461
Teddy and I used to go up there
all the time when we were little.

06:40.462 --> 06:42.629
Yeah, we had
so much fun up there.

06:42.630 --> 06:44.197
Are you kidding me?

06:44.198 --> 06:46.165
All you two ever did
up there was fight.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.966
That's not how I remember it.
We had great times.

06:47.967 --> 06:49.935
Yeah, I mean, except for,
you know, all those times

06:49.936 --> 06:51.936
That you fell
out the window.

06:51.937 --> 06:54.172
Oh, I enjoyed those too.

06:54.173 --> 06:56.373
How did I not know
we had a treehouse?

06:56.374 --> 06:58.375
Well, 'cause it's
kind of overgrown.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.343
I built it that summer
we went to Hawaii.

07:00.344 --> 07:02.444
You guys went to Hawaii?!

07:02.445 --> 07:05.480
Yeah. We used to do
all kinds of fun stuff.

07:05.481 --> 07:08.849
- When did that stop?
- Well, how old are you?

07:14.955 --> 07:16.890
Check it out, Charlie.

07:16.891 --> 07:18.525
Here's our old treehouse.

07:18.526 --> 07:21.161
Oh, look. Here's your
old tea party set

07:21.162 --> 07:23.063
And all our board games.

07:23.064 --> 07:24.797
Oh! Wait...
And look at this.

07:24.798 --> 07:26.465
These are the
chinese handcuffs

07:26.466 --> 07:28.334
That pj always
used to get stuck in.

07:28.335 --> 07:30.536
Uh... A little help?

07:35.242 --> 07:37.810
Oh! Baby booboo!

07:37.811 --> 07:40.112
Oh my goodness,
I thought I lost her.

07:40.113 --> 07:41.879
It's been so many years.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.180
And those years
have not been kind.

07:45.982 --> 07:48.982
Yeah, I remember.
I used to come up here

07:48.983 --> 07:50.582
And pretend booboo
was a real baby.

07:50.583 --> 07:52.150
I was a very
good mother, huh?

07:52.151 --> 07:55.453
Until you left your baby
in a treehouse for 10 years.

07:55.454 --> 07:57.455
Oh, whoa, look!

07:57.456 --> 07:59.457
Here's something you
carved into the wall.

07:59.458 --> 08:02.959
"P.J. hearts P.B."
Who's P.B.?

08:02.960 --> 08:04.527
Peanut butter.

08:05.762 --> 08:08.230
It was a simpler time.

08:08.231 --> 08:09.798
You know what stinks?

08:09.799 --> 08:11.833
When they premix it
with the jelly.

08:11.834 --> 08:14.235
No, it stinks that
Charlie's never gonna

08:14.236 --> 08:15.870
get to use
this treehouse.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.404
She'd probably
love it up here.

08:17.405 --> 08:19.606
<i>Hey, kids!
Come on down now!</i>

08:19.607 --> 08:21.975
P.J., we have to save
this place for Charlie.

08:21.976 --> 08:24.142
Well, I wish we could,
but Dad made a deal.

08:24.143 --> 08:26.712
Yeah well, deals are
made to be broken.

08:26.713 --> 08:28.280
Right!

08:28.281 --> 08:29.714
The golden rule!

08:29.715 --> 08:32.982
- Hey, kids!
- Hey, Dad!

08:32.984 --> 08:36.220
We changed our minds. We don't
want to lose the treehouse after all.

08:36.221 --> 08:38.388
It's too late.
I already shook hands on it.

08:38.389 --> 08:40.090
Well, can we at least
talk about this?

08:40.091 --> 08:42.025
Yeah, maybe
take a family vote?

08:42.025 --> 08:44.327
This isn't a democracy, guys.

08:44.328 --> 08:46.262
And by the way,
even if it was,

08:46.263 --> 08:47.963
The guy with the chainsaw

08:47.964 --> 08:49.898
Always wins.

08:49.899 --> 08:52.900
- Come on. Come on down.
- No!

08:54.069 --> 08:57.405
- No?
- No, we're not leaving.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.107
Yeah! We're
staying right here.

08:59.108 --> 09:00.908
We're fighting the power!

09:02.110 --> 09:04.278
Get down here now
or you're grounded!

09:04.279 --> 09:08.314
You can't ground someone who's
not actually on the ground.

09:08.315 --> 09:11.717
Yeah! Right on, P.J.
Fight the power!

09:11.718 --> 09:14.419
You know what?

09:14.420 --> 09:17.088
Good luck fighting
the power saw!

09:20.025 --> 09:23.426
You're coming down
one way or another!

09:23.427 --> 09:26.929
No, we are not, okay?
We have history on our side!

09:26.930 --> 09:29.365
We are going to
protest peacefully

09:29.366 --> 09:31.233
Like gandhi
and martin luther king.

09:31.234 --> 09:32.768
He had a dream.

09:32.769 --> 09:34.970
Yeah well, I got
a dream too, Teddy...

09:34.971 --> 09:36.704
To get some sleep!

09:36.705 --> 09:39.472
You're not scaring us.

09:39.473 --> 09:41.841
No! We laugh at you!

09:46.113 --> 09:48.080
All right, you know what?

09:48.081 --> 09:51.416
I'm done messing around.
I'm bringing out the big guns.

09:52.952 --> 09:55.753
That's right... Mom!

09:55.754 --> 09:57.821
You go get Mom.

09:57.822 --> 10:00.623
Yeah, she doesn't scare us!

10:00.624 --> 10:03.393
- This is bad, he's getting Mom.
- Lock her up.

10:13.766 --> 10:16.067
Go out there and get
your kids out of that tree.

10:16.068 --> 10:17.901
Okay, why are they
always my kids

10:17.902 --> 10:19.636
when they won't
do what you want?

10:19.637 --> 10:22.038
They're having
some kind of sit-in

10:22.039 --> 10:23.739
to try and save
the treehouse.

10:23.740 --> 10:25.841
Now, I appreciate that
they're taking a stand.

10:25.842 --> 10:28.944
I just don't like
that it's against me!

10:28.945 --> 10:31.513
- Would you calm down?
- But I'm the father!

10:31.514 --> 10:34.048
I'm in charge
around here!

10:34.049 --> 10:35.849
When you're not home.

10:37.551 --> 10:39.251
Honey, you are getting
upset over nothing.

10:39.252 --> 10:41.353
This is Teddy and P.J.
We're talking about.

10:41.354 --> 10:43.421
They can't be in the
same room for five minutes

10:43.422 --> 10:45.222
Without getting
into a fight.

10:45.223 --> 10:48.158
- They won't last an hour up there.
- All right.

10:48.159 --> 10:51.662
But when they come down, they're
getting punished for defying me!

10:51.663 --> 10:53.430
If that's okay with you.

10:58.501 --> 11:00.537
I'm tired.

11:00.538 --> 11:02.205
I'm cold.

11:02.206 --> 11:03.773
How much longer
can we keep this up?

11:03.774 --> 11:06.509
We've been up here
for 12 minutes.

11:06.510 --> 11:08.643
If I had known
we were gonna protest,

11:08.644 --> 11:10.212
I would have prepared.

11:10.213 --> 11:11.947
For one thing,
I wouldn't have had

11:11.948 --> 11:13.548
That extra-large
root beer.

11:13.549 --> 11:15.951
All right, let's just stay
focused on why we're here...

11:15.952 --> 11:18.052
- For Charlie.
- That doesn't help.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.587
Charlie gets to pee
whenever she wants

11:20.588 --> 11:22.888
- Which is why my idea...
- Okay, please don't tell me

11:22.889 --> 11:25.122
About diaper-for-teens again.

11:26.091 --> 11:27.725
- Hey, Gabe.
- Hey!

11:27.726 --> 11:32.194
Oh! This is the famous
treehouse I never knew about.

11:32.195 --> 11:35.263
- Want to join our sit-in? - It's just
like when Gandhi and Billie Jean King

11:35.264 --> 11:37.964
teamed up to stop
the civil war.

11:37.965 --> 11:42.067
Almost every word in
that sentence was wrong.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.270
What do you say, Gabe?
Are you in?

11:45.271 --> 11:47.271
- I'm in.
- Great.

11:47.272 --> 11:49.672
- Yeah! - But first, you'll need
to bring us some supplies,

11:49.673 --> 11:51.240
Just the essentials.

11:51.241 --> 11:53.275
Snacks, my video games,
my guitar...

11:53.276 --> 11:55.010
Whoa, dude,
this is a sit-in,

11:55.011 --> 11:56.811
Not a move-in.

11:56.812 --> 11:58.579
Oh! And some
peanut butter.

11:58.580 --> 12:01.916
Yeah, that's right,
the love affair continues.

12:01.917 --> 12:04.084
Well, I'll be back.

12:09.157 --> 12:11.792
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna join the sit-in.

12:11.793 --> 12:13.660
I have to do
what's right.

12:15.396 --> 12:17.396
How about I take you out
for ice cream instead?

12:19.265 --> 12:21.533
I'll be in the car.

12:25.270 --> 12:27.271
What was that
crazy card game

12:27.272 --> 12:29.907
We used to play
with all the eights?

12:29.908 --> 12:32.441
- Crazy eights.
- No.

12:34.010 --> 12:36.344
Where is Gabe
with the snacks?

12:36.345 --> 12:38.980
- Now I'm getting hungry.
- So hungry.

12:38.981 --> 12:40.714
I keep thinking
I smell steak cooking.

12:40.715 --> 12:43.116
Yeah, me too.

12:43.117 --> 12:45.118
Really?

12:51.325 --> 12:52.992
Oh, hey!

12:52.993 --> 12:56.560
Don't mind me... Just making
dinner for my family...

12:56.561 --> 13:00.029
You know, the ones
on the ground.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.964
Yeah, okay.
We know what you're doing

13:01.965 --> 13:03.565
And it's not gonna work.

13:03.566 --> 13:05.466
Well, suit yourself.

13:05.467 --> 13:07.834
But I'm making one
medium rare

13:07.835 --> 13:09.636
The way I know
someone likes.

13:09.637 --> 13:13.272
- I like medium rare. He's talking
about me. - Stay strong.

13:13.273 --> 13:14.974
Now, I'm gonna
be right back.

13:14.975 --> 13:16.842
I'm going
inside the house

13:16.843 --> 13:19.043
To check on my
chocolate soufflé.

13:25.816 --> 13:27.383
Two can play at this game!

13:27.384 --> 13:30.685
Yeah, if we had
a barbecue and some steaks.

13:31.687 --> 13:34.289
Catch of the day...
T-Bone.

13:34.290 --> 13:36.757
Yes!

13:37.825 --> 13:39.393
- Okay.
- No, no, no!

13:39.394 --> 13:41.595
You'll never get the T-Bone.
Go for the filet.

13:41.596 --> 13:43.596
I think I got it.
I got it! I got it!

13:43.597 --> 13:45.331
I have never
loved you more than...

13:45.332 --> 13:47.966
Idiot!

13:54.973 --> 13:58.608
I think somebody overcooked
their fishing pole.

14:00.411 --> 14:02.947
This looks more
medium well.

14:09.753 --> 14:11.320
I'm so hungry!

14:11.321 --> 14:14.322
And there's nothing
to eat up here.

14:14.323 --> 14:17.258
Or is there? Acorns...
Acorns are food, right?

14:17.259 --> 14:20.394
For squirrels.

14:20.395 --> 14:23.263
How do squirrels do this.

14:23.264 --> 14:25.165
Well, they're squirrels.

14:25.166 --> 14:27.500
You know what?

14:27.501 --> 14:29.434
I can't take this anymore.
I'm done.

14:29.435 --> 14:30.969
Wait, no!

14:30.970 --> 14:32.770
You're just giving up?
That is so like you!

14:32.771 --> 14:35.040
- What is so like me?
- To be a quitter.

14:35.041 --> 14:38.342
- Yeah? Well, you're bossy!
- I am not bossy!

14:38.343 --> 14:41.111
And don't you ever call me
that again. I forbid you!

14:41.112 --> 14:42.812
- Bossy!
- Quitty!

14:42.813 --> 14:45.015
- Oh, real mature!
- I am more mature than you are!

14:45.016 --> 14:46.816
Whatever!
Oh! Okay!

14:46.817 --> 14:48.450
Okay!

14:48.451 --> 14:50.085
All right,
drop the bat

14:50.086 --> 14:52.521
Or baby booboo
becomes baby barbecue.

14:52.522 --> 14:54.389
You wouldn't dare!

14:54.390 --> 14:56.190
Try me.

14:56.191 --> 14:58.025
- Give me the baby.
- Give me the bat.

14:58.026 --> 15:00.760
- The baby.
- The bat.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.738
P.J.!

15:14.739 --> 15:16.373
Pull me up!
Pull me up!

15:17.909 --> 15:20.044
Oh, wait!
Are you quitting?

15:20.045 --> 15:21.979
- What?
- You know, like,

15:21.980 --> 15:23.847
If I pull you back in, will
you keep doing the sit-in?

15:23.848 --> 15:25.882
Since my alternative
is a face-first dive

15:25.883 --> 15:27.716
into a hot barbecue... Yes!

15:29.419 --> 15:32.588
One more thing.

15:33.857 --> 15:36.358
You have to drive me
wherever I want to go

15:36.359 --> 15:38.360
- For the next month.
- Deal!

15:38.361 --> 15:40.162
Now pull me up,
my face is browning.

15:40.163 --> 15:41.863
Okay.

15:47.636 --> 15:49.370
Thank you for saving me.

15:49.371 --> 15:50.771
No problem.

15:50.772 --> 15:53.774
Although, you wouldn't
have had to save me

15:53.775 --> 15:55.609
If you didn't push me
out of a treehouse!

15:55.610 --> 15:57.144
Whoa whoa whoa!
Hey hey! Stop!

15:57.145 --> 15:59.279
Whoa! Truce! Truce!

16:01.181 --> 16:05.083
Gosh, what is wrong with us? We're
going at it like seven-year-olds.

16:05.084 --> 16:06.717
Mom was right.

16:06.718 --> 16:08.518
We did fight up here
all the time, didn't we?

16:08.519 --> 16:12.221
Yes, and nothing's changed.
We're still doing it.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.923
Is this the way it's always
gonna be between us?

16:14.924 --> 16:16.725
I hope not.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.426
I don't want to be
sitting on the porch

16:18.427 --> 16:20.294
Of our old folks' home
whacking each other

16:20.295 --> 16:22.396
With foam bats.

16:22.397 --> 16:25.799
Oh, do we have to live
in the same old folks' home?

16:25.800 --> 16:27.934
P.J., if we can't
come together

16:27.935 --> 16:29.969
And do this one thing
for Charlie,

16:29.970 --> 16:32.704
We're never gonna come
together on anything.

16:32.705 --> 16:35.574
You're right.

16:35.575 --> 16:38.377
We can do this...
For Charlie.

16:38.378 --> 16:39.945
For Charlie.

16:39.946 --> 16:42.613
So...

16:42.614 --> 16:45.182
What do you
want to do now?

16:45.183 --> 16:47.517
I don't know.

16:47.518 --> 16:49.418
I wish we could hurry up
and save this treehouse

16:49.419 --> 16:51.587
So we could get the heck
out of this treehouse.

16:54.758 --> 16:56.459
They're still
up in that tree.

16:56.460 --> 16:58.128
You said they'd
be down by now.

16:58.129 --> 17:00.663
Well, I thought
they would be.

17:00.664 --> 17:03.698
Why is there a plastic
hook in my steak?

17:03.699 --> 17:06.201
Eat around it.

17:06.202 --> 17:07.769
You know, when you
think about it,

17:07.770 --> 17:10.538
This is actually kind of nice.
I mean, Teddy and P.J.

17:10.539 --> 17:13.240
Are finally working together
on something. I'm proud of them.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.309
Whose side are you on,

17:15.310 --> 17:18.011
Ours or the rebels?

17:18.012 --> 17:20.247
The rebels?

17:20.248 --> 17:21.848
Okay, you realize

17:21.848 --> 17:24.849
We're not actually
at war, right?

17:24.851 --> 17:26.652
Of course I do.

17:26.653 --> 17:28.353
For that to happen,
someone would have to issue

17:28.354 --> 17:30.422
A formal
declaration of war...

17:30.423 --> 17:34.025
Which should almost
be done printing out.

17:34.026 --> 17:36.126
Bob, they're doing exactly
what we taught them to do.

17:36.127 --> 17:37.828
They're standing up
for what they believe in.

17:37.829 --> 17:39.730
Well, you know what?
Now we're going to teach them

17:39.731 --> 17:41.298
Don't mess with Daddy.

17:41.299 --> 17:43.667
Gabe, go get your
water balloon launcher.

17:43.668 --> 17:45.202
- Okay.
- Gabe, sit.

17:45.203 --> 17:47.038
Bob, you're taking
this too far.

17:47.039 --> 17:49.040
No I'm not. And I gave
you an order, mister.

17:49.041 --> 17:51.642
Gabe, stand down.

17:53.145 --> 17:56.881
Sorry, Dad, but I'm a little
more afraid of Mom.

17:58.985 --> 18:01.317
Fine. I'll fight
this battle myself.

18:05.819 --> 18:08.018
Hey, sweetheart, you're not
really afraid of me, are you?

18:08.019 --> 18:09.618
A little.

18:09.619 --> 18:11.353
Good.

18:17.059 --> 18:20.127
I'm giving you one
last chance to come down!

18:21.829 --> 18:25.398
Okay! All right!

18:25.399 --> 18:29.402
I don't like doing this,
but you've forced my hand!

18:35.006 --> 18:37.007
Oh, come on!
So lucky!

18:37.008 --> 18:38.874
You got so lucky!
You know what?

18:38.875 --> 18:40.942
Next one's coming right
through the window!

18:40.943 --> 18:43.177
Oh, yeah?
Take that!

18:47.048 --> 18:49.115
What are you doing?

18:49.116 --> 18:51.083
Fightin' the power!

18:51.084 --> 18:53.185
But we're the power.

18:53.186 --> 18:57.156
The kids are right. This
treehouse is worth saving.

18:57.157 --> 18:59.624
What is going on over here?

18:59.625 --> 19:02.727
You know, this really isn't
a good time, Mrs. Dabney.

19:02.728 --> 19:04.996
You'd better get a handle
on that family of yours

19:04.997 --> 19:07.531
'Cause right now, it looks
like they're kicking your butt.

19:07.532 --> 19:09.700
Would you let me deal
with this, please?

19:09.701 --> 19:12.869
You'd better, 'cause hercules
is getting kinda lonely.

19:12.870 --> 19:16.238
I'm thinking
of getting another dog.

19:16.239 --> 19:19.673
- Are you threatening me?
- This one's gonna be female...

19:19.674 --> 19:21.475
Might even have
some puppies.

19:24.379 --> 19:26.714
That's right.

19:26.715 --> 19:28.549
You go get them down.

19:28.550 --> 19:31.785
Time to put on
the big pants!

19:31.786 --> 19:33.619
- He's coming up.
- We have to stop him.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.954
- Hold your fire!
- Careful,

19:35.955 --> 19:38.623
This could be a trick.

19:38.624 --> 19:41.391
I come in peace. I've come
to join the resistance.

19:43.461 --> 19:45.094
All right! Yeah!

19:45.095 --> 19:46.795
That's right, Mrs. Dabney!

19:46.796 --> 19:48.463
I don't care
about your dog!

19:48.464 --> 19:50.766
Oh, the big pants are on

19:50.767 --> 19:52.534
And they're staying
up here with my family.

19:54.136 --> 19:56.002
We did it! Yes!

19:56.003 --> 19:58.238
You can have a
treehouse, Charlie.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.738
For a long long time.

20:04.210 --> 20:08.112
- What was that?
- Wait, have we ever all been up here

20:08.113 --> 20:10.882
At the same time?

20:20.959 --> 20:22.793
Is everyone okay?

20:22.794 --> 20:24.527
- Yeah...
- I think so.

20:24.528 --> 20:26.763
Whoa, look!

20:33.370 --> 20:36.304
Oh, hon!

20:39.307 --> 20:41.808
Was that so hard?

20:42.643 --> 20:44.810
Yeah.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.912
Well, the treehouse is down.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.948
So, you're gonna be bringing
your dog in tonight, right?

20:48.949 --> 20:51.383
Oh, hercules
doesn't belong to me.

20:51.384 --> 20:55.520
I was just dogsitting
for a couple of days.

20:55.521 --> 20:57.589
I'm a cat person...

20:57.590 --> 20:59.791
And an excellent
negotiator.

21:05.131 --> 21:08.233
Do not throw that balloon.

21:09.568 --> 21:11.269
We're gonna launch
that balloon, mister.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.372
Dad!

21:29.886 --> 21:31.486
Well, Charlie,
Dad and the boys

21:31.487 --> 21:33.121
Are building you
a new treehouse.

21:33.122 --> 21:36.023
So someday you can go up there
and play with baby booboo,

21:36.024 --> 21:38.525
You know, just as soon
as we find her head.

21:40.027 --> 21:42.261
Right now, she's
baby tennis ball. Yeah!

21:43.830 --> 21:45.463
No, not as much fun.

21:45.464 --> 21:47.665
Oh, and I want to recommend
that you make the treehouse

21:47.666 --> 21:49.166
No boys allowed...

21:49.167 --> 21:50.967
Especially if that boy
weighs as much as Dad,

21:50.968 --> 21:53.102
because if you do
let him up there,

21:53.103 --> 21:55.369
well, good luck, Charlie.

22:04.325 --> 22:05.560
What are you doing?

22:05.561 --> 22:07.800
Gabe says he's more scared
of Mom than he is of me.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.500
So I'm going to scare him.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.400
Hey, Dad!

22:19.500 --> 22:21.400
Gabe, honey, did you
finish your homework?
