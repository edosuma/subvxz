"Take warning by me"

02:31.502 --> 02:36.064
"Don't go for a soldier"

02:36.140 --> 02:38.938
"Don't join no army"

02:40.845 --> 02:45.578
"For the dove she will leave you
The raven will come"

02:47.318 --> 02:52.950
"And death will come marching
at the beat of the drum"

02:55.126 --> 02:58.721
"Come all you pretty fair maids"

02:58.796 --> 03:02.630
"Come walk in the sun"

03:02.700 --> 03:08.263
"And don't let your young man
ever carry a gun"

03:29.727 --> 03:32.161
[Distant Cannon Fire]

03:45.510 --> 03:47.375
[Gasps]

03:56.754 --> 03:58.619
Oh, my God!

04:19.677 --> 04:22.578
My daddy died that way.

04:22.647 --> 04:26.014
Crawled off in the bushes
and bled to death.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.108
Maybe you were the cause.

04:32.490 --> 04:34.651
Are you dyin', Mr. Yank?

04:34.725 --> 04:37.091
Help me.

05:10.428 --> 05:14.023
- What's your name, girl?
- Amelia.

05:14.098 --> 05:16.828
But everybody calls me Amy.

05:16.901 --> 05:22.134
I'm Corporal John McBurney,
but everybody calls me McB.

05:24.675 --> 05:28.270
- How old are you, Amy?
- Twelve.

05:28.346 --> 05:31.645
Thirteen in September.

05:31.716 --> 05:34.116
Old enough for kisses.

06:12.657 --> 06:15.148
Don't give up now, Mr. Yank.

06:15.226 --> 06:17.626
I mean, Mr. McB.

06:20.965 --> 06:23.229
Just over there.

06:30.775 --> 06:34.108
Miss Martha, that smoke's
sure getting awful close.

06:36.547 --> 06:39.380
You figure them Yanks is
gonna burn this place down?

06:39.450 --> 06:43.682
Hallie, don't talk that way. It's hard
enough to get the girls to study.

06:43.754 --> 06:47.986
Es-tu aujourd'hui a Paris?

06:48.059 --> 06:50.789
I can't emphasize enough...

06:50.861 --> 06:55.798
that French is a smilin' language.

06:55.866 --> 07:02.533
Le mari de Marie
est ici aujourd'hui a Paris.

07:02.606 --> 07:05.473
Abigail...

07:05.543 --> 07:07.773
you're not paying attention.

07:07.845 --> 07:12.612
I'm sorry, Miss Edwina,
but the war is soundin' so close.

07:12.683 --> 07:15.413
Doris says, if the Yankees win...

07:15.486 --> 07:17.818
they'll rape every one of us.

07:24.595 --> 07:27.564
[Amy] Miss Martha!

07:31.635 --> 07:34.069
Miss Martha!

07:36.273 --> 07:39.208
[Bell Ringing]

07:43.714 --> 07:46.740
[Amy] Help!

07:57.895 --> 07:59.829
Miss Martha!

08:05.803 --> 08:08.101
[Amy] Help!

08:08.172 --> 08:10.003
He's dyin'!

08:17.014 --> 08:19.005
How did he get here?

08:22.286 --> 08:25.153
By the grace of God, ma'am.

08:25.222 --> 08:28.555
The grace of God
in the form of this here child.

08:31.395 --> 08:34.261
What were you doin'
off the school grounds?

08:34.331 --> 08:38.392
Just pickin' some mushrooms.
And I didn't notice how far...

08:38.469 --> 08:41.529
You know the punishment
for leaving the grounds.

08:44.508 --> 08:47.705
Get him into the house.
Come and help me.

08:51.916 --> 08:53.850
Lift.

08:56.120 --> 09:01.558
[Amy] Miss Martha,
I couldn't leave him there to die.

09:01.625 --> 09:05.459
Well, you wouldn't have
had to worry about it.

09:05.529 --> 09:07.997
There'd have been
one less enemy soldier.

09:10.201 --> 09:12.931
[McB] Corporal John McBurney.

09:13.003 --> 09:16.131
66th New York.

09:16.207 --> 09:19.540
I surrender to
the prettiest Confederates...

09:22.112 --> 09:25.104
[Janie] A real blue belly.

09:25.182 --> 09:27.946
There's only one way
to tell if he's a Yank.

09:28.018 --> 09:30.384
- How's that?
- Take off his pants.

09:30.454 --> 09:32.922
- Yanks have tails.
- Doris, stop that nonsense!

09:32.990 --> 09:36.926
Amy, run out ahead
and open up the door.

09:36.994 --> 09:40.122
And then come back
and tie the blue rag on the gate.

09:40.197 --> 09:41.323
Go on!

09:41.398 --> 09:43.923
You hear that?

09:45.569 --> 09:48.436
The blue rag's a signal
for our local patrollers.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.565
We're gonna feel awful proud
turnin' one over to them.

09:53.444 --> 09:57.540
- Is he dead?
- Lizzie, why didn't you sound the alarm?

09:57.615 --> 10:00.607
- You must have seen them
crossin' the fields.
- I was readin'...

10:00.684 --> 10:02.675
The lookout is not a readin' room.

10:02.753 --> 10:04.721
Get back up on
that widow's walk.

10:04.788 --> 10:07.723
If you see any of our soldiers comin',
let me know at once.

10:07.791 --> 10:10.123
Let's put him down on the steps.

10:10.194 --> 10:12.594
Careful.
There.

10:12.663 --> 10:14.961
Doris, Abigail, get some sheets...

10:15.032 --> 10:17.466
and make up the divan
in the music room.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.934
I'll go put
the water on to boil.

10:20.004 --> 10:25.670
Amy, will you put the blue rag
on the gate as you were told?

10:25.743 --> 10:27.973
Couldn't we wait a bit for that?

10:28.045 --> 10:30.912
His pulse is weak
and he's lost a lot of blood.

10:30.981 --> 10:33.643
Gallons and gallons, Miss Martha.

10:33.717 --> 10:38.711
They'd take him away...
even though he's half dead.

10:38.789 --> 10:41.280
They're not likely
to be by again today...

10:41.358 --> 10:44.225
and they'd wait
until we'd dressed his wounds.

10:45.829 --> 10:48.093
Will you do as I asked?

10:54.271 --> 11:00.471
[Martha] If this war goes on much
longer, I'll forget I ever was a woman.

11:00.544 --> 11:03.980
The water's on to boil.
Y'all wastin' your time.

11:04.048 --> 11:07.882
I say we fix his leg,
turn him over to the patrol.

11:07.952 --> 11:10.887
He'll die in prison just the same.

11:11.956 --> 11:14.891
[Raven Cawing]

11:22.733 --> 11:24.724
[Hallie] Mr. Yankee...

11:24.802 --> 11:28.260
there was enough iron
in your leg to shoe a horse.

11:28.339 --> 11:32.537
I'm afraid it's some time
since the corporal had a bath.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.169
I noticed.
You ladies leave.

11:35.245 --> 11:38.408
I'll get some clean water
and wash him down.

11:38.482 --> 11:41.178
I'll fetch one of
my brother's nightshirts.

11:41.251 --> 11:43.685
Come, Edwina.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.221
I thought so.

11:47.891 --> 11:50.189
Is he going to die?

11:50.260 --> 11:53.423
Some day.
But for now, he's quite all right.

11:53.497 --> 11:56.728
I don't want anyone poking
in here or lurking in the halls.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.997
There's lots of mending to be done.

12:00.070 --> 12:02.732
Into the parlor, all of you.

12:05.909 --> 12:08.343
Pay no attention to them, Amy.

12:08.412 --> 12:10.937
Did the ant kill the caterpillar?

12:11.015 --> 12:13.813
No, they joined together
and dragged him underground.

12:13.884 --> 12:16.478
Probably to eat him.

12:16.553 --> 12:20.319
I don't see what this has to do
with that Yank you brought here.

12:20.391 --> 12:22.552
I do.

12:22.626 --> 12:26.494
The Yank's an intruder,
just like the caterpillar.

12:26.563 --> 12:28.895
And you should never
have brought him here.

12:28.966 --> 12:33.926
- I agree. He's probably a spy.
- I doubt that, Janie.

12:34.004 --> 12:37.804
Miss Edwina, aren't you
afraid of that blue belly?

12:37.875 --> 12:39.706
No.

12:39.777 --> 12:42.177
It's bad manners
to call him a blue belly.

12:42.246 --> 12:45.613
He has a name.
Corporal John McBurney.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.912
Call him by it.

12:49.486 --> 12:52.148
I call him Mr. McB.

12:52.222 --> 12:55.521
And I think he's ever so handsome.

13:01.799 --> 13:04.495
I got him cleaned
good to the waist.

13:04.568 --> 13:06.934
I'll lift him...

13:07.004 --> 13:10.098
and you put
the nightshirt on him.

13:17.915 --> 13:21.544
- All right, give me the other arm.
- Yes, Miss Martha.

13:21.618 --> 13:23.051
Help me.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.783
Hold the sleeve and hold it up.

13:26.857 --> 13:29.451
Yes, Miss Martha.

13:32.629 --> 13:35.894
Now, pull off his pants.

13:35.966 --> 13:40.164
Go ahead, Miss Martha. He's not made
no different than your brother.

13:53.784 --> 13:59.154
I have asked you
never to speak of my brother.

13:59.223 --> 14:01.919
Sorry, Miss Martha,
I didn't mean nothin'.

14:01.992 --> 14:04.153
The nightshirt recalled
Master Miles to me.

14:04.228 --> 14:08.790
Surprisin' it didn't you too. Surprisin'
you brang this Yank into your house...

14:08.866 --> 14:10.424
him bein' a man and all.

14:10.501 --> 14:14.164
- I didn't want to.
- [Clanging]

14:26.483 --> 14:29.611
Soldiers on the road.
They're our boys.

14:29.686 --> 14:32.154
- All right, Lizzie.
- Should I go back up?

14:32.222 --> 14:34.816
No, I should have had
you relieved before.

14:34.892 --> 14:39.420
- Janie, I believe it's your watch.
- May we go greet 'em?

14:39.496 --> 14:42.693
No... don't want them
to see you girls.

14:42.766 --> 14:45.360
Come along, girls.

15:38.155 --> 15:40.180
Captain.

15:40.257 --> 15:43.693
- What's the news?
- We won. Grant's retreatin'.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.193
Oh, thank God.

15:45.262 --> 15:47.492
Get back here, Yank!

15:47.564 --> 15:49.088
- No!
- Shoot him!

15:49.166 --> 15:50.963
Hold your fire!

15:52.236 --> 15:54.932
Get him and throw him in the wagon.

15:58.575 --> 16:01.135
[Captain]
He was wantin' to be shot.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.873
Prefers a quick death
to a slow death in Fayette Prison.

16:05.415 --> 16:07.849
That's where
the poor devils are headed.

16:09.386 --> 16:12.412
How many young ladies are here?

16:12.489 --> 16:15.617
We have six students
and a teacher.

16:15.692 --> 16:18.525
I sure wouldn't advertise it
if I were you.

16:18.595 --> 16:20.620
Oh, you mean on the sign?

16:20.697 --> 16:23.291
A lot of Yanks are
separated from their units.

16:23.367 --> 16:25.494
They're roamin' the woods
and they're desperate.

16:25.569 --> 16:29.528
You think Miss Martha is
gonna tell 'em about Mr. McB?

16:29.606 --> 16:32.666
'Course she'll tell 'em.
That's why she went out there.

16:32.743 --> 16:35.678
So, take care, ma'am.

16:41.752 --> 16:44.619
- Captain! Captain...
- Yes, ma'am?

16:49.226 --> 16:51.592
Our prayers go with you.

16:52.763 --> 16:55.459
Thank you, ma'am.
Forward!

16:57.868 --> 16:59.859
They're goin' on.

17:24.227 --> 17:26.991
What name do you go by?

17:27.064 --> 17:30.090
Hallie.

17:30.167 --> 17:32.829
Well, you can call me McB.

17:32.903 --> 17:35.201
Yank'll do fine.

17:35.272 --> 17:37.706
You and I oughta
be friends, Hallie.

17:37.774 --> 17:40.641
How do you figure that?

17:42.846 --> 17:48.079
Well, we're both kinda
prisoners here, aren't we?

17:48.151 --> 17:52.952
With one difference, Mr. Yank.
I can run.

17:57.260 --> 18:00.229
I love you, Mr. Crow...

18:01.998 --> 18:06.264
but until your wing's mended,
it's for your own good.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.463
[Martha]
You can lower it now.

18:08.538 --> 18:10.665
I couldn't have operated
this school without you.

18:10.741 --> 18:14.336
- I'm very grateful to you.
- I'm the one to be grateful.

18:14.411 --> 18:16.811
You've given me the only home
I have, Miss Martha.

18:16.880 --> 18:20.714
Even after the war is over, it'll still
be difficult for years to come.

18:25.155 --> 18:28.124
I'll have to devote myself
to runnin' the farm.

18:28.191 --> 18:32.059
I'd like you to concentrate
on building the school up again.

18:33.130 --> 18:36.861
You've become
very dear to me, Edwina.

18:36.933 --> 18:40.266
And I'm prepared
to make you a partner.

18:40.337 --> 18:43.773
And provide in my will that
you'll inherit full ownership.

18:47.611 --> 18:49.670
Miss Martha...

18:51.415 --> 18:55.351
that's unbelievably generous.
I don't know what to say.

18:55.419 --> 18:58.354
Well, there's not an ounce
of generosity in it.

18:58.422 --> 19:01.391
I need somebody capable
and responsible.

19:01.458 --> 19:04.052
You're my guarantee that
the school will continue...

19:04.127 --> 19:06.721
to bear my name
and maintain my standards.

19:07.864 --> 19:10.958
I don't know what to s...
That's wonderful.

19:18.375 --> 19:21.867
You know, you should
pray for the North to win.

19:21.945 --> 19:24.539
Why?

19:24.614 --> 19:27.208
You don't like being
a slave, do you?

19:27.284 --> 19:29.479
No, do you?

19:29.553 --> 19:30.986
Me?

19:31.054 --> 19:34.615
Oh, I'm nobody's slave.

19:34.691 --> 19:38.183
You mean, you just went out
and got yourself shot up...

19:38.261 --> 19:41.389
'cause you like
being shot up?

19:41.465 --> 19:43.956
Sometimes a man's
gotta do things...

19:44.034 --> 19:46.559
he doesn't particularly like.

19:46.636 --> 19:49.434
Not if he's free, he don't.

19:49.506 --> 19:53.636
And you white folks ain't killin' each
other because you care about us niggers.

19:53.710 --> 19:56.611
A white man's the same
everywhere in this world.

19:56.680 --> 20:01.344
You should say that men are the same
everywhere, no matter what color.

20:01.418 --> 20:03.852
Same as a beautiful...

20:05.722 --> 20:07.986
What's goin' on?

20:08.058 --> 20:11.721
Sounds like maybe
they're makin' you a coffin.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.835
How come you're not
turnin' our Yankee in?

20:18.902 --> 20:22.394
In his condition,
he'd die in that Fayette Prison.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.565
This'll hold him till he's better.

20:24.641 --> 20:27.371
I could probably kick
those shutters open with my bad leg.

20:27.444 --> 20:30.345
Perhaps, Corporal,
but not without bein' heard.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.654
Girls!

20:38.722 --> 20:40.690
[Amy] Good night.

20:40.757 --> 20:43.248
Back to your beds, instantly.

21:23.199 --> 21:26.691
At least it gives her an opportunity...

21:26.770 --> 21:29.705
to learn what
a man's body feels like.

21:31.174 --> 21:33.199
Go back to your room.

21:33.276 --> 21:38.339
- How is he?
- He has a fever.

21:40.450 --> 21:42.748
You must be tired.

21:42.819 --> 21:45.117
Wouldn't you like a chance
to go to your closet?

21:45.188 --> 21:48.851
I might sponge parts
of him you wouldn't.

21:48.925 --> 21:50.950
Oh!

21:51.027 --> 21:54.121
I knew what you were
the minute you came to this school.

21:54.197 --> 21:56.563
A hussy is a hussy.

21:56.633 --> 21:58.863
You come in here again...

21:58.935 --> 22:01.802
and you'll find your face
in a bucket of water!

22:07.777 --> 22:10.268
Do I smell eggs for breakfast?

22:10.347 --> 22:13.942
Yes, Miss Edwina.
Hallie says Mr. McB brought us luck.

22:14.017 --> 22:17.680
Those hens finally
laid some eggs.

22:20.657 --> 22:23.057
You look very pretty, Edwina.

22:23.126 --> 22:26.061
The corporal seems to be
having an effect on all of us.

22:26.129 --> 22:28.563
How is the corporal
this morning?

22:28.632 --> 22:30.566
Hungry.

22:30.634 --> 22:33.102
How long is he gonna stay
in the music room?

22:33.169 --> 22:36.696
Till he is well enough
to turn over to the patrollers.

22:36.773 --> 22:41.369
I wanna practice my harp, but I can't
with an enemy in the same room.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.571
So that's the answer.

22:43.647 --> 22:46.582
I always wondered what it would take
to make you practice.

23:11.374 --> 23:13.467
Hello.

23:21.785 --> 23:24.015
What's your name?

23:24.087 --> 23:26.214
Edwina.

23:30.694 --> 23:34.687
- Mine is...
- Corporal John McBurney.

23:34.764 --> 23:37.198
Now, how'd you know that?

23:37.267 --> 23:39.326
You said so when you came here.

23:39.402 --> 23:41.131
Did I?

23:41.204 --> 23:44.970
Oh, I must've forgotten
all about that.

23:45.041 --> 23:47.805
You know, Edwina...

23:47.877 --> 23:50.937
I got the strangest feeling
that I'm a prisoner...

23:51.014 --> 23:53.505
in some sort of girls' school.

23:53.583 --> 23:56.074
It is a girls' school.

23:58.621 --> 24:02.557
Well, you are an enemy soldier.

24:02.625 --> 24:05.617
Are you the head of the school?

24:06.629 --> 24:09.120
Lady in the portrait there.

24:09.199 --> 24:12.191
Miss Martha Farnsworth.

24:13.503 --> 24:17.837
- Who's the man with her?
- Her brother, Miles.

24:21.945 --> 24:24.140
Where's he?

24:24.214 --> 24:26.273
He disappeared.

24:26.349 --> 24:29.216
He's presumed dead.

24:29.285 --> 24:31.651
There's no man
around here at all?

24:35.325 --> 24:36.883
Well...

24:36.960 --> 24:39.656
I sure thank providence
for sending me here...

24:39.729 --> 24:43.358
rather than to one
of your prisons.

24:46.903 --> 24:50.703
I wish it were up to me
what happens to you, but it isn't.

24:52.709 --> 24:55.269
Miss Martha will decide.

25:05.455 --> 25:07.218
Bye.

25:44.627 --> 25:47.858
Well, there's the little darlin'
that saved my life.

25:47.931 --> 25:50.263
Come on in. Sit down.

25:50.333 --> 25:53.268
I can't.

25:53.336 --> 25:56.499
Your room is out-of-bounds.

26:01.511 --> 26:05.572
Oh, I told Randolph
all about you.

26:18.394 --> 26:20.328
The patrol.

26:20.396 --> 26:23.524
But even if I sounded the alarm,
Miss Martha wouldn't stop them.

26:26.102 --> 26:27.592
It's treason!

26:27.670 --> 26:32.471
Not tyin' on the blue rag
to signal the patrol is treason.

26:34.544 --> 26:36.478
Damn!

26:42.919 --> 26:44.477
Damn! Damn!

26:44.554 --> 26:47.284
[Harpsichord]

26:47.357 --> 26:49.587
That was very nice.

26:51.861 --> 26:55.957
You said there were no men
around here. Who's Randolph?

26:56.032 --> 26:59.934
Oh, I forgot about Randolph.
I'm sure you'll meet him.

27:00.003 --> 27:01.595
Who is he?

27:02.739 --> 27:05.105
Randolph is a turtle.

27:07.143 --> 27:09.441
He's a pet of Amy's.

27:09.512 --> 27:11.377
Oh.

27:17.487 --> 27:20.422
Don't go.
You may leave now...

27:20.490 --> 27:24.893
and your soldiers might come
or something. I may never see you again.

27:26.396 --> 27:28.956
I don't even know
your last name.

27:29.032 --> 27:30.932
Dabney.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.401
- Why are you afraid of me, Edwina?
- I'm not.

27:34.470 --> 27:37.701
Not really.

27:37.774 --> 27:40.743
I mean, it has nothing
to do with you.

27:42.378 --> 27:45.347
[McB] It's just that
I'm a Yankee now.

27:45.415 --> 27:50.614
- I don't suppose Yankees are
any different than other men.
- Oh, I see.

27:50.687 --> 27:53.178
So you're just afraid
of men in general?

27:59.262 --> 28:01.730
Not afraid, I just don't...

28:01.798 --> 28:04.232
trust them.

28:05.201 --> 28:07.931
Any of them.

28:08.004 --> 28:12.100
It sounds like some man
didn't treat you too kindly.

28:12.175 --> 28:15.338
Only I would've bet that
you'd never been in love.

28:15.411 --> 28:19.370
Too bad you couldn't have bet.
You'd have won.

28:21.017 --> 28:23.611
Then how'd you get
your unfair opinion of men?

28:23.686 --> 28:25.881
I'd rather not
talk about it.

28:25.955 --> 28:30.221
We won't, then.
How long have you been at this school?

28:30.293 --> 28:33.262
Since I was fifteen.
Seven years.

28:33.329 --> 28:37.163
Except for Sunday church,
I've rarely been away...

28:37.233 --> 28:41.067
- from the school grounds
for all those years.
- I wonder...

28:41.137 --> 28:45.233
if sometimes you don't think of yourself
as a sleeping beauty in a castle...

28:45.308 --> 28:47.970
waiting for a prince
to free you...

28:48.044 --> 28:50.035
with a kiss.

29:07.697 --> 29:11.656
- I wish we didn't have
to send him to prison.
- We've no choice.

29:11.734 --> 29:14.862
Harboring the enemy is a crime.
A very serious crime.

29:21.978 --> 29:25.414
- You must be Miss Farnsworth.
- I am.

29:25.481 --> 29:28.177
I was beginning to think
you were avoiding me.

29:28.251 --> 29:31.152
I wanted to thank you
for all you've done, ma'am.

29:31.220 --> 29:35.156
I don't want your thanks.
I just want you well enough
to turn over to the authorities.

29:35.224 --> 29:39.820
- You certainly don't
mince words. I like that.
- Do you indeed?

29:39.896 --> 29:43.491
Think it makes any difference to me
whether you like it or not?

29:43.566 --> 29:47.935
No, I guess it doesn't,
but I still can't help being grateful.

29:48.004 --> 29:49.335
Don't be.

29:49.405 --> 29:51.896
It's simply a matter of ethics.

29:51.974 --> 29:54.204
Something you probably
wouldn't understand.

29:54.277 --> 29:56.472
Well, you might
be surprised, ma'am.

29:56.546 --> 30:00.380
It was ethics that got me wounded
in the first place.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.748
How so?

30:05.488 --> 30:08.321
Well, you see, ma'am,
I'm a Quaker.

30:08.391 --> 30:09.790
And I don't...

30:09.859 --> 30:12.692
carry weapons into battle,
I carry bandages.

30:12.762 --> 30:16.721
And my company,
we were fighting in this thicket...

30:16.799 --> 30:19.563
and there was
this wounded rebel officer...

30:19.635 --> 30:21.865
who was trying to crawl away
from the fire.

30:21.938 --> 30:23.929
My duty was to stay with my men...

30:24.006 --> 30:26.304
but my ethics wouldn't let me.

30:28.878 --> 30:31.506
I carried that reb to safety.
That's why I got shot.

30:33.583 --> 30:36.677
Now, my conscience
does bother me...

30:36.752 --> 30:39.346
because I should've stayed
with my own troops.

30:42.358 --> 30:46.294
I feel like I deserted them,
you might say.

30:49.899 --> 30:52.732
Do your hands
hurt you terribly?

30:55.304 --> 30:59.070
Well, there's nothing more painful
than burns, ma'am.

30:59.142 --> 31:02.407
A few bottles left in
my father's wine cellar.

31:02.478 --> 31:05.743
If the pain gets too great,
I'll ask Hallie to bring you some.

31:05.815 --> 31:09.182
Does seem like a good occasion,
and I would love some wine.

31:09.252 --> 31:13.848
It was offered for your pain,
not for your pleasure!

31:13.923 --> 31:17.381
It's just that sometimes
the two do go together.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.985
Corporal McBurney...

31:20.062 --> 31:23.657
you are not our guest,
but a somewhat unwelcome visitor.

31:23.733 --> 31:26.600
We don't propose
to entertain you.

31:26.669 --> 31:30.264
I don't expect it. It's just that
I've been at war a long time.

31:30.339 --> 31:32.773
It's been months
since I've seen a woman's face.

31:32.842 --> 31:35.003
You'll find I'm easily amused.

31:35.077 --> 31:39.013
If you get any ideas of tryin' to amuse
yourself with any of the ladies...

31:39.081 --> 31:41.174
Wait just a minute...

31:41.250 --> 31:44.549
You'll find yourself out on that road
so fast you won't know what happened.

31:44.620 --> 31:46.713
I'm not that kind of man.
You know that.

31:47.890 --> 31:50.654
I know nothing of the kind.

31:50.726 --> 31:53.752
How long does it
take you, ma'am...

31:53.829 --> 31:55.660
to get to know someone?

31:55.731 --> 31:57.699
To get to know me?

31:59.302 --> 32:03.170
You'll never find out.
You won't be here that long.

32:21.657 --> 32:26.685
We'll continue our study of the Gospel
according to Saint Luke, chapter 11.

32:26.762 --> 32:28.730
"And it ca..."

32:28.798 --> 32:33.132
- [Whispering]
- Can't you wait
until after Bible reading?

32:33.202 --> 32:35.261
I really can't, Miss Martha.

32:35.338 --> 32:37.704
All right, hurry back.

32:37.773 --> 32:40.503
Chapter 11.

32:40.576 --> 32:45.513
"And it came to pass, that as he
was praying in a certain place...

32:45.581 --> 32:50.518
"when he ceased,
one of his disciples said unto him...

32:50.586 --> 32:54.522
Lord, teach us to pray as John
also taught his disciples."

33:25.521 --> 33:28.718
Well, well.

33:28.791 --> 33:35.196
I just thought I'd introduce
myself proper. I'm Carol.

33:35.264 --> 33:39.462
Carol, that's about
the nicest introduction I've ever had.

33:39.535 --> 33:44.837
And to the prettiest girl.
How old are you?

33:44.907 --> 33:49.867
Seventeen, but I know a lot more
than girls my age.

33:49.945 --> 33:53.381
Oh, I'll bet you do.

33:53.449 --> 33:57.351
Gotta get back to...

33:57.420 --> 33:59.718
Bible readin'.

34:01.991 --> 34:04.050
Say a prayer for me, will you?

34:04.126 --> 34:08.790
I would, but I've no idea
what you want.

34:18.239 --> 34:21.437
The butter churned out
to a good five pounds.

34:21.510 --> 34:24.809
That ought to trade for a sack of flour.
And we need flour bad.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.940
Sweetener, too, Miss Martha.

34:28.016 --> 34:30.850
If he doesn't have sugar,
take molasses or honey.

34:30.920 --> 34:34.617
You talk as though I didn't know how
to barter with Phil MacPherson.

34:34.690 --> 34:37.556
If he has 'em, I'll get 'em.

34:37.626 --> 34:40.686
Hallie, you might shave
Corporal McBurney.

34:40.763 --> 34:43.288
I'm tired of lookin'
at that stubble.

34:43.366 --> 34:45.697
Bye, Miss Martha.

34:47.902 --> 34:50.838
Good-bye, Miss Martha.

34:59.749 --> 35:01.740
Mr. McB?

35:05.154 --> 35:07.247
Mr. McB?

35:23.472 --> 35:26.635
- Good mornin'.
- Good morning, little friend.

35:26.709 --> 35:29.007
Feelin' better, Mr. McB?

35:29.078 --> 35:32.241
Well, I'm a little bit bed weary,
that's all.

35:32.314 --> 35:35.249
There's a pair of crutches
in the barn.

35:35.317 --> 35:38.252
Been there a long time.
Should I get 'em for you?

35:38.320 --> 35:41.255
Again, I'd be indebted to you, Amy.

35:46.328 --> 35:49.456
Can you see him?

35:49.532 --> 35:52.524
So that's Randolph, huh?

35:52.601 --> 35:56.059
Yes. And I love him very much.

35:56.138 --> 35:58.163
Not as much as you do me, I hope.

35:58.240 --> 36:02.006
As much, but different.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.477
Catch some flies
for him to eat...

36:04.547 --> 36:08.074
- while I'm gone.
- Bye.

36:10.119 --> 36:16.115
If livin' was a thing
that money could buy

36:16.192 --> 36:21.755
Don't you know the rich
would live, Lord, before we die

36:21.831 --> 36:25.665
All my troubles

36:25.734 --> 36:28.703
Is that all you're gonna give?

36:31.140 --> 36:35.133
Guess you're dryin' up
like the rest of us women around here.

36:37.012 --> 36:40.345
What you after
in this barn, Miss Amy?

36:40.416 --> 36:42.646
Those crutches.

36:42.718 --> 36:44.845
For Mr. McB.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.979
You get permission
from Miss Martha?

36:47.056 --> 36:49.854
Well, I think we should
refuse to work the garden...

36:49.925 --> 36:53.326
till Miss Martha stops givin' food
to the enemy of the Confederacy.

36:53.395 --> 36:56.387
The Bible says,
"Love thy enemy."

36:56.465 --> 36:58.729
Can't let a man like that
starve to death.

36:58.801 --> 37:00.860
Ain't enough of them now.

37:00.936 --> 37:02.198
Miss Doris...

37:02.271 --> 37:05.832
that thing in your hand
is for hoein', not leanin'.

37:05.908 --> 37:09.674
It's nigger work!
And it's ruinin' my hands.

37:09.745 --> 37:12.407
Why, I'll never be able
to play the harp again.

37:12.481 --> 37:14.676
That nigger work is what feed us.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.718
And if we don't get enough of it...

37:16.785 --> 37:19.720
you're goin' where you can play
your harp your whole livelong day.

37:19.788 --> 37:21.949
[Laughter]

37:28.664 --> 37:31.098
[Humming]

37:35.738 --> 37:39.606
Like to suck a raw egg while
I shave you? Lt'll give you energy.

37:39.675 --> 37:42.838
Sure. Thanks.

37:46.215 --> 37:51.517
You get the thanks. Those hens hadn't
laid for months 'fore you came.

37:51.587 --> 37:54.647
You must got rooster blood in you.

37:54.723 --> 37:58.819
Judging by my boots and uniform,
I don't have any blood in me.

38:00.563 --> 38:02.929
Miss Martha said
I should shave you.

38:02.998 --> 38:05.262
But I ain't so sure.

38:05.334 --> 38:11.136
I don't think the Lord wanted a man's
face all smooth like a baby's bottom.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.731
That's why he gave him whiskers.

38:13.809 --> 38:17.438
- Might be a sin to shave
that growth off.
- Then don't do it.

38:17.513 --> 38:20.209
Sinning oughta be saved
for much more important things.

38:20.282 --> 38:25.242
I better shave you.
Miss Martha give me my orders.

38:25.321 --> 38:27.482
Not the Lord.

38:31.727 --> 38:34.491
And even without whiskers...

38:34.563 --> 38:38.522
you wouldn't look
half bad for a white man.

38:38.601 --> 38:41.627
I like hearin'
you laugh, Hallie.

38:41.704 --> 38:44.195
My Ben used to say that.

38:44.273 --> 38:46.264
Who's Ben, your husband?

38:46.342 --> 38:50.472
No, we weren't rightly married,
but we sure loved each other.

38:50.546 --> 38:54.346
- Did he die?
- Don't know.
He run off a long time back.

38:54.416 --> 38:56.976
Miss Martha's brother...

38:57.052 --> 39:00.613
he decided to sell Ben off.

39:00.689 --> 39:03.715
So, Ben run away.

39:03.792 --> 39:07.091
So, he finally got us
separated all the same.

39:08.497 --> 39:12.058
Listen, Hallie, you help
me get away from here...

39:12.134 --> 39:14.796
and I'll try to find out
what happened to your Ben.

39:14.870 --> 39:17.236
Even if I have to go
to General Grant personally.

39:17.306 --> 39:19.274
You trust me now, Hal.

39:26.181 --> 39:29.673
I'll think on it, Mr. Yank.

40:04.720 --> 40:08.087
Oh, let me help you.
You all right?

40:09.558 --> 40:12.220
Oh, yeah. I just overdid
it a little, that's all.

40:12.294 --> 40:15.491
Well, sit down.

40:16.498 --> 40:19.661
- There.
- Thank you.

40:23.639 --> 40:26.369
- All right?
- Won't you sit down for a minute?

40:26.442 --> 40:29.172
No, I can't.
I have a class in a minute.

40:29.244 --> 40:32.577
Just for that minute,
then, please. Come on.

40:33.682 --> 40:35.616
Well...

40:49.298 --> 40:52.028
I woke up this morning wondering
if you could possibly be...

40:52.101 --> 40:54.228
as lovely and sweet
as you were last night.

40:54.303 --> 40:58.740
But now I see you're even prettier
than I remembered.

41:01.777 --> 41:05.713
Edwina, one way or the other
I'm gonna have to leave here...

41:05.781 --> 41:07.772
pretty soon.

41:09.852 --> 41:14.016
There isn't time enough to get to know
each other in the normal way.

41:15.524 --> 41:20.791
So I've got to ask you something
I wouldn't ordinarily ask you.

41:22.865 --> 41:27.131
See, I've never felt this way
about anybody before.

41:27.202 --> 41:31.730
I mean, you're somebody
I've always wanted to meet.

41:33.308 --> 41:36.800
And if I'm gonna be in prison...

41:36.879 --> 41:40.906
or somewhere else,
I don't want to just keep...

41:40.983 --> 41:45.920
thinking and hoping,
if nothing's gonna happen.

41:50.592 --> 41:53.720
I mean, if I'm just another
Billy Yank enemy...

41:53.796 --> 41:58.495
You're not.
I like you very much.

42:14.583 --> 42:17.381
[Lizzie] Miss Martha's back!

42:51.386 --> 42:56.255
- How did you get
those crutches, Corporal?
- I brung them to him.

42:56.325 --> 43:00.819
You had no business doing it without
being told. Who let him out of the room?

43:00.896 --> 43:05.833
I was told to shave him and it was
too dark in that boarded-up room.

43:05.901 --> 43:08.927
Well, at least it's some improvement.

43:09.004 --> 43:11.598
I'm sorry I let
her shave me, ma'am.

43:11.673 --> 43:13.937
I've always felt
the Lord didn't intend...

43:14.009 --> 43:16.739
for a man's face to be
smooth as a baby's bottom.

43:20.282 --> 43:23.410
- Go unload the buggy.
- Yes, ma'am.

43:25.020 --> 43:29.684
And thanks to you,
I've got most of my strength back.

43:31.927 --> 43:34.020
What do you think of that?

43:34.096 --> 43:36.564
That it's a foolish
waste of energy.

43:36.632 --> 43:39.567
Come help me bring
in the supplies.

43:39.635 --> 43:41.899
I'd be glad to, ma'am.

43:44.640 --> 43:47.165
There's a lot of things
I could do...

43:47.242 --> 43:49.472
to repay you for savin' me.

43:49.544 --> 43:52.911
There's just about nothin'
I don't like about farming.

43:52.981 --> 43:55.347
And I have a great respect for land.

43:55.417 --> 43:58.818
It really used to grieve me
when our outfit was movin' this way.

43:58.887 --> 44:03.085
And I could see what this war
was doin' to this fine land.

44:03.158 --> 44:06.559
Grieves me too. I used to enjoy ridin'
through our fields...

44:06.628 --> 44:09.256
seein' them rich with crops.

44:09.331 --> 44:13.631
There are things
that could use a man's help.

44:13.702 --> 44:16.933
Thank you, ma'am.
You won't regret it, I guarantee you.

44:17.005 --> 44:19.735
There are enough of us to keep
an eye on you during the day...

44:19.808 --> 44:21.332
but at night...

44:21.410 --> 44:24.345
we'll lock you up again.

44:24.413 --> 44:27.007
Well, of course.
I'd expect that.

44:27.082 --> 44:29.482
You can take the buggy now, Hallie.

44:29.551 --> 44:31.485
You'll need some clothes.

44:31.553 --> 44:33.282
Come on, Mae.

44:33.355 --> 44:35.516
Can't have you hobbling
around the girls in that.

44:35.590 --> 44:37.421
Come on, Mae.

44:37.492 --> 44:41.553
- I'll get you some things
that belonged to my brother.
- You're an angel, ma'am.

44:41.630 --> 44:44.121
An absolute angel.

44:44.199 --> 44:46.133
Thank you.

44:46.201 --> 44:48.328
You've been a great help.

44:48.403 --> 44:52.134
[Edwina] The napkin should not
be fastened at the neck.

44:52.207 --> 44:55.199
It should be laid
conveniently across the lap.

44:55.277 --> 44:59.077
And one corner should be
lifted to wipe the mouth.

44:59.147 --> 45:04.744
Men who wear a mustache
are obliged to manipulate
a napkin in a vigorous manner...

45:04.820 --> 45:06.253
Miss Edwina?

45:06.321 --> 45:09.518
...which would be
unpardonable in a lady.

45:11.326 --> 45:14.557
- Yes?
- Permission to go to my closet?

45:14.629 --> 45:18.326
- But nowhere else.
- Of course not.

45:23.305 --> 45:27.002
Now, we will all demonstrate
the proper use of a napkin.

45:47.729 --> 45:49.026
Very nice.

45:54.803 --> 45:58.796
- 'Morning.
- Well, good morning to you.

45:58.874 --> 46:01.809
Games for two are more fun.

46:03.812 --> 46:07.578
Oh, now you surprise me.

46:07.649 --> 46:10.846
Never thought you'd be afraid
to kiss a girl.

46:10.919 --> 46:16.289
Well, my mother told me
it might just stunt my growth.

46:16.358 --> 46:22.820
Well, maybe your mama was right.
You are well-developed.

46:22.898 --> 46:26.527
I'd have to say
the same about you.

46:26.601 --> 46:30.002
Well, it's not the same.

46:30.072 --> 46:36.409
I mean your shoulders and arms,
you seem to be all muscle.

46:36.478 --> 46:39.811
I bet there's not
a soft spot on you.

46:39.881 --> 46:42.543
She's not in her room.

46:42.617 --> 46:45.643
Not even in the music room
as I expected.

46:45.720 --> 46:48.917
But then,
neither is the blue belly.

46:49.758 --> 46:52.022
Doris will take charge.

46:58.934 --> 47:01.664
You're obviously very hard
to resist, Carol...

47:01.736 --> 47:04.000
but I'm not anxious to have
my head on a chopping block.

47:04.072 --> 47:09.305
What about later on tonight,
when everybody's asleep?

47:09.377 --> 47:11.641
What about it?

47:11.713 --> 47:14.773
I just happen
to have a room to myself.

47:14.850 --> 47:18.217
In the attic.
Can you walk up stairs?

47:18.286 --> 47:22.313
I suppose, but I couldn't
walk through a locked door.

47:22.390 --> 47:24.790
Oh, I forgot about that.

47:27.529 --> 47:31.090
I just thought
I'd pay our guest a little visit.

47:31.166 --> 47:34.101
He wanted to know what class
you were teachin'.

47:34.169 --> 47:36.228
And I told him etiquette.

47:36.304 --> 47:41.901
And how to behave like a lady
under all circumstances.

47:48.483 --> 47:53.853
All that anger
in those pretty green eyes?

47:53.922 --> 47:57.323
I told you before,
I don't trust any man.

48:00.362 --> 48:05.265
Did you ask her if she looks upon you
as a Billy Yank enemy?

48:05.333 --> 48:08.769
Or if she's waiting for a prince
to awaken her with a kiss?

48:08.837 --> 48:11.635
Now, come on, that's nonsense.
She doesn't mean a thing to me.

48:11.706 --> 48:14.231
Just passing time,
talking with her, that's all.

48:14.309 --> 48:17.642
Same as my father
said to my mother.

48:17.712 --> 48:19.612
"They mean nothin' to me.

48:19.681 --> 48:23.617
I was only amusin' myself."

48:23.685 --> 48:25.619
Oh, so your father
was the man?

48:27.355 --> 48:30.051
No. No, Johnny.

48:30.125 --> 48:32.218
I know how I feel.

48:32.294 --> 48:34.728
If you don't feel the same way,
just tell me.

48:34.796 --> 48:37.492
You know how I feel.

48:37.566 --> 48:41.161
When the war's over,
I'll come back and get you.

48:41.236 --> 48:44.899
- Please, Johnny, don't say
that unless you mean it.
- You know I mean it.

48:51.980 --> 48:55.245
[Edwina] Oh. Oh, no.

48:58.053 --> 49:02.319
Johnny, no. Oh.

49:06.461 --> 49:09.658
[McB's Voice] When the war's over,
I'll come back and get you.

49:09.731 --> 49:11.892
If you'll let me.

49:11.967 --> 49:15.869
- Please, Johnny, don't say
that unless you mean it.
- You know I mean it.

49:15.937 --> 49:19.168
Oh. Oh, no.

49:37.259 --> 49:41.218
Oh. Oh, I can't.

49:41.296 --> 49:46.825
Not like this.
Not without being sure.

49:46.901 --> 49:49.369
Maybe when the war's over.

49:49.437 --> 49:54.374
It's just that I never have before.
Don't be angry.

49:54.442 --> 49:57.206
If you still feel the same way...

49:57.279 --> 50:00.908
There's riders out in front.
Maybe three or four of them.

50:00.982 --> 50:03.450
It's probably just the patrollers.

50:03.518 --> 50:06.851
Or the girl on lookout,
she would've sounded the alarm.

50:15.964 --> 50:18.330
- They've stopped.
- They often do.

50:18.400 --> 50:22.598
They water their horses,
and then they ride on.

50:24.539 --> 50:27.133
I better get back
before I'm missed.

51:22.630 --> 51:24.291
Miss Martha!

51:24.366 --> 51:26.459
Miss Martha!

51:26.534 --> 51:28.559
Hold it, Yank!

51:28.636 --> 51:30.695
Hell, I ain't no Yank.

51:30.772 --> 51:33.036
Who are you?
What're you doin' here?

51:33.108 --> 51:36.635
Hurry, Miss Martha!
Hurry!

51:36.711 --> 51:38.645
I was wounded...

51:38.713 --> 51:41.307
on leave from Gregg's Texans,
Longstreet's Corps.

51:41.383 --> 51:44.375
- How come you're not in uniform?
- How come you're not?

51:44.452 --> 51:48.183
- What's going on there?
- We caught him.

51:48.256 --> 51:52.317
Why, Sam Jepson!

51:52.394 --> 51:57.093
This is my cousin
you've heard me talk about.

51:57.165 --> 52:02.432
- It's my cousin.
- Cousin Martha, I always figured
you looked down...

52:02.504 --> 52:04.199
on the Texas side of the family.

52:04.272 --> 52:07.833
It pleases me that you...
that you talk about us.

52:07.909 --> 52:10.901
Of course, I didn't say
what I said about you.

52:10.979 --> 52:13.243
Can you explain this,
Miss Farnsworth?

52:13.314 --> 52:16.545
- No, I can't explain it.
- It was tied on the gates.

52:19.287 --> 52:20.549
I've no idea.

52:20.622 --> 52:24.114
Unless it was one of
the girls as a joke.

52:24.192 --> 52:27.161
[Jepson]
These aren't times for joking.

52:27.228 --> 52:30.686
One of my men could've been killed,
or your cousin.

52:30.765 --> 52:32.392
I know, Sam.

52:32.467 --> 52:36.494
The girl who's responsible
will be severely punished.

52:36.571 --> 52:38.869
Take my word for it.

52:41.910 --> 52:44.879
Well, I do, ma'am.

52:44.946 --> 52:47.210
Thank you, Sam.

52:50.585 --> 52:52.610
I'm sorry this happened.

52:57.792 --> 53:01.250
You were splendid, ma'am,
absolutely splendid.

53:01.329 --> 53:04.355
You were quite splendid
yourself, Corporal.

53:04.432 --> 53:07.230
Your accent was pure Texas.

53:08.303 --> 53:10.931
I wonder who put
this rag on the gate.

53:11.005 --> 53:13.872
I don't know,
but you can bet I didn't.

53:13.942 --> 53:16.376
Now that you've got
your strength back...

53:16.444 --> 53:19.413
there's no reason
to serve your meals in bed.

53:19.481 --> 53:23.144
You'll have supper with us tonight.

53:23.218 --> 53:25.812
Whatever you say, ma'am.

53:27.055 --> 53:28.356
[Laughter]

53:28.356 --> 53:28.981
[Laughter]

53:29.057 --> 53:31.787
[McB] I can't remember when...

53:31.860 --> 53:34.852
I've ever been
in such delightful company.

53:34.929 --> 53:37.227
You young ladies
are a fine tribute...

53:37.298 --> 53:39.823
to the excellence
of your head mistress...

53:39.901 --> 53:42.028
to whom I will always be indebted.

53:42.103 --> 53:45.163
- You needn't be.
- But I will, ma'am.

53:45.240 --> 53:50.075
I used to make more use
of my legs than most men.

53:50.144 --> 53:52.169
Take dancing for instance.

53:52.247 --> 53:55.444
I could wear out the arm
of any fiddler.

53:55.517 --> 53:57.815
If we had dancing here
in the school...

53:57.886 --> 54:01.845
I could teach the girls
waltzes, reels, polkas.

54:03.658 --> 54:06.286
[McB] Almost anything
you could mention.

54:06.361 --> 54:10.422
- Miss Martha,
could we have a dance class?
- Yes, please?

54:10.498 --> 54:14.628
- Can we?
- I'll take it under consideration.

54:14.702 --> 54:18.832
We haven't had as lively a meal
as this in a long time.

54:18.907 --> 54:23.742
- I think it's disgraceful,
eatin' with the enemy.
- So do I, Miss Martha.

54:23.811 --> 54:27.804
You girls might have said
something before supper.

54:27.882 --> 54:31.511
- You may both be excused
to go to your room.
- Ma'am, let them stay.

54:31.586 --> 54:35.613
They're just voicing their patriotism.
Doris and Janie...

54:35.690 --> 54:40.320
I admire your father fighting
for the cause he thinks right.

54:40.395 --> 54:43.330
If nobody's gonna finish
those mushrooms, I could manage.

54:43.398 --> 54:45.366
Please do, Corporal.

54:45.433 --> 54:47.628
Amy picked them for you.

54:47.702 --> 54:49.761
Thank you, Amy.

54:49.837 --> 54:52.931
I'm particularly partial to mushrooms.

54:53.007 --> 54:54.975
Now, I'm sorry...

54:55.043 --> 54:58.274
but I must turn
to something unpleasant.

54:58.346 --> 55:01.042
Today, somebody tied the blue rag...

55:01.883 --> 55:04.249
Girls, into the kitchen.

55:04.319 --> 55:06.981
Edwina, fetch the pistol.
It's in my room.

55:07.055 --> 55:09.046
Hallie, go with them.

55:09.123 --> 55:11.114
Hide yourself upstairs, Corporal.

55:11.192 --> 55:13.217
If it's Union troops, you holler.

55:13.294 --> 55:15.125
I'll make sure
nothing happens to anyone.

55:15.196 --> 55:18.723
- They're our soldiers.
- Thank God!

55:18.800 --> 55:20.427
- Can you make it up the stairs?
- Yeah.

55:20.501 --> 55:23.902
- I'll help him.
- No, you won't! Get in the kitchen.

55:26.808 --> 55:29.743
[Pounding]

55:34.582 --> 55:36.948
[Pounding]

55:43.024 --> 55:46.858
- Let me have that pistol.
- No, I have to take it to Miss Martha.

55:46.928 --> 55:50.364
- You care about what happens
to me, don't ya?
- I don't want you shot.

55:50.431 --> 55:52.365
[Pounding]

55:54.936 --> 55:57.905
[Pounding]

56:07.115 --> 56:11.017
Come in, Captain.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

56:11.085 --> 56:15.886
That's all right, ma'am.
It's been a long time...

56:15.957 --> 56:19.154
since I've had to wait
for such a pretty lady.

56:19.227 --> 56:22.060
This vicinity's gonna be
left unprotected.

56:22.130 --> 56:24.621
Our boys gotta pull out
for Champion's Hill...

56:24.699 --> 56:27.133
before them damn Yankees,
beg your pardon...

56:27.201 --> 56:30.466
and secure the road to Vicksburg.

56:30.538 --> 56:32.529
Why have you come here?

56:32.607 --> 56:35.735
We heard about your school...

56:35.810 --> 56:39.405
and since we were scouting
in this area...

56:39.480 --> 56:42.540
we decided to stop and see
if we could be of any...

56:42.617 --> 56:44.812
assistance.

56:44.886 --> 56:48.617
Thank you, Captain,
but everything is fine here.

56:48.690 --> 56:54.219
It seems to me as how you might be
afraid of being molested by Yankees.

56:54.295 --> 56:58.231
I could leave a couple of
my boys to sleep in your barn.

56:58.299 --> 57:01.325
That's generous,
but it won't be necessary.

57:01.402 --> 57:03.495
I don't mind staying with the ladies.

57:03.571 --> 57:06.438
Y'all go on ahead.
I'll catch up.

57:06.507 --> 57:10.773
You're very kind,
but we cannot take you from your duties.

57:10.845 --> 57:14.178
It seems to me as how it might serve
some military purpose...

57:14.248 --> 57:18.582
for someone to stay behind,
and kinda out of sight.

57:18.653 --> 57:22.783
- That's right.
- I might stay myself.

57:22.857 --> 57:27.226
Now, Scoggins, suppose you ride back
and tell the colonel.

57:27.295 --> 57:29.889
No, I cannot permit it.

57:29.964 --> 57:32.797
One or two of you
would be no protection.

57:32.867 --> 57:35.267
Your presence here
might draw attention to us...

57:35.336 --> 57:38.999
and provoke the Yankees
into burning us down.

57:39.073 --> 57:41.564
Good night, gentlemen.
Thank you for your concern.

57:41.642 --> 57:43.576
I'd be right proud...

57:43.644 --> 57:47.478
to pay my compliments
to them young ladies.

57:47.548 --> 57:51.416
[Martha] That is
very gentlemanly of you, Captain.

57:51.486 --> 57:54.080
I'll tell them. Good night.

57:54.155 --> 57:57.090
Come on, boys.

57:57.158 --> 57:59.683
God bless you, gentlemen.

57:59.761 --> 58:01.991
Good night.

58:03.231 --> 58:07.395
It's all right.
They left.

58:16.177 --> 58:18.338
I love you so much.

58:18.412 --> 58:20.607
Were you scared, Miss Martha?

58:20.681 --> 58:24.117
- I almost died, I was so scared.
- So was I.

58:24.185 --> 58:26.619
Go up to your rooms.

58:26.687 --> 58:30.350
I think it's treason
to talk that way about our own boys.

58:30.424 --> 58:32.483
[Amy] Oh, Doris,
you think everything is treason.

58:32.560 --> 58:36.223
Don't argue, girls. Hallie...

58:36.297 --> 58:40.358
- bring a bottle of wine to the parlor.
- Yes, Miss Martha.

58:40.434 --> 58:42.527
Today's been quite a strain.

58:45.206 --> 58:48.437
Oh, give me the pistol.

58:51.012 --> 58:53.480
[McB] Good night, young ladies.

58:53.548 --> 58:55.982
[Girls] Good night, Mr. McB.

58:56.050 --> 58:58.109
Good night, Mr. McB.

58:58.186 --> 59:00.484
Will you come hear our prayers?

59:00.555 --> 59:03.217
- I'm too excited to sleep.
- Me too.

59:03.291 --> 59:06.283
Go on to your rooms.
I'll be there presently.

59:11.966 --> 59:14.833
Oh, I see you
can manage stairs.

59:14.902 --> 59:18.668
You know, they leave
the key in your door.

59:18.739 --> 59:21.367
I could slip down
and unlock it.

59:23.477 --> 59:26.776
You'd find me much more interesting
than Miss Edwina.

59:28.449 --> 59:30.644
You little devil.

59:30.718 --> 59:33.653
You're the one who tried
to get me caught today.

59:33.721 --> 59:36.451
Well...

59:37.658 --> 59:41.492
you shouldn't do things
that make me jealous.

59:56.744 --> 01:00:00.339
Would you care for
some wine, Corporal?

01:00:04.118 --> 01:00:07.349
- I'd be honored, ma'am.
- Do help yourself.

01:00:07.421 --> 01:00:10.117
It's on the table.

01:00:20.635 --> 01:00:24.298
I must say,
you showed great courage tonight.

01:00:24.372 --> 01:00:27.398
They were our soldiers.
There was no danger.

01:00:27.475 --> 01:00:30.842
I think I know a little more
about that than you do, ma'am.

01:00:30.912 --> 01:00:33.346
And believe me, there was danger.

01:00:33.414 --> 01:00:35.780
If you'd have shown any weakness...

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:38.648
tonight's episode could've
had a different ending.

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:42.416
I toast you.
You're a remarkable, beautiful woman.

01:00:48.596 --> 01:00:51.724
Amy, you should've finished
your prayers long ago.

01:00:51.799 --> 01:00:54.563
I was praying for Mr. McB too.

01:00:54.635 --> 01:00:58.537
[Janie] But it's wrong
to pray for the enemy.

01:00:58.606 --> 01:01:01.871
- My father says that God's on our side.
- So he is.

01:01:01.943 --> 01:01:04.468
He's on the side
of people everywhere.

01:01:04.545 --> 01:01:08.606
No more talking.
Put out your candle, Amy.

01:01:08.683 --> 01:01:11.516
- Good night, Miss Edwina.
- Good night.

01:01:11.585 --> 01:01:11.752
I've been thinking, Corporal.

01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:14.585
I've been thinking, Corporal.

01:01:14.655 --> 01:01:19.251
This place needs a man,
someone who knows farming.

01:01:19.327 --> 01:01:22.558
How to handle farm hands.

01:01:23.731 --> 01:01:26.666
Thinking about giving up
the school, ma'am?

01:01:26.734 --> 01:01:29.100
Oh, no.

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:33.163
But there won't be money for tuition,
not for a long time.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.836
But there will be money
for anything we can grow.

01:01:38.913 --> 01:01:40.938
Northern money.

01:01:41.015 --> 01:01:43.745
When my brother and I ran this place...

01:01:43.818 --> 01:01:48.187
there were good northern markets
for anything we could raise.

01:01:48.255 --> 01:01:49.984
But...

01:01:50.057 --> 01:01:53.288
he isn't here now.
Never will be.

01:01:55.196 --> 01:01:57.528
And I am?

01:01:57.598 --> 01:02:01.364
Yes, you are.

01:02:04.105 --> 01:02:08.804
Would you be interested in
staying on here, Corporal?

01:02:08.876 --> 01:02:11.868
Yes, I would.

01:02:15.316 --> 01:02:18.615
Why were we all scared
of our own soldiers?

01:02:18.686 --> 01:02:21.951
All armies have some men
who aren't nice.

01:02:22.023 --> 01:02:23.991
Now get to sleep.

01:02:25.526 --> 01:02:28.654
- Good night, Lizzie.
- Good night.

01:03:10.571 --> 01:03:14.905
I want to take your brother's place,
but I must warn you.

01:03:14.975 --> 01:03:17.569
It won't be easy
to act like a brother.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.856
I'll try not to dictate...

01:03:36.931 --> 01:03:39.866
your personal behavior, Corporal.

01:05:03.484 --> 01:05:07.420
And the joys we shared

01:05:07.488 --> 01:05:11.891
As we tarried there

01:05:11.959 --> 01:05:16.862
No lover has ever

01:05:27.808 --> 01:05:32.302
[Footsteps]

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:56.115
[Giggling]

01:09:11.098 --> 01:09:13.930
[Giggling]

01:10:37.885 --> 01:10:41.651
[Giggling]

01:11:25.899 --> 01:11:28.129
No!

01:11:29.903 --> 01:11:31.894
Edwina, listen to me!

01:11:31.972 --> 01:11:34.907
No, no, no!

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:42.842
You lying son-of-a-bitch!

01:11:42.916 --> 01:11:46.352
You bastard!
You filthy lecher!

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:49.355
I hope you're dead!

01:11:51.058 --> 01:11:54.118
Dead!

01:11:54.194 --> 01:11:56.628
I hope you're dead!

01:11:57.798 --> 01:12:02.531
Dead... dead.

01:12:05.706 --> 01:12:09.472
[Gasping]

01:12:32.399 --> 01:12:35.698
[Martha] I want all discussion
of what happened tonight...

01:12:35.769 --> 01:12:38.829
to end now.

01:12:38.905 --> 01:12:41.669
There are more urgent matters.

01:12:41.742 --> 01:12:44.677
Do you think
he's in much pain, Miss Martha?

01:12:44.745 --> 01:12:48.408
[Martha] No, not after all
the wine and laudanum we've given him.

01:12:48.482 --> 01:12:50.541
He can't feel anything.

01:12:50.617 --> 01:12:53.677
Why do you want him...

01:12:53.754 --> 01:12:57.053
in the dining room, Miss Martha?

01:12:57.124 --> 01:13:00.287
I need him there
to work on his leg.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.453
[McB Mumbling]

01:13:02.529 --> 01:13:06.158
His leg's not only fractured,
the bone is splintered.

01:13:06.233 --> 01:13:09.600
If the best doctors
couldn't set it so it healed...

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:11.103
I certainly can't.

01:13:11.171 --> 01:13:13.605
[McB] You're well-bosomed.

01:13:13.674 --> 01:13:16.643
You stop your drunken chatter.

01:13:18.178 --> 01:13:22.046
Now lift the harness
and slide him on the table.

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:27.514
Don't be jealous about it.
You're well-bosomed too.

01:13:27.587 --> 01:13:30.988
Sweet and ladylike.
So round and perky.

01:13:33.694 --> 01:13:36.060
I hate you, Miss Martha!

01:13:36.129 --> 01:13:39.690
Another teaspoon of laudanum
should put him to sleep.

01:13:39.766 --> 01:13:42.496
Give it to him.

01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:46.036
[Amy Crying]

01:13:46.106 --> 01:13:51.100
And now, Amy,
you will go to your room...

01:13:51.178 --> 01:13:53.840
and you will not come out
until you are told.

01:13:57.984 --> 01:14:02.148
And if I ever want your opinion,
I'll ask for it!

01:14:02.222 --> 01:14:04.156
I didn't say nothing.

01:14:04.224 --> 01:14:07.682
I think you did.
I think you spoke very loudly!

01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:16.460
Girls, go directly to your rooms.

01:14:16.536 --> 01:14:19.664
Edwina, Hallie, Carol...

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:22.834
stay here and don't take
your eyes off him.

01:14:22.909 --> 01:14:25.810
That shouldn't be hard
for you to do.

01:14:25.879 --> 01:14:29.178
I've reached
a very difficult decision.

01:14:29.249 --> 01:14:31.479
I hope it's the right one.

01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:35.248
By this time tomorrow,
his leg will be starting to mortify.

01:14:35.322 --> 01:14:38.314
There's no death worse
than one from gangrene...

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:40.450
and I cannot let him die...

01:14:40.527 --> 01:14:43.587
inch-by-inch in screaming agony.

01:14:43.663 --> 01:14:46.530
The only way to prevent that
is to amputate.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.296
- That mean you gonna cut off his leg?
- Yes.

01:14:49.369 --> 01:14:51.337
But you ain't a doctor.

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:54.840
If he lives and blames you for making
him a cripple, what you gonna say?

01:14:54.908 --> 01:14:57.570
He would rather lose a leg
than his life.

01:14:57.644 --> 01:14:59.976
Can you be sure
he'd die if you don't?

01:15:00.046 --> 01:15:02.571
I'm sure.

01:15:02.649 --> 01:15:06.176
What if he dies as a result
of the operation?

01:15:06.253 --> 01:15:07.845
My conscience would be clear.

01:15:07.921 --> 01:15:10.719
It wouldn't be
if I let him die...

01:15:10.791 --> 01:15:13.692
and did nothing
to try and save him.

01:15:16.863 --> 01:15:19.457
I suppose if we made the cut...

01:15:19.533 --> 01:15:23.867
above the popliteal division
instead of below...

01:15:23.937 --> 01:15:26.371
we'd have fewer arteries
to contend with.

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:29.875
There's goin' to be bleeding
no matter where you cut.

01:15:29.943 --> 01:15:33.640
We see a vessel bleeding,
we tie it with thread.

01:15:33.713 --> 01:15:37.740
If you're going to do it,
do it and be done with it!

01:15:51.264 --> 01:15:55.360
Turn his face away from me.

01:15:55.435 --> 01:16:00.031
There is some frailty in you.

01:16:03.043 --> 01:16:07.070
Dear Lord, we ask that
you bless our efforts.

01:17:42.042 --> 01:17:44.738
Mr. McB, are you coming around?

01:17:44.811 --> 01:17:48.008
Amy.

01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:51.710
I can tell it's night...

01:17:51.785 --> 01:17:55.016
when the stars come out.

01:17:55.088 --> 01:17:57.955
And I can tell it's morning...

01:17:59.025 --> 01:18:02.961
when your freckles
come in the room.

01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:07.122
I must tell Miss Martha.

01:18:12.439 --> 01:18:16.136
Miss Martha!
Miss Martha!

01:18:16.209 --> 01:18:18.905
Miss Edwina!

01:18:21.514 --> 01:18:25.075
- Come along and watch.
Hallie's going to bury it.
- Bury what?

01:18:25.151 --> 01:18:28.484
What do you think?
The leg!

01:18:32.258 --> 01:18:34.351
He's awake, Miss Martha.

01:18:57.717 --> 01:18:59.810
Ladies.

01:19:01.454 --> 01:19:05.823
I know you're expecting an apology...

01:19:05.892 --> 01:19:09.055
and you certainly deserve it...

01:19:09.129 --> 01:19:12.257
after the way
I abused your hospitality.

01:19:13.867 --> 01:19:18.361
But first could you
fix the splints...

01:19:18.438 --> 01:19:20.463
on my leg?

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:23.976
- It hurts so much.
- There are no splints.

01:19:24.044 --> 01:19:27.480
How do you fix a broken leg
without splints?

01:19:27.547 --> 01:19:29.481
The pain is...

01:19:29.549 --> 01:19:32.985
We saved your life,
and you complain of pain.

01:19:33.053 --> 01:19:37.046
But nobody dies of a broken leg.

01:19:37.123 --> 01:19:40.354
If gangrenous, they do.

01:19:40.427 --> 01:19:42.759
We had a choice:

01:19:42.829 --> 01:19:45.229
Either let you die in agony...

01:19:45.298 --> 01:19:47.357
or remove the leg.

01:19:52.238 --> 01:19:54.729
You're just trying to punish me.

01:19:54.808 --> 01:19:57.606
The Lord knows I deserve it...

01:19:57.677 --> 01:20:00.840
but I know my legs are all right.

01:20:00.914 --> 01:20:04.975
I can feel 'em
all the way down to my toes.

01:20:17.397 --> 01:20:21.390
It's a shock.
It has to be.

01:20:22.969 --> 01:20:25.563
- But you're too intelligent...
- You dirty bitch!

01:20:25.638 --> 01:20:28.004
Just because I didn't go to your bed.

01:20:28.074 --> 01:20:30.565
Just because
I went to someone else's bed.

01:20:30.643 --> 01:20:35.046
I should have
let you die screaming!

01:20:39.686 --> 01:20:43.122
Why should I have denied myself
after all I'd been through?

01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:45.487
You wanted to be
so much the goddamn lady!

01:20:45.558 --> 01:20:48.322
The virgin bitch.

01:20:48.394 --> 01:20:51.727
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

01:21:51.658 --> 01:21:54.218
[Distant Singing]

01:21:56.329 --> 01:21:58.729
What do you think it is,
Miss Martha?

01:22:01.968 --> 01:22:04.766
[Martha] It's a Union soldier camp.

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:06.930
Don't tell the other girls.

01:22:07.006 --> 01:22:10.032
No need to frighten them.
There's nothing we can do.

01:22:13.346 --> 01:22:16.611
[Amy] A cypress root is hard to cut,
but it'll last forever.

01:22:16.683 --> 01:22:19.709
That's why I picked it.

01:22:21.654 --> 01:22:23.918
I found the tree...

01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:26.720
not far from where
your soldiers are camped.

01:22:28.795 --> 01:22:31.127
Union troops?
Where?

01:22:31.197 --> 01:22:33.188
About three-miles north.

01:22:35.101 --> 01:22:38.036
I haven't heard
any sounds of any battle.

01:22:38.104 --> 01:22:40.698
Must mean the rebels have retreated.

01:22:40.773 --> 01:22:43.708
That's what Miss Martha said.

01:22:43.776 --> 01:22:46.176
- Mr. McB?
- Hmm?

01:22:50.216 --> 01:22:52.309
About Carol.

01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:54.683
Yeah, what about her?

01:22:54.754 --> 01:22:58.053
She said...

01:22:58.124 --> 01:23:01.116
you forced your way
into her room and...

01:23:01.194 --> 01:23:03.788
And that you...

01:23:03.863 --> 01:23:06.127
Do you believe her?

01:23:06.199 --> 01:23:08.759
No...

01:23:08.835 --> 01:23:13.033
but you were in her room. Why?

01:23:15.441 --> 01:23:18.001
And she was all naked.

01:23:27.553 --> 01:23:32.320
And I thought you loved me.

01:23:32.392 --> 01:23:35.293
And I do, Amy.

01:23:38.298 --> 01:23:41.734
Amy, go to your room.

01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:47.262
Removing the ligatures
will be painful.

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:50.673
- Do you want some laudanum?
- No thanks, kind lady.

01:23:50.743 --> 01:23:54.577
I'll fall asleep,
and then you might cut off...

01:23:54.647 --> 01:23:57.309
my other leg.

01:23:57.383 --> 01:23:59.647
I'd welcome some wine, though.

01:23:59.719 --> 01:24:02.210
You might welcome it,
but you won't get it.

01:24:02.288 --> 01:24:05.655
Undo your trouser leg.

01:24:05.725 --> 01:24:08.353
Where's your virgin assistant?

01:24:08.428 --> 01:24:11.454
Didn't she want to stay
to finish the job?

01:24:11.531 --> 01:24:15.558
Miss Edwina has no interest
in what happens to you.

01:24:16.903 --> 01:24:20.964
Young ladies, come get ready to eat.

01:24:38.424 --> 01:24:40.449
Johnny?

01:24:42.895 --> 01:24:44.328
Johnny?

01:24:44.397 --> 01:24:47.560
- Who is it?
- Carol.

01:24:47.633 --> 01:24:50.067
I'm sorry about what happened.

01:24:50.136 --> 01:24:54.095
- I want you to know that.
- Don't think a thing of it.

01:24:54.173 --> 01:24:57.939
I've just been thinking about...

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:01.571
all the advantages...

01:25:01.647 --> 01:25:05.105
a one-legged man has.

01:25:08.154 --> 01:25:10.452
He saves on socks.

01:25:10.523 --> 01:25:13.458
Doesn't have to worry about
trimming as many toenails.

01:25:13.526 --> 01:25:15.653
Fewer corns and bunions.

01:25:15.728 --> 01:25:17.719
I've even been contemplating...

01:25:17.797 --> 01:25:20.857
asking her to cut off
the other leg.

01:25:21.968 --> 01:25:26.098
What happened
makes no difference to me.

01:25:26.172 --> 01:25:30.506
I know it won't
hinder you romantically.

01:25:30.576 --> 01:25:33.010
I'm sure a one-legged man...

01:25:33.079 --> 01:25:36.071
or even a no-legged man...

01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:40.176
can enjoy himself that way,
same as any man.

01:25:40.253 --> 01:25:43.654
I'll do anything for you.

01:25:43.723 --> 01:25:45.987
Then unlock this door.

01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:48.288
I got some things I want to do.

01:25:48.361 --> 01:25:50.522
But somebody might see me.

01:25:50.596 --> 01:25:54.032
Do it while everyone else is eating.

01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.933
- But they'd know it was me.
- No, they won't.

01:25:57.003 --> 01:26:00.131
They'll just think
somebody forgot to lock it.

01:26:06.012 --> 01:26:08.446
All right, I'll try.

01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:25.254
How long are you
gonna keep him here?

01:27:25.324 --> 01:27:28.885
As long as Union troops
are in the area.

01:27:28.961 --> 01:27:32.397
If he's here,
he can't give information about us.

01:27:32.465 --> 01:27:34.865
But sooner or later...

01:27:34.934 --> 01:27:37.425
they'll find the school anyway,
won't they?

01:27:37.503 --> 01:27:39.937
Not if our troops drive them back.

01:27:40.006 --> 01:27:43.908
I'm praying for that,
and when it happens the corporal will...

01:27:43.976 --> 01:27:45.307
[Gunshot]

01:27:45.378 --> 01:27:48.404
Sit right where you are,
all of you!

01:27:53.953 --> 01:27:57.445
Well, hello, Miss Farnsworth.

01:27:57.523 --> 01:27:59.718
I've gotten most
of my strength back.

01:27:59.792 --> 01:28:02.989
With a little wine from your cellar,
I'll get the rest.

01:28:03.062 --> 01:28:05.587
According to the new rules
around here...

01:28:05.665 --> 01:28:07.963
I'm gonna have the run of this place.

01:28:08.034 --> 01:28:11.333
One is that I'm going
to be with any young lady...

01:28:11.404 --> 01:28:13.736
that desires my company.

01:28:13.806 --> 01:28:15.740
If you have any objections...

01:28:15.808 --> 01:28:17.833
I'm gonna locate the Union cavalry...

01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:20.344
and tell 'em about
some of the goodies...

01:28:20.413 --> 01:28:22.779
especially the bedding-down variety.

01:28:22.848 --> 01:28:26.545
Don't get any ideas
about closing the door on me.

01:28:26.619 --> 01:28:29.417
I'm liable to just
blow one of your ears off.

01:28:29.488 --> 01:28:33.788
Unless I miss and hit
one of your pretty eyes.

01:28:35.695 --> 01:28:39.563
You're wrong to blame her.
Your leg was busted bad.

01:28:39.632 --> 01:28:42.601
You don't have to be afraid
of being sent to prison now.

01:28:42.668 --> 01:28:44.659
Why don't you leave this place?

01:28:44.737 --> 01:28:47.535
Not till I've had my fill.

01:28:51.611 --> 01:28:55.604
You're a damn handsome woman.
Maybe I'll start with you.

01:28:59.885 --> 01:29:02.615
[McB]
Go on down to the cellar.

01:29:02.688 --> 01:29:05.714
I've been having
a run of bad luck lately.

01:29:05.791 --> 01:29:08.817
I understand the way to fix that
is to have a black woman.

01:29:08.894 --> 01:29:10.953
Then white boy...

01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:13.965
you better like it
with a dead black woman...

01:29:14.033 --> 01:29:17.298
'cause that's the only way
you'll get it from this one.

01:29:35.588 --> 01:29:38.056
Almighty God...

01:29:38.124 --> 01:29:40.922
I ask that this school
and its occupants...

01:29:40.993 --> 01:29:43.860
escape thy total wrath.

01:30:20.499 --> 01:30:23.696
Be quiet and sit down.

01:30:23.769 --> 01:30:27.102
Hallie, Janie's on watch.
I want her here.

01:30:27.173 --> 01:30:29.903
- Close the door behind you.
- What can we do?

01:30:29.975 --> 01:30:33.138
- I'm so scared.
- I know, dear.

01:30:33.212 --> 01:30:37.205
He told me he was gonna kill me
if I made any noise.

01:30:37.283 --> 01:30:39.945
And he forced me
to do what he wanted.

01:30:40.019 --> 01:30:42.146
We understand, Carol.

01:30:42.221 --> 01:30:46.317
He made me do
the most terrible things.

01:30:47.993 --> 01:30:50.427
Where the hell is everybody?

01:30:51.897 --> 01:30:54.525
Edwina, you go sit in my chair.

01:30:55.334 --> 01:30:57.359
Hallie, stay by me.

01:30:57.436 --> 01:30:59.836
We must give him no provocation.

01:31:07.446 --> 01:31:08.970
Well, well.

01:31:09.048 --> 01:31:12.176
All the little seminar darlings.

01:31:12.251 --> 01:31:16.585
What is the good lady
"seminaring" you in now?

01:31:16.655 --> 01:31:20.352
Mister Johnny, please.
Why don't you just leave!

01:31:20.426 --> 01:31:22.553
Yes, take your possessions with you.

01:31:22.628 --> 01:31:25.688
And my leg!
Can I take that with me?

01:31:28.134 --> 01:31:30.694
You girls know
why Miss Dabney there...

01:31:30.770 --> 01:31:33.136
knocked me down the stairs.

01:31:33.205 --> 01:31:37.369
That's because I went
to Carol's room instead of hers.

01:31:37.443 --> 01:31:41.436
And do you know how I got out
of my room in the first place?

01:31:41.514 --> 01:31:45.348
Because this fine lady,
Miss Farnsworth, unlocked my door...

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:47.647
so I could go to her room.

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.245
And do you know
why Miss Farnsworth...

01:31:50.322 --> 01:31:52.620
chopped off my leg
and left me a cripple?

01:31:52.691 --> 01:31:56.991
So I could stay on here,
and be at her beck and call.

01:31:57.062 --> 01:32:00.998
The picture in this locket.

01:32:01.066 --> 01:32:04.194
- Is that your sweetheart?
- That's my brother.

01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:07.728
- That wasn't the question.
- You stole that.

01:32:07.807 --> 01:32:10.571
Give it back to me, please.

01:32:10.643 --> 01:32:13.203
Why would I want to give it back?

01:32:13.279 --> 01:32:15.713
It belonged to my mother.

01:32:15.781 --> 01:32:20.218
I found it with a stack of letters
with a blue ribbon...

01:32:20.286 --> 01:32:23.278
- tied around it.
- You read his letters?

01:32:23.355 --> 01:32:24.822
Enough.

01:32:27.893 --> 01:32:30.088
- You beast!
- That's right!

01:32:30.162 --> 01:32:32.596
But I don't run a school
for young girls!

01:32:32.665 --> 01:32:36.157
These girls might like to know
what kind of woman runs this place!

01:32:36.235 --> 01:32:39.170
Mr. McB, Randolph hasn't eaten in days!

01:32:39.238 --> 01:32:41.172
You could get him to!

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.674
You tryin' to wheedle that woman?

01:32:43.742 --> 01:32:45.903
Randolph!

01:32:45.978 --> 01:32:50.608
God in heaven, child,
I didn't mean to do that.

01:32:50.683 --> 01:32:53.743
Stay away from me!
I hate you!

01:32:53.819 --> 01:32:56.720
Condemned me,
that's what you've done.

01:32:56.789 --> 01:33:00.350
To bitterness and drink,
and doing mean things.

01:33:00.426 --> 01:33:03.156
Why the hell didn't you
just castrate me?

01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:20.410
- Where are you going?
- To him. He needs help.

01:33:20.479 --> 01:33:22.413
Not from you!

01:33:22.481 --> 01:33:25.678
I will not let you make
a fool of yourself!

01:33:46.338 --> 01:33:48.568
What do you want?

01:34:35.054 --> 01:34:37.420
I love you.

01:34:39.725 --> 01:34:42.319
I love you!

01:34:56.675 --> 01:35:00.372
Perhaps when he's sober again,
he'll be more reasonable.

01:35:00.446 --> 01:35:03.847
Perhaps together
we can persuade him to leave.

01:35:03.916 --> 01:35:07.010
You said he might send
Yankee soldiers here.

01:35:07.086 --> 01:35:10.021
Yes, you're quite right, Janie.

01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:14.088
Yes, we can't take that risk.

01:35:14.159 --> 01:35:19.893
No one in this house is safe
as long as he remains here.

01:35:19.965 --> 01:35:23.264
The only question now is
how to rid ourselves of him.

01:35:23.335 --> 01:35:25.895
Enemy soldiers are always shot.

01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:28.838
With what?
He's got the only gun.

01:35:28.907 --> 01:35:30.898
Tie him up when he's asleep...

01:35:30.976 --> 01:35:32.910
and take him into the woods.

01:35:32.978 --> 01:35:35.811
Just leave him there
to die of thirst and hunger?

01:35:35.881 --> 01:35:38.816
I think that would be
too cruel, Miss Martha.

01:35:38.884 --> 01:35:42.547
If he were tied up,
why couldn't we hang him?

01:35:42.621 --> 01:35:47.320
Oh, any such action
would be too drastic.

01:35:47.393 --> 01:35:51.329
None of us would want
to be responsible for his death.

01:35:51.397 --> 01:35:54.628
Or even be capable of it.

01:35:58.404 --> 01:36:00.463
Maybe...

01:36:00.539 --> 01:36:05.067
if we were to prepare him
an excellent supper...

01:36:06.278 --> 01:36:11.147
and said that we wanted
to make it up to him.

01:36:11.216 --> 01:36:13.150
Hallie...

01:36:13.218 --> 01:36:16.654
you could prepare
your savory chicken.

01:36:16.722 --> 01:36:18.747
And Amy...

01:36:18.824 --> 01:36:21.122
could pick some mushrooms.

01:36:21.193 --> 01:36:23.923
They're his favorite dish...

01:36:23.996 --> 01:36:26.157
and we could prepare them...

01:36:26.231 --> 01:36:29.723
especially for him.

01:36:36.675 --> 01:36:39.644
Do you think
you could do that, Amy?

01:36:46.952 --> 01:36:49.580
I know just
where to find 'em.

01:37:03.569 --> 01:37:07.767
I was surprised at your
supper invitation, Miss Farnsworth.

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:10.775
I didn't know
whether to accept or not.

01:37:10.843 --> 01:37:13.971
I said and did
some ugly things today.

01:37:14.046 --> 01:37:16.105
I'm sober now.

01:37:16.181 --> 01:37:19.344
I've told Edwina,
and I want to tell you...

01:37:19.418 --> 01:37:23.377
and the rest of the girls
how much I apologize.

01:37:23.455 --> 01:37:25.616
We accept your apology, Corporal.

01:37:25.691 --> 01:37:28.956
But I think now it's best
if we don't speak about it.

01:37:29.027 --> 01:37:32.428
Now, would you care to say grace...

01:37:32.498 --> 01:37:34.523
Corporal?

01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:40.636
Good bread, good meat...

01:37:40.706 --> 01:37:43.470
good God, let's eat.

01:37:53.352 --> 01:37:57.083
God, we thank you for what
we're about to receive...

01:37:57.156 --> 01:38:01.820
and we hope that the drums
that divide us will soon be silent.

01:38:01.894 --> 01:38:05.728
Now, everybody eat
before Hallie's chicken gets cold.

01:38:05.797 --> 01:38:09.062
Pass the biscuits to Corporal McBurney.
Pass the mushrooms, Amy.

01:38:09.134 --> 01:38:11.898
Amy picked them especially for you.

01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:13.904
Thank you, Amy.

01:38:13.972 --> 01:38:18.466
Amy, I feel miserable
about what happened today.

01:38:18.544 --> 01:38:20.205
Anything I could do...

01:38:20.279 --> 01:38:23.009
to bring back your turtle,
I sure would.

01:38:23.081 --> 01:38:26.175
But you must understand,
it was the wine that...

01:38:26.251 --> 01:38:29.186
- turned loose the devils in me.
- I do understand.

01:38:29.254 --> 01:38:32.849
That's why I picked the mushrooms.

01:38:38.363 --> 01:38:41.161
Mmm... and are
they good, Amy.

01:38:41.233 --> 01:38:44.600
They taste of the woods
and the clean air...

01:38:44.670 --> 01:38:49.073
and mysterious shadows
where pretty elves dance together.

01:38:49.141 --> 01:38:53.601
What a romantic way
to speak of mushrooms.

01:38:53.679 --> 01:38:57.740
The first Union troops
I meet up with...

01:38:57.816 --> 01:39:01.650
I'm gonna ask them if they'll post
a guard around the school.

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:03.813
They do that for
friendly Southerners.

01:39:03.889 --> 01:39:06.255
What do you mean,
"meet up with"?

01:39:06.325 --> 01:39:10.227
I mean, tomorrow morning
at dawn I'll be leaving.

01:39:10.295 --> 01:39:12.729
[Edwina] I'll see that...

01:39:12.798 --> 01:39:16.359
he doesn't forget
to do that good turn.

01:39:16.435 --> 01:39:18.562
I'm leaving with him.

01:39:18.637 --> 01:39:22.471
We're going to be married.

01:39:26.645 --> 01:39:28.840
That's right.

01:39:28.914 --> 01:39:30.973
She asked me and I said yes.

01:39:31.049 --> 01:39:32.641
No, I didn't!

01:39:35.787 --> 01:39:37.846
Congratulations to you both.

01:39:37.923 --> 01:39:41.916
But have you forgotten
you're a partner here?

01:39:45.130 --> 01:39:47.894
No...

01:39:47.966 --> 01:39:50.799
and I'll be grateful
to you all my life.

01:39:50.869 --> 01:39:52.962
But I love him.

01:39:53.038 --> 01:39:56.064
I have to go with him.

01:39:56.141 --> 01:39:58.701
[Martha] It's only natural...

01:39:58.777 --> 01:40:01.075
but supposing you
do meet the soldiers.

01:40:01.146 --> 01:40:03.080
Whether they're
Confederate or Union...

01:40:03.148 --> 01:40:06.379
he won't be able to protect you.
What will happen to you?

01:40:06.451 --> 01:40:09.443
I've lived with the war
for a long time.

01:40:09.521 --> 01:40:11.887
It doesn't frighten me.

01:40:11.957 --> 01:40:13.788
We're spoiling everybody's supper.

01:40:13.859 --> 01:40:18.387
And Amy picked these mushrooms
especially for me.

01:40:18.463 --> 01:40:21.398
Edwina, will you have some?

01:40:21.466 --> 01:40:24.435
And pass it on to the other girls.

01:40:30.609 --> 01:40:32.736
Lizzie?

01:40:44.656 --> 01:40:47.352
No, Edwina!

01:40:47.426 --> 01:40:49.951
Don't.

01:41:51.823 --> 01:41:54.917
Oh, my God!

01:42:00.866 --> 01:42:02.800
[Crash]

01:42:02.868 --> 01:42:05.302
Girls, finish your meal.

01:42:24.523 --> 01:42:28.857
[Martha] Lizzie, that is not
the stitch I showed you.

01:42:28.927 --> 01:42:31.555
Watch how Doris does it.

01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:31.863
[Doris] See, Lizzie?

01:42:31.863 --> 01:42:33.660
[Doris] See, Lizzie?

01:42:33.732 --> 01:42:35.723
You run the needle
through both sides...

01:42:35.801 --> 01:42:40.204
then lock the stitch underneath,
like this.

01:42:40.272 --> 01:42:42.832
That's the way I did it.

01:42:42.908 --> 01:42:46.344
No, it's not.
Try it again.

01:42:46.411 --> 01:42:48.402
Doesn't look as if he suffered much.

01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:50.971
I'm sure he didn't, Carol.

01:42:51.049 --> 01:42:55.042
[Martha] I think probably
his heart just gave out.

01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.088
He was in a very weakened condition.

01:42:58.890 --> 01:43:01.950
I love you.

01:43:02.027 --> 01:43:05.087
[Lizzie] But I thought
the mushrooms killed him.

01:43:05.163 --> 01:43:07.791
You think I can't tell
bad mushrooms from good ones?

01:43:07.866 --> 01:43:12.963
And Mr. McB said himself
how delicious they were.

01:43:13.038 --> 01:43:15.063
Lizzie, Amy...

01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:17.608
open the gates.

01:43:17.676 --> 01:43:21.339
Come all you pretty fair maids

01:43:21.413 --> 01:43:23.506
Come walk in the sun

01:43:23.582 --> 01:43:26.915
- Do we have classes today, Miss Martha?
- I don't see why not.

01:43:26.985 --> 01:43:30.614
And don't let your young man
ever carry a gun

01:43:32.057 --> 01:43:35.254
Come all you young fellows

01:43:35.327 --> 01:43:38.353
Take warning by me

01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:41.763
Don't go for a soldier

01:43:43.435 --> 01:43:46.199
Don't join no army

01:43:47.572 --> 01:43:50.803
For the dove she will leave you

01:43:50.876 --> 01:43:54.573
The raven will come

01:43:54.646 --> 01:43:58.548
And death will come marching

01:43:58.617 --> 01:44:01.484
At the beat of the drum

01:44:03.154 --> 01:44:07.215
[Distant Drums]

01:44:24.509 --> 01:44:29.208
[Dove Cooing]
