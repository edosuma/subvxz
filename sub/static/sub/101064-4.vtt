between 1940 and 1960.

14:22.732 --> 14:24.107
MICHELLE: The height
seems pretty consistent.

14:24.190 --> 14:25.941
HAYNES: We knew that he was
roughly five-nine, five-ten...

14:26.023 --> 14:27.774
MICHELLE: He's anywhere from
five-eight to maybe five-ten.

14:27.857 --> 14:29.023
The shoe size
is nine and a half.

14:29.107 --> 14:30.649

in the Sacramento area

14:30.732 --> 14:33.190

14:33.273 --> 14:35.774
Everything else has just been
an unknown variable

14:35.857 --> 14:36.941

14:37.023 --> 14:40.941

of those was Visalia.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.982
Hello. I'm Scott Devenney

14:45.065 --> 14:48.065

I invite you to visit

14:48.148 --> 14:50.732
one of America's
hardest working cities,

14:50.816 --> 14:53.482

MICHELLE:
In the town of Visalia,

14:59.273 --> 15:01.065
there was this ransacker

15:01.148 --> 15:04.732
who I mean just down
to the strangest details

15:04.816 --> 15:07.941

the-- the East Area Rapist.

15:14.190 --> 15:16.315
MELANIE BARBEAU: If you look
at the Visalia cases,

15:16.399 --> 15:18.482
they're very much
things that he did

15:18.565 --> 15:20.732
-in all his rape cases.
-(EMPTY DIAL TONE)

15:20.816 --> 15:22.232
He took trinkets

15:22.315 --> 15:25.565
that would be more
of something personal

15:25.649 --> 15:27.732
and close to a victim.

15:27.816 --> 15:29.107
There were many times

15:29.190 --> 15:31.774
where valuables
were left behind.

15:31.857 --> 15:33.649
MICHELLE:
And the burglaries are all--

15:33.732 --> 15:35.691
they have one earring
taken sometime--

15:35.774 --> 15:38.732
just very specific things
that are very quirky.

15:38.816 --> 15:41.232
Both offenders used
the same specific phrase

15:41.315 --> 15:43.440
in phone calls they made
to victims,

15:43.524 --> 15:46.399
which was, um, "I'm going
to come over and fuck you."

15:49.524 --> 15:51.440
MICHELLE: The Visalia Ransacker
was really into

15:51.524 --> 15:53.941

15:54.023 --> 15:58.148
He would take out and leave it
just sort of arrayed around.

16:01.691 --> 16:03.691
So, you know,
it could be a coincidence,

16:03.774 --> 16:07.440

if it's not him, I think.

16:26.732 --> 16:30.565

to his real fantasy,

16:30.649 --> 16:32.232
which was rape.

16:34.899 --> 16:36.023
And I also think

16:36.107 --> 16:38.482
that the only reason
he left Visalia

16:38.565 --> 16:41.941
is because, um,
Bill McGowen saw him.

during hypnosis
