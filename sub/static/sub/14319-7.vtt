a working time portal?

00:11.291 --> 00:13.708
We rebels have a theory.

00:13.708 --> 00:16.875
If the assassination
of the '90s never occurred...

00:16.875 --> 00:19.000
Then none of this misery
would have happened?

gonna take place

00:43.708 --> 00:45.625
that's gonna ruin the world.

00:45.625 --> 00:48.958
It starts with
a single death,
in Washington, D.C.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.166
All mutants get blamed.

00:52.166 --> 00:54.875
If you prevent this
assassination,

00:54.875 --> 00:59.208
will the future

Then counterattack.
We're not retreating.

COMPUTER VOICE: It
is not Apocalypse.
Time is changing.

04:12.583 --> 04:16.416
Somehow, the past

Our present

response to a new past.

What can I do?

04:21.875 --> 04:23.708
There is nothing
you can do.

04:23.708 --> 04:26.000
As soon as the time
stream has realigned,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.875
you and your world
will cease to exist.

with a time traveler

FORGE: What do you mean?

05:20.625 --> 05:22.375
Nothing has changed.

05:22.375 --> 05:26.416
But I didn't fail, Forge.
I stopped the assassination.

05:26.416 --> 05:29.166
Then something else
must have happened
afterwards,

05:29.625 --> 05:33.375
something that has made
the future still turn
out like this.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.375
The plague still rages.

05:35.375 --> 05:38.458
What plague? There was
no plague when I left.

05:38.458 --> 05:43.458
Have you forgotten this?
Sickness everywhere.
Millions dying.

05:43.458 --> 05:46.833
After
Senator Kelly survived
the assassination attempt,

05:46.833 --> 05:50.750
he became president and
dedicated his efforts
to mutant rights.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.416
That was what
I went back for!
Don't you remember?

changed

At first, people sickened,
but they lived,

06:12.875 --> 06:15.833

the first mutant

06:15.833 --> 06:19.708

Let the world see that
mutants carry the plague.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.875
But you don't understand!

16:06.875 --> 16:10.125
Get him to the Blackbird
before he starts another
riot.

16:10.125 --> 16:11.625
(CREED GROANING)

16:17.833 --> 16:21.291
If you can't keep your head,
then you're no good to the
team.

16:21.291 --> 16:24.375
What did you think you were
doing, attacking Creed on
national television?

16:24.375 --> 16:26.375
Saving Beast's life.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.625
Creed had some
kind of a weapon.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.458
I heard it go off
when we were fighting,

16:30.458 --> 16:32.375
and then he got sick.

16:32.375 --> 16:35.625
A viral weapon could
be easily concealed.

16:35.625 --> 16:39.708
I set the computer
to record the broadcast
from the committee hearing.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.458
Computer, image scan mode.

16:42.458 --> 16:46.416
Closer. Stop.
Scan left. Closer.

16:47.416 --> 16:49.083
Diabolically clever.

16:50.458 --> 16:53.875
An ingenious
delivery system
for an airborne virus.

16:53.875 --> 16:56.833
Thanks to Bishop,
he infected himself
trying to get to you.

16:56.833 --> 16:59.833
They'll take
Creed for treatment.

16:59.833 --> 17:00.833
Let's follow them.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.416
Show me everything.
I gotta know what to do.

17:05.416 --> 17:06.500
Who is Creed?

17:07.708 --> 17:10.416
COMPUTER VOICE: The mutant
named Bishop remains the key.

17:16.416 --> 17:19.166
Jean, see if you can
locate Creed in the
mansion.

17:24.958 --> 17:28.125
JEAN: Not in the mansion.
Beneath it.

17:28.125 --> 17:31.958
A secret laboratory.
And something else
is in there,

17:31.958 --> 17:34.458
something with
incredible power.

17:34.458 --> 17:35.875
(JEAN SCREAMS)

17:35.875 --> 17:37.458
Jean! What is it?

17:37.458 --> 17:40.458
Hurry, Scott,
before it's
too late.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.583
Don't worry,
we'll stop them.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.250
Let's stop all the
yapping and get to it!

17:46.458 --> 17:47.458
(ROARING)

17:57.416 --> 17:58.500
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

18:01.958 --> 18:03.458
(SCREAMING)

18:03.458 --> 18:05.458
How do we get
down to the lab?

18:05.458 --> 18:06.708
Leave that to me.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.125
I'm sick.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.625
I need help.

18:18.375 --> 18:20.125
CYCLOPS:
Your game's up, Creed.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.083
We're here to put
an end to your plague.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.708
You led the X-Men here.

18:24.708 --> 18:27.458
You deserve to
suffer for your mistake.

18:27.458 --> 18:30.000
You can't talk
to me that way.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.375
I am your leader.

18:32.375 --> 18:33.708
(MAN LAUGHING)

18:35.291 --> 18:36.375
Fool!

18:36.375 --> 18:38.000
Apocalypse!

18:38.000 --> 18:40.958
APOCALYPSE:
You dare to claim
dominion over me?

18:40.958 --> 18:42.166
A mutant.

18:43.416 --> 18:49.583
I am
as far beyond mutants
as they are beyond you.

18:49.583 --> 18:52.291
I am eternal.

18:54.625 --> 18:58.083
Your powers are
useless against me.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.208
JEAN: Scott!

19:02.500 --> 19:05.875
Annoying insects!

19:05.875 --> 19:09.333
Nothing can
stop the Apocalypse.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.458
I cannot be harmed.

19:14.458 --> 19:15.416
(SCREAMS)

19:15.416 --> 19:18.416
Watch me and tremble,

19:19.583 --> 19:22.208
for I bring the purity

19:22.208 --> 19:26.333
of oblivion to your world.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.625
BISHOP: Look out!

19:29.333 --> 19:33.208
We'll stop this
plague or die trying!

19:35.958 --> 19:38.375
CYCLOPS: Get out of here
before the whole thing blows!

19:40.458 --> 19:43.125
CREED: Put me down.

19:43.125 --> 19:46.458
Remember, Mr. Creed,
a mutant saved your life.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
APOCALYPSE:
My beautiful virus!

19:52.000 --> 19:56.458
The mutant filth
have destroyed
everything!

20:00.458 --> 20:02.166
(ROARING)

20:04.708 --> 20:05.958
X-Men.

20:07.708 --> 20:10.208
No!

20:10.208 --> 20:12.375
Not Apocalypse!

20:12.375 --> 20:14.000
COMPUTER VOICE:
Because of Bishop,

20:14.000 --> 20:15.750
the plague never
infected mutants.

20:15.750 --> 20:17.875
Millions were spared.

20:17.875 --> 20:21.458
As a result,
antibodies key to
the future stabilization

20:21.458 --> 20:24.583
of the
mutant genetic code
were never created.

20:24.583 --> 20:27.583
Over time, uncontrolled
mutations developed,

20:27.583 --> 20:31.458
destroying the mutant race,
radically changing our time.

20:31.458 --> 20:35.375
If our future is to survive,
the mutant plague must occur.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.875
What do I do?

20:38.875 --> 20:40.625
To save my world,

20:40.625 --> 20:44.416
I have to
help Apocalypse
destroy a past one.
