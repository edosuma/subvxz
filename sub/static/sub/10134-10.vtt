I have to call my store.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.836
So, Rusty,

07:39.960 --> 07:41.836
what are you into?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.964
Cub Scouts,

07:41.878 --> 07:43.964
little league?

07:44.005 --> 07:45.299
To tell the truth, Mr. Tanner

07:45.340 --> 07:47.842
I'm kind of, uh, a loner.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.640
- Pass me the salt, will ya?

07:50.762 --> 07:53.640
- Yup.

07:53.681 --> 07:54.975
Thanks.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.398
Ow!

08:01.440 --> 08:04.818
That's for unscrewing

08:01.440 --> 08:04.818
the salt shaker, Mr. Maturity.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.487
It wasn't me.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.115
I haven't pulled that bit

08:07.528 --> 08:10.115
since junior high school.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.534
Okay, high school.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.621
Alright, it was

08:14.828 --> 08:16.621
last week at the Sizzler.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.458
You didn't

08:16.663 --> 08:19.458
have to hit me.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.126
Well, I'm really

08:19.499 --> 08:21.126
sorry, you guys.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.295
Uh, there's li'l a problem

08:21.168 --> 08:23.295
down at the store.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.046
But, uh, we shouldn't be long.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.466
- Come on, Rusty.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.466
- Mom, I'm still eating.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.009
Well, we'll take it to go.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.551
Aw, come on, I hardly

08:29.050 --> 08:30.551
got to know the little guy.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.886
Why don't you

08:30.593 --> 08:31.886
go on ahead

08:31.928 --> 08:33.680
and let Rusty

08:31.928 --> 08:33.680
hang out here with us.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.516
Alright.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.516
I shouldn't be long.

08:36.557 --> 08:40.854
Now, Rusty, you be

08:36.557 --> 08:40.854
on your best, best

08:40.895 --> 08:42.397
best behavior.

08:42.439 --> 08:44.691
- I'll be fine, mom.

08:42.439 --> 08:44.691
- Mm-hmm.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.862
- See you all later.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.862
- Buh-bye.

08:48.903 --> 08:52.032
More milk,

08:48.903 --> 08:52.032
please.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.785
Missing, you're missing,

08:52.073 --> 08:55.785
you're missing.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.620
I'll go get a towel.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.555
How did the tablecloth

09:13.053 --> 09:15.555
get tucked in my pants?

09:17.224 --> 09:20.435
I have never put

09:17.224 --> 09:20.435
anything down his pants.

09:24.189 --> 09:27.608
Alright. Once, at the Sizzler.

09:30.153 --> 09:33.031
Daddy, I wasn't finished.

09:35.450 --> 09:38.453
Boy, your mom and my dad

09:35.450 --> 09:38.453
really like each other.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.788
Yeah. Say, you girls

09:38.495 --> 09:40.788
want some gum?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.707
- Sure, thanks.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.876
Here.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.212
All of the accidents at lunch

09:44.918 --> 09:47.212
were really weird today.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.090
Oh, those weren't accidents,

09:47.254 --> 09:50.090
the salt, the milk

09:50.131 --> 09:54.886
the tablecloth, the gum,

09:50.131 --> 09:54.886
all compliments of the Rustman

09:54.928 --> 09:57.222
master of disaster.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.974
You mean you did

09:57.264 --> 09:59.974
all those mean, horrible..

10:01.017 --> 10:02.561
Did he say gum?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.104
He said gum.

10:05.564 --> 10:06.940
[screaming]

10:08.649 --> 10:11.069
You girls, better

10:08.649 --> 10:11.069
start flossing.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.655
What is your problem, kid?

10:14.697 --> 10:15.823
No problem.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.033
My philosophy is

10:17.075 --> 10:19.827
if you fall for it,

10:17.075 --> 10:19.827
you deserve it.

10:20.912 --> 10:24.291
Well, my philosophy is

10:20.912 --> 10:24.291
I'm telling!

10:25.333 --> 10:26.834
Steph, wait.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.253
Dad really likes Cindy.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.297
And she'll be back

10:28.295 --> 10:30.297
any minute.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.633
So let's just try

10:30.338 --> 10:33.633
to be nice to the little rat.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.176
Okay.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.264
Want some cheese?

10:40.557 --> 10:41.808
Hey, Rusty,

10:40.557 --> 10:41.808
your mom just called.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.268
She's gonna be

10:41.849 --> 10:43.268
stuck at the store

10:43.310 --> 10:44.769
for the rest of the day

10:43.310 --> 10:44.769
and she wanted me

10:44.811 --> 10:46.271
to put you in a cab

10:44.811 --> 10:46.271
and send you down there.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.315
(both)

10:46.313 --> 10:48.315
Aww.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.233
But I told her

10:48.356 --> 10:50.233
we couldn't do it.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.278
Is it the money?

10:50.275 --> 10:53.278
I'll chip in for cab fare.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.572
Take it out

10:53.320 --> 10:55.572
of my college fund.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.240
That's very

10:55.614 --> 10:57.240
generous, girls

10:57.282 --> 10:58.950
but I told Cindy

10:57.282 --> 10:58.950
we really want Rusty

10:58.992 --> 11:00.785
to hang out here

10:58.992 --> 11:00.785
with us, right, girls?

11:02.829 --> 11:04.038
I knew you'd

11:02.829 --> 11:04.038
feel that way.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.165
Come on, Rusty,

11:04.080 --> 11:05.165
what do you say

11:05.206 --> 11:06.207
we go out in the back yard

11:06.249 --> 11:07.250
and play some football?

11:07.292 --> 11:09.336
Sounds like fun, Mr. Tanner.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.465
I'll be back.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.722
You know, Russ, there's

11:20.263 --> 11:21.722
nothing like throwing

11:21.764 --> 11:23.600
around the old pig skin

11:21.764 --> 11:23.600
and get that guy-to-guy

11:23.642 --> 11:24.976
bonding thing goin'.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.312
Okay, I'll be Joe Montana,

11:25.018 --> 11:27.312
you be Jerry Rice.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.938
Could I be Joe Montana,

11:27.354 --> 11:28.938
Mr. Tanner?

11:28.980 --> 11:31.525
He's always been my idol,

11:28.980 --> 11:31.525
before I met you.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.319
Aw, Russ.

11:35.612 --> 11:36.946
Okay. On two.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.574
Ready, set,

11:36.988 --> 11:39.574
hut-1, hut-2.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.369
- Hike!

11:39.616 --> 11:42.369
- Go deep, Mr. Tanner!

11:42.410 --> 11:43.537
'I'm open, Joe!'

11:43.578 --> 11:45.830
Here it comes.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.040
You can get it,

11:45.872 --> 11:47.040
Mr. Tanner!

11:47.081 --> 11:49.292
Run, run!

11:47.081 --> 11:49.292
Dive, dive!

11:49.334 --> 11:50.709
[Danny screaming]

11:50.751 --> 11:52.837
[crashing]

11:52.879 --> 11:55.840
Watch out for that mud puddle!

12:01.804 --> 12:03.181
Too bad.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.599
You almost had it.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.186
You know, mud tastes

12:06.017 --> 12:08.186
worse than it looks.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.814
You mind if I hit

12:09.563 --> 12:11.814
the showers a little early?

12:11.856 --> 12:13.107
Good idea, Mr. Tanner.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.318
I'll get to know

12:13.149 --> 12:15.318
the rest of your family.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.735
Beautiful.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.489
[groaning]

12:21.700 --> 12:24.202
This is great.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.202
You want some stuffy, boring

12:24.244 --> 12:27.163
formal wedding at

12:24.244 --> 12:27.163
a 4-H club in Nebraska.

12:27.205 --> 12:30.417
Oh, and you want some tacky,

12:27.205 --> 12:30.417
rock-a-billy sock hop

12:30.458 --> 12:34.295
at Graceland, the world's

12:30.458 --> 12:34.295
largest souvenir stand.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.838
She didn't mean it.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.757
Alright, listen, if

12:37.215 --> 12:38.757
there's one thing for sure

12:38.799 --> 12:40.218
when the band

12:38.799 --> 12:40.218
plays our wedding song

12:40.260 --> 12:43.012
it has got to be Jailhouse Rock.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.556
You want the first

12:43.054 --> 12:44.556
words we dance to

12:44.598 --> 12:46.057
as husband and wife to be

12:46.099 --> 12:49.185
"Warden threw a party

12:46.099 --> 12:49.185
in the county jail?"

12:49.227 --> 12:51.563
People will choke

12:49.227 --> 12:51.563
on their chicken.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.147
Come on, you don't serve

12:51.605 --> 12:53.147
the chicken

12:53.189 --> 12:54.941
until way

12:53.189 --> 12:54.941
after the wedding dance.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.527
Oh, this is ridiculous

12:54.982 --> 12:57.527
all we do is argue..

12:57.569 --> 12:59.946
- Did you say chicken?

12:57.569 --> 12:59.946
- Yeah, yeah I did.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.281
Me, too.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.949
- We finally agree on something.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.949
- This is it.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.034
This is a start.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.034
We're building here.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.954
We have a foundation

13:05.076 --> 13:07.954
to build our life on.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.122
(in unison)

13:07.995 --> 13:09.122
Chicken.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.707
Becky.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.044
Tongue-town, USA!

13:16.588 --> 13:18.797
Rusty, aren't you supposed

13:16.588 --> 13:18.797
to be playing with Danny?

13:18.839 --> 13:20.467
This is where

13:18.839 --> 13:20.467
the action is.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.594
Hey, hey, hey, don't touch

13:20.508 --> 13:22.594
my hair accouterments, please.

13:22.636 --> 13:26.306
Here. Sit here

13:22.636 --> 13:26.306
and don't touch anything.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.183
- I'm touching the dresser.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.183
- "I'm touchin'.."

13:29.225 --> 13:31.144
Okay.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.854
Listen. I'm hip

13:31.185 --> 13:33.854
to you, wise guy.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.274
I know you pulled

13:33.896 --> 13:36.274
all those stunts at lunch.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.402
Since Danny likes your mother

13:36.316 --> 13:39.402
so much, I'm lettin' you slide.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.988
From now on, you respect

13:39.444 --> 13:41.988
people and their property.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.574
<i>- Capisce?</i>

13:42.029 --> 13:44.574
<i>- Capisce.</i>

13:44.616 --> 13:46.951
Thanks for setting me straight,

13:44.616 --> 13:46.951
Mr. Katsopolis.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.036
You're tough,

13:46.993 --> 13:49.036
but you're fair.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.705
Yeah.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.458
Alright. You're a good boy.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.918
Have a good day, son.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.173
Did you see that?

14:00.214 --> 14:01.800
That's how you gotta handle

14:00.214 --> 14:01.800
kids like Rusty.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.302
Ba-da-boom.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.302
You know what I mean?

14:04.344 --> 14:06.638
Give 'em a little discipline.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.638
They're like dogs.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.931
They respect you for it.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.976
Or they lock you

14:10.057 --> 14:11.976
in your room.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.645
(together)

14:12.018 --> 14:13.645
Rusty!

14:13.687 --> 14:15.814
(both)

14:13.687 --> 14:15.814
Rusty!

14:15.854 --> 14:18.692
(in unison)

14:15.854 --> 14:18.692
'Rusty!'

14:18.733 --> 14:20.401
(Stephanie)

14:18.733 --> 14:20.401
'Rusty!'

14:25.031 --> 14:27.826
Hey, Rusty, what brings you

14:25.031 --> 14:27.826
down to my neck of the house?

14:27.867 --> 14:30.537
I was just admiring

14:27.867 --> 14:30.537
your equipment, Mr. Gladstone.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.664
Well, I'm putting together

14:30.578 --> 14:32.664
a tape of my comedy act.

14:32.706 --> 14:36.626
I specialize in some pretty,

14:32.706 --> 14:36.626
darn, obscure impressions.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.918
Now check this out.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.630
This one is Mr. Woodchuck.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.591
[imitating Mr. Woodchuck]

14:40.672 --> 14:43.591
Hey, Rusty.

14:43.633 --> 14:48.262
Say, is that table

14:43.633 --> 14:48.262
made of...wood?

14:50.973 --> 14:52.642
Alright, alright.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.642
Check this one out.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.478
This one's great.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.478
You're gonna love it, Bob Hope.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.063
[imitating Bob Hope]

14:55.520 --> 14:57.063
Hey, I wanna tell you,

14:55.520 --> 14:57.063
that's wild though

14:57.104 --> 14:59.357
isn't it, Rusty, huh?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.526
Hey, isn't

14:59.399 --> 15:01.526
that somethin'?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.530
This is an impression
