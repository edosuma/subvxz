WEBVTT

00:15.183 --> 00:16.417
Previously on
The White Princess...

00:17.651 --> 00:18.886
The enemy of England,

00:19.087 --> 00:20.388
the York pretender!

00:20.488 --> 00:23.224
I want to find
his wife and child.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.758
What if I don't wish
to be your guest?

00:24.858 --> 00:27.161
Then you may leave your son
and freely return to Scotland.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.097
He will be tended to
by midwives.
No.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.198
We will
change our plan.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.566
I will give up my claim.
No.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.235
You can't deny
your birthright.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.370
And if you did, the Scots
and all of Europe
would abandon you.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.505
The only thing
that keeps you safe

00:37.605 --> 00:40.108
is if you hold fast
and they back us.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.476
Duchess of Burgundy
bids you come to Cheapside.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.712
They will never
let your brother out.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.180
Your only hope
of freeing him

00:46.280 --> 00:47.981
is putting Richard
on the throne.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.583
If you even
think there is a chance

00:49.683 --> 00:50.784
that that boy
is your brother Richard,

00:50.884 --> 00:52.253
then you cannot
hurt him, Lizzie.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.987
No.
They're poisoned.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.889
He puts poison
in my clothes
to make me sick!

00:56.090 --> 00:58.892
Stop it! Stop it, please.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.129
Quickly.
There is a fire.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.330
You must disappear forever.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.133
You would not go
against your husband
for a boat builder's son

01:05.233 --> 01:06.367
but you would
to save your brother.

01:06.467 --> 01:09.002
I am the son
of King Edward, the IV

01:09.137 --> 01:11.139
and I will have
the throne of England!

04:28.736 --> 04:29.703
Where is Richard?

04:30.438 --> 04:31.572
The Tower.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.341
We slipped out
whilst everyone
was sleeping.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.142
They're all exhausted
from the fire.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.477
Even the guards.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.045
Henry beat him
so badly.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.348
You must write
to King James.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.784
Tell him
we need Scotland,
we need his armies now.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.085
Duchess,
you have spies,

04:45.519 --> 04:47.388
set them to find out
where my son is.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.789
Edward must be with me.

04:49.357 --> 04:50.991
I will have them search.
Go and write your letter.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.895
Her child
is already dead.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.798
Do you think
it will help
to tell her that?

04:59.032 --> 05:00.634
I want her writing
to Scotland,

05:01.101 --> 05:02.770
not weeping
for her infant.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.372
Henry will kill
Prince Richard

05:04.472 --> 05:05.906
before our messenger
is out of London...

05:06.006 --> 05:07.007
No, he won't...

05:08.776 --> 05:10.644
I say we gather
behind Warwick,

05:10.744 --> 05:12.513
even if he is
simple minded...

05:12.613 --> 05:14.782
Lizzie will not let
Henry kill him.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.784
She knows he is her brother.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.021
Summon your men,
my lords.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.457
The duchess is right.
The time to strike is now.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.628
All this time,

05:28.729 --> 05:31.031
I thought you were
the petite  fleur tremblante.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.502
But now look at you.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.405
A blazing white rose.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.540
Be my eyes and ears?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.042
Cathy will stay here
with you.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.812
She has no reason
to return to Court.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.947
They will simply think
she's run.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.446
Wait here.

06:23.651 --> 06:26.987
I told you,
I told you over and over
that you must decide

06:27.087 --> 06:28.355
and you did not.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.257
The fire is an attempt
on your life,

06:30.558 --> 06:32.025
and the lives
of the princes!

06:33.193 --> 06:35.262
And the Spanish say
that you must kill him.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.997
He must hang.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.099
Yes, Mother.
He must.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.701
The Spanish?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.336
Their ambassador,
De Puebla is here.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.638
They will not grant
the marriage

06:44.738 --> 06:47.207
between Princess Catherine
and Prince Arthur

06:47.875 --> 06:49.076
until the boy is dead.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.512
And the Earl of Warwick too.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.616
De Puebla
said Queen Isabella
already told you this.

06:55.716 --> 06:56.717
Yes.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.753
Do you want
your son married?

06:59.853 --> 07:01.522
You can deal
with Warwick later

07:01.622 --> 07:04.024
but must get rid
of the pretender now.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.494
You have a charge.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.861
He set the fire.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.597
He did not set the fire.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.605
I did.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.508
What?

07:23.811 --> 07:24.878
Why?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.017
Leave us.

07:40.828 --> 07:41.829
Leave us.

07:43.764 --> 07:44.898
By all the saints,

07:45.533 --> 07:48.235
I wonder how you
walk in a straight line,

07:48.335 --> 07:50.604
your wits are
so dismally few.

07:50.871 --> 07:51.939
Lady Mother.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.116
I hoped he would escape.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.620
Escape.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.122
Yes.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.724
Why?

08:13.060 --> 08:14.862
Why would you
want him to escape?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.129
Because...

08:18.566 --> 08:19.466
Because...

08:19.733 --> 08:21.635
Henry, you must
not kill him.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.641
My mother called down
a curse on the murderers
of the princes.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.212
I knelt next to her, Henry,
I said the words with her,

08:33.914 --> 08:35.282
that the murderers
of the princes

08:35.382 --> 08:37.150
would never see
their own sons
grow to men,

08:38.719 --> 08:40.988
that their
whole male line
would be blighted,

08:41.088 --> 08:42.723
all of their sons,

08:43.891 --> 08:46.594
all of them, dead,
in revenge for the princes.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.764
You mustn't kill him.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.234
You mustn't.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.137
And you are saying that
this curse would fall on me

08:57.237 --> 08:58.271
because he is
your brother.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.610
He is Prince Richard.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.014
Our sons, Henry.

09:08.916 --> 09:12.252
Our boys.
Our precious,
beautiful boys.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.654
He is your brother.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.626
After all this time,
and now you tell me
that it's true.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.993
You cannot kill him.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.832
You must find
another way.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.934
We, we must find
another way.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.873
There is no other way.
There is.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.710
There has to be,
if we just think.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.685
Henry...

09:46.654 --> 09:47.655
Henry.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.221
- Arthur, stop it.
- Give me the arrow.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.695
I want the princes busy
at their favorite pursuits
today.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.564
They can do
what they want

10:31.665 --> 10:32.900
but they must be
kept occupied.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.668
Your Grace.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.706
I looked for you,
earlier.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.075
Before it was light.
I could not find you.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.111
I was here.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.079
I was walking
in the courtyard.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.783
The smell of burning
made me feel ill.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.254
Where is Cathy Gordon?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.391
I do not know, Your Grace.
I have not seen her.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.235
Oh, well done,
Prince Arthur!

11:24.985 --> 11:26.754
Senor De Puebla.
Your Grace.

11:31.458 --> 11:35.028
I carry a private message
from Queen Isabella to you.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.030
From one mother to another.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.200
She thought
you understood
each other

11:40.400 --> 11:43.336
and now she wonders
if you insult her
and her daughter?

11:44.004 --> 11:45.205
There is no insult.

11:46.774 --> 11:47.975
I have the matter in hand.

11:52.780 --> 11:53.847
Come.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.175
Move him to be with
the Earl of Warwick.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.813
Now.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.452
Your Grace?

12:34.888 --> 12:38.826
Scotland is
readying armies
to come against us.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.194
Who brought you this news?

12:42.162 --> 12:43.163
The New Clerk.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.334
Burgundy and Ireland

12:47.434 --> 12:49.837
wait for the tides
and the weather
to be in their favor.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.339
Well, my aunt
has been busy,
has she not?

12:54.507 --> 12:55.909
I require your assistance.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.847
Oh, Your Grace,
you must allow me...
No, my Lord Cardinal.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.748
You are busy

13:01.982 --> 13:03.550
and my lady,
the king's mother,
may need you.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.506
Him.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.346
Name?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.282
Noah Luff.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.549
Crime?

13:36.884 --> 13:38.051
Defilin' a church.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.089
Tutor him.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.124
He must be word perfect.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.593
Your Grace.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.930
The boy has been moved

13:50.030 --> 13:53.133
to the same cell
as the Earl of Warwick.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.367
By whose order?

13:54.467 --> 13:55.936
The king's.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.504
I will deal with it.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.207
If it's
the king's wish.
What is he thinking?

14:01.141 --> 14:02.575
The king should be
sending for his lords,

14:02.675 --> 14:04.044
he should be
marshalling his forces

14:04.144 --> 14:05.245
but instead
he sends for his mother?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.314
Who rules us,
him or you?

14:24.297 --> 14:25.432
Thank you for coming.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.834
You do not need
to thank me,

14:27.935 --> 14:29.269
I come as soon
as I am bid.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.439
Henry.

14:35.242 --> 14:38.445
Henry, you have moved
the imposter to be
with the idiot...

14:38.545 --> 14:40.213
You have eyes
everywhere.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.983
It will look
to your lords,
to everybody,

14:43.083 --> 14:44.617
as if you believe him.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.654
There's a symmetry to it,
don't you think?

14:48.956 --> 14:53.961
Then as now, two York boys
with a claim in the one room.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.665
The boy is
who he says he is.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.669
Then King Richard
was careless.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.579
And now
you must finish it
and get rid of him.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.549
It is what is necessary.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.385
Mother,

15:21.654 --> 15:23.390
I am of your flesh.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.393
You made me.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.064
I have been advised
by so many who do not know

15:31.164 --> 15:33.600
what it is to be standing
where I am standing,

15:35.068 --> 15:38.138
to make decisions,
to do what is necessary

15:38.238 --> 15:41.808
and I would be
counseled by you

15:42.442 --> 15:44.111
because I believe
that you do know.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.180
I know?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.319
Mother.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.591
I believe it was you
who killed the boys
in the Tower.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.397
No.
Your past actions
would resolve me,

16:06.099 --> 16:07.600
help me to do
what must be done.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.172
Was it you?

16:17.544 --> 16:18.711
Sometimes, Henry,

16:20.880 --> 16:24.284
politics takes place
under the cloak of night.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.053
You did it.

16:26.419 --> 16:30.057
There are things
that are necessary,
for the greater good,

16:30.157 --> 16:33.593
things that must be done.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.400
And now you are resolved.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.739
We will be together
on this, Henry.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.477
Let your mother guide you.

16:50.577 --> 16:51.544
There's a curse.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.580
What curse?

16:56.416 --> 16:58.651
Lizzie told me that
her mother placed a curse

16:58.751 --> 17:00.120
on the killer
of her sons.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.721
A blight on
their male line.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.390
No heirs.

17:04.824 --> 17:07.694
They will sicken and die.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.797
A story
to scare peasants,
but not a king.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.600
Elizabeth Woodville
had the craft,
everyone said so.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.102
The only craft
she ever had

17:15.135 --> 17:16.503
was making herself
pleasing to men.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.274
You've cursed my sons.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.277
- You've damned them!
- You!

17:24.377 --> 17:25.778
Their grandmother!

17:25.878 --> 17:28.115
You've put the mark
of death on them...

17:29.316 --> 17:31.118
You are a butcher
of innocence!

17:31.884 --> 17:33.520
You are a killer of children!

17:33.786 --> 17:36.356
Argh!
And now you have
killed mine.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.764
You're a monster.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.201
You should have
left me in France.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.604
I wish to Christ
I was still there now,

17:51.704 --> 17:53.640
and away
from your poison.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.679
She does not come near me.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.683
She does not speak to me.
She does not speak for me.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.452
Nobody listens to her.

18:05.718 --> 18:09.356
If you defy my orders,
I'll have your heads myself.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.569
Oh, I've missed you,

18:58.305 --> 18:59.739
Oh, I can't breathe...

18:59.839 --> 19:00.873
I have missed you.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.909
I have brought you
warm shirts

19:03.009 --> 19:06.446
and, um, fresh...
Fresh bread and
meat and apples.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.318
The duchess
of Burgundy is close by.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.253
Cathy is safe with her.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.857
Armies gather for you.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.228
This tower will be torn open
and they will carry you

19:21.294 --> 19:23.463
on their shoulders
to Westminster.

19:23.796 --> 19:24.831
I will walk.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.436
And what will
you have, Teddy?

19:30.237 --> 19:31.438
When we are freed?

19:31.538 --> 19:33.340
A dog.
A friendly dog.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.308
You may have
as many as you wish.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.845
A hundred dogs,
all of them friendly.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.425
What is it?
What's happened?

19:53.560 --> 19:54.727
King Richard was innocent.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.797
It wasn't him
who killed the boys.

19:57.897 --> 19:58.898
It was my mother.

19:59.732 --> 20:00.767
What?

20:01.000 --> 20:01.968
How does it work?

20:02.902 --> 20:04.371
The curse.
Is it both boys?

20:06.205 --> 20:07.073
I don't know.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.641
But it's one of them.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.612
Without a doubt,
one of our sons will die,
but which one?

20:12.712 --> 20:14.247
I don't know, Henry.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.721
She killed the rightful king
and put me on the throne.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.725
It's all been lies.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.728
Our boys.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.898
Our beautiful boys
are damned.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.435
Come.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.770
I want to show you
something.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.054
Who is this?

20:55.555 --> 20:57.290
His name is Noah Luff.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.960
He is sentenced
to be publicly
whipped and hanged.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.465
He has struck a deal
for a simple hanging only,

21:05.565 --> 21:07.500
with a good noose
so that it is quick.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.901
And coins for his wife.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.838
In return for what?

21:17.043 --> 21:19.679
I, Perkin Warbeck,

21:20.613 --> 21:23.350
the humble
son of a boatman
from Tournai,

21:23.650 --> 21:27.687
confess to a plot
to kill the king
and the royal family.

21:28.455 --> 21:31.257
I did falsely impersonate
the dead King Richard,

21:31.591 --> 21:33.125
Duke of York, and I...
Stop, stop now.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.361
Henry,

21:34.894 --> 21:35.995
listen to me,

21:37.397 --> 21:39.532
all that people talk about
is that there is
a prince in the Tower

21:39.632 --> 21:41.568
and that they are ready
to fight for him.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.637
So we show them
this man.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.441
This man
hangs at Tyburn,

21:49.842 --> 21:52.612
he confesses in public
and what do people see?

21:53.980 --> 21:55.415
Not a prince
but a criminal,

21:56.916 --> 21:58.017
a fraud,

21:58.685 --> 22:00.453
an imposter
telling his crimes freely

22:00.553 --> 22:02.422
and so the rebellion
is broken,

22:03.790 --> 22:05.958
there is no war
because there is no-one

22:06.058 --> 22:07.627
to put on the throne
instead of you.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.400
That man there is
"the other way"
we had to find.

22:15.635 --> 22:16.869
And then what?

22:17.136 --> 22:18.838
The boy stays in the Tower.

22:19.572 --> 22:22.775
A nameless prisoner.
He does not die, he lives
out his life there.

22:23.743 --> 22:24.977
I will not sanction this.

22:26.479 --> 22:29.916
Take him away.
The York lords will bring war
if they believe he lives.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.918
They are bringing it now.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.520
I have loved you, Lizzie.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.122
How I have loved you.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.558
I didn't know
that I could love.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.060
You have been
the grace of my life.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.531
But I never deserved you.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.436
And whatever happens,
you must be safe.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.774
Go to the Tower.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.043
Speak to him.

23:37.584 --> 23:38.585
Argh!

23:44.223 --> 23:45.892
Taken a tumble?

23:45.992 --> 23:47.794
That wasn't there
last night.

23:48.495 --> 23:49.596
Well, it's there now.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.173
Call my ladies.
I want to dress.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.209
There's no one outside.

24:03.643 --> 24:04.777
Of course there is!

24:21.528 --> 24:22.529
Where are they?

24:24.531 --> 24:26.533
Once you've seen
my lady, the king's mother,

24:26.599 --> 24:28.968
half-throttled
by her beloved son,

24:29.702 --> 24:32.539
you're a lot less willing
to jump to the stick.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.182
Find my ladies.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.985
Demand they attend me.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.855
I am still who I am!

24:49.055 --> 24:50.222
For now.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.960
All that power you had,
Margaret.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.095
All that hard
fought for power.

24:58.164 --> 25:01.100
Can you feel it all
slipping through
your fingers?

25:04.170 --> 25:05.271
Because I can.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.186
You have the look
of our mother.

25:24.591 --> 25:25.825
And that doesn't
please you?

25:27.994 --> 25:31.130
I loved her very much
but I didn't always
like her.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.267
I hated her ambition.

25:36.703 --> 25:37.937
What it did to us.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.608
Nothing else mattered
but power.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.109
She was a queen.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.245
And look where we are
from her ambition.

25:48.948 --> 25:51.150
I would like to ask her
if it was all worth it.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.153
Lizzie, two boys died
in this Tower

25:54.253 --> 25:55.688
but these two men
will not.

25:56.623 --> 25:57.890
We will walk free.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.226
We will be restored.

26:01.661 --> 26:02.762
There will be justice.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.633
A vicious wrong
will be set right.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.869
And what would
happen to us?

26:10.102 --> 26:12.271
Your children
are my nephews
and my niece.

26:14.306 --> 26:15.675
They will be honored.

26:17.644 --> 26:20.913
And you are the king's sister.
You will be a great lady.

26:21.648 --> 26:22.649
And my husband?

26:24.684 --> 26:26.052
He's a soldier,
isn't he?

26:26.753 --> 26:29.656
He has his honor.
He will fight
to the death.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.057
And that would be
the end of it.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.763
We would be widowed
and fatherless
but stay at court,

26:38.731 --> 26:42.669
no other factions
rising for children
with a Tudor claim.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.806
There would be peace.

26:48.374 --> 26:49.776
It is God's will, Lizzie.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.011
The bird took the bread!

26:54.113 --> 26:55.181
He took it.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.916
Oh, dear God.

27:00.386 --> 27:02.388
You are
so like my father
when you laugh.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.353
Henry?

27:35.154 --> 27:36.723
Henry, please.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.292
Henry?

27:42.094 --> 27:44.030
Henry, please open the door.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.432
Henry.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.057
Henry sees no one.

28:11.423 --> 28:12.491
Sits in darkness.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.361
His mind turns
against itself.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.931
His lords plan
for war without him.

28:20.466 --> 28:23.135
And Lizzie,
what does she do?

28:24.203 --> 28:25.537
Doesn't she have you followed?

28:25.772 --> 28:27.239
Of course,

28:27.339 --> 28:29.075
but her ladies
believe in Richard too,

28:29.175 --> 28:30.342
so they look
the other way.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.144
From King James.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.117
How does your son?

28:39.919 --> 28:42.855
Well, thank you.
The duchess' spies
hear nothing about mine.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.457
I'm sorry.

28:45.557 --> 28:49.228
When I am Queen,
Margaret Beaufort
will be shown no mercy.

28:50.429 --> 28:51.931
None at all.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.438
She's young.

28:59.538 --> 29:00.907
She will have
more children.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.217
Scotland
has been generous.

29:12.118 --> 29:15.487
Two thousand men
are waiting on the tides

29:15.587 --> 29:18.190
to bring my armies
and the Irish here
to join them.

29:18.457 --> 29:19.892
Yes!

29:19.992 --> 29:22.694
We will cut Henry's men down

29:22.829 --> 29:25.564
and all these years
of Tudor filth

29:25.832 --> 29:27.533
will seem nothing at all.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.537
I should go
before I'm missed.

29:32.238 --> 29:36.275
Your husband will be
among those loyal to Henry.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.179
He's loyal to me,
Duchess.

29:41.513 --> 29:42.548
Of course.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.891
You'd let
a Tudor loyalist live?

30:02.468 --> 30:03.569
You have to go to Henry.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.207
You must tell him
there is no curse.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.209
But there is.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.812
A widow and a virgin

30:13.913 --> 30:15.882
hurling oaths
against their enemies

30:15.982 --> 30:17.249
because words
are all they have.

30:18.017 --> 30:20.086
That is not a curse.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.056
Tell me,
my lady the king's mother,

30:26.225 --> 30:28.895
how do you stand there
in the sight of God
with that sin,

30:29.595 --> 30:32.298
that stain
of child murder
on your soul?

30:33.199 --> 30:35.434
We are going to
lose everything.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.904
That little boy
you removed
from Cathy Gordon,

30:40.306 --> 30:42.274
that baby
you sent away
for nursing,

30:44.911 --> 30:47.046
has he been nursed
into his grave?

30:49.882 --> 30:51.417
How do you sleep?

30:52.718 --> 30:55.321
How are you not
bowed down with shame?

30:57.489 --> 31:00.359
How do you not
howl with the grief
of what you have done?

31:03.029 --> 31:05.064
Was this always your plan?

31:07.166 --> 31:08.500
Get close to the crown,

31:09.635 --> 31:11.537
un-man the king
with some...

31:13.039 --> 31:15.041
...sour whore's trick

31:15.141 --> 31:18.044
so your family can
steal it back
for themselves?

31:19.578 --> 31:21.247
When have
I ever had a plan?

31:24.216 --> 31:26.118
Even now,
at my husband's orders

31:26.218 --> 31:29.521
I must broker the safety
of what sons I have left

31:30.422 --> 31:33.159
after the chaos
you have unleashed.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.268
Elizabeth.

31:46.338 --> 31:49.375
If you are not shocked
by what you will do
for your children,

31:51.510 --> 31:53.479
if you are not appalled

31:54.981 --> 31:56.382
by how far you will go
for those

31:56.482 --> 31:59.118
they drag out of you
while you screamed,

32:01.387 --> 32:03.990
then you are not a woman
worthy of the name.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.159
Mother...

32:47.466 --> 32:49.168
You're frightened.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.437
No, of course not.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.040
Are we in danger?

32:55.107 --> 32:57.109
Will we go
to the Tower?

32:57.843 --> 33:01.680
My darling boy,
no harm will come to you,

33:02.748 --> 33:07.153
not ever, not you,
my darling boy.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.544
Scorched brick
and burning wood.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.183
It smells of war.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.756
If I close my eyes,
it's as if I'm back
at Bosworth

33:44.856 --> 33:46.592
and no time at all
has passed.

33:48.227 --> 33:50.162
Bosworth
is a long time passed.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.101
You never knew
the truth

33:55.201 --> 33:56.735
of how your
uncle Richard died,
did you?

33:58.804 --> 34:00.306
He was beaten to death.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.709
No,

34:05.411 --> 34:06.378
not to death.

34:08.247 --> 34:09.415
Beaten, yes.

34:09.515 --> 34:11.817
Beaten and beaten.
But he wouldn't die.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.290
One eye stamped
from his head

34:18.390 --> 34:21.360
and the other
still rolled
and blinked.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.132
He was still breathing,

34:27.533 --> 34:29.135
blood bubbling
on his lips.

34:29.601 --> 34:32.138
The men
violated his body
again and again

34:32.238 --> 34:33.539
and I did nothing.
I...

34:34.573 --> 34:36.342
Didn't stop them.

34:37.709 --> 34:40.146
I saw that he lived
and I encouraged them

34:40.246 --> 34:41.647
to do what they wanted,

34:41.747 --> 34:43.149
like animals,
tearing at him.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.783
Please stop...
We rolled him into a pit

34:44.883 --> 34:47.753
and threw earth on him
and he was still alive
when it hit his face.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.421
And I thought...

34:51.290 --> 34:53.259
"Is this what happens
to a king?"

34:58.597 --> 35:01.400
He rises in the morning
and he is above all men,

35:01.667 --> 35:03.169
second only to God

35:03.269 --> 35:05.971
and by nightfall,
he is an obscenity

35:06.638 --> 35:09.641
of flesh
and splintered bone,

35:09.741 --> 35:11.810
choking on the mud
that stuffs his mouth.

35:15.247 --> 35:16.815
"Is this what happens
to a king?"

35:31.963 --> 35:33.332
And then
I put the thought from me,

35:33.432 --> 35:35.201
because the crown
was placed on my head.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.843
I believed I had been given
the right by God to rule,

35:49.315 --> 35:50.316
but I hadn't.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.421
I was never given the right.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.924
The peace
we have had
was hard won

35:59.425 --> 36:01.793
and now we are heading
towards another war.

36:05.731 --> 36:06.832
Did you go to the Tower?

36:10.602 --> 36:11.770
He says...

36:14.740 --> 36:16.542
He says we will be safe.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.313
I trust him
to honor his word.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.449
And the Tudor lords?

36:23.715 --> 36:25.451
And do you trust them?

36:25.551 --> 36:26.918
They will fight
tooth and nail

36:27.018 --> 36:28.520
till the whole country
looks like this.

36:28.620 --> 36:31.390
I'm trying to
protect my sons...

36:31.490 --> 36:33.325
The only way you can
protect our sons

36:33.425 --> 36:35.561
is by telling the world
you've killed the boy.

36:37.363 --> 36:38.497
You are the king.

36:38.597 --> 36:40.899
In name only.

36:42.268 --> 36:43.969
I wasn't given the right.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.474
The right is
not given, Henry.

36:50.276 --> 36:51.510
It is taken.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.746
It is taken by blood,

36:54.846 --> 36:56.882
by murder,
where is God in that?

36:58.750 --> 37:02.788
The king's divinity is a tale
men tell themselves
but the right is taken.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.591
It is taken by force,

37:06.892 --> 37:08.727
and held by force.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.897
So take the right, Henry.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.302
Take it.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.308
Bring him out!

37:30.649 --> 37:33.385
How can they do this?
How can she execute
her brother?

37:33.485 --> 37:34.986
I have to go...
I forbid it.

37:35.987 --> 37:36.988
They will have spies there.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.124
If you go,
you look like
a sympathizer.

37:39.325 --> 37:40.359
Perhaps I am!

37:45.831 --> 37:47.433
Are you carrying messages?

37:49.901 --> 37:52.037
You always said
you had no interest
in the court,

37:52.137 --> 37:53.505
that you wanted
no part of it...

37:53.605 --> 37:55.541
And I don't, but I want
my brother back!

38:03.649 --> 38:05.183
All my life
I have been good.

38:05.584 --> 38:07.486
I have been biddable.

38:07.586 --> 38:08.887
I've been quiet.

38:10.356 --> 38:11.490
I married
who I was told to marry

38:11.590 --> 38:13.659
and I thank God
every day for you, I do,

38:14.626 --> 38:16.562
but I will not
be biddable anymore.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.931
I want my brother back
and I will have him

38:20.031 --> 38:22.468
because the York lords have
what they've always wanted.

38:22.568 --> 38:23.902
They have a king

38:24.503 --> 38:26.705
and Teddy is free
to just be Teddy,

38:28.039 --> 38:30.609
not the Earl of Warwick
with a claim to the throne.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.513
He can just be my brother
and we can be happy.

38:37.483 --> 38:38.784
And our son?

38:42.754 --> 38:45.491
What of him
if you are caught?

38:50.862 --> 38:52.398
Do you even think of him?

38:56.802 --> 38:58.937
You must promise me
you will not go.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.875
You will not carry letters.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.047
You must promise me.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.096
My Lady.

39:28.434 --> 39:29.935
Christ,
how the mob stinks.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.806
Traitor!

39:38.544 --> 39:39.745
Your men are ready?

39:39.845 --> 39:41.079
They're ready.

39:41.947 --> 39:45.283
I do not want a single hair
on King Richard's head harmed.

39:45.651 --> 39:50.656
I, Perkin Warbeck,
the humble son of
a boatman from Tournai,

39:51.457 --> 39:56.161
confess to a plot to kill
the king and the royal family.

39:56.261 --> 40:00.866
I did falsely impersonate
the dead King Richard,
Duke of York,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.603
and I confess
my crimes freely.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.137
It's not him.

40:06.438 --> 40:07.906
Have your men fall back.

40:08.139 --> 40:09.775
It's not him.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.667
*

40:46.444 --> 40:47.513
They believe it.

40:56.888 --> 40:58.557
You're certain
it wasn't him?

41:01.459 --> 41:04.029
Find a way to get this
to the Spanish Ambassador.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.950
*

41:39.230 --> 41:40.566
Where have you been?

41:41.366 --> 41:42.968
I was settling
my son, My Lady.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.705
He couldn't sleep
for all the stories
of the hanging.

41:55.581 --> 41:56.748
What game
are you playing?

42:11.162 --> 42:12.297
I should greet him.

42:21.306 --> 42:23.241
Spain is being lied to,
Senor De Puebla.

42:57.275 --> 42:58.710
My aunt is in London?

42:59.878 --> 43:01.079
She was at Tyburn?

43:01.179 --> 43:02.380
They have had help.

43:02.714 --> 43:04.115
The duchess
and the York lords
had help

43:04.215 --> 43:06.051
from inside the palace...

43:06.151 --> 43:07.185
Your Grace.

43:09.655 --> 43:10.889
You tire
of the dancing?

43:10.989 --> 43:12.958
You tell us
the pretender is dead,

43:13.058 --> 43:14.392
but he isn't, is he?

43:14.926 --> 43:16.194
It's...
Of course, he is...

43:16.294 --> 43:17.528
Allow me

43:17.663 --> 43:19.965
to put it in the most
simple of terms.

43:21.132 --> 43:24.102
You want Prince Arthur
to marry our treasure,
Princess Catalina?

43:24.903 --> 43:27.238
Why should Spain
yoke its pearl

43:27.338 --> 43:29.975
to this rotting beast
that is England?

43:32.043 --> 43:33.912
You are supposed
to be the peace.

43:34.680 --> 43:36.081
Be the peace.

43:41.119 --> 43:45.691
I give you this one night
to consider what I have said.

43:52.430 --> 43:53.965
We have enemies, Henry.

43:56.968 --> 43:58.937
When they come,
we will be
outnumbered.

44:01.439 --> 44:03.074
You, Arthur
and Harry will die.

44:03.174 --> 44:04.242
No.

44:04.876 --> 44:06.311
He made promises,
he said he would

44:06.411 --> 44:07.578
honor you and the boys.

44:07.713 --> 44:10.949
Promises are always made.
And they are always broken.

44:12.083 --> 44:13.218
Always.

44:21.026 --> 44:22.227
We have to let him live.

44:22.327 --> 44:26.097
Or we will sacrifice
both our sons to the curse.

44:28.066 --> 44:30.769
My mother once said
that perhaps her craft
was just luck,

44:32.971 --> 44:35.073
good timing that
she called magic.

44:37.175 --> 44:41.913
But what is certain is that
men with swords are coming
and they will not stop.

44:48.419 --> 44:49.821
My aunt will not stop

44:49.921 --> 44:51.757
until they have a York
on the throne.

44:56.227 --> 44:57.829
There must be no York
left with a claim.

44:57.929 --> 44:59.130
That is the only way
to stop them.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.869
I bring news
of Lady Gordon's child.

45:07.505 --> 45:08.974
Don't open the door.

45:10.008 --> 45:11.142
No, no.

45:13.779 --> 45:14.946
What are you doing?

45:16.948 --> 45:18.649
Teddy is simple.

45:18.850 --> 45:19.818
He's an innocent.

45:19.918 --> 45:21.286
To them he is power.

45:28.026 --> 45:30.028
And we must take
that power from them.

45:46.878 --> 45:48.413
I've missed you, Lizzie.

45:52.017 --> 45:53.218
I have missed you too.

45:58.824 --> 46:00.091
Why have you come
to see me?

46:01.026 --> 46:02.160
Can I go home yet?

46:03.528 --> 46:04.830
We hoped you could
help us with a question.

46:04.930 --> 46:06.331
We wondered what

46:06.431 --> 46:09.367
you and Prince Richard
talked about?

46:10.101 --> 46:11.102
The plot

46:11.970 --> 46:13.104
against King Henry?

46:17.042 --> 46:18.844
He said I could have
a friendly dog.

46:19.845 --> 46:20.979
As many dogs
as I wanted.

46:22.848 --> 46:24.215
A hundred!

46:25.851 --> 46:28.353
Teddy, can you
write your name?

46:30.055 --> 46:32.123
I knew you could. Show me.

46:32.891 --> 46:33.892
Just there.

46:48.573 --> 46:50.108
You are such
a clever boy, Teddy.

46:54.045 --> 46:55.981
The Earl of Warwick's
confession

46:56.081 --> 46:57.883
to treason, Your Grace.

46:58.116 --> 46:59.951
You may read here
the details

47:00.051 --> 47:02.320
of his plot
with the pretender

47:02.420 --> 47:04.189
to usurp the throne.

47:05.891 --> 47:06.992
Lock that away.

47:08.226 --> 47:09.394
We never want
to see it again.

47:34.619 --> 47:35.921
What's happening?

47:54.672 --> 47:55.840
The Earl of Warwick?

47:56.074 --> 47:57.575
Why did you make him
write his name?

48:01.947 --> 48:03.214
He must be woken.

48:07.552 --> 48:09.020
Where is my sister?

48:10.588 --> 48:12.357
Must we call the guards?

48:16.627 --> 48:18.063
I'll walk.

48:19.965 --> 48:21.199
We will both walk.

48:26.637 --> 48:28.473
I know something
is happening.

48:43.254 --> 48:44.355
My lord?

48:45.523 --> 48:47.558
No. I don't want to.
I'm here.

48:48.226 --> 48:49.227
I'm here.

48:50.361 --> 48:51.997
We must kneel, Teddy.

48:53.064 --> 48:54.799
No, I don't want to.

48:55.066 --> 48:56.301
I don't want to,
I don't like this,

48:56.401 --> 48:59.337
I don't like it,
I'm scared, I'm scared...

49:00.138 --> 49:01.239
Stay back.

49:03.208 --> 49:05.143
Teddy, sweetest boy.
You must kneel.

49:05.510 --> 49:07.012
You must.

49:07.445 --> 49:09.247
Come.

49:10.215 --> 49:11.216
It's all right.

49:12.350 --> 49:13.351
It's all right.

49:17.622 --> 49:18.723
What did I do?

49:19.024 --> 49:19.924
What did I do?

49:20.025 --> 49:21.259
I'll be good,
I'll be good...

49:21.359 --> 49:23.028
You are so good.

49:23.128 --> 49:24.595
So good. Just look at them.

49:29.700 --> 49:30.935
I'll be good, I'll be good.

49:31.036 --> 49:33.471
You are good.
You are good,
so good.

49:34.205 --> 49:35.273
Just look at me.

49:37.108 --> 49:39.477
Over very quickly,
all over so very,
very quickly, good boy.

49:40.278 --> 49:41.279
Just look at me.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.481
What is it?

50:19.317 --> 50:20.718
Did you look away,
Lizzie?

50:22.820 --> 50:24.422
Did you
close your eyes?

50:32.563 --> 50:34.165
You closed your eyes,
didn't you?

50:39.470 --> 50:40.605
Yes.

50:45.243 --> 50:46.744
Only one coffin.

50:48.679 --> 50:51.282
So I am to disappear.
As if I had never been.

51:03.194 --> 51:04.429
A royal execution.

51:06.464 --> 51:08.499
Henry grants me
this dignity at least.

51:20.711 --> 51:22.347
Don't close your eyes.

51:25.383 --> 51:27.385
Because you know
what you do this day.

51:35.693 --> 51:37.495
You know what you do.

51:39.430 --> 51:40.831
So witness it.

51:48.239 --> 51:50.575
England receive my blood!

52:26.211 --> 52:27.212
Why?

52:28.213 --> 52:30.215
Why did you
give me no choice?

53:12.723 --> 53:16.294
The Earl of Warwick was
executed for treason
this morning.

53:17.995 --> 53:19.364
My aunt is returning
to Burgundy

53:19.464 --> 53:21.766
where she will live a life
of sober contemplation.

53:23.033 --> 53:24.535
Cathy Gordon is in the palace.

53:27.338 --> 53:28.573
She will become
a permanent part

53:28.673 --> 53:30.475
of my household
and I will care for her.

53:35.446 --> 53:36.914
Where is Prince Richard?

53:40.285 --> 53:42.653
Your husband begged
for your life, Maggie.

53:44.689 --> 53:45.890
He begged for you.

53:47.292 --> 53:49.560
We were moved
and we have
chosen to be kind.

53:50.728 --> 53:52.497
The curse will
come down on you.

53:54.665 --> 53:55.800
The curse.

53:57.535 --> 54:00.871
A widow and a virgin
hurling oaths
against their enemies

54:00.971 --> 54:02.206
because words are
all they have.

54:02.307 --> 54:04.842
You will weep
for your children,
Elizabeth.

54:06.544 --> 54:08.813
All your hopes destroyed!

54:11.382 --> 54:12.650
That is the curse

54:12.750 --> 54:13.951
and it is on you!

54:18.689 --> 54:20.425
Embroider something, Maggie.

54:23.027 --> 54:24.495
It soothes the mind.

54:39.009 --> 54:40.010
Teddy!

55:22.953 --> 55:24.622
And now, we will rule.

55:26.424 --> 55:27.725
King Henry.

55:28.726 --> 55:30.461
You will always be
by my side?

55:34.965 --> 55:36.401
Always.

55:38.969 --> 55:40.405
They are waiting for us.

55:50.147 --> 55:51.416
Greet your mother.

55:51.949 --> 55:53.818
We are one.
Nothing divides us.

56:17.442 --> 56:18.743
You have done us
great service.

56:20.110 --> 56:21.446
What is your name?

56:21.846 --> 56:24.014
My name is Wolsey,
Your Grace.

56:25.450 --> 56:27.284
You are in our favor,
Wolsey.

56:27.918 --> 56:30.154
You will stand with us
and be tutor to Prince Henry.

56:39.564 --> 56:40.731
*

56:49.507 --> 56:51.842
We welcome
the Ambassadors
from Spain.

56:54.178 --> 56:55.913
A great alliance
has been forged

56:56.013 --> 56:57.548
with the betrothal
of Prince Arthur

56:57.648 --> 56:59.283
and Princess Catherine
of Aragon.

57:06.491 --> 57:07.892
A triumphant day.

57:07.992 --> 57:09.694
Worth everything.

57:12.229 --> 57:13.931
You and I, Lizzie.

57:14.899 --> 57:16.501
We understand each other.

57:17.134 --> 57:18.736
What we will do.

57:19.637 --> 57:21.839
We are one
and the same.

57:21.939 --> 57:24.141
You are too close,
Lady Mother.

57:26.010 --> 57:27.512
Step back.

58:00.545 --> 58:01.646
*
