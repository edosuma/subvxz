[theme music]

00:08.176 --> 00:10.010
[phone ringing]

00:13.047 --> 00:16.950
Uh, my son told me that our
mom got picked up for speeding.

00:16.984 --> 00:19.053
Just a minute ma'am.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.254
It's a good thing
you caught her.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.823
I mean, these elderly
ladies in Dodge Darts

00:22.856 --> 00:26.026
have been terrorizing our
community long enough.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.895
Roseanne, maybe we don't
have to bail her out.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.631
We could just, like, pretend
we didn't get the call.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.266
Jackie, we've got to
get mom out of there

00:32.300 --> 00:34.235
before those other
prisoners start passing her

00:34.268 --> 00:37.037
around like a pack of smokes.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.539
Let me talk to the guy then.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.841
I did wear the blue.

00:40.874 --> 00:45.113
Sergeant Dixon-- J. Harris,
ex-officer, retired.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.915
We are here to retrieve our
mother-- one, Harris, comma,

00:47.948 --> 00:50.918
Beverly, female, Caucasian.

00:50.951 --> 00:53.954
I said, just a minute.

00:53.987 --> 00:54.788
Ten four.

00:59.127 --> 01:02.963
He said he'd be with
us in just a minute.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.532
I can't believe
mom was speeding.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.267
She does everything slow.
She walks slow.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.537
She eats slow.
She dies slow.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.539
All right, let's see.

01:11.572 --> 01:17.678
Harris, comma, Beverly--
she had a minor accident.

01:17.711 --> 01:21.449
She's fine, but we had to
detain her for drunk driving.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.616
What?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.185
That huge liar.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.720
Drunk driving--
that's a felony.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.457
It is a felony, isn't it?

01:29.490 --> 01:31.459
Well, I hope you didn't
find that drugs she keeps

01:31.492 --> 01:32.693
stashed up her butt.

01:36.029 --> 01:38.932
Oh, my goodness,
girls-- the way they treat

01:38.966 --> 01:40.934
an old lady who was speeding.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.203
Was she belligerent?

01:42.236 --> 01:44.705
Did you have to beat her?

01:44.738 --> 01:47.175
This has been so degrading.

01:47.208 --> 01:51.445
They even took my shoe laces and
belt so I wouldn't hurt myself.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.915
Well, wasn't there
a sheet you could use?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.751
Roseanne, why are
you so rude to me?

01:57.785 --> 02:00.454
What do you mean
by driving drunk?

02:00.488 --> 02:01.689
If you want to kill
yourself, that's

02:01.722 --> 02:03.957
fine, but have some
consideration for other people.

02:03.991 --> 02:08.095
We promised that car to DJ.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.330
It's not true.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.899
I wasn't drunk.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.301
What's going to happen to me?

02:13.334 --> 02:14.902
Uh, usually, on
a first offense,

02:14.935 --> 02:16.737
they give you probation
and make you go to AA.

02:16.770 --> 02:17.671
What!

02:17.705 --> 02:18.606
I'm not an alcoholic.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.974
I only had one glass of wine.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.576
Well, it doesn't
count as one glass

02:22.610 --> 02:25.078
if you refill it 10 times.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.614
Here's her mugshot, Sergeant.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.917
Oh my god-- can I
get those wallet sizes?

02:29.950 --> 02:34.588
Come on, Deano, Frank and
Sammy are waiting in the car.

02:34.622 --> 02:35.856
So if you can't
give me the picture,

02:35.889 --> 02:37.258
can I just get the
numbers off the bottom

02:37.291 --> 02:39.793
because I want to
play the lotto.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.696
[music playing]

03:34.982 --> 03:38.286
Well, I always wondered what
an AA meeting looked like.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.354
Yeah, should be interesting
to see how many of these people

03:40.388 --> 03:44.124
mom sends screaming
back to the sauce.

03:44.157 --> 03:47.261
This is so degrading.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.297
I don't even know why I'm here.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.098
Well, then let me remind you.

03:51.131 --> 03:54.268
Glog, glog, glog,
glog, glog, glog--

03:54.302 --> 03:56.136
I'm not an alcoholic.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.471
Yes, we know.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.373
We are only here to
get your license back.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.043
Relax mom.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.144
You'll have fun.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.014
These are party people.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.416
Hi, welcome to our meeting.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.683
I'm the speaker tonight.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.619
Oh-- oh, you're Margaret D?

04:11.652 --> 04:12.720
Mmhmm.

04:12.753 --> 04:20.227
Oh, well I'm Roseanne
C. This is Jackie O.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.763
And that's our mother,
Beverly Lorraine Harris.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.670
I'm going to powder my nose.

04:29.703 --> 04:30.671
Huge coke head.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.877
Well, I'm four years sober.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.446
How much time do you have?

04:38.479 --> 04:40.414
Oh, well, I'm three
months pregnant.

04:40.448 --> 04:44.418
So it's about two weeks from me.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.653
How much time you got, Jackie?

04:45.686 --> 04:46.754
No-- she's just kidding.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.389
We're not really alcoholics.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.424
Oh, well, you do know
that these meetings are

04:50.458 --> 04:53.260
only for people in recovery?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.195
Now Jackie, you don't
have to lie to her about

04:55.228 --> 04:57.898
how rough your life has been.

04:57.931 --> 05:02.169
She's 22 years old.

05:02.202 --> 05:03.737
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.373
We've all hit rock bottom.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.708
Well, I'm clean now.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.543
And what I'm most
proud of is that I

05:09.577 --> 05:11.512
was able to quit
drinking without gaining

05:11.545 --> 05:12.346
a ton of weight.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.688
Well, one day at a time.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.290
And a "Welcome Back
Kotter" to you too.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.692
[music playing]

05:30.097 --> 05:31.999
GROUP: Keep coming back.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.035
It works.

05:35.068 --> 05:38.305
Oh, man, how depressing
were those stories?

05:38.338 --> 05:39.940
That last guy was the worst.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.843
Imagine passing out
on the train tracks.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.545
You think he would
have learned his lesson

05:44.578 --> 05:46.213
after he lost that first arm.

05:49.316 --> 05:50.384
Come on, mom.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.820
Let's get your thing
signed for the judge.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.254
Mom--

05:54.287 --> 05:57.791
I'm one of these people.

05:57.825 --> 05:58.759
What are you talking about?

05:58.792 --> 05:59.693
It's true.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.194
I'm-- I'm an alcoholic.

06:01.228 --> 06:05.533
I just didn't realize it until I
heard all these people talking.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.667
Come on, mom.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.669
Is this going to be like
when you saw "Witness"

06:08.702 --> 06:11.839
and thought you were Amish?

06:11.872 --> 06:14.374
I drink every day.

06:14.408 --> 06:18.245
I'm drink whenever I'm alone.

06:18.278 --> 06:22.349
I am an alcoholic.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.985
My god-- I can't
believe all these years--

06:25.018 --> 06:27.287
mom's a drunk.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.558
Yeah, you think she
would have been more fun.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.860
[music playing]

06:35.362 --> 06:38.298
It's true, Roseanne,
this week of sobriety

06:38.331 --> 06:40.801
has been the best of my life.

06:40.834 --> 06:45.405
Every day and in every way,
I'm getting better and better.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.908
Of course, that's due
to my higher power.

06:47.941 --> 06:53.447
Oh, mom, thank you, but I
can't take all the credit.

06:53.481 --> 06:58.085
It's been so long since
we made gingerbread cookies.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.420
And it's very sweet
of you to take

07:00.454 --> 07:01.922
time off to spend
the afternoon with

07:01.955 --> 07:05.826
your old, alcoholic grandma.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.394
Yeah, well, mom misled me.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.464
I thought she meant
we would be drinking.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.132
You know, mom, just
last night Darlene

07:12.165 --> 07:18.271
was asking me if there was any
downside to drinking, at all?

07:18.305 --> 07:20.841
You're at a very
critical age, Darlene.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.877
You've got to look out for
these good time Charlie's who

07:23.911 --> 07:26.614
want to ply a girl with liquor.

07:26.647 --> 07:30.250
You could wake up with something
a lot worse than a hangover.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.219
That's true, Darlene,
because a lot of these guys

07:32.252 --> 07:35.188
don't want to leave
in the morning.

07:35.222 --> 07:38.759
And these days it's not
just the risk of pregnancy.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.462
A woman of the '90s has to
look out for the herpes.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.936
Excuse me, grandma,
there's, like,

07:48.969 --> 07:51.204
10 or 12 guys I got to call.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.642
Hey, hey, hey hey hey,
hey, you get back in there.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.843
No way.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.745
You said David and Becky
weren't going to be here.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.813
You didn't tell me I was going
to have to spend the afternoon

07:59.847 --> 08:01.248
baking with drunken hines.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.551
[laughter]

08:04.618 --> 08:06.453
What are you laughing at?

08:06.486 --> 08:09.022
Uh, Beetle Bill--
he's loafing again.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.391
Will he never learn?

08:11.424 --> 08:12.292
So what are you doing?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.527
Get rid of that beer.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.095
You are not allowed to
drink when my mother's here.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.731
Oh, geez Roseanne, don't
you think you're going

08:17.765 --> 08:19.166
a little overboard with this?

08:19.199 --> 08:20.433
No, I don't, Dan.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.002
My mother has a disease.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.772
And it's not one of those
good ones like lockjaw.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.640
It's a disease like cancer.

08:26.674 --> 08:30.243
Would you be making fun
of her if she had cancer?

08:30.277 --> 08:32.913
Like toe cancer or
whole body cancer?

08:32.946 --> 08:33.914
OK, you're right.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.215
I'm sorry.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.516
I'll try harder.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.118
Yeah, me too.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.486
Well, thanks you guys.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.691
There will be a little extra
hash in your brownies tonight.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.792
Hey, you two--

08:44.825 --> 08:47.360
I need someone to put
raisins in the eyes.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.135
You hold her down.

08:55.168 --> 08:55.969
I'll get the raisins.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.742
[music playing]

09:04.812 --> 09:07.547
Oh, you know, I
can't believe he

09:07.581 --> 09:08.982
is going to sit
out the Super Bowl

09:09.016 --> 09:10.984
because of some twisted ankle.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.320
Ah, football players today are
nothing but a bunch of babies.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.155
Man, you got that right.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.924
Dick Butkus would have
played without pads.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.426
As a matter of fact, I
seem to recall one year,

09:19.459 --> 09:23.030
he petitioned the league
to play without a helmet.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.965
Sissy owners wouldn't let him.

09:24.998 --> 09:25.866
That's nothing.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.234
You want to talk tough?

09:27.267 --> 09:30.137
When the Aztecs invented the
game, they didn't have a ball,

09:30.170 --> 09:31.338
so they used a human head.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.075
Come on--

09:35.108 --> 09:36.209
No, that's true.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.145
And they played for
weeks till everybody

09:38.178 --> 09:40.447
was dead, except for one guy.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.481
And they made him King.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.987
Now that's football.

09:47.020 --> 09:50.858
BEVERLY: You who--
we're here, Roseanne.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.225
Oh, gee, mom--

09:52.259 --> 09:53.193
what a surprise.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.028
I-- I-- I really
didn't think Jackie

09:55.062 --> 09:56.897
would be bringing you by today.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.000
You could just knock
me over with a feather.

10:00.033 --> 10:03.971
And wonder what I could
knock you over with, Jackie?

10:04.004 --> 10:06.139
Mom suggested that we stop by.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.409
Oh, by the way,
Roseanne, my bridge club

10:09.442 --> 10:10.443
is meeting tomorrow.

10:10.477 --> 10:13.781
And I'll need you to
drive me to Elgin.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.083
I was hoping you wouldn't
find this out, mom,

10:16.116 --> 10:19.853
but I'm wanted in Elgin.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.822
Oh, well, that's fine.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.624
It's just-- they
serve sherry there.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.194
And I didn't want to go alone.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.528
All right, I'll take you.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.363
Thank you, dear.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.933
Well, I drank so much
coffee at my meeting--

10:32.966 --> 10:34.735
I tell you I'm wired.

10:34.768 --> 10:35.568
Piddle time--

10:38.706 --> 10:39.606
I'm sorry.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.575
She insisted on
coming over here.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.477
But it's your turn.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.646
I have to make 50
pigs in the blanket

10:46.680 --> 10:48.548
for 20 pigs in the living room.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.353
Oh, thank god.

10:53.386 --> 10:56.523
I thought I heard your mother.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.491
Kind of like those guys in Nam
who still hear the choppers.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.897
Yeah, except for it's
more like those guys

11:03.931 --> 11:06.867
in Nam who are still in Nam.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.036
Oh, no-- she can't be here.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.437
It's the Super Bowl.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.305
I've got a pony keg
out in the garage.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.473
Well, you guys
will have to hurry

11:13.506 --> 11:14.775
up and drink it in two minutes.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.210
A pony keg in two minutes?

11:17.244 --> 11:18.111
Give me a break, Roseanne.

11:18.145 --> 11:21.581
We ain't in high school no more.

11:21.614 --> 11:25.252
Oh, that's usual,
someone's left his crunch

11:25.285 --> 11:27.587
on the kitchen table.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.322
Well, why don't
you let me order

11:29.356 --> 11:31.825
you some of that non
alcoholic beer I used

11:31.859 --> 11:33.827
to heat up from DJ's bottle.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.228
Well, you're busy
then, Roseanne,

11:35.262 --> 11:37.030
so why don't I just go
to the store for you?

11:37.064 --> 11:38.665
Oh, that's nice
of you, Jackie,

11:38.698 --> 11:40.567
but I'm going to go
to the store, myself.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.735
I have a lot of errands to run.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.771
I'll probably be
gone for a long time.

11:43.804 --> 11:47.941
Well, I'm off
to the super game.

11:47.975 --> 11:48.842
I'll flip you for it.

11:48.876 --> 11:49.843
Winner gets to leave the house.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.146
Call it.

11:53.180 --> 11:58.318
Heads-- All right, it's heads.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.286
I win.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.120
Roseanne!

12:03.723 --> 12:05.092
I hope none of
your friends mind

12:05.125 --> 12:07.094
you not being able to drink.

12:07.127 --> 12:10.597
Nah-- these Super Bowl
parties pretty much break

12:10.630 --> 12:11.865
up after kick off, anyway.

12:15.002 --> 12:17.004
The party won't be dull.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.371
I brought a chex mix.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.377
Say, that boy looks
like the Bishop

12:24.411 --> 12:25.745
boy who lived down the street.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.380
Jackie, do you think
that could be him?

12:27.414 --> 12:30.750
Yes, mother, that's him.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.953
I don't remember
him being that tall.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.955
He grew.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.057
Well, he used to have long
hair, though, didn't he?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.192
He cut it.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.460
No, I don't think that's him.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.494
You're right,
mother, it's not.

12:45.866 --> 12:49.002
Ah, these beer commercials--

12:49.036 --> 12:51.038
I don't like them one bit.

12:51.071 --> 12:54.007
They do nothing but
promote drinking.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.476
They are just saying
to the American public

12:56.509 --> 12:59.212
that if they drink
they are going

12:59.246 --> 13:02.649
to be like those fancy
pants hipsters in the ad.

13:10.690 --> 13:13.793
Now who really drinks
beer that cold?

13:13.827 --> 13:18.331
I mean, look at frost forming
on the inside of that mug.

13:18.365 --> 13:23.636
And why do they
pour it so slowly?

13:23.670 --> 13:26.306
You're right-- that's
one of the things

13:26.339 --> 13:28.408
ruining this country.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.443
I'm going to put up the flag.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.946
And I'm pretty sure
it's out in the garage.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.315
Good thinking, Dan.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.649
I'd better get out there too.

13:36.683 --> 13:40.120
I don't want Old Glory
dragging the ground.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.322
Is that Jackson Five
boy going to be singing

13:42.355 --> 13:43.857
at the intermission this year?

13:43.891 --> 13:46.994
He's wonderful
with the children.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.362
[music playing]

13:52.866 --> 13:55.768
[cheering]

13:55.802 --> 13:57.804
Oh, man, he's good.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.638
Gotcha!

14:01.641 --> 14:04.878
Oh, man, we've been on
here for over an hour.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.113
We'd better go back inside.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.580
Are you crazy, man?

14:10.383 --> 14:12.619
She's in there.

14:12.652 --> 14:17.024
Bev-- beverage.

14:17.057 --> 14:20.961
Non alcoholic
beverage is in there.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.695
You know, Roseanne's going
to be back really soon.

14:22.729 --> 14:23.796
And she's going
to be mad when she

14:23.830 --> 14:24.932
finds out we've been drinking.

14:24.965 --> 14:30.770
Oh, yeah-- well, she
will never be the wiser.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.572
Breath mints--

14:32.605 --> 14:37.877
Breath mints-- that is
just crazy enough to work.

14:37.911 --> 14:40.013
One breath mint--

14:40.047 --> 14:41.448
Damn!

14:41.481 --> 14:42.415
Damn!

14:42.449 --> 14:44.284
Damn it all to hell!

14:49.222 --> 14:51.624
BEVERLY: You who--
are you in there?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.360
Oh, god-- too late.
It's her.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.261
Here she comes.

14:57.697 --> 15:03.436
[burp]

15:03.470 --> 15:05.538
One, two, three--

15:05.572 --> 15:07.807
ALL (SINGING): For she's
a jolly good fellow,

15:07.840 --> 15:14.081
for she's a jolly good fellow,
for she's a jolly good fellow--

15:14.114 --> 15:16.749
A party for me?

15:16.783 --> 15:21.088
Yeah, a party for
you to celebrate.

15:21.121 --> 15:28.295
Celebrate-- celebrate
five days of not drinking.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.262
Hear, hear--

15:29.296 --> 15:30.697
Woohoo!

15:30.730 --> 15:32.132
Yeah!

15:32.165 --> 15:35.969
You're all drunk!

15:36.003 --> 15:37.637
Well, yeah, it's a party.

15:42.475 --> 15:46.346
I can't believe you
would do this to me.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.780
No one cares.

15:47.814 --> 15:51.118
No one cares.

15:51.151 --> 15:56.156
Man, she is an ugly sober.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.791
Well, better go look for her.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.228
You know what, Dan?

16:01.261 --> 16:02.729
She's not a jolly good fellow.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.903
Well, looky who's home.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.772
Looky who's home.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.076
Oh, well, you said that already.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.678
You know, mom just
said the funniest thing.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.181
She said that you guys
were all drunk out there.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.816
And I said, well, that
cannot possibly be because I

16:23.850 --> 16:26.619
specifically told them that they
cannot drink when mothers here.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.689
And they cannot be drunk
because if they were drunk,

16:29.722 --> 16:32.092
then me doing this would
make you both want to puke.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.494
Stop-- please stop.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.196
You can't do one thing.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.331
You cannot stay sober
while my mother,

16:38.365 --> 16:40.067
the alcoholic, is in the house.

16:40.100 --> 16:44.104
Oh, please, Roseanne--

16:44.137 --> 16:46.706
your mother is not an alcoholic.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.608
I drink way more than she does.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.177
Do I look like an
alcoholic to you?

16:53.213 --> 16:56.015
I'm over here, Dan.

16:56.049 --> 16:56.983
OK.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.652
So we had a little drink.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.587
It's a special day.

17:04.191 --> 17:09.296
We had just enough to enhance
this very special occasion.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.297
Isn't that right, Jackie?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.705
Jackie--

17:18.738 --> 17:21.108
Well, here, let
me help you, Dan.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.243
Yes, we just had
a little to drink.

17:26.846 --> 17:33.353
How can I make you
understand the importance

17:33.386 --> 17:34.521
of Super Bowl Sunday?

17:45.665 --> 17:49.869
Perhaps the answer will
come to me in a dream.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.738
Why don't you just
lay on the floor, Dan,

17:51.771 --> 17:54.307
and save yourself that
embarrassing fall off the bed.

17:58.778 --> 17:59.946
Are you OK, mom?

17:59.979 --> 18:01.013
Yes.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.482
I'm just warning your
son about what can

18:02.515 --> 18:04.016
happen when you drink too much.

18:04.050 --> 18:07.920
He is what can happen
when you drink too much.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.856
Mom, is dad an alcoholic?

18:09.889 --> 18:11.524
What have you
been telling him?

18:11.558 --> 18:12.925
Only the truth.

18:12.959 --> 18:16.163
And if your father doesn't
get help he's going to die.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.630
I don't want dad to die.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.532
Oh, he's not going to die, DJ.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.433
Go check for yourself.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.101
He's in the bedroom.

18:22.135 --> 18:25.705
Make sure he's not
sleeping on his back.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.640
I don't see any point
in lying to the boy.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.943
He's going to have to face the
ugly truth sooner or later.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.346
Dan is not an alcoholic, mom.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.814
Considering the life
he leads, I don't

18:34.847 --> 18:38.285
think he drinks nearly enough.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.253
Oh, of course you think that.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.354
You're in denial.

18:41.388 --> 18:44.257
Your whole family is
completely dysfunctional

18:44.291 --> 18:46.493
because of an alcoholic
father and a mother

18:46.526 --> 18:49.028
who's nothing but an enabler.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.863
Well, that must have
been tough for you mom.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.733
You know, they say the first
step is admitting that everyone

18:53.766 --> 18:56.669
else has a problem.

18:56.703 --> 19:00.673
Oh, fine-- just
dismiss me, Roseanne.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.041
I'll just go on home.

19:02.074 --> 19:05.545
And maybe I'll have a drink.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.946
Oh, come on--

19:06.979 --> 19:08.648
I'm serious.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.082
I did yesterday.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.418
What?

19:11.451 --> 19:14.721
Well, I asked you to stay
with me until the news was over,

19:14.754 --> 19:16.756
but you had to hurry home.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.859
And I felt very lonely
and had a drink.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.299
Get out.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.133
What?

19:30.069 --> 19:32.239
I want you to get out of
here before I have a drink.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.274
You're not just an
alcoholic, you're a carrier.

19:38.478 --> 19:42.982
You can't understand what
I'm going through, Roseanne.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.784
I have no control.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.486
That is a lot of bull.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.488
Ever since you became
this huge victim,

19:48.521 --> 19:50.757
you've got control
over everybody.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.492
I'm an alcoholic, Roseanne.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.727
Don't you realize
what that means?

19:54.761 --> 19:56.195
Yeah, I know exactly
what that means, mom.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.498
That means you drink
like you always drank.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.099
Only now, you're calling
yourself an alcoholic

20:00.132 --> 20:01.434
because you think
that way you don't

20:01.468 --> 20:04.170
have to take any responsibility
for anything that you do.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.639
Well, goodbye.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.475
I should have expected this.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.610
They told me that
the people around me

20:10.643 --> 20:13.346
might want me to fail.

20:13.380 --> 20:18.718
I guess my real family is at AA.

20:18.751 --> 20:19.886
Keep going home.

20:19.919 --> 20:20.720
It works.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.696
You know mom, just
last night Darlene

20:29.729 --> 20:33.533
was asking me if there was any
downside to drinking, at all?

20:37.437 --> 20:41.374
You're at a very
critical age, Darlene.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.711
You've got to look out for
these good time Johnny's who

20:44.744 --> 20:46.646
are going to try to
ply you with liquor.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.629
Oh, I'm in trouble now.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.833
CREW: All right, here we go.

21:06.866 --> 21:07.767
Stand by--

21:07.800 --> 21:08.601
OK.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.471
CREW: OK.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.373
We'll take it from Roseanne--

21:16.909 --> 21:18.578
here we go.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.980
Stand by-- in five--

21:24.083 --> 21:26.686
Sorry, don't get me started.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.555
CREW: OK, you turning--
turn a little bit.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.222
Sure.
CREW: Here we go.

21:30.256 --> 21:33.726
Stand by-- in five,
four, three, two--

21:33.760 --> 21:36.228
You know mom, just
last night Darlene

21:36.262 --> 21:39.799
was asking me if there was any
downside to drinking, at all?

21:46.038 --> 21:48.675
