00:03.580 --> 00:05.290
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:05.290 --> 00:06.750
I'm Jacqueline Roa,
Isaac's ex-wife.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.120
Your situation
is triggering him.

00:08.120 --> 00:09.460
Did you give Stella
those drugs?

00:09.460 --> 00:10.710
Jacqueline, this is
Annalise Keating!

00:10.710 --> 00:11.880
I swear to God,
put the phone down!

00:11.880 --> 00:13.540
Ask him about Stella.

00:13.540 --> 00:15.880
How'd you know
Christophe?

00:15.880 --> 00:18.290
Get the hell out of here!

00:18.290 --> 00:19.250
You have more than
enough plaintiffs.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.000
I want to make him
my face case!

00:21.000 --> 00:22.750
-He's in.
-There's no chance in hell

00:22.750 --> 00:24.670
the Supreme Court is
going to hear this case!

00:24.670 --> 00:26.170
-You just need to ask for help!

00:28.580 --> 00:30.540
Annalise:
The Department of Justice

00:30.540 --> 00:33.670
recommends a maximum
of 150 cases at a time,

00:33.670 --> 00:36.710
but the PD's in Pennsylvania
carry a load of over 200.

00:36.710 --> 00:39.000
This is an issue for the
state legislature, Ms. Keating.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.120
Public defenders need to
demand better funding.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.670
But the money isn't there,
thus leading to long-term,

00:43.670 --> 00:45.620
systematic violations
of the Sixth Amendment.

00:45.620 --> 00:48.670
But the justices in Pennsylvania
wrote that forcing counties

00:48.670 --> 00:51.750
to provide more funding violates
the separation of powers.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.250
In Johnson v. Zerbst,

00:53.250 --> 00:55.750
this Court established
Sixth Amendment violations,

00:55.750 --> 00:58.000
not as a states' issue
or federal issue,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.250
but a human-rights issue.

00:59.250 --> 01:02.080
Believe me, Noah,
I am thrilled

01:02.080 --> 01:04.040
for any chance
to argue a case

01:04.040 --> 01:05.330
in front of our nation's
greatest court.

01:05.330 --> 01:07.000
You've won four cases
there before.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.830
Because I study the Court
and its nuances,

01:09.830 --> 01:11.750
and the only reason they agreed
to even hear this case

01:11.750 --> 01:14.420
is because Ms. Keating has
made friends with some
very influential people.

01:14.420 --> 01:16.120
You're referring to
President Fitzgerald Grant?

01:16.120 --> 01:17.830
Amongst others.

01:17.830 --> 01:20.420
I can't believe that
you're on a first-name
basis with Olivia Pope.

01:20.420 --> 01:21.960
I know her name.
I doubt she remembers mine.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.290
Look, I'm just saying we all
have enough to feel guilty about

01:24.290 --> 01:25.420
without you adding that
to the pile.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.580
What does that mean?

01:28.580 --> 01:30.080
"We all have enough
to feel guilty about"?

01:30.080 --> 01:32.710
Simon, Wes,
all the murder.

01:32.710 --> 01:35.750
Look.
It's nice that you feel bad

01:35.750 --> 01:37.380
about stealing the case
from Connor,

01:37.380 --> 01:39.040
but it was your idea
to on-board the Pope.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.790
And besides, what were
you supposed to do?

01:40.790 --> 01:43.960
Tell AK to send Connor
to D.C. instead of you?

01:43.960 --> 01:46.380
I mean, what kind of lean-out
crap would that be

01:48.960 --> 01:50.420
Of course
you get to be mad.

01:50.420 --> 01:53.210
Class action was never about me.
It's about the plaintiffs.

01:53.210 --> 01:56.250
Well, then, prove it and come
to D.C. with the rest of us.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.380
I have to beg the dean
to let me re-enroll.

01:59.670 --> 02:02.790
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to watch Annalise

02:02.790 --> 02:05.170
yell at a bunch
of old white dudes!

02:05.170 --> 02:06.960
And we could
check out the monuments

02:06.960 --> 02:09.580
and go look for closet cases
on the Hill.

02:09.580 --> 02:10.420
Okay, fine. I'll go.

02:10.420 --> 02:12.710
Yay!

02:12.710 --> 02:13.920
Field trip! Mwah!

02:13.920 --> 02:16.290
-Yay.

02:16.290 --> 02:18.170
Annalise: These
Sixth Amendment violations

02:18.170 --> 02:19.620
are a form of
disenfranchisement,

02:19.620 --> 02:21.620
primarily affecting
people of color.

02:21.620 --> 02:24.670
Are you implying that
the Commonwealth intended

02:24.670 --> 02:27.500
its denial of state funding to
have a racially biased effect?

02:27.500 --> 02:29.920
I'm not implying it.
I'm flat-out stating it.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.250
6.5% of Americans
are black men,

02:32.250 --> 02:34.580
and yet they account for 40%
of the prison population.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.790
Stop. You list those
statistics in your brief.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.290
Refer the Justices there

02:38.290 --> 02:40.750
so you don't waste a second
of your 30 minutes.

02:40.750 --> 02:43.460
I can't say it enough --
every word matters.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.750
Annalise!

02:49.750 --> 02:52.580
Oh, sorry.

02:52.580 --> 02:55.880
I thought they stopped
the investigation into Isaac.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.420
Bonnie: They did.

02:57.420 --> 02:59.920
Then why can't we get
his testimony reinstated?

02:59.920 --> 03:03.880
Isaac isn't
a reliable expert anymore.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.380
-That's all I can tell you.

03:06.380 --> 03:08.380
But even if our states
could find

03:08.380 --> 03:10.380
more funding
for public defenders,

03:10.380 --> 03:12.500
what about using that money
for our schools?

03:12.500 --> 03:13.920
Or housing
for the homeless?

03:13.920 --> 03:15.620
What about the millions
of children in the

03:15.620 --> 03:17.210
foster-care system that
are wards of the state?

03:17.210 --> 03:18.380
I'm sorry you're
not there with her.

03:18.380 --> 03:21.000
Or women who depend
on state funds

03:21.000 --> 03:22.790
to escape
battered housing.

03:22.790 --> 03:24.540
And let's not forget --

03:24.540 --> 03:27.380
my opposing counsel was just
a criminal defendant herself.

03:27.380 --> 03:29.710
Ms. Keating was cleared
of all charges.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.920
In fact, she says that it was
her own experience in jail

03:31.920 --> 03:33.710
that inspired
this class action.

03:33.710 --> 03:35.330
Well, I would make up
that story, too,

03:35.330 --> 03:36.580
if I were in her shoes.
Look what just came.

03:36.580 --> 03:38.420
Ohh. Is he trying
to win you back?

03:38.420 --> 03:40.620
It's for you.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.080
...agree that it's beneficial
to rid our prisons

03:42.080 --> 03:43.710
of people
who don't deserve...

03:43.710 --> 03:46.880
...draw the line
between guilty...

03:46.880 --> 03:51.330
Hmm. You should hide that before
I find a way to shotgun it.

03:51.330 --> 03:52.830
Explain to me how

03:52.830 --> 03:54.880
someone who was just fired
from teaching the law

03:54.880 --> 03:56.960
can be entrusted to change it.
It's ludicrous.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.460
She's trying to
get in your head.

03:58.460 --> 03:59.790
I've heard worse.

03:59.790 --> 04:02.330
And then,
there is Olivia Pope,

04:02.330 --> 04:04.830
a woman well known for
finding ways around the law,

04:04.830 --> 04:06.670
not protecting it.

04:06.670 --> 04:09.540
So my concern is that
these two women,

04:09.540 --> 04:11.580
claiming to fight
for the poor,

04:11.580 --> 04:13.620
might actually
just be using this case

04:13.620 --> 04:16.120
to distract us from
their own criminal acts.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.380
Let's not go

There's no such thing

Annalise appealed
the state's decision,

04:48.120 --> 04:51.460
and the Supreme Court
agreed to hear your case.

04:51.460 --> 04:53.670
That means she needs you
at the table with her.

04:53.670 --> 04:56.880
No way the warden's gonna
approve me leaving here.

34:13.620 --> 34:17.580
Ms. Keating has pulled
a bait-and-switch on this Court.

34:17.580 --> 34:20.580
The minute she made race
the determining factor,

34:20.580 --> 34:22.170
she took it out of the
purview of this trial...

34:22.170 --> 34:24.000
Go to the library and
look up this ruling.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.040
-Okay.
-Michaela.

34:25.040 --> 34:27.040
We lose without it.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.920
Ingrid: ...race but
on the expertise of
the individual attorney.

34:29.920 --> 34:33.250
In Washington v. Davis,
your predecessors decided

34:33.250 --> 34:36.580
that even if a law has
a discriminatory effect,

34:36.580 --> 34:37.750
it is unconstitutional...
You did your best.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.920
if that was not
its intended purpose.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.500
If that is the precedent that
Ms. Keating wants to challenge,

34:41.500 --> 34:43.330
then that case
needed to be built

34:43.330 --> 34:45.920
and argued in the
state appellate courts.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.330
Bryant v. Topeka.
Topeka means Kansas,

34:47.330 --> 34:49.500
which means it has to be
in the 10th circuit.

34:49.500 --> 34:52.330
So I'll start with
the indexes from '82.

34:52.330 --> 34:54.420
You start with '87, and we'll
meet somewhere in the middle.

34:55.580 --> 34:56.880
Why are you looking

Justice Spivey:
Washington v. Davis was

35:02.920 --> 35:05.290
decided on a technical issue
of the lower courts

35:05.290 --> 35:07.500
for not applying
appropriate legal standards.

35:07.500 --> 35:10.540
Ingrid: While Ms. Keating's
statistics make it clear

35:10.540 --> 35:13.080
that our judicial system
should be reformed,

35:13.080 --> 35:14.710
that is not the duty
of this Court today.
