(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

00:34.619 --> 00:35.825
Come on in.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.279
I'm not doing any more chemo.

00:46.631 --> 00:47.666
Good plan.

00:48.466 --> 00:50.127
You'll be dead
in five months.

00:53.137 --> 00:55.799
We went for a cure,
it didn't work.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.715
I've thought
about this a lot.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.970
Five more months on
this Earth is reasonable.

01:01.187 --> 01:05.647
A year in the hospital
in excruciating pain is

01:08.152 --> 01:09.312
not.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.776
With two weeks on,
two weeks off of chemo,

01:11.906 --> 01:13.897
you could have way
more than a year.

01:14.325 --> 01:16.407
Maybe two or three.

01:16.494 --> 01:17.483
House.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.403
I'm sorry.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.495
I'm not gonna
let you just die.

02:20.599 --> 02:21.930
Hey.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.515
You know, management
research shows that

02:23.602 --> 02:26.139
the best ideas come
from casual contact.

02:26.647 --> 02:30.105
So, one set of season tickets.

02:30.735 --> 02:31.895
I got the seat next to you.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.402
First game is October 8th.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.982
It's about one month
after Wilson's
expiration date.

02:39.452 --> 02:41.534
This isn't
an unstructured collaboration.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.326
You're trying to
be the new Wilson.

02:43.414 --> 02:45.996
I'm trying to show you
there are other
people who care about you.

02:46.584 --> 02:50.122
Relax. I'm probably
not gonna fall apart.

02:55.468 --> 03:00.337
...five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

03:00.431 --> 03:05.346
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
Here we go.

Cradle. One...

HOUSE: Put down the pom-poms
and step away
from the computer.

03:10.274 --> 03:13.641
46-year-old
oncologist refuses treatment.

03:13.778 --> 03:15.734
JESSICA: Foreman already
gave us a case.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.152
Wants us to keep
things as normal

03:17.239 --> 03:19.981
as possible for as
long as possible.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.942
Wilson is dying,
Chase is gone,

03:23.037 --> 03:25.153
how close to normal
do you think we can come?

03:25.456 --> 03:27.321
19-year-old cheerleader,
admitted with

03:27.416 --> 03:29.281
massive
nosebleed and dizziness.

03:29.919 --> 03:34.253
Wow, cool,
I just completely forgot
that my best friend is dying.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.793
Wait, thatjust reminded me.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.377
Head CT is clean.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.134
How can we turn Wilson
from a terminal idiot

03:41.222 --> 03:43.713
into an interminable
pain in the ass?

03:43.849 --> 03:46.261
A mini-stroke could
explain our patient's

03:46.352 --> 03:47.762
neuro symptoms and
his butterfingers.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.184
But not his bloody nose.

03:49.313 --> 03:52.305
My best friend is
trying to kill himself.

03:52.650 --> 03:54.515
He just wants to die
with a little dignity.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.191
There's no such thing.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.483
JESSICA: It's not
your choice, House.

04:00.616 --> 04:03.323
Your only choice here
is between
acceptance and misery.

04:07.373 --> 04:10.661
It's a midline granuloma.
Get your patient a PET scan.

04:19.718 --> 04:23.336
No lesions along
the optic track...
You already covered that.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.342
Maybe we should
get someone else
to take this case.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.800
Why? Because someone
somewhere is dying?

04:30.604 --> 04:31.593
(ELECTRONIC BEEP)

04:31.981 --> 04:33.187
Oh, crap! Turn off the mic.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.563
It is off.

04:36.235 --> 04:40.069
Not according to his brain.
His temporal lobe
is completely lit up.

04:40.698 --> 04:44.691
Auditory portion.
He's hearing something.

04:59.884 --> 05:01.249
Foreman's trying to date me.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.553
I assume that's
because you called him.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.510
No, I...

05:06.098 --> 05:09.181
Did you put
something in my coffee?

05:09.268 --> 05:13.602
You know how you
can be there for me
five months from now?

05:13.731 --> 05:15.722
Don't be dead
five months from now.

05:29.622 --> 05:30.657
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

05:30.748 --> 05:31.737
Hey, Wilson...

05:34.543 --> 05:35.658
Seriously?

05:35.794 --> 05:36.954
Just a little picker-downer.

05:37.755 --> 05:40.371
I assume this
unwanted interruption
means you're looking for me

05:40.466 --> 05:41.831
to discuss
the latest development

05:41.926 --> 05:44.008
in a case I don't
want to discuss.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.762
TAUB: Our patient is
hearing voices.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.879
He denies it,
but the PET scan
says otherwise.

05:47.973 --> 05:51.010
He's at the right age
for the onset
of schizophrenia.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.308
Yeah. You really need me.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.894
Ultrasound his abdomen
to check for schizophrenia.

05:55.981 --> 05:59.189
We already ordered
a psych evaluation,
but drugs could also cause...

05:59.276 --> 06:00.982
Tox screen was clean.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.487
Ultrasound his dorm.

Whoa! You guys can'tjust
come busting in here
without a warrant.

06:11.163 --> 06:14.246
We're not cops.
We're your roommate's doctors.

06:17.294 --> 06:22.038
Any idea what flavor of
drugs would be making
your roommate sick?

06:22.132 --> 06:24.123
Objection. Entrapment.

06:29.098 --> 06:30.304
Derrick doesn't party.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.474
JESSICA: Look at this.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.053
Why would he have
a picture of a little boy?

06:37.147 --> 06:38.933
Maybe it's his
nephew or something?

06:39.149 --> 06:40.138
Hidden in his sock drawer?

06:40.859 --> 06:41.894
Whoa!

06:41.986 --> 06:43.317
Creepy.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.156
JESSICA: We need to talk
to Derrick about
some medical matters.

06:54.290 --> 06:55.996
Well, she's my girlfriend.
She can be here for that.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.449
(CLEARS THROAT)

We found this
in your dorm room.

Who is that?

07:07.344 --> 07:08.550
Nobody.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.837
JESSICA: Then why was it
hidden in a drawer?

07:14.351 --> 07:15.636
Derrick, what's
she talking about?

07:19.148 --> 07:20.729
It's my brother,
Christopher.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.850
You never told me
you had a brother.

07:24.987 --> 07:27.353
Well, he's been dead
almost 10 years, so...

07:30.701 --> 07:32.237
Is that the voice
you hear in your head?

07:51.597 --> 07:53.883
So now my hair's
gonna fall out next week?

07:54.850 --> 07:58.058
No, all I did was
temporarily kill you.
How was it?

07:58.729 --> 08:01.687
Look, I wasn't dead.
I was unconscious.

08:01.774 --> 08:05.562
No dreams or thoughts.
You experience nothing.

08:06.528 --> 08:09.565
Now, imagine that
without the waking
up on the couch part.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.402
Just nothing,
times infinity.

08:13.243 --> 08:17.703
You didn'tjust
prove death is nothing.
You proved propofol is.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.578
You're saying the end
is not the end?

08:25.714 --> 08:28.922
I was expecting,
"Nothing is better
than something lousy,"

08:29.051 --> 08:31.292
but not, "The angels
are waiting for me."

08:31.595 --> 08:32.926
I'm not having
this conversation.

08:33.222 --> 08:35.338
Why? Because it
doesn't make sense?

08:35.724 --> 08:38.136
Because I'm not
gonna change your mind,
and I don't care.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.350
More importantly,
you're not gonna change mine.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.689
There is no heaven,
there is no hell,

08:42.773 --> 08:45.310
your soul is not gonna
float out of your body

08:45.442 --> 08:47.979
and join some great,
unifying energy force.

08:48.112 --> 08:49.943
The fact that you're dying
is not gonna change that.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.937
Please, just go.

08:53.617 --> 08:54.982
(SIGHS)

08:58.789 --> 08:59.778
House.

09:01.959 --> 09:07.499
I have spent the last 20 years
holding the hands of
people as they die.

09:07.631 --> 09:10.122
When I watch that
transformation...

09:12.636 --> 09:17.596
I'm sorry, I don't believe
that we're just
a bag of chemicals.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.303
(DOOR CLOSES)

09:30.988 --> 09:34.776
So are we gonna
talk about the patient,
or wait for House?

09:35.492 --> 09:36.607
Viral encephalitis.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.317
It's been going
on for 10 years.

09:39.830 --> 09:42.788
I'm gonna go in there
and invite him to participate.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.165
I think he'd
welcome the distraction.

09:47.755 --> 09:48.744
Come with me?

09:53.385 --> 09:54.374
VVhy?

09:55.429 --> 09:58.091
When was the last time
House listened to
anything we said

09:58.182 --> 09:59.342
about anything personal?

10:00.184 --> 10:03.802
Maybe you'll feel better,
but sometimes, the truth is,

10:04.521 --> 10:07.103
there's nothing anyone can do.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.693
Temporal lobe epilepsy.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.362
Causes voices, dizziness.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.690
Trauma from a seizure
would explain the nose bleed.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.159
You know about
all of my siblings,

10:21.288 --> 10:23.119
and cousins,
and aunts and uncles, and...

10:23.207 --> 10:24.287
You're overreacting.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.535
Because you
don't trust me enough
to tell me about...

10:26.668 --> 10:29.796
Sorry. It's time to
go down for your test.

10:31.507 --> 10:34.169
If you want to wait here,
it'll only take about an hour.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.669
No, she's leaving.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.258
Derrick, come on. I mean,
we should at least talk.

10:40.516 --> 10:42.507
No, I'd rather
you just leave.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.225
And you don't need
to come back.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.195
Time. Any odd
tastes or smells?

11:00.911 --> 11:02.276
No. Feel fine.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.908
Things looked
fine on my end, too.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.415
So you won't
admit to your doctors

11:12.506 --> 11:14.713
that you're hearing
your brother's voice,

11:14.800 --> 11:16.586
which is dangerous.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.255
And now, you lost
your girlfriend over it.

11:19.930 --> 11:20.885
Which is stupid.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.713
I assume there's
more to the story?

11:23.475 --> 11:24.806
That's how I was raised.

11:26.562 --> 11:27.597
Short story.
Yeah.

11:29.106 --> 11:31.222
My boss is losing his
best friend to cancer.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.141
And instead of
talking about the pain,

11:34.278 --> 11:36.519
he's pretending
there is no pain,

11:36.613 --> 11:38.478
because
everything can be fixed.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.122
My father tried
to deal with it.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.494
Ironic that he'd drink
himself into oblivion

11:49.585 --> 11:51.951
after my brother was
killed by a drunk driver.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.340
Do you need a tissue?

12:02.472 --> 12:06.886
After Dad left,
my mom moved us away.

12:06.977 --> 12:10.936
She got rid of all
the pictures of Christopher
and never mentioned him again.

12:11.315 --> 12:12.350
It was like he never existed.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.064
And that worked for us.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.767
And, yet, you kept one.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.858
Uh... My right eye...

12:21.450 --> 12:24.658
I was seeing spots,
but now I can't see at all.
Is that from the test?

12:25.871 --> 12:27.156
No, this is something else.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.256
Is that bad?

12:40.344 --> 12:43.177
Don't know.
Because I don't
know why it happened.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.676
Hey.

12:52.481 --> 12:53.516
Saved us a table.

12:53.649 --> 12:54.638
There are notables.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.816
I recently hacked
into your old files.

12:57.903 --> 13:01.111
Found a 6-year-old boy
with bilateral retinoblastoma.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.654
Doctors wanted to
take his eyes out

13:02.783 --> 13:04.193
before the cancer
spread to his brain.

13:04.326 --> 13:09.946
But you fought them.
Advocated for a new
photon beam radiation.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.406
Saved the kid's vision,
probably saved his life.

13:12.876 --> 13:16.494
That was my
first case at PPTH.
Mikey Kimble.

13:16.588 --> 13:17.748
It's Michael, now.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.916

Graduating next month.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.644
Already? Little Mikey?

13:38.443 --> 13:40.695
And I got
accepted to Princeton.

13:40.821 --> 13:43.062
I'm planning on
going to med school.

13:43.407 --> 13:44.396

13:44.992 --> 13:47.904
He's going to be a doctor.
Instead of being dead.

13:50.414 --> 13:54.908
Dr. House told me all
about your situation.

13:55.127 --> 13:56.867
That's why I came.

13:56.962 --> 13:59.078
There's just so much
good that you can do,

13:59.214 --> 14:01.330
even in a small
amount of time.

14:05.137 --> 14:06.422
I wonder...

14:08.765 --> 14:09.754
Hey!

14:09.933 --> 14:14.267
Is there anybody else
here who's alive today
because of Dr. James Wilson?

14:34.291 --> 14:39.035
Gastric adenocarcinoma.
Fifteen years in remission.

14:39.296 --> 14:42.880
Six grandchildren
that I never would have met.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.543
Thank you, Dr. Wilson.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.796
Squamous cell lung cancer.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.049
Twelve years in remission.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.472
I was able to walk my daughter
down the aisle last May.

14:53.852 --> 14:54.841
Thank you, Dr. Wilson.

15:05.781 --> 15:06.770
HOUSE: I did the math.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.941

15:18.043 --> 15:21.456
Mikey Kimble
started kindergarten
before the age cut-off.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.131
He would have graduated
high school last year.

15:29.471 --> 15:30.460
I flunked a year?

15:32.724 --> 15:35.215
Was anybody in this room
really a patient of mine?

15:42.442 --> 15:43.431
They're somewhere.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.934
They're giving you
a standing "0" somewhere.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.313
They exist.
You saved their lives.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.818
It's actually more impressive
that they're too
busy to be here.

15:59.668 --> 16:00.657
What's this?

16:00.752 --> 16:02.162
A glowing letter
of recommendation

16:02.254 --> 16:04.336
you just wrote
for me on my laptop.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.708
I noticed it's lacking
your signature at the bottom.

16:06.842 --> 16:09.834
Don't you think you're
being a bit premature
predicting House's demise?

16:09.928 --> 16:12.010
Not demise, just implosion.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.929

through a rough time.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.889

16:32.200 --> 16:33.656
Your shoes are wet.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.449
Glad to see your
emotional turmoil

16:35.537 --> 16:37.903

I know you're responsible.

16:40.375 --> 16:44.960
No, you don't.
Because I didn't do it.
Whatever "it" is.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.538
But if I had shoved
those season tickets
down some toilets,

16:48.633 --> 16:50.589
I would have done it
because you asked me to.

16:51.803 --> 16:55.091
You wanted to replace Wilson.
I prank Wilson all the time.

I made the list.

17:51.655 --> 17:52.644
Hmm...

17:53.573 --> 17:56.064

stop being surreal?

17:58.787 --> 18:04.373

One of my patients
suddenly started crying.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.341
It can't be your first.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.881
It was the first one
who was crying for me.

18:21.893 --> 18:25.636
It's the human response.
It's either overly saccharine,

18:25.730 --> 18:27.891
because giving sympathy
makes them feel better,

18:28.108 --> 18:29.439
or they ignore you,

18:29.526 --> 18:32.484
because hiding from mortality
makes them feel better.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.904
Well, why can't
they just say something
that makes me feel better?

18:36.866 --> 18:38.197

No.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.115
Mmm...

18:50.130 --> 18:52.496

Two weeks on, two weeks off?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.544
So maybe do your first round,
see how it goes.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.460
May be not as
horrible as you fear.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.887
Then do the second round,
enjoy your two weeks off,

19:00.974 --> 19:04.717
and revisit the decision.
Rinse, repeat.

19:09.274 --> 19:12.641
I just can't envision
spending my remaining time

19:12.736 --> 19:14.943
in a chemo suite
in Princeton.

19:19.284 --> 19:23.698
I want to enjoy myself
with family and friends.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.410
Friends, or friend?

19:31.129 --> 19:33.871
Hi, this is Greg House again.
Third message.

19:33.965 --> 19:37.207
Hopefully indicating
how much I want
you to call me back.

19:37.302 --> 19:40.294
I'd say that your son is dying
to increase the urgency,

19:40.388 --> 19:42.219
but you probably
already know that.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.634
The fake people who care
that Wilson stays
alive didn't work,

19:46.728 --> 19:48.639
so I need the real people
who care about him

19:48.730 --> 19:50.311
to tell him what
an idiot he's being.

19:50.607 --> 19:51.687
Where are we going?

19:51.858 --> 19:53.394
Well, ljust got paged
to go to the bathroom.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.062
I don't know where
the rest of you are going.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.194
Some of our
patient's symptoms
might be physiological

20:00.116 --> 20:01.947
You think being forced
to bury painful memories

20:02.035 --> 20:03.150
is making his symptoms worse?

20:03.244 --> 20:06.077
Grief avoidance can lead
to all sorts of
anxiety disorders,

20:06.164 --> 20:09.998
which can manifest
into physical illness.

20:10.877 --> 20:14.916
Let's assume that
all his symptoms
are real symptoms.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.506
So we're going to
avoid grief avoidance?

20:18.635 --> 20:20.296
Studies after
September 11th showed that

20:20.428 --> 20:22.134
repression was
actually better for coping

20:22.222 --> 20:23.428
than dwelling in misery.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.050
What about polycythemia vera?

20:25.141 --> 20:27.257
JESSICA: RBC's are slightly
elevated, but not that much.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.804
Hodgkin's lymphoma?

20:28.937 --> 20:30.302
Would have shown
up on the PET scan.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.762
What if our guy
got hurt at practice

20:33.316 --> 20:35.648
and, like everything else,
just didn't tell anyone?

20:35.985 --> 20:37.896
Could have set off DIC.
Would explain everything.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.489
I thought you had to
go to the bathroom.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.155
I didn't say I had to go in.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.150
Need some more mops in here!

20:50.500 --> 20:52.411
What exactly are
you looking for?

20:52.919 --> 20:56.411
Blood. If your
spinal fluid is yellow
instead of clear,

20:56.506 --> 20:58.246
it means you've had
a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.968
What does your
brother say to you?

21:04.180 --> 21:06.762
Does he tell you
you're gonna be okay?

21:08.143 --> 21:10.179
ItdoesnT
really work like that.

21:11.438 --> 21:14.350
I think you hear
your brother's voice
for a reason.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.098
I thought you guys
said that I hear things
because I'm sick.

21:17.193 --> 21:20.105
Yes, but that doesn't explain
why you don't hear
a different voice.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.563
I think your mom
didn't let you deal

21:22.699 --> 21:24.860
with the grief of
losing your brother properly.

21:26.369 --> 21:29.202
There are people here
who could help you with that.

21:33.877 --> 21:34.866
Okay.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.670
The opening
pressure's way too high.

22:07.702 --> 22:09.863

my offer to off you?

22:10.079 --> 22:12.331
I think I've still got
some leftover propofol.

22:12.499 --> 22:13.909
I spoke to Wilson.

22:15.543 --> 22:19.912
He's angry because I
want him to live longer.

And you may have
rationalized it
100 different ways,

22:36.356 --> 22:38.438
but the fact is
you fired me so that

22:38.608 --> 22:40.690
I'd be forced to
spend the rest of my life

22:40.777 --> 22:43.268
doing exactly
what I wanted to do.

letting my parents

start taking effect.

I'm not sure what
Derrick's told you,

24:40.521 --> 24:43.888
but he's been
hearing Christopher's voice
for the last 10 years.

24:44.275 --> 24:48.109
And it's possible that
repressing all
that grief he's felt

24:48.196 --> 24:50.858
is actually causing some of
Derrick's symptoms.

24:54.202 --> 24:57.319
I don't even know if
this voice in my head
is something I invented,

24:57.413 --> 24:59.369

Christopher was really like.

about our friendship

it was real emotion,

31:23.716 --> 31:27.459
We got a case.
I assume the status is
patient's getting worse,

31:27.553 --> 31:28.963
you guys are confused.

31:29.722 --> 31:31.929
You think actually
showing up for work

31:32.058 --> 31:34.265
is enough to make up
for ruining an MRI?

31:34.393 --> 31:36.805
Endangering the patient,
injuring us?

31:36.896 --> 31:38.978
I've got an airtight
alibi that I'm working on.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.475
This isn't about the damage.
You're back

31:40.608 --> 31:42.018
because something's
going on with Wilson.

31:42.193 --> 31:43.433
I'm done with Wilson.

31:43.694 --> 31:45.309
What does that mean,
you're done with Wilson?

31:45.404 --> 31:47.520
If he's not dead,
you're not done with Wilson.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.151
Suddenly, you think
you're gonna
make a difference?

31:49.575 --> 31:50.815
You can'tjust abandon him.

31:50.993 --> 31:53.029
It's in his hands now.
Did you get

31:53.162 --> 31:55.198
any good pictures
before the MRI drowned?

31:55.331 --> 31:57.572
Enough to know it
wasn't a migraine.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.949
And the patient
mistook me for Adams.

32:09.553 --> 32:10.804
Come with me.

32:15.142 --> 32:17.303
Hey.

32:17.394 --> 32:18.520
So what do you
think's gonna happen

32:18.604 --> 32:20.265
when I stick
a needle into his eardrum?

32:20.356 --> 32:21.562
You quizzing us?

32:21.649 --> 32:23.014
This is a good quiz.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.557
He'll scream in pain.

32:24.652 --> 32:25.687
HOUSE: Don't listen to her.

32:25.778 --> 32:27.518
Very small needle,
very steady hands.

32:29.198 --> 32:30.529
Now, when I pull
back on the plunger,

32:30.658 --> 32:31.989
what do you think
is gonna come out?

32:32.159 --> 32:33.148
Air.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.286
Boy, that air sure is red.

32:42.336 --> 32:44.327
Persistent Stapedial Artery.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.503
It should disappear
in the embryonic stage.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.544
But just like
his dead brother,
he really can't let go.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.422
So the artery's been pressing
against the temporal
lobe of his brain,

32:52.513 --> 32:53.548
right above the ear canal.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.800
Explains the voices,
the dizziness, everything.

32:57.017 --> 32:59.053
Now you guys can explain
how we're gonna
make him better.

33:05.609 --> 33:07.145
Will my brother's
voice go away?

33:14.660 --> 33:15.945
You're being an ass.

33:16.871 --> 33:18.827
ljust cured a patient.
How about you?

33:18.914 --> 33:20.324
You can'tjust
give up on Wilson.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.076
You know he needs you.

33:22.376 --> 33:23.741
You know he's making
an impossible choice.

33:23.878 --> 33:25.243
He just doesn't
want to live in pain.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.005
Life is pain.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.672
Iwake up every
morning and I'm in pain.
I go to work in pain.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.590
You know how many times
I've wanted to just give up?

33:33.137 --> 33:34.752
How many times
I've thought about ending it?

33:56.285 --> 33:57.274
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

34:01.373 --> 34:04.160
You here to yell at me,
or give me hockey tickets?

34:04.251 --> 34:05.866
Had to delay the surgery
because our patient

34:06.003 --> 34:07.664
drank ammonia from
the janitor's cart.

34:09.048 --> 34:12.211
I guess he didn't want to live
without his brother's voice.

34:18.015 --> 34:19.346
Where are you going?

34:26.690 --> 34:28.396
You can't wait to die?

34:29.276 --> 34:30.265
Here, let me help you.

34:30.361 --> 34:31.851
Hey!Hey!

34:31.987 --> 34:32.976
House!

34:33.530 --> 34:35.031
See? You wanna live.

34:35.157 --> 34:37.068
He did something stupid.
He's not gonna do it again.

34:37.159 --> 34:40.947
You're resisting me
because it's our human
responsibility to stay alive!

34:41.038 --> 34:43.575
You've made your point, House!
Stop!

34:50.798 --> 34:51.787
(GASPING)

34:56.345 --> 34:59.212
You've spent your whole life
looking for the truth.

34:59.306 --> 35:02.093
Well, sometimes,
the truth just sucks.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.429
Um, um...

35:11.694 --> 35:16.609
I'm going to be leaving, uh...
Quite a bit earlier
than we had talked about.

35:19.410 --> 35:20.775
Next day or two.

35:22.538 --> 35:24.745
What happened?

35:24.832 --> 35:26.413
Something
between you and House?

35:30.296 --> 35:31.456
He's not my child.

35:33.173 --> 35:37.837
I cannot be responsible
for the happiness
of Gregory House.

35:40.681 --> 35:42.797
(STAMMERING) I'll give
these to Frankel.

35:43.142 --> 35:44.131
Okay, thank you.

35:46.937 --> 35:49.519
And you are responsible.

35:53.193 --> 35:57.812
The past 20 years,
you've had three wives,

35:58.907 --> 36:01.740
hundreds of colleagues,
thousands of patients.

36:03.579 --> 36:05.490
But you've kept
that one best friend.

36:07.708 --> 36:12.042
He wants me to suffer
a misery that I don't
want to go through.

36:16.592 --> 36:18.674
Chemo won't make
your life any better.

36:19.762 --> 36:20.968
But caring will.

36:22.056 --> 36:25.344
Enduring pain to do some good
for someone you care about.

Mom.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.003
Yeah?

37:48.016 --> 37:50.598
That picture of Christopher
that I had on the stand,

37:52.729 --> 37:53.809
did you take it?

37:56.608 --> 37:57.597
Yes.

37:59.027 --> 38:00.312
Did you throw it out?

38:05.117 --> 38:06.948
If I agree to
get this surgery,

38:07.077 --> 38:08.908
can you bring
that picture back?

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

WILSON: House.

38:51.955 --> 38:53.946
I'm ready to start
the next round of chemo.

38:56.293 --> 38:57.328
VVhy?

38:58.670 --> 39:00.046
Because you need me.

39:00.756 --> 39:05.090
And I don't think
that's a bad thing anymore.

39:08.555 --> 39:09.544
No.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.762
You're the only
one I listen to.

39:14.853 --> 39:18.016
And the last couple
of days, I didn't.
I almost killed my patient.

39:18.732 --> 39:20.643
So I think it's
time for me to accept

39:20.734 --> 39:25.444
that you're just
smarter than I am.

39:29.451 --> 39:32.238
Are you really okay that
there's only five months left?

39:34.122 --> 39:35.111
No.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.702
But it's better than nothing.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.037
Um...

39:45.634 --> 39:46.749
How do we start?

The surgery worked.

40:21.920 --> 40:22.909
How can you tell?

40:24.464 --> 40:25.920
Because Christopher's gone.

41:31.615 --> 41:34.357
And this is the peak.
Almost 8,000 feet.

41:35.077 --> 41:39.286
You do realize
that my leg situation
has deteriorated a little

41:39.373 --> 41:40.829

time we went hiking.

The plumber
retrieved them from
the hospital outflow pipe.

They caused the sewage back up
that ruined the MRI.

your name on them.
