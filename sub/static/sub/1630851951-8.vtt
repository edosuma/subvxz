00:04.338 --> 00:05.772
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

00:05.873 --> 00:08.876
- Huh, Mr. Brown [chuckles],
did you lose a contact?

00:08.976 --> 00:10.611
- No, I wish I would have,

00:10.711 --> 00:13.447
I would only have to look at
half of Vinny's ol' fat head.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.783
- No, I got a crook in my neck.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.385
- Oh, a crook?
- Yeah.

00:18.485 --> 00:21.955
- I know the crook,
it is called old age, huh?

00:22.055 --> 00:24.391
It robs us of our youth slowly.

00:24.491 --> 00:26.059
- Ain't nothing robbing me
of my youth,

00:26.159 --> 00:27.427
I'm still young at heart.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.063

can make you breathe,

00:30.163 --> 00:32.132
but it cannot help
your stiff bones.

I still can--

Look, I got moves,

- No, don't no--

00:45.012 --> 00:46.780
I don't want yo'
greasy hands all over me.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.148

00:55.522 --> 00:57.457

- Okay.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.193

I'll be back to normal.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.694

01:02.062 --> 01:03.096

01:04.565 --> 01:09.837

Samples of what?

01:11.471 --> 01:13.941

is going to change my life,

01:14.074 --> 01:15.442

Look, my eyes done got so bad,

01:30.390 --> 01:32.392
I was coming down
the hall the other day,

01:32.492 --> 01:35.229
and I thought I was being
chased by a giant Milk Dud

01:35.329 --> 01:37.631
'til I realized,
it was just my shadow.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.766
- [chuckles]
You think that's something,

01:39.867 --> 01:42.870
the other day, I mistook my hand
for a sock puppet.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.306
- Okay, wh--what is it?

01:46.406 --> 01:49.943

but I could use a little energy.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.520

new business venture.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.189
I heard about it from a friend,
who has since passed away.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.325

02:05.425 --> 02:06.527
You--okay, wait a minute,

told you about it

02:08.195 --> 02:10.564
that has since passed away.
- Uh-huh.

02:10.664 --> 02:13.166
- How many sips did he take
before he passed away?

02:14.501 --> 02:17.404
- No [chuckles],
he was hit by a truck

02:17.504 --> 02:19.840
on the same day
that he took the product.

02:19.940 --> 02:20.908
But that's
just a coincidence.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.142
Go, go, try it, have a sip.

02:22.242 --> 02:23.911

I said, "What you got on?"

08:09.983 --> 08:11.485
Girl, somebody gon' mistake you

08:11.585 --> 08:14.488

or something.

08:14.588 --> 08:17.658
- For your information,
I'm going to the mall.

08:17.758 --> 08:20.961
- To do what, ring a bell
and take up donations?

08:21.061 --> 08:23.597
- To hang.
- You going to hang?

08:23.697 --> 08:27.334
What you hanging,
clothes or old dead skin?

08:27.434 --> 08:29.703
- SANDRA:
Ready, Ms. Anastasia?

08:29.803 --> 08:32.973
- Let's roll, Shawty.

08:33.073 --> 08:35.042
- Nah, that's what
your dress is...shawty.

08:38.512 --> 08:39.880
What done got into her?

08:39.980 --> 08:41.348
- I don't know
but she's treating,

08:41.448 --> 08:43.550
so if she wants to go to
the mall looking like a THOT,

08:43.650 --> 08:47.120
that' fine with me.

08:47.187 --> 08:49.323
- ♪

08:49.423 --> 08:51.658
- Look behind you!
- Run!

08:51.758 --> 08:53.327
- Come on, run, Black man,
run, run, run!

08:53.427 --> 08:54.728
- Oh, oh, oh!

08:54.828 --> 08:56.663
- LEAH: He 'bout to die,
he gon' get him, look at him.

08:56.763 --> 08:58.432
- Hey, Mom, hey, Ms. Cora.
- Oh, hey.

08:58.532 --> 09:00.934
- Hey, baby girl.
- Who's your new friend?

09:01.034 --> 09:03.136
- Go, don't let him
do that to you.

09:03.203 --> 09:06.373
Ms. Ana--Ms. Anastasia?

09:06.473 --> 09:08.041
- Funk fresh in the flesh.

09:08.141 --> 09:09.576
- [laughing]

09:09.676 --> 09:11.511
So, have you did
a stand-up comedy act

09:11.612 --> 09:13.380
that you haven't told us about?

09:13.480 --> 09:16.483
- No, this is just a side of me
that you've never seen before.

09:16.583 --> 09:18.752
- Oh!
- Her ratchet side.

09:18.852 --> 09:20.721
Cora, something's up.

09:20.821 --> 09:24.224
- Yeah, she done aged out
of her mid-life crisis.

09:24.324 --> 09:25.425
- You know, she kept saying,

09:25.525 --> 09:26.793
she was gonna
join the Cougar Club,

09:26.893 --> 09:28.228
so she can land
her seventh husband.

09:28.328 --> 09:30.264
And she kept saying that 80
was the new 30,

09:30.364 --> 09:31.632
so if that's the case,

09:31.732 --> 09:35.168
then I'm about 20 years
from conception, so I'ma go.

09:36.470 --> 09:37.638
- [laughing]

09:37.738 --> 09:39.539
- Oh, I'ma get her, oh!

09:39.640 --> 09:41.842
One of these days,
I'ma get her.

09:41.942 --> 09:46.013
Hey, baby--oh,
that's for me, thank you.

09:46.179 --> 09:47.481
- Nooo!

09:47.581 --> 09:48.715
- [laughing]

09:48.815 --> 09:50.751
- This is not for you,
this is for Anastasia.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.886
Apparently, she has
a birthday coming up.

09:52.986 --> 09:54.121
- Oh.

09:54.221 --> 09:55.856
- That must be why
she dressing all hoochiefied,

09:55.956 --> 09:57.424
trying to get her groove back.

09:57.524 --> 09:58.692
- CORA: [laughing]

09:58.792 --> 10:00.127
Oh, I need to go
pick some things up

10:00.227 --> 10:01.628
so we can have her
a birthday party.

10:01.728 --> 10:02.896
- Good idea.

10:02.996 --> 10:04.531
- Okay, okay,
I'm gon' put my shoes on.

10:04.631 --> 10:05.766
- Great idea.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.134
- Hey, y'all need
anything from the store?

10:07.200 --> 10:09.169
- Oh, I want some Colas Zeros.
- CORA: Okay.

10:09.269 --> 10:10.704
- Thank you.
- Alright.

10:10.804 --> 10:12.005
Anybody else need anything?

10:12.139 --> 10:14.675
- I need a laxative,
something strong, real strong.

10:14.775 --> 10:16.510
- CORA: Extra strength.

10:16.610 --> 10:18.912
- Oh, oh, wait a minute,
you can't eat these,

10:19.012 --> 10:20.747
they'll inflate your tire,

10:20.847 --> 10:23.417
that middle that Jeremy's
always talking about.

10:23.517 --> 10:25.152
- What?
I did not say that.

10:25.218 --> 10:26.887
- VINNY: You did say that,
you a liar.

10:26.987 --> 10:29.156
Look, when we was down
at the Drink 'Til You Drop Bar,

10:29.222 --> 10:30.691
you was all up
in that girl face--

10:30.791 --> 10:31.892
- What?
- Oh!

10:31.992 --> 10:33.160
- VINNY: That white girl.
- Boy!

10:33.226 --> 10:34.861
- That white girl,
you was all over her, man.

10:34.962 --> 10:36.029
- JEREMY: You wildin', man.
- You said-

10:36.163 --> 10:37.531
- JEREMY: I did not say--
no, no.

10:37.631 --> 10:39.032
- You don't--
you don't need these.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.534
- JEREMY: Baby,
I did not say that.

10:40.634 --> 10:41.969
- LEAH: Huh?
- No, what I said was

10:42.069 --> 10:43.870
that we need to get
the tires changed on the car,

10:43.971 --> 10:45.372
not your tire.
- So, I got tires?

10:45.472 --> 10:47.441
- [scoffs] No, like a ten-speed,
not like a car tire.

10:47.541 --> 10:48.508
- Like a--
- What?

10:48.609 --> 10:49.810
- Boy!
- Why are you hitting me?

10:49.910 --> 10:51.478
- I--why you think
I'm hitting you, and what girl?

10:51.578 --> 10:52.713
What one of you out there was
talking to that girl?

10:54.897 --> 10:56.132
- MR. BROWN:
Y'all better hurry up,

10:56.232 --> 10:57.734
y'all better hurry up!
Let's go, hurry up!

10:57.834 --> 10:59.269
Them people crazy.

11:01.137 --> 11:03.139
- Man, this Black Don't Crack
is making people mad.

11:05.275 --> 11:07.777
- That's okay, just so they
keep the money coming.

11:07.877 --> 11:09.445
- LINDOR: No, I mean,
like, really mad.

11:09.545 --> 11:10.546
This man told this lady,

11:10.647 --> 11:11.848
instead of trying
to be a supermodel,

11:11.948 --> 11:13.916
she should be a sumo wrestler.

11:14.017 --> 11:15.652
She took a sip of
Black Don't Crack

11:15.752 --> 11:18.554
and body-slammed him.
He had to tap out.

11:18.655 --> 11:20.256
- That ain't--that ain't
my business,

11:20.356 --> 11:22.492
just so they keep lining
our pockets, I don't care.

11:22.592 --> 11:23.793
- Yes, indeed, brother.

11:23.893 --> 11:26.229
Look, Lindor,
open that window,

11:26.329 --> 11:27.630
and sell it from there.

11:27.730 --> 11:28.932
- Like a concession stand?

11:29.032 --> 11:30.566
- Yes, 'cuz they're
bringing in the big bucks.

11:30.667 --> 11:33.403
Look, look, look, we'll give you
an extra 2% for your troubles.

11:33.503 --> 11:36.105
- Cool, and a lifetime supply
of Black Don't Crack.

11:36.205 --> 11:38.474
- Nah, how about a lifetime
supply of don't be greedy.

11:38.574 --> 11:39.876
Don't--don't do that.

11:39.976 --> 11:41.844
If somebody taking care of you,
you take care of them.

11:41.945 --> 11:44.147
- And--and you don't want
to get high off your own supply.

11:45.615 --> 11:46.950
- Go on,
go on and get the stuff.

11:47.050 --> 11:49.218
Yeah, get two people
to share one bottle.

11:49.319 --> 11:51.054
And we--
it's half off.

11:53.022 --> 11:55.692
- Well, you so old,

11:55.825 --> 11:58.261
that I looked up "ancient"
in the dictionary,

11:58.361 --> 11:59.829
and saw your mug shot.

11:59.862 --> 12:02.098
- [chuckles] That's a good one,
very good one.

12:02.198 --> 12:06.135
You so old that you
poop fossils rock.

12:06.235 --> 12:10.239
- Well, you're so old that your
Social Security number is one.

12:10.340 --> 12:12.041
- Oh, that's a
very good one, too.

12:12.141 --> 12:14.277
Well, you know what,
I heard through the grapevine

12:14.377 --> 12:17.880
that your ex-wife left
you for a bullrider

12:17.981 --> 12:19.282
because she wanted to
experience

12:19.382 --> 12:22.318
what it'll be like
to ride, Missionary Man.

12:22.418 --> 12:24.887
- Okay, Nutless Professor.
- Anytime, bring it on.

12:24.988 --> 12:26.522
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ding, ding, ding!

12:26.623 --> 12:27.857
- Ding, ding, nothing.

12:27.924 --> 12:29.759
- Go to the corner,
what are y'all doing?

12:29.859 --> 12:31.194
- I'll fight
a light-skinned dude,

12:31.294 --> 12:32.295
I don't care, man.

12:32.395 --> 12:34.364
- You can't fight him,
he makes us money.

12:34.464 --> 12:37.667
What are y'all--
what is going on around here?

12:37.767 --> 12:39.569
- JEREMY:
Man, you not gon' believe

12:39.669 --> 12:41.237
what just happened to me.
- Oh, what?

12:41.337 --> 12:43.306
- Man, my old boss
just called me,

12:43.406 --> 12:46.542
offering me a remote position,
paying more money.

12:46.643 --> 12:47.777
- Shut up, you took it?

12:47.877 --> 12:49.379
- Nah, nah,
I told him to shove it.

12:49.479 --> 12:50.780
Yeah, and I told him

12:50.880 --> 12:52.882
that I don't like
his concave forehead

12:52.915 --> 12:54.851
and his platypus nose.

12:54.951 --> 12:57.320
And I told him his wife looks
like a cabbage patch.

12:57.420 --> 12:59.389
- That's terrible!
- Eh, whatever, Fatback.

13:01.858 --> 13:04.093
- What--what is happening
around here?

13:04.193 --> 13:06.262
Is--is diarrhea of the mouth
going around in here?

13:06.362 --> 13:08.164
- I think that it is.

13:08.264 --> 13:10.433
- What is this?

13:10.533 --> 13:13.202
Okay.

13:13.303 --> 13:17.507
Dear Mr. Brown
and Mr. O-wem-a-way...

13:17.607 --> 13:19.108
O-wem-a-way...
- Omowale!

13:19.208 --> 13:21.344
- Omowale, alright, okay, okay.

13:21.444 --> 13:23.279
"I am writing to address
the false claims

13:23.379 --> 13:25.415
"of your product,

"So cease and desist

or yo' fatheads will be slapped

13:42.165 --> 13:43.866
- It sounds like
whoever wrote the letter,

13:43.967 --> 13:46.736
drank some of it, too.

13:46.869 --> 13:52.075
- Man, say
a class-action lawsuit?

13:52.175 --> 13:55.211
Wh--we got to go
to class for the lawsuit?

13:57.213 --> 13:58.548

14:01.818 --> 14:03.620
- Okay.

14:03.720 --> 14:04.821
- We did good, Cora.
- We did.

14:04.854 --> 14:05.955
- We did good.

14:06.055 --> 14:07.924
- Ms. Anastasia's
gonna be so surprised.

14:08.024 --> 14:09.926
- Oh, I bet she thinks
we forgot all about her.

14:10.026 --> 14:11.995
- Yep, I bet she do,
I bet she does.

14:12.095 --> 14:15.064
Oh, put this away.
- Yeah, let's grab this.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.869
- CORA: Okay.
- Okay, I will get the candles.

14:19.969 --> 14:21.237
- CORA: Okay.
- And an extinguisher,

14:21.337 --> 14:22.905
I mean, there'll be
so many of them,

14:23.006 --> 14:23.873
it might light
a fire [chuckles].

14:23.973 --> 14:25.842
- Girl!

14:25.875 --> 14:26.843
[chuckles] Well that
looks nice, okay, so--

14:26.876 --> 14:28.311
- That does look really nice.

14:28.411 --> 14:30.213
- So, I'ma put something else
in here once we get everything--

14:30.313 --> 14:31.514
- [doorbell rings]
- CORA: --settled.

14:31.614 --> 14:33.616
- Okay, and we could put a
little tablecloth down.

14:33.716 --> 14:34.884
- CORA: Yeah, a tablecloth.

14:34.984 --> 14:36.452
We do need to put
something on the table.

14:36.552 --> 14:38.121
- [sighs] What should
I do with this stuff?

14:38.221 --> 14:39.722
- Oh, sit it right here
on the table.

14:39.856 --> 14:41.057
Right here next to the cake.
- Cool.

14:41.157 --> 14:42.225
- What else did you get?

14:42.325 --> 14:43.726
- I got everything that was
on the list.

14:43.860 --> 14:44.961
- Okay, great.
- Oh! Did you get

14:45.061 --> 14:46.329
that tummy tuck apparatus?
- Yep.

14:46.429 --> 14:48.865
- Good, you got the,
uh, facial hair cream remover?

14:48.898 --> 14:51.167
- Oh, yeah, B-O-G-O.
- [laughs]

14:51.267 --> 14:54.037
- You know how I do.
- Good job, baby [laughing].

14:54.137 --> 14:56.139
- CORA: [laughing]

14:56.239 --> 15:00.276
Oh, hey, Ms. Anastasia, girl,
how you doing today?

15:00.376 --> 15:01.577
You doing okay?

15:01.678 --> 15:03.579
- Hey, I've seen better days.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.315
- Yeah, I'm sure you have.

15:07.350 --> 15:08.551
- [laughing]

15:08.651 --> 15:09.886
- Uh, everything okay?

15:09.986 --> 15:12.956
- I suppose, just another day
in the life of boredom.

15:13.056 --> 15:14.290
- Yeah.
- Well, Ms. Anastasia,

15:14.390 --> 15:16.893
what happened to you
joining the Cougar Club,

15:16.993 --> 15:19.362
and, uh, your hot mini skirt?

15:19.462 --> 15:22.098
- CORA: Right, I mean, you was
so excited earlier,

15:22.198 --> 15:23.666
and full of energy.
- Mm-hm.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.001
- Who was I fooling?

15:25.101 --> 15:27.103
The only young men
that want to be with me

15:27.203 --> 15:32.308
would have to be deaf and blind,
and tryna sow his wild oats.

15:32.408 --> 15:34.911
- That is not true.
- Mm-mm.

15:35.011 --> 15:38.414
- What's wrong with her,
why does she think that?

15:38.514 --> 15:42.285
- Are you saying
that if you were single,

15:42.385 --> 15:44.954
you would look my way twice?

15:45.054 --> 15:47.690
- I mean, yeah, if you were,
like, in the crosswalk

15:47.857 --> 15:49.359
and I was driving.

15:49.459 --> 15:52.362
If, uh, you needed help
with your grocery bags,

15:52.462 --> 15:54.163
or if you had fallen
and can't get up.

15:54.264 --> 15:56.399
- See, I'm an old geezer.

15:56.499 --> 15:58.568
- [chuckles] I mean,
what would you rather be,

15:58.668 --> 16:00.670
a geezer or a skeezer?

16:04.641 --> 16:07.310
- Ms. Anastasia,
I'm sure your day will brighten.

16:07.410 --> 16:10.947
- The only thing bright
about my day is this shirt.

16:11.047 --> 16:12.815
- UNISON: [reading]
"Getting old sucks."

16:12.849 --> 16:14.050
- That's not true.

16:14.150 --> 16:15.918
- No, getting older
comes with wisdom,

16:16.019 --> 16:17.520
and--and experience.

16:17.620 --> 16:22.659
- Yes, and new teeth,
and gadgets like hearing aids,

16:22.825 --> 16:25.061
uh, Botox, The Clapper.

16:25.161 --> 16:28.264
- And wrinkles, and memory loss,

16:28.364 --> 16:31.100
and body parts
that don't work anymore.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.468
- Well, I mean, you just need

16:32.568 --> 16:34.270
to have a celebration,
Ms. Anastasia.

16:34.370 --> 16:36.506
- Yeah, just a little lift.

16:36.606 --> 16:40.410
- Which part, my sagging cheeks
or dimpled butt?

16:40.510 --> 16:43.546
- Oh no, you're beautiful,
Ms. Anastasia.

16:43.646 --> 16:44.747
- Mm-hm.

16:44.847 --> 16:46.349
- You--you know, you just need
to have some fun,

16:46.449 --> 16:48.851
you know, something exciting.
Have a fuss.

16:48.885 --> 16:50.853
- Yes, you're right.
- Yes.

16:50.954 --> 16:55.058
- I think I'll watch some reruns
of "The Price Ain't Right,"

16:55.158 --> 16:57.427
and eat me some dried prunes.

16:58.661 --> 17:00.096
- Oh!

17:00.196 --> 17:01.798
- You know, we--we--
we were thinking

17:01.831 --> 17:03.266
about something a lot more fun.

17:03.366 --> 17:05.835
- Yeah.
Fun [giggling].

17:05.935 --> 17:07.804
- You know, I just don't get it.

17:07.870 --> 17:10.440
I don't understand
why people my age

17:10.540 --> 17:13.443
would even ever wanna
celebrate a birthday.

17:13.543 --> 17:16.412
I absolutely hate them,
I just detest them.

17:16.512 --> 17:17.814
- CORA: You do?
You hate 'em?

17:17.914 --> 17:19.148
- I hate them!

17:19.248 --> 17:21.184
- Oh, I'm so sorry,
it's okay.

17:21.284 --> 17:22.352
- SANDRA: I got the candles

17:22.452 --> 17:23.820
for Ms. Anastasia's
birthday cake.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.221
- Ssh!
- All 78 of them.

17:25.321 --> 17:27.390
Almost enough to light
the entire city of Atlanta.

17:27.490 --> 17:29.492
- ANASTASIA:
You planned a birthday?

17:29.592 --> 17:31.094
- Oh!

17:32.829 --> 17:35.131
No!

17:36.933 --> 17:38.835
- Thanks, Sandra.
- Me?

17:41.170 --> 17:43.840
- Well, money was good
while it lasted.

17:43.873 --> 17:47.043
- Mr. Brown, you do realize
we lost a lot of money?

17:47.143 --> 17:48.645
- Yeah, well, it's better
we lost it now

17:48.745 --> 17:51.848
than when I bought that
big ol' house on the hill.

17:51.881 --> 17:56.386
Buy all those luxury cars
and gold swimming pools,

17:56.486 --> 17:58.488
and all of that,
with a jachuzzi.

17:58.588 --> 18:02.292
I'd get me a jachuzzi with a
big ol' lion and everything.

18:02.392 --> 18:04.894
And I ain't giving all that
stuff back once I get it.

18:04.994 --> 18:07.096
No, mm-mm,
I wouldn't give it back.

18:08.464 --> 18:10.800
- Sad to see it all go.

18:10.833 --> 18:13.102
I mean, this is the most
popular I've ever been.

18:13.202 --> 18:16.272
Never had so many people
just throwing money at me.

18:16.372 --> 18:18.508
I see why my dad was a stripper.

18:18.608 --> 18:20.810
- We should've known
it was too good to be true.

18:20.877 --> 18:22.378
I'm glad it's leaving the house

18:22.478 --> 18:24.314
before Vinny
or Reginald kill each other

18:24.414 --> 18:26.282
with their brutal honesty.
- Yeah.

18:26.382 --> 18:28.818
- Well, I've got some good news.

18:28.918 --> 18:31.187
- You moving out, and you gon'
take Vinny with you.

18:31.287 --> 18:34.257
That's a good answer, go, move.

18:34.357 --> 18:36.459
- We need some good news,
what is it?

18:36.559 --> 18:38.227
- The Truth or Scare Law Firm

18:38.328 --> 18:40.663
is willing to take the drinks
off your hands.

18:40.830 --> 18:41.965
- What do we have to do?

18:42.065 --> 18:44.300
- What you've been doing,
pack it up and ship it out.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.835
I'll draw up the legal paperwork

18:45.902 --> 18:47.904
so that you can, uh,
sign over your business affairs.

18:48.004 --> 18:49.172
- Okay, cool,

18:49.272 --> 18:51.174
but what's a law firm doing
with energy drinks?

18:51.274 --> 18:52.375
- Evidently, they're gonna
use it

18:52.475 --> 18:54.110
to get their clients
to tell the truth.

18:54.210 --> 18:55.511
And they're gonna rebrand it.

18:55.612 --> 18:58.181
They're gonna call it
Wise Crack.

18:59.082 --> 18:59.983
- That's stupid.

19:00.083 --> 19:01.918
- Why didn't I think of that?

19:02.018 --> 19:03.586
- Because you're not wise.

19:03.686 --> 19:05.221
- ♪

19:05.321 --> 19:07.290
- I liked you moving out better,
that's for real.

19:09.755 --> 19:11.290
- We did, we did!
- Well, case disappear.

19:11.390 --> 19:15.161
- Cora, Leah, can I speak
with you for a moment?

19:15.261 --> 19:17.663
- Sure.
- CORA: Absolutely.

19:21.534 --> 19:24.270
- I'm sorry for the way
I behaved earlier.

19:24.370 --> 19:26.539
- No apologies necessary.

19:26.639 --> 19:30.910
- I just never liked birthdays
since my fourth husband died.

19:31.010 --> 19:34.713
He use to always surprise me,
and pop out of a cake.

19:34.813 --> 19:37.816
One year, he popped out
as G.I. Bro.

19:37.917 --> 19:39.652
with a Kung Fu Grip.

19:39.752 --> 19:42.822
And then another year,
he was Popeye the Sailor Man.

19:42.922 --> 19:44.089
- [laughing]
- Oh!

19:44.190 --> 19:47.393
- And then, the last year,
he popped out,

19:47.493 --> 19:49.261
got high on sugar and died.

19:49.361 --> 19:51.697
- I'm sorry to hear that.

19:51.797 --> 19:53.299
We don't have to have
a birthday party

19:53.399 --> 19:54.900
if you don't want to.
- LEAH: Mm-mm.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.303
- Well, you went through
the trouble of getting a cake.

19:57.403 --> 20:00.072
I just--
- It wasn't any trouble at all.

20:00.172 --> 20:03.242
- Okay, well,
can I have my chocolates?

20:03.342 --> 20:04.677
- [laughing]

20:04.777 --> 20:06.145
- Now, how did you
know about those?

20:06.245 --> 20:07.479
- Right?

20:07.580 --> 20:10.015
- Because I order them
every year for myself

20:10.115 --> 20:12.218
'cuz they're my favorites.

20:12.318 --> 20:13.953
- Oh, and Jeremy,
he act like he bought 'em.

20:14.053 --> 20:15.287
- He did.

20:15.387 --> 20:17.022
I thought he did.
I thought they were for me.

20:17.122 --> 20:18.424
- [laughing]

20:18.524 --> 20:21.327
- CORA: You know what?
We have something even better.

20:21.427 --> 20:23.863
- Mm-hm.
Sandra, baby?

20:23.963 --> 20:26.398
Come here [laughing]

20:26.499 --> 20:30.169
- Just in case.
- LEAH: Girl [laughing].

20:30.269 --> 20:31.470
There you go.

20:31.570 --> 20:33.839
- Wow!
Look at there.

20:33.939 --> 20:36.141
- Yes.

20:36.242 --> 20:40.045
- Oh, you guys are so sweet.

20:40.145 --> 20:41.547
- We love you, Ms. Anastasia.

20:41.647 --> 20:43.315
Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:43.415 --> 20:45.384
- And happy birthday.
- Yes.

20:45.484 --> 20:48.621
- Oh, thank you, thank you
so much.

20:48.754 --> 20:51.457
I love you, guys.
- BOTH: We love you, too.
