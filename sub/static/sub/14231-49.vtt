Don't choke now.
This is gonna be terrifical.

01:13.406 --> 01:18.286
Wait'll the spuds at the rod

01:18.370 --> 01:22.374

[Goofy] You OK, Petey?

01:43.353 --> 01:44.938
What do you think you're doin'?

01:45.021 --> 01:48.775
Oh, well, I was teachin' Waffles
to catch a frisbee in his mouth.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.319
[angry mumbling]

01:51.403 --> 01:54.447
He wasn't too handy with the shot put,
so I figured--

01:54.531 --> 01:57.200
Uh, say, Pete--
isn't dancing around on top

01:57.283 --> 01:58.993
Of a ladder like that kind of dangerous?

01:59.077 --> 02:01.329
-Whoa!
-hang on, Petey!

02:10.296 --> 02:11.840
Whoa!

02:13.675 --> 02:16.302
Get me down, you goofball!

02:35.155 --> 02:36.906
I'll get you down, Petey!

02:40.827 --> 02:42.579
But I think I'll need a longer ladder!

02:42.662 --> 02:43.872
Ah-hyuck!

Oh, I think I sprained my back pockets.

03:16.237 --> 03:18.823
You're lucky the ground broke your fall.

03:20.075 --> 03:23.578
You know the thing I like
best about you, Goofy?

03:23.661 --> 03:26.206
-No. What?
-Your absence!

03:26.289 --> 03:27.957
I oughta tie your ears in a knot

03:28.041 --> 03:29.292
and wind you up and--

03:29.376 --> 03:31.086
[Peg] Can you two male beasts

03:31.169 --> 03:32.629
stop marking territory for a moment

03:32.712 --> 03:34.547
and cut the rest of us a little slack?

03:34.631 --> 03:37.384
-But, turtle-toes, he--
-Hush, Peter.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.260
I'm teaching puppy some tricks.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.179
You oughta try that, Petey.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.390
Pets are a great way to keep calm.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.475
Pets are only good
for keeping your feet warm

03:45.558 --> 03:46.810
and blaming your mistakes on.

03:46.893 --> 03:51.147
[laughs] We're talking about
dogs and cats, Peter, not husbands!

03:51.231 --> 03:54.984
Now, pipe down and watch puppy
fetch the paper.

03:55.068 --> 03:59.489
All right, puppy! Let's show Daddy
what you can do!

03:59.572 --> 04:01.908
I know what that mutt could do,

04:01.991 --> 04:04.119
and one newspaper ain't nearly enough

04:04.202 --> 04:05.203
for cleaning it up.

04:05.286 --> 04:09.332
[grrr]

04:09.416 --> 04:13.878
Ooh! That's my little poopsy puppy-face!

04:13.962 --> 04:16.923
Would you look at this?
I need a pair of tongs.

04:17.007 --> 04:20.343
Well, she saved you a lot of reading time.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.761
Oh, yeah.

04:21.845 --> 04:25.306
And she fetched the most
boring part of the paper.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.433
Ha!

04:26.516 --> 04:28.560
What is it, Petey, double coupons?

04:28.643 --> 04:31.062
"Do you know these men?

04:31.146 --> 04:34.566
Information sought in gigantic manhunt."

04:34.649 --> 04:38.319
Hmm. You know, one of these guys
looks kinda familiar.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.739
Why, Goofy, that's you and Peter!

04:40.822 --> 04:43.408
Told ya I knew one! Ah-hyuck!

04:43.491 --> 04:45.827
Take cover.
They've finally come to get me.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.163
Who's come to get you? For what?

04:48.246 --> 04:51.666
How do I know? I can't remember
all the shady deals I've pulled.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.294
They wouldn't be after me if they thought
I did something right, would they?

04:54.377 --> 04:56.588
Then tell us, Dr. Einstein,

04:56.671 --> 04:59.215
why would they want Goofy, too?

04:59.299 --> 05:02.427
Because everybody knows he knows me

05:02.510 --> 05:05.096
and is too stupid to keep a secret.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.265
Uh, what secret?

05:07.349 --> 05:10.977
I'll tell you what secret!
I don't know what secret!

05:11.061 --> 05:13.188
And if I did know, I wouldn't
tell you 'cause you couldn't keep it!

05:13.271 --> 05:15.774
[both] Oh, that secret.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.905
I can feel it already. Eyes everywhere.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.491
In every closet! Under every bed!
On every potato!

05:24.574 --> 05:27.577
The sense of being watched
every minute of every day and every night!

05:27.660 --> 05:30.538
Ooh! Life on the run's not gonna be easy.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.248
I better travel light.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.251
Bye, diesel-doll.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.379
The less you know, the better.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.223
Well, nobody'll recognize me
in these babies.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.767
Hard to see with these things
at night, though.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.602
-[both grunt]
-[crashing]

05:52.686 --> 05:54.604
What do you think you're doing?

05:54.688 --> 05:58.108
Sorry, Pete. It's kind of hard
to see with these things on.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.695
Only a goofball would wear
these things after dark.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.530
Oh, I couldn't sleep, Petey,

06:03.613 --> 06:06.032
Knowing that I'm a wanted criminal.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.201
You and I have to talk. Hey!

06:08.284 --> 06:10.203
What are you doing?

06:10.704 --> 06:13.707
I'm going on the run,
underground, on the lam, see?

06:13.790 --> 06:17.585
-And you're going with me.
-You want me to come with you?

06:17.669 --> 06:21.923
Ah-hyuck! It'll be like one of them
on-the-road buddy movies.

06:22.007 --> 06:25.218
Yeah. It'll be worth it to make sure
you keep your yap shut about me.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.428
Thanks, Pete.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.930
You won't regret this.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.850

06:31.933 --> 06:33.518

06:42.986 --> 06:43.987
In here, quick!

06:51.745 --> 06:54.748
Petey, look! Ah-hyuck! We're on tv!

06:54.831 --> 06:58.001
[exclaims] why don't you just wear a big

06:58.084 --> 07:01.296
"here we are, come and get us"
sign around your neck?

07:01.379 --> 07:05.091
Oh! Ah-hyuck!

07:05.175 --> 07:07.469
Oh! Oh! Whoa!

07:08.345 --> 07:11.598
Sorry, Pete.
Stardom's a hard habit to kick.

07:12.390 --> 07:16.269
All right, now, our next stop
is the survival store for supplies.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.939
Just try not to extract
any attention to yourself.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.316
Got it. Roger.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.700

You've just won a year's supply

07:40.710 --> 07:43.046
of cured rattlesnake meat.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.047
What do you think of that, soldier?

07:44.130 --> 07:48.468
Ah-hyuck! Gawrsh!
A whole year! That's great!

07:48.551 --> 07:49.469
Isn't that great, Pete?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.596
Uh. Pete? Pete?

07:59.938 --> 08:02.524
Oh, relax, Pete,
and have some of this jerky.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.361
[rattling]

08:06.444 --> 08:08.029
Gotta careful of these things, though.

-Yuck!
-[doorbell rings]

08:12.951 --> 08:13.868
Hello?

08:13.952 --> 08:16.204
[both] Sir, I'm afraid you'll
have to come with me.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.541
Uh, which one of me
do you want us to go with?

08:19.624 --> 08:21.918
No, I'm not ready to go! I'm too young!

08:22.002 --> 08:24.045
I've never been to Disneyland!

08:24.129 --> 08:26.131
Take him! He's the one you want!

08:26.214 --> 08:28.717
[both]
You're right. He is the one we want.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.303
[gulps] Gawrsh, fellers,
can't we talk this over?

08:32.387 --> 08:36.433
Relax. You're getting an inheritance,
not the electric chair.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.101
Huh? An inheritance?

08:38.184 --> 08:41.771
An inheritance, eh?

08:45.275 --> 08:47.610

Yes. Come in. Come in.

-[crash]

09:12.052 --> 09:13.887
Uh, pleased to-- Oh!

09:15.096 --> 09:18.892
-Pleased to meet ya.
-You know, I'd feel better

09:18.975 --> 09:20.852
about bequeathing you the inheritance

09:20.935 --> 09:22.937
if your senior sibling

09:23.021 --> 09:25.023
was with you, or present, as we say.

09:25.357 --> 09:28.610
Gawrsh! I never been queathed before.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.278
What's a sibling anyway?

09:30.362 --> 09:33.198
-Your brother.
-Ah-hyuck! My brother?

09:33.281 --> 09:35.700
[man] Yes, your brother.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.037
Do I really want to pretend
to be that dipstick's brother

09:39.120 --> 09:41.623
for mere monetary compensation?

09:41.873 --> 09:44.584
You bet your earlobes I do.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.253
Oh, baby brother!

09:47.337 --> 09:50.423
-Where have you been all day?
-Pete?

09:50.507 --> 09:53.093
It's unlike you to wander off like that.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.427
It's not?

09:54.511 --> 09:57.472
He's not heavy. He's my brother.

09:57.555 --> 10:00.225
Ahh! Wait a minute.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.895
-How do I know you're his brother?
-Yeah!

10:03.978 --> 10:07.315
Would you claim to be this goof's brother
if it wasn't absolutely true?

10:07.399 --> 10:09.651
[both] He's your brother, all right.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.695
So, what do we get?

10:12.904 --> 10:16.783
[Pete] Ga-ha-aah...

10:16.866 --> 10:18.118
Gawrsh!

10:20.662 --> 10:23.581
Ahh, yes. There it is.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.750
I just can't believe this.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.712
[choking] Me, neither.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.132
Yes, it's all yours--

10:32.215 --> 10:35.468
Your very own rent-a-pet service.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.595
I just love-- what?

10:38.471 --> 10:41.766
Wh-wh-what about the mansion, the pool,

10:41.850 --> 10:44.019
the stable, the-the cars?

10:44.102 --> 10:46.438
Oh, well, that's not part of the will.

10:46.521 --> 10:50.984
You mean you thought that-- Ha ha ha ha!

10:51.067 --> 10:53.445
You thought that the pool--

10:53.528 --> 10:54.821
Oh, my!

10:55.613 --> 10:57.866
Ah-hyuck! Oh, what kind of pets are they?

10:57.949 --> 11:01.953
Uh, uh, beautiful exotic pets.

11:02.037 --> 11:06.207
-Yes, that's it-- exotic.
-Exotic, exmotic!

11:06.666 --> 11:08.501
I don't care how fancy they are,

11:08.585 --> 11:10.670
they ain't worth the cost
of cleaning up after.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.089
Well, that's not true in this case.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.133
In fact, the owner of this estate

11:15.216 --> 11:18.928
is quite an eccentric,
finds them so intriguing

11:19.012 --> 11:22.223
he pays a lot of money to have them
around most of the year.

11:22.307 --> 11:27.228
Yeah? You mean it's like we're collecting,

to carry the money?

Oh, come on, Petey.
Don't be such a party pooper.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.355
Everybody likes pets.

12:10.438 --> 12:14.109
Oh, yeah... yeah. That's it.

14:04.052 --> 14:07.180
But, Pete, they're our responsibility.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.599
We're supposed to take care of them.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.518
Look, little brother,

14:11.601 --> 14:14.604

Pete, you can't just sell these guys.
They're our friends.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.603
Well, then you better find
your friends a new home,

17:00.729 --> 17:04.441

to claim these poor creatures.

to take good care of them... or else!
