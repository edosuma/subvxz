LINDSAY:
Previously on "The Practice"...

00:04.090 --> 00:06.020
- Dad.

00:06.020 --> 00:07.180
- The principal says he got
a phone tip from a parent.

00:07.180 --> 00:09.130
Something about you dealing.
- I wasn't dealing.

00:09.130 --> 00:10.160
That's a lie.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.040
- Were they your drugs?
- No.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.140
- Then why were they
in your locker?

00:13.140 --> 00:15.100
- I don't know,
maybe I was set up.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.200
- Do you like my clock?

00:16.200 --> 00:19.110
It has a tiny camera in it,
a nanny cam.

00:19.110 --> 00:21.050
Two nights ago,
I come home,

00:21.050 --> 00:22.110
and I find this.

00:22.110 --> 00:23.150
- I'll meet him at 4:30.

00:23.150 --> 00:24.150
He's gonna give me eight bags.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.020
- But what if I get busted?

00:26.020 --> 00:27.210
KENDALL: My dad says,
"If you get caught,

00:27.210 --> 00:29.190
"never admit to anything,
even to your lawyer,

00:29.190 --> 00:31.220
because they'll be stuck
with whatever you tell 'em."

00:31.220 --> 00:33.220
- Who gave you the drugs?

00:33.220 --> 00:35.000
- Goes by Robby G.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.010
I don't know his full name.

00:36.010 --> 00:37.140
- Robby G.
- You know him?

00:37.140 --> 00:38.230
- He might work
for a client of mine.

00:38.230 --> 00:40.150
I'm not sure.
- That's nice.

00:40.150 --> 00:43.220
Father and son
both work for the same guy.

00:43.220 --> 00:45.170
I told my lawyer
I could handle this,

00:45.170 --> 00:48.060
but I forgot to ask whether
I needed witnesses to do this.

00:48.060 --> 00:49.150
- To do what?

00:49.150 --> 00:52.150
- To serve you
with this petition.

00:52.150 --> 00:54.090
- Change child custody?

00:54.090 --> 00:55.180
- I don't think you've been
a positive influence

00:55.180 --> 00:56.160
in Kendall's life.

01:01.130 --> 01:03.060
- I expect we'll do okay.

01:03.060 --> 01:05.209
No judge likes
to cut off custody,

01:05.209 --> 01:09.190
but Eugene, we could be
in for a real fight here.

01:09.190 --> 01:12.120
- I know.
- She hired Solomon Tager.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.140
Where she got the money
to do that,

01:13.140 --> 01:14.140
I don't know.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.170
What I do know is,

01:15.170 --> 01:19.030
this guy doesn't fool around.

01:19.030 --> 01:22.230
If I have to get ugly,
you have to let me.

01:22.230 --> 01:24.190
- I don't want you
tearing her up, Bobby.

01:24.190 --> 01:27.030
At the end of the day,
she's still my son's mother.

01:27.030 --> 01:28.100
- And at the end
of the day,

01:28.100 --> 01:31.200
we want you
to still be his father.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.020
- Dad?

01:33.020 --> 01:34.130
- Kendall,
what are you doing here?

01:34.130 --> 01:35.130
- I just came.

01:35.130 --> 01:36.130
I took the T.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.210
- Your mother know?

01:37.210 --> 01:39.100
- No.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.110
What's going on?

01:44.110 --> 01:46.040
I had to meet with
those doctors and stuff.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.230
Why is nobody telling me
what's going on?

01:53.210 --> 01:57.010
- Your mother thinks,

01:57.010 --> 02:00.010
um, your getting involved
with drugs

02:00.010 --> 02:02.140
has something to do
with my influence,

02:02.140 --> 02:08.100
and she thinks it would be best

02:08.100 --> 02:11.060
if you didn't
spend time with me.

02:11.060 --> 02:12.170
- Ever?

02:12.170 --> 02:14.170
- Just for a while.

02:14.170 --> 02:17.030
- But you're my dad.

02:17.030 --> 02:18.070
- It isn't about that.

02:18.070 --> 02:19.050
It's--

02:23.060 --> 02:27.090
She's doing
what she thinks is best.

02:27.090 --> 02:30.110
She loves you just like I do.

02:30.110 --> 02:34.110
We just disagree on what's best.

02:34.110 --> 02:37.200
- And she asking some judge
to stop you from being with me?

02:41.110 --> 02:44.050
- Something like that, yeah.

03:39.190 --> 03:41.010
- Come on,
we're gonna be late.

03:41.010 --> 03:42.020
ELLENOR: We got
plenty of time, Eugene.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.080
BOBBY: Who's up first?

03:43.080 --> 03:45.040
- The guardian ad litem,
Tanya Morrison.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.200
She takes a strong position;
she's tough.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.100
LINDSAY: Who's the judge?
- Bender.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.090
EUGENE: Come on.

03:52.120 --> 03:55.030
- Ms. Gamble.
- Hi.

03:55.030 --> 03:56.180
- Hi.
- Uh, listen.

03:56.180 --> 03:58.140
Unfortunately we weren't able
to reach a plea,

03:58.140 --> 04:00.140
so we go to trial.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.180
- Okay.

04:01.180 --> 04:03.060
- I'll be putting you on first,

04:03.060 --> 04:05.000
and remember,
we talked about his attorney.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.210
Listen, I'll do what I can
to protect you,

04:06.210 --> 04:09.130
but the main thing:
you have to keep your composure.

04:09.130 --> 04:11.110
- Okay.

04:11.110 --> 04:13.040
- He won't let her
get brutalized up there.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.110
- This attorney's tough.

04:14.110 --> 04:16.000
He's known for trying anything.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
- She's gonna be attacked,
isn't she?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
- Well,
defendants get the right

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
to confront their accusers,
Mr. Hayes,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.170
and this one will.

04:25.170 --> 04:28.070
- Kendall has
an above average IQ,

04:28.070 --> 04:31.010
but he appears to be lacking
some moral sensibility

04:31.010 --> 04:32.180
with regard to his behavior.

04:32.180 --> 04:34.080
- What do you mean, doctor?

04:34.080 --> 04:35.080
- With the drug arrest.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.080
He focuses on the illegal search

04:37.080 --> 04:39.170
rather than his own bad acts,

04:39.170 --> 04:41.200
and in lying to his parents
about it afterwards,

04:41.200 --> 04:45.050
he focuses on how his denial
skirted the truth.

04:45.050 --> 04:47.010
- Come on, doctor.

04:47.010 --> 04:50.120
Growing up, my children threw
every excuse imaginable at me.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.110
Isn't that just being a kid?

04:52.110 --> 04:54.230
- The normal kid understands
when he's done something wrong

04:54.230 --> 04:58.040
and uses the excuse
as a way to escape punishment.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.220
With Kendall,
it's almost as if

04:59.220 --> 05:03.120
he believes the excuse
nullifies the bad act,

05:03.120 --> 05:05.080
and therein lies the problem.

05:05.080 --> 05:08.090
- To what do you attribute
Kendall's behavior?

05:08.090 --> 05:10.080
- There could be
a lot of factors,

05:10.080 --> 05:12.030
but I do believe
a significant one

05:12.030 --> 05:14.220
derives from contact
with his father.

05:14.220 --> 05:16.050
- He's a bad role model?

05:16.050 --> 05:17.230
- I'm not saying that.

05:17.230 --> 05:19.210
Likely, he's a great role model.

05:19.210 --> 05:23.110
I'm saying that contact with him
is having a negative influence.

05:23.110 --> 05:26.040
- A good model
with a bad influence?

05:26.040 --> 05:28.150
- Mr. Young is
a criminal defense attorney.

05:28.150 --> 05:30.130
I certainly don't have
all the answers,

05:30.130 --> 05:33.010
but I know that Kendall
is somehow

05:33.010 --> 05:36.190
processing right and wrong
through his father's eyes,

05:36.190 --> 05:40.110
and it's resulting in a blurring
of the lines for him.

05:40.110 --> 05:42.220
- How many hours total
did you spend with Kendall?

05:42.220 --> 05:44.020
- About 6 1/2.

05:44.020 --> 05:46.120
- And in 6 1/2 hours,

05:46.120 --> 05:49.220
you find that Eugene Young
is a bad influence on his son?

05:49.220 --> 05:51.120
- Yes.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.020
- Because he's
a criminal defense attorney.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.040
- Because of the emotional
and behavioral impact

05:55.040 --> 05:56.200
he's had on his son.

05:56.200 --> 06:00.030
- Because he's
a criminal defense attorney.

06:00.030 --> 06:02.200
- Mr. Young
faces tough moral choices.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.070
Maybe he has a handle on it,
and maybe he doesn't.

06:05.070 --> 06:08.020
- When you say Mr. Young
faces tough moral choices,

06:08.020 --> 06:11.030
do you have any evidence
of Mr. Young acting amorally?

06:11.030 --> 06:12.070
- Well,
I think defending somebody

06:12.070 --> 06:13.230
accused of murder is perhaps--

06:13.230 --> 06:15.060
- It's immoral for
a criminal defense attorney

06:15.060 --> 06:16.230
to represent murder defendants?

06:16.230 --> 06:19.060
- I'm talking about how
it impacts on a child to see--

06:19.060 --> 06:21.000
- It's your opinion
that children can't process--

06:21.000 --> 06:22.110
- Your Honor, he's not
letting the witness finish.

06:22.110 --> 06:23.220
- I agree.

06:23.220 --> 06:26.220
Let her complete
her response, Mr. Donnell.

06:26.220 --> 06:30.090
- Of course every defendant
deserves representation.

06:30.090 --> 06:33.060
Most 11-year-olds
can appreciate this.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.160
I'm speaking as to
what's going on with Kendall.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.140
- Thank you, doctor, but how--
- I still haven't finished.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.120
By defending these people,

06:40.120 --> 06:43.070
the drug dealers,
the people that use drugs,

06:43.070 --> 06:46.110
Kendall sees an implied
endorsement of them.

06:46.110 --> 06:48.210
Dad says,
"These people are okay."

06:48.210 --> 06:52.040
Dad says, "What these people
did wasn't so bad."

06:52.040 --> 06:54.140
Dad says, "It's the police
who are at fault."

06:54.140 --> 06:57.140
These are the things
this kid is processing.

06:57.140 --> 07:00.150
It's not coming from his mother.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.150
- Thank you for taking the time.
- Sure.

07:05.150 --> 07:08.010
I'm going to have Lucy
take notes if you don't mind.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.020
- Sure.

07:09.020 --> 07:10.100
Well, as I said on the phone,

07:10.100 --> 07:12.110
I'm a practicing
child psychologist,

07:12.110 --> 07:14.190
and I was recently
discharged from my job

07:14.190 --> 07:17.140
for grounds I believe
to be illegal.

07:17.140 --> 07:19.010
- And what were the grounds?

07:19.010 --> 07:21.090
- I developed
a condition in my eyes,

07:21.090 --> 07:22.220
which they cited as cause.

07:22.220 --> 07:24.090
- What kind of condition?

07:24.090 --> 07:26.190
- It affects the muscles and--

07:26.190 --> 07:31.130
well, as you can see,
I'm rather cross-eyed.

07:36.130 --> 07:38.090
Can you tell?

07:38.090 --> 07:40.090
- Well, since you mention it.

07:40.090 --> 07:43.020
- And this is
why they fired you?

07:43.020 --> 07:44.040
- Yes.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.210
It's bilateral nerve palsy.

07:45.210 --> 07:47.170
I got it from a head trauma.

07:47.170 --> 07:51.050
Ms. Washington,
it does not render me disabled.

07:51.050 --> 07:54.090
I have been, and continue to be,
an excellent psychologist.

07:54.090 --> 07:56.000
I'm very good at what I do.

08:02.080 --> 08:05.020
- I spent most of the afternoon
walking around window shopping.

08:05.020 --> 08:06.020
Then I walked to my car.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.170
- And what happened?

08:07.170 --> 08:10.020
- As I started
to pull out, that man,

08:10.020 --> 08:12.120
he jumped in the passenger side.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.130
- What did you do?

08:13.130 --> 08:15.020
- I tried to jump out my side,

08:15.020 --> 08:17.080
but he grabbed my wrist
so I couldn't get out.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.170
- What happened then?

08:18.170 --> 08:20.040
- He pulled a knife
out of his jacket

08:20.040 --> 08:23.050
and pressed it
against my neck really hard.

08:23.050 --> 08:25.060
- Tell me, what was
going through your mind?

08:25.060 --> 08:27.160
- Fear.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.130
I was thinking,

08:29.130 --> 08:32.190
"If he had just wanted the car,
he would have let me jump out."

08:32.190 --> 08:34.230
I thought he was gonna hurt me.

08:34.230 --> 08:37.150
- What happened next?
- I started talking.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.140
- You started talking?
- Yes.

08:39.140 --> 08:41.010
I started telling him
about myself.

08:41.010 --> 08:43.100
I thought maybe
if he knew something about me,

08:43.100 --> 08:44.110
he wouldn't want to kill me.

08:44.110 --> 08:45.200
- Why did you think that?

08:45.200 --> 08:47.120
- I read that one strategy
with an attacker

08:47.120 --> 08:49.120
is to try to
humanize yourself with them

08:49.120 --> 08:51.110
so they won't kill you.

08:51.110 --> 08:53.150
- And it worked?

08:53.150 --> 08:55.140
- Yeah, I guess so,
because he told me to get out,

08:55.140 --> 08:58.180
which I did,
and then he drove away.

08:58.180 --> 09:00.220
- Any bruises on your wrist
or your neck?

09:00.220 --> 09:02.140
- I don't think so.

09:02.140 --> 09:04.160
- You never went to a hospital?
- No.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.230
- Can anybody account for your
whereabouts that afternoon,

09:06.230 --> 09:08.160
when you say you were
window shopping?

09:08.160 --> 09:10.130
- Not that I know of;
I was by myself.

09:10.130 --> 09:12.180
- Did you also
kiss Randy Strunk?

09:12.180 --> 09:14.140
- Excuse me?

09:14.140 --> 09:16.100
- The truth is, you met Randy,
you had consensual sex with him,

09:16.100 --> 09:17.220
and then
you loaned him your car.

09:17.220 --> 09:19.030
- Objection!
- Isn't that what happened?

09:19.030 --> 09:20.030
- Are you crazy?
- You would never

09:20.030 --> 09:21.110
sleep with someone you just met?

09:21.110 --> 09:22.160
- Objection!
- It's a fair question.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.150
- Sidebar, Your Honor.

09:31.130 --> 09:32.130
- She's been known
to pick up men,

09:32.130 --> 09:34.090
and not just with her car.

09:34.090 --> 09:36.070
- You've got to be kidding me.
- She's a social girl.

09:36.070 --> 09:38.150
I'm just showing--
- That is completely irrelevant.

09:38.150 --> 09:40.020
Even if it were true,

09:40.020 --> 09:41.100
a victim's sexual history
is inadmissible.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.000

my client's accuser.

- I won't let you go there,
Mr. Dawson.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
- You don't
know this woman, Judge.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.070
She's a real piece of--

09:50.070 --> 09:51.070
- Problem is, Counsel,
I know you.

09:51.070 --> 09:53.060
You're not going there.

09:58.010 --> 10:00.010
- He's a good man,
and in my opinion,

10:00.010 --> 10:01.150
a very good father.

10:01.150 --> 10:03.040
- Well, then why are we here?

10:03.040 --> 10:05.150
- We're here because of
the world he lives in.

10:05.150 --> 10:08.180
My ex-husband
fights for bad people.

10:08.180 --> 10:12.120
My son attributes
some idealism to this world.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.220
The influence scares me.

10:14.220 --> 10:17.020
He's begun to deal drugs

10:17.020 --> 10:18.140
with a sense of pride, even,

10:18.140 --> 10:21.020
a pride that he gets
from his dad.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.080
- Objecting that.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.210
- It would be one thing
if he came home

10:23.210 --> 10:25.130
wanting to defend criminals,

10:25.130 --> 10:28.030
but to identify with them
as role models?

10:28.030 --> 10:29.220
This is beginning to happen.

10:29.220 --> 10:32.030
- Have you talked
to your ex-husband about this?

10:32.030 --> 10:36.000
- My ex-husband
breathes this world.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.190
That's what led
to us splitting up.

10:37.190 --> 10:40.050
He's inside it.

10:40.050 --> 10:42.190
He defends these people
on a mission.

10:42.190 --> 10:45.120
It was more important to him
than being a husband,

10:45.120 --> 10:47.070
more important
than being a father.

10:47.070 --> 10:48.230
- Objection.
That isn't true, Sharon.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.230

10:57.010 --> 10:59.220

what you're doing to him.

10:59.220 --> 11:03.010
JUDGE BENDER: Ms. Young, please
do not address your ex-husband.

11:07.090 --> 11:08.180
- That was a lie.
- It doesn't matter.

11:08.180 --> 11:10.000
- You just sat there.
- Eugene.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.210
- You just let her
go on with that.

11:11.210 --> 11:13.100
- I'll get my chance on cross.
- You should have shut her down!

11:13.100 --> 11:15.160
- Eugene, you know
she gets to tell her side.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.230
You know I had to let her.

11:16.230 --> 11:18.110
- She knows my values,

11:18.110 --> 11:20.000
she knows I don't honor
the people I defend,

11:20.000 --> 11:21.140
and she knows
Kendall knows that.

11:21.140 --> 11:24.030
- Tager probably told her
to come on strong.

11:24.030 --> 11:25.190
Like I said,
these kinds of fights

11:25.190 --> 11:28.050
you don't win by holding back.

11:28.050 --> 11:30.110
Eugene, look at me.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.130
Now it's my turn.

11:34.130 --> 11:37.080
I don't want to hold back.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.070
Anything you got on her
that I can use,

11:39.070 --> 11:42.050
now's the time to tell me.

11:42.050 --> 11:43.080
I'm friends with Sharon.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.130
I don't want to go after her,

11:44.130 --> 11:47.020
but if you want
your son back...

11:50.010 --> 11:51.180
I have no real choice.

13:36.110 --> 13:37.200
no more than a couple minutes.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.110

13:52.130 --> 13:53.200

13:53.200 --> 13:55.140

And you have allergies.

your virginity in a car.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.200

I was trying to talk to him
about my life,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.150

14:39.040 --> 14:41.080

14:44.090 --> 14:46.230
which we can bring

14:46.230 --> 14:48.190
It did succeed

14:48.190 --> 14:50.050
- Which means?

14:50.050 --> 14:52.040
- Dr. Fairby,
your boss, and his lawyer

14:52.040 --> 14:53.210
are coming for a meeting.

14:53.210 --> 14:56.190

15:34.180 --> 15:36.140
Possible you share
some blame for his problems,

15:36.140 --> 15:38.050
or is that just impossible?

15:38.050 --> 15:39.160
- I lived with Eugene
for nine years.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.150
I know where the blame goes.

15:41.150 --> 15:44.100
Plan B, I know that too.
- Plan B?

15:44.100 --> 15:45.230
What's that got to do
with Eugene's parenting?

15:45.230 --> 15:47.190
- It's got to do with Kendall
always bragging

15:47.190 --> 15:49.230
that his dad
can get anybody off.

15:49.230 --> 15:51.200
- He's a bad parent for the way
he defends his clients?

15:51.200 --> 15:53.070
- He's a bad influence

15:53.070 --> 15:55.140
when it comes to teaching him
accountability.

15:55.140 --> 15:57.000

15:57.000 --> 15:59.130
refusing to accept
any responsibility?

15:59.130 --> 16:01.210
What message on accountability
does that send?

16:01.210 --> 16:03.080
- I'm accepting responsibility

16:03.080 --> 16:05.140
to set my son's life
back on course.

16:05.140 --> 16:07.050
I'm taking the steps necessary

16:07.050 --> 16:10.030
to see that he's raised
with the right values.

16:10.030 --> 16:13.030
- So your concern in all this

16:13.030 --> 16:15.100
is that Kendall
learn the right values?

16:15.100 --> 16:16.100
- Yes.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.220
- And you don't think

16:17.220 --> 16:19.060
that Eugene is teaching
those values to Kendall?

16:19.060 --> 16:20.230
- No, I don't.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.030
- And values,
that's one of the reasons

16:22.030 --> 16:23.100
you got divorced.

16:23.100 --> 16:26.020
Your difference
of opinion on values?

16:30.200 --> 16:32.150
You had an affair,
didn't you, Sharon?

16:32.150 --> 16:33.220
- That was four years ago, and--

16:33.220 --> 16:35.030
- How long did that affair last?

16:35.030 --> 16:36.120
- Objection, Your Honor!

16:36.120 --> 16:37.210
What relevance is
an event that happened--

16:37.210 --> 16:39.100
- Excuse me,
but this witness is saying

16:39.100 --> 16:41.160
that my client's character
is deficient,

16:41.160 --> 16:43.200
and that his son
gleaned these deficiencies.

16:43.200 --> 16:47.110
I should be allowed to question
the petitioner on her character.

16:47.110 --> 16:49.170
- I'll allow it.

16:49.170 --> 16:52.060
Answer the question.

16:52.060 --> 16:54.100
- The affair
lasted about two months.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.150
- And during the affair,
on more than a few occasions,

16:56.150 --> 16:58.220
you told Eugene that you were
having dinner with a girlfriend,

16:58.220 --> 17:00.140
or you were working late,
when in fact,

17:00.140 --> 17:02.190
you were seeing this man;
isn't that right?

17:02.190 --> 17:04.190
- It was wrong.
I know that, but--

17:04.190 --> 17:07.099
- You were lying to him.
- Yes.

17:07.099 --> 17:09.180
- And did Kendall know
you were lying to his father?

17:09.180 --> 17:11.089
What kind of influence?

17:11.089 --> 17:13.010
- Kendall never found out about
either the affair or--

17:13.010 --> 17:14.060
- So your son
still doesn't know the truth.

17:14.060 --> 17:15.079
The deception lives on.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.180
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

17:16.180 --> 17:18.079
The man you were seeing
was married, right?

17:18.079 --> 17:19.079
- Yes.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.089
- What kind of values does that

17:20.089 --> 17:21.119
teach your son, Sharon?

17:21.119 --> 17:23.050
What kind of values does he get

17:23.050 --> 17:24.200
from a mother's
infidelity and adultery?

17:24.200 --> 17:26.170
- Objection!
- Sustained.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.010
Move on.

17:28.010 --> 17:30.110
- You complained
about Eugene's job.

17:30.110 --> 17:32.100
You ever once ask him
to quit his job?

17:32.100 --> 17:34.020
- I knew he would never--

17:34.020 --> 17:35.100
- The question was,
did you ever ask him to quit?

17:35.100 --> 17:37.050
Yes or no?
- No, that doesn't--

17:37.050 --> 17:39.180
- You ever urge him
to demand to be made partner?

17:39.180 --> 17:41.190
That ever happen?
- Yes.

17:41.190 --> 17:45.070
- So this world he lives in,
which you so object to,

17:45.070 --> 17:48.170
you wanted him to become
a partner in it.

17:48.170 --> 17:50.140
You get alimony.
don't you, Sharon?

17:50.140 --> 17:51.140
- Yes.

17:51.140 --> 17:52.200
- You make money off this world,

17:52.200 --> 17:54.110
you urged him to go for partner,

17:54.110 --> 17:56.050
and now you cite that world

17:56.050 --> 17:58.060
as ground
for parental unfitness.

17:58.060 --> 18:00.170
Is hypocrisy a value
you pass on to Kendall?

18:00.170 --> 18:02.020
- Objection.
- Overruled.

18:02.020 --> 18:03.180
- The best interest
of the child, Sharon,

18:03.180 --> 18:06.070
does that include
infidelity, lying, hypocrisy?

18:06.070 --> 18:07.110
- Objection.
- Mr. Donnell.

18:07.110 --> 18:09.010
- After you drew
this conclusion

18:09.010 --> 18:10.090
that Eugene's job
wasn't good for Kendall,

18:10.090 --> 18:11.110
did you go to Eugene and say,

18:11.110 --> 18:12.200
"Hey, what do we
do about this?"

18:12.200 --> 18:14.230
Or did you just move
for full custody?

18:14.230 --> 18:16.060
- He's not going to change.

18:16.060 --> 18:17.210
- You just filed
for full custody

18:17.210 --> 18:19.030

as a conversation,

18:19.030 --> 18:20.220

18:20.220 --> 18:22.110

with his dad

19:37.220 --> 19:40.030
where you can't even
see his eyes?

19:40.030 --> 19:42.010
- I'd deal with it.

19:42.010 --> 19:45.110
- Look, part of the job
is cultivating new clientele.

19:45.110 --> 19:46.200
Gerry is unable to do this.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.100
Look, I like the guy.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.140
I wouldn't do this
if I didn't have to.

19:53.190 --> 19:56.000
- I'd seen Lynette Hayes around,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.180
and I'd always
wanted to meet her.

19:58.180 --> 20:00.010
I saw her
walking across the street

20:00.010 --> 20:02.150
looking into some store window.

20:02.150 --> 20:05.010
- What did you do?

20:05.010 --> 20:06.210
- I thought, "What the hell,"

20:06.210 --> 20:09.230
so I crossed over,
and I went to say hello.

20:09.230 --> 20:11.060
- And what happened?

20:11.060 --> 20:12.220
- I kind of put
a light hit on her.

20:12.220 --> 20:16.020
She seemed receptive,
so we just started talking.

20:16.020 --> 20:17.200
- How long
were the two of you

20:17.200 --> 20:21.000
talking out there on the street?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.040
- A few minutes.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.110
Then we started walking.

20:24.110 --> 20:26.010
We got to where she was parked,

20:26.010 --> 20:28.110
and then we were just
leaning against her car

20:28.110 --> 20:31.140
talking some more.

20:31.140 --> 20:33.100
- Did the two of you
get inside the car?

20:33.100 --> 20:34.210
- Yeah.

20:34.210 --> 20:37.060
We were getting
kind of cold standing outside.

20:37.060 --> 20:40.010
She asked me,
did I want to get in?

20:40.010 --> 20:42.210
- What happened once
the two of you were in the car?

20:42.210 --> 20:44.000
- She ran the heater
for a while,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.030
and we listened to some music.

20:46.030 --> 20:48.210
Then we fooled around.

20:48.210 --> 20:50.180
- So after just meeting you,

20:50.180 --> 20:54.030
she found you so irresistible
she just had to have you?

20:54.030 --> 20:55.180
- I guess so.

20:55.180 --> 20:57.230
- Then you made such
a favorable impression

20:57.230 --> 20:59.210
she just gave you her car?

20:59.210 --> 21:01.030
- No.

21:01.030 --> 21:03.040
She loaned it to me.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.230
I had lost track of time,

21:04.230 --> 21:07.040
and I was really late
for a job interview

21:07.040 --> 21:09.000
that I had across town.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.040
The job was really
important to me,

21:11.040 --> 21:13.150
and it was too late
for me to catch a bus.

21:13.150 --> 21:16.230
- So instead of offering
to drive you herself,

21:16.230 --> 21:19.210
she just gave her car
to a complete stranger?

21:19.210 --> 21:22.080
- Well, we weren't
total strangers at that point.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.210
And anyway, she had some things
she needed to get done,

21:25.210 --> 21:27.210
and so I was supposed to
meet her back there

21:27.210 --> 21:30.020
at that street at 5:00.

21:30.020 --> 21:32.120
- But you decided
to keep the car instead.

21:32.120 --> 21:36.170
- I got lost trying to find
the warehouse across town

21:36.170 --> 21:38.050
where I was supposed to
meet with this guy

21:38.050 --> 21:39.220
in shipping and receiving.

21:39.220 --> 21:43.040
Anyway, by the time I got back,
she was gone.

21:43.040 --> 21:46.180
- So you figured free car.
- No.

21:46.180 --> 21:50.180
I didn't have her phone number
or her last name.

21:50.180 --> 21:53.050
I was searching
for her registration,

21:53.050 --> 21:57.010
and that's when
the police arrested me.

21:57.010 --> 21:58.190
That's the truth.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.080
- Still love me?

22:11.080 --> 22:12.090
- She started it.

22:12.090 --> 22:13.160
I know that.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.080
- And she's not finished,
Eugene.

22:16.080 --> 22:19.080
Tomorrow morning,
you're on that stand.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.150
They'll be coming after you.

22:21.150 --> 22:22.190
- Yeah.

22:22.190 --> 22:25.080
- You can't lose control.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.210
You can't seem
erratic or volatile.

22:27.210 --> 22:30.150
You have to
remain calm in that chair.

22:30.150 --> 22:33.190
- It's a little easier
said than done.

22:33.190 --> 22:38.040
- You'll do it
because of the stakes.

22:38.040 --> 22:41.230
You'll do it.

22:41.230 --> 22:45.070
- I can't figure
how this happened.

22:45.070 --> 22:48.130
Custody battles,
divorce.

22:48.130 --> 22:50.050
I know how it can
turn into runaway hate,

22:50.050 --> 22:52.040
but Sharon and me?

22:52.040 --> 22:54.070
We get along.

22:54.070 --> 22:55.200
We still love each other.

22:55.200 --> 22:59.180
I know we both love Kendall.

23:02.120 --> 23:05.200
How'd this happen?

23:05.200 --> 23:13.180
<i>♪</i> ♪

23:18.140 --> 23:22.050
- What's up?

23:22.050 --> 23:25.020
- Well, I guess my radar.

23:25.020 --> 23:26.040
- What's going on?

23:26.040 --> 23:28.140
- Lynette, I could be way off,

23:28.140 --> 23:30.120
but I get a gut feeling
with witnesses,

23:30.120 --> 23:34.100
and after listening
to Randy Strunk's testimony,

23:34.100 --> 23:36.070
it had a believable ring to it.

23:36.070 --> 23:37.200
- You're not serious.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.000
- There's just
a couple of things

23:39.000 --> 23:41.030
that don't exactly make sense.

23:41.030 --> 23:42.130
After he took the car,

23:42.130 --> 23:44.080
he then returned
to the same area.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.080
He didn't change the plates.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.210
He acted like
an innocent person.

23:48.210 --> 23:52.000
- Why would I say
he just stole my car?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.140
- Is it possible
you thought he did

23:53.140 --> 23:55.090
when he didn't
come back soon enough?

23:55.090 --> 23:57.000
- No.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.160
He carjacked me.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.130
- Mr. and Mrs. Hayes,

24:03.130 --> 24:05.040
could you excuse us
for a second?

24:05.040 --> 24:07.130
I--
- Helen, what's this about?

24:07.130 --> 24:09.190
- I need to speak
with your daughter in private.

24:09.190 --> 24:11.000
Please.

24:27.120 --> 24:30.080
Lynette, if you are
making this up,

24:30.080 --> 24:32.010
a man is facing jail.

24:32.010 --> 24:34.090
- I'm not making this up.
- He carjacked you.

24:34.090 --> 24:37.190
- Yes.

24:37.190 --> 24:39.010
- Look, I know it was
your father

24:39.010 --> 24:40.150
who reported this to the police.

24:40.150 --> 24:43.030
Are you just sticking
to the story you gave him?

24:43.030 --> 24:45.030
- No.

24:45.030 --> 24:47.040
It's the truth.

24:52.220 --> 24:54.140
- If anything,
Kendall needs to spend

24:54.140 --> 24:56.230
more time with me,
not less.

24:56.230 --> 24:58.200
- How did Kendall
get those drugs?

24:58.200 --> 25:00.030
- He got them from someone

25:00.030 --> 25:02.110
who works for
a former client of mine.

25:02.110 --> 25:04.120
It was an unfortunate
coincidence.

25:04.120 --> 25:07.120
- Did you ever introduce Kendall
to this former client of yours?

25:07.120 --> 25:08.140
- Of course not.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.150
- Have you ever,
in any way,

25:09.150 --> 25:10.220
conveyed to Kendall

25:10.220 --> 25:12.160
that it was okay
to take or sell drugs?

25:12.160 --> 25:14.020
- No.

25:14.020 --> 25:15.090
- Why do you think
your ex-wife

25:15.090 --> 25:16.230
blames you
for Kendall's problems?

25:16.230 --> 25:19.040
- Sharon has always had
ideological problems

25:19.040 --> 25:20.150
with my job.

25:20.150 --> 25:22.080
I think when
this arrest happened,

25:22.080 --> 25:24.110
it hit a lot
of nerves and fears.

25:24.110 --> 25:25.200
I also think she blames

25:25.200 --> 25:27.200
the failure of our marriage
on my job,

25:27.200 --> 25:31.080
and she's reliving
a lot of that anger, I guess.

25:31.080 --> 25:32.230
- Can you understand that?

25:32.230 --> 25:34.200
- I can understand her fear.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.110
When Kendall got arrested,
I was afraid too.

25:36.110 --> 25:39.000
I also got angry.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.160
But I do not understand
her punishing me,

25:41.160 --> 25:45.020
and I certainly don't understand
her punishing Kendall,

25:45.020 --> 25:47.020
and that's what
you're doing, Sharon.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.100
- Your son got arrested
for possessing drugs,

25:54.100 --> 25:56.160
drugs that he bought
off of one of your clients.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.130
- That was a coincidence,
as I said.

25:58.130 --> 26:01.150
- Your lawyer, Ms. Frutt,
she was recently arrested

26:01.150 --> 26:03.170
on drug charges herself,
wasn't she?

26:03.170 --> 26:04.220
- Those charges were dismissed.

26:04.220 --> 26:06.180
She was set up by the police.

26:06.180 --> 26:08.020
- That's exactly
what Kendall said

26:08.020 --> 26:09.090
when you asked him
how the drugs

26:09.090 --> 26:10.210
ended up in his locker,
isn't it?

26:10.210 --> 26:12.210
- Except in Ellenor's case
it was true.

26:12.210 --> 26:15.020
- A client dropped a bag
of what was thought to be drugs

26:15.020 --> 26:16.030
on Ms. Frutt's desk.

26:16.030 --> 26:17.120
- That's right.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.060
- And when asked
who the drugs belonged to,

26:19.060 --> 26:22.130
Ms. Frutt responded,
"I don't know," didn't she?

26:22.130 --> 26:24.010
- Yes.
- But she knew

26:24.010 --> 26:26.050
where the drugs came from,
didn't she?

26:26.050 --> 26:27.050
- As lawyers,
we have a duty

26:27.050 --> 26:28.170
not to betray our clients.

26:28.170 --> 26:31.210
- So Ms. Frutt
did the right thing by lying?

26:31.210 --> 26:34.120
- In that context,
it wasn't lying.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.120
- It was telling the truth?

26:35.120 --> 26:36.140
- No.
- Which was it?

26:36.140 --> 26:37.180
- It was protecting our client,

26:37.180 --> 26:39.020
which,
as you well know,

26:39.020 --> 26:40.060
we have an ethical
obligation to do.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.080
- Yes.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.000
Did you sit down
and explain that

26:43.000 --> 26:44.050
to your son, Mr. Young?

26:44.050 --> 26:45.050
- Kendall knows
about our duties.

26:45.050 --> 26:46.150
We have these talks--

26:46.150 --> 26:48.000
- No, I'm not talking
in general.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.140
I'm referring to
that specific occasion

26:49.140 --> 26:52.140
after he witnessed Ellenor Frutt
lying to the police.

26:52.140 --> 26:55.030
Did you sit down and explain
the situation to him?

26:55.030 --> 26:56.220
- Not that time, no.

26:56.220 --> 26:58.080
- Can you honestly say
that you have

26:58.080 --> 27:00.090
taught Kendall
right from wrong,

27:00.090 --> 27:01.160
truth from lies?

27:01.160 --> 27:03.180
- I have never, ever
encouraged my son

27:03.180 --> 27:05.170
to break the law or to lie.

27:09.220 --> 27:11.180
- My dad says,
"If you get caught,

27:11.180 --> 27:13.220
"never admit to anything,
even to your lawyer,

27:13.220 --> 27:16.180
because they'll be stuck
with whatever you tell 'em."

27:22.150 --> 27:24.230
- I never told him that.

27:24.230 --> 27:26.130
- Is that the truth
or a justifiable lie?

27:26.130 --> 27:28.030
- Objection!

27:28.030 --> 27:29.210
- Kendall knows what I do
for a living, Mr. Tager.

27:29.210 --> 27:31.180
- Yes, in fact,
he spends a lot of time

27:31.180 --> 27:33.060
at your office, doesn't he?

27:33.060 --> 27:34.190
- Until this happened.

27:34.190 --> 27:36.120
- He was right there
when the police charged in

27:36.120 --> 27:38.230
with their guns
arresting Ellenor Frutt.

27:38.230 --> 27:41.030
He was even in the line of fire,
wasn't he?

27:41.030 --> 27:42.190
- You know that wasn't
a common occurrence.

27:42.190 --> 27:46.030
- On average,
how many waking hours a week

27:46.030 --> 27:48.140
do you spend with your son
outside the office?

27:48.140 --> 27:50.010
- I work a lot of hours.

27:50.010 --> 27:52.040
That's why he's with me at work.

27:52.040 --> 27:54.010
- And that's his exposure
to you, isn't it?

27:54.010 --> 27:55.070
Eugene Young, the lawyer.

27:55.070 --> 27:56.070
- And father.

27:56.070 --> 27:57.130
And father.

27:57.130 --> 27:59.020
- Father at work.

28:01.170 --> 28:03.010
Reference was made earlier
to plan B.

28:03.010 --> 28:04.030
What is that?

28:04.030 --> 28:05.160
- It's a defense strategy.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.190
- More specifically,
it means accusing someone

28:07.190 --> 28:10.040
in open court
of committing the crime.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.140
- Basically.

28:11.140 --> 28:13.110
- According to recent
court transcripts,

28:13.110 --> 28:14.190
you accused a brother
of beheading his sister

28:14.190 --> 28:16.050
even though you didn't believe

28:16.050 --> 28:18.050
that he was really
involved in the death.

28:18.050 --> 28:20.040
Correct?
- Yes.

28:20.040 --> 28:22.090
- Ever sit down
and talk to Kendall

28:22.090 --> 28:25.210
about why
you do these things in court?

28:25.210 --> 28:28.000
- Yes, I have.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
- Ever been booked
on assault, Mr. Young?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.210
- Once.
The charge was dropped.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.220
- Yeah, you got mad
at one of your clients

28:33.220 --> 28:35.080
who sodomized two young boys.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.200
You beat him up
in open court, right?

28:36.200 --> 28:37.200
- Objection!

28:37.200 --> 28:38.200
This has no relevance.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.020
- Everything is fair game.

28:40.020 --> 28:42.120
You made that clear.
- All right.

28:42.120 --> 28:46.080
I'll give you a little latitude,
Mr. Tager.

28:46.080 --> 28:49.080
- When this case was filed,
you were under court order

28:49.080 --> 28:51.110
not to discuss the merits of it
with your son Kendall.

28:51.110 --> 28:52.200
Is that right, sir?
- Yes.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.010
- You talk to him about it
two nights ago?

28:55.010 --> 28:57.010
- He was confused
as to what was going on.

28:57.010 --> 28:59.150
- You basically tell him
that his mother was wrong?

28:59.150 --> 29:03.050
- I told him we disagree
as to what was best.

29:03.050 --> 29:04.220
- Well, would it surprise you
if he went home

29:04.220 --> 29:06.220
with the idea
that you thought she was wrong?

29:06.220 --> 29:09.090
Night before the hearing,
you violate a court order,

29:09.090 --> 29:12.030
position your son
on your version of the merits.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.130
Are these the good footsteps
for a son to step in?

29:24.010 --> 29:26.110
- He's being fired
for a medical condition.

29:26.110 --> 29:27.150
That's contrary to law.

29:27.150 --> 29:29.000
- He's being terminated

29:29.000 --> 29:31.050
for an inability
to perform the functions--

29:31.050 --> 29:32.220
- Appearance is not a function.

29:32.220 --> 29:34.120
He has sixth nerve palsy

29:34.120 --> 29:36.060
brought about by head trauma,
and there's no--

29:36.060 --> 29:38.200
- Look, I don't know much
about psychology, Counsel,

29:38.200 --> 29:42.160
but I do suspect that if I were
to go see a therapist

29:42.160 --> 29:44.120
to unearth my troubles,

29:44.120 --> 29:47.160
it wouldn't help to have him
look back at me cross-eyed.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.130
- And that is bigotry.

29:49.130 --> 29:51.040
So he looks different.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.190
In time--
- Step up here, Mr. Pyle.

29:53.190 --> 29:57.040
Dr. Pyle.

29:57.040 --> 30:00.090
Okay, I'm looking
to get an idea.

30:00.090 --> 30:03.090
My mother-in-law
has got delirium.

30:03.090 --> 30:05.020
Tell us what that is.

30:05.020 --> 30:08.020
- Delirium is basically
a disturbance of consciousness.

30:08.020 --> 30:09.180
It can affect cognition,

30:09.180 --> 30:11.190
often manifested
by a reduced clarity

30:11.190 --> 30:13.120
of awareness of the environment.

30:13.120 --> 30:15.130
It can cause focus problems.

30:15.130 --> 30:18.010
Attention deficit problems
are common.

30:18.010 --> 30:21.200
The person is frequently
easily distracted

30:21.200 --> 30:24.040
by irrelevant stimuli,

30:24.040 --> 30:27.060
and it's often difficult
to engage

30:27.060 --> 30:30.020
in long, sustained
periods of conversation.

30:30.020 --> 30:32.030
There's also disorientation
as to time--

30:32.030 --> 30:33.050
- I'm sorry.

30:33.050 --> 30:34.100
I'm upholding the discharge.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.190
- Your Honor.

30:35.190 --> 30:37.230
- Ms. Washington,
this may not seem fair,

30:37.230 --> 30:40.080
but it's tough
to take him seriously.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.180
- You can't penalize him
for something he can't control.

30:42.180 --> 30:44.110
- Nor should I penalize them.

30:44.110 --> 30:47.230
Dr. Pyle,
you may be an excellent doctor,

30:47.230 --> 30:50.150
but medicine is business
these days too.

30:50.150 --> 30:52.050
And under the adage,

30:52.050 --> 30:55.080
"You only get one chance
to make a first impression,"

30:55.080 --> 30:57.180
I have to sympathize
with the defendant as well.

30:57.180 --> 30:59.000
- This isn't fair.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.050
- And your problem,
young lady,

31:00.050 --> 31:02.140
is that you think
justice is fair.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.090
- I'm not a big fan of ex parte.

31:08.090 --> 31:10.190
What's the mystery?

31:10.190 --> 31:12.190
- I'm not sure
I have good-faith belief

31:12.190 --> 31:14.190
in the defendant's
guilt anymore.

31:14.190 --> 31:17.050
- Why?

31:17.050 --> 31:19.150
- I guess it comes down
to credibility.

31:19.150 --> 31:22.010
My gut tells me
she fed her father this story,

31:22.010 --> 31:24.210
he insisted on the arrest,
and she's cornered.

31:24.210 --> 31:26.210
- What have you got
to support this?

31:26.210 --> 31:28.130
- Oh, just listening
to their testimony.

31:28.130 --> 31:30.140
I think I believe him.

31:30.140 --> 31:31.140
- So what?

31:31.140 --> 31:33.010
You're not the jury.

31:33.010 --> 31:34.010
- Still,
if a DA doesn't have

31:34.010 --> 31:35.130
a good-faith belief--

31:35.130 --> 31:37.040
- That may affect
your bringing the charges,

31:37.040 --> 31:38.190
but your weighing the testimony
is irrelevant.

31:38.190 --> 31:40.060
Come on.

31:40.060 --> 31:42.200
- And if I brought
a motion to dismiss?

31:42.200 --> 31:45.020
- Forget it.

31:45.020 --> 31:47.170
And don't tank
your closing, either.

31:47.170 --> 31:49.080
Defense attorneys
aren't the only ones

31:49.080 --> 31:51.140
with obligations
in that room.

31:59.230 --> 32:01.100
- Why'd you do this, Sharon?

32:01.100 --> 32:03.010
- Here you go,
disobeying another court order.

32:03.010 --> 32:05.180
We're not supposed
to talk about this outside.

32:11.050 --> 32:13.230
- Why'd you do this?

32:19.130 --> 32:21.220
- I know you love him.

32:24.030 --> 32:26.190
But I also know I'm losing him.

32:28.230 --> 32:32.200
If it were to you, Eugene,
I could deal with it,

32:32.200 --> 32:35.090
but I'm losing him
to something that--

32:38.190 --> 32:43.220
He's a good kid
becoming a bad kid.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.060
You don't see that,

32:45.060 --> 32:49.130
either because
you don't want to,

32:49.130 --> 32:51.180
or you can't.

32:58.030 --> 33:00.190
- Do you really
think he's better...

33:07.080 --> 33:09.160
Cut off from me?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.070
- Yes.

33:14.070 --> 33:17.070
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

33:17.070 --> 33:25.050
<i>♪</i> ♪

33:43.110 --> 33:45.050
- This isn't about
who's a better person

33:45.050 --> 33:46.230
or who loves Kendall more.

33:46.230 --> 33:49.150
It's what's
in the boy's best interests.

33:49.150 --> 33:52.040
We've listened
to the guardian ad litem,

33:52.040 --> 33:54.120
somebody who is neutral,
linking Kendall's problems

33:54.120 --> 33:56.190
to his contact with his father.

33:56.190 --> 34:00.150
A boy losing an ability
to distinguish right from wrong.

34:00.150 --> 34:02.160
We all saw that tape.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.140
An 11-year-old boy

34:04.140 --> 34:07.020
versed on the how-tos
of drug dealing.

34:07.020 --> 34:09.110
Who in this room
wasn't horrified?

34:09.110 --> 34:11.179
Eugene Young was sued
for intentional infliction

34:11.179 --> 34:14.040
of emotional distress when,
in open court,

34:14.040 --> 34:16.190
he accused a brother
of killing his own sister,

34:16.190 --> 34:21.010
an allegation he admittedly
didn't really believe.

34:21.010 --> 34:24.159
And in defense of Eugene Young,
his colleague, Jimmy Berluti,

34:24.159 --> 34:28.170
described him
as being in extreme denial,

34:28.170 --> 34:33.170
a man struggling to survive
what he does for a living.

34:33.170 --> 34:37.219
That struggle
is affecting Kendall.

34:37.219 --> 34:41.040
We're not asking for punishment,
or that it be permanent,

34:41.040 --> 34:44.070
but for now,

34:44.070 --> 34:46.110
we have to follow
Dr. Morrison's recommendation

34:46.110 --> 34:49.190
and appoint Sharon Young
as full custodian.

34:51.159 --> 34:54.120
In the end, it's not about
a mother or a father.

34:54.120 --> 34:58.030
It's about the welfare
of an 11-year-old boy

34:58.030 --> 35:02.050
who very clearly needs help.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.060
- We see young kids in this room
every day arrested for drugs.

35:12.060 --> 35:14.130
We don't take them
away from their parents.

35:14.130 --> 35:16.030
Just the opposite.

35:16.030 --> 35:19.030
The courts usually plead
for the parents to step in.

35:19.030 --> 35:21.210
That's exactly what Eugene Young
would like to do.

35:21.210 --> 35:26.010
This is a huge overreaction
to a bad event.

35:26.010 --> 35:27.110
There is nothing--

35:27.110 --> 35:31.080
nothing to even suggest
any parental unfitness.

35:31.080 --> 35:35.050
Mr. Tager quoted Jimmy Berluti's
closing argument as evidence.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.150
Well, he left out
the part of the summation

35:36.150 --> 35:39.110
where Mr. Berluti
referred to Eugene Young

35:39.110 --> 35:41.210
as deeply honorable,

35:41.210 --> 35:44.080
dignified,

35:44.080 --> 35:47.210
a hero.

35:47.210 --> 35:49.130
I second that.

35:54.070 --> 35:55.140
So do you, Sharon.

35:59.120 --> 36:02.030
There is nobody--

36:02.030 --> 36:03.170
nobody who's
walked through these doors

36:03.170 --> 36:05.230
with more honor,

36:05.230 --> 36:10.090
more dignity and morality,

36:10.090 --> 36:13.070
than the man sitting over there.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.190
- If you recant,
I promise,

36:27.190 --> 36:29.090
there will be
no perjury charges.

36:29.090 --> 36:30.230
- Why are you doing this?

36:30.230 --> 36:31.230
- Lynnette,
I'm just saying,

36:31.230 --> 36:33.200
if you did make this up--

36:33.200 --> 36:36.100
- It's bad enough
the defense attorney attacks me.

36:36.100 --> 36:39.190
Now the DA goes after me too?

36:39.190 --> 36:42.060
He carjacked me.

36:42.060 --> 36:44.140
He did.

36:48.230 --> 36:50.230
- Randy Strunk, well,
he's got to be

36:50.230 --> 36:52.130
the luckiest man in the world.

36:52.130 --> 36:55.070
He meets a very
attractive woman who,

36:55.070 --> 36:57.170
even though she's
a complete stranger,

36:57.170 --> 36:59.170
just can't help herself

36:59.170 --> 37:03.000
and agrees to fool around
with him in her car.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
Then, well, she generously
gifts him with her car.

37:08.100 --> 37:11.030
That happens every day,
doesn't it?

37:11.030 --> 37:14.040
Randy isn't lucky,
ladies and gentlemen.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.230
He's just careful.

37:16.230 --> 37:18.190
He chose his victim.

37:18.190 --> 37:20.120
He chose the time.

37:20.120 --> 37:24.100
He chose a location where
there would be no eyewitnesses.

37:24.100 --> 37:27.190
Randy chose every single detail
of the attack

37:27.190 --> 37:29.170
to work to his advantage,

37:29.170 --> 37:31.200
and after he got caught,

37:31.200 --> 37:35.000
he, along with his attorney,

37:35.000 --> 37:38.220
chose the strategy
of putting the victim on trial.

37:40.120 --> 37:44.000
He said, she said
equals reasonable doubt.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.090
Go ahead,
put him back out there.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.170
Just don't forget
to lock your car doors.

37:51.200 --> 37:55.030
- My definition
of the luckiest man in the world

37:55.030 --> 37:57.080
wouldn't be an innocent man
convicted for a crime

37:57.080 --> 37:58.180
he didn't do.

37:58.180 --> 38:00.090
Here's a flash.

38:00.090 --> 38:02.060
Sometimes the defendant

38:02.060 --> 38:06.080
actually is
the victim of false charges.

38:06.080 --> 38:10.090
Maybe she thought
he stood her up or duped her,

38:10.090 --> 38:14.110
or maybe wasn't really
coming back with her car.

38:14.110 --> 38:16.040
I don't know
what was in her mind

38:16.040 --> 38:19.080
when she told her father
what happened,

38:19.080 --> 38:21.170
but she wasn't carjacked.

38:21.170 --> 38:23.080
No bruises.

38:23.080 --> 38:27.060
No physical signs
of anything violent.

38:28.170 --> 38:31.190
She wasn't carjacked.

38:31.190 --> 38:34.100
This case reminds me
of a question

38:34.100 --> 38:36.000
we used to have
on tests in school

38:36.000 --> 38:37.230
when I was growing up.

38:37.230 --> 38:42.050
Orange, apple, pear, hammer.

38:42.050 --> 38:45.100
Which one doesn't fit?

38:45.100 --> 38:48.110
Here, according to
Lynnette Hayes,

38:48.110 --> 38:49.210
we have an attacker
with a knife

38:49.210 --> 38:51.110
who took her car,

38:51.110 --> 38:54.040
who also happens to know
about her past relationship

38:54.040 --> 38:57.080
with an ex-boyfriend,
among other things.

38:57.080 --> 38:59.040
These are things
you tell someone

38:59.040 --> 39:02.100
you have a personal
relationship with,

39:02.100 --> 39:07.080
however brief,
not an attacker.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.220
Something doesn't fit.

39:18.080 --> 39:21.030
- I'm sorry.
- You tried.

39:21.030 --> 39:25.030
Should I appeal?

39:25.030 --> 39:26.160
- Sit.

39:30.020 --> 39:32.000
We could appeal,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.120
but I don't think we'd win.

39:34.120 --> 39:37.030
You're not in what we call
a suspect class,

39:37.030 --> 39:39.120
and there's no special
protection for people with--

39:39.120 --> 39:41.020
- Funny faces.

39:44.110 --> 39:45.210
So you're not recommending

39:45.210 --> 39:47.210
that we keep going
with this case?

39:49.120 --> 39:50.140
- No.

39:54.040 --> 39:57.180
- Well, thank you for your time,
Ms. Washington.

39:59.200 --> 40:02.140
- I wish I could have been
more help.

40:02.140 --> 40:05.140
- Well, I appreciate
you not laughing, anyway.

40:05.140 --> 40:08.150
Good day.

40:08.150 --> 40:10.040
- Good-bye, Mr. Pyle.

40:21.110 --> 40:23.070
- Between
all the back and forth,

40:23.070 --> 40:24.190
the one piece of evidence

40:24.190 --> 40:28.190
that stands out most
is that you didn't try.

40:28.190 --> 40:31.000
The boy was arrested.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.160
Court papers were filed.

40:32.160 --> 40:34.100
The fact that you didn't
first try,

40:34.100 --> 40:36.140
Ms. Young,
to work something out,

40:36.140 --> 40:39.140
that tells me that you were
leading with fear and anger,

40:39.140 --> 40:41.180
not necessarily
Kendall's interests.

40:41.180 --> 40:43.130
- That isn't true.

40:43.130 --> 40:45.060
- Well, I'm not satisfied

40:45.060 --> 40:47.200
that you've exhausted
every possible remedy.

40:47.200 --> 40:51.020
Taking away a boy's father,
that's severe enough

40:51.020 --> 40:54.080
not to be
the first course of action.

40:54.080 --> 40:57.120
So I'm ordering you both
to try again.

40:57.120 --> 41:00.110
If you fail, try again.

41:00.110 --> 41:03.040
Then, maybe, come to me.

41:03.040 --> 41:06.190
Mr. Young, I am tempted
to restrain your son

41:06.190 --> 41:09.180
from coming to your office,
but I'm not there yet.

41:09.180 --> 41:11.140
We seem to have
two intelligent

41:11.140 --> 41:13.110
and loving parents here,

41:13.110 --> 41:17.040
so let's put some of that
intelligence and love to work.

41:17.040 --> 41:20.040
For God's sake,
this is not about you.

41:20.040 --> 41:23.200
This is about your son.
