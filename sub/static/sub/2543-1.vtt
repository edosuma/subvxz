00:55.960 --> 01:00.440
We've only just begun

01:02.160 --> 01:05.720
Before the rising sun

01:08.200 --> 01:11.400
We've only just begun

01:11.440 --> 01:14.160
Day by day

01:14.200 --> 01:16.520
Together

01:17.840 --> 01:19.680
Oh, and together

01:19.720 --> 01:21.160
Just the two of us

01:42.000 --> 01:43.120
What is that?

01:49.120 --> 01:50.480
Oh, come on!

01:59.560 --> 02:01.480
Shut up!

02:25.280 --> 02:26.880
Kiss!

02:26.920 --> 02:29.000
The devil's music.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.680
You say you wanna go for a spin

02:34.720 --> 02:37.920
The party's just begun,
we'll let you in

02:37.960 --> 02:40.000
You drive us wild

02:40.200 --> 02:42.360
We'll drive you crazy

02:44.800 --> 02:46.200
You keep on shouting

02:48.320 --> 02:50.080
I can't fucking hear you!

02:51.400 --> 02:55.640
I wanna rock and roll all night

02:56.960 --> 02:58.440
And party every day

03:14.160 --> 03:15.440
You keep on shouting

03:16.880 --> 03:18.280
What?

03:18.320 --> 03:20.120
Give it to me, baby!

03:20.160 --> 03:24.480
I wanna rock and roll all night

03:24.520 --> 03:25.840
Let's party

03:25.840 --> 03:27.440
And party every day

03:27.480 --> 03:29.360
I wanna rock

03:29.360 --> 03:31.080
I wanna rock until I die

03:50.200 --> 03:52.840
Thank you, Cleveland!

03:52.840 --> 03:54.240
You've been great...

03:54.320 --> 03:57.840
but after three and a half hours
of kick-ass rock and roll...

03:57.880 --> 03:59.880
and seven encores
on top of that...

03:59.920 --> 04:02.840
I'm sorry to say we gotta
get back to our hotel rooms...

04:02.880 --> 04:05.640
and fuck some groupies, so...

04:09.600 --> 04:11.480
What are you doing, man?

04:11.520 --> 04:13.360
Fuckin' asshole, man.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.720
That's my bass.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.560
Just one more day of school
to get through, girls...

04:17.600 --> 04:18.680
before tomorrow night.

04:18.720 --> 04:23.920
Come on, all Detroit, Michigan,
you wanted the best!

04:23.920 --> 04:25.840
You got the best!

04:25.840 --> 04:28.720
The hottest band in the world!

04:28.720 --> 04:30.279
Kiss!

04:36.880 --> 04:38.840
Who is it?

04:38.880 --> 04:41.280
Shit, man!
It's Jam's mom.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.400
What?
It's my mom?

04:43.440 --> 04:44.600
Cover this shit up.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.360
Spray something.
It smells like dope.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.160
Just like Jam's mom
to ruin the fucking party.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.320
It smells in here, man.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.440
Jeremiah!

04:56.480 --> 04:58.440
You get out here this instant!

04:59.520 --> 05:00.600
Hi, Mom.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.320
Now!

05:03.280 --> 05:04.360
What's up?

05:04.400 --> 05:06.480
The devil's body count,
that's what's up.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.120
Don't you know what
"KlSS" stands for?

05:09.160 --> 05:11.680
Knights In Satan's Service.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.360
-Where is Karen Carpenter?
-How would I know?

05:13.400 --> 05:16.840
-You have Donny and Marie, too?
-Why would l?

05:18.960 --> 05:21.640
I had a nightmare that bullshit
like this might happen.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.760
If he misses Peter Criss'
drum solo...

05:23.800 --> 05:25.840
he won't be able to continue
with his life.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.800
Lex, quit jinxing us, man.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Nobody's missing that concert
tomorrow night.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.600
They're larger-than-life
space-age comic-book heroes...

06:12.600 --> 06:15.480
the most sensational phenomenon
of the past decade.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.600
Their fans are fanatical.

06:16.640 --> 06:20.040
Each fan has a favorite,
each one a fantasy.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.120
The rock-and-roll band Kiss
is in town.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.600
For some people, that spells
trouble with a capital "T".

06:46.880 --> 06:50.560
I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.440
Kiss is hotter than hell!

06:52.480 --> 06:54.320
The protesters
are mainly religious groups.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.280
Satan worship and drugs
among our kids.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.640
Each 12 1/2-inch figure
sold separately.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.440
-Jam.
-Hawk.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.760
Listen. We're in a bit
of a quandary right now.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.520
-They're fucking gone!
-What's gone?

07:59.560 --> 08:02.360
What do you think?
The Kiss tickets!

08:02.400 --> 08:03.440
Gone?

08:03.480 --> 08:06.600
-Please tell me you have them.
-Why would I have them?

08:06.640 --> 08:07.760
I don't know, man.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.120
Check whatever you were wearing
last night.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.520
Now, man!

08:20.680 --> 08:22.040
I got 'em.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.760
He's got 'em.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.960
I must have taken Trip's jacket
by mistake.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.600
I'm really sorry about that.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.400
Don't be such a wuss, Jam.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.960
Are you grounded?

08:31.160 --> 08:35.159
Yeah, but has that ever
stopped me before?

08:35.200 --> 08:37.039
See you guys at school.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.880
Poor Jam, man.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.799
Imagine having to stash
your Kiss records...

08:41.840 --> 08:44.039
in Carly Simon album covers.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.760
How shitty is that?

08:45.800 --> 08:46.920
No question.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.640
Mrs. Bruce is a psycho bitch
from hell.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.240
You're one to talk, Lex.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.720
Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.760
Just because she's
a female gynecologist...

08:54.840 --> 08:56.240
that doesn't mean
she's a lesbian.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.720
Even if she was...

08:57.760 --> 09:00.480
at least my mom didn't
give birth to me while on LSD.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.960
Shrooms!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Will you guys
quit the mom bashing?

09:04.040 --> 09:07.360
Lex's mom is cool because she
lets us spend the night...

09:07.600 --> 09:09.080
and if it wasn't
for your mom, Trip...

09:09.120 --> 09:12.000
we wouldn't have smoked
that fine Panama Red last night.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.720
So leave the women
who gave you life out of it.

09:14.760 --> 09:15.960
They're both cool.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.240
Let's go.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.600
-Trip, you asshole!
-What?

09:23.640 --> 09:26.320
You spilled the bong water
all over the bed.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.840
Stupid...

09:28.960 --> 09:30.040
Come on.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.000
Jeremiah, it's time to go.
Get--

09:36.160 --> 09:37.840
What are you doing?

09:37.880 --> 09:40.360
Just, uh, whew!

09:40.360 --> 09:41.760
Getting a little sunshine.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.440
You're gonna be late
if you don't change soon.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.720
Change?

09:46.760 --> 09:49.120
What's wrong with the clothes
I wore last night?

09:49.160 --> 09:51.520
It's dirty laundry,
for one thing.

09:51.560 --> 09:54.640
And you still haven't tried on
the clothes I bought you.

09:54.680 --> 09:58.120
You're skating on thin ice,
so I wouldn't push my luck.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.600
Get out of those rags.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.920
Mom, it's--

10:00.960 --> 10:02.960
And, besides,
those jeans are so tight...

10:03.000 --> 10:05.200
I can see your penis.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.360
Excuse me.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.800
This jacket,
it stinks of B.O.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.920
It's enough
to make a person sick.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.080
Now, remember.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.440
I have my church meeting...

10:15.480 --> 10:18.320
so you'll be on
the honor system tonight.

10:18.360 --> 10:21.040
I'll be home
a little after one.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.480
And if you've been partying...

10:22.520 --> 10:25.000
or playing
that satanic Kiss music...

10:27.440 --> 10:29.840
need I remind you
of the consequences?

10:32.120 --> 10:34.440
Grounded for the rest
of the year?

10:34.480 --> 10:36.520
You are a smart boy.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.720
Put these on
before they go out of style.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.600
Come on, take it.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.360
Man, school.
What a fuckin' waste of time.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.160
I wish someone would tell
these chicks that disco's dead!

11:03.200 --> 11:06.120
Don't stare too long, boys.
You'll go blind.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.280
Yeah, right.

11:08.760 --> 11:12.680
Stellas. I hate Stellas
almost as much as I hate dogs.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.240
Yeah, man. Same species
when you think about it.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.880
Shit, man.
That geek looks like Jam.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.880
That geek is Jam.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.560
Hey, dork!

11:35.759 --> 11:37.480
Who did your wardrobe?

11:37.520 --> 11:40.400
Tad the Preppie
Sailboat Captain?

11:40.440 --> 11:43.400
My mom had me over a barrel,
all right?

11:43.439 --> 11:46.160
After last night,
I had to let her dress me.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.279
It's a give-and-take
relationship.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.000
She gives you shit,
and you take it.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.760
Hey, Jam,
hand over the tickets.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.560
Tickets?

11:52.600 --> 11:54.000
What?

11:54.040 --> 11:57.080
There's a, uh...
Iittle, little problem.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.480
They're still at my house
in Trip's jacket.

11:59.520 --> 12:00.960
What are you talking about?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.280
She was standing over me
when I was changing.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.760
You are so pathetic.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.040
That's some sick shit
right there, man.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.320
Does she comb your ass hair
for you, too?

12:09.360 --> 12:11.000
If she even smells
those tickets...

12:11.040 --> 12:12.240
she'll destroy 'em...

12:12.280 --> 12:14.880
and we miss Kiss
for the third year in a row.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.640
It's gonna be OK.
Don't worry.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.720
They're at my house.
They're perfectly safe.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.440
We'll go there after school
and pick them up.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.600
My mom's not even
gonna be there.

12:22.640 --> 12:26.520
Hours from now we're actually
gonna be seeing Kiss.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.480
We'll just double-time it
to your house...

12:28.520 --> 12:29.600
grab the tickets...

12:29.640 --> 12:31.400
then head
to the train station...

12:31.440 --> 12:35.800
for the three forty-five
to Detroit Rock City!

12:35.839 --> 12:37.200
God!

12:37.200 --> 12:40.000
Well, as they say
in the tampon biz...

12:40.040 --> 12:41.720
see you next period.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.880
Jerk.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.280
I'm sorry.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.920
It's not a problem.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.520
Thanks.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.600
Fine.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.680
Hey, Beth.

13:27.880 --> 13:28.960
I'm so sorry.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.040
Mr. Bruce, Miss Bumsteen,
is there a problem?

13:32.080 --> 13:34.240
Uh, no, there...

13:34.280 --> 13:36.240
there's no problem.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.680
I'm so sorry.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.080
Don't worry about it.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.040
I wanted to tell you something.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.600
What?

13:50.640 --> 13:56.080
I know we don't know each other
that well or anything, but...

13:56.280 --> 13:57.600
But what?

14:00.520 --> 14:05.040
Today is gonna be the last time
I can--

14:05.080 --> 14:07.440
I'm mov--

14:07.480 --> 14:09.240
Jeremiah Bruce,
please come to the office.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.000
Jeremiah Bruce,
come to the office immediately.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.720
Give me that microphone!

14:13.760 --> 14:16.040
Jeremiah Bruce!
This is your mother!

14:16.040 --> 14:19.520
You are in big trouble,
young man.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.320
What I found in the pocket of
that stinky jacket of yours...

14:22.360 --> 14:24.240
has me more than livid.

14:24.240 --> 14:27.080
You get your little fanny
out of that seat...

14:27.120 --> 14:29.960
and you meet me
in the front office.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.440
How dare you do this!

14:31.480 --> 14:34.000
How dare you humiliate me
after I work so hard for you!

14:34.040 --> 14:36.040
You take my hard-earned money...

14:36.080 --> 14:39.559
and you and your idiot friends
spend it...

14:39.600 --> 14:41.440
on Kiss tickets?!

15:06.720 --> 15:08.040
Sit!

15:10.320 --> 15:11.600
You don't understand.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.320
Oh, I understand perfectly.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.920
And so will
Father Philip McNulty.

15:15.960 --> 15:19.400
You're sending me
to boarding school?

15:19.440 --> 15:20.840
What else can I do?

15:20.880 --> 15:24.160
Records, magazines,
comic books, that's one thing...

15:24.200 --> 15:26.440
but tickets.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.760
Do you realize what this means?

15:28.800 --> 15:31.600
You are no longer content merely
hearing their awful music...

15:31.600 --> 15:33.520
and looking at photos
of their horrific faces.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.440
Now you want to see the devil
in the flesh!

15:35.480 --> 15:38.360
You want to reach out
and touch pure evil.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.160
And in Detroit, no less.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.200
It's been a long time coming...

16:22.240 --> 16:26.160
but you are finally going to get
the discipline you deserve.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.240
But, Mom--

16:27.280 --> 16:28.400
Shut up!

16:41.200 --> 16:42.280
I knew it.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.239
We're completely fucked.

16:44.239 --> 16:46.960
For once, Lex is right.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.520
Can't get any worse from here.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.919
I hope you rodents
have hall passes.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.720
Fuck, it's Elvis!

16:54.880 --> 16:59.640
Could that be three detentions
I smell?

16:59.680 --> 17:02.760
Second floor, girls bathroom.
He'll never find us there.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.960
Fuck! Son of a bitch, man!

17:14.000 --> 17:15.239
Take it easy, man.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.680
This is the girls crapper,
remember?

17:16.720 --> 17:17.880
Wake up, Lex!

17:17.920 --> 17:21.480
We just watched Jam's mom
torch ourfucking Kiss tickets!

17:21.520 --> 17:23.440
Not REO Speedwagon...

17:23.480 --> 17:25.960
not Journey,
not the Bay City Rollers.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.440
Kiss, man!

17:27.480 --> 17:30.200
If you know a better reason
to trash a girls bathroom...

17:30.240 --> 17:32.160
I'd sure like to hear it.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.360
What the fuck are you doing?

17:34.400 --> 17:36.840
-This is school.
-So what?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.160
I think we're clear, dudes.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.520
Let's go.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.040
-Shit. Girls, girls.
-Shit.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.680
Sharon Van Hoft.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.640
I've had the hots for her
since second grade.

18:28.160 --> 18:31.200
Man, I've never heard a girl
blow ass before.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.040
Get the fuck out!

18:45.040 --> 18:46.480
Sorry.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.600
God forbid someday
you have a son like you.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.560
A boy who lies
through his teeth...

19:07.600 --> 19:09.320
buys demonic records...

19:09.359 --> 19:11.200
and smokes the dope.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.160
Sorry. Sorry.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.120
Anyone upfor an enema?

19:55.320 --> 19:56.520
Shit, man.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.120
Maybe some music
will cheer us up.

20:02.161 --> 20:05.080
Simple Simon
on the rock of Detroit...

20:05.120 --> 20:07.200
home of the biggest
Kiss giveaway...

20:07.239 --> 20:08.960
in the history of the universe!

20:09.000 --> 20:10.760
I got four front-row tickets...

20:10.800 --> 20:12.800
along with four
backstage passes...

20:12.840 --> 20:15.800
to the concert tonight
at Cobo Hall...

20:15.840 --> 20:19.440
and I'm giving 'em
to the 106th caller...

20:19.480 --> 20:22.560
who can tell me the real names
of each Kiss band member.

20:22.599 --> 20:23.840
Oh, shit.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.600
This is horse shit.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.680
It's too bad we're stuck
in this prison.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.680
I got it.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.280
Mr. Verudi,
get back to your bench.

20:43.320 --> 20:46.320
I gotta take a leak
like you would not believe.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.760
Put a clothespin on it
till the end of class.

20:48.800 --> 20:49.880
But, Mr. J...

20:49.920 --> 20:52.640
ever since my doctor
put me on these salt pills--

20:52.680 --> 20:54.200
Salt pills?

20:54.240 --> 20:56.360
Don't insult my intelligence.

20:56.400 --> 21:00.720
Oh, man,
I'm taking a leak in my pants.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.040
Get the hell out of here.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.480
You disgust me.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.560
I need to be connected
to the WURP contest line.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.360
Now, lady, come on!

21:30.920 --> 21:32.840
Oh, yeah, man!

21:35.720 --> 21:36.920
I won!

21:36.960 --> 21:40.800
We! We won!

21:40.880 --> 21:43.360
We're going to Detroit!

21:49.400 --> 21:53.040
This is the greatest thing that
ever happened to me in school.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.319
Not only are we on
for Kiss in Detroit...

21:55.360 --> 21:58.960
but we're gonna be sitting
front row, center, man.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.040
Guys, our band Mystery
is a quartet, right?

22:02.080 --> 22:04.200
We can't go on the road
without our drummer.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.760
Jam's mom said something about
taking him to St. Bernard's.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.280
I say we bust him
the hell out of there.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.800
St. Bernard's
is in the next county.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.960
Your mom's car
has a CB, radar detector...

22:15.000 --> 22:16.040
cruise control, check.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.520
We're not stealing
my mom's car, OK?

22:18.560 --> 22:20.200
Damn right, we are, man.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.920
One ding on that Volvo...

22:21.960 --> 22:24.320
and I'm fucked when my mom
gets back from Cincinnati.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.600
She won't even know
we touched it.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.120
If one thing happens to the car,
I'm blaming you.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.640
I'm gonna say you drugged me.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.920
I say we leave.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.640
Hold on.
We're ditching school?

22:33.680 --> 22:35.360
About time if you ask me.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.400
I'm just going
through the motions...

22:37.440 --> 22:39.320
till I'm old enough
to drop out anyway.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.000
Shit.
Guys, Elvis alert.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.760
I notice the trays
match your outfits.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.440
Did you plan that?

22:49.240 --> 22:50.720
Excuse me, ladies.

22:51.520 --> 22:53.479
He stinks!

23:22.800 --> 23:24.360
I'm responsible for that!

23:59.560 --> 24:01.160
Pray hard, Jeremiah.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.120
God loves you.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.560
That he does.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.640
God bless you,
Father McNulty.

24:15.560 --> 24:19.040
If you think that recklessness
and disobedience...

24:19.080 --> 24:20.280
can get you expelled...

24:20.320 --> 24:21.680
think again.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.200
St. Bernard's may punish you...

24:24.240 --> 24:26.520
even for the slightest
digression, but...

24:26.560 --> 24:29.560
it'll never cast you out,
even for the largest.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.400
So, here you are, Jeremiah.

24:32.440 --> 24:34.440
Here to stay.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.200
Damn, man, come on.
Let's go bust him out.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.720
No, man.
We can't just waltz in there.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.599
We've gotta figure out a plan.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.880
The eagle's landed,
you guys.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.760
You kids know where
Philip McNutly's office is?

25:31.640 --> 25:32.920
You ordered a pizza?

25:32.960 --> 25:35.560
-What's the damage, young man?
-Ten even.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.160
If he offers you a slice,
you're not hungry.

25:47.280 --> 25:51.280
Ten dollars, and I'm donating
your tip to the church.

25:51.320 --> 25:52.360
The Lord thanks you.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.800
Tell the big guy
not to mention it.

25:54.840 --> 25:56.520
I am famished.

25:56.560 --> 25:59.760
Well, hope you brought a lunch
for yourself.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.240
No, but I'm not hungry anyway.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.160
Oh, it finally speaks.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.320
There's one barrier
we've broken through.

26:14.760 --> 26:19.040
Your coming here reminds me
of the Prodigal Son.

26:19.080 --> 26:22.600
Once, there was a man,
and he had two sons.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.640
They both grew up on the farm
with him.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.240
One day--

26:45.640 --> 26:49.320
That was a very stale mushroom.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.760
Well...

26:50.800 --> 26:52.240
where was l?

26:52.240 --> 26:54.640
Man, come on,
this is such a lousy view.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.360
How are we supposed to know
when he's lit?

26:57.400 --> 27:00.280
It usually takes ten minutes
to half an hour.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.480
All depends, you know?

27:06.800 --> 27:08.040
He's lit.

27:14.320 --> 27:17.600
I've been telling that sermon
for years.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.680
This is the first time
I've realized...

27:19.719 --> 27:23.480
it's the work of some
comedy mastermind.

27:23.520 --> 27:28.160
The Prodigal Son is a barrel
of fuckin' monkeys.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.320
Wait, wait!

27:29.360 --> 27:31.239
You kids can't go in there.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.520
No, it's OK. We're old buds
of Father McNulty's.

27:34.560 --> 27:35.880
How's it hangin', padre?

27:35.920 --> 27:39.400
I just heard you talking
through my nose.

27:39.440 --> 27:43.080
Is it possible
my nose has eardrums?

27:43.120 --> 27:44.600
Nosedrums.

27:45.680 --> 27:48.360
We're here to take
ourfriend Jam...

27:48.400 --> 27:52.640
to the big satanic Kiss concert
tonight if that's OK with you.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.440
Satan? Satan?

27:54.480 --> 27:55.560
Santa.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.240
They're the same letters.
They're the same guy.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.840
It's the same friggin' guy.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.320
What the hell are you doing,
Sister Gonorrhea?

28:05.360 --> 28:07.080
Waitin' for a bus?

28:31.240 --> 28:34.080
You'll still get rowdy
with the girls and boys

28:34.120 --> 28:38.120
'Cause it's time
for you to take a stand

28:38.160 --> 28:39.880
Yeah, whoo

28:39.920 --> 28:42.200
Shout it, shout it

28:42.240 --> 28:45.000
Shout it out loud

28:45.040 --> 28:46.800
You've got to have a party

28:46.840 --> 28:49.640
Shout it, shout it

28:49.680 --> 28:51.160
Shout it out loud

28:52.640 --> 28:54.160
Whoa, dudes, man.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.320
I just had
the killerest vision, man.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.840
Imagine Mystery...

28:58.880 --> 29:01.640
opening up for Kiss, man.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.240
Oh, that'd be fucking it.

29:03.280 --> 29:06.560
Yeah, man.
It could happen, man.

29:06.600 --> 29:10.600
You know, in '73, Kiss was
opening for Blue Oyster Cult.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.840
One year later to the day,
man...

29:12.880 --> 29:15.560
Blue Oyster Cult
was opening for Kiss.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.040
We're not opening for anybody...

29:17.080 --> 29:19.560
until our lead singer
gets over his stage fright.

29:19.599 --> 29:21.040
God, man.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.080
I don't have fucking
stage fright, Lex.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.079
Then why'd you pass out
on stage at Bing's party...

29:25.120 --> 29:26.320
before the first
fucking song?

29:26.360 --> 29:28.800
That was one show, man.

29:28.840 --> 29:31.720
That was our only show, and you
dropped like a dead deer on us.

29:31.720 --> 29:32.840
Shut up.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.800
I'm solid gold

29:37.840 --> 29:39.520
I got the goods

29:39.560 --> 29:43.120
They stare when I walk
through the neighborhood

29:43.160 --> 29:45.080
I'm makin' it

29:45.120 --> 29:48.920
I got the chance,
I'm takin' it

29:48.960 --> 29:50.560
No more, no more

29:50.599 --> 29:52.480
Fakin' it

29:52.560 --> 29:53.680
This time in life

29:53.720 --> 29:55.880
I'm takin' it

29:55.920 --> 29:57.680
Woo woo woo

29:57.719 --> 29:59.320
Makin' it

30:00.000 --> 30:01.760
Gimme this pizza.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.240
It's the last piece.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.200
It's mine, all right?

30:08.440 --> 30:11.360
Fuck, man. Only a car full
of Stellas and Guidos...

30:11.400 --> 30:13.960
would ride your ass
on a two-lane highway and honk.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.880
Oh, man.

30:15.920 --> 30:19.440
Listen, everyone here

30:19.480 --> 30:20.880
This coming year's gonna

30:20.920 --> 30:22.440
Be my year

30:22.480 --> 30:24.160
I'm as bad as they come

30:24.199 --> 30:25.760
Number two to no one

30:25.800 --> 30:27.560
I got looks, I got brains

30:27.600 --> 30:30.040
And I'm breaking these chains

30:30.080 --> 30:32.080
Throw that shit out
before it stains the up--

30:32.120 --> 30:34.680
Throw it out of the car,
you asshole!

30:34.720 --> 30:36.040
Come on, man!

30:37.560 --> 30:39.240
I'm makin' it

30:43.280 --> 30:45.160
Oh, fuck, man.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.600
Kenny, you asshole,
you just killed a bird.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.680
That's no bird.

30:48.720 --> 30:51.560
That's a hunk of fuckin' cheese,
Kenny.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.360
A hunk of fuckin' cheese?

30:53.400 --> 30:55.879
We just pissed off
the lncredible Hulk...

30:55.920 --> 30:58.800
his idiot half brother,
and two circus clowns.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.000
I'm gonna fuckin' kill
these bastards.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.920
Pull the fuckin' car over!

31:08.359 --> 31:09.800
I'm gonna fuckin'--
Pull over!

31:09.840 --> 31:10.920
No way, man.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.520
You're dead!

31:12.560 --> 31:14.119
Suck my cock!

31:14.160 --> 31:15.960
You should pull over
and apologize.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.880
This motherfucker's dead!

31:21.320 --> 31:23.000
The paint!

31:24.200 --> 31:25.680
Fuck!

31:26.960 --> 31:28.040
Pull over!

31:41.920 --> 31:44.080
Out of the car.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.200
Fuck.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.960
Oh, shit!
God--

31:53.520 --> 31:56.400
Oh, God!
Aah, shit!

31:57.680 --> 31:59.799
That's not funny, Kenny.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.080
Oh, God!

32:05.520 --> 32:07.720
Oh, that's not very nice, man.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.920
You are a complete asshole,
Kenny.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.960
Not the fag music.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.680
Get out of the way.

32:17.720 --> 32:19.520
Cut it with the macho crap
already.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.600
This is about pizza, man.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.640
Can we try and leave Kiss
out of it?

32:25.680 --> 32:29.800
What, a bunch of guys
who make bad music...

32:29.839 --> 32:31.120
dress like freaks...

32:31.160 --> 32:33.280
and wear more makeup
than all my sisters combined?

32:33.320 --> 32:36.560
No. These assholes
gotta be stopped.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.840
That's it.
I'm leaving.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.520
Christine.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.400
Jesus.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.240
You googats in the head
or something?

32:49.280 --> 32:51.160
We're on the side of
the freakin' highway.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.240
Fuck her.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.880
Kool and the Gang,
that's music.

32:55.920 --> 32:57.000
But this?

32:57.040 --> 32:58.680
This is crap.

32:58.720 --> 32:59.800
That's crap.

33:09.400 --> 33:10.480
All right, fag-mo.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.919
Have you learned
your lesson yet, puke?

33:12.960 --> 33:14.400
Well...

33:14.480 --> 33:19.040
if the lesson is that
you're a dick with ears...

33:19.079 --> 33:20.319
and a really bad haircut...

33:20.360 --> 33:22.960
I'd say yeah,
I learned my lesson.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.840
-Break his fucking legs, Kenny.
-Fuckin'--

33:56.720 --> 33:59.560
Come on,
we can talk about this, right?

33:59.600 --> 34:02.520
You know,
maybe reason a little bit.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.679
When these guys wake up,
they're gonna look for you.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.040
You best hope
they don't find you...

34:12.080 --> 34:14.639
'cause if they do,
they're gonna kick your asses.

34:14.679 --> 34:17.679
Oh, yeah, Stella.
And we'll deserve it, too.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.679
But you know what I'm gonna do?

34:19.719 --> 34:22.440
I'm gonna make it
really worth their while.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.199
Oh, God!

34:37.000 --> 34:38.960
Thanks for letting us
use your makeup supply.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.440
You must have the entire
Revlon factory in your purse...

34:41.480 --> 34:43.561
you greasy disco ball.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.960
Very funny.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.080
I hope you fuckin'
choke to death and die...

34:47.120 --> 34:48.520
you loser-ass motherfuckers!

34:48.560 --> 34:49.800
Disco sucks!

34:49.840 --> 34:51.440
Fuck you!

34:51.639 --> 34:53.800
Fuck! Fuck!

34:55.199 --> 34:57.400
They put the fag makeup on you.

34:57.440 --> 34:58.800
They put the fag makeup on?

34:58.840 --> 35:00.719
The fuckin' fag makeup's on you.

35:02.800 --> 35:06.040
Oh, no.
I got fag makeup on me.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.240
Hey, look.
It's that girl.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.920
Man, that's no girl.
That's a Stella.

35:22.959 --> 35:25.240
Yeah, well,
Stella or no Stella...

35:25.280 --> 35:27.200
we should pull over
and help her out.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.320
Fuckin' inbred oaf.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.280
Kenny.
Fuck you.

35:32.320 --> 35:33.960
Fuckin' kick your ass.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.120
Man, what the hell
is wrong with you?

35:36.160 --> 35:38.159
You got a thing for that thing?

35:38.200 --> 35:41.039
It's a teenage girl walking
along the side of the highway.

35:41.039 --> 35:45.400
They make scary movies
that start out like that.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.840
Hey, but they make
porno movies...

35:47.880 --> 35:49.679
that start out
like that, too, man.

36:09.040 --> 36:12.280
Oh, great. Just hitched a ride
with a bunch of potheads.

36:12.280 --> 36:14.720
Look, I'm trying to hook up
with some people...

36:14.760 --> 36:17.440
at this funky place in Detroit
called Disco lnferno.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.400
You mind dropping me there?

36:19.440 --> 36:21.000
What's it worth to you?

36:21.040 --> 36:23.080
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

36:23.120 --> 36:25.440
It doesn't mean anything.
Don't pay attention to him.

36:25.479 --> 36:27.640
It's more like Disco's lnfernal.

36:27.679 --> 36:29.240
Ooh, you hot baby, you.

36:29.440 --> 36:32.680
You know,
your clothes may say disco...

36:32.720 --> 36:34.801
but your eyes say rock and roll.

36:36.440 --> 36:39.280
Well, your belt buckle
may say rock and roll...

36:39.320 --> 36:43.240
but your breath
says pepperoni, baby.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.400
Are you gonna, like,
suck our dicks, or what?

36:46.440 --> 36:47.720
What?

36:47.760 --> 36:49.840
-That's so fuckin' rude, man.
-Fuck you, Jam.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.880
Stop being a wussy sensitive guy
just to impress her.

36:52.919 --> 36:55.360
She's obviously not
gonna put out, man.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.680
She's a tease, man.

36:57.719 --> 37:00.920
A tease? What the hell did I do
to tease you mongoloids?

37:01.120 --> 37:03.120
You got in the fuckin' car,
didn't you?

37:03.160 --> 37:04.640
How calculating of me
to lead you on like that...

37:04.680 --> 37:06.440
after you offered me a ride
in the middle of nowhere.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.360
Whatever, Stella.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.440
My name's Christine.
Not Stella.

37:10.479 --> 37:13.120
You don't have to be such pigs
'cause I prefer Donna Summer...

37:13.160 --> 37:17.520
or K.C. and the Sunshine Band
or the Village People over Kiss.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.760
Fuckin' Village People.
They're a fag band.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.000
They take it up the coast.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.640
All right, all right, guys.

37:23.680 --> 37:26.160
Thanks, but I can take
care of myself, Germ.

37:27.640 --> 37:28.680
Whatever.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.400
OK, dope burnout, let's get
one thing straight here.

37:31.440 --> 37:34.440
As far as I'm concerned,
good tunes is good tunes.

37:34.640 --> 37:36.720
Disco or rock or polka
or whatever have you...

37:36.760 --> 37:38.520
regardless of the category.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.800
Disco is just easier
to dance to.

37:40.840 --> 37:44.040
You call that Denny Terio,
John Travolta shit dancing?

37:44.240 --> 37:47.160
You know something?
Disco's so fucking big now...

37:47.200 --> 37:50.200
I wouldn't be surprised if Kiss
did a disco song someday.

37:50.240 --> 37:52.280
If it's one thing
Kiss will never do...

37:52.320 --> 37:53.640
it's a bullshit disco song.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.120
No shit, man.

37:55.160 --> 37:59.080
Yeah. Disco blows dogs
for quarters, man.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.360
That's an intelligently
biting remark...

38:00.560 --> 38:01.800
wrought with wit and irony.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.240
If you don't like that one...

38:03.440 --> 38:04.720
maybe you'll think
it's really funny...

38:04.720 --> 38:07.440
when we kick your fuckin' ass
out of the car.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.480
Why don't you put your money
where your mouth is?

38:09.520 --> 38:11.440
Why don't you lick
my hairy crack?

38:11.480 --> 38:14.960
Why don't you bend over?
You're looking right at it.

38:17.160 --> 38:20.040
That last remark
fell about thirty yards away...

38:20.080 --> 38:22.720
from making any sense
whatsoever.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.840
You're right.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.600
Bend over,
you're looking right at it?

38:26.640 --> 38:28.840
What the hell is that
supposed to mean anyway?

38:30.920 --> 38:32.919
Give me a hit off that "J,"
will ya?

38:32.960 --> 38:34.600
That's some kick-ass shit.

39:26.040 --> 39:27.600
Move out of my way!

39:27.640 --> 39:31.080
Lex, thank you for letting us
borrow your mom's car, man.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.400
Man, that weed knocked her
straight on her ass.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.640
She's sleeping
like a baby Stella.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.960
Man, let's lift up her skirt.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.920
-There it is!
-What?

39:39.960 --> 39:43.360
Holy fuck! We made it.
Oh, my God.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.440
Oh, my God!
Thank you!

39:53.040 --> 39:54.120
Man.

39:56.719 --> 39:59.720
I'm going into swarm-o mode.

39:59.760 --> 40:00.880
Oh, shit!

40:07.520 --> 40:09.640
I'm the King of
the Nighttime World!

40:11.399 --> 40:13.080
This is better
than the first time...

40:13.120 --> 40:15.360
I got to finger a chick, man.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.800
It's happening, man!

40:18.840 --> 40:19.880
WURP!

40:19.920 --> 40:21.640
This is so lucky.

40:21.679 --> 40:23.680
We got two hours to spare!

40:23.720 --> 40:26.720
-Check out that parking space.
-Get in there!

40:26.760 --> 40:29.840
Ample time to go to the station
and grab our tickets.

40:29.880 --> 40:32.400
God is smiling down
upon us tonight.

40:32.440 --> 40:36.080
That's weird. I figured
he'd be pissed as hell at me.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.240
Fuck, yeah!

40:43.280 --> 40:44.600
Oh, baby!

40:47.640 --> 40:49.800
This is so awesome, man.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.560
No way, man!

40:51.600 --> 40:53.280
I can't wait!

40:53.320 --> 40:54.840
We're going to Kiss

41:00.040 --> 41:01.360
Let's get out of here, man.

41:02.159 --> 41:04.800
-Simple Simon?
-The one and only.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.880
You kids
have to hurry this up.

41:07.920 --> 41:10.120
I'm due at Cobo Hall
in a half hourfor the warmup.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.479
We're right behind you, Simon.

41:11.520 --> 41:14.720
We want to thank you in advance
for those burly-ass ticks.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.440
Your name isn't Trip, is it?

41:16.480 --> 41:18.320
Oh, no.
My name's Trip.

41:18.360 --> 41:20.320
Remember?
We were talking on the phone?

41:22.200 --> 41:23.560
Go, caller.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.240
Eugene Klein, Stanley Eisen...

41:26.280 --> 41:29.200
Peter Crisscoula,
and Paul Frehley.

41:29.240 --> 41:31.079
You just got yourself
four tickets...

41:31.120 --> 41:32.920
and four backstage passes...

41:34.760 --> 41:36.960
-...at Cobo Hall tonight!
-We won!

41:36.960 --> 41:39.920
Stay on the line so we
can get yourfull name...

41:39.960 --> 41:42.479
Trip? You didn't hang up on me,
did you, Tri--

41:42.520 --> 41:44.480
What kind of total moron...

41:44.520 --> 41:47.080
would hang up
after winning Kiss tickets?

41:47.120 --> 41:50.040
Well, there you have it.
We had no choice.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.440
We gave the tickets
to the next caller.

41:51.480 --> 41:52.960
I'm sorry.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.240
Relax!

42:04.280 --> 42:05.480
Get off of him!

42:18.398 --> 42:19.478
This noise machine...

42:19.519 --> 42:22.638
is more than just a quartet
of lousy musicians.

42:22.679 --> 42:25.918
There's a woman who abuses
her privilege of motherhood.

42:25.918 --> 42:28.678
-What is Kiss backwards?
-Ssik!

42:30.718 --> 42:31.799
Oh, shit!

42:31.838 --> 42:33.679
Guys, where's the Volvo?

42:33.679 --> 42:36.719
It was fucking stolen, man.

42:36.759 --> 42:38.678
Christine stole it.
Sleep, my ass.

42:38.719 --> 42:40.598
The Stella booted
with your mom's wheels.

42:40.598 --> 42:43.039
Son of a bitch, man!
How can this happen?

42:43.078 --> 42:44.438
Why are you laughing?

42:44.479 --> 42:46.078
I'm starting to get real mad.

42:46.119 --> 42:47.479
Jam, you ass!

42:47.519 --> 42:50.039
Why'd you talk us
into picking up this bitch?

42:50.078 --> 42:52.759
I'm sorry, man.
I was trying to be nice.

42:52.799 --> 42:53.919
I'm sick of your nice shit!

42:53.919 --> 42:56.279
Drummers are supposed
to have some fucking balls.

42:56.319 --> 42:58.718
Fuck you, man.
I was being conscientious.

42:58.759 --> 43:01.279
I didn't think she was
going to steal his mom's car.

43:01.318 --> 43:03.918
Jam, just shut your
faggotty-ass mouth, OK?

43:03.959 --> 43:05.319
You're pissing me off.

43:05.359 --> 43:07.239
Now, we came all this way...

43:07.279 --> 43:09.239
we got an hour
and forty-five minutes...

43:09.279 --> 43:12.158
and we got absolutely nothing.

43:12.199 --> 43:16.039
So help me, God,
we are going to that concert.

43:16.079 --> 43:19.119
We must get the cops in
on this Volvo situation.

43:19.158 --> 43:21.559
Lex, this is Detroit.

43:21.599 --> 43:24.799
You think the cops will waste
city dollars on a Swedish car?

43:25.759 --> 43:26.678
You're right.

43:26.719 --> 43:28.599
My mom's got insurance.

43:28.639 --> 43:30.159
Why am I freaking out?

43:30.239 --> 43:32.079
It's cool. She's gonna try
to ground me for a year.

43:32.119 --> 43:33.158
I don't give a shit, man.

43:33.199 --> 43:34.559
Exactly.
Cool, bro.

43:34.599 --> 43:37.279
Oh, shit!
Man, I'm in big trouble!

43:37.279 --> 43:39.839
I'm in big fucking trouble!
The car's gone, man!

43:39.878 --> 43:41.319
Shut the fuck up, man!

43:41.358 --> 43:42.999
We're trying to think!

43:43.039 --> 43:44.719
Wait a second, man.

43:44.759 --> 43:46.718
I know how we can get
the fucking tickets, man.

43:46.799 --> 43:49.719
We beat the fucking shit
out of four little kids.

43:49.759 --> 43:51.678
Like,
take their fuckin' tickets.

43:51.719 --> 43:54.079
Brilliance, Trip.
Sheer fuckin' brilliance.

43:54.118 --> 43:56.119
Why don't you give
Albert Einstein here...

43:56.159 --> 43:58.918
the fuckin' Nobel Prize?!

43:59.919 --> 44:03.159
Look, I think I can
barter with a scalper.

44:03.198 --> 44:05.759
If you guys can think of
a better plan, go for it.

44:05.799 --> 44:08.479
For the next hour and a half,
it's every dude for himself.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.759
We'll reconvene
at that intersection at 8:45.

44:11.799 --> 44:14.399
I'll see you guys later.
Good luck.

44:14.399 --> 44:16.359
I don't know
what the fuck we're doing.

44:18.559 --> 44:21.278
Look around you tonight,
mothers.

44:21.278 --> 44:24.399
Look at all the young faces.

44:24.438 --> 44:27.159
Oh, they smile
and they laugh...

44:27.198 --> 44:29.599
but their eyes
have lost all hope.

44:29.638 --> 44:31.599
This satanic group Kiss...

44:31.639 --> 44:34.399
has stolen their souls!

44:35.079 --> 44:36.319
We--

44:37.759 --> 44:40.119
Shit.

44:46.359 --> 44:48.999
I do not know
how you got here tonight...

44:49.039 --> 44:50.799
and I do not want to know.

44:50.839 --> 44:52.319
All I know is...

44:52.519 --> 44:55.838
you are going to pay dearly
for this one, young man.

45:16.639 --> 45:17.759
Oh, my God.

45:17.759 --> 45:19.679
The mass, Father--
so inspirational.

45:19.679 --> 45:20.759
Father, thank you.

45:20.798 --> 45:21.879
Come again next week.

45:21.918 --> 45:22.959
Father.

45:22.998 --> 45:24.638
It's Jeremiah.

45:24.679 --> 45:26.199
I'm desperate.

45:26.239 --> 45:28.319
My son was about to defy God...

45:28.358 --> 45:30.359
by going to that
blasphemous Kiss concert.

45:30.399 --> 45:33.279
In that case,
come right in.

45:33.279 --> 45:36.079
He and his mom
just went into that church.

45:36.119 --> 45:38.239
Can I go and say
good-bye to him?

45:38.279 --> 45:42.399
Beth, I am not gonna let you
wander the streets after dark.

45:42.439 --> 45:45.959
I'm not going to wander.
I'm just going over there.

45:45.999 --> 45:48.799
Fine. As long as we know
where you are.

45:48.799 --> 45:49.878
Thank you.

45:50.079 --> 45:52.959
Don't be too long.
We need to get back on the road.

45:52.999 --> 45:55.359
-Stuart.
-Just relax.

45:55.359 --> 45:59.279
She's probably got a crush
on the kid or something.

46:06.439 --> 46:07.879
Hey, chief,
need a ticket?

46:07.959 --> 46:11.479
Second row, center,
but it's seventy-five clams.

46:11.519 --> 46:14.199
Aw, man, this is all I got.
Look.

46:15.398 --> 46:17.198
Scare up the extra gravy.

46:17.239 --> 46:18.359
Brother, take it easy.

46:18.399 --> 46:21.718
Where am I supposed to find
that kind of money in an hour?

46:23.358 --> 46:26.199
Well, um...
check it out over there.

46:26.239 --> 46:27.519
There's a contest going on.

46:27.559 --> 46:30.519
You take off your pants,
shake your wee-wee, get $100.

46:30.559 --> 46:34.318
I can't take off my clothes
and dance like that, man.

46:34.359 --> 46:37.039
That's embarrassing, man.

46:37.079 --> 46:38.519
Check it out, man.

46:38.559 --> 46:40.519
The question you
got to ask yourself is...

46:40.559 --> 46:41.998
how badly do you want to see...

46:42.039 --> 46:44.039
the greatest fucking
rock-and-roll show...

46:44.079 --> 46:45.399
on the fucking earth, right?

46:45.438 --> 46:48.279
You're talkin'
Gene and Paul live, y'all.

46:48.318 --> 46:50.839
I'm talkin' about voluptuous
women in the audience.

46:50.879 --> 46:53.999
I'm talkin' big breastesses
in tight vestesses, my friend.

46:54.039 --> 46:56.678
You're talkin' people passin'
around joints in the audience.

46:56.719 --> 46:59.999
You're talkin' about
Detroit Rock City, brother.

47:00.039 --> 47:01.358
Shake your wee-wee.

47:01.399 --> 47:03.398
I got stage fright.

47:04.159 --> 47:06.039
And they're playing
fucking disco over there.

47:06.079 --> 47:08.119
Shit or get off the pot,
rock star.

47:08.159 --> 47:09.359
You want to dance?

47:09.399 --> 47:12.598
Or see Kiss on album covers
for the rest of your life?

47:14.879 --> 47:16.838
Mmm, second row, center,
brother.

47:16.879 --> 47:18.239
Go shake your wee-wee.

47:18.279 --> 47:19.839
You're gonna have that ticket
for me, right?

47:19.878 --> 47:22.478
Oh, yeah, man,
you got my solemn oath...

47:22.519 --> 47:24.719
as a public servant.

47:27.999 --> 47:29.359
Go for it, brother.

47:30.359 --> 47:32.078
All right.

47:32.119 --> 47:33.318
See you around.

47:37.599 --> 47:40.038
Hey, chief,
you need a ticket?

47:40.079 --> 47:42.519
Seventy-five bucks,
second row, center.

47:42.559 --> 47:43.959
I'm gonna beat my ticket...

47:44.199 --> 47:45.799
out of some poor
defenseless chump.

47:45.839 --> 47:47.479
You know what I mean?

47:47.519 --> 47:48.678
Yeah, whatever,
reefer-head.

47:48.719 --> 47:51.039
You fuckin' burnout.

48:20.918 --> 48:22.239
Take it off, honey!

48:36.799 --> 48:38.038
Gimme!

48:40.639 --> 48:41.878
Don't do that.

48:47.239 --> 48:49.799
I need to sign up
for the contest, please.

48:49.838 --> 48:51.999
You're a little scrawny,
but thanks to the concert...

48:51.999 --> 48:53.519
we're low on amateurs.
Name?

48:54.399 --> 48:55.679
Pick a song, Hawk.

48:55.679 --> 48:57.319
You got any Kiss?

48:57.359 --> 48:59.198
Doubtful.
Drink?

48:59.239 --> 49:00.479
Yeah. A man's drink.

49:04.799 --> 49:05.919
Oh, God.

49:08.999 --> 49:10.079
What's this?

49:10.119 --> 49:12.559
You've never seen
a bourbon on the rocks before?

49:14.519 --> 49:15.799
Save your money,
stud muffin.

49:15.839 --> 49:18.679
Lady at the end of the bar
sends her love.

49:27.279 --> 49:30.318
Oh. Shit.

49:32.638 --> 49:33.719
Cheers.

49:40.959 --> 49:42.319
God!

49:43.399 --> 49:45.759
It's gone bad.

50:01.799 --> 50:03.039
Hey, you little twerps.

50:03.238 --> 50:05.919
Give me your Kiss tickets,
or I'll pop yourfaces in.

50:05.919 --> 50:07.719
But we don't have
any Kiss tickets.

50:07.759 --> 50:09.439
Yeah. Kiss sucks!

50:09.479 --> 50:11.479
What? I ought to kick
your asses for saying that.

50:11.519 --> 50:15.039
Give me this instead.
Now scram! Get out of here!

50:21.119 --> 50:22.199
Cool.

50:31.638 --> 50:33.439
Simple Simon comin' at you.

50:33.439 --> 50:37.079
It's thirty minutes and counting
until Kiss hits the stage...

50:37.118 --> 50:39.479
tonight at Detroit's
very own Cobo Hall...

50:39.519 --> 50:43.239
but until then,
here they are with "Shock Me"!

50:43.278 --> 50:44.759
Rock on, Ace!

51:09.198 --> 51:10.999
Hey, little kid!

51:11.039 --> 51:13.318
Shit! You just stumped
my last ball, you--

51:13.359 --> 51:14.678
Scream and I'll kick
your head off.

51:14.719 --> 51:17.438
OK, booger,
your Kiss ticket or your life.

51:17.438 --> 51:19.358
Please, sir,
don't beat me up.

51:19.399 --> 51:21.558
I do have a Kiss ticket
but not on me.

51:21.599 --> 51:24.799
Oh, likely story.
Now hand it over, punk.

51:24.799 --> 51:28.119
No, really. My brother's
holding it for safekeeping.

51:28.159 --> 51:30.279
Please,
let me get him for you.

51:30.318 --> 51:31.999
Hey, Chongo.

51:42.559 --> 51:44.319
Look, little kid...

51:44.359 --> 51:46.839
I don't need to see Kiss
that bad.

51:46.879 --> 51:48.319
Don't try to run,
you maggot.

51:48.359 --> 51:50.959
Chongo's an all-state
track star in every event.

51:59.999 --> 52:03.679
Lookit, man,
you can have my wallet, OK?

52:03.679 --> 52:05.599
I was gonna take
your wallet anyway...

52:05.599 --> 52:07.519
after Chongo and his friends
crush your ribcage...

52:07.519 --> 52:09.919
Iike a pack of Luckys, punk.

52:09.958 --> 52:11.478
This fairy giving you shit, bro?

52:11.519 --> 52:14.199
He was gonna mug me
for my Kiss tickets.

52:14.239 --> 52:15.639
That's nuts.

52:15.679 --> 52:18.839
I said, "Hey, little kid...

52:18.878 --> 52:20.798
"you know where I could
take a piss?"

52:25.318 --> 52:28.358
OK, pimple dick, you have
the option of walking outside...

52:28.399 --> 52:29.479
or gettin' dragged out.

52:29.519 --> 52:31.039
Please, sir.

52:31.078 --> 52:32.878
Don't kick my ass!

52:32.919 --> 52:36.158
I'll do anything
to get out of a beating.

52:36.158 --> 52:38.358
Say, Chongo...

52:38.399 --> 52:40.718
perhaps we could use
some extra cash...

52:40.759 --> 52:42.679
for tasty snacks
at the Kiss concert...

52:42.719 --> 52:45.078
our weaselly friend
won't be attending.

52:55.199 --> 52:57.119
Hey, move those lights
over there.

53:13.878 --> 53:15.319
Hey, you.

53:15.359 --> 53:17.279
Man.

53:17.318 --> 53:18.639
Hey, come back here!

53:20.839 --> 53:22.199
Shit!

53:22.238 --> 53:24.119
Come here!
Come here!

53:29.599 --> 53:33.399
All right, wise guy.
You are so out of here.

53:33.439 --> 53:36.599
Fuck! Keep your paws
to yourself, you dumb ape.

53:36.639 --> 53:38.399
Where'd he go?

53:43.319 --> 53:47.918
It's been a while since my boy
had Holy Confession.

53:47.959 --> 53:48.998
Could you please--

53:49.039 --> 53:50.719
Consider it done.

54:10.999 --> 54:12.279
It is about time...

54:12.318 --> 54:15.839
you gave up that stupid dream
of yours once and for all!

54:15.839 --> 54:19.079
No son of mine is going
to be a career musician...

54:19.119 --> 54:20.678
ever, ever, ever!

54:20.718 --> 54:22.639
Madam, madam.

54:22.679 --> 54:24.319
We are in a cathedral.

54:24.359 --> 54:25.599
I'll walk you out.

54:25.599 --> 54:27.999
Sorry. Sorry.

54:33.279 --> 54:35.719
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

54:35.799 --> 54:38.239
This is my first confession
in a...

54:39.839 --> 54:41.359
really long time.

54:50.998 --> 54:52.959
That was our Viking
Patrick Hirsch...

54:52.999 --> 54:54.519
and he's hung like a Norse.

54:54.559 --> 54:56.399
Our next amateur
has a name like a bird...

54:56.439 --> 54:58.398
and if you like birds,
you'll like this.

54:58.599 --> 55:00.119
It's just a swallow.

55:00.159 --> 55:02.999
So, put your hands together,
make him feel at home...

55:03.039 --> 55:05.678
and please welcome...Hawk.

55:08.399 --> 55:10.479
Oh, shit.

55:10.519 --> 55:13.559
No, no, no, no.
No way, man.

55:13.599 --> 55:15.479
You're not going to
chicken out now, are you?

55:17.119 --> 55:18.479
You're right, Deacon.

55:19.518 --> 55:21.038
You're right, man.

55:22.079 --> 55:24.959
Shit! What am I saying?
I got to do this.

55:24.959 --> 55:26.079
It's for Kiss.

56:50.039 --> 56:51.799
Oh, my God!

57:22.879 --> 57:25.359
Oh, the stink!

59:26.558 --> 59:28.839
Man! Dang!

59:36.039 --> 59:37.079
Man!

59:37.118 --> 59:39.038
Come back here, you punk!

59:39.079 --> 59:40.599
Move!

59:50.479 --> 59:51.559
Move it!

59:51.599 --> 59:53.559
Get off me, you bitch!

59:56.119 --> 59:58.398
Get up.
Come on, move it, sweetie.

59:58.439 --> 59:59.799
Watch it, asshole.

59:59.839 --> 01:00:02.679
Where is he?
Where did he go this time?

01:00:06.239 --> 01:00:07.639
Two hundred bucks?

01:00:07.679 --> 01:00:08.839
My time's precious...

01:00:08.879 --> 01:00:11.678
and that's a reasonable price
to pay for your sorry life.

01:00:11.678 --> 01:00:13.239
Hold on, man.

01:00:14.759 --> 01:00:17.438
Look, I know how
I can get the money.

01:00:17.479 --> 01:00:19.358
I just figured it out, man.

01:00:22.279 --> 01:00:24.279
But you might want
to wait outside.

01:00:24.319 --> 01:00:25.279
I don't trust him.

01:00:25.319 --> 01:00:27.038
I think he's on the level.

01:00:27.038 --> 01:00:29.759
He's too stupid to do
anything sneaky anyway.

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:31.679
Look at him.
He's a moron.

01:00:33.439 --> 01:00:35.999
You got fifteen minutes
and not a second longer.

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:40.239
Are you sure that you
don't want to talk about...

01:00:40.279 --> 01:00:44.279
oh, carnal knowledge
with a neighborhood girl?

01:00:44.318 --> 01:00:49.039
Or how about finding a box
of magazines, huh?

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:50.839
Under your dad's bed?

01:00:54.239 --> 01:00:57.439
Then I suggest
you think of something...

01:00:57.479 --> 01:01:01.519
a little juicier to confess
than losing Kiss tickets.

01:01:23.639 --> 01:01:26.399
You waiting for a confession?
I thought you were Jewish.

01:01:26.438 --> 01:01:28.559
I have a confession.

01:01:41.238 --> 01:01:45.519
I didn't mean
for that to be so intense.

01:01:45.559 --> 01:01:46.719
I can take it.

01:01:48.279 --> 01:01:51.079
I've been in love with you
since the moment I saw you.

01:01:51.118 --> 01:01:54.159
I've just always been
too scared to show it.

01:01:54.159 --> 01:01:57.158
That's exactly the same way
I've always felt about you.

01:01:57.199 --> 01:01:59.199
Jeremiah, really?

01:01:59.239 --> 01:02:00.279
Really.

01:02:00.318 --> 01:02:03.198
And call me Jam.

01:02:03.198 --> 01:02:04.599
It's my band name.

01:02:12.319 --> 01:02:15.999
And now, for our grand prize
of one hundred dollars...

01:02:16.039 --> 01:02:17.919
Don't worry, ladies.
I'm not competing.

01:02:17.959 --> 01:02:20.039
If I did,
you'd want your money back.

01:02:20.078 --> 01:02:21.438
And the winner is...

01:02:23.679 --> 01:02:24.959
Sir Loin!

01:02:42.119 --> 01:02:44.479
Hey, don't look so sad.

01:02:44.519 --> 01:02:45.959
The night is young--

01:02:45.999 --> 01:02:48.359
filled with compensatory
possibilities.

01:02:50.518 --> 01:02:52.158
Oh, thanks for the drinks.

01:02:52.198 --> 01:02:54.679
That was really generous.

01:02:55.679 --> 01:02:59.838
There's no reason for me to be
around these parts anymore.

01:02:59.879 --> 01:03:02.559
I'm in a position
to spend some money on you...

01:03:02.598 --> 01:03:06.039
if you'd get in a position
and spend some time on me.

01:03:24.279 --> 01:03:26.639
I can't believe you're thinking
of robbing this store.

01:03:26.679 --> 01:03:28.399
You don't pass "Go" and collect
two hundred dollars...

01:03:28.439 --> 01:03:30.239
for pulling stuff like this.

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:32.478
No shit.
Is this really worth it?

01:03:32.639 --> 01:03:34.359
Sure, you're going
to get your ass kicked...

01:03:34.398 --> 01:03:36.719
nine ways to Sunday
by that fucking gorilla...

01:03:36.759 --> 01:03:39.399
but that's still
a hundred times better...

01:03:39.439 --> 01:03:42.319
than getting it porked
for the next three to five.

01:03:42.358 --> 01:03:43.919
What about that girl, Trip?

01:03:43.959 --> 01:03:46.119
She'll never forget this night.

01:03:46.159 --> 01:03:49.199
Even if you get away with it,
she'll be scarred for life.

01:03:49.239 --> 01:03:52.079
When are you going to realize
that sometimes being tough...

01:03:52.118 --> 01:03:53.959
means being tender?

01:03:53.999 --> 01:03:56.319
All right, everybody,
shut up!

01:04:10.319 --> 01:04:12.239
I'm going to have
to do this sometime.

01:04:20.159 --> 01:04:21.759
Might as well be now.

01:04:23.879 --> 01:04:24.959
Evening, honey.

01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:27.519
You know what I am,
what this is...

01:04:27.519 --> 01:04:29.718
and what you need to do,
so let's do it quick.

01:04:29.759 --> 01:04:31.318
Everybody else...

01:04:31.358 --> 01:04:34.559
kindly introduce yourselves
to the floor and kiss it hello.

01:04:36.479 --> 01:04:38.318
Do it or die, bitch.

01:04:38.359 --> 01:04:39.958
I'm just a high school kid.

01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:42.479
Fuck school!

01:04:42.679 --> 01:04:45.839
I went through the motions till
I was old enough to drop out.

01:04:45.878 --> 01:04:48.519
And where's all that studying
going to get you tonight?

01:04:48.559 --> 01:04:52.279
Robbed at gunpoint and possibly
shot in the fucking head!

01:04:53.919 --> 01:04:56.799
Hey, scumbag, drop it,
or I'll blow your head off.

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:03.799
You and what army?

01:05:07.199 --> 01:05:08.759
The Kiss Army.

01:05:42.559 --> 01:05:44.119
Oh, God, they're in there.

01:06:01.639 --> 01:06:03.238
Oh, shit!

01:06:03.279 --> 01:06:04.358
Come on!

01:06:19.999 --> 01:06:22.079
God, if you
get me out of this...

01:06:22.119 --> 01:06:25.519
I swear I will never
pull my pork again.

01:06:26.999 --> 01:06:28.679
Give me your gun, boy.

01:06:28.719 --> 01:06:30.319
You give me your gun, boy.

01:06:30.359 --> 01:06:32.438
I don't even think
you have a gun.

01:06:32.479 --> 01:06:33.919
Neither do l.

01:06:33.958 --> 01:06:35.959
For the last time...

01:06:35.998 --> 01:06:37.798
take the piece out...

01:06:37.839 --> 01:06:39.119
Iay back down...

01:06:39.119 --> 01:06:41.039
or your mom's
going to need Mr. Clean...

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:43.599
to get the brains
out of your ski cap!

01:07:24.158 --> 01:07:26.199
Thank you.

01:07:27.479 --> 01:07:28.799
Who are you?

01:07:28.799 --> 01:07:31.159
Eh, they call me Dr. Love.

01:07:45.999 --> 01:07:47.399
Is it true that Gene Simmons...

01:07:47.439 --> 01:07:50.359
had a cow's tongue grafted
onto his real tongue?

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:52.079
I think he, uh...

01:07:52.119 --> 01:07:54.359
had the piece of skin
under his tongue removed...

01:07:54.559 --> 01:07:56.159
so he could
stick it out farther.

01:07:56.199 --> 01:07:58.559
I was going to
send you this, but...

01:07:59.519 --> 01:08:00.638
Ann Arbor?

01:08:00.679 --> 01:08:03.958
Yeah. My dad's company
is relocating him.

01:08:04.159 --> 01:08:06.479
That's why I was acting
so freaky at school today.

01:08:06.558 --> 01:08:09.079
I thought it'd be the last time
I'd ever see you.

01:08:21.638 --> 01:08:23.278
Oh, fuck.

01:08:25.519 --> 01:08:28.519
You'd better have something
really sinful for me this time.

01:08:28.559 --> 01:08:31.158
All right, Father,
here it is.

01:08:31.198 --> 01:08:33.158
I feel a little ashamed
talking to you about this...

01:08:33.238 --> 01:08:35.999
but I went
to my cousin's wedding...

01:08:36.038 --> 01:08:37.798
and one of the bridesmaids...

01:08:37.837 --> 01:08:40.759
asked me if I wanted
to take a bath.

01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:42.877
This is terrible.

01:08:42.917 --> 01:08:44.559
This girl was a total fox...

01:08:44.599 --> 01:08:46.758
so I finally
gave into temptation...

01:08:46.799 --> 01:08:48.559
about a block away
from the wedding reception...

01:08:48.599 --> 01:08:50.519
at this little motel
that charges by the hour.

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:53.238
When she peeled off that gown...

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:58.279
you are not going to believe
what she was wearing underneath.

01:08:58.319 --> 01:08:59.559
Was it a teddy?

01:09:01.038 --> 01:09:02.719
A bustier?

01:09:03.719 --> 01:09:05.118
Satin underwear?

01:09:06.719 --> 01:09:08.479
Crotchless panties?

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:10.519
Leopard-skin bra?

01:09:11.519 --> 01:09:13.158
Fishnet leotard?

01:09:13.198 --> 01:09:15.559
A leather G-string?

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:19.358
All right, guys, here.
You want a sandwich?

01:09:19.358 --> 01:09:21.399
Come on. Go. Go!

01:09:21.438 --> 01:09:24.037
OK, fuck it, man.
I give up.

01:09:27.839 --> 01:09:30.759
Oh, God, man, what now?
Wolves?

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:43.319
All right.

01:09:58.399 --> 01:10:01.279
I jump in the car.
I hot-wire it in thirty seconds.

01:10:01.319 --> 01:10:03.678
I start driving.
Suddenly, I hear this scream.

01:10:03.719 --> 01:10:07.159
The disco queen was asleep
in the backseat the whole time.

01:10:08.159 --> 01:10:10.079
What are we going
to do with her anyway?

01:10:10.119 --> 01:10:11.999
I don't know,
but she looks like fun.

01:10:16.959 --> 01:10:18.639
Hey, hey, take it easy.

01:10:19.599 --> 01:10:20.838
Ah, God.

01:10:20.879 --> 01:10:23.679
You don't want to get any
whiskey dick around here.

01:10:23.679 --> 01:10:26.279
Of course, you don't have
to worry about that.

01:10:28.159 --> 01:10:31.079
Aw, shit.

01:10:31.119 --> 01:10:33.479
I see you've met
Premature Peter.

01:10:33.719 --> 01:10:34.759
I'm sorry.

01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:35.999
That's OK.

01:10:36.039 --> 01:10:37.879
It's been quite a night.

01:10:37.919 --> 01:10:40.239
So far, you've seen
me and my dick throw up.

01:10:40.479 --> 01:10:43.318
I'm sure there's more
where that came from, right?

01:10:45.999 --> 01:10:47.759
Now come here.

01:11:00.318 --> 01:11:01.759
You guys better kill me...

01:11:01.759 --> 01:11:03.839
before you do what
you're thinking about doing...

01:11:03.878 --> 01:11:06.959
because when I get angry,
I can bite down very hard.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.279
Sweet Polly Purebred's
got some spunk, huh?

01:11:10.279 --> 01:11:12.039
I'll give her some spunk,
all right.

01:11:12.079 --> 01:11:13.959
We can strip that Beemer
in fifteen minutes.

01:11:13.999 --> 01:11:16.319
I say we can strip her
in fifteen seconds.

01:11:17.358 --> 01:11:20.238
Now, wait a minute, guys.
Two on one ain't fair.

01:11:20.279 --> 01:11:22.359
Why don't you let me
get my friend Barbara?

01:11:22.398 --> 01:11:25.599
You'd love her--
tits the size of your head.

01:11:25.639 --> 01:11:27.439
You'll feel like
a little baby sucking on them.

01:11:27.479 --> 01:11:29.079
You guys like disco?

01:11:29.119 --> 01:11:31.279
I teach disco dancing
back at my church.

01:11:31.318 --> 01:11:33.398
You guys look like you got
a little rhythm in your blood.

01:11:33.439 --> 01:11:36.319
Free lessons if you let me go.

01:11:36.319 --> 01:11:40.519
Oh, I know a dance we could do--
the Horizontal Hustle.

01:11:44.398 --> 01:11:46.158
Hey, peanut turds.

01:11:46.199 --> 01:11:48.679
I'm here for the girl
and the car.

01:11:48.719 --> 01:11:50.479
You can try to stop me...

01:11:50.519 --> 01:11:52.079
but you're not going to like
what happens if you do.

01:11:52.119 --> 01:11:54.639
It's too bad.
He was such a young idiot.

01:11:54.679 --> 01:11:57.119
Hey, he's a stupid boy.

01:11:57.199 --> 01:11:59.039
He deserves to fucking die.

01:12:08.399 --> 01:12:10.679
Tear these grease monkeys
a new asshole!

01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:25.119
One step out of that office,
and your asses are Alpo.

01:12:27.999 --> 01:12:29.919
I always come prepared.

01:12:38.879 --> 01:12:40.718
You're the coolest.

01:12:40.758 --> 01:12:43.959
I believe you were promised
a ride to Disco lnferno.

01:12:44.158 --> 01:12:45.798
Let me escort you to the car.

01:12:45.838 --> 01:12:47.479
What about the fucking dogs?

01:12:47.519 --> 01:12:49.559
You got a phone in there, man?

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:51.239
Call the cops.

01:12:51.278 --> 01:12:52.759
You're fuckin' dead!

01:12:57.599 --> 01:12:59.159
Beth, I feel like such an idiot.

01:12:59.199 --> 01:13:01.878
Why didn't I just say something
a year and a half ago?

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:04.239
Don't think about the past.

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:07.319
Let's just think about
from today on.

01:13:08.519 --> 01:13:10.239
I'll never forget you, Jam.

01:13:10.239 --> 01:13:12.398
Church will never be the same.

01:13:29.479 --> 01:13:32.159
God damn it, Beth!

01:13:32.159 --> 01:13:33.559
I'm coming, Dad.

01:13:35.039 --> 01:13:36.119
Well...

01:13:37.839 --> 01:13:39.318
So...

01:13:39.359 --> 01:13:42.718
I'll call you,
as soon as we get a phone.

01:13:42.758 --> 01:13:44.358
-All right.
-Yeah.

01:14:08.599 --> 01:14:09.719
I hope this helps.

01:14:09.759 --> 01:14:11.439
No, no.
You know what?

01:14:11.479 --> 01:14:12.999
Strange as it may seem...

01:14:13.039 --> 01:14:15.839
I don't think
I can take the money.

01:14:15.839 --> 01:14:18.199
It would cheapen
the whole experience.

01:14:18.238 --> 01:14:21.719
I ain't no Midnight Cowboy
or anything like that.

01:14:23.038 --> 01:14:24.519
I'm not paying you
for the lovemaking.

01:14:24.558 --> 01:14:26.439
I just want you to have this...

01:14:26.439 --> 01:14:29.279
for whatever you needed it for
when I made the offer.

01:14:33.679 --> 01:14:35.639
Thanks.

01:14:36.758 --> 01:14:38.438
Was there any money taken?

01:14:38.479 --> 01:14:39.519
Nope...

01:14:39.559 --> 01:14:43.119
but it is Smiley Mart's policy
to give a cash reward of $150...

01:14:43.159 --> 01:14:45.678
to anyone who stops a robbery.

01:14:46.638 --> 01:14:49.239
I gave him the money,
and he took off.

01:14:51.639 --> 01:14:53.358
Thanks.

01:14:53.559 --> 01:14:55.679
You see this guy again,
call us, all right?

01:14:55.719 --> 01:14:57.878
We want to ask him
a few questions.

01:14:57.918 --> 01:14:59.919
If I see Dr. Love again
anytime soon...

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:03.159
you're going to have to wait
till I'm done with him first.

01:15:09.439 --> 01:15:11.318
One-thirty...

01:15:11.359 --> 01:15:14.119
one-forty, and one-fifty.

01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:16.079
That's all I got, man.

01:15:22.359 --> 01:15:24.439
I really wanted things
to work out for you...

01:15:24.479 --> 01:15:26.278
my weaselly,
dimwitted friend.

01:15:26.318 --> 01:15:28.519
You got spunk.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:49.439
At least I still got you,
Stretch.

01:15:54.199 --> 01:15:55.519
I took his head off.

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:05.118
Kiss? How dare they call
themselves Kiss.

01:16:05.159 --> 01:16:06.478
Kiss is about love.

01:16:06.519 --> 01:16:11.958
They are teaching our children
lust, betrayal, and hate.

01:16:11.999 --> 01:16:13.878
We as parents are obligated--

01:16:13.919 --> 01:16:15.479
How's it going, Mom?

01:16:16.719 --> 01:16:19.638
I'm going to ask you
this nicely first.

01:16:19.679 --> 01:16:21.239
Can I have my drumsticks back?

01:16:21.278 --> 01:16:25.678
Your drumsticks are the least
of your worries, young man.

01:16:25.719 --> 01:16:27.119
You ran out on God!

01:16:27.159 --> 01:16:29.719
My son just ran out on God!

01:16:29.759 --> 01:16:32.159
You are in a world of--

01:16:32.398 --> 01:16:33.959
Trouble?

01:16:33.999 --> 01:16:36.879
I've been in trouble
for the past twelve hours.

01:16:37.839 --> 01:16:40.999
I'm going to be in St. Bernard's
boarding school...

01:16:41.039 --> 01:16:43.199
for the next two years
of my life, remember?

01:16:43.238 --> 01:16:46.359
I'm going to be out of your hair
until I am a legal adult!

01:16:46.398 --> 01:16:48.399
Then all you have to do
is go to church...

01:16:48.438 --> 01:16:50.999
Iight a candle, and pray
to some stupid statue...

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:53.159
and all is forgiven
and forgotten, right, Mom?

01:16:53.199 --> 01:16:55.919
Then you can spend your days
in a guilt-free pursuit...

01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:57.758
of more constructive
activities...

01:16:57.799 --> 01:17:01.559
Iike telling everybody else
how screwed up their lives are.

01:17:01.598 --> 01:17:03.159
Then you no longer
need the patience...

01:17:03.199 --> 01:17:04.638
and understanding required...

01:17:04.679 --> 01:17:08.878
in order to talk to your own son
on some normal plane.

01:17:08.919 --> 01:17:10.839
That way,
you don't even need to think...

01:17:10.879 --> 01:17:13.679
about how tough it was for you
when you were growing up.

01:17:13.719 --> 01:17:15.999
It's probably a good thing, too,
'cause if you did...

01:17:16.039 --> 01:17:17.559
you'd realize what a lousy...

01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:20.519
goddamn,
shitty-ass parent you are.

01:17:25.478 --> 01:17:27.239
What has gotten into you?

01:17:28.679 --> 01:17:32.239
I just lost my virginity
in a confessional booth!

01:17:32.279 --> 01:17:34.999
Lord have mercy!

01:17:36.919 --> 01:17:38.119
Now...

01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:40.558
for the last time...

01:17:40.599 --> 01:17:44.519
Mom, give me back
my fucking drumsticks.

01:17:45.798 --> 01:17:46.879
Please.

01:18:02.079 --> 01:18:03.198
Cute.

01:18:20.439 --> 01:18:22.879
They grow upfast,
don't they?

01:18:24.959 --> 01:18:26.799
Hey, dude.

01:18:26.839 --> 01:18:28.959
Dude, I got the cash, man.
Check it out.

01:18:30.679 --> 01:18:32.678
No, that can't be
the last ticket!

01:18:32.719 --> 01:18:33.918
God!

01:18:34.639 --> 01:18:37.239
You fucking bastard!

01:19:18.758 --> 01:19:20.599
Any luck?

01:19:20.639 --> 01:19:24.639
Yeah, man, plenty,
but it was all bad, man.

01:19:24.678 --> 01:19:26.079
I found the Volvo.

01:19:28.879 --> 01:19:30.239
Tickets?

01:19:35.599 --> 01:19:37.519
Wait a second.
I know how we can get in.

01:19:37.559 --> 01:19:41.398
I say that we beat the shit
out of each other, right?

01:19:41.438 --> 01:19:42.839
Then we go
to the ticket taker...

01:19:42.879 --> 01:19:46.279
and we say that we got mugged
and our tickets were stolen.

01:19:46.319 --> 01:19:49.279
They have to let us in then,
right?

01:19:53.839 --> 01:19:55.079
Why not?

01:20:25.878 --> 01:20:26.999
Go.

01:20:27.959 --> 01:20:29.919
No! God!

01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:32.239
Oh, man,
you got to let us in.

01:20:32.278 --> 01:20:33.839
Four muggers
just stole our tickets.

01:20:34.039 --> 01:20:35.959
You expect me to believe that?

01:20:35.999 --> 01:20:37.918
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:20:39.278 --> 01:20:40.518
Look at us.

01:20:42.199 --> 01:20:43.639
It was those assholes
right there!

01:20:43.678 --> 01:20:45.159
They stole our tickets!

01:20:45.198 --> 01:20:47.199
Number thirteen!

01:20:47.239 --> 01:20:48.919
Hey, stop those guys.

01:20:53.319 --> 01:20:54.958
They got tickets.

01:20:55.159 --> 01:20:56.279
Let's see.
Come here.

01:20:56.318 --> 01:20:58.079
They even stole my wallet, man.

01:20:58.079 --> 01:21:00.519
I've never even seen
these assholes before.

01:21:00.559 --> 01:21:03.878
In there, you'll find
my Kiss Army picture l.D...

01:21:03.919 --> 01:21:05.879
and a hundred and fifty bucks
cash.

01:21:12.959 --> 01:21:14.519
-Out of here.
-Damn.

01:21:18.238 --> 01:21:20.479
My midget weaselly friend.

01:21:20.519 --> 01:21:24.318
I was really hoping things
could work out for you.

01:21:24.359 --> 01:21:26.279
You got spunk.

01:21:26.319 --> 01:21:28.279
Go.

01:21:28.319 --> 01:21:29.399
I got it, man.

01:21:29.439 --> 01:21:30.879
We're going.

01:21:57.799 --> 01:21:59.398
OK, then.

01:22:10.079 --> 01:22:11.318
We want Kiss!

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.719
This is it.

01:22:32.079 --> 01:22:34.679
You wanted the best,
and you got the best!

01:22:34.879 --> 01:22:36.799
The hottest band in the world--

01:22:36.879 --> 01:22:38.279
Kiss!

01:22:55.358 --> 01:22:58.039
I feel uptight
on a Saturday night

01:23:00.318 --> 01:23:01.559
Nine o'clock

01:23:01.759 --> 01:23:04.718
The radio's the only light

01:23:05.798 --> 01:23:06.839
I hear my song

01:23:06.879 --> 01:23:08.479
And it pulls me through

01:23:10.639 --> 01:23:12.319
It comes on strong

01:23:12.358 --> 01:23:14.479
Tells me what I got to do

01:23:14.519 --> 01:23:15.559
I got to

01:23:15.599 --> 01:23:16.639
Get up

01:23:16.679 --> 01:23:18.438
Everybody's gonna
move their feet

01:23:18.479 --> 01:23:19.519
Get down

01:23:19.559 --> 01:23:22.039
Everybody's gonna
leave their seat

01:23:22.879 --> 01:23:26.399
You gotta lose your mind
in Detroit Rock City

01:23:26.439 --> 01:23:27.839
Get up

01:23:27.879 --> 01:23:29.159
Everybody's gonna
move their feet

01:23:29.199 --> 01:23:30.559
Get down

01:23:30.559 --> 01:23:31.999
Everybody's gonna
leave their seat

01:23:51.318 --> 01:23:54.079
Movin' fast,
doin' ninety-five

01:23:56.199 --> 01:23:58.079
I hit top speed

01:23:58.119 --> 01:24:00.599
Still movin' much too slow

01:24:01.918 --> 01:24:03.199
I feel so good

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:05.479
I'm so alive

01:24:07.239 --> 01:24:08.639
I hear my song

01:24:08.679 --> 01:24:10.359
Playin' on the radio

01:24:10.398 --> 01:24:12.119
And it goes

01:24:12.159 --> 01:24:13.239
Get up

01:24:13.279 --> 01:24:16.278
Everybody's gonna
move their feet

01:24:39.799 --> 01:24:40.878
Get up

01:24:40.919 --> 01:24:43.799
Everybody's gonna
leave their seat

01:30:34.919 --> 01:30:36.799
We don't have any Kiss tickets.

01:30:36.799 --> 01:30:38.999
Yeah. Kiss sucks!
