<i>LANGSTON:
I heard that when a mother bestows</i>

00:43.160 --> 00:46.184
<i>a name on her child,
she reveals her hope.</i>

00:47.240 --> 00:51.390
<i>Mine named me Langston, like
the poet, Langston Hughes.</i>

00:51.520 --> 00:55.864
<i>She had great hope for me. But
whatever dreams she had before...</i>

00:56.080 --> 00:57.705
<i>they got deferred in Baltimore.</i>

01:02.280 --> 01:04.462
<i>Been me and her since my
first steps on this earth.</i>

01:05.760 --> 01:08.227
<i>My daddy went MIA after my birth.</i>

01:10.120 --> 01:12.382
<i>I used to envy happy
families on the street.</i>

01:13.360 --> 01:16.519
<i>After a while,
I chose not to see.</i>

01:16.520 --> 01:18.384
<i>Got to stay strong
for Mom and me.</i>

01:22.200 --> 01:24.746
<i>Unanswered prayers make you weak.</i>

01:30.120 --> 01:32.905
<i>(LANGSTON SINGING) This right
here is a cold, cold town</i>

01:36.480 --> 01:38.901
<i>I don't know why I'm here</i>

01:39.480 --> 01:43.062
<i>Or where I am going anymore</i>

01:44.320 --> 01:48.744
<i>Mama tried to save me
from the street war</i>

01:49.160 --> 01:53.424
<i>But I don't need no savior
Yo, I'm good</i>

01:53.640 --> 01:55.742
<i>Yeah, we 'bout to ride hard</i>

01:56.160 --> 01:58.501
<i>I know I'm young,
but sometimes I feel old</i>

01:58.680 --> 02:01.101
<i>Things I need can't
be bought or sold</i>

02:01.240 --> 02:03.719
<i>A mother's love or a father's name</i>

02:03.720 --> 02:06.107
<i>Nothing heavier than
the weight of shame</i>

02:06.320 --> 02:08.359
<i>I flip my collar so they can't see</i>

02:08.360 --> 02:10.622
<i>The tears fallin' down inside of me</i>

02:10.840 --> 02:13.102
<i>Got to roll out, got things to do</i>

02:13.240 --> 02:16.628
<i>Lace up, head up, foot down, move</i>

02:18.200 --> 02:20.302
<i>Walk like you've got a purpose</i>

02:22.760 --> 02:25.227
<i>I can't let them see me nervous</i>

02:27.360 --> 02:30.782
<i>'Cause this right here
is the coldest town</i>

02:32.360 --> 02:34.986
<i>You can't let it bring you down</i>

02:52.880 --> 02:54.982
<i>This is my Christmas story.</i>

03:05.440 --> 03:07.065
Yo, yo, yo.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.990
Hey, Ma.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.185
What took you so long?

03:13.320 --> 03:15.104
I ran into Kyle and Snoop.
(CHUCKLES)

03:18.760 --> 03:20.191
What's wrong?

03:29.160 --> 03:31.467
We've been evicted?

03:31.560 --> 03:33.540
I thought you were working
it out with the bank.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.021
We'd rent it back.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.069
It's hard to get
that much together.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.626
So we got to move?

03:39.800 --> 03:41.584
Where will we live, Ma?

03:42.240 --> 03:44.991
Why didn't you tell me?
I can help you.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.421
Help me?

03:47.080 --> 03:50.184
You got $5,000? That's what
they want before Christmas.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.582
So you're just letting
them throw us out?

03:53.640 --> 03:55.759
You have no idea what I had to do

03:55.760 --> 03:58.750
just to keep a roof over your
head for the past 15 years.

03:59.160 --> 04:02.343
Making sure you got clothes
and you're fed. I did that!

04:04.160 --> 04:06.183
And I'm letting them kick us out?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.510
(DOOR CLOSES)

04:26.400 --> 04:28.184
(ENGINE STARTING)

05:03.000 --> 05:04.101
It's Naima.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.465
I need you to take
Langston for the holidays.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.302
I'm putting him on the 10 A.M. bus.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.879
He gets into Times Square at 1:15.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.301
He'll have this number
and your address.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.065
I hope you get this message.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.341
Who was on the phone?

05:20.400 --> 05:21.501
You're sending me away?

05:22.640 --> 05:24.504
To spend the holidays
with your grandparents.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.742
My grandparents?
I don't even know them.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.146
They live in Harlem.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.941
What about you?

05:32.400 --> 05:35.026
I got to work. We
barely see each other.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.423
- So you're sending me off to strangers?
- They're not strangers.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.701
At Christmas?

05:39.840 --> 05:43.023
No. I ain't going.
I ain't leaving you alone.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.102
If I know you're
safe, I'll be okay.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.702
I'll come get you as soon as I can.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.786
Langston, I'm just thinking
about what's best for you.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.702
I've done everything I can.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.065
Whatever.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.551
<i>(SINGING) This love in my heart</i>

06:14.800 --> 06:17.585
<i>Is all I have left</i>

06:17.800 --> 06:19.584
<i>That's not enough</i>

06:21.120 --> 06:23.222
<i>But it's my best</i>

06:23.640 --> 06:26.425
<i>So I'll set you free</i>

06:26.960 --> 06:29.427
<i>Pray that you'll fly</i>

06:29.800 --> 06:31.902
<i>And come back to me</i>

06:32.800 --> 06:35.028
<i>Better than I</i>

06:35.960 --> 06:38.745
<i>You've got my mother's eyes</i>

06:39.000 --> 06:41.751
<i>And you've got my father's hands</i>

06:42.320 --> 06:47.108
<i>And Mama can't teach you
Things you can only learn from a man</i>

06:48.000 --> 06:50.785
<i>Our hearts beat in sync so</i>

06:51.000 --> 06:53.785
<i>I'm gonna be off beat</i>

06:54.000 --> 06:58.628
<i>Until the day you come back to me</i>

06:59.160 --> 07:01.786
<i>In the meantime</i>

07:02.000 --> 07:04.944
<i>I'll be wishing on stars</i>

07:05.360 --> 07:08.111
<i>Praying for change</i>

07:08.360 --> 07:10.781
<i>And mending my heart</i>

07:11.000 --> 07:13.626
<i>In the meantime</i>

07:14.200 --> 07:16.780
<i>I'll cry myself awake</i>

<i>'Cause there's no testament</i>

07:40.720 --> 07:43.141
<i>But you're so much better</i>

07:43.880 --> 07:46.142
<i>Be someone else</i>

07:46.720 --> 07:49.505
<i>'Cause I let you down</i>

07:49.880 --> 07:52.347
<i>It's time you get up</i>

07:52.720 --> 07:55.141
<i>And fight for yourself</i>

07:55.400 --> 07:58.185
<i>'Cause I messed things up</i>

<i>I'm the one thing standing

Sometimes I feel like
a motherless child.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.021
Yo.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.110
I feel you.

09:49.520 --> 09:52.624
When a mother bestows
a name on a child...

09:53.360 --> 09:57.021
it reveals her hope.
Mine named me Isaiah.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.423
Like the prophet.

Reverend, I believe this is the
young man you were looking for.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.910
You've made a mistake.

16:23.080 --> 16:26.024
I was told to expect my grandson...

16:26.160 --> 16:29.742
not some pickpocket, so
anxious to transgress that...

16:29.920 --> 16:32.864
rather than wait for his
grandparents as instructed...

16:33.000 --> 16:35.100
he'd run off and violate
the first law he could.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.919
I ain't no damn pickpocket.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.591
I wasn't lifting the guy's
wallet, I was giving it back.

16:40.160 --> 16:44.629
This kid jacked my backpack
and took all my money.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.463
I was trying to call you.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.706
No one pressed charges. So, we're
releasing him into your custody.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.622
Welcome to New York, young man.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.144

125th Street.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.391
The main street of Harlem.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.507
Your namesake, Langston Hughes...

17:32.640 --> 17:36.745
once said he would rather
be a lamppost in Harlem...

17:36.880 --> 17:38.982
than the governor of Georgia.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.511
What are you doing?

17:55.400 --> 17:57.184
- Hey, Rev.
- Maria.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.185
Are you being good?

18:00.760 --> 18:01.861
I guess.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.624
Merry Christmas, babe.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.862
- My grandson.
- Nice to meet you.

Maria! Come on,
let's do it. Come on.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.782
You're in the middle of the street.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.705
I'm saying hi to the Rev.
You're embarrassing.

Would you rather get
hit or be embarrassed?

your visit. Oh, you poor thing.

18:59.120 --> 19:03.430
Fortunately, Officer Mac is a
good friend of the church.

19:05.160 --> 19:06.830
It never hurts to have a friend

19:06.840 --> 19:08.749
on the force in case of these...

19:09.320 --> 19:10.751
misunderstandings.

19:12.160 --> 19:15.264
We say grace before
we eat in this house.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.751
Let us pray.

19:19.480 --> 19:23.790
Lord, bless this food to our
use and us to Thy service.

19:24.160 --> 19:28.629
And make us ever mindful of the
needs of others for Christ's sake.

19:29.840 --> 19:34.946
Lord Jesus, today we are mindful
of the needs of this youth...

19:35.360 --> 19:39.943
our grandson, whom Thou, in Thy
infinite wisdom, has sent to us.

19:40.080 --> 19:43.548
And be he troubled and
in need of guidance...

19:43.680 --> 19:47.785
or simply a belt to hold his
loose-fitting pants up...

19:48.200 --> 19:52.146
allow us the fortitude and
patience to set him straight.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.622
For Thou art ever bountiful.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.145
Father God...

19:57.680 --> 20:01.387
lead this boy not into temptation,
but deliver him from evil.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.479
And allow him to walk in Thy steps

20:03.480 --> 20:06.311
down the path of righteousness...

20:06.440 --> 20:09.066
and with Your help, obedience.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.399
For Thine is the
kingdom and the power

20:11.400 --> 20:14.151
and the glory, forever and ever.

20:14.720 --> 20:15.981

20:20.040 --> 20:21.505
Langston...

20:22.240 --> 20:24.719
to what, besides heavenly grace,

20:24.720 --> 20:27.346
do we owe the pleasure
of this visit?

20:30.240 --> 20:32.342
She's working over Christmas.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.342
Where is she working these days?

20:37.240 --> 20:41.868
She tends bar Monday through Thursday,
and does checkout weekends.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.785
She used to work for the
city, but they laid her off.

20:46.240 --> 20:49.025
Does she have anyone to help her...

20:49.240 --> 20:52.025
or are you the man of the house?

20:54.680 --> 20:56.862
You guys don't know a
thing about us, do you?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.465
No fault of ours.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.703
Then whose fault is it?

21:08.600 --> 21:10.031
May I be excused?

21:11.520 --> 21:12.860
Clear your plate.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.905
Just let him be.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.584
REVEREND:
What do you find so amusing?

22:00.480 --> 22:03.584
This place, it's like
a museum up here.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.750
A black people museum.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.422
I like to remember where
we've come from...

22:10.680 --> 22:15.104
and what it's taken to
get us where we are.

22:37.360 --> 22:40.464
Read the engraving...

22:41.360 --> 22:42.700
in here.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.302
LANGSTON: "To C.C. from M.L.K."

22:49.520 --> 22:50.826
Yes.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.668
- That's Martin Luther King.
- Yes.

22:57.040 --> 23:00.826
My father, your
great-grandfather...

23:01.720 --> 23:03.822
was in King's inner circle.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.824
Look here.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.982
He marched with him in Selma...

23:11.720 --> 23:13.151
Birmingham...

23:13.880 --> 23:16.426
and Memphis. I was
with him every time.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.661
That's me there.

23:19.080 --> 23:22.502
The year that King died...

23:23.560 --> 23:27.028
he asked a few of us children...

23:27.400 --> 23:30.663
to come speak at his
church in Atlanta.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.024
I was the youngest.

23:35.240 --> 23:39.504
Dr. King felt I spoke so
eloquently, he sent me this watch.

23:49.080 --> 23:52.024
This will be yours someday.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.519
<i>ARETHA: I know this is...</i>

23:57.520 --> 23:59.463
a big adjustment for you.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.279
For all of us. But I
want you to know that

24:02.280 --> 24:04.542
we're very happy to have you here.

24:05.440 --> 24:09.067
This is a girl's room,
so I hope you don't mind.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.226
What went down with
you guys and my mom?

24:16.120 --> 24:17.904
Why don't you talk?

24:18.360 --> 24:20.064
She ran away.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.303
For a long time, we thought
she'd come back, but...

24:24.560 --> 24:25.639
(SIGHS)

24:25.640 --> 24:27.742
she couldn't forgive us.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.821
Why?

24:30.320 --> 24:31.910
What'd you do to her?

24:32.040 --> 24:36.987

us out on the street.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.541
out.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.999
Whatever you need,
come see your boy!

38:01.000 --> 38:03.546
Your boyfriend left you?
Pawn the stuff he bought you.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.711
Lunch money.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.479
If lifting wallets is for chumps,

38:09.480 --> 38:12.060
what do you call this?
The big time?

38:12.720 --> 38:15.585
This gig is an opportunity,
you play it right.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.585
What was you doing in
there, buying or selling?

38:19.000 --> 38:20.101
Just looking.

38:20.280 --> 38:23.429
You need something? I got more than
you could ever get in a store.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.902
No, I'm good. Thank you.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.507
Anything you can
think of, I got it.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.265
I said, I'm straight.

38:31.320 --> 38:33.741
If you change your mind,
I'll be right here.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.425
Yeah, whatever.

38:41.400 --> 38:45.346
It's about time. Your grandmother's
been waiting for you.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.705
Is it ready?

39:01.600 --> 39:03.031
Tastes good to me.

39:03.080 --> 39:07.185
Okay. You put that there
and pour it into the crust.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.384
Mrs. Cobbs?

39:20.360 --> 39:22.542
I don't really know
what to call you.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.064
Oh, well...

39:28.600 --> 39:30.702
you could try Grandma.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.383
"Grandma" feels weird.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.999
Yes, yes. To me, too.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.101
(CHUCKLES)

39:43.480 --> 39:47.221
Maybe we can take our time
with it. Let it grow on us?

39:48.960 --> 39:50.221
Okay.

39:54.480 --> 39:57.639
My mom ran away because
she got pregnant, right?

39:57.640 --> 39:59.265
That's why she and
the Rev don't speak?

40:01.240 --> 40:02.341
Because of me?

40:03.640 --> 40:05.742
No, baby, not because of you.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.224
(CHOPPING VEGETABLES)

40:15.320 --> 40:17.319
Your dad was kind of a rascal,

40:17.320 --> 40:20.344
pretending to be a gangster,
pants hanging below his butt.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.024
He had it rough.

40:25.680 --> 40:28.624
When he was with us, he'd
show us his sweet side.

40:28.840 --> 40:31.181
The Reverend thought
the devil had his name.

40:35.520 --> 40:39.625
Your grandfather is very proud,
in case you hadn't noticed.

40:40.040 --> 40:43.279
Being a prominent minister, he
was more than just embarrassed

40:43.280 --> 40:45.144
that his daughter was with child.

40:45.880 --> 40:47.789
<i>She was only fifteen.</i>

40:49.360 --> 40:50.985
<i>He wanted to kill the boy.</i>

40:52.720 --> 40:56.461
<i>Threatened to tear him
apart with his bare hands.</i>

40:58.800 --> 41:02.302
<i>He kind of put Naima
under house arrest.</i>

41:02.560 --> 41:04.742
<i>He wouldn't let him
anywhere near her.</i>

41:06.040 --> 41:07.505
But she must have loved him...

41:07.560 --> 41:11.301
<i>because one day, we woke
up and she was gone.</i>

41:14.560 --> 41:17.199
But my dad left before I was two.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.189
My mom never mentions him or you.

41:21.160 --> 41:23.262
Mistakes were made
on everyone's part.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.990
What mistakes? Tell me.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.639
All you need to know is that

41:26.640 --> 41:28.583
your grandfather
loved your mother...

41:28.720 --> 41:29.999
still does, with all his heart.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.943
Anything he did, he did for love.

(SIGHS)

41:46.440 --> 41:47.871
She was our baby.

41:51.080 --> 41:55.469
The Lord's greatest gift must be
to live a life without regrets.

41:58.760 --> 42:00.862

Proof of God's grace is

I'm fine. I miss you.

- I'll send for you as soon as I can.
- <i>Send for me?</i>

We have no place to stay.

We'll stay here till I work it out.

I can't do that.
You don't understand.

46:48.880 --> 46:50.664
Oh, I understand.

Tonight?

You trippin'.

47:26.080 --> 47:27.784
What did you say?

47:27.920 --> 47:32.548
The Reverend's putting on his
Christmas show... "Black Nativity".

Well, count me out.
I don't do church.

Of course, of course. Go, go, go.

your Christmas presents early.

Langston, I know you
have a lot on your mind.

49:41.800 --> 49:45.427
And maybe the last thing you want
to do is hear somebody preaching.

49:47.560 --> 49:50.823
But this is a very important
night for your grandfather.

49:51.480 --> 49:55.187
I know it would mean a lot
to him for you to be there.

50:08.240 --> 50:09.785
I got this, Ma.

- $100 Knicks win the championship.
- I ain't rollin'.

- See you tomorrow.

Last-minute Christmas
shopping? You're late.

50:33.520 --> 50:36.624
What you said, about buying
more than what's in the store?

50:36.800 --> 50:38.311
All it takes is money.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.231
What if I needed a gun?

50:45.440 --> 50:47.588
Meet me here tonight at ten.

A'ight.

50:58.960 --> 51:01.427
There you are. Where were you?

51:01.640 --> 51:03.199
I was looking all over for you.

51:03.200 --> 51:04.426
We don't want to be late.

51:04.960 --> 51:06.903
I was just taking a walk.

51:07.160 --> 51:08.500
A walk?

51:09.240 --> 51:11.799
Well, since you feel like
stretching your legs,

51:11.800 --> 51:14.346
let's walk to church.
It's not that far.

51:17.320 --> 51:22.267
Grandma, what happened to my
father? Is he dead or alive?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.944
Somewhere in between, I expect

51:27.000 --> 51:28.864
The guy at the pawnshop
said he knew him.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.105
Pawnshop? What on earth
were you doing in there?

51:33.240 --> 51:36.025
I was getting a present for my mom.

51:36.160 --> 51:39.469
I told the guy I was your grandson
and he said he knew my father.

51:39.600 --> 51:42.783
A lot of shady people
hang around pawnshops...

51:42.920 --> 51:46.024
that one in particular.
You stay away from there.

51:46.120 --> 51:47.551
You can't tell me what to do.

51:48.360 --> 51:52.465
Listen to me. You're my
grandson and I love you.

do anything for you.

51:55.200 --> 51:58.065

All she has to do is ask.

51:58.200 --> 52:01.304
She won't ask. You know she won't.

52:04.040 --> 52:06.461
It's fine. We'll manage.

52:17.640 --> 52:18.980

52:19.120 --> 52:21.222
This is your granddad's church.
