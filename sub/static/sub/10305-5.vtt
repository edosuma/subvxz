00:01.240 --> 00:05.028
<i>Last time on Married with Children,
there was a death in the family.</i>

00:05.240 --> 00:06.992
Clear!

00:10.440 --> 00:14.069
It's exactly what I feared, Mr. Bundy.
The fuel pump.

00:15.560 --> 00:17.437
Now, unfortunately,
finding a donor pump...

00:17.640 --> 00:19.949
...will be nearly impossible.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.914
There's a rumour that
the fuel pump you need is in Cuba.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.996
Cuba.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.397
Sultry, seductive Cuba.

00:30.640 --> 00:31.834
Unbelievable.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.278
A collector in DÃ¼sseldorf will give us
5 grand for the entire engine.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.795
Oh, no, don't leave me alone.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.073
Drive towards the light, old friend.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.715
Drive towards the light.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.071
Nice turnout, isn't it, Peg?

01:33.760 --> 01:38.788
Well, it's not every day the village idiot
buries his car in the backyard.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.151
I can't believe
we're actually in mourning.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.832
<i>Well, I don't know about you,
but over here it's 3:00 in the afternoon.</i>

01:56.320 --> 01:58.231
Marcy, you're here.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.475
I'm touched.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.319
Well, I'm just glad that eyesore
is finally gone.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.354
Now, if we can just find
someplace to bury your house.

02:06.720 --> 02:10.076
How about the same place
I'm about to bury my foot?

02:10.680 --> 02:13.069
You know, Al, my Mercedes
sends her sympathy.

02:13.280 --> 02:18.195
<i>She wanted to come, but the Bergmans'
Volvo is having a bar mitzvah.</i>

02:19.880 --> 02:23.793
Al, we've had some
great times in this car.

02:24.200 --> 02:28.478
I think my favourite was the time
we tried to run down my ex-wife.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.909
She outran us,
but the Dodge gave it her best shot.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.315
Mrs. Peg Bundy
would now like to say a few words.

02:37.520 --> 02:40.159
Thank you, Peg.

02:41.160 --> 02:45.312
My husband is a moron. Thank you.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.712
That was beautiful, Mama, really.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.878
See how you do
when Oprah checks out.

02:58.880 --> 03:04.034
Twenty-five years ago, a young man
of endless promise was going places.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.273
All he needed
was a way to get there.

03:08.640 --> 03:12.474
He found it on a used-car lot
on Route 12.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.794
And through the years, the journey
had some unexpected turns...

03:17.000 --> 03:19.798
...and some unwanted passengers.

03:21.960 --> 03:25.396
There are several kinds of love.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.478
One kind of love begins with...

03:29.080 --> 03:31.469
...misplaced lust.

03:32.120 --> 03:37.353
And degenerates into a raging hell
of misery and despair.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.156
But I digress.

03:44.280 --> 03:47.158
Then there's the kind of love
that only turns on when asked...

03:47.360 --> 03:49.510
...and performs beautifully.

03:49.760 --> 03:54.515
The kind of love that makes you
feel young when you go for a ride.

03:56.120 --> 04:00.830
Farewell, my sweet chariot of youth.

04:09.640 --> 04:13.679
Don't you think throwing dirt
on the Dodge is a bit redundant?

04:20.120 --> 04:23.669
Why? Why? Why?

04:34.040 --> 04:35.871
Hi, Peg.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.076
I'm gonna plant these on her grave.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.390
You never bring me flowers.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.710
I would if you died.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.114
Hello? Oh, Gunther.

04:57.320 --> 05:00.756
Look, I told you for the last time,
I can't get you that engine.

05:00.960 --> 05:05.238
Yeah, the dummkopf buried it
in the backyard two days ago.

05:05.680 --> 05:10.231
Ten thousand dollars?
On Monday? Deal.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.711
<i>Oh, I gotta go. Auf Wiener schnitzel.</i>

05:14.280 --> 05:16.589
Hey, I want a car that talks.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.439
Look, this one knows 20 words.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.870
That's 10 more than you, Kel.

05:23.040 --> 05:27.431
That's not true, Bud Bundy,
you stupid little...

05:28.080 --> 05:30.355
...pervert.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.833
Dad, you should see
some of these new cars in here.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.996
Ghouls.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.157
Can't you at least wait
until the body is cold?

05:41.360 --> 05:42.554
Come on, Daddy.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.320
Don't you think the Dodge
would want you to be happy?

05:45.520 --> 05:46.555
Yeah, Dad.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.877
I mean, she'd want you to get out there
and see other cars.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.556
Yeah, Al. You know, if I died,
I'd want you to remarry.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.951
Yeah, like I'm gonna
make that mistake twice.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.595
Besides, we can't afford a new car.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.751
Oh, that's not necessarily true, Dad.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.758
I took liberty of giving your records
to a financial advisor.

06:05.960 --> 06:10.909
Now, Bud, you know I don't like people
poking around into my private stuff.

06:11.400 --> 06:15.837
Boy, if I had a nickel for every time
I've heard you say that.

06:17.680 --> 06:18.829
Dad, don't worry.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.396
I gave them to someone
who has your best interest at heart.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.838
Hi, everybody.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.159
Well, Al, I've gone through
your financial records...

06:31.360 --> 06:35.035
<i>...and on behalf of the entire
banking profession, let me just say:</i>

06:40.480 --> 06:43.711
Well, I'm glad I was able to give
your banking buddies a good laugh.

06:43.960 --> 06:48.238
Not just bankers, Al. Everybody down
at the supermarket and the car wash...

06:48.440 --> 06:51.000
...even the homeless guy
that lives on the corner.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.031
Oh, that reminds me.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.834
Sad Willie wanted you to have this.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.235
But don't worry, Al,
I've crunched the numbers...

06:59.440 --> 07:04.070
...and I think I've come up with the
best means of transportation for you.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.832
<i>You missed me, you missed me</i>

07:23.040 --> 07:25.998
<i>I got you, I got you</i>

07:26.800 --> 07:29.473
How dare she tell us
what we can or cannot afford.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.798
It is my God-given American right
to rack up as much debt as possible.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.991
Kids, to the auto mall.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.993
Now, kids, stand back
and watch the old man work.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.158
You know,
sales is the ultimate duel of wits.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.713
Dad's dead.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.552
Howdy. I'm Cal.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.113
Hi, Cal. I'm Al.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.915
Listen, Cal, before you start
your dog-and-pony show...

07:53.120 --> 07:57.557
...you should know that I've been
in ladies' shoes for well over 25 years.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.439
Well, I'm wearing panties,
so let's deal.

08:01.360 --> 08:05.319
No, I meant that I sell ladies' shoes.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.714
I was just pulling your leg.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.873
Well, you're not gonna pull
anything of mine.

08:13.280 --> 08:16.716
Now, look, Cal, all I need here
is basic transportation.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.996
Oh, well, I got just the car for you.

08:19.200 --> 08:23.159
The all-new '97 Kiwi.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.878
Look, Bud, it's perfect for you
and Mrs. Thumb.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.914
It gets great gas mileage.

08:34.159 --> 08:38.073
Yeah, Dad, if you do run out of gas,
just pick it up, take it home.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.597
It's a lot roomier than it looks.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.956
Cal, I'm starting to cramp up here.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.912
Could you get me out of here?

08:46.720 --> 08:47.914
Oh, what was I thinking?

08:48.120 --> 08:51.954
A man of your strapping
muscular physique in a Kiwi.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.189
Hey, did you play pro ball?

08:55.440 --> 08:58.432
Well, I could have,
but I had a career-ending accident.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.069
- Knee?
- Marriage.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.471
No, but I played four years
at Polk High.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.477
"Touchdown" Bundy,
they used to call me.

09:07.720 --> 09:10.553
Polk High's Al Bundy?

09:10.760 --> 09:12.671
You, sir, were my idol.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.714
And because of that, I'm gonna
give you our red-carpet lease.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.712
Now, Cal. Now, wait a minute, now.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.434
No, you're not gonna
sucker me into no lease.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.358
Oh, that's too bad...

09:23.560 --> 09:26.552
...because with a lease,
you could afford...

09:26.760 --> 09:30.753
...the all new Testica 2000.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.870
You know,
with all due respect to the Dodge...

09:44.080 --> 09:46.514
...these brakes sure come in handy.

09:46.840 --> 09:50.230
Yeah, it's nice not having to
throw out the anchor.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.916
And you can choose
which way you're gonna turn.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.838
Now, what do they call
this fancy sound system?

09:58.040 --> 09:59.678
FM.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.760
Man, I can't wait to hear
what the chicks have to say...

10:03.960 --> 10:06.394
...when I pull up in this babe magnet.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.794
<i>Well, my guess would be:</i>

10:08.000 --> 10:12.039
" Hey, look at that pathetic little dweeb
driving his dad's car. "

10:13.760 --> 10:16.069
Al, nice wheels.

10:16.280 --> 10:20.558
But you have to realise,
stealing cars is a felony.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.953
<i>So is pretending to be that kid
on Home Improvement.</i>

10:30.000 --> 10:33.276
Hey, Mrs. D'Arcy,
it has seat warmers.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.074
Really. Feel my tush, it's warm.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.791
I'll take a rain check.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.275
Hey, you better grab it
while you can.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.797
It's her busy season.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.679
No offence, Al...

10:46.880 --> 10:50.919
...but how can a shoe-selling moron
afford a Testica 2000?

10:51.160 --> 10:54.072
Well, your Kentucky friedness...

10:55.440 --> 10:59.069
...I leased it.
Got a real good deal too.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.435
For them.

11:00.640 --> 11:04.394
You signed a 20-year lease
with a balloon payment at the end.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.315
Well, my pal Cal
said that smart people lease.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.869
Yeah, to stupid people.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.031
Oh, she's just jealous, Daddy.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.516
She wishes she had
a shiny red testicle.

11:23.240 --> 11:25.435
That's Testica.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.510
So where's my keys to the car?

11:36.760 --> 11:39.399
I don't even like you
having a key to the house.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.475
Now, go on, get out of here.
You're using up all the new-car smell.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.950
Alone at last.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.358
Who would have thought a punk kid
from the streets of Chicago...

11:52.560 --> 11:55.438
...would wind up
with a beauty like you.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.758
We're gonna live happily ever after.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.030
Don't panic, kids.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.078
Daddy bought a lime.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.912
And he fathered a vegetable.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.989
I think I can fix it,
but I gotta look in the owner's manual.

12:24.240 --> 12:28.279
Why don't you try looking
under X, for exorcism?

12:28.960 --> 12:32.748
I bet you anything he forgot
the seat warmers were stuck on broil.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.953
Good night, Daddy.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.191
Bud, help me.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.953
I would, Dad, but you-

12:43.160 --> 12:46.118
You told me to keep
my hands off your Testica.

12:49.960 --> 12:53.794
<i>I've been working in the backyard</i>

12:54.000 --> 12:57.754
<i>All the livelong day</i>

12:58.000 --> 12:59.911
Hey, Mom.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.473
Oh, hi, kids.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.756
What are you doing there, Mom?

13:05.320 --> 13:07.231
Sleep-shovelling.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.918
Hey, we're not supposed to
wake her up.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.191
Yeah, I know what's going on here.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.913
That dealer in Germany called...

13:17.120 --> 13:19.315
...and upped his offer for the engine,
didn't he?

13:19.520 --> 13:24.116
Hey. Now, either you cut us in
or I'm gonna tell Mom.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.837
- Dad.
- Him too.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.714
You're blackmailing
your own mother?

13:33.280 --> 13:36.113
Oh, kids, I'm so darn proud of you.

13:36.320 --> 13:40.108
There's no way you're getting
your grubby little mitts on my loot.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.276
- Dad.
- Dad.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.432
All right, all right.
Just get in here and start shovelling.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.949
We've got 12 hours
to get that engine to Germany.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.309
Come on.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.914
Damn seat warmers.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.353
Now, folks,
this is a perfect family car.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.993
Put a roof rack on it...

14:06.200 --> 14:09.875
...and this little tyke can ride in style.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.992
Excuse me, Cal, remember me?
Al Bundy.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.317
- Sorry, doesn't ring a bell.
- No-

14:17.520 --> 14:19.875
Touchdown Bundy,
you know, Polk High.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.479
You said I was your idol.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.278
You?

14:23.920 --> 14:25.672
Excuse me, sir, I'm with a customer.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.390
Excuse me, Cal,
but, see, you sold me a lemon.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.670
Oh, that's impossible.

14:32.240 --> 14:35.471
All the hair on my butt's burned off.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.876
I'm telling you, the electrical system
in that car's all messed up.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.317
No problem, sir. That's covered
by the extended-warranty contract.

14:43.560 --> 14:47.792
No, but see, I was too smart to buy
the extended-warranty contract.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.554
Oh, Al, you should have
listened to Cal.

14:50.800 --> 14:51.915
I did listen to you.

14:52.120 --> 14:55.112
Now I've got a worthless Testica!

14:56.120 --> 14:57.439
- Calm down.
- I am calm.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.437
But I'm demanding
you look at my Testica.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.035
If you don't calm yourself,
you'll have to leave.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.158
Well, I'm not leaving here
empty-handed.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.397
Oh, well, I wouldn't think of that.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.198
Now, Cal, I'm telling you,
if you don't give some satisfaction...

15:15.400 --> 15:18.631
...this is gonna be
your panty-wearing head.

16:01.480 --> 16:05.473
Jefferson, my old adversary.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.435
<i>Fidel, mi compadre.</i>

16:08.640 --> 16:09.789
Still with the CIA?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.639
No, no. When I couldn't kill you,
they fired me.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.674
Oh, sorry.
But you still got the moves.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.110
That's what the wife says.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.998
<i>You married the kid
from Home Improvement?</i>

16:30.160 --> 16:32.196
I guess I did.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.914
Oh, well. She's got money,
she buys me things.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.032
So did Russia,
and look what that got us.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.229
<i>El presidente...</i>

16:42.680 --> 16:46.434
...you still have a bunch of old
American cars lying around the island?

16:46.680 --> 16:48.989
Thousands. Damn trade embargo.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.553
Damn Kennedy.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.149
Damn Steve Allen.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.029
What does Steve Allen got to do
with trade embargo?

16:56.280 --> 16:58.589
Nothing. I just hate him.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.755
Listen, I've got a friend,
his name's Al Bundy.

17:01.960 --> 17:05.316
He's got an old Dodge
and he needs a new fuel pump.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.192
May I ask your people's help?

17:07.440 --> 17:09.237
What's in it for me?

17:09.440 --> 17:12.193
America's greatest export.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.627
SnackWell's.

17:13.839 --> 17:17.515
Oh, I've heard about these.

17:20.880 --> 17:25.795
<i>Comrades, mi familia,
I need your help.</i>

17:26.000 --> 17:30.073
There is a man,
Al Bundy is his name.

17:30.280 --> 17:34.478
A poor man, a needy man.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.831
Needier than us?

17:37.040 --> 17:41.477
<i>SÃ­, he's middle-aged
and sells shoes at the mall.</i>

17:44.880 --> 17:47.394
What is a mall?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.431
It's a large group of stores...

17:49.640 --> 17:52.393
...with an endless supply
of affordable merchandise.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.318
And a food court.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.715
We want a mall!

18:00.120 --> 18:02.873
Now you see what you made me do?

18:03.080 --> 18:07.119
Fidel, I can't believe you could have
somebody shot just by doing that.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.798
Oh, no. Dad's home.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.911
Well, stall him.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.430
Hey, Dad.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.750
Damn Testica.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.276
I miss the Dodge.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.558
I think I'll go pay my respect.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.030
No, Dad, Dad. Let it go.

18:32.240 --> 18:36.870
It's just a shell out there.
What's inside has gone up to heaven.

18:39.480 --> 18:42.040
We got it. We found your fuel pump.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.158
You did? You're gonna bring
the Dodge back to life?

18:45.400 --> 18:49.359
I'm a Dodge specialist, not
a miracle worker, but I'll do all I can.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.597
Dad, it's too late. Just accept it.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.190
Now, Mr. Bundy, I need to get to the car
as fast as possible.

18:57.520 --> 19:01.559
Bud, Bud, get your mother
and your sister. Start digging.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.398
Good work.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.675
What is taking so long?

19:12.880 --> 19:14.757
I wish there was something
I could do.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.557
You could take me
to the emergency room.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.280
I'm seeing double.

19:22.720 --> 19:25.837
<i>Here, here, here, here.
Read a Big 'Uns.</i>

19:27.400 --> 19:30.198
Oh, four 'uns.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.830
I can't believe I lost $10,000.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.395
I thought you said it was 7.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.398
Whatever.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.829
Well, Mr. Bundy, I did all I could.

19:45.040 --> 19:47.793
- Now it's up to her to pull through.
- Can I see her?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.788
Of course,
but she may not recognise you.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.035
She's been through a lot, you realise.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.754
Her appearance may shock you.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.995
Doc, you see
what I wake up to each morning.

20:05.040 --> 20:09.397
Now, remember, she'll need plenty
of garage rest and a low-octane diet.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.268
Jefferson, no matter what happens...

20:12.480 --> 20:15.278
...I can never repay you
for what you've done.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.636
Just buy me a six-pack of beer.

20:17.880 --> 20:21.429
Which part of " never repay"
don't you understand?

20:32.120 --> 20:35.396
Mr. Bundy, I'm sorry.

20:35.800 --> 20:36.869
I failed you.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.314
What do you mean, failed?

20:38.520 --> 20:41.637
She hasn't sounded this good
since the day I bought her.

20:41.880 --> 20:46.476
Why? Why? Why?!

20:46.720 --> 20:48.199
I'm so glad you're back.

20:48.400 --> 20:54.350
And I just want you to know,
I never loved that flashy red hussy.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.120
Or the new car either.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.878
Hey, Cal.

21:22.960 --> 21:27.078
Your pal Al
has a little present for you.
