00:54.388 --> 00:57.489
<i>Please tell me,
when did "elite" become a dirty word?</i>

00:58.593 --> 01:00.860
<i>We are proud of you.
Proud of your accomplishments.</i>

01:00.862 --> 01:03.194
<i>Proud of the example
you have set</i>

01:03.196 --> 01:04.797
<i>and perhaps more than anything,</i>

01:04.799 --> 01:07.134
<i>we are proud of your character.</i>

01:13.575 --> 01:16.474
I'm joined here tonight
by some of our best students

01:16.476 --> 01:17.843
and their families.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.181
Hey.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.840
A couple of hours,
I don't know. Don't wait up.

01:47.942 --> 01:50.310
What?

01:53.648 --> 01:55.948
Pablo, yo, can you
do me a favor?

01:55.950 --> 01:58.718
Can you pick up my shift on Saturday?
It's my wife's birthday.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.788
Going to dinner,
splurged on a babysitter.

02:56.844 --> 03:00.513
Holy shit.
Look at this place.

03:00.515 --> 03:03.885
I mean, I heard it was big,
but this is... Jesus.

03:06.319 --> 03:10.556
How many acres does the Lord
Manning preside over anyway?

03:10.558 --> 03:11.592
Pray tell.

03:15.997 --> 03:17.763
You don't know
or you're not interested?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.565
Both.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.366
You have a screening room?

03:21.368 --> 03:22.868
I bet you have a screening room.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.706
You can just
drop me off anywhere.

03:25.506 --> 03:26.806
Right.

03:45.860 --> 03:47.427
Think he'll let me
look at the house?

03:48.361 --> 03:49.362
Bye.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.688
Good morning.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.022
Good morning.

05:23.024 --> 05:25.691
Are you here to pick up
the donation?

05:25.693 --> 05:28.629
Um, no. I think I just
dropped off my donation.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.431
Excuse me?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.636
I'm Shannon's dad.
I just gave her a ride.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.771
I'm Carrie, I'm Jamie's mother.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.471
Nice to meet you.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.608
Drew Hagel, nice to meet you.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.743
"Hagel." I thought that
Shannon said,

05:44.745 --> 05:46.178
- her last name was...
- Dark.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.547
That's her <i>nom de guerre.</i>

05:48.549 --> 05:51.517
Her mother's name.
Also her signature mood.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.685
Is her mother no longer...

05:52.687 --> 05:56.689
No. No, she's somewhere out
in the Pacific Northwest.

05:56.691 --> 05:58.791
Uh... I remarried though,

05:58.793 --> 06:01.560
to a much younger woman.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.564
Kind of a trophy thing.

06:04.599 --> 06:07.499
Hagel, is that any relation
to the Hagels of...

06:07.501 --> 06:09.935
No. Not at all.
No. No relation at all.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.504
I'm Hagel's Real Estate.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.573
Maybe you've seen
my signs in town?

06:14.575 --> 06:16.978
I'm late, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.880
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

06:20.882 --> 06:23.651
- Um...
- We love Shannon.

06:24.185 --> 06:25.720
You've done well.

07:03.658 --> 07:04.692
Hi.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.727
Do you play?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.294
What?

07:08.296 --> 07:10.495
This guy sucks, I need a decent partner.
Do you play tennis?

07:10.497 --> 07:13.766
Uh, I used to, a little.

07:13.768 --> 07:15.200
I need a warrior on my corner.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.869
I can't keep losing to guys
who work for me.

07:16.871 --> 07:17.872
You know?

07:18.272 --> 07:20.005
Do I know you?

07:20.007 --> 07:22.543
I'm Drew Hagel.
I'm Shannon's dad.

07:23.844 --> 07:24.979
Who the hell is that?

07:25.513 --> 07:27.179
Jamie's girlfriend.

07:27.181 --> 07:29.951
Oh. Yeah, hey. Quint.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.052
- Nice to meet you.
- Um...

07:33.054 --> 07:34.620
Well, why don't you go
get suited up, then?

07:34.622 --> 07:35.721
There's some
stuff in the clubhouse.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.224
Oh, okay.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.696
- Thanks.
- You serve, I close!

07:45.299 --> 07:46.701
Play.

07:53.074 --> 07:54.606
That's what I'm talking about.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.876
<i>No. Look, I don't want to
be a sore loser here, all right?</i>

07:57.878 --> 08:00.713
But you hired a ringer, Quint.
The guy's a pro. Come on.

08:00.715 --> 08:03.549
- Were you? A pro.
- What?

08:03.551 --> 08:06.118
No. I'm a broker,
a real estate broker.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.886
Ah, yeah,
but you were something.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.656
In college, I played a little.
Division three.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.591
Heh, so, real estate agent...

08:12.593 --> 08:16.195
I mean, I thought that was a job
for divorced middle-aged housewives.

08:16.197 --> 08:19.298
Sorry. That's just
my lawyer being friendly.

08:19.300 --> 08:22.768
No, my dad said, "Try to do
something that's needed."

08:22.770 --> 08:25.506
I figured, coffins and houses.

08:27.008 --> 08:29.308
Maybe, I took his advice
a little too literally.

08:29.310 --> 08:32.911
Anyways, I, uh...

08:32.913 --> 08:35.147
I think what you guys do
is totally exciting.

08:35.149 --> 08:36.949
It is exciting. It is.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.952
The best part is that no one can
even explain what we do. Right?

08:39.954 --> 08:42.021
We move invisible money
through invisible markets

08:42.023 --> 08:43.589
at invisible speeds,

08:43.591 --> 08:45.991
guided by invisible hands
with invisible oversight.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.793
There's nothing
exciting about that.

08:47.795 --> 08:51.132
Except the 18%.

08:56.270 --> 08:58.572
- All right, see you next Saturday.
- All right.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.608
Can I ask you something?

09:02.610 --> 09:06.011
I, uh, know this might not
be the best time, but...

09:06.013 --> 09:08.680
Yeah, you want to invest
in WMV. I know.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.682
I get it all the time.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.218
Almost every man I meet.
Some women too, actually.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.853
But my world is mostly men.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.656
I was just thinking now
that we know each other,

09:17.658 --> 09:20.059
and the kids make
a really great couple...

09:20.061 --> 09:22.261
Yeah, we're practically family.

09:22.263 --> 09:26.700
Yes, I'd like to make
a small investment in the fund.

09:27.368 --> 09:29.201
Minimum is 300.

09:29.203 --> 09:31.370
- Three hundred thousand?
- Yeah, minimum, so...

09:31.372 --> 09:33.841
- Right.
- And that's just for friends and family.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.775
You know how
a hedge fund works?

09:36.777 --> 09:41.282
Yeah, sure.
I actually minored in economics.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.652
I was just thinking, uh...

09:45.219 --> 09:46.351
Yeah, that would be fine.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.421
I think that nothing ventured,
nothing gained, right?

09:49.423 --> 09:52.157
Yeah. Why don't
you think about it, right?

09:52.159 --> 09:54.359
Talk it over with the wife,
and then if you're still interested,

09:54.361 --> 09:56.163
you can come down
to the Capitol Park office.

09:57.198 --> 09:59.731
- Okay. Thanks.
- All right.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.900
<i>All I'm asking for
is a bridge loan.</i>

10:01.902 --> 10:03.869
Yeah, a big one.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.073
- Take it.
- Just my daughter.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.175
The house is worth it, Andy.
You know it is.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.847
But you renovated last year.
What is this really for?

10:17.318 --> 10:21.386
Look, Andy, I'm, uh...
I'm not gambling anymore,

10:21.388 --> 10:23.288
if that's what
you're insinuating.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.925
- I wasn't.
- I have debts.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.893
Responsibilities.

10:27.895 --> 10:31.096
I mean, I'm not even asking for
a handout for Christ's sake.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.100
I can handle a payment plan.

10:34.135 --> 10:36.969
Buddy, please.

10:36.971 --> 10:39.071
You have no idea,

10:39.073 --> 10:42.209
the opportunity that is
in front of me right now is...

10:43.310 --> 10:45.079
beyond beyond.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.050
Is business still slow?

10:51.819 --> 10:53.218
Let me tell you the story
about the time

10:53.220 --> 10:54.786
my dad asked me
to collect the rent

10:54.788 --> 10:56.355
from that crazy guy on Bayview.

10:56.357 --> 10:58.257
- You did?
- "Beware of the dog."

10:58.259 --> 11:00.325
That's all he tells me,
"Watch out for the dog."

11:00.327 --> 11:02.327
I get to the house,
there's no dog.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.296
So I go back to the front door,
I ring the doorbell,

11:04.298 --> 11:06.499
guy comes down,
hands me an envelope.

11:06.501 --> 11:08.800
Great, no problem.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.235
As I'm heading down
his front steps,

11:10.237 --> 11:14.239
this massive Doberman comes barreling
around the side of the house.

11:14.241 --> 11:17.176
I hightail it up Bayview,
running as fast as I can.

11:17.178 --> 11:19.878
Finally, I get back
to the house but I realize,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.847
I don't have the envelope.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.782
I must have dropped it
on the run.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.785
I go back to Bayview, retrace my
steps, I look everywhere.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.254
Nothing.
I'm crying hysterically.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.490
Finally, my dad gets home.
He calms me down.

11:31.492 --> 11:32.693
He says to me, "Drew...

11:33.528 --> 11:35.896
"Never let money get you down."

11:37.464 --> 11:40.301
Gives me $10, tells me
to go deposit that in the bank.

11:41.769 --> 11:44.403
- Come on.
- How much was in the envelope?

11:44.405 --> 11:46.874
- What?
- What was in the envelope?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.844
I don't know, I never asked.

12:10.464 --> 12:11.799
What happened?

12:13.133 --> 12:14.833
What'd I do?

12:14.835 --> 12:17.269
This is not about you.

12:17.271 --> 12:19.974
Come on,
you're killing me here. What?

12:22.142 --> 12:23.410
I'm pregnant.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.883
Um, sorry, but...

12:31.885 --> 12:35.555
But it is a little bit
about me.

12:35.557 --> 12:38.991
- Unless there's something else...
- No, they're yours, my dear,

12:38.993 --> 12:41.996
and this time it will work out.

12:43.931 --> 12:47.132
Oh, did you...

12:47.134 --> 12:49.136
Did you just say "they"?

12:50.304 --> 12:51.872
There's two of them.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.940
Twins?

12:54.942 --> 12:57.011
Yes.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.146
Okay, this is the part
where you jump up to hug me

13:01.148 --> 13:04.285
and tell me you love me and not
to worry about those miscarriages.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.358
I love you.

13:12.527 --> 13:14.461
- I love you.
- Okay.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.431
Twins?

13:18.499 --> 13:19.900
Mmm-hmm.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.636
We'll make it work.
We always do.

13:23.638 --> 13:26.606
We'll be careful, and cautious,
and frugal.

13:26.608 --> 13:27.808
Yeah.

13:58.339 --> 14:01.106
I thought, uh, Quint
was going to be here.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.575
What do you mean?

14:02.577 --> 14:05.578
Oh. We're friends.

14:05.580 --> 14:07.047
He waited for you.

14:07.716 --> 14:10.182
I was only five minutes late.

14:10.184 --> 14:12.918
Six, max. I'm a zombie
without coffee

14:12.920 --> 14:13.852
so I went down the...

14:13.854 --> 14:16.088
It was scheduled
as a five-minute meeting.

14:16.090 --> 14:17.991
He's leaving for London
in an hour.

14:19.561 --> 14:20.861
Okay.

14:21.663 --> 14:22.928
What's this?

14:22.930 --> 14:24.262
SEC requirements.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.398
Government wants to know you make
at least half a million a year

14:26.400 --> 14:27.968
and have a total net worth
of over five.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.570
Million?

14:30.572 --> 14:32.306
And I'll need it back
by Friday.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.875
Sure. Yeah.

14:52.126 --> 14:53.661
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.595
Are you coming to bed?

14:55.597 --> 14:56.997
Yeah, in a little bit.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.398
What are you doing?

14:59.400 --> 15:00.602
Nothing, just...

15:02.069 --> 15:03.638
- Just working on the closing.
- Oh.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.673
My hero.

15:09.744 --> 15:11.579
- Well, good night.
- Night.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.048
- You need water?
- No, I'm good.

16:12.306 --> 16:15.440
Jesus.

16:15.442 --> 16:18.243
- You scared the shit out of me.
- What's going on, Drew?

16:20.247 --> 16:22.717
- What do you mean?
- I've been trying to get ahold of you.

16:24.586 --> 16:26.351
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.587
Didn't I send you an e-mail?

16:27.589 --> 16:28.754
You've been dodging me
for weeks.

16:28.756 --> 16:29.755
What the hell?

16:29.757 --> 16:31.726
I thought I'd stop by
and save you the call.

16:34.294 --> 16:37.530
Yeah, well, that's, um...

16:37.532 --> 16:41.834
Very generous of you.
Unfortunately, I'm extremely late.

16:41.836 --> 16:43.669
For what?

16:43.671 --> 16:45.472
School thing. A benefit.

16:47.107 --> 16:50.075
Let me go mingle with
a few people, do my thing,

16:50.077 --> 16:51.409
and sort it out tomorrow.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.778
When did you become so crass?

16:52.780 --> 16:54.212
When I borrowed from you.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.681
Not from me. The bank.

16:55.683 --> 16:57.115
Right again.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.052
I saw your SEC forms.

17:01.154 --> 17:04.322
- Look, Andy...
- Why didn't you just tell me?

17:04.324 --> 17:05.858
'Cause you wouldn't have
approved the loan.

17:05.860 --> 17:07.459
So you just decided
to make up the numbers?

17:07.461 --> 17:08.763
You can't do that, Drew.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.598
I just need a little
more time, okay?

17:12.600 --> 17:14.834
I'm working on something
really big,

17:14.836 --> 17:15.801
and I can't talk
about it right now.

17:15.803 --> 17:17.737
That's why I have to go see
Quint tonight.

17:17.739 --> 17:19.739
No, no, you don't understand.
I could lose my job.

17:19.741 --> 17:20.907
You could go to jail.

17:20.909 --> 17:23.609
Falsely reporting on an SEC
file is a serious crime.

17:23.611 --> 17:24.544
Not to mention...

17:24.546 --> 17:26.814
Will you stop being
so dramatic, please?

17:28.650 --> 17:31.316
I'm doing business with Quint
Manning for fuck's sake.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.686
It's gonna work out, all right?

17:33.688 --> 17:36.658
I promise. I just need you
to buy me a little more time.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.560
Please.

17:40.595 --> 17:43.328
For future reference,
return my calls.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.463
- I sent you an...
- Return my calls!

17:45.465 --> 17:46.734
That's all there is to it.

18:55.937 --> 18:57.435
Congratulations, kiddo.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.704
Oh, I didn't win
anything yet.

18:58.706 --> 19:00.673
Don't worry, you will.

19:00.675 --> 19:03.976
Wow, great table! Thanks again
for including us, Quint.

19:03.978 --> 19:06.946
My pleasure. Your wife
might be regretting it.

19:06.948 --> 19:10.482
- Oh?
- We seem to be having a serious disagreement.

19:10.484 --> 19:13.385
Oh, no. I just think there's
too much pressure on these kids.

19:13.387 --> 19:15.688
They're afraid of losing and
disappointing their parents,

19:15.690 --> 19:17.690
and they're afraid of winning
and hurting their friends.

19:17.692 --> 19:20.258
Competition is healthy
by its very nature.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.695
The desire to win
builds character.

19:22.697 --> 19:24.329
You feel like
it's too much, Jamie?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.297
Huh? All this pressure?

19:26.299 --> 19:29.234
It's fine. It doesn't really
matter that much.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.937
All this anxiety, it's palpable.

19:31.939 --> 19:33.471
What are you talking about?

19:33.473 --> 19:34.909
He's cool as a cucumber.

19:35.910 --> 19:37.377
Where's Shannon?

19:38.846 --> 19:40.345
Jamie?

19:40.347 --> 19:41.714
No idea.

19:41.716 --> 19:44.550
I don't mean to offend,
but isn't anxiety very lucrative for you

19:44.552 --> 19:45.787
in your business, Mrs. Hagel?

19:46.988 --> 19:48.921
That's a very cynical way
of looking at it.

19:48.923 --> 19:50.656
You are
a therapist after all,

19:50.658 --> 19:52.925
I mean, human misery
is a profit indicator.

19:52.927 --> 19:55.594
My job is to help
people cope and grow

19:55.596 --> 19:58.496
and deal with deep emotional
and mental challenges.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.965
I don't exploit their condition.

19:59.967 --> 20:01.401
I don't want to see them
as products.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.503
I actually add value
to their lives.

20:04.505 --> 20:05.571
I treat them.

20:05.573 --> 20:07.039
Not for free.

20:07.041 --> 20:11.610
I mean, the mental health industry
is a $30 billion industry, right?

20:11.612 --> 20:12.745
- And it's growing.
- But, I get it,

20:12.747 --> 20:15.681
to you, the people I work with,
they are worth less.

20:15.683 --> 20:17.016
And I'm lower on the totem pole

20:17.018 --> 20:19.585
because I don't exploit them
for my own net worth.

20:19.587 --> 20:21.419
You have to excuse Godeep,

20:21.421 --> 20:25.624
because this mind is only built
for exploitation and maximization.

20:25.626 --> 20:27.492
Hey, not bad for the son of
a single mother

20:27.494 --> 20:29.360
who barely spoke English.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.682
- Mom, what the fuck?
- Don't.

20:49.684 --> 20:51.284
- Traffic?
- Traffic.

20:53.855 --> 20:56.423
Did I miss anything important?

21:10.938 --> 21:13.741
I'd like something
a little quick.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.822
Carrie, when's
the grand opening?

21:29.824 --> 21:32.325
Oh, not for a while.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.997
The renovations get behind...

21:44.806 --> 21:47.006
Will it be run like
a French cinematheque,

21:47.008 --> 21:48.808
or a legit theater?

21:48.810 --> 21:50.077
Not sure.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.679
Hey, Drew,
can you meet tomorrow?

21:53.681 --> 21:56.449
- My house.
- Uh, yeah, sure.

21:57.552 --> 21:59.685
Oh, her majesty.

21:59.687 --> 22:01.821
Hi.

22:01.823 --> 22:04.089
- Look who decided to show up.
- What did I miss?

22:04.091 --> 22:05.791
Death by
classical music.

22:05.793 --> 22:09.595
When did "elite"
become such a dirty word?

22:10.665 --> 22:12.565
For the past 96 years,

22:12.567 --> 22:15.100
the Hilton Award
for Academic Excellence

22:15.102 --> 22:18.704
has been given
to brilliant Buckford students.

22:18.706 --> 22:22.775
Students who exemplify both
the moral and academic standard

22:22.777 --> 22:25.578
that we aspire to uphold.

22:25.580 --> 22:27.913
This is for a student
who goes beyond,

22:27.915 --> 22:30.149
who is a compassionate leader,

22:30.151 --> 22:32.887
an empathetic, intelligent
young person.

22:35.890 --> 22:40.528
And the Oscar goes to...

22:41.729 --> 22:43.428
That's the one that kills
every year.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.830
Okay,
something's wrong.

22:44.832 --> 22:48.100
You all right?

22:49.503 --> 22:52.905
- Do you need help, ma'am?
- Can you please help us get to the car?

22:52.907 --> 22:54.874
- Dad, do you want me to come?
- Something's really wrong.

22:54.876 --> 22:56.942
Excuse me. Sorry.

22:56.944 --> 22:58.744
- Can you get that door?
- I got it.

22:58.746 --> 23:02.480
- I'm so sorry.
- You let us know if you need anything.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.683
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

23:04.685 --> 23:07.487
Why don't we all take a seat?

23:09.456 --> 23:11.959
- You drive my car home, please?
- Don't leave her alone.

23:13.694 --> 23:17.029
Thank you, everyone,
she's... She's fine, thank you.

23:17.031 --> 23:20.801
Look at the fuckin'
arrogance of these guys.

23:21.769 --> 23:24.603
Doctors, you know.

23:28.676 --> 23:29.909
You all right?

23:29.911 --> 23:31.877
- Yeah.
- You sure?

23:31.879 --> 23:33.413
Yeah.

23:35.082 --> 23:36.483
Look at me.

23:37.518 --> 23:39.251
It's gonna be okay.

23:39.253 --> 23:41.188
- All right?
- Mmm-hmm.

23:44.058 --> 23:45.893
Trust me, I know my boys.

23:47.728 --> 23:52.800
No Hagel has ever shown up
for anything or anyone early.

23:53.768 --> 23:55.202
Just doesn't happen.

24:36.877 --> 24:39.178
- Hey, I thought we were...
- Hey. Yeah, listen...

24:39.180 --> 24:41.080
I'm just gonna cut to the
chase, I don't have much time.

24:41.082 --> 24:44.683
Essentially the markets are proving
more volatile than we anticipated.

24:44.685 --> 24:48.187
So nearly everywhere we're
positioned is ripping higher.

24:48.189 --> 24:50.689
- That's a good thing, right?
- No. No, um...

24:50.691 --> 24:52.658
Our short positions are
moving against us.

24:52.660 --> 24:54.261
We're counting on these
positions to fail.

24:55.997 --> 24:58.998
Yeah, well, I'm sure
in time, they'll...

24:59.000 --> 25:02.668
No, what I'm telling you is
that your investment in the fund

25:02.670 --> 25:05.039
has gone down, substantially.

25:05.473 --> 25:07.072
"Substantially"?

25:07.074 --> 25:09.610
Yeah, right now
it's about 90% devaluation.

25:13.247 --> 25:16.081
Oh, so, um...

25:16.083 --> 25:20.953
So, that means I have
$30,000 left out of the...

25:20.955 --> 25:25.724
Oh, no. Look, the numbers
are meaningless, okay?

25:25.726 --> 25:28.929
So I'm just letting you know that right
now would be a bad time to pull out.

25:36.037 --> 25:40.039
But your business
is solid, right, Drew?

25:40.041 --> 25:41.776
I don't need
to worry about you. Right?

25:42.910 --> 25:44.643
Hey, Drew, buddy.

25:44.645 --> 25:46.714
You're solid, right?

25:49.050 --> 25:51.116
Yeah. Yeah, I'm, uh...

25:51.118 --> 25:53.220
Um, solid.

25:56.357 --> 25:57.825
How's the missus?

25:58.392 --> 26:00.726
- What?
- Your wife.

26:00.728 --> 26:02.895
- My wife?
- Yeah.

26:02.897 --> 26:04.799
Carrie mentioned
it was a false alarm.

26:07.935 --> 26:11.303
You don't even know her name,
do you? My wife.

26:11.305 --> 26:13.806
Don't be silly.
I gotta go back in.

26:13.808 --> 26:15.841
You give her my best.

26:15.843 --> 26:17.810
What is it, Quint?
Go ahead.

26:17.812 --> 26:19.411
You know it, you say it,
what's her name?

26:19.413 --> 26:22.314
Her name's Ronnie.
Just calm the fuck down.

26:22.316 --> 26:25.119
Okay? And next time,
call before you just show up.

26:26.153 --> 26:27.822
Now get the fuck off
my property.

26:57.852 --> 26:59.186
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

27:00.087 --> 27:01.122
Huh?

27:02.756 --> 27:04.957
Waiting for your meeting
to be over.

27:04.959 --> 27:06.093
To what end?

27:09.230 --> 27:10.898
I'm not built for this, Quint.

27:11.799 --> 27:12.967
Mentally.

27:14.135 --> 27:16.370
I'm not like you.
I need that money back.

27:18.873 --> 27:21.275
- No one has to know.
- You said you could afford it.

27:24.879 --> 27:27.079
I lied.

27:27.081 --> 27:31.083
I know, I screwed up. I'm an idiot.
I failed Economics,

27:31.085 --> 27:34.086
I used to gamble a lot...

27:34.088 --> 27:36.889
Please, I'm not asking
for more than I put in,

27:36.891 --> 27:39.992
but I gotta have it back.
I have Shannon's tuition...

27:39.994 --> 27:41.426
It isn't a game, Drew.

27:41.428 --> 27:42.562
It doesn't
work like that.

27:42.564 --> 27:45.330
It is a game... It is to you,
it is a fucking game!

27:45.332 --> 27:47.933
Come on...

27:47.935 --> 27:50.503
You... It's a fucking fart
to you, Quint.

27:50.505 --> 27:52.037
You make that money
in a week,

27:52.039 --> 27:54.441
a day... I'm gonna lose
my fuckin' house!

27:57.111 --> 27:58.112
Jesus.

27:58.913 --> 28:01.313
Let me sell you
my portion, okay?

28:01.315 --> 28:04.816
Let me sell you my portion,
and I'm...

28:04.818 --> 28:07.286
Face value, and when
the profits come in,

28:07.288 --> 28:09.924
they're all yours.
That's a good deal, right?

28:11.025 --> 28:13.160
You didn't read the terms, hmm?

28:14.261 --> 28:16.395
Yeah, yeah, I read the terms.

28:16.397 --> 28:19.231
You lied on the SEC forms,
didn't you?

28:19.233 --> 28:20.899
You borrowed money
from the bank.

28:20.901 --> 28:22.267
Please, don't do this. Please,

28:22.269 --> 28:23.936
it's humiliating enough
as it is,

28:23.938 --> 28:26.073
I just...

28:27.074 --> 28:30.909
I need the money back, Quint.

28:30.911 --> 28:34.448
Not what's left.
My original investment, please.

28:41.556 --> 28:42.890
Just leave.

28:55.169 --> 28:58.403
...to evacuate the cyclist who is
currently stable but in critical condition

28:58.405 --> 29:00.105
at Orenville Hospital.

29:00.107 --> 29:02.042
An eyewitness...

29:34.542 --> 29:37.476
Sorry, I didn't mean
to wake you up.

29:37.478 --> 29:39.547
Hmm. That's okay.

29:47.054 --> 29:49.056
The ultrasound was all normal.

29:51.626 --> 29:52.893
Great.

29:54.529 --> 29:56.163
He might put me on bed rest.

30:00.167 --> 30:02.202
Did you see Shannon at Jamie's?

30:04.471 --> 30:05.472
No.

30:16.483 --> 30:17.851
Are you okay?

30:19.119 --> 30:20.220
Huh?

30:21.288 --> 30:22.557
Are you okay?

30:24.024 --> 30:25.525
Yeah.

30:25.527 --> 30:27.993
Just tired.

30:27.995 --> 30:31.363
Hey. Hey, where were you last night?

30:31.365 --> 30:33.499
- I'm sorry.
- Didn't I tell you to drive my car?

30:33.501 --> 30:34.902
Yeah, you did.

30:35.603 --> 30:39.137
Hey, Shannon...

30:39.139 --> 30:42.474
I had to take Ronnie to the
doctor's this morning, did you know?

30:42.476 --> 30:44.644
- Knock.
- Sorry.

30:44.646 --> 30:46.581
- What do you want?
- What's going on?

30:47.649 --> 30:48.916
Nothing.

30:50.585 --> 30:52.117
Where were you?

30:52.119 --> 30:53.686
Huh?

30:53.688 --> 30:56.388
Why didn't you call me?
I needed the car.

30:56.390 --> 30:57.690
How come you don't tell me
anything anymore?

30:57.692 --> 30:59.460
- I'm late.
- For what?

31:00.494 --> 31:04.865
What are you late for?
Shannon. What's going on?

31:12.940 --> 31:15.974
<i>...police are still
searching for the driver of a vehicle</i>

31:15.976 --> 31:20.245
<i>that struck a bicyclist,
Mr. Roberto Jarvis, last week.</i>

31:20.247 --> 31:21.649
<i>Mr. Jarvis...</i>

31:38.533 --> 31:40.535
- What are you doing here?
- I came to talk.

31:42.637 --> 31:45.170
I don't know why they're here.

31:45.172 --> 31:48.273
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Excuse me.

31:48.275 --> 31:49.977
We're looking for
Ms. Shannon Hagel.

31:55.382 --> 31:57.182
- Shannon?
- Mmm-hmm.

31:57.184 --> 32:00.485
- What's this about?
- It's a police matter.

33:06.053 --> 33:08.420
We love Shannon.
Great girl.

33:08.422 --> 33:10.357
- Thank you.
- You did well.

33:14.228 --> 33:16.261
Strange person.

33:32.479 --> 33:34.212
Good morning, Gaye.

33:34.214 --> 33:35.650
All right. Thank you.

33:36.450 --> 33:38.350
I hope you're well.

33:38.352 --> 33:40.820
I hate Florida.
It's so chilly.

33:44.224 --> 33:47.060
We're not in Florida, Mom.
We're in New York.

33:50.698 --> 33:52.232
You're having a rough day.

34:15.155 --> 34:16.454
Going away somewhere?

34:16.456 --> 34:18.726
No. No plans.

34:58.231 --> 35:00.566
Excuse me? Hi.

35:00.568 --> 35:03.270
- Excuse me.
- What are they doing to the place?

35:04.271 --> 35:05.938
Abandoning it.

35:05.940 --> 35:07.372
Are you the engineer?

35:07.374 --> 35:10.676
No. My family owns
the property.

35:10.678 --> 35:12.279
My grandfather built it.

35:12.947 --> 35:14.780
My father managed it.

35:14.782 --> 35:18.352
- You're selling it?
- No, just leaving it the way it is.

35:19.186 --> 35:21.789
Can't afford
to fix it up.

35:22.422 --> 35:25.658
- It's not safe.
- What is?

35:25.660 --> 35:28.293
Uh, here you go.

35:28.295 --> 35:30.630
I mean, it'll mess up your hair,
but...

35:30.632 --> 35:32.232
I'll take my chances.

35:35.235 --> 35:37.402
Such a shame.

35:37.404 --> 35:39.540
Eh, I know.

35:41.308 --> 35:43.711
I grew up sneaking into
theaters like this.

35:54.388 --> 35:55.657
Oh, here...

36:01.996 --> 36:04.464
Ladies and gentlemen.

36:06.934 --> 36:11.436
Tonight's screening will be
of the 1945 classic...

36:11.438 --> 36:13.407
Oh, hey watch your step.

36:15.610 --> 36:18.443
I wanna buy it.

36:18.445 --> 36:21.281
Forget it. I told you,
it's falling apart.

36:22.850 --> 36:24.617
What do you say, darling?

36:24.619 --> 36:27.252
- "The Garden Theater."
- It's not bad.

36:29.624 --> 36:31.624
But it's show business,
you know?

36:31.626 --> 36:34.660
No, it's an art center.

36:34.662 --> 36:38.698
It's a cinema, with a stage big
enough for theatrical production.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.331
It's just not the kind of
business I do.

36:40.333 --> 36:43.401
Now, I'm not saying that
we can't move forward.

36:43.403 --> 36:45.738
But I don't think that
it should be a company thing.

36:45.740 --> 36:47.773
I'll talk it over
with Godeep.

36:47.775 --> 36:49.909
Hon, no, it doesn't have
to be a company thing.

36:49.911 --> 36:51.612
We can do it ourselves.

36:53.681 --> 36:55.315
No, I don't think so.

36:56.651 --> 36:58.283
I'm sorry.

36:58.285 --> 37:02.888
No, hey, listen. Babe,
there's a right way to do it.

37:02.890 --> 37:05.725
The company creates
a foundation.

37:05.727 --> 37:07.760
Right? A not-for-profit
organization,

37:07.762 --> 37:10.796
We get a board of directors,
and then we take a tax credit.

37:10.798 --> 37:12.397
- That's the right way.
- We can do that?

37:12.399 --> 37:14.800
Yeah.

37:14.802 --> 37:18.303
If you want it so bad,
of course.

37:18.305 --> 37:20.371
And we tear it down
and build something beautiful.

37:20.373 --> 37:22.373
No. No, I want it exactly
the way it is.

37:22.375 --> 37:24.009
And I promised the owner
that I'd preserve

37:24.011 --> 37:25.644
the integrity of the building.

37:25.646 --> 37:27.680
What? Why the hell
did you do that?

37:27.682 --> 37:31.349
Because preservation
is culture.

37:31.351 --> 37:34.787
No, preservation is the
opposite of progress. Literally.

37:34.789 --> 37:38.991
Kids are growing up with tech
and the attention span of ants.

37:38.993 --> 37:41.761
Ants are incredibly patient

37:41.763 --> 37:43.796
and they have these
storage mechanisms,

37:43.798 --> 37:45.998
these elaborate mechanisms
to find food.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.068
- It's true.
- You know what I mean.

37:49.070 --> 37:51.570
You're such a show-off.

37:51.572 --> 37:54.807
Kids have never seen
<i>Singin' In The Rain,</i>

37:54.809 --> 37:57.612
they've never seen
<i>The Red Shoes.</i>

38:00.014 --> 38:03.381
It could really be
a legacy gift.

38:03.383 --> 38:05.686
Not just for me,
it could be for the town.

38:06.788 --> 38:08.055
For the kids.

38:09.557 --> 38:11.025
- Mmm.
- Ah.

38:14.128 --> 38:16.562
You're such a hothead.

38:24.005 --> 38:26.939
You know I have a business
meeting in the morning.

38:26.941 --> 38:28.042
- No.
- Yeah.

38:31.078 --> 38:33.514
Okay. Night.

38:40.721 --> 38:44.757
Is this a movie theater
or a theater-theater?

38:44.759 --> 38:48.426
Well, it's both.
It's a cultural center.

38:48.428 --> 38:52.998
We'll have plays and movies in
rep, and we're going to have

38:53.000 --> 38:56.168
out-of-town productions,
we could have guest lecturers.

38:56.170 --> 39:00.039
Uh, we could even have our own
artistic residency someday.

39:00.041 --> 39:02.741
The space itself
is really quite beautiful.

39:02.743 --> 39:04.076
It's simple, it's elegant,

39:04.078 --> 39:06.812
it's historical,
completely paid for.

39:06.814 --> 39:10.749
- Mmm-hmm.
- You can really see the potential,

39:10.751 --> 39:12.718
once we renovate, I mean.

39:12.720 --> 39:16.454
But the, uh...
The business model, moving forward,

39:16.456 --> 39:20.092
is gonna have to show a lot more
than just potential.

39:20.094 --> 39:23.195
I think it's a beautiful thing
that you're doing, Mrs. Manning,

39:23.197 --> 39:28.701
and I just want to say this is very
exciting, uh, for all of us on the board

39:28.703 --> 39:33.541
and, um, I'm just honored
to be here at the table.

39:34.775 --> 39:36.677
<i>Thank you,
once again.</i>

39:42.717 --> 39:44.817
That was interesting.

39:44.819 --> 39:46.118
Well, if you've stayed behind
to tell me

39:46.120 --> 39:48.721
that I'm in way over my head,
don't bother.

39:48.723 --> 39:49.788
I already know.

39:49.790 --> 39:51.657
No.

39:51.659 --> 39:54.059
That wasn't what
I wanted to talk about.

39:54.061 --> 39:57.029
Oh, do you wanna go back inside?

39:57.031 --> 39:59.732
I had you all wrong,
I thought it had something to do

39:59.734 --> 40:01.869
with <i>The Killer's Devil Garden.</i>

40:03.938 --> 40:06.707
That was you... wasn't it?

40:08.509 --> 40:13.112
Uh, I'm a bit of...

40:13.114 --> 40:17.116
a horror film fanatic,
it's one of my many contradictions.

40:17.118 --> 40:19.818
You were... You were great.

40:19.820 --> 40:21.687
Mmm-hmm.

40:21.689 --> 40:24.123
I can't believe that anyone
has seen those movies.

40:24.125 --> 40:27.126
They're so bad.
They're still available?

40:27.128 --> 40:30.129
There's a lot of great actors
that started in horror.

40:30.131 --> 40:33.668
I was never a great actor,
if you can call what I was doing "acting."

40:34.902 --> 40:37.104
You're still a great actress.

40:39.907 --> 40:42.107
I haven't acted in forever.

40:42.109 --> 40:43.644
I mean in your life.

40:45.246 --> 40:48.147
- You're a Brooklyn girl.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:48.149 --> 40:51.517
And you came
from nothing, right?

40:51.519 --> 40:55.688
I'm sure that you're not the same
person that you were 20 years ago?

40:55.690 --> 40:59.858
Yes. I'm the same
pathetic teenager.

40:59.860 --> 41:02.594
I mean, I don't spend my Saturday
nights in my parents' basement

41:02.596 --> 41:04.096
- watching B movies.
- No?

41:04.098 --> 41:07.101
No, but...

41:08.936 --> 41:10.137
Basically...

41:13.641 --> 41:16.308
I should go.

41:16.310 --> 41:19.545
I'm a professor, for Christ sake.
I'm supposed to be good at this.

41:19.547 --> 41:21.914
Don't be so hard on yourself.

41:21.916 --> 41:24.118
Uh, I'm flattered
that you know me.

41:28.622 --> 41:30.189
I would like to be considered

41:30.191 --> 41:32.191
for the
Artistic Director position,

41:32.193 --> 41:33.192
don't say anything.

41:33.194 --> 41:35.529
I know I haven't made
much of an impression.

41:38.165 --> 41:40.001
I look forward
to working together.

41:40.901 --> 41:42.003
Yeah.

41:43.571 --> 41:45.671
Me too.

41:45.673 --> 41:47.775
I'll just let myself out.

42:14.668 --> 42:16.769
I can't find my car keys.

42:16.771 --> 42:18.971
What did you wear last night?

42:18.973 --> 42:20.608
They're not in my pocket.

42:23.110 --> 42:25.644
- You hide them all the time.
- No, we don't.

42:25.646 --> 42:27.312
You shut up, you creep.

42:27.314 --> 42:30.282
Stop it.

42:30.284 --> 42:32.818
You're just nervous
about tonight.

42:32.820 --> 42:34.887
- It's normal.
- You don't know shit.

42:34.889 --> 42:36.991
- He said, "shit"!
- Can we say it too?

42:38.159 --> 42:39.593
I'll help you find the key.

42:40.861 --> 42:42.861
I'm not gonna
get that award tonight.

42:42.863 --> 42:43.762
You don't know that.

42:43.764 --> 42:46.031
I can feel it.
Everyone's saying I am.

42:46.033 --> 42:47.332
I'm not. I don't believe it.

42:47.334 --> 42:48.602
It doesn't matter to me.

42:49.236 --> 42:50.636
Well, it matters to Dad.

42:50.638 --> 42:54.940
Dad will deal with whatever,
and he loves you either way.

42:54.942 --> 42:56.708
That's bullshit.

42:56.710 --> 42:59.344
- He said "bullshit."
- Can we say "bullshit" too?

42:59.346 --> 43:01.248
- No.
- Ugh.

43:04.852 --> 43:06.821
That's the surprise.

43:07.988 --> 43:10.355
Where did you get this?

43:10.357 --> 43:12.159
I thought you might
wanna watch it.

43:14.061 --> 43:15.994
Tonight.

43:15.996 --> 43:20.201
I have my son's
fundraiser at his school tonight.

43:21.135 --> 43:22.301
Oh.

43:22.303 --> 43:26.238
Three affairs in 20 years,
I don't think that's so bad.

43:26.240 --> 43:28.709
Mmm. And you're still with him.

43:30.878 --> 43:32.079
What's that about?

43:34.014 --> 43:38.217
When it comes to sex,
I'm more like a man.

43:38.219 --> 43:40.419
I know the difference
between love and pleasure.

43:40.421 --> 43:41.889
Hmm.

43:44.859 --> 43:49.230
And, have you? Ever had one?

43:52.933 --> 43:57.269
Uh, affairs? Yes, yeah.

43:57.271 --> 43:59.037
I have one every day.

43:59.039 --> 44:01.707
Hmm.

44:01.709 --> 44:04.678
- But I don't act on them.
- Why is that?

44:06.280 --> 44:09.750
It's just,
that's the natural order of things.

44:11.952 --> 44:14.321
You like things
the way they are.

44:15.823 --> 44:17.124
You like being rich.

44:18.726 --> 44:20.826
Being taken care of.

44:20.828 --> 44:22.696
Being married to it all.

44:23.831 --> 44:25.998
Don't wanna risk it.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.768
You let him be
the powerful one...

44:29.770 --> 44:31.739
with all his lies.

44:38.513 --> 44:41.246
Wait, I hope... I hope he wins
that fucking award.

44:41.248 --> 44:42.349
Wouldn't that be great?

44:44.251 --> 44:45.753
By the way, Carr?

44:46.521 --> 44:49.321
Uh, something's come up,

44:49.323 --> 44:52.525
I'll be going to New York
after the event.

44:52.527 --> 44:56.161
I went down to the theater,
I met with the artistic director.

44:56.163 --> 44:59.965
- Who?
- The artistic director.

44:59.967 --> 45:02.736
- Had a little bit of wine at lunch.
- Honestly, Carr...

45:04.104 --> 45:06.138
I'm just not sure
it's such a good idea.

45:06.140 --> 45:07.973
Oh, why? He's a great guy.

45:07.975 --> 45:09.341
He's all business.

45:09.343 --> 45:13.045
- Who?
- The artistic director.

45:13.047 --> 45:16.081
No, I was talking about
that theater.

45:16.083 --> 45:18.919
So who's this guy
that you had drinks with?

45:21.121 --> 45:22.389
What are you talking about?

45:23.791 --> 45:27.061
You said that the theater
isn't a good idea?

45:30.197 --> 45:33.033
Godeep says the restoration is
going to have to wait, so...

45:35.202 --> 45:38.103
Well, for how long?
Why didn't he tell me?

45:38.105 --> 45:39.304
He's on my board.

45:39.306 --> 45:41.574
Mmm-hmm, well, he's my lawyer.

45:41.576 --> 45:43.442
But I'm running the foundation.

45:43.444 --> 45:45.177
Okay.
Can we talk about this later?

45:45.179 --> 45:48.113
- What are you doing to me, Quint?
- What am I doing to you?

45:48.115 --> 45:49.448
You're selling it, aren't you?

45:49.450 --> 45:50.550
I didn't say that.

45:50.552 --> 45:52.884
No, you don't have to.
You're hiding behind Godeep.

45:52.886 --> 45:54.121
You're putting it
on the market.

46:04.532 --> 46:05.533
Babe.

46:08.503 --> 46:10.235
It's a bad time for the fund.

46:10.237 --> 46:11.604
The PNL is taking big hits.

46:11.606 --> 46:13.573
I'm going to have to lay off
some staff, and...

46:13.575 --> 46:15.974
I can't guarantee
to my investors

46:15.976 --> 46:17.409
that they won't lose everything,

46:17.411 --> 46:19.878
so extraneous projects
have to go.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.280
The land is worth more
than we paid for.

46:21.282 --> 46:22.515
More than we knew.

46:22.517 --> 46:24.850
We have to get liquid and fast.

46:24.852 --> 46:28.320
So, yes, I will take a decent
offer, no matter what it is.

46:28.322 --> 46:29.388
You're such
an unbelievable asshole.

46:29.390 --> 46:30.789
We'll find something else
for you to do. I'm sorry,

46:30.791 --> 46:33.392
but we need the cash.
The company needs the cash. It's tricky.

46:33.394 --> 46:36.261
You're a fucking
selfish asshole.

46:36.263 --> 46:37.329
Why don't you put
the street girl

46:37.331 --> 46:38.531
back in the wine bottle, okay?

46:38.533 --> 46:41.033
I said I was sorry.
We all have to make sacrifices.

46:41.035 --> 46:43.603
Fucking ass of a fucking ass
of a fucking asshole.

46:43.605 --> 46:45.505
You know what,
you do your thing.

46:45.507 --> 46:48.876
And thank you for being such an
understanding and supportive wife.

46:49.276 --> 46:50.208
Again.

46:50.210 --> 46:52.010
Better start looking
for your next wife.

46:52.012 --> 46:53.178
Oh, I'm on it.

47:11.965 --> 47:15.469
- Mom, what the fuck?
- Don't, do you hear me?

47:21.975 --> 47:24.142
I'll be back by lunch tomorrow.

47:24.144 --> 47:27.179
We can talk then, all right?
I promise.

47:27.181 --> 47:30.315
And you, Carrie,
when's the grand opening?

47:30.317 --> 47:32.386
Not for a while.

47:33.220 --> 47:34.587
Renovations are slow.

47:34.589 --> 47:38.423
Will it be run like a French
cinematheque, or a legit theater?

47:38.425 --> 47:40.127
Not sure.

47:44.666 --> 47:47.067
Do you need help, ma'am?

47:48.035 --> 47:49.236
Can you get that door?

47:51.405 --> 47:53.639
Excuse me, can you drive
my car back, please?

47:53.641 --> 47:55.209
I'm gonna take my car.

47:56.243 --> 47:57.209
Don't leave her alone.

47:57.211 --> 47:58.644
- Okay, okay.
- Don't worry about it.

47:58.646 --> 48:00.648
Thanks, everyone,
she's gonna be fine.

48:01.549 --> 48:04.684
I told you not to invite them.

48:04.686 --> 48:10.155
- My God.
- Once again, without further ado...

48:10.157 --> 48:13.258
The winner of
the distinguished Hilton Award

48:13.260 --> 48:16.463
for Academic Excellence
and Character is...

48:17.965 --> 48:19.133
Brendon Green.

48:32.179 --> 48:33.648
Yeah.

48:41.121 --> 48:45.056
Uh, wow.

48:45.058 --> 48:48.328
Clearly, I'm not the only one
who deserves this.

48:50.998 --> 48:53.333
But I'll take it.

49:03.778 --> 49:06.648
All right...

49:25.800 --> 49:27.034
You wanna fuck?

49:28.302 --> 49:31.571
- Here?
- Yeah. Yes.

49:31.573 --> 49:36.509
The kids are asleep,
and Jamie's out at a party, and...

49:36.511 --> 49:39.812
Quint is hopefully getting

49:39.814 --> 49:42.047
in a fucking car crash
on the Taconic.

49:42.049 --> 49:43.651
It's a perfect time.

50:02.537 --> 50:05.239
- Mmm.
- Mmm?

50:06.206 --> 50:08.610
Oh, God.

50:15.449 --> 50:17.785
- You okay?
- Yeah.

50:20.153 --> 50:21.821
- No...
- You're drunk, let me...

50:21.823 --> 50:24.322
- I'm fine.
- Okay, how much did you drink?

50:24.324 --> 50:26.091
I want to talk to Dad.

50:26.093 --> 50:30.262
- He's in the city.
- I'm not his bitch.

50:30.264 --> 50:32.466
Okay, look, let's go inside.

50:33.300 --> 50:36.201
Dad's gonna hate me.

50:36.203 --> 50:37.637
We're gonna move the car...

50:37.639 --> 50:41.208
I think, um...
I think I don't like girls.

50:42.877 --> 50:45.410
There are much nicer girls
than Shannon.

50:45.412 --> 50:49.416
No, I mean,
I think I like boys.

50:50.217 --> 50:52.219
Oh, okay.

50:58.760 --> 51:02.595
- You sleep it off.
- I can't sleep off being gay.

51:02.597 --> 51:06.466
Sleep off the drink, and the rest...

51:07.835 --> 51:09.336
The rest, you know...

51:10.270 --> 51:12.170
We love you no matter what.

51:12.172 --> 51:13.675
Dad does not.

51:16.744 --> 51:18.345
We'll teach him.

51:38.265 --> 51:39.865
What happened?

51:39.867 --> 51:42.704
What happened in New York?
You look terrible.

51:51.311 --> 51:53.813
So everyone's downstairs in the
office trying to figure things out,

51:53.815 --> 51:57.150
but it looks we're going to have to
sell some assets to stay in the game.

52:01.321 --> 52:02.690
What kind of assets?

52:05.192 --> 52:07.227
Don't worry about it.

52:08.796 --> 52:10.732
I'm not gonna stop spoiling you.

52:33.588 --> 52:35.621
<i>The eyewitness
account identifies the vehicle</i>

52:35.623 --> 52:37.923
<i>as a silver or gray SUV.</i>

52:37.925 --> 52:40.458
<i>The search for that motorist
is ongoing.</i>

52:40.460 --> 52:42.962
<i>Police Chief Harris will be
scheduling a press conference</i>

52:42.964 --> 52:44.599
<i>for tomorrow afternoon.</i>

52:51.739 --> 52:54.707
Thanks. I'm sorry
to be such a royal pain.

52:54.709 --> 52:56.711
Hold on, I'll call you back.

52:57.779 --> 52:59.212
Did you drive drunk last night?

53:00.014 --> 53:01.514
It's none of your business.

53:01.516 --> 53:03.783
Your funeral is my business.

53:03.785 --> 53:05.785
Shannon drove me in her car.

53:05.787 --> 53:07.485
So, how did your car get here?

53:07.487 --> 53:09.691
Someone drove it back
from the party.

53:09.924 --> 53:11.456
Who?

53:11.458 --> 53:12.492
I don't know.

53:13.460 --> 53:14.627
Which party was it?

53:14.629 --> 53:17.464
The last one at Tim's.
The usual.

53:19.567 --> 53:21.667
Maybe the Jeep drove itself.

53:21.669 --> 53:23.571
I don't think
the Jeep drove itself.

53:26.339 --> 53:28.339
- I saw.
- What?

53:28.341 --> 53:33.344
I saw, you were making out
with some doofus.

53:33.346 --> 53:36.281
- What are you talking about?
- Why are you fucking somebody else?

53:36.283 --> 53:38.684
I don't know what you're talking
about, you were really drunk.

53:38.686 --> 53:39.754
You were really slutty.

53:45.993 --> 53:48.426
<i>We have a witness,</i>

53:48.428 --> 53:49.762
who saw a Jeep
similar to yours.

53:49.764 --> 53:52.832
We have the scratch
on the front of your car.

53:52.834 --> 53:56.001
Now, we're not saying
any of this is conclusive.

53:56.003 --> 53:58.472
Lord knows people see all kinds
of things in the dark, but...

53:59.941 --> 54:02.643
We're also not ready
to just say it's a coincidence.

54:05.312 --> 54:08.313
Jamie, you do understand
that all this is very serious, right?

54:08.315 --> 54:09.715
That a man
may lose his life?

54:09.717 --> 54:12.450
Jamie will cooperate fully and
completely with the investigation.

54:12.452 --> 54:15.087
- I did not drive the car.
- Who did?

54:15.089 --> 54:17.625
Quint, they're asking
the questions, not you.

54:19.459 --> 54:24.031
I gave the key to someone.
I don't remember who.

54:24.999 --> 54:27.500
It was at Tim Casey's party.

54:27.502 --> 54:29.668
Well, was it Tim
you gave the keys to,

54:29.670 --> 54:31.369
or somebody at his party?

54:31.371 --> 54:34.341
That's, like,
all that I remember.

54:50.758 --> 54:52.658
Mmm, shall we?

54:52.660 --> 54:53.694
Okay.

54:56.531 --> 55:00.968
This is like the easiest breakup
in the history of breakups.

55:05.807 --> 55:09.577
Yeah, we're still friends.
And, anyway, you're so gay.

55:11.979 --> 55:13.478
Um, um...

55:13.480 --> 55:15.981
My mom will be bummed
when she finds out.

55:15.983 --> 55:17.850
She doesn't
even know me.

55:17.852 --> 55:20.519
No...
No, that girls think I'm gay.

55:20.521 --> 55:21.587
Because you are.

55:21.589 --> 55:24.156
I'm not. I just don't
think about it that much.

55:24.158 --> 55:27.026
Trust me. You are.

55:27.028 --> 55:28.896
Labels are stupid anyway.

55:29.730 --> 55:32.665
I'm... fluid.

55:32.667 --> 55:36.936
I'm everything, okay?
I'm LGBTQIA blender.

55:36.938 --> 55:38.537
What is "IA"?

55:38.539 --> 55:41.540
Intersex and asexual, I think.

55:41.542 --> 55:44.712
You "think"? If you know that,
you are it.

55:53.054 --> 55:54.922
She asked
not to be disturbed.

55:56.057 --> 55:57.692
Just five minutes.

55:58.759 --> 56:00.493
I'm next, anyway, so...

56:04.999 --> 56:06.466
Is this your first time
seeing Ronnie?

56:08.468 --> 56:10.470
I've seen her every day
for the past five years.

56:13.608 --> 56:15.174
You must be really fucked up.

56:17.511 --> 56:19.814
I am extraordinarily
fucked up.

56:21.682 --> 56:22.750
You can't be that fucked up.

56:23.851 --> 56:25.720
I've never seen you before.

56:27.622 --> 56:31.190
I see her off-site.
Like, way off-site.

56:31.192 --> 56:33.995
I'm either in a straitjacket
or in an institution.

56:37.098 --> 56:39.464
She's a mental patient herself,
you know.

56:39.466 --> 56:41.702
She's, um, not even
a real shrink, no license.

56:43.170 --> 56:44.572
That's funny.

56:48.475 --> 56:51.210
You're not, um...
You're not buying it?

56:51.212 --> 56:53.646
- No.
- What gave me away?

56:53.648 --> 56:54.982
Hmm, all of it.

57:00.154 --> 57:01.454
She's, um...

57:02.556 --> 57:03.856
I do see her every day though.

57:03.858 --> 57:05.760
She's my evil stepmother.

57:10.698 --> 57:11.799
Can I see your drawings?

57:13.200 --> 57:16.168
Okay.

57:16.170 --> 57:18.871
Hey, what are you doing here?

57:18.873 --> 57:21.707
I'm locked out,
Dad's not picking up his phone.

57:21.709 --> 57:24.109
Okay, um, I'll give you my key.

57:24.111 --> 57:25.179
Come on in, Ian.

57:33.154 --> 57:34.922
Thank you
so much for waiting.

57:49.837 --> 57:51.070
Do you two know each other?

57:51.072 --> 57:53.305
Uh, no. He's famous, though.

57:53.307 --> 57:55.774
He used to deal drugs
outside the Art Institute.

57:55.776 --> 57:58.744
He wasn't dealing.
They just found something in his home.

57:58.746 --> 58:00.214
Yeah. A ton of "something."

58:02.283 --> 58:04.249
Okay.

58:04.251 --> 58:05.818
Let me tell you a secret?

58:05.820 --> 58:09.021
Um, I'd rather that you didn't.

58:09.023 --> 58:10.322
Please, I need
to tell someone.

58:10.324 --> 58:11.892
Oh, what, are you knocked up
or something?

58:12.827 --> 58:15.160
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

58:15.162 --> 58:17.129
Yes, but, please,
don't tell your dad.

58:17.131 --> 58:19.133
I wanna tell him first, okay?
I gotta go.

58:29.877 --> 58:32.111
Come on, Dad. Pick up.

58:59.607 --> 59:00.806
Fuck off.

59:00.808 --> 59:04.043
Hey, my party, my house,
my rules.

59:04.045 --> 59:05.813
- You're being a dick, bro.
- What?

59:21.629 --> 59:23.197
You're a disappointment.

59:24.832 --> 59:26.298
Why am I
a disappointment to you?

59:26.300 --> 59:29.003
You're disappointing
because you're here.

59:31.939 --> 59:33.939
How do you know Tim
and his stupid parties?

59:33.941 --> 59:35.910
I don't know Tim,
or his stupid parties.

59:36.944 --> 59:38.277
Good.

59:38.279 --> 59:40.181
So you're here to see me?

59:40.881 --> 59:42.716
Nah, I came here with a friend.

59:44.218 --> 59:47.088
He said he'd be back in a minute
like, three hours ago.

59:47.388 --> 59:48.722
So...

59:54.428 --> 59:56.130
Do you get along at all
with your parents?

1:00:02.303 --> 1:00:04.638
I don't really like
talking about my family.

1:00:05.206 --> 1:00:06.207
Why not?

1:00:07.975 --> 1:00:10.209
Well...

1:00:10.211 --> 1:00:14.680
Then we got to talk about dead
mothers, and absent fathers,

1:00:14.682 --> 1:00:19.186
and needles and...
Just shit.

1:00:23.757 --> 1:00:25.390
So then,
what do you want to talk about?

1:00:25.392 --> 1:00:28.329
Something more cheerful?

1:00:28.996 --> 1:00:30.364
Yeah.

1:00:31.265 --> 1:00:32.764
You know a lot about war?

1:00:32.766 --> 1:00:37.838
Disease, sex, famine.

1:00:38.973 --> 1:00:40.372
That kind of stuff?

1:00:40.374 --> 1:00:44.211
Well, I lost
my mom when I was a kid.

1:00:47.248 --> 1:00:49.081
Dead mothers.
They're always there.

1:00:49.083 --> 1:00:51.984
My mom's not dead.
She's just lost.

1:00:51.986 --> 1:00:53.988
Like, literally, lost.

1:00:55.289 --> 1:00:58.926
She left with this hippie freak
named Jim Purdy.

1:01:01.228 --> 1:01:02.363
"Purdy."

1:01:05.466 --> 1:01:06.967
He didn't like kids.

1:01:08.802 --> 1:01:11.436
So, now my mom lives in Oregon.

1:01:11.438 --> 1:01:14.308
And my dad never forgave her
for not fighting for custody.

1:01:21.315 --> 1:01:24.283
Well, it's a good thing
your dad found Ronnie.

1:01:24.285 --> 1:01:27.386
You know what?
Maybe you're right.

1:01:27.388 --> 1:01:29.421
Maybe we shouldn't
talk about family.

1:01:29.423 --> 1:01:30.758
You don't like Ronnie?

1:01:31.660 --> 1:01:34.161
I don't like anyone
over the age of 25.

1:01:39.066 --> 1:01:43.235
Ronnie forced my dad to make
me go see this therapist...

1:01:43.237 --> 1:01:45.370
who made me see
this psychiatrist,

1:01:45.372 --> 1:01:48.242
put me on these meds that I was
on for like two years, and...

1:01:50.444 --> 1:01:52.311
I actually threatened
to drop out of high school

1:01:52.313 --> 1:01:55.047
if he didn't let me stop seeing
those mental fuckers.

1:01:55.049 --> 1:01:57.482
Sounds more like daddy issues
than Ronnie issues to me.

1:01:57.484 --> 1:01:58.886
Fuck off.

1:02:01.889 --> 1:02:04.056
Is she a good therapist?

1:02:04.058 --> 1:02:05.826
I wouldn't know.
She's my first.

1:02:07.027 --> 1:02:08.293
And I have to see her.

1:02:08.295 --> 1:02:11.732
I mean, it's court order
after I was busted.

1:02:15.302 --> 1:02:17.436
I don't always listen to her.

1:02:17.438 --> 1:02:19.539
I have a way
of tuning her out.

1:02:19.541 --> 1:02:21.273
Usually I just think about
fucking her.

1:02:21.275 --> 1:02:22.409
Jesus.

1:02:27.114 --> 1:02:28.816
Is that too much information?

1:02:30.451 --> 1:02:32.119
What the fuck?

1:02:35.356 --> 1:02:37.055
Did, um...

1:02:37.057 --> 1:02:38.292
Did you serve time?

1:02:40.027 --> 1:02:41.529
I served time.

1:02:45.132 --> 1:02:47.833
Do you wanna see
my faded jail ass tattoos?

1:02:47.835 --> 1:02:49.136
Do you have any?

1:02:52.006 --> 1:02:54.106
I was in jail one night.

1:02:54.108 --> 1:02:57.211
I read a book.
It was a fun fucking night.

1:03:01.915 --> 1:03:03.284
Don't look so heartbroken.

1:03:04.918 --> 1:03:07.886
I'm desperate to get a tattoo
of the third eye.

1:03:07.888 --> 1:03:08.954
On your forehead?

1:03:08.956 --> 1:03:10.157
No. On my ankle.

1:03:12.393 --> 1:03:14.459
Oh, I get it.

1:03:14.461 --> 1:03:16.564
So you can see where
you're going at ground level.

1:03:17.865 --> 1:03:19.364
It's...

1:03:19.366 --> 1:03:21.435
No, it's actually cool.

1:03:32.614 --> 1:03:34.148
What'd you do that for?

1:03:37.652 --> 1:03:39.320
My reputation.

1:03:43.023 --> 1:03:45.893
Look, you should know,
I'm never gonna love you or anything.

1:03:47.361 --> 1:03:48.829
Like, I'm never gonna...

1:03:49.698 --> 1:03:53.065
say things like,
"I love you," or...

1:03:53.067 --> 1:03:54.900
any of that bourgeois bullshit.

1:03:54.902 --> 1:03:56.036
I'm just...

1:03:58.205 --> 1:03:59.873
I will never love you
or anyone.

1:04:04.912 --> 1:04:05.979
Cool.

1:04:41.081 --> 1:04:44.116
- Ian.
- Hey.

1:04:44.118 --> 1:04:45.285
One second.

1:04:52.426 --> 1:04:54.627
Hey.

1:04:54.629 --> 1:04:57.097
- I still got an hour left.
- I'll wait.

1:05:22.389 --> 1:05:24.592
I'll be right back.

1:05:51.251 --> 1:05:53.519
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:05:53.521 --> 1:05:55.989
I'm Shannon, Ian's, um...

1:05:57.525 --> 1:05:59.326
Oh, uh...

1:06:01.361 --> 1:06:02.963
Ian's not back yet.

1:06:05.032 --> 1:06:07.034
I'm David, Ian's uncle.

1:06:11.472 --> 1:06:14.540
Yeah, I've been looking into
all kinds of beers lately,

1:06:14.542 --> 1:06:16.308
you know,
to better educate myself.

1:06:16.310 --> 1:06:18.278
Blows my mind how many
different kinds there are.

1:06:19.413 --> 1:06:21.348
Why do you need a better
beer education?

1:06:23.083 --> 1:06:24.351
Ian didn't tell you?

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:26.987
Tell me what?

1:06:29.189 --> 1:06:31.757
I got this old friend, Tib,

1:06:31.759 --> 1:06:34.560
and he's telling about me about
this pub in North Carolina,

1:06:34.562 --> 1:06:37.395
The Cove,
and Tib wants to buy it.

1:06:37.397 --> 1:06:41.333
Except Tib's got less than an illustrious
past, if you know what I'm meaning.

1:06:41.335 --> 1:06:42.704
He can't get a loan.

1:06:43.505 --> 1:06:44.770
So I go down to see it

1:06:44.772 --> 1:06:45.773
and I gotta tell you...

1:06:47.241 --> 1:06:48.340
I fell in love with the place.

1:06:48.342 --> 1:06:50.375
You know, the people,
the town...

1:06:50.377 --> 1:06:51.777
I got a little money
stashed away

1:06:51.779 --> 1:06:54.481
and Ian's got some from
his mother's life insurance.

1:06:56.283 --> 1:06:59.284
So, as soon as he clears 18 and
we're done with the paperwork,

1:06:59.286 --> 1:07:00.622
you know, probation and such,

1:07:01.623 --> 1:07:02.757
we're going down there.

1:07:04.559 --> 1:07:05.658
It's right on the beach too.

1:07:05.660 --> 1:07:07.027
That's why they call it
"The Cove."

1:07:09.196 --> 1:07:10.397
You should come visit us.

1:07:11.198 --> 1:07:12.366
Thanks.

1:07:14.502 --> 1:07:17.639
Oh, you guys don't talk much
when you're together, huh?

1:07:20.742 --> 1:07:22.276
We talk a lot.

1:07:23.110 --> 1:07:24.311
Oh, about what?

1:07:26.614 --> 1:07:28.482
Everything.

1:07:32.185 --> 1:07:34.119
He's not what he seems,
you know.

1:07:34.121 --> 1:07:35.322
What, a drug dealer?

1:07:37.157 --> 1:07:39.124
He made a mistake.

1:07:39.126 --> 1:07:40.494
A 16-ounce mistake.

1:07:42.296 --> 1:07:45.565
Thing I don't understand
is how he got all that hash

1:07:45.567 --> 1:07:47.134
into his house by himself.

1:07:51.305 --> 1:07:52.774
He gets around.

1:07:59.346 --> 1:08:01.446
It's lucky there are
no mandatory sentencing laws

1:08:01.448 --> 1:08:03.551
for underage offenders
in the state.

1:08:05.887 --> 1:08:08.388
Well, I gotta head out.

1:08:35.883 --> 1:08:37.449
What are you doing?

1:08:37.451 --> 1:08:39.384
They're beautiful.

1:08:39.386 --> 1:08:41.121
Stop. Those are private.

1:08:43.658 --> 1:08:45.323
They're also really fucked up.

1:08:45.325 --> 1:08:48.395
Yeah, they're just
violent fantasies, they're...

1:08:49.731 --> 1:08:51.198
Not real.

1:09:01.375 --> 1:09:02.610
Your uncle's a creep.

1:09:09.684 --> 1:09:11.318
Did you finally run away
from home?

1:09:11.953 --> 1:09:13.755
I can't harbor a fugitive.

1:09:16.356 --> 1:09:20.662
No, I just... I wanted to see
you before the stupid gala.

1:09:26.567 --> 1:09:29.604
- What?
- Why didn't you tell me about The Cove?

1:09:31.706 --> 1:09:33.306
Um...

1:09:34.008 --> 1:09:35.342
I thought I did.

1:09:37.578 --> 1:09:39.477
Sorry.

1:09:39.479 --> 1:09:40.846
You're gonna leave me
for a bar?

1:09:40.848 --> 1:09:42.480
Wait. Relax for a second.

1:09:42.482 --> 1:09:44.282
I don't even know
if The Cove is gonna happen.

1:09:44.284 --> 1:09:47.520
Um, David's been talking about
The Cove for, like, a year.

1:09:47.522 --> 1:09:48.556
So...

1:09:49.724 --> 1:09:50.958
It's got nothing to do with us.

1:09:54.028 --> 1:09:55.630
If you betray me,
I'll kill you.

1:09:57.397 --> 1:09:58.700
Are you proposing to me?

1:10:00.968 --> 1:10:03.838
And if you leave me,
I'll have to kill myself.

1:10:04.772 --> 1:10:07.540
Let's not say that, all right?

1:10:07.542 --> 1:10:08.910
You're the one going to college.

1:10:10.778 --> 1:10:12.345
You're right.

1:10:13.881 --> 1:10:15.550
Maybe I'll have to just
kill us both.

1:10:19.954 --> 1:10:23.490
You're so,
so beautifully strange.

1:10:27.294 --> 1:10:28.763
I have to change.

1:10:29.597 --> 1:10:31.329
No, don't change.

1:10:31.331 --> 1:10:32.998
Don't change,
I like the way you are.

1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:34.535
For the gala.

1:10:41.475 --> 1:10:44.309
So you came to my house
to use it as a dressing room?

1:10:44.311 --> 1:10:46.848
Yeah. Is that not okay?

1:10:49.917 --> 1:10:51.519
No, it's okay.

1:10:56.958 --> 1:11:00.762
Hey, um, I don't think
you should go to the gala.

1:11:04.565 --> 1:11:06.466
I could come back later.

1:11:11.672 --> 1:11:13.875
I don't think you should go
to North Carolina.

1:11:16.043 --> 1:11:17.344
Okay.

1:11:18.679 --> 1:11:20.280
Okay.

1:11:27.088 --> 1:11:29.722
I might have to go
to the gala at some point.

1:11:29.724 --> 1:11:31.624
I may have to go
to North Carolina at some point.

1:11:39.867 --> 1:11:41.068
Honestly...

1:11:44.772 --> 1:11:46.406
You're the prettiest star.

1:11:50.144 --> 1:11:51.612
I love you.

1:11:53.114 --> 1:11:54.949
I don't love you.

1:11:58.653 --> 1:11:59.720
Say it again.

1:12:01.454 --> 1:12:02.657
I don't love you.

1:12:02.957 --> 1:12:04.058
Again.

1:12:06.027 --> 1:12:07.425
No. You're a masochist.

1:12:07.427 --> 1:12:10.463
I'm not going to give you
that satisfaction.

1:12:16.403 --> 1:12:18.070
I...

1:12:18.072 --> 1:12:20.975
I don't love you.

1:12:28.716 --> 1:12:30.149
Hi.

1:12:30.151 --> 1:12:31.283
What did I miss?

1:12:31.285 --> 1:12:35.022
- Death by classical music.
- How's your new boyfriend?

1:12:36.724 --> 1:12:38.358
Creamy.

1:12:40.862 --> 1:12:44.630
Clearly, I'm not the only one
who deserves this.

1:12:44.632 --> 1:12:45.900
But I'll take it.

1:12:47.969 --> 1:12:51.136
What is that? Is that a Borolo?
Is that a Borolo?

1:12:51.138 --> 1:12:52.874
- Um, sorry.
- I'm asking...

1:12:54.108 --> 1:12:57.209
Hey, don't be an asshole.

1:12:57.211 --> 1:12:59.714
Give me the bottle.
Give me the bottle.

1:13:01.849 --> 1:13:03.716
He's the asshole, okay?

1:13:03.718 --> 1:13:05.184
What's that?

1:13:05.186 --> 1:13:07.154
Nothing.

1:13:16.931 --> 1:13:19.531
- Answer it.
- I'm turning it off.

1:13:19.533 --> 1:13:21.002
Okay, no...

1:13:23.604 --> 1:13:25.740
Shannon's phone,
how may I direct your call?

1:13:30.011 --> 1:13:32.077
All right.

1:13:32.079 --> 1:13:34.515
- All right, is he passed out?
- Give that to me.

1:13:35.082 --> 1:13:36.181
Give it to me.

1:13:36.183 --> 1:13:41.486
Jamie? Tim, what's going on?

1:13:41.488 --> 1:13:44.723
Uh, do you know where
Jamie is? Okay.

1:13:44.725 --> 1:13:47.993
- Oh, hey, asshole.
- Oh, yeah, thanks, you're a great friend.

1:13:47.995 --> 1:13:49.995
Fuck you, he's not my problem.

1:13:49.997 --> 1:13:51.563
I don't even know why
he showed up.

1:13:51.565 --> 1:13:53.933
He puked his guts out
all over my mom's purse and rug.

1:13:53.935 --> 1:13:55.569
I had it with that fag.

1:14:01.108 --> 1:14:03.577
Jamie. Can you hear me?

1:14:04.912 --> 1:14:07.112
- Hi.
- I wanna go home.

1:14:07.114 --> 1:14:08.914
Yeah, I'm gonna take you home.

1:14:08.916 --> 1:14:11.617
I don't need you, I can drive.

1:14:11.619 --> 1:14:12.720
Which one do you wanna drive?

1:14:13.521 --> 1:14:14.755
What do you mean?

1:14:16.958 --> 1:14:20.225
It's your mission. We gotta get
both cars back to the house.

1:14:20.227 --> 1:14:22.063
Why? You can just
get his car tomorrow.

1:14:22.730 --> 1:14:24.229
You don't know his parents.

1:14:24.231 --> 1:14:26.865
If they find out he was too drunk to
drive, they'll do something mean.

1:14:26.867 --> 1:14:28.903
Like what? Write him
out of the will?

1:14:34.041 --> 1:14:36.308
Calling to tell me how
much you like the Wrangler?

1:14:36.310 --> 1:14:40.045
<i>Um, you're driving
really slow.</i>

1:14:40.047 --> 1:14:41.981
You know what?
It's actually really dark

1:14:41.983 --> 1:14:44.085
and I'm a little nervous,
I don't think we should be on the phone.

1:14:49.824 --> 1:14:53.258
Slow down, macho man.
Shit. Ian.

1:14:53.260 --> 1:14:54.960
Fuck, are you still there?

1:14:54.962 --> 1:14:57.296
- Ian. Fuck. Why are you doing this to me?
- Shit.

1:14:57.298 --> 1:14:59.331
- Hi.
- What is going on?

1:14:59.333 --> 1:15:03.836
Uh, you passed out at Tim's,
and then you called me.

1:15:03.838 --> 1:15:07.840
Shit. Shit, I smell like puke.

1:15:07.842 --> 1:15:09.877
Yes, you do smell like puke.

1:15:10.611 --> 1:15:13.846
I'm glad I lost
my stupid award.

1:15:13.848 --> 1:15:17.016
I know they all hate me at school.
I never even wanted to go there.

1:15:17.018 --> 1:15:20.019
They don't hate you at school.
We've been there for 12 years.

1:15:20.021 --> 1:15:21.920
Would you please
sit in your seat?

1:15:21.922 --> 1:15:25.157
I think my dad's fucking
his secretary.

1:15:25.159 --> 1:15:26.825
Mmm-hmm.

1:15:26.827 --> 1:15:28.961
- All right, don't look so sad.
- Fuck you.

1:15:28.963 --> 1:15:32.533
- You just need a little rest.
- Fuck you, I'm not even drunk.

1:16:02.229 --> 1:16:03.564
Ah.

1:16:05.399 --> 1:16:06.767
You okay?

1:16:07.368 --> 1:16:08.602
Yeah.

1:16:15.076 --> 1:16:17.309
Jesus, look.
Something happened.

1:16:17.311 --> 1:16:19.745
- Keep driving.
- I can't even see anything.

1:16:19.747 --> 1:16:22.081
Shannon, keep driving.

1:16:22.083 --> 1:16:24.950
- No, hold on...
- Just keep driving the fucking car.

1:16:24.952 --> 1:16:27.019
He got
knocked off the road.

1:16:27.021 --> 1:16:31.824
It was an accident,
it was a man on a bicycle.

1:16:31.826 --> 1:16:33.027
Yeah, he's hurt pretty bad.

1:16:35.296 --> 1:16:38.230
I hit some kind of animal, okay?

1:16:38.232 --> 1:16:40.768
It happened so fast,
I didn't even...

1:16:42.903 --> 1:16:44.672
I barely even touched it.

1:16:45.172 --> 1:16:46.672
Why didn't you stop?

1:16:46.674 --> 1:16:50.709
I don't know. I don't know!
You were with fucking Jamie, I don't know.

1:16:50.711 --> 1:16:54.446
Fuck. Fucking, goddamn it.
Fuck!

1:16:54.448 --> 1:16:57.318
Please... Please, stop what you're doing. Please.

1:16:58.285 --> 1:17:01.255
- We have to go back.
- No, we can't go back.

1:17:02.289 --> 1:17:04.389
You know my situation,
all right?

1:17:04.391 --> 1:17:07.793
I didn't even touch him
with the car, I barely hit him.

1:17:07.795 --> 1:17:11.130
Please, I will fucking kill myself
before I go to prison, okay?

1:17:11.132 --> 1:17:13.198
I will fucking kill myself.

1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:14.368
Do you understand?

1:17:31.018 --> 1:17:34.221
Shannon...

1:17:37.324 --> 1:17:39.026
- Knock.
- Sorry.

1:17:39.493 --> 1:17:40.728
What do you want?

1:17:43.230 --> 1:17:44.331
What's going on?

1:17:48.035 --> 1:17:51.005
Where were you? Huh?

1:17:52.139 --> 1:17:53.440
Why didn't you call me?

1:17:55.142 --> 1:17:56.777
- I'm late.
- For what?

1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:01.081
Hey.

1:18:20.434 --> 1:18:23.101
- Hey, you alone?
- <i>Hold on. Okay, what's up?</i>

1:18:23.103 --> 1:18:24.870
What do you remember
from last night?

1:18:24.872 --> 1:18:26.772
<i>You drove me home, right?</i>

1:18:26.774 --> 1:18:29.374
Yeah, I left the keys
on the dashboard at the party.

1:18:29.376 --> 1:18:31.376
Tim drove it back
so you won't get in trouble.

1:18:31.378 --> 1:18:33.011
I don't know... I...

1:18:33.013 --> 1:18:35.480
- I drove you home in my dad's car.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

1:18:35.482 --> 1:18:37.983
<i>Sorry to be such a royal pain.</i>

1:18:37.985 --> 1:18:40.285
<i>Oh, listen, my mom's
having an affair.</i>

1:18:40.287 --> 1:18:42.187
Jesus, Jamie.

1:18:42.189 --> 1:18:43.991
<i>Shit. I'll call you back.</i>

1:18:48.329 --> 1:18:50.395
Jamie was drunk,
he doesn't remember anything.

1:18:50.397 --> 1:18:53.332
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- It's not fine.

1:18:53.334 --> 1:18:55.000
It's the furthest thing
from fine.

1:18:55.002 --> 1:18:57.570
There were no witnesses
and nobody saw.

1:18:57.572 --> 1:19:01.006
- I'm not gonna tell...
- They're gonna lock me up and throw away the key.

1:19:01.008 --> 1:19:02.040
Come here, you're not listening.

1:19:02.042 --> 1:19:05.110
We're gonna go to North Carolina.

1:19:05.112 --> 1:19:07.112
You're gonna turn 18,
we're gonna work at The Cove,

1:19:07.114 --> 1:19:08.280
we're gonna put this
all behind us.

1:19:08.282 --> 1:19:09.515
- You gotta get off me.
- No. Come on.

1:19:09.517 --> 1:19:13.385
Get off me, get off!
Goddamn it, shut up!

1:19:13.387 --> 1:19:16.922
Get off me! Goddamn it!
Get off!

1:19:21.596 --> 1:19:23.931
I don't wanna die.

1:19:28.035 --> 1:19:29.236
Okay...

1:19:39.413 --> 1:19:40.312
What's this about?

1:19:40.314 --> 1:19:42.216
It's a police matter.

1:19:47.988 --> 1:19:49.988
<i>Trust me, I totally
understand you</i>

1:19:49.990 --> 1:19:51.356
covering up for your boyfriend.

1:19:51.358 --> 1:19:53.025
He's not my boyfriend.

1:19:53.027 --> 1:19:56.094
Huh. But he was your boyfriend?

1:19:56.096 --> 1:19:58.430
- Does it matter?
- Everyone saw you with him at the party,

1:19:58.432 --> 1:19:59.833
arguing about his car keys.

1:20:01.536 --> 1:20:03.935
The question is, who's going
to get in trouble for it,

1:20:03.937 --> 1:20:05.170
not you or him.

1:20:05.172 --> 1:20:07.306
We're talking about
a hit and run.

1:20:07.308 --> 1:20:09.241
Brain damage at the very least.

1:20:09.243 --> 1:20:12.010
Clearly Jamie was driving
the Wrangler.

1:20:12.012 --> 1:20:14.114
Drunk. Upset.

1:20:15.015 --> 1:20:16.016
Maybe at you?

1:20:34.001 --> 1:20:37.603
<i>Multimillionaire Quint
Manning's oldest son, a high school senior</i>

1:20:37.605 --> 1:20:39.572
<i>who was last seen before
the accident</i>

1:20:39.574 --> 1:20:42.174
<i>leaving a house party
highly intoxicated</i>

1:20:42.176 --> 1:20:45.344
<i>with a friend, fellow student
from the Buckford School,</i>

1:20:45.346 --> 1:20:46.878
<i>a co-ed private school.</i>

1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:49.515
<i>The young father hit
by a car just over two weeks ago</i>

1:20:49.517 --> 1:20:53.085
<i>while cycling home from his
place of work has now died.</i>

1:20:53.087 --> 1:20:56.188
<i>Police continue to investigate the crime...</i>

1:21:15.409 --> 1:21:16.609
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

1:21:16.611 --> 1:21:19.712
- I'm, uh...
- You have to stay away from him, Shannon.

1:21:19.714 --> 1:21:21.446
Why, you're his bodyguard now?

1:21:21.448 --> 1:21:24.383
I make decisions for him,
not you, not the courts, I do.

1:21:24.385 --> 1:21:26.485
Ever since he was 13
and Ginny died.

1:21:26.487 --> 1:21:29.287
Yeah, and you've been doing
a great job, Uncle David.

1:21:29.289 --> 1:21:32.525
All right, listen, why don't you go
home, I'll let him know you came by.

1:21:32.527 --> 1:21:35.360
- No, you won't.
- Nobody can find out you know each other.

1:21:35.362 --> 1:21:37.164
If he gets arrested again,
he's not gonna make it.

1:21:38.700 --> 1:21:39.900
Shannon, wait.

1:21:41.636 --> 1:21:45.070
Think about it.
Do you want him to hurt himself again?

1:21:45.072 --> 1:21:48.608
I raised him like a son.
He's not going to jail

1:21:48.610 --> 1:21:51.078
because some spoiled,
rich kid got drunk.

1:21:51.912 --> 1:21:55.683
Go home. Go home
to mommy and daddy.

1:21:57.418 --> 1:21:59.587
Don't try to call him,
he's got a new number.

1:23:01.181 --> 1:23:02.316
Ronnie?

1:23:53.100 --> 1:23:54.232
<i>Drew wants
to make a deal</i>

1:23:54.234 --> 1:23:55.701
<i>that he says
could clear Jamie.</i>

1:23:55.703 --> 1:23:58.236
<i>He says he has information that
could get him out of this mess.</i>

1:23:58.238 --> 1:24:00.305
- Take the deal.
- Well, we don't know what the deal is.

1:24:00.307 --> 1:24:01.375
What did he say?

1:24:02.877 --> 1:24:05.310
I hung up.

1:24:05.312 --> 1:24:09.049
- What?
- Yes, he's a liar and a fraud, Carr.

1:24:10.818 --> 1:24:12.585
- Hey.
- And what are you?

1:24:12.587 --> 1:24:16.256
Hey. I can't get involved
in some kind of conspiracy.

1:24:16.891 --> 1:24:18.558
All right?

1:24:32.139 --> 1:24:33.440
Where's Quint?

1:24:34.207 --> 1:24:35.242
It's just us.

1:24:37.512 --> 1:24:39.146
What do you have, Drew?

1:24:41.683 --> 1:24:43.317
My daughter has been lying.

1:24:45.218 --> 1:24:47.152
There's no other way to say it.

1:24:47.154 --> 1:24:49.622
I thought she was doing it
to protect Jamie.

1:24:49.624 --> 1:24:51.458
But I found out
your son is innocent.

1:24:53.528 --> 1:24:55.228
Did you go to the police?

1:25:02.402 --> 1:25:03.403
What do you want?

1:25:03.938 --> 1:25:06.639
I want my money back.

1:25:06.641 --> 1:25:10.843
I want my investment in WMV,
plus the 18% that Quint promised me.

1:25:10.845 --> 1:25:13.411
- I'm not involved...
- Please don't play with me.

1:25:13.413 --> 1:25:15.548
He thinks that I'm a small man,
an ignorant man,

1:25:15.550 --> 1:25:16.549
that what I have in the world

1:25:16.551 --> 1:25:18.884
doesn't add up to him
even paying attention.

1:25:18.886 --> 1:25:22.253
Well...

1:25:22.255 --> 1:25:24.857
I can provide you the information
that will save your son.

1:25:24.859 --> 1:25:28.393
That's worth something,
and all I'm asking is that

1:25:28.395 --> 1:25:30.665
you give me what
I already have coming to me.

1:25:32.466 --> 1:25:35.601
The police will get the name.
I don't need your information.

1:25:35.603 --> 1:25:37.503
Really?

1:25:37.505 --> 1:25:40.472
Your son is about
to be indicted, Mrs. Manning.

1:25:40.474 --> 1:25:42.508
Don't you read the papers?

1:25:42.510 --> 1:25:44.242
The more your lawyers deny it,

1:25:44.244 --> 1:25:46.211
the more the press
and the public are sure

1:25:46.213 --> 1:25:47.214
it was Jamie.

1:25:48.248 --> 1:25:49.884
Jury's not gonna be kind to him.

1:25:51.485 --> 1:25:53.719
But I'll give you the name.
I promise.

1:25:53.721 --> 1:25:55.389
I will make this nightmare
go away.

1:25:56.456 --> 1:25:59.659
Your husband
took everything I had.

1:25:59.661 --> 1:26:02.597
Tell him to pay me,
and I will go to the police...

1:26:03.665 --> 1:26:05.965
and your lives start over.

1:26:05.967 --> 1:26:07.869
Maybe you have to pay
the victim's family.

1:26:08.870 --> 1:26:11.704
It was your car, after all.

1:26:11.706 --> 1:26:14.940
I'm not a lawyer, but insurance
would probably value

1:26:14.942 --> 1:26:17.409
Jarvis on the low end.

1:26:17.411 --> 1:26:19.912
Probably as much as your
husband makes in a week.

1:26:19.914 --> 1:26:22.014
Much less than
you paid for this place.

1:26:22.016 --> 1:26:24.384
The money will be
in your account in an hour.

1:26:27.021 --> 1:26:29.689
- The investment.
- No. No, please...

1:26:29.691 --> 1:26:31.991
- Um, Quint...
- The initial investment.

1:26:31.993 --> 1:26:33.425
- I...
- Nothing more.

1:26:33.427 --> 1:26:36.229
I have interest on a loan.
That investment...

1:26:49.944 --> 1:26:51.979
Shannon, please,
you need to eat.

1:26:59.787 --> 1:27:01.889
You know what?
I've had about enough of this.

1:27:03.490 --> 1:27:04.890
I know people
at the department.

1:27:04.892 --> 1:27:07.626
If you say you drove Jamie,
then you drove Jamie and that's that.

1:27:11.799 --> 1:27:13.000
It was Ian.

1:27:15.368 --> 1:27:16.637
It was Ian Warfield.

1:27:18.740 --> 1:27:21.609
- Ian Warfield?
- He drove the Wrangler.

1:27:22.643 --> 1:27:23.845
He hit the biker.

1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:27.280
Oh, God.

1:27:29.550 --> 1:27:30.918
I'm in love with him.

1:27:33.688 --> 1:27:36.021
You can't tell anybody.

1:27:36.023 --> 1:27:37.558
You're his shrink. You can't.

1:27:47.769 --> 1:27:50.970
<i>We're sorry, you have
reached a number that is disconnected</i>

1:27:50.972 --> 1:27:52.437
- <i>or is no longer in...</i>
- We should go there.

1:27:52.439 --> 1:27:55.975
- Shannon.
- No, we should. I have a feeling something terrible has happened.

1:27:55.977 --> 1:27:56.976
Yes, but you don't know that.

1:27:56.978 --> 1:27:58.744
Haven't you ever been
connected to somebody

1:27:58.746 --> 1:28:01.113
and you just know things
about them?

1:28:01.115 --> 1:28:05.951
- Oh, my God.
- Shannon... Shannon, stay in the car.

1:28:05.953 --> 1:28:07.354
You need to stay here.

1:28:15.362 --> 1:28:16.796
Excuse me.

1:28:16.798 --> 1:28:20.300
I'm his doctor, Officer.

1:28:22.837 --> 1:28:24.872
Excuse me,
ma'am, please understand.

1:28:26.574 --> 1:28:28.473
- Shannon, Shannon.
- No, I'm sorry, I live here.

1:28:28.475 --> 1:28:30.845
- Shannon.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1:28:35.850 --> 1:28:37.683
No.

1:28:37.685 --> 1:28:42.588
No!

1:28:42.590 --> 1:28:44.924
Pulse is 58,
respiration is unsteady.

1:28:44.926 --> 1:28:49.329
BP is 90 over 50, we're going to need a
couple of hemo units when they get here.

1:28:57.872 --> 1:28:59.674
Happy baby.

1:29:04.645 --> 1:29:07.947
You wanna go? You wanna go?

1:29:07.949 --> 1:29:09.181
Okay, okay...

1:29:09.183 --> 1:29:11.919
Oh.

1:29:12.520 --> 1:29:13.921
Giddy up.

1:29:14.822 --> 1:29:17.990
Yeah, baby. You ready?

1:29:17.992 --> 1:29:21.727
Look at the birds.
Look at all the birds.

1:29:23.164 --> 1:29:25.700
Look at those birds.

1:29:30.638 --> 1:29:33.941
You want that one?
Here, take that one.

1:29:34.876 --> 1:29:36.077
Mom.

1:29:40.214 --> 1:29:42.181
- This is Jason.
- Hi.

1:29:42.183 --> 1:29:43.816
So nice to meet you.

1:29:43.818 --> 1:29:45.985
Of course.

1:29:45.987 --> 1:29:47.753
- Wanna go?
- Yeah, sure.

1:29:47.755 --> 1:29:49.422
- We good?
- It's nice to meet you.
