[laughter and shouting]

00:12.180 --> 00:14.448
[whistle blows]

00:16.550 --> 00:18.152
HIKE!

00:34.802 --> 00:38.406
[school bell rings]

00:46.280 --> 00:47.615
(boy)
HEY.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.485
HEY.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.455
SO, UH, WHAT
DID YOU WANT?

00:56.324 --> 00:58.126
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.193
TOO LATE
FOR WHAT?

00:59.227 --> 01:00.194
I'LL TELL
YOU LATER.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.130
COME ON,
THE BELL JUST RANG.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.197
WE STILL GOT TIME.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.169
I'M READY.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.871
UH, YOU SURE?

01:10.904 --> 01:14.642
YEAH.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.777
WHY NOW,
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

01:16.810 --> 01:18.346
WHAT, YOU DON'T WANT TO
ANYMORE?

01:18.379 --> 01:19.780
YEAH, I DO.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.250
I'M JUST WONDERING
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.318
YOU DID.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.792
NOW?

01:31.825 --> 01:33.327
IF YOU WANT.

01:38.499 --> 01:41.169
(woman)
EXCUSE ME.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.870
YOU TWO NEED
TO COME WITH ME.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.279
TAKE A SEAT.
BUT WE DIDN'T--

01:51.312 --> 01:53.547
(Ms. Washburn)
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE BACK THERE.

01:53.581 --> 01:54.815
(boy)
WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.917
THAT'S NOT WHAT
IT LOOKED LIKE TO ME.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.586
PRINCIPAL FIELDS
WILL BE BACK

01:58.619 --> 02:00.421
AS SOON
AS THE ASSEMBLY IS OVER.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.556
MS. WASHBURN, PLEASE, IF I GET
ONE MORE REFERRAL, MY MOM--

02:02.590 --> 02:03.824
[paper tearing]

02:03.857 --> 02:06.260
BENCH.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.904
WHO PUT SAND
IN HER VAGINA?

02:23.244 --> 02:26.214
[Massive Attack's
Teardrop]

02:26.247 --> 02:34.255
*

03:04.352 --> 03:06.520
HEY, KIDS.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.956
HOW YOU BOYS DOING?

03:08.989 --> 03:11.659
UH, CAN WE HELP YOU?

03:11.692 --> 03:14.462
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.430
YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS?

03:16.464 --> 03:18.499
A LAPTOP?

03:18.532 --> 03:21.869
PASSWORD-PROTECTED LAPTOP

03:21.902 --> 03:23.904
THAT I NEED YOU
NERDS TO HACK INTO.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.939
NO INSECTICIDES
OR TOXIC CLEANERS.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.608
CHECK THE BATHROOM.

03:27.641 --> 03:28.609
WHO ARE YOU?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.244
YOUR ROOMMATE'S DOCTOR.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.945
YOU REMEMBER
YOUR ROOMMATE, DON'T YOU?

03:31.979 --> 03:35.283
I THOUGHT HE
JUST HAD BRONCHITIS.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.550
THAT'S WHAT THE MORONS

03:36.584 --> 03:38.519
AT THE RUTGERS STUDENT
MEDICAL CENTER THOUGHT,

03:38.552 --> 03:41.355
WHICH MAY BE PART OF THE REASON
HE JUST COUGHED UP A LUNG.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.991
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HE COUGHED UP A LUNG?

03:44.024 --> 03:46.494
HE COUGHED...

03:46.527 --> 03:48.362
AFTER WHICH
THE RESPIRATORY ORGAN

03:48.396 --> 03:52.333
WHICH RESIDED IN HIS CHEST
RESIDED IN HIS MOUTH...

03:52.366 --> 03:54.268
ACTUALLY, HIS HAND.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.003
WELL, HIS MOUTH,
THEN HIS HAND.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.005
(Foreman)
BATHROOM'S CLEAN.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.041
WHAT'S IN THIS?
JUST SODA.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.944
MIND IF I HAVE SOME?
YOU WANT MY DRINK?

04:03.977 --> 04:06.013
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

04:06.046 --> 04:07.548
UH, YEAH.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.782
ACTUALLY, I DO.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.418
YOU BARGE
INTO OUR ROOM,

04:10.451 --> 04:12.052
START LOOKING THROUGH
OUR PERSONAL, PRIVATE STUFF,

04:12.085 --> 04:13.754
DEMAND I HACK
INTO A COMPUTER

04:13.787 --> 04:15.623
I THINK I CAN SAFELY ASSUME
DOESN'T BELONG--

04:15.656 --> 04:17.925
[gunshot]

04:17.958 --> 04:20.494
OH, I'M SORRY.
DID I BREAK YOUR CONCENTRATION?

04:20.528 --> 04:22.630
PLEASE CONTINUE.

04:22.663 --> 04:26.367
YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT PERSONAL PRIVACY.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.338
WHAT, YOU'RE FINISHED?

04:30.371 --> 04:32.573
WELL, ALLOW ME TO RETORT.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.807
(woman)
WAIT A SECOND.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.043
YOU'RE SAYING
THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED?

04:36.076 --> 04:37.978
ABSOLUTELY.

04:38.011 --> 04:41.349
(boy)
YOU'RE LYING.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.851
INTERESTING THEORY.
CAN YOU PROVE IT?

04:43.884 --> 04:46.053
DOCTORS DON'T CARRY GUNS.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.655
THEY DON'T SHOOT PEOPLE,

04:47.688 --> 04:50.324
AND THEY DEFINITELY
DON'T SEARCH PATIENTS' HOMES.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.360
PLUS, I'VE SEEN
PULP FICTION--

04:52.393 --> 04:54.362
THE MOVIE
YOU'RE TOTALLY RIPPING OFF.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.599
HUH.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.334
WAIT, UH, WAS
IT TIMMY MORGAN?

05:00.368 --> 05:02.670
I HAVE NO IDEA.
IT HAD TO BE HIM.

05:02.703 --> 05:06.840
HE'S, LIKE, TOTALLY OBSESSED
WITH OLD MOVIES.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.743
PULP FICTION IS NOT
AN OLD MOV--WHAT?

05:09.777 --> 05:11.011
SO YOU'RE HERE TO TALK

05:11.044 --> 05:12.980
TO THE PRINCIPAL
ABOUT SOMETHING TIMMY DID?

05:13.013 --> 05:14.515
(House)
WITH TIMMY.OBLEM

05:14.548 --> 05:17.918
AND EVEN IF I DID,
I AIN'T NO SNITCH.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.853
THEN WHY
ARE YOU HERE?

05:19.887 --> 05:21.489
TO DIG MYSELF
OUT OF A HOLE.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.625
INSTEAD I DUG
A BIGGER ONE.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.527
WHAT'D YOU DO?

05:26.560 --> 05:27.595
WHAT'D YOU DO?

05:27.628 --> 05:30.731
WHAT'D YOU DO?

05:30.764 --> 05:33.601
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR EYE?

05:33.634 --> 05:35.869
IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

05:35.903 --> 05:39.039
ACTUALLY, IT'S NONE OF YOURS.
I'M A DOCTOR.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.073
IT'S A FEW DAYS OLD,

05:40.107 --> 05:42.610
SO THAT'S NOT
WHY YOU'RE HERE,

05:42.643 --> 05:45.479
UNLESS YOU TWO GOT BUSTED
FOR SOME SORT OF REVENGE PLOT.

05:45.513 --> 05:48.549
BUT THEN YOU'D LOOK ANGRY
INSTEAD OF...ASHAMED.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.783
I'M NOT ASHAMED.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.051
(House)
INTERESTING.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.554
YOU DEFENSIVELY INSIST
THAT YOU'RE NOT ASHAMED,

05:53.587 --> 05:55.155
WHICH, OF COURSE,
MEANS YOU ARE ASHAMED.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.157
AND YET,
YOU'RE THE VICTIM.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.693
YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW SHE GOT THE BLACK EYE?

05:59.727 --> 06:02.463
TELL US WHY
YOU'RE HERE FIRST.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.964
ANYONE EVER TELL YOU
YOU'RE ANNOYING?

06:03.997 --> 06:04.965
NO.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.934
YES, ALL THE TIME.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.135
BUT HE'S RIGHT.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.838
YOU WANT TO KNOW?
YOU FIRST.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.142
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.945
I HAVE TO BE HERE,
SO I FIGURED

06:17.978 --> 06:20.448
I'D PUNCH UP THE STAKES
IN THE FIRST ACT.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.583
BUT WE DID,
AND ALMOST ALWAYS DO,

06:22.616 --> 06:24.084
SEARCH THE PATIENT'S HOME.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.753
AND IF WE
TELL THEM FIRST,

06:25.786 --> 06:28.456
THEN THEY CAN HIDE SOMETHING
THAT WE NEED TO KNOW

06:28.489 --> 06:30.824
IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.926
WHY WOULD THEY HIDE SOMETHING
THAT COULD BE KILLING THEM?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.795
BECAUSE THEY ARE MORONS.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.930
THEY'RE ALL MORONS,
AND EVERYBODY LIES.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.131
(boy)
WAIT, IF EVERYBODY LIES,

06:38.165 --> 06:40.834
THEN THAT MEANS
YOU'RE LYING RIGHT NOW.

06:40.868 --> 06:45.773
I DIDN'T SAY EVERYBODY
ALWAYS LIES...ARISTOTLE.

06:45.806 --> 06:49.777
AND ON THAT NOTE, UNLESS
THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS...

06:49.810 --> 06:50.911
GOOD.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.880
OH, DR. HOURANI...

06:52.913 --> 06:55.883
BEFORE YOU FINISH,

06:55.916 --> 06:57.985
MAYBE YOU COULD DESCRIBE
WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO.

06:58.018 --> 07:02.890
YOU KNOW, LIKE IF SOMEONE COMES
IN FOR A ROUTINE PHYSICAL?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.897
YOU WANT ROUTINE?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.765
PLEASE.

07:11.799 --> 07:15.435
IT JUST FEELS
KIND OF, LIKE, NUMB.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.506
YOU DO A LOT
OF BICYCLE RIDING?

07:18.539 --> 07:20.741
NO.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.510
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN MARRIED?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.778
IT'S 12 YEARS
NEXT MONTH.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.847
YOU HAVE SIX KIDS.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.749
MM-HMM.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.083
WELL, YOU DON'T THINK
IT COULD HAVE

07:30.117 --> 07:31.752
ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THAT, DO YOU?

07:31.785 --> 07:34.187
PROBABLY.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.490
HOW OFTEN DO YOU USE
YOUR VIBRATOR?

07:36.524 --> 07:38.892
EXCUSE ME?

07:38.926 --> 07:41.495
YOUR BATTERY-OPERATED
BRAD PITT.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.664
AFTER GIVING
THE GIFT OF LIFE

07:43.697 --> 07:44.898
TO SIX EIGHT-POUND,
FOUR-OUNCE WRECKING BALLS,

07:44.932 --> 07:48.902
I THINK I CAN SAFELY ASSUME IT'S
AN INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH MODEL?

07:48.936 --> 07:51.171
DR. HOURANI, PLEASE.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.042
YOU WANTED ROUTINE.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.944
AM I DONE?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.846
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST MOVE ON.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.147
NO PROBLEM.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.749
(Ms. Corwin)
I MEANT WITH YOUR TYPICAL DAY.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.951
I ASSUME YOU SEE
MORE THAN ONE PATIENT?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.953
NOPE.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.557
OKAY.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.893
THEN I GUESS WE WILL MOVE ON
TO OUR NEXT GUEST.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.962
WAIT, IF YOU
ONLY SEE ONE PATIENT,

08:14.995 --> 08:16.864
WHAT DO YOU DO
THE REST OF THE DAY?

08:23.971 --> 08:26.540
DR. HOURANI?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.784
JUST IN TIME
FOR LUNCH.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.619
BY LUNCH, YOU MEAN A CONFERENCE
CALL WITH THE BOARD,

08:38.652 --> 08:42.823
AND BY JUST IN TIME,
YOU MEAN, 20 MINUTES LATE.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.158
I MEANT SEX...

08:45.192 --> 08:47.027
BY LUNCH.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.764
HOW ABOUT WE START
WITH A SMALL TOSSED SALAD?

08:50.798 --> 08:54.067
AS OF THIS MORNING,
I'M ON A DIET.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.278
MEANING?

09:05.312 --> 09:07.681
I TOLD YOU,
I'M BUSY.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.049
NO, YOU TOLD ME
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BUSY

09:09.082 --> 09:10.150
20 MINUTES AGO.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.052
BUT YOU WERE OBVIOUSLY ABLE
TO PUT THEM OFF THEN,

09:12.085 --> 09:13.921
THERE'S NO REASON YOU
CAN'T PUT THEM OFF NOW.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.856
HOW ABOUT,
"I WANTED TO THEN,

09:15.889 --> 09:18.959
AND NOW I DON'T"?

09:18.992 --> 09:20.861
GET YOUR FINGER
OFF MY PHONE.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.030
WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE
SOMETHING WE NEED TO DISCUSS.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.998
NOW IS NOT
A GOOD TIME.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.066
IF YOU'RE MAD
BECAUSE YOU DON'T FEEL

09:26.099 --> 09:28.035
YOU'RE GETTING THE NECESSARY
AMOUNT OF AFFECTION,

09:28.068 --> 09:29.903
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS ASK.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.039
SERIOUSLY,
NOT NOW.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.241
IF MEMORY SERVES, I ENJOYED
A HEALTHY SUNDAY BRUNCH.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.176
SO YOUR INSINUATION--

09:36.209 --> 09:37.177
OW!

09:37.210 --> 09:39.179
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
YOU!

09:39.212 --> 09:41.048
YOU ARE MY PROBLEM.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.184
YOU ARE THE MOST SELFISH,
SELF-CENTERED SON OF A BITCH

09:44.217 --> 09:45.919
ON THE FACE
OF THE PLANET.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.188
AND I'M SICK OF IT.

09:48.221 --> 09:51.925
I'M JUST...DONE.

09:51.959 --> 09:55.362
I CAN'T DEAL
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.997
[dialing phone number]

10:04.104 --> 10:07.741
SO THAT'S WHAT A TYPICAL DOCTOR
DOES ON A TYPICAL DAY.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.843
ANY QUESTIONS?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.384
WHAT'S A VIBRATOR?

10:27.795 --> 10:29.730
WHY WAS
YOUR GIRLFRIEND SO MAD?

10:29.763 --> 10:30.898
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.066
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
IT MATTERS.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.935
I MEAN, IF SHE'S
YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

10:34.968 --> 10:36.904
YOU SHOULD CARE
HOW SHE FEELS.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.239
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T MATTER
TO THE STORY.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.875
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF THE STORY.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.377
IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT DOES MATTER.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.247
YOU DON'T KISS HER ENOUGH--
IS THAT THE PROBLEM?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.949
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.118
WHICH, BY YOUR DEFINITION,
MEANS IT IS.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.188
WE KISS PLENTY.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.257
YOUR TURN.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.692
THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

10:58.726 --> 10:59.927
YOUR TURN.

10:59.960 --> 11:03.063
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

11:03.096 --> 11:04.331
EXCUSE ME.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.000
WHEN EXACTLY
WILL THE COMMANDANT BE BACK?

11:07.034 --> 11:09.269
SHOULDN'T BE
MUCH LONGER, SIR.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.977
WELL?

11:19.847 --> 11:21.314
OH, SO NOW
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TALK.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.317
THAT'S REAL MATURE.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.888
(Zack)
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.190
WE GOT BUSTED FOR KISSING
BEHIND THE SCHOOL.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.125
NOW YOU KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.127
SO TELL US
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.863
THE DEAL WAS
ABOUT THE BLACK EYE.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.031
AND WE DIDN'T KISS.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.268
SO YOU WERE JUST MAKING
HIM BEG, HUH?

11:41.301 --> 11:42.970
I DIDN'T HAVE YOU PEGGED
AS A TEASE.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.204
I'M NOT A TEASE.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.339
THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE
SUGGESTS OTHERWISE.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.908
I'M NOT A TEASE.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.042
PROVE IT...

11:52.012 --> 11:55.849
BY--BY TELLING ME
YOUR STORY.

12:01.855 --> 12:02.790
YOU'RE
A PATHETIC LOSER, JERK!

12:02.823 --> 12:05.092
AND I WOULDN'T KISS YOU
IF I HAD BRAIN CANCER

12:05.125 --> 12:08.061
AND YOUR LIPS
WERE THE CURE!

12:12.065 --> 12:13.300
SHE ACTUALLY
SAID THAT?

12:13.333 --> 12:16.169
WELL, YEAH, THAT WAS,
LIKE, TWO DAYS AGO.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.939
I CLEARLY DIDN'T LEAD HIM ALONG
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

12:18.972 --> 12:21.508
WHICH PROVES
I'M NOT A TEASE.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.844
SO WHY IS YOUR GIRLFRIEND
MAD AT YOU?

12:23.877 --> 12:26.346
I'M GETTING
A KIND OF BOSSY VIBE.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.048
I TAKE IT
YOU'RE INTO THAT.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.017
DON'T ANSWER!

12:30.050 --> 12:31.785
YOUR TURN.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.522
[coughing]

12:35.555 --> 12:37.891
WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE PROBLEM, SIR?

12:37.925 --> 12:39.359
I'M HAVING
MORE DIFFICULTY BREATHING

12:39.392 --> 12:41.028
AND SOME PAIN IN MY CHEST.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.896
YOU'RE NEW,
AREN'T YOU?

12:42.930 --> 12:43.997
[coughing]

12:44.031 --> 12:45.999
UH, YEAH, I JUST MOVED
FROM CHICAGO.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.567
CHICAGO'S AWESOME.
WHAT PART ARE YOU FROM?

12:47.600 --> 12:50.203
[coughing]

12:50.237 --> 12:51.571
WE NEED TO GET
A CHEST C.T.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.073
EXCUSE ME,
I'M THE SENIOR TEAM MEMBER,

12:53.106 --> 12:54.374
WHICH MEANS
WE DON'T NEED ANYTHING

12:54.407 --> 12:56.209
UNLESS I SAY WE NEED IT.
[coughing]

12:56.243 --> 12:59.579
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE
AN AFFAIR?
YOU WANT
TO HAVE A THREESOME?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.549
YOU CAN'T TALK TO HER LIKE THAT.
I'M TELLING CUDDY.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.985
WE NEED A CHEST C.T.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.854
(both)
GET IT YOURSELF.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.989
ISN'T THAT, LIKE,
SEXUAL HARASSMENT?

13:09.022 --> 13:10.824
NOT IF YOU'RE
GOOD-LOOKING.

13:10.858 --> 13:14.027
EXCUSE ME?

13:14.061 --> 13:15.595
YOU SAID THE ONE GUY WAS SHORT
WITH A BIG NOSE.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.131
GUESS THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY THING THAT'S BIG.

13:18.165 --> 13:18.866
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

13:18.899 --> 13:21.434
IT MEANS HE'S LYING...
AGAIN.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.972
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HANDLE
THE TRUTH!

13:25.005 --> 13:28.275
(Timothy)
THAT'S SO EASY.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.979
A FEW GOOD MEN.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.947
OKAY, I GIVE UP.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.016
I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE ON

13:36.049 --> 13:37.484
TO OUR NEXT GUEST.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.020
MR. DRYDEN...

13:40.053 --> 13:44.357
UH, WORKS FOR ONE OF THE
LARGEST ADVERTISING AGENCIES

13:44.391 --> 13:46.426
IN NEW YORK CITY.
BORING!
BORING!

13:46.459 --> 13:48.428
CAN WE AT LEAST HEAR
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PATIENT?

13:48.461 --> 13:51.331
[students clamoring]

13:54.467 --> 13:57.270
IF DR. HOURANI
PROMISES TO--

13:57.304 --> 13:58.939
PATIENT'S DEAD.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.211
FLOOR IS YOURS, DON.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.113
DAVE.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.114
(Timothy)
HE'S NOT DEAD.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.149
YOU SAID EARLIER
HE WAS STILL IN THE HOSPITAL.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.184
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?
HE'S GOT A COUGH.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.285
YOU SAID
HE COUGHED UP A LUNG.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.988
WHAT ABOUT THE LAPTOP?
WHO CARES
ABOUT THE LAPTOP?

14:15.022 --> 14:17.290
YEAH, AND HE ALREADY SAID HE
WAS LYING ABOUT THAT, YOU MORON.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.458
(Ms. Corwin)
GABE...

14:18.491 --> 14:20.527
WE DO NOT USE THAT
WORD HERE.
HE DID.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.195
YEAH, AND I WAS TALKING
ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

14:22.229 --> 14:25.032
(all)
OOH.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.100
DR. HOURANI, PLEASE,

14:27.134 --> 14:31.204
COULD YOU JUST FINISH,
QUICKLY, SO WE CAN MOVE ON?

14:35.042 --> 14:39.146
[medical alarms blaring]

14:39.179 --> 14:40.413
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG.

14:40.447 --> 14:43.316
HE WAS STABLE FOR A WHILE, AND
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE JUST--

14:43.350 --> 14:44.517
(Masters)
BRONCHIAL INFECTION MUST BE

14:44.551 --> 14:46.486
FROM A DRUG-RESISTANT
STRAIN.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.155
O-2 SATS
ARE PLUMMETING.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.490
[coughing]
WE NEED TO GET HIM
ON A BRONCHODILATOR

14:50.523 --> 14:52.592
BEFORE HE GOES
INTO RESPIRATORY ARREST.
SUCTION, SIT HIM UP.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.128
START BLOW BY OXYGEN.

14:55.162 --> 14:58.198
[coughing, gagging]

14:58.231 --> 15:01.334
[moaning, breathing heavily]

15:01.368 --> 15:06.106
WHAT IS THAT?

15:06.139 --> 15:08.675
I THINK IT'S HIS...

15:08.708 --> 15:11.344
IT'S HIS LUNG.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.053
THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.055
(House)
YES, IT REALLY HAPPENED.

15:22.089 --> 15:26.459
I TAKE CASES THAT OTHER DOCTORS
FAIL TO DIAGNOSE,

15:26.493 --> 15:28.628
WHICH IS WHY I ONLY
TAKE ONE AT A TIME.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.663
MY CURRENT PATIENT
IS A COLLEGE STUDENT.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.299
HE'S ACTUALLY
IN THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW.

15:32.332 --> 15:36.469
AND, YES, HE REALLY
DID COUGH UP A LARGE PORTION

15:36.503 --> 15:38.205
OF DEAD LUNG TISSUE.

15:38.238 --> 15:41.074
HOW'S THAT
EVEN POSSIBLE?

15:41.108 --> 15:44.211
THAT'S WHAT
SHE SAID.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.214
NO, SHE DID
LITERALLY SAY THAT.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.216
HOW'S THAT
EVEN POSSIBLE?

15:49.249 --> 15:51.184
PRIMARY SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA
COULD CAUSE

15:51.218 --> 15:52.519
LUNG TISSUE
TO BASICALLY DISINTEGRATE.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.221
IT'S NOT CANCER.
F.O.B. WAS NORMAL.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.522
(Chase)
IT'S NOT AN INFECTION EITHER.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.524
BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS
HAVEN'T HAD ANY EFFECT.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.292
WHO PASSWORD-PROTECTS
A COMPUTER

15:59.326 --> 16:02.295
THEY KEEP IN A LOCKED DESK
IN A LOCKED OFFICE?

16:02.329 --> 16:03.696
SOMEONE WHO WORKS WITH SOMEONE
WHO THINKS IT'S OKAY

16:03.730 --> 16:04.897
TO BREAK
INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S HOMES?

16:04.931 --> 16:08.101
(Foreman)
AN AMEBIC LIVER ABSCESS
COULD RUPTURE

16:08.135 --> 16:10.137
THROUGH THE DIAPHRAGM
INTO THE THORAX.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.639
NOT WHEN HIS LIVER-FUNCTION
TESTS ARE ALL NORMAL.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.242
HIS DORM MATES ARE
COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJORS.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.344
IF THEY'RE FABRICATING CHIPS,
THEY COULD BE WORKING

16:17.377 --> 16:19.279
WITH ALL KINDS
OF DIFFERENT TOXIC SOLVENTS.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.415
WE NEED TO SEARCH
THE DORM.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.284
"WE"?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.553
OUI.
ALLONS-Y.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.188
WHILE WE'RE OUT,

16:28.221 --> 16:29.756
DO A THORASCOPIC LUNG BIOPSY

16:29.789 --> 16:31.324
AND A C-ANCA,

16:31.358 --> 16:33.326
BECAUSE
IT'S SARCOIDOSIS.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.296
(Taub)
BUT IF YOU THINK IT'S
SARCOIDOSIS, WHY ARE YOU...

16:36.329 --> 16:39.299
SO YOU REALLY DID FORCE
HIS ROOMMATE

16:39.332 --> 16:40.467
TO HACK INTO THE LAPTOP?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.469
WHY WOULD I LIE?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.171
BUT WHOSE
LAPTOP IS IT?

16:44.204 --> 16:45.638
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S,
ISN'T IT?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.607
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.776
I'M JUST INTERESTED IN HER
BECAUSE SHE'S A CLIENT,

16:49.809 --> 16:51.778
AND SHE SLEEPS
ABOVE HER COVERS--

16:51.811 --> 16:54.214
FOUR FEET
ABOVE HER COVERS.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.715
WHAT?

16:55.748 --> 16:57.417
GHOSTBUSTERS.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.286
SO THAT'S
WHY SHE'S SO MAD--

16:59.319 --> 17:01.188
YOU LOOKED THROUGH
HER COMPUTER?

17:01.221 --> 17:04.091
NO, THAT PART HAPPENED
AFTER SHE GOT MAD.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.392
FIRST SHE GOT MAD.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.428
THEN I STOLE HER COMPUTER
TO FIX THINGS.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.663
AND THEN
WE GOT THE CASE.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.300
WAIT, SO YOU TRIED TO FIX
YOUR RELATIONSHIP

17:13.333 --> 17:15.202
BY STEALING
HER COMPUTER?

17:15.235 --> 17:18.505
WELL, WHEN YOU
SAY IT LIKE THAT...

17:18.538 --> 17:20.407
YES.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.276
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE THE MORON.

17:23.310 --> 17:27.380
(all)
OOH!

17:52.772 --> 17:55.608
I CAN ALSO GET THREE SETS
OF GOLF CLUBS IN THERE.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.259
(Timothy)
NO WAY.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.261
YOU DIDN'T GET
HER LAPTOP

18:14.294 --> 18:16.429
BY BLOWING DOWN
THE DOOR OF HER OFFICE.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.365
THAT'S FROM
THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT.

18:18.398 --> 18:22.602
JUST SEEING IF YOU'RE
STILL PAYING ATTENTION.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.305
IT WAS ACTUALLY
MORE SUBTLE.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.712
THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR--

18:32.745 --> 18:34.414
THE STEVE MCQUEEN VERSION.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.384
JUST TELL US THE TRUTH
ALREADY.
(Dryden)
EXCUSE ME.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.786
BUT THERE ARE OTHERS HERE WHO
WOULD LIKE A CHANCE TO SPEAK.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.588
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.756
(all)
NO!

18:46.193 --> 18:48.695
AUDIENCE IS
ALWAYS RIGHT.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.700
[scoffs]
LUKE.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.369
IT WASN'T ME.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.472
MA'AM,
ARE YOU OKAY?

18:59.506 --> 19:01.374
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:01.408 --> 19:04.744
OOH, WHAT'S
THAT SMELL?

19:04.777 --> 19:06.313
UGH.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.718
[Southern accent]
SMELLS LIKE A GAS LEAK.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.486
(woman)
CALL DR. CUDDY.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.723
[commotion]

19:19.859 --> 19:22.862
(woman)
YOU POISONED
A ROOM FULL OF PATIENTS

19:22.895 --> 19:25.332
SO YOU COULD STEAL
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S LAPTOP?

19:25.365 --> 19:27.534
I DIDN'T POISON ANYBODY.

19:27.567 --> 19:31.704
I SPILLED SOME HYDROGEN SULFIDE
AND AMMONIA ON THE FLOOR,

19:31.738 --> 19:34.341
THINKING THE STENCH
WOULD CLEAR THE PLACE OUT.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.443
BUT INSTEAD OF BREATHING
THROUGH HIS NOSE,

19:36.476 --> 19:39.246
SOME IDIOT
DECIDED TO HOLD HIS BREATH.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.248
HE PASSES OUT,
AND BEFORE I KNOW IT,

19:41.281 --> 19:46.953
THE PLACE IS A PERFECT STORM
OF MASS HYSTERIA...

19:46.986 --> 19:48.788
ALTHOUGH IT WORKED OUT
JUST AS WELL.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.423
(Colleen)
THEY'RE MORONS.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.225
AGREED.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.361
NO, NOT THE PATIENTS,
THE KIDS.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.296
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW YOU STOLE IT.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.797
WHAT MATTERS IS WHY.

19:57.830 --> 20:01.401
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE STARTING
TO REMIND ME OF SOMEONE.

20:01.434 --> 20:04.371
I DIDN'T ASK HOW YOU STOLE IT.
I ASKED WHY.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.906
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

20:06.939 --> 20:08.408
YOU THINK YOU CAN TELL
WHY SHE'S MAD

20:08.441 --> 20:09.742
BY READING
BUDGET SPREADSHEETS

20:09.776 --> 20:11.911
AND PER DIEM SCHEDULES?

20:11.944 --> 20:13.380
I KNOW WHY SHE'S MAD.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.348
WHAT I NEED TO KNOW IS
HOW TO MAKE HER UN-MAD.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.250
AND STEP ONE
IS GAINING ACCESS

20:17.284 --> 20:18.551
TO THE JOURNAL
ON HER LAPTOP,

20:18.585 --> 20:21.454
WHERE SHE RECORDS
HER INNERMOST THOUGHTS...

20:21.488 --> 20:23.823
INSTEAD OF JUST
WATCHING PORN WITH ME.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.559
OH, GROW UP.

20:26.593 --> 20:30.463
IF PORN WAS BAD, WHY WOULD
THERE BE SO MANY NUNS IN IT?

20:30.497 --> 20:32.465
WHY IS SHE MAD?

20:32.499 --> 20:33.600
(House)
I WAS MYSELF,

20:33.633 --> 20:35.268
WHICH, BY THE WAY,

20:35.302 --> 20:37.804
SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.772
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.674
WE HAD A GREAT WEEKEND.

20:41.708 --> 20:45.645
WENT TO A BLUES CLUB,
WE WATCHED CINDERFELLA ON DVD.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.679
AND?

20:46.713 --> 20:48.548
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.017
SHE'S BEING UNREASONABLE,
AND I HAVE TO FIX IT.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.485
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S
REALLY IMPORTANT TO HER.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.021
I NEED SOMETHING BIG.
BECAUSE?

20:55.054 --> 20:57.924
WE'RE PAST THAT.

20:59.959 --> 21:03.596
HAVE YOU TRIED
CHILDHOOD PET NAMES?

21:03.630 --> 21:04.931
I DON'T KNOW HER PETS.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.399
SHE'S NEVER MENTIONED
A PET?

21:06.433 --> 21:10.503
WELL, YEAH,
BUT I WASN'T LISTENING.

21:10.537 --> 21:13.540
SHE'S NOT MAD BECAUSE I DON'T
REMEMBER A DEAD DOG'S NAME.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.909
HER FIRST DOG
WAS RONALDO.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.746
IS THAT R-O
OR R-E-Y?

21:19.779 --> 21:22.415
I DIDN'T ASK. TRY BOTH.
[knock at door]

21:22.449 --> 21:24.317
JUST GOT A CASE
FROM THE E.R.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.251
RUTGERS STUDENT CAME IN

21:25.284 --> 21:27.053
WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE
ACUTE BRONCHITIS.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.055
BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN
HIS BLOOD OR SPUTUM CULTURES.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.289
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S TIME YOU PEOPLE

21:30.323 --> 21:32.559
STOP LOOKING TO THE WHITE MAN
TO SOLVE ALL YOUR PROBLEMS?

21:32.592 --> 21:33.993
HIS O-2 SATS
ARE IN THE TOILET.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.595
IF WE DON'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S ATTACKING HIS--

21:35.628 --> 21:36.963
SO FIGURE IT OUT!

21:36.996 --> 21:38.998
I'M BUSY.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.504
(girl)
THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.406
WHY NOT?

21:46.439 --> 21:51.378
'CAUSE IF HE WAS DYING--
I MEAN, YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

21:53.413 --> 21:56.649

21:56.683 --> 21:59.686
NOT ALL OF THEM
ARE INTERESTING.

22:12.131 --> 22:15.101
YOU STILL HAVEN'T ANSWERED
EITHER QUESTION.

22:15.134 --> 22:18.838
SHE WAS MAD BECAUSE SHE'S
GENETICALLY PROGRAMMED

22:18.871 --> 22:21.007
TO MAKE A BIG DEAL
OUT OF EVERY LITTLE THING.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.076
SO SHE'S MAD
'CAUSE SHE'S A GIRL.

22:24.110 --> 22:27.714
AND NOW SHE'S MAD
BECAUSE SHE'S PROGRAMMED

22:27.747 --> 22:30.717
TO MAKE A BIG DEAL
OUT OF EVERY LITTLE THING.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.953
ACTUALLY, SHE'S
NOT LIKE THAT.
WHY ARE YOU
STICKING UP FOR HER?

22:33.986 --> 22:36.155
SHE SAYS YOU'RE A PATHETIC JERK
AND SHE HATES YOU.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.090
THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.526
IT WAS
TWO DAYS AGO.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.428
AND IT WASN'T
EVEN TRUE THEN.

22:41.461 --> 22:44.096
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW YOU THINK.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.132
[scoffs]
REALLY?

22:46.165 --> 22:47.567
REALLY.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.403
REALLY?

[children cheering]

23:05.685 --> 23:06.653
HEY.

23:06.686 --> 23:09.121
UH, AND NO PECK
ON THE CHEEK.

23:09.155 --> 23:12.825
IT HAS TO BE
ON THE LIPS.

23:12.859 --> 23:15.728
(House)
WINNING A BET
TO FORCE HER TO KISS YOU

23:15.762 --> 23:17.129
ACTUALLY CUTS
AGAINST YOUR THEORY

23:17.163 --> 23:18.665
THAT YOU KNOW
HOW SHE THINKS.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.199
I WASN'T FORCING HER
TO DO ANYTHING

23:20.232 --> 23:22.034
THAT SHE
DIDN'T WANT TO DO.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.971
YOU'RE HOPING FOR A CAREER
IN THE NBA OR THE NFL?

23:25.004 --> 23:26.706
THE BET LET HER DO
WHAT SHE WANTED TO DO

23:26.739 --> 23:28.575
WHILE STILL BEING ABLE TO ACT
LIKE SHE DIDN'T,

23:28.608 --> 23:29.942
SO HER FRIENDS
WOULDN'T GET ALL, LIKE,

23:29.976 --> 23:31.944
CALLING HER A SLUT
OR SOMETHING.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.647
NOT THAT IT'S SLUTTY
OR ANYTHING.

23:34.681 --> 23:37.183
IT'S JUST A KISS.

23:37.216 --> 23:40.987
NOT EVEN CLOSE TO TRUE.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.689
[sighs]

23:42.722 --> 23:46.225
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE
I'D LOSE.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.860
AH, NOW WE'RE GETTING
SOMEWHERE.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.197
NO, WE'RE NOT.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.132
OH, I THOUGHT WE WERE.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.534
NO, YOU THOUGHT
WE WEREN'T,

23:54.567 --> 23:56.035
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WANT,

23:56.068 --> 23:59.772
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO
TELL US WHY WAS SHE MAD AT YOU!

24:02.509 --> 24:03.876
YOU TELL US YOU DON'T
WANT TO DO YOUR JOB

24:03.910 --> 24:04.977
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO BUSY
TRYING TO BREAK

24:05.011 --> 24:07.079
INTO YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S LAPTOP
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

24:07.113 --> 24:08.581
TO MAKE HER
NOT MAD AT YOU.

24:08.615 --> 24:09.849
BUT YOU DON'T TELL US

24:09.882 --> 24:12.485
WHY SHE WAS MAD AT YOU.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.089
IT'S STUPID.

24:17.123 --> 24:20.059
TALK.

24:27.266 --> 24:30.236
I'M OUT OF HERE.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.105
UNLESS...

24:35.107 --> 24:37.610
[chuckles]
RACHEL'S GONNA BE UP SOON.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.012
WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.

24:40.046 --> 24:43.115
YES, I DO.

24:43.149 --> 24:47.286
CAN YOU TAKE THE GARBAGE OUT
BEFORE YOU GO?

24:47.319 --> 24:50.156
UH, I-I-I WOULD,
BUT...

24:50.189 --> 24:52.892
OH, COME ON.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.293
IT'S NOT A LOT.

24:54.326 --> 24:58.230
PAIN'S ALWAYS WORST

25:11.310 --> 25:14.513
(Rachel)
MOMMY!

25:34.300 --> 25:37.069
(Colleen)
YOU USED HER TOOTHBRUSH?

25:37.103 --> 25:38.805
(Zack)
THAT'S SO GROSS.

25:38.838 --> 25:41.307
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

25:41.340 --> 25:42.709
IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE HAD A PROBLEM

25:42.742 --> 25:44.176
SWAPPING SPIT
THE NIGHT BEFORE.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.178
WELL, MAYBE IT'S NOT
THE SWAPPING SPIT

25:46.212 --> 25:49.315
THAT BOTHERS HER, BUT THE FACT
THAT YOU DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

25:49.348 --> 25:50.917
HAD SHE WARNED
YOU NOT TO DO IT?

25:50.950 --> 25:52.151
OH, I LISTEN TO HER.

25:52.184 --> 25:53.786
BUT YOU JUST SAID BEFORE
THAT YOU DIDN'T.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.121
NO, I SAID I DIDN'T REMEMBER
WHAT SHE SAID.

25:55.154 --> 25:56.956
NO, YOU SAID YOU
DON'T LISTEN--

25:56.989 --> 25:59.992
I LISTEN TO HER.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.093
OKAY?

26:01.127 --> 26:02.328
BELIEVE ME, I LISTEN.

26:02.361 --> 26:05.264
[movie music plays]

26:05.297 --> 26:06.298
(Cuddy)
IT'S MY TOOTHBRUSH,

26:06.332 --> 26:09.001
AND IT'S NOT JUST ONCE.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.303
AND IT'S NOT
LIKE I'D EVEN CARE,

26:11.337 --> 26:15.842
BUT YOU TOTALLY
DESTROY IT.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.376
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BRUSH WITH IT,

26:17.409 --> 26:19.378
NOT GNAW ON IT
LIKE A RAWHIDE BONE.

26:19.411 --> 26:23.082
I THINK
MISS FOUR CAVITIES' TIME

26:23.115 --> 26:25.317
WOULD BE BETTER SPENT COPYING
MR. NO CAVITIES

26:25.351 --> 26:28.020
INSTEAD OF
COMPLAINING ABOUT HIM.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.189
AND GIVEN WHAT
I'D JUST BEEN DOING,

26:30.222 --> 26:31.891
I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME
GOING OUT TO DINNER

26:31.924 --> 26:34.293
WITHOUT A GOOD BRUSH
AND A FLOSS.

26:34.326 --> 26:37.764
WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST USE
THE TOOTHBRUSH I BOUGHT YOU?

26:37.797 --> 26:41.367
WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST SHUT UP
AND WATCH THE MOVIE?

26:44.403 --> 26:48.374
I SAID, "PLEASE."

26:48.407 --> 26:50.710
WHY WOULD YOU HAVE
TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH

26:50.743 --> 26:52.679
BEFORE YOU GO TO DINNER?

26:52.712 --> 26:54.346
YOU DON'T WANT
TO KNOW...

26:54.380 --> 26:55.247
YET.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.049
YOU'RE GROSS
AND DUMB.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.018
YOU LISTEN
TO WHAT SHE SAYS

26:59.051 --> 27:01.253
JUST SO YOU CAN TELL HER
HOW WRONG SHE IS.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.122
YOU ARE CLUELESS
AND NAIVE.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.692
I HAVE TO TELL HER
THAT SHE'S WRONG,

27:05.725 --> 27:07.393
'CAUSE NO ONE ELSE WILL.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.428
SHE'S THE BOSS,

27:09.461 --> 27:11.430

SHE'S SURROUNDED BY MORONS

WHO ARE EITHER AFRAID OF HER,

27:13.265 --> 27:14.734
OR THEY WANT
TO KISS UP TO HER,

27:14.767 --> 27:17.436
OR THEY WANT TO...

27:17.469 --> 27:19.438
KISS HER.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.874
BUT NOT YOU.
(House)
I ALREADY KISSED HER.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.375
AND I RESPECT HER ENOUGH
NOT TO TREAT HER

WHO NEEDS TO BE CODDLED.

27:27.013 --> 27:30.316

THINK YOU DID?

27:34.386 --> 27:36.789

YOU'RE A MORON?

IT'S WRONG

AT YOUR SERVICE.

WHERE ARE YOU NOW?
IN THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

HAVE TIME FOR GAMES.

FOR SARCOIDOSIS.
GREAT.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.089
MEANS THE TREATMENT'S
ALREADY WORKING.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.623
IT WOULD IF WE'D ACTUALLY
STARTED THE TREATMENT,

30:24.656 --> 30:27.293
BUT WE DIDN'T.
WHY THE HELL NOT?

30:27.326 --> 30:28.961
BECAUSE IT'S
NOT SARCOIDOSIS.

YOU WOULD KNOW THAT.

ABOUT THE F.N.A.

HE RESPONDS TO THE TREATMENT.

JUST DO IT.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.446
IS A DIAGNOSIS
OF EXCLUSION,

WHO SPEND THEIR TIME

30:49.481 --> 30:51.650
EXCLUDING WHAT IT ISN'T
USUALLY CAUSE THEIR PATIENTS

30:51.683 --> 30:54.120
TO DIE FROM WHAT IT IS.

30:54.153 --> 30:55.387
I DON'T GET IT.

WHY WOULD YOU LIE
ABOUT YOUR NAME?

IN HER JOURNAL?

30:59.658 --> 31:01.627

MY POINT.

EVER BELIEVE ME?

WHAT?

JUST BECAUSE HE'S DYING
DOESN'T MAKE IT INTERESTING.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.539
YOU CHEATED ON HER,
DIDN'T YOU?

31:13.572 --> 31:15.507
NO, I DIDN'T CHEAT
ON HER.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.609
IT'S OBVIOUSLY MORE THAN
JUST YOU USED HER TOOTHBRUSH

31:17.643 --> 31:19.511
AND WOULDN'T TAKE
THE GARBAGE OUT.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.949
NO, ACTUALLY,
IT WAS EXACTLY THAT.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.616
I JUST NEED
SOME TIME ALONE.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.286
BECAUSE I USED
YOUR TOOTHBRUSH?

31:27.319 --> 31:30.022
AND YOU WOULDN'T TAKE OUT
THE GARBAGE.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.358
THAT'S INSANE.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.659
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

31:33.692 --> 31:36.662
YOU DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT, ALWAYS.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.664
I SAID I WAS SORRY.
I WAS--

31:38.697 --> 31:40.466
I WAS STILL HALF ASLEEP.
I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.068
AND YOU'RE
ALWAYS RIGHT.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.402
AND I DON'T MEAN YOU
ALWAYS THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.272
BUT Y-YOU ARE
ACTUALLY ALWAYS RIGHT,

31:46.305 --> 31:48.374
BECAUSE THAT'S
ALL THAT MATTERS.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.110
THAT DOESN'T
EVEN MAKE SENSE.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.045
WHAT, YOU WANT ME
TO BE WRONG?

31:53.079 --> 31:55.514
I WANT YOU TO CARE ABOUT
MORE THAN JUST WHAT YOU WANT,

31:55.547 --> 31:58.050
WHAT YOU THINK.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.651
YOU NEED ME, HOUSE.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.988
AND YOU MAY EVEN LOVE ME.

32:02.021 --> 32:05.557
BUT YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT ME.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.928
AND I DESERVE
SOMEONE WHO DOES.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.674
(Colleen)
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.543
YOU DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.712
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.747
YES, I DID.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.317
WELL, I WASN'T
LISTENING, THEN.

32:31.350 --> 32:32.684
[sighs]

32:32.718 --> 32:35.254
BUT YOU FOUND A WAY
TO FIX THINGS, RIGHT?

32:35.287 --> 32:37.089
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE HAPPY
WHEN YOU READ HER LAPTOP.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.391
I DID.

32:39.425 --> 32:42.061
AT LEAST
I THOUGHT I DID.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.196
SHE RECENTLY GOT
THE THIN ENVELOPE

32:44.230 --> 32:46.732
FROM HER FIRST CHOICE
PRESCHOOL.

32:46.765 --> 32:50.402
BUT IT TURNS OUT
IT WAS HER FAKE FIRST CHOICE,

32:50.436 --> 32:52.271
'CAUSE SHE WAS CONVINCED
SHE COULDN'T GET HER KID

32:52.304 --> 32:53.405
INTO HER ACTUAL FIRST CHOICE

32:53.439 --> 32:58.444
WITHOUT A SUBSTANTIAL DONATION
OR AN INSIDE CONNECTION.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.613
IF IT'S BRYE PARK,
I'M AFRAID SHE'S RIGHT.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.782
WAIT, THAT'S
OUR SCHOOL.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.085
WHAT OTHER SCHOOL
WOULD HE BE TALKING ABOUT?

33:06.118 --> 33:08.754
JUST FINISH
THE STORY.

33:08.787 --> 33:11.090
YOU KNOW,
I GOT TO TELL YOU--

33:11.123 --> 33:13.192
THERE IS BOSSY,
WHICH CAN BE SEXY.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.593
AND THEN
THERE'S BITCHY--

33:14.626 --> 33:16.462
FINISH THE STORY.

33:19.131 --> 33:21.433
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW THIS

33:21.467 --> 33:23.602
BECAUSE YOU'RE
ON THE SCHOOL BOARD,

33:23.635 --> 33:24.736
WHICH PUTS YOU
ON THE INSIDE,

33:24.770 --> 33:28.540
AND BEING THE CEO HERE OBVIOUSLY
CONNECTS YOU WITH CUDDY.

33:28.574 --> 33:32.111
WELL, IF WE'RE SO CONNECTED,
WHY ISN'T SHE THE ONE ASKING?

33:32.144 --> 33:33.712
BECAUSE SHE THINKS
IT'S WRONG

33:33.745 --> 33:36.548
TO USE CONNECTIONS
TO CUT IN LINE.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.016
I DON'T.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.621
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.
FANTASTIC.

33:42.654 --> 33:45.124
BUT I COULD USE
A FAVOR AS WELL.

33:45.157 --> 33:46.625
(Foreman)
WHERE ARE YOU?

33:46.658 --> 33:48.060
I NEEDED TO TAKE CARE
OF SOMETHING.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.361
IT'S NOT A FOREIGN BODY.

33:49.395 --> 33:50.529
(House)
YOU MUST HAVE MISSED IT.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.663
IF WE DO ANY MORE IMAGING,

33:51.697 --> 33:53.732
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ADD
RADIATION POISONING TO THE DDX.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.567
I MEANT
THE SARCOIDOSIS.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.203
(Masters)
THE BIOPSY AND C-ANCA

33:57.236 --> 33:58.304
WERE BOTH NEGATIVE.

33:58.337 --> 33:59.805
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO A PNEUMONECTOMY.

33:59.838 --> 34:02.308
NO SIGN OF DRUG
OR ALCOHOL ABUSE.

34:02.341 --> 34:05.244
HE'S NOT A SMOKER, A COAL MINER,
OR A POTTER--IT'S SARCOIDOSIS.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.146
START HIM ON CORTICOSTEROIDS
AND METHOTREXATE.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.481
IF IT'S A DRUG-RESISTANT BUG,
AND WE GIVE HIM STEROIDS--

34:09.515 --> 34:10.782
HE'LL DIE,

34:10.816 --> 34:12.784
WHICH FROM THE SOUND OF IT
WOULDN'T BE MUCH WORSE.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.321
[tires screeching, crash]

34:15.354 --> 34:17.623
YOU MORON.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.673
BUT YOU HAVE
TO SHOW HIM YOUR I.D.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.242
AND YOUR INSURANCE STUFF.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.177
YOU CAN'T JUST
GIVE HIM A FAKE NAME.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.878
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.681
LAST TIME I CHECKED,
THIS WAS STILL AMERICA.

34:42.714 --> 34:45.117
OF COURSE,
THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO.

34:45.151 --> 34:49.255
BUT YOU'RE GONNA PAY HIM, RIGHT?
I MEAN, IT WAS YOUR FAULT.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.889
A YELLOW LIGHT
DOES NOT MEAN STOP.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.859
IT WAS, AT THE MOST,
20% MY FAULT.

34:53.892 --> 34:56.762
SINCE INSURANCE COMPANIES
AUTOMATICALLY PUT

34:56.795 --> 34:59.431
100% OF THE FAULT
ON THE REAR-ENDER,

34:59.465 --> 35:02.634
MY LITTLE LIE
WAS ACTUALLY AN EFFORT

35:02.668 --> 35:07.273
TO ACHIEVE AN OUTCOME
CLOSER TO THE TRUTH.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.275
AND IT WOULD
HAVE WORKED, TOO,

35:09.308 --> 35:12.544
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR THOSE MEDDLING KIDS.

35:12.578 --> 35:14.746
I AM DR. HOURANI.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.216
THEN WHY DID YOU SAY
THE OTHER DOCTOR WAS HOURANI?

35:17.249 --> 35:19.885
IT'S, UH--
IT'S A COMMON NAME.

35:19.918 --> 35:22.654
IT'S LIKE SMITH...

35:22.688 --> 35:23.989
IN LEBANON.

35:24.022 --> 35:26.892
LET ME SEE YOUR I.D.
I TOLD YOU,
I LEFT IT IN MY OTHER PANTS.

35:26.925 --> 35:29.695
REALLY? 'CAUSE IT LOOKS
LIKE IT'S STILL IN THIS PAIR.
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

35:29.728 --> 35:30.696
GIVE ME YOUR I.D.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.898
HEY, WOULD YOU STOP THAT?
GIVE ME YOUR I.D.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.833
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.
[kids murmuring loudly]

35:34.866 --> 35:35.934
KIDS, STAY CALM.

35:35.967 --> 35:36.935
GIMME YOUR I.D.!

35:36.968 --> 35:38.670
STOP THIS RIGHT NOW!
STAY IN YOUR SEATS, KIDS.

35:38.704 --> 35:41.473
STAY CALM, YOU GUYS.
STAY IN YOUR SEATS.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.475
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.
THIS IS NOT THE TIME OR PLACE.

35:47.279 --> 35:51.149
IS THERE A PROBLEM IN HERE,
MS. CORWIN?

36:02.961 --> 36:04.763
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TAKE OFF?

36:04.796 --> 36:07.399
IT'S NOT LIKE THE PRINCIPAL
CAN CALL YOUR PARENTS.

36:07.433 --> 36:10.336
NO, BUT THE PRINCIPAL
CAN CALL THE POLICE

36:10.369 --> 36:12.804
OR THE GUY HE'S DOING
THE FAVOR FOR.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.374
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S
OBVIOUSLY GONNA FIND OUT.

36:15.407 --> 36:16.808
HE'S SCREWED.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.610
I'D BOLT.
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.779
YEAH, I WOULD.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.848
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

36:25.351 --> 36:27.353
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

36:37.996 --> 36:40.332
WHAT'S WRONG?

36:40.366 --> 36:41.833
I GUESS...

36:41.867 --> 36:44.403
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT
LIKE THIS.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.805
SORRY FOR SHOOTING
THE PUCK SO HARD

36:46.838 --> 36:49.708
AND TRICKING YOU
IN THE BET.

36:49.741 --> 36:52.344
YOU DIDN'T TRICK ME.
YEAH, I DID.

36:52.378 --> 36:55.247
I GAVE MADISON
A RED DEAD REVOLVER CHEAT CODE

36:55.281 --> 36:57.749
SO SHE'D HIT YOUR FOOT
WITH THE ROPE.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.854
I KNEW YOU
COULDN'T BEAT ME.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.523
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S JUST...

37:04.556 --> 37:06.892
[sighs]
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.927
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU LIKE ME TOO.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.731
BUT I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
ANY MORE GAMES.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.536
WHEN YOU WANT--
I MEAN, IF YOU EVER WANT TO,

37:17.569 --> 37:20.706
JUST TELL ME
YOU'RE READY,

37:20.739 --> 37:23.709
AND, YOU KNOW...

37:23.742 --> 37:25.577
SORRY.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.557
WELL DONE.

37:39.891 --> 37:42.027
HE'S NOT
ALWAYS A JERK.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.497
AND NEITHER
ARE YOU.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.799
SHE OBVIOUSLY
LIKES YOU.

37:47.833 --> 37:51.470
JUST STOP USING HER TOOTHBRUSH
AND STOP PLAYING GAMES.

37:51.503 --> 37:54.940
SHE'LL STILL LIKE YOU.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.444
SHE'S BOSSY...

37:58.477 --> 38:01.380
BUT SHE'S USUALLY RIGHT.

38:14.760 --> 38:15.927
THANK YOU.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.929
DR. HOUSE, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

38:17.963 --> 38:20.832
ARE YOU INSANE
OR JUST STUPID?

38:23.635 --> 38:25.437
IS THERE A THIRD OPTION?

38:25.471 --> 38:27.939
ACTUALLY,
I DON'T THINK THERE IS.

38:31.977 --> 38:35.447
I'M SORRY.
I-I JUST WASN'T THINKING.

38:35.481 --> 38:38.550
I MEAN, I WAS,
BUT ONLY ABOUT MYSELF,

38:38.584 --> 38:41.052
WHICH IS APPARENTLY
THE WAY I AM...

38:41.086 --> 38:45.090
USUALLY, NOT ALWAYS.

38:45.123 --> 38:47.726
AND I NEED TO CONVINCE
SOMEONE OF THAT.

38:47.759 --> 38:48.727
MM-HMM.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.862
AND YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT
BY GETTING SOMEONE

38:50.896 --> 38:55.567
TO PULL STRINGS TO GET
HER DAUGHTER INTO OUR PRESCHOOL.

38:55.601 --> 38:58.437
I SPOKE
TO SANFORD WELLS.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.575
YOU CAN CALL THE POLICE.

39:03.609 --> 39:06.445
YOU CAN TURN ME IN
FOR LYING AT THE ACCIDENT.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.947
OH, I'M SURE MR. DRYDEN
HAS ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF THAT.

39:08.980 --> 39:11.817
LET HER DAUGHTER IN.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.953
SHE'S A GREAT KID,
AND DR. CUDDY IS A GREAT MOM.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.022
THEY'LL FIT IN
PERFECTLY HERE.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.759
AND HOW EXACTLY
DOES ADMITTING HER DAUGHTER

39:20.792 --> 39:23.962
PROVE HOW UNSELFISH
YOU ARE?

39:23.995 --> 39:26.498
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE STILL
DOING IT TO HELP YOURSELF,

39:26.532 --> 39:29.668
NOT ANYONE ELSE.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.903
I DON'T KNOW.

39:31.937 --> 39:35.741
I JUST KNOW THAT
I NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

39:35.774 --> 39:39.010
I NEED HER IN MY LIFE.

39:41.480 --> 39:45.116
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO ACTUALLY NEED SOMEONE?

39:48.720 --> 39:51.857
YES.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.493
I DO.

39:54.526 --> 39:58.129
BUT I ALSO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES.

39:58.163 --> 40:02.033
MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU GREW UP.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.611
DR. HOUSE...

40:12.644 --> 40:14.980
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?

40:15.013 --> 40:18.083
CAN I BE EXCUSED?

40:23.221 --> 40:27.859
IT'S JUST FOOD.

40:27.893 --> 40:30.095
SOMETHING SMALL ENOUGH
TO GO DOWN THE WRONG PIPE,

40:30.128 --> 40:32.764
TOO BIG TO GET WASHED OUT
BY THE BRONCHIAL LAVAGE.

40:32.798 --> 40:35.567
WOULDN'T SHOW UP
ON A C.T.

40:35.601 --> 40:37.168
BUT WOULD CAUSE
THE C.O.P.D.

40:37.202 --> 40:40.171
AND WOULDN'T RESPOND
TO STEROIDS OR ANTIBIOTICS.

40:40.205 --> 40:42.073
PREP HIM
FOR EXPLORATORY SURGERY

40:42.107 --> 40:43.542
AND START THE BETTING.

40:43.575 --> 40:44.643
BETTING?

40:44.676 --> 40:48.113
I GOT A HUNDRED BUCKS
SAYS IT'S A PEA.

40:56.622 --> 40:57.956
I'M BUSY.

40:57.989 --> 41:00.091
I KNOW.

41:06.632 --> 41:09.467
I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT I'M SORRY.

41:11.637 --> 41:14.906
SHOULDN'T YOU BE SAYING THAT
TO SANFORD WELLS?

41:14.940 --> 41:17.609
A FIFTH-GRADE
CAREER DAY?

41:17.643 --> 41:21.613
YOU REALLY THOUGHT
YOU COULD PULL THAT OFF?

41:21.647 --> 41:24.182
I FIGURED,
HOW HARD COULD IT BE?

41:27.686 --> 41:29.087
AND I WANTED TO PROVE
TO YOU

41:29.120 --> 41:32.658
THAT I DO CARE
ABOUT YOUR NEEDS

41:32.691 --> 41:35.561
AND RACHEL'S.

41:35.594 --> 41:38.797
I DO.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.068
IS THAT WHY
YOU ALSO STOLE MY COMPUTER?

41:43.101 --> 41:45.170
YES, IT IS.

41:45.203 --> 41:47.005
AND THEN THREW IT
IN THE TRASH?

41:47.038 --> 41:49.641
I DID NOT THROW IT,
I PLACED IT,

41:49.675 --> 41:51.109
KNOWING THAT THE JANITOR
WOULD FIND IT

41:51.142 --> 41:54.580
AND KNOW IT WAS YOURS
AND RETURN IT TO YOU UNHARMED.

41:54.613 --> 41:56.114
I'M A MORON.

41:56.147 --> 41:58.283
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I-I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU,

41:58.316 --> 41:59.951
THAT I DON'T THINK
ABOUT YOU,

41:59.985 --> 42:03.021
THAT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

42:03.054 --> 42:06.057
I WAS WRONG.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

42:06.091 --> 42:07.559
I CAN DO BETTER.

42:07.593 --> 42:10.696
JUST...GIVE ME A CHANCE.

42:14.165 --> 42:16.301
SO WHAT WERE YOU--

42:16.334 --> 42:19.004
AN ASTRONAUT
OR A BULLFIGHTER?

42:22.040 --> 42:23.609
I WAS MYSELF...

42:23.642 --> 42:26.044
FOR THE MOST PART.

42:33.218 --> 42:34.786
I KNOW YOU'RE STILL UPSET,

42:34.820 --> 42:38.323
SO I'M GONNA...

42:38.356 --> 42:43.194
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO--TO DEAL
WITH IT HOWEVER YOU WANT.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.063
HOUSE.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.238
YOU WANT TO COME OVER
FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

42:53.271 --> 42:55.306
I'D LOVE TO.

43:07.218 --> 43:10.221
