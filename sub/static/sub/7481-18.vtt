Please state the
nature of your emergency.

00:58.405 --> 00:59.804
Help me.

00:59.806 --> 01:01.773
I crashed my car.
Someone's after me.

01:01.775 --> 01:03.775
I'm sorry, sir,
you need to slow down.

01:03.777 --> 01:04.976
It's a bad line.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.194
Which emergency service?

01:06.196 --> 01:07.579
Police! Send the police!

01:07.581 --> 01:08.913
I'm sorry, sir,

01:08.915 --> 01:10.165
the line is very bad.
Can you speak up?

01:10.167 --> 01:13.651
Sir? Sir?

01:17.423 --> 01:20.158
Gunner Sergeant Edward T. Tyler,

United States Marine Corps.

02:23.872 --> 02:25.840
Morning all.

02:28.444 --> 02:30.112
There's a box on my desk.

02:30.114 --> 02:33.415
Mind like a steel trap.

02:33.417 --> 02:35.534
- More like a mouse trap.
Mm-hmm.

02:35.536 --> 02:38.170
That looks just like the box
that Kensi got a few weeks ago.

02:38.172 --> 02:39.521
Check the shipping label
address, Deeks.

02:39.523 --> 02:41.456
Wait a minute.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.543
Oh, that is the box that
Kensi got a few weeks ago.

02:44.545 --> 02:46.595
What is it doing on my desk?
What is it doing on my desk?

02:46.597 --> 02:48.046
No, no, no, no...

02:48.048 --> 02:48.882
Morning.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.961
No, this is not
what it looks like.

02:51.352 --> 02:53.101
Looks like a man holding a box.

02:53.103 --> 02:54.186
An innocent man.
I have witnesses.

02:54.188 --> 02:55.220
Listen,
it was addressed to you,

02:55.222 --> 02:56.471
so I was
taking it back to you.

02:56.473 --> 02:58.023
Which obviously
looks like I took it.

02:58.025 --> 02:59.641
But I didn't take it.
It was put there.

02:59.643 --> 03:00.942
Accidentally,
maybe, on purpose.

03:00.944 --> 03:03.261
And now I'm
stuck holding... your box.

03:03.263 --> 03:04.813
Wow.

03:06.666 --> 03:10.101
I'll just put it on your d...
I put it on your desk.

03:10.103 --> 03:11.737
You put it on my desk.

03:11.739 --> 03:13.538
But it's your box.

03:13.540 --> 03:15.457
And now it's yours.

03:15.459 --> 03:16.625
My-my box?

03:16.627 --> 03:18.243
Your box.

03:18.245 --> 03:21.446
So, if you could just take it
off my desk, please.

03:21.448 --> 03:25.300
Just to clarify,
you're giving me your box?

03:25.302 --> 03:27.586
Uh-huh.

03:29.839 --> 03:31.640
Okay.

03:33.076 --> 03:35.394
What's in it?

03:35.396 --> 03:36.678
What's in the box?

03:36.680 --> 03:38.930
Open it and find out.

03:38.932 --> 03:40.932
Listen, is this some sort of,
uh, devilish trick

03:40.934 --> 03:42.100
that's payback for me snooping?

03:42.102 --> 03:43.485
'Cause I didn't do it.

03:43.487 --> 03:45.687
I didn't Google the sender of
said box in question.

03:45.689 --> 03:47.689
It's not a trick, Deeks.

03:47.691 --> 03:49.107
Fine.

03:49.109 --> 03:50.859
I'll just, uh...

03:50.861 --> 03:53.028
just open it then.

03:53.030 --> 03:54.813
Just open the box.

03:54.815 --> 03:56.865
Just going to
open the box.

04:04.123 --> 04:05.323
Nothing to lose here.

04:05.325 --> 04:07.959
Nothing to see,
just box opening.

04:09.179 --> 04:11.329
We got business.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.885
Hello?

04:19.339 --> 04:21.555
Hello!

04:23.142 --> 04:24.893
Later.

04:24.895 --> 04:26.645
I don't have to
play your reindeer games.

04:26.647 --> 04:27.863
Whatever.

04:33.286 --> 04:34.236
She's good.

04:34.238 --> 04:36.788
Oh, she's very good.
Mm-hmm.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.026
A two-whistle case, Mr. Beale?

04:42.028 --> 04:43.378
That's my fault.

04:43.380 --> 04:47.632
We were dealing with a,
uh, delivery of sorts.

04:47.634 --> 04:50.368
Oh, yes, the box.

04:50.370 --> 04:52.554
What?

04:52.556 --> 04:54.038
A man's been
found, shot through

04:54.040 --> 04:55.674
the back of the head,

04:55.676 --> 04:57.092
execution-style.

04:57.094 --> 04:58.727
Mr. Beale.

04:58.729 --> 05:01.930
The shooting took place four
days ago in Griffith Park,

05:01.932 --> 05:04.316
but the body wasn't identified
until yesterday.

05:04.318 --> 05:07.652
An Indonesian national,
Rachmed Santoso.

05:07.654 --> 05:08.770
Mr. Santoso was

05:08.772 --> 05:10.906
a vocal supporter
of radical Islam

05:10.908 --> 05:13.224
and a suspected arms dealer.

05:13.226 --> 05:15.360
Increased chatter amongst
Taliban groups

05:15.362 --> 05:17.946
in Afghanistan
in recent weeks indicates

05:17.948 --> 05:21.283
a terrorist attack against
the United States is imminent.

05:23.837 --> 05:25.253
Yes.

05:25.255 --> 05:26.505
Speaking.

05:27.623 --> 05:29.708
Uh, Santoso dropped off the grid

05:29.710 --> 05:32.577
ten days ago,
after his name was mentioned

05:32.579 --> 05:34.229
in several
cell phone intercepts,

05:34.231 --> 05:36.948
suggesting he had
an involvement in the crime.

05:36.950 --> 05:38.633
- What happened to his shoes?
- They're missing.

05:38.635 --> 05:41.085
It would appear
the killer took them.

05:41.087 --> 05:43.939
People have been killed
for less.

05:43.941 --> 05:47.091
Santoso had $2,000, in cash,
in his jacket pocket,

05:47.093 --> 05:50.028
so LAPD ruled out robbery
as a motive.

05:51.030 --> 05:52.447
A change in plans.

05:52.449 --> 05:55.099
Ballistics report
incoming, Mr. Beale.

05:55.101 --> 05:57.569
Got it.

05:57.571 --> 06:01.122
Santoso's murder
weapon was used two days later

06:01.124 --> 06:03.074
two kill a United States Marine
in Idaho.

06:03.076 --> 06:04.960
Gunnery Sergeant
Edward Tyler.

06:04.962 --> 06:07.295
He was found beside the road,

06:07.297 --> 06:10.465
night before last...

06:10.467 --> 06:11.883
shot in the back
of the head, execution-style.

06:11.885 --> 06:15.253
Two victims,
same weapon,

06:15.255 --> 06:18.173
a thousand miles apart.

06:18.175 --> 06:19.724
Pack your bags, gentlemen,

06:19.726 --> 06:21.092
you're going to Idaho.

06:21.094 --> 06:22.978
Little town of Moscow.

06:22.980 --> 06:25.230
Meeting state or local police?

06:25.232 --> 06:26.648
Neither.

06:26.650 --> 06:29.434
Our red team's
already on the ground.

06:29.436 --> 06:33.104
Their case may have national
security implications.

06:33.106 --> 06:36.691
Ticktock, gentlemen.

06:37.810 --> 06:39.744
Ms. Blye, Mr. Deeks,

06:39.746 --> 06:42.614
find Mr. Santoso's shoes,

06:42.616 --> 06:44.533
if you would.

06:44.535 --> 06:46.701
Mm.

06:57.763 --> 06:59.464
.22 caliber round.

06:59.466 --> 07:01.683
Low noise,
low velocity.

07:01.685 --> 07:03.768
Bullet rattles
around inside the skull.

07:03.770 --> 07:05.336
No exit wound.

07:05.338 --> 07:08.523
The ground is still
soft from the rain.

07:08.525 --> 07:09.891
No clear signs
of a struggle.

07:09.893 --> 07:11.142
Which means the shooter

07:11.144 --> 07:12.176
must've walked up
from behind him.

07:12.178 --> 07:13.478
Well, that's weird,

07:13.480 --> 07:14.646
there's only
one set of shoe prints.

07:14.648 --> 07:16.014
Which means
our shooter can

07:16.016 --> 07:19.568
either levitate
and/or, he's a ghost.

07:19.570 --> 07:21.786
I don't believe in ghosts.
Really?

07:21.788 --> 07:24.188
Hey, uh, how come
we don't have a color?

07:24.190 --> 07:25.540
What do you mean?

07:25.542 --> 07:27.742
Hetty said that the
agents who went to Idaho

07:27.744 --> 07:29.294
were the red team.

07:29.296 --> 07:30.862
How come we're not, like,
the silver team

07:30.864 --> 07:32.530
or the gold team or the
platinum team?

07:32.532 --> 07:36.534
Colors identify each team
that work inside that division.

07:36.536 --> 07:37.586
Oh.

07:37.588 --> 07:40.255
Blue team,
green team, red team.

07:40.257 --> 07:43.558
They operate out of Georgia,
but they're never home.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.094
They work,
travel, sleep together.

07:46.096 --> 07:47.145
It's basically
like living on a submarine.

07:47.147 --> 07:48.713
Wait, what?

07:48.715 --> 07:50.148
Stop the press,
did you say sleep together?

07:50.150 --> 07:51.983
Down, Rover.

07:51.985 --> 07:53.217
Separate bunks.

07:53.219 --> 07:54.402
Yeah.

07:54.404 --> 07:55.553
They deploy everywhere.

07:55.555 --> 07:57.072
Even overseas.

07:57.074 --> 07:59.274
How does one get on
one of these teams?

07:59.276 --> 08:02.160
You become an NCIS agent,

08:02.162 --> 08:03.361
Detective.

08:03.363 --> 08:05.063
Oh, right, yeah.

08:06.333 --> 08:08.399
What do you got?

08:08.401 --> 08:10.068
I also
don't believe

08:10.070 --> 08:11.736
in levitation.

08:11.738 --> 08:13.872
Those are very neatly placed.

08:13.874 --> 08:17.008
So, were are looking
for a shooter with OCD?

08:19.745 --> 08:21.930
Creeps up behind Santoso,

08:21.932 --> 08:23.848
pops him,

08:23.850 --> 08:25.433
slips on his shoes,

08:25.435 --> 08:28.053
walks all the
way back down the road,

08:28.055 --> 08:33.107
stepping in his own footsteps,
eliminating them.

08:33.110 --> 08:35.143
So the shooter's not
a ghost, he's just clever.

08:36.897 --> 08:38.697
Very clever.

09:01.303 --> 09:03.054
Thanks, guys.

09:03.056 --> 09:04.673
Welcome to
Moscow, Idaho.

09:04.675 --> 09:07.308
Danny Gallagher, Logistics Officer.
Agent Callen.

09:07.310 --> 09:08.593
Sam Hanna.

09:08.595 --> 09:09.928
You guys ever
been to Moscow before?

09:09.930 --> 09:11.479
Not <i>this</i> Moscow.

09:11.481 --> 09:13.264
Locals say this one's
even colder.

09:13.266 --> 09:14.983
At least no one'll
be trying to kill me here.

09:15.986 --> 09:16.985
When did your team arrive?

09:16.987 --> 09:18.603
Uh, yesterday.

09:18.605 --> 09:21.239
We got three agents, two tech
supports, including myself,

09:21.241 --> 09:23.491
and our team leader,
Agent Paris Summerskill.

09:23.493 --> 09:25.977
I've heard of her;
never met her.

09:25.979 --> 09:29.480
Well, right now,
Paris is kind of "outranked."

09:29.482 --> 09:30.648
Outranked?
Yeah.

09:30.650 --> 09:32.784
By who?

09:32.786 --> 09:35.704
That would be me,
Agent Callen.

09:35.706 --> 09:37.322
Now get your gear in

09:37.324 --> 09:40.491
before we all
freeze our asses off.

10:00.984 --> 10:02.935
<i>We flew the trucks</i>
<i>in yesterday from Florida.</i>

10:02.937 --> 10:04.970
<i>You never know where you're</i>
<i>going to end up next</i>

10:04.972 --> 10:06.155
<i>with this job.</i>

10:10.193 --> 10:13.078
I was in San Francisco
when Hetty briefed me.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.813
Given the heightened
security level,

10:14.815 --> 10:16.782
I thought
I'd make the detour.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.418
First time I've seen it.

10:19.420 --> 10:22.154
It's our
home away from home.

10:22.156 --> 10:23.672
Trust me,
you're going to love it.

10:32.716 --> 10:35.667
We're back!

10:35.669 --> 10:37.803
Whoo!

10:39.856 --> 10:41.724
Hi, guys.
Hey.

10:41.726 --> 10:45.611
This is it.

10:45.613 --> 10:47.396
State of the art.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.366
State of the art, my ass.

10:52.018 --> 10:55.037
Can you hold this?
Damn snow melt.

10:55.039 --> 10:57.206
How come those geniuses down in
Washington didn't think

10:57.208 --> 10:59.875
about snow accumulating
on a flat roof?

10:59.877 --> 11:02.161
I told 'em about
this last year.

11:02.163 --> 11:03.128
They never listen.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.197
And I went to Caltech
for this.

11:05.199 --> 11:08.501
Tell someone who cares, Kai.
Do you care, Owen?

11:08.503 --> 11:11.170
Not unless I have to write
a memo about it.

11:11.172 --> 11:12.972
Thank you, sir.

11:12.974 --> 11:15.975
Sam, Callen, meet our boss,
Paris Summerskill.

11:17.727 --> 11:20.429
Callen... heard
a lot about you.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.983
You, too, Sam.

11:23.985 --> 11:25.717
Hope it's good.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.553
Mostly.

11:27.555 --> 11:30.439
Special Agent Claire Keats.

11:30.441 --> 11:32.441
Hey. Either of you smoke?

11:32.443 --> 11:33.642
No.

11:33.644 --> 11:35.160
Damn.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.529
Over there, that's Dave Flynn,

11:36.531 --> 11:38.664
our forensic specialist
and tonight's cook.

11:38.666 --> 11:40.032
No vegetarians?

11:40.034 --> 11:42.284
No.
That's a relief.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.453
Wait, wait.
No vegans either, right?

11:44.455 --> 11:46.672
No.

11:46.674 --> 11:50.459
Great. I'll just do the
croutons, and supper is up.

11:50.461 --> 11:52.911
We'll get an early start
in the morning,

11:52.913 --> 11:54.580
assuming this storm
blows itself out.

11:54.582 --> 11:56.932
Walk the crime scene.
In the meantime, drop your gear,

11:56.934 --> 11:59.351
make yourself at home.
The head's back that way.

11:59.353 --> 12:01.770
Oh, Danny, the head's
backed up again.

12:01.772 --> 12:03.389
Oh, man.

12:03.391 --> 12:06.308
You guys might want
to take a bucket.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.431
Welcome to red team.

12:12.433 --> 12:14.533
Tyler was in Moscow
on a five-day leave

12:14.535 --> 12:15.784
visiting his sister.

12:15.786 --> 12:17.987
You've spoken
with her?

12:17.989 --> 12:20.623
Mm. She's pretty cut up.
Eddie was her only brother.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.124
I'll have some bread.
Thanks.

12:22.126 --> 12:24.627
Did Sergeant Tyler have
security clearance?

12:24.629 --> 12:26.378
Low level. Worked in transport.

12:28.749 --> 12:32.384
He made a call from a roadside
emergency phone.

12:32.386 --> 12:34.003
Said he'd
crashed his car.

12:34.005 --> 12:35.554
Someone was
chasing him.

12:35.556 --> 12:37.389
Emergency services found him
about ten minutes later.

12:37.391 --> 12:38.723
Low-caliber round
to the back of the head,

12:38.748 --> 12:40.260
like he was executed.

12:40.261 --> 12:41.477
Motive?

12:41.479 --> 12:42.794
Definitely
wasn't robbery.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.813
His wallet, his cash
and his credit cards

12:44.815 --> 12:46.465
were found next to his body.

12:46.467 --> 12:48.400
Not the way Marines normally
end up getting murdered,

12:48.402 --> 12:49.902
if there is a "normal."

12:49.904 --> 12:51.970
The ballistics report
linking him to Santoso's murder

12:51.972 --> 12:53.822
puts it in
a whole different light.

12:53.824 --> 12:55.824
Incoming!

12:58.161 --> 13:00.312
24/7.
We're always open.

13:02.082 --> 13:05.417
Sorry to crash your supper,
Miss Summerskill.

13:05.419 --> 13:06.985
Evening, Henrietta.

13:06.987 --> 13:10.456
Owen.
Mr. Callen, Mr. Hanna.

13:10.458 --> 13:12.007
Hetty.
Hetty.

13:12.009 --> 13:13.842
Just calling to brief you

13:13.844 --> 13:16.378
on the latest with the Santoso
investigation. Eric?

13:16.380 --> 13:20.165
Uh, right. Uh, the briefing.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.517
Uh, well, Kensi and Deeks--

13:21.519 --> 13:26.388
um, uh, Agent Blye
and Detective Deeks,

13:26.390 --> 13:27.940
they went to the crime scene

13:27.942 --> 13:32.978
and they found
Santoso's missing shoes.

13:32.980 --> 13:38.701
And, uh, Nell and I,
uh, we have been...

13:38.703 --> 13:41.687
We are in the process
of checking

13:41.689 --> 13:44.123
Santoso's missing phone records,
but nothing to report.

13:44.125 --> 13:46.392
Yet. Nothing yet.
Right.

13:46.394 --> 13:48.661
Thank you, Eric.

13:48.663 --> 13:55.551
So, how is everyone getting on
in Idaho?

13:55.553 --> 13:58.203
Everything's fine, Henrietta.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.705
Mr. Callen?

13:59.707 --> 14:01.140
All good.

14:01.142 --> 14:02.725
Miss Summerskill?

14:02.727 --> 14:05.894
Um, it's great to have company
for dinner.

14:05.896 --> 14:08.347
Dave makes
a mean chicken soup.

14:08.349 --> 14:10.215
Fish.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.650
It... It was, it was fish.

14:11.652 --> 14:12.768
That was fish?

14:12.770 --> 14:13.769
Excellent.

14:13.771 --> 14:15.654
We regroup tomorrow.

14:15.656 --> 14:20.909
Go to bed. Stay warm.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.664
Shut it down, Eric.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.453
What was that
all about?

14:31.455 --> 14:33.706
Something.

14:33.708 --> 14:35.708
Something
she's not telling us.

14:35.710 --> 14:38.460
Something she may never tell us.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.083
Cozy.

14:47.470 --> 14:48.470
Whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:48.472 --> 14:51.140
Why do you get the bottom bunk?

14:51.142 --> 14:52.357
Got here first.

14:54.277 --> 14:56.311
G, the last time
I slept on the top bunk,

14:56.313 --> 14:58.280
I rolled over in the morning

14:58.282 --> 15:00.149
and landed on a petty officer
tying his shoelaces.

15:00.151 --> 15:02.484
Broke his arm in three places.

15:06.105 --> 15:09.274
Okay, now that's
what I'm talking about.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.160
Hetty's checking up
on us.

15:11.162 --> 15:12.411
Yep.

15:12.413 --> 15:14.213
Take a stab
at guessing why?

15:15.616 --> 15:18.884
Maybe she wanted to see
if you and Paris

15:18.886 --> 15:20.219
hit it off.

15:20.221 --> 15:23.388
She's a good-looking
woman, G.

15:26.226 --> 15:30.729
You snore, I'm gonna shoot you.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.435
So what's the connection between
Eddie Tyler--

15:36.437 --> 15:39.488
a Marine with an impeccable
military record--

15:39.490 --> 15:41.306
and a zealot like Santoso?

15:41.308 --> 15:44.860
Both shot in the back of the
head with a low-velocity round.

15:44.862 --> 15:47.813
All the hallmarks
of a professional hit.

15:47.815 --> 15:50.616
A professional would never use
the same weapon twice.

15:50.618 --> 15:53.669
The shooter's getting arrogant.

15:53.671 --> 15:57.022
He doesn't believe
he's ever gonna get caught.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.336
Cozy.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.194
Yeah, cozy.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.543
Eric?

16:38.581 --> 16:40.031
Eric?

16:40.033 --> 16:41.466
Yeah, just leaving.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.905
You didn't go home
last night?

16:46.907 --> 16:50.492
I didn't. I...
Is it morning?

16:50.494 --> 16:52.227
0500.

16:52.229 --> 16:53.712
Oh, my gosh...

16:53.714 --> 16:56.014
What exactly were you doing
all night?

16:56.016 --> 16:57.449
Sleeping upright
in this chair.

16:57.451 --> 17:01.570
Right. But before that?
What is this?

17:01.572 --> 17:05.207
I was getting a lead on Santoso.

17:05.209 --> 17:07.159
On his car.

17:07.161 --> 17:08.443
Nell, I found his car.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.060
Great.

17:10.063 --> 17:13.531
Okay. Hetty's unexpected
briefing freaked me out

17:13.534 --> 17:14.833
because we didn't have
anything.

17:14.835 --> 17:16.919
I mean, we had nothing.
That was, like, a non-briefing.

17:16.921 --> 17:18.921
I don't know what she was
expecting to hear,

17:18.923 --> 17:20.571
but I know
she didn't hear it.

17:20.574 --> 17:21.540
Yeah, yeah,
it was weird.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.959
Yeah. So...
 I stayed

17:23.961 --> 17:25.928
and I trawled cameras in
the neighborhood

17:25.930 --> 17:27.963
where Santoso was shot.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.598
Found this.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.218
He parked the car
in a lot

17:33.220 --> 17:35.854
a quarter mile from the road
where his body was found.

17:35.856 --> 17:38.523
It's still there.
And...

17:39.442 --> 17:40.976
it was a rental.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.996
Santoso was using a fake name
and driver's license.

17:43.998 --> 17:46.064
But he slipped up.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.233
He used a real address.

17:50.620 --> 17:52.070
It's West Hollywood.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.822
Cheap, short-term
vacation rentals.

17:53.824 --> 17:55.457
I called them.

17:55.459 --> 17:57.442
He's been staying there
the past couple weeks.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.595
That's about the same time
s na hi was linked

17:59.597 --> 18:00.896
to the planned attacks.

18:00.898 --> 18:02.531
Kensi or Deeks?

18:02.533 --> 18:03.832
Both.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.968
Federal agents!

18:13.960 --> 18:16.678
Clear?
Clear.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.897
Well, either Santoso
really likes pizza

18:18.899 --> 18:20.799
or he had company
for dinner.

18:20.801 --> 18:23.085
I think it was more
than a dinner party.

18:23.087 --> 18:25.570
There are three extra sleeping
bags in this room.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.572
At least four of them
holed up in here.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.491
All right, so how many
terrorists does it take

18:29.493 --> 18:30.709
to make a cell?

18:32.913 --> 18:34.413
Hey, Kens.
What do you got?

18:34.415 --> 18:38.083
Hey, Eric, we're gonna need any
security and traffic cam footage

18:38.085 --> 18:40.669
you can find on Santoso's
apartment for the past week.

18:40.671 --> 18:42.204
Santoso had company.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.989
On it.

18:43.991 --> 18:45.507
Bad company.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.544
Nine-millimeter ammo.
Military grade.

18:49.546 --> 18:52.681
Enough for someone
to start a war.

19:08.266 --> 19:10.151
...break out those snow shovels.

19:10.153 --> 19:12.887
And we might not have seen
the last of it.

19:12.889 --> 19:15.156
The National Weather Service
is continuing

19:15.158 --> 19:17.358
the winter storm watch
for Moscow, Potlach...

19:17.360 --> 19:18.325
Morning.

19:18.327 --> 19:20.277
Hey.
Hey.

19:21.963 --> 19:24.165
Which fridge?
I'm sorry?

19:24.167 --> 19:28.836
Um, the butter.

19:28.838 --> 19:31.172
The lower fridge.

19:31.174 --> 19:34.425
Mm. That might not be butter.

19:35.260 --> 19:37.044
What might that be?

19:37.046 --> 19:40.097
Evidence or a sample...

19:40.099 --> 19:42.299
or maybe something
Dave's growing.

19:42.301 --> 19:44.602
Our kitchen doubles as a lab
when we're out in the field.

19:44.604 --> 19:47.438
Dave's usually
pretty good at labeling things.

19:48.723 --> 19:50.007
I'm sorry. Here.

19:50.009 --> 19:51.392
Thank you.
Yeah.

19:51.394 --> 19:54.361
Damn!

19:54.363 --> 19:56.564
Sounds like Sam
just woke up.

20:00.619 --> 20:02.203
They got an early start.

20:02.205 --> 20:03.788
Yeah. He told Claire
that he wanted

20:03.790 --> 20:05.689
to review the evidence
that we've collected so far.

20:05.691 --> 20:08.242
Busy crime scene?
Hardly. It was snowing.

20:08.244 --> 20:10.661
There wasn't
much left to find.

20:10.663 --> 20:14.048
There was no tire tracks,
no footprints.

20:14.050 --> 20:16.217
There's no
physical evidence.

20:19.054 --> 20:21.038
The crime scene
was processed

20:21.040 --> 20:22.706
by the local sheriff's
department.

20:22.708 --> 20:25.543
It looks like the shooter
emptied Tyler's pockets.

20:25.545 --> 20:27.544
He was very neat,
methodical.

20:27.546 --> 20:30.380
The only thing that's obvious
that's missing is...

20:30.382 --> 20:31.899
...his cell phone.

20:33.902 --> 20:35.886
Which he used to call
his sister

20:35.888 --> 20:37.404
ten minutes
before he was killed.

20:37.406 --> 20:38.772
You said last night

20:38.774 --> 20:40.658
that he called for help
from a roadside phone.

20:40.660 --> 20:42.493
Right. So why didn't
he use his own phone?

20:42.495 --> 20:44.495
Maybe he left it in the car.
We checked.

20:44.497 --> 20:47.531
So he's driving

20:47.533 --> 20:48.899
to his sister's.

20:48.901 --> 20:51.568
<i>Suddenly, he realizes</i>
<i>that someone's</i>

20:51.570 --> 20:52.586
following him.

20:52.588 --> 20:54.255
So he tries
to gets away.

20:54.257 --> 20:56.790
He loses control
on the icy road.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.294
Drags himself out.

21:00.296 --> 21:01.462
<i>Maybe keeps running</i>

21:01.464 --> 21:02.596
<i>'cause he's still being chased.</i>

21:02.598 --> 21:05.716
He pulls out his own phone
to call for help.

21:07.103 --> 21:09.303
It's cold, he's shaken up,

21:09.305 --> 21:11.889
he's scared. He drops it.

21:11.891 --> 21:15.559
We're gonna need
a metal detector.

21:18.314 --> 21:19.813
He's got an agenda.

21:19.815 --> 21:22.700
Granger always
has an agenda.

21:22.702 --> 21:25.369
Maybe he knew the victim.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.121
Or he knew the killer.

21:27.123 --> 21:29.156
Well, he'd tell us.
Wouldn't he?

21:29.158 --> 21:31.242
Absolutely.

21:31.244 --> 21:33.127
You don't like him.

21:35.797 --> 21:37.598
We have trust issues.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.334
Mm.

21:42.003 --> 21:45.622
It's an unusual name.

21:45.624 --> 21:47.558
"Paris."

21:47.560 --> 21:50.177
This coming from a guy
whose name is a letter

21:50.179 --> 21:51.595
in the alphabet...

21:51.597 --> 21:54.064
I could call you by your initial.
No, thanks.

21:54.066 --> 21:56.066
It actually has
a certain ring to it.

21:56.068 --> 21:57.818
No, that's okay.
More of a tinkle.

21:57.820 --> 21:59.320
Okay.
Huh?

21:59.322 --> 22:02.656
I was um...

22:02.658 --> 22:04.692
I was born in Paris.

22:06.361 --> 22:08.762
My mother was a dancer.

22:08.764 --> 22:12.333
Yes, and my dad played cello
for their band.

22:13.484 --> 22:14.802
Huh.

22:14.804 --> 22:18.322
I know, I come
from a creative family

22:18.324 --> 22:20.624
and I ended up a cop--
go figure.

22:22.510 --> 22:24.962
Paris is a beautiful city.

22:24.964 --> 22:28.849
Yeah... very romantic.

22:32.170 --> 22:33.837
It snow much yesterday?

22:33.839 --> 22:36.390
Oh, it was heavy.
Eased off in the afternoon.

22:37.442 --> 22:39.026
Someone's been
here since then.

22:39.028 --> 22:41.395
No one from my team.

22:41.397 --> 22:43.397
Well, whoever it was...

22:43.399 --> 22:45.699
they spent some time here.

22:45.701 --> 22:48.235
Lot of tracks between
where Tyler crashed

22:48.237 --> 22:50.154
and where he was shot.

22:50.156 --> 22:51.655
They were looking
for something.

22:51.657 --> 22:53.991
Maybe the same thing
we're looking for.

22:57.579 --> 22:59.463
Santoso was staying
in the apartment

22:59.465 --> 23:01.531
with at least five
other people.

23:01.533 --> 23:03.634
Evidence suggests they
geared up for a fight.

23:03.636 --> 23:05.419
Hey, guys.

23:10.141 --> 23:11.925
Here we go.

23:21.653 --> 23:23.187
48 hours in the snow.

23:23.189 --> 23:25.689
Looks like we're gonna need
a new battery.

23:30.395 --> 23:32.663
We did a preliminary check
on his phone log.

23:32.665 --> 23:34.231
Mostly work-related calls,

23:34.233 --> 23:36.784
a few family calls, but
nothing out of the ordinary.

23:36.786 --> 23:39.336
Shooter spent valuable getaway
time searching the body.

23:39.338 --> 23:41.238
Yeah, and possibly came back
for a second look

23:41.240 --> 23:42.790
once the crime scene
was cleared.

23:42.792 --> 23:44.425
Has to be the phone.

23:44.427 --> 23:46.628
Well, if there's something
there, our guys will find it.

23:50.682 --> 23:53.667
<i>Danny, pull over. Let him pass.</i>

23:53.669 --> 23:55.185
Pull off! Pull off!

24:01.592 --> 24:02.943
Stay back.

24:10.101 --> 24:12.286
Go, go, go!

24:28.837 --> 24:29.398
Where'd he go?

24:33.476 --> 24:34.725
Danny?

24:34.727 --> 24:36.510
You stay with her, I got him.

24:36.512 --> 24:38.095
Danny!

24:40.298 --> 24:42.850
Here, I got you.
Lean you back.

24:42.852 --> 24:44.468
I got you.
You're gonna be all right.

24:45.471 --> 24:48.605
Kai, we got a man down.

24:48.607 --> 24:51.825
Need an ambulance
to our GPS location now.

25:02.623 --> 25:04.383
I lost his tracks
in amongst the rocks.

25:04.384 --> 25:05.934
He must've had a
car somewhere.

25:05.936 --> 25:08.553
What about the real
snow plow driver?

25:08.555 --> 25:10.338
Uh, dumped in a ditch
by the roadside.

25:10.340 --> 25:13.108
Shot in the head, low caliber
round, same as the others.

25:14.810 --> 25:16.111
Tell me we got something, Dave.

25:16.113 --> 25:17.479
Let's take a look.

25:17.481 --> 25:19.230
How's Danny?

25:19.232 --> 25:20.848
He's in surgery.

25:20.850 --> 25:23.851
Ruptured spleen, other internal
injuries from the impact.

25:23.853 --> 25:24.852
They're gonna call us.

25:24.854 --> 25:26.871
Put it up.

25:26.873 --> 25:28.990
All right, you should
be getting a feed, Eric.

25:28.992 --> 25:30.875
Got it.

25:30.877 --> 25:33.078
Okay...
half a dozen photos,

25:33.080 --> 25:34.512
no saved voicemails,

25:34.514 --> 25:36.681
a string of text
messages to "Karen."

25:36.683 --> 25:37.799
His sister.

25:37.801 --> 25:38.917
And a couple other guys.

25:38.919 --> 25:40.635
Check the camera roll.

25:44.306 --> 25:47.275
Looks like he was
having some fun.

25:47.277 --> 25:48.927
Any recent videos?

25:48.929 --> 25:51.146
Uh, yeah.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.218
Man, this is worse
than Thanksgiving.

25:57.220 --> 25:58.436
Look at all these poor people.

25:58.438 --> 25:59.487
Look at the date.

25:59.489 --> 26:01.272
Yeah-- same day he was shot.

26:01.274 --> 26:02.524
What airport is that?

26:02.526 --> 26:03.575
O'Hare.

26:03.577 --> 26:06.194
Yeah, he had
a layover in Chicago.

26:06.196 --> 26:08.780
Ooh, she's cute.

26:09.832 --> 26:12.367
Sorry, ma'am, I got a girl.

26:12.369 --> 26:14.502
I love you, Sara, baby.

26:15.904 --> 26:17.122
That's it?

26:17.124 --> 26:18.840
That's it.

26:18.842 --> 26:21.459
Play it again.

26:22.344 --> 26:23.962
Towards the end.

26:23.964 --> 26:26.414
What are we looking for, Claire?

26:26.416 --> 26:27.748
She looks up,

26:27.750 --> 26:30.101
steps back...
there, the guy.

26:30.103 --> 26:31.519
Behind her.

26:31.521 --> 26:32.920
He covers his face.

26:32.922 --> 26:34.772
Back it up a couple
frames, Kai?

26:34.774 --> 26:36.558
Here you go.

26:38.477 --> 26:40.695
He filmed somebody who didn't
want to be filmed.

26:40.697 --> 26:42.397
Kai, facial
recognition.

26:42.399 --> 26:44.866
We need a name.
You got it.

26:44.868 --> 26:46.100
Tyler was killed because he shot

26:46.102 --> 26:47.535
some innocent phone-cam video

26:47.537 --> 26:49.204
in an airport terminal?

26:49.206 --> 26:50.455
That sucks.

26:50.457 --> 26:52.991
Tyler was wearing
a Marine uniform.

26:52.993 --> 26:55.660
If you're a terrorist,
that might be reason enough.

26:55.662 --> 26:57.495
He's not from
the Middle East.

26:57.497 --> 26:59.414
Fair skin, fair hair.

26:59.416 --> 27:01.382
The kind of terrorist
we should fear the most.

27:01.384 --> 27:02.750
One of us.

27:02.752 --> 27:05.837
Get his photo out
to all major airports.

27:05.839 --> 27:07.722
Find him.

27:07.724 --> 27:09.507
Thank you,
Ms. Summerskill.

27:09.509 --> 27:10.791
Owen.

27:10.793 --> 27:12.177
Hetty.

27:12.179 --> 27:14.762
Eric.

27:14.764 --> 27:17.065
Anything more

27:17.067 --> 27:18.816
on Santoso's apartment?

27:18.818 --> 27:21.719
Kensi and Deeks
are still working on it.

27:25.658 --> 27:27.325
You can always
open it.

27:27.327 --> 27:29.744
Or you could just tell me
what's inside of it

27:29.746 --> 27:32.030
and why you gave it to me.

27:34.116 --> 27:35.867
We need to find out
who came and went

27:35.869 --> 27:37.335
from Santoso's apartment.

27:37.337 --> 27:39.837
No security cameras,
no ATMs nearby.

27:39.839 --> 27:41.506
What's this building here?

27:41.508 --> 27:43.875
Listed as a
private business.

27:43.877 --> 27:46.594
Property owner is
Amber Starr.

27:46.596 --> 27:48.496
Wait, what? <i>The</i> Amber Starr?

27:48.498 --> 27:50.632
I doubt there's two.
Do you know her?

27:50.634 --> 27:52.800
Yeah, she runs a string
of massage parlors.

27:52.802 --> 27:54.185
Security conscious?
Are you kidding me?

27:54.187 --> 27:55.270
She's probably got
more cameras

27:55.272 --> 27:56.504
than the Pentagon,
inside and out.

27:56.506 --> 27:57.438
But she's not just gonna

27:57.440 --> 27:59.974
hand over her hard drive
to anyone.

27:59.976 --> 28:02.443
But she does owe me a favor.

28:03.897 --> 28:04.779
Stop.

28:04.781 --> 28:06.698
Go back.

28:08.934 --> 28:11.152
24 hours ago.

28:11.154 --> 28:13.371
Four guys plus
the driver.

28:13.373 --> 28:15.657
No prizes for guessing

28:15.659 --> 28:18.159
what's inside those duffel bags.

28:18.161 --> 28:21.129
Eric, hold it there, please.

28:30.923 --> 28:33.174
Bugger.

28:33.176 --> 28:34.759
Got a name on
the airport guy.

28:34.761 --> 28:36.811
TSA security footage
out of Los Angeles.

28:36.813 --> 28:38.179
Facial recognition scan.

28:38.181 --> 28:39.797
It's, uh, probably
a fake I.D.,

28:39.799 --> 28:41.816
but a Robert Spears
flew into LAX

28:41.818 --> 28:43.384
at 6:00 a.m. this morning.

28:43.386 --> 28:44.485
All right.

28:44.487 --> 28:45.987
I'm gonna send Callen

28:45.989 --> 28:47.355
and Sam back to Los Angeles.

28:47.357 --> 28:49.324
You can wrap up
your investigation here.

28:49.326 --> 28:50.408
Okay.
Incoming.

28:50.410 --> 28:52.226
Harris,

28:52.228 --> 28:53.728
Owen,

28:53.730 --> 28:56.030
we've had a disturbing
development.

28:56.032 --> 28:59.233
Earlier today,
a man named Ari Sayed

28:59.235 --> 29:02.537
and four others were recorded

29:02.539 --> 29:04.505
leaving Santoso's apartment.

29:04.507 --> 29:07.842
They're all Afghani military,
and disappeared

29:07.844 --> 29:12.413
from a DoD training course
last month, in Texas.

29:12.415 --> 29:14.081
What sort of training?

29:14.083 --> 29:16.301
Advanced aeronautics.

29:19.054 --> 29:21.139
They're all qualified pilots.

29:45.948 --> 29:48.833
Spears rented a car
when he flew into L.A.

29:48.835 --> 29:51.002
Same credit card
was used to rent the van

29:51.004 --> 29:52.620
that picked up the men
at Santoso's apartment.

29:52.622 --> 29:54.422
Spears upgraded;
got himself a car with GPS.

29:54.424 --> 29:55.456
Where is it now?

29:55.458 --> 29:56.674
About two blocks away.

29:56.676 --> 29:58.976
Burbank police found it
in the driveway

29:58.978 --> 30:01.763
of a house owned
by a TSA officer.

30:01.765 --> 30:02.947
They found his body
in the garage,

30:02.949 --> 30:04.232
dead less than an hour.

30:04.234 --> 30:05.516
His security pass

30:05.518 --> 30:06.651
was missing.

30:06.653 --> 30:08.102
They also found spray paint can

30:08.104 --> 30:11.072
and a stencil
with the letters T-S-A.

30:11.074 --> 30:12.973
Well, Spears is
the head of the snake.

30:12.975 --> 30:16.327
He took out Santoso, who
supplied weapons to his cell.

30:16.329 --> 30:17.912
So either he didn't trust him
or doesn't need him anymore.

30:17.914 --> 30:20.114
He took out Sergeant Tyler
on the off chance someone

30:20.116 --> 30:21.082
recognized him.

30:21.084 --> 30:22.083
Spears is a Westerner.

30:22.085 --> 30:23.084
Which do you think?

30:23.086 --> 30:24.369
Money or ideology?

30:24.371 --> 30:26.654
Money, I hope.

30:28.374 --> 30:30.658
Both vehicles-- load 'em up.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.043
Eric, alert Burbank authorities

30:32.045 --> 30:33.961
to lock down all vehicle access
to the airport.

30:33.963 --> 30:36.714
And we need to know which gate
TSA personnel use to drive on.

30:36.716 --> 30:37.932
Stand by.

30:39.685 --> 30:42.136
Callen, end of the street,
Gate B.

30:42.138 --> 30:43.104
Got it.

30:43.106 --> 30:45.773
Sam. The white van.

30:45.775 --> 30:47.442
Hang on, Kensi. Stay close.

30:47.444 --> 30:49.377
Roger that.

30:49.379 --> 30:51.145
I.D.

32:02.768 --> 32:03.751
Move it! Move it!

32:03.753 --> 32:05.770
Paris, with me. On Spears.

32:23.205 --> 32:24.989
Turn over!

32:24.991 --> 32:26.040
Over!

32:26.042 --> 32:29.944
Four dead, one slightly wounded.

32:29.946 --> 32:31.295
Spears?

32:32.332 --> 32:33.631
He got away.

32:49.209 --> 32:50.710
What's in the box?

32:50.712 --> 32:53.362
Wow, that is
a fantastic question,

32:53.364 --> 32:54.547
Why don't you ask my partner,

32:54.549 --> 32:55.648
not that she's gonna tell you.

32:55.650 --> 32:57.717
I forgot his birthday.

32:57.719 --> 33:00.119
I felt bad,
so I decided to get him

33:00.121 --> 33:02.155
something that he's
always wanted

33:02.157 --> 33:04.524
more than anything else
in the world.

33:04.526 --> 33:06.692
Cool.

33:06.694 --> 33:08.895
Claire gave me socks
for my birthday.

33:08.897 --> 33:10.446
They gave me a rash.

33:10.448 --> 33:12.782
You already had the rash, Dave.

33:12.784 --> 33:14.567
But it got worse.

33:14.569 --> 33:16.068
They're warm socks, though.

33:16.904 --> 33:19.071
You really did that?

33:20.290 --> 33:22.291
Open it, find out.

33:25.696 --> 33:27.363
And what if you got it wrong?

33:27.365 --> 33:29.749
I mean, 'cause

33:29.751 --> 33:32.084
life doesn't get any better
than this moment right now

33:32.086 --> 33:33.636
'cause everything
I ever wanted is inside...

33:34.589 --> 33:36.305
...this box, right?

33:40.060 --> 33:42.478
There's no real reason
to open it, then, is there?

33:42.480 --> 33:44.430
Nope.

33:44.432 --> 33:46.149
There isn't.

33:46.151 --> 33:48.267
It's not socks, is it?

33:50.720 --> 33:52.655
I'm just gonna put this up here.

33:53.658 --> 33:55.224
Danny?

33:55.226 --> 33:57.243
Yeah, yeah, they're taking him
off the critical list.

33:57.245 --> 33:58.561
That's good news.

33:58.563 --> 34:01.330
Yeah.

34:02.249 --> 34:04.083
Well, you're
a man down.

34:04.085 --> 34:06.169
A couple months,
that's all.

34:06.171 --> 34:08.371
I better tell
the team.

34:10.674 --> 34:13.092
Eric and Nell are checking
cell phone calls with the NSA.

34:13.094 --> 34:15.511
We might have leads on
Spears within the hour.

34:15.513 --> 34:19.181
I want this guy.

34:19.184 --> 34:20.850
You're not the only one.

34:25.304 --> 34:29.525
You weren't
in San Francisco, Owen.

34:29.527 --> 34:32.445
You were in New York,

34:32.447 --> 34:34.597
on your way to Washington.

34:37.601 --> 34:40.652
You've seen his work before.

34:43.824 --> 34:48.610
Our shooter's got a name now,
or at least a face.

34:49.478 --> 34:52.797
Long story, is it?

34:55.619 --> 34:58.054
Red team's a man down.

35:12.486 --> 35:15.104
You really want me
to approve this?

35:15.106 --> 35:18.574
It's about time they put
the past behind them.

35:18.576 --> 35:21.577
As long as you don't
expect me to tell her.

35:21.579 --> 35:23.412
No.

35:23.414 --> 35:26.249
My decision, my job.

35:30.954 --> 35:34.590
Oh, bugger, he's early.

35:37.544 --> 35:39.629
I loved him for that.

35:39.631 --> 35:41.514
It was such a crazy thing to do.

35:54.278 --> 35:56.279
Roy.

35:56.281 --> 35:59.148
Sorry to hear
about Danny.

35:59.150 --> 36:01.450
Yeah, he's going
to be all right.

36:01.452 --> 36:03.669
Good.

36:03.671 --> 36:06.422
Evening, Roy.

36:06.424 --> 36:07.373
Hetty, sir.

36:07.375 --> 36:09.575
Roy.
You're early.

36:11.361 --> 36:14.130
Uh, Roy is going

36:14.132 --> 36:17.750
to be filling in
until Danny's fit for duty.

36:21.871 --> 36:23.923
You good with that?

36:36.903 --> 36:38.654
Whew.

36:38.656 --> 36:40.740
I didn't see that.

36:43.777 --> 36:47.496
Well, that wasn't
so bad, was it, Roy?

37:07.885 --> 37:09.418
Roy!

37:10.920 --> 37:12.972
It's okay... okay.

37:14.692 --> 37:16.475
Where were you?

37:34.444 --> 37:36.462
You okay?

37:36.464 --> 37:38.631
Yeah, never better.

38:07.861 --> 38:09.912
Wow.

38:09.914 --> 38:11.247
What'd he do?

38:12.199 --> 38:14.834
He didn't stay down.

38:21.108 --> 38:23.876
Why don't you just
go ahead and ask?

38:25.262 --> 38:27.379
About Roy.

38:28.215 --> 38:30.266
Okay.

38:30.268 --> 38:31.550
What about Roy?

38:34.038 --> 38:36.021
I should have told you
to go to hell.

38:36.023 --> 38:40.976
Well, you wouldn't have been the
first to make that suggestion.

38:40.978 --> 38:43.312
But, look, here you are.

38:43.314 --> 38:45.064
Why'd you offer me this?

38:45.066 --> 38:48.784
But the more intriguing
question, Roy, is:

38:48.786 --> 38:51.070
why did you accept?

38:53.540 --> 38:55.858
Redemption.

38:55.860 --> 38:58.077
Hers or yours?

39:01.515 --> 39:05.000
We used to work together,
a few years back.

39:06.219 --> 39:07.536
New York Field Office.

39:08.806 --> 39:11.707
We were partners.

39:11.709 --> 39:13.893
Roy was an agent.

39:14.878 --> 39:16.896
When did he stop
being an agent?

39:19.550 --> 39:20.983
When he got shot.

39:20.985 --> 39:24.653
What happened that night?

39:24.655 --> 39:26.739
What happened?

39:26.741 --> 39:28.574
You sent us out there, Hetty.

39:28.576 --> 39:29.859
You set up the operation.

39:29.861 --> 39:31.410
You know what happened.

39:31.412 --> 39:34.747
You were investigating
a weapons dealer in New York.

39:34.749 --> 39:37.733
You were ambushed in an alley.

39:37.735 --> 39:40.786
Three of the assailants
were killed.

39:40.788 --> 39:45.007
You were wounded,
you almost died.

39:45.009 --> 39:45.958
That's right.

39:45.960 --> 39:48.076
So why are you asking?

39:51.181 --> 39:54.583
Because that's not
the full story.

39:54.585 --> 39:56.769
I work alone now.

39:58.806 --> 40:00.773
I used to work alone.

40:00.775 --> 40:02.158
You miss it?

40:04.528 --> 40:06.862
Not since I've been
with the big fella.

40:06.864 --> 40:09.031
It's good to have
a partner.

40:11.168 --> 40:12.935
Mm.

40:12.937 --> 40:16.872
You and Paris were
such a good team.

40:16.874 --> 40:20.876
Why are you trying
to put us together again?

40:21.711 --> 40:26.665
As you said... redemption.

40:27.534 --> 40:29.752
Ours or yours?

40:33.357 --> 40:34.623
Oh.

40:37.311 --> 40:39.478
Yeah.

40:40.964 --> 40:43.465
Okay, we're on the way.

40:43.467 --> 40:45.467
We've got a lead on Spears.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.871
Working on the assumption that
Spears used his cell phone

40:48.873 --> 40:51.440
immediately after we
stopped the attack,

40:51.442 --> 40:53.158
we checked all
calls originating

40:53.160 --> 40:54.577
in and around the airport

40:54.579 --> 40:56.195
and came up with this.

40:57.647 --> 40:59.648
A call made to a
satellite phone

40:59.650 --> 41:01.951
3½ minutes
after Spears slipped away.

41:01.953 --> 41:05.387
NSA routinely records
satellite phone calls.

41:05.389 --> 41:07.122
This is what they got.

41:07.124 --> 41:08.824
I need you to get me
out of here now.

41:08.826 --> 41:10.726
Okay, I get it.

41:10.728 --> 41:12.895
Just saying, it's going to take
some time for me to organize.

41:12.897 --> 41:13.829
It's going to cost.

41:13.831 --> 41:15.047
How long?

41:15.049 --> 41:17.833
The day after
tomorrow, okay?

41:17.835 --> 41:19.935
There's a hotel--
the El Centro West Plaza.

41:19.937 --> 41:22.337
Book a room,
use the name Jackson.

41:22.339 --> 41:26.308
You hole up there and you wait
to be contacted.

41:26.310 --> 41:27.943
Stay away from
the border checkpoints.

41:27.945 --> 41:29.094
They'll be watching for you.

41:29.096 --> 41:32.031
The guy who smuggled you
over the border

41:32.033 --> 41:33.198
will take you back across.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.333
Have you got that?

41:34.335 --> 41:35.601
Yeah.

41:35.603 --> 41:37.069
Stay off the phone.

41:37.071 --> 41:39.354
Spears is English.

41:39.356 --> 41:40.856
The other guy sounds
like a contractor.

41:40.858 --> 41:42.908
Probably hired to provide
technical support.

41:42.910 --> 41:44.460
How far is El Centro?

41:44.462 --> 41:46.161
Three hours south,
right on the border.

41:46.163 --> 41:47.579
Spears is our priority.

41:47.581 --> 41:49.181
I don't want him coming back
to try this again

41:49.183 --> 41:50.950
with another terrorist cell.

41:50.952 --> 41:54.536
Mr. Callen, interrogate
the surviving terrorist

41:54.538 --> 41:56.755
and find our friend
on the satellite phone.

41:57.590 --> 41:59.591
Ms. Summerskill,

41:59.593 --> 42:01.927
get your team down to El Centro.

42:01.929 --> 42:04.897
Watch that hotel.
Yeah.

42:04.899 --> 42:06.765
And, Ms. Summerskill,

42:06.767 --> 42:09.568
you're still
a man down.

42:19.896 --> 42:22.081
Okay.

42:29.238 --> 42:34.238
