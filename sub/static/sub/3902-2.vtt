WEBVTT

00:09.176 --> 00:12.553
That's the witness,
the one from the Barksdale case.

00:12.638 --> 00:15.098
Gant, William. 41 years.

00:15.808 --> 00:20.269
Single headshot, close range.
Bullet pancaked on the inner skull.

00:26.068 --> 00:28.277
- Ain't necessarily what it looks like.
- No?

00:28.362 --> 00:30.530
A man's walking down the street
in West Baltimore.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.241
That'll catch you a bullet
for a half-dozen reasons.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.660
That it will. You run him for a sheet?

00:35.744 --> 00:39.455
Yeah, a couple of disorderlies.
Works maintenance at Poe Homes.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.166
Lives alone, no wife, no kids.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.669
Only time his name pops up
on the computer

00:44.753 --> 00:46.713
is for being a state witness.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.965
Otherwise I don't even make that connection.

00:53.470 --> 00:58.057
You've got to admit, it don't make sense to
ace this motherfucker after he done testified.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.517
Sends a hell of a message.

00:59.601 --> 01:03.563
He's the one hardheaded fuck in the Terrace
you can't run off or buy out.

01:03.647 --> 01:07.734
If your audience is the high-rises,
a move like this cuts through the shit.

01:07.818 --> 01:12.196
- What are you gonna tell the major?
- That I caught a stone fucking whodunnit.

01:12.281 --> 01:15.116
- Don't soft-sell the witness angle.
- Come on.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.202
Why get the bosses riled
before we know for sure?

01:18.287 --> 01:20.705
If I start talking shit that a witness got killed...

01:20.789 --> 01:22.457
- Tell him.
- Why?

01:22.541 --> 01:24.375
Just cover yourself on this.

01:24.460 --> 01:27.879
Jimmy, you ain't gonna do what I think?

01:30.340 --> 01:32.258
Listen to me.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.219
This shit is gonna jump up
and bite you in your ass.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.722
Just cover yourself.

01:37.806 --> 01:41.768
- What the hell was that about?
- Nothing.

01:49.276 --> 01:52.361
If you walk through the garden

01:53.238 --> 01:55.615
You better watch your back

01:56.658 --> 01:59.911
Well, I beg your pardon

02:00.496 --> 02:02.914
Walk the straight and narrow track

02:04.875 --> 02:06.918
If you walk with Jesus

02:08.711 --> 02:11.547
He'll save your soul

02:12.883 --> 02:14.842
You gotta keep the devil

02:15.803 --> 02:17.678
Down in the hole

02:19.598 --> 02:22.350
All the angels sing

02:23.268 --> 02:25.728
About Jesus' mighty sword

02:26.855 --> 02:29.732
And they shield you with their wings

02:30.526 --> 02:33.736
Keep you close to the Lord

02:34.780 --> 02:37.323
Don't pay heed to temptation

02:38.367 --> 02:41.911
For his hands are so cold

02:42.871 --> 02:45.373
You gotta keep the devil

02:45.791 --> 02:49.377
Way down in the hole

02:57.511 --> 02:59.720
Way down in the hole

03:01.348 --> 03:03.599
Way down in the hole

03:05.185 --> 03:08.229
Way down in the hole

03:08.313 --> 03:11.440
Way down in the hole

03:27.457 --> 03:29.625
Morning.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.177
Jesus Christ.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.105
Goddamn.

04:33.190 --> 04:36.567
Who do you got to fuck in this town
to get a real office?

04:36.652 --> 04:39.737
At least that works.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.542
It was for McNulty.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.464
- I shouldn't be here.
- Then you shouldn't.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.467
They killed a fucking witness
out of your court.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.136
You told me. You did your civic duty.

05:04.221 --> 05:07.515
Under the power vested in me
by the circuit court for Baltimore city,

05:07.599 --> 05:09.809
I absolve you of your sins, Detective.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.852
You are my sin, you know that?

05:11.937 --> 05:15.314
For talking to you,
my major is ready to cut my throat.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.566
Jimmy, you knew I was gonna make that call.

05:17.651 --> 05:21.696
I didn't think you would hang me out
on the line in a shitstorm.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.740
It's not like it was when I was a prosecutor.

05:24.825 --> 05:28.411
- I'm a judge now. The rules are different.
- You missed a spot.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.496
Yeah, well, what's done is done.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.542
Question is, what do you want me to do now?

05:34.626 --> 05:38.587
- You can leverage the Deputy Ops with a call.
- He's already detailed people.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.883
Some detail. Asshole lieutenant thinks
he can buy-bust his way to Avon Barksdale.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.468
You want leverage?

05:44.553 --> 05:48.514
We give the dead-witness angle
to the newspapers. Stir some real shit.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.683
That tips Barksdale we're working him.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.352
- We don't want to go public.
- No?

05:53.437 --> 05:57.273
Just put it to the Deputy Ops you lost
a witness who testified in your court,

05:57.357 --> 06:00.317
forcing the department
to commit to the investigation.

06:00.402 --> 06:04.363
And when you call Burrell this time,
will you forget my fucking name?

06:10.829 --> 06:11.871
Hey!

06:11.955 --> 06:15.207
- You missed a spot.
- Why don't you fucking do it?

06:15.292 --> 06:16.959
Seniority.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.478
- You found us.
- Wasn't easy.

06:35.562 --> 06:39.023
- You asked for these guys?
- I asked for more manpower.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.943
Have a seat.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.370
What the fuck...

06:55.165 --> 06:56.624
Sir, I...

06:56.708 --> 06:59.251
He was showing me
the trigger pull on his Glock.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.963
- And he was just...
- Detective?

07:04.007 --> 07:06.675
Officer Pryzbylewski shot the wall,
Lieutenant.

07:07.511 --> 07:08.552
Why?

07:08.637 --> 07:11.138
Why did you shoot the wall, Pryzbylewski?

07:11.223 --> 07:15.601
I was just showing Carv
how my trigger pull is light, you know.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.687
- I got it so it's real light.
- He took the clip out, boss.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.148
But not the one in the chamber.

07:21.233 --> 07:24.527
No, I forgot the one in the chamber

07:24.611 --> 07:27.321
and, uh...well...

07:27.405 --> 07:29.573
Shit, I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.952
- You want him to write on it?
- Write on what?

07:33.036 --> 07:37.373
You let one go, you got to write.
You got to justify the use of deadly force.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.583
Against a plaster wall.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.463
It's an accident, OK?
Give me a fucking break.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.467
- Your name is what?
- Pryzbylewski.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.556
From Auto Unit, right? Cantrell sent you.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.392
Not exactly.

07:56.476 --> 08:01.438
Lieutenant Cantrell sent me to Casualty
Section a couple of months back.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.983
And I asked out of Casualty.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.573
You came here from Casualty Section?

08:12.784 --> 08:14.785
Man, these shits is right, yo.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.788
Mm-hm.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.543
- It's good with the hot sauce, too.
- Most definite.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.589
- Yo, D, want some nuggets?
- No, go ahead, man.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.717
Man, whoever invented these,
he off the hook.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.260
Word!

08:31.344 --> 08:35.097
Mm. Motherfucker got the bone
all the way out the damn chicken.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.017
Till he came along,
niggers be chewing on drumsticks,

08:38.101 --> 08:40.059
getting they fingers all greasy.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.104
He said, "Later," to the bone.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.565
Nugget that meat up,
make some real money.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.443
- You think the man got paid?
- Who?

08:47.527 --> 08:50.696
- Man who invented these.
- He richer than a motherfucker.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.616
Why? You think he get a percentage?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.702
- Why not?
- Nigger, please.

08:56.786 --> 09:01.081
The man who invented them, some sad-ass
down at the basement of McDonald's

09:01.166 --> 09:03.709
thinking up shit
to make money for the real players.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.462
- No man, that ain't right.
- Fuck right.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.756
It ain't about right, it's about money.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.759
You think Ronald McDonald
gonna go down that basement

09:11.843 --> 09:14.261
and say, "Mr. Nugget, you the bomb.

09:14.346 --> 09:17.348
"We selling chicken faster
than you can tear the bone out.

09:17.432 --> 09:21.685
"So I'm gonna write my clowny-ass name
on this fat-ass check for you."

09:21.770 --> 09:23.103
Shit.

09:23.688 --> 09:27.608
The nigger who invented them things,
still in the basement on regular wage

09:27.692 --> 09:31.278
thinking of some shit
to make the fries taste better.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.197
Believe.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.869
He still had the idea, though.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.253
Who?

09:47.337 --> 09:50.339
Polk and Pat Mahone.
A couple of drunks from Property.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.299
- I don't know them.
- Why would you?

09:52.384 --> 09:54.760
They haven't made a case in 10 years.

09:54.844 --> 09:58.180
Also got handed some kid.
Prezbelowski or Prezbelewski...

09:58.265 --> 10:01.767
- Pryzbylewski. Him, I know.
- Yeah?

10:01.851 --> 10:05.229
- Why was he in Casualty Section?
- He shot up his own car.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.648
- You remember?
- He did what?

10:07.732 --> 10:11.277
He fired two clips into an unmarked car,
out in West Baltimore.

10:11.361 --> 10:15.322
Called in a signal 13 on the radio,
like he was under fire from a sniper.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.449
You didn't hear about that?

10:17.534 --> 10:22.246
He stuck to his story until Ballistics matched
the bullet to his off-duty weapon.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.457
- We almost indicted him for false report.
- Why didn't you?

10:25.542 --> 10:28.502
He's got some kind of suction
with the Mayor's office.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.630
My point is, I can't build much
with the garbage they sent me.

10:31.715 --> 10:35.175
So go to the deputy.
You've got his ear on this.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.554
Why not?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.639
I ask the deputy for manpower.

10:40.724 --> 10:44.143
He tells Property to send two men,
and Special to send two more.

10:44.227 --> 10:47.604
Those shift lieutenants know it's a chance
to dump their dead wood.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.982
The deputy, he knows this, too.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.359
He could have offered
to let me pick but didn't.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.571
- He sent me a message on this.
- And the message is?

10:55.655 --> 10:58.198
Don't dig in, don't get fancy.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.909
Put a quick charge on this Barksdale
and then get out.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.246
If he sends me good police,
I might do good police work.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.584
- But if the State's Attorney's office...
- No.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.098
Rhonda, darling...

11:23.641 --> 11:27.561
it's bad protocol for me to ask for help
and then trash the help I'm given.

11:27.645 --> 11:31.357
- You, on the other hand...
- No way. My office doesn't play that way.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.276
You people staff your cases,
you bring us casework.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.112
I cross that line, I like piss everyone off.

11:39.574 --> 11:42.493
Best I can do is tell my unit chief
that you drew shit.

11:42.577 --> 11:46.205
He wants to call the deputy for operations,
that's his choice.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.624
- That won't happen.
- Probably not.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.295
Make lemonade.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.238
Ah, fuck!

12:19.322 --> 12:21.865
Yo, Kima, where you taking us?

12:21.950 --> 12:23.534
- Get down.
- What?

12:23.618 --> 12:26.745
Jesus. You all ain't got no creep to you.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.581
Pair of goddamn elephants.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.212
A rusted nail just went through my shoe.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.799
I'm gonna need a tetanus
to get behind this bullshit.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.805
- Hey, Kima.
- Hand me that bag.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.729
Kima, if you don't mind me asking,

12:52.814 --> 12:57.484
when was it that you first figured
you liked women better than men?

12:57.569 --> 12:59.361
I mind you asking.

13:06.661 --> 13:09.663
Gentlemen, what's going on there, guys?

13:09.747 --> 13:12.458
- Testers, man, already out.
- No.

13:12.542 --> 13:16.170
I'm not in need of your services,
I'm offering my services to y'all.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.546
What you got in the bag?

13:17.630 --> 13:21.884
One thing a gentleman of color like better
than a new pair of downtown shoes

13:22.051 --> 13:24.094
is a downtown brim, right?

13:52.457 --> 13:54.124
What's with the hats?

14:04.302 --> 14:06.261
- Five-O!
- Five-O!

14:07.222 --> 14:08.805
Shut it down!

14:12.185 --> 14:13.685
Shut it down!

14:18.441 --> 14:19.942
Clean?

14:49.222 --> 14:52.307
You ain't gonna put that one on me.
He a witness.

14:52.392 --> 14:56.270
You picked that shit up off the ground,
so don't be trying to put shit on me.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.480
Is that what you think I'm about?

14:59.649 --> 15:01.733
- Boy thinks I'm gonna dirty him.
- Hm.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.194
Like y'all won't do it.

15:04.279 --> 15:07.114
Western narcos come here,
pick shit up off the ground

15:07.198 --> 15:09.199
put it on whoever you please.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.119
Do I know you?

15:12.203 --> 15:15.747
Let's understand each other.
I'm not Western District.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.333
I'm not a narco. I don't dirty people

15:18.418 --> 15:20.627
'cause I don't care
about a possession charge.

15:20.712 --> 15:24.172
I'm a murder police,
I'm here about the bodies.

15:25.383 --> 15:28.552
D'Angelo here knows that.
He remembers me from the trial.

15:28.636 --> 15:32.764
Sitting in back there, behind Stringer,
watching, listening.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.309
Y'all hassling me about that shit?

15:35.393 --> 15:37.394
I thought you heard what the jury said.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.897
- Fuck the jury.
- Yeah, this is just us talking, right?

15:40.982 --> 15:44.443
Just you, me, my partner and...
What did you say your name was?

15:44.527 --> 15:46.028
I didn't say shit.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.322
Just you, me, my partner and Mr. Shit here.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.825
We're just talking about how things go, right?

15:51.909 --> 15:55.787
We're just sharing our thoughts.
Bunk, a vial for your thoughts.

15:55.872 --> 15:59.625
I'm thinking it's one thing for
one of you little niggers

15:59.709 --> 16:03.837
to shoot somebody in the 221 Building,
you know? Who gives a fuck?

16:03.921 --> 16:06.298
- But when you ace a witness...
- A working man.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.550
...who ain't even in the game...

16:09.469 --> 16:11.219
You gonna act like this is news?

16:13.056 --> 16:16.808
I tell you this, I don't know shit about shit,
but I do know this -

16:16.893 --> 16:20.812
anybody who spend time witnessing shit,
you gonna get got.

16:21.648 --> 16:25.817
I know that sounds kinda harsh
but that's the way things go around here...

16:25.902 --> 16:27.944
Officer.

16:29.572 --> 16:30.739
Let's roll.

16:42.627 --> 16:46.505
That how you see things, D'Angelo?
Like your friend here?

16:52.095 --> 16:55.722
I'm here trying to outfit niggers
with something to rile up some pussy.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.684
You don't want to know,
Bubbles used to get that pussy.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.479
I reckon pussy ain't worth what it used to be

17:02.563 --> 17:05.272
if you can do it without a proper brim.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.382
- Something's up.
- What?

17:31.092 --> 17:32.467
Don't know.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.556
Yo, Carv. Come here.

17:38.599 --> 17:42.477
You see Bubbs put a hat on anybody,
you take some pictures.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.563
- Yeah?
- Especially the red one.

17:44.647 --> 17:47.733
If you see him put that red hat
on anybody's head

17:47.817 --> 17:49.568
snap your fucking fingers off.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.653
Where you going?

17:52.530 --> 17:55.365
Yo, Carv. Notice that most of the time

17:55.450 --> 17:58.160
it's like Kima thinks
she's above us or something?

17:58.244 --> 18:02.456
I don't see any stripes
on her fucking sleeve. I don't see that.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.250
All I see is some stuck-up dyke bitch

18:05.334 --> 18:07.544
who ain't been in CID
half the time you or me,

18:07.628 --> 18:10.046
and she's fucking telling us what to do.

18:10.131 --> 18:13.425
It ain't right. You think it's right?

18:13.509 --> 18:17.846
Shut up for just a minute.
I'm trying to concentrate on this shit here.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.437
Nice truck.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.398
Uh-huh.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.278
No? Makes your breath minty fresh.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.114
Is y'all gonna arrest me? Then arrest me.

18:36.199 --> 18:37.532
If not, shut the fuck up.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.284
- You want to get arrested?
- No.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.162
- Shut the fuck up your own self.
- I'm outta here.

18:42.246 --> 18:45.874
Hey, hey! D'Angelo.
You better bend the fuck over.

18:49.462 --> 18:53.131
- You ain't got nothing else to do today?
- No, no, nothing.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.759
Y'all ain't got no charge.

18:59.347 --> 19:04.267
You getting awfully close, man.
You new on the force or some shit?

19:14.695 --> 19:16.696
All right, D.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.641
Move it, move it.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.945
Hey, it's Greggs. Get me the lieutenant.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.494
Prez? He's no good to anyone, he's a goof.

20:04.579 --> 20:08.206
How is he my problem?
How is he still carrying a gun and badge?

20:08.291 --> 20:10.250
You know Valchek in Southeast?

20:10.334 --> 20:12.627
- Yeah.
- Son-in-law.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.172
I can't carry him on this.
You know who Special sent me?

20:16.257 --> 20:18.633
- Who?
- Polk and Mahone.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.219
With them,
I don't have a designated driver.

20:21.304 --> 20:25.599
- I gave you someone from Pawnshop.
- Lester Freamon? A cuddly housecat.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.809
I don't think he can even find his gun.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.938
Take Pryzbylewski back.

20:32.023 --> 20:35.483
You know I can't. I would, but I can't.
I gave Valchek my word.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.320
I can't help it that Prez
is fucking the guy's daughter.

20:38.404 --> 20:42.032
- If not for that, he's gone.
- So, you got suction with Valchek?

20:42.241 --> 20:45.660
If I cross him,
I'm fucked on the next round of promotions.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.455
I'm with you on the short list for major.

20:48.539 --> 20:51.374
Valchek has suction
with the Democratic Club,

20:51.459 --> 20:55.503
they got suction with the Mayor
and I'm the runt without a tit here.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.589
I owe you, OK?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.926
- So, give me Sydnor.
- No way.

21:01.010 --> 21:04.262
- Give me Sydnor and I'll keep Prez.
- You can't take my best man.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.641
- I'm taking your worst, remember?
- How about Steinman?

21:07.725 --> 21:09.893
I'm working drugs in West Baltimore.

21:09.977 --> 21:13.730
I need a black guy for surveillance. Sydnor.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.858
- Know what Prez did this morning?
- Tell me.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.946
He put a bullet through a wall,
dry-firing in the detail office.

21:21.030 --> 21:24.991
No promises. You give me Sydnor,
I'll carry Pryzbylewski as long as I can.

21:25.076 --> 21:28.286
Fine, Cedric, fuck, whatever. Jesus Christ.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.461
How did you handle the judge?

21:36.545 --> 21:39.506
I told him we were looking
closely at the situation.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.425
I asked him not to say anything publicly.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.304
So, then he's not gonna go public, right?

21:47.932 --> 21:49.557
Judge Phelan called,

21:49.642 --> 21:52.644
crying about a witness
in his murder trial who was killed.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.896
Did the judge say where he heard it?

21:55.106 --> 21:59.359
He heard it from our man, McNulty.
That's his pipeline on this crap.

21:59.443 --> 22:04.322
Pardon my French, but I got no problem
giving that asshole up at this point.

22:04.407 --> 22:07.325
- I don't need people I can't trust.
- Yeah, who does?

22:07.410 --> 22:10.829
The newspapers get hold of this,
it'll be a complete clusterfuck.

22:10.913 --> 22:14.082
So the thing to do is reassure the judge,

22:14.166 --> 22:16.668
keep him off his damn soapbox.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.878
An arrest or two would help.

22:20.256 --> 22:24.634
What if it's true? What if Barksdale ordered
the murder of a state's witness?

22:24.719 --> 22:26.177
Are you serious?

22:26.262 --> 22:28.805
Why would anyone do that
after they testify?

22:28.889 --> 22:32.267
- It has no effect on the case.
- Payback, plain and simple.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.352
Bullshit, plain and simple.

22:34.437 --> 22:38.732
I know there could be two dozen reasons
for this man to be murdered but...

22:38.816 --> 22:43.194
No money for pretrial.
No witness protection program.

22:43.279 --> 22:46.740
Look, this is a poor fucking city, gentlemen.

22:46.824 --> 22:51.369
The last thing we ever need to do
is to announce we lost a witness.

22:51.454 --> 22:55.540
It's hard enough pushing felony casework
through that courthouse as it is.

22:55.624 --> 22:59.544
- You got to pull McNulty off this.
- Who caught the murder case?

22:59.628 --> 23:02.964
- Bunk Moreland, McNulty's partner.
- You'd have to pull him, too.

23:03.174 --> 23:07.677
No, we pull McNulty up,
the judge will bring the press into this.

23:07.762 --> 23:10.180
I can see that a mile away.

23:10.264 --> 23:13.725
No, we're gonna sit tight,
let McNulty take his best shot

23:13.809 --> 23:16.644
and hope like hell he comes up short.

23:18.647 --> 23:22.150
- How do you wanna handle this?
- We got nothing on him.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.904
- We try to front, he'll see right through us.
- He's scared though. Soft.

23:27.198 --> 23:29.199
Go with the deuce?

23:30.201 --> 23:32.202
Hold up, hold up.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.376
- He part of my case?
- No, sir.

23:40.461 --> 23:43.296
He's a potential suspect in my murder.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.883
Which might be part of my case.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.931
I could use some coffee.
You want some coffee?

23:57.937 --> 24:00.230
- I need a word with you.
- We're about to...

24:00.314 --> 24:01.356
Now.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.612
Remember all that bullshit I gave you
about keeping me informed,

24:07.696 --> 24:09.614
about nothing happening
that I don't know about?

24:09.698 --> 24:11.491
- Lieutenant.
- Wasn't bullshit.

24:11.575 --> 24:15.036
My partner caught a murder.
It may have nothing to do with Barksdale.

24:15.246 --> 24:17.288
I just came from Deputy Ops' office

24:17.373 --> 24:19.958
where your own major's
telling Burrell to do you.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.293
You hear me? Rawls is giving you up.

24:22.378 --> 24:25.713
- What the fuck did I do?
- You can't shut your mouth.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.467
You think that downtown judge
is gonna bail your ass out?

24:29.552 --> 24:32.804
You really think that?
You should have come to me.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.807
We bring this business to the deputy first,
we got a shot.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.309
But you're out there all alone, jumping bad.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.645
- You got the deputy's ear?
- On this case, I do.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.106
Then how come they sent
every worthless hump?

24:43.190 --> 24:46.568
You ask for men,
they send you drunks and fuck-ups.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.738
I want to do this case.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.282
So do I.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.868
Then you're gonna get all the way in,
Lieutenant.

24:54.952 --> 24:59.247
If I see you get all the way in,
then I know who you are, what you're about.

24:59.331 --> 25:03.001
- Who is he?
- He's D'Angelo Barksdale.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.003
Nephew to the king.

25:05.087 --> 25:08.256
- The one that beat the murder.
- Yeah, him.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.216
Can you connect him to the dead witness?

25:10.301 --> 25:13.344
- Not a thing.
- Why did you pick him up?

25:14.930 --> 25:18.600
Press him. See what kind of flex he shows.

25:19.476 --> 25:22.604
- She goes in with you.
- We don't need her.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.647
Bunk and me, we got our own rhythm.

25:24.732 --> 25:28.568
You want me in, McNulty?
I thought you said you wanted me in.

25:30.279 --> 25:34.782
You're along for this interview,
but it's Homicide's play, so let 'em lead.

25:39.496 --> 25:42.207
You might want to run
tag and title on these trucks.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.417
They scoped us when we jacked the kid.

25:44.501 --> 25:48.213
Been there. Info's already in the file.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.799
Y'all weren't the only lawmen
down in the Canyon today.

25:51.884 --> 25:55.220
- Really, where were you?
- Where was she?

26:01.852 --> 26:05.897
I mean, the thing is,
I can't see a reason for that man to be dead.

26:05.981 --> 26:08.900
I can't. I mean, hell, you beat us in court.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.985
- We don't take it personal.
- Fuck, no.

26:11.195 --> 26:14.948
We get paid either way.
And it's not like you did anything real bad,

26:15.032 --> 26:17.408
throwing a couple of hot ones
at Pooh Blanchard.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.452
No one's gonna miss that motherfucker.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.038
But you know the man
who got killed this time?

26:22.122 --> 26:24.415
You know who that poor son of a bitch was?

26:24.500 --> 26:25.625
A citizen.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.878
Worked every goddamn day of his life.
You know that?

26:28.963 --> 26:32.757
He would get up every day,
go out and do maintenance work.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.593
On the weekends, he was driving a cab.

26:35.678 --> 26:39.639
Two jobs. He volunteers what little time
he has left at his church.

26:39.723 --> 26:43.268
- Churchgoing man.
- A Bethel man, a deacon.

26:43.352 --> 26:47.480
Two jobs and three kids.
Did you know that?

26:47.564 --> 26:50.108
Three kids. Young, too.

26:50.192 --> 26:53.319
Five, eight, eleven.

26:54.029 --> 26:58.449
Crying their little orphaned asses to sleep
'cause they lost their mama...

26:58.534 --> 27:01.160
...and now they out there on their own.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.748
He doesn't believe us.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.959
I know he don't believe it.

27:08.043 --> 27:11.212
We've been here two hours,
telling you what's true

27:11.297 --> 27:12.922
and you sit like nothing happened.

27:13.007 --> 27:16.134
- Where my lawyer at?
- When he gets here, we'll let you know.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.428
I got nothing to say.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.930
I'm sorry for the man
but I got nothing to say.

27:21.015 --> 27:24.684
You sorry? You sorry for him?
You fucking killed the man.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.811
- No.
- Yes, you did.

27:26.895 --> 27:29.397
We don't think that you shot him or anything

27:29.481 --> 27:32.400
but if you weren't busy
lighting folks up in a lobby,

27:32.484 --> 27:34.444
he ain't coming out and seeing it.

27:34.528 --> 27:38.990
He don't see anything, he doesn't testify
and those kids still got a daddy.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.326
- Why he testify?
- How should we know?

27:41.410 --> 27:44.620
- He didn't have to testify.
- No, he didn't, but he did.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.748
And you still beat the charge.

27:46.832 --> 27:49.250
But it's not enough to beat the murder.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.627
They gotta send a cold message
to everyone in the Terrace.

27:51.712 --> 27:55.256
Fuck the working man.
Fuck his kids, that shit don't count.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.803
That's what I don't get about the drug thing.

28:00.888 --> 28:04.223
Why can't you sell the shit
and walk the fuck away?

28:06.101 --> 28:08.061
Know what I mean?
Everything else in this country gets sold

28:08.145 --> 28:10.521
without people shooting each other.

28:10.606 --> 28:13.483
In the Terrace, it's one body after another.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.069
Remember that little boy,

28:16.153 --> 28:19.781
got shot in the barbershop
on West Lombard last summer?

28:20.866 --> 28:24.160
One asshole chases another into a house,

28:24.244 --> 28:25.620
empties a 9.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.373
Bullshit argument over 20 missing gel caps.

28:30.250 --> 28:34.379
That little kid, instead of getting
his first haircut, gets one in the eye.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.714
Remember that?

28:36.799 --> 28:39.634
- It's fucked up.
- Yes, it is.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.097
They didn't have to do that.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.391
Shoot up a barbershop?

28:46.475 --> 28:48.559
No, they did not have to do that.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.481
That man was just...

28:55.776 --> 28:57.318
my thing.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.156
My thing, ain't had...

29:03.492 --> 29:05.326
They ain't had to do that.

29:14.795 --> 29:16.712
No mommy and no daddy.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.549
Lord Jesus!

29:24.221 --> 29:26.806
I'll tell you what I think
you should do, D'Angelo,

29:28.058 --> 29:30.852
not because I think you wanted
that man to get shot

29:30.936 --> 29:33.563
or had anything to do with shooting him.

29:33.647 --> 29:37.108
But I think you could just sit here

29:37.192 --> 29:41.320
for a moment or two, collect your thoughts,
get your shit together.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.240
And then I think it might be a good thing

29:44.324 --> 29:47.827
for you to write a little letter
to those children

29:47.911 --> 29:50.663
and you let 'em know you sorry...

29:52.249 --> 29:55.710
that they're not gonna have
anyone left, you know?

29:56.795 --> 29:58.754
I mean, just say something.

29:58.839 --> 30:01.924
Tell them how you personally
think your uncle...

30:02.009 --> 30:03.551
maybe he got it wrong,

30:03.635 --> 30:08.848
because it's wrong that they lost their daddy
behind what happened, you know?

30:11.393 --> 30:15.396
It might mean something to 'em to know
that you feeling for 'em.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.238
Man, I ain't got nothing to say.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.742
Just say what's in your heart.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.724
Church deacon? That was thick.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.268
Got good to me, what can I say?

30:54.978 --> 30:58.064
It's sad enough with the kids
being orphaned.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.816
Photo was from Bunk's desk.

31:02.778 --> 31:05.321
- They're yours?
- Yeah, afraid so.

31:06.782 --> 31:09.534
- Good thing they look like their mama.
- Huh!

31:09.618 --> 31:12.954
Maurice Levy just posted.
He's by the elevators.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.714
- The defense never rests.
- Shame on you.

31:23.799 --> 31:26.676
Dragging me from the family preserve
on a Friday night.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.136
- My apologies.
- Yvette made brisket.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.639
- Good?
- When served hot. One or two?

31:32.558 --> 31:34.100
Your client.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.310
What the fuck? Stop writing! Now!

31:36.395 --> 31:38.312
- I'm just...
- Shut up!

31:38.897 --> 31:42.149
He calls his lawyer, that's supposed to be
the end of the interview.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.569
Your client gave no statement.

31:44.653 --> 31:48.531
He just decided, voluntarily,
to write a letter to the victim's family.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.866
- To say that...
- Shut up!

31:52.995 --> 31:55.496
- Any charge here?
- No charge.

31:55.581 --> 31:59.125
Good. Get up. Go! Walk!

32:02.087 --> 32:03.963
Listen to me, you don't say anything,

32:04.047 --> 32:06.424
don't do anything,
don't write anything.

32:06.508 --> 32:08.092
Do you hear me? Shut up!

32:09.344 --> 32:13.472
How many fucking times do I have to tell
you people the same fucking thing?

32:28.030 --> 32:30.031
What the fuck is that?

32:32.701 --> 32:36.704
It's an armoire. Louis XIV.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.041
I mean, what is it, a toy?

32:41.752 --> 32:44.879
Some of you I know.
Some of you I will know.

32:45.422 --> 32:48.549
If you've worked with me before,
you know I don't want cowboy shit

32:48.634 --> 32:50.801
or surprises.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.887
The task...

32:56.058 --> 33:00.144
is Avon Barksdale, and Avon Barksdale only.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.771
No side trips, no sprawl.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.485
Primary investigators
are Greggs from my unit and...

33:10.572 --> 33:14.116
Greggs from my unit
and McNulty from Homicide.

33:14.201 --> 33:18.037
They keep the file.
On the street, we work partners.

33:18.789 --> 33:21.707
Greggs and Sydnor. Herc and Carver.

33:21.792 --> 33:25.628
McNulty's with Santangelo,
Mahone and Polk.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.296
Pryzbylewski and Freamon.

33:28.090 --> 33:29.715
To start with, we got nine...

33:29.800 --> 33:32.718
How's that? Did that get it?

33:32.803 --> 33:36.138
- What?
- Do you hear me?

33:36.598 --> 33:38.224
What?

33:39.851 --> 33:44.730
We have nine or ten open homicide files
to work back through for leads.

33:44.815 --> 33:47.483
McNulty and Santangelo,
they're on that.

33:47.567 --> 33:52.029
Herc, Carver, Sydnor, and me,
we'll be targeting street dealers

33:52.114 --> 33:54.573
and rolling them back up
at Barksdale's people.

33:54.658 --> 33:57.868
Polk and Mahone are available
to run down specific leads.

33:58.078 --> 34:02.039
Freamon, Pryzbylewski,
are gonna start in-office on clerical duty.

34:02.124 --> 34:05.626
- You need a prosecutor...
- No, turn the shit off!

34:06.169 --> 34:08.504
What?

34:08.588 --> 34:10.380
You need a prosecutor.

34:10.465 --> 34:13.259
Rhonda Pearlman from Narcotics is assigned.

34:14.302 --> 34:17.471
We don't have enough desks yet,
so we gotta share...

34:17.556 --> 34:20.349
- Y'all from Purchasing?
- No.

34:26.523 --> 34:30.818
We've been promised some computers
and surveillance equipment.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.070
- Questions?
- Yeah.

34:33.155 --> 34:35.281
Who signs the overtime slips?

34:35.364 --> 34:37.824
No OT, unless prior authorization.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.454
A case goes from red to black
by way of green, Lieutenant.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.581
You people bring me
something that needs OT,

34:44.666 --> 34:46.292
you'll get OT.

34:46.376 --> 34:49.837
Until then, live on your fucking salaries.

35:02.267 --> 35:06.520
"I'm very sorry for your father.
If I could've stopped it, I would have."

35:07.814 --> 35:11.150
- What can you do with this?
- Nothing legally.

35:11.234 --> 35:15.112
He doesn't put himself in,
or anyone else for that matter.

35:15.197 --> 35:16.947
You can't read that letter

35:17.157 --> 35:20.451
and think that man was killed
for any other reason than he was a witness.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.537
Why apologize at all
if you got nothing to do with it?

35:30.295 --> 35:31.962
We lost a state's witness.

35:32.172 --> 35:35.466
Even in Baltimore,
that's supposed to mean something, right?

35:35.550 --> 35:37.802
Just go to the deputy,
show him what's what

35:37.886 --> 35:39.762
and put something real together.

35:39.846 --> 35:43.516
This case needs informants,
it needs long-term surveillance

35:43.600 --> 35:45.476
and eventually, a Title 3 wiretap.

35:45.560 --> 35:50.314
Most of all, it needs police who know
how to work those things.

35:51.316 --> 35:54.652
You think it's good to put it out on the street
that witnesses get killed?

35:54.736 --> 35:57.446
You think it's not on the street already?

36:00.408 --> 36:01.826
No grandstanding.

36:01.910 --> 36:04.954
Like I said, we get in and out.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.390
- Hey, Aunt June.
- Hey, sweetie.

36:25.934 --> 36:28.894
Yeah, I hope you're hungry.

36:28.979 --> 36:30.771
Starving.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.356
Hey, D!

36:33.608 --> 36:34.900
What's up, baby?

36:34.985 --> 36:37.653
- That your uncle?
- Yeah.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.363
I thought he'd look different.

36:39.447 --> 36:42.408
My man, D. What's up, man?

36:42.492 --> 36:44.952
- This the little man? Whoo!
- Yo.

36:45.662 --> 36:48.873
You see how shorty
favor your nephew here?

36:48.957 --> 36:52.334
What's up, little man?
You ain't gonna be able to deny that child.

36:52.419 --> 36:56.255
You wanna come to me?
I know you tryin' to come to me.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.965
- Been napping.
- Yeah?

36:58.049 --> 37:01.385
- Just woke up.
- You got a grip? Let me see your grip.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.555
C'mon, give us a twirl, let's take a look.

37:04.639 --> 37:07.892
- La, la, la.
- What you looking at?

37:07.976 --> 37:12.521
Go fix her a hot plate. Put everything on it.
She's the skinniest thing in here.

37:12.606 --> 37:13.939
We gonna hook you up.

37:14.024 --> 37:16.317
Don't let that fool you, she can eat, man.

37:16.401 --> 37:20.321
- How y'all doing? You doing good?
- Yeah, we all right.

37:20.405 --> 37:23.407
She want me to move in,
I'm thinking about it.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.910
Let's walk.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.830
Here you come.
You gonna take my man from me?

37:29.915 --> 37:33.459
- Yeah.
- Be careful with my little soldier.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.670
- Got a name for that one?
- No.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.758
But he's one of the boys
they use in the stairwell.

37:40.842 --> 37:43.928
- What about him?
- That's Little Man.

37:44.012 --> 37:45.679
He's muscle.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.349
You know his real name?

37:50.352 --> 37:52.811
- CI?
- Yeah.

37:52.896 --> 37:56.065
- You need some privacy?
- No, it's all right.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.525
He's cool.

38:00.654 --> 38:02.780
What's with the hat?

38:02.864 --> 38:05.324
Go ahead, tell him, Bubbles.

38:05.992 --> 38:09.286
I go down the way
with some hats that I'm selling.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.497
If someone is someone you need to know

38:11.581 --> 38:15.125
I put the red hat on them
and Kima here take the pictures.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.379
If they in the mix, they get another color.
If they ain't shit, they don't get shit.

38:18.463 --> 38:21.507
Everyone in the hat's
part of Barksdale's crew?

38:21.591 --> 38:23.384
At the Terrace.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.678
We haven't hit the low-rises yet.

38:26.763 --> 38:29.807
That's sharp. I like that.

38:29.891 --> 38:31.642
Bubbs does not forget a face.

38:31.726 --> 38:34.937
Ain't so good with names,
but faces I keep in my head.

38:35.021 --> 38:38.816
I used to take him to Escape Unit,
let him look through the warrant books.

38:38.900 --> 38:43.404
He'd call me up that night,
telling me to go to this corner, that corner.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.782
Yeah, paid $25 a pop.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.909
- That's good money.
- Yeah.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.578
How much does the hat routine pay?

38:52.122 --> 38:53.831
Nothing.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.041
We free on this.

38:57.711 --> 39:01.088
- Motherfuckers beat my boy down.
- Who?

39:01.172 --> 39:03.257
Little hoppers in the low-rises.

39:03.383 --> 39:06.510
- Who's your boy?
- I got a friend.

39:07.887 --> 39:12.057
Younger white boy. Used to come down
to the corners, real green.

39:12.142 --> 39:13.684
I was schooling him, you know?

39:13.768 --> 39:16.603
What happened?

39:16.730 --> 39:19.565
- They stomped him.
- You see it?

39:22.610 --> 39:26.155
Fuck a man like that up
for a couple of dollars, you know?

39:26.239 --> 39:28.866
He still at University, tubes all up in his nose.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.285
Can't say but a fucking word or two.

39:33.455 --> 39:35.914
But you know, that's how it goes, right?

39:36.624 --> 39:38.709
How you feeling, Bubbs?

39:38.793 --> 39:41.545
Restless.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.840
Yeah, I could tell.

39:44.924 --> 39:48.635
What the fuck? Can you hook a nigger up
with $10 then till tomorrow?

39:48.720 --> 39:51.555
I mean, you know, just to carry me, Kima.

39:57.771 --> 39:59.646
Bubbs.

40:01.441 --> 40:03.275
Obliged.

40:04.486 --> 40:07.154
Stay out of the projects
the next couple of days.

40:07.238 --> 40:10.407
- Just to be safe.
- This girl's always fretting over me.

40:12.202 --> 40:14.161
- Change it up, Bubbs.
- Yeah, yeah.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.829
Go eastside.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.332
Yeah, yeah.

40:19.626 --> 40:20.793
Twenty dollars?

40:20.877 --> 40:23.587
You gonna spoil him with that shit.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.964
I respect the work.

40:27.592 --> 40:30.344
They used your name, Stringer,

40:30.428 --> 40:32.179
Wee-Bey,

40:32.263 --> 40:34.014
Savino, Peanut...

40:35.266 --> 40:37.768
They knew a lot of names. They knew a lot.

40:37.852 --> 40:39.853
But you didn't say nothing?

40:41.231 --> 40:43.524
Shit, man, I don't know nothing.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.651
What was you writing then?

40:46.820 --> 40:50.572
They talked about the man who got killed,
his kids - they asked me to write.

40:50.657 --> 40:54.159
- What you got to do with them?
- That's what I said.

40:54.244 --> 40:56.495
They cried about how
the kids ain't doing good.

40:56.579 --> 41:00.290
It ain't gonna hurt for me
to say I'm sorry the man got killed.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.751
Why the fuck you gotta say you sorry?

41:02.836 --> 41:05.420
Motherfuckers tried to put
your ass in the stir.

41:05.505 --> 41:07.631
Yeah, but it didn't turn out that way.

41:07.715 --> 41:11.009
You know, that's what I'm saying,
it's a shame that y'all...

41:13.471 --> 41:17.808
I'm saying, it's a shame
what happened to that man, all right?

41:17.892 --> 41:23.063
He didn't do nothing but come off the elevator
when I was doing that thing.

41:24.107 --> 41:26.358
What you think, cuz?

41:27.610 --> 41:28.902
About what?

41:28.987 --> 41:31.321
What you think about what happened
to the man?

41:31.406 --> 41:33.574
You think we killed the motherfucker?

41:35.994 --> 41:37.995
Speak your mind.

41:40.707 --> 41:43.500
- Man, I don't know.
- Exactly.

41:43.585 --> 41:45.502
And you don't need to know.

41:45.587 --> 41:48.922
And if we did, we had a reason.
And if we didn't, we had a reason.

41:49.007 --> 41:52.092
Either way, you ain't got shit to do with it.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.469
It ain't on you, cuz.

41:54.554 --> 41:56.597
You feel me? It ain't on you.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.808
Now, if you get jacked again,

41:59.893 --> 42:03.270
I don't want to hear shit
about you writing nothing to no one.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.689
- Got it?
- Yeah.

42:07.609 --> 42:09.401
Come on, let's have some good times

42:09.485 --> 42:12.738
and get some ribs
before they ate all the ribs up.

42:14.866 --> 42:17.618
- This case isn't shit, Carv.
- I know it.

42:17.702 --> 42:21.413
We're dancing around
with this motherfucker, typing shit out,

42:21.497 --> 42:23.707
taking pictures of assholes in hats.

42:23.791 --> 42:26.084
- What the fuck is that?
- It's bullshit.

42:26.169 --> 42:29.087
I say we go down there right now.
Right fucking now.

42:29.172 --> 42:32.132
We go into those towers,
and we let them know.

42:33.301 --> 42:34.593
I'm serious.

42:34.677 --> 42:37.846
You got to let these motherfuckers know
who you are.

42:39.140 --> 42:41.141
You coming?

42:42.143 --> 42:45.312
- I'm with you.
- Carv?

42:47.523 --> 42:49.233
What the hell?

42:49.317 --> 42:51.318
Let's do it.

42:55.949 --> 42:57.783
Come on.

43:10.255 --> 43:12.965
- Shut it down.
- Five-O.

43:13.174 --> 43:16.635
Five-O, five-O, break up.

43:35.655 --> 43:37.489
Come here, man. Where you going?

43:37.824 --> 43:40.409
Don't act like you don't know me.
Get your hands up.

43:40.493 --> 43:41.827
Put that down.

43:41.911 --> 43:45.706
- Drop it! Kiss the fucking ground!
- Put your hands up.

43:46.666 --> 43:48.917
Don't look at me like I ain't talking English.

43:49.002 --> 43:52.671
You got a needle on you?
Got anything in here that's gonna stick me?

43:52.922 --> 43:55.340
No? What's that?

43:56.217 --> 43:57.968
What you got in your pockets?

43:58.052 --> 44:00.095
You know what? Put your pants down, man.

44:00.179 --> 44:02.264
Pants down
and get down on the ground.

44:02.348 --> 44:04.349
Down on the fucking ground!

44:06.644 --> 44:09.479
All right, spread your shit out.

44:09.564 --> 44:12.399
- Nice shoes.
- Think a happy thought.

44:15.153 --> 44:18.238
Why don't you go somewhere else
with that bullshit?

44:20.616 --> 44:24.453
- No-good motherfuckers.
- Stay down, man, stay down.

44:24.537 --> 44:27.456
Y'all let Barksdale and them know
who owns these towers.

44:27.540 --> 44:28.957
'Cause we coming back.

44:29.042 --> 44:31.168
- I'm sick of this shit.
- Kiss my ass!

44:31.252 --> 44:34.338
We come back in an hour,
catch everybody dirty.

44:35.298 --> 44:37.341
- That's bullshit, man.
- Stay down, man.

44:37.425 --> 44:40.510
That's fucked up. Man ain't did nothing.

44:41.721 --> 44:44.306
Want something?

44:48.311 --> 44:51.104
- Move, shitbird.
- I ain't doing nothing.

44:53.775 --> 44:56.360
Really? I got nothing for you.

44:58.654 --> 45:02.407
- My eye, my eye.
- Who you gonna eyefuck now?

45:04.118 --> 45:06.370
- Aah!
- Are you serious?

45:06.454 --> 45:08.705
You bleed on my car?
Don't bleed on my car.

45:08.790 --> 45:11.333
Get your shit off my car.

45:17.298 --> 45:19.674
What the fuck's the matter with you?

45:40.071 --> 45:42.155
Got a visual?

45:42.824 --> 45:44.282
Fuck.

45:44.367 --> 45:46.368
Get the radio.

45:47.370 --> 45:50.497
1135, signal 13.

45:50.581 --> 45:53.333
771 Franklin, in the Court.

45:53.709 --> 45:55.168
Son of a bitch!

45:55.253 --> 45:58.088
Shots fired, officers need assistance.

45:59.549 --> 46:01.383
I'm hit! Signal 13.

46:01.467 --> 46:03.718
Officer down. Officer down!

46:11.227 --> 46:12.561
Shit!

46:32.874 --> 46:35.625
- Hello?
- 'You seen the paper?'

46:35.710 --> 46:38.420
- What?
- 'The newspaper, get it.'

46:56.355 --> 46:58.190
Hey, kids.

47:19.587 --> 47:21.588
Oh, no.

47:22.924 --> 47:24.841
'You happy now, bitch?'

47:27.178 --> 47:29.763
McNulty!

47:29.847 --> 47:32.265
- Where in fuck is he?
- Uh...

47:32.350 --> 47:35.101
He's detailed, Major, to Narcotics...

47:35.186 --> 47:38.355
I fucking know where he's detailed.
I already know that!

47:38.439 --> 47:39.564
Yes, sir.

47:39.649 --> 47:42.192
- Where is he right now?
- I can page him, sir.

47:47.156 --> 47:49.115
Move that fucking desk out of my unit.

47:49.200 --> 47:52.160
I do not want that
fucking man's desk in my unit.

47:52.245 --> 47:54.287
That's Crutchfield's desk.

47:56.707 --> 47:58.250
Crutchfield's?

47:58.334 --> 48:00.627
McNulty sits here.

48:07.468 --> 48:10.762
- What was that about?
- Did you see today's paper?

48:10.846 --> 48:13.974
- Just sports.
- You gotta check out the front page.

48:17.979 --> 48:19.896
Whoa!

48:19.981 --> 48:23.358
- What'll they do to him?
- Let me tell you something.

48:23.442 --> 48:26.903
If he gets caught with his dick up the ass
of the deputy's wife

48:26.988 --> 48:32.325
he's still gonna have more of a career
than if they find out he's behind that story.

48:53.347 --> 48:54.681
Lieutenant.

48:55.975 --> 49:00.520
I saw the story in the paper.
I want you to know I had nothing to do...

49:21.292 --> 49:24.669
- They jumped us, Boss.
- Who?

49:24.754 --> 49:26.296
Fucking project niggers.

49:26.380 --> 49:29.341
What are you doing here
at two in the morning?

49:30.718 --> 49:32.844
Field interviews, police work.

49:32.928 --> 49:35.639
- Police work?
- Yeah.

49:37.433 --> 49:41.645
I got a 14-year-old in critical
but stable condition at University,

49:41.729 --> 49:43.647
and two witnesses who say one of you

49:43.731 --> 49:46.441
- cold-cocked him with a pistol.
- No, sir.

49:46.525 --> 49:49.861
I got his mother over at IID
filing a brutality charge,

49:50.071 --> 49:52.656
which for Herc will make four
in the last two years.

49:52.740 --> 49:54.658
- None sustained.
- But all true.

49:54.742 --> 49:55.742
We thought that...

49:55.826 --> 49:58.495
I got one less Crown Vic than I had last night,

49:58.579 --> 50:01.247
I'm out two Kevlar vests
that burned in the car,

50:01.332 --> 50:03.583
two hand-held radios, a shotgun,

50:03.668 --> 50:07.337
and I'm about to lose this idiot here
for a week or two of medical.

50:07.421 --> 50:09.673
- And for what?
- Lieutenant...

50:09.757 --> 50:12.676
What did you learn when you went
at two in the morning

50:12.760 --> 50:14.719
to conduct field interviews?

50:14.804 --> 50:19.265
What valuable information
did we acquire from this situation?

50:21.268 --> 50:25.188
IID is gonna be on all three of you
by afternoon.

50:25.272 --> 50:27.732
If you don't get a story straight by then,

50:27.817 --> 50:32.278
you're gonna have a file thick enough
to see the light of a trial board.

50:33.364 --> 50:37.117
Now tell me, who cold-cocked the kid?

50:45.960 --> 50:47.627
Me.

50:50.631 --> 50:52.632
Why?

50:53.634 --> 50:55.844
He pissed me off.

50:58.806 --> 51:02.392
No, Officer Pryzbylewski,
he did not piss you off.

51:03.436 --> 51:07.564
He made you fear for your safety
and that of your fellow officers.

51:08.649 --> 51:10.650
I'm guessing now, but maybe...

51:10.735 --> 51:14.112
he was seen to pick up a bottle
and menace officers Hauk and Carver

51:14.196 --> 51:17.407
who had already sustained injury
from flying projectiles.

51:17.491 --> 51:20.285
Rather than use deadly force
in such a situation,

51:20.369 --> 51:24.664
maybe you elected to approach the youth,
ordering him to drop the bottle.

51:24.749 --> 51:27.500
Maybe when he raised the bottle,

51:27.585 --> 51:30.754
you used a Kel-Lite,
not the handle of your service weapon,

51:30.838 --> 51:33.298
to incapacitate the suspect.

51:35.551 --> 51:36.885
Go practice.

51:37.845 --> 51:40.722
You fuck the bullshit up
when you talk to Internal,

51:40.806 --> 51:43.308
I can't fix it, you're on your own.

51:51.817 --> 51:55.111
- Push the arraignments back to three.
- And the Gillette case?

51:55.196 --> 51:57.864
The Gillette trial goes back
on the move docket.

51:57.948 --> 52:00.784
Come on, walk with me. I'm running late.

52:03.370 --> 52:05.330
- It wasn't me.
- The story quoted you.

52:05.414 --> 52:08.458
Reporter has the story
when he calls me about the quote.

52:08.542 --> 52:13.630
Am I gonna say he wasn't a witness?
He didn't testify in my court last week?

52:13.714 --> 52:15.131
What?

52:15.216 --> 52:17.383
You don't think it's around
about the witness?

52:17.468 --> 52:20.470
Lawyers, clerks, jurors, everybody talks.

52:20.554 --> 52:24.224
- I'm in the shit here, Your Honor.
- What can I tell you?

52:24.308 --> 52:27.435
I called the deputy, not the newspapers.
I gotta run.

52:32.274 --> 52:36.152
- You should have hung them.
- If I hang them, I hang myself.

52:36.237 --> 52:38.404
I'm the man in charge, remember?

52:38.489 --> 52:41.574
Besides, you don't
give your people up to IID.

52:41.659 --> 52:43.326
You don't do that.

52:43.410 --> 52:46.412
Even if they put
a 14-year-old into critical care?

52:51.168 --> 52:53.503
This case, it's just...

52:53.587 --> 52:56.172
Get out of it.

52:56.257 --> 52:58.550
- How do I do that?
- I don't know.

52:58.634 --> 53:01.302
But you can't lose if you don't play.

53:02.388 --> 53:05.598
I always heard it
that you can't win if you don't play.

53:06.267 --> 53:08.685
The department puts you on a case
it doesn't want.

53:08.769 --> 53:11.688
You're given people
that are useless or untrustworthy.

53:11.772 --> 53:13.606
Correct.

53:13.691 --> 53:18.236
If you push too hard and any shit hits the fan,
you'll be blamed for it.

53:18.320 --> 53:19.529
Correct.

53:19.613 --> 53:23.867
If you don't push hard enough and there's
no arrest, you'll be blamed for that, too.

53:23.951 --> 53:25.368
Correct.

53:25.452 --> 53:27.745
The game is rigged.

53:27.830 --> 53:30.456
But you cannot lose if you do not play.

53:42.303 --> 53:44.846
- 'Sylvia!'
- 'Yes, Mickey?'

53:44.930 --> 53:47.640
'How do you call your lover boy?'

53:47.725 --> 53:49.559
'Come here, lover boy!'

53:49.643 --> 53:53.229
- 'And if he doesn't answer?'
- 'Oh, lover boy.'

53:53.314 --> 53:56.733
- 'And if he still doesn't answer?'
- 'I simply say...

53:56.817 --> 53:58.526
' Baby... '

54:15.210 --> 54:16.544
In the hole, y'all.

55:07.888 --> 55:13.935
' Baby, my sweet baby... '

55:22.486 --> 55:24.696
Hey!

55:24.780 --> 55:26.781
Hey, you fuckheads!

55:30.744 --> 55:32.453
Police!

56:01.650 --> 56:03.276
- Hello.
- 'Lieutenant Daniels?'

56:03.360 --> 56:04.694
Yeah.

56:15.289 --> 56:16.706
Who was that?

56:16.790 --> 56:20.168
It was the duty officer
down at University Hospital.

56:20.252 --> 56:22.170
What happened?

56:23.213 --> 56:25.715
- He's blind in one eye.
- Who?

56:27.259 --> 56:30.303
The kid. The 14-year-old.
