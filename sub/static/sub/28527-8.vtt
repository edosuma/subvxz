00:08.091 --> 00:11.052
[Mr. Boss] The greatest high in the world.
Perfect bliss in a bottle.

00:11.136 --> 00:14.681
Like how Matthew McConaughey feels
on the greatest night of his life,

00:14.764 --> 00:15.724
but you can snort it.

00:15.849 --> 00:19.269
Anyway, the way the twins
described this Utopium stuff of yours,

00:19.352 --> 00:20.562
it sounds amazing.

00:20.645 --> 00:21.896
It's getting there.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.315
I feel like the formula
still needs a bit of work, though.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.900
So, get to work.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.362
And change that shirt of yours
once in a while.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.322
People are starting to talk.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.245
And take it easy on that stuff.

00:37.871 --> 00:41.207
Quality control. It's part of the process.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.400
Hey, just boxed up the new batch.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.652
<i>You interested in giving it a spin?</i>

01:10.070 --> 01:11.821
<i>Yeah, pick me up.</i>

01:12.238 --> 01:14.532
[laughs]

01:17.952 --> 01:19.954
[man] Why're you still tinkering, man?

01:20.288 --> 01:23.792
That last batch was perfection.

01:25.084 --> 01:28.463
Methylenedioxyamphetamine level
was too low.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.966
I want the basal ganglia
firing on both cylinders,

01:32.050 --> 01:35.053
serotonin and dopamine,
cascading together.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.639
It's crazy it's that simple.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.312
Match the right chemicals
with the right brain parts,

01:44.687 --> 01:46.064
anything can happen.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.859
Anything...

01:53.780 --> 01:55.782
[muffled screaming]

01:56.157 --> 01:56.991
[doorbell rings]

01:59.828 --> 02:01.162
Martin Roberts?

02:01.246 --> 02:02.372
Yes.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.958
Uh...

02:05.041 --> 02:07.168
My name is Olivia Moore.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.003
I'm your daughter.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.554
This is unbelievable.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.764
Mom finally gave me your name.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.559
After that it was easy.
I work for the police department.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.894
You're a police officer?

02:24.978 --> 02:27.480
Assistant to
the medical examiner, actually.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.820
So your mom...
I imagine she told you some stories.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.322
Well, she did tell me some.

02:36.406 --> 02:41.327
Well, that was a long time ago.
I'm sober now, and...

02:41.411 --> 02:43.580
-[cell phone buzzes]
-Sorry.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.669
Sorry, uh... Work. I have to go.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.881
But maybe we could

02:53.298 --> 02:55.216
get together? Get a coffee, or--

02:55.300 --> 02:57.135
Yes, I'd love that.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.679
Well, here's my card, so...

03:00.597 --> 03:02.807
Okay, sorry, I have to go.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.436
Liv,

03:08.146 --> 03:09.480
I'm glad you found me.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.858
Yeah.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.807
I could tell when he opened the door.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.310
Right off the bat, his eyes.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.563
Evan's eyes. It's him. It's my dad.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.815
Man, that's a lot.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.321
I've done it.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.574
Best grilled cheese the world's ever seen.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.911
-[scoffs]
-Cheddar and jack, melted to perfection

04:04.994 --> 04:08.498
on sourdough toasted a sexy golden brown.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.501
And what better to nestle in
amongst all that cheese

04:11.584 --> 04:14.045
than the cheesiest of brains,
car salesman?

04:14.128 --> 04:15.463
-Car salesman?
-Yeah.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.674
Tell me that's not Rick Randall's brain
in there.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.426
Rick Randall?
Drove off the Fremont Bridge?

04:20.510 --> 04:21.344
The suicide?

04:21.427 --> 04:24.013
Now Rick Randall the murder victim.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.558
This was the message
he left on his wife's phone

04:27.642 --> 04:29.269
before he went into the lake.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.187
[Rick] <i>Gina! My car's out of control!</i>

04:31.271 --> 04:32.563
<i>It's steering itself!</i>

04:32.647 --> 04:34.023
<i>I can't stop! Call someone!</i>

04:34.399 --> 04:35.608
[screaming]<i> Oh, God!</i>

04:36.985 --> 04:38.027
That can happen?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.904
Uh-huh. Cars can be possessed.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.073
-Herbie, for example.
-Herbie wasn't possessed.

04:42.156 --> 04:43.408
You're thinking of Christine.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.159
Herbie wasn't evil.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.828
He was the Love Bug.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.454
All right. Focus up.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.291
Rick drove a Malevex 6.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.959
Comes with a self-drive setting.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.795
It's possible someone accessed
the system from the outside.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.505
Vampire Steve's checking.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.173
So save some of that brain for Liv.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.467
Oh, and, before I forget...

05:02.677 --> 05:04.345
Annual raffle time.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.222
-[sighs] Oh!
-It's a buck each.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.140
You know the drill,

05:07.223 --> 05:10.059
everyone in the department
sells at least 50 tickets.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.646
No complaints. It's for a good cause.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.399
You know everyone just buys
their own tickets, right?

05:16.482 --> 05:18.026
I don't care as long as we meet our quota.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.485
What's the prize this year?

05:19.569 --> 05:22.613
Margo Ball Motors donated
a souped-up '67 Mustang.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.324
Not really a car person.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.825
Then don't buy a ticket.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.452
What's the prize
for whoever sells the most tickets?

05:27.535 --> 05:28.369
A mountain bike.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.246
The mountains are on
the other side of the wall.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.790
Then don't win the contest.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.668
Ooh...

05:51.893 --> 05:52.852
Check it out.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.229
Now, this was the world's best
grilled cheese.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.900
Cute. Meanwhile, I sold 60 raffle tickets.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.777
Sixty? We only got 50.

06:00.860 --> 06:04.530
I sold ten of yours, too.
Which makes me current sales leader.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.240
I haven't started. You cheated!

06:06.324 --> 06:07.366
I've heard that before.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.870
Oh, that's right, it's the first line
of the Loser National Anthem.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.872
I'm off to get more tickets
to win this thing.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.166
Make yourself useful.
Answer the phones or something.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.669
Dream on.
I am ten times the salesman you are.

06:18.753 --> 06:22.507
I just like to start from behind,
so it hurts worse when I blow past you.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.050
Bring it on, blondie.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.136
I'll probably solve this case
before you, too. Laters.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.848
Well, I hope you like "Blue Bayou,"
'cause that's my theme song!

06:30.932 --> 06:32.016
[kisses]

06:32.433 --> 06:35.353
Were you aware of anyone
who had anything against Rick?

06:35.436 --> 06:38.231
Family, friends, maybe a rival at work?

06:38.314 --> 06:40.316
They were all rivals at that place.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.943
God, the testosterone...

06:42.235 --> 06:43.653
All trying to be alpha dog...

06:43.736 --> 06:45.822
Backstabbers, every one of them.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.157
So...

06:48.908 --> 06:51.661
What's the sitch, Clive?
We got a live one?

06:51.744 --> 06:55.081
Liv, this is Mrs. Randall,
widow of the deceased.

06:55.456 --> 06:56.624
I'm up to speed.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.793
So, who wanted him dead?

06:59.252 --> 07:01.879
I think we can get that SOB
the death penalty.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.340
Don't like the death penalty? What about

07:04.590 --> 07:06.050
life behind bars?

07:06.134 --> 07:07.385
-Liv...
-Picture it.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.179
-The widow?
-The widow.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.642
Mrs. Randall.

07:15.059 --> 07:15.977
Isn't it true you recently purchased

07:16.060 --> 07:18.563
a substantial life insurance policy
for your husband?

07:18.646 --> 07:19.480
Ravi!

07:19.939 --> 07:24.235
We upgraded our policy a couple years ago
after Rick got a promotion.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.112
You two...

07:33.077 --> 07:34.495
Give us a minute, please.

07:39.041 --> 07:39.917
Ravi.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.421
What was that about life insurance?
Where did you--

07:43.504 --> 07:47.175
Babs, who taught me
it's always the spouse?

07:47.508 --> 07:48.634
You.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.387
I trusted my gut.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.431
Paid off. Up top.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.269
You're not a detective. Stay out--

07:58.352 --> 07:59.270
She's not a detective.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.354
But I'm a closer.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.522
Let's head back in there
and I'll break her.

08:01.606 --> 08:02.857
Now that I've loosened the lid.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.567
Lieutenant.

08:05.651 --> 08:06.819
Acting lieutenant.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.821
I was able to look over
the systems of that Malevex.

08:08.905 --> 08:12.575
Long story short,
the self-drive was hacked from outside.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.285
Who could do that?

08:14.452 --> 08:16.078
A hacker. A good one.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.915
Or anyone with access
to the factory settings on the car.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.084
-So, like, anyone at the dealership?
-Yeah.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.254
I'll call the general manager,
see who all had access.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.840
Can you, like, put a trace on the hack?

08:27.924 --> 08:31.511
If you mean trace the command codes
back to the source IP, maybe.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.846
But whoever did this
covered their tracks rather nicely.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.765
I may need the host computer to verify.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.767
Excellent work, Steve.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.436
I would say that warrants
a special deal on raffle tickets.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.729
I'll go ten for ten bucks.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.899
That's not a special deal.
That's just what they cost.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.609
Straight talk.
Twenty tickets for a Jackson.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.487
-[scoffs]
-Come on.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.114
-Whatever. I'm sold out anyway.
-Me, too.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.658
-I'll take 20.
-Forty.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.078
[sighs in exasperation]

08:58.204 --> 08:59.330
Blaine?

09:01.457 --> 09:06.003
What... What did you do?

09:06.087 --> 09:09.298
The deposit on my Freylich girl's brain
went through.

09:09.674 --> 09:13.678
No offense, but when it comes to tables,
I prefer Noguchi to ping-pong.

09:14.178 --> 09:17.223
Mom E doesn't let us
have food or drinks down here.

09:17.640 --> 09:22.728
She made this for me herself
after I got her the new washer and dryer.

09:23.187 --> 09:26.357
Whisper quiet, unlike her son.

09:27.441 --> 09:31.404
Anyway. I need you to find our old friend
Dalton Earl Duke.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.239
I have a business proposition for him.

09:33.698 --> 09:34.949
You called me here just for that?

09:35.032 --> 09:36.617
Of course not.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.703
I thought we could catch up.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.872
We hardly get any quality time anymore.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.125
What happened to us?

09:44.875 --> 09:47.837
I have a bar to run. By myself.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.590
Yeah. How is the old Scratching Post?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.174
You mean, Don E Be Goodz?

09:53.884 --> 09:55.970
I get you're laying low,

09:56.596 --> 09:58.097
but you could still help out in the back.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.807
By doing what?

10:00.224 --> 10:01.642
Invoices?

10:01.892 --> 10:02.977
For instance.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.730
At least just consider it.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.231
Considered. No.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.983
Okay, good catch-up. Now go.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.443
Don E, go.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.279
Oh!

10:13.362 --> 10:14.614
And tell Mom E...

10:16.657 --> 10:17.825
I'm ready for a refill.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.834
Corporal Jones.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.213
It says here you have flu symptoms.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.925
It feels like I got hit by a truck.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.260
Let me take a look.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.680
I don't believe I've seen you before.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.232
Congratulations, Doc. You're a zombie now.

10:52.818 --> 10:56.072
If you wanna survive,
you need to do exactly what I say.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.247
Welcome back, darling.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.957
Congrats on arranging the summit.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.460
Ambassadors and Senators
and generals, oh, my.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.045
Well, don't congratulate me yet.

11:11.128 --> 11:12.630
They agreed to come hear us out,

11:12.713 --> 11:16.050
see for themselves that zombies
aren't slaughtering humans in the streets.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.928
If they don't buy into Major's plan
they might just nuke us anyway.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.223
It's gonna go great.

11:22.306 --> 11:26.352
All right? You're smart,
you're focused and sexy.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.815
But you know,
if we might get nuked at any minute,

11:31.107 --> 11:33.234
wouldn't you like
to sail into the hereafter

11:33.317 --> 11:34.902
behind the wheel of a classic American--

11:34.985 --> 11:36.404
I already bought tickets from Liv.

11:37.738 --> 11:38.989
-Did you?
-Yeah.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.703
So, what're the chances
you reach an actual agreement

11:44.787 --> 11:46.539
with our friends in the US government?

11:46.956 --> 11:48.040
Slim.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.419
One of the generals has a daughter
stuck here in Seattle.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.380
He wants to see her,
and we can't find her.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.548
Not good.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.384
We'll still keep trying, but--

11:58.467 --> 12:01.595
It's time! <i>Hi, Zombie!</i>
dropped 40 seconds ago.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.765
Thank you.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.728
[Major] So, how nervous
is the executive producer right now?

12:09.812 --> 12:13.149
Well, since she's bet
her entire career on its success. Very.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.567
-There it is!
-Oh.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.735
Okay.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.404
Here goes nothing.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.656
[doorbell rings on TV]

12:20.739 --> 12:22.575
<i>Come on, Ed, it's just dinner.</i>

12:22.658 --> 12:24.493
<i>They're the new neighbors,</i>
<i>we're being polite.</i>

12:24.577 --> 12:26.078
<i>I know, it's just, every morning,</i>

12:26.162 --> 12:29.874
<i>I go out to get the paper and Jeff waves</i>
<i>at me and goes, "Hi, zombie!"</i>

12:30.207 --> 12:31.584
<i>-Ed, you are a zombie.</i>
-[man on TV]<i> Hello?</i>

12:31.667 --> 12:33.294
<i>But you don't just say that!</i>

12:33.377 --> 12:36.547
<i>Do I go up to Mrs. Maccani</i>
<i>and shout "Hi, Italian"?</i>

12:36.630 --> 12:38.007
<i>Or when my boss gives me a deadline</i>

12:38.090 --> 12:40.009
<i>am I like, "You got it, black guy!"</i>

12:40.092 --> 12:42.720
<i>-Or when Mrs. Chan--</i>
<i>-Don't be so sensitive, Ed.</i>

12:47.391 --> 12:48.601
[both] <i>Hi, zombies!</i>

12:49.894 --> 12:51.645
[girl on TV] <i>Hi... humans.</i>

12:57.026 --> 12:58.277
[guard] All right, hold up the traffic.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.294
[guard] It'll just be a few minutes,
ma'am. Thank you.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.425
[Major] A free zombie state,

13:21.509 --> 13:24.136
located on a remote island
in the Puget Sound.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.347
My predecessor, Vivian Stoll,

13:26.430 --> 13:29.725
was preparing it for the 300 zombies
she knew existed at the time.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.062
Now we're looking to relocate
all 10,000 zombies to this--

13:33.145 --> 13:34.647
Zombie Island?

13:35.314 --> 13:39.527
It's ambitious,
but we believe this is our best solution.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.695
Short of a cure,
which we're all working on.

13:41.779 --> 13:45.616
You want me to ask voters
to spend their tax dollars

13:45.699 --> 13:48.244
on dead people instead of live ones?

13:48.327 --> 13:49.245
Senator.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.163
He wants you to ask voters
to save the planet.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.249
I understand your concerns.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.085
But I believe
if we work together in good faith,

13:56.168 --> 13:59.463
we can find a way forward
toward a more peaceful tomorrow.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.302
Nootropics, huh?

14:05.761 --> 14:08.389
I take these,
and I'm like the <i>Limitless</i> guy?

14:08.472 --> 14:09.723
Steroids for your mind.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.810
Your brain'll be kicking sand
in the face of all the weakling brains

14:12.893 --> 14:14.603
down at Brain Beach.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.982
They said you'd gone legit,

14:18.065 --> 14:20.025
but this seems like
a pretty nice little scam.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.112
It works. I get string theory now.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.239
You can take a free sample, you'll see.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.156
And the money?

14:26.240 --> 14:28.200
Same as when I was
in the gourmet brain business,

14:28.284 --> 14:30.578
just now I run with thought leaders
and entrepreneurs

14:30.661 --> 14:32.830
instead of goons and killers.

14:33.205 --> 14:36.834
I don't really miss
the smuggling business.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.252
Mmm.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.921
-So, what'd you wanna talk about?
-Smuggling.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.298
[scoffs]

14:42.381 --> 14:45.634
I need to talk to your old associates
in the black market brain biz.

14:45.718 --> 14:49.638
I think I can offer something that
thought leaders and entrepreneurs can't.

14:50.639 --> 14:54.602
Maybe your jacked-up brain
can wrap itself around this number.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.526
I'll make a few calls.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.864
Beanpole?

15:10.367 --> 15:13.454
Beanpole, where you at, man?
We gotta move this stuff.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.211
Come on, you junkie,
where'd you go off to now?

15:21.295 --> 15:24.632
[Blaine] Scott E, get a move on, dude,
we're ready to roll out here!

15:24.715 --> 15:26.842
I'm coming. Keep your pants on!

15:29.178 --> 15:31.096
I'm surrounded by idiots.

15:32.222 --> 15:35.392
...and so he says to him,
"My man, I'm glad you got a good price,

15:35.476 --> 15:37.394
but those are not Ted Baker boots."

15:37.478 --> 15:38.687
[laughs]

15:38.771 --> 15:40.439
Man, so they weren't boots?

15:40.522 --> 15:42.316
Dude, calm down.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.860
What? He just told a story.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.739
Whatever, we got drugs to sell,
fresh from the oven, let's go.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.741
So, you heading to Nine Trolls?

15:51.116 --> 15:52.952
Julien's got the skate-park covered.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.163
Max Rager is throwing
a little soiree on the company yacht.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.539
Think I'll swing by.

15:57.831 --> 16:00.209
Dude, why not just say "boat party"
like a regular human?

16:00.292 --> 16:01.418
Ah...

16:01.502 --> 16:04.088
Because it's a soiree, Scott E.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.680
I don't see why you like that guy.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.057
What? He's fun.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.394
[Ravi] <i>Utopium. A certain batch.</i>

16:18.477 --> 16:22.231
Just anything relating
to a drug chemist called Beanpole Bob.

16:22.314 --> 16:25.317
Any references between 2014 and 2015.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.491
Great, thank you, Sergeant. Bye-bye.

16:33.575 --> 16:34.994
Hiding behind phones

16:35.077 --> 16:38.330
while I'm pressing flesh
and closing suckers?

16:38.706 --> 16:41.625
Not how you win the sales game, my friend.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.253
That was Clive's friend in Vice,

16:44.336 --> 16:46.714
whom I've enlisted in my search
for that Beanpole Bob guy

16:46.797 --> 16:48.632
and potentially a zombie cure.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.636
Now I'll turn to the CDC's list
of Freylich kids Charli sent me,

16:52.720 --> 16:57.891
which shows one kid here in Seattle,
whose life I'll now help safeguard.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.394
So you really want
to go head-to-head with Renegade?

17:00.477 --> 17:03.355
The Renegade in the saving lives area?

17:04.356 --> 17:06.525
I saved more people
than that before breakfast.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.193
[yawns]

17:11.572 --> 17:14.074
-Oh, hi.
-Hi. Sorry I'm a bit early.

17:14.158 --> 17:17.453
It's fine. Ravi, this is Martin Roberts.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.873
Right. Martin Roberts...

17:20.956 --> 17:22.666
Yep. Deadbeat dad.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.878
About to make up for a 30-year absence
with one hot dog.

17:27.004 --> 17:27.880
Wish me luck.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.631
Good luck.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.764
[clears throat]

17:41.101 --> 17:42.227
[woman] <i>Hello.</i>

17:42.311 --> 17:46.648
Hi, yes,
I'd like to speak to a Ms. Darcy Bennet?

17:46.732 --> 17:50.152
My name is Ravi Chakrabarti
and I need to speak to her about--

17:50.819 --> 17:52.321
-Dropped out?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

17:53.030 --> 17:54.364
-When?
<i>-Uh...</i>

17:56.408 --> 17:59.661
[Martin] After rehab,
I didn't have a ton of options.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.747
Mom said that you traveled the globe

18:01.830 --> 18:03.457
working for Doctors Without Borders?

18:04.291 --> 18:07.503
Yeah. That was tough. You see things.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.421
But for your soul?

18:09.880 --> 18:11.131
I don't know.

18:11.215 --> 18:14.343
Maybe a little pride
in doing something for the greater good.

18:14.426 --> 18:18.180
But there was so much death,
so much suffering,

18:18.263 --> 18:21.225
that I'm sure
I'll always be haunted by it.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.768
[sniffs]

18:23.143 --> 18:24.269
Are you all right?

18:25.646 --> 18:27.231
Oh, it's seasonal, you know.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.819
So, you're a zombie.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.029
-You can tell.
-Yes.

18:34.404 --> 18:35.823
Out and proud.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.617
I admire that.

18:41.245 --> 18:44.123
-What can I get you?
-Oh, extra peppers and hot sauce, please.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.624
Make that two.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.795
You're a zombie, too.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.422
How did you get turned?

18:52.506 --> 18:55.134
Aleutian flu shot, you?

18:55.509 --> 18:58.512
I'm an OZ, I got scratched
at the Max Rager boat party.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.264
[vendor] Here you go.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.689
Oh!

19:17.990 --> 19:19.992
So, when's the last time you used, Martin?

19:21.743 --> 19:26.081
Congestion, flush, manual tremors?
I'm a doctor. I know the signs.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.709
You're still on Utopium.

19:37.885 --> 19:42.306
I know it must be disappointing
to learn your father is an addict.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.558
No. This is on me.
Mom told me what you were,

19:44.641 --> 19:46.351
and I tracked you down, anyway.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.103
I don't know what I was expecting.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.605
She'd be loving this.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.356
But the thing of it is, Liv,

19:51.440 --> 19:55.485
when I saw you at the door,
I don't know, it was like...

19:55.986 --> 19:57.946
-You were the reason I needed.
-The reason?

19:58.030 --> 20:01.950
Yes. The reason I needed to kick,
once and for all.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.245
I don't think
I have anything left to give, Martin.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.207
And if I wasn't a reason when I was born,

20:08.540 --> 20:09.750
why would I be one now?

20:10.542 --> 20:11.710
I have to go to work.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.421
Take care of yourself.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.049
[footsteps retreating]

20:20.219 --> 20:22.429
Okay, if you all follow me,
we have lunch waiting,

20:22.512 --> 20:24.890
and we can prepare
for the afternoon session.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.269
[indistinct chatter]

20:39.321 --> 20:42.282
Lillywhite, I thought we agreed
my daughter would be here.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.785
I hoped she would, General.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.788
But she chose not to come,
for her own reasons.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.957
You know what this is, don't you?

20:50.582 --> 20:52.000
It's a difficult situation.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.710
It's a hostage situation.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.839
You zombies are terrorists
holding a half million humans hostage

20:57.923 --> 20:59.216
until you get what you want.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.260
I don't even know why we're here.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.096
The US government doesn't negotiate
with terrorists.

21:04.638 --> 21:08.225
I've been biting my tongue a long time,
but, now?

21:08.809 --> 21:11.436
Now that you couldn't produce my daughter?

21:12.562 --> 21:16.358
I'm going to walk through
the rubble of Seattle.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.406
I believe there are sandwiches
and drinks available in the commissary.

21:27.786 --> 21:31.248
[sighs] I turned back, and he was just
standing there, looking so forlorn.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.000
He could've gotten in
when the getting was good.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.501
Them's the breaks.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.714
[all chattering indistinctly]

21:42.718 --> 21:45.053
Yeah. It's bad. Real bad.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.097
We got the general manager in there.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.348
Right.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.933
[breathes deeply]

21:50.017 --> 21:51.685
Let's rip his face off.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.979
Ravi. No. I told you--

21:54.062 --> 21:55.397
Clive, what do you want
to do with this case?

21:55.689 --> 21:56.690
I want to close it.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.860
But not in the way you're thinking,
so just, no.

21:59.943 --> 22:01.028
Come on, Liv.

22:07.951 --> 22:11.788
So Mr. Fischer, I understand
the Malevex 6 comes with a self-drive?

22:11.872 --> 22:15.625
Amazing vehicle. The auto-pilot mode
is one of its many incredible features.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.711
You could drive it to New York City
without lifting a finger.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.671
You're not gonna hook this brick,
green pea.

22:19.796 --> 22:20.881
[chuckles]

22:20.964 --> 22:22.215
Never say never.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.094
The auto-drive comes with factory presets,
correct?

22:26.678 --> 22:28.805
Anyone with those
could access the auto-drive?

22:29.014 --> 22:30.390
Well, I mean, conceivably.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.892
You have access to the presets?

22:31.975 --> 22:34.061
Yeah, but I'm not gonna
off my best salesman.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.146
Rick Randall was a closing machine.

22:36.229 --> 22:38.315
He won the annual sales competition
five years running.

22:38.398 --> 22:39.733
Annual sales competition?

22:39.816 --> 22:41.693
First place gets a Malevex 6,

22:41.777 --> 22:43.487
second place gets a set of steak knives,

22:43.570 --> 22:45.572
-last place a pink slip.
-Ooh.

22:45.655 --> 22:47.407
-Fired?
-Rick always won.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.117
It drove Stu Solano crazy.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.037
-Who's Stu Solano?
-Second place, five years running.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.663
Guy's got a lot of steak knives.

22:53.747 --> 22:54.956
Let me guess. Bitter?

22:55.040 --> 22:57.459
He's bitter, all right.
Rick stole Gina from him.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.461
Rick's wife used to go out with Stu?

22:59.544 --> 23:00.921
Mmm-hmm.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.798
-She didn't mention that.
-I get it.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.175
Why spread around
you were with a second place nobody?

23:05.258 --> 23:07.511
Stu's good,
he just lacks a killer instinct.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.262
Sales is a blood sport.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.264
It sure is.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.352
Rick cheated.

23:15.977 --> 23:19.314
Bribed the desk for leads.
Stole them from the other salesmen.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.192
I played to win but I played fair.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.778
Far as I'm concerned, I won.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.530
With the steak knives to prove it.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.616
When Rick married your ex, Gina,

23:29.699 --> 23:30.909
were you cool with that?

23:30.992 --> 23:32.202
Gina?

23:33.203 --> 23:34.955
She was more of a demo for me.

23:35.038 --> 23:35.956
You know?

23:36.706 --> 23:38.834
You want a guy with motive?

23:39.167 --> 23:40.752
Take a look at Teddy Fischer.

23:41.044 --> 23:44.840
Rick was gunning for Teddy's job
and everybody knew.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.341
Especially Teddy.

23:51.888 --> 23:54.391
[Rick] The best loser there is!
Bon voyage, Jack!

23:54.474 --> 23:55.433
Are you a winner, Rick?

23:55.517 --> 23:56.935
Or should I ask your wife?

23:57.686 --> 23:59.187
[gasps]

24:00.147 --> 24:01.189
Who's Jack?

24:01.606 --> 24:04.734
Jack Klein? Used to work for Margo Ball.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.446
Got old, got slow, got fired last year.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.701
Sales, man. It's a blood sport.

24:14.619 --> 24:17.080
Gentlemen, thanks for coming.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.459
What I have for you is an invitation
to join a business venture.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.588
This is not unlike the brain smuggling
you've done in the past,

24:24.671 --> 24:29.176
only now the owner of the brain
will remain attached and alive.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.011
So it's basically the same deal.

24:31.094 --> 24:34.139
And the financial terms will reflect

24:34.222 --> 24:37.142
this increase
in the unit weight transported.

24:38.435 --> 24:41.563
You are each receiving a name
and an address

24:42.230 --> 24:44.566
on the items you will be transporting.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.861
You bring 'em in, you get paid,
you go get another.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.655
Bergman Hall School for Girls?

24:51.990 --> 24:52.991
Is this a kid?

24:53.950 --> 24:55.035
They all are.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.120
Or rather, teens,

24:57.204 --> 25:00.040
who, let's be honest, are the worst.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.670
So, you may need
to come up a little on the fee.

25:05.795 --> 25:07.839
I already gave 'em the bump
for the extra weight.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.799
You didn't mention they were kids.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.510
Teens. Who,
other than the random passage of time,

25:12.594 --> 25:13.970
are basically adults.

25:14.387 --> 25:15.597
Why do they care?

25:15.889 --> 25:18.266
Well, it's... It's a moral issue.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.101
These guys?

25:20.185 --> 25:21.478
Give me a second.

25:26.983 --> 25:30.278
Okay, an extra $15,000 a head?

25:30.362 --> 25:31.738
To cover the moral issue.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.073
-Five.
-Thirteen.

25:33.156 --> 25:33.990
Ten.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.494
Okay, then.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.496
Let's go round up some rugrats.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.207
Huh? [laughs]

25:47.254 --> 25:48.797
Clive, let me ask you a question.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.215
You were in Vice.

25:50.632 --> 25:53.343
How many people
who've been heavily-addicted for 30 years

25:53.718 --> 25:55.220
turn themselves around?

25:55.303 --> 25:56.680
Hmm. I know it happens.

25:57.013 --> 25:58.139
That's good.

25:58.598 --> 26:00.100
I've never seen it, though.

26:04.604 --> 26:07.774
Hi. Seattle PD.
We're looking for Jack Klein.

26:07.857 --> 26:08.984
What for?

26:09.067 --> 26:10.652
I'm Jack. How can I help you?

26:10.735 --> 26:13.530
We wanted to ask some questions
about the death of Rick Randall.

26:13.780 --> 26:15.031
Like, how great it was, or...

26:15.490 --> 26:16.950
Emily, honey...

26:17.325 --> 26:18.368
Whatever. I'm late.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.370
Call me if your practice runs late!

26:20.453 --> 26:22.831
Dad, I'll text you,
'cause it's not 2003, okay?

26:22.914 --> 26:24.082
[chuckles]

26:24.165 --> 26:25.417
Come on in.

26:29.504 --> 26:33.675
Yeah, I worked at Margo Ball for,
what, 23 years.

26:34.301 --> 26:37.220
Must've hurt when they fired you
after all those years of service.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.222
That whole place was toxic.

26:39.681 --> 26:42.851
I mean, I feel sorry
for those miserable jerks.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.103
Emily transferred back from USC,

26:45.186 --> 26:47.689
so I get to see her a lot more
than I used to.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.066
Get to see some of her field hockey games.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.068
Plus, the coffee's much better at home.

26:52.319 --> 26:53.778
[laughs]

26:54.738 --> 26:56.323
I'm much happier here.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.409
We looked over the sales numbers.

26:59.492 --> 27:03.580
Looks like you slipped into last
after Rick closed a deal you originated.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.041
-Were you aware of that?
-So what if he did.

27:06.666 --> 27:09.461
What do they always say over there?
Sales is a--

27:09.544 --> 27:10.420
Blood sport.

27:10.879 --> 27:11.713
Right.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.631
A witness said he heard you suggest

27:13.715 --> 27:17.093
Rick should ask his wife something
the day you were fired.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.303
What did you mean?

27:18.386 --> 27:19.846
Not my finest moment.

27:19.929 --> 27:20.889
What'd you mean?

27:21.723 --> 27:23.850
Get this. Rick's wife, Gina,

27:23.933 --> 27:26.144
she used to go around with Stu Solano.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.562
-We're aware.
-Yeah.

27:27.645 --> 27:31.608
But did you know that all along
she was two-timing with Teddy?

27:33.068 --> 27:35.779
Teddy Fischer? The general manager?

27:35.862 --> 27:38.490
See what I mean? Place is a snake pit.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.118
<i>Don't tell me I'm raging out!</i>
<i>I'm not raging out!</i>

27:42.202 --> 27:43.828
<i>Your eyes are a little red, Ed.</i>

27:44.287 --> 27:46.164
<i>I went swimming! It's from the chlorine.</i>

27:46.623 --> 27:48.041
<i>You're darn right I'm furious!</i>

27:48.124 --> 27:51.044
<i>But not because I'm a zombie!</i>
<i>It's because you're an idiot!</i>

27:51.127 --> 27:52.796
Peak TV my ass.

27:54.422 --> 27:56.174
There's my girl!

27:57.175 --> 27:59.052
Sorry to send in the heavy like this,

27:59.135 --> 28:01.012
it's just, when I heard
people were looking for you,

28:01.096 --> 28:03.223
I got a little worried
that my investment might be at risk.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.059
Carl. You can go.

28:08.395 --> 28:12.482
So, any idea
who our mystery caller might be?

28:13.233 --> 28:14.359
My roommate took the call.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.737
Said his name was, like,
Ralphie Sharkbuddy, or something?

28:18.863 --> 28:20.448
And he was putting on
a fake British accent.

28:20.698 --> 28:21.991
[chuckles]

28:22.075 --> 28:23.410
I know him actually.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.078
Accent's real.

28:25.370 --> 28:29.249
[sighs] He wants your brain for science,
so I'd definitely steer clear.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.836
It's probably best
that you just lay low for a while.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.003
Lay low?

28:35.004 --> 28:36.131
In here?

28:36.214 --> 28:37.048
Yup.

28:37.132 --> 28:40.802
I mean, being bored out of my mind
is not on my bucket list.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.012
Okay.

28:43.304 --> 28:47.016
There are other places we can stash you
that are a bit more lively.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.769
Have you been to The Scratching Post?

28:51.479 --> 28:53.732
I think we should get Gina
and Teddy back in here.

28:54.023 --> 28:55.442
If they were having an affair,

28:55.525 --> 28:57.527
and he knew Rick was gunning for his job,

28:57.610 --> 28:58.820
they could've worked together.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.281
I dunno. I say
there's something off about that Jack guy.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.408
Liv, the man still owns a flip phone.

29:03.491 --> 29:04.868
You think he can hack a Malevex?

29:06.202 --> 29:08.288
Clive. Liv.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.833
Ravi, whatever sales nonsense this is,
I'm just in no mood.

29:12.709 --> 29:13.960
I've had a vision.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.630
Rick walks out to his car,

29:17.714 --> 29:19.591
finds his windscreen smashed...

29:19.966 --> 29:20.800
That's it?

29:21.176 --> 29:22.302
You call that a vision?

29:22.385 --> 29:24.929
...and the words "Die Pig"
spray-painted on his hood!

29:25.346 --> 29:27.891
I don't suppose you saw
who smashed his window and tagged his car.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.102
Yeah, you never do.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.355
I'll see if his insurance company
has any photos.

29:34.439 --> 29:35.690
Boom. That easy.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.151
Oh, and if you've got
a few more raffle tickets...

29:38.234 --> 29:39.486
Actually, me too.

29:39.569 --> 29:40.779
Twice whatever you're giving him.

29:40.862 --> 29:44.324
No. No, no, no, no, no. No more tickets!

29:44.407 --> 29:45.992
Just, no. No.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.499
Uh-uh-uh!

29:54.918 --> 29:56.461
Coffee is for closers.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.546
[gasps]

29:58.630 --> 30:00.048
Vice'll have more tickets.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.475
Burrito Monday is officially canceled.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.234
This sucks!

30:19.859 --> 30:22.946
Owning a bar is supposed to be fun.

30:23.029 --> 30:25.615
I shouldn't be doing grunt work.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.409
God!

30:29.577 --> 30:32.205
My life is the worst!

30:32.330 --> 30:33.540
We could switch.

30:33.623 --> 30:36.084
I'll run the bar,
and you can be the zombie prostitute?

30:36.292 --> 30:37.210
And what the hell?

30:37.293 --> 30:41.005
I thought we had a strict
"no love songs on the jukebox" policy.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.633
-Who put this on?
-[Darcy] I did.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.353
It happens to be my jam.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.195
What, you don't like music?

31:04.445 --> 31:07.824
I just think this song is a little cheesy.

31:08.491 --> 31:10.243
Says the guy wearing that shirt.

31:11.494 --> 31:14.205
What? No, it's...

31:15.957 --> 31:17.083
bold.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.044
-Could I get a beer?
-Could I see some ID?

31:20.128 --> 31:21.588
Nope. I got this!

31:26.843 --> 31:27.844
It's on the house.

31:32.849 --> 31:34.767
No frickin' way!

31:36.728 --> 31:38.605
Candy! Candy!

31:39.564 --> 31:40.899
That's the girl

31:41.274 --> 31:43.651
the matchmaker told me about. My soulmate.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.403
She's out of my league, isn't she?

31:45.486 --> 31:46.946
Oh, yeah. Way out.

31:48.615 --> 31:51.826
But also, that's Blaine's Freylich girl.

31:52.952 --> 31:54.829
Fatal brain disease.
She's gonna be dead any minute.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.832
So, well,

31:59.083 --> 32:00.543
sorry, I guess.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.048
-[exhales]
-Turns out our dead guy Rick

32:05.548 --> 32:08.551
did make an insurance claim
after his car was vandalized.

32:08.635 --> 32:09.886
Yeah, he did.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.472
Here's what's interesting.
These holes, here.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.975
Whoever smashed it
used something with a rounded end

32:16.059 --> 32:17.393
that punched through the glass.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.020
-Like a baseball bat?
-Or a golf club?

32:19.520 --> 32:22.857
Could be, could be, or...

32:23.858 --> 32:25.360
A field hockey stick.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.319
Jack's daughter?

32:26.402 --> 32:27.278
Emily Klein.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.281
Remember how happy she was
that Rick was dead?

32:30.365 --> 32:32.617
She didn't strike me
as a girl with a dragon tattoo.

32:32.992 --> 32:33.952
That so?

32:35.662 --> 32:38.623
She happens to be
a computer science major at USC.

32:39.207 --> 32:42.669
Expelled last year for hacking a blimp
during homecoming week

32:42.752 --> 32:44.837
and programming it
to display lewd comments

32:44.921 --> 32:47.256
about her ex during the UCLA game.

32:47.715 --> 32:49.175
Now if you'll excuse me,

32:52.053 --> 32:55.682
the closer is heading out
to make his collar.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.312
This is the best part of my job.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.528
Okay, so I smashed up
his precious Malevex.

33:08.736 --> 33:12.073
The guy ruined my dad's life,
and I had to drop out of USC.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.449
That doesn't mean I killed him.

33:13.866 --> 33:16.160
Computer science major, robotics team.

33:16.494 --> 33:19.080
And it wouldn't be your first time
hacking into a vehicle.

33:19.622 --> 33:24.210
You know, the "Thanks for the HPV, Dave"
blimp incident.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.670
He deserved that.

33:25.753 --> 33:27.255
And Rick deserved it too, right?

33:27.672 --> 33:29.882
I didn't kill Rick Randall.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.969
Go ahead. Check the activity.

33:33.344 --> 33:34.679
I have nothing to hide.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.391
Fine. Let me get our guy in here.

33:39.434 --> 33:40.935
[Ravi] She's gonna crack.

33:41.185 --> 33:42.729
Then not only will I have closed the case,

33:42.812 --> 33:44.480
I'd have crushed you
at raffle ticket sales.

33:44.564 --> 33:45.440
Clive solved it.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.316
You just told him
what you saw in a vision.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.818
Pot meet kettle.

33:48.901 --> 33:51.696
Besides, no way you can top my 320.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.197
324!

33:53.489 --> 33:54.949
I've still got two hours.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.202
As do I. So how many trombones
would you like to play you your...

33:58.286 --> 34:00.121
[imitating trombone] Womp-womps?

34:00.204 --> 34:01.914
[Jack] Look, officer,
I just need to talk to my daughter.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.624
Or that detective.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.251
What's his name? Babineaux?

34:05.501 --> 34:07.545
Please, my daughter is innocent.

34:07.670 --> 34:09.630
She should not be in there.

34:10.173 --> 34:11.132
Mr. Klein?

34:12.091 --> 34:15.219
Please, Emily didn't do this.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.346
I did.

34:21.517 --> 34:23.269
You hacked the Malevex?

34:23.478 --> 34:24.729
-Yeah.
-Huh.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.314
Okay, I'll bite.

34:26.814 --> 34:29.025
Why don't you tell Steve here
how you did it?

34:31.110 --> 34:34.906
Okay. First, I emailed Rick a phish link

34:34.989 --> 34:37.742
from a bogus Malevex support address

34:37.825 --> 34:39.410
asking to update his firmware.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.621
This link had a Trojan horse

34:41.704 --> 34:45.291
that installed a backdoor
into the car's telematic control unit,

34:45.374 --> 34:46.876
giving me access to the VPN.

34:46.959 --> 34:49.670
How did you overwrite the shadow files?

34:49.921 --> 34:52.090
I cracked 'em, downloaded firmware,

34:52.173 --> 34:55.134
and n-mapped the script,
so I could view the cipher text

34:55.218 --> 34:57.178
with a verbose switch.

34:57.970 --> 35:00.807
That's one way to do it.

35:01.974 --> 35:05.228
I spent all year
studying Emily's coding textbooks,

35:05.311 --> 35:07.605
just so I could get back at Rick
for what he did to us.

35:09.857 --> 35:11.109
I'll write it all down for you.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.611
Just let me talk to my daughter, will you?

35:37.844 --> 35:39.387
[Liv] So, if you're serious...

35:39.470 --> 35:41.514
[Martin] I'm absolutely serious.

35:42.765 --> 35:45.101
This one specializes in
long-term addiction.

35:45.184 --> 35:47.770
This one pairs patients
with the right therapist.

35:47.854 --> 35:50.106
They don't just send everybody
to the same guy.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.400
I can't believe you're doing this for me.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.278
Against my better judgment.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.781
You're a good person, Liv.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.825
Good people can't help themselves.

36:06.372 --> 36:08.541
Okay, General, you're all set.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.253
Hope you had a productive summit.

36:17.383 --> 36:18.509
Senator Hoover?

36:21.220 --> 36:23.181
So, go ahead
and roll your sleeve up for me.

36:33.941 --> 36:35.026
What the hell?

36:35.568 --> 36:37.904
You have just been scratched
and turned zombie.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.614
Please remain calm.

36:39.947 --> 36:42.742
This kit contains hair dye, self-tanner,

36:42.825 --> 36:45.369
and brains to last till you arrive in D.C.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.247
<i>If you want to survive,</i>

36:48.331 --> 36:51.751
<i>and you want this to stay secret,</i>
<i>you'll cooperate.</i>

36:52.793 --> 36:54.629
<i>Await further instructions.</i>

36:55.588 --> 36:57.298
<i>You work for us now.</i>

36:58.633 --> 37:00.384
Welcome back
to the United States, Senator.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.483
Here ya go.

37:18.152 --> 37:19.153
It's your turn.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.071
Sorry?

37:20.154 --> 37:21.197
Put something on the jukebox.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.615
I wanna make fun of your song.

37:24.158 --> 37:25.159
I'm kinda busy.

37:25.451 --> 37:27.495
Whoa, when did it get so cold in here?

37:28.412 --> 37:29.956
It's an automatic thermostat.

37:30.331 --> 37:33.626
I mean, I kinda thought we had
a fun little moment earlier.

37:33.709 --> 37:36.963
It's just, you know, I got a bar to run...

37:37.088 --> 37:39.507
Ah. Got it. Okay.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.050
Have a nice life.

37:42.510 --> 37:43.761
All right...

37:43.844 --> 37:45.846
[chuckles]

37:45.930 --> 37:48.933
Uh, couple of weeks ago,
this matchmaker told me

37:49.016 --> 37:51.519
that she knew a girl
who would be perfect for me.

37:51.602 --> 37:54.146
And before I could get any more details,
she was murdered--

37:54.230 --> 37:55.564
The girl?

37:55.648 --> 37:57.149
No. The matchmaker.

37:57.650 --> 38:01.112
And so,
I thought maybe you were that girl,

38:01.612 --> 38:05.449
I mean, you've got
the skull tattoo, but, you know...

38:05.866 --> 38:06.993
What?

38:08.160 --> 38:10.037
But you're gonna die, like, any second.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.290
-And, you know, I can't--
-Dude, we're all gonna die.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.334
Just means I gotta get through
my bucket list faster than you.

38:15.751 --> 38:19.005
But isn't the point
to just rock out till we clock out?

38:19.714 --> 38:21.674
I guess when you put it like that.

38:22.758 --> 38:24.635
So, like,
what's on this bucket list thing?

38:25.803 --> 38:27.847
Well, for starters.

38:28.264 --> 38:30.057
I've always wanted to be in a bar fight.

38:40.192 --> 38:43.070
My song. It's perfect for the occasion.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.158
[grunts]

38:49.535 --> 38:50.786
It's happening.

38:51.620 --> 38:52.955
Most definitely.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.874
Are you sure we should do this?

38:56.042 --> 38:57.460
We can get hurt.

38:57.543 --> 38:59.295
-[glass breaking]
-What the hell.

39:07.887 --> 39:10.264
Are you and Major in for dinner
with me and Peyton tonight?

39:10.765 --> 39:13.059
I can't tonight. I'm seeing my dad.

39:14.226 --> 39:15.353
Really?

39:15.728 --> 39:18.105
I know. Probably a dumb idea.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.483
But when has that ever stopped me before?

39:20.566 --> 39:22.026
Congratulations!

39:22.109 --> 39:23.319
-In your face!
-Suck it, loser!

39:25.404 --> 39:27.239
You tied.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.493
Maybe you can split it.

39:39.919 --> 39:42.463
You know, I don't really care much
for biking anyway.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.215
I don't have room for it. You take it.

39:48.302 --> 39:49.929
[reporter on TV]
<i>Liv Moore understood the stakes</i>

39:50.012 --> 39:53.432
<i>when she took over Seattle's</i>
<i>largest human smuggling organization.</i>

39:53.516 --> 39:55.768
<i>She was there when</i>
<i>her predecessor was executed.</i>

39:56.811 --> 39:59.063
<i>She resuscitated the organization</i>
<i>when others believed</i>

39:59.146 --> 40:02.566
<i>Fillmore-Graves's attempt at intimidation</i>
<i>had succeeded.</i>

40:04.318 --> 40:07.029
[reporter continues indistinctly]

40:14.078 --> 40:17.706
You'll be pleased to know Riley's mission
was a success.

40:18.499 --> 40:24.088
She got Spud out of the city
to scratch the doctor at the VA hospital,

40:24.422 --> 40:28.634
and select delegates
have now been turned zombie.

40:30.010 --> 40:32.513
Good, good.

40:33.973 --> 40:36.350
Be careful with that one, sir.

40:36.434 --> 40:41.772
She has a tendency to stick her nose
where it does not belong.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.816
A real pain in the ass.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.235
I've heard.

40:46.318 --> 40:49.947
Just, I would hate
for a conflict of interest to arise.

40:50.364 --> 40:51.699
Don't worry.

40:55.369 --> 40:57.413
I know what I'm doing.

41:03.377 --> 41:05.379
