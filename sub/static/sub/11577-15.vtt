[BO narrating]
Previously on Lost Girl:

00:07.508 --> 00:09.373
[LAUREN] I think when she
found Trick and Aife it...

00:09.594 --> 00:11.926
Her mind couldn't
withstand the trauma.

00:12.138 --> 00:13.799
I'm having a baby.

00:14.015 --> 00:16.256
You know that you didn't
fail Trick, right Dyson?

00:16.475 --> 00:17.601
[LAUREN] You know that.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.641
l was his lieutenant, Lauren.

00:19.854 --> 00:20.889
I should've had his back.

00:21.105 --> 00:23.266
You have to wanna
come home, okay!

00:23.482 --> 00:25.313
He's gone.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.684
Trick's really gone.

00:28.905 --> 00:31.647
[JACK] I'd like you to give
your team a message for me.

00:59.977 --> 01:00.352
Where's Bo?

01:00.561 --> 01:01.801
Sh-She's supposed to be here!

01:02.021 --> 01:02.726
Bo!

01:02.939 --> 01:03.849
[LAUREN]
She must be upstairs.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.101
[coughing]

01:06.317 --> 01:07.978
[DYSON] Watch out.

01:08.194 --> 01:09.274
[KENZI]
I'm not leaving without her!

01:09.487 --> 01:10.943
[DYSON]
You can't! It's too dangerous.

01:11.155 --> 01:12.486
[MARK] Come on guys,
we need to get outta here!

01:12.698 --> 01:14.905
[crash]

01:19.497 --> 01:20.987
What the hell?

01:25.169 --> 01:27.160
Oh, shit.

01:27.380 --> 01:28.745
He did this.

01:28.965 --> 01:30.171
We're completely trapped.

01:30.383 --> 01:32.294
Jack did this!

01:56.659 --> 01:56.863
[opening theme]

01:56.867 --> 02:01.657
[opening theme]

02:02.748 --> 02:04.033
[beeping]

02:04.250 --> 02:06.286
[KENZI] Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit!

02:06.502 --> 02:08.038
[beeping]

02:08.254 --> 02:10.745
Uh, Bo? You're uh--

02:10.965 --> 02:11.454
lyelps}

02:11.674 --> 02:14.165
You're off carbs, right?

02:14.385 --> 02:22.053
[beeping]

02:24.854 --> 02:26.560
You uh, just got
out of a coma.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.933
You should be a on
a liquid diet, anyway.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.060
[30}
Thanks, Kenzi.

02:30.276 --> 02:32.562
But you don't have
to stick around.

02:32.778 --> 02:33.938
Dude, are you kidding me?

02:34.155 --> 02:35.565
You just lost Trick and Aife.

02:35.781 --> 02:39.069
And Jack is not going to stop.

02:39.285 --> 02:41.150
But I don't wanna
drag you into this.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.486
You left for a
very good reason.

02:43.706 --> 02:46.789
And I came back for
a very good reason.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.492
I went to Spain to get
away from the Fae,

02:49.712 --> 02:51.248
not from my bestie.

02:54.925 --> 02:58.543
Besides, this crack shack
will always be home.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.800
[KENZI]
So, what's the plan?

03:03.017 --> 03:04.097
I don't know yet.

03:04.310 --> 03:07.177
But I do know that it
involves the Pyrippus.

03:07.396 --> 03:11.059
Mythology says that it's
Hades' Hell Horse.

03:11.275 --> 03:13.482
[BO] And | just
have to find it.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.686
Hey. We gotta find it.

03:18.491 --> 03:21.073
I'm gonna go check up on Tamsin.
See if preggo wants some Eggo.

03:21.285 --> 03:22.786
Okay.

03:25.122 --> 03:25.986
[KENZI]
Hey Tamsin!

03:26.207 --> 03:27.413
I better not see any
stretch marks, dude.

03:27.625 --> 03:31.288
You know how baby bumps
freak me out, Alien-styles.

03:31.504 --> 03:32.835
Vex!

03:34.715 --> 03:35.830
Bo!

03:36.050 --> 03:39.133
Okay. Hang on, buddy. Hang on.

03:42.765 --> 03:44.881
Oh my god.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.601
Tamsin.

04:10.459 --> 04:14.122
[JACK clears throat]

04:14.338 --> 04:17.876
So...

04:18.092 --> 04:20.674
how we doing this morning?

04:20.886 --> 04:23.753
Knock me up, lock me up,
and now you wanna chat?

04:31.397 --> 04:34.013
[JACK]
Oh, baby, you look tired.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.848
Have you been having
trouble sleeping?

04:36.068 --> 04:37.604
What do you think?

04:42.533 --> 04:45.149
I think you need to
take care of yourself.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.325
[JACK] You're about
to become a momma.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.028
Which means you
need to learn

04:49.248 --> 04:53.491
to put the baby's needs
ahead of your own.

04:53.711 --> 04:57.295
So, you can raise it
to be a demon child?

04:57.506 --> 05:00.168
[TAMSIN] If this baby grows
up to be anything like Bo,

05:00.384 --> 05:02.045
you're out of luck.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.717
Raising her to be your
"agent of darkness"

05:03.929 --> 05:06.011
didn't really pan out, did it?

05:09.560 --> 05:12.518
[JACK] Someone who can
better serve my needs.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.345
I think I'm gonna throw up.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.305
Morning sickness, huh?

05:16.525 --> 05:18.902
General disgust.

05:19.111 --> 05:23.901
[JACK] Well, if it's
all right with you,

05:24.116 --> 05:26.323
I'd like to do a
biophysical profile.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.820
Check the amniotic fluid,

05:28.037 --> 05:31.200
make sure everything
is okay with my baby.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.754
Last time I checked,
it was my body.

05:37.963 --> 05:41.376
So don't for one second
think this baby is yours.

05:41.592 --> 05:45.710
That's the spunk I love. Hm.

05:55.564 --> 05:56.940
[LAUREN]
His vocal chords were severed,

05:57.149 --> 05:58.013
but his arteries weren't cut.

05:58.234 --> 05:59.519
It's the only reason
he's still alive.

05:59.735 --> 06:00.941
Did Jack do this to you?

06:01.153 --> 06:02.188
Vex, where's Tamsin?

06:02.404 --> 06:03.029
[DYSON]
Jack take her?

06:03.239 --> 06:05.446
[LAUREN]
Guys, he can't talk.

06:05.658 --> 06:08.195
Hopefully he will,
but in the meantime...

06:10.955 --> 06:13.537
Vex, who did this to you?

06:19.630 --> 06:20.961
Guess that means Jack.

06:21.173 --> 06:21.958
He must have Tamsin.

06:22.174 --> 06:25.132
[BO] And she's all alone with
him, just like my mother was.

06:25.344 --> 06:26.880
Who knows what
he's done to her.

06:27.096 --> 06:27.551
Let's go.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.264
We tried that already!

06:29.473 --> 06:31.134
Jack is more powerful than us.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.214
We can't just
leave her with him.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.970
[BO] Well, we can't just
walk in there either.

06:34.186 --> 06:37.019
That's how people get killed.
We have to be smart.

06:38.107 --> 06:39.313
You're right.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.436
But I can't just sit here.

06:42.528 --> 06:43.893
Vex, Vex, what are you doing?

06:44.113 --> 06:47.150
You can't just Mesmer me
into giving you more morphine!

06:47.366 --> 06:48.196
Okay!

06:49.868 --> 06:51.904
Turn me into an enabler.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.200
[sighs]

06:57.293 --> 06:59.079
Well, what about this?

06:59.295 --> 07:01.627
I don't know what
Jack is planning,

07:01.839 --> 07:02.954
[BO] but I think
it has something to do

07:03.173 --> 07:04.333
with the Pyrippus.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.039
The Pyrippus?

07:05.259 --> 07:07.341
Yes, and I think that
that horseshoe can control it.

07:07.553 --> 07:08.303
[30}
Why else would Hephaestus

07:08.512 --> 07:09.422
have forged it for me?

07:09.638 --> 07:11.629
Well, what do you say we
go get this crazy horse?

07:11.849 --> 07:15.012
We need to come
up with a plan.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.726
Okay.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.021
Trick, Aife, Vex, Tamsin...

07:21.233 --> 07:23.394
All of Jack's victims
have one thing in common.

07:23.611 --> 07:24.475
Whatever he is planning--

07:24.695 --> 07:25.901
All roads lead to Bo.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.353
Whatever was his end game,

07:27.573 --> 07:32.442
| mean--he's been planning it
from the moment I was born.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.455
If that's true,
then who else would know?

07:37.666 --> 07:39.327
Who was there at your birth?

07:39.543 --> 07:40.453
Aife.

07:40.669 --> 07:41.328
The nurse...

07:41.545 --> 07:44.537
Everyone with answers is dead.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.887
How could you
possibly know that?

08:02.149 --> 08:04.060
Ask Evony.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.275
This is where Evony lives now?

08:15.496 --> 08:17.578
Damn, girl.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.585
[BO] Just so you know,
she's really sick.

08:24.797 --> 08:26.662
She might not look
like her Morrigan self.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.668
Her karma's a
bitch disease, got it.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.923
Thank you.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.595
[30}
No thanks.

08:35.808 --> 08:37.844
[KENZI]
Fresh mimosas, respect.

08:38.060 --> 08:40.847
Bo! Her butler has a butler.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.052
[EVONY]
I would like to acknowledge

08:42.272 --> 08:44.524
the Board of Directors
who toiled so hard

08:44.733 --> 08:46.644
to put together
this fundraiser--

08:46.860 --> 08:52.071
Cynthia, Helen, Meredith--

08:52.282 --> 08:57.527
you all went above and beyond to
make today a smashing success.

08:57.746 --> 09:01.113
Thank you all for coming.
Your support is crucial

09:01.333 --> 09:03.824
if we are going to find
a cure for this disease.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.002
[applause]

09:07.214 --> 09:08.715
She doesn't look
that sick to me.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.209
Yeah, no kidding.

09:10.426 --> 09:11.541
[EVONY]
But before I go on,

09:11.760 --> 09:13.921
I would love if you would
all give a very warm welcome

09:14.138 --> 09:16.470
to two very special guests.

09:16.682 --> 09:21.597
Bo, Kenzi,
thank you for coming.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.427
[EVONY] I'm glad
you could make it.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.353
You're just in time
for high tea.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.555
[applause]

09:26.775 --> 09:29.107
Tamsin is missing, I don't
exactly have an appetite.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.570
Yeah well, we need answers,

09:30.779 --> 09:33.987
and looks like we're gonna
have to high tea to get them.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.874
[EVONY]
Cynthia! How many is that?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.290
Just kidding. Go nuts, girl.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.288
Being human is a riot.

09:47.504 --> 09:48.755
And the gossip. Ha!

09:48.964 --> 09:51.250
This committee has more drama
than a Dark Fae blood feud.

09:51.467 --> 09:52.456
Your fundraiser is impressive.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.463
Well I figure if I couldn't
Fae my way out of my disease,

09:55.679 --> 09:57.465
I might as well
throw money at it.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.672
As Committee Chair,
I've raised over

09:59.892 --> 10:01.757
100 million dollars
in ten days.

10:01.977 --> 10:04.093
Move over, Melinda Gates.

10:04.313 --> 10:05.928
So, to what do I owe
this little visit to?

10:06.148 --> 10:08.639
I assume you're not
here to donate money.

10:08.859 --> 10:10.815
I'm looking for the
midwife who abducted me.

10:11.028 --> 10:13.815
And Vex says that
you know where she is.

10:15.032 --> 10:17.990
You know, ever since I met you,
I've wanted to kill you.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.442
Yeah, so I've gathered.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.697
[EVONY] And not just because of
your porcelain complexion.

10:21.914 --> 10:23.279
When I learned the
Unaligned Succubus

10:23.499 --> 10:24.705
could suck multiple chis,

10:24.917 --> 10:27.078
I knew I had to
keep my eye on you.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.036
But when I couldn't figure
out what made you tick,

10:30.255 --> 10:31.836
| just wanted you dead.

10:32.049 --> 10:33.414
Good strategy, decisive.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.841
What else do you do
with a weird mole?

10:36.053 --> 10:37.338
You burn it off.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.840
Always love being
compared to a weird mole.

10:40.057 --> 10:42.514
But now that I'm human,
I'm a lot more lax

10:42.726 --> 10:44.557
about the secrets
of the Dark Fae.

10:44.770 --> 10:48.638
So, do you have any
leads on my midwife?

10:48.857 --> 10:51.394
Trick saved her from
execution years ago.

10:51.610 --> 10:54.693
He thought he'd pulled one
over on me, but I took her.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.020
Figured she'd come
in handy when it

10:56.240 --> 10:57.901
came time
to taking you down.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.573
You knew, all this time,
and you said nothing.

11:00.786 --> 11:04.074
I wanted you dead,
why would I tell you anything?

11:04.289 --> 11:06.200
But things are different now.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.407
[EVONY] Funny what being
human does to you.

11:08.627 --> 11:11.835
I could never figure out
why you always chose humans.

11:12.047 --> 11:16.165
Now, I'm starting to see why.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.467
Nice bling, by the way.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.546
Thanks, Trick left it to me.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.554
I heard.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.385
My condolences.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.596
If the Light Fae wasn't
enough of a gong show,

11:30.816 --> 11:32.681
I can't imagine what
losing the Ash will do.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.983
And with Hades
at large, forget it.

11:35.195 --> 11:39.780
Hades got Tamsin pregnant,
and then he took her.

11:39.992 --> 11:42.199
Here we go again.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.453
Take it from someone who
likes to get what she wants.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.950
He won't stop.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.657
Which is why we need
to find my midwife.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.459
So where is she?

11:56.758 --> 12:00.626
Fine, she plays with my ponies.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.632
Bo's midwife is a brony?

12:02.848 --> 12:04.679
[EVONY]
| locked her up at my ranch.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.348
Turns out she was
great with the horses,

12:06.560 --> 12:09.552
so I figured what the hell,
let her take care of them.

12:09.771 --> 12:12.228
I needed someone
to shovel the shit.

12:12.441 --> 12:15.148
Fae horse ranch?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.914
Jack?

12:39.134 --> 12:40.874
Shit.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.062
[JACK]
Hey, hey, hey!

12:58.278 --> 13:00.189
What's all the ruckus?

13:00.405 --> 13:01.485
You okay?

13:01.698 --> 13:05.441
Sure, nothing
like cage living...

13:06.578 --> 13:09.615
Take it easy, can't be too
careful in your condition.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.742
You try not eating for a day.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.917
Hey, if you were hungry,
all you had to do was ask.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.753
Phoenix eggs,
hope you like scrambled.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.259
Bon appetit.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.760
[TAMSIN]
| just lost my appetite.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.342
[JACK]
Come on, now.

13:31.561 --> 13:35.850
Remember,
you're eating for two.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.532
Atta girl.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.714
[MARK] The Dal's
been closed since...

14:06.930 --> 14:10.764
But the deliveries
keep on coming.

14:10.976 --> 14:13.262
He was loved by many people.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.972
I keep expecting to see
him standing there.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.977
[DYSON]
If we're gonna defeat Hades,

14:24.197 --> 14:25.858
we need to gather our strength.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.110
I wanna call Consilium.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.315
What's that?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.037
[DYSON] It's a gathering
of the most powerful

14:31.246 --> 14:34.079
Fae Elders in the world.

14:34.291 --> 14:38.284
Consilium hasn't been called
in over 1,200 years.

14:44.509 --> 14:48.878
|n Trick's lair, in the
fireplace, there's a censer.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.928
I want you to
burn these in it.

14:51.141 --> 14:54.383
It will summon the
Light Fae Elders.

14:54.603 --> 14:56.514
And what about
the Dark Elders?

14:56.730 --> 14:58.345
How do we summon them?

14:58.565 --> 15:01.398
You release a flock of ravens.
It's called a Black Cloud.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.271
Where do | get these ravens?

15:03.487 --> 15:05.352
No, | only want you
to summon the Light Fae.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.858
Why? I mean,
power in numbers, right?

15:08.075 --> 15:09.531
We're gonna need all
the help we can get.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.654
[DYSON] The Dark have no
place at our Councils.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.986
[MARK]
Well, what's the difference?

15:14.206 --> 15:15.662
Between the Light and the Dark?

15:15.874 --> 15:20.789
Yeah, I mean, how do you know if
you're Light or Dark anyways?

15:21.004 --> 15:23.666
Trust me, you know.

15:23.882 --> 15:26.123
Stick with the Light.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.454
[BO] I can't believe Evony
hid her all these years.

15:57.666 --> 16:00.032
[KENZI] Let's just hope
it's not too late.

16:02.087 --> 16:07.172
[BO] Okay, midwife.
What has Evony done with you?

16:08.593 --> 16:10.424
[KENZI]
Are we there yet?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.135
[30}
Come on, Kenzi.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.266
[squelch]

16:15.475 --> 16:19.093
Aw, no! Not the Choos.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.848
Oh my god.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.850
I guess we're not alone.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.946
She'll be driving six
white horses when she comes.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.078
[neighing]

16:57.809 --> 17:00.676
[KENZI]
Um. Bobo?

17:00.896 --> 17:03.512
Are we like, Fae horse
whispering right now?

17:03.732 --> 17:05.313
Should I uh--

17:05.525 --> 17:07.561
should I leave y'all alone?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.229
[WOMAN]
They're happy to see you.

17:17.287 --> 17:20.745
I know you.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.913
Lou Ann Heidegger,
you were on death row.

17:23.126 --> 17:24.536
You're supposed to be dead.

17:24.753 --> 17:27.119
[KENZI]
Are you a ghost?

17:27.339 --> 17:31.378
Trick saved me from execution.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.709
I owe him my life.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.095
You're my midwife.

17:46.024 --> 17:49.061
[BO] But we met at the jail
years ago, and you didn't--

17:49.277 --> 17:50.062
[LOU ANN]
Say anything?

17:50.278 --> 17:54.317
Trick made me promise
not to for my protection.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.397
He made mistakes with
his own daughter--

17:56.618 --> 17:58.074
[BO] Aife.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.787
[LOU ANN]
He wanted to make up for it,

17:59.996 --> 18:02.954
so he hired me to rescue
her from the Dark.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.747
[30}
Wait, Trick hired you?

18:04.960 --> 18:07.076
When he found out
Aife was pregnant,

18:07.295 --> 18:09.672
he asked me to birth
you and take you too.

18:09.881 --> 18:13.123
But the day I arrived,
you'd already been born.

18:13.343 --> 18:14.879
Aife was sick.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.086
She wanted to kill you, Bo.

18:17.305 --> 18:20.092
So, I took you, and hid
you among humans.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.048
It was Trick...

18:22.269 --> 18:23.008
lwish I'd known.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.184
He always had your back.

18:25.397 --> 18:28.605
He wanted to keep you as far
away from the Fae as possible

18:28.817 --> 18:30.808
for your own protection.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.649
Why have you come now?

18:34.864 --> 18:36.820
I think my father is
trying to get me back.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.944
I need to find the Pyrippus.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.320
The Pyrippus?

18:40.537 --> 18:41.777
Hell Horse?

18:41.997 --> 18:43.487
[KENZI]
Evil Steed? Devil's Pony?

18:43.707 --> 18:45.447
It's been depicted as a
stallion that breathes fire,

18:45.667 --> 18:47.658
and I know my father has
something to do with it.

18:47.877 --> 18:51.085
And we think we can
control it with this.

18:51.298 --> 18:54.461
Saddle up,
we're going for a ride.

18:54.676 --> 18:57.167
Did she just say ride?

18:57.387 --> 18:59.378
Oh boy.

19:11.568 --> 19:16.733
[JACK] I'll be back very soon.
You try to get some rest.

19:41.306 --> 19:44.924
Work with me. C'mon.

19:46.603 --> 19:48.594
[JACK]
Going somewhere?

19:48.813 --> 19:50.428
I thought you left.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.938
| forgot to ask you if you
needed anything from the outside.

19:56.154 --> 20:00.272
But I can see you're um,
trying to stretch your legs.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.528
Legs?

20:02.744 --> 20:04.609
No.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.569
You forgot when
you chose a breed

20:06.790 --> 20:10.624
that Valkyries like me...

20:10.835 --> 20:13.121
we have wings.

20:15.465 --> 20:19.049
Darling, you won't be
using those for awhile.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.466
What the hell did you do?

20:20.678 --> 20:25.217
[JACK] | clipped your wings
while you were sleeping.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.388
You what?

20:26.601 --> 20:29.843
It's not wise to fly
in your condition.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.936
I know why Aife
wanted to kill Bo.

20:40.407 --> 20:46.323
If this baby's evil, maybe
I should do the same thing.

20:47.831 --> 20:50.789
You really gonna do that?

20:54.796 --> 20:57.037
No.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.669
[fork clatters]

21:08.184 --> 21:11.347
Because I'm not gonna
let this baby be evil.

21:11.563 --> 21:14.100
I'm not going to let
this baby serve you.

21:14.315 --> 21:18.308
[JACK] I look forward
to seeing you try.

21:19.737 --> 21:24.276
I said I will not
let that happen.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.608
Tamsin, come on,

21:26.828 --> 21:31.162
we both know what'll happen
when the baby's born.

21:42.385 --> 21:46.970
[TAMSIN sobbing]

21:47.182 --> 21:48.718
[KENZI]
What're their names?

21:48.933 --> 21:50.389
[LOU ANN]
Bo is riding Llamrei.

21:50.602 --> 21:52.934
She was once owned
by King Arthur.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.228
And this is Bucephalus,

21:55.440 --> 21:58.307
He led Alexander
the Fae to victory.

21:58.526 --> 22:00.187
[KENZI] And who did my
guy lead to victory?

22:00.403 --> 22:02.189
That's Otis,
he never had a master.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.986
But he's definitely
one of a kind.

22:04.199 --> 22:05.109
[farting]

22:05.325 --> 22:07.862
[KENZI] Oh, god. Of course
I get the farty pony.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.159
This trail ride is nice,
but can we pick up the pace?

22:10.371 --> 22:11.577
We're on a bit of a clock.

22:11.789 --> 22:12.744
[LOU ANN]
We're nearly there, Bo.

22:12.957 --> 22:13.946
But I do have to warn you--

22:14.167 --> 22:16.624
the stallion is wild
and extremely dangerous.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.622
Do you think it's the Pyrippus?

22:18.838 --> 22:21.375
We'll know soon enough.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.836
So, from midwife to rancher.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.543
How'd that happen?

22:27.972 --> 22:32.306
The Morrigan took me from one
prison and put me in another.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.352
Not that that mattered.

22:35.563 --> 22:39.772
When I lost my kids
nothing mattered.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.360
[LOU ANN] Even after
Trick rescued me

22:41.569 --> 22:43.560
I had nothing to live for.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.359
Working with the horses helps,

22:47.575 --> 22:50.032
something to love
that loves you back.

22:50.245 --> 22:55.865
It's funny, this was meant to
be a prison, but it saved me.

22:56.084 --> 23:00.043
I can't believe what
they did to your family.

23:00.255 --> 23:05.545
I miss my kids
every day, my husband.

23:08.471 --> 23:10.712
How are you doing back there?

23:10.932 --> 23:13.423
[LOU ANN] Unicorns are
known to be a bit gassy.

23:13.643 --> 23:15.884
Hold up. Otis is a unicorn?

23:16.104 --> 23:18.265
He's a rescue from Scotland.

23:18.481 --> 23:20.642
His horn was
cut off by poachers.

23:20.858 --> 23:23.986
He's the last one of his kind.

23:24.195 --> 23:27.358
I can't believe I'm
riding a freaking unicorn.

23:27.574 --> 23:28.313
[farting]

23:28.533 --> 23:33.653
[KENZI]
Ugh. Oh god. Ugh, Otis.

23:35.999 --> 23:37.409
Ew...

23:42.964 --> 23:44.704
[LOU ANN]
There he is.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.598
Is that a horse or a dragon?

23:52.807 --> 23:55.173
It's the Pyrippus.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.934
[DARK FAE ELDER 1]
If Hades walks among us,

24:06.154 --> 24:07.064
we must take action.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.395
[LIGHT FAE ELDER 1]
We risk revealing the Fae.

24:08.615 --> 24:11.698
We have no choice, we must
protect our own at all costs.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.901
Says the Fae who kills
humans in broad daylight.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.487
[FAE ELDERS arguing]

24:17.707 --> 24:18.867
What the hell is this?

24:19.083 --> 24:20.664
A Consilium?

24:20.877 --> 24:22.458
I told you to gather
the Light Fae.

24:22.670 --> 24:23.580
I did.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.377
Just the Light Fae.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.126
Why didn't you
do what I asked?

24:27.342 --> 24:28.627
We're dealing with Hades here.

24:28.843 --> 24:31.630
These are the most powerful
Fae that exist in our world.

24:31.846 --> 24:32.881
So, what are we
talking about,

24:33.097 --> 24:34.803
a bunch of
wizards in bathrobes?

24:35.016 --> 24:36.176
You don't get it.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.974
With the Light Ash dead and
the Morrigan turned human,

24:39.187 --> 24:40.848
there's no one
in control here.

24:41.064 --> 24:43.055
Trick left us the Dal
because it's a Sanctuary.

24:43.274 --> 24:44.650
Does that look like
a Sanctuary to you?

24:44.859 --> 24:45.564
Just because they're Dark
doesn't mean

24:45.777 --> 24:46.983
they can't help us.

24:47.195 --> 24:48.685
The divide between
the Light and the Dark

24:48.905 --> 24:53.194
has always stood
for good reason.

24:53.409 --> 24:54.910
Of course you'd say that.

24:56.579 --> 24:57.409
[LOU ANN]
We did everything.

24:57.622 --> 24:59.487
Isolated him,
tried to gain his trust,

24:59.707 --> 25:01.322
but no one has been
able to break him.

25:01.542 --> 25:02.748
What do you mean, "break him"?

25:02.960 --> 25:05.667
Horses are wild by nature,
so the one who breaks them

25:05.880 --> 25:08.462
gains their loyalty
and servitude for life.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.633
They need to surrender
to be trained properly.

25:12.679 --> 25:13.919
Hey, what are you doing?

25:14.138 --> 25:18.222
Bo! Do you not see the flames
coming out of his nose?

25:29.362 --> 25:31.148
[BO] Easy, boy.

25:55.096 --> 25:56.757
Easy boy.

25:58.975 --> 26:03.139
Hey, hey, good boy.

26:04.897 --> 26:08.435
[BO] You don't like being
in here, do you, boy? Huh?

26:08.651 --> 26:10.152
It's okay.

26:10.361 --> 26:13.273
It's all right. Easy.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.821
Well, if I ain't a brony.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.868
Good boy.

26:26.878 --> 26:27.617
It's too big.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.043
Are you sure?

26:29.255 --> 26:31.120
[BO] He looks exactly like the
Pyrippus from the painting.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.592
I don't get it.
Why doesn't it fit?

26:33.801 --> 26:35.666
Are you sure you're
looking for a horse?

26:35.887 --> 26:36.672
What do you mean?

26:36.888 --> 26:38.924
[LOU ANN] Horses have often
been used in works of art

26:39.140 --> 26:41.381
to depict powerful
forces of nature.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.009
You said you were trying
to break this stallion

26:45.229 --> 26:48.642
to gain his loyalty
and servitude.

26:48.858 --> 26:51.270
That's what Jack's
been trying to do to me.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.315
In one of her rants,
Aife once said that

26:54.530 --> 26:56.066
she wanted to kill
her baby because

26:56.282 --> 26:58.648
someone put something
evil inside it.

26:58.868 --> 27:01.575
Well, maybe it wasn't
just one of her rants.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.864
Does that mean the
Pyrippus is...?

27:08.419 --> 27:11.252
--[BO] So.
--[KENZI] So.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.625
[30}
I'm the Pyrippus.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.547
The Pyrippus... is me.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.920
I'm trying, I'm struggling.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.377
I've known you for what?
Five years, and yes,

27:19.597 --> 27:21.462
you do have a
lustrous mane of hair.

27:21.682 --> 27:23.388
But you don't
have a horse face.

27:23.601 --> 27:24.431
It's more... oval.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.555
What if when I chi-sucked
all those people

27:26.771 --> 27:28.011
to save Lauren from the Lich--

27:28.231 --> 27:30.643
And super-sucked us all to save
Dyson during your dawning--

27:30.858 --> 27:32.723
What if that was the
Pyrippus taking over?

27:32.944 --> 27:34.935
What if it's been
inside me all this time?

27:35.154 --> 27:37.770
Well, then Jack has been playing
the long game for a long time.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.855
But I can't control it, Kenzi.

27:40.076 --> 27:41.612
I mean, when it happens...

27:41.828 --> 27:42.738
I lose myself.

27:42.954 --> 27:44.910
Scary voice,
crazy eyes. I know.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.659
I felt my father taking
control of the Pyrippus

27:47.875 --> 27:49.615
when the cinvat opened.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.622
What if he...

27:51.838 --> 27:53.374
I don't wanna
lose myself again.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.580
I'm not gonna let you, okay?

27:55.800 --> 27:57.916
Wait.

27:58.135 --> 28:02.378
If Jack created the
Pyrippus, he needs it.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.099
--Uh-huh.
--I need to go to him.

28:04.308 --> 28:05.809
What?! You said we
can't just go in there--

28:06.018 --> 28:07.974
If he is trying to break my
spirit like I'm some kind of

28:08.187 --> 28:11.645
wild horse, then I have to
help him with the next step.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.940
Which is?

28:14.151 --> 28:16.142
| surrender.

28:16.362 --> 28:19.399
Surrender, right, of course.

28:19.615 --> 28:20.365
[KENZI] Uh, hold up.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.486
Can you explain that last
part again, please?

28:22.702 --> 28:25.614
Jack is not going to stop
until he gets what he wants.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.240
The Pyrippus. Me.

28:27.456 --> 28:28.536
Bo, you can't.

28:28.749 --> 28:32.583
[BO] Kenzi,
I don't have a choice.

28:54.817 --> 28:58.059
[FAE ELDERS arguing]

28:58.279 --> 29:00.691
We have to get
them out of here.

29:00.907 --> 29:03.023
Or you could, I don't know,
lead the meeting,

29:03.242 --> 29:04.357
seeing as they're already here.

29:04.577 --> 29:05.862
It's not my place.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.330
[MARK] Right.
Right, because you don't lead.

29:08.539 --> 29:10.325
You just serve.

29:10.541 --> 29:14.079
We don't work with the Dark.

29:14.295 --> 29:16.126
What if I was Dark?

29:18.007 --> 29:19.497
You're not.

29:25.389 --> 29:27.926
Vex was almost killed
trying to protect Tamsin.

29:28.142 --> 29:29.803
Vex?

29:30.019 --> 29:31.975
For all we know, he could
be colluding with Jack.

29:32.188 --> 29:36.272
You've never trusted him.

29:36.484 --> 29:38.475
But I do.

29:41.572 --> 29:46.487
And unlike you,
he's not a coward.

29:46.702 --> 29:49.569
I will let that go
because you have no idea

29:49.789 --> 29:52.781
what it is to be
responsible for other people.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.161
[DYSON] I will let that
go because you are still

29:55.378 --> 29:59.041
a child who runs
from his own problems.

29:59.256 --> 30:01.542
You haven't even shifted yet.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.766
Mark?

30:22.571 --> 30:25.187
[DYSON] Come out.

30:25.408 --> 30:27.444
Come talk to me.

30:29.912 --> 30:33.780
[creature growling]

30:34.000 --> 30:40.371
You shifted. It's okay.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.500
But you need
to shift back now.

30:42.717 --> 30:44.878
[g rowls]

30:45.094 --> 30:47.710
The pull of the animal is
strong in the beginning.

30:47.930 --> 30:50.387
You can get lost in it.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.055
You're going to feel an urge.

30:52.268 --> 30:53.633
[g rowls]

30:53.853 --> 30:59.348
It'll feel strange at first,
like your bones are breaking.

30:59.567 --> 31:02.104
Your body's gonna
resist the change,

31:02.319 --> 31:05.402
but you need to
push through it.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.150
Just breathe, Mark.

31:07.366 --> 31:10.904
[growling]

31:11.120 --> 31:12.826
That's it!

31:17.793 --> 31:20.125
[MARK panting]

31:20.337 --> 31:22.168
[DYSON]
Come on.

31:26.427 --> 31:28.543
You did it.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.468
[DYSON]
I thought you'd be a wolf,

31:33.684 --> 31:36.767
but you manifested
what's inside of you.

31:40.107 --> 31:42.769
Now you get to choose.

31:42.985 --> 31:47.399
No. I'm not going to choose.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.778
You have to, we all do.

31:51.994 --> 31:54.576
No. Bo didn't.

31:54.789 --> 31:56.404
That's different.

32:00.795 --> 32:02.205
Okay.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.914
I guess it's
time for me to go.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.091
Mark, stop!

32:15.142 --> 32:16.973
I love you.

32:21.315 --> 32:28.858
[DYSON] You're my son.
And you will always be my son.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.150
[elevator dings]

32:44.964 --> 32:46.124
[BO] Jack?

32:46.340 --> 32:47.955
Bo?

32:51.804 --> 32:54.045
Bo! Bo, I'm in here!

[JACK] You're home.

32:57.226 --> 32:59.558
[TAMSIN] Bo! Bo!

32:59.770 --> 33:01.556
Ah, don't worry about Tamsin.

33:01.772 --> 33:03.603
[JACK] She's emotional,
but she's fine.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.727
--[TAMS|N] Bo!
--[JACK] Hormones.

33:05.943 --> 33:09.356
I didn't come for her,
I came to see you.

33:09.572 --> 33:10.937
Hm!

33:11.157 --> 33:14.149
Last time we spoke,

33:14.368 --> 33:16.359
you weren't
very happy with me.

33:16.579 --> 33:20.413
Well, I'm here now.
To help you.

33:20.624 --> 33:23.331
What makes you think
I still need your help?

33:23.544 --> 33:27.002
[JACK]
I've moved on to Plan B.

33:27.214 --> 33:28.545
Plan B?

33:28.757 --> 33:31.134
B for baby.

33:31.343 --> 33:35.177
[TAMSIN] Bo, you have to
help me! He took my wings!

33:35.389 --> 33:36.549
Bo!

33:36.765 --> 33:38.721
[JACK chuckles]

33:40.436 --> 33:42.893
But a baby is just a baby.

33:43.105 --> 33:47.018
Not a sure thing,
and I'm a sure thing.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.310
[JACK]
It may delay my plans,

33:50.529 --> 33:54.147
but babies have a
tendency to grow up.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.027
And I can wait.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.780
'Cause if anything,
I am patient.

33:58.996 --> 34:01.362
As you know.

34:01.582 --> 34:04.369
You waited a long time for me.

34:04.585 --> 34:05.791
But I'm here now.

34:06.003 --> 34:09.040
[JACK]
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.

34:09.256 --> 34:11.292
And you don't need Tamsin.

34:11.508 --> 34:12.918
There's no point in
letting her die in there.

34:13.135 --> 34:15.501
[JACK] Oh, Bo,
is that what you think?

34:15.721 --> 34:18.804
I have no intention
of killing Tamsin.

34:19.016 --> 34:23.635
Unfortunately, the baby
will do that all by itself.

34:25.064 --> 34:26.929
What are you talking about?

34:32.279 --> 34:34.986
and Tamsin is no exception.

34:41.163 --> 34:44.826
I'm here to do whatever
you need me to do.

34:45.042 --> 34:46.907
Forgive me if I don't
believe you, Bo.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.378
But I'm having a hard time

34:48.587 --> 34:50.373
following this
little act of yours.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.580
It's not an act.

34:54.385 --> 34:56.171
For a long time,

34:56.387 --> 34:58.799
I've been trying to figure
out who I really am,

34:59.014 --> 35:02.051
where I really came from--
what I'm really meant to do.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.133
And the people that I have
come to call my family

35:04.353 --> 35:06.514
have been lying
to me from day one.

35:06.730 --> 35:10.814
I'm glad to hear you
finally say that.

35:12.945 --> 35:15.106
[BO] But you've been
honest with me

35:15.322 --> 35:17.529
from the minute I released
you from Tartarus.

35:17.741 --> 35:20.153
I said I'd never lie to you.

35:20.369 --> 35:22.030
[BO] I know that now.

35:22.246 --> 35:25.329
I know why
you did what you did

35:25.541 --> 35:29.033
to Trick and Aife. You had to.

35:29.253 --> 35:31.494
[BO] It was the only way
that I could see the truth.

35:31.714 --> 35:37.505
And the truth is, Dad,
we have a greater purpose.

35:37.720 --> 35:40.712
You're the only one
that I can trust.

35:40.931 --> 35:43.013
You're my family.

35:45.019 --> 35:48.432
I'm glad to see I've
earned your trust.

35:48.647 --> 35:52.014
But if you wanna work with me,

35:52.234 --> 35:55.271
there's something
I need you to do.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.690
Just like the Light
to cower in fear.

36:00.909 --> 36:04.322
Just like the Dark to run
brazenly into the enemy's camp.

36:04.538 --> 36:06.324
Then what do you propose?

36:06.540 --> 36:07.655
We summon the Jotunn.

36:07.875 --> 36:09.035
The Frost Giants?

36:09.251 --> 36:11.207
Like we did for the
battle of Ragnarok.

36:11.420 --> 36:12.330
And give them take control?

than 1,000 years.

face the greatest foe

Now, more than ever,
we must come together.

Why do you consider the Light

36:53.379 --> 36:54.744
in this matter?

36:54.963 --> 36:57.215
Only the Dark can
vanquish Hades.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.380
Hades is neither
Light nor Dark,

36:59.593 --> 37:01.424
he transcends both.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.502
Why should we trust a wolf?

who's been intimate

37:05.474 --> 37:10.264
with the Unaligned Succubus,
Hades' own daughter.

37:10.479 --> 37:14.813
It's true, Bo is
Hades' daughter.

37:15.025 --> 37:16.856
But she is also
the granddaughter

37:17.069 --> 37:18.275
of the Blood King.

[FAE ELDERS gasp, murmur]

37:20.614 --> 37:22.570

37:22.783 --> 37:25.274
That was mere rumour.

37:25.494 --> 37:27.485
Trick hid his secret well.

37:27.704 --> 37:30.662
If Trick was the Blood King,
he would have shown his power.

37:30.874 --> 37:36.915
That was not his way.
He could have killed you all.

37:38.715 --> 37:41.127
But instead he chose peace.

37:42.761 --> 37:47.801

was a place of Sanctuary.

37:48.016 --> 37:54.262
So, as a tribute
to the Blood King,

I ask that you join me
in creating that peace.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.198
What do you propose we do?

38:10.414 --> 38:16.000
We must unite our strength
if we are to vanquish Hades.

Why won't you help me?

42:48.567 --> 42:50.649
Bo...

42:50.861 --> 42:52.817
Does that bother you?

42:54.406 --> 42:57.273
Not at all.

42:57.492 --> 42:59.574
Good.

42:59.786 --> 43:01.993
Are you ready?

43:03.915 --> 43:06.873
I was born ready.
