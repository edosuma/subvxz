WEBVTT

00:02.088 --> 00:03.265
If it isn't mom and dad..

00:03.289 --> 00:04.900
I mean, now that you left rehab

00:04.924 --> 00:06.202
we need to talk about, uh, you know

00:06.226 --> 00:07.937
if you're ready to come back to work.

00:07.961 --> 00:10.973
I'm gonna go for Sundance.
I need to recast your part.

00:10.997 --> 00:13.909
We're about to go back to
work playing two people

00:13.933 --> 00:15.111
who are madly in love..

00:15.135 --> 00:17.146
You know, maybe we should
talk about what happened.

00:17.170 --> 00:19.081
Alright, y'all.
You come take some photos.

00:19.105 --> 00:21.083
Hey, what's your director's
name over there?

00:21.107 --> 00:22.151
- Maricel.
- Hey, Nina.

00:22.175 --> 00:23.319
You can't bring those in here.

00:23.343 --> 00:27.022
If my cameras can't come in,
I'm not either.

00:27.046 --> 00:28.190
Close the door.

00:28.214 --> 00:30.226
How did I feel when I first found out

00:30.250 --> 00:32.350
Jordan and Nina had
been having an affair?

00:33.987 --> 00:35.253
I was shocked.

00:39.325 --> 00:40.402
'Alexis?'

00:42.362 --> 00:44.340
Alexis, hey, get up.

00:44.364 --> 00:46.242
Time to get up.

00:46.266 --> 00:47.376
What?

00:47.400 --> 00:50.946
- Do we have something?
- Oh, we do now, thanks to you.

00:50.970 --> 00:52.948
I got a car waiting outside.

00:52.972 --> 00:55.217
I've booked you into a
lovely little spot in Ojai

00:55.241 --> 00:56.352
for the next couple of nights.

00:56.376 --> 00:58.254
- Why?
- At 2 o'clock.

00:58.278 --> 01:00.990
The promos for tonight's
Alex-alicious drop.

01:01.014 --> 01:02.992
And every clip will show Tangey

01:03.016 --> 01:05.260
telling you that Nina and
Jordan had an affair.

01:05.285 --> 01:06.295
Oh, God, no.

01:06.319 --> 01:08.898
Every media outlet,
newspaper and magazine

01:08.922 --> 01:10.199
will be calling you for a comment.

01:10.223 --> 01:12.968
But you're just not gonna
be reachable, okay?

01:12.992 --> 01:14.003
I don't want the story getting out

01:14.027 --> 01:15.037
until we let it out.

01:15.061 --> 01:16.338
Did I upload that to you?

01:16.362 --> 01:19.175
And to the editors, they're
cutting it in right now.

01:19.199 --> 01:20.242
And it is gold.

01:22.135 --> 01:23.179
No, no, no. Okay, wait.

01:23.203 --> 01:25.314
I was angry at Nina for blocking me

01:25.338 --> 01:27.349
from the Facebook Live,
but we can't air that.

01:27.373 --> 01:29.185
Oh, nuh-uh. No, you don't.

01:29.209 --> 01:31.320
You are not changing your mind again.

01:31.344 --> 01:32.955
Let's get you packed.

01:32.979 --> 01:35.925
- We can't, Tangey is gonna be...
- That's fine.

01:35.949 --> 01:37.159
Tangey is the messenger.

01:37.183 --> 01:39.195
Nobody's gonna be
talkin' about anything

01:39.219 --> 01:41.152
except what Nina did.

01:42.222 --> 01:44.200
Tangey never signed a release form.

01:44.224 --> 01:46.202
Oh, yes, she did.

01:46.226 --> 01:49.271
This morning,
along with a dozen other papers

01:49.295 --> 01:51.407
separating me from her business.

01:51.431 --> 01:54.410
There might have been a
release form tucked in there.

01:54.434 --> 01:56.412
Trust me, when this drops

01:56.436 --> 01:59.114
it's gonna cause the
shitstorm of the century

01:59.138 --> 02:01.116
and you don't want to
be anywhere near it.

02:01.140 --> 02:03.240
Now, where is your suitcase?

02:05.011 --> 02:11.665
sync and corrections by awaqeded
www.addic7ed.com

02:12.385 --> 02:16.131
It's not working for me anymore.

02:16.155 --> 02:17.366
I'm sorry.

02:17.390 --> 02:20.035
It's not you, I think you're amazing

02:20.059 --> 02:24.295
but... I think that we
should go our separate ways.

02:28.067 --> 02:30.212
- That was great.
- Really?

02:30.236 --> 02:32.181
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

02:32.205 --> 02:34.016
It just kinda feels
wrong to dump the agent

02:34.040 --> 02:35.050
who repped my mom.

02:35.074 --> 02:36.151
And Sid's like family.

02:36.175 --> 02:37.353
But you wouldn't leave your career

02:37.377 --> 02:38.954
in the hands of your grandpa

02:38.978 --> 02:40.055
if he's not gettin' you auditions.

02:40.079 --> 02:41.357
I know, but I'm..

02:41.381 --> 02:44.960
Vagihydrate was a
national commercial gas.

02:44.984 --> 02:47.396
You should be rocketing to
the next level right now.

02:47.420 --> 02:49.131
And I know you can.

02:49.155 --> 02:52.368
If I dump the guy whose heyday
was before "Smart Votes."

02:52.392 --> 02:54.158
And the internet.

02:56.162 --> 02:57.262
Yeah.

02:57.997 --> 02:59.942
Okay..

02:59.966 --> 03:01.310
I'll text you when the deed is done.

03:01.334 --> 03:04.101
- Cool. I'll be on set.
- Okay.

03:10.343 --> 03:12.054
Holy crap! Adam!

03:12.078 --> 03:14.290
It's him. I..

03:14.314 --> 03:17.348
You can do this. Rip off the Band-Aid.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.420
Hey, Sid, I was gonna call you today.

03:24.257 --> 03:25.357
Yeah.

03:26.159 --> 03:28.259
I've been thinking and..

03:30.363 --> 03:32.263
S-sure, I like horror.

03:34.334 --> 03:36.011
Really?

03:36.035 --> 03:38.080
Third dead girl.

03:38.104 --> 03:40.171
Th-that sounds great.
Yeah, I'll be there.

03:41.174 --> 03:43.152
Oh, that's not a problem.

03:43.176 --> 03:45.242
Wouldn't be the first
time I've been topless.

03:46.312 --> 03:49.124
Okay. Thank you.

03:49.148 --> 03:51.393
He got me an audition
for a slasher flick.

03:51.417 --> 03:53.162
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

03:53.186 --> 03:57.166
Maybe the producer's a buddy
of Sid's from way back

03:57.190 --> 03:58.968
so it's probably just
some straight to video

03:58.992 --> 04:01.337
but... it's something.

04:01.361 --> 04:03.906
Hell, yes, it's something.

04:03.930 --> 04:05.307
Sid lives to see another day.

04:08.067 --> 04:10.283
'Sometimes a man's entire

04:10.308 --> 04:12.147
life is defined by a single choice.'

04:12.171 --> 04:13.916
'Like this one!'

04:13.940 --> 04:16.185
'Suffocate under the
weight of obligation'

04:16.209 --> 04:17.886
'or be a man'

04:17.910 --> 04:19.188
'and choose your own path.'

04:19.212 --> 04:21.890
'Choose freedom. Choose me..'

04:21.914 --> 04:23.892
Twelve auditions yesterday,
no one comes close

04:23.916 --> 04:25.327
to what I need for Georgia.

04:25.351 --> 04:28.052
So, what you're saying
is I'm irreplaceable.

04:28.921 --> 04:30.232
Don't let it get to your head.

04:30.256 --> 04:31.333
Hmm, no.

04:31.357 --> 04:33.902
No. You have more auditions to get to

04:33.926 --> 04:36.105
and I cannot be late for set.

04:36.129 --> 04:39.396
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.
Boots or sandals?

04:40.967 --> 04:43.078
- Sandals.
- Boots. Right? Yeah.

04:43.102 --> 04:45.180
Also, should I bring a jacket?
I should, right?

04:45.204 --> 04:47.182
I mean, it's probably
a little cold today.

04:47.206 --> 04:48.350
You think these two
colors go together?

04:48.374 --> 04:49.385
I think they go well.

04:49.409 --> 04:51.186
You've changed clothes four times.

04:51.210 --> 04:52.287
No, I have not.

04:52.311 --> 04:53.989
The thing you do when you're nervous.

04:54.013 --> 04:56.158
- It's cute.
- I'm not nervous.

04:56.182 --> 04:59.294
I'm just, you know,
it's, it's always sunny in LA.

04:59.318 --> 05:00.896
So you never know, is it boot weather

05:00.920 --> 05:01.930
'is it sandal weather..'

05:01.954 --> 05:02.931
You're going straight to wardrobe

05:02.955 --> 05:05.022
once you get to set, Paige.

05:06.092 --> 05:09.872
Fine. You got me.
I'm a little tiny bit nervous.

05:09.896 --> 05:12.307
Hey, a lot has happened
in the two months

05:12.331 --> 05:14.910
since "Locked" shut down. I get it.

05:14.934 --> 05:18.247
Wha-what if I can't switch
from Georgia back to August?

05:18.271 --> 05:22.317
I mean, I, I-I think I can,
but what, what if I can't?

05:22.341 --> 05:24.953
There's nothin' to be nervous about

05:24.977 --> 05:26.955
'cause you're gonna be great.

05:26.979 --> 05:28.957
And you're right, go with the boots.

05:30.283 --> 05:32.895
Thanks. Should I wear my pug sweater?

05:32.919 --> 05:34.930
I love that little scrunchy
face on the pug. It..

05:39.158 --> 05:42.004
I'm not comin' at you as
a studio head, alright?

05:42.028 --> 05:43.906
I care about you.

05:43.930 --> 05:45.107
And I want to make sure...

05:45.131 --> 05:48.277
I told you, I'm focused, I'm healthy..

05:48.301 --> 05:50.045
...and I'm here to work.

05:50.069 --> 05:51.346
Rice.

05:51.370 --> 05:53.348
But I don't want Nina on set.

05:53.372 --> 05:56.118
It's a simple request
and I think justified.

05:56.142 --> 05:57.319
There are two sides of every story

05:57.343 --> 05:58.954
and you don't know both.

05:58.978 --> 06:00.089
Let me guess

06:00.113 --> 06:01.223
you're gonna tell me.

06:01.247 --> 06:04.093
When Nina got pregnant, I was married.

06:04.117 --> 06:07.096
And my reputation for
sleeping around was..

06:07.120 --> 06:08.197
Uh, it was well earned.

06:08.221 --> 06:10.132
I'm not proud of that,
that's not the point.

06:10.156 --> 06:11.900
But she knew I wasn't
going to leave my wife

06:11.924 --> 06:12.935
and she knew I wasn't going to stop

06:12.959 --> 06:15.270
being a egomaniacal prick.

06:15.294 --> 06:17.394
Kale, celery, and cucumber.

06:18.965 --> 06:20.109
I can get you one if you want.

06:20.133 --> 06:22.211
I'll pass. Thank you.

06:22.235 --> 06:24.113
Uh, we should get going
if you wanna meditate

06:24.137 --> 06:26.014
and practice your lines
before hair and makeup.

06:26.038 --> 06:27.082
Mm.

06:27.106 --> 06:29.985
- Unless you guys need...
- No, we're good.

06:30.009 --> 06:32.321
- Okay.
- Hey, listen.

06:32.345 --> 06:36.225
I am not kicking Nina off the
set of her own film, Rainer.

06:36.249 --> 06:37.259
I forgave her.

06:37.283 --> 06:39.261
And maybe, you know, maybe it's time

06:39.285 --> 06:41.352
you forgive her too.

06:49.195 --> 06:52.074
Wasn't sure if you like
cappuccinos, mochas, or lattes

06:52.098 --> 06:54.164
so I got you one of each.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.978
Plain black for me.

06:56.002 --> 06:57.980
I have a pot brewing in the back.

06:58.004 --> 06:59.270
But thanks anyway.

07:02.008 --> 07:04.219
Uh, let me help you with that.

07:04.243 --> 07:05.921
You didn't drive all the
way down here to help

07:05.945 --> 07:08.957
set up art supplies or
bring me coffee, so..

07:08.981 --> 07:10.259
Oh, well, it's to make it up to you

07:10.283 --> 07:13.162
for flaking on game night.
A friend needed me.

07:13.186 --> 07:15.197
Yeah, it's the kids who are
excited to hang with you

07:15.221 --> 07:16.965
not me.

07:16.989 --> 07:18.200
- That's fair.
- I'm sorry.

07:18.224 --> 07:19.334
I didn't mean it like that.

07:19.358 --> 07:21.336
It's just, it's my job
to protect these kids

07:21.360 --> 07:22.905
from broken promises.

07:22.929 --> 07:25.029
They get too many of those at home.

07:27.133 --> 07:30.312
I practically grew up at a place
like this back in Chicago.

07:30.336 --> 07:33.115
Director was the hardest
working woman I knew.

07:33.139 --> 07:34.983
Me too.

07:35.007 --> 07:38.053
In junior high, I was a regular
at the city block in Gardena.

07:38.077 --> 07:39.988
Home away from home.

07:40.012 --> 07:41.112
Hmm.

07:46.118 --> 07:48.185
Do you have a caramel latte in there?

07:48.955 --> 07:51.066
Oh, definitely.

07:56.062 --> 07:57.806
If I can swing by the
Film Commission office

07:57.807 --> 07:59.007
and get my permit and
still be at Cassie's

07:59.031 --> 08:00.075
to set up for auditions.

08:00.099 --> 08:01.310
Oh, crap, the realtor needs

08:01.334 --> 08:03.011
our best and final offer today

08:03.035 --> 08:04.279
if we still want the house.

08:04.303 --> 08:06.370
- It has to be today?
- Yeah.

08:08.941 --> 08:10.919
I can't believe this.

08:10.943 --> 08:12.921
We're buying a house in
the Hollywood Hills.

08:12.945 --> 08:15.057
I've literally thought about
this moment for so long

08:15.081 --> 08:16.925
but.. Also the mortgage.

08:16.949 --> 08:19.061
That's kinda scary, you know,
paying it for the next 30 years.

08:19.085 --> 08:21.263
But I guess that's adulting, right?

08:21.287 --> 08:25.067
And the parties on that
deck are gonna be so cool.

08:25.091 --> 08:27.157
This is happening so fast.

08:28.227 --> 08:30.427
Wait, you're not getting
cold feet, are you?

08:31.330 --> 08:33.342
No. No. It's just, uh...

08:33.366 --> 08:36.111
Jake, if you're not a
hundred percent in

08:36.135 --> 08:37.879
you should've mentioned it sooner.

08:37.903 --> 08:40.881
You're gonna be late for your
first day back on "Locked."

08:40.905 --> 08:42.972
We can talk about it later.

08:43.909 --> 08:45.976
The offer needs to go in today.

08:48.914 --> 08:50.158
Ugh. I gotta go.

08:50.182 --> 08:51.960
Look, Paige, wait.

08:51.984 --> 08:53.317
I'm gonna be late.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.074

09:02.946 --> 09:05.691
If we had air hockey
at my club, forget it.

09:05.715 --> 09:06.992
You couldn't drag me out.

09:07.016 --> 09:09.762
I mean, we practically
have to sometimes.

09:09.786 --> 09:10.896
Coming here is like Christmas morning

09:10.920 --> 09:12.698
for most of these kids.

09:12.722 --> 09:15.000
That's right. I never
thought about it like that.

09:15.024 --> 09:17.636
Oh, I love to play Santa.
What do you guys need?

09:17.660 --> 09:19.638
Basketballs, art supplies?

09:19.662 --> 09:22.775
Uh, actually, most people want
to donate money or things

09:22.799 --> 09:25.967
but... what these kids
really need are role models.

09:26.936 --> 09:28.581
Oh.

09:28.605 --> 09:29.782
Okay then.

09:29.806 --> 09:32.651
Jordan, I'm talkin' about
somebody like you.

09:32.675 --> 09:35.754
Having face time with a
successful adult like yourself

09:35.778 --> 09:36.989
would broaden their horizons.

09:37.013 --> 09:38.591
If you really want to help

09:38.615 --> 09:40.025
I think you should do a talkback.

09:40.049 --> 09:42.595
Sure, I'm game. But what's a talkback?

09:42.619 --> 09:44.563
You'll sit down with
the kids for an hour

09:44.587 --> 09:46.765
tell your story,
answer their questions.

09:46.789 --> 09:48.868
It'll inspire them to see
a young man of color

09:48.892 --> 09:50.925
doing something
positive with his life.

09:51.828 --> 09:53.939
I'm in. Sign me up.

09:58.801 --> 10:01.881
"Our whole life's about to change.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.583
"I was thinking about our future.

10:04.607 --> 10:06.585
"Solly's general store is up for sale.

10:06.609 --> 10:08.787
- I know it's, uh.."
- Surprise!

10:08.811 --> 10:09.922
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:09.946 --> 10:11.056
I was in the neighborhood

10:11.080 --> 10:12.858
and I had Adam get me a drive-on

10:12.882 --> 10:14.994
because how could I not
wish my BFF good luck

10:15.018 --> 10:17.084
on her first day back on "Locked."

10:17.787 --> 10:18.797
Mmm.

10:18.821 --> 10:20.866
Buena suerte mi, Amiga.

10:20.890 --> 10:21.990
Thanks.

10:23.626 --> 10:26.772
So, did you break up with Sid?
How did that go?

10:26.796 --> 10:29.942
Uhhh. Well, it didn't happen.

10:29.966 --> 10:31.644
'Because right when I
was gonna dump him'

10:31.668 --> 10:33.646
for not getting me any auditions

10:33.670 --> 10:34.813
he got me an audition.

10:34.837 --> 10:35.881
Really? That's great.

10:35.905 --> 10:38.884
Well, I mean, not that Sid part,
but, you know

10:38.908 --> 10:40.719
you've been wanting to get out there.

10:40.743 --> 10:42.021
Yeah, it's just a horror flick.

10:42.045 --> 10:43.722
Cass, don't say that.

10:43.746 --> 10:45.858
You love scary movies
more than anyone.

10:45.882 --> 10:47.793
True, and I'd be playing the floozy

10:47.817 --> 10:49.728
who gets hacked to
death with a pickaxe.

10:49.752 --> 10:50.985
Hmm.

10:52.755 --> 10:53.933
Who's the prezzy from?

10:53.957 --> 10:55.156
Rainer.

11:00.029 --> 11:01.129
Yeah.

11:04.801 --> 11:06.679
That's, um, us.

11:06.703 --> 11:09.582
Well, it's Noah and, and August

11:09.606 --> 11:11.784
reuniting in the scene
we're about to shoot.

11:11.808 --> 11:14.019
- Whoa!
- I know. It surprised me too.

11:14.043 --> 11:16.655
This is a very romantic gift.

11:16.679 --> 11:17.856
Yeah, one day he's telling me

11:17.880 --> 11:19.592
how madly in love he
is with his soulmate

11:19.616 --> 11:23.829
and the next he's sending me
some, uh, very mixed signals.

11:23.853 --> 11:26.665
Well, you should probably go thank him

11:26.689 --> 11:28.756
and find out what's up.

11:38.868 --> 11:39.968
Paige.

11:41.938 --> 11:44.783
Hi. Oh, wow, uh..

11:44.807 --> 11:47.653
Harper Tate. I was obsessed
with you on "My Secret Diary."

11:47.677 --> 11:49.655
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Oh, you too.

11:49.679 --> 11:51.946
You know, Rainer's told
me a lot about you.

11:53.116 --> 11:55.094
Well, I, uh, I wanted to thank you

11:55.118 --> 11:56.962
for this beautiful little crew gift.

11:56.986 --> 11:59.665
Oh, it's cute, right?

11:59.689 --> 12:01.767
I might have had a little help.

12:01.791 --> 12:04.770
- She's got amazing taste.
- Stop it.

12:04.794 --> 12:07.773
Hey, I thought maybe we should
walk on the set together

12:07.797 --> 12:08.974
for our first scene.

12:08.998 --> 12:10.609
Oh. Yeah?

12:10.633 --> 12:11.910
The media has been a
nightmare for both of us.

12:11.934 --> 12:14.046
I'm sick of the sad sack Rainer GIFs.

12:14.070 --> 12:16.682
And them hating on you
'cause you're with Jake.

12:16.706 --> 12:18.984
"Hashtag Paigesucks."

12:19.008 --> 12:20.108
Brutal.

12:21.678 --> 12:24.657
- Yeah.
- Let's shut down the gossip.

12:24.681 --> 12:26.747
Put up a united front.

12:28.751 --> 12:30.663
- I like that idea.
- It was Harper's.

12:32.822 --> 12:34.933
- Isn't she the best?
- Aw.

12:57.013 --> 12:59.692
Tange, it's me.

12:59.716 --> 13:01.760
Please, please, call me back ASAP.

13:01.784 --> 13:04.596
Before 2 o'clock if possible.

13:04.620 --> 13:05.853
It's really important.

13:12.862 --> 13:14.606
How is Ally?

13:14.630 --> 13:16.742
Thank you for coming down
and singing that up for me.

13:16.766 --> 13:18.610
That's exactly what the song needed.

13:18.634 --> 13:20.579
Oh, happy to do it.

13:20.603 --> 13:21.780
Look at that.

13:21.804 --> 13:25.651
My two favorite singers
in LA all in one day.

13:25.675 --> 13:27.953
Tangey Turner, you know Ally Brooke

13:27.977 --> 13:29.054
from "Fifth Harmony," right?

13:29.078 --> 13:32.691
Hey! Oh, my God.
Nice to meet you, Tangey.

13:32.715 --> 13:34.993
- I love your music.
- Oh, thank you so much.

13:35.017 --> 13:36.995
I, I loved your last album.

13:37.019 --> 13:38.864
I mean, the one before
the country album.

13:38.888 --> 13:39.888
You and everybody else.

13:41.758 --> 13:43.869
Well, I'm volunteering
with the ASPCA today

13:43.893 --> 13:45.037
so I have to run.

13:45.061 --> 13:48.941
Wow! So, voice of an angel
and heart of an angel?

13:48.965 --> 13:49.975
Oh..

13:49.999 --> 13:51.076
I know you're a busy woman.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.978
- Thank you once again.
- Thank you, Pablo.

13:53.002 --> 13:54.813
- I'mma call you later, okay?
- Okay, sounds good.

13:54.837 --> 13:55.848
- So nice to meet you.
- You too.

13:55.872 --> 13:58.717
Will you walk her to the car for me?

13:59.976 --> 14:01.642
Take care.

14:02.745 --> 14:04.022
This a bad time?

14:04.046 --> 14:07.693
It's never a bad time to
talk to Ms. Tangey Turner.

14:07.717 --> 14:09.728
I mean, unless you're
not here to talk.

14:09.752 --> 14:11.797
- You're right about that.
- Hmm.

14:11.821 --> 14:14.833
- So, you came to get paid?
- Not exactly.

14:14.857 --> 14:17.636
You know, you ran off pretty
fast the other night.

14:17.660 --> 14:18.804
But it's all good.

14:18.828 --> 14:20.895
Pablo Money got you, baby.

14:22.932 --> 14:24.698
Actually..

14:25.968 --> 14:28.035
...there's something
I want you to hear.

14:40.716 --> 14:41.927
- See what I mean?
- Yeah.

14:41.951 --> 14:43.829
You can practically
hear the rumor mill

14:43.853 --> 14:45.375
grinding to a halt.

14:45.376 --> 14:47.443
I'm gonna go talk to our new director.

14:48.379 --> 14:50.357
There you are.

14:50.381 --> 14:51.747
Undeniably handsome.

14:54.385 --> 14:55.762
I take after my dad.

14:58.623 --> 14:59.723
Ah..

15:01.392 --> 15:02.469
You're welcome by the way.

15:02.493 --> 15:04.338
For what?

15:04.362 --> 15:06.340
I told him to, um,
give you another chance

15:06.364 --> 15:09.343
and see, uh.. And you're talking.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.478
It was hardly a conversation.

15:11.502 --> 15:14.248
But, at least he's
acknowledging my existence.

15:14.272 --> 15:16.032
I'm getting the hang of
this parenting thing.

15:16.674 --> 15:18.440
It comes naturally.

15:19.510 --> 15:20.621
There you are, Tasha.

15:20.645 --> 15:21.688
Listen, before we get going

15:21.712 --> 15:24.258
I'd like to introduce you to everyone.

15:24.282 --> 15:25.659
So, if I could have
everyone's attention

15:25.683 --> 15:27.394
'please, just for a minute.'

15:27.418 --> 15:28.695
'As some of you may have heard'

15:28.719 --> 15:32.599
we lost our director
Wyatt over the hiatus..

15:32.623 --> 15:36.470
...but I am thrilled to
introduce his replacement.

15:36.494 --> 15:40.607
Academy Award winning Tasha Zaman.

15:40.631 --> 15:42.398
Thank you.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.479
Thank you, Nina. Thank you.

15:45.503 --> 15:48.715
Well, I'm delighted to be
working with all of you.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.285
'Our plan is to get
"Locked" finished in time'

15:51.309 --> 15:52.586
'for the holiday movie push.'

15:52.610 --> 15:54.488
And it's going to be brilliant.

15:54.512 --> 15:55.656
Thank you.

16:00.651 --> 16:02.384
What is happening?

16:07.458 --> 16:08.618
'Did you get this TMZ thing?'

16:09.660 --> 16:13.273
Okay, is this about Jordan?

16:13.297 --> 16:15.342
I found out that he and
Nina had an affair.

16:50.433 --> 16:52.545
Oh my God! Okay.. What if he relapses?

16:52.569 --> 16:55.181
- Hey, Rainer, open up.
- Honey, please, please.

16:55.205 --> 16:58.217
- Let me explain.
- No. Rainer, we need to talk.

16:58.241 --> 16:59.385
He's never gonna talk to me again.

16:59.409 --> 17:03.356
No, you made the right decision
not telling him at rehab.

17:03.380 --> 17:04.480
Wait, you knew?

17:05.582 --> 17:07.159
- Can you believe this?
- 'Okay..'

17:07.183 --> 17:09.194
Why don't we all just
sit down for a sec?

17:09.219 --> 17:11.464
No wonder I'm such a screw-up.
Look at you two.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.432
I never stood a chance.

17:13.455 --> 17:14.500
- Rainer..
- Rainer, where are you going?

17:14.523 --> 17:18.137
Back to set! But not you.

17:18.161 --> 17:19.605
'I don't want to see
your face at work'

17:19.628 --> 17:21.695
or anywhere else for that matter.

17:29.172 --> 17:31.317
You're pretty good at math.
Is that your favorite subject?

17:31.341 --> 17:32.573
I like recess.

17:34.244 --> 17:36.289
Boom! Park Place, sucker.

17:36.313 --> 17:38.424
- You know where that's at?
- You're looking at it.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.359
No, man, I mean, in the world.

17:40.383 --> 17:42.428
- New York.
- That's Park Avenue.

17:42.452 --> 17:43.462
Close though.

17:43.486 --> 17:45.164
Park Place is in Atlantic City.

17:45.188 --> 17:46.299
Oh, you've been there?

17:46.323 --> 17:48.601
Went to a premiere there
for a movie I did.

17:48.625 --> 17:51.404
- You like bein' in movies?
- Yeah, it's cool.

17:51.428 --> 17:52.572
I love what I do.

17:52.596 --> 17:54.373
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

17:54.397 --> 17:57.331
- Batman.
- Yeah! Okay, Bruce Wayne.

17:58.435 --> 18:01.414
Bam! Boardwalk. My old hangout.

18:01.438 --> 18:03.482
That's in Venice Beach.
You ever been there?

18:03.506 --> 18:06.419
No, I've never seen the
beach except on TV.

18:06.443 --> 18:08.421
Like, any beach, ever?

18:08.445 --> 18:09.545
No.

18:11.147 --> 18:13.125
Look, how 'bout I take you tomorrow?

18:13.149 --> 18:14.360
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.228
- Cool.
- 'Jordan!'

18:16.252 --> 18:18.264
Is it true? You sleep
with Rainer Devon's mom?

18:18.288 --> 18:19.465
What?

18:19.489 --> 18:21.534
- Why would you say that?
- Hey, this is private property.

18:21.558 --> 18:22.602
You guys can't be in here.

18:22.626 --> 18:24.403
- Get out!
- When did the affair start?

18:24.427 --> 18:27.206
Bet you don't want paint all
over that $10,000 camera.

18:27.230 --> 18:29.342
I'll do it. I'm serious. Get out!

18:29.366 --> 18:30.409
- Get out.
- Now!

18:30.433 --> 18:31.611
Get out. I'm calling the cops.

18:31.635 --> 18:33.412
- Get out!
- You're joking, ma'am?

18:33.436 --> 18:35.214
Move!

18:35.238 --> 18:37.416
- Just gettin' some shots.
- You guys okay?

18:37.440 --> 18:38.484
You okay?

18:40.377 --> 18:43.189
- Yeah, man.
- How long has it been goin' on?

18:43.213 --> 18:44.457
Uh, I'm sorry, I gotta go.

18:44.481 --> 18:45.591
I gotta go.

18:45.615 --> 18:47.226
There's a back door. Come on.

18:47.250 --> 18:48.594
Is that how you got your career?

18:48.618 --> 18:50.999
- Is that how you start..
- Why don't you at least speak..

18:52.322 --> 18:56.168
Jordan, I can't let you
take Isaiah to the beach.

18:56.192 --> 18:57.336
But I promised him.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.205
This place is a refuge for these kids

18:59.229 --> 19:01.107
like it was when we were little.

19:01.131 --> 19:03.542
I'm sorry about whatever
is going on with you.

19:03.566 --> 19:06.379
- But I can't have you here.
- 'How was she in bed?'

19:06.403 --> 19:07.635
Don't come back.

19:39.602 --> 19:41.380
Oh, my God! You're killin' me.

19:41.404 --> 19:43.337
What's the verdict?

19:44.474 --> 19:45.706
You got somethin'.

19:47.410 --> 19:50.356
- You don't like it.
- Come on, girl.

19:50.380 --> 19:53.259
You don't need me to tell
you that your music dope.

19:53.283 --> 19:55.594
- You know that.
- Really?

19:55.618 --> 19:58.464
'Cause... I wanted to
go back to my roots

19:58.488 --> 20:00.266
but I had like a...

20:00.290 --> 20:03.169
A little funk groove. I got that.

20:03.193 --> 20:06.472
I like how you put that little
Miami heat flavor in there.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.407
Nice flow. It's sharp.

20:08.431 --> 20:09.608
Like I said, you got something.

20:09.632 --> 20:12.478
So, what's the deal?
I don't hear you saying yes.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.346
Do you realize that our
duet from the club

20:14.370 --> 20:16.215
got seven million views?

20:16.239 --> 20:17.416
- Not bad.
- Huh.

20:17.440 --> 20:20.653
- Not bad at all.
- Oh, right.

20:20.677 --> 20:23.355
You probably get seven
million likes when you post

20:23.379 --> 20:24.779
a picture of your breakfast, right?

20:26.382 --> 20:30.329
Look, everybody want a little
piece of P. Money's magic.

20:30.353 --> 20:33.299
- Schedule's just tight.
- I get it, I get it.

20:33.323 --> 20:36.669
You have big players who
want to collaborate.

20:36.693 --> 20:39.727
But what if their ask's 70%, 80?

20:40.563 --> 20:42.363
And they have final say.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.479
I'm leaving my label and
I'm gonna start my own.

20:46.503 --> 20:48.481
If we work together

20:48.505 --> 20:51.484
we'll have a 50-50 split on
ownership and territory.

20:51.508 --> 20:56.288
That means creative freedom
and artistic control.

20:56.312 --> 20:58.412
Plus, no cap on royalties.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.293
So, tell me

21:01.317 --> 21:02.361
now who's getting paid?

21:04.487 --> 21:06.532
So you fine and smart.

21:11.494 --> 21:13.272
Do we have a deal?

21:13.296 --> 21:15.274
Miss Turner..

21:15.298 --> 21:19.267
...I promise that I will give
it serious consideration.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.353
- Maybe you should get that.
- Yeah.

21:27.377 --> 21:28.477
Yeah.

21:34.250 --> 21:35.516
Everything okay?

21:36.386 --> 21:38.397
Oh, my God!

21:38.421 --> 21:39.532
Are you kidding me?

21:39.556 --> 21:41.634
'Is this about Jordan?'

21:41.658 --> 21:43.669
'I found out that he and
Nina had an affair.'

21:43.693 --> 21:46.572
Oh, my God. Alexis, how could you?

21:48.598 --> 21:49.642
'Marker!'

21:49.666 --> 21:52.533
And... action!

22:06.382 --> 22:07.548
'August.'

22:11.387 --> 22:14.366
Noah. Is that really you?

22:14.390 --> 22:16.850
You have no idea how much I've
been waiting for this moment.

22:18.494 --> 22:19.627
And you..

22:22.532 --> 22:24.598
You're gonna be a daddy.

22:28.538 --> 22:30.316
- And cut!
- 'That's a cut.'

22:34.677 --> 22:37.323
Okay. Good, good.

22:37.347 --> 22:40.292
But remember, you've
been on the battlefield

22:40.316 --> 22:42.528
living an absolute nightmare, right?

22:42.552 --> 22:45.631
But now, after months of being away

22:45.655 --> 22:48.667
and pining for this
woman you're back home

22:48.691 --> 22:50.302
with the love of your life.

22:50.326 --> 22:52.438
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

22:52.462 --> 22:56.242
- You sure you're gonna be okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

22:56.266 --> 22:58.344
Alright. Going again. Back to one.

22:58.368 --> 22:59.600
'And marker.'

23:01.537 --> 23:03.415
Action.

23:03.439 --> 23:06.418
You have no idea how much I've
been waiting for this moment.

23:06.442 --> 23:08.254
Are-are we holding for that?

23:08.278 --> 23:10.456
I heard an airplane.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.225
- You heard that, right?
- 'And cut!'

23:13.249 --> 23:14.326
- Goin' again.
- 'Marker.'

23:14.350 --> 23:16.262
'Marker. Marker.'

23:16.286 --> 23:17.386
'Marker!'

23:18.521 --> 23:20.532
And action!

23:20.556 --> 23:23.457
You have no idea how much I've
been waiting for this moment.

23:25.662 --> 23:28.240
Stop. This is ridiculous.

23:28.264 --> 23:30.276
Okay, cut!

23:30.300 --> 23:31.443
- What is the problem?
- What's the problem?

23:31.467 --> 23:33.667
There's a guy wandering
around the woods.

23:34.637 --> 23:38.217
Uh, yes, you, dude.

23:38.241 --> 23:40.252
What're you doing moving
around during the take?

23:40.276 --> 23:42.388
Do you know how not cool this is?

23:42.412 --> 23:44.323
I'm in the middle of
an emotional scene.

23:44.347 --> 23:47.426
But instead of being in it,
I'm distracted by you.

23:47.450 --> 23:49.717
- 'Alright. We're gonna fix it.'
- Unbelievable!

23:51.220 --> 23:53.432
Why is it you can't
rely on anyone anymore?

23:53.456 --> 23:56.635
Let's take a ten. The sun's shifted.

23:56.659 --> 23:59.371
'Alright, let's relight, people.'

24:07.270 --> 24:09.448
Hi. I thought you had auditions.

24:09.472 --> 24:12.351
- What're you doing here?
- We're starting later.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.475
Besides, you're more important.

24:17.280 --> 24:18.479
They're beautiful.

24:19.282 --> 24:20.382
Thanks.

24:21.451 --> 24:23.529
I didn't like how we left things.

24:23.553 --> 24:25.252
Me either.

24:25.655 --> 24:27.499
What's going on with you?

24:27.523 --> 24:29.635
I just think we need to talk.

24:29.659 --> 24:31.637
Buying a house is a big step.

24:31.661 --> 24:33.639
Well, it is, but..

24:33.663 --> 24:36.608
Oh, first, can I tell you
what happened on set today?

24:36.632 --> 24:38.644
- Have you heard?
- No, what?

24:38.668 --> 24:42.648
Rainer found out that Jordan
and Nina had an affair.

24:42.672 --> 24:45.184
Like, right as we were about to roll.

24:45.208 --> 24:46.185
You're kidding?

24:46.209 --> 24:47.553
His mother and his best friend.

24:47.577 --> 24:48.587
Can you believe it?

24:48.611 --> 24:50.356
Oh, and it was on a preview

24:50.380 --> 24:51.490
of Alexis' show.

24:51.514 --> 24:53.559
So now, the whole world
knows, but of course

24:53.583 --> 24:55.461
Alexis is hiding out in Ojai...

24:55.485 --> 24:57.629
It's just like Alexis. Do
a napalm drop and ghost.

24:57.653 --> 25:00.299
How could she do that? She's one
of Rainer's closest friends.

25:00.323 --> 25:01.433
Is that a rhetorical question?

25:01.457 --> 25:03.268
I just can't believe he's still here

25:03.292 --> 25:05.371
w-working or trying to.

25:05.395 --> 25:06.405
Must be hard.

25:06.429 --> 25:07.473
Yeah, but it's the job, so..

25:07.497 --> 25:09.341
I'm really worried about him.

25:09.365 --> 25:10.542
He's having a really hard time.

25:10.566 --> 25:12.666
Okay, that's enough
about Rainer, alright?

25:14.537 --> 25:17.438
- What's your problem?
- Uh, what do you think?

25:18.374 --> 25:19.551
You seem overly concerned?

25:19.575 --> 25:22.154
I would say I'm
appropriately concerned.

25:22.178 --> 25:23.555
He's my co-star, and we only today

25:23.579 --> 25:25.591
just got back to a place where
he's talking to me again

25:25.615 --> 25:27.393
after refusing to see me in rehab.

25:27.417 --> 25:29.395
So, yeah, I'm concerned.

25:29.419 --> 25:31.463
Wait. You went to go see
him while he was in rehab?

25:31.487 --> 25:33.554
And you didn't think to tell me that?

25:38.665 --> 25:40.677
It's not that you went
to see Rainer in rehab

25:40.701 --> 25:41.844
it's that you didn't tell me.

25:41.868 --> 25:43.680
I would have told you if I had

25:43.704 --> 25:45.515
actually seen him, but I didn't.

25:45.539 --> 25:46.616
Do you still have feelings for him?

25:46.640 --> 25:47.650
What?

25:50.410 --> 25:52.822
- First team's up.
- Okay, thank you.

25:52.846 --> 25:54.490
Face it. It's the
elephant in the room.

25:54.514 --> 25:56.526
We never talked about you
going back to work with him

25:56.550 --> 25:57.794
shooting love scenes,
making out on camera...

25:57.818 --> 25:58.861
You didn't have a problem with me

25:58.885 --> 26:00.530
making out with Shane on your movie.

26:00.554 --> 26:03.421
That's completely different.
Okay? There's no history there.

26:04.791 --> 26:07.470
Is this why you're so
wishy-washy about the house?

26:07.494 --> 26:08.626
No!

26:10.530 --> 26:11.574
No, i-it's the timing.

26:11.598 --> 26:12.775
We're both doing a million
things right now.

26:12.799 --> 26:14.577
And when are we not busy?

26:14.601 --> 26:17.380
Plus, who doesn't dream of
living in such a killer place?

26:17.404 --> 26:19.382
Look, buying a house
is a really big deal.

26:19.406 --> 26:22.418
I know, but we need to give
our best and final offer.

26:24.578 --> 26:25.822
I'm sorry, they're
really chewing me out.

26:25.846 --> 26:27.612
Thank you, Adam.

26:30.851 --> 26:33.696
Can you please just come
to the final walk-through

26:33.720 --> 26:35.620
with me and we'll figure it out.

26:38.725 --> 26:40.737
Just say the word and
I'll get the car.

26:40.761 --> 26:41.838
We don't have to stay here.

26:41.862 --> 26:43.928
We can have this meeting
some other time.

26:45.565 --> 26:47.744
Just let me get this over with.

26:47.768 --> 26:48.868
Okay.

26:52.673 --> 26:54.472
Hey, Rain.

26:56.576 --> 26:59.511
I, uh, totally get it
if you wanna bail.

27:00.547 --> 27:02.525
Uh, I'm here.

27:02.549 --> 27:03.726
Literally.

27:03.750 --> 27:06.529
Okay, well, then I'll
give you the same advice

27:06.553 --> 27:08.564
you gave me when I was worried
that we couldn't play

27:08.588 --> 27:11.534
two people falling in love.

27:11.558 --> 27:13.636
It's called acting.

27:13.660 --> 27:15.471
You can escape from
everything, Rainer.

27:15.495 --> 27:17.774
The only thing that matters right now

27:17.798 --> 27:19.898
is right here with me.

27:20.834 --> 27:22.645
August.

27:22.669 --> 27:25.848
It's 1945, we're in love

27:25.872 --> 27:29.352
you just got back home from the war

27:29.376 --> 27:30.909
we're having our baby..

27:32.446 --> 27:34.646
We have our whole future ahead of us.

27:36.750 --> 27:39.451
So really, nothing else matters.

27:48.595 --> 27:50.528
- 'And perfect.'
- 'Marker.'

27:50.731 --> 27:52.408
Action.

27:52.432 --> 27:53.532
August.

27:55.502 --> 27:56.602
Noah.

27:58.505 --> 27:59.682
Is it really you?

27:59.706 --> 28:02.440
You have no idea how long
I've waited for this moment.

28:04.611 --> 28:05.844
And you..

28:06.680 --> 28:08.613
Yeah. Yeah.

28:10.350 --> 28:11.783
You're going to be a daddy.

29:04.371 --> 29:06.437
I'm so happy you're home.

29:09.543 --> 29:11.643
And... cut!

29:12.612 --> 29:13.790
Oh, my God, you guys.

29:13.814 --> 29:16.726
That was magical.

29:16.750 --> 29:19.429
It was exactly the chemistry
I was waiting for.

29:19.453 --> 29:21.531
Fantastic job. Great.

29:21.555 --> 29:23.421
'Alright. Moving on.'

29:24.624 --> 29:26.402
Good job.

29:26.426 --> 29:27.603
'That was my favorite scene.'

29:27.627 --> 29:29.505
'Make sure, make sure you mark that.'

29:29.529 --> 29:31.607
- 'Yeah.'
- Ah..

29:59.282 --> 30:00.448
'Yo, Rain?'

30:05.622 --> 30:07.688
Man, I wanted to tell you.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.403
Look, I'm sorry.

30:11.427 --> 30:13.239
I don't know how to
say how sorry I am...

30:13.263 --> 30:14.528
I can't, man.

30:15.532 --> 30:17.264
Not now.

30:18.201 --> 30:21.213
Please. I know what you must think.

30:21.237 --> 30:22.448
But when you went to
rehab the first time

30:22.472 --> 30:24.450
and I was living with
you guys, Nina was...

30:24.474 --> 30:25.673
My mom?

30:29.178 --> 30:30.478
That's just it.

30:32.415 --> 30:34.482
This is my mother.

30:37.387 --> 30:38.653
Pack your stuff.

30:51.301 --> 30:53.178
Damn it!

30:53.202 --> 30:54.246
Rainer's still not answering?

30:54.270 --> 30:55.481
No! It's not even 9 a.m.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.616
and this day's turned into
a total nightmare already.

30:57.640 --> 31:00.185
The blowout bar canceled
my standing appointment.

31:00.209 --> 31:02.521
The gate guard sneered at me
when I drove onto the lot

31:02.545 --> 31:05.558
and Joe at Crafty couldn't
even look me in the eye.

31:05.582 --> 31:07.393
I'll get your Crafty for you,
I booked Nick to come

31:07.417 --> 31:08.527
to your house for a standing blowout

31:08.551 --> 31:10.162
and the guard at gate six

31:10.186 --> 31:11.530
has a face set to resting bitch.

31:11.554 --> 31:12.598
Don't worry about him.

31:12.622 --> 31:14.333
There's one more thing.

31:14.357 --> 31:16.135
I found Jordan Wilder's
birth certificate

31:16.159 --> 31:17.202
and start paperwork.

31:17.226 --> 31:18.504
He lied about his age for "Backsplash"

31:18.528 --> 31:21.307
but by season two when
you two started to, uh..

31:21.331 --> 31:23.309
- He was 18.
- Yes.

31:23.333 --> 31:25.210
And we have proof.

31:25.234 --> 31:27.146
I am this close to liking you, Brian.

31:27.170 --> 31:28.480
- Thank you.
- Now get me Alan.

31:28.504 --> 31:30.282
That's actually why I came in.

31:30.306 --> 31:31.617
I hear through the assistant
grapevine that he just got

31:31.641 --> 31:34.286
called into an emergency
board meeting.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.670
I think we know what that's about.

31:42.218 --> 31:45.364
I still can't believe Jordan and Nina.

31:45.388 --> 31:47.633
Have things settled down
over there? How's Paige?

31:47.657 --> 31:50.536
Everyone's hanging in. How you doing?

31:50.560 --> 31:52.626
- You wanna know how I'm doing?
- Yeah.

31:56.666 --> 31:59.345
All these girls who look
pretty much exactly like me

31:59.369 --> 32:02.581
are here because this isn't a
cheap-ass slasher movie, Adam.

32:02.605 --> 32:04.416
It's a Toby Drake movie.

32:04.440 --> 32:05.484
Holy shit!

32:05.508 --> 32:07.386
Like, from the Phantom
Creek franchise?

32:07.410 --> 32:10.289
'Yes! What am I gonna do?'

32:10.313 --> 32:12.257
This is the biggest
audition of my life. I...

32:12.281 --> 32:14.348
First, deep breath.

32:16.419 --> 32:18.564
And then, go in there

32:18.588 --> 32:21.300
and pretend like it's the
crappy straight-to-video movie

32:21.324 --> 32:22.324
you thought it was.

32:23.359 --> 32:25.337
Yeah, see you're already laughing.

32:25.361 --> 32:26.572
No more nerves.

32:26.596 --> 32:28.140
You're gonna kill it.

32:28.164 --> 32:31.332
I'm gonna kill it.

32:39.175 --> 32:40.285
Where is she?

32:40.309 --> 32:42.421
You can't hide from
me forever, Alexis.

32:42.445 --> 32:44.512
I know where you live.

32:45.281 --> 32:47.393
Alexis isn't here

32:47.417 --> 32:49.595
so if you wanna have it out

32:49.619 --> 32:51.685
you're gonna have to
throw down with me.

32:55.324 --> 32:59.605
What kind of person destroys
lives for trashy reality TV?

32:59.629 --> 33:02.274
It's not trash.

33:02.298 --> 33:03.509
It's called a guilty pleasure.

33:03.533 --> 33:05.577
Whatever you want to call it.

33:05.601 --> 33:09.248
Mom, that video doesn't
just hurt Nina and Jordan.

33:09.272 --> 33:11.450
Did you ever think about how
this might affect Rainer?

33:11.474 --> 33:13.252
That's my fault?

33:13.276 --> 33:14.486
No, they should have
thought about that

33:14.510 --> 33:16.155
before they got so cozy.

33:16.179 --> 33:18.290
No, you should have
thought about the fact

33:18.314 --> 33:20.359
that I never signed a release form.

33:20.383 --> 33:23.262
You Alex' best lawyer? 'Cause
I'm suin' both of your asses.

33:23.286 --> 33:24.530
You signed a release.

33:24.554 --> 33:29.134
No, I didn't. And I explicitly told..

33:33.563 --> 33:35.296
Oh, my God.

33:36.299 --> 33:38.377
You tricked me.

33:38.401 --> 33:41.146
Lesson learned, baby girl.

33:41.170 --> 33:44.383
You don't sign anything
without reading it first

33:44.407 --> 33:46.473
or that's on you.

33:48.377 --> 33:51.156
Nothing means more
to you than business

33:51.180 --> 33:52.357
not even your own daughter.

33:52.381 --> 33:55.327
Why are you kicking up such a fuss?

33:55.351 --> 33:57.718
Everyone loves you again
now that you're a victim.

33:59.589 --> 34:02.356
I just made a record
deal with Pablo Money.

34:03.192 --> 34:05.270
The last thing that I am

34:05.294 --> 34:06.594
is a victim.

34:22.192 --> 34:24.536
Have you come to pay
respects to the dead?

34:24.561 --> 34:26.371
No decisions have been made yet.

34:26.396 --> 34:29.208
We're still consulting
with our attorneys.

34:29.232 --> 34:31.110
Well, with the current
climate in Hollywood..

34:31.134 --> 34:33.112
This wasn't harassment
and you know it.

34:33.136 --> 34:35.481
It was a 100% consensual relationship.

34:35.505 --> 34:37.349
- Yeah, with a minor.
- Okay, Jordan was 18.

34:37.373 --> 34:39.552
And I have his birth
certificate to prove it.

34:39.576 --> 34:41.353
Nina, I'm not the enemy here.

34:41.377 --> 34:43.222
I argued for you in that meeting.

34:43.246 --> 34:45.491
Great! But I deserve to make my case.

34:45.514 --> 34:48.293
Just let me speak to them directly.

34:48.318 --> 34:50.362
Alright, I'll-I'll,
I'll see what I can do.

34:50.386 --> 34:52.565
The board meets again next week.

34:52.589 --> 34:54.322
Thank you, Alan.

34:57.193 --> 34:59.171
Guys, you'll never
guess what's outside.

34:59.195 --> 35:01.595
Jordan Wilder just sent us a bus
to take us all to the beach.

35:08.505 --> 35:11.117
Oh, God. He's coming.

35:11.141 --> 35:13.119
No, please don't.

35:13.143 --> 35:15.409
Please don't kill me. No! No! No!

35:18.248 --> 35:19.425
That was great. That was great.

35:19.449 --> 35:22.294
Let's go one more time with
a few adjustments. Yeah?

35:22.318 --> 35:23.362
Uh, sure.

35:23.386 --> 35:25.219
Should I act more scared?

35:26.356 --> 35:27.533
I want you to, to really

35:27.557 --> 35:30.136
get into the physicality
of it this time.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.204
Right? When the pickaxe
comes down on your sister.

35:32.228 --> 35:33.305
I mean, she's practically immobile.

35:33.329 --> 35:35.141
But she's desperate.

35:35.165 --> 35:37.265
Right? Desperate to get
out of the house alive.

35:38.268 --> 35:40.546
- Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.
- Okay.

35:40.570 --> 35:42.637
Yeah, I got it.

35:46.276 --> 35:47.508
I'm ready.

35:48.344 --> 35:50.523
Suddenly, the lights go out..

35:52.382 --> 35:55.561
Lucy!

35:55.585 --> 35:59.398
Oh, Lucy.

35:59.422 --> 36:00.399
No.

36:00.423 --> 36:02.301
No, no, no, no, no.

36:02.325 --> 36:04.170
This isn't happening.

36:04.194 --> 36:05.304
It's not real.

36:05.328 --> 36:07.406
It's not real!

36:07.430 --> 36:09.475
'Now, she hears footsteps..'

36:09.499 --> 36:11.477
...closing in

36:11.501 --> 36:13.078
coming for her.

36:14.103 --> 36:16.315
Then, she sees the Phantom.

36:16.339 --> 36:20.186
No, please, please leave me alone.

36:20.210 --> 36:23.088
Please. Erica! Erica, help!

36:23.112 --> 36:25.157
Please, somebody. Please help me!

36:25.181 --> 36:27.426
He-he-he. They're all dead.

36:27.450 --> 36:30.563
No one can save you now, slut.

36:32.121 --> 36:33.499
She grabs an object

36:33.523 --> 36:36.468
throws it at the Phantom...
but misses.

36:36.492 --> 36:39.338
The Phantom drives his
pickaxe into her sister.

36:41.264 --> 36:43.664
No, please don't kill me.
Please don't.

36:44.601 --> 36:47.246
No, no, somebody help me.

36:47.270 --> 36:48.547
Somebody, please. No!

36:48.571 --> 36:50.149
No, please don't kill me.

36:50.173 --> 36:51.283
No! No!

36:51.307 --> 36:53.240
No!

37:03.453 --> 37:06.365
Um, thank you.

37:06.389 --> 37:08.167
'Thank you so much for having me.'

37:08.191 --> 37:10.257
That was really fun.

37:11.261 --> 37:13.138
You're it.

37:13.162 --> 37:15.107
You're third to die.

37:15.131 --> 37:16.330
You're my Lucy.

37:17.233 --> 37:19.245
What?

37:19.269 --> 37:21.247
S-seriously?

37:21.271 --> 37:23.148
Congratulations, Cassandra.

37:23.172 --> 37:24.516
I can't wait to kill you.

37:28.311 --> 37:30.256
Thank you.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.545
Thank you so much.

37:58.541 --> 38:00.207
Thank you.

38:30.373 --> 38:31.572
Hey.

38:32.442 --> 38:34.553
You ready to talk?

38:34.577 --> 38:37.256
Hmm, no.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.291
Well, are you hungry?

38:39.315 --> 38:41.182
Hmm, not really.

38:42.385 --> 38:44.330
If we leave now,
we can go to a meeting.

38:44.354 --> 38:45.586
No, thanks.

38:46.589 --> 38:48.400
Okay.

38:48.424 --> 38:50.191
I give up.

38:50.526 --> 38:52.593
Oh, out of ideas?

38:53.563 --> 38:55.663
- Yeah.
- I can think of one.

39:37.373 --> 39:39.473
This is an incredible house.

39:40.510 --> 39:42.443
Oh, why?

39:44.247 --> 39:46.558
We've only been seeing
each other for two months.

39:46.582 --> 39:50.129
Yeah, but we've known each
other for, like, ever.

39:50.153 --> 39:52.219
Paige, we've been fighting.

39:54.123 --> 39:55.501
And we never finished
talking about Rainer

39:55.525 --> 39:56.535
because there's never time

39:56.559 --> 39:58.170
and maybe that's why

39:58.194 --> 40:00.261
this is all feeling so rushed.

40:04.367 --> 40:07.179
We're in a good place.

40:07.203 --> 40:10.382
But when we move in together,
I want to be in a great place

40:10.406 --> 40:12.506
with all the kinks worked out.

40:16.145 --> 40:19.413
I know that you love this house.

40:23.486 --> 40:26.365
It kills me to change my mind, but..

40:30.526 --> 40:33.172
...I'm just not ready.

40:37.233 --> 40:38.499
Well, I am.

40:40.436 --> 40:41.635
With or..

40:43.239 --> 40:44.505
...without you.
