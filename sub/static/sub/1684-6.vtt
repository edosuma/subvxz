WEBVTT

00:03.028 --> 00:04.962
Lieutenant...

00:04.963 --> 00:08.064
I cannot withstand this torture.

00:08.066 --> 00:10.468
Yes, you can.

00:12.938 --> 00:15.606
Fight. Do it for Katrina.

00:17.409 --> 00:20.478
Every woman wants
their... man in good shape.

00:20.479 --> 00:24.115
And to what shape are we
laboring at the moment?

00:24.116 --> 00:28.319
We are strengthening our
arms, our abs, buns...

00:28.320 --> 00:31.122
Bun...?

00:31.890 --> 00:34.092
I find yoga neither soothing

00:34.093 --> 00:36.661
nor relaxing, made more uncomfortable still

00:36.662 --> 00:39.130
by discussion of my... double jugg.

00:39.131 --> 00:43.067
What? Okay, for the record,

00:43.068 --> 00:46.137
"double jugg"... is
much weirder than "buns."

00:46.138 --> 00:48.239
Please refrain from
further use of that word.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.308
Yoga's a very useful practice, Crane.

00:50.309 --> 00:52.910
I'm quite familiar with the pre-Vedic

00:52.911 --> 00:55.146
Indian and Asiatic traditions.

00:55.147 --> 00:57.014
- Thank you.
- Well, this is more like

00:57.015 --> 00:59.350
training for our war against Moloch.

00:59.351 --> 01:01.018
A way to still your mind.

01:01.019 --> 01:04.087
You've been anxious since you saw Katrina.

01:04.089 --> 01:06.924
What in God's name did you do?!

01:06.925 --> 01:12.163
I know why my wife hid
Mary's death from me.

01:12.164 --> 01:13.965
It's because my role as a witness

01:13.966 --> 01:15.967
was too important to compromise.

01:15.968 --> 01:17.935
Uh, Crane...

01:17.936 --> 01:19.771
it's 2014.

01:19.772 --> 01:22.140
You're pissed off, just say it.

01:22.141 --> 01:26.277
Oh. Well, yes, I am... peeved.

01:29.515 --> 01:32.350
I'm disappointed.

01:33.685 --> 01:35.486
I'm hurt.

01:35.487 --> 01:37.989
Katrina

01:37.990 --> 01:39.891
withheld too much from me.

01:39.892 --> 01:42.126
And it's hard,

01:42.127 --> 01:46.163
in good conscience, to
believe in her as I have.

01:48.967 --> 01:50.968
But...

01:50.969 --> 01:53.137
war does not permit us the luxury

01:53.138 --> 01:54.572
of dwelling on personal matters.

01:54.573 --> 02:00.177
Nor, indeed, the downward
facing of our dogs.

02:00.979 --> 02:02.980
Okay.

02:02.981 --> 02:04.982
Yoga doesn't make you feel better.

02:04.983 --> 02:06.851
What will?

02:08.419 --> 02:11.189
To George Washington,

02:11.190 --> 02:14.192
Commander of the American Armies,

02:14.193 --> 02:16.561
who, like Joshua of old,

02:16.562 --> 02:20.198
commanded the sun and moon stand still,

02:20.199 --> 02:21.866
and both obeyed.

02:21.867 --> 02:24.335
Namaste. You guys
definitely had better toasts.

02:24.336 --> 02:27.004
Oh, that one was Franklin's.

02:27.005 --> 02:29.006
Much as I begrudge his posthumous fame,

02:29.007 --> 02:32.243
the man was an unrivaled reveler.

02:32.244 --> 02:33.678
Mm!

02:33.679 --> 02:35.212
Mmm...

02:38.617 --> 02:41.385
- Clearly not the only one.
- Mmm...

02:41.386 --> 02:43.187
What are you talking about, man?
If anything, we're going again.

02:43.188 --> 02:45.857
Hey, you understand? I don't
care where the money is.

02:45.858 --> 02:48.392
I gotta handle this.

02:48.393 --> 02:50.428
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

02:50.429 --> 02:52.430
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Break it up.

02:52.431 --> 02:54.232
Joe...?

02:54.233 --> 02:56.234
Hey.

02:56.235 --> 02:57.869
Officer Mills is on the scene.

02:57.870 --> 02:59.370
Lieutenant, you're

02:59.371 --> 03:01.439
acquainted with this "runty bull"?

03:01.440 --> 03:06.210
Hey, Corbin, you're out of here, man.

03:06.211 --> 03:08.212
I was leaving anyway.

03:08.213 --> 03:10.214
Joe Corbin,

03:10.215 --> 03:11.649
as in...?

03:11.650 --> 03:13.417
Sheriff Corbin's son.

03:14.720 --> 03:17.254
Joey?!

03:22.895 --> 03:25.096
Nobody calls me that.

03:25.097 --> 03:27.932
Welcome home.

03:27.933 --> 03:30.067
- Hear you've been back almost a week.
- Yeah.

03:30.068 --> 03:31.269
Hear you never left.

03:31.270 --> 03:32.775
What happened to Quantico?

03:32.776 --> 03:34.672
You couldn't leave all this behind?

03:34.673 --> 03:36.107
If I did, who'd be here

03:36.108 --> 03:37.809
to keep you in line?

03:37.810 --> 03:39.643
You gonna arrest me, Mills?

03:45.117 --> 03:47.084
Hey, I heard about

03:47.085 --> 03:49.153
what happened with your platoon

03:49.154 --> 03:50.688
and honorable discharge.

03:50.689 --> 03:54.325
I am so sorry.

03:55.527 --> 03:58.262
You know, it's none of your business,

03:58.263 --> 04:00.331
what happened to my platoon...

04:00.332 --> 04:01.866
what happened to me.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.302
You know what?

04:04.303 --> 04:06.170
You're not my family, you're not my friend.

04:06.171 --> 04:08.105
You're some charity
case my dad took pity on,

04:08.106 --> 04:10.107
and you got him killed.

04:10.108 --> 04:13.311
There's a lot about that night
that you don't understand.

04:13.312 --> 04:14.879
All right.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.313
So explain it to me.

04:23.355 --> 04:25.489
Stay away from me.

04:54.086 --> 04:58.356
I do not recall Young Corbin
from the sheriff's funeral.

04:58.357 --> 05:02.093
He was in Afghanistan; couldn't make it.

05:02.094 --> 05:05.363
But Joe and his dad weren't on great terms.

05:05.364 --> 05:08.199
And your relationship with
him is equally fraught.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.568
Didn't used to be.

05:10.569 --> 05:12.236
I used to babysit Joe

05:12.237 --> 05:14.739
when Corbin started mentoring me.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.841
He used to wear these Superman pajamas

05:16.842 --> 05:19.744
and jump onto me from the couch, screaming,

05:19.745 --> 05:22.380
"I will save you!"

05:28.387 --> 05:31.355
Once a hero, always a hero.

05:31.356 --> 05:34.225
I'm sure Young Corbin will find his way.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.963
Superman is...

05:38.964 --> 05:41.132
Peter Parker?

05:41.133 --> 05:42.567
No, no, no, no,

05:42.568 --> 05:44.402
that's the arachnid fellow.

05:44.403 --> 05:45.870
- Do you want a hint?
- No.

05:45.871 --> 05:47.405
- Clark Kent.
- Clark Kent!

05:47.406 --> 05:49.307
I was going to say that.

05:49.308 --> 05:50.741
415, noise complaint

05:50.742 --> 05:52.410
at Pioneer Point.

05:52.411 --> 05:54.812
License plate match to Joe Corbin.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.581
Young Corbin.

05:56.582 --> 05:58.742
Lieutenant Mills. I'll take the call.

05:59.751 --> 06:02.420
Once a hero...

06:13.432 --> 06:14.832
Ah!

06:14.833 --> 06:17.435
I do believe I've won.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.115
What the holy hell was that?

06:38.290 --> 06:39.490
Lieutenant...?

06:46.465 --> 06:47.465
Over here.

07:04.116 --> 07:05.316
Crane...?

07:12.324 --> 07:14.258
Joe?

07:22.634 --> 07:24.469
Joe!

07:24.470 --> 07:25.970
Are you-you okay?

07:26.972 --> 07:28.473
It-it came...

07:28.474 --> 07:30.241
- Okay, you're all right.
- It came...

07:30.242 --> 07:31.509
It's all over now.

07:31.510 --> 07:32.410
No, no,

07:32.411 --> 07:33.478
it's just the beginning.

07:33.479 --> 07:34.712
D-Dad?

07:34.713 --> 07:37.248
Dad...? My DA... my dad knew.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.657
Your dad? What are you talking about?

07:38.658 --> 07:39.350
Joe?

07:39.351 --> 07:41.552
It's gonna kill us all.

08:25.394 --> 08:27.028
You okay?

08:27.029 --> 08:29.253
I know, I'm the last person
you want to talk to right now.

08:29.254 --> 08:31.055
So why are you here?

08:31.056 --> 08:34.392
You were the only survivor, Joe.

08:34.393 --> 08:37.727
That thing that attacked you
last night is still out there,

08:37.729 --> 08:39.530
and we need to find it
before it kills again,

08:39.530 --> 08:41.399
so you gotta work with me.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.135
You said your dad knew something?

08:44.135 --> 08:45.609
- No, I didn't.
- You said when you were...

08:45.610 --> 08:46.570
No, well, I mean, he never

08:46.571 --> 08:47.605
told me anything; why would he?

08:47.606 --> 08:48.926
He was too busy with you.

08:51.310 --> 08:53.978
- I'm trying to help you, Joe.
- Well, my dad's dead 'cause of you.

08:53.979 --> 08:56.247
I don't want your damn help.

08:59.651 --> 09:01.252
You know, I once waited five hours

09:01.253 --> 09:02.820
to go on a fishing trip with him.

09:02.821 --> 09:04.255
He was teaching you how to shoot,

09:04.256 --> 09:06.424
and he lost track of time.

09:06.425 --> 09:08.873
That was actually the night
I signed up for the Marines.

09:08.874 --> 09:11.262
I thought, "All right, he'll push me away,

09:11.263 --> 09:13.230
"I will push him right back.

09:13.231 --> 09:17.301
If I die at war, he'll
have to live with that."

09:18.770 --> 09:20.538
Only I didn't die.

09:22.841 --> 09:24.275
Well, if I, uh, remember anything,

09:24.276 --> 09:26.277
Officer Mills...

09:26.278 --> 09:27.912
I will let you know.

09:29.414 --> 09:32.483
You stole my soul.

09:34.620 --> 09:37.255
I didn't steal your soul.

09:37.256 --> 09:39.857
I bartered it for services rendered.

09:39.858 --> 09:42.260
And for that,

09:42.261 --> 09:44.295
when you die, I own you.

09:44.296 --> 09:47.265
That will never happen.

09:47.266 --> 09:49.667
I will find a way to get it back.

09:49.668 --> 09:52.270
I can tell you how to reclaim your soul,

09:52.271 --> 09:54.038
but you won't like it.

09:54.039 --> 09:55.640
Try me.

09:55.641 --> 09:57.875
You must take a life.

09:59.344 --> 10:00.878
A soul for a soul.

10:00.879 --> 10:03.159
You want me to kill an
innocent human being?

10:03.649 --> 10:05.449
I never said innocent.

10:05.450 --> 10:06.651
That's Gil Everett.

10:06.652 --> 10:09.453
Another client of mine.

10:09.454 --> 10:10.855
He was arrested three years ago

10:10.856 --> 10:12.323
for drunk driving

10:12.324 --> 10:13.858
after hitting a little girl.

10:15.494 --> 10:18.829
But you know that already, don't you?

10:19.731 --> 10:22.411
That man paralyzed my daughter.

10:23.302 --> 10:25.303
Aw, my little bean.

10:25.304 --> 10:27.471
Put her in a wheelchair
for the rest of her life.

10:27.472 --> 10:28.839
Mm-hmm.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.876
And you're telling me he
doesn't deserve to die?

10:31.877 --> 10:34.478
I'm not gonna kill for vengeance.

10:34.479 --> 10:36.380
I'm not a monster like you.

10:36.381 --> 10:38.716
Those who fight monsters should see to it

10:38.717 --> 10:41.886
that in the process,
they do not become one.

10:41.887 --> 10:44.155
When one gazes long enough

10:44.156 --> 10:46.157
into the abyss,

10:46.158 --> 10:48.492
the abyss gazes back,

10:48.493 --> 10:51.529
doesn't it, Captain?

10:52.331 --> 10:54.532
You wanted a choice.

11:01.073 --> 11:02.506
Any luck with young Corbin?

11:02.507 --> 11:04.342
The only thing he seems to remember is that

11:04.343 --> 11:06.077
he still resents the hell out of me.

11:06.078 --> 11:07.545
How about you?

11:07.546 --> 11:10.514
I've been researching modern
wood-dwelling monsters.

11:10.515 --> 11:12.383
Chupacabra, Sasquatch...

11:12.384 --> 11:14.685
one Smokey Bear.

11:14.686 --> 11:18.022
"Only you can prevent forest fires."

11:18.023 --> 11:19.523
Evidently so.

11:19.524 --> 11:21.525
And yet, none of them match

11:21.526 --> 11:25.029
the gruesome creature we
encountered at Pioneer Point.

11:25.030 --> 11:27.398
So, Master Corbin

11:27.399 --> 11:30.534
has no recollection of the creature?

11:30.535 --> 11:33.204
That's interesting.

11:33.205 --> 11:35.406
Say what's on your mind, Crane.

11:36.575 --> 11:39.377
Considering Master Corbin's odd behavior,

11:39.378 --> 11:41.445
I've been speculating as to whether

11:41.446 --> 11:43.581
he is, indeed, a mere victim.

11:43.582 --> 11:44.804
What "odd behavior"?

11:44.805 --> 11:46.817
He said his father knew something of this.

11:46.818 --> 11:50.588
Sheriff Corbin, devoted
follower of the occult.

11:50.589 --> 11:52.957
He was calling to his
dad in a moment of trauma.

11:52.958 --> 11:55.059
Soldiers cry for their
mothers, not their fathers.

11:55.060 --> 11:56.827
Is that a hard and fast rule?

11:56.828 --> 11:58.396
It is simply what dying men do.

11:58.397 --> 12:01.432
It is odd to cry for one's father.

12:01.433 --> 12:03.895
It is odder still to walk
away with barely a scratch

12:03.896 --> 12:06.470
when your comrades are maimed and mauled.

12:06.471 --> 12:08.472
Joe's C.O. sent an incident report

12:08.473 --> 12:10.775
from Afghanistan. Let's see if there are

12:10.776 --> 12:12.943
any similarities.

12:12.944 --> 12:16.614
The source of the attack
on his platoon is unknown.

12:16.615 --> 12:19.617
"Joe Corbin was the sole survivor."

12:19.618 --> 12:23.287
One of the soldier's bodies
was hollowed of its organs.

12:23.288 --> 12:25.623
The man we found in the woods.

12:25.624 --> 12:27.858
His body was also hollowed.

12:27.859 --> 12:30.795
So, this monster... takes human organs.

12:30.796 --> 12:32.430
Or consumes them.

12:32.431 --> 12:35.499
In 1778...

12:35.500 --> 12:37.435
a Shawnee tribe engaged
in a hunting expedition

12:37.436 --> 12:39.437
led by a close friend of mine

12:39.438 --> 12:41.038
- Daniel Boone...
- "Daniel Boone"...

12:41.039 --> 12:43.107
as in the guy with the raccoon on his head.

12:43.108 --> 12:45.543
How is it that the man who settled Kentucky

12:45.544 --> 12:47.445
is remembered by the modern world

12:47.446 --> 12:50.014
as "the guy with the raccoon on his head"?

12:50.015 --> 12:52.016
Probably because he wore
a raccoon on his head.

12:52.017 --> 12:53.551
Well, very rarely.

12:53.552 --> 12:55.453
Daniel much preferred beaver pelt.

12:55.454 --> 12:57.621
As much as I would love
to debate the variety

12:57.622 --> 12:59.457
of rodent hats that existed in your days,

12:59.458 --> 13:01.192
can we please refocus?

13:01.193 --> 13:04.195
Daniel's brother, Squire Boone,

13:04.196 --> 13:07.064
suffered from nostalgia after the winter

13:07.065 --> 13:08.666
- at Valley Forge.
- "Nostalgia"?

13:08.667 --> 13:11.535
It is when a soldier loses
the ability to see anything

13:11.536 --> 13:13.189
beyond the horrors of war.

13:13.190 --> 13:14.676
We call that "post-traumatic stress."

13:14.677 --> 13:16.674
I know.

13:16.675 --> 13:19.477
You guys have much better
words for mental illness, too.

13:19.478 --> 13:22.346
Valley Forge turned good men into beasts.

13:22.347 --> 13:25.082
Some even stooped to
cannibalism in their desperation.

13:25.083 --> 13:26.884
Rumor told...

13:26.885 --> 13:28.486
Squire Boone was among them.

13:28.487 --> 13:30.688
Even attacked his own brother.

13:30.689 --> 13:33.891
So, "the guy with the raccoon on his head,"

13:33.892 --> 13:37.695
he only wore it to cover the scars.

13:37.696 --> 13:39.063
Daniel lived with the Shawnee

13:39.064 --> 13:40.498
for a year,

13:40.499 --> 13:42.500
believing they held the cure

13:42.501 --> 13:44.535
to his brother's ailment.

13:44.536 --> 13:46.504
Yes...

13:46.505 --> 13:49.073
He once told me what he believed to be

13:49.074 --> 13:52.843
the origin of his brother's affliction.

13:52.844 --> 13:54.512
"Curse of the Wendigo."

13:54.513 --> 13:57.915
A skin-walker from Shawnee
and Algonquian legend,

13:57.916 --> 14:00.851
which possesses both human
and bestial attributes

14:00.852 --> 14:03.454
and partakes in the act of cannibalism.

14:03.455 --> 14:06.691
"Its feeding is triggered
by its lust for human blood."

14:06.692 --> 14:08.059
"Once the appetite is triggered,

14:08.060 --> 14:09.587
"the transformation begins.

14:10.130 --> 14:11.033
"The beast can only

14:11.034 --> 14:12.596
"return to human form

14:12.597 --> 14:15.599
after the consumption of human organs."

14:15.600 --> 14:16.534
"Return to human form."

14:19.604 --> 14:22.907
That means Joe Corbin is the Wendigo.

14:25.110 --> 14:27.545
We gotta get to the hospital.

14:30.549 --> 14:32.750
Mills.

14:34.553 --> 14:37.488
Thank you.

14:37.489 --> 14:39.690
Joe's gone.

14:45.597 --> 14:47.798
Thank you.

14:50.135 --> 14:53.103
Joe didn't exactly settle in.

14:54.573 --> 14:56.407
There's nothing in the kitchen.

14:56.408 --> 14:59.777
Just some spoiled meat in the fridge.

14:59.778 --> 15:02.780
And some ketchup and hamburger buns.

15:03.582 --> 15:05.716
Sorry, hamburger "double juggs."

15:10.756 --> 15:11.922
What is this?

15:11.923 --> 15:13.024
It's a video game.

15:13.025 --> 15:15.126
People play it to relax, unwind...

15:15.127 --> 15:16.694
You'd probably like it better than yoga.

15:16.695 --> 15:18.796
It's easier on your liver than beer.

15:18.797 --> 15:20.831
These unwinding activities...

15:20.832 --> 15:24.602
your yoga, your video games...

15:24.603 --> 15:26.370
they miss the purpose of relaxation.

15:26.371 --> 15:29.640
"The grass does not try to grow.

15:29.641 --> 15:31.375
The water does not try to flow..."

15:31.376 --> 15:34.378
Yeah, well, Lao Tzu never
had to hunt down a Wendigo.

15:34.379 --> 15:36.147
Well...

15:36.148 --> 15:38.015
Crane...

15:38.951 --> 15:42.153
Sheriff Corbin's last will and testament.

15:44.790 --> 15:47.358
"Son, there is much about this world

15:47.359 --> 15:49.627
- that you don't know..."
- "Now that I'm gone

15:49.628 --> 15:51.662
"there are a few valuable and rare items

15:51.663 --> 15:54.031
"I need you to protect. This has been...

15:54.032 --> 15:56.667
...my mantle and now I pass it on to you."

15:56.668 --> 15:58.869
"You're ready."

16:04.743 --> 16:07.311
These numbers aren't accurate.

16:07.312 --> 16:08.713
The wrong address, wrong birthday.

16:08.714 --> 16:10.414
Oh, it's a code.

16:10.415 --> 16:13.184
Joe must've known that these
numbers meant something else.

16:15.053 --> 16:16.954
Longitude and latitude.

16:22.494 --> 16:24.695
"Pioneer Point."

16:26.765 --> 16:29.033
Of course.

16:29.034 --> 16:30.101
Young Corbin was not in the woods

16:30.102 --> 16:32.236
as a Wendigo looking for prey.

16:32.237 --> 16:33.671
He was searching for something.

16:33.672 --> 16:36.073
And his father led him there.

17:06.819 --> 17:09.220
Joe!

17:10.499 --> 17:12.300
We know what's going on with you.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.135
- We can help.
- No, you can't!

17:14.136 --> 17:16.816
Look, I told you... stay away from me!

17:18.073 --> 17:20.540
Joe!

17:42.531 --> 17:44.465
Run!

18:08.457 --> 18:09.757
Lieutenant!

18:16.732 --> 18:19.433
Shoot it!

18:28.143 --> 18:29.610
Crane!

18:44.593 --> 18:46.728
You had me

18:46.729 --> 18:49.564
at "secret Masonic cell," but this...

18:49.565 --> 18:50.598
I got your attention?

18:51.934 --> 18:54.482
You said you had some ideas for a cure.

18:54.483 --> 18:55.649
That was before I knew

18:55.650 --> 18:57.117
Wendi-Joe was your friend.

18:57.118 --> 18:58.919
Most of my cures are ways to kill it.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.887
This is gonna require

19:00.888 --> 19:02.956
more creative brainstorming.

19:02.957 --> 19:04.658
Great.

19:04.659 --> 19:06.259
We're gonna figure it out, Mills.

19:07.362 --> 19:09.062
Yeah.

19:10.198 --> 19:11.932
We have to.

19:16.371 --> 19:18.472
So, the med school

19:18.473 --> 19:20.807
needs to up their game
on the security front.

19:20.808 --> 19:22.576
Pulled from the freshest
cadaver I could find.

19:22.577 --> 19:24.035
But the pickings were slim.

19:24.036 --> 19:26.313
That being said, we should
probably donate blood

19:26.314 --> 19:28.515
or something this year.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.427
He's gonna need these.

20:13.428 --> 20:16.563
I'm gonna go jump on
researching Wendigo cures.

20:17.799 --> 20:18.865
Never a dull moment.

20:28.209 --> 20:29.843
Jenny?

20:41.456 --> 20:42.789
What's going on?

20:42.790 --> 20:44.624
You turned into a Wendigo.

20:47.095 --> 20:48.996
A monster.

20:48.997 --> 20:52.266
So, that horrible thing
I turn into has a name?

20:52.267 --> 20:53.433
How could you know that?

20:53.434 --> 20:55.235
I told you.

20:55.236 --> 20:56.803
I know about this stuff.

20:56.804 --> 20:58.805
Look around.

21:07.181 --> 21:09.049
I can help you, Joe.

21:10.251 --> 21:11.785
The other night at the bar...

21:11.786 --> 21:12.931
I stopped there on the way

21:12.932 --> 21:14.379
to Pioneer Point, to hit the head.

21:14.380 --> 21:16.801
I ran into a couple of friends.
I agreed to have one drink.

21:16.802 --> 21:17.869
One turned into two.

21:17.870 --> 21:19.871
I thought maybe what happened

21:19.872 --> 21:21.755
in Afghanistan might happen to me again,

21:21.756 --> 21:22.874
but I didn't even know what that was.

21:22.875 --> 21:23.909
I didn't know how or when.

21:23.910 --> 21:25.410
I didn't...

21:25.411 --> 21:26.812
You know, I didn't realize,

21:26.813 --> 21:28.046
until after Pioneer Point,

21:28.047 --> 21:29.487
that blood was the trigger.

21:37.423 --> 21:38.890
How did this happen, Joe?

21:38.891 --> 21:40.492
Two weeks ago.

21:40.493 --> 21:43.261
In Afghanistan.

21:43.262 --> 21:46.965
I get this weird letter,
covered in white powder.

21:46.966 --> 21:47.966
Human bone.

21:47.967 --> 21:49.901
Of course.

21:49.902 --> 21:52.904
Ground to a dust and
hexed with black magic.

21:52.905 --> 21:56.641
It's how some Shawnee
believe the curse originated.

21:56.642 --> 21:58.643
Like a supernatural anthrax.

21:58.644 --> 22:00.111
The letter said I'd been cursed,

22:00.112 --> 22:02.581
and that the only way to get rid of it

22:02.582 --> 22:04.015
was to trade it for this...

22:04.016 --> 22:06.084
item my dad left for me.

22:06.085 --> 22:07.352
Your inheritance.

22:07.353 --> 22:08.954
- We went to your apartment.
- Well...

22:08.955 --> 22:10.489
I thought it was bogus

22:10.490 --> 22:13.258
and someone was screwing with me, until...

22:13.259 --> 22:15.093
I went out with my platoon that night.

22:15.094 --> 22:17.496
And I, uh...

22:20.133 --> 22:21.967
...I changed for the first time.

22:21.968 --> 22:24.336
Then you returned home, you retrieved

22:24.337 --> 22:25.537
your inheritance...

22:25.538 --> 22:27.606
- That's why you were cursed.
- With whom

22:27.607 --> 22:29.508
- were you to make this trade?
- I still don't know.

22:29.509 --> 22:30.873
There was no information on the letter.

22:30.874 --> 22:32.110
There was just a return address

22:32.111 --> 22:33.678
for a place called, um...

22:33.679 --> 22:36.348
"Frederick's Manor."

22:36.349 --> 22:38.316
Henry Parish sent that curse.

22:40.319 --> 22:42.053
But why? Why would he do it?

22:42.054 --> 22:43.388
Because Henry desperately desires

22:43.389 --> 22:45.957
whatever's in that box.

22:45.958 --> 22:48.526
It must be a part of his greater plan.

22:59.338 --> 23:01.540
It's Jincan.

23:01.541 --> 23:02.808
You want to share

23:02.809 --> 23:04.142
with the class?

23:04.143 --> 23:05.143
What the hell is Jincan?

23:05.144 --> 23:06.978
Jincan is an incredibly powerful

23:06.979 --> 23:08.513
poison from southern China.

23:08.514 --> 23:10.582
The deadliest creatures

23:10.583 --> 23:13.151
are sealed in a solitary utensil

23:13.152 --> 23:15.020
and devour one another

23:15.021 --> 23:17.322
until their banes are concentrated

23:17.323 --> 23:19.024
into a single toxin.

23:19.025 --> 23:21.526
Cute.

23:22.826 --> 23:25.092
Soon, Henry's gonna
realize that Joe is missing

23:25.093 --> 23:26.164
and that we have him.

23:26.165 --> 23:27.999
And the Jincan along with him.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.734
We can't move Joe without a cure.

23:29.735 --> 23:31.570
Then we'd better find a cure... quickly...

23:31.571 --> 23:33.772
before Henry finds us.

23:43.165 --> 23:45.125
I wanted to apologize.

23:45.534 --> 23:47.669
The man who cursed you, Henry Parish,

23:47.670 --> 23:49.270
is my son.

23:49.271 --> 23:51.106
Needless to say, he's going through

23:51.107 --> 23:52.474
a rebellious phase.

23:52.475 --> 23:54.709
You a soldier?

23:54.710 --> 23:56.211
You have the, uh...

23:56.212 --> 23:59.147
the posture.

23:59.148 --> 24:01.716
I am.

24:01.717 --> 24:05.854
I fight in the war to which
your father gave his life.

24:05.855 --> 24:09.190
Which is why, though it pains me to say,

24:09.191 --> 24:11.993
we cannot trust my son with your cure.

24:11.994 --> 24:13.528
You love your son?

24:15.297 --> 24:17.498
In spite of everything, yes.

24:19.168 --> 24:20.802
I do.

24:20.803 --> 24:22.570
Well, then, do me a favor.

24:22.571 --> 24:26.307
No matter what happens to me...

24:26.308 --> 24:28.543
tell him.

24:40.723 --> 24:42.357
- Progress?
- No.

24:42.358 --> 24:44.526
Nothing on the cure. I did, however,

24:44.527 --> 24:47.195
stumble upon this disturbing little tidbit.

24:47.196 --> 24:49.731
"Like the cycle of the seasons,

24:49.732 --> 24:53.535
"the Wendigoas four transformations.

24:53.536 --> 24:56.337
The last is permanent."

24:56.338 --> 24:58.039
Joe has transformed three times already.

24:58.040 --> 25:01.342
So the next change will be eternal.

25:01.343 --> 25:03.178
We have to find that cure.

25:03.179 --> 25:05.013
Did you try to get in touch with Katrina?

25:05.014 --> 25:06.381
Without Katrina's familiar,

25:06.382 --> 25:08.216
communication is impossible.

25:08.217 --> 25:10.016
And in any case, I don't know

25:10.017 --> 25:12.353
if Katrina had relations with the Shawnee.

25:12.354 --> 25:15.223
Ooh...

25:15.224 --> 25:16.624
I, uh...

25:16.625 --> 25:18.393
I might know some Shawnee.

25:18.394 --> 25:21.930
Couple guys I trade with
from time to time; I mean...

25:21.931 --> 25:24.966
we could ask them for help, but...

25:24.967 --> 25:26.267
they're not easy, okay?

25:26.268 --> 25:28.603
I know the Shawnee culture well.

25:28.604 --> 25:31.239
They respect quality
of character above coin.

25:31.240 --> 25:34.375
Perhaps that's why you
encountered conflict.

25:34.376 --> 25:36.077
All right, Crane.

25:36.078 --> 25:38.046
- Go with Hawley.
- Oh, must I?

25:38.047 --> 25:39.414
- I don't think...
- You must and I do.

25:39.415 --> 25:40.782
We need all hands on deck if we're gonna

25:40.783 --> 25:42.150
beat Henry to the cure.

25:45.955 --> 25:47.255
Okay...

25:47.256 --> 25:49.290
Big Ash is the tree trunk over there.

25:49.291 --> 25:50.425
Put someone in the hospital

25:50.426 --> 25:52.594
last week for staring at his dog.

25:52.595 --> 25:54.044
I'm on okay terms with these guys,

25:54.045 --> 25:55.330
so just let me do the talking.

25:55.331 --> 25:57.398
- Big Ash!
- Heard you traded

25:57.399 --> 25:59.434
the tribal mask we sold you.

25:59.435 --> 26:00.769
Tribal mask? I...

26:00.770 --> 26:02.403
Oh, right, the, uh...

26:02.404 --> 26:03.638
Sisuro transformation mask.

26:03.639 --> 26:05.774
You know, waterfront property,

26:05.775 --> 26:06.872
it ain't cheap.

26:06.873 --> 26:08.309
I sold you that on the condition

26:08.310 --> 26:10.779
that you keep it.

26:10.780 --> 26:11.913
- But you didn't.
- Ash...

26:11.914 --> 26:13.415
Uh, Big Ash... Big Ash?

26:13.416 --> 26:14.783
Big Ash.

26:14.784 --> 26:17.118
Mr. Hawley will find and retrieve

26:17.119 --> 26:20.422
your sacred mask that
he so callously traded,

26:20.423 --> 26:23.291
if you assist us in finding a Wendigo cure.

26:23.292 --> 26:24.859
Wendigos don't exist.

26:24.860 --> 26:26.461
I would agree...

26:26.462 --> 26:27.929
were it not for that

26:27.930 --> 26:30.632
red fox foot totem over there.

26:30.633 --> 26:32.434
Representative of

26:32.435 --> 26:35.236
the Appalachians from
whence you hail, is it not?

26:36.639 --> 26:39.707
Yes, this is a Shawnee hunting party.

26:39.708 --> 26:41.042
And the owner

26:41.043 --> 26:43.144
of that single-person automobile

26:43.145 --> 26:45.513
is your shaman.

26:46.382 --> 26:48.349
That would be Frank.

26:48.350 --> 26:51.052
I see.

26:51.053 --> 26:54.289
Come, Mr. Hawley, the Shawnee
could not help Squire Boone.

26:54.290 --> 26:56.357
What makes you think they would help us?

26:56.358 --> 26:59.527
How do you know about Squire Boone?

26:59.528 --> 27:00.528
Excellent question.

27:00.529 --> 27:01.896
How I know is not important.

27:01.897 --> 27:04.299
But another soldier has been cursed.

27:04.300 --> 27:05.900
Help us.

27:06.669 --> 27:08.109
Please.

27:09.371 --> 27:10.672
Hey, Frank!

27:10.673 --> 27:13.041
There's some people
here that need your help.

27:16.312 --> 27:18.346
Unbelievable.

27:27.690 --> 27:29.157
Hmm.

27:29.158 --> 27:30.525
What?

27:30.526 --> 27:31.559
You pierced your ear.

27:31.560 --> 27:32.861
You used to hate needles.

27:32.862 --> 27:34.329
Yeah, I still do.

27:34.330 --> 27:36.164
I... I didn't even want to do it.

27:36.165 --> 27:38.845
It was Dave's dumb idea.

27:39.168 --> 27:40.502
Doesn't matter.

27:40.503 --> 27:42.670
Of course it does.

27:42.671 --> 27:44.339
When your dad first arrested me,

27:44.340 --> 27:46.574
wanted me to turn my life around,

27:46.575 --> 27:48.343
I wanted to give up, too.

27:48.344 --> 27:50.545
Yeah, but he did the whole pie-soup gag

27:50.546 --> 27:51.913
and you decided to change, right?

27:51.914 --> 27:55.650
Okay. Heard that story
about a zillion times.

27:56.552 --> 27:59.354
Well, part of me...

27:59.355 --> 28:02.557
wanted to change that night, yes.

28:02.558 --> 28:05.560
But most of me just
didn't want to go to jail.

28:08.597 --> 28:10.598
So what made you decide to change?

28:10.599 --> 28:13.368
Finished alphabetizing

28:13.369 --> 28:15.904
the cold case files.

28:15.905 --> 28:17.806
I'm starting to think I
should've picked juvie.

28:17.807 --> 28:19.374
Ah, patience, Miss Mills.

28:19.375 --> 28:21.976
It's a virtue that'll serve you well.

28:21.977 --> 28:24.212
Thank you, Mr. Miyagi. Can I go home now?

28:24.213 --> 28:25.380
No, not yet.

28:25.381 --> 28:27.215
I have some evidence files

28:27.216 --> 28:30.585
in need of your organizational skills.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.327
You ever play ball with your old man?

28:39.328 --> 28:41.563
I have a pick-up game later,

28:41.564 --> 28:43.131
that I am dreading.

28:43.132 --> 28:44.399
One-on-one against my son.

28:44.400 --> 28:48.336
He will school me mercilessly.

28:48.337 --> 28:49.404
He's only nine.

28:49.405 --> 28:52.040
Here. Look.

28:53.442 --> 28:55.643
He likes Superman.

28:55.644 --> 28:57.178
He is Superman.

28:57.179 --> 28:58.646
He doesn't know it yet,

28:58.647 --> 29:00.281
but he's the kind of kid who'll do whatever

29:00.282 --> 29:02.617
he sets his mind to.

29:02.618 --> 29:05.253
There's gold in him, I swear it.

29:05.254 --> 29:07.188
That's what made me change.

29:07.189 --> 29:09.824
I wanted to be a part of that.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.460
You know, I always felt like

29:12.461 --> 29:14.541
there was something wrong with me.

29:17.266 --> 29:19.267
It was like I wasn't enough for him or...

29:19.268 --> 29:21.169
No, Joe.

29:21.170 --> 29:22.437
He just had such a big heart

29:22.438 --> 29:24.172
he couldn't stop helping people.

29:24.173 --> 29:25.540
That's just who he was.

29:25.541 --> 29:30.211
You have to know he was crazy about you.

29:30.212 --> 29:30.987
And so proud.

29:30.988 --> 29:32.881
That's why he passed you the torch.

29:32.882 --> 29:34.783
You're his son.

29:34.784 --> 29:36.985
You were his world.

29:38.521 --> 29:40.522
I miss him, you know?

29:40.523 --> 29:42.657
I do, too.

29:44.193 --> 29:46.061
No matter how bad it got between you guys,

29:46.062 --> 29:48.863
he always loved you.

29:48.864 --> 29:50.565
And never gave up on you,

29:50.566 --> 29:52.700
not for a second.

29:55.638 --> 29:57.839
Neither will I.

30:00.851 --> 30:02.477
During the Revolution,

30:02.478 --> 30:04.346
prison structures like this

30:04.347 --> 30:06.481
had a sentry at every post.

30:06.482 --> 30:09.484
The hexes in this cell may limit my powers,

30:09.485 --> 30:11.586
but they do nothing for
those antiquated locks.

30:14.690 --> 30:15.970
I'm here for the Jincan.

30:17.026 --> 30:18.626
Never heard of it.

30:21.664 --> 30:24.499
Save your lies, Witness.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.668
Joe Corbin is my servant.

30:26.669 --> 30:27.869
I know he found it.

30:28.838 --> 30:30.371
Drop it.

30:31.173 --> 30:33.241
What a marvelous family gathering.

30:33.242 --> 30:34.843
Lower your guns. Now.

30:34.844 --> 30:37.524
Violence.

30:38.247 --> 30:40.682
Always violence or order with you two.

30:40.683 --> 30:43.385
In the interest of
avoiding a total bloodbath,

30:43.386 --> 30:46.154
I suggest you give me the Jincan.

30:49.926 --> 30:53.295
Fine.

30:53.296 --> 30:54.763
A bloodbath it is.

30:56.732 --> 30:58.400
Stop.

30:58.401 --> 31:00.735
If I get you the Jincan,
will you leave them alone?

31:00.736 --> 31:02.737
No. Do not help him, Joe.

31:02.738 --> 31:04.072
Fine.

31:04.073 --> 31:06.308
I'll honor your request.

31:06.309 --> 31:08.743
But first, get me the Jincan.

31:22.725 --> 31:24.926
Remarkable.

31:26.095 --> 31:27.796
Now come with me and get your cure.

31:27.797 --> 31:30.632
Oh, she won't find you one.

31:30.633 --> 31:32.567
She'll keep you chained up

31:32.568 --> 31:33.999
in here for the rest of your life,

31:34.000 --> 31:35.604
insisting it's for your own protection.

31:35.605 --> 31:38.573
But Abigail Mills can protect you

31:38.574 --> 31:40.654
no more than she could your father.

31:42.912 --> 31:45.232
- He has the cure, I have to...
- Do not go, Joe!

32:05.368 --> 32:09.871
Are you ready for your cure?

32:13.276 --> 32:15.544
You said you'd cure me.

32:16.812 --> 32:18.580
I did.

32:19.982 --> 32:22.651
Your true curse is humanity.

32:22.652 --> 32:25.687
Now Abigail will see you
for what you truly are:

32:25.688 --> 32:29.557
a creature of war.

32:42.860 --> 32:44.527
Illegal use of the hands...

32:44.528 --> 32:46.077
on the offense.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.168
- My name is Frank Irving.
- I know who you are.

32:51.169 --> 32:53.437
I remember you from the trial.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.839
You the police captain.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.774
Not anymore.

32:57.775 --> 33:00.296
You ruined my life,

33:00.297 --> 33:01.764
my marriage.

33:02.447 --> 33:04.347
My baby girl, she'll never walk again.

33:04.348 --> 33:06.564
She'll never have kids.

33:06.565 --> 33:07.999
It was dumb, man.

33:10.336 --> 33:11.703
"It was dumb."

33:13.372 --> 33:15.373
I know I used to fantasize

33:15.374 --> 33:19.344
about you breaking into my house.

33:19.345 --> 33:21.846
I'd be within my rights to kill you.

33:21.847 --> 33:23.181
Look at me, Everett.

33:23.182 --> 33:24.847
I don't want to kill you anymore.

33:24.848 --> 33:27.185
I just want to make it right.

33:27.186 --> 33:32.057
I want to know that you are
sorry for what you've done.

33:32.058 --> 33:33.191
Yeah, man.

33:33.192 --> 33:35.393
Uh... I'm sorry.

33:36.195 --> 33:37.228
About, uh...

33:37.229 --> 33:39.197
about hurting Marcy.

33:39.198 --> 33:41.266
- Macey.
- Yeah, Macey, Marcy.

33:41.267 --> 33:42.267
Yeah, whatever.

33:42.268 --> 33:43.708
Not "whatever."

33:44.236 --> 33:45.403
That's my daughter.

33:45.404 --> 33:47.072
What do you want from me, man?

33:47.073 --> 33:48.373
Huh?

33:48.374 --> 33:50.208
She ruined my life, too.

33:50.209 --> 33:52.310
You were drunk, driving on the sidewalk,

33:52.311 --> 33:54.312
you son of a bitch.

33:54.313 --> 33:57.248
Yeah, and now I'm stuck in this hellhole.

33:57.249 --> 34:00.418
All because some cop's kid was...

34:00.419 --> 34:02.499
too stupid to get out of the way.

34:07.426 --> 34:10.161
Those who fight monsters should see to it

34:10.161 --> 34:12.063
that in the process

34:12.063 --> 34:13.831
they do not become one.

34:14.967 --> 34:17.435
No. No, this is what he wants.

34:28.781 --> 34:30.348
Lieutenant!

34:30.349 --> 34:31.900
Are you all right? What happened?

34:31.900 --> 34:33.027
Henry ambushed us.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.469
He took the Jincan and left with Joe.

34:34.469 --> 34:35.540
Did you find a cure?

34:35.541 --> 34:38.109
Yes, we must recite a
Shawnee ceremonial chant

34:38.110 --> 34:41.310
- engraved on this human skull.
- That's simple enough.

34:41.311 --> 34:43.846
Over the blood of the cursed,

34:43.847 --> 34:46.447
procured by this obsidian knife.

34:46.449 --> 34:48.235
"The blood of the cursed,"
as in Joe Corbin's blood?

34:48.235 --> 34:49.284
Or the Wendigo's.

34:49.284 --> 34:51.954
Oh, no, no... no one said
anything about Wendigo blood.

34:51.955 --> 34:54.150
Big Ash and I discussed it at length.

34:54.152 --> 34:56.754
And, oh! Look, it's written
on the side of this skull.

34:56.755 --> 34:58.107
We get it, you're fluent in Shawnee,

34:58.108 --> 34:59.641
Mr. "Dances with Wendigos."

34:59.642 --> 35:01.809
But if the kid's already
gone big, white and horny...

35:01.810 --> 35:04.873
antlery... whatever.

35:04.874 --> 35:06.837
If the kid's already turned...

35:06.901 --> 35:08.936
And we can effect the cure
before his next kill...

35:08.937 --> 35:11.188
Then the curse can still be broken.

35:11.189 --> 35:13.190
Unless we're too late.

35:13.191 --> 35:14.525
I want to save him, too, Abbie,

35:14.526 --> 35:15.793
but we got to be prepared.

35:15.794 --> 35:17.294
If it is too late,

35:17.295 --> 35:20.031
then this same knife, thrust
into the beast's chest,

35:20.032 --> 35:22.433
will end it.

35:22.434 --> 35:24.201
We won't be too late.

35:24.202 --> 35:25.736
We will save him, we have to.

35:35.329 --> 35:36.363
Give me the knife.

35:36.364 --> 35:37.964
Lieutenant.

35:37.965 --> 35:39.088
What are you doing?

35:39.089 --> 35:40.910
He'll catch the scent.

35:40.911 --> 35:42.736
I can lead him into the alleyway.

35:42.737 --> 35:44.204
No, we'll lead him.

35:46.974 --> 35:48.508
Because I'm coming with you.

35:48.509 --> 35:50.810
My son did this to your friend.

35:50.811 --> 35:52.546
I must help to make it right.

35:56.848 --> 35:58.125
Got to move.

36:02.223 --> 36:04.424
Joe!

36:05.226 --> 36:07.127
Joe!

36:08.362 --> 36:09.362
Joe!

36:12.033 --> 36:13.366
Joe?

36:16.418 --> 36:18.152
Run.

36:25.828 --> 36:29.163
It's like you said, in
case things go south.

36:33.269 --> 36:35.303
So, how long you in town for?

36:35.304 --> 36:37.272
Haven't really thought about it.

36:37.273 --> 36:39.307
That's right, not so good
with hellos and good-byes.

36:39.308 --> 36:41.876
I follow the financial prospects, Mills.

36:41.877 --> 36:43.444
Didn't know that bothered you.

36:43.445 --> 36:45.322
Must be some pretty elusive prospects.

36:45.323 --> 36:47.004
You usually get what you want by now.

36:50.686 --> 36:52.019
Get ready.

37:00.663 --> 37:01.896
Hey...

37:01.897 --> 37:03.598
Hey!

37:13.909 --> 37:16.277
Crane!

37:22.302 --> 37:24.646
_

37:24.797 --> 37:28.795
_

37:29.047 --> 37:31.339
_

37:32.079 --> 37:35.299
_

37:38.500 --> 37:41.502
Finish the incantation, Crane.

37:41.503 --> 37:43.905
I did.

37:43.906 --> 37:45.506
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

37:45.507 --> 37:46.741
We're too late.

37:52.439 --> 37:55.040
Lieutenant, you know what we have to do.

37:55.041 --> 37:56.442
No. Not yet!

37:56.443 --> 37:58.916
- You must let him go.
- He's not gone.

37:58.917 --> 38:00.212
He can't be. I can't lose him.

38:00.213 --> 38:02.261
He just needs a little
bit more time, Crane.

38:02.262 --> 38:03.809
Lieutenant, we're out of time.

38:03.810 --> 38:05.009
Joey, please.

38:05.978 --> 38:07.379
Come back.

38:07.380 --> 38:09.013
Lieutenant!

38:19.892 --> 38:21.259
It worked.

38:28.234 --> 38:30.635
You made it.

38:41.847 --> 38:43.214
This is it.

38:43.215 --> 38:45.416
Home base.

38:55.227 --> 38:59.597
I thought my Dad's hobbies were
fishing and crossword puzzles.

39:01.434 --> 39:03.234
Guess I underestimated him.

39:04.904 --> 39:06.471
You shotten herring!

39:06.472 --> 39:08.240
You are a scurvy louse.

39:08.241 --> 39:09.874
You are a slop bucket.

39:09.875 --> 39:14.045
You are a puss sludge, no
good, by-blow pair of...

39:14.046 --> 39:15.947
buns!

39:15.948 --> 39:17.682
Are you gaming online?

39:19.552 --> 39:21.887
I'm not entirely sure.

39:21.888 --> 39:23.989
One thing I know is that my allies and I

39:23.990 --> 39:26.658
had just obliterated the
largest horde of rabid zombies

39:26.659 --> 39:27.893
I'd ever encountered,

39:27.894 --> 39:30.061
and then, suddenly, out of nowhere...

39:30.062 --> 39:34.099
"ChiefWiggum49" and "Haloismybitch12"

39:34.100 --> 39:35.834
decided to frag me.

39:38.638 --> 39:41.773
I, uh, got one more thing,
if you have a moment.

39:43.142 --> 39:45.822
Kind of a huge favor to ask you.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.681
Name it.

39:50.917 --> 39:53.018
My dad died protecting people.

39:53.019 --> 39:54.953
Protecting us.

39:54.954 --> 39:57.604
I'd like to carry on that
torch, if you'll help me.

39:58.906 --> 40:00.807
Would you write a letter of recommendation

40:00.808 --> 40:02.492
for me, to Quantico?

40:05.298 --> 40:07.999
They'd be lucky to have you, Joey Corbin.

40:09.268 --> 40:12.137
I gotta go. Uh...

40:12.138 --> 40:13.705
See you soon, yeah?

40:16.375 --> 40:18.375
Mm-hmm.

40:24.884 --> 40:26.151
Mills.

40:26.152 --> 40:28.620
You're my one call for a long time.

40:28.621 --> 40:30.622
Irving? What's wrong?

40:30.623 --> 40:32.202
Henry owns my soul.

40:32.203 --> 40:34.059
What? He can't. How is that possible?

40:34.060 --> 40:35.994
I tried to kill a man.

40:35.995 --> 40:38.330
And the screwed-up part is...

40:38.331 --> 40:39.965
I wish I had.

40:39.966 --> 40:44.035
Whatever he has done
to you, we will undo it.

40:44.036 --> 40:45.837
There's nothing to undo, Abbie.

40:45.838 --> 40:47.138
It's already done.

40:47.139 --> 40:48.974
Do not let him do this to you.

40:48.975 --> 40:50.308
You are a good man.

40:50.309 --> 40:53.845
Even God thought the Devil was beautiful...

40:53.846 --> 40:55.013
before he fell.

40:55.014 --> 40:56.982
We'll fix this.

40:56.983 --> 40:58.383
Frank?

40:58.384 --> 41:01.153
Henry will pay for what he's done.

41:01.154 --> 41:02.988
I trust you, Abbie.

41:02.989 --> 41:05.190
Please don't let me down.

41:11.764 --> 41:15.000
Henry owns Irving's soul.

41:15.001 --> 41:17.892
Henry cursed Joe Corbin, stole the Jincan.

41:17.893 --> 41:20.154
I don't know what he's planning,
but he has to be stopped.

41:20.155 --> 41:22.107
You're right.

41:22.108 --> 41:25.210
Henry has done unspeakable,
horrible things.

41:25.211 --> 41:28.547
And no doubt there's more he has planned.

41:28.548 --> 41:33.351
But Katrina believes there is
some good somewhere inside him.

41:33.352 --> 41:35.453
What are you saying Crane?

41:35.454 --> 41:38.456
You never gave up on
Joe Corbin, Lieutenant.

41:38.457 --> 41:40.192
Even when he was a creature,

41:40.193 --> 41:42.461
cursed to the point of no return,

41:42.462 --> 41:45.030
when everyone believed
he was beyond saving,

41:45.031 --> 41:46.598
you fought for him.

41:46.599 --> 41:48.900
And now...

41:48.901 --> 41:51.069
I must fight for my son.
