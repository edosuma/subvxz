WEBVTT

00:04.604 --> 00:08.507
Nostradamus:
<i>Since mary, queen of scotland,</i>
<i>was a child,</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:12.011
<i>The english wanted her country</i>
<i>and her crown.</i>

00:13.513 --> 00:16.281
<i>She is sent to France</i>
<i>to wed its next king,</i>

00:16.283 --> 00:18.117
To save herself and her people,

00:18.119 --> 00:21.353
A bond that should protect her.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.023
<i>But there are forces</i>
<i>that conspire,</i>

00:24.025 --> 00:27.693
<i>Forces of darkness,</i>
<i>forces of the heart.</i>

00:27.695 --> 00:30.162
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

00:31.364 --> 00:33.165
Mary:
<i>Previously on</i> reign:

00:33.167 --> 00:34.700
The news of a crisis
in scotland.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.668
The english.
They're massing
on the border.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.370
You are supposed
to be our ally.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.039
You only have to
worry about England.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.373
I have England, Spain,

00:41.375 --> 00:43.442
100 italian and
german principalities.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.178
Mary, I'm sorry.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.780
But I see your struggle
here in France.

00:47.782 --> 00:50.249
Say yes and you'll
have your man.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.117
He's willing to actually
get married, too, which is

00:52.119 --> 00:53.585
More than your family
is offering.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.454
It's bash.
Henry: <i>While bash was riding</i>

00:55.456 --> 00:57.122
<i>To six different companies,</i>
<i>it appears someone loyal</i>

00:57.124 --> 00:59.391
To the english rode straight
to calais and warned them.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.160
Francis:
<i>France can't help.</i>

01:01.162 --> 01:02.528
There are no more
troops to send.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.296
You should marry tomas.

01:15.542 --> 01:16.675
Who designed the target?

01:16.677 --> 01:18.277
Catherine:
Oh, who knows?

01:18.279 --> 01:20.379
Well, they say it looks
like the castle ghost.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.081
You know, the girl they
blame for every servant

01:22.083 --> 01:23.582
Who runs off or goes missing.

01:24.784 --> 01:26.185
Nice shot, tomas.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.853
But the object
is to hit the heart.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.388
Is it?

01:30.256 --> 01:32.224
(sighs)

01:32.226 --> 01:35.194
Aylee:
Is he allowed
to take another shot?

01:39.866 --> 01:42.434
(sighs, chuckles)

01:42.436 --> 01:44.837
(crowd murmuring)

01:44.839 --> 01:47.339
Did I take too many shots?

01:47.341 --> 01:48.540
Technically, yes.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.477
Shall I take another shot, too?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.547
Take as many shots
as you like.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.282
You'll still lose.

02:04.691 --> 02:05.891
(applause)

02:05.893 --> 02:07.593
Man:
Round goes to prince francis.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.495
Second round, new target.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.830
Does tomas seem different
the last few days?

02:11.832 --> 02:13.332
A little more bold?

02:13.334 --> 02:14.366
More intense?

02:14.368 --> 02:15.701
Greer:
More mercurial, anyway.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.836
More engaged
to mary, certainly.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.872
But not all the way
engaged... Not yet.

02:19.874 --> 02:22.307
Greer:
And how do you feel about that?

02:22.309 --> 02:23.442
I detect reservations.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.877
Doesn't matter how I feel.

02:24.879 --> 02:26.712
I have to marry who's
right for scotland.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.780
How do you feel
if tomas is that man?

02:28.782 --> 02:31.717
I feel that we should
remember it's still a secret.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.452
At least until
king henry releases me

02:33.454 --> 02:35.621
From my engagement
to francis.

02:35.623 --> 02:38.223
That's no answer.

02:38.225 --> 02:40.292
Walk with your uncle.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.497
Mary:
<i>Almost agreed?</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:47.366
You and king henry have
been talking for days.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.368
What have you been discussing?
The weather?

02:49.370 --> 02:51.236
These are tricky
matters of state.

02:51.238 --> 02:52.938
Your marriage treaty
with portugal doesn't end

02:52.940 --> 02:56.275
Our alliance with France
but changes it.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.211
Still, for henry's approval,
there will be conditions.

02:59.213 --> 03:01.480
I will not beg for an outcome
I'm not certain I want.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.514
You will beg.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.949
Because scotland
needs this.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.517
Portugal's ships are all
that keep the english

03:05.519 --> 03:06.852
From raiding our borderland.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.720
Now, henry won't offer
the same protection,

03:08.722 --> 03:09.788
But he's still a king.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.190
And kings can't be seen

03:11.192 --> 03:13.492
Letting allies walk freely
from treaties.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.561
But queens can be seen
begging release

03:15.563 --> 03:17.529
For treaties that go unenforced?

03:17.531 --> 03:18.830
You'll be queen of nothing
if you don't

03:18.832 --> 03:19.831
Make scotland safe
from England.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.266
And you can't do that

03:21.268 --> 03:22.334
Without portugal's
strength,

03:22.336 --> 03:23.602
Which you can't have

03:23.604 --> 03:25.370
Without henry's release
to marry tomas.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.740
(crowd gasping, applause)

03:34.347 --> 03:36.348
Queen mary's anxious
to know how bash is.

03:36.350 --> 03:39.384
The wound is closing.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.253
But the disease
in his blood is spreading.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.754
If the fever doesn't
break by tonight...

03:42.756 --> 03:44.923
He could die?
So soon?

03:44.925 --> 03:47.292
You're scaring the poor girl,
nostradamus.

03:47.294 --> 03:49.761
Where's your chivalry?
Oh, bash,

03:49.763 --> 03:50.862
How do you feel?

03:50.864 --> 03:52.731
Close to death, apparently.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.367
Which feels, more or less,
like it sounds.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.269
Nostradamus:
You need rest, sebastian.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.804
What I need is water.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.272
And perhaps...

04:00.274 --> 04:02.507
A little bit more
of that lovely...

04:02.509 --> 04:04.276
Worried frown.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.578
I think I can manage that.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.480
(bash chuckles)

04:09.449 --> 04:10.782
(bash coughs)

04:17.590 --> 04:19.458
So, will you run

04:19.460 --> 04:21.526
Back to mary
with the troubling news,

04:21.528 --> 04:23.996
Like her other ladies,
or will you stay

04:23.998 --> 04:26.665
And look death in the face?

04:26.667 --> 04:29.701
I nursed two of my brothers
into the grave.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.470
Scarlet fever.

04:31.472 --> 04:34.006
And I've known
other losses, too.

04:34.008 --> 04:36.708
I'm not scared of death anymore.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.710
I'm scared of being alone.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.946
There's a difference?

04:42.882 --> 04:44.850
Nostradamus:
I'm terribly sorry,

04:44.852 --> 04:46.318
But this isn't helping him rest.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.353
Every time I look at her,
I feel better.

04:48.355 --> 04:49.755
Every time
I look at you,

04:49.757 --> 04:51.290
I feel worse.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.557
The prescription
is clear,

04:52.559 --> 04:53.959
Don't you think?

04:59.832 --> 05:02.768
There's a book
of norse mythology

05:02.770 --> 05:04.703
Over there,

05:04.705 --> 05:07.372
If you wouldn't mind
reading it to me.

05:07.374 --> 05:09.941
Unless, of course, you wanted
to go back to the tournament.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.377
Not at all.

05:15.915 --> 05:16.982
(exhales)

05:21.087 --> 05:22.587
(crowd murmuring)

05:22.589 --> 05:25.324
Man:
Bull's-eye. Very good.

05:26.693 --> 05:30.329
So, is it done?
Are you marrying tomas?

05:30.331 --> 05:31.930
The agreement's
close, but it...

05:31.932 --> 05:33.965
It's complicated.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.335
Is anything uncomplicated
in France?

05:42.475 --> 05:45.477
Man:
Lord tomas is the winner.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.493
Will you accept my favor,
mary, queen of scots?

06:01.495 --> 06:03.462
(people murmuring)

06:06.733 --> 06:08.867
Have I offended?

06:08.869 --> 06:11.069
Not at all.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.438
Please.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.377
Thank you, tomas.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.578
I'm honored.

06:29.989 --> 06:32.924
I'm sorry.
That was thoughtless of him

06:32.926 --> 06:35.026
To publicly
offer his favor.
I don't know--

06:35.028 --> 06:37.162
I think it was
<i>very</i> well thought out.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.030
But I don't see
the point.

06:39.032 --> 06:42.100
He's already won your hand,
hasn't he?

06:42.102 --> 06:44.002
The treaty
is almost complete.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.737
So you're leaving.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.872
Francis, I wanted to tell you...

06:46.874 --> 06:48.607
If you mean to tell me
that you

06:48.609 --> 06:50.142
Don't want to go,
please don't.

06:50.144 --> 06:52.110
It won't help.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.112
I did everything
I could

06:54.114 --> 06:56.114
To help scotland
so that you could stay.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.582
It was almost enough,

06:57.584 --> 07:00.619
If not for a single spy.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.854
Someone who's probably here
with us right now.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.924
I'm so sorry.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.994
â™ª

07:12.031 --> 07:13.832
What are they
telling king henry?

07:16.169 --> 07:17.936
It's not good news.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.738
I hope it's not bash.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.677
What's this?
Take your hands off me.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.146
I'm lord simon westbrook.
I'm the envoy of England.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.214
You're a murderer
and a spy.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.149
You slipped word
to your countrymen

07:31.151 --> 07:32.184
That french troops were

07:32.186 --> 07:33.785
Headed to scotland.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.654
You caused a slaughter,
nearly killing my son!

07:35.656 --> 07:36.955
Oh, that's absurd.
I'm a diplomat.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.657
I'm here to help
keep the peace.

07:38.659 --> 07:39.925
Then you failed your mission.

07:39.927 --> 07:40.926
So your queen
won't mind

07:40.928 --> 07:42.894
When I send her your head.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.063
Take him away!
Majesty, you...
You're mistaken.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.165
Let go of me! I've
done no such thing.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.967
Why would I? You've
got the wrong man!

07:57.577 --> 07:59.678
Catherine:
Poor mary.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.948
You feel like the king
will never see you.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.249
And you a queen.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.951
I'm glad that my unhappiness

08:05.953 --> 08:07.686
Brings you such pleasure.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.588
Oh, your unhappiness
gives me no pleasure.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.056
Your absence, however...

08:11.058 --> 08:13.124
Why do you hate me so?

08:13.126 --> 08:16.261
If I'm going to portugal,
why not just say it?

08:16.263 --> 08:19.030
You were kind to me
when I was young.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.601
When I look at you,
I see death.

08:25.204 --> 08:27.973
I see your country
hanging around my son's neck.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.808
I see <i>his</i> men

08:29.810 --> 08:33.078
Off defending <i>your</i>
<i>country, dying.</i>

08:33.080 --> 08:35.714
Well, if I am
such a burden,

08:35.716 --> 08:37.716
Make the king release me

08:37.718 --> 08:39.684
So I may be
portugal's burden instead.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.520
I wish I could,

08:41.522 --> 08:43.889
But henry feels that scotland's
been poached from him.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.624
How can I make the king

08:45.626 --> 08:47.125
Change his mind?

08:47.127 --> 08:50.762
Well... There is
one small thing.

08:55.268 --> 08:58.270
And how may I help France,
your majesty?

08:58.272 --> 08:59.905
These english,

08:59.907 --> 09:02.140
We keep them at court
to help keep peace,

09:02.142 --> 09:04.009
But it appears
they don't want peace.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.877
Their envoy, simon,

09:05.879 --> 09:07.612
Was overheard boasting
in a local tavern

09:07.614 --> 09:08.947
About his role in the ambush.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.282
How he warned

09:10.284 --> 09:12.684
His countrymen
of our soldiers' movements.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.553
The trouble is,
to condemn a diplomat

09:14.555 --> 09:17.622
We need testimony
no nation can question.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.157
A witness whose word
is unassailable.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.326
Instead, we have her.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.063
(people whispering)

09:29.035 --> 09:30.835
(whispers):
She's a prostitute, mary.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.637
But a very brave woman.

09:32.639 --> 09:35.307
She came here at great risk
to aid the king's justice.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.177
You want me to put
my name to her words?

09:40.780 --> 09:43.048
If you don't,
a murderer goes free--

09:43.050 --> 09:45.050
A man who put my brother
at death's door.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.659
What is your name?

09:54.661 --> 09:56.795
Judith. Uh, milady.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.798
And you saw simon
with your own eyes, judith?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.166
Yeah.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.335
And I heard them
call him by name, too.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.203
He had a f...
A fine face,

10:05.205 --> 10:09.007
And posh clothes, and that
medallion around his neck,

10:09.009 --> 10:10.909
The one with the sun's rays.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.777
The royal english seal.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.279
Now, you know
that this seal

10:14.281 --> 10:16.348
Means he is
a very powerful man,

10:16.350 --> 10:17.682
And that he can hurt you,

10:17.684 --> 10:19.684
But you came
forward anyway.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.353
Why?

10:22.955 --> 10:24.823
(quietly):
I heard how that
englishman talked.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.091
He's a heartless man,

10:26.093 --> 10:27.993
Playing games
with other men's lives.

10:30.229 --> 10:32.297
If I sign my name

10:32.299 --> 10:34.766
To her statement,
will you release me

10:34.768 --> 10:36.901
From my engagement
to francis?

10:42.975 --> 10:45.977
Very well, then.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.178
Henry:
Notify the executioner.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.214
The english spy
will lose his head

10:49.216 --> 10:50.782
At the michaelmas banquet.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.253
Well, it's done.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.656
Mary's engaged to tomas,
and she's leaving.

10:57.658 --> 10:58.823
Your majesty.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.325
You've gotten
your wish.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.862
I never wished for a spy
to cause french blood to spill.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.731
And it's unfortunate for you
that spy happened to be simon.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.066
(sighs)

11:08.068 --> 11:09.801
Perhaps he made himself useful

11:09.803 --> 11:12.303
So that I would overlook
his larger crime.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.739
I will not.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.174
So the end justifies any means.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.776
This will save
my son's life.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.345
Unless you tell me
your visions have changed.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.414
Mmm, if anything,
it's the opposite.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.683
My dreams are more
vivid, more ominous.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.986
Mary's presence here
will cost you your firstborn.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.322
The engagement's been official

11:31.324 --> 11:32.323
Less than an hour,

11:32.325 --> 11:34.059
And you're already packing?

11:34.061 --> 11:36.061
I have no choice. I'm going
to portugal in two days,

11:36.063 --> 11:38.029
Right after
the michaelmas banquet.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.764
You're leaving?

11:39.766 --> 11:41.966
What about us?
You don't want us

11:41.968 --> 11:43.802
To come with you?
Of course I do,

11:43.804 --> 11:45.103
More than anything.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.171
But you do have a choice.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.205
I can't ask you

11:47.207 --> 11:48.807
To come with me
when none of you

11:48.809 --> 11:49.941
Expected to live
in portugal.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.309
You all moved
from scotland

11:51.311 --> 11:52.844
To be here in France.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.447
No, mary. We left
to be with you.

11:55.449 --> 11:57.382
So you'll come with me?

11:57.384 --> 12:00.085
Aylee, lola and greer:
Of course we will.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.353
I don't deserve any of you.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.090
You deserve to marry
someone you love.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.491
Or at least like.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.327
Kings and queens
don't have that luxury.

12:23.275 --> 12:28.279
I wonder whose face you're
imagining on that target.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.914
A portuguese prince, perhaps?

12:29.916 --> 12:31.916
(chuckles)
maybe next time.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.452
This time,
it's that english envoy.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.858
Simon is lucky you're
not the headsman.

12:39.860 --> 12:43.128
Or he'd be
dead already.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.998
I don't know
who's lucky anymore.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.901
I used to think that we were,

12:49.903 --> 12:52.237
The years that we had
as children,

12:52.239 --> 12:55.073
The time we've had
since you've been back at court.

12:56.809 --> 12:59.077
Now I feel those days like
something sharp in my heart.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.980
Let's not speak of this.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.515
I want...

13:03.517 --> 13:04.883
I just wish...

13:04.885 --> 13:06.284
Mary, we can't.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.920
We can't.
The castle.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.525
Maybe we could find
some other place.

13:13.527 --> 13:15.527
The lakeside.

13:15.529 --> 13:19.063
At sunset.

13:32.044 --> 13:34.245
â™ª

13:40.452 --> 13:43.354
(knocking)

13:44.957 --> 13:46.357
Kenna.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.059
Your grace.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.266
I was surprised when
you were announced.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.869
I didn't think...

14:03.509 --> 14:05.844
You seem
different now.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.346
More... Willing.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.181
I am.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.382
I wonder why.
(chuckles)

14:11.384 --> 14:13.484
I'm leaving in two days.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.553
I want this.

14:17.389 --> 14:19.123
Is that meant to...

14:19.125 --> 14:21.125
Convince you or me?

14:21.127 --> 14:22.493
Kenna, are you
sure of this?

14:22.495 --> 14:23.561
Yes.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.098
But it's not all I want.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.969
I want to stay.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.237
Stay?

14:32.239 --> 14:34.072
Stay as what?

14:34.074 --> 14:36.574
You're mary's lady.
If she's gone, what...

14:36.576 --> 14:38.076
Position would you
hold at court?

14:38.078 --> 14:39.510
Well, the position
you would give me.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.481
As your mistress.
(sighs)

14:43.483 --> 14:46.184
And perhaps in time,
I could have more.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.185
Kenna.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.988
I have a mistress.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.991
Diane has been with me
for half my life.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.492
We've had decades together.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.264
The heart needs time.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.132
Mine doesn't.

15:01.134 --> 15:04.202
And even if it does,
I have no time.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.441
(door opens)

15:16.382 --> 15:18.650
I'm trying to understand how
this could happen, but I can't.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.318
We're not at war
with the english.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.186
We were careful
to send enough men

15:22.188 --> 15:25.123
To discourage their aggression
but not... Not to threaten them.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.659
Which is why you should
stop blaming yourself.

15:27.661 --> 15:30.328
I don't blame myself.
I blame simon.

15:30.330 --> 15:34.599
My instincts were right,
and the portuguese proved it.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.035
As soon as the english saw
that scotland had a friend

15:37.037 --> 15:39.337
That would defend them,
they stopped their attacks.

15:39.339 --> 15:42.674
If it weren't
for that ambush...

15:42.676 --> 15:44.943
Mary would still be yours.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.211
This is not
about my broken heart, mother.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.447
No, it's about
your good heart.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.049
I'm not mocking
you, francis.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.351
Your heart is good.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.353
It's good enough to love
your bastard brother

15:55.355 --> 15:57.956
And to try to love
your future wife.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.292
If only your father's heart
could do that.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.365
(sighs)
if only mine could stop.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.034
What if mary's just moving

16:10.036 --> 16:11.703
From one waiting game
to another?

16:11.705 --> 16:13.638
Let her go, francis.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.007
You're worrying over nothing.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.408
You would say that.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.210
You can't stand her.

16:20.512 --> 16:22.580
My instincts say not
to trust tomas.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.249
They were right before.

16:25.251 --> 16:28.586
Maybe it's time
I stopped doubting them.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.429
I almost thought
you weren't coming.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.698
I've been busy.
I know.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.700
You've been asking questions
about tomas.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.169
It's all over the castle,
and if <i>I've</i> heard...

16:45.171 --> 16:46.671
Tomas will hear, too.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.139
I don't care.
Let him think

16:48.141 --> 16:49.574
That I'm jealous
if he wants to,

16:49.576 --> 16:51.009
As long as he knows
that he's accountable

16:51.011 --> 16:52.043
For how he treats you.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.078
I hear he's cruel

16:54.080 --> 16:55.613
To his servants.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.215
Francis,

16:57.217 --> 17:00.351
Thank you, but you
don't need to worry.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.353
Now, come. Sit with me.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.694
I've asked my
uncle to be sure

17:09.696 --> 17:11.396
Of my safety in portugal.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.231
He assures me it will be fine.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.299
You need more
than your uncle's word.

17:15.301 --> 17:18.669
Mary, if anything happens
to you, I feel responsible.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.139
When I couldn't make
scotland safe, I told you

17:21.141 --> 17:22.407
To marry this man.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.308
I'm not going
into this blindly,

17:24.310 --> 17:26.310
And I won't let him hurt me.

17:26.312 --> 17:29.380
There are rumors about
his scheming, his cruelty...

17:29.382 --> 17:31.649
There are rumors
about all royals.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.651
You know what
they say about you?

17:33.653 --> 17:36.254
Half of europe thinks
that you're sickly

17:36.256 --> 17:37.722
And weak and stunted.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.258
That half-blind portrait artist
didn't realize

17:40.260 --> 17:42.593
I was sitting in a chair
while my sister was standing,

17:42.595 --> 17:44.562
And now half of europe
thinks I'm a dwarf.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.730
(laughs)

17:45.732 --> 17:47.098
And they say that bash

17:47.100 --> 17:48.499
Got all the good
looks and passion,

17:48.501 --> 17:50.501
And all you have
is tedious...

18:16.361 --> 18:18.463
(chuckles)

18:18.465 --> 18:19.730
Mary:
Tomas.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.768
Forgive me, mary.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.637
I needed to see you, and I
couldn't wait for formalities.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.673
I would like
to discuss some...

18:28.675 --> 18:30.675
Rules, and your lady

18:30.677 --> 18:32.110
Should hear them, too.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.377
Rules?

18:33.379 --> 18:35.480
Rules you will live
by in portugal.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.149
You seem to believe that
until you're married to me

18:38.151 --> 18:40.118
You're somehow free.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.354
If so, you're mistaken.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.690
My lord, I don't know
if I like your tone.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.658
Do you have whipping
boys in scotland?

18:47.660 --> 18:48.759
Whipping boys?

18:48.761 --> 18:50.661
Well, s-some
use them, but...

18:50.663 --> 18:53.297
Good. Miguel is now
your whipping boy.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.235
That is for the offense
of questioning me.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.436
Tomas, please...

19:00.572 --> 19:02.206
That is for interrupting me.

19:03.709 --> 19:04.842
Much better.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.477
You're bound

19:06.479 --> 19:08.746
By a treaty agreed
by your betters:

19:08.748 --> 19:11.382
Your uncle, myself
and king henry.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.551
And if you're not
impressed by the treaty,

19:13.553 --> 19:15.153
Maybe you will be
by this:

19:15.155 --> 19:18.656
My ships made your
country safe, but...

19:19.892 --> 19:21.859
...I can remove them

19:21.861 --> 19:24.529
As easily as this.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.865
Whatever freedoms of actions

19:27.867 --> 19:30.935
Or thought you were given
by francis, forget them.

19:30.937 --> 19:34.472
When I am king, I will rule
like most kings:

19:34.474 --> 19:36.607
What belongs to my queen
belongs to me.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.577
For miguel's sake...

19:40.779 --> 19:41.946
...I hope we
are clear.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.682
Are we?

19:44.684 --> 19:47.218
Yes, my lord.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.320
Quite clear.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.664
You can't marry him,

19:59.666 --> 20:00.798
I beg of you.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.966
Aylee, you heard him.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.467
But you're a queen.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.903
There must be some other way.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.906
If there was any other option,
don't you think I would take it?

20:08.908 --> 20:10.808
I have to marry tomas,

20:10.810 --> 20:12.877
No matter who he is,

20:12.879 --> 20:14.478
No matter my feelings...

20:15.347 --> 20:16.647
...Because I am a queen.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.483
I have no other option.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.827
Good news. The fever is broken.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.929
(sighs)
thank god.
Bash: So I can get out...

20:31.931 --> 20:33.431
I wouldn't recommend it.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.732
You're going to live

20:34.734 --> 20:36.667
If you don't tear
your wound open,

20:36.669 --> 20:39.537
If you keep resting,
if you take proper care.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.639
If I have to spend
one more minute in this bed...

20:41.641 --> 20:44.742
I'm going to make us both
feel better... And leave.

20:54.553 --> 20:57.688
You promised you'd sneak me
some wine, you liar.

21:00.959 --> 21:03.494
You look worse than I do.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.630
It's tomas, isn't it?

21:05.632 --> 21:08.432
Lola told me
about your... Inquiries.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.900
I don't have any proof yet,

21:09.902 --> 21:11.969
But everything in me
says that he's a monster.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.971
There are
whispers in court

21:13.973 --> 21:15.640
That he murdered his first wife.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.275
If they couldn't find proof
in portugal,

21:17.277 --> 21:18.643
How will you find it here?

21:18.645 --> 21:21.579
I don't know yet...
But I have to try.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.414
I can't let mary...

21:23.416 --> 21:25.850
Tomas:
Oh, but you can,

21:25.852 --> 21:27.385
And you must.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.422
You've been asking
questions about me.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.657
Did you think
I wouldn't know?

21:32.659 --> 21:34.392
No. No, I hoped you would.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.793
Why?

21:35.795 --> 21:38.596
Because your future wife
is a friend of France.

21:38.598 --> 21:41.065
Her well-being concerns
this country, and always will.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.933
Is that a threat?

21:42.935 --> 21:45.603
If anything
happens to mary,

21:45.605 --> 21:47.738
You'll... What?

21:47.740 --> 21:50.341
I would hope
we won't need to find out.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.876
Wouldn't you, as her fiancÃ©?

21:51.878 --> 21:54.679
If anything happens to her,
it will be up to me.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.747
She's my property
now, not yours.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.449
No matter how many touches
you steal.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.751
You'll never be more than
the powerless princeling

22:00.753 --> 22:02.887
Who couldn't even send a few men
to defend her country.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.022
Francis, no!
(groans)

22:05.024 --> 22:06.957
Sit. Don't.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.926
(panting loudly)

22:08.928 --> 22:10.728
(scoffs)
(groans softly)

22:13.665 --> 22:15.666
(panting)

22:15.668 --> 22:18.102
Go ahead, say it.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.104
I'm not thinking
with my head.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.373
Head, heart, who cares?

22:22.375 --> 22:26.043
He is a monster, no matter what
the pope chooses to call him,

22:26.045 --> 22:28.846
And if you won't
kill him, I will.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.059
Well, I would never know
there was a costume banquet

22:42.061 --> 22:44.929
In an hour
from the faces I see.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.063
Lola:
How can you be
so cheerful,

22:46.065 --> 22:47.832
Knowing how soon
we're leaving?

22:47.834 --> 22:51.602
Should I spend my last hours
in France with moping and tears?

22:53.071 --> 22:54.939
Don't forget pining and regret.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.607
â™ª my world turns to gray

22:56.609 --> 23:01.445
â™ª the pain is hard to take

23:01.447 --> 23:04.815
â™ª but it won't fade away

23:04.817 --> 23:06.417
â™ª 'cause I know...

23:06.419 --> 23:07.985
Mary's right.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.920
What's the matter
with us?

23:09.922 --> 23:12.656
Why wallow in misery
if we have a choice?

23:12.658 --> 23:14.091
Why not use
the hours we have left

23:14.093 --> 23:16.894
To seize some pleasure
while we still can?

23:16.896 --> 23:17.962
Kenna:
Yes.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.697
Some pleasure.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.031
Or perhaps some spite.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.466
Greer:
A lovely wood sprite!

23:22.468 --> 23:24.068
France will
never forget you.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.437
I hope that
they won't. (hums)

23:26.439 --> 23:27.638
Aylee:
You want to dress up

23:27.640 --> 23:28.973
In a footman's livery?

23:28.975 --> 23:30.141
Greer:
Yes. Why not?

23:30.143 --> 23:31.809
But in case I change my mind,

23:31.811 --> 23:33.177
I'll take both.

23:38.450 --> 23:40.985
(clattering, rapid footsteps)

23:47.492 --> 23:49.527
What's this?

23:56.134 --> 23:58.702
The royal english seal.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.206
This is simon's, isn't it?

24:03.608 --> 24:05.810
Why would you want me
to have this?

24:07.879 --> 24:10.481
(groans)

24:10.483 --> 24:12.917
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.452
(laughs)

24:14.454 --> 24:16.487
I know you.

24:16.489 --> 24:18.622
I met you in a dream I had

24:18.624 --> 24:20.791
About norse gods and goddesses
from that book we read.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.494
(laughs)

24:23.496 --> 24:25.162
The reality's better.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.498
Are you sure you should
be swinging that sword?

24:27.500 --> 24:29.200
You might reopen
your wound.

24:29.202 --> 24:32.169
Well, better my sword reopens it
than someone else's.

24:32.171 --> 24:35.606
Aha! St. Michael,
aren't you?

24:35.608 --> 24:37.808
Better be a real sword
if you plan to slay lucifer.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.777
You had to
bring up tomas?

24:39.779 --> 24:42.913
Lola:
I don't understand why
he changed so quickly.

24:42.915 --> 24:46.150
Before mary said yes, tomas
seemed a whole other person.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.952
He was desperate.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.920
He'd been looking for a
queen all over the continent.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.756
No doubt to make sure the
pope declared him legitimate.

24:52.758 --> 24:55.192
Of course he'd put on an act
if it got what him he wanted.

24:55.194 --> 24:56.961
Well, he got bloody lucky,
didn't he?

24:56.963 --> 24:58.496
If I hadn't been ambushed

24:58.498 --> 24:59.964
Getting those men off
to scotland,

24:59.966 --> 25:01.565
Mary wouldn't be marrying him.

25:01.567 --> 25:03.834
Say that again.

25:05.270 --> 25:06.737
If our men hadn't been ambushed,

25:06.739 --> 25:09.139
Then mary wouldn't need his men,

25:09.141 --> 25:10.808
Or his marriage proposal.

25:13.111 --> 25:15.679
â™ª get me to the road

25:15.681 --> 25:19.783
â™ª upon the heart
that I had stole â™ª

25:19.785 --> 25:23.220
â™ª worn my heavy hands

25:23.222 --> 25:25.055
â™ª my heavy hands

25:25.057 --> 25:26.657
â™ª the yellow hole...

25:28.860 --> 25:31.862
Simon, I was told
I could find you here.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.598
So you've heard.
I'm the entertainment.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.867
Or my head is
when it comes off at midnight.

25:38.103 --> 25:39.904
Try not to look so upset.

25:39.906 --> 25:42.273
Why would I be upset?
I understand you signed

25:42.275 --> 25:44.708
The statement naming me
as the spy behind that ambush.

25:46.111 --> 25:48.178
I don't suppose you care
that I'm innocent.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.948
I might... If I believed it.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.050
(sighs)

25:53.052 --> 25:54.785
Is that my seal stamp?

25:54.787 --> 25:56.954
Wondered where that thing went.
Tell me,

25:56.956 --> 26:00.658
Why is your seal so similar
to the royal english seal?

26:00.660 --> 26:03.060
The queen is a cousin
by marriage.

26:03.062 --> 26:06.931
She styles the rose white,
we style it red.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.099
Why do you ask?

26:09.101 --> 26:10.868
A friend of mine was interested.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.803
Thought I might be
interested, too.

26:14.706 --> 26:15.873
Tomas:
Mary?

26:15.875 --> 26:17.207
Come here, please.

26:22.213 --> 26:24.348
Good evening, my lord.

26:25.684 --> 26:28.085
Hmm. You look
like a huntress.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.620
I chose my costume for you.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.622
I know that the bow
is your favorite weapon.

26:31.624 --> 26:34.592
My second favorite,
but thank you.

26:34.594 --> 26:35.960
(gasps)

26:35.962 --> 26:37.895
Your grip is
a little tight, my lord.

26:37.897 --> 26:41.632
No tighter than your
former fiancÃ©'s, I'm sure.

26:41.634 --> 26:44.768
I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.104
Huh? Must I send

26:47.106 --> 26:49.306
For your whipping boy?
Let go of her.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.709
(grunts)

26:51.711 --> 26:54.645
You've forgotten
our talk. Mary is

26:54.647 --> 26:56.780
My fiancÃ©e now.
You came here

26:56.782 --> 26:59.717
Almost a crown prince,
but not quite.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.785
You needed a queen
to seal your deal with the pope.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.053
And when mary

27:03.055 --> 27:04.922
Needed troops sent
to her country,

27:04.924 --> 27:08.359
You were suddenly there to help,
because my men were ambushed.

27:08.361 --> 27:10.995
On a tip from a spy in court.

27:11.963 --> 27:14.064
A spy we assumed
was simon.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.799
When tomas had
a far better motive.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.868
If you're accusing
the next king of portugal,

27:17.870 --> 27:19.670
I hope you have proof.

27:19.672 --> 27:21.338
We'll have proof
soon enough.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.807
In the meantime,
let go of mary.

27:25.844 --> 27:27.177
(gasps)

27:29.681 --> 27:31.682
Are you all right?

27:31.684 --> 27:33.417
Yes. You said
you'd have proof?

27:33.419 --> 27:35.085
Did you mean his valet miguel?

27:35.087 --> 27:36.687
Tomas could not
have acted alone.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.022
He hates his master.

27:38.024 --> 27:40.257
I think he'll help us
if we can protect him.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.992
We will.
I've sent guards to find him.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.727
If simon is innocent,

27:43.729 --> 27:46.130
And the woman whose words
I signed my name to lied,

27:46.132 --> 27:48.966
She's a pawn in this king's game
as much as I am.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.234
She might help us, too.

27:50.236 --> 27:52.436
Otherwise,
if simon dies wrongly,

27:52.438 --> 27:55.105
We will both have war
with England.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.708
And we can't let that happen.

28:00.111 --> 28:02.413
(panting)

28:02.415 --> 28:04.381
Miguel wasn't in his
chambers, but a footman said

28:04.383 --> 28:06.817
He saw him leaving with tomas,
headed for the game trails.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.686
Hunting-- now?

28:08.688 --> 28:10.921
Tomas must want to kill miguel
before anyone talks to him.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.367
â™ª take, take me

28:23.369 --> 28:25.269
â™ª you need me

28:25.271 --> 28:28.739
â™ª don't leave me now...

28:28.741 --> 28:30.407
Is there anything
my lady wants?

28:30.409 --> 28:33.043
Keep your voice down!
You're a kitchen boy.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.446
If anyone catches you here,
you'll be flogged.

28:35.448 --> 28:38.282
Did you leave this costume
in my room, or didn't you?

28:38.284 --> 28:39.817
Yes, but we have

28:39.819 --> 28:41.785
To be discreet.

28:41.787 --> 28:44.388
My family is depending on me to
bring home a title and lands,

28:44.390 --> 28:46.023
To marry someone
who's better than me.

28:46.025 --> 28:49.093
Why not just celebrate
michaelmas?

28:49.095 --> 28:50.928
What does that even mean?

28:50.930 --> 28:52.096
Saint michael.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.464
He slew lucifer

28:53.466 --> 28:56.467
Who sewed vanity,
pride and shame,

28:56.469 --> 28:59.870
Which is why
we wear these masks.

28:59.872 --> 29:03.507
So on this one day, no one's
better than anyone else.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.509
We're all the same.

29:05.511 --> 29:10.981
â™ª 'cause you're my girl
now, now. â™ª

29:10.983 --> 29:13.183
What lies! Why would I?
I'd say for
the money

29:13.185 --> 29:15.052
To buy that new cloak
and those boots,

29:15.054 --> 29:17.855
And to get a ride out of
town on that vegetable cart.

29:20.859 --> 29:22.392
And for this.

29:22.394 --> 29:25.129
To make him stop
hitting you.

29:25.131 --> 29:27.097
I got that from a patron.

29:28.466 --> 29:31.034
When I signed your statement,

29:31.036 --> 29:34.004
You told me that you
saw simon clearly.

29:34.006 --> 29:37.274
His face, his clothes,
his medallion.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.343
What was the color of the rose
on his medallion?

29:39.345 --> 29:42.045
I'll make it easy for you.
Was it red or white?

29:42.047 --> 29:45.048
It was white,
the seal of the english crown.

29:45.050 --> 29:48.085
Simon's seal is different
from England's.

29:48.087 --> 29:50.821
His rose is red.
Please leave me be.
I'm so scared.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.923
The king will have
your head for your lies.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.224
But he may
show you mercy

29:54.226 --> 29:57.461
If you tell me who made you lie,
and tell me now.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.797
Oh.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.298
He swore he would kill me.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.500
He wasn't lying if
he's who I think he is.

30:03.502 --> 30:06.103
Just tell me this.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.872
Would you know this man
if you saw him again?

30:11.476 --> 30:14.444
Get her on a horse.
We don't have much time.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.947
And you made sure the prostitute
left the village?

30:16.949 --> 30:19.082
I gave her the extra
gold, like you said.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.819
I told her to leave today,
or you would visit her again.

30:21.821 --> 30:23.987
Good. You've served me well,
miguel.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.223
I'll always remember.

30:26.225 --> 30:29.193
I'll make sure
your family remembers, too.

30:29.195 --> 30:31.094
My family?

30:31.096 --> 30:34.097
Well, you understand you can't
serve me while you still live.

30:34.099 --> 30:35.365
My lord, please!

30:35.367 --> 30:37.267
It's not "my lord"
anymore.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.403
It's "your majesty,"

30:39.405 --> 30:42.206
Because, thanks to you,
I'm going to be a king.

30:43.208 --> 30:45.609
Francis:
No!

30:45.611 --> 30:47.044
Run, miguel!

30:48.980 --> 30:50.314
(miguel yells)

30:55.420 --> 30:56.854
Don't kill him.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.255
We need his confession.

30:58.257 --> 31:01.158
I'm trying
very hard not to.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.894
Miguel! You're alive.
(gasping breaths)

31:03.896 --> 31:06.196
Don't worry, we can
get this arrow out.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.432
I'm afraid of him.

31:11.202 --> 31:14.304
(grunting, swords clashing)

31:19.210 --> 31:21.278
(grunting)

31:21.280 --> 31:22.346
(grunts in pain)

31:22.348 --> 31:24.248
(bash groans)

31:24.616 --> 31:27.885
(grunting)

31:27.887 --> 31:29.586
(bash panting)

31:34.626 --> 31:36.360
You're going to lose.

31:36.362 --> 31:39.263
You never learned how to take,
like a bastard learns.

31:40.265 --> 31:42.199
Take a crown, take a woman,

31:42.201 --> 31:43.600
Take a life!

31:43.602 --> 31:45.035
You can't do it!

31:45.037 --> 31:47.137
(grunting)

31:54.312 --> 31:55.379
(panting)

31:58.650 --> 32:00.183
(tomas grunts)

32:06.658 --> 32:09.126
(panting):
If you kill me,

32:09.128 --> 32:11.094
You'll have war.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.397
But if you let me go with mary,

32:13.399 --> 32:15.098
You'll have peace.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.367
When they take off your head,

32:17.369 --> 32:19.469
I'll remember
the men you killed.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.338
And mary.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.283
Can you ride?

32:33.285 --> 32:36.153
We need to get back
before they execute simon.

32:41.359 --> 32:43.694
Killing isn't
supposed to be easy.

32:43.696 --> 32:47.064
If your hands weren't
shaking, you'd be him.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.166
â™ª

33:01.980 --> 33:04.648
What's going on?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.316
Lola:
It's time for simon's head
to come off.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.517
Where's mary?

33:07.519 --> 33:08.986
Where's francis and bash?

33:08.988 --> 33:10.153
They're going to be too late.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.155
â™ª run, boy, run

33:12.157 --> 33:14.391
â™ª they're trying to catch you

33:14.393 --> 33:15.659
â™ª run, boy, run

33:15.661 --> 33:18.195
â™ª running is a victory

33:18.197 --> 33:21.398
â™ª run, boy, run, beauty lies
behind the hills... â™ª

33:21.400 --> 33:22.666
Your grace.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.668
I'm begging you,
please wait for your sons

33:24.670 --> 33:26.670
To return-- they think they
can prove simon innocent.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.338
So I've been told.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.474
But if I let justice wait
for every last effort

33:30.476 --> 33:32.476
To prove a man innocent,
there'd be no justice.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.678
Is that what the queen says?

33:34.680 --> 33:37.080
No. The queen says waiting
makes me look weak,

33:37.082 --> 33:38.548
Like less of a king.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.183
And she says it to everyone.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.619
If anything, I think it makes
you look more like a king.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.688
Wise and fair and strong.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.624
A king we can believe in.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.693
â™ª

33:51.329 --> 33:53.563
You finally covered
yourself up.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.735
I couldn't think straight,
seeing you before.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.571
I hope that thinking straight
helps you make the right choice,

34:01.573 --> 34:03.106
And wait.

34:03.108 --> 34:05.575
Before...

34:05.577 --> 34:08.578
When you said your heart
didn't have to wait...

34:08.580 --> 34:10.647
That was brave.

34:12.116 --> 34:14.317
Most people,
especially here...

34:14.319 --> 34:16.620
Would keep their
hearts hidden.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.622
Foolish is more like it.
(laughs softly)

34:18.624 --> 34:19.756
But thank you.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.726
If we do leave
tomorrow,

34:22.728 --> 34:25.429
I don't mind you knowing
that I'll think of you.

34:26.564 --> 34:27.764
Maybe...

34:27.766 --> 34:29.800
Maybe foolish is
something else.

34:29.802 --> 34:31.635
Maybe foolish is diane

34:31.637 --> 34:34.504
Endlessly shopping in paris,
leaving your king with...

34:34.506 --> 34:36.740
No one to share his burdens.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.809
Maybe foolish
is the queen

34:38.811 --> 34:41.578
Endlessly undermining
your king's authority.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.180
Maybe foolish is

34:43.182 --> 34:45.282
Not baring one's heart.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.750
What are you saying?

34:49.520 --> 34:52.756
I want you to stay.

34:52.758 --> 34:55.325
Whatever that means
for diane or catherine.

34:55.327 --> 34:58.695
I want you, kenna.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.363
(soft gasps)

35:00.365 --> 35:01.531
Francis:
Make way!

35:02.633 --> 35:04.534
This is your spy.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.670
(excited chatter, gasps)

35:06.672 --> 35:08.672
Francis:
We have witnesses.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.340
Two of them.

35:17.548 --> 35:18.815
Lord westbrook,

35:18.817 --> 35:20.750
Are you pleased that
England has made you

35:20.752 --> 35:22.219
Their new envoy to portugal?

35:22.221 --> 35:23.520
(quietly):
He's pleased portugal

35:23.522 --> 35:25.255
Paid him a king's ransom
to stay quiet

35:25.257 --> 35:26.523
About what tomas did to him.

35:26.525 --> 35:27.791
Well, with respect,
I'm pleased

35:27.793 --> 35:30.360
To be leaving here alive,
majesty.

35:30.362 --> 35:31.561
Catherine: Please
thank portugal's king

35:31.563 --> 35:34.764
For the sacrifice
of his son tomas,

35:34.766 --> 35:36.166
Who gave his life
to protect

35:36.168 --> 35:37.667
Our son from a stag's horns

35:37.669 --> 35:39.236
While hunting.

35:39.238 --> 35:40.670
Henry: As to
the vile rumors

35:40.672 --> 35:42.272
Tomas plotted
against France,

35:42.274 --> 35:43.540
Tell the king
we will ignore them

35:43.542 --> 35:44.908
If he will accept
our sentiments.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.576
Simon: Since portugal's king
had no knowledge

35:46.578 --> 35:49.713
Of any plot,
I'm confident he will accept.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.548
The matter will be
forgotten by all of us.

35:51.550 --> 35:54.718
And history, too, no doubt.

35:58.689 --> 36:00.557
You surprised me, majesty.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.292
Most royals won't
admit a mistake,

36:02.294 --> 36:04.261
Let alone save a
man's life to fix it.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.929
Well, I hope
that saving your life

36:05.931 --> 36:08.398
Wasn't my second mistake.

36:15.373 --> 36:17.240
Henry:
Mary, queen of scots,

36:17.242 --> 36:19.176
France is pleased
to reinstate

36:19.178 --> 36:20.544
Our marriage treaty
with your country.

36:20.546 --> 36:21.711
As soon as
negotiations...

36:21.713 --> 36:23.280
Thank you, your grace.

36:23.282 --> 36:24.681
Scotland is pleased as well.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.483
Especially since,
this time,

36:26.485 --> 36:28.385
You and my uncle
will be allowing <i>me</i>

36:28.387 --> 36:29.653
To guide negotiations.

36:29.655 --> 36:32.389
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

36:32.391 --> 36:34.491
Catherine:
Oh, for god's sake.
Henry: Mary, I don't think...

36:34.493 --> 36:36.593
Mary: In the view of
the role scotland played

36:36.595 --> 36:38.828
In resolving your troubles
with portugal,

36:38.830 --> 36:41.298
And in preventing
the wrongful execution

36:41.300 --> 36:42.632
Of a diplomat,

36:42.634 --> 36:43.700
We not only

36:43.702 --> 36:45.502
Staved off war with England,

36:45.504 --> 36:46.836
But also spared

36:46.838 --> 36:49.706
Our ally France
considerable embarrassment.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.975
Which is why
I am sure

36:51.977 --> 36:54.244
You will want
to <i>improve</i> the terms,

36:54.246 --> 36:55.512
Committing
enough strength

36:55.514 --> 36:58.848
To keep your ally safe
against England.

37:00.518 --> 37:01.985
Yes.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.553
Of course.

37:05.856 --> 37:07.724
Henry:
Let's continue.
As to the matter

37:07.726 --> 37:09.593
Of lands for your
dowry, there is

37:09.595 --> 37:11.428
Scottish crown
property which

37:11.430 --> 37:13.496
France finds of interest.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.899
Lola:
<i>Well done, mary.</i>

37:15.901 --> 37:18.368
You got practically
everything scotland wanted.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.570
Soldiers and ships
and armaments.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.706
Well, they got
a few things, too.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.574
Our best timber,
some farmland.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.643
But give it a few days,
and we will have

37:26.645 --> 37:28.345
A far better treaty than before.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.846
(knocking)

37:31.916 --> 37:33.917
Am I interrupting?

37:33.919 --> 37:37.354
â™ª

37:37.356 --> 37:38.421
(knocking)

37:42.593 --> 37:44.394
(laughs)
you.

37:44.396 --> 37:46.730
You have tormented me
long enough

37:46.732 --> 37:49.366
With waiting.
I completely agree.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.400
Mmm...

37:50.402 --> 37:51.668
(gasps, laughs)

37:51.670 --> 37:53.536
That's the kind
of talk I like to hear

37:53.538 --> 37:54.804
From my mistress.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.673
â™ª close your eyes

37:56.675 --> 37:58.942
â™ª and I will hide

37:58.944 --> 38:00.543
â™ª run

38:00.545 --> 38:03.013
â™ª run away...

38:03.015 --> 38:05.015
I like it here.

38:05.017 --> 38:07.951
It's very nice.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.553
Well, I like it here.

38:10.555 --> 38:11.888
(gasps softly)

38:11.890 --> 38:13.690
Be gentle.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.025
I will.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.993
The first time.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.429
(soft gasping)

38:20.765 --> 38:24.367
â™ª

38:24.369 --> 38:25.769
(moans softly)

38:29.840 --> 38:33.376
You killed a man
to protect me.

38:33.378 --> 38:35.912
I'm not really sure
what to say to that.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.714
"thank you"?

38:37.716 --> 38:40.450
"thank you"
doesn't cover it.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.452
You were right.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.354
Your heart was right.

38:44.356 --> 38:46.323
I suppose you
always were.

38:46.325 --> 38:48.725
How so?
I told you to
take your time,

38:48.727 --> 38:49.893
Be careful,

38:49.895 --> 38:52.595
Make the right
choice for France.

38:52.597 --> 38:54.331
And even last night,

38:54.333 --> 38:56.766
When we were so desperate
to lose ourselves,

38:56.768 --> 38:58.768
You understood...

38:58.770 --> 39:01.504
Why I couldn't go too far.

39:01.506 --> 39:04.040
You know what
my heart says now?

39:04.042 --> 39:05.909
â™ª

39:05.911 --> 39:09.646
It says that I should forget
about politics and be with you,

39:09.648 --> 39:11.481
No matter what.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.483
You're a true queen,

39:13.485 --> 39:15.485
A queen that any king
would kill for.

39:16.487 --> 39:18.054
But your head says differently.

39:18.056 --> 39:20.056
I understand.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.092
Your instincts
were right.

39:22.094 --> 39:24.094
They'll make you
a great king someday.

39:24.096 --> 39:27.097
â™ª

39:51.722 --> 39:53.990
Clarissa?

39:53.992 --> 39:56.593
I don't know if you're there,

39:56.595 --> 39:58.094
But thank you.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.597
You saved simon's life.

40:00.599 --> 40:03.566
And I suppose you saved mine.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.502
I used to feel so alone here.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.670
I don't anymore.

40:07.672 --> 40:10.907
And I hope you don't, either.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.976
â™ª

40:14.478 --> 40:16.980
(door creaking)
