WEBVTT

00:02.228 --> 00:03.744
<i>Hey, guys!
Paige and Frankie here</i>

00:03.820 --> 00:04.837
with Bernie and Amelia.

00:04.913 --> 00:06.413
Today, we are engaging

00:06.490 --> 00:09.341
in the most extreme sport
ever invented...

00:09.418 --> 00:11.993
All: Riding tricycles!

00:12.071 --> 00:15.422
Amelia:
This is the Vuuugle Grand Prix!

00:15.499 --> 00:17.683
We gotta go fast!

00:17.760 --> 00:19.221
Y... Yeah, seriously, guys,
we gotta go really fast.

00:19.245 --> 00:20.168
We didn't get permission
to do this.

00:20.246 --> 00:21.762
- Oh! So...
- Okay, shoot.

00:21.838 --> 00:22.929
First round,

00:23.006 --> 00:24.097
Frankie versus Bernie.

00:24.174 --> 00:25.190
Bernie: Go!

00:25.267 --> 00:27.008
(screaming)

00:27.086 --> 00:28.602
Go! Go! Go!

00:28.678 --> 00:31.605
(cheering)

00:31.681 --> 00:33.515
Go! Go! Go!

00:33.592 --> 00:34.533
(screams)

00:34.610 --> 00:36.017
(bell dings)

00:36.095 --> 00:37.928
Champion! (Laughs)

00:37.930 --> 00:39.112
Round two, we have got

00:39.189 --> 00:40.873
Paige versus Amelia.

00:40.949 --> 00:42.266
Go!

00:42.268 --> 00:43.617
(screaming)

00:43.693 --> 00:45.026
Yeah! Yeah!

00:45.104 --> 00:46.765
Frankie: Come on! Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

00:46.789 --> 00:48.772
Frankie: Paige! Paige!

00:48.774 --> 00:52.051
(screaming)

00:52.127 --> 00:54.611
Wait, hold up.
Can we see the tape?

00:54.613 --> 00:56.555
Paige: <i>So I did break
the wall of bricks,</i>

00:56.632 --> 00:57.297
<i>but I didn't cross
the finish line,</i>

00:57.374 --> 01:00.059
so, you're the winner!

01:00.135 --> 01:01.451
- (bell dings)
- Woo-hoo!

01:01.453 --> 01:04.471
Final round.
It's Frankie versus Amelia.

01:04.548 --> 01:05.472
And just for fun, we've added
some bowling pins

01:05.549 --> 01:07.549
at the end of the track.

01:07.626 --> 01:08.883
(Frankie and Amelia screaming)

01:08.961 --> 01:09.626
Paige: Go, go, go!

01:09.628 --> 01:11.570
- Go!
- Bernie: Yes!

01:11.647 --> 01:13.647
Go! You got this! You got this!

01:13.723 --> 01:15.315
Paige: Kick it!

01:15.392 --> 01:16.817
(bell dings)

01:16.893 --> 01:17.801
- (cheering)
- Amelia won!

01:17.803 --> 01:19.227
- Woo! Nice job.
- Yay!

01:19.305 --> 01:20.804
- Thank you!
- All right, guys. We... We really gotta

01:20.806 --> 01:21.972
- start cleaning up...
- Okay.

01:21.974 --> 01:23.574
- Oh, shoot. Okay.
- All right, just, go!

01:23.642 --> 01:24.808
Bernie: No way,
you stay and help.

01:24.810 --> 01:25.918
You stay and help!

02:22.576 --> 02:24.054
I'll introduce Bizaardvark's
100th video,

02:24.078 --> 02:25.501
and the banner will explode.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.171
We only get one chance at this,
so we cannot mess it up.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.764
- You ready?
- So ready.

02:29.841 --> 02:31.416
Okay.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.418
Hey, guys, big news!

02:33.420 --> 02:34.822
We're here to celebrate
Bizaardvark's...

02:34.846 --> 02:37.197
Both: 100th video!

02:37.274 --> 02:40.425
Wooo! Wooo!

02:40.427 --> 02:43.111
Wooo!

02:43.188 --> 02:44.446
- Hang on!
- What... Wooo!

02:44.522 --> 02:46.373
You... What...? Paige!

02:46.450 --> 02:50.118
That's $400 worth of pyro!
This better be important!

02:51.939 --> 02:54.030
Hermie seemed sad.

02:54.108 --> 02:56.532
Paige! It's a hermit crab.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.369
They shun people
and lack emotion.

02:59.446 --> 03:03.298
Wait... am I a hermit crab?

03:03.375 --> 03:04.944
Frankie, come on,
Horse Face Guy trusted me

03:04.968 --> 03:06.952
to take care of Hermie
while he's in Fresno

03:06.954 --> 03:08.234
getting his real estate license.

03:08.305 --> 03:09.865
Oh, good for him,
he's finally doing it.

03:11.458 --> 03:15.718
Oh, no, he's barely eaten,
and his energy seems really low.

03:15.796 --> 03:19.072
I think something's wrong.
We need to go get him help.

03:19.149 --> 03:21.444
Oh, uh, uh, how... how about the Vuuugle
channel with the veterinarian?

03:21.468 --> 03:22.968
The Animal Chanimal?

03:22.970 --> 03:25.987
Yeah, I knew the name. I just
like hearing people say it.

03:29.326 --> 03:31.326
Yvette, is Hermie gonna be okay?

03:31.403 --> 03:36.089
Hold up. You're a vet,
and your name is Yvette?

03:36.166 --> 03:37.740
Let me speed this up.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.093
Yes. My name is
Yvette and I'm a vet.

03:40.170 --> 03:43.655
No, I've never fought in a war, so I'm
not Yvette the vet who's also a vet.

03:43.657 --> 03:48.435
But I have a PhD. And a
half a million subscribers.

03:48.512 --> 03:50.232
Now can I please finish
examining this crab?

03:51.498 --> 03:53.515
(giggles) You're Yvette the vet.

03:55.686 --> 03:57.593
Ooh... Paige.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.855
You were right. Something
was wrong with Hermie.

04:00.932 --> 04:02.341
He had a splinter in his claw.

04:02.343 --> 04:05.268
Aw, man, I told him
not to play in the wood chips,

04:05.346 --> 04:10.198
but you know hermit crabs,
they do what they want.

04:10.275 --> 04:12.108
Hey, great call bringing him in.

04:12.186 --> 04:14.610
Have you ever thought
about becoming a veterinarian?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.797
You clearly
have the instinct for it.

04:16.873 --> 04:19.358
Actually, I have.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.543
You have?

04:21.619 --> 04:22.839
Yeah. I mean, you know
how much I love animals.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.674
Being a vet could be
the perfect career for me.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.975
But what about our three-step
plan for the future?

04:28.051 --> 04:29.884
Uh, Bizaardvark goes
on a world tour,

04:29.961 --> 04:31.886
we get super-rich,
then we swim in our pools

04:31.963 --> 04:34.539
full o' hundo dollah bills, yo!

04:34.541 --> 04:38.468
Frankie, you know nobody loves
swimming in hundo dollah bills yo

04:38.545 --> 04:40.636
more than me.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.306
(sighs) But... who knows
what'll happen in the future?

04:43.384 --> 04:45.317
Maybe being a vet is my calling.

04:49.072 --> 04:51.489
If Paige becomes a vet, then
what happens to Bizaardvark?

04:53.076 --> 04:54.334
Hey, guys, I'm Frankie,

04:54.411 --> 04:57.153
and... there's no Paige.

04:57.231 --> 04:58.788
So, there's no Bizaardvark.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.068
♪ Let's not make some videos ♪

05:03.070 --> 05:05.503
Sad! Sad.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.516
<i>♪ Hey, hey! ♪</i>

05:09.593 --> 05:13.094
Thank you again, Mr.
Cunningham, for choosin' me

05:13.171 --> 05:14.929
to do the school's
mornin' announcements.

05:15.006 --> 05:20.101
Amelia, as faculty liaison to the A.V.
Club, I know talent when I see it.

05:20.178 --> 05:23.480
And you, are the only one
that showed up.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.612
I'm excited to be the face of Sierra
High, deliverin' the hard-hittin' news

05:30.688 --> 05:34.115
our students deserve.
Ooh... What's our first story?

05:34.192 --> 05:37.369
Uh, the lunch lady found a baked
potato shaped like a hedgehog.

05:38.955 --> 05:40.547
Let's tell the world!

05:40.624 --> 05:44.125
(news jingle playing)

05:44.202 --> 05:45.385
<i>Good mornin', Sierra High.</i>

05:45.462 --> 05:46.795
<i>I'm Amelia Duckworth,</i>

05:46.871 --> 05:50.949
<i>and these are your
mornin' announcements.</i>

05:50.951 --> 05:51.800
<i>Shockin' news
outta the cafeteria...</i>

05:51.876 --> 05:52.951
Mr. Cunningham: Only one camera.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.877
<i>Shockin' news
outta the cafeteria.</i>

05:54.955 --> 05:59.124
<i>What started out as an
innocent baked potato</i>

05:59.126 --> 06:01.126
<i>turned into a baked potay-no.</i>

06:01.128 --> 06:05.188
<i>The starch in question...</i> -Oh, finally
a room where I can fart alo...

06:07.559 --> 06:09.242
Lone. Fart alone.

06:09.319 --> 06:11.894
(clears throat)
What's happening?

06:11.972 --> 06:14.155
Bernie, I'm doin'
the mornin' announcements.

06:14.232 --> 06:16.641
Whoa, is this camera on?

06:16.643 --> 06:18.643
Sierra High, I will eat you!

06:18.645 --> 06:20.236
Nom! Nom! Nom! Nom! Nom!

06:20.314 --> 06:25.667
Uh, well, we're gonna
take a little break... cut!

06:25.743 --> 06:28.095
Young man, I don't know
who you think you are...

06:28.171 --> 06:31.747
Thank you. -But I think
you're a comedic genius!

06:31.825 --> 06:33.583
- He is?
- I is?

06:33.660 --> 06:37.996
Starting tomorrow, you and Amelia
are gonna co-anchor this show.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.589
What do you say?

06:39.666 --> 06:43.518
A lot of things I immediately
regret I wish you were my dad.

06:43.595 --> 06:45.937
Yeah... Save it for the air, kid.

06:47.691 --> 06:48.691
Mr. Cunningham: Yeah.

06:50.344 --> 06:51.464
What the heck just happened?

06:57.033 --> 06:58.473
Hey, Dr. Yvette,
have you seen Paige?

06:58.519 --> 07:01.019
Oh! Paige, it's you.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.462
And you're holdin' a pig.

07:02.539 --> 07:06.525
And you spun around like a
villain for some reason, heh.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.636
Dr. Yvette said I could start
volunteering with her.

07:09.713 --> 07:12.364
I'm taking care of this little guy
for the day. Do you wanna pet him?

07:12.366 --> 07:16.201
Aww. Aww?

07:16.203 --> 07:21.055
Aww! Aww...

07:21.132 --> 07:24.317
Heh... see? I got there.

07:24.394 --> 07:25.613
So, you ready
to finish our video?

07:25.637 --> 07:27.136
Oh, sorry, I can't.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.713
Gotta stay with this guy.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.232
Plus, I'm lookin' after Hermie,
so, got a lot on my plate.

07:31.309 --> 07:33.476
Oh. Okay, well, uh,
what about tomorrow?

07:33.554 --> 07:37.405
Tomorrow, I'm watching Dr. Yvette
perform surgery on a muskrat.

07:37.482 --> 07:42.818
She says I'll probably only pass out
the first time. It's gonna be great!

07:42.896 --> 07:45.488
Oh, well, um... maybe
we can make a video

07:45.566 --> 07:47.566
when you're not doing vet stuff.

07:47.568 --> 07:50.251
(gasp)
Oh my gosh, did you see that?

07:50.328 --> 07:52.754
Piggy just blinked!
Do it again, Piggy!

07:52.830 --> 07:55.164
Do it again!
(softly) Do it again.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.508
I can blink.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.930
Amelia? Can I talk to you?

08:02.006 --> 08:03.006
Sure.

08:05.419 --> 08:09.754
Paige is getting really serious
about being a vet,

08:09.756 --> 08:11.568
and it's like she doesn't have
time for Bizaardvark anymore.

08:11.592 --> 08:15.594
Oh, honey, I can relate.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.089
See, I joined
the mornin' announcements

08:17.113 --> 08:18.538
to get attention at school.

08:18.615 --> 08:23.025
But now Bernie's doin' it, too,
so I'm gonna get, like...

08:23.103 --> 08:25.770
50 percent less attention
at school!

08:25.772 --> 08:28.456
Oh, I... I don't think
you understand.

08:28.533 --> 08:34.446
Paige and I always talked
about making videos forever.

08:34.448 --> 08:38.132
But if she becomes a vet and doesn't
wanna do Bizaardvark anymore,

08:38.209 --> 08:40.301
I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose my best friend.

08:40.378 --> 08:43.730
No, no, I totally understand.

08:43.807 --> 08:47.976
At first, my face took up
the entire screen.

08:48.052 --> 08:50.295
But now, my face
is gonna take up, like,

08:50.297 --> 08:53.073
50 percent less of the screen!

08:53.149 --> 08:57.226
Amelia, nothing you're saying even
remotely relates to what I'm saying.

08:57.304 --> 09:01.248
Oh... W... Well, I was gonna tell you
the story about my best friend Sage,

09:01.324 --> 09:02.844
who I used to shoot
makeup videos with,

09:02.900 --> 09:05.477
but then she decided
she wanted to become a doctor,

09:05.479 --> 09:10.924
which gave me a lot of fear about the
future of us bein' best friends.

09:11.001 --> 09:13.242
No, but it didn't really seem
like it applied here.

09:13.320 --> 09:17.672
No, that definitely applies.
That's exactly my story.

09:17.749 --> 09:19.674
So, are... are you guys
still best friends?

09:19.751 --> 09:21.826
Oh, no, we never
saw each other again.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.845
And I think about it every day.

09:23.921 --> 09:27.999
That's terrible.
I don't wanna lose Paige.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.668
I have to convince her
not to become a vet.

09:29.670 --> 09:33.171
I have the same problem!

09:33.173 --> 09:35.173
See, there's these
mornin' announcements, right?

09:35.175 --> 09:37.692
- And I have to...
- (screaming)

09:42.940 --> 09:44.340
<i>Hey, guys,
we're here to do the...</i>

09:44.776 --> 09:46.459
No. Um,

09:46.536 --> 09:48.611
I emailed you,
we couldn't get 100 sharks.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.370
Or, um, one shark.

09:49.447 --> 09:50.797
So...

09:50.874 --> 09:54.116
Does anybody have any weird
special skills they can do?

09:54.194 --> 09:55.860
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah!

09:55.862 --> 09:57.028
- Me, I do!
- Oh, cool, okay, let's do that.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.213
Oh. Mine was raising my hand.

09:59.290 --> 10:01.049
I'm gonna do a jump.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.642
Spinny jump.
It's called an axle.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.145
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:05.221 --> 10:06.629
Ooh.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.555
- (laughing)
- Ooh!

10:07.632 --> 10:08.815
(laughing)

10:10.560 --> 10:11.318
Paige/Frankie: Ohh!

10:11.394 --> 10:12.652
So my special skill

10:12.729 --> 10:15.714
is playin' a recorder
through the side of my nose.

10:15.716 --> 10:19.400
(playing
"Mary Had a Little Lamb")

10:19.477 --> 10:21.069
- Woo!
- Wow!

10:21.145 --> 10:24.723
- (plays a few notes)
- (others laughing)

10:24.725 --> 10:26.574
- (plays notes rapidly)
- (others laughing)

10:26.651 --> 10:29.744
- (plays melody)
- Woo!

10:29.821 --> 10:31.396
I can put my lips
to my nose, like this.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.231
- What?
- Wait.

10:33.233 --> 10:33.898
(bell dings)

10:33.900 --> 10:35.734
Are you doing it?

10:35.736 --> 10:36.736
(buzzer)

10:37.995 --> 10:40.347
(buzzer)

10:40.423 --> 10:41.163
- You can't use your fingers!
- You can't...

10:41.241 --> 10:42.073
(buzzer)

10:42.075 --> 10:44.333
I can read minds.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.001
- Okay? Watch this.
- Oh, okay, okay.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.913
- Think of any number between one and 20,
- I know this trick.

10:48.915 --> 10:51.766
And say it kinda slowly,
and I will say the same number.

10:51.843 --> 10:53.079
We can do it five times, ready?

10:53.103 --> 10:55.253
Both: Fifteen.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.271
- (bell dings)
- What?

10:57.348 --> 10:58.365
- Twen...
- Twelve.

10:58.441 --> 11:02.184
- (buzzer)
- (laughing)

11:02.262 --> 11:04.262
<i>♪ Hey, Hey ♪</i>

11:04.264 --> 11:07.782
Okay, Hermie. I need Paige
to think she lost you,

11:07.859 --> 11:09.358
so she'll stop
wanting to be a vet.

11:09.436 --> 11:13.287
I'm sorry. I just can't
lose my best friend.

11:13.364 --> 11:16.165
I don't know if I'm talking
to your face or your butt.

11:20.705 --> 11:22.204
Paige! Paige, come quick,

11:22.282 --> 11:23.715
it's Hermie!

11:27.137 --> 11:28.895
Oh, no... No, no, no,
how did this happen?

11:28.972 --> 11:30.950
I don't know, the cage was
like this when I came in.

11:30.974 --> 11:34.793
(gasp) I must've put it on
the edge and it tipped over.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.979
Oh, this is bad, um... Uh, I'll look
in the lounge, you look in here.

11:38.055 --> 11:39.055
Okay, I'm on it.

11:42.819 --> 11:46.913
Wait, heh... why am I looking?
He's in my backpack.

11:49.734 --> 11:53.144
I looked everywhere.
Hermie's gone.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.807
Horse Face Guy
trusted me and I let him down.

11:54.831 --> 11:57.540
How can I be a vet if people can't
trust me with their animals?

11:59.653 --> 12:01.319
Maybe I shouldn't be a vet.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.930
What? Gosh darn it, no!

12:04.007 --> 12:06.674
I hate it when dreams die.

12:06.751 --> 12:08.601
This really
ruins my day as well!

12:10.997 --> 12:12.513
But, you gotta trust your gut.

12:18.930 --> 12:20.332
Bernie, doin' these
mornin' announcements

12:20.356 --> 12:24.284
really means a lot to me.
Just please take this seriously.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.602
- You got it.
- Okay.

12:26.680 --> 12:30.790
- And...

12:52.296 --> 12:54.630
<i>Adventure? Alpaca my bags.</i>

13:09.055 --> 13:10.571
<i>Fish sticks? Gross.</i>

13:10.648 --> 13:12.557
<i>Alpaca my lunch.</i>

- Is that... laughter?

13:30.076 --> 13:34.020
- (laughter)
- (Bernie and Amelia arguing)

13:36.416 --> 13:39.934
It is! (Sigh)

13:40.011 --> 13:41.528
<i>Thanks for watching, everyone.</i>

13:41.604 --> 13:43.044
<i>She's Amelia,

13:45.258 --> 13:46.424

get the glasses back?</i>

13:46.426 --> 13:48.259
<i>I bought two pairs.</i>

13:48.261 --> 13:49.777
Bernie: <i>Two pairs! Two pairs!</i>

13:49.854 --> 13:54.098
(medley of sound effects)

13:54.100 --> 13:55.283
<i>What if...?</i>

13:55.359 --> 13:56.709

13:56.786 --> 13:58.694
<i>Can we please...?</i>

13:58.772 --> 14:01.439
<i>Cut!</i>

14:01.441 --> 14:02.774
That was awful!

14:02.776 --> 14:05.960
That was amazing!

14:06.037 --> 14:08.537
Kids love your back
and forth bickering.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.975
You keep this up, and you guys'll
be the face of this school

14:11.042 --> 14:15.044
for the next four years!
Huh? (Chuckles)

14:15.121 --> 14:17.138
Bernie, I'm gonna
say this nicely.

14:17.214 --> 14:22.810
I really, really, really, really,
really do not like working with you.

14:22.887 --> 14:25.463
Aw? Only five reallys.

14:25.465 --> 14:29.725
But if us fightin' on screen will
make me the face of this school,

14:29.803 --> 14:31.469
then I'm on board.
What do you say?

14:31.471 --> 14:34.396
I say, alpaca my keyboard!

14:34.474 --> 14:37.141
(alpaca sound)

14:37.143 --> 14:39.160
Oh! I do have the alpaca sound.

14:39.236 --> 14:40.736
(alpaca sound)

14:40.814 --> 14:42.496
I'm fun.

14:47.670 --> 14:50.430
Isn't this great? Paige
and Frankie doing comedy?

14:50.506 --> 14:52.818
You know, I had a dream last night
that we were still doing this

14:52.842 --> 14:54.434
when we were 90.

14:54.510 --> 14:57.662
I had a dream last night where
Hermie yelled "I trusted you,"

14:57.664 --> 15:00.089
and then pushed me off a cliff.

15:00.166 --> 15:03.167
I mean, that... that could
be about anything.

15:03.169 --> 15:06.446
Well, get excited now,
'cause I wrote an awesome song

15:06.522 --> 15:08.339
called "I Can't Stop Smiling."

15:08.341 --> 15:12.360
It's about having over-the-top,
excited reactions to stupid things.

15:22.947 --> 15:26.374
Okay, one thought. You're
gonna wanna join in there.

15:26.450 --> 15:31.696
Yeah, I... I was just... thinkin'
about Hermie's final hours.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.423
He was all alone.
And I was responsible.

I'm sorry, I'm just... too sad
to do Bizaardvark right now.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.340
I'm too sad to do anything
right now.

16:07.417 --> 16:09.583
Paige. No, no, come on, wait.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.847

Here with Bernie Schotz
to do the...

16:27.770 --> 16:29.248
We each get a feather,
and try to blow it

16:29.272 --> 16:31.422
from over there to over here,

16:31.424 --> 16:32.757
in this bucket
without it touching the ground.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.943
Did you steal these feathers
from my favorite boa?

16:36.020 --> 16:38.763
Uh... let's do the challenge!

16:38.765 --> 16:39.765
Go!

16:41.859 --> 16:43.284
- No! No!

16:49.033 --> 16:50.033

- (buzzer)
- Where'd mine go?

16:54.130 --> 16:55.490
- (laughter)
- This is not workin'.

16:56.950 --> 16:57.950
Ready?

17:02.305 --> 17:03.545
- (buzzer)
- Oh!

17:03.623 --> 17:04.623
We got it! We got it!

17:08.294 --> 17:10.606
She, uh... You are so aggressive, you
are just shoving me out of the way.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.645
(bell dings)

17:11.722 --> 17:13.573
Oh! Oh!

17:13.649 --> 17:15.316
(cheering)

17:20.656 --> 17:25.084
Okay, Hermie. I only took you so Paige
would stop wanting to be a vet,

17:25.161 --> 17:28.646
but... I went too far
and was a horrible friend.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.208
It's time to end this, and get
things back to normal around here.

17:32.409 --> 17:35.252
(somber organ music playing)

17:40.994 --> 17:45.438
Oh, sweet mother of all things
unnecessary and borderline hilarious.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.943
Thank you all for coming
to Hermie's funeral.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.780
Horse Face Guy asked me
to put this together.

17:55.599 --> 17:59.010
I'd like to begin
with a few words.

17:59.012 --> 18:01.788
Hermie was a good crustacean.

18:01.864 --> 18:03.289
Group: Mm-hm.

18:05.701 --> 18:07.346
It took him a while
to come out of his shell,

18:07.370 --> 18:10.963
but when he did...
he chose another shell.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.873
That's what hermit crabs do.

18:12.950 --> 18:15.126
- Group: Mmm!
- Preach!

18:17.547 --> 18:19.867
- Paige, I need to talk to you...
- Not now, I'm on a roll.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.051
(sigh)

18:24.128 --> 18:26.037
We're gonna miss you, Hermie.

18:26.039 --> 18:31.209
And now, an In Memoriam tribute
featuring Hermie's happiest times.

18:31.211 --> 18:36.322
(sad keyboard music playing)

18:43.223 --> 18:44.446
Paige, Hermie isn't gone.

18:46.817 --> 18:50.744
You're right.
He's in our hearts.

18:50.821 --> 18:52.541
- So beautiful, Frankie.
- No, no, I mean...

18:54.750 --> 18:58.511
And now, Horse Face Guy would like
to say a few words about Hermie.

18:58.588 --> 19:03.832
Paige, I really need... Wait...
Horse Face Guy's gonna talk?

19:03.910 --> 19:05.350
No one's ever
heard him speak before!

19:08.748 --> 19:10.356
(feedback)

19:15.588 --> 19:16.588
Oh.

19:18.941 --> 19:21.592
He says he can't do it.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.611
Oh... So close!

19:25.098 --> 19:29.283
So sorry, Horse Face Guy.
I'll never forgive myself.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.620
I'm an awful person.

19:32.696 --> 19:36.031
No! I'm an awful person!

19:36.109 --> 19:37.884
You didn't lose Hermie.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.386
- I took him!
- (audience gasps)

19:42.115 --> 19:43.389
What?

19:43.466 --> 19:47.801
Hermie is alive and well
right here in this shoe box!

19:47.878 --> 19:49.136
He isn't gone!

19:53.293 --> 19:56.143
- Okay, he's gone.
- (audience gasps)

19:56.220 --> 19:59.071
- What?
- Uh... He couldn't have gotten far!

19:59.148 --> 20:00.148
Everyone fan out.

20:02.059 --> 20:04.076
Paige, I... I'm so sorry,
let me explain.

20:04.153 --> 20:05.361
- (crunch)
- (all gasp)

20:07.823 --> 20:09.031
It's just a hard shell taco!

20:10.868 --> 20:13.568
How could you do this to me?
What were you thinking?

20:13.646 --> 20:17.481
I wasn't thinking, I just got scared
and did a really stupid thing.

20:17.483 --> 20:19.250
- (crunch)
- (all gasp)

20:22.004 --> 20:22.929
- Peanut shells!
- Others: Ohh...

20:23.005 --> 20:25.264
Clean up
after yourselves, people!

20:28.661 --> 20:30.541
What do you mean you got scared?
Scared of what?

20:31.331 --> 20:34.440
Scared of losing you
as my best friend.

20:34.517 --> 20:36.758
What? How could that happen?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.956
We've always said we're gonna
be best friends forever.

20:39.005 --> 20:42.523
Yeah, but we also said that were
were always gonna do comedy forever,

20:42.599 --> 20:44.283
- and now you wanna be a vet.
- (scoffs)

20:44.360 --> 20:47.361
I don't know what I wanna be.

20:47.438 --> 20:48.937
I love Bizaardvark,
I love animals.

20:49.015 --> 20:53.275
I also love taking care
of people, and I might wanna

20:53.353 --> 20:55.353
open my own bed and
breakfast in New Mexico.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.413
(gasp) You'd be so good at that!

20:59.450 --> 21:02.543
Look, I don't know the future.

21:02.619 --> 21:05.963
Only thing I do know, is that you're
always gonna be my best friend.

21:07.700 --> 21:11.218
Thanks, Paige. I'm sorry.

21:11.295 --> 21:13.637
- Love you.
- Love you more.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.133
Now let's go find Hermie.

21:18.211 --> 21:21.712
- (crunch)
- (all gasp)

21:21.714 --> 21:25.399
Oh... Same taco shell as
before, that's on us.

21:28.571 --> 21:30.496
Horse Face Guy,
you found Hermie!

21:30.573 --> 21:33.115
(clapping and cheering)

21:36.729 --> 21:39.079
I spent all night
preparin' insults.

21:39.156 --> 21:40.339
I hope you're ready.

21:40.416 --> 21:42.583
Oh, I'm ready,
but I gotta warn you,

21:42.659 --> 21:44.844
things are gonna get
pretty personal.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.130
Thank you, "Uncle Wacky's
Zany Joke Book for Kids."

21:50.000 --> 21:51.684
And, we are on.

21:51.761 --> 21:54.578
(news jingle playing)

21:54.580 --> 21:56.505
<i>Good mornin', Sierra High.</i>

21:56.582 --> 21:57.248
<i>I'm Amelia Duckworth.</i>

21:57.250 --> 21:59.917
<i>And I'm Bernie Schotz.</i>

21:59.919 --> 22:01.321
<i>And these are your
morning announcements.</i>

22:01.345 --> 22:03.754
<i>Our lead story involves
the new equipment</i>

22:03.756 --> 22:07.182
<i>- in the science department...
- Speaking of food,</i>

22:07.260 --> 22:08.754
<i>what does Amelia
and my favorite lunch</i>

22:08.778 --> 22:10.444
<i>have in common?</i>

22:10.521 --> 22:13.539
<i>They're both full of baloney!</i>

22:13.616 --> 22:16.375
<i>Oh my, Bernie,
we are fightin' now!</i>

22:16.452 --> 22:19.211
<i>Heh! Speakin' of baloney,</i>

22:19.288 --> 22:20.604
<i>(sniffs) is... is that
what I smell,</i>

22:20.606 --> 22:21.726
<i>or is that low self-esteem,</i>

22:21.791 --> 22:24.032
<i>mixed with your awful B.O.?</i>

22:24.110 --> 22:25.943
(laughs)

22:25.945 --> 22:27.669
<i>Huh... ohh... heh.</i>

22:30.040 --> 22:34.118
(clears throat) <i>Well,
uh... uh, when you talk,</i>

22:34.120 --> 22:35.953
<i>you're like a balloon,</i>

22:35.955 --> 22:37.346
<i>because you're full of hot air.</i>

22:38.958 --> 22:41.642
<i>Speakin' of air,</i>

22:41.718 --> 22:43.627
<i>your breath smells
like dead slugs,</i>

22:43.629 --> 22:45.129
<i>which is why you've
never kissed a girl,</i>

22:45.131 --> 22:47.356
<i>and will probably spend
the rest of your life alone!</i>

22:49.151 --> 22:51.410
<i>Um... I... T... I'm...</i>

22:51.487 --> 22:53.487
<i>I think that...</i>

22:53.564 --> 22:55.247
<i>I bet everyone's lovin' this!</i>

22:58.661 --> 23:02.571
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, uh,</i>
(clears throat)

23:02.648 --> 23:04.924
<i>What did the duck...
What did the duck say</i>

23:05.000 --> 23:06.834
<i>when he bought lipstick?</i>

23:06.910 --> 23:08.544
<i>P... P... P... Put... Put it
on my bill.</i>

23:10.656 --> 23:11.989
<i>That made no sense.</i>

23:11.991 --> 23:13.432
<i>Kinda like your life.</i>

23:13.509 --> 23:17.495
<i>We get it. No one respects
you, Bernie Schotz.</i>

23:17.497 --> 23:19.163
(humming)

23:19.165 --> 23:20.347
We're cutting!

23:22.668 --> 23:24.668
Amelia. What was that?

23:24.670 --> 23:28.763
You embarrassed Bernie
in front of the entire school.

23:28.841 --> 23:29.448
I'm afraid your
morning announcement days

23:29.525 --> 23:30.616
are over.

23:30.693 --> 23:33.010
What?

23:33.012 --> 23:35.621
Bernie... think you can handle
this gig on your own? Eh?

23:37.350 --> 23:38.782
I just wanted a fart room.

23:43.706 --> 23:47.858
Amelia... how would you like
to be the face of Sierra High?

23:47.860 --> 23:50.469
That's all I ever wanted!

23:50.546 --> 23:53.881
<i>Good mornin', Sierra High!</i>

23:53.957 --> 23:55.435
<i>- Today's lead story...</i>
- Wrong camera.

23:55.459 --> 23:57.368
<i>Today's lead story...</i>

23:57.370 --> 24:02.981
<i>Amelia Duckworth's back on top!</i>
