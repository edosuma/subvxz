02:15:31.694 --> 02:15:34.823
Because you look
the way you do.

02:15:34.897 --> 02:15:36.422
You think if you were
better-looking,

02:15:36.499 --> 02:15:38.991
you wouldn't have to work so
hard getting women to like you?

02:15:39.068 --> 02:15:41.366
-- No. -- You think
you're good-looking?

02:15:41.437 --> 02:15:43.337
-- Can we talk about something else?
-- We only have a few minutes left.

02:15:43.406 --> 02:15:45.033
Let's try and get
some work done.

02:15:45.107 --> 02:15:46.404
Do you think
you're good-looking?

02:15:46.476 --> 02:15:48.001
-- I think I'm all right.
-- Of course you do.

02:15:48.077 --> 02:15:51.638
You can't get over how
good-looking you are. So...

02:15:51.714 --> 02:15:53.739
this thing must come

02:15:53.816 --> 02:15:56.911
from someplace
inside of you,

02:15:56.986 --> 02:15:59.978
something so fundamentally bad

02:16:00.056 --> 02:16:03.822
that you feel it must
either be overcome

02:16:03.893 --> 02:16:04.883
or covered up,

02:16:04.961 --> 02:16:07.487
lest the entire world
run away from you,

02:16:07.563 --> 02:16:10.055
not unlike two other
people you know.

02:16:13.369 --> 02:16:15.997
Have you noticed how you
always come back to my parents

02:16:16.072 --> 02:16:19.303
at the end of each session?

02:16:19.375 --> 02:16:21.503
Well, the session's over.

02:16:21.577 --> 02:16:23.341
What was the point of this?

02:16:25.448 --> 02:16:27.439
In the long run,

02:16:27.517 --> 02:16:30.543
to relieve you of the pressure
of getting people to like you.

02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:33.021
In the short run,
to tell you this --

02:16:33.089 --> 02:16:36.582
-- What? -- Stop trying
to get me to like you.

02:16:36.659 --> 02:16:38.286
-- I haven't been --
-- You've been flirting with me.

02:16:38.361 --> 02:16:40.159
And I want you to
take this seriously.

02:16:40.228 --> 02:16:42.823
I do take this seriously.

02:16:45.902 --> 02:16:47.563
Okay.

02:16:47.637 --> 02:16:48.661
I wasn't flirting.

02:16:48.737 --> 02:16:50.035
Okay.

02:16:50.106 --> 02:16:51.800
I'm a charming guy, Abby.

02:16:51.874 --> 02:16:53.968
It's not something
I can control.

02:16:54.043 --> 02:16:55.511
Tell me about it.

02:16:55.577 --> 02:16:57.171
You know what I think?

02:16:57.245 --> 02:16:58.714
Next week.

02:16:58.781 --> 02:17:01.977
I think we could end this
whole thing right now.

02:17:02.050 --> 02:17:04.019
-- <i>If</i> I <i>just did what?</i>
-- <i>Told me that you liked me.</i>

02:17:04.085 --> 02:17:06.111
-- I <i>know.</i> -- <i>I'd be cured
right away, nextcase.</i>

02:17:06.188 --> 02:17:07.815
Not gonna happen.

02:17:07.889 --> 02:17:10.450
[Sighs deeply] I remind
you that it is my money.

02:17:10.526 --> 02:17:12.324
And I want you
to bear in mind

02:17:12.395 --> 02:17:14.692
that you're the patient,
I'm the doctor,

02:17:14.763 --> 02:17:15.993
and you're in pain.

02:17:16.065 --> 02:17:18.591
I have no trouble
remembering that last part.

02:17:18.668 --> 02:17:20.295
I'll see you next week.

02:17:22.972 --> 02:17:24.496
Watch me
on television tonight.

02:17:24.574 --> 02:17:25.735
Why?

02:17:25.808 --> 02:17:27.037
You'll like me.

02:17:27.109 --> 02:17:29.043
-- See ya.
-- That was a <i>joke.</i>

02:17:29.111 --> 02:17:30.202
-- You <i>know</i> what?
-- What?

02:17:30.279 --> 02:17:31.007
It wasn't.

02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:39.418
[Door closes]

02:17:45.695 --> 02:17:48.528
[indistinct voices]

02:17:53.402 --> 02:17:54.630
-- Kim...
-- Yeah?

02:17:54.704 --> 02:17:56.672
I kind of wanted
to put you on alert.

02:17:56.739 --> 02:17:58.228
What do you mean?

02:17:58.307 --> 02:18:00.401
You know how ordinarily I flirt
with you during the show?

02:18:00.476 --> 02:18:01.500
Yeah.

02:18:01.576 --> 02:18:03.602
-- I won't be doing that.
-- Okay.

02:18:03.679 --> 02:18:05.147
-- It's not that I don't like you.
-- Okay.

02:18:05.214 --> 02:18:07.182
Even more important, it's not
that I don't want you to like me.

02:18:07.249 --> 02:18:08.182
I do like you.

02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:12.788
All right.

02:18:12.855 --> 02:18:15.017
Well...

02:18:15.091 --> 02:18:16.581
keep ii UP-

02:18:16.659 --> 02:18:18.650
Okay.

02:18:23.232 --> 02:18:24.324
-- Alyson...
-- Yeah?

02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:26.129
I won't be flirting
with you tonight.

02:18:26.201 --> 02:18:28.967
You shouldn't be alarmed. It's
just something that I'm trying.

02:18:29.038 --> 02:18:31.097
It's gonna be hard,
but I think it's important.

02:18:31.173 --> 02:18:32.106
Okay.

02:18:32.174 --> 02:18:33.232
So here I go.

02:18:33.308 --> 02:18:34.708
<i>Kim: Five minutes to air.</i>

02:18:34.777 --> 02:18:36.472
<i>First team
to the studio, please.</i>

02:18:36.545 --> 02:18:38.478
<i>Five minutes.</i>

02:18:42.785 --> 02:18:45.083
<i>He just got off the plane. He's
on his way in from La Guardia.</i>

02:18:45.154 --> 02:18:46.621
I'm saying, why doesn't
he have the names?

02:18:46.689 --> 02:18:48.350
They're gonna be faxed
to him when he gets here.

02:18:48.424 --> 02:18:49.892
-- Tina's all set?
-- She's in hair.

02:18:49.959 --> 02:18:52.519
Let's see if we can get this
thing on the air tonight.

02:18:52.594 --> 02:18:53.562
We will.

02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:56.155
-- Oh, Jocelyn.
-- Please stop that.

02:18:56.232 --> 02:18:58.462
-- I'm assuming you fired him.
-- You know what?

02:18:58.534 --> 02:19:00.058
-- What? -- He's J.J.'s cousin,
so why don't we give him --

02:19:00.136 --> 02:19:01.763
-- Jeremy, I know he's J.J.'s cousin.
-- And?

02:19:01.837 --> 02:19:04.032
-- I could honestly give a damn. --
Is it necessary to go out of your way

02:19:04.106 --> 02:19:06.665
-- to pick fights with the network?
-- No.

02:19:06.742 --> 02:19:09.005
Is it necessary to go out of
your way to kiss their ass?

02:19:09.077 --> 02:19:10.307
That's not what I'm doing.

02:19:10.379 --> 02:19:11.608
-- Jeremy...
-- No, I mean it.

02:19:11.681 --> 02:19:12.772
This is their network, Natalie.

02:19:12.848 --> 02:19:13.974
We have to work
with these people.

02:19:14.049 --> 02:19:15.779
And the special delight
that you and Dana take in --

02:19:15.851 --> 02:19:18.683
-- You don't know what you're talking
about. -- I do know what I'm talking about.

02:19:18.754 --> 02:19:21.120
They keep us on the air when
our ratings don't support it,

02:19:21.190 --> 02:19:22.555
and their paychecks
don't bounce.

02:19:22.625 --> 02:19:25.026
I consider neither of those to be
magnanimous gestures worthy --

02:19:25.093 --> 02:19:26.186
-- I didn't -- -- worthy
of keeping somebody on

02:19:26.262 --> 02:19:28.629
who very nearly cost us
the show last night.

02:19:28.698 --> 02:19:30.462
Cost us the show?
It was a hockey game.

02:19:30.532 --> 02:19:32.297
He screwed up.
It wasn't the first time.

02:19:32.368 --> 02:19:35.303
His attitude sucks, and I don't
care if his cousin's Thomas Edison.

02:19:35.370 --> 02:19:37.031
Get him outta here.

02:19:37.106 --> 02:19:39.598
-- I'll do it during the first C-break.
-- Thank you.

02:19:40.809 --> 02:19:43.780
<i>Dana, stop sacking Dave.</i>

02:19:43.846 --> 02:19:46.906
See, you keep your center of
gravity low and your feet moving.

02:19:46.982 --> 02:19:47.972
Dana...

02:19:48.049 --> 02:19:50.075
-- Can I sit down?
-- [ Panting ] Okay.

Loading 5, F/X 1, 2, and 2A.

02:19:55.758 --> 02:19:57.692

That was nice.

02:20:28.124 --> 02:20:29.853
-- "Experiencing"?
-- Yeah.

02:20:29.925 --> 02:20:31.984
You didn't mind
that I changed it?

No.

02:20:42.204 --> 02:20:44.195
I'm not gonna
flirt with you tonight.

-- Yeah.

02:20:45.775 --> 02:20:46.867
Okay.

02:20:46.942 --> 02:20:49.434
-- Ordinarily, I'd flirt with you.
-- I like it.

02:20:49.512 --> 02:20:52.311
I appreciate that, but tonight
it's not gonna happen that much,

02:20:52.381 --> 02:20:54.440
and I didn't want you
to get the wrong idea.

02:20:54.517 --> 02:20:56.747
That you don't like me?

02:20:56.819 --> 02:20:57.980
Not so much that

want you to like me.

You've been falling down
on the job.

a little at first,

don't even want this job.

I don't.

02:21:32.655 --> 02:21:34.419
Why are you here?

02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:37.323
Um, it puts pizza money in my
pocket till I get out of school.

Well, that notwithstanding,

02:22:58.440 --> 02:22:59.771
you're one pretty little girl.

02:22:59.842 --> 02:23:01.332
As a matter of fact,
you're wrong.

02:23:01.410 --> 02:23:02.900
As a matter of fact,
I happen to be

02:23:02.978 --> 02:23:04.969
the only person here who
isn't acting emotionally.

02:23:05.047 --> 02:23:06.446
I'm the one who's
saying, "Yes,

02:23:06.515 --> 02:23:08.313
"they're bullies, and
we've never gotten along.

long before I got here.

self-preservation,

why not try to make it work?"

02:23:13.522 --> 02:23:15.547
I'm throwing them one.

02:23:15.624 --> 02:23:18.594
I'm saying, let's let this
one thing not be a hassle.

02:23:18.661 --> 02:23:19.719
[Sighs]

02:23:22.231 --> 02:23:23.960
What did he say
when you talked to him?

02:23:24.033 --> 02:23:25.228
-- He said he'd try harder.
-- Did he?

02:23:25.301 --> 02:23:26.462
-- Yes.
-- Really?

02:23:26.535 --> 02:23:28.094
Those weren't his exact words.

02:23:28.170 --> 02:23:29.865
-- What were his exact wor--
-- "Get off my back."

02:23:29.939 --> 02:23:31.407
That's not me saying that.

02:23:31.473 --> 02:23:33.464
I'm saying those were
his exact words.

02:23:33.542 --> 02:23:36.375
He's your responsibility,
Jeremy. Do what you want.

02:23:36.445 --> 02:23:38.880
He screws up again,
it's my responsibility.

02:23:38.948 --> 02:23:39.881
Got it.

02:23:39.949 --> 02:23:41.246
-- Jeremy?
-- Yep?

02:23:41.317 --> 02:23:43.684
Being emotional about their
work never killed anybody.

-- My point <i>was</i> --
-- <i>I know what your point was.</i>

Yeah.

You don't think
it's going well?

You know, banter
with you about it,

02:24:26.795 --> 02:24:29.628
I'll just leave it at that.

02:24:29.698 --> 02:24:32.395
Dan, it's -- it's not
like if you chat with me,

02:24:32.468 --> 02:24:34.197
I'm gonna go home with you.

02:24:35.504 --> 02:24:36.665
Why not?

02:24:36.739 --> 02:24:38.138
-- What?
-- Never mind.

02:24:38.207 --> 02:24:40.403
Dan, you're having
a bad night.

02:24:40.476 --> 02:24:41.534
Yeah.

02:24:41.610 --> 02:24:44.272
But could we just
chalk it up to that

02:24:44.346 --> 02:24:46.610
and not, you know,
come to some

02:24:46.682 --> 02:24:49.879
general conclusion about me
as a result of it?

02:24:49.952 --> 02:24:53.115
I hardly ever understand
what you're saying.

02:24:53.188 --> 02:24:54.815
I've gotten that before.

02:24:54.890 --> 02:24:56.358
Try and keep it
together, huh?

02:24:57.292 --> 02:24:58.282
Sure.

Yes.

02:25:09.538 --> 02:25:11.006
What's wrong?

02:25:11.073 --> 02:25:12.507
She thinks I'm crazy.

02:25:12.574 --> 02:25:14.338
-- You are crazy.
-- You're not helping.

02:25:14.410 --> 02:25:15.935
I wasn't trying to.

02:25:16.011 --> 02:25:18.446
Abby thinks my flirting
is unhealthy.

02:25:18.514 --> 02:25:19.777
Who's Abby?

02:25:19.848 --> 02:25:21.873
-- My therapist. Are you
paying attention? -- No.

02:25:21.950 --> 02:25:23.714
The thing is,
she may have a point.

Who?

02:25:24.853 --> 02:25:25.843
Abby.

-- Danny...
-- Yeah?

-- You're not flirting with
me right now, right? -- No.

-- Good.
-- I'm saying that --

02:25:32.761 --> 02:25:34.627
-- 'Cause that'd just be strange.
-- I know.

Not that I wouldn't
be flattered...

that...you look good?

you meant by "creepy"?
