01:21.699 --> 01:23.200
Bar baby!

01:23.201 --> 01:26.704
Yeah, I heard she
was born in a bar.

01:34.212 --> 01:37.715
<i>You could shake your knuckles at the sky.</i>

01:42.720 --> 01:46.223
<i>You could get mad and say,
"I don't got nothing."</i>

01:53.731 --> 01:56.016
<i>You could get stuck.</i>

01:59.654 --> 02:03.357
Happy birthday, baby!

02:09.531 --> 02:14.536
Oh! This one's from me.

02:14.536 --> 02:15.587
This one,
I don't know.

02:15.587 --> 02:17.755
I think this is
from your uncle.

02:17.755 --> 02:19.256
Cute!

02:26.848 --> 02:29.884
Whoa, hey, a pistol for a pistol.

02:31.769 --> 02:34.721
Luli.

02:37.559 --> 02:39.060
All right, folks,
these drinks

02:39.060 --> 02:41.062
aren't going to
drink themselves.

02:41.062 --> 02:43.447
This is a party.

03:22.520 --> 03:27.107
Luli, you're doomed.

03:27.108 --> 03:30.111
You know that?

03:35.250 --> 03:39.287
I mean, just look at him.

03:40.922 --> 03:44.425
You know why
you keep losing?

03:44.425 --> 03:47.428
'Cause you're
a big fucking loser!

04:00.808 --> 04:03.310
You motherless fuck!

04:03.311 --> 04:06.113
You're not going anywhere
like that, you son of a bitch!

04:08.116 --> 04:10.568
Luli, get in the car.
Luli!

04:10.568 --> 04:11.569
Just get in the car.

04:11.569 --> 04:13.571
Luli, no, no!

04:13.571 --> 04:16.290
No, you are not
killing my daughter,

04:16.291 --> 04:17.909
not on her birthday,
goddamn it!

04:17.909 --> 04:19.459
No, we're not
going to do it.

04:19.459 --> 04:22.496
Don't know how to show his
love and I'm sorry for that.

04:22.497 --> 04:24.499
I should have
never married him!

04:24.499 --> 04:26.300
I should have never
married him.

04:26.301 --> 04:28.803
Luli, listen to me!
Let's go!

04:28.803 --> 04:30.387
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

04:30.388 --> 04:33.340
Oh, God.
Please, baby, believe me.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.343
You fucking ass.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.595
Hey, hey, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

04:37.595 --> 04:39.930
Come here. Get off her, Tammy.
Come on, Luli.

04:39.931 --> 04:42.433
I'll take you home.
Jesus Christ.

04:42.433 --> 04:43.434
Sorry about that!

04:43.434 --> 04:44.902
Oh, please.

04:44.902 --> 04:47.354
It's none of your
business, Ray!

04:47.355 --> 04:48.356
Shut up, Tammy.

04:48.356 --> 04:51.859
Ray, Sorry, man.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.360
Goddamn, Nick.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.363
Like the
truck, though.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.864
Yeah, yeah.

04:56.864 --> 05:01.168
Ray!

05:20.138 --> 05:23.057
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

05:23.057 --> 05:27.528
Did you fire six
shots or five?

05:27.528 --> 05:32.399
Now ask yourself,
do I feel lucky?

05:32.400 --> 05:36.120
Well, do you, punk?

05:36.120 --> 05:39.239
Pow, pow, pow,
pow, pow, pow.

06:02.146 --> 06:03.730
Oh...

06:03.731 --> 06:05.733
Get down.
Okay.

06:05.733 --> 06:06.934
Get down.
Okay.

06:06.934 --> 06:10.020
Do you always carry
a gun like that?

06:10.021 --> 06:13.524
That's not a gun. It's a .45,
Smith & Wesson.

06:13.524 --> 06:16.026
Well, maybe you could
give your mom my card.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.361
Let her know
I dropped by.

06:17.362 --> 06:18.863
Who are you, mister?

06:18.863 --> 06:20.364
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

06:20.365 --> 06:22.867
I should introduce myself.
I'm Lux Feld.

06:22.867 --> 06:23.617
I'm in investments.

06:23.618 --> 06:26.120
Investments?

06:26.120 --> 06:30.507
Yeah, you know, land,
property, stuff like that.

06:32.510 --> 06:36.263
Well, Lux Feld, you always
break into people's houses

06:36.264 --> 06:39.383
at 8:00
in the morning?

06:39.384 --> 06:41.886
No, you're door--

06:41.886 --> 06:43.804
Screen door was open and
there was no doorbell, so--

06:43.805 --> 06:46.641
Do you think I'm pretty?

06:46.641 --> 06:48.859
Excuse me?

06:48.860 --> 06:53.364
Like if you saw me on
the street or something,

06:53.364 --> 06:56.867
would you want
to kiss me?

06:56.868 --> 07:00.371
I don't think
I'm supposed to--

07:00.371 --> 07:04.875
No, I'm not. I'm-- Okay.

07:08.296 --> 07:11.415
Luli, what in the hell is--
Oh, Mr. Feld.

07:11.416 --> 07:14.469
Wow, you're here
at 7:00 a.m.

07:14.469 --> 07:18.139
It's actually 8:00,
Mrs. Cutter.

07:18.139 --> 07:22.143
Luli, you are such
a card with that gun.

07:22.143 --> 07:23.144
It's not a gun.
It's a .45.

07:23.144 --> 07:24.512
Well, put it down.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.013
Smith & Wesson.

07:26.013 --> 07:29.099
It's a Smith
& Wesson .45.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.602
Are you afraid of the dark at all?

07:31.602 --> 07:33.604
What are you implying?

07:33.604 --> 07:34.605
Well, I mean,
you know,

07:34.605 --> 07:36.607
the woods can be a
little dark at night.

07:36.607 --> 07:37.491
Oh, no!

07:47.201 --> 07:49.703
Here it is. Yeah.

07:49.704 --> 07:50.705
Oh, my!

07:50.705 --> 07:51.706
Yeah, it's a Cadillac.

07:51.706 --> 07:55.092
This is from all those
houses you buy and sell?

07:55.092 --> 07:59.212
Hell, when I do well
(Unclear).

08:07.855 --> 08:11.859
Ready?

08:11.859 --> 08:13.861
You ready?

08:13.861 --> 08:16.697
Yeah.
Let's go.

08:28.493 --> 08:29.627
Where she at?

08:29.627 --> 08:32.630
Hm?

08:32.630 --> 08:36.133
Your mother.

08:36.133 --> 08:38.919
She left.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.924
With who?

08:42.924 --> 08:46.427
Somebody.

08:46.427 --> 08:50.931
Somebody who?

08:50.932 --> 08:52.433
Some guy.

08:52.433 --> 08:54.351
Got a bigger car.

08:57.738 --> 09:02.743
His name is Lux.

09:02.743 --> 09:06.863
Mm.

09:07.865 --> 09:09.533
Oh, now....

09:14.539 --> 09:17.792
It's funny, you know,
in this light,

09:17.792 --> 09:21.428
you look just like your
mother when I first met her,

09:21.429 --> 09:25.883
just blonde and pretty.

09:29.887 --> 09:31.355
Let me tell
you something.

09:38.312 --> 09:41.815
Just stay sweet.

10:11.479 --> 10:14.148
<i>Did you know I have a baby brother?</i>

10:14.148 --> 10:17.901
<i>It's good my mama
had a baby-blue dress</i>

10:17.902 --> 10:21.438
<i>that didn't come
down far enough.</i>

10:21.439 --> 10:24.775
<i>And my dad liked her
in that dress.</i>

10:24.775 --> 10:29.663
<i>And well,
next thing you know,</i>

10:29.664 --> 10:33.668
<i>she looked like she
swallowed a basketball.</i>

10:33.668 --> 10:35.336
<i>And even though
I was only seven</i>

10:35.336 --> 10:37.838
<i>and didn't know
why my mama</i>

10:37.838 --> 10:39.339
<i>swallowed
a basketball</i>

10:39.340 --> 10:41.425
<i>or how that made
a baby brother,</i>

10:41.425 --> 10:44.928
<i>well, I couldn't
help but smile</i>

10:44.929 --> 10:48.799
<i>when I saw my daddy
float through that door.</i>

10:48.799 --> 10:51.551
<i>And they had a Sunday with
everyone coming over</i>

10:51.552 --> 10:53.937
<i>and bringing gifts
and a little baby crib.</i>

10:53.938 --> 10:57.942
'Cause it was like all
the "Hi, how are yous"

10:57.942 --> 10:59.944
and "Well, hello, sunshines"
in the county

10:59.944 --> 11:03.447
had decided to march
down that there dirt road

11:03.447 --> 11:05.949
in the light just this
once around my mama,

11:05.950 --> 11:08.786
sitting proud and pretty

11:08.786 --> 11:11.155
in that little blue dress
that started it all.

11:21.799 --> 11:24.802
Ooh, can't you feel
the breeze from the subway?

11:24.802 --> 11:26.804
Isn't it delicious?

11:33.928 --> 11:35.646
Help me,
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

11:35.646 --> 11:39.650
You're my only hope.

11:40.651 --> 11:42.519
I am big.

11:42.520 --> 11:46.524
It's the pictures
that got small.

11:51.245 --> 11:54.865
<i>Life, love, luck.</i>

11:56.784 --> 12:00.287
<i>Las Vegas!</i>

12:00.287 --> 12:02.172
<i>High rollers.</i>

12:02.173 --> 12:04.041
<i>Big money.</i>

12:04.041 --> 12:08.962
<i>Beautiful girls.</i>

12:08.963 --> 12:12.549
<i>Come to Las Vegas,</i>

12:12.550 --> 12:14.351
<i>America's desert
playground.</i>

12:20.975 --> 12:23.978
This house is just a pig fuck.

12:55.843 --> 12:56.894
Say, that's not yours, see?

12:56.894 --> 12:58.896
You ain't got
no right, see?

12:58.896 --> 13:00.397
Well, then, now, pilgrim,

13:00.397 --> 13:02.599
like you got
yourself a choice.

13:02.600 --> 13:06.604
You can either be one of
the men in black,

13:06.604 --> 13:11.108
or one of the
ones in white.

13:11.108 --> 13:15.612
Think fast there,
pilgrim.

14:02.459 --> 14:04.961
So long, suckers.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.205
Where are you headed?

14:51.208 --> 14:52.676
Las Vegas.

14:52.676 --> 14:56.179
Aren't you
a little bit young?

14:56.180 --> 14:58.382
Maybe say innocent, to travel
to Las Vegas all by yourself?

14:58.382 --> 15:02.386
No.

15:02.386 --> 15:03.887
What about you, mister?
Where are you headed?

15:03.888 --> 15:07.391
My name's not mister.

15:07.391 --> 15:08.225
It's Eddie.

15:08.225 --> 15:10.777
Eddie.

15:10.778 --> 15:13.781
So you some kind
of runaway?

15:13.781 --> 15:17.234
No, my dad
left me.

15:17.234 --> 15:19.369
Really?

15:19.370 --> 15:21.872
Yeah, and then
my mama died.

15:21.872 --> 15:22.873
And then I was
raised by nuns.

15:22.873 --> 15:24.875
And they left me, so I'm
just stuck on this road.

15:24.875 --> 15:25.876
All right, so what's
your dad look like?

15:25.876 --> 15:26.793
Maybe I've seen him.

15:26.794 --> 15:28.796
You?

15:36.720 --> 15:39.889
Oh, my Lord, what in the world
is in store for me here?

15:39.890 --> 15:41.892
You're gonna sit there and
laugh at yourself all day

15:41.892 --> 15:43.093
or are you gonna
let me in?

15:43.093 --> 15:46.096
Don't just stand there.

15:46.096 --> 15:46.980
Get in if you want.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.115
Two folks heading west,

16:05.115 --> 16:07.033
they ought to help
each other out, right?

16:13.290 --> 16:16.009
Come on, now.
I ain't got all day.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.124
You mind if I
ask you something?

16:48.125 --> 16:51.128
Shoot.

16:51.128 --> 16:54.464
Why you got
that limp?

16:54.465 --> 16:58.469
I used to buck
broncos for the rodeo.

16:58.469 --> 17:01.472
Started just as a
buckaroo but, you know,

17:01.472 --> 17:03.390
ranch work and putting down
horses, that ain't for me.

17:15.903 --> 17:19.323
Are you hungry?
We can stop and get a ruby.

17:19.323 --> 17:20.156
You ever had a ruby?

17:20.156 --> 17:22.108
No.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.111
You should.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.612
They say it's the
celebrity of sandwiches.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.581
You can be a celebrity.

17:28.582 --> 17:29.916
I think we
can both agree

17:29.917 --> 17:33.420
you cannot be the
celebrity of sandwiches.

17:47.101 --> 17:50.888
You mind not looking over
here for a little while?

18:01.982 --> 18:04.234
That don't match.

18:04.234 --> 18:06.369
What?

18:06.370 --> 18:07.821
Well, it don't match
unless you're a hooker.

18:07.821 --> 18:11.708
Oh, so now
I'm a hooker?

18:13.210 --> 18:15.212
Well, darn you're
too ripe is all.

18:15.212 --> 18:16.413
Excuse me?

18:16.413 --> 18:18.548
I said you're too ripe
and your mouth is too big.

18:18.549 --> 18:20.050
Well, like it's
to big in general

18:20.050 --> 18:21.418
or like I talk too much?

18:21.418 --> 18:23.837
Well, both.

18:27.341 --> 18:30.344
Yeah, well, what do
you know anyways?

18:30.344 --> 18:31.645
Gimp.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.352
Now, you
listen to me.

18:39.353 --> 18:42.356
If you ever, ever
call me that again,

18:42.356 --> 18:44.358
I will throw you straight
through this windshield

18:44.358 --> 18:46.360
and then I will run
you over after that.

18:46.360 --> 18:49.363
Understood?

18:55.702 --> 18:58.287
Go on, say it.

18:58.288 --> 19:02.792
Say it.

19:02.793 --> 19:05.679
Say the word.
Let me out.

19:05.679 --> 19:07.130
The door's right there.
Feel free to use it.

19:22.062 --> 19:24.064
Gimp.

19:28.202 --> 19:29.703
Gimp!

20:28.045 --> 20:30.380
Jesus, Lady!
Lord!

20:30.380 --> 20:32.382
You almost pissed
on my head.

20:32.382 --> 20:34.133
Holy fucker, kid.

20:34.134 --> 20:36.636
You know you can give
someone a heart attack

20:36.637 --> 20:38.555
yelping out from
a ditch like that.

20:38.555 --> 20:40.056
Wait. How do you pee
standing up like that?

20:40.057 --> 20:41.558
I mean, don't you have
to squat a little?

20:41.558 --> 20:43.059
I always gotta
squat a little.

20:43.060 --> 20:44.561
Nah, not if
you're smart.

20:44.561 --> 20:46.062
You just find where
the hill goes down,

20:46.063 --> 20:47.781
move your feet out
the way and shoot.

20:47.781 --> 20:50.316
So you gonna tell me what
you're doing out here or what?

20:50.317 --> 20:52.702
We got in a fight.

20:52.703 --> 20:54.788
Oh, boyfriend.

20:54.788 --> 20:59.209
Nah, no, no, just some guy
who fell in love with me.

20:59.209 --> 21:01.661
That so?

21:01.662 --> 21:03.213
Yeah. Yeah, and then he
freaked out on me.

21:03.213 --> 21:06.716
So I looked him straight in the
eye and I said, "Let me out."

21:08.218 --> 21:09.219
Yeah, you know,
he tried to make me stay.

21:09.219 --> 21:10.720
He begged me, actually.

21:10.721 --> 21:12.723
But no. No, ma'am.

21:12.723 --> 21:15.809
I just left him there
in the middle of nowhere.

21:15.809 --> 21:17.594
Well, kid, good luck.

21:17.594 --> 21:18.595
Stay straight.
See you around.

21:18.595 --> 21:19.729
No, no, no.

21:19.730 --> 21:20.731
Wait, wait, wait.
Listen, lady.

21:20.731 --> 21:22.733
What do you want?

21:22.733 --> 21:25.235
I could really use
a ride right now.

21:25.235 --> 21:27.687
That guy would kill me.

21:27.688 --> 21:29.656
Where are you headed?

21:29.656 --> 21:32.742
Las Vegas.

21:32.743 --> 21:36.196
Well, I ain't.

21:48.208 --> 21:50.210
If you think I'm
giving any handouts,

21:50.210 --> 21:51.711
you've got
another thing coming.

21:51.712 --> 21:53.714
Come on,
get in the car.

21:53.714 --> 21:55.348
No, no, no, no, no.
Yeah, yeah, no handouts.

21:55.349 --> 21:57.351
I got plenty of money.

21:57.351 --> 22:00.354
No, no, no. That's the
last thing I worry about.

22:03.223 --> 22:04.224
Look, kid, you can't
just go around

22:04.224 --> 22:06.609
telling people
stuff like that.

22:06.610 --> 22:07.611
Like what?

22:07.611 --> 22:10.113
Like about money,
and having plenty of it.

22:10.113 --> 22:11.481
That just marks
you right there.

22:11.481 --> 22:13.483
You hear me?

22:13.483 --> 22:15.485
Yeah.

22:15.485 --> 22:17.370
Good, I'm not looking
for an amateur.

22:21.825 --> 22:24.327
What's your name, kid?

22:24.328 --> 22:25.329
Luli.

22:25.329 --> 22:28.298
Luli?

22:28.298 --> 22:30.216
Oh, what kind
of a name is that?

22:31.718 --> 22:33.836
Poor thing.

22:33.837 --> 22:35.839
Well, I'll tell you what
kind of a name it is.

22:35.839 --> 22:37.841
It's a strange name.

22:37.841 --> 22:40.059
And I'd be willing to bet
you're a strange kid, huh?

22:40.060 --> 22:43.897
Well, what's your name?

22:43.897 --> 22:47.233
Glenda.

22:47.234 --> 22:48.735
That's a name, huh?

22:48.735 --> 22:50.737
I know it's
real pretty.

22:50.737 --> 22:53.239
I always liked it.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.775
Where are you
from anyway?

22:55.776 --> 22:58.779
Um...

23:01.281 --> 23:01.781
(French accent):
Um, Paris.

23:01.782 --> 23:03.283
Um, what?

23:03.283 --> 23:04.834
(Normal voice):
Paris.

23:10.340 --> 23:13.509
You are such
a funny little thing.

23:13.510 --> 23:17.013
Oh, man.

23:17.013 --> 23:21.434
Okay, tell me about
this old junior you ditched.

23:22.469 --> 23:23.470
What did he look like?

23:23.470 --> 23:25.638
Was he easy on
the eyes at least?

23:25.639 --> 23:29.643
Like a real
gunslinger type.

23:29.643 --> 23:31.561
Even had a limp.

23:41.321 --> 23:45.792
Listen, kid, I don't have
time to draw you a map,

23:45.792 --> 23:48.294
but there's a reason
mamas tell their babies

23:48.295 --> 23:49.713
to stay away from
guys like that.

23:52.916 --> 23:55.418
Like, you don't know
the first thing.

23:55.419 --> 23:56.420
How old are you?

23:56.420 --> 24:00.924
Thirteen.

24:10.817 --> 24:11.901
Go on.

24:11.902 --> 24:15.405
Go on. You wanna
try it, don't you?

24:17.441 --> 24:19.943
Figure sooner or later, you're
gonna be doing this anyways,

24:19.943 --> 24:23.830
but it's gonna be
with some skinny fuck

24:23.830 --> 24:27.083
giving it to you,
calling it love.

24:29.085 --> 24:32.588
So this way you know.

24:58.698 --> 24:59.815
<i>So what's your
daddy look like?</i>

24:59.816 --> 25:03.619
<i>Maybe I've seen him.</i>

25:20.720 --> 25:22.722
Amen.

25:37.354 --> 25:38.855
Come on. Get your
tail over here.

25:38.855 --> 25:40.857
What? What?

25:40.857 --> 25:42.859
Are you a wily kid?

25:42.859 --> 25:44.861
Am I what?

25:44.861 --> 25:46.662
Wily, do I need
to buy you a dictionary?

25:46.663 --> 25:48.665
Street smart!

25:48.665 --> 25:51.668
Um, yeah, sure.

25:51.668 --> 25:54.704
I guess so, yeah.

25:54.704 --> 25:58.290
Oh, can you fucking block
the wind for me please?

25:58.291 --> 26:00.793
Oh, thank you.

26:00.794 --> 26:02.962
Glenda, do you
go to church?

26:02.963 --> 26:07.467
Church is for
brunettes.

26:07.467 --> 26:10.970
Okay, here's what
I want you to do.

26:39.249 --> 26:41.251
Um...

26:44.254 --> 26:44.754
you got any
Hubba Bubba, mister?

26:46.756 --> 26:49.842
Sure thing, pumpkin,
right over here.

26:55.815 --> 26:56.816
There you go, sweetie.

27:10.080 --> 27:13.333
Glenda!
Glenda!

27:13.333 --> 27:16.035
It's not exactly what
I had in mind, kid.

27:16.036 --> 27:19.539
Get him off me! Get him off me!
Get him off me! Oh!

27:23.627 --> 27:26.513
Oh, shit.

27:26.513 --> 27:27.514
Shit!
Is he dead?

27:27.514 --> 27:28.431
Fuck, I don't know.

27:28.431 --> 27:32.885
Where were you going with
that stupid plan, anyway?

27:32.886 --> 27:34.888
I saw it in a movie.

27:34.888 --> 27:36.389
Come on.

27:36.389 --> 27:38.557
Maybe we should call
someone or something.

27:38.558 --> 27:39.559
Shut up.

27:39.559 --> 27:41.060
But, Glenda, we can't
just leave him there.

27:41.061 --> 27:42.062
Oh, you better
believe we can.

27:42.062 --> 27:43.730
No, we can't.
Amateur.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.064
Listen to me!

27:45.065 --> 27:46.616
What looks weirder?

27:46.616 --> 27:49.535
Two girls call an ambulance
for some old dead guy

27:49.536 --> 27:51.037
and maybe down the road

27:51.037 --> 27:52.738
they figure out some
money's missing?

27:52.739 --> 27:57.243
Or there's some dead guy
lying on the floor,

27:57.243 --> 28:01.130
no one's inside and all
the fucking money is gone?

28:02.999 --> 28:06.002
Oh, never mind.

28:06.002 --> 28:07.503
Glenda, listen to me!

28:07.504 --> 28:10.640
What do you care?

28:10.640 --> 28:14.894
Well, I gotta live
with myself.

28:14.894 --> 28:18.847
I'm so worried my baby will be traumatized for life.

28:18.848 --> 28:20.850
We got the best ER in the state.

28:20.850 --> 28:23.853
That's good because we loved
that old man so much.

28:23.853 --> 28:25.855
Let's go.

28:25.855 --> 28:29.358
Bye, thank you.

28:32.996 --> 28:36.165
I mean, is that
my fault, you know?

28:36.166 --> 28:37.667
He probably just got

28:37.667 --> 28:40.670
like a temporary stroke
or something, right?

28:40.670 --> 28:42.171
He's gonna be fine in like an
hour or so, something like that.

28:42.172 --> 28:44.123
He'll be fine.

28:44.124 --> 28:46.092
Oh, come on.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.094
You heard the man.

28:48.094 --> 28:51.097
Kimball has got the
best ER in the state.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.348
Hell, I even
heard of it.

28:52.348 --> 28:56.185
I think that that may
be the most famous

28:56.186 --> 28:59.689
medical establishment
in the world.

28:59.689 --> 29:03.476
There, I said it.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.197
You wanna pray?

29:08.198 --> 29:10.650
Are you fucking
kidding me?

29:10.650 --> 29:13.486
Hey, watch your
language, kid.

29:13.486 --> 29:15.488
Come on, give
me your hand.

29:15.488 --> 29:20.493
I can't leave my eyes closed
too long while I'm driving.

29:20.493 --> 29:23.579
Dear God, don't let
that old man die yet.

29:23.580 --> 29:27.584
Best wishes, Glenda.

29:27.584 --> 29:29.886
Amen.

29:32.672 --> 29:36.092
Glenda, you got any
more of that stuff?

29:36.092 --> 29:40.980
No kid, fresh out.

29:57.664 --> 30:01.668
All right, I'm gonna let
you in on a little secret.

30:02.669 --> 30:04.871
Are you listening?

30:04.871 --> 30:06.372
Yeah.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.374
There's a little
trick you can do

30:08.374 --> 30:09.875
when you start doing what
you're doing right now,

30:09.876 --> 30:12.461
which is dwelling.

30:12.462 --> 30:14.514
I see it.

30:14.514 --> 30:17.016
You're dwelling,
sweetheart.

30:17.016 --> 30:20.386
You're playing the same song
over and over again on repeat.

30:20.386 --> 30:23.889
Am I right?

30:23.890 --> 30:25.892
Yeah.

30:25.892 --> 30:28.394
Okay, now what
I want you to do

30:28.394 --> 30:31.897
is I want you put a quarter
in that there jukebox

30:31.898 --> 30:33.900
and change the record.

30:33.900 --> 30:34.901
You just change
that record.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.203
Do a different song.

30:37.203 --> 30:38.988
See?

30:38.988 --> 30:42.825
And play something
bright, please.

30:44.878 --> 30:46.880
We're here to celebrate.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.381
Go on.

30:48.381 --> 30:50.883
Put your face on.

30:50.884 --> 30:52.886
You like whiskey?

30:52.886 --> 30:56.890
No.

30:56.890 --> 30:58.892
What are you,
some kind of communist?

30:58.892 --> 31:03.096
Speaking of which,
now that you got some money,

31:03.096 --> 31:04.097
you're gonna have
people on your ass

31:04.097 --> 31:07.567
hounding you,
trying to get it out of you.

31:07.567 --> 31:09.569
A fool and his money
is easy to part

31:09.569 --> 31:10.570
so you gotta learn how to--

31:10.570 --> 31:11.354
Am I boring you?

31:13.106 --> 31:14.107
No.

31:18.361 --> 31:19.862
Go on.

31:19.863 --> 31:20.363
You should be writing
this shit down.

31:20.363 --> 31:21.864
I'm giving you gold.

31:21.865 --> 31:25.618
I'm like fucking
Gandhi over here.

31:30.206 --> 31:32.124
Better fix that B

31:32.125 --> 31:33.626
before people start
calling you Lane's Lanes.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.628
They already do.
Hi, sweetheart.

31:35.628 --> 31:38.130
This here's Luli.

31:38.131 --> 31:39.098
Name is Blane.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.683
Pleased to meet you.

31:41.684 --> 31:44.186
You just gonna stay in here all
day and shake hands,

31:44.187 --> 31:47.306
make small talk or are
you gonna make us a drink?

31:47.307 --> 31:50.143
Thank you.

31:50.143 --> 31:52.145
Hey, Angel.

31:52.145 --> 31:55.648
Oh, little spud, I can't even
get a smile out of you?

31:55.648 --> 31:59.151
I got a present
for you.

31:59.152 --> 32:01.454
Luli, go to the car
and get that you-know-what.

32:06.409 --> 32:09.412
Cover your eyes.

32:11.915 --> 32:13.416
You're just a saint.
Do you like that drink?

32:13.416 --> 32:14.800
I'm drinking it,
ain't I?

32:25.395 --> 32:28.097
Well, well, look.

32:28.097 --> 32:29.932
That sure
is graceful.

32:36.272 --> 32:38.274
You stalking me?

32:38.274 --> 32:39.275
No, come on.

32:39.275 --> 32:41.277
Two folks heading west
are bound to cross paths.

32:41.277 --> 32:42.745
You don't like it,
you get off I-80.

32:47.450 --> 32:48.918
You know, maybe you ought
to mind the company you keep.

32:51.871 --> 32:54.123
Yeah, well, maybe you ought to
mind your own business, cowboy.

33:01.431 --> 33:03.433
You know what I think?

33:03.433 --> 33:07.687
I think me and you, we might
have got off on the wrong foot.

33:15.361 --> 33:16.862
Nighty night.

33:16.863 --> 33:20.366
Don't you let
the bed bugs bite.

33:31.995 --> 33:32.996
Get out of the way!

33:32.996 --> 33:36.883
What's wrong with you?

33:42.388 --> 33:43.889
Come on, Angel.

33:43.890 --> 33:45.892
Come on.

34:02.909 --> 34:04.911
Angel...

34:09.415 --> 34:12.418
it's gonna be okay.

34:17.672 --> 34:20.175
Okay, look, why bring that bunny
all the way from Memphis

34:20.176 --> 34:21.177
and take off like
the place has herpes?

34:21.177 --> 34:23.179
Traffic.

34:23.179 --> 34:24.179
Tell me the truth kid.

34:24.179 --> 34:27.183
Am I gonna see you on the back
of one of them milk cartons?

34:27.183 --> 34:28.601
No.

34:28.601 --> 34:31.103
Because I'm not looking
for no kind of trouble.

34:31.103 --> 34:34.223
Not like I kidnapped you
against your will,

34:34.223 --> 34:36.358
making you do some
fucking childhood slavery

34:36.359 --> 34:37.643
or some Geraldo shit.

34:37.643 --> 34:40.646
Why would I lie to you?

34:40.646 --> 34:42.481
I helped you rob a
convenience store, Glenda.

34:45.868 --> 34:48.370
All right.

34:48.371 --> 34:50.072
All right.

34:53.126 --> 34:56.129
See this place?
Look at it.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.431
<i>Maybe God and all the angels took note</i>

35:16.432 --> 35:18.484
<i>of that blue dress too.</i>

35:18.484 --> 35:21.570
<i>Because when that baby came out
the color of moonlight,</i>

35:21.571 --> 35:25.074
<i>we all knew
something was wrong.</i>

35:25.074 --> 35:26.575
<i>And he was a boy,
all right.</i>

35:26.576 --> 35:28.527
<i>But he wasn't
the kind of boy</i>

35:28.528 --> 35:30.997
<i>you could take out front</i>

35:30.997 --> 35:33.499
<i>and play ball
with, no, sir.</i>

35:33.499 --> 35:36.535
<i>He was just
poor in the colour,</i>

35:36.536 --> 35:39.705
<i>coming off the moon.</i>

35:39.705 --> 35:43.041
<i>You see, it's one thing
to pretend you're James Dean</i>

35:43.042 --> 35:45.594
<i>and tip your hat before riding
off into the setting sun,</i>

35:45.595 --> 35:47.597
<i>but not being able to scrape two
dimes together</i>

35:47.597 --> 35:51.183
<i>makes it so your baby boy</i>

35:51.184 --> 35:53.186
<i>born the colour
of moonlight</i>

35:53.186 --> 35:57.139
<i>he has to stay in
that 10-cup incubator.</i>

35:57.140 --> 35:59.142
<i>Then there's nothing
so glamorous</i>

35:59.142 --> 36:01.144
<i>about that, now,
is there?</i>

36:16.159 --> 36:21.164
Rise and shine,
sugar tits.

36:21.164 --> 36:23.666
Okay.

36:23.666 --> 36:25.668
Don't fuck
this up, kid.

36:25.668 --> 36:29.171
Hey, I mean, it.

36:29.172 --> 36:32.675
What the hell, Glenda?

36:32.675 --> 36:34.176
Hey, there, moonbeam.

36:34.177 --> 36:36.179
Hey, baby doll.

36:36.179 --> 36:38.181
What do we have here?

36:38.181 --> 36:39.182
This here is Luli.

36:39.182 --> 36:40.683
Luli.

36:40.683 --> 36:42.685
You sure got a
nice house, mister.

36:42.685 --> 36:43.185
Oh, mister, hell.

36:43.186 --> 36:44.687
Call me Lloyd.

36:44.687 --> 36:46.689
That's my name.

36:46.689 --> 36:49.191
Don't need to stand on ceremony
so you all come on in here.

36:49.192 --> 36:51.194
Fix that rat's nest.

36:51.194 --> 36:53.829
Ha-ha!

36:53.829 --> 36:54.830
Well, go on in.

36:54.830 --> 36:57.833
Come on.

36:57.833 --> 37:00.285
Whoa, you're a day
late sugar britches.

37:00.286 --> 37:04.290
Oh, baby cakes,
you know who that damn car is.

37:05.508 --> 37:08.010
You know, I just about had
it with that damn car.

37:08.010 --> 37:11.013
I'm serious
as a heart attack.

37:11.013 --> 37:12.180
I'm-- Oh, don't look!
Don't look!

37:12.181 --> 37:13.182
Turn around!
Turn around!

37:13.182 --> 37:14.683
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, baby.

37:14.684 --> 37:15.685
I finally finished it.

37:15.685 --> 37:18.437
You are going
to shit a brick.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.939
Mr. Lloyd, mind if I talk
to Glenda for a minute?

37:20.940 --> 37:23.442
Oh, sure, baby,
go ahead.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.943
Just us two girls.

37:24.944 --> 37:29.448
Oh, lady talk.
I understand.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.316
I'll make you
a Shirley Temple.

37:31.317 --> 37:32.318
Glenda, he's here.

37:32.318 --> 37:33.535
Who's here?

37:33.536 --> 37:38.040
It's him, the gimp.

37:38.040 --> 37:40.125
Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

37:43.629 --> 37:48.133
He's definitely following
me, don't you think?

37:48.134 --> 37:50.002
No, he ain't, kid.
He's following me.

37:50.002 --> 37:52.504
What?

37:52.505 --> 37:55.007
Has been my whole life
(Unclear).

37:55.007 --> 37:56.808
Drinks, ladies.

37:56.809 --> 37:59.261
What, he's like your
ex-boyfriend or something?

37:59.262 --> 38:00.229
Come on.

38:00.229 --> 38:03.232
Who gets what?

38:03.232 --> 38:05.234
Oh, you get the
Shirley Temple.

38:05.234 --> 38:09.521
All right, now a toast
to my pride and joy.

38:09.522 --> 38:13.526
I call it Lloyd's Lagoon.

38:13.526 --> 38:14.527
What do you think, honey?

38:14.527 --> 38:17.446
Oh, I think you sure
did it, honey buns.

38:17.446 --> 38:18.947
You know what?

38:18.948 --> 38:21.951
It's the little things
like this that make me giddy.

38:21.951 --> 38:26.455
Oh, ain't that
the truth?

38:26.455 --> 38:28.457
Oh, shit,
I almost forgot.

38:28.457 --> 38:29.458
This here is Eddie.

38:29.458 --> 38:30.592
He's the best.

38:30.593 --> 38:33.462
Works like a Mexican
but speaks American.

38:33.462 --> 38:35.464
Nice to meet you, Eddie.

38:35.464 --> 38:38.216
It sure is nice
to meet you too.

38:38.217 --> 38:42.604
I've heard such wonderful things
about you from your husband.

38:42.605 --> 38:46.859
Whoa, whoa, now, let's not give
the little lady a big ego.

38:46.859 --> 38:48.861
Not that that's
possible.

38:48.861 --> 38:49.695
Oh, stop.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.197
Besides, Eddie,

38:52.198 --> 38:55.451
I'm thinking about bumping
you up to my #1 man.

38:55.451 --> 38:56.452
How about that?

38:56.452 --> 38:57.953
What about Luis?

38:57.953 --> 39:02.457
Oh, shit,
no tengo green card.

39:02.458 --> 39:04.460
Luli, put your
drink down.

39:04.460 --> 39:05.461
Let's dance
to this song.

39:05.461 --> 39:06.962
Come on.
Come on.

39:21.727 --> 39:23.178
That's pretty good.

39:23.179 --> 39:25.681
Hey, how about
I have this dance now?

39:30.102 --> 39:31.603
Never knew you like
dancing so much.

39:31.604 --> 39:33.188
Ah!

39:33.189 --> 39:37.109
Seriously, Lu,
be honest.

39:37.109 --> 39:38.610
What do you think
of that bar?

39:38.611 --> 39:41.697
Just know-- Know that
I went to every garage sale

39:41.697 --> 39:42.698
between here and Elko

39:42.698 --> 39:44.199
looking for these
car tags.

39:45.251 --> 39:47.253
You sure are cute.

39:47.253 --> 39:49.755
Come on, baby.
Let's go outside.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.757
You sure are cute too.

39:53.259 --> 39:55.261
Come on, let's go.

40:02.635 --> 40:03.636
What the fuck?

40:03.636 --> 40:05.387
What the fuck is that?

40:07.189 --> 40:11.193
Eddie, I'm gonna
ask you a question.

40:11.193 --> 40:14.696
What the fuck

40:14.697 --> 40:15.564
is that?

40:18.067 --> 40:20.786
That's a bottle
of soda.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.788
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding!

40:22.788 --> 40:23.789
That's right.

40:23.789 --> 40:24.790
That's right, genius.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.575
It is a bottle
of soda.

40:26.575 --> 40:28.577
But what kind?

40:28.577 --> 40:32.747
What kind of soda
is it, Einstein?

40:32.748 --> 40:35.133
Squirt.

40:35.134 --> 40:36.635
What?
What was that?

40:36.635 --> 40:38.720
It's Squirt.
It's a bottle of squirt.

40:38.721 --> 40:40.222
Right you are.

40:40.222 --> 40:42.724
That is a bottle
of Squirt.

40:42.725 --> 40:47.346
But have you ever heard of
a drink called 7 and Squirt?

40:47.346 --> 40:49.348
Have you?

40:49.348 --> 40:52.184
I mean, have you ever
in your whole life

40:52.184 --> 40:54.769
heard somebody saddle up to a
bar like this

40:54.770 --> 40:57.656
and say, "Hey, mister.

40:57.656 --> 41:01.526
Can I have a 7
and Squirt?"

41:01.527 --> 41:03.362
No.

41:05.364 --> 41:06.748
No, what?

41:06.749 --> 41:10.119
No.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.620
No, sir.

41:11.620 --> 41:16.091
Goddamn it!

41:16.091 --> 41:19.961
What the fuck is
going on in here?

41:22.298 --> 41:25.301
I think it best you to
apologize to the wife here

41:25.301 --> 41:27.803
for trying to skimp
on the 7-Up.

41:27.803 --> 41:30.522
Baby, it don't matter.

41:30.523 --> 41:32.892
It does to me.

41:32.892 --> 41:34.143
I'm teaching
a lesson here.

41:34.143 --> 41:35.944
Now get your ass up to
the front of the bar.

41:35.945 --> 41:39.448
Look this lady
right in the eye.

41:41.450 --> 41:44.453
Now repeat after me.

41:44.453 --> 41:47.706
Glenda, I am so sorry.

41:47.706 --> 41:51.076
When I am asked to stock
the bar, I will never,

41:51.076 --> 41:55.080
ever skimp on
the 7-Up again.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.582
Scout's honour.

41:57.583 --> 42:01.086
Glenda, I am so sorry.

42:01.086 --> 42:05.590
I promise I will never,
ever skimp on the 7-Up again.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.929
Scout's honour.

42:16.819 --> 42:19.571
It was good.

42:19.572 --> 42:21.941
Great, perfect even.

42:21.941 --> 42:26.662
Now why don't
you just gimp

42:26.662 --> 42:27.663
your way on over there
to the kitchen

42:27.663 --> 42:30.032
and get us some
7-Up there, cowboy.

42:36.839 --> 42:38.841
All right, that was
out of control.

42:41.343 --> 42:43.545
But that poor
bastard's so dumb,

42:43.546 --> 42:46.549
he couldn't pour
whiskey out of a boot

42:46.549 --> 42:50.553
with directions
on the heel.

42:50.553 --> 42:53.556
You see, Luli,
you gotta train them.

42:53.556 --> 42:54.557
You really do.

42:54.557 --> 42:55.558
Am I right, Glenda?

42:55.558 --> 42:58.561
Yes, sir.

42:58.561 --> 43:00.062
You gotta break them.

43:19.665 --> 43:20.666
Just like old wild buck.

43:20.666 --> 43:23.135
Just gotta teach him
a lesson or two,

43:23.135 --> 43:25.053
and he'll be fine.

43:25.054 --> 43:27.756
Fucking drink's warm.

43:29.758 --> 43:31.760
Some ice.

43:35.648 --> 43:36.649
Then you stir it.

44:00.873 --> 44:02.875
Ooh.

44:02.875 --> 44:03.876
Hah.

44:12.267 --> 44:14.185
That's a fucking
drink!

44:14.186 --> 44:16.638
Oh!

44:20.809 --> 44:24.813
Now that,
that's a drink.

44:26.198 --> 44:27.699
That's a drink.

44:27.700 --> 44:29.034
Come on.

44:29.034 --> 44:32.987
Luli, I want to
show you something

44:32.988 --> 44:35.457
that will knock your
socks off, little girl.

44:36.959 --> 44:41.997
Paradise, Garden of Eden.

44:41.997 --> 44:43.498
I designed them.
I'm building them.

44:43.499 --> 44:46.134
All the pool, bar,
water features.

44:46.135 --> 44:49.138
Can I use your
phone for a second?

44:49.138 --> 44:51.140
Sure thing, honeybee.

44:51.140 --> 44:54.143
In the kitchen.

44:58.147 --> 45:00.732
No long distance, honey.

45:02.735 --> 45:04.737
Now what's your acquaintance
with my friend in there?

45:04.737 --> 45:07.239
Which one?

45:07.239 --> 45:08.990
You know which one.

45:08.991 --> 45:10.909
You want the truth?

45:10.909 --> 45:13.695
No, please lie
to me, Eddie.

45:16.165 --> 45:19.168
Eddie, you know, maybe
what I said to you

45:19.168 --> 45:20.669
in the truck
wasn't so nice.

45:20.669 --> 45:23.955
Come on, that's water
under the bridge now.

45:23.956 --> 45:24.957
It's water under
the bridge.

45:24.957 --> 45:28.460
Now I got to head into town and
run some errands and, Glenda,

45:28.460 --> 45:30.345
she wants you
to go with me.

45:30.345 --> 45:34.298
So they
can-- Luli, I don't want--

45:34.299 --> 45:38.019
They can--
You know, sexy time.

45:40.522 --> 45:42.023
Come on.

45:42.024 --> 45:43.108
I'm willing to bet
you you've never seen

45:43.108 --> 45:46.611
anything like
the town of Wyatt.

45:46.612 --> 45:48.647
You know they got the world's
largest ball of barbed wire?

45:48.647 --> 45:50.649
It's true.

45:50.649 --> 45:54.653
It's fucking huge.

45:54.653 --> 45:57.872
Sometimes they even
got famous people.

45:57.873 --> 45:59.574
That's what they tell me.

46:02.327 --> 46:04.662
Come on, Luli.

46:04.663 --> 46:07.999
Maybe if I leave a note.

46:22.397 --> 46:23.398
Well, you stay put.

46:23.398 --> 46:27.402
Wait, you stay here.

46:27.402 --> 46:28.903
I won't be long.
You wait here.

46:41.450 --> 46:43.335
I warned you, boy.

46:50.626 --> 46:52.628
Ooh.

46:54.763 --> 46:56.264
You're up.

47:21.957 --> 47:23.825
Here it goes.

47:29.331 --> 47:30.382
Buy you a drink?

47:30.382 --> 47:31.883
I'll tell you what though,

47:31.884 --> 47:34.836
the ball and chain's
not going to be happy.

47:34.837 --> 47:37.840
Say double the stakes?

47:37.840 --> 47:40.142
You think I just fell
off the couch?

47:40.142 --> 47:44.646
No, I ain't hustling.
I'm just rusty.

47:44.646 --> 47:48.650
Come on, a gentleman ought to
give me the chance to recoup.

47:51.153 --> 47:53.572
All right.

48:04.783 --> 48:06.785
I knew it. Fucking--

48:06.785 --> 48:11.289
Just shaking off
the rust.

48:16.295 --> 48:18.463
Hey, you lost or something,
little girl?

48:18.463 --> 48:21.766
I thought I told you
to wait in the truck.

48:21.767 --> 48:22.768
Hey, mister,
she can't be in here.

48:22.768 --> 48:25.270
How about we go back
to Lloyd's, huh?

48:25.270 --> 48:27.221
Who, Lloyd Nash?

48:27.222 --> 48:29.140
Yeah, that's right.

48:29.141 --> 48:31.143
Lloyd Nash.

48:31.143 --> 48:34.146
You two friends with him?

48:34.146 --> 48:37.149
Yeah, yeah,
you know, Eddie here,

48:37.149 --> 48:40.285
he's Lloyd's
right-hand man.

48:40.285 --> 48:43.288
That so?

48:43.288 --> 48:45.290
Sure.

48:45.290 --> 48:48.793
Hey, any friend of Lloyd's
is a friend of mine.

48:48.794 --> 48:51.296
Thank you.

49:09.765 --> 49:12.350
Hah, what
do you know?

49:12.351 --> 49:14.853
Girl's my little
pot of gold.

49:23.912 --> 49:26.030
Hot damn!

49:29.084 --> 49:30.585
Shuffle on over here
and pay piper 200 smackers.

49:45.183 --> 49:48.186
As a gentlemen, I gave
you a chance to recoup,

49:48.186 --> 49:49.187
but I ain't convinced
you got the pockets

49:49.187 --> 49:53.307
to pay what you
owe, cowboy.

49:53.308 --> 49:55.310
You like Stetsons?

49:55.310 --> 49:57.312
No, no.

50:24.006 --> 50:25.307
Get the fuck off me.
Get off me.

50:25.307 --> 50:29.144
Get off of me!

50:31.013 --> 50:34.016
Stop it! No!

50:34.016 --> 50:36.018
Get the fuck off me!

50:37.602 --> 50:40.438
Eddie, you motherfucker!

50:43.325 --> 50:45.777
Did you whistle?

50:45.777 --> 50:46.778
You whistle
while you work?

50:46.778 --> 50:48.279
You whistle
while you work.

50:48.280 --> 50:52.284
Then what the fuck are you,
the fucking pied piper?

50:55.287 --> 50:56.288
Get off me!

50:58.256 --> 51:02.093
Watch it!
Watch it!

51:18.393 --> 51:20.645
Eddie!

51:34.993 --> 51:37.578
Plea-- Please.

52:09.444 --> 52:11.412
Gotta mention the fact that you fucked up my money shot

52:11.413 --> 52:12.914
with your grand
fucking entrance.

52:12.914 --> 52:13.781
That whole thing
was your fault.

52:13.782 --> 52:15.283
That don't give
you the right

52:15.283 --> 52:16.784
to sell me off like
some two-bit hooker.

52:16.785 --> 52:18.286
You think I
sold you off?

52:18.286 --> 52:20.538
"Welcher"!
You remember that?

52:20.539 --> 52:23.258
You were telling him you saw him
walk into that ladies' room

52:23.258 --> 52:26.261
after me, and you waited
all that time for what?

52:26.261 --> 52:28.263
Shut up!
What?

52:28.263 --> 52:30.265
Just for fun?

52:30.265 --> 52:31.266
Maybe I didn't
see him go in.

52:31.266 --> 52:33.768
I did not see
him go in.

52:33.768 --> 52:34.268
Did you ever
think of that?

52:34.269 --> 52:36.521
Bullshit.

52:42.027 --> 52:45.030
"Didn't see him."

52:45.030 --> 52:47.532
I mean, you must have me
confused with some Okie

52:47.532 --> 52:49.817
if you think I'm going
to buy that song and dance.

52:49.818 --> 52:52.287
A lot of nice people
from Oklahoma, Lu.

52:52.287 --> 52:53.788
What?

52:53.788 --> 52:56.290
I said there a lot of nice
people from Oklahoma

52:56.291 --> 52:57.792
who probably
wouldn't like it

52:57.792 --> 52:59.293
if they
heard you say

52:59.294 --> 53:00.461
what you just said
about being an Okie.

53:00.462 --> 53:02.964
Eddie, you just threw
me in a bathroom

53:02.964 --> 53:04.465
with some
gap-toothed retard,

53:04.466 --> 53:06.301
and you're trying to talk
to me about manners?

53:06.301 --> 53:08.303
Listen to me,
retard-- Retard--

53:08.303 --> 53:11.556
Retard is also not a very nice
thing to call someone.

53:11.556 --> 53:14.392
You're crazy.

53:14.392 --> 53:15.393
You're fucking crazy.

53:15.393 --> 53:18.562
You're a psychopath.

53:18.563 --> 53:20.064
Look, did you ever stop
to think that maybe

53:20.065 --> 53:21.349
you don't know everything?

53:21.349 --> 53:23.351
Now, did you ever
stop to think

53:23.351 --> 53:24.852
that maybe someone
twice your age

53:24.853 --> 53:26.855
might maybe know
a little bit more

53:26.855 --> 53:29.023
about getting out
of a tight spot, huh? Do you?

53:29.024 --> 53:32.527
Yeah, well, I know enough
to know that Okie retard

53:32.527 --> 53:35.530
had ample enough time in that
bathroom with little old me

53:35.530 --> 53:38.449
before your
ass showed up.

53:38.450 --> 53:40.869
You disappoint me, Luli.

53:40.869 --> 53:43.371
I disappoint you?

53:43.371 --> 53:46.257
I disapp--
Why do I disappoint you?

53:46.258 --> 53:49.261
Because if I sold you
off to pay some debt,

53:49.261 --> 53:52.297
why would I bother
to save you?

53:56.134 --> 53:59.020
Next time you stick
in the fucking truck.

54:18.823 --> 54:21.325
Do you want
some ice cream?

54:21.326 --> 54:23.828
Oh, so I'm supposed to melt in
your hand for some ice cream?

54:23.828 --> 54:25.830
All right, okay,
here we go.

54:25.830 --> 54:27.498
Look, I don't want
any ice cream.

54:27.499 --> 54:28.500
I don't like it.

54:28.500 --> 54:30.502
Come on, Luli.

54:30.502 --> 54:32.504
Come on, everybody
likes ice cream.

54:32.504 --> 54:34.422
No, they don't.

54:34.422 --> 54:37.341
I don't.

54:37.342 --> 54:40.228
Ergo, not everybody
likes ice cream.

54:40.228 --> 54:43.481
Ergo?

54:43.481 --> 54:47.268
Yeah, as in,
therefore, hence.

54:49.771 --> 54:51.773
Well, you must be smart.

54:51.773 --> 54:55.193
Smart and pretty, that right
there is a deadly combination.

54:57.612 --> 55:01.616
You-- You think
I'm pretty?

55:01.616 --> 55:03.618
Do I think you're what?

55:03.618 --> 55:07.338
Prett--
You heard me.

55:09.841 --> 55:11.509
I guess.

55:11.509 --> 55:15.045
Well, do you
or don't you?

55:15.046 --> 55:16.547
I think if it weren't for
that horrible mouth of yours,

55:16.548 --> 55:18.550
then some people,
not me of course,

55:18.550 --> 55:20.552
but I think some
people might find you

55:20.552 --> 55:22.470
somewhat kind
of attractive.

55:25.640 --> 55:29.143
In a furry little
animal sort of way.

55:34.816 --> 55:37.318
Well, do you want some
ice cream or what?

55:37.319 --> 55:38.320
No.
No, you don't.

55:38.320 --> 55:41.039
Neither do I.
Let's get out of here.

55:55.754 --> 55:57.922
Be two seconds.

55:57.922 --> 55:59.423
Look, maybe we
should head back.

55:59.424 --> 56:00.808
I don't--
This will be real quick.

56:00.809 --> 56:04.179
You coming?

56:04.179 --> 56:06.181
No.

56:06.181 --> 56:08.566
Come on, I got some
friends I want you to meet.

56:08.566 --> 56:10.901
What do you care?

56:10.902 --> 56:13.404
See, that's--
That's just great.

56:13.405 --> 56:15.907
So I tell you to wait in
the truck; you come inside.

56:15.907 --> 56:19.410
And I tell you to come inside;
you wait in the truck.

56:19.411 --> 56:20.412
Well, you know,
I might as well--

56:20.412 --> 56:22.414
I should just tell
you the opposite.

56:22.414 --> 56:25.417
So please, all right,
pretty please, please,

56:25.417 --> 56:26.418
please,
wait in the truck.

56:26.418 --> 56:28.369
I'm begging you!

56:32.841 --> 56:35.426
All right.

56:35.427 --> 56:37.262
Wait, you sure
you're not a mule?

56:39.681 --> 56:41.182
You sure?

56:43.435 --> 56:45.970
Hey, ladies.

57:06.408 --> 57:09.294
Well, hi there.

57:18.136 --> 57:21.139
Come on, now, I told
you I had errands.

57:21.139 --> 57:22.640
Keep driving.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.591
All right.

57:24.592 --> 57:27.094
I just thought you might want
to know that Glenda called.

57:27.095 --> 57:29.897
She's waiting for us at
Devil's Slide, Motel 6.

57:31.182 --> 57:34.185
Motel 6? Right.

57:34.185 --> 57:35.686
Some kind of
scrape with Lloyd.

57:35.687 --> 57:38.489
Said something
about she owed you.

57:42.410 --> 57:46.414
Besides, I got
you something.

57:48.867 --> 57:53.621
Come on, it's for you.

58:00.545 --> 58:03.047
Come on, Luli.

58:05.884 --> 58:08.686
You don't like it?

58:08.686 --> 58:11.605
It's pink.

58:14.609 --> 58:15.610
Ugh!

58:15.610 --> 58:19.397
Come on.
Come on!

58:23.485 --> 58:25.787
For future reference, pink
is my worst favourite colour.

58:25.787 --> 58:26.788
That don't make sense.

58:26.788 --> 58:28.289
Excuse me?

58:28.289 --> 58:31.742
"Worst favourite,"
don't make sense.

58:31.743 --> 58:33.661
Yeah, you know, if I hear
one more word out of you

58:33.661 --> 58:35.663
from here to the Motel 6,
I'm getting out.

58:35.663 --> 58:40.668
Understood?

58:40.668 --> 58:42.670
You know what?

58:42.670 --> 58:44.171
Hm?

58:44.172 --> 58:46.674
I think you like me.

58:46.674 --> 58:48.676
Okay.

58:48.676 --> 58:51.478
Hey, look at me.

58:51.479 --> 58:54.181
I think that you find
me worthy of note.

58:54.182 --> 58:58.519
Worthy of note?

58:58.520 --> 59:00.522
You find me exciting,
don't you?

59:00.522 --> 59:02.524
I excite you.

59:14.919 --> 59:16.420
You're a special one.

59:16.421 --> 59:18.423
You know that, Eddie?

59:18.423 --> 59:20.792
Special.

59:40.028 --> 59:44.032
That's all they had.
So don't complain.

59:44.032 --> 59:45.650
Come on in.

59:47.652 --> 59:48.736
Where's Glenda?

59:48.736 --> 59:50.237
She's here
somewhere.

59:58.746 --> 01:00:00.497
Why don't you try
on your new dress?

01:00:04.302 --> 01:00:07.638
Well, little lady,
I gave it to you.

01:00:10.642 --> 01:00:12.393
I bet you'd look
real pretty there.

01:00:14.679 --> 01:00:16.681
You could be
a movie star.

01:00:18.683 --> 01:00:20.685
Come on.

01:00:20.685 --> 01:00:22.153
Put it on.

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:29.861
Okay.

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:15.622
Hey, Eddie.

01:01:15.623 --> 01:01:19.293
Eddie, remember how you
said Glenda called?

01:01:19.293 --> 01:01:21.795
What?

01:01:23.798 --> 01:01:27.585
Eddie.

01:01:30.588 --> 01:01:34.174
Eddie, when did
Glenda call?

01:01:34.175 --> 01:01:38.679
Look at you.

01:01:39.681 --> 01:01:44.185
Eddie, when did
Glenda call?

01:01:44.185 --> 01:01:47.321
Look at you all
grown up there.

01:01:49.323 --> 01:01:50.607
Luli--

01:01:50.608 --> 01:01:54.612
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

01:01:54.612 --> 01:01:56.113
About me and Glenda.

01:01:56.114 --> 01:01:57.949
We had a talk.

01:01:57.949 --> 01:01:59.951
She said that she
couldn't keep you around

01:01:59.951 --> 01:02:01.585
because of Lloyd and all

01:02:01.586 --> 01:02:05.590
and that she wanted me
to take you off her hands.

01:02:07.091 --> 01:02:09.009
Sorry.

01:02:10.011 --> 01:02:13.014
No.

01:02:13.014 --> 01:02:14.882
No, you see,
Glenda wouldn't do that.

01:02:14.882 --> 01:02:17.384
Oh, yes, she would.

01:02:17.385 --> 01:02:20.304
Yes, she would
and she did.

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:24.808
She even gave me a grand
to watch out for you.

01:02:24.809 --> 01:02:26.811
And she said
that she felt bad

01:02:26.811 --> 01:02:29.814
but she wanted me
to take care of you.

01:02:29.814 --> 01:02:31.982
And make sure you stay
out of trouble.

01:02:31.983 --> 01:02:36.988
Now, I don't mean to burst
your bubble or anything,

01:02:36.988 --> 01:02:38.990
but she gave me
the money

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.490
and she said that
she'd be here,

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:40.491
and, well, she ain't.

01:02:40.491 --> 01:02:42.993
Glenda's a grifter,
darling.

01:02:42.994 --> 01:02:45.496
And once a grifter,
always a grifter.

01:02:54.005 --> 01:02:56.590
What?

01:03:01.763 --> 01:03:03.181
I need to get
some ice.

01:03:14.859 --> 01:03:17.695
You think that she
loves that rich prick?

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:32.793
Let me go.

01:03:32.794 --> 01:03:36.631
No, no, princess.

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:29.483
Careful. That thing
might swallow you up.

01:04:30.985 --> 01:04:31.902
What's your name?

01:04:31.903 --> 01:04:35.323
My-- My name's Luli.

01:04:35.323 --> 01:04:39.327
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
you going to ask my name?

01:04:40.745 --> 01:04:42.246
Okay, well,
I'll tell you anyway.

01:04:42.246 --> 01:04:43.697
My name is Clement.

01:04:45.867 --> 01:04:47.952
Yeah,
it's a family name.

01:04:47.952 --> 01:04:52.089
Yeah, well, listen.
It was nice meeting you.

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:53.290
Have you ever heard
of the category game?

01:04:53.291 --> 01:04:56.677
No.

01:04:56.677 --> 01:04:59.713
This game we like to play
with cards, just face cards.

01:04:59.714 --> 01:05:02.883
Why is it called
the category game?

01:05:02.884 --> 01:05:04.886
Because every time
you flip a jack,

01:05:04.886 --> 01:05:05.720
you have to think
of a category.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.272
What kind?

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:10.274
Could be anything, man.

01:05:10.274 --> 01:05:14.227
You know, like things you would
find in a hardware store

01:05:14.228 --> 01:05:16.230
or fake rock bands
in alphabetical order.

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:17.731
Then you keep going
around until someone

01:05:17.732 --> 01:05:18.949
gives up or
someone repeats.

01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:21.068
Then they have to drink.

01:05:21.068 --> 01:05:25.572
Yeah, listen,

01:05:25.573 --> 01:05:27.074
I gotta make a call,

01:05:27.074 --> 01:05:30.577
and you see, I don't
feel like going back

01:05:30.578 --> 01:05:31.579
to my room to get
a quarter.

01:05:31.579 --> 01:05:34.081
Okay.

01:05:34.081 --> 01:05:37.084
I'll tell you what.

01:05:37.084 --> 01:05:40.220
I will give you one shiny
quarter just for playing.

01:05:40.221 --> 01:05:43.224
I got quarters.

01:05:43.224 --> 01:05:46.227
I got crazy
quarters.

01:05:46.227 --> 01:05:47.228
Yeah?

01:05:47.228 --> 01:05:49.513
Yeah? Yeah?

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:53.016
Let's go.

01:05:53.017 --> 01:05:55.686
What?

01:05:55.686 --> 01:05:57.020
All right. All right.
Let's play.

01:05:59.273 --> 01:06:01.275
King, guy drinks.

01:06:01.275 --> 01:06:03.527
Queen, girl drinks.

01:06:03.527 --> 01:06:06.830
Queen, yeah, you drink.

01:06:09.283 --> 01:06:11.668
Jack, category.

01:06:11.669 --> 01:06:14.672
Category is what's
a good category?

01:06:14.672 --> 01:06:15.673
Cereal.

01:06:15.673 --> 01:06:17.174
That's a good category.

01:06:17.174 --> 01:06:18.175
What's your
favourite cereal?

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:19.176
Do I lose a turn?
Mm-hm.

01:06:19.176 --> 01:06:20.177
Cap'n Crunch.

01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:23.180
Nice.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.181
You start.

01:06:24.181 --> 01:06:25.465
You go ahead.
Okay.

01:06:25.466 --> 01:06:28.268
Movies?
Movies?

01:06:28.269 --> 01:06:29.770
<i>Have you seen
Deliverance?</i>

01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:33.273
Okay.

01:06:33.274 --> 01:06:35.276
Burt Reynolds,
you know, with the arrow.

01:06:35.276 --> 01:06:37.561
It's great.
Jon Voight has a purdy mouth.

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:39.563
Yeah, Burt Reynolds
was a little late

01:06:39.563 --> 01:06:43.567
in saving them because Ned
Beatty already found them.

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:48.321
Yeah. That's me again.

01:06:48.322 --> 01:06:50.824
(Laughing)
Mm.

01:06:50.825 --> 01:06:53.828
Ah!

01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:02.502
Category.

01:07:02.503 --> 01:07:05.506
What about girls whose
hearts you've broken?

01:07:05.506 --> 01:07:08.008
Oh, curveball.

01:07:08.009 --> 01:07:10.011
I'm going all night.
Number one?

01:07:10.011 --> 01:07:12.013
Number one? Hm, is there
something like cooler

01:07:12.013 --> 01:07:14.015
like Star Wars
characters or--

01:07:14.015 --> 01:07:16.017
Chewbacca!

01:07:16.017 --> 01:07:19.520
Ahem. Oh, I have to drink.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:23.023
Category, things you would
find in a hardware store.

01:07:26.027 --> 01:07:30.031
Anvil.

01:07:30.031 --> 01:07:32.750
Hey, it's time to go.

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:35.085
I'm really sorry, sir.
I'm Clement.

01:07:38.506 --> 01:07:40.124
Eddie, come on.

01:07:40.124 --> 01:07:43.794
Hi, Clement.
Eddie, come on.

01:07:43.794 --> 01:07:46.930
Oh, she don't like
you that much.

01:07:47.932 --> 01:07:50.100
Come on, Luli.

01:07:50.101 --> 01:07:52.103
Come on. What?

01:07:52.103 --> 01:07:54.105
What, Luli?

01:08:05.066 --> 01:08:08.069
The cheapest motherfuckers
in the world, rich people.

01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:11.572
You know, the rich get richer
and the poor get the picture.

01:08:11.572 --> 01:08:15.576
You get it straight.

01:08:15.576 --> 01:08:17.077
Now, that rich fuck,
he don't deserve you.

01:08:17.078 --> 01:08:20.214
He just wants one thing.

01:08:20.214 --> 01:08:21.715
But you know that, right?

01:08:21.715 --> 01:08:25.218
Who does deserve me?

01:08:25.219 --> 01:08:27.004
You?

01:08:28.005 --> 01:08:33.010
Maybe we deserve
each other, Luli.

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:35.011
Did you ever think that
maybe we're some kind

01:08:35.011 --> 01:08:38.515
of like star-crossed
souls destined--?

01:08:40.184 --> 01:08:43.687
Do you?

01:08:43.687 --> 01:08:45.689
Do you ever
think of that?

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:47.189
You and me?

01:08:47.191 --> 01:08:49.359
Are you serious?

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:53.363
Yeah, I'm serious.

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:54.865
No, I'm fucking--

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.421
Luli, what if
I was serious?

01:09:08.929 --> 01:09:11.932
I need you
to pull over.

01:09:11.932 --> 01:09:12.933
I need you to pull
over the car.

01:09:12.933 --> 01:09:14.434
So you can run on back
to your rich friend?

01:09:14.435 --> 01:09:18.055
Okay.

01:09:18.055 --> 01:09:22.059
Okay, I need you
to listen to me.

01:09:25.062 --> 01:09:30.067
If you ever think

01:09:30.067 --> 01:09:33.620
I'm ever going
to fall in love

01:09:33.621 --> 01:09:37.124
with a going-nowhere-fast...

01:09:39.126 --> 01:09:42.828
shit-faced
cripple like you...

01:09:45.249 --> 01:09:49.252
that's never going
to happen, Eddie.

01:09:52.256 --> 01:09:53.756
Pull over the car.

01:10:18.582 --> 01:10:21.585
Stay, Luli.

01:10:21.585 --> 01:10:22.586
Luli, stay with me.

01:10:31.212 --> 01:10:35.716
I can't.

01:10:40.304 --> 01:10:42.806
I'm sorry.

01:10:42.806 --> 01:10:44.808
Please stay.

<i>Things you could find in a hardware store.</i>

Help me!

01:12:28.128 --> 01:12:30.580
What the fuck?

01:12:30.581 --> 01:12:33.300
What the fuck?

01:13:19.797 --> 01:13:21.298
I got you flowers.

01:13:34.395 --> 01:13:37.398
You like your
new haircut?

01:13:37.398 --> 01:13:40.401
What about the colour?

01:13:40.401 --> 01:13:44.621
You like the colour?

01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:47.874
Well, I think you
look real pretty.

01:13:47.875 --> 01:13:51.378
Now, I know what you
must be thinking.

01:13:51.378 --> 01:13:54.664
What happened back there,
that wasn't right.

01:13:54.665 --> 01:13:57.417
See, that wasn't right
and I know it.

01:14:00.721 --> 01:14:04.174
Now, I promise
as God is my witness

01:14:04.174 --> 01:14:06.976
that that will
never happen again.

01:14:06.977 --> 01:14:10.480
Besides,
I think that--

01:14:10.481 --> 01:14:12.483
I think you're
an angel.

01:14:12.483 --> 01:14:15.235
I think you were sent to be mine
and make things better.

01:14:15.235 --> 01:14:17.237
I think you were put on this
earth to save me, Luli.

01:14:17.237 --> 01:14:18.821
Like that Bonnie
and I'm Clyde.

01:14:18.822 --> 01:14:21.825
And to show you that I
mean business, which I do,

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:24.744
I'm going to
untie you right now.

01:14:24.745 --> 01:14:26.747
I will never--
I'm not going to do that again.

01:14:26.747 --> 01:14:29.750
I'm not going to tie
you up again, all right?

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:31.201
Look at me?

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:35.872
I will never tie
you up again.

01:14:35.873 --> 01:14:37.674
Except when I'm gone.

01:14:44.181 --> 01:14:46.683
I'm going to take
care of you forever.

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:48.685
You don't ever have to worry
about anything again.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:50.687
Do you hear me?

01:14:50.687 --> 01:14:55.024
I will take
care of you.

01:14:55.025 --> 01:14:57.861
Here, I got you something.

01:14:57.861 --> 01:15:02.866
I got you--

01:15:02.866 --> 01:15:04.367
I made this for you.

01:15:04.368 --> 01:15:08.872
I went into the town
and I made this for you.

01:15:08.872 --> 01:15:11.324
Do you like it?

01:15:11.325 --> 01:15:13.827
It says "hot stuff."

01:15:13.827 --> 01:15:15.829
Do you like it?

01:15:15.829 --> 01:15:17.330
Sure.

01:15:17.331 --> 01:15:20.334
I'm glad because I've
been waiting to give that

01:15:20.334 --> 01:15:21.501
to you all day.

01:15:21.502 --> 01:15:22.503
I was nervous.

01:15:38.602 --> 01:15:40.487
Well, hi there, Beau.

01:15:40.487 --> 01:15:41.988
I thought you'd
be in Reno.

01:15:41.989 --> 01:15:43.774
Headed there.

01:15:43.774 --> 01:15:45.776
May I come in?

01:15:45.776 --> 01:15:47.944
Yeah.
How's Carl?

01:15:47.945 --> 01:15:50.914
Well, he's getting a little
long in the tooth.

01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:55.501
Hello. So it's just
a matter of time.

01:15:55.502 --> 01:15:58.004
How long you
plan on staying?

01:15:58.005 --> 01:16:01.091
Oh, it could be
some time now, Beau. Why?

01:16:01.091 --> 01:16:03.593
Well, we going to get busy.

01:16:03.594 --> 01:16:04.962
We may need the room.
You understand.

01:16:04.962 --> 01:16:08.465
Seeing as I'm a long-time
customer and all,

01:16:08.465 --> 01:16:12.635
I figure I'm entitled
to stay as long as I want.

01:16:12.636 --> 01:16:14.638
Suit yourself.

01:16:14.638 --> 01:16:18.141
So are those your
pamphlets , mister?

01:16:18.141 --> 01:16:19.859
Yes, I believe they are.

01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:23.647
You kill your
own chickens?

01:16:23.647 --> 01:16:25.565
Affirmative.

01:16:25.566 --> 01:16:27.868
Don't you feel
sorry for them?

01:16:27.868 --> 01:16:30.453
Negative.

01:16:30.454 --> 01:16:34.241
Do you name them
before you kill them?

01:16:34.241 --> 01:16:37.244
Nope, I name them
after I kill them.

01:16:37.244 --> 01:16:38.912
Yeah, lunch and dinner.

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:43.916
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:55.512
You take care
of yourself now.

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:04.320
See you, Beau.

01:17:04.321 --> 01:17:08.775
Beau fucking Hopkins,
Beau fucking Hopkins.

01:17:08.775 --> 01:17:10.777
Shit, shit.

01:17:10.777 --> 01:17:13.496
Dammit, fuck,
shit, Luli!

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:20.003
Eddie, where are we?

01:17:20.003 --> 01:17:21.204
Where are we?

01:17:21.204 --> 01:17:25.374
We're in the Wild
fucking West, darling.

01:17:27.544 --> 01:17:30.964
Did you try to sell me off?

01:17:34.101 --> 01:17:37.554
That, you just talking about
chickens, what--?

01:17:45.779 --> 01:17:49.149
I trust you.

01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:55.789
Yeah.

01:18:12.305 --> 01:18:15.308
<i>Then we all waited</i>

01:18:15.308 --> 01:18:17.677
<i>while my baby brother stayed
right there in that incubator</i>

01:18:17.678 --> 01:18:21.565
<i>for three whole days
before deciding</i>

01:18:21.565 --> 01:18:24.901
<i>that, you know,
maybe this wasn't the place</i>

01:18:24.901 --> 01:18:27.904
<i>for him after all.</i>

01:18:27.904 --> 01:18:29.906
<i>And there goes my
baby blue brother,</i>

01:18:29.906 --> 01:18:32.992
<i>somewhere into
that night sky.</i>

01:18:32.993 --> 01:18:36.780
<i>And I wonder if I'll ever
get to see him someday.</i>

01:18:38.782 --> 01:18:40.784
<i>And I would have played</i>

01:18:40.784 --> 01:18:42.252
<i>whatever silly
little dumb game</i>

01:18:42.252 --> 01:18:46.756
<i>he had in mind, really.</i>

01:18:46.757 --> 01:18:50.761
<i>Sometimes I wonder what he
would have looked like by now.</i>

01:18:50.761 --> 01:18:52.712
<i>I wonder what it
would have been like</i>

01:18:52.713 --> 01:18:56.133
<i>to just float up off
this planet with him.</i>

01:18:56.133 --> 01:18:58.101
<i>Maybe we can just
find our own planet.</i>

01:18:58.101 --> 01:19:02.522
<i>Make it with just kings
and cowboys and castles.</i>

01:19:02.522 --> 01:19:04.524
<i>Make it a planet
with just pirates</i>

01:19:04.524 --> 01:19:06.692
<i>or train heists
and dragons.</i>

01:19:06.693 --> 01:19:09.028
<i>And we'd say,
"Walk the plank, matey."</i>

01:19:09.029 --> 01:19:11.281
<i>Or crack that
there safe.</i>

01:19:11.281 --> 01:19:12.148
<i>And make it snappy."</i>

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:17.153
<i>And I'd slay any dragon
any day of the week</i>

01:19:17.154 --> 01:19:20.707
<i>for my little
kid brother.</i>

01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:24.577
<i>Nothing would
have made me happier.</i>

01:19:35.722 --> 01:19:40.143
This is how he
made me, right here.

01:19:42.145 --> 01:19:45.481
I was your age.

01:19:45.482 --> 01:19:50.270
Must have been
a spitting image.

01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:55.275
But I thought
I wanted to be here,

01:19:55.275 --> 01:19:57.193
because we were
in love.

01:20:08.121 --> 01:20:10.623
I'm sorry, Luli.

01:20:10.624 --> 01:20:12.175
Stop.

01:20:12.175 --> 01:20:14.177
Let me help.
Stop.

01:20:14.177 --> 01:20:18.214
Hey, I know, Luli.

01:20:21.218 --> 01:20:24.888
I used to think I
couldn't live without him.

01:20:24.888 --> 01:20:28.892
I used to think
I couldn't eat...

01:20:30.393 --> 01:20:34.397
or sleep or breathe.

01:20:35.782 --> 01:20:40.286
You know that
boy you met, Angel?

01:20:41.154 --> 01:20:45.541
That's my baby.

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:48.544
He's mine and Eddie's.

01:20:51.047 --> 01:20:53.049
And I knew
when I had him

01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:55.051
I had to get away,

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:57.420
because I didn't know
what Eddie would do to him.

01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.923
And so everything I've
done has been for him.

01:21:04.427 --> 01:21:06.429
I don't even know if
what I'm doing is right

01:21:06.429 --> 01:21:09.932
because I must be
really fucked, you know?

01:21:11.852 --> 01:21:15.822
You gave him $1,000
to get me out of your hair.

01:21:15.822 --> 01:21:18.825
He told you that?

01:21:18.825 --> 01:21:20.827
I didn't give him
any fucking money.

01:21:20.827 --> 01:21:22.361
Do you hear me?

01:21:22.362 --> 01:21:25.865
I would not do
that to you.

01:21:25.866 --> 01:21:30.620
He's broken and he's
no good to nobody.

01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:34.624
Did you get rid of me?

01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:36.375
Got tired of
having me around?

01:21:36.376 --> 01:21:40.880
I've been looking
for you since you left.

01:21:41.882 --> 01:21:44.184
When I saw that note--

01:21:44.184 --> 01:21:48.605
I'm so sorry, Luli.

01:21:48.605 --> 01:21:51.107
You're all right,
though, baby.

01:21:51.107 --> 01:21:55.144
Come on, let's sing one
of them happy songs.

01:21:55.145 --> 01:21:57.530
Enough of this.
Come on.

01:22:01.151 --> 01:22:02.652
Come on, Luli.

01:22:08.124 --> 01:22:12.578
I called Kimball
and found out

01:22:12.579 --> 01:22:14.581
that old gomer
made it.

01:22:14.581 --> 01:22:16.082
Wouldn't that just be
(Unclear).

01:22:36.736 --> 01:22:41.524
Did you lose
something, Luli?

01:22:41.524 --> 01:22:44.443
Eddie, put that
thing down.

01:22:44.444 --> 01:22:46.946
You going to take her too?

01:22:46.947 --> 01:22:48.448
Quit it.

01:22:48.448 --> 01:22:50.666
Is that the idea?
That the plan here, Glen?

01:22:50.667 --> 01:22:54.170
You take off yourself and then
you leave me with nothing?

01:22:55.789 --> 01:22:58.291
What the fuck
do you want from me?

01:22:58.291 --> 01:22:59.875
What more could
I do for you?

01:22:59.876 --> 01:23:03.846
Well, maybe--
Maybe you ain't leaving.

01:23:14.224 --> 01:23:15.525
Come on, Eddie.

01:23:15.525 --> 01:23:18.027
How's that, baby?
How does that feel?

01:23:18.028 --> 01:23:20.030
It's nice.

01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:22.282
Now why don't you just
put that gun down?

01:23:22.282 --> 01:23:24.284
The gun is not
the problem here.

01:23:24.284 --> 01:23:25.985
Is the gun the problem
for you, Luli?

01:23:25.986 --> 01:23:26.987
Look at me.

01:23:26.987 --> 01:23:28.071
The gun is not
a problem for me.

01:23:28.071 --> 01:23:29.906
It's not about Luli.

01:23:29.906 --> 01:23:32.158
Come on.
This gun, touch it.

01:23:32.158 --> 01:23:33.659
Feel it.
Stop. Stop that, Eddie.

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:35.662
You put that gun down.

01:23:35.662 --> 01:23:36.546
You going to slap
me again?

01:23:36.546 --> 01:23:38.080
Come on!
Don't do this.

01:23:38.081 --> 01:23:41.501
Don't fucking
touch me!

01:23:41.501 --> 01:23:44.887
The gun, this fucking gun,
ain't even loaded. You see?

01:23:58.318 --> 01:24:01.654
Oh, my God!

01:24:01.654 --> 01:24:03.656
Fuck!

01:24:03.656 --> 01:24:06.108
Glen?
Come here.

01:24:10.113 --> 01:24:13.032
This is a fucking
accident.

01:24:13.033 --> 01:24:16.870
Fuck!

01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:19.873
Glenda?

01:24:25.762 --> 01:24:28.214
Glenda?

01:24:30.683 --> 01:24:34.103
Luli-- We gotta--
We gotta go.

01:24:36.439 --> 01:24:40.526
We got--
We gotta get this--

01:24:41.978 --> 01:24:42.979
This is a fucking
accident.

01:24:45.315 --> 01:24:48.067
We gotta go, Luli.

01:24:49.569 --> 01:24:51.571
Actually, I know
a place we can go

01:24:51.571 --> 01:24:52.989
where no one will find us.

01:24:52.989 --> 01:24:53.990
We'll be like Bonnie and Clyde.

01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:55.408
<i>Pow.</i>

01:25:03.299 --> 01:25:05.301
I'm sorry.

01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:08.982
Now lookit,
I made you some eggs.

01:26:08.982 --> 01:26:10.817
Just sit.

01:26:10.817 --> 01:26:13.119
There's a secret
to the eggs, you know?

01:26:13.119 --> 01:26:17.123
Family secret,
guarded.

01:26:24.831 --> 01:26:28.334
Okay.

01:26:28.334 --> 01:26:31.587
Okay.

01:26:31.588 --> 01:26:34.090
Please,
humour me.

01:26:46.519 --> 01:26:50.689
Okay, now, Luli,
listen to me.

01:26:51.691 --> 01:26:53.609
I know firearms.

01:26:53.610 --> 01:26:55.411
I know bullets.

01:26:55.411 --> 01:26:56.412
I know which
way they go.

01:26:56.412 --> 01:27:00.416
I know which way
they don't go.

01:27:00.416 --> 01:27:02.284
They didn't give me
this for nothing.

01:27:04.671 --> 01:27:07.840
I also know how to make it
look like maybe two people

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:11.343
maybe had a
love-sick quarrel

01:27:11.344 --> 01:27:14.213
and maybe they
killed each other.

01:27:14.214 --> 01:27:18.351
And I also know how
to make it look

01:27:18.351 --> 01:27:23.356
like a third person
was never there.

01:27:23.356 --> 01:27:26.275
Poof, never there.

01:27:29.145 --> 01:27:31.897
Why?

01:27:31.898 --> 01:27:33.900
Because I never should have
set foot out of that cabin

01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.401
in the first place.

01:27:35.401 --> 01:27:37.903
So this is all I got.

01:27:37.904 --> 01:27:40.406
Now, would you
please eat

01:27:40.406 --> 01:27:44.209
your fluffy, goddamn
delicious eggs?

01:27:46.462 --> 01:27:49.915
My sister is the one
that taught me to cook.

01:27:49.916 --> 01:27:54.387
She called it
bachelor training.

01:27:54.387 --> 01:27:55.888
She lives in LA.

01:27:55.888 --> 01:27:58.390
Works at some weird school

01:27:58.391 --> 01:27:59.892
where they got
hobbit huts

01:27:59.892 --> 01:28:04.346
and everybody
speaks French.

01:28:04.347 --> 01:28:05.564
You should look her up.
She'd like you.

01:28:05.565 --> 01:28:08.985
She always wanted
a daughter.

01:28:08.985 --> 01:28:12.772
Look, I'm not some
kind of charity case.

01:28:12.772 --> 01:28:17.193
Oh, I know, independent.

01:28:18.194 --> 01:28:22.531
Well, I reckon I best
get you home then.

01:28:22.532 --> 01:28:25.868
Hey, where are
you from anyway?

01:28:25.868 --> 01:28:30.205
Palmyra, Nebraska.

01:28:32.208 --> 01:28:37.213
You know,
it's not so bad.

01:28:37.213 --> 01:28:38.797
We got a good
football team.

01:28:38.798 --> 01:28:40.800
Yeah, I know.

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.804
The bus station is about
two hours down the road.

01:28:44.804 --> 01:28:46.305
I'll give you a ride

01:28:46.306 --> 01:28:49.726
if that doesn't offend
your sensibilities.

01:28:52.145 --> 01:28:55.648
No.

01:28:55.648 --> 01:28:58.150
That doesn't
offend me at all.

01:29:19.589 --> 01:29:22.091
Mama?

01:29:22.091 --> 01:29:23.092
<i>Oh, my God, Luli?</i>

01:29:23.092 --> 01:29:24.593
<i>It's Luli.</i>

01:29:24.594 --> 01:29:26.596
<i>We've been worried sick,
just sick with this.</i>

01:29:26.596 --> 01:29:27.597
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:29:27.597 --> 01:29:30.650
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

01:29:30.650 --> 01:29:31.651
Tomorrow.

01:29:31.651 --> 01:29:33.152
<i>Oh, that is great.</i>

01:29:33.152 --> 01:29:35.571
<i>Honey, that is
the best news ever.</i>

01:29:35.571 --> 01:29:37.573
<i>Oh, my God, Luli,</i>

01:29:37.573 --> 01:29:38.574
<i>you're never going
to believe this.</i>

01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:40.576
<i>But I sold it.</i>

01:29:40.576 --> 01:29:42.578
<i>I sold it all to Lux,</i>

01:29:42.578 --> 01:29:45.080
<i>and now they're going
to build a Walmart</i>

01:29:45.081 --> 01:29:47.083
<i>right here in Palmyra.</i>

01:29:47.083 --> 01:29:49.618
Mom, the bus drop's down
at Lincoln, 7:00 a.m.

01:29:49.619 --> 01:29:51.621
Can you pick me up?

01:29:51.621 --> 01:29:53.873
<i>Well, oh, that's a
little early, honey.</i>

01:29:53.873 --> 01:29:56.375
Mom, put Daddy
on the phone.

01:29:56.376 --> 01:29:58.878
<i>Oh, baby, your daddy,</i>

01:29:58.878 --> 01:30:03.382
<i>he never made it back,
so he's gone.</i>

01:30:05.385 --> 01:30:08.388
<i>Oh, but, sweetie,
you're going to love Lux.</i>

01:30:08.388 --> 01:30:12.892
<i>I mean, yeah, he's a gem
and we're moving, hon.</i>

01:30:12.892 --> 01:30:15.394
<i>We're just-- We're moving
on and we're moving up!</i>

01:30:15.395 --> 01:30:17.897
<i>Sweetie, do you hear this?</i>

01:30:17.897 --> 01:30:20.399
<i>Honey, I can't hear you.</i>

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.901
<i>Speak up.</i>

01:30:21.901 --> 01:30:25.704
<i>Oh, we're in a bit
of a celebration here,</i>

01:30:25.705 --> 01:30:28.708
<i>so it's hard
to hear everything--</i>

01:31:25.214 --> 01:31:27.716
I need you to pull
over the bus.

01:31:27.717 --> 01:31:29.218
Look, kid, why don't you
go back to your seat?

01:31:29.218 --> 01:31:31.720
Look, I'm real sorry and all,
but I'm an epileptic and I--

01:31:31.721 --> 01:31:34.223
Now, look,
I can't stop the bus.

01:31:34.223 --> 01:31:36.725
Look at me!
Look at me!

01:31:36.726 --> 01:31:40.229
If I don't get my medicine,
I'm going to have a sei--

01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:42.314
Oh, shit.

01:32:12.845 --> 01:32:17.850
<i>You could shake your knuckles at the sky.</i>

01:32:17.850 --> 01:32:21.486
<i>You could get mad and say,
"I don't got nothing."</i>

01:32:24.490 --> 01:32:27.993
<i>You could get stuck.</i>

01:32:34.283 --> 01:32:35.284
<i>You could grab the past</i>

01:32:35.284 --> 01:32:39.288
<i>and drag it with you
like a back of rocks.</i>

01:32:41.791 --> 01:32:44.293
<i>You could grab that
new diet with grapefruits</i>

01:32:44.293 --> 01:32:45.794
<i>and a brand-new
exerciser</i>

01:32:45.795 --> 01:32:49.799
<i>and maybe that new and
improved washer-dryer set.</i>

01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:53.802
<i>You could grab and grab
and grab and grab</i>

01:32:53.803 --> 01:32:57.807
<i>until your fists
turn green.</i>

01:32:57.807 --> 01:33:00.309
<i>You could grab
everything you ever wanted.</i>

01:33:00.309 --> 01:33:04.696
<i>Shake it.
Try to make it go boom.</i>

01:33:13.573 --> 01:33:17.577
<i>Yet you could never,
ever grab enough.</i>

01:33:20.546 --> 01:33:22.497
<i>Pow.</i>

01:34:40.493 --> 01:34:43.913
That was the end,
back just before I coughed.

01:34:43.913 --> 01:34:50.886
It fades out.
