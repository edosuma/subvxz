00:15.932 --> 00:17.200
I told them the truth.

00:17.201 --> 00:18.403
What did they say?

00:18.404 --> 00:21.241
They just packed their stuff and left.

00:21.242 --> 00:22.878

00:22.879 --> 00:24.782
<i>Perhaps I should just
talk to your boss.</i>

00:24.783 --> 00:26.619
For some reason, he's
gotten it into his head

00:26.620 --> 00:28.189
that I don't pass muster.

00:28.190 --> 00:29.759
It can't be a coincidence
that it happened

00:29.760 --> 00:32.397
right after my fiancée
called off our wedding.

00:32.398 --> 00:34.769

00:44.957 --> 00:49.297
with your wife about what
did not happen between us.

00:49.298 --> 00:50.801

00:53.941 --> 00:56.446
<i>I don't think he even
saw you, thank God.</i>

00:56.447 --> 00:58.115
Why would it be so bad
if he did see me?

00:58.116 --> 01:00.319
There are reasons that we
shouldn't be together.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.725
Reasons that I am no
longer afraid to say.

You know, they have apartments
that come already furnished.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.604
Oh, no, this was furnished.
It was quite cluttered.

03:22.605 --> 03:25.911
So I stacked everything up
and threw a cover on it.

03:25.912 --> 03:28.883
You know, I've tried
to simplify things.

03:28.884 --> 03:30.954

how little it takes

03:30.955 --> 03:32.356

03:32.357 --> 03:34.260
Coffee table comes in handy.

03:34.261 --> 03:36.599
Maybe... sofa

03:36.600 --> 03:38.604
for when you have guests.

03:44.048 --> 03:47.053
Uh, you wanted to celebrate?

03:47.054 --> 03:50.493
Yes, uh, I just heard
from Arnold Ketterman

03:50.494 --> 03:52.263

03:52.264 --> 03:55.169

The book was as good

04:00.948 --> 04:03.787
I suppose it was my trip to

04:28.671 --> 04:32.611
Oh, uh, after months of AA,

06:37.695 --> 06:38.796
why would it be awkward?

06:38.797 --> 06:40.900
It's just a date, Bill.

06:43.640 --> 06:47.414
as it would be for you.

06:47.415 --> 06:50.085
"Friar Bill"... it does

06:50.086 --> 06:51.589
All that's missing from his apartment

06:51.590 --> 06:54.093
is a monk's robe and a hair shirt.

06:54.094 --> 06:56.832
I do appreciate the
drink. And the company.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.270

06:59.271 --> 07:01.542
Plus you cleared things up with Nancy.

07:01.543 --> 07:03.211

07:07.955 --> 07:09.558

07:09.559 --> 07:13.131
Honestly, I-I find that man
completely inscrutable.

07:13.132 --> 07:16.204
And I have always understood him,

07:16.205 --> 07:17.874
but these past few months, he's been...

07:17.875 --> 07:19.210
Well, he's in the middle of a divorce.

07:19.211 --> 07:20.713
That doesn't explain this.

07:20.714 --> 07:23.486
Come on. Erratic,
uncharacteristic behavior,

07:23.487 --> 07:25.389
isolating himself from those
with whom he was once close.

07:25.390 --> 07:27.761
Yes, traditionally those
would be symptoms

07:27.762 --> 07:29.498
of a man coming out of a long marriage,

07:29.499 --> 07:31.802
but every marriage is different.

07:31.803 --> 07:34.508
For example, I nearly sent
out celebration notices

07:34.509 --> 07:36.110
when I got divorced.

07:36.111 --> 07:37.947
Each time.

07:37.948 --> 07:40.486
But even an unfulfilling
marriage can provide

07:40.487 --> 07:43.426
a certain kind of, uh, stability.

07:43.427 --> 07:45.663
At Kinsey, we found men
typically took divorce

07:45.664 --> 07:47.434
much harder than women.

07:47.435 --> 07:50.873
And women were able to establish
new routines, create new lives.

07:50.874 --> 07:55.382
Whereas husbands, used to
having their laundry pressed,

07:55.383 --> 07:56.885
dinners cooked, they
floundered without wives.

07:56.886 --> 07:58.723
And yet here you are,

07:58.724 --> 08:00.727

08:15.089 --> 08:18.629
Bill's relationship that most
resembled a true marriage

was with me.

21:03.659 --> 21:05.294
Hey, you're still new to this work.

21:05.295 --> 21:08.333
What you'll learn is how to
pay attention to details.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.672
Well, details are what the
intake process is for,

21:10.673 --> 21:12.241
and we've yet to begin that.

21:12.242 --> 21:14.913
Of course, but given the sensitivity

21:14.914 --> 21:16.617
of this particular case,

21:16.618 --> 21:19.188
it makes most sense for us to
conduct the intake ourselves.

21:19.189 --> 21:22.862
Well, Nancy is perfectly capable
of conducting an intake.

21:22.863 --> 21:24.265
Oh, I'm sure she is.

21:24.266 --> 21:26.437
Oh, yes, she and Art
did an excellent job

21:26.438 --> 21:29.009
on the interview with the
Clavermores in our absence.

21:31.213 --> 21:33.651
You and Art took the Clavermores?

21:33.652 --> 21:35.220
They'd come all the way
from Philadelphia.

21:35.221 --> 21:37.726
Typically, the Clavermores
are the types of patients

21:37.727 --> 21:39.696
that we cultivate as donors.

21:39.697 --> 21:41.199
Well, after being on the
wait list for months,

21:41.200 --> 21:42.702
were we supposed to turn them away?

21:42.703 --> 21:45.742
No, just reschedule them.

21:45.743 --> 21:49.683
Unless you disagree, Bill.

21:49.684 --> 21:52.055
You should have consulted
with us before seeing them.

21:53.759 --> 21:55.595
I need to think about this,

21:55.596 --> 22:00.037
how to handle the Clavermores
from here on out.

Dr. Masters told me he

23:48.955 --> 23:52.829
Well, aside from that
technicality which, frankly,

23:52.830 --> 23:55.333
is debatable, you need to understand

23:55.334 --> 23:57.639
that there are many

23:57.640 --> 23:59.041

23:59.042 --> 24:00.978

24:11.768 --> 24:13.570

slice of the pie,

24:13.571 --> 24:14.773
they tend to fight over it,

24:14.774 --> 24:16.410

24:16.411 --> 24:19.081
- Or share.
- First of all, I hate pie.

25:04.305 --> 25:07.645

25:35.067 --> 25:37.204
It may be five.

25:42.950 --> 25:44.385
how many were there?

25:48.461 --> 25:50.931
It's a standard question.

25:50.932 --> 25:53.236
Have you had sexual
experiences with men?

...one boy. Once.

26:23.698 --> 26:25.534
When I had just turned 16.

26:25.535 --> 26:26.870
He was a year ahead of me.

26:26.871 --> 26:28.105
He was your classmate.

26:28.106 --> 26:29.943
At boarding school.

26:29.944 --> 26:31.479
It wasn't even sexual.

Feelings? What do feelings
mean when you're 16?

26:42.803 --> 26:45.474

There are no others. It
was just the one boy.

He graduated the next year.
I never saw him again.

26:52.456 --> 26:53.490

26:53.491 --> 26:54.792
No.

26:54.793 --> 26:56.863
Well, from time to time.

26:56.864 --> 26:58.332

26:58.333 --> 26:59.502
Not if I can help it.

26:59.503 --> 27:01.673
Does it help you to achieve erection?

No.

27:09.288 --> 27:13.062

27:13.063 --> 27:16.836
I find it nauseating.

27:16.837 --> 27:18.807
And sometimes arousing.
