00:00.100 --> 00:01.748
Previously on "switched at birth"...

00:01.768 --> 00:04.067
- Are you okay?
- This is your fault.

00:04.088 --> 00:06.518
He died of an aneurysm.

00:06.538 --> 00:08.339
Why are you defending her?

00:08.373 --> 00:09.474
Bay: It's hereditary.

00:09.508 --> 00:10.541
That doesn't necessarily mean...

00:10.576 --> 00:12.310
That's there's a ticking time bomb

00:12.344 --> 00:14.245
in my brain that could
go off at any moment?

00:14.484 --> 00:17.473
_

00:17.493 --> 00:21.041
_

00:21.061 --> 00:23.166
Do you know a guy named Emmett Bledsoe?

00:23.186 --> 00:25.260
- No.
- He thinks he's in a relationship with you

00:25.280 --> 00:27.587
and that your name is Mandy Starling.

00:27.607 --> 00:29.611
Daphne, this is Wes.

00:29.631 --> 00:31.721
We're just breaking ground on
the east riverside project.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.396
Look, if you're really pissed at your ma

00:33.416 --> 00:35.568
and you need her to know,
then you gotta show her.

00:35.588 --> 00:38.473
Daphne:
There's a groundbreaking ceremony tomorrow.

00:39.124 --> 00:41.017
Bad girl, huh?

00:48.079 --> 00:51.165
John: So you got the full payout
on Angelo's insurance, huh?

00:51.185 --> 00:52.883
You don't think I should have?

00:52.917 --> 00:55.819
Oh, I'm not saying that at all.
You deserve every penny.

00:55.853 --> 00:57.973
I just, you know, figured they'd try

00:57.993 --> 01:01.044
some kind of pre-existing-
condition nonsense.

01:01.308 --> 01:02.392
They didn't.

01:02.426 --> 01:04.394
Now I just have to figure
out what to do with it.

01:04.428 --> 01:05.428
Hmm.

01:05.462 --> 01:08.565
So I'm thinking...
College fund, investments?

01:08.599 --> 01:10.467
Well, I'll put you in touch
with my financial guy,

01:10.501 --> 01:12.135
he can run you through some options.

01:12.169 --> 01:13.851
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:14.332 --> 01:16.070
I hope Bay needs a college fund.

01:16.090 --> 01:19.074
I think she'll try for art school again.
She just needs some time.

01:19.094 --> 01:20.602
(Door opens)
Hmm.

01:20.622 --> 01:23.875
Well, we got one on the right path.
(Chuckles)

01:23.895 --> 01:26.776
I thought you were going out for a run.

01:26.796 --> 01:30.193
- I didn't feel like it.
- Um, I should get going.

01:31.154 --> 01:34.726
I will... I will call my financial guy
later today, okay?

01:34.746 --> 01:37.129
- What's going on?
- Um,

01:37.414 --> 01:40.392
Angelo's life insurance policy
came through.

01:41.795 --> 01:43.189
How much?

01:43.209 --> 01:45.398
- One million.
- And you're taking it?

01:45.418 --> 01:47.267
John: Wait, wait, sweetie,
that's what it's for.

01:47.287 --> 01:50.035
To take care of you, and bay, and Regina.

01:50.055 --> 01:51.993
There's a lot to think through.

01:52.013 --> 01:54.276
- Thanks so much for your help.
- No problem, any time.

01:54.296 --> 01:55.934
Okay.

02:00.104 --> 02:02.650
Like John said,

02:02.670 --> 02:04.512
it's for all of us.

02:04.532 --> 02:07.118
I don't want it. It's blood money.

02:07.138 --> 02:08.880
How is it blood money?

02:08.900 --> 02:11.560
Angelo is dead because of you

02:11.580 --> 02:14.607
and now you get a million dollars?

02:18.401 --> 02:20.800
(Door opens, closes)
(Sighs)

02:23.888 --> 02:25.607
(Phone clicking)

02:28.814 --> 02:31.743
_

02:32.698 --> 02:35.450
Bay: So basically, this could kill me.

02:36.253 --> 02:38.417
Where there's a family
history of aneurysms,

02:38.437 --> 02:40.365
there is a higher risk factor.

02:40.385 --> 02:43.170
But it's by no means a guarantee...

02:43.190 --> 02:44.525
Especially at your age.

02:44.545 --> 02:48.020
Even though my aunt died of one
at exactly my age?

02:48.040 --> 02:51.242
That's why it's a good thing
we're getting the M.R.I. today.

02:52.111 --> 02:53.802
So, uh...

02:54.382 --> 02:57.999
If you find something, then what do we do?

02:58.019 --> 03:00.469
Those are things I can discuss
with you and your family

03:00.489 --> 03:02.281
when we get the results.

03:02.417 --> 03:03.745
Okay.

03:03.765 --> 03:06.192
You have someone here with you today?

03:06.416 --> 03:09.617
I kind of just want to keep this
off the radar for right now.

03:09.651 --> 03:11.775
That's not what I would recommend.

03:11.795 --> 03:13.435
But it's legal.

03:13.455 --> 03:15.952
Since I'm 18,
I have the right to confidential treatment.

03:15.972 --> 03:19.393
Bay, I know this is scary.

03:19.428 --> 03:22.202
But you will do better
with a support system.

03:23.344 --> 03:25.898
The problem is my support system

03:25.918 --> 03:27.268
just went through hell with Angelo,

03:27.302 --> 03:29.036
so until we know for sure that this is

03:29.071 --> 03:31.072
something to worry about...

03:31.106 --> 03:34.493
I would really rather not put them
through anything else right now.

03:35.312 --> 03:36.563
Okay.

03:37.431 --> 03:39.442
You ready for the scan?

03:39.826 --> 03:41.482
As ready as I'll ever be.

03:51.454 --> 03:54.028
No, I understand. Absolutely.

03:54.062 --> 03:56.021
Guys, I need to jump off.

03:56.281 --> 03:57.775
Yeah, okay, send me the notes.

03:57.795 --> 03:58.962
Thanks.
(Beeps)

03:58.982 --> 04:01.024
(Sighs) Sounds like you're back
in the swing of things.

04:01.044 --> 04:04.522
Yeah, I don't know why
Wes puts me on calls with contractors.

04:04.542 --> 04:08.228
I'm like, "guys, I do interiors.
Call me when it's done."

04:08.248 --> 04:10.226
Well, it's nice he wants your input.

04:10.246 --> 04:11.802
- Yeah...
- Guess what?!

04:11.822 --> 04:14.073
I got invited to go to New York tomorrow.

04:14.093 --> 04:16.605
My publisher is throwing a party
for all the new releases.

04:16.625 --> 04:17.966
Here is the fun part...

04:17.986 --> 04:20.587
they offered me a plus
one for everything...

04:20.622 --> 04:22.856
flight, hotel, everything.

04:22.891 --> 04:24.715
Great, I can water plants

04:24.735 --> 04:26.180
or do whatever you need.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.288
Actually,
I was hoping that you would come with me.

04:29.308 --> 04:31.532
John hates New York and...

04:31.566 --> 04:32.933
to be honest, I'm a little nervous.

04:32.967 --> 04:35.381
There's gonna be all
these fancy writers and...

04:35.401 --> 04:37.818
I could use some company.

04:37.838 --> 04:39.740
(Sighs) That's really sweet of you

04:39.774 --> 04:42.416
but I'm still kind of in the thick of it.

04:42.436 --> 04:43.944
It's one day.

04:43.978 --> 04:44.922
One.

04:44.942 --> 04:46.238
Please.

04:50.683 --> 04:53.654
Excellent! I'll email you the info.

Yeah, they should just lay off.

We're seniors and we're almost out of here.

07:15.361 --> 07:17.816

07:17.836 --> 07:19.516
_

07:19.536 --> 07:21.476
- What was that?
- Oh...

07:21.496 --> 07:24.678
All the seniors at Heyward
are skipping school tomorrow.

07:24.698 --> 07:26.311
- We should do that, too.
- No, not me.

07:26.331 --> 07:27.838
Oh, come on,
you're not gonna get in trouble

07:27.858 --> 07:30.302
if the whole class does it together.

07:31.481 --> 07:33.186
_

07:33.206 --> 07:35.383
Eww, I hate water parks.

07:35.403 --> 07:37.577
They're just... germ soup.

07:37.597 --> 07:40.650
Mmm, I think Hawkeye Ranch
just opened for the summer.

07:45.068 --> 07:47.227
_

07:47.574 --> 07:49.626
Guess where you're going tomorrow?

07:49.646 --> 07:51.210
(Sighs)

07:54.170 --> 07:56.714
I had a really weird morning.

07:56.938 --> 07:58.417
_

07:58.437 --> 08:00.276
Okay, well you first.

08:00.296 --> 08:02.224
_

08:04.176 --> 08:05.290
Wait, what?

08:05.310 --> 08:07.286
I didn't even know you applied.

08:07.608 --> 08:12.722
_

08:12.742 --> 08:15.075
Emmett, that's amazing.

08:15.956 --> 08:19.915

Why wouldn't you go?

08:23.326 --> 08:27.997

08:28.017 --> 08:31.231
You applied. You obviously want to.

08:31.803 --> 08:34.347
_

08:34.366 --> 08:36.630
Oh, uh, well...

08:38.417 --> 08:41.562
_

08:41.582 --> 08:43.418
_

08:43.630 --> 08:45.541

exactly what I need right now.

I am not getting wet.

10:49.493 --> 10:50.493
(Laughing)

10:50.528 --> 10:52.185
That goes for me too.

10:52.205 --> 10:53.716
_

10:53.736 --> 10:55.622
Yeah, that will not be happening.

10:55.973 --> 10:58.549
_

10:58.827 --> 11:02.600
Right? Ms. Summers can suck it.

11:09.170 --> 11:11.813
_

11:17.380 --> 11:20.371
_

11:20.979 --> 11:23.460
Beer is on its way.

11:23.994 --> 11:25.161
(Laughs)

11:39.478 --> 11:41.203
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:43.012 --> 11:44.405
Um...

11:49.837 --> 11:51.964
It's been a while since I've been here.

11:51.984 --> 11:55.252
Yeah, you know,
some kids thought it'd be cool,

11:55.272 --> 11:56.488
but it's kinda lame.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.486
Well, this should help.

12:01.468 --> 12:03.297
Awesome, thanks.

12:03.317 --> 12:05.017
You got it.

12:08.057 --> 12:10.501
He's asking how we know each other.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.809
From East Riverside.

12:12.829 --> 12:15.142
Do you guys want some beers?

12:15.162 --> 12:18.351
You better be cool with that.
You don't want us getting kicked out.

12:20.479 --> 12:23.730
_

12:24.020 --> 12:27.234
Um, do you want to go ride the boats?

12:27.254 --> 12:28.557
Um, maybe later.

12:28.577 --> 12:31.362
I think we're gonna find
a place to just hang.

12:31.585 --> 12:34.564
Can I talk to you for a second?
Great, thanks.

12:35.643 --> 12:38.433
Is that who I think it is?

12:38.467 --> 12:40.260
I don't know. Who do you think it is?

12:40.280 --> 12:42.604
The guy who threw a brick
through Regina's window

12:42.638 --> 12:46.084
and then called her a whore
when we asked him about it.

12:47.412 --> 12:49.795
I invited him. He's cool.

12:50.167 --> 12:51.955
"He's cool"?

12:52.861 --> 12:54.777
Turns out we have some things in common.

12:54.797 --> 12:58.003
Seriously,
this is your new way to piss off Regina?

12:58.023 --> 13:01.156
Hanging out with the thug
who destroyed her property?

13:01.190 --> 13:02.743
Oh, very mature.

13:02.763 --> 13:03.830
He's not a thug.

13:03.850 --> 13:06.428
Couldn't you try to be
a little less obvious?

13:06.448 --> 13:09.377
You have no idea what you're talking about.

13:14.036 --> 13:15.484
(Idle chatter)

13:15.504 --> 13:17.472
Here we go.

13:17.506 --> 13:19.273
Here it is.

13:19.823 --> 13:21.131
What do you think?

13:21.151 --> 13:24.412
- (Kathryn gasps)
- Regina: Ooh, look at you.

13:24.897 --> 13:28.128
Lydia: Oh, I envy you two,
making a girls weekend of it.

13:28.148 --> 13:29.754
Kathryn: Oh,
thank you so much for including me.

13:29.774 --> 13:33.464
Oh, of course. I love seeing
the expense account put to good use.

13:33.484 --> 13:35.308
Kathryn, nice dress.

13:35.328 --> 13:39.043
Oh, I was just trying not to feel
like the out-of-town aunt.

13:39.063 --> 13:41.785
Oh, please. No one here bites...

13:41.805 --> 13:44.602
Except possibly Andrea Askowitz.

13:44.622 --> 13:47.407
(Gasps) Oh, I love her.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.075
She wrote this hilarious
memoir about her mother

13:50.095 --> 13:53.115
- called "Battle Axe."
- Ooh, no wonder she bites.

13:53.135 --> 13:55.590
Well, she did a new bio on Edith Wharton.

13:55.610 --> 13:57.945
And she is right over there.

13:57.979 --> 14:00.257
(Boisterous laughter)

14:00.277 --> 14:02.683
Her little algonquin table.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.965
I can take you over.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.730
I think I need to work up the nerve first.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.356
(Laughs) Well, that's what a bar is for.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.458
- What can I get you?
- Oh, nothing for me, thanks.

14:11.492 --> 14:12.626
Oh.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.361
Oh, excuse me.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.544
Robin's giving me the rescue signal.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.681
Um...

14:18.538 --> 14:20.441
Robin is her girlfriend.

14:20.461 --> 14:22.439
- Oh.
- Oh no, thank you.

14:22.459 --> 14:23.737
(Sighs)

14:23.757 --> 14:26.517
I am so sorry
this is such a boozy event.

14:26.537 --> 14:29.161
Well, it is a bunch of writers.

14:29.181 --> 14:30.439
I'm fine,

14:30.459 --> 14:33.479
and it's fun to see you in your element.

14:33.499 --> 14:36.664
Ah, well, I'm not sure I am.

14:39.648 --> 14:42.701
Deep fried kale?
Doesn't that defeat the purpose?

14:42.850 --> 14:44.530
_

14:44.550 --> 14:46.366
_

14:46.386 --> 14:47.503
(Scoffs)

14:54.096 --> 14:58.030
Um, maybe we should try the taco stand.

14:58.366 --> 15:00.592
_

15:00.612 --> 15:03.670
Okay, well,
why don't I hold our place in line

15:03.690 --> 15:07.053
and you go get me a veggie burrito?

15:07.984 --> 15:09.609
_

15:20.452 --> 15:22.132
Hey, I remember you.

15:22.152 --> 15:24.391
You came to see me at my school.

15:24.411 --> 15:26.079
Oh, yeah, right.

15:26.099 --> 15:29.207
Jennifer. You were asking about that thing
with my cousin Matthew.

15:29.227 --> 15:31.875
Oh, yeah,
I can't believe you remember that.

15:31.895 --> 15:34.208
No, totally. It turned into a huge thing.

15:34.228 --> 15:35.887
My mom and my aunt got in a big fight

15:35.907 --> 15:38.357
and then they made Matthew
show us all the stuff he wrote.

15:38.377 --> 15:41.653
It was so crazy.
He used me to trick that poor guy.

15:41.988 --> 15:44.760
Eh, well, he was pretty confused I'm sure.

15:44.780 --> 15:46.263
It's so weird that you're here.

15:46.283 --> 15:48.844
- Senior ditch day.
- Oh, cool, us too.

15:48.864 --> 15:51.835
- Okay, well I should probably go...
- Hey, is that guy here?

15:51.855 --> 15:53.458
Emmett?

15:53.493 --> 15:55.794
I... don't think so.

15:55.829 --> 15:58.118
(Dejected) Oh, too bad.

15:58.138 --> 16:00.365
I mean,
I'm sure it was a total nightmare for him,

16:00.400 --> 16:03.302
but he was so sweet to that Mandy girl.

16:03.336 --> 16:06.648
It almost made me wish I was her
after I read all that stuff he wrote.

16:06.668 --> 16:09.341
- Really?
- Oh man, he loved her,

16:09.375 --> 16:10.867
and she wasn't even real.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.145
It's like... tragic.

16:13.791 --> 16:15.147
After I read that stuff he wrote,

16:15.181 --> 16:17.321
I kind of dumped this guy I was seeing,
Chad,

16:17.341 --> 16:19.393
'cause it's like,
if I can't have a connection like that,

16:19.413 --> 16:21.676
then what's the point? You know?

16:21.696 --> 16:22.533
Right.

16:22.553 --> 16:25.506
I hope he finds someone that deserves him.

16:25.643 --> 16:27.756
Anyway, good to see you.

16:28.413 --> 16:29.758
You too.

16:29.778 --> 16:31.119
Ciao.

17:02.837 --> 17:03.765
- (Nacho sighs)
- Hey.

17:03.785 --> 17:05.056
I got you guys some burgers.

17:05.076 --> 17:08.776
Oh, cool, thanks. Here, you guys want some?

17:09.273 --> 17:11.098
So sweet.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.798
(Laughs)

17:13.281 --> 17:14.374
Damn, girl.

17:14.394 --> 17:17.518
Hey, I can't help it if I'm a good shot.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.752
Oh. (Chuckles)

17:21.036 --> 17:22.351
Who's that?

17:22.371 --> 17:24.980
- Oh, that's Romy.
- Well, no, I know that.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.518
I just...

17:26.538 --> 17:29.913
Like, are you here with me? Or...

17:30.198 --> 17:32.633
Look, it was cool the other night,

17:32.667 --> 17:35.274
but, you know,
it's not like we're together.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.686
No, I know.

17:39.456 --> 17:41.141
You wanna go hit the tank?

17:42.204 --> 17:44.586
- Maybe later.
- Cool.

17:44.810 --> 17:46.423
Could you grab me a beer?

17:46.808 --> 17:48.384
Rigo, you're up.

17:53.050 --> 17:54.712
- (Ball clangs)
- Nacho: Yeah!

17:54.732 --> 17:56.661
(Nacho laughs)

17:57.542 --> 17:59.478
Oh, that was... come on, now.

17:59.498 --> 18:01.608
You can't throw it like a girl.

18:01.628 --> 18:03.197
(Piano music playing)

18:04.383 --> 18:06.311
This is actually pretty good.

18:06.331 --> 18:08.594
- And I hate poetry.
- Well, let's go and meet her.

18:08.614 --> 18:11.939
And maybe I'll work up the nerve to talk
to Andrea Askowitz.

18:11.973 --> 18:13.923
Kathryn Kennish.

18:13.943 --> 18:14.875
Yes.

18:14.909 --> 18:18.178
Chris Washburn, chapter eight.

18:18.198 --> 18:21.008
Oh, hi. How are you doing?

18:21.028 --> 18:22.583
I'm doing good.

18:22.617 --> 18:25.781
Not the golden God I used to be,
you flatterer.

18:26.178 --> 18:29.021
Uh... well, you know...

18:29.041 --> 18:31.486
You know, I work in legal
and I just about fell out of my chair

18:31.506 --> 18:34.431
when I saw your name on the new releases.

18:34.451 --> 18:37.819
Course, you'll always be
Katie Dixon to me.

18:37.839 --> 18:40.644
That's me.
Katie Dixon. (Chuckles)

18:40.780 --> 18:42.127
So...

18:42.147 --> 18:45.498
You wrote it even hotter than I remembered.

18:47.359 --> 18:50.206
You know,
we should have snuck into that sleeper car.

18:50.226 --> 18:52.832
It would have been
better than the bathroom.

18:54.005 --> 18:56.412
- Oh...
- It's... it's okay.

18:57.206 --> 18:59.730
Your secret's safe with me.

18:59.750 --> 19:02.833
Once these people get wind
of a juicy tidbit like that...

19:02.853 --> 19:04.265
(mimics explosion)

19:04.712 --> 19:06.032
(Sighs)

19:06.052 --> 19:08.204
Mmm, mmm.

19:08.224 --> 19:10.160
You know what,
I think I need to go freshen this up.

19:10.180 --> 19:12.219
Just let me get that.

19:12.406 --> 19:14.039
We have a lot to catch up on.

19:19.707 --> 19:22.366
Oh my God.

19:22.763 --> 19:23.609
Who was that?

19:23.644 --> 19:26.398
Some guy who thinks I
wrote him into my book.

19:26.782 --> 19:28.414
- Did you?
- No.

19:28.449 --> 19:31.386
Not... not exactly.
But kind of.

19:31.796 --> 19:32.893
You remember that part

19:32.913 --> 19:37.134
where Shelly, the young wife,
has revenge sex on a train

19:37.154 --> 19:39.574
with a guy she just met?

19:43.696 --> 19:44.977
Him?

19:44.997 --> 19:46.920
Uh, well, it wasn't revenge sex...

19:46.940 --> 19:50.755
- Exactly.
- You and that guy?

19:50.775 --> 19:52.314
In the bathroom.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.247
- Of a train?
- I put paper towels down.

19:55.267 --> 19:56.309
(Sighs)

19:56.329 --> 19:59.850
- You are a wild woman.
- I only did it this one time.

19:59.870 --> 20:01.786
It was the craziest thing
I did in my whole life

20:01.806 --> 20:04.119
and I never thought I'd see the guy again.

20:04.139 --> 20:05.684
Looks like you were pretty unforgettable.

20:05.719 --> 20:07.436
I have got to ditch him.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.848
Okay, come on,
let's go talk to that Russian poet.

20:09.868 --> 20:11.226
That oughta shake him.

20:11.246 --> 20:13.119
Good idea.
(Regina laughs)

20:15.862 --> 20:18.237
(Bell rings)
(Men laughing)

20:18.708 --> 20:23.081
_

20:23.101 --> 20:26.370
It's so funny that you can hear it,
but I can't.

20:26.390 --> 20:27.812
(Phone buzzes)

20:33.086 --> 20:36.114
Uh, I have to, uh, make a call. I'll...

20:40.996 --> 20:42.751
Hey, it's you.

20:42.771 --> 20:45.245
I didn't think you were...

20:45.265 --> 20:46.481
sorry, um...

20:46.501 --> 20:48.940
Do you know who I am?

20:50.851 --> 20:52.961
I know, it's weird, right?

20:55.132 --> 20:57.967
Hi, uh, this is Bay Kennish.
I missed your call.

20:57.987 --> 21:00.006
Woman on phone: Yes, Dr. Larkin
would like you to come in tomorrow

21:00.026 --> 21:01.768
to discuss the results of your M.R.I.

21:01.788 --> 21:04.014
Um, okay.

21:04.034 --> 21:05.714
Can I talk to Dr. Larkin? Is he there?

21:05.734 --> 21:07.936
Oh, his office is closed,
but if you'd like his voicemail...

21:07.956 --> 21:09.814
No, no, um... I...

21:09.849 --> 21:11.993
I will be there at 8:40.

21:12.013 --> 21:13.627
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

21:19.856 --> 21:21.840
Hey, look I found him.

21:21.860 --> 21:24.477
_

21:24.497 --> 21:26.791
She probably just wants to
tell you how amazing you are

21:26.811 --> 21:28.814
and how she broke up with her boyfriend

21:28.834 --> 21:32.167
after she read all the things
that you wrote to Mandy

21:32.187 --> 21:35.356
because it finally showed
her what real love is.

21:35.376 --> 21:37.138
Does that help?

21:39.410 --> 21:40.638
(Sighs)

21:44.731 --> 21:46.585
_

21:46.605 --> 21:48.751
I'm sorry, I have to go.

21:49.049 --> 21:51.362
_

21:51.382 --> 21:53.529
I'm not jealous. I'm just...

21:53.549 --> 21:55.199
being realistic.

21:55.219 --> 21:57.520
_

21:57.842 --> 22:00.411
We don't know what's gonna happen.

22:00.431 --> 22:02.099
Your life is gonna change

22:02.133 --> 22:03.968
and who knows what's gonna happen to me.

22:03.988 --> 22:07.245
_

22:07.265 --> 22:11.298
_

22:11.744 --> 22:13.980
You're right, I am losing it,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.047
and I don't wanna drag you
into whatever is going on with me,

22:17.081 --> 22:19.983
so you should go to L.A. or D.C.

22:20.017 --> 22:21.885
and meet new people.

22:21.919 --> 22:23.489
I... no, I just can't...

22:23.509 --> 22:26.065
no, just... Let me go.

22:35.977 --> 22:37.775
There you are.

22:38.284 --> 22:39.785
I've been carrying this Chablis around.

22:39.805 --> 22:41.168
Well, I was just, you know...

22:41.188 --> 22:43.566
talking to my fellow authors and...

22:43.586 --> 22:46.420
- Right, guess you gotta work the room.
- Yeah.

22:46.440 --> 22:50.073
Well, when you're ready to shove off,
I was thinking we COD grab some dinner,

22:50.093 --> 22:53.678
maybe take the train
downtown for old time's sake.

22:54.088 --> 22:57.067
Just kidding.
(Nervous laughter)

22:57.749 --> 22:59.883
Unless you're up for it.

23:00.330 --> 23:02.907
Actually, I, um...

23:02.927 --> 23:05.786
I need to ask Regina.

23:06.978 --> 23:09.205
You look so tired, babe.

23:09.239 --> 23:11.160
Do you wanna go back to the hotel?

23:12.409 --> 23:14.429
We did book that couples massage.

23:14.449 --> 23:16.279
(Regina and Kathryn moaning)

23:16.313 --> 23:17.980
(Giggling)

23:18.147 --> 23:21.255
I guess I better tend
the home fires tonight.

23:21.275 --> 23:24.452
Wait, aren't you the other mom
from the first book?

23:24.713 --> 23:27.282
- I am.
- And you two...

23:28.200 --> 23:29.565
(Glasses clink)

23:30.194 --> 23:33.131
Oh, that's... modern.

23:33.899 --> 23:37.018
I think we both know how open-minded
Kathryn can be.

23:37.038 --> 23:39.376
So let's, um, get our coats.

23:39.396 --> 23:40.525
Okay.

23:42.201 --> 23:44.993
Definitely gave him
something to talk about.

23:46.308 --> 23:47.438
Lydia: Kathryn.

23:48.046 --> 23:49.545
Oh, um...

23:49.994 --> 23:52.527
We're just about to start the reading.

23:52.547 --> 23:54.724
I guess that massage will have to wait.

23:54.744 --> 23:57.412
- Knock 'em dead, hon.
- Thanks.

23:57.858 --> 23:59.844
Yeah, come on.

24:03.728 --> 24:05.565
(People chatting)

24:07.352 --> 24:08.844
You sure you don't want some?

24:08.864 --> 24:10.955
It's disgusting in the best way.

24:10.975 --> 24:12.901
Nope, I'm good.

24:12.921 --> 24:14.703
Well, I ate some crap and
I spent all my money.

24:14.737 --> 24:17.539
I think I'm done.
You want a ride home?

24:17.678 --> 24:19.433
(Straw gurgles)

24:19.453 --> 24:22.009
- No, I drove.
- I know.

24:22.029 --> 24:23.995
Maybe I should drive you home.

24:24.015 --> 24:26.638
Why is everyone such a drag?

24:26.658 --> 24:28.116
(Sighs)

24:28.904 --> 24:31.093
_

24:31.113 --> 24:34.004
Finally, somebody who wants to party.

24:39.670 --> 24:43.248
_

24:43.268 --> 24:45.147
_

24:45.167 --> 24:47.181
Come on, I'll go with you.

24:49.998 --> 24:51.181
I'll see you later.

24:51.201 --> 24:53.261
Try to have some fun.

24:56.185 --> 24:57.625
Have you seen Bay?

24:57.645 --> 24:59.970
_

25:04.822 --> 25:06.882
Bay. Bay!

25:06.902 --> 25:08.875
- Not up for it.
- It's about Daphne.

25:08.895 --> 25:11.134
Something's up with her.

25:11.568 --> 25:14.000
- Now what?
- She's been drinking a lot

25:14.020 --> 25:16.180
and she won't let me take her home,
so I just thought you could...

25:16.200 --> 25:18.103
- I don't know.
- Where is she?

25:18.123 --> 25:20.765
She just got on the
Ferris wheel with Travis.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.407
Thanks.

25:22.717 --> 25:24.120
"That night on the diamond,

25:24.140 --> 25:27.973
as 40,000 spectators watched him score,

25:28.007 --> 25:31.602
she felt the crowd's roar
breaking over like her a wave,

25:31.622 --> 25:35.880
carrying her up into the
night like burning sparks.

25:35.915 --> 25:37.453
She could not wait

25:37.473 --> 25:40.270
for another home run."

25:40.553 --> 25:42.487
(Applause)

25:42.765 --> 25:45.423
Thank you. Thank you.

25:48.494 --> 25:50.395
Train guy's still here.

26:04.833 --> 26:07.212
- Wow.
- Seriously, that was great.

26:07.246 --> 26:08.561
(Sighs)

26:08.581 --> 26:10.187
Not the kiss, the read.

26:10.207 --> 26:11.932
- You know what I mean.
- (Laughs) Yes.

26:12.825 --> 26:15.887
I feel like the girl who took her top off
at the dinner party.

26:15.921 --> 26:17.696
Great job.

26:17.716 --> 26:19.372
Oh, I loved it.

26:19.392 --> 26:22.536
And apparently, so did Andrea Askowitz.

26:22.556 --> 26:25.360
I just got word she wants to meet you.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.332
- Me?
- Yeah.

26:26.352 --> 26:29.249
- Why?
- Because you're awesome.

26:29.269 --> 26:31.495
You should probably go with her.

26:31.515 --> 26:33.741
There is a whole little buzz about you two,

26:33.761 --> 26:35.570
and I don't need to know what it is

26:35.590 --> 26:39.690
but just get over there
and stoke the mystery.

26:39.710 --> 26:40.912
Ah.

26:41.907 --> 26:44.165
(Carnival music playing)

26:47.156 --> 26:49.916
_

26:49.936 --> 26:52.194
_

26:52.214 --> 26:54.378
_

26:57.786 --> 26:59.759
_

26:59.779 --> 27:01.534
_

27:07.349 --> 27:10.352
_

27:11.456 --> 27:15.179
_

27:15.812 --> 27:18.639
_

27:18.659 --> 27:21.815
_

27:23.069 --> 27:25.203
_

27:25.389 --> 27:27.581
_

27:29.330 --> 27:32.085
_

27:32.718 --> 27:34.927
_

27:35.188 --> 27:38.307
_

27:41.223 --> 27:45.144
_

27:48.147 --> 27:49.831
Oh my God.

27:49.851 --> 27:51.519
Is she making out with Travis?

27:51.539 --> 27:54.385
I told you, she's out of control.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.530
_

27:58.550 --> 28:00.428
_

28:00.448 --> 28:03.183
_

28:06.835 --> 28:09.354
_

28:18.676 --> 28:21.385
Hey, what the hell was that?

28:21.762 --> 28:22.506
Back off.

28:22.541 --> 28:24.342
Mary Beth is my friend,

28:24.376 --> 28:25.842
so no, I'm not gonna back off.

28:25.862 --> 28:27.691
What, your thug wasn't enough for you?

28:27.711 --> 28:29.503
Yeah, that's not racist.

28:29.523 --> 28:31.575
And you using that guy like a prop

28:31.595 --> 28:34.251
to piss off Regina, that's not riseither?

28:34.271 --> 28:36.187
Look, this has nothing to do with you.

28:36.221 --> 28:37.221
Just stay out of it.

28:37.255 --> 28:38.975
You punishing my mother

28:38.995 --> 28:41.800
for my father dying has
nothing to do with me?

28:41.820 --> 28:44.701
- This is between me and Regina.
- No, it's not!

28:44.721 --> 28:45.963
We are all in this, okay?

28:45.998 --> 28:49.310
And we are all getting tired
of you lashing out at her.

28:49.330 --> 28:52.597
Sorry if I'm not getting
back to grill night fast enough for you.

28:52.617 --> 28:54.210
You know what, you are not the only one

28:54.230 --> 28:58.084
going through stuff,
so stop acting like a little brat.

29:04.404 --> 29:06.402
Exactly, exactly.

29:08.097 --> 29:09.596
Excuse me, Ms. Askowitz?

29:09.616 --> 29:11.266
- Uh-huh?
- I'm Kathryn Kennish

29:11.300 --> 29:13.943
and it is an honor to meet you.

29:13.963 --> 29:15.937
Oh, hello.

29:15.971 --> 29:18.212
Right, sit down, please.

29:18.232 --> 29:19.775
Go.

29:19.795 --> 29:21.111
(Whispers) I'm sorry.

29:24.190 --> 29:26.635
(Clears throat)
(Sighs heavily)

29:27.181 --> 29:29.369
Kathryn loved your
memoir about your mother.

29:29.389 --> 29:30.995
- Oh.
- Kathryn: "Battle Axe"

29:31.015 --> 29:32.993
was so smart and funny

29:33.013 --> 29:36.360
and so sadly relatable.

29:36.782 --> 29:38.263
I mean, not that your mom was sad...

29:38.283 --> 29:39.839
Trust me, she was sad.

29:39.859 --> 29:41.485
(Laughs)
(Nervous chuckles)

29:41.746 --> 29:44.992
Oh, I'm so sorry. This is Regina Vasquez.

29:45.489 --> 29:48.633
I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed
"Batter Up."

29:48.653 --> 29:49.800
- You read it?
- Mm-hmm.

29:49.820 --> 29:53.783
What I wanted to ask you is if I could
include it in my next syllabus.

29:53.803 --> 29:56.924
I do a seminar on Jane
Austen in popular context.

29:56.944 --> 29:59.220
Wait a second, did you just say Jane Austen

29:59.240 --> 30:01.479
and "Batter Up" in the same sentence?

30:01.499 --> 30:02.409
Mm-hmm, I think there's

30:02.429 --> 30:07.087
I think there's some really playful
parallels between regency England

30:07.107 --> 30:10.277
and all that encoded, gender-specific stuff

30:10.297 --> 30:12.250
that you write about in pro athletics.

30:12.270 --> 30:15.610
Plus your book's hot,
so the undergrads will actually read it.

30:15.630 --> 30:17.298
(Laughs)

30:19.098 --> 30:21.583
Thanks for coming all this way.

30:21.603 --> 30:23.090
It's okay.

30:23.110 --> 30:25.323
My aunt can come pick me up.

30:31.268 --> 30:32.830
You okay?

30:33.981 --> 30:35.747
How do you deal with it?

30:35.767 --> 30:39.184
With your mom and everything
she's done to you?

30:40.438 --> 30:44.662
I guess I just tell myself
she's not really my mom.

30:44.682 --> 30:47.206
My mom took care of me when I was little...

30:47.330 --> 30:49.863
threw me birthday parties,

30:49.897 --> 30:52.319
sang Lionel Ritchie to torture me.

30:55.336 --> 30:57.437
So you forgive her?

30:59.707 --> 31:02.809
It's more like I wait for her to come back.

31:08.298 --> 31:11.864
I don't know who my mom is anymore.
(Sobbing)

31:11.884 --> 31:14.138
Anyway, thanks for the ride.

31:17.489 --> 31:18.648
Hey.

31:18.668 --> 31:19.760
Here.

31:22.056 --> 31:24.034
I know you got a lot going on,

31:24.054 --> 31:27.216
but if you need something,
you let me know, okay?

31:28.296 --> 31:29.847
Yeah.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.329
I see you later.

31:41.527 --> 31:42.711
Score!

31:42.731 --> 31:45.089
- I made friends with the caterer.
- Ah-ha!

31:45.387 --> 31:47.184
You know what? This is crazy.
People are tweeting

31:47.204 --> 31:49.413
about my open marriage.

31:49.904 --> 31:54.091
Chris Washburn. What was I thinking?

31:54.265 --> 31:58.763
You know, um, I slept with Angelo
the first day I met him.

31:58.783 --> 32:00.376
But then again, who didn't?

32:00.396 --> 32:01.748
(Both laughing)

32:04.952 --> 32:06.886
(Laughing continues)

32:16.540 --> 32:17.971
(Sighs)

32:18.294 --> 32:20.726
That's the first time I've laughed since...

32:22.327 --> 32:23.895
You're allowed.

32:23.915 --> 32:25.479
(Breathes deeply)

32:25.499 --> 32:27.129
Thank you for this.

32:27.464 --> 32:28.951
I really needed it.

32:30.862 --> 32:32.773
You're gonna be okay.

32:32.793 --> 32:34.833
I don't think so.

32:34.853 --> 32:36.620
Daphne hates me.

32:36.640 --> 32:39.093
No, she doesn't.

32:39.113 --> 32:41.518
It's just easier for Daphne to blame you

32:41.538 --> 32:45.397
than to deal with how random
and cruel it was.

32:45.417 --> 32:47.652
Well, it sucks.

32:47.686 --> 32:49.542
Part of being a mom.

32:49.562 --> 32:50.922
You give 'em everything,

32:50.956 --> 32:53.711
they write a book about you called
"Battle Axe."

32:55.002 --> 32:57.893
I just wanna get back
to some kind of normal.

32:57.913 --> 33:00.398
And if it takes giving that money back...

33:00.433 --> 33:01.700
Whoa.

33:01.720 --> 33:04.671
That money is your ticket to independence.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.329
Pay off all your debts,

33:06.349 --> 33:09.307
put most of it away and then do something

33:09.341 --> 33:12.077
that makes you and Daphne happy.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.520
Yeah.

33:17.488 --> 33:20.143
Bay, thanks for coming in.

33:20.163 --> 33:22.187
Well, you know, possible mortality...

33:22.221 --> 33:23.634
thought I'd make time for it.

33:23.654 --> 33:25.156
I didn't mean to alarm you.

33:25.191 --> 33:28.308
I just find it best to go
over everything in person.

33:30.542 --> 33:31.741
So...

33:32.051 --> 33:33.098
So...

33:33.132 --> 33:35.270
Your M.R.I. came back negative.

33:35.290 --> 33:37.983
We found no presence of
aneurysms at this time.

33:38.003 --> 33:39.998
So I'm gonna be okay. That's it?

33:40.018 --> 33:42.044
You should just focus on living your life

33:42.064 --> 33:44.533
- and stay away from the Internet.
- (Laughs)

33:47.052 --> 33:49.671
I feel like you gave me my life back.

33:51.532 --> 33:53.105
Thank you.

33:53.125 --> 33:54.763
Take care.

34:02.379 --> 34:03.384
Hey.

34:03.404 --> 34:04.701
Hey!

34:04.735 --> 34:06.002
Welcome home.

34:06.036 --> 34:07.837
Oh, something smells good.

34:07.871 --> 34:09.672
Yeah, where's Regina?

34:09.706 --> 34:11.376
Uh, I think she went upstairs.

34:11.396 --> 34:13.643
Oh, I thought we'd all be
having Jambalaya together

34:13.677 --> 34:16.545
because according to
booklover69 on your website,

34:16.580 --> 34:19.891
that's pretty much all we do
around here all day long.

34:20.152 --> 34:22.409
- Make Jambalaya?
- I think it's a euphemism.

34:22.429 --> 34:25.621
What the...
heck were you doing out there?

34:25.656 --> 34:29.062
Ugh, it was just some crazy rumor
about Regina and I.

34:29.081 --> 34:32.428
I don't know how it started,
but Lydia said to go with it.

34:32.447 --> 34:34.574
I get it. Mm-hmm.

34:34.594 --> 34:36.844
Whatever it takes to get in the club,
right?

34:36.864 --> 34:39.004
Yeah, but, honey, here's the thing.

34:39.024 --> 34:42.054
I was in the club,
and not just 'cause of some crazy rumor

34:42.074 --> 34:43.655
but because of my book.

34:43.675 --> 34:46.371
Smart, fancy people actually liked it.

34:46.391 --> 34:48.010
Of course they did, I'm not surprised.

34:48.030 --> 34:52.511
Andrea Askowitz wants
to use it in her seminar on Jane Austen.

34:52.531 --> 34:53.813
Can you believe that?

34:53.833 --> 34:55.635
Wow.

34:56.206 --> 34:57.725
You don't know who she is.

34:57.745 --> 34:59.003
I've heard of Jane Austen.

34:59.023 --> 35:00.356
(Both chuckle)

35:00.376 --> 35:03.081
I just love the feeling.
I don't know, like...

35:03.101 --> 35:05.741
I wasn't... Just the cheerleader.

35:05.761 --> 35:08.376
Honey, you've always been more
than just the cheerleader.

35:08.396 --> 35:10.481
What are you talking about?

35:10.679 --> 35:15.507
I just deeply regret the fact that I've
never seen you in your uniform.

35:15.990 --> 35:17.039
Don't get any ideas.

35:17.074 --> 35:20.702
Oh, I hear you're open to
all kinds of new ideas.

35:21.508 --> 35:23.630
Oh my God.

35:24.673 --> 35:26.038
(Door closes)

35:27.341 --> 35:31.088
_

35:39.414 --> 35:44.278
_

35:44.961 --> 35:53.960
_

35:56.020 --> 36:02.297
_

36:02.496 --> 36:05.946
_

36:06.082 --> 36:07.646
_

36:11.109 --> 36:13.380
_

36:13.400 --> 36:16.036
_

36:22.570 --> 36:25.200
_

36:26.392 --> 36:30.375
_

36:32.832 --> 36:35.860
_

36:36.009 --> 36:37.845
_

36:37.865 --> 36:40.645
_

36:40.665 --> 36:43.380
_

36:43.400 --> 36:46.142
_

36:47.247 --> 36:48.959
_

36:49.369 --> 36:53.408
_

36:53.768 --> 36:56.163
_

36:56.299 --> 36:57.950
_

36:57.970 --> 36:59.538
_

36:59.558 --> 37:01.688
_

37:02.669 --> 37:04.530
_

37:05.622 --> 37:07.682
_

37:08.030 --> 37:10.102
_

37:14.501 --> 37:16.027
_

37:16.871 --> 37:18.472
_

37:27.782 --> 37:31.145
_

37:31.483 --> 37:34.213
_

37:35.752 --> 37:38.420
_

37:39.140 --> 37:42.069
_

38:14.677 --> 38:18.077
(Sighs) I'm sorry to bug you at work.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.433
_

38:21.336 --> 38:22.564
(Sighs)

38:25.468 --> 38:28.223
It's been a crazy time,

38:29.191 --> 38:31.879
but I think I got some...

38:32.437 --> 38:34.113
clarity.

38:34.758 --> 38:36.706
I love that sign.

38:39.176 --> 38:42.097
You should go to U.S.C.

38:42.117 --> 38:45.989
And I know that it's
expensive and far away, but...

38:47.078 --> 38:49.312
You have to go...

38:51.707 --> 38:54.288
and I should come with you.

38:56.521 --> 38:57.712
_

38:58.308 --> 39:01.882
My parents have been bugging me for a plan,

39:02.415 --> 39:04.984
now I have one... yours.

39:06.002 --> 39:08.136
_

39:09.539 --> 39:13.572
I wanna be with you and I don't wanna wait.

39:13.857 --> 39:16.493
You are gonna be an amazing filmmaker.

39:16.513 --> 39:19.331
And I am gonna be a...

39:20.013 --> 39:23.773
person with no idea what she wants to do.

39:37.053 --> 39:38.182
Hey.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.381
I, um, got you your favorite.

39:46.271 --> 39:48.256
Can I talk to you for a minute?

39:49.423 --> 39:51.452
I'm kinda busy.

39:54.011 --> 39:56.433
I thought about what you said,

39:56.453 --> 39:59.808
how you felt about Angelo's
insurance settlement,

39:59.828 --> 40:03.720
and I was thinking that maybe we could

40:03.754 --> 40:07.824
use some of it to help get Melody's
new program off the ground.

40:12.098 --> 40:13.853
What program?

40:13.873 --> 40:18.382
A new deaf studies department at U.M.K.C.

40:18.402 --> 40:20.189
Through Gallaudet.

40:20.209 --> 40:22.166
I didn't know about that.

40:23.928 --> 40:27.610
And we could name it after Angelo.

40:32.337 --> 40:34.322
That could be cool.

40:34.595 --> 40:37.268
And I was thinking that, you know,

40:37.288 --> 40:40.031
maybe we could go on a
road trip this summer...

40:40.403 --> 40:42.990
Grand Canyon, Las Vegas...

40:43.176 --> 40:44.661
anywhere you want.

40:44.695 --> 40:46.663
You, me and Bay, too.

40:46.697 --> 40:48.971
Or just us two.

40:50.051 --> 40:52.012
I don't think so.

40:52.198 --> 40:53.913
Why not?

40:53.933 --> 40:56.472
Just because you give money to Melody

40:56.507 --> 40:58.864
doesn't change things between us.

40:58.884 --> 41:00.969
Angelo is still dead.

41:01.168 --> 41:03.446
How much longer is this gonna go on?

41:03.480 --> 41:06.108
Because I'm not sure I can take it.

41:07.771 --> 41:10.386
You can't take it?

41:10.421 --> 41:11.965
Daphne...

41:12.238 --> 41:14.324
I did not kill Angelo.

41:14.358 --> 41:17.460
We had an argument. People argue.

41:17.985 --> 41:20.463
I was there. I know what you said.

41:20.497 --> 41:23.078
Do you honestly think I
wanted him to drive off

41:23.098 --> 41:24.834
and have an accident?

41:24.854 --> 41:27.118
I am suffering just as much as you are.

41:27.138 --> 41:28.602
Are you?

41:28.622 --> 41:33.485
Because all I see is you working
with Chip Coto and lying to me

41:33.505 --> 41:35.180
and taking all of this money.

41:35.200 --> 41:38.342
- How did I lie to you?
- You've always lied to me...

41:38.377 --> 41:41.026
ever since you found out about the switch
and didn't tell me.

41:41.046 --> 41:44.068
Oh my God, are we back to this again?

41:44.738 --> 41:47.125
You know what? No, it's good,

41:47.145 --> 41:51.253
because finally I can see
you for who you really are.

41:52.432 --> 41:53.876
You're not my mother.

41:53.896 --> 41:57.538
You have never been my mother.

41:57.558 --> 41:59.047
(Crying)
