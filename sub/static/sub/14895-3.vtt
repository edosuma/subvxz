[crowd cheering]

00:11.302 --> 00:13.096
[indistinct chanting]

00:16.224 --> 00:19.060
[Buddy] <i>Some of you young assholes</i>
<i>did not prepare.</i>

00:20.061 --> 00:22.522
They wanted it more than y'all did!

00:22.605 --> 00:25.859
We had chances to win this game.
It should've never come down to this.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.944
That one's gone, all right?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.487
You had that here.

00:29.571 --> 00:33.241
Now that one, wad it up, throw it away,
it don't matter no more.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.910
The streak's over.
All that shit's over.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.913
It's over.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.041
Now, we gotta get ready for the next one.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.876
We gotta prepare.
Our Father...

00:42.959 --> 00:44.627
[players] Who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.046
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.340
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

01:39.224 --> 01:42.227
Just trying to straighten little things
up around here on my day off.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.982
<i>Co-Lin's got a good team.</i>

01:48.066 --> 01:51.027
<i>Maybe this is a little</i>
<i>wake-up call for 'em.</i>

01:51.111 --> 01:54.864
<i>In my honest opinion,</i>
<i>I do believe our coaches</i>

01:54.948 --> 01:56.699
<i>and as smart</i>
<i>as our coaching staffs are...</i>

01:57.951 --> 02:00.120
I do believe you'll see
a lot of adjustments.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.126
[Buddy] It's been, what,
two years since we lost a game?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.711
{\an8}-Dang near three.
-Huh?

02:08.794 --> 02:10.255
{\an8}2012.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.636
Yeah, I forgot what that feels like.
It sucks.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.012
[chuckles] Yeah.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.105
{\an8}As a realistic person...

02:27.772 --> 02:30.316
{\an8}you know it's, it's... it's coming.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.569
You know,
no streak is gonna last forever.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.697
<i>Defensively, I didn't think</i>
<i>we deserved to win that game.</i>

02:35.780 --> 02:38.491
<i>We didn't play well enough.</i>
<i>Those things happen.</i>

02:38.575 --> 02:40.535
<i>Nobody cares what happens to you.</i>

02:40.618 --> 02:43.663
What they care about is how you...
how you handle it.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.999
And so, that'll be...

02:46.082 --> 02:48.585
At the end, that'll be the telltale
of whether this team

02:48.668 --> 02:50.920
was one of the great ones, or, or not...

02:51.004 --> 02:52.839
in my opinion, so...

02:58.887 --> 03:03.099
Losing magnifies things twenty-fold.

03:03.182 --> 03:07.645
This season didn't end last night.
This season just started.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.315
The things you're gonna learn
about this team

03:10.398 --> 03:12.066
are gonna come out this week.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.569
You're gonna--
I'm gonna learn what you're made of.

03:14.652 --> 03:17.030
I told those coaches,
"I don't want a single player

03:17.113 --> 03:18.948
not contributing
this coming Thursday."

03:19.032 --> 03:20.742
Every one of you
better get your ass ready to play.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.368
-You understand?
-[players] Yes, sir.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.288
You put this team first,
no matter what you do.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.541
Behind God and family,
it's this team now.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.628
Because that's the only way
we're gonna win.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.216
[indistinct chatter]

03:41.137 --> 03:43.640
We took an "L" right under the chin.

03:44.557 --> 03:45.725
Right in those teeth, bro.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.685
Right in those teeth.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.854
Look how many plays I played outta 88.

03:51.064 --> 03:55.026
Sixty-four. Out of 88 plays,
I played 64.

03:55.109 --> 03:58.238
Bro, I'm a defensive tackle, bro.
You know how tough that was?

03:58.321 --> 04:00.281
[chuckles softly] I played 88 plays.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.367
-You played the whole 88?
-I played the whole 88.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.286
I didn't come off not one time.
And I did special teams.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.663
[both laughing]

04:06.746 --> 04:07.872
God. God.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.291
They wasn't even that good.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.460
We got flexed.
We got flexed too, though.

04:12.543 --> 04:15.964
I'll tell you what, though.
From now on, I'm playin' angry, bro.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.675
I'm about to really start snappin', bro.
Like, this junk got me hot.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.385
I'm about to really
start snappin' in games, bro.

04:20.468 --> 04:21.844
What? Ah! But listen--

04:21.928 --> 04:24.097
-No, for real, bro.
-Man, I ain't lost in forever, bro.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.640
Practice too, bro.
I'm about to start snappin'.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.350
Yeah, practice too.
I said that in practice.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.479
[Wyatt] <i>Yeah, I mean, you know,</i>
<i>that's... that's the first loss</i>

04:31.562 --> 04:33.064
<i>I've had since we've been here.</i>

04:33.147 --> 04:36.150
{\an8}And I think it's the first loss
since 2012 maybe.

04:36.234 --> 04:39.779
{\an8}So, uh, definitely something...
Definitely a feeling you don't like.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.491
<i>There's always things you go back</i>
<i>and wish you'd done different</i>

04:43.574 --> 04:45.076
<i>but once it's done, it's done.</i>

04:45.159 --> 04:47.203
<i>So, uh, I guess last time</i>
<i>they lost a game,</i>

04:47.287 --> 04:49.497
they rattled off 25 in a row,
so, maybe...

04:49.580 --> 04:51.874
maybe that's a sign of
what we can do this time, you know.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.837
So, gotta just look positive
and work to get better.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.299
[Trickett] You're gonna have all the
throws you think you're gonna have,

04:59.382 --> 05:01.634
{\an8}um, if you go through
our regular progression.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.928
{\an8}This is just 94, right here.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.723
{\an8}I don't know, it's exactly what it is.
You have your Out.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.641
{\an8}-Okay.
-And you have your Dig.

05:09.892 --> 05:12.186
{\an8}[John] <i>That game, I was real hype.</i>

05:12.312 --> 05:15.064
{\an8}The second play of the game,
I... I, uh, it was a low snap,

05:15.148 --> 05:18.901
<i>and I tried to make a positive play</i>
<i>out of it, it ended up costin' us.</i>

05:18.985 --> 05:20.570
<i>And I fumbled the ball.</i>

05:20.653 --> 05:22.905
<i>And I knew it was just 'cause</i>
<i>my adrenaline was going.</i>

05:22.989 --> 05:25.408
And then it was, you know...

05:25.491 --> 05:29.162
Coaches decided to go with Wyatt,
so we just had to, you know...

05:29.245 --> 05:31.497
do what I had to do, you know,
support him and...

05:31.581 --> 05:32.999
<i>kept moving.</i>

06:13.331 --> 06:15.833
[Wood] We did miss some reads,
there's no question about it.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.794
We missed some balls
we shouldn't have missed.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.797
I mean, it was a, it was a group effort.
We're gonna be fine.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.465
We're going to be fine.

06:22.548 --> 06:23.800
We just gotta go to work.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.927
I think Wyatt's right on what he said.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.179
He should have probably
went the other way.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.722
No question, but...

06:29.806 --> 06:32.266
[Buddy] But we don't have time
for a quarterback to grow up.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.851
You know, we just don't.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.269
[Wood] He played well.

06:35.353 --> 06:38.356
I mean he threw for 337,
he ran the ball and kept out of sacks,

06:38.439 --> 06:40.900
he avoided a lot of pressure.
I mean, he did a good job.

06:40.983 --> 06:43.861
[Buddy] It's easier... it's easy for us
to look at it on film and go,

06:43.945 --> 06:46.030
-"Hey, he should've thrown it here."
-[Wood] Sure. But--

06:46.114 --> 06:48.199
I ain't the one who got
the big guys trying to hit me.

06:48.282 --> 06:49.450
[Wood] No, no doubt.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.120
[Buddy] All right. That's it.
See y'all out there on the field.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.579
[player grunts]

06:53.663 --> 06:56.124
[coach] Hey, hey, hey,
all right there, corner!

06:56.207 --> 06:57.792
-The fuck are you doing?
-[blows whistle]

06:57.875 --> 07:01.212
[Wood] Hey, Rea.
Don't stop on an in-cut route.

07:01.295 --> 07:02.505
[Buddy] Hey!

07:02.588 --> 07:04.006
Hey, let me ask you somethin'.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.550
Let me ask you somethin'.
Hey, hey, hold on a second.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.844
Hold on a damn second.
Y'all bring y'all's ass over here.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.888
Do you think for one fucking minute
that the damn guard from Northeast

07:10.972 --> 07:13.391
is gonna come around here
and stop and do this shit?

07:13.474 --> 07:14.725
Do you think he is?

07:14.809 --> 07:18.104
The one thing that this group right here,
this side and this side,

07:18.187 --> 07:20.314
if we run the ball and protect the passer,

07:20.398 --> 07:22.900
stop the run and rush the passer,
we can beat anybody we play.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.735
But God damn it, we won't do it.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.905
'Cause you'll half-ass it.
You will half-ass it.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.031
Don't half-ass it!

07:29.115 --> 07:31.242
Get your ass in line, get down and run!

07:31.325 --> 07:32.660
Don't half-ass it!

07:33.744 --> 07:36.497
Run it again.
Run it again. Hey!

07:36.581 --> 07:39.208
I can't coach both sides
of the goddamn ball.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.835
Get down and run it again!

07:40.918 --> 07:42.795
Do it perfect!
You got to!

07:42.879 --> 07:44.839
We ain't that goddamn talented!

07:58.561 --> 08:00.605
[Marcel] How can we get better?

08:02.190 --> 08:05.067
-As a team?
-As a unit. As a D-line.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.153
[Ollie sniffs]

08:08.196 --> 08:11.741
I mean, when it's just us,
I'm like, "Fuck everybody else, bro."

08:13.159 --> 08:16.370
Fuck them. You know what I'm saying?
We gotta focus on us.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.374
We won't care what the DB's doing,
linebackers do.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.543
We gotta go hard though.

08:24.837 --> 08:28.132
[Penick] All right.
So, when you are writing an essay--

08:28.216 --> 08:30.968
[Ollie] Are we asking...
We just telling...

08:31.052 --> 08:33.304
like, telling facts in the paragraph?

08:33.386 --> 08:35.014
-You're proving.
-Yeah.

08:35.097 --> 08:39.519
You're proving whatever you say
is going on in the paper.

08:39.602 --> 08:43.856
So, if you're saying that there is, um...

08:43.940 --> 08:47.652
man versus nature conflict
in <i>The Most Dangerous Game,</i>

08:47.735 --> 08:53.699
{\an8}you gotta prove to me that
there are at least three examples of that

08:53.783 --> 08:55.618
from the story.

08:55.701 --> 08:59.080
[Wagner] <i>DJ Law, DeMario Lanier,</i>
<i>Desmond Goss,</i>

08:59.163 --> 09:00.665
<i>and Demetrius Gleaton</i>

09:00.748 --> 09:02.875
<i>still have not turned</i>
<i>their paper in for English.</i>

09:02.959 --> 09:05.378
If they don't have it turned in
by 3:00, it's a zero.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.630
And I've call--
I called all of them this morning

09:07.713 --> 09:11.842
at, like, 7:45,
because it was supposed to be due at 9:30,

09:11.926 --> 09:14.220
and I sent all of them a text at 7:45,

09:14.303 --> 09:17.181
reminding them to turn it in by 9:30.
None of them did.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.518
I have sent them all texts
and called all of them now

09:20.601 --> 09:22.103
and no one will answer their phone.

09:22.186 --> 09:25.231
'Cause-- Okay.
All right, thanks. Bye.

09:26.315 --> 09:29.235
<i>The main thing for me after kind of...</i>

09:29.318 --> 09:32.113
the shock of us just losing, like, yes,

09:32.196 --> 09:35.283
I have that moment where,
in my brain, I'm thinking...

09:37.034 --> 09:39.495
"Okay, how...
Like, how're we gonna react?"

09:39.579 --> 09:42.373
[Wagner] Y'all have had how many days?

09:42.456 --> 09:45.334
It was due Thursday,
you didn't do it then.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.004
Then it was due this morning,
and you didn't do it then.

09:48.087 --> 09:52.091
Nobody's answering my text,
nobody's answering the phone when I call,

09:52.174 --> 09:53.759
everybody's totally avoiding it.

09:53.843 --> 09:57.555
So we're all going down to the tutor
and we're about to finish this paper.

09:57.638 --> 10:00.891
Like, are they gonna care
about academics anymore,

10:00.975 --> 10:02.852
<i>you know, or are they just</i>
<i>gonna quit everything?</i>

10:02.935 --> 10:05.896
<i>Because that's all they wanna do,</i>
<i>is play for that National Championship</i>

10:05.980 --> 10:08.316
<i>and so, when that's off the table,</i>

10:08.399 --> 10:10.901
<i>I mean, are they just gonna go home</i>
<i>and then that's it?</i>

10:10.985 --> 10:12.445
<i>Like, they're done.</i>

10:12.528 --> 10:17.199
I really haven't had to face that
because we've never... lost.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.494
And none of them have done anything.
They have nothing.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.038
-This way?
-Yes.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.756
Hey.

10:31.839 --> 10:34.759
She says something, there's not a word
to be said back to her, all right?

10:34.842 --> 10:37.094
Just shut up and do
what she tells you to do.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.721
Okay? You got me?

10:38.804 --> 10:41.223
-[DJ] Who, me? You're telling me?
-All four of y'all.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.683
I'm talking to all of y'all.

10:42.767 --> 10:46.395
Listen to me.
I've done a lot for you, okay?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.731
[Mario] <i>You gotta deal with the coach...</i>
[chuckles]

10:48.814 --> 10:50.232
<i>you gotta deal with Miss Wagner.</i>

10:50.775 --> 10:55.988
{\an8}The curfew, the 7:00 wake-up
for breakfast, and...

10:56.656 --> 10:58.282
{\an8}All that just...

10:59.325 --> 11:01.327
on your mind, then you gotta practice.

11:01.410 --> 11:05.331
<i>But, as in a classroom,</i>
<i>you gotta get it...</i>

11:06.165 --> 11:09.126
to leave here and go to another level.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.006
[DJ] Hey, what's three things y'all
want to do before y'all die?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.508
[Mario] Get money.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.343
-[player] Get out of Mississippi.
-[chuckles]

11:18.302 --> 11:20.429
Get out of Scooba Tech.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.556
I need some ideas.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.226
You know, school,
school really isn't my thing

11:25.309 --> 11:29.355
but it's... it's something you gotta do
to get where, like, where I wanna be.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.982
But on the football field, it's easy.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.860
It's... I don't know,
it's just natural. It comes to me.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.195
[typing]

11:41.659 --> 11:43.411
Very good.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.538
It's very good. See?

11:45.621 --> 11:47.957
-[chuckles]
-Like, I don't understand, DJ.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.044
You can do this.
Like, this is good.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.214
-Why do you stress yourself out?
-I don't know.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.841
I don't either, like I...

11:56.924 --> 11:59.093
If you couldn't do it
and you got in here and, like,

11:59.176 --> 12:02.138
you literally couldn't put a sentence
together then I would halfway be like,

12:02.221 --> 12:04.974
"Okay, he didn't do it because he can't."

12:05.057 --> 12:07.059
You know, like, I get that.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.355
-All right.
-You can totally do this. This is...

12:11.439 --> 12:14.442
[whispers] This is the best one
of all those guys.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.652
[chuckles] All right, Miss Wagner.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.195
[typing]

12:18.279 --> 12:20.030
[Buddy] <i>The ultimate goal</i>
<i>is our graduation rate.</i>

12:20.114 --> 12:22.950
The ultimate goal is getting these guys
to understand that...

12:23.033 --> 12:24.368
[stutters] it doesn't surround football.

12:24.452 --> 12:28.372
{\an8}Football is a, is a... is a tool
that we use to pay for education.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.000
We lost last week.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.919
Uh, you know, I woke up the next day,

12:34.003 --> 12:36.839
I was surprised the dog was wagging
its tail and wanted to lick me.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.258
-Uh, I was surprised that, uh...
-[audience chuckling]

12:39.341 --> 12:41.260
I was surprised
that my wife was just there.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.804
Uh, very somber.
Everybody that saw me,

12:43.888 --> 12:46.348
"I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry."

12:46.432 --> 12:49.768
I was like, "Nobody died,
we lost a ball game. All right?

12:49.852 --> 12:52.897
And we lost a ball game 'cause we
didn't prepare, we didn't prepare well."

12:52.980 --> 12:55.107
And, uh, if we can do that in practice,

12:55.191 --> 12:57.860
if we do it in the classroom,
if we do it around campus,

12:57.943 --> 12:59.487
we're gonna be fine.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.698
Uh, on the football side, um, you know,

13:02.781 --> 13:04.950
[stutters] I really don't know.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.703
I really don't know much
to say other than, you know,

13:07.786 --> 13:10.414
when the...
the body got together one day

13:10.498 --> 13:15.044
and the body decided they needed
to name a head coach, all right?

13:15.127 --> 13:17.922
And the brain spoke up and said,
"Hey, I'm the...

13:18.005 --> 13:21.926
I wanna be the head coach.
You know, I control everything."

13:22.009 --> 13:23.677
And then, you know,
the heart spoke up, said,

13:23.761 --> 13:25.679
"No. I'm the one that controls it.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.681
I pump the blood.
I make it work."

13:27.765 --> 13:29.808
You know, and then
the hands spoke up, said,

13:29.892 --> 13:32.102
"No. Without me,
you can't get anything done.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.063
I'm the worker,
I'm the... I'm the guy working."

13:34.146 --> 13:36.607
And the feet spoke up, said,
"But I take you everywhere.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.651
I take you everywhere."

13:38.734 --> 13:42.530
And... [sighs]
pardon, but the little asshole spoke up.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.614
[audience chuckles]

13:43.697 --> 13:45.324
He said,
"I wanna be head coach."

13:46.325 --> 13:48.953
All the other ones,
they started laughing and giggling,

13:49.036 --> 13:51.872
and he got his feelings hurt
and he shut down.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.457
Shut down for a couple of days.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.209
Two or three days
and then, all of a sudden, the brain,

13:55.292 --> 13:57.711
he couldn't think,
the heart was pumping real fast,

13:57.795 --> 14:00.965
the hands were shaking,
and the feet wouldn't go nowhere.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.092
So that just proves...
it goes to prove that

14:03.175 --> 14:05.010
you don't have to have a brain
to be a head coach

14:05.094 --> 14:06.554
-you just have to be an asshole.
-[audience laughing]

14:06.637 --> 14:08.889
Thank you for allowing me
to be here. It's been a pleasure.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.140
-Thank you.
-[audience applauding]

14:10.224 --> 14:12.184
-[man] Great job.
-Thank you.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.573
[Buddy's wife] Hi.
Yeah, put 'em over there.

14:26.615 --> 14:28.242
[interviewer] I take it
there's a different Buddy at home

14:28.325 --> 14:29.827
than there is on the sideline.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.289
[smacks lips]
Yes, absolutely. [chuckles]

14:33.372 --> 14:35.165
What?

14:35.249 --> 14:37.835
[Julianna] We're talking about you.
It's all bad. Just go back outside.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.045
[Buddy] I'm gonna change shirts,
mine smells smoky.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.422
[man] Smoky!

14:44.425 --> 14:47.887
{\an8}[Lauren] <i>I think it's always been a part</i>
<i>of our life, as long as I can remember.</i>

14:47.970 --> 14:50.180
{\an8}-I could care less about it but...
-[chuckles]

14:50.264 --> 14:51.682
{\an8}-We support our dad.
-Yeah.

14:51.765 --> 14:54.518
{\an8}-We support our dad all the way.
-Yeah, but other than that, like...

14:54.602 --> 14:57.104
[Buddy's wife] I should've made a salad
or something to go with this.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.023
[Buddy] No, they got steak and chips.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.691
[stutters] They're good.
I bet you--

15:00.774 --> 15:02.526
[Julianna] A well-balanced meal.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.528
[Lauren] <i>He's well-known around campus.</i>

15:04.612 --> 15:06.322
<i>Like last week,</i>
<i>I mentioned that he was my dad</i>

15:06.405 --> 15:08.282
<i>and a guy at my apartment, he was like,</i>

15:08.365 --> 15:12.453
"Whoa! That's a bad dude."
I'm like, "Yeah, he's my dad."

15:12.536 --> 15:14.496
[Rebekah] <i>We'll hear it</i>
<i>a lot from teachers, like,</i>

15:14.580 --> 15:16.707
<i>"Oh, you should hang out with her</i>

15:16.790 --> 15:19.460
'cause she can get you
into a football scholarship."

15:19.543 --> 15:21.545
Or "Don't mess with her,
her dad'll kill you."

15:21.629 --> 15:23.088
-[chuckles]
-Yeah.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.798
-He's a big old teddy bear.
-[chuckles]

15:24.882 --> 15:26.133
-[Rebekah] Yeah.
-[laughs]

15:26.216 --> 15:28.677
[Julianna] <i>He seems scary</i>
<i>on the outside, but then...</i>

15:28.761 --> 15:31.847
<i>when you call him Daddy, he's soft.</i>

15:31.931 --> 15:33.724
[Buddy] How do you like
our doll collection?

15:33.807 --> 15:34.892
At night, they come alive.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.101
[Buddy's wife] Please don't
videotape that.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.020
[Buddy] At night, they come alive.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.813
[Julianna] <i>Dad used to make us hold hands.</i>

15:39.897 --> 15:42.024
-I was just about to say that.
-After we would get into a fight,

15:42.107 --> 15:43.275
he would make us hold hands

15:43.359 --> 15:46.153
and, like, until we would, like,
start laughing and...

15:46.236 --> 15:48.614
Yeah, "You look out this window
and you look out here."

15:48.697 --> 15:50.991
-But still hold hands, so...
-[chuckling]

15:51.075 --> 15:53.661
[Buddy's wife] Buddy, you need
to take your medicine.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.412
Yeah, I know.

16:01.335 --> 16:05.255
[Lauren] <i>He's probably one of the most</i>
<i>generous people you're gonna meet</i>

16:05.339 --> 16:08.801
<i>and he's made an effort</i>
<i>to impact young men's lives.</i>

16:08.884 --> 16:11.261
He's our dad but he's also a dad to...

16:11.929 --> 16:14.807
60-something football players or more.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.100
[Buddy] Shit!

16:16.183 --> 16:18.060
Come off the ball!
Hey, hey! Hey!

16:18.143 --> 16:21.689
Get... No, no, no! Hell no!
You get your ass in there and you go.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.024
Full damn speed!
If you don't come off the damn ball,

16:24.108 --> 16:26.276
we're going to stay here
and practice all damn day.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.987
We won't leave this damn drill.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.156
Let's go! Get down!
Do the same thing!

16:32.408 --> 16:33.867
[Ollie] <i>Listen. Win, lose, or draw,</i>

16:33.951 --> 16:35.828
next year I'm entering the draft.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.205
You hear me?

16:39.498 --> 16:43.085
-Miss Wag... Miss Wagner?
-I would rather you get a degree.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.838
-I'mma get a degree.
-Well, not in one year.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.924
I'm talking about... I'mma go back
to school when I be in the league.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.385
Okay, you promise?

16:51.468 --> 16:53.345
[stutters] I'm dead serious.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.723
-Say "I promise."
-Come on now, Miss Wagner.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.182
Say "I promise." [chuckles]

16:57.266 --> 16:58.809
-You really...
-Ollie.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.769
-I promise.
-Thank you.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.354
[Ollie] Bro, I'm tired of school.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.772
Yo, when I start getting paid.
I'm... Ooh.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.608
Listen, I just wanna live, bro.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.901
I just be living.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.194
I can die...
I can die in about 20 minutes,

17:10.279 --> 17:12.071
-probably five minutes.
-Stop!

17:12.156 --> 17:14.032
I'm serious.
People don't be thinking like that

17:14.116 --> 17:15.659
-but I be thinking like that.
-Shh!

17:15.742 --> 17:17.536
-I can die at any second.
-Let's change our thoughts.

17:17.618 --> 17:20.830
-Let's think, like, positive, like...
-I can die at any time.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.665
-...good...
-I try to enjoy it.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.501
...productive thoughts.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.587
-I can't, bro.
-How we can be better.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.631
-Can't be better if you dead.
-Better people...

17:29.715 --> 17:31.800
[Ollie] It don't work like that.
[Wagner] ...better teammates,

17:31.884 --> 17:33.135
-better students.
-[Ollie] See, I live...

17:33.218 --> 17:35.512
I live in the real world,
I live in reality,

17:35.596 --> 17:38.182
'cause I know I can die
at, like, any minute.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.604
Miss Wagner, I thought we weren't
gonna never get along.

17:43.687 --> 17:45.105
I know. Me too.

17:45.522 --> 17:48.150
I really-- I really did hate you.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.070
I ain't hate you.
Well, I hated you.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.113
You hated me.
It's okay.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.075
Yeah. I didn't think I hated you,
but I... I just hate...

17:57.076 --> 17:58.869
It's okay that you hated me.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.996
-You don't hate me anymore.
-Yeah.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.917
[both chuckle]

18:06.043 --> 18:07.127
[Buddy] <i>Let's go!</i>
[coach] <i>Set.</i>

18:07.211 --> 18:09.755
[player] Hut. Set.
[coach] Drive. Go.

18:09.838 --> 18:10.881
[whistle blows]

18:10.964 --> 18:12.800
[Buddy] I would be happy
if we'd be violent.

18:12.883 --> 18:16.178
We are leaning way too much,
offensively and defensively.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.180
[Buddy] <i>We're a talented football team.</i>

18:18.263 --> 18:20.432
<i>I don't think there's anybody</i>
<i>that has more talent in the state.</i>

18:20.516 --> 18:24.394
<i>We just have to play faster, and...</i>
<i>and meaner, and tougher,</i>

18:24.478 --> 18:29.483
and you don't want... you don't want
it to slip away with a loss.

18:29.566 --> 18:30.692
[player] Ready, set!

18:33.028 --> 18:34.071
[whistle blows]

18:34.154 --> 18:35.572
[Wood] Here we go, here we go,
here we go.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.407
[Buddy] <i>Right now,</i>
<i>the chances of us playing</i>

18:37.491 --> 18:39.660
<i>for a National Championship,</i>
<i>not real good.</i>

18:39.743 --> 18:41.995
<i>You know, unless there is...</i>
<i>unless a lot of people get beat.</i>

18:42.079 --> 18:43.247
<i>But there is a chance.</i>

18:43.330 --> 18:46.083
But all we can control, and then
what I try to get over to them,

18:46.166 --> 18:50.420
all we can control
is what we do to get prepared, you know?

18:50.504 --> 18:52.297
Be better at what we do.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.300
Get down, get down, get down. Ready.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.220
Set, hit! Set inside, inside...
Oh, no. Why you setting?

18:58.303 --> 19:01.014
Get down.
Y'all playing bad today, boys.

19:01.098 --> 19:04.643
<i>Defensive line,</i>
<i>more violent, more violent.</i>

19:04.726 --> 19:07.062
<i>Offensive line, more violent!</i>

19:07.187 --> 19:09.982
<i>More violent.</i>
<i>Be violent!</i>

19:32.880 --> 19:33.881
[whistle blows]

19:33.964 --> 19:35.507
Gonna be a different me from now on, guys.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.925
Get used to it.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.179
I ain't gotta be your fuckin' friend.
All I gotta do is coach you.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.764
You do it and we win games, that's fine.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.349
Square your ass up in your stance.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.643
I ain't never tell you to copy
no damn stance.

19:46.727 --> 19:50.606
Fuck, you do what you supposed to do!
Stop fucking walking!

19:50.689 --> 19:53.025
The time for "my bad" is over, son.

19:53.108 --> 19:55.027
I don't give a...
That's no excuse!

19:56.278 --> 19:58.822
I'm tired of
"I didn't get to fucking play."

19:58.906 --> 20:00.282
Or "my bad."

20:00.365 --> 20:01.700
Get out... get out, go Lester.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.161
It's my bad for putting
your fucking ass on the field.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.595
-[whistle blows]
-[coach] Run over his ass.

20:21.678 --> 20:24.431
You do your drill right,
you ain't hit him that hard.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.353
Set, hit! Move, move, move,
right there, hands up.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.731
Hands. Move. Good. Run.
Drive him, drive him, drive him, good.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.319
[Bontrager] Who'd you hit?

20:39.238 --> 20:41.365
[Wood] Y'all keep going, keep going!

20:41.448 --> 20:42.824
[indistinct chatter]

20:48.330 --> 20:49.873
{\an8}How do you feel right now?

20:50.874 --> 20:52.167
I've got a headache.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.087
All right. What else?
Tell me everything you feel.

20:56.463 --> 20:57.631
[Ollie groans]

20:59.216 --> 21:01.927
I just can't keep my eyes open.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.303
Does the light bother you?

21:03.387 --> 21:04.638
Yeah, man.

21:04.721 --> 21:07.557
All right, on a scale of zero to six,
rate your headache.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.606
[Buddy] All right, Coach,
we ready when you are.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.733
[coach] Ready, baby. Let's go.
Let's go, guys. Let's go, guys!

21:16.817 --> 21:18.902
Come on, I ain't got a headache.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.696
You don't have a headache right now?

21:20.779 --> 21:23.365
Uh-uh, I gotta go practice.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.827
I'm all right.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.039
[coach] Go, go, jog it over,
get over there.

21:32.499 --> 21:33.834
All right.

21:35.419 --> 21:36.920
[Ollie] Yeah.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.422
[Bontrager] All right.
[sighs]

21:39.339 --> 21:40.340
Am I good?

21:40.424 --> 21:42.134
Nope. Just sit there.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.553
Oh, my gosh.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.348
[Buddy] Hey, hey, hey.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.060
[Buddy] <i>We're not good enough.</i>

21:52.144 --> 21:55.439
You gotta get off your ass
and damn rush the passer.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.607
Now, damn it, be violent with your hands!

22:18.003 --> 22:19.171
[Wagner] <i>Hi.</i>

22:19.254 --> 22:21.340
What's my name?

22:21.423 --> 22:23.175
-What's my name?
-[player chuckles]

22:23.258 --> 22:24.968
-Miss Wagner.
-Okay.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.636
-What happenin'?
-[Wagner] Just checking.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.056
[Wagner] You okay?
I heard you got hurt yesterday.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.849
[Ollie] Nah, we were doing
a tackling drill, man.

22:30.932 --> 22:33.185
Goddamn Coach Turno
makin' us go full speed.

22:33.268 --> 22:37.272
Now, I was tacklin' him with my facemask,
like, and I hit his ass hard.

22:38.398 --> 22:41.318
And I just...
After I hit him, I just fell, bro.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.695
When you woke up
you didn't know what year it was.

22:43.779 --> 22:44.780
Who said that?

22:44.863 --> 22:47.616
I'm just saying.
I was there in spirit, flying around.

22:48.575 --> 22:52.370
Nah, I thought I was seeing stars
though for a little bit, I swear to God.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.581
So you seen me when you opened your eyes.

22:54.664 --> 22:56.333
-[Ollie chuckles] Shut up.
-[all laughing]

22:56.416 --> 22:58.919
[James] When you wake up in Scooba,
what are your first thoughts?

22:59.002 --> 23:00.670
-[player] Uncut.
-[James] Your first thoughts

23:00.754 --> 23:02.255
when you wake up in Scooba?

23:02.339 --> 23:04.591
Why the fuck I come here?

23:04.674 --> 23:06.510
[James] I told you.
[Wagner] Ollie, that's not true.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.762
[James] I wake up here I'm stretching,

23:08.845 --> 23:11.098
-just sit there and look at the wall...
-[player] It's like damn...

23:11.181 --> 23:12.933
Like why the hell am I here, bro?

23:13.016 --> 23:15.811
-Like I'm finna' give up on football, man.
-[Ollie] I swear I be thinking that.

23:15.936 --> 23:19.564
{\an8}And just go and be a garbage man
and make, like, a band or two a week,

23:19.648 --> 23:21.733
{\an8}and eventually work my way to about 12.

23:21.817 --> 23:24.319
[Wagner] A garbage man
is not making a band or two a week.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.947
A garbage man is making a band
or two a month.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.698
-Maybe.
-Hold up, man, I'm saying what you got--

23:28.782 --> 23:29.825
You gotta work your way up.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.409
When you work your way up, man, you good.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.411
[Wagner] I'm not making
a band or two a week.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.622
-[Ollie] You ain't?
-No, Ollie.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.626
What do y'all... Y'all need to get
realistic about paychecks.

23:39.709 --> 23:40.961
[player] Hey, now, I always say, hey,

23:41.044 --> 23:43.338
if I get to that point in my life
where it's too bad...

23:43.421 --> 23:45.048
Man, them rings? Sold.

23:45.132 --> 23:47.509
[Ollie] Yeah, I'm gonna sell my rings.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.386
If I ever get down bad...

23:49.469 --> 23:51.179
Oh, yeah, them rings gone.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.472
[laughing]

23:59.479 --> 24:03.358
[Buddy] I'll deal with it.
We'll play without him this week.

24:03.441 --> 24:04.526
And, uh...

24:04.609 --> 24:06.528
And move forward.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.617
I think the big thing
is just play full speed.

24:12.701 --> 24:16.037
You know, play full speed and...

24:16.121 --> 24:18.456
Play like your hair's on fire
and we'll be fine.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.376
Hey, man, how's it going there?
Everything's good?

24:24.588 --> 24:25.630
[whistles]

24:25.714 --> 24:27.883
Go lay down.
Go lay down.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.426
In your room.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.096
Go lay down in your room.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.765
You don't need to be out
in the light and all that stuff.

24:35.849 --> 24:38.310
[stutters] In the heat.
Go lay down in your room.

24:39.686 --> 24:42.230
[Buddy] <i>When you deal</i>
<i>with something like a head injury,</i>

24:42.314 --> 24:43.440
<i>you can't play with it.</i>

24:43.523 --> 24:46.735
So, you have to err on the side of,
of being safe and not...

24:46.818 --> 24:48.153
not letting that happen.

24:48.236 --> 24:51.781
<i>Ollie... I really can't tell</i>
<i>if Ollie's got a headache</i>

24:51.865 --> 24:54.743
<i>or if he's got a concussion</i>
<i>'cause you just don't know Ollie.</i>

24:54.826 --> 24:56.661
[chuckles] <i>You know?</i>
<i>You just don't know.</i>

24:56.745 --> 24:58.580
<i>Sometimes Ollie wants attention</i>

24:58.663 --> 25:02.500
<i>and sometimes he's really...</i>
<i>he could be really hurt.</i>

25:02.584 --> 25:05.045
Everybody think he's faking.

25:05.128 --> 25:07.172
-[Wagner] Faking the concussion?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.800
{\an8}'Cause you know how Ollie is.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.677
{\an8}[mumbles] And then...

25:12.761 --> 25:16.389
{\an8}'Cause of that, now he can't...
he won't be able to play Thursday.

25:16.473 --> 25:19.100
Well, I mean, but did they not
take him to the doctor?

25:19.184 --> 25:20.560
No, not this time.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.854
Why is somebody mad at...
They're mad at him for that?

25:22.938 --> 25:24.564
'Cause, I mean, that's pretty dumb.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.066
I don't think they're mad at him,

25:26.149 --> 25:29.027
they just don't want him to be
whining anymore and whatever.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.403
Well, then take him to the doctor,

25:30.487 --> 25:33.114
and if he has a concussion, great,
if not, great.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.909
Yeah, but...

25:35.992 --> 25:38.036
They won't let him play Thursday.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.622
-And he--
-They won't let him play Thursday,

25:40.705 --> 25:43.208
but they don't think he has a concussion.
They think he's faking it.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.085
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

25:47.295 --> 25:50.465
{\an8}My senior year,
I played last year and then, uh,

25:51.424 --> 25:53.885
{\an8}two games near the end of the season,

25:53.969 --> 25:56.012
{\an8}<i>I got my fifth concussion in 14 months.</i>

25:56.096 --> 25:59.432
{\an8}<i>I was still playing and then the trainers</i>
<i>pulled me aside and looked at me</i>

25:59.516 --> 26:02.185
{\an8}and they could tell I wasn't right
and then went inside, did tests,

26:02.269 --> 26:03.853
{\an8}and they pulled me out of that game,

26:03.937 --> 26:06.731
{\an8}and then we did some extensive tests
and they said, you know,

26:06.815 --> 26:10.277
you're not gonna be able to play again,
but I never quit fuckin' anything.

26:11.569 --> 26:15.031
I've gotten more damn interviews
since I've retired than...

26:15.115 --> 26:17.450
or, stopped playing, since,
than when I was playing.

26:17.534 --> 26:20.495
<i>The damn</i> New York Times <i>were here</i>
<i>last week on it, you know.</i>

26:20.578 --> 26:23.206
<i>The story that got out was that,</i>
<i>you know, 'cause I didn't tell</i>

26:23.290 --> 26:25.333
any of the trainers
about all my concussions,

26:25.417 --> 26:27.877
except for the ones that
I got knocked out of, obviously,

26:27.961 --> 26:29.421
and you don't have to tell 'em.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.631
I got ones that I hid, um,

26:31.715 --> 26:33.675
and they're like,
"What'd you do? Do you regret that?

26:33.758 --> 26:35.927
Are you having any problems with it now?"

26:36.011 --> 26:38.013
<i>Not really, and I don't regret it at all</i>

26:38.096 --> 26:39.931
<i>because I might have been pulled</i>
<i>earlier than I was,</i>

26:40.015 --> 26:42.600
<i>when I was retired...</i>
<i>you know, forced to stop.</i>

26:42.684 --> 26:45.020
<i>So, uh, don't regret it.</i>

26:45.103 --> 26:48.481
<i>It's part of the game.</i>
<i>Although, yeah, it's for...</i>

26:48.565 --> 26:52.402
it's had... I've had some brain problems
and some trouble with that,

26:52.485 --> 26:55.530
<i>but this game's done so much more for me</i>
<i>than anything else could have ever done.</i>

26:55.613 --> 26:57.991
<i>It's all I've known.</i>
<i>It's all I've cared to known.</i>

26:58.074 --> 27:00.035
<i>It's all I've loved.</i>
<i>It's all I've cared to love.</i>

27:00.118 --> 27:03.121
Um, and I wouldn't change it for anything.

27:16.718 --> 27:21.139
[Ollie] It's just been tough.
Just not to play and not to practice.

27:21.222 --> 27:22.599
That be killin' me.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.726
It's crazy.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.355
I been sleepin' all week.

27:28.438 --> 27:31.733
Can't do nothing,
couldn't go to no meetings or nothing.

27:31.816 --> 27:35.362
Walk-throughs, practices, or nothing,
just been in my room.

27:37.739 --> 27:40.367
Man, I wish I was out there.

27:41.576 --> 27:43.787
[Buddy] Come off the ball.
Come on, come on!

27:43.870 --> 27:45.288
-Good, good!
-[whistle blows]

27:46.373 --> 27:47.999
{\an8}-Is that Isaiah?
-Yeah.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.002
{\an8}What's he run like?

27:52.712 --> 27:54.089
{\an8}Fast.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.465
[indistinct chatter]

27:55.548 --> 27:57.425
[Buddy] He's on every special team.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.344
What about Ronald Ollie?

28:00.387 --> 28:03.431
Coach, if you'll go up
to room 111 up there,

28:03.515 --> 28:06.476
and, uh, 112, all right,
if you wanna knock on the door,

28:06.559 --> 28:08.978
you can find Ollie layin' in bed.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.647
What're you talking about?

28:10.730 --> 28:11.856
-He's--
-Shut it down?

28:11.940 --> 28:14.859
[stutters] Said he hurt his--

28:14.943 --> 28:18.405
He had a concussion without a headache.

28:18.488 --> 28:19.823
Now, I ain't figured it out yet.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.200
No, but he's got a concussion
and he's, you know...

28:22.283 --> 28:27.455
and the doctor says he's got,
he's got... he's like, um, he's...

28:27.539 --> 28:31.751
he's affected by light,
and he has a neck injury.

28:31.835 --> 28:36.214
Well, the neck... the neck
didn't start hurting him until Friday

28:36.297 --> 28:38.925
and he told me that
it was how he slept on it.

28:39.008 --> 28:40.677
-Mmm.
-[chuckles] So, I mean...

28:40.760 --> 28:42.887
-Is this team doctor or family doctor?
-Oh, team doctor.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.306
Well, it's a... it's a neurologist.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.101
And when he went to see the neurologist,
he said... he said he had...

28:48.184 --> 28:51.104
he had a sensitivity to light
when he shined the light in his eyes.

28:51.187 --> 28:54.357
Hell, I got a sensitivity to light
when you shine a light in my eyes.

28:54.441 --> 28:57.152
So, well, when he comes outside,
he says... he says he's...

28:57.235 --> 28:59.112
he says he's, uh...

28:59.195 --> 29:01.406
When he goes outside, he's, uh...

29:01.489 --> 29:03.742
Hey! Let's go, Tyree!

29:05.076 --> 29:08.079
He said when he goes outside,
he'd been in his room, he goes outside...

29:08.163 --> 29:11.583
the light makes him... hurts his eyes.

29:11.666 --> 29:14.711
Hell yeah, when you been
layin' up in a cold room,

29:14.794 --> 29:17.130
-sleeping all day. You go outside...
-[laughs]

29:20.967 --> 29:23.136
[Wagner] Ollie.
What're... what're you doing?

29:23.845 --> 29:25.513
What're you doing?

29:30.935 --> 29:32.395
What the hell?

29:35.356 --> 29:36.816
He just hung up on me.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.402
[Wagner] <i>He just said,</i>
<i>"I'm finna' go home, man.</i>

29:39.486 --> 29:42.989
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

29:43.072 --> 29:44.908
But it just ain't meant to be."

29:44.991 --> 29:47.285
He sent that at 2:15.

29:47.368 --> 29:50.455
Since I've texted him after that,
he hasn't responded.

29:50.538 --> 29:53.958
<i>Think everybody's just on edge.</i>
<i>I mean, we lost.</i>

29:55.627 --> 29:57.629
[line ringing]

30:01.591 --> 30:05.178
[automated voice] <i>I'm sorry, but</i>
<i>the person you called has a voicemail box</i>

30:05.261 --> 30:07.013
<i>-that has not been set up yet.</i>
-[sighs] Damn it.

30:07.096 --> 30:08.723
Answer the phone.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.064
-[line beeps]
-Oh, my gosh.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.274
I'm really gonna freaking
drive over to your dorm.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.949
-I don't understand.
-[cell phone chimes]

30:26.032 --> 30:27.909
Oh, hold on, hold on.

30:27.992 --> 30:31.579
"Man, Coach Stephens talking crazy to me

30:31.663 --> 30:37.544
and shit-talkin' about...
I just want attention.

30:38.586 --> 30:42.549
Man, I did every fucking thing
possible to satisfy y'all. Every..."

30:42.632 --> 30:43.842
Whoa!

"Every motherfucking thing
y'all asked me to do, I've done.

30:47.762 --> 30:50.515
[stutters] I did it.

30:50.598 --> 30:52.851
I'm trying to help the team win.

30:52.934 --> 30:56.688
Talking about me, I'm being a baby.
I ain't never been a fucking baby."

30:59.315 --> 31:03.778
<i>The minute that Ollie feels</i>
<i>threatened or called out,</i>

31:03.862 --> 31:06.573
<i>I mean, his reaction</i>
<i>is to just either flee</i>

31:06.656 --> 31:09.659
<i>or he's gonna go right back at you.</i>
<i>He doesn't stop himself.</i>

31:10.660 --> 31:12.370
Pretty sure he's on this side.

31:12.453 --> 31:16.499
But I'm not gonna stop on this side
because everyone will see that.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.167
So we're gonna pull around...

31:18.251 --> 31:21.588
<i>When you get a kid like that, having</i>
<i>gone through everything he's been through,</i>

31:21.671 --> 31:24.883
<i>I mean, you know, if Coach</i>
<i>yells at him and tells him to leave,</i>

31:24.966 --> 31:27.510
<i>like, that's kind of</i>
<i>abandonment in his eyes.</i>

31:27.594 --> 31:30.138
<i>So then, it's like</i>
<i>he's got to do something to see...</i>

31:30.221 --> 31:33.558
<i>Is everybody that he,</i>
<i>that he cares about abandoning him or,</i>

31:33.641 --> 31:36.185
<i>like, where does everybody else stand?</i>

31:36.269 --> 31:37.520
[clicks tongue]

31:38.313 --> 31:41.566
"Will you come out here and just...

31:42.734 --> 31:45.862
talk to me for a second?

31:45.945 --> 31:49.324
Coach is just...

32:07.425 --> 32:09.218
"All right." [chuckles]

32:09.302 --> 32:11.220
One word. Bleh!

42:41.475 --> 42:42.810
<i>Roberts gonna leave it</i>

42:42.893 --> 42:44.770
<i>Law coming around nearside.</i>
<i>He's gonna be hit...</i>

42:44.853 --> 42:46.564
<i>uh, by a couple of guys</i>
<i>who he pinballs off of.</i>

42:46.647 --> 42:48.941
<i>He stays down the nearside line,</i>
<i>he may score.</i>

42:49.024 --> 42:53.153
<i>He's inside the 30, 20, 15,</i>
<i>ten, five, touchdown! DJ Law!</i>

42:53.237 --> 42:55.114
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

42:55.197 --> 42:57.366
<i>Law got absolutely smoked.</i>

42:57.449 --> 43:00.077
[Trickett] Good fucking run, baby!

43:00.160 --> 43:02.788
That's what I'm fuckin' talking about.
Good shit, DJ!

43:02.871 --> 43:04.540
Good fuckin' run!

43:04.623 --> 43:06.875
[announcer 1] <i>Good, now that's</i>
<i>54-yards on the touchdown run</i>

43:06.959 --> 43:09.044
<i>for DJ Law and EMCC is up</i>

43:09.128 --> 43:11.380
<i>20 to 7, pending the PAT.</i>
<i>What a run, Glenn.</i>

43:11.463 --> 43:13.173
-[announcer 2] <i>What a run.</i>
-I bounced off that shit.

43:13.257 --> 43:15.593

43:31.483 --> 43:34.445
[Buddy] Let's go.
[player] There you go. There you go.

[announcer 1] <i>In the shotgun,</i>
<i>awaits the snap. Here it is.</i>

43:38.115 --> 43:39.283
<i>He's back to pass, has time.</i>

43:39.366 --> 43:41.869
<i>Fires it nearside</i>
<i>and it's intercepted at the 29!</i>

43:41.952 --> 43:46.540
<i>Going down the nearside line,</i>
<i>15, ten, five, touchdown, EMCC!</i>

43:46.624 --> 43:50.794
<i>CJ Reavis will make the pick-six</i>
<i>from the 29 and score.</i>

43:50.878 --> 43:53.672
<i>CJ Reavis, once he caught</i>
<i>that one at the 29,</i>

43:53.756 --> 43:56.342

44:17.446 --> 44:19.323
[crowd cheering]

44:20.783 --> 44:22.409
[player] Let's go, bro. Let's go!

44:22.493 --> 44:24.286
1-0 again, baby. Let's go!

44:24.370 --> 44:26.330
[announcer 1] <i>A fade pattern, nearside.</i>
<i>He has Lanier...</i>

44:26.413 --> 44:28.582
[announcer 2] <i>What a catch!</i>
[announcer 1] <i>He caught it!</i>

44:28.666 --> 44:30.292
<i>Touchdown!</i>

44:30.376 --> 44:32.294
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>
<i>Are you kidding me!</i>

44:32.378 --> 44:34.713
[announcer 2] <i>Guys, that was</i>
<i>a phenomenal catch by Lanier.</i>

44:34.797 --> 44:36.840
[announcer 1] <i>He caught that ball?</i>
[announcer 2] <i>He did.</i>

44:36.924 --> 44:39.343
<i>Down at his knees, falling back...</i>

44:39.426 --> 44:41.887
Your ass is a good football team,
you understand?

44:41.970 --> 44:43.972
-[players] Yes, sir!
-Don't make me go into the halftime

44:44.056 --> 44:45.516
and do that bullshit no more.

44:45.599 --> 44:48.435
You play from the damn word "go."
Great job, guys! Great job!

44:48.519 --> 44:50.604
That's a heck of a good job

44:50.729 --> 44:54.149
to come back and play
the way you can play! Hey!

44:54.233 --> 44:55.734
You ain't gotta be back
till Sunday at curfew.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.986
[all cheering]

45:14.211 --> 45:15.254
[TV playing]

45:15.337 --> 45:17.506
[babbling]

45:20.300 --> 45:21.760
Dreads...

45:24.596 --> 45:26.432
Re-twist...

45:26.515 --> 45:28.934
[man on TV] <i>When we come back,</i>
<i>the story of the Georgia running back</i>

-[baby humming]
-[Ollie] All right.

45:38.277 --> 45:39.445
[groans]

45:40.487 --> 45:42.448
-Mama!
-[Takesha] Mmm?

45:42.531 --> 45:45.075
She put... She puttin' her shoes on.
We finna' go.

45:46.243 --> 45:48.412
[indistinct chatter]

45:54.543 --> 45:56.879
[Rachel] <i>When he started playing,</i>
<i>at the time, when he was pee-wee,</i>

45:56.962 --> 45:58.922
the coaches always tell him,
"If you get a sack,

45:59.006 --> 46:01.175
we'll take you out to eat pizza."

46:01.258 --> 46:02.843
Oh, my God. [laughs]

46:02.926 --> 46:06.138
He get four or five of 'em.
He wouldn't stop.

46:06.221 --> 46:08.807
And then they'd tell him again.
Next day, someone would holler,

46:08.891 --> 46:10.309
"I'll give you $10,
I'll give you some money

46:10.392 --> 46:12.227
if you do this, do that, at the game."

46:12.311 --> 46:13.979
So, he was determined to do that.

46:16.106 --> 46:18.484
[Vera] <i>When I first saw him</i>
<i>play football in high school...</i>

46:18.567 --> 46:19.610
You know, I don't know
nothin' about football,

46:19.693 --> 46:22.029
but I couldn't sit down.
He won't let me sit down.

46:23.238 --> 46:25.407
If I sat down, I was scared
I was gonna miss somethin'.

46:25.491 --> 46:28.285
When they holler his name,
I said, "Oh, my God."

46:28.368 --> 46:31.371
<i>It's good to have a child</i>
<i>going this way.</i>

46:35.501 --> 46:37.252
[Takesha] <i>He was small,</i>
<i>he was only five.</i>

46:37.336 --> 46:39.171
<i>He was five when it happened.</i>

46:40.214 --> 46:43.342
<i>So, he really probably can't tell you</i>
<i>nothing about it, but...</i>

46:44.259 --> 46:45.677
<i>Actually, we was here.</i>

46:45.761 --> 46:47.888
At the time, my mama was renting
this same trailer right now

46:47.971 --> 46:49.515
that our cousin is renting.

46:51.934 --> 46:54.186
[Rachel] <i>Been home about 10:00 that night</i>

46:54.269 --> 46:56.230
<i>somebody was knocking on my door.</i>

46:56.313 --> 46:58.899
<i>I thought it was my son coming back home.</i>

46:58.982 --> 47:01.735
But it wasn't him.
It was him.

47:01.818 --> 47:04.321
Ronald's father, looking for her.

47:05.989 --> 47:08.492
<i>He always down here botherin' her,</i>
<i>pickin' at her.</i>

47:08.575 --> 47:09.826
<i>She just called the police.</i>

47:09.910 --> 47:11.578
Kept callin' the police.
Kept calling...

47:11.662 --> 47:12.829
When he would come down here

47:12.913 --> 47:15.207
and get into it with her,
I always could hear it.

47:15.290 --> 47:17.292
You know, 'cause I was just right there.

47:17.376 --> 47:21.296
But this particular night,
it just wasn't meant for me to hear.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.090
[Takesha] <i>I could hear the argument.</i>

47:23.173 --> 47:25.634
<i>They was arguing.</i>
<i>Like, my room was the...</i>

47:25.717 --> 47:28.887
<i>first window over here</i>
<i>and his was the second.</i>

47:28.971 --> 47:31.014
You know,
I'm just listening to the argument

47:31.098 --> 47:33.058
then the next thing I hear, gunshot.

47:34.935 --> 47:38.063
When I hear the gunshots, I jump up,
I ran out, I see him running.

47:38.146 --> 47:40.774
Running straight through this path.
And went around here.

47:40.857 --> 47:42.818
And the police was chasing him.

47:42.901 --> 47:45.195
And they said... police said
by the time they make it to him,

47:45.279 --> 47:46.572
they heard a gunshot.

47:46.655 --> 47:50.784
He had shot himself under...
Shot and killed himself.

47:50.867 --> 47:52.035
Mmm-hmm.

47:53.495 --> 47:54.955
Yeah.

47:55.038 --> 47:56.915
[Takesha] <i>Yeah, he'll call me,</i>
<i>he'll talk about it.</i>

47:56.999 --> 47:59.793
<i>Because it was his mom and his dad.</i>
<i>It wasn't our dad.</i>

47:59.876 --> 48:03.130
<i>So, you know, for him to lose his mom</i>
<i>and his dad, you know what I'm sayin'?</i>

48:03.213 --> 48:06.258
<i>I can only imagine 'cause, like I said,</i>
<i>he was only five.</i>

48:06.842 --> 48:09.136
<i>Like, we were leaving the hospital</i>
<i>when our mama got killed,</i>

48:09.219 --> 48:11.054
he was like, "We leavin' mama?"

48:11.138 --> 48:13.724
He thought that she was gonna be all right
and come home.

48:13.807 --> 48:16.310
He didn't get the understanding there,
like, she's gone forever.

48:16.393 --> 48:18.395
He just thought she was gone to the back.

48:18.478 --> 48:19.771
I guess 'cause he was so young

48:19.855 --> 48:22.190
but he thought that
she was supposed to come with us

48:22.274 --> 48:25.527
but that was a night
that took a toll on all of us.

48:29.781 --> 48:31.908
<i>But like, in the beginning, like,</i>
<i>I could look at him,</i>

48:31.992 --> 48:35.329
and I could see his dad.
He looks like his dad too.

48:35.412 --> 48:36.872
And I used to just be like,

48:36.955 --> 48:39.333
"Boy, I can't stand your daddy,"
and people used to tell me, like,

48:39.416 --> 48:41.376
"Don't say that to him."
You know what I'm sayin'?

48:41.460 --> 48:43.879
They felt like, if it weren't
for Ronald's dad,

48:43.962 --> 48:45.380
they mom would be living.

48:45.464 --> 48:48.091
And I had to sit down
and go through that with them.

48:48.175 --> 48:50.218
I said Ronald didn't ask for that.

48:50.302 --> 48:51.470
<i>He's still your brother.</i>

48:51.553 --> 48:54.097
<i>You know, he got a lot</i>
<i>bottled up inside of him too.</i>

48:54.181 --> 48:57.184
<i>He feel like people don't love him,</i>
<i>nobody loves him.</i>

48:57.267 --> 49:00.312
You know, he'll say that sometime.
"Why nobody don't love me?"

49:00.395 --> 49:02.230
I said, "People..."
I said, "I love you."

49:02.314 --> 49:03.607
<i>I said, "We do love you."</i>

49:03.690 --> 49:07.277
<i>You know, they'd be</i>
<i>in this feelings, then. Mmm-hmm.</i>

49:09.821 --> 49:12.783
We couldn't do nothing.
And I know they couldn't do nothing.

49:13.700 --> 49:14.868
But...

49:16.995 --> 49:18.372
we're gonna make it.

49:19.122 --> 49:20.791
<i>But, y'all keep praying for us.</i>

49:21.750 --> 49:23.251
<i>And he'll go further.</i>

49:23.335 --> 49:26.088
<i>Let him go furthest he can go, Lord.</i>

49:26.171 --> 49:28.507
<i>Whatever on his mind that</i>
<i>he wanna do with that football,</i>

49:28.590 --> 49:30.092
<i>let him take it further.</i>

49:30.175 --> 49:34.513
<i>And God be on his side with us with him.</i>
<i>He gonna make it.</i>

49:35.639 --> 49:37.015
<i>He gonna make it.</i>

49:50.112 --> 49:52.030
Ooh, hell yeah.

49:55.742 --> 49:57.577
[Ollie] <i>Live for the moment.</i>

49:57.661 --> 50:00.747
<i>Never know when you're gonna die,</i>
<i>so, live for the moment.</i>

50:05.585 --> 50:08.630
<i>I really don't love football...</i>

50:08.714 --> 50:10.549
<i>it's just something I can do.</i>

50:11.967 --> 50:14.344
<i>I'm just worried about</i>
<i>the paychecks really.</i>

50:16.805 --> 50:20.308
<i>I plan on trying to make it to the league.</i>

50:20.392 --> 50:22.978
<i>I hope so.</i>
<i>If that doesn't work out...</i>

50:23.061 --> 50:24.354
<i>uh...</i>

50:24.438 --> 50:26.857
<i>I don't have too many plan B's, so...</i>

50:26.940 --> 50:30.902
<i>the first plan gotta happen.</i>
<i>It gotta happen.</i>
