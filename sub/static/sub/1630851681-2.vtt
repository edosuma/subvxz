00:05.005 --> 00:06.040
<i>Previously on</i> Hightown...

00:06.073 --> 00:07.675
<i>Three kids dead from OD.</i>

00:07.675 --> 00:09.377
Put me in, Coach.
I could ride with Babcock.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.778
My sponsor said, "Buy a suit,

00:11.011 --> 00:12.213
<i>'cause you're gonna be
going to a lot of funerals."</i>

00:12.246 --> 00:13.647
You on some revenge trip
for your boy Junior?

00:13.681 --> 00:14.548
That is not it.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.617
<i>I don't come near Renee
so I can get my job back.</i>

00:16.650 --> 00:18.586
<i>There's a pattern
of problematic behavior</i>

00:18.619 --> 00:20.254
<i>-with women.</i>
- Sorry it didn't go your way.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.022
- What are you gonna do now?
- Time to spend with my kid.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.624
- What about Kizzle?
- His mom hasn't seen him.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.593
<i>She says that's normal.</i>

00:25.626 --> 00:27.328
<i>Sean Gandam,
skinny white kid?</i>

00:27.361 --> 00:28.729
<i>You're looking at
the hardest time there is.</i>

00:28.763 --> 00:30.564
<i>We're gonna make sure
you feel every second.</i>

00:30.598 --> 00:32.366
<i>Collin Connor,
aka Coco.</i>

00:32.400 --> 00:33.401
He's a known dealer.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.602
Drug side should be involved.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.637
Thank you for sucking
that cop's dick.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.305
<i>Wayne's out.
We're handling it.</i>

00:38.339 --> 00:39.640
He got people out there.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.575
<i>Charmaine--you got
that fire from New Beige.</i>

00:41.609 --> 00:43.110
Now all the cops on the Cape
are looking for you.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.278
What you trying to do about it?

00:44.311 --> 00:45.813
Me and my cousin
want to be your partners.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.181
Why do you have to go after it?

00:47.214 --> 00:48.716

<i>Mm, bet that's not
all you've been tagging.</i>

02:35.256 --> 02:36.724
End of the season,

02:36.757 --> 02:39.326
some of those girls in P-Town
get lonely.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.595
Nah, man, I chilled out
with that.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.831
Yeah, right.
You fucking deviant.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.770
I don't know, Jack.
Nothing's biting.

02:49.803 --> 02:50.771
<i>Yeah, that's 'cause I let you</i>

02:50.804 --> 02:52.172
<i>bait the hook, dipshit.</i>

02:52.206 --> 02:53.774
Reel it in.
I'll show you how it's done.

02:56.644 --> 02:57.945
Hey, give it a minute,
all right?

02:59.213 --> 03:00.848
Maybe I just like the company.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.357
So where you been, man?

03:10.391 --> 03:11.926
Feels like forever
since I seen you.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.265
Just trying to lay low,
you know?

03:19.700 --> 03:20.935
<i>Things are okay?</i>

03:22.636 --> 03:24.939
Yeah, I mean...

03:24.972 --> 03:26.740
I miss Mackayleigh.

03:26.774 --> 03:27.741
Donna.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.376
Why? Where are they?

03:31.545 --> 03:32.513
Jackie...

03:34.315 --> 03:35.516
Right.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.218
Right.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.691
I'm always here for you
if you need anything.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.595
Little late for that, bro.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.334
Oh, shit! Quick, quick, quick!
Grab the line! Grab the line!

03:53.367 --> 03:54.602
Thing's huge!

03:54.635 --> 03:56.537
Get the gaff hook.
Get the gaff hook.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.743
Junior! Junior!

04:05.479 --> 04:06.480
<i>Junior?</i>

04:08.649 --> 04:10.317
Junior?

04:10.351 --> 04:11.518
Junior!

04:18.592 --> 04:20.527
<i>This has been a tough week</i>

04:20.561 --> 04:23.297
<i>for Eastham North High School.</i>

04:23.330 --> 04:26.834
We lost three of our best
and brightest.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.503
But as always,

04:29.536 --> 04:32.272
The Mariners will rise above.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.308
We will heal.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.910
But right now,
I'd like to introduce

04:36.944 --> 04:40.014
Sergeant Alan Saintille
with Mass State Police.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.917
Him and his department
have been working tirelessly

04:43.951 --> 04:47.488
<i>to combat the opioid crisis
in our community,</i>

04:47.521 --> 04:50.057
<i>so please,
give him your attention.</i>

04:52.593 --> 04:54.895
Thank you,
Principal Peters.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.932
Um, thank you for having me,
and, um,

04:58.966 --> 05:00.601
sorry for your loss.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.570
Our loss.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.673
Because I live here too.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.642
Uh, I'm raising
a family here too.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.512
And I wish that I could say
that this was the first time

05:11.545 --> 05:13.714
I've been to one of these,
but I can't.

05:14.882 --> 05:18.018
<i>But you can make sure
this never happens again.</i>

05:18.052 --> 05:21.655
If someone tries
to sell you drugs,

05:21.689 --> 05:23.557
you walk away.

05:23.590 --> 05:27.061
If someone offers you to get
high with them, not interested.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.997
<i>It's your life.
You're in control.</i>

05:30.030 --> 05:32.466
If anyone has any information
about where Matt,

05:32.499 --> 05:34.835
Anna, and Luke
bought the drugs,

05:34.868 --> 05:37.805
you talk to me or any
of my officers here today.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.506
Any questions?

05:44.111 --> 05:47.848
So, like, do you know where
the drugs are coming from?

05:47.881 --> 05:50.484
I can't speak
on an ongoing investigation,

05:50.517 --> 05:51.552
but we have a lot of leads.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.853
<i>But also, like,</i>

05:52.886 --> 05:54.722
don't you think
if you arrest one drug dealer,

05:54.755 --> 05:56.123
people will just get it
from somewhere else?

05:56.356 --> 05:57.591
<i>Sure, yeah,</i>

05:57.624 --> 05:59.526
but we can make it
a little bit harder for folks.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.029
So, like, if you don't know
where the drugs are coming from

06:02.062 --> 06:04.631
<i>and you can't stop people
from using them,</i>

06:04.665 --> 06:06.100
what do you actually do?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.370
That's--

06:10.404 --> 06:11.805
And why is it
that when it was crack,

06:11.839 --> 06:13.140
it was all,
"Lock the Black people up

06:13.373 --> 06:14.608
<i>and throw away the key?"</i>

06:14.641 --> 06:17.144
But now it's opioids,
and it's all,

06:17.377 --> 06:19.480
"Poor white people.
It's an epidemic."

06:19.513 --> 06:21.749
They're both really bad, okay?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.684
But this new stuff
they're cutting the dope with,

06:23.717 --> 06:24.985
carfentanyl?

06:25.018 --> 06:28.422
It's a thousand times stronger
than fentanyl.

06:28.455 --> 06:32.993
And fentanyl is a thousand
times stronger than heroin.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.095
This stuff will kill you dead.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.902
Next question.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.144
- Harder!
- Harder?

06:50.177 --> 06:51.411
Yes!
- Like that?

06:51.445 --> 06:53.580
Faster! Oh, my God!

06:53.614 --> 06:55.649
Faster!

06:57.684 --> 06:58.852
- Don't stop! Don't stop!
<i>Okay.</i>

07:01.722 --> 07:03.757
- Stop! Stop!
- Stopping.

07:11.698 --> 07:15.135
Fantastic, Abruzzo. Five stars.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.746
If you got time after,
you know,

07:25.779 --> 07:28.615
we could, uh, get a bite
to eat.

07:29.483 --> 07:30.818
<i>Maybe round two?</i>

07:32.052 --> 07:35.088
It's just,
I have to pick up my husband.

07:35.122 --> 07:38.058
His car's in the shop. Sorry.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.227
Oh, no, yeah,
I-I totally get that.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.728
It's cool.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.998
Can you, uh, come in
to work early tonight?

07:45.032 --> 07:46.200
For what?

07:46.233 --> 07:48.035
You left a bunch
of half-empty ketchup bottles

07:48.068 --> 07:49.503
at the bar last night.

07:49.536 --> 07:54.007
I need you to fill 'em up
before your shift.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.744
Yeah, okay.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.849
Wonk-wonk! Thanks, Abruzzo.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.484
<i>See you later, Gina.</i>

08:29.776 --> 08:31.712
Ooh. Look at this.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.282
Oh. Help yourself.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.950
Thanks.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.720
Oh, yeesh.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.555
<i>How can anybody do this
to an egg?</i>

08:41.588 --> 08:43.724
How? I ate better than that
in Concord.

08:43.757 --> 08:47.594
Well, you know where they have,
um, really good eggs?

08:47.628 --> 08:49.529
- Is restaurants.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.964
You're gonna fall.
You're gonna fall.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.700
- Careful, please. Careful.
- Whoo!

08:53.734 --> 08:54.902
There you go.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.937
- Wow, Mama.
- Hey.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.706
Look at that. Amazing.

09:02.609 --> 09:03.977
Ooh!

09:04.978 --> 09:07.247
About that thing tomorrow,

09:07.247 --> 09:09.049
that thing with the girl.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.751
Yes, where?

09:10.751 --> 09:11.818
Xavier's.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.053
Perfect.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.055
Hello. English.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.890
Hello, don't you have
to be at work?

09:18.258 --> 09:20.093
Aren't you the manager?

09:22.996 --> 09:24.631
I worked last night.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.133
Is that what you call
finger-banging Daisy

09:26.166 --> 09:28.035
in the Champagne Room?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.804
- What's finger-banging?
- Enough!

09:30.837 --> 09:32.806
We're trying to have
a nice breakfast here.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.178
- She started it.
"She started it."

09:45.986 --> 09:47.721
<i>Hey.</i>
- Hey. Hey.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.598
Was that hard for you?
Seeing those kids?

09:58.632 --> 10:01.134
What, because of Junior? No.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.603
You can say yes. It's not soft.

10:03.637 --> 10:07.941
I know that.
It's just--it's fine.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.210
I mean, you must've lost people
that way too, right?

10:10.243 --> 10:12.980
Nobody I didn't arrest.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.785
Look, I just want you
to know it's cool

10:18.819 --> 10:21.121
and that we can talk
about shit.

10:21.154 --> 10:24.157
Fuck talking.
Let's get back to work.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.759
Yes.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.998
Hey, Babcock, Quinones,
where we at?

10:31.932 --> 10:33.333
We got some
controlled buys set up,

10:33.367 --> 10:34.801
but first, we were gonna finish

10:34.835 --> 10:36.269
going through the kids'
phone downloads.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.938
So far, no texts or calls

10:37.971 --> 10:39.673
linking them
to any known drug dealers.

10:39.706 --> 10:40.774
Fuck.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.743
Oh, uh, toxicology reports
came back.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.779
Kids had MDMA and carfentanyl
in their system.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.147
Carfentanyl's the shit
that killed Junior.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.849
- That links it to Frankie.
- Maybe, maybe not.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.150
Well, we should have eyes
on him.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.320
Whoa. You been full-time
on drug side all of one week.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.188
Now you got ideas
on how to do the job?

10:55.222 --> 10:56.423
I don't think so.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.091
Of course we're gonna be
watching Frankie.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.660
But controlled buys
are how you build a case.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.796
Start with the lower-level
drug dealers slinging the dope,

11:02.829 --> 11:04.064
and you work your way up.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.832
- We know who's selling it?
We don't know.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.134
We haven't been able
to find any.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.302
Eight buys this week.
It's all shit from off Cape.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.106
Somebody OD's
and every junkie in town

11:13.140 --> 11:14.374
is lining up
trying to chase that fire.

11:14.408 --> 11:15.776
Great White
should be popping off.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.077
Maybe they got spooked.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.745
If every cop on the Cape
was looking for me,

11:18.779 --> 11:20.313
I'd probably disappear.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.249
It's okay. We'll find it.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.017
I'm gonna talk to Shauna.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.686
Oh, super-snitch?
How's she doing?

11:26.720 --> 11:28.422
She's good.
She just got out of detox.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.757
Well, great, get on it, 'cause
I need to give LT something.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.006
What?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.008
<i>Yeah, Renee,
some chick's here to see you.</i>

12:26.947 --> 12:30.050
- Hey, how can I help you?
- Uh, I'm Donna.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.152
I'm here
for the cocktail waitress job.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.187
Oh, yeah.

12:34.221 --> 12:37.424
Um, I'm Renee.
I'm the assistant manager.

12:37.457 --> 12:41.261
And I guess I'm supposed to ask
if you have any experience.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.164
I've been waiting tables
in P-Town since I was 15.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.166
My last spot just closed
for the season.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.501
I-I brought a résumé,
if you want to see it.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.035
Oh, no. No, that's fine.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.004
Um...

12:51.037 --> 12:53.073
so why do you want
to work here?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.941
It was between this
and Stop & Shop,

12:54.975 --> 12:56.376
so fuck it, right?

12:56.409 --> 12:57.911
- Yeah.

12:57.944 --> 13:01.214
Look, you won't regret it.
I'm a hard worker. No drama.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.916
I just want to get home
to my baby.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.518
Aww, how old?

13:04.551 --> 13:07.187
<i>Sixteen months.</i>
- Oh, I miss that age.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.989
My baby boy just turned five.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.826
- I gotta do it.
- Yes. No, please, do it.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.194
- Let's see.
- Ah!

13:14.227 --> 13:15.495
<i>Here's Mackayleigh.
Oh, my God.</i>

13:15.529 --> 13:17.264
<i>She's so cute.</i>

13:17.297 --> 13:18.498
I always wanted a girl.

13:18.532 --> 13:20.367
You should have another.
Maybe you'll get lucky.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.502
Yeah. Maybe someday.

13:22.536 --> 13:24.905
Oh, I mean, yeah,
babies are so fucking hard.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.072
My parents help me a little,

13:26.106 --> 13:28.008
but I'm basically
doing it on my own, so--

13:28.041 --> 13:29.843
Yeah. No, I-I get it.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.078
Um, my son's father
just got back in the picture.

13:32.112 --> 13:35.815
But I was doing it
on my own for a while, so...

13:37.250 --> 13:39.019
Yeah, mine's not coming back.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.926
Shit. I'm sorry.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.127
No. Oh, God. I'm sorry.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.361
I don't mean to dump
all this on you.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.131
I-I swear to God I'm normal.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.599
No. No, it's fine.

13:52.832 --> 13:56.436
Um, look, I'm gonna be
straight with you.

13:56.469 --> 14:00.473
This-this place is a shithole.
It'll suck you in.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.943
Everyone comes here thinking
they'll stick to cocktailing,

14:02.976 --> 14:07.080
but after a while,
you always end up on the pole.

14:07.113 --> 14:10.150
I hear you, but I just--
I don't think that's me.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.985
And I really need the money.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.990
So do I have the job?

14:19.025 --> 14:20.894
Welcome to Xavier's.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.169
Damn, man! Wake the fuck up!

14:29.202 --> 14:31.304
<i>Why should I?</i>

14:31.338 --> 14:32.906
Sleep too much.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.407
Gotta seize the day.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.911
<i>Today gonna be
just the same as yesterday.</i>

14:54.461 --> 14:56.563
You been here a long time, huh?

14:56.596 --> 14:58.164
<i>Too damn long.</i>

14:59.165 --> 15:01.234
I feel you.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.437
Another way to look at it is,
you got experience.

15:05.939 --> 15:06.940
Knowledge.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.410
What you getting at?

15:10.443 --> 15:13.213
<i>I'm new, but I catch on quick.</i>

15:13.246 --> 15:14.681
There's gotta be something
we could do around here

15:14.914 --> 15:16.383
to better our lives.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.287
I'm out in ten months.

15:20.320 --> 15:24.057
I keep my head down, don't get
involved in no kind of schemes,

15:24.090 --> 15:28.295
stay right here in this bed
as long as they let me.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.964
Anyway, if I was
gonna get involved,

15:30.997 --> 15:32.299
it wouldn't be with you.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.268
You got too many enemies.

15:36.670 --> 15:39.172
Delgado! You got a visitor.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.940
- Approach the bars.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.279
Hurry the fuck up.

15:49.149 --> 15:52.419
Delgado on the move
to see visitor number five-oh!

15:52.452 --> 15:53.720
- Five-oh!

15:53.953 --> 15:55.021
<i>This fucker's a snitch!</i>

15:55.055 --> 15:56.022
<i>Snitch!</i>

15:56.056 --> 15:57.624
Very funny.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.492
- Asshole.

15:59.526 --> 16:00.994
Fucking LOL.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.301
You trying to get me killed?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.703
If I was,
somebody beat me to it.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.304
Your hand looks like
a fucking Q-tip.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.007
That's why you gotta
get me up out of here.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.509
Yeah, well, I looked
into your Drug Diversion Unit.

16:16.543 --> 16:17.744
And the place
is a fucking Hilton

16:17.977 --> 16:19.346
compared to where you are
right now.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.081
Can you make it happen?

16:21.114 --> 16:23.683
Sure. Question is, can you?

16:26.152 --> 16:27.387
I want to know
if the Cuevas cousins

16:27.420 --> 16:29.055
are moving carfentanyl
onto the Cape.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.523
My ass is in here.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.292
How the fuck am I supposed to
know what's going on out there?

16:32.325 --> 16:33.593
Your ass is in here
getting cut,

16:33.626 --> 16:36.029
which means
Frankie's not protecting you.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.630
So why you protecting him?

16:41.568 --> 16:44.237
All right, motherfucker.
Hope you're a light sleeper.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.040
Wait.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.412
Now, you know I ain't a snitch.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.182
But there is something
I been meaning to tell you.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.023
I'm waiting, motherfucker.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.761
Kizzle.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.432
- What about Kizzle?
- He's been MIA, right?

17:12.465 --> 17:15.468
Well, he ain't missing.
He's in one spot.

17:16.703 --> 17:20.473
Most of him, anyway.
Nickerson State Park.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.144
- Sean Gandam was murdered?
<i>Yep.</i>

17:25.211 --> 17:26.546
And I know who did it.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.818
Junior McCarthy.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.319
How you know that?

17:34.120 --> 17:36.156
Junior told me before he died.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.627
You know what? Fuck you.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.662
You give me a dead suspect
I can't even take to court.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.731
- That's bullshit.
- A body's a body, man.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.266
Yeah, if I can find it.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.268
Park's huge.
Where the fuck is the body?

17:48.301 --> 17:50.837
How the fuck should I know?
I wasn't there.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.675
You're so full of shit.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.582
Shauna!

18:02.615 --> 18:04.484
Where you going this early?
It's not even noon.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.253
Shit, Les. You scared me.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.655
I gotta go to Target.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.190
Oh, yeah, let me guess,

18:10.223 --> 18:12.192
you want to return something
but you lost the receipt?

18:12.225 --> 18:13.760
This laptop is a piece of shit.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.728
Look, I don't care.
Just don't get caught.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.532
You look good.
How much time you got?

18:19.566 --> 18:21.768
♪ Hey! Oh! ♪

18:21.801 --> 18:24.270
♪ Ten days! Oh! ♪

18:24.304 --> 18:27.207
- I'm happy for you.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.842
This is my new partner, Jackie.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.877
Hey. Ten days, that's big.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.347
Been a while
since I had double digits.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.115
Hear that.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.885
Hey, so look, Shauna,
you up for a mission?

18:40.753 --> 18:43.590
- What kind of mission?
- The $50 kind.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.657
Mm.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.226
I'm holding cash money
right here.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.394
<i>Not if I bust you for it.</i>

18:48.428 --> 18:49.662
You just said you didn't care!

18:49.696 --> 18:51.364
<i>Yeah, I could be
convinced not to care...</i>

18:51.397 --> 18:53.132
- Uh-huh.
-...if you know anything

18:53.166 --> 18:55.668
about the shit that killed
those kids in Chatham.

18:57.203 --> 18:59.272
Yeah, I know about that.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.575
Uh, people were talking
about it in detox.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.411
- Can you score some?
- Yeah, I know a guy.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.646
<i>How much you say again, 100?</i>

19:06.679 --> 19:08.414
Fifty.
You remember how this works.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.818
Seventy-five.
And I get to keep the computer.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.786
- What computer?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.799
Well, it's his grandma's place,

19:26.833 --> 19:28.902
<i>but she's in a nursing home
or something.</i>

19:28.935 --> 19:31.371
You sure he's got the stuff
with the shark on the baggie?

19:31.404 --> 19:33.406
Only one way to find out.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.645
<i>Get in, get out.
Don't buy anything else.</i>

19:38.678 --> 19:41.180
And hey, remember
those ten days you got?

19:42.649 --> 19:43.917
Let's make it 11.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.251
Oh! Nice shot, Nicky.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.553
Joshy?

20:21.554 --> 20:22.956
- What's up?
<i>Hey.</i>

20:22.989 --> 20:24.591
Hey, no, but you look
really good out there.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.792
I been-I been watching you
from the truck.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.860
Oh, I know. I saw you.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.562
You know, at first, I thought
you were some pedo,

20:29.596 --> 20:31.497
and then I was like,
"Oh, cool, it's my dad."

20:31.531 --> 20:33.399
Ha. Yeah, that's funny.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.601
<i>You still gotta work
on your fundamentals</i>

20:34.634 --> 20:35.735
<i>a little bit, you know?</i>

20:35.768 --> 20:36.970
You pull back
a little quicker,

20:37.003 --> 20:38.338
you're gonna get a lot more
on your snap shot.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.572
I haven't seen you
since last Christmas.

20:39.606 --> 20:40.974
You think we're fuckin' buds?

20:43.810 --> 20:45.578
Hey, you know what,
I was thinking me and you

20:45.612 --> 20:47.313
go down to Main Street,
get a slice.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.481
Let's go over to Angelo's.

20:48.514 --> 20:51.250
Angelo's closed, like,
six months ago.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.986
All right, want to go see
a movie or something?

20:55.421 --> 20:57.023
What's going on, Dad, you need
my kidney or something?

20:58.391 --> 21:00.393
No, I just got time off work,

21:00.426 --> 21:01.828
and I figured
me and you could hang out.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.298
Time off? What the fuck?

21:05.331 --> 21:06.499
Yeah, I got vacation days,
Nicky.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.601
Stop.
I don't give a shit, really.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.571
I mean, whatever reason
you're here, it's not for me.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.839
We both know that.

21:16.009 --> 21:18.277
You want to give me a break?

21:20.446 --> 21:23.850
Oh, by the way, mom says,
"Fuck off."

21:33.826 --> 21:37.296
Ugh. Shit's nasty.
I still want a cigarette.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.368
This is the boring part.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.070
I'm just happy to be on land.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.674
Shauna text you?

21:50.543 --> 21:52.412
What the fuck
is she doing in there?

21:52.445 --> 21:53.613
I don't know.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.981
What the fuck
are drug addicts ever doing?

21:55.014 --> 21:56.749
And why does it
take them so long?

21:56.783 --> 21:58.484
I spend half my time
asking these questions.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.754
- Text her again.

22:05.591 --> 22:08.061
Man, I feel like a dick,
sending her in there.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.562
I mean, she just got clean.

22:09.595 --> 22:12.031
Eh, ends justify the means.
But you're sweet.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.499
"Sweet"?

22:14.734 --> 22:16.803
That's a first.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.445
Anything?

22:29.916 --> 22:32.485
- Fuck it, let's go in.
- And blow our cover?

22:32.518 --> 22:33.986
No, we just buy it ourselves.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.888
- We need approval.
- Approval?

22:35.922 --> 22:37.690
We've been doing
controlled buys all week.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.425
What's the difference?

22:39.459 --> 22:40.793
You don't give a fuck, do you?

22:40.827 --> 22:42.962
She could be dead on the floor.

22:42.995 --> 22:45.631
I want to go in. Come on.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.670
All right, let's go.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.396
<i>Our friend Shauna
was supposed to cop for us.</i>

23:17.430 --> 23:19.632
She did cop. And then she left.

With my money,
that fucking bitch.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.504
You two, like, uh,
girlfriends or something?

23:24.537 --> 23:25.738
We're just hanging out.

23:25.772 --> 23:28.040
Dude, we just came here
to score.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.109
You got that shit
with the shark on the baggie?

23:30.143 --> 23:32.979
Yeah, I did.
Sold out last week.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.547
Got some Oxys for you, though.

23:34.580 --> 23:35.982
No, we don't want
fucking pills.

23:36.015 --> 23:39.452
Hey, I know you.

23:39.485 --> 23:40.686
Yeah.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.689
You had your hand
up my pussy last week.

23:43.723 --> 23:44.924
What?

23:44.957 --> 23:47.693
When I got pulled over
on Route Six?

23:47.727 --> 23:50.496
She's the one
that strip-searched me.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.700
Oh, fuck.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.037
Mass State Police. Nobody move.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.872
Fuck.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.780
- Shit!

24:07.814 --> 24:10.483
- I didn't do shit.
- Hey, stay down! Stay down!

24:10.516 --> 24:11.684
<i>Shut the fuck up.</i>

24:11.717 --> 24:12.752
<i>Put your hands
behind your back.</i>

24:12.785 --> 24:14.020
<i>Nothing's in there!</i>

24:14.053 --> 24:15.721
<i>Too high for this shit.</i>

24:15.755 --> 24:16.789
You okay?

24:18.057 --> 24:19.692
Fine.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.093
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

24:26.599 --> 24:29.202
Hey, Ray! Hey, nice shirt.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.804
Yeah. Bill Turner,
How you doing?

24:31.838 --> 24:33.973
Well, I'll be better
after a shot and a beer.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.508
Coming right up.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.213
Hey, put that away.
Blue discount.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.581
Oh, fuckin' A.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.752
So Abruzzo got MeToo'd, eh?

24:48.054 --> 24:50.790
- Something like that.
- Fucking shame.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.692
Cops can't be cops anymore.

24:53.759 --> 24:55.995
Hey, you're lucky you retired
when you did.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.263
Yeah.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.699
It's a different world,
you know?

24:59.732 --> 25:01.734
Everyone's so, uh, sensitive.

25:01.767 --> 25:03.636
You can't do this.
You can't say that.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.204
Everyone's got a camera
on their phone.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.709
So what are you gonna do?

25:09.742 --> 25:11.277
Hey, you're looking at it.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.547
What? Forget it. No.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.816
No, you--come work with me.

25:16.849 --> 25:17.984
- What, in construction?
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:18.017 --> 25:19.518
<i>You're in good shape. Why not?</i>

25:19.552 --> 25:21.554
Hey, Bill, I appreciate it.
I really do, but, um--

25:21.587 --> 25:24.290
No ex-cop
should have to fetch drinks.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.159
And don't tell me you're making
shit here in the winter time.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.595
<i>Probably get, like,
ten customers all day.</i>

25:29.629 --> 25:31.597
No, let me call my supervisor.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.266
We'll get you on the crew
for tomorrow.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.007
Fuck it. What time?

25:43.910 --> 25:46.646
I told you
that you wouldn't find shit.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.781
<i>No, asshole.
You told me you had Oxy.</i>

25:48.814 --> 25:49.982
<i>And we found 80 of them.</i>

25:50.016 --> 25:51.217
Under your nana's floorboards.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.618
Also found these.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.654
<i>The shit with the shark
on the baggie.</i>

25:55.855 --> 25:57.323
Here's the deal, Dug.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.992
<i>Possession with intent?
Least of your concerns.</i>

26:00.026 --> 26:02.561
Right now, you're looking at
three counts of manslaughter.

26:02.595 --> 26:03.629
Wait, what?

26:03.663 --> 26:06.132
Yeah, for the three kids
in Chatham.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.934
Nah, I didn't have anything
to do with that.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.101
Fuck manslaughter.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.770
You sold them the shit
that killed them.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.171
The stuff in the baggies
right here?

26:12.204 --> 26:14.974
And you're the only guy
on the Cape who's selling it.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.575
That's manslaughter.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.844
I-I didn't sell it to anyone.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.913
I got 'em, and then I kept it
for personal use.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.214
I swear to God that's it.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.783
Fine.
Well, where did you get them?

26:24.650 --> 26:26.752
I-I'd rather not say.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.321
Okay, fine.
Eat the manslaughter charges.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.089
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey, hey, hold on.

26:31.691 --> 26:36.195
Um... if I tell you
where I got it,

26:36.228 --> 26:39.732
will you, uh, drop the thing
about the three kids?

26:39.765 --> 26:41.600
I don't know. Try me.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.737
I got it from some guy.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.072
Who?

26:47.206 --> 26:49.976
Just some dude.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.610
He's not around anymore.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.181
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.383
He's just not around anymore.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.389
You talking about
Collin Connor?

27:03.622 --> 27:05.224
Coco?

27:08.094 --> 27:10.162
Fuck me.

27:12.365 --> 27:14.800
Why don't you tell us about
the last time you saw him?

27:17.770 --> 27:21.107
Hey.
We just closed on Coco Connor.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.375
- Bullshit.
<i>It's true.</i>

27:22.408 --> 27:24.076
<i>We busted a guy
named Dug Aquino.</i>

27:24.110 --> 27:25.644
He sells out
of his grandmother's house.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.046
He copped to it.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.348
He was buying from Coco.
Things got heated.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.817
<i>He shot him
and ganked Coco's supply.</i>

27:31.851 --> 27:34.420
- Great White?
- Yes, but he swore up and down

27:34.653 --> 27:36.122
he didn't sell it
to those three kids in Chatham.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.356
Seemed like he was
telling the truth.

27:37.390 --> 27:38.991
He know where the carfentanyl's
coming from?

27:39.025 --> 27:40.126
<i>No, we didn't get that far.</i>

27:40.159 --> 27:42.762
<i>-He asked for a lawyer.</i>
- Shit.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.431
Maybe I can take a run at him
after his arraignment tomorrow.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.334
Nice work, you two.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.170
Thanks.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.241
Holy shit, we solved
a motherfucking murder!

27:55.274 --> 27:57.810
I think we deserve a drink.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.678
Shit, I got somewhere to be.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.247
- Hot date?
- Hot date?

28:01.280 --> 28:03.215
No. Way less cool than that.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.251
I gotta make coffee
for a bunch of alcoholics.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.219
Can you blow it off?

28:07.253 --> 28:09.455
Uh, yeah.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.024
Let me-let me text someone,
see if they can cover.

28:22.768 --> 28:24.937
- Hey.
<i>Hey.</i>

28:24.970 --> 28:26.305
<i>We have to go
get some diapers.</i>

28:26.338 --> 28:27.940
<i>You want something
from the drugstore?</i>

28:29.208 --> 28:31.110
No, I'm good. I'm good.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.711
What is it, baby?

28:32.745 --> 28:34.146
<i>Nothing. Everything's great.</i>

28:34.180 --> 28:36.415
<i>Some guy Dug
confessed to murder.</i>

28:37.183 --> 28:39.018
<i>I can tell something's wrong.</i>

28:40.386 --> 28:43.089
<i>I got this thing
with Osito, this other CI,</i>

28:43.122 --> 28:44.390
<i>trying to tell me something</i>

28:44.423 --> 28:46.125
about a body
in Nickerson State Park.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.060
- A body?

28:48.094 --> 28:49.328
Wow, that's a big deal, right?

28:49.361 --> 28:50.830
<i>Sure, if he's
telling the truth.</i>

28:50.863 --> 28:52.164
But he's not.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.266
Just wants more privileges,
so he's trying to play me.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.335
What if you just play
the game too?

28:56.368 --> 28:57.803
What's that supposed to mean?

28:57.837 --> 28:59.772
<i>Alan, finding a body</i>

28:59.805 --> 29:02.141
<i>would be good for you, no?</i>

29:02.174 --> 29:03.476
Yeah.

29:04.977 --> 29:07.213
Look, believe me, if there's
a body in the woods,

29:07.246 --> 29:10.483
and this is a big if,
this guy put him there.

29:10.516 --> 29:13.919
So what? A body is a body.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.923
Well, if I call out body side
and dogs and all that shit

29:17.957 --> 29:20.993
and nothing's there,
I'm the asshole.

29:21.026 --> 29:24.130
But if you call them
and they find something,

29:24.163 --> 29:25.798
then you're the hero,

29:25.831 --> 29:27.833
the star.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.536
Yeah, the up-and-comer
who only just made sergeant

29:30.769 --> 29:34.773
but is known
to close his cases.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.275
<i>I left some griot
on the stove for you.</i>

29:36.308 --> 29:37.877
Oh, thank you, baby.

29:37.910 --> 29:40.312
<i>Make sure you eat.
Bye, baby.</i>

29:40.346 --> 29:42.381
All right. Bye.

29:48.154 --> 29:50.055
I mean, I've had some fisherman
get mouthy with me

29:50.089 --> 29:51.557
like get up in my space
a little,

29:51.790 --> 29:53.159
but I've never had
to tackle anyone.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.327
That was awesome.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.563
Did you see how scared I got
when that chick recognized me?

29:57.796 --> 30:00.199
Yeah, but you handled yourself.

30:00.232 --> 30:01.534
That was good.
We work well together.

30:01.567 --> 30:02.835
- We do.
- Yeah.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.170
- We do work well together.
- Yeah.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.172
Excuse me, get another one?

30:08.374 --> 30:10.376
Living dangerously
with that seltzer water.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.378
Yup.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.547
You really don't drink, do you?

30:14.580 --> 30:16.048
I really don't drink.

30:16.081 --> 30:18.217
- Boo!
<i>What?</i>

30:18.250 --> 30:19.351
Nothing.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.452
I just bet you're fun
to drink with.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.389
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm fun, till I'm not.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.859
And I'm waking up next to some
chick who's crying and...

30:26.892 --> 30:30.162
yelling about how I killed
her dog or something.

30:30.196 --> 30:31.897
You make a lot of girls cry?

30:33.832 --> 30:35.501
I have my moments.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.102
- You have a girlfriend?
- Me?

30:37.136 --> 30:38.437
- Mm-hmm.
- Fuck no.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.839
<i>Who's got time
for that kind of drama?</i>

30:40.873 --> 30:42.308
What about you,
you got a boyfriend?

30:42.341 --> 30:43.943
Or a girlfriend?

30:43.976 --> 30:45.945
Oh, no way. I like dick.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.449
I was even married to one once.

30:50.482 --> 30:51.884
<i>No shit.</i>

30:51.917 --> 30:54.253
<i>-How'd that work out for you?</i>
- Not great.

30:55.888 --> 30:56.922
Cheers.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.191
You changed your mind?

30:59.225 --> 31:01.860
Yeah, I think we both
changed our minds.

31:01.894 --> 31:05.631
It's good. Divorce is great.
I recommend it.

31:08.133 --> 31:10.502
Uh, we should probably
get out of here, right?

31:10.536 --> 31:12.171
We have such an early morning.

31:13.606 --> 31:15.341
Yeah.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.575
Hey.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.525
How you holding up?

31:33.559 --> 31:35.894
I'm great.

31:36.962 --> 31:38.664
You gotta get one of these.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.934
It'll save your back.
Yeah, it's like a girdle.

31:41.967 --> 31:43.469
Ah, Jesus, Bill.

31:43.502 --> 31:46.171
Well, anyway, it's lunchtime.
Don't be a fucking hero.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.239
That's what you gotta do.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.540
You gotta go up and down
in one day.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.376
Make sure this one guy
gives you a price.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.611
Guess how much I got
those sheets of drywall for.

31:52.645 --> 31:54.346
I don't know, $4.95?

31:56.482 --> 31:58.183
Hey, newbs, take a guess.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.187
Oh, you got me.

32:02.221 --> 32:05.157
-$4.63.

32:05.190 --> 32:06.558
Nice.
I don't know how you do it.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.193
Yeah. I get the best bargains.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.029
Because I play 'em
off each other.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.363
And that's how you gotta do it.

32:11.397 --> 32:14.266
<i>You gotta teach me.
Yeah.</i>

32:17.303 --> 32:20.039
<i>Hey, you don't want a beer?</i>

32:20.072 --> 32:21.307
I'm not really
a big drinker, Bill.

32:23.242 --> 32:26.045
Look, it's not chasing
bad guys, I know.

32:26.078 --> 32:29.081
But it beats serving mai tais
at happy hour, right?

32:29.114 --> 32:31.183
Yeah, sure.

32:31.216 --> 32:33.419
You'll see. It's a good life.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.389
Hey, we're, uh--
we're going out after work.

32:37.423 --> 32:40.225
You should come.
Yeah, get to know the guys.

32:40.259 --> 32:41.727
Usually end up at Xavier's,

32:41.960 --> 32:44.029
<i>the titty bar.</i>

32:47.066 --> 32:49.134
I don't think
that's a good idea, Bill.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.036
All right.
Change your mind...

33:08.287 --> 33:09.521
Excuse me.

33:09.555 --> 33:12.624
Huh? Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm?

33:12.658 --> 33:14.526
Oh, thank you.

33:16.261 --> 33:18.330
- Okay.
Thank you.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.698
Here you go, sweet cheeks.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.402
- Thank you.

33:23.435 --> 33:25.437
Mm.

33:25.471 --> 33:28.674
Okay.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.709
I want to know
everything about you.

33:30.743 --> 33:33.579
No, you don't. I'm boring.

33:33.612 --> 33:37.383
No, you're not boring, baby.

33:37.416 --> 33:40.152
Tell me something
you never told anybody else.

33:43.122 --> 33:44.456
Come on.

33:46.658 --> 33:49.027
One time when I was a kid,

33:49.061 --> 33:51.430
my parents took us
to the amusement park.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.265
It was supposed to be
really special,

33:53.298 --> 33:56.602
because my parents worked
all the fucking time.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.704
Anyway, uh,

33:58.737 --> 34:01.707
I stole a prize

34:01.740 --> 34:03.742
and got caught

34:03.776 --> 34:07.413
and I got questioned
by security.

34:08.714 --> 34:12.384
And the-the guy was--

34:15.487 --> 34:17.756
He was a creep.

34:17.790 --> 34:19.224
Hey, hey, hey.

34:19.258 --> 34:20.492
Look at me.

34:23.095 --> 34:25.230
I'll protect you from creeps.

34:25.264 --> 34:29.067
I will. I will.

34:29.101 --> 34:30.135
Thank you.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.274
Hello? Meeting time?

34:36.608 --> 34:38.811
<i>Vamos.</i>

34:38.844 --> 34:41.547
Okay, baby.
Go make us some money, honey.

34:43.515 --> 34:44.750
Yes, Daddy.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.758
Renee!

34:52.791 --> 34:56.195
Bottle of tequila
to the office, let's go.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.096
Oh, yeah!

34:58.130 --> 35:00.499
I'm thinking of wifing
this girl up, <i>primo.</i>

35:02.201 --> 35:05.404
Yo, Charmaine,
my cousin Frankie.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.439
Frankie, Charmaine.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.311
You didn't say she was a child.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.414
How old are you?

35:15.447 --> 35:16.849
You don't remember me, do you?

35:17.816 --> 35:21.153
It's all right. I remember you.

35:21.186 --> 35:22.721
You came to my Uncle Wayne's
place in New Bedford

35:22.754 --> 35:24.456
a few times,

35:24.490 --> 35:26.391
before you fucked up
and got yourself arrested.

35:31.663 --> 35:32.764
What's going on?

35:32.798 --> 35:34.433
We're talking
some private shit here.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.534
No need to be rude to the lady.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.135
Uh, I'm not some lady.

35:37.169 --> 35:38.337
Frankie's my fiancé,

35:38.370 --> 35:40.906
and this is
my office too, Jorge.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.509
What's the matter,
you don't trust your own girl?

35:44.443 --> 35:46.245
<i>If you got people around you
you don't trust,</i>

35:46.278 --> 35:47.279
then maybe we shouldn't
be in business.

35:47.312 --> 35:48.747
I never said
I didn't trust her.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.653
Take a seat.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.492
<i>Before we agree
to a partnership,</i>

36:00.526 --> 36:02.561
I have a few questions.

36:02.594 --> 36:06.365
Okay. Ask 'em.
I don't give a fuck.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.336
Will you be using the same
New York connect as Wayne?

36:11.370 --> 36:12.804
That's not your concern.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.440
If we're gonna be partners,
everything is my concern.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.409
Every day, you eat food
from a farm,

36:17.442 --> 36:19.211
but you ain't gotta know
the farmer.

36:19.244 --> 36:21.880
Same shit.
Supply is my responsibility.

36:21.914 --> 36:23.815
All good. Don't get excited.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.318
We just gotta know, how you
gonna get it onto the Cape?

36:26.351 --> 36:28.220
<i>'Cause we ain't gonna do
all this shit for you</i>

36:28.253 --> 36:30.722
to get pulled over by a cop
for a busted taillight

36:30.756 --> 36:32.457
and then start
spilling the beans.

36:34.359 --> 36:37.529
One, I don't talk to cops.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.531
Two, I don't drive.

36:39.565 --> 36:40.966
People be driving
fucking crazy.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.334
Texting and shit.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.435
So then how do you get it here?

36:43.468 --> 36:46.438
- The bus.

36:46.471 --> 36:49.508
- The bus? Seriously?
- You got a better idea?

36:49.541 --> 36:50.943
Ever heard of a private plane?

36:54.580 --> 36:56.448
It takes an hour and a half
to New York City.

36:56.481 --> 36:59.952
You and your important package,
safely delivered.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.922
You want me up on some
rickety-ass plane?

37:03.956 --> 37:06.692
Not doing that.
Fuck that.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.461
Not rickety-ass.

37:09.494 --> 37:12.631
I mean, we're talking
first class all the way.

37:13.865 --> 37:17.369
Champagne, shrimp cocktail.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.870
Isn't that right, Frankie?

37:21.239 --> 37:22.674
Only the best.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.579
Yeah, all right.

37:27.613 --> 37:30.916
So what do you say? Partners?

37:41.259 --> 37:43.962
Sure. Partners.

37:45.464 --> 37:48.300
- You know where to find me.
- Okay, whoa. One more thing.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.335
Who was your boy
that sold that stuff

37:50.369 --> 37:51.870
to those three kids in Chatham?

37:51.903 --> 37:54.806
Name's Gum Drop.
But I already set him straight.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.675
Told him to stop selling
for a while.

37:56.708 --> 37:57.709
<i>Okay, cool.</i>

37:57.743 --> 38:00.312
We just want to talk
to him ourselves.

38:00.345 --> 38:01.480
<i>I said I handled it.</i>

38:01.513 --> 38:03.048
He's not selling no more.
No one is.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.752
Of course.
But we want to talk to the guy.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.955
Do you know
where we can find him?

38:21.433 --> 38:22.901
Kit Kat or Almond Joy?

38:24.503 --> 38:27.539
- Kit Kat.
- There you go.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.041
Um... oh, shit.
I can't eat this.

38:29.074 --> 38:30.976
The coconut gets stuck
in my crown.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.577
You can have 'em both.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.049
Says here that you confessed
to shooting Collin Connor

38:37.082 --> 38:38.583
and stealing drugs from him.

38:38.617 --> 38:41.353
I've advised him not to discuss
the homicide charges.

38:41.386 --> 38:42.654
I can live with that.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.389
I just want to know
where he got the drugs from.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.758
I'm advising him
not to answer that either.

38:46.792 --> 38:47.793
Hmm.

38:48.994 --> 38:52.698
Dug, I want you to think
about this long and hard.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.866
<i>Because I'm trying to find out
who sold Great White</i>

38:54.900 --> 38:57.602
to the three dead kids
in Chatham.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.404
If you don't give me
any other names,

38:59.438 --> 39:03.008
I have no other place to look
than right at you.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.887
I don't know
where Coco got it from.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.657
He said he got a new plug.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.693
What's that mean, new?
New to him?

39:21.727 --> 39:23.428
Think he meant new to the Cape.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.564
Maybe newly returned?

39:25.597 --> 39:27.132
<i>Sure, maybe.</i>

39:28.366 --> 39:30.368
Did Coco get it
from one of these two dudes?

39:31.803 --> 39:33.839
I ain't saying shit
about them, a'ight?

39:33.872 --> 39:35.373
They'll fucking kill me.

39:35.407 --> 39:36.742
They'll kill you for telling me

39:36.775 --> 39:38.477
that they're bringing
carfentanyl to the Cape?

39:38.510 --> 39:40.545
Hey, I ain't say that.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.681
Didn't say what?

39:45.083 --> 39:47.552
Thank you, Counselor.
Thank you very much.

39:51.723 --> 39:52.958
Fucking Cuevas cousins.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.793
Fuck yeah.
That's what I've been saying!

39:54.826 --> 39:57.095
Hey, hold up, Dug didn't
actually give you shit.

39:57.129 --> 40:00.665
Look, I'm sick of dicking
around looking for dime bags.

40:00.699 --> 40:03.802
We start an operation
on them right now, all right?

40:03.835 --> 40:05.904
I'm talking about surveillance,
trash pulls, GPS.

40:05.937 --> 40:07.439
Good old-fashioned police work.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.941
So I want an ops plan
on my desk by Monday.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.576
- We clear?
- Crystal.

40:11.610 --> 40:14.146
Good, 'cause I gotta make
a run to Nickerson State Park.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.848
- What are you doing out there?
- Playing the game.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.619
What the hell was that?

40:20.652 --> 40:22.687
I don't know, but the boss
just left for the day.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.623
- You want to grab a mocktail?
- What's a mocktail?

40:24.656 --> 40:26.491
<i>Come on.
We can work on the ops plan.</i>

40:32.531 --> 40:35.734
Look, I'm gonna call it soon.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.837
It's cold
and there ain't shit out here.

40:38.870 --> 40:41.907
What, you, uh, want some
hot chocolate or something?

40:41.940 --> 40:43.441
Maybe some mittens
for your boys?

40:43.475 --> 40:45.010
Oh, fuck you.
You just got here.

40:45.043 --> 40:48.613
But we've been out here since
last night chasing our dicks.

40:48.647 --> 40:51.550
And I ain't authorized
to give out all this overtime.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.752
What? Really?

40:53.785 --> 40:55.453
The fuck, man?

40:55.487 --> 40:57.689
This is not
the fucking Boy Scouts.

40:57.722 --> 40:59.925
We are fucking
state troopers, man.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.527
We're not leaving here till
we find what there is to find.

41:06.631 --> 41:07.732
Fuck.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.473
Have you been here before?

41:15.507 --> 41:16.775
- What, Sandy Neck Beach?
- Mm-hmm.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.477
Oh, yeah, lots of times.

41:19.511 --> 41:20.745
With my ex.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.983
I can see that.
It's very romantic.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.651
Uh-huh.

41:28.186 --> 41:31.089
I saved a woman's life
here once.

41:31.122 --> 41:33.124
Holy shit.
- Yeah.

41:34.726 --> 41:37.262
She was drowning
and no one was doing anything,

41:37.495 --> 41:38.930
so I just--I went for it.

41:38.964 --> 41:42.100
And I'm not even
that strong of a swimmer.

41:42.133 --> 41:45.537
And, you know, it was
just like they say.

41:45.570 --> 41:49.541
She was pulling me under.
I just pushed through, I guess.

41:49.574 --> 41:50.809
And then the lifeguard
showed up.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.844
But there was a moment there

41:52.878 --> 41:56.047
where I thought
I was going to die.

42:03.722 --> 42:06.558
My heart's racing
just talking about it.

42:08.226 --> 42:10.862
I'm sorry that happened.

42:10.896 --> 42:12.831
It's okay.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.967
Are you a good swimmer?

42:19.571 --> 42:20.872
Yes.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.212
That's good.

42:30.782 --> 42:32.317
I'm glad we came here.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.139
Fuck me.

43:54.366 --> 43:57.268
Can I ask you a question?

43:57.302 --> 43:59.104
Anything. You know that.

43:59.137 --> 44:01.706
You trust Renee?

44:01.740 --> 44:03.341
Why wouldn't I?

44:03.375 --> 44:06.044
She soldiered up,
did what she had to do.

44:06.077 --> 44:08.313
Got us both out.

44:08.346 --> 44:09.881
Of course.

44:09.914 --> 44:13.184
I ain't got nothing
but gratitude for her.

44:13.218 --> 44:16.221
But she did fuck the same guy
that put us both away.

44:16.254 --> 44:17.422
You sure that's over?

44:18.990 --> 44:21.393
What the fuck
are you trying to say?

44:21.426 --> 44:24.829
Nothing, <i>papi.</i> Nothing.
She's a good girl.

44:28.900 --> 44:30.435
<i>Mm.</i>

44:37.709 --> 44:39.010
That's him.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.347
For old times' sake?

44:42.380 --> 44:44.182
- Yep.
- All right.

44:53.458 --> 44:55.093
Yo!

44:56.361 --> 44:59.330
- You Gum Drop?
- Yeah.

44:59.364 --> 45:01.232
Shit, you're Frankie Cuevas.

45:02.367 --> 45:03.868
You're Charmaine's boy, right?

45:03.902 --> 45:04.936
<i>Yeah.</i>

45:04.969 --> 45:07.138
She's working for us now.

45:07.172 --> 45:08.773
That means you're working
for us too.

45:08.807 --> 45:10.975
Yeah, that's cool, mm-hmm.

45:11.009 --> 45:13.044
Gotta pick up a package.
Get in.

45:13.078 --> 45:15.146
- Right now?
- Yeah, right fucking now.

45:15.180 --> 45:17.215
When do you think,
next Thursday?

45:17.248 --> 45:18.716
Fucking idiot.

45:21.886 --> 45:23.321
Yo, this a sick ride.

45:23.354 --> 45:25.723
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

45:25.757 --> 45:28.893
Yo, you know
where we could buy a boat?

45:28.927 --> 45:32.430
<i>Uh, yeah, I know a guy.</i>

45:32.464 --> 45:34.365
Okay. Let's go get a boat.

45:49.414 --> 45:50.849
I don't see any package.

45:50.882 --> 45:52.016
Oh, shit.

45:52.050 --> 45:53.084
<i>You sure it's out here?</i>

45:53.118 --> 45:54.419
Keep looking.

46:01.793 --> 46:05.230
Yo, Gum Balls,
let me ask you a question.

46:05.263 --> 46:07.966
Are you the guy
who sold that fire

46:07.999 --> 46:10.034
to those teenagers that died?

46:12.036 --> 46:14.906
- Yeah, that was me.
- What the fuck happened?

46:14.939 --> 46:17.041
<i>I mean, that whole
thing was totally random.</i>

46:17.075 --> 46:18.409
<i>Girl comes up to me
at the mall,</i>

46:18.443 --> 46:21.212
says she's looking for Molly
for her and her friend.

46:21.246 --> 46:25.316
Running a little bit short,
so I... I cut it with fire.

46:25.350 --> 46:27.418
Did what I had to do
to make the sale, you feel?

46:27.452 --> 46:29.988
Okay, so get this.
Get this, right?

46:30.021 --> 46:31.956
Rich white girl's
looking for Molly.

46:31.990 --> 46:33.424
<i>Right?
He gives her carfentanyl.</i>

46:33.458 --> 46:35.326
She's dead.
Now all of our faces

46:35.360 --> 46:38.129
are all over the wall
in the fucking post office.

46:38.163 --> 46:40.331
Always be closing, right?

46:42.367 --> 46:44.502
Do you know
how fucking stupid you are?

46:46.504 --> 46:49.874
- I-I-I was just trying--
- Eh, eh, eh, eh.

46:49.908 --> 46:52.043
Look at this <i>pendejo,</i>
trying to answer the question.

46:52.076 --> 46:54.245
<i>It's okay.</i>

46:54.279 --> 46:56.381
Don't hurt yourself.
I'm gonna tell you.

46:58.316 --> 46:59.817
You're too stupid to live.

47:05.857 --> 47:07.358
You ever see a shark up close?

47:07.392 --> 47:11.162
Shit, I'm sorry!
My fucking leg! I'm sorry!

47:11.196 --> 47:13.198
- Stop! Don't go! Please!
<i>Vamos. Vamos.</i>

47:13.231 --> 47:14.532
Please!
Don't fucking go! I'm sorry!

47:14.566 --> 47:16.367
How do you drive
this thing, bro?

47:16.401 --> 47:18.102
<i>They're on my fucking leg!</i>

47:18.136 --> 47:20.471
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, it's going backwards!

47:22.106 --> 47:23.942
The other way, <i>pendejo!</i>
The other way!

47:23.975 --> 47:25.043
<i>I think you ran him over!</i>

47:25.076 --> 47:26.377
Okay, okay, okay!
All right, all right.

47:26.411 --> 47:27.612
<i>Oh, okay, I got it.</i>

47:27.845 --> 47:29.180
<i>Okay, yeah.</i>

47:29.214 --> 47:30.848
Coño!

47:31.349 --> 47:34.052
<i>All right, beautiful. Nice!</i>

47:35.286 --> 47:36.521
Nice. I got it.

47:36.554 --> 47:38.189
Just like old times, <i>primo.</i>

47:39.457 --> 47:41.559
Yeah!
<i>Vamos!</i>

47:41.593 --> 47:43.161
Okay!

48:01.579 --> 48:03.281
- Hey.
- Hey.

48:11.122 --> 48:13.524
Wait a minute.
I want to mix a drink.

48:13.558 --> 48:15.126
Do you have
any cranberry juice?

48:16.094 --> 48:18.162
Cranberry, no. Um...

48:18.196 --> 48:19.430
Then I'll have it on the rocks.

48:19.464 --> 48:20.632
Okay.

48:32.443 --> 48:34.078
One?

48:34.112 --> 48:36.047
Two.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.382
No.

48:37.415 --> 48:39.450
- Hmm?

48:39.484 --> 48:41.419
Hold on, Abruzzo.

48:41.452 --> 48:43.554
Let me get myself settled.

48:43.588 --> 48:45.356
You want one?

48:47.525 --> 48:52.163
Oh, no, trust me, nothing...
good happens if I say yes.

48:52.196 --> 48:54.465
Hmm. What does that mean?

48:56.601 --> 48:58.436
Means I'm not a big drinker,
that's what it means.

48:58.469 --> 49:01.239
Well, I am.
- Okay.

49:01.272 --> 49:04.108
And I don't like
to drink alone, so...

49:06.144 --> 49:07.578
Come on.

49:10.715 --> 49:13.051
- Cheers.

49:25.396 --> 49:27.065
- Hey, Nick.
<i>Did I wake you?</i>

49:27.098 --> 49:29.500
No. No, no, no.
What's up? What's going on?

49:29.534 --> 49:32.537
<i>Look, you're still
a prick, but, um...</i>

49:32.570 --> 49:34.706
<i>if you want to buy me a slice
of pizza, I'll take it.</i>

49:35.707 --> 49:38.676
<i>Hello? Dad?</i>

49:38.710 --> 49:41.245
Yeah, no, I, um--
um, that sounds great.

49:41.279 --> 49:43.281
I would love that.
Can I call you later?

49:43.314 --> 49:45.183
<i>Yeah, cool.</i>
- Okay, bye.

49:59.764 --> 50:01.299
Oh, fuck.

50:16.681 --> 50:19.083
What's that noise?

50:19.117 --> 50:20.318
It's nothing, baby.

50:20.351 --> 50:21.719
<i>Go back to sleep.</i>

50:32.430 --> 50:33.431
Let's go.

50:35.500 --> 50:37.735
<i>Come on, ladies.
File into your cell.</i>

50:37.769 --> 50:40.638
Don't worry.

50:40.671 --> 50:42.373
You ain't miss nothing.

50:42.407 --> 50:44.308
Breakfast was fucking nasty.

50:48.646 --> 50:50.782
- Jesus! Fucking shit!

50:50.815 --> 50:53.451
Yo! Who the fuck did this?

50:53.484 --> 50:56.053
Who put this shit in my bed?

50:56.087 --> 50:58.322
I ain't no fucking rat!

50:59.590 --> 51:01.759
Yo, you been in here
all morning.

51:01.793 --> 51:03.494
How the fuck
did that get in my bed?

51:03.528 --> 51:06.364
I told you,
I don't get involved.

51:23.514 --> 51:26.484
<i>Well,
your fucking tip paid off.</i>

51:26.517 --> 51:27.785
- Yeah.
<i>But how are we</i>

51:27.819 --> 51:30.455
<i>supposed to ID with no head
and no hands?</i>

51:30.488 --> 51:32.690
I don't know.
That's your fucking problem.

51:45.803 --> 51:48.706
Hey, Sarge, what's up?

51:48.739 --> 51:51.108
