02:12.767 --> 02:14.467
Make Nick Carraway
So Dull?

02:14.467 --> 02:17.367
What's The Point Of Having
Such A Boring Narrator?

02:17.367 --> 02:19.501
I Think It Was
A Bad Choice.

02:19.501 --> 02:22.934
Well, Carraway Is
Like A Camera.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.667

03:52.334 --> 03:54.667
 <I>As A Result,</I>
 <I>We're Forced</I>

03:54.667 --> 03:55.868

We Have Decided

04:01.267 --> 04:03.000
We're Willing
To Recommend You

04:03.000 --> 04:04.300
For Positions Elsewhere.

For Some Time Now

04:10.033 --> 04:11.934

To Manhattan.

04:15.033 --> 04:18.000
Perhaps Now Would
Be A Good Time

04:18.000 --> 04:19.901
For A Big Change
Like That.

04:19.901 --> 04:21.767
Yes, Louis.
I Think Manhattan

04:21.767 --> 04:23.734
Sounds Like
A Very Fitting Place

 <I>Crushing Dismissal,</I>

04:32.901 --> 04:37.167
 <I>Louis Ives Had No Courage</I>
 <I>For Such Bold Moves.</I>

04:37.167 --> 04:40.701
 <I>For The Brassiere Incident</I>
 <I>Had Crippled Him.</I>

04:40.701 --> 04:44.367

 <I> These Strange Urges...</I>
- <I>( HORN HONKS )</I>

04:44.367 --> 04:46.734
 <I>...But In Moments Of Weakness</I>

 <I>They Demanded Attention.</I>

04:50.200 --> 04:53.000

04:56.901 --> 05:00.067
 <I>He Wore These Rituals</I>
 <I>Like Armor</I>

05:00.067 --> 05:02.634
 <I>To Shield Him</I>
 <I>From Despair.</I>

05:02.634 --> 05:06.367
 <I>But In Louis Ives'</I>
 <I>Darkest Moments,</I>

05:06.367 --> 05:08.968
 <I>He Feared</I>
 <I>He Was Unlovable.</I>

05:11.868 --> 05:13.734
 <I>It Was The Changing</I>
 <I>Of Leaves</I>

05:13.734 --> 05:16.367

- So Tell Me...

Why Are You Moving
To New York?

07:44.234 --> 07:45.634
( CLEARS THROAT )

07:45.634 --> 07:47.234
I'm Sort Of Looking
For Myself.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.033
You Won't Find Yourself
In New York.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.400
If I Had To Move Anywhere,
I'd Move To Russia.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.934
 <I>Far Less Expensive.</I>

07:52.934 --> 07:55.701
Well, I've Been Teaching
Now For Several Years,

07:55.701 --> 07:58.033
So As Far As The Rent
Is Concerned,

07:58.033 --> 07:59.267
I've Saved Enough

07:59.267 --> 08:00.334
From Working
In Princeton--

08:00.334 --> 08:01.667
Princeton?!

08:01.667 --> 08:04.167
How Is Princeton
These Days?

08:04.167 --> 08:07.367
It Was Great Once,
But Then They Let Women In.

08:07.367 --> 08:10.033
Oh, You Mean
The University.

08:10.033 --> 08:12.400
It's Still Excellent.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.901
And There's No Reason Women
Shouldn't Go To College.

08:14.901 --> 08:16.467
I'm Against
The Education Of Women.

08:17.667 --> 08:19.000
( LAUGHS )

08:19.000 --> 08:20.501
It Dulls Their Senses

08:20.501 --> 08:22.534
And Affects Their
Performance In The Boudoir.

08:22.534 --> 08:25.100

Are The Hasidic Women.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.267

08:32.366 --> 08:34.701
- I Teach Composition
At Queens College.
- Oh.

08:34.701 --> 08:36.366
Primarily,
I'm A Playwright.

08:36.366 --> 08:39.868

Have I Seen
Any Of Your Work?

08:39.868 --> 08:43.967
Sadly My Great Opus Was
Stolen By A Swiss Hunchback,

08:43.967 --> 08:46.200

To Go Into Now.

12:10.701 --> 12:12.334
Tell Me
Your Name Again.

12:12.334 --> 12:14.234
Louis.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.434
My Name's Louis.

12:15.434 --> 12:17.601
Don't Worry,
It Will Eventually Sink In.

12:17.601 --> 12:19.968
I'm Glad To See You've
Moved In So Nicely.

12:19.968 --> 12:23.234
I Apologize That Gershon
Couldn't Help Carry
Your Things.

12:23.234 --> 12:24.667
He's Not Speaking To Me.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.734
That's Fine.
Who's Gershon?

12:26.734 --> 12:28.601
He's A Friend
Who Helps Carry Things.

12:28.601 --> 12:30.133
And Fix My Car.

12:30.133 --> 12:33.200
Speaking Of Which,
I Was Admiring Yours Earlier.
What Make Is That?

12:33.200 --> 12:36.734
Oh, It's
A Pontiac Grand Ville.

12:36.734 --> 12:38.734
It Was My Father's.

12:38.734 --> 12:39.934
In A Weird Way,

12:39.934 --> 12:42.367
It's Sort Of All
I Have Left Of Him.

12:42.367 --> 12:45.067
He Died My Freshman Year
Of College.

12:45.067 --> 12:49.434
My Mother Passed
Only A Few Years After.

12:49.434 --> 12:52.100
Well...

12:52.100 --> 12:53.267
I Drive A Buick.

12:53.267 --> 12:56.167
- Hmm.
- What Are You
Reading There?

12:56.167 --> 12:57.400
Henry James.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.033
He's Unreadable.

12:59.033 --> 13:00.868
 <I>His Early Work</I>
 <I>Wasn't As Bad.</I>

13:00.868 --> 13:02.434
He Burned Himself,
You Know?

13:02.434 --> 13:05.334
He Sat On A Stove
And Shriveled His Testicles.

13:05.334 --> 13:09.400
That May Account
For His Sudden Change
Of Style.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.200
I Didn't Know That.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.334
Yes. Well, You'd Better
Get Some Rest.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.634
I Imagine You're
Still Growing.

 <I>Yeah! </I>

 <I>( GRUNTING CONTINUING )</I>

13:43.033 --> 13:45.200
Ahhh.
Ow.

13:49.334 --> 13:51.033
Ahh!

13:51.033 --> 13:53.667
Go! No!
Go Back!

13:53.667 --> 13:54.868
- <I>Back To Your Room.</I>
- No--

13:54.868 --> 13:56.868
I Don't Like You Lurking
There In The Shadows.

13:56.868 --> 13:59.767
I'm Sorry, Henry!
I Just Didn't Know 
What Was Happening.

13:59.767 --> 14:02.434
I Can't Be Seen
When I'm Dancing!

14:02.434 --> 14:04.267
 <I>I Forgot You Were Here.</I>

14:04.267 --> 14:07.234
 <I>Next Time I Exercise,</I>
 <I>I'll Make Sure That You're Out.</I>

14:07.234 --> 14:09.701
But Sometimes
The Need Is Too Great!

14:09.701 --> 14:12.834
- No Problem.
- One Must Keep In Shape,
You Know?

14:12.834 --> 14:16.868
I Try To Move Whatever
I Think Is Rotting.

14:22.934 --> 14:24.634
I Tell You, Louis,

14:24.634 --> 14:26.367
I'd Like To Hire You.

14:26.367 --> 14:29.434
For Now It's Gonna Be
Mostly Be Phone Sales

14:29.434 --> 14:31.467
 <I>To Businesses</I>
 <I>And To Museums.</I>

14:31.467 --> 14:33.901
But It Does Go
Without Saying--

This Being

14:35.868 --> 14:37.167
You Are Green?

14:40.033 --> 14:41.033
 <I>Yes.</I>

14:41.033 --> 14:43.634
- Yes, Of Course.
- Good.

14:43.634 --> 14:46.601
I'm Very Environmental.

14:46.601 --> 14:48.734
I'm Always Thinking

14:48.734 --> 14:51.767
About How The World
Is Falling Apart.

14:51.767 --> 14:55.534
And Then
I Get Depressed

14:55.534 --> 14:57.167
And I Think About--

14:57.167 --> 14:59.334
Well, If I Think
About Myself

14:59.334 --> 15:00.467
 <I>That's Also Depressing.</I>

15:00.467 --> 15:01.767
- Good.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.701
- Yeah?
- Sorry To Interrupt,
George,

15:05.701 --> 15:08.467
But I Need You To Look
At These Right Away

15:08.467 --> 15:10.334
So I Can Get
Them Scanned.

15:10.334 --> 15:11.267
Okay.

15:13.968 --> 15:15.701
 <I>Oh, She's Got</I>
 <I>Nice Feathers.</I>

15:16.834 --> 15:19.267
But I Like Her Eyes.
This Is The One.

15:19.267 --> 15:21.367
- Great.
- <I>I Agree.</I>

15:21.367 --> 15:23.434
That's An Excellent
Owl Photo.

15:23.434 --> 15:26.167
Mary, This Is Louis.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.167
 <I>Louis Is Going</I>
 <I>To Be Working Here.</I>

15:28.167 --> 15:30.601
- Nice To Meet You.
- How Do You Do?

15:30.601 --> 15:32.934
You Didn't Have
To Get Up.

15:32.934 --> 15:35.501
I Look Forward
To Working With You, Mary.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.067
And With You, George.

15:37.067 --> 15:39.834
- Thank You For Taking Me On.
- You're Welcome, Louis.

15:39.834 --> 15:42.834
Let's Get You Filling Out
Some Start Papers, Huh?

15:55.801 --> 15:57.367
Come On.

15:59.067 --> 16:00.067

16:05.067 --> 16:06.300
Oh, Hey.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.200
Let Me Help You
With That, Henry.

16:08.200 --> 16:11.167
What Service.

16:11.167 --> 16:14.601
You'd Make An Excellent
Valet Or Squire.

16:14.601 --> 16:17.334
Henry, Maybe Next Time

16:17.334 --> 16:20.133
We Should Try And Recycle
Your Wine Bottles.

16:20.133 --> 16:21.133
Why?

16:21.133 --> 16:23.434
Recycling Is
The Most Insidious Idea

16:23.434 --> 16:24.567
Of This Generation.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.067
That And Helping
The Homeless,

 <I>Most Of Whom Deserve</I>
 <I>The Position.</I>

16:27.934 --> 16:31.567
What The Government Should
Really Focus On Is Sex.

16:31.567 --> 16:33.667
 <I>If We Could</I>
 <I>Control That,</I>

16:33.667 --> 16:36.000
We Could Solve Anything.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.367
So You See Sex

16:37.367 --> 16:39.901
As The Cause Of All
Of Society's Problems?

16:39.901 --> 16:42.868
Absolutely.
You'll Find I'm
To The Right Of The Pope

16:42.868 --> 16:44.701
On Most Of These Issues.

16:44.701 --> 16:46.501
Well, Anyway,

16:46.501 --> 16:48.067
If I May Change
The Subject,

16:48.067 --> 16:51.234
You Look Very Nice.
Are You Going Out Somewhere?

16:51.234 --> 16:53.133
Yes, I'm Seeing

16:56.033 --> 16:59.234
She Phoned Me
About An Event
Only 10 Minutes Ago,

16:59.234 --> 17:01.968
But The Queen
Must Be Obeyed.

17:01.968 --> 17:05.032
- Wow, A Billionairess.
- Mmm.

17:05.032 --> 17:07.701
And To Think
A Lowly Fellow Like Me

17:07.701 --> 17:09.800
Was About To Treat You
To Dinner.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.934
I Had A Banner Day.
I Even Got A Job.

17:12.934 --> 17:14.467
Congratulations!

17:14.467 --> 17:17.334
I Knew You Were A Man
Who Could Pay The Rent.

17:17.334 --> 17:18.968
What Type Of Position?

17:18.968 --> 17:20.834
- It's At A Magazine.
- Mmm.

17:20.834 --> 17:22.934
An Environmental Journal.

17:22.934 --> 17:25.233
I'm Sure It's
All Just A Front
For Pornography.

17:25.233 --> 17:28.334
- ( HORN HONKS )
- Ah, This Is My Ride.

17:28.334 --> 17:31.701

17:32.901 --> 17:34.567
I'll Take You
To The Opera.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.701
I Know A Wonderful
Little Company.

17:36.701 --> 17:38.167

- This Way.
- Woman: <I>Excuse Me.</I>

17:55.667 --> 17:58.300
Excuse Me, I Had
My Eye On That First.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.901
The Doorman Was Watching
This Pile For Me.

18:00.901 --> 18:04.100
Henry:
Bloody Hell, I Forgot It
Was Trash Day.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.367
Oh, Well.

18:05.367 --> 18:07.734
Are You Sure About Going
To The Opera Tonight?

18:07.734 --> 18:09.901
I Hear It's
Astronomically Expensive.

18:09.901 --> 18:12.834
Don't-- Don't Be
So Middle-Class.

18:12.834 --> 18:15.934

Never Pays.

- Why?

I Go Everywhere
In My Electra.

18:29.801 --> 18:31.300
I Drive All
Around Manhattan

18:31.300 --> 18:32.634
Looking For "It."

18:32.634 --> 18:35.434
I Mean "It"
In The Kerouac Sense.

18:35.434 --> 18:37.033
Why Do You Have
Florida Plates?

18:37.033 --> 18:38.534
Because I Live There
Part-Time--

18:38.534 --> 18:40.534
Palm Beach.

18:40.534 --> 18:42.501
 <I>That's Where</I>
 <I>The Social Life Goes</I>
 <I>In The Winter.</I>

18:45.167 --> 18:47.467
I Can Only Afford

18:47.467 --> 18:50.501
Just Close It
Tightly Behind You.

18:53.834 --> 18:55.334
- Please, Be Careful!
- Ohh!

18:55.334 --> 18:57.701
You Don't Even Have
Any Seat Belts In This Thing.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.868
Don't Be Such A Milquetoast.
As Napoleon Said,

18:59.868 --> 19:01.167
- "If Rape Is Imminent..."
- Henry!

- "...Relax And Enjoy It!"
- Woman: <I>Asshole!</I>

19:03.834 --> 19:06.234
All Right,
Here's How It's Done.

19:06.234 --> 19:07.868
The Intermission Is
About To Begin.

19:07.868 --> 19:09.534
So When You See Somebody
Coming Out,

19:09.534 --> 19:11.868
You Simply Say,
"Oh, Are You Leaving So Soon?

19:11.868 --> 19:13.334
Well, If You Are,

19:13.334 --> 19:16.334
May I Have Your Ticket
And Your Re-Entry Stub?"

19:16.334 --> 19:19.033
Now, You Have
To Get The Re-Entry Stub.
That's Very Important.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.667
Without It,
The Ticket Is Useless.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.200
- Do You Understand?
- I Think So.

19:24.267 --> 19:26.901
Henry, Henry!
I Got Two Tickets!

19:26.901 --> 19:29.467
Shh, Shh.
And The Re-Entry Stubs?

19:29.467 --> 19:31.100
Well, One Stub,
But I Think--

19:31.100 --> 19:34.100
Didn't I Tell You
It Was Crucial To Get
The Re-Entry Stub?

19:34.100 --> 19:35.801
Which Part Of That
Didn't You Understand?

19:35.801 --> 19:38.534
She Only Took One.
Why Are You Yelling At Me?!

19:38.534 --> 19:40.200
- You Didn't Get Anything.
- That's Irrelevant.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.968
The Point Is
Without The Re-Entry Stub

19:41.968 --> 19:43.734
The Ticket Is Useless.

19:43.734 --> 19:46.033
- <I>( MUSICAL TONES PLAY )</I>

To Try To Sneak In.

All Right.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.334
Here's A Program.
That Will Help.

19:55.334 --> 19:57.200
You Go First,
I'll Be Behind You.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.734
I'll Be Senile,
You'll Be Angry.

19:58.734 --> 20:00.100
We'll Bluff
Our Way In. Go.

20:06.968 --> 20:10.067
Where Is--
Where's My Re-Entry Stub?
I Had It.

20:10.067 --> 20:12.667
Did You Take It?
I Hand It To You?

20:12.667 --> 20:14.667
- No.
- I Must Have Handed
It To You.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.400
No, You Didn't,
Father!

20:16.400 --> 20:19.367
For Heaven's Sake,
Try To Remember Where
You Put Things!

20:19.367 --> 20:21.601
Did You Check
Your Pants?

20:21.601 --> 20:23.601
- I'm Wearing Them!
- Just Go In.

20:23.601 --> 20:26.234
Thank You.
Terribly Sorry 
About All That.

20:26.234 --> 20:27.601
That's Not Bad.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.534
With A Bit
Of Direction
From Me,

20:29.534 --> 20:31.667
You Could Land Yourself
A Walk-On Part Somewhere.

20:31.667 --> 20:32.801
Perhaps Off Broadway.

Produce Women Like That.

 <I>So There We Are.</I>

20:57.767 --> 21:00.200
Where Are We?

21:00.200 --> 21:01.567
Sorry?

I Like To Say That
Sometimes Before Retiring.

21:09.734 --> 21:12.601
Any Final Thoughts,
Questions?

21:12.601 --> 21:15.133
Yes. Can We Go
To The Opera Again Soon?

21:15.133 --> 21:17.467
Why Not?
We Can Afford It.

21:17.467 --> 21:20.334
Oh, Henry,
One More Thing.

21:20.334 --> 21:24.033
I Never Got To Ask You,
How Did Your Evening

21:24.033 --> 21:25.901
With The Billionairess Go?

21:25.901 --> 21:27.667
With Vivian?
It Was Fine.

21:27.667 --> 21:30.067
Except She Stopped Breathing
For A Full Minute.

21:30.067 --> 21:32.601
But Then She Rallied.
She Always Does.

21:32.601 --> 21:34.234
How Old Is She?

21:34.234 --> 21:36.901
She's 92.

21:36.901 --> 21:38.801
- 92?!
- <I>Yes.</I>

21:38.801 --> 21:41.968
That's A Little Old
For A Girlfriend,

21:41.968 --> 21:43.167
Don't You Think?

21:43.167 --> 21:45.667
Unfortunately,
She's Not My Girlfriend.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.133
Henry...

22:11.200 --> 22:12.434
Are You A Gigolo?

22:12.434 --> 22:14.200
Don't Be Disgusting.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.033
I Am An "Extra Man."

22:16.033 --> 22:19.334
Although I Would Argue
I'm So Much More Than "Extra."

22:19.334 --> 22:20.767
 <I>I'm Essential.</I>

22:20.767 --> 22:23.234
Do These Old Ladies
Pay You?

22:23.234 --> 22:24.968
Of Course Not,
Except In Pleasure--

22:24.968 --> 22:27.801
 <I>A Fine Meal,</I>

22:27.801 --> 22:29.367
 <I>Vintage Champagne...</I>

22:30.601 --> 22:32.400
 <I>An Orchestra Perhaps.</I>

22:33.968 --> 22:37.033
 <I>You See,</I>
 <I>Women Outlive Men,</I>

22:37.033 --> 22:38.701
 <I>So There's Always A Need</I>

22:38.701 --> 22:40.901
 <I>For An Extra Man</I>
 <I>At The Table.</I>

22:40.901 --> 22:43.934
 <I>It Maintains A Proper</I>
 <I>Seating Arrangement.</I>

22:43.934 --> 22:45.901
 <I>Boy-Girl, Boy-Girl.</I>

22:45.901 --> 22:47.467
 <I>But Don't Think</I>
 <I>For A Moment</I>

22:47.467 --> 22:50.033
 <I>That It's All Champagne</I>
 <I>And Stardust.</I>

22:50.033 --> 22:54.100
 <I>An Extra Man Must Be</I>
 <I>Extremely Vigilant,</I>

22:54.100 --> 22:56.067
 <I>Especially When Dancing.</I>

22:56.067 --> 22:59.167
 <I>That's Why Escorts Are</I>
 <I>Often Called Walkers.</I>

22:59.167 --> 23:02.868
 <I>I, However,</I>
 <I>Am No Mere Walker.</I>

23:02.868 --> 23:05.300
 <I>What I Bring Is</I>
 <I>The Complete Package--</I>

23:05.300 --> 23:08.801
Wit, Intelligence,

23:08.801 --> 23:11.234
 <I>An Uncommon</I>
Joie De Vivre.

23:11.234 --> 23:13.334
I Wish I Had
 <I>Joie De Vivre.</I>

23:13.334 --> 23:15.834
 <I>Then I Could</I>
 <I>Be Your Assistant.</I>

23:15.834 --> 23:17.334
You're Very Young.

23:17.334 --> 23:20.501
 <I>But Vivian Does Have</I>
 <I>A Rather Attractive Niece.</I>

23:20.501 --> 23:23.200
- She Might Like You.
- That Would Be Incredible.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.534
Are We Having
A Conversation?

23:25.534 --> 23:28.133
Yes, I'd Say So.

23:28.133 --> 23:29.467
Well, It Has To Stop.

23:29.467 --> 23:31.801
We Should Know As Little
About Each Other As Possible.

23:31.801 --> 23:34.234
 <I>Good Relationships</I>
 <I>Have This Foundation.</I>

23:34.234 --> 23:35.834
 <I>Now Good Night.</I>

23:38.901 --> 23:40.767
Good Night, Henry.

23:49.567 --> 23:51.067
( CLEARS THROAT )
Hi, Mary.

23:52.133 --> 23:53.434
Oh, Hi.

23:55.734 --> 23:58.300
I See You're Eating
In Today Too.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.167
 <I>Yeah, I'm Really Behind.</I>

24:00.167 --> 24:02.934
- What Did You Get?
- Zen Palate.

24:02.934 --> 24:06.334
Ah, Are You
A Vegetarian?

24:06.334 --> 24:07.601
- Vegan.
- Ah.

24:07.601 --> 24:09.801
I'm Really Active
In Animal Rights.

24:09.801 --> 24:13.100
Oh, I Wish
I Could Be Vegan,

24:13.100 --> 24:16.234
But I Really Like Eggs.

24:16.234 --> 24:19.701
Although I Do Try To Order
Only Free-Range Chicken.

24:19.701 --> 24:20.701
 <I>( ELEVATOR BELL RINGS )</I>

24:20.701 --> 24:24.000
So I Went To The Opera
Last Night.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.234
- That's Cool.
- It Was Amazing, Actually.

24:27.234 --> 24:29.334
I'm Pretty
Opera Illiterate,
Sorry To Say.

24:29.334 --> 24:32.467
Well, Maybe I Could
Take You Some Time.

24:32.467 --> 24:34.667
I Know How
To Get In For Free.

24:36.067 --> 24:39.400
Or We Could Just Go
For A Drink Somewhere
One Night.

24:39.400 --> 24:42.200
Maybe Even This Weekend?

24:42.200 --> 24:44.667
Thanks, Louis,

24:44.667 --> 24:46.567
But I'm Going
Out Of Town This Weekend.

24:46.567 --> 24:47.968
- Oh.
- We're Protesting
The Building

24:47.968 --> 24:50.467
Of A Cement Plant
On The Hudson.

24:50.467 --> 24:54.100
Actually, This Guy
I Started Seeing
Is Taking Me.

24:54.100 --> 24:57.501
Maybe You And I Could
Grab Lunch Out Together
One Day.

24:58.934 --> 25:00.667
- Okay?
- Sure.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.534
Thank You.

25:15.100 --> 25:16.400
Eww.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.534
I'm Sorry.
I'm Sorry.

25:18.534 --> 25:19.701
Sorry.
I'm Sorry.

Hello.

Um, It's Okay.

26:24.634 --> 26:27.501
If I'm Too Old,
You Can Just Turn
Around And Go.

26:27.501 --> 26:29.968
No, No.
You're Fine, Ma'am.

26:29.968 --> 26:31.501
More Than Fine, I Mean.

26:31.501 --> 26:34.000
All Right.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.434
Well,
Come On In Then.

26:38.701 --> 26:40.234
So I'm Katherine,

26:40.234 --> 26:43.300
But You Can Call Me
Miss Hart.

What Was Your Name Again,
Sweetheart?

26:45.033 --> 26:46.767
George.

26:46.767 --> 26:48.200
George.

26:48.200 --> 26:51.601
All Right, Then We Will
Call You Georgina,

26:51.601 --> 26:54.534
Unless You're Not Interested
In The Crossdressing Part.

26:54.534 --> 26:57.501
No, I Am.
That's Really
Why I Called.

26:57.501 --> 26:59.501
Have You Dressed Up A Lot?

26:59.501 --> 27:02.200
 <I>No, Hardly At All.</I>

It's Weird.
I Don't Really Have

Talk To About...

This Urge.

- <I>( TIMER CLICKING )</I>

You Tell Miss Hart
Everything.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.367
Here, Have A Seat.

27:17.367 --> 27:18.834
Okay.

27:18.834 --> 27:24.534
Well, I Think
It All Started

27:24.534 --> 27:26.234
When I Was A Little Boy.

27:26.234 --> 27:29.734
I Saw This Cartoon

27:29.734 --> 27:32.901
Where A Duck
Wearing A Tuxedo

27:32.901 --> 27:36.100
Was Transformed
Into A Beautiful Girl.

27:36.100 --> 27:39.100
 <I>Seeing That Stirred</I>
 <I>Something In Me.</I>

27:50.667 --> 27:52.734
Soon After,
I Discovered A Book.

27:54.334 --> 27:58.267
 <I>I Worried I Might Be Like</I>
 <I>The People Described In It.</I>

27:58.267 --> 28:01.300
Over The Years,
I've Had Very Few Lovers--

28:01.300 --> 28:03.400
And You're Lonely.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.367
And You Desire
The Company Of A Woman.

28:05.367 --> 28:07.133
And You Know What,

28:07.133 --> 28:10.267
That's As Good A Reason
As Any To Start Crossdressing.

28:10.267 --> 28:13.701
So Let's Get You Into Some
Lingerie, Sweetheart.

28:15.133 --> 28:17.067

28:23.467 --> 28:25.701
 <I>You Look Very Nice.</I>

28:25.701 --> 28:27.934
Okay.

28:27.934 --> 28:32.434
So The First Thing
We Have To Do

28:32.434 --> 28:34.701
Is Teach You
To Be Feminine.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.000
First, You're
Gonna Learn How To Sit.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.434
Go Ahead.

28:42.634 --> 28:44.801
No No No No.
Okay.

28:44.801 --> 28:47.567
See How Your Foot Is
Pointed Up Like That,

28:47.567 --> 28:49.701
All Tense And Full
Of Aggression?

28:49.701 --> 28:51.334
A Man's Foot
Does That

28:51.334 --> 28:53.501
Because They're Always
Trying To Get Somewhere.

28:53.501 --> 28:55.901
Try Relaxing
Your Foot Down.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.400
Relax. Good.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.267
That Indicates That You're
Open To A Man's Advances.

29:00.267 --> 29:03.901
- That's Not What I'm After.
- Don't Interrupt, Georgina,

29:03.901 --> 29:05.467
It's Rude!

29:06.934 --> 29:08.767
Maybe It's Time
For Your Spanking.

29:08.767 --> 29:12.667
- We Don't Have To Do That.
- Yeah, We Do. Get Up!

29:12.667 --> 29:14.634
- Put Yourself
Across My Knee.
- Okay.

29:15.701 --> 29:17.601
- You Bad Boy!
- Whoa!

- Talking Back!

Like A Lie.

Oh, Speaking Of Which,
I Forgot To Mention This--

Never Answer The Door.

Oh. How Long Did
He Live Here?

31:16.701 --> 31:19.033
Two Years.
It Was A Great Mistake.

31:19.033 --> 31:20.868
At First It Wasn't Awful.

31:20.868 --> 31:23.968
He Looked Like
Sophia Loren In Profile.

He Had A Hunchback.

31:28.934 --> 31:30.968
You're Putting The Mail
In The Freezer?

31:30.968 --> 31:33.200
Only His Letters.
I Can't Afford To Lose Them.

On Revenge Against Me.

31:36.934 --> 31:38.334
Why?

31:38.334 --> 31:41.400
- Because I Kicked Him Out.
- Really?

For Being
A Sexual Deviant.

31:43.434 --> 31:44.834
Oh.

31:44.834 --> 31:49.133
He Had One Of Those

31:54.167 --> 31:55.200

Can You Believe
He's Actually Living

31:59.133 --> 32:01.601
With Vivian Cudlip's
Granddaughter?

32:01.601 --> 32:03.400
And What Is Worse,

He Stole The Only Copy

Citing These Great Authors.

Of Unusual Kinks.

33:45.534 --> 33:49.868
 <I>( MAN SINGING )</I>
 <I>* Beautiful Dreamer </I>

33:49.868 --> 33:53.667
 <I>* Wake Unto Me... </I>

33:53.667 --> 33:56.334
Narrator:
 <I>But As The Day</I>
 <I>Progressed,</I>

33:56.334 --> 33:58.634
 <I>The Oddness Of Life</I>

33:58.634 --> 34:00.667
 <I>Once Again</I>
 <I>Distracted Him.</I>

34:02.501 --> 34:06.033
 <I>* Sounds</I>
 <I>Of The Rude World *</I>

34:06.033 --> 34:09.033
 <I>* Heard In The Day </I>

34:09.033 --> 34:12.701
 <I>* Lulled By The Moonlight </I>

34:12.701 --> 34:16.400
 <I>* Have All Passed Away. </I>

34:23.132 --> 34:25.567
Henry,
Do You Know That Man?

34:27.601 --> 34:29.067
Henry:
 <I>That's Gershon Gruen.</I>

34:29.067 --> 34:31.634
 <I>Oh, Your Friend</I>
 <I>Who Carries Things?</I>

34:31.634 --> 34:33.501
 <I>Yes, And Fixes My Car.</I>

34:33.501 --> 34:36.067
It's Obvious He's Still
Not Speaking To Me.

34:36.067 --> 34:37.900
He's Always
On That Bike.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.833
Yes, He's Cycling Away
His Sex Drive.

34:40.833 --> 34:44.434
Gershon Was A Slave
To His Libido.

34:44.434 --> 34:46.934
He Used To Bring Prostitutes
From The Bronx

34:46.934 --> 34:48.367
Into His Apartment,

34:48.367 --> 34:49.634
And They Would
Steal Things.

34:49.634 --> 34:51.900
He Couldn't Stop,
So He Turned To Me For Help.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.400
I Told Him To Develop
Other Interests,

34:53.400 --> 34:56.100
Like Reading The Dictionary
To Improve His Vocabulary

34:56.100 --> 34:57.501
And Bicycle Riding,

34:57.501 --> 34:59.734
Which So Far
Has Worked Wonders.

34:59.734 --> 35:02.100
Of Course, He's Still
An Obsessive Masturbator.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.968
If Your Advice Worked,

35:04.968 --> 35:07.167
Then Why Isn't
He Speaking To You?

35:07.167 --> 35:10.634
He Claims That I Don't
Really Want His Friendship,

35:10.634 --> 35:13.100
That I Am Only Using Him
For His Mechanic Skills.

35:13.100 --> 35:15.133
Also, I Think He Was Jealous
Of My Relationship

35:15.133 --> 35:17.734
With Your Predecessor
Otto Bellman.

35:17.734 --> 35:22.601
You Have A Strange Power
Over People, Henry.

35:22.601 --> 35:25.100
It's My Constant
Disapproval.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.367
Some Find It Fatherly.

35:27.367 --> 35:29.667
No! Enough!

35:30.834 --> 35:33.133
I Think It's Silly
You Made Us Sit

35:33.133 --> 35:34.934
At Separate Tables
Like This.

35:34.934 --> 35:37.234
Men Of Any Worth
Sit Across From Women.

35:37.234 --> 35:39.501
If You Ever Want
To Be An Extra Man,

35:39.501 --> 35:42.100
You Have Much To Learn
About Boy-Girl Propriety.

35:42.100 --> 35:45.434
Which Reminds Me, What Are
You Doing Tomorrow Evening?

35:45.434 --> 35:47.367
Nothing. Why?

35:47.367 --> 35:49.868
I Have Two Lady Friends
Who Need Escorting To An Event.

35:51.767 --> 35:53.534
Vivian Cudlip
And Her Niece?

35:53.534 --> 35:55.834
No, But Almost
As Important.

35:55.834 --> 35:59.133
Would This Officially
Make Me An Extra Man?

35:59.133 --> 36:02.133
Extra, Yes.
But Nowhere Near Essential.

36:02.133 --> 36:03.934
 <I>( French MUSIC PLAYING )</I>

36:12.133 --> 36:13.667
Henry, What Are
You Doing?

36:13.667 --> 36:15.801
I Forgot To Buy Socks.

36:15.801 --> 36:17.434
Mine Are All
Threadbare.

36:17.434 --> 36:20.467
Don't Worry,
No One Will Notice.

36:20.467 --> 36:24.000
Who Knows, Maybe It'll
Help Kill The Fleas.

36:25.067 --> 36:26.801
Fleas?

36:26.801 --> 36:28.567
Yes. Fleas.

36:28.567 --> 36:30.501
My Dermatologist
Confirmed I Have Them.

36:32.434 --> 36:33.701
Henry:
 <I>Now Listen Carefully--</I>

36:33.701 --> 36:35.367
One Of The Women

36:35.367 --> 36:37.167
We're Escorting
This Evening, Lois Huber,

36:37.167 --> 36:39.701
Has Given Me A Room
In Her Palm Beach Home

36:39.701 --> 36:41.000
 <I>For The Last</I>
 <I>Four Seasons.</I>

36:41.000 --> 36:42.100
- Okay.
- Unfortunately,

36:42.100 --> 36:44.400
I Said Something
That Offended Her,

36:44.400 --> 36:46.000
 <I>And We Had</I>
 <I>A Falling Out.</I>

36:46.000 --> 36:47.567
What Did You Say
That Offended Her?

36:47.567 --> 36:49.601
I Told Her That Her
Ass Is Big,

36:49.601 --> 36:52.901
That She's A Saddle-Back
And Possibly A Moral Imbecile.

36:52.901 --> 36:55.801
Henry, That Seems Like
A Lot To Recover From.

36:55.801 --> 36:57.801
That's Where
I'm Counting On You.

36:57.801 --> 37:01.667
I'm Hoping That Your Youth
Will Have A Positive
Effect On Her.

37:02.801 --> 37:05.934
The Other Woman,
Meredith Lagerfeld,

37:05.934 --> 37:09.334
Has Nothing
To Offer Socially.
She's Dirt Poor.

37:09.334 --> 37:12.300
In Fact, We Often Work
In Unison At Events.

37:12.300 --> 37:15.667
She's The One Who Alerted Me
That Lois May Be Ready
To Forgive Me.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.367
- <I>That Was Nice Of Her.</I>
- Not Really.

37:17.367 --> 37:19.334
Lagerfeld Uses Me
For Rides.

37:19.334 --> 37:21.367
She's Gotten Quite Enormous,
You See,

37:21.367 --> 37:23.033
And Has Trouble Getting
Around Town.

37:23.033 --> 37:25.701
 <I>Speak Of The Devil.</I>

37:25.701 --> 37:27.501
 <I>My God, Look At Her.</I>

37:27.501 --> 37:30.801
She Does Have Nice Hair.

37:30.801 --> 37:32.567
 <I>I Suppose We All</I>
 <I>Have Something,</I>

37:32.567 --> 37:34.334
 <I>Even Lagerfeld.</I>

37:36.100 --> 37:38.200
Henry, Focus.

37:38.200 --> 37:41.434
The George Gillies
Have Just Arrived.

37:41.434 --> 37:44.100
She's Hosting Quite A Large
Party On Thursday.

37:44.100 --> 37:46.334
I Think We Should Try
To Speak To Her.

37:46.334 --> 37:48.200
They're Friends
Of Vivian Cudlip's.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.501
Mention The Name Vivian Cudlip
And We'll Be In.

37:50.501 --> 37:52.100
Meanwhile,
Where The Hell Is Lois?

37:52.100 --> 37:55.567
Oh, Lois, For Heaven's Sake.
She's Over By The Klimt.

37:55.567 --> 37:58.767
Hmm. Excuse Us.
Louis.

37:58.767 --> 38:00.868
Oh, Terribly Sorry.

38:08.834 --> 38:13.133
- There's A Dwarf
In That Picture.
- It's A Child, Henry.

38:13.133 --> 38:14.467
Yes, Quite Right.

38:14.467 --> 38:16.634
Speaking Of Children,
I'd Like To Introduce You

38:16.634 --> 38:19.234
To My Young House Guest
Louis Ives.

38:19.234 --> 38:22.434
Louis Has Recently Come
To New York To Find Himself.

38:22.434 --> 38:25.400
Lois, Louis,
Louis, Lois.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.767
Rolls Off The Tongue Rather
Nicely, Doesn't It?

38:30.801 --> 38:32.467
I Need Some More Wine.

38:38.634 --> 38:40.534
I Rea--
( CLEARS THROAT )

38:41.601 --> 38:44.000
I Really Like
These Paintings.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.234
I Don't.

38:45.234 --> 38:48.801
It's Ridiculous How Nobody
Really Looks At Them.

38:52.367 --> 38:55.834
I Was Admiring
Your Outfit Before.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.934
It's Very Interesting.

38:57.934 --> 39:00.701
And A Good Color
For You Too.

39:00.701 --> 39:04.033
And How Old
Are You, Louis?

39:04.033 --> 39:06.200
Old Enough.

39:06.200 --> 39:09.400
Tell Me, Are You
By Chance From Russia?

39:09.400 --> 39:11.534
Me?
( CHUCKLES )

39:11.534 --> 39:13.868
God, No.
I'm As American
As They Come.

39:15.367 --> 39:16.901
Not To Me.

39:18.200 --> 39:21.834
What Exactly Do You Do
With Magazines, Louis?

39:21.834 --> 39:24.701
I Work On The Marketing
Side Of Things,

39:24.701 --> 39:27.267
But I'd Like
To Be An Editor

39:27.267 --> 39:28.901
Or Writer Someday.

39:28.901 --> 39:32.200
Ah. Henry's
An Excellent Writer.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.467
A Talented Playwright.

39:33.467 --> 39:35.834
But He Can Be
A Very Rude Man,
You Know.

39:35.834 --> 39:38.200
- Ah.
- Meredith: Hello, Lois.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.434
With The Exception
Of That Russian Bartendress,

39:40.434 --> 39:43.200
I've Never Experienced
A More Dreary Crowd.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.167
Stop Complaining, Henry.
It's Tiresome.

39:46.167 --> 39:49.834
Well, There Is Another
Opening At The Whitney,

39:49.834 --> 39:51.734
But It's Not Until 9:00.

39:51.734 --> 39:53.767
Then I'll Need
Dinner First.

39:53.767 --> 39:57.267
We'll Eat At My Place.
Meredith Will Ride Over With Me,

39:57.267 --> 39:59.434
Henry And Louis Can Go
Pick Up The Food.

39:59.434 --> 40:01.033
- <I>Come, Dear.</I>
- That's Awfully Nice, Lois.

40:03.968 --> 40:06.267
 <I>Things With Lois Are Worse</I>
 <I>Than I Had Imagined.</I>

40:06.267 --> 40:08.467
Your Youth
Has Failed Us

40:08.467 --> 40:10.167
And I'm Off My Game.

40:10.167 --> 40:14.133
I Haven't Been Sleeping Right
Since My Eye Mask Disappeared.

40:14.133 --> 40:17.834
 <I>We'll Have No Choice</I>
 <I>But To Implement Plan B</I>
 <I>Over Dinner.</I>

40:17.834 --> 40:19.567
Next.

40:19.567 --> 40:22.000
There's No Bathroom In Here
And I Have To Piss.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.901
If I'm Not Back In Time,
Get Two Roasted Chickens.

40:24.901 --> 40:27.334
Lois Has Millions
Of Dollars,

40:27.334 --> 40:30.400
But There's Nothing
She Likes Better Than
Roasted Chicken.

40:32.634 --> 40:35.567
Narrator:
 <I>As The Young Gentleman</I>
 <I>Stood There On Line,</I>

40:35.567 --> 40:38.734
 <I>He Couldn't Help But Play</I>
 <I>The First Half Of The Evening</I>

40:38.734 --> 40:41.000
 <I>Over And Over</I>
 <I>In His Mind. </I>

40:41.000 --> 40:42.667
 <I>In Doing So,</I>

40:42.667 --> 40:44.734
 <I>Something Became</I>
 <I>Very Clear</I>

40:44.734 --> 40:47.067
 <I>About The Nature</I>
 <I>Of His Relationship</I>

40:47.067 --> 40:49.467
 <I>With Mr. Henry Harrison,</I>
 <I>Who--</I>

40:49.467 --> 40:50.968
- I'm Back.
- Oh.

40:50.968 --> 40:53.434
Did You Pee Already?

40:53.434 --> 40:55.501
- Yes.
- Where?

40:55.501 --> 40:57.400
Out There.

40:57.400 --> 40:58.934
Out In The Street?

40:58.934 --> 41:01.267
- Yes.
- No, You Didn't.

41:01.267 --> 41:03.767
Yes, I Did, Louis.

41:03.767 --> 41:07.434
A True Aristocrat Knows
That He Can Piss In The Street

41:07.434 --> 41:10.334
At Any Time He Wishes
Day Or Night.

41:10.334 --> 41:11.667
 <I>Next.</I>

41:11.667 --> 41:14.601
Henry, I Want To See
Where You Peed.

41:16.234 --> 41:17.567
Don't Be Ridiculous.

41:17.567 --> 41:19.100
Right There,
Between The Cars.

41:19.100 --> 41:22.300
How Did You Do It
Without Being Seen?

41:22.300 --> 41:23.834
You Could Have
Been Arrested.

41:25.534 --> 41:27.667
It's An Acquired Art.

41:27.667 --> 41:30.567
Look, I'll Show You.

41:31.968 --> 41:35.167
Now Watch,
And Do As I Do.

41:36.834 --> 41:38.534
Ready?

41:38.534 --> 41:41.834
Step Off The Curb
As If You're Going
To Walk Across The Street.

41:41.834 --> 41:43.868
Then You Stop Abruptly,

41:43.868 --> 41:45.267
Thinking Twice
About Crossing In Traffic.

41:45.267 --> 41:46.968
Meanwhile,
You've Undone
Your Zipper,

41:46.968 --> 41:48.367
You've Freed Yourself

41:48.367 --> 41:51.200
And Then,
Keeping A Wide Arc
With The Raincoat,

41:51.200 --> 41:53.300
You Step Backwards,
You See?

41:53.300 --> 41:56.601
This Way, No One Can
See You're Pissing,

41:56.601 --> 41:58.901
And The Walking
Backwards Part

41:58.901 --> 42:01.334
Keeps You From Pissing
On Your Legs,

42:01.334 --> 42:03.000
Not To Mention
Stepping In It.

42:04.701 --> 42:08.000
Oh, I Just Did
A Bit More.

42:09.334 --> 42:11.100
So Now Do You
Understand?

42:12.534 --> 42:16.200
I Think
I Actually Do. Yeah.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.267
Thank You
For Teaching Me That.

42:18.267 --> 42:20.467
You're Welcome.
And Keep The Change.

42:20.467 --> 42:22.501
 <I>Don't Mention It.</I>

42:22.501 --> 42:25.534
- Good Evening.
- Henry Harrison
For Mrs. Hueber.

42:25.534 --> 42:26.501
Of Course.

42:27.901 --> 42:29.434
Wow.

42:35.701 --> 42:37.167
Whatever You Do,

42:37.167 --> 42:40.033
Don't Mention
The Fleas To Lois.

42:40.033 --> 42:42.701
If She Catches Them,
She'll Know They're From Me.

42:42.701 --> 42:44.834
Then I'll Never
Get That Room.

42:44.834 --> 42:47.234
 <I>Ma'am,</I>
 <I>Mr. Harrison.</I>

42:47.234 --> 42:48.834
Wait. Wait.

42:48.834 --> 42:50.734
Lois Has A Dog.

42:50.734 --> 42:54.033
If I Can Transfer
My Fleas To Her Dog,

42:54.033 --> 42:55.834
- We'll Be Saved.
- <I>( ELEVATOR BELL RINGS )</I>

42:55.834 --> 42:56.801
Doorman:
 <I>Going Up?</I>

42:58.067 --> 42:59.834
- ( BARKING )
- <I>Lovie!</I>

42:59.834 --> 43:04.501
Oh, What A Good Girl.
Oh, I've Missed You!

43:04.501 --> 43:06.701
Look At You
With Your Little--

43:06.701 --> 43:08.567
What The Hell
Is That On You?

43:08.567 --> 43:10.801
Looks Like
An Elizabethan Collar.

43:10.801 --> 43:12.634
Henry, Put The Dog Down

43:12.634 --> 43:14.200
And Bring Me Those
Roasted Chickens.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.400
Right Away.
Right Away.

43:16.400 --> 43:17.868
- Put It Down, Henry!
- ( BARKS )

43:17.868 --> 43:19.501
I'm Coming.

43:21.634 --> 43:22.767
Oh.

43:27.367 --> 43:29.033
Hello, Meredith.

43:33.968 --> 43:35.501
Um...

43:38.734 --> 43:40.868
Wow.

43:40.868 --> 43:43.000
What An Amazing View.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.300
You Can See Everything
From Here.

43:45.300 --> 43:47.868
I Know. I Grew Up
In This Neighborhood.

43:49.467 --> 43:50.501
Did You Really?

43:52.200 --> 43:54.334
We Were The Most
Popular Family.

43:54.334 --> 43:57.334
 <I>Well, We Were Always</I>
 <I>Doing The Funnest Things.</I>

43:57.334 --> 44:01.400
We Never Had
A Dull Moment.

44:01.400 --> 44:05.434
 <I>I Thought All Families</I>
 <I>Were Like That.</I>

44:05.434 --> 44:08.200
I Thought Life
Would Be Like That.

44:11.467 --> 44:14.501
- Here We Are.
- I Don't Like The Dark Meat

44:14.501 --> 44:15.934
Touching The Light.

44:15.934 --> 44:17.868
Of Course Not.

44:17.868 --> 44:19.734
 <I>Did I Mention, Lois,</I>

44:19.734 --> 44:21.868
That I'll Be Having
A Staged Reading

44:21.868 --> 44:24.501
Of My George Eliot Play
This Winter In Palm Beach?

44:24.501 --> 44:28.367
Vivian Cudlip Has Secured
A Ballroom For Me In The Colony.

44:28.367 --> 44:29.834
Really, Henry?

44:29.834 --> 44:32.868
You're Planning To Be
In Palm Beach This Winter?

44:32.868 --> 44:34.534
Well, Of Course.

44:34.534 --> 44:37.801
And I Was Thinking
That You Would Be Perfect

44:37.801 --> 44:40.067
For The George Eliot Role.
What Do You Say?

44:40.067 --> 44:42.901
If You're Angling To Stay
In My Guest Room, Henry,

44:42.901 --> 44:45.400
I Can't Have You
This Season.

44:45.400 --> 44:48.100
I've Invited Meredith.

44:48.100 --> 44:51.801
I Think The Sun'll
Be Very Good For Her
Bad Knee, Don't You?

44:51.801 --> 44:54.701
- Lagerfeld?
- That's Correct.

44:54.701 --> 44:55.834
Meredith.

44:58.133 --> 44:59.834
( BANGING PLATE )

45:03.234 --> 45:06.467
This Roasted Chicken
Is Delicious.

45:09.367 --> 45:13.100
Henry, I Was Wondering
If You're Free Tomorrow.

45:13.100 --> 45:17.467
I Found An Inexpensive
Sports Doctor

45:17.467 --> 45:21.067
For My Knee 
In Brooklyn.

45:21.067 --> 45:23.167
( LAUGHING )

45:26.534 --> 45:29.767
I Was Wondering
If You Might Drive Me
To My Appointment?

45:29.767 --> 45:32.501
Find Someone Else.
I'm Teaching Tomorrow.

45:34.501 --> 45:36.334
I Don't Think
I Can Make It To
The Whitney Later Either.

45:36.334 --> 45:38.968
Every Exhibit Is The Same--

45:38.968 --> 45:41.167
Toilet Seats
And Sex Organs.

45:41.167 --> 45:44.601
I'm No Longer In The Mood
For That Sort Of Thing.

45:44.601 --> 45:48.601
Louis, We're Leaving.

45:48.601 --> 45:49.734
Now!

45:54.734 --> 45:57.534
I'm Sorry Things
Didn't Work Out Tonight.

45:59.200 --> 46:00.667
Right.

46:04.100 --> 46:06.000
( SIGHS HEAVILY )

46:06.000 --> 46:09.801
Thank You For Taking Me.
I Had A Very Nice Time
At The Gallery.

46:09.801 --> 46:11.267
The Whole Damned Evening

46:11.267 --> 46:12.901
Was Engineered
By Lagerfeld

46:12.901 --> 46:16.601
To Get Me To Drive Her
And Her Fat Knees
To Brooklyn.

46:16.601 --> 46:18.567
Of Course She's Not Going
To Ask Lois.

46:18.567 --> 46:21.000
She Wouldn't Do Anything
To Jeopardize That Room,

46:21.000 --> 46:23.367
Now That She's Got Her Grubby
Little Paws On It.

46:23.367 --> 46:25.200
Don't Dwell On It, Henry.

46:25.200 --> 46:27.467
Lets Try To Focus

46:27.467 --> 46:30.267
 <I>On Something Positive</I>
 <I>Like You Tell Me.</I>

46:30.267 --> 46:32.167
Yes. Yes.

46:32.167 --> 46:34.133
Yes, I Suppose
You're Right.

46:34.133 --> 46:36.133
Yes.

46:36.133 --> 46:38.534
That Roasted Chicken
Was Good.

46:38.534 --> 46:40.133
I'll Try To Focus
On That.

Is Happening?

Let's Look Under
The Hood! Out!

46:58.334 --> 47:01.767
No No No No No
No No No.

47:01.767 --> 47:03.534
Not My Car!

47:06.300 --> 47:09.734
No No.
Not My Electra.

47:09.734 --> 47:12.634
If I Lose That,
I Lose Everything.

47:12.634 --> 47:15.901
Let's Just Leave
It Here Tonight.

47:15.901 --> 47:17.334
We'll Come Back
In The Morning,

47:17.334 --> 47:18.767
Get It Towed
And Repaired.

47:18.767 --> 47:20.400
Really?
With What Money?

47:20.400 --> 47:22.734
We'll Figure
Something Out.

47:22.734 --> 47:25.234
Let's Just
Get A Taxi Home.

47:25.234 --> 47:26.801
No.

47:26.801 --> 47:29.968
No, You Go.
I Can't Now.

47:29.968 --> 47:32.801
I Need To Walk
This Whole Evening Off.

47:32.801 --> 47:34.501
Oh, Come On, Henry.

47:34.501 --> 47:36.934
You Shouldn't Do
Such A Long Walk Alone.

47:36.934 --> 47:39.367
What Do I Look Like?!
A Feeble Old Man?

47:39.367 --> 47:41.534
You've Been In Manhattan
For 10 Minutes,

47:41.534 --> 47:43.334
You're Going To Tell Me
What To Do?

47:43.334 --> 47:45.300
I Told You I Want
To Walk Home Alone.

47:45.300 --> 47:46.968
- I Was Just--
- I--

47:46.968 --> 47:50.067
Just Go!
I Don't Need You.

I'm Sorry, Were You
Reading Something?

48:22.100 --> 48:23.834
I Didn't Mean
To Interrupt You.

48:23.834 --> 48:27.033
No. No.
No, I Was Just--

48:29.467 --> 48:30.801
No, I Wasn't
Reading Anything.

48:30.801 --> 48:34.267
I Realize We Never Went Out
And Had That Lunch.

48:34.267 --> 48:36.100
Are You By Chance
Available Today?

48:40.434 --> 48:42.534
 <I>Did I Mention A Few</I>
 <I>Of Us From Work</I>

48:42.534 --> 48:45.467
Are Going To See "I Am Cuba"
At The Cinema Village Tonight?

48:45.467 --> 48:47.133
You Should Come.

48:47.133 --> 48:48.400
Really?

48:49.734 --> 48:52.167
That Would Be Wonderful.
Thank You.

48:54.801 --> 48:56.767
I Find You Funny, Louis.

48:56.767 --> 48:58.200
In What Way?

48:58.200 --> 49:01.968
I Mean,
You're Interesting.

49:01.968 --> 49:04.901
Sometimes You Remind Me
Of A Guy From Another
Time Period--

49:04.901 --> 49:07.767
Like The '20S.

49:07.767 --> 49:10.100
It's Funny
You Should Say That.

49:10.100 --> 49:12.267
I Love That Era--

49:12.267 --> 49:13.968
The Literature
From That Era.

49:13.968 --> 49:16.300
I Never Told Anyone This,

49:16.300 --> 49:19.067
But Sometimes,
In My Head,

49:19.067 --> 49:20.968
I Actually Imagine

49:20.968 --> 49:23.334
There's Somebody
Narrating My Life,

49:23.334 --> 49:27.100
( WHISPERING )
As If I'm The Protagonist
In A Classic Novel.

49:29.267 --> 49:30.434
Okay.

49:30.434 --> 49:31.901
Narrator:
 <I>The Young Gentleman</I>

49:31.901 --> 49:34.300
 <I>Immediately Regretted</I>
 <I>This Confession.</I>

49:34.300 --> 49:37.133
 <I>He Struggled To Quickly</I>
 <I>Change The Subject.</I>

49:37.133 --> 49:39.033
So I Never Asked You,

49:39.033 --> 49:40.901
How Did The Whole
Upstate Thing Go?

49:40.901 --> 49:42.968
Amazing.

49:42.968 --> 49:44.801
You Should Come
To The Next One.

49:44.801 --> 49:47.534
And Bring Someone Of Course.
Do You Live Alone?

49:47.534 --> 49:50.367
No, I Have A Roommate,
But He's Much Older.

49:50.367 --> 49:52.234
Old, Actually.

49:52.234 --> 49:54.200
I Just Rent A Room
In His Apartment.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.467
To Be Honest,
It's Not Going So Well.

49:56.467 --> 49:59.133
He Gets Irrationally
Mad At Me.

50:00.467 --> 50:02.701
Maybe He's
In Love With You.

50:02.701 --> 50:04.000
No.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.901
No.

50:05.901 --> 50:08.501
I Would Never Want
To Think Of Him Like That.

50:08.501 --> 50:11.501
There Was One Time
It Crossed My Mind But--

50:11.501 --> 50:14.567
Why? What Did He Do
That Made You Wonder?

50:14.567 --> 50:16.868
Well,

50:16.868 --> 50:18.701
It's Kind Of Strange,

50:18.701 --> 50:20.901
But We Were
Drinking Wine

50:20.901 --> 50:22.868
And I Was Lying
On The Floor

50:22.868 --> 50:25.868
Trying To Work Up
The Energy To Go To Bed,

50:25.868 --> 50:28.601
And Something
Very Odd Happened.

That's It?

50:48.901 --> 50:51.567

50:51.567 --> 50:53.868
I Guess It Was Nothing.

50:53.868 --> 50:56.334
I Don't Know Why
I Just Told You That.

50:56.334 --> 50:58.601
I'm Sorry.

50:58.601 --> 51:03.100
Louis, There's Something
I Wanted To Ask You.

51:03.100 --> 51:05.367
Sure.

51:05.367 --> 51:08.634
Well, You Know That Guy
I Started Seeing?

51:08.634 --> 51:10.567
He's Going To Jamaica
On Thursday,

51:10.567 --> 51:12.567
And He Invited Me
To Come With Him.

51:12.567 --> 51:14.467
I Really
Really Wanna Go.

51:14.467 --> 51:16.701
I've Never Been Out
Of The Country Before,

51:16.701 --> 51:18.467
And I'm So
Into Bob Marley.

51:18.467 --> 51:20.868
But George Is Giving Me
A Hard Time At Work

51:20.868 --> 51:22.567
With All The Photo
Clearances Piling Up,

51:22.567 --> 51:25.634
So I Convinced Him
That You Could Cover For Me

51:25.634 --> 51:26.767
While I Was Away.

51:26.767 --> 51:28.901
It's Just
For A Couple Days.

51:34.501 --> 51:37.934

51:56.300 --> 52:00.334
- How Are You?
- I'm All Right.

Seem Better.

Has Lifted,

52:04.400 --> 52:07.100
Although I Couldn't
Tell You Why.

52:07.100 --> 52:09.200
I Got A Call
From The Gas Station.

They Said Just To Get
My Car To Run

52:13.200 --> 52:14.701

52:14.701 --> 52:16.801
About A Very Promising
Room In Palm Beach.

52:18.567 --> 52:20.534
- Good For You.
- <I>Which Reminds Me--</I>

52:20.534 --> 52:23.334
I Have A Proposal

52:23.334 --> 52:25.367
Which Might
Save You Money.

To Let Me Borrow Your Car

52:29.534 --> 52:32.367
To Keep With Me
In Florida,

52:32.367 --> 52:33.534
Just For Two Months-

Your Auto Insurance

52:39.000 --> 52:41.801
So That's Your Motivation
For Speaking To Me Again?

52:41.801 --> 52:45.767
Well--
Partially, Yes.

52:45.767 --> 52:48.634
It's An Idea I Thought
Would Benefit Us Both.

52:48.634 --> 52:51.367
Why Don't You Follow
Through On Your Offer

52:51.367 --> 52:53.767

To Vivian Cudlip's Niece?

That Would Be Of
A Lot More Use To Me

Right Now
Than Insurance Money.

52:59.534 --> 53:02.367
No, I Can't.
It Wouldn't Be Right.

53:03.968 --> 53:05.100

So Wrong With Me?

55:39.000 --> 55:41.033
- Just Throw It Out.
- Hey Hey, Littering?

55:41.033 --> 55:42.701
- ( SCREAMING )
- <I>( TIRES SQUEALING )</I>

55:42.701 --> 55:45.467
- A Lion!
- Oh My God!

55:45.467 --> 55:46.834
( LAUGHING )

55:49.033 --> 55:52.367
- Mary: <I>Oh My God.</I>
- I'm Sorry.

55:52.367 --> 55:54.767
I Seriously Just Had
A Heart Attack.

55:54.767 --> 55:58.200
I'm Just Having

55:58.200 --> 56:02.267
The Worst Day Ever, Mary.

56:02.267 --> 56:03.968
Let's Go See
What That Was.

56:05.601 --> 56:07.100
- Shit.
- Go Go Go.

56:07.100 --> 56:10.300
Oh, God.
Did I Kill It?

56:13.834 --> 56:16.400
Somebody's Idea
Of A Joke.

56:16.400 --> 56:18.267
 <I>He Is Kind</I>
 <I>Of Cute, Though.</I>

56:18.267 --> 56:21.100
- ( LAUGHS ) He Is.
- You Know What, Louis?

56:21.100 --> 56:23.334
I Think I'm Just...

56:23.334 --> 56:25.667
Going To Walk The Rest
Of The Way From Here.

56:25.667 --> 56:27.901
- Oh, Sure.
- <I>Bye, You Two!</I>

56:31.501 --> 56:34.601
Okay Okay Okay.

56:36.467 --> 56:39.334
( GROANING )
Oh God.

56:40.968 --> 56:42.634
Henry:
 <I>We'll Speak</I>
 <I>In The Morning, Gershon.</I>

56:42.634 --> 56:45.601
Get Some Rest.
You're Looking More
Haggard Than Usual.

56:47.667 --> 56:49.367
Oh God!

56:49.367 --> 56:53.501
You Should Really Stop
Lurking About In The Shadows,

56:53.501 --> 56:55.601
 <I>It's Becoming A Serious</I>
 <I>Character Flaw.</I>

56:55.601 --> 56:58.734
I Just Got In.
Excuse Me.

56:58.734 --> 57:02.000
What A Disastrous Evening.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.467
My God, Gershon Served

57:04.467 --> 57:06.901
Boiled Tongue For Dinner.

57:06.901 --> 57:10.133
 <I>And Then Later We Taxied Over</I>
 <I>To Take A Look At My Car,</I>

57:10.133 --> 57:13.767
And Gershon Confirmed That
It's Completely Beyond Repair.

57:13.767 --> 57:17.000
However, I Did Remember
That The Last Time

57:17.000 --> 57:18.901
I Was Out At Vivian's Place
In Southampton

57:18.901 --> 57:22.133
I Happened To Notice
A Beautiful Vehicle For Sale

57:22.133 --> 57:24.701
 <I>Out By The Bay,</I>
 <I>Where The Riff Raff Stay.</I>

57:24.701 --> 57:28.501
Gershon And I Were Thinking
Of Going Up This Weekend--

57:28.501 --> 57:30.534
Have A Look,
See If It's Still There.

57:30.534 --> 57:32.501
Want To Come Along?

57:32.501 --> 57:36.334
I Take It You're
Just Looking For A Ride?

57:36.334 --> 57:37.801
Yes,

57:37.801 --> 57:40.934
But Why Focus On It
That Way?

57:40.934 --> 57:42.534
Think Of Yourself!

57:42.534 --> 57:45.968
It's Supposed
To Be An Unseasonably
Beautiful Weekend,

57:45.968 --> 57:47.734
Courtesy
Of Global Warming.

57:47.734 --> 57:50.334
And I Think You'd Enjoy
Meeting Gershon.

57:50.334 --> 57:53.701
He's-- Well, Different.

57:56.033 --> 57:57.767
( HONKING )

58:03.434 --> 58:05.033
Where's Gershon?

58:05.033 --> 58:07.400
Gershon Is
Pathologically Late.

58:07.400 --> 58:10.234
Why Don't You Go In
And Urge Him On?

58:11.501 --> 58:12.934
I Don't Even Know Him.

58:12.934 --> 58:14.901
You Really Should See
His Apartment.

58:14.901 --> 58:16.300
It's Quite Interesting.

58:18.267 --> 58:19.501
Okay.

58:19.501 --> 58:22.167
I'll Just Take It
For A Little Spin.

58:22.167 --> 58:23.300
Joking.

58:24.367 --> 58:26.334
 <I>Oh, Look.</I>

58:26.334 --> 58:28.701
( SPEAKING French )
 <I>Decapotable.</I>

58:28.701 --> 58:31.000
( LAUGHS )

58:39.901 --> 58:41.400
Gershon?

58:47.200 --> 58:48.234
Gershon?

58:50.100 --> 58:52.801
( KNOCKS )
Gershon?

58:53.868 --> 58:56.133
 <I>Hello?</I>

59:03.734 --> 59:06.334
Oh! Hello, I'm Louis--

59:06.334 --> 59:08.868
Henry's Roommate.

59:08.868 --> 59:11.300
We Were Waiting
In The Car

59:11.300 --> 59:12.801
And Henry Wanted Me To--

59:12.801 --> 59:14.667
( HIGH VOICE )
Please Accept My Apologies.

59:16.400 --> 59:18.601
I Was Just Putting
My Shoes On.

59:18.601 --> 59:20.634
No, Of Course.

59:28.367 --> 59:30.701
Wow, Look At This.

59:30.701 --> 59:33.234
You Have So Many
Interesting Things.

59:33.234 --> 59:35.701
( HIGH VOICE CONTINUING )
Yes, I Collect Souvenirs.

59:35.701 --> 59:38.234
Must Have Been Everywhere.

59:38.234 --> 59:39.501
No.

59:39.501 --> 59:40.934
I Actually Have
Never Been Anywhere.

59:40.934 --> 59:43.100
Too Busy Working.

59:43.100 --> 59:46.634
What Kind Of Work
Do You Do, Gershon?

59:46.634 --> 59:48.767
I'm A Subway Mechanic.

59:53.200 --> 59:54.834
- Sorry.
- Anyway...

59:54.834 --> 59:57.667
I Do Love My Job.,

59:58.901 --> 01:00:00.567
But It's Always
Been My Dream

01:00:00.567 --> 01:00:01.634
To Buy A Sailboat

01:00:01.634 --> 01:00:03.767
And Sail Off
With A Beautiful Woman

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.200
To The Mediterranean.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.067
We'd Travel Straight
To The Blue Grotto,

01:00:07.067 --> 01:00:09.367
Where Tiny Rowboats Wait.

01:00:09.367 --> 01:00:13.367
Then We'd Paddle Out
Into The Warm Wet Cave,

01:00:13.367 --> 01:00:15.934
And Kiss And Sing

01:00:15.934 --> 01:00:19.167
And Harmonize
With Our Own Echoes.

01:00:21.234 --> 01:00:22.934
I Still Believe
It's Possible.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.667
The Boat And The Woman.

01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:30.701
 <I>( Henry SINGING</I>
 <I>IN French )</I>

01:00:36.367 --> 01:00:38.367
What's That Song?
That's A Good One.

01:00:38.367 --> 01:00:41.033
From An Operetta I Saw
When I Was Living In Paris--

01:00:41.033 --> 01:00:43.734
 <I>"Pas Sur La Bouche."</I>
"Not On The Mouth."

01:00:43.734 --> 01:00:45.901
It's About A Man
Who Doesn't Like

01:00:45.901 --> 01:00:47.300
To Be Kissed
On The Mouth.

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.667
That's The Whole Plot.

01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:51.267
- No, That's Insane!
- <I>Why? I Happen To Agree.</I>

01:00:51.267 --> 01:00:53.501
Rubbing Noses Is
Far More Sanitary.

01:00:53.501 --> 01:00:56.000
How Did You Afford
To Live Abroad, Henry?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.067
I Had An Inheritance.

01:00:58.067 --> 01:01:00.734
 <I>Both My Parents Were Dead</I>
 <I>By The Time I Was 22.</I>

01:01:00.734 --> 01:01:02.968
So I Moved To Europe
For 10 Years,

01:01:02.968 --> 01:01:05.467
Spent Every Last Cent.

01:01:05.467 --> 01:01:07.834
Did Both Your Parents
Die At The Same Time?

01:01:07.834 --> 01:01:10.501
My Father Died 
When I Was Two.

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:13.234
Actually I Was Raised
By My Bohemian Aunt. 

01:01:13.234 --> 01:01:14.534
Why Not Your Mother?

01:01:14.534 --> 01:01:19.200
My Mother Was Afraid Of Me.
My Aunt Understood Me.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.434
She Taught Literature
At Johns Hopkins.

01:01:21.434 --> 01:01:24.901
She Was Always
Taking Ships To Europe

01:01:24.901 --> 01:01:27.601
And Having Love Affairs.

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:31.434
Quite Beautiful,
But She Never Married.

01:01:31.434 --> 01:01:33.434
 <I>Fascinating Woman.</I>

01:01:33.434 --> 01:01:35.033
Sounds Like You
Really Loved Her.

01:01:37.968 --> 01:01:40.100
This Is Starting To Sound
Like An Interview.

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.200
Are You Planning To Write
The Unauthorized Biography

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.467
Of An Obscure Playwright
Whose Masterpiece Was Stolen
By A Hunchback?

01:01:45.467 --> 01:01:48.300
Is It So Wrong
To Be Interested In You?

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.033
Yes!
I'm Not Interested In You.

01:01:50.033 --> 01:01:52.133
From Now On
I Intend To Give You

01:01:52.133 --> 01:01:53.968
The Most Misleading
Image Possible.

01:01:53.968 --> 01:01:56.200
You May Write
My Biography,

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.267
But You Will Never
Capture My Soul.

01:02:06.801 --> 01:02:08.734
Henry:
Thank God
We've Finally Landed.

01:02:08.734 --> 01:02:11.133
Between Manhattan
And The East End,

01:02:11.133 --> 01:02:13.834
There's Nothing
But Cemeteries And Strip Clubs.

01:02:13.834 --> 01:02:17.634
Did You Know
That Topless Bars

01:02:17.634 --> 01:02:19.667
Do Their Best Business
On Mother's Day?

01:02:19.667 --> 01:02:21.434
 <I>It's The Udders.</I>

01:02:21.434 --> 01:02:24.167
That's The Day Men
Most Need To See Them.

01:02:24.167 --> 01:02:26.133
That Actually Makes
Lots Of Sense.

01:02:26.133 --> 01:02:29.400
This Certainly
Is A Beautiful Inlet.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.133
 <I>Maybe It's A Cove.</I>

01:02:31.133 --> 01:02:33.934
I Believe The Appropriate Word
Is Actually "Bight."

01:02:33.934 --> 01:02:36.467
 <I>B-I-G-H-T,</I>

01:02:36.467 --> 01:02:40.868
A Noun Meaning
"A Wide Bay Formed
By Curved Land."

01:02:40.868 --> 01:02:44.334
 <I>There's All Kinds</I>
 <I>Of Wonderful Words</I>
 <I>In The Bs Actually.</I>

01:02:44.334 --> 01:02:47.200
My Personal Favorite
Is "Bisextile,"

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.033
 <I>Which Means Nothing</I>
 <I>Like It Sounds.</I>

01:02:49.033 --> 01:02:50.534
Believe It Or Not
It Means,

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:52.968
"Of Or Pertaining
To Leap Year."

01:02:52.968 --> 01:02:55.834
So Next February 29th,

01:02:55.834 --> 01:02:57.033
We Should All Remember

01:02:57.033 --> 01:02:59.767
To Wish Each Other
A Happy Bisextile Day!

01:02:59.767 --> 01:03:01.167
( LAUGHING )

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.400
Thank God
It's Still Here.

01:03:10.667 --> 01:03:12.968
Look At Her.
Oh, Yes.

01:03:12.968 --> 01:03:17.434
- A Thing Of Beauty.
- The 1975 Cadillac
V-8 El Dorado.

01:03:17.434 --> 01:03:20.434
- Henry: <I>Excellent.</I>
- 400 Horsepower,

01:03:20.434 --> 01:03:24.000
- 500 Pound-Feet Of Torque...
- Mm-Hmm.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.801
...And Single Digit
Gas Mileage.

01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:27.901
That's Terrible
For The Environment.

01:03:27.901 --> 01:03:29.634
Oh, And I Suppose
Yours Is Better?

01:03:29.634 --> 01:03:32.667
It Seems The Owners Have
Left For The Season.

01:03:32.667 --> 01:03:35.434
 <I>We Should Call And Arrange</I>
 <I>A Test Drive, Henry.</I>

01:03:35.434 --> 01:03:36.567
We've Come All This Way,

01:03:36.567 --> 01:03:38.801
We Might As Well Have
A Peek Under The Hood.

01:03:38.801 --> 01:03:40.734
Climb In There
And Try And Open Her Up.

01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:44.067
It's Open.

01:03:44.067 --> 01:03:46.067
New Tires.
That's Good.

01:03:46.067 --> 01:03:48.767
Okay.
Henry, I Can't--

01:03:48.767 --> 01:03:51.567
 <I>Let Gershon Do It.</I>
 <I>He's The Mechanically</I>
 <I>Inclined One.</I>

01:03:51.567 --> 01:03:53.300
I Don't See One.

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:55.701
Maybe This Is
A Secret Hood Release.

01:03:55.701 --> 01:03:57.300
- Oh, No!
- No!

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:00.167
Scheisse.

01:04:01.968 --> 01:04:04.200
 <I>Better Vamoose Before</I>
 <I>The</I> Polizei <I>Arrive.</I>

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:08.934
- Louis: <I>Henry.</I>
- Woman: <I>Who's That?</I>

01:04:08.934 --> 01:04:11.968
Henry:
At Least I Have
A Piece Of A New Car.

01:04:11.968 --> 01:04:13.267
Tomorrow I'll Call
And Inquire

01:04:13.267 --> 01:04:15.434
As To The Price
Of The Rest Of It.

01:04:15.434 --> 01:04:16.601
Louis:
Henry, You Can't.

01:04:16.601 --> 01:04:18.801
That's Like Returning
To The Scene Of A Crime.

01:04:18.801 --> 01:04:20.868
Are You Insane?
They'd Never Suspect Me.

01:04:20.868 --> 01:04:22.234
Who'd Be Stupid Enough

01:04:22.234 --> 01:04:25.167
To Deface A Car And Then
Inquire About Its Price?

01:04:25.167 --> 01:04:26.634
You Know, Gershon,

01:04:26.634 --> 01:04:28.601
This Young Man
Is Very Well Read,

01:04:28.601 --> 01:04:30.868
But He Knows Nothing
About Real Life.

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:33.267
Yes, I'm Starting
To Think That.

01:04:33.267 --> 01:04:36.701
Yes, He's Such A Sad,
Old Soul Too.

01:04:36.701 --> 01:04:40.200
You Know That He's Never
Even Learned How To Dance?

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.934
That's More Than Sad.
That's Tragic.

01:04:42.934 --> 01:04:46.400
Well, If Henry Would Let Me
Watch Him Once In A While,

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.434
I Might Pick Up
A Step Or Two.

01:04:48.434 --> 01:04:50.000
My Steps Cannot
Be Learned.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.834
They're Entirely Intuitive,
Based On Jungle Rhythms.

01:04:53.834 --> 01:04:54.801
Try Me.

01:04:56.334 --> 01:04:58.667
( CHUCKLES )
Very Well.

01:05:00.467 --> 01:05:02.834
Gershon, You've Got
A Beautiful Singing Voice.

01:05:02.834 --> 01:05:06.067
We Hear You In The Shower
All The Time, Going On And On.

01:05:06.067 --> 01:05:08.467
Why Don't You Sing Us
Something That's Danceable?

01:05:08.467 --> 01:05:10.300
What Genre Do You Prefer?

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.100
Um...
I Don't Know.

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:13.667
Let's Start
With A Waltz.

01:05:14.734 --> 01:05:16.834
- ( CLEARS THROAT )
- Yeah.

01:05:16.834 --> 01:05:18.801
Over Here.
We Need Space.

01:05:18.801 --> 01:05:24.133
- Now Observe And Imitate.
- ( DEEP VOICE )
* Somewhere My Love... 

01:05:24.133 --> 01:05:27.167
- Oh, Yes.
- * There Will Be
Songs To Sing... *

01:05:27.167 --> 01:05:29.701
So Once He's Singing,
He Has A Human Voice.

01:05:29.701 --> 01:05:32.501
Now Shoulders So.
Chest Out.

01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:36.200
Aristocratic.
Watch Closely.
Do As I Do.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.100
- One, Two, Three,
 One, Two, Three.
- <I>* Somewhere A Hill... </I>

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:44.267
- That's Right. Yes. Float!
- <I>* Blossoms In Green</I>
 <I> And Gold *</I>

01:05:44.267 --> 01:05:48.601
- * And There Are Dreams... 
- <I>Don't Bend Your Knees</I>
 <I> Too Much.</I>

01:05:48.601 --> 01:05:51.467
It's Not A Peasant Dance.
You're An Aristocrat!

01:05:51.467 --> 01:05:52.734
You're Above The World.

01:05:52.734 --> 01:05:56.133
- * Someday... 
- You're Floating.

01:05:56.133 --> 01:05:59.000
- <I>* We'll Meet Again... *</I>
- One And Turn, And Turn.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.767
- <I>* My Love... </I>
- Whirl-- The Dervishes!

01:06:01.767 --> 01:06:07.801
- It's Transcendent.
- * Someday, Whenever
The Spring Breaks Through. *

01:06:07.801 --> 01:06:10.501
That's It. Yes!
Ohh! Oh, Oh!

01:06:10.501 --> 01:06:12.801
- Henry! Henry, Are You Okay?
- ( Henry GROANING, SHOUTING )

01:06:12.801 --> 01:06:14.534
- Are You Okay?
- My Sciatica!

01:06:14.534 --> 01:06:16.467
What Do We Do?!

01:06:16.467 --> 01:06:19.234
What Do You Do?
Get Me Off This
Godforsaken Beach.

01:06:19.234 --> 01:06:21.634
I Need Alcohol
And Civilization.

01:06:21.634 --> 01:06:23.367
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, God.

01:06:23.367 --> 01:06:25.467
( GROANING )

01:06:25.467 --> 01:06:28.200
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- How Do We Do This?

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.801
( GROANING )
Don't Forget My Hat!

01:06:31.801 --> 01:06:33.901
Vivian Cudlip Bought
That For Me In Moscow!

01:06:33.901 --> 01:06:35.701
( HIGH VOICE )
Put Him On The Floor.

01:06:35.701 --> 01:06:38.434
I Know How To Fix Him.
I Did It Two Years Ago.

01:06:38.434 --> 01:06:39.934
No, You Didn't.
You Made It Worse.

01:06:39.934 --> 01:06:41.901
 <I>Don't Be Difficult,</I>
 <I>Henry.</I>

01:06:41.901 --> 01:06:45.100
I'm The One Who Got You
Walking Again And You Know It.

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:46.234
It's A Conspiracy,
Isn't It?

01:06:46.234 --> 01:06:47.634
Otto Bellman Hired You,
Didn't He?

01:06:47.634 --> 01:06:49.567
- To Assassinate Me.
- <I>Kneel Down.</I>

01:06:49.567 --> 01:06:52.133
Tell Him He Can Keep
My Damn Play!

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:54.200
- <I>On Your Stomach.</I>
 <I> All Right.</I>
- ( GROANING )

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.033
Shh. Now...

01:06:56.033 --> 01:06:58.667
I'm Going To Begin
By Applying Sharp Pressure...

01:06:58.667 --> 01:06:59.734
( SPITS )

01:06:59.734 --> 01:07:03.000
To The Areas Just Above
Both Buttocks.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.767
What?
Not With Your Hands
You're Not!

01:07:04.767 --> 01:07:08.234
I Don't Want Your Germs.
Use Some Other Technique.

01:07:08.234 --> 01:07:09.934
Fine.

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:14.133
Here, I'll Use This.

01:07:14.133 --> 01:07:16.267
Oh, I Don't Know About That,
Gershon. It Doesn't Look--

01:07:16.267 --> 01:07:18.501
- I'll Make It Work.
- What? What Are You--

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.734
- Hold Still.
- ( SCREAMING )

01:07:22.801 --> 01:07:24.634
Are You Insane?!
God!

01:07:24.634 --> 01:07:26.767
You're Trying To Kill Me!

01:07:26.767 --> 01:07:29.400
How In God's Name Is
That Supposed To Help?!

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.234
- Hey, Here's Some Brandy.
- I Know.

01:07:32.234 --> 01:07:34.100
I Need To Go Get
My Acupressure Book.

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.634
And I Have A Very Large
Vibrator Downstairs.

01:07:36.634 --> 01:07:38.400
- Mmm.
- I'll Be Right Back.

01:07:40.467 --> 01:07:41.934
Oh, God.

01:07:41.934 --> 01:07:44.901
Louis, I Think I See My--
My Eye Mask.

01:07:44.901 --> 01:07:47.667
It's My Eye Mask,
Isn't It?

01:07:47.667 --> 01:07:49.334
Oh My... God.

01:07:49.334 --> 01:07:50.868
Ohh!

01:07:50.868 --> 01:07:53.601
Mmm! Oh.

01:07:54.901 --> 01:07:57.167
Let Me Get You A Pillow.

01:07:57.167 --> 01:07:58.300
Louis. Louis.

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.000
For God's Sake,
Do Not--

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Do Not Let...
Gershon In With His Vibrator.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.701
You Can Imagine Where
That Thing's Been.

01:08:05.701 --> 01:08:07.734
All I Need Is Sleep.

01:08:07.734 --> 01:08:10.267
I Need To Put On
My Eye Mask.

01:08:10.267 --> 01:08:12.367
Don't Worry.
I'll Handle Gershon.

01:08:15.834 --> 01:08:18.834
If, By Chance,
I Die In My Sleep,

01:08:18.834 --> 01:08:20.501
I Want You To Make Sure

01:08:20.501 --> 01:08:23.300
That The Funeral Mass
Is In <I>Latin.</I>

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:26.600
And Give All My Worldly Goods
To Catholic Charities,

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.334
Except For The Christmas Balls.
Those Go To You.

01:08:29.334 --> 01:08:32.200
You're Not Going To Die.
Just Get Some Sleep, Okay?

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.133
Yes, Sleep.

01:08:35.133 --> 01:08:37.133
You Know, Louis,

01:08:37.133 --> 01:08:39.367
In Spite
Of Your Quirks,

01:08:39.367 --> 01:08:41.901
 <I>I Think You're</I>
 <I>The Sanest Person I Know.</I>

01:08:41.901 --> 01:08:44.901
I'm Very Lucky
To Have You Here.

01:08:46.701 --> 01:08:48.667
- <I>( DOOR BANGS )</I>
- Gershon: <I>I've Got</I>
 <I> The Vibrator!</I>

01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:49.600
( SCREAMS )

01:08:53.466 --> 01:08:56.300
 <I>( PHONE RINGING )</I>

01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.300
( GROANS )

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.600
I Got It.

01:09:02.133 --> 01:09:03.466
I Got It.

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.100
H. Harrison's Residence.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.667
Oh. Yes.

01:09:12.667 --> 01:09:14.667
Just One Minute,
Please.

01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:17.801
It's Vivian Cudlip's
Secretary.

01:09:22.868 --> 01:09:25.000
H. Harrison.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.300
 <I>I'm Sorry?</I>

01:09:27.701 --> 01:09:30.901
Oh. Oh, Vivian,
How Are You, Dear?

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.133
Yes. Oh,
That Sounds Lovely.

01:09:36.133 --> 01:09:38.901
Yes, I Look Forward To It.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:43.033
Oh, God, God, God, God.

01:09:43.033 --> 01:09:44.567
Is Something Wrong?

01:09:44.567 --> 01:09:47.399
Vivian's Hosting
A Dinner Party Tonight
At The Russian Tea Room.

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:48.968
She Wants Me
To Escort Her.

01:09:48.968 --> 01:09:51.868
And Look At Me, Lying Here
Like A Useless Old Man.

01:09:51.868 --> 01:09:54.367
Maybe You Should
Just Call Her Back

01:09:54.367 --> 01:09:56.100
 <I>And Tell Her</I>
 <I>The Truth.</I>

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.334
I'm Sure
She'd Understand.

01:09:57.334 --> 01:09:59.934
At Her Age She Must
Have Health Problems.

01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:03.100
Vivian Has Had Every Cancer
There Is-- Twice.

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:05.667
Not To Mention A Hole
In Her Heart.

01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:07.868
But That Hasn't Stopped Her
Ever From Going Out.

01:10:09.367 --> 01:10:12.267
If I Let Vivian Contact
Any Of The Other Rosen Knights,

01:10:12.267 --> 01:10:13.767
 <I>I'll Be Banished.</I>

01:10:13.767 --> 01:10:16.067
But, Henry,
There's No Way You Can Go.

01:10:16.067 --> 01:10:18.100
No.

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:20.000
No.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.534
But You Can.

01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:24.567
Me?

01:10:43.534 --> 01:10:45.167
 <I>( DOORBELL RINGS )</I>

01:10:47.501 --> 01:10:50.267
Hello. I'm Here
For Mrs. Cudlip.

01:10:50.267 --> 01:10:51.901
Woman:
 <I>Come In.</I>

01:10:57.033 --> 01:10:58.334
Wait Here.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.300
( WHISPERING )

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.801
Come In.

01:11:10.234 --> 01:11:11.667
 <I>You're Louis.</I>

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:13.734
Henry's Young Friend.

01:11:13.734 --> 01:11:15.000
 <I>Yes.</I>

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.801
It's A Pleasure
To Meet You, Mrs. Cudlip.

01:11:18.801 --> 01:11:21.067
I've Heard Nothing
But Wonderful Things.

01:11:21.067 --> 01:11:23.734
Well, If Henry Said Them,
Don't Believe A Word.

01:11:23.734 --> 01:11:27.234
Lately That Man Is
Not To Be Trusted.

01:11:28.801 --> 01:11:31.767
He Introduced
My Granddaughter

01:11:31.767 --> 01:11:34.901
To A Deformed
Swiss Con Man,

01:11:34.901 --> 01:11:36.601
And I'm Not Happy
About It.

01:11:36.601 --> 01:11:40.434
- That's Shocking.
- He Can Be A Dear
Friend, Henry,

01:11:40.434 --> 01:11:44.534
But He's Annoyingly Intent
At Being Something More.

01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:48.701
He's Always Dropping Hints
About Marrying Me, You Know.

01:11:48.701 --> 01:11:50.334
No, I Didn't.

01:11:50.334 --> 01:11:53.634
And My Other Friend, Aresh,
Is The Same Way.

01:11:53.634 --> 01:11:56.801
( CHUCKLING )
You'll Meet Him At Dinner.

01:11:56.801 --> 01:12:00.267
- This Rose Is For You.
- Very Thoughtful.

01:12:01.767 --> 01:12:03.868
The Car's Waiting.

01:12:03.868 --> 01:12:06.200
- May I Help You?
- Let's Go.

01:12:07.434 --> 01:12:09.100
Get This For You.

01:12:12.534 --> 01:12:16.334
So What Do You Think
Of The Russian Tea Room, Louis?

01:12:16.334 --> 01:12:20.000
This Caviar Is Wonderful.
The Champagne As Well.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.467
Yes. I Want More.

01:12:21.467 --> 01:12:25.133
Right Away, Mrs. Cudlip.
Anything You Need, Just Ask.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.767
( SPEAKING Arabic )

01:12:29.767 --> 01:12:31.834
A Toast To Vivian.

01:12:31.834 --> 01:12:35.501
- Oh, Yes.
- The Most Beautiful,

01:12:35.501 --> 01:12:37.801
The Most Sophisticated,
The Most Cultured...

01:12:37.801 --> 01:12:40.467
- Waiter, I Need A Straw.
- <I>...The Most Prominent...</I>

01:12:40.467 --> 01:12:43.367
- Of Course.
- ...And The Most Popular

01:12:43.367 --> 01:12:47.000
Grand Dame
In All Of New York!

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.167
( SUCKING )

01:12:49.801 --> 01:12:52.367
Also, You Have Received
A Phone Message, Mrs. Cudlip.

01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:53.334
Oh, Thank You.

01:12:55.334 --> 01:12:57.701
It's Nice To See
You Again, Meredith.

01:12:57.701 --> 01:13:01.167
Oh.

01:13:01.167 --> 01:13:02.534
Oh, That's Right. Yes.

01:13:02.534 --> 01:13:03.801
Yes, Hello.

01:13:03.801 --> 01:13:06.167
I'm Sorry We Couldn't
Accompany You And Lois

01:13:06.167 --> 01:13:07.834
To The Whitney
That Night.

01:13:07.834 --> 01:13:09.801
Henry Was A Bit
Out Of Sorts.

01:13:09.801 --> 01:13:11.300
You Mean Rude.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.133
But You Know,
I Don't Care.

01:13:13.133 --> 01:13:15.100
Henry Is Horrible
To All Women.

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.367
Oh, I Don't Think
That's True.

01:13:17.367 --> 01:13:19.667
He Had His Heart
Broken Years Ago

01:13:19.667 --> 01:13:21.501
When He Was Young
And Handsome

01:13:21.501 --> 01:13:22.901
And Still Had Money,

01:13:22.901 --> 01:13:25.934
And He Takes It Out
On Women Ever Since.

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:29.000
 <I>You Know, He Was In Love</I>
 <I>With A Catholic Girl.</I>

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.067
Her Family Wouldn't
Accept Him.

01:13:31.067 --> 01:13:33.334
 <I>Henry's Protestant,</I>

01:13:33.334 --> 01:13:36.734
And He Pretends
Ever Since To Be Catholic

01:13:36.734 --> 01:13:40.267
Because He Thinks It Has Some
Sort Of Moral Snob Appeal.

01:13:40.267 --> 01:13:43.300
Spencer Mooney
Told Me He Suspects

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:46.234
That Henry
Is Homosexual.

01:13:46.234 --> 01:13:47.701
People Say That Too.

01:13:47.701 --> 01:13:49.601
 <I>And He Was</I>
 <I>In The Theater.</I>

01:13:49.601 --> 01:13:51.801
Theater Types Need To Be
A Little Homosexual

01:13:51.801 --> 01:13:53.801
So They Can Feel Things
More Deeply.

01:13:53.801 --> 01:13:56.334
But Henry Is The Opposite--
He Has No Feelings.

01:13:56.334 --> 01:13:58.767
- I Don't Think So.
- Oh, I Think So.

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:00.634
I Give Up.

01:14:00.634 --> 01:14:02.000
Louis,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.968
Could You Read This Name
Here For Me, Please?

01:14:04.968 --> 01:14:06.968
Of Course.

01:14:06.968 --> 01:14:09.000
"Barry Barbarash."

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.767
Oh, I'm Not Going
To Answer That.

01:14:10.767 --> 01:14:12.634
If He Hears
I'm With Other Men,

01:14:12.634 --> 01:14:15.434
He Just Gets
Wildly Jealous.

01:14:15.434 --> 01:14:18.267
Yes, Vivian, I Wouldn't
Encourage Him.

01:14:18.267 --> 01:14:20.334
He Is Charming

01:14:20.334 --> 01:14:22.667
And Has Very Wonderful
Long Legs,

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:25.634
But He Spies On You,
Vivian, In Palm Beach.

01:14:25.634 --> 01:14:28.200
Yes.
He Has Binoculars

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.267
And He Looks At You

01:14:30.267 --> 01:14:32.868
When You Undress
In Your Room At The Colony.

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:34.300
Don't Get Started, Aresh.

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.767

Did I Really Hurt
His Feelings?

01:15:21.968 --> 01:15:24.868
Oh Yes, I Think So.
Aresh Offends Easily.

01:15:24.868 --> 01:15:27.701
I'm Terribly Sorry.

But She Doesn't Even
Consider It.

I Sent You There
To Keep My Rivals At Bay,
Not To Become One Of Them.

Actually,
I Feel Sorry For Vivian.

01:19:01.834 --> 01:19:04.501
Everybody Seems To Want
Something From Her,

And Yet She's
Still So Sweet.

Sweet? Vivian?
She's A Monster.

She Treats Her Staff.

It's Like Something
Out Of "Peter The Great."

Oh.

01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:17.567

A Sweet Monster.

First Time Here?

01:27:25.868 --> 01:27:27.934
Yes, Actually It Is.

01:27:30.033 --> 01:27:32.601
I'm Miss Pepper,
And If You're Interested

01:27:32.601 --> 01:27:35.200
In Dating A Woman
Like Me, You Can.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:38.534
Many Of The Beautiful Girls
Here Are Available
For A Date.

01:27:38.534 --> 01:27:41.033
For A Donation, That Is.

01:27:41.033 --> 01:27:43.100
I Don't Think So,

01:27:45.133 --> 01:27:47.634
But They Are
Beautiful.

01:27:49.167 --> 01:27:51.734
I Don't Understand
How You Do It.

01:27:52.868 --> 01:27:54.934
Oh.

01:27:57.834 --> 01:27:59.267
You Know,

01:27:59.267 --> 01:28:01.133
You'd Actually Make
A Pretty Girl Yourself.

01:28:01.133 --> 01:28:05.167
Put On A Fierce Blond Wig
To Go With Your Bright Eyes.

01:28:05.167 --> 01:28:07.200
 <I>Contour Your Nose A Bit.</I>

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:10.167
My Nose Is Very Masculine,
Isn't It?

01:28:10.167 --> 01:28:12.167
Honey, If There's
A Woman In There,

01:28:12.167 --> 01:28:14.801
It Would Take More
Than A Nose To Keep Her Down.

01:28:31.501 --> 01:28:32.868
George?

01:28:32.868 --> 01:28:34.701
Yes.

01:28:34.701 --> 01:28:36.667
You Must Be Sandra.
Please Come In.

01:28:36.667 --> 01:28:38.467
Where Do You
Want To Do This?

01:28:38.467 --> 01:28:40.501
I Usually Suggest
The Kitchen.

01:28:40.501 --> 01:28:42.267
Okay. Sure.

01:28:42.267 --> 01:28:43.801
Great. Strip Down
To Your Underwear

01:28:43.801 --> 01:28:45.334
And We'll Get Started.

01:28:49.767 --> 01:28:51.868
This Is What
I'd Like To Wear.

01:28:53.801 --> 01:28:55.901
Sure, If It Fits.

01:28:57.534 --> 01:28:59.434
You Given Any Thought
To The Wig?

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:00.934
I Brought Three.

01:29:00.934 --> 01:29:03.434
Yes. I'd Like
Brunette, Please.

01:29:03.434 --> 01:29:05.901
In Fact,

01:29:05.901 --> 01:29:08.033
I Would Like To Look...

01:29:09.167 --> 01:29:11.367
As Much As Possible
Like Her.

01:29:18.667 --> 01:29:22.367
* A Plume Of Doom
Will Rise *

01:29:23.968 --> 01:29:29.400
* Eluding Hearts
And Skies *

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:34.133
* Destroying Eagles' Eyes *

01:29:34.133 --> 01:29:37.234
* While We All Lament 

01:29:37.234 --> 01:29:42.801
* This Business
Of Cement. *

01:29:42.801 --> 01:29:43.767
 <I>What Was That?</I>

01:29:46.033 --> 01:29:48.200
I Thought Maybe I Would
Contribute A Song

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.367
To The Next Rally.

01:29:49.367 --> 01:29:51.300
 <I>I Think It Kind </I>
 <I>Of Works, Maybe.</I>

01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:53.601
- ( HISSES )
- What?

01:29:53.601 --> 01:29:54.868
It's A Little
Corny, No?

01:29:54.868 --> 01:29:56.701
Oh.

01:29:56.701 --> 01:29:58.467
- It's Not Finished Yet.
- ( CHUCKLES )

01:29:59.934 --> 01:30:01.667
That's Not Very Nice.

01:30:01.667 --> 01:30:03.334
 <I>Okay. I'm Sorry.</I>
 <I>I Just--</I>

01:30:03.334 --> 01:30:05.701
I Just Believe
That Honesty

01:30:05.701 --> 01:30:07.567
Is Super Important.

01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:10.701
You Know What?
Come On.

01:30:10.701 --> 01:30:12.434
 <I>Let's Go To Bed.</I>

01:30:12.434 --> 01:30:14.467
I'm Dying To See
That Surprise You Got.

01:30:28.334 --> 01:30:29.968
Ready?

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:41.501
Well?

01:30:43.334 --> 01:30:46.334
Narrator:
 <I>The Young Gentleman's</I>
 <I>Heart Sank.</I>

01:30:46.334 --> 01:30:49.434
 <I>He Looked Nothing Like</I>
 <I>What He Had Imagined. </I>

01:30:49.434 --> 01:30:51.000
 <I>In Fact,</I>

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.801
 <I>He Was Horrified</I>
 <I>By What He Saw.</I>

01:30:53.801 --> 01:30:56.801
Wait Wait.
I Forgot The Jewelry.

01:30:56.801 --> 01:30:58.968
 <I>But With This Crushing</I>
 <I>Disappointment</I>

01:30:58.968 --> 01:31:01.267
 <I>Came A Great</I>
 <I>Revelation--</I>

01:31:01.267 --> 01:31:04.934
 <I>Despite His Occasional</I>
 <I>Penchant For Women's Clothing,</I>

01:31:04.934 --> 01:31:09.234
 <I>Louis Ives Did Not Want</I>
 <I>To Transform Himself.</I>

01:31:09.234 --> 01:31:12.534
 <I>There Was No Woman</I>
 <I>Inside Him Dying To Get Out.</I>

01:31:12.534 --> 01:31:15.968
 <I>He Did Not Long</I>
 <I>To Be Beautiful Like Mary,</I>

01:31:15.968 --> 01:31:18.100
 <I>Or The Girls</I>
 <I>At Sally's. </I>

01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:21.000
 <I>This Was Not</I>
 <I>His Path To Love.</I>

01:31:23.434 --> 01:31:25.200
This Is Wrong.

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.434
- It's All Wrong.
- No!

01:31:27.434 --> 01:31:31.067
No. No, You Look
Really Nice!

01:31:31.067 --> 01:31:35.901
 <I>In Fact, Standing There</I>
 <I>Dressed As A Woman,</I>

01:31:35.901 --> 01:31:38.934
 <I>He Never Felt More</I>
 <I>Like A Man In His Life.</I>

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.300
What?

01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:43.300
What The Hell
Are You Doing?!

01:31:44.834 --> 01:31:47.133
I'm Sorry.
I Didn't Think
I Needed To Ask

01:31:47.133 --> 01:31:48.267
If I Was Paying!

01:31:48.267 --> 01:31:50.467
- What?!
- <I>Please, Stop Yelling.</I>

01:31:50.467 --> 01:31:51.868
- <I>You, Asshole!</I>
- What?

01:31:51.868 --> 01:31:54.601
- I Just Didn't Under--
- <I>What Is Happening Here?</I>

01:31:54.601 --> 01:31:55.968
Henry!

01:31:57.601 --> 01:31:59.801
What--
What Have You Done?

01:32:01.133 --> 01:32:03.968
- Get Out Of My Home!
- What's Going On?!

01:32:03.968 --> 01:32:05.234
- Go, Go!
- Shit!

01:32:05.234 --> 01:32:07.667
- Get Out Of My Home!
- <I>( Sandra SCREAMS )</I>

01:32:07.667 --> 01:32:09.934
- Get Out Of My Home!
- Sandra: <I>Freaks!</I>

01:32:09.934 --> 01:32:11.567
- Go. Go.
- Fucking Freaks!

01:32:11.567 --> 01:32:14.701
- Get Out!
- <I>Jesus Christ!</I>

01:32:14.701 --> 01:32:16.601
I Trusted You.

01:32:16.601 --> 01:32:18.868
I Trusted You.
I Trusted You.

01:32:18.868 --> 01:32:20.467
- Henry--
- <I>Here With Everything</I>
 <I> I Own.</I>

01:32:20.467 --> 01:32:23.000
Henry, I Didn't Know You
Were Coming Home So Soon.

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.767
 <I>I Had To.</I>

01:32:26.834 --> 01:32:29.000
Vivian Died.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.467
Oh My...

01:32:31.467 --> 01:32:32.734
 <I>God.</I>

01:32:32.734 --> 01:32:34.701
Henry, I'm Sorry.
I'm So Sorry.

01:32:34.701 --> 01:32:36.601
I Don't Want
Your Sympathy.

01:32:36.601 --> 01:32:38.701
- I Only Want Your Absence.
- <I>Henry, Please.</I>

01:32:40.834 --> 01:32:42.667
I'm Going For A Walk.

01:32:42.667 --> 01:32:46.400
I Want You
Out Of My Apartment
By The Time I Get Back.

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.467
Please Wait.
Can't You Just
For Once--

01:32:48.467 --> 01:32:49.501
Henry!

01:32:49.501 --> 01:32:51.767
Henry, I Don't Know
What To Say!

01:32:51.767 --> 01:32:55.000
Look, Obviously
I Have Some Issues!

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.634
Mmm.

01:32:56.634 --> 01:32:58.634
I Tried My Best
To Hide Them,

01:32:58.634 --> 01:33:02.200
Because I Desperately
Wanted Your Friendship.

01:33:03.601 --> 01:33:05.534
But The Real Truth Is

01:33:05.534 --> 01:33:08.601
 <I>I Don't Even</I>
 <I>Know Who You Are.</I>

01:33:08.601 --> 01:33:10.000
Nobody Seems To.

01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:38.767
- ( TIRES SQUEAL )
- ( SCREAMS )

01:33:38.767 --> 01:33:40.067
 <I>( CRASHES )</I>

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:53.300
Narrator:
 <I>As Louis Ives' Vehicle</I>
 <I>Was Hauled Away...</I>

01:33:54.868 --> 01:33:57.701
 <I>So Was His Entire</I>
 <I>Foundation.</I>

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:02.734
 <I>And For The First Time</I>
 <I>Since He Moved There, </I>

01:34:02.734 --> 01:34:05.100
 <I>Louis Ives Considered</I>

01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:07.968
 <I>Giving Up</I>
 <I>On Manhattan Altogether.</I>

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:34.067
( DOOR BUZZES )

01:35:03.434 --> 01:35:05.634
( SPEAKING SOFTLY )

01:35:07.801 --> 01:35:09.801
- Morning, Louis.
- Morning, George.

01:35:59.968 --> 01:36:02.133
Farewell, My Vivian.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.901
I Shall Always Be

01:36:09.901 --> 01:36:13.300
Your Most Devoted
Rosen Knight.

01:36:29.133 --> 01:36:30.767
( KNOCKS,
CLEARS THROAT )

01:36:30.767 --> 01:36:33.033
You Wanted
To See Me, George?

01:36:33.033 --> 01:36:35.801
Yeah. Yeah, I Did.
Sit Down Please, Louis.

01:36:41.634 --> 01:36:45.200
Is Something...
Wrong?

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.834
There's Just Something
I Need To Talk To You About.

01:36:47.834 --> 01:36:49.501
Okay.

01:36:49.501 --> 01:36:52.434
Louis, Phone Sales,

01:36:52.434 --> 01:36:54.634
They're Not Really
Right For You.

01:36:56.534 --> 01:36:58.434
- No?
- No.

01:36:58.434 --> 01:36:59.601
You're Just--

01:36:59.601 --> 01:37:02.000
You're Not The Right
Personality Type, Louis.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.334
Now Our Magazine
Is Doing--

01:37:04.334 --> 01:37:06.367
Is Doing Very Well,
You Know That.

01:37:06.367 --> 01:37:08.334
The Editing Staff
Can Barely Keep Up

01:37:08.334 --> 01:37:10.901
With All The Unsolicited
Manuscripts That Are
Coming In.

01:37:10.901 --> 01:37:13.067
So What I Would
Prefer To Do

01:37:13.067 --> 01:37:15.968
Is To Start You
Copy Editing.

01:37:17.167 --> 01:37:19.701
You've Got A Quiet,
Keen Insight, Louis.

01:37:19.701 --> 01:37:21.000
That's An Asset Here.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.634
We Should Groom You
As A Writer,

01:37:23.634 --> 01:37:25.567
 <I>Not As A Salesman.</I>

01:37:25.567 --> 01:37:27.334
I Guess What
I'm Saying Is,

01:37:27.334 --> 01:37:30.567
I'm Offering You
A Promotion.

01:37:37.267 --> 01:37:38.701
Mary:
 <I>Louis?</I>

01:37:38.701 --> 01:37:40.734
Louis, I Need
To Talk To You.

01:37:40.734 --> 01:37:44.501
I Was Thinking...

01:37:45.734 --> 01:37:48.634
And You Did Me
A Really Selfless Favor,

01:37:48.634 --> 01:37:51.534
And I Was Really Selfish
Not To Return It.

01:37:51.534 --> 01:37:52.601
Oh.

01:37:52.601 --> 01:37:55.200
So If You Still Need
A Date For That Wedding,

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:57.767
I Would Be Happy

01:37:57.767 --> 01:38:01.067
And Honored
To Fill That Position.

01:38:06.467 --> 01:38:08.234
Mary,

01:38:08.234 --> 01:38:10.634
I Really Appreciate

01:38:10.634 --> 01:38:12.467
You Offering
To Be My Date.

01:38:12.467 --> 01:38:14.300
But I'm Not Sure

01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:17.501
If It's The Best Thing
For Me Anymore.

01:38:18.567 --> 01:38:19.534
Really?

01:38:21.167 --> 01:38:23.934
Are You Throwing Those
Christmas Balls Out?

01:38:45.834 --> 01:38:47.801
 <I>Hello, Henry.</I>

01:38:49.601 --> 01:38:51.434
Look At Them,

01:38:51.434 --> 01:38:54.434
Strutting Around As If
They Own The Whole City...

01:38:55.868 --> 01:38:57.567
And Yet They're
Completely Dependent.

01:38:57.567 --> 01:38:58.901
Not A Pot To Piss In.

01:38:59.968 --> 01:39:03.300
Well, They Do Look
Awfully Proud.

01:39:06.334 --> 01:39:09.133
Henry, I Want To Apologize
For Last Night.

01:39:09.133 --> 01:39:13.367
You Are Always Apologizing.
Don't Be So Obsequious.

01:39:13.367 --> 01:39:15.501
It's Your Apartment.

01:39:15.501 --> 01:39:17.868
They're Your Rules.
I Broke Them.

01:39:17.868 --> 01:39:20.133
Yes...

01:39:20.133 --> 01:39:21.567
All That Is True.

01:39:21.567 --> 01:39:24.133
 <I>But I'm Not</I>
 <I>As Old Fashioned</I>
 <I>As You Think.</I>

01:39:26.467 --> 01:39:31.033
Does That Mean You're
Not Kicking Me Out For Good?

01:39:31.033 --> 01:39:32.567
Don't Be Ridiculous.

01:39:32.567 --> 01:39:35.868
You Did Kick Bellman
Out For Less.

01:39:35.868 --> 01:39:37.133
I Know.

01:39:37.133 --> 01:39:40.601
But There's
A Difference--

01:39:40.601 --> 01:39:42.868
It Would Be Sad
To Lose You.

01:39:51.901 --> 01:39:53.000
Hmm.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.100
But You Really Do
Need Help, You Know?

01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:56.801
You Might Think
About Going Over

01:39:56.801 --> 01:39:59.033
To The American Legion
For Counseling.

01:39:59.033 --> 01:40:00.267
Hmm.

01:40:00.267 --> 01:40:02.167
No, They'll Get
You Thinking Right.

01:40:02.167 --> 01:40:04.234
Actually, What I've
Decided To Do Is

01:40:04.234 --> 01:40:06.167
To Devote More Time
To Writing--

01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:08.100
Professionally
And Personally.

01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:10.367
I Think It May Be
Therapeutic.

01:40:10.367 --> 01:40:12.167
Good.
Yes, It Helps.

01:40:12.167 --> 01:40:16.133
But I Wouldn't Rule Out
Psychoanalysis Either.

01:40:16.133 --> 01:40:18.200
