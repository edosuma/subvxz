00:41.033 --> 00:44.337
My father used to say that
the reason for living

00:44.439 --> 00:47.808
was to get ready to
stay dead a long time.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.514
Where Jewel?

02:37.550 --> 02:40.385
I asked you where Jewel at?

02:43.156 --> 02:46.825
Down at the barn,
harnessing the team.

02:46.827 --> 02:51.164
Probably down there fooling
with that damn horse.

03:01.407 --> 03:03.375
Come here, sir.

03:03.810 --> 03:05.277
Come here.

04:18.817 --> 04:20.285
Dinner time.

04:23.857 --> 04:26.024
Come on.

04:28.328 --> 04:31.029
Come on, eat it up.

04:32.966 --> 04:36.202
Get that goddamn stuff out of sight
while you still got a chance.

04:37.004 --> 04:39.938
Pussel-gutted bastard.

04:45.378 --> 04:47.346
Sweet son of a bitch.

05:26.619 --> 05:27.419
What?

06:06.693 --> 06:08.627
You ready?

06:08.629 --> 06:10.395
Yeah, if you're all hitched up.

06:10.397 --> 06:16.736
You wait. If she don't last till you
get back, she gonna be disappointed.

06:17.738 --> 06:22.742
I gave her my word we'd keep the team
here and ready, in case she goes.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.544
Ma ain't that sick.

06:25.546 --> 06:26.678
That's right.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.848
She been acting more herself
today than all week.

06:29.850 --> 06:32.250
Yeah, well, you ought to know.

06:32.252 --> 06:36.088
Been coming around here often
enough looking at her.

06:36.090 --> 06:38.690
You and your folk
all neighbor like...

06:38.692 --> 06:41.626
Shut up, Jewel.

06:41.628 --> 06:46.631
If everybody wasn't burning hell
to get it done already, huh?

06:46.633 --> 06:51.370
With Cash under that
window all day long!

06:51.372 --> 06:53.071
Sawing...

06:53.073 --> 06:54.473
and hammering...

06:54.475 --> 06:56.475
It was her wish.

06:57.910 --> 07:02.115
She wanted to know it were her own blood
sawed the boards and drove the nails.

07:03.117 --> 07:06.651
Just like she want to
go in our own wagon.

07:06.653 --> 07:10.723
We will be beholden to
no man, me and her.

07:12.425 --> 07:16.462
It means three dollars.
You want us to go or not?

07:18.865 --> 07:21.566
I'm a luckless man.

07:23.169 --> 07:26.071
It fixing up to rain.

07:26.973 --> 07:29.174
Be back by sundown.

07:31.978 --> 07:34.079
Well...

07:37.617 --> 07:39.584
Well, come on!

07:41.888 --> 07:44.322
By sundown, you hear?

07:44.324 --> 07:47.726
I would not keep her waiting!

08:36.075 --> 08:39.344
What do you want, Darl?

08:39.346 --> 08:43.148
She gonna die
before we get back.

08:43.150 --> 08:46.351
Then why you going?

08:46.353 --> 08:48.753
It means three dollars.

08:48.755 --> 08:53.759
Why take Jewel?
You know he will never forgive you.

08:55.661 --> 08:58.296
She'll want to get
started right off.

08:58.298 --> 09:02.134
It's far enough to
Jefferson at best.

09:02.136 --> 09:04.035
Well, the road's good now.

09:04.037 --> 09:08.607
For now. We'll see
once the rain come.

09:10.743 --> 09:13.845
Funny how things work.
Addie's people...

09:13.847 --> 09:17.449
gotta be buried a day's
hard ride from here.

09:17.451 --> 09:20.982
Shame you can't just
go to your folks'

09:21.008 --> 09:25.056
ground in New Hope not
but three miles away.

09:25.058 --> 09:29.062
They'll be back in plenty of time.
I wouldn't worry none.

09:30.264 --> 09:34.065
Might be won't be no needs to
rush no ways.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.967
I hope it.

09:35.969 --> 09:37.869
She's going.

09:37.871 --> 09:40.605
Her mind is set on it.

09:44.110 --> 09:46.311
The Lord giveth

09:47.213 --> 09:49.414
The Lord giveth

09:53.953 --> 09:58.657
What you got there, boy, a hog?
Where you find that?

09:58.659 --> 10:00.325
Down at the bridge.

10:00.327 --> 10:01.860
You aim to leave it there?

10:01.862 --> 10:04.162
I aim to show it to Ma.

10:04.164 --> 10:05.363
You clean that fish.

10:05.365 --> 10:09.167
Can't Dewey Dell clean it?

10:09.169 --> 10:11.069
You clean it.

10:11.071 --> 10:12.704
How, Pa?

10:12.706 --> 10:14.239
You clean it.

10:21.547 --> 10:22.781
Go on now!

10:22.783 --> 10:24.783
It's bigger than him.

10:28.521 --> 10:29.821
Jewel!

10:37.830 --> 10:39.831
Jewel!

10:42.668 --> 10:47.205
Takes two people to make it...
one people to die.

10:47.207 --> 10:49.107
You know she's gonna
die, don't you?

10:49.109 --> 10:52.911
That's how the world will end.

10:52.913 --> 10:56.548
Which two made you two?

10:56.550 --> 11:00.352
She's gonna die,
Jewel, your mother.

11:01.954 --> 11:03.955
Our mother.

11:06.259 --> 11:08.927
Addie Bundren's gonna die.

11:14.367 --> 11:17.769
Just... breathe easy.

11:34.387 --> 11:37.489
Why didn't you call me sooner?

11:37.491 --> 11:42.494
Well, it was just one
thing and then another.

11:42.496 --> 11:46.831
That ere corn me and the boys
was hoping to get up with.

11:46.833 --> 11:50.602
Dewey Dell was taking
such good care of her.

11:50.604 --> 11:55.106
Folks was stopping by
offering to help and such.

11:55.108 --> 11:57.075
I just...

11:57.077 --> 11:58.610
Damnit, Anse.

12:02.615 --> 12:06.017
She's a' going, is she?

12:10.890 --> 12:12.357
I knowed it.

12:13.326 --> 12:17.162
I knowed her mind was set on it.

12:17.164 --> 12:18.630
Pa!

12:19.565 --> 12:21.766
You better go quick.

12:33.079 --> 12:34.646
Jewel!

12:51.397 --> 12:53.631
Wheel's stuck in the ditch!

12:53.633 --> 12:54.799
Damn!

12:55.901 --> 12:58.136
It's Jewel she wants.

12:58.138 --> 13:03.141
Why, Addie, him and Darl
went to make one more load.

13:03.143 --> 13:06.444
They thought there was time,
that you would wait for them.

13:06.446 --> 13:09.781
And that's three
dollar and all...

13:13.352 --> 13:14.819
Ma. Ma!

13:16.722 --> 13:19.924
Cash!!

13:53.459 --> 13:55.427
Get it up. Get it up.

13:55.429 --> 13:57.829
You got it? You got it?

13:57.831 --> 14:00.732
A little more. A little more!

14:04.203 --> 14:05.570
Hold on.

14:06.972 --> 14:07.472
You're on?

14:07.474 --> 14:09.374
Yeah, I think so.

14:09.376 --> 14:11.276
All right, hold it.

14:11.278 --> 14:14.012
All right. Get that bolt.

14:28.427 --> 14:31.796
You know she dead, Jewel.

14:37.036 --> 14:39.671
You know that, right?
Addie Bundren's dead?

14:39.673 --> 14:43.575
Just shut up! Shut up!

14:43.577 --> 14:46.478
Just shut your mouth!

15:09.969 --> 15:11.703
She's gone.

15:11.705 --> 15:14.672
She's taken and left us.

15:24.783 --> 15:28.152
How nigh are you done?

15:31.524 --> 15:35.660
I reckon you better
get back at it.

15:35.662 --> 15:38.796
You're gonna have to
do the best you can

15:38.798 --> 15:42.867
with them boys going
off that-a-way.

15:45.170 --> 15:48.873
Go on now, put supper on.

15:48.875 --> 15:52.243
We gotta keep our strength up.

16:37.723 --> 16:40.625
God's will be done.

16:45.864 --> 16:49.267
Now I can get them teeth.

17:21.400 --> 17:26.104
<i>You could do so much for
me, if you just would.</i>

17:26.106 --> 17:28.306
<i>If you just knew.</i>

17:28.308 --> 17:31.409
<i>If you just would then
I could tell you...</i>

17:31.411 --> 17:35.614
<i>and then nobody's have to know
it, except for you and me.</i>

17:36.616 --> 17:38.116
<i>And Darl.</i>

17:46.125 --> 17:48.126
You all right?

18:42.214 --> 18:48.253
Where she gonna go? Do you think
she'll still go as far as town?

18:50.589 --> 18:53.257
She went farther than town.

19:49.481 --> 19:51.883
She's in upside down.

19:51.885 --> 19:56.388
Told you she loved that dress.
Don't want it wrinkled.

20:05.731 --> 20:08.099
I made it on the bevel.

20:08.101 --> 20:11.235
One, there's more gripping
surface for the nails.

20:11.237 --> 20:16.241
Two, there's twice the
gripping surface to each seam.

20:16.943 --> 20:21.245
Three, the water will have
to seep in at a slant.

20:21.247 --> 20:24.348
Water moves easiest up
and down than sideways.

20:24.350 --> 20:28.853
Four, in a house were people are
upright two thirds of the time...

20:28.855 --> 20:32.690
the seams and joints are
built up and down...

20:32.692 --> 20:35.092
because the stress
is up and down.

20:35.094 --> 20:40.097
Five, in a bed where people
lay down all the time...

20:40.099 --> 20:44.602
the joints and seams go sideways
because the stress is sideways.

20:44.604 --> 20:47.371
Six, except.

20:47.373 --> 20:49.240
Seven...

20:49.242 --> 20:53.778
a human body is not
like a crosstie.

20:53.780 --> 20:56.914
Eight, animal magnetism.

20:56.916 --> 21:00.718
Nine, the animal magnetism
of a human body...

21:00.720 --> 21:03.120
makes the stress
come slanting...

21:03.122 --> 21:06.224
so a coffin is built
on the bevel.

21:06.226 --> 21:08.559
Ten, if you look at
an old grave site...

21:08.561 --> 21:11.896
you'll see where the earth is
sucked towards the bevel.

21:11.898 --> 21:14.298
Eleven, while on a
natural hole...

21:14.300 --> 21:18.102
it sinks toward the middle, the
stress being up and down.

21:18.104 --> 21:21.205
Twelve, so I made it on a bevel.

21:21.207 --> 21:25.210
Thirteen, it makes a neater job.

21:27.179 --> 21:29.580
That river is up and rising.

21:29.582 --> 21:34.585
It's already covered the highest water mark
on that bridge piling that I've ever seen.

21:34.587 --> 21:38.422
That bridge won't stand a whole
lot of water. Anybody told Anse?

21:38.424 --> 21:41.525
I told him. He said he reckoned
them boys had already heard

21:41.527 --> 21:44.161
and unloaded, and was on the way
back by now.

21:44.163 --> 21:46.564
He better bury her at New Hope.

21:46.566 --> 21:49.166
That bridge is old. I wouldn't
monkey with it.

21:49.168 --> 21:52.270
Yeah, well his mind is set
on taking her to Jefferson.

21:52.272 --> 21:54.672
Well, he had better
get at it soon.

21:54.674 --> 21:57.308
It's been there quite a long
time, that there bridge.

21:57.310 --> 21:59.877
The Lord kept it
there, you mean.

21:59.879 --> 22:02.280
Peabody, you was the
first guy to cross it.

22:02.282 --> 22:05.283
You was on the way over to our
house, see My sweetheart

22:05.285 --> 22:07.618
give birth to our
first son, Jody.

22:07.620 --> 22:10.922
If I would'a crossed it every
time she littered since

22:10.924 --> 22:14.258
it'd be worn out
long before this.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.030
The Lord giveth.

22:19.032 --> 22:21.232
-The Lord giveth.

22:26.638 --> 22:29.340
Where that rail run?

22:48.560 --> 22:51.295
My mother is a fish.

23:33.739 --> 23:37.141
His grace be upon this house!

23:37.609 --> 23:39.043
Anse.

23:42.347 --> 23:46.851
She going to a better place.

23:46.853 --> 23:51.155
♪ Shall we gather at the river

23:51.157 --> 23:55.893

feet have trod ♪

♪ Soon our pilgrimage will cease

24:45.777 --> 24:47.445
Hey, Jewel!

24:50.782 --> 24:53.484
Look at them.

24:55.787 --> 24:59.457
Goddamn you. Goddamn him!

25:09.134 --> 25:12.236
I know your mother was
Addie Bundren, Jewel

25:12.238 --> 25:14.438
<i>same as mine.</i>

25:15.340 --> 25:18.442
But who was your father?

25:18.444 --> 25:22.246
And as long as I can
recall who it isn't...

25:22.248 --> 25:24.448
<i>but who it is.</i>

25:26.084 --> 25:28.752
I still don't know.

25:40.432 --> 25:42.299
It ain't gonna balance.

25:42.301 --> 25:46.637
If you want it to tote
and ride on a balance...

25:46.639 --> 25:51.710
Pick up your goddamn your thick-
nosed soul to hell and pick up!

25:53.745 --> 25:54.945
- Easy, Jewel.

25:54.947 --> 25:56.847
Jewel, I'm telling you!

25:56.849 --> 25:58.749
She will not tote and ride...

25:58.751 --> 26:00.584
Easy!

26:00.586 --> 26:03.487
Come on! Come on!

26:05.891 --> 26:07.057
Pick it up!

26:07.059 --> 26:09.426
Watch the stairs!

26:09.428 --> 26:11.495
No, pick up! Pick up your end!

26:11.497 --> 26:12.730
Watch it!

26:12.732 --> 26:13.931
Come on, Cash!

26:13.933 --> 26:15.132
Watch it!

26:15.134 --> 26:16.634
Let loose, Cash!

26:16.636 --> 26:18.335
Watch it! Watch it!

26:18.337 --> 26:20.538
Pick up! Pick up!

26:23.108 --> 26:26.177
Watch it, Jewel!

26:42.694 --> 26:44.728
She's backwards.

26:49.501 --> 26:53.837
Jewel! You leave that horse
here, you hear me?

26:53.839 --> 26:58.142
We all go in the wagon with your
Ma, like she wanted.

26:58.144 --> 27:04.249
Not with you prancing around like a
darn circus animal on that horse.

27:05.251 --> 27:07.952
My mother's a fish.

27:09.020 --> 27:12.856
Yeah. Jewel's mother's a horse.

27:12.858 --> 27:15.960
And what's your Ma, Darl?

27:15.962 --> 27:19.063
I ain't got one.

27:19.065 --> 27:20.764
Why you got them tools?

27:20.766 --> 27:24.568
'Cause I aim to stop off
at Tull's on the way home

27:24.570 --> 27:26.637
and get that roof
up on that barn.

27:26.639 --> 27:31.643
It ain't respectful. That's
deliberate flouting of her and of me.

27:32.345 --> 27:34.578
Where your sister?

27:40.685 --> 27:42.386
What's that?

27:42.388 --> 27:44.255
Mr. Tull's cakes.

27:44.257 --> 27:46.857
Taking them to town, Pa.

27:46.859 --> 27:48.559
It ain't right.

27:48.561 --> 27:52.396
It's flouting of the dead.

27:52.398 --> 27:56.700
And there's little enough
for you do to do for her.

27:56.702 --> 28:01.205
What sprung hell from her
own flesh and blood.

28:01.207 --> 28:05.043
Then go on. Leave him
stay if he wants to.

28:09.547 --> 28:12.049
Pepper!

28:47.552 --> 28:50.988
It's a hard country on man.

28:52.057 --> 28:55.192
Nowhere in this sinful world

28:55.194 --> 28:59.596
can a honest,
hard-working man profit.

28:59.598 --> 29:03.300
It takes them that run the
stores in the towns...

29:03.302 --> 29:07.104
doing no sweating,
doing no sweating...

29:07.106 --> 29:09.440
living off them that sweat.

29:09.442 --> 29:13.478
It ain't the hard-working
man, the farmer.

29:14.480 --> 29:18.816
Sometimes I wonder
why I keep at it.

29:18.818 --> 29:22.586
It's because there's a
reward for us above...

29:22.588 --> 29:26.423
where they can't take their
autos and such.

29:26.425 --> 29:30.027
Everyone will be equal there.

29:30.029 --> 29:33.330
And it will be taken
from them that have...

29:33.332 --> 29:38.403
and give to them that
have not by the Lord.

29:39.605 --> 29:43.640
But it seems like a long ways.

29:57.222 --> 29:59.623
I told them it wasn't balanced.

29:59.625 --> 30:02.025
They should'a let me
put it on a balance.

30:02.027 --> 30:05.295
Yeah, maybe so, but we
done waited long enough.

30:05.297 --> 30:08.699
Especially in this heat.

30:30.221 --> 30:33.624
Hey! Jewel!

30:38.863 --> 30:41.465
I don't expect you to
have no respect for me...

30:41.467 --> 30:45.102
but with your own Ma not
cold in her coffin yet.

30:45.104 --> 30:48.405
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you...

30:48.407 --> 30:50.340
Jewel!

30:50.342 --> 30:52.776
I don't know how many
times I told you...

30:52.778 --> 30:57.281
it's doing such things makes
folks talk about you.

30:57.283 --> 30:58.782
Come on!

31:10.128 --> 31:14.666
Darl knew. He knew this
and he knew before.

31:15.868 --> 31:21.105
He knew the first time me and
Lafe picked on down the row.

31:22.107 --> 31:27.612
We'd picked on down the row, the
woods getting closer and closer

31:28.514 --> 31:30.914
and the secret shade.

31:30.916 --> 31:35.620
Picking on into the secret shade
with my sack and Lafe's sack.

31:36.622 --> 31:40.224
Because I said, will I or won't
I when the sack was full?

31:40.226 --> 31:44.761
'Cause I said, if the sack's full when we
get to the woods, then it won't be me.

31:44.763 --> 31:47.164
I said, if it don't
mean for me to do it

31:47.166 --> 31:50.667
the sack will not be full and I
will turn up the next row.

31:50.669 --> 31:54.438
But if the sack is full, then I
cannot help it.

31:54.440 --> 31:59.443
And so it was, because
I could not help it.

31:59.445 --> 32:00.978
He was in.

32:18.062 --> 32:21.698
And then I saw
Darl, and he knew.

32:23.301 --> 32:25.569
He said he knew
without the words

32:25.571 --> 32:28.872
like he told me that Ma was
gonna die without words.

32:28.874 --> 32:31.975
And I knew he knew 'cause he
said he knew with the words.

32:31.977 --> 32:35.279
I would not have believed that
he had been there and saw us.

32:35.281 --> 32:38.181
But he said he did know.

32:38.183 --> 32:42.486
And I said, "Are you gonna tell
Pa? Are you gonna kill him?"

32:42.488 --> 32:47.625
Without the words I said it.
And he said, "Why?" without the words

32:48.427 --> 32:51.495
Why not admit it?

32:51.497 --> 32:53.430
You know it's true.

32:53.432 --> 32:57.734
Even if it's just to yourself.

32:57.736 --> 33:00.837
The relief you feel.

33:00.839 --> 33:02.739
You needed her to die
so that you could

33:02.741 --> 33:06.176
go to town and get it done.

33:15.853 --> 33:19.991
And that's why I can talk to
him with knowing and hating

33:21.526 --> 33:23.794
'cause he knows.

33:25.463 --> 33:29.600
Couple of days now,
it'll be smelling.

33:33.605 --> 33:37.642
You might tell Jewel that,
he'd like to hear it.

33:38.644 --> 33:42.446
It ain't balanced for
no long ride neither.

33:42.448 --> 33:45.849
You can tell him that, too.

33:57.962 --> 34:00.631
We're going to use your bridge!

34:00.633 --> 34:03.000
Bridge is out!

34:03.002 --> 34:04.234
Louder!

34:04.236 --> 34:06.937
The bridge is out!

34:09.206 --> 34:11.942
We'll be all right.

34:28.626 --> 34:31.962
How about use the one
across at Samson's?

34:31.964 --> 34:33.196
Yeah.

34:33.197 --> 34:35.032
That bridge is gone.

34:35.034 --> 34:36.766
Like this?

34:36.768 --> 34:39.369
Worse. It's gone entire.

34:39.371 --> 34:41.271
What now?

34:41.273 --> 34:42.973
I guess we ford here.

34:42.975 --> 34:46.076
If it was just up, we
could drive across.

34:46.078 --> 34:48.679
We could just drive
right on across it.

34:48.681 --> 34:50.580
That's where the ford was.

34:50.581 --> 34:51.882
That don't show nothing.

34:51.884 --> 34:54.918
That could be a bar of
quicksand built up there.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.820
Mr. Wheatfield crossed it.

34:56.822 --> 34:59.222
On horseback. Two days ago.

34:59.224 --> 35:01.825
It's raised five
foot since then.

35:01.827 --> 35:03.727
Mr. Wheatfield crossed it.

35:03.729 --> 35:05.262
If the bridge was just up.

35:05.264 --> 35:07.898
But it's not, is it?

35:07.900 --> 35:12.536
I bet you a careful fella could walk
across on those planks and those logs.

35:13.238 --> 35:15.639
Yeah, but you ain't
gonna tote nothing.

35:15.641 --> 35:18.508
Likely you put a foot on that
mess, the whole thing go too.

35:18.510 --> 35:23.447
I gave her my promised word
in the presence of the Lord.

35:23.449 --> 35:26.717
I reckon it'll cross fine.

35:26.719 --> 35:29.319
It probably start
falling come the night.

35:29.321 --> 35:31.521
You can lay over a day.

35:31.523 --> 35:34.224
You should get the hell back
to your own damn plowing.

35:34.226 --> 35:37.461
Ain't nobody asked you to follow
us here.

35:37.463 --> 35:39.129
Never meant no harm.

35:39.131 --> 35:40.764
Why don't you shut up, Jewel.

35:40.766 --> 35:43.433
Yeah, shut up, Jewel.

35:49.540 --> 35:51.575
What you wanna do?

35:52.477 --> 35:56.980
If the bridge was just up,
we could drive across it.

35:56.982 --> 35:59.916
What you say, Cash?

36:02.019 --> 36:06.323
Dewey Dell and
Vardaman and Pa...

36:06.325 --> 36:08.892
they all better walk
across on foot.

36:08.894 --> 36:12.863
He's right. Vernon
can help them.

36:16.067 --> 36:18.068
Come on.

36:22.273 --> 36:24.474
You go with them.

36:24.476 --> 36:27.778
We'll go on down the ford, meet
you on the other side.

36:27.780 --> 36:30.413
I don't advise it.

36:30.415 --> 36:32.816
Come on, Vardaman.

36:32.818 --> 36:35.919
I gave her my word!

36:35.921 --> 36:39.055
It is sacred on me.

36:39.057 --> 36:41.658
I know you begrudge it...

36:41.660 --> 36:45.962
but she will bless
you in heaven.

36:45.964 --> 36:50.967
This is fool's work. Y'all
should'a laid over a day.

36:50.969 --> 36:54.805
Water's gonna go down,
ain't gonna rain no more.

36:54.807 --> 36:57.207
Surely ain't gonna
get no higher.

36:57.209 --> 37:02.446
It's the turning back. It ain't
no luck in turning back.

37:03.448 --> 37:08.019
I give her my word.
She's a-counting on it.

37:25.570 --> 37:29.172
The dark current runs.

37:29.174 --> 37:31.775
Talks up to us in a murmur...

37:31.777 --> 37:34.678
become ceaseless and myriad.

37:34.680 --> 37:38.682
Fading swirls move along the
surface for an instant...

37:38.684 --> 37:41.084
silent, impermanent...

37:41.086 --> 37:42.986
profoundly significant...

37:42.988 --> 37:46.323
as though something just
beneath the surface...

37:46.325 --> 37:48.725
huge and alive...

37:48.727 --> 37:51.394
was waked for a moment.

37:53.731 --> 37:57.133
I reckon we're
still on the road.

37:59.237 --> 38:03.039
Tull taken and cut down
those two big white oaks.

38:03.041 --> 38:05.642
I hear tell, at high
water in the old days...

38:05.644 --> 38:08.478
people used to ford
by those trees.

38:08.480 --> 38:11.414
If I'd suspicioned it, I
coulda come out here last week

38:11.416 --> 38:14.217
and taken sight of it.

38:14.219 --> 38:17.687
There's no way we coulda knowed.

38:17.689 --> 38:20.423
What do you want me to do?

38:26.898 --> 38:29.299
All right, I'm gonna
go on ahead...

38:29.301 --> 38:33.436
and y'all just follow
where I am, okay?

38:36.240 --> 38:39.442
I ain't gonna let nothing
happen to you. okay.

38:39.444 --> 38:43.480
It's just you and me. I ain't
gonna let nothing happen to you.

38:43.482 --> 38:45.448
Come on. Come on.

38:47.752 --> 38:50.453
Come on. Come on now.

39:05.503 --> 39:08.204
Guys! This way!

39:09.040 --> 39:13.643
Guys, here!
The ford is over here!

39:18.616 --> 39:21.685
This is it, Jewel! Right here!

39:21.687 --> 39:23.720
Wait! Jewel, wait!

39:24.822 --> 39:26.823
It ain't on a balance!

39:26.825 --> 39:30.664
Well, then go back and walk on the
goddamn bridge, both you and Darl!

39:30.690 --> 39:31.761
You let me on that!

39:31.763 --> 39:34.197
Ride back and cross, too!
Walk across the bridge...

39:34.199 --> 39:38.868
and meet us on the other bank with the rope,
and then Vernon will take your horse!

39:38.870 --> 39:40.770
- There's some loose logs!

39:40.772 --> 39:42.472
- Yeah, you go to hell!

39:42.474 --> 39:44.874
Take the rope around
the other bank!

39:44.876 --> 39:48.378
Three ain't no better than two.
We got one to drive and one to balance.

39:48.380 --> 39:51.281
I don't care what we do just so
long as we do something!

39:51.283 --> 39:53.683
Sitting here not doing
a goddamn thing!

39:53.685 --> 39:58.088
Take the rope and meet us on the other side!
Can you do that jewel?

39:58.090 --> 40:01.858
You might as well hop off now and go
across the bridge, too, if you want.

40:01.860 --> 40:04.861
I'll stay. Might take two of us.

40:04.863 --> 40:05.729
Watch yourself!

40:05.731 --> 40:07.831
I'm on it! Come on!

40:07.833 --> 40:12.002
Come on! Come on then, you can
come to me, all right?

40:12.004 --> 40:13.370
Come on!

40:13.372 --> 40:14.637
Watch it! Log!

40:14.639 --> 40:16.606
Jewel! Let the rope go!

40:16.608 --> 40:18.141
Go! Go!

41:47.665 --> 41:51.701
I used to hear the dark
land talking God's love...

41:51.703 --> 41:54.637
His beauty and His sin.

41:54.639 --> 41:59.142
Hearing the dark voicelessness
in which words are deeds

41:59.144 --> 42:02.112
and the other words
that are not deeds

42:02.114 --> 42:06.717
just the gaps in people's lack
coming down like the cries of the

42:07.819 --> 42:12.990
geese in the wild darkness in
the old terrible nights.

42:16.093 --> 42:20.531
Anse had a word, too.
Love, he called it.

42:21.433 --> 42:25.969
But I had been used to
words for a long time.

42:25.971 --> 42:30.273
I knew that word was
like the others.

42:30.275 --> 42:34.410
Just a shape to fill a lack.

42:47.224 --> 42:49.826
When I knew that I had Cash...

42:49.828 --> 42:52.729
I knew that life was terrible

42:52.731 --> 42:57.300
and that this was
the answer to it.

42:57.302 --> 43:01.604
That was when I learned
that words are no good.

43:01.606 --> 43:06.310
Words don't ever fit even what
they are trying to say at.

43:07.112 --> 43:11.215
When he was borned, I knew
motherhood was invented by someone

43:12.217 --> 43:14.617
who had to have a word for it

43:14.619 --> 43:17.220
Because the ones that
had the children...

43:17.222 --> 43:22.225
didn't care if there was
a word for it or not.

43:22.227 --> 43:27.498
Sometimes I would lay
by him in the dark...

43:28.500 --> 43:33.504
hearing the dark land that was
now of my blood and flesh

43:34.206 --> 43:37.807
and I would think, "Anse."

43:37.809 --> 43:40.710
"Why Anse? Why is he Anse?"

43:40.712 --> 43:45.215
And I would think about his
name until, after a while

43:45.217 --> 43:48.518
I could see the
word as a shape...

43:48.520 --> 43:50.753
a vessel.

43:50.755 --> 43:55.258
I would watch him liquefy
and flow into it...

43:55.260 --> 43:59.862
until the jar stood full and
motionless.

44:08.405 --> 44:11.474
I told Cora one day...

44:11.476 --> 44:16.479
that he was my cross, and
he would be my salvation.

44:16.481 --> 44:20.617
He would save me from
the water and the fire.

44:21.518 --> 44:24.821
Even though I had
laid down my life...

44:24.823 --> 44:26.823
he would save me.

44:28.225 --> 44:33.864
She told me it was sinful when she
realized how we were talking about God.

44:34.666 --> 44:39.303
But sin and love and
fear are just sounds

44:40.205 --> 44:45.709
that people who have never sinned
nor loved nor feared, have.

44:46.511 --> 44:51.014
But what they never
had, and cannot have...

44:51.016 --> 44:55.318
until they forget the words.

44:55.320 --> 44:58.421
She wanted me to pray,
ask for forgiveness...

44:58.423 --> 45:04.027
because to people to whom sin
is just a matter of words

45:04.729 --> 45:08.866
to them, "salvation"
is just words, too.

45:15.306 --> 45:19.642
I would think of him
as dressed in sin.

45:19.644 --> 45:24.080
I would think of him
as thinking of me...

45:24.082 --> 45:26.149
as dressed also in sin.

45:26.151 --> 45:28.551
Even more beautiful...

45:28.553 --> 45:33.190
because the garment he exchanged
for sin was sanctified.

45:36.727 --> 45:41.765
I would think of the sin as
garments which we would remove.

45:43.834 --> 45:46.536
And then it was over.

45:57.114 --> 46:00.249
He gave me jewel.

46:00.251 --> 46:03.820
And jewel was my salvation.

46:06.390 --> 46:10.460
His grace be upon this house!

46:48.298 --> 46:51.000
He got the saw, Cash!

46:51.935 --> 46:56.472
I got the rule! Found the rule,
Cash!

46:56.474 --> 46:59.142
He got your saw, Cash!

47:00.277 --> 47:02.478
He got your saw!

47:25.269 --> 47:28.004
I'm going to Armstid's.

47:28.505 --> 47:30.706
Give cash help.

47:40.417 --> 47:43.553
After school was out and
the last one had left

47:43.555 --> 47:48.124
with his dirty little
snuffling nose

47:48.126 --> 47:50.726
instead of going home, I
would go down the hill

47:50.728 --> 47:54.564
to the spring where
I could be quiet

47:54.566 --> 47:56.766
and hate them.

47:57.701 --> 48:01.504
I would have to look at
them day after day...

48:01.506 --> 48:06.309
each with his and her
sacred selfish thought.

48:06.311 --> 48:10.279
And I would look forward to
the times when they faulted

48:10.281 --> 48:13.149
so I could whip them.

48:13.151 --> 48:18.154
When the switch fell, I could
feel it upon my flesh.

48:18.156 --> 48:22.892
When it welted and ridged
it was my blood that ran...

48:22.894 --> 48:26.696
and I would think with
each blow of the switch:

48:26.698 --> 48:28.998
Now you are aware of me!

48:31.802 --> 48:34.904
Doc Peabody had gone down
below Inverness somewhere...

48:34.906 --> 48:38.708
but Uncle Billy's coming.
He's a horse doctor.

48:38.710 --> 48:42.011
But he's about the
closer we come now.

48:42.013 --> 48:44.413
Well...

48:44.415 --> 48:47.517
what y'all thinking?

48:50.354 --> 48:53.256
In here, Uncle Billy.

49:05.636 --> 49:09.672
What you been into now, boy?

49:14.177 --> 49:18.014
All right, get me a chair
and a big glass of whiskey.

49:18.016 --> 49:22.318
Lucky for him, that were the
same leg he broke last summer.

49:22.320 --> 49:26.289
Me and you might got a different
notion of what's lucky.

49:26.291 --> 49:28.257
I reckon I get your point.

49:28.259 --> 49:29.659
But can you help him?

49:29.661 --> 49:33.963
Well, men ain't so different
from a horse or a mule...

49:33.965 --> 49:35.064
except maybe...

49:35.066 --> 49:39.269
horse or a mule might
have a little more sense.

49:41.605 --> 49:44.340
I want you to drink this.

49:46.143 --> 49:48.844
All of it.

49:50.247 --> 49:54.750
It's okay to holler, boy, if
you feel like you need to.

49:54.752 --> 49:57.420
All right, need some
help holding him down.

49:57.422 --> 50:00.489
Hold him down. Hold him still.

50:00.491 --> 50:04.827
Hold him still.
Put a bite on him.

50:04.829 --> 50:07.463
Bite on it. Put the rag in
your mouth and bite on it.

50:07.465 --> 50:09.632
Bite. All right.

50:10.567 --> 50:12.768
Is he all right?

50:35.125 --> 50:39.228
He's all right.

50:39.230 --> 50:44.100
I'm gonna need some help with
these splints while he's out.

51:05.989 --> 51:08.758
You're welcome to
the use of my team.

51:08.760 --> 51:12.528
I thank you, but she'll
want to go in ourn.

51:12.530 --> 51:14.930
Well...

51:14.932 --> 51:18.701
You might wanna
think about Snopes.

51:18.703 --> 51:21.837
He's got three, four span.

51:21.839 --> 51:24.440
Maybe one of them'd suit you.

51:24.442 --> 51:27.543
He a close man to trade with.

51:27.545 --> 51:29.078
Yeah

51:31.181 --> 51:35.284
But I reckon I can
talk him around.

51:46.963 --> 51:49.865
How does it taste, huh?

52:23.900 --> 52:27.036
Go! Get outta here! Leave! Go!

52:27.038 --> 52:31.540
Go! Go! Get outta here! Shoo!

52:31.542 --> 52:34.276
Get off! Go! Shoo! Shoo!

52:35.378 --> 52:38.414
Get out of here! Just go!

52:38.416 --> 52:40.816
Git! Shoo!

52:40.818 --> 52:44.954
Go! Go! shoo! Shoo!

52:45.889 --> 52:48.624
Go! Leave my Mama alone! Go!

52:48.626 --> 52:52.996
You've got to do something. It's an outrage.
He should be lawed for treating her so.

52:53.898 --> 52:56.499
He's getting her in the
ground best he can.

52:56.501 --> 52:58.901
Dear Lord! That smell!

52:58.903 --> 53:02.338
You have to do something.

53:12.215 --> 53:14.884
Anse! Anse!

53:15.619 --> 53:17.820
He's gone.

53:18.221 --> 53:20.422
Where's Anse?

53:20.424 --> 53:23.726
Done light out this morning trade
for a new team with Snopes.

53:23.728 --> 53:26.328
How'd he get there?

53:26.330 --> 53:28.330
Jewel's horse.

53:29.966 --> 53:34.436
I didn't think he'd ever let
nobody else touch that beast.

53:34.438 --> 53:37.873
Never has.

53:39.476 --> 53:44.280
I don't mean no offense, but...

53:44.282 --> 53:48.417
smell, smell's
getting pretty bad.

53:50.720 --> 53:52.922
I know.

53:55.725 --> 53:57.660
Come on eat now.

53:57.662 --> 54:00.062
You, too, Jewel.

54:00.064 --> 54:02.965
Jewel, come on eat!

54:33.363 --> 54:35.030
Pa's home!

54:38.368 --> 54:40.369
Got us a team.

54:40.770 --> 54:43.005
Got a team from Snopes?

54:43.007 --> 54:48.010
I reckon Snopes ain't the only fella
in this town itching to drive a trade.

54:48.012 --> 54:52.715
A fella that just beat Snopes in a
trade ought to feel pretty darn good.

54:52.717 --> 54:55.618
What you give him, Anse?

54:55.620 --> 55:00.122
I give him a chattel mortgage on
my seeder and cultivator.

55:00.124 --> 55:03.926
That ain't worth more than $40.

55:03.928 --> 55:06.528
I give other things.

55:06.530 --> 55:08.931
What other things?

55:08.933 --> 55:11.300
Other things.

55:11.302 --> 55:14.870
That's what he was doing in
Cash's clothes last night.

55:14.872 --> 55:19.409
You know he was planning to buy
that talking machine from Suratt.

55:20.311 --> 55:23.212
That's just $8.

55:23.214 --> 55:27.349
That ain't enough to
buy another team.

55:31.054 --> 55:34.156
Lord knows...

55:34.158 --> 55:37.593
if there were ere a man.

55:46.836 --> 55:49.538
And the horse.

55:52.509 --> 55:55.044
What horse?

55:55.046 --> 55:59.216
We give him the horse right
after we bury your mother.

56:03.119 --> 56:06.422
You mean, you think
you swapped my horse?

56:06.424 --> 56:07.723
My horse?

56:10.694 --> 56:13.095
Five months hard work...

56:13.097 --> 56:17.700
clear near 40 acres of
Quick's field to earn it.

56:21.905 --> 56:26.909
For 15 year I ain't had
a tooth in my head.

56:27.611 --> 56:29.311
Lord knows...

56:29.313 --> 56:33.615
for 15 year He know that I
ain't had the victuals...

56:33.617 --> 56:38.321
that He aimed for man to eat
to keep his strength up.

56:39.323 --> 56:43.125
And me saving a nickel
here and a nickel there...

56:43.127 --> 56:47.163
so my family wouldn't
suffer it, to buy them!

56:48.165 --> 56:52.434
And I thought that if I
could do without eating...

56:52.436 --> 56:55.771
my son could do without riding!

56:55.773 --> 56:57.740
God knows I did!

57:18.361 --> 57:19.628
Hell

57:33.410 --> 57:35.377
Come on. Up!

57:46.456 --> 57:50.959
Where's Jewel?
We can't leave without Jewel.

57:50.961 --> 57:52.594
Jewel disappeared
with his horse.

57:52.596 --> 57:56.899
Be the last time we see
Jewel, sure enough.

57:56.901 --> 58:00.702
Maybe they get a postcard from
him down in Texas, I reckon.

58:00.704 --> 58:05.240
Anse Bundren is an
outrage against decency.

58:05.242 --> 58:09.812
I be darn if he ain't a sight.

58:22.125 --> 58:25.227
How you feeling, Cash?

58:25.229 --> 58:27.162
It don't bother none.

58:27.164 --> 58:30.599
You want me to prop it up some?

58:41.744 --> 58:42.711
You all right?

58:42.713 --> 58:44.146
It's just on a bump...

58:44.148 --> 58:47.249
it kinda grinds together
a little bit on a bump.

58:47.251 --> 58:49.151
But it don't bother nothing.

58:49.153 --> 58:52.955
Is it because Jewel's
mother is a horse, Darl?

58:52.957 --> 58:54.223
Is that why he went away?

58:54.225 --> 58:55.357
That's part of it.

58:55.359 --> 58:57.993
Hey, Cash, you want
me to tighten this?

58:57.995 --> 59:00.596
If you just would.

59:00.598 --> 59:01.797
That hurt?

59:01.799 --> 59:05.634
Maybe just put it back down.

59:05.636 --> 59:06.835
Hurt?

59:06.837 --> 59:09.238
It don't bother none.

59:09.240 --> 59:11.106
You want Pa to slow down?

59:11.108 --> 59:14.009
No. There's no point
in slowing down now.

59:14.011 --> 59:17.112
It don't bother nothing.

59:17.114 --> 59:20.215
I reckon we gotta get
him some medicine.

59:20.217 --> 59:23.318
There ain't no way around it.

59:23.320 --> 59:26.255
Just tell him to go on.

59:35.098 --> 59:39.601
Them cakes is gonna be nice by
the time we get to Jefferson.

59:39.603 --> 59:43.907
You best sell them in Mottson,
if you know what I'm saying.

59:46.075 --> 59:48.477
When will we get
to Mottson, Darl?

59:48.479 --> 59:53.482
Tomorrow. If this team don't
step itself to pieces.

59:53.484 --> 59:57.286
I think Snopes fed
them on sawdust.

59:57.288 --> 01:00:01.423
Why did he feed them
on sawdust, Darl?

01:00:03.026 --> 01:00:05.727
Look.

01:01:41.924 --> 01:01:45.527
I couldn't see. I couldn't feel.

01:01:45.529 --> 01:01:47.796
I couldn't feel
the bed under me.

01:01:47.798 --> 01:01:50.899
And I couldn't think
of where I was.

01:01:50.901 --> 01:01:54.703
I couldn't think of my name.
I couldn't even think I am a girl...

01:01:54.705 --> 01:01:58.774
but I knew that something was.
But I couldn't even think of time

01:01:58.776 --> 01:02:04.780
Then, all of a sudden,
I knew that something was.

01:02:05.582 --> 01:02:09.618
It was wind blowing over me.

01:02:11.187 --> 01:02:14.589
I believe in God.
I believe in God.

01:02:15.491 --> 01:02:18.827
I believe in God.
I believe in God.

01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:21.229
God, I believe in God.

01:02:21.231 --> 01:02:24.900
I believe in God.
I believe in God.

01:02:24.902 --> 01:02:28.670
I believe in God.

01:02:50.326 --> 01:02:54.830
Gonna hawl a little.
Gonna hawl a little.

01:02:54.832 --> 01:02:57.566
Pepper! Pepper!

01:03:02.305 --> 01:03:05.707
Dewey, make it quick.

01:03:17.286 --> 01:03:21.390
Where you going?
Where she going?

01:03:32.301 --> 01:03:35.237
What can I do for you?

01:03:35.239 --> 01:03:39.941
You looking for some toilet things,
or is it medicine you want?

01:03:39.943 --> 01:03:41.610
That's it?

01:03:41.612 --> 01:03:44.513
I'd rather go back there.

01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:48.817
All right.

01:04:01.697 --> 01:04:07.303
What's the trouble? Tell me what
it is you want. I'm pretty busy.

01:04:08.105 --> 01:04:09.805
It's a female trouble.

01:04:09.807 --> 01:04:14.776
Is that all? Where's your Ma?
Haven't you got one?

01:04:14.778 --> 01:04:17.179
She's out yonder in the wagon.

01:04:17.181 --> 01:04:20.982
Why don't you talk to her about
it before you take any medicine?

01:04:20.984 --> 01:04:25.821
I mean, any woman would
tell you about it.

01:04:27.924 --> 01:04:32.427
Are you too regular or
not regular enough?

01:04:32.429 --> 01:04:36.231
Yes, I reckon so. Yes.

01:04:36.233 --> 01:04:39.668
Well, which? Don't you know?

01:04:42.505 --> 01:04:46.274
You want something to
stop it, is that it?

01:04:46.276 --> 01:04:50.579
No. You see,
it's already stopped.

01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:53.482
Oh, well, we...

01:04:55.585 --> 01:04:58.920
You're not married, are you?

01:04:58.922 --> 01:05:00.222
No.

01:05:02.525 --> 01:05:06.127
Well, I don't have anything
in my store for you...

01:05:06.129 --> 01:05:09.931
and I'd advise you to go home and
tell your Pa, if you have one...

01:05:09.933 --> 01:05:14.903
and let him make somebody
buy you a wedding license.

01:05:14.905 --> 01:05:17.506
But I got the money to pay you.

01:05:17.508 --> 01:05:19.908
A thousand dollars wouldn't
be enough in my store.

01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:23.545
Ten cents wouldn't be enough.

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:31.820
Howdy.

01:05:31.822 --> 01:05:34.756
Can I have a bag of cement?

01:05:36.359 --> 01:05:38.994
That'll be 50 cents.

01:05:38.996 --> 01:05:40.996
50 cents?

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.102
Could I have 10 cents worth?

01:05:47.104 --> 01:05:49.871
10 cents...?
For what?

01:05:52.174 --> 01:05:54.576
My brother broke his leg.

01:05:54.578 --> 01:05:55.744
- What?

01:05:55.746 --> 01:05:58.179
- You gotta get this
wagon outta here.

01:05:58.181 --> 01:06:02.450
It's a public street! I reckon we can stop
to buy something same as any other man.

01:06:02.452 --> 01:06:06.488
We got the money to pay for
it, and there ain't any law...

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:08.890
I just want 10 cents worth.

01:06:08.892 --> 01:06:11.226
I don't wanna break a sack.

01:06:11.228 --> 01:06:15.230
Don't you know you'll cause
that boy to lose his leg?

01:06:15.232 --> 01:06:19.067
You take him to the doctor.

01:06:21.871 --> 01:06:26.441
I would like 10 cents
worth of cement.

01:06:26.443 --> 01:06:27.909
Fine.

01:06:29.512 --> 01:06:32.681
Just get that boy to a doctor.

01:06:32.683 --> 01:06:35.083
You get this thing buried
as soon as you can.

01:06:35.085 --> 01:06:38.520
Don't you know you're tempting jail
for Endangering the public health?

01:06:38.522 --> 01:06:40.622
We're doing the best we can.

01:06:40.624 --> 01:06:44.593
We woulda set out to bury her today, but had
to wait for that boy to bring the wagon back.

01:06:44.595 --> 01:06:46.161
Shut up, Pa!

01:06:46.163 --> 01:06:48.363
Sir, I'm sorry.
We'll be gone in a minute.

01:06:48.365 --> 01:06:49.764
Get this man to a doctor.

01:06:49.766 --> 01:06:52.901
Ain't got to worry about me.
I'm fine.

01:06:52.903 --> 01:06:56.671
Hurry up, Dewey Dell!
We done lost too much time.

01:06:56.673 --> 01:07:01.242
We ain't gonna
discommode you no more.

01:07:01.244 --> 01:07:03.211
Pepper!

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:10.151
(indistinct)

01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:57.232
Here a place.

01:07:59.568 --> 01:08:03.672
Right here. Hold, mule.
Hold, mule.

01:08:04.573 --> 01:08:07.442
We could get some
water over yonder.

01:08:07.444 --> 01:08:11.746
Dewey Dell, you better go see
you can borrow a bucket.

01:08:11.748 --> 01:08:17.752
Guess you had less luck than you
expected selling them cakes in Mottson.

01:08:25.094 --> 01:08:29.131
We better not try and lift him down.
We fix it here.

01:08:30.133 --> 01:08:33.468
When we get to
Jefferson, tomorrow?

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:35.870
I could just last it out.

01:08:35.872 --> 01:08:38.473
It'll be easier this way on you.

01:08:38.475 --> 01:08:40.241
It won't rub together.

01:08:40.243 --> 01:08:42.042
But I can last it out.

01:08:42.045 --> 01:08:45.345
And we'll lose time
if we stop now.

01:08:45.348 --> 01:08:48.450
We done bought the cement now.

01:08:48.452 --> 01:08:52.252
Listen, I can last it out.

01:08:52.255 --> 01:08:54.656
It's just one more day.

01:08:54.658 --> 01:08:58.526
And it don't bother none.
It sets up so.

01:08:58.528 --> 01:09:01.261
We done bought it now.

01:09:09.305 --> 01:09:11.706
How's that look?

01:09:11.707 --> 01:09:15.542
You don't wanna put too
much water in it...

01:09:15.545 --> 01:09:17.444
or it won't work right.

01:09:17.447 --> 01:09:18.979
How's that?

01:09:20.381 --> 01:09:23.718
You know, maybe if you...
y'all could find some sand.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.323
Vardaman, go on and
get some sand.

01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:35.662
I can last it out...

01:09:35.665 --> 01:09:38.800
if it's just one
more day, you know?

01:09:38.801 --> 01:09:42.203
'Cause it don't bother none.

01:09:48.844 --> 01:09:50.345
All right.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.582
Careful with that there.

01:09:54.584 --> 01:09:57.018
Bring your leg out.

01:10:01.023 --> 01:10:05.126
Just mind it so it don't get on

01:10:05.528 --> 01:10:07.929
How's that feel?

01:10:07.931 --> 01:10:09.831
It feels fine.

01:10:09.833 --> 01:10:14.770
It feels cold and good on there.
It feels fine.

01:10:15.572 --> 01:10:18.940
If it'll only help...

01:10:19.475 --> 01:10:21.776
I ask your forgiveness.

01:10:21.778 --> 01:10:26.447
I couldn't have foreseen
it more than you.

01:10:26.849 --> 01:10:29.551
I feel fine.

01:10:35.658 --> 01:10:37.158
All right?

01:10:37.593 --> 01:10:40.295
I think it's gonna rain.

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:04.219
Look, there's Jewel!

01:11:32.281 --> 01:11:34.983
Where that horse?

01:11:37.086 --> 01:11:41.155
Delivered him to Snopes himself.

01:11:42.291 --> 01:11:44.292
You did right.

01:11:55.938 --> 01:11:59.040
This here sure got me tired.

01:11:59.042 --> 01:12:03.378
Darl, if Snopes didn't feed
them mules on sawdust...

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:07.583
would they be able to make the hill
without us have to get out and walk?

01:12:08.585 --> 01:12:10.585
Maybe.

01:12:16.492 --> 01:12:23.399
Dewey Dell, when we stop at night in
the barn, where do them buzzards stay?

01:12:26.001 --> 01:12:30.605
I asked Darl. He
doesn't know neither.

01:12:33.943 --> 01:12:38.647
Tonight I'm gonna see where them
buzzards stay while we're in the barn.

01:12:41.784 --> 01:12:44.786
Where you going?
Hate to discommode you.

01:12:44.788 --> 01:12:47.021
Well, no, sirs,
ain't no trouble.

01:12:47.023 --> 01:12:50.825
But we wonder about
that leg, though.

01:12:50.827 --> 01:12:53.728
How's that feeling, son?

01:12:53.730 --> 01:13:00.169
It's getting a little bit hot from
being in the sun like that all day.

01:13:03.772 --> 01:13:07.977
You want some water poured on it?
Maybe that'll ease it some.

01:13:08.979 --> 01:13:12.046
I'd be obliged.

01:13:12.048 --> 01:13:15.149
It's just from being
in the sun all day.

01:13:15.151 --> 01:13:19.754
I ought to kept my mind
on it to kept it covered.

01:13:30.499 --> 01:13:32.567
How's that feel?

01:13:35.371 --> 01:13:39.474
I'm obliged. That feels fine.

01:13:40.576 --> 01:13:44.012
Well, you folks...

01:13:44.014 --> 01:13:48.282
you have a good night. We'll be right
inside if you need anything else.

01:13:48.284 --> 01:13:49.317
Fine.

01:13:49.319 --> 01:13:53.121
Cash, see if you can
get some sleep.

01:13:53.123 --> 01:13:57.225
Sure. Yeah, it feels fine.

01:14:06.435 --> 01:14:07.635
I miss Ma.

01:14:07.637 --> 01:14:09.637
Come here.

01:14:15.711 --> 01:14:18.846
Put your head right down there.

01:14:18.848 --> 01:14:20.815
Listen.

01:14:23.852 --> 01:14:26.087
Can you hear?

01:14:30.292 --> 01:14:30.825
Yeah?

01:14:30.827 --> 01:14:32.060
I can hear her.

01:14:32.062 --> 01:14:33.327
You hear?

01:14:33.329 --> 01:14:39.134
What's she saying, Darl?
Who's she talking to?

01:14:39.836 --> 01:14:42.236
Talking to God.

01:14:42.238 --> 01:14:45.373
She's calling on
Him to help her.

01:14:45.375 --> 01:14:48.276
What she wanting to do?

01:14:50.412 --> 01:14:54.182
She wants Him to hide her
from the sight of man.

01:14:54.184 --> 01:14:58.319
Why does she want to
get hid away, Darl?

01:14:59.254 --> 01:15:01.689
So she can lay down her life.

01:15:01.691 --> 01:15:05.760
Why does she wanna
lay down her life?

01:15:09.498 --> 01:15:11.432
Just listen.

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:17.171
Listen.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.574
You can hear?

01:15:21.877 --> 01:15:24.579
She's been calling out.

01:15:25.481 --> 01:15:30.284
Ever since the river,
she's been calling out.

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:55.042
What are they doing, Dewey Dell?

01:15:55.044 --> 01:15:57.445
They're bringing Ma on the barn.

01:15:57.447 --> 01:16:01.249
They don't wanna leave
her outdoors all night.

01:16:01.251 --> 01:16:04.585
I can smell her.
Can you smell her, too?

01:16:04.587 --> 01:16:06.587
Hush.

01:16:37.085 --> 01:16:41.589
I went looking to find where
them buzzards stay at night.

01:16:41.591 --> 01:16:45.393
I saw something Dewey Dell
told me not tell nobody.

01:16:45.395 --> 01:16:49.030
It's not about Pa and
it's not about Cash...

01:16:49.032 --> 01:16:52.300
and it's not about Jewel and
it's not about Dewey Dell...

01:16:52.302 --> 01:16:55.703
and it's not about me.

01:16:56.838 --> 01:17:00.208
Help! Fire! There's a fire!

01:17:00.609 --> 01:17:02.610
Pa! Pa!

01:17:36.878 --> 01:17:39.280
Let's get the mules!

01:17:39.282 --> 01:17:43.117
Get the mules! Get the mules!

01:17:43.119 --> 01:17:45.319
Come on.

01:17:48.156 --> 01:17:50.358
Look out!

01:18:00.302 --> 01:18:02.970
Jewel! Jewel!

01:18:09.845 --> 01:18:13.014
Jewel! Jewel!

01:18:19.154 --> 01:18:22.056
Stop him! Jewel!

01:18:22.058 --> 01:18:24.759
Stop him!

01:20:07.963 --> 01:20:09.964
Where Darl?

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.969
Where Darl got to?

01:20:17.773 --> 01:20:20.741
Your foot look funny, Cash.

01:20:22.344 --> 01:20:26.514
I reckon we gonna have
to bust that off.

01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:41.829
You take that off, gonna
take the hide, too.

01:20:41.831 --> 01:20:44.465
Why in tarnation did
you put it on there?

01:20:44.467 --> 01:20:46.867
I thought it might
steady it some.

01:20:46.869 --> 01:20:50.171
Didn't anybody think to
grease his leg first?

01:20:50.173 --> 01:20:53.374
I only aimed to help him.

01:20:53.376 --> 01:20:56.043
It was Darl put it on.

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:00.548
Where is Darl?

01:21:01.450 --> 01:21:03.684
Where is Darl?

01:21:22.003 --> 01:21:22.703
Oh, God.

01:21:22.705 --> 01:21:25.840
Be it best to leave it on.

01:21:30.545 --> 01:21:34.014
You gonna keep the
cat away, Darl?

01:21:39.254 --> 01:21:44.859
You needn't to cry. Jewel got her out.
You needn't to cry, Darl.

01:21:45.661 --> 01:21:50.664
If you could just travel out
into time, that would be nice.

01:21:50.666 --> 01:21:55.470
It'd be nice if you could
just travel out into time.

01:21:57.372 --> 01:22:03.378
Takes two people to make you.
And one people to die.

01:22:05.313 --> 01:22:07.748
It's how the world will end.

01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:10.618
Can you still hear her?

01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:25.466
Hey, Darl, we close
to Jefferson?

01:22:25.468 --> 01:22:27.668
Yeah.

01:22:28.570 --> 01:22:31.705
Life was created in the valleys.

01:22:31.707 --> 01:22:34.008
It was blew up on the hills
on the old terrors...

01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:36.510
the old lusts and
the old despair.

01:22:36.512 --> 01:22:41.216
That's why you must walk up the
hills, so you can ride down.

01:22:42.118 --> 01:22:43.317
I gotta stop.

01:22:43.319 --> 01:22:45.219
What for?

01:22:45.221 --> 01:22:46.720
I gotta go to the bushes.

01:22:46.722 --> 01:22:49.323
Can't you wait till
we get to town?

01:22:49.325 --> 01:22:52.059
Stop! I gotta go to the bushes!

01:22:53.662 --> 01:22:55.863
Hold, mule!

01:23:01.803 --> 01:23:06.441
Leave them cakes.
We'll look after them.

01:23:08.043 --> 01:23:11.345
We gonna have to take
him to the doctor.

01:23:11.347 --> 01:23:14.748
I reckon we just have to.

01:23:16.151 --> 01:23:19.486
We ought to send word
from Gillespie's...

01:23:19.488 --> 01:23:22.389
have someone get
that grave ready.

01:23:22.391 --> 01:23:26.927
I just never wanna be beholden
to none but her flesh and blood.

01:23:26.929 --> 01:23:30.030
Who can't dig a damn
hole in the ground?

01:23:30.032 --> 01:23:34.569
It ain't respectful talking
that way about your Ma's grave!

01:23:35.771 --> 01:23:40.074
You just don't know what it is.

01:23:40.076 --> 01:23:44.211
You never pure loved
her, none of you.

01:23:47.716 --> 01:23:52.721
I thought I told you to
leave them clothes to home.

01:24:01.529 --> 01:24:04.932
Pepper! Come on, mule.

01:24:07.035 --> 01:24:09.136
How many more hills now, Darl?

01:24:09.138 --> 01:24:10.838
Just one.

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:14.875
Next one goes all
the way into town.

01:24:52.347 --> 01:24:53.881
Hold, mule!

01:24:57.185 --> 01:25:00.788
I reckon we gotta
slide it in yonder.

01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:04.124
They got...

01:25:04.126 --> 01:25:08.630
one or two Christians
inside, I'm betting.

01:25:09.632 --> 01:25:12.866
What we need is some shovels.
We can go to a hardware store.

01:25:12.868 --> 01:25:14.768
That costs money!

01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:17.738
You begrudge her it?

01:28:01.336 --> 01:28:05.639
Skeet, there's a woman up front
that wants to see the doctor.

01:28:05.641 --> 01:28:09.276
I said, "What doctor do you want to see?",
she said, the doctor that works here.

01:28:09.278 --> 01:28:13.714
When I told her there ain't any doctor works
here, she just stood there, looking this way.

01:28:13.716 --> 01:28:17.718
What kind of woman is it?
Tell her to go upstairs to Alford's office.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.620
Country woman.

01:28:19.622 --> 01:28:21.421
Send her to the courthouse.

01:28:21.423 --> 01:28:24.625
Tell her all the doctors have gone
to Memphis to a barbers' convention.

01:28:24.627 --> 01:28:28.495
All right. She's just pretty
nice for a country girl.

01:28:28.497 --> 01:28:31.198
Wait. Wait.

01:28:45.713 --> 01:28:47.648
What can I do for you?

01:28:47.650 --> 01:28:49.549
Are you the doctor?

01:28:49.551 --> 01:28:51.018
Sure.

01:28:51.953 --> 01:28:55.355
Can we go back yonder?

01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:01.495
Now...

01:29:01.497 --> 01:29:03.897
madam...

01:29:03.899 --> 01:29:05.832
what is your trouble?

01:29:05.834 --> 01:29:10.137
It's a female trouble.
I got the money.

01:29:10.139 --> 01:29:12.506
Have you got female
trouble is all?

01:29:12.508 --> 01:29:16.510
Or you want female trouble?
If this so, you've come to the right doctor.

01:29:16.512 --> 01:29:18.412
- No.

01:29:18.414 --> 01:29:20.113
No which?

01:29:20.115 --> 01:29:23.550
I ain't had it. That's it.

01:29:23.952 --> 01:29:26.453
I got the money.

01:29:29.290 --> 01:29:35.096
You got something in your belly
you wished you didn't have.

01:29:39.701 --> 01:29:44.005
'Course you realize I could be put in the
Penitentiary after doing what you want?

01:29:44.907 --> 01:29:47.307
I would lose my license.

01:29:47.309 --> 01:29:49.910
Then I'd have to go to work.

01:29:49.912 --> 01:29:52.179
You realize that.

01:29:53.781 --> 01:29:55.482
I ain't got but $10...

01:29:55.484 --> 01:29:59.486
but I could bring the
rest next month, maybe.

01:29:59.488 --> 01:30:01.688
Ten dollars.

01:30:01.690 --> 01:30:05.492
You see, I can't put no price
on my knowledge and skill.

01:30:05.494 --> 01:30:08.095
Certainly not for a
little poultry sawbuck.

01:30:08.097 --> 01:30:11.064
What do you want then?

01:30:13.167 --> 01:30:17.771
You guess three times,
then I'll show you.

01:30:22.043 --> 01:30:25.479
I got to do something.

01:30:38.326 --> 01:30:42.430
You come back 10 o'clock tonight,
I give you the rest of it.

01:30:43.532 --> 01:30:45.232
Will it work?

01:30:45.234 --> 01:30:49.369
Sure it'll work. If you
come back and get it.

01:31:11.926 --> 01:31:15.195
Get on up outta there.

01:31:44.459 --> 01:31:46.460
Fill it in.

01:31:50.665 --> 01:31:52.165
Go on.

01:32:11.819 --> 01:32:13.753
Darl Bundren?

01:32:21.095 --> 01:32:22.863
Yeah.

01:32:22.865 --> 01:32:26.600
How does Gillespie know
it was Darl that done it?

01:32:26.602 --> 01:32:30.671
Vardaman swore he never
told nobody but me.

01:32:35.476 --> 01:32:39.513
If Vardaman never told nobody
but you, how come they know it?

01:32:39.515 --> 01:32:41.915
It don't matter.

01:32:41.917 --> 01:32:44.985
What matters is Gillespie knows.

01:32:44.987 --> 01:32:47.387
He'd suspicioned it
sooner or later.

01:32:47.389 --> 01:32:50.524
I reckon it ain't
no way around it.

01:32:50.526 --> 01:32:54.327
We got to send him to Jackson.

01:32:54.329 --> 01:32:57.430
It's either that or
Gillespie sue us.

01:32:57.432 --> 01:33:00.033
So you wanna fix him now?

01:33:00.035 --> 01:33:01.234
Fix him?

01:33:01.236 --> 01:33:02.969
Yeah, catch him. Tie him up.

01:33:02.971 --> 01:33:06.975
Or you wanna wait till he sets fire
to the goddamn team and wagon?

01:33:08.177 --> 01:33:10.377
He's crazy!

01:33:14.348 --> 01:33:18.386
That's 'cause Jewel
was too hard on him.

01:33:19.388 --> 01:33:21.788
I thought about it
more than once...

01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:25.091
before we crossed the
river and after...

01:33:25.093 --> 01:33:27.494
that it would be
God's blessing...

01:33:27.496 --> 01:33:30.096
if He'd taken her
out of our hands...

01:33:30.098 --> 01:33:33.700
and we got shut of her
in some clean way.

01:33:33.702 --> 01:33:38.705
It seemed to me, when Jewel was working
to get her out in the river...

01:33:38.707 --> 01:33:43.043
he was going against
God in a way.

01:33:43.045 --> 01:33:47.715
And when Darl seen that it looked like one
of us was gonna have to do something...

01:33:48.717 --> 01:33:53.754
well, I can almost believe that
he done right, in a way.

01:33:54.456 --> 01:33:58.258
But that don't excuse burning
down a man's barn...

01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:04.298
or endangering his stock, or
destroying his property.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.802
I guess there ain't no
excuse for what Darl did...

01:34:08.804 --> 01:34:13.641
endangering that stock,
destroying his property.

01:34:14.443 --> 01:34:18.778
I reckon that's how
a man's crazy.

01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:23.783
He can't see eye to
eye with other folks.

01:34:23.785 --> 01:34:26.886
And I suppose there ain't
much you can do...

01:34:26.888 --> 01:34:31.292
except for what it is that
most folks says is right.

01:34:33.995 --> 01:34:37.897
But it's a shame in a way.

01:34:44.038 --> 01:34:46.740
Are you Darl Bundren?

01:34:49.076 --> 01:34:51.745
You better come with us.

01:34:52.847 --> 01:34:55.548
Get off me! Cash!

01:34:56.684 --> 01:34:58.385
- Cash!

01:34:58.387 --> 01:34:59.786
- You son of a bitch!

01:34:59.788 --> 01:35:01.488
- Cash!

01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:04.157
- All right.
Dewey, let go of him!

01:35:04.159 --> 01:35:06.593
Cash, I thought you
woulda told me.

01:35:06.595 --> 01:35:10.630
I never thought you
wouldn't have told me.

01:35:10.632 --> 01:35:11.931
Cash?

01:35:14.702 --> 01:35:18.071
All right, all right, all right.

01:35:25.379 --> 01:35:28.815
You can scratch at
me all you want.

01:35:31.619 --> 01:35:35.422
Maybe, you see, if I'm gone...

01:35:35.424 --> 01:35:37.657
no one'll know.

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:44.264
Ain't gonna go away, just like
whatever you got in that box

01:35:44.266 --> 01:35:47.000
ain't gonna make it go away.

01:35:48.836 --> 01:35:51.571
And you...

01:35:51.573 --> 01:35:58.347
What, you think the questions are just gonna
go away just 'cause I ain't here to ask them?

01:36:00.781 --> 01:36:02.816
Darl...

01:36:03.250 --> 01:36:05.885
Is this what you want?

01:36:07.021 --> 01:36:09.923
Maybe it'll be better for you.

01:36:09.925 --> 01:36:13.159
It's quiet down there
without all the bothering.

01:36:13.161 --> 01:36:15.562
Is that what you think I am?

01:36:15.564 --> 01:36:17.964
It'll be better for you, Darl.

01:36:17.966 --> 01:36:19.666
Better? Better?

01:36:19.668 --> 01:36:22.268
It's quiet down there, yeah.

01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:25.372
Is that what you think I am?

01:36:25.374 --> 01:36:28.441
It'll be better for you.

01:36:28.443 --> 01:36:30.276
Maybe it'll be better.

01:36:30.278 --> 01:36:32.979
Maybe. Maybe!

01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:55.101
Vardaman, come here.

01:37:54.528 --> 01:37:58.364
It was getting right
noticeable...

01:37:58.366 --> 01:38:01.501
the smell, that is.

01:38:01.503 --> 01:38:05.605
We didn't have no time to waste.

01:38:07.241 --> 01:38:10.310
It don't bother none.

01:38:10.312 --> 01:38:12.679
Don't you lie there
and tell me that.

01:38:12.681 --> 01:38:15.081
You with all that
time on a wagon...

01:38:15.083 --> 01:38:20.721
with no springs and a broken
leg, and it don't bother you.

01:38:21.523 --> 01:38:23.723
Well...

01:38:25.359 --> 01:38:27.760
It don't bother much.

01:38:27.762 --> 01:38:31.799
You mean, it don't
bother Anse much.

01:38:32.801 --> 01:38:35.935
Why don't he just take you
over to the nearest sawmill...

01:38:35.937 --> 01:38:40.440
and put your leg in a saw?
That woulda cured it.

01:38:40.442 --> 01:38:42.642
And you all coulda taken...

01:38:42.644 --> 01:38:48.749
Anse over to the saw, stuck his head
in there and cured the whole family.

01:38:50.451 --> 01:38:54.554
Son, this toe is gangrenous.

01:39:24.018 --> 01:39:28.121
Get it off, Doc!
Take it! Go! Go!

01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:54.480
You wait out here.

01:39:54.482 --> 01:39:55.682
Why can't I come in?

01:39:55.684 --> 01:39:57.584
I wanna come in, too.

01:39:57.586 --> 01:39:58.918
You wait out here.

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:00.920
All right.

01:40:21.575 --> 01:40:24.177
You want something?

01:40:24.179 --> 01:40:26.212
A banana.

01:40:31.118 --> 01:40:33.820
Where is it?

01:40:38.592 --> 01:40:39.792
There it is.

01:40:39.794 --> 01:40:42.195
And you're sure it'll work?

01:40:42.197 --> 01:40:47.201
Sure. As long as you take
the rest of the treatment.

01:40:49.303 --> 01:40:51.337
Where do I take it?

01:40:54.308 --> 01:40:56.309
Let me show you.

01:41:05.586 --> 01:41:07.987
That's what you want.

01:41:07.989 --> 01:41:10.590
That's what you came back for?

01:41:10.592 --> 01:41:13.960
That's what you came back for.

01:41:15.362 --> 01:41:19.966
Take that little seed out.
Take the little acorn that you got in.

01:41:19.968 --> 01:41:24.037
Yeah, that's what
you came back for.

01:41:26.874 --> 01:41:29.042
I'm gonna fix you.

01:41:32.746 --> 01:41:37.050
My brother, they
say he went crazy.

01:41:37.052 --> 01:41:40.186
But he went to Jackson, too.

01:41:40.188 --> 01:41:45.191
Jackson is further
away than crazy.

01:41:45.193 --> 01:41:49.196
He had to get on a train
to go to Jackson.

01:41:50.398 --> 01:41:54.033
I've not been on a train.

01:41:54.035 --> 01:41:57.437
But Darl has been on a train.

01:41:58.105 --> 01:42:00.440
Darl.

01:42:00.442 --> 01:42:03.142
Darl is my brother.

01:42:16.690 --> 01:42:19.392
Why do I laugh?

01:42:20.494 --> 01:42:23.629
Why do you laugh, Darl?

01:42:23.631 --> 01:42:26.699
Is it because you hate
the sound of laughter?

01:42:26.701 --> 01:42:29.802
Is that why you laughing, Darl?

01:42:29.804 --> 01:42:33.139
Is it because your
mother is a fish?

01:42:33.141 --> 01:42:34.807
A horse?

01:42:34.809 --> 01:42:37.744
Is it because you no
longer have a mother?

01:42:37.746 --> 01:42:43.117
Because you hear the dark lands speaking
of God and His beauty and His sin?

01:42:44.119 --> 01:42:46.519
Because we use each
other with words...

01:42:46.521 --> 01:42:51.424
<i>like spiders hanging by their
mouths from the rafters...</i>

01:42:51.426 --> 01:42:55.895
<i>swinging and twisting
and never touching.</i>

01:44:04.965 --> 01:44:07.166
He got them teeth.

01:44:20.681 --> 01:44:21.948
Who's that?

01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:25.051
That there is Cash.

01:44:25.053 --> 01:44:27.453
That there is Jewel.

01:44:27.455 --> 01:44:31.591
That Vardaman,
and that's Dewey Dell.

01:44:33.393 --> 01:44:36.095
Meet Mrs. Bundren.

01:45:27.281 --> 01:45:29.282
Pepper.

01:45:32.085 --> 01:45:34.987
It's gonna be a little.
