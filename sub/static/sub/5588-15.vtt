WEBVTT

00:01.033 --> 00:02.368
Huh.

00:05.420 --> 00:07.388
My super-awesome family

00:07.422 --> 00:10.190
was throwing me
a surprise early birthday party.

00:10.192 --> 00:12.076
I'm guess
I'm the only one at home.

00:12.127 --> 00:13.260
- How could you do this?!
- Dad!

00:13.294 --> 00:14.428
You were supposed
to be my hero!

00:14.462 --> 00:15.629
You let me down!

00:15.663 --> 00:18.399
Or I forgot
to meet the electrician today

00:18.433 --> 00:20.567
to fix our faulty junction box.

00:21.570 --> 00:23.303
Guys, I'm not gonna
make excuses.

00:23.338 --> 00:24.772
I've been really busy at work.

00:24.806 --> 00:26.607
Well, I was halfway through
straightening my hair.

00:26.609 --> 00:27.609
And I was in the middle

00:27.675 --> 00:28.926
of doing three weeks' worth
of laundry.

00:29.306 --> 00:31.207
And I was actually
writing a term paper

00:31.241 --> 00:33.709
right when the lights went out,
and... what?

00:33.794 --> 00:34.844
This isn't soda.

00:34.878 --> 00:36.212
Okay, before you guys
say anything,

00:36.263 --> 00:38.131
I only put this on because
I didn't have anything --

00:40.467 --> 00:41.467
Aah!

00:41.518 --> 00:43.853
Well, the problem
obviously self-corrected,

00:43.887 --> 00:45.304
which I knew it would.

00:45.355 --> 00:46.639
Well, I fixed it.

00:46.690 --> 00:47.940
Yeah, mom called a guy.

00:47.975 --> 00:50.776
Oh, Claire, I'm so sorry.
I got busy at work, and --

00:50.811 --> 00:52.311
Oh, honey,
don't even worry about it.

00:52.313 --> 00:54.614
Mwah. I'm just glad
the fridge is up and running.

00:54.648 --> 00:56.816
I pre-packed
all the lunches for tomorrow.

00:56.867 --> 00:59.619
I didn't want the Brie
on the sandwiches to get runny.

00:59.653 --> 01:00.453
Brie?

01:00.487 --> 01:01.454
Don't tell me any more.

01:01.488 --> 01:02.655
I live for the surprise.

01:02.657 --> 01:04.790
Hey, Mom, I know you're
really busy at work, but --

01:04.825 --> 01:07.159
Sweetheart, I would never
use that as an excuse.

01:07.161 --> 01:08.210
What do you need?

01:08.245 --> 01:09.545
- The cupcakes for the bake sale.
- Okay.

01:09.579 --> 01:10.913
Oh, and since we got stuck here,

01:10.964 --> 01:11.998
I couldn't go out and get

01:12.049 --> 01:13.049
that birthday present
for my roommate.

01:13.083 --> 01:14.383
Or my dress
from the dry cleaners.

01:14.418 --> 01:16.335
Done, done, and done.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.221
- We have the best mom ever.
- Hugs!

01:19.256 --> 01:20.506
Okay. Aww.

01:20.508 --> 01:22.508
- Wait, wait, guys. Guys, Dad's here.
- Oh.

01:22.510 --> 01:25.144
Dad, take a photo of us hugging Mom.

01:25.178 --> 01:26.712
Until now, when I'd
screw up on the home front,

01:26.746 --> 01:28.380
I could always blame work,

01:28.415 --> 01:29.648
but with Claire
running a company

01:29.683 --> 01:30.916
and being a better mom
than ever,

01:30.951 --> 01:32.251
I could feel
the kids downgrading

01:32.285 --> 01:33.445
their whole opinion of me.

01:33.487 --> 01:35.955
I went from an "A" dad
to an "F" dad.

01:35.989 --> 01:40.526
Fail Dunphy.
Phil Dun-fail.

01:40.560 --> 01:45.030
Failip Hum-fail Dun--
No, I had it before.

01:45.032 --> 01:45.865
Say "Brie."

01:45.916 --> 01:47.032
Brie!

01:47.083 --> 01:48.367
Hey, you know what?

01:48.418 --> 01:50.619
I could do
some of that kid stuff tomorrow.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.538
You've got that open house.

01:52.540 --> 01:55.290
Honey, I've been juggling
work and family for 22 years

01:55.342 --> 01:56.842
and just juggling for 30.

01:56.876 --> 01:58.711
Well, I really need that dress
for an event, so --

01:58.762 --> 01:59.712
I got it.

01:59.714 --> 02:01.880
Agenda for tomorrow --
One dress,

02:01.882 --> 02:05.718
one set of cupcakes,
one present, and that's it.

02:05.769 --> 02:07.519
I got ya!
You thought I forgot.

02:07.554 --> 02:11.056
I will be here to meet the alarm
company at precisely 3:40...

02:13.059 --> 02:15.060
...earlier today.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.671
You didn't make enough
noise last night?

02:32.173 --> 02:34.473
With all his crying,
I didn't sleep four hours.

02:34.508 --> 02:35.508
I didn't close my eyes.

02:35.510 --> 02:37.176
It was like
being back in my village,

02:37.178 --> 02:38.561
watching for the marauders.

02:38.595 --> 02:39.845
I don't know
what's more shocking --

02:39.847 --> 02:41.681
you standing watch,
or knowing the word "marauders."

02:41.683 --> 02:43.516
Please tell me
I didn't sob all night

02:43.567 --> 02:45.317
just 'cause I lost
my baby blanket.

02:45.352 --> 02:47.320
Shh! Don't remind him.
He's happy now.

02:47.354 --> 02:49.355
And besides,
you didn't even have a blanket.

02:49.357 --> 02:50.990
We were basically destitute.

02:51.024 --> 02:52.324
What, did you get hit
by lightning?

02:52.359 --> 02:54.360
Thank God that
Joe has a playdate.

02:54.362 --> 02:55.661
Vicky's picking us up.

02:55.695 --> 02:57.663
I'm gonna make him play so hard

02:57.697 --> 02:59.698
that he's gonna pass out
tonight.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.367
Well, I've got a playdate
with Johnnie Walker,

03:01.418 --> 03:03.285
so one of us
is passing out tonight.

03:04.504 --> 03:06.038
Yeah, I know
we're out of dog food.

03:06.089 --> 03:07.440
I'll pick some up after golf.

03:07.474 --> 03:09.375
She could lose
a couple of pounds, anyways.

03:09.426 --> 03:10.626
Thank God
you don't have a daughter.

03:12.379 --> 03:14.630
The minute
that kid falls asleep,

03:14.681 --> 03:16.966
that plane goes Amelia Earhart.

03:18.385 --> 03:20.553
Doesn't this seem
a little chintzy?

03:20.555 --> 03:21.720
Yeah, can we go now?

03:21.722 --> 03:23.722
No, we haven't said hello
to the grooms --

03:23.724 --> 03:26.392
or the talented people
who planned this wedding.

03:26.443 --> 03:28.561
Another great Pepper Saltzman
production, guys.

03:28.611 --> 03:32.364
Oh, please. What's tackier
than a Friday lunch wedding?

03:32.399 --> 03:35.618
Table five needs more...
ketchup.

03:35.652 --> 03:37.236
I have to hide my face
with a coat

03:37.238 --> 03:39.071
every time the videographer
comes around.

03:39.122 --> 03:40.205
In the old days,

03:40.240 --> 03:41.907
he'd never taken
a cheap job like this,

03:41.909 --> 03:44.209
but the gay-wedding business
is drying up.

03:44.244 --> 03:47.963
We do the bargain ones
as Sherman Saltzman Events,

03:47.997 --> 03:49.581
and I haven't been Sherman

03:49.632 --> 03:52.251
since I got on that bus
in Lubbock 35 years ago.

03:52.302 --> 03:54.503
We've only booked two others
in months --

03:54.554 --> 03:55.921
Adam and Michael last weekend

03:55.972 --> 03:58.340
and Felix and Jordan
next Monday.

03:58.391 --> 04:00.225
Ugh. Monday.

04:00.260 --> 04:01.844
Oh, away, you vulture.

04:03.096 --> 04:04.346
Cam, do you think
it's a little weird --

04:04.397 --> 04:06.181
That we weren't invited
to Adam and Michael's

04:06.232 --> 04:07.933
or Felix and Jordan's?
Yes. Totally weird.

04:07.984 --> 04:09.518
Okay, sweetie,
here's the kids table.

04:09.569 --> 04:11.937
Where is our table?
There are no more tables.

04:11.988 --> 04:13.906
Oh, my God.

04:13.940 --> 04:15.941
That's us.
Number 65.

04:15.943 --> 04:17.276
Where are our friends?

04:17.327 --> 04:18.744
Not here.

04:18.778 --> 04:20.612
Are we on some sort
of gay blacklist?

04:22.532 --> 04:24.783
I'm not sitting there.
You're sitting there.

04:26.252 --> 04:27.202
Hello.

04:27.253 --> 04:28.120
Hey, honey.

04:28.122 --> 04:30.122
Oh, cupcakes, present, dress.

04:30.173 --> 04:31.540
I remember.
I'm gonna get on that

04:31.591 --> 04:33.125
just as soon as I'm done
with my open house.

04:33.127 --> 04:35.293
I just wanted to clarify,
where am I getting the present?

04:35.295 --> 04:36.378
Uh, hang on, Phil.

04:36.429 --> 04:38.263
I'm in the middle of something.

04:38.265 --> 04:40.832
Um, uh, just one second.

04:40.867 --> 04:44.136
I'm -- it's at the Best Buy.
Ask for S-Sean -- Stan.

04:44.469 --> 04:45.302
It's under "Dunphy."

04:45.336 --> 04:46.336
Thanks, honey.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.437
I don't know how you do it all.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.122
Love you.

04:49.157 --> 04:50.791
That's a "T"?

04:50.793 --> 04:53.293
They say it takes a village
to raise a family

04:53.327 --> 04:54.828
and run a company.

04:54.830 --> 04:56.096
Turns out, it just takes

04:56.130 --> 04:58.398
one little suck-up
from marketing named Ben.

04:58.449 --> 05:00.233
Oh, Claire,
I don't know if you heard.

05:00.235 --> 05:02.169
They moved the Kramer meeting
back to 5:00.

05:02.220 --> 05:03.053
- No.
- Yeah.

05:03.087 --> 05:04.171
No, I-I have
to make a lasagna

05:04.205 --> 05:05.322
for Luke's team dinner,

05:05.356 --> 05:07.140
- but I can't miss that meeting.
- Oh.

05:07.190 --> 05:08.307
You know,
I know my way around a kitchen.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.491
My mom's an alcoholic.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.593
So I could easily knock out
a lasagna for you.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.012
Ben, you are a lifesaver.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.315
Wow. I promise
I will not make a habit of it.

05:16.349 --> 05:18.350
I kind of made a habit of it.

05:18.798 --> 05:19.632
Calm down.

05:19.634 --> 05:21.016
We only cut two classes,

05:21.051 --> 05:24.319
and I'll send an excuse e-mail
from your mom's computer.

05:24.370 --> 05:25.821
I can't believe
I agreed to ditch with you

05:25.872 --> 05:27.890
just 'cause you gave me
half your Brie sandwich.

05:27.924 --> 05:29.575
Although
that party-crashing apple slice

05:29.609 --> 05:31.310
turned out to be
a welcome plus-one.

05:31.312 --> 05:33.162
So we can make it official now.

05:33.213 --> 05:34.413
I have three gay uncles.

05:36.232 --> 05:37.432
Yeah,
I'm -- I'm sorry, Miles.

05:37.484 --> 05:38.817
No, apologize to the guys.

05:38.852 --> 05:40.892
It's just,
I'm too tired to play golf.

05:42.305 --> 05:43.856
Damn it! The dog food!

05:48.628 --> 05:50.295
Ah.

05:50.297 --> 05:52.447
Stella, this is your lucky day.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.233
Gloria makes this Colombian dish

05:54.250 --> 05:56.210
I loved
when we were first dating.

05:58.196 --> 06:00.298
I lied about a lot of things
back then.

06:04.903 --> 06:06.370
What the hell are you doing?!

06:07.472 --> 06:09.724
That takes me three days!

06:09.758 --> 06:11.576
Three days to prepare!

06:11.610 --> 06:13.327
And then
you say that you love it,

06:13.362 --> 06:14.879
and you feed it to the dog?

06:14.913 --> 06:17.848
What else have you been lying
about, Jay Kennedy Pritchett?

06:20.335 --> 06:22.820
No Daddy kisses till Sunday
after she eats this.

06:23.471 --> 06:24.388
Sorry, Vicky.

06:24.422 --> 06:26.557
We have to cancel the playdate.

06:26.591 --> 06:29.610
Joe fell asleep in the car,
and I don't want to wake him up.

06:29.661 --> 06:30.995
Okay.

06:31.046 --> 06:32.846
Thank God that
Jay was out playing golf.

06:32.881 --> 06:35.115
The last time that I left Joe
sleeping in the car...

06:35.150 --> 06:36.316
Honey, where's Joe?

06:36.318 --> 06:37.534
Sleeping in the car.

06:37.569 --> 06:38.702
Are you crazy?!

06:38.737 --> 06:40.304
You don't leave a kid
in the car!

06:40.338 --> 06:43.056
Why don't you just put a sign on
him saying "free coyote food"?!

06:43.108 --> 06:45.259
I have never seen anyone so mad.

06:45.293 --> 06:47.961
Even the marauders, you could
have a conversation with.

06:48.474 --> 06:50.092
"Family emergency.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.728
Blah, blah, blah.
Gloria Pritchett."

06:52.779 --> 06:53.612
And send.

06:53.646 --> 06:55.614
I hate that I have to ask this,

06:55.648 --> 06:57.532
but you didn't type
"Blah, blah, blah," did you?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.167
You need to chill...

06:59.202 --> 07:00.535
like my girlfriend here.

07:03.456 --> 07:04.873
Nah, I can't enjoy that.

07:04.875 --> 07:06.675
I just keep thinking about
that girl's father.

07:06.709 --> 07:08.593
Could you please just get that
off my mom's computer?

07:08.628 --> 07:11.046
Okay. That was your reward
for ditching,

07:11.048 --> 07:12.514
but if you don't want to...

07:12.548 --> 07:13.932
Uh-oh.

07:13.966 --> 07:14.933
What "uh-oh"?

07:14.967 --> 07:16.852
Uh, it's frozen.

07:16.886 --> 07:17.886
What?!

07:17.888 --> 07:18.887
Oh, my God.

07:18.889 --> 07:19.888
It froze on that?

07:19.890 --> 07:22.391
Hey.
"That" has a name.

07:22.393 --> 07:24.726
Here, Stella.
Come and get it, girl.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.728
Jay, is that you?

07:26.779 --> 07:28.230
Yep.

07:28.232 --> 07:29.448
Damn it.

07:29.482 --> 07:30.398
Damn it.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.120
Damn it!
Damn it!

07:33.140 --> 07:35.174
- I didn't hear you come in.
- That's good.

07:35.251 --> 07:38.020
Uh -- Oh, how come
you're home so early?

07:38.054 --> 07:39.121
Too tired for golf.

07:39.172 --> 07:39.972
Where's Joe?

07:40.006 --> 07:41.139
- Upstairs.
- Ah.

07:41.190 --> 07:43.075
I finally got him to sleep.

07:44.060 --> 07:45.627
She wants to get out.

07:45.654 --> 07:46.988
- I'll take her.
- No, no, no. You stay here.

07:47.022 --> 07:48.756
- I'll do it.
- No, you can't.

07:48.791 --> 07:51.826
I mean, w-we rarely
get times like this anymore.

07:51.860 --> 07:54.996
Joe's sleeping,
Manny is at school.

07:55.031 --> 07:56.181
Why don't we
go upstairs and --

07:56.215 --> 07:56.998
Take a nap.

07:57.049 --> 07:58.817
Exactly!

07:59.115 --> 08:00.415
My mom got picked up
by a friend.

08:00.450 --> 08:01.817
We can take her car
to the computer store

08:01.851 --> 08:03.435
and be back
before she gets home.

08:03.486 --> 08:06.788
Wow. She left the windows down
and the lights on.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.107
Sometimes, she is so oblivious.

08:15.552 --> 08:18.270
All I had to do was wait
for Jay to fall asleep.

08:18.305 --> 08:19.305
Genius.

08:22.059 --> 08:24.927
She'd be snoring in minutes.
Piece of cake.

08:29.522 --> 08:31.856
We are so far away
from everything.

08:31.944 --> 08:34.212
During the last toast,
I saw them clink the glasses

08:34.214 --> 08:35.980
before the sound
actually reached us.

08:36.014 --> 08:36.864
Snubbed at this wedding,

08:36.899 --> 08:38.448
not invited to two others --

08:38.484 --> 08:40.251
What could you
have possibly done?

08:40.302 --> 08:42.986
Um...

08:43.020 --> 08:44.872
Sorry. I said I would switch
with you at dessert.

08:44.907 --> 08:46.390
Oh, Pepper. Pepper.

08:46.425 --> 08:47.425
- Do you have any idea why --
- Oh, sorry.

08:47.476 --> 08:49.594
I'm in a mad rush
to the mashed-potato bar

08:49.628 --> 08:52.630
to restock something
called... fixin's.

08:52.664 --> 08:55.132
If you
ever felt anything for me,

08:55.167 --> 08:57.118
you'll push me out a window.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.101
You know, Mitchell,
m-maybe it's --

09:00.152 --> 09:01.169
Shh! Shh, shh, shh!

09:01.203 --> 09:02.704
Look. I can't
have this fight again.

09:02.706 --> 09:03.571
I saw you ogling him.

09:03.605 --> 09:04.806
Hey, as far as I'm concerned,

09:04.857 --> 09:06.407
we never have
to have this fight again.

09:06.409 --> 09:07.409
Mitchell, stop it.

09:07.459 --> 09:08.459
- Hmm? What? Huh? Hmm?
- Eavesdropping?

09:08.768 --> 09:09.518
Trolling for business?

09:09.552 --> 09:10.602
You've been doing it

09:10.637 --> 09:11.904
ever since you started
handling gay divorce.

09:11.955 --> 09:12.871
It's kind of ghoulish.

09:12.922 --> 09:14.256
- Ghoulish?
- Yes.

09:14.307 --> 09:16.108
I'll bet that's why
nobody wants us around.

09:16.142 --> 09:19.478
That's it. You're like the
Angel of Death of gay marriage.

09:19.512 --> 09:20.746
You're like a cat
at an old-folks' home

09:20.748 --> 09:22.598
who curls up next to somebody
about to die.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.366
They're judging me?

09:24.417 --> 09:26.051
Felix and Jordan sell fur.

09:26.086 --> 09:28.087
Sorry. We couldn't help
overhearing you overhearing us.

09:28.121 --> 09:29.521
Some friends of ours
are breaking up,

09:29.556 --> 09:30.656
and they need
a good divorce lawyer.

09:30.707 --> 09:31.590
- Do you have a card?
- Oh.

09:31.624 --> 09:32.841
We couldn't help overhearing you

09:32.876 --> 09:34.476
talking about you overhearing
you overhearing you.

09:34.527 --> 09:37.079
- Are you really doing gay divorces now?
- We had no idea.

09:37.130 --> 09:38.730
I was just overhearing
you guys overhearing --

09:38.798 --> 09:41.299
Good Lord, it's like a game
of princess telephone.

09:41.333 --> 09:44.135
Here is my card,
and just to be clear,

09:44.169 --> 09:46.104
none of you knew
I was doing gay divorces?

09:46.138 --> 09:47.855
Oh, interesting.

09:47.907 --> 09:49.457
That's very interesting.
Have a good time at the wedding.

09:49.491 --> 09:50.592
- Bye, Jotham.
- Thank you so much.

09:50.900 --> 09:52.684
Well, how about
this ghoulish profession

09:52.718 --> 09:55.053
that no one seems to have
a problem with except for you?

09:55.104 --> 09:57.989
Look, I'm sorry, but you've
always been a little cynical,

09:58.040 --> 10:01.092
and I was worried you seeing
all these marriages collapse

10:01.094 --> 10:02.627
would push you further
in that direction.

10:02.662 --> 10:03.862
No, no, it's the opposite.

10:03.913 --> 10:05.564
Being around
all these unhappy couples

10:05.598 --> 10:07.482
makes me even more grateful
for what we have.

10:07.516 --> 10:08.817
Aww. That's so sweet.

10:08.851 --> 10:11.236
Are -- are you sure
that's not the cash bar talking?

10:11.948 --> 10:13.215
Of course not.

10:13.249 --> 10:15.167
You're the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

10:15.201 --> 10:16.601
Aww.

10:16.603 --> 10:17.469
And you're the best thing

10:17.503 --> 10:18.370
that's ever happened to me.

10:18.372 --> 10:19.504
Oh, Cam.

10:19.555 --> 10:21.056
Maybe this
is why nobody wants us around

10:21.090 --> 10:23.525
is because we cause an emotional
scene everywhere we go.

10:23.576 --> 10:25.210
I'm sorry.

10:25.244 --> 10:27.012
I'll never be
the son he wants.

10:27.046 --> 10:29.865
What's to become of us?

10:32.552 --> 10:34.302
Well, now I'm stumped.

10:34.354 --> 10:36.254
Yep.
That refrigerates stuff.

10:36.289 --> 10:37.322
All of them do.

10:37.356 --> 10:38.623
But you know the saying --

10:38.658 --> 10:41.226
All good open houses must come
to an end by 2:00 on the dot.

10:41.421 --> 10:43.889
- Oh, but my mom's still on her way.
- Ah.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.274
She's giving us
our down payment.

10:45.325 --> 10:46.742
You knew the rules
when you married a drummer.

10:49.096 --> 10:50.279
Are we keeping you
from something?

10:50.313 --> 10:51.897
Not one "beat."

10:52.398 --> 10:53.648
I have an idea.

10:53.683 --> 10:55.284
Why don't we greet your mom

10:55.334 --> 10:57.219
with the smell
of fresh-baked cupcakes?

10:57.253 --> 10:58.687
The ingredients are in here.

10:58.721 --> 10:59.688
Will, grab a whisk.

10:59.722 --> 11:02.122
I'll be back
before you two are frosting.

11:03.092 --> 11:04.893
I'm on my way
to pick it up, Stan.

11:04.944 --> 11:06.628
I'll be there in like 5...

11:06.662 --> 11:09.464
...to 45 minutes.

11:09.515 --> 11:11.600
Okay. Cupcakes.

11:11.634 --> 11:13.919
Pres-- Oh, no. No.

11:13.953 --> 11:15.504
Damn it.

11:15.555 --> 11:18.006
The cupcakes burned.

11:18.255 --> 11:20.306
Oh.
Well, it still smells homey.

11:20.358 --> 11:22.359
And it gives Mom a chance

11:22.410 --> 11:25.879
to see how well this state-of-the-art
smoke alarm works!

11:25.880 --> 11:27.213
Come with me, Mom!

11:27.247 --> 11:29.498
Let me show you around
the rest of this dream house!

11:29.533 --> 11:31.651
You see, even ironing
is a delight here,

11:31.685 --> 11:33.386
where you can feel a cool breeze

11:33.437 --> 11:35.855
wafting in
from the open sliders.

11:36.421 --> 11:37.687
Mother nature!

11:37.721 --> 11:39.822
Huzzah!
Your own gift-wrapping room,

11:39.856 --> 11:41.207
just like the rich and famous.

11:41.241 --> 11:42.241
Sheila, finger.

11:43.644 --> 11:45.027
Go right ahead.
There we go.

11:45.062 --> 11:48.531
Sorry I'm late, guys,
but fear not.

11:48.565 --> 11:50.800
One birthday present.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.018
Wrapped
in baby-shower paper.

11:52.052 --> 11:54.370
One crisply pressed dress.

11:54.404 --> 11:55.921
With one big pleat
it didn't used to have.

11:55.956 --> 11:56.922
Oh.

11:56.957 --> 11:58.057
At least we know
why you were late.

11:58.091 --> 11:59.525
Looks like
you rescued those cupcakes

11:59.576 --> 12:00.826
from a burning bakery.

12:00.861 --> 12:02.795
Don't worry.
Mom made those on the off chance

12:02.829 --> 12:04.680
what everyone knew
was gonna happen happened.

12:04.715 --> 12:06.675
She also bought me
that new dress.

12:07.025 --> 12:08.525
Oh, and I hope
you kept the receipt,

12:08.560 --> 12:09.827
because Mom bought a backup.

12:09.878 --> 12:12.813
Well, don't be mad at your mom
for underestimating me.

12:12.847 --> 12:13.847
Oh, how could we,
when she made us

12:13.898 --> 12:14.948
this fresh hand-churned
ice cream?

12:14.983 --> 12:16.199
- Yeah.
- What?

12:16.247 --> 12:17.381
Oh, you know what we should do?

12:17.415 --> 12:18.682
We should send her
a picture of us eating it.

12:18.733 --> 12:20.551
I guess it's a good thing
I came home when I did.

12:20.585 --> 12:21.335
It'd be better if I did it.

12:21.369 --> 12:22.119
- Yeah.
- Come on.

12:24.595 --> 12:25.712
You churned ice cream?

12:25.747 --> 12:27.197
Yeah.
Did the kids like it?

12:27.248 --> 12:28.498
- They loved it.
- Great.

12:28.549 --> 12:30.434
But they know
I can't make ice cream.

12:30.468 --> 12:32.652
I bought that churn
out of a SkyMall catalog

12:32.703 --> 12:34.204
after three Bloody Marys.

12:34.255 --> 12:37.257
It's been sitting under a tarp
in my garage for six years.

12:37.259 --> 12:39.075
You've got to dial it way back.

12:39.110 --> 12:40.660
Where is this fear and anger
coming from?

12:40.711 --> 12:42.992
You're gonna get us caught!

12:43.974 --> 12:46.325
You knew the risks
when we started this.

12:46.359 --> 12:48.794
- I'm just saying we're getting
a little bit sloppy. - Mm-hmm.

12:48.845 --> 12:51.564
- All the impossible errands,
the fancy sandwiches. - Mm-hmm.

12:51.598 --> 12:53.983
Just slap a little tuna
on whole wheat

12:54.034 --> 12:55.150
- for the next couple of days.
- What? N--

12:55.201 --> 12:57.536
Just until things cool off.

12:57.587 --> 12:59.307
All right?

13:01.174 --> 13:02.694
I was just trying
to make you happy.

13:05.446 --> 13:07.231
You're not gonna stop me,
are you?

13:07.284 --> 13:10.386
Coffee cart's only in the lobby
until 4:00.

13:10.420 --> 13:12.555
Thank you, Claire.

13:12.589 --> 13:13.756
Thank you.

13:13.807 --> 13:15.174
This is mortifying.

13:15.176 --> 13:16.509
Whoever we ask to fix this

13:16.511 --> 13:18.844
is gonna see what we're watching
and think we're pervs.

13:18.895 --> 13:20.262
Not that guy.

13:20.313 --> 13:21.931
Luke?!

13:23.266 --> 13:25.851
Oh! Hi, Marianne.

13:25.853 --> 13:28.938
Oh, wow!
You're so grown-up now.

13:28.989 --> 13:30.773
- Yeah. Uh, this is Manny.
- Hi.

13:30.824 --> 13:32.691
Marianne used to be
our babysitter.

13:32.742 --> 13:34.462
Remember when you asked me
to marry you?

13:34.494 --> 13:36.245
"I wuv you, Marianne."

13:36.279 --> 13:38.414
Well, nice to meet you.
We should get going.

13:38.498 --> 13:39.950
Okay. Bye, guys.
Best to your family, okay?

13:40.576 --> 13:41.659
Phew.

13:41.693 --> 13:43.494
I'd like to see
the look on Mawianne's face

13:43.529 --> 13:45.446
if she knew what
a degenerate you turned into.

13:45.497 --> 13:46.414
Next.

13:46.448 --> 13:47.899
I'm here, Kyle.

13:48.534 --> 13:50.117
Oh!
Hello again.

13:50.168 --> 13:51.368
How can I help?

13:54.191 --> 13:56.591
What are we gonna do?
Mom's gonna be home any minute.

13:56.645 --> 13:58.745
"Hola, papi.
Have you seen my computer?"

13:58.788 --> 13:59.921
"Oh, sure, Mom.
It's over there,

13:59.955 --> 14:01.155
where that naked girl's
entertaining

14:01.190 --> 14:02.223
her school's
basketball team."

14:02.389 --> 14:04.456
I'm face-timing Alex.
She'll know what to do.

14:04.491 --> 14:05.424
What's up, Luke?

14:05.458 --> 14:07.092
Computer glitch.
The screen's frozen.

14:07.143 --> 14:08.744
- Let me see.
- I'd rather not.

14:08.778 --> 14:09.962
So porn.

14:09.996 --> 14:11.163
Well, I just
have to finish this paper.

14:11.197 --> 14:12.047
I'll call you in an hour.

14:12.098 --> 14:13.932
Oh, hey there, cutie pie.

14:13.934 --> 14:15.367
Thank you, Alex,
but could you please hurry

14:15.418 --> 14:16.501
- and call us back?
- I was talk--

14:17.671 --> 14:19.154
She knows I'm forbidden fruit.

14:19.189 --> 14:21.509
I'm sure that's half the appeal.

14:36.517 --> 14:37.868
Jay!

14:37.902 --> 14:39.036
Jay?

14:41.990 --> 14:43.874
How long since you have been up?

14:43.908 --> 14:45.659
Oh, about a minute before you.

14:45.861 --> 14:47.844
Oh, can you do me a favor?

14:47.879 --> 14:49.529
Can you go
and look at the laundry?

14:49.563 --> 14:50.547
I think it's done.

14:50.633 --> 14:52.267
Sure, but, honey, I think
I slept kind of weird.

14:52.318 --> 14:54.419
Could you run back upstairs
and get me my heating pad?

14:56.306 --> 14:57.773
Why is Stella going crazy there?

14:57.824 --> 14:59.658
Stella, get out of here!

14:59.692 --> 15:03.462
Oh. Hi, there.
How's everybody doing?

15:03.496 --> 15:04.529
What's up with Stella?

15:04.564 --> 15:05.647
Where have you two been?

15:05.803 --> 15:07.521
Is that my computer?!

15:07.572 --> 15:08.822
- Don't open that!
- Don't open that!

15:09.807 --> 15:11.608
- Is that Joe's plane?
- Don't open that!

15:12.542 --> 15:16.245
A lot of unanswered questions
here, it seems like.

15:16.991 --> 15:20.545
Why don't we all
just... take a step back?

15:20.872 --> 15:23.609
Nice and easy.

15:24.843 --> 15:26.245
Okay, so...

15:27.948 --> 15:30.549
now I am going to go
and take a little walk.

15:32.386 --> 15:35.121
Luke and I have some homework
to do upstairs.

15:35.155 --> 15:38.891
And I'm going...
to the little boy's room.

15:44.343 --> 15:47.028
They have taken pictures
at every table but ours.

15:47.079 --> 15:49.114
Because their photographer
isn't Diane Arbus.

15:49.148 --> 15:51.299
Who else would want a record
of this fever dream?

15:51.350 --> 15:53.451
Oh!
Are you gonna finish this?

15:53.486 --> 15:55.236
They didn't budget a staff meal.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.055
It's our own fault we're poor.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.557
When we had money, we spent
it all on drunken sailors.

15:59.608 --> 16:01.026
You mean "like drunken sailors"?

16:01.077 --> 16:02.293
Sure.

16:02.565 --> 16:04.165
Pepper,
before you run off again,

16:04.200 --> 16:06.560
why is almost everyone here
treating us like pariahs?

16:06.602 --> 16:08.937
Well, you didn't help yourselves
by the cold way

16:08.988 --> 16:10.872
you declined those last two
wedding invitations.

16:10.923 --> 16:12.507
We didn't get those invitations.

16:12.558 --> 16:15.743
I got the RSVPs myself to
Adam and Michael and Felix and Jordan.

16:15.978 --> 16:19.064
Just a big "X"
in the "will not attend" box.

16:19.066 --> 16:20.465
No excuse, no gift.

16:20.499 --> 16:24.035
Of course you put people off.
It's just not classy.

16:26.706 --> 16:29.026
How old are these pudding cups?!

16:29.058 --> 16:30.008
Come, cariño.

16:30.059 --> 16:31.343
There's a vending machine
in the lobby.

16:31.394 --> 16:34.996
If I lie down next to it,
will you push it over on me?

16:35.031 --> 16:38.049
How could we RSVP to wedding
invitations that we never got?

16:38.100 --> 16:40.819
Okay, party people,
on your feet.

16:40.870 --> 16:42.387
You guys cool if I take off?

16:42.421 --> 16:44.088
No. Sweetie, what's been
going on with you?

16:44.143 --> 16:45.610
You've wanted to leave
since we got here.

16:45.645 --> 16:47.562
Hey, y'all coming?

16:47.613 --> 16:48.530
Might as well.

16:48.581 --> 16:49.831
Come on, Lily.
Let's go dance.

16:49.866 --> 16:52.017
No! No dancing.
It's too embarrassing.

16:52.051 --> 16:54.436
No. You're a good dancer,
sweetie.

16:54.503 --> 16:56.538
- Not me. You two.
- What?

16:56.589 --> 16:59.174
You don't like our dancing?
Why?

16:59.225 --> 17:00.308
Why?

17:08.807 --> 17:11.358
You're not good.
That's why I hate weddings.

17:11.393 --> 17:14.211
Wait, Lily, did you RSVP to
some weddings and not tell us?

17:14.244 --> 17:17.513
Yes. Punish me, ground me.
I just can't watch it again.

17:17.516 --> 17:18.565
Oh, you're gonna be punished.

17:18.616 --> 17:20.200
Mitchell, wait.
I know how she feels.

17:20.234 --> 17:21.835
Did we really embarrass you
that bad?

17:21.886 --> 17:25.489
Well, yeah. I mean,
I still love you, but...

17:25.522 --> 17:27.207
Why are your shoulders moving?

17:27.242 --> 17:29.560
Well, we always knew there would be
something you didn't like about us.

17:29.594 --> 17:31.929
We're just glad that
it's something we're so good at.

17:39.743 --> 17:42.428
If anybody asks, I'm with you.

17:44.748 --> 17:46.915
Yes, Gavin,
I got everything you asked for,

17:46.967 --> 17:48.100
and I'm on my way.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.685
All these errands I have to do
for my boss.

17:49.687 --> 17:52.004
I swear, if it wasn't for me,
he'd never get anything.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.555
Haley, please.
I'm trying to figure out

17:53.590 --> 17:56.325
how your mom's getting all
these things done by herself.

17:56.359 --> 17:58.994
When Haley finally gave me
a chance to hear myself think,

17:59.029 --> 17:59.995
it hit me.

18:00.029 --> 18:01.864
Could Claire
be using an assistant?

18:01.898 --> 18:05.134
I decided to retrace every
errand she allegedly ran today

18:05.168 --> 18:06.301
and time it out.

18:07.022 --> 18:10.458
She was in meetings
from 9:00 A.M. to 1:30,

18:10.513 --> 18:13.448
leaving her a 90-minute window
to buy Haley's dress,

18:13.483 --> 18:16.552
see Stan at Best Buy
for Alex's present,

18:16.586 --> 18:21.039
then speed home, where she could
start baking the cupcakes,

18:21.074 --> 18:23.425
drag the churn in
from the garage,

18:23.459 --> 18:27.663
churn, wrap, and frost,

18:27.697 --> 18:29.998
leaving her a scant eight
minutes at school pick-up time

18:30.033 --> 18:32.401
to race back
for her 3:00 staff meeting.

18:32.435 --> 18:35.771
Even if all 14 traffic lights
on her route were green,

18:35.872 --> 18:37.489
this task would be...

18:37.540 --> 18:39.224
Impossible.

18:39.765 --> 18:41.950
I don't know
who made that ice cream,

18:41.984 --> 18:44.152
but Daddy was about
to churn up a frosty bowl

18:44.187 --> 18:45.804
of "Mom's a big fake."

18:47.448 --> 18:49.633
Ben,
what are you still doing here?

18:49.673 --> 18:51.074
I'm just making sandwiches
for the kids.

18:51.125 --> 18:52.375
Don't worry.
They'll never know.

18:52.409 --> 18:54.978
I'm using store-brand Gouda
and this domestic mustard.

18:55.012 --> 18:56.279
No, you don't understand.

18:56.313 --> 18:58.248
My husband could be home
any minute.

18:58.282 --> 18:59.499
You've got to leave.

19:00.751 --> 19:01.851
What is this?

19:01.886 --> 19:04.053
"Thanks for the advice, Mom.
It worked great."

19:04.055 --> 19:05.154
- Nice.
- What advice?

19:05.496 --> 19:07.297
Oh, well, you left your phone
on your desk,

19:07.331 --> 19:09.315
and Alex texted when
you were in that staff meeting.

19:09.350 --> 19:11.150
She seemed really upset,
so I took care of it.

19:11.185 --> 19:12.452
It was, like, boy stuff,
whatever.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.504
Ben, we got to stop doing this.

19:14.538 --> 19:16.172
No, it's fine. I just said
what you would have said.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.641
But I didn't say anything.

19:18.692 --> 19:21.778
I-I wasn't there for my daughter
at all.

19:21.780 --> 19:25.381
I-I'm so damn busy
trying to be the perfect mom

19:25.432 --> 19:27.350
and -- and the perfect boss,

19:27.384 --> 19:29.886
but I'm outsourcing the one job
that means the most to me,

19:29.920 --> 19:30.820
and I really miss it.

19:30.822 --> 19:31.954
I miss being a mom.

19:31.989 --> 19:33.373
Even if I'm a so-so mom

19:33.407 --> 19:36.876
that barely has time to make
a soggy tuna-fish sandwich, I...

19:36.927 --> 19:38.461
Okay.

19:38.512 --> 19:40.129
- Then you should get back to that.
- Yeah.

19:40.509 --> 19:41.793
And I should get back
to the office.

19:41.844 --> 19:43.545
Oh, no.
Ben, you don't have to do that.

19:43.596 --> 19:44.546
It's so late.

19:44.597 --> 19:45.797
No, I do.

19:45.799 --> 19:47.465
My mom's got a "date"
with her new boyfriend,

19:47.516 --> 19:49.956
so I'm gonna crash
in the showroom.

20:15.494 --> 20:17.328
Thank you.

20:20.488 --> 20:22.638
So, before you open this,
I just want to say

20:22.714 --> 20:24.814
this is not the kind of thing
I'm usually in to.

20:24.837 --> 20:25.954
Let's not.

20:26.005 --> 20:27.125
It's all him, by the way.

20:27.131 --> 20:28.131
No kidding.

20:28.646 --> 20:30.179
Oh, don't show it to me!

20:30.264 --> 20:31.264
Oh!

20:32.709 --> 20:35.542
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

20:35.725 --> 20:36.725
CTRL-Alt-Ew.

20:36.749 --> 20:38.749
Oh, God.
Please, tell me it worked.

20:39.243 --> 20:40.576
It worked.

20:42.229 --> 20:44.996
Just so you know, women are not
all vacuous nymphomaniacs

20:45.042 --> 20:47.342
looking to seduce every man
that crosses their path.

20:48.894 --> 20:50.627
Bye, you dirty little boy!

20:52.247 --> 20:53.980
Kind of a mixed message,
right?

20:54.050 --> 20:55.183
I'll talk to her.

20:55.207 --> 20:57.207
