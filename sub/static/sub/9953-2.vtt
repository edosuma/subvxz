WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:02.707
- Previously on Haven...

00:04.046 --> 00:05.001
- Parker?

00:05.172 --> 00:06.958
What did you do with her?
- Audrey is missing?

00:07.090 --> 00:09.126
I swear I didn't do anything to her.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.795
- I'm gonna ask you one more time.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.259
Where's the Colorado Kid?

00:12.596 --> 00:14.803
You think I don't know
you two are the same person?

00:14.932 --> 00:16.638
- Who are you?

00:16.808 --> 00:18.389
- Somebody who deserves
to be told the truth.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.300
You think you're the only one
who loved him?

00:20.479 --> 00:22.094
- You have a responsibility, Duke.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.012
- Duke.
(groans)

00:24.191 --> 00:25.897
What's going on?

00:26.610 --> 00:28.942
No!
(shouts)

00:29.696 --> 00:31.687
- Why do you have that thing?!
- If you're supposed to die

00:31.865 --> 00:33.901
at the hands of someone
with this tattoo,

00:34.076 --> 00:35.907
I need to be on the approved list.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.534
- I'm not my father.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.819
- Parker.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.239
- Is the Colorado Kid still alive?
- No.

00:42.417 --> 00:46.205
I helped bury him myself.
Lot 301.

00:48.131 --> 00:51.089
(Audrey): The Colorado Kid
could still be alive.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.425
(Vince): "Find him before the Hunter."
- Who's the Hunter?

00:53.554 --> 00:55.260
And who the hell wrote it?
- I did.

01:00.102 --> 01:02.218
(seagull oaws)

01:10.320 --> 01:11.856
(bell rings)

01:12.906 --> 01:14.112
(sighs)

01:14.825 --> 01:17.817
- Yeah, the sign says "Pull", genius.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.531
(bell rings)

01:24.001 --> 01:26.117
l have video surveillance...

01:26.253 --> 01:27.789
and a big bat.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.048
(bell rings)

01:41.852 --> 01:43.183
You know, son,

01:43.353 --> 01:47.312
back in my day, we could have fun
without the crystal mescaline.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.402
What in the hell happened to you?

01:57.451 --> 01:59.487
(snarls)

02:06.543 --> 02:07.908
- 27 years ago,

02:08.086 --> 02:09.417
you're Lucy...

02:10.297 --> 02:14.040
and you write this
inside the Colorado Kid's grave.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.003
"Find him before the Hunter."

02:18.263 --> 02:20.925
Couldn't have written yourself
a more specific note?

02:21.058 --> 02:23.595
- Well, it looks like I only had ten seconds
to write it.

02:23.769 --> 02:26.385
- I gotta tell you, if I were gonna have
to live multiple lives,

02:26.563 --> 02:28.519
I would have picked someplace
more exotic, you know?

02:28.690 --> 02:32.399
Warmer climate...
Bali, Costa Rica, Hong Kong.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.655
How's that thing healing?

02:35.822 --> 02:37.153
- It's fine.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.399
I keep thinking
about the man who abducted me.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.910
He said I loved the Colorado Kid.

02:44.081 --> 02:47.164
- He was supposedly buried 27 years ago,
but now,

02:47.334 --> 02:49.416
his grave is empty.

02:49.586 --> 02:53.078
- I think he's alive,
and I think he's on the run.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.507
(rustling)

02:58.553 --> 03:00.089
- You expecting somebody?

03:18.657 --> 03:19.692
Morning, Chief.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.112
- What are you doing here?

03:23.286 --> 03:25.242
- In case you forgot,
Audrey got abducted.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.826
l'm changing the locks.
- You're changing the locks?

03:27.999 --> 03:31.082
- Yeah, I'm changing the locks,
but you know, then we...

03:31.253 --> 03:33.118
we got to chatting, favourite coffees,

03:33.255 --> 03:35.496
scented candles... Girl talk.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.384
- You told him everything?
About the Hunter?

03:42.305 --> 03:44.045
- Yeah, we're friends.
Is that a problem?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.180
- Come on. Your dad?

03:46.309 --> 03:48.925
You ever think
maybe you're the Hunter, Duke?

03:51.314 --> 03:53.976
- No... Never.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.393
- Well, I guess we won't know
until you kill somebody.

03:59.448 --> 04:02.030
We've got a 10-11 call,
we gotta go.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.156
- Lock the doors when you're done,

04:04.286 --> 04:05.947
please, Duke?
- Yeah.

04:11.793 --> 04:12.999
- Stay away from her.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.706
(scoffs)

04:14.838 --> 04:18.296
- No. But... I'll tell you
what I will do, Nate.

04:18.467 --> 04:21.174
I'm gonna find out
who this Hunter really is.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.795
I'm gonna actually do something
to help Audrey.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.147
- I told the freak
he was on surveillance.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.933
He didn't give a rat's ass.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.440
This guy is messed up.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.738
And he's paying for that.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.533
- Thank you, sir.
Please stand back.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.333
- Somebody had him chained up?

04:55.504 --> 04:56.994
- You think he's Troubled?

04:58.507 --> 04:59.917
- I think he's cold.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.006
- Could be cold.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.542
- Give me your coat.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.054
- He could also be dangerous.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.678
Could be contagious.
- Give me your coat.

05:06.848 --> 05:10.466
- I don't think that's a good idea, Parker.
(bell rings)

05:13.104 --> 05:14.059
- Hey.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.306
Hey, are you okay?
Are you hurt?

05:21.947 --> 05:23.357
You cold?

05:27.536 --> 05:28.696
Here, have a coat.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.908
It's okay.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.038
(bell rings)

05:38.213 --> 05:39.953
- You're just gonna give him a coat?

05:40.131 --> 05:41.667
- Sir, outside, now!

05:41.842 --> 05:43.833
- And how about you arrest his ass
and get him out of my store?!

05:44.010 --> 05:45.216
Hey! Hey!

05:45.387 --> 05:46.968
(growls)

05:47.931 --> 05:49.216
- Let him go!

05:56.815 --> 05:58.430
- Call an ambulance!

06:02.529 --> 06:05.396
(theme music)

06:41.192 --> 06:43.183
(indistinct chatter)

06:43.361 --> 06:45.147
- Thanks, bye.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.611
-So, uh...

06:51.828 --> 06:54.615
How long have you been covering up
what happens in this town?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.909
- Small talk?
- Okay.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.490
What do you know about the Hunter?

06:58.668 --> 07:00.374
- Why?
- Book report.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.001
Come on.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.379
I know you're the cleaner, right?

07:04.507 --> 07:05.838
You keep a lid on things.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.549
I'm just wondering
if you kept the lid on him.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.835
- No.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.258
- Look, hey.

07:12.682 --> 07:16.425
I am asking for help for Audrey.
Okay?

07:17.896 --> 07:18.976
You don't know anything?

07:22.484 --> 07:25.226
- I know that if you and I
ever went again,

07:25.362 --> 07:27.774
but I didn't supercharge you
with my blood,

07:27.906 --> 07:30.989
things might go different.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.235
- Nice talking to you.

07:42.003 --> 07:45.587
- I lost him near Wrightson Hollow,
so just start south of there.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.544
- No missing violent psych patients.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.292
I'm guessing our naked biter
is Troubled.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.051
Did you put out the APB?

07:52.222 --> 07:55.214
Male, Caucasian, 40s,
wearing only a rope.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.924
- Hey, um, is that tranq gun ready?

08:02.774 --> 08:04.560
- Detective Parker?
- Yeah.

08:04.693 --> 08:05.933
- l'm Dr. Callahan.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.817
- Can I help you?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.274
- Well, l was hoping
that I could help you.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.238
I'm a psychiatrist.
- Oh, you know what?

08:12.367 --> 08:14.779
We actually don't even have
a suspect in custody yet--

08:14.995 --> 08:17.737
- No, no, detective.
I'm here for you.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.529
- Me? Why?

08:19.708 --> 08:22.950
- Officially, it's required.
You were abducted.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.870
And any civil employee
that carries a weapon

08:26.047 --> 08:27.583
needs a psych evaluation
after that kind of trauma.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.418
- Says who?

08:29.551 --> 08:32.793
- Says years of psychiatric research

08:32.971 --> 08:35.212
and the town's insurance carrier.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.430
You know, there's no reason
to be alarmed here.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.551
- How old are you?

08:40.729 --> 08:41.889
- I'm 28.

08:42.063 --> 08:46.147
And I am detecting something
in your tone, detective.

08:46.317 --> 08:49.104
- Okay, let me make this
perfectly clear.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.857
I'm not gonna talk to you.

08:52.824 --> 08:56.362
- Look, normally we could do
this whole therapy courtship thing

08:56.536 --> 08:58.242
where you sat on my couch
and we talked about the cushions

08:58.413 --> 09:00.199
for six months till you learn to trust me,

09:00.373 --> 09:03.661
and then we'd get right into it,
but we don't have that kind of time.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.660
- What do you mean?
- I know what you do for this town,

09:06.838 --> 09:08.669
and if you think
that you don't need therapy,

09:08.840 --> 09:11.957
well... you really need therapy.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.716
- We found him.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.920
- Nathan, this is Dr. Callahan.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.054
She's a shrink.
We needed to talk.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.183
We did, and | feel much better.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.686
- Well, imagine how good you're gonna feel
after one of our required sessions.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.649
- That might not be such a bad idea.
You did give my coat to a zombie,

09:29.778 --> 09:33.612
and you almost let Duke stab me--
- We're gonna talk about this in the car.

09:37.911 --> 09:38.866
- So I see him,

09:39.037 --> 09:40.868
l yell at him, "Hey,
get the hell out of my barn!"

09:41.039 --> 09:43.075
He turns around,
he gives me the stink eye.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.823
Unbelievable!
- Dad!

09:45.001 --> 09:46.866
- Liam, go back inside the house.

09:47.045 --> 09:51.379
- I can't find Jessie!
- Just turn on the damn Disney, please!

09:52.300 --> 09:55.258
- Wait, who's... who's Jessie?
- A dog.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.253
It's just me and the kid up here
since his mom left.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.137
(Nathan): Ready?

10:18.743 --> 10:20.779
I think we found Jessie the dog.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.195
(flies buzzing)

10:30.588 --> 10:32.499
(quietly): Parker.
(Parker gasping)

10:58.741 --> 10:59.901
(quietly): Parker.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.604
We use the tranq gun on one,
the rest will hear it and come after us.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.602
- It's not like we can start shooting them.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.401
I mean, they may be Troubled,
but they are people.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.740
I wish we could just call
a bunch of backup.

11:42.869 --> 11:43.858
- And say what?

11:44.037 --> 11:47.279
We've got eight to ten cavemen in a barn?
We've discovered the missing link?

11:47.457 --> 11:49.163
- Why do you think they're here?
Shelter?

11:49.334 --> 11:51.666
- I don't know.
Let's give it to 'em.

11:51.794 --> 11:55.002
At least keep them contained
till we can figure out what's going on.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.167
Mr. Magnusson.
- Yeah?

11:57.342 --> 11:58.297
- Can you lock that barn?

11:59.010 --> 12:00.375
- Lock him in?
- Them.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.054
We need to lock them in.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.338
- Them?

12:04.474 --> 12:06.135
Look, this isn't even a working farm.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.298
The doors don't lock.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.718
I might have some old crossbars somewhere.
- Get those.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.229
- I'm gonna pull the truck up,
see if I can block those doors.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.685
(cellphone rings)
- Okay, and I'll check the other exits.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.319
- Be careful.
(phone beeping)

12:17.487 --> 12:19.068
- I'm pretty busy now, Duke.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.606
- ljust thought you might like to know
that there is a very large naked man

12:22.784 --> 12:24.740
eating raw fish by the south docks.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.110
Kind of looks like he should be
in a Bowflex commercial.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.324
By that I mean he’s,
like, jacked, juiced,

12:29.499 --> 12:31.410
and now he's staring at me.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.157
- So much for containment.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.247
- I don't speak cop,
what are you talking about?

12:35.421 --> 12:37.833
- We're dealing
with a bunch of those guys here.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.168
We think that they're Troubled.
They're definitely dangerous.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.299
Listen, can you restrain him?

12:47.517 --> 12:48.597
- Sure.

12:51.020 --> 12:51.975
Hi, Dwight.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.391
l, uh... got Audrey on the phone.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.106
She, uh...
she wants you to restrain that guy.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.405
(growls)

13:07.203 --> 13:08.488
- Hey.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.494
Hey!

13:16.462 --> 13:20.330
Come on, come on. Follow me.
Liam snuck into the barn.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.768
- We'll find the kid faster if we split up.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.739
(growling)

14:00.256 --> 14:04.499
(growling continues)

14:16.522 --> 14:19.605
(growling)

14:21.027 --> 14:22.437
(snarling)

14:46.094 --> 14:47.174
- Okay, shh.

14:50.473 --> 14:53.465
(sniffs)

14:53.643 --> 14:55.474
(growls)

15:20.044 --> 15:21.705
(sniffin
9
Shh! )

15:37.603 --> 15:38.979
(gaSDS)

15:42.316 --> 15:43.897
(sniffs)

15:49.866 --> 15:51.151
(growls)

15:51.284 --> 15:52.524
(sniffs)

15:57.373 --> 15:58.408
(whispers): No!

16:12.722 --> 16:14.303
(Liam whimpering)

16:14.348 --> 16:15.679
(growling)

16:15.850 --> 16:17.056
(pounding on door)

16:17.226 --> 16:18.841
(growls)

16:20.563 --> 16:24.351
(growls)
(door splintering)

16:25.860 --> 16:27.600
(electricity crackling)
(screams)

16:28.696 --> 16:30.027
(electricity crackling)

16:38.706 --> 16:39.991
- Don't move!

16:41.167 --> 16:42.657
(growls)

16:44.337 --> 16:45.497
(gunshot)

16:48.382 --> 16:49.542
(snarls)

16:55.932 --> 16:57.092
(growling)

17:14.992 --> 17:18.484
- Liam, why don't you ever listen
to what I say?

17:32.593 --> 17:34.504
- We'll get him to the hospital,

17:34.637 --> 17:36.548
run some tests, get some prints.

17:38.516 --> 17:39.471
- No! No!

17:39.809 --> 17:41.390
Don't shoot.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.599
This one's different.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.940
He didn't attack me.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.946
Who are you people?

18:05.001 --> 18:06.912
(bell rings)

18:10.423 --> 18:12.835
- Where were you?
- I paid a visit to the morgue.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.628
I wanted to learn a little bit more

18:14.802 --> 18:18.715
about who Audrey's abductor
murdered last week.

18:18.889 --> 18:22.882
Roslyn Toomey's full autopsy
just came in.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.142
- Lucassi gave you that?
- lt's Wednesday.

18:25.313 --> 18:27.178
He's surfing in Ogunquit.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.148
Well, I'll give it back.
He'll never know.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.265
- You're out of control.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.731
- Read the cause of death.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.905
- "Deceased suffered
a half-inch diameter trauma

18:42.038 --> 18:43.903
"to the base of the skull
and brain stem

18:44.081 --> 18:47.039
consistent with... a bolt gun"?

18:47.168 --> 18:48.749
- lt shoots a bolt.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.705
It's made for killing livestock.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.917
And someone kidnapped Audrey
and knows more

18:54.091 --> 18:57.879
about the Colorado Kid than us
is using it on people!

19:05.061 --> 19:06.551
- Here you go.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.225
You like cookies, right?

19:17.198 --> 19:21.658
You have no idea
what's happened to you, do you?

19:24.580 --> 19:26.741
It's scary, huh?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.332
- How's your new friend?

19:30.461 --> 19:32.417
- Easy to talk to.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.169
- You should try me.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.504
I can write prescriptions.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.248
- I prefer the mute, thanks.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.923
- Rudeness. That's a good sign.
Means I'm getting to you.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.383
- Just please go
social-work someone else.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.718
- I did my undergrad at Yale
and my MD at UConn.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.509
I am a psychiatrist,
not a social worker.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.186
- How's it going?

19:51.357 --> 19:52.847
- I haven't had a chance
to examine him yet,

19:53.025 --> 19:56.017
and I've been trading calls with the hospital
about the other one's blood work.

19:57.488 --> 19:58.853
- Wait, you...

20:02.993 --> 20:07.236
You didn't come to talk to me?

20:07.415 --> 20:10.452
- I sent her in here
to talk to that guy.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.836
- And then detective Parker
and I got to talking,

20:13.003 --> 20:15.255
and it's...
it's been illuminating.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.754
There's a volatility in there
that I need to see in the field.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.177
I need to shadow you at work today.

20:30.354 --> 20:33.767
- Come on, Dwight's got a problem.
(sighs)

20:42.199 --> 20:43.939
How'd he end up in your truck?

20:44.118 --> 20:46.734
- Tried to load him in the bed,
but he broke free.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.077
If I'd... had a little help...

20:52.126 --> 20:54.208
- Only thing I could do
was trap him in the cab.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.709
Wicked strong.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.087
- He can't get out?
(car beeping)

20:58.215 --> 21:00.627
- Doors are locked.
No buttons inside.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.917
I don't know
if he knows how to get out.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.273
- You okay?
- Yeah.

21:22.907 --> 21:23.942
Yeah.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.066
- Ah!

21:28.078 --> 21:29.693
- Uh, guys?

21:29.872 --> 21:30.987
- Damn it!

21:32.583 --> 21:34.574
This is why I didn't want
to get near him!

21:46.931 --> 21:48.512
Nothing happened.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.474
Yes! Thank you!

21:56.607 --> 21:59.690
See? You can beat the Troubles!

22:01.070 --> 22:02.185
- Maybe he's not Troubled.

22:02.363 --> 22:03.318
- Uh, What?

22:03.447 --> 22:05.187
- He might not be.
- No, what...

22:05.366 --> 22:07.322
Excuse me, I'm sor...
Who... who are you again?

22:07.493 --> 22:09.279
Wait, don't... don't tell me.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.867
Another Audrey Parker.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.653
- l'm Claire Callahan.
I'm a psychiatrist.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.039
And this guyjust might be
drugged out of his mind.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.245
- What do you mean?
- The one at the hospital,

22:17.419 --> 22:20.377
they found Acepromazine in his blood.
It's an animal tranquilizer.

22:20.548 --> 22:21.537
- We never tranq'd him.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.546
- Even if you did,
it wouldn't have been with this.

22:23.717 --> 22:27.380
They give this to dogs they're about
to put down. It's liquid lobotomy.

22:27.555 --> 22:28.670
I couldn't even prescribe it.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.804
- Who could?

22:34.687 --> 22:36.803
Haven PD. Hello?

22:48.284 --> 22:51.071
- So you think the dogcatcher
is injecting drugs into these people,

22:51.203 --> 22:52.784
that this isn't a Trouble?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.199
- It could be.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.823
I mean, I've seen drugs
make people do crazy things.

22:58.002 --> 23:00.664
But honestly, nothing quite like this.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.880
- Parker?

23:15.352 --> 23:17.183
- Excuse me.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.604
- Looks like his neck is broken.
He's dead.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.575
- This is the other half

23:33.746 --> 23:36.237
of what that first savage
was wearing at the gas station.

23:37.207 --> 23:42.668
- So the dogcatcher is...
treating them like dogs?

23:42.838 --> 23:44.703
- No. This is a Trouble.

23:44.882 --> 23:46.713
The behaviour, the biting,

23:47.134 --> 23:49.125
the animal drug in their systems.

23:49.303 --> 23:50.918
How could you get a man in there?

23:51.096 --> 23:53.303
- You couldn't.
- Exactly.

23:53.474 --> 23:56.966
He was in that cage
when he turned into a man.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.017
These men...

24:02.316 --> 24:05.183
I think they're the dogs
from this place.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.729
(Claire screaming)

24:21.752 --> 24:23.834
Looks like you found our dogcatcher.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.086
Must not be his Trouble.

24:26.840 --> 24:30.253
- Well, most of the dogs here
were probably feral, aggressive.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.383
- They used a hammer.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.294
They killed him as men.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.256
- Tools.

24:38.727 --> 24:42.515
If they're human,
they have brand-new human brains.

24:42.690 --> 24:45.853
- So, take the feral and aggressive,

24:45.985 --> 24:48.647
and add getting smarter.

24:59.373 --> 25:02.831
- Anybody knows who the Hunter is,
it's Vince and Dave.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.835
- Yeah, but in my experience,
the problem is getting them to talk.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.745
- I can help you there.
- Okay...

25:07.923 --> 25:09.709
I don't want to ruin
this nice little moment

25:09.883 --> 25:13.421
that's happening between us,
but... why are you helping me now?

25:13.595 --> 25:16.007
- I saw the way you reacted
when that blood got on you.

25:16.181 --> 25:19.639
You hate your... problem.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.391
(scoffs)
- It's not my problem.

25:21.562 --> 25:22.847
(bell rings)

25:26.275 --> 25:27.811
Bartles.

25:27.985 --> 25:29.350
- Jaymes.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.815
- Duke's looking for info on the Hunter.

25:31.989 --> 25:34.321
- We told Audrey we can't help.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.072
- How about you just let us
look at some old Haven Heralds

25:36.243 --> 25:37.858
around the time
of the Colorado Kid murder,

25:38.037 --> 25:39.777
'cause otherwise,
we might start thinking

25:39.955 --> 25:42.742
that you're actually trying
to keep something secret.

25:42.916 --> 25:43.951
- Makes sense to me.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.785
- l'll... I'll look in the back room
for some old copies,

25:47.921 --> 25:50.879
but I doubt that there's any there.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.665
(whispers): Give them nothing.
- Of course.

25:54.845 --> 25:59.555
- A Troubled person has to be connected
to these... dogs.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.219
- Okay.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.512
So where did they go
after they were set free?

26:03.645 --> 26:06.227
See if we can connect them
to a person that way.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.309
- First was Lambert's store.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.603
- I've seen feral dogs
hang out there looking for food.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.736
- Same at south docks,
where Duke found that first one.

26:13.906 --> 26:17.490
- So they're wild dogs going
to where they know they could find food.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.787
- Well, then why would they go to Tor's barn?
The only food there was... what?

26:20.954 --> 26:23.161
Tor's pet dog?

26:23.332 --> 26:24.913
- No.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.704
It must have been a different dead animal
we found there.

26:27.878 --> 26:30.244
Tor Magnusson dropped off his dog here.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.631
6:30 last night.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.835
- His dog is one of the men?

26:35.302 --> 26:37.418
It must be Tor's Trouble doing this.

26:37.554 --> 26:38.509
- Or his son's.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.341
Kid was looking for his dog,
Jessie, this morning.

26:40.474 --> 26:42.385
- He didn't tell him
he dropped him off here.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.299
- Let's go see our dad of the year.

26:44.478 --> 26:48.391
- Yeah, I left my dog at the pound
last night to be put down.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.973
- Anything seem weird?
- Yeah,

26:51.151 --> 26:53.267
they didn't give me my medal.
Look, are we done here? I'm kind of busy.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.400
- No, we're not done.

26:54.571 --> 26:57.779
Tell us exactly what happened
when you dropped the dog off.

26:59.201 --> 27:02.238
- You know, actually,
it was kind of strange.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.495
When I went in there,

27:05.624 --> 27:08.331
all the dogs are barking
their heads off, you know?

27:08.460 --> 27:09.700
And then...

27:11.964 --> 27:15.206
I went inside,
left my dog with the other dogs,

27:15.342 --> 27:16.843
went back outside,

27:17.010 --> 27:21.219
and the barking...
it just stopped.

27:22.266 --> 27:24.507
l-l figured maybe
they only bark at visitors.

27:24.685 --> 27:27.222
I don't know. It was weird.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.057
- Maybe that's when they changed.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.304
- Yeah, but why?

27:30.440 --> 27:32.226
- Sir, may I speak with your son?

27:32.359 --> 27:34.896
- Yeah. He's inside.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.938
What's going on?
What happened to the dogs?

27:39.116 --> 27:40.151
- Mr. Magnusson,

27:40.325 --> 27:42.941
have you heard of the Troubles?

27:43.120 --> 27:45.031
Because we think you have one.

27:51.128 --> 27:52.584
(sighs)

27:58.802 --> 27:59.837
- Take a look at this.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.632
"Local woman vanishes."

28:03.557 --> 28:04.717
lt's Audrey.

28:04.892 --> 28:08.009
- That's Lucy.
That's who she was back then.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.980
- Looks like we have
our lead story for tomorrow.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.449
Perhaps you gentlemen
would care to join me?

28:24.870 --> 28:25.905
Help?

28:25.954 --> 28:27.615
(gate creaks)

28:29.166 --> 28:31.122
- Look...
(bell rings)

28:34.421 --> 28:36.127
Yeah, you guys got this.

28:39.593 --> 28:40.958
"The Hunter."

28:51.271 --> 28:53.057
- What happened to this farm?

28:53.190 --> 28:54.225
You kept animals?

28:54.399 --> 28:56.731
- My grandparents swore 'em off.
They made my parents and me

28:56.902 --> 28:58.984
swear 'em off too.
- Maybe that's why.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.481
Maybe when people in your family

29:00.614 --> 29:03.481
try to slaughter animals,
they become human.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.699
- This is insane.
It's a damn dog!

29:05.869 --> 29:07.450
- Why did you get one?
- It's my son's.

29:07.621 --> 29:09.657
I didn't want one, believe me.

29:09.790 --> 29:13.533
And... I had to destroy it.
It had rabies.

29:13.669 --> 29:16.502
- That means one of these men has rabies now?
- Hey!

29:17.673 --> 29:20.540
I can't find Liam!
And I think you all need to see this!

29:20.717 --> 29:23.754
- That's Liam's puzzle.

29:26.682 --> 29:31.767
Wait, so you think
a dog man thing took my son?

29:31.937 --> 29:35.429
- Probably your dog man thing.
- Oh.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.017
- The rabid one.

29:45.826 --> 29:47.612
Tor's dog was probably
the big one we saw

29:47.786 --> 29:49.947
that was trying to smash
the door down when you had Liam.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.411
- He probably heard Liam crying.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.913
- He was trying to protect him.
- Well, that's good, right?

29:54.084 --> 29:56.621
- No. That is not good.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.036
The rabies virus...
it attacks the brain.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.876
It makes you demented, paranoid.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.666
If he cares about Liam,
if he loves him...

30:06.805 --> 30:10.923
Dogs bury things
they're trying to protect.

30:13.937 --> 30:14.972
- Tor.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.388
Do you know where your dog
may have gone

30:17.566 --> 30:21.400
if he was trying to... hide Liam?

30:21.570 --> 30:23.606
- Oh, um... Marcoon Hills.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.570
They start right up here
behind my property.

30:25.699 --> 30:27.109
- And go for 20 miles.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.877
I've got all available units
starting from the south side.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.208
They can't have gone too far.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.831
- We've seen him run.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.375
They could've gone real far.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.965
- I'll try and get that helicopter again.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.344
- Are sure you're dressed for this?

30:53.518 --> 30:56.134
- I'm not, no.
- Why the suit?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.804
- I'm a professional, Audrey.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.020
Professionals wear suits to work.

31:00.192 --> 31:03.730
- Even in Haven?
- Especially in Haven.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.644
Look, my clients aren't normal.

31:05.781 --> 31:08.022
Anything that I can do
to help them feel normal helps.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.690
(rustling)
- I've got movement.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.576
- Me, too.

31:15.749 --> 31:17.034
(Claire): They're working like a pack!

31:32.766 --> 31:34.347
- They're not gonna let us go any farther.

31:34.518 --> 31:36.975
And I think that man is your dog, Jessie.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.100
- That's my gun.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.681
(Nathan): Is it loaded?

31:40.190 --> 31:41.475
- Yup.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.190
How does he know how to use my gun?

31:46.238 --> 31:48.024
(growls)

31:50.325 --> 31:51.906
- He saw me use mine.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.487
(growls angrily)
(Claire): Careful!

31:53.662 --> 31:55.448
Rabies makes dogs unpredictable.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.284
- It's gonna get real cold out here
the minute the sun goes down.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.164
Liam's gonna freeze.
We gotta do something.

32:00.669 --> 32:02.705
- Don't shoot him.
- Why?

32:03.171 --> 32:06.709
- I know he's just a dog,
but he belongs to my son.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.794
Don't shoot him.

32:09.386 --> 32:11.047
- I think I know what's causing Tor's
Trouble.

32:11.221 --> 32:14.179
Did you have to put him down, Tor,
or could you have gotten him a shot?

32:14.683 --> 32:16.344
- They're expensive.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.642
- He should get closer, talk to him.
- What?

32:19.813 --> 32:21.349
- He feels guilty.
He should get closer,

32:21.523 --> 32:23.730
talk and... try to connect.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.152
- To the angry, rabid man-dog with a gun?

32:28.822 --> 32:31.529
- He treated the dog like a beast,
he turned into a human.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.863
Maybe that's how it's supposed to work.
If you treated him with some humanity now...

32:35.036 --> 32:36.071
- He would...

32:36.913 --> 32:39.290
turn back into a dog.

32:42.961 --> 32:43.996
Get closer.

32:45.422 --> 32:46.628
Talk to him.

32:52.429 --> 32:55.466
(growls)

32:55.640 --> 32:56.925
- Look...

32:59.853 --> 33:00.933
Dog...

33:03.523 --> 33:05.059
Jessie...

33:06.735 --> 33:09.067
I should've tried to help you,
I should've...

33:09.237 --> 33:11.102
I should've taken care of you.

33:12.407 --> 33:15.570
But the truth is,
l was... I was jealous.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.819
Jealous of what you and Liam had.

33:19.289 --> 33:21.371
His mom left, and...

33:21.541 --> 33:23.532
he just moved straight to you.

33:25.462 --> 33:29.080
l... was just wrapped up
in so much of my own misery,

33:29.257 --> 33:33.591
ljust... I didn't...
I couldn't see my way out.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.594
l was just on the outside, you know?

33:40.101 --> 33:41.887
Trying to figure out what to do.

33:44.481 --> 33:47.018
Then I was stupid, and I'm sorry.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.148
(growling)

33:51.613 --> 33:54.605
(Claire): You're doing great, Tor.
Show him you care.

33:54.783 --> 33:55.818
- Keep going.

33:59.496 --> 34:01.032
- Look...

34:03.792 --> 34:07.705
Please, just take us to Liam.
Help us find him.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.665
(growls)

34:12.801 --> 34:14.416
- Touch him.
- What?

34:25.021 --> 34:26.397
I know...

34:30.277 --> 34:32.484
I know you love Liam.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.645
(crying)
I know.

34:35.156 --> 34:38.023
I love him too, Jessie.

34:55.969 --> 35:00.588
(dogs barking)

35:08.773 --> 35:10.024
Jessie...

35:11.693 --> 35:14.526
He's dead.
(Claire): I'm so sorry, Tor.

35:14.904 --> 35:18.442
Humans can fight off rabies
a lot longer than dogs can.

35:18.617 --> 35:22.405
- Yeah, but how do we find my son now?!
Only Jessie knew where he is!

35:25.206 --> 35:26.241
Liam!

35:29.377 --> 35:30.787
Liam!

35:32.505 --> 35:33.790
Liam!

35:34.716 --> 35:36.832
Liam!!!

35:55.945 --> 35:58.027
(barking)
(Audrey): Cookie?

35:58.657 --> 36:00.363
You got something?
(dog barks)

36:01.618 --> 36:02.858
This way.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.201
- Liam!

36:07.165 --> 36:08.496
Are you okay?

36:09.584 --> 36:10.539
Are you hurt?

36:10.710 --> 36:13.702
- No.
I don't think he wanted to hurt me.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.872
- How did you know that was gonna work?
- ljust hoped he still had

36:17.133 --> 36:19.044
his human smarts, and then with,

36:19.219 --> 36:22.461
you know, a dog nose,
he's a pretty good searcher.

36:26.518 --> 36:30.261
Hey, uh, thanks for--
- You're amazing.

36:30.438 --> 36:34.477
I am so glad I got to see what you do.
You absolutely need therapy.

36:34.651 --> 36:37.859
- Can you hear yourself when you talk?
- I'm working on that.

36:38.822 --> 36:40.312
- Listen, it's...

36:40.490 --> 36:45.154
It's just I...
I think I'm past therapy.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.785
- Nobody's past it.
- I've been trapped in a snow globe,

36:47.914 --> 36:48.949
l've fought shadows,

36:49.124 --> 36:50.489
and I've been almost killed
by machines.

36:50.667 --> 36:51.827
- Hadley's getting over
the snow globes,

36:52.001 --> 36:53.616
and Thornton...
(exhales)

36:53.753 --> 36:57.917
I hate going to that guy's house at night.
And... Louis' my Thursday.

36:58.049 --> 37:01.007
I got him into gardening instead
of machines. Killer tomatoes.

37:01.136 --> 37:04.924
Well, not, "killer", obviously.
They're delicious.

37:05.098 --> 37:07.885
I think they'd be all right
with me telling you all this.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.970
- You help the Troubled?

37:10.103 --> 37:13.015
- You're on the front lines,
I get 'em when you're done.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.765
But people like you and me,
we need therapy.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.892
We take on everybody else's crazy,

37:19.070 --> 37:21.903
and pretty soon,
we have no room left for our own.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.655
You really ought to come see me.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.908
- Can I bring my new dog?

37:27.620 --> 37:30.453
- Wait, you're gonna keep him?
- He's a good listener.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.244
l'll warm up on him
before I come to you.

37:34.127 --> 37:35.287
- Sure.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.999
But, um, there's another relationship

37:38.173 --> 37:40.255
that I would encourage you to address.

37:43.344 --> 37:45.505
- Uh, that's...

37:45.638 --> 37:48.095
that's so... that's complicated.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.633
- l have no doubt that it is,
but I also know the only reason

37:51.811 --> 37:53.767
that he allowed me
to follow you around

37:53.938 --> 37:56.190
is because he really cares about you.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.735
It doesn't hurt
to have someone to lean on.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.567
- Good job, Cookie.

38:19.798 --> 38:23.040
(bell rings, door opens)
- | see you got the paper out.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.801
- Why are you letting Crocker and Dwight
figure things out?

38:26.971 --> 38:28.552
- Because we may need them.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.888
We may need everybody.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.884
Audrey's abductor
knows about us already.

38:34.062 --> 38:37.304
- What are you talking about?
- Follow me.

38:43.196 --> 38:45.528
It's been ransacked.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.156
This must've happened a few days ago.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.192
- Who did this?

38:52.163 --> 38:54.575
- You know what makes a hole like that?

38:55.959 --> 38:57.290
- A bolt gun.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.050
(Duke): Hey.

39:08.221 --> 39:09.381
(Audrey): Hey.

39:11.558 --> 39:13.264
- A dog?
- Yeah.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.720
My dog, Cookie.
I think I'm gonna keep him.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.396
It's not against the lease, is it?

39:17.564 --> 39:18.895
'Cause I don't think technically
that we have a lease.

39:19.023 --> 39:22.060
- Audrey, it's not the lease.
I need to talk to you.

39:22.235 --> 39:23.270
- Sure.

39:24.571 --> 39:26.402
- If it were me, I'd want to know.

39:26.573 --> 39:27.858
- What?

39:28.575 --> 39:30.031
- The Hunter.

39:39.002 --> 39:40.913
When you were Lucy, and before that,

39:41.045 --> 39:42.296
when you were Sarah...

39:43.381 --> 39:47.465
the night of the Hunter meteor storm
is the night that you disappeared both times.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.007
- Where did I go?

39:52.140 --> 39:53.676
- I don't know.

39:53.808 --> 39:57.141
You just... vanished.

40:01.316 --> 40:02.977
- When's the next one?

40:03.109 --> 40:06.272
- Two months.
- Two months?!

40:07.280 --> 40:09.692
- 49 days.

40:11.117 --> 40:12.732
(sighs)

40:28.509 --> 40:30.966
- Hey.
(chuckles)

40:33.222 --> 40:34.257
Hey.

40:37.477 --> 40:40.514
So, we're still taking this guy
for a walk?

40:40.688 --> 40:43.521
(soft music)
Calling it quits

40:43.650 --> 40:45.766
You think this is easy

40:45.902 --> 40:49.861
I swear I heard you calling

40:49.989 --> 40:51.820
the jury

40:51.950 --> 40:54.817
Call it a catch

40:55.745 --> 40:56.825
(Tor laughing)

40:56.996 --> 40:59.282
- Are you sure
you can treat this dog well?

41:00.708 --> 41:02.039
Humanely?

41:04.295 --> 41:07.128
- He gave me back my son. Yeah.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.544
- Take care of them both.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.506
The palms of your hands

41:14.681 --> 41:15.670
- Thank you.

41:15.807 --> 41:20.972
I’m looking for
a soft place to land

41:22.730 --> 41:25.767
Hey, Cookie. Good dog!

41:31.781 --> 41:34.523
I call it an ace

41:34.659 --> 41:37.025
You’ve gotta believe me

41:37.161 --> 41:38.776
- Surprised you gave him up.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.332
I kind of thought you wanted a dog.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.578
- I did.

41:48.715 --> 41:51.297
And cal/in’ it love

41:52.468 --> 41:53.924
ltjust...

41:56.764 --> 41:57.799
It wouldn't work out.

41:57.932 --> 42:00.344
A soft place to land

42:00.601 --> 42:02.933
The forest floor

42:03.062 --> 42:05.644
The palms of your hands

42:05.815 --> 42:07.305
Let's go.

42:07.483 --> 42:13.353
I’m looking for
a soft place to land

42:18.953 --> 42:21.820
(engine roaring)

42:58.743 --> 43:00.699
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
