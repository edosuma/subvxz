      Our tour is stalled.      
  We need to make a statement.  

00:05.757 --> 00:07.965
       What you have there      
  is an injunction ordering you

             -What?             

00:17.268 --> 00:19.268
     The chemo drugs I took     
   destroyed my heart muscle.   

00:19.395 --> 00:22.230
       -It's irreversible.      
          -I don't know         
  what you're saying right now. 

00:22.315 --> 00:25.149
      I'm saying I'm gonna      
        end my life, Pop.       

00:27.987 --> 00:30.238
             (yawns)            
     I've been on the phone     

00:30.365 --> 00:32.031

00:32.158 --> 00:35.368

              -Pop.             

00:35.495 --> 00:38.287
       Look, we are going       
  to get you a new heart, son.  

00:38.331 --> 00:41.165
  I'd be so far down the donor  
 list because of the chemo, Pop.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.376
   -I'd never get one in time.  
             -Okay,             

00:43.461 --> 00:46.712
   then we're going to get you  
     a-an artificial heart.     

00:46.798 --> 00:48.548
 I wouldn't survive the surgery.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.049
    And even if I did, it...    

00:50.134 --> 00:52.051
        well, it prolongs       
         the inevitable.        

00:52.136 --> 00:55.888
         I will buy you         
 a brand-new heart if I have to.

00:55.974 --> 00:59.225
           I don't...           
  I'm not letting you do this.  

00:59.310 --> 01:01.510
      Do you have any idea      

01:01.563 --> 01:03.896
       what that would do       
         to your mother?        

01:07.527 --> 01:08.859

01:13.491 --> 01:15.825
           That's who           
    I'm thinking about, Pop.    

01:17.537 --> 01:20.079
      You know what happens     
 when your heart stops working? 

01:21.624 --> 01:24.792
     My kidneys, my liver...    

01:24.877 --> 01:27.086
all of my organs will shut down.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.130

01:31.467 --> 01:35.386
     I've done the research,    
  I have looked at every angle. 

01:35.471 --> 01:37.096
      This is the best way.     

01:38.224 --> 01:39.390
             Pop...             

01:39.475 --> 01:41.017
     it's the hardest thing     

01:41.102 --> 01:44.145

02:00.455 --> 02:01.495
           I need you.          

02:04.292 --> 02:05.458
           I need you.          

02:05.543 --> 02:08.002

03:58.906 --> 04:00.614
    another reason to fight.    

04:00.700 --> 04:04.160

 nothing will ever change that?

   there's been an emergency.   

04:33.357 --> 04:35.900

        go this weekend.

 Are you sure you can't just get
  somebody to cover your shift? 

04:37.570 --> 04:39.987

 I'm sure spending quality time 
        with your mother

-Why don't you shut the hell up?

08:39.020 --> 08:40.769
      I can't kill my son.      

08:40.895 --> 08:42.770
           You can't?           

08:45.401 --> 08:47.860
   Since when you so delicate?  

08:47.945 --> 08:49.945
    I was like your brother.    

08:50.031 --> 08:51.447
   And you killed me for less.  

08:51.532 --> 08:53.949
           And, hell,           
     I love the youngblood,     

08:54.035 --> 08:57.494

          -Oh, no, boy,         

09:42.333 --> 09:44.750
    the way my knee's set up,   
      I'm fine right here.

09:50.466 --> 09:53.133
     When I was in college,

        the best DJ, Ma.        

09:55.012 --> 09:56.845
 They'd play all of Pop's songs,
          and I'd skate         

09:56.931 --> 09:59.181
    right here in this rink.    
      It felt like flying.      

09:59.266 --> 10:01.558
  Yeah, I'm sure, with all them 
   pretty girls following you.  

10:01.644 --> 10:02.893

  my little Empire Black Card.

why I didn't hit your little ass

10:44.937 --> 10:47.354
      'cause you was always     
         so responsible.

         Here, sit down.        
    I'll get you some water.    

11:05.166 --> 11:06.415
Excuse me, can I get some water?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.292
             -Sure.

  -Oh, Ma, you don't have to... 

11:26.228 --> 11:29.104
           Oh, no, no.          
       Yes, I do have to.       

11:29.231 --> 11:32.107
  I robbed you of the best part 
        of your childhood       

11:32.193 --> 11:34.359
     and I never apologized.

   your mistakes anymore, Ma.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.849
           Thank you.           

14:52.935 --> 14:54.434
   Yeah, 'cause you's a bitch.  

14:54.561 --> 14:56.895
            -(groans)           
         -You heard me.         

14:57.022 --> 14:59.147
      I mean, Andre plotted     
        to kill you, man.       

14:59.233 --> 15:01.691
     Little bit to the left     
      and both legs-- gone.     

15:01.777 --> 15:03.944
 Cookie would've been done, too.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.071
         You didn't have        
    the balls to do it then,    

15:06.198 --> 15:08.156
    you damn sure don't have    
     the balls to do it now.    

15:08.200 --> 15:11.243
       But I had the balls      
    to put you in your grave.   

15:11.328 --> 15:12.577
           (chuckles)           
              Yeah.             

15:12.663 --> 15:13.995
         I'm dead, bro.         

15:14.123 --> 15:15.372
  But you didn't even do that.  

15:15.499 --> 15:17.332
     You couldn't even pull     
      the trigger yourself.     

15:17.459 --> 15:20.335
        You handed it off       
   like the sucka MC you are.   

15:20.462 --> 15:23.338
        'Cause you wasn't       
         worth it to me!        

15:23.465 --> 15:24.631
         (soft chuckle)         

15:24.758 --> 15:26.341
       But I did enjoy...       

15:26.427 --> 15:29.177
 all that extra profit I made...

15:29.263 --> 15:31.680
   from the sale of that song   
        we did together.        

15:31.765 --> 15:34.349
           (chuckles)           
      Yeah, I got off easy.     

15:35.436 --> 15:37.394
           Poor Andre.          

15:37.479 --> 15:40.439
        He's got to limp        
to the finish line on his own...

15:40.482 --> 15:42.357
    because Daddy's a coward.   

15:44.194 --> 15:45.944
            Shut up!            

15:52.286 --> 15:53.994
   Wasn't Jamal supposed to be  
        in this meeting?        

15:54.121 --> 15:55.996
   He's the one who's actually  
        on the tour, yes?       

15:56.123 --> 15:58.665
 Yes, but he's on his honeymoon 
    in the Seychelles, so...    

15:58.750 --> 16:01.251
 Yeah, that's right. You weren't
 invited to the wedding because 

16:01.336 --> 16:03.086
        nobody likes you.       
        It was gorgeous.        

16:03.172 --> 16:04.838
    Becky and I will be happy   
           to tell you          

16:04.882 --> 16:06.047
   anything you want to know.   

16:06.091 --> 16:07.466
             -Great.            
            -Mm-hmm.            

16:07.551 --> 16:08.967
     So why are we spending     
 half a million dollars a night?

16:09.011 --> 16:11.261
       On state of the art      
      sound and set design.     

16:11.346 --> 16:12.971
     -The runway fashion...     
        -KELLY: I get it.       

16:13.015 --> 16:15.599
   But is it working? I mean,   
   have we won back the fans?   

16:15.684 --> 16:17.767
          -The reviews          
     have been spectacular.     
      -BECKY: We're getting     

16:17.811 --> 16:20.061
    -so much love out there,    
           it's crazy.          
 -KELLY: That's not a surprise. 

16:20.147 --> 16:22.731
           It's free.           
   Are the fans willing to pay  

16:22.858 --> 16:24.274
     for Empire music again?    

16:24.359 --> 16:26.276
Well, we will get a better gauge
     of that once we launch     

16:26.320 --> 16:28.904
   the new and improved Empire  
 XStream at the end of the tour 

16:29.031 --> 16:31.907
 and we can see how many people 
        actually sign up.       

16:32.034 --> 16:34.159
    Pardon the interruption.    
  Uh, we got a problem, ladies. 

16:34.244 --> 16:35.785
     My check didn't clear.     
           What's up?           

16:35.871 --> 16:37.496
         -GISELLE: Easy.        
  -THIRSTY: Okay. Okay, relax.  

16:37.539 --> 16:39.456
   Relax for a second, please?  

16:39.541 --> 16:42.626
     Empire employee checks     
are bouncing all over the place.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.586
      Mine included, okay?      
      We need to fix this.      

16:44.671 --> 16:47.464
       -Come on, hothead,       
 let me get you a cup of coffee.
        -(Giselle groans)       

16:47.591 --> 16:49.299
             Great.             

16:49.384 --> 16:51.343
     Another Empire crisis.     

16:54.681 --> 16:57.390
      Hmm.<i> Sláinte mhaith.</i>      

16:57.518 --> 16:58.975
      To your good health.      

16:59.061 --> 17:01.394
       Don't tell my moms,      
   she'll kill me. (chuckles)   

17:01.480 --> 17:03.813
            Mm. Whoa.           

17:03.899 --> 17:06.023
           -(coughing)          
           -(laughing)          

17:06.068 --> 17:07.192
       Are you all right?       

17:07.319 --> 17:09.027
           -You okay?           
       -(laughing): Yeah.       

17:09.112 --> 17:10.444
              -Ooh.             
       -All right, listen.      

17:10.489 --> 17:13.698
 You wouldn't take a $100 steak 
      and swallow it whole.     

17:13.784 --> 17:15.492
     You slice it, chew slow    

17:15.577 --> 17:17.285
      and savor the juices.     

17:20.332 --> 17:22.165
              Slow.             

17:22.291 --> 17:23.875
          There you go.         

17:23.961 --> 17:25.627
            -(coughs)           
            -Better?            

17:25.753 --> 17:27.127
       -It's still nasty.       
              -Oh.              

17:27.256 --> 17:29.214
          (both laugh)          

17:29.299 --> 17:31.007
        (Quincy chuckles)       

17:31.093 --> 17:33.093
      I admire you, Quincy.     

17:33.220 --> 17:35.637
    You've been knocked down    
        harder than most.       

17:35.764 --> 17:37.222
         But you didn't         
       let it define you.       

17:37.307 --> 17:40.267
 You got up and you jumped back 
         into the ring.         

17:41.478 --> 17:42.519
       And I admire that.       

17:42.604 --> 17:43.979
     Look, man, I'm not a...    

17:44.064 --> 17:45.397
     I'm not a fighter, Dre.    

17:46.817 --> 17:48.358
        You of all people       
        should know that.

      (cell phone vibrates)     

17:52.698 --> 17:54.322
        -Oh, one second.        
       -(chuckles lightly)      

17:54.408 --> 17:56.366
            -Giselle?           
      -Andre, I'm so sorry      

17:56.451 --> 17:58.201
 to bother you, but I'm looking 
        for your parents.       

17:58.328 --> 18:00.161
     I was just with my mom.    
         Uh, she should         

18:00.247 --> 18:02.080
  be back at the office by now. 
           What's up?           

18:02.165 --> 18:04.499
        Well, she's not,        
 and employees are missing pay.

and then we proved that's a lie.

       huh, boo boo kitty?

 real snack of a money launderer

19:55.070 --> 19:57.195
        named Damon Cross       
     and then, miraculously,    

19:57.239 --> 19:59.197
     Empire has enough money    
       for the Trust Tour.

  it's a special night where we

    with non-Empire artists.    

20:47.706 --> 20:48.997
      But we have no venue.     

20:49.124 --> 20:50.999
         -No promotions.        
      -BECKY: Hold on, now.     

20:51.126 --> 20:54.002
  Social media's my hype-bitch. 
 Secondly, the Baldwin Ballroom 

20:54.045 --> 20:56.337
        owes me a favor.        
    We could really do this.    

20:56.465 --> 20:58.715
  And if we sell out, we could  
    raise close to a million.   

20:58.759 --> 21:00.592
             ANDRE:             
 That would give us what we need
       to finish the tour,      

21:00.677 --> 21:03.928
       but it won't cover       
  our overhead moving forward.  

21:04.014 --> 21:06.931
    We need to convince Patel   
 to give us a bridge loan, ASAP.

21:07.017 --> 21:08.141
      Patel's unreachable,      
          he's at YPO.

     you're not getting in.     

21:14.900 --> 21:17.233
         But if I can...        

21:17.360 --> 21:18.735
         we got a shot.         

21:20.989 --> 21:22.197
            GISELLE:

          beat cancer,          

21:22.282 --> 21:25.366
   but a miracle only happens   
       once in a lifetime.      

21:25.494 --> 21:28.995
         -Text me if any        
  of those fools call you back. 
             -On it.

22:47.325 --> 22:48.908

22:52.873 --> 22:54.664
       That's it, Dwight.       
           That's it.           

22:54.749 --> 22:57.458
    It's... Lucious now, Pop.   

22:57.544 --> 22:59.085
            Lucious?            

22:59.170 --> 23:00.503
        What type of name       
           is Lucious?          

23:00.589 --> 23:04.966
         Uh, it's, um...        
        it's complicated.       

23:05.010 --> 23:07.552
     Nah. What's complicated    

23:07.637 --> 23:09.679
             is you.            

23:09.764 --> 23:12.599
         How's your boy?        

23:12.726 --> 23:14.392
         (playing piano)        

23:20.066 --> 23:25.111
   Pop, Andre's really having   
  a hard time right now, and... 

23:25.196 --> 23:28.489
       I'm just not ready       
    to let him go, you know?    

23:28.575 --> 23:30.366
 Sometimes I'm so proud of you, 
        and other times,        

23:30.493 --> 23:32.660
       I want to stomp you      
         into next week.        

23:32.787 --> 23:35.914
           But Andre?           
      Andre you got right.      

23:41.546 --> 23:43.129
    You remember how I died?    

23:43.214 --> 23:44.547
              Hmm?              

23:44.633 --> 23:45.965
            (gunshot)           

23:49.220 --> 23:51.721
              -Hmm?             
             -I s...            

23:51.806 --> 23:53.806
         saw everything.        

23:53.934 --> 23:57.060
              Yeah.             
      I went pretty quick.      

23:58.563 --> 24:00.104
    Suppose it was different?   

24:00.231 --> 24:03.066
       Suppose I was just       
     lying there, suffering,    

24:03.151 --> 24:05.735
          dying slowly,         

24:05.862 --> 24:08.696
   and I said, "Son, help me.   

24:08.782 --> 24:11.491
     Help me end this pain."    

24:11.618 --> 24:13.284
    Could you have helped me?   

24:15.705 --> 24:17.413
   I don't need to hear this.   

24:17.499 --> 24:19.248
   You couldn't have helped me  
    'cause you were a child,    

24:19.334 --> 24:21.042
        and you loved me        
       like children love,      

24:21.127 --> 24:22.210
      believing in fairness     
          and forever.          

24:22.337 --> 24:24.087
         And even though        
     it never ends that way,    

24:24.172 --> 24:26.047
     children still believe,    

24:26.132 --> 24:28.049
     but your son needs you     
     to love him like a man.    

24:28.134 --> 24:31.427
         -I am a man...         
   -A man that knows fairness   
     and forever ain't real.    

24:33.014 --> 24:36.265
   This ain't about you being   
   a killer or a coward, son.   

24:36.351 --> 24:39.435
        You're a father.        
  And sometimes a father's love 

24:39.479 --> 24:41.562
    is expressed in the most    
       difficult of ways.       

24:41.690 --> 24:44.148
      I'm sorry I couldn't      
  teach you that before I left. 

24:44.192 --> 24:47.860
 Andre's accepted his fate like 
  the man you taught him to be. 

24:47.946 --> 24:50.029
        You can do this.

-Lucious? Yeah, he's my husband.
              -No.              

25:40.331 --> 25:43.291
  The other thug, Damon Cross.  

25:43.376 --> 25:46.961

       -Well... (laughing)      

25:47.047 --> 25:50.089
       Oh, well, come on.       
    I've been down that road    

25:50.133 --> 25:51.632
       three times before,      
      it never stopped me.      

25:51.760 --> 25:54.260
   Yeah, well, I can't help it  
        that you're a ho.       

25:54.387 --> 25:55.553
             Well...            

25:59.059 --> 26:03.478
 I don't know what you and Damon
         did in Panama,         

26:03.563 --> 26:06.064
        but you certainly       
         look cozy here.        

26:09.235 --> 26:11.360
     Does your husband know?    

26:18.620 --> 26:20.286
       He doesn't have to.      

26:25.293 --> 26:28.086
       So all I got to do       
     is roll on Damon Cross     

26:28.171 --> 26:29.837
    and all that'll go away?    

26:29.964 --> 26:31.839
  Empire's money's back in the  
   bank by the end of the day   

26:31.966 --> 26:33.633
        and your husband        
       is never the wiser.      

26:38.932 --> 26:41.474
          I'm so sorry.         

26:41.601 --> 26:44.393
     Sorry to learn that...     

26:44.521 --> 26:48.564
        ...you are using        
       taxpayers' dollars,      

26:48.650 --> 26:50.066
     money that can be used     

26:50.193 --> 26:52.401
    to catch real criminals--   

26:52.529 --> 26:56.739
   terrorists, murderers-- to   
follow around innocent citizens.

26:56.866 --> 26:58.491
            And then,           
    with no evidence at all,    

26:58.618 --> 27:01.536
     you drag me down here,     
       waste my damn time,      

27:01.663 --> 27:04.205
        and you try this        
       junior high trick,       

27:04.332 --> 27:06.541
       threatening to out       
    my platonic relationship    

27:06.668 --> 27:08.751
 with Damon Cross to my husband.
          What, so that         

27:08.837 --> 27:10.086
  I could crack under pressure  

27:10.171 --> 27:12.713
            and lie?            
           Ms. Conway,          

27:12.799 --> 27:14.298
       you want me to lie?      

27:14.384 --> 27:16.801
      And all this without      
      my attorney present.      

27:16.928 --> 27:18.094
           You a trip.          

27:18.179 --> 27:20.763
         Let me tell you        
    what makes America great.   

27:20.890 --> 27:23.266
  People like me and my family. 

27:23.351 --> 27:25.309
          You know why?         
     Because we create art,     

27:25.395 --> 27:29.063
    and art lifts people up,    
       not tear them down       

27:29.190 --> 27:32.024
  with hate, lies, and deceit.  

27:32.068 --> 27:33.693
      God don't like ugly.      

27:33.820 --> 27:36.112
   And your days are numbered.  

27:36.197 --> 27:38.489
  And with that, I'm gonna go.  

27:38.575 --> 27:40.741
   -Waste someone else's time.  
       -(knocks on table)       

27:40.827 --> 27:42.076
        You have nothing.       

27:45.832 --> 27:47.707
             (sighs)            

27:51.087 --> 27:53.254
             DAMON:             
      I knew you'd be back.     

27:53.298 --> 27:55.756
       Look, I'm not here       
       for all that, okay?      

27:55.842 --> 27:57.425
      I meant what I said.      

27:57.552 --> 27:59.760
        Yet here you are.       

27:59.846 --> 28:00.970
             (sighs)            

28:01.014 --> 28:02.889
   I'm telling you, Cookie...   

28:02.974 --> 28:05.433
     what we had is special.    

28:05.476 --> 28:07.476
    I shared things with you    
   I never shared with anyone.  

28:07.562 --> 28:08.853
          You did, too.         

28:08.897 --> 28:10.813
   Don't just throw that away   
     because you're scared.     

28:10.899 --> 28:12.481
       I love my husband.       

28:12.567 --> 28:16.110
      You fell in love with     
 your husband when you were 16. 

28:16.196 --> 28:17.361
           Everything           
     you've done since then     

28:17.405 --> 28:18.654
        has been because        
        you "loved" him.        

28:18.740 --> 28:20.823
             Cookie.            

28:20.867 --> 28:23.826
 Let me show you what it's like 
        when a grown man        

28:23.953 --> 28:25.161

28:25.246 --> 28:27.830
            (scoffs)            
             Mm-mmm.            

28:27.957 --> 28:29.957
        I want my husband       

28:30.043 --> 28:31.667
           and my boys          

28:31.794 --> 28:33.586
     and the life we built.     

28:33.630 --> 28:35.755
        And that doesn't        
       include you, Damon.      

28:37.050 --> 28:38.466
    But I'm-a do you a solid,   

28:38.593 --> 28:39.717
  because when Andre was sick,  

28:39.802 --> 28:42.220
        you held me down,       
     so I owe you for that.     

28:44.891 --> 28:47.391
     The feds are after you.    

28:47.477 --> 28:50.686
      And they are willing      
     to lie, cheat and kill     

28:50.772 --> 28:52.855
        to take you down.       

28:52.941 --> 28:55.566
       So watch your back.      

29:07.330 --> 29:08.412
       Thanks for coming.       

29:08.498 --> 29:10.831
    Why'd you want to see me?   

29:12.293 --> 29:15.002
  I need you to get me into the 
         YPO conference.        

29:15.046 --> 29:17.922
   Patel is there, and we need  
 his approval for more funding. 

29:18.007 --> 29:19.215
              YPO?              

29:20.468 --> 29:21.592
   You know those people think  

29:21.678 --> 29:23.219
I'm just the data-mining bastard

29:23.263 --> 29:26.222
       that got shoved out      
    the back door of Empire.    

29:26.307 --> 29:28.224
        Forget it, Andre,       
       it's not happening.      

29:28.309 --> 29:30.518
   Look, I know you fantasize   
       about being a Lyon.      

29:30.603 --> 29:32.728
  Oh, so you're in my head now? 

29:36.025 --> 29:37.483
       You're my brother.       

29:38.361 --> 29:40.319
   You are my older brother...  

29:41.823 --> 29:43.364
      ...and I forgive you.     

29:47.495 --> 29:50.246
 -I tried to destroy this place.
     -You can make it right.    

29:50.331 --> 29:52.707
       It's not too late.       

30:02.260 --> 30:04.176
 How much money are we talking? 

30:05.221 --> 30:06.595
            What? No.           

30:06.723 --> 30:09.181
        I-I just need you       
     to get me into the YPO.    

30:10.476 --> 30:14.061
    Kingsley, I'm not asking    
         for your mon...        

30:14.147 --> 30:16.397
It's not half what I owe Empire.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.607
    Hopefully, it's a start.    

30:28.828 --> 30:31.537
   Were you just after a check  
         the whole time?        

30:31.664 --> 30:34.206
      No, I wasn't looking      
          for a check.          

30:36.461 --> 30:38.627
  I was looking for a brother.  

30:55.855 --> 30:57.271

31:02.737 --> 31:03.694
              Okay.             

31:11.829 --> 31:13.746
    Yeah, no, I-I understand.   
              Okay.             

31:13.790 --> 31:16.165
Yeah. All right, showtime, guys.
       Here you go. Here.       

31:16.209 --> 31:17.500
     That's for you and you.    

31:17.585 --> 31:19.502
    Listen, don't come to me    
  about no outfit, no costume,  

31:19.629 --> 31:21.295
        no none of that,        
        I got you, relax.       

31:21.339 --> 31:22.963
          Keem, you on          
     in five minutes, okay?     

31:23.091 --> 31:24.757
    -You-- I've been looking    
        for you all day.        
           -MAN: What?          

31:24.842 --> 31:26.759

  and slit your throat with it. 
           -All right.          

31:29.263 --> 31:30.679
  Uh, what is going on in here? 

31:30.723 --> 31:32.681
        -Cookie is here.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.396
     I thought the accounts     
          were frozen.

    conversation at my loft.

         to help me out?
