00:20.363 --> 00:21.830
I'm back.

00:21.950 --> 00:23.168
- What's all this?
- Ugh.

00:23.288 --> 00:26.043
We're renting out rooms
in our apartment for the long weekend.

00:26.163 --> 00:28.444
We're gonna be a Bed & Breakfast.

00:28.564 --> 00:29.858
So exciting.

00:29.978 --> 00:31.143
I love Bed & Breakfast.

00:31.263 --> 00:32.908
- They're so quaint.
- Aren't they?

00:33.028 --> 00:36.465
Random strangers shedding
skin cells all over the house.

00:36.585 --> 00:38.349
Ugh, I'm against this Bed & Breakfast

00:38.469 --> 00:40.069
as much as you can be against something,

00:40.252 --> 00:42.205
and still, let it happen.

00:42.325 --> 00:43.773
Like when my ex-wife wanted to have

00:43.893 --> 00:45.916
- a three-way with out neighbour, Ray.
- Teddy, Teddy.

00:45.940 --> 00:47.660
I don't think you should
be talking about...

00:47.684 --> 00:50.534
Wait, you had a three-way with
Ray, the guy who wears the sales suit

00:50.554 --> 00:51.933
- down on the pier?
- Yeah.

00:52.342 --> 00:55.046
I mean I wasn't involved,
I just watched. But... yeah.

00:55.166 --> 00:57.515
I had a three-way in science
class yesterday.

00:57.635 --> 01:00.910
Tammy's lab partner was absent
so she joined in with me and Joey.

01:01.030 --> 01:02.862
- It was fun.
- Okay, enough.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.096
Oilies, salties,

01:05.217 --> 01:07.501
extra-expensive toilet paper...

01:07.621 --> 01:08.621
I love that soft stuff.

01:08.710 --> 01:10.630
I thought we were doing this
to make extra-money.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.227
Isn't all this eating into our profits?

01:12.347 --> 01:13.504
Don't worry, Bob.

01:13.624 --> 01:15.718
It's gonna be money and online reviews

01:15.838 --> 01:18.382
and when I die and I go
to heaven. God's gonna say

01:18.502 --> 01:21.675
"Hey, aren't you the lady
who rented the B&B I heard about?

01:21.891 --> 01:23.665
And I'm gonna say,
"Yes, God..."

01:23.785 --> 01:25.651
- "What can I get you?"
- Here, hold this.

01:28.511 --> 01:30.718
Mm, smell.

01:30.964 --> 01:32.181
Come on, smell it.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.643
You're shoving things in my nose.

01:33.763 --> 01:35.256
Smell this one now.

01:35.376 --> 01:36.459
You always do this, Lin.

01:36.579 --> 01:39.302
Whenever you entertain,
you put way too much effort into it

01:39.422 --> 01:40.477
and drive yourself crazy.

01:40.597 --> 01:41.940
What are you talking about?

01:42.060 --> 01:44.800
- I'm a wonderful hostess.
- No, Linda.

01:44.920 --> 01:45.996
You go overboard and then

01:46.116 --> 01:48.293
if people aren't appreciative enough,
you snap.

01:48.413 --> 01:49.413
That's not true.

01:49.596 --> 01:52.698
I'm a gifted hostess
and I'm ready to go pro.

01:52.818 --> 01:55.372
- It is really soft.
- Put it back on the roll, please.

01:55.492 --> 01:57.968
But, mom, what if we just put Tina
by the toilet?

01:58.088 --> 01:59.961
- Yeah.
- I don't mind.

02:01.921 --> 02:04.491
Almost check-in time.

02:04.611 --> 02:07.443
Tina, Gene, are your rooms
guest-ready?

02:07.563 --> 02:09.225
- Yeah.
- Subjective.

02:09.345 --> 02:12.139
Remember when you made fun
of me for moving into a closet?

02:12.259 --> 02:15.635
Well now you suckers have to give up
your room and I don't.

02:17.020 --> 02:18.517
A guest!

02:18.637 --> 02:21.454
Javi... is an entomologist.

02:21.574 --> 02:23.914
- Javed. My name is Javed.
- What?

02:24.034 --> 02:25.034
Alright.

02:25.153 --> 02:27.548
What kind of doctor is
an entomologist again?

02:27.668 --> 02:29.343
Glands, butt?

02:29.463 --> 02:31.229
Ha, I'm not a butt doctor.

02:31.349 --> 02:33.480
I study insects, specifically

02:33.600 --> 02:35.401
the mating habit of
the myfungal beetle.

02:35.469 --> 02:37.627
Oh. So what brings you here?

02:37.747 --> 02:39.996
Myfungal beetles feed on fungus,

02:40.116 --> 02:43.347
and this town has a very,
very high potency of fungus.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.397
Uh, that's actually
our town motto.

02:45.517 --> 02:46.746
Fungus town!

02:46.814 --> 02:48.948
Tina, why don't
you show Javeeed...

02:49.016 --> 02:50.082
His room...
Javed.

02:50.150 --> 02:51.417
Jav-ed?
Javed.

02:51.485 --> 02:54.187
You'll be in the
equestrian suite!

02:54.254 --> 02:55.922
Huh?
Okay.

02:55.989 --> 02:58.057
That's great... he
brought a bug in a jar

02:58.125 --> 02:59.325
into our house.

02:59.393 --> 03:00.893
(WHISPERS):
Don't be racist!

03:00.961 --> 03:02.461
I decorated it myself.

03:02.529 --> 03:03.563
You...

03:03.630 --> 03:06.332
Like horses a lot.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.700
You like jars.

03:07.768 --> 03:09.335
Oh, these are
specimen jars... I intend

03:09.403 --> 03:12.138
to mate the queen with a male
and preserve her eggs.

03:12.206 --> 03:14.774
You mean you're gonna watch
beetles have sex with each other?

03:14.842 --> 03:16.008
Mm-hmm.
Cool.

03:16.076 --> 03:17.276
What's that for?

03:17.344 --> 03:19.111
Ooh, this is a
synthetic pheromone.

03:19.179 --> 03:21.080
It's similar to what
the queen emits

03:21.148 --> 03:23.216
when she wants to
attract males. (SNIFFS)

03:23.283 --> 03:24.884
Does it work on human boys?

03:24.952 --> 03:25.952
Oh, no.

03:25.986 --> 03:27.086
Well, maybe.

03:27.154 --> 03:28.688
Ah...

03:28.755 --> 03:30.623
(COUGHING)

03:30.691 --> 03:32.358
May I store these
in the bathroom?

03:32.426 --> 03:33.926
Sure. Everyone
would love that.

03:33.994 --> 03:34.727
(DOORBELL RINGS)

03:34.795 --> 03:36.796
More guests!

03:36.864 --> 03:38.197
Welcome!

03:38.265 --> 03:39.632
You must be ed

03:39.700 --> 03:41.334
and Nora Samuels!

03:41.401 --> 03:42.702
Yes. Hello.
Hi. Come on, come in.

03:42.769 --> 03:43.769
I'll give you the tour.

03:43.804 --> 03:45.471
Okay, this is the salon.

03:45.539 --> 03:46.983
This is where we're gonna have
the meet-and-greet,

03:47.007 --> 03:48.307
and you're just in time!

03:48.375 --> 03:49.709
Uh... Actually, we'd just like

03:49.776 --> 03:51.376
to go to our room, if that's okay?
Right.

03:51.443 --> 03:52.643
We'd just like to get settled.

03:52.667 --> 03:53.713
(LAUGHS)
What? Why?

03:53.780 --> 03:55.381
Stay here for the
meet-and-greet.

03:55.449 --> 03:57.283
Maybe we'll come
back out in a bit.

03:57.351 --> 03:58.818
No, stay.

03:58.886 --> 04:00.086
It's gonna be fun.

04:00.153 --> 04:01.621
Tina, get Javeed!

04:01.688 --> 04:02.788
I think he's napping.

04:02.856 --> 04:03.789
Wake him up!

04:03.857 --> 04:05.958
So, let's go around

04:06.026 --> 04:07.994
and we'll, um,
we'll play a little game.

04:08.061 --> 04:11.130
Let's say what our
most embarrassing moment was.

04:11.198 --> 04:12.732
Who wants to go?

04:13.967 --> 04:14.967
I'll go.

04:15.035 --> 04:17.168
One time I coughed at communion,

04:17.237 --> 04:19.772
and the wafer flew
right out of my mouth

04:19.839 --> 04:21.841
and it landed on my boob!

04:21.909 --> 04:24.143
(LAUGHS)
Who wants to go next? Javed?

04:24.211 --> 04:25.278
I'll take a pass.

04:25.345 --> 04:27.280
Get me on the next one.

04:27.347 --> 04:29.048
What about when dad got a perm?

04:29.116 --> 04:31.250
It wasn't a perm;
It was a body wave.

04:31.318 --> 04:33.619
You looked like Barbra Streisand
in the main event.

04:33.687 --> 04:36.756
You looked like Barbra Streisand's pubes.
I did.

04:36.823 --> 04:38.943
How about how dad says gracias
in Mexican restaurants?

04:38.967 --> 04:40.593
That's embarrassing.

04:40.661 --> 04:42.228
Remember the time
you asked me to check

04:42.296 --> 04:43.763
your prostate
and you made a poopie?

04:43.830 --> 04:45.264
Linda!
Oh, remember when dad

04:45.332 --> 04:46.999
tried to go jogging?

04:47.067 --> 04:48.601
(OTHERS LAUGHING)

04:48.669 --> 04:50.202
(LAUGHTER BECOMES HYSTERICAL)

04:50.270 --> 04:51.570
Oh, come on!
What about

04:51.638 --> 04:53.873
when dad cried at
the end of about Schmidt?

04:53.941 --> 04:55.341
Gene, why are you
in your underwear?

04:55.375 --> 04:57.043
I was eating.
What, you want me

04:57.110 --> 04:58.744
to get butter
all over my clothes?

04:58.812 --> 05:01.547
Yeah. Now we just take him
out back and hose him off.

05:01.615 --> 05:03.582
You're a doctor...
is this a mole?

05:03.650 --> 05:05.584
I'm not a doctor.
And that's a raisin.

05:05.652 --> 05:08.387
Oh... edible mole.

05:08.455 --> 05:10.656
(LAUGHS) All right, let's let
someone else go.

05:10.724 --> 05:12.091
Samuels, how about you,

05:12.159 --> 05:14.460
what's your most
embarrassing moment?

05:14.528 --> 05:15.795
I don't know.

05:15.862 --> 05:17.830
This?
Yeah, definitely this.

05:17.898 --> 05:19.065
Hm.

05:19.132 --> 05:21.200
(CLEARS THROAT)
Are we done?

05:21.268 --> 05:23.569
Yes, I guess we are done, Nora.

05:23.637 --> 05:26.477
(WHISPERS): Are you sure there aren't any
rooms available anywhere else?

05:26.545 --> 05:28.465
(WHISPERS): No, everything's
booked... I checked.

05:28.489 --> 05:30.042
Ooh, hello.
(CHUCKLES) Hm.

05:30.110 --> 05:31.143
I'm cold.

05:31.211 --> 05:33.412
My nipples are so pointy!

05:33.480 --> 05:34.747
Ding-dong!
It's for you.

05:34.815 --> 05:36.282
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

05:36.350 --> 05:37.883
(SING SONGY) Mm-hmm...
Mm-mm.

05:37.951 --> 05:39.885
It might be a package...
You should answer it.

05:44.749 --> 05:48.819
(SINGING LIVELY MELODY)

05:48.886 --> 05:50.053
Yecch!

05:50.121 --> 05:51.555
Lin, stop stewing
and go to sleep.

05:51.622 --> 05:52.889
I can't help it, Bob!

05:52.957 --> 05:54.891
Our guests are
such party poopers.

05:54.959 --> 05:58.361
All of 'em! No one has
any b&b spirit at all!

05:58.429 --> 06:00.931
(GROANS) Okay, just
go to sleep, all right?

06:00.998 --> 06:02.699
You'll feel better
in the morning.

06:02.767 --> 06:03.767
Fine!

06:03.801 --> 06:05.368
Gene, gene,

06:05.436 --> 06:07.537
your foot is down the
back of my underwear.

06:07.605 --> 06:09.940
It's warm down there...
My feet are cold.

06:10.007 --> 06:11.975
Yes, but it's my ass.
Mm.

06:12.043 --> 06:13.844
Dad, are you still awake?

06:13.911 --> 06:17.214
Yes, Tina. I was just talking to Gene,
right? A second ago?

06:17.281 --> 06:19.649
Do you think horses get songs
stuck in their heads?

06:19.717 --> 06:21.084
Oh, my God.
I don't know.

06:21.152 --> 06:22.152
Tina, go to sleep.

06:22.220 --> 06:23.587
Dad, do you want any chicken?

06:23.654 --> 06:25.388
Don't tell anyone...
There's just enough

06:25.456 --> 06:27.991
for the two of us.
Just go to sleep, all of you.

06:28.059 --> 06:29.739
I'm glad our guests
are comfortable, Linda,

06:29.763 --> 06:30.694
'cause this is great!

06:30.761 --> 06:31.895
Oh! Our guests!

06:31.963 --> 06:33.296
They'll appreciate me.

06:33.364 --> 06:35.899
I'll just have to try
harder next time.

06:35.967 --> 06:37.901
(GRUNTING)
Hey!

06:37.969 --> 06:40.337
(WHISPERS):
I've got a backup.

06:40.404 --> 06:42.472
BOB: I've never been so happy
to be at work.

06:42.540 --> 06:44.060
Yeah, you opened early
today, huh, Bob?

06:44.084 --> 06:46.009
Well, there was a line
to get into the bathroom

06:46.077 --> 06:47.911
up in the apartment,
so I came down here

06:47.979 --> 06:50.347
to do my morning routine
in the slop sink.

06:50.414 --> 06:51.681
(HUMMING A TUNE)

06:53.818 --> 06:56.820
(HUMMING A TUNE)

06:56.888 --> 06:58.355
Whoo! (CHUCKLES)

06:58.422 --> 06:59.823
Whoo!

06:59.891 --> 07:01.725
Bob, do we have
any toothpicks down here?

07:01.792 --> 07:04.027
Yeah, over there.
Pretty ones?

07:04.095 --> 07:05.695
What do you mean,
pretty ones, Lin?

07:05.763 --> 07:07.130
The nice ones.

07:07.198 --> 07:08.732
How's the b&b going, Linda?

07:08.799 --> 07:10.934
Oh, it's great!
Why? What'd you hear?

07:11.002 --> 07:13.203
What? Nothing.
I bet it's magical up there.

07:13.271 --> 07:14.604
I picture it like England.

07:14.672 --> 07:16.606
It is, Teddy, it is.

07:16.674 --> 07:18.241
But do they appreciate it?

07:18.309 --> 07:20.477
Holed up in their rooms
like dirty little gophers?

07:20.544 --> 07:22.904
Why come to a b&b if you're not gonna
participate, you know?

07:22.972 --> 07:24.012
Oh, they're so ungrateful!

07:24.036 --> 07:25.749
I wish I was staying at your b&b.

07:25.816 --> 07:28.685
I'd sit in the parlour, and maybe I'd have
a little wine,

07:28.753 --> 07:30.320
play some board games...

07:30.388 --> 07:33.089
Yes! Wine! Games!

07:33.157 --> 07:35.692
Teddy, you should stay here.
What?

07:35.760 --> 07:37.440
You should. You're the dream guest.
Really?

07:37.464 --> 07:38.862
You're the one I'm looking for?

07:38.930 --> 07:39.996
Do you have any vacancies?

07:40.064 --> 07:41.965
Yes! Louise's room!

07:42.033 --> 07:44.801
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Linda, Louise's room?
She'd murder us.

07:44.869 --> 07:46.970
She's a big girl...
She'll get over it.

07:47.038 --> 07:48.749
Linda, she won't get over it...
When you vacuumed

07:48.773 --> 07:50.774
in there, she wouldn't
talk to you for a week.

07:50.841 --> 07:52.761
Plus, it's not even a room;
It's, like, a closet.

07:52.810 --> 07:55.050
That sounds perfect for me...
I don't need a lot of room.

07:55.118 --> 07:56.438
I'll just bring,
like, one outfit.

07:56.462 --> 07:58.114
Oh, I love it!
I'll get my stuff.

07:58.182 --> 07:59.215
This is gonna be great!

07:59.283 --> 08:00.550
Well, have fun telling Louise

08:00.618 --> 08:02.178
you're kicking her
out of her room, Lin.

08:02.219 --> 08:03.219
Wear a helmet.

♪ Ah, ha, ha... ♪

08:06.891 --> 08:08.425
What are you doing?

08:08.492 --> 08:10.660
Oh, hi, Louise. I was just...
Oh, hi, mom.

08:10.728 --> 08:12.562
Hello.
You're holding my stuff.

08:12.630 --> 08:13.863
Hello, my little lady.

08:13.931 --> 08:15.231
Hello, mom.

08:15.299 --> 08:16.700
What are you doing with my stuff?

08:16.767 --> 08:18.969
I was just welcoming our newest

08:19.036 --> 08:21.438
bed-and-breakfast guest
into your room.

08:21.505 --> 08:22.806
Into my room?

08:22.873 --> 08:24.708
Say hello to Teddy!

08:24.775 --> 08:25.842
(GASPS)

08:25.910 --> 08:26.810
Hi, Louise.

08:26.877 --> 08:28.378
You got wonderful stuff in here.

08:28.446 --> 08:30.413
I love, love, love it!
What?

08:30.481 --> 08:32.426
Except for this little guy; He's kind of
giving me the creeps.

08:32.450 --> 08:33.883
(QUIETLY):
This isn't happening!

08:33.951 --> 08:35.885
Mother, this isn't
happening, right?

08:35.953 --> 08:38.221
Has the world gone crazy?!

08:38.289 --> 08:40.557
(CHUCKLES) Okay,
come on, Louise.

08:40.624 --> 08:42.491
Let's leave our guest alone.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.961
You mean your guest,
'cause I did not invite Teddy

08:45.029 --> 08:46.429
to come into my room and

08:46.497 --> 08:48.365
move my stuff around!
That's right.

08:48.432 --> 08:49.532
Come on.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.800
See you in a little... bit

08:50.868 --> 08:52.502
at the wine-and-
cheese mixer, Teddy.

08:52.570 --> 08:53.770
Sounds good, Linda.

08:53.838 --> 08:55.672
And I'll see you in hell, Teddy.

08:55.740 --> 08:56.840
I'm sorry, Teddy.

08:56.907 --> 08:59.109
I will see you in hell!

08:59.176 --> 09:00.610
Where are the Samuels?

09:00.678 --> 09:02.178
The cheese is getting sweaty.

09:02.246 --> 09:03.546
They're in their room.

09:03.614 --> 09:05.382
I think they're
jumping on the bed.

09:05.449 --> 09:07.450
I heard the box
spring going crazy.

09:07.518 --> 09:09.219
Sounds like they're "busy."

09:09.286 --> 09:11.921
They should be busy eating
cheese and sipping wine.

09:11.989 --> 09:13.229
What do you mean, they're busy?

09:13.297 --> 09:14.164
Like, they got homework?

09:14.231 --> 09:15.759
No. They're... it's...

09:15.826 --> 09:18.628
Busy jumping, they can't
take a jumping break?

09:18.696 --> 09:21.598
Ah, Javay!
You came back

09:21.665 --> 09:23.333
for the wine and cheese!

09:23.401 --> 09:25.802
You got to catch up.
Chug! Chug! Chug!

09:25.870 --> 09:28.004
Whoa, look at all those males.

09:28.072 --> 09:29.806
Yes, Tina!
One of these lucky bugs

09:29.874 --> 09:33.043
will mate with the queen, and
then she will bite off his head.

09:33.110 --> 09:34.377
So romantic.

09:34.445 --> 09:35.378
Cheese?

09:35.446 --> 09:36.479
No, thank you.

09:36.547 --> 09:37.747
Eat it.
Mm-mm.

09:37.815 --> 09:39.249
Aw, have some.
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

09:39.316 --> 09:40.917
Open your mouth. Open the mouth.
Mm, mm.

09:40.985 --> 09:41.851
Just try it.
(WHIMPERS)

09:41.919 --> 09:42.952
You're gonna love it.

09:43.020 --> 09:43.853
You're gonna love it.

09:43.921 --> 09:44.921
It's really good.

Gene, you're over your limit!

09:46.991 --> 09:47.924
(CHUCKLES)
Well, I...

09:47.992 --> 09:49.459
Hate to miss wine and cheese,

09:49.527 --> 09:51.327
but it's time for
these little fellas

09:51.395 --> 09:53.463
to meet their mates.
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

09:53.531 --> 09:55.999
Bye-bye.
Wait. I want to watch.

09:56.067 --> 09:58.902
Well, I'll tell you, Linda,
I'm having the time of my life.

09:58.969 --> 10:00.837
You're not gonna hear me
whining about it.

10:00.905 --> 10:03.573
Hey, "whine."
(LAUGHING LOUDLY)

10:03.641 --> 10:06.009
(LAUGHING) Everyone should
be here for this!

10:06.077 --> 10:07.710
They don't know
what they're missing!

10:09.780 --> 10:12.415

from the... hallway.

10:12.483 --> 10:15.952
Do you like that, Louise?
Yeah. Oh, it was... Was really funny!

10:16.020 --> 10:17.787
(LAUGHTER DYING AWAY)

10:17.855 --> 10:19.823
Get out of my room.

10:19.857 --> 10:22.725
I'm your guest in your room...
Did you talk to your mommy?

10:22.793 --> 10:25.228
It's not my mommy's room; It's my room.
No, I know,

10:25.296 --> 10:28.465
and I paid $75, and I'm just
going to stay in your room

10:28.532 --> 10:29.899
for a couple of nights.
Louise,

10:29.967 --> 10:31.167
put some cheese in your mouth.

10:31.191 --> 10:32.535
Mmm.

10:32.603 --> 10:34.003
Mmm, isn't that delicious?

10:34.071 --> 10:35.839
Yeah, it really goes down easy,

10:35.906 --> 10:37.107
doesn't it, Teddy?

10:37.174 --> 10:38.408
Ow. (CHUCKLES)

10:38.476 --> 10:39.809
Just so you know, Teddy,

10:39.877 --> 10:41.811
you have one hour,
then I get real.

10:43.447 --> 10:46.516
If I were a pheromone,
where would I be?

Oh! Uh.. Good night.

11:11.575 --> 11:12.942
Crazy lady.

11:13.010 --> 11:15.378
She's a nut. Am I right?

11:15.446 --> 11:16.579
Oh, you're bad!

11:18.215 --> 11:19.516
Good night,

11:19.583 --> 11:21.251
Teddy!
Good night, Linda!

11:21.318 --> 11:23.686
Sleep tight!
Sleep tighter, Lin.

11:23.754 --> 11:25.822
Don't let the bed bugs bite!

11:25.890 --> 11:27.257
I won't.

11:27.324 --> 11:28.691
Hey, my pillow smells funny.

11:28.759 --> 11:30.527
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

11:30.594 --> 11:32.195
Good night, Samuels!

11:32.263 --> 11:35.498
Oh, woo! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
Hey!

11:35.566 --> 11:36.466
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!

11:36.534 --> 11:37.814
Could you please close the door?

Yeah. Oh, my God.
Okay. Sorry. Sorry.

Okay. All right. All right.

11:42.488 --> 11:43.740
Leave!

11:43.807 --> 11:45.842
Why is Mr. Samuels
wearing handcuffs?

11:45.910 --> 11:47.177
They are...

11:47.244 --> 11:48.711
They are escape artists.

11:48.779 --> 11:50.013
(GASPS)
They are?!

11:50.080 --> 11:51.581
Yes. Isn't that interesting?

11:51.649 --> 11:53.483
Okay, time for bed. Let's go.

11:53.551 --> 11:55.151
All right, Louise,
since you're new here,

11:55.175 --> 11:56.553
I'll show you the ropes.

11:56.620 --> 11:58.655
That corner of the
bed is for eating.

11:58.722 --> 12:00.423
This right here is
the exercise area.

12:00.491 --> 12:01.824
This is where I thrash.

Here we go.

12:18.709 --> 12:21.744
Have you talked to your mommy?

12:21.812 --> 12:23.713
Why don't you talk
to your mommy, Teddy?

12:23.781 --> 12:26.115
About your new roommates.

12:33.956 --> 12:35.290
Where is everybody?

12:35.358 --> 12:37.278
Careful, Bob. I reused
the cheese from yesterday.

12:37.326 --> 12:39.194
Some of the omelettes
have toothpicks in them.

12:39.262 --> 12:41.429
Ow. Ow. Ah.

12:41.497 --> 12:43.565
Oh, good morning, Javee!

12:43.633 --> 12:45.767
I hope you and your bugs
are hungry.

12:45.835 --> 12:48.970
My appetite is gone, along with
several of my specimen jars.

12:49.038 --> 12:51.039
They contained
my most virile males.

12:51.107 --> 12:52.541
Oh, no.

12:52.608 --> 12:53.942
Ah, little insects with wings.

12:54.010 --> 12:55.477
How far could they go?

12:55.545 --> 12:58.580
Hey, guys.
(ALL YELLING)

12:58.648 --> 13:00.215
What? Do I have bed head?

13:00.283 --> 13:01.516
Oh, good God, Teddy.

13:01.584 --> 13:03.718
My beetles!
Aah!

13:03.786 --> 13:06.888
- What?
- Teddy, you've got beetles all over your face.

13:06.956 --> 13:09.291
Is that right? I haven't
looked in the mirror yet.

13:09.358 --> 13:11.159
These males are in an
extremely amorous state.

13:11.227 --> 13:12.594
You mean, right now
they're trying

13:12.662 --> 13:14.162
to mate with Teddy's face?
JAVED: Yes.

13:14.230 --> 13:14.796
Aw.

13:14.864 --> 13:16.598
Oh, God, Ted.

13:16.666 --> 13:18.506
Does it hurt?
Nope. Nope. Don't worry about it.

13:18.574 --> 13:20.414
Teddy, you should probably get
to the hospital.

13:20.438 --> 13:21.903
You okay to drive?

13:21.971 --> 13:23.905
No, I don't need a hospital.
I'll be fine.

13:23.973 --> 13:25.707
This is still a magical weekend.

13:25.775 --> 13:27.075
Aw.
You know?

13:27.143 --> 13:28.543
He's the perfect guest.

13:28.611 --> 13:29.845
What's for breakfast?
Eggs!

13:29.912 --> 13:32.214
Ugh! Nothing gets to this guy.

13:32.281 --> 13:34.549
You! I don't know how,
but you did this.

13:34.617 --> 13:36.451
(SNIFFING)
I know how she did it.

13:36.519 --> 13:38.153
She used my pheromones on him.

13:38.221 --> 13:39.521
Okay, well, uh, Linda, everyone,

13:39.589 --> 13:41.323
have fun in the B and B.

13:41.390 --> 13:43.124
I'll be downstairs in
the restaurant. Bye.

13:43.192 --> 13:44.559
Bye, dad. Bye, dad.
No!

13:44.627 --> 13:46.728
You deal with her!
She's out of control!

13:46.796 --> 13:48.697
Okay. Uh,
give her her room back.

13:48.764 --> 13:50.165
No!
Well, that's all I got.

13:50.233 --> 13:52.467
Bye.

13:52.535 --> 13:54.102
Louise!

13:54.170 --> 13:55.804
You're grounded.
Go to your room.

13:55.872 --> 13:57.639
Gladly.
That's all I ever wanted.

13:57.707 --> 13:58.974
No, I mean my room.

13:59.041 --> 14:00.642
Go to my room.

14:00.710 --> 14:02.043
You can't make me.

14:02.111 --> 14:04.246
Oh, yes, I can, miss Missy.

14:05.114 --> 14:07.749
I guess you can.

14:07.817 --> 14:10.252
I've never seen these beetles
so aroused.

14:10.319 --> 14:11.953
I have that affect
on beetles. (LAUGHS)

14:12.021 --> 14:14.189
I haven't had this
much action in a while.

14:14.257 --> 14:15.557
Are they gonna call me tomorrow?

14:15.625 --> 14:17.425
Probably not,
right? That's okay.

14:17.493 --> 14:19.928
Teddy. Making jokes,
covered with bugs.

14:19.996 --> 14:22.464
You are a man!
Damn you!

14:22.531 --> 14:24.132
Does anything get to you?

14:24.200 --> 14:25.901
TEDDY: There's really
only one thing.

14:25.968 --> 14:28.203
GENE & TINA: Yeah?
TEDDY: Costumed characters.

14:28.271 --> 14:30.238
You know, like the ones
in amusement parks.

14:30.306 --> 14:31.640
Really?
Why?

14:31.707 --> 14:34.376
It's the eyes, gene.
Their cold, dead eyes.

14:34.443 --> 14:36.912
Watching you while
they make love to your wife.

14:36.979 --> 14:38.446
While they what?!
I mean...

14:38.514 --> 14:40.715
When they... uh...
Go to birthday parties.

14:40.783 --> 14:42.250
GENE:
All right.

14:42.318 --> 14:43.718
Thank you, Teddy.

14:43.786 --> 14:46.655
Oh, thank you, mom's purse.

14:46.722 --> 14:48.089
Well, thank you, phone.

14:48.157 --> 14:50.025
Yes, I will make a call.

14:50.092 --> 14:51.393
(WHISTLING)

14:51.460 --> 14:52.761
Oh, I gotcha.

14:52.828 --> 14:54.195
Oh, you're sizzling.

14:54.263 --> 14:55.797
I love your sound.

14:55.865 --> 14:57.705
Oh, hello. You have
costumed characters, right?

14:57.767 --> 15:00.335
Oh, that's great. Ah, I'll
take the hippo, the fox.

15:00.403 --> 15:01.736
Here's a cookie.
Here's a cookie.

15:01.804 --> 15:03.171
A baby bear.

15:03.239 --> 15:04.572
And here's a cookie.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.007
And this will be credit card.

15:06.075 --> 15:07.442
(KNOCKING)

15:07.510 --> 15:08.877
Brought you some cookies!

15:08.945 --> 15:10.245
What's going on here?

15:10.313 --> 15:11.546
Ah, we have to go home.

15:11.614 --> 15:13.548
What are you talking about?

15:13.616 --> 15:15.951
You can't leave.
You're on vacation.

15:16.018 --> 15:17.218
Sit down,

15:17.286 --> 15:18.920
enjoy the cookies,

15:18.988 --> 15:21.389
unpack your pointy bra
and your whip and whip him.

15:21.457 --> 15:23.358
He's a naughty boy.

15:23.426 --> 15:25.961
I'm a naughty boy.
Get to it!

15:26.028 --> 15:27.228
Did you just lock the door?

15:27.296 --> 15:28.797
She just locked the door.

15:28.864 --> 15:30.532
I... I don't know
what's going on.

15:30.599 --> 15:32.839
You can come out when it's time
for the ice cream social!

15:32.863 --> 15:34.235
You, too!

15:34.303 --> 15:36.404
Hey, there's my perfect guest.

15:36.472 --> 15:37.906
Hey, Linda.

15:37.974 --> 15:39.441
I got good news.

15:39.508 --> 15:41.042
I'm upgrading you

15:41.110 --> 15:44.279
to platinum status!

15:44.347 --> 15:45.780
Oh! Platinum status.

15:45.848 --> 15:47.382
That sounds fancy.

15:47.450 --> 15:48.750
It is! You hungry?

15:48.818 --> 15:51.086
You want some room service?

15:51.153 --> 15:53.355
No. Eh, I guess I can eat.

15:53.422 --> 15:54.756
I... what do you want?

15:54.824 --> 15:56.291
Uh... bacon burger?

15:56.359 --> 15:57.759
What?
Bacon burger.

15:57.827 --> 15:59.094
Bacon...
First-first word.

15:59.161 --> 16:00.462
Bacon.
One syllable.

16:00.529 --> 16:02.130
No. Two syllables.
Two syllables.

16:02.198 --> 16:04.165
Oink, oink, oink, oink,
oink, oink, oink, oink!

16:04.233 --> 16:05.633
A... pig.

16:05.701 --> 16:07.035
Dinosaur.

16:07.103 --> 16:08.570
Bacon burger.
Kevin bacon.

16:08.637 --> 16:09.938
Second word.

16:10.006 --> 16:11.239
Break pads?

16:11.307 --> 16:12.707
Dinosaur.

16:12.775 --> 16:14.142
Jurassic park!

16:14.210 --> 16:15.510
(MOOING)
Charades!

16:15.578 --> 16:16.911
You can't guess charades.

16:16.979 --> 16:18.446
Yes, you can.

16:18.514 --> 16:19.881
Oh. Is it charades?
(MOOING)

16:19.949 --> 16:21.282
Cow. Burger!
Burger.

16:21.350 --> 16:22.784

All right.

16:22.852 --> 16:24.052

Yes. Bacon burger!

16:24.120 --> 16:25.787
All right.
I can do that.

16:25.855 --> 16:27.535
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Uh, doorbell. I'll get it.

16:27.590 --> 16:29.324
Oh, footloose.

16:29.392 --> 16:31.760
Can I... can I help you?

16:31.827 --> 16:33.595
Is there a Teddy here?

16:33.662 --> 16:36.064
Teddy, you've got visitors.

16:36.132 --> 16:38.366
Oh, thank you.

16:38.434 --> 16:41.069
We're the fuzzy buddies!
Are you Teddy?

16:41.137 --> 16:43.338
(GASPING)
What's going on here?!

16:43.406 --> 16:44.672
(YELLING)

16:47.743 --> 16:50.879
No! Someone's excited to
see the fuzzy buddies.

16:50.946 --> 16:52.480
(YELLING)

16:52.548 --> 16:53.982
(GRUNTING) Don't...
What?

16:54.050 --> 16:56.418
Whoa. You're a big Bo... oh!

16:59.355 --> 17:00.722
(TEDDY GRUNTING)

17:00.790 --> 17:02.724
Oh, my God!

17:02.792 --> 17:05.292
Teddy.

17:05.361 --> 17:07.362
(TEDDY CRYING)

17:07.430 --> 17:08.963
(CRYING)

17:09.031 --> 17:10.365
It's almost

17:10.433 --> 17:12.267
the ice cream social.

17:12.334 --> 17:14.002
Linda, what is going on up here?

17:14.069 --> 17:15.970
You're losing control
of your B and B.

17:16.038 --> 17:17.472
What are you talking about?

17:17.540 --> 17:19.840
Everything is going perfectly.

17:19.909 --> 17:21.643
Right. Right, Lin,
everything's fine.

17:21.710 --> 17:23.545
Bob, do you have my bacon burger?

17:23.612 --> 17:25.180
Oh, yeah,
the bacon burger. Here.

17:25.247 --> 17:26.614
Oh.

17:26.682 --> 17:28.016
Bob, can you help me?

17:28.084 --> 17:29.584
I can't chew.

17:29.652 --> 17:31.386
You need me to feed you?
Yeah.

17:31.454 --> 17:33.688
Chew it up for him,
like a mama bird.

17:33.756 --> 17:35.490
Linda, no!
He's platinum status!

17:35.558 --> 17:37.358
You're crazy, Linda!

17:37.426 --> 17:39.961
It's all right, guys. I got it.
Perfect guest.

17:43.967 --> 17:45.668
So let me get this straight.

17:45.736 --> 17:47.670
Teddy beat up a bunch
of giant animals.

17:47.738 --> 17:49.572
You locked Louise in our room,

17:49.640 --> 17:52.108
and then you locked the guests
in their rooms?

17:52.176 --> 17:54.844
They were gonna leave before the
big ice cream social at 3:00.

17:54.912 --> 17:56.879
Lin, just give me
the key, all right?

17:56.947 --> 17:58.347
I'm gonna let them out.
No.

17:58.415 --> 17:59.682
Yes.
No.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.050
Look at yourself.

18:01.118 --> 18:02.485
Look at what you've turned into!

18:03.654 --> 18:05.421
Oh, all right.

18:05.489 --> 18:08.791
All I wanted was a charming
bed and breakfast, that's all.

18:08.859 --> 18:12.228
Now what am I gonna say
to God when I go to heaven?

18:12.296 --> 18:14.530
Uh. (GASPS) Uh-oh.

18:14.598 --> 18:16.065
I lost the key!

18:16.133 --> 18:18.534
Oh, my God, what have I done?

18:18.602 --> 18:20.536
All right, all right, listen.

18:20.604 --> 18:22.438
You know Louise picks locks.

18:22.506 --> 18:23.840
Louise hates me.

18:23.907 --> 18:26.275
No, she doesn't hate you, Lin.

18:26.343 --> 18:29.378
- I'm sure she's broken out of our room already.
- Oh.

18:30.881 --> 18:32.515
I'm gonna go deal with Teddy.

18:32.583 --> 18:33.950
Why don't you try her room?

18:34.017 --> 18:35.485
Okay.

18:36.854 --> 18:39.555
Hi, honey. It's mommy.

18:39.623 --> 18:41.724
Oh, hello, mother.

18:41.792 --> 18:43.426
Please do come in.

18:43.494 --> 18:45.928
Louise, I'm sorry
I rented your room to Teddy

18:45.996 --> 18:47.763
and then locked you
in our bedroom.

18:47.831 --> 18:49.332
I accept your apology, mom.

18:49.399 --> 18:51.434
Who among us hasn't gone
a little overboard

18:51.502 --> 18:53.736
from time to time?

18:53.804 --> 18:55.838
Aw, thanks, sweetie.

18:55.906 --> 18:57.940
And you're gonna
apologise to Teddy.

18:58.008 --> 18:59.342
Okay.

18:59.409 --> 19:01.677
And there's something else
I need from you.

19:01.745 --> 19:03.880
(SIGHS) I would just cut
it up right now.

19:03.947 --> 19:05.681
Oh. No, not that.

19:05.749 --> 19:07.650
Will you please help me get Javed

19:07.718 --> 19:09.719
and the Samuels
out of their rooms?

19:09.786 --> 19:12.722
I locked them in and I...
I kind of lost the key.

19:12.789 --> 19:15.258
There might be
something I can do.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.528
LINDA:
Javed,

19:18.595 --> 19:19.995
I'm sorry I locked
you in your room.

19:20.019 --> 19:21.364
You're free to go

19:21.431 --> 19:23.666
if you wish.
You locked me in my room?

19:23.734 --> 19:26.769
No.
She's completely bonkers, isn't she?

19:26.837 --> 19:28.704
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

19:30.741 --> 19:32.275
They're gone.

19:32.342 --> 19:34.477
How did they get out
of a locked room?

19:34.545 --> 19:36.712
It was their greatest escape.

19:39.550 --> 19:40.816
Look what they left behind.

19:40.884 --> 19:42.151
Look. My tongue
is trapped.

19:42.219 --> 19:43.653
Now it's escaped.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.080
Now it's trapped.
Now it's escaped.

19:45.104 --> 19:46.389
Hey, look!

19:46.456 --> 19:47.957
They're still climbing down.

19:48.025 --> 19:49.525
You two all right?

19:49.593 --> 19:51.127
You need any help with your bags?

19:51.194 --> 19:52.662
No. Uh, actually we're stuck.

19:52.729 --> 19:54.230
Please help us.

19:54.298 --> 19:55.998
I suppose we could get a ladder.

19:56.066 --> 19:58.067
How much did you like my B and B?

19:58.135 --> 20:00.703
- A lot.
- Are you gonna recommend us to your friends?

20:00.771 --> 20:03.072
- Yes!
- Are you gonna leave me your e-mail address?

20:03.140 --> 20:04.640
ED & NORA:
Yes!

20:04.708 --> 20:06.342
Get 'em the ladder.

20:06.410 --> 20:08.844
Uh, thanks for
coming. Sorry.

20:08.912 --> 20:10.379
Sorry again.

20:10.447 --> 20:11.927
Ah, here's something
for your trouble.

20:11.951 --> 20:13.282
Two dollars.
Thanks a lot.

20:13.350 --> 20:15.184
I don't know what to
tip in this situation.

20:15.252 --> 20:16.719
Yeah. Not two dollars.

20:16.787 --> 20:18.220
Oh, hey, Teddy.
Ah, you all right?

20:18.288 --> 20:20.089
I think
I worked through my issues, Bob.

20:20.157 --> 20:22.425
Me and the owl
!Re gonna go get a drink.

20:22.492 --> 20:24.226
I'm pretty sure
there's a woman inside.

20:24.294 --> 20:25.661
That's a guy, Teddy.

20:25.729 --> 20:27.029
Oh, that's a woman.

20:27.097 --> 20:28.564
The owl was a guy.

20:28.632 --> 20:30.366
It's a woman.
The fox was a girl.

20:30.434 --> 20:31.867
Oh. Did the fox
leave already?

20:31.935 --> 20:33.269
Yes.
Oh.

20:33.337 --> 20:35.705
Linda, you are
a delightful hostess.

20:35.772 --> 20:37.607
Aw, thanks, Teddy!

20:37.674 --> 20:39.041
See you at lunch, Bob.

20:39.109 --> 20:40.443
Well, that was all right.

20:40.510 --> 20:41.944
It was pretty good.

20:42.012 --> 20:43.412
I give us a B.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.014
(GROANS)
B plus.

20:45.082 --> 20:46.616
(GROANS) A B and B plus!

20:46.683 --> 20:48.184
(CHUCKLES) My face is sweaty.

20:48.251 --> 20:49.819
Gene, take that off.

20:49.886 --> 20:51.854
Never! Oh!

20:51.922 --> 20:54.156
(GROANING)

21:00.297 --> 21:06.669
