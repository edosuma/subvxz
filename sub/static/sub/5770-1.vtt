WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:03.742
[Mindy]
YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW
YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO TURN OUT.

00:03.786 --> 00:05.657
WHEN I WAS A KID, ALL I DID
WAS WATCH ROMANTIC COMEDIES

00:05.701 --> 00:08.008
IN OUR LIVING ROOM
WHILE I DID MY HOMEWORK.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.401
[along with TV]
"I'LL HAVE WHAT SHE'S HAVING."

00:10.445 --> 00:12.403
SOME COFFEE OR,
YOU KNOW, DRINKS?

00:12.447 --> 00:13.448
[Mindy]
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

00:13.491 --> 00:15.058
TOM HANKS
WAS MY FIRST BOYFRIEND.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.408
"FOR AS LONG AS
WE BOTH SHALL LIVE."

00:17.452 --> 00:19.976
[Mindy]
IN COLLEGE,
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.761
NO SUPERVISION,
TOTAL FREEDOM.

00:22.805 --> 00:27.244
I COULD WATCH ROMANTIC COMEDIES
WHENEVER I WANTED TO.

00:27.288 --> 00:28.680
"I'M JUST A GIRL

00:28.724 --> 00:31.292
"STANDING IN FRONT
OF A BOY

00:31.335 --> 00:33.946
ASKING HIM TO LOVE HER."

00:33.990 --> 00:35.339
[Mindy]
AND THEN TWO YEARS AGO,

00:35.383 --> 00:37.341
WHEN I FINALLY
BECAME A DOCTOR,

00:37.385 --> 00:40.692
I HAD NO TIME
FOR ANY DISTRACTIONS.

00:40.736 --> 00:42.216
YOU ARE 8 1/2 MONTHS PREGNANT.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.827
YOUR HUSBAND'S GOTTA KEEP
HIS SCHVANTZ AWAY FROM YOU.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.089
WHICH I CAN IMAGINE
MUST BE DIFFICULT

00:46.133 --> 00:49.745
WITH A WIFE
AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOURS.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.442
SHE'S ALREADY PREGNANT,
DR. REED.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.227
IDIOT.

00:53.270 --> 00:56.752
I AM GOING TO PUT
DR. CASTELLANO IN CHARGE.

00:56.795 --> 00:58.232
HE'S MY BEST RESIDENT.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.538
DR. CASTELLANO.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.149
DANIEL CASTELLANO.

01:02.192 --> 01:04.151
I'M THE MAN THAT'S GONNA
TAKE A PERSON OUTTA YOU.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.457
I DON'T TAKE THAT
RESPONSIBILITY LIGHTLY, OKAY?

01:06.501 --> 01:07.850
[Shulman]
YOU'RE SCARING THEM, DANNY.

01:07.893 --> 01:08.981
[Danny]
SORRY.
SORRY, MA'AM.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.548
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED.

01:10.592 --> 01:12.594
[romantic music]

01:12.637 --> 01:15.814
[Mindy]
AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW HIM.

01:15.858 --> 01:18.252
[chuckles]

01:18.295 --> 01:21.385
OH, MY GOD.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.473
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.040
SORRY.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.998
SORRY.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.826
NO WAY.
THANKS.

01:27.870 --> 01:28.827
IT'S HAPPENING.

01:28.871 --> 01:30.002
WHAT?

01:30.046 --> 01:31.395
UM, IT'S, UH,
IT'S HAPPENING.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.267
THE DOORS ARE CLOSING.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.965
I JUST LOVE WHEN THE ELEVATORS
START TO DO THEIR THING.

01:36.008 --> 01:36.966
OH.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.228
NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

01:38.272 --> 01:39.664
I GUESS I DO TOO.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.405
OH, MY GOD.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.624
SORRY.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.495
OH, HERE, LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THAT STUFF.

01:44.539 --> 01:45.496
SORRY.
OH.

01:45.540 --> 01:46.584
[both chuckle]

01:46.628 --> 01:47.803
KLUTZES, PARTY OF TWO.

01:47.846 --> 01:49.109
SERIOUSLY.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.501
[Mindy]
MET IN AN ELEVATOR.

01:50.545 --> 01:51.676
MY HAIR CAME UNDONE.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.808
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

01:52.851 --> 01:54.375
I'M BASICALLY
SANDRA BULLOCK.

01:54.418 --> 01:57.378
AND THEN IT HAPPENED.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.031
DID THE ELEVATOR JUST STOP?

01:59.075 --> 02:00.685
I'M MINDY.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.470
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY.

02:02.513 --> 02:05.386
TOM.
ORAL SURGERY.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.346
CAN I GET YOU AN ORANGE?

02:09.390 --> 02:10.652
[Mindy]
WE WERE STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR
FOR 20 MINUTES...

02:10.695 --> 02:12.219
I HAVE A SANDWICH HERE.

02:12.262 --> 02:15.396
[Mindy]
AND I MOVED INTO HIS APARTMENT
TWO MONTHS LATER.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.527
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO

02:16.571 --> 02:17.789
WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF YOUR ARREST?

02:17.833 --> 02:19.182
I AM GETTING TO THAT.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.750
TOM GOT MARRIED LAST NIGHT
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.099
[Mindy]
THREE MONTHS AGO,

02:23.143 --> 02:25.362
HE MET AND FELL IN LOVE
WITH SOME SERBIAN GIRL

02:25.406 --> 02:28.148
WHO SELLS BAGELS
IN THE LOBBY OF THE HOSPITAL.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.498
HE FIXED HER TEETH,
DUMPED ME,

02:30.541 --> 02:32.456
AND LAST NIGHT,
THEY GOT MARRIED.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.502
I DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT
I WOULD EVER GO,

02:34.545 --> 02:36.504
SO THEY INVITED ME
TO BE POLITE.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.201
BUT, OH, I DID GO.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.160
AND AFTER FOUR VODKA SODAS,

02:40.203 --> 02:42.814
I REALIZED
I HAD SOMETHING TO SAY.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.207
SOME OF YOU
MIGHT NOT KNOW

02:44.251 --> 02:46.296
THAT TOM AND I
USED TO DATE.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.863
SO I HAVE
SOME PRETTY GOOD STORIES

02:47.906 --> 02:51.345
ABOUT EVERYONE'S FAVORITE
GLORIFIED DENTIST.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.042
[laughter]

02:53.085 --> 02:56.088
LIKE HOW TOM WILL ALWAYS
COVER HIS EARS AND GO, "AHH,"

02:56.132 --> 02:58.134
IF YOU START TALKING
ABOUT AN EPISODE OF TV

02:58.178 --> 02:59.527
THAT HE HAS NOT SEEN YET.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.268
GOD FORBID

03:01.311 --> 03:03.574
YOU GIVE AWAY THE ENDING
TO DOWNTON ABBEY.

03:03.618 --> 03:04.793
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS SHOW,

03:04.836 --> 03:06.098
AND WHY DOES EVERYBODY
KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT?

03:06.142 --> 03:07.099
SHH.

03:07.143 --> 03:08.100
WHY CAN'T I TALK?

03:09.798 --> 03:10.755
UM, WHEN WE WERE HAVING SEX

03:10.799 --> 03:13.193
THAT HE WANTED TO MARRY ME

03:13.236 --> 03:15.630
AND MAKE ME PREGNANT
WITH SIX BABIES.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.719
DID YOU GUYS KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

03:17.762 --> 03:19.547
WHICH I REALLY WANTED TOO.

03:19.590 --> 03:20.765
HEY--

03:20.809 --> 03:22.114
BUT THAT DIDN'T
END UP HAPPENING

03:22.158 --> 03:23.551
'CAUSE I THINK
I WAS TOO OLD.

03:23.594 --> 03:25.074
NO, I MEAN, I KNOW THAT
I WAS TOO OLD.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.510
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID TO ME.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.164
NOT WHAT I SAID.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.383
WHEN YOU BROKE UP WITH ME.

03:29.426 --> 03:30.775
SORRY, YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO BUILD A FUTURE

03:30.819 --> 03:32.821
WITH SOMEONE
WITH MORE YEARS TO SHARE.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.344
THAT IS WHAT I SAID.

03:34.388 --> 03:35.476
DOESN'T MATTER,

03:35.519 --> 03:37.173
BECAUSE HERE YOU ARE,
GETTING MARRIED

03:37.217 --> 03:38.827
TO THE SERBIAN BAGEL GIRL.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.089
BY THE WAY,
ARE WE 100% SURE

03:40.132 --> 03:41.917
THAT SHE IS
NOT A WAR CRIMINAL?

03:41.960 --> 03:43.179
DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.398
AM I THE ONLY PERSON HERE

03:44.441 --> 03:45.486
WHO SAW
ANGELINA JOLIE'S MOVIE?

03:45.529 --> 03:46.661
SHE'S NOT A WAR CRIMINAL.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.750
WHATEVER, YOU GUYS.
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

03:48.793 --> 03:50.534
I ONLY WANT THE BEST
FOR THE TWO OF YOU.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.362
ONE OF YOU.LET'S WRAP IT UP.

03:52.406 --> 03:53.494

03:53.537 --> 03:54.886

GREAT TALKING TO YOU.

03:55.974 --> 03:56.932
GREAT, AWESOME.
THANK YOU.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.760
BRILLIANT.

03:59.891 --> 04:02.807
I'M SANDRA BULLOCK!

04:02.851 --> 04:04.635
[upbeat techno music]

04:04.679 --> 04:05.854
[horn honks]

04:05.897 --> 04:07.072
RACIST!

04:07.116 --> 04:09.640
OOH, A SHORTCUT.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.687
AAH!

04:15.951 --> 04:19.476
MINDY.
MINDY, DOWN HERE.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.261
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

04:24.002 --> 04:26.744
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING,
GIRL TO GIRL?

04:28.093 --> 04:30.966
YOU ARE ACTING
LIKE A [bleep] IDIOT.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.621
IF YOU DON'T
PULL IT TOGETHER,

04:33.664 --> 04:35.710
NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE YOU.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.843
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE ADVICE
FROM SOME STUPID DOLL I JUST
MET!

04:38.887 --> 04:41.629
AT LEAST I HAVE
A BOYFRIEND.

04:41.672 --> 04:43.631
[Mindy]
AND WHEN THAT HOT, MEAN DOLL

04:43.674 --> 04:46.808
POINTED OUT
THAT EVEN SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND,

04:46.851 --> 04:49.463
I JUST STARTED TO CRY.

04:49.506 --> 04:52.292
THIS IS NOT
WHERE I SHOULD BE.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.257
IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO KNOW

05:01.301 --> 05:03.172
THAT THIS IS NOT REALLY
WHO I AM.

05:03.215 --> 05:07.002
OR WHO I HAVE BEEN
IS NOT WHO I'M GOING TO BE.

05:07.045 --> 05:10.092
WE HAVE YOU DOWN FOR THREE
COUNTS OF PUBLIC INTOXICATION,

05:10.135 --> 05:12.224
THEFT,
AND DISORDERLY CONDUCT.

05:12.268 --> 05:13.661
I'M SORRY,
DISORDERLY CONDUCT?

05:13.704 --> 05:15.227
AREN'T THERE RAPISTS
AND MURDERERS OUT THERE?

05:15.271 --> 05:16.490
WHEN YOU ARE DISORDERLY,

05:16.533 --> 05:19.014
YOU ARE A RAPIST
OF PEACE AND QUIET.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.929
THAT'S A LITTLE--OKAY.

05:20.972 --> 05:21.930
SHE'S BEEN BAILED OUT.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.323
GWEN, MY HERO.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.585
IT HAS BEEN GREAT

05:24.628 --> 05:26.238
WORKING WITH YOU

05:26.282 --> 05:28.415
AND SEEING THIS PROCESS
FROM THE INSIDE.

05:28.458 --> 05:29.677
BEFORE I LEAVE,

05:29.720 --> 05:32.375
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE
TO GET A TOUR

05:32.419 --> 05:33.507
OF THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT?

05:33.550 --> 05:35.422
[clears throat]
NO?
OKAY, BYE.

05:36.597 --> 05:37.859
[Gwen]
DID YOU THINK THAT TOM

05:37.902 --> 05:39.164
WAS JUST GONNA
DITCH THE WEDDING

05:39.208 --> 05:40.296
AND RUN OFF WITH YOU
LIKE YOU'RE KATHERINE HEIGL?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.776
KIND OF, YES.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.299
WELL, YOUR LIFE IS NOT
A ROMANTIC COMEDY.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.301
RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS MORE LIKE
A SAD DOCUMENTARY

05:45.345 --> 05:46.694
ABOUT A CRIMINALLY
INSANE SPINSTER.

05:46.737 --> 05:48.348
IT KINDA SOUNDS LIKE I COULD
WIN AN OSCAR THOUGH.

05:48.391 --> 05:49.914
I THINK I SHOULD CANCEL
THAT DATE TONIGHT WITH DENNIS.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.263
GWEN, NO.

05:51.307 --> 05:52.743
LISTEN, I'M JUST
BEING REAL WITH YOU.

05:52.787 --> 05:54.963
CARL AND I KNOW, LIKE,
THREE DATABLE GUYS

05:55.006 --> 05:56.007
THAT WE CAN SET FRIENDS UP WITH,

05:56.051 --> 05:57.139
AND I CAN'T SQUANDER THEM

05:57.182 --> 05:59.446
ON A HIGH-RISK SITUATION
LIKE THIS.

05:59.489 --> 06:00.621
OKAY, I PROMISE YOU, GWEN,

06:00.664 --> 06:01.970
THIS DRUNK,
CRIME-COMMITTING PERSON,

06:02.013 --> 06:03.363
SHE'S HISTORY.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.452
THERE'S NO REASON FOR ME
TO LIVE MY LIFE LIKE THIS.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.976
I WENT TO A GOOD COLLEGE,
I AM A DOCTOR.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.238
THIS IS BORING.

06:09.281 --> 06:10.935
MY BODY MASS INDEX
IS NOT GREAT,

06:10.979 --> 06:12.937
BUT I'M NOT, LIKE, PRECIOUS
OR ANYTHING, YOU KNOW?

06:12.981 --> 06:14.417
THIS IS BORING.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.201
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU ARE BORING.
CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING.

06:16.245 --> 06:17.551
DON'T CALL
MY DAUGHTER BORING.

06:17.594 --> 06:18.552
HONEY, YOU'RE FASCINATING.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.380
HMM.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.424
LISTEN, GWEN,

06:21.468 --> 06:22.730
I CANNOT KEEP HOOKING UP
WITH JEREMY

06:22.773 --> 06:23.948
AND THEN LATER ASKING HIM,

06:23.992 --> 06:25.210
"HEY, WHAT'S OUR DEAL ANYWAY?"

06:25.254 --> 06:26.734
THAT BRITISH GUY,
HE IS BAD NEWS.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.170
WE DO NOT KNOW
THAT HE IS BAD NEWS.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.693
I THINK HE HAS A GOOD HEART.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.608
I THINK HE'S HUGH GRANT IN
ABOUT A BOY.

06:31.652 --> 06:34.306
I THINK THAT HE IS HUGH GRANT
IN REAL LIFE.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.307
MINDY?

06:35.351 --> 06:36.744
I HATE TO INTERRUPT

07:12.780 --> 07:15.173
SORRY, DANNY, I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO GET DOLLED UP FOR YOU

07:15.217 --> 07:17.001
BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF BUSY
FREEING MYSELF

07:17.045 --> 07:18.612
FROM WRONGFUL IMPRISONMENT.WRONGFUL?

07:18.655 --> 07:19.874
MY GOD, YOU THINK THEY'LL
EVER CATCH THE REAL DRUNK GIRL

07:19.917 --> 07:22.224
WHO FELL INTO THE POOL?THAT'S HILARIOUS.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.530
BUT I GUESS
IT'S NOT HILARIOUS

07:23.573 --> 07:24.835
WHEN YOU GET
ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT

07:24.879 --> 07:25.967
AT A BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN
CONCERT.

07:26.010 --> 07:27.577
FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S A SPRINGSTEEN SHOW,

07:27.621 --> 07:28.970
