on <i>Californication...</i>

00:02.547 --> 00:04.239
I have a wonderful idea.

00:04.397 --> 00:08.801
I give you one of daddy's
long, slow tongue baths.

00:08.835 --> 00:10.736
Hey, I want you
to meet Gabriel.

00:10.770 --> 00:11.904
Oh.

00:11.938 --> 00:13.906
You were getting sucked off
by your sponsor.

00:13.940 --> 00:17.143
The penis is not only
a disgusting appendage,

00:17.176 --> 00:19.344
it is also a deadly weapon.

00:19.379 --> 00:20.880
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

00:20.913 --> 00:23.315
He was my best friend,
a childhood mate.

00:24.984 --> 00:27.119
I'm sorry I was such a bitch.

00:27.153 --> 00:30.689
God, I'm so sorry
I fucked your husband.

00:30.723 --> 00:32.991
Do you know that fucker?

00:33.026 --> 00:35.461
This fucker is supposed
to be in rehab right now.

00:35.495 --> 00:36.662
Did you sign Robbie Mac?

00:36.729 --> 00:38.997
Yeah, I-I wasn't sure
if it was gonna stick.

00:39.032 --> 00:42.201
Well, it stuck all right.
It's on <i>Deadline.</i>

00:42.235 --> 00:43.236
Oh, he's no 'mo.

00:43.269 --> 00:44.336
No, he's just pretending.

00:44.370 --> 00:45.571
He wanted to sign
the Mac Attack.

00:45.605 --> 00:47.740
There's a party
in your mouth tonight,

00:47.774 --> 00:48.875
and I'm coming.

00:48.908 --> 00:51.010
I can't!

00:52.712 --> 00:54.914
I'm not exactly sure how
I feel about you in general.

00:54.947 --> 00:57.316
You know,
you did fire me.

00:57.350 --> 00:58.417
Should we assume
the deal is off?

00:58.451 --> 00:59.618
Fuck you, Hank.

00:59.652 --> 01:01.253
I'm going off
to write something.

01:01.287 --> 01:02.421
You're gonna write something?

01:02.455 --> 01:03.656
- I don't know what it is.
- Really?

01:03.690 --> 01:06.159
Interesting.

Hi, woman.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.695
Where you going?

I have a meeting.

02:10.454 --> 02:12.956
Oh, you want
to grab some coffee?

02:12.990 --> 02:14.458
Well, I have a meeting.

02:14.492 --> 02:17.428
Well, can't you be late?

02:17.461 --> 02:20.230
- I have a meeting.
- I don't understand.

02:20.264 --> 02:22.799
Okay, so some people,
they have to work for a living.

02:22.833 --> 02:25.068
Oh, when I works,
I works hard.

02:25.102 --> 02:26.303
Well, get to it, then.

02:26.337 --> 02:28.706
Well, I need a muse, you know.
Where you going?

02:28.739 --> 02:31.208
I can drive you,
and we can talk on the way.

02:31.242 --> 02:33.410
- Atticus Fetch's house.
- Mm.

02:33.444 --> 02:35.446
Hmm, I think
you've been there.

02:35.479 --> 02:36.713
I have.
It's all a bit blurry, though.

02:36.747 --> 02:37.748
Mm, I can imagine.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.617
Hey, why'd you blow him off?

02:39.650 --> 02:40.717
'Cause I didn't want

02:40.751 --> 02:42.786
to write a fucking
Broadway musical, Karen.

02:42.820 --> 02:44.154
The guy seems like a nutter,

02:44.221 --> 02:46.890
and I think he might threaten
my sobriety.

02:46.924 --> 02:49.593
Says the guy with whiskey
on his breath.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.495
That was
a creative lubricant,

02:51.529 --> 02:53.197
and it's not working so well.

02:53.230 --> 02:55.699
No, so don't do--
I got to go.

02:55.733 --> 02:57.701
So you're refusing
to be my muse?

02:57.735 --> 02:59.236
Oh, sweetie.

02:59.270 --> 03:00.471
I'm gonna remember this

03:00.504 --> 03:01.938
when you need something from me,
all right?

03:01.972 --> 03:03.206
When I need something
from you?

03:03.240 --> 03:06.876
- Should that day arrive.
- Yeah.

03:06.911 --> 03:08.345
I don't like you working.

03:08.379 --> 03:10.247
You're kind of--
you're kind of curt and brusque,

03:10.281 --> 03:12.549
and, you know,
you're always on the go.

Ken. Jesus!

04:09.540 --> 04:12.042
I didn't even see you there.

04:12.076 --> 04:14.078
You--you scared the shit
out of me.

04:14.111 --> 04:15.779
- Sorry, Charlie.
- Whew.

04:15.813 --> 04:17.781
Didn't want to scare you,
never want to scare you.

04:17.815 --> 04:20.517
I appreciate that.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.686
- What's going on this morning?
- Not too much--

04:22.720 --> 04:26.323
just another day
of living the dream.

04:26.357 --> 04:28.258
How was the party last night?

04:28.292 --> 04:31.228
Ah, well...

04:31.262 --> 04:33.130
Guys in black leather,

04:33.163 --> 04:35.331
smell of moist ass hair...

04:35.366 --> 04:38.602
What's not to like?

04:38.636 --> 04:44.541
Ken, I think I feel your penis
in the small of my back.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.544
Think of it as a loaded gun
pointed at your head.

04:47.578 --> 04:51.582
Do I have to?

04:51.615 --> 04:54.784
Are you gay, Charlie?

04:54.818 --> 04:58.321
No.
No, I'm not.

04:58.355 --> 05:00.357
And I'm sorry I lied, Ken.

05:00.391 --> 05:02.760
But I'm a good agent.

05:02.793 --> 05:05.762
Get up.

05:08.565 --> 05:10.967
Ooh!

05:11.001 --> 05:12.635
You're a mid-level hack,
Runkle.

05:12.670 --> 05:15.973
Check <i>Deadline.</i>

05:24.682 --> 05:27.217
I don't care that you lied.

05:27.251 --> 05:29.353
I don't care that your not gay.

05:29.386 --> 05:31.788
I wouldn't fuck you
if I was dying

05:31.822 --> 05:34.858
and your batch was
a magic potion.

05:34.892 --> 05:39.563
I care that you lost this agency
a major piece of business.

05:39.596 --> 05:42.599
Ooh!

05:55.946 --> 05:59.049
How'd it go, buddy boy?

05:59.083 --> 06:01.852
I'm sitting in the dark
in my underwear, Hank.

06:01.885 --> 06:04.654
- Aw.
- And I'm day drinking.

06:04.688 --> 06:06.823
Got it.

06:06.857 --> 06:10.961
What's next for us, buddy boy?

06:10.995 --> 06:13.364
What are your thoughts

06:13.397 --> 06:16.533
on a good old-fashioned
murder-suicide pact?

06:16.567 --> 06:18.235
Nah, not yet.

06:18.268 --> 06:20.303
Let's save that shit
for a rainier day.

06:20.337 --> 06:22.839
Oh, like it's not pouring
right now?

06:22.873 --> 06:25.141
I'm a fucking failure, Hank.

06:25.175 --> 06:28.178
I'm unemployed, divorced.

06:28.212 --> 06:31.048
I'm a shitty father.
No, you're not.

06:31.081 --> 06:33.716
Really, Hank?
You think I'm a good father?

06:33.751 --> 06:36.286
Not especially,
but you're not shitty.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.855
I mean, you are sometimes,
but we're all shitty sometimes.

06:38.889 --> 06:40.924
<i>Cat's in the Cradle</i>
and whatnot.

06:40.958 --> 06:44.227
Do you have any idea how
expensive this place is, Hank?

06:44.261 --> 06:45.929
The rent is insane.

06:45.963 --> 06:47.464
Why are you living
beyond your means?

06:47.498 --> 06:49.132
It's the only way I know how.

06:49.166 --> 06:52.702
My ex-wife went off and married
a big-time movie producer.

06:52.736 --> 06:56.439
So I went out
and rented a Malibu pussy pad.

06:56.473 --> 06:59.242
God, if these walls could talk.

06:59.276 --> 07:01.177
They'd tell you
to put your clothes back on,

07:01.211 --> 07:03.079
you depraved simian.

07:03.113 --> 07:05.815
Depraved or not, I'm living
paycheck to paycheck, Hank.

07:05.849 --> 07:09.552
And there are
no more paychecks!

07:09.586 --> 07:12.021
What am I gonna do?

07:12.089 --> 07:15.058
Look, I've got an idea.

07:15.092 --> 07:16.626
It's not
a particularly good one,

07:16.693 --> 07:18.227
and I'm sure I'm gonna suffer
as a result.

07:18.262 --> 07:20.397
But it's something that
could benefit the both of us--

07:20.431 --> 07:22.065
you mostly, though.

07:22.099 --> 07:25.702
Do I have to be gay again?

07:25.736 --> 07:26.903
- But you passed, Hank.
- Yes, I know.

07:26.937 --> 07:28.838
But I was not a well woman
at the time.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.941
Not only did you pass,

07:30.974 --> 07:34.444
you puked all over his piano...
Yes.

07:34.511 --> 07:37.413
And his cocaine.
No, it is uncool, dude.

07:37.448 --> 07:38.882
Yes, but we've made up since.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.550
You know, we've broken bread.

07:40.584 --> 07:42.719
We've shared women and cocaine.

07:42.753 --> 07:45.155
I think he likes me again.
Come on, Stu.

07:45.189 --> 07:46.356
Help us out here.

07:46.390 --> 07:48.191
Look, fellas,
as a producer,

07:48.225 --> 07:49.859
there's only so much I can do.

07:49.927 --> 07:54.731
The talent is driving the train
on this one.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.399
But...

07:56.433 --> 07:58.067
I will put in a call.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.636
Thank you.

07:59.670 --> 08:02.739
In the meantime, there is
something you got to do for me.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.007
Anything.

08:04.041 --> 08:07.177
You have got to convince Marcy
to sit down with me.

08:07.211 --> 08:09.313
I have got to plead my case.

08:09.346 --> 08:11.348
My business is going
to shit without her.

08:11.381 --> 08:13.149
I can't do that, Stu.

08:13.183 --> 08:15.251
She won't listen to me.

08:25.696 --> 08:28.231
Smurfy tits?
It's Hankness.

08:28.265 --> 08:30.600
Yeah, you got
to do me a favor.

08:30.634 --> 08:33.436
You got to sit down with Stu.

08:33.470 --> 08:36.573
I know he's a lying,
cheating scumbag.

08:36.607 --> 08:38.342
But he misses you
something fierce.

08:38.375 --> 08:41.177
Yeah, he misses
that sweet little blue pussy

08:41.211 --> 08:44.347
and that tight little raisin
of a cornhole.

08:44.381 --> 08:46.916
All you got
to do is sit down with him.

08:46.950 --> 08:48.685
He won't munch your box,
I promise.

08:48.719 --> 08:50.053
- Scout's honor!
- He won't munch your box.

08:50.087 --> 08:51.221
No, I won't.

08:51.255 --> 08:53.690
It's just she tastes
so fucking good.

08:53.724 --> 08:54.791
- Shush.
- If you say so.

08:54.825 --> 08:55.992
Hold on a second, all right?

08:56.026 --> 08:57.427
I never was
the pussy-eater you were.

08:57.461 --> 08:59.396
Well, you really should have
thought about it, Charlie--

08:59.429 --> 09:01.531
you know, compensate
for your shitty hang time

09:01.598 --> 09:02.932
and your serious lack
of inches.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.101
Jesus, fuck you, Stu.

09:04.134 --> 09:06.302
- Sorry, just keeping it real.
- Hold on.

09:06.336 --> 09:09.639
Will you shut the fuck up,
both of you?

09:09.673 --> 09:11.875
Yeah?
So you'll do it?

09:11.909 --> 09:14.945
Oh, she'll do it.
Mm!

09:14.978 --> 09:17.613
Later,
female ejaculator.

09:20.651 --> 09:22.552
♪ ♪

09:22.619 --> 09:24.420
Fuck you.

09:24.454 --> 09:27.957
Now, when you say "fuck you,"
what do you mean exactly?

09:28.025 --> 09:29.793
I mean just that--fuck you.
And fuck him.

09:29.826 --> 09:32.428
That arrogant motherfucker
was face-to-face

09:32.462 --> 09:34.564
with rock royalty,
and he fucking blew it.

09:34.598 --> 09:36.066
I really thought
we mended fences.

09:36.099 --> 09:37.834
We did. We have.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.203
I like you, Hank.
I'm a fan.

09:40.237 --> 09:42.872
But I can't collaborate with you
if you're not a fan of mine.

09:42.906 --> 09:45.441
- Why not?
- Because it's not natural!

09:45.475 --> 09:47.076
If I work with you, there will
always be this little voice

09:47.110 --> 09:48.277
in the back of my head--

09:48.312 --> 09:49.946
"He's not a fan.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.716
He thinks you suck.
Maybe you do suck."

09:52.749 --> 09:53.983
Who wants to live like that?

09:54.017 --> 09:55.451
"What are you? Tone deaf?"

09:55.485 --> 09:56.919
Like that?
Hank.

09:56.954 --> 09:57.955
What?

09:57.988 --> 10:01.558
You are a fan.
Aren't you?

10:03.560 --> 10:06.462
Yeahyeah, you know what?
I did what you asked me to do.

10:06.496 --> 10:08.130
You said, go back, listen
to your early stuff.

10:08.165 --> 10:10.400
That's what I did.
Really?

10:10.434 --> 10:11.635
I did, yeah.

10:11.668 --> 10:12.869
Which record?

10:12.903 --> 10:13.970
Which record?

10:14.004 --> 10:14.938
Which record?

10:14.972 --> 10:18.675
Which record?
Um...Uh...

10:18.709 --> 10:20.277
It was so good.

10:20.310 --> 10:23.279
It was, um...

10:23.313 --> 10:25.548
<i>Go Fetch.</i>

10:25.582 --> 10:27.450
You don't sound very sure
of yourself.

10:27.484 --> 10:29.018
No, no.
I mean, that was--

10:29.052 --> 10:30.253
you know what?

10:30.287 --> 10:32.455
That was really solid shit
right there.

10:32.489 --> 10:33.890
I really, really enjoyed it.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.626
- What was your favorite song?
- What song did I like best?

10:36.660 --> 10:38.194
On <i>Go Fetch,</i>
what was your favorite song?

10:38.228 --> 10:39.495
It's like children.

10:39.529 --> 10:41.297
How do you choose
a favorite song?

10:41.331 --> 10:43.266
But if I had to choose,

10:43.300 --> 10:45.302
like, if you put a gun
to my head...

10:45.335 --> 10:48.171
Uh...Sss...

10:48.205 --> 10:51.474
<i>Step and Fetch It.</i>

10:51.508 --> 10:54.444
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

10:54.478 --> 10:55.779
- That's my favorite too!
- Well, good.

10:55.812 --> 10:58.781
Yeah, I wrote that
in 15 minutes on the shitter.

10:58.815 --> 10:59.916
I think it's responsible

10:59.950 --> 11:01.418
for one of my least favorite
hemorrhoids.

11:01.451 --> 11:03.186
- Wow, that's a good story.
- ♪ Step and fetch it ♪

11:04.588 --> 11:05.822
♪ Step and fetch it ♪

11:05.856 --> 11:07.624
♪ I'm fucking crazy ♪

11:07.658 --> 11:10.961
Look, I'm in the middle
of an epic shit storm right now.

11:10.994 --> 11:14.130
I fired my manager last week,
because he's useless,

11:14.164 --> 11:15.865
and I think
he's stealing from me.

11:15.899 --> 11:17.634
They all steal.

11:17.668 --> 11:21.738
Mostly 'cause he was just
a useless fucking glad-hander.

11:21.772 --> 11:24.508
And I'm all out of cocaine,

11:24.541 --> 11:27.610
and my dealer's
not answering my calls.

11:27.644 --> 11:31.547
And I just miss
my magic songwriting powder.

11:31.581 --> 11:34.584
God, it makes me want
to take a dump

11:34.618 --> 11:37.687
just thinking about it.

11:37.721 --> 11:39.189
- Charlie?
- Yes?

11:39.222 --> 11:41.123
You're a useless fucking
glad-hander, aren't you?

11:41.158 --> 11:42.792
Yes, yes, I am.

11:42.826 --> 11:44.761
Oh, oh.

11:44.795 --> 11:47.964
Might you be in the market
for new representation, Atticus?

11:47.998 --> 11:50.767
Dude, you're
a Hollywood Agent--

11:50.801 --> 11:52.769
a wanker in a suit.

11:52.803 --> 11:55.739
What the fuck would you know
about managing rock bands?

11:55.772 --> 11:58.107
Hey, hey, don't judge
the wanker by the suit.

11:58.141 --> 12:01.277
This dude,
however bald and pasty--

12:01.311 --> 12:03.146
as rock and roll
as they come.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.681
And loves to pound the pussy.

12:04.715 --> 12:06.049
This is true.

12:06.083 --> 12:07.684
I love
to pound the pussy.

12:07.718 --> 12:09.019
He does.

12:09.052 --> 12:11.154
Look...

12:11.188 --> 12:14.057
If you can get me
some Peruvian flake,

12:14.091 --> 12:17.761
I'll maybe, possibly think
about throwing you in the mix.

12:17.794 --> 12:19.829
One thing
of Bolivian flake--done.

12:19.863 --> 12:22.298
Peruvian! Peruvian flake,
you fucking moron!

12:22.332 --> 12:24.200
Any country you want.

12:24.234 --> 12:26.603
- Oh, one more thing.
- Anything.

12:26.636 --> 12:28.004
I need you to find me

12:28.038 --> 12:30.940
the 1945 Martin D-28
acoustic guitar

12:31.007 --> 12:32.475
that used to belong
to the childhood friend

12:32.509 --> 12:33.910
I buried a few weeks ago.

12:33.944 --> 12:36.212
I'm recording
this tribute song for him,

12:36.246 --> 12:39.215
and I have
to have that fucking guitar.

12:39.249 --> 12:41.217
It was so beautiful.

12:41.251 --> 12:43.453
Talk about a gorgeous sound.

12:43.487 --> 12:47.791
It was like listening
to Jesus ejaculate

12:47.824 --> 12:50.326
into the mouth
of the Angel Gabriel.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.565
Great.
Excellent.

12:55.632 --> 12:58.234
You tell us where,
and we will get it for you.

12:58.268 --> 13:00.803
If I knew where,

13:00.837 --> 13:05.041
why the fuck would I need you?

13:16.420 --> 13:18.355
Hey.

13:18.388 --> 13:21.524
- Hey, yourself, young lady.
- We're looking for faith.

13:21.558 --> 13:23.192
Then you've come
to the right place.

13:23.226 --> 13:26.062
Come on in.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.068
Hank Moody.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.671
You don't seem that surprised
to see me.

13:34.704 --> 13:37.073
Well, I suppose
I conjured you.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.808
How do you like the book
so far?

13:38.842 --> 13:40.476
Thank you for buying
the hardcover, by the way.

13:40.510 --> 13:42.144
So far, so good.

13:42.179 --> 13:44.481
You got it right--
the rock world.

13:44.514 --> 13:46.349
Few writers do.

13:46.383 --> 13:48.651
Mmm...

13:48.685 --> 13:49.919
Will you settle down, Runks?

13:49.953 --> 13:51.988
Have you never seen a pair
of breasteses before?

13:52.022 --> 13:53.323
I wasn't looking at the--

13:53.356 --> 13:54.924
No offense.
They're lovely.

13:54.958 --> 13:56.092
None taken.
I know they are.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.961
- Good for you.
- She knows.

13:57.994 --> 13:59.228
Yeah, she knows.

13:59.262 --> 14:00.763
So how's your sobriety
treating you, Hank?

14:00.797 --> 14:02.532
Not as good as yours, I see.

14:05.469 --> 14:06.837
Well, what can I do you for?

14:06.903 --> 14:09.171
Well, I need a guitar.

14:09.206 --> 14:12.042
Mm.
You know what?

14:12.075 --> 14:14.210
I think I saw a guitar center
just down the road a piece.

14:14.244 --> 14:15.578
Can't miss it.

14:15.612 --> 14:17.113
And some cocaine.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.816
- Ooh.
- Ow!

14:19.850 --> 14:21.718
- Not just any guitar.
- Not just any cocaine--

14:21.751 --> 14:24.120
Peruvian flakes.
Ow!

14:25.589 --> 14:28.992
It belonged to your D.R.S.B.--
Your dead rock star boyfriend.

14:29.025 --> 14:30.526
Coining it.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.727
It's an old acoustic.

14:31.761 --> 14:32.828
A Martinelli.

14:32.863 --> 14:35.532
A Martin, jackass.

14:35.565 --> 14:36.699
I know it well.

14:36.733 --> 14:38.568
He used to leave it here
all the time.

14:38.602 --> 14:40.804
Said he loved the idea
of his favorite guitar

14:40.837 --> 14:42.638
spending time
with his favorite girl.

14:42.672 --> 14:44.340
Oh, that is sweet.

14:44.374 --> 14:47.009
So it's here?

14:47.043 --> 14:48.778
The guitar is here?
No, not anymore.

14:48.812 --> 14:50.413
He got in pretty deep

14:50.447 --> 14:52.182
with this crazy
fucking drug dealer.

14:52.215 --> 14:54.250
So he gave it to him to pay off
the money he owed him.

14:54.284 --> 14:57.754
- Oh, shit. Bummer.
- Doesn't have to be.

14:57.787 --> 15:01.924
I suppose I could take
you guys over there.

15:01.958 --> 15:03.326
Do a little one-stop shopping.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.096
Yeah, that would be
most groovy of you.

15:06.162 --> 15:07.296
Do you think

15:07.330 --> 15:11.067
that this guy might have
some cocaine as well?

15:14.070 --> 15:16.072
He's retarded, isn't he?

15:19.242 --> 15:20.543
You're Hank Moody.

15:20.577 --> 15:22.645
Hank Moody I am be.
How'd you know that?

15:22.679 --> 15:24.647
What, you don't think
I can read?

15:24.681 --> 15:26.716
Could you be any more
fucking condescending?

15:26.750 --> 15:28.284
You think just 'cause
I sell narcotics,

15:28.318 --> 15:30.853
I don't know how
to crack a fucking book?

15:30.887 --> 15:32.788
My shit just got
more expensive,

15:32.822 --> 15:33.956
Motherfucker.

15:33.990 --> 15:35.124
Hey, wait, I say

15:35.158 --> 15:36.292
Motherfucker just like that--

15:36.326 --> 15:37.593
That's my thing.

15:37.627 --> 15:39.195
Well you're not the only one,
motherfucker.

15:39.229 --> 15:42.532
- Motherfucker.
- Motherfucker.

15:42.566 --> 15:46.970
Sir, we need one pound
of your best Peruvian blend.

15:47.003 --> 15:49.538
We will be on our way.
"Flake," jackass.

15:49.573 --> 15:52.208
A pound?
You seriously want a pound?

15:52.242 --> 15:54.077
Yes, yes.

15:54.110 --> 15:55.277
How much is that gonna run me?

15:55.312 --> 15:57.547
- 35.
- Hundy?

15:57.614 --> 15:58.681
That's a bit expensive.

15:58.715 --> 15:59.916
We're gonna have
to make another stop

15:59.950 --> 16:01.251
back at the
automatic money machine.

16:01.284 --> 16:03.486
Grand.
35 grand.

16:03.520 --> 16:07.891
We're also gonna need
Tony's guitar.

16:07.924 --> 16:09.125
Why?

16:09.159 --> 16:11.127
Atticus Fetch.

16:11.161 --> 16:13.396
He's desperate
to record with it.

16:13.430 --> 16:14.964
Fuck that pompous dinosaur.

16:14.998 --> 16:16.833
Hey, that's exactly
what I said,

16:16.866 --> 16:18.467
to his face.

16:18.501 --> 16:22.771
- Boom.
- My man.

16:22.806 --> 16:27.177
So you want a guitar that is
currently in my possession

16:27.210 --> 16:31.614
and some
of my precious narcotics.

16:31.648 --> 16:34.517
The question is...

16:34.551 --> 16:36.853
What are you prepared
to do for me?

16:39.990 --> 16:42.592
Look...

16:42.626 --> 16:47.263
I think we both know that guitar
doesn't really belong to you.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.033
Sure, Tony gave it to you
to pay off his tab,

16:50.066 --> 16:53.135
but it really belongs
to the world.

16:53.169 --> 16:54.904
It should be out there
making music,

16:54.938 --> 16:57.140
not hidden in some dark lair.

16:57.173 --> 16:58.474
And who knows?

16:58.508 --> 17:01.077
That guitar could be the thing
that gets Atticus back

17:01.111 --> 17:05.013
to making some
beautiful fucking music again.

17:05.048 --> 17:08.550
You make
a convincing case, Faith.

17:08.585 --> 17:11.921
Always fancied myself a...

17:11.954 --> 17:13.790
patron of the arts.

17:13.823 --> 17:17.092
Mm, I got into dealing
so I could be closer

17:17.127 --> 17:20.163
to my favorite musicians.

17:20.195 --> 17:23.566
But...
I don't know.

17:23.599 --> 17:27.403
Also, Shari will give you
a blow job

17:27.436 --> 17:29.472
that could cure cancer.

17:29.506 --> 17:30.573
What?

17:30.607 --> 17:33.610
Why do you always do this to me?

17:33.643 --> 17:35.745
You said so yourself--
you need the practice.

17:35.779 --> 17:39.082
This pleases me.

17:39.115 --> 17:41.183
Usually I get head
from ugly strippers

17:41.217 --> 17:42.418
in exchange for drugs.

17:42.452 --> 17:45.955
But that's not gonna
get it done, folks.

17:45.989 --> 17:47.590
You know, if you want,
you can throw a shot

17:47.624 --> 17:48.691
into his mouth too.

17:48.725 --> 17:50.259
Up until recently,
he was a homo--

17:50.326 --> 17:52.594
big, big, big homo.
- Look, look...

17:52.629 --> 17:54.664
I tried to suck a man's dick.

17:54.731 --> 17:55.765
I couldn't do that shit.

17:55.799 --> 17:58.501
I'm too straight
for that shit, okay?

17:58.535 --> 18:02.605
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

18:02.639 --> 18:06.242
I like that suit.

18:06.276 --> 18:08.378
You like this suit?

18:08.411 --> 18:10.946
I know just where you
can get this suit.

18:10.980 --> 18:12.314
They got all sizes.

18:12.348 --> 18:13.782
I can point you
in the right direction.

18:13.817 --> 18:16.252
Boom!

18:16.286 --> 18:18.354
Take it off.

18:29.999 --> 18:32.167
Thank you so much
for seeing me.

18:32.202 --> 18:33.803
Go in the living room.

18:33.837 --> 18:36.773
I'll be right with you.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.247
Oh, hello.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.249
Uh, I'm Stu,

18:47.283 --> 18:49.285
Marcy's estranged hubby.

18:49.319 --> 18:50.820
Ophelia.

18:50.854 --> 18:54.490
Pleasure to meet you,
Ophelia.

18:54.524 --> 18:58.928
I understand
you betrayed Marcy's trust.

18:58.962 --> 19:01.397
That's true.
I did--most certainly did.

19:01.431 --> 19:04.167
I understand you put
your dirty cock

19:04.200 --> 19:06.802
in some young woman's mouth...

19:06.836 --> 19:07.970
twice.

19:08.004 --> 19:10.072
I'm sorry.
Who are you exactly?

19:10.106 --> 19:11.941
And now you, uh--

19:11.975 --> 19:14.210
you're trying to get back
in her good graces?

19:14.244 --> 19:15.812
It's true.

19:15.845 --> 19:17.079
I am.

19:17.113 --> 19:19.048
I-I'll do anything.

19:20.817 --> 19:21.884
And you think the sweater

19:21.918 --> 19:23.753
and the bottle of wine
is going to do it?

19:23.820 --> 19:26.389
No, no, no.
Of course not.

19:26.422 --> 19:30.759
But it is
a 1964 Georges de La Tour.

19:30.794 --> 19:33.830
I just hope
it's not too jammy.

19:38.001 --> 19:39.869
Uh, what on earth
is that thing?

19:39.903 --> 19:42.639
It's a cock cage.

19:42.672 --> 19:45.274
Oh, my.

19:45.308 --> 19:46.842
What is a cock cage?

19:46.876 --> 19:49.778
It is a male
chastity device...

19:49.813 --> 19:52.015
Available on my website.

19:52.048 --> 19:55.418
It traps your cock
in a flaccid state, Stu,

19:55.451 --> 19:57.553
which is very nice and cozy.

19:57.587 --> 20:00.456
But if you get aroused,

20:00.490 --> 20:03.226
if you surrender
to your baser instincts,

20:03.259 --> 20:06.128
it can make things
very unpleasant

20:06.162 --> 20:07.229
for little big man down there.

20:07.263 --> 20:09.932
- Oh, dear.
- Mm.

20:09.966 --> 20:11.701
Are you suggesting
I wear that thing?

20:11.734 --> 20:13.469
I'm not suggesting anything.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.238
I mean, you're the one who said
you wanted to make it up to me.

20:15.271 --> 20:20.075
Don't you think you
should wear that thing, Stu?

20:55.111 --> 20:56.512
He's right.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.748
It does sound like Jesus coming
in someone's mouth.

20:58.781 --> 21:01.617
Well done, gents.

21:03.553 --> 21:07.123
Now, where's
my fucking cocaine?

21:15.965 --> 21:17.032
That's it?

21:17.066 --> 21:18.667
That's what you got me?

21:18.701 --> 21:21.937
That's all
we could afford, Atticus--

21:21.971 --> 21:25.140
Mr. Fetch, sir.

21:25.174 --> 21:26.909
This piddly amount
of cocaine

21:26.943 --> 21:28.811
will last me
all of about 12 minutes.

21:28.845 --> 21:34.050
You stupid, useless,
bent motherfucker!

21:34.083 --> 21:36.218
Never get a suit
to do a man's job!

21:36.252 --> 21:37.620
"A suit"?

21:37.654 --> 21:38.821
You call me a suit?

21:38.855 --> 21:42.558
I gave up my suit for you,
literally.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.561
Don't you fucking dare.

21:58.007 --> 21:59.208
You're right.
She's right.

21:59.242 --> 22:00.376
You're absolutely right.

22:00.410 --> 22:02.979
This is--this is
a magnificent piece

22:03.012 --> 22:04.279
of rock and roll history,

22:04.314 --> 22:07.483
and it must be treated
accordingly.

22:07.517 --> 22:09.352
And, by the way,

22:09.385 --> 22:12.388
your defiance...

22:12.422 --> 22:15.792
gave me a thunderous erection.

22:19.028 --> 22:22.264
Aah!

22:22.298 --> 22:23.999
Look in the case.

22:24.033 --> 22:25.601
Check the compartment.

22:25.635 --> 22:29.405
He always kept drugs in there.

22:31.808 --> 22:34.911
Here you go,
rock-star asshole.

22:41.351 --> 22:44.387
This calls
for a celebration.

22:44.420 --> 22:45.621
Well done, gents.

22:45.655 --> 22:49.825
It'll be an honor
to work with both of you.

22:50.927 --> 22:53.729
See you bright and early
tomorrow...

22:53.763 --> 22:56.265
afternoon.

23:06.542 --> 23:10.112
Okay, so we're gonna go
to dinner now.

23:10.146 --> 23:11.580
Can I come?

23:11.614 --> 23:16.285
No, you filthy animal.

23:16.319 --> 23:20.256
Marcy, maybe you should leave
the TV on for him.

23:20.289 --> 23:23.258
- Good idea.
- Yeah? Yeah.

23:26.562 --> 23:29.331
Oh, no!
Not girl-on-girl porn!

23:29.365 --> 23:31.133
- Marcy!
- What?

23:31.167 --> 23:33.135
Don't forget to kiss
your hubby good night.

23:33.169 --> 23:36.172
You're right.
Of course.

23:36.205 --> 23:40.309
How rude of me.
Baby. No!

23:40.343 --> 23:43.479
Ooh! Ouchy.

23:45.348 --> 23:48.617
Oh, oh.

23:54.690 --> 23:55.957
No.

23:55.992 --> 23:57.927
Ouch.

23:57.960 --> 24:02.097
Aah!

24:02.131 --> 24:05.033
Oh, the wine
and the weed

24:05.068 --> 24:08.905
has made this
big-time rock manager sleepy.

24:08.938 --> 24:10.306
And sloppy.

24:10.339 --> 24:11.807
If you're gonna hang out
with rock stars,

24:11.841 --> 24:14.043
you better learn how
to handle your dope, buddy boy.

24:14.110 --> 24:15.945
That's dope advice.

24:15.978 --> 24:17.679
You can crash here.
Shari, can you--

24:17.713 --> 24:19.047
I'm not sucking his dick.

24:20.450 --> 24:22.819
I wasn't asking you to.

24:22.852 --> 24:25.721
I meant "Can you show him
the guest room?"

24:25.755 --> 24:27.923
Oh.
Okay, sure.

24:30.827 --> 24:33.696
- Can I see your boobies again?
- No.

24:33.729 --> 24:36.798
Just one?

24:36.833 --> 24:37.967
- Okay.
- Whoo-hoo.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.569
In answer
to your question from earlier,

24:40.603 --> 24:42.605
yes, he is retarded.

24:42.638 --> 24:44.006
But--but he means well.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.808
- He's funny.
- Mm.

24:45.842 --> 24:50.613
But you two are
especially cute together.

24:50.646 --> 24:52.414
Thanks for your help today.

24:52.448 --> 24:54.583
No.

24:54.617 --> 24:56.652
You were great the other day
at the funeral.

24:56.686 --> 24:59.755
I'm happy I get
to repay the favor.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.891
Boom.

25:01.924 --> 25:05.060
I like your writing, Hank.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.164
Yeah, go on.

25:08.197 --> 25:09.431
I like where this is going.

25:09.465 --> 25:10.966
Don't--don't stop yourself.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.134
I will say nothing.

25:12.168 --> 25:15.771
Well, you were...

25:15.805 --> 25:20.342
irritating in rehab,
but, uh...

25:20.376 --> 25:22.911
You've got that thing
that I keep an eye out for.

25:22.945 --> 25:24.313
What thing?

25:24.347 --> 25:25.781
The thing that's hard
to describe--

25:25.815 --> 25:29.084
that flash, that spark.

25:29.118 --> 25:30.786
You know,
some would call that genius.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.888
Oh, some might,
but I won't.

25:32.922 --> 25:35.958
I think "genius"
is the single most overused word

25:35.992 --> 25:37.293
of our lifetimes.

25:37.326 --> 25:38.927
Word.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.964
But I will say
that you're clearly doing

25:41.998 --> 25:44.100
exactly what you were put
on this planet to do.

25:44.133 --> 25:46.001
You are making use
of your gift,

25:46.035 --> 25:49.238
and that is attractive.

25:49.272 --> 25:50.973
It's just--
let me get this straight.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.576
You met me,
and you found me irritating.

25:53.609 --> 25:55.310
Thoroughly.

25:55.344 --> 25:56.511
And then you read my work,

25:56.546 --> 25:58.214
and you found me
less irritating,

25:58.247 --> 26:01.750
even attractive.

26:01.817 --> 26:03.418
Something like that.

26:03.452 --> 26:05.487
God, that is--that is,
like, every writer's dream.

26:05.521 --> 26:09.992
And that never happens, ever.

26:10.026 --> 26:13.929
No, once it did happen--
once, once before.

26:13.963 --> 26:16.265
I could really do something
with you.

26:16.299 --> 26:18.367
Huh?

26:18.401 --> 26:20.936
You're obviously
very talented.

26:20.970 --> 26:24.106
But you haven't nailed it yet.

26:24.140 --> 26:25.741
Classic underachiever.

26:25.775 --> 26:27.143
That's what my folks
always said.

26:27.176 --> 26:28.844
Oh, it's pretty exciting,
really.

26:28.878 --> 26:31.947
- What is?
- 'Cause I could be the hammer.

26:31.981 --> 26:33.449
Gulp.

26:33.482 --> 26:37.452
The only question left is,
do you want to be great, Hank?

26:40.823 --> 26:44.793
'Cause that's how I make
my mark on the world...

26:44.827 --> 26:48.664
by helping you
make your mark on the world.

27:07.650 --> 27:09.385
Good night.

27:09.418 --> 27:11.653
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no.

27:11.687 --> 27:13.789
Don't you want to help me
make my mark over here?

27:13.823 --> 27:16.826
I didn't say
this would be easy.
