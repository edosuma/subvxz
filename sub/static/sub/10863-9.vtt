00:30.040 --> 00:32.640
How embarrassing.

00:32.640 --> 00:33.960
What a geek!

00:33.960 --> 00:36.480
I'd burn that 
 if I were you.

00:36.480 --> 00:39.360
Yours isn't 
 any better.

00:39.360 --> 00:42.160
Gary, is that you?

00:42.160 --> 00:44.960
You look 
 exactly the same.

00:44.960 --> 00:45.960
Gee. Thanks.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.280
Look at Sam 
 in kindergarten!

00:48.280 --> 00:49.400
What a dork!

00:49.400 --> 00:51.760
And just so you guys 
 don't think

00:51.760 --> 00:53.480
I'm getting away 
 with anything...

00:53.480 --> 00:56.480
This is me 
 in first grade.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.840
[Everyone laughs]

00:58.840 --> 01:00.800
Cute.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.400
Why do we have to bring 
 these things, anyway?

01:03.400 --> 01:05.239
Because photos 
 tell the future.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.240
They do?

01:06.240 --> 01:08.880
Sure. Look at 
 Gary's picture.

01:08.880 --> 01:13.280
You can already tell he's 
 going to be very serious.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.160
And look at 
 Kiki's smile!

01:15.160 --> 01:16.800
You know she's 
 gonna be trouble.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.440
You got that right.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.880
What does that dumb 
 look on frank's face mean?

01:21.880 --> 01:23.880
don't push me, 
 little skid mark.

01:23.880 --> 01:27.880
Seriously, you can learn all 
 sorts of stuff from pictures.

01:27.880 --> 01:31.600
The question is, 
 do you really want to know

01:31.600 --> 01:33.400
what the future 
 has in store,

01:33.400 --> 01:36.400
or is it better off 
 being a surprise?

01:36.400 --> 01:38.920
You might say 
 you want to know,

01:38.920 --> 01:40.440
but what 
 if you discovered

01:40.440 --> 01:45.600
that the future held 
 something incredibly evil

01:45.600 --> 01:50.080
and there was nothing 
 you could do to change it?

01:50.080 --> 01:54.440
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society,

01:54.440 --> 01:57.000

02:28.880 --> 02:31.920
Yo, Matt! 
 You read this book?

02:31.920 --> 02:32.760
Um, no.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.880
Oh. Well, are you sure 
 you haven't read it?

02:37.880 --> 02:41.120
Here. Look closer.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.320
Ha ha ha ha!

02:43.320 --> 02:45.880
Guess I was wrong. 
 The book read you.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.120
Oh, no! Leave it! 
 It looks good.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.440

03:11.720 --> 03:13.880

[Man] OK, superstars. 
 Listen up!

03:19.320 --> 03:21.360
Got your 
 pretty pictures.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.200
Good practice 
 today, guys.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.320
Jason. 
 Good practice, guys.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.400
Lots of hustle 
 out there.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.880
Hello? Anyone home?

04:35.880 --> 04:38.320
Hey, don't bother 
 wiping your feet.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.400
It's a mess 
 in here already.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.320
Want some tea?

04:42.320 --> 04:45.320
No, thanks. I...

04:45.320 --> 04:47.800
I came about my pictures.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.360
Yeah.

04:49.360 --> 04:53.520
You were at my school 
 last week?

04:53.520 --> 04:55.280
The basketball team?

04:55.280 --> 04:58.720
Oh, yeah. 
 You're the ketchup kid.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.200
What is it?

05:00.200 --> 05:01.720
Hey, you want 
 some more prints?

05:01.720 --> 05:03.640
Not exactly.

05:03.640 --> 05:06.880
You know, I used to be a 
 pretty decent photographer.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.880
"Always reveal the inner 
 man." That was my motto.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.400
What's your 
 motto now?

05:11.400 --> 05:13.680
"Take cash, 
 'cause checks bounce."

05:13.680 --> 05:16.880
Whoa. What is this?

05:16.880 --> 05:22.240
It's my picture. 
 Must be some mistake.

05:22.240 --> 05:26.240
No mistake. This is 
 your portrait, all right.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.840
But...

05:27.840 --> 05:29.600
Tell me if I'm wrong.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.560
No one notices you, 
 right?

05:31.560 --> 05:33.760
You let people 
 walk all over you?

05:33.760 --> 05:36.280
You don't take action?

05:36.280 --> 05:38.520
In other words...

05:38.520 --> 05:40.960
You are invisible.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.320
Get it?

05:43.840 --> 05:46.760
Camera never lies.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.760
Look, my mom paid 
 for real pictures!

05:48.760 --> 05:50.760
She'd kill me 
 if I gave her that.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.240
Too bad. It's a 
 striking resemblance.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.080
Can you just take 
 another one?

05:54.080 --> 05:55.680
Sorry. No can do.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.760
1 per customer, and 
 I don't give refunds.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.280
Great.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.240
But...

06:05.880 --> 06:08.520
Maybe I can give you 
 something to make up for it.

06:08.520 --> 06:09.720
Like what?

06:09.720 --> 06:12.920
Maybe... a camera?

06:12.920 --> 06:15.680
You just have 
 an extra one lying around?

06:15.680 --> 06:18.160
As a matter of fact, 
 I do.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.200
There's this 1 camera 
 I think might be

06:21.200 --> 06:23.200
just the thing 
 for a kid like you.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.200
Really?

06:24.200 --> 06:25.280
Mm-hmm.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.200
You keep it 
 in a safe?

06:28.200 --> 06:29.600
Oh, absolutely.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.160
It's one-of-a-kind.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.400

 instant picture cameras,

06:33.400 --> 06:35.800

Here you go.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.200
The thing 
 really works?

06:56.200 --> 06:57.360
Oh, it really works.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.680
I can really have it?

06:58.680 --> 07:00.880
Only if you 
 really want it.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.520
I want it! 
 Awesome. Thanks.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.160
Hey--listen, kid.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.560
You be careful with that.

07:07.560 --> 07:11.160
Sometimes it kind of...

07:11.160 --> 07:12.640
I'll be careful, 
I swear.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.960
Yeah.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.160
Oh, and kid?

You don't mind 
 if we... thanks!

10:31.360 --> 10:33.600
It doesn't slide right.

You know, you're 
 a total butt head.

10:52.240 --> 10:55.000
What'd you say?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.240
I heard you got the wrong 
 end of a brain transplant.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.600

12:53.720 --> 12:55.520
I'm figuring out 
 who in my class

12:55.520 --> 12:58.160
deserves to have 
 their picture taken.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.040
Run that by me again?

13:01.040 --> 13:02.960
Can you promise 
 to keep a secret?

13:06.080 --> 13:07.880
Hmm... OK.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.560
This is really 
 going to sound weird,

13:10.560 --> 13:13.960
but you know that guy who took 
 the basketball pictures last week?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.360
Yeah.

13:15.360 --> 13:19.560
Well, he gave me this.

 of magic camera.

Hmm. Warm.

13:30.040 --> 13:34.040
OK, have you totally 
 lost your mind,

13:34.040 --> 13:36.280
or is this some 
 kind of sick joke?

13:36.280 --> 13:39.480
No, I swear 
 it's the truth. Watch.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.760
You see that over there? 
 Watch.

13:42.760 --> 13:45.200
Just hold on. Wait.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.000
That's... 
 Really great.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.520
It's gotta be jammed, 
 or something.

Look, kid. I had 
 that camera for 20 years

15:47.240 --> 15:49.480

 nothing but bad luck.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.640

 i don't understand--

look, kid, I used to be 
 just like you--

16:00.400 --> 16:02.120
afraid of life, 
 afraid of everything.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.160
When that camera 
 came into my life,

16:04.160 --> 16:05.880
I thought all 
 my troubles were over.

16:05.880 --> 16:06.960
[Sighs]

16:06.960 --> 16:08.400
That camera meant power,

16:08.400 --> 16:11.400
except the only power 
 it had was over me.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.560
It destroys 
 everything it shoots.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.000
don't let it 
 destroy you!

16:15.000 --> 16:16.640
Mr. Calhoun, 
 what is it?

16:16.640 --> 16:20.040
You saw the pictures. 
 Have you seen the Gremlin yet?

16:20.040 --> 16:22.360
Gremlin? The little thing 
 in all the pictures?

16:22.360 --> 16:25.360
Yeah. 
 That little "thing."

16:25.360 --> 16:28.360
Near as I can figure, it's all 
 that little monster's fault.

16:28.360 --> 16:31.680
What it is, I don't know. 
 Hey! I don't care, anyway.

16:31.680 --> 16:32.880
Mr. Calhoun, 
 I don't want it!

16:32.880 --> 16:34.840
You've gotta 
 take it back.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.840
Sorry, I couldn't take 
 it back if I wanted to.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.360
You can't 
 give it away.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.480
I tried 1,000 times.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.200
You gave it to me.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.480
<i>Uh-uh-uh, no. 
 I handed it to you.</i>

16:44.480 --> 16:47.520
That camera chose you, 
 just like it chose me.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.120
Maybe someday you can 
 get rid of it, too.

16:51.120 --> 16:54.880
Until then, 
I feel sorry for you.

16:54.880 --> 16:55.880
[Sighs]

16:55.880 --> 16:57.920
Misty, darling?

16:57.920 --> 16:59.640
<i> Andiamo.</i>

17:21.400 --> 17:23.200
[Click]

17:23.200 --> 17:26.280
Hey! Aren't you supposed to say 
 "cheese" when you aim that thing?

17:26.280 --> 17:27.480
Where are you going?

17:27.480 --> 17:28.840
The movies, 
 and we're late.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.840
You can't-- 
 I mean, don't go.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.040
We haven't 
 been out in weeks.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.320
It's only a movie.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.080
Besides, you wouldn't 
 be interested.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.360
It's got dialogue.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.400
Yeah, but... you might 
 have an accident!

17:38.400 --> 17:40.360
Don't be silly.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.880
You can't go. 
 Don't go, please!

17:42.880 --> 17:44.400
What's gotten 
 into you?

17:44.400 --> 17:46.840
I can't explain, 
 but don't go.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.360
Listen, we'll talk 
 about it when we get back.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.680
Gotta go. Bye.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.240
Why didn't you 
 give it back?

18:02.240 --> 18:04.320
He wouldn't take it.

18:04.320 --> 18:08.240
Amy, I just took 
 a picture of Mom and Dad.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.440
What?

18:10.440 --> 18:12.400
Don't look at it.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.320
If we don't look at it, 
 maybe it won't happen.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.880
We have to!

18:28.920 --> 18:29.920
Noooo!

18:29.920 --> 18:32.320
We've gotta call 
 the police.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.560
And tell them what?

18:33.560 --> 18:36.520
I don't know! 
 We've gotta do something!

18:38.400 --> 18:40.400
Where are you going?

18:49.440 --> 18:51.040
<i> That should do it.</i>

18:53.440 --> 18:57.440
I know, but what if 
 the camera's already--

19:03.080 --> 19:05.360
[car radio playing]

19:05.360 --> 19:06.920
[Changes station]

19:09.440 --> 19:11.640
[Changes to 
 another station]

19:11.640 --> 19:12.480
No way.

19:13.960 --> 19:17.000
I'm gonna smash 
 that camera to bits!

19:17.000 --> 19:18.880
Forget it! 
 It won't work.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.800
We've gotta do something.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.920
Matt, it's gonna get 
 Mom and Dad.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.520
Matt, what are 
 we going to do?

19:32.400 --> 19:34.200
I got an idea.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.400
Matt, what are 
 you doing?

19:50.160 --> 19:51.400
Matt?

20:01.120 --> 20:04.320
I don't know 
 if this is gonna work,

20:04.320 --> 20:06.760
but it's worth a try. 
 Get down.

20:06.760 --> 20:10.360
OK. Let's see what 
 this thing does to itself.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.400
Ready?

20:11.400 --> 20:12.400
1...

20:13.320 --> 20:14.800

20:16.000 --> 20:17.200
And 3!

20:17.200 --> 20:20.200
Aaaaarrrrggghhh!

20:22.480 --> 20:23.560
Did it work?

20:23.560 --> 20:25.240
Yes.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.320
[Telephone rings]

20:29.840 --> 20:30.760
Hello?

20:30.760 --> 20:33.200
Hi, Matt? It's Dad.

20:33.200 --> 20:36.160
Your mom and I are on 
 the side of the road.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.440
What happened? 
 You guys all right?

20:37.440 --> 20:39.360
No, no, no. 
 We're OK. We're fine.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.760
Some fool truck nearly 
 ran us off the road,

20:41.760 --> 20:43.920
and we missed 
 the movies.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.760
We'll be home soon, OK?

20:45.760 --> 20:47.360
OK! Bye!

20:50.360 --> 20:53.360
They're OK. 
 They're on their way home.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.000
Man, I thought 
 they were goners.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.280
Yes! 
 What's the matter?

21:01.280 --> 21:02.840
What's up?

21:07.120 --> 21:08.520
I don't think that...

21:10.760 --> 21:11.640
Get down!

21:11.640 --> 21:13.400
What's going on?

21:13.400 --> 21:16.120
The Gremlin! 
 He's in the camcorder!

21:19.880 --> 21:21.720
Don't let it shoot you!

21:24.160 --> 21:26.320
Help me, Matt!

21:37.160 --> 21:39.760
Is it safe?

21:39.760 --> 21:41.960
I...I think so.

21:43.840 --> 21:44.840
Get down!

21:47.720 --> 21:49.200
<i> Smile for the birdie!</i>

21:49.200 --> 21:51.160
<i> Aaaahhhh!</i>

22:18.800 --> 22:22.800
Calhoun was right 
 about the camera.

22:22.800 --> 22:26.680
It destroys 
 everything it shoots.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.680
[Car horn honks]

22:28.680 --> 22:30.240
Mom and Dad.

22:37.240 --> 22:41.000
Now we have to figure out 
 how to tell Mom and Dad.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.240
Oh, boy.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.240
Cool.

22:59.240 --> 23:01.440
So, can I have 
 my picture back?

23:01.440 --> 23:05.280
Sure. But first, I want 
 to get a group shot.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.960
Aaahhh!

23:11.800 --> 23:14.200
It's only a prop 
 from Dad's store.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.560
What are they scared of?

23:15.560 --> 23:17.720
Gee. I don't know.
