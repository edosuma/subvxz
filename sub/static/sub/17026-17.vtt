00:43.839 --> 00:46.319
Well, the heat is
still not working,

00:46.319 --> 00:48.319
but the stove is just fine.

00:48.439 --> 00:49.999
Yeah, I can smell that.

00:50.159 --> 00:51.679
We've got eggs poached,
English muffins,

00:51.759 --> 00:54.519
rashers, juice, coffee.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.839
You're catering
to my every need.

00:56.959 --> 00:57.839
Every?

00:57.999 --> 00:59.919
All the ones I
can think of.

01:00.079 --> 01:02.399
I'll try and come
up with some more.

01:03.879 --> 01:04.998
You know, my mum used

01:05.159 --> 01:07.559
to bring me breakfast in
bed every Saturday morning

01:07.719 --> 01:09.919
when I was a kid.

01:10.079 --> 01:12.119
We had no money really,
barely scraped by,

01:12.279 --> 01:15.359
but it was the one luxury
I could always expect.

01:15.479 --> 01:16.839
That sounds nice.

01:16.959 --> 01:18.999
You?

01:18.999 --> 01:20.079
Me what?

01:20.079 --> 01:21.719
What was it like
when you were a kid?

01:21.879 --> 01:23.199
You never talk
about that stuff.

01:23.359 --> 01:26.279
I was barely living
before I met you.

01:27.319 --> 01:29.999
What about your parents?

01:30.159 --> 01:31.559
Do you have brothers
and sisters?

01:31.719 --> 01:32.799
I don't know
anything about you.

01:32.959 --> 01:35.079
Aliens dropped me
from a spaceship

01:35.199 --> 01:36.199
just outside of Perth

01:36.359 --> 01:38.479
as a fully-formed adult
in 2007.

01:38.639 --> 01:42.199
I'm two in Earth years, but
I-I really love this planet.

01:45.359 --> 01:49.559
Uh, raised by my mother,
only child.

01:49.679 --> 01:51.839
Tell me more.

01:53.999 --> 01:55.119
Eat.

01:55.239 --> 01:58.239
Oh, come on.

01:58.359 --> 01:59.758
(SIGHS)

01:59.918 --> 02:03.838
Now, why does every conversation
with you have to end in sex?

02:03.998 --> 02:06.118
Well, that sounds
like a complaint.

02:06.198 --> 02:07.838
No.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.718
I mean...

02:12.838 --> 02:14.598
(LAUGHING) No.

02:16.558 --> 02:18.598
How do I look?

02:18.758 --> 02:19.958
Y-you look fine.

02:20.158 --> 02:21.638
The turtleneck's
not too severe?

02:21.758 --> 02:22.958
No. What are...

02:23.118 --> 02:24.718
You're nervous.

02:24.718 --> 02:25.678
Well, yeah.

02:25.798 --> 02:26.958
I hear the director's
really tough.

02:27.118 --> 02:29.958
I want to be sure when she looks
at me she sees a mom.

02:30.118 --> 02:31.998
You know?
Yes, she does, baby.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.318
Oh, excuse me.

02:34.438 --> 02:35.878
You'd think with all the money
we're spending,

02:36.078 --> 02:38.118
we'd get some sushi
or something.

02:38.318 --> 02:40.958
(CHUCKLES)
Chicago Connection
Adoption Agency.

02:41.158 --> 02:42.758
For 10,000 bucks,
you get cold coffee,

02:42.918 --> 02:43.958
a stale bagel,
and a baby.

02:44.118 --> 02:45.678
(WHISPERING)
You stop.

02:45.838 --> 02:46.638
(WHISPERING)
Did you...?

02:46.798 --> 02:48.918
Come on,
that was a little funny.

02:48.998 --> 02:50.118
Come on.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.158
Burt Mulligan,
knee and shoulder pain,

02:51.318 --> 02:52.558
drove his car
into Lake Michigan.

02:52.558 --> 02:54.318
He did what?
I never had
a moving violation.

02:54.318 --> 02:55.278
It wasn't his fault.

02:55.278 --> 02:56.518
Were you the
one driving?

02:56.678 --> 02:59.238
No, no, he was, but we were
only following directions.

02:59.398 --> 03:00.798
Someone told you to drive
through Lake Michigan?

03:00.958 --> 03:02.078
Kathy did.
Who's Kathy?

03:02.198 --> 03:03.318
Our GPS system.

03:03.438 --> 03:05.038
Your GPS said to
drive into the water?

03:05.158 --> 03:06.158
Not exactly.

03:06.318 --> 03:08.038
It just turned out
that way.

03:08.198 --> 03:10.038
Multicultural adoptions
have been on the rise

03:10.158 --> 03:11.678
in the last ten years.

03:11.838 --> 03:14.118
Shorter wait times
and reduced fees

03:14.278 --> 03:15.318
have all played
a key role.

03:15.438 --> 03:17.198
Reduced fees?

03:17.358 --> 03:18.758
Why wait a year
for a white baby

03:18.918 --> 03:20.598
when you can pick up
a six-pack of black kids

03:20.758 --> 03:21.558
on the way home
from work?

03:21.718 --> 03:23.438
You think this
is funny, huh?

03:23.598 --> 03:25.758
The devaluing of
black children?

03:25.758 --> 03:26.598
Calm down.

03:26.718 --> 03:27.918
It was a joke.

03:28.078 --> 03:29.438
I mean, why are
you guys here?

03:29.598 --> 03:31.438
It's obvious that
you're not serious.

03:31.598 --> 03:33.318
What is your problem?
I'm sure you're all feeling

03:33.518 --> 03:35.998
some stress from this process.
My problem is the two of you
making a joke out of this.

03:36.198 --> 03:37.718
Cate, they're just
blowing off steam.
Humour is an important coping...

03:37.878 --> 03:39.797
They need to shut up and pay
attention to what's going on.

03:39.997 --> 03:41.717
Please try to be respectful
of each other.
You need to get that stick

03:41.917 --> 03:44.197
up out of your ass.
OK, let's get
out of here.

03:49.237 --> 03:51.317
I feel bad for the kid
who ends up with you.

04:02.797 --> 04:05.317
The GPS system said go straight.

04:05.317 --> 04:06.877
Kathy has this kind
of authority.

04:06.877 --> 04:08.117
But guys, Kathy
was telling you

04:08.277 --> 04:09.317
to drive off
an embankment.

04:09.437 --> 04:10.797
We asked
for an alternate route,

04:10.957 --> 04:12.597
but she kept saying
go straight.

04:12.757 --> 04:14.037
So you knowingly
crashed into the lake

04:14.157 --> 04:15.957
because a computer voice
in your car told you to?

04:16.036 --> 04:17.837
She's got satellite data.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.437
And you don't think there's
anything wrong with that?

04:19.557 --> 04:20.677
Of course there is.

04:20.797 --> 04:22.277
Kathy's broken.

04:22.437 --> 04:23.917
(CHUCKLING)
OK.

04:24.037 --> 04:26.237
I'll be back to
sew up the cut.

04:26.597 --> 04:27.997
OK, well, I'm sure they

04:28.157 --> 04:30.397
can get her back
to baseline if they just give...

04:30.397 --> 04:32.717
OK, all right,
I'll be there.

04:32.717 --> 04:34.157
See you then, thanks.

04:34.477 --> 04:35.837
That your mom?

04:35.957 --> 04:38.077
Yeah, she got a little
loopy on the plane.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.717
Well, the altitude
could have dropped her SATS.

04:39.837 --> 04:40.797
That's what I thought.

04:40.957 --> 04:42.557
They'll buff her up
in the nursing home.

04:42.677 --> 04:43.797
It'll be fine.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.677
I'm gonna head over
there after my shift.

04:45.677 --> 04:47.477
How long has it been
since you've seen your mom?

04:47.597 --> 04:48.557
(SIGHS)

04:48.677 --> 04:49.597
I don't know.

04:49.717 --> 04:51.877
It's a... a while.

04:51.997 --> 04:54.717
(MICN CALL)

04:54.837 --> 04:57.197
I better get that.

04:57.357 --> 04:59.597
Frank, Keflex for
the cellulitic mime in three

04:59.757 --> 05:02.717
and Duct tape girl needs
a note for her parole officer.

05:02.877 --> 05:04.277
I forgot how much
I love it here.

05:04.437 --> 05:05.277
You can't discharge
a patient

05:05.397 --> 05:08.077
without a med
reconciliation form.

05:08.197 --> 05:09.117
A what?

05:09.277 --> 05:11.037
New requirement
from the joint commission.

05:11.197 --> 05:13.917
We have to be sure all meds are
current in our records.

05:14.037 --> 05:15.837
I see.
And we pretty much

05:15.997 --> 05:17.197
stopped using Keflex
a few years ago,

05:17.397 --> 05:18.517
you know, with all
the MRSA around.

05:18.637 --> 05:19.756
Right.

05:19.916 --> 05:21.836
Explosion in an apartment
building on Dearborn.

05:21.916 --> 05:22.996
Six coming in, five minutes out.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.036
Gates, Sam, outside.
Somebody find Morris.

05:26.116 --> 05:26.956
We need another attending

05:27.076 --> 05:27.916
down here.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.196
Um... hello?

05:29.356 --> 05:30.996
Oh, I thought you might want
to lay low,

05:31.156 --> 05:32.636
sit out your first one.
It's not my first one.

05:32.716 --> 05:33.556
You know what I mean.

05:33.716 --> 05:34.756
You've been
out of the loop.

05:34.916 --> 05:35.916
I spent the
last five years

05:36.076 --> 05:37.876
running a refugee
hospital in Darfur.

05:38.036 --> 05:39.996
That's more loop than anyone
should see in a lifetime.

05:40.156 --> 05:42.276
All right then, you do what
you feel comfortable with.

05:42.436 --> 05:44.596
All right,
get Brenner down here!

06:04.876 --> 06:06.996
It's been
over a week.

06:09.196 --> 06:12.636
You said she could only
live like that a month.

06:12.796 --> 06:15.956
Well, they'll find
another heart.

06:16.116 --> 06:18.156
I heard it can take
a year sometimes.

06:18.276 --> 06:20.516
Yeah, but she's
on the top of the list.

06:25.196 --> 06:28.516
Can I stay here today
instead of going to school?

06:28.636 --> 06:30.396
What do you think?

06:30.596 --> 06:32.716
No.
(LAUGHING)
No, no.

06:32.916 --> 06:35.756
Now, how's your, um,
how's your foster family?

06:35.876 --> 06:37.116
Elaine's OK.

06:37.276 --> 06:39.476
She's the mom.

06:39.556 --> 06:43.036
Stan's...

06:43.156 --> 06:44.436
a little weird.

06:44.556 --> 06:47.476
He's... weird?

06:47.636 --> 06:50.996
He's, like, all
flirty and silly.

06:51.156 --> 06:53.636
Makes dumb jokes and walks
around without his clothes on.

06:54.636 --> 06:56.636
He does what?

06:56.756 --> 06:58.636
He's a freak.

06:58.796 --> 07:01.195
He acts more like a kid
than an adult sometimes.

07:01.315 --> 07:04.075
It creeps
us all out.

07:10.795 --> 07:13.035
I've got to go down
to the ER now, Lucy.

07:13.195 --> 07:16.275
I want you to wait here
with your mom

07:16.435 --> 07:18.235
until it's time
for school, OK?

07:18.355 --> 07:19.915
OK.

07:21.595 --> 07:22.915
OK.

One of my brothers was crying ...

... Saying he don't want to go into
care.

08:23.275 --> 08:25.315
Action for Children come out to the
house.

08:26.635 --> 08:29.235
They just asked my family members if
they could help us ...

08:29.235 --> 08:30.795
... and have someone to talk to.

08:31.155 --> 08:34.315
It has worked to stop us from being
put into care.

08:34.794 --> 08:37.395
We're here for as long as it takes.

08:40.594 --> 08:43.433
A big thank you to the readers
of Prima Baby magazine

08:43.433 --> 08:46.394

But hurry,

Don't miss out at Currys now

09:11.074 --> 09:13.034
Whatever you grow
your plants in,

09:13.114 --> 09:15.114
you need Moisture Control compost

09:15.194 --> 09:16.594
from Miracle-Gro.

09:16.674 --> 09:18.314
It stores water and releases it

09:18.394 --> 09:20.234
as plants need it.

09:20.354 --> 09:22.514
And because it's full of
Miracle-Gro plant food,

09:22.594 --> 09:24.474
plants grow twice as big.

09:27.394 --> 09:28.674
It's Gro Time.

'Ello, mate.

09:33.034 --> 09:35.754
Weeds - they really are
relentless little blighters.

09:35.874 --> 09:37.994
If you don't kill the leaves
and the roots,

09:38.074 --> 09:39.474
some keep coming back.

09:39.554 --> 09:41.674
Resolva 24H does both,

09:41.794 --> 09:44.194
giving you visible results
in 24 hours.

09:44.314 --> 09:46.794
And no more root means
no more weed.

09:48.114 --> 09:49.194
Aargh!

09:51.114 --> 09:53.274
How are your teeth today?
Not so clean?

09:53.394 --> 09:55.074
That's because
plaque starts to build up

09:55.194 --> 09:56.994
right after you get
a cleaning from the dentist.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.034
Some advice?

09:58.154 --> 10:00.754
Fight it with the latest innovation
from Colgate.

10:02.234 --> 10:05.194
Not only does it provide
12-hour antibacterial protection

10:05.274 --> 10:06.874
against plaque and gum problems,

10:06.954 --> 10:09.154
it also has a new:

10:09.274 --> 10:11.314
..that fights plaque
between dentist visits.

10:11.434 --> 10:12.954
It removes
build-up

10:13.074 --> 10:14.474
to give you
that...

10:14.594 --> 10:16.354
dentist-clean feeling
that lasts.

10:17.554 --> 10:19.193
The dentist-clean feeling
that lasts.

..it can be re-sanded
up to 3 times for longer life.

10:31.313 --> 10:35.393
Ever had that feeling that your love
life is spiralling out of control?

10:35.393 --> 10:36.993
You've made a life-changing decision

10:36.993 --> 10:40.353
and promised to organise a make
or break trip to Rome and then...

10:40.353 --> 10:43.153
at the crucial moment
when you absolutely HAD to book

10:43.153 --> 10:45.553
the last two remaining flights...

10:45.553 --> 10:47.393
..you suddenly lost internet
connection?

10:48.913 --> 10:50.553

10:50.553 --> 10:52.753
it was all just a bad dream.

OK, Mrs D.

12:47.712 --> 12:48.832
They're just more
scared than anything.

This is Norman, the good

13:01.592 --> 13:02.792
They're in good hands, Mrs D.
Cleared all the ortho cases

13:02.912 --> 13:04.352
to the cast room,
picked up five more beds.

13:04.552 --> 13:05.312
Good. This
is Norman.

13:05.472 --> 13:06.872
He needs access, fluids,
and pain meds.

13:07.032 --> 13:09.472
Oh, no, no, take Mrs Dixon,
she's much sicker than me.

13:09.632 --> 13:10.432
Yeah?
No, I got her.

13:10.512 --> 13:11.392
Uh, you help Gates.

13:11.552 --> 13:12.792
Maybe you can benefit
from having

13:12.952 --> 13:14.912
an experienced
resident in the room.

13:15.072 --> 13:16.872
Just in case.
Just in case what?

13:18.352 --> 13:20.232
First you can't trust
a GPS system,

13:20.232 --> 13:21.752
then it's your parents.
Then it's the government.

13:21.912 --> 13:24.392
It's a slippery slope.
You're losing me.

13:24.552 --> 13:25.392
We're not ashamed
of it.

13:25.512 --> 13:26.952

What are you,
some kind of rebel

13:33.832 --> 13:34.632

all the rules?

bad boy

Is that what you are?

13:42.911 --> 13:43.791
Knee's all done.

13:43.951 --> 13:45.111

What's so wrong with that?

13:50.791 --> 13:52.631
Nothing, but, you know,
being a little free-spirited

13:52.751 --> 13:53.871
can be healthy at times.

13:53.871 --> 13:54.711
Might even save your life.

14:02.551 --> 14:03.591
Who'd you vote for?

14:03.711 --> 14:05.311
We were afraid of change.

OK, well, it's obviously time
for you two to live a little.

14:10.911 --> 14:12.791
See this?

14:16.031 --> 14:16.991
Cut it off.

14:17.151 --> 14:18.951
What?
Wait.

14:19.071 --> 14:20.231
That's against the law.

15:04.511 --> 15:05.631

Mm-hmm.

15:05.751 --> 15:06.831
That's kind of what
happened to me.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.911
You were bit
by a spider?
No.

15:09.071 --> 15:10.311

that ambulance

15:10.471 --> 15:11.711
blew up last year,
it's like I'm fearless.

15:11.871 --> 15:13.711
Its like I've got
a whole other sense.
A "sense"?

15:13.870 --> 15:15.950
I can feel when someone
around me is in distress.

15:16.070 --> 15:17.550
Like how Superman always knew

15:17.710 --> 15:19.110
Lois Lane was in trouble.
I don't know.

15:19.270 --> 15:21.110
Whatever it is, it's a gift.
I'm supposed to use it for good.

Silvadene down here.

15:25.150 --> 15:26.110
Oh, you mean Aquacel?

15:26.230 --> 15:27.190
That's what we use now.

15:27.310 --> 15:28.350
It's, uh, it's better.

15:28.350 --> 15:30.270
Big improvement.
You'll like it.

15:30.390 --> 15:32.110
A little fluid on Morrison's.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.390
You have any pain?

15:34.510 --> 15:36.510
No. And that's
the strange part.

15:36.590 --> 15:37.750
I never get hurt.

15:37.910 --> 15:39.830
Fire, car crashes,

in danger, I just go.

15:41.350 --> 15:42.390
And I'm fine.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.470
Well, that fluid on the
ultrasound, that could be blood.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.590
We need a special
x-ray called a CAT scan.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.030
Well, hurry up.
I want to go see her kids.

15:48.150 --> 15:49.350
PO contrast and send him down.

15:49.510 --> 15:50.910
Oh, we don't use contrast
for belly CTs anymore.

15:51.070 --> 15:52.350
Oh, no?
Mm-mm, no.

15:52.550 --> 15:54.830
Not since we got
the 64-slice scanner.
(CHUCKLES)

15:54.910 --> 15:55.870
How long you had that?

15:56.030 --> 15:57.870
Oh, couple of years.

get the Aquacel.

as soon as we can.

We're taking him to CT.

He's cool.

16:18.710 --> 16:19.750

a little while.

We were talking today...
Is Breena all right?

16:44.150 --> 16:45.350
I don't know.
Doesn't that hurt?

16:45.550 --> 16:46.990
I just want to make sure
that everything's all right
No.

there with you.
Can you call me, please?

16:49.430 --> 16:51.630
Uh, at County as soon
as you get this. Thank you.

16:51.630 --> 16:53.509
Is his arm going
to be OK?

16:53.509 --> 16:55.469
Yeah, I gave
him a nerve block.
He can't feel a thing.

16:55.669 --> 16:57.589
Now, you're going to need
surgery on that wrist.

16:57.669 --> 16:58.709
For real?

16:58.869 --> 17:01.309
You weren't at home
when this happened?

17:01.469 --> 17:03.469

I got a pigeon coop up there.

Well, that's a good
time to have a hobby.

about this guy, right?

first, please?

17:18.029 --> 17:19.148
All right, someone
find her son.

17:19.309 --> 17:20.949
Does it strike anyone else
as strange that she can

17:21.108 --> 17:22.829
hardly breathe, but her SATS
are a hundred percent?

17:22.949 --> 17:24.348
Grady, put her
on a hundred percent O2.

All right, Dr Carter, get your
patient on a hundred percent O2.

He has carbon
monoxide poisoning.
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

17:33.749 --> 17:35.709

17:35.869 --> 17:37.429

for a carbon monoxide level?

17:37.629 --> 17:38.589
Doing it right now.
All right, would you

17:38.749 --> 17:40.189
feel better if Dr Morris
took over in here?

17:40.349 --> 17:41.669
All right, lift your leg.
What?

17:41.829 --> 17:43.109
You've been out a long time.
Come on, Norman, move your foot.

17:43.269 --> 17:44.469
I know how that is, but
this patient is sick...

17:44.669 --> 17:45.909
Wiggle your toes for me.
I know what he needs.

17:46.069 --> 17:48.549
All right, I want you to be
comfortable.

17:48.709 --> 17:49.789
I'm comfortable.
Norman, wiggle your toes.

17:49.949 --> 17:51.269
Norman?
They won't!

What won't?

and get him up to the OR.

We're going
to the hyperbaric chamber.

18:21.869 --> 18:23.549
What?
We've got to get
some oxygen to his brain.

18:23.709 --> 18:25.349
No, neurosurge needs
to get in there now.

I'd rather be paralyzed than
brain damaged, how about you?

could bleed out in the chamber.

after the decompression.

18:34.548 --> 18:35.548
with Solu-medrol
before we take him in.

No, Solu-medrol is no longer...
Shut up, Gates.

18:37.348 --> 18:39.228
I know the debate.
Dr Carter,
with all due respect,

18:39.388 --> 18:40.748
the decision whether
a patient needs surgery or not

18:40.908 --> 18:42.348
needs to be left
up to the surgeon.

18:42.428 --> 18:43.988
Neela, with equal due respect,

18:43.988 --> 18:45.508
I remember what it was
like to be you.

18:45.628 --> 18:46.668
To be me?

18:46.828 --> 18:48.068
When you're
a surgical intern,

18:48.228 --> 18:49.388
you feel like
surgeons are the only

18:49.508 --> 18:50.828
real doctors
in the hospital.

18:51.028 --> 18:52.948
But that approach
to a patient can
be a little narrow.

18:53.068 --> 18:54.028
I am not an intern.

his brain is

19:30.948 --> 19:32.708
Decompensated on a flight.

19:32.708 --> 19:34.308
Hey, I'm sorry.
The home wouldn't take her

19:34.468 --> 19:36.108
without getting checked out
first, so...

19:36.268 --> 19:37.748
Who's this?
Sam's mother.

19:37.908 --> 19:40.388
She's tachypneic in the 30s
and has a left hemiparesis.

19:40.508 --> 19:41.348
Yeah, that's her baseline.

19:41.468 --> 19:42.548
She had a stroke
a few months ago.

19:42.708 --> 19:44.068
All right, I'll take this.
Exam two.

19:48.628 --> 19:50.188
Ready for the thora-seal.

19:50.428 --> 19:52.508
Another unit,
type specific.
FFP and platelets.

19:52.668 --> 19:55.148
And let surgery know we
have a potential customer.

19:55.148 --> 19:56.428
OK, duly noted.

19:56.428 --> 19:57.868
Grade-two liver lac

19:58.028 --> 19:59.748
and pulmonary contusions.
We're going to try to stay ahead

19:59.868 --> 20:00.988
of the blood loss,
so she can

20:01.148 --> 20:02.388
avoid OR.
Sounds like a good plan.

20:02.508 --> 20:04.588
How is her carbon
monoxide level?

20:04.588 --> 20:05.788
29%, but she's not

20:05.788 --> 20:07.188
stable enough
for hyperbaric.
Exactly.

20:07.388 --> 20:08.508
Neither is
Carter's patient.

20:08.668 --> 20:09.748
So can you please
explain to me

20:09.908 --> 20:11.147
why he won't
listen to reason?

20:11.267 --> 20:14.067
ALARM BEEPS

20:14.187 --> 20:15.987
400cc out of the chest tube.

20:16.107 --> 20:17.427
All right,
get the rapid infuser.

20:17.587 --> 20:19.267
Sometimes reason
doesn't get you anywhere.

20:19.387 --> 20:20.467
Excuse me?

20:20.627 --> 20:22.507
We have four kids who
could be orphaned

20:22.667 --> 20:24.027
despite all
reasonable efforts.

20:24.147 --> 20:25.627
You know, it's part of the deal.

20:25.747 --> 20:27.387
Doesn't mean we can
start abandoning protocol.

20:27.507 --> 20:28.667
Carter was out in the field.

20:28.827 --> 20:30.067
Without all
that technology,

20:30.147 --> 20:31.347
you learn to listen to your gut.

20:31.347 --> 20:32.987
Systolic's down to 82.

20:33.067 --> 20:34.507
Can't say I blame him.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.067
Looks like reason's
having a bad day.

20:39.027 --> 20:39.947
He's hypoventilating.

20:40.107 --> 20:41.787
Are you sure you
don't want to tube him?

20:41.787 --> 20:43.027
No, he'll wake up
in the chamber.

20:44.627 --> 20:45.827
Why did you roll
over on this?

20:45.947 --> 20:47.827
Oh, something about
"reason having a bad day."

20:48.027 --> 20:49.987
But this robs him of
any meaningful chance
of walking again.

20:50.187 --> 20:51.307
OK, you're being
very dramatic.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.227
Well, ask any neurosurgeon.
We're making a mistake.

20:53.227 --> 20:55.987
OK, neurosurgeons are biased.
And by the way, so are we.

20:56.147 --> 20:57.747
We see every case
through the haze

20:57.907 --> 20:59.787
of our own experience,
our own expertise.

20:59.947 --> 21:03.147
Sometimes a fresh set
of eyes is a valuable thing.

21:04.427 --> 21:05.987
This is crap.

21:06.147 --> 21:07.787
Hey. You OK?

21:07.947 --> 21:09.827
No. I'm having a horrible
day, and we're totally

21:10.027 --> 21:12.387
blowing this case
which nobody seems to...
Frank, any messages for me?

21:12.547 --> 21:14.427
Nothing.

21:14.587 --> 21:16.227
You were saying?
Oh, never mind.

21:16.307 --> 21:17.427
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21:17.587 --> 21:18.547
I'm listening, really.
No, it's all right.

21:18.707 --> 21:20.267
Hi, Neela. Hi, Simon.
Hey.

21:22.147 --> 21:24.027
Time to go.
OK. I'll walk her out.

21:24.147 --> 21:25.147
OK, I'll see you later.

21:25.267 --> 21:26.387
Bye.

21:26.387 --> 21:27.427
Bye.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.787
When can I live
with my mom again?

21:31.947 --> 21:33.547
Well, that depends
on a lot of stuff.

21:33.747 --> 21:35.467
I don't like
living there.

21:35.587 --> 21:37.187
I don't feel comfortable.

21:38.747 --> 21:41.227
Well, it's not going to be
for much longer, OK?
OK.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.147
Hey, Lucy.
How's she doing today?

21:43.267 --> 21:45.147
The same.

21:48.427 --> 21:49.467
Hi.

21:49.467 --> 21:50.866
Mrs Griswold,
can I have a word?

21:50.946 --> 21:52.506
Uh, it's Dr Brenner, right?

21:52.666 --> 21:54.666
Yeah.
Well, I've got
to get her to school,

21:54.826 --> 21:57.146
and drop off my little
one at her grandma's,

21:57.226 --> 21:58.866
then be at work by eleven.

21:58.866 --> 22:00.986
I'm, uh, curious.
How it's going?

22:01.106 --> 22:02.346
Excuse me?

22:02.466 --> 22:04.026
At home with Lucy?

22:04.146 --> 22:06.506
Did she say something?

22:06.666 --> 22:09.106
She seems a little
uncomfortable...

22:09.106 --> 22:10.466
with Stan.

22:10.586 --> 22:12.386
I tried ringing, but...
Oh, oh...

22:12.546 --> 22:13.466
Everyone's uncomfortable
with Stan.

22:13.626 --> 22:14.946
Look, he's my husband
and I love him,

22:15.066 --> 22:16.026
but he's weird, OK?

22:16.186 --> 22:18.626
"Weird" is not
a qualification for being

22:18.746 --> 22:21.346
a foster parent.

22:21.346 --> 22:22.826
We got two of our own

22:22.986 --> 22:24.306
and three foster
kids in our apartment.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.346
He's great with them.

22:25.546 --> 22:26.746
It's me he's not
so great with.

22:26.866 --> 22:28.066
Laid off in October,

22:28.226 --> 22:30.186
and he still won't get
off his ass and find a job.

22:30.306 --> 22:31.706
Look, I really got to get going.

22:35.346 --> 22:36.746
KELLY: Yeah, she was
fine at first.

22:36.906 --> 22:39.346
Then she started having
trouble breathing

22:39.466 --> 22:40.666
and not making any sense.

22:40.786 --> 22:43.066
I wouldn't even
recognise her.

22:43.186 --> 22:44.626
Yeah, well, it's
been a really long time.

22:44.746 --> 22:46.066
Yeah, it's hard to believe

22:46.226 --> 22:48.546
how easy it can be
just to shut stuff off.

22:49.826 --> 22:52.106
Looks like your mom has
right middle lobe pneumonia.

22:53.146 --> 22:54.186
IV antibiotics?

22:54.346 --> 22:55.906
Yeah, but her SATS
aren't too bad, though.

22:56.026 --> 22:56.946
What does that mean?

22:57.066 --> 22:58.946
It means, uh, we can
probably buff her up

22:58.946 --> 23:00.706
and she'll be back
in the nursing home
in a few hours.

23:00.866 --> 23:04.386
That's good. She's going to be more
comfortable there.

23:05.826 --> 23:07.786
I've got to go
change my flight.

23:07.946 --> 23:09.786
Can I use the phone
at the desk?
GATES: Use the break room.

23:09.906 --> 23:12.106
You remember where that is?
Yes.

23:12.226 --> 23:13.426
MARY COUGHS

23:14.906 --> 23:16.186
Looks like the O2 is working.

23:17.506 --> 23:19.386
Yeah, she'll be
coming around.

23:23.586 --> 23:25.746
I don't even know
what to say to her.

23:25.906 --> 23:27.146
Oh, I'm sure you'll
figure it out.

23:27.266 --> 23:29.866
Yeah, I just hope it's
not something like, uh,

23:29.866 --> 23:32.705
"Why did you have
to be such a crappy mom?"

23:32.865 --> 23:35.025
Or "Why couldn't you
just stay in Dallas and die?"

23:35.225 --> 23:37.505
Oh, I'm guessing
you'll come up with
something better.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.705
Where is my...?

23:46.705 --> 23:47.865
What's going on?

23:47.985 --> 23:50.585
What's...going on?

23:50.705 --> 23:52.545
Hi, Mom.

23:53.905 --> 23:56.465
It's me, Sammy.

23:56.585 --> 23:58.425
You're in Chicago.

23:58.545 --> 23:59.705
Where?

24:01.105 --> 24:02.905
At the hospital where I work.

24:04.865 --> 24:06.265
You're a nurse?

24:08.905 --> 24:11.665
Yeah. Sammy.

24:11.785 --> 24:13.945
Sammy...

24:15.505 --> 24:16.745
Sammy.

24:16.745 --> 24:19.585
Sammy. Sammy?

24:24.305 --> 24:26.545
I'm sorry that
it's been so long.

24:28.505 --> 24:30.865
Do I...do I know you?

24:30.865 --> 24:32.945
Have we met before?

24:34.345 --> 24:36.545
MARY COUGHS

24:49.705 --> 24:51.185
MARY MOANS

25:59.984 --> 26:01.984
MUSIC THROUGHOUT

26:03.224 --> 26:05.864
Wouldn't it be nice to put things
right when they go wrong?

26:06.824 --> 26:09.464
Well, when it comes to
diarrhoea, you can... fast.

26:09.944 --> 26:13.304
Imodium Instants' unique format
dissolves instantly on your tongue...

26:13.504 --> 26:15.704
..so you can be free
from diarrhoea all day.

26:20.344 --> 26:23.264
Eating the same low fat breakfast
every day

26:23.264 --> 26:25.184
can be hard work.

26:25.624 --> 26:28.344
That's why Special K
now has 10 varieties.

26:30.304 --> 26:32.624
And as we all know,
a girl needs variety

26:32.624 --> 26:34.104
to look good.

26:46.584 --> 26:48.224
Now with...

27:09.503 --> 27:11.183
I love changing my hair colour,

27:11.303 --> 27:12.983
but I'll never change
its protection

27:13.103 --> 27:14.943
since I've discovered
Colour Protect.

27:19.823 --> 27:21.383
Our double-action technology...

27:23.583 --> 27:25.423
for light-reflecting shine.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.263
Every day your coloured hair
is protected,

27:30.343 --> 27:31.943
its radiance reflected.

27:34.623 --> 27:37.263
For me, it's the best care
for coloured hair.

27:37.343 --> 27:38.183
Because you're worth it.

27:51.863 --> 27:54.783
Just imagine how big
things would have to be

27:54.783 --> 27:56.663
to last 8 weeks.

27:56.663 --> 27:58.743
And imagine what they would cost.

27:59.783 --> 28:01.183
One bottle of new Fairy

28:01.183 --> 28:03.983
can last up to an amazing 8 weeks.

28:13.183 --> 28:16.343
Bring out your Italian side tonight

28:16.423 --> 28:19.263
and share spaghetti and meatballs

28:19.343 --> 28:22.263
drenched in tomato and herb sauce.

28:23.063 --> 28:25.543
Catch up with friends and family.

28:25.663 --> 28:28.903
Tear off some garlic bread
and pass around the salad.

28:29.742 --> 28:32.182
A traditional Italian meal for four.

28:32.262 --> 28:34.022
Just:

28:36.182 --> 28:37.942
Good with food.

28:39.582 --> 28:42.702
Guess who's won
a Product of the Year award!

28:42.702 --> 28:44.582
Pringles Select!

28:46.062 --> 28:49.862
Voted No.1 New Snack 2009.

28:49.862 --> 28:53.022
So join the party
and start celebrating.

28:54.702 --> 28:58.742
With delicious flavours
like Sea Salt and Balsamic Vinegar

28:58.742 --> 29:00.742
or Thai Sweet Chilli

29:02.262 --> 29:04.062
Pringles Select

29:04.062 --> 29:07.182
Bag yourself
an award-winningly posh Pringle

30:09.981 --> 30:11.501
Thanks for waiting.

30:11.501 --> 30:12.701
You know,
we can do this inside.

30:12.861 --> 30:15.021
I need my nicotine fix anyway,
and the baby's sleeping.

30:15.141 --> 30:16.821
Got to take
the trash out.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.901
I left a, uh,
message for you

30:19.021 --> 30:20.101
on your answering machine.

30:20.261 --> 30:21.861
Yeah, I don't know how
to work that thing.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.461
My wife's the one
who checks it.

30:23.461 --> 30:24.941
Right, well, I was just,
uh, wondering

30:25.061 --> 30:26.661
how it's all going with Lucy.

30:28.821 --> 30:30.341
She's a good kid.

30:30.501 --> 30:31.581
Been through a lot.

30:32.621 --> 30:34.701
Well, she, um...

30:34.861 --> 30:37.141
she says she feels
uncomfortable here.

30:39.221 --> 30:40.661
That's natural, right?

30:40.821 --> 30:42.621
I mean, new place,
new people.

30:42.781 --> 30:44.861
And she is a little
bit of an odd duck.

30:44.981 --> 30:46.021
They're always
my favourites.

30:46.181 --> 30:47.901
Not the most adaptable,
but in the end...

30:48.061 --> 30:50.781
She says you make her feel,
uh, uncomfortable.

30:53.021 --> 30:54.981
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

30:55.141 --> 30:57.861
Look... I got
a really narrow tolerance

30:57.941 --> 30:59.061
for the way people treat kids.

30:59.141 --> 31:00.981
That's a personal foible of mine.

31:01.101 --> 31:02.461
What the hell is a foible?

31:02.461 --> 31:04.861
Are you crossing the line
with her?

31:07.501 --> 31:09.261
Did you come here for this?

31:09.421 --> 31:12.141
My wife and I love
these kids - all of them.

31:12.341 --> 31:13.901
You're gonna stand there
and accuse me of some...

31:14.021 --> 31:15.941
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

31:16.061 --> 31:17.181
Just stop...
stop talking!

31:18.341 --> 31:20.181
Listen, I don't know
what's wrong with you,

31:20.301 --> 31:21.781
if you're nuts or you just

31:21.901 --> 31:23.381
got the wrong
idea somehow.

31:24.901 --> 31:26.461
You walk around naked.

31:26.581 --> 31:27.461
What?

31:27.581 --> 31:29.461
Oh, is she lying, is she?

31:29.461 --> 31:30.701
Is she lying?

31:30.781 --> 31:33.301
She came home early one day.

31:33.421 --> 31:36.221
I got out of the shower
in my towel.

31:36.381 --> 31:37.541
I'm not some
pervert, man.

31:37.541 --> 31:39.461
I'm not some freak.

31:39.621 --> 31:41.461
What, you think
I get off on kids?

31:41.581 --> 31:43.621
Is that what
you think?

31:46.821 --> 31:49.301
I'm sorry.

31:49.301 --> 31:50.460
Look...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31:50.620 --> 31:51.940
We don't have
a lot of dough.

31:52.140 --> 31:54.340
I'm sorry.
And maybe I look
like a loser to you,

31:54.500 --> 31:56.660
but I don't need some rich
doctor coming in here

31:56.820 --> 31:58.300
accusing me of
terrible things

31:58.300 --> 32:00.780
that I would
never, never do.

32:04.380 --> 32:05.820
They spiked your soda?

32:05.980 --> 32:07.460
It was like a diuretic
or something.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.420
And nailed up a stuffed animal
by your desk?

32:09.540 --> 32:11.420
It's hazing.
It'll stop eventually.

32:11.620 --> 32:13.660
You don't think this
has anything to do
with what happened?

32:13.820 --> 32:15.620
Same difference. Either way,
I'm going to ride it out.

32:15.820 --> 32:17.460
If this goes
on too long...
Yeah, I know.

32:17.580 --> 32:19.100
I got to stop it,
but this time

32:19.260 --> 32:20.300
I'll deal with it, OK?
OK.

32:20.460 --> 32:21.940
I can take care of myself,
Archie, really.

32:22.060 --> 32:24.260
I know.

32:24.420 --> 32:27.380
I got to admit, I do like
that you worry about me.

32:29.540 --> 32:31.860
And here's my partner
to pick me up.

32:33.180 --> 32:34.820
Archie, this
is my new partner,

32:34.940 --> 32:35.860
Ed Bernstein.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.100
Archie Morris.
Nice to meet you.

32:37.260 --> 32:38.860
I hear you're looking
out for her.

32:38.860 --> 32:40.380
She looks out for herself.

32:40.540 --> 32:43.300
I'll be right back -
I left my phone inside.

32:44.300 --> 32:45.860
You're the doctor friend, huh?

32:46.020 --> 32:48.740
Yep, the outfit gives me away
every time.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.100
How long you been on the job?

32:54.220 --> 32:56.820
Been in HGS almost 15 years.

32:56.820 --> 32:59.340
Oh, you can show her the ropes,
you know, back her up.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.020
Cops take care
of each other, doc.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.260
You know that.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.780
Let's get out of here.

33:03.860 --> 33:04.700
Sure thing.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.100
See you later, Archie.
Bye.

33:06.220 --> 33:07.300
Thanks for the coffee.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.340
Mm-hm.

33:11.940 --> 33:13.700
BURT:
No, no, it's
still blinking.

33:13.860 --> 33:15.820
Come on, Burt,
live a little.

33:18.460 --> 33:21.100
Come on, come
on, come on!

33:21.100 --> 33:22.900
Guys.

33:22.900 --> 33:23.940
Guys!

33:23.940 --> 33:25.500
Burt, watch out!
BURT SCREAMS

33:25.500 --> 33:27.540
THUD!

33:27.540 --> 33:28.780
Brenner called,
said he's not

33:28.940 --> 33:31.339
feeling well, gave his
pass-ons to Gates.

33:31.499 --> 33:33.859
I just love how
this place runs itself.

33:33.979 --> 33:34.819
BURT SCREAMS

33:34.939 --> 33:35.779
TILDIE: It's OK, Burt.

33:35.899 --> 33:38.259
I got hit by a moped, Tildie.

33:38.419 --> 33:40.179
But it was exciting,
risky, daring.

33:40.299 --> 33:42.099
I'll take them into three
and call an ortho consult.

33:42.259 --> 33:43.379
Please do.

33:43.499 --> 33:44.699
He'll be all
right, won't he?

33:44.859 --> 33:47.259
Yes, but you two really have
to get control of yourselves.

33:47.259 --> 33:49.859
You're the one who said
to tear the mattress tag.

33:50.859 --> 33:52.019
Tear the what?

33:52.019 --> 33:53.219
No, it was
a metaphor

33:53.339 --> 33:55.379
for living fully,
taking chances.

33:55.499 --> 33:57.299
A metaphor?

33:57.459 --> 33:59.099
Why didn't you tell me
she was so altered?

33:59.259 --> 34:01.179
Well, she's not always
like this, you know.

34:01.339 --> 34:02.619
When she's home and
everything's OK,

34:02.779 --> 34:04.219
she's pretty
clear, but...

34:04.219 --> 34:06.459
the plane just really
tipped her over.

34:06.659 --> 34:08.099
All right, well, she
can stay here tonight,

34:08.219 --> 34:09.859
and then we'll
move her tomorrow.

34:10.018 --> 34:11.339
You can stay with me,
if you want.

34:12.379 --> 34:13.739
Uh, actually, I... I can't,

34:13.859 --> 34:15.819
but I'll check in with
you when I get to Tokyo.

34:15.938 --> 34:16.779
What? You're going?

34:16.899 --> 34:18.458
Sammy, I have to. I...

34:18.579 --> 34:19.619
No, you said you were gonna stay

34:19.739 --> 34:21.659
until we got her settled
into the nursing home.

34:21.779 --> 34:23.619
I can't, Sammy.

34:26.859 --> 34:28.619
Look, this is...

34:28.619 --> 34:29.779
this is hard.

34:31.458 --> 34:33.099
I know it's
probably more

34:33.259 --> 34:34.179
than she
deserves.

34:36.299 --> 34:37.699
Thank you.

34:41.819 --> 34:43.579
FFP's in.
Order more from
the blood bank.

34:43.739 --> 34:44.819
360.
Clear!

34:44.978 --> 34:46.539
I heard you could
use a little help in here.

34:46.659 --> 34:48.179
Nah, we're good.

34:48.339 --> 34:50.099
You sure?
Clear!

34:51.099 --> 34:52.059
DAWN: Still in v-tach.

34:52.059 --> 34:53.299
Resuming compressions.

34:53.498 --> 34:54.739
Another unit,
type specific.

34:54.938 --> 34:56.339
Liver lac must've
opened up.
She needs the OR.

34:56.458 --> 34:57.819
Well, yeah, that's a good idea,

34:57.819 --> 35:00.059
but she goes into v-tach
every time we try to move her.

35:00.179 --> 35:02.019
James, do you understand
what's going on?

35:02.139 --> 35:03.379
Is she going to die?

35:03.539 --> 35:05.539
What are you doing?
If we find the source

35:05.659 --> 35:07.259
of the bleeding,
she's got a shot.

35:07.259 --> 35:09.019
What, are you going to do
an ex-lap right here?

35:09.179 --> 35:10.138
No, he's not.
Surgeons come to camp

35:10.298 --> 35:11.698
once a week,
the rest of the time,

35:11.818 --> 35:13.018
we're on our own.

35:13.098 --> 35:15.858
Ten blade.

35:16.058 --> 35:17.338
I don't understand.
You're going to cut her open?

35:17.498 --> 35:18.938
I'm going to pack off the liver
and try and control

35:19.058 --> 35:22.258
some of this bleeding, and
buy us a little bit of time.

35:22.258 --> 35:23.178
Tell me about your mom.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.298
Tell me something
she likes.

35:24.378 --> 35:25.578
The beach.

35:25.738 --> 35:27.058
She likes to go swimming.
OK, hold her hand,

35:27.178 --> 35:29.418
and pretend that's
where you are.

35:29.538 --> 35:31.338
Thirteenth unit's up.
Lucky 13.

35:31.498 --> 35:33.178
Gates, switch out, get sterile.
I'm going to need an assistant.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.618
You heard him.

35:34.778 --> 35:36.858
Come on.

35:37.018 --> 35:38.298
GATES:
Do you think we should tell

35:38.298 --> 35:39.858
Surgery we're doing
this at least?

35:39.858 --> 35:41.018
No.

35:41.858 --> 35:45.178
Hey, how is Mrs D
and the kids doing?

35:46.338 --> 35:48.138
I'll try and get
an update for you.

35:48.258 --> 35:49.498
Hang in there, Norman.

35:54.138 --> 35:55.578
You know, when
you're an attending,

35:55.738 --> 35:56.578
you'll get it.

35:56.698 --> 35:58.018
Get what?

35:58.018 --> 36:00.058
How the subtle
administrative,
political nuances

36:00.218 --> 36:01.498
become a big part
of your job.

36:01.618 --> 36:03.098
I don't get how
you can let that

36:03.218 --> 36:04.698
trump the care of
an actual patient.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.178
You know, the right
course of action was,

36:06.298 --> 36:07.698
frankly, a little unclear.

36:07.818 --> 36:09.058
He has a spinal
fracture and paralysis.

36:09.218 --> 36:10.578
Seems pretty clear
he needs the OR.

36:10.658 --> 36:11.738
We'll see.

36:11.858 --> 36:13.178
You never take my
opinion seriously.

36:13.378 --> 36:15.178
That's not true.
You don't view me
as an equal.

36:15.338 --> 36:16.818
I have 15 years
of experience on you,

36:16.898 --> 36:17.858
so, actually, no, I don't.

36:18.018 --> 36:19.018
And how's that ever
going to change?

36:19.098 --> 36:20.058
You know, Neela, you...

36:20.178 --> 36:21.698
You might want
to call neurosurge.

36:21.818 --> 36:23.418
He is moving his toes.

36:39.658 --> 36:40.938
What you did in there...

36:41.058 --> 36:42.578
It had a really
good chance of working.

36:42.698 --> 36:44.618
It did, so spare me.

36:44.738 --> 36:46.258
It was smart and gutsy.

36:47.258 --> 36:48.938
I thought she was going
to make it.

36:51.817 --> 36:53.577
Well, "almost" doesn't
really count, does it?

36:53.697 --> 36:55.657
Your guy in the hyperbaric
chamber is moving his legs.

36:55.817 --> 36:57.577
Really?
Mm-hm.

36:57.577 --> 36:58.937
Neurosurgery's up there now.

36:59.097 --> 37:00.697
All right, would you
tell her I'm upstairs

37:00.817 --> 37:01.817
if she's looking for me?

37:01.937 --> 37:03.297
Thank you.

37:03.297 --> 37:05.897
You know, this has been
one incredibly weird day.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.977
Well, I read
in the paper that

37:08.097 --> 37:11.337
Mars is transitioning
from Capricorn to Aquarius.

37:11.537 --> 37:12.537
That must be it.
Yeah.

37:12.697 --> 37:14.537
Blast injuries can force
air from the lungs

37:14.657 --> 37:16.257
into the bloodstream.
An embolus is likely

37:16.377 --> 37:18.777
lodged in his spinal cord,
causing transient paralysis.

37:18.937 --> 37:19.977
And the chamber
shrank the embolus?

37:20.097 --> 37:21.777
Well, it forced it into
solution, where it was

37:21.897 --> 37:23.257
carried back to the lungs.
So you all think

37:23.417 --> 37:24.417
the spinal fracture
is stable,

37:24.497 --> 37:25.697
no chance of cord injury?

37:25.817 --> 37:27.777
It's too soon to know for sure.
We need to have a look.

37:27.937 --> 37:29.337
Call me when you
get to the unit.

37:29.457 --> 37:30.537
You got it.

37:30.657 --> 37:32.697
Yes! Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes!

37:32.857 --> 37:34.337
Am I done?
You ready to come out of there?

37:34.457 --> 37:36.577
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Please. Man...

37:36.777 --> 37:39.137
Ow.
This is like the pod from
the Planet Of The Apes,

37:39.257 --> 37:41.057
the original one.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.937
You're a very lucky man,
Mr Chapman.

37:43.097 --> 37:45.577
That's what I've been
trying to tell you!

37:45.697 --> 37:47.737
I am indestructible.

37:47.737 --> 37:49.577
Hey, how is Mrs D
and the kids doing?

37:49.697 --> 37:51.497
The kids are stable.

37:51.657 --> 37:53.577
They've all been admitted,
but Mrs Dixon had

37:53.777 --> 37:55.777
very serious injuries
to her liver and spleen.

37:55.897 --> 37:57.457
She died.

37:57.577 --> 37:59.537
What?

37:59.657 --> 38:01.177
We did everything
that we possibly could,

38:01.337 --> 38:02.657
but we couldn't control
the bleeding.

38:02.817 --> 38:04.777
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I don't believe it.

38:04.777 --> 38:06.377
Mrs D can't be dead.

38:06.497 --> 38:07.377
That doesn't
make any sense.

38:07.537 --> 38:08.537
BANFIELD:
You saved those children,

38:08.537 --> 38:09.977
Norman, don't forget that.

38:10.137 --> 38:12.217
We have to take
you to the OR now,

38:12.377 --> 38:14.177
make sure you're
not bleeding internally.

38:16.697 --> 38:18.537
Oh, God.
This last year was like

38:18.737 --> 38:20.657
being under a magic spell
or something.

38:20.777 --> 38:22.737
I guess I got
kind of hooked on it.

38:22.897 --> 38:24.457
But I guess
it's pretty much over now.

38:24.577 --> 38:26.617
What's over?

38:26.617 --> 38:28.657
The era where everything
works out.

39:05.376 --> 39:06.896
Come on. He's on in a minute.

39:07.016 --> 39:08.616
- Have you had your hair done, Lisa?
- No.

39:08.736 --> 39:11.336
Right, guys. Roast chicken with
couscous, and for less than a fiver.

39:11.416 --> 39:13.056
Chop some red onion, garlic.

39:13.176 --> 39:15.016
Just add this to the chicken.
Bang that in the oven.

39:15.136 --> 39:17.296
Right, who wants
to help me with the couscous?

39:17.416 --> 39:19.376
Cooks in literally
two or three minutes.

39:19.456 --> 39:20.896
Is that your mate over there? Hello.

39:21.016 --> 39:22.616
Courgette.
APPLAUSE

39:22.736 --> 39:24.616
Have a look at that!
Absolutely beautiful.

39:24.736 --> 39:26.416
Sainsbury's Freedom Food
endorsed chicken

39:26.496 --> 39:29.136
reared to RSPCA welfare standards.

39:29.256 --> 39:31.296
- Any good?
- Mm. Lovely!

39:31.416 --> 39:33.136
- Had your hair done?
- Yes.

39:56.096 --> 39:57.416
It's very simple.

39:57.536 --> 40:00.176
Four fixed wheels
like to go in straight lines,

40:00.296 --> 40:02.696
whereas a ball
can move in any direction.

40:02.776 --> 40:04.656
So a clear choice -

40:04.736 --> 40:06.696
easy turns with minimal effort,

40:06.776 --> 40:09.496
or do it the old-fashioned way.

40:14.495 --> 40:15.335
Look!

40:15.415 --> 40:17.535
This colour's perfect.

40:17.655 --> 40:18.495
Your
dress?

40:18.615 --> 40:19.935
No,
my hair!

40:20.015 --> 40:21.135
It's:

40:23.175 --> 40:26.135
My colour stays looking so rich!

40:26.215 --> 40:27.415
Will it do my bit of grey?

40:27.535 --> 40:28.775
All
your grey!

40:28.895 --> 40:30.175
Garnier
Nutrisse Cream.

40:30.295 --> 40:31.855
Nourished hair,
better colour.

40:33.535 --> 40:34.495
The nation's voted for

40:34.575 --> 40:35.935
their favourite Nutrisse shade.

40:36.055 --> 40:37.175
The shade of
the nation is...

40:37.255 --> 40:38.015
Ta-da!

40:38.135 --> 40:39.295
Light Mahogany
Chestnut.

40:39.415 --> 40:40.975
No wonder it's the
nation's favourite.

40:41.095 --> 40:43.055
It's my favourite,
too.

40:45.135 --> 40:47.535

41:47.535 --> 41:49.535
# I want you to be there

41:50.015 --> 41:52.214
The bright sunny fragrance
of new Bold 2 in 1

41:52.214 --> 41:54.494
Sparkling Pomegranate
and Orange Blossom

41:55.894 --> 41:57.854
Bring on the summer!

41:59.054 --> 42:01.414
Bursting with fragrance
with a built-in fabric softener

43:25.814 --> 43:27.334
Brenner was supposed
to do it before he left
and never got to it.

43:27.894 --> 43:28.774
What happened
to him anyway?

43:28.854 --> 43:29.973
Went home sick.

43:30.173 --> 43:32.093
Seemed fine
this morning.
Hello, everybody.

43:32.093 --> 43:33.213
You're here already?

43:33.293 --> 43:34.493
I don't get off till seven.

43:34.653 --> 43:36.693
I know, but my hand's
feeling a little
worse for wear.

43:36.893 --> 43:38.133
I thought someone
could take a look at it.

43:38.213 --> 43:40.093
Yeah, let me see.

43:42.293 --> 43:44.333
Please, ignore
my advice.

43:44.493 --> 43:45.973
OK, you were doing
fine without me.

43:46.093 --> 43:48.653
Just don't rely too much
on the GPS system, OK?

43:48.653 --> 43:50.213
OK.
So no more running
with scissors?

43:50.333 --> 43:51.293
I think not.

43:51.493 --> 43:53.373
No more sex on the...
Definitely not.

43:53.533 --> 43:55.213
Oh...

43:55.333 --> 43:57.213
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

43:59.253 --> 44:00.933
Wow. I feel like I just
drowned their puppy.

44:01.093 --> 44:02.373
That's what you get
for telling them

44:02.493 --> 44:03.973
to tear the tags off mattresses.

44:04.133 --> 44:05.933
Grady, would you set my husband
up in curtain two?

44:06.093 --> 44:07.493
We might have to do
a hand series.

44:07.613 --> 44:08.653
Oh, sure thing,
Dr Banfield.

44:08.773 --> 44:10.173
Here. After you're done
with that, make sure

44:10.173 --> 44:11.613
you get to the other stuff,
cos I'm leaving soon.

44:11.733 --> 44:12.933
Right this way,
Mr Banfield.

44:12.933 --> 44:14.653
Russell's fine.
I'm not an old man.

44:14.853 --> 44:17.413
So, uh, how's it going
with the cop?

44:17.493 --> 44:18.813
Good. Very good.

44:18.813 --> 44:20.933
In fact, I kind of want things
to move forward,

44:21.053 --> 44:22.133
but I'm not sure how.

44:22.293 --> 44:23.573
You know what I just did

44:23.733 --> 44:25.973
for the old lady as
a romantic gesture?

44:25.973 --> 44:27.653
Adjoining burial sites.

44:27.653 --> 44:29.133
She cried and cried.

44:29.253 --> 44:31.133
I'll keep that in mind, Frank.

44:32.333 --> 44:33.933
How does, uh, Claudia
feel about things?

44:34.093 --> 44:35.213
I'm not sure.
I can't tell.

44:35.373 --> 44:36.933
So it's making me
a little nervous.

44:37.093 --> 44:39.333
You know, I don't like
to get into all this

44:39.493 --> 44:41.413
personal stuff you
people drag around here,

44:41.573 --> 44:43.533
but, uh, I'm going to offer
you a bit of wisdom

44:43.733 --> 44:45.573
I heard on the
street, Dr Morris.

44:45.573 --> 44:48.853
Sometimes, you've just got
to cut the mattress tag.

44:48.973 --> 44:50.373
Mattress tags?

44:50.373 --> 44:52.773
I'm telling you -
Dan and Rose's shared plots

44:52.893 --> 44:54.413
and cremation urns.

44:54.573 --> 44:56.693
I got the number
in my phone.

45:11.412 --> 45:12.972
Well, I suppose
I could tell you

45:13.092 --> 45:14.772
that I cut myself
with a scalpel.

45:14.932 --> 45:16.452
Or that I slipped
in the snow.

45:16.612 --> 45:19.612
Or make up some other stupid
excuse, but why bother?

45:21.012 --> 45:23.492
A shunt.
Yeah. It's for dialysis.

45:23.652 --> 45:24.812
I had it revised
yesterday,

45:24.972 --> 45:26.612
but it seems to be
oozing a bit.

45:26.772 --> 45:29.332
I'd call that
more than a bit.

45:29.412 --> 45:31.052
Why are you on dialysis?

45:31.212 --> 45:33.772
Oh, bad luck, really.

45:33.772 --> 45:36.332
Some years ago, I lost function

45:36.332 --> 45:38.892
in my left kidney
after an incident here.

45:38.972 --> 45:40.812
I, uh...

45:40.932 --> 45:42.612
I got stabbed by a patient,

45:42.772 --> 45:44.812
and a med student
was killed.

45:45.012 --> 45:46.852
And then when I
was in Africa,

45:46.972 --> 45:48.372
I developed
amyloidosis,

45:48.532 --> 45:49.812
secondary to
schistosomiasis,

45:49.972 --> 45:51.612
which took care
of the other one.

45:51.732 --> 45:53.412
Wow. Well,
that is bad luck.

45:53.572 --> 45:55.972
Yeah. For a while, I
kind of had this idea

45:56.132 --> 45:57.852
that it would all
magically disappear,

45:57.852 --> 46:00.412
but a week in
a Nairobi hospital
cured me of that.

46:00.532 --> 46:01.772
Hmm.

46:01.892 --> 46:04.892
So, I need a kidney and
I came back to the States

46:04.892 --> 46:06.732
to get on the list.

46:09.012 --> 46:11.972
I'll, uh, keep
my fingers crossed.

46:13.972 --> 46:15.412
Well, actually,
as it turns out,

46:15.572 --> 46:17.412
you and I have
the same blood type

46:17.492 --> 46:18.852
and minor antigens group.

46:19.012 --> 46:21.012
Really?

46:21.132 --> 46:23.412
In fact, the truth is

46:23.532 --> 46:26.372
that I wanted to work here
so that I could meet you.

46:28.092 --> 46:30.252
And try to convince you

46:30.412 --> 46:32.732
to donate one
of your kidneys to me.

46:35.292 --> 46:37.492
What do you say?

46:37.612 --> 46:39.892
I'm just kidding.

46:39.892 --> 46:41.892
I have no idea
what blood type you are.

46:43.332 --> 46:45.812
Oh, so serious, Cate.

46:45.812 --> 46:46.892
Mm.

46:56.051 --> 46:59.011
You going to want to do
a resection or a primary repair?

46:59.011 --> 47:02.651
I don't know. Depends on what
we find when we get in there.
Right.

47:02.651 --> 47:04.651
Neela,

47:04.811 --> 47:07.491
you know the main reason
that you and I fight is

47:07.611 --> 47:10.451
that you're one of the
only people around here

47:10.611 --> 47:12.571
that I actually find
worthy of arguing with.

47:12.771 --> 47:14.891
I don't like
these new brushes.

47:15.051 --> 47:17.931
Which is another way of
saying that I respect you

47:18.091 --> 47:21.531
and look forward to working
together as colleagues.

47:21.691 --> 47:23.931

announcing appointments

47:24.011 --> 47:25.571
at the end of the week.

47:25.571 --> 47:27.491
I think you're going
to be very happy.

47:28.691 --> 47:33.531
Lucien, I've, um,
withdrawn my application.

47:33.691 --> 47:36.251
I'm not staying
at County.

47:43.611 --> 47:44.891
Hey.

47:44.971 --> 47:46.931
Hey.

47:49.531 --> 47:51.771
This morning
at the agency,

47:51.891 --> 47:54.171
I was acting crazy.

47:54.251 --> 47:55.851
Yeah, you and me both.

47:55.931 --> 47:57.891
No.

47:58.051 --> 47:59.891
You were just
defending my honour.

47:59.971 --> 48:01.291
Still...

48:01.411 --> 48:03.851
When was the last time
I hit a guy?

48:03.971 --> 48:05.851
(LAUGHS)

48:06.971 --> 48:09.251
Do you think our
erratic behaviour

48:09.251 --> 48:10.771
was some sort of sign?

48:10.851 --> 48:13.691
Sign of what?

48:13.891 --> 48:18.291
Maybe adoption isn't
the right thing for us.

48:18.411 --> 48:19.811
I don't know.

48:19.891 --> 48:22.411
No. Me, either.

48:22.571 --> 48:23.691
(SIGHS)
Hmm.

48:23.851 --> 48:26.931
Being there, thinking
about being a-a father again,

48:27.051 --> 48:28.571
what that would mean...

48:28.691 --> 48:29.731
Hmm.

48:29.890 --> 48:31.210
It was harder
than I thought.

48:31.330 --> 48:33.850
Well...

48:33.970 --> 48:35.930
Still, it-it doesn't mean

48:36.050 --> 48:37.850
that we shouldn't do it.

48:37.970 --> 48:39.890
It doesn't?

48:41.210 --> 48:43.410
Let's just sit
with it a while.

48:43.570 --> 48:45.530

down the line.

on your X-ray.

49:17.930 --> 49:20.050
Yeah. No, no.
Just-just a little bit.

49:20.050 --> 49:21.810
Well, where have you been?
I've been calling.

49:21.970 --> 49:24.770
Yeah, well, I had the ringer
on my phone turned down, so...

49:24.890 --> 49:27.330
Oh. Well, I bet my day
was worse than yours.

49:27.490 --> 49:29.770
Want to play the

49:29.890 --> 49:31.930
Boy, that sounds fun.

49:31.930 --> 49:34.770
I completely went out
on a limb against the ER,
all by myself,

49:34.770 --> 49:38.530
and Dubenko wouldn't back me up.
I mean, I knew I was right.

49:38.530 --> 49:40.770
I absolutely knew it,
and you know what?

49:41.530 --> 49:43.170
Turns out, I wasn't.

49:44.250 --> 49:47.130
Neela, just let it go.

49:47.130 --> 49:48.490
That's it?

49:48.650 --> 49:51.970

so, there's no point

49:52.130 --> 49:53.330
in getting
upset about it.

how about

this every time...

the things you want.

that's what
being together is.

50:22.969 --> 50:25.969

54:24.527 --> 54:27.167
# Shine

54:27.647 --> 54:33.127
# Mama's gonna buy you
a valentine. #

54:35.647 --> 54:38.887
I wish I had a daughter
like you.

54:47.887 --> 54:49.447
See you next time,
Dr Carter.

54:49.527 --> 54:50.567
See you then.

54:50.687 --> 54:51.767
Good job today.

54:51.927 --> 54:53.087
It's like
you never left.

54:53.207 --> 54:55.447
Almost.

57:01.085 --> 57:04.485
Now I'm in my 30s,
should I act more mature?

57:07.285 --> 57:08.845
Worry about how I look?

57:10.965 --> 57:14.045
Or let a little bladder weakness
slow me down?

57:14.885 --> 57:17.165
Not with Tena Lady Mini Magic

57:18.445 --> 57:22.605
Its discreet design absorbs the
thinner faster flow of a weak bladder

57:22.605 --> 57:26.245
So I feel free to keep life
just the way I want it

57:30.845 --> 57:32.325
Like, "Right, yeah.
Let's give that a go."

57:32.445 --> 57:33.565
My teeth
are sensitive.

57:33.685 --> 57:35.725
Sensodyne iso-active
is very different

57:35.845 --> 57:37.605
from anything else.
It's like a blue gel.

57:37.725 --> 57:39.365
You think, "OK. Yep.
That looks like a toothpaste."

57:39.445 --> 57:40.445
Then as you start using it,

57:40.565 --> 57:42.885
it goes into this
kind of frothy foaminess

57:43.005 --> 57:45.525
and you feel it moving
around your mouth straight away,

57:45.645 --> 57:47.405
going to areas that maybe
are harder to reach.

57:47.525 --> 57:48.405
You do feel
like you've got

57:48.485 --> 57:49.565
a breath of fresh air.

57:49.645 --> 57:51.085
The Sensodyne iso-active,

57:51.165 --> 57:52.205
it just ties it all up with a bow.

57:52.325 --> 57:54.285
It's like, "Right, where is this
product going wrong?" Nowhere.

57:54.405 --> 57:55.965
It gives me the protection
and you do want to do

57:56.085 --> 57:57.445
that running your tongue
across your teeth

57:57.525 --> 57:58.165
when you've finished.

58:10.365 --> 58:11.765
Big-name beers.

58:13.885 --> 58:14.885
That's a good case

58:14.965 --> 58:16.085
for coming to Tesco!

01:00:28.243 --> 01:00:33.043
Rebecca, hey. Look, I don't know
where you are,

01:00:33.043 --> 01:00:36.803
but if you're in LA, Kitty's birth
mother just had the baby at
St Francis,

01:00:36.803 --> 01:00:40.043
and, uh, I know Kitty would really
like it if you were here.

01:00:41.643 --> 01:00:45.323
Screw that. I want to see you.
I miss you.

01:00:49.643 --> 01:00:52.523
SIREN WAILS

01:01:00.803 --> 01:01:01.763
Clear the way!

01:01:02.963 --> 01:01:04.363
Robert McCallister, 44.

01:01:04.363 --> 01:01:07.003
Status post syncope, went down in
a parking garage.

01:01:07.003 --> 01:01:10.563
Complains of ongoing chest pain
despite morphine and
supplemental nitro.

01:01:10.563 --> 01:01:12.123
Pulse is 140 and thready.

01:01:24.563 --> 01:01:26.683
Clear this area, please.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:27.563
Did he get any aspirin?

01:01:27.563 --> 01:01:28.803
Yeah, I gave some earlier.

01:01:28.803 --> 01:01:31.283
And you are?
Brother-in-law. He had a headache.

01:01:31.283 --> 01:01:33.843
That's a lucky headache.
It probably saved his life.

01:01:33.843 --> 01:01:37.123
Let's order a CBC, chem panel,
enzymes, troponin
and call cardiology.

01:01:38.683 --> 01:01:39.803
Keep that mask on.

01:01:39.803 --> 01:01:40.883
Hey...

01:01:44.122 --> 01:01:45.362
We need to get outta here.

01:01:45.362 --> 01:01:46.602
Are you still feeling
any pain in your chest?

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:48.002
We need to get outta here.

01:01:48.002 --> 01:01:48.482
What's the pain like? Is it dull?

01:01:48.482 --> 01:01:49.522
I'm fine.

01:01:49.522 --> 01:01:50.882
Sharp? Is it moving anywhere?

01:01:50.882 --> 01:01:51.882
I need to get to the fifth floor.

01:01:51.882 --> 01:01:52.042
His wife's upstairs having a baby.

01:01:53.305 --> 01:01:59.595
