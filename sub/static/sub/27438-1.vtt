02:55.300 --> 02:56.301
Where do you think you are?

02:58.512 --> 02:59.513
I don't know.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.977
You. Where do you think you are?

03:09.690 --> 03:10.816
Where do you think you are?

03:12.818 --> 03:15.612
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you,
that's where I think I am.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.466
Hey, freak! Freak!

04:19.218 --> 04:22.429
No. No. No, no, no, no.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.308
Fuck, no.

04:48.497 --> 04:49.498
You think that's it?

04:51.083 --> 04:52.125
No, I wouldn't.

04:53.669 --> 04:54.670
Wouldn't what?

04:55.879 --> 04:57.214
I wouldn't think that that's it.

05:00.717 --> 05:04.680
Poured concrete. Foundation.
My guess is we're in a basement.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.271
Do you have any idea
how long you were in the van?

05:14.439 --> 05:16.149
Nineteen, 20 minutes. So...

05:17.317 --> 05:18.652
Fourteen, 15 miles?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.280
Do you drive for a living?

05:22.781 --> 05:23.782
I might.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.537
Well, how do I know
you're not part of this?

05:28.620 --> 05:31.707
You know like how they put cops in
with the prisoners in the movies?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.667
Fuck! That's what this is!

05:33.750 --> 05:34.751
-What?
-The movie.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.337
The two guys tied up
in the room and the hacksaw.

05:37.421 --> 05:38.422
That's what this is.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.967
-Tied up how?
-You never seen it?

05:42.301 --> 05:43.302
No.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.596
Well, you're lucky
'cause it's a stupid fucking movie.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.680
Chained.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.891
Right, they were chained up,
and then the one guy figured it out

05:48.974 --> 05:50.225
and that's when it got so sick.

05:50.309 --> 05:52.811
-I told Grace it was a stupid movie...
-Who is Grace?

05:52.895 --> 05:55.480
My ex-wife. Wife.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.816
I told her nobody would do that.

05:58.609 --> 05:59.610
Do what?

06:01.195 --> 06:03.071
Cut off their own foot with a hacksaw.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.702
Are you certain
about the 14 miles?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.163
'Cause this could be some
crazy fucked up shit just like that.

06:11.246 --> 06:15.375
Were you counting time or do you
just have a natural sense of distance?

06:16.627 --> 06:18.420
You just know. Why?

06:18.504 --> 06:20.214
I know that he picked me up first.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.381
Of that, I'm certain.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.761
And then we drove
about half your distance,

06:25.844 --> 06:27.471
which is seven miles.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.015
Then we waited for
a considerable period of time.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.227
Finally, he loaded
what had to be you into the van,

06:33.310 --> 06:35.896
and we drove to here.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.732
So that's 14 and seven is 21...

06:38.815 --> 06:42.027
You wanna do math when he could be
coming through with a fucking hacksaw?

06:58.085 --> 07:00.337
Hey. Hey, buds.

07:00.921 --> 07:01.922
Hey, buddy.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.760
I didn't mean what I said before.
About killing you.

07:06.844 --> 07:10.138
That was nuts. That wasn't me.
So we're square, right?

07:10.222 --> 07:11.765
You have to accept a guy's apology,

07:11.849 --> 07:13.350
because if a guy apologises
that's good, right?

07:13.433 --> 07:14.726
'Cause I didn't mean nothin', right?

07:17.062 --> 07:19.523
What the fuck? What the fuck you doing?

07:19.606 --> 07:23.235
Please, no. No. Come on.
What the fuck you gonna do?

07:26.488 --> 07:27.573
What the fuck?

07:30.075 --> 07:31.869
What the... Buddy...

07:35.581 --> 07:38.000
What are you doing?
What the fuck you doing, man?

07:41.420 --> 07:43.213
The fuck... Okay.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.592
Okay. Okay.

07:59.938 --> 08:00.939
You seeing this?

08:19.708 --> 08:21.627
Tell us your intentions, please.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.679
Hey, how come you do that for him,
and how come I got the choker on?

09:13.762 --> 09:15.681
How come he doesn't?
What does that mean?

09:15.764 --> 09:17.724
And how come
he wasn't gagged or nothin'?

09:17.808 --> 09:19.768
You crazy fuck! What are you doing?

09:30.988 --> 09:32.948
Are you putting on a show of some kind?

09:33.031 --> 09:34.032
With us?

09:35.617 --> 09:38.996
You need to tell us what you're doing or
I swear to God I will fucking kill you.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.080
You hear me?

09:40.914 --> 09:41.957
We're gonna go live.

09:44.334 --> 09:48.505
In six, five, four,

09:48.589 --> 09:51.383
three two, one...

10:56.990 --> 10:59.284
Are they all on at once?
Or do they take turns?

10:59.368 --> 11:00.369
Turns.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.162
They're motion and voice-activated.

11:02.246 --> 11:04.206
But you'll never know
which one is on in any given minute.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.500
So just direct yourself
to the pilot cam.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.669
That way you won't confuse
everybody watching.

11:08.752 --> 11:09.795
Understood?

11:09.878 --> 11:11.588
"Everyone"? Who is everyone?

11:11.672 --> 11:13.799
<i>-Tell them about yourself.
-Who, exactly?</i>

11:13.882 --> 11:16.218
<i>They'll need to know
as much about you as possible.</i>

11:16.301 --> 11:17.594
<i>It can only help you in the end.</i>

11:17.678 --> 11:18.929
It'll make you seem more real.

11:19.555 --> 11:21.765
I'm not saying
fuckin' nothin' to fuckin' nobody.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.308
Except get me the fuck outta here.

11:23.392 --> 11:24.601
You wanna know how real I am?

11:24.685 --> 11:26.645
Go fuck yourself! That's how real I am.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.883
You think that was wrong to say that?

11:57.551 --> 11:58.677
What do you think he's doing?

11:59.678 --> 12:01.722
I think we will soon find out.

12:37.216 --> 12:38.217
No, no, no.

12:42.596 --> 12:46.975
No. What are you doing?

12:56.151 --> 12:57.569
<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

12:58.153 --> 13:01.573
Who you are, what you do.
To make you real.

13:04.618 --> 13:08.664
I'm retired. I was a professional.

13:08.747 --> 13:09.998
To them. Not me.

13:15.295 --> 13:21.260
<i>I am retired.
I was... I've had a profession.</i>

13:22.010 --> 13:23.387
The legal profession.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.599
I live on the outskirts of the city.

13:30.018 --> 13:34.064
<i>I was in my driveway when I was taken...</i>

13:34.147 --> 13:35.649
<i>I have been taken.</i>

13:37.776 --> 13:39.987
I don't know what I can or cannot say

13:40.070 --> 13:42.322
if I do not know
the purpose of my being here.

13:42.406 --> 13:44.032
You can discourse on whatever you want.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.621
I was physically taken.

13:49.705 --> 13:52.457
<i>Unloading groceries
from the back of my car.</i>

13:52.541 --> 13:56.170
My wife and I have lived
in that house for over 30 years,

13:56.253 --> 14:00.424
so she or one of the neighbours
will see the groceries in the driveway.

14:00.507 --> 14:04.261
I don't know whether
you left a ransom note or not.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.221
But, obviously,
someone will call the police...

14:06.305 --> 14:09.057
Stop it. This only works
if you tell the whole truth.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.809
What am I saying that is not true?

14:10.893 --> 14:11.935
You.

14:12.019 --> 14:15.564
Fuck you. No, no, no. Please, no.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.357
I didn't mean that. That wasn't me.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.860
That wasn't me.

14:22.738 --> 14:27.910
I do home repairs.
Specialise in roofing.

14:27.993 --> 14:30.037
To the camera. Tell them your name.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.707
My name is Ron.

14:35.000 --> 14:41.340
I have two children who are
expecting me home tonight for dinner.

14:41.423 --> 14:42.633
And all I was doing was going through

14:42.716 --> 14:44.676
the fucking drive-through,
for Christ's sake.

14:45.844 --> 14:46.845
That's a lie.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.807
What, you mean the parking-lot thing?

14:51.642 --> 14:54.061
Okay, I was going to the drive-through

14:54.144 --> 14:56.772
and then I pulled over
at the edge of the parking lot

14:56.855 --> 14:58.482
to check my tyres like I do.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.400
And then I get out and then
I get cracked on the head,

15:00.484 --> 15:02.945
and then I'm in a sack
and we were pulling away,

15:03.028 --> 15:04.530
and what the fuck is this about?

15:23.882 --> 15:24.883
Hold it up.

15:26.385 --> 15:27.427
Hold it up.

15:27.511 --> 15:29.763
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

15:29.847 --> 15:32.015
No, I know what this is.
This is Turkish prisoner shit.

15:32.099 --> 15:35.352
And like I said, I have two little kids
so, please, no Turkish prisoner shit.

15:36.645 --> 15:39.606
You. Read me what's on the front page.

15:41.650 --> 15:45.320
There was an oil spill
off the coast of Florida.

15:45.404 --> 15:46.655
-You.
-What?

15:47.531 --> 15:48.532
The paper.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.785
I don't got that,
the oil-leak thing. I can't find that.

15:51.869 --> 15:54.454
-You.
-Moncler,

15:54.538 --> 15:58.792
the Wall Street firm, has been
accused of false reporting to the SEC.

15:58.876 --> 16:01.128
I don't got that.
Is it bad that I don't got that?

16:01.211 --> 16:02.212
What do you have?

16:02.754 --> 16:05.299
The girl from the talent show
is getting married.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.383
You.

16:08.260 --> 16:13.265
The murderer of the Jeeter girl
was executed this morning...

16:13.348 --> 16:14.725
Yeah, I got that! I got that!

16:14.808 --> 16:16.435
He kidnapped and killed the girl.
I got that.

16:17.311 --> 16:18.312
You.

16:20.814 --> 16:26.153
Ten thousand vehicles were recalled

16:26.236 --> 16:27.946
for faulty brake lines.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.656
I don't got that. Fuck.

16:29.740 --> 16:30.741
All right.

16:31.450 --> 16:34.203
-"All right" what?
-Do we all get it now?

16:34.286 --> 16:35.537
I don't get it. I don't get nothin'.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.458
You have to figure out
why each of you is here

16:39.541 --> 16:41.126
and what the connection between you is.

16:44.880 --> 16:45.881
You have five minutes.

16:45.964 --> 16:46.965
You can't be serious.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.222
To prove I'm serious...

17:07.694 --> 17:10.280
What the fuck you doing with those?
Keep those fucking things away from me.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.076
I'll shove those fucking things
right down your throat.

17:19.248 --> 17:20.249
No. No.

17:22.626 --> 17:23.669
You're gonna need that.

17:26.755 --> 17:31.093
What are you doing? No, please!
Mother of God! Please, no!

17:53.156 --> 17:54.157
Five minutes.

18:23.729 --> 18:25.314
The towel is for the blood.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.067
It's not working. It's not going back.

18:31.737 --> 18:33.780
The towel is for the blood.

18:33.864 --> 18:34.948
The towel is for the blood.

18:42.497 --> 18:46.460
This way it'll bind
if I just hold it like this

18:46.543 --> 18:51.048
-and give it enough time. It'll...
-Ron. Stop. Stop. Listen to me.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.132
What?

18:53.217 --> 18:55.177
We have to try to be very calm.

18:56.261 --> 18:59.556
I have never seen anything work out well
that was done in haste.

19:00.766 --> 19:02.935
What just happened was monstrous.

19:04.228 --> 19:08.482
But it has told us a great deal about
the situation we find ourselves in.

19:09.650 --> 19:13.445
What he did was
not an impulsive act on his part.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.782
The garden shears. The towel.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.618
They were planned.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.955
He intended to do that from the start.

19:24.456 --> 19:27.251
And he intended to do it to you.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.544
Not to me.

19:31.713 --> 19:36.635
I counted 10 cameras.
He said they were live.

19:36.718 --> 19:40.556
That they're transmitting
images of us right now.

19:40.639 --> 19:44.685
When he instructed us
to look at the pilot camera,

19:44.768 --> 19:47.312
it seemed to me
as if he were anticipating

19:47.396 --> 19:49.690
that a great number of people
would be watching us.

19:50.941 --> 19:54.236
They might very well be
watching us right now.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.961
-The clock.
-I'm aware of the clock.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.714
He said five minutes
to figure out the connection.

20:13.797 --> 20:15.924
What the hell is he gonna do
when the five minutes are up?

20:19.136 --> 20:20.470
You don't get it.

20:20.554 --> 20:22.848
You don't get it because
you didn't see the fuckin' movie.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.101
I'll go first.

20:26.185 --> 20:30.105
I'll tell the exact truth to you

20:30.189 --> 20:32.399
and to everyone who is watching.

20:33.150 --> 20:36.570
<i>And I presume that includes our captor.</i>

20:37.446 --> 20:42.075
He was correct.
I did not tell the whole story earlier.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.870
My wife is not at home.

20:45.954 --> 20:49.082
She and my daughter
went away on holiday this morning.

20:50.042 --> 20:51.418
I drove them to the airport.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.630
And then I went to the grocery store.

20:54.713 --> 20:59.468
I was in my driveway unloading groceries
from the back of my car

20:59.551 --> 21:01.386
when a white van drove up.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.639
The driver,

21:03.722 --> 21:07.976
the man who is our captor, got out

21:08.060 --> 21:10.270
and started walking towards me.

21:10.354 --> 21:12.272
I thought he was lost

21:12.356 --> 21:15.984
so I put down the groceries
I had in my hand

21:16.068 --> 21:18.153
so that I could speak with him.

21:18.237 --> 21:24.409
And then he put a bag over my head
and knocked the glasses off my nose.

21:24.493 --> 21:26.078
I could see them on the pavement.

21:26.161 --> 21:31.041
There were oranges rolling around
and then down the driveway.

21:31.124 --> 21:35.420
I couldn't move.
He had me completely restrained.

21:35.504 --> 21:37.714
And then he manhandled me into the van.

21:39.716 --> 21:43.554
When we started downhill,
I started counting.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.601
Now you.

21:51.895 --> 21:53.897
Ron, this will not work...

21:53.981 --> 21:57.234
We have to get the fuck out of here.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.613
You were in a drive-through restaurant,

22:01.697 --> 22:04.074
or you were going to
a drive-through restaurant?

22:04.157 --> 22:06.827
I have two little girls
that I need to see right now.

22:07.953 --> 22:11.790
But you stopped and got out to, what,
to check your tyres?

22:11.874 --> 22:12.916
Right now.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.960
Is this part of your daily routine?

22:16.211 --> 22:18.922
Well, just 'cause I missed breakfast.
I wasn't even supposed to be there.

22:19.006 --> 22:20.007
What do you mean?

22:20.090 --> 22:22.259
I go to Zoop's Chicken
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

22:22.342 --> 22:25.679
Thursday... Thursday and Friday
I go to Steak 'n Shake.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.931
1:00 or 1:30 at the latest.
Everybody knows that.

22:28.015 --> 22:29.057
But this is Saturday.

22:29.141 --> 22:31.518
Yeah, I had to meet a guy
out on Old Sheltingham Road

22:31.602 --> 22:35.480
to talk about some damage
that the storm did to his place.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.525
Is the guy at the Old Sheltingham Road

22:38.609 --> 22:40.986
the only one who knows
that you were going there?

22:41.069 --> 22:42.237
He cut off my finger!

22:42.321 --> 22:43.488
Did you stop and get gas first?

22:43.572 --> 22:45.157
The finger that I was born with.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.534
The finger I had from my whole life.
That my mother gave me.

22:47.618 --> 22:49.703
Was the drive-through
one of those restaurants

22:49.786 --> 22:50.913
you can see from the highway?

22:50.996 --> 22:52.497
And we're talking about
fucking hamburgers?

22:52.581 --> 22:53.832
You need to focus...

23:16.146 --> 23:17.147
What did you figure out?

23:17.231 --> 23:19.024
We figured out that
you're a fuckin' homo.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.108
Ron.

23:20.192 --> 23:21.818
The answer is obvious.

23:21.902 --> 23:24.613
Other than the fact that
in the two newspapers you gave us

23:24.696 --> 23:26.698
we had one article in common,

23:27.658 --> 23:31.537
there is no connection whatsoever
between the two of us.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.956
Clearly, there's a purpose
behind my presence.

23:34.039 --> 23:36.333
Everything about
my abduction was planned.

23:36.917 --> 23:39.419
It required prior knowledge.

23:39.503 --> 23:43.966
On the other hand, Ron's abduction
appears to be completely at random.

23:44.049 --> 23:47.803
No one, not even Ron would've known
where he was going to be then.

23:47.886 --> 23:49.972
So I believe that
he was picked up simply

23:50.055 --> 23:51.932
because he was visible from the highway.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.809
Yeah, so what the fuck am I doing here?

23:53.892 --> 23:57.688
To prove the depths he's willing
to go to in dealing with me.

23:58.772 --> 24:00.566
We've got a problem in our society.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.611
Nothing that we say
has any value any more.

24:05.654 --> 24:06.780
No credibility.

24:07.656 --> 24:09.783
I say I'm gonna pay my bills,
it doesn't matter.

24:09.867 --> 24:11.910
The lender needs a credit check
to prove that I have.

24:11.994 --> 24:12.995
To prove that I will...

24:13.078 --> 24:15.372
I'll give you $22,500 to let me go.

24:18.333 --> 24:21.253
Nobody believes anything we say any more
without proof of intention.

24:21.336 --> 24:23.714
So if I say that I'm gonna kill a man,

24:23.797 --> 24:25.883
I need to prove that
I have killed a man.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.846
Proof of intention.

24:32.306 --> 24:35.142
-You need to stop now.
-No, I really can't do that.

24:35.225 --> 24:37.477
I will take you at your word.
That should be good enough.

24:38.103 --> 24:43.358
With that assurance, any other proof
of your sincerity is not necessary.

24:44.526 --> 24:49.281
That's true. Except, it's not you
I have to convince. It's them.

25:23.941 --> 25:27.027
I heard they gave you the shift today.
I thought it was a joke.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.321
On me.

25:29.404 --> 25:32.950
Or probably because everyone is
still too drunk from the party.

25:33.033 --> 25:36.954
How much damage could a retiring
desk jockey do on a Saturday, anyway?

25:38.288 --> 25:40.332
Lt. Roy! You got an incoming!

25:41.875 --> 25:43.293
They're not wasting any time.

25:43.377 --> 25:45.921
Well, the plan is
the whole building be empty by Friday.

25:46.004 --> 25:48.131
The new HQ is already fully operational.

25:48.215 --> 25:49.258
They asked for the duty officer?

25:49.341 --> 25:51.385
Nope. You. By name.

25:52.636 --> 25:55.931
Darnley? Didn't we come
to an agreement last year?

25:56.014 --> 25:58.308
<i>No more hacking city computer systems.
Parking ticket or not...</i>

25:58.392 --> 25:59.685
<i>Yeah. This is different.</i>

26:00.060 --> 26:01.144
What have you done now?

26:01.228 --> 26:03.605
I'm sending you a link. Go there. Now.

26:03.689 --> 26:05.566
-Darnley...
<i>-One of my chat groups sent me this.</i>

26:05.649 --> 26:07.734
<i>You ever hear of a place
called Zoop's Chicken?</i>

26:07.818 --> 26:09.278
<i>It's up Highway 9.</i>

26:09.361 --> 26:11.613
<i>That means whatever this is,
it might be local.</i>

26:15.784 --> 26:17.619
<i>-You got it? You seeing this?
</i>-What am I looking at?

26:17.703 --> 26:20.163
<i>This is live and
I'm pretty sure it's real.</i>

26:20.247 --> 26:22.916
You don't want to do this.
It is unnecessary.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.460
It's not a question of want.
It's a question of need.

26:25.544 --> 26:28.297
We need to give gravitas
to the procedure to come.

26:28.380 --> 26:29.464
<i>What procedure?</i>

26:45.147 --> 26:46.148
Shit!

26:46.899 --> 26:48.400
Hey, it's that creepy guy.

26:50.235 --> 26:52.070
Slosson's not gonna
give me the interview.

26:52.154 --> 26:53.322
He's going to CBS.

26:53.405 --> 26:55.782
A Congressman
from ass-grease West Virginia,

26:55.866 --> 26:56.867
and he's lied to me.

26:58.619 --> 27:00.662
The world is nothing
but creepy guys, Kaitlyn.

27:00.746 --> 27:02.289
-Which one?
-At 53 Division.

27:02.372 --> 27:03.790
His name is Eddie.

27:03.874 --> 27:05.209
And, yes, he's very creepy,

27:05.292 --> 27:07.753
but creepy's how we get things done.
He's devoted to me.

27:07.836 --> 27:09.254
Okay, well, he just said
if you don't want it,

27:09.338 --> 27:10.881
he's gonna give it to
Channel 6 in four minutes.

27:10.964 --> 27:12.007
Cocksucker!

27:14.885 --> 27:15.886
Thank you.

27:25.896 --> 27:27.773
<i>You know this is too much.</i>

27:27.856 --> 27:28.982
<i>How do you figure?</i>

27:29.066 --> 27:30.526
<i>If we're really
being honest with each other,</i>

27:30.609 --> 27:33.487
<i>and pretty soon we're gonna have to be
very honest with each other...</i>

27:33.570 --> 27:36.073
<i>We both know that
this is absolutely necessary.</i>

27:37.950 --> 27:40.494
<i>This will keep it real.
This will keep their attention.</i>

27:40.577 --> 27:43.622
You don't think cutting off his finger
was real enough?

27:43.705 --> 27:44.706
Live?

27:44.790 --> 27:46.917
Well, it looks live.
We can't really tell.

27:49.169 --> 27:52.589
You're not in charge. Not in this room.

27:53.799 --> 27:55.843
What do you mean "this room"?

28:19.157 --> 28:20.158
I'm sorry.

28:26.415 --> 28:27.416
I'm sorry.

28:35.048 --> 28:37.551
What is this about? Really?

28:41.638 --> 28:42.639
Justice.

28:51.565 --> 28:52.566
No!

28:55.485 --> 28:56.486
Holy shit.

28:57.821 --> 28:59.865
-Sweet Jesus.
-Oh, shit.

29:03.452 --> 29:04.828
<i>Do I have your attention now?</i>

29:14.838 --> 29:16.715
Okay, I want all free hands on this.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.383
I want to know everything
about that transmission

29:18.467 --> 29:20.552
and how long it's been going.

29:20.636 --> 29:21.637
-That was live.
-No. We can't verify that.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.805
-It looked live!
-Yes, everything looks live.

30:10.102 --> 30:13.438
We need anyone we can get
from tech support down here now.

30:13.522 --> 30:14.523
Yes, I'll hold.

30:15.858 --> 30:19.111
Sir, shouldn't we get
Lieutenant Lucas, sir? Someone...

30:19.194 --> 30:20.654
With more field experience?

30:22.281 --> 30:23.407
We certainly should...

30:24.366 --> 30:26.368
I don't think
we're gonna have enough time.

30:51.643 --> 30:55.981
Well. Now that that's done,
what should happen now?

30:57.649 --> 30:59.109
I don't understand.

30:59.193 --> 31:02.321
What should happen to me?
What does the State say should be done?

31:04.031 --> 31:06.116
I don't think I'm qualified to say

31:06.200 --> 31:07.868
what should be done
and what shouldn't be done.

31:07.951 --> 31:09.077
Of course, you're qualified.

31:10.037 --> 31:11.246
I beg your pardon?

31:12.164 --> 31:14.541
You already said that
you were in the legal profession.

31:14.625 --> 31:16.251
At the very least, someone
in the legal profession would know

31:16.335 --> 31:17.419
the laws of their own state.

31:18.754 --> 31:19.796
I see what you're saying.

31:21.632 --> 31:28.096
Well, then you should be arrested,
incarcerated, indicted, and tried.

31:29.556 --> 31:30.557
And?

31:31.141 --> 31:33.644
-If you were to be found guilty...
-"If"?

31:33.727 --> 31:35.270
If I was to be found guilty?
You were right here.

31:35.354 --> 31:36.355
You saw the whole thing.

31:36.438 --> 31:37.981
All these cameras were here
to secure witness.

31:38.065 --> 31:41.401
If the jury were to find you guilty

31:41.485 --> 31:43.737
and recommend the maximum sentence...

31:44.780 --> 31:49.201
Well, in this state, you would be
condemned to pay the ultimate price.

31:49.284 --> 31:50.285
And what would that be?

31:50.369 --> 31:52.704
You would pay with your life.
You would be put to death.

31:52.788 --> 31:53.830
Like the guy in the paper.

31:55.457 --> 31:59.211
Yes, if you were convicted of
a capital crime, but you may not be.

31:59.294 --> 32:01.046
No two cases are the same.

32:01.129 --> 32:03.090
But the punishment is the same
regardless of the case,

32:03.173 --> 32:04.591
because an innocent person was killed.

32:05.676 --> 32:07.886
Cut and dried.
Seems to me that's the idea.

32:07.970 --> 32:10.222
I don't quite understand
what you're getting at.

32:10.305 --> 32:13.475
I picked a man up, I brought him here,
I tied him up, and I killed him.

32:14.142 --> 32:17.187
As far as we know he was an innocent man
who never did anything to anybody.

32:17.271 --> 32:18.981
So, there's no two ways about it.

32:19.064 --> 32:20.357
We're talking about the death penalty.

32:22.150 --> 32:26.154
Right here. Both papers. Big story.

32:29.825 --> 32:31.285
The Jeeter case?

32:31.368 --> 32:35.330
The Jeeter case. Read it.
Out loud to everyone. The whole thing.

32:44.214 --> 32:45.966
"Paul William Gager,

32:47.176 --> 32:48.969
"the man who abducted and murdered

32:49.052 --> 32:52.097
"fourteen-year-old
Claudine Jeeter six years ago,

32:52.931 --> 32:55.851
"was put to death this morning at 12:01.

32:55.934 --> 32:58.604
"Death was administered
by lethal injection

32:58.687 --> 33:03.025
<i>"at the Six Rivers Correctional Facility
in Triborough.</i>

33:03.108 --> 33:06.278
<i>"It was the swiftest enforcement
of the death penalty</i>

33:06.862 --> 33:08.322
"in the state's history."

33:11.158 --> 33:13.827
Well, I suspect there's significantly
more to the story than that.

33:16.914 --> 33:21.210
"A last-minute appeal by
Gager's lawyers was unsuccessful.

33:21.293 --> 33:25.422
"Gager was convicted of
Jeeter's abduction and murder

33:25.506 --> 33:27.591
"after a two-year manhunt.

33:28.342 --> 33:33.222
"Jeeter went missing from her house
on February the 10th, six years ago."

33:36.767 --> 33:37.768
I'm not bored.

33:40.229 --> 33:42.397
"It was discovered later that

33:42.481 --> 33:45.901
"Claudine had been
held in a homemade facility

33:45.984 --> 33:49.279
"for keeping rabbits
on Gager's property,

33:49.363 --> 33:51.698
<i>"three miles from the Jeeter house.</i>

33:51.782 --> 33:55.619
<i>"The search for Claudine Jeeter
was exhaustive and emotional..."</i>

33:55.702 --> 33:56.703
I know him.

33:56.787 --> 33:58.914
<i>"...and gained a great
deal of public attention</i>

33:58.997 --> 34:01.083
<i>-"as local and state police..."
</i>-We all know him, don't we?

34:01.166 --> 34:02.918
<i>"...followed lead after lead</i>

34:03.001 --> 34:06.797
"until finally they were
able to apprehend Gager

34:06.880 --> 34:08.799
"and link him to the girl's death."

34:13.262 --> 34:16.473
That's all there is.
There isn't any more.

34:21.311 --> 34:25.148
Maybe not in the paper,
but in fact there's a lot more.

34:25.232 --> 34:27.317
But I wanna make sure
I've got this right.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.487
So, if the court was right
in that sentence,

34:30.571 --> 34:31.737
and the State was right in exacting

34:31.822 --> 34:33.657
the ultimate punishment,
then it follows,

34:33.739 --> 34:35.158
as I have clearly stated,

34:35.242 --> 34:38.453
that I should be executed for killing
our dear friend Ron resting outside.

34:38.536 --> 34:41.164
No, you cannot say that for sure.

34:41.248 --> 34:42.708
I picked a man up off the street,

34:42.791 --> 34:44.208
I abducted him,
I took him out of his life...

34:44.293 --> 34:45.585
But there are other issues.

34:45.668 --> 34:47.963
The mental state
of the accused, the IQ...

34:48.045 --> 34:49.797
I brought him here, I tied him up,

34:49.882 --> 34:52.509
and I tortured him,
and I killed him for my own reasons.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.219
What's not for sure about that?

34:54.303 --> 34:56.096
No, you need a trial
to determine that.

34:56.179 --> 34:57.181
Why?

34:57.264 --> 34:59.641
Because without a trial
there can be no justice.

35:00.517 --> 35:03.645
Well, that's an area you would know
quite a lot about, wouldn't you?

35:03.729 --> 35:04.813
Your Honour.

35:24.666 --> 35:28.212
Judge Oliver Straight.
The man who tried the Jeeter case.

35:28.879 --> 35:31.715
<i>A man is guilty
for taking the life of another man.</i>

35:31.798 --> 35:34.218
<i>If convicted, that guilty man
must be put to death.</i>

35:34.301 --> 35:36.094
<i>These are the rules
we've established, yes?</i>

35:36.178 --> 35:37.262
Don't say yes.

35:40.182 --> 35:41.558
In this state, yes.

35:45.270 --> 35:48.023
That "yes" means that we can be
a little bit more focused, doesn't it?

35:49.441 --> 35:50.984
I have Carl on the phone for you.

35:51.068 --> 35:53.320
Tell Carl we need to
control the cutting ourselves.

35:53.403 --> 35:55.697
Yeah, well, he's not so crazy
about going live at all.

35:56.448 --> 35:58.992
That's true to form.
Which is why we're number four.

36:00.452 --> 36:01.453
Carl.

36:01.537 --> 36:03.747
I put it to you, Judge,
that if that is the case,

36:04.581 --> 36:06.333
things don't look too good for you.

36:06.416 --> 36:08.544
Because surely as
I shot poor innocent Ron,

36:08.627 --> 36:10.796
you're also guilty of
taking an innocent man's life.

36:10.879 --> 36:12.256
What man would that be?

36:12.339 --> 36:13.340
You just read the article.

36:13.423 --> 36:15.759
The Jeeter case. Paul William Gager.

36:15.843 --> 36:18.136
I can prove that
you willingly and knowingly put him,

36:18.220 --> 36:19.513
an innocent man, to death.

36:19.596 --> 36:21.181
And I'm ready to
try that case right here,

36:21.265 --> 36:22.975
right now, in front of
this particular judge

36:23.058 --> 36:24.768
and in front of this particular jury.

36:24.852 --> 36:26.436
I don't understand.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.356
Yes, you do.
They're right here. They're everywhere.

36:29.439 --> 36:30.524
And I assure you, Judge,

36:30.607 --> 36:32.568
these wheels of justice
will turn very quickly.

36:34.820 --> 36:36.822
Now, Carl! Now!

36:36.905 --> 36:40.200
Because they will beat us, that's why!
And we are not supposed to be beaten!

36:44.162 --> 36:45.372
For those joining us late,

36:45.455 --> 36:47.916
<i>I'm going to conduct a trial
for the life of the Judge.</i>

36:48.000 --> 36:49.418
<i>And whatever you decide,
I will abide by,</i>

36:49.501 --> 36:50.586
<i>but let's be perfectly clear.</i>

36:50.669 --> 36:52.546
<i>We're going by the rules of the State.</i>

36:52.629 --> 36:53.630
The Judge's rules.

36:53.714 --> 36:56.049
That means on a verdict of guilty,
he will be put to death.

36:57.384 --> 36:58.385
Right here.

37:05.017 --> 37:06.018
Court is in session.

37:18.989 --> 37:20.407
Isolate and find!

37:20.490 --> 37:22.201
Let's get on to
what we know about Straight,

37:22.284 --> 37:23.493
not what we think we know.

37:27.039 --> 37:28.040
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

37:28.123 --> 37:31.793
<i>Harper Grant with a special USCN report.
Here's what we know...</i>

37:31.877 --> 37:32.878
God help us.

37:32.961 --> 37:35.380
<i>The judge who tried the Claudine Jeeter
abduction and murder trial</i>

37:35.464 --> 37:37.758
has himself apparently been abducted

37:37.841 --> 37:40.093
and is now being held
at an undisclosed location.

37:40.177 --> 37:44.097
<i>The abduction, however, is being
broadcast live across social media.</i>

37:44.181 --> 37:49.228
<i>To help fill in pieces of the puzzle,
here is USCN's own Jean Treblis. Jean?</i>

37:49.311 --> 37:50.479
Well, Harper, it's kind of early to say,

37:50.562 --> 37:51.563
but it looks like
that what's happening is...

37:51.647 --> 37:54.316
Some of the concerns
about how Justice Oliver Straight

37:54.399 --> 37:56.193
tried the Jeeter case
are coming home to roost?

37:56.568 --> 37:57.986
<i>You can look at it that way.</i>

37:58.070 --> 38:01.281
Did you ever hear anyone question
how Judge Straight handled the case?

38:02.574 --> 38:03.575
They will now.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.120
<i>At the least, we know
that a member of the public</i>

38:07.204 --> 38:08.997
<i>has decided to question the trial.</i>

38:09.081 --> 38:11.291
<i>And perhaps
even that verdict is in question.</i>

38:13.210 --> 38:16.380
Now, Darnley made references
to credit checks and overdue bills.

38:16.463 --> 38:18.090
There could be something there.

38:18.173 --> 38:19.925
Where are they pulling this stuff from?

38:21.969 --> 38:24.179
-Who's this?
-It's the IT team.

38:24.263 --> 38:26.598
-You're kidding.
-They're all in the new building.

38:26.682 --> 38:27.724
What can you tell me?

38:27.808 --> 38:30.185
You can't trace a stream
to a social media interface.

38:30.269 --> 38:33.647
Why not? Isn't he using
their server or whatever it is?

38:33.730 --> 38:36.859
Think of it as a telephone
that's been redirected 15 times.

38:36.942 --> 38:39.319
-So he's smart in that way?
-Pretty much.

38:39.403 --> 38:41.446
Can't they take him off?

38:41.530 --> 38:43.490
They could of course
shut the whole thing down,

38:43.574 --> 38:44.700
but then there's nothing to say

38:44.783 --> 38:46.535
he couldn't just show up
on any other platform.

38:46.618 --> 38:48.328
Yeah, it's a bad idea anyway.

38:49.121 --> 38:52.165
And we would lose our only means
of knowing what he's up to.

38:53.542 --> 38:56.420
Can we limit the reach
or whatever you call it?

38:56.503 --> 38:57.671
Possibly.

38:57.754 --> 38:59.631
-Will he know if we do that?
-Almost certainly.

38:59.715 --> 39:00.716
How can you be so sure?

39:00.799 --> 39:03.135
He broke into one of the
world's most controlled websites,

39:03.218 --> 39:06.430
bootlegged a live signal without a trace
and scrambled it a half-dozen times...

39:06.513 --> 39:09.141
My guess is he's smart enough to track
what's happening on his own site.

39:09.224 --> 39:10.517
Okay. Thank you.

39:12.060 --> 39:14.146
Okay, so the Judge
lives in Aspian County.

39:14.229 --> 39:15.814
Twenty miles outside city centre.

39:15.898 --> 39:17.399
We have two cruisers there now.

39:17.482 --> 39:18.942
They found an open Volvo wagon

39:19.026 --> 39:21.445
and a whole mess of groceries
spilled out onto the driveway.

39:21.528 --> 39:22.946
But we don't know when it happened.

39:23.030 --> 39:25.574
So we're running a check on all
surveillance cameras and any of the...

39:25.657 --> 39:27.743
-Check the cash register tape.
-What?

39:27.826 --> 39:29.369
In one of the bags on the driveway.

39:29.453 --> 39:31.705
It'll tell us the store
and the time of purchase.

39:32.414 --> 39:35.167
If no tape, check the bags
or the price stickers

39:35.250 --> 39:37.878
to figure out which store,
go to the nearest one,

39:37.961 --> 39:40.047
and get the time of purchase
from the manager.

39:40.130 --> 39:42.174
The receipt will give us
where the Judge is.

39:45.177 --> 39:49.348
If the Judge bought his groceries at
10:00 a.m., this thing went live at...

39:49.431 --> 39:50.933
-1:11.
-1:11,

39:51.016 --> 39:53.727
and a man can only drive
65 miles an hour

39:53.810 --> 39:55.395
without attracting attention,

39:55.479 --> 39:57.105
then the room they're in is no more than

39:57.189 --> 39:59.900
a hundred-mile radius
from the Judge's house.

40:00.526 --> 40:04.905
Now, if we allow for fixing up the room

40:04.988 --> 40:07.658
and picking up the other abductee,

40:07.741 --> 40:09.076
it's probably even closer.

40:10.369 --> 40:11.453
What have you got on the other one?

40:11.537 --> 40:13.956
We went back
to the start of the transmission

40:14.039 --> 40:16.041
and we figured out
it's a local. Ron Price.

40:16.124 --> 40:18.794
He owns and operates Priced to Pleez...
That's spelled with a "Z."

40:18.877 --> 40:21.296
Now, he has an ex-wife
who's still his dispatcher.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.882
She said his first job this morning
was out near Sheltingham.

40:25.050 --> 40:28.971
So, if our man picked up
Mr Price after the Judge,

40:30.013 --> 40:32.224
that means our location is very local.

40:33.600 --> 40:36.478
Well, it's patently clear that you have

40:36.562 --> 40:40.649
thought this through thoroughly,
and intelligently...

40:40.732 --> 40:41.733
Don't condescend to me.

40:45.028 --> 40:49.575
But you have made
some fundamental errors

40:50.492 --> 40:52.786
when it comes to judicial process.

40:54.663 --> 40:57.666
You say you're going to conduct a trial.

40:58.667 --> 41:01.795
You can't. A trial...

41:01.879 --> 41:04.131
"The examination of
evidence and applicable law

41:04.214 --> 41:05.549
"by a competent tribunal to determine

41:05.632 --> 41:08.635
"the specific issues
of charges and claims."

41:08.719 --> 41:10.345
All right. All right. All right.

41:10.846 --> 41:15.350
Let's look at "applicable law
in a competent tribunal..."

41:15.434 --> 41:16.894
But we don't have to.

41:16.977 --> 41:18.812
Because we already know
what law we're talking about.

41:19.813 --> 41:21.148
Premeditated murder.

41:21.231 --> 41:22.858
And as far as a competent tribunal goes,

41:22.941 --> 41:26.570
well, I'm just picking my jury from
the same pot you chose yours from.

41:26.653 --> 41:28.238
All that informs a trial are rules.

41:28.322 --> 41:30.240
We'll have those.
And we'll have temperance.

41:30.324 --> 41:31.533
That makes this a trial.

41:32.159 --> 41:33.785
But we'll have something
your courtroom doesn't have,

41:33.869 --> 41:35.621
or doesn't have very often.

41:35.704 --> 41:36.705
Which is?

41:37.623 --> 41:38.707
Justice.

41:40.292 --> 41:42.920
I will be the prosecutor
and you will be defending yourself.

41:43.003 --> 41:44.421
Out there will be the judge and jury.

41:44.505 --> 41:46.256
The judge speaks in a trial.

41:46.340 --> 41:49.301
This judge will speak.

41:54.640 --> 41:55.724
Holy shit.

42:01.563 --> 42:04.733
<i>From the moment Claudine Jeeter
was taken, she was front-page news.</i>

42:04.816 --> 42:06.860
A fourteen-year-old girl,
straight-A student,

42:06.944 --> 42:08.695
with a little pet terrier named Brownie,

42:08.779 --> 42:11.073
plucked out of her world
on her way home from school.

42:11.156 --> 42:12.366
Everyone was gripped.

42:12.449 --> 42:15.619
The public, the police,
the Judge-to-be. Everyone.

42:15.702 --> 42:19.331
We all saw the grandmother, Mrs Solsza,
on our TVs practically every night,

42:19.414 --> 42:22.793
as well as the cousin,
the family spokesman, Bertinad Solsza.

42:22.876 --> 42:26.129
They became fixtures in our living room,
part of our news, reality.

42:26.213 --> 42:28.131
As a result, the prosecution will argue

42:28.215 --> 42:30.300
that the verdict in the
Jeeter case was manufactured

42:30.384 --> 42:31.969
instead of arrived at in the courtroom.

42:32.052 --> 42:35.347
Not out of malice, but out of
genuinely honest outrage and desire.

42:35.430 --> 42:39.351
A desire to see someone pay
for the killing of young Claudine.

42:39.434 --> 42:40.811
But the prosecution will prove

42:40.894 --> 42:43.772
that as a result of this desire,
there was a race to the gallows.

42:43.856 --> 42:46.066
A race run on the
fuel of police incompetence

42:46.149 --> 42:47.651
and judicial corner-cutting,

42:47.734 --> 42:49.695
civil servants recreant to their duty.

42:50.612 --> 42:52.698
So an innocent man was put to death.

42:52.781 --> 42:54.658
<i>Whether the State thought
Paul William Gager</i>

42:54.741 --> 42:56.159
<i>was guilty or not is not the point.</i>

42:56.243 --> 42:58.328
<i>Does it matter
if I thought Ron the roofer</i>

42:58.412 --> 43:00.998
<i>was guilty of some crime
only later to discover that he wasn't?</i>

43:01.081 --> 43:02.291
<i>Of course not.</i>

43:02.374 --> 43:06.003
<i>All that matters is I killed him
and I had no right to kill him.</i>

43:06.086 --> 43:09.464
<i>The State killed Paul William Gager
and they had no right to kill him.</i>

43:09.882 --> 43:12.551
The prosecution will prove this
beyond the shadow of a doubt

43:12.634 --> 43:16.680
by pointing out that his arrest and
trial was systematic of a justice system

43:16.763 --> 43:19.558
that is ignorant, corrupt,
and bloodthirsty.

43:24.313 --> 43:25.856
This is not how it's done.

43:27.649 --> 43:29.860
-Are you speaking as the defence?
-No.

43:29.943 --> 43:32.196
Well, you can only speak
if you're speaking as the defence.

43:32.279 --> 43:34.531
I can only speak as myself.
I can't speak as the defence...

43:34.615 --> 43:35.616
Well, you don't have a voice,

43:35.699 --> 43:37.492
unless it's as the defence
addressing the court.

43:37.993 --> 43:41.830
...because, as I've already said,
this is not a court.

43:43.248 --> 43:45.417
Believe me when I say,

43:45.501 --> 43:48.462
you can make
a great study of a dictionary

43:48.545 --> 43:51.632
and brilliantly mimic
the way lawyers speak,

43:52.508 --> 43:54.968
but that does not mean
you understand the law.

43:56.136 --> 43:57.804
You're saying
I don't understand the law?

43:57.888 --> 44:01.099
I am saying
you do not understand the law.

44:01.183 --> 44:02.809
Exhibit A for the prosecution.

44:02.893 --> 44:05.354
The Judge's error.
Assumptions without reference.

44:05.437 --> 44:07.022
Judgements without support.

44:07.105 --> 44:10.859
The modus operandi of the man in the
black robe to make snap judgements.

44:10.943 --> 44:12.528
This is not my kind of law.

44:12.611 --> 44:13.779
Yes, this is your kind of law.

44:13.862 --> 44:15.948
And this is not my kind of courtroom.

44:16.031 --> 44:18.367
Yes, this is your kind of courtroom.

44:18.450 --> 44:20.911
The Jeeter case was a capital case.

44:20.994 --> 44:22.412
There is a judge, yes.

44:23.539 --> 44:26.375
But the verdict is
reached at by the jury,

44:26.458 --> 44:28.001
and they recommend the sentence.

44:28.669 --> 44:31.213
The role of the magistrate
is considerably limited.

44:32.464 --> 44:33.674
I expect you know that.

44:36.009 --> 44:40.097
But there is something else
going on here that concerns me.

44:42.474 --> 44:44.268
No doubt you'll let us all know.

44:45.853 --> 44:48.313
I don't believe you have
the right to try this case.

44:49.314 --> 44:51.483
<i>Not under any circumstances.</i>

44:52.734 --> 44:54.152
Is anybody here a lawyer?

44:55.904 --> 44:57.155
A criminal lawyer?

44:58.824 --> 44:59.825
I am.

45:00.742 --> 45:01.869
What's he saying?

45:03.078 --> 45:06.123
I believe there's
a clear issue of conflict of interest,

45:06.206 --> 45:07.916
and that being the case,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.752
we cannot even begin to proceed

45:10.836 --> 45:13.839
until I ascertain whether
I'm right or not, by questioning you.

45:13.922 --> 45:15.340
Except it doesn't work that way.

45:15.424 --> 45:16.592
I'm afraid it does.

45:16.675 --> 45:20.846
If I have any indication
of conflict of interest, I can object.

45:21.555 --> 45:22.764
And I object.

45:22.848 --> 45:24.099
I object to your objection!

45:31.773 --> 45:32.774
What happens now?

45:36.195 --> 45:37.613
So let's overrule it.

45:45.329 --> 45:46.705
Jesus Christ.

45:47.289 --> 45:48.832
<i>A surprising turn of events, Harper.</i>

45:48.916 --> 45:50.459
<i>But as the numbers tell you,</i>

45:50.542 --> 45:53.170
<i>right now, people are
clearly voting to support</i>

45:53.253 --> 45:56.048
<i>the Judge's objection, and overrule</i>

45:56.131 --> 45:58.258
<i>the man who is now holding him hostage.</i>

45:58.342 --> 46:01.595
What does it say? Well?

46:01.970 --> 46:04.681
<i>We have never
seen anything like this, obviously.</i>

46:04.765 --> 46:07.184
-My objection has been overruled.
-All right, then.

46:07.267 --> 46:08.810
<i>It appears that
the voice of the people...</i>

46:08.894 --> 46:13.941
By a vote of 47,239 to 19,640.

46:14.691 --> 46:17.861
Nearly 70,000 people
taking part already.

46:17.945 --> 46:19.446
<i>More than ten percent
of the people watching</i>

46:19.530 --> 46:22.115
<i>are actually taking part and voting.</i>

46:22.199 --> 46:23.825
<i>That seems a massive number to me.</i>

46:23.909 --> 46:26.828
<i>And I suspect that percentage
is only going to grow.</i>

46:26.912 --> 46:27.913
Holy shit.

46:29.540 --> 46:30.541
Stokely!

46:33.001 --> 46:34.044
Take a seat.

46:41.093 --> 46:42.511
What was his name?

46:42.594 --> 46:44.888
The detective
who oversaw the Jeeter case.

46:44.972 --> 46:46.431
-Steptoe.
-Do you know him?

46:46.515 --> 46:48.684
For a while, I was a junior in his unit.

46:48.767 --> 46:50.394
-Not on the Jeeter case...
-Call him.

46:51.645 --> 46:54.189
-Why?
-What if this guy actually has a point?

46:55.107 --> 46:56.191
About the Judge?

46:58.026 --> 47:00.821
I believe the obvious question now

47:00.904 --> 47:03.949
is are you going to abide
by the order from the bench?

47:05.242 --> 47:06.785
So you accept this as a courtroom now?

47:06.869 --> 47:08.787
I mean, if you're saying
words like "abide" and "bench"...

47:08.871 --> 47:10.622
No, this is not a courtroom.

47:11.373 --> 47:13.917
But if you abide by the ruling,

47:14.001 --> 47:17.045
that says something about
how you're going to address,

47:17.129 --> 47:19.047
how you're going to
treat your own rulings.

47:19.798 --> 47:21.633
And that might make it a courtroom.

47:22.259 --> 47:25.721
You said there were
70,000 people, right now?

47:27.055 --> 47:28.724
And more every second?

47:28.807 --> 47:30.684
Well, it would seem to me

47:30.767 --> 47:33.687
that whatever you're trying to prove
would be in jeopardy

47:34.563 --> 47:37.524
if you do not follow your own rules.

47:46.742 --> 47:48.660
-Go ahead.
-I beg your pardon?

47:48.744 --> 47:50.996
I objected. My objection was overruled.
So go ahead.

47:51.079 --> 47:53.874
You said "conflict of interest."
What conflict of interest?

47:54.833 --> 47:57.002
Well, you made a speech to that camera,

47:57.836 --> 48:00.047
and you did it eloquently, very well.

48:01.798 --> 48:04.927
The girl came from an ethnic community.

48:05.010 --> 48:08.847
<i>Some of their names
were extremely difficult to pronounce.</i>

48:09.890 --> 48:11.433
<i>But you said them with ease.</i>

48:12.893 --> 48:15.145
There's also the issue
of the dog's name.

48:15.229 --> 48:16.522
Every news piece mentioned the dog.

48:16.605 --> 48:18.774
-And the name?
-And the dog's name.

48:18.857 --> 48:21.443
But not the breed. I know that.

48:21.527 --> 48:23.362
Because that was one of the hold-backs

48:23.445 --> 48:26.365
<i>of the police
for suspect identification.</i>

48:26.448 --> 48:29.743
Certainly, it seems that
you know the Jeeter family well.

48:29.826 --> 48:33.330
You do, don't you? Who are you?

48:51.473 --> 48:52.474
I was her uncle.

49:05.904 --> 49:08.824
<i>This is a USCN breaking-news report.</i>

49:10.951 --> 49:13.078
<i>A special USCN update.</i>

49:13.287 --> 49:14.830
The man is her uncle.

49:14.913 --> 49:16.832
That is the story
according to the person

49:16.915 --> 49:20.377
<i>holding Judge Oliver Straight hostage
at an undisclosed location,</i>

49:20.544 --> 49:22.629
<i>in attempts to conduct
what appears to be</i>

49:22.713 --> 49:24.548
<i>a mock trial by social media.</i>

49:24.756 --> 49:29.803
<i>Here to help us sort through the details
is USCN analyst Josh Harkridge. Josh?</i>

49:30.012 --> 49:33.473
What we now know is the man
holding Judge Straight hostage

49:33.557 --> 49:36.310
appears to have
a very specific axe to grind.

49:36.393 --> 49:39.354
And that may explain why he's taken this
course of action in the first place.

49:39.438 --> 49:41.231
<i>Would this be some kind of a grudge?</i>

49:41.398 --> 49:43.609
<i>Well, that's exactly
the problem, Harper.</i>

49:43.692 --> 49:44.693
<i>We don't know.</i>

49:44.776 --> 49:49.448
What we do know is this morning saw
the execution of Paul William Gager.

49:49.531 --> 49:50.616
Claudine's killer.

49:50.699 --> 49:54.369
Now, if there is an axe to grind
about a trial being misconducted...

49:54.453 --> 49:56.705
It's possible that the family
had harboured doubts

49:56.788 --> 49:57.956
about the Gager verdict all along.

49:58.040 --> 49:59.416
I don't think we can say that.

49:59.499 --> 50:02.169
Now, Josh, tell me,
doesn't this bring us right back

50:02.252 --> 50:05.339
<i>to the question surrounding
Judge Straight's handling of the case?</i>

50:05.756 --> 50:06.757
It could.

50:06.840 --> 50:10.135
You do not have the right
to try this case.

50:10.219 --> 50:11.845
Any reasonable judge would tell you...

50:11.929 --> 50:14.473
No. No, we don't have to speculate
on what a reasonable judge would say,

50:14.556 --> 50:15.891
because we have a judge.

50:16.767 --> 50:18.101
And I don't think the judge will say

50:18.185 --> 50:20.646
that my relationship
to Claudine excludes me

50:20.729 --> 50:21.939
from trying this case,

50:22.022 --> 50:24.399
because the case at hand
is not about Claudine's abduction.

50:24.483 --> 50:28.111
It's about you
putting an innocent man to death.

50:28.195 --> 50:30.030
That's the case at trial here.

50:30.447 --> 50:33.033
So, I say we put it to a judge's ruling.

50:34.910 --> 50:36.328
That wouldn't stand up anywhere.

50:36.703 --> 50:37.913
It will here.

50:38.789 --> 50:40.624
It's not enough
to just surround the house.

50:40.707 --> 50:42.459
Someone has to talk to the family.

50:42.543 --> 50:43.877
That's why I said the cousin.

50:45.170 --> 50:46.713
Then let me talk to him.

50:46.964 --> 50:47.965
His name is what,

50:48.048 --> 50:49.424
Bertinad, right?

50:50.717 --> 50:52.970
-Then what is the problem...
-Lt. Roy?

50:53.220 --> 50:54.763
Hi. Leonard Steptoe.

50:55.722 --> 50:57.641
I was in charge
of the Jeeter investigation.

50:58.767 --> 51:01.228
Yeah, it looks like you've got yourself
in some situation.

51:01.395 --> 51:03.647
I'm in the middle
of a nightmare, Detective.

51:04.106 --> 51:06.108
I'm here to help you any way I can.

51:06.191 --> 51:08.944
All right, now to start,
there's information

51:09.027 --> 51:11.697
about the Jeeter family
that you need to know.

51:15.409 --> 51:17.578
Come on, you gotta be there.

51:22.082 --> 51:23.125
Shit.

51:24.918 --> 51:27.254
<i>The uncle? He's dead.</i>

51:28.589 --> 51:29.631
Say again?

51:29.715 --> 51:32.050
His car slipped
into the Tremont Viaduct,

51:32.134 --> 51:34.303
so whatever this freak says he wants,

51:34.386 --> 51:36.930
it's not because
he's Claudine Jeeter's uncle.

51:37.055 --> 51:40.434
<i>And it looks like,
once again, the objection is overruled.</i>

51:41.226 --> 51:42.853
Your objection has been overruled.

51:42.936 --> 51:44.813
<i>In this case, the argument...</i>

51:44.980 --> 51:47.316
I would like to know
the judge's reasoning.

51:47.774 --> 51:50.110
Do you always give a reason
when you're on the bench?

51:51.820 --> 51:53.906
You've already accepted
one of the judge's rulings,

51:53.989 --> 51:56.241
so that means you accept
the authority of this court.

51:58.076 --> 51:59.786
Let's be perfectly clear.

52:00.787 --> 52:03.582
The people who investigated
and tried the Jeeter case

52:03.665 --> 52:09.254
needed and wanted a crazed,
lone psychopath.

52:09.630 --> 52:11.798
And they needed one
for a very simple reason.

52:12.257 --> 52:15.677
See, the killing of a young person
is the worst crime that we can imagine.

52:15.761 --> 52:19.056
In order to reconcile
this horror in our minds,

52:19.932 --> 52:22.267
we need, we must have,

52:22.601 --> 52:24.019
and we must kill

52:24.561 --> 52:28.065
a crazed lone psychopath.

52:28.148 --> 52:31.818
Anybody who doesn't feel
that longing is inhuman.

52:32.861 --> 52:34.571
And it's written all over this case.

52:35.072 --> 52:36.532
The lawyers, the police.

52:36.615 --> 52:38.575
And most of all, the justice system.

52:38.659 --> 52:41.537
Every decision they made
was based on their humanity.

52:41.787 --> 52:44.957
And because of the way
that this shitty system is set up,

52:45.165 --> 52:49.086
they were allowed to take the results
of those flawed human conclusions

52:49.169 --> 52:52.714
and couple that with a power
that really doesn't belong to them.

52:52.798 --> 52:55.300
The power to give and take life.

52:58.428 --> 52:59.596
You have something to add?

53:00.556 --> 53:02.724
Is that really
what we're talking about here?

53:03.517 --> 53:05.853
The validity of the death penalty?

53:07.396 --> 53:08.939
I'm sorry,

53:09.022 --> 53:11.191
but for whatever reason,

53:11.525 --> 53:13.026
I thought this was going to be

53:13.110 --> 53:15.779
about something more original
and substantive.

53:15.863 --> 53:16.864
Look around you, Judge.

53:16.947 --> 53:21.618
Do I strike you as someone
who isn't original and substantive?

53:22.744 --> 53:24.246
This is about justice.

53:26.290 --> 53:29.501
Now, I want to question you
about the police work on this case.

53:29.585 --> 53:32.379
I'm afraid I cannot help you there.
I am not a policeman.

53:32.462 --> 53:35.299
Well, then I want to question you
about your interpretation of

53:35.424 --> 53:36.884
<i>the police work on the case.</i>

53:36.967 --> 53:38.886
<i>Would you say that it was thorough?</i>

53:38.969 --> 53:41.263
Up to the standards
that we expect from our police?

53:41.346 --> 53:42.347
Of course.

53:42.431 --> 53:44.975
It would not have come to
or withstood trial otherwise.

53:45.058 --> 53:46.226
What would those standards be?

53:46.435 --> 53:49.688
Isn't it true that most serious crimes
in this country go unsolved?

53:49.771 --> 53:50.981
By "unsolved," you mean...

53:51.064 --> 53:54.234
I mean no bullshit myths,
no dime novels,

53:54.318 --> 53:56.153
no phoney TV dramas.

53:57.070 --> 53:58.363
Isn't it true that what most

53:58.447 --> 54:00.490
real police officers investigate
in this country,

54:00.574 --> 54:01.992
they can't and don't solve?

54:02.075 --> 54:06.580
Isn't it true that only 18%
of all non-violent crimes

54:06.663 --> 54:09.499
<i>in this country are solved?
Eighteen percent.</i>

54:09.583 --> 54:10.584
Motherfucker.

54:10.667 --> 54:11.668
<i>And isn't it also true</i>

54:11.752 --> 54:13.170
that more than 50%

54:13.253 --> 54:15.547
of violent crimes go unsolved?
And nearly a third

54:15.631 --> 54:17.799
-of all murders go unsolved...
-That bears no relevance to...

54:17.883 --> 54:19.551
Hell, the most devastating murder
in the history of this country,

54:19.635 --> 54:21.553
the assassination
of a sitting American President

54:21.637 --> 54:24.056
in full view of the entire country,
is still unsolved.

54:24.139 --> 54:26.141
The Zodiac killer, the Lindbergh baby,

54:26.225 --> 54:28.393
JonBenÃ©t Ramsey, the Boston Strangler...

54:28.477 --> 54:30.437
The list goes on.

54:32.397 --> 54:34.066
Wouldn't it be stating fact to say that

54:34.149 --> 54:37.819
as a standard, the police are unable
to solve most crimes in this country?

54:39.488 --> 54:42.157
The Jeeter case was rock solid.

54:42.241 --> 54:45.077
There's not a person on this planet
that can prove otherwise.

54:50.541 --> 54:52.543
Can you tell me
what I'm pulling up here?

54:56.839 --> 54:59.258
You don't need me to tell you.
It's obvious.

54:59.883 --> 55:01.176
Answer the question.

55:01.635 --> 55:03.512
Well, they're newspaper clippings.

55:04.930 --> 55:07.099
Articles relating to the Jeeter case.

55:07.182 --> 55:08.642
You're familiar with them?

55:10.352 --> 55:11.687
Some of them, yes.

55:13.021 --> 55:14.356
From the time of the trial?

55:14.439 --> 55:16.149
I presume so, yes.

55:19.486 --> 55:20.904
Actually,

55:24.658 --> 55:26.285
those were all from before the trial.

55:26.368 --> 55:28.787
But you say that
they're familiar to you.

55:28.871 --> 55:30.455
Could you go ahead
and tell the jury what's in them?

55:30.539 --> 55:32.291
I'm not quite sure
I understand your question.

55:32.374 --> 55:33.959
That's okay. I'll answer.

55:35.002 --> 55:36.378
It's the story.

55:37.087 --> 55:40.090
The story of Paul William Gager
from the moment that he was arrested.

55:40.174 --> 55:43.427
The loner living out
in the country. Uncommunicative.

55:43.552 --> 55:45.971
He had that odd hobby
of metal detection.

55:46.054 --> 55:47.973
That thing about building
the rabbit hutches

55:48.056 --> 55:50.350
out of the roadside construction signs.

55:50.434 --> 55:51.935
The knocking out of the interior walls.

55:52.019 --> 55:53.103
But most of all,

55:53.896 --> 55:55.814
that photo, that high school photo.

55:55.898 --> 55:59.234
Is there a single person in this country
that didn't find that disturbing?

55:59.693 --> 56:01.653
-You saw it, right?
-Yes.

56:02.070 --> 56:03.280
Before the trial?

56:04.489 --> 56:05.532
Yes.

56:05.616 --> 56:07.826
Did you find it disturbing?
I found it disturbing.

56:09.286 --> 56:10.287
Yes.

56:10.454 --> 56:11.496
"Yes" what?

56:11.788 --> 56:13.665
Yes, I found it disturbing.

56:14.082 --> 56:15.250
Well, I put it to you, Judge,

56:15.334 --> 56:17.044
that you saw that photo

56:17.336 --> 56:19.463
and you put it together
with all those news stories,

56:19.546 --> 56:21.673
and all the evidence against him
just sort of...

56:22.174 --> 56:23.217
Clicked together.

56:23.675 --> 56:26.220
But, I mean, we can't forget about
the biggest piece of evidence, right?

56:26.303 --> 56:29.056
That she was found on his property,
we can't forget about that.

56:29.139 --> 56:31.808
And that little link to the shed
by the side of the house.

56:31.892 --> 56:33.310
Boy, that made sense.

56:34.144 --> 56:35.312
He was her killer.

56:35.562 --> 56:37.439
That was the determination of the jury.

56:37.564 --> 56:40.234
-Working from the facts.
-Yes.

56:40.317 --> 56:41.777
The facts that the police

56:41.860 --> 56:44.071
-provided to the prosecution.
-Yes.

56:44.154 --> 56:45.405
But not all the facts, right?

56:46.156 --> 56:47.157
What are you saying?

56:47.241 --> 56:48.784
Well, isn't it true
that the jury never heard

56:48.867 --> 56:50.911
about his previous criminal history,
because you,

56:50.994 --> 56:52.913
the judge, deemed it inadmissible?

56:52.996 --> 56:54.873
<i>Yes, it's true. I would not admit it.</i>

56:54.998 --> 56:56.708
-Why?
-For his protection.

56:56.792 --> 57:00.462
Because he had been previously charged
with attempted sexual abuse?

57:00.587 --> 57:02.214
It would have prejudiced the jury.

57:02.297 --> 57:04.883
But it was sexual abuse
of a man, Judge. Of a man.

57:07.678 --> 57:10.180
<i>A 36-year-old man
who he tried to pick up</i>

57:10.264 --> 57:11.723
<i>at the Sapp Brothers truck stop.</i>

57:16.854 --> 57:20.399
Isn't it true that he was also ordered
into a psychiatric evaluation?

57:20.482 --> 57:21.692
-Not by me.
-But the results

57:21.775 --> 57:22.985
of that psychiatric evaluation

57:23.068 --> 57:25.696
were also deemed inadmissible
by you, right?

57:26.363 --> 57:27.865
Well, help me out with something here.

57:28.282 --> 57:30.075
Would a homosexual man,

57:30.158 --> 57:31.702
<i>who's extremely claustrophobic,</i>

57:31.785 --> 57:34.913
<i>so claustrophobic, in fact, he knocked
out all the interior walls of his house,</i>

57:34.997 --> 57:37.207
choose to keep a 14-year-old girl

57:37.291 --> 57:41.044
in a seven-foot-by-five-foot shed
with no windows?

57:41.545 --> 57:44.173
<i>Because he must have spent
a lot of time out there with her, right?</i>

57:44.256 --> 57:46.884
I mean, making all those dolls
and the necklaces and the bracelets.

57:46.967 --> 57:48.969
So the size of the shed is the issue?

57:49.052 --> 57:52.723
-The size of the shed is not the issue.
-No, on the contrary.

57:52.806 --> 57:54.433
I think the size of the shed

57:54.516 --> 57:55.934
-is the issue.
-No!

57:56.059 --> 57:57.686
The size of the shed isn't the issue!

57:57.769 --> 58:01.481
The issue is the court
suppressing medical,

58:01.565 --> 58:03.317
psychiatric, and criminal evidence

58:03.400 --> 58:05.402
based on their own
goddamn personal bias.

58:05.485 --> 58:08.155
No, that's almost impossible
to substantiate.

58:08.238 --> 58:09.948
It may be impossible to prove,

58:10.032 --> 58:12.409
but it is possible
that it happened, right?

58:12.993 --> 58:14.578
Maybe, yes, yes.

58:14.786 --> 58:15.829
<i>It's possible.</i>

58:15.996 --> 58:19.166
If there's anything else
he can say or uncover,

58:19.541 --> 58:21.293
I'd like to know now.

58:28.592 --> 58:31.345
Let me be perfectly clear.

58:31.428 --> 58:35.933
I dedicated two years of my life
to Claudine Jeeter.

58:36.016 --> 58:38.268
I know I did right by her.

58:38.352 --> 58:41.188
So I don't have to take questions
from anyone.

58:41.271 --> 58:43.565
-Certainly not you.
-Why not me?

58:43.690 --> 58:46.568
Yeah, you made detective.
You traded it all away for a desk.

58:46.652 --> 58:47.861
You couldn't handle the bad guys.

58:47.945 --> 58:49.947
Now you're trading in your desk
for retirement.

58:50.239 --> 58:53.242
You don't have any right to question me
or anyone else

58:53.325 --> 58:55.953
about the legwork we did
on the Jeeter case.

58:56.203 --> 58:57.412
We got it right.

59:00.707 --> 59:01.750
Yes?

59:01.917 --> 59:03.836
<i>When did the police
or the news media release</i>

59:03.919 --> 59:05.712
<i>the information
about the size of the shed?</i>

59:06.171 --> 59:07.881
-Who is this?
<i>-It's Darnley.</i>

59:08.090 --> 59:10.592
And what's that stuff about
the necklaces and the bracelets?

59:10.884 --> 59:12.511
<i>It's not online, okay?</i>

59:12.594 --> 59:14.721
<i>And in my world, if it's not online,
it doesn't exist.</i>

59:15.180 --> 59:16.515
No one's said it before.

59:17.975 --> 59:20.561
Well, was there anything else
that was possibly suppressed

59:20.644 --> 59:22.980
in order to guarantee
a conviction in this case?

59:31.613 --> 59:34.867
Wouldn't you be better able
to answer that than I would?

59:38.412 --> 59:39.580
You're not her uncle.

59:42.666 --> 59:44.418
I know who you are.

59:45.961 --> 59:47.296
You'd better see this.

59:53.510 --> 59:57.139
<i>Well, if I am who you think I am,
you really can't say it, can you?</i>

59:57.598 --> 59:58.932
That's the bind.

59:59.099 --> 01:00:01.894
The Judge can't say
without incriminating himself.

01:00:06.356 --> 01:00:07.691
Question.

01:00:07.774 --> 01:00:10.194
If that guy withheld
certain information,

01:00:10.569 --> 01:00:12.029
who would know?

01:00:13.488 --> 01:00:14.740
Family.

01:00:15.532 --> 01:00:16.783
Who else?

01:00:21.496 --> 01:00:22.497
Us.

01:00:23.749 --> 01:00:27.044
<i>The victims. And...</i>

01:00:27.753 --> 01:00:29.254
The perpetrator.

01:00:31.006 --> 01:00:33.800
The person who actually kidnapped
and killed Claudine Jeeter.

01:00:40.098 --> 01:00:42.935
Were they able to absolutely
and without question

01:00:43.018 --> 01:00:45.103
tie the girl to Gager's backyard shed?

01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:47.231
You'd have to ask Steptoe.

01:00:47.689 --> 01:00:49.316
I'm asking you.

01:00:53.612 --> 01:00:56.073
I heard the links to the shed
were circumstantial.

01:00:56.281 --> 01:00:57.699
But they thought they were good

01:00:57.783 --> 01:01:00.869
because they had him dead
to rights on nearly everything else.

01:01:01.203 --> 01:01:02.454
"Nearly"?

01:01:23.225 --> 01:01:26.186
Well, the Judge can't talk about it
without incriminating himself,

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:29.648
<i>but here's how it might have happened
as these things go.</i>

01:01:35.696 --> 01:01:37.239
<i>He may have been close to her.</i>

01:01:38.282 --> 01:01:39.992
Close enough that he saw her.

01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:41.702
Not every day, but enough.

01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:43.412
Enough to know
how she went about her life.

01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:46.331
Walking to and from school
with her friends,

01:01:46.874 --> 01:01:49.126
and playing with her dog in the park,
and when she was forced

01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:51.503
to take her brother to the corner store
and she hated it,

01:01:51.587 --> 01:01:52.671
and you could tell.

01:01:53.297 --> 01:01:56.842
Her arms and legs in the summer.
The shade of her skin.

01:01:58.177 --> 01:01:59.344
She was a pure thing.

01:02:00.762 --> 01:02:04.349
Slowly, he realised he wanted
to possess that purity.

01:02:04.433 --> 01:02:07.311
Hold it.
Hold it in his hand like a snowflake.

01:02:08.187 --> 01:02:10.355
Protect it from being sullied.

01:02:12.566 --> 01:02:14.359
And then, eventually, he realised
that he would take her.

01:02:14.443 --> 01:02:17.321
He would take her
and he knew it was an awful thing.

01:02:17.404 --> 01:02:18.906
A horrible thing to do.

01:02:18.989 --> 01:02:20.073
He wrestled with it.

01:02:20.574 --> 01:02:21.783
Can you imagine?

01:02:22.117 --> 01:02:24.036
Wrestling with a thing like that?

01:02:26.872 --> 01:02:28.207
And then he just took her.

01:02:28.624 --> 01:02:30.250
In that one simple act.

01:02:30.334 --> 01:02:31.627
Seconds, really.

01:02:32.377 --> 01:02:34.755
His whole life up until then
just shattered,

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:37.674
like a mirror into a million pieces.

01:02:38.091 --> 01:02:42.971
But then he saw the reaction
of the news,

01:02:43.055 --> 01:02:47.768
and the press, and the police,
and he was so relieved

01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:50.562
<i>because he realised he would be caught.</i>

01:02:50.896 --> 01:02:52.731
They would catch him.
I mean, they had to.

01:02:52.814 --> 01:02:54.024
He always saw them on television.

01:02:54.107 --> 01:02:56.318
They were always saying
that they were getting the job done,

01:02:56.401 --> 01:02:57.486
working day and night.

01:02:57.569 --> 01:02:59.655
They wouldn't rest
until they found the killer.

01:03:00.072 --> 01:03:01.448
But day after day went by,

01:03:01.532 --> 01:03:03.742
and day after day he wasn't caught,
he wasn't captured.

01:03:03.825 --> 01:03:06.203
And he came to realise
that he was not going to be caught,

01:03:06.286 --> 01:03:07.913
and the reason for that was this...

01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:11.667
They didn't know what they were doing.

01:03:12.334 --> 01:03:14.920
<i>Sure, they looked like police,
but they weren't.</i>

01:03:15.003 --> 01:03:16.296
<i>Not really.</i>

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:18.924
<i>Day after day, they waved him
through their police checkpoints,</i>

01:03:19.007 --> 01:03:22.344
and day after day, he could breathe
less and less and less.

01:03:24.263 --> 01:03:26.348
Now, it might have been
that the abductor began to test things.

01:03:26.431 --> 01:03:28.767
The first time that they questioned him,
he gave them two clues.

01:03:28.851 --> 01:03:31.854
Now, they weren't easy,
but they weren't hard.

01:03:33.021 --> 01:03:34.189
Nothing came of it.

01:03:34.565 --> 01:03:36.859
So, the next time, he made it easier.
Obvious even.

01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:39.278
Didn't matter.
They didn't follow up on that either.

01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:41.822
So, finally, he mailed in
an anonymous confession.

01:03:41.905 --> 01:03:44.116
He even included some of his own DNA.

01:03:44.408 --> 01:03:46.285
But the police lost it.

01:03:46.535 --> 01:03:47.870
Now, if you can believe this,

01:03:47.953 --> 01:03:50.789
they were actually in the yard
where she was being kept.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:52.624
They were right there!

01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:54.334
All they had to do was
walk the three extra feet,

01:03:54.418 --> 01:03:56.837
<i>but, gosh, they just couldn't bring
themselves to do it.</i>

01:03:57.546 --> 01:03:59.047
<i>They would have found her if they had.</i>

01:03:59.423 --> 01:04:01.592
<i>And once he realised
how lousy it all was,</i>

01:04:01.675 --> 01:04:03.135
the conclusion was inevitable.

01:04:04.136 --> 01:04:05.387
He would have to kill her.

01:04:05.721 --> 01:04:06.763
He would have to kill the girl.

01:04:06.847 --> 01:04:08.682
That would be the only way
that they could catch him.

01:04:08.765 --> 01:04:11.018
Once they had the body,
once they had the evidence,

01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:12.561
then they would need to catch him.

01:04:12.644 --> 01:04:14.146
And once they caught him,
they would put him to death

01:04:14.229 --> 01:04:17.107
because that's the only thing
that should happen to somebody like him.

01:04:17.191 --> 01:04:18.317
Someone like him that would do a thing

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.028
like that to somebody
like her deserves to die.

01:04:27.201 --> 01:04:28.702
So he killed her, and once he began

01:04:28.785 --> 01:04:32.915
to reckon with the real moral realities
of the situation,

01:04:32.998 --> 01:04:34.374
he tipped off the police.

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:36.835
The police came
and they collected the body,

01:04:36.919 --> 01:04:37.920
and they collected the evidence,

01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:39.838
and after that,
they got everything wrong.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.217
They accused Paul William Gager.
Paul William Gager.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:44.968
Just because she was on his property.

01:04:45.052 --> 01:04:48.263
And because of the rabbit hutches
made out of construction signs.

01:04:48.347 --> 01:04:50.557
And of course, that goddamn photo.

01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:54.770
And that's what the cable news ran with.

01:04:54.853 --> 01:04:58.774
<i>That photo for four days straight.
Every headline.</i>

01:04:59.233 --> 01:05:00.776
And by the time
they were finished with him,

01:05:00.859 --> 01:05:02.402
the whole country knew that he did it.

01:05:02.486 --> 01:05:04.696
The trial, that was only a formality.

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:08.408
All that was left was for you
to preside over the execution.

01:05:11.078 --> 01:05:12.162
Yes.

01:05:13.205 --> 01:05:15.541
I am the prosecution's final

01:05:16.124 --> 01:05:20.045
and most irrefutable proof
that you killed an innocent man.

01:05:27.886 --> 01:05:29.429
I killed Claudine Jeeter.

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.683
There's not a single thing you can do
that can make that not so.

01:05:40.315 --> 01:05:43.193
Everybody is running down
that information right now.

01:05:52.578 --> 01:05:54.413
I understand

01:05:54.955 --> 01:05:58.625
how you have come to the conclusions
that you've come to.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:01.170
But...

01:06:01.837 --> 01:06:03.463
You have to remember

01:06:04.631 --> 01:06:08.135
that the law is administered by people.

01:06:09.386 --> 01:06:13.724
And people are not perfect.

01:06:14.892 --> 01:06:16.560
That's not the issue.

01:06:18.604 --> 01:06:20.898
We both know that that's not the issue.

01:06:22.107 --> 01:06:23.483
The issue is

01:06:25.027 --> 01:06:26.778
what is to be done with me?

01:06:32.826 --> 01:06:36.955
Well, if there were a trial...

01:06:37.039 --> 01:06:39.249
Well, I think we can get through
a trial pretty quickly.

01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:41.585
I'm saying that I did it.

01:06:42.002 --> 01:06:44.838
I mean, I've got all the proof
to back it up.

01:06:45.672 --> 01:06:48.800
I'd say I've got rock-solid guilt
coming and going.

01:06:51.845 --> 01:06:54.223
There's the question of intent.

01:06:54.306 --> 01:06:55.682
Let's talk about intent.

01:06:55.891 --> 01:06:57.267
Was it your intention

01:06:57.351 --> 01:07:00.270
when you first entered that courtroom
on the very first day

01:07:00.354 --> 01:07:03.065
to see Claudine Jeeter's killer
put to death

01:07:03.148 --> 01:07:04.900
if the jury found him guilty?

01:07:10.405 --> 01:07:12.699
I believed what they told me.

01:07:20.207 --> 01:07:22.960
There isn't a single person out there
who isn't going to vote to convict.

01:07:23.043 --> 01:07:26.171
And when that happens,
I will own the story one way or...

01:07:26.255 --> 01:07:27.464
Carl...

01:07:27.756 --> 01:07:29.758
Carl! Shit.

01:07:39.726 --> 01:07:41.019
I need to talk to you.

01:07:42.771 --> 01:07:43.814
Harper.

01:07:45.566 --> 01:07:48.610
Why did you float that crap
about people questioning the Judge?

01:07:49.403 --> 01:07:51.280
And all that shit about the verdict?

01:07:58.996 --> 01:08:00.497
Kaitlyn, listen to me.

01:08:00.956 --> 01:08:02.791
The story will be forgotten tomorrow.

01:08:04.626 --> 01:08:06.170
But not who told it.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.011
<i>You don't get the urgency of this?
We're watching it on television.</i>

01:08:14.094 --> 01:08:15.429
I mean, bring it up
to the Commissioner's office...

01:08:15.512 --> 01:08:16.595
What are you doing?

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:20.809
I'm getting authorisation
to take over this whole thing.

01:08:20.893 --> 01:08:22.769
All right?
Technically, it's not just a homicide,

01:08:22.853 --> 01:08:24.270
it's part of the Jeeter case.

01:08:26.564 --> 01:08:27.649
Come on.

01:08:27.733 --> 01:08:30.861
Look, we both know they are gonna
want me to take this over now.

01:08:32.029 --> 01:08:33.071
Yeah.

01:08:33.447 --> 01:08:34.573
I believe that.

01:08:36.867 --> 01:08:38.952
You know the new building
is finally ready?

01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:41.371
And I'm not gonna make it in there.

01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:43.874
Thirty-seven years on the force

01:08:44.374 --> 01:08:47.377
and it will all have been spent
in this rat hole.

01:08:49.046 --> 01:08:50.839
This precinct was famous.

01:08:51.465 --> 01:08:54.635
Did you know this building
is 120 years old?

01:08:54.968 --> 01:08:56.803
They redid it in 1960,

01:08:56.886 --> 01:08:59.765
but it was the original HQ
for all Metro.

01:09:02.267 --> 01:09:04.645
-Remember Frank Stoppard?
-Yeah.

01:09:04.728 --> 01:09:07.231
Every night he'd be on TV
talking to the press about,

01:09:07.314 --> 01:09:10.776
"We're investigating this,"
and "We're investigating that."

01:09:11.693 --> 01:09:14.696
Because, you know, the '70s were bad.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:17.491
-They sure were.
-Violent.

01:09:18.242 --> 01:09:20.452
But no matter how ugly it was,

01:09:21.245 --> 01:09:24.206
you just felt better looking at Frank.

01:09:24.997 --> 01:09:28.042
He looked right.

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:31.712
A touch of grey.
Always wore the right suit.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.756
All the other guys were slobs.

01:09:36.093 --> 01:09:38.220
Then I realised they looked like that

01:09:38.303 --> 01:09:42.015
because they spent their lives
knocking on doors.

01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:44.393
And working the phones,

01:09:45.102 --> 01:09:46.562
and chasing down leads.

01:09:47.312 --> 01:09:48.814
Frank was just the frontman.

01:09:49.106 --> 01:09:50.107
They all knew it.

01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:51.692
Including Frank.

01:09:53.068 --> 01:09:56.738
But today, everyone's a Frank.

01:09:59.783 --> 01:10:02.411
I didn't take a desk
because I couldn't stand heat.

01:10:03.745 --> 01:10:06.456
I took a desk
because I saw it all coming apart.

01:10:07.249 --> 01:10:08.542
And I wanted to do something

01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:10.878
that at least felt like
real police work.

01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:15.924
But this...

01:10:17.509 --> 01:10:18.677
Terrible as it is...

01:10:24.308 --> 01:10:26.226
Let's start with one simple question.

01:10:27.644 --> 01:10:30.063
Were there marks on her wrists and neck?

01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:32.482
-Yes.
-What did Stapleton say about that?

01:10:32.566 --> 01:10:34.610
Stapleton didn't do the postmortem.

01:10:35.194 --> 01:10:37.905
It's all in the reports.
We had Baker do the postmortem...

01:10:37.988 --> 01:10:41.533
-Stapleton's got 40 years with Homicide.
-Yes, I know that.

01:10:41.617 --> 01:10:42.784
An experienced pathologist

01:10:42.868 --> 01:10:44.119
would have made something
of the marks.

01:10:44.203 --> 01:10:45.913
We wanted to pick up Gager anyway.

01:10:45.996 --> 01:10:47.915
Our hero, here, just told us
the two of them

01:10:47.998 --> 01:10:50.125
made bracelets and necklaces together.

01:10:50.834 --> 01:10:55.047
If he knows that and it's a match,
then he's our guy, and he's close by.

01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:56.882
That's a very big reach, Lieutenant.

01:10:58.967 --> 01:11:00.260
He told us.

01:11:01.136 --> 01:11:04.348
Walking with her friends
back and forth from school.

01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:05.974
Trips to the corner store.

01:11:06.058 --> 01:11:07.518
In a park with a dog.

01:11:07.935 --> 01:11:10.103
He had to see her do all three.

01:11:10.187 --> 01:11:12.022
Well, are you saying
we didn't comb the neighbourhood?

01:11:12.105 --> 01:11:14.399
Because that's the first thing we did.

01:11:14.483 --> 01:11:15.692
No.

01:11:16.693 --> 01:11:17.986
I don't think you did.

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:19.780
I'm telling you right now.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.408
We combed that neighbourhood.

01:11:26.245 --> 01:11:27.454
No.

01:11:27.913 --> 01:11:29.831
So this is the original Jeeter stuff?

01:11:30.374 --> 01:11:32.584
I dug up everything we had
from the first day.

01:11:40.133 --> 01:11:42.636
<i>I heard the radio,
one of the police radios,</i>

01:11:42.719 --> 01:11:44.054
<i>and they were talking about the girl.</i>

01:11:45.931 --> 01:11:48.100
<i>So I hope nothing bad's happened.</i>

01:11:48.183 --> 01:11:49.434
What else do you have?

01:11:55.315 --> 01:11:57.818
Now, there's a string of older houses
along the north block,

01:11:57.901 --> 01:11:59.820
but only four of them could have
sight lines to the school,

01:11:59.903 --> 01:12:01.113
park, or corner store.

01:12:01.196 --> 01:12:02.906
But none of them see
Claudine's house, though.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.117
He didn't talk about seeing her house.

01:12:05.576 --> 01:12:08.871
He talked about seeing her at the park,
and at the corner store.

01:12:08.954 --> 01:12:10.622
Specifically, the corner store.

01:12:12.875 --> 01:12:15.085
There. Go back.

01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:16.170
<i>Don't get me wrong,</i>

01:12:16.253 --> 01:12:18.964
<i>there's not a person here that
doesn't feel terrible about Claudine.</i>

01:12:19.047 --> 01:12:20.799
<i>We're all praying for her.</i>

01:12:21.717 --> 01:12:24.178
<i>But, for sure, our civil liberties
are being stepped on here!</i>

01:12:25.262 --> 01:12:28.223
Go back.
The guy in the grey shirt in the back.

01:12:29.641 --> 01:12:32.477
<i>But, for sure, our civil liberties
are being stepped on here!</i>

01:12:33.562 --> 01:12:34.771
What's he saying?

01:12:38.859 --> 01:12:40.152
It could be anything.

01:12:42.654 --> 01:12:43.822
<i>Due civil process.</i>

01:12:44.489 --> 01:12:46.158
"Due civil process."

01:12:46.325 --> 01:12:48.452
Who else you heard lately
talks like that?

01:12:49.912 --> 01:12:51.288
Can you cap him?

01:12:56.835 --> 01:12:59.129
-Can we upload this?
-Why would we do that?

01:12:59.588 --> 01:13:01.924
To put ourselves where we belong, Tom.

01:13:04.134 --> 01:13:06.512
In a way, this case
has already been tried.

01:13:06.595 --> 01:13:09.306
The conclusion reached
and the punishment locked in stone.

01:13:09.598 --> 01:13:12.226
<i>My life for Claudine's,
my life for Ron's.</i>

01:13:12.518 --> 01:13:14.436
<i>I'm sure none of you
will object to that.</i>

01:13:14.853 --> 01:13:16.146
<i>But applying the same rules,</i>

01:13:16.230 --> 01:13:18.690
<i>who will answer for the life
of Paul William Gager?</i>

01:13:19.024 --> 01:13:21.860
Applying the same logic, someone has to,
because if they don't,

01:13:22.236 --> 01:13:23.862
you might as well set me free.

01:13:24.738 --> 01:13:26.323
That doesn't work.

01:13:29.868 --> 01:13:31.453
There really is only one person.

01:13:31.537 --> 01:13:33.205
One person who had access
to all the facts.

01:13:33.288 --> 01:13:35.624
One person who had
ultimate control over which facts

01:13:35.749 --> 01:13:36.750
<i>were given to the jury,</i>

01:13:36.834 --> 01:13:38.168
<i>and one person who had</i>

01:13:38.252 --> 01:13:39.753
<i>the authority to say "stop"</i>

01:13:39.837 --> 01:13:42.172
<i>in the event that justice
wasn't being served.</i>

01:13:42.256 --> 01:13:44.299
Most of all, the person who said,

01:13:44.383 --> 01:13:46.426
"Paul William Gager,
I sentence you to death."

01:13:46.927 --> 01:13:48.637
That person is right here.

01:13:50.764 --> 01:13:54.142
He denies that responsibility
because for the first time,

01:13:54.226 --> 01:13:57.980
he's being called out on an authority
that he's always so naturally assumed.

01:13:58.063 --> 01:14:00.482
Up till now he's only
ever supported the system.

01:14:00.858 --> 01:14:02.568
That's the system that elected him.

01:14:02.943 --> 01:14:05.821
The system that couldn't find
Claudine Jeeter while she was alive

01:14:06.238 --> 01:14:09.116
and the system that couldn't find
her killer when she was dead.

01:14:09.575 --> 01:14:12.911
And the system that sentenced
Paul William Gager,

01:14:12.995 --> 01:14:14.580
an innocent man, to death.

01:14:15.163 --> 01:14:16.832
With one key stroke,

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.418
you're going to pronounce him guilty.

01:14:19.501 --> 01:14:22.045
And together, we can finally get right

01:14:22.546 --> 01:14:24.882
what the system
has always gotten so wrong.

01:14:25.674 --> 01:14:27.509
Anything else would be unjust.

01:14:55.996 --> 01:14:59.625
<i>And as you can see from our monitors,
a huge number of people are voting</i>

01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:00.918
<i>to convict Judge Straight.</i>

01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:03.086
<i>It may not be due process,</i>

01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:05.506
<i>but it does seem to have
gripped viewer imaginations.</i>

01:15:09.259 --> 01:15:11.803
-Yeah?
<i>-Is there any way to stop the voting?</i>

01:15:11.970 --> 01:15:14.056
Clog it or slow it down or stop it?

01:15:14.139 --> 01:15:15.807
<i>We're getting closer,
but I need more time.</i>

01:15:15.891 --> 01:15:18.268
Maybe, but don't you have guys
to do that?

01:15:18.477 --> 01:15:19.478
Not really.

01:15:19.561 --> 01:15:21.480
But we both know you can do it.

01:15:21.563 --> 01:15:23.148
And right now, I need someone

01:15:23.232 --> 01:15:25.484
-who doesn't care about the rules.
<i>-Let me see what I can do.</i>

01:16:18.036 --> 01:16:20.289
<i>Some sort of stutter
in the voting process.</i>

01:16:20.372 --> 01:16:21.456
What'd you just do?

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:22.583
<i>I think I paused the voting.</i>

01:16:22.666 --> 01:16:24.585
<i>Bought you three, four minutes.
Not much more.</i>

01:16:24.668 --> 01:16:26.003
Okay, then if you could...

01:16:27.045 --> 01:16:28.130
What's that?

01:16:28.255 --> 01:16:29.756
A source at USCN texted it.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.967
It's a neighbour
they found in old footage.

01:16:32.759 --> 01:16:34.428
Our guy said he was interviewed.

01:16:34.511 --> 01:16:36.638
Hey, cross-reference this
against our records.

01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:37.890
Of course.

01:16:42.019 --> 01:16:45.522
Got it. Henry David Cole. 43 Glenmount.

01:16:45.772 --> 01:16:50.110
Six houses down and across the street
from the Jeeter house.

01:17:10.881 --> 01:17:12.925
I presume this is when you intend

01:17:13.008 --> 01:17:16.220
that I make the summation
for the defence?

01:17:17.971 --> 01:17:22.559
<i>I have already said
this is not a real courtroom.</i>

01:17:23.852 --> 01:17:25.312
<i>We've not had a trial.</i>

01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:28.565
No real evidence has been presented.

01:17:29.399 --> 01:17:31.401
No real allowance has been made

01:17:31.485 --> 01:17:35.405
for the reputation of hearsay
or conjecture.

01:17:42.287 --> 01:17:43.789
Let me...

01:17:46.166 --> 01:17:50.379
It's important that we all recognise,

01:17:51.296 --> 01:17:53.423
when a jury reaches a verdict

01:17:53.966 --> 01:17:56.385
and is delivering it to the court,

01:17:57.052 --> 01:17:58.637
it is doing so

01:17:59.012 --> 01:18:02.057
as the duly elected representatives

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:04.226
<i>of the society, of our state.</i>

01:18:04.393 --> 01:18:06.395
-He's losing everyone.
<i>-Of all of us.</i>

01:18:06.812 --> 01:18:09.773
I mean, that's fundamental,

01:18:09.857 --> 01:18:12.734
and it's very important

01:18:12.818 --> 01:18:15.487
that you understand that the...

01:18:19.032 --> 01:18:21.994
I should start again.
May I start again, please?

01:18:22.077 --> 01:18:23.662
I don't think you have time,
Your Honour.

01:18:23.745 --> 01:18:26.081
But it's crucial, for me...

01:18:26.164 --> 01:18:28.417
For me, it's crucial that...

01:18:29.084 --> 01:18:30.752
That they understand

01:18:31.336 --> 01:18:35.340
how a judgement is constituted.

01:18:35.632 --> 01:18:40.762
It's not my choice.
It's not my choice, it's the law.

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.806
Metro Police! Search warrant!

01:18:44.516 --> 01:18:45.642
Go, go, go!

01:18:47.477 --> 01:18:49.396
<i>Everybody in the house! Down!</i>

01:18:50.606 --> 01:18:51.607
Clear the room.

01:18:53.817 --> 01:18:56.570
-Go inside. Watch my back.
-I'll stand back.

01:18:59.489 --> 01:19:00.699
Clear in the kitchen.

01:19:03.118 --> 01:19:04.620
This is Metro Police!

01:19:04.703 --> 01:19:06.163
We have a search warrant!

01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:10.125
This floor is clear.

01:19:12.044 --> 01:19:14.505
-Sir, they need to get to the basement.
-He's not in the basement.

01:19:14.588 --> 01:19:15.672
He's in the basement.

01:19:15.756 --> 01:19:18.926
No. We're being played.

01:19:21.887 --> 01:19:23.472
Secure the door. Stand back.

01:19:32.147 --> 01:19:34.775
Sounds like a portable generator.

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.032
Somebody's been doing construction.

01:19:47.287 --> 01:19:48.497
What the hell is that?

01:19:50.332 --> 01:19:51.959
It's a ventilator or something.

01:19:57.339 --> 01:19:59.675
It looks like air is being
diverted off the property.

01:20:06.181 --> 01:20:07.474
I got something over here.

01:20:14.565 --> 01:20:15.691
Easy...

01:20:20.904 --> 01:20:22.072
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:24.616
Find out where it leads.

01:20:28.787 --> 01:20:30.706
It's not an emotional process...

01:20:30.789 --> 01:20:32.416
This is not an emotional process.

01:20:33.542 --> 01:20:35.294
It's a sequence of rules.

01:20:38.213 --> 01:20:40.507
We've got backyard access
to the ravine here.

01:20:40.883 --> 01:20:43.927
To the back. All the way to the back.

01:20:44.428 --> 01:20:50.309
The idea that one man could control
the entire criminal code...

01:20:53.604 --> 01:20:54.688
Spread out.

01:20:56.732 --> 01:21:02.654
That went out 500 years ago
with the divine right of kings.

01:21:03.071 --> 01:21:04.531
There's something back here.

01:21:10.287 --> 01:21:14.458
But there is no divine right
of judges.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.337
What the fuck is this?

01:21:24.676 --> 01:21:25.677
Easy.

01:21:26.053 --> 01:21:28.388
Easy. Cover me.

01:21:31.558 --> 01:21:32.851
Cover.

01:21:38.106 --> 01:21:39.733
Be very careful.

01:22:05.592 --> 01:22:06.677
My God.

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:50.304
She was 14, not six.

01:23:02.649 --> 01:23:06.069
<i>Moments ago, an emergency task force
team broke into this house,</i>

01:23:06.153 --> 01:23:08.363
<i>less than half a block
from the Jeeter home.</i>

01:23:08.572 --> 01:23:12.743
The police are working from information
that they received from USCN.

01:23:12.826 --> 01:23:14.703
<i>They may in fact be looking
for this man,</i>

01:23:14.828 --> 01:23:16.622
<i>Henry David Cole.</i>

01:23:16.705 --> 01:23:19.458
<i>Now with closing arguments
coming to a climax,</i>

01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:22.920
<i>the clock is literally running out
for Justice Oliver Straight.</i>

01:23:23.378 --> 01:23:25.672
So Cole has a record. Endangerment.

01:23:25.756 --> 01:23:27.424
But he got off on a technicality.

01:23:27.508 --> 01:23:30.177
But get this. He's some sort of IT guy.

01:23:59.248 --> 01:24:01.708
You cannot ask the law to be perfect.

01:24:02.543 --> 01:24:05.128
The most you can ask the law for

01:24:06.004 --> 01:24:07.339
is a result.

01:24:08.924 --> 01:24:10.342
Sometimes, any result.

01:24:11.051 --> 01:24:13.136
<i>Any result you can work with.</i>

01:24:14.638 --> 01:24:15.848
The Pilgrims.

01:24:16.765 --> 01:24:20.936
When they landed at Plymouth Rock,
you think that was their intent? No.

01:24:21.478 --> 01:24:23.063
It was a mistake.

01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:27.943
But nowadays we call it their plan.

01:24:29.194 --> 01:24:30.404
Why?

01:24:31.363 --> 01:24:33.323
Because it makes us feel better.

01:24:35.868 --> 01:24:37.452
You want fairy tales?

01:24:38.495 --> 01:24:40.622
Look in the history books.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:44.793
You want the truth?

01:24:46.461 --> 01:24:47.963
Here it is.

01:24:49.131 --> 01:24:53.343
It's about getting as close as you can.

01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:02.477
If Paul Gager wasn't the right man,
he was close enough.

01:25:03.729 --> 01:25:06.773
As such, a trial was held.

01:25:07.316 --> 01:25:09.026
A verdict was reached.

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:12.905
And there was satisfaction.

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:15.073
And if you don't like it,

01:25:16.074 --> 01:25:17.492
well, then you convict

01:25:17.826 --> 01:25:20.120
the woman who wrote
those newspaper articles.

01:25:20.204 --> 01:25:22.623
<i>You convict the neighbours
who talked too much.</i>

01:25:22.998 --> 01:25:26.376
<i>You convict the cop who can't read,
let alone read evidence.</i>

01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:28.712
<i>And you convict the detective</i>

01:25:28.879 --> 01:25:31.715
who was three feet away
from where she was

01:25:31.798 --> 01:25:33.425
when she was alive!

01:25:33.634 --> 01:25:36.553
And he didn't go that extra three feet

01:25:36.637 --> 01:25:38.972
because he was thinking of, what,

01:25:39.056 --> 01:25:41.225
of getting laid that night? Who knows?

01:25:42.059 --> 01:25:43.310
Convict them all.

01:25:46.104 --> 01:25:47.814
But you can't.

01:25:48.941 --> 01:25:51.443
So you get as close as you can.

01:25:52.027 --> 01:25:53.570
You have a ceremony.

01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:56.406
The torches are lit.

01:25:56.949 --> 01:25:59.701
You walk a man up the stone stairs,

01:26:01.161 --> 01:26:04.957
and you put him to death
on the stone altar.

01:26:07.084 --> 01:26:12.047
Maybe it doesn't matter
if he's the right man or the wrong man.

01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:14.883
He's close enough.

01:26:15.968 --> 01:26:20.055
Because someone had to be sacrificed
for the death of that girl.

01:26:21.849 --> 01:26:25.519
The justice is that she didn't die.

01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:29.982
Satisfaction is that
someone died for her.

01:26:32.025 --> 01:26:35.070
And if you don't like that?

01:26:36.363 --> 01:26:41.618
If it reminds you that
we are all still primitives? Too bad.

01:26:43.495 --> 01:26:45.706
The best you can get from the law

01:26:47.374 --> 01:26:48.917
is close enough.

01:26:50.002 --> 01:26:51.670
As long as we are

01:26:52.296 --> 01:26:53.714
who we are...

01:26:58.302 --> 01:26:59.511
We are him.

01:27:03.015 --> 01:27:04.057
We are you.

01:27:11.398 --> 01:27:12.566
I'm done.

01:27:27.247 --> 01:27:28.498
Wait a minute.

01:27:31.126 --> 01:27:34.046
We've been staring at that thing
since this began.

01:27:38.133 --> 01:27:40.844
I said this place was ancient the day
that I got here,

01:27:40.928 --> 01:27:43.222
but they'd already done a big renovation
in 1960.

01:27:43.388 --> 01:27:44.765
Okay, so what does that mean?

01:27:44.848 --> 01:27:47.935
That means they sealed off
a big part of the basement

01:27:48.810 --> 01:27:50.437
right here.

01:27:52.523 --> 01:27:57.319
What better place to hold a trial
for judgement than the police station?

01:27:58.237 --> 01:28:01.073
<i>We are going to come
to a conclusion very soon.</i>

01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:17.214
<i>And while USCN has been working
to create its own projections</i>

01:28:17.297 --> 01:28:19.466
<i>based on our own telephone
and online poll,</i>

01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:21.426
<i>we can tell you that whatever has caused</i>

01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:23.303
<i>the log jam on the original site,</i>

01:28:23.512 --> 01:28:25.222
<i>the abductor's site, seems to...</i>

01:28:25.305 --> 01:28:28.350
I lost the hold. A whole lot of people
are about to do a whole lot of voting.

01:28:28.433 --> 01:28:29.977
<i>...as quickly as we had before.</i>

01:28:30.185 --> 01:28:31.645
<i>Numbers that seem to suggest</i>

01:28:31.728 --> 01:28:33.689
<i>we're going to come
to a verdict very quickly,</i>

01:28:33.772 --> 01:28:36.441
<i>based on the algorithm
of the number of people watching,</i>

01:28:36.525 --> 01:28:39.570
<i>relative to the number of people
taking part.</i>

01:28:39.653 --> 01:28:41.321
<i>And right now it looks neck and neck</i>

01:28:41.405 --> 01:28:43.949
<i>for the Judge to be acquitted
or found guilty.</i>

01:28:48.453 --> 01:28:50.831
I suppose you're looking
for 50 plus one.

01:28:50.914 --> 01:28:54.126
Anything as quaint
as a hung jury would be...

01:28:56.420 --> 01:28:58.297
Would be boring, wouldn't it?

01:28:59.256 --> 01:29:00.966
<i>Josh, we don't know why,</i>

01:29:01.049 --> 01:29:03.427
<i>but it appears that the police
are suddenly racing away</i>

01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:06.180
<i>from the Cole home
for an undisclosed location.</i>

01:29:07.222 --> 01:29:08.307
<i>We don't know where they're going,</i>

01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:10.851
<i>but we're definitely going to track
where this takes us,</i>

01:29:10.934 --> 01:29:14.897
<i>and bring you the story live
and in full detail as events unfold.</i>

01:29:15.272 --> 01:29:16.815
<i>-We are following...
-I have to cut you off</i>

01:29:16.899 --> 01:29:20.527
<i>and let you and our viewers know
that based on numbers coming in,</i>

01:29:20.611 --> 01:29:24.907
<i>our USCN analysts are now making
a solid projection that...</i>

01:29:25.741 --> 01:29:27.409
<i>Well, there's no other way to put it,</i>

01:29:27.492 --> 01:29:30.037
<i>but this is terrible news
for the Judge.</i>

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.371
<i>Perhaps a major upset.</i>

01:29:31.455 --> 01:29:35.042
<i>All numbers suggest there is no way
the Judge will not be found guilty.</i>

01:29:35.125 --> 01:29:38.253
<i>Repeat. The Judge
will definitely be found guilty.</i>

01:29:38.337 --> 01:29:39.379
<i>As soon as we can,</i>

01:29:39.463 --> 01:29:41.840
<i>we will show you
how those numbers broke down.</i>

01:29:45.469 --> 01:29:46.637
We're both done.

01:29:49.014 --> 01:29:52.309
It says so on cable news.
So it must be true.

01:29:52.643 --> 01:29:53.936
Go, go, go.

01:29:54.978 --> 01:29:57.523
We're in. Move, move, move!

01:30:00.442 --> 01:30:01.735
Let's go, let's go.

01:30:02.027 --> 01:30:03.445
Move, move, move!

01:30:23.215 --> 01:30:24.716
You can't do this.

01:30:29.513 --> 01:30:30.681
Yes, I can.

01:30:54.246 --> 01:30:55.789
Stand up straight.

01:31:03.547 --> 01:31:06.633
The verdict is in.
The people have spoken.

01:31:10.888 --> 01:31:13.807
Oliver Straight,
you have been found guilty

01:31:13.891 --> 01:31:17.019
by a jury of your peers
for taking the life of an innocent man.

01:31:17.227 --> 01:31:18.729
<i>As such, it is the decision</i>

01:31:18.812 --> 01:31:21.732
of this court that your own life
should be taken for his.

01:31:26.737 --> 01:31:28.614
Are you a religious man, Your Honour?

01:31:29.865 --> 01:31:33.535
"And thine eye shall not pity."
Did you pity, Judge?

01:31:33.702 --> 01:31:35.495
-No.
-Louder!

01:31:36.288 --> 01:31:37.581
No, I did not.

01:31:47.674 --> 01:31:49.384
"And thine eye shall not pity."

01:31:49.593 --> 01:31:52.721
Repeat after me.
"But life shall go for life."

01:31:53.263 --> 01:31:54.848
Life shall go for life.

01:31:59.561 --> 01:32:00.604
"Eye for eye."

01:32:00.812 --> 01:32:02.147
Eye for eye.

01:32:03.941 --> 01:32:05.526
"Tooth for tooth."

01:32:05.859 --> 01:32:07.194
Tooth for tooth.

01:32:08.403 --> 01:32:09.738
"Hand for hand."

01:32:09.988 --> 01:32:11.365
Hand for hand.

01:32:14.701 --> 01:32:16.286
"Foot for foot."

01:32:17.037 --> 01:32:18.330
Foot for foot.

01:32:25.712 --> 01:32:27.798
Go! Everybody get down!

01:32:27.881 --> 01:32:28.882
Hold!

01:32:29.007 --> 01:32:30.050
Gun!

01:32:30.926 --> 01:32:32.052
Stop!

01:32:32.928 --> 01:32:35.138
I said hold up! Hold up!

01:32:35.222 --> 01:32:36.765
<i>-Hold fire!
-Holding fire.</i>

01:32:49.695 --> 01:32:51.488
Jesus Christ.

01:32:58.078 --> 01:33:00.414
Shit. No gun.

01:33:07.337 --> 01:33:08.505
Fuck.

01:33:18.473 --> 01:33:19.641
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

01:33:24.021 --> 01:33:25.689
Why'd you have the gun?

01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:29.568
He gave it to me.

01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:31.028
Someone get me a bus!

01:33:32.654 --> 01:33:36.533
He knew. He knew... He knew about you.

01:33:36.658 --> 01:33:37.826
Knew what?

01:33:38.285 --> 01:33:41.747
Knew that you were the executioners.

01:33:45.209 --> 01:33:46.376
Fuck.

01:33:47.794 --> 01:33:48.921
<i>Fuck.</i>

01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:57.429
Lieutenant...

01:33:58.055 --> 01:34:00.140
<i>We clearly apprehended
a lethal threat here.</i>

01:34:00.307 --> 01:34:02.684
<i>We had no choice,
but to protect ourselves.</i>

01:34:06.438 --> 01:34:07.731
Weapons check!

01:34:09.858 --> 01:34:10.943
We good?

01:34:11.109 --> 01:34:12.277
We're good.

01:34:17.491 --> 01:34:20.369
<i>There may not be words
for what we've just witnessed.</i>

01:34:20.994 --> 01:34:22.329
<i>There probably aren't.</i>

01:34:22.704 --> 01:34:25.082
<i>We go now to our reporter on the scene</i>

01:34:25.165 --> 01:34:27.835
<i>who has been a witness
to today's events, Harper Grant.</i>

01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:31.672
Josh, we were only bystanders
in all of this.

01:34:32.714 --> 01:34:36.468
But there was no question
that we have witnessed tragedy.

01:34:37.845 --> 01:34:39.638
<i>Here's what we've been able
to figure out...</i>
