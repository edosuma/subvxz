00:55.461 --> 00:56.621
Market reports today...

00:56.696 --> 01:01.191
barrows and gilts at 220 to 260 pounds
are lower at $40.

01:01.267 --> 01:04.863
Sows are steady.
300 to 500 pounds, $34 to $37.

01:04.937 --> 01:08.931
Goin' over to the feeder cattle,
beef steers, $120 to $150...

01:10.778 --> 01:11.767
The way I like to do it...

01:11.846 --> 01:14.905
is I take one can
of cream of mushroom soup...

01:14.982 --> 01:16.883
and then one package of egg noodles.

01:16.951 --> 01:20.011
I like the egg noodles
better than the Italian ones.

01:20.088 --> 01:21.214
I like to put...

01:24.727 --> 01:27.594
<i>If we look at what the Lord said
in the book of Revelation...</i>

01:27.663 --> 01:30.860
you can be sure
that there's a price to pay...

01:30.932 --> 01:35.529
for the way of the flesh
and that price will be paid if you don't...

01:35.604 --> 01:40.235
Here's the wind-up and the pitch.

01:40.310 --> 01:42.437
And it's two and two, two and two...

01:51.087 --> 01:53.022
Before you just say,
"Honey, I think we have to have...

01:53.089 --> 01:55.456
"some couple's counseling.
I mean, I think we have a problem.

01:55.526 --> 01:56.515
"I can't leave a cup here for... "

02:06.505 --> 02:09.031
All right. It's time for traffic on the fives...

02:09.107 --> 02:10.664
and let's find out
what's going on with your drive.

02:10.741 --> 02:12.540
Let's go to Chopper.
Chopper, what's happening?

02:12.611 --> 02:15.239
All right, Lettie.
We got a fifteen-minute, uh, wait-494.

02:15.313 --> 02:17.509
There's an accident working
at the spaghetti junction.

02:17.582 --> 02:19.915
at 630, but it still
will make a very slow go...

02:40.640 --> 02:44.702
A quiet night in a city that knows
how to keep its secrets.

02:44.778 --> 02:49.646
But one man is still looking for
the answers to life's persistent questions.

02:54.488 --> 02:56.149
That's me.

02:56.224 --> 02:58.283
Or it used to be.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.624
It was a rainy Saturday night in St. Paul...

03:00.762 --> 03:03.391
and I had just finished off
a grilled cheese sandwich...

03:03.466 --> 03:04.830
with beans for a chaser...

03:04.899 --> 03:07.561
and it was time to head
for work across the street.

03:18.881 --> 03:20.609
I'm a private eye.

03:20.682 --> 03:22.172
Noir's the name.

03:22.251 --> 03:23.776
Guy Noir.

03:23.854 --> 03:27.880
But I'd taken temporary employment
about six years before...

03:27.958 --> 03:33.157
<i>doing security for a radio show
called A Prairie Home Companion...</i>

03:33.230 --> 03:36.223
on account of a serious
cash-flow problem...

03:36.299 --> 03:40.863
due to a lack of missing heiresses
and dead tycoons lying in the solarium...

03:40.938 --> 03:44.635
with lipstick stains
on their smoking jackets.

03:44.709 --> 03:47.940
In other words, I was broke.

03:48.012 --> 03:51.915
This radio show was done
out of an old theater called the Fitzgerald...

03:51.984 --> 03:55.249
and it had been on the air
since Jesus was in the third grade.

03:55.321 --> 03:59.313
But it was still pulling in
a few hundred people on Saturday nights.

03:59.390 --> 04:04.351
It was a live radio variety show,
the kind that died fifty years ago...

04:04.429 --> 04:09.595
but somebody forgot to tell them
until this night.

04:09.668 --> 04:13.469
A big corporation down in Texas
had bought up the radio station...

04:13.540 --> 04:16.202
and their axeman,
a guy named Cruett...

04:16.274 --> 04:18.870
was on his way to St. Paul
to shut the thing down...

04:18.945 --> 04:21.435
and turn the theater
into a parking lot.

04:24.518 --> 04:28.681
It was curtains and everybody knew it,
but nobody said so.

04:28.755 --> 04:30.689
They were Midwesterners.

04:30.757 --> 04:35.058
They felt like if you ignored bad news,
it might go away.

04:35.128 --> 04:38.724
Not my philosophy,
but I'm not from here.

04:38.799 --> 04:40.392
Stay on the edge of the crowd.

04:40.470 --> 04:41.457
Keep your eyes open.

04:41.535 --> 04:43.662
That's my motto.

04:43.739 --> 04:46.935
It was my last night
of gainful employment...

04:47.008 --> 04:50.307
and I had a feeling
it was maybe going to be interesting.

04:54.784 --> 04:58.185

05:30.455 --> 05:32.012

I gotta show you some changes.

05:32.090 --> 05:33.079
Where's my pencil?

05:33.158 --> 05:34.216
I just put it down here a second ago.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.519
Where'd you put it last?

05:35.592 --> 05:36.720
I just had it here a second ago.

05:36.796 --> 05:37.989
Oh, it's-it's-

05:38.062 --> 05:39.154
Don't mess with those.

05:39.230 --> 05:41.164
Hey, hey, hey.
Please, move that back.

05:41.233 --> 05:42.996

05:43.068 --> 05:45.866

green-eyed with envy.

Ooh!

05:47.573 --> 05:48.539
One more.

05:48.607 --> 05:50.541
Do you think
she's coming by the studio?

05:50.609 --> 05:52.236
Cuddle up a little bit.
There you go.

05:53.913 --> 05:56.108
Hey, Guy.
How are you tonight?

05:56.182 --> 05:57.547
I need a little help from you.

05:57.617 --> 05:59.846
Take these Johnson Girl t-shirts.
Have someone take 'em up front.

05:59.919 --> 06:02.548
- I'll take care of it.
- Nice tie.

06:02.622 --> 06:03.987
Well, it's about damn time.

06:04.057 --> 06:05.456
The very tardy Johnson Girls.

06:05.525 --> 06:06.492
Hey, Al.

06:06.559 --> 06:07.686
Givin' me a heart attack here.

06:07.761 --> 06:10.355
What is this? Rewrites?

06:10.430 --> 06:12.296
What's wrong with the old script?

06:12.365 --> 06:13.333
How does that feel?

06:13.401 --> 06:15.095
Give me a little sound effects on that one.

06:15.168 --> 06:18.002
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now at six minutes to broadcast.

06:18.071 --> 06:19.699
Six minutes from broadcast, please.

06:19.773 --> 06:20.900
That's the-that's the-

06:20.976 --> 06:22.772
Hey, Rich, that's that Honolulu mama...

06:22.844 --> 06:24.812
how she could dance
in her pink pajamas...

06:24.879 --> 06:27.007
when she took off
her Oahu Oahu Oahu.

06:27.081 --> 06:29.482
No, it's an old
Carter family song, right?

06:29.550 --> 06:30.518
A what?

06:30.586 --> 06:32.850
Carter family, sweetheart.

06:32.922 --> 06:35.151
Just like us, only famous.

06:35.957 --> 06:37.289
Now, how long you been doin' this?

06:37.360 --> 06:39.828
Doin' what?
Puttin' my pants on?

06:39.896 --> 06:41.523
How long you been doin' radio?

06:41.598 --> 06:43.361
Oh.

06:43.433 --> 06:45.958
I don't know.
Thirty-some years, I guess.

06:46.034 --> 06:49.128
Started out in Mark Twain Days,
Mississippi River...

06:49.204 --> 06:51.570
and they hired me to play Huck Finn.

06:51.641 --> 06:55.441
I was running a raft
on the Mississippi...

06:55.512 --> 06:58.606
and carrying people across, and, uh...

06:58.681 --> 07:01.172
it ran into the wake of a steamboat.

07:01.251 --> 07:03.345
Mr. Keillor?
We need you on stage.

07:03.419 --> 07:04.387
Fine. I'm right there.

07:04.455 --> 07:07.288
Is this the story about the guy
who ends up hangin' from a kite...

07:07.358 --> 07:09.689
bein' pulled by a boat
with his shorts around his ankles?

07:09.760 --> 07:12.354
No. No, it's a different story
about a pontoon boat.

07:12.429 --> 07:14.920
Oh! Look at this old house.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.627
Good-bye, old house.

07:16.701 --> 07:17.895
Good-bye, old porch.

07:17.968 --> 07:19.560
Good-bye, old Guy.

07:19.637 --> 07:24.438
Hey, Guy. What are they gonna do
with this house, you think? Huh?

07:24.508 --> 07:26.772
I figure it had somethin' to do...

07:26.845 --> 07:30.043
with the dumpster
that showed up yesterday.

07:30.115 --> 07:31.548
Oh, my God.
Honey, listen.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.676
I brought you that cute little dress-

07:33.752 --> 07:35.881
I already told you,
I don't like the dress.

07:35.956 --> 07:36.921
At least try it on.

07:36.989 --> 07:38.013
I want to see it on you.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.250
You try it on.
I don't want to try it on.

07:39.325 --> 07:40.314
It's ugly.

07:40.394 --> 07:41.519
It's the color of vomit.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.730
Oh, sorry.

07:50.736 --> 07:54.196
Old man Soderberg was
one of those people who was on that raft...

07:54.275 --> 07:58.370
and, uh, he went over the rail
and into the river...

07:58.445 --> 08:01.278
and I went in for him
'cause he couldn't swim.

08:01.348 --> 08:04.374
So, I pulled him out.

08:04.451 --> 08:05.611
You saved his life?

08:05.686 --> 08:08.019
Well, not really.
The river was shallow at that point...

08:08.089 --> 08:10.557
but he didn't know that
'cause I had hold of his ankles.

08:10.626 --> 08:12.252
I was towing him into shore.

08:12.327 --> 08:13.487
Hey! It's good to see ya!

08:13.561 --> 08:15.553
Four minutes from broadcast, please.

08:15.630 --> 08:16.995
Four minutes.

08:17.066 --> 08:20.034
Ooh! Hey.

08:20.101 --> 08:21.193
Hey.

08:21.269 --> 08:22.737
Wait a minute.
Where's my bag?

08:22.805 --> 08:23.965
No, no. The bag's here.

08:24.039 --> 08:25.267
I brought it in.

08:25.341 --> 08:26.934
Mom, just look.

08:27.009 --> 08:28.601
Here it is.
Come on, Yolanda.

08:28.677 --> 08:32.205
<i>I swear to God I'm all,
you know, verklempt.</i>

08:32.282 --> 08:34.147
Ha ha ha ha!

08:34.217 --> 08:35.308
Ohh.

08:35.385 --> 08:36.477
Hot.

08:36.553 --> 08:39.611
Yeah. See? Plenty of time.

08:39.688 --> 08:41.621
So he gave you the job at WLT.

08:41.691 --> 08:42.782
Well, his brother did, actually.

08:42.859 --> 08:43.951
Yeah, Art Soderberg.

08:44.025 --> 08:45.120
G.K. to the stage, please.

08:45.194 --> 08:47.163
Art Soderberg gave you the job.

08:47.230 --> 08:48.323
Yeah, it was a-

08:48.399 --> 08:49.524
It was
the early morning show, right?

08:49.599 --> 08:52.091
<i>Rise and Shine Show.
Wilmer Scott, 5 A.M.</i>

08:52.169 --> 08:53.431
Me and Dusty used to have
an early mornin' show.

08:53.504 --> 08:54.836
Is that right?
Excuse me, partner.

08:54.905 --> 08:56.031
<i>Oh, yeah.
Breakfast at the Bunkhouse.</i>

08:56.106 --> 08:58.506
TV show.
And, uh, it showed mostly...

08:58.576 --> 09:00.169
cartoons and stuff.
Remember that?

09:00.245 --> 09:01.871
- Oh, yeah?
- For the kids.

09:01.946 --> 09:05.280
Well, this was-uh, this came on
at 5:00 in the morning.

09:05.349 --> 09:06.317
And it was-uh, like a gospel show.

09:06.384 --> 09:08.284
- Inspirational show.
- Inspirational show.

09:08.352 --> 09:09.614
Wilmer Scott was the host of it.

09:09.687 --> 09:12.179
Wasn't Wilmer Scott the famous aviator?

09:12.256 --> 09:13.450
No.

09:13.524 --> 09:16.961
Yeah. First man to fly the length
of the Mississippi solo.

09:17.029 --> 09:18.257
- No.
- I don't think so.

09:18.330 --> 09:19.423
Right.

09:19.498 --> 09:20.863
That was his brother Wilbur Scott.

09:20.933 --> 09:22.058
We're now at three minutes...

09:22.134 --> 09:24.467
Flew from New Orleans to Memphis...

09:24.537 --> 09:27.166
all the way up to Minnesota
to Lake Itasca.

09:27.241 --> 09:28.332
And when he got up there,
he tried to fire a signal rocket...

09:28.408 --> 09:30.239
out the cockpit window,
but it was closed.

09:30.309 --> 09:34.370
He became the first civilian pilot
to shoot himself down.

09:34.447 --> 09:35.540
- Ugh!
- No. That was Wilbur.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.708
- You made that story up.
- Right.

09:36.784 --> 09:37.875
No, I'm talking
about Wilmer Scott.

09:37.950 --> 09:40.350
Crashed into the lake
at his moment of triumph.

09:40.420 --> 09:41.410
- No.
- Wilmer.

09:41.488 --> 09:44.253
- Wilmer. Yeah. He was the host...
- No. This was the-

09:44.324 --> 09:45.916
<i>- Right.
- The Rise and Shine Show.</i>

09:45.993 --> 09:47.290
<i>Rise and Shine.</i>

09:47.361 --> 09:50.296
Mr. Keillor, Al's on the verge
of a coronary up there.

09:50.364 --> 09:51.457
Yeah. I'm there.

09:51.533 --> 09:52.625
Now, how did he have time
to fly and do radio?

09:52.701 --> 09:53.794
G.K., sit down.
I gotta do your makeup.

09:53.868 --> 09:56.199
You're thinking of Wilbur Scott, see?

09:56.270 --> 09:57.260
Yeah. It's not the same person.
Not the same person.

09:57.338 --> 09:58.463
- Yeah...
- He was dead.

09:58.539 --> 10:00.701
You know, we used
to have a dog in the act...

10:00.775 --> 10:02.766
when Wanda and Connie were in it...

10:02.844 --> 10:04.972
- and that dog would sing-
- Ooo!

10:05.047 --> 10:06.240
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha!

10:06.314 --> 10:09.250
We'd sing this old song
and he would howl! Ha ha ha!

10:09.317 --> 10:11.081
Oh, my God, that was a dog.

10:11.154 --> 10:13.087
- I been thinkin' about him all day long.
- Yeah.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.679
Rusty always comes to my mind.

10:14.758 --> 10:15.850
Does it?

10:15.927 --> 10:18.587

10:18.661 --> 10:21.528

§ Go tell Aunt Gladys §

10:22.698 --> 10:24.723

10:33.711 --> 10:34.973

- Right on cue.

10:35.046 --> 10:36.307

- Bow wow wow!

10:36.379 --> 10:38.040

10:39.349 --> 10:40.782
I don't know if we were
harmonizing with him...

10:40.852 --> 10:42.218

11:06.447 --> 11:07.537
Oh!

11:07.613 --> 11:08.705

11:08.781 --> 11:09.874
Oh! Uh-oh, my gosh!

11:09.949 --> 11:11.746
I can feel it!
My baby's coming out!

11:11.818 --> 11:15.412
It's going to come out on
this dirty make-up room floor!

11:15.487 --> 11:17.479
Oh! Oh! Whoa!

11:17.557 --> 11:18.649
Just take it easy.

11:18.725 --> 11:20.454
Just kidding.

11:20.528 --> 11:22.325
- Ohh! You-
- You phony!

11:22.396 --> 11:23.954
Get her up out of there.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.499
You were fakin'?!
I was callin' 911!

11:26.567 --> 11:27.795
I'm sorry.
They just wouldn't pay attention.

11:27.868 --> 11:29.802
- I had to think of something...
- I'm going to work.

11:29.870 --> 11:30.962
- Oh!
- Didn't mean to scare you, Donna.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.596
Wilmer Scott.

11:32.673 --> 11:33.833
- Let's go.
- Garrison!

11:33.908 --> 11:35.467
Wilmer Scott was the one
who hypnotized the chickens...

11:35.543 --> 11:37.135
- There you go.
- on the show.

11:37.210 --> 11:39.179
He did like, what,
four of those chickens in a row.

11:39.247 --> 11:41.340
- Four or five of them.
- Who was Wilmer Scott?

11:41.416 --> 11:44.010
<i>He was the host of that
Rise and Shine Show.</i>

11:44.085 --> 11:45.643
Early in the morning. 5 A.M.

11:45.719 --> 11:47.882
That's, uh, what, uh,
G.K. got started in radio.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.048
Right. Gospel show.

11:49.124 --> 11:50.387
And he hypnotized chickens
on the radio?

11:50.459 --> 11:52.484
No, but he did
the chickens on this show.

11:52.562 --> 11:53.654
On this show?

11:53.729 --> 11:54.821
<i>Not on that Rise and Shine Show.</i>

11:54.898 --> 11:56.228
OK.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.926
All right, let's dim the house lights.

11:58.000 --> 11:58.968
You remember when
he did those chickens?

11:59.035 --> 12:00.399
- Hypnotized them?
- Yep.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.435
Chinese chickens, right?

12:01.504 --> 12:02.766
Kung Pao, I believe.

12:02.839 --> 12:04.329
With the little-didn't they have a little-

12:04.408 --> 12:05.465

12:05.541 --> 12:07.304

12:07.376 --> 12:08.469
Pisca what?

12:08.545 --> 12:10.569
<i>The sponsor. 5 A.M.

12:10.647 --> 12:11.613
What was it called?

12:11.681 --> 12:12.649
Made of buffalo grass-

12:12.715 --> 12:13.944
And thirty seconds to broadcast, please.

12:14.017 --> 12:16.348
Sassafras, and natural grain alcohol.

12:16.420 --> 12:17.511
What was it called?

12:17.587 --> 12:18.680
Piscacadawadaquoddymoggin.

12:18.755 --> 12:19.847
No, it's
Piscacadawadaquoddymoggin.

12:19.923 --> 12:21.016
- Places, please.
- OK. Places.

12:21.092 --> 12:22.183
That's what I said.

12:22.259 --> 12:23.954

12:29.968 --> 12:31.765
It was what Wilmer Scott
had in his coffee cup-

12:31.836 --> 12:33.360
- Uh-huh.
- every morning.

12:33.437 --> 12:34.735
- 5 A.M.
- Right here.

12:34.806 --> 12:35.773
Then he quit drinking.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.240
- Uh-huh. OK.
- And he lost interest in radio.

12:38.309 --> 12:39.503
Check your barn doors.

12:39.577 --> 12:40.840
He developed mic fright.

12:40.913 --> 12:42.072
How did he quit drinkin'?

12:42.146 --> 12:43.136
He just quit.

12:43.315 --> 12:45.408
- And we're on.
- Then he raised chickens.

12:45.484 --> 12:47.952

13:23.558 --> 13:25.355
Hello, everybody,
on a Saturday night...

13:25.426 --> 13:27.190
and welcome to a live broadcast...

13:27.262 --> 13:29.457
<i>of A Prairie Home Companion
coming to you...</i>

13:29.532 --> 13:33.092
from WLT,
your friendly neighbor station.

13:33.702 --> 13:35.397
Noir, where you been?

13:35.470 --> 13:37.405
I was lookin' after the Johnson Girls.

13:37.472 --> 13:39.201
OK. Aren't you supposed
to be guarding the door?

13:39.274 --> 13:40.366
Are you worried about something?

13:40.442 --> 13:43.106
Uh, I had a weird call
from some crazy lady, so-

13:43.179 --> 13:44.646
Oh, she's not that crazy.

13:44.713 --> 13:45.976
How do you know?

13:46.049 --> 13:47.346
Because I met her
earlier this afternoon.

13:47.417 --> 13:48.748
She came by.

13:48.818 --> 13:51.982
What does she look like?
You get a description?

13:52.056 --> 13:53.454
Yeah, I got a description.

13:53.524 --> 13:54.615
Yeah?

13:54.691 --> 13:55.920
She was beautiful.

13:55.993 --> 14:00.692
Her hair was what God had in mind
when he said, let there be-

14:00.764 --> 14:02.493
Hair. Right. Hair.

14:02.565 --> 14:05.467
Hair. Yeah.

14:05.536 --> 14:07.060
She gave me a smile so sweet...

14:07.137 --> 14:09.504
you could've poured it
on your pancakes.

14:09.574 --> 14:12.168
She was wearing a white
trench coat so white...

14:12.243 --> 14:15.234
that rain would be
embarrassed to fall on it.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.746
Got it. Right.

14:16.815 --> 14:17.976
The skirt she was
wearing was so tight...

14:18.050 --> 14:21.040
you could read
the embroidery on her underwear.

14:21.119 --> 14:27.855
It said, "Wash in lukewarm water
and spin lightly. "

14:27.927 --> 14:29.518
OK, you're makin' it up.

14:29.594 --> 14:34.259
She had a Mount Rushmore t-shirt on,
and those guys never looked so good.

14:34.334 --> 14:36.199
Especially Jefferson and Lincoln.

14:36.269 --> 14:37.394
Right.

14:37.470 --> 14:40.440
Kind of bloated but happy.

14:40.507 --> 14:42.939
- If you know what I mean.
- Yeah.

14:43.009 --> 14:45.877
It was an honor just to sit there
and inhale the same air...

14:45.946 --> 14:49.005
that she had so recently exhaled...

14:49.081 --> 14:53.678
just to exchange the atmosphere
between us, so to speak.

14:53.754 --> 14:54.846
Look, what did she want?

14:54.921 --> 14:56.320
Did she say anything about-

14:56.391 --> 14:57.482
Who?

14:57.557 --> 14:59.149
The lady.

14:59.226 --> 15:02.253
Oh. She was looking for
the Presbyterian Church.

15:02.330 --> 15:04.265
Like a dope,
I told her where it was.

15:04.332 --> 15:07.324
And out of my life she went, just as...

15:07.402 --> 15:09.996
quickly and erotically
as she had entered it.

15:14.042 --> 15:15.805
Are you tired
of your current herring?

15:17.678 --> 15:20.204
Has it lost that certain
something that you expect...

15:20.282 --> 15:21.613
in a pickled fish product?

15:23.652 --> 15:26.382
If so, maybe it's time you try Jens Jenson.

15:26.455 --> 15:31.758
It's the Lake Superior herring that's made
the old-fashioned Norwegian way.

15:39.736 --> 15:44.106
C- can someone turn it down, please?
Please?

15:44.175 --> 15:47.473
§ Yeah, Jenson Herring is the best §

15:47.544 --> 15:48.710
Oh, Jens Jenson's.

15:48.746 --> 15:50.680
- Please.
- Ask for it by name.

15:50.747 --> 15:53.581
And if your grocer doesn't stock it,
ask him why not.

15:53.651 --> 15:55.243
You know what I'm gonna do?

15:55.319 --> 15:57.947
I'm gonna color my hair
strawberry blonde.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.184
Hey.

15:59.256 --> 16:01.622
I swear to God, I should
have done it years ago.

16:01.692 --> 16:02.659
I should have broke loose...

16:02.727 --> 16:05.058
gone to Chicago
when Mama died back then.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.620
That's what I should have done.

16:06.698 --> 16:08.462
You know, you put those things off.

16:08.533 --> 16:10.900
You seldom get around to them again.

16:10.969 --> 16:13.494
Hmm. What are you writin'?

16:13.572 --> 16:14.732
Poem.

16:14.806 --> 16:16.206
Oh, a poem.

16:16.274 --> 16:18.640
What's it about?

16:18.710 --> 16:20.235
Heh. Suicide.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.110
Oh, my God.

16:22.181 --> 16:25.048
Oh. OK.

16:25.119 --> 16:27.383
Well, you know what my philosophy is.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.751
Yes, I do, so don't tell me.

16:31.291 --> 16:35.352
I think that you gotta be grateful
for everything that happens to you...

16:35.429 --> 16:38.159
because that's what
got you here, you know?

16:38.232 --> 16:41.066
And if you hadn't gone through
all the things that you went through...

16:41.136 --> 16:43.365
why, you know,
you wouldn't have wound up...

16:43.438 --> 16:47.238
where you are now, so,
I don't know.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.569
Disappointment doesn't
get you anywhere.

16:48.642 --> 16:49.611
Anywhere.

16:49.677 --> 16:51.269
Aren't you wonderful?

16:51.346 --> 16:54.576
Well, one door closes
and another one opens...

16:54.648 --> 16:59.178
then, you know, everything is
a step along the way...

16:59.255 --> 17:01.223
and it all leads to something else.

17:01.290 --> 17:04.622
Pardon me if I don't
get down on my knees.

17:04.692 --> 17:07.992
Well, that's what I think.

17:08.063 --> 17:10.998
Ahem. Read me some of your poem.

17:11.067 --> 17:12.328
It's not finished.

17:12.401 --> 17:13.630

20:30.511 --> 20:31.706
Thank you, boys.

20:33.683 --> 20:36.708
And the next week, we're back
doin' the county fair circuit...

20:36.786 --> 20:38.844
changin' our petticoats
in the ladies' toilet...

20:38.920 --> 20:40.353
and the boys tryin' to peek in.

20:40.423 --> 20:41.720
Ha ha ha!

20:41.791 --> 20:43.258
That was the only
good part about it.

20:43.327 --> 20:45.522
Then you have to go outdoors
and sing in the open air...

20:45.596 --> 20:48.087
with a cloud of mosquitoes
around your head.

20:48.165 --> 20:51.464
Remember that time-
honestly, Lola, honest to God-

20:51.535 --> 20:53.331
a dragonfly flew right in my mouth.

20:53.403 --> 20:54.392
Oh, yeah!

20:54.470 --> 20:57.201
It was this big.
I thought it was a bird.

20:57.274 --> 20:58.264
How old were you then?

20:58.342 --> 21:01.072
I was thirteen.
Your mother was ten.

21:01.145 --> 21:02.340
Wanda was what?

21:02.413 --> 21:06.111
Wanda was sixteen.
Connie, fifteen.

21:06.184 --> 21:07.674
Yep.

21:07.752 --> 21:09.686
That was the end of it.
The end of the road.

21:09.754 --> 21:12.052
That was a great-

21:12.123 --> 21:14.421
You know, Wanda took it
real hard, didn't she?

21:14.492 --> 21:16.892
A week later, she got arrested.

21:16.961 --> 21:19.191
For what?
You never told me this.

21:19.264 --> 21:21.562
Shoplifting, and I did tell you this.

21:21.633 --> 21:24.159
Mom, you're going senile.
You didn't tell me that.

21:24.236 --> 21:25.202
No...

21:25.270 --> 21:27.170
She was havin'
a cup of coffee in the cafe.

21:27.238 --> 21:28.501
She ordered a glazed doughnut.

21:28.574 --> 21:31.304
She started eatin' it
and she got a sugar rush.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.744
She was diagnosed hypoglycemic.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.781
And so, she forgets
she didn't pay for the doughnut...

21:35.848 --> 21:37.008
and she walks out the door.

21:37.082 --> 21:39.017
- It wasn't two minutes-
- But they arrested her for shopliftin'.

21:39.085 --> 21:41.951
The red lights are flashin'
and she's in handcuffs...

21:42.022 --> 21:43.613
- And they had a policeman there.
- And the cameras, the TV camera-

21:43.690 --> 21:46.022
- the station came right down.
- It was on the news.

21:46.092 --> 21:48.323
And her hair is, like, stickin' out like this
and she's bawlin'...

21:48.396 --> 21:50.488
and Daddy sees it
on the 10:00 newscast.

21:50.565 --> 21:52.430
'Cause he was
in the hospital with Mama.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.990
She was havin' her tubes tied
after Johnny was born.

21:55.068 --> 21:56.036
Thank you.

21:56.104 --> 21:58.503
- Didn't need to know that.
- Well.

21:58.573 --> 22:03.067
Daddy sees Wanda gettin' arrested
on TV for shoplifting.

22:03.144 --> 22:05.043
He has a major coronary occlusion.

22:05.112 --> 22:06.238
Yeah.

22:06.314 --> 22:09.181
He just climbed up into
the hospital bed with Mama...

22:09.251 --> 22:11.879
then he pulled the sheet
up over his own face...

22:11.953 --> 22:13.888
and when the nurse came in,
he was dead.

22:13.956 --> 22:16.220
That was it.
You know?

22:16.292 --> 22:20.023
He left a note, 'cause Wanda got
released from jail just for the funeral.

22:20.096 --> 22:23.587
He said, "Wanda, you broke my heart.
Signed, Daddy. "

22:23.665 --> 22:26.658
She did thirty days
for one glazed doughnut.

22:26.736 --> 22:29.899
A 59-cent doughnut.
If it had been rock and roll...

22:29.973 --> 22:31.907
she could have
thrown sofas out of the window-

22:31.975 --> 22:34.135
hotel window.
No, not even her own sofa.

22:34.210 --> 22:36.679
She could throw somebody else's sofa
out the window.

22:36.747 --> 22:38.874
You don't know what kind
of passersby at the bottom.

22:38.949 --> 22:40.883
She could have been hittin' people.
It wouldn't have mattered.

22:40.951 --> 22:43.885
But when you're playin' to
Christian family audiences like we were...

22:43.953 --> 22:45.944
you so much as forget to pay
for a damn doughnut...

22:46.022 --> 22:48.185
they throw you out like
a piece of garbage.

22:48.259 --> 22:50.990
Sooner kill you than look at you.

22:51.062 --> 22:53.155
Some of those good people, eh?

22:53.231 --> 22:56.722
The Soderberg family selling out!

22:56.800 --> 22:59.066
I just do not get it.

22:59.137 --> 23:00.764
I mean, they've owned WLT...

23:00.839 --> 23:03.274
since they ran it
out of a sandwich shop.

23:03.341 --> 23:05.241
I mean, that's what the call letters
stand for, you know.

23:05.310 --> 23:07.575
"With Lettuce and Tomato. "
Did you know that?

23:07.646 --> 23:09.808
I mean, how do you just walk away
from somethin' like that?

23:09.882 --> 23:11.610
I mean, what are we?
Used Kleenex?

23:11.683 --> 23:13.707
They got old, babe.

23:13.785 --> 23:16.984
They started thinking
about ease and comfort.

23:17.057 --> 23:22.153
Then, I figure, they saw a brochure
about an island with palm trees...

23:22.228 --> 23:26.324
and an azure sky
and miles of sand...

23:26.399 --> 23:28.561
and they thought, "Hey! Ha ha!

23:28.635 --> 23:33.072
"We don't have to suffer through
these miserable Minnesota winters.

23:33.139 --> 23:36.576
"We don't have to freeze our butts off
waiting for our bus to come.

23:36.643 --> 23:41.343
"Our bus has come. It's here.
We'll leave the business to the kids...

23:41.416 --> 23:44.111
"and we'll head for paradise
and to hell with it. "

23:44.184 --> 23:45.152
Only trouble is...

23:45.219 --> 23:48.655
the kids had already gone down
to paradise ahead of them.

23:48.724 --> 23:51.192
So then, a big corporation
down in Texas...

23:51.259 --> 23:54.285
offered them
a gazillion dollars for it.

23:54.362 --> 23:56.226
Texans.

23:56.297 --> 23:57.856
Sure.

23:57.933 --> 23:59.730
They talk funny
and their eyes don't focus...

23:59.802 --> 24:02.771
and their flesh is rotting
and falling off...

24:02.837 --> 24:06.968
but hey. You know. So what?

24:07.042 --> 24:11.412
Yeah, nobody's perfect and, uh...
money is money...

24:11.481 --> 24:13.949
so, the Soderbergs took the dough.
End of story.

24:14.017 --> 24:15.608
Do you have any tweezers?

24:15.684 --> 24:19.018
Egg salad or ham salad?

24:19.088 --> 24:20.716
Why are you crying?

24:20.790 --> 24:23.351
Well, it's the last show.

24:23.427 --> 24:27.056
I'm never going to see
these people again.

24:27.131 --> 24:28.224
You'll see them again.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.166
I knew all of them from the old days.

24:31.234 --> 24:35.228
Soupy and Red, Ray.

24:35.306 --> 24:38.003
And Helen.

24:38.076 --> 24:40.271
Gone and forgotten.

24:40.345 --> 24:42.607
Every sparrow is remembered.

24:45.383 --> 24:48.819
I don't even know if they're gonna
make a speech or anything.

24:48.887 --> 24:51.185
It doesn't seem right, does it?

24:51.256 --> 24:52.223
No.

24:52.291 --> 24:56.455
Some big company come in
and steps on us...

24:56.529 --> 24:58.860
like we were bugs at the picnic.

25:03.436 --> 25:06.404
What's in ham salad?

25:06.472 --> 25:11.341
I- I can't remember the word. It was...

25:11.411 --> 25:13.777
May I...

25:13.847 --> 25:15.643
Maybe...

25:15.716 --> 25:16.683
Mayo?

25:16.751 --> 25:21.949
Mayonnaise.

25:22.023 --> 25:26.322
Well, it's an end of an era
when this show goes, guys.

25:26.393 --> 25:28.418
There won't be anything left
on the radio except what?

25:28.495 --> 25:31.191
People yellin' at you
and computers playing music.

25:31.265 --> 25:32.791
I mean, it's a tragedy.

25:32.868 --> 25:33.925
I wasn't gonna tell you this...

25:34.002 --> 25:36.528
but between you and me
and the fly on the wall...

25:36.604 --> 25:39.938
there's a woman on the premises who
I think, maybe, is gonna save our bacon.

25:40.009 --> 25:40.998
Hmm?

25:41.077 --> 25:42.476
She's got that look about her.

25:42.545 --> 25:43.533
Who is she?

25:43.611 --> 25:46.307
I'm not sure. I'm still working
on figuring that one out.

25:46.381 --> 25:48.247
Just close your eyes
for a second.

25:48.317 --> 25:50.113
She from NorComm?

25:50.186 --> 25:51.413
Time will tell.

25:51.486 --> 25:56.424
I'll just let personal charm
and dashing good looks do their work.

25:56.493 --> 25:58.757
She walked in,
couldn't take her eyes off me.

25:58.829 --> 26:01.491
Drawn to me like a moth to the flame.

26:01.732 --> 26:03.665
Every time there's
a triumph in the world...

26:03.699 --> 26:06.363
a million souls have to be trampled on.

26:06.437 --> 26:09.201
And right there-you can see it
right in the damn carpet.

26:09.273 --> 26:11.672
What does that have
to do with anything?

26:11.741 --> 26:13.642
Mama. She I-she went-

26:13.710 --> 26:14.870
She went up to the-

26:14.946 --> 26:17.005
It was a lot for Mama to put up with.

26:17.081 --> 26:19.379
We had to shovel her into
the Good Shepherd Home.

26:19.450 --> 26:21.248
That's it.
That was the sad day.

26:21.320 --> 26:22.786
Connie quit the act.

26:22.854 --> 26:24.482
God, we'd already lost Wanda.

26:24.556 --> 26:25.783
Wanda was like magic.

26:25.857 --> 26:27.619
The four of us,
when we were together...

26:27.691 --> 26:28.954
- she was singin'.
- She was-

26:29.026 --> 26:30.858
And next to you, I'm tellin' you...

26:30.929 --> 26:32.191
you've followed in her footsteps.

26:32.264 --> 26:34.459
You are the same-
the same talent.

26:34.533 --> 26:35.898
No. I don't know about that.

26:35.967 --> 26:37.229
So, now, it's just the two of us.

26:37.301 --> 26:38.735
Yep. Just the two of us.

26:38.804 --> 26:42.035
You know what?
It was your dad got us on the radio.

26:42.106 --> 26:44.598
God, that was
a good-lookin' family!

26:44.676 --> 26:46.611
I can understand you
goin' for that guy.

26:46.679 --> 26:48.612
Yeah, he sang like an angel.

26:48.681 --> 26:51.309
He sang...

26:51.384 --> 26:55.753
§ Softly and tenderly §

26:55.823 --> 26:59.417
§ Jesus is calling §

26:59.493 --> 27:06.364
§ Callin' for you and for me §

27:06.432 --> 27:08.798
§ See on the portal §

27:08.869 --> 27:12.806
§ He's waiting and watching §

27:12.873 --> 27:18.971
§ Watching for you and for me §

27:19.046 --> 27:25.379
§ Come home §

27:25.453 --> 27:32.950
§ Ye who are weary, come home §

27:33.028 --> 27:36.294
Hmm-mmm.

27:36.365 --> 27:39.596
Singing is the only thing
that puts me right.

27:39.669 --> 27:43.766
Hmm-mmm.

27:44.440 --> 27:45.965
§ Well, Charlie, you're a good ol' boy §

27:46.009 --> 27:47.737
§ Charlie, you're all right §

27:47.810 --> 27:49.369
§ Charlie, open up the store §

27:49.446 --> 27:51.242
§ We're comin' down tonight §

27:51.315 --> 27:53.078
§ Out where you can see the stars §

27:53.150 --> 27:54.481
§ And the living's slow §

27:54.551 --> 27:56.518
§ We'll eat potluck and pool guitars §

27:56.587 --> 27:58.249
§ Down on Old Plank Road §

27:58.322 --> 27:59.983
§ Ohh §

28:00.057 --> 28:01.525
§ Down on Old Plank Road §

28:01.592 --> 28:03.527
§ We'll eat potluck and pool guitars §

28:03.595 --> 28:05.620
§ Down on Old Plank Road §

28:05.697 --> 28:11.092
§ Come home §

28:11.169 --> 28:18.041
§ Ye who are weary, come home §

28:18.110 --> 28:20.010
Hold it. Are we on?

28:20.080 --> 28:21.137
Uh, not yet.
You've got a few minutes.

28:21.213 --> 28:22.237
What are we doin'?

28:22.314 --> 28:25.977
<i>You're on in the Powdermilk segment
doing Gold Watch and Chain with him.</i>

28:26.052 --> 28:28.679
We haven't done that for years.

28:28.754 --> 28:33.124
§ I'll pawn you my gold watch
and chain, love §

28:33.192 --> 28:36.720
§ I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring... §

28:36.796 --> 28:37.763
Excuse me.

28:37.831 --> 28:40.129
I gotta get a head start
on gettin' pie-eyed tonight.

28:40.200 --> 28:43.362
§ This heart in my bosom §

28:43.435 --> 28:48.500
§ Only say that you'll love me again §

28:48.576 --> 28:50.042
<i>How about Red River Valley?</i>

28:50.111 --> 28:52.808
Fine. Whatever you'd like.

28:52.880 --> 28:58.342
I would just like there to be
a spot for Lola on the show later.

28:58.419 --> 29:02.014
I hope so.
If there's time.

29:02.090 --> 29:04.854
Well, this isn't really gonna be
your last show, is it?

29:04.928 --> 29:06.896
Every show's your last show.

29:06.962 --> 29:08.792
That's my philosophy.

29:08.864 --> 29:12.391
Thank you, Plato.
Kierkegaard.

29:13.802 --> 29:15.168
Button up, would ya?

29:15.238 --> 29:17.728
I am. That's as far as it goes.

29:21.377 --> 29:23.140
§ Well, sister and her oldest girl §

29:23.212 --> 29:25.077
§ They sing so good together §

29:25.148 --> 29:26.615
§ Jason, he can make me laugh §

29:26.683 --> 29:28.583
§ And he just keeps gettin' better §

29:28.651 --> 29:30.380

29:30.453 --> 29:31.852
§ About her, Timmy-o §

29:31.921 --> 29:33.890
§ And John is everybody's man §

29:33.958 --> 29:35.288
§ Down on Old Plank Road §

29:35.625 --> 29:37.526
§ Ohh §

29:37.594 --> 29:38.924
§ Down on Old Plank Road §

29:38.996 --> 29:45.027
Hey, uh... can you tell potato face here
that his butt is too big for his pants...

29:45.103 --> 29:47.128
and people can see his crack...

29:47.205 --> 29:50.299
and it ain't nothin' any normal person
would ever care to look at?

29:50.375 --> 29:51.363
Where?

29:51.443 --> 29:53.967
In the back.
That's where your crack is.

29:54.044 --> 29:55.012
Well, I don't see nothin'.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.548
- Hey, Molly.
- Don't talk to me.

29:57.616 --> 29:58.775
Am I decent back there?

29:58.850 --> 30:01.182
Don't ask me.
I'm not your mother.

30:01.253 --> 30:04.187
You might be decent
if you lost 25 pounds of ugly fat.

30:04.256 --> 30:07.123
And I might suggest
cuttin' off your head.

30:07.193 --> 30:09.456
She showed me her tattoo once.

30:09.528 --> 30:10.893
Hell she did.

30:10.963 --> 30:12.727
On her shoulder.

30:12.797 --> 30:14.425
You're lyin' through your teeth.

30:14.500 --> 30:15.626
Left shoulder.
Right here.

30:15.702 --> 30:17.635
- That ain't the shoulder.
- Whatever you want to call it.

30:17.704 --> 30:18.728
I'd call it the clavicle.

30:18.805 --> 30:19.964
OK, well, why don't you
ask her about it?

30:20.039 --> 30:21.132
Maybe she'll let you have a look.

30:21.208 --> 30:22.800
Well, what did it say?

30:22.876 --> 30:24.069
It said, "Freedom. "

30:24.143 --> 30:26.078
Fr-Now I know you're lyin'.

30:26.145 --> 30:28.580
Come on. We gotta put out the CDs.

30:28.648 --> 30:31.379
Come on, niece.

30:31.452 --> 30:33.442
Hey. Molly.

30:33.520 --> 30:35.421
Molly, here.
Take these out front.

30:35.490 --> 30:39.290
Did you hear about the Soderbergs
sellin' the radio station?

30:39.360 --> 30:41.487
I heard all about it.

30:41.562 --> 30:42.962
Are you OK?

30:43.031 --> 30:46.092
Yes, of course.
Hmm?

30:46.167 --> 30:48.067
Kind of a bizarre feeling, isn't it?

30:48.137 --> 30:50.400
- What?
- The silence.

30:50.471 --> 30:52.336
What?

30:52.407 --> 30:54.432
Well...

30:54.509 --> 30:56.000
you're gonna say somethin' about it.

30:56.079 --> 30:57.478
You're gonna talk
to the people, aren't you?

30:57.547 --> 31:00.309
Say, "Thanks for listening,"
or something.

31:00.381 --> 31:01.576
Yeah, you know.

31:01.650 --> 31:02.639
I don't think so.

31:02.718 --> 31:03.844
Why not?
Say, "Thank you. "

31:03.919 --> 31:05.580
What?

31:05.654 --> 31:08.021
I'm just not into making big speeches.

31:08.091 --> 31:09.319
What do you do when you
leave somebody's house?

31:09.392 --> 31:10.483
You don't just turn around-

31:10.559 --> 31:13.188
I don't make a big speech.
A big weepy speech.

31:13.263 --> 31:17.131
Oh, that's it!
You're afraid that you're gonna cry!

31:17.200 --> 31:18.462
I wouldn't.

31:18.535 --> 31:21.527
Yeah, that's right.
That's true. You wouldn't.

31:21.604 --> 31:25.540
And you know, that's why, I think,
that our romance was so short.

31:25.609 --> 31:28.737
Because I knew that when we broke up,
you would not cry...

31:28.813 --> 31:30.781
so, I got way over it.

31:32.650 --> 31:33.742
Does that make sense to you?

31:33.818 --> 31:34.785
No, not at all.

31:34.852 --> 31:38.913
Bebopareebop Frozen Rhubarb Pie
and Frozen Rhubarb Pie Filling.

31:38.989 --> 31:43.085
Wouldn't this be a good time
for a piece of rhubarb pie?

31:43.161 --> 31:45.653
§ Yes, one little thing can revive a guy §

31:45.730 --> 31:48.028
§ And that is a piece of rhubarb pie §

31:48.100 --> 31:50.569
§ Serve it up, nice and hot §

31:50.636 --> 31:52.866
§ Maybe things aren't
as bad as you thought §

31:52.939 --> 31:55.270
§ Mammy's little baby
loves rhubarb, rhubarb §

31:55.341 --> 31:57.502
§ Bebopareebop Rhubarb Pie §

31:57.577 --> 31:59.909
§ Mama's little baby
loves rhubarb, rhubarb §

31:59.979 --> 32:04.249
§ Bebopareebop Rhubarb Pie §

32:04.317 --> 32:06.877
Yes, Bebopareebop Rhubarb Pie.

32:06.952 --> 32:08.182
And now, for Bebopareebop...

32:08.255 --> 32:11.349
please welcome one of radio's
great singing families...

32:11.425 --> 32:14.292
the Johnson Girls,
Rhonda and Yolanda.

32:15.461 --> 32:17.259
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

32:17.464 --> 32:20.901
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much.

32:20.969 --> 32:24.496
I just want to say right away
how happy I am...

32:24.572 --> 32:28.133
that my daughter Lola
is here tonight.

32:28.209 --> 32:29.540
- Come on, Lola.
- Oh! Thank you, sweetheart.

32:29.612 --> 32:30.636
They want to see you.

32:30.713 --> 32:32.738
It means a lot to me that you came.

32:32.815 --> 32:36.181
Yeah, I named my little girl Lola
after our own mother.

32:36.251 --> 32:37.275
Yeah, Lola was our mom.

32:37.352 --> 32:42.187
Lola. And tonight,
we're gonna sing...

32:42.257 --> 32:45.420
an old song that our mother loved.

32:45.493 --> 32:46.756
Oh, it's one of her favorites.

32:46.829 --> 32:49.821
Yep. She was our inspiration.

32:49.900 --> 32:51.197
Some of you know this story...

32:51.268 --> 32:56.364
but she's the main reason
that we started makin' music originally...

32:56.438 --> 33:00.239
because you know she-

33:00.310 --> 33:02.871
it was the only way we knew
to make her happy.

33:02.947 --> 33:06.747
She'd be down on the kitchen floor
scrubbin' on her knees.

33:06.816 --> 33:09.979
But if you stood in the doorway
and you sang a song that she liked...

33:10.053 --> 33:13.023
why, she would just look up and smile.

33:13.091 --> 33:15.785
Ha ha!
Worn out as she was...

33:15.859 --> 33:19.557
it was a smile as wide
as the Mississippi. Heh heh.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.566
Down at the mouth.

33:22.633 --> 33:25.229
Not so slow, you sons of bitches.
I'll break your necks.

33:25.305 --> 33:26.464
- Yeah.
- I mean it.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.506
And you could see her gold tooth.

33:30.742 --> 33:36.305
§ Way down upon
that old Mississippi River §

33:36.381 --> 33:41.479
§ Not so far away §

33:41.554 --> 33:46.890
§ That's where my folks
have lived forever §

33:46.960 --> 33:52.455
§ And that's where I'm going to stay §

33:52.532 --> 33:58.198
§ I been searchin'
'cross the whole creation §

33:58.271 --> 34:01.673
§ Half my life or more §

34:01.742 --> 34:04.041
§ And more §

34:04.111 --> 34:09.139
§ But I found
my own sweet satisfaction §

34:09.216 --> 34:14.552
§ Right here on that muddy river shore §

34:14.621 --> 34:19.561
§ All the world is so sad and dreary §

34:19.629 --> 34:25.726
§ Everywhere I roam §

34:25.801 --> 34:27.460
- § Oh §
- § Oh, Mama §

34:27.536 --> 34:31.197
§ Mama, how I miss the prairie §

34:31.273 --> 34:37.235
§ And my Minnesota home §

34:37.313 --> 34:42.775
I can see my mama's sweet, sweet face
every Sunday morning.

34:42.853 --> 34:47.449
All the good old hymns, praise God,
that we've sung.

34:47.524 --> 34:52.824
We knelt in prayer right beside
our precious aunts and uncles...

34:52.896 --> 34:58.835
§ Who loved us when we were young §

34:58.902 --> 35:01.166
§ In the valley of darkness §

35:01.238 --> 35:04.003
§ They are the shepherds §

35:04.076 --> 35:09.570
§ Who lead me to pastures green §

35:09.647 --> 35:12.013
§ And I'll sit with my mama §

35:12.083 --> 35:15.109
§ By the still, still waters §

35:15.186 --> 35:20.489
§ And goodness and mercy follow me §

35:20.559 --> 35:23.357
§ I floated down §

35:23.429 --> 35:26.159
§ The Columbia and the Hudson §

35:26.232 --> 35:31.692
§ Walked on the banks of the Ohio §

35:31.770 --> 35:34.034
§ On the banks of the Wabash §

35:34.107 --> 35:36.735
§ And the mighty Colorado §

35:36.810 --> 35:42.442
§ And the old Red River way up north §

35:42.515 --> 35:44.107
§ All the world §

35:44.185 --> 35:47.951
§ It is a world of rivers §

35:48.022 --> 35:51.617
§ Flowing to the sea §

35:51.692 --> 35:53.785
§ Yeah §

35:53.861 --> 35:58.231
§ But here on that old Mississippi §

35:58.299 --> 36:02.634
§ Here is the home for you and me §

36:02.704 --> 36:04.036

Heavens, they're tasty.

36:52.757 --> 36:53.984

36:54.057 --> 36:56.686
Also brought to you
by Mel's Big Boy Buffet.

36:56.761 --> 36:58.854
Why pay more for fancy food...

36:58.930 --> 37:02.799
when what you really want
is meatloaf, squash...

37:02.935 --> 37:04.765
mashed potatoes, and bread pudding...

37:04.836 --> 37:08.705
all at Mel's Big Boy Buffet
for just 4.99.

37:08.774 --> 37:10.036
Yes, you heard me right.

37:10.109 --> 37:12.840
$4.99.

37:12.913 --> 37:14.539
Let's bring out Mr. Chuck Akers here...

37:14.613 --> 37:17.549
Mr. Chuck Akers, come out here
and give us a song.

37:17.617 --> 37:20.380
The sweet singer of Kandiyohi County...

37:20.453 --> 37:23.082
the heartthrob
of mature women everywhere.

37:23.156 --> 37:25.522
My good friend, Mr. Chuck Akers.

37:25.593 --> 37:26.683
Good to see you, sir.

37:26.759 --> 37:27.727
Thank you, sir.

37:27.794 --> 37:31.526
Uh, we would like to bring a song
to all of our fans.

37:31.599 --> 37:34.227
Now, that's kind of tough to do,
'cause we're all over the place.

37:34.302 --> 37:36.395
Take me.
Yeah, I've bounced all over.

37:36.471 --> 37:41.569
I've done tent shows, schoolhouses,
uh, parkin' lots...

37:41.643 --> 37:45.237
the back of trucks,
movie theaters, auditoriums.

37:45.313 --> 37:47.076
I've even done churches.

37:47.148 --> 37:48.740
Now, that's hard to believe, I know.

37:48.816 --> 37:50.716
Anyway, this song is for you.

37:50.785 --> 37:53.812
And we mean every word of it,
all right?

37:53.889 --> 37:55.323

38:33.030 --> 38:33.998
- Hey, Lola.
- Hi.

38:34.065 --> 38:36.693
Heard you're gonna sing a song for us,
lookin' forward to that.

38:36.767 --> 38:38.793
Oh, no. I don't-maybe.

38:38.870 --> 38:40.394
Well, it sure would mean
the world to your mom.

38:40.472 --> 38:41.939
She always said you had talent.

38:42.008 --> 38:44.476
Yeah, I don't-I don't really know
any of their songs.

38:44.544 --> 38:45.943
I only know my own songs.

38:46.012 --> 38:47.479
Well, sing one of them then.

38:47.547 --> 38:49.742
They're mostly about death.

38:49.815 --> 38:51.406
Oh.

38:51.483 --> 38:53.951
Well, lotta good songs about death.

38:54.020 --> 38:56.318
All mine are about suicide.

38:56.389 --> 38:58.186
Oh.

38:58.258 --> 39:01.989
Yeah, you know, um,
hangin' yourself with an extension cord...

39:02.062 --> 39:04.825
- carbon monoxide, overdose...
- Hey, ahem...

39:04.898 --> 39:08.664
<i>you know, we could do, uh,
Amazing Grace together.</i>

39:08.735 --> 39:09.894
<i>I know Amazing Grace.</i>

39:09.970 --> 39:11.198
Yeah?
Well, hey, look.

39:11.271 --> 39:13.204
I'll play the guitar,
we'll sing it together...

39:13.273 --> 39:14.239
we'll bring this house down.

39:14.308 --> 39:15.275
You know, I don't know
if you knew this...

39:15.343 --> 39:17.242
- about my friend Dusty here-
- Hey, hey.

39:17.311 --> 39:20.076
But he learned to sing gospel music
in San Quentin.

39:20.148 --> 39:21.376
And full shush.

39:21.449 --> 39:22.438
Yes sir, that's where I met him.

39:22.517 --> 39:24.040
I was with Johnny Cash,
singin' in prisons.

39:24.118 --> 39:25.176
Shut the pie hole.

39:25.252 --> 39:26.686
There were all these
heinous, depraved criminals...

39:26.754 --> 39:28.779
- And well-
- Liar, liar. Whatever, moron.

39:28.856 --> 39:29.949
<i>He sang Amazing Grace...</i>

39:30.024 --> 39:32.686
and it almost made you forget
what he'd done.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.227
Which I don't wanna talk about.

39:34.296 --> 39:36.730
You know, you are so dumb,
you may be twins.

39:36.799 --> 39:39.426
He made me promise on a Bible
that I would never tell, and I won't.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.731
So let that be the end of it.
Let me just say this, though.

39:41.804 --> 39:43.498
Watch out for hugs.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.033
Heh!

39:46.107 --> 39:47.370
Right.

39:47.444 --> 39:49.310
§ If ever I §

39:49.379 --> 39:51.778

40:09.300 --> 40:10.459
Thank you, G.K.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.795
Mr. Chuck Akers!

40:13.870 --> 40:15.430
Thank you, Chuck.

40:15.507 --> 40:17.098
Robin and Linda Williams.

40:17.508 --> 40:19.340
Let's come in here now
with a word about ketchup.

40:19.411 --> 40:23.404
Yes, ketchup, made from tomatoes
that contain natural sunshine...

40:23.481 --> 40:25.915
which we need in this part
of the country.

40:25.983 --> 40:27.418
We are not a sunshiny people.

40:27.487 --> 40:29.785
We're not a paradise people
or a beach people.

40:29.856 --> 40:31.346
We are dark people.

40:31.424 --> 40:33.585
People who believed it could be worse.

40:33.660 --> 40:35.890
And we're waiting
for it to become worse.

40:35.961 --> 40:38.429
We come from people
who brought us up to believe...

40:38.497 --> 40:40.557
that life is a struggle...

40:40.633 --> 40:42.760
and if you should
ever feel really happy...

40:42.835 --> 40:45.167
be patient. This will pass.

40:45.238 --> 40:46.397
- Ha ha ha.
- So we could...

40:46.471 --> 40:47.440
When do you guys go on?

40:47.507 --> 40:51.808
As soon as ol' spud butt here
shuts his yapper.

40:51.879 --> 40:53.073
Thanks for the encouragement.

40:53.147 --> 40:55.115
Hey, you are gonna be great.
Give me a hug.

40:55.181 --> 40:55.910
All right, guys.

40:56.215 --> 40:57.444
More show in just a moment...

40:57.518 --> 41:00.113
but let's come in here now
with a word about shoes!

41:00.187 --> 41:02.314
That's Guy's Shoes. Boys...

41:02.389 --> 41:04.789
§ Talkin' shoes §

41:04.858 --> 41:06.587
§ Talkin' Guy's §

41:06.660 --> 41:10.596
§ Any two, any size §

41:10.664 --> 41:12.758
§ From your ankles to your toes §

41:12.834 --> 41:14.768
§ At the bottom of your clothes §

41:14.835 --> 41:16.632
§ You're talkin' shoes §

41:16.704 --> 41:18.195
§ Talkin' Guy's §

41:19.375 --> 41:21.309
Yes, Guy's Shoes.
They're made to last.

41:21.377 --> 41:24.347
Ask about those Guy's Cash Shoes,
with the hole in the soles...

41:24.412 --> 41:27.314
so you stash your cash
when you're out on the trail.

41:27.383 --> 41:28.509
Isn't that right, Lefty?

41:28.584 --> 41:29.882
That's where I keep mine, G.K.

41:29.951 --> 41:31.316
All right.
Let's welcome 'em now...

41:31.387 --> 41:32.877
the old trail hands here...

41:32.955 --> 41:36.392
the Pachelbels of the prairie,
the Brahmses of the bunkhouse...

41:36.460 --> 41:38.155
here they are,
Dusty and Lefty.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.162
- Good to have you with us.
- Well, thank you, Garrison.

41:40.230 --> 41:41.858
Yes sir, it's good to be back on the show...

41:41.933 --> 41:44.764
because, you know, it gets
mighty lonesome out there on the prairie.

41:44.835 --> 41:47.464
And a cowboy gets
tired of scenery after a while.

41:47.538 --> 41:50.597
You get, well,
sceneried out, and uh...

41:50.673 --> 41:54.132
sort of wish you had
somebody to talk to.

41:54.211 --> 41:55.179
Somebody smart.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.213
- Hmm.
- Ha ha ha.

41:56.280 --> 41:59.772
So you're lonesome for people, huh?

41:59.852 --> 42:01.682
Well, you know, it's true, Garrison.

42:01.753 --> 42:05.189
And, uh, it-it ain't the same
just talkin' to your horse.

42:05.255 --> 42:07.020
My horse is extremely smart.

42:07.092 --> 42:09.390
Uh, he knows math.

42:09.461 --> 42:12.021
He knows physics and chemistry...

42:12.097 --> 42:14.327
but I can't seem
to teach him philosophy.

42:14.399 --> 42:16.026
Can't teach him philosophy, eh?

42:16.101 --> 42:18.365
Well, no. You can't put Descartes
before the horse.

42:18.437 --> 42:19.405
- Aw...
- Ha ha ha.

42:19.471 --> 42:20.599
That was a good one, you know?

42:21.775 --> 42:24.039
Well, what do you reckon
we sing a song, Dusty?

42:24.110 --> 42:25.371
Well, let's do it, Lefty.

42:25.444 --> 42:27.344
One, two, you know what to do.

42:32.620 --> 42:34.484
§ I'm just an old cowboy §

42:34.554 --> 42:36.386
§ With twigs in my hair §

42:36.457 --> 42:38.448
§ Two-thirds alligator §

42:38.526 --> 42:40.516
§ And three-quarters bear §

42:40.594 --> 42:42.653
§ And one half a lion §

42:42.729 --> 42:44.494
§ But let it be known §

42:44.566 --> 42:46.396
§ I never told one lie §

42:46.466 --> 42:48.094
§ That was not my own §

42:48.169 --> 42:50.433
§ Whoopi-ti-yi-yo §

42:50.504 --> 42:54.636
§ Get along, little dogie §

42:54.709 --> 42:56.609
§ I eat when I'm hungry §

42:56.678 --> 42:58.475
§ I'll drink when I'm dry §

42:58.547 --> 43:00.412
§ Don't boss me or cross me §

43:00.482 --> 43:02.177
§ Or I'll spit in your eye §

43:02.250 --> 43:04.081
§ I think what I please §

43:04.153 --> 43:06.451
§ And I say what I mean §

43:06.522 --> 43:08.250
§ And I think all you women §

43:08.323 --> 43:10.258
§ Are the finest I've seen §

43:10.326 --> 43:12.351
§ Whoopi-ti-yi-yo... §

43:12.428 --> 43:15.023
So my mom said, um...

43:15.098 --> 43:16.998
my mom said, you got into radio...

43:17.066 --> 43:20.968
uh, when someone was flying a kite
whose clothes came off? Ha.

43:21.037 --> 43:23.131
A naked man flying.
Quite a sight.

43:23.207 --> 43:25.106
Why didn't he pull his shorts up?

43:26.542 --> 43:29.536
He was hanging on to the kite,
couldn't let go.

43:29.614 --> 43:31.240
- He was up high.
- Ha.

43:31.315 --> 43:33.284
A hundred feet up in the air...

43:33.351 --> 43:34.942
fifty.

43:35.018 --> 43:36.383
Ha.

43:36.454 --> 43:38.580
So, how did that get you into radio?

43:38.655 --> 43:40.850
Well, that was how I met your dad.

43:41.893 --> 43:43.019
Here comes the solo.

43:52.504 --> 43:54.528
Yeah, real good.
Real good.

43:54.606 --> 43:56.131
- Wait, naked guy...
- Yeah?

43:56.208 --> 43:57.436
- Was my dad?
- Right.

43:57.509 --> 43:58.840
Ha.

43:58.911 --> 44:02.676
Naked man with red swim trunks
around his ankles.

44:02.748 --> 44:04.442
Couple thousand people saw it...

44:04.517 --> 44:06.814
so we figured it was a good time
to leave town...

44:06.887 --> 44:10.448
so we got a car,
and we headed down to Chicago.

44:10.523 --> 44:11.490
§ We ride in the snow §

44:11.558 --> 44:13.685
§ And we ride in the rain §

44:13.760 --> 44:15.557
§ Just like Gene Autry §

44:15.629 --> 44:17.893
§ Just like John Wayne §

44:17.965 --> 44:19.591
§ They were better cowboys §

44:19.666 --> 44:21.396
§ Than us and I mean it §

44:21.469 --> 44:23.265
§ But we are still livin' §

44:23.336 --> 44:25.328
§ And that is convenient §

44:25.406 --> 44:26.464
§ Huh! §

44:26.540 --> 44:28.098
§ Pi-ti-yi-yo §

44:28.175 --> 44:31.509
§ Get along, little dogie §

44:31.579 --> 44:32.546
§ Huh! §

44:32.613 --> 44:34.012
§ Pi-ti-yi-yo §

44:34.081 --> 44:38.075
§ Get along, little dogies §

44:40.289 --> 44:41.984
I go in to pay for the gas...

44:42.024 --> 44:44.857
and he wakes up and decides
he needs to use the men's room.

44:44.926 --> 44:46.758
So I come back.

44:46.828 --> 44:49.296
I think he's still sleeping
in the back seat...

44:49.364 --> 44:53.300
and I get behind the wheel,
and I drive to Chicago.

44:53.369 --> 44:54.699
I leave him there in Oshkosh.

44:54.770 --> 45:00.004
And he goes into the cafe,
and your mother was the waitress.

45:00.076 --> 45:01.099
That's how they met.

45:01.176 --> 45:03.269
That's how I came to be born.

45:03.345 --> 45:06.747
Well, it kind of led to that, yeah.

45:06.816 --> 45:09.046
Yeah, but I mean if you had
looked in the back seat...

45:09.119 --> 45:11.712
and-and seen that he wasn't there,
I wouldn't exist.

45:11.789 --> 45:16.556
Well, he and I weren't getting along
that well, so that's why.

45:17.962 --> 45:19.053
That's really strange.

45:19.129 --> 45:22.462
Well, no. I think it's one...

45:22.533 --> 45:25.023
of the most beautiful things
I ever did not do.

45:28.206 --> 45:31.333
So how'd you get into radio then?

45:31.408 --> 45:34.345
<i>Well, there was a show called, uh,
The Baked Bean Jubilee.</i>

45:34.412 --> 45:36.347
- Yeah, with my dad.
- With your dad, right.

45:36.415 --> 45:38.405
- Happy Baked Beans.
- Happy Baked Beans, you know?

45:38.483 --> 45:40.782
§ Happy Baked Beans §

45:40.853 --> 45:41.820
§ Are nutritious §

45:41.886 --> 45:42.855
Shh! Keep your voices down!

45:42.922 --> 45:45.082
§ Made the natural way §

45:45.156 --> 45:47.591
- Keep your voices down!
- § Made of natural fiber §

45:47.660 --> 45:48.627
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

45:48.694 --> 45:50.594
§ Try some, you will say §

45:50.663 --> 45:52.598
- There's a show going on!
- § They are nature's fruit §

45:52.666 --> 45:54.827
§ Root-ti-toot-toot-toot §

45:54.901 --> 45:56.926
§ Try baked beans §

45:57.004 --> 46:00.804
§ Every day §

46:21.163 --> 46:22.789
§ Ooh, baby §

46:22.865 --> 46:24.421
- § You're my man §
- Mmm. Hmm!

46:24.499 --> 46:26.991
§ Ahh, ooh, you do what- §

46:27.402 --> 46:28.870
Let's come in here now
with some cards and letters...

46:28.904 --> 46:31.372
from the friends
and neighbors out there.

46:31.439 --> 46:33.806
So good to know that
you're out there listening.

46:33.876 --> 46:36.743
Here's a little note here from Aaron...

46:36.813 --> 46:39.042
who says our show is a source
of comfort and laughter for him.

46:39.114 --> 46:41.447
- And he's hoping-
- And he's hopin' that the Johnson Girls-

46:41.518 --> 46:42.609
he's goin' to hear them
shake their hips a little...

46:42.684 --> 46:45.381
<i>and sing Touch me,
Kiss me, Be my man.</i>

46:45.455 --> 46:47.388
No, he was just joking, he says.

46:47.457 --> 46:48.548
Just joking about that.

46:48.624 --> 46:51.650
<i>He was hoping that we would sing, uh,
Gold Watch and Chain.</i>

46:51.727 --> 46:52.888
- Oh. Oh, I bet.
- Yolanda.

46:52.963 --> 46:54.190
Yolanda and I.

46:54.264 --> 46:55.788
So let's bring up Yolanda here.

46:55.864 --> 46:59.097
<i>This beautiful old song
Gold Watch and Chain. Boys.</i>

47:04.742 --> 47:09.442
§ Darlin', how can I stay
here without you? §

47:09.514 --> 47:14.211
§ I have nothing
to ease my poor heart §

47:14.285 --> 47:18.881
§ All the world would seem sad,
dear, without you §

47:18.956 --> 47:23.725
§ Tell me now that we never will part §

47:23.795 --> 47:28.562
§ I will pawn you
my gold watch and chain, love §

47:28.633 --> 47:33.265
§ I will pawn you
my gold wedding ring §

47:33.339 --> 47:35.569
§ I will pawn you this... §

47:35.641 --> 47:37.040
- Molly?
- What?

47:37.110 --> 47:38.269
Would you come here a moment?

47:39.378 --> 47:40.606
What is it, Guy?

47:42.215 --> 47:44.706
Um, I just want to...

47:44.784 --> 47:46.251
Oh...

47:46.319 --> 47:48.948
You are fat.

47:52.060 --> 47:57.520
Y- you might think about cutting down
on the, um, desserts and the beer.

47:57.598 --> 48:00.624
And also possibly sex with men.

48:00.701 --> 48:04.604
W- when did-
when did this take place?

48:04.672 --> 48:06.070
Who-who did this to you?

48:07.842 --> 48:12.007
Ahh, yes, Lefty, Dusty,
are-are you boys aware of this?

48:12.080 --> 48:15.539
O- our little girl's going
to be a-a single mom.

48:15.618 --> 48:17.552
- You poor thing.
- Thank you.

48:17.620 --> 48:20.054
I'll swear on a stack of Bibles
it wasn't me, darlin'.

48:20.123 --> 48:23.148
Oh, that's great
to know, Dusty. Thanks.

48:23.225 --> 48:25.217
§ Do not scorn her §

48:25.295 --> 48:29.390
§ With words fierce and bitter §

48:29.465 --> 48:34.836
§ Do not laugh
at her shame and downfall §

48:34.905 --> 48:35.998
You should sit.

48:36.073 --> 48:40.770
§ For a moment,
just stop and consider §

48:40.843 --> 48:41.936
Just ignore them.

48:42.012 --> 48:48.384
§ That a man
was the cause of it all §

48:48.451 --> 48:49.816
Dusty!

48:49.886 --> 48:51.411
Yo!

48:51.489 --> 48:52.581
That reminds me.

48:52.657 --> 48:55.148
About that obscene song
you sang last week.

48:55.226 --> 48:56.920
- Obscene? Uh-
- Yeah.

48:56.994 --> 48:59.588
"I'll give you my moonshine
if you show me your jugs"?

48:59.664 --> 49:01.689
No, not that one.

49:01.766 --> 49:03.997
"Lovin' you ain't easy,
but I hear your sister is"?

49:04.069 --> 49:06.402
No, no, no.
"Come ride my pony all night long.

49:06.472 --> 49:08.632
"Come ride him bareback,
I'll sing you a song. " That one.

49:08.707 --> 49:10.402
That's just a song
about ridin' a pony.

49:10.475 --> 49:12.376
Mmm.

49:12.444 --> 49:14.412
Oh, what-what the hell
did you think it was about?

49:14.480 --> 49:16.573
Let's go out with a little style, OK?

49:16.649 --> 49:17.740
What do you say?

49:17.816 --> 49:19.444
"Go out"?
What do you mean?

49:19.519 --> 49:20.611
Just what I said.

49:20.688 --> 49:22.678
"Go out?" You mean me?

49:22.755 --> 49:24.188
All of us.

49:24.257 --> 49:26.191
What the Sam Hill are you
talkin' about, mister?

49:26.259 --> 49:27.226
- Ohh. Hold on.
- Hey.

49:27.292 --> 49:29.352
Got some nice egg salad sandwiches
if you're hungry.

49:29.429 --> 49:30.454
No gunplay backstage.

49:30.531 --> 49:32.361
I'm hungry.
I'm always hungry.

49:32.432 --> 49:33.899
Did you know
that she's pregnant?

49:33.967 --> 49:36.630
§ And can't be returned §

49:36.704 --> 49:41.199
§ You have left me
and gone to another §

49:41.276 --> 49:45.939
§ All my hopes
and bridges are burned §

49:46.013 --> 49:50.849
§ But I will pawn you
my gold watch and chain, love §

49:50.919 --> 49:55.947
§ And I will pawn you
my gold wedding ring §

49:56.024 --> 50:00.758
§ I will pawn you
this heart in my bosom §

50:00.830 --> 50:14.876
§ Only say that you'll love me again §

50:14.945 --> 50:16.378
Hee hee.

50:18.614 --> 50:19.479
Thank you, Yolanda.

50:19.549 --> 50:21.312
What a beautiful, beautiful song.

50:21.385 --> 50:23.376
This portion of our show
is brought to you...

50:23.453 --> 50:25.115
by Powdermilk Biscuits...

50:25.189 --> 50:28.282
and also brought to you by duct tape.

50:28.358 --> 50:29.986
Duct tape.
Yes, duct tape.

50:30.061 --> 50:32.359
Duct tape.

50:32.430 --> 50:34.591
Useful thing around the household...

50:34.666 --> 50:37.726
almost anything that comes
up around the household.

50:37.802 --> 50:40.771
Sometimes you need to make repairs,
doors come loose...

50:40.839 --> 50:43.705
and windows,
all sorts of things can happen.

50:43.775 --> 50:47.906
Sometimes you just forget something
that you're looking for...

50:47.980 --> 50:49.776
and duct tape can come in handy.

50:49.847 --> 50:53.283
You can wrap it around your finger
like a string or something.

50:53.352 --> 50:54.842
You can just tape it up.
Whatever.

50:54.919 --> 50:56.409
Things do tend to fall apart, you know.

50:56.488 --> 51:00.651
Confusion reins endemic
in our world today.

51:00.725 --> 51:02.661
- Just things tend to drift-
- Oh, jeez.

51:02.729 --> 51:05.163
And especially as you get to be older...

51:05.231 --> 51:07.324
duct tape is
the most useful thing you'll find.

51:07.400 --> 51:09.926
All repairs are short term.
We know that.

51:10.004 --> 51:14.337
Say a faucet should be dripping
and you, and you...

51:15.107 --> 51:17.633
The water is falling there,
dripping onto your cupboard...

51:17.711 --> 51:20.806
and the-and the wood
comes loose from the wall...

51:20.881 --> 51:22.643
and you need something to fix it.

51:22.716 --> 51:25.311
Just reach for a roll of duct tape.

51:25.386 --> 51:27.616
That would be the-the perfect thing.

51:27.688 --> 51:30.781
Or maybe your orangutano's
been jumpin' up and down on it.

51:32.493 --> 51:34.893
The weight of the orangutan has,
like, you know, crushed-

51:34.963 --> 51:36.396
uh, crushed part of the counter.

51:36.464 --> 51:38.056
And-and then your Rottweiler...

51:38.133 --> 51:40.693
he comes runnin' out and
he bites the orangutan in the hinder.

51:40.769 --> 51:42.464
Gets him all riled up.

51:43.170 --> 51:44.138
Hey.

51:44.206 --> 51:46.697
The Rottweiler, actually,
is locked in the basement.

51:46.775 --> 51:47.742
Sorry to correct you there, Rhonda.

51:47.809 --> 51:48.867
I can hear them goin' at it.

51:48.944 --> 51:51.209
- He's down locked in the basement.
- The Rottweiler and the orangutan.

51:51.280 --> 51:52.373
A double lock there.

51:52.449 --> 51:53.938
Because the-
uh, the orangutan, you know...

51:54.016 --> 51:56.576
They got, uh, the fingers
and he's got a saw.

51:58.287 --> 51:59.878
A chainsaw.

52:01.123 --> 52:03.558
He cut a big hole in the door
and the Rottweiler got out.

52:03.626 --> 52:06.255
That's how he bit the orangutan
in the hinder.

52:08.431 --> 52:10.764
And then-and then
don't forget about the peacock.

52:12.802 --> 52:14.794
And then the flock.
Uh, overhead there was...

52:14.871 --> 52:16.772
a big helicopter
came flyin' through.

52:18.810 --> 52:20.868
Right through a flock
of Canadian geese.

52:22.614 --> 52:25.673
And, uh, really was gettin'
someone's goose was cooked.

52:25.749 --> 52:26.808
And then they startled the peacock.

52:28.620 --> 52:29.712
Yeah! Then-

52:29.788 --> 52:30.881
And then this-this sick-

52:30.956 --> 52:32.048
- The peacock.
- No, wait.

52:32.124 --> 52:35.991
This sadist-this sadist in uh, sneakers
was creepin' up on everybody.

52:36.061 --> 52:40.258
And the peacock, he-uh-
he jumps right at the orangutan.

52:40.331 --> 52:42.562
His beak...

52:42.635 --> 52:46.537
yeah... is flashing like a scimitar.

52:46.606 --> 52:50.770
Yeah, but the, uh, but his aim is-
uh, goes awry and it-and then, um-

52:50.844 --> 52:52.071
He takes that chainsaw and he throws it.

52:52.144 --> 52:54.544
The orangutan throws it
at the peacock.

52:54.613 --> 52:55.978
But he's got a bad aim.
The aim.

52:56.049 --> 52:58.609
It goes right through a plate-glass window.

52:58.685 --> 52:59.777
But it almost-

53:01.354 --> 53:02.844
Yeah-hits the mailman.

53:02.923 --> 53:04.015
Wow! Oh!

53:04.090 --> 53:07.617
Murray. But doesn't.
It misses him by inches.

53:07.694 --> 53:12.860
And by the way, he's bringin' you a letter
from your ex-girlfriend. Remember her?

53:12.934 --> 53:16.335
Who is still furious at you
for having dumped her.

53:16.404 --> 53:20.739
You know, just thrown her aside,
the woman who loved you.

53:20.809 --> 53:22.070
Just because
you found somebody new.

53:22.142 --> 53:23.804
How could you do that?

53:23.878 --> 53:27.575
She will never understand.
And, um...

53:27.648 --> 53:30.311
duct tape isn't gonna
help you with that one bit.

53:30.385 --> 53:31.579
No, I suppose not, but with two out of-

53:31.653 --> 53:33.848
And duct tape is not gonna make
an honest man out of you.

53:35.024 --> 53:38.755
No, it won't. But with two out of three
chores around the home, duct tape.

53:38.828 --> 53:40.659
And it isn't even gonna help you
find whatever it was...

53:40.730 --> 53:43.324
you were lookin' for, so-
what were you lookin' for?

53:43.399 --> 53:44.889
I was lookin' for duct tape.
Duct tape.

53:44.968 --> 53:46.902
All repairs are temporary and short term.

53:46.971 --> 53:48.096
It's almost just about the only thing...

53:48.171 --> 53:51.800
that really works sometimes,
and that is duct tape.

53:51.875 --> 53:54.241
<i>More of A Prairie Home Companion
here in just a moment...</i>

53:54.377 --> 53:57.779
right after we come in
with a word about coffee.

53:57.848 --> 54:01.580
Yes, Jearlyn,
nothing stimulates a person...

54:01.653 --> 54:06.589
keeps you focused quite
like good old caffeine.

54:06.657 --> 54:07.750
Black coffee.

54:07.826 --> 54:11.318
Mmm. So good.
I'm glad you like it, too.

54:13.297 --> 54:15.129
§ Smells so lovely when you pour it §

54:15.200 --> 54:18.499
§ You will want to drink a quart of coffee §

54:20.572 --> 54:22.130
§ It's delicious all alone §

54:22.207 --> 54:24.334
§ It's also good with doughnuts §

54:24.409 --> 54:25.900
§ Black coffee §

54:27.779 --> 54:29.715
§ Coffee stimulates your urges §

54:29.782 --> 54:31.306

it's awfully good coffee §

54:46.833 --> 54:49.563
Chuck?
I'm ready for you now.

54:51.639 --> 54:52.731
Chuck?

54:52.807 --> 54:54.603
§ Much too long §

54:54.675 --> 54:57.372
Hey, you decent? Chuck?

54:59.781 --> 55:01.510
Whoa!

55:01.583 --> 55:04.780
Chuck, what you got
goin' in here, huh?

55:04.852 --> 55:06.252
Huh!

55:06.321 --> 55:08.755
Candles and music and-

55:08.823 --> 55:12.157
Hey, hey, wake up, buddy.

55:12.227 --> 55:13.353
Hey-Chu-

55:14.431 --> 55:15.761
Chuck?

55:16.130 --> 55:19.589
§ Oh, my Lord does just what he said §

55:19.635 --> 55:23.628

56:00.044 --> 56:04.311

56:05.684 --> 56:07.652
Honey? It's me.

56:09.222 --> 56:12.589
Ready or not, here I come.

56:12.659 --> 56:18.826
I am lookin' for a big hot dog
to put in my bun, you old dog, you.

56:18.899 --> 56:21.958
Why you hidin' from me?

56:22.035 --> 56:24.503
Wake up.
Wake up, sugar.

56:31.210 --> 56:33.271
Oh!

56:33.348 --> 56:34.473
Chuck?

56:38.451 --> 56:40.683
Chuck! Chuck!

56:40.755 --> 56:43.723
It's OK.
It's OK. It's OK.

56:44.758 --> 56:47.125
But how can he be dead?

56:47.195 --> 56:48.891
He just went away, that's all.

56:48.964 --> 56:52.227
Oh, my Chuck.

56:52.300 --> 56:53.791
My baby.

56:53.868 --> 56:56.701
The death of an old man
is not a tragedy.

56:56.771 --> 56:58.636
Oh...

56:58.708 --> 57:00.801
I don't want him to go.

57:01.876 --> 57:06.711
Forgive him his shortcomings
and thank him for all of his love and care.

57:06.782 --> 57:09.411

57:53.866 --> 57:54.958
Thank you so much.

57:55.033 --> 57:57.228
Time to break now
for station identification.

57:57.302 --> 58:00.431
And we'll right back
with more right after this.

58:10.251 --> 58:13.482
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now
at nine minutes to broadcast, please.

58:13.554 --> 58:14.645
Nine minutes.

58:15.890 --> 58:18.017
Hey. No smokin', mister.

58:19.727 --> 58:23.025
Chuck Akers is dead.
He's gone.

58:24.132 --> 58:28.091
I don't follow your reasoning there.

58:28.170 --> 58:30.365
I said Chuck is dead.

58:32.040 --> 58:33.371
Who's dead?

58:33.440 --> 58:34.737
Chuck.

58:36.677 --> 58:37.804
When?

58:37.880 --> 58:39.574
Now.

58:39.648 --> 58:41.275
He just died now?

58:41.349 --> 58:42.839
I don't know when the hell he died.

58:42.918 --> 58:45.409
I wasn't there.

58:45.488 --> 58:47.513
What was the approximate
time of death?

58:47.590 --> 58:50.184
Recent. Why don't you go
check it out for yourself.

58:50.259 --> 58:51.556
He's in there.

58:52.961 --> 58:55.624
Does anyone else know about this?

58:55.698 --> 58:57.529
I have no idea.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.625
Because if anyone else knows about this
and they're not saying anything...

58:59.703 --> 59:00.862
I need to know about that.

59:08.478 --> 59:09.605
Excuse me.

59:17.655 --> 59:19.282
I used to listen to your show...

59:21.158 --> 59:22.786
until I died.

59:25.163 --> 59:27.130
My name was Lois Peterson.

59:30.301 --> 59:32.167
I was driving up to this cabin up north...

59:32.238 --> 59:35.901
and you were telling a story
and I was laughing.

59:37.542 --> 59:41.410
And then the car skidded off the road
and into a ditch and it flipped.

59:41.479 --> 59:44.575
And as it did, the thought occurred to me...

59:44.651 --> 59:48.747
that the story just wasn't that funny.

59:51.691 --> 59:53.658
And then...

59:53.726 --> 01:00:00.860
I was standing in this tall grass
looking down at my own body.

01:00:00.935 --> 01:00:02.026
Hmm.

01:00:02.102 --> 01:00:03.899
So sorry.

01:00:05.872 --> 01:00:09.365
I was on my way to that cabin
to meet my lover Larry.

01:00:09.443 --> 01:00:14.346
We had been planning it
for over two months.

01:00:15.449 --> 01:00:22.083
And because of your story,
I lost control and I died.

01:00:22.157 --> 01:00:24.283
- So...
- I'm so sorry.

01:00:24.358 --> 01:00:27.022
So you killed me, in a way.

01:00:27.096 --> 01:00:28.527
Isn't that interesting?

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:32.895
He's quite dead.

01:00:32.969 --> 01:00:34.401
Just a half an hour ago
he was walkin' around...

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:37.405
exchangin' the gases
with the atmosphere.

01:00:37.473 --> 01:00:39.339
Well, there's a lot more
out than in now.

01:00:39.409 --> 01:00:40.774
We should call the cops.

01:00:40.843 --> 01:00:41.934
No.

01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:44.741
When the time is right,
I'll make the call.

01:00:44.814 --> 01:00:45.905
You... just, um-

01:00:45.981 --> 01:00:48.679
All right. We're at five minutes
from broadcast.

01:00:48.752 --> 01:00:50.185
Don't talk about this to anyone.
All right?

01:00:50.254 --> 01:00:52.050
Keep it under your hat.

01:00:52.121 --> 01:00:53.214
Go about your business.

01:00:57.594 --> 01:00:59.186
I'm gonna secure the area.

01:00:59.263 --> 01:01:01.458
Let's get on with the show.

01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:03.727
You gonna be all right?

01:01:03.801 --> 01:01:05.098
Yeah, I'll be all right.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.973
So you're really an angel?

01:01:11.041 --> 01:01:12.475
Of course.

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:14.136
Hmm.

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:15.680
What do you do?

01:01:15.747 --> 01:01:16.840
Well, that's a dumb question.

01:01:16.916 --> 01:01:18.974
No, no. I-uh, I do lots of things.

01:01:19.051 --> 01:01:23.579
I comfort people that are desperately sad.

01:01:23.656 --> 01:01:26.056
And I make personal appearances.

01:01:26.126 --> 01:01:28.354
I-

01:01:28.426 --> 01:01:30.987
Tears on a statue.

01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:35.467
One time I put the face of the Lord
on a bowl of oatmeal.

01:01:35.535 --> 01:01:36.729
Just to cheer people up.

01:01:36.803 --> 01:01:39.533
You know, those kind of things.

01:01:39.607 --> 01:01:42.905
But mostly I-I take people up to see God.

01:01:42.976 --> 01:01:44.500
That's why I'm here.

01:01:44.577 --> 01:01:49.243
But I-I just keep thinking
about that story...

01:01:49.317 --> 01:01:53.082
and why it was funny.

01:01:53.154 --> 01:01:55.145
The story I told on the radio?

01:01:55.223 --> 01:01:56.985
It was about penguins.

01:01:57.057 --> 01:01:58.855
Oh. The penguin joke.

01:02:00.995 --> 01:02:03.155
Two penguins standing on an ice floe.

01:02:03.231 --> 01:02:04.323
That's the one.

01:02:04.399 --> 01:02:06.528
And the first penguin says...

01:02:06.603 --> 01:02:08.866
"You look like
you're wearing a tuxedo. "

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.866
And the second penguin says...

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.567
"What makes you think I'm not?"

01:02:17.146 --> 01:02:18.739
- Is there more?
- No.

01:02:18.814 --> 01:02:20.111
- That's the joke?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:20.183 --> 01:02:21.410
Why is that funny?

01:02:22.652 --> 01:02:24.983
I guess it's funny
because people laugh at it.

01:02:25.055 --> 01:02:28.456
I'm not laughing.

01:02:28.525 --> 01:02:33.792
You're an angel.

01:02:33.863 --> 01:02:36.388
G.K. to the stage, please.
G.K. to the stage, please.

01:02:36.467 --> 01:02:37.558
I should probably go.

01:02:37.635 --> 01:02:40.433
Oh yes, of course.
I didn't come for you.

01:02:40.504 --> 01:02:43.564
Oh. OK. All right.

01:02:43.641 --> 01:02:44.734
I think they're waiting for me.

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:48.541
Oh-what did the second penguin say?

01:02:48.613 --> 01:02:54.050
The second penguin said,
"What makes you think I'm not?" OK?

01:02:54.119 --> 01:02:55.916
- OK.
- All right. See you.

01:02:57.389 --> 01:02:59.016
Take your time.

01:02:59.092 --> 01:03:01.217
Thanks.

01:03:01.292 --> 01:03:05.559
Two minutes from broadcast.
Two minutes, please.

01:03:05.631 --> 01:03:07.655
Ahem. Ahem. Ahem.

01:03:07.732 --> 01:03:08.825
Could I have a word with you?

01:03:10.135 --> 01:03:14.469
Uh, we have a situation here,
um, which we are monitoring...

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.974
but I wanted you to be apprised of it.

01:03:18.544 --> 01:03:20.375
You mean the woman
in the white trench coat?

01:03:20.446 --> 01:03:22.107
No, there's a woman in a w-

01:03:22.182 --> 01:03:24.240
a white trench coat, yes.
You saw her?

01:03:24.317 --> 01:03:26.251
- I saw her over here.
- You spoke to her?

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.877
You-no, you were talking to her.

01:03:27.954 --> 01:03:29.047
You saw that?

01:03:29.123 --> 01:03:30.590
Yeah. You.

01:03:30.657 --> 01:03:33.718
Well, if you see her in the audience,
I need you to give me a high sign.

01:03:33.795 --> 01:03:35.728
Just use-give me a signal
with your hand.

01:03:35.796 --> 01:03:38.026
Do, uh...

01:03:38.098 --> 01:03:39.191
No. Here, do it behind your back.

01:03:39.267 --> 01:03:41.632
- Just-just-just wiggle.
- Rabbit tail?

01:03:41.702 --> 01:03:45.434
Yeah, and give me a verbal, uh, sign,
some-something in code.

01:03:45.507 --> 01:03:46.997
Just say, uh, indemnity.

01:03:47.075 --> 01:03:48.337
- Indemnity. Yeah.
- OK.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:50.434
Or no. Granite Falls.

01:03:50.512 --> 01:03:52.412
OK. How does that-

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.845
How does that go?
Granite Falls?

01:03:53.915 --> 01:03:55.906
Well, you just say, uh,
then we would like to do a song now...

01:03:55.984 --> 01:03:58.452
for our dear friends in...

01:03:58.521 --> 01:03:59.613
Granite Falls.

01:03:59.688 --> 01:04:00.916
OK. All right. OK.

01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:04.927
And then if I miss that,
uh, this'll be a cue for Rich...

01:04:04.994 --> 01:04:07.395
to do a-a musical turn.

01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:13.064
- That's the code.
- Code?

01:04:13.136 --> 01:04:15.035
Then I'll get it. OK?

01:04:15.105 --> 01:04:17.267
That's how I got into radio, actually.

01:04:17.341 --> 01:04:18.307
Morse code.

01:04:18.375 --> 01:04:21.208
I was a deckhand on a-on a boat.

01:04:21.278 --> 01:04:22.939
Big storm. November.

01:04:23.013 --> 01:04:24.378
I'll never forget it.

01:04:24.447 --> 01:04:25.608
You got on the ship radio...

01:04:25.683 --> 01:04:28.151
and you told jokes
and you sang for two hours...

01:04:28.219 --> 01:04:29.243
until the ship came in safely to port.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.585
Right.
I told you that story?

01:04:31.657 --> 01:04:32.622
Granite Falls.

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:33.816
- G.K.?
- Granite Falls. Right.

01:04:33.892 --> 01:04:34.949
Yeah?

01:04:35.026 --> 01:04:37.757
- If you see G.K. do that behind his back...
- Fifteen seconds.

01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:38.796
it's your cue to go like this.

01:04:40.998 --> 01:04:42.966
So what are you gonna do
for work after this?

01:04:43.035 --> 01:04:44.558
I don't know.
I'll find a job somewhere.

01:04:45.704 --> 01:04:47.069
Like where?

01:04:47.139 --> 01:04:50.472
A job where I never have to say a word.

01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:51.736
Why?

01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:53.971
That's why. Right there.

01:04:54.046 --> 01:04:55.013
What are you gonna do?

01:04:55.079 --> 01:04:56.638
Like be an underwear model
or something?

01:04:56.716 --> 01:04:57.876
If they ask, sure.

01:04:57.951 --> 01:04:59.885
- You're on.
- Yes.

I feel like an anthropologist...

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:33.300
finding some primitive tribe
squatting around a fire in the forest...

01:09:33.376 --> 01:09:35.709
telling stories,
sparks flying up in the air.

01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:37.008

Oh, that's the guy, uh,
used to come see the shows here.

01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:53.962
Um, local boy.
He's a writer.

01:09:54.032 --> 01:09:56.000
Uh, he wrote novels.

01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:57.227
Uh, F. Scott Fitzgerald.

01:09:57.301 --> 01:09:58.600
Grew up right here in St. Paul.

01:09:58.671 --> 01:09:59.695
What kind of novels?

01:10:00.739 --> 01:10:02.264
Uh, romantic ones.

01:10:02.341 --> 01:10:03.308
- Oh.
- Mostly.

01:10:03.376 --> 01:10:04.934
I don't read romances. No time.

01:10:05.012 --> 01:10:07.706
Hmm. We usually have,
uh, clients in here.

01:10:07.779 --> 01:10:09.645
You know, five or six of them
at a time, sponsors-

01:10:09.715 --> 01:10:11.979
That's some nice plaster work
around the proscenium there.

01:10:12.051 --> 01:10:13.484
We'll have to remember
to save a piece of that.

01:10:13.553 --> 01:10:15.214
I wish we were taping this show.

01:10:15.289 --> 01:10:17.189
This is a live show.

01:10:17.257 --> 01:10:19.191
Videotape.
Historical purposes.

01:10:19.259 --> 01:10:20.817
Send it to a museum.

01:10:20.893 --> 01:10:22.327
Well, this is just great.
This is all I need.

01:10:22.396 --> 01:10:24.488
This is the first time
somebody died at the show.

01:10:24.565 --> 01:10:26.658
- I mean, the first time!
- Al, we're all gettin' older.

01:10:26.734 --> 01:10:27.700
He's dead?!

01:10:27.768 --> 01:10:29.100
The show's not over, is it?

01:10:29.169 --> 01:10:31.229
We've got a dead man downstairs.

01:10:31.306 --> 01:10:32.398
We've gotta do something.

01:10:32.473 --> 01:10:34.166
Just be glad-glad you
don't have him onstage.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.176
- When did this happen?
- Who's that, Chuck?

01:10:36.244 --> 01:10:37.575
- Yes.
- Where's Evelyn?

01:10:37.646 --> 01:10:38.669
Evelyn was down there.

01:10:38.746 --> 01:10:41.112
He was waitin' for Evelyn
when he passed away.

01:10:41.182 --> 01:10:43.480
He died with a heart full of hope.

01:10:43.552 --> 01:10:46.146
Yeah, that's not a bad way to go
when you think about it.

01:10:46.221 --> 01:10:48.814
Sittin' there in the dark,
in your underwear, you know?

01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:50.290
Waitin' for your lover to come.

01:10:50.358 --> 01:10:51.916
He was in his underwear?

01:10:51.994 --> 01:10:55.362
Donna told me he was wearin'
boxer shorts with big raspberries on 'em...

01:10:55.432 --> 01:10:58.695
and a great big bottle of massage oil
and a bayberry candle goin'...

01:10:58.767 --> 01:11:00.826
<i>and Mills Brothers' Greatest Hits.</i>

01:11:00.903 --> 01:11:03.565
He was all set.
He was loaded for Evelyn.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.870
Well, uh, can I offer you
somethin' to drink?

01:11:05.941 --> 01:11:07.409
Water. No ice. No lemon.

01:11:09.679 --> 01:11:11.374
Water. No ice. No lemon.

01:11:11.448 --> 01:11:12.881

01:11:14.451 --> 01:11:17.978
Radio sound effects
learned from a master.

01:11:18.053 --> 01:11:19.454
What can I tell you about the show?

01:11:19.523 --> 01:11:21.388
I know everything I need
to know about the show.

01:11:22.526 --> 01:11:24.459
- You're sure about that?
- Yes.

01:11:24.528 --> 01:11:25.859
You're not gonna change your mind?

01:11:25.930 --> 01:11:27.295
Ahh! No.

01:11:27.365 --> 01:11:28.491
Hmm.

01:11:31.602 --> 01:11:32.569

but, uh, these folks
put their lives into this.

01:11:37.876 --> 01:11:39.969
Now they can put their lives
into something else.

01:11:40.045 --> 01:11:41.774
There's always something
to put your life into, isn't there?

01:11:41.847 --> 01:11:43.245
It's like the Scripture tells us...

01:11:43.314 --> 01:11:45.250
you have to lose your life
before you can...

01:11:45.317 --> 01:11:46.443
find it.

01:11:47.486 --> 01:11:49.750
Scripture is guiding you here?

01:11:49.821 --> 01:11:52.154
The company is owned
by people of faith, Mr. Noir.

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.721
Ahh. Before I came to the Lord,
I played in a band myself.

01:11:57.796 --> 01:11:59.765
The Dukes of Rhythm.
Ha ha.

01:11:59.833 --> 01:12:01.697
We were terrible.

01:12:01.768 --> 01:12:05.033
Then, thank God, we were saved by
the simple realization of the truth.

01:12:05.171 --> 01:12:06.763
We were no good.
We got fired.

01:12:06.839 --> 01:12:08.636
It was a blessing.

01:12:08.708 --> 01:12:09.677
You wanna say something?

01:12:09.743 --> 01:12:11.209
Say what?
No, I don't want to say-

01:12:11.277 --> 01:12:12.246
You know, you should say somethin'...

01:12:12.312 --> 01:12:14.338
'cause he was on the show
all these years.

01:12:14.416 --> 01:12:15.383
Absolutely.

01:12:15.449 --> 01:12:17.383
I don't do eulogies. I don't.

01:12:17.451 --> 01:12:19.612
Is there a reason for that?
Or you just don't care for people?

01:12:19.687 --> 01:12:21.279
I'm at an age where
if I started to do them...

01:12:21.355 --> 01:12:23.084
I'd do nothing but eulogies.

01:12:23.157 --> 01:12:24.784
How about just
a moment of silence?

01:12:24.858 --> 01:12:27.349
Silence on the radio?
I don't know how that works.

01:12:27.429 --> 01:12:28.794
Garrison, OK, thank you.

01:12:28.862 --> 01:12:30.161
OK, we've got about thirty seconds.
Thirty seconds.

01:12:30.232 --> 01:12:31.960
Hold on a second.
You're saying if my mom died...

01:12:32.033 --> 01:12:33.968
you wouldn't do anything,
you wouldn't say anything.

01:12:34.036 --> 01:12:35.002
If I what?

01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:37.665
You'd just ignore it,
you'd act like it never happened?

01:12:37.739 --> 01:12:38.707
How could you do that?

01:12:38.775 --> 01:12:40.002
We don't look back in radio.

01:12:40.076 --> 01:12:41.270
That's the beauty of it.

01:12:41.342 --> 01:12:43.038
Nobody gets old.
Nobody dies.

01:12:43.112 --> 01:12:44.740
We just keep on goin'.

01:12:44.815 --> 01:12:45.781
What if you died?

01:12:45.848 --> 01:12:47.213
I will.

01:12:47.283 --> 01:12:48.648
You don't want people
to remember you?

01:12:48.719 --> 01:12:51.516
I don't want them to be told
to remember me.

01:12:51.587 --> 01:12:53.646
Hmm?

01:12:53.723 --> 01:12:55.749
You know what?
Somebody died down there.

01:12:55.826 --> 01:12:56.816
That's right.

01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:58.190
OK? And we're not
even paying attention...

01:12:58.261 --> 01:12:59.659
and you're not even
gonna say anything?

01:12:59.729 --> 01:13:01.196
We pay attention by doin' our job.

01:13:01.263 --> 01:13:03.789
Go, go, go.
You're on, you're on, you're on.

01:13:03.867 --> 01:13:05.731
I gotta get someone
to take me home.

01:13:05.802 --> 01:13:07.633
I'm not spendin' the night
alone tonight.

01:13:07.704 --> 01:13:09.797
Don't-nobody even cares.

01:13:09.873 --> 01:13:11.670
No, we do.
We all care.

01:13:11.742 --> 01:13:13.142
We care like hell.

01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:14.178
You're gonna want to have...

01:13:14.245 --> 01:13:16.679
a whole freezer full
of Prince of Pizzas.

01:13:16.748 --> 01:13:20.343
It's the frozen pizza that
tastes homemade always.

01:13:20.418 --> 01:13:24.412
Made from real Minnesota
cheese and sausage.

it's like a zoo.

01:13:42.909 --> 01:13:46.207

01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:10.861
Yeah?

01:14:10.939 --> 01:14:13.908
Molly, listen, I need you to do something
for me. It's very important.

01:14:13.974 --> 01:14:14.942
What?

01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:17.308
I need you come out here

- I'm right here.

01:14:22.217 --> 01:14:24.651
- Who's this?
- I don't know.

01:14:24.719 --> 01:14:27.017
No, who-
who's talking to me?

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:28.077

01:14:35.866 --> 01:14:37.595
OK.

01:14:37.667 --> 01:14:40.101
I have to ask you
to do something for me.

01:14:40.169 --> 01:14:41.137
It's very important.

01:14:41.205 --> 01:14:42.694
- It's, uh...
- What?

01:14:43.841 --> 01:14:45.833
I need a drink.

01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:47.376
Uhh!

Oh, je-

01:14:50.481 --> 01:14:51.641

01:14:54.218 --> 01:14:55.185
Yeah.

01:14:55.252 --> 01:14:59.155
So how's it goin' in there
with, uh, axeman?

01:15:00.192 --> 01:15:01.351
Very slippery.

01:15:01.426 --> 01:15:02.757
How do they keep
the drinks on there?

01:15:02.827 --> 01:15:03.852
It's going very well.

01:15:03.929 --> 01:15:05.953
I mean, well, he's tough.
He's tough.

01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:10.991
But, uh, I think, uh,
I think I have another solution.

01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:12.037
What?

01:15:12.104 --> 01:15:13.731
Well, he used to be in a band.

01:15:13.806 --> 01:15:15.797
A long time ago
called the Dukes of Rhythm...

01:15:15.875 --> 01:15:18.275
and I think if we can round up
the guys who were in that band...

01:15:18.344 --> 01:15:20.335
and get 'em all on the show...

01:15:20.412 --> 01:15:21.971
Sorry.

01:15:22.048 --> 01:15:26.815
Um, we can, um, we can maybe
get him to change his mind.

01:15:26.887 --> 01:15:32.087
Have a kind of reunion, you know,
with all the, uh, band members...

01:15:32.158 --> 01:15:33.182
<i>right here on
The Prairie Home Companion.</i>

01:15:56.951 --> 01:15:57.976

01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.520

01:17:02.755 --> 01:17:05.986
and that was... music.
You know?

01:17:06.058 --> 01:17:07.286

01:29:27.714 --> 01:29:31.150
§ And that's the end of my song §

01:29:31.218 --> 01:29:34.585
§ She put a hose in his tailpipe §

01:29:34.655 --> 01:29:36.919
§ 'Cause he had done her wrong §

01:29:36.991 --> 01:29:39.983
§ He was her man §

01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:46.260
§ And that's all she wrote §

01:29:47.334 --> 01:29:48.825
Thank you.

01:29:48.970 --> 01:29:51.700
Ha ha ha!

01:29:51.773 --> 01:29:54.241
There's a young woman
who's going a long way.

01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:55.936
We're going, too.
We're out of here,

01:29:56.011 --> 01:29:57.308
And that's our show.

01:29:57.679 --> 01:29:59.509
Remember to keep
your feet on the ground...

01:29:59.581 --> 01:30:01.172
your hopes up high...

01:30:01.249 --> 01:30:03.547
pray for rain,
keep the humor dry...

01:30:03.619 --> 01:30:06.110
and eat those Powdermilk Biscuits.

01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:07.986
Thank you, everybody.

01:30:08.057 --> 01:30:15.964
§ Come and sit by my side
if you love me §

01:30:16.033 --> 01:30:23.666
§ Do not hasten to bid me adieu §

01:30:23.739 --> 01:30:31.705
§ But remember the Red River Valley §

01:30:31.783 --> 01:30:40.054
§ And the one
who has loved you so true §

01:30:40.124 --> 01:30:41.250
Show's almost over.

01:30:41.326 --> 01:30:42.726
In more ways than one.

01:30:42.794 --> 01:30:45.389
Nice perfume.
Who are you with? The show?

01:30:45.463 --> 01:30:46.953
In a way.

01:30:47.031 --> 01:30:49.364
I used to listen
to this show every week.

01:30:49.435 --> 01:30:54.269
Hmm. Well, it was great in its time,
but the time's up. Life moves on.

01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:55.830
It does.

01:30:55.908 --> 01:30:57.704
So, be careful driving tonight.

01:30:57.775 --> 01:30:59.835
Need a lift somewhere?

01:30:59.913 --> 01:31:02.574
There's a shortcut to the airport.

01:31:02.648 --> 01:31:07.552
A steep hill followed by a series
of sharp curves and a large oak tree.

01:31:07.621 --> 01:31:09.453
What's your name?

01:31:09.523 --> 01:31:10.489
Asphodel.

01:31:10.557 --> 01:31:12.354
Pretty.
I like your hair that way.

01:31:12.425 --> 01:31:15.417
§ Come and sit by my side... §

01:31:15.496 --> 01:31:16.690
When I used to listen to them...

01:31:16.764 --> 01:31:19.028
it was like they were all
my really good friends.

01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:20.794
But something else happened, right?

01:31:20.867 --> 01:31:21.835
Right.

01:31:21.901 --> 01:31:23.962
Well...

01:31:24.038 --> 01:31:28.668
I'm that something else.

01:31:28.743 --> 01:31:36.650
§ But remember
the Red River Valley §

01:31:46.895 --> 01:31:48.328
How long is the ride to the airport?

01:31:48.398 --> 01:31:49.365
Twenty minutes.

01:31:49.432 --> 01:31:52.366
She said there was a shortcut.

01:31:52.435 --> 01:31:53.732
Yes, sir. I know it.

01:32:27.438 --> 01:32:30.204
That was the last we saw of him.

01:32:30.276 --> 01:32:32.334
The car hit a tree and blew up.

01:32:34.579 --> 01:32:37.777
Good-bye, axeman.

01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:42.310
But it didn't change a thing.

01:32:42.388 --> 01:32:43.821
<i>They sang Sweet By and By...</i>

01:32:43.890 --> 01:32:50.489
and the audience filed out
and everybody packed up and left.

01:32:50.564 --> 01:32:51.552
First thing in the morning...

01:32:51.630 --> 01:32:53.962
a truck from the demolition
company pulls up...

01:32:54.034 --> 01:32:59.199
and two guys started drilling
for the explosives.

01:32:59.272 --> 01:33:03.174
Just like ya learned
in eighth grade English.

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:08.204
§ So gather ye rosebuds while ye may §

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:14.119
§ Oh, time is still a-flying §

01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:20.525
§ This same flower that smiles today §

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:24.532
§ Tomorrow §

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.567
§ Will be dying §

01:33:40.049 --> 01:33:41.847
Come on, pal.

01:33:41.918 --> 01:33:43.476
Let me buy you a drink.

01:33:48.725 --> 01:33:49.851
Ah!

01:34:06.944 --> 01:34:09.037
Donna, make it three eggs over.

01:34:09.113 --> 01:34:11.049
- No, listen to her.
- I was tellin' you.

01:34:11.116 --> 01:34:12.139
What were you saying?

01:34:12.216 --> 01:34:14.584
We are talkin'
about doin' a farewell tour.

01:34:14.653 --> 01:34:15.847
- Yeah.
- Oh, who?

01:34:15.921 --> 01:34:17.945
Oh, the whole gang
from the old radio show.

01:34:18.023 --> 01:34:19.957
- Yeah.
- But the show's been over for years.

01:34:20.025 --> 01:34:20.993
Yeah, I mean-

01:34:21.059 --> 01:34:22.755
So? I always wanted to do
a farewell tour.

01:34:22.829 --> 01:34:24.194
I loved doin' that last show.

01:34:24.262 --> 01:34:27.494
I just want to do one last show
and then another one...

01:34:27.567 --> 01:34:29.365
until I'm in a wheelchair.

01:34:29.436 --> 01:34:31.369
I just want to keep doin' them.

01:34:31.438 --> 01:34:33.302
You know, as long as I can
remember the words.

01:34:33.372 --> 01:34:35.204
There's all sorts of towns
we haven't played.

01:34:35.275 --> 01:34:38.539
I mean, you've got Gooseberry Falls
and Lake Winnebigoshish.

01:34:38.611 --> 01:34:41.582
Up in Lake Winnebigoshish
a lot of people are waitin' to see us.

01:34:41.649 --> 01:34:42.740
Well, you-don't count on me.

01:34:42.816 --> 01:34:43.976
I got a lot of stuff happening.

01:34:44.051 --> 01:34:45.212
What?

01:34:45.286 --> 01:34:47.481
Oh, things.
Things that are in the works.

01:34:47.555 --> 01:34:50.351
Different deals I'm... working out.

01:34:50.423 --> 01:34:52.289
I'll be in and out of town a lot.

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:55.261
- Yeah, OK. So, what about you?
- Hey, I'm free.

01:34:55.330 --> 01:34:56.296
- Oh!
- Great!

01:34:56.363 --> 01:34:58.297
- Workin' at the parking ramp.
- The parkin' ramp?

01:34:58.366 --> 01:35:00.299
Yes. It's a good job.
I like it.

01:35:00.367 --> 01:35:01.357
I read a lot of books.

01:35:01.436 --> 01:35:02.403
Make that four eggs.

01:35:02.469 --> 01:35:03.938
Oh, boy.
You're readin' a lot.

01:35:04.005 --> 01:35:06.530
- Yeah.
- That's interesting.

01:35:06.674 --> 01:35:08.505
Oh, look at this!
Look who's here!

01:35:08.576 --> 01:35:09.976
Oh, my God, I miss these guys.

01:35:10.045 --> 01:35:11.911
Ha ha ha!

01:35:11.981 --> 01:35:15.041
Look who just blew in
from the old prairie.

01:35:15.117 --> 01:35:18.712
I thought you left town
ahead of the sheriff?

01:35:18.787 --> 01:35:21.518
Well, the woman decided
not to press charges.

01:35:21.591 --> 01:35:23.856
Oh, yeah?
What was the crime? Snorin'?

01:35:23.928 --> 01:35:26.259
Ha ha ha!

01:35:26.329 --> 01:35:27.990
Love.

01:35:28.064 --> 01:35:29.554
We just got back in town...

01:35:29.634 --> 01:35:31.361
from playin' the casinos
in South Dakota.

01:35:31.433 --> 01:35:32.923
Yeah? Playin' what? Pinochle?

01:35:33.003 --> 01:35:34.027
Ha ha ha!

01:35:34.104 --> 01:35:35.503
Playin' our music.

01:35:35.572 --> 01:35:37.699
Hey, we hear you might be
gettin' a tour up.

01:35:37.774 --> 01:35:38.797
Oh, yeah.

01:35:38.875 --> 01:35:41.036
We've added some rope tricks
to the repertoire.

01:35:41.111 --> 01:35:43.103
Flaming lariats.

01:35:43.181 --> 01:35:44.772
It's called "Rings of Fire. "

01:35:44.849 --> 01:35:46.942
Well, you know,
we got a bus with bunk beds...

01:35:47.019 --> 01:35:49.749
and we're goin' back
to playin' churches and schools.

01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:50.786
Look at this.

01:35:50.855 --> 01:35:54.257
She's only been workin' six months
and she's now the manager.

01:35:55.059 --> 01:35:56.027
What does she do?

01:35:56.094 --> 01:35:57.721
Um, I have no idea.

01:35:57.797 --> 01:36:00.163
- Somethin' religious?
- Software.

01:36:00.232 --> 01:36:02.757
Oh, it's big.
It's movin' like monkeys.

01:36:02.833 --> 01:36:04.392
Hi.

01:36:04.469 --> 01:36:06.936
All right, so, I looked
at your pension stuff.

01:36:07.005 --> 01:36:08.234
Oh, good.

01:36:08.308 --> 01:36:10.674
It's a horror show.

01:36:10.743 --> 01:36:13.507
Have you ever heard of mutual funds?

01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:15.810
You know, Mom, honestly,
you would have done a lot better...

01:36:15.882 --> 01:36:19.511
if you'd just stuck it in a shoe box
and put it under your bed.

01:36:19.586 --> 01:36:22.555
Well, that's why I
wanted you to help me.

01:36:22.623 --> 01:36:24.613
So-here.
Sign there.

01:36:24.692 --> 01:36:25.681
What is this?

01:36:25.759 --> 01:36:27.522
I have to get your assets
working again.

01:36:27.595 --> 01:36:29.620
- My what?
- Your assets.

01:36:29.696 --> 01:36:33.428
Oh. Oh! Power of attorney.

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.695
Oh! And you spent $6,000 on a bus?

01:36:35.769 --> 01:36:36.737
Yeah.

01:36:36.804 --> 01:36:38.135
Why didn't you ask me first?

01:36:38.205 --> 01:36:40.197
Well, I'm sorry.

01:36:40.275 --> 01:36:42.744
So...

01:36:42.811 --> 01:36:44.745
Can I keep the bus or?

01:36:47.782 --> 01:36:49.773
We'll talk about it later.

01:36:49.851 --> 01:36:51.785
- Hey-
- That sounds like a no.

01:36:51.853 --> 01:36:52.912
I love you, too.

01:36:52.989 --> 01:36:54.422
Bye, guys.

01:36:54.490 --> 01:36:56.320
Donna?

01:36:56.392 --> 01:36:57.585
- Bye!
- Oh, hey. Bye.

01:36:57.659 --> 01:36:58.786
So long.

01:36:58.861 --> 01:36:59.884
I thought that was
a terrific eulogy you gave...

01:36:59.961 --> 01:37:01.827
for old man Soderberg
at his memorial service.

01:37:01.896 --> 01:37:02.864
Thank you.

01:37:02.932 --> 01:37:04.991
Too bad the old coot
couldn't have been there to hear it.

01:37:05.068 --> 01:37:08.503
Yeah, and to have missed it
by just a few days.

01:37:08.571 --> 01:37:10.506
Hmm. Ha ha!

01:37:10.574 --> 01:37:11.870
Ha ha!

01:37:15.544 --> 01:37:16.841
Ha ha ha!

01:37:25.023 --> 01:37:26.512
I still love your laugh.

01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:27.613
Oh, yeah.

01:37:27.690 --> 01:37:30.319
- Hee hee hee!
- I got it.

01:37:30.394 --> 01:37:32.795
I get bored.

01:37:32.864 --> 01:37:33.955
Uh-huh.

01:37:34.031 --> 01:37:36.192
Ha ha ha!

01:37:36.266 --> 01:37:38.064
Thank you.

01:37:38.136 --> 01:37:40.070
That joke just gets better and better.

01:37:40.138 --> 01:37:42.265
- You know?
- Yep.

01:37:45.977 --> 01:37:47.536
Anybody want to change their order?

01:37:50.048 --> 01:37:51.778
Can I get a coffee?

01:37:51.849 --> 01:37:55.650
Ha ha ha!

01:37:55.722 --> 01:37:58.820
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!
