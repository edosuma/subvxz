THE AXE WAS THE GROUNDSKEEPER,

04:08.316 --> 04:11.018
AND THE BLOOD WAS JELLY...

04:11.084 --> 04:12.686
FROM A DONUT.

THEN SHE GOES AND JUDGES
SOME GUY AS AN AXE MANIAC

04:19.360 --> 04:21.562

06:04.598 --> 06:05.799
OKAY.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.102
SO KENDALL IS THE BAD BOY.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.839
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO START
WEARING BLACK CLOTHING

06:11.905 --> 06:16.477
AND TALKING DEEPER AND SLOWER.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.578

I CAN'T.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.515
BESIDES, I'M TERRIBLE AT FAKING.

06:21.582 --> 06:25.252

06:25.318 --> 06:26.620
I CAN ALWAYS TELL
WHEN SHE LIES TO ME.

YOUR BAND?

06:38.298 --> 06:40.233
THIS IS MY BAND.

ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU'RE
GONNA IGNORE ME AND GRIFFIN

06:43.771 --> 06:46.840

- BAD BOY.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.113
GET GRIFFIN OVER HERE.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.915
- WHY ISN'T HIS BACK TURNED
TO THE REST OF THEM?

06:56.049 --> 06:59.252
- BECAUSE HE WON'T DO AS I SAY!

06:59.319 --> 07:01.288
WHICH MAKES HIM THE BAD BOY.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.491
- AND I DON'T TURN MY BACK
ON MY FRIENDS.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.026
- THAT'S GOOD.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.394
I RESPECT THAT.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.029
BUT I SAID I WANTED BAD.

WANT THAT?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.602
- [screaming]

07:18.506 --> 07:19.740

07:19.807 --> 07:22.242
PARENTS WOULD NEVER LET
THEIR DAUGHTERS DATE,

07:22.309 --> 07:24.545
AND I WOULD LET MY DAUGHTER DATE
ANY ONE OF THESE BOYS,

07:24.612 --> 07:25.979
WHICH IS BAD.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.783
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS,
OR I WILL.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.119
WAIT.
I ALREADY DID.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.655
SAY HELLO TO WAYNEWAYNE.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.301
ISN'T HE BAD?

07:48.368 --> 07:49.537

08:09.022 --> 08:11.124
LOOK, I AIN'T HERE
TO MAKE FRIENDS, OKAY?

08:11.191 --> 08:15.095
I'M HERE TO TAKE BIG TIME RUSH
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.965
THE WAYNEWAYNE EXPRESS
IS LEAVING THE STATION.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.233
SO YOU FOOLS STEP ON...

08:20.300 --> 08:21.401
OR STEP OFF.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.605
WAYNEWAYNE OUT-OUT.

08:28.408 --> 08:29.710
[together]
WE DON'T LIKE HIM.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.045
- YES, YOU DO.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.146
YOU ALL DO.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.215
HE'S THE BAD BOY,

08:35.282 --> 08:37.117
AND HE'S STAYING
AT THE PALMWOODS.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.820
SO BE GOOD BOYS

08:39.887 --> 08:42.890
AND MAKE FRIEND-FRIENDS
WITH WAYNEWAYNE.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.091

08:45.726 --> 08:48.361
[knocks on door]

08:48.428 --> 08:51.431
- IT'S MOLLY
AND NOT THE AXE LUNATIC.

08:52.933 --> 08:53.934
- HELLO, MRS. KNIGHT.

08:54.001 --> 08:54.968
CAN KATIE PLAY?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.370
- KATIE, MOLLY'S HERE.

08:57.437 --> 09:00.107
- I'M GONNA BE IN HERE
IN A LONG WHILE.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.310
TOO MUCH FRIED FOOD.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.847
- MAYBE LATER, MOLLY.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.348
- OKAY.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.352
- IS SHE GONE?

09:12.419 --> 09:14.622
- I KNOW YOU WERE PLAYING
VIDEO GAMES IN THERE.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.625
- THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH HER.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.326
- KATIE, YOU CAN'T
JUDGE A PERSON

09:19.392 --> 09:20.293
BEFORE YOU GET TO KNOW THEM.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.629
- REALLY?

09:21.629 --> 09:23.330
BECAUSE YOU JUDGED
THAT GUY WITH AN AXE

09:23.396 --> 09:24.898
WITHOUT GETTING TO KNOW HIM.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.533
MAYBE HE WAS
A NICE MAINTENANCE MAN

09:26.634 --> 09:27.968
WHO WAS CUTTING A JELLY DONUT.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.402
- OH, I THINK I CAN
TELL THE DIFFERENCE

09:29.469 --> 09:31.404
BETWEEN AN AXE LUNATIC
AND A DONUT ENTHUSIAST.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.076
NOW, HELP ME TAKE OUT
THE GARBAGE.

I TOLD YOU TO STORE THESE
MANNEQUINS IN THE BASEMENT.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.564
- WHY DO WE HAVE MANNEQUINS?

09:57.665 --> 10:00.167

10:22.656 --> 10:23.657
WHO HAVE NO INTEREST IN US--

10:23.724 --> 10:24.758
BUT IT'S STILL NOT FAIR.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.195

WE'RE GONNA GET RID OF HIM.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.429
KENDALL, GET RID OF HIM.

10:29.496 --> 10:30.497
- WHY ME?

10:30.563 --> 10:32.432
- BECAUSE HE SCARES US.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.005
- WE ARE A BAND.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.440
AND WE'RE GONNA DO THIS
TOGETHER,

10:40.507 --> 10:43.811
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT AFRAID
OF SOME LOUDMOUTH,

MY CONTRACT STATES

11:18.378 --> 11:20.748
THAT I'M GUARANTEED
TO FRONT A BAND,

11:20.748 --> 11:21.815
AND I PICKED THIS BAND.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.117
- OOH, A CONTRACT.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.753
WE'RE SO SCARED.

11:25.753 --> 11:28.989

THAT I GET A POSSE.

11:29.056 --> 11:29.957

- MAN, HE EVEN MAKES SIPPING
OUT OF A COCONUT LOOK TOUGH.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.858
- FOCUS.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.960
ONE OF US IS GONNA GET
KICKED OUT OF THE BAND.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.128
- MY MONEY'S ON LOGAN.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.297
- MEAN.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.065
- NOBODY'S BREAKING US UP.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.433
- WE'RE A TEAM.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.936
WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF WAYNEWAYNE
OR ANYBODY ELSE.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.241
- OH, RELAX,
I DIDN'T GET THE PART.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.709
MAYBE THROWING
THE CASTING DIRECTOR

12:22.810 --> 12:24.511
IN A FLYING HEADLOCK
WAS A BAD IDEA.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.580
- CAMILLE, WE'RE IN AN URGENT
SAVE-OUR-BAND MISSION RIGHT NOW.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.954

12:37.124 --> 12:39.860

FOR A BAD BOY ROLE.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.661
WE WORKED TOGETHER ON

12:58.178 --> 13:00.613
[laughter]

13:00.680 --> 13:02.983
- I GUESS I'M THE ONE
THAT NEEDS THE TOWEL.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.886
[laughter]

13:05.953 --> 13:09.356
- SO WAYNEWAYNE DIDN'T GROW UP
ON THE MEAN STREETS OF DETROIT.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.058
- HE GREW UP IN A MANSION
IN DALLAS.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.493
HIS DAD INVENTED
TOAST ON A ROPE.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.196
- AND HE'S GONNA KICK ONE OF US
OUT OF THE BAND?

13:16.263 --> 13:18.298
WELL, WE'RE GONNA KICK HIM
OUT OF THE BAND,

13:18.365 --> 13:22.169
'CAUSE WE DON'T NEED

HE'S BEHIND ME AGAIN,

13:25.205 --> 13:26.173
- HEY, WALLY.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.440
- HEY, CAMILLE.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.775
OH, AND NEWS FLASH:

13:28.876 --> 13:32.012
THIS TOWN IS FULL OF PHONIES,
AND NOBODY CARES.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.513

13:33.580 --> 13:37.550
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK OF

OKAY?

13:44.124 --> 13:45.425
GRIFFIN HAS THE POWER,

13:45.492 --> 13:46.927
AND HE'LL GET RID OF
WHOEVER I SAY,

13:46.994 --> 13:49.229
AND I SAY...

13:49.296 --> 13:50.230
IT'S YOU.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.101
AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT,

13:54.167 --> 13:56.769

OKAY, STOP THIS;

14:05.979 --> 14:06.980
- WHAT?

14:07.047 --> 14:08.916
- WAYNEWAYNE IS A TOTAL FRAUD.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.817

OUT OF THE BAND.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.619
REALLY?
I WOULD'VE BET ON LOGAN.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.121
- [laughs]

14:14.187 --> 14:15.588
WELL, YOU WOULD HAVE LOST.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.090

14:17.157 --> 14:18.959
WE CAN'T LET WAYNEWAYNE
KICK KENDALL OUT OF THE BAND.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.661
GUSTAVO, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

14:21.728 --> 14:23.663
- NOTHING.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.098
- YOU CAN'T DO NOTHING.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.000
- GUSTAVO,
YOU CAN'T LET THIS POSER

14:27.067 --> 14:28.601
TELL YOU WHAT TO DO
WITH YOUR BAND.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.306
- IT'S NOT MY BAND, OKAY?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.608
IT'S GRIFFIN'S.

14:35.675 --> 14:36.643
LOOK.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.978
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

14:38.045 --> 14:40.580
BUT I HAVEN'T HAD A HIT
IN A WHILE.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.849
THIS BAND IS MY TICKET
BACK TO THE TOP,

14:42.950 --> 14:45.685
AND UNTIL I GET BACK THERE...

14:45.752 --> 14:47.955

- I'LL BE THE SNOWMAN.

14:53.593 --> 14:54.995
- AND YOU'LL NEED A TREE HAT.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.465
- NO TREE HAT!

14:58.531 --> 14:59.967
- GUSTAVO, WE CAN COME UP
WITH A PLAN.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.768
- OOH, THEY ARE REALLY GOOD
AT PLANS.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.403
- NO PLANS.

15:03.470 --> 15:06.173
I DON'T WANT YOU HOCKEY HEADS
PULLING ANY OF YOUR SCHEMES

15:06.239 --> 15:08.175
