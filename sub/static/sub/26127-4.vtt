WEBVTT

00:16.183 --> 00:17.851
Go ahead and take your watch off.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.149
- Do you have any cash on you?
- No, sir, I do not.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.487
I'm gonna have to give you
a pair of flip-flops,

00:28.570 --> 00:30.197
'cause they're steel toe, right?

00:30.280 --> 00:33.033
<i>I've never been in trouble before
in my whole life.</i>

00:33.659 --> 00:36.995
This time, right here, is the very first
time I've ever been incarcerated.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.748
- Thank you, ma'am.
- You're welcome.

00:42.125 --> 00:42.960
I'm one of them...

00:47.214 --> 00:48.674
although I'm not one of them.

00:56.682 --> 00:57.891
Fuck.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.766
The hardest part of the first day in jail
is just coming to grips

01:39.850 --> 01:44.021
with the reality that your liberty is
no longer a privilege to you.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.941
Everything stops for us in here.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.903
Stuff running through your head, and you
don't know when you'll get out again.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.242
That first day coming in
is a hit of reality.

01:58.827 --> 02:02.664
You know, it's just not a place to be.
Jail is not a place to be, period.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.125
Okay, turn around for me.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.086
You okay? You need medical?

02:08.169 --> 02:10.505
- My shoulder hurts.
- Your shoulder hurts?

02:12.966 --> 02:15.302
<i>I've never been in trouble
with the law before.</i>

02:15.886 --> 02:18.013
<i>This is my first time being arrested.</i>

02:18.805 --> 02:21.224
You in a bad mood today?
Don't be like that.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.936
Okay, I need you to take
your glasses off, please.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.774
Look at camera number one,
right here, ma'am.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.906
Ma'am, you're making me laugh
'cause you're so upset!

02:38.033 --> 02:40.410
We're going to go ahead
and put you in a uniform

02:40.494 --> 02:42.204
so that you're not... nude.

02:43.246 --> 02:47.042
When I was arrested I said to them,
"Look, I don't have any clothes on."

02:47.501 --> 02:50.295
And they pulled my arm behind me
and cuffed me anyway.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.507
And I gotta go to the bathroom.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.057
She had to do a lot
to hide the bald spots.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.026
It doesn't matter what your situation is.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.946
You're a criminal
once you come through those doors.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.328
This your first time in jail?

03:23.412 --> 03:24.454
- Yeah.
- Welcome.

03:24.538 --> 03:29.251
Oh, yeah, it's so good to be here...
with you fine folks. Yeah.

03:29.418 --> 03:30.961
First time ever arrested.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.296
- Wow.
- 46 years old.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.173
Damn! Shit! All right, fool!

03:35.257 --> 03:38.051
- No shit! Fuck!
- Appreciate it, yeah.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.471
- I knew I'd meet some friends in here.
- You want to meet a killer?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.348
- Nice to meet you. Yeah.
- How you doing?

03:43.432 --> 03:45.976
If you want to meet someone
who didn't pay their child support...

03:46.810 --> 03:47.644
this guy.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.317
I'm in here because I fell in love
with the wrong woman.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.406
We've only been divorced
for about 18 months.

03:59.489 --> 04:03.201
I've been able to pay child support
for most of that 18 months.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.120
But then just recently...

04:05.704 --> 04:06.830
I can't.

04:06.913 --> 04:12.627
I'm three months behind, so the judge said
that I had to pay the $4,600,

04:12.711 --> 04:16.964
and he gave me a 90-day timeframe
to get that paid in,

04:17.048 --> 04:21.636
and I... could not... get it done.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.057
Taylor, Benjamin.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.937
- Stand in that yellow box for me.
- Yes, ma'am.

04:31.062 --> 04:36.526
- Are you currently working or in school?
- I'm currently in between opportunities.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.820
Employment opportunity, you like that?

04:43.742 --> 04:46.536
You're in here on a failure
to pay child support.

04:46.953 --> 04:53.919
Your bond amount has to be in cash
or a certified check of $4,629.24.

04:54.002 --> 04:57.172
Go down to the exit door, make a right,
and go around to number nine.

04:59.216 --> 05:03.303
I sure as hell never thought that I'd be
wondering how I was going to come up

05:03.386 --> 05:05.972
with $4,600 to keep me out of jail.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.310
I had a good career
in the pest control field,

05:10.393 --> 05:14.231
and I went from having, like,
40 or 50 grand in the bank

05:14.314 --> 05:18.318
on a regular basis, for years and years
and years, to having nothing.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.197
How did I get here? I mean, look at this.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.407
Look at this.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.848
Hell yeah, I've been waiting for this.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.480
Are you counting down
the hours?

05:55.564 --> 05:58.733
Uh, yeah, I've been counting down...
for days now.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.824
I'm in here for a violation of probation.

06:06.658 --> 06:10.287
Original charge was
a falsified police report.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.335
You sure you don't want to take
none of this stuff home, sir?

06:17.419 --> 06:20.463
No. Look, this is all I'm going
to the holding cell with.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.884
The number for my high school buddy

06:23.967 --> 06:27.762
and hopefully some free tickets
to see <i>Despicable Me 3.</i>

06:29.514 --> 06:30.348
Take the kid.

06:32.142 --> 06:36.813
It's been definitely a roller coaster
ever since, uh, me and my wife split up.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.651
It kinda crushed me not being able
to come home from work

06:41.735 --> 06:45.655
and, like, having my son,
you know, drop everything he's doing

06:45.739 --> 06:47.657
to come run and give me a hug or whatever.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.368
He's five. He'll be six in December.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.289
It was like I lost everything,
and drugs was the only thing

06:54.372 --> 06:55.790
that was going to get me...

06:56.541 --> 06:58.293
not necessarily happy, but like...

06:59.169 --> 07:00.170
take away the pain.

07:01.379 --> 07:05.091
But in the long run, it just...
it screws me over every time.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.387
I've been having dreams about the hallway
on the release.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.265
That long hallway. That long hallway.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.768
I can even picture the carpet.
It's, like, gray.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.733
What's going through your mind
just as you're counting down?

07:22.651 --> 07:24.694
Uh, basically, my girlfriend.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.488
Be happy to see her.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.157
And the three-day getaway
I'm about to take.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.533
Hardiman, It's time.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.496
Gonna go down to Florida.

07:34.579 --> 07:38.333
Gonna take my girlfriend down there
and hang out for the weekend.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.294
And come back to work on Monday.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.215
I work on cars.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.426
Not to toot my own horn or anything,
but I'm pretty good at what I do.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.391
I can't tell you the last time
I had a vacation,

07:54.474 --> 07:56.351
so, definitely looking forward to it.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.117
I've been waiting to go home all day.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.245
Been thinking about going home
for, like, the last two weeks

08:15.328 --> 08:16.997
because I've been in The Hole
for two weeks.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.376
The Hole, man, is something serious, bro.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.004
It's a make you or break you type thing.

08:24.963 --> 08:28.383
Solitary confinement,
also referred to as "The Hole",

08:28.466 --> 08:32.178
is the worst form of punishment here.

08:32.761 --> 08:36.640
Mouthing off to staff members,
being disrespectful towards staff members,

08:36.725 --> 08:38.977
can get an individual placed
in solitary confinement.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.395
We do not tolerate that behavior.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.233
I got locked down in The Hole
for being disrespectful...

08:45.734 --> 08:47.444
and, uh, standing at the door.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.778
Talking about some petty shit.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.824
It's like you're trapped in a box.
All you see is these four walls.

08:52.907 --> 08:56.578
We eat in the cell, we sleep in the cell,
we shit in the cell,

08:56.661 --> 08:58.747
everything we do is in the cell.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.623
That can drive a nigga crazy.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.128
Yo, bro!

09:06.296 --> 09:08.631
Hey, tell me when you see the deputy.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.844
I get out today. This is my last day.

09:12.927 --> 09:13.762
In The Hole?

09:13.845 --> 09:16.097
No, my last day, period.
I'm gonna get out.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.809
If you need me to relay a message, bro,
know what I'm saying, send that number.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.727
All right.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.981
My boy across the hall, like,
we would just talk.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.776
That's the only light
that I had got in The Hole.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.530
I'd never been in trouble
with the law before.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.324
I'm a ladies' dude.
That was me in school.

09:36.201 --> 09:39.120
Last summer, I got pulled over,
driving without my license.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.623
And I was put on probation.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.292
And then, about a month ago,
I was driving...

09:44.793 --> 09:48.379
probably about ten over,
and I seen Douglas County Police.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.714
He stopped me. Boom!

09:49.798 --> 09:51.341
"You caught a charge, a speeding charge.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.844
You violated probation, you gonna sit
in jail for a good 30 days."

09:56.346 --> 09:57.722
That reality had hit me.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.767
I was going to go to jail,
and I ain't never been to jail before.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.977
I kept asking him, like,
don't take me to jail, bro.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.438
Come on, I can't go to jail
for nothing. Not for this.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.652
Every single charge
that I got is misdemeanors, bro.

10:11.236 --> 10:14.572
You mess up for something small,
they gonna keep you in here, 'cause...

10:15.115 --> 10:17.534
it's a system to keep you in,
not keep you out.

10:28.044 --> 10:28.878
Hi.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.466
I'm trying to make this girl laugh
again.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.264
There she goes. I made her laugh.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.101
Yeah.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.978
Winning, in jail!

10:46.020 --> 10:47.063
She's cute, man.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.650
Why don't you have a seat
out that window?

10:50.733 --> 10:51.818
Oh, shit.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.405
And you, you gonna be in disciplinary
if you don't get out that window.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.698
Yes, ma'am.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.995
I went into court knowing
that I was gonna wind up going to jail.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.790
So I partied all night
the night before I came here.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.750
'Cause, woohoo! Why not?

11:11.796 --> 11:15.008
I met my wife through a conservative group
on Facebook.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.511
In the course of our dating,
she became pregnant.

11:18.595 --> 11:23.266
The only option for us was gonna be
to keep our child...

11:23.850 --> 11:27.061
and to get married,
to make it right with God.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.441
Fuck, yeah.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.652
<i>Our first one was a girl,
and then we had a boy</i>

11:34.736 --> 11:36.237
<i>about 18 months later.</i>

11:36.321 --> 11:37.155
What?

11:37.822 --> 11:39.866
<i>One day, I came home from work</i>

11:39.949 --> 11:45.580
<i>and just realized
that my wife and my kids... were gone.</i>

11:47.749 --> 11:51.419
It was just like
death by a thousand cuts.

11:53.338 --> 11:57.300
<i>The alcohol and the depression came on
very, very hard.</i>

11:57.884 --> 11:59.719
I had to have alcohol,
which brought depression,

11:59.802 --> 12:02.055
which brought more alcohol,
which brought more depression.

12:03.139 --> 12:06.059
I was drinking 30 Budweisers per day.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.562
After that, I lost my job...

12:10.146 --> 12:12.815
because of depression,
'cause I didn't have my kids.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.987
What I'm afraid of the most is
that they don't know how much I love them.

12:21.616 --> 12:24.702
Taylor, Benjamin, stand there.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.455
Come on down. Where your shoes at?

12:27.538 --> 12:29.707
Oh, thanks for not putting me in The Hole.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.961
I'm gonna put you in The Hole,
you keep yelling at them girls.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.966
I'm gonna put you in door number two

12:38.049 --> 12:41.302
so hopefully you can use the phone
and try to get yourself out of here.

12:44.055 --> 12:48.226
My brother is pretty much the only
close family that I have left...

12:48.726 --> 12:52.146
- I need to lean on him a little bit.
<i>- Hey, bud. How's it going?</i>

12:52.397 --> 12:54.274
I'm doing all right. Working.

12:54.816 --> 12:59.362
<i>I've been wanting to talk to you for
a few hours now, but this sucks, dude.</i>

13:00.029 --> 13:02.323
<i>30 people in a 15 by 15.</i>

13:02.407 --> 13:03.574
Yeah.

13:03.658 --> 13:06.327
I'm just wondering how many days
I have to do in here.

13:06.911 --> 13:07.745
<i>I don't know.</i>

13:07.829 --> 13:11.666
I'm not trying to be pushy, but I'm kind
of in that situation, you know?

13:13.001 --> 13:13.918
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:14.002 --> 13:17.964
<i>Just... think about what you're gonna do
when you can get out, man.</i>

13:18.047 --> 13:21.092
Yeah, I don't need any more thinking time
on that, man.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.511
It's just, it's not easy. I mean, I'm...

13:23.594 --> 13:26.139
<i>Just hang tight, man.
Nothing's gonna happen overnight.</i>

13:27.390 --> 13:28.850
Shit, man!

13:34.522 --> 13:37.567
If my brother does not come up
with the $4,600,

13:37.984 --> 13:44.115
then I have no release date, which means
that I could spend a whole lot of time

13:44.198 --> 13:46.492
here at Gwinnett County Detention Center,

13:46.576 --> 13:48.328
over a child support issue.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.131
Okay, ma'am, step in.

14:00.631 --> 14:01.924
- In there?
- Yes.

14:07.722 --> 14:11.851
I've lived in a subdivision in downtown
Lawrenceville 20 years now.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.396
I bought a house... alone...

14:15.480 --> 14:18.983
working full time,
and raising four children.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.196
Today, my husband lives there with me.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.075
We're pretty private people and...

14:28.034 --> 14:29.869
it's no drama.

14:30.995 --> 14:31.829
Ever.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.999
- What'd you do?
- Hm?

14:35.500 --> 14:36.959
What I didn't do...

14:37.043 --> 14:40.963
Some old drunken folk
I had stay in my house.

14:41.589 --> 14:45.468
I called the police to get them out, and
they came and said I can't put them out.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.887
I was like, "What do you mean?
This is my house."

14:47.970 --> 14:52.225
And the reason I even rent my rooms
is 'cause we're both senior citizens,

14:52.308 --> 14:54.435
my husband and I,
trying to make ends meet.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.146
They said, "Well, then you have to go
through eviction."

14:57.897 --> 14:59.482
- You from...
- They were stealing,

14:59.565 --> 15:01.150
they were damaging my property,

15:01.234 --> 15:03.569
- they broke my door frames.
- And you end up locked up?

15:04.153 --> 15:04.987
Because...

15:05.613 --> 15:10.743
little did I know, they were con artists.
They had done this before.

15:12.453 --> 15:15.581
When I went in the room
to get his clothes out, tell him to go,

15:15.665 --> 15:17.959
he went out the room, screaming,

15:18.334 --> 15:19.293
"She hit me!"

15:20.002 --> 15:22.255
And so, the officer believed them.

15:22.338 --> 15:25.883
And they cuffed me and brought me in,
charged me with simple battery.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.385
I ain't touched this guy!

15:27.885 --> 15:30.555
What do I look like?
Trying to fight some young person?

15:31.556 --> 15:34.016
I'm so sorry to hear
about your situation, though.

15:34.725 --> 15:39.188
No matter how you look at this,
I am the victim. It's messed up.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.690
You know how to do hair?

15:41.149 --> 15:43.609
- I was looking cute when I came in.
- You was cute!

15:43.693 --> 15:45.987
Yeah, but I had to take
all my bobby pins out.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.114
I got you. I got you.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.031
Let me see.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.242
Am I doing it, or are you?

15:51.325 --> 15:53.161
- I thought I was helping you.
- Uh-uh.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.745
I didn't ask for help.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.416
There you go.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.210
- Thank you.
- You poppin' for somethin' now!

16:06.466 --> 16:07.592
Finally, bro.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.222
They gonna finally free the king, man.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.808
<i>Francis, come on down.</i>

16:17.810 --> 16:19.103
Want me to turn the light off?

16:20.438 --> 16:23.858
<i>I can't believe I'm getting out.
Like, bro, am I really getting out?</i>

16:25.318 --> 16:27.862
<i>Felt reality coming, like,
"Yeah, you finna get out, bro.</i>

16:27.945 --> 16:31.532
<i>You finna be back in the real world,
and you finna be back right."</i>

16:36.746 --> 16:39.624
- Hey, baby.
<i>- Hey, baby.</i>

16:39.707 --> 16:43.169
Five o'clock is when
they're gonna release me.

16:43.878 --> 16:47.757
All I need you do do this evening is
stay out of trouble. That's it.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.218
<i>I can do that. I promise.</i>

16:50.301 --> 16:52.261
<i>You have one minute left.</i>

16:52.637 --> 16:54.639
- Fucking bitch.
- <i>I hate her.</i>

16:55.264 --> 16:57.767
Little does she know,
she's getting fired tonight.

16:57.934 --> 16:58.768
<i>You're so cute...</i>

16:59.810 --> 17:00.686
<i>I love you.</i>

17:01.729 --> 17:03.272
We're almost there, baby.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.108
<i>Thank you
for using Securus. Goodbye.</i>

17:32.927 --> 17:34.971
There's no words
to describe it.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.391
It doesn't seem like you're
in the United States anymore.

17:39.350 --> 17:43.020
They pack you in there
with a bunch of drunks,

17:43.104 --> 17:46.691
people that haven't showered,
people that got nasty feet,

17:46.774 --> 17:50.194
and then it just keeps getting nastier
because you can't get a shower in there,

17:50.278 --> 17:54.031
and it's so freaking cold,
it'll blow your mind.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.286
Gentlemen, everyone needs to wake up.

17:58.911 --> 17:59.787
Everybody get up!

18:01.122 --> 18:03.624
No talking
outside the holding cell, gentlemen.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.210
Single-file line,
one person behind the other.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.505
Who wants to trade meat for peanut?

18:09.589 --> 18:12.300
I got a peanut sandwich for
a meat sandwich. There you go. Awesome.

18:15.678 --> 18:18.806
I have to believe that my brother is
gonna be able to get me the money.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.308
I've got to believe that.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.649
- Hey, good morning, good morning.
<i>- Morning, man.</i>

18:29.108 --> 18:33.779
Little bit of news, they're getting ready
to move us to <i>gen-pop.</i>

18:34.280 --> 18:36.824
<i>You'll be a lot better
once you get in general population.</i>

18:36.907 --> 18:38.576
<i>Trust me. You'll have your own bed.</i>

18:38.659 --> 18:40.745
It'll be a lot better
when I get out of here.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.872
- Get me the fuck out of here, man.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

18:43.289 --> 18:44.749
Get me the fuck out of here.

18:44.832 --> 18:48.002
<i>Hey, listen. Just be humble
and mind your own business.</i>

18:48.085 --> 18:50.546
<i>I don't want you getting
into a tussle with anybody.</i>

18:52.715 --> 18:54.467
I can't believe this is happening.

18:55.843 --> 18:56.886
Get me out of here.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.731
All the way around.

19:15.237 --> 19:19.200
My number one goal is to
just get my son back in my life.

19:22.453 --> 19:26.165
But if I start slipping back
into that lifestyle again,

19:26.248 --> 19:28.167
I think that's my worst enemy.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.044
- Hi.
- Let me have your armband.

19:31.045 --> 19:33.923
Just stay away from drugs
and just got to work

19:34.006 --> 19:36.425
and do what I need to do,
be there for my son.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.387
Then I feel like nothing's against me.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.976
When someone is on the verge
of being released,

19:46.060 --> 19:50.398
I'm sure they're thinking, "I'm happy
because I'm out of... out of jail."

19:50.481 --> 19:53.484
They have all these dreams
of what their life will look like,

19:53.567 --> 19:55.695
but things don't always turn out that way.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.988
It can be a struggle
to get back to normal.

19:58.072 --> 20:01.951
<i>Me and my girlfriend, we've been talking
on the phone every day for 30 days</i>

20:02.034 --> 20:04.203
<i>and had this day planned out to a T.</i>

20:04.870 --> 20:06.872
<i>Head on down south to Florida.</i>

20:08.082 --> 20:10.251
<i>And I'm gonna be in heaven
for a little bit.</i>

20:18.843 --> 20:20.177
Perfect timing.

20:21.804 --> 20:22.638
Hi.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.140
Mmm...

20:27.059 --> 20:29.395
Let's never do that again, okay?

20:31.522 --> 20:32.773
Is this gas gauge right?

20:34.150 --> 20:35.609
Yeah, we need gas.

20:38.446 --> 20:39.864
You got any cash on you?

20:41.323 --> 20:43.159
I got $2 on a gift card.

20:45.119 --> 20:48.789
So you got $2, no gas...

20:50.750 --> 20:51.584
Damn.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.086
I did the best I could, baby.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.423
How we going to make it there
with no goddamn gas?

21:02.094 --> 21:03.012
Hi, welcome.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.889
We're scrimping funds here.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.976
I think this is, like, $1.20 or something.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.274
So what happened?

21:16.525 --> 21:17.610
- Huh?
- What happened?

21:18.527 --> 21:19.528
I got some on there.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.659
I so totally had a different vision...

21:26.160 --> 21:27.620
of how this day was gonna go.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.122
I know. Uh...

21:31.040 --> 21:33.459
You have left us in a bind, you know that?

21:44.470 --> 21:48.641
Two fingers on your left hand like this...
Press down harder on your fingertips.

21:51.185 --> 21:54.855
My sister is in the lobby area...
waiting to come pick me up.

21:56.023 --> 21:56.899
We out.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.987
Me and my sister are, like, real close.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.990
She was basically almost my second mom.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.952
She's treated me like I was her own child.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.163
Hey, sis! You came and got me!

22:12.039 --> 22:14.124
- How are you?
- What's up?

22:14.208 --> 22:15.042
Learned your lesson?

22:15.125 --> 22:16.919
Yeah. Hey, man, can you take me home?

22:18.337 --> 22:21.423
I can't believe I'm out on the streets.
I gotta see this.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.009
Oh, my God, I ain't seen this in a month.

22:25.261 --> 22:28.264
- So, are you finished with that stuff?
- Oh, yeah, all done.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.642
All of this you've been getting
in trouble for is stupid stuff.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.895
- But...
- You already have two strikes against you.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.480
You're a man and you're black.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.399
I don't want you to be a statistic.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.693
I do not want you to be
in the prison system.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.361
I do not want you to be dead.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.780
I don't want you to be one of those men

22:44.864 --> 22:49.493
who can't make it because they have
a background... over petty stuff.

22:49.577 --> 22:54.290
And you have an opportunity,
you're 19, to change this around.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.418
I was going straight, too,
but I was going on a right arrow...

22:57.501 --> 23:00.546
- Was you speeding?
- No, I was only going nine over. I was...

23:00.629 --> 23:01.755
That's speeding!

23:02.673 --> 23:04.550
This stuff is stupid.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.846
My mindset is very different now, Raquel.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.765
I don't want to be that same person
I was before before I was locked up.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.393
I want to be somebody different.
Try to do something different.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.981
- What, do you got a job tomorrow?
- There you go.

23:19.064 --> 23:22.401
You need to go get your stuff so you
can bring my car back by nine o'clock.

23:36.457 --> 23:40.461
When are they gonna book me?
Nothing can happen until they book me.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.796
You could make a free phone call
if you want to call.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.799
They told me they have to book me first,
and they haven't booked me yet.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.093
Girl, use that phone.

23:49.303 --> 23:50.638
I can call somebody right now?

23:50.721 --> 23:52.848
Yes, press one twice, and then the number.

23:52.932 --> 23:53.974
Are you kidding me?

23:55.100 --> 23:57.061
- Yeah...
- What?

23:57.853 --> 23:59.438
Why didn't they tell me?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.650
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey.

24:02.733 --> 24:03.567
<i>Hey.</i>

24:03.651 --> 24:05.361
<i>Let me tell you, when I came back,</i>

24:05.444 --> 24:08.447
<i>that son of a gun was in there,
he had carved up that turkey breast,</i>

24:08.530 --> 24:12.618
<i>he was heating it up and was laughing at
me in my face with a butcher knife.</i>

24:12.701 --> 24:14.036
<i>Licking his... licking it.</i>

24:15.788 --> 24:19.416
<i>I talked to a police officer, too.
They said there's nothing they can do.</i>

24:19.959 --> 24:22.586
The police officer said
there's nothing he can do.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.630
<i>We'll talk about that when you get out.</i>

24:24.713 --> 24:27.758
<i>- Let's think about getting you out.</i>
- All right, bye.

24:29.635 --> 24:30.636
He's a wreck.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.888
- You could tell?
- He's a wreck.

24:34.932 --> 24:36.767
- Mrs. Stephens?
- Yes.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.603
Please stand on the yellow square for me

24:41.230 --> 24:42.982
You're being charged with battery.

24:43.065 --> 24:44.900
You have a $1,300 bond.

24:44.984 --> 24:48.028
You can pay for it with a bail bondsman,
property, or have somebody come

24:48.112 --> 24:49.154
and pay that for you.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.867
How do you get away with arresting
somebody for something

24:53.951 --> 24:56.245
that there's no proof,
there's no witnesses, nothing?

24:56.912 --> 24:59.498
Why am I sitting in jail
for a battery charge?

25:12.428 --> 25:15.431
I'm ready to get back
to my regular routine, making my money,

25:15.514 --> 25:17.975
chilling it with females,
kicking it with my bros.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.730
The little stuff, I'm gonna cherish it.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.356
Cherish it.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.445
Why the fuck was the door unlocked, bro?

25:29.862 --> 25:31.071
Bro, what...

25:31.613 --> 25:32.489
the...

25:33.073 --> 25:33.907
fuck?!

25:34.491 --> 25:36.118
Somebody been in here, bro.

25:36.994 --> 25:40.748
See that shit? I tell you, everything
in this motherfucker is gone, bro.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.666
And I had money in here.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.336
The money I had
in the motherfucking couch is gone.

25:47.421 --> 25:50.966
They ripped the couch open
and took the money out the couch.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.428
I told y'all niggas to watch my shit
while I was in jail,

25:54.511 --> 25:56.513
and none of y'all niggas did that shit.

25:56.597 --> 25:57.890
That's what's making me mad.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.184
When it was their shit,
they got their shit out of here.

26:00.267 --> 26:03.479
You see, you can go look in all the other
rooms, all these niggas' shit is gone.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.607
But these niggas left my shit,
with the door unlocked.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.776
And not thinking nobody gonna run
in this shit...

26:09.443 --> 26:11.820
and take every single thing
out this bitch.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.363
It's y'all fault.

26:15.324 --> 26:18.744
Y'all niggas is
irre-fuckin'- sponsible as fuck.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.413
And it's not even the fucking hood.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.583
This is a fucking goddamn white area, bro.

26:29.296 --> 26:34.551
Mendez, Miles, Taylor A, Taylor B,
let's ride!

26:36.136 --> 26:40.933
I'm getting, I think it's called
"dressed in" or "dressed down".

26:41.850 --> 26:45.646
I don't know much else about it except
I'm gonna get rid of these clothes

26:45.729 --> 26:47.856
and put... jail fatigues on.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.152
If you can't make bond,
and that 48 hours is up,

26:52.236 --> 26:53.862
now you have to be dressed in.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.700
General population is the housing unit
that they're gonna live in.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.578
I can imagine
that's an extremely scary thing,

27:01.912 --> 27:04.331
especially if they've never been
in jail before.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.209
You can have a minor charge
and be in a room

27:07.292 --> 27:10.796
with somebody who's committed
multiple murders. You have no idea.

27:11.338 --> 27:12.172
To your right.

27:17.010 --> 27:20.055
All right, gentlemen, listen up.
This is the orientation unit.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.016
From here, you'll be going
to your permanent housing unit.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.561
We're gonna be watching
an orientation video.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.522
It will cover rules and regulations.

27:28.605 --> 27:34.027
<i>When a new inmate arrives at a facility,
um, they don't usually have money.</i>

27:34.111 --> 27:37.406
<i>So another inmate will offer
to provide them with commissary,</i>

27:37.489 --> 27:39.658
<i>and they'll demand sexual favors.</i>

27:49.710 --> 27:51.587
<i>- Oh, hey.</i>
- Hey, man.

27:51.670 --> 27:56.133
Tonight's my first night on the block, in
the yard, you know what I'm saying?

27:56.216 --> 27:57.384
<i>Uh...</i>

27:58.010 --> 28:00.512
<i>I don't think that's
a bad thing, necessarily.</i>

28:02.764 --> 28:05.017
What do you think I should say to that?

28:05.601 --> 28:08.854
<i>There seems to be
a unanimous consideration</i>

28:08.937 --> 28:10.856
<i>that this is like free treatment for you,</i>

28:10.939 --> 28:13.275
<i>even though you don't have
the counselors, or whatever.</i>

28:14.568 --> 28:17.362
This is not free treatment.
This is not treatment, bro.

28:18.363 --> 28:19.698
Shit, man.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.996
I feel a sense of let-down.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.790
This is not rehab.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.667
This is not counseling.

28:32.336 --> 28:33.212
I needed help.

28:34.338 --> 28:35.547
This is not help.

28:36.340 --> 28:37.382
This is hell.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.676
Look around.

29:53.458 --> 29:54.293
Fuck.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.379
One more grind and struggle for us.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.631
- Yeah.
- We're out of gas.

30:01.383 --> 30:03.051
Jules, Jules, Jules.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.096
Wow... Shit.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.390
Jules. Jules.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.893
I need you to get over here and steer.
I gotta push this motherfucker.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.103
Oh, dear God.

30:23.113 --> 30:25.282
Honey, Jules, steer!

30:26.325 --> 30:27.826
- Steer!
- I am!

30:29.411 --> 30:32.247
Turn the goddamned wheel
and don't hit the fucking brake!

30:36.418 --> 30:37.627
Turn the wheel!

30:37.711 --> 30:40.005
- Baby!
- Turn the wheel to the right!

30:47.346 --> 30:49.514
- Turn the fucking wheel to the right.
- I am!

30:49.598 --> 30:51.266
To the right! You're not turning it.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.979
Julia, turn the goddamn wheel!

31:03.945 --> 31:09.284
So, unfortunately, I need you to look
for every motherfucking penny we got.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.869
Come on, help me out, Jules.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.580
- I heard you. Take the, take your...
- Well, you're not doing shit.

31:13.663 --> 31:17.125
You're sitting here cussing at me for
nothing. How do you want me to react...

31:17.209 --> 31:18.960
I want you to fucking help me!

31:24.216 --> 31:28.720
They put me here and left those people
in my house, unattended.

31:28.804 --> 31:29.971
I did not touch him.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.099
He said,
"Well, where did that bruise come from?"

31:32.182 --> 31:37.145
I said, "Hell, if I know! He's white!
You could... You hit..." It's true!

31:37.813 --> 31:39.606
You could pinch him, they gonna bruise!

31:39.689 --> 31:41.691
It ain't nothing against anybody white.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.026
My husband is white.

31:43.110 --> 31:43.944
Okay?

31:51.785 --> 31:52.619
<i>Hello?</i>

31:53.370 --> 31:56.998
The officer said I could get out
on a property bond, so...

31:57.082 --> 31:58.834
you go in the top drawer...

31:59.251 --> 32:01.211
and get one of the mortgage statements.

32:01.711 --> 32:04.714
It's either in the chest
on the left-hand side,

32:04.798 --> 32:07.509
or it's right next to it,
outside of the chest,

32:07.592 --> 32:10.095
on top of those gray plastic containers.

32:10.178 --> 32:13.682
<i>Okay. We should be coming to get you out
in about a little over an hour.</i>

32:13.765 --> 32:15.350
Okay. All right, bye.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.658
Got to walk this brisk mile right here.

32:35.745 --> 32:39.749
Luckily, someone gave us two dollars
to put with our 45 cents,

32:39.833 --> 32:41.418
and we have...

32:41.501 --> 32:44.504
1.1 gallons to hopefully make it
to Florida.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.965
Otherwise, I'm gonna be walking some more.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.430
I definitely don't think I'm a criminal.

32:57.017 --> 33:01.104
I just feel like I'm getting caught
in the wrong situation at the wrong time.

33:05.108 --> 33:07.611
I just want to stay
out of the system and...

33:07.694 --> 33:10.071
I feel like if I can stay
out of the system,

33:10.155 --> 33:12.741
then I can get my feet more planted.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.495
Just more... stable, you know?

33:20.540 --> 33:23.293
<i>The time I felt most stable
in my life was...</i>

33:23.960 --> 33:26.338
probably when my son was born.

33:27.631 --> 33:31.635
You know, I felt a whole different type
of love that I never knew I had.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.888
So I want to keep that in my life.

33:35.931 --> 33:39.226
And then also, I don't want him
to go through what I went through.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.688
I never had a dad, really.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.149
He would be in and out of my life...

33:46.733 --> 33:50.362
and making empty promises to come see me
and this and that.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.864
When me and my wife first split up...

33:53.448 --> 33:56.159
I felt myself being exactly like him

33:56.243 --> 33:59.120
and I can even remember sending him
a text saying,

33:59.663 --> 34:02.749
"I'm starting to realize
that I'm starting to be just like you

34:02.832 --> 34:04.417
and I hate every moment of it."

34:19.224 --> 34:20.433
So, basically...

34:23.520 --> 34:26.313
it just drives me to push harder.

34:32.946 --> 34:37.242
I'm mad because I specifically asked
y'all niggas to watch my shit.

34:37.617 --> 34:40.078
And y'all pulled a dumb-ass move
and kept the door unlocked.

34:41.121 --> 34:42.871
Y'all niggas is gettin y'all ass beat,

34:42.956 --> 34:48.210
and then niggas gonna be like, "Oh, bro,
uh..." Shut up! I don't want to hear that.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.301
I'm hot right now,
and I'm really just trying to stay calm.

34:54.384 --> 34:58.013
I'm happy I'm in the free world again,
and I'm not trying to go back to jail.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.891
Trying to be a better person.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.852
And me going over there,

35:03.935 --> 35:06.688
beating somebody up, is not gonna
make me a better person.

35:07.439 --> 35:10.650
I didn't go to jail to come back out
with the same mindset.

35:10.734 --> 35:13.361
And that's that's what I told you,
like I told my sister.

35:14.738 --> 35:17.616
Yeah, my sister said
that she needs her car at nine.

35:18.450 --> 35:22.996
So I have so much respect for my sister
to bring back her car before nine.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.213
I said the same shit.

35:32.839 --> 35:33.673
Hey, sis!

35:49.981 --> 35:50.899
Stephens.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.859
You're being released.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.032
Come around this way.

36:02.535 --> 36:05.872
When I go home,
I'm gonna take some pain medicine,

36:05.955 --> 36:08.249
get in the bathtub, and get into bed.

36:14.714 --> 36:15.840
Here's your other items.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.761
Leave them inside the bag, please.

36:22.013 --> 36:22.972
Sign right there.

36:24.891 --> 36:27.143
Take that sheet of paper with you
along with the rest of your property.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.770
Step through the door
with the glass in it.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.357
- Can't you follow directions?
- I'm sorry?

36:32.440 --> 36:34.651
I asked you to leave them inside the bag,
that's what I asked you.

36:34.734 --> 36:35.735
Yeah, a minute ago.

36:36.403 --> 36:37.320
And?

36:37.737 --> 36:38.571
Yes.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.533
I can't put my ring on?

36:42.117 --> 36:44.577
Now, I can hold onto it for you,
send you downstairs,

36:44.661 --> 36:46.287
and have you wait
for me to walk it down to you.

36:46.663 --> 36:48.039
Okay, have a good day, too.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.380
I'm convinced...

36:56.131 --> 37:01.469
that everybody in here has taken classes
on how to be a class-A asshole.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.680
Because to be on point...

37:05.223 --> 37:07.684
it's just too much of a coincidence.

37:09.269 --> 37:13.732
Unbelievable. Are all jails like this,
or is it just this one?

37:30.331 --> 37:34.419
<i>I don't know how I find the willpower
to keep going. I just do.</i>

37:35.628 --> 37:38.757
<i>And all these obstacles, like,
I'd do this a hundred times over</i>

37:38.840 --> 37:40.592
<i>than to be in Gwinnett County Jail.</i>

37:56.775 --> 37:58.485
What's up, what up, what up, man?

37:58.568 --> 38:00.987
What's up, baby?
What's up, what's up, what's up?

38:01.070 --> 38:03.072
I got something for y'all, you feel me?

38:03.156 --> 38:05.700
My support system is A-1.
I'm not a troubled kid.

38:06.159 --> 38:07.577
I know what I'm about to do.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.079
Man, you know,
I was in The Hole for about two weeks.

38:10.163 --> 38:12.290
- Right.
- I'm in that hole, and they can't hold me.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.459
Man, crank that beat, man.
You know what I'm saying?

38:30.350 --> 38:31.559
You can't take that off.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.102
- Gotta keep it on?
- Yeah.

38:33.186 --> 38:36.564
I figured, I didn't know the rules,
but I figured if I broke them,

38:36.648 --> 38:38.983
somebody would certainly tell me.
Okay.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.508
- Yoshua, how old are you?
- 19.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.927
An immigration officer arrested me.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.429
They're trying to send me
back to my country for shoplifting.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.558
- I was supposed to get married tomorrow.
- Goddamn.

39:11.641 --> 39:13.560
<i>We need to get married ASAP.</i>

39:13.643 --> 39:16.688
I already had it all planned out.
Ring's waiting at home.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.524
I really love this girl.
She's always been there for me.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.026
Breaks my heart.
Everything just falls apart.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.904
I don't know what's going on.
Immigration is gonna send you back...

39:24.988 --> 39:28.992
I was really hoping that... It breaks
my heart that I can't come back...

39:29.492 --> 39:33.288
I wish I could go back in time
and... make things different.
