WEBVTT

00:07.001 --> 00:09.561
You and me are the same.

00:10.081 --> 00:14.321
Billy Pettigrew wasn't
eaten by a bear. He was murdered.

00:14.521 --> 00:15.361
Agh!

00:15.401 --> 00:17.681
Shirley.
- No, thank you.

00:17.721 --> 00:19.241
You were feeding her to death.

00:19.281 --> 00:21.081
You are a beautiful little bird.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.961
So you were protecting me.
- You're the Governor.

00:24.001 --> 00:25.761
And you are the Sheriff.

00:25.801 --> 00:27.041
That's how it works.

00:27.081 --> 00:30.281
What if Dan Anderssen loves Petra Bergen?

00:30.321 --> 00:31.601
Loves you?

00:31.641 --> 00:34.681
I know you're badly alcoholic.
Don't worry, I can change that.

00:35.761 --> 00:37.441
I heard something.

00:48.921 --> 00:49.961
Vincent?

00:55.281 --> 00:58.601

00:59.201 --> 01:02.321

02:00.681 --> 02:02.681
Oh, you're awake.

02:08.881 --> 02:10.881
Sore head?
- Yes.

02:11.801 --> 02:12.961
Sore.

02:13.641 --> 02:15.641
My head is sore...

02:21.801 --> 02:23.801
I have some painkillers.

02:30.001 --> 02:32.321
Would you open your mouth a little?

02:45.841 --> 02:47.121
Better?

02:50.401 --> 02:51.721
Where am I?

02:52.561 --> 02:54.721
You're in the hospital.

02:54.761 --> 02:56.921
In an isolation room.

02:56.961 --> 02:59.321
And who are you?
- Dr Schweitzer.

02:59.921 --> 03:01.081
How...

03:02.001 --> 03:05.201
How did I get here?
- You don't remember?

03:06.481 --> 03:07.721
No.

03:10.321 --> 03:11.761
Nothing.

03:12.401 --> 03:16.001
The police found you
in a basement in a house.

03:17.241 --> 03:19.641
You were chained up
in a filthy, soiled bed.

03:20.561 --> 03:23.041
You had been drugged with chloroform.

03:23.081 --> 03:26.161
There was stolen,
malfunctioning medical equipment.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.361
Chloroform?
- You're safe now, Natalie.

03:36.961 --> 03:39.241
Why am I...

03:40.961 --> 03:43.321
Why am I restrained?
- You have a parasite.

03:45.801 --> 03:48.201
What?
- Inside you.

03:50.281 --> 03:51.761
I know what it is, this parasite.

03:51.801 --> 03:54.441
While it's inside you,
you are a danger to other people.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.361
You know?

03:59.281 --> 04:00.921
How could you know about it?

04:00.961 --> 04:04.241
Nobody knows about this thing inside me.
Only me and Vincent know.

04:04.281 --> 04:05.441
Who the fuck are you?

04:09.681 --> 04:11.401
Who the fuck are you?

04:20.361 --> 04:22.561
I remember your fiancée.

04:23.761 --> 04:25.441
Shirley.

04:25.481 --> 04:28.081
How she loved her food.

04:30.481 --> 04:32.321
- Yes, she did.
- Huh.

04:33.321 --> 04:36.361
A beautiful big Viking of a woman.

04:36.401 --> 04:40.681
Proud and strong and full of life.

04:42.001 --> 04:44.201
She was all of those things.

04:45.321 --> 04:46.921
You must miss her.

04:47.761 --> 04:49.441
I do.

04:49.481 --> 04:51.161
But things change.

04:54.601 --> 04:56.001
I miss Hildur.

04:58.041 --> 04:59.601
It's so funny, you know.

04:59.641 --> 05:03.121
We used to do this very thing,
in this kitchen.

05:04.161 --> 05:06.721
Hildur would rustle up some food

05:06.761 --> 05:10.401
and we'd sit at this table
and get up to speed

05:10.441 --> 05:12.801
on everything that was concerning us
in Fortitude.

05:12.841 --> 05:15.081
Just like we are doing right now.
- Hmm.

05:18.401 --> 05:21.281
Hildur... was a bad cook.

05:21.961 --> 05:23.321
Was she?

05:23.361 --> 05:25.641
A great governor, poor cook.

05:29.641 --> 05:31.121
And er...

05:31.161 --> 05:32.601
Eric...

05:34.881 --> 05:39.201
...did he mind, you and Hildur
dining so intimately?

05:39.241 --> 05:40.441
Intimately?

05:43.841 --> 05:46.081
No. No, you're right.

05:46.121 --> 05:47.681
It was intimate.

05:49.161 --> 05:50.241
Yeah.

05:52.881 --> 05:54.881
Do you think...

05:56.121 --> 05:58.961
...that this is intimate now?

06:02.161 --> 06:03.761
Hmm.

06:03.801 --> 06:04.801
Tsk.

06:06.521 --> 06:08.841
I'm just fucking with you, Markus.

06:10.601 --> 06:14.161
Ah. Hildur would cook.

06:15.241 --> 06:19.041
And I would make us each...

06:19.081 --> 06:20.361
...a cocktail.

06:25.361 --> 06:27.361
You know where everything is?

06:28.601 --> 06:32.081
I'd try to surprise her
with something she'd never had before

06:33.921 --> 06:36.601
an... Old Fashioned

06:37.481 --> 06:39.761
a... Moscow Mule

06:41.401 --> 06:43.721
or a Screwdriver.

06:45.041 --> 06:47.521
What's the main ingredient
of an Old Fashioned?

06:49.161 --> 06:51.041
Whisky.
- Screwdriver?

06:51.081 --> 06:53.241
Vodka and orange juice.

06:55.921 --> 06:57.921
I'm going to have
to step up my game here.

07:01.641 --> 07:03.641
You know, Shirley, er...

07:03.681 --> 07:07.321
Shirley was partial
to a slow comfortable screw.

07:07.361 --> 07:10.681
Sloe gin and Southern Comfort.
- Mm-hm.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.481
Yes, I wasn't
referring to the alcoholic beverage.

07:23.961 --> 07:26.481
Oh, Markus, you devil.

07:29.121 --> 07:30.841
Mmm.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.921
Hildur Odegard.

07:36.881 --> 07:38.881
Hildur Odegard.

07:44.281 --> 07:46.001
Ahh.

07:48.481 --> 07:50.161
Hmm.

07:51.201 --> 07:52.921
You know...

07:53.601 --> 07:57.961
I was irrevocably altered
by the influence of the parasite inside me.

08:03.041 --> 08:04.321
And have you recovered from this?

08:05.361 --> 08:06.801
Oh, yes.

08:07.481 --> 08:10.001
Well... maybe not "recovered".

08:11.001 --> 08:13.361
I have um... developed.

08:13.401 --> 08:17.041
Might even say "evolved".

08:18.281 --> 08:19.561
Ha.

08:23.241 --> 08:25.161
You know, all my life

08:25.201 --> 08:27.561
I have found myself
in direct moral conflict

08:27.601 --> 08:30.001
with the values of those around me

08:30.041 --> 08:35.121
in matters of love, justice,
reward, human worth.

08:35.161 --> 08:37.721
So, as Governor

08:37.761 --> 08:39.441
how do you feel now?

08:43.681 --> 08:46.081
I feel liberated.
- Because?

08:48.881 --> 08:52.841
Because I no longer need to kowtow
and conform to petty considerations

08:52.881 --> 08:56.841
imposed by narrow-minded hypocrites
and small-town bigots.

08:58.561 --> 08:59.841
Oh.

08:59.881 --> 09:03.321
Here's to you, "Governor" Husekleppe.

09:14.641 --> 09:17.761
The um... electrician who killed himself.

09:18.281 --> 09:19.281
Vladek Klimov.

09:19.321 --> 09:22.121
Exactly. He was a shaman.

09:23.001 --> 09:25.201
So I believe.
- Hm.

09:25.241 --> 09:30.161
He nailed me to a pit prop
and told me some interesting things

09:30.201 --> 09:35.121
while I was hung up there off my tits,
drums and dancing.

09:35.961 --> 09:37.121
Such as?

09:40.881 --> 09:42.161
Shamans...

09:42.201 --> 09:44.721
aspire to a condition of power.

09:44.761 --> 09:50.921
But in order to attain that power
in its most pure and holy form

09:50.961 --> 09:59.161
the shaman is required to make a...
profound personal transition.

10:09.641 --> 10:14.521
The shaman believed that
the most powerful kind of shaman...

10:15.961 --> 10:17.521
...was a female shaman

10:17.561 --> 10:21.921
and if he wanted to become
that powerful... well...

10:22.601 --> 10:24.521
he must make that transition.

10:28.761 --> 10:32.481
Someone just put their hand inside me
and squeezed my heart.

10:33.281 --> 10:34.761
Quite firmly.

10:39.561 --> 10:41.601
I can hear a sound like bats hissing.

10:41.641 --> 10:45.201
Hildur Odegard was a powerful governor.

10:46.241 --> 10:49.081
The best governor Fortitude ever had.

10:50.001 --> 10:54.481
Do you aspire to be the best governor,
Markus Husekleppe?

10:54.521 --> 10:56.761
Don't eat this, there's plutonium in it.

10:56.801 --> 10:59.721
Then the shaman's example
is the one that you must embrace.

10:59.761 --> 11:02.121
Molecules are not our friends, Daniel.

11:02.161 --> 11:05.521
With my assistance, of course.
- I don't know what I'm saying.

11:05.561 --> 11:08.801
Am I speaking right now?
- Somebody is.

11:10.121 --> 11:12.201
Huh.
- What is this made of?

11:12.241 --> 11:16.001
Oh, well, this is crushed ice

11:16.041 --> 11:18.441
tonic water and lime cordial.

11:18.481 --> 11:24.241
Yours is crushed ice, tonic water,
lime cordial and... muscimol.

11:25.241 --> 11:27.961
Reindeer Juice Punch.
- That's right, sweetie.

11:28.001 --> 11:29.921
Are you gonna kill him?

11:29.961 --> 11:31.881
Don't kill me.

11:31.921 --> 11:35.001
Cutlery clattering
- I'm not gonna kill you, Markus.

11:36.321 --> 11:40.281
I'm gonna help him become
the best governor he can possibly be.

11:53.161 --> 11:54.561
What's happening?

11:55.721 --> 11:57.361
Elsa?

12:02.761 --> 12:05.401
That's the... the blonde girl...

12:06.561 --> 12:08.041
Er... Natalie...

12:08.081 --> 12:09.921
She has a parasite inside her.

12:11.681 --> 12:13.841
Parasite?
- I got her out, Michael.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.841
Got her out of where?
- The research centre.

12:21.481 --> 12:24.401
Who infected her?
- Dr Khatri's laboratory.

12:26.281 --> 12:28.161
Khatri died but her work goes on.

12:30.361 --> 12:32.081
Vincent Rattrey...

12:32.121 --> 12:33.241
Vincent?

12:33.281 --> 12:37.041
Michael, I know how to help her.
I know what to do.

12:44.361 --> 12:48.161
Vincent wouldn't do anything
to hurt Natalie.

12:48.721 --> 12:51.441
I have to go into town, find a pharmacy.

12:53.441 --> 12:55.641
There are things I need for her.

12:55.681 --> 12:58.081
If she wakes up,
give her some water to drink.

13:00.441 --> 13:01.841
Don't speak to her.

13:25.201 --> 13:27.641
Hello? Hey!

13:29.361 --> 13:30.961
Vincent?

14:18.881 --> 14:22.201
I know this looks really terrible.
But if you could just...

14:22.241 --> 14:24.761
Face down. On the floor! Now!

14:25.641 --> 14:26.801
Do it, now!
- OK!

14:26.841 --> 14:28.121
Or I shoot you!
- I know!

14:28.161 --> 14:30.241
I know this looks really awful,
like a...

14:31.521 --> 14:33.121
Please, just let me...

14:35.321 --> 14:37.001
Agh! Jesus...

14:37.041 --> 14:39.321
Ingrid...
- Dan! Eric!

14:39.361 --> 14:41.321
I'm bringing Vincent Rattrey in.

14:41.361 --> 14:43.481
Attempted... Hostage... and murderer...

14:43.521 --> 14:46.001
Ingrid...
- Shut the fuck up!

15:01.481 --> 15:03.921
You work here?
- Mm-hm.

15:05.841 --> 15:07.841
With Dr Schweitzer?

15:08.921 --> 15:13.001
I'm er... just kind of an orderly.

15:20.801 --> 15:24.521
I'm not in the...
medical research centre, am I?

15:26.361 --> 15:28.761
I can smell petrol and dust and damp.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.721
There's no Dr Schweitzer, is there?

15:33.561 --> 15:35.041
She...

15:35.081 --> 15:37.081
She wants... something from me.

15:39.281 --> 15:41.641
Something the parasite
is doing inside me.

15:41.681 --> 15:42.961
I have to go.

15:43.001 --> 15:47.441
Wait, where am I? Please don't go.
Please don't leave me.

15:47.481 --> 15:49.561
I know who you are.

15:50.521 --> 15:52.801
Please, your voice. I know you.

15:52.841 --> 15:54.441
Mr Lennox.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.321
You're Ingrid's father.

15:58.801 --> 16:00.881
Michael, why are you doing this?

16:04.041 --> 16:07.561
Why are you doing this!
Don't yell. Don't yell.

16:08.441 --> 16:10.001
Shh.
- Please!

16:10.041 --> 16:11.401
Please!
- Shh!

16:11.441 --> 16:13.241
Please help! Help!

16:13.281 --> 16:14.521
Please.
- No!

16:14.561 --> 16:16.441
Help, somebody, please!

16:16.481 --> 16:18.961
Somebody please help me! Please!

16:19.001 --> 16:21.001
Please! Please help!

16:26.481 --> 16:27.761
Help!

16:45.601 --> 16:47.361
I want a lawyer, now.

16:47.401 --> 16:50.801
Straightaway before I answer any questions
or you ask me any questions...

16:50.841 --> 16:52.481
You don't get a lawyer.
- Fuck off.

16:52.521 --> 16:53.561
Norwegian law.

16:53.601 --> 16:56.401
Kidnap victim in mortal jeopardy.

16:57.841 --> 17:00.481
No lawyer required.
- Life at stake.

17:00.521 --> 17:02.001
I haven't kidnapped anybody.

17:02.041 --> 17:04.721
So where's Natalie Yelburton?
- I want a lawyer.

17:04.761 --> 17:06.281
Forget about it.

17:07.041 --> 17:08.721
Where's Natalie, Vincent?

17:08.761 --> 17:11.041
She left and she went home to England.

17:12.161 --> 17:16.881
So who escaped out of the basement
leaving the empty handcuffs?

17:16.921 --> 17:18.881
No one escaped.

17:18.921 --> 17:23.601
That was... That was our...
consensual bondage love-making.

17:23.641 --> 17:26.681
Two consenting adults
in a sexual relationship

17:26.721 --> 17:28.961
involving sadomasochistic restraint

17:30.001 --> 17:34.361
domination, subservience,
a bit of...biting, nibbling.

17:34.401 --> 17:37.001
How did you get your nose broken?

17:37.041 --> 17:39.281
Er... in an incident
with a Russian trawlerman.

17:39.321 --> 17:41.281
We looked at that, that's bullshit.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.681
Didn't happen.
- Bullshit and nonsense.

17:43.721 --> 17:46.841
Natalie hit you.
- When she escaped.

17:46.881 --> 17:48.961
From her consensual bondage.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.841
No.

17:50.881 --> 17:55.321
Do you understand, Vincent,
we're now looking for a body?

17:55.361 --> 17:57.801
But we don't need a body
to charge you with murder.

17:57.841 --> 17:59.201
We can charge you without the body.

17:59.241 --> 18:00.961
There isn't a body
because nobody's been murdered.

18:02.201 --> 18:05.281
Cut this shit out now, Dan,
he's not a fucking murderer.

18:05.321 --> 18:08.121
No?
- How stupid are you all?

18:17.641 --> 18:18.641
Petra?

18:18.681 --> 18:21.441
I checked the passenger manifest
for the last week.

18:21.481 --> 18:23.601
Natalie Yelburton's name's not on them.

18:23.641 --> 18:26.521
Her passport isn't
in the emigration system either.

18:26.561 --> 18:28.041
She never left Fortitude.

18:29.561 --> 18:33.521
Get over to Vincent's house...
and help Ingrid out.

18:35.161 --> 18:37.401
Look. Look, listen to me, please.

18:37.441 --> 18:39.841
She... She was in the basement.

18:39.881 --> 18:42.721
And now she's got out
and I don't know how because she's blind.

18:42.761 --> 18:44.881
I don't know.
She can't have got anywhere on her own

18:44.921 --> 18:45.881
so somebody must have taken her.

18:45.921 --> 18:47.841
You have to find her
because she's not well.

18:47.881 --> 18:50.761
- Ask him about the parasite.
- Did you drug her?

18:50.801 --> 18:52.801
No, I didn't.

18:53.561 --> 18:55.161
Who... Who's she?

19:00.281 --> 19:02.281
Who the fuck is that?

19:05.481 --> 19:06.601
Hey!

19:13.521 --> 19:16.361
Get out of here.
- Sit down.

19:16.401 --> 19:19.881
I'm in the middle of a fuckin'
murder interview, so y...

19:21.721 --> 19:24.601
Just sit down.

19:26.961 --> 19:29.041
Ask him about the parasite.

19:30.441 --> 19:32.241
Dan.

19:32.281 --> 19:34.641
Why was she restrained in the basement?

19:34.681 --> 19:36.601
Maybe she's infected.

19:36.641 --> 19:38.081
Infected?

19:38.121 --> 19:41.081
What if Natalie
is becoming like you now, Dan?

19:41.121 --> 19:43.401
What do you do about that?

19:46.921 --> 19:48.441
I don't know.

19:48.481 --> 19:52.521
Do you find her, help her,
rescue her, Dan?

19:56.241 --> 19:57.641
Hm...

19:58.601 --> 20:00.081
Dan...

20:00.121 --> 20:01.641
Are you OK?

20:09.121 --> 20:11.201
Did Natalie have a parasite inside her?

20:11.241 --> 20:13.041
What?

20:13.081 --> 20:15.681
Did Natalie have...

20:17.001 --> 20:18.921
...a parasite...

20:21.041 --> 20:22.401
...inside her?

20:22.441 --> 20:24.681
Wh... What's that for?

20:29.921 --> 20:32.521
DCI Ingeborg Myklebust.

20:34.601 --> 20:35.841
Deceased.

20:38.441 --> 20:42.161
She was the Oslo divisional small-arms
champion the last three years.

20:42.201 --> 20:45.521
Then she broke her wrist making
an arrest in a bar in Holmenkollen.

20:45.561 --> 20:46.921
Compound fracture.

20:46.961 --> 20:48.961
Couldn't even hold the gun.

20:50.561 --> 20:53.761
She trained herself to shoot
with her left hand. Nine months.

20:53.801 --> 20:57.281
On the range every evening. Look.

21:02.281 --> 21:04.201
That's from Myklebust's dead body.

21:04.241 --> 21:06.521
It was in the evidence room
at the mortuary.

21:06.561 --> 21:08.281
Powder burns.

21:10.201 --> 21:12.561
This glove is from a right hand.

21:12.601 --> 21:14.121
Yes.

21:14.161 --> 21:15.921
Her broken wrist.

21:17.321 --> 21:18.481
Yes.

21:19.241 --> 21:21.921
And what's your connection
to DCI Myklebust?

21:24.721 --> 21:26.721
We spoke most evenings.

21:28.361 --> 21:30.601
She kept me up-to-date
with this investigation.

21:30.641 --> 21:32.961
I'm a forensic pathologist.

21:34.441 --> 21:37.081
You were the only one here
she trusted, Eric.

21:38.241 --> 21:40.761
The murders of Governor Erling Munk

21:40.801 --> 21:47.641
Elena Ledesma, Vladek Klimov
were all the responsibility of your sheriff.

21:54.961 --> 21:56.961
That wasn't a shoot-out.

22:01.681 --> 22:05.561
It was a triple execution
at Lars's cabin.

22:06.241 --> 22:09.521
Last night Ingeborg's body
was taken from the mortuary.

22:09.561 --> 22:11.721
I think it was Dan Anderssen
who took her.

22:11.761 --> 22:13.441
Why would he take her body?

22:13.481 --> 22:14.881
I think...

22:17.921 --> 22:20.161
I think he is completely mad.

22:28.641 --> 22:30.401
Why are you in the dark?

22:31.761 --> 22:34.281
I've identified semen staining
all over this sofa.

22:34.321 --> 22:37.001
That's completely irrelevant
to the investigation.

22:37.041 --> 22:39.681
It is not irrelevant
to the investigation.

22:39.721 --> 22:42.641
It is completely relevant
to the investigation.

22:42.681 --> 22:44.321
No, it's not.

22:44.361 --> 22:46.361
How the fuck do you...?

22:47.761 --> 22:49.681
Oh.
- Torch clicks

22:53.401 --> 22:55.401
Maybe we should move on
into the kitchen.

22:55.441 --> 22:56.761
Yeah.

23:01.241 --> 23:03.841
He told me the blood in the kitchen
was all reindeer.

23:05.361 --> 23:10.241
And then we made love and all the time
Natalie was still in the basement.

23:15.441 --> 23:16.681
What do you want?

23:17.961 --> 23:20.161
- Hey, kiddo.
- Yeah dad, what is it?

23:20.201 --> 23:22.681
I just wondered where you were.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.321
There's stuff we need to talk about.

23:27.481 --> 23:29.601
We've just arrested Vincent Rattrey.

23:29.641 --> 23:31.281
Arrested?

23:33.001 --> 23:34.601
What did he do?

23:34.641 --> 23:36.841
Natalie's gone missing.
I have to go now.

23:38.681 --> 23:41.681
No, that's OK,
I'll see you back at the house.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.281
Yeah.

23:44.081 --> 23:45.361
Bye.

25:17.001 --> 25:19.441
Mulvihill said you can't get drunk.

25:21.681 --> 25:23.361
I can't.

25:23.401 --> 25:24.961
Yeah.

25:26.321 --> 25:28.121
I used to be like that.

25:32.561 --> 25:34.561
Now you don't have to drink any more.

25:38.361 --> 25:40.161
No?
- No.

25:44.601 --> 25:46.241
You have me.

26:02.761 --> 26:06.161
Time is running away from me
faster and faster.

26:09.601 --> 26:11.601
I'm running with ya.

26:30.601 --> 26:32.121
Markus.

26:32.161 --> 26:36.481
Time you and me had this thing out
once and for all!

26:40.761 --> 26:41.961
Holy fuck.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.681
He's not in his office.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.721
He's not answering his cellphone.

27:20.601 --> 27:22.801
There's fresh blood
on the blade of this knife.

27:22.841 --> 27:25.001
Oh, shit.

27:25.041 --> 27:27.641
The young man's a murder suspect?

27:28.521 --> 27:30.521
Dan shouldn't have
taken him out of custody.

27:30.561 --> 27:32.041
Is that him?
- It's the Governor.

27:33.001 --> 27:34.601
Governor Husekleppe?

27:36.681 --> 27:38.601
Who is this?

27:38.641 --> 27:39.921
Ralfi?

27:40.761 --> 27:43.361
Wad up a towel
and hold it tight against the wound

27:43.401 --> 27:45.361
as much pressure as you can.

27:45.401 --> 27:46.921
Come on!

27:54.521 --> 27:55.921
Gentlemen.

27:57.441 --> 27:59.041
Can we buy our sheriff a drink?

28:00.841 --> 28:03.601
We're drinking to the memory
of Lars Ulvinaune.

28:04.521 --> 28:08.241
A great snow-plough driver
and the nicest man in Fortitude.

28:08.281 --> 28:09.201
Hm.

28:09.241 --> 28:12.241
Before he became
a murdering killer, obviously.

28:12.281 --> 28:13.361
Hmph.

28:14.001 --> 28:16.001
Lars didn't murder anybody.

28:17.361 --> 28:20.161
I throttled Lars
and then I shot him through the throat.

28:27.801 --> 28:29.801
There you go.

28:32.761 --> 28:34.761
To Lars Ulvinaune.

28:36.041 --> 28:37.761
The nicest man in Fortitude.

28:38.401 --> 28:40.401
- To Lars Ulvinaune!
- Lars.

28:44.361 --> 28:47.121
The woman I spoke to yesterday.
- Elsa.

28:47.161 --> 28:49.521
Hmm. Where does she live?

28:53.921 --> 28:56.161
How is he?
- He's alive.

28:56.201 --> 28:58.961
He said anything?
- Nothing intelligible.

28:59.001 --> 29:00.681
He wants to speak.

29:00.721 --> 29:03.601
He needs oxygen.
- No, no. Dan!

29:03.641 --> 29:08.241
I found him. I placed a bag of frozen
<i>petit pois</i> on top of it

29:08.281 --> 29:10.761
in case they wanted to sew it all back on.

29:27.321 --> 29:28.961
There's no food!

29:29.001 --> 29:30.641
Nothing to eat.

29:31.761 --> 29:33.761
There's never anything.

29:35.921 --> 29:37.921
Who are you?

29:38.721 --> 29:41.361
Your dad didn't tell me
you were a police officer.

29:41.401 --> 29:42.921
What?

29:43.601 --> 29:45.561
I wouldn't have guessed.

29:47.241 --> 29:48.561
Hey!

29:48.601 --> 29:50.561
Hey, you!

29:50.601 --> 29:52.721
Hey. Hey, kiddo.

29:52.761 --> 29:54.241
Dad? Who the fuck is that?

29:57.841 --> 29:59.601
Er... her name is Elsa.

29:59.641 --> 30:03.041
And I am helping her out
with some stuff.

30:03.081 --> 30:04.521
Why was she upstairs with you?

30:06.001 --> 30:08.121
Come on, Ingrid...

30:10.241 --> 30:11.721
Oh...

30:11.761 --> 30:14.321
Were you having sex with her?
- Ingrid.

30:14.361 --> 30:16.001
In our house?
- Ingrid.

30:16.041 --> 30:17.401
Upstairs?

30:17.441 --> 30:19.601
In my mum's bed?
- Come on, honey.

30:19.641 --> 30:21.721
Were you with that woman
in my mum's bed?

30:21.761 --> 30:26.881
She is in trouble and I am just trying
to help her out, that's all.

30:26.921 --> 30:28.921
Mum was in trouble.

30:32.681 --> 30:34.041
She was in...
- Yes, I know.

30:34.081 --> 30:36.081
...so much trouble.

30:37.321 --> 30:39.881
Shrinking... and shrivelling...
- Yes.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.601
...every day.
- Yes.

30:41.641 --> 30:43.961
Getting smaller and weaker...
- Yes.

30:44.521 --> 30:47.521
...and less and less of her
being in the room with us.

30:47.561 --> 30:49.161
Yes.

30:49.201 --> 30:50.841
Hey, honey, I know.

30:53.921 --> 30:55.921
And I couldn't do anything.

30:57.521 --> 30:59.881
None of us.
- I know.

31:01.361 --> 31:04.041
I know.

31:04.081 --> 31:05.481
And you didn't do anything!

31:12.281 --> 31:13.681
I know, kiddo.

31:13.721 --> 31:15.721
Don't call me that!

31:16.601 --> 31:19.041
You are not my father!

31:20.321 --> 31:22.321
Ingrid. Ingrid...

31:23.561 --> 31:25.561
I want you to leave!

31:38.121 --> 31:39.561
Get out!

32:51.441 --> 32:53.601
No... No...

32:54.481 --> 32:56.481
No...

32:57.521 --> 32:58.681
Dad!

33:00.121 --> 33:03.361
Dr Khatri described
what's happening to me

33:03.401 --> 33:06.681
as "scorbutic liquefaction".

33:07.881 --> 33:09.401
Wow.

33:09.441 --> 33:11.441
What the hell is that?

33:12.961 --> 33:18.961
When the body's connective materials
begin to fail at a cellular level.

33:19.001 --> 33:23.241
The scorbutic liquefaction
will involve profound lethargy

33:23.281 --> 33:26.721
internal and external bleeding

33:26.761 --> 33:32.081
followed by the rapid disintegration
of different tissue layers and organs.

33:33.121 --> 33:37.481
All this accompanied
by the collapse of cognitive faculties

33:37.521 --> 33:39.401
as the brain turns to mush.

33:41.401 --> 33:44.481
Jesus, Elsa, is there something
we can do about this?

33:46.081 --> 33:52.081
The procedures I've employed so far will
become less and less effective and...

33:54.161 --> 33:55.961
...I'll require more donors.

33:58.641 --> 34:00.601
Donors.

34:00.641 --> 34:02.641
Like Mulvihill?

34:03.441 --> 34:04.961
Yes.

34:06.841 --> 34:08.481
The blind girl.

34:12.961 --> 34:15.601
Natalie.
- Mm-hm.

34:17.041 --> 34:23.281
A transfusion from someone who already
hosts the parasite might be definitive.

34:24.841 --> 34:26.841
You mean a cure?

34:28.081 --> 34:29.121
Yes.

34:32.761 --> 34:34.281
Yes, a cure.

34:38.761 --> 34:39.921
I see.

34:56.441 --> 34:58.281
Hey, Dan!

34:58.321 --> 34:59.881
It's Eric.

35:01.841 --> 35:03.601
You in there?

35:04.801 --> 35:05.961
Dan?

35:20.841 --> 35:22.401
Show yourself!

35:26.321 --> 35:29.521
He's not here.

35:52.001 --> 35:54.001
You let this happen.

35:54.041 --> 35:56.481
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

35:58.361 --> 35:59.881
You were here.

36:01.281 --> 36:03.041
You know this man.

36:04.361 --> 36:05.441
Jesus!

36:07.041 --> 36:09.401
That smell. Jesus!
- Bodies.

36:13.001 --> 36:15.001
You hear that?

36:26.201 --> 36:28.201
Euch!

36:31.121 --> 36:32.401
Jesus.

36:34.161 --> 36:35.801
Now!

36:39.121 --> 36:41.841
I'll get the ambulance.
- It's OK.

36:44.121 --> 36:47.961
I need an ambulance. The Sheriff's
house. I don't know the address.

36:48.001 --> 36:50.001
Who are you?

36:50.041 --> 36:51.921
I'm from Oslo.
- Oslo?

36:51.961 --> 36:54.121
Yes. I'm with her.

36:55.281 --> 36:58.201
Detective Chief Inspector
Ingeborg Myklebust.

36:58.241 --> 37:01.121
Dan Anderssen murdered her.
- You are breaking and entering.

37:01.161 --> 37:03.161
What are you gonna do?

37:04.001 --> 37:06.081
Are you gonna shoot me, Petra?

37:06.881 --> 37:08.321
Petra!

37:08.361 --> 37:09.921
Get in here!

37:32.721 --> 37:34.521
Help me with him! His heart's stopped.

37:34.561 --> 37:37.361
When I say, pinch his nose
and blow into his lungs...

37:45.641 --> 37:47.001
Natalie?

37:47.881 --> 37:49.721
Natalie Yelburton?

37:57.841 --> 37:59.001
Natalie?

38:04.281 --> 38:05.801
Hey, Natalie!

38:17.201 --> 38:19.401
Where is she?

38:19.441 --> 38:21.601
Well, I'd probably look in the garage.

38:26.361 --> 38:27.361
You know my heart's stopped?

38:28.801 --> 38:32.481
Mm-hm. They're trying to re-start it
right now, in the ambulance.

38:32.521 --> 38:34.001
Good.

38:34.041 --> 38:36.801
But my brain's been starved of oxygen
for 15 minutes.

38:36.841 --> 38:39.721
So I might be...
- Vincent, I don't have time

38:39.761 --> 38:41.761
to listen to your whining.

38:43.281 --> 38:44.681
Natalie?

38:44.721 --> 38:47.121
I might be intellectually compromised.

38:52.761 --> 38:55.081
Natalie.

38:59.001 --> 39:01.001
It's OK, it's OK.

39:01.041 --> 39:02.521
Shh, it's OK, it's OK.

39:03.281 --> 39:04.961
Oh! Oh, God!

39:06.081 --> 39:08.121
Thank you. Please...

39:08.161 --> 39:10.841
Please get this stuff off me!
- It's OK, it's OK.

39:10.881 --> 39:13.361
- Please?
- Keep still. You're safe now.

39:16.641 --> 39:18.641
Please take my bandages off.

39:31.121 --> 39:32.561
Hey.

39:34.881 --> 39:37.441
Sheriff?
- I found you.

39:38.281 --> 39:40.281
You found me.

39:41.321 --> 39:43.321
Oh, God... I can't...

39:43.841 --> 39:45.881
I can't believe...

39:45.921 --> 39:47.281
Dan...

39:49.281 --> 39:51.041
...I can see.

39:52.201 --> 39:54.081
I can see.

39:56.641 --> 39:57.881
Oh!

40:00.761 --> 40:04.481
I never believed that this madness
could possibly...

40:07.041 --> 40:08.441
Hey.

40:29.001 --> 40:30.761
Where are we?

40:34.161 --> 40:36.281
We're at the airport.
- No.

40:37.681 --> 40:39.961
What? Michael... Michael...

40:42.521 --> 40:43.601
Michael?

40:46.441 --> 40:47.521
No...

40:51.721 --> 40:53.201
Hello.

40:53.241 --> 40:54.801
Ingrid.

40:54.841 --> 40:57.201
Hi.

40:58.161 --> 40:59.841
The girl you're looking for.

41:01.121 --> 41:05.201
Natalie Yelburton...
- I can't wait a lot longer, Michael.

41:05.241 --> 41:07.961
She's at the rental house on the fjord.

41:08.001 --> 41:09.401
No.

41:12.361 --> 41:13.841
Dad, where are you?

41:13.881 --> 41:15.361
Never mind that.

41:17.721 --> 41:19.121
Ingrid...

41:21.481 --> 41:25.641
I can't stay here any longer.
I can't live like this.

41:25.681 --> 41:27.681
I'm no good here anymore.

41:29.881 --> 41:31.481
I love you, kiddo.

41:34.921 --> 41:36.401
Bye-bye, baby.

41:37.321 --> 41:39.321
Bye. Bye.

41:41.321 --> 41:42.961
I love you.

41:44.201 --> 41:46.201
I love you too.

41:48.441 --> 41:49.681
Michael.

42:00.201 --> 42:03.081
Michael, listen to me. Listen to me.

42:03.121 --> 42:06.561
We need to go back to the house
cos I don't have much longer.

42:06.601 --> 42:09.441
I'm not gonna let you die alone.
- My strength is...

42:09.481 --> 42:11.601
We need to get the girl, honey.

42:11.641 --> 42:13.841
There's a hospice. It's in Bergen.

42:15.241 --> 42:16.921
I'll take you there.

42:18.441 --> 42:23.281
I'll stay with you until the end, Elsa.

42:24.361 --> 42:26.121
No, Michael...

42:27.241 --> 42:29.521
I'll stay with you.
- No...

42:30.521 --> 42:32.481
...until it's over.

42:32.521 --> 42:34.321
I can...

42:46.881 --> 42:48.881
Ingrid, Petra, you check the house.

43:04.681 --> 43:06.241
Get off him!

43:14.801 --> 43:16.961
No!

43:21.841 --> 43:23.361
Call an ambulance!

43:36.121 --> 43:37.601
Is he going to make it?

43:37.641 --> 43:41.601
Eric, there's so much blood loss,
so much damage...

43:57.641 --> 43:59.121
Teeny lights.

44:01.401 --> 44:03.401
At the back of your eyes.

44:05.121 --> 44:06.641
In outer space.

44:16.281 --> 44:19.321
All your teeny little lights
going out now, Dan.

44:21.561 --> 44:23.561
My sheriff.

44:25.761 --> 44:29.121
One, by one, by one.

44:49.641 --> 44:51.321
Hildur?

45:07.081 --> 45:09.721
I've been waiting for this, you fucker.

45:11.761 --> 45:13.721
I've been waiting for you.

45:23.641 --> 45:26.321
Yagh!

45:26.361 --> 45:27.721
Come on!

45:30.681 --> 45:34.401
Thing is, Sheriff.
Thing you probably fucking knew...

45:35.641 --> 45:37.041
Argh!

45:38.001 --> 45:39.361
Argh!

45:39.401 --> 45:43.401
When you're eaten alive
by one of these monsters...

45:43.441 --> 45:45.321
Agh!

45:50.081 --> 45:53.121
...it's like it never fucking stops.

45:56.961 --> 46:02.521
It takes longer than all the fucking
life you lived before it started!

46:46.361 --> 46:48.081
The shamans tell us

46:48.121 --> 46:51.521
you can't cross over
into the land of the dead on your own.

46:52.201 --> 46:56.561
Someone who loves you
has to come and get you.

46:57.361 --> 46:59.961
Lead you from the land of the living.

47:00.001 --> 47:02.441
Your mother. Your lover.

47:02.481 --> 47:05.321
Your oldest, dearest friend.

47:07.801 --> 47:09.921
But there's only you.

47:12.401 --> 47:14.041
There's no one, Dan.

47:24.001 --> 47:25.321
Henry.

47:27.121 --> 47:28.721
Henry!

47:30.121 --> 47:31.401
Henry!

47:32.881 --> 47:34.641
Agh!

48:02.081 --> 48:04.081
Is everything alright?

48:04.921 --> 48:07.601
Everything's fine. Thanks.

48:15.841 --> 48:17.001
Elsa?

48:24.921 --> 48:26.281
All good.

48:30.201 --> 48:31.401
Hmm...
