00:00.801 --> 00:03.969
- ♪

00:03.971 --> 00:06.171
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:07.508 --> 00:12.077
Do you remember where
we were at this time,

00:12.079 --> 00:14.613
on this day 20 years ago?

00:14.615 --> 00:16.582
- Eww! Come on,
there's young ears around.

00:16.584 --> 00:20.753
- Why would you even have
that conversation around us?

00:20.755 --> 00:26.058
- We weren't doing that.
Your dad was proposing to me.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.661
- Dad, you proposed to Mom at
8:00 AM with sleep in her eye,

00:29.663 --> 00:31.630
looking a hot mess?

00:32.566 --> 00:36.402
Come on, Dad,
that's a rookie maneuver!

00:36.404 --> 00:38.070
- Your mom never
looks a hot mess.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.471
Look at her.

00:39.473 --> 00:43.142
Now, a lukewarm mess,
yeah, that's very often.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.710
I had planned on
proposing at dinner,

00:44.712 --> 00:47.513
but I was just too excited.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.348
- You must've really been
in love with Mom, huh, Dad?

00:49.350 --> 00:53.085
- Yeah, yeah, a long time ago.
I actually loved her.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.988
- That's so romantic.
- It was.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.589
Your daddy was so cute.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.692
- So what did you think?
Was it a good proposal?

01:00.694 --> 01:03.095
- Absolutely not.

01:03.097 --> 01:06.365
He, like, took the
ring out of the box and...

01:06.367 --> 01:09.234
"So what do you
think about that?"

01:09.236 --> 01:11.303
- I thought it was
real player like.

01:14.475 --> 01:18.243
- What woman wants their husband
talking about being a player?

01:18.245 --> 01:20.245
- After a guy spends a
lot of money on a ring,

01:20.247 --> 01:22.881
why are there rules on
how he should deliver it

01:22.883 --> 01:25.084
after he spent thousand...

01:25.086 --> 01:28.487
hundreds of dollars on it?
Ooh, shade.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.155
- Because some thought
should go into it.

01:30.157 --> 01:34.126
You have so much to
learn about women.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.327
- I thought you
was gonna be happy.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.762
I know you wanted to get married

01:36.764 --> 01:38.697
and it took every penny I had
to buy that ring.

01:38.699 --> 01:43.135
- Mm, yeah, we did have to
eat a lot of ramen noodles

01:43.137 --> 01:44.770
after you bought this ring.

01:44.772 --> 01:48.440
- Roughing it, baby.
Young and in love, mm!

01:48.442 --> 01:49.942
- Yeah, I'm never doing that.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.376
- How was the wedding, Mom?

01:51.378 --> 01:54.179
- Yeah, we went to the
justice of the peace.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.215
I didn't have a dress.

01:56.217 --> 01:59.918
There was no family
there, no friends.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.687
- We just had each other
and that's all we needed.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.922
- We were so broke,
our rehearsal dinner

02:03.924 --> 02:05.791
was hamburgers at Four Guys.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.494
- Dang, Dad, you couldn't
afford the extra guy?

02:08.496 --> 02:13.332
- I know. But now we can.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.533
[sighs]
And that's why...

02:16.704 --> 02:18.670
- Oh my god. Dad!

02:18.672 --> 02:22.341
- We're gonna do
it right this time.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.143
- What are you doing?

02:24.145 --> 02:25.711
- Leah Renee Washington?

02:25.713 --> 02:26.812
- Mm-hmm, that's me.

02:26.814 --> 02:30.015
- Will you marry me again?

02:30.017 --> 02:31.750
- What are you
talking about, boy?

02:31.752 --> 02:35.420
- I'm talking about us being
like Martin and Coretta.

02:35.422 --> 02:38.023
Renewing our vows.
What you say?

02:38.025 --> 02:40.859
- Oh, that's a great idea, baby!

02:40.861 --> 02:43.662
Like this time with a dress,
with family, friends.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.665
- Mm-hmm.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.734
And something a little
bit better than burgers.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.169
What do you say?

02:50.171 --> 02:52.137
- [squeals]
I do, I do, I do!

02:52.139 --> 02:56.275
Of course I do! Oh, baby!

02:56.277 --> 02:58.343
Okay, I'm going
to tell everybody.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.546
- Okay. Ask them if
they can help us pitch in.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.681
- LEAH: Okay!
- Put it all together.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.883
- So Dad, uh, when you were
saying you wanted to be more

03:04.885 --> 03:10.022
like Michael and Loretta,
who was that again?

03:10.024 --> 03:11.623
- I said Martin and Coretta.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.092
Martin Luther King
and his wife, Coretta?

03:14.094 --> 03:15.961
- Oh.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.497
- Boy, stop playing.
- Oh, he's not playing, Dad.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.399
You have so much to
teach your youngest son.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.902
- How you know I got other kids?

03:23.904 --> 03:27.573
- You do?
- Nah, nah, I'm just kidding.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.441
- All right, yeah, man,
I was just playing.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.710
I knew that, I knew that.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.812
- You know who Rosa
Parks is, right?

03:33.814 --> 03:39.117
- She the one who...
put the roses in the parks.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.352
- Harriet Tubman?

03:40.354 --> 03:43.555
- She invented the
hot tub, Dad, come on.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.224
- George Washington Carver?

03:45.226 --> 03:47.759
- George Washington Carver.

03:47.761 --> 03:51.430
What, George Washington
Carv--Carv--Carver, okay.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.632
He carved the--the statue...

03:56.537 --> 03:58.237
- Congratulations, Philip.

03:58.239 --> 04:01.640
You just earned yourself a
nice Black history class today.

surfing the internet when

04:26.100 --> 04:27.766
everybody's running around,

04:27.768 --> 04:30.535
preparing for tomorrow's
ceremony?

04:30.537 --> 04:34.373
- My dad's making me
read up on Black history.

04:34.375 --> 04:37.009
- That does not look
like Black history.

04:37.011 --> 04:39.277
It looks like a woman who's
suffering from hypothermia

04:39.279 --> 04:41.346
'cause she can't stop shaking.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.482
- It's called twerking.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.318
I honestly didn't
know where to start,

04:46.320 --> 04:47.719
so I'm watching a music video.

04:47.721 --> 04:51.323
- Black history began
the way human history began:

04:51.325 --> 04:55.160
Africa, for we are
the world's first people.

04:55.162 --> 04:57.562
We built great kingdoms
like Axum

04:57.564 --> 05:00.332
and amazing cities like
Timbuktu.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.167
- I never learned
that in school.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.236
- That is because they don't
want you to know about your

05:04.238 --> 05:05.537
powerful history.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.775
I'll have to leave you
to your research.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.444
I have to drive to the
florist to order some flowers.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.013
- You know you can just
order them online, right?

05:15.015 --> 05:17.082
- Oh yes, but online
you don't get to meet

05:17.084 --> 05:19.151
the person behind the counter.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.519
And you may never know,

05:20.521 --> 05:23.355
it could be an older woman
with an apple bottom

05:23.357 --> 05:26.425
with a thing for
sexy Black African men.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.993
- I like your style!

05:27.995 --> 05:29.461
- BOTH: [laughing]

05:29.463 --> 05:31.730
- We Black people,
we're a hopeful people.

05:34.635 --> 05:39.438
- Young man, I'm off to get
the cake, but I had to ask.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.674
Do you really not know
who Rosa Parks is?

05:42.676 --> 05:43.909
- I've heard the name.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.777
- But you must
remember the deeds,

05:45.779 --> 05:49.648
hers and those other heroes like
Tubman, and Truth, and Douglass,

05:49.650 --> 05:53.218
and DuBois, and Martin,
and Malcolm, and Medgar,

05:53.220 --> 05:55.320
and--and those countless other

05:55.322 --> 05:57.456
brothers and sisters
through time

05:57.458 --> 06:01.893
who fought for our
equality, our rights,

06:01.895 --> 06:04.830
and our humanity.

06:04.832 --> 06:08.333
Now...

06:08.335 --> 06:11.236
Where was I going?

06:11.238 --> 06:12.437
- To go pick up the cake.

06:12.439 --> 06:14.773
- Yes, I almost forgot.

06:18.412 --> 06:22.581
- Philip, darling.
I know you're studying,

06:22.583 --> 06:26.017
but I didn't want you to
forget about our entertainers.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.086
- Oh, like the
singers and comedians.

06:28.088 --> 06:31.523
- Yes, like the sports
stars, the dancers,

06:31.525 --> 06:33.625
the actors like Ossie Davis.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.594
You know, we were on
Broadway together.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.830
He starred in
"A Raisin in the Sun"

06:38.832 --> 06:43.468
and I starred in
"A Chitlin on the Moon."

06:43.470 --> 06:45.070
- That play was on Broadway?

06:45.072 --> 06:46.638
- Broadway adjacent.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.473
But anyway, in Black history

06:48.475 --> 06:53.545
there are more than performers
and creators.

06:53.547 --> 06:56.648
There are scientists and
inventors that found a way

06:56.650 --> 07:00.352
to shine in spite of those
that were hell bent on

07:00.354 --> 07:02.554
snuffing out their light.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.122
- Who wants to
snuff out our light?

07:04.124 --> 07:05.690
- Don't worry about it, darling,

07:05.692 --> 07:08.560
because our light is
so bright and fabulous

07:08.562 --> 07:13.265
that no one will
ever be able to put it out.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.566
Speaking of fabulous,

07:14.568 --> 07:18.069
I have to go and buy
my dress for tomorrow.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.938
- You have millions of
dresses in your closet.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.475
- Oh darling,
they're all couture.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.944
My mother told me...
- [Doorbell rings]

07:25.946 --> 07:28.180
- ...it would be a sin
to outshine the bride.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.784
- Yo!
- LINDOR: What's up, brah?

07:36.123 --> 07:39.691
So, I heard you've been
learning about Black history.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.427
- Yeah, and it's
cool and everything.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.930
Trust me, I appreciate and
respect the people that came

07:44.932 --> 07:46.731
before me and all the
things they did, but--

07:46.733 --> 07:49.668
- It feels like
ancient history, right?

07:49.670 --> 07:51.002
I feel you, bro.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.305
Like, as important as
Black history is to know,

07:53.307 --> 07:55.440
it just doesn't feel super
relevant for our generation,

07:55.442 --> 07:56.842
you know?
- Right.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.743
Like, like, like trust me,
I think it's dope that--

07:58.745 --> 08:01.379
that they built a huge empire
2,000 years ago--

08:01.381 --> 08:03.582
- But we're tired of being
followed around in a mall

08:03.584 --> 08:05.517
like we stole something
right now, today.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.085
- Exactly! Like, like,

08:07.087 --> 08:10.422
I don't want that soggy lasagna
from that janky food court.

08:10.424 --> 08:13.191
- Sounds like you wanna learn
about some modern Black history.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.326
- Yeah, no cap.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.727
- Okay, but I can
do you one better.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.429
We can make some modern-day
Black history right now.

08:17.431 --> 08:18.964
- How?

08:18.966 --> 08:20.866
- There's a rally
downtown, all right?

08:20.868 --> 08:22.534
We can show up
for our community

08:22.536 --> 08:25.537
and--and--and protest
police brutality.

08:25.539 --> 08:26.538
- Bet. Let's do it!

08:26.540 --> 08:28.073
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.476
- Ah! Okay.

08:31.478 --> 08:35.814
[clears throat]
The cake is ordered.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.616
The flowers are taken care of.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.618
The food is set.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.020
And I got my dress.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.255
Mm-hmm.

08:45.592 --> 08:48.159
- [chuckles]

08:48.161 --> 08:50.996
- Instead of worrying about
whatever is in your phone,

08:50.998 --> 08:53.598
you should be worried about
the ceremony tomorrow, Jeremy.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.068
- Baby, I've been ready.
Come on, now. Stop it.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.071
- Okay, you weren't
ready 20 years ago.

09:00.073 --> 09:04.209
- I married you, didn't I?
- Finally.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.077
- Sorry, are we
interrupting anything?

09:06.079 --> 09:08.747
- Oh no, we was just--
we was talking.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.715
- Oh. Okay, you know what?

09:10.717 --> 09:12.918
We just wanted to stop by
to make sure everything is

09:12.920 --> 09:15.687
in order for the big day
tomorrow.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.622
- Slowly but surely.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.090
- All right.
- Oh, good.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.760
- You know what?
I also--I got my dress.

09:21.762 --> 09:22.894
And I just wanted
to thank you

09:22.896 --> 09:25.030
for making me
your maid of honor.

09:25.032 --> 09:28.266
I mean, you know what?
The honor is all mine.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.402
I'm so happy for you guys.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.070
- Thank you, Cora.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.372
- And I'm honored that y'all let
me be the main preacher at y'all

09:34.374 --> 09:36.441
little do-over wedding, yeah?

09:36.443 --> 09:38.643
Hey, tell me--tell me how
y'all want this to go down.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.378
Tell me what you want me to do.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.247
- Well, what are our options?

09:42.249 --> 09:43.481
- Okay, uh, let me see.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.650
I got the Prince package,
'cause I work in packages.

09:45.652 --> 09:48.586
- The Prince package?
- Oh!

09:48.588 --> 09:50.755
- What's the Prince package?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.991
- That's where I drive
in a little red Corvette

09:52.993 --> 09:54.159
wearing a raspberry beret

09:54.161 --> 09:57.729
and I let the doves go
and make 'em cry.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.898
- That sounds like a
PETA violation to me.

09:59.900 --> 10:00.999
- What else you got?

10:01.001 --> 10:03.168
- I got the Michael package.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.570
Yeah, the Michael package,
I come in in Billie Jeans

10:05.572 --> 10:07.339
and I do really, really
bad stuff

10:07.341 --> 10:10.008
until y'all get mad and
y'all just tell me, beat it.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.112
- All your packages
sound bad, Mr. Brown.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.580
- You wanna be
starting something?

10:15.582 --> 10:17.816
Hm? Hm?
- JEREMY: Mister Brown?

10:17.818 --> 10:20.518
You don't have,
like, a normal, simple,

10:20.520 --> 10:22.320
everyday ceremony
where, you know,

10:22.322 --> 10:25.390
you come in with the "Dearly
beloved" and then, you know,

10:25.392 --> 10:30.595
we exchange vows, woompty-woomp,
then, you may kiss the bride,

10:30.597 --> 10:31.997
push through, that's it?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.531
- You aren't playing.
- JEREMY: Keep it pushing.

10:33.533 --> 10:36.267
- Woompty-woomp,
keep it pushing?

10:36.269 --> 10:37.469
That's not something
you would say

10:37.471 --> 10:39.104
if you were into this, Jeremy.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.805
- What do you mean
if I was into this?

10:40.807 --> 10:42.273
This was my idea.
I'm the one that planned this.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.976
- It was your idea because
you messed up the first time

10:44.978 --> 10:47.512
and I practically had
to drag you down the altar.

10:47.514 --> 10:50.849
- Shut up, she had to drag you?
You didn't wanna be there?

10:50.851 --> 10:52.684
- Mr. Brown, get out of
these people's business.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.818
- --I do, Cora!

10:53.820 --> 10:55.387
- No, that's okay, Mr. Brown.

10:55.389 --> 10:58.790
The only reason we're together
is because I gave Mr. Jeremy,

10:58.792 --> 11:00.825
like, a series of ultimatums.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.527
- Really? Can you stop playing?

11:02.529 --> 11:04.963
That is not what happened.
- Oh.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.398
- That's not true.
You know that's not true.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.466
- Oh please, you just
wanted to play around

11:08.468 --> 11:09.834
with your little friends

11:09.836 --> 11:12.003
and go to all the clubs
until I finally gave you

11:12.005 --> 11:13.671
an ultimatum and told you

11:13.673 --> 11:15.874
that either we were
going to be serious

11:15.876 --> 11:18.743
or you can lose my number.

11:18.745 --> 11:20.145
- So you were trying to tell me

11:20.147 --> 11:22.881
Jeremy was a Santa Claus
in them streets?

11:22.883 --> 11:24.616
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Ho, ho, ho!

11:24.618 --> 11:26.151
- Mr. Brown!
You know what?

11:26.153 --> 11:28.686
Hey, guys,
we're gonna leave.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.155
- Nuh-uh, Cora, I'm
not gonna miss this.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.256
I wanna see this.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.358
Somebody gotta be a
witness, call the police.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.094
- And then, after
we made it official,

11:36.096 --> 11:38.897
he wanted to just
date for a few years,

11:38.899 --> 11:41.332
talking about we'll--
"We'll see what happens."

11:41.334 --> 11:45.136
- Nah, he didn't!
- Ha! Yes, he did.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.172
Mm, so I said,
"Either we move in together

11:47.174 --> 11:49.107
or I'mma move forward apart."

11:49.109 --> 11:51.709
Ha, ha, ha!
- Man, amen!

11:51.711 --> 11:53.912
- Just wait a minute.
Hold up, wait.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.246
You mean to tell me

11:55.248 --> 11:58.349
you took this sweet,
innocent little angel

11:58.351 --> 12:02.954
and you made a sinner
out of her?

12:02.956 --> 12:05.757
You know it said in the Word
that thou should not watcheth

12:05.759 --> 12:09.761
the movie and just chill.
You should marry.

12:09.763 --> 12:12.330
- And then I had to give him a
final ultimatum and told him

12:12.332 --> 12:14.699
if he was gonna just
keep dragging his feet,

12:14.701 --> 12:17.068
then I was done, done, done!

12:17.070 --> 12:19.237
- D-U-N, son, done!

12:19.239 --> 12:21.739
- You know what I'm done with?
- Oh, what you done with?

12:21.741 --> 12:22.807
- This conversation.

12:22.809 --> 12:23.875
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

12:23.877 --> 12:24.876
- That's right?
- That's right.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.311
- Mm!
- See look,

12:26.313 --> 12:28.913
we've been married
for 20 years, all right?

12:28.915 --> 12:30.648
We have two beautiful children.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.283
- That's a lie.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.052
- We have a wonderful
life together.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.654
And you still
living in the past.

12:36.656 --> 12:39.157
Stuff that you should've
been past by now.

12:39.159 --> 12:42.894
I mean, or at least
a sane person would.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.263
- Oh, and you don't never
play the crazy card with

12:45.265 --> 12:46.464
a Black woman, you know that.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.100
- He done played the
wrong card, playa.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.937
- So you're saying a sane
person should be past this, huh?

12:52.939 --> 12:55.740
Well, maybe we should be past

12:55.742 --> 12:59.344
this whole renew our vows
ceremony.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.513
- All right, whatever.
If that's what you wanna do.

13:01.515 --> 13:02.981
- Oh, okay.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.549
Mr. Brown, I've decided
what package we'll take.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.417
- What's that?

13:06.419 --> 13:08.853
- We're gonna take
the Empty package.

13:10.157 --> 13:15.360
'Cause there will not
be a ceremony tomorrow.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.494
- CORA: No, wait!

13:19.833 --> 13:24.669
- You don't ever, ever
call a Black woman crazy.

13:24.671 --> 13:25.970
You might as well
go take your dingus

13:25.972 --> 13:28.239
and throw it in the
garbage disposal, boy.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.343
- I didn't call her crazy.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.145
- You don't even imply
nothing like that.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.181
Man, I taught you
better than that!

13:36.183 --> 13:37.448
- Lay it on me, playa.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.651
- Okay, lesson number one.
Pay attention.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.953
Before you get
ready to make out,

13:41.955 --> 13:44.389
make sure they take their
dentures out, all right?

13:44.391 --> 13:47.992
I'm serious, man.
- That is disgusting.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.561
- VINNY: I know it is.
It happened to me, man.

13:49.563 --> 13:52.630
I'm trying to tongue wrestle
with Flat Booty Trudy, man,

13:52.632 --> 13:54.065
check this out.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.800
Her dentures fell out
of her mouth into my mouth.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.936
I almost--it's
unbelievable, man.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.837
- Look, man, I didn't come here

13:59.839 --> 14:01.806
to hear your tales
from the crypt, all right?

14:01.808 --> 14:03.541
I'm here to know if
I was right about Leah

14:03.543 --> 14:07.111
or she has a point
and I need to apologize.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.413
- Okay, lesson number two.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.914
Whenever you're having an
argument with your lady,

14:09.916 --> 14:11.282
you need to ask yourself,

14:11.284 --> 14:13.418
number one,
do you wanna be right,

14:13.420 --> 14:16.221
or number two,
do you wanna be together?

14:16.223 --> 14:17.822
- What do that even mean?

14:17.824 --> 14:19.724
- You concentrating so hard to
win the fight and she's gonna

14:19.726 --> 14:25.096
leave you, congratulations,
you done lost the war, dumbass.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.332
- So you're saying I should
apologize, basically.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.167
- Worked out for me
and Flat Booty Trudy.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.668
She called me up
the other day, said,

14:30.670 --> 14:32.937
"I'm sorry my dentures
fell out in your mouth."

14:32.939 --> 14:34.239
I'm like, "What?"

14:34.241 --> 14:36.708
"I'm sorry my dentures
fell out in your mouth."

14:36.710 --> 14:38.910
And now I'm hooking up with
her gummy ass next Tuesday.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.245
- Hello, Son, how was the march?

14:40.247 --> 14:42.180
- It was straight fire.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.148
I mean, thousands of people
came together

14:44.150 --> 14:46.217
to peacefully protest
police brutality.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.453
I mean, straight good vibes.
And then let me tell you--

14:48.455 --> 14:49.587
- Hold up, Philip, okay.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.422
You can tell your dad
about your march later on

14:51.424 --> 14:56.361
'cause your dad has
a march he needs to attend.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.295
- What march?

14:57.297 --> 14:58.730
- You need to march
your ass upstairs

14:58.732 --> 15:01.699
and apologize to your wife.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.402
- [sighs] All right, man.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.571
Hey, don't tell him those
stories about Big Booty Trudy,

15:06.573 --> 15:08.906
all right?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.942
- Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

15:10.944 --> 15:15.380
We are gathered here today for
this most suspicious occasion,

15:15.382 --> 15:20.652
to--to gather today
to join Jeremy...

15:20.654 --> 15:21.853
what's your middle name?

15:21.855 --> 15:23.321
- Delonte.
- Delonte.

15:23.323 --> 15:26.124
Jeremy De--you don't have
no apostrophes in there?

15:26.126 --> 15:27.292
- Just say it.
It don't--it don't matter.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.793
You can't pronounce
an apostrophe.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.194
Just say it.
- All right, all right.

15:30.196 --> 15:35.033
Jeremy Delonte without
no apostrophes Washington.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.134
We join him today with...

15:38.171 --> 15:40.905
We join him today with...

15:40.907 --> 15:43.141
Is she back there?

15:43.143 --> 15:45.209
We join him today--my freestyle,

15:45.211 --> 15:46.678
I don't have a
whole bunch of freestyle,

15:46.680 --> 15:47.812
so I just don't make--

15:49.883 --> 15:51.716
- Look everybody, uh...

15:51.718 --> 15:53.184
- Excuse me.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.352
- Leah's not here
yet, all right?

15:54.354 --> 15:56.854
And...I just wanna
take this time

15:56.856 --> 15:58.589
to let all my friends
and family know

15:58.591 --> 16:00.958
that I appreciate y'all

16:00.960 --> 16:03.895
and I've always loved
that woman.

16:03.897 --> 16:06.898
- ATTENDEES: Aww!

16:06.900 --> 16:08.533
- Yeah, yeah.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.536
I know Leah still feels some
type of way because, you know,

16:11.538 --> 16:13.604
I was a little laid back about
our relationship back then,

16:13.606 --> 16:17.075
but that did not mean
I didn't love her.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.810
I was laid back about
everything:

16:18.812 --> 16:21.546
school, work, you name it.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.682
I guess I was just a
little immature back then.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.217
- A little immature?

16:26.219 --> 16:28.553
Man, didn't y'all tell me he
put his tongue on a cold pole,

16:28.555 --> 16:30.421
and they had to call the
fire truck to get him off?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.025
- Okay, I was
extremely immature.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.227
But the point is...

16:36.229 --> 16:38.863
it may have took me some
nudging to put a ring on it.

16:38.865 --> 16:42.300
But I thank God every
single day for bringing me

16:42.302 --> 16:43.534
that strong Black woman

16:43.536 --> 16:46.270
and getting me to
where I need to be.

16:48.942 --> 16:51.142
- And you still have her.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.578
- ATTENDEES: Aww!

16:53.580 --> 16:56.547
- Where she belongs.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.817
By your side.

16:59.819 --> 17:00.752
- Baby.

17:02.455 --> 17:07.392
You are the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.193
And that's including the kids.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.465
If I can go back in time
and tell that teenager

17:14.467 --> 17:17.468
in that roller rink
what I know today...

17:17.470 --> 17:20.605
I'da proposed to you
right then and there.

17:24.110 --> 17:25.777
- I'm sorry I'm late.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.517
I thought a lot about our
conversation last night.

17:32.519 --> 17:37.522
[sighs] And how slow we were to
get to the altar the first time.

17:37.524 --> 17:41.759
- Mm-hmm.
- And then I realized

17:41.761 --> 17:46.197
that it never matters
how you get there.

17:46.199 --> 17:49.901
You can walk, you can drive,
you can take a train--

17:49.903 --> 17:51.335
- Take an electric scooter.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.137
I don't care how you get there.

17:53.139 --> 17:56.007
Just get there if you can.

17:56.009 --> 18:00.311
- An electric scooter.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.846
The how doesn't matter.

18:02.916 --> 18:08.886
The only thing that matters
is that you get home.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.322
And you're my home, Jeremy.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.925
- ATTENDEES: Aww!

18:15.161 --> 18:19.597
- Baby, you are my home.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.799
Wait, you thought
about this last night?

18:21.801 --> 18:24.802
- Uh-huh!
- Why you late?

18:24.804 --> 18:28.606
- I overslept. [giggles]

18:28.608 --> 18:32.143
- You got me talking to these
people I don't even like?

18:32.145 --> 18:34.812
- MR. BROWN: That was cold.
That's cold.

18:34.814 --> 18:40.751
- A woman with two kids, a job,
and a husband that snores

18:40.753 --> 18:43.521
doesn't play when she gets
an opportunity to sleep in.

18:44.491 --> 18:47.758
- Uh, uh, before y'all
put us both to sleep,

18:47.760 --> 18:50.862
I gotta get this rented
tuxedo back in a few minutes.

18:50.864 --> 18:52.597
Can y'all jump the
broom or sweep the mop,

18:52.599 --> 18:55.533
or whatever y'all want,
just so we can get it done.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.101
- Shoulda took it
back when you got it.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.569
- BOTH: [laughing]

18:58.571 --> 19:02.673
- You're looking
like a black fly.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.308
- BOTH: [laughing]

19:05.578 --> 19:07.578
- MR. BROWN: This is great?
This is great.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.852
- Okay. [clears throat]

19:14.854 --> 19:20.191
- Jumping the broom symbolizes
sweeping away the past.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.260
Are you ready for our future?

19:22.262 --> 19:24.262
- You know I am.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.531
- On three?
- On three?

19:26.533 --> 19:28.032
- On three?
- Okay.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.467
- BOTH: One, two, three.

19:29.469 --> 19:32.737
- [cheers and applause]

19:32.739 --> 19:36.474
- I now give to you
Jeremy and Leah Washington!

19:36.476 --> 19:37.909
- [cheers and applause]

19:40.146 --> 19:41.579
- How does my booty
look in this dress?

19:41.581 --> 19:43.447
