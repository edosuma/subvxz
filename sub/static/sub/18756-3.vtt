WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.970
(music thumping)

00:03.003 --> 00:05.139
- Dude, are you seeing this?

00:05.173 --> 00:08.042
Those babes are totally
vibing our bozacks.

00:08.076 --> 00:09.143
I'm gonna mack
the one on the right.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.411
You cool with the one
on the left?

00:10.444 --> 00:12.646
- Mike, I'm with Lucy.
- Who?

00:12.680 --> 00:15.015
- My girlfriend, Lucy.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.584
- Hi.
How you doing?

00:16.617 --> 00:18.252
- We... We're-we're dating.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.154
- Still?

00:20.188 --> 00:22.356
Josh, step into my office.
- (sighs) Ay.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.360
(regal music)

00:26.394 --> 00:27.661
- So what do you think
of my office?

00:27.695 --> 00:29.397
- It's a bit much.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.700
- Joshua, I have been
advising you for years, okay?

00:32.733 --> 00:35.603
Helping you build
your sexual portfolio.

00:35.636 --> 00:39.006
We've had some good years,
some lean ones.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.942
But I got to say, when I look at
how you're currently positioned,

00:41.975 --> 00:44.612
it scares the hell out of me.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.714
Here's what I'd recommend
for a typical bro

00:46.747 --> 00:49.016
with your income
and attractiveness level.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.019
40% women at work,
40% bar hookups,

00:52.052 --> 00:54.122
and 20% ex-girlfriends.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.424
Now here's you.

00:56.457 --> 01:00.094
You are investing
100% of your resources

01:00.128 --> 01:01.529
into one girl.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.964
- Yeah. Yeah.
I really like her.

01:03.997 --> 01:07.901
- You want my advice?
Diversify.

01:07.935 --> 01:10.138
Here, take a look
at my personal breakdown.

01:10.171 --> 01:14.475
As you can see, I have
zero percent in girlfriends,

01:14.508 --> 01:17.945
ten percent in randos,
five percent in strange,

01:17.978 --> 01:20.148
three percent in baristas,

01:20.181 --> 01:23.151
two percent
in confused tourists.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.820
Believe it or not, that has
produced amazing returns lately.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.123
Amazing returns.
- Yeah. Right.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.091
Uh, well,
thank you very much, Mike,

01:31.125 --> 01:33.661
eh, but I'm very happy
with Lucy.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.095
(lighter whirs)

01:35.129 --> 01:37.498
- Who?
- My girlfriend, Lucy.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.832
- Hi, again.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.435
- Hi, again.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.904
- Oh...

01:43.937 --> 01:46.073
(down-tempo electronic music)

01:46.106 --> 01:47.508
*

01:47.541 --> 01:48.609
- Ah!

01:48.642 --> 01:52.280
*

01:52.313 --> 01:53.914
- (squeaks)

01:53.947 --> 01:56.016
*

01:56.049 --> 01:57.251
- (growls)

01:57.285 --> 01:59.019
*

02:13.033 --> 02:14.535
(birds chirping)

02:14.568 --> 02:16.670
- I don't think your friend
Mike likes me very much.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.306
- What?
- Yeah.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.707
- He-he likes you.
- Really?

02:19.740 --> 02:21.108
- He just doesn't
know you very well.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.310
- I guess...yeah,
you...you could be right.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.377
Maybe we just haven't
hung out enough.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.545
- Yeah.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.046
- We should think
of, like, a bonding thing

02:26.079 --> 02:27.348
we could all do together.
- Yeah.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.016
Uh, there's this bar
he really likes going to.

02:29.049 --> 02:32.019
- Okay, maybe we could
all go there after work?

02:32.052 --> 02:33.321
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, that's great.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.555
Oh, we're gonna be besties.
I just know it.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.991
Hi.
- Where's Josh?

02:38.025 --> 02:39.960
- Uh, he'll probably here
really soon.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.830
(video game beeping)

02:42.863 --> 02:43.964
- Goal!

02:43.997 --> 02:45.333
- So where is this place?

02:45.366 --> 02:47.301
- Uh, it's a couple doors down,

02:47.335 --> 02:52.172
then 2,000 feet into the belly
of a Chilean copper mine.

02:52.206 --> 02:55.376
(exotic woodwind music)

02:55.409 --> 02:57.411
*

03:02.416 --> 03:05.018
- Oh, this place is great.
(video game beeping)

03:05.052 --> 03:07.721
- Goal!

03:07.755 --> 03:09.823
- Mmm, my beer's good.

03:09.857 --> 03:13.661
The guy said it was,
uh, a microbrew?

03:13.694 --> 03:15.496
Hey, it's like, um...

03:15.529 --> 03:18.932
Mike-ro-brew.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.434
It's like your name's
right in there.

03:20.468 --> 03:23.371
If it was mine,
it'd be Lu-Luc...

03:23.404 --> 03:25.439
- No goal.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.575
(cell phone ringing)

03:27.608 --> 03:29.543
- It's Josh!
It's Josh.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.779
Hi, are you almost here?
- Well, it's official.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.881
Life loves to throw us
curveballs.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.416
- What?
What are you talking about?

03:35.449 --> 03:36.850
- Oh, just got slammed

03:36.884 --> 03:39.219
with a late-in-the-day
highlighter shipment.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.188
(men clamoring)
- Sorry, what? Honey,
it's really hard to hear you.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.456
- Oh, nothing.
Just that I'll have to place

03:42.490 --> 03:44.358
all the yellows
with the yellows by hand

03:44.392 --> 03:46.694
and the blues with the blues,
et cetera, et cetera.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.096
I won't be there for another
half an hour at least.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.599
- You're not gonna be here
for half an hour?

03:51.632 --> 03:54.568
(explosion, man screams)

03:54.602 --> 03:57.771
(men screaming in Spanish)

03:57.805 --> 03:58.839
(men coughing)

04:02.943 --> 04:04.578
- Uh, well, it looks like
it's just gonna be us

04:04.612 --> 04:05.746
for a little while.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.881
- (sighs) Sucks.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.583
- (sighs)

04:09.617 --> 04:12.286
(epic music)

04:12.320 --> 04:14.822
- You're looking at the entrance
to hell on Earth.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.224
Trapped nearly half a mile
beneath the surface

04:17.257 --> 04:19.493
are Mike and Lucy.

04:19.527 --> 04:23.331
They have no food, no water,
and, most importantly,

04:23.364 --> 04:26.600
no mutual friend
to help make conversation.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.268
In a last-ditch effort,

04:28.302 --> 04:31.639
rescue crews are sending
conversation starters down

04:31.672 --> 04:33.341
through drilled holes.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.113
- Hey.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.615
Wow. Awesome.
Okay.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.784
- Ugh!

04:43.817 --> 04:45.819
- Oh, these are great.
Okay.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.655
What is your favorite band?

04:47.688 --> 04:50.157
- Ugh.
- No? No good? Okay.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.860
Um...
do you have any siblings?

04:52.893 --> 04:55.162
- Where's Josh? Josh.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.464
- Oh, hey, this is good.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.599
What character are you
from Sex and the City?

04:58.632 --> 05:01.502
'Cause I'm... I'm a Charlotte.
- I can't take it any longer.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.170
(gun cocks)
Tell Josh I love him.

05:03.203 --> 05:07.808
- Man, damn it, why is Josh
always late to everything?

05:07.841 --> 05:09.777
- Huh.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.312
Yeah, that's true.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.147
Josh is late for everything.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.516
- Oh, my God, we're talking.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.884
We're talking. This is good.
This is so good.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.486
This is very good.
Uh, Josh stuff.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.688
Josh stuff. More Josh stuff.
Josh stuff. Um...

05:20.721 --> 05:22.556
More Josh stuff.
- (gasps)

05:22.590 --> 05:24.324
- Oh, hey! You ever
notice how Josh, um...

05:24.358 --> 05:26.159
he gets ready in the bathroom,
and it takes him, like, an hour,

05:26.193 --> 05:28.128
and then when he comes out,
he's un-showered in, like,

05:28.161 --> 05:30.297
a T-shirt and jeans,
and you're like,

05:30.330 --> 05:31.832
"What are you...
what are you doing in there...

05:31.865 --> 05:33.667
for so long?" You know?

05:33.701 --> 05:36.069
- Yeah, he does do that.
- Yeah.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.472
- It's like,
"What is going on in there?"

05:38.506 --> 05:39.807
- No idea.
I can tell you it's not...

05:39.840 --> 05:42.175
it's not hygiene-related.
- (laughs)

05:42.209 --> 05:43.844
That's kind of funny.
- Man, I got way more.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.246
Okay, well, l-last night
we were watching, um...

05:46.279 --> 05:47.648
Actually, you know what,
that's... I'm not gonna...

05:47.681 --> 05:49.182
That one's really personal.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.651
(gun cocks)
- (grunts)

05:50.684 --> 05:52.185
(gun clicks)
(grunts)

05:52.219 --> 05:54.154
Ah, here she comes.
- (stammers)

05:54.187 --> 05:56.256
You just have to promise
not to tell anybody.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.425
- Mm-hmm.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.726
- Like, really swear.
- Sure.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.260
- Okay, um...

06:00.293 --> 06:02.362
so last night, we were
watching Cool Runnings,

06:02.396 --> 06:04.765
and at the end,
Josh cried so loud

06:04.798 --> 06:06.233
that I had to
turn up the volume.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.701
- (laughing)

06:07.735 --> 06:10.370
Oh, my God. For real?
- Yeah.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.173
And then he asked me if I could
hold him until he fell asleep.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.443
- Oh, man, so good.
What else you got?

06:15.476 --> 06:18.779
- Um... do you know about
his crippling fear of horses?

06:18.812 --> 06:20.514
- Horses?
No way.

06:20.548 --> 06:23.050
- He sees one, and he gets all,
like, shaky and...and sweaty,

06:23.083 --> 06:25.419
and he freaks out.
- Ha! Spaz.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.787
- There's an air
of optimism here,

06:26.820 --> 06:28.756
as we're being told
that Mike and Lucy

06:28.789 --> 06:31.224
have found
a source of conversation.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.894
It's truly a miracle from God.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.863
- He crapped his pants?
Could people tell?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.264
- Okay, well, no,
except then he kept yelling,

06:37.297 --> 06:38.432
"I just crapped my pants"

06:38.466 --> 06:39.633
over and over
and over again.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.535
(both laughing)

06:41.569 --> 06:45.105
(rumbling)

06:45.138 --> 06:46.239
- Hey, guys.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.240
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, baby.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.076
- Sorry I'm late.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.744
Ah.

06:50.778 --> 06:54.648
Huh, this place
is kind of a dive.

06:54.682 --> 06:57.751
Is that-is that... is that guy
eating that other guy?

06:57.785 --> 06:59.653
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

06:59.687 --> 07:02.222
- Should we try
someplace else or...

07:02.255 --> 07:03.323
- Sure.
- Okay, yeah, let's go.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.592
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.
- Yep.

07:04.625 --> 07:08.762
(happy Latin music)

07:08.796 --> 07:11.565
(woman singing in Spanish)

07:11.599 --> 07:13.601
*

07:17.270 --> 07:19.640
- So, did you guys do okay
in there without me?

07:19.673 --> 07:21.441
- Yeah. You know what,
we had... we had lots of fun.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.143
- Yeah, it was cool...
- Totally.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.612
- runnings.
(snorts)

07:24.645 --> 07:26.446
Cool Runnings.
(clears throat)

07:26.480 --> 07:28.181
- What... what does that mean?
- Do you want to go to the bar?

07:28.215 --> 07:31.284
- Okay, yeah.
- (giggles)

07:31.318 --> 07:33.186
- (laughs)

07:36.389 --> 07:38.291
- And, long story short, uh,

07:38.325 --> 07:39.760
I'm not allowed
to use the bathroom

07:39.793 --> 07:43.497
at any Hardee's location
across North America ever again.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.598
- Wow.
- Yeah.

07:44.632 --> 07:45.999
- That's intense.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.801
- I can't believe
I'm telling you all this

07:47.835 --> 07:50.470
really embarrassing, private
stuff about myself, you know?

07:50.504 --> 07:53.974
I-I'm usually
very, very guarded

07:54.007 --> 07:55.308
and secretive, you know?

07:55.342 --> 07:57.444
But I just...
I just... I trust you.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.179
I can tell you anything.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.281
I-I feel like you're a vault,
you know what I mean?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.283
(cell phone chimes)
Oh, one second.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.152
J-Josh...
- Oh, my God.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.319
Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

08:06.353 --> 08:08.488
- Doug sent me a picture
of a horse.

08:08.522 --> 08:11.158
I hate them so much.
I hate them so much.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.292
Whew.
(cell phone chimes)

08:12.325 --> 08:14.294
Oh, he just...

08:14.327 --> 08:15.963
texted me again.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.165
"Did I scare you?"

08:18.198 --> 08:19.499
Huh, that's curious.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.334
You're, like, literally
the only person

08:21.368 --> 08:25.005
I've ever told about my, uh,
fear of horses, so...

08:25.038 --> 08:27.841
Huh. Hmm.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.010
- Okay.
You know what? Um...

08:30.043 --> 08:32.412
I got to split.
Love you.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.347
(line trilling)

08:34.381 --> 08:35.849
(cell phone ringing)
- Hello?

08:35.883 --> 08:37.517
- Mike...
- Oh, hey, Laura.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.686
- Lucy.
Still... still Lucy.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.220
Listen, are you telling people

08:40.253 --> 08:41.321
all that stuff
I told you about Josh?

08:41.354 --> 08:42.856
- Oh, yeah, big-time.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.092
- Mike, what the hell?
All of that was confidential.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.393
You swore
you wouldn't say anything.

08:46.426 --> 08:48.195
- I know.
But then I realized

08:48.228 --> 08:50.197
the magnitude of
what you were telling me--

08:50.230 --> 08:53.366
how funny the shit
about Josh was--

08:53.400 --> 08:55.268
and I realized
I could no longer stay silent.

08:55.302 --> 08:58.438
I had a responsibility
to tell the American people.

08:58.471 --> 09:02.109
(dramatic music)

09:02.142 --> 09:03.677
Now, if you'll excuse me,

09:03.711 --> 09:05.679
I need to conduct
an enormous press conference.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.247
- Shit. Shit.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.382
*

09:09.416 --> 09:12.586
- Julian Assange,
Edward Snowden,

09:12.620 --> 09:16.857
and now the most controversial
whistleblower yet...

09:16.890 --> 09:18.759
ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

09:18.792 --> 09:22.462
the man behind JoshiLeaks,
Mike Scaggs,

09:22.495 --> 09:24.364
joining us live via satellite

09:24.397 --> 09:27.267
from an undisclosed location
in Hong Kong.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.137
Mike, why are you in hiding?

09:30.170 --> 09:31.538
- Because I fear for my safety.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.806
Believe it or not,
there are some who think

09:32.840 --> 09:34.541
what I'm doing is wrong.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.710
- And do you think
what you're doing is wrong?

09:36.744 --> 09:39.446
- All I know is that the public
needs to be informed,

09:39.479 --> 09:42.449
because these revelations
about Josh are, like, so funny.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.317
Like, when you hear them,
you're like, "What?

09:44.351 --> 09:46.086
That's really funny."

09:46.119 --> 09:48.121
You know, like, that he cried
during Cool Runnings.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.589
- Wait, I-I'm sorry,
slow down.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.424
Am I hearing you correctly?

09:51.458 --> 09:55.495
Are you referring to
the 1993 comedy Cool Runnings?

09:55.528 --> 09:58.398
- I am.
- About those bobsled guys--

09:58.431 --> 10:00.600
the Jamaicans?
- Correct.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.103
- That's a kids' movie.
- Exactly.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.504
(crowd murmurs)

10:04.537 --> 10:05.773
(door opens)

10:05.806 --> 10:08.508
- Josh, Josh,
what are you doing here?

10:08.541 --> 10:09.777
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.511
- Uh, I was looking
for a bathroom,

10:11.544 --> 10:14.314
and I wandered into this
international press conference.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.784
What, uh, what-what
is the subject matter?

10:16.817 --> 10:18.652
- Um, you know what?
Uh, nothing.

10:18.686 --> 10:19.753
It's-it's kind of boring.
Do you want to get out of here?

10:19.787 --> 10:21.254
You can use
the bathroom next door.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.656
- I can't.
It's a Hardee's.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.357
- What else can I tell you
about Josh? - What the hell?

10:24.391 --> 10:26.259
- He got lost at the mall
when he was 16.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.095
Oh, in middle school,
he got a boner

10:28.128 --> 10:29.963
during a clarinet recital.
- Gross.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.165
Now, Mike,
I know this might potentially

10:32.199 --> 10:33.934
be putting yourself at risk,

10:33.967 --> 10:35.836
but would you be prepared
at this time

10:35.869 --> 10:37.304
to do a mean impression

10:37.337 --> 10:40.708
of Josh getting a boner
at that clarinet recital?

10:40.741 --> 10:43.443
- What... what-what is going on?
- Um...

10:43.476 --> 10:45.813
- I can only speculate
it went something like this.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.949
(humming snake charmer melody)

10:48.982 --> 10:50.150
Boing!

10:50.183 --> 10:51.484
- This theory, of course,

10:51.518 --> 10:55.222
implying that
Josh is the snake charmer,

10:55.255 --> 10:57.390
charming his boner,
which is the snake.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.293
- (humming snake charmer melody)

11:00.327 --> 11:03.964
(whiny voice) Oh, no! My boner's
going into my clarinet.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.134
It's like I'm having
sex with it, and I like it.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.369
(imitates sobbing)

11:09.402 --> 11:11.304
(normal voice) Of course, we
don't have all the information.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.174
- Of course. It's not outside
the realm of possibilities.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.909
It-it could've been
more like...

11:15.943 --> 11:17.978
(goofy voice) "Ooh!
It's stuck in the clarinet.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.013
Hey, janitor, help!"

11:20.047 --> 11:22.082
(normal voice) Is that...
- Yes.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.686
- How does Mike know
all this stuff about me?

11:26.720 --> 11:27.988
- I'd like to thank
my informant,

11:28.021 --> 11:30.991
who at this time
I will not name...

11:31.024 --> 11:32.726
because I'm blanking on it,

11:32.760 --> 11:34.728
uh, but it's
Josh's girlfriend.

11:34.762 --> 11:37.197
She told me everything.
(laughs)

11:37.230 --> 11:39.232
Just blabbed away.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.700
- (scoffs)
- Hey, Josh, Josh, listen...

11:40.734 --> 11:41.902
- How could you do that?

11:41.935 --> 11:44.271
The entire world
is laughing at me.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.006
- Because Mike told
everybody, not me.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.841
- Yeah, of course
Mike told everybody.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.443
I would expect that from him,
but not from you.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.012
I trusted you.
- I know. I'm...

11:52.045 --> 11:53.380
I know, I'm s-sorry.
J-Josh.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.082
(humming snake charmer melody)

11:55.115 --> 11:58.118
Anyway, peace out, queefs.
(blows raspberry)

12:09.096 --> 12:11.965
- (sighs)
(knock at door)

12:11.999 --> 12:14.134
(groans)
- Oh, hey, uh...

12:14.167 --> 12:16.469
Mara or...
- Lucy.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.272
- Where's Josh?
- I don't know.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.975
He's still mad at me.
- (laughs) Oh, yeah.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.277
You told me all that stuff,
and then I told everyone else.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.646
(laughs)
So good.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.982
All right, well, just came
to pick up my Final Battle II,

12:29.016 --> 12:31.251
so I'm out of here.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.653
- Wow, you're a real asshole,
you know that?

12:33.686 --> 12:35.322
- Whoa,
where's that coming from?

12:35.355 --> 12:37.157
- Do you have any idea
how hard it is

12:37.190 --> 12:38.591
to try to be friends with you?

12:38.625 --> 12:40.293
- Why does it matter
if we're friends?

12:40.327 --> 12:43.063
- (whispers) Jesus.
All right, yeah, you know what?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.832
You're probably right.
It was stupid and pointless.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.834
I don't know why I forced it.
- Yeah, that was weird.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.168
Why'd you do that?

12:48.201 --> 12:49.569
- Because you're
Josh's best friend,

12:49.602 --> 12:50.603
and I love Josh.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.272
- For real?
Like, even though

12:52.305 --> 12:53.841
you know all that
embarrassing shit about him?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.275
- Of course.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.110
That goofy stuff is
part of why I love him.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.146
Thanks to you,
he hates me now.

12:59.179 --> 13:02.983
- Oh...
(cell phone chimes)

13:03.016 --> 13:04.317
- (sighs)
Here we go.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.819
He just sent me
a really cold text

13:05.853 --> 13:07.620
asking if I can
meet him downtown

13:07.654 --> 13:09.356
'cause he wants to "tell me
something in person."

13:09.389 --> 13:12.525
- I'm sure it's fine.
How mad could he be?

13:12.559 --> 13:14.862
- Bring out the accused!

13:14.895 --> 13:17.197
(mob shouting)

13:17.230 --> 13:19.666
- Make way
for the Lord's work.

13:19.699 --> 13:22.769
- You shouldn't have told
secrets about Josh.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.705
- He opened up to you,
and you broke his trust.

13:25.738 --> 13:29.642
- That's private stuff!
Private stuff!

13:29.676 --> 13:31.644
(drum banging, mob booing)

13:34.214 --> 13:35.648
- Josh... Josh,
can we talk about this?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.851
- I think you've talked enough.
- (sighs)

13:37.885 --> 13:40.120
- For the high crimes
of telling people

13:40.153 --> 13:42.355
I cried during Cool Runnings,

13:42.389 --> 13:45.158
as well as telling people
I got lost at the mall,

13:45.192 --> 13:47.727
as well as telling people
that I crapped my pants

13:47.760 --> 13:49.062
while suspended in the air

13:49.096 --> 13:50.998
during a high-school production
of Peter Pan...

13:51.031 --> 13:52.232
- No, Josh, I didn't
tell him that one.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.733
- You... you didn't?
- No.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.235
- 'Cause I got a text
from Nikhil

13:55.268 --> 13:57.204
making fun of me
for crapping my pants.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.405
- No, I told him
about a different time

13:58.438 --> 14:00.673
that you crapped your pants.
- Oh.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.509
The subway?
- No.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.144
- The tramway?

14:04.177 --> 14:05.678
- How many times
has this happened?

14:05.712 --> 14:07.080
(mob murmurs)

14:07.114 --> 14:08.648
- That doesn't...
That hardly matters.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.718
The point is I declare
this woman guilty!

14:11.751 --> 14:14.487
(mob cheers)
- Yeah! String her up!

14:14.521 --> 14:16.156
Ha ha!
This is happening!

14:16.189 --> 14:18.558
Oh, this is happening!

14:18.591 --> 14:19.559
- Yes, it is.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.094
(arrow whooshes)

14:21.128 --> 14:23.663
(mob gasps)

14:23.696 --> 14:25.565
- Mike?

14:25.598 --> 14:29.069
- Oh, (bleep), it's a horse.
Oh, man, it had to be a horse.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.671
- Sir. Hey.
Hey, madam.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.274
(triumphant music)

14:34.307 --> 14:36.543
I'm here to speak
in this lady's defense!

14:36.576 --> 14:38.545
(mob groans)

14:38.578 --> 14:42.115
When I first met this woman,
I believed her to be very lame.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.783
I was like, "What is this?

14:43.816 --> 14:45.452
I don't know
what's up with this."

14:45.485 --> 14:47.754
I was also like,
"Why this one?"

14:47.787 --> 14:49.689
And given some time,
I was like,

14:49.722 --> 14:52.525
"This one, still?
But why?

14:52.559 --> 14:55.062
What's going on here?
What is this?"

14:55.095 --> 14:57.230
Then I talked to her
and hung out with her a little,

14:57.264 --> 15:00.533
and one fact shone so bright,
it could not be denied.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.603
She loves my buddy.
Big-time,

15:03.636 --> 15:05.605
and that is very rare.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.108
Most girls are like,
"That guy? Why?"

15:08.141 --> 15:11.311
And also like, "No way, not him.
I'd rather not."

15:11.344 --> 15:15.582
And at times, they're like,
"What is going on there? Ugh."

15:15.615 --> 15:18.151
Anyway, this
girlfriend is cool!

15:18.185 --> 15:20.653
(mob cheers)

15:20.687 --> 15:23.456
Also, dude, it feels like
you're kind of overreacting.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.657
- Yeah.
Yeah, I know.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.994
- You hired a hangman?
- Mm.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.162
- And I had to kill him?
That's nuts.

15:29.196 --> 15:31.298
I'm a murderer now.
(stammers)

15:31.331 --> 15:33.000
That's crazy.
- Yeah.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.735
Sorry, Lucy.
- It's okay. I'm sorry.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.770
(mob cheering, whistling)

15:37.804 --> 15:41.474
- The charges have been dropped!
(mob cheers)

15:41.508 --> 15:44.477
- Wait, you-you still gonna
hang someone, though, right?

15:44.511 --> 15:47.680
- Uh, no, not today.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.516
- Hey, congrats, man.
You got a good one.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.651
- Thanks, I know.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.686
- Hang someone!
- No.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.522
- What do you even get
out of it anyway?

15:55.555 --> 15:57.190
- It's exciting.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.492
- Hey, uh, you want to grab
a beer or something?

15:59.526 --> 16:01.361
- Sure.
Do you want to come, Lucy?

16:01.394 --> 16:03.263
- Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.265
(cheerful music)

16:05.298 --> 16:09.036
- Hey, uh, looks like everyone's
gonna go grab one, huh?

16:09.069 --> 16:12.372
Very cool. Very cool.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.606
- Uh...

16:13.640 --> 16:16.443
- Yeah, do you...

16:16.476 --> 16:17.677
do you want to come?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.979
- Sure, if you insist, uh...

16:20.013 --> 16:23.016
This turned out
to be a fun evening.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.385
Want to know something?
- What's that?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.687
- You guys
are my best friends.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.023
- Oh, that's...that's cool.
- Aw, that's really nice.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.858
- That's, you know...
- Yeah.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.129
(music thumping)

16:36.163 --> 16:38.331
- Dude, are you seeing this?
- Hmm?

16:38.365 --> 16:40.967
- Those babes are totally
vibing my bozack.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.802
Should I mack the one
on the right or the left?

16:42.835 --> 16:45.405
- Uh, I feel like the one
on the right is more your type.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.374
- Yeah, what
do you think, Lucy?

16:47.407 --> 16:50.210
- Oh, uh, yeah, yeah,
definitely the one on the right.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.811
Plus, the one on the left
has a wedding ring.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.146
BOTH: Whoa.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.515
- Got an insider
working for us here.

16:55.548 --> 16:59.086
Wish me luck.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.921
- That's really nice what
you did for your friend there.

17:01.954 --> 17:05.358
You think you could help me
find a man?

17:05.392 --> 17:06.926
- Yeah.
Totally, Methelda.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.329
Uh, what about
that guy right there?

17:09.362 --> 17:10.830
- Oh, he looks
like a screamer.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.399
Mm-mmm.
- Right.

17:12.432 --> 17:16.269
Well, there's also that guy.
I mean, he seems cool.

17:16.303 --> 17:20.240
- Ooh, he's got a thick neck.
Looks like a defecator.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.008
- All right,
so, just to be clear,

17:22.041 --> 17:23.910
are you looking for a guy
more for, like... for dating

17:23.943 --> 17:25.011
or more...
- Hanging! (laughs)

17:25.044 --> 17:26.379
- Right.
- Got ya.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.348
- Lots of these guys,
now that I'm looking,

17:28.381 --> 17:30.450
could be potential hangers.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.586
Someone here had to do
something wrong, right?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.388
- Hey, you ever notice how
we always talk about hanging?

17:35.422 --> 17:37.424
- Yeah.
- Ooh, I'm sorry.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.925
You know what? I brought
some conversation starters, too.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.127
- Oh.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.562
- Which Sex and the City
character would you be?

17:42.595 --> 17:45.732
I'm a Samantha,
believe it or not.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.935
- Yeah, I gue...
I guess that makes sense...

17:48.968 --> 17:50.470
of the four.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.038
- Let me go
to this next one.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.275
What's your favorite form
of execution?

17:55.308 --> 17:58.111
BOTH: Methelda!
- (laughs)

17:58.145 --> 18:00.046
(upbeat music)

18:00.079 --> 18:04.484
- * Living and laughing,
loving and a-learning *

18:04.517 --> 18:07.220
*

18:07.254 --> 18:11.991
* Moving and grooving and
sometimes there's a hanging *

18:12.024 --> 18:14.161
*

18:14.194 --> 18:15.828
* The chips may be down

18:15.862 --> 18:19.632
* But everything is looking
up, up, up, up *

18:19.666 --> 18:21.601
* It's The Methelda Show *

18:21.634 --> 18:23.270
ALL:
* It's The Methelda Show *

18:23.303 --> 18:26.273
- * It's The Methelda Show *

18:26.306 --> 18:27.907
- The Methelda Show
was filmed

18:27.940 --> 18:30.009
in front
of a live studio audience.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.645
(Golden Suits' "Gold Feeling")

18:32.679 --> 18:34.681
*

18:38.485 --> 18:42.422
- * Do you want it?
Do you really want it? *

18:42.455 --> 18:45.792
* A joyful drag

18:45.825 --> 18:50.463
* All the history,
all together *

18:50.497 --> 18:52.932
* The round track

18:52.965 --> 18:56.869
* I don't care, I don't care,
I don't care *

18:56.903 --> 19:00.006
*

19:09.048 --> 19:11.050
