00:13.520 --> 00:16.680
Gwen? Good morning.

00:18.840 --> 00:21.360
Gwen?

02:29.440 --> 02:31.640
Hey.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.200
Gwen.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.440
-Hi.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.500
Hello.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.100
Morning, Sarge.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.780
This bloke you locked up
last night,

05:13.880 --> 05:16.300
male Caucasian, 27 years of age,

05:16.400 --> 05:19.140
surname Meoff, first name Jack.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.140
Yeah.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.460
Didn't occur to you it could be
a fake name,

05:23.560 --> 05:26.940
Jack Meoff?

05:27.040 --> 05:29.760
Well, yeah, when you say it
like that.

05:33.920 --> 05:37.640
Where am I

05:46.600 --> 05:48.600
How do you feel?

05:53.240 --> 05:55.840
I feel awake.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.160
I feel alive.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.040
It's wonderful.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.680
What happened here?

06:16.520 --> 06:19.260
Something happened here.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.280
-That's where Alfie drowned.
-Alfie?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.740
When?

06:25.840 --> 06:28.180
I don't remember that.
Why don't I remember that?

06:28.280 --> 06:30.280
Ray!

06:31.240 --> 06:33.320
Let's get you inside. Come on.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.860
Ray.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.960
G'day, mate.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.640
-What's going on?
-Um...

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Something I can help you with?

06:48.800 --> 06:51.140
Is Gwen here No.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.620
-Ever since the flood, mate...
-I know...

06:53.720 --> 06:56.320
..she's in the home, but...

07:01.680 --> 07:03.680
Never mind.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.940
I'll tell her you were asking
after her.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.040
She'll appreciate it.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.760
See you, Max.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.940
Do you think he saw you?

07:40.040 --> 07:41.380
I don't think so.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.320
-You alright?
-I'm alright.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.240
I'm better than alright.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.820
Here's some clothes, sir.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.700
Who are you
and what's your name, mate?

08:02.800 --> 08:03.900
Ah, Mick, Mick Waterman,

08:04.000 --> 08:05.900
and if you don't mind,
I'm bursting for a piss here

08:06.000 --> 08:08.620
but I get a bit embarrassed
in front of an audience.

08:08.720 --> 08:09.740
Just put your clothes on, sir.

08:09.840 --> 08:12.300
-How did you get in here?
-Well, you tell me.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.740
I was passing through,
walking through the park,

08:15.840 --> 08:17.820
having a few cold ones,
nothing wrong with that.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.900
Next thing I know
I wake up here.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.020
No wallet, in my birthday suit,

08:24.120 --> 08:28.460
like...like I've been molested
or something.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.980
Sarge, last night I locked a kid
up in this cell, right?

08:32.080 --> 08:34.900
No ID, I photographed him,
I printed him.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.100
I have no idea what happened
to him.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.260
Is that like the time

08:38.360 --> 08:40.700
you had no idea what happened to
Jim McGaskell's marijuana...

08:40.800 --> 08:43.020
Excuse me,
I really am brewing here.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.540
No, no, nothing like that.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.060
Isn't there some rule
about four hours being holed up?

08:47.160 --> 08:49.940
-This is fucking nuts, OK?

08:50.040 --> 08:53.060
Oh.
-Oh. Oh, God. Sir...

08:53.160 --> 08:55.420
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.900
No, we're very sorry,
Mr Waterman.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.260
Senior Constable Griffiths will
have you out of here right away.

09:02.360 --> 09:05.920
And then he'll clean
this mess up.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.720
Just put your clothes on, mate.

09:16.320 --> 09:22.000
That was very good of her
to apologise like that.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.400
Didn't hear a peep out of you,
though.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.580
The national anthem of Japan.

09:48.680 --> 09:52.180
-This is just lovely, isn't it?

09:52.280 --> 09:55.720
Something to really lift
the spirits of the whole town.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.800
Why would somebody
do something like this?

10:12.240 --> 10:14.240
Why would they do it?

11:35.120 --> 11:37.060
Thanks very much, mate.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.760
Yeah, much appreciated.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.720
I'd better get that.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.340
Hello?

15:22.440 --> 15:24.740
Oh, Margot. I should've called.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.140
She's here and she's OK.

15:28.240 --> 15:32.120
No, no, no, she's...she's
really, ah...

15:33.200 --> 15:35.800
She's really well, actually.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.360
Oh, boy.

15:40.880 --> 15:44.880
Margot, um, I've gotta...
I've gotta go.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.720
Are you sure this is OK?

15:56.760 --> 15:59.220
Come on. Out you go. Out you go.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.460
Ah, no you don't.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.580
There's a process here, Max.
You know that.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.900
You sign in, ask if our resident
would like a visitor.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.540
Is Gwen here?

16:25.640 --> 16:29.080
She's being cared for.
Come on.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.740
Holy shit. That's him.
Holy shit!

16:44.840 --> 16:47.500
His name's Tommy Brydon. 68.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.780
Wanted for the murder

16:48.880 --> 16:51.100
of Melbourne crime boss
Antonio Russo

16:51.200 --> 16:54.740
who this guy left in a recycle
bin, minus seven of his fingers.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.740
Although one was later found
inserted in his anal passage

16:57.840 --> 16:59.900
so guess that makes six.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.180
Yep, that's a puzzler.

17:03.280 --> 17:06.580
And we had him
right here in our cell.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.540
Then... I mean,
I've got no idea how...

17:09.640 --> 17:10.820
Oh, it gets better, mate.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.260
You know the prints you took
of your kid?

17:13.360 --> 17:15.780
They came back.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.860
They're Brydon's.
So you did arrest him.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.100
You've done it again,
haven't you?

17:21.200 --> 17:23.620
This takes the cake.
This is a whole new level...

17:23.720 --> 17:25.140
Sarge, I didn't arrest this guy.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.880
You need to find him right now.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.840
Shit!

19:11.560 --> 19:13.560
You.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.920
Us.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.280
All-time greatest.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.340
Alright.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.440
I'll see you later.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.360
Hey, um...

19:33.120 --> 19:35.120
Are you hungry?

19:36.120 --> 19:38.280
I made some new pies.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.880
OK.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.260
Let's just, you know,

19:58.360 --> 20:02.960
wait...wait a second
or a few seconds...maybe...

20:07.440 --> 20:09.300
Yeah.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.400
Of course.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.180
We've got all the time
in the world.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.280
Yeah.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.460
We can do anything we want now.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.560
Yeah.

20:29.840 --> 20:32.860
All the things we never did.

20:32.960 --> 20:38.360
Yeah, but let's, you know,
take it day by day, hey?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
That'd be good.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.740
Hmm. I'm hungry.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.060
-Are you hungry?
-Ah...

20:54.160 --> 20:55.820
I'm starving.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.240
Yeah. OK.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.940
This is it

21:10.040 --> 21:13.500
-Well, there's plenty of...
-Don't say tins.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.780
Tins.

21:15.880 --> 21:19.540
Hello?

21:19.640 --> 21:21.640
Oh, shit.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.040
Who's that?

21:29.680 --> 21:31.680
Get back in.

21:35.800 --> 21:36.900
Loris.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.420
Oh, Ray, how is she

21:39.520 --> 21:42.940
I heard. I was at the home
dropping off some magazines

21:43.040 --> 21:44.980
and Margot told me.

21:45.080 --> 21:46.780
She's very worried.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.780
She doesn't need to be worried.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.380
I mean, Gwen's fine, she's here,
she's resting.

21:51.480 --> 21:52.540
Thanks for checking in.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.500
I know what
you're going through.

21:54.600 --> 21:55.940
Herb and I...

21:56.040 --> 21:59.900
Well, he's my right hand
in spite of his obstacles

22:00.000 --> 22:03.740
and the mere thought
of losing him,

22:03.840 --> 22:06.940
the thought of you losing her
to this awful disease...

22:07.040 --> 22:09.220
Yeah, well, I appreciate that,
Loris.

22:09.320 --> 22:12.620
Well, you've got to do
the best for her now.

22:12.720 --> 22:16.020
I mean, she's not the same woman
any longer.

22:16.120 --> 22:19.360
-No.
-As awful as that sounds.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.780
Ah, that's Natalie, my niece.

22:25.880 --> 22:29.560
You know how kids are, they
sleep all day, eat everything.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.120
Bye, Loris.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.940
And how are we gonna
explain this to everyone?

22:47.040 --> 22:50.020
Both of us just disappearing?

22:50.120 --> 22:52.460
We don't have to.

22:52.560 --> 22:58.020
We can just...leave,
go anywhere we want.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.700
Start over.

23:00.800 --> 23:05.400
Our families

23:08.800 --> 23:10.840
We could make a new one.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.280
For the record,
I'm gonna miss this face.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.660
G'day, captain.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.900
How's it going?

23:56.000 --> 23:59.320
-Bit of porn time, eh?
-It's reconnaissance.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.320
Is that what all this stuff is?

24:06.880 --> 24:08.700
What's this one?

24:08.800 --> 24:10.800
It's where I've searched
already.

24:12.840 --> 24:15.140
-And this?
-It's where the others died.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.740
The sites.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.860
Mate, this is the most
depressing cubby

24:18.960 --> 24:21.040
I've ever been to.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.140
You really reckon
she's still alive, eh?

24:28.240 --> 24:30.140
It defies logic that her car,

24:30.240 --> 24:32.980
which was only driving to the
shops, has never been found.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.620
These are the places
I'd still need to search.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.320
But they're more than a day's
bike ride.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.480
Well, then, we should drive.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.340
Meet me here first thing
tomorrow.

24:52.440 --> 24:54.480
Come on. It's getting late.
You've got to go.

25:04.760 --> 25:07.640
I've left you some bedding
and provisions.

25:09.160 --> 25:11.440
OK. Thanks.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.820
Hey.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.580
Hey. How was your day?

25:29.680 --> 25:32.380
Twilight Zone. That was my day.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.020
What happened?

25:34.120 --> 25:37.320
I can't tell you, can I?
Official police business.

25:44.840 --> 25:47.060
I did have this
cocky little punk

25:47.160 --> 25:49.140
that I locked up last night.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.140
He was talking shit about you

25:51.240 --> 25:55.900
and...well, he said that
the two of you were... You know?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.580
-Me?
-Yeah.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.960
Short hair, try-hard beard.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.420
What did he say?

26:06.520 --> 26:09.680
Let's just say he loved
your custard tarts.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.020
Did he?

26:14.120 --> 26:16.300
Tina, he was talking bullshit.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.740
You don't even think
it's possible

26:18.840 --> 26:20.880
that another younger man
might...

26:22.160 --> 26:23.860
..find me desirable?

26:23.960 --> 26:26.500
What are you on about No, that's not what...

26:26.600 --> 26:30.880
-I was defending you.
-Well, how very big of you.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.720
I don't feel anything.

26:45.160 --> 26:48.780
-You need another one.
-I've already had two.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.300
It's been half a day! Wh...

26:51.400 --> 26:53.840
-Why isn't it working?
-I don't know.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.960
Maybe you needed it more.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I mean, it is what it is.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.020
Gwen.

27:04.120 --> 27:08.820
If you can... I mean, if you can
bear to live with me

27:08.920 --> 27:10.900
as I am, like this...

27:11.000 --> 27:14.240
Of course I can.
It's not about that.

27:24.280 --> 27:27.660
When I was younger,
I didn't want to feel trapped.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.500
And I really thought
that what I was doing

27:29.600 --> 27:32.580
was far more meaningful
and that some day...

27:32.680 --> 27:35.500
..some day, like,
time was this infinite thing,

27:35.600 --> 27:38.380
that I'd have years and years
to throw away

27:38.480 --> 27:41.740
but that it would happen and
that I'd have a second chance.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.300
Second chance at what?

27:43.400 --> 27:46.800
Don't you see that this is why
this is happening to us?

27:51.200 --> 27:53.200
You want a baby.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.520
Don't you?

27:58.720 --> 28:00.720
Maybe back then.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.000
But not now.

28:11.760 --> 28:15.040
Oh, get a grip. Get a grip.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.140
I'm sorry.

28:36.240 --> 28:39.140
I'm sorry. I don't...
I don't know what came over me.

28:39.240 --> 28:40.260
I know.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.800
-I love you.
-I love you.

28:44.360 --> 28:47.580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:47.680 --> 28:50.100
I'm sorry.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.660
No, Gwen, no, no.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.760
Why?

28:55.720 --> 28:58.460
I'm not going to get you
pregnant.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.180
We don't know how this works.

29:00.280 --> 29:04.460
We don't even know
if...you are you.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.060
Of course I'm still me.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.640
I'm your wife of 47 years.

29:12.120 --> 29:14.120
Gwen, no.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.800
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

29:35.120 --> 29:37.860
Oh, who'd have believed it?

29:37.960 --> 29:41.860
This child prancing
into his bedroom,

29:41.960 --> 29:44.540
-while poor Gwen sleeps...

29:44.640 --> 29:47.100
Oh, oh, Herb, I'm sorry.

29:47.200 --> 29:51.940
Oh. Oh, it's still a bit raw,
isn't it?

29:52.040 --> 29:53.980
May be infected.

29:54.080 --> 29:58.140
But really, Ray,
Ray of all people.

29:58.240 --> 30:01.380
An academic, a scientist! Huh!

30:01.480 --> 30:03.780
An educator of children!

30:03.880 --> 30:07.740
Doesn't anyone
have any control anymore?

30:07.840 --> 30:10.420
Any bloody morality?

30:10.520 --> 30:13.380
I don't know how a man
can justify such actions.

31:13.480 --> 31:17.100
Yeah, that's him, alright.
Those ferret eyes.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.580
Real piece of work.
Came out of nowhere.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.380
I'm very sorry, sir.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.700
At least there doesn't appear
to be any damage to the vehicle.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.060
Oh, thank Christ.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.440
Pardon me, sir.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.100
Isaac.

31:34.200 --> 31:37.140
Sergeant Stokes, may I please
have a glass of water

31:37.240 --> 31:38.660
for my medication?

31:38.760 --> 31:40.700
It needs to be taken at 9am
precisely.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.160
Yeah, yeah, OK,
just hang on a minute.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.460
-He was in my car...
-So he was already in the garage?

31:52.560 --> 31:54.560
Yeah he was already in there.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.420
-He came out of nowhere?
-No he came out of the car.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.520
So he got out of the car?

32:07.920 --> 32:10.520
You little legend!

32:11.960 --> 32:13.380
-Any problems?
-Nah.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.940
They were talking to a guy
with a bandage on his head.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.300
It was probably Uncle Charlie.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.000
He shouldn't drive
in his condition.

32:21.480 --> 32:24.340
The national anthem
of Uruguay.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.920
Is that my car?

32:47.600 --> 32:50.020
Right, forward and up.

32:50.120 --> 32:53.580
Now, get a bit of go
and drop 'em down.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.220
-Hear the engine?
-Hear the engine.

32:55.320 --> 32:56.860
-Forward and up.
-Forward and up.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.700
-Let me hear it!
-Forward and up.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.800
Alright, now...

33:02.040 --> 33:03.500
-You feel that?
-Yeah, I feel it.

33:03.600 --> 33:04.900
-Now where do I go?
-Forward and down.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.720
Forward and down!
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

33:11.880 --> 33:13.780
Come on, Zacky, let's hear it!

33:13.880 --> 33:15.980
-Yeah!
-Woo-hoo-hoo!

33:21.840 --> 33:24.160
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

33:29.040 --> 33:30.460
What? I can't hear you, mate.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.860
-Yeah, woo-hoo!
-There it is!

33:32.960 --> 33:36.720
-Let me hear it again.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.620
-You're up.
-I'm up?

33:49.720 --> 33:51.720
You're driving.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.180
But I'm only 12.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.780
Alright, whatever you do,
keep your hands on the wheel

33:57.880 --> 34:00.340
and keep it straight. Got it?

34:00.440 --> 34:02.020
Alright, I'm gonna let go
of the clutch.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.620
We're gonna do a burnout.

34:03.720 --> 34:05.660
Alright? Give it some gas.

34:05.760 --> 34:07.460
And three...

34:07.560 --> 34:09.020
..two...

34:09.120 --> 34:11.140
..one...

34:16.120 --> 34:18.340
That's what we call a bunny hop.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.020
Go left. Go left!

34:23.120 --> 34:26.160
-Go left!

35:26.800 --> 35:28.800
Damn it!

35:31.200 --> 35:33.200
Hi, Max.

35:35.360 --> 35:38.180
Hey. Hey, there you are.

35:38.280 --> 35:41.580
Come on, we're going now.
It's time to go.

35:41.680 --> 35:44.180
-Come and meet me.
-Come on.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.420
I'm fine.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.340
What did you think
you were doing?

35:47.440 --> 35:49.940
Just... I'm fine! Hey, get off.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.040
Let's have a chat.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.300
Oh, shit.

37:30.400 --> 37:33.340
Ohhh, shit.

37:45.240 --> 37:47.240
Well, hello.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.440
G'day.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.560
Wow. Know who you look like?

38:13.600 --> 38:16.340
-Who do I look like?

38:16.440 --> 38:19.700
And I would
follow you

38:19.800 --> 38:22.040
to the ends of the earth!

38:25.400 --> 38:27.420
River Swan, right?

38:27.520 --> 38:30.860
It was an absolute classic.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.940
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:33.040 --> 38:37.400
That was, what, decades ago,
right, so...

38:39.240 --> 38:43.800
..well, either you've had
some serious work done, or...

38:45.160 --> 38:47.500
..or not.

38:47.600 --> 38:52.540
I bet you're feeling...
pretty good, huh?

38:52.640 --> 38:54.660
Full of beans.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.760
Sexual.

38:58.560 --> 39:00.560
It's OK.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.400
It's OK.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.940
I had one too.

39:08.040 --> 39:11.240
I found it
in the weirdest place.

39:12.960 --> 39:15.220
-Fuck off.
-Yeah, no worries.

39:15.320 --> 39:19.320
I'll be seeing you soon...
Gwendolyn Reed.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.960
Ray.

40:19.120 --> 40:21.160
It doesn't last.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.460
Hey!

40:36.560 --> 40:39.340
-Oh, hello, Gwendolyn Reed.
-Give that back!

40:39.440 --> 40:41.660
I'd follow you
to the ends of the earth.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.580
-Give it back!
-Come on, then!

40:43.680 --> 40:47.660
Hey, hey!

40:47.760 --> 40:51.140
Stay back, old man!
You're too old for this shit.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.480
Look at it! Look at it!
