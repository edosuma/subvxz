<i>Previously on Roswe“.</i>

00:03.636 --> 00:06.298
- Thought we agreed it was over.
- 'Cause you're destined to be with Isabel?

00:06.373 --> 00:08.398
I'm destined to be this soldier.

00:08.475 --> 00:11.103
- What is it you want from us?
- Where's the granilith?

00:11.177 --> 00:14.147
- The what? - Don't pretend you don't
know. We've been looking for it.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.443
The granilith.

00:27.527 --> 00:31.327
Sounds like the fluorescent lights
in bio lab.

00:31.398 --> 00:34.459
Did Nasedo ever mention
a rock collection?

00:34.534 --> 00:36.662
Do you think it can hear us?

00:43.176 --> 00:46.441
We'll come back after school.

00:46.513 --> 00:49.141
After ninth period, we'll go back.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.048
Way to prioritize, Maxwell.

00:52.118 --> 00:55.019
<i>He)'- New gel?</i>

00:55.088 --> 00:59.082
So, uh, Portishead tickets
went on sale this morning.

00:59.159 --> 01:02.129
- Did you get my messages?
- Yeah.

01:02.195 --> 01:06.189

- Nice.
- Our agenda involves the four of us.

01:08.835 --> 01:10.860
There's no time for distractions.

01:10.937 --> 01:13.599
Oh, Max, look.
I don't know what to do.

01:13.673 --> 01:17.200
Calls keep on coming into Congresswoman
Whitaker's office. Should I return them or-

01:17.277 --> 01:19.041
Not now.

01:20.447 --> 01:23.348
<i>G,' [Continues]</i>

01:23.416 --> 01:25.350

01:29.923 --> 01:32.415
<i>Mr. Guerin! True or false?</i>

01:32.492 --> 01:35.621
We're not even a month into the semester,
and you're already failing my class.

01:35.695 --> 01:39.495
- This is a new record. - To be blunt,
World War ll just doesn't do it for me.

01:39.566 --> 01:43.662
Well, try doing this. The 509th Bomb Group
is in town this week for a reunion.

01:43.736 --> 01:46.728
Your biographical account of one
veteran's wartime experience...

01:46.806 --> 01:48.672
will be on my desk by 5:00.

01:48.741 --> 01:53.235
- Old people creep me out.
- Well, then think of them as living history.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.640

01:57.717 --> 02:00.209

02:00.286 --> 02:02.584
Okay, moving on. Uh-

02:02.655 --> 02:05.681
Roswell. How is it different now
than it was back then?

02:05.758 --> 02:09.353
I don't know. I haven't
darkened their door since '47.

02:09.429 --> 02:12.091
- Look, Hal-
- Captain Carver.

02:12.165 --> 02:16.159
Captain Carver.
Let's make this easy.

02:16.236 --> 02:20.230
Why don't you give me a few good details
that I can put in this notebook of mine...

02:20.306 --> 02:23.037
and I'll just copy the rest
out of a book.

02:23.109 --> 02:25.771
When the going gets rough,
resort to plagiarism, huh?

02:25.845 --> 02:28.246
You kids today are softer than soap.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.716

- What'd you just say?

02:42.929 --> 02:45.591
- <i>8-176.</i>
- <i>That'; the Flying Fortress.</i>

02:45.665 --> 02:49.067
- You like planes?
- You could say I was born to fly.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.467
<i>So was I.
That's my picture there.</i>

02:53.173 --> 02:56.768
- So why did you leave in '47?
- Don't you know what happened that year?

02:56.843 --> 02:58.777
[Chuckles]

02:58.845 --> 03:01.815
Aliens crashed.
Humans went bonkers. Yeah.

03:01.881 --> 03:06.819
Thinkyou could've handled that?
You had survivors running loose in the streets.

03:06.886 --> 03:11.551
Sounds terrifying. Four feet tail,
silver suits, no hair? Very scary.

03:11.624 --> 03:14.218
That's what the crackpots that wrote
the books wanted you to believe.

03:14.294 --> 03:17.924
- It's all a bunch of crazy-
- We weren't crazy. We were lied to.

03:17.997 --> 03:20.125
- Whatever.
- Hey, look, kid.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.862
I'm not one of your hoodlum friends.

03:22.936 --> 03:27.737
You better start showing me a little respect,
or I'll kickyour ass through this door.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.079
Well, let me save you the effort.

03:34.147 --> 03:38.106
I'm just gonna take this,
then I'll be out of your hair.

03:38.184 --> 03:40.346
They had black eyes. Empty.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.913

03:45.491 --> 03:48.483
You gonna stand there like

03:48.561 --> 03:50.962
or do you want to learn something?

03:51.030 --> 03:53.192
You're gonna teach me about aliens?

03:56.736 --> 03:58.670
Okay, let's hear it.

04:04.010 --> 04:07.844
These sissies today that complain
about global warming...

04:07.914 --> 04:11.578

<i>You always travel with that thing?</i>

06:30.556 --> 06:33.992

These are press credentials from the Fort

09:14.120 --> 09:17.055
This is a restricted area.
Get her out of here, Deputy Valenti.

09:17.123 --> 09:20.058
<i>Uh-uh. I have permission to be here.
I want some answers.</i>

09:20.126 --> 09:23.061
- George, snap some shots. Snap some shots.
- Get the camera.

Hey! Hey! You put one scratch on that lens,

09:26.799 --> 09:29.291
- Now, Deputy.
- Welcome back from the war, Colonel.

You see that troop truck?

09:53.593 --> 09:56.824
Take it directly to Hangar 20.
No stops, no questions.

09:56.896 --> 09:59.627
I don't care ifa family of four
is bleeding on the roadside.

09:59.699 --> 10:02.361
But Roswell needs all the tourists
it can get, Captain.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.403
Get another man and head out!

10:06.672 --> 10:09.437
<i>I know the rest--
The feds made Marcel the scapegoat...</i>

10:09.508 --> 10:11.670
and blamed the crash
on a weather balloon.

10:11.744 --> 10:14.111
It was all Cavitt's idea,
if I remember correctly.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.342
That pencil neck.
Where'd you hear that?

10:16.415 --> 10:19.316
I've been reading U.F.O.
magazines since I was eight.

10:19.385 --> 10:22.320
So you want to believe.

10:22.388 --> 10:24.789
You shouldn't smoke.

10:24.857 --> 10:29.852
Look, kid, my doctor said it doesn't
make any difference what I do.

10:29.929 --> 10:33.263
Is that why you came back here?

10:33.332 --> 10:38.168
War has a tendency to create
an incredible bond between men.

10:38.237 --> 10:41.901
Some of the best days of my life
were spent right here on this base...

10:41.974 --> 10:44.443
alongside the boys of the 509th.

10:44.510 --> 10:47.844

- <i>Oh!</i>
- <i>[ Michael] Do you still fit into yours?</i>

10:52.251 --> 10:54.743
The longer I sit here...

10:54.820 --> 10:57.517
the harder it is to think
that I could put one on.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.524
Why's that?

10:59.592 --> 11:03.995
Because everything I believed
that uniform stood for died in '47.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.432
Hey-

11:12.571 --> 11:14.505
A little something
from way back when.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.837
You think that reporter's
onto something?

11:21.914 --> 11:24.679
She needs an exclusive,
plain and simple.

11:24.750 --> 11:28.050
<i>Why? You think
she's onto something?</i>

11:28.120 --> 11:31.215
I didn't until an intelligence officer
ordered us to keep our mouths shut.

11:31.290 --> 11:35.557
Forget Cavitt. After Sunday dinner
he probably debriefs his own mother.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.619
I love this country.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.335
What if something's
really out there...

11:42.401 --> 11:44.335

13:25.571 --> 13:28.063
We should've asked what they were.
