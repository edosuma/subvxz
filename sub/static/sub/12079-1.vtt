<i>The following movie is a compilation</i>

00:26.486 --> 00:29.352
<i>of more than 100 hours of
high definition footage,</i>

00:29.353 --> 00:32.075
<i>captured by the British
Society of Cryptozoology.</i>

00:36.040 --> 00:41.549
<i>No images have been altered
or manipulated in any way.</i>

00:47.376 --> 00:53.398
<i>THE DINOSAURS PROJECT</i>

01:05.965 --> 01:09.412
<i>Fear grows, after the disappearance
of a group of explorers</i>

01:09.493 --> 01:12.224
<i>from the British
Society of Cryptozoology.</i>

01:13.494 --> 01:17.617
<i>The biggest concern is that they have
been attacked by a jungle militia.</i>

01:17.737 --> 01:19.719
<i>Although it is still unknown
why the helicopter,</i>

01:19.720 --> 01:22.716
<i>after a three weeks journey,
has lost radio contact.</i>

01:23.723 --> 01:25.676
<i>More news to follow.</i>

01:26.891 --> 01:28.911
<i>You've heard of the Loch-Ness monster,</i>

01:29.032 --> 01:31.450
<i>and of the legendary
North-American Big Foot.</i>

01:31.649 --> 01:36.548
<i>Now, meet Mokele Mbembe,
the African mythical monster.</i>

01:36.583 --> 01:39.853
<i>An ancient creature, who has
been making headlines despite...</i>

01:39.971 --> 01:42.823
<i>Literally, "River Blocker".</i>

01:42.984 --> 01:46.789
<i>Some scientists believe that it fits
with the description of a Plesiosaur,</i>

01:46.908 --> 01:49.998
<i>a prehistoric marine reptile that died
along with the rest of the Dinosaurs.</i>

01:50.159 --> 01:52.534
<i>Although many do not believe
it is something scientific...</i>

01:52.535 --> 01:55.944
<i>It was originally reported by
missionaries over 100 years ago.</i>

01:56.619 --> 02:00.624
<i>There has been some sightings
of the legendary beast for years,</i>

02:00.660 --> 02:02.548
<i>because of the extensive deforestation,</i>

02:02.583 --> 02:05.437
<i>which allows the light to enter
in what was once an impenetrable jungle.</i>

02:17.487 --> 02:21.295
<i>Despite claims of fraud,
the news of sightings are on the rise,</i>

02:21.436 --> 02:25.312
<i>so the Society of Cryptozoology
has formed a group of expeditioners</i>

02:25.546 --> 02:30.269
<i>in the Congolese Jungle,
to investigate the source of the rumors.</i>

02:30.914 --> 02:34.990
<i>As project leader, we have the
internationally renowned explorer</i>

02:35.025 --> 02:36.347
<i>and zoologist Jonathan Marchant.</i>

02:36.382 --> 02:38.240
<i>He was at the head of a group in 2010,</i>

02:38.241 --> 02:41.386
<i>in charge of tracking
the elusive Tasmanian Tiger.</i>

02:41.387 --> 02:45.554
On December 23, 1938, a South
African fisherman, Henry Gooznan,

02:45.677 --> 02:49.484
saw a Coelacanth, believed
extinct for 65 million years.

02:49.726 --> 02:52.579
We, scientists, must have an open mind.

02:52.580 --> 02:55.134
We cannot affirm or deny anything
without accurate information.

02:55.169 --> 02:57.961
If there is something out there,
it is my job to find and observe it.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.624
<i>This is not only because
of the thrill of the hunt.</i>

03:01.329 --> 03:02.390
Sorry.

03:02.791 --> 03:05.133
<i>The Society, which has been
founded in the Victorian time,</i>

03:05.254 --> 03:07.416
<i>looking for animals whose
existence was not yet proven,</i>

03:07.438 --> 03:10.574
<i>did not have many successes.</i>

03:10.626 --> 03:13.770
<i>If there are any shy
Dinosaurs hanging around,</i>

03:13.891 --> 03:15.455
<i>they should seek shelter now,</i>

03:15.456 --> 03:17.419
<i>because the group will be
accompanied by a TV team</i>

03:17.479 --> 03:21.265
<i>With recording devices
of the latest generation.</i>

03:22.870 --> 03:24.212
<i>Care with T-Rex.</i>

03:24.247 --> 03:27.094
Be careful, because there will
be times that we did not hope.

03:31.203 --> 03:33.479
I think this is the camera.

03:36.121 --> 03:38.122
Okay, well.

03:39.603 --> 03:43.240
This is the video diary of
the great Jonathan Marchant.

03:43.922 --> 03:46.722
Hunter of mythical creatures
and action adventurer.

03:47.321 --> 03:49.962
There are Dinosaurs, in all parts.

03:50.323 --> 03:53.362
Beware, because Dad walks with...

03:55.882 --> 03:58.762
Panties. Many.

04:00.882 --> 04:03.002
I'd say there are about 15.

04:03.683 --> 04:06.002
15 pairs of these beautiful panties.

04:06.323 --> 04:11.132
I do not like them much.
They are for English souls.

04:11.522 --> 04:14.801
They are panties,
which tell the Dinausaurs,

04:14.922 --> 04:17.721
do not mess with my Dad.

04:18.442 --> 04:19.642
Lovely.

04:19.803 --> 04:22.041
Of course, the famous hat.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.080
As always.

04:26.323 --> 04:27.561
Let's go!

04:29.681 --> 04:31.242
This is better.

04:33.042 --> 04:34.921
A satellite video phone.

04:41.243 --> 04:43.362
Cannot be.

04:43.563 --> 04:45.800
This is the worst possible time.

04:46.482 --> 04:49.801
Why can't you take care of you,
if it's also your responsibility?

04:50.003 --> 04:52.922
I cannot change my plans, right?

04:55.323 --> 04:56.641
Okay.

04:57.042 --> 04:58.760
Okay, yeah. All right.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.038
What is this?

05:01.401 --> 05:02.962
So what are you playing at?

05:03.123 --> 05:05.400
Some of these things belong
to the television company.

05:05.522 --> 05:06.641
I am going with you?

05:06.802 --> 05:08.320
Thanks to your mom, yes.

05:09.802 --> 05:13.000
But you'll be in the
enclosure, Rachel can take care of you.

05:14.241 --> 05:16.762
Why did they expel you, Luke?

05:18.562 --> 05:21.001
The manager was
controller of the orders.

05:21.082 --> 05:22.440
He deserved it.

05:24.203 --> 05:25.802
You put it on the Internet.

05:39.921 --> 05:41.519
<i>OUTPUTS</i>

05:42.080 --> 05:43.681
- Liz.
- Hello.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.480
Hi, how are you?

05:45.681 --> 05:47.481
Hi. Nice to see you.

05:47.562 --> 05:48.920
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

05:49.041 --> 05:50.641
The camera is my son's.

05:50.803 --> 05:53.001
I'm Liz Draper, I finished...

05:53.721 --> 05:56.960
I finished my Medicine
studies last year.

05:57.441 --> 06:00.760
And I was looking for a
different challenge.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.921
And this, it was definitely different.

06:04.082 --> 06:06.921
What will you do in the
Dinosaurs project?

06:07.322 --> 06:10.480
Well. I'll see to take
good care of those...

06:10.481 --> 06:14.849
who were stung by a snake or a scorpion.

06:14.884 --> 06:16.642
This is enough, thanks.

06:18.522 --> 06:19.401
Luke.

06:20.721 --> 06:22.838
- Something's wrong?
- No.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.318
The red light is on.

06:26.121 --> 06:27.321
Is it?

06:28.440 --> 06:33.041
- Sorry Sir. What do you want?
- Pretzels, please.

06:33.322 --> 06:34.560
Luke, stop.

06:36.001 --> 06:37.600
<i>ARRIVALS</i>

06:43.600 --> 06:46.239
Pete, how do you find local food?

06:51.401 --> 06:53.800
- Hey, Pete?
- Yes.

06:54.482 --> 06:57.720
Would you like to eat,
and I'll help with your luggage?

06:58.400 --> 07:00.320
- Definitely.
- Very well!

07:01.722 --> 07:03.721
- For you.
- For me.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.321
Do not touch the camera.
You know the rules.

07:09.920 --> 07:10.739
I'm sorry.

07:10.780 --> 07:13.959
Sorry? You are not there to strive.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.239
- What do you think, Dad?
- Very cute.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.441
How do you see this?

07:33.081 --> 07:34.880
He will not come, Luke.

07:35.041 --> 07:37.959
But I can be your camera operator
or your engineer.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.559
Think about it.

07:39.802 --> 07:41.760
I have mini cameras.

07:42.161 --> 07:44.179
They are great! They fit in anywhere.

07:44.180 --> 07:46.799
And they send the images to your
hard drive, while you take them.

07:47.001 --> 07:48.398
I have many.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.320
Always being recording.
They film everything, it's great.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.760
Surely a TV company. Have that resolved.

07:58.881 --> 08:00.980
But it would surprise me
if they had this technology,

08:00.981 --> 08:02.079
because it is very modern.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.560
- They are as good as those of the TV.
- You're not coming, right?

08:05.721 --> 08:07.960
- You would never let me go.
- I have everything ready.

08:08.041 --> 08:11.019
Make sure you're ready, because your
aunt comes to pick you up at 4:00 PM.

08:17.321 --> 08:18.519
Okay.

08:21.721 --> 08:23.880
I hope your Aunt Rachel is here soon.

08:25.201 --> 08:26.878
See you in a couple of weeks.

08:31.318 --> 08:33.039
Do not do anything stupid.

08:34.001 --> 08:35.679
Okay. Goodbye Daddy.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.918
Hello. Nice to meet you.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.719
Sound is ready?

09:26.759 --> 09:28.719
Could you introduce yourself, please?

09:29.040 --> 09:30.479
My name is Omara.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.118
And this is Ethien, our pilot.

09:33.280 --> 09:36.520
Ethien and I worked for the
Environment Agency in Congo.

09:36.681 --> 09:40.358
So we are both
passionate about conservatism.

09:45.039 --> 09:46.559
I'm sorry.

09:47.401 --> 09:49.279
- We do it again?
- Of course.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.399
Prehistoric monsters!

09:51.680 --> 09:53.559
I'm not sure about that.

09:54.079 --> 09:57.918
My job is to ensure that the
team reaches the jungle safely.

09:58.238 --> 10:01.917
And to make sure they do not
harm the forest habitat.

10:02.278 --> 10:04.078
I'm Charlie Rutherford.

10:04.238 --> 10:07.600
I've been with Jonathan,
in all expeditions.

10:07.761 --> 10:09.599
I guess I can say...

10:09.720 --> 10:11.678
that I'm his right hand.

10:11.839 --> 10:13.758
To be honest. We do everything together.

10:14.199 --> 10:16.299
I have always been there with Jonathan,

10:16.300 --> 10:18.952
along with the discoveries we have made.
I have always been there.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.317
Things are as they are.

10:24.558 --> 10:28.437
I organize sponsorship and
Jonathan is the public figure.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.780
He definitely prefers the opposite,
but that's what you get,

10:31.781 --> 10:33.599
being the best at what you do.

10:40.839 --> 10:42.398
Let's do this.

10:43.238 --> 10:44.438
All set.

10:44.799 --> 10:46.357
Excited?

10:47.159 --> 10:48.479
Here we go.

11:35.519 --> 11:37.158
Heavens!

11:37.319 --> 11:39.158
This is absolutely amazing.

11:42.078 --> 11:43.919
This is a Plesiosaur.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.918
This is an Ichthyosaur.

11:46.079 --> 11:50.157
Both sure lived in deep waters,
in rivers 300 feet deep or more.

11:50.278 --> 11:53.478
And together the are
consistently found in fossils.

11:53.639 --> 11:56.597
Yes it is a Plesiosaur...
It's like a furry cat.

11:56.718 --> 11:58.997
There is nothing to worry about.

11:59.117 --> 12:00.677
But his cousin...

12:00.838 --> 12:02.235
Is evil.

12:02.397 --> 12:04.176
There is a wide range of possibilities,

12:04.298 --> 12:07.797
that Mokele is a distant descendant
of one of these animals.

12:08.558 --> 12:11.277
And it is just a myth, of course.

12:11.639 --> 12:14.116
You don't think it's possible?

12:15.078 --> 12:17.797
It is the African monster of Loch Ness.

12:17.958 --> 12:19.958
But much more plausible.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.077
It stinks in here.

12:35.278 --> 12:37.078
Smells like petrol.

12:37.999 --> 12:39.757
Or feet.

12:41.078 --> 12:44.396
First time I'm in a helicopter and I'm
in the cupboard.

12:44.557 --> 12:46.356
This is great.

12:46.597 --> 12:48.437
Now I've been flying...

12:48.798 --> 12:50.116
Well...

12:51.117 --> 12:52.636
Like 90 minutes?

12:53.317 --> 12:54.798
I don't know how much longer...

12:56.279 --> 12:57.556
What was that?

13:05.117 --> 13:08.479
You put yourself and others at risk,
don't you see?

13:08.680 --> 13:12.556
What if the helicopter gets in
troubles? You're not even tied in!

13:13.957 --> 13:16.476
If the helicopter falls, we all die.

13:16.597 --> 13:18.117
That's not the point.

13:18.279 --> 13:20.158
I knew this would be a problem.

13:20.439 --> 13:22.878
We must return there, to take him back.

13:22.999 --> 13:24.036
I can't.

13:24.197 --> 13:26.955
We passed the limit, not enough fuel.

13:30.797 --> 13:33.997
- What shall I do with you?
- Calm down, Jonathan.

13:34.358 --> 13:36.717
He wanted to come on the expedition.

13:36.878 --> 13:38.556
You can't blame him, right?

13:39.358 --> 13:42.234
Okay, when we land, you get off.

13:44.278 --> 13:46.876
Meanwhile you sit there and
do not touch anything.

13:57.598 --> 13:58.877
Luke.

13:59.078 --> 14:00.517
Sit.

14:13.837 --> 14:16.234
Omara, what's that down there?

14:16.396 --> 14:19.116
It is a traditional
village, Wootie town.

14:22.078 --> 14:23.476
What are they?

14:25.798 --> 14:27.756
Charlie, who are they?

14:29.556 --> 14:30.995
Not sure.

14:32.237 --> 14:33.958
They look strange.

14:34.239 --> 14:35.998
They don't fly like birds.

14:38.357 --> 14:40.517
Omara, what kind of birds are those?

14:45.516 --> 14:46.716
Omara?

14:51.196 --> 14:52.555
Ethien!

14:57.317 --> 14:58.636
Captain!

15:03.118 --> 15:04.476
Beware!

15:11.557 --> 15:13.515
We fall.

15:15.038 --> 15:17.236
Seriously, we fall.

15:18.677 --> 15:20.756
We hit an animal.

15:22.197 --> 15:23.636
Luke.

16:02.955 --> 16:04.436
Luke.

16:11.356 --> 16:13.035
- Johnny, are you okay?
- Yes.

16:13.156 --> 16:14.395
Take the bags and leave.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.113
Take the bags and leave.

16:17.315 --> 16:18.515
Ethien.

16:19.117 --> 16:20.916
Luke, get out.

16:21.877 --> 16:24.434
There's fuel leaking.

16:25.876 --> 16:27.796
Luke, get out!

16:28.197 --> 16:29.594
Get out!

16:30.835 --> 16:32.555
Charlie, help me with the equipment.

16:32.756 --> 16:34.036
Pete, get him out of here.

16:34.277 --> 16:35.396
He got caught.

16:35.517 --> 16:36.716
Take cover, everyone.

16:37.356 --> 16:38.395
Move.

16:38.596 --> 16:39.636
Charlie.

16:39.797 --> 16:41.276
Wait, my equipment.

16:41.437 --> 16:42.715
The hard drives.

16:42.876 --> 16:44.154
Luke, no!

16:44.435 --> 16:45.635
Luke, leave them.

16:47.796 --> 16:49.237
Luke, let's go.

16:49.398 --> 16:51.235
Sal, let's go.

16:51.396 --> 16:52.674
Luke, move.

16:53.315 --> 16:54.475
Let's go.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.474
Luke, beware!

16:58.835 --> 16:59.755
Let's go.

17:02.316 --> 17:03.434
Let's go, Luke.

17:06.954 --> 17:07.954
No.

17:09.516 --> 17:10.636
Oh my God!

17:10.837 --> 17:12.075
Oh my God!

17:12.556 --> 17:13.714
Oh my God!

17:14.355 --> 17:16.273
You will start listening
to me, understand?

17:16.674 --> 17:18.354
I need these cameras.

17:18.473 --> 17:19.913
Do not put...

17:20.075 --> 17:22.915
Do not put anyone's life in danger
in this crew, including you.

17:22.997 --> 17:24.396
Is that clear?

17:35.916 --> 17:38.395
Someone just died there.
Turn that thing off!

17:49.796 --> 17:51.115
What the hell were those things?

17:51.476 --> 17:53.316
They definitely did not seem like birds.

17:53.516 --> 17:56.912
They were jungle hawks, with
15 meters wings.

17:57.595 --> 17:59.834
Planes always crash over here.

18:00.715 --> 18:01.714
OK?

18:03.955 --> 18:04.915
Okay.

18:11.915 --> 18:15.234
We have to seek refuge in this village.

18:16.835 --> 18:17.953
Omara, which way?

18:19.156 --> 18:20.474
We cross the river.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.194
Did you hear that?

18:52.755 --> 18:54.234
What is it?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.193
I've seen something.

18:59.714 --> 19:02.753
Let's go.
I will not lose anyone else tonight.

19:03.194 --> 19:04.873
Right, Your Majesty.

19:51.355 --> 19:53.073
What happened here?

20:00.994 --> 20:02.073
No!

20:02.154 --> 20:03.832
It's not possible.

20:08.673 --> 20:10.193
What happens?

20:10.714 --> 20:11.835
Nothing.

20:12.516 --> 20:13.635
Nothing.

20:15.114 --> 20:16.592
Everything's OK.

20:17.433 --> 20:18.553
Everything's OK.

20:24.034 --> 20:26.634
The sun will set
in less than an hour, we should go.

20:41.435 --> 20:42.672
Give me a light.

20:53.915 --> 20:55.193
Don't look.

20:56.394 --> 20:57.792
Okay, Dad.

20:58.713 --> 21:01.033
- What was that?
- Some tribal cult.

21:02.115 --> 21:03.911
Omara, what do you think?

21:05.434 --> 21:07.353
I don't think we should stay here.

21:07.435 --> 21:09.032
The weather is getting bad.

21:09.113 --> 21:10.991
We'll have to find another hut.

21:14.393 --> 21:15.713
This looks good.

21:16.074 --> 21:17.671
We can stay here.

21:20.074 --> 21:21.833
Well, I have no choice.

21:28.673 --> 21:31.272
- What is it?
- Ii is a motion detector.

21:32.233 --> 21:33.952
- Pete, ready?
- Yes.

21:34.713 --> 21:35.913
Re-lighting.

21:43.913 --> 21:45.033
How thoughtful!

21:45.273 --> 21:47.191
It will film when it
feels some movement.

21:47.552 --> 21:48.632
Good thinking!

21:48.833 --> 21:50.433
- Luke, stop that.
- One moment.

21:50.673 --> 21:51.873
This is getting dark.

21:51.994 --> 21:52.912
Leave it.

21:53.194 --> 21:54.413
If there's anybody out there,

21:54.414 --> 21:56.792
don't you think it would be good
to know that they are here?

22:01.753 --> 22:02.871
A smart kid.

22:06.674 --> 22:07.832
Not so bad.

22:08.513 --> 22:10.112
There is a lot of food.

22:10.313 --> 22:12.192
Most of it, thanks to Pete.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.992
We can go to the crash
site in the morning,

22:15.993 --> 22:17.952
but if we spend a few days here,

22:18.074 --> 22:19.433
we can hunt.

22:19.554 --> 22:21.592
They will pick us up before, right?

22:22.313 --> 22:25.232
We don't know if
Ethien has sent an alarm signal or not.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.592
The radio shut off before the impact.

22:27.713 --> 22:29.432
What about the other cameras?

22:29.552 --> 22:31.431
- And does the satellite phone work?
- No.

22:31.552 --> 22:34.271
I think it was ruined in the accident.

22:34.993 --> 22:36.911
Why not give it to Luke?

22:37.074 --> 22:39.592
He knows more about these
things than any of us.

22:41.833 --> 22:43.471
I will do my best.

22:43.792 --> 22:45.511
Although I don't guarantee anything.

22:52.312 --> 22:53.872
Okay, then...

22:57.152 --> 23:00.673
I think we can count some days,
before they rescue us...

23:00.795 --> 23:04.391
or we get to safe harbor.

23:04.472 --> 23:06.271
Try to sleep.

23:24.112 --> 23:27.272
I don't think anyone can
sleep with this noise.

23:33.311 --> 23:34.950
Pete, by the way...

23:36.433 --> 23:39.671
if you throw any other flatulence,
I'll kick you outside.

24:32.352 --> 24:33.271
Pete.

24:37.792 --> 24:38.791
Pete?

24:41.032 --> 24:42.431
Now what did I do?

24:43.431 --> 24:44.591
Listen.

24:52.432 --> 24:54.271
What the hell is that?

24:54.833 --> 24:55.752
Luke.

24:57.752 --> 24:58.750
Luke.

25:13.270 --> 25:14.471
Heaven.

26:07.111 --> 26:08.510
Hold a light.

26:29.111 --> 26:30.031
See.

26:30.511 --> 26:31.590
See.

26:32.312 --> 26:33.590
Get out.

26:34.391 --> 26:35.709
Run!

26:36.391 --> 26:37.430
Run!

26:37.830 --> 26:39.071
Get out.

26:39.992 --> 26:41.711
Everybody out.

26:42.871 --> 26:44.509
We're leaving.

26:48.630 --> 26:51.150
Come on, move. We have
to reach the river.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.471
- Get up.
- I'm fine. Let's go.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.109
The boat!

27:00.630 --> 27:01.669
The boat.

27:03.352 --> 27:04.510
Get on.

27:06.271 --> 27:07.391
Get on.

27:08.152 --> 27:09.589
Wait, Dad.

27:10.190 --> 27:11.389
Where is Dad?

27:11.751 --> 27:12.870
Dad!

27:13.950 --> 27:14.990
Hurry!

27:16.112 --> 27:17.191
Run.

27:17.871 --> 27:18.989
Let's go!

27:19.590 --> 27:20.629
Move!

27:20.790 --> 27:22.110
Where is Liz?

27:23.750 --> 27:25.149
Jonathan, where is Liz?

27:27.310 --> 27:28.630
Killed.

27:29.191 --> 27:29.950
What?

28:11.271 --> 28:14.187
Now we are adrift.

28:19.070 --> 28:23.349
Dad the captain thought, which
is the best way to rescue us.

28:30.469 --> 28:32.668
This is the best chance we have.

28:32.790 --> 28:35.028
We need to seek shelter.

28:35.149 --> 28:38.366
If we meet someone, it
will be right here.

28:39.430 --> 28:42.309
Last night we were attacked,
in an abandoned village.

28:45.588 --> 28:46.829
Liz...

28:52.150 --> 28:54.149
Liz... she's gone.

29:01.030 --> 29:03.468
Charlie recognized what hit us.

29:05.709 --> 29:08.750
May be, some kind of dinosaur.

29:14.430 --> 29:15.468
Omara...

29:20.309 --> 29:22.670
says he has never seen
anything like this before.

29:24.350 --> 29:25.948
I guess the mission is finished.

29:27.269 --> 29:28.989
We're stranded here.

29:38.189 --> 29:40.308
Charlie has been talking to me.

29:42.231 --> 29:44.548
There's more, of what
the others have done.

29:46.029 --> 29:47.147
Like Dad.

29:51.310 --> 29:52.710
That will be all.

29:57.269 --> 29:58.628
Liz, rest in peace.

30:24.348 --> 30:25.148
Okay.

30:26.629 --> 30:27.787
Sure.

30:34.590 --> 30:36.187
Did you progress with that?

30:43.350 --> 30:45.149
I had no idea that...

30:45.990 --> 30:47.949
you would bring that sort of things.

30:48.189 --> 30:50.986
Expeditions can take a long time.

30:51.907 --> 30:53.147
True.

31:00.189 --> 31:02.147
Did you know that you are
very popular in Japan?

31:05.267 --> 31:07.389
There are many fun websites.

31:10.149 --> 31:12.467
How do you think I knew what you did?

31:21.389 --> 31:22.468
What happens?

31:22.789 --> 31:23.828
Did you see that?

31:23.989 --> 31:24.828
What?

31:25.070 --> 31:25.949
What was that?

31:26.109 --> 31:27.227
In the trees.

31:27.428 --> 31:29.068
- Don't you see?
- Where?

31:29.950 --> 31:31.108
They are everywhere.

31:32.188 --> 31:34.466
Leaves, Pete. That's what they are.

31:36.308 --> 31:37.228
It's nothing.

31:37.869 --> 31:38.748
There!

31:39.229 --> 31:39.946
There!

31:41.507 --> 31:42.748
Oh my God, yes!

31:43.109 --> 31:44.547
See, I told you.

31:44.668 --> 31:46.027
They are tracking us.

31:46.748 --> 31:48.107
It could be anything.

31:52.908 --> 31:54.387
What the hell was that?

31:59.709 --> 32:01.267
There's something in there!

32:01.468 --> 32:02.746
Wait.

32:02.987 --> 32:04.147
Wait.

32:08.749 --> 32:10.429
Pete, there are rocks.

32:14.588 --> 32:16.105
Beware!

32:24.748 --> 32:26.667
Broke the pot.

32:27.228 --> 32:28.587
Devils!

32:28.988 --> 32:30.587
Keep your head down.

32:37.188 --> 32:38.747
Can you tell us what's going on?

32:38.869 --> 32:41.208
We lost one of the boats and
they are repairing the hole.

32:43.028 --> 32:44.826
Can you describe what
you saw in the water?

32:45.267 --> 32:46.227
What?

32:46.588 --> 32:49.507
- What was out there.
- Out there, there's nothing!

32:51.907 --> 32:54.148
How long will we stay on this island?

32:54.309 --> 32:57.027
We hope to leave in the morning.

32:57.706 --> 32:59.545
- I'm finished.
- Jonathan...

32:59.747 --> 33:01.066
Are we safe here?

33:23.228 --> 33:25.706
You really bought cards
with images of dinosaurs?

33:46.747 --> 33:48.626
It seems that was your mom.

33:52.827 --> 33:54.226
We've eaten worse.

33:57.868 --> 33:58.867
In fact...

34:06.107 --> 34:08.505
- What was that?
- That was big.

34:09.187 --> 34:10.786
Maybe a leopard.

34:11.547 --> 34:14.067
- Just hunting.
- This is what happens in the Jungle.

34:15.067 --> 34:16.866
We're safe here on the island.

34:22.264 --> 34:23.585
I can ask you something?

34:27.906 --> 34:30.264
I'm as scared as you are...

34:31.467 --> 34:33.426
What do you think are these things?

34:34.867 --> 34:36.344
I'm not sure.

34:37.025 --> 34:39.147
I never heard that the
attacked like this before.

34:43.146 --> 34:44.824
What did you hear exactly?

34:48.467 --> 34:51.905
For years, there have
been stories of attacks.

34:54.346 --> 34:56.347
Sightings of strange animals.

34:56.467 --> 34:59.587
Local leaders believe this is because
of the program of local deforestation.

35:04.025 --> 35:07.705
They believe that the demons fled
farther and farther from their homes.

35:11.466 --> 35:12.625
Their home?

35:13.586 --> 35:15.346
Obobo means Door.

35:15.786 --> 35:18.025
This is folklore. It's just a myth.

35:19.264 --> 35:20.704
A Door.

35:22.426 --> 35:24.146
What is there on the other side?

35:24.347 --> 35:26.505
A lot of the village men
have gone to find out.

35:27.546 --> 35:28.867
None has returned.

35:29.867 --> 35:31.066
Not one.

35:38.467 --> 35:40.686
- It was not supposed to come here.
- What do you mean?

35:48.384 --> 35:49.825
What was that?

35:53.746 --> 35:55.545
Dave, if you miss a round...

36:00.186 --> 36:02.144
Heaven! What's that?

36:04.666 --> 36:05.744
It's impossible.

36:06.185 --> 36:07.504
Look, there are more of them.

36:08.306 --> 36:09.666
What are they?

36:13.266 --> 36:14.664
Dilophosaurs.

36:15.305 --> 36:17.585
- You are sure.
- No, I'm assuming.

36:18.026 --> 36:19.904
What the hell is this?

36:21.347 --> 36:23.027
Do you like sweet?

36:23.507 --> 36:24.946
What are you doing?

36:26.707 --> 36:27.864
Come here.

36:29.624 --> 36:31.625
Do not be stupid Luke,
you'll lose a finger.

36:33.666 --> 36:36.185
Listen, we don't know how they react.

36:36.346 --> 36:37.543
Come.

36:38.025 --> 36:39.225
Good boy!

36:40.066 --> 36:40.985
Come.

36:44.866 --> 36:45.785
Luke.

36:55.146 --> 36:56.504
That cute!

36:56.946 --> 36:58.105
Look at him.

37:13.144 --> 37:14.385
Luke.

37:18.024 --> 37:19.223
Cheers!

37:19.664 --> 37:20.783
Stinks.

37:21.065 --> 37:22.424
Doesn't smell good.

38:18.706 --> 38:20.982
We gotta go. Now.

38:21.984 --> 38:24.465
Those who saw last night, were babies.

38:25.106 --> 38:28.625
What if the babies come with
others which are not so friendly?

38:34.823 --> 38:37.622
You said last night that they were
not supposed to come here.

38:37.824 --> 38:39.384
Isn't it obvious?

38:39.625 --> 38:41.464
Don't you remember the
village over there?

38:41.665 --> 38:42.904
We are not safe here.

38:44.024 --> 38:47.184
Jonathan... We gotta go. Now!

39:05.304 --> 39:07.623
It is not safe anymore
to be on the island.

39:08.625 --> 39:10.625
I think, they're just playing
, basically.

39:13.546 --> 39:14.545
Look.

39:29.744 --> 39:31.703
But the best is this.

39:38.063 --> 39:39.743
I call it Crypto.

39:40.224 --> 39:41.705
I think he likes me.

39:45.065 --> 39:46.143
Let's go Crypto.

39:49.465 --> 39:50.543
Good boy.

39:52.064 --> 39:52.903
Come.

39:56.305 --> 39:57.184
Come.

40:00.143 --> 40:00.943
Good.

40:01.023 --> 40:03.583
We will discover why they
disappeared last night.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.222
How? They will ask.

40:06.743 --> 40:07.822
With this.

40:10.945 --> 40:12.104
Give me the camera!

40:12.946 --> 40:14.223
Right.

40:23.744 --> 40:24.625
There.

40:40.944 --> 40:42.861
It's me.

40:43.302 --> 40:45.462
That will not hurt, right?

40:46.583 --> 40:47.983
Good boy.

40:48.304 --> 40:49.862
Excellent work.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.583
Pete, come and see this!

41:13.783 --> 41:14.903
See.

41:16.465 --> 41:18.023
Watch this.

41:23.823 --> 41:25.701
Omara. Where are you going?

41:25.862 --> 41:27.543
I will not look at this.

41:28.584 --> 41:30.902
- How far is that?
- About 2 miles.

41:31.903 --> 41:33.501
We put a camera on the Dinosaur.

41:35.142 --> 41:36.582
What will they do?

41:43.224 --> 41:44.902
They jump out of the water.

41:51.344 --> 41:52.861
They're fast.

41:53.781 --> 41:55.261
How come?

41:55.383 --> 41:57.422
They're 65 million years old.

42:08.862 --> 42:09.863
What is it?

42:09.984 --> 42:11.942
It is a totem. A tribal warning.

42:35.261 --> 42:36.822
Damn, what happened?

42:37.223 --> 42:39.781
I believe the camera must
have lost the transmission.

42:39.983 --> 42:42.382
Come on, didn't you
say this was working?

42:42.623 --> 42:44.062
Calm down Charlie.

42:44.663 --> 42:45.823
I'm sorry!

42:46.463 --> 42:47.901
They went downstream.

42:48.622 --> 42:50.260
They can't be that far away.

42:50.581 --> 42:53.621
True. This cave must be East from here.

42:53.781 --> 42:55.780
We could easily get there in the boat.

42:55.982 --> 42:57.501
That will not happen.

42:57.662 --> 42:59.142
I'm packing. We're going!

42:59.383 --> 43:00.422
What?

43:00.663 --> 43:01.823
What the hell?...

43:01.984 --> 43:03.901
When will you listen to me?
We're not safe here.

43:03.902 --> 43:05.779
She's right, Charlie.

43:05.901 --> 43:08.581
We have no idea of the
ground below the cave.

43:08.742 --> 43:11.341
We will follow the plan, we go
down the river, meet other people.

43:11.462 --> 43:13.584
Arrange the boat, we go
back and do it properly.

43:13.745 --> 43:15.743
Do you have any idea how big this is?

43:17.662 --> 43:19.180
There are Dinosaurs there.

43:19.821 --> 43:21.221
More than the ones we saw.

43:21.422 --> 43:24.823
Evolutionary mutations,
the ones anyone would dream about!

43:25.144 --> 43:26.943
I want this as much as you want...

43:27.104 --> 43:29.741
So you'll let someone
else get the glory?

43:30.781 --> 43:31.740
Glory.

43:32.140 --> 43:34.180
I already lost two people on this trip.

43:34.582 --> 43:36.700
I have to take care of
a child of 15 years.

43:36.802 --> 43:39.061
A rookie to whom I have
to teach everything.

43:39.062 --> 43:40.262
Is that why you don't take me?

43:40.263 --> 43:41.962
Because I'm not good
enough to go with you?

43:42.382 --> 43:44.261
Daddy, why do you always do this?

43:44.623 --> 43:47.300
I did not ask you to put a
camera in one of those animals.

43:47.461 --> 43:50.221
Maybe you're jealous,
because the rookie is exploring...

43:50.342 --> 43:52.581
instead of giving orders to the others.

43:52.702 --> 43:54.941
- Get out!
- Luke, it is very dangerous!

43:55.142 --> 43:56.342
Okay.

43:56.503 --> 43:58.022
I understand.

44:01.462 --> 44:03.302
Luke, I think you're right.

44:04.102 --> 44:05.542
Stay out of this.

44:40.183 --> 44:41.302
It works again.

45:06.741 --> 45:08.701
They seem to know where they're going.

45:09.022 --> 45:10.541
They follow a trail.

45:11.101 --> 45:12.699
Yes, a game trail.

45:13.141 --> 45:14.381
They must use it a lot.

46:11.301 --> 46:12.661
See that, right?

46:13.742 --> 46:15.101
There are more of them.

46:15.542 --> 46:17.540
This is the Door.

46:19.860 --> 46:21.818
- I have to tell Dad.
- No, no, no!

46:23.100 --> 46:25.740
What do you think your
Dad will do, if we tell him?

46:28.341 --> 46:32.020
He will start to sermon us,
to dissuade us.

46:34.220 --> 46:37.058
Why not leave it 'til a better time?

46:38.941 --> 46:40.981
For when we return to the base.

46:43.461 --> 46:45.581
If you say this at the right time...

46:45.701 --> 46:48.819
you'll have a place back
in the team, guaranteed.

46:52.861 --> 46:53.779
OK?

47:07.621 --> 47:09.338
Only you care, buddy.

47:18.460 --> 47:20.259
White water up ahead.

47:22.619 --> 47:24.338
It will a bit bumpy.

47:36.980 --> 47:38.258
Hold on.

47:38.620 --> 47:40.019
Let's keep the boat straight.

47:40.380 --> 47:42.020
Charlie, take care of the stern.

47:54.019 --> 47:55.540
Keep pulling.

47:56.141 --> 47:57.980
- Keep pulling.
- I'm pulling.

48:11.421 --> 48:13.257
We should go to the left.

48:13.659 --> 48:15.178
Water is coming in.

48:17.620 --> 48:19.820
Jonathan, secure the other boat!

48:23.299 --> 48:24.219
Luke!

48:28.258 --> 48:29.299
Luke!

48:29.778 --> 48:30.899
Dad!

48:37.299 --> 48:39.256
Hang on and keep the head down.

48:47.220 --> 48:48.378
Charlie!

48:52.500 --> 48:53.939
Down!

48:55.419 --> 48:56.578
What are you doing?

48:58.339 --> 48:59.739
Heaven.

49:12.019 --> 49:14.099
We must go back.

49:14.659 --> 49:16.579
Jonathan, we will not manage.

49:18.459 --> 49:21.058
Maybe we should go back
to the rescue team.

49:21.820 --> 49:23.299
With a helicopter.

49:24.058 --> 49:25.497
I won't leave you here.

49:31.619 --> 49:32.777
Let's go!

50:34.538 --> 50:35.775
Where are we?

50:42.699 --> 50:43.818
The water is cold.

50:48.658 --> 50:50.016
Is that bad?

50:52.338 --> 50:55.577
It means it is deep, very deep.

51:02.977 --> 51:05.217
These dinosaurs must
have taken a shortcut.

51:06.379 --> 51:07.738
We should follow.

51:09.019 --> 51:11.017
We have to use our hands to paddle.

51:50.379 --> 51:51.578
Luke!

51:54.937 --> 51:55.897
Dad.

51:56.659 --> 51:58.337
Dad, we're here!

51:58.617 --> 52:00.256
Stay there.

52:02.938 --> 52:04.417
We come to you, Luke.

52:10.858 --> 52:12.138
Yes, Pete, take this.

52:14.578 --> 52:15.896
You came back.

52:25.978 --> 52:27.097
Heaven.

52:38.537 --> 52:39.775
Sit down.

52:40.256 --> 52:41.456
What happened?

52:42.016 --> 52:43.816
The rope must have been damaged.

52:44.418 --> 52:45.857
It is a clean cut.

52:48.256 --> 52:49.956
How's going the fix of
the satellite phone?

52:50.816 --> 52:53.577
I have to fix a couple of
connections and I think it will work.

52:53.738 --> 52:54.858
Okay.

52:55.737 --> 52:56.736
Okay.

52:58.538 --> 53:00.056
We need to find land.

53:01.897 --> 53:03.255
Let's paddle.

53:10.616 --> 53:11.976
Paddle.

53:12.738 --> 53:13.896
Paddle.

53:14.818 --> 53:15.857
Come.

53:18.977 --> 53:20.017
Come.

53:25.616 --> 53:27.376
There's something beneath us.

53:39.616 --> 53:40.574
Sit down.

53:52.656 --> 53:53.774
There.

53:57.819 --> 53:59.016
Oh dear!

54:02.457 --> 54:04.015
This is Mokele Mbembe.

54:09.337 --> 54:10.775
It's not aggressive.

54:11.297 --> 54:12.696
Remain calm.

54:13.337 --> 54:14.415
Let me pass.

54:19.937 --> 54:21.175
Care, Dave.

54:22.056 --> 54:24.416
You sure this is not the bad kind?

54:27.576 --> 54:28.936
Easy, guy.

54:34.696 --> 54:35.975
Dave, look out!

54:44.897 --> 54:45.976
Dave!

54:47.497 --> 54:49.215
Get in the boat.

54:49.496 --> 54:50.695
Dad!

54:56.857 --> 54:58.375
Daddy, help me!

54:58.737 --> 54:59.977
Dad!

55:04.216 --> 55:05.055
Dad!

55:17.096 --> 55:18.015
Dad!

55:21.297 --> 55:22.376
Dad!

55:47.936 --> 55:49.295
Dad!

55:49.856 --> 55:51.135
Dad!

55:53.976 --> 55:57.057
You have to get away from here.
We are not safe.

55:57.178 --> 55:58.774
Dad!

56:00.695 --> 56:02.175
Dad!

56:02.296 --> 56:03.816
He's gone.

56:03.937 --> 56:05.494
All dead.

56:07.015 --> 56:08.054
Everyone is dead.

56:24.976 --> 56:26.095
Caution.

56:30.296 --> 56:31.655
Where do we go?

56:34.296 --> 56:36.095
You have to make this work, right?

56:43.774 --> 56:45.177
Charlie!

56:45.377 --> 56:46.815
Charlie, wait!

56:48.376 --> 56:51.073
- Charlie, I can not follow your steps!
- You have to keep moving.

56:51.094 --> 56:53.253
How's it going with the satellite phone?

57:03.694 --> 57:04.733
Okay.

57:06.135 --> 57:07.135
Okay.

57:13.296 --> 57:14.734
Let's go.

57:14.935 --> 57:16.174
Let's go.

57:20.736 --> 57:21.855
Fixed it.

57:24.375 --> 57:25.534
Charlie?

57:28.056 --> 57:29.014
Charlie!

57:33.335 --> 57:34.775
I found it.

57:36.695 --> 57:37.934
Let's go.

57:54.533 --> 57:55.533
Let's go.

57:57.014 --> 57:57.974
Charlie!

57:59.416 --> 58:01.095
- Charlie!
- Let's go.

58:16.255 --> 58:17.454
Charlie!

58:28.815 --> 58:29.813
I...

58:31.776 --> 58:34.333
- I fixed the phone.
- Great!

58:36.654 --> 58:38.093
It's fantastic.

58:41.775 --> 58:43.334
Good job, buddy.

58:44.536 --> 58:45.574
Charlie!

01:00:22.733 --> 01:00:27.292
I don't know whether this is
the high price I have to pay.

01:00:32.173 --> 01:00:33.932
I think I went through the entrance.

01:00:35.293 --> 01:00:37.173
I went through a hole in the ground.

01:00:39.415 --> 01:00:40.812
Some kind of cave.

01:00:42.212 --> 01:00:43.332
Charlie...

01:00:51.855 --> 01:00:54.012
Charlie pushed me...

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:58.493
and tried to kill me.

01:01:01.814 --> 01:01:03.212
Please...

01:01:04.573 --> 01:01:07.331
Please, I don't know if
there was anyone out there.

01:01:11.213 --> 01:01:12.532
Is there anybody there?

01:01:46.052 --> 01:01:47.932
The sound still works, Dave.

01:01:48.653 --> 01:01:49.692
Luke!

01:01:50.333 --> 01:01:51.292
Luke!

01:01:54.493 --> 01:01:57.171
Luke, we're here.

01:01:58.612 --> 01:02:00.652
Jonathan, he is dead.

01:02:01.012 --> 01:02:02.133
You don't know.

01:02:02.294 --> 01:02:04.413
Believe me, where they went,
they will no come back.

01:02:04.494 --> 01:02:05.771
Did you see it?

01:02:06.692 --> 01:02:07.971
It's with Charlie.

01:02:09.133 --> 01:02:10.491
Where, Omara?

01:02:10.932 --> 01:02:12.251
At the door.

01:02:12.693 --> 01:02:14.213
It's In upland.

01:02:15.253 --> 01:02:16.373
I can track them.

01:02:16.574 --> 01:02:19.132
No, it was not supposed to come here.

01:02:19.572 --> 01:02:21.651
You knew this place.

01:02:21.772 --> 01:02:23.852
You should never have come here.

01:02:23.973 --> 01:02:26.451
I had to take you to a part of
safe jungle for you to film...

01:02:26.512 --> 01:02:28.050
and then hop on a plane home.

01:02:29.572 --> 01:02:31.372
It was supposed to be easy.

01:02:32.452 --> 01:02:34.771
You under-estimated this
jungle, we all did.

01:02:35.132 --> 01:02:36.732
Will you come back?

01:02:37.092 --> 01:02:40.411
I will not risk going in a place,
where we have no right to be.

01:02:43.011 --> 01:02:44.573
Sorry Jonathan.

01:02:46.293 --> 01:02:49.252
I regret all what happened.
Sorry about Luke.

01:02:51.212 --> 01:02:52.891
But now you're on your own.

01:02:56.012 --> 01:02:57.571
Pete?

01:03:02.013 --> 01:03:03.531
I'll go with you Jonathan.

01:03:10.371 --> 01:03:11.650
You'll get help.

01:03:15.493 --> 01:03:16.531
Let's go Pete.

01:03:17.332 --> 01:03:18.490
Let's find my son.

01:03:30.132 --> 01:03:31.170
Dad...

01:03:32.531 --> 01:03:33.851
If you are still there...

01:03:35.372 --> 01:03:36.531
I'm sorry.

01:03:40.453 --> 01:03:44.011
I wouldn't be here anymore,
if not for you.

01:03:44.771 --> 01:03:48.491
I just wanted to say that I'm glad
that we came together on this trip.

01:03:51.412 --> 01:03:54.090
Things never end as supposed.

01:03:55.451 --> 01:03:56.850
So thanks.

01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:13.851
Crypto.

01:04:18.292 --> 01:04:19.732
I'm glad to see you!

01:04:19.893 --> 01:04:21.250
Hello boy.

01:04:24.892 --> 01:04:26.051
What happens?

01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:50.090
No, no.

01:04:53.852 --> 01:04:55.530
No, no, no.

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.089
No.

01:05:02.052 --> 01:05:03.771
No, no.

01:05:16.971 --> 01:05:18.370
Please.

01:05:19.491 --> 01:05:21.770
I love animals.

01:05:29.531 --> 01:05:30.490
Luke!

01:05:31.531 --> 01:05:33.811
- Dad!
- I thought I'd lost you.

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:37.648
- They won't get away with it.
- Pete.

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:40.290
Get out.

01:05:40.891 --> 01:05:43.490
- This is for Dave.
- Pete!

01:05:49.092 --> 01:05:50.571
Let's go vermins!

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:52.529
Come here.

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:55.809
Dave, see how they run...

01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:08.089
Where are they? Come.

01:06:14.491 --> 01:06:15.572
Okay.

01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:27.170
Keep moving Luke.

01:06:30.132 --> 01:06:31.051
Keep on.

01:06:31.331 --> 01:06:32.810
Follow Luke.

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:36.729
- Dad, stop.
- Are you okay?

01:06:42.489 --> 01:06:44.049
I found the entrance.

01:06:44.491 --> 01:06:46.489
Charlie, it has always been like this.

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:49.728
He tried to kill me.

01:06:53.091 --> 01:06:54.129
Charlie.

01:06:56.009 --> 01:06:58.050
He went crazy. He took
the satellite phone.

01:06:58.211 --> 01:06:59.930
And pushed me in the cavern.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:03.089
He tried to kill me.

01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:11.169
Charlie.

01:07:18.449 --> 01:07:20.210
The boats went down.

01:07:24.609 --> 01:07:27.409
- Let's go.
- Where do we go?

01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:30.329
We have to find the phone.

01:07:42.211 --> 01:07:46.009
I've been traveling a path that
is not registered on any map.

01:07:47.770 --> 01:07:50.329
I think this valley
is full of Dinosaurs.

01:07:51.051 --> 01:07:54.610
Creatures which we thought extinct
65 million years ago.

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:58.488
Although there has been no sightings,
but anything can happen.

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:01.528
Right now I want the world to know,

01:08:01.529 --> 01:08:05.289
that the first sighting of these
animals is dedicated to you, Luke.

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:07.608
Rest in peace.

01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:10.289
Ii is a promise buddy.

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:12.527
Okay.

01:08:13.128 --> 01:08:14.087
I will continue...

01:08:27.247 --> 01:08:28.687
Stay there.

01:08:29.207 --> 01:08:30.849
- Got it?
- Yes.

01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:33.089
- Need Help?
- No, I'm fine.

01:08:34.689 --> 01:08:36.490
Definitely came through here.

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:41.087
Damn.

01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:51.808
Go!

01:08:57.689 --> 01:08:59.006
It is incredible.

01:09:12.488 --> 01:09:13.846
I lost. it

01:09:14.769 --> 01:09:17.169
- I can't see its trail.
- Maybe we'll find it.

01:09:17.969 --> 01:09:19.448
Maybe.

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:21.529
We're going up.

01:09:25.809 --> 01:09:27.327
- What was that?
- Wait.

01:09:34.769 --> 01:09:37.247
Dad!

01:09:37.408 --> 01:09:39.046
Dad!

01:09:40.170 --> 01:09:43.287
Luke. Don't be stupid. Leave.

01:09:44.048 --> 01:09:45.846
- I found something.
- Leave.

01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:49.728
Dad, this is Charlie.

01:09:50.808 --> 01:09:52.528
You have to climb.

01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:55.408
Luke...

01:09:56.208 --> 01:09:58.847
- If I can't, get out of here.
- No, I will not leave you here.

01:09:58.967 --> 01:10:00.728
Listen... Go!

01:10:03.489 --> 01:10:05.007
Let's go.

01:10:07.168 --> 01:10:08.847
- I won't let you go.
- Luke...

01:10:09.007 --> 01:10:11.047
Stay away from him. Run!

01:10:12.647 --> 01:10:14.646
No, no.

01:10:15.249 --> 01:10:16.288
I love you.

01:10:17.289 --> 01:10:18.649
Do not forget.

01:10:19.329 --> 01:10:20.608
No!

01:10:26.167 --> 01:10:27.046
Luke.

01:10:28.528 --> 01:10:29.409
Luke.

01:10:49.206 --> 01:10:50.286
Luke.

01:10:53.088 --> 01:10:54.127
Luke.

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:57.687
Let's settle this.

01:11:00.769 --> 01:11:02.965
We can do this together, right buddy?

01:11:05.649 --> 01:11:07.207
I have the satellite telephone.

01:11:10.248 --> 01:11:11.447
Crypto.

01:11:11.649 --> 01:11:13.687
You go out and call for help, right?

01:11:24.448 --> 01:11:25.808
Crypto.

01:11:27.288 --> 01:11:28.407
Luke.

01:11:33.528 --> 01:11:34.807
I can hear you.

01:11:37.488 --> 01:11:38.925
Come on, seriously.

01:11:41.967 --> 01:11:43.326
Where do you think you're going?

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:46.567
Luke.

01:11:49.448 --> 01:11:50.767
Okay buddy.

01:11:51.088 --> 01:11:53.888
Let's go.

01:11:54.329 --> 01:11:56.527
Let's go.

01:12:17.088 --> 01:12:18.646
It's your camera.

01:12:22.648 --> 01:12:23.926
This is your home.

01:12:33.966 --> 01:12:34.926
No!

01:12:35.328 --> 01:12:37.287
No!

01:12:38.648 --> 01:12:40.046
No, please!

01:12:40.247 --> 01:12:42.926
You think you can get away from me?

01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:46.327
I am a professional, Luke.

01:12:48.408 --> 01:12:51.327
In fact, now that your Dad
is no longer...

01:12:51.488 --> 01:12:54.486
I think I'm the best
in the world in this.

01:12:54.606 --> 01:12:55.845
No!

01:12:56.965 --> 01:12:58.166
Get away from me!

01:12:58.487 --> 01:13:00.004
Get away from me!

01:13:15.246 --> 01:13:16.726
Look.

01:13:17.086 --> 01:13:19.168
I don't want to do this, really.

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.446
But if you leave me the
credit for this place,

01:13:22.447 --> 01:13:24.065
then you, you cannot
walk around anymore.

01:13:25.887 --> 01:13:26.765
I'm sorry.

01:13:28.887 --> 01:13:29.766
Seriously.

01:13:44.366 --> 01:13:45.926
That's not very friendly, right?

01:13:54.406 --> 01:13:56.046
Yes it is.

01:13:58.086 --> 01:14:00.005
It is friendly, it protected me.

01:14:02.167 --> 01:14:03.366
But you're not!

01:15:15.565 --> 01:15:17.365
I'm Luke Marchant.

01:15:18.205 --> 01:15:20.125
This will be my last journal entry.

01:15:20.926 --> 01:15:24.003
I have the recordings from the cameras,
which could be useful.

01:15:26.127 --> 01:15:28.004
The satellite phone broke again.

01:15:28.886 --> 01:15:30.884
I don't know if I can fix it.

01:15:32.726 --> 01:15:34.806
I came up with a backup plan.

01:15:35.647 --> 01:15:37.205
My message in a bottle.

01:15:44.963 --> 01:15:47.725
A while ago I was walking in the Valley.

01:15:49.286 --> 01:15:50.925
Dark soon, so I have to...

01:15:50.926 --> 01:15:52.564
find shelter. But first...

01:15:53.846 --> 01:15:55.684
I want to show you something.

01:15:57.485 --> 01:15:59.483
You may never have
seen anything like it.

01:16:02.446 --> 01:16:03.605
Ready?

01:16:28.324 --> 01:16:29.684
Well Dad...

01:16:30.645 --> 01:16:33.045
I guess you would
have loved being here.

01:16:38.646 --> 01:16:41.523
I'll try to get to the center of
the valley, while there's still light.

01:16:43.605 --> 01:16:46.124
I'm not sure what I will find,
I'll have to see.

01:16:49.885 --> 01:16:51.685
But I think I have a guide.

01:17:02.286 --> 01:17:03.524
This is it.

01:17:05.606 --> 01:17:07.083
Now I leave.

01:17:10.645 --> 01:17:11.844
Maybe I see you around.

01:17:50.084 --> 01:17:52.704
<i>A new twist has occurred in the mystery</i>

01:17:52.705 --> 01:17:55.323
<i>surrounding the British
expedition in the Congo.</i>

01:17:57.644 --> 01:17:59.844
<i>A rescue team found the belongings,</i>

01:17:59.845 --> 01:18:02.044
<i>of one of the team members.</i>

01:18:02.486 --> 01:18:05.044
<i>It was found floating in one of
the rivers of the waterfall,</i>

01:18:05.205 --> 01:18:07.843
<i>flowing through the heart of the
dense jungle of Northern Congo.</i>

01:18:07.963 --> 01:18:10.183
<i>Inside the backpack,
there were video hard drives,</i>

01:18:10.184 --> 01:18:12.403
<i>carefully wrapped in waterproof bags.</i>

01:18:13.765 --> 01:18:16.724
<i>Local police expected the videos
to clarify what happened.</i>

01:18:17.286 --> 01:18:19.602
<i>And the rescue team left immediately.</i>

01:18:20.523 --> 01:18:22.284
<i>More news to follow.</i>

01:18:30.924 --> 01:18:32.083
<i>Is it working?</i>

01:18:32.842 --> 01:18:34.042
<i>I think.</i>

01:18:37.404 --> 01:18:38.563
