00:53.550 --> 00:57.054
Ladies and gentlemen,
the future has arrived.

00:57.087 --> 00:59.795
No more ironing shirts
on your kitchen table.

00:59.823 --> 01:01.666
With the automatic ironing board,

01:01.691 --> 01:04.797
convenience comes with
the push of a button.

01:04.828 --> 01:07.399
Automation is the future, my friends.

01:07.431 --> 01:10.674
Not one, not two, but five cups of coffee

01:10.700 --> 01:13.237
in the great coffee distillation machine.

01:13.270 --> 01:15.341
Ladies and gentlemen, how
many hours have you wasted

01:15.372 --> 01:17.181
making you house a home?

01:17.207 --> 01:18.709
With the paint dispenser,

01:18.742 --> 01:22.485
you can cut your home
improvement in half the time.

01:22.512 --> 01:25.083
No need to say, "Pass the gravy."

01:25.115 --> 01:26.651
With the tabletop waiter,

01:26.683 --> 01:31.689
a flick of the wrist
brings the gravy to you.

01:31.721 --> 01:34.634
Ladies, after a hard day cleaning house,

01:34.658 --> 01:37.195
there is nothing you'll enjoy more

01:37.227 --> 01:38.706
than the vibrating chair.

01:38.728 --> 01:40.799
Why stand up to turn on the lights?

01:40.831 --> 01:45.803
With the wireless switch,
you can turn them on or off

01:45.836 --> 01:48.339
from the comfort of your very own chair.

01:48.371 --> 01:49.406
It is a computer

01:49.439 --> 01:52.613
in that it will perform
mathematical calculations.

01:52.642 --> 01:54.713
However, its architecture lends itself

01:54.744 --> 01:57.486
to even more complex computations.

01:57.514 --> 01:59.585
Oh, is this a miniature version

01:59.616 --> 02:01.118
of Babbage's analytic engine?

02:01.151 --> 02:03.495
Well, the basic idea was
borrowed from Babbage, yes.

02:03.520 --> 02:04.794
However, by using Swiss gears,

02:04.821 --> 02:07.665
I've constructed a computer
four times as powerful

02:07.691 --> 02:09.728
in 1/40 the volume.

02:09.758 --> 02:13.400
Oh, that must have been
very time-consuming.

02:13.430 --> 02:16.206
Yes, it was, but it's my
belief that in the future,

02:16.233 --> 02:17.871
the machine will be assembled by automatons

02:17.901 --> 02:21.178
who are themselves operated
by a device such as this.

02:21.204 --> 02:22.706
Oh, thank you.

02:22.739 --> 02:26.243
Mm-hmm.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.517
This is the device for you.

02:28.545 --> 02:29.649
Excuse me.

02:29.679 --> 02:31.454
What is instant mail?

02:32.816 --> 02:35.296
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:37.521 --> 02:38.864
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:38.889 --> 02:41.665
gather around while I demonstrate to you

02:41.691 --> 02:44.137
what will surely be the most amazing device

02:44.161 --> 02:46.607
that you will see all summer.

02:46.630 --> 02:48.803
Has your child been smoking?

02:48.832 --> 02:50.573
Has your wife been unfaithful?

02:50.600 --> 02:54.173
Find out with the Truthizer.

02:54.204 --> 02:57.413
Now, this gentleman has kindly
volunteered to participate

02:57.440 --> 02:59.147
in a demonstration.

02:59.176 --> 03:03.147
Sir, do you believe your wife here

03:03.180 --> 03:05.353
to be too fat?

03:07.250 --> 03:10.527
Um, no.

03:10.554 --> 03:11.931
Behold.

03:11.955 --> 03:16.267
Clearly, that answer
was less than truthful.

03:16.293 --> 03:17.499
George.

03:17.527 --> 03:20.167
Sir, what are you doing here?

03:20.197 --> 03:21.369
I know what you are going to say.

03:21.398 --> 03:23.503
Before you say it, sir, I
think that your invention

03:23.533 --> 03:25.206
simply must see the light of day.

03:25.235 --> 03:27.181
They are not inventions, George.

03:27.204 --> 03:29.878
They are simply reworkings
of existing technology.

03:29.906 --> 03:32.352
Well, be that as it may, sir,
there are many investors here,

03:32.375 --> 03:34.184
and some have shown some real interest.

03:34.211 --> 03:37.522
In fact, I think the Truthizer
might win the Eaton Prize.

03:37.547 --> 03:39.390
- The Eaton Prize?
- Yes, sir.

03:39.416 --> 03:41.555
The winner has their
product manufactured and sold

03:41.585 --> 03:42.655
at all the Eaton stores.

03:42.686 --> 03:43.687
It's very prestigious.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.256
Nevertheless, George-

03:45.288 --> 03:46.699
- Well, and, sir, also,
there is someone here

03:46.723 --> 03:48.259
that you are going to want to meet.

03:48.291 --> 03:49.395
Who?

03:49.426 --> 03:50.803
Alexander Graham Bell.

03:50.827 --> 03:53.205
Alexander Graham Bell is here?

03:53.230 --> 03:54.937
He is an inventor, sir.

03:54.965 --> 03:56.569
His name wasn't on the list.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.772
He was a last-minute addition.

03:57.801 --> 03:59.906
Shall I show you where his booth is?

03:59.936 --> 04:03.748
No, no, George, not now.

04:03.773 --> 04:05.719
I'm here to meet Karl Schreyer.

04:05.742 --> 04:07.881
He left a message at
the station to meet here.

04:07.911 --> 04:08.912
Oh, yes, Karl Schreyer.

04:08.945 --> 04:11.721
He invented the suction cleaner.

04:11.748 --> 04:14.991
The days of beating carpets are over.

04:15.018 --> 04:16.361
With the suction cleaner,

04:16.386 --> 04:20.357
dust and dirt and sucked
into a special canister.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.494
Thank you.

04:21.524 --> 04:22.798
Excuse me.

04:22.826 --> 04:23.804
Mr. Schreyer.

04:23.827 --> 04:26.865
Detective Murdoch, at last we meet.

04:26.896 --> 04:28.933
How is it you know me?

04:28.965 --> 04:31.002
An inventor always notices
the work of another.

04:31.034 --> 04:33.776
Clearly a mind such as
yours is up to the challenge

04:33.803 --> 04:38.309
of determining who sent this.

04:38.341 --> 04:39.684
I found it on my table this morning.

04:39.709 --> 04:41.814
I believe it to be the work of
one of my jealous competitors.

04:41.845 --> 04:45.725
My invention is clearly
going to win the Eaton Prize.

04:45.749 --> 04:47.251
I see.

04:47.284 --> 04:48.627
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:48.652 --> 04:52.429
may I present Timothy Eaton?

04:56.293 --> 04:59.001
Thank you. Thank you.

04:59.029 --> 05:02.476
It is my pleasure each
year to announce the winner

05:02.499 --> 05:04.672
of the Eaton Prize for the most

05:04.701 --> 05:06.874
commercially promising invention.

05:06.903 --> 05:09.907
This year, the award goes to

05:09.939 --> 05:11.316
the suction cleaner.

05:11.341 --> 05:13.321
That's me.

05:13.343 --> 05:15.414
Mr. Schreyer, under the circumstances,

05:15.445 --> 05:17.618
I would advise you not
to go up on that stage.

05:17.647 --> 05:20.560
No, I have worked for
years for this moment.

05:20.583 --> 05:22.028
I'm not going to be intimidated.

05:24.521 --> 05:26.091
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

05:32.329 --> 05:33.433
Did you hear that?

05:33.463 --> 05:35.704
That was a dog whistle.

05:35.732 --> 05:38.941
Human ears are not capable
of detecting such a pitch,

05:38.968 --> 05:40.970
but that doesn't mean
the sound isn't there.

05:41.004 --> 05:42.074
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:42.105 --> 05:44.881
I have long felt like
the sound of that whistle,

05:44.908 --> 05:48.355
reverberating alone in
the silence of ignorance.

05:48.378 --> 05:52.121
Now, at long last, my
genius has been heard.

05:58.021 --> 06:00.399
Seal the exits, George.

06:00.423 --> 06:01.697
This man has been murdered.

06:03.927 --> 06:05.429
There was no gunshot?

06:05.462 --> 06:06.702
None that was heard, sir.

06:06.730 --> 06:09.074
Obviously, something penetrated his skull.

06:09.099 --> 06:10.100
As to how...

06:10.133 --> 06:12.409
Must have been someone who
used one of those mufflers

06:12.435 --> 06:13.971
that silences the gunshot.

06:14.003 --> 06:17.382
How could someone use such
a weapon without being seen?

06:17.407 --> 06:18.886
Could the shooter have escaped?

06:18.908 --> 06:20.546
The exits were sealed immediately.

06:20.577 --> 06:22.386
The killer is still in the building.

06:22.412 --> 06:24.358
We need to interview
everyone, where they were,

06:24.381 --> 06:25.451
who they were standing with.

06:25.482 --> 06:27.587
Yes, George is doing that now.

06:27.617 --> 06:29.858
Sir, is your tooth sore again?

06:29.886 --> 06:31.365
A little bit.

06:31.388 --> 06:33.493
Perhaps you should see a dentist.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.434
One of those medieval torturers?

06:35.458 --> 06:37.131
I'd rather face the Inquisition.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.161
Carry on, Murdoch.

06:43.633 --> 06:45.874
Do you have anything for me yet, Doctor?

06:45.902 --> 06:48.382
Well, this is strictly
preliminary, of course,

06:48.405 --> 06:50.385
but I would hazard a
guess that the victim died

06:50.407 --> 06:51.681
of a gunshot to the head.

06:53.443 --> 06:55.650
Anything beyond the obvious?

06:55.678 --> 06:57.419
The bullet didn't exit,

06:57.447 --> 06:59.757
suggesting low muzzle velocity.

06:59.783 --> 07:01.785
His eyes appear jaundiced.

07:01.818 --> 07:03.525
I'm not sure why.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.999
I suppose it's premature to speculate

07:06.022 --> 07:07.433
on the angle of entry.

07:07.457 --> 07:09.698
The wound seems perfectly circular,

07:09.726 --> 07:11.637
suggesting perpendicular entry.

07:11.661 --> 07:14.608
Which means the shot
would have come from above.

07:17.734 --> 07:18.974
I think you would have noticed

07:19.002 --> 07:20.948
someone hanging from the rafters.

07:20.970 --> 07:22.950
True.

07:22.972 --> 07:24.645
With your permission, Detective,

07:24.674 --> 07:26.483
I'd like to remove the body from the scene.

07:26.509 --> 07:28.750
Yes, of course.

07:30.146 --> 07:31.921
Thank you, Doctor.

07:36.453 --> 07:38.455
Terrible thing that's happened.

07:40.156 --> 07:41.464
Alexander Graham Bell.

07:41.491 --> 07:42.936
Mm, yes.

07:44.727 --> 07:46.866
Detective Murdoch, I presume.

07:46.896 --> 07:47.966
Yes.

07:47.997 --> 07:51.444
Yes, I recognize you from
your photograph at your booth.

07:51.468 --> 07:53.641
Please.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.445
Actually, it's not my booth.

07:55.472 --> 07:56.952
My constable took some liberties with-

07:56.973 --> 07:59.715
- I was particularly
impressed with your apparatus

07:59.742 --> 08:01.187
for using sound reflection

08:01.211 --> 08:04.021
to visualize subsurface
marine environments.

08:04.047 --> 08:05.185
It's fascinating.

08:05.215 --> 08:06.193
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

08:06.216 --> 08:08.719
I'd like to talk with you
more about it at some point.

08:08.751 --> 08:11.755
Oh, after you've completed
your investigation, of course.

08:11.788 --> 08:12.789
Of course.

08:12.822 --> 08:14.893
Well, yes, certainly.

08:14.924 --> 08:18.064
And the whistle that you have in your hand,

08:18.094 --> 08:19.732
confiscate it if you must,

08:19.762 --> 08:22.038
but I would like it back
when you are finished with it.

08:22.065 --> 08:25.103
What's so special about a dog whistle?

08:25.134 --> 08:27.136
Oh, it has a pitching
screw that enables one

08:27.170 --> 08:30.708
to adjust the frequency, very
useful for some experiments

08:30.740 --> 08:32.219
I was hoping to conduct with Karl.

08:33.510 --> 08:34.488
I see.

08:34.510 --> 08:36.582
Were you and Mr. Schreyer friends?

08:36.613 --> 08:38.217
Oh, not friends, no.

08:38.248 --> 08:40.125
I don't think Karl was capable

08:40.149 --> 08:41.890
of genuine friendship with anyone.

08:41.918 --> 08:45.024
But we certainly weren't adversaries,

08:45.054 --> 08:50.231
which makes me something
of a rarity in this crowd.

08:50.260 --> 08:53.896
Well, who were his adversaries, then?

08:55.064 --> 08:56.566
I hated him.

08:56.599 --> 08:58.510
I admit it freely.

08:58.535 --> 09:00.515
Why is that, Mr. Nellie?

09:00.537 --> 09:02.881
He ridiculed my tabletop waiter.

09:02.906 --> 09:04.977
He told me that it was an invention

09:05.008 --> 09:07.284
worthy of a
five-year-old.

09:07.310 --> 09:10.883
But I wasn't the only one who hated him.

09:10.914 --> 09:14.623
I saw him have a fistfight with Harding.

09:14.651 --> 09:16.688
It wasn't exactly a fistfight.

09:16.719 --> 09:18.960
Then how would you
describe it, Mr. Harding?

09:18.988 --> 09:21.867
Mm, a lot of arms flailing about.

09:21.891 --> 09:24.633
Neither of us were exactly pugilists.

09:24.661 --> 09:26.538
It was all rather pathetic, actually.

09:26.563 --> 09:28.543
So why the dustup?

09:28.565 --> 09:30.875
Schreyer changed the
setting of one of my gears.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.277
It threw off all my calculations.

09:32.302 --> 09:36.011
It took me six hours to find
which gear had been compromised.

09:36.039 --> 09:37.916
Why would he do something like that?

09:37.941 --> 09:39.545
Well, he was very competitive.

09:39.576 --> 09:42.557
He once sabotaged Barton's
automatic ironing board

09:42.579 --> 09:43.649
so that it wouldn't open,

09:43.680 --> 09:45.956
and Jeremy was showing it
to investors at the time.

09:45.982 --> 09:48.588
Disconnected the internal switch.

09:48.618 --> 09:51.326
He all but admitted it.

09:51.354 --> 09:54.767
I would never raise a hand
to hurt anyone, even Schreyer,

09:54.791 --> 09:56.600
but if wishes could kill,

09:56.626 --> 09:58.572
he would have been dead a long time ago.

09:58.595 --> 10:00.199
You hated him that much?

10:00.229 --> 10:01.674
Oh, we all did.

10:01.698 --> 10:03.336
Sabotage was the least of it.

10:03.366 --> 10:05.209
He was also a spy.

10:05.234 --> 10:07.180
His prize-winning invention?

10:07.203 --> 10:10.116
He stole the concept from O'Brien.

10:10.139 --> 10:12.050
At last year's convention in New York,

10:12.075 --> 10:15.648
I suggested that a fan
placed behind a strip of gauze

10:15.678 --> 10:19.820
could create a vacuum strong enough

10:19.849 --> 10:22.295
to lift the dirt out of a rug.

10:22.318 --> 10:26.093
It's a million-dollar idea.

10:26.122 --> 10:28.659
Did you tell Karl Schreyer about it?

10:28.691 --> 10:31.297
No, but I did send mail about it

10:31.327 --> 10:34.740
to some of the other inventors,
who sent back improvements.

10:34.764 --> 10:35.765
Imail?

10:35.798 --> 10:37.744
Instant mail. It's
Myrtle Raylin's invention.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.610
We use it to communicate back and forth

10:39.636 --> 10:40.944
between conventions.

10:40.970 --> 10:42.745
And it's your belief that Karl Schreyer

10:42.772 --> 10:45.013
got a hold of these communications?

10:45.041 --> 10:48.181
It got so bad, we had to start
imailing each other in code.

10:50.413 --> 10:52.859
The typeface of this imail

10:52.882 --> 10:54.793
matches that of the death threat.

10:54.817 --> 10:56.854
So you think the death threat was printed

10:56.886 --> 10:58.046
on one of the imail machines.

10:58.054 --> 10:59.931
- I do.
- Hmm.

10:59.956 --> 11:01.299
Thank you for agreeing to do this.

11:01.324 --> 11:02.359
Oh...

11:02.392 --> 11:03.735
I hope you don't think me presumptuous,

11:03.760 --> 11:06.673
but as both the son and
husband of deaf women,

11:06.696 --> 11:08.903
you're the only person I
know who reads sign language.

11:08.931 --> 11:10.672
Hmm.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.145
I do it with reluctance, I'm afraid.

11:12.168 --> 11:13.203
Oh'?

11:13.236 --> 11:14.806
Yes, you see, it's my
belief that deaf people

11:14.837 --> 11:18.011
should learn to articulate audible speech.

11:18.041 --> 11:19.850
I've tried to get Myrtle to learn,

11:19.876 --> 11:21.719
but she's very stubborn.

11:21.744 --> 11:22.950
Does she read lips?

11:22.979 --> 11:26.051
Oh, yes, more than she lets on.

11:26.082 --> 11:29.222
Instant mail is a process
of sending letters instantly

11:29.252 --> 11:31.129
anywhere in the world.

11:32.422 --> 11:34.265
How does it work?

11:34.290 --> 11:35.325
A letter is typed.

11:35.358 --> 11:38.202
The information is recorded
onto a wire cylinder.

11:38.227 --> 11:40.173
At the push of the "send" key,

11:40.196 --> 11:42.176
a message is sent over the telephone lines

11:42.198 --> 11:45.475
to the intended recipient.

11:53.776 --> 11:54.914
Oh.

11:54.944 --> 11:57.754
Um...

11:57.780 --> 12:02.752
I believe that this message was printed

12:02.785 --> 12:05.493
using one of your machines.

12:08.725 --> 12:10.966
Who has these machines?

12:10.993 --> 12:13.701
She sent units to each of the inventors

12:13.730 --> 12:15.004
she was closest to.

12:15.031 --> 12:17.307
I don't think Karl ever received one.

12:19.135 --> 12:20.341
Why was that?

12:20.369 --> 12:22.007
She disliked him.

12:22.038 --> 12:24.985
Oh, she detested him.

12:26.209 --> 12:27.313
Why?

12:27.343 --> 12:30.290
He once declared his amorous intentions

12:30.313 --> 12:31.485
rather inappropriately.

12:31.514 --> 12:34.757
When she rejected his advances,
he became vile and abusive.

12:34.784 --> 12:37.321
He insulted her femininity
and mocked her deafness

12:37.353 --> 12:39.230
and said that instant mail
wasn't really an invention

12:39.255 --> 12:41.792
at all but merely a reworking
of Edison's stock ticker.

12:41.824 --> 12:43.201
Stock ticker.

12:43.226 --> 12:44.728
That was good, Myrtle.

12:44.761 --> 12:45.899
You should speak more.

12:45.928 --> 12:48.431
So that message could have been printed

12:48.464 --> 12:52.173
on any one of the machines you distributed?

12:52.201 --> 12:53.839
Yes.

12:53.870 --> 12:55.975
Mm-hmm.

12:56.005 --> 12:59.214
Would there be a record
of the last message sent

12:59.242 --> 13:01.813
on the machine that sent that message?

13:01.844 --> 13:03.152
Oh, yes.

13:03.179 --> 13:06.353
Each machine can retain up
to 20 messages, depending,

13:06.382 --> 13:08.919
of course, on the length.

13:08.951 --> 13:10.089
Oh, that's good.

13:10.119 --> 13:11.154
Mm-hmm.

13:11.187 --> 13:12.791
That's very good.

13:15.958 --> 13:18.097
The bullet struck the left, upper portion

13:18.127 --> 13:19.970
of the frontal bone

13:19.996 --> 13:22.499
roughly perpendicular to
the curvature of the skull.

13:22.532 --> 13:25.445
It then traveled in a downward trajectory

13:25.468 --> 13:28.176
and lodged inside the right temporal lobe.

13:30.273 --> 13:33.777
So the bullet did come from above.

13:33.810 --> 13:35.153
That would seem to be the case.

13:35.178 --> 13:39.820
I also managed to extract the bullet.

13:46.222 --> 13:47.360
You recognize this?

13:47.390 --> 13:48.801
It's a ball bearing.

13:48.825 --> 13:51.829
Yes, the same kind you use
in your Tabletop Waiter.

13:51.861 --> 13:55.570
Indeed, it is,
nickel-plated, high-quality,

13:55.598 --> 13:59.136
imported especially from Bern, Switzerland.

13:59.168 --> 14:03.378
You may have noticed the
rotational smoothness.

14:03.406 --> 14:04.510
Why do you ask?

14:04.540 --> 14:07.487
It was the projectile
used to kill Karl Schreyer.

14:09.045 --> 14:10.991
How do you explain that, Mr. Nellie?

14:11.013 --> 14:14.483
Well, obviously, someone is
trying to cast suspicion on me.

14:14.517 --> 14:17.589
I mean, why would
someone use a ball bearing

14:17.620 --> 14:20.897
when a regular bullet would do?

14:20.923 --> 14:24.302
Mr. Nellie, where were you
when the shot was fired?

14:24.327 --> 14:26.830
I was watching the speech.

14:26.863 --> 14:28.137
Who were you standing with?

14:28.164 --> 14:30.474
Your constable already asked me this.

14:30.499 --> 14:33.207
I don't remember.

14:33.236 --> 14:35.443
You think he might have been set up?

14:35.471 --> 14:36.848
It's possible.

14:36.873 --> 14:37.851
His point is well-taken.

14:37.874 --> 14:41.549
Why use a ball bearing if not
to implicate him in the murder?

14:41.577 --> 14:44.057
Well, I read the statements.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.287
All the inventors seem to
hate this Schreyer fellow.

14:46.315 --> 14:48.226
Question is, which one
do you think did this?

14:48.251 --> 14:51.425
The death threat was sent
using one of Miss Raylin's

14:51.454 --> 14:53.866
instant mailing machines.

14:53.890 --> 14:56.393
George and Henry are
reading the imails now.

14:56.425 --> 14:58.496
- Imails?
- Instant mailings.

14:58.527 --> 15:01.872
Sir, is that cocaine?

15:01.898 --> 15:03.878
Mm, this bloody tooth.

15:03.900 --> 15:05.038
Helps to numb the pain.

15:05.067 --> 15:07.411
Are you sure that's wise?

15:07.436 --> 15:08.881
Don't you start on me, Murdoch.

15:08.905 --> 15:09.975
Sir, I have nothing against

15:10.006 --> 15:12.919
the use of cocaine as a topical analgesic,

15:12.942 --> 15:14.046
but given your history with the drug...

15:14.076 --> 15:15.180
There you are, Thomas.

15:15.211 --> 15:16.588
Oh, bloody hell.

15:19.015 --> 15:20.255
I'll speak to you later, sir.

15:21.550 --> 15:23.188
Where were you at 2:00 this afternoon?

15:23.219 --> 15:24.357
Hello, dear.

15:24.387 --> 15:25.957
You were supposed to be at the dentist.

15:25.988 --> 15:27.899
I had duties to attend to, Margaret.

15:27.924 --> 15:30.234
Thomas, don't be a baby about this.

15:30.259 --> 15:32.398
We're trying to solve a murder here.

15:32.428 --> 15:35.034
I can't be spending half my day
gallivanting off to the dentist.

15:35.064 --> 15:38.136
Well, I've made another
appointment after work,

15:38.167 --> 15:40.078
and I'll be back here to escort you to it.

15:40.102 --> 15:42.412
I can hold your hand if need be.

15:42.438 --> 15:43.974
I'm not a child, Margaret.

15:44.006 --> 15:46.213
After work.

15:47.276 --> 15:48.516
Higgins.

15:50.313 --> 15:52.691
Sir, we've printed off the imails.

15:52.715 --> 15:54.490
They're gibberish mostly.

15:54.517 --> 15:56.155
Yes, apparently, they were encrypted

15:56.185 --> 15:59.223
to keep Karl Schreyer from reading them.

15:59.255 --> 16:02.566
The only exception was the death threat.

16:02.591 --> 16:05.401
Which machine was this one printed on?

16:05.428 --> 16:07.271
Mr. Bell's, sir.

16:07.296 --> 16:09.298
Alexander Graham Bell.

16:09.332 --> 16:10.504
I'm sorry, sir.

16:10.533 --> 16:12.069
I know he's something of an idol.

16:14.170 --> 16:16.275
Bring him in, George.

16:23.980 --> 16:27.587
That message was written on
your instant mail machine.

16:27.616 --> 16:29.357
That may very well be,

16:29.385 --> 16:31.422
but if you're looking for
the author of that note,

16:31.454 --> 16:33.434
I'm afraid it isn't me.

16:33.456 --> 16:35.561
Then how did it come to
be written on your machine?

16:35.591 --> 16:37.332
Well, someone must have gone into my booth

16:37.360 --> 16:38.395
when I wasn't there.

16:38.427 --> 16:41.465
It would have been easy.

16:41.497 --> 16:43.340
Where were you at the time of the shooting?

16:43.366 --> 16:45.437
I was recording the speech.

16:45.468 --> 16:47.072
Recording?

16:47.103 --> 16:48.377
- Mm.
- Why?

16:48.404 --> 16:50.213
Well, Karl had asked me to...

16:50.239 --> 16:52.014
provided he'd won, of course.

16:53.309 --> 16:56.256
You mean you have a recording of the speech

16:56.278 --> 16:58.315
and the moment he was shot?

16:58.347 --> 17:02.124
Mm.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.324
Would you like to hear it?

17:04.353 --> 17:06.162
Karl wanted a permanent
record of the moment

17:06.188 --> 17:08.167
when he bested the competition.

17:08.190 --> 17:09.692
He was vainglorious.

17:09.724 --> 17:11.762
As much as he was detested by others,

17:11.794 --> 17:14.569
he had a very high opinion of himself.

17:14.597 --> 17:17.476
If he was so disagreeable, why
agree to make the recording?

17:17.500 --> 17:19.377
Well, he agreed to blow the dog whistle,

17:19.402 --> 17:21.211
and I wanted to test the frequency limits

17:21.237 --> 17:22.511
of my recorder.

17:22.538 --> 17:25.484
Why not simply conduct
a controlled experiment?

17:25.508 --> 17:28.454
Well, he refused to relinquish possession.

17:28.477 --> 17:30.218
But I thought it was your whistle.

17:30.246 --> 17:32.624
Yes, I had one just like it, and I lost it

17:32.648 --> 17:35.219
about the same time he
came into possession of his.

17:35.251 --> 17:37.356
You think he stole it.

17:37.386 --> 17:40.629
You're the detective, Detective.

17:40.656 --> 17:44.661
I find it hard to believe that
someone could be that petty.

17:44.693 --> 17:46.764
Oh, I think I understand.

17:46.796 --> 17:49.037
You know how some men are
born with natural charm?

17:49.065 --> 17:50.635
You just can't help but like them.

17:50.666 --> 17:51.770
Of course.

17:51.801 --> 17:55.146
Well, Karl had negative charm.

17:55.171 --> 17:57.344
No matter what he did,
people didn't like him.

17:57.373 --> 17:59.614
Rejection can make a man bitter,

17:59.642 --> 18:02.555
which in turn makes him even more disliked.

18:02.578 --> 18:03.716
A vicious circle.

18:03.746 --> 18:06.090
Mm, yes.

18:06.115 --> 18:08.322
Let's have a listen.

18:08.350 --> 18:09.522
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:09.552 --> 18:12.294
I have long felt like
the sound of that whistle,

18:12.321 --> 18:15.427
reverberating alone in
the silence of ignorance.

18:15.458 --> 18:19.804
Now, at long last, my
genius has been heard.

18:23.399 --> 18:25.470
I can't make out anything definitive.

18:25.501 --> 18:27.742
I only hear the sound of the crowd.

18:27.770 --> 18:30.546
You know, Detective, to paraphrase Karl,

18:30.573 --> 18:32.519
just because we can't hear a sound

18:32.541 --> 18:34.851
doesn't mean it's not there.

18:34.877 --> 18:37.687
Allow me to introduce you
to my latest invention.

18:40.316 --> 18:42.796
I call it an audiograph.

18:42.818 --> 18:44.491
I developed it to help deaf people

18:44.520 --> 18:46.466
visualize the sounds that they were making.

18:46.489 --> 18:48.594
You see, it converts sound into a signal

18:48.624 --> 18:51.400
and then traces the wave on paper

18:51.427 --> 18:53.270
much like your graphizer.

18:53.295 --> 18:54.672
Well, yes, but the difference is,

18:54.697 --> 18:57.701
you've isolated certain frequencies.

18:57.733 --> 19:00.339
Oh, well, yes.

19:02.371 --> 19:03.441
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:03.472 --> 19:06.112
I have long felt like
the sound of that whistle,

19:06.142 --> 19:09.146
reverberating alone in
the silence of ignorance.

19:09.178 --> 19:13.558
Now, at long last, my
genius has been heard.

19:17.186 --> 19:21.532
So his speech lasted 18 seconds.

19:21.557 --> 19:24.470
And here is where the noise
of the crowd rises sharply

19:24.493 --> 19:27.702
in reaction to his death
about two seconds later.

19:27.730 --> 19:31.177
So the bullet would have been
fired between here and here.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.237
Mmhmm. Well, this is interesting.

19:33.269 --> 19:36.148
Look how the amplitude of
the highest frequency spikes

19:36.172 --> 19:37.515
at the precise moment that he was shot.

19:37.540 --> 19:41.647
Yes, it raises sharply and then falls off.

19:41.677 --> 19:44.214
Like a bell ringing,

19:44.246 --> 19:48.786
as if the bullet hit something metallic.

19:48.817 --> 19:52.924
Well, if it did and
that's what I think it is,

19:52.955 --> 19:56.334
it would explain why we
saw nothing in the rafters.

19:56.358 --> 19:58.497
The bullet was deflected.

19:58.527 --> 20:01.269
A bit higher, Constable.

20:01.297 --> 20:03.436
Higher.

20:03.465 --> 20:05.672
There.

20:05.701 --> 20:08.443
So the metal surface that
we directed the projectile

20:08.470 --> 20:10.245
was that steel beam.

20:10.272 --> 20:11.546
It has to be.

20:11.574 --> 20:13.918
Now all we have to do is
match the angle of incidence

20:13.943 --> 20:16.617
to the angle of reflection.

20:16.645 --> 20:18.818
Sir, have you noticed anything different

20:18.847 --> 20:20.520
about the inspector of late?

20:20.549 --> 20:21.584
He has a toothache?

20:21.617 --> 20:22.891
Well, yes, I know about the tooth,

20:22.918 --> 20:25.831
but it's more his
behavior I'm worried about.

20:25.854 --> 20:28.562
One minute, he's edgy, cantankerous,

20:28.591 --> 20:29.729
and then the next minute,

20:29.758 --> 20:31.465
he's full of backslapping bon ami.

20:31.493 --> 20:33.734
It's almost like-do you
remember a couple of years back

20:33.762 --> 20:35.969
he was taking that gold cure?

20:35.998 --> 20:37.944
Yes, it turned out to be cocaine.

20:37.967 --> 20:40.504
Well, now he's rubbing cocaine on his gums

20:40.536 --> 20:42.413
as an analgesic for his tooth.

20:42.438 --> 20:44.975
I'm afraid that he's gonna have...

20:45.007 --> 20:46.213
what do they call it?

20:46.242 --> 20:47.220
A relapse.

20:47.243 --> 20:49.917
I share your concern, George,
but he's seeing a dentist today.

20:49.945 --> 20:52.221
Hopefully the situation will be rectified.

20:52.248 --> 20:53.454
Hmm.

20:55.451 --> 20:56.486
Oh, that's odd.

21:00.356 --> 21:02.236
The shooter would have
had to have been standing

21:02.258 --> 21:03.760
much further back.

21:03.792 --> 21:05.533
But, sir, if he was standing farther back,

21:05.561 --> 21:07.336
this sign would have been in his way.

21:07.363 --> 21:08.637
Indeed.

21:08.664 --> 21:10.473
Unless, of course, the shooter was standing

21:10.499 --> 21:12.536
in front of the sign... if he was tall...

21:12.568 --> 21:15.014
extremely tall.

21:15.037 --> 21:17.244
I suppose we would have
noticed a giant with a weapon

21:17.273 --> 21:18.274
in the back of the room.

21:19.675 --> 21:22.315
There's another possibility, George.

21:22.344 --> 21:23.846
I'm going to need a wrench.

21:28.684 --> 21:29.844
Do what you have to do, Doc.

21:29.852 --> 21:31.263
Let's get this over with.

21:31.287 --> 21:32.425
Oh, good for you, Thomas.

21:33.756 --> 21:34.996
My apologies for interrupting.

21:35.024 --> 21:37.300
It's Detective Murdoch,
sir. He needs you right away.

21:37.326 --> 21:38.828
Bloody hell.

21:38.861 --> 21:39.896
Can't this wait?

21:39.928 --> 21:41.999
He was quite insistent, sir.

21:42.031 --> 21:44.341
Oh, sorry, Doc.

21:44.366 --> 21:46.004
We'll have to do this another time.

21:46.035 --> 21:48.345
Margaret, schedule another appointment.

21:48.370 --> 21:50.543
What's the panic this time, Higgins?

21:55.811 --> 21:58.052
So how was that, sir?

21:58.080 --> 22:00.321
Perfect, bloody perfect.

22:00.349 --> 22:01.692
Cracking fine job, Higgins.

22:01.717 --> 22:03.628
- Thank you, sir.
- Can I treat you to a pint?

22:03.652 --> 22:04.722
Yes, sir.

22:08.791 --> 22:10.327
George Crabtree?

22:10.359 --> 22:12.635
Yes. What can I do for you?

22:12.661 --> 22:14.663
I want that Truthizer you've invented.

22:14.697 --> 22:17.735
Well, now, I didn't exactly invent it.

22:17.766 --> 22:19.712
So you don't hold the patent?

22:19.735 --> 22:22.409
It's pending.

22:22.438 --> 22:25.078
Well, what would it take
to buy it from you, then?

22:25.107 --> 22:26.984
I suppose I would have
to speak with my partner.

22:27.009 --> 22:28.613
Well, why don't you let me talk to him?

22:28.644 --> 22:30.920
No, no, no, no, it's
best if you speak with me.

22:30.946 --> 22:32.391
I'm the people person.

22:32.414 --> 22:34.826
He's-he's a temperamental sort.

22:34.850 --> 22:36.420
My offer to come to terms with you

22:36.452 --> 22:38.659
is only available for 24 hours.

22:38.687 --> 22:39.927
Only 24 hours?

22:39.955 --> 22:41.457
I don't sit around waiting

22:41.490 --> 22:43.333
for money to come to me, Mr. Crabtree.

22:43.359 --> 22:45.532
I go after it.

22:52.368 --> 22:54.075
Uh, sir, good news.

22:54.103 --> 22:57.812
We have an investor
interested in the Truthizer.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.945
George, all the Truthizer does

22:59.975 --> 23:01.750
is measure an increase in heart rate.

23:01.777 --> 23:03.916
It's only value is in telling the liar

23:03.946 --> 23:05.721
that we know they're lying.

23:05.748 --> 23:07.523
Which is exactly what makes
it such an essential tool

23:07.549 --> 23:08.527
for law enforcement.

23:08.550 --> 23:09.722
George-

23:09.752 --> 23:11.356
- Sir, why should we be the only station

23:11.387 --> 23:12.627
to have such an instrument?

23:12.654 --> 23:14.065
I believe it is our responsibility

23:14.089 --> 23:15.591
to put it out into the world.

23:15.624 --> 23:17.661
Criminals everywhere will
be quaking in their boots

23:17.693 --> 23:21.402
if they know we could look
into their guilty minds,

23:21.430 --> 23:23.376
not to mention what a profit we could make

23:23.399 --> 23:24.878
from such a venture.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.743
Fine, George.

23:26.769 --> 23:30.649
I authorize you to speak to
an investor on our behalf.

23:30.672 --> 23:32.447
Oh, excellent, sir.

23:32.474 --> 23:33.578
I am very excited.

23:33.609 --> 23:34.986
Mm.

23:40.482 --> 23:42.484
What is it?

23:42.518 --> 23:45.021
I have no idea.

23:45.053 --> 23:46.999
This is a battery.

23:47.022 --> 23:51.630
There are wires leading
to a switch of some sort,

23:51.660 --> 23:55.005
but then this appears
to be a switch as well.

24:00.536 --> 24:04.541
I'm going to bypass these switches

24:04.573 --> 24:08.111
to see if I can figure out-

24:17.085 --> 24:19.622
I believe we've found
our murder weapon, George.

24:22.524 --> 24:23.730
So this thing fired a ball,

24:23.759 --> 24:25.534
which was then redirected
by a chunk of metal

24:25.561 --> 24:26.972
towards Schreyer's head.

24:26.995 --> 24:28.440
Hence the need for a projectile

24:28.464 --> 24:30.501
with complete angular uniformity.

24:30.532 --> 24:31.670
A ball bearing.

24:31.700 --> 24:32.735
Yes.

24:32.768 --> 24:34.441
Well, just say that then.

24:34.470 --> 24:38.543
Why do you always dress up
simple concepts in $5 words?

24:38.574 --> 24:40.611
Did the doctor yank your tooth?

24:40.642 --> 24:41.677
No, he couldn't.

24:41.710 --> 24:43.690
An emergency intervened.

24:43.712 --> 24:44.690
No worries.

24:44.713 --> 24:46.488
It will clear itself up eventually.

24:46.515 --> 24:50.930
So this ball bearing fellow
Nellie, is he our man then?

24:50.953 --> 24:51.954
It's possible.

24:51.987 --> 24:54.024
Sir, have a look at this.

24:54.056 --> 24:59.062
Note the similarities between
the device and this invention.

25:01.864 --> 25:03.241
Who built that then?

25:03.265 --> 25:04.676
Jeremy Barton.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.008
Well, bring him.

25:06.034 --> 25:07.206
Well, not so fast, sir.

25:07.236 --> 25:10.240
This is O'Brian's wireless switch.

25:10.272 --> 25:13.014
A similar switch is used inside the device

25:13.041 --> 25:15.078
to trigger it remotely, I suspect.

25:15.110 --> 25:17.215
Bloody hell. So O'Brien built it.

25:17.246 --> 25:18.486
Ah.

25:18.514 --> 25:20.551
Sir, you see these gears?

25:20.582 --> 25:22.994
They are the same as the gears used

25:23.018 --> 25:26.056
in Harding's miniature analytic engine.

25:26.088 --> 25:27.066
Let me guess.

25:27.089 --> 25:28.864
He didn't build it either.

25:28.891 --> 25:33.067
Sir, I suspect that this
is a collaborative effort

25:33.095 --> 25:35.701
using the expertise of
five different inventors.

25:35.731 --> 25:38.541
You've only mentioned four so far.

25:38.567 --> 25:41.912
Oh, I suspect Myrtle
Raylin is also involved.

25:41.937 --> 25:43.507
The deaf woman who invented the-

25:43.539 --> 25:44.643
what do you call it?

25:44.673 --> 25:45.651
Imails.

25:45.674 --> 25:46.652
Yes, sir.

25:46.675 --> 25:49.053
A project like this would
require extensive coordination

25:49.077 --> 25:51.887
and communication over great distances.

25:51.914 --> 25:53.894
Coded imails would fit the bill.

25:53.916 --> 25:56.294
Myrtle Raylin wrote all of the codes.

25:56.318 --> 25:58.798
There's only one thing that troubles me.

25:58.820 --> 26:00.595
What's that?

26:00.622 --> 26:02.260
O'Brian's wireless switch.

26:02.291 --> 26:05.033
It doesn't actually activate the device.

26:06.228 --> 26:08.037
Even though his switch is inside.

26:08.063 --> 26:09.098
Well, yes, sir.

26:09.131 --> 26:11.008
There's another primary switch.

26:11.033 --> 26:12.740
A switch that turns on a switch?

26:12.768 --> 26:13.803
What the hell for?

26:13.835 --> 26:14.813
I have no idea,

26:14.836 --> 26:18.545
but I suspect there's yet
another inventor involved.

26:18.574 --> 26:22.681
Maybe it's your pal Alexander Graham Bell.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.816
I have no reason to suspect him.

26:24.846 --> 26:26.848
Not yet.

26:47.002 --> 26:49.846
Your ball bearing wasn't
used to frame you, Mr. Nellie.

26:49.871 --> 26:51.350
It wasn't?

26:51.373 --> 26:55.219
It was used as a component in
a plot to kill Karl Schreyer.

26:55.243 --> 26:56.221
Plot'?

26:56.244 --> 26:58.622
Oh, ridiculous.

26:58.647 --> 27:01.253
Then how do you explain
the use of your invention

27:01.283 --> 27:03.593
as a component in the
device that killed him?

27:03.619 --> 27:05.895
Someone else must have put it there.

27:05.921 --> 27:07.093
It wouldn't be difficult.

27:07.122 --> 27:08.760
It's just a switch.

27:08.790 --> 27:10.997
You must admit, it bears
a strong resemblance

27:11.026 --> 27:12.198
to what you invented.

27:12.227 --> 27:14.867
Well, whoever built this
obviously copied my design,

27:14.896 --> 27:18.639
but this is so much more complex.

27:18.667 --> 27:20.977
Are those Harding's gears?

27:23.071 --> 27:24.106
Mr. Harding?

27:26.208 --> 27:27.414
Yes, they are.

27:28.977 --> 27:30.217
And it seems that in this device,

27:30.245 --> 27:31.781
they act more of a delay mechanism.

27:31.813 --> 27:34.259
However, they do still
serve as the central control.

27:34.282 --> 27:35.727
It's just in a machine like this,

27:35.751 --> 27:38.254
it doesn't require a logical complexity.

27:38.286 --> 27:40.823
Of course, your invention doesn't suggest

27:40.856 --> 27:42.858
an aptitude for complexity.

27:42.891 --> 27:43.961
Now, see here.

27:43.992 --> 27:45.903
- Pardon me?
- Oh.

27:47.329 --> 27:50.139
Could you have built this device yourself?

27:51.667 --> 27:52.668
No.

27:53.935 --> 27:56.313
Perhaps if I applied myself.

27:56.338 --> 27:58.674
No.

27:58.707 --> 27:59.879
Of course I could have.

27:59.908 --> 28:02.855
Well, I didn't, but I could have.

28:02.878 --> 28:04.880
It is my belief that each one of you

28:04.913 --> 28:09.885
contributed to the design and
construction of this device.

28:09.918 --> 28:12.194
And that makes you all
equally guilty of murder

28:12.220 --> 28:14.063
in the eyes of the law.

28:14.089 --> 28:16.763
Now, the first one of you
to admit their complicity

28:16.792 --> 28:19.796
in this scheme will be spared the noose.

28:19.828 --> 28:23.742
Everyone else, however, I
guarantee you will be hanged

28:23.765 --> 28:27.178
by the neck until they are dead.

28:27.202 --> 28:29.842
So I ask you once again,

28:29.871 --> 28:33.114
were you or were you
not part of a conspiracy

28:33.141 --> 28:34.745
to kill Karl Schreyer?

28:34.776 --> 28:36.312
No.

28:36.344 --> 28:37.379
Of course not.

28:37.412 --> 28:38.390
No.

28:38.413 --> 28:39.483
No.

28:42.050 --> 28:43.893
Mr. Harding.

28:43.919 --> 28:45.694
" Huh?"

28:45.721 --> 28:47.723
Oh, no.

28:50.325 --> 28:53.135
May I stay and study this?

28:54.463 --> 28:56.943
Could any one of them have
built this by themselves?

28:56.965 --> 29:00.708
Harding, possibly, but
he admitted it so freely.

29:00.736 --> 29:02.875
Would a guilty person be so guileless?

29:02.904 --> 29:06.750
Only if his guilelessness was an act.

29:07.809 --> 29:09.254
Sir, are you all right?

29:09.277 --> 29:10.255
Oh, I'm fine.

29:10.278 --> 29:12.349
The heroin has knocked me back a bit.

29:12.380 --> 29:14.018
Heroin?

29:14.049 --> 29:16.996
The cocaine wasn't quite doing the job.

29:17.018 --> 29:20.488
This new drug works wonders, Murdoch.

29:20.522 --> 29:24.334
Oh, yes, I'm sure heroin
is very effective, sir,

29:24.359 --> 29:25.963
but it's new.

29:25.994 --> 29:29.066
It could prove to be just
as addictive as cocaine.

29:29.097 --> 29:32.806
It's only till the
toothache goes away, Murdoch.

29:32.834 --> 29:36.247
Now, if you don't mind,

29:36.271 --> 29:39.741
I think I'm gonna have a bit of a nap.

29:45.547 --> 29:45.746
Sir, we've been deciphering the imails.

29:45.747 --> 29:49.160
Sir, we've been deciphering the imails

29:49.184 --> 29:50.925
we got from Miss Raylin
with her code wheel.

29:50.952 --> 29:52.022
Oh.

29:52.053 --> 29:53.031
How does it work?

29:53.054 --> 29:55.014
The number of letters in
the sender's first name

29:55.023 --> 29:57.765
added to the number of letters
in the day the message was sent

29:57.793 --> 29:58.828
gives you the offset.

29:58.860 --> 29:59.895
Offset?

29:59.928 --> 30:02.272
Yes, say Myrtle sends
a message on Thursday.

30:02.297 --> 30:05.176
Six letters in "Myrtle,"
eight letters in "Thursday."

30:05.200 --> 30:07.544
Eight plus six gives you...

30:07.569 --> 30:09.981
- 14.
- 14.

30:10.005 --> 30:12.508
So the offset is then 14.

30:12.541 --> 30:16.887
Ah, so "A" becomes "N" and so on.

30:16.912 --> 30:19.984
That way, the code changes
every day with every sender.

30:20.015 --> 30:21.460
That's very clever.

30:21.483 --> 30:23.326
Mm, now, it didn't work for all of them.

30:23.351 --> 30:25.991
This one particular imail was different.

30:27.823 --> 30:29.962
Who sent this one?

30:29.991 --> 30:32.403
Miss Raylin, we were unable to decipher

30:32.427 --> 30:36.239
one of the imails that you
wrote to the other inventors.

30:36.264 --> 30:37.937
It was sent on Tuesday.

30:53.281 --> 30:55.852
"This does not conform to the code."

30:55.884 --> 30:57.488
That's right.

30:57.519 --> 30:59.829
Can you tell me why that is?

30:59.855 --> 31:02.165
Uh...

31:02.190 --> 31:04.329
This was only written four days ago

31:04.359 --> 31:07.533
shortly after the
invention convention began.

31:07.562 --> 31:10.270
Do you remember what you wrote?

31:16.438 --> 31:18.611
I think this is a specially coded message

31:18.640 --> 31:20.313
written to the other inventors

31:20.342 --> 31:23.289
outlining the plot to kill Karl Schreyer.

31:37.359 --> 31:38.895
This isn't one of our ciphers.

31:38.927 --> 31:40.167
How do you know?

31:40.195 --> 31:41.970
Oh, I've learned to see letters as numbers.

31:41.997 --> 31:43.032
"N. 'S u.'
-..

31:43.064 --> 31:44.304
"B" is "Z."

31:44.332 --> 31:46.403
Then in a standard
cipher, the letters shift,

31:46.434 --> 31:49.142
but the numerical relationship
between them stays the same.

31:49.170 --> 31:52.151
And you're able to
recognize these patterns?

31:52.173 --> 31:53.151
Oh, yes.

31:53.174 --> 31:54.278
Yeah, it's easy.

31:54.309 --> 31:55.379
I always look for the word "the."

31:55.410 --> 31:56.610
"T" is always 11 letters from.

31:56.611 --> 31:58.056
"H" is always four letters from.

31:58.079 --> 32:00.116
But I think you'll find
that there's no such sequence

32:00.148 --> 32:01.354
in this message.

32:01.383 --> 32:05.661
Therefore, whoever wrote it
was using a more complex cipher.

32:05.687 --> 32:08.634
You think it would be possible
to use your mechanical analyzer

32:08.657 --> 32:10.136
to break this cipher?

32:10.158 --> 32:12.604
Well,

32:12.627 --> 32:16.074
I supposed I'd have to...

32:16.097 --> 32:19.510
It's a straightforward, logical looping.

32:19.534 --> 32:24.279
And I'd have to assign
each letter to a number.

32:24.306 --> 32:25.506
Well, if it's too difficult-

32:25.507 --> 32:26.508
No, no, no, no.

32:26.541 --> 32:28.578
It's absolutely possible.

32:28.610 --> 32:30.021
When can we begin?

32:33.181 --> 32:35.457
The machine's instructions
are punched in cardboard.

32:35.483 --> 32:37.485
Like Jacquard's loom.

32:37.519 --> 32:39.055
Exactly.

32:39.087 --> 32:41.407
I'm telling the machine to
execute a repeatable calculation

32:41.423 --> 32:43.096
that will shift forward with every loop,

32:43.124 --> 32:45.161
and that should test
every possible sequence.

32:46.628 --> 32:48.164
How long will that take?

32:48.196 --> 32:52.076
Oh, no more than a couple of hours.

33:06.982 --> 33:08.063
I just don't understand it.

33:08.083 --> 33:09.960
I've tried every linear combination.

33:09.985 --> 33:12.192
I mean, I could try a more complex routine,

33:12.220 --> 33:14.200
but I just doubt that anyone
would go to the trouble

33:14.222 --> 33:19.001
of deciphering such a code, unless...

33:19.027 --> 33:21.439
Unless what?

33:21.463 --> 33:24.239
Unless it's a random code.

33:24.265 --> 33:25.369
- Random?
- Random.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.141
There is no numerical relationship.

33:27.168 --> 33:29.671
Each letter is just randomly
assigned to another letter.

33:29.704 --> 33:32.116
Can you crack such a code?

33:32.140 --> 33:36.247
Well, yes, but the
possible combinations are...

33:36.277 --> 33:40.384
I
- this is an N factorial calculation, Detective.

33:40.415 --> 33:42.554
26 times 25 times 24-

33:42.584 --> 33:44.461
- Is it possible?
- In theory.

33:44.486 --> 33:47.695
But the possible permutations
are in the trillions,

33:47.722 --> 33:49.133
in the quadrillions.

33:49.157 --> 33:50.500
So you can't do it.

33:50.525 --> 33:51.697
No.

33:55.230 --> 33:58.109
I can't do it.

34:02.270 --> 34:05.717
So could it be this... what do you call it?

34:05.740 --> 34:07.219
Random cipher.

34:07.242 --> 34:08.243
I don't know.

34:08.275 --> 34:10.415
It would require the
sender and the receiver

34:10.445 --> 34:13.324
to memorize a 26-letter code.

34:13.348 --> 34:15.157
Mm, that wouldn't be easy.

34:15.183 --> 34:17.527
No, you're right, sir, too prone to error.

34:17.552 --> 34:20.328
Must be something else,
something more simple.

34:21.688 --> 34:25.068
Well, I'm sure you'll
figure it out, Murdoch.

34:36.271 --> 34:39.741
But I always look for the word "the."

34:39.774 --> 34:43.688
A reoccurring grouping of three letters.

34:43.710 --> 34:45.485
Three letters.

35:05.667 --> 35:06.702
George.

35:06.734 --> 35:10.238
George, I've cracked the code.

35:10.271 --> 35:12.444
Have a look.

35:12.474 --> 35:13.612
Arrest them.

35:13.641 --> 35:14.813
Arrest them all.

35:19.681 --> 35:22.594
"We have precisely 20 seconds

35:22.617 --> 35:25.097
"between when the device is triggered

35:25.120 --> 35:28.567
"and when the shot is fired.

35:28.590 --> 35:31.264
"Should the machine be discovered,

35:31.292 --> 35:34.102
"it is imperative that
we stick to the plan.

35:34.129 --> 35:38.600
We must hang together, or
we all hang separately."

35:38.633 --> 35:40.670
Well, that proves it.

35:40.702 --> 35:43.114
But, sir, they're all
sticking to their story.

35:43.138 --> 35:44.879
Sir, this is the perfect opportunity

35:44.906 --> 35:47.716
to demonstrate our
Truthizer to our investor.

35:47.742 --> 35:49.744
Your investor, George.

35:49.777 --> 35:51.279
Perhaps he's got a point.

35:52.814 --> 35:56.694
If they know that we
know that they are lying.

35:56.718 --> 36:01.189
One of them just might... just might crack.

36:10.165 --> 36:11.269
Your arm, please.

36:11.299 --> 36:14.280
Now, watch it in action, Miss Dickinson.

36:14.302 --> 36:15.781
We know for certain that they're guilty.

36:15.803 --> 36:17.908
Now, as they engage in
their prevarications,

36:17.939 --> 36:20.545
their guilty mind will cause the blue fluid

36:20.575 --> 36:22.282
to rise in the tube.

36:22.310 --> 36:23.687
L, of course,

36:23.711 --> 36:25.452
know how the apparatus works, Mr. Crabtree.

36:25.480 --> 36:26.823
Otherwise, I would not be here.

36:26.848 --> 36:28.794
Yes, right, of course.

36:28.816 --> 36:30.591
So how does this work, then?

36:30.618 --> 36:33.155
Did you receive this imail?

36:33.188 --> 36:34.531
No.

36:34.556 --> 36:35.660
Oh, I see.

36:35.690 --> 36:38.637
It responds to a change in the heart rate.

36:38.660 --> 36:41.266
Very clever.

36:41.296 --> 36:44.607
Did you or did you not send this imail?

36:44.632 --> 36:46.509
I did not.

36:46.534 --> 36:48.275
And then the resulting change in pressure

36:48.303 --> 36:49.441
drives liquid up the tube.

36:49.470 --> 36:50.949
Fantastic.

36:50.972 --> 36:53.282
Please, just answer the question.

36:53.308 --> 36:56.221
I did not.

36:57.879 --> 36:59.222
May I buy this from you?

37:01.349 --> 37:02.555
I ask you again,

37:02.584 --> 37:06.259
did you or did you not send this
imail to your co-conspirators?

37:10.325 --> 37:11.599
That's it.

37:11.626 --> 37:12.604
I'm out.

37:12.627 --> 37:14.231
Wait, you should let me show you a pair

37:14.262 --> 37:15.900
of Detective Murdoch's
night vision goggles.

37:15.930 --> 37:16.931
They're-

37:16.965 --> 37:18.273
Good-bye, Mr. Crabtree.

37:21.703 --> 37:23.512
So now you think they're all innocent.

37:23.538 --> 37:25.882
I don't know what else to think, sir.

37:25.907 --> 37:28.285
We know at least one other
inventor was involved,

37:28.309 --> 37:30.255
the man who designed the primary switch.

37:30.278 --> 37:32.485
The switch that turns on the switch.

37:32.513 --> 37:34.857
Yes, I've seen nothing like
it in any invention, sir.

37:34.882 --> 37:36.657
I only know it's a
switch because of the way

37:36.684 --> 37:38.254
it's wired to the device.

37:38.286 --> 37:40.698
You think this person built the device,

37:40.722 --> 37:43.703
then constructed an elaborate
code to frame everyone else.

37:43.725 --> 37:45.898
It's a possibility.

37:45.927 --> 37:48.999
Now I just have to figure out
how to activate the switch.

37:49.030 --> 37:50.566
Time to go, Thomas.

37:53.668 --> 37:56.274
Ah, right, right.

37:56.304 --> 37:57.840
Higgins.

37:57.872 --> 37:58.873
Good luck, sir.

38:04.912 --> 38:05.913
Some mail, sir?

38:07.715 --> 38:10.696
Precisely 20 seconds, George.

38:10.718 --> 38:12.823
What's that?

38:12.854 --> 38:16.358
20 seconds from the time
the device was activated

38:16.391 --> 38:18.496
to the time it fired the shot.

38:18.526 --> 38:22.531
What happened 20 seconds prior

38:22.563 --> 38:24.941
to the shot being fired?

38:24.966 --> 38:27.606
Well, Schreyer was giving his speech, sir.

38:27.635 --> 38:30.013
His speech was 18 seconds.

38:30.038 --> 38:33.986
What happened 2 seconds
before he started to speak?

38:34.008 --> 38:36.545
Well, he blew his dog whistle.

38:57.799 --> 38:59.403
Well, he agreed to blow the dog whistle,

38:59.434 --> 39:01.641
and I wanted to test the frequency limits

39:01.669 --> 39:02.909
of my recorder.

39:02.937 --> 39:07.545
George, arrest Alexander Graham Bell.

39:18.519 --> 39:20.362
Higgins.

39:20.388 --> 39:21.696
What are you doing here?

39:21.723 --> 39:24.602
I don't think I'm supposed to say.

39:24.625 --> 39:27.697
Does this have anything
to do with the inspector?

39:27.729 --> 39:29.606
When he taps twice on the window,

39:29.630 --> 39:31.507
I'm gonna go in and say
there's been an emergency

39:31.532 --> 39:32.670
and that he's needed.

39:32.700 --> 39:35.044
- Avoiding the dentist, is he?
- Mm.

39:35.069 --> 39:37.379
Higgins, Detective Murdoch
has asked that you arrest

39:37.405 --> 39:39.043
Alexander Graham Bell at his hotel.

39:39.073 --> 39:40.416
I can't.

39:40.441 --> 39:41.784
I'll take care of your duties here.

39:41.809 --> 39:43.015
Well, why can't you arrest him?

39:43.044 --> 39:45.115
Oh, Higgins, I'm not a mind reader.

39:45.146 --> 39:46.921
I can't read the detective's mind.

39:46.948 --> 39:48.621
He said, "George, find Henry."

39:48.649 --> 39:50.128
"Have him arrest Alexander Graham Bell.

39:50.151 --> 39:51.994
He's at the Queens Hotel."

39:53.488 --> 39:54.694
Right away.

40:03.030 --> 40:05.032
Why are you always knocking on windows?

40:05.066 --> 40:08.843
That's just my way of saying,
"Let's get on with this."

40:08.870 --> 40:13.148
Do your worst, Doc.

40:13.174 --> 40:15.381
Sir...

40:15.410 --> 40:16.753
Crabtree.

40:16.778 --> 40:18.815
I just wanted to update you
on the status of the case.

40:18.846 --> 40:20.985
- Oh, well, I'd better come.
- That's not necessary, sir,

40:21.015 --> 40:22.858
but you should know that
we printed the imails.

40:22.884 --> 40:23.919
Oh, well, I should take a look.

40:23.951 --> 40:25.487
Again, that's not necessary, sir.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.796
The only damning one came from
Alexander Graham Bell's machine.

40:27.822 --> 40:28.823
Oh, well, we'd better arrest him.

40:28.856 --> 40:29.834
And that's what we're doing, sir.

40:29.857 --> 40:31.165
I've sent Higgins.

40:31.192 --> 40:34.805
Higgins?

40:34.829 --> 40:37.605
He seemed the right man for the job, sir.

40:39.434 --> 40:40.708
Best of luck with the tooth.

40:53.848 --> 40:56.192
What is this?

40:56.217 --> 40:58.026
A sonic switch.

40:58.052 --> 41:00.896
More accurately, a harmonic switch,

41:00.922 --> 41:02.924
which is activated at the precise frequency

41:02.957 --> 41:05.460
of 18,000 cycles per second,

41:05.493 --> 41:09.168
conveniently the same
frequency as your dog whistle.

41:11.098 --> 41:13.044
It was an ingenious plan:

41:13.067 --> 41:14.705
Build a sonic switch into a device

41:14.735 --> 41:16.840
and have Karl Schreyer trigger it himself.

41:16.871 --> 41:18.179
Brilliant.

41:18.206 --> 41:21.915
Wh-Why would I kill Karl?

41:21.943 --> 41:23.718
I was the only one that didn't hate him.

41:23.744 --> 41:25.451
So you made sure to tell me

41:25.480 --> 41:27.153
and then proceeded to insinuate yourself

41:27.181 --> 41:28.660
into my investigation.

41:28.683 --> 41:30.663
You invited me.

41:30.685 --> 41:31.993
Oh, did I'?

41:32.019 --> 41:34.056
As I recall, it was you who approached me

41:34.088 --> 41:37.467
and then told me about Karl
Schreyer's many enemies.

41:37.492 --> 41:39.802
It was you who told me
about the audio recording

41:39.827 --> 41:42.933
and volunteered your audiograph
to help me analyze it.

41:42.964 --> 41:45.808
So I helped you, and that makes me guilty?

41:45.833 --> 41:48.905
You manipulated me so that I
wouldn't come to the conclusion

41:48.936 --> 41:49.971
that I now have.

41:50.004 --> 41:51.813
And what is that?

41:51.839 --> 41:55.787
That you built it using parts
from many different inventors

41:55.810 --> 41:58.757
so that it would appear
that many different inventors

41:58.779 --> 42:01.623
conspired to kill Karl,
but it was you all along.

42:01.649 --> 42:03.151
By myself?

42:03.184 --> 42:05.494
You were the only
inventor at that convention

42:05.520 --> 42:07.124
capable of building such a device.

42:07.154 --> 42:10.260
You were certainly the only
inventor capable of building

42:10.291 --> 42:12.931
a sonic switch.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.496
But, Detective, why would I do this?

42:14.529 --> 42:16.065
Why would I kill Karl?

42:16.097 --> 42:17.940
Why would I go to so much trouble

42:17.965 --> 42:19.911
to frame my fellow inventors,

42:19.934 --> 42:22.540
people whom I respect and admire?

42:22.570 --> 42:24.743
Then how do you explain
the fact that the device

42:24.772 --> 42:29.243
was triggered by a whistle you
asked Karl Schreyer to blow?

42:29.277 --> 42:31.553
Detective, I didn't ask
Karl to blow the whistle.

42:31.579 --> 42:36.050
He suggested it as part of his speech.

42:36.083 --> 42:39.257
Why would he do that?

42:39.287 --> 42:41.893
Unless...

42:47.728 --> 42:50.834
Dr. Grace, have you
completed your post-mortem?

42:50.865 --> 42:52.242
I have.

42:52.266 --> 42:54.246
Did you find anything unusual?

42:54.268 --> 42:56.714
As a matter of fact, I did.

42:56.737 --> 43:00.150
I determined the cause of death
to be a gunshot to the head,

43:00.174 --> 43:02.745
and normally I would have
concluded my post-mortem

43:02.777 --> 43:03.812
at that point.

43:03.844 --> 43:05.084
But as you might remember,

43:05.112 --> 43:06.750
I noticed that his eyes were jaundiced.

43:06.781 --> 43:08.158
Yes.

43:08.182 --> 43:10.059
Which is caused by an excess of bilirubin.

43:10.084 --> 43:13.293
In newborns, it's quite
normal, but in adults-

43:13.321 --> 43:15.801
- Doctor, if you could get to the point.

43:15.823 --> 43:17.598
Yes, yes.

43:17.625 --> 43:20.265
I dissected the liver, and
that's where I found it.

43:20.294 --> 43:21.830
Found what?

43:21.862 --> 43:24.069
The tumor was as large as my fist.

43:24.098 --> 43:26.874
So Karl Schreyer was dying.

43:26.901 --> 43:28.710
He had a month or two at most.

43:28.736 --> 43:30.647
He would have been in quite some pain.

43:30.671 --> 43:33.015
I don't know if any of this is relevant.

43:47.355 --> 43:49.699
Actually, Doctor, you've
helped to confirm my theory.

43:49.724 --> 43:51.761
Thank you.

43:51.792 --> 43:55.330
Are you telling us that Karl made this?

43:55.363 --> 43:57.274
And then used it to kill himself?

43:57.298 --> 43:58.868
Is it patented?

43:58.899 --> 44:00.708
I believe he built the device himself

44:00.735 --> 44:03.181
using knowledge he gleaned from his spy...

44:03.204 --> 44:05.309
So that's what he was doing all this time.

44:05.339 --> 44:08.149
And then sent coded
imails to make it appear

44:08.175 --> 44:09.916
you were all conspiring to kill him.

44:09.944 --> 44:10.922
Bastard.

44:10.945 --> 44:12.288
He sent us to hang?

44:12.313 --> 44:14.384
- So it would appear.
- And wait a minute.

44:14.415 --> 44:16.415
All of this is contingent
on you finding the device

44:16.417 --> 44:17.896
and deciphering the code.

44:17.918 --> 44:19.795
How would he know that you would succeed?

44:19.820 --> 44:22.824
Well, I imagine he knew
Detective Murdoch by reputation.

44:22.857 --> 44:25.303
I mean, he did ask specifically
for you, did he not?

44:25.326 --> 44:27.203
He did, yes.

44:27.228 --> 44:29.367
But then why would he assume
you wouldn't figure it out,

44:29.397 --> 44:31.274
as you so clearly have done?

44:31.298 --> 44:34.108
I suppose that was a calculated risk.

44:34.135 --> 44:36.274
Or maybe it didn't matter.

44:36.303 --> 44:38.112
Maybe all he wanted was to force us

44:38.139 --> 44:40.710
to acknowledge his genius.

44:40.741 --> 44:43.745
May I?

44:52.687 --> 44:54.689
Well, he was that,

44:54.722 --> 44:56.827
a genius.

44:56.857 --> 45:00.031
Which one of us could have made this?

45:10.071 --> 45:12.950
Oh, I could have.

45:16.877 --> 45:18.288
Be careful with that, Worseley, now.

45:18.312 --> 45:20.883
That's somebody's invention.

45:20.915 --> 45:22.690
Crabtree.

45:22.717 --> 45:25.027
How was the dentist, sir?

45:25.052 --> 45:27.726
Worst pain I've ever experienced.

45:27.755 --> 45:29.598
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

45:29.623 --> 45:31.068
How does your tooth feel now?

45:31.092 --> 45:32.628
Better.

45:32.660 --> 45:34.401
I suppose I have you to thank for that.

45:34.428 --> 45:37.705
Oh, sir, no thanks necessary.

45:37.732 --> 45:39.370
You've got guts, Crabtree.

45:39.400 --> 45:42.677
Not much in the way of
brains, but you do have guts.

45:44.972 --> 45:47.475
Oh, thank you, Detective.
It's nice to have it back.

45:47.508 --> 45:49.317
Thank you.

45:49.343 --> 45:51.789
I don't think I could have
solved this without your help.

45:51.812 --> 45:53.382
Oh, I doubt that's true.

45:53.414 --> 45:56.725
And I'm sorry for
accusing you the way I did.

45:56.751 --> 45:59.061
Oh, now, I'd have done
the same in your shoes.

45:59.086 --> 46:00.895
Good-bye, Mr. Bell.

46:00.921 --> 46:03.765
You know, I'm staying in
Toronto for a couple of weeks.

46:03.791 --> 46:05.566
We should go for dinner.

46:05.593 --> 46:08.904
Inventors need to talk to other inventors.

46:08.929 --> 46:11.000
Oh, of course.

46:11.031 --> 46:12.135
All right.

46:14.635 --> 46:15.670
George.

46:17.138 --> 46:19.140
I understand your investor backed out.

46:19.173 --> 46:21.619
She was convinced the
Truthizer didn't work.

46:21.642 --> 46:23.519
Well, ironically, it did work.

46:23.544 --> 46:25.148
Oh, I know.

46:25.179 --> 46:28.319
This is quite the invention, sir,

46:28.349 --> 46:31.159
creating a sound to activate a switch.

46:31.185 --> 46:34.029
Imagine if one day you could
switch the lights on by-

46:34.054 --> 46:36.261
I don't know
- clapping your hands.

46:36.290 --> 46:38.050
Well, it would be
brilliant for the bedridden

46:38.058 --> 46:40.868
or the infirm or just the unusually lazy.

46:42.696 --> 46:45.836
Well, maybe you should
invent it, George, hmm?

46:48.502 --> 46:50.140
Perhaps I will.
