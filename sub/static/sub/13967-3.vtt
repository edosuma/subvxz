(flies buzzing)

01:36.263 --> 01:38.330
Still not hungry?

01:42.403 --> 01:45.804
So no eating, no talking.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.075
Suit yourself.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.511
How is any of this
 my fault?

01:55.116 --> 01:57.649
What did I do to you?

01:58.886 --> 02:00.419
Tell me.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.950
What did you do?

02:01.950 --> 02:04.323
You were born.

02:04.325 --> 02:07.092
Born an Al Fayeed.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.995
You are here because of
what your family did to mine.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.965
My father's trying
to change that.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.400
You think you know
 your father?

02:15.402 --> 02:17.035
You don't.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.575
He killed my wife.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.070
My beautiful Samira.

02:26.070 --> 02:27.446
She was...

02:27.448 --> 02:30.516
well, she was
not much older than you are.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.351
(scoffs) No.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.620
That's a lie.

02:34.622 --> 02:35.988
You're a liar.

02:35.990 --> 02:39.358
Your father is the liar.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.720
Your uncle, 
your grandfather...

02:43.720 --> 02:45.230
at least they were honest
about who they were,

02:45.230 --> 02:47.166
what they were.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.001
But your father...

02:49.003 --> 02:50.600
(Sheik Abdullah) Ihab?

02:59.680 --> 03:03.050
Molly Al Fayeed
told Al-Qadi

03:03.050 --> 03:05.884
that she's willing to trade
herself for her daughter.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.786
Bassam will allow this?

03:07.788 --> 03:10.822
She hasn't told him.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.291
(Barry)<i> You have a carrier</i>

03:12.293 --> 03:14.190
in the Gulf
and a drone base in Djibouti,

03:14.190 --> 03:15.661
so tell me
what I'm missing, General.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.530
Good intel, Mr. President.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.290
Without boots on the ground,

03:19.290 --> 03:21.300
our eyes in the sky
just don't know where to look.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.230
And you have
no new intelligence?

03:23.230 --> 03:26.270
Our assets are limited
inside Caliphate territory.

03:26.270 --> 03:28.340
(Leila) I spoke to the Syrians.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.342
Same answer.

03:30.344 --> 03:33.345
So what you're all saying
is we can't rescue my daughter.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.740
Not before Rashid's deadline.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.986
Maybe I can buy some time,
offer him something else.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.490
Money, weapons?

03:43.490 --> 03:45.924
You're not dealing with
a rational human being.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.859
He doesn't value anything.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.494
Except killing your wife.

03:49.496 --> 03:52.930
If he wants revenge,
why can't he just kill me?

03:52.930 --> 03:54.733
Because it's not just
revenge they're after.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.930
Rashid and the Sheik want
to draw you into a fight,

03:57.930 --> 04:00.100
playing up the notion
that you're an American,

04:00.100 --> 04:02.040
hellbent on restarting
the Crusades.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.040
Calling you an American,

04:04.040 --> 04:06.410
picking a fight
to destabilize this democracy

04:06.410 --> 04:09.281
you're trying to build...
it's only about one thing.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.083
They want Abuddin.

04:11.085 --> 04:14.052
(Hamila on microphone)<i> These people
 who took</i><i> Emma Al Fayeed,</i>

04:14.054 --> 04:16.589
they live in
 a modern world,

04:16.589 --> 04:19.291
but they're stuck
in a medieval past.

04:19.293 --> 04:23.460
They view our freedom,
our prosperity, our hopefulness

04:23.460 --> 04:26.360
as a threat
to their outdated ways.

04:26.360 --> 04:29.034
That is their problem,
 not ours...

04:29.036 --> 04:30.936
- because... (speech in background)
- I'm just checking if he's okay.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.571
Wishing his family well.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.539
"His family"?

04:34.541 --> 04:36.375
You mean the Al Fayeeds.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.976
Like we're old friends.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.279
We don't hang
out together.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.810
You should be careful
not to overstep.

04:42.810 --> 04:44.316
He's my student.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.950
It's fine for me to care
about his well-being.

04:47.950 --> 04:49.755
Just...

04:49.757 --> 04:52.190
pay attention to the speech.

04:52.190 --> 04:54.690
(Halima) Peace is their enemy.

04:54.690 --> 04:56.395
So they resort to violence,

04:56.397 --> 04:59.998
thinking that we will resort
to violence ourselves.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.267
But we will not be
 drawn in.

05:02.269 --> 05:05.337
As we pray for
 Emma Al Fayeed,

05:05.339 --> 05:08.473
we stand with her father,
our President,

05:08.475 --> 05:11.310
in facing violence
with forgiveness...

05:11.312 --> 05:13.545
(crowd gasps, murmurs)

05:18.585 --> 05:19.985
(door opens)

05:19.987 --> 05:22.320
(footsteps approaching)

05:25.259 --> 05:27.159
Did you sleep?

05:29.430 --> 05:32.030
I, uh,
I slept in the other room.

05:32.030 --> 05:33.899
I didn't want to disturb you.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.104
Molly?

05:39.106 --> 05:41.873
What?

05:41.875 --> 05:44.009
We have nothing to say.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.380
You decided.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.684
Molly...

05:52.686 --> 05:55.387
Doctor's here.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.688
Mom?

05:59.326 --> 06:01.126
- This way.
- Hello.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.296
- Please.
- Thank you.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.266
Sammy.

06:14.508 --> 06:17.570
I know this is
unbearable for you.

06:19.179 --> 06:22.414
Remember Ma'an?

06:22.416 --> 06:24.649
Ihab was bleeding.

06:24.651 --> 06:28.353
I told you to let him die,
but you didn't.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.322
You saved his life.

06:32.326 --> 06:34.393
Yes.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.296
Then you let him go.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.068
Sammy, I can't undo
what's been done.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.504
No, you can't.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.580
(monitor beeping)
(doctor) The infection came on last night.

06:58.580 --> 06:59.680
We're keeping it in check

06:59.680 --> 07:02.254
with a course of
full-spectrum antibiotics,

07:02.256 --> 07:05.457
but his surviving kidney has
sustained significant damage.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.420
How significant?

07:07.420 --> 07:09.961
It's functioning at five
percent, even on dialysis.

07:09.963 --> 07:13.698
Effectively, he's facing
total renal failure.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.535
So he needs a kidney.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.937
We can talk about
that later.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.639
I need to go back
to the War Room.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.241
A transplant would
save his life.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.877
A child often
has the best odds

07:25.879 --> 07:28.713
of matching
with a parent.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.782
I don't know
how I feel about that.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.950
Is that a terrible thing
for me to say?

07:32.950 --> 07:36.080
Under the circumstances, Ahmed.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.320
(Dr. Elatrache)<i> There is still</i>

07:40.320 --> 07:43.395
a thin shadow along
the left hemisphere, see?

07:44.932 --> 07:47.860
So I'd like you
to take another MRI

07:47.860 --> 07:49.400
sometime in the next
12 hours.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.670
I don't think
 I'm gonna do that.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.970
Well, if you're feeling nausea
along with the headaches...

07:54.970 --> 07:58.009
(phone vibrating)
Excuse me.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.578
Hello?

07:59.580 --> 08:02.047

 to me?

08:02.047 --> 08:05.040

08:09.923 --> 08:12.290
Who is this?

08:12.292 --> 08:14.526
Ihab Rashid.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.428
Prove it.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.164
(Emma) Mom?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.599
(gasps)

08:20.601 --> 08:22.367
Emma. Are you okay?

08:22.369 --> 08:24.436
Did he hurt you?

08:24.438 --> 08:25.871
I'm okay.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.839
Listen to me, I am gonna
get you out of there.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.041
Okay? I promise. I promise.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.810
Emma? Emma?

08:31.812 --> 08:33.378
You told Sheik Al-Qadi

08:33.380 --> 08:34.946
that you would trade yourself
for your daughter.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.214
Yes.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.518
Your husband,
does he know about this?

08:39.520 --> 08:41.152
(sighs) No.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.621
You would betray him
 so easily?

08:43.624 --> 08:45.490
I am a mother.

08:45.492 --> 08:48.026
Tell me what I have to do
to get my daughter back.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.590
Tomorrow, 1800,

08:49.590 --> 08:51.560
El Deir Square.
You wear a blue hijab.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.864
Someone will take you
to the border.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.200
Your daughter will be there.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.302
Why should I trust you?

08:57.304 --> 09:00.872
1800, El Deir Square.
(phone beeps)

09:00.874 --> 09:02.741
Wait.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.154
What are you talking about?

10:23.156 --> 10:24.556
Of course you can.

10:24.550 --> 10:27.826
I have to get away.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.328

10:30.330 --> 10:33.431
should be with my family
right now, but...

10:33.433 --> 10:35.600
Did something happen?

10:35.602 --> 10:36.801
No.

10:39.072 --> 10:42.307
But it can't be good. (shivering)

10:52.619 --> 10:55.420
It's okay.

10:55.422 --> 10:58.189
It's okay, hmm?

10:58.191 --> 11:01.493
You can stay here
for a while.

11:01.495 --> 11:04.690

And God, (door opens)
an insurer of the cows...

11:29.556 --> 11:31.990
(Hanif) I think you have
 the wrong room.

11:31.990 --> 11:34.426
I need to speak to your sister,
Hanif.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.696
We have nothing
to talk about.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.290
We know what you think.

11:39.290 --> 11:40.899
You tell everyone.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.801
You cleaned yourself up.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.937
This is what you do to people
who disagree with you?

11:47.340 --> 11:48.740
You're celebrating this,
aren't you?

11:48.742 --> 11:50.170
What the Caliphate is doing.

11:50.170 --> 11:51.610
We're just studying Koran.

11:51.610 --> 11:52.477
It's terrorism.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.180
Arab against Arab.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.480
(Mahdiya) The girl is not Arab.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.681
She's American.

11:56.683 --> 11:57.982
They're all Americans.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.418
Is that really your response?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.420
(Hanif) If...

12:02.422 --> 12:04.856
the government brings in
the American military

12:04.858 --> 12:08.920
to do their dirty work,
worse things will happen

12:08.920 --> 12:11.029
than you getting
shit thrown at you.

12:11.031 --> 12:14.466
Or one foreign girl
being kidnapped.

12:22.060 --> 12:25.060
(generic traffic noise)

12:25.060 --> 12:28.060
(indistinct chatting in distance)
(dialing tone)

12:31.518 --> 12:34.452
I need to speak to an officer.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.421
Yes, I want to report a threat.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.289
Someone is making threats
against the President

12:38.291 --> 12:40.425
and the First Family.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.427
His name...

12:42.429 --> 12:45.330
is Hanif Kattan.

12:45.530 --> 12:48.530
(low hum of chat)

12:48.530 --> 12:51.530
(car passing nearby)

12:52.139 --> 12:54.038
(Fauzi) Sorry.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.608
There's a session today?

12:57.744 --> 13:00.512
We have to show
that life goes on.

13:01.815 --> 13:02.981
We haven't met.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.550
My name is...

13:04.550 --> 13:07.085
I... I... I know
 who you are.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.721
Bassam told me
you came to see him.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.790
Please come inside.

13:15.729 --> 13:18.830
I feel as if I don't deserve
to be here today.

13:20.433 --> 13:24.002
'Cause no matter
 how hard I try,

13:24.004 --> 13:26.971
I can't seem to bring myself
to forgive.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.678
Maybe today is not
 the time.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.150
But you were there
when my daughter died.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.550
Could you please
talk to me about her?

13:43.550 --> 13:45.924
I knew her for six hours.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.193
Right.

13:48.195 --> 13:51.029
I was her hostage.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.666
Okay.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.203
I'm sorry.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.940
You don't have to...

14:03.109 --> 14:05.010
I thought...

14:05.010 --> 14:07.645
she seemed very noble,

14:07.647 --> 14:10.315
in a way.

14:10.317 --> 14:13.580
She was so... broken apart

14:13.580 --> 14:16.187
by what life
had taken away from her.

14:19.125 --> 14:22.627
I think she was as scared of
the gun in her hand as we were.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.630
Of course she was.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.165
If you would've known her...

14:27.167 --> 14:30.802
Still...

14:30.804 --> 14:33.030
she made a choice.

14:34.040 --> 14:38.243
I don't know if Bassam told you,
but she killed a man.

14:38.245 --> 14:42.013
A resistance fighter
named Nimr.

14:42.015 --> 14:46.050
She shot him in front of us, and
then she pointed her gun at me.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.822
Whether you can
forgive him or not,

14:50.824 --> 14:53.091
it's for your own heart.

14:54.861 --> 14:59.430
But I really believe that if
Bassam could relive the moment,

14:59.432 --> 15:01.890
he would rather
have died himself.

15:05.839 --> 15:08.239
All of us are victims.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.900
The dead and the living.

15:18.385 --> 15:19.884
(over phone) This is Sammy.

15:19.886 --> 15:22.053
Leave a message
and I'll call you back.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.789
(sighs)

15:24.791 --> 15:27.320
Oh, where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.394
I was out.
Is there news?

15:29.396 --> 15:31.296
No, no, I just wanted
to see you.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.563
Okay.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.600
Okay. I love you.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.869
I love you, too.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.938
I just want you to know,

15:39.940 --> 15:43.908
whatever happens,
you're my baby, too,

15:43.910 --> 15:45.977
and I love you very much.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.548
I know that.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.886
I need to call Halima.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.550
Tell her what's going on.

15:56.550 --> 15:57.455
Okay.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.957
I'll see you at dinner.

15:59.950 --> 16:02.950
(birds chirping)

16:03.930 --> 16:05.296
(sighs)

16:10.470 --> 16:12.603
(Molly recorded) I am a mother.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.139
Tell me what I have to do
to get my daughter back.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.510
(Ihab) Tomorrow, 1800.
 El Deir Square.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.770
You wear a blue hijab.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.178
Someone will take you
to the border.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.980
Your daughter will be there.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.949
It was Al-Qadi who put her
in touch with Ihab.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.351
How do you know?

16:26.353 --> 16:28.419
I've had him 
under surveillance.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.689
One of my men claims he saw
Mrs. Al Fayeed in his house.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.791
(Maloof) Siddiq came to me

16:33.793 --> 16:36.094
and I brought in
General Cogswell.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.029
(Barry) Doesn't make any sense.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.690
He was joining the council.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.290
My Signals
Intelligence people

16:41.290 --> 16:43.468
sifted through
Al-Qadi's phone calls,

16:43.470 --> 16:46.371
and they came up
with that.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.306
Where are you
going, sir?

16:48.308 --> 16:50.842
Make sure my wife doesn't get
anywhere near El Deir Square.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.478
(Maloof) Or you could let her go.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.513
What?

16:55.515 --> 16:58.149
Let her go to Ihab Rashid.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.917
You're insane.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.788
I think
 you should hear us out.

17:06.119 --> 17:07.460
(Molly)<i> Where's my car?</i>

17:07.460 --> 17:09.720
- It should be here by now.
- I'm sorry, Madam First Lady.

17:09.720 --> 17:10.630
They're bringing it
around now.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.760
You said that
 five minutes ago.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.364
I want my car.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.866
(exhales)

17:17.369 --> 17:19.369
(Barry) Molly.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.239
Uh...

17:21.241 --> 17:23.808
- Barry, I can't talk right now. I have to go.
- Molly.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.344
- I'm... going to pray for Emma at St. Simeon.
- Molly. Molly...

17:26.346 --> 17:27.744
I won't be long.
I'll be right back, please.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.514
Molly, I can't let
you go to Ihab.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.682
What?

17:31.684 --> 17:34.318
I know where
you're going.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.853
(chuckles softly)

17:35.855 --> 17:37.655
So now
 you're spying on me, too?

17:37.657 --> 17:39.023
(sighs)

17:39.025 --> 17:40.758
You are so brave.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.730
You have to let me go.

17:44.730 --> 17:45.960
I can't.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.099
Not the way
 you want me to.

17:50.503 --> 17:54.172
We'll drop you here,
two blocks from El Deir Square.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.840
And my team will be there,

17:55.842 --> 17:57.740
so when Rashid's man
approaches you,

17:57.740 --> 17:59.110
we'll grab him.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.879
Once he tells us where
that exchange will take place,

18:01.881 --> 18:04.580
our high-altitude drone
will monitor the traffic

18:04.580 --> 18:06.017
going to the location.

18:06.019 --> 18:09.020
And my Special Forces team
will insert over the border

18:09.022 --> 18:11.089
and intercept.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.759
(Cogswell) Do you have
 any questions?

18:14.761 --> 18:17.395
This man who's supposed
to bring me to Rashid,

18:17.397 --> 18:19.831
what makes you so sure
he'll cooperate?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.601
I can be very persuasive.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.072
Okay.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.874
Whatever you need to do.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.943
We should go.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.886
You okay?

18:41.888 --> 18:43.354
You ready?

18:43.354 --> 18:45.350
(Molly breaths deeply)

19:01.407 --> 19:04.408
(van doors closing)

19:11.451 --> 19:13.651
You think I should
let him die?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.880
You don't even know
if you're a compatible donor.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.355
That's not the point.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.550
Do I think you should put

19:19.550 --> 19:22.426
your life and health at risk
for that man?

19:24.030 --> 19:26.297
No, I don't.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.630
In light of everything

19:27.630 --> 19:28.766
that's going on around here,

19:28.768 --> 19:31.202
what a remarkable
statement that is.

19:33.039 --> 19:38.240
Was there even a single moment
of affection between you two?

19:38.240 --> 19:42.380
Because honestly,
I can't even remember one.

19:44.017 --> 19:47.510
Why did you even
marry him?

19:49.322 --> 19:52.223
I had no choice.

19:52.225 --> 19:55.826
I was a girl.
We were promised to each other.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.390
My parents worked in the Palace
for your grandfather.

19:58.390 --> 20:02.000
My sister and I
spent our days

20:02.000 --> 20:04.368
hiding behind curtains,

20:04.370 --> 20:07.405
dreaming of being princesses.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.874
He decided he wanted me.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.411
Your grandparents
weren't pleased, but...

20:13.413 --> 20:15.746
they had already
denied him once, so...

20:17.050 --> 20:19.217
Did you ever love him?

20:19.217 --> 20:21.210
(glass clinks)

20:23.590 --> 20:25.189
I tried.

20:25.191 --> 20:28.826
Did you ever love anyone?

20:31.197 --> 20:32.630
I love you.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.770
Yes.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.840
I loved someone, once.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.743
But it was 
a very long time ago.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.440
Who?

20:48.440 --> 20:51.015
Doesn't matter. He left.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.056
(sniffs)

20:59.058 --> 21:01.859
Despite everything...

21:01.861 --> 21:05.429
I want to love my father.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.964
I'm going to try.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.599
Ahmed.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.035
(footsteps receding)
(door opens)

21:11.037 --> 21:12.970
(Kifah)<i> I don't know</i>

21:12.970 --> 21:14.605
where he first saw me.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.240
Maybe in the shop.

21:16.242 --> 21:19.110
I work as a clerk,
selling candy,

21:19.112 --> 21:21.245
magazines.

21:21.247 --> 21:24.450
One day, a commander
visited my parents

21:24.450 --> 21:26.880
and told them
that I had been chosen

21:26.880 --> 21:29.220
to be the wife
of a Caliphate fighter.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.150
Are your parents
here today?

21:32.150 --> 21:33.420
Yes.

21:33.420 --> 21:35.393
They are sitting over there.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.665
When I first met Walid,

21:40.667 --> 21:43.501
(over speakers) I thought
 he was an ugly man.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.836
He had such big hands,

21:45.838 --> 21:48.606
and bad breath.

21:48.608 --> 21:52.476
From that day on,
I never saw my family.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.113
I put on my Niqab.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.982
I disappeared.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.250
Every morning,

22:01.250 --> 22:05.122
he would make me go down
 on him.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.792
He said it took him
 to paradise.

22:07.794 --> 22:10.290
And every night,

22:10.290 --> 22:12.496
he would take me to bed.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.699
Silent.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.500
He would do his business

22:16.500 --> 22:19.236
and fall asleep on me
like a baby.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.509
Do you need some time?

22:25.511 --> 22:27.578
No.

22:29.048 --> 22:33.317
I never knew what he did
when he left our house.

22:33.319 --> 22:36.454
I didn't want
to think about that.

22:36.456 --> 22:40.124
After a few weeks,
he started to talk.

22:40.126 --> 22:43.027
I hated him,

22:43.029 --> 22:46.330
but he was nice to me.

22:46.332 --> 22:49.633
He told me my face
made him happy.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.872
I had nothing else in my life.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.008
After a while,

22:58.010 --> 22:59.744
I missed him during the day

22:59.746 --> 23:02.680
and waited for him
 to come home.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.480
Isn't that strange?

23:04.480 --> 23:05.880
(sniffling)

23:05.880 --> 23:08.786
And then the battle came,
and he never...

23:10.990 --> 23:13.758
(crying) I don't know
 if he got away,

23:13.760 --> 23:16.260
or if he is dead.

23:16.260 --> 23:19.990
(sobbing)

23:19.999 --> 23:24.034
But I have his baby... 
in here.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.270
I have 

23:26.272 --> 23:29.073
no idea
 what will happen to us.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.375
I can not marry again.

23:31.377 --> 23:33.177
Who would ever have me

23:33.179 --> 23:35.410
and my half-Caliphate child?

23:35.410 --> 23:38.682
Who will ever forgive me?

23:41.087 --> 23:43.421
Why do you need to be forgiven?

23:43.423 --> 23:47.591
Because I'm soiled.

23:47.593 --> 23:52.096
And because there
is something wrong with me.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.765
I mourn for him.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.803
And that makes my heart
a traitor.

24:05.445 --> 24:08.112
<i>(woman) We have so much shame,</i>
<i> you know.</i>

24:08.114 --> 24:11.250
A woman can not help give
her body when it is taken,

24:11.250 --> 24:13.417
but she should never
give her heart.

24:13.419 --> 24:15.486
My daughter fell in love.

24:16.220 --> 24:20.324
I have to find a way to
forgive her for a great crime.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.827
You have to forgive yours
for a little one.

24:26.432 --> 24:27.865
(man) Thank you.

24:27.865 --> 24:31.860
(indistinct chat in background)

24:35.741 --> 24:38.175
Any word from the Palace?

24:38.177 --> 24:40.878
Nothing, no news.

24:43.015 --> 24:46.150
If you can fit an extra seat
at the dinner table,

24:46.152 --> 24:48.886
I could use the company tonight.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.758

25:30.196 --> 25:32.563
(operative on comms) She's made contact.

25:39.171 --> 25:43.541
Before I move in,
I need confirmation he's alone.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.142
(over radio) We're still
 scanning, sir.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.377
Hurry up.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.216
Get in.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.550
First show me proof
my daughter's alive.

25:54.550 --> 25:56.280
You'll see your daughter
soon enough.

25:56.280 --> 25:57.388
I want proof now.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.790
Get in the car,
Mrs. Al Fayeed.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.699
Five of my snipers have
your head in their scopes,

26:08.701 --> 26:10.200
so listen to me carefully,

26:10.202 --> 26:12.570
unless you want your brains
all over the street.

26:30.590 --> 26:33.190
"Farook Khalif."

26:33.192 --> 26:36.427
So, tell me,
Farook Khalif,

26:36.429 --> 26:39.296
where are you supposed
to take Mrs. Al Fayeed?

26:39.298 --> 26:41.632
I don't know.

26:41.634 --> 26:42.933
You don't know.

26:42.930 --> 26:47.037
I was supposed to call 
when I have her in custody.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.139
Ihab will give me
further instructions.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.474
Then call.

26:50.476 --> 26:52.109
Tell him you have
Mrs. Al Fayeed.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.240
(phone clatters on floor)

26:57.240 --> 26:58.810
He's not in the
database, sir.

26:58.810 --> 26:59.950
There are more of us

26:59.950 --> 27:01.752
than you can ever
put on your lists.

27:01.754 --> 27:04.421
So, help me God,
I will kill you!

27:04.423 --> 27:05.850
- Take her outside.
- (Molly screaming)

27:05.850 --> 27:07.550
No, he has my daughter!

27:07.550 --> 27:08.592
My daughter!

27:08.594 --> 27:10.894
(Molly crying in distance)

27:10.896 --> 27:12.930
One more chance.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.798
You call Ihab.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.934
You tell him you
have Mrs. Al Fayeed.

27:16.936 --> 27:21.872
I will die before
I betray Ihab Rashid.

27:24.143 --> 27:27.010
It says here your
daughters' names

27:27.010 --> 27:29.647
are Suhail and Dina.

27:31.417 --> 27:34.018
I'm going to bring
them both here.

27:34.020 --> 27:38.490
You can watch while my men rape
them, and you'll watch me put

27:38.490 --> 27:40.024
a bullet in each
of their brains

27:40.026 --> 27:42.660
before I put
a bullet in yours.

27:42.662 --> 27:45.462
And you think I won't?

27:45.464 --> 27:48.766
Would have shocked me,
too, yesterday.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.668
But today, we all seem to be

27:50.670 --> 27:53.704
in the business of murdering
each other's families...

27:53.706 --> 27:56.106
don't we, Farook?

28:04.400 --> 28:07.400
(exhales sharply)

28:12.725 --> 28:15.225

28:36.810 --> 28:41.810

Hey.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.850
I think it'll always
surprise me to see you pray.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.157
You still believe...

29:53.159 --> 29:54.458
in God?

29:54.460 --> 29:56.627
With everything
that's happening?

29:59.598 --> 30:02.166
I'm trying.

30:13.779 --> 30:15.846
I'm sorry for what
I said earlier.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.384
I know we're all trying.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.455
What are you looking at?

30:58.457 --> 31:00.023
Hmm?

31:00.025 --> 31:02.292
You never seen
a Muslim man pray before?

31:02.294 --> 31:04.962
My father prays.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.464
You should pray.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.330
I would if I were you.

31:09.330 --> 31:10.868
Really?

31:10.870 --> 31:12.703
Why should I do that?

31:12.705 --> 31:14.805
Why pray to God?

31:14.807 --> 31:17.875
So you can be prepared.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.970
Depending on how 
this goes,

31:19.970 --> 31:21.445
you may see him soon.

31:25.818 --> 31:28.252
I don't think so.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.053
You don't go anywhere
when you die.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.755
You just stop.

31:31.757 --> 31:34.591
I feel sorry for you.

31:34.593 --> 31:37.360
Don't believe in anything.

31:37.360 --> 31:38.862
You believe in...

31:38.864 --> 31:41.164
your shoes...

31:41.166 --> 31:42.232
the clothes you buy.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.067
I believe in leaving people be.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.830
Why should I apologize
to you for that?

31:46.830 --> 31:49.840
You believe in a God that
wants you to kill people.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.742
How sick is that?

31:51.744 --> 31:55.180
For your information,
I do not kill for God.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.880
I kill to survive,
so I can worship my God.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.216
Bullshit.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.610
It's all in your head.

32:00.610 --> 32:01.620
There is no war between

32:01.620 --> 32:02.920
- me and you.
- Oh, yes.

32:02.920 --> 32:03.920
Yes, there is.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.690
Then let's make peace.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.396
You don't really want that.

32:12.398 --> 32:15.132
You don't kill to survive.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.968
You kill to feel alive.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.372
That's why I feel sorry for you.

32:22.374 --> 32:24.441
(phone rings)

32:27.040 --> 32:29.048
(phone beeps)

32:29.048 --> 32:30.180
Ihab.

32:31.216 --> 32:33.884
This is Khalif.

32:33.886 --> 32:36.119
Do you have her?

32:36.121 --> 32:38.088
Khalif.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.590
Yes, sir.

32:39.590 --> 32:41.224
She is with me now.

32:41.226 --> 32:42.626
Good.

32:42.628 --> 32:45.162
Take her to the crossing
outside Tal Areet.

32:45.162 --> 32:47.160
(phone beeps)

32:47.967 --> 32:49.299
Come!

32:49.301 --> 32:50.334
Get her.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.836
Apparently,

32:52.838 --> 32:56.073
your mother loves you more
than your father does.

33:04.950 --> 33:07.150
The President and First Family

33:07.150 --> 33:09.686
appreciate your
prayers and wishes.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.823
But due to the sensitive nature
of the situation,

33:12.825 --> 33:14.700
the Palace will have no further

33:14.700 --> 33:16.893
comment for the duration
of the crisis.

33:16.893 --> 33:18.890
(clicks remoter)

33:21.867 --> 33:24.701
I wish I could be
there with them.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.830
He knows you love him.

33:27.830 --> 33:30.607
He knows I love him, too.

33:30.609 --> 33:33.443
I think.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.613
Despite everything,
we were best friends once.

33:37.616 --> 33:40.183
He knows...

33:40.185 --> 33:43.286
about both of us.

33:43.288 --> 33:45.622
Anyway...

33:45.624 --> 33:48.959
I apologize for
inviting myself over.

33:48.961 --> 33:51.061
It's not a night
to be alone.

33:51.063 --> 33:55.730
And this was
my first home-cooked meal

33:55.730 --> 33:56.800
since I can remember.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.237
Was it okay for you?

34:00.239 --> 34:04.574
Does this look like the face
of a man who's disappointed?

34:04.576 --> 34:08.011
No home-cooked meals?

34:08.013 --> 34:10.914
How long have
you been a widow?

34:10.916 --> 34:12.382
16 years.

34:14.219 --> 34:17.554
My wife died of cancer
when Samira was four.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.158
I'm sorry.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.862
What was her name?

34:25.864 --> 34:27.664
Basma.

34:27.666 --> 34:30.033
She was a lawyer.

34:30.034 --> 34:32.936
We met when she was 15.

34:32.938 --> 34:34.538
I wish I had a picture.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.639
Samira looked so much
 like her.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.810
She was, in almost every way,
like her mother.

34:42.281 --> 34:45.482
Samira wasn't always...

34:50.621 --> 34:52.589
I raised my daughter alone.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.025
Maybe if she'd had a mother...

34:56.027 --> 34:58.695
Don't do that.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.936
You never thought
about marrying again?

35:05.938 --> 35:08.105
In all those years?

35:08.107 --> 35:10.240
I thought about it...

35:10.242 --> 35:12.776
but no one was Basma.

35:19.485 --> 35:20.984
And how about you?

35:20.986 --> 35:23.253
How long has your
husband been gone?

35:23.255 --> 35:25.088
Ahmos?

35:25.090 --> 35:27.157
Almost five months now.

35:28.994 --> 35:32.295
He was older than I am...

35:32.297 --> 35:34.898
but I gave him a son.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.600
And a wonderful son,

35:36.600 --> 35:38.268
from what I could
tell from dinner.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.337
Thank you.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.978
So, no more marriages
 for you?

35:50.249 --> 35:53.016
I think about it but...

35:53.018 --> 35:55.018
I don't see how.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.087
Really?

35:57.089 --> 35:59.156
I would think you'd
just point and choose.

36:03.295 --> 36:06.296
I don't have time
to worry about that.

36:06.298 --> 36:08.965
The world hasn't
stopped spinning,

36:08.967 --> 36:11.334
and at twice its normal speed,
since Ahmos died.

36:13.030 --> 36:16.173
You've come a long way
in a short time.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.876
You know, to be honest,

36:19.878 --> 36:21.545
I only half-believe it.

36:21.547 --> 36:24.147
I may be dreaming.

36:24.149 --> 36:27.050
Or pulling something
over on everyone.

36:28.050 --> 36:30.687
I don't think so.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.050
I think you're the real thing.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.963
(Dr. Samaha)<i> He's only been
 conscious</i>

36:39.965 --> 36:41.364
for an hour or so.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.200
But I can talk to him?

36:43.200 --> 36:45.202
Yeah.

36:51.076 --> 36:52.442
Father.

36:52.442 --> 36:54.012
(door closes)

36:54.012 --> 36:56.680
My true son.
(monitor beeping)

36:56.682 --> 37:00.717
The doctor said you want
to give me your kidney.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.719
You don't have to.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.588
I went for the tests.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.957
They took my blood
and everything.

37:08.894 --> 37:12.495
I wanted to be connected to you,

37:12.497 --> 37:14.830
like I must have been
when I was a little boy.

37:14.830 --> 37:17.360
- All little boys
- (Jamal breaths deeply)

37:17.360 --> 37:20.870
feel that way about
their fathers, don't they?

37:20.872 --> 37:23.700
I even went looking

37:23.700 --> 37:25.041
through old photo albums
 to see

37:25.043 --> 37:27.210
if I could find
evidence of that...

37:27.212 --> 37:30.080
of us...

37:30.082 --> 37:31.781
and look what I found.

37:34.186 --> 37:36.419
I recognized
the handwriting,

37:36.421 --> 37:38.650
but I couldn't
figure out what Nusrat's

37:38.650 --> 37:41.458
journal was doing with
our family memorabilia...

37:41.460 --> 37:43.293
until I started reading it.

37:44.730 --> 37:47.030
Uh, Nusrat

37:47.032 --> 37:50.233
had a difficult time
in our family.

37:50.235 --> 37:52.930
She became unstable.

37:52.930 --> 37:54.704
She was my wife.

37:54.706 --> 37:58.810
She hated me and
wanted to kill me.

37:58.810 --> 37:59.909
Because you violated her.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.990
You put your fingers

38:01.990 --> 38:04.581
inside of her the night
of our wedding.

38:04.583 --> 38:07.917
(monitor beeping faster)

38:07.919 --> 38:10.253
What I did...

38:10.255 --> 38:12.255
I did to protect you.

38:12.257 --> 38:16.660
A woman should be
faithful to her husband.

38:16.662 --> 38:20.590
I needed to make sure
she's faithful to you

38:20.590 --> 38:21.630
and to our family.

38:21.630 --> 38:22.265
Suddenly...

38:22.267 --> 38:25.268
everything made sense.

38:25.270 --> 38:27.470
Why for months
after we were married

38:27.470 --> 38:29.272
she wouldn't let me touch her.

38:29.274 --> 38:31.775
Why her father
turned against you.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.070
Why she hated you.

38:33.070 --> 38:35.178
Why she tried to kill you
and why she died.

38:35.180 --> 38:37.980
Would you listen to me...

38:37.980 --> 38:39.983
The thing I
couldn't figure out

38:39.985 --> 38:42.185
was why didn't you
just get rid of it.

38:42.187 --> 38:44.988
Why not burn it
and bury the ashes?

38:44.990 --> 38:47.690
At first I thought it was

38:47.690 --> 38:48.590
because you wanted
 to keep it,

38:48.590 --> 38:50.820
like some kind of sick souvenir
of my wedding night.

38:50.820 --> 38:53.863
But then, Father,

38:53.865 --> 38:57.500
then I realized the real
reason why you kept it.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.303
Because you wanted
someone to find it.

39:00.305 --> 39:02.372
Yes.
(fast beeping continues)

39:02.374 --> 39:04.874
You wanted me to find it.
(fast beeping continues)

39:04.876 --> 39:07.577
So I could finish what Nusrat
couldn't finish herself.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.514
Oh, my son.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.316
Ahmed.

39:13.318 --> 39:16.052
I love you.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.788
What are you doing?

39:32.738 --> 39:35.038
(Jamal groaning)

39:35.040 --> 39:38.108
(Ahmed grunting)

39:39.578 --> 39:41.644
(Jamal groaning)

39:44.640 --> 39:47.640
(monitor beeping decrease)

39:47.640 --> 39:50.640
(monitor beeps quietly)

39:53.358 --> 39:55.425
(flatline tone)

39:57.162 --> 39:59.229
(sighs)

40:00.699 --> 40:02.298
(sighs deeply)

40:23.288 --> 40:25.355
(flatline tone continues)

40:36.802 --> 40:38.334
(insistent knocking at door)

40:40.372 --> 40:42.772
(knocking continues)

40:49.581 --> 40:52.850
She came to see me,
I admit that, but I told her no.

40:52.850 --> 40:55.418
I don't know what
happened, Rashid, and...

40:55.420 --> 40:58.890
You honestly think I would be
so foolish to play both sides?

40:58.890 --> 41:01.290
You told her no,
and yet, the next day,

41:01.290 --> 41:02.892
Rashid calls her up
of his own accord.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.960
I can't explain that.

41:06.960 --> 41:07.597
I can.

41:07.599 --> 41:08.798
Either you're lying

41:08.800 --> 41:10.667
or there's a mole
in your mosque.

41:11.937 --> 41:13.536
Your brother-in-law, maybe?

41:14.439 --> 41:15.930
Wafiq?

41:15.930 --> 41:17.607
Someone knows
 what you're doing

41:17.609 --> 41:20.243
and I suggest you find out
before we do.

41:20.245 --> 41:21.945
It won't go well
for your mosque,

41:21.947 --> 41:24.447
if it turns out to be
a hideout for traitors.

41:24.449 --> 41:28.618
Now, we'll stay here,
as guests in your home,

41:28.620 --> 41:31.480
till I get word from the Palace
that the rescue attempt

41:31.480 --> 41:33.890
is beyond your ability
to interfere.

41:36.194 --> 41:38.528
(Maloof) We've been tracking
these vehicles

41:38.530 --> 41:40.296
for the past two hours.

41:40.298 --> 41:43.433
They are still 15 minutes
away from the border.

41:43.435 --> 41:45.635
And you're sure that Emma
is in one of these vehicles?

41:45.637 --> 41:49.472
Sure enough that I've deployed
my Special Forces Team

41:49.474 --> 41:51.474
- to Tal Areet.
- Tal Areet?

41:51.476 --> 41:53.710
It's a border town
the Caliphate's

41:53.710 --> 41:57.013
been using to traffic
oil and recruits.

41:57.015 --> 42:01.351
The only road to the exchange
point runs through Tal Areet.

42:04.823 --> 42:07.490
<i> We've inserted a dozen</i>
<i> Spec Ops soldiers around</i>

42:07.492 --> 42:09.559
<i> the intersection.</i>

42:10.562 --> 42:12.360
They'll create a traffic jam

42:12.360 --> 42:13.630
and make their move.

42:13.632 --> 42:16.830
In an urban area loyal
to the Caliphate.

42:16.830 --> 42:19.800
I know it sounds risky,
but it's the only place

42:19.800 --> 42:22.772
Ihab will be traveling slow enough
to extract your daughter.

42:31.380 --> 42:33.950
When you told me my mother
loves me more than my father,

42:33.950 --> 42:35.018
what did you mean?

42:35.020 --> 42:36.880
No talking.

42:36.880 --> 42:39.055
At least tell me what we're
doing, where we're going.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.323
We're almost there.

42:40.325 --> 42:41.324
Where?

42:41.326 --> 42:43.593
I said no talking.

42:49.601 --> 42:51.601
(Siddiq) I have to take
 a piss.

42:53.004 --> 42:54.470
Keep an eye on them.

43:13.625 --> 43:16.993
So, you told your brother,
didn't you?

43:21.433 --> 43:22.899
It was her wish.

43:22.901 --> 43:24.968
I only did what
she asked us to do.

43:24.970 --> 43:27.003
(sighs)

43:28.206 --> 43:30.807
What are you going to do,
kill me?

43:30.809 --> 43:33.276
Maybe you want to turn me in.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.580
Give up your wife
and your brother-in-law

43:35.580 --> 43:37.747
to be tortured by
the secret police.

43:37.749 --> 43:40.416
Of course, 
what does that prove?

43:40.418 --> 43:43.486
Except that you're in the pocket
of the Al Fayeeds?

43:43.488 --> 43:46.290
May God Almighty 
forgive us all.

43:46.290 --> 43:47.520
My brother

43:47.520 --> 43:48.791
paid for that mosque of yours

43:48.793 --> 43:50.226
for my sake.

43:50.228 --> 43:53.162
He elevated you like
the Borgias made popes.

43:54.899 --> 43:57.433
Do you really think you can
survive in this community

43:57.435 --> 43:59.335
if you turn against him?

44:01.006 --> 44:03.373
Let's just pray
nobody gets killed.

44:04.476 --> 44:06.075
May God Almighty
forgive us all.

44:07.112 --> 44:09.746
May God Almighty
forgive us all.

44:15.020 --> 44:17.520
Target vehicles
approaching your position.

44:17.522 --> 44:19.088
Standing by.

44:21.593 --> 44:23.626
I've got visual contact.

44:23.628 --> 44:25.795
Move on target
at your discretion.

44:25.795 --> 44:28.790
(radio signal crackles)

44:29.534 --> 44:31.601
Now.

44:34.205 --> 44:37.173
(Team Leader) All teams prepare
to go on my signal.

44:37.173 --> 44:40.170
(people chatting indistinctly)

44:44.282 --> 44:47.280
(car horns honking)

44:47.280 --> 44:50.355
(driver shouts in Arabic)

44:50.355 --> 44:52.555
(horns honking)
(people shouting)

44:52.557 --> 44:55.224
(driver honking horn)

45:00.498 --> 45:01.664
Go. Go, go, go!

45:01.666 --> 45:03.633
Get out of here!

45:03.635 --> 45:04.667
(gunfire)

45:04.669 --> 45:07.170
(people screaming)

45:07.172 --> 45:08.371
(gunfire)

45:15.180 --> 45:17.180
(gunfire, shouting over speakers)

45:17.182 --> 45:18.915
(Emma gasping)

45:21.653 --> 45:24.053
(gasps, whimpers)

45:29.227 --> 45:31.427
(cries)

45:31.429 --> 45:34.190
Open the door and
show me your hands!

45:40.000 --> 45:42.572
(metal creaking)

45:43.708 --> 45:45.775
Okay, okay, okay.

45:50.248 --> 45:51.447
(grunts)

45:51.449 --> 45:54.817
(mob yelling)

45:56.810 --> 45:59.810
(fighting grunts and gasps)

46:00.759 --> 46:03.426
(gunfire)

46:03.428 --> 46:05.294
No.

46:05.296 --> 46:07.430
Shit.

46:07.432 --> 46:09.499
(mob yelling)

46:10.902 --> 46:12.301
(man screaming over speaker)

46:12.303 --> 46:13.803
No.

46:19.444 --> 46:22.945
(Maloof) Turn off the infrared.

46:22.947 --> 46:24.514
No.

46:27.418 --> 46:29.852
Your mother and father
just killed you.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.524
(mob yelling)

46:37.829 --> 46:39.420
Get out of the car.

46:42.500 --> 46:43.766
(Maloof) Position directly
 above him.

46:43.768 --> 46:45.401
Zoom in.

46:45.403 --> 46:47.170
No, no... no.

46:47.172 --> 46:49.940
- (sobs) No, no, no, no.
- Do something.

46:49.940 --> 46:52.241
Let me talk to Ihab!

46:52.243 --> 46:53.470
Let me give myself up to him.

46:53.470 --> 46:55.311
- Let me give myself up to him!
- Molly, Molly, Molly.

46:55.313 --> 46:56.679
Barry, let me talk to him.

46:56.681 --> 46:59.448
(whimpering softly)

46:59.450 --> 47:00.616
Oh, God.

47:00.618 --> 47:02.318
(phone rings)

47:02.320 --> 47:03.386
- (Molly) Baby.
- It's Ihab.

47:08.426 --> 47:09.559
Ihab.

47:12.931 --> 47:15.530
You Americans are so arrogant,
playing God,

47:15.530 --> 47:17.800
but there is no God 
but God.

47:17.802 --> 47:20.369
Please, listen to me...

47:20.371 --> 47:22.505
You just made the second mistake
with me you're going to regret

47:22.507 --> 47:24.273
for the rest of your life,
Bassam.

47:24.275 --> 47:26.410
- Emma!
- Listen to me, please.

47:26.410 --> 47:29.378
Emma, I'm gonna get
you out of there.

47:29.380 --> 47:30.646
She can't hear you.

47:30.648 --> 47:32.849
Daddy! (sobs)

47:32.851 --> 47:35.551
(Emma sobbing over phone)

47:35.553 --> 47:37.954
Please.

47:37.956 --> 47:40.957
Let's... just negotiate,
you and me.

47:40.959 --> 47:42.490
Why...

47:42.490 --> 47:44.820
should I negotiate
with you, Bassam?

47:44.820 --> 47:46.662
You just fucked me.

47:46.664 --> 47:47.730
(Emma crying)

47:47.732 --> 47:48.831
I know.

47:48.833 --> 47:50.700
I know and I'm sorry.

47:50.702 --> 47:52.235
I'm sorry, I was, uh...

47:52.237 --> 47:53.636
that was stupid.

47:53.638 --> 47:55.400
But I was, I was crazy.

47:55.400 --> 47:57.206
I'm... I'm her father.

47:57.208 --> 47:59.640
I'm done here.

47:59.640 --> 48:00.370
No, no, no, no!

48:00.370 --> 48:01.611
Wait, wait, wait, Ihab.

48:03.047 --> 48:07.080
If you kill her, you get...
you get nothing.

48:07.080 --> 48:08.150
You end up with nothing.

48:08.150 --> 48:09.320
Ask me for something.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.220
- Anything. I'll give it to you.
- (Emma crying)

48:11.222 --> 48:12.855
Step down.

48:12.857 --> 48:15.690
Step down,
make me President of Abuddin,

48:15.690 --> 48:16.860
like I should have been.

48:16.860 --> 48:18.761
- (crying) Just do it, just do whatever it takes.
- I can't.

48:18.763 --> 48:20.563
- You know that. I can't do that.
- Just do what he says.

48:20.565 --> 48:22.031
- Please, ask me for something I can give you.
- Just do it!

48:22.033 --> 48:23.165
What do you want?!

48:23.167 --> 48:25.830
I want you to live in agony

48:25.830 --> 48:26.669
for the rest of your life,

48:26.660 --> 48:28.770
like I will live in agony
for the rest of mine.

48:28.770 --> 48:31.607
I want the Al Fayeeds
to pay the price

48:31.609 --> 48:34.510
for once, instead of me,

48:34.512 --> 48:36.946
instead of the innocent
people that I love.

48:38.950 --> 48:41.384
That's all I want.

48:41.386 --> 48:43.519
No, Mommy!

48:43.521 --> 48:45.688
Mommy!

48:45.690 --> 48:47.089
Mommy!

48:48.426 --> 48:50.026
(blade slices, Emma groans)
(mob cheers)

48:50.028 --> 48:52.929
No! No!

48:52.931 --> 48:54.997
(mob cheering over speakers)

49:01.406 --> 49:03.472
(mob cheering)

49:09.147 --> 49:11.410
(Molly) No!

49:14.152 --> 49:16.218
(sobbing)

49:18.056 --> 49:20.957
No!

49:22.160 --> 49:23.659
No!

49:25.396 --> 49:27.830
No!
