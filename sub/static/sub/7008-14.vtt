00:03.050 --> 00:05.019
<i>Does everybody know what time it is?</i>

00:05.119 --> 00:06.178
<i>- Tool Time!
- Tool Time!</i>

00:06.254 --> 00:07.278
That's right.

00:07.355 --> 00:08.459
Binford Tools is proud to present

00:08.489 --> 00:11.755
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

00:17.098 --> 00:20.330
Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

00:20.935 --> 00:22.206
Thank you, Heidi.
Welcome to <i>Tool Time.</i>

00:22.236 --> 00:25.070
I am Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.
And I intend to remain him.

00:27.241 --> 00:29.574
And you all know my assistant,
Al Borland.

00:31.746 --> 00:34.045
Thank you.

00:34.949 --> 00:37.714
I'm excited. Today we have
a globally significant <i>Tool Time.</i>

00:37.818 --> 00:40.151
We're doing our <i>Tool Time</i> salute

00:44.058 --> 00:46.498
- to international relations.
- to international relations.

00:47.428 --> 00:50.523
In today's world,
manufacturing superpowers compete

00:50.598 --> 00:52.965
for the leading edge
in consumer products.

00:53.034 --> 00:54.696
Competition is healthy but

00:54.769 --> 00:57.534
so much more can be accomplished
if you work together...

00:57.638 --> 00:58.697
- Al?
- harmoniously.

00:58.773 --> 01:02.141
Al! My show, okay?

01:02.243 --> 01:05.111
So in the spirit of international
brotherhood, we have invited

01:05.179 --> 01:07.618
the president of a major
Japanese corporation to be our guest,

01:07.648 --> 01:09.617
to show us
some of their newest inventions.

01:09.684 --> 01:14.315
Let's give a warm <i>Tool Time</i> welcome
to Nobo Nakamura.

01:20.461 --> 01:24.125
Welcome to <i>Tool Time.</i>
Or as they say in Japanese...

01:26.968 --> 01:30.735
You just invited me
to frolic in your trousers.

01:33.808 --> 01:37.108
Well, in this light
you're kind of an attractive man.

01:37.178 --> 01:42.242
All right, Nobo. Why don't you show us
what's new in Japanese high tech?

01:42.316 --> 01:45.445
I would be happy to, Al.

01:45.519 --> 01:47.351
Behold

01:47.421 --> 01:49.322
the future!

01:53.160 --> 01:57.256
Well, it appears to be a steel rod
with a hand on it.

01:57.331 --> 01:58.765
It's called The Lazy Grabber.

01:58.833 --> 02:02.793
You can pick up stuff
without having to leave your chair.

02:04.972 --> 02:07.044
Well, I was under the impression
that Nakamura Industries

02:07.074 --> 02:09.543
was involved in lasers
and high-tech stuff like that.

02:09.610 --> 02:13.479
Someone on your staff
called Nakamura Novelties.

02:20.721 --> 02:24.214
We specialize in things like

02:24.291 --> 02:26.658
the Noodle Guard.

02:28.462 --> 02:32.490
Protection from embarrassing
noodle backsplash.

02:36.871 --> 02:41.502
Well, that's bound to turn that
Japanese economy right around, huh?

02:41.575 --> 02:45.273
Now I'll show you something
really state of the art.

02:45.346 --> 02:47.906
I will demonstrate on Al.

02:52.019 --> 02:55.979
This is the all-day tissue dispenser.

03:00.361 --> 03:04.731
For the guy on the go who has to go.

03:06.067 --> 03:09.765
That's just a crappy invention.

03:09.837 --> 03:12.568
You calling my
number-one seller crappy?

03:12.640 --> 03:15.542
Wouldn't that be
your number-two seller?

03:17.645 --> 03:19.978
Nobo is not laughing.

03:20.047 --> 03:23.211
Oh, boy, Nobo. I'll bite.
What the heck is this?

03:23.317 --> 03:25.877
This is called the Grin Grabber.

03:25.953 --> 03:28.320
Simply put on your face like this

03:28.422 --> 03:31.153
and then with one tug of the string,

03:31.225 --> 03:35.526
even grouchiest guy
turns into Happy Harry.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:47.108 --> 03:49.668
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever seen.

03:49.777 --> 03:51.268
Okay, now you make Nobo mad.

03:51.345 --> 03:54.008
And yet you're smiling.

04:46.167 --> 04:48.727
Hey, Tim, so your family is going away
this weekend?

04:48.836 --> 04:49.907
- Yeah.
- You want to hang out?

04:49.937 --> 04:52.497
- Nope.
- Okay, then. Nice talking to you.

04:52.606 --> 04:54.575
Al, it has nothing to do with you.

04:54.642 --> 04:57.202
Just being alone this weekend
will give me the perfect chance

04:57.278 --> 05:00.442
- to write that book for Binford.
- You're still writing that thing?

05:00.514 --> 05:03.006
Didn't they give you the advance,
like, six months ago?

05:03.083 --> 05:05.518
Yes. And I spent the advance
six months ago.

05:05.586 --> 05:08.454
And I just, you know,
have to write the book.

05:08.522 --> 05:10.661
- You've done nothing?
- Yes! I've done a lot of things.

05:10.691 --> 05:12.930
You plan. There's planning involved.
You don't just write a book.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.266
You gotta plan. Make plans.
I made a lot of plans, you know?

05:15.296 --> 05:17.968
Like you gotta plan who you'd want
to do it if they made a movie out of it.

05:17.998 --> 05:21.435
Okay, let me guess. Harrison Ford?

05:21.502 --> 05:25.564
He knows his tools,
but doesn't have my bone structure.

05:25.639 --> 05:28.006
- So what's the deadline?
- Monday morning.

05:28.108 --> 05:30.348
I have to have three chapters.
Which gives me, of course,

05:30.411 --> 05:34.746
the entire weekend to crystallize
my thoughts on love, life,

05:34.815 --> 05:39.253
tools, my fascination with them,
yin-yang, the dharma of guyness.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.791
You have no idea what to write,
do you?

05:40.821 --> 05:43.450
I have no idea what to write!

05:43.524 --> 05:44.617
Good luck.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.455
- Bye, Dad. See you Monday.
- You guys have a nice weekend.

05:49.530 --> 05:52.295
I'll be fine. There's plenty of food
in the refrigerator.

05:52.366 --> 05:54.232
I need it nice and quiet
to get my work done.

05:54.301 --> 05:56.566
- Bye, Tim!
- Yeah. Okay. I'll miss you all.

05:56.637 --> 05:58.003
- See you.
- I'll miss you a lot!

05:58.072 --> 05:59.540
- Miss you, too.
- Miss you.

05:59.607 --> 06:00.973
Bye.

06:03.777 --> 06:06.212
I'm all by myself!

06:06.280 --> 06:08.511
Miss you!

06:08.582 --> 06:10.744
I can do whatever I want!
Anything I want to do.

06:10.851 --> 06:13.090
What do we want to do? Let's think.
What do we want to do?

06:13.120 --> 06:15.351
- First...
<i>- Take a nap.</i>

06:15.422 --> 06:17.982
<i>Then go to a strip club or a drag race.</i>

06:18.092 --> 06:20.960
<i>Have a snack!
Then I'll nap in the chair or the couch.</i>

06:21.028 --> 06:23.759
<i>Chair or couch? Couch!</i>

06:23.831 --> 06:25.959
Yes!

06:26.033 --> 06:27.296
No.

06:27.368 --> 06:30.497
Gotta write.
Write, write, write, write, write.

06:32.273 --> 06:35.835
Well, I'll just get started. Okay, okay.
All right.

06:38.279 --> 06:40.339
<i>4:00. I'll write for four hours straight.</i>

06:40.414 --> 06:41.848
<i>Figure 30 pages per hour,</i>

06:41.916 --> 06:44.784
<i>by 8:00, I'm up to 120.</i>

06:45.486 --> 06:46.784
Then I get to eat.

06:46.854 --> 06:49.289
<i>I'm actually ahead of schedule.</i>

06:49.356 --> 06:51.222
So let's eat.

06:53.394 --> 06:56.364
Look at all the food Jill made me.

06:56.463 --> 07:00.400
Macaroni and cheese, pot roast.
Oh, boy!

07:00.467 --> 07:02.493
Tuna casserole.

07:02.570 --> 07:04.334
So nice of her.

07:04.438 --> 07:07.067
Yes. I'd like to order a pizza.

07:07.141 --> 07:11.374
Let's get a large with onions
and double sausage.

07:11.445 --> 07:13.384
<i>- That's a little fatty.</i>
- You have turkey sausage?

07:13.414 --> 07:15.719
<i>- What are you? A hairdresser?</i>
- How about just vegetables?

07:15.749 --> 07:17.513
<i>You can't stand vegetables.</i>

07:17.585 --> 07:19.679
Put double cheese on it.

07:19.753 --> 07:22.814
Yeah. Tim Taylor.
You got my address?

07:22.890 --> 07:26.850
Yes. I rewired the doorbell. Thank you.

07:26.927 --> 07:30.455
<i>What a wuss!
It was only a second-degree burn.</i>

07:32.666 --> 07:34.430
All right.

07:37.037 --> 07:39.404
Okay, all right. Here we go.

07:41.976 --> 07:43.672
"A."

07:44.611 --> 07:45.977
"A."

07:49.516 --> 07:51.417
"B."

07:51.485 --> 07:52.976
"C."

07:53.053 --> 07:54.112
"B."

07:54.188 --> 07:55.679
"C."

07:55.756 --> 07:57.122
"A."

07:57.191 --> 08:00.252
"O." "O." "O."

08:03.831 --> 08:05.595
"R."

08:06.266 --> 08:07.266
"A."

08:07.768 --> 08:08.768
"C."

08:18.145 --> 08:20.671
Right when I was getting hot!

08:23.484 --> 08:25.214
Hello?

08:25.285 --> 08:26.651
What?

08:26.720 --> 08:28.586
Hi, Mary Lou.

08:28.655 --> 08:31.090
Am I satisfied
with my long-distance carrier?

08:31.158 --> 08:34.219
<i>- Tim.</i>
- Suppose.

08:34.294 --> 08:35.818
- Yes. What?
<i>- Hello?</i>

08:35.895 --> 08:37.023
No. Ma'am?

08:37.097 --> 08:38.793
<i>- Hey, bonehead!</i>
- Wait. Hold it.

08:38.866 --> 08:41.392
This is really a bad time for me.

08:45.806 --> 08:49.038
Okay, Mary Lou,
let me get this straight.

08:49.109 --> 08:51.669
In order to get the mid-week discount

08:51.779 --> 08:53.748
of four cents a minute...

08:56.016 --> 08:58.986
Yeah. Look, I have to call

08:59.053 --> 09:02.922
1,700 times between Saturday

09:02.990 --> 09:06.017
and that following Thursday after 6:00.

09:07.328 --> 09:09.695
Just sign me up!

09:10.931 --> 09:13.059
No more phone calls.

09:13.133 --> 09:15.439
<i>Well, that worked out well, Tim.
Hour and a half on the phone,</i>

09:15.469 --> 09:17.938
<i>you saved 26 cents.</i>

09:19.907 --> 09:23.605
<i>Nice chatting with you, too,
Cyber Fred.</i>

09:26.980 --> 09:32.248
<i>No! You prove
that I'm not Marlon Brando, pal!</i>

09:32.319 --> 09:35.187
<i>Cyberspace e-mail! Look at the time!</i>

09:35.255 --> 09:37.815
<i>The greatest writers of all time
never had a computer.</i>

09:37.925 --> 09:40.952
<i>They used stone tablets and chisels,</i>

09:41.028 --> 09:43.327
<i>bark, Latin.</i>

09:43.397 --> 09:45.263
<i>The password is...</i>

09:45.332 --> 09:48.461
Legal pad.

09:48.535 --> 09:51.095
Paper, pencils.

09:53.707 --> 09:56.472
<i>What makes legal pads legal?</i>

09:58.278 --> 10:01.180
<i>Is there such a thing as an illegal pad?</i>

10:02.349 --> 10:04.909
<i>What's legal about yellow?</i>

10:04.985 --> 10:08.649
<i>Pencils are yellow. It's wood.</i>

10:08.722 --> 10:10.691
<i>That's a nice pencil.</i>

10:10.791 --> 10:12.885
Okay. Pencil.

10:12.960 --> 10:16.089
Check. Eraser. Go. Lead. Go.

10:16.163 --> 10:20.726
All systems go, we have

10:20.801 --> 10:22.326
liftoff.

10:33.981 --> 10:37.645
<i>Throughout history, man has...</i>

10:45.859 --> 10:47.691
<i>Here we go.</i>

10:47.761 --> 10:49.821
<i>A little hair.</i>

10:49.897 --> 10:52.366
<i>Very good. Now, see,
if this thing was a comic book,</i>

10:52.432 --> 10:55.334
<i>I'd have one page done already.</i>

11:02.576 --> 11:05.842
<i>Boy. That writer's cramp is kicking in.</i>

11:07.114 --> 11:09.276
<i>You know,
I'm more of a verbal guy, anyway.</i>

11:09.383 --> 11:11.388
<i>Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
I'll dictate my thoughts</i>

11:11.418 --> 11:13.683
<i>into a tape recorder,
then play them back later</i>

11:13.754 --> 11:16.724
<i>and organize them.</i>

11:16.823 --> 11:19.850
Captain's log, 2024.

11:22.396 --> 11:24.024
Spock, was that you?

11:24.097 --> 11:25.998
I'm not buying this stuff
that Vulcans can't.

11:26.066 --> 11:28.228
There's only two of us in here.

11:28.302 --> 11:31.272
Believe me, that wasn't human.

11:36.076 --> 11:38.045
<i>Men have different energy
than women.</i>

11:38.145 --> 11:40.512
Men have different energy than women.

11:40.614 --> 11:42.139
<i>We're take charge.</i>

11:42.216 --> 11:43.844
We take charge.

11:43.917 --> 11:46.079
<i>- We're go-getters.</i>
- Go-getters!

11:46.153 --> 11:48.384
<i>This is ridiculous.
I can't write on the couch.</i>

11:48.455 --> 11:50.890
<i>I gotta go to a place
that pumps me up.</i>

11:50.958 --> 11:52.517
- Outside?
<i>- Upstairs.</i>

11:52.826 --> 11:54.988
Kitchen, no.

11:55.062 --> 11:57.088
<i>The garage! Bingo-bango-bongo!</i>

11:59.099 --> 12:02.263
<i>But, first, I'll enjoy a little pizza.</i>

12:03.870 --> 12:05.771
Sorry I'm late. My car broke down.

12:06.940 --> 12:10.206
- Is that a GTO?
- Yeah. I restore old Goats.

12:10.277 --> 12:11.643
Car guy.

12:11.712 --> 12:15.240
I'm building a hot rod in the garage.
A '46 Ford convertible.

12:15.315 --> 12:19.582
- You got time to show it to me?
- Do I have time?

12:28.028 --> 12:31.192
So I'm gonna powder coat the headers
one more time to make sure that...

12:31.298 --> 12:33.233
- Yeah, yeah, that's what you said.
- Yeah.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.305
- The top is all... The whole thing was...
- I know.

12:35.335 --> 12:36.997
- The German canvas.
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:37.070 --> 12:39.198
- I should really go.
- Hey!

12:39.273 --> 12:41.435
I spent this whole time
talking about the hot rod.

12:41.541 --> 12:45.103
What do I know about you? I mean,
what's new in the pizza business?

12:45.212 --> 12:50.173
Well, we're thinking about
branching into thick crust.

12:51.551 --> 12:53.590
Yeah. Well, you're gonna have to get
bigger thermal bags.

12:53.620 --> 12:56.385
Yeah. We kind of thought of that.

12:57.691 --> 13:00.126
Well, you know,
I should get back to writing, I guess.

13:00.193 --> 13:02.032
Unless you need someone
to go on a delivery with you.

13:02.062 --> 13:04.088
Oh, no. I'll be all right.

13:06.833 --> 13:11.669
<i>There you go. Three pounds of cheese
and a forty-year-old colon. Perfect.</i>

13:22.449 --> 13:24.111
Well, that worked.

13:32.526 --> 13:34.995
<i>In an amazing development,
Tim Taylor's book</i>

13:35.062 --> 13:36.621
<i>has sold 12 million copies</i>

13:36.730 --> 13:38.699
<i>before even hitting the shelves.</i>

13:38.966 --> 13:42.528
Now on tomorrow's show,
the man who wrote <i>Man</i>

13:42.602 --> 13:45.071
is going to teach us
what it means to be a man,

13:45.138 --> 13:48.267
and also make us better women for it.

13:48.342 --> 13:50.971
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.
That's tomorrow.

13:54.114 --> 13:57.448
Folks, I want to apologize.
Instead of getting a literary genius

13:57.517 --> 13:59.679
like Tim Taylor,
we're stuck tonight with

13:59.753 --> 14:01.779
Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando.

14:03.090 --> 14:06.185
Next week, Pulitzer Prize-winning
author Toni Morrison is here,

14:06.259 --> 14:10.162
not to read from her latest book, but
from the much anticipated bestseller

14:10.230 --> 14:11.323
by Tim Taylor.

14:11.398 --> 14:13.270
<i>This makes it the best-selling
volume in the world,</i>

14:13.300 --> 14:15.599
<i>second only to the Bible.</i>

14:15.669 --> 14:20.004
Mrs. Taylor, can you tell us anything
about your husband's book?

14:20.073 --> 14:24.340
I'm sure that it's gonna be
a brilliant study of the male psyche.

14:24.411 --> 14:27.904
Tim is truly a visionary.

14:27.981 --> 14:30.143
And he's great in bed.

14:31.651 --> 14:33.957
I think it's great that my dad
has written this important book.

14:33.987 --> 14:37.151
And by the way, ladies,

14:37.257 --> 14:40.421
I definitely have
some of that greatness in my genes.

14:42.562 --> 14:46.727
Dad wrote a book?
I'll believe it when I see it.

14:47.634 --> 14:50.536
Tim, Tim,
you must be so excited tonight.

14:50.604 --> 14:53.130
Hey, you're Kenny the pizza guy.

14:53.206 --> 14:57.735
Not anymore.
Now I'm Kenny the on-air personality.

14:57.811 --> 15:00.246
So you won't be needing
a tip then, huh?

15:01.882 --> 15:04.374
Well, Tim, for selling so many copies,

15:04.451 --> 15:08.149
the publisher has two big surprises
for you.

15:10.690 --> 15:12.989
- I like them.
- A check for 10 million dollars

15:13.060 --> 15:15.291
and the keys to a brand new Ferrari.

15:15.362 --> 15:18.093
- You're kidding!
<i>- Not so fast.</i>

15:18.165 --> 15:20.303
Before we let you drive away,
you're gonna have to read us

15:20.333 --> 15:22.700
a few passages
from your highly anticipated book.

15:22.769 --> 15:25.466
Well, I'd love to, Kenny.

15:25.539 --> 15:29.101
Plenty of places for autographs here.
And notes, you know, personal notes,

15:29.176 --> 15:31.145
little letters
you want to write to yourself.

15:31.244 --> 15:34.737
- Oh, no!
<i>- There's nothing in this book!</i>

15:34.815 --> 15:36.977
<i>Nothing!</i>

15:37.084 --> 15:38.211
What a hack!

15:38.285 --> 15:40.914
Who are we kidding?
This man's a loser.

15:40.987 --> 15:45.652
Tomorrow's show, celebrities
who feel betrayed by Tim Taylor.

16:01.107 --> 16:04.942
Coffee. Joe. Java. And lots of it.

16:09.082 --> 16:11.521
Hey, Wilson. You're up late. What are
you doing on the old Studebaker?

16:11.551 --> 16:13.223
Changing the oil?
Flushing the radiator? What?

16:13.253 --> 16:16.314
I'm just changing my oil.
Then I'm gonna wash my windshields.

16:16.389 --> 16:18.269
All right! What do you say
we pop in a new motor

16:18.325 --> 16:20.453
and rebuild the transmission?

16:20.527 --> 16:23.224
- Gum?
- Well, no, thank you.

16:23.296 --> 16:26.733
My goodness, you're awfully peppy
for this time of night.

16:26.800 --> 16:27.893
Peppy, peppy, peppy.

16:27.968 --> 16:30.568
Do you think peppy's just a male trait?
Or is it a universal trait

16:30.604 --> 16:33.768
for all people, all times, huh?
Want some gum?

16:33.874 --> 16:35.843
No, thank you, Tim.
And if I might suggest it,

16:35.909 --> 16:37.775
you seem to be three sticks to the wind.

16:37.844 --> 16:40.817
No. No sticks. No wind. No nothing.
I've just been drinking a lot of coffee.

16:40.847 --> 16:42.452
Lot of coffee. A lot of caffeine.
Lot of coffee.

16:42.482 --> 16:45.021
See, I just got about 36 hours
to finish three chapters of my book.

16:45.051 --> 16:47.350
- Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim, take a breath.
- Let me finish.

16:49.623 --> 16:51.785
Now, how much writing have you
actually gotten done?

16:51.858 --> 16:52.858
Well...

16:52.926 --> 16:54.292
A paragraph.

16:54.394 --> 16:57.922
- I hope it's a good paragraph.
- Stinks.

16:57.998 --> 17:00.058
Maybe you're being too critical
of your work.

17:00.133 --> 17:03.069
No. Even the pizza guy hated it.

17:03.136 --> 17:04.875
What's the matter with me?
I got a lot of good ideas

17:04.905 --> 17:06.635
up here in the old nugget.

17:06.705 --> 17:08.612
Just can't seem to get them
to come down my neck,

17:08.642 --> 17:11.373
over the shoulder,
through the arm and into the hand.

17:11.444 --> 17:12.776
The hand...

17:12.846 --> 17:14.406
You know, it's odd
there's so much space

17:14.513 --> 17:15.785
between your index finger
and your thumb.

17:15.815 --> 17:18.683
There could be a lot more fingers
right in there.

17:18.752 --> 17:22.519
Well, Tim, it sounds to me like you've
got a classic case of a writer's block.

17:22.589 --> 17:24.819
What exactly are you trying
to write about?

17:24.891 --> 17:27.952
Men. Who they are.
What makes them tick.

17:28.028 --> 17:30.862
- First I wrote that all men are predators.
- Well, that's a start.

17:30.931 --> 17:33.203
Yes, yes. It's a start.
But then I thought about Al's family.

17:33.233 --> 17:35.361
And the only predator there is his mom.

17:35.435 --> 17:38.769
Then I wrote that all men are consumed
with speed and power.

17:38.838 --> 17:42.502
Then I thought about you.
You still use a manual lawnmower.

17:42.576 --> 17:45.136
Then I spent the rest of the night
just making crank phone calls.

17:45.212 --> 17:47.704
You know? Hey, ever taken a bus?

17:47.781 --> 17:51.047
Well, you better give it back!

17:51.117 --> 17:54.212
You know, Tim, I'm reminded of
the playwright George Bernard Shaw.

17:54.287 --> 17:56.916
He said, "The man who writes about
himself in his own time

17:56.990 --> 18:01.928
"is the only man who writes
about all people and about all time."

18:04.864 --> 18:06.958
Nice car.

18:07.033 --> 18:08.558
What were you just saying?

18:08.635 --> 18:10.570
Well, I'm just saying
that it's a daunting task

18:10.637 --> 18:13.869
to write about all men, because
no two men are exactly the same.

18:13.940 --> 18:17.206
You might be more successful
writing about one man.

18:17.277 --> 18:20.611
Like that famous guy Seymour Butts!

18:20.680 --> 18:24.344
- Why do I even try?
- I know what you're saying.

18:25.151 --> 18:27.211
I should just write about me,
Tim "The Tool Man."

18:27.287 --> 18:29.222
Exactly.

18:29.289 --> 18:31.656
I'll give that a shot.

18:32.058 --> 18:34.755
- Sure you don't want some gum?
- No.

18:34.828 --> 18:36.490
It's interesting, though, gum.

18:36.563 --> 18:40.227
The origin of the word "gum."
Think about it. Think about it.

18:41.167 --> 18:42.328
Gumby,

18:44.004 --> 18:46.371
who's made of clay, huh?

18:46.473 --> 18:49.932
- They didn't call him Clayby, did they?
- Go!

18:53.313 --> 18:55.873
<i>Who wants to
write about feelings?</i>

18:55.949 --> 18:58.919
<i>Well, maybe other guys feel
the same way.</i>

18:58.985 --> 19:01.614
<i>I wonder how they feel about feelings.</i>

19:03.056 --> 19:05.582
<i>One chapter done.</i>

19:16.069 --> 19:19.164
<i>I really gotta get that clock fixed.</i>

19:23.576 --> 19:26.478
<i>Nothing's going to keep me
from finishing this book.</i>

19:26.546 --> 19:29.482
<i>Except maybe
those 12 cups of coffee I drank.</i>

19:29.549 --> 19:33.316
<i>No, that's an excuse, Tim.
I've gotta keep writing.</i>

19:37.791 --> 19:40.124
<i>I have to finish this book
so others have something to read</i>

19:40.193 --> 19:43.322
<i>in the bathroom,
which leads me to Chapter 3.</i>

19:43.396 --> 19:47.333
<i>"Men Who Read in the Bathroom
and the Women Who Need to Vent."</i>

19:54.407 --> 19:58.674
<i>Three chapters done.
Seven minutes ahead of schedule.</i>

19:58.745 --> 20:01.579
<i>Well, maybe it's time
for one more chapter.</i>

20:02.982 --> 20:03.982
<i>No.</i>

20:05.185 --> 20:08.815
<i>Well, maybe I'll just
knock out the dedication.</i>

20:10.457 --> 20:11.618
<i>All right.</i>

20:11.725 --> 20:15.059
<i>This book is about men. It's for men.</i>

20:15.128 --> 20:18.394
<i>And it's dedicated to me.</i>

20:32.011 --> 20:35.948
- "Men, the Prologue."
- It gets better.

20:36.016 --> 20:38.247
"Beginning this book
wasn't an easy task.

20:38.318 --> 20:42.050
"But through my struggles I learned
that a man should trust his instincts.

20:42.121 --> 20:45.614
"He should face his fears
instead of avoiding them."

20:46.860 --> 20:48.692
Keep reading. Come on.

20:48.762 --> 20:51.732
"Men shouldn't be afraid to talk
to other men about their feelings

20:51.798 --> 20:54.563
"as long as it's in the garage."

20:54.634 --> 20:56.796
"See photos on page eight, 15
and back flap."

20:56.903 --> 20:59.065
All right, forget that.
Move on to Chapter 2.

20:59.139 --> 21:00.698
Okay.

21:02.475 --> 21:05.240
"Nothing makes you feel
more like a man than being a father.

21:05.345 --> 21:09.214
"And nothing makes a man
more scared than being a father.

21:09.282 --> 21:11.410
"That's where the challenge is."

21:12.852 --> 21:15.117
That's pretty good, Dad.

21:15.188 --> 21:17.157
Can't wait to finish it.

21:17.223 --> 21:20.489
That's because men are impatient.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.530
So are you gonna analyze
everything I say from now on?

21:23.596 --> 21:28.125
There's an example of a man
becoming defensive.

21:28.201 --> 21:31.865
And here's an example of a man
avoiding confrontation.

21:31.938 --> 21:36.308
- Dad, why are you following me?
- Well, 'cause some men are followers.

21:40.780 --> 21:44.683
We have a globally significant
<i>Tool Time</i> today.

21:45.752 --> 21:47.721
I don't know.

21:53.860 --> 21:57.695
I don't think so. Pizza boy hated it, too.

21:57.864 --> 22:00.629
I got a lot of good ideas in my head.
I just can't...
