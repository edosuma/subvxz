{\pos(192,230)}The treatment that almost killed Wes,
it's working.

00:03.292 --> 00:04.745
{\pos(192,230)}I knew you could do it.

00:04.865 --> 00:07.731
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
is a well-established medical treatment.

00:07.851 --> 00:11.440
There's evidence that it can help
with intracranial abscess,

00:11.560 --> 00:13.224
an increase of pus in the brain.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.198
- That's what you've got?
- I think so.

00:16.723 --> 00:17.521
Bob,

00:18.285 --> 00:19.940
{\I'm }sorry about what happened {\up }on the roof.

00:20.311 --> 00:21.775
Get better, Wes, okay?

00:22.620 --> 00:23.956
What's in Sweden?

00:24.347 --> 00:27.280
They're using RNAi
to stop the hep-C virus.

00:27.789 --> 00:29.115
Can I get into those trials?

00:29.511 --> 00:30.483
You're in!

00:30.777 --> 00:32.861
Well, I'm on my bike
like five nights a week,

00:32.981 --> 00:35.871
I thought it might be fun
to go for a ride after work

00:36.032 --> 00:37.163
together some time.

00:37.283 --> 00:39.404
I hear you're off to Sweden, great.

00:39.524 --> 00:41.503
Everywhere you look,
you can think of me.

00:42.424 --> 00:43.591
Here you go.

00:45.126 --> 00:46.424
You're not quitting, Wes.

00:46.744 --> 00:48.885
- Yes I am.
- You'll be back.

{\pos(192,230)}What do you mean
they haven't stopped the race?

02:03.484 --> 02:04.762
No, listen,

02:04.882 --> 02:07.036
over two dozen people
with lung infections

02:07.156 --> 02:08.794
is not an isolated incident.

02:08.913 --> 02:10.675
That is what we call an outbreak.

02:12.419 --> 02:14.721
I don't give a shit about your sponsors.

02:15.961 --> 02:17.196
Alright, listen to me.

02:17.316 --> 02:20.225
The Tour Cyclo Quebec is over.

02:21.225 --> 02:22.623
Oh yeah? Watch me.

02:24.247 --> 02:25.732
<i>Maudits Québécois.</i>

02:48.939 --> 02:50.604
This directive is from Ottawa?

02:50.724 --> 02:52.962
{\Makes it}- It's pretty official, don't you think?
- Not in Quebec.

02:53.082 --> 02:54.365
Let's not go there.

02:54.485 --> 02:56.179
- Mr. Sandstorm...
- Sandström.

02:56.601 --> 02:59.974
Martin Riopel. I've been directing
this race for 14 years.

03:00.224 --> 03:04.186
Riders have been sick from flu,
colds, dehydration,

03:04.422 --> 03:07.010
we've had snow.
It's all part of the challenge.

03:07.130 --> 03:09.234
- What if it's another SARS outbreak?
- Is it?

03:09.395 --> 03:11.976
- That's what we'{\re here to}ll figure out.
- {\Well, }I'm not canceling the race.

03:12.096 --> 03:15.408
{\Nobody's talking about canceling the race.}I just want to put it on hold
till we know what's going on.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.700
- Nothing is going on.
- Oh really?

03:17.861 --> 03:18.838
Mayko!

03:23.159 --> 03:26.032
Nine riders, absent,
failed to appear for the race.

03:26.152 --> 03:28.559
27 competitors for the Tour Cyclo Quebec

03:28.679 --> 03:30.421
have been admitted to hospital.

03:30.541 --> 03:33.805
7 patients, condition degenerating.
They're just too sick to ride.

03:33.925 --> 03:36.277
I'd say something was going on.
What do you think, Mayko?

03:36.397 --> 03:38.012
I'd say there's something going on.

03:38.172 --> 03:40.598
- <i>Ceci est ridicule !</i>

{\pos(250,245)}I'm very relaxed, Dr. Petras.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.388
{\pos(130,250)}Let your mind go.

05:42.491 --> 05:44.977

{\pos(250,250)}But this isn't working.

05:55.387 --> 05:56.442
{\pos(130,250)}That's okay.

05:56.674 --> 05:59.790
Some individuals
simply don't respond to hypnosis.

05:59.910 --> 06:01.883
It's my Asperger's, isn't it?

06:02.633 --> 06:06.254
Well, we might want to consider
your memory loss as an internal,

06:06.374 --> 06:07.831
neurological block.

06:08.675 --> 06:11.173
The MRI didn't show any brain damage.

06:11.293 --> 06:14.548
{\pos(250,260)}That's what I've been told.
I consulted with your neurologist.

06:15.895 --> 06:17.767
{\pos(130,260)}Did he also tell you
that an MRI doesn't show

06:17.887 --> 06:20.466
{\pos(130,260)}if the synapses have stopped
communicating with one another.

06:20.708 --> 06:21.616
He did.

06:22.016 --> 06:25.262
{\And h}He believes that your neural pathways
aren't functioning as they used to.

06:26.335 --> 06:28.140
I won't have surgery again.

06:28.416 --> 06:29.432
I can't do it.

06:29.552 --> 06:31.477
- I just can't go through with...
- Okay.

06:31.721 --> 06:33.248
Okay. I understand.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.105
Carlos,

06:42.918 --> 06:45.212
these are my notes
on David's report on that drug, Lefelin.

06:45.332 --> 06:47.535
He wanted you to have a read,
and check the literature.

06:47.696 --> 06:49.584
{\Okay, w}When does he go in front of the FDA?

06:49.704 --> 06:50.848
Next week.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.666
- I'll get on it tonight.
- {\Thanks, h}Hopefully it doesn't put you to sleep.

06:54.446 --> 06:55.293
Rachel?

06:57.219 --> 06:58.963
Have you heard from Wes?

06:59.576 --> 07:02.858
No, not yet. But he should be landing
in Stockholm any minute so...

07:02.978 --> 07:06.596
Please, give him my best.
I never had a chance to say goodbye.

07:07.087 --> 07:08.748
Yeah, well, you can...

07:08.868 --> 07:11.254
You can say "hello" when he gets back.

07:11.471 --> 07:12.434
True.

07:20.185 --> 07:22.046
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, Carlos.</i>

07:22.166 --> 07:23.905
David. How's it going out there?

07:24.227 --> 07:27.089
Well, we're not the most
popular scientists on the block.

07:27.209 --> 07:30.150
<i>Je te remercie infiniment,
mon ostie de niaiseux.</i>

07:32.339 --> 07:33.811
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

07:34.683 --> 07:38.002
I've been called an "asshole"
in about ten different languages so far.

07:38.163 --> 07:41.436
- Have you been to the hospital yet?
- No, we're still checking the riders{\ out in the field}.

07:41.556 --> 07:43.183
We should get there this afternoon.

07:43.303 --> 07:46.657
I'll be bringing some samples
back to the lab tonight.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.515
<i>Das ist das Arschloch,
daß das Rennen gestoppt hat.</i>

07:53.200 --> 07:54.380
<i>Danke schön.</i>

07:56.047 --> 07:58.891
Make that "asshole"
in eleven different languages.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.739
Okay, <i>adios cabron</i>.
There, now you have twelve.

08:03.250 --> 08:06.421
Here, here's a list of symptoms.
If you have any questions...

08:06.541 --> 08:09.659
You're welcome.
Just trying to stop an epidemic.

08:11.521 --> 08:14.831
- You don't think that's a good idea{\, or what}?
- Milo. What are you doing here?

08:16.279 --> 08:18.626
Well, the sexy outfit
here doesn't give it away?

08:21.226 --> 08:22.755
It's nice to see you, how are you?

08:22.916 --> 08:24.654
I'm good, I'm better.

08:24.774 --> 08:26.237
- Yeah?
- And you?

08:26.357 --> 08:29.958
What happened to Israel
and Palestine and saving the world?

08:30.078 --> 08:32.515
I had to put that on hold for a while.

08:32.794 --> 08:33.655
Yeah.

08:34.210 --> 08:36.394
I've been training for this
for 3 months now.

08:36.754 --> 08:38.599
You don't think
{\that }we should shut down the race?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.398
{\Well, y}You're the pro from NorBAC, you tell me.

08:40.919 --> 08:44.044
It's got a lot of people worried,
this thing.

08:44.164 --> 08:46.112
Especially
with these SARS-like symptoms{\ that've been reported}.

08:46.273 --> 08:48.457
- They think it's SARS?
- No no, SARS-like symptoms.

08:48.577 --> 08:52.080
We've still got a bunch of tests to run
and people to check out.

08:52.719 --> 08:55.150
- How are you feeling?
- Rock and roll, you know.

08:55.270 --> 08:56.789
67th out of 212.

08:56.950 --> 09:00.626
Wow. Great. That's like... That's, what?
That puts you in the top third?

09:00.941 --> 09:02.470
Sorry, no I mean,

09:03.169 --> 09:05.445
you know, the race is young.
Once we figure this out

09:05.565 --> 09:07.884
you've got plenty of time
to take that yellow jersey.

09:08.045 --> 09:10.011
{\Right, yeah, e}Especially if these other guys
keep dropping out{\, right?}.

09:10.172 --> 09:11.971
{\You know, }I should probably give this to you.

09:12.132 --> 09:15.099
We've set up an emergency
checkup station in Hibbard.

09:15.577 --> 09:16.684
I'm fine.

09:16.846 --> 09:18.838
- No, you should get checked out.{\ Come on.}
- I'm fine.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.480
Just to be safe, Milo.

09:22.225 --> 09:24.042
- Okay, Doc.
- Just take it.

09:26.271 --> 09:27.987
It's, it's nice seeing you.

09:31.580 --> 09:34.660
Is there any chance
of having that be like a personal exam?

09:37.107 --> 09:40.036
- Yeah, I can arrange that.
- Mayko!

09:42.328 --> 09:45.568
- We gotta get to the hospital.
- Dr. Sandström, how are you?

09:45.875 --> 09:48.964
Milo Cohen. I used to come by NorBAC{\ a lot},
I was a bike courier.

09:50.020 --> 09:52.553
Actually,
I came to your house once for dinner.

09:52.825 --> 09:56.646
{\You're t}The guy Mayko dumped 'cause you wanted
to run off and join the Peace Corps{\ or something}?

09:57.371 --> 10:00.321
It was good to see you.
Call about that check-up.

10:01.004 --> 10:02.809
- Let's go.
- Different guy?

10:10.838 --> 10:12.408
I hate uncertainty.

10:14.307 --> 10:16.612
Without {\the }memory of your past,
there will{\ always} be uncertainty

10:16.732 --> 10:18.444
about who you really are.

10:19.381 --> 10:22.850
But really we're just talking
about a 3 month period in your life.

10:23.511 --> 10:27.461
A period perhaps of some extreme
physical and mental distress.

10:32.107 --> 10:33.372
I don't know.

10:34.169 --> 10:37.222
Well, from what you told me,
you've already blacked out,

10:37.500 --> 10:41.265
hearing loss, you've experienced
sensations of falling.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.937
So, what do you suggest?

10:44.523 --> 10:46.469
We've already tried imipramine,

10:46.947 --> 10:48.026
hypnosis,

10:49.175 --> 10:50.861
cognitive behavior experiments.

10:51.383 --> 10:53.797
- And if surgery is off the table.
- It is.

10:55.203 --> 10:58.344
Then, to be honest,
you're just gonna have to give it time.

10:59.222 --> 11:00.793
But there's something...

11:01.918 --> 11:03.442
I don't have the time.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.011
I have to...

11:09.077 --> 11:11.020
Let nature take its course,

11:11.327 --> 11:14.126
if you want,
we can continue to meet weekly.

11:15.251 --> 11:18.430
What do you think
about hyperbaric chambers?

11:20.009 --> 11:21.485
Could they be helpful?

11:23.876 --> 11:25.563
Where did that come from?

11:26.109 --> 11:27.469
What do you think?

11:28.820 --> 11:30.532
Well, I guess it's harmless.

11:30.652 --> 11:34.289
Although, breathing high-pressure oxygen
for an extended period of time

11:34.409 --> 11:35.781
probably isn't a good idea.

11:35.943 --> 11:39.719
But the therapy has been approved
for some specific conditions:

11:40.199 --> 11:44.123
embolisms, carbon monoxide poisoning,
compartment syndrome,

11:44.283 --> 11:47.960
and other acute traumatic problems
where {\the }blood flow is reduced or cut off.

11:48.122 --> 11:51.213
- Sounds like you know more {\about it }than I do{\, Bob}.
- If I have an infection,

11:51.482 --> 11:55.084
{\the }high oxygen level{\s} may kill the bacteria,
decrease the swelling in my brain,

11:55.204 --> 11:57.331
and may improve my memory.

11:58.904 --> 11:59.813
Maybe...

12:00.885 --> 12:01.880
Or make it worse.

12:11.062 --> 12:13.778
They all have fever, shallow breath,
chest pain, and coughs.

12:13.938 --> 12:16.316
- Mucus?
- Some rust-colored, others green.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.947
- Did you get the PCR{\ results}?
- 13 different bacteria

12:19.067 --> 12:22.141
- from 13 different riders.
- Really? And it's not contagious?

12:22.261 --> 12:25.633
The underlying cause could be{\*contagious},
the bacteria could be secondary.

12:25.753 --> 12:28.906
- You're thinking that it's viral?
- That's how we're treating it.

12:29.026 --> 12:31.462
- Are the antivirals working?
- Not yet.

12:31.622 --> 12:34.882
- And it's just in the cyclists?
- So far no locals have been infected.

12:35.397 --> 12:37.037
Alright let's take a look.

12:43.509 --> 12:45.309
Greg Fitzimmons, 24.

12:45.471 --> 12:47.770
- Admitted this morning.
- Hey, Greg, how you doing?

12:48.700 --> 12:50.997
Feels like I got a ton of bricks
on my chest.

12:52.977 --> 12:56.153
We have him on 200 milligrams
of Amantadine. Intravenous fluids.

12:56.315 --> 12:57.794
That's about all we can do.

12:57.914 --> 12:59.170
It's not helping.

12:59.290 --> 13:00.991
{\Greg, }Were you sick {\at all }before the race?

13:01.153 --> 13:02.742
I never get sick.

13:04.171 --> 13:05.663
Have you tested for steroids?

13:08.855 --> 13:10.566
I never use that shit.

13:12.512 --> 13:14.505
- I just can't breathe.
- Alright.

13:14.666 --> 13:16.424
<i>Une tente à oxygène pour le patient{\ Fitzimmons}.</i>

13:16.584 --> 13:18.509
<i>- Tout de suite.</i>
- We'll get you an oxygen tent,

13:18.669 --> 13:20.177
it should make it easier on you.

13:25.381 --> 13:27.635
{\Okay, Mayko, y}You're staying here tonight.
I want everybody logged.

13:27.755 --> 13:31.540
Symptoms, treatments, medical histories,
if anything new comes in, {\you }let me know.

13:31.660 --> 13:33.982
- When are you gonna be back?
- As soon as I've got something.

13:51.073 --> 13:52.011
Hi.

13:52.761 --> 13:53.721
I'm Bob.

13:56.609 --> 13:58.841
This is my first time
in a hyperbaric chamber.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.288
Alright, we're at pressure.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.491
- Everybody okay?
- Okay.

14:06.272 --> 14:07.141
You okay?

14:25.097 --> 14:26.160
Hi, Maya.

14:26.428 --> 14:28.391
Was it fun having a friend today?

14:29.047 --> 14:31.415
You're a real trooper.
Mommy is so proud of you.

14:33.113 --> 14:34.050
Hi,

14:34.425 --> 14:36.840
I'm Bob Melnikov.
This is my first day here.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.088
Erica Browne.

14:38.550 --> 14:40.800
This is our third year
at the foundation.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.968
Maya's on her 80th dive.
She's pretty used to it.

14:43.315 --> 14:47.097
- That's why she's so comfortable{\ in there}.
- She had an oxygen deficiency at birth.

14:47.461 --> 14:48.474
Cerebral palsy?

14:49.690 --> 14:51.588
We're doing great, aren't we?

14:52.921 --> 14:54.119
How bout you?

14:54.893 --> 14:56.115
Yes. Fine.

14:56.235 --> 15:00.569
I{\'m} hope{\ing} {\that }the oxygen therapy will improve
some of the memory loss that I'm having.

15:00.994 --> 15:03.405
- It's pretty amazing, isn't it?
- I hope so.

15:03.567 --> 15:06.616
It's my first day, I don't know yet.
But it certainly works for some things.

15:07.143 --> 15:09.003
That's why we keep coming back.

15:09.459 --> 15:10.996
And you're seeing improvement?

15:11.739 --> 15:14.875
I mean, hoping for a miracle
and not seeing the results you expected.

15:14.995 --> 15:17.020
What makes you think
that we're not seeing results?

15:17.944 --> 15:18.940
Oh, well...

15:20.455 --> 15:23.947
I'm a scientist
and I've studied the clinical trial data

15:24.067 --> 15:28.024
that indicate that hyperbaric treatment
has no effect on CP patients.

15:28.144 --> 15:31.099
I don't need a clinical trial to tell me
that my daughter is improving.

15:31.261 --> 15:33.310
{\I'm s}Sorry,
{\it's just that }I've done quite a bit of research.

15:33.472 --> 15:34.770
So have I, Mr. Melnikov.

15:34.932 --> 15:37.690
I realize{\ that} it's difficult to understand
all the conflicting opinions.

15:39.412 --> 15:42.532
- You're angry. {\Look, }I didn't mean...
- Please don't tell me how I feel.

15:43.774 --> 15:45.364
- I'm sorry.
- I've seen her

15:45.526 --> 15:47.491
- getting better.
- Of course...

15:48.663 --> 15:50.995
{\It's just that y}Your daughter is at an age
when she should be improving anyway.

15:51.448 --> 15:53.873
That's what happens
when CP kids are 6 or 7.

15:53.993 --> 15:56.464
She's getting better every day.
Aren't you?

15:58.458 --> 15:59.560
Let's go away.

16:04.388 --> 16:05.419
Bye, Maya.

16:16.074 --> 16:17.991
I just confirmed it with Dr. Chenard.

16:18.505 --> 16:20.169
You got his case history?

16:20.405 --> 16:24.001
Manuel Danelon. Italian.
Admitted after race day three.

16:24.273 --> 16:26.686
Died at 6:02 PM of respiratory failure.

16:26.806 --> 16:28.365
Shit. Any new patients?

16:28.760 --> 16:31.875
Two. And one's been in and out
of a coma since he was admitted.

16:32.155 --> 16:34.747
- I'm doing the best I can.
<i>- Okay. I'll shoot you what we got</i>

16:34.908 --> 16:36.303
<i>as soon as we get something.</i>

16:37.214 --> 16:39.440
Yeah, the sooner the better.

16:46.788 --> 16:51.096
If you {\were}aren't too busy, I was wondering
if there's {\was }still time for that physical?

16:55.119 --> 16:56.184
Get in here...

17:05.036 --> 17:07.425
... died at 6:02 PM
of respiratory failure.

17:07.807 --> 17:09.281
<i>Shit. Any new patients?</i>

17:09.443 --> 17:12.692
<i>Two. And one's been in and out of a coma
since he was admitted.</i>

17:12.811 --> 17:14.935
{\Okay. }I'll shoot you what we got
as soon as we get something.

17:15.056 --> 17:16.233
<i>{\Yeah, t}The sooner the better.</i>

17:16.890 --> 17:19.238
- We all set?
- Just waiting for you.

17:19.604 --> 17:22.211
Compare these samples
to all known lung infections: CAP,

17:22.371 --> 17:23.886
Eosinophilic pneumonia, everything.

17:24.006 --> 17:26.423
I want to go viral{\ on this} too.
That's where the local doctor's heading.

17:26.704 --> 17:28.308
{\You know, the i}Initial reports I've been getting

17:28.428 --> 17:31.011
show enterobacter
and serratia in the cyclists' lungs.

17:31.173 --> 17:34.556
- Nosocomial infection{\s}?{\Where they get it } In the hospital?
- No, coming with them.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.311
{\They're g}Getting hospital infection{\s} while racing?
How's that happening?

17:38.431 --> 17:40.965
This is sounding like opportunistic
bacteria taking advantage

17:41.085 --> 17:42.984
of weakened immune systems
maybe damaged lungs.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.667
{\Yeah, b}But the riders aren't old,
and they're certainly healthy.

17:45.787 --> 17:48.173
Maybe their metabolisms are compromised.

17:48.437 --> 17:50.863
Maybe they're getting a pre-race,
at a meeting or something?

17:51.025 --> 17:52.368
Or it's doping?

17:52.736 --> 17:55.571
It's not likely. Most doping drugs
actually boost the immune system.

17:55.691 --> 17:58.396
The point is, our cyclist's immune
systems are getting weakened,

17:58.516 --> 18:01.697
{\they're taking on }an opportunistic bacteria
{\that's}is ripping apart their lungs.

18:01.817 --> 18:05.201
Talking about it isn't gonna get us
anywhere, let's get to work.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.099
I think your mom is upset with me.

18:17.190 --> 18:20.352
I didn't want her to think that she'd
made a mistake. It's just that...

18:22.574 --> 18:25.983
That was a very good dive, Maya.
How do you feel?

18:26.190 --> 18:27.233
A little better?

18:28.874 --> 18:30.640
I'm glad you're here, Maya.

18:31.940 --> 18:33.741
I'd be bored all by myself.

18:34.245 --> 18:35.629
Say good-bye now.

18:36.946 --> 18:38.199
See you tomorrow.

18:38.783 --> 18:39.889
Actually, no.

18:40.827 --> 18:42.875
This is our last treatment for a while.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.502
Was it something I said? I'm sorry, I...

18:46.664 --> 18:48.583
We'll be back as soon as we can.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.391
Are you okay?

19:02.012 --> 19:05.980
I know you don't understand, but...
I really do believe the treatments work.

19:08.295 --> 19:09.858
But they're expensive.

19:10.342 --> 19:11.258
I know.

19:12.065 --> 19:15.239
Please don't tell me
I'm throwing my money away.

19:15.816 --> 19:18.421
Erica, I didn't mean
any disrespect yesterday.

19:18.816 --> 19:21.383
I just didn't want you
to have false hopes about Maya.

19:21.503 --> 19:23.572
Try living with CP,

19:23.929 --> 19:25.751
see where you end up looking for hope.

19:26.128 --> 19:29.628
{\Look, }I have a friend {\over }at McMaster University,
he's leading a study on regenerating{\ myelin}...

19:29.748 --> 19:30.713
Good luck!

19:31.340 --> 19:32.493
Let's go, Maya.

19:55.265 --> 19:57.324
What?
{\Hey, w}Where the hell are you?

19:57.486 --> 19:59.114
At the Adele Seward Foundation.

19:59.234 --> 20:01.898
Bob, not that fucking
hyperbaric chamber shit.

20:02.018 --> 20:03.156
It's not shit.

20:03.898 --> 20:06.017
I just wanted
to let you know where I am.

20:06.137 --> 20:07.432
Everything's fine.

20:07.734 --> 20:11.047
- We could really use you back here.
- I have four more dives scheduled...

20:11.167 --> 20:13.016
What are you, Jacques Cousteau?

20:14.894 --> 20:17.635
David, this is very important to me.
Please understand.

20:17.990 --> 20:21.381
Getting your memory back is important
to me too, {\Bob, }but if something comes up...

20:21.501 --> 20:24.433
<i>- I'll be wherever you want me.</i>
- I don't want you there.

20:25.547 --> 20:26.800
Good-bye, David.

20:29.628 --> 20:30.760
Got a minute?

20:31.284 --> 20:32.384
Find Olivier Roth?

20:32.504 --> 20:34.528
I need
to spin the death of Marianne Wiley.

20:35.002 --> 20:36.002
Spin it?

20:36.607 --> 20:38.842
As far as the media is concerned,
we're to blame.

20:38.962 --> 20:41.822
{\Well, t}That's bullshit. I got better things
to do with my time than spinning.

20:41.942 --> 20:43.469
I don't want us to look bad.

20:43.589 --> 20:45.481
She died and NorBAC, well,

20:45.601 --> 20:48.166
- we made the call on which drug to use.
- Alright, here it is.

20:48.328 --> 20:51.735
We had 3 choices. All three drugs
had similar mechanisms for action,

20:51.855 --> 20:53.948
the Questlogic drug had less toxicity.

20:54.068 --> 20:55.924
{\Which means}It was the least likely to cause harm.

20:56.749 --> 20:59.218
So you're suggesting
we blame Questlogic.

21:00.003 --> 21:02.110
Nobody's to blame,
it was an experimental drug,

21:02.230 --> 21:04.765
it was Marianne Wiley's only hope.
And it didn't work.

21:05.563 --> 21:08.257
If anything,
we were asked for our opinion too late.

21:08.377 --> 21:11.330
So, you want to blame somebody,
you can blame the Marines or that...

21:11.450 --> 21:14.025
Hilliard guy
for sticking his head in the sand.

21:14.957 --> 21:16.743
Alright. I can give that a try.

21:16.863 --> 21:18.476
It's the truth, Carl.

21:18.925 --> 21:22.743
{\I mean, }I know that's hard for you to put
out there, but gee, it just might work.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.116
How's the book tour going?

21:29.001 --> 21:30.006
Terrific.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.167
Flying off the shelves. In fact...

21:33.624 --> 21:35.255
before they're all gone,

21:35.564 --> 21:38.026
here's a little going away present.

21:42.252 --> 21:43.363
Now go away.

21:45.055 --> 21:46.035
Thank you.

21:46.478 --> 21:47.546
I feel lucky.

21:48.254 --> 21:50.071
I look forward to reading it.

22:25.999 --> 22:26.892
Hello.

22:29.967 --> 22:31.189
You're ringing.

22:32.656 --> 22:33.751
Your phone.

22:40.678 --> 22:41.556
Hello?

22:43.056 --> 22:44.438
Yeah, it's me.

22:46.375 --> 22:47.180
What?

22:47.803 --> 22:48.870
Okay. When?

22:49.374 --> 22:50.628
When? What time?

22:51.126 --> 22:53.748
- What's going on?
- Okay, yeah, I'll be there.

22:54.626 --> 22:55.819
The race is back on.

22:55.939 --> 22:58.005
- What?
- We're going again at ten.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.966
No, Milo, you can't go back there again.

23:01.126 --> 23:04.636
Mayko, I sacrificed a hell of a lot
to get here. If they say it's okay{\ to go}...

23:04.798 --> 23:07.180
No, but they don't know
what we're dealing with.

23:07.342 --> 23:10.190
- Look, I'll be fine. I gotta go.
- Milo, you...

23:13.377 --> 23:14.848
I'll be fine, okay?

23:16.098 --> 23:17.107
Don't go...

23:18.873 --> 23:19.937
Wish me luck.

23:23.486 --> 23:24.440
Shit.

23:31.016 --> 23:32.112
Yeah, David.

23:32.906 --> 23:33.751
Shit.

23:44.125 --> 23:46.691
Chenard,
who said it was okay to race again?

23:46.811 --> 23:49.192
There was a committee,
they met with Jean Charest.

23:49.312 --> 23:51.510
- Wanna look at the X-rays?
- Yeah.

23:53.813 --> 23:55.479
- {\Hey, w}Welcome back.
- {\You got a}Anything new?

23:56.626 --> 23:57.626
Not yet.

23:58.208 --> 23:59.806
Textbook. All pneumonia.

24:00.315 --> 24:01.877
All different bacteria.

24:02.312 --> 24:04.751
- Something wrong with your {\X-ray }machine?
- Why?

24:04.871 --> 24:05.724
What's this?

24:06.194 --> 24:09.066
And here? Looks like
your machine is leaking light.

24:09.186 --> 24:10.327
Well, it's new.

24:10.636 --> 24:12.720
Could be the film or the developer?

24:13.061 --> 24:14.581
I've never seen this before.

24:14.783 --> 24:17.024
Maybe it's in their lungs.
Maybe something metallic?

24:17.144 --> 24:18.502
Something radioactive?

24:19.702 --> 24:22.256
That would definitely
weaken the immune system.

24:22.655 --> 24:24.257
But we'd see other signs.

24:24.658 --> 24:27.658
{\Yeah, b}But still, it's probably a good idea
to get a full body X-ray.

24:27.778 --> 24:28.551
Okay.

24:30.906 --> 24:31.706
So,

24:32.157 --> 24:35.105
something airborne, maybe radioactive,
got into their lungs?

24:35.388 --> 24:37.381
{\Well i}It could have got {\into their lungs}there
through their bloodstream.

24:37.501 --> 24:39.606
So we can't rule out
{\that }it was something they ingested.

24:39.870 --> 24:42.318
{\Okay, well a}All food and drink tests
are negative for toxins.

24:42.438 --> 24:44.422
We can re-test for radioactivity.

24:45.625 --> 24:47.813
What about other sources of radiation?

24:48.479 --> 24:50.603
Take a look at nuclear power plants,

24:50.723 --> 24:53.052
see if anything could have drifted here.{\faux CP}

24:53.417 --> 24:56.596
- Also, check for metals.
- Okay, we gotta track down an...

24:56.716 --> 24:58.913
Mobile Aerosol Mass Spectrometer,
perhaps?

24:59.033 --> 24:59.785
Yeah.

25:07.210 --> 25:07.926
Hi{\, David}.

25:08.088 --> 25:10.817
- {\Bob, you know y}Your buddy with the Mobile Mass Spec?
- Stephen Hattman?

25:10.937 --> 25:12.909
{\Yeah, y}You think you can get it
up here to Hibbard?

25:13.029 --> 25:15.507
- Sure. I...
- Just get here right now, Bob.

25:16.623 --> 25:18.560
Alright. I'll call Stephen today.

25:19.155 --> 25:19.963
Erica?

25:20.641 --> 25:21.535
Hi, Maya.

25:22.150 --> 25:23.275
This is for you.

25:23.435 --> 25:26.123
This is a list of the most promising
CP therapy trials.

25:26.243 --> 25:28.006
Supported by scientific evidence.

25:28.126 --> 25:30.106
I love that word. "Scientific".

25:30.226 --> 25:34.065
Coffee is bad for you, then suddenly
it's good for diabete{\s} and heart disease.

25:34.185 --> 25:37.121
Echinacea does nothing,
now they say it makes your cold shorter.

25:37.699 --> 25:38.790
Wine is good.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.876
No it isn't.
Is it good again? I can't remember.

25:41.036 --> 25:43.833
Red wine is linked to cancer prevention
and the antioxidants may offer

25:43.953 --> 25:45.922
modest protection against heart disease.

25:46.084 --> 25:47.948
Do you have some kind of on-off button,

25:48.068 --> 25:50.093
where you can sound like
a human being with emotion?

25:50.508 --> 25:52.804
Or are you permanently programmed
in scientist mode?

25:53.665 --> 25:56.194
Look, science is difficult
and it's often misinterpreted,

25:56.314 --> 25:58.534
and we change our minds
when new evidence is discovered.

25:58.654 --> 25:59.600
Please.

26:00.186 --> 26:01.354
I have hopes of my own.

26:02.029 --> 26:04.455
But I have to balance those hopes
with faith, faith in evidence

26:04.575 --> 26:07.435
because that's the best way
to uncover knowledge.

26:07.847 --> 26:09.720
That's why I brought these.

26:10.587 --> 26:11.575
For you.

26:12.230 --> 26:13.268
For Maya.

26:28.956 --> 26:30.008
Good-bye, Maya.

26:30.419 --> 26:32.888
Good-bye.

27:38.654 --> 27:41.259
Everything's fine.
Yeah, everyone is gone.

27:41.379 --> 27:43.915
We just have to remove the specimens
and then we're done.

27:44.275 --> 27:47.853
Yeah, we'll talk after I talk to David,
after I leave NorBAC.

27:50.172 --> 27:52.757
I'm very excited too.
I can't wait to see you.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.655
Okay, bye.

28:58.109 --> 29:00.916
Look, start ventilating SCID mice
with each of the different bacterium.

29:01.036 --> 29:04.287
- Let me know when we get any symptoms.
- You think it might be airborne?

29:04.497 --> 29:06.067
Nothing else is adding up.

29:06.187 --> 29:07.010
Okay...

29:07.130 --> 29:09.844
Look, we know that people
are getting sick with different bacteria

29:09.964 --> 29:11.629
at different times, right?

29:11.831 --> 29:14.823
Maybe they're all
cycling through the same thing.

29:14.943 --> 29:17.007
Like some kind of poisonous cloud?

29:17.875 --> 29:19.902
Maybe... Look, here's what I'm thinking.

29:20.022 --> 29:22.261
Different bacterium have
different growth rates, right?

29:22.381 --> 29:24.082
You get sick after 12 hours from

29:24.202 --> 29:28.585
bacterium X and you get sick
after 18 hours with bacterium Y, etc.

29:28.705 --> 29:30.919
- Right, so you want growth times.
- Yeah.

29:31.039 --> 29:32.487
We work our way backwards,

29:32.607 --> 29:34.606
maybe we'll find a common spot
on the course

29:34.726 --> 29:36.402
where this whole fucking thing started.

29:36.522 --> 29:38.988
Let's find out where it lives,
maybe we can find out what it is.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.388
Let's hope.

29:40.508 --> 29:43.535
I understand you're trying
to shut us down again?

29:44.254 --> 29:47.030
I said I would tell you
when you were good to go again.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.541
<i>Vous réagissez de façon excessive.</i>

29:49.701 --> 29:52.127
- Same to you, Marty.
- No, I said you're overreacting.

29:52.711 --> 29:54.754
I'm told it's not even contagious!

29:54.915 --> 29:57.382
- We haven't ruled that out.
- Well, do you have anything?

29:59.961 --> 30:02.273
No, this time, the race will not stop.

30:02.393 --> 30:04.959
NorBAC has jurisdiction here.

30:05.079 --> 30:08.037
Not in Quebec. Nor does Ottawa.

30:08.899 --> 30:10.715
I have the piece of paper this time.

30:10.835 --> 30:14.391
The government of Quebec
says the race will continue.

30:14.601 --> 30:16.693
I don't give a shit
what the government of...

30:17.685 --> 30:19.320
He's one of the race officials.

30:23.559 --> 30:24.659
Oh my God, Milo!

30:25.381 --> 30:27.302
No no no, wait wait wait!
Hold on! Hold on!

30:28.032 --> 30:30.331
You wanna help him,
you help me, alright?

30:32.598 --> 30:34.307
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's get back to work.

30:34.427 --> 30:35.214
Okay.

30:46.649 --> 30:48.600
Prelim analysis of the bacteria.

30:49.103 --> 30:50.400
I'll call Hibbard.

30:51.213 --> 30:53.045
I got an e-mail from Wes.

30:53.882 --> 30:55.748
Yeah, he passed his physical.

30:55.868 --> 30:57.817
He's strong enough
to start the RNAi treatment.

30:58.027 --> 31:00.069
- That's terrific.
- Yeah.

31:00.279 --> 31:01.488
Fingers crossed, huh?

31:02.257 --> 31:04.178
I'm sure it's going to be fine.

31:04.918 --> 31:06.721
You can always change your mind.

31:06.841 --> 31:07.841
<i>About what?</i>

31:09.079 --> 31:11.915
Carlos has the detailed analysis
of the bacterial growth curve

31:12.075 --> 31:14.853
from the first 18 cyclists,
and I'm working on the others.

31:14.973 --> 31:16.199
<i>Thanks, Rachel.</i>

31:17.588 --> 31:19.664
So, have you managed
to shut down the race yet?

31:20.782 --> 31:23.148
No, I'm having some problems
with the race director.

31:23.268 --> 31:25.617
We're gonna have to do this
with the science.

31:25.997 --> 31:28.815
<i>Okay, first case, Alain Dubois.
Growth time, 12 hours.</i>

31:28.935 --> 31:32.759
Okay, what was his average speed
per day of race?

31:33.231 --> 31:36.272
About 35 kilometers an hour,
6 hours per day.

31:36.434 --> 31:38.810
210 kilometers, 12-hour growth rate.

31:39.590 --> 31:41.615
You head out to sleep, you start at 7,

31:41.735 --> 31:44.939
puts him back at kilometer 360.

31:45.151 --> 31:47.033
- Okay, 360.
- Next.

31:47.995 --> 31:50.078
- Christian Buzek...
<i>- Oh, hang on a second.</i>

31:53.011 --> 31:55.416
<i>Okay, this is it. You keep working on...</i>

31:56.182 --> 31:57.577
<i>graphing this with Mayko.</i>

32:01.105 --> 32:03.708
- Okay, Chrisian Buzek.
- Hello. Oui.

32:03.968 --> 32:05.863
<i>Mon nom est David Sandström.</i>

32:05.983 --> 32:07.282
<i>Avec NorBAC.</i>

32:08.486 --> 32:09.462
NorBAC.

32:09.974 --> 32:10.770
<i>Oui...</i>

32:11.635 --> 32:13.401
<i>je veux parler avec...</i>

32:14.125 --> 32:17.191
<i>de ministre... du Santé...</i>

32:17.361 --> 32:19.720
<i>Madame Beaudoitte, Beaudette!</i>

32:22.743 --> 32:23.877
Slow down.

32:25.781 --> 32:27.065
<i>S'il vous plaît !</i>

32:28.818 --> 32:31.846
{\Look, y}You know what? I know you speak English
better than I speak French

32:31.966 --> 32:33.621
so could you{\ just }cut me some slack here?

32:33.782 --> 32:35.323
... kilometer 355.

32:35.751 --> 32:37.274
Don't give me attitude.

32:37.394 --> 32:40.315
{\ look, }just tell the Madame
to cancel the race, okay?

32:41.090 --> 32:43.985
The Tour Cyclo Quebec! Shut it down!

32:47.624 --> 32:49.053
Where's Wes when you need him?

32:50.225 --> 32:51.931
Wes couldn't speak French either.

32:52.051 --> 32:54.684
Yeah but Wes knows you can catch
more flies with honey than with vinegar.

32:56.763 --> 32:59.606
Kilometer 380, 60, 61...

33:00.643 --> 33:01.393
Next?

33:02.360 --> 33:05.737
<i>Look at the 42nd cyclist, Milo Cohen.</i>

33:05.947 --> 33:08.460
<i>I figure him at about kilometer 420.</i>

33:09.784 --> 33:12.415
Okay, what are the numbers
on the dead cyclist?

33:13.579 --> 33:17.595
<i>Gabriel extrapolated onset
of symptoms about 30 hours.</i>

33:18.288 --> 33:20.546
Okay, so that's two 6-hour cycling days.

33:20.666 --> 33:23.668
Averaging 40 kilometers an hour,
that's 480.

33:23.788 --> 33:25.891
Putting him at first contact at

33:26.011 --> 33:28.883
kilometer 380.

33:29.882 --> 33:33.548
Which means the point of infection
is approximately Tuesday,

33:34.039 --> 33:35.060
<i>five-ish...</i>

33:36.018 --> 33:37.802
Kilometer 396.

33:38.062 --> 33:40.518
Yeah, but there's nothing really there.

33:41.509 --> 33:43.900
Well, let's go look at nothing.

33:48.538 --> 33:49.892
So when's it done?

33:50.443 --> 33:51.958
It's sampling the air all the time.

33:52.078 --> 33:53.931
It separates every airborne molecule

33:54.051 --> 33:57.830
and tells us almost instantly what
they are by measuring mass and charge.

33:57.991 --> 33:58.722
Cool.

33:59.166 --> 34:00.241
Ouh, see this?

34:01.204 --> 34:04.203
Silica particle, specific to the Sahara
desert. Picked it up just now.

34:04.719 --> 34:07.498
- Here? But that's...
- 6,000 kilometers away.

34:08.513 --> 34:09.734
Wow, that's crazy.

34:09.904 --> 34:13.489
Yeah, but I doubt people
are getting sick from inhaling sand.

34:19.788 --> 34:22.764
Coal dust, some iron and minerals
common to smelting.

34:23.315 --> 34:26.559
There's also sodium, potassium, pollen,

34:26.770 --> 34:29.353
and some metallic particles
in high concentrations.

34:29.474 --> 34:31.242
Mostly an aluminum alloy.

34:31.913 --> 34:33.596
And radioactive particles.

34:34.152 --> 34:35.085
Minute traces.

34:35.206 --> 34:38.413
Okay, so that's negative
on all nuclear power plants.

34:38.623 --> 34:42.172
The Americans have nothing to report and
AEC says all CANDU reactors are clean.

34:42.552 --> 34:45.168
The rest of the world's reactors
equally pleased with themselves?

34:45.288 --> 34:46.699
Monitoring turned up nothing.

34:46.820 --> 34:48.900
So maybe radiation
got us looking the other way,

34:49.020 --> 34:51.050
and aluminum particles snuck in.

34:51.260 --> 34:52.178
But how?

34:52.795 --> 34:53.835
From where?

34:54.047 --> 34:56.938
{\Well, a}Aluminum chloride is used to
manufacture compact fluorescent lamps,

34:57.058 --> 34:59.350
industrial glass,
water treatment chemicals, filters,

34:59.560 --> 35:02.133
fire retardant, smoke suppressant,
ceramics, hip replacements...

35:02.253 --> 35:04.897
- What isn't it used for?
- That's an even longer list.

35:05.107 --> 35:07.098
We're in the middle of nowhere!

35:07.303 --> 35:09.766
It's got to be coming in from somewhere.

35:10.897 --> 35:13.781
So I've sent you electron microscope
images of the lung biopsy.

35:13.951 --> 35:17.910
The dead cyclist had significant amounts
of aluminum chloride in his lungs.

35:18.112 --> 35:20.368
The microparticles can cause
deep tissue damage.

35:20.488 --> 35:22.675
This could easily allow
a portal for the bacteria,

35:22.795 --> 35:24.279
it would affect the immune system.

35:24.679 --> 35:27.211
<i>We've got location and time.
We still haven't found the source.</i>

35:27.372 --> 35:29.968
- Industrial pollution?
- There's not much up here.

35:30.088 --> 35:32.272
But we did find traces
of radioactivity though.

35:32.392 --> 35:34.523
So what has aluminum chloride

35:35.354 --> 35:36.682
and is radioactive?

35:38.434 --> 35:39.514
{\Look,}I'll call you back.

35:40.960 --> 35:43.519
Canadian Air Transport
Security Authority

35:43.681 --> 35:46.439
reports no industrial
or military leaks, explosions,

35:46.599 --> 35:48.611
you name it, they don't know about it.

35:49.166 --> 35:51.923
DARPA's got an upper atmosphere
bacteria detection program,

35:52.043 --> 35:54.072
but they don't use aluminum chloride.

35:54.466 --> 35:56.273
{\So w}Where the hell is it coming from?

35:57.837 --> 36:00.061
I've got something.
{\Well, a}Actually three "somethings".

36:00.181 --> 36:03.289
First, a dating on the aluminum.
It's approximately 40 years old.

36:03.564 --> 36:05.852
- How do you know that?
- Production of aluminum chloride

36:05.972 --> 36:08.384
has improved over the decades.
Impurities are the key.

36:08.504 --> 36:11.881
The aluminum particles that we found
had an impurity ratio of 7 to 1,

36:12.421 --> 36:15.115
consistent with the production
in the mid 1960s.

36:15.412 --> 36:17.309
Okay. 40-year-old aluminum. What else?

36:17.429 --> 36:21.307
A dusting of sodium and potassium
but I'm not sure what's the correlation{\ is, if any}.

36:21.427 --> 36:22.598
{\What's y}Your third "something"?

36:22.720 --> 36:25.311
Elemental analysis shows that {\the }aluminum

36:25.473 --> 36:27.441
was impregnated with carbon.

36:27.794 --> 36:30.784
{\Okay,}So the aluminum
may have been through a fire.

36:30.904 --> 36:35.029
{\So }I looked into any chemical plants that
may have gone up in flames, nothing.

36:35.697 --> 36:37.490
But get this:

36:37.774 --> 36:40.373
The carbon with the aluminum
chloride particles that we found

36:40.493 --> 36:44.163
was 78 % carbon-12 and 22 % carbon-13.

36:44.878 --> 36:45.911
Meaning?

36:47.210 --> 36:49.821
Carbon with that ratio
is never seen here...

36:51.084 --> 36:52.014
on Earth.

36:53.938 --> 36:55.507
Little green men in space ships?

36:55.710 --> 36:56.772
No, David.

36:57.101 --> 37:00.755
But based on the carbon ratio,
it had to have come from somewhere else.

37:00.875 --> 37:03.391
There was that meteor
that went down in Peru.

37:03.887 --> 37:04.712
Yes!

37:05.982 --> 37:06.796
No...

37:06.961 --> 37:09.433
{\Those people}They got sick from stuff
that was kicked up by impact.

37:10.001 --> 37:13.475
{\Well, }And meteors aren't made out
of 40-year-old aluminum chloride.

37:14.819 --> 37:15.625
Shit...

37:39.128 --> 37:40.226
Of course.

37:40.922 --> 37:41.949
So obvious.

37:45.396 --> 37:47.881
<i>- Hey Rachel, you there?</i>
- Yeah, I'm still here.

37:48.001 --> 37:50.594
I'm on hold
with one of Wes' NASA contacts.

37:50.864 --> 37:52.911
- It's a little weird.
<i>- What?</i>

37:53.641 --> 37:56.194
Well, I'm in his office
and it seems awfully empty.

37:56.354 --> 37:58.321
Buy a plant. What does NASA have to say?

37:59.298 --> 38:01.536
When are you gonna hire a replacement?

38:01.758 --> 38:03.833
I don't know.
What does NASA have to say?

38:03.953 --> 38:06.977
It's a long shot, but they're checking.
Although they do admit

38:07.097 --> 38:10.258
that there's over 4 million pounds
of space junk orbiting Earth, so...

38:10.378 --> 38:12.836
The US tracks
more than 10,000 pieces of debris,

38:12.956 --> 38:15.144
anything four inches wide or larger.

38:15.264 --> 38:17.671
Everything from nuts and bolts
to an old telescope.

38:17.791 --> 38:20.645
{\Alright, well l}Let's say we're dealing
with a 10,000 pound satellite,

38:20.765 --> 38:22.193
{\that's been }flying around for 40 years,

38:22.313 --> 38:25.914
{\being }bombarded by millions of small particles
from meteorites and other space shit.

38:26.034 --> 38:28.642
Those particles get fused
to the satellite's aluminum.

38:28.844 --> 38:30.176
- Nice.
- So,

38:30.805 --> 38:32.117
the satellite...

38:32.460 --> 38:33.551
loses orbit,

38:34.112 --> 38:37.275
enters the atmosphere, burns up,
and releases{\ a cloud of} aluminum chloride,

38:38.205 --> 38:39.862
speckled with cosmic carbon.

38:40.345 --> 38:44.810
Right. The cyclists{\, they} hit kilometer 396
and they pass right through that cloud.

38:44.930 --> 38:47.070
{\And }They would have been
breathing heavy from the climb.

38:47.263 --> 38:49.503
Particles get into their lungs,
cause tissue damage,

38:49.623 --> 38:53.250
lower their immune systems and
open the door{\s} to opportunistic bacteria.

38:54.664 --> 38:55.851
Hang on, David.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.365
Yes?

39:02.594 --> 39:03.484
Really?

39:07.918 --> 39:09.392
Yes I will, thank you.

39:10.372 --> 39:11.101
David?

39:12.361 --> 39:13.578
What do you got?

39:13.698 --> 39:17.729
So NASA did track a satellite
that went down north of Nitchequon,

39:17.849 --> 39:20.042
at kilometer 396.

39:20.314 --> 39:21.812
And when did it come down?

39:22.053 --> 39:24.365
<i>The night before
the second stage of the race.</i>

39:24.800 --> 39:25.959
When did it go up?

39:26.278 --> 39:27.903
<i>- In 1966.</i>
- There you go.

39:28.023 --> 39:30.101
God, and NASA didn't think
to warn anybody?

39:30.221 --> 39:32.789
- Is it one of their satellites?
- They're still looking into it.

39:33.066 --> 39:36.464
Shouldn't be too difficult, on average
there's only two coming down every week.

39:37.038 --> 39:39.761
Have Carlos call the local docs,
let them know what we got:

39:39.881 --> 39:43.118
{\Thing to do is to keep }they must clean{\ing} out the cyclists' lungs.
That should work over time.

39:43.238 --> 39:45.462
Then call Parks Canada,
have them close down the area

39:45.582 --> 39:47.929
till we can confirm {\the }aluminum chloride
is dissipated.

39:48.336 --> 39:49.613
<i>See you soon.</i>

39:51.430 --> 39:55.420
You mind if I stick around {\for }another day?{\I'd like to check up on that guy that I dumped.}
I'd like to know about the guy I dumped.

39:56.593 --> 39:57.539
Take a couple.

39:58.243 --> 39:59.175
Thanks.

40:19.507 --> 40:20.521
Hey, babe.

40:29.047 --> 40:31.181
- Am I too sick to kiss?
- Definitely.

40:33.310 --> 40:35.007
Otherwise you'd be all over me, right?

40:35.127 --> 40:36.552
No problem there.

40:50.072 --> 40:50.881
So,

40:52.315 --> 40:54.212
where do you think you wanna go?

40:57.062 --> 40:57.850
What?

40:58.664 --> 41:00.545
{\Well, }You're gonna be out of here
in a day or two,

41:00.696 --> 41:03.930
I thought you might want
a bit more time to convalesce.

41:06.194 --> 41:07.134
Yeah.

41:09.428 --> 41:11.806
I know a great place
in the Eastern Townships.

41:12.832 --> 41:14.625
- Is there a bed?
- Yeah.

41:15.459 --> 41:16.560
And a floor.

41:21.297 --> 41:22.893
- A kitchen table.
- Nice.

41:23.013 --> 41:24.985
A porch, a bathtub.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.872
A lot of places we can convalesce.

41:29.233 --> 41:30.261
Sounds sweet.

42:13.002 --> 42:14.660
You smell delicious.

42:15.182 --> 42:16.154
Careful!

42:21.105 --> 42:22.042
What's in that?

42:23.621 --> 42:27.131
- Sea salt, flakes of red pepper...
- That's not what I taste.

42:29.182 --> 42:30.604
Wanna taste again?

42:31.629 --> 42:34.029
Oh, that's my secret: Tequila!

42:34.299 --> 42:35.513
There's something else.

42:36.095 --> 42:38.809
- Get taste, taste, taste.
- Wanna taste again?

42:42.047 --> 42:43.853
Okay, give me my finger back.

42:45.915 --> 42:47.720
Now I know what I taste.

42:49.852 --> 42:50.652
You!

42:51.447 --> 42:53.491
Well I always add a touch of Nina.

42:56.136 --> 42:57.009
Nina...

42:57.888 --> 42:59.130
<i>Dr. Melnikov?</i>

43:00.607 --> 43:01.407
Nina.

43:02.118 --> 43:04.034
We're gonna lower the pressure for you.

43:06.647 --> 43:07.983
I know her name!

43:09.004 --> 43:09.804
Nina!

43:13.160 --> 43:14.900
<i>Dr. Melnikov, just hang on!</i>

43:17.605 --> 43:19.840
<i>We're gonna get you out of there!</i>

43:28.861 --> 43:30.964
{\pos(192,230)}- Yeah, I'll be right there.
- What's wrong?

43:31.275 --> 43:32.840
{\pos(192,230)}Bob had a seizure last night.

43:32.960 --> 43:36.076
You went into the chamber, ten minutes
later, you're on the floor drooling.

43:36.196 --> 43:38.536
David, I need to examine a real heart.

43:39.115 --> 43:41.700
It's been embalmed.
I can't do anything with this!

43:41.820 --> 43:44.124
Wes wrote up an entire protocol
on organ recovery.

43:44.286 --> 43:47.180
- {\I don't understand}Why you{\'d} want to do his job?
- I don't want to do his job.

43:47.300 --> 43:50.217
- I {\just }don't want anybody {\else }to screw it up.
- So you did.

43:50.337 --> 43:52.754
Listen, that was fun the other night,
we should get together.

43:52.874 --> 43:55.107
You feel like flying up for the weekend?

43:55.227 --> 43:58.196
Lefelin was designed
to lower the immune response

43:58.316 --> 44:00.891
in people who suffer
from autoimmune diseases.

44:01.053 --> 44:02.476
But, for an unknown reason,

44:02.982 --> 44:05.396
it raises the likelihood
of congestive heart failure.

44:05.557 --> 44:07.763
Another death in a Lefelin patient.

44:07.883 --> 44:10.481
600 dead, Mr. Riddlemeyer.

44:10.601 --> 44:13.500
What if that's just the tip
of the iceberg {\What if }and next year it's 6,000?

44:13.620 --> 44:16.240
- Lefelin will remain on the market.
- That's insane!

44:16.400 --> 44:18.325
My wife is dying because of Lefelin!

44:18.486 --> 44:19.994
I want that drug's withdrawal.

44:20.305 --> 44:26.576
