01:46.040 --> 01:47.371
<i>Minions.</i>

01:48.000 --> 01:51.925
<i>Minions have been on this planet
far longer than we have.</i>

01:52.440 --> 01:56.889
<i>They go by many names.
Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike.</i>

01:59.040 --> 02:00.883
<i>Oh, that one is Norbert.</i>

02:01.840 --> 02:03.285
<i>He's an idiot.</i>

02:03.360 --> 02:06.489
<i>They're all different,
but they all share the same goal.</i>

02:07.640 --> 02:10.723
<i>To serve the most despicable
master they could find.</i>

02:10.800 --> 02:11.801
Boss!

02:17.240 --> 02:20.722
<i>Making their master happy was
the tribe's very reason for existence.</i>

02:22.240 --> 02:24.925
<i>But that's not to say
that they didn't have other passions.</i>

02:33.240 --> 02:34.241
Huh?

02:34.960 --> 02:36.405
<i>Finding a boss was easy.</i>

02:37.920 --> 02:40.924
<i>But keeping a boss,
therein lies the rub.</i>

03:22.280 --> 03:25.250
<i>Nope,
it wasn't easy for these guys.</i>

03:25.320 --> 03:26.970
<i>But they never gave up.</i>

03:27.840 --> 03:29.569
<i>With the emergence
of the Stone Age</i>

03:29.640 --> 03:32.883
<i>came the rise
of a new species.</i>

03:32.960 --> 03:35.691
<i>Man was very different
from the dinosaur.</i>

03:35.760 --> 03:37.330
<i>He was shorter, hairier,</i>

03:37.400 --> 03:40.051
<i>and way, way smarter.</i>

03:45.720 --> 03:48.326
<i>The Minions took
an instant liking to man,</i>

03:48.400 --> 03:50.289
<i>and helped him
the best they could.</i>

03:53.240 --> 03:54.730
Oh, no, no.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.484
Eh?

04:08.280 --> 04:11.727
<i>Poor man.
So trusting, so fragile.</i>

04:12.240 --> 04:14.322
<i>So, so delicious!</i>

04:15.200 --> 04:18.249
<i>Their quest for a boss
put the Minions front and center</i>

04:18.360 --> 04:21.682
<i>for some of civilization's
most historic moments.</i>

04:23.640 --> 04:25.847
Anubis!

04:26.960 --> 04:30.123
<i>Ancient Egypt
held great promise.</i>

04:31.480 --> 04:34.563
Okay! Pancake!

04:36.880 --> 04:38.564
<i>But it didn't last long.</i>

04:38.720 --> 04:40.131
Hmm. Oh!

04:42.280 --> 04:43.281
Ow!

04:43.720 --> 04:46.644
<i>The Dark Ages were
actually fun times.</i>

04:48.440 --> 04:50.329
<i>Their new master
had a tendency</i>

04:50.400 --> 04:53.324
<i>to party all night
and sleep all day.</i>

04:54.720 --> 04:56.085
Ooh!

05:09.360 --> 05:10.361
Oh.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.681
<i>But eventually,
the party was over.</i>

05:16.080 --> 05:19.129
<i>They bounced from
one evil boss to another,</i>

05:19.200 --> 05:21.567
<i>but they never seemed
to find their perfect fit.</i>

05:25.160 --> 05:28.960
<i>One particular employer
took their failure very, very badly.</i>

05:37.720 --> 05:39.085
Huh?

05:40.520 --> 05:43.569
<i>The Minions had no other
choice but to keep moving.</i>

05:47.320 --> 05:49.163
Oh.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.720
<i>And then,
when all hope seemed lost,</i>

05:52.560 --> 05:54.608
<i>they found sanctuary.</i>

05:55.600 --> 05:57.602
<i>The Minions were safe!</i>

06:25.320 --> 06:29.689
<i>Years passed as the
Minions forged their own civilization.</i>

06:29.760 --> 06:32.604
<i>They truly made
a life for themselves.</i>

06:32.680 --> 06:35.081
<i>But something just wasn't right.</i>

06:41.400 --> 06:43.084
<i>They felt empty inside.</i>

06:43.160 --> 06:45.401
<i>Without a master,
they had no purpose.</i>

06:45.480 --> 06:48.245
<i>They became aimless
and depressed.</i>

06:53.680 --> 06:58.049
<i>If this continued any longer,
the Minions would perish.</i>

07:00.200 --> 07:04.922
<i>But all was not lost
for one Minion had a plan.</i>

07:05.560 --> 07:08.040
<i>His name was Kevin.</i>

07:10.280 --> 07:14.126
<i>He was excited to share
his idea with the tribe.</i>

07:14.200 --> 07:18.046
<i>He'd been preparing
for days, weeks, months.</i>

07:18.920 --> 07:20.729
<i>But now he was ready.</i>

07:32.880 --> 07:34.370
Buddies!

07:44.040 --> 07:45.883
<i>Kevin would leave the cave...</i>

07:45.960 --> 07:47.644
<i>...go back
to the outside world,</i>

07:47.720 --> 07:50.087
<i>and he would not return
until he had found his tribe</i>

07:50.160 --> 07:52.527
<i>the biggest,
baddest villain to serve.</i>

07:53.800 --> 07:55.325
<i>But he needed help.</i>

07:55.400 --> 07:56.526
Me!

07:57.960 --> 07:59.644
<i>Bob was eager to go,</i>

07:59.720 --> 08:02.007
<i>But Kevin felt he was
just not strong enough</i>

08:02.080 --> 08:04.003
<i>for the dangerous journey ahead.</i>

08:04.080 --> 08:06.082
Uh, no.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.329
<i>Luckily, someone stepped up.</i>

08:15.400 --> 08:16.400
Stuart!

08:17.600 --> 08:19.762
Huh? Me, me?
Oh! Thank you.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.844
<i>Truth be told,
Stuart had no idea what he was chosen for...</i>

08:25.280 --> 08:28.602
<i>...but was thrilled
it made people cheer for him.</i>

08:28.680 --> 08:30.284
Thank you.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.770
Me!

08:45.080 --> 08:46.684
Eh, okay.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.046
<i>Eventually,
Bob's energy and enthusiasm,</i>

08:58.120 --> 09:01.841
<i>but mostly lack of other volunteers,
changed Kevin's mind.</i>

09:08.640 --> 09:10.642
<i>The tribe said their farewells.</i>

09:10.720 --> 09:14.167
<i>Kevin had given them something
they hadn't had in a very long time.</i>

09:14.280 --> 09:15.520
<i>Hope.</i>

09:16.120 --> 09:17.724
Bob!

09:17.880 --> 09:19.848
Hey, Tony!

09:20.000 --> 09:21.604
Tom...

09:21.720 --> 09:24.564
Chris...

09:24.640 --> 09:26.005
Hey, Bob.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.208
Oh.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.210
Bye-bye.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.247
<i>Kevin felt pride.</i>

09:41.320 --> 09:43.926
<i>He was going to be
the one to save his tribe.</i>

09:44.920 --> 09:47.924
<i>Stuart felt hungry mostly.</i>

09:48.000 --> 09:50.685
<i>He was going to be the one
to eat this banana.</i>

09:52.240 --> 09:54.049
<i>And Bob...</i>

09:55.600 --> 09:58.365
<i>Bob was frightened
of the journey ahead.</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:01.726
Ah. Okay.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.166
Okay. Okay.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.005
<i>And they were off.</i>

10:17.080 --> 10:20.368
<i>Off to find their new boss!</i>

10:40.560 --> 10:42.210
Huh? Kevin!

11:00.840 --> 11:02.171
Huh?

11:08.560 --> 11:09.971
Huh? Banana!

11:11.240 --> 11:13.766
Uh, Stuart?

11:14.280 --> 11:16.123
Banana. Banana!

11:17.920 --> 11:20.526
Ugh! Ugh! Stuart!

11:20.600 --> 11:21.965
Stopa!

11:23.280 --> 11:25.851
Uh, Bob! Stopa!

11:35.600 --> 11:36.681
Huh? Oh!

11:38.160 --> 11:39.969
Bob!
Huh?

11:59.800 --> 12:01.404
Uh, no, no.
No, no. No, no, no.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.005
Profiterole.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.681
No, no, no!

12:09.560 --> 12:10.800
Stuart...

12:11.000 --> 12:12.081
Ah!

12:19.320 --> 12:20.765
Oh, look at that one!
Whoa!

12:24.320 --> 12:26.163
Peace!
Make love, not war!

12:26.240 --> 12:27.321

Okay.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.244

Go, go, go!

20:40.920 --> 20:42.800
Okey-dokey. On the road again.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.049
Dad! We got company!

20:53.120 --> 20:56.203
It's because I tripped
the alarm. I stink!

20:56.280 --> 20:59.841
Hey, we all make mistakes, sugarplum.
You're still learning.

21:01.520 --> 21:02.646
Huh! What?

21:02.720 --> 21:04.961
- Your father's right, Tina.
- Reload!

21:05.040 --> 21:06.929
He wasn't this good
at being evil overnight!

21:07.000 --> 21:08.764
Reload!
Your time's coming.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.325
It's jammed!

21:17.680 --> 21:18.681
Huh?

21:48.040 --> 21:49.201
Okay, who did that?

21:49.320 --> 21:51.687
- Uh... Stuart!
- Huh?

21:51.800 --> 21:53.404
That was great!

21:53.560 --> 21:55.130
Thank you!

21:57.000 --> 22:00.402
Say, fellas,
can we get personal
for just a second?

22:00.480 --> 22:03.529
Why are you going to Orlando?

22:05.480 --> 22:08.563
Come on. You can tell us.
You're going to Villain-Con, aren't you?

22:08.760 --> 22:10.440
Villain-Con.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.164
Villain-Con.

22:12.240 --> 22:15.847
Wow! So many bad guys
in the car. What fun!

22:15.920 --> 22:18.969
I knew it!
I knew you were villains!
Didn't I, honey?

22:19.040 --> 22:21.850
What a small world!
Hope we're not in rival gangs.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.446
Binky! Joke!
Babies, huh?

22:53.280 --> 22:54.930
Yay.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.323
Big boss!

23:27.520 --> 23:28.806
When we get to Orlando,

23:28.880 --> 23:31.531
I'm gonna get all my favorite
villains to sign my magazine!

23:31.600 --> 23:34.171
Dumo the Sumo!

23:34.240 --> 23:35.890
Boss!

23:35.960 --> 23:39.885
Oh, Kevin,
you don't wanna work for him!
He ate his last henchmen!

23:39.960 --> 23:40.961
Uh...

23:41.040 --> 23:43.088
Frankie Fish Lips.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.525
He lives in the ocean.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.409
Boss?
Oh...

23:46.640 --> 23:48.005
Can you breathe underwater?

23:48.080 --> 23:49.525
Uh, so-so.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.886
Oh, oh, oh!

23:50.960 --> 23:53.725
Look at her!
Scarlet Overkill!

23:53.800 --> 23:56.485
The coolest super-villain,
like, ever!

23:56.560 --> 24:00.121
She started out as your average little girl,
braces, pigtails.

24:00.200 --> 24:04.524
But by the time she was 13,
she built a criminal empire!

24:04.640 --> 24:08.361
If I was a Minion,
that's who I'd want to work for!

24:08.440 --> 24:10.602
Oh.

24:10.760 --> 24:13.286
Here we are!
Beautiful Orlando!

24:13.360 --> 24:14.805
Yeah! We're here!

24:18.720 --> 24:20.768
Orlando!

24:33.200 --> 24:34.611
Hey, gang, watch this!

24:35.680 --> 24:38.968
<i>Welcome to Billy Bob's Bait Shop.
How can I help you?</i>

24:39.080 --> 24:40.923
Yeah, hi.
Uh...

24:41.280 --> 24:44.409
We're here for, uh,
so much fun, it's a crime.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.081
Whoo-hoo!

25:06.160 --> 25:07.685
Villain-Con!

25:12.880 --> 25:14.484
All right!
Here we go!

25:15.080 --> 25:19.688
Well, this is it!
I wanna tell you, and I really mean this.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.091
I really appreciate what you did

25:21.160 --> 25:22.889
back there with the cops.
Really!

25:23.000 --> 25:25.128
Dad!
It's Frankie Fish Lips!

25:25.200 --> 25:27.248
I can smell him from here!

25:27.320 --> 25:28.651
Junior!
Get my camera!

25:28.720 --> 25:30.768
Good luck in there, boys!

25:30.880 --> 25:33.121
I hope you find what
you're looking for!

25:33.200 --> 25:34.247
Bye!

25:36.720 --> 25:38.210
Villain-Con!

25:38.280 --> 25:39.281
Yeah!

25:39.520 --> 25:41.727
Villain-Con!
Whoo!

25:43.080 --> 25:45.082
Okay!

25:47.280 --> 25:49.647
Oh!

25:50.960 --> 25:52.962
Any evil talents?

25:55.240 --> 25:56.287
Not bad.

25:56.760 --> 25:59.001
What about you?
Any evil talents?

25:59.080 --> 26:00.127
Uh...

26:00.640 --> 26:03.325
Bello!
La, la, la!
La, la, la!

26:03.400 --> 26:04.401
Eh?

26:04.480 --> 26:06.881
That's not evil or a talent.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.327
Bello!

26:17.080 --> 26:18.081
Ha-ha!

26:18.480 --> 26:19.481
No?

26:19.960 --> 26:23.362
I'm sorry! But I'm not looking
for any more servants,

26:23.440 --> 26:26.808
for I, Professor Flux,
have invented

26:26.880 --> 26:29.565
the world's first time machine!

26:29.640 --> 26:35.602
Every time I visit the future,
I bring my future self back to help me.

26:35.680 --> 26:36.681
Hello!

26:36.960 --> 26:37.961
Oh.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.922
Move that over there,
Professor Flux from two weeks from now.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.049
As you can see,
I don't need any help.

26:47.480 --> 26:51.690
Oh, way to go, guys.
We killed the original!

26:55.280 --> 26:56.281
Please!

26:56.920 --> 26:58.888
Eh...

27:00.040 --> 27:02.441
<i>Villain-Con presents our keynote speaker,</i>

27:02.520 --> 27:05.285
<i>Scarlet Overkill!</i>

27:05.360 --> 27:07.931
<i>The world's first
female super-villain!</i>

27:09.200 --> 27:12.329
<i>Appearing right now in Hall H!
Bob! Stuart! Buddies! Hey!</i>

27:12.440 --> 27:14.681
Buddies!

27:14.760 --> 27:15.966
Scarlet?

27:16.040 --> 27:17.405
Kevin!

27:18.040 --> 27:20.771
<i>Are you ready...</i>

27:21.880 --> 27:23.723
Yeah!

27:23.800 --> 27:26.406
<i>...for Scarlet Overkill!</i>

27:30.960 --> 27:34.487
Doesn't it feel
so good to be bad?

27:34.560 --> 27:36.050
Scarlet! Scarlet! Scarlet!
Yes!

27:36.120 --> 27:37.360
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

27:43.000 --> 27:44.286
Whoa.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.091
Whoo-hoo!

27:58.840 --> 28:00.330
Awesome!

28:01.200 --> 28:02.326
Yeah!

28:02.400 --> 28:04.402
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

28:05.600 --> 28:07.329
Wow! Thank you!

28:07.400 --> 28:09.368
Scarlet! Scarlet!

28:09.440 --> 28:11.681
Thank you so much!

28:12.440 --> 28:14.886
Okay.

28:15.640 --> 28:16.926
Ah.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.844
When I started out,
people said a woman

28:19.920 --> 28:22.890
could never rob
a bank as well as a man!

28:25.240 --> 28:27.368
Well, times change!

28:27.440 --> 28:29.920
I love you, Scarlet!

28:30.000 --> 28:32.765
Look at all those
faces out there!

28:32.840 --> 28:35.047
We are all so different!

28:35.120 --> 28:36.963
But we have one
thing in common.

28:37.480 --> 28:40.290
We were born with flippers!

28:41.760 --> 28:45.207
No? Just me? Okay.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.764
We have big dreams!

28:48.840 --> 28:51.446
And we will do anything
to make them come true!

28:51.680 --> 28:54.570
Have any of you ever dreamt

28:54.640 --> 28:58.850
of working for the greatest
super-villain of all time?

28:59.480 --> 29:00.480
Yeah!

29:00.520 --> 29:01.567
Whoo-hoo!

29:03.280 --> 29:06.250
Well, what if
I were to tell you

29:06.320 --> 29:09.881
that I am looking
for new henchmen?

29:10.120 --> 29:12.168
Hey, boss! Boss!

29:13.320 --> 29:16.608
I truly believe
somewhere out there

29:16.680 --> 29:20.651
is a villain with the potential
to serve greatness!

29:20.720 --> 29:23.451
And it could be any of you.

29:23.600 --> 29:24.681
Whoa!

29:24.760 --> 29:26.842
Although,
let's not kid ourselves.

29:26.920 --> 29:31.608
Truly,
the only men for this job
are Kevin and his Minions!

29:31.680 --> 29:33.682
- Huh? But... But...
- Ten times the evil

29:33.760 --> 29:36.969
in half the package!
I am just in awe!

29:37.040 --> 29:38.963
Let's hear it for Kevin.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.691
He saved his tribe!

29:41.800 --> 29:44.041
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!

29:46.000 --> 29:48.367
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin...
Hey! Kevin. Hey. Hey!

29:48.440 --> 29:50.647
Argh!

29:52.120 --> 29:55.203
So, how should we
do this? Hmm.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.121
Oh.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.601
You see this
tiny little trinket?

30:00.160 --> 30:02.320
Well, just take it from my
hand and you've got the job.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.886
No big deal,
it's almost too simple.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.241
Uh...

30:06.320 --> 30:07.810
Oh, come on!
Don't be afraid.

30:07.880 --> 30:11.248
Just take the stone
and get that job! Come on!

30:11.320 --> 30:12.321
Oh, okay.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.129
...Boss!

30:14.200 --> 30:15.440
That job is mine!

30:15.520 --> 30:16.567
Ooh!

30:23.680 --> 30:24.886
Now go easy on me.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.769
Whoops!

30:29.280 --> 30:31.203
Love the costume!

30:31.400 --> 30:32.401
Ha!

30:32.960 --> 30:33.961
Uh...

30:35.600 --> 30:36.886
So cool!

30:41.640 --> 30:42.641
Tim? Tim!

30:45.840 --> 30:46.887
Uh...

30:46.960 --> 30:48.883
Oh, no, Bob!

30:48.960 --> 30:51.247
Ah! Tim! Tim!

30:51.320 --> 30:53.084
Is no one good enough?

30:56.240 --> 30:57.287
Bob!

31:06.680 --> 31:07.966
I got it! I got it!

31:15.920 --> 31:17.206
Ah!

31:17.600 --> 31:20.365
Didn't my speech inspire anyone

31:20.480 --> 31:23.211
to rise up and
prove themselves worthy?

31:23.840 --> 31:27.606
All these villains and
yet I still have the bear.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.967
Stuffed bear!
Why am I holding a bear?

31:30.040 --> 31:31.929
Who has the ruby?

31:39.360 --> 31:41.010
Wow! Who...

31:41.040 --> 31:45.841
Who are you,
my knights in shining denim?

31:45.920 --> 31:48.651
...Stuart.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.171
...Bob.
Minions!

31:50.240 --> 31:52.607
That was incredible!

31:52.720 --> 31:55.371
Behold! The last
creatures you'd expect

31:55.480 --> 31:58.165
to win the day have emerged victorious!

31:59.000 --> 32:03.608
Everyone, meet my new henchmen.
The Minions!

32:03.680 --> 32:07.048
Kumbaya! Kumbaya! Kumbaya!

32:07.760 --> 32:09.205
Kumbaya!

32:10.320 --> 32:14.450
Hey!
I know those guys!
I gave them a ride here!

32:14.520 --> 32:16.409
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

32:19.160 --> 32:22.846
Buckle up, boys!
Next stop, England.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.523
Oh...

33:20.880 --> 33:22.006
Bello?

33:22.080 --> 33:24.321
Hey, Kevin! Eh?

33:24.760 --> 33:26.649
Boss? In England?

33:26.720 --> 33:27.880
Nah, Boss!

33:41.120 --> 33:43.043
Ah, uh... Bello, Kevin?

33:43.120 --> 33:44.281
...England?

33:44.400 --> 33:46.209
Uh-huh... Boss?

33:46.280 --> 33:48.442
Scarlet Popapil. Ah.

33:58.040 --> 34:01.442
- Bello? Bello!
- Bello?

34:10.480 --> 34:12.244
Oh!
Wow!

34:17.440 --> 34:19.204
Ah!

34:21.800 --> 34:24.280
Here we go! There.

34:24.920 --> 34:27.764
By the way,
I really like your bear.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.083
Herb! My baby!

34:30.159 --> 34:31.650
You know I am!

34:32.199 --> 34:33.246
How'd it go?

34:33.320 --> 34:34.764
Were you evil?

34:34.840 --> 34:36.922
So evil!
Oh!

34:37.000 --> 34:39.400
A little bird
dropped this off today.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.610
It's me,
I'm the "H."

34:45.679 --> 34:48.570
Also, there was no bird.
Also me.

34:48.639 --> 34:52.440
Herb, seriously,
I wanna dig up that William Shakespeare

34:52.520 --> 34:54.806
so he can see
what true writing is.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.085
I love it!

34:56.159 --> 34:58.970
Ah, that works out because I love...

34:59.040 --> 35:01.964
Well, I love... too.

35:02.040 --> 35:03.849
Ah, the love, ah!

35:03.920 --> 35:06.651
Oh! Oh, ah.

35:06.720 --> 35:09.724
Oh, boys,
could you come here, please?

35:09.800 --> 35:15.807
Meet my husband, Herb.
Inventor, super genius, fox.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.128
Herb, these are
the new recruits.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.488
Kevin, Stuart, and that
cute little one is Bob.

35:22.560 --> 35:23.846
Hey, Bello!

35:23.920 --> 35:27.720
Right on!
You guys are crazy
little and way yellow,

35:27.800 --> 35:30.201
And I dig that!

35:33.720 --> 35:34.881
Sweet, man!

35:35.200 --> 35:37.202
Ah, ah.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.890
Whoa!

35:41.960 --> 35:43.724
I know, right?
Ah!

35:43.800 --> 35:46.804
Just a few things I
stole to help fill the void.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.966
Whoa!
...mega ukulele!

35:53.120 --> 35:54.610
Checkin' out my can?

35:54.680 --> 35:56.489
We stole that
because finally someone

35:56.560 --> 35:58.881
expressed my love of
soup in painting form.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.291
Wow!
Ooh!

36:00.360 --> 36:04.046
Okay, listen up!
It is time to get down to business.

36:05.480 --> 36:06.606
Do you know who this is?

36:06.920 --> 36:08.888
Uh...

36:08.960 --> 36:12.601
This is Queen Elizabeth,
ruler of England.

36:13.080 --> 36:17.768
Oh, I love England.
The music, the fashion.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.286
I'm seriously thinking
about overthrowing it someday.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.522
Ooh!

36:22.600 --> 36:26.286
Anyway, this pale
drink of water oversees it all.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.330
I'm her biggest fan,
love her work!

36:29.400 --> 36:32.324
And I really, really,
really want her crown.

36:36.120 --> 36:39.522
Steal me the crown
and all your dreams come true.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.967
Respect! Power!

36:42.040 --> 36:43.280
Banana!

36:43.960 --> 36:45.450
Banana!

36:45.520 --> 36:46.646
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

36:54.120 --> 36:55.804
Ha!

36:55.880 --> 36:58.406
Henry!

37:01.120 --> 37:02.610
...England. Uh...

37:04.480 --> 37:06.482
...England...

37:31.560 --> 37:32.561
Oh, uh...

37:32.880 --> 37:34.325
Hmm.

37:34.400 --> 37:35.606
Heh.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.842
- Wow!
- Whoa.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.605
Ooh-la-la.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.444
No!
Oh, no.

37:41.520 --> 37:42.885
Don't get too close, boys.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.803
When it's completed,
it'll be my ultimate weapon.

37:44.880 --> 37:49.363
But right now, it's leaking radiation
like you would not believe!

37:51.440 --> 37:54.125
So, you're here for gear.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.120
Whoa!

37:58.400 --> 38:00.528
Bob, Robert, Bobby, my boy.

38:00.640 --> 38:05.043
You get my far-out stretch suit.

38:06.360 --> 38:07.441
Wow!

38:08.120 --> 38:10.726
Kevin, Kev-bo,
Seventh Kevin,

38:10.800 --> 38:13.883
you are the proud owner
of my lava lamp gun.

38:13.960 --> 38:17.248
Ah?
This baby shoots actual lava!

38:17.920 --> 38:19.046
Ooh!

38:19.160 --> 38:20.764
Pretty cool, right?

38:20.840 --> 38:25.607
And finally, Stu. Stu-art,
Stu-perman, Beef Stu.

38:25.680 --> 38:28.570
I got you the coolest invention,
probably ever.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.210
Oh.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.248
Hypno-hat!
Uh, oh.

38:32.680 --> 38:33.681
Uh...

38:38.640 --> 38:42.326
You can use it to
hypnotize anyone. Anyone!

38:42.560 --> 38:45.325
Oh, you look so great!

38:45.400 --> 38:47.289
I feel like a proud mama
with three

38:47.360 --> 38:49.362
dashing evil sons.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.603
Uh, Scarlet, Scarlet...

38:52.680 --> 38:55.411
No, no. Don't say anything.
I won't understand.

38:55.520 --> 38:59.445
It's getting late.
You've had a big day,
you must be exhausted!

39:00.160 --> 39:02.686
Boing, boing, boing,
boing, boing...

39:03.680 --> 39:05.921
Wow! These cats
are pumped!

39:06.000 --> 39:10.164
Well, maybe I'll settle them down
with a bedtime story?

39:10.240 --> 39:12.322
Ha-ha!

39:15.200 --> 39:18.682
How does that sound, Bob?
Bob. Bob! Bob!

39:18.760 --> 39:20.569
Oh! Bedtime porry?

39:20.640 --> 39:23.928
That is a groovy idea!
I'll go get some cookies and warm milk.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.924
This is gonna be so fun!

39:28.000 --> 39:29.286
...bedtime porry.

39:29.360 --> 39:33.809
Oh, yes, I've got a really,
really good bedtime porry.

39:34.280 --> 39:38.729
Once upon a time,
there were three little pigs.

39:39.920 --> 39:44.926
<i>One fateful day, the pigs
encountered a big, bad wolf...</i>

39:46.720 --> 39:49.405
<i>...who had a wonderful
surprise for them!</i>

39:49.480 --> 39:52.609
<i>The wolf offered the three
piggies and all their friends</i>

39:52.680 --> 39:54.523
<i>a job working for her.</i>

39:54.600 --> 39:57.365
<i>Everyone would be so happy!</i>

39:58.200 --> 39:59.725
<i>All the three
little piggies had to do</i>

39:59.800 --> 40:01.723
<i>was just steal one little crown</i>

40:01.800 --> 40:03.484
<i>that the beautiful wolf
had wanted</i>

40:03.560 --> 40:07.531
<i>ever since she was
a penniless little street cub,</i>

40:07.600 --> 40:10.649
<i>unloved and abandoned.</i>

40:11.320 --> 40:14.847
<i>But that crown would mean
she was a princess,</i>

40:14.920 --> 40:17.082
<i>and everybody loves a princess!</i>

40:17.160 --> 40:19.640
<i>So the wolf sent the piggies
to get that crown.</i>

40:21.920 --> 40:24.082
<i>But the little pigs
weren't up to the challenge.</i>

40:24.160 --> 40:26.003
<i>They failed their mission.</i>

40:26.720 --> 40:32.124
<i>So the wolf huffed and puffed,
and she blew them off the face of the earth!</i>

40:34.480 --> 40:35.481
Yo, po, po!

40:39.080 --> 40:40.286
The end.

40:44.320 --> 40:47.642
Good luck getting
that crown tomorrow, little piggies.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.121
I know you won't disappoint me.

40:52.840 --> 40:53.841
Um.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.040
Okay.

41:08.120 --> 41:11.090
...Scarlet.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.844
Which way is the loo, please?
Hmm.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.001
Oh, thank you.
Ah.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.925
Bello.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.764
- Uh...
- ...please.

41:19.840 --> 41:24.164
You're not allowed in without an adult.
Scram, hooligans!

41:24.240 --> 41:25.651
Oh.

41:25.720 --> 41:28.929
Uh, mm.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.291
Ooh...

41:34.400 --> 41:36.084
Oh, la...

41:36.400 --> 41:37.686
Stuart...

41:42.320 --> 41:43.924
How many tickets, please?

41:45.280 --> 41:46.520
...please.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.171
...please.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.525
Enjoy yourself, love.

41:57.600 --> 41:58.965
Thank you!

42:01.960 --> 42:04.531
It was nowhere near Hyde Park!

42:04.600 --> 42:05.840
Bob's your uncle.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.605
Huh, hmm.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.569
Okay.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.730
Okay.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.529
Huh? Ah!

42:21.280 --> 42:22.964
He-hey.

42:23.320 --> 42:24.651
Okay.

42:24.720 --> 42:25.721
Hey!

42:25.800 --> 42:27.723
What are you doing here?

42:29.560 --> 42:33.042
This is a restricted area!
Hands in the air!

42:33.120 --> 42:34.770
No...

42:40.400 --> 42:41.640
Stop that!

42:44.720 --> 42:46.609
Get back.

43:07.200 --> 43:08.201
Yay!

43:11.280 --> 43:13.009
Ah!

43:21.760 --> 43:23.762
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

43:23.840 --> 43:25.604
Bob, Stuart...

44:03.680 --> 44:05.045
So...

44:05.160 --> 44:09.324
So, you came for
the Queen's crown, did you?

44:09.400 --> 44:12.529
Well, you're gonna
have to get through me!

44:12.600 --> 44:15.206
The Keeper of the Crown!

44:19.240 --> 44:21.242
Ow! Hey!

44:21.320 --> 44:24.130
You think it's
funny to mock the elderly, do you?

44:24.200 --> 44:25.200
Uh...

44:26.360 --> 44:28.601
I've been up here for decades,

44:28.680 --> 44:30.728
just waiting for someone to try

44:30.800 --> 44:32.768
and steal the Queen's treasure!

44:34.400 --> 44:35.970
Okay.

44:37.920 --> 44:40.127
What are you saying?
Never mind, don't care!

44:44.760 --> 44:46.285
Oh, no!

44:46.360 --> 44:48.806
Oh, no, you don't!

44:50.440 --> 44:51.930
Oh, flippin' heck!

44:54.600 --> 44:55.681
What's goin' on?

45:01.480 --> 45:02.720
Bob...

45:02.800 --> 45:05.531
Eh... Hmm.
Wow.

45:33.680 --> 45:35.045
Hello!

45:40.160 --> 45:42.128
Huh?

45:55.360 --> 45:56.521
Hello!

45:57.080 --> 45:58.127
Stone the crows!

45:58.200 --> 45:59.201
Stop him, lads!
Wait!

45:59.280 --> 46:00.611
Go for the legs!

46:05.960 --> 46:07.166
Gordon Bennett!

46:07.240 --> 46:08.685
Kevin!

46:14.640 --> 46:16.563
The Queen's
been kidnapped, Sarge!

46:16.640 --> 46:17.687
Blimey!

46:23.280 --> 46:24.327
Hyah! Hyah!

46:24.400 --> 46:25.401
Ooh!

46:33.160 --> 46:34.969
Ha! Boo-ya!

46:40.040 --> 46:42.008
Huh. Hyah! Hyah!

46:42.080 --> 46:44.321
What's going on?
Bello!

46:44.400 --> 46:45.481
Oh, my goodness!

46:46.920 --> 46:48.001
- Whoa!
- Ha-ha!

46:48.080 --> 46:49.161
No!

46:50.880 --> 46:55.249
Gentlemen do not
steal ladies' crowns!

46:56.760 --> 46:57.966
Huh? Hmm?

47:06.080 --> 47:07.570
Huh?

47:12.400 --> 47:13.845
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

47:18.760 --> 47:19.841
Oh, dear!

47:26.480 --> 47:27.766
Ah! Ahhh!

47:32.720 --> 47:34.006
Yeah!

47:34.120 --> 47:36.521
You scoundrel!
After them! Uh-oh.

47:40.840 --> 47:42.001
Stop the blighter!

47:43.880 --> 47:45.848
Go on, grab him!

47:46.440 --> 47:47.441
Huh?

47:53.040 --> 47:54.280
Huh? Oh.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.451
Cor, blimey!

48:04.560 --> 48:07.643
One of England's most famous
myths has become a reality

48:08.520 --> 48:10.727
as a new king has been crowned.

48:10.800 --> 48:14.009
Bob, who appears to be
a bald, jaundiced child,

48:14.120 --> 48:16.487
has pulled the famed sword
right from its stone,

48:16.560 --> 48:19.291
<i>which, legend dictates,
makes him the new king.</i>

48:19.360 --> 48:22.364
Tiny yellow traitor!

48:36.200 --> 48:38.282
England!

48:38.360 --> 48:40.283
England! England!

48:40.400 --> 48:42.721
England!
England! England!

48:42.800 --> 48:45.644
England! England...

48:51.520 --> 48:53.921
Ha, ha!

49:12.840 --> 49:14.205
Bello!

49:14.520 --> 49:15.521
Bello!

49:15.720 --> 49:16.801
Cut!

49:27.920 --> 49:30.002
Hey, Bob.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.443
- Hello, King Bob.
- Uh...

49:39.520 --> 49:42.091
Welcome to Buckingham Palace.

49:42.160 --> 49:43.286
Uh, no.

49:43.880 --> 49:46.121
Oh, what's the matter,
Your Majesty?

49:46.200 --> 49:48.282
Whatever's bothering you,
we can make it right.

49:48.360 --> 49:49.521
Just name it!

49:49.600 --> 49:50.601
Oh.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.689
Buddies!

49:54.360 --> 49:56.886
Buddies! Buddies!

49:58.200 --> 50:00.202
Buddies!

50:03.040 --> 50:04.485
Oh.

50:13.480 --> 50:15.050
Uh...

50:18.440 --> 50:20.010
King Bob!

50:21.720 --> 50:22.846
Long live the king!

50:22.920 --> 50:24.843
King Bob!

50:29.720 --> 50:31.131
...Bob...
...King...

50:44.560 --> 50:46.483
So...

51:01.000 --> 51:02.001
King Bob!

51:10.040 --> 51:12.486
Oh... Yeah!

51:13.480 --> 51:15.005
King Bob! Wait!

51:16.480 --> 51:18.323
- Wow!
- Whoa!

51:20.000 --> 51:21.331
Whoo-hoo!

51:24.320 --> 51:25.367
Oh...

51:25.440 --> 51:26.441
Yee-haw!

51:26.560 --> 51:27.641
King Bob!

51:27.960 --> 51:28.960
Hyah!

51:36.880 --> 51:38.848
Hmm? Huh! Ah!

51:45.680 --> 51:47.682
Yes, King Bob. Oh.

51:49.960 --> 51:50.961
King Bob?

51:51.720 --> 51:52.926
King Bob?

51:53.040 --> 51:54.326
Ah, Claire.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.811
Mmm, Tiffany.

51:56.200 --> 51:58.202
Rawr!

52:04.960 --> 52:06.485
Ball!

52:07.200 --> 52:09.248
How dare you!

52:16.160 --> 52:17.366
Scarlet!

52:17.440 --> 52:21.206
Don't you "Scarlet" me,
you backstabbing little traitors!

52:21.280 --> 52:24.045
Using Herb's invention
to steal my crown?

52:26.360 --> 52:28.647
I feel used.
Not gonna lie.

52:28.720 --> 52:34.489
You stole my dream!
I was going to conquer England someday!

52:34.560 --> 52:36.483
There was gonna be a coronation,

52:36.560 --> 52:39.086
and I was going
to be made Queen.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.003
Every moment was planned.

52:41.080 --> 52:44.448
I'd wear a dress so sparkly,
it glowed!

52:44.520 --> 52:48.809
And everyone who ever
doubted me would be watching,

52:48.880 --> 52:51.724
and they would be crying!

52:51.800 --> 52:55.441
I was going to be
the picture of elegance and class!

52:55.520 --> 52:58.205
And you pinheads screwed it up!

52:58.320 --> 53:00.129
No, no, no!

53:02.040 --> 53:05.681
No, no, no, King Bob!
You cannot just abdicate the throne!

53:05.760 --> 53:07.444
Who invited the square?

53:07.520 --> 53:11.206
And you definitely cannot just
give the job to this woman!

53:11.280 --> 53:12.645
There are laws!

53:12.800 --> 53:14.802
Boss.
...Boss.

53:19.200 --> 53:21.407
...Scarlet Popapil!

53:21.520 --> 53:24.091
King Bob has officially changed the law,

53:24.160 --> 53:25.889
Clearing the way
for Scarlet Overkill

53:25.960 --> 53:27.849
to be crowned Queen of England!

53:27.920 --> 53:31.242
She will be coronated
at London's historic Westminster Abbey.

53:31.320 --> 53:35.211
If I wasn't so polite,
I'd say this spells certain doom for the country,

53:35.280 --> 53:36.805
if not the world.

53:36.880 --> 53:39.486
But I'm so very polite
that I shall keep my mouth shut.

53:40.640 --> 53:42.961
But, seriously,
we're all in big trouble.

53:43.040 --> 53:44.769
Scarlet! Scarlet!

53:45.760 --> 53:48.240
I don't have time
to answer any questions.

53:48.320 --> 53:49.970
I just want to
thank the Minions

53:50.120 --> 53:53.329
for going above and
beyond the call of duty.

53:53.400 --> 53:56.404
You are three tiny, golden...

53:56.480 --> 53:58.960
...pill shaped
miracle workers,

53:59.040 --> 54:03.523
and you have stolen
not just England but my heart.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.090
Scarlet, over here!

54:07.560 --> 54:08.925
Pardon me?

54:10.680 --> 54:11.727
Eh?

54:11.800 --> 54:15.930
Wow! So many!
Good for you!

54:16.000 --> 54:17.923
Well, you'll all
get what you deserve.

54:19.120 --> 54:20.884
Serve!
...serve!

54:22.520 --> 54:23.521
Whoo-hoo!

54:47.800 --> 54:48.801
Oh.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.769
Go ahead, go ahead.

54:53.720 --> 54:55.370
Uh...

55:01.440 --> 55:03.363
Uh...

55:03.440 --> 55:06.569
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but I hate you.

55:07.040 --> 55:11.443
I thought I could get over what you did,
but I feel so betrayed.

55:12.320 --> 55:16.484
I think...
Yes, I think we're gonna have to break up.

55:16.560 --> 55:19.040
And it's not you.

55:19.120 --> 55:22.727
Wait, hold on.
It is you. It's 100% you!

55:22.840 --> 55:24.205
No, no.

55:24.280 --> 55:28.649
So get comfortable, Minions.
Get real, real comfortable.

55:28.760 --> 55:31.161
Because this is where
you're going to spend

55:31.240 --> 55:35.245
the rest of your
worthless little lives.

55:37.920 --> 55:40.764
All right!
Let's do this!

55:40.880 --> 55:42.564
Herb!

55:42.640 --> 55:44.768
Who's this handsome "Herb" fella?

55:44.840 --> 55:48.526
No, my name is "Blerb."
I'm a dungeon master.

55:49.240 --> 55:51.561
Prepare for torture,
which I do!

55:53.320 --> 55:57.723
All right, are we comfy?
Doesn't matter! This is torture!

56:01.680 --> 56:03.205
- Huh.
- Oh.

56:04.600 --> 56:07.604
Wow! Harder than I thought.
Next machine!

56:07.840 --> 56:12.562
Oh, welcome to Hang Town!
Population, you!

56:12.680 --> 56:14.284
Oh.

56:18.600 --> 56:19.601
Whoo-hoo!

56:19.680 --> 56:22.126
Cut it out! This is
really unprofessional!

56:22.200 --> 56:24.043
There's no laughing
in the dungeon!

56:24.120 --> 56:26.691
I wanna see tears and
I wanna hear screams,

56:26.760 --> 56:28.922
or I'm gonna get... Wait!

56:29.000 --> 56:31.002
Hey!
Ooh! I've got a groovy idea!

56:31.080 --> 56:32.081
Ah!

56:34.240 --> 56:36.242
Look at this!
Argh!

56:42.680 --> 56:45.650
<i>Hello!
Will the future king, Herb Overkill,</i>

56:45.720 --> 56:48.166
<i>please come upstairs
to prepare for the coronation?</i>

56:48.240 --> 56:50.527
Well, I hope you learned
your lesson for today.

56:52.080 --> 56:56.688
And by the way, it was me,
Herb, the whole time!

56:58.760 --> 57:01.411
I don't even know
anyone named "Blerb"!

57:01.520 --> 57:03.284
Uh, Herb...

57:03.720 --> 57:04.801
Oh. Huh.

57:05.480 --> 57:10.611
I am hours away from becoming
the Queen of England!

57:10.680 --> 57:12.569
I know!
It's a gas!

57:12.640 --> 57:14.563
I will finally get my crown.
Yeah.

57:14.640 --> 57:18.087
It's all I've ever wanted.
I'm going to be so happy.

57:19.240 --> 57:22.483
But let me ask you
something, Fabrice.

57:22.560 --> 57:25.530
Does that look like this to you?

57:27.960 --> 57:33.569
Mrs. Overkill,
the hair in that picture,
it's just two wavy lines!

57:34.360 --> 57:36.408
Oh, so, what,
now you're an art critic?

57:36.480 --> 57:40.883
I drew that when I was five years old!
Get out of my sight!

57:44.680 --> 57:46.125
Bye, Fabrice!

57:46.640 --> 57:48.768
I liked him. He was fun.

57:49.440 --> 57:51.408
So, what do you
think of the dress?

57:51.480 --> 57:57.044
Oh, it's so beautiful.
So fashion-forward.
So Valentino.

57:57.760 --> 58:00.331
Gave it a sweetheart
neckline because you're my sweetheart.

58:00.400 --> 58:02.129
The high collar
and cinched waist

58:02.200 --> 58:04.487
reflect a simpler,
more violent time.

58:04.560 --> 58:08.121
The material is a blend of taffeta
and high-density body armor.

58:08.200 --> 58:09.645
Fully armed and loaded.

58:10.920 --> 58:13.491
And that glow,
that's nuclear.

58:13.560 --> 58:15.608
Nice. Just one more
thing to do.

58:15.720 --> 58:17.722
Gotta look good for the public.

58:17.800 --> 58:18.801
Ugh.

58:19.160 --> 58:20.207
Do you mind?

58:20.280 --> 58:21.281
My pleasure.

58:23.120 --> 58:25.771
Little tighter, sweetie.
Come on, I can take it.

58:26.240 --> 58:28.402
Little tighter.

58:28.480 --> 58:30.448
Tighter!

58:30.520 --> 58:33.205
Must have tiny waist.

58:33.920 --> 58:35.490
Seeing stars, seeing stars!

58:36.640 --> 58:39.450
Losing feeling in my legs. Perfect!
Tie it, tie it, tie it, tie it.

58:42.800 --> 58:43.801
Huh?

58:44.760 --> 58:47.001
Ah. Bob! Stuart!

58:47.080 --> 58:48.320
Eh?

58:57.520 --> 58:59.841
- Ooh! Bello!
- Ooh-ooh!

59:01.760 --> 59:03.808
Ah! Oh.

59:04.280 --> 59:06.044
Ah.

59:09.800 --> 59:11.689
Huh!

59:17.080 --> 59:18.081
Ah.

59:21.520 --> 59:24.410
- Eh, eh, Kevin...
- ...Scarlet.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.650
Ah!

59:31.000 --> 59:33.401
"Porry Scarlet."

59:35.280 --> 59:37.760
- He, he!
- ...Boss.

59:39.120 --> 59:40.121
Oh.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.411
Ah, okay!

59:49.040 --> 59:50.041
Huh?

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.444
I love you, Scarlet!

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.362
Queen wave, queen wave!
Queen waving!

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:21.370
I am so, so excited!
This is perfect!

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.442
Everyone looks so nice!

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.081
Oh! Oh, you are just adorable!

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.927
Oh, yes!

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.570
And that music, oh!

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:36.923
Who is that organist?
She is good! Right?
She looks like an Edna.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.686
Edna, you are very good!
Who was that? Whoa!

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.729
Thanks for doing this,
padre. Big fan.
Uh-huh.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.486
Come here,
let me squeeze you!
Oh, you are so squishy!

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.160
...Scarlet.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.322
Go, go, Go!

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.365
Ouch! Ouch!

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:16.846
<i>...sayonara!</i>

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.571
<i>Ciao...</i>

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.445
Bob...

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.806
Stuart!

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.690
Aww! Oo-ooh!

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.768
Okay!

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.001
Oh! Beh...

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.523
Will you to your power

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.722
cause law and justice...

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.211
...Popapil!

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.441
Oh!
Ah...

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.765
Hmm? Ah...

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.490
Huh? Uh... Uh...

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.409
Stopa!

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.045
Bah!

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.684
In mercy...

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.845
No, no, no!

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.691
Do you, Scarlet Overkill...

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.251
Yeah!

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.805
Huh? Oh?

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.041
No!

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.690
Uh, mmm...

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.720
...Bob.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.562
I proclaim thee,
Scarlet Overkill,

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.842
the Queen of England!
Oh! Huh?

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.447
Kevin!

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.561
Huh?

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.525
Scarlet! Scarlet, my queen?

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.364
Somebody help me!

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.644
Come on, come on!
Lift on two. One, two!

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.725
One, two!

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.811
Huh?

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.810
Scarlet! You're okay!

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.482
He tried to kill me!

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.369
Uh, no...

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:59.163
Villains, this is no longer a coronation!
It is an execution!

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.810
Get them!

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.290
Whoa, Nelly!
Run, fellas, run!

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.689
Come back here, you!

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.281
Ah!

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.329
Uh?

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.041
Hyah!

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.281
Aah!

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.681
You're mine!

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.000
Stuart, Bob! Uh...

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.921
Oops!

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.921
Oh!

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.650
Hey! I got one!

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:37.921
Tim!

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.041
Huh?

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.366
Oh? Aww! Oh!

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.601
Uh? Eh?

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.481
Tim!

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.485
Stuart! Bob!

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.685
Buddies!

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.684
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.091
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.287
Mind the gap!
Mind the gap! Mind the gap!

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.885
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.246
Mind the gap!

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.166
He won't get away!

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.446
He won't escape us!

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.720
Huh?

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.001
What about this one?

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.406
Why did the queen go to the dentist?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.128
To get her teeth crowned.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.441
Heh!

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.727
Tell us another one, Lizzy!

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.801
Uh, uh...

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.450
Bello!
Oh!

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.721
It's you.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.531
Everyone, this is one
of the little fellows

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.171
who stole the monarchy from me.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.686
And how's that
working out for you?

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.922
Uh, Scarlet...

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.810
Oh, yes, yes, I saw what
was going on on the telly.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.006
Uh, telly?

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.849
<i>What was meant to
be the coronation of</i>

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:04.810
<i>Scarlet Overkill has
gone terribly wrong as...</i>

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.041
<i>Move!</i>

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:11.201
<i>Kevin, Kevin,
I know you're out there.</i>

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:15.285
<i>You think you've gotten away?
Well, what do we have here?</i>

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.361
<i>Bello!</i>

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.249
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>
Bob? Stuart?

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.721
<i>Which one shall I kill first?</i>

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.610
<i>Little Bob? Stuart?</i>

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.251
<i>Bob! Stuart!</i>

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:31.169
<i>I will do it, Kevin,
if you are not back here by dawn!</i>

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:32.927
Oh, my!

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.001
No!

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.889
...buddies!

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.246
...Scarlet.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.164
There he is!

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.086
Follow me!

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.601
Ah! Ha-haa!

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.322
Who the man, eh?

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.245
Uh... Oh!

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.566
Oh.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.281
Harder! It's just my head.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.363
Oh, no!

01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:24.805
This way! Let's get him!

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.245
Go, go, go!

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.205
No!

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.399
Huh?

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.640
Oh.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.171
Huh?

01:08:54.439 --> 01:08:56.761
<i>Ultimate weapon initiated.</i>

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:01.163
<i>Activation in three, two, one.</i>

01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:31.930
Bello.

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:38.448
Huh?
...buddies!

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:43.243
This is it, boys!

01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:45.607
Things do not
look good for you.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.290
Oh, and I'm keeping the bear.

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:48.805
Tim!

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.326
You're not gonna need him
where you're going.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:52.606
Heaven.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:59.250
Huh? Uh... Aah!

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.800
Shoosh, shoosh,
shoosh, shoosh! Oh!

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.484
Huh? Ah!

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.731
Bye-bye. Say bye-bye,
Bob. Bye-bye!

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.403
Huh?

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.005
Oh, whoa!

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.762
Wait, what? How did he...

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.922
Hold my bear.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.161
Huh?

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.444
Yippee! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Kevin!

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.805
So, that's your plan?

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.121
Make yourself a bigger target?

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.602
Huh?

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.648
K-K-Kevin? Hey!

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.290
...Kevin!

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400
Whoa!

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.801
Ow!

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.121
And so help me,

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.407
I never wanna
see another one of

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.801
your goofy, bug-eyed
faces ever again!

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.880
Scarlet! Scarlet! Scarlet!
What?

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.447
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.684
Oh no, you don't!

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.441
Whoa!

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.844
And just for the record,
my little deviled eggs,

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.288
you can thank Kevin
for what I'm about to do to you!

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.524
Ow! Ow!

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.603
Bob! Stuart!
Buddies!

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.127
Tony!

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.440
Tom!

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.443
Chris!

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.045
You the man!

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:56.125
Buddies! <i>Mazel tov.</i>

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.806
Ugh! Ew!

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.682
Ooh! Aah! Kevin! Kevin!

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:16.044
Enough! This ends now!

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.084
Kevin!

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.801
You imbecile!
Have fun exploding!

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.006
Baby!

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.246
What's the rush?

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.481
Got to get out of here!

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.445
Let us go!

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.247
No, no, no, no!

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.288
Kevin!

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.286
Kevin...

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.003
Huh?

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.325
Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo!

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.841
Ooh!

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.570
Stuart?
Hmm.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.051
Bob?

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:51.881
Okay.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:12.251
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are here today to celebrate the Minions!

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.488
Huh!

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.841
The country owes you
a great debt of gratitude.

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.686
Bob, you were a wise and
noble king for all of eight hours.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:33.684
So for you,
I offer this tiny crown
for your teddy bear, Tim.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.411
Oh, very good, Bob!

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.442
Oh, spectacular!

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.444
I'm so proud of you boys!

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:49.330
Oh, Stuart.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:54.964
For you,
I have this beautiful,
super-duper, incredible...

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.486
Ah!
...snow globe!

01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.449
Eh? Poglobe?
Uh, ze...

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.808
And look, look,
hours of excitement!

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.931
Oh, uh...

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.810
Yippee.
Uh, eh, <i>gracias.</i>

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:13.524
Stuart, we're just
messing with you!

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.603
Don't be mad at me,
it was Kevin's idea.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.682
Kevin!

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.730
We have a much
better surprise for you!

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:25.411
...super mega ukulele!

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.687
Uh... Wow!

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:01.365
...poglobe.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.680
Thank you.

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.363
Right. Uh...

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.568
And finally, Kevin!

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.007
You are a hero of
the highest order.

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:19.290
For your bravery and valor,
I am knighting you.

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:23.328
From here on out,
you are Sir Kevin.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.486
Well done.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.847
<i>What a beautiful moment!</i>

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.440
Kumbaya!
Kumbaya!

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:45.560
<i>The nation, nay,
the world was celebrating
Kevin, Stuart and Bob.</i>

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.962
<i>The last few thousand years were rough,
no question,</i>

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.647
<i>but things were
finally going their way!</i>

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.970
<i>Kevin had never been more proud.</i>

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.683
<i>But something was missing.</i>

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.925
Yes, good show, good show!

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.600
My crown is gone! It's gone!

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.160
Blimey!

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.043
She's lost the crown!
Oh, my days!

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:14.961
Scarlet?

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:18.442
Scarlet! Hey!

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.602
...Scarlet! Hey!

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:24.480
They took everything from me!
My castle! My reputation!

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.325
Things look bleak,
baby, I'm not gonna lie!

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.609
But now at least
I have my crown!

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.528
Child,
give me that back.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:51.409
No, I don't think so!

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.802
You have no idea who
you're messing with!

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.724
I am the greatest
super-villain of all time!

01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.370
Oh!

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.811
Were you?

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.882
B... B... Buddies...

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.644
Ah!

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:31.969
...Boss! Ha, ha!

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.283
Get back!
Are you really going to
allow that little penguin

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.170
to make off with my crown?

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.480
Herb.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:43.810
I'm done.

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.321
For me?

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.001
Bye-bye!

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.250
Big boss!

01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:03.002
<i>And that is how the Minions
found their new boss.</i>

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:06.607
<i>He was cunning,
he was evil, he was perfect.</i>

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:10.480
<i>He was despicable.</i>

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.727
Huh?

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.640
Banana!
Banana!

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.721
Banana!

01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.840
Banana! Banana! Banana!

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.161
Banana!

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:57.367
Cheese! Cheese! Cheese!

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.685
Gru! Gru! Gru!

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:45.570
Gru!

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.688
Bob...

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.602
Hey! Come back here!

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:45.445
Freeze ray!
