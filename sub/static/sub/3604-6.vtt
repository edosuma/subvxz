00:03.713 --> 00:05.874
You have to tell me
where Mr. Canfield went.

00:05.965 --> 00:07.080
He's not a killer.

00:07.175 --> 00:10.338
I'm not gonna send
anybody to Level 5
who doesn't belong there.

00:10.469 --> 00:13.176
You want me to
kill your partner?
Do it, and lwill let you go.

00:13.264 --> 00:14.970
I won't be a monster.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.300
What's going on?
Claire lied.

00:18.394 --> 00:21.136
There was no cheerleading
retreat. She's obviously
gone after one of them.

00:21.272 --> 00:23.354
SANDRA: Who is he?
MEREDITH:
His name's Eric Doyle.

00:23.441 --> 00:25.306
It's okay, I know him.
I'll go get Claire.

my future future.

I've got to find her.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.696
Are you okay?
ANGELA: Your brother
tried to kill me.

00:36.787 --> 00:39.779
He took Sylar's ability,
and now he's suffering
the consequences.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.328
How do you feel
about recruiting?

00:43.461 --> 00:47.204
Recruiting for what?
An organization for
a new world order.

00:47.965 --> 00:51.048
Your father was disappointed
that you weren't born with
the genetic code.

00:51.135 --> 00:53.421
You did experiments on me
and God knows who else.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.673
I know a scientist.
Anybody can
help you, he can.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.388
Can he be trusted?
Suresh? Yeah,
he's harmless.

inject yourself with that?

You can see the future.
I can't have that.

together nicely.

MOHINDER: In every journey,
the traveler must ask,
"Was the right path taken?"

01:30.341 --> 01:33.174
Many roads are long
and winding,

01:34.512 --> 01:37.003
filled with those
who have lost their way.

01:40.476 --> 01:44.139
Some forge their own course,
guided by faith,

01:45.189 --> 01:48.807
seeking not a location,
but a kindred soul.

01:50.945 --> 01:55.689
Others step together,
finding safety in
the arms of another.

01:58.160 --> 02:03.826
A few remove themselves
from the trail to avoid
the path of temptation.

02:05.459 --> 02:10.624
But those who watch
the track too closely fail
to see where it led them,

02:12.967 --> 02:17.176
and theyâ€™re often
all too surprised
by their destination.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.058

02:26.731 --> 02:29.643
Yeah, he has no powers.
What good is he to us?

02:29.734 --> 02:32.817
You kill him,
you are badass.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.645

04:10.000 --> 04:13.458
Oh, my God!
You actually killed him.

04:14.672 --> 04:16.913
That guy told me to.
Badass!

04:17.007 --> 04:19.965
That was to prove
you wouldn't. You're
supposed to be a good guy.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.634
Now, I'm a villain like you.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.258

No, but you are a thief.

It's not like anybody
gets hurt.

Ando was useless to me.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.769
He had no powers.
Now, take me
to your boss.

04:35.860 --> 04:37.441
I'm not taking you
anywhere.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.863

I don't need
anything from you!

(GRUNTS)

34:54.510 --> 34:55.499
(GRUNTS)

34:57.846 --> 34:59.006
I'm not gonna
let you leave, Peter.

34:59.139 --> 35:01.175
I've been down that path.
It's too dangerous.

35:08.148 --> 35:09.854
You're too weak
to stop me.

35:12.069 --> 35:16.028
I know what
it feels like now,
all this power.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.529
I'm the most special.

35:40.097 --> 35:41.633
I know what
you're thinking.

35:44.393 --> 35:46.884
You didn't mean
for any of this
to happen.

35:48.397 --> 35:53.642
You try to fix it,
but everything you do
just makes it worse.

35:53.736 --> 35:55.442
It all got out of control.

35:55.529 --> 35:59.147
But that girl that was here
gave you a way out.

35:59.241 --> 36:01.152
Some answers.

36:01.243 --> 36:04.201
This was all
so unnecessary.

36:04.288 --> 36:08.406
Maya was right.
I am a monster.

36:08.542 --> 36:10.248
TRACY: Maybe we all are.

36:11.754 --> 36:13.244
I understand.

36:29.897 --> 36:30.886
(SCREAMS)

36:44.119 --> 36:45.529
Nathan, are you okay?

36:45.621 --> 36:46.952
(GROANS SOFTLY)

36:48.749 --> 36:50.114
Come here.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.286
Okay.

37:00.302 --> 37:01.963
We're not finished here.

37:11.146 --> 37:15.230
What, you're not hungry?
Yeah, me neither.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.484
You came back?
Yeah.

37:25.327 --> 37:29.411
I'm supposed to
recruit you to Pinehearst,
but you wouldn't fit in.

37:31.917 --> 37:35.080
It's not you. It's...
I mean, it is you, but...

37:35.170 --> 37:37.912
It's these people
and the things
that they do...

37:39.258 --> 37:43.592
They're not good people,
and you seem like
a really sweet guy, so...

37:43.679 --> 37:47.046
(CHUCKLES)
Great. Okay...
Well, that's...

37:47.141 --> 37:49.052
That's great.
I mean, that means
that you and I should...

37:49.143 --> 37:51.555
That means that
you need to stay
away from them.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.478
Actually,

37:56.942 --> 37:58.853
you have to stay away
from them, too.

37:59.987 --> 38:02.774
In the future,
Pinehearst is gonna

38:04.533 --> 38:06.114
get you killed.

38:07.035 --> 38:10.277
That's why I wanted
to find you, to save you,

38:10.372 --> 38:12.203
to keep that
from happening.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.460
You read minds,
not the future.

38:15.544 --> 38:18.627
I know, I know, but I met
a guy in Africa, and
everything that he paints...

38:18.714 --> 38:19.954
Comes true.
Yes!

38:20.048 --> 38:21.333
So you've gotta
stay with me.

38:21.425 --> 38:23.290
No, you don't get it.

38:23.385 --> 38:25.717
l have to go back.
I don't have a choice.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.920
But you don't trust
these people.

38:28.015 --> 38:30.301
If you can read
my thoughts,
then you know

38:30.392 --> 38:31.723
that I don't know
if I can trust you,
either.

38:31.810 --> 38:35.644
Forget your thoughts.
What is your heart
telling you to do?

38:39.193 --> 38:40.603
Same as it always does.

38:42.321 --> 38:44.061
Keep moving too fast
to get caught.

38:44.156 --> 38:45.987
What do they
have over you?

38:49.495 --> 38:51.235
I can protect you.

38:55.542 --> 38:56.577
No.

38:57.878 --> 38:59.163
You can't.

39:00.923 --> 39:02.208
Bye, Parkman.

39:55.477 --> 40:00.096
You were relying too much
on your powers. You forgot
how to use your head.

40:01.650 --> 40:05.142
But when you started to think,
that's when you found me.

40:05.821 --> 40:07.812
This was a test?

40:07.906 --> 40:09.316
Yes.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.815
And now you are ready.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.832
These are
the villains
you seek.

40:18.917 --> 40:23.502
You can take me to them
or you can follow
your own path.

Mr. Petrelli?
I know,
the bad guys are here.

41:19.603 --> 41:23.721
ARTHUR: That's what
they call you, isn't it?
Criminals, villains...

41:26.401 --> 41:27.857
It's okay.

41:29.237 --> 41:30.738
He's my son.

41:35.744 --> 41:37.735
Dad.
Peter.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.787
How is this possible?
You're dead.

41:43.085 --> 41:45.076
It's a long story.

41:46.588 --> 41:48.749
So you're behind
all this. You...

41:49.758 --> 41:51.248
You hurt Mom?

41:53.053 --> 41:56.090
Like I say,
we need to talk.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.056
Come give
your father a hug.

42:02.604 --> 42:04.060
It's all right, Peter.

42:05.565 --> 42:06.941
It's all right.

42:12.614 --> 42:15.105
(WHISPERING)
I'm sorry it had
to come to this.

42:16.284 --> 42:17.945
(PETER SCREAMING)

42:27.087 --> 42:29.794
You don't have
your powers
anymore, Peter.

42:32.551 --> 42:34.382
Because I have them now.
