CHAPTER ONE: "MAN"

02:48.669 --> 02:49.670
You...

02:50.462 --> 02:52.714
Do you understand what I'm doing?

03:07.771 --> 03:09.106
Be quiet...

03:20.701 --> 03:22.619
Please... help me...

04:53.877 --> 04:54.878
Hey!

05:15.607 --> 05:17.275
Keep still.

05:54.896 --> 05:59.317
Please... don't... please...

06:01.611 --> 06:03.738
Fuck me if that's what you want.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.782
I'll do whatever you want.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.535
I won't say anything about this to anyone.

06:12.747 --> 06:13.915
Do you...

06:14.040 --> 06:16.459
...understand what I'm doing?

06:17.168 --> 06:19.796
I understand that you are strong.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.216
I like a guy like you.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.930
Do you want me?

06:29.139 --> 06:31.182
Yes, I want you to fuck me.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.851
You're a strong guy...

06:33.101 --> 06:34.436
I want it now.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.941
Please come...

06:40.191 --> 06:41.693
...inside me.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.327
L...

06:50.869 --> 06:52.746
I won't come inside you.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.474
What a filthy mouth.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.315
Shut your mouth up.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.428
Fucking bitch.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.267
Nobody...

08:00.063 --> 08:01.648
understands...

12:01.471 --> 12:04.224
How can he do such thing anyway?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.476
I can kinda understand him.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.770
Really? I can't believe that.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.439
Isn't he so creepy?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.358
You think so?

12:13.942 --> 12:16.444
You don't understand a man's heart.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.737
No, I don't.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.738
Yeah?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.490
No. Tell me about it.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.866
Well...

12:22.450 --> 12:24.452
Men are not that strong.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.664
I know that you think men are strong...

12:27.830 --> 12:30.792
...and something that you can lean on.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.460
That's what girls think.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.544
Yes, exactly.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.546
And that's what we want.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.090
But, the truth is...

12:37.173 --> 12:38.424
...totally opposite.

12:38.633 --> 12:39.634
Men are weak.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.887
Even pro wrestlers.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.305
Pro wrestlers?

12:44.389 --> 12:46.557
Boxers, and all those
martial arts fighters...

12:46.557 --> 12:47.558
All of them as well.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.559
What do you mean?

12:48.559 --> 12:51.771
They turn into a kitty-cat
when they're with their girls.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.689
I'm pretty sure.

12:52.689 --> 12:53.898
A kitty-cat...'?

12:53.982 --> 12:57.068
Men are weak, but you all are
expecting us to be strong.

12:57.068 --> 13:00.029
So we keep trying to pretend to be.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.240
Are you saying that I'm making you tired?

13:02.699 --> 13:03.908
Good evening.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.787
Would you like some hot Oden?

13:33.855 --> 13:37.734
HELL

15:13.037 --> 15:16.082
Hey... look at me.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.045
Come on, turn around to me.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.382
What are you watching?

15:30.012 --> 15:32.056
Please don't ignore me.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.445
What's wrong with you?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.447
Why are you watching this?

15:49.740 --> 15:52.118
One of the bitches I killed today...

15:52.535 --> 15:54.454
...asked me to fuck her.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.873
What a nasty bitch.

15:57.081 --> 16:01.711
But she was saved by you.
So she is fine now.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.756
Well... where is she now?

16:07.341 --> 16:09.051
I dumped her.

16:10.928 --> 16:11.929
That's...

16:13.014 --> 16:14.557
...too bad.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.147
Do I really want to fuck'?

16:22.064 --> 16:23.691
Don't even say that.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.110
You know the answer.

16:26.402 --> 16:29.030
Do you forget what you taught us?

16:30.239 --> 16:31.532
What's that?

16:32.033 --> 16:37.788
You taught us how to find
what real love is.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.917
You are the one who guided us.

16:41.959 --> 16:46.756
So we will keep our eyes on only you.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.052
We will love only you.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.141
Right...

16:58.017 --> 17:02.897
You all will love only me.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.690
That's right.

17:05.148 --> 17:06.526
Only you.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.111
Only me...

17:11.196 --> 17:15.284
You must let many more bitches know...

17:15.284 --> 17:16.993
...that you're...

17:20.998 --> 17:22.208
Hey...

17:24.292 --> 17:25.711
I'm what?

17:26.295 --> 17:27.672
Come on.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.715
That I'm what?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.176
Hey! Say it!

17:32.718 --> 17:33.719
Hey!

17:34.470 --> 17:35.846
Answer me!

17:35.846 --> 17:36.847
What am I?

17:36.847 --> 17:38.891
What must I let them know?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.643
Tell me!

18:48.878 --> 18:50.046
L...

18:53.716 --> 18:55.217
What am I?

19:04.226 --> 19:06.687
Do you understand what I'm doing?

19:23.871 --> 19:26.666
Shut up, American bitch.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.018
Don't touch me, fucking freak!

19:50.773 --> 19:52.817
Nobody understands.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.206
I'll fucking kill you!

21:16.442 --> 21:18.194
Do you feel my power?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.419
Do you feel my pain?

23:06.552 --> 23:08.596
Do you feel my anger?

23:14.518 --> 23:16.520
Do you feel me, you fucking bitch?!

23:37.917 --> 23:39.960
Nobody...

23:41.462 --> 23:43.505
understands...

23:51.805 --> 24:00.022
CHAPTER TWO: "WOMAN"

25:32.322 --> 25:34.033
It's OK...

25:35.868 --> 25:38.412
...isn't it?

26:10.319 --> 26:15.157
HELL

27:50.711 --> 27:52.671
Hey hey hey...

27:53.297 --> 27:54.506
Nice.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.384
Aloha, hello there.

27:59.303 --> 28:00.762
Well well...

28:01.430 --> 28:04.057
<i>Just found a cutie at last.</i>

28:04.308 --> 28:06.935
<i>It's so cool to know each other.</i>

28:07.144 --> 28:10.189
<i>I like this fresh feelings.</i>

28:10.189 --> 28:13.525
<i>Allow me to sit here and please listen.</i>

28:13.525 --> 28:15.944
<i>Now I'm getting high now.</i>

28:15.944 --> 28:18.989
<i>You're just my perfect woman.</i>

28:18.989 --> 28:22.117
<i>You're gorgeous even when you look unhappy.</i>

28:22.117 --> 28:25.037
<i>Let's do some love experiments together.</i>

28:26.079 --> 28:28.540
<i>It's a wonderful weekend with you.</i>

28:28.957 --> 28:31.126
You're beautiful, really.

28:31.335 --> 28:36.423
I'm so happy to meet a woman like you.

28:36.673 --> 28:40.219
I wish I could be that scarf.

28:40.427 --> 28:42.137
Wouldn't that be funny?

28:42.638 --> 28:43.639
Well...

28:43.847 --> 28:46.516
I have a motorcycle.

28:46.516 --> 28:49.353
It's cold, so I wore two leather jackets...

28:49.353 --> 28:52.397
...and then my neck
couldn't turn like this.

28:52.397 --> 28:55.108
It was kind of thrilling.

28:55.192 --> 28:58.362
Well, that's my presentation for now...

28:58.362 --> 29:01.198
Whoa whoa whoa...

29:43.532 --> 29:44.574
Rei.

29:45.409 --> 29:49.329
Men and women are totally
different living things.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.247
Yes.

29:50.455 --> 29:55.377
Don't you think they never
understand each other?

29:55.377 --> 29:56.712
Maybe.

29:59.006 --> 30:02.092
So you think it's same for us?

30:02.384 --> 30:05.178
No, no, no. We're alright.

30:05.178 --> 30:07.556
Because I understand you.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.641
Everything about you.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.561
What, really?

30:12.644 --> 30:14.646
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.481
I doubt that.

30:16.606 --> 30:17.441
Yes I do.

30:17.441 --> 30:18.984
- You do?
- Yes.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.653
Well... for instance...

30:21.737 --> 30:23.864
I know what's on your mind now.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.032
Really?

30:25.324 --> 30:27.576
So what am I thinking now?

30:27.868 --> 30:29.578
"It's a little boring conversation."

30:30.162 --> 30:31.163
Correct.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.456
You see?

30:34.458 --> 30:35.625
Told ya.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.627
So then let's talk about something funny.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.004
Yeah, I can do that.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.089
Am I the only one...

30:41.089 --> 30:43.675
...who just wants to say
"Bae Yong Joon" sometimes?

30:43.925 --> 30:44.593
I'm not.

30:44.718 --> 30:45.427
No?

30:45.510 --> 30:46.511
"Bae Yong Joon".

30:48.138 --> 30:49.139
I see.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.041
The ocean is beautiful...

31:16.583 --> 31:18.377
...because it's blue?

31:21.004 --> 31:22.005
What'?

31:24.383 --> 31:25.550
That drink.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.428
It looks like a beautiful ocean.

31:29.179 --> 31:31.306
Oh, this?

31:31.473 --> 31:34.768
What if the ocean wasn't blue...

31:35.102 --> 31:37.604
...red for example...

31:37.604 --> 31:39.940
How would we feel?

31:40.148 --> 31:41.483
Red?

31:41.900 --> 31:46.988
Would we feel relaxed as the blue ocean?

31:47.447 --> 31:51.868
If not, it means we don't feel
relaxed by the ocean itself...

31:52.077 --> 31:56.873
...but its color, I guess.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.006
But...

32:05.674 --> 32:06.842
...if...

32:07.717 --> 32:10.429
...the ocean was red...

32:11.930 --> 32:16.309
...we would be wondering.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.104
About what?

32:21.273 --> 32:23.817
"If the ocean was blue..."

32:24.401 --> 32:26.820
"...how would we feel?"

32:31.032 --> 32:34.786
Actually, I was just wondering
what cocktail you're drinking.

32:35.787 --> 32:36.913
This one?

32:38.290 --> 32:39.416
Wanna try?

32:40.459 --> 32:43.003
No no, you don't have to do that.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.172
But...

32:46.256 --> 32:47.632
If you say so.

32:52.554 --> 32:56.057
Shit, I just did it.

32:56.808 --> 32:57.809
Did what?

32:58.310 --> 33:04.107
I, Ryuhei, just made the first
sin ever in my life...

33:04.608 --> 33:05.692
What'?

33:06.234 --> 33:07.944
...drunk driving.

33:10.697 --> 33:11.948
Actually...

33:12.199 --> 33:14.159
...not the first time.

33:16.953 --> 33:22.959
Thinking about myself,
I've already been evil.

33:24.961 --> 33:28.256
I've betrayed many people...

33:28.673 --> 33:31.801
...made them sad...

33:32.594 --> 33:34.304
...and made them cry.

33:36.306 --> 33:39.518
I've been selfish and...

33:40.393 --> 33:43.313
...lived my life the way I wanted to.

33:44.898 --> 33:46.191
I think...

33:46.983 --> 33:48.985
...everybody's like that.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.780
You think so?

33:52.531 --> 33:53.949
You're like that, too?

33:57.702 --> 34:00.622
After being so selfish...

34:01.206 --> 34:04.042
...everything comes back to me.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.419
That's the life.

34:07.921 --> 34:11.174
Every time, I thought I could
do better than last time...

34:11.341 --> 34:14.928
...but, I lost the energy little by little.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.849
It's strange.

34:21.141 --> 34:22.435
What is?

34:23.728 --> 34:25.772
My words are coming out...

34:26.147 --> 34:27.774
...very naturally.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.485
Aren't you trying to make me the next...

34:30.985 --> 34:33.612
...to cry for you?

34:35.489 --> 34:38.118
I don't know for now.

34:39.661 --> 34:44.791
But I just can't imagine your face crying.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.585
There you go.

34:52.882 --> 34:56.136
I might not succeed this time.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.638
But...

34:59.598 --> 35:01.933
...that's why I feel good.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.018
Maybe.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.521
Hey.

35:06.771 --> 35:07.772
What'?

35:08.648 --> 35:12.235
Let's go somewhere.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.072
What'?

35:16.948 --> 35:18.366
To where?

35:20.035 --> 35:21.620
Somewhere...

35:23.496 --> 35:26.833
...I can completely disappear.

35:30.420 --> 35:31.880
I'm sorry.

35:32.839 --> 35:35.425
I just said something strange, too.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.302
That's OK.

35:38.178 --> 35:39.888
I can understand that.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.349
Hey.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.142
It's the ocean.

35:45.352 --> 35:48.355
It's a great view in the daytime.

35:48.938 --> 35:51.399
But not for now.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.985
It's dark.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.114
The ocean...

35:59.115 --> 36:00.950
It's black.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.724
Are you OK?

36:25.100 --> 36:29.020
I feel... a little strange.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.483
So do I.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.193
Do you?

36:35.694 --> 36:40.699
When I look at you, I feel like
I'm looking at myself.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.911
And I can't be calm.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.170
I don't know what to do.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.259
Take your time.

37:00.510 --> 37:03.012
I want you to accept me.

37:05.432 --> 37:06.975
I think...

37:08.393 --> 37:11.521
...I can do the same for you.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.026
Listen...

37:18.987 --> 37:19.988
I...

37:31.166 --> 37:32.959
...actually...

37:34.043 --> 37:35.462
...actually I'm...

37:40.925 --> 37:42.427
Yes?

37:49.142 --> 37:50.685
Keep going.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.646
Let it all out.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.735
<i>I'll</i> accept it all.

38:03.323 --> 38:05.658
You don't want to have any regrets.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.828
It's all over now.

38:10.079 --> 38:12.415
You've been killing...

38:12.749 --> 38:16.085
...many men so brutally.

38:17.921 --> 38:21.966
There are people who
can't do their business.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.970
You know what that means?

38:39.984 --> 38:41.820
This color...

38:42.487 --> 38:45.031
Beautiful, isn't it?

38:45.824 --> 38:48.535
This pure red...

38:49.244 --> 38:51.454
...is my color.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.752
Yours, too. Right?

39:06.678 --> 39:09.514
I'll set you free.

39:13.059 --> 39:16.437
<i>I'll</i> accept all of you.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.007
So cute...

41:44.293 --> 41:45.837
Everybody's the same.

41:59.559 --> 42:02.228
Painful, isn't it?

42:02.562 --> 42:04.939
It's painful to get fucked.

42:33.134 --> 42:34.802
It's OK...

42:37.722 --> 42:39.223
It's OK...

42:41.434 --> 42:42.977
Right...?

42:44.270 --> 42:46.064
Isn't it?

42:56.199 --> 43:02.789
CHAPTER THREE: "MAN AND WOMAN"

44:12.483 --> 44:15.903
What'? Isn't that great?
That's what I was about to say.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.030
Really? That's awesome.

44:18.030 --> 44:20.575
We must be connected in our souls.

44:21.617 --> 44:24.203
Isn't it creepy a bit?

44:24.203 --> 44:28.708
Don't say like that.
I believe it's a destiny.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.126
You do?

44:30.668 --> 44:33.963
Aren't we just two of a kind?

44:34.046 --> 44:36.090
No, we're meant to be together.

44:36.215 --> 44:38.134
What makes you so sure?

44:38.176 --> 44:39.260
Tell me.

44:39.302 --> 44:40.636
The answer is here.

44:41.095 --> 44:43.472
We just met here. It's our destiny.

44:43.514 --> 44:45.725
Oh, it's that easy?

44:45.725 --> 44:48.144
Believe me, I'm serious.

44:48.978 --> 44:50.605
You know that, right?

44:50.938 --> 44:52.064
"No, you're not."

44:52.190 --> 44:53.191
That's not what she's saying.

44:53.232 --> 44:54.233
"You're so shallow."

44:54.317 --> 44:55.443
"And you're playboy."

44:55.568 --> 44:56.444
PIayboy?

44:56.485 --> 44:57.695
"Yes, you are."

44:58.154 --> 44:59.906
Play... boy...

45:01.908 --> 45:03.201
Do you play with yourself?

51:04.979 --> 51:07.439
Fucking bitch...

51:35.759 --> 51:37.261
Do you...

51:38.512 --> 51:41.181
...understand what I'm doing?

52:28.562 --> 52:29.605
You're...

52:40.991 --> 52:42.076
I'm...

52:45.162 --> 52:46.163
I'm just...

52:52.336 --> 52:53.379
I...

56:43.483 --> 56:44.902
I can't...

56:45.402 --> 56:46.695
...come...

56:47.613 --> 56:49.031
...inside you...

56:52.284 --> 56:53.452
I know.

56:55.662 --> 56:56.663
I'm...

56:57.372 --> 56:58.498
...really...

57:00.667 --> 57:02.294
...wanting to.

57:03.712 --> 57:05.005
It's OK.

57:06.506 --> 57:08.050
Now you are...

57:08.550 --> 57:10.761
...inside me.

57:14.348 --> 57:16.558
I can feel you there.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:35.377
It's OK...

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.759
You will be...

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:47.639
OK...

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.351
It's OK...

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:04.447
Right?

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:07.951
Isn't it?
