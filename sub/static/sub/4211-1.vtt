01:21.732 --> 01:24.633
We moved here about a month ago.

01:24.702 --> 01:27.227
My parents said
it would be better...

01:27.304 --> 01:30.068
for me and my brother Eric.

01:30.141 --> 01:33.599
They always say that
when they want something.

01:33.677 --> 01:36.077
Everything was different.

01:36.147 --> 01:38.445
All the streets
had different names.

01:38.516 --> 01:41.451
All my friends were far away.

01:41.519 --> 01:43.510
I was miserable.

01:43.587 --> 01:46.385
I hated it...

01:46.457 --> 01:50.291
until I met my first friend--
Maurice.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.854
I'll never, ever...

01:54.932 --> 01:56.627
have a friend like him again.

02:48.152 --> 02:49.141
Damn it. I hate this.

02:49.220 --> 02:51.688
You wanted a bigger house,
a fixer-upper.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.586
I wanted something both
of us could do together...

02:53.657 --> 02:54.817
and you're never here.

02:54.892 --> 02:57.383
You think I like commuting
two hours to a job I hate?

02:57.461 --> 02:59.224
I thought things
would be different here.

02:59.296 --> 03:01.025
I thought we'd spend
time together.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.565
You're the one
who stopped working.

03:02.633 --> 03:04.601
You think I like being
a stranger to my kids?

03:04.668 --> 03:06.158
I don't know.

03:06.237 --> 03:07.636
Come on.
I’m not a monster, I’m a man.

03:07.705 --> 03:09.570
I’m not sure
there's a big difference.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.971
Oh, great. Now I’m a monster.

03:11.041 --> 03:14.204
Look, I just wish you'd be here
when you're here.

03:38.469 --> 03:40.198
Hi. My name's Danya Haye...

03:40.271 --> 03:42.466
and welcome to Channel 98
cable access--

03:42.540 --> 03:44.235
All About Chicks.

03:44.308 --> 03:47.209
-Today my guest is Lovey.
-Lonnie.

03:47.278 --> 03:48.302
Oh, sorry, Lonnie. Right.

03:48.379 --> 03:50.540
So, Lonnie, tell me.
Where are you from?

03:50.614 --> 03:55.210
I’m from Fort Lauderdale,
but I’m dying to go to L.A.

03:55.286 --> 03:58.915
Mommy! Mommy!

04:04.428 --> 04:06.259
Mommy!

04:06.330 --> 04:08.890
Mommy, a monster!

04:08.966 --> 04:10.866
A monster! Mommy, Mommy!

04:14.572 --> 04:16.164
Mom, a monster!

04:16.240 --> 04:18.902
Honey, are you all right?

04:18.976 --> 04:22.002
OK. Now, the monster
in your dream--

04:22.079 --> 04:23.637
I was wide awake!

04:23.714 --> 04:26.012
Well, it was probably
just your mommy snoring.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.847
This is no joke, Dad!
There was a real monster!

04:28.919 --> 04:29.886
Really?

04:29.954 --> 04:32.320
Honey, there's no such thing
as monsters.

04:32.389 --> 04:33.651
it ran in from the hall...

04:33.724 --> 04:35.954
grabbed my ankle,
and slid under my bed!

04:36.026 --> 04:37.425
Under the bed?

04:38.963 --> 04:40.555
Under the bed?

04:40.631 --> 04:42.656
Yeah.

04:42.733 --> 04:44.360
No, Dad, don't!

04:50.274 --> 04:51.639
Yuck.

04:53.811 --> 04:54.743
No monsters.

04:54.812 --> 04:55.870
Sick.

04:55.946 --> 04:58.039
I guess all the dust bunnies
scared him away.

04:58.115 --> 04:59.241
Bunny?

04:59.316 --> 05:01.614
No, no.
No bunnies, no monsters.

05:01.685 --> 05:03.050
There is nothing
under your bed.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.553
Now, why don't you just
go to sleep, OK?

05:04.622 --> 05:06.283
Can I have the flashlight?

05:06.357 --> 05:08.450
Sure, honey. Would you get it?

05:08.525 --> 05:13.224
Holly, I thought we--
I’ll get the...

05:13.297 --> 05:15.162
flashlight.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.666
OK. Come on, tuck up.

05:20.371 --> 05:21.668
You know,
I bet those monsters...

05:21.739 --> 05:23.730
are more afraid of you
than you are of them.

05:23.807 --> 05:25.274
I know.

05:25.342 --> 05:27.435
Once you realize
they don't exist...

05:27.511 --> 05:29.069
poof. They disappear.

05:29.146 --> 05:32.172
Now, that's a lot of power.

05:40.491 --> 05:41.685
Glen...

05:46.463 --> 05:48.795
Don't burn up
the batteries, OK?

05:48.866 --> 05:49.992
I won't.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.329
Good night, sweetheart.

05:51.402 --> 05:52.334
All right, have a good sleep.

05:52.403 --> 05:53.563
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

05:53.637 --> 05:55.832
Good night, honey.

05:59.677 --> 06:01.508
You think he heard us?

06:01.578 --> 06:04.741
Of course he heard us.
That's what scared him.

06:38.082 --> 06:39.811
Eric, did you take
your vitamins?

06:39.883 --> 06:42.852
-Yes.
-Good boy.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.787
OK, no trading
for Twinkies today.

06:45.856 --> 06:50.520
Come on, Mom.
I don't do that.

06:54.798 --> 06:57.528
Did you carry it over the lawn?

06:57.601 --> 06:59.125
-Good morning.
-Hey, Mom.

06:59.203 --> 07:00.363
Hi, honey.

07:00.437 --> 07:01.563
Hey, Eric.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.469
Hope whatever you watched
on TV last night...

07:03.540 --> 07:05.906
was worth your allowance
and two weeks of TV.

07:07.444 --> 07:09.275
We found the sandwich, Brian.

07:10.781 --> 07:12.078
What sandwich?

07:12.149 --> 07:13.776
Brian Arthur Stevenson...

07:13.851 --> 07:15.318
you are the only person
in this family...

07:15.385 --> 07:17.853
who eats peanut butter
and onion sandwiches.

07:17.921 --> 07:19.479
You think every time
you get caught...

07:19.556 --> 07:21.990
you can just
lie your way out of it?

07:23.227 --> 07:26.128
Damn. Damn it!

07:26.196 --> 07:27.493
The plumber's coming next week.

07:27.564 --> 07:30.328
Great. I can leave him
all these dishes.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.892
Just keep telling yourself--
it's our dream house.

07:33.971 --> 07:35.768
it’s our dream house.
it’s our dream house.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.781
You're dead, mister.

07:55.859 --> 07:59.727
-Hey, I didn't do anything.
-Just like the sandwich?

07:59.797 --> 08:01.389
All right, all right.
Fine. I admit it.

08:01.465 --> 08:05.094
I did have a sandwich, but
I did not have any ice cream.

08:05.169 --> 08:07.797
Why do you always blame
everything on me?

08:07.871 --> 08:10.362
Somebody put scuff marks on
the door kicking them open...

08:10.440 --> 08:12.806
and somebody puts gum
under the table.

08:12.876 --> 08:15.003
Brian, you are old enough
to know the difference...

08:15.078 --> 08:17.103
between right and wrong.

08:17.181 --> 08:20.412
Why don't you start acting it?

08:20.484 --> 08:21.917
Why don't you start acting it?

08:21.985 --> 08:23.247
Dad.

08:32.162 --> 08:34.187
Aw, look at it this way.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.198
They can only get better.

08:36.265 --> 08:40.259
Great. Then can I stay home
from school?

08:42.139 --> 08:43.731
Are you sorry we moved?

08:43.807 --> 08:46.173
I hate it here.

08:46.243 --> 08:48.541
Guess you miss
your friends, huh?

08:48.612 --> 08:51.672
Mom, it's killing me.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.716
You know,
the realtor Mr. Coleman...

08:53.784 --> 08:54.773
he had a kid about your age.

08:54.852 --> 08:56.547
Ronnie Coleman's a toad.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.451
Well, he seemed
like a nice kid to me.

08:58.522 --> 09:02.822
Great. Then you can invite him
over for milk and dead flies.

09:02.893 --> 09:05.327
I would, but your father
ate 'em all.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.397
Brian!

09:21.678 --> 09:24.010
My bike! You ran over it!

09:24.081 --> 09:25.742
My car.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.716
Whose fault is this, Brian?

09:27.784 --> 09:29.376
No way.

09:29.453 --> 09:31.853
I parked it right over there!
Right there!

09:31.922 --> 09:33.355
Right, so before
I got in the car...

09:33.423 --> 09:35.050
I went around and put
the bike there myself?

09:35.125 --> 09:37.992
Forget it, Charlie.
First my shirt, now this.

09:38.061 --> 09:39.528
I’m fifteen minutes late here!

09:39.596 --> 09:41.291
What do you expect me
to do with my bike?

09:41.365 --> 09:43.060
Look at it. it’s destroyed.

09:43.133 --> 09:45.693
Well, you're gonna have
to learn to ride it like that.

09:45.769 --> 09:47.361
You're grounded for two weeks.

09:47.437 --> 09:50.201
No TV for three, and you can
forget about your allowance...

09:50.274 --> 09:51.206
until that car is paid up.

09:51.275 --> 09:52.469
Glen, isn't that
a little rough?

09:52.542 --> 09:54.009
Holly, don't make me
the villain here.

09:54.077 --> 09:57.103
So, Dad, you mean to tell me
that my bike is ruined...

09:57.180 --> 09:58.477
and your car has
a little dent in it--

09:58.548 --> 10:01.381
I’m being punished?
That's not fair!

10:01.451 --> 10:03.783
Somebody put it there, Brian.

10:04.955 --> 10:06.946
And it didn't slime you.
You sure?

10:07.024 --> 10:10.289
Sure, I’m sure. I think
I’d know if I was slimed.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.191
And it didn't go
into the closet?

10:12.262 --> 10:14.787
You know, like,
to rip something off?

10:14.865 --> 10:16.196
No.

10:16.266 --> 10:17.699
What about your desk?

10:17.768 --> 10:20.066
it didn't do your geography
homework, did it?

10:20.137 --> 10:23.766
Look, Todd, I never would've
told you about this, but--

10:23.840 --> 10:25.273
OK, all right.

10:25.342 --> 10:28.038
So, this is an exclusively
under-the-bed phenomenon...

10:28.111 --> 10:29.339
we're dealing with here.

10:29.413 --> 10:33.110
That's right--
exclusively under my bed.

10:36.820 --> 10:38.754
it really was a monster.

10:38.822 --> 10:40.517
Really? What did it look like?

10:40.590 --> 10:42.581
I don't know.

10:42.659 --> 10:44.058
-Hi, Kiersten.
-Hi, Kiersten.

10:44.127 --> 10:46.721
Hi.

10:54.938 --> 10:55.870
Slow down!

10:55.939 --> 10:57.099
Eric, Toad.

10:57.174 --> 10:58.698
Why aren't you
riding your bike?

10:58.775 --> 11:00.538
What bike? Dad ran over it...

11:00.610 --> 11:02.441
because you left it
in the driveway.

11:02.512 --> 11:05.811
No way. Your bike? No way!

11:05.882 --> 11:07.281
Look, I put it away.

11:07.351 --> 11:11.117
Mom and Dad wouldn't touch it,
so that only leaves you.

11:11.188 --> 11:14.282
I didn't touch your bike.
I can hardly reach the pedals.

11:14.358 --> 11:17.122
All right, that's it.
You lie to me, you starve.

11:17.194 --> 11:18.627
My lunch!

11:18.695 --> 11:20.788
You jerk!
I didn't do anything!

11:20.864 --> 11:23.059
Oh, yeah, right.
And what about that ice cream?

11:23.133 --> 11:24.862
You snuck some ice cream
last night, too, didn't you?

11:24.935 --> 11:26.994
Forget it.
Don't blame it on me.

11:27.070 --> 11:28.367
The monster.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.963
That's it.
That's what it was doing.

11:31.041 --> 11:32.770
There are no monsters.

11:34.244 --> 11:36.007
Who's Eric?

11:37.547 --> 11:41.984
Who's the Eric
who threw his lunch at me?

11:42.052 --> 11:44.282
He did.

11:44.354 --> 11:46.447
You Eric?

11:46.523 --> 11:50.220
You want this back?

11:51.428 --> 11:52.986
Sit down back there!

11:53.063 --> 11:55.623
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

11:55.699 --> 11:57.360
Like Bigfoot.

11:58.969 --> 12:01.802
Maybe I will.

12:05.542 --> 12:07.772
Get back in your seats...

12:07.844 --> 12:10.244
or I’ll destroy
every one of you!

12:10.313 --> 12:11.940
You're dead meat, Stevenson!

12:22.025 --> 12:24.721
Stevenson! if it's
the last thing I do today...

12:24.795 --> 12:26.228
I’m gonna make you
eat this shirt.

12:26.296 --> 12:27.228
Fight! Fight!

12:27.297 --> 12:31.791
Listen, Coleman, I’m surprised
you haven't eaten it already.

12:31.868 --> 12:34.063
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

12:35.872 --> 12:38.807
it’s the principal!

12:38.875 --> 12:40.968
Cool it, man!

12:41.044 --> 12:42.511
Cool it, guys!

12:42.579 --> 12:46.675
Break it up! Break it up!

12:46.750 --> 12:48.843
What is going on here?

12:48.919 --> 12:50.910
Sir, I was just
showing Brian...

12:50.987 --> 12:53.649
what he did to my shirt,
and he pushed me away.

12:53.723 --> 12:55.486
Come on--

12:55.559 --> 12:57.993
Stevenson, you're new here,
aren't you?

12:58.061 --> 12:59.255
Yes, sir.

12:59.329 --> 13:02.127
Well, I think we'd better have
a little talk in my office.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.326
You have rules to learn.

13:04.401 --> 13:05.663
Toodles, Bri.

13:25.622 --> 13:28.182
There's enough power in here
to light up Yankee Stadium.

13:28.258 --> 13:32.217
-Already out on parole?
-Very funny.

13:41.438 --> 13:43.269
So, what's up, Miss Deveaux?

13:43.340 --> 13:45.240
You really want to know,
or are you just asking?

13:45.308 --> 13:47.299
I really want to know.

13:50.380 --> 13:52.746
Disgusting. Your face
may corrode the camera.

13:55.986 --> 13:57.044
This is cool.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.088
Don't touch. it’s fragile.

13:59.156 --> 14:00.817
it’s a night blooming cactus.

14:00.891 --> 14:03.018
I want to see
if artificial sunlight...

14:03.093 --> 14:04.822
changes its normal
blooming pattern.

14:04.895 --> 14:07.090
I’m training it to bloom
in the daytime.

14:07.164 --> 14:11.328
To be scientific, I document
the results with Polaroids.

14:14.404 --> 14:16.395
Hey, you know what?

14:16.473 --> 14:21.035
if you mounted the camera in
one spot, like, upside-down...

14:21.111 --> 14:23.102
you could take a whole
bunch of pictures...

14:23.180 --> 14:26.877
and make them into,
you know, like a movie.

14:28.585 --> 14:30.280
Here, look.

14:32.856 --> 14:34.619
Like time-lapse photography.

14:34.691 --> 14:35.953
That's great.

14:36.026 --> 14:38.551
Yeah, so I guess it's all set.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.289
Me and you will team up
on the project.

14:40.363 --> 14:42.490
Forget it, Brian.
I’ll end up doing all the work.

14:42.566 --> 14:44.966
No chance. Find somebody else
to leech off of.

14:45.035 --> 14:48.266
Hey, all right. You know what?
Think about it. Take your time.

14:48.338 --> 14:49.805
You'll probably
change your mind.

15:18.935 --> 15:21.836
Hey, if you say
there's no monster...

15:21.905 --> 15:23.702
then switch rooms with me.

15:23.773 --> 15:24.705
What?

15:24.774 --> 15:26.173
Switch rooms with me.

15:26.243 --> 15:29.644
Yeah. You sleep in Eric's room,
and he sleeps in your room.

15:29.713 --> 15:32.511
You just want my room.

15:32.582 --> 15:36.018
I want you to prove me wrong.
I dare you to switch rooms.

15:36.086 --> 15:38.748
-Double dare him.
-Relax, Toad.

15:38.822 --> 15:41.313
I double dare you
to switch rooms.

15:41.391 --> 15:44.258
-Will you guys take a hike?
-I’ll pay you.

15:45.629 --> 15:46.789
Hey, Toad.

15:46.863 --> 15:50.196
Brian, you gotta stay
the whole night...

15:50.267 --> 15:52.030
and you gotta sleep
with your legs...

15:52.102 --> 15:53.660
sticking out of the covers.

15:53.737 --> 15:56.331
And you have to have
the door closed.

15:56.406 --> 15:58.203
Oh, God, please, stop.

15:58.275 --> 16:01.176
I can't take it.
You're frightening me.

16:01.244 --> 16:02.575
Eric, Todd, it's time for bed.

16:04.180 --> 16:08.241
Hey, you guys,
don't touch anything in my room.

16:09.419 --> 16:10.351
Good night, Dad.

16:10.420 --> 16:11.546
Good night, Mr. Stevenson.

16:11.621 --> 16:13.248
Good night.

16:14.491 --> 16:15.549
Hey, Dad.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.320
Hey, Bri.

16:19.162 --> 16:20.652
You know, I think
it's really nice of you...

16:20.730 --> 16:22.391
to switch rooms
with Eric like this.

16:22.465 --> 16:23.489
I’m proud of you.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.193
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

16:25.268 --> 16:27.395
Personally, I think you guys
are both kind of nuts...

16:27.470 --> 16:30.462
about this monster thing...

16:30.540 --> 16:32.531
but if you happen
to see him tonight...

16:32.609 --> 16:33.598
Yeah?

16:33.677 --> 16:36.339
Could you maybe
get me some autographs?

16:36.413 --> 16:39.041
OK. Yes. OK,
I’ll get you autographs!

16:40.450 --> 16:43.419
So the girl's waiting
for her roommate to get back.

16:43.486 --> 16:45.613
She's getting real scared.

16:45.689 --> 16:49.181
Oh, yeah. The room
is on the second floor.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.692
So she's waiting.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.751
it’s probably
the darkest night ever.

16:52.829 --> 16:57.095
Suddenly from outside,
she hears, ''Thump, thump.

16:57.167 --> 16:59.032
''Thump, thump.''

16:59.102 --> 17:00.729
So she gets real brave.

17:00.804 --> 17:04.296
She inches her way to the door,
and she hears it again...

17:04.374 --> 17:06.637
''Thump, thump. Thump, thump.''

17:06.710 --> 17:09.201
So this girl
is standing by the door...

17:09.279 --> 17:12.442
and the ''Thump, thump''
is getting louder and louder.

17:12.515 --> 17:16.281
So she opens the door,
screams...

17:16.353 --> 17:17.877
but nothing will come out.

17:17.954 --> 17:21.252
She looks out terrified as her
roommate comes up the stairs--

17:21.324 --> 17:23.554
only the ax man cut off
all her arms and legs.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.459
She's dragging herself up
by her chin.

17:26.529 --> 17:29.362
''Thump, thump. Thump, thump.
Thump, thump.''

17:29.432 --> 17:32.299
Phenomenally incredible, huh?

17:32.369 --> 17:35.463
it really happened?

17:35.538 --> 17:36.800
I’m deadly serious, man.

17:36.873 --> 17:38.397
My brother Freddie
told me it happened...

17:38.475 --> 17:39.669
to a friend of a friend...

17:39.743 --> 17:42.007
of a distant cousin
of a cousin of ours.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.471
Hey, Brian.

19:17.540 --> 19:19.440
Hey, Brian, you OK?

19:19.509 --> 19:22.740
Looks like you got two weird
phenomenons in your house--

19:22.812 --> 19:25.713
a monster and a giant chicken.

19:25.782 --> 19:27.773
Double or nothing.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.298
May I be excused?

19:52.375 --> 19:54.309
Yes.

20:16.032 --> 20:18.796
Eric wanted you to have this.

20:20.403 --> 20:22.598
Hi, Mom.

20:22.672 --> 20:24.299
Hi.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.239
Brian, are you all right?

20:28.311 --> 20:30.802
Fine, Mom. Never felt better.

20:30.880 --> 20:35.442
Well, then what are you doing
in bed at 9:15 at night?

20:35.518 --> 20:38.510
School, Mom.
it’s a big day ahead of me.

20:38.588 --> 20:40.385
Big, big day.

20:40.456 --> 20:43.914
Sounds nice, Brian,
but why don't I believe you?

20:43.993 --> 20:45.824
it’s the new me.

20:47.330 --> 20:50.595
OK. Well, I guess
I’ll see the brand new...

20:50.667 --> 20:53.830
all new you in the morning.

20:57.774 --> 20:58.934
Mom?

21:01.477 --> 21:03.707
I love you.

21:05.748 --> 21:07.682
I love you, too, honey.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.581
-Good night.
-Good night.

23:18.281 --> 23:19.942
Yeah.

23:52.682 --> 23:57.312
Dad! A monster.

24:01.524 --> 24:03.355
What are you doing, Brian?

24:03.426 --> 24:05.917
What the hell is going--
look at this mess.

24:05.995 --> 24:08.020
What the hell am I stepping in?
Doritos? Jesus.

24:08.097 --> 24:09.325
I’ll clean them up.

24:09.398 --> 24:11.696
You're damn right, you will.
Get back in that bed, mister.

24:11.768 --> 24:13.429
Dad, wait a minute.

24:13.503 --> 24:16.267
There was a monster here.
You gotta believe me.

24:16.339 --> 24:18.204
A monster?
Brian, it's a pile of clothes.

24:18.274 --> 24:20.401
You're wrestling
a pile of clothes.

24:20.476 --> 24:22.239
What's so funny?

24:22.311 --> 24:24.176
After you finish cleaning
this room tomorrow...

24:24.247 --> 24:27.410
you're gonna
clean out the garage.

24:27.483 --> 24:29.417
And after the garage,
you're gonna cut the hedges.

24:29.485 --> 24:30.782
But it wasn't my fault.

24:30.853 --> 24:32.616
After the hedges,
you're gonna mow the lawn.

24:32.688 --> 24:35.282
-it wasn't my fault.
-Good night.

26:06.716 --> 26:08.206
Boo.

26:08.284 --> 26:10.684
Keep an eye out for monsters.

26:14.056 --> 26:15.717
I’ll scream.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.622
Scream? Good idea.
You know what?

26:17.693 --> 26:19.126
You scream,
your dad's gonna come in here...

26:19.195 --> 26:21.425
with a 1 2-gauge shotgun,
blow your head off.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.761
Actually, I’ll scream.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.164
Shut up!

26:27.403 --> 26:29.598
Great.

26:29.672 --> 26:31.264
Actually, your dad's
gonna come in here...

26:31.340 --> 26:32.773
and find Dorito puke
all over the floor.

26:32.842 --> 26:34.104
What's he gonna say?

26:34.176 --> 26:37.168
Wow! Baseball cards.
I love baseball cards.

26:37.246 --> 26:39.009
Got him, got him,
need him, got him.

26:39.081 --> 26:40.446
Got him, got him,
need him, got him.

26:44.954 --> 26:46.581
A football.

26:46.656 --> 26:48.317
He goes down
the 25-yard line...

26:48.391 --> 26:50.825
the 50-yard line,
the 40-yard line.

26:50.893 --> 26:54.385
Stevenson,
go for the long bomb!

26:54.463 --> 26:57.557
Light! The sun!

26:57.633 --> 26:59.533
Let me go, let me go!

27:23.826 --> 27:25.623
OK. Horns.

27:25.695 --> 27:27.754
Great. Great.

27:27.830 --> 27:29.923
Now nobody's
gonna recognize me.

27:31.767 --> 27:34.099
I got to get under the bed.
I got to go.

27:34.170 --> 27:35.694
No!

27:38.040 --> 27:39.371
What's happening?

27:39.442 --> 27:40.704
I got to get back.
I got to go.

27:40.776 --> 27:42.937
I got to go.
I got--

27:44.113 --> 27:45.978
What's going on?

27:46.048 --> 27:48.243
Bacon and eggs, kid.
What do you want...

27:48.317 --> 27:51.411
sunny side up or over easy?

27:52.822 --> 27:54.084
You're dying.

27:59.996 --> 28:02.021
it’s the sunlight, isn't it?

28:05.401 --> 28:08.461
First it disfigures you,
then it kills you.

28:08.537 --> 28:12.803
Nah. You're mixing me up with
that pansy with the red cape.

28:14.510 --> 28:16.034
Please...

28:17.413 --> 28:22.009
I have to get under the bed...

28:22.084 --> 28:26.646
before the sun totally rises.

28:26.722 --> 28:29.919
No way. You wrecked my bike.

28:29.992 --> 28:32.859
You've been pulling stuff,
trying to get me in trouble.

28:32.928 --> 28:34.691
Brian...

28:34.764 --> 28:38.256
Brian, please.

28:59.455 --> 29:00.717
Damn.

29:35.458 --> 29:39.360
Hey, bud, the name's Maurice,
and I’ll catch you later!

29:57.580 --> 30:00.014
This is ridiculous.
I want my remote.

30:00.082 --> 30:01.242
Where the hell is it?

30:01.317 --> 30:04.775
How am I supposed to watch TV
without the remote?

30:04.854 --> 30:08.017
Have you by any chance seen
a piece of sandpaper...

30:08.090 --> 30:10.422
or a paintbrush around here
the last few days?

30:18.267 --> 30:19.928
Yeah, sure, there was one.

30:20.002 --> 30:22.061
But there are no more, right?

30:22.138 --> 30:24.732
Right. Your room
is monster-free...

30:24.807 --> 30:28.299
so I’ll be taking
my master suite back tonight.

30:33.315 --> 30:36.580
Brian! Eric!

30:37.953 --> 30:42.049
Hey, Bri, Eric, have you guys
seen the remote thing?

30:42.124 --> 30:44.718
I got the Celtics, the Sox,
the Masters are on.

30:44.793 --> 30:48.251
I can't switch it
without the remote.

30:48.330 --> 30:50.594
I didn't take it, Dad.

30:50.666 --> 30:52.793
Well, then where--

30:52.868 --> 30:55.860
God damn this house.

31:15.724 --> 31:18.284
Mom, a monster!

31:21.363 --> 31:25.356
Hey, why did you change rooms
with that wiffle ball?

31:25.434 --> 31:29.302
He's gonna have a heart attack
by the time he's ten.

31:32.575 --> 31:33.974
I get it.

31:34.043 --> 31:35.476
All right, so, like...

31:35.544 --> 31:38.104
when it gets darker,
your eyeballs get bigger...

31:38.180 --> 31:40.273
but then when the lights go on,
you turn into clothes.

31:40.349 --> 31:43.716
Brilliant, Bri, just brilliant.

31:43.786 --> 31:45.549
You must be in, what,
at least grade two.

31:45.621 --> 31:46.815
Six.

31:46.889 --> 31:49.790
A worldly scholar.
Super. I love it.

31:49.858 --> 31:52.759
How about lighting a candle?
These lights are painful, man.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.887
No way.
I have enough problems...

31:54.964 --> 31:56.989
without you running around
getting me into more.

31:57.066 --> 31:59.034
You got your stupid
remote control back.

31:59.101 --> 32:00.534
Now turn off the lights.

32:04.173 --> 32:05.970
Hey, what about the batteries?

32:06.041 --> 32:08.669
I ate them for breakfast.
I’d give 'em to you right now...

32:08.744 --> 32:10.769
but double ''A'' batteries
constipate me, OK?

32:10.846 --> 32:12.006
Maybe a little later.

32:12.081 --> 32:14.777
That's gross.
Hey, and what about my bike?

32:14.850 --> 32:16.283
I’ll get you a new bike.

32:16.352 --> 32:19.753
Just get me
out of these clothes!

32:20.990 --> 32:24.926
Honest, I’m burning up.
My inseams are on fire!

32:24.994 --> 32:29.431
All right, but any funny moves,
and you're clothes.

32:41.810 --> 32:45.337
Grazie, boy, grazie.
You're a pretty sharp kid.

32:45.414 --> 32:48.975
You're ugly, but you're sharp.

32:49.051 --> 32:50.814
Wait. Let me get it.

32:52.988 --> 32:57.049
You know, I thought it was
something good, but it's snot.

32:57.126 --> 33:00.892
I’ve been in this business
well over 200 years...

33:00.963 --> 33:03.761
and I’ve never been
trapped once.

33:04.933 --> 33:07.401
-How old are you?
-Eleven.

33:07.469 --> 33:09.869
And I ain't getting
any prettier.

33:09.938 --> 33:13.806
Hey, dude. Come here, bud.
You don't know it yet...

33:13.876 --> 33:16.401
but tonight
is your lucky night.

33:16.478 --> 33:18.412
-What do you mean?
-I mean--

33:18.480 --> 33:21.381
I know, I know. You're gonna
grant me three wishes, right?

33:21.450 --> 33:28.253
Wishes? Wishes are
bush league leprechaun, pal.

33:28.324 --> 33:30.622
I’m a monster, OK?
Look, listen to this.

33:30.693 --> 33:34.459
I’m a monster,
and monsters don't do wishes.

33:34.530 --> 33:36.464
Then what do monsters do?

33:36.532 --> 33:37.692
Good question.

33:37.766 --> 33:42.999
I have the time of my life.

33:50.479 --> 33:52.003
How do you do that?

33:52.081 --> 33:53.548
it’s magic, chump. it is.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.674
You just gotta be handsome
and gorgeous like me...

33:55.751 --> 34:00.245
or have somebody handsome and
gorgeous like me show you how.

34:00.322 --> 34:02.847
Brian Stevenson, come on down!

34:02.925 --> 34:04.085
I can't.

34:05.160 --> 34:08.152
Can't? I hate that word.

34:08.230 --> 34:11.824
That word's like caca to me.
No. Can't. Can't.

34:11.900 --> 34:12.958
You can't jam a basketball.

34:13.034 --> 34:15.799
You can't have a hand grenade
go off in your lap and survive.

34:15.871 --> 34:17.498
Those things you can't do...

34:17.572 --> 34:21.634
but you can take a walk
on the wild side.

34:21.710 --> 34:24.702
Well, look. Even if I do go...

34:24.780 --> 34:26.407
how do I know
I’m gonna be able to come back?

34:26.482 --> 34:27.676
Listen to me.

34:27.750 --> 34:30.810
What goes on down there
is every kid's fantasy.

34:33.621 --> 34:35.453
imagine, if you will...

34:35.524 --> 34:37.719
imagine a world
solely of kids--

34:37.793 --> 34:40.728
kids that just
want to have fun.

34:40.795 --> 34:42.491
And make trouble.

34:42.563 --> 34:46.091
Trouble?
Trouble is our code of honor.

34:46.168 --> 34:49.501
it’s our blood,
our life support system.

34:49.571 --> 34:53.507
it’s our raison d'etre.
That's French.

34:53.574 --> 34:57.033
-Do they all look like you?
-Only the good-looking ones.

34:59.047 --> 35:02.346
Think of it, Bri. No teachers,
no rules, no homework.

35:02.418 --> 35:06.980
No parents. You hear me, boy?
I said no parents.

35:07.055 --> 35:09.023
Man, that alone is worth
all the money in the world.

35:09.091 --> 35:11.787
it’s about leaving your clothes
wherever you want to leave them.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.828
it’s about never having
to clean up after you eat.

35:13.896 --> 35:16.228
it’s about never worrying
about being on time.

35:16.298 --> 35:18.493
it’s about staying up late...

35:18.567 --> 35:21.058
watching whatever it is
you want to watch on TV.

35:21.136 --> 35:23.764
You want to watch Letterman?
The Playboy Channel?

35:23.839 --> 35:26.637
it’s about nailing somebody
that bugs you...

35:26.708 --> 35:28.676
in a way that you never
dreamed possible.

35:28.744 --> 35:30.769
What's that?

35:30.846 --> 35:33.280
it’s about total,
100%, unadulterated...

35:33.348 --> 35:36.340
''where's the beef'' anarchy!

35:36.418 --> 35:40.081
Brian, it's about freedom.

35:41.523 --> 35:45.152
Freedom to live life...

35:45.227 --> 35:50.096
the way the creators
of this planet intended.

35:50.165 --> 35:52.963
Man, that sounds great.

35:53.035 --> 35:54.969
What do you say, bud?
You ready?

35:55.037 --> 35:57.801
Maurice, I was born ready.

36:00.042 --> 36:02.374
But first I’m gonna need
some insurance.

36:02.444 --> 36:05.345
Whoa, there, thunder.
No, no, no.

36:05.414 --> 36:08.679
Candles, matches, even something
festive like this...

36:08.750 --> 36:11.310
this would be nice,
but absolutely nada.

36:11.386 --> 36:13.354
No bright light, OK, bud?

36:13.422 --> 36:15.788
All right!
if you want to take it.

36:15.858 --> 36:17.985
But I’m telling you,
you got to hide it, OK?

36:18.060 --> 36:19.755
-Sure. OK.
-Sure. Come on.

36:22.564 --> 36:25.055
Maurice!

36:36.178 --> 36:37.611
Hey, bud.

36:39.715 --> 36:41.410
What is this place?

36:41.483 --> 36:44.418
I thought the dining room
was under Eric's room.

36:44.486 --> 36:47.182
Well, we're not in Kansas
anymore, buddy.

36:47.256 --> 36:49.850
Come on, take a look at this.

36:51.326 --> 36:53.920
Take a gander, Bri.

36:53.996 --> 36:55.486
Ain't it amazing?

37:07.843 --> 37:10.243
Yo, Brian, move 'em out.

37:10.312 --> 37:11.438
We're burning
night light, pard.

37:11.513 --> 37:14.448
Come on, come on, come on.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.180
Hey, Maurice, like the horns.

37:18.253 --> 37:20.050
Sid!

37:20.122 --> 37:22.283
I never forget a face.

37:22.357 --> 37:23.551
it’s the other one
I can't remember.

37:23.625 --> 37:26.219
Get out of here, bud.

37:26.295 --> 37:27.387
-Did not!
-Did, too!

37:27.462 --> 37:29.692
-Did not!
-Did, too!

37:29.765 --> 37:32.256
Hey, Al, Grizbit,
this is my new bud.

37:32.334 --> 37:34.359
-Hi, Bud.
-Hi. The name's Brian.

37:34.436 --> 37:35.403
Hi, Brian.

37:35.470 --> 37:36.459
-Bud.
-Brian.

37:36.538 --> 37:37.470
-Bud!
-Brian!

37:37.539 --> 37:39.803
-Bud!
-Brian!

37:39.875 --> 37:42.901
Wait a second. What are all
these stairs and ladders for?

37:42.978 --> 37:46.175
Good question, bud.
Every one of these staircases...

37:46.248 --> 37:48.682
leads to some
poor soul's bedroom.

37:48.750 --> 37:50.809
it’s like--
let me put this simply.

37:50.886 --> 37:55.152
it’s a veritable cornucopia
of mischief.

37:55.223 --> 37:56.155
Hi, Maurice.

37:56.224 --> 37:58.749
Hey, come here.
What's that on your shirt?

37:58.827 --> 37:59.953
Where?

38:00.028 --> 38:02.724
Get out of here.
Let me show you around.

38:04.466 --> 38:06.366
Let me show you straight.

38:06.435 --> 38:07.697
Don't do it.
I have to do it.

38:07.769 --> 38:09.236
Don't do it.
Nobody likes you.

38:09.304 --> 38:11.272
Good-bye, cruel world!

38:13.141 --> 38:15.006
Gomer, Brian, Brian, Gomer.

38:16.211 --> 38:19.476
Trick or treat,
smell my feet.

38:24.252 --> 38:25.685
You're gonna love this place.

38:25.754 --> 38:26.914
-What?
-All right.

38:26.989 --> 38:28.581
The magic word.

38:28.657 --> 38:30.352
I forget the magic word.
it’s--

38:30.425 --> 38:31.949
Think, think, think.

38:33.261 --> 38:35.354
That's it.

38:35.430 --> 38:36.920
Come on, bud.

38:36.999 --> 38:38.557
How you doing?

38:40.502 --> 38:43.198
Rock and roll!

38:43.271 --> 38:45.398
Dance with me, baby.

38:45.474 --> 38:47.908
One, two, cha, cha, cha.

38:47.976 --> 38:49.136
One, two...

39:00.389 --> 39:02.482
isn’t this neat, Bri?

39:04.526 --> 39:05.458
Free ball! Free ball!

39:05.527 --> 39:08.826
Hey, what are you doing?
You're going to tilt it.

39:08.897 --> 39:10.762
I know that face.

39:12.567 --> 39:15.627
Kiddo, baby, honey, bubby,
open your eyes.

39:15.704 --> 39:20.107
Don't you know down here
there's no such thing as tilt?

39:30.085 --> 39:32.781
This is my favorite place
on the whole planet.

39:32.854 --> 39:35.288
Every craving
you've ever craved...

39:35.357 --> 39:38.690
every flavor
you've ever flaved.

39:38.760 --> 39:42.161
And the best part is,
you don't see any parents...

39:42.230 --> 39:44.289
telling the kids
what they can't eat, do you?

39:44.366 --> 39:45.424
No.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.161
-Do you?
-No!

39:51.873 --> 39:54.341
Za. I love Za.

39:54.409 --> 39:57.003
Cake.

39:57.079 --> 39:58.341
For later.

39:58.413 --> 40:00.142
Laces tied together.

40:00.215 --> 40:01.807
Hey, somebody
wants you over there.

40:01.883 --> 40:03.111
What?

40:05.253 --> 40:07.187
-Hey, who hit me?
-Hey, don't fight.

40:07.255 --> 40:10.224
Look, somebody
dropped a quarter.

40:10.292 --> 40:12.283
-Whose is it?
-Don't know.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.292
Here, let me give you
a hand with those.

40:13.361 --> 40:15.488
Oh, yeah, me, too. Here.

40:15.564 --> 40:17.657
Hey, Maurice.

40:17.733 --> 40:20.293
-Hey, Schmoog.
-Who's the drip?

40:20.368 --> 40:21.596
Hey, ease off, bud.

40:21.670 --> 40:24.434
This young man, he saved me
from a fatal case of sunburn...

40:24.506 --> 40:27.339
so I decided to give him
the grand tour.

40:27.409 --> 40:30.139
Oh, very well.

40:30.212 --> 40:32.510
-You got a brat in Cleveland...
-A brat in Cleveland.

40:32.581 --> 40:34.572
-an imp in Atlanta...
-An imp in Atlanta.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.844
-And a twerp in Boston.
-And a twerp in--

40:36.918 --> 40:39.386
And a dweeb giving me all this.

40:39.454 --> 40:44.482
Raise hell tonight
and show him how it's done.

40:44.559 --> 40:45.992
I will.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.653
Wait a second.
You're not gonna tell me...

40:49.731 --> 40:52.859
there's an airport
in this place, are you?

40:52.934 --> 40:54.834
Brian. Come on.
Does it look like...

40:54.903 --> 40:57.098
these hunchbacks
can handle a plane?

40:57.172 --> 40:59.766
it’s magic.

40:59.841 --> 41:01.069
That was pretty neat, huh?

41:01.143 --> 41:04.601
You see, down here,
distance is like time.

41:04.679 --> 41:06.544
And time is like...

41:06.615 --> 41:09.413
it's like polyester
with an acrylon blend.

41:14.055 --> 41:16.615
Sorry, bud.

41:17.759 --> 41:21.160
Wait a second.
This is somebody else's house.

41:21.229 --> 41:23.459
No...duh!

41:23.532 --> 41:25.500
Where'd you park the squad car,
Dick Tracy?

41:25.567 --> 41:27.159
Come on.

41:29.004 --> 41:31.370
Hey, chill out, babe, OK?

41:31.439 --> 41:34.237
I mean, you're quick.
That's a good instinct...

41:34.309 --> 41:37.972
but it's a little
primitive, huh?

41:41.716 --> 41:44.241
Not now, Harold.

41:48.990 --> 41:50.617
isn’t he sweet?

41:50.692 --> 41:53.422
I bet you he's dreaming
about puppies...

41:53.495 --> 41:57.261
and his favorite
baseball player.

41:57.332 --> 42:00.495
Yeah. Well, not for long.

42:16.585 --> 42:18.519
-Yellow.
-Yellow.

42:18.587 --> 42:19.781
Yellow.

42:20.822 --> 42:21.846
-Blue.
-Blue.

42:21.923 --> 42:22.912
-Blue.
-Blue.

43:02.197 --> 43:04.131
Chocolate.

43:04.199 --> 43:06.827
Never above 3'6''.

43:06.902 --> 43:08.096
3'6''?

43:09.671 --> 43:11.866
-Always against white.
-Yeah.

43:16.044 --> 43:18.137
You know, Bri,
we live in a world...

43:18.213 --> 43:21.774
dedicated to wreaking hell
on an entire nation of kids.

43:23.318 --> 43:25.286
Hey, they're not that bad.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.913
We're the reason kids
get locked in their rooms.

43:27.989 --> 43:30.287
We're the reason brothers
hate their sisters.

43:30.358 --> 43:36.456
We're also the reason parents
send their kids back to camp.

43:36.531 --> 43:39.830
I love it. I’m alive!

43:39.901 --> 43:42.927
Maurice, is there any way
I can make a special stop?

43:43.004 --> 43:44.972
I want to check somebody out.

43:45.040 --> 43:49.443
You're too good.
You're just too damn good.

43:53.515 --> 43:55.676
Something stinks.

43:58.320 --> 44:02.586
Look at Ronnie Coleman
with his little teddy bear.

44:02.657 --> 44:05.854
And his thumb.
This is classic.

44:05.927 --> 44:07.622
What's this?

44:07.696 --> 44:09.721
-Ronnie's sandwich.
-Ronnie's sandwich.

44:09.798 --> 44:11.356
Yeah. All right.

44:11.433 --> 44:13.333
-What flavor?
-What is it?

44:14.035 --> 44:14.967
Tuna fish.

44:15.036 --> 44:16.867
That stinks.

44:16.938 --> 44:18.428
Cat food.

44:27.315 --> 44:29.215
-And then some tuna.
-Perfect!

44:29.284 --> 44:31.548
And then bake it in the oven.

44:31.619 --> 44:34.986
-Wrap it nicely.
-350 degrees.

44:35.056 --> 44:38.150
OK. All right. Ready?

44:38.226 --> 44:41.286
Turn it face up.
No one will ever notice.

44:42.897 --> 44:44.330
What? What?

44:44.399 --> 44:45.366
Apple juice.

44:45.433 --> 44:46.661
-Hold this.
-So what? Yeah?

44:46.735 --> 44:49.169
What?

44:49.237 --> 44:50.169
You're drinking it?

44:50.238 --> 44:53.969
Maurice, that's disgusting.

44:55.010 --> 44:56.341
What is that all about?

45:01.850 --> 45:03.784
And good for you, too.

45:03.852 --> 45:05.786
What are you doing?

45:05.854 --> 45:07.412
All right, Maurice!

45:07.489 --> 45:10.856
That's great!
All right. Yes.

45:10.925 --> 45:12.187
Oh, yeah.

45:13.962 --> 45:16.055
Yes.

45:16.131 --> 45:18.463
Oh, boy,
what'd you eat today, man?

45:18.533 --> 45:21.661
-Ronnie is gonna be pissed.
-No kidding.

45:33.348 --> 45:37.614
I feel like I have been
on vacation for a week.

45:37.685 --> 45:39.846
Bud.

45:39.921 --> 45:41.616
Oh, no.

45:41.689 --> 45:45.352
My dad's getting up
in ten minutes.

45:45.427 --> 45:48.919
That means
the sun comes up in five.

45:50.465 --> 45:52.399
OK, bud.

45:52.467 --> 45:59.168
I can't bear to see anybody go
up there without protection.

45:59.240 --> 46:01.037
Those UVs can be
pretty dangerous...

46:01.109 --> 46:04.203
-if you know what I mean.
-Thanks.

46:04.279 --> 46:06.372
Yeah. Visiting hours
are over at dawn...

46:06.448 --> 46:08.416
so unless you want
a new residence...

46:08.483 --> 46:11.816
or a set of horns,
we'd better book, bud, OK?

46:11.886 --> 46:16.619
I suppose you're going to
tell me your sister did this?

46:18.560 --> 46:22.326
I’m innocent! I’m innocent!
I’ll take a lie detector test!

46:22.397 --> 46:24.865
if you didn't do it, who did?!

46:24.933 --> 46:26.594
I don't know!

46:26.668 --> 46:29.102
Peter!

46:29.170 --> 46:31.263
it’s because I’m working,
isn't it?

46:31.339 --> 46:34.365
Son, doll hair
never grows back!

46:34.442 --> 46:38.105
What made you think
the cat needed a shave?

46:38.179 --> 46:40.579
Do you want
to go to military school?!

46:40.648 --> 46:44.607
Good morning, Mr. Stevenson!

46:58.733 --> 47:00.257
Move it.

47:09.611 --> 47:12.239
Hey, what's with the glasses,
Rip Van Winkle?

47:12.313 --> 47:13.644
I had a late night.

47:13.715 --> 47:17.082
I bet you were up real late
working on your science project.

47:17.152 --> 47:19.450
Actually, I never
thought of it that way.

47:19.521 --> 47:21.546
Well, mine's all finished.

47:21.623 --> 47:23.818
Great!

47:40.375 --> 47:44.903
Piss! Who put piss
in my apple juice?

47:44.979 --> 47:47.311
-Gross!
-Yes!

47:47.382 --> 47:48.906
Yes! All right!

47:48.983 --> 47:52.510
He spit piss
on the principal!

48:32.727 --> 48:34.820
Maurice!

48:34.896 --> 48:37.194
A natural!

48:37.265 --> 48:38.732
A no holds barred,
dyed in the wool...

48:38.800 --> 48:40.734
no assembly required natural.

48:42.670 --> 48:45.332
-What?
-What? What do you think?

48:45.406 --> 48:48.603
Jeez, I thought I was quick,
but you, Scooby Doo...

48:48.676 --> 48:51.236
you're already moving
through the shadows.

48:51.312 --> 48:52.506
No, I’m not.

48:52.580 --> 48:53.604
-No, you're not.
-No.

48:53.681 --> 48:55.273
-No?
-You pulled me through.

48:55.350 --> 48:58.842
Get out of town.
Fine, fine, fine.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.353
Don't believe me...

49:00.421 --> 49:03.254
but I’m telling you
one thing, buddy boy.

49:03.324 --> 49:05.315
it was a lot easier...

49:05.393 --> 49:08.556
pulling you through tonight
than it was last night.

49:14.435 --> 49:16.562
Maurice, why'd you do that?

49:19.073 --> 49:21.234
Nice ass.

49:23.011 --> 49:24.569
I’m good in twister, too.

49:26.814 --> 49:29.647
Not even my mother
sees me in my boxer shorts!

49:29.717 --> 49:31.309
Well, did you ever
see her in hers?

49:31.386 --> 49:33.820
Say, Bri...

49:33.888 --> 49:37.153
don't you have any cheese
in your life, bud?

49:37.225 --> 49:39.557
Cheese? What kind?

49:39.627 --> 49:42.255
-Mademoiselles.
-What?

49:42.330 --> 49:46.164
Squeeze, tomatoes,
broads, chicks...

49:46.234 --> 49:48.464
girls. I said girls.

49:48.536 --> 49:50.868
Don't you have anybody else in
your life besides your mother...

49:50.938 --> 49:53.771
who wears an over the shoulder
boulder holder?

50:04.952 --> 50:06.977
I think your babe just barked.

50:08.523 --> 50:11.924
So, what's
this Kiersten dame like?

50:11.993 --> 50:16.953
Personally,
I’m a wart and mole kind of guy.

50:17.031 --> 50:19.659
Hey, I’m talking to you.

50:19.734 --> 50:24.501
Well, she's pretty neat,
but she's a girl.

50:24.572 --> 50:25.937
You know, real smart--

50:26.007 --> 50:28.635
always knows the answer,
always raises her hand.

50:28.710 --> 50:31.372
-Always has her homework done?
-Exactly.

50:32.413 --> 50:36.315
I amaze me.
OK, Gumby, Showtime.

50:39.554 --> 50:40.816
I don't believe it.

50:40.888 --> 50:44.415
She likes me.
I thought she hated me.

50:44.492 --> 50:46.357
Why would anybody
hate you, Bri?

50:46.427 --> 50:49.089
All you are is ugly.
Hey, Brian...

50:49.163 --> 50:50.425
I want you to meet
a couple friends of mine.

50:50.498 --> 50:52.022
This is Barbie,
and this is Midge.

50:52.100 --> 50:54.933
These chicks are so close
to my heart.

50:55.002 --> 50:57.527
No, no. it’s just that
ever since we moved here...

50:57.605 --> 51:00.597
I haven't really been able
to make friends, other than you.

51:00.675 --> 51:02.609
And I never thought
anybody really cared...

51:02.677 --> 51:03.769
least of all Kiersten.

51:03.845 --> 51:07.781
Oh, Brian, everybody cares.

51:07.849 --> 51:09.942
it’s just that
certain people...

51:10.017 --> 51:11.314
have a different way
of showing it.

51:11.386 --> 51:15.413
Some people are more giving
than other people, right?

51:17.792 --> 51:19.089
There you go, bud.
Enjoy yourself.

51:19.160 --> 51:22.152
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I’ll keep this.

51:22.230 --> 51:23.891
Hey, look at her flip book.

51:23.965 --> 51:26.593
isn’t this neat?
I can't believe it.

51:33.941 --> 51:36.432
You know, I thought of this.
I gave her the idea.

51:43.351 --> 51:45.717
Man's best friend.

51:45.787 --> 51:49.848
His right hand.

51:49.924 --> 51:52.552
Good boy.

52:02.637 --> 52:04.036
Fine. I won't see you anymore.

52:04.105 --> 52:06.096
I’ll just sleep in the office
and send you the check.

52:06.174 --> 52:07.573
I wouldn't notice
the difference.

52:07.642 --> 52:09.200
That's all you want from me--
my paycheck.

52:09.277 --> 52:12.303
That's not all I want from you.
That's all I get.

52:12.380 --> 52:13.904
I don't know what
you're talking about.

52:13.981 --> 52:16.541
Mr. ''I’ve got a headache.''
We don't even need a door.

52:16.617 --> 52:19.950
Fine, fine.
We won't fight anymore.

52:20.021 --> 52:21.579
Take away the fighting,
there's nothing left...

52:21.656 --> 52:22.953
of our marriage at all.

52:23.024 --> 52:24.389
Keep your voice down.
The kids can hear.

52:24.459 --> 52:25.756
Brian?

52:25.827 --> 52:28.261
Now you care about the kids.

52:33.835 --> 52:35.666
Brian?

52:35.736 --> 52:38.296
Can I have a flashlight?

52:52.653 --> 52:53.984
Oh, shit!

52:55.523 --> 52:59.220
it’s Snik! it’s Snik!

52:59.293 --> 53:01.761
Run, run, run!
Let's get out of here!

53:02.763 --> 53:05.254
Arnie, Arnie, Arnie.

53:05.333 --> 53:10.930
Arnie. You know,
Boy gets what he wants.

53:11.005 --> 53:12.404
When he asks you
for a favor...

53:12.473 --> 53:14.907
you should take that
as a compliment.

53:14.976 --> 53:16.375
But I tried.

53:16.444 --> 53:18.275
You gotta believe me, Snik.
I tried.

53:18.346 --> 53:21.645
Oh, you tried, did you, Arnold?

53:21.716 --> 53:23.513
Well, you didn't try
hard enough!

53:23.584 --> 53:25.609
My knees, they hurt!

53:25.686 --> 53:26.948
Oh, your knees hurt?

53:27.021 --> 53:28.648
Well, that's not all
that's gonna hurt, Arnold.

53:28.723 --> 53:31.157
You know why? Because
I’m gonna take my big thumb...

53:31.225 --> 53:34.626
and jam it in your eye!
Then I’m gonna take my finger...

53:34.695 --> 53:35.889
and put it in the corner
of your mouth...

53:35.963 --> 53:37.487
and I’m gonna rip
the corner of your mouth out!

53:37.565 --> 53:40.693
That's good for a laugh,
isn't it?

53:40.768 --> 53:43.328
You're scared of me,
aren't you, Arnold?

53:43.404 --> 53:45.235
I like that.

53:48.809 --> 53:52.575
I love that.

53:52.647 --> 53:55.343
But you know what I like
even more than that, Arnold?

53:55.416 --> 54:01.321
I like taking my two big
black leather gloved hands...

54:01.389 --> 54:04.950
and grabbing your head
and tearing it off!

54:10.731 --> 54:12.528
Boy gets what he wants!

54:18.039 --> 54:21.167
Hey, remember,
Boy always gets what he wants.

54:21.242 --> 54:26.509
Never ever, ever forget that!
Ever!

54:28.149 --> 54:31.084
Well, you didn't have
to mess up her room.

54:31.152 --> 54:33.279
Bud, if there's one rule...

54:33.354 --> 54:37.518
it's you never ever,
ever, ever...

54:37.592 --> 54:41.528
get emotionally involved
with the victim--ever.

54:41.596 --> 54:43.996
Maurice, she was starting
to like me.

54:46.067 --> 54:48.297
I can't wait
to see her tomorrow.

54:51.572 --> 54:53.335
Let me show you this, bud.
You're gonna love this.

54:53.407 --> 54:54.704
-Yeah.
-This is great.

54:55.876 --> 54:57.969
Look, look.

55:04.452 --> 55:05.680
How do you play this?

55:10.157 --> 55:13.092
Come here. it’s simple.
Let me show you, bud.

55:13.160 --> 55:16.891
All right, we get the shit.
We smash the shit.

55:16.964 --> 55:19.592
And then we put the shit back.
it’s called monster ball.

55:19.667 --> 55:22.295
We do the bashing.
You get the thrashing.

55:22.370 --> 55:24.804
Let's play ball. Come on, bud.

56:04.311 --> 56:05.903
Oh, my god!

56:57.698 --> 56:58.722
No, no!

56:58.799 --> 57:00.699
Hang on!

57:05.773 --> 57:07.866
He's a new kid.
He's with me, Snik.

57:07.942 --> 57:11.969
Maurice! No one should
ever, ever...

57:12.046 --> 57:14.037
come this close
to Boy's stairway!

57:14.115 --> 57:18.609
Right. Never ever, ever come
this close to Boy's stairway!

57:18.686 --> 57:21.052
Hey, kid,
you want a fresh fly?

57:21.122 --> 57:22.111
No, no!

57:23.591 --> 57:26.788
I could break his neck, Maurice.

57:26.861 --> 57:28.852
-I could.
-Let's drop him.

57:28.929 --> 57:30.726
No! He's just kidding.

57:30.798 --> 57:32.231
Snik, think of this.

57:32.299 --> 57:34.267
Dead people
have limited potential...

57:34.335 --> 57:37.793
and I don't think that Boy
would like damaged goods.

57:37.872 --> 57:39.567
But it's your responsibility,
and you--

57:39.640 --> 57:42.409
Oh, no, he's your
responsibility, Maurice.

57:42.409 --> 57:43.034
Oh, no, he's your
responsibility, Maurice.

57:43.110 --> 57:44.042
Right. Right.

57:44.111 --> 57:47.569
if you screw up, I drop you!

57:47.648 --> 57:50.742
That's fair. Let's go, bud.

57:50.818 --> 57:53.878
Oh, my back.

58:03.864 --> 58:06.731
Run. Go, go, go.

58:09.336 --> 58:11.133
Damn it, Maurice, who was that?

58:11.205 --> 58:12.467
-Who, Snik?
-Yeah.

58:12.540 --> 58:15.737
All talk. Just a big mouth.

58:15.810 --> 58:17.437
And ever since he developed
that hump...

58:17.511 --> 58:18.808
he's been such a bitch.

58:18.879 --> 58:21.245
But you learn
to stay away from Snik...

58:21.315 --> 58:23.078
and his staircase, OK, bud?

58:23.150 --> 58:24.310
No kidding.

58:24.385 --> 58:26.444
Let's move it.
You're such a doll.

58:26.520 --> 58:28.545
Come on.

58:29.623 --> 58:32.251
-But he wasn't there.
-Was the window open?

58:32.326 --> 58:33.953
I don't know. I didn't check.

58:34.028 --> 58:36.792
Maybe he went outside.

58:36.864 --> 58:39.594
Maybe he stepped outside
to smoke a cigarette.

58:39.667 --> 58:40.895
I bet that's it.

58:40.968 --> 58:43.528
At 4:00 in the morning?

58:47.107 --> 58:48.574
And I just--yes.
That was very--

58:48.642 --> 58:51.110
You brought that up
great, and--

58:51.178 --> 58:53.373
Well, Mr. Stevenson...

58:53.447 --> 58:55.005
thank you for joining us.

58:55.082 --> 58:56.913
Please come in.

58:56.984 --> 58:59.509
You're just in time
for Kiersten's presentation.

58:59.587 --> 59:01.350
Kiersten, are you ready?

59:01.422 --> 59:05.017
-Yes, I am, Mr. Finn.
-Oh, look at this.

59:06.126 --> 59:08.253
-That's wonderful.
-Thank you.

59:08.329 --> 59:09.694
Do you have
your research report?

59:09.763 --> 59:11.196
-Yes.
-OK.

59:16.770 --> 59:18.965
I thought I did.

59:19.039 --> 59:20.404
Maurice.

59:20.474 --> 59:23.068
I guess my dog chewed it up.

59:23.143 --> 59:25.839
Oh, right.
You don't even have a dog.

59:27.248 --> 59:29.842
All right, that's enough.

59:40.494 --> 59:42.394
Hey, Bri,
nothing to worry about.

59:42.463 --> 59:43.555
Only a drill.

59:45.799 --> 59:47.130
Hey, pard,
what's with the lights?

59:47.201 --> 59:49.169
-Something personal?
-Yeah, you.

59:49.236 --> 59:54.003
Me? Your only friend
in the whole world?

59:54.074 --> 59:56.406
Window pain.

59:56.477 --> 59:59.105
My used-to-be only friend
in the whole wide world.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:00.771
You messed up
Kiersten's homework.

01:00:00.848 --> 01:00:03.180
What? What did I do
to the homework?

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:05.343
You chewed it up.
You destroyed it.

01:00:05.419 --> 01:00:07.284
You know she got a Zero
because of you?

01:00:08.856 --> 01:00:11.222
Brian, I was hungry, OK?

01:00:11.292 --> 01:00:14.284
And it just so happened
at that moment...

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:16.522
I had a craving
for a six-page paper...

01:00:16.597 --> 01:00:18.997
on the daytime blooming
of a nighttime cactus.

01:00:19.066 --> 01:00:20.033
And I’ll tell you
something else.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.761
I got incredible heartburn
from that.

01:00:21.835 --> 01:00:24.599
I can't believe you did that.
I asked you not to...

01:00:24.672 --> 01:00:26.299
and you just went ahead
and did it anyway.

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:28.773
Brian, I happen to have a...

01:00:32.813 --> 01:00:34.781
You like her, don't you?

01:00:34.848 --> 01:00:36.475
No, I don't.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:37.983
Yes, you do.

01:00:38.052 --> 01:00:39.349
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.387
No, I don't.

01:00:40.454 --> 01:00:43.048
Brian's got a girlfriend.
Brian's got a girlfriend.

01:00:43.123 --> 01:00:45.318
No, I don't!

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:47.883
Brian's got a girlfriend.

01:00:47.962 --> 01:00:50.829
Would it help the boo boo
if I said I was sorry?

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:52.957
Here, look, just go back
to your dumb underworld...

01:00:53.033 --> 01:00:55.194
and leave me and Eric alone.

01:01:08.849 --> 01:01:11.784
Dad, what is it?

01:01:11.852 --> 01:01:13.479
Hey, Brian,
come downstairs with me.

01:01:13.554 --> 01:01:16.648
Your mom and I want to talk
to you and Eric for a minute.

01:01:26.834 --> 01:01:28.529
Do you want a ride?

01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:30.866
Sure, Daddy.

01:01:38.212 --> 01:01:41.704
We wanted to talk
to the both of you, because...

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:44.808
well, your mother and l
have come to a decision...

01:01:44.885 --> 01:01:48.082
and it affects all of us.

01:01:48.155 --> 01:01:49.156
We feel you're grown up
enough to understand.

01:01:49.156 --> 01:01:50.748
We feel you're grown up
enough to understand.

01:01:50.824 --> 01:01:52.257
Mom and I have decided...

01:01:52.326 --> 01:01:55.124
that we're not gonna
live together for a while.

01:01:56.196 --> 01:01:57.663
A business trip?

01:01:57.731 --> 01:02:00.222
No, honey, not exactly.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:05.033
Eric, don't you get it?
They're getting a divorce.

01:02:05.105 --> 01:02:09.474
No, Brian, we are not
getting a divorce.

01:02:09.543 --> 01:02:11.704
Yeah, right.

01:02:11.779 --> 01:02:16.011
it’s just that your father and l
need to work some things out...

01:02:16.083 --> 01:02:17.846
and we feel it would be
better if we were--

01:02:17.918 --> 01:02:21.251
Look, it's just like a--
it's a trial separation.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:24.518
God, sorry. That's what you do
before you get a divorce.

01:02:24.591 --> 01:02:26.616
Brian, we're not
getting a divorce.

01:02:26.693 --> 01:02:27.955
So Dad's not leaving?

01:02:28.028 --> 01:02:29.256
-Eric...
-Good.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:32.196
Listen to me. I have to live
in the city for a while.

01:02:32.266 --> 01:02:33.756
Hopefully,
it won't be for long.

01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:35.825
No. You don't have to go.

01:02:35.903 --> 01:02:37.336
Yes, I do.

01:02:38.472 --> 01:02:41.236
Yes, I do.

01:02:41.308 --> 01:02:42.673
But, look,
we'll get to talk every day.

01:02:42.743 --> 01:02:46.611
I’ll be good, I promise.
I’ll be better.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.272
You won't have to go
and live in the city.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:53.217
I swear to God, I’ll be better.
Brian, too. He promises. Right?

01:02:54.922 --> 01:03:00.690
Eric, it's not your fault,
and it's not Brian's fault.

01:03:00.761 --> 01:03:02.922
it isn't anybody's fault.

01:03:02.996 --> 01:03:05.191
it isn't anybody's fault.

01:03:10.471 --> 01:03:12.132
Bri, you all right?

01:03:12.206 --> 01:03:14.572
Yeah, Dad, I’m just fine.

01:04:11.365 --> 01:04:13.128
I heard it all.

01:04:14.401 --> 01:04:16.130
Sucks, huh?

01:04:18.372 --> 01:04:22.138
Yeah. it’s not too good.

01:04:24.011 --> 01:04:25.137
I hate them.

01:04:25.212 --> 01:04:28.204
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:30.648
At least you have a family.

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:38.990
Believe it or not...

01:04:39.059 --> 01:04:42.153
you're the only
real friend I have.

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:45.958
Why do you think
I keep coming back?

01:04:46.033 --> 01:04:47.830
if I didn't like you,
I’d have your parents...

01:04:47.901 --> 01:04:50.631
blaming you for
the shooting of Abe Lincoln.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.574
Come on down.
it’ll cheer you up. Come on.

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:57.940
I don't really feel
like being cheery.

01:04:58.011 --> 01:05:03.677
Oh, Bri, baby...
pranks, snacks, games.

01:05:06.119 --> 01:05:09.020
it’ll take away the hurt.
Come on.

01:05:09.089 --> 01:05:11.751
Know what we could do?
Go see Kiersten.

01:05:11.792 --> 01:05:14.352
We'll bring her flowers.

01:05:14.461 --> 01:05:16.588
I’ve got a great idea.
We'll go to Ronnie Coleman's...

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:18.426
and we'll loosen all the bolts
on his furniture.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:20.762
What do you say?

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:22.734
it’ll be quick.
it’s good for your bones.

01:05:22.803 --> 01:05:25.237
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Come on.

01:05:27.874 --> 01:05:28.806
OK.

01:05:28.875 --> 01:05:32.140
All right! Come on.

01:05:37.184 --> 01:05:40.153
Alley oop!

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:46.318
-You all right, bud?
-Yeah, fine.

01:05:46.393 --> 01:05:47.451
Hey, where's the party?

01:05:47.527 --> 01:05:49.518
Night light out
at the Grossberg's.

01:05:50.631 --> 01:05:52.394
Coming through. New guy.

01:05:52.466 --> 01:05:54.457
Coming through. Excuse me.

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:56.468
Move over. Come on, bud.

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:58.663
is this the line
with tickets?

01:05:58.739 --> 01:06:01.173
Come on, bub. New guy.

01:06:13.387 --> 01:06:14.718
We're here.

01:06:16.089 --> 01:06:17.454
Bri, I’d like you to meet
some of my friends.

01:06:17.524 --> 01:06:21.085
This is Sherry, Debbie,
Pumpkin, Bernie.

01:06:21.161 --> 01:06:22.924
This is great.

01:06:22.996 --> 01:06:24.987
Well, let's do it, man.
This is fun.

01:06:25.065 --> 01:06:26.828
Scare the hell out of her, Bri.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.765
Go ahead, Tonto.
Make her poop her Pampers.

01:06:28.835 --> 01:06:31.497
Make her doody her diapers.
Make her caca her crib.

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:33.061
Watch this. He's great.

01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:34.266
Go ahead, bud.

01:06:34.341 --> 01:06:37.276
Maurice,
she's just a little baby.

01:06:37.344 --> 01:06:39.608
Baby, baby, baby.
it’s our duty, man.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.840
This is a character builder.

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:43.075
Come on, Tonto.
Scare the hell out of her.

01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:45.448
Watch this, guys.
Watch this.

01:06:45.519 --> 01:06:47.180
Go ahead.

01:06:47.254 --> 01:06:49.381
Scare the hell out of her.

01:06:49.456 --> 01:06:50.946
-Boo.
-Boo?

01:06:51.024 --> 01:06:52.491
-Boo.
-Boo?

01:06:52.559 --> 01:06:54.026
What are you, the tooth fairy?

01:06:59.032 --> 01:07:00.158
Stop it.

01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:03.569
Come on, stop it!

01:07:04.671 --> 01:07:06.366
Brian, relax, OK?

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.203
Maurice, this is cruel.

01:07:12.679 --> 01:07:14.169
Baby!

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.052
-Light!
-Brian!

01:07:45.412 --> 01:07:48.210
Todd, are you OK?
What happened?

01:07:49.583 --> 01:07:51.016
Brian!

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.171
I’m shrinking.

01:08:20.913 --> 01:08:23.178
Something's wrong.

01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:39.796
So, how are the kids taking it?

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:41.127
They're fine.

01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:43.066
Eric went to school.
Brian stayed home.

01:08:43.136 --> 01:08:45.604
He's upstairs...

01:08:45.671 --> 01:08:48.607
sawing the legs
off all the beds.

01:08:50.676 --> 01:08:55.808
OK, so I guess each kid just has
his own way of dealing with it.

01:08:57.617 --> 01:08:59.983
Beats being an axe murderer
in ten years.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:04.216
Yeah.

01:09:06.126 --> 01:09:08.026
Just give me a second.
I can--

01:09:09.328 --> 01:09:11.490
We almost had him.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.795
He was becoming one of us.

01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:18.200
He knows our secrets, Maurice.

01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:20.569
I’ll tell you. You know what?
Let's leave him alone.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.800
We'll just
leave him alone, and--

01:09:21.875 --> 01:09:23.240
You just don't get it,
Maurice.

01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:25.437
Sometimes Boy
gets a little lonely.

01:09:25.511 --> 01:09:28.037
He wanted to play with him.

01:09:28.113 --> 01:09:30.377
Why doesn't he just
play with himself?

01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:32.714
Why doesn't Boy
play with himself?

01:09:32.786 --> 01:09:35.118
Yeah.

01:09:35.188 --> 01:09:36.120
Come here.

01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:37.156
No. Don't get me upset, Snik.

01:09:37.224 --> 01:09:40.625
You know what happens
when I get upset.

01:09:40.694 --> 01:09:42.389
That's it. I’m upset.

01:09:47.267 --> 01:09:48.598
What the hell is that?

01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:50.658
I don't know. That's what
happens when I get upset.

01:09:55.308 --> 01:09:56.240
You know something?

01:09:56.309 --> 01:09:57.241
What? No.

01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:58.504
I don't like you, Maurice.

01:09:58.578 --> 01:10:01.274
You're always trying
to be so funny.

01:10:01.348 --> 01:10:02.406
Well, I got
a little riddle for you.

01:10:02.482 --> 01:10:03.676
OK.

01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:08.119
What happens when boy
doesn't get what he wants?

01:10:08.188 --> 01:10:10.247
I don't know.
I have a hunch.

01:10:11.391 --> 01:10:13.951
Hunch? is that my hunch
you're talking about, Maurice?

01:10:14.027 --> 01:10:15.255
Oh, no, no. I take it back.

01:10:15.328 --> 01:10:16.420
-I take it--
-Back?

01:10:16.496 --> 01:10:17.986
-No.
-Hunchback?

01:10:18.064 --> 01:10:21.431
You bring a kid in here?
You tell him our secrets?

01:10:21.501 --> 01:10:22.934
My horn!

01:10:23.003 --> 01:10:25.528
if you can't get him,
I will.

01:11:00.407 --> 01:11:02.705
Mom!

01:11:09.416 --> 01:11:12.044
Brian! Wake up, wake up!

01:11:12.118 --> 01:11:13.278
Eric's gone.
Have you seen him?

01:11:13.353 --> 01:11:16.481
-Do you know where he went?
-Gone? He's gone?!

01:11:16.556 --> 01:11:19.457
Look, Brian, if you know
anything, tell me right now.

01:11:19.526 --> 01:11:20.618
He's not in his room?

01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:22.628
No. Do you think
he went to see Daddy?

01:11:22.696 --> 01:11:25.688
-He wouldn't do that, would he?
-No.

01:11:25.765 --> 01:11:28.290
Todd's house.
Maybe he's there.

01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:04.699
Come on, Toad. Be awake.

01:12:08.274 --> 01:12:09.605
All right.

01:12:09.676 --> 01:12:11.007
Go away!

01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:13.045
Toad, come on. I need you...

01:12:13.113 --> 01:12:15.513
and every spare flashlight
you have in the house--now.

01:12:15.582 --> 01:12:18.278
Leave me alone, Brian.
You're one of them.

01:12:18.351 --> 01:12:21.809
Todd, listen to me.
They have Eric.

01:12:26.059 --> 01:12:27.458
Who has Eric?

01:12:27.527 --> 01:12:29.654
The monsters.
They kidnapped him.

01:12:29.729 --> 01:12:31.788
Kidnapped him?
Which monsters?

01:12:31.865 --> 01:12:33.332
The little monsters.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:57.313
Hi, Kiersten.

01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:59.381
Brian, what's wrong?

01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:00.983
I know you're not
gonna believe it...

01:13:01.061 --> 01:13:03.859
but I need some help
on my science project.

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:07.229
-is this some sort of prank?
-No, I’m serious.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.598
I need your key
to get into the supply room.

01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:13.036
it’s an emergency.
I need some lights.

01:13:13.106 --> 01:13:15.540
Do you expect me
to believe that?

01:13:15.608 --> 01:13:18.168
it defies every rule known
to the scientific mind.

01:13:18.244 --> 01:13:20.371
So you don't believe me?
Well, watch this.

01:13:26.653 --> 01:13:28.518
Holy shit!

01:13:28.588 --> 01:13:31.523
Amazing!

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.968
I hope this works.

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:18.333
Oh, man, that'll get 'em.

01:14:18.404 --> 01:14:20.099
That's like a howitzer
or something.

01:14:20.173 --> 01:14:22.300
You must know a lot
about electricity to do that.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:24.809
How come you get Fs in science?

01:14:24.878 --> 01:14:26.140
Let's go.

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:28.407
Yeah.

01:14:35.155 --> 01:14:37.385
What are you doing?

01:14:37.457 --> 01:14:39.254
I’m setting my alarm
for sunrise.

01:14:39.325 --> 01:14:40.792
What the heck for?

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:43.522
All right, when this goes off,
we have three to five minutes.

01:14:43.596 --> 01:14:46.087
if we're not out before
the sun clears the horizon...

01:14:46.166 --> 01:14:48.930
we'll turn into monsters.

01:14:49.002 --> 01:14:51.493
-Monsters.
-Monsters?

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:53.732
You mean there's a chance
we might not make it?

01:14:53.807 --> 01:14:56.367
Yeah, of course
there's a chance.

01:14:56.442 --> 01:14:59.969
I know where Eric is, but I’m
not leaving until I have him.

01:15:00.046 --> 01:15:01.707
Are you still in?
You don't have to.

01:15:01.781 --> 01:15:04.341
I’m in. Eric's my best friend.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:05.441
Come on, let's go.

01:15:05.518 --> 01:15:07.110
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

01:15:07.187 --> 01:15:08.347
You're not leaving without me.

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:10.252
in the name of science,
I’m going.

01:15:10.323 --> 01:15:14.225
OK. Let's do it.

01:15:15.895 --> 01:15:18.125
You can't get through
without me.

01:15:18.198 --> 01:15:20.063
Hold on. Ready?

01:15:20.133 --> 01:15:22.795
I’m ready.

01:15:30.009 --> 01:15:31.670
it’s a parallel dimension.

01:15:36.716 --> 01:15:38.047
Give me that!

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:39.414
My knapsack!

01:15:45.058 --> 01:15:46.992
Lights!

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:49.528
-Lights!
-Lights!

01:15:52.065 --> 01:15:54.158
-Lights!
-Lights!

01:16:03.743 --> 01:16:05.233
This way.

01:16:26.532 --> 01:16:28.659
That's the master staircase.

01:16:28.735 --> 01:16:30.999
it goes up to Boy's room.

01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:32.469
Who's Boy?

01:16:32.538 --> 01:16:34.199
The guy who runs this place.

01:16:36.009 --> 01:16:38.705
Stick with me. I know the way.

01:16:58.698 --> 01:17:02.225
Careful. it’s a long way down.

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:58.690
Brian Stevenson.

01:17:58.758 --> 01:18:02.023
The real boy wonder.
What a pleasure it is...

01:18:02.095 --> 01:18:03.858
to finally make
your acquaintance.

01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:05.488
Where's Eric?

01:18:05.565 --> 01:18:07.032
And you brought some little
playmates along with you.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:11.537
How nice. Are they as tactful
and fleet-footed as yourself?

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:13.435
I daresay they don't look it.

01:18:13.506 --> 01:18:15.201
I want my brother!

01:18:17.043 --> 01:18:22.640
Now, Brian, what sort
of a greeting is that?

01:18:22.715 --> 01:18:25.309
After all,
we are so much alike.

01:18:25.385 --> 01:18:33.156
if you stay, you will be the one
in charge of yourself.

01:18:33.226 --> 01:18:37.424
Perhaps this whole world,
in time.

01:18:37.497 --> 01:18:41.661
You'll be the one
with the power, the authority.

01:18:41.734 --> 01:18:45.465
Not your parents,
not your teachers--

01:18:46.839 --> 01:18:48.067
you.

01:18:53.079 --> 01:18:56.947
Now, Brian,
isn't that what you want?

01:19:01.554 --> 01:19:03.021
I want Eric--

01:19:03.089 --> 01:19:05.353
now!

01:19:05.425 --> 01:19:07.791
Brian.

01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:10.658
Why such cruelty?

01:19:14.534 --> 01:19:20.564
You're a very unique
individual, Brian.

01:19:22.141 --> 01:19:26.339
Your feats
are unprecedented here.

01:19:26.412 --> 01:19:28.880
Why, I can scarcely
remember the last time...

01:19:28.948 --> 01:19:31.280
one of our little breed
had been trapped.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:35.013
Not once, but numerous times.

01:19:35.088 --> 01:19:38.580
Enough wind, loafer breath!
Hand over the kid!

01:19:38.658 --> 01:19:40.285
Where is he? Let's see him!

01:19:41.761 --> 01:19:43.194
Very well.

01:19:45.932 --> 01:19:47.957
Let's have the contestants
take a look...

01:19:48.034 --> 01:19:49.695
behind curtain number one.

01:19:57.443 --> 01:19:59.570
Brian?

01:20:01.013 --> 01:20:02.071
Brian.

01:20:09.122 --> 01:20:10.783
Let's make a deal.

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:15.424
it’s your wits and grace
that I desire...

01:20:15.495 --> 01:20:18.658
not those of your
pugnacious chum...

01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:22.098
or even your silly,
mute little girlfriend.

01:20:22.168 --> 01:20:24.796
I’ll let them all go...

01:20:24.871 --> 01:20:28.534
and your brother...

01:20:28.608 --> 01:20:32.442
if you'll stay...

01:20:32.512 --> 01:20:35.106
and be my pal.

01:20:35.181 --> 01:20:36.648
No deals.

01:20:38.784 --> 01:20:40.274
Very well.

01:20:44.257 --> 01:20:45.554
Eric!

01:20:47.827 --> 01:20:50.193
Let him go now!

01:20:50.263 --> 01:20:52.163
I’ll give you ten seconds!

01:20:52.231 --> 01:20:55.894
Ten, nine, eight...

01:20:57.603 --> 01:20:59.833
Be sensible, Brian.

01:20:59.906 --> 01:21:02.704
Why lose five lives
when you can gain four?

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:04.572
in an hour,
you and your chums...

01:21:04.644 --> 01:21:06.839
will all be monsters,
and then we can all play.

01:21:06.913 --> 01:21:09.040
seven, six...

01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:10.343
Brian?

01:21:10.416 --> 01:21:12.976
five, four...

01:21:15.621 --> 01:21:17.452
Let's blow him away, Brian!

01:21:17.523 --> 01:21:19.150
Three! Let Eric go!

01:21:19.225 --> 01:21:21.420
Two, one!

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.034
Hi! Are you looking
for your brother?

01:22:10.109 --> 01:22:11.542
Well, we've got him!

01:22:16.115 --> 01:22:17.173
No!

01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:20.686
I hoped we could
be friends, Brian...

01:22:20.753 --> 01:22:23.722
but evidently,
you don't play fair.

01:22:23.789 --> 01:22:25.882
Boy, I haven't even
begun to play!

01:22:25.958 --> 01:22:27.653
Let go!

01:22:27.727 --> 01:22:31.254
Snik, show Brian to his room.

01:22:39.071 --> 01:22:41.005
Bye-bye, Brian!

01:22:59.058 --> 01:23:01.788
Brian. it’s you.

01:23:01.861 --> 01:23:03.692
Todd, is Eric here?

01:23:04.997 --> 01:23:06.123
Nope.

01:23:06.198 --> 01:23:07.426
Kiersten.

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:25.447
Maurice! What happened?

01:23:25.518 --> 01:23:28.009
What happened?

01:23:28.087 --> 01:23:30.555
Two inches lower
and this bonehead...

01:23:30.623 --> 01:23:32.614
would be talkin'
to my lawyer, buddy boy.

01:23:32.692 --> 01:23:34.557
You know him? He's a monster.

01:23:34.627 --> 01:23:36.652
Yeah, Todd, Kiersten,
this is Maurice.

01:23:36.729 --> 01:23:38.356
A monster?

01:23:38.431 --> 01:23:41.025
I have an idea.
We can generate light...

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:42.795
by wiring pencils to the phone.

01:23:42.868 --> 01:23:46.167
Yo, babe. Light from pencils?

01:23:46.238 --> 01:23:47.705
And I’m the pope.

01:23:48.874 --> 01:23:51.638
Just like a carbon lamp
from a projector.

01:23:55.014 --> 01:23:56.038
Done.

01:23:56.115 --> 01:23:58.515
Todd, you crank.
Brian, you hold the pencils...

01:23:58.584 --> 01:24:01.246
and I’ll slide the dirty laundry
under the door.

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:07.956
Good idea.

01:24:08.027 --> 01:24:09.619
Faster, Todd.

01:24:09.695 --> 01:24:12.061
-Go, Toad, go!
-Faster.

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:13.598
Go, Toad, go!

01:24:15.968 --> 01:24:18.801
-Faster!
-I’m trying!

01:24:18.871 --> 01:24:20.099
-if at first...
-Come on!

01:24:20.172 --> 01:24:23.903
you don't succeed,
try, try...

01:24:23.976 --> 01:24:25.500
a light!

01:24:46.665 --> 01:24:48.360
OK, now open the door.

01:24:50.970 --> 01:24:53.768
OK, Maurice, let us out.

01:24:55.007 --> 01:24:58.534
Any of you freaks know how
to pick a combination lock?

01:25:04.283 --> 01:25:06.308
Just jokin'!
What are you doin' lyin' around?

01:25:06.385 --> 01:25:08.717
We got work to do, bud.

01:25:08.788 --> 01:25:10.779
Where are you going?

01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:12.653
To get some more firepower.

01:25:12.725 --> 01:25:14.590
Oh...you see...

01:25:16.962 --> 01:25:18.327
Let's go.

01:25:25.971 --> 01:25:27.632
All right, let's do it.

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:30.607
-Come on.
-Keep it going. Come on.

01:25:33.546 --> 01:25:36.413
Oh, Ronnie?

01:25:41.987 --> 01:25:44.046
We'll need the sun lamps.

01:25:44.123 --> 01:25:46.148
Oh, this is good.

01:25:52.565 --> 01:25:53.691
Here we go!

01:27:10.042 --> 01:27:11.669
Say good night, Boy!

01:27:22.955 --> 01:27:25.549
Oh, shit!

01:27:36.302 --> 01:27:38.702
The beeps!
We gotta get outta here!

01:27:38.771 --> 01:27:41.331
Eric's here somewhere.
I know it.

01:27:41.407 --> 01:27:42.601
Come on!

01:27:45.711 --> 01:27:47.702
Wait till
I get my hands on you.

01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:49.543
I’m gonna kick your butt
with this boot.

01:27:49.615 --> 01:27:54.314
I gotta get it together.
I gotta get myself together!

01:28:02.428 --> 01:28:05.955
Kiersten, take the curtain.
You guys take the box.

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:07.328
-I got it.
-Right.

01:28:08.901 --> 01:28:10.630
Nope. Nothing in there.

01:28:10.703 --> 01:28:12.796
Brian.

01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:15.237
Brian...Brian.

01:28:15.307 --> 01:28:18.140
Help us with this one, boys.

01:28:19.244 --> 01:28:20.370
it’s not budging.

01:28:20.446 --> 01:28:22.880
-Look, a crank, a crank.
-it won't budge.

01:28:25.951 --> 01:28:27.316
Eric!

01:28:27.386 --> 01:28:28.978
Eric!

01:28:29.054 --> 01:28:30.385
All right, man!

01:28:30.456 --> 01:28:32.424
Come on, let's get outta here!

01:28:32.491 --> 01:28:33.617
Let's get outta here!

01:28:39.932 --> 01:28:41.490
Oh, shit!

01:28:43.369 --> 01:28:44.859
How much time?

01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:47.364
Maybe a minute.

01:28:47.439 --> 01:28:50.101
Great. Coleman,
you think you could take him?

01:28:50.175 --> 01:28:51.107
No way!

01:28:51.176 --> 01:28:55.010
Looks like there's no way out!

01:29:01.253 --> 01:29:04.450
Who is that guy?

01:29:09.061 --> 01:29:10.790
Hey, Snik.

01:29:12.831 --> 01:29:15.994
How about a light, bud?

01:29:20.339 --> 01:29:22.534
Come on, let's go home!

01:29:22.608 --> 01:29:24.166
Don't step on me!

01:29:55.908 --> 01:29:58.342
Ding dong,
the Snik is dead! Yeah!

01:30:20.966 --> 01:30:23.025
Brian. Brian.

01:30:24.303 --> 01:30:25.565
Wait.

01:30:25.637 --> 01:30:26.797
Let's go.

01:30:26.872 --> 01:30:28.396
Sit down.

01:30:28.474 --> 01:30:29.736
What?

01:30:29.808 --> 01:30:31.105
Brian...

01:30:31.176 --> 01:30:32.666
sit down.

01:30:39.318 --> 01:30:41.980
it’s too late.

01:30:43.789 --> 01:30:45.723
What's that supposed to mean?

01:30:45.791 --> 01:30:48.851
it means we've dissected
our last frog.

01:30:48.927 --> 01:30:50.827
We're stuck.

01:30:50.896 --> 01:30:52.989
We're monsters.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.634
Well, I can handle that.

01:30:57.703 --> 01:30:59.102
Yeah.

01:31:00.472 --> 01:31:02.406
Yeah, well, I can't.

01:31:03.842 --> 01:31:06.367
Come on. Follow me.

01:31:06.445 --> 01:31:08.413
Well, where you goin', bud?

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:11.210
-West!
-Hey, Brian, wait up.

01:31:11.283 --> 01:31:12.580
Yeah, right.

01:31:12.651 --> 01:31:14.812
Hey, Brian, wait up!

01:31:18.824 --> 01:31:21.258
Come on, hurry!

01:31:44.249 --> 01:31:46.274
The sun's up in St. Louis, bud.

01:31:46.351 --> 01:31:48.444
Oh, man!

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.545
Phoenix! Phoenix!

01:31:50.622 --> 01:31:53.352
-Where's Phoenix?
-Phoenix? That-a-way.

01:31:53.425 --> 01:31:55.416
That-a-way. Come on, kids.

01:32:12.377 --> 01:32:14.311
Hey, bud.
Bet the sun's up, huh?

01:32:14.379 --> 01:32:17.177
I gotta quit smoking.

01:32:17.249 --> 01:32:19.012
Try California!

01:32:53.352 --> 01:32:54.546
All right!

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:56.110
Come on!

01:32:56.188 --> 01:32:57.621
You're goin' home!

01:32:57.689 --> 01:32:59.714
All right!

01:32:59.791 --> 01:33:01.850
Here we go. Goin' home.

01:33:01.927 --> 01:33:03.918
-Goin' up!
-Yeah!

01:33:10.102 --> 01:33:11.126
We're goin' home.

01:33:11.203 --> 01:33:12.397
You're goin' home.

01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:19.202
Come on.

01:33:19.278 --> 01:33:21.405
We're goin' home, guys.

01:33:29.321 --> 01:33:31.755
-Come on.
-Radical, man.

01:33:38.997 --> 01:33:41.795
Come on, yeah!

01:33:44.136 --> 01:33:45.763
Come on, Ronnie.

01:33:49.574 --> 01:33:52.407
Oh, pardon me, sir.

01:33:55.314 --> 01:33:56.679
Well...

01:33:59.117 --> 01:34:00.744
you're next.

01:34:04.690 --> 01:34:06.920
Kinda wish I could stay.

01:34:08.327 --> 01:34:10.227
You'd be a hero down here.

01:34:10.295 --> 01:34:11.455
Maurice, my arm--

01:34:11.530 --> 01:34:14.124
I mean, it turned
to clothes last night.

01:34:14.199 --> 01:34:16.190
Don't worry about that.

01:34:16.268 --> 01:34:17.997
You'll sleep that off.
Nothing's permanent...

01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:20.038
unless you get trapped
down here, bud.

01:34:21.473 --> 01:34:24.806
But I suppose
you gotta get up there...

01:34:24.876 --> 01:34:26.810
'cause you're gonna
get married pretty soon.

01:34:26.878 --> 01:34:29.779
Married? To who?

01:34:30.916 --> 01:34:33.077
To light bulb. Red.

01:34:33.151 --> 01:34:36.985
Oh, Kiersten? No.

01:34:37.055 --> 01:34:38.955
Just friends.

01:34:39.024 --> 01:34:41.925
Friends.

01:34:41.994 --> 01:34:43.723
Yeah.

01:34:43.795 --> 01:34:45.126
Well...

01:34:46.498 --> 01:34:48.466
I guess that's
what it's all about, huh?

01:34:48.533 --> 01:34:51.991
Yeah. I guess.

01:34:54.239 --> 01:34:55.672
You know what?

01:34:57.242 --> 01:34:59.506
You're the best friend
I’ve ever had.

01:35:05.150 --> 01:35:07.744
You're the ugliest friend
I ever had.

01:35:09.021 --> 01:35:10.784
Time to move on, bud.

01:35:10.856 --> 01:35:13.120
I’m gonna miss you, Maurice.

01:35:13.191 --> 01:35:14.920
I really am.

01:35:14.993 --> 01:35:17.894
Let's go, Brian.
The sun's coming up.

01:35:17.963 --> 01:35:20.659
There's no way
I’m running to Hawaii.

01:35:24.002 --> 01:35:25.867
Hang on.

01:35:25.937 --> 01:35:27.461
Hang on.

01:35:32.477 --> 01:35:33.842
Oh, no. Maurice--

01:35:33.912 --> 01:35:35.379
Oh, just relax.

01:35:36.982 --> 01:35:38.711
I can get another one.

01:35:38.784 --> 01:35:41.514
How else are you gonna
remember me anyway?

01:35:42.621 --> 01:35:44.953
Come on, Brian, let's go.

01:35:52.364 --> 01:35:53.888
Bye, Maurice.

01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:19.122
Remember--where there's a bed,
there's a way.

01:36:38.043 --> 01:36:39.601
Come on, let's go!

01:36:58.130 --> 01:36:59.893
Come on, Brian!

01:36:59.965 --> 01:37:01.990
Brian!

01:37:05.537 --> 01:37:07.300
Let's go.

01:37:07.372 --> 01:37:08.532
Come on!

01:37:36.334 --> 01:37:39.326
-Hello?
-Mom! I’ve got Eric!

01:37:39.404 --> 01:37:40.837
-it’s Brian!
-it’s Brian!

01:37:40.906 --> 01:37:42.840
-He's found Eric!
-Are they all right?

01:37:42.908 --> 01:37:44.899
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, we're fine.

01:37:44.976 --> 01:37:47.342
-They're all right.
-Thank God. Tell him I’m here.

01:37:47.412 --> 01:37:48.777
Look, Dad's here.

01:37:48.847 --> 01:37:50.644
Stay where you are.
He'll come pick you up.

01:37:50.715 --> 01:37:52.376
-Where are they?
-Where are you?

01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:53.815
Malibu.
