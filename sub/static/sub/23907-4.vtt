WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.702
<i>Deal's off.
You're on your own, Patterson.</i>

00:03.737 --> 00:06.471
<i>The operation's moving
to Mexico and I've got</i>

00:06.506 --> 00:08.373
<i>a year-long file
running on Hearn.</i>

00:08.408 --> 00:10.842
<i>I'm gonna kill Hearn whether
you want him dead or not.</i>

00:10.877 --> 00:13.278
<i>Either way, he is finished.</i>

00:13.313 --> 00:16.248
What's the rest
of this plan of yours?

00:16.283 --> 00:18.650
<i>My brother-in-law,
Roy Brophy...</i>

00:18.685 --> 00:21.186
he's in on the deal,
every detail, and he is gonna

00:21.221 --> 00:23.655
<i>be there.</i>
- <i>Hugo here was gracious enough</i>

00:23.690 --> 00:27.793
<i>to set up a meeting
with his contacts in Columbia.</i>

00:27.828 --> 00:29.661
I'm crewing with you.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.663
No one knows this boat
better than me.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.066
<i>Let's poison Brophy.
You look like a...</i>

00:34.101 --> 00:36.068
tequila man to me.
- I don't drink poison.

00:36.103 --> 00:38.470
What did you do to me?

01:11.304 --> 01:14.372
We're not gangsters.
We didn't kill the man.

01:14.407 --> 01:17.742
Relax. I just gave him some...

01:17.777 --> 01:20.278
sleepy drugs so that he'd
be out of the way

01:20.313 --> 01:23.281
until tomorrow morning.
- The fave's gonna get his end

01:23.316 --> 01:25.784
and Brophy's gonna be fine.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.086
You worry too much, man.

01:30.157 --> 01:32.124
The Slane!

01:32.159 --> 01:34.259
Oh, it's good to have you
back in the mix.

01:34.294 --> 01:36.261
I've missed this.
- I love this picture

01:36.296 --> 01:39.164
of you guys. Who's the kid?

01:43.170 --> 01:44.936
Her name's Crystal.

01:44.971 --> 01:48.673
Hearn and I were like her...

01:48.708 --> 01:50.642
her surrogate fathers.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.380
Isn't that right?

01:58.185 --> 02:00.419
Yeah, cute kid.

02:02.222 --> 02:04.556
Now... our supplier

02:04.591 --> 02:07.025
is just off the coast
of Cartagena.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.427
These guys are new to us.

02:09.462 --> 02:11.363
Don't you already
have suppliers?

02:11.398 --> 02:13.698
We had complications
thanks to the DEA,

02:13.733 --> 02:15.834
so we had to make some changes.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.003
But this deal goes well,

02:18.038 --> 02:20.105
there'll be plenty
of return business.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.841
Now, the contact
is gonna meet you

02:22.876 --> 02:24.910
on this island

02:24.945 --> 02:26.711
right... here.

02:26.746 --> 02:29.481
But you gotta
watch your bobber, man.

02:29.516 --> 02:32.584
These guys are not
to be messed around with.

02:32.619 --> 02:34.520
OK?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.357
You set sail in the morning.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.927
- You're not coming with me?
- I am staying

02:41.962 --> 02:43.828
behind to deal with Brophy.

02:43.863 --> 02:46.665
When he wakes up
and finds that you've sailed

02:46.700 --> 02:48.667
without him,
he's gonna lose his shit,

02:48.702 --> 02:50.835
so I'm staying back
to deal with him.

02:50.870 --> 02:54.173
Get out.

03:00.947 --> 03:04.983
Ahem.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.319
You were never coming.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.021
- What difference does it make?
- First you neglect to tell me

03:10.056 --> 03:11.623
that it's coke, not weed,
and now this.

03:11.658 --> 03:14.626
OK... I swear, man,
you're being more dramatic

03:14.661 --> 03:16.628
than the women out there.
- What other surprises

03:16.663 --> 03:19.564
do you got coming my way?
- Slaney, slow down.

03:19.599 --> 03:22.500
I already took the fall
for you once.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.003
Do you have any idea

03:25.038 --> 03:26.838
what it was like in there?

03:26.873 --> 03:29.174
Looking at 15 years,

03:29.209 --> 03:31.176
knowing that you were here...

03:31.211 --> 03:33.178
and you were free?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.580
Do you think I screwed you?

03:35.615 --> 03:37.382
How should I see it?

03:37.417 --> 03:40.552
- It was dumb luck, Slane.
- Luck?

03:40.587 --> 03:42.454
That's what we're
calling it now?

03:42.489 --> 03:45.056
What's to stop you
from taking my boat...

03:45.091 --> 03:47.125
full of coke...

03:47.160 --> 03:50.095
and just... disappearing?

03:52.132 --> 03:55.667
That's the beauty
of this deal, Slane.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.769
We need each other.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.707
But OK, man.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.409
I could just...

04:04.444 --> 04:07.546
pay you 10 000 and you can...

04:09.182 --> 04:11.316
ride off into the sunset
and our...

04:11.351 --> 04:14.219
business transactions are over.

04:16.122 --> 04:18.257
If that's what you want.

04:21.127 --> 04:23.328
What?

04:25.131 --> 04:27.332
I need to talk to you.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.571
Think about it.

04:36.343 --> 04:40.111
♪ Come on the rising wind ♪

04:40.146 --> 04:43.048
♪ We're going up ♪

04:43.083 --> 04:44.916
♪ Around the bend ♪

04:44.951 --> 04:47.185
♪ Yeah ♪

05:04.371 --> 05:08.006
Brophy's girl.
Something's off about her.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.310
Something's off about her how?

05:12.979 --> 05:14.979
I followed her
down to the beach.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.716
And?

05:17.751 --> 05:19.551
I don't know. She was...

05:19.586 --> 05:21.419
talking to someone.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.021
She's wasted.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.223
Look...

05:25.258 --> 05:27.058
why don't you just focus
on the task at hand

05:27.093 --> 05:28.993
and make sure the clan mates
have the ship we need?

05:29.028 --> 05:33.265
Got it?

06:23.383 --> 06:25.350
What are you doing in here?

06:25.385 --> 06:28.353
I was looking for Roy.
I heard he may have passed out

06:28.388 --> 06:30.622
in one of these... OK.

06:30.657 --> 06:33.558
OK. Listen to me.
Listen. I only came in...

06:33.593 --> 06:35.427
Ah!

06:44.471 --> 06:46.905
What is this?

06:51.010 --> 06:54.746
DEA? FBI? Who sent you?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.282
WHO SENT YOU?

07:19.939 --> 07:22.307
OK.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.954
You think it's
coming or going?

08:12.825 --> 08:15.026
The storm.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.799
That depends on
your point of view.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.902
Is that the port?

08:26.039 --> 08:27.939
The port?

08:27.974 --> 08:30.775
Yeah, the one in Newfoundland,
the one where you got caught.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.244
It's a bay,

08:33.279 --> 08:35.046
and...

08:35.081 --> 08:37.181
you seem to know
an awful lot about us

08:37.216 --> 08:38.917
for someone
who got here a week ago.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.486
I like to pay attention.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.055
I'm a curious person.
- Hmm.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.825
But there is one thing
about you that I just like,

08:47.860 --> 08:49.961
can't quite figure.

08:49.996 --> 08:53.731
- Just the one?
- Here you are,

08:53.766 --> 08:55.800
finally free...

08:55.835 --> 08:59.737
and you choose
to jump right back into it.

08:59.772 --> 09:02.307
The definition of insanity

09:02.342 --> 09:04.609
is doing the same thing
over again and expecting

09:04.644 --> 09:07.045
a different result.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.381
This isn't the same.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.219
What about Hearn?

09:15.254 --> 09:17.055
What do you think

09:17.090 --> 09:18.890
he's after?

09:18.925 --> 09:20.892
Whoever you think

09:20.927 --> 09:22.961
he is...

09:22.996 --> 09:26.397
he isn't.

09:26.432 --> 09:30.268
And if I was you,
I'd keep my head up with him.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.109
Ahem.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.982
And as for the storm, I'd...

09:44.017 --> 09:45.817
I'd say it's coming.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.498
Hey, Slaney.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.002
Let's go for a ride.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.304
You drive.

10:33.232 --> 10:35.667
The Mexican government

10:35.702 --> 10:38.369
subsidizes loads of construction
around here.

10:38.404 --> 10:41.139
They want this to be
a tourist destination.

10:41.174 --> 10:44.142
You know what Cancun
means in Mayan?

10:46.579 --> 10:48.146
Nest of snakes.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.248
Can you believe that?

10:51.551 --> 10:55.387
They wanna turn this...
deserted swamp full of snakes

10:57.190 --> 11:00.124
...into the next
top vacation spot.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.560
Turn shit into sunshine.

11:05.465 --> 11:08.233
Come on. I wanna
show you something.

11:12.138 --> 11:14.105
Now, I know

11:14.140 --> 11:17.075
you said you wanted to save it.

11:19.045 --> 11:21.045
But now...

11:21.080 --> 11:22.980
seems like a good time

11:23.015 --> 11:24.816
to be living in the moment.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.552
Don't you think?

11:38.331 --> 11:40.632
Look at us now, huh?
All these years later.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.837
Things are
a little different, but...

11:45.872 --> 11:48.539
it's still just you and me.

11:48.574 --> 11:50.375
Huh?

11:54.680 --> 11:57.148
Oh, come on, baby!

12:08.127 --> 12:10.428
Hey.

12:10.463 --> 12:14.031
I... I thought you were dead.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.000
Yeah, so did I.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.902
Hearn drugged me

12:17.937 --> 12:19.804
with something
and I feel like hell.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.240
They didn't buy our cover?

12:22.275 --> 12:24.375
Either that or he just wanted
to get me out of the way.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.310
I need to talk to Slaney.
Where is he?

12:26.345 --> 12:29.781
I don't know. Roy. Roy.
We got a bigger problem.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.192
Oh, that's bad.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.035
Hey, baby.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.037
You wanna dance?

12:53.072 --> 12:55.373
Dance with me, baby.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.617
How was it with Slaney?

13:06.652 --> 13:08.319
It went fine.

13:08.354 --> 13:10.154
Hearn has to keep
an eye on him,

13:10.189 --> 13:13.324
so what did you find out?

13:16.195 --> 13:18.496
I just asked you a question.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.134
Are you... playing me now?

13:23.169 --> 13:26.771
You got Hearn's attention, so...

13:28.407 --> 13:30.341
...do I just disappear?

13:30.376 --> 13:32.810
Do you really think
I'd just tag along

13:32.845 --> 13:34.645
on your little drug deal?

13:34.680 --> 13:36.280
That kind of heat

13:36.315 --> 13:39.183
for a few free meals
on a sailboat?

13:39.218 --> 13:41.419
Look, we can s...

13:41.454 --> 13:44.789
We can still have fun, OK?
It's just...

13:44.824 --> 13:46.757
if I'm part of this thing,

13:46.792 --> 13:49.561
it's gotta be on my own terms.

14:01.874 --> 14:04.209
I know you, David Slaney...

14:06.646 --> 14:09.013
...so let's hear it.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.316
Hear what?

14:12.351 --> 14:14.719
You think I screwed you.
You said that.

14:16.555 --> 14:19.023
We let that sit, it's just gonna
eat us up inside,

14:19.058 --> 14:21.425
so... why don't we take

14:21.460 --> 14:24.662
this opportunity here,
just let it all out, huh?

14:29.035 --> 14:32.036
Then what is it? Hmm?

14:34.674 --> 14:37.308
What?

14:37.343 --> 14:39.310
I thought he was joking
at first, but then I

14:39.345 --> 14:42.513
looked into his eyes and I saw
who he was. I saw what he was.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.549
Slane!

14:46.185 --> 14:49.153
I need to make this
right with you.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.027
This is why you're broke,
isn't it?

14:56.062 --> 14:58.829
This is your hotel.
How much, um...

14:58.864 --> 15:01.432
How much you put into it?

15:03.169 --> 15:04.936
Isn't she something?

15:04.971 --> 15:07.972
I'm guessing everything
you have, otherwise you wouldn't

15:08.007 --> 15:10.107
be doing this crazy shit
you're doing.

15:10.142 --> 15:12.343
Maybe you've got
a little nest egg stashed away.

15:12.378 --> 15:15.647
I had an investor
try and take me for a ride...

15:20.286 --> 15:22.153
...but they didn't know me.

15:22.188 --> 15:25.490
Not like you.

15:27.159 --> 15:29.760
Who I am, what I'm capable of.

15:29.795 --> 15:32.396
I mean, you want people
to stop dicking you around,

15:32.431 --> 15:34.231
eventually you have
to show them there's

15:34.266 --> 15:36.768
some consequences, right?

15:39.672 --> 15:41.272
Every single deal,

15:41.307 --> 15:43.507
every single one
had a complication,

15:43.542 --> 15:45.710
or a debt that needed
to be paid,

15:45.745 --> 15:48.279
or someone betraying me.

15:50.549 --> 15:53.718
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm taking a risk...

15:53.753 --> 15:55.653
in Columbia.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.755
You saw that right away.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.457
And yeah,

15:59.492 --> 16:01.626
all of my money is right there.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.796
I...

16:05.831 --> 16:08.032
I owed so much money...

16:10.369 --> 16:13.504
... but there was no way,
there was no way

16:13.539 --> 16:15.506
I was gonna lose.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.610
There was no way I was gonna
let them take this from me.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.181
Everything I had sacrificed
to build this...

16:29.789 --> 16:31.756
This...

16:31.791 --> 16:33.591
is where the next structure

16:33.626 --> 16:35.493
is gonna rise.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.361
But now...

16:37.396 --> 16:41.265
the bodies go
so deep into the mud...

16:43.469 --> 16:46.771
...that they are
never gonna come out.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.645
Anybody who got
in my way, Slaney.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.116
Anybody.

16:59.151 --> 17:03.587
But soon, there is gonna be
20 storeys of concrete

17:03.622 --> 17:06.057
between me and them.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.207
I'm sorry, Slaney.

17:28.514 --> 17:30.515
I'm sorry.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.518
I'm sorry I got away

17:34.553 --> 17:36.387
and you didn't.

17:36.422 --> 17:39.423
And when this ship turns north,

17:39.458 --> 17:42.560
and I know it's going to,
I want you on board with me.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.997
I want you right there.

17:47.032 --> 17:49.133
But I need to know...

17:51.904 --> 17:54.905
...if you can put
all that behind us,

17:54.940 --> 17:57.608
or if it's gonna
be something else.

18:03.282 --> 18:05.549
Because if you wanna
move forward,

18:05.584 --> 18:07.118
we're gonna have

18:07.153 --> 18:11.255
to put all that in the past.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.560
OK?

18:20.099 --> 18:23.101
'Cause the future...

18:26.005 --> 18:27.872
The future

18:27.907 --> 18:30.007
will absolve us

18:30.042 --> 18:32.510
of all our sins.

18:45.724 --> 18:47.925
We gotta report it.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.162
No. They'll shut us down.
Let's just keep this between us.

18:51.197 --> 18:54.098
Patterson-style policing?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.933
Yeah. Get the car.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.536
Bring it up close. I'll dump him
out the window. Be careful.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.185
Oh, no.

19:14.220 --> 19:17.321
The little prick woke up.

19:17.356 --> 19:20.158
There's no way he gets on
that boat, you understand?

19:24.964 --> 19:27.498
Brophy, how was your nap?

19:27.533 --> 19:29.366
That's funny.
That's really funny.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.235
I can't let you on that boat.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.237
No way you're stopping me.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.606
You wanna keep an eye
on this deal.

19:35.641 --> 19:38.342
We respect that.

19:38.377 --> 19:41.879
But what better place
for you to keep tabs on things

19:41.914 --> 19:43.981
than right here?

19:44.016 --> 19:46.317
With Hearn?

19:47.987 --> 19:49.853
You're not going?

19:49.888 --> 19:52.256
No. No, it's in everyone's

19:52.291 --> 19:55.326
best interest if I stay behind.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.494
Besides, I got
my best man on it.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.331
Slane.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.101
I'm gonna come back tomorrow

20:04.136 --> 20:06.103
and the day after that
until my boss gets his cash.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.105
Now, where are you headed,

20:08.140 --> 20:10.107
who are you
buying from and where?

20:10.142 --> 20:12.643
Shit, you're persistent.
I'll give you that.

20:12.678 --> 20:15.713
God! Two weeks,

20:15.748 --> 20:19.684
your boss gets his money, that's
all you need to know. Got it?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.554
- Fine.
- Great.

20:23.589 --> 20:26.424
Make sure they find
their way out.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.062
You don't really think
I'm gonna go along with this,

20:32.097 --> 20:34.732
do you?
- He was gonna kill you.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.935
Both.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.738
This... this can all still work.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.706
How do I know you're
gonna follow through?

20:42.741 --> 20:44.675
How do I know you're
not gonna screw me over?

20:44.710 --> 20:47.745
Because I need something
from you.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.881
Tommy Gabriel is expecting
my end of this deal.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.549
Now that you're here,

20:52.584 --> 20:54.485
I assume I'm
not gonna get anything.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.353
And if he doesn't get
what he wants...

20:56.388 --> 20:58.355
You need protection
for Jennifer

20:58.390 --> 21:01.625
and the little girl.
- Our deal is simple.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.961
Me, you, Hearn,
on that boat together.

21:03.996 --> 21:07.331
We bring back the drugs. Hearn
goes down.
- Our agreement

21:07.366 --> 21:09.266
still stands. It's j...

21:09.301 --> 21:11.468
It's just gotta be different.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.437
I need you

21:13.472 --> 21:15.906
to make sure that Jennifer
is in the clear.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.908
Somewhere where Tommy...

21:17.943 --> 21:19.543
Tommy can't... can't get to her.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.415
We can do that.

21:28.187 --> 21:31.122
You gotta give me your word.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.426
You bring the drugs back here,
I'll take care of Jennifer.

21:35.461 --> 21:38.162
It needs to be in motion now.

21:38.197 --> 21:42.199
We'll make sure
they're safe. Um...

21:42.234 --> 21:45.202
This will track you.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.304
It'll let us know

21:47.339 --> 21:49.640
where you're headed.
Get it somewhere

21:49.675 --> 21:51.509
no one will find it.

21:54.213 --> 21:56.947
Uh... Anyone...

21:56.982 --> 21:58.916
Anyone that's ever...

21:58.951 --> 22:00.451
ever crossed Hearn

22:00.486 --> 22:03.120
or got in his way, he, um...

22:04.690 --> 22:08.759
He dumps their bodies
at his construction site.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.264
- Do you know this for sure?
- You want him on something...

22:14.299 --> 22:16.767
bigger than this drug deal?

22:16.802 --> 22:19.503
Some insurance?

22:21.006 --> 22:24.742
Stick a shovel in that site.
You'll get what you need.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.136
Please, let me
help you with that.

24:33.171 --> 24:35.272
Oh, thanks.

24:41.179 --> 24:42.946
I don't like
the way he's looking

24:42.981 --> 24:45.282
at your girl.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.862
<i>Damn it. We traveled
all this way for this?</i>

24:58.897 --> 25:00.497
<i>If it wasn't for this tracker,</i>

25:00.532 --> 25:03.166
we'd be sunk. We should've
known this could happen.

25:03.201 --> 25:05.769
You and Williams are supposed
to be on that boat.

25:05.804 --> 25:07.971
This changes everything, Roy.

25:08.006 --> 25:11.241
This operation's gone to shit.
- Nothing has changed.

25:11.276 --> 25:13.510
Slaney makes the deal
in Columbia. He sails back here

25:13.545 --> 25:16.780
to Hearn's... lair,
and we take him down.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.982
Trusting an escaped convict
with this entire play...

25:19.017 --> 25:22.452
that was really your best move?
- I don't trust this guy as far

25:22.487 --> 25:24.454
as I could fling him,
but that was our only option.

25:24.489 --> 25:27.391
I told you that already.
- Slaney needs us as much as we

25:27.426 --> 25:29.726
need him.
- You said you had ears

25:29.761 --> 25:32.195
on the place. What'd you get
on the voice recorders?

25:34.566 --> 25:37.834
Didn't pan out. I couldn't
get them in place in time,

25:37.869 --> 25:41.171
and I was drugged before then.
- Unbelievable.

25:41.206 --> 25:44.107
- This is too much.
- We still have the tracker.

25:44.142 --> 25:45.742
It's all gonna work.

25:45.777 --> 25:47.811
We just need to be here
when the drugs get back,

25:47.846 --> 25:49.780
so everybody calm down

25:49.815 --> 25:52.015
and remember the big play here.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.551
Slaney better show up
with that cocaine.

26:45.671 --> 26:47.671
You got any aspirin?

26:51.176 --> 26:53.176
You and Carter have been
having a bit of a party

26:53.211 --> 26:55.278
the past couple of nights.
- Hence me asking

26:55.313 --> 26:57.214
for the aspirin.
- Drink water.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.282
It's better for you than pills.
- Ugh!

26:59.317 --> 27:01.285
Worst drug dealer ever.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.688
You might be right about that.

27:04.723 --> 27:06.890
You know, we're the only two
who know how to sail.

27:06.925 --> 27:08.725
Do you want me to take over?

27:08.760 --> 27:10.527
That'd be great,

27:10.562 --> 27:13.430
although I don't think Carter's
gonna be as cuddly with me

27:13.465 --> 27:16.433
down there as he is with you.
- Whatever you think

27:16.468 --> 27:18.502
Carter and I are doing
in our cabin at night

27:18.537 --> 27:22.172
is far more interesting
than the reality.

27:22.207 --> 27:23.707
Why don't you tell me

27:23.742 --> 27:25.876
a bit about yourself?
Where'd you grow up?

27:25.911 --> 27:28.979
That's a boring topic.

27:29.014 --> 27:32.582
I'm just making conversation,
trying to get to know you.

27:32.617 --> 27:35.652
Why bother? I doubt
we have much in common.

27:35.687 --> 27:37.788
Right.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.656
You're a rich kid. I heard.

27:39.691 --> 27:41.425
Private sailing lessons,

27:41.460 --> 27:45.195
piano lessons, all that.
- Yeah, exactly.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.097
I certainly didn't
learn to sail

27:47.132 --> 27:49.633
at Daddy's yacht club.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.169
Whatever you're
pushing towards, stop.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.671
Just move on.

27:54.706 --> 27:58.175
You're keeping an eye on me
for Hearn.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.410
Is that why you came here,

28:00.445 --> 28:02.646
to spy on me?

28:04.783 --> 28:07.951
She clams up. There's a first.

28:07.986 --> 28:10.587
Are you trying to tell me you
don't have your own agenda?

28:12.290 --> 28:15.459
People are usually motivated
by one of two things:

28:15.494 --> 28:17.561
love or money.

28:17.596 --> 28:20.163
And you're sure as hell
not here for Carter.

28:20.198 --> 28:23.066
Yeah. I'm not here
for Hearn either,

28:23.101 --> 28:25.168
rest assured.

28:25.203 --> 28:28.038
So, money it is.

28:30.308 --> 28:32.275
You know, there's
another thing that tends

28:32.310 --> 28:34.745
to motivate people.
- What's that?

28:34.780 --> 28:36.647
Revenge.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.420
We getting close?

28:43.455 --> 28:47.157
<i>Gentlemen,
your attention please.</i>

28:48.527 --> 28:50.627
We are on the edge
of taking down a criminal

28:50.662 --> 28:53.063
that I've been tracking
for a long time:

28:53.098 --> 28:56.500
Ryan Hearn...
AKA John Barlow.

28:56.535 --> 28:59.436
And in a few days,
we'll have him.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.004
Williams.

29:01.039 --> 29:03.039
You did something

29:03.074 --> 29:05.108
special there. Good job, K.

29:05.143 --> 29:08.178
On that... ahem. Everybody...

29:08.213 --> 29:10.347
you should know that...

29:10.382 --> 29:12.449
I received notification
from my superiors,

29:12.484 --> 29:15.085
and I am not authorized to spend
another dime on this operation.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.354
- What?
- It doesn't matter.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.422
We have Hearn
square in our sights.

29:19.457 --> 29:21.458
We finish this. It's simple.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.460
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- No, Roy.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.729
I am not kidding.
- Hold on a minute. I need him

29:25.764 --> 29:28.732
on drug dealing charges, not
some five-year-old flight rap.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.734
- Kyle...
- We move into Hearn's compound

29:30.769 --> 29:33.470
and we take him into custody.
I am not missing this chance.

29:33.505 --> 29:36.206
Slaney's sailboat is closing
in on the coast of Columbia.

29:36.241 --> 29:38.208
All we gotta do is wait here
'til it gets back.

29:38.243 --> 29:40.677
Hearn goes down, who's to say
someone won't get word

29:40.712 --> 29:43.046
to Slaney that the deal
is blown?

29:43.081 --> 29:45.215
- We'll lose everything.
- My decision's final.

29:45.250 --> 29:48.218
I'm not risking
losing Hearn again.

29:48.253 --> 29:51.421
You didn't
call anybody, did you?

29:51.456 --> 29:54.524
This is your decision.
This decision is a mistake.

29:54.559 --> 29:56.226
We got a body.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.195
One of Hearn's generals:

29:58.230 --> 30:00.864
Hugo Martinez.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.080
Jeff, do you
wanna get these first?

30:18.884 --> 30:22.452
- No, it's OK.
- <i>Morale.</i>

30:46.578 --> 30:48.545
<i>So, they found
Hearn's grave site.</i>

30:48.580 --> 30:50.013
That ought to give us
a bit more time.

30:50.048 --> 30:51.748
Well, we dumped
Hugo's body there.

30:51.783 --> 30:53.917
Remember?
- Yeah, I'm not in a coma.

30:53.952 --> 30:56.353
- They're gonna link us to it.
- Hugo's not gonna be

30:56.388 --> 30:58.288
much of a witness. He's got
an ice pick in his head.

30:58.323 --> 31:00.290
This is not a joke, Roy.

31:00.325 --> 31:02.726
When they move in on Hearn's
place, there is a recording...

31:04.696 --> 31:06.463
...of me killing Hugo.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.665
You understand what that means?

31:08.700 --> 31:11.234
All right. We'll deal with it,
one thing at a time.

31:11.269 --> 31:12.702
Yeah, I'll tell you
how we'll deal with it.

31:12.737 --> 31:14.704
I need to get back in there
and get that recording

31:14.739 --> 31:17.140
before it's too late.
- Not without me.

31:17.175 --> 31:18.775
Since when do I
take orders from you?

31:18.810 --> 31:20.977
These aren't orders. It's just
we should do this together.

31:21.012 --> 31:23.113
You have already
risked enough as it is.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.848
This is my problem. No.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.317
All right. Let me go in there.
I'll try and...

31:27.352 --> 31:29.552
delay things as much
as possible. 5 minutes, tops.

31:29.587 --> 31:31.354
OK?
- OK.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.356
Why don't you get
the clearance on my authority?

31:33.391 --> 31:35.725
OK. Let me get back to you.
I'll let you know.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.028
All right. That sounds good.

32:10.895 --> 32:13.029
<i>If you could go anywhere...</i>

32:13.064 --> 32:14.998
anywhere to live, disappear...

32:15.033 --> 32:17.734
start over, where would you go?

32:17.769 --> 32:19.469
So we're friends now, are we?

32:19.504 --> 32:22.806
I'm just asking you
a question.

32:22.841 --> 32:25.241
If you ask any Newfoundlander
where they wanna live,

32:25.276 --> 32:27.243
and if the answer isn't
immediately Newfoundland,

32:27.278 --> 32:29.245
then you kind of...

32:29.280 --> 32:31.481
you kind of get
the death penalty, so...

32:33.351 --> 32:35.385
You?

32:35.420 --> 32:38.021
I... crewed a tall ship

32:38.056 --> 32:41.791
a few years ago,
and we docked in this port

32:41.826 --> 32:43.426
off of Venezuela, Curacao.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.795
It's this weird
little Dutch island.

32:45.830 --> 32:48.131
I could disappear there.

32:53.271 --> 32:55.539
It's a lie, where I come from.

32:58.043 --> 33:00.610
The trust fund
and the piano lessons.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.280
Piano was obvious.

33:04.315 --> 33:07.517
Your technique is...
is terrible.

33:09.521 --> 33:13.156
It's just a story I tell
people to keep them...

33:14.859 --> 33:16.826
Just to keep a distance.

33:16.861 --> 33:18.828
I get it. I was in prison

33:18.863 --> 33:20.663
for five years.

33:20.698 --> 33:23.033
Sometimes you gotta
protect yourself, just...

33:23.068 --> 33:25.335
keep a little bit

33:25.370 --> 33:27.537
for you.

33:33.311 --> 33:35.445
I found Hearn's diamonds,
the ones you took.

33:37.082 --> 33:39.483
I didn't tell Carter.

33:41.753 --> 33:45.055
You're not gonna follow through
on this deal with Hearn,
are you?

33:45.090 --> 33:47.690
Do you think
I have some big play?

33:47.725 --> 33:51.294
So this entire time,
you've just been winging it?

33:53.098 --> 33:55.432
I wouldn't say that.

33:55.467 --> 33:59.036
I'm just trying to figure out
whose side I should be on.

34:01.372 --> 34:04.741
Well, look at you two.
Thick as thieves.

34:04.776 --> 34:07.377
It's a bit early, babe. You
gotta be on your game, right?

34:07.412 --> 34:10.514
We're nearly there.
- Remember Sheila LaGrue?

34:12.317 --> 34:14.117
Your old babysitter?

34:14.152 --> 34:16.019
Do you remember, Slane?
We used to send you

34:16.054 --> 34:18.021
to play this game called

34:18.056 --> 34:21.825
hide and guess.
It was kind of like, um...

34:21.860 --> 34:24.627
I invented this lazy man's
version of hide and seek.

34:24.662 --> 34:27.097
You know, I'd send him to hide
and then I'd...

34:27.132 --> 34:29.165
unhook the babysitter's bra.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.401
That's the only way
I could get rid of you.

34:31.436 --> 34:33.303
The only way I could
get alone with a chick

34:33.338 --> 34:36.606
was if I had you hiding...
in the washing machine

34:36.641 --> 34:39.142
or something.

34:40.578 --> 34:43.880
No washing machines
around here, though.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.216
Nope.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.855
<i>That grave site's secure.</i>

34:51.890 --> 34:55.725
It seems there's more than Hugo
Martinez's body in that hole.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.660
Whatever they find in that
construction site, we gotta

34:57.695 --> 35:00.196
stick to the plan
and wait for Slaney.

35:00.231 --> 35:01.764
You're beating
a dead horse, Roy.

35:01.799 --> 35:05.468
However this pans out, it's all
in circumstances you've created.

35:05.503 --> 35:07.137
Relax.

35:07.172 --> 35:10.206
You've done some good work here.
I'm proud of you.

35:10.241 --> 35:13.743
I really am. Take the win.

35:33.164 --> 35:35.765
Hey there, party girl.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.201
Hey.

35:38.236 --> 35:41.037
Well, aren't you a party
around the clock?

35:41.072 --> 35:44.507
What are you doing here?

35:44.542 --> 35:48.044
I forgot my purse.
A little clutch.

35:48.079 --> 35:50.413
God, Roy says
I would lose my head

35:50.448 --> 35:54.084
if it wasn't attached.
I'm a bit of a dreamer.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.421
You wanna
get a little dreamier?

35:58.456 --> 36:00.223
Hmm?

36:00.258 --> 36:02.358
Well, I was just gonna
look for my purse...

36:02.393 --> 36:05.428
I think I left it
in the bedroom.

36:05.463 --> 36:06.329
Mm-hmm.

36:08.666 --> 36:11.968
Sweetheart... I'm on a bit
of a bender here.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.270
Bedroom's not gonna work for me.

36:14.305 --> 36:17.340
Come on.

36:25.049 --> 36:27.584
So your, uh...

36:27.619 --> 36:29.419
your friend, your...

36:29.454 --> 36:31.154
your guy,

36:31.189 --> 36:33.022
your escape guy,
he get off all right?

36:33.057 --> 36:35.124
Um... yeah, sure.

36:35.159 --> 36:37.460
Have you heard from him?

36:39.998 --> 36:42.198
Are you asking for a reason?

36:42.233 --> 36:44.701
No, I just...

36:48.406 --> 36:51.774
How long have you
been here all by yourself?

36:51.809 --> 36:53.409
I don't know, a few days.

36:53.444 --> 36:56.079
But I've had lots
of... good company.

36:59.817 --> 37:01.684
Mm.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.786
You know Hugo?

37:03.821 --> 37:06.189
He works for me.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.991
He doesn't like you.

37:08.026 --> 37:11.094
No. He said something

37:11.129 --> 37:12.996
felt off.
- Oh, yeah?

37:13.031 --> 37:15.164
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

37:15.199 --> 37:17.166
Now, at first I thought

37:17.201 --> 37:20.570
it was because you
wouldn't screw him...

37:20.605 --> 37:23.139
but then,

37:23.174 --> 37:25.341
he said he heard you talking

37:25.376 --> 37:27.377
to someone down at the beach.

37:27.412 --> 37:30.346
I don't remember
meeting any...

37:30.381 --> 37:32.515
What'd you say his name was?
- Hugo.

37:32.550 --> 37:35.518
I was pretty wasted
the other night.

37:35.553 --> 37:37.420
I could've been talking
to the Lord himself.

37:37.455 --> 37:40.990
I would not remember.
- Ah!

37:41.025 --> 37:43.293
See... you know,

37:43.328 --> 37:45.828
I haven't heard
from him in days.

37:45.863 --> 37:47.897
And he's missing.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.532
Hmm.

37:49.567 --> 37:52.035
- Imagine that, huh?
- Hmm.

37:54.072 --> 37:56.773
Sit with me.

37:56.808 --> 37:59.442
Come on.

38:03.147 --> 38:05.949
Now, this one...

38:08.086 --> 38:10.687
That one is for you, sweetie.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.956
Come on.

38:28.473 --> 38:31.574
You know, at first, I thought...

38:31.609 --> 38:34.210
you were just...

38:34.245 --> 38:36.379
some eye candy.

38:36.414 --> 38:39.282
Brophy just brought along
some working girl

38:39.317 --> 38:42.151
for him to screw around
with on his vacation,

38:42.186 --> 38:44.153
but then...

38:44.188 --> 38:47.290
then something,
something about you

38:47.325 --> 38:50.860
just wasn't adding up.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.630
How much of this have you had?

38:54.665 --> 38:57.667
Huh?
- Yeah.

38:57.702 --> 39:00.103
It can make someone
a little paranoid,

39:00.138 --> 39:01.938
but sometimes...

39:01.973 --> 39:04.774
sometimes it also can help them

39:04.809 --> 39:08.678
see very, very clearly.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.527
Get Carter.

39:29.233 --> 39:31.467
Hey! They're here, babe!

39:31.502 --> 39:33.669
Let's go!

39:40.711 --> 39:42.712
He's locked himself in the hull.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.055
There is no Carter right now.
I'm Slaney.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.625
OK. Carter is down below.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.895
He's not feeling
so good, OK? Slaney.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.530
- Slaney?
- <i>Si.</i>

40:00.565 --> 40:02.799
- You got the money?
- <i>Si.</i>

40:02.834 --> 40:05.468
You've got the product?

40:07.104 --> 40:09.105
Get your money,
then you come with us.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.707
Maybe that bedroom

40:11.742 --> 40:13.743
ain't such a bad idea.

40:13.778 --> 40:15.745
Huh?

40:15.780 --> 40:18.548
You and me, we can go and...

40:20.351 --> 40:22.985
...look for that clutch
of yours.

40:32.630 --> 40:34.497
What do you think
you're doing? You can't just

40:34.532 --> 40:36.933
go alone with them.
- We don't have time for this.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.901
I need you to go in there
and keep the door locked.

40:38.936 --> 40:42.305
No! I'm not just hiding
until this thing is over.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.942
Where am I supposed to put this?
- As soon as

40:45.977 --> 40:48.978
they get off this boat,
make sure she's ready to sail.

40:49.013 --> 40:51.414
You're acting like you know

40:51.449 --> 40:53.816
what you're doing,
but we both know you don't.

40:53.851 --> 40:56.085
All right. Fine.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.054
I have no idea what I'm
walking into out there.

40:58.089 --> 41:00.490
What other choice do I have?

41:00.525 --> 41:03.226
If you have a better plan,
I'm all ears.

41:03.261 --> 41:06.062
I'm going up there
to make sure everything

41:06.097 --> 41:08.197
goes exactly as it should.

41:08.232 --> 41:11.301
You make sure you get back here.

41:32.056 --> 41:34.490
<i>And you're sure
you don't remember Hugo, huh?</i>

41:34.525 --> 41:37.460
- I don't think so.
- No?

41:37.495 --> 41:39.795
Is he cute?

41:42.833 --> 41:44.400
Mm.

41:44.435 --> 41:46.536
No. Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

41:46.571 --> 41:48.871
Housekeeper's gonna get it.
We're good.

41:50.808 --> 41:52.942
You sure? I don't mind.

41:54.612 --> 41:56.646
I'll save you some.
- Mm.

41:56.681 --> 42:00.216
No, no, no.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.552
We're good. We're good.

42:28.679 --> 42:31.781
- What?!
- You just don't answer your phone anymore?

42:31.816 --> 42:33.649
- What do you want?
- The Tropicana Hotel

42:33.684 --> 42:35.918
is filled with cops!
And your picture

42:35.953 --> 42:38.721
is the centrepiece to whatever
sting they're running there!

42:38.756 --> 42:41.824
- Wait. What? What?
- I also found your friend Hugo.

42:41.859 --> 42:44.026
I pulled him out of the pit
at your construction site

42:44.061 --> 42:46.028
with an icepick in his head!

42:46.063 --> 42:48.197
- What are you telling me?!
- OK. OK.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.666
You need to focus. OK?
