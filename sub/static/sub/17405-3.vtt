00:10.980 --> 00:13.810
Tonight, Richard tests a van,

00:13.860 --> 00:17.290
I drive an old, brown Porsche,

00:17.340 --> 00:20.530
and James uses a telephone.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.580
Hello, everybody. Hello and welcome.

00:32.820 --> 00:35.490
Thank you so much, thank
you, everybody, thank you.

00:35.540 --> 00:37.820
Now... Now...

00:39.220 --> 00:44.010
Ambulance response times have
been in the news just recently.

00:44.060 --> 00:47.530
It seems that many ambulances
aren't getting to

00:47.580 --> 00:51.210
critically ill patients
as fast as they should be.

00:51.260 --> 00:54.010
And nobody seems to know why...

00:54.060 --> 00:55.810
except us.

00:55.860 --> 00:59.530
You see, the National Health
Service believes that this

00:59.580 --> 01:02.010
is a fast-response vehicle,

01:02.060 --> 01:06.690
but it isn't even on nodding
terms with the concept of fast.

01:06.740 --> 01:10.010
It started out in life as
a van with a diesel engine,

01:10.060 --> 01:12.810
and then they added more weight.

01:12.860 --> 01:16.490
And that gave us an idea.

01:21.940 --> 01:24.450
Here's a traditional ambulance.

01:24.500 --> 01:27.290
It's big and it's bulky

01:27.340 --> 01:30.570
and it's stuck in rush-hour traffic.

01:30.620 --> 01:34.570
Plus, it's being driven by a chap
who knows how to drain a lung,

01:34.620 --> 01:37.290
but he doesn't know
how to trail brake

01:37.340 --> 01:39.850
or execute a racing gear change.

01:39.900 --> 01:43.290
Our ambulance, however,
is really different.

01:45.180 --> 01:50.290
Yes, it's the Stig in an emergency
version of Top Gear's P45,

01:50.340 --> 01:54.460
the smallest road-legal
car ever made.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.860
That means it can fit through
the tiniest gaps.

02:00.180 --> 02:03.650
And make its own lane in the jams.

02:03.700 --> 02:07.090
And when it gets to the
scene of an emergency,

02:07.140 --> 02:11.060
it can drive right up to the
building and then go inside.

02:12.500 --> 02:17.500
All of this saves time, and
saving time saves lives.

02:18.940 --> 02:22.170
Of course, you're probably wondering
how on earth the patient can

02:22.220 --> 02:25.970
now be transported to hospital
in an ambulance as small as this.

02:26.020 --> 02:30.130
Well, that is where our genius
really comes into play because,

02:30.180 --> 02:33.610
well, here comes the Stig now
with a patient who has been

02:33.660 --> 02:36.930
literally bored into a coma by one
of the meetings they have in here.

02:36.980 --> 02:39.970
Yes, and as you can see, he simply
has to clip the stretcher

02:40.020 --> 02:42.530
on to the back of the P45
and he's ready to go.

02:42.580 --> 02:46.570
~ Yeah.
~ Sometimes I think our genius is tangible.

02:46.620 --> 02:49.650
~ It's like... it's like it has a mass.
~ Yeah, it's like another presence.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.210
It's still there when we've gone.

02:51.260 --> 02:54.050
Yeah. I mean, we've solved
many things over the years,

02:54.100 --> 02:57.130
but I think that is our
finest hour, it really is.

02:57.180 --> 03:00.050
Yeah, I think it's up there
with the best we've ever done.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.980
~ Oh!
~ Jeez!

03:04.380 --> 03:07.690
~ Oh.
~ Oh. I think we need to
call for an ambulance.

03:07.740 --> 03:10.330
~ That's a good idea.
~ OK, I'll do it.

03:10.380 --> 03:13.120
~ Do you know what the number is?
~ Nine...

03:14.180 --> 03:16.490
~ Is it nine?
~ Oh, hello.
~ Excuse me.
~ Oh...

03:16.540 --> 03:18.010
Gentlemen.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.090
"You idiots."

03:22.140 --> 03:25.730
~ Hmm. Fair point, this time.
~ Yeah.
~ "You've killed a man."

03:25.780 --> 03:28.970
~ He wasn't going to make it anyway.
~ No, I don't think he was.

03:29.020 --> 03:30.290
~ He looked very peaky.
~ He did.

03:30.340 --> 03:33.170
"It's all very well building
a faster ambulance,

03:33.220 --> 03:36.330
"but it's no good if you have
to tow the patient to hospital.

03:36.380 --> 03:40.250
"Now go back to the drawing board
and, for once, do it properly."

03:40.300 --> 03:42.170
~ Right.
~ Mm-hm, OK.

03:42.220 --> 03:44.010
So we've got to build something

03:44.060 --> 03:46.290
that's faster than
a normal ambulance.

03:46.340 --> 03:48.730
Yeah, but it's got to have
room for the patient.

03:48.780 --> 03:50.650
~ Inside it.
~ Inside it. Yeah.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.640
That's... that's where
we went wrong there.

03:54.380 --> 03:57.330
Naturally, we couldn't
agree on what vehicle

03:57.380 --> 03:59.610
we should use as a start point,

03:59.660 --> 04:02.380
so each of us went our own way.

04:09.820 --> 04:12.020
Here is what I have chosen.

04:14.380 --> 04:17.529
Yeah, it is a van,
but it's a Chevy G20.

04:17.579 --> 04:22.410
Under there, 5.7-litre
small block Chevy V8.

04:22.460 --> 04:25.210
What I've got is a V8
ambulance, but there's more.

04:25.260 --> 04:26.930
That thing, £150,000.

04:26.980 --> 04:28.970
This? About £5,000.

04:29.020 --> 04:31.610
I am saving the NHS a lot of money

04:31.660 --> 04:34.850
that they can spend better
on bandages and those...

04:34.900 --> 04:37.290
paper bottles that you wee in?

04:37.340 --> 04:40.930
At this point, the
orang-utan arrived.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.620
Hello.

04:44.660 --> 04:45.970
What?

04:47.820 --> 04:50.170
~ Well...
~ Porsche 944 Turbo.

04:50.220 --> 04:53.370
Yes, I know. It's not
very ambulance-y, is it?

04:53.420 --> 04:54.970
What's wrong with it?

04:55.020 --> 04:58.170
This was actually designed
as an ambulance by Porsche.

04:58.220 --> 05:00.930
~ Was it?
~ It was.
~ In what way is it an ambulance?

05:00.980 --> 05:02.930
~ Make that work for me.
~ Right, OK, fine.

05:02.980 --> 05:06.770
Full James May spec - brown,
brown interior, brown carpet,

05:06.820 --> 05:08.210
brown dashboard -

05:08.260 --> 05:10.930
so that if there's a trouser
accident with the patient

05:10.980 --> 05:12.530
you don't see it,

05:12.580 --> 05:15.490
and the whole point is, we were
told to get a fast ambulance,

05:15.540 --> 05:18.330
were we not? It's a 944 Turbo.

05:18.380 --> 05:21.530
Top speed 152mph.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.210
~ And this is yours?
~ Oh, yeah.

05:23.260 --> 05:26.130
~ Top speed?
~ It's so big that they won't even tell you.

05:26.180 --> 05:28.450
~ They don't even know what the top speed is.
~ Is it?

05:28.500 --> 05:31.010
~ There is no top speed.
~ Is it? Is it?
~ Yeah. Look at that.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.730
~ Ohh...
~ Yep, I know. It's brilliant, isn't it?

05:33.780 --> 05:35.410
Electric seats.

05:35.460 --> 05:39.090
Why is every single car you ever
buy for one of these challenges

05:39.140 --> 05:40.570
filled with ruched Dralon?

05:40.620 --> 05:43.050
I don't know, just something
that happens. I don't know..

05:43.100 --> 05:45.650
Now, I'm sorry, Hammond,
mine is better than yours.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.770
Look at the size of this boot!

05:47.820 --> 05:51.610
'To demonstrate its enormity,
I made Hammond climb into it.'

05:51.660 --> 05:54.330
~ It's not brilliant.
~ Tell me I've done this wrong.

05:54.380 --> 05:57.090
~ Yeah.
~ Tell me I've done this wrong.

05:57.140 --> 05:59.090
~ Um, one thing.
~ What?

05:59.140 --> 06:01.330
~ It is quite incredibly hot in here.
~ Is it?

06:01.380 --> 06:04.930
I'm in a greenhouse. I'm quite
quickly beginning to cook.

06:04.980 --> 06:06.730
'As Hammond simmered to death...'

06:06.780 --> 06:08.370
Oh, look!

06:08.420 --> 06:10.560
'..an undertaker arrived.'

06:11.460 --> 06:13.570
~ Um...
~ Oh, sorry.

06:13.620 --> 06:15.490
~ Gentlemen.
~ Oh, God!

06:16.820 --> 06:20.300
Behold, the Ford Scorpio Cardinal.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.890
So, what's really
interesting about this car

06:24.940 --> 06:26.850
is what's going on under here.

06:26.900 --> 06:33.970
This has a 2.9-litre, quad cam,
24-valve V6 developed by Cosworth

06:34.020 --> 06:37.130
and giving 207 horsepower.

06:37.180 --> 06:39.770
~ And... and it has traction control.
~ Yes...

06:39.820 --> 06:42.370
And... it has a sport button.

06:42.420 --> 06:45.370
All very interesting, James.
You did very good indeed.

06:45.420 --> 06:47.810
~ But there's a bit of
an elephant in the room.
~ Yes, I knew you

06:47.860 --> 06:50.490
were going to say that. It's not
Ford's finest styling, I know,

06:50.540 --> 06:53.010
but that hardly matters if you've
just fallen off a ladder!

06:53.060 --> 06:55.450
That's not the elephant
we're talking about.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.930
~ The elephant's a little further back.
~ It's a hearse!

06:57.980 --> 07:00.930
~ It is a hearse, James.
~ It's what you put dead people in!

07:00.980 --> 07:02.410
Well, look at it this way.

07:02.460 --> 07:06.010
If you lose the patient, which does
happen, you've still got a job.

07:06.060 --> 07:09.450
But look at the plus sides - it's
very fast, it's very smooth...

07:09.500 --> 07:12.450
~ Is it?
~ Yes, it is. It's very refined.
It's the right shape

07:12.500 --> 07:13.730
for patients already.

07:13.780 --> 07:17.210
This is a type of car that has
actually been misused for years.

07:17.260 --> 07:19.730
Tell you what it would make
- brilliant camper van.

07:19.780 --> 07:22.130
Yeah, yeah, good ice-cream
van as well.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.650
Or burger van, anything like
that, anything van-like.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.130
Yes, yes, but not an ambulance.

07:26.180 --> 07:29.570
'My protests were then halted
by the arrival of a challenge.'

07:29.620 --> 07:31.610
~ Ah.
~ Go on, then.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.450
"You will now do a drag race

07:33.500 --> 07:36.770
"with your ambulances against
the NHS equivalent."

07:36.820 --> 07:40.810
Must be that. "Many points will
be awarded to the winner."

07:40.860 --> 07:43.890
~ Well...
~ Well, I'm the winner.
~ Well...
~ Well, I...

07:43.940 --> 07:46.050
No, you parked next to...
That's a Chevy engine,

07:46.100 --> 07:48.890
that's a Corvette engine in there,
basically, as I have said.

07:48.940 --> 07:51.450
~ Shall we just do it and see?
~ Yes.
~ That's the sort of point.

07:51.500 --> 07:56.490
'Moments later, we took our
places on the start line.'

07:56.540 --> 08:00.090
Sport, traction control off,

08:00.140 --> 08:03.930
remain dignified, drive, I'm ready.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.850
Prepare to be surprised.

08:10.180 --> 08:13.730
When this car was new, it produced
217 horsepower, but today I'm not

08:13.780 --> 08:18.410
so sure because when I opened the
turbo yesterday, I found this in it.

08:18.460 --> 08:25.410
Bits of what could be gravel
or broken ceramic. I don't know.

08:25.460 --> 08:29.460
I just know it has no place in
a piece of hi-tech equipment.

08:32.020 --> 08:35.020
That's all it's got.
I'll just leave it open.

08:37.460 --> 08:40.850
Weirdest ambulance race in
history is about to begin.

08:40.900 --> 08:44.090
Three, two, one!

08:48.340 --> 08:50.490
Oh, I'm going to win!
I'm getting ahead.

08:50.540 --> 08:53.130
My mirror's dropping out.

08:53.180 --> 08:54.890
Eat my dust, Chevrolet!

08:54.940 --> 08:57.100
Oh, my God, no!

09:00.540 --> 09:02.780
The hearse is mighty.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.650
Look at it go! 100!

09:07.700 --> 09:09.610
But it seems, yes...

09:09.660 --> 09:11.690
Oh, no!

09:11.740 --> 09:15.020
..the Porsche is mightier
than the hearse.

09:17.900 --> 09:21.980
And across the line at 120mph!

09:25.740 --> 09:27.810
The A-Team had one of these!

09:27.860 --> 09:31.460
Hammond, my commiserations
on your unfortunate loss.

09:32.580 --> 09:34.170
Thank you.

09:34.220 --> 09:36.050
'The fact is, though,

09:36.100 --> 09:40.050
'that all our vehicles were faster
than the National Health Service,

09:40.100 --> 09:41.890
'and having proved that,

09:41.940 --> 09:46.300
'we were told to go off and make
them a bit more ambulance-y.'

09:48.620 --> 09:50.860
Thank you very much.

09:51.980 --> 09:53.850
Thank you very much.

09:55.420 --> 09:59.490
Now, we're going to pick that up...
We'll pick that up later on,

09:59.540 --> 10:02.810
but just before we move on and
do the news, can I just say,

10:02.860 --> 10:06.290
if you're standing in a
field with a severed arm,

10:06.340 --> 10:08.970
you don't want the NHS
to arrive in a diesel van.

10:09.020 --> 10:11.410
You don't want someone
coming in a hearse.

10:11.460 --> 10:12.890
It's a Cosworth hearse.

10:12.940 --> 10:16.370
I don't care if it's a Bugatti
hearse, it's still a hearse.

10:16.420 --> 10:19.490
And what it says to the patient
is, "You're not going to make it."

10:19.540 --> 10:21.450
It does, James. It does.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.410
But the point I'm trying to make
is this, OK, not only are you

10:24.460 --> 10:27.850
bothered about what car they
come in, but also the driver.

10:27.900 --> 10:30.410
You don't want to be rescued
by Josh out of Casualty.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.010
You want Lewis Hamilton.

10:32.060 --> 10:34.970
~ Now, that is a good point, actually.
~ Yes, it is.

10:35.020 --> 10:38.770
It is because, if you think about
it, racing drivers are like actors.

10:38.820 --> 10:41.450
At any given moment, 97%
of them are out of work.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.770
So why doesn't the NHS take them on?

10:43.820 --> 10:45.690
They could be doing something useful.

10:45.740 --> 10:47.850
And what's Nigel Mansell
doing these days?

10:47.900 --> 10:50.410
Cos he'd be a brilliant
ambulance driver,

10:50.460 --> 10:53.250
~ wouldn't he?
~ He would.
~ With his comforting Brummie accent

10:53.300 --> 10:56.050
and his reassuring moustache
in the front of the ambulance.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.970
~ I'd love to know he was there.
~ Anyway, we must now do the news.

10:59.020 --> 11:00.570
And, uh, oh, yes,

11:00.620 --> 11:03.330
we've had a number of complaints
about last week's show.

11:03.380 --> 11:06.130
People said it was cruel
to blow up a cow.

11:06.180 --> 11:10.250
Well, I want to make it
absolutely plain right now -

11:10.300 --> 11:14.170
no cow was hurt in the
making of that film.

11:14.220 --> 11:16.530
~ Its death was instantaneous.
~ Yeah.

11:16.580 --> 11:19.490
~ Wouldn't have felt a thing.
~ Immediate, it wouldn't have known.

11:19.540 --> 11:24.370
~ Right, next.
~ Yes, I have news, very exciting
news. It is a new Ferrari.

11:24.420 --> 11:27.610
~ There is a picture of it here. That...
~ Holy Moley!

11:27.660 --> 11:29.530
~ Wow.
~ Yes indeed.

11:29.580 --> 11:31.730
That is the 488 GTB.

11:31.780 --> 11:35.570
It has a 3.9-litre turbo-charged V8,

11:35.620 --> 11:39.490
661 horsepower, 0-60 in
three seconds. Look at it.

11:39.540 --> 11:42.770
Correct me if I'm wrong, this is the
replacement, isn't it, for the 458?

11:42.820 --> 11:45.410
~ Yes, it is.
~ I'm just thinking, if you had a 458,

11:45.460 --> 11:47.250
you'd be feeling suicidal now,

11:47.300 --> 11:50.170
~ wouldn't you?
~ Yeah, you would. Yeah.
~ That's prettier,

11:50.220 --> 11:54.370
faster, it's turbo-charged, it
does 25 miles to the gallon.

11:54.420 --> 11:57.290
50% more downforce than the 458.

11:57.340 --> 12:00.490
~ Yeah.
~ Yeah, yeah.
~ James?
~ Yes, Richard?

12:00.540 --> 12:05.330
~ Haven't you got a 458?
~ Oh, I completely forgot.
~ Yes, I have.

12:05.380 --> 12:07.250
It's worthless now,

12:07.300 --> 12:09.450
literally worthless,
now they've done that.

12:09.500 --> 12:13.210
You might just want to give it away
to a member of the audience here.

12:13.260 --> 12:15.290
Yeah!

12:15.340 --> 12:17.690
~ It's worthless.
~ I think we should maybe put it...

12:17.740 --> 12:19.610
Let's open it to all the viewers.

12:19.660 --> 12:23.090
If you'd like James's Ferrari
write to us at James May,

12:23.140 --> 12:26.330
I'll Take That Ferrari
Off Your Hands If I Must,

12:26.380 --> 12:29.450
BBC, London... wherever we are.

12:29.500 --> 12:34.010
~ You know, people are actually
going to write in now.
~ Yes.

12:34.060 --> 12:36.330
And we're actually
going to give it away.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.210
Yeah, we are. We're committed now.

12:38.260 --> 12:40.090
That is a thing of
extraordinary beauty.

12:40.140 --> 12:42.410
But I have to say this -
McLaren quick to respond,

12:42.460 --> 12:44.490
they also have announced a new car.

12:44.540 --> 12:47.050
Can't remember what it's
called, it doesn't matter.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.970
They sent us a picture
of it. Here it is.

12:50.940 --> 12:53.730
I'm not actually joking. They
genuinely sent that going,

12:53.780 --> 12:56.250
~ "We've got a new car."
~ It's not actually a car, is it?

12:56.300 --> 12:57.850
~ Not really, no.
~ It's not finished.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.810
I think I prefer the Ferrari.

12:59.860 --> 13:03.450
Now, I want to talk
about immigration,

13:03.500 --> 13:07.330
and as I said that, the
entire BBC management team

13:07.380 --> 13:10.490
sat bolt upright in their
sitting rooms and went,

13:10.540 --> 13:12.690
"Oh, no, where's he going with this?"

13:12.740 --> 13:14.410
Well, relax, LADIES,

13:14.460 --> 13:16.530
don't choke on your tofu.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.730
All I want to say is,
if you are an immigrant,

13:21.780 --> 13:24.050
you've just arrived
in Britain, welcome.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.450
Make yourselves at home. We
hope you're very happy here.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.250
Yeah, absolutely, we mean this.
Thank you for coming here,

13:29.300 --> 13:31.850
thank you for working hard,
thank you for paying taxes,

13:31.900 --> 13:33.410
thank you for cleaning my car.

13:33.460 --> 13:37.370
And we're off the air. That's the
end of that. It's been great.

13:37.420 --> 13:40.930
No, the man who runs the
car valeting place near me

13:40.980 --> 13:43.290
has recently arrived from
Albania and he's brilliant.

13:43.340 --> 13:45.970
No-one else is going to do it.
He is superb, that's what I meant,

13:46.020 --> 13:48.650
~ thank you very much.
~ Fair enough. Well done, James.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.410
What I wanted to say is,

13:50.460 --> 13:53.410
I've noticed this, driving around
in Britain, OK, I've noticed

13:53.460 --> 13:56.290
a lot of the new boys, people
who've just arrived in Britain,

13:56.340 --> 13:58.730
have to understand how you
use the motorways here -

13:58.780 --> 14:02.090
that the right-hand lane, the outside
lane, is for overtaking -

14:02.140 --> 14:04.610
and then when you've completed
your overtaking,

14:04.660 --> 14:07.530
you then move back into the
two inside lanes again.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.970
I'm just passing that on
as a piece of information.

14:10.020 --> 14:11.970
Cos that's how it
works here, exactly.

14:12.020 --> 14:14.450
~ Think of that right-hand
lane as the lavatory.
~ Yeah.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.610
You go in, do what you've got to
do, and then you come out again.

14:17.660 --> 14:19.730
You don't stay in there all day.

14:19.780 --> 14:22.650
Unless you're James May, then
I don't know what you're doing.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.530
But, actually, seriously,
you can't blame people

14:25.580 --> 14:27.090
for not necessarily knowing that.

14:27.140 --> 14:29.090
If you move to a completely
different country,

14:29.140 --> 14:31.850
there's a lot of stuff that you
don't know that you have to learn.

14:31.900 --> 14:35.170
Exactly. We travel an awful
lot, as I'm sure you know.

14:35.220 --> 14:38.290
I mean, in India, for example,
if you're behind a lorry

14:38.340 --> 14:42.130
and it indicates right, that means,
"I have seen you in my mirrors,

14:42.180 --> 14:45.170
"do please feel free to overtake,"

14:45.220 --> 14:47.610
OR it means, "I'm turning right."

14:47.660 --> 14:48.850
Yeah, it does.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.770
And if only there'd been a motoring
show that would've told us

14:51.820 --> 14:53.730
when we got there that
that's what it means.

14:53.780 --> 14:55.610
~ It's a valuable service.
~ Yeah, exactly.

14:55.660 --> 14:59.290
Because in Burma, for example,
if you turn your headlights off,

14:59.340 --> 15:01.690
~ that means it's night-time.
~ Mmm.

15:01.740 --> 15:03.970
There's lots and lots of
different little nuances

15:04.020 --> 15:05.450
when you're driving on the road.

15:05.500 --> 15:09.090
There's another one in Britain,
for people who've just got here.

15:09.140 --> 15:11.850
If you're stopped by the
police for any reason,

15:11.900 --> 15:13.730
it's traditional in Britain

15:13.780 --> 15:17.570
~ to cup the officer's
face and kiss him lightly.
~ Yeah, yeah.

15:17.620 --> 15:20.570
And, quite often, you'll find
he'll give you a traditional

15:20.620 --> 15:22.570
little friendly punch in the face.

15:22.620 --> 15:25.810
And maybe a jovial little tase
along with it. It's just...

15:25.860 --> 15:30.290
I think what we're trying to say
is, get out of the outside lane!

15:30.340 --> 15:34.770
Oh, now! There's a new special
edition of the Range Rover Evoque,

15:34.820 --> 15:37.890
~ it's called the NW8.
~ NW8?
~ Yes. There it is.

15:37.940 --> 15:40.530
They've named it after
a London postcode?

15:40.580 --> 15:43.570
Yeah, next up probably
will be the E17.

15:43.620 --> 15:46.930
A car that runs over its own driver.

15:51.420 --> 15:55.290
~ What's the matter now?
~ I don't get that.

15:55.340 --> 15:58.210
~ East 17...
~ It's a postcode. Why would a postcode...

15:58.260 --> 16:02.010
~ How could a postcode...
~ East 17 is a band, Brian Harvey?

16:02.060 --> 16:04.660
~ Is he a driver?
~ No, Hammond, look...

16:05.300 --> 16:08.210
Hammond... Basically, the only
band he knows is the Wurzels.

16:08.260 --> 16:11.650
That's the problem. Now, I want
to talk about stopping distances,

16:11.700 --> 16:14.250
we touched on this when we
were in Australia last week.

16:14.300 --> 16:18.090
You see, the Government says
we have to be limited to 70mph

16:18.140 --> 16:23.050
on the motorway because the stopping
distance from 70 is 315 feet,

16:23.100 --> 16:25.810
which they say that's an
acceptable stopping distance

16:25.860 --> 16:28.370
so therefore you can't
go any faster than 70.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.610
Exactly. But we know that
it isn't 315, don't we,

16:30.660 --> 16:33.010
because we demonstrated this
in Australia last week.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.050
Well, from 60, yes.
But we made the point.

16:35.100 --> 16:38.130
So what we were wondering
is, how fast do you actually

16:38.180 --> 16:42.050
have to be going before
you need 315 feet to stop?

16:42.100 --> 16:44.650
Mmm. So we actually decided,
this morning in fact,

16:44.700 --> 16:46.050
to do an experiment.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.690
We've got footage of it here.

16:47.740 --> 16:52.250
It's the Stig driving along in a
diesel-powered Vauxhall Insignia.

16:52.300 --> 16:55.930
And he's building up speed to
brake point now, full braking

16:55.980 --> 16:57.610
and that's the Stig doing it.

16:57.660 --> 17:00.770
And there we are, 315 feet exactly.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.250
Anyone want to guess
how fast he was going

17:03.300 --> 17:05.010
when he pressed the brake pedal?

17:05.060 --> 17:07.490
100mph?

17:07.540 --> 17:10.849
130 in a Vauxhall Insignia diesel?

17:10.900 --> 17:13.250
No. Try to be realistic.

17:13.300 --> 17:17.450
110? actually he was doing 112mph.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.890
So if the Government says
that the speed limit is

17:19.940 --> 17:21.930
determined by stopping distance,

17:21.980 --> 17:25.210
then we should be allowed
to drive at 112mph.

17:25.260 --> 17:28.200
~ Perfectly logical.
~ You can't argue with it.

17:29.980 --> 17:32.410
It's logic.

17:32.460 --> 17:35.290
Right, OK. Now it's time to get
back to our ambulance film.

17:35.340 --> 17:37.890
So far, we've established
that my car, his van

17:37.940 --> 17:40.490
and his hearse are faster
than the NHS equivalent,

17:40.540 --> 17:43.370
and now we pick up the action
after we've converted them

17:43.420 --> 17:45.420
into actual ambulances.

17:49.740 --> 17:52.570
We reconvened once more at our track,

17:52.620 --> 17:55.340
and James was the first to arrive.

17:59.620 --> 18:04.090
Hello, viewers, and as you would
expect, I have done it properly.

18:04.140 --> 18:05.970
This is no longer a hearse,

18:06.020 --> 18:09.620
it is the future of club
class recovery transport.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.930
I've based it all on
business jet travel.

18:12.980 --> 18:15.890
It goes fast and makes
you feel better.

18:15.940 --> 18:18.930
Choice of pillows, television
to show your journey.

18:18.980 --> 18:21.490
A lovely view to the top. A lovely
view out of the windows.

18:21.540 --> 18:24.010
What could be wrong with it?
It is the perfect ambulance.

18:24.060 --> 18:27.170
I don't know why nobody's thought
of it before, to be brutally honest.

18:27.220 --> 18:29.650
~ James May!
~ Oh, crikey.

18:29.700 --> 18:35.410
Prepare to be blown away by the
turbulence of my magnificence!

18:35.460 --> 18:37.250
Behold, look what I have done!

18:37.300 --> 18:40.690
I'm prepared to bask in the fetid
belch of his incompetence,

18:40.740 --> 18:43.080
but, anyway, let's see. Hello.

18:44.340 --> 18:49.460
The challenge, as you know,
was to build a fast ambulance.

18:51.140 --> 18:54.770
~ I've added 300 horsepower...
~ Have you?
~ .. with the paint job.

18:54.820 --> 18:57.570
~ Right.
~ You'll notice...

18:57.620 --> 19:00.330
~ hydraulic handbrake.
~ Hydraulic handbrake?

19:00.380 --> 19:03.090
~ Hydraulic handbrake.
~ You often hear ambulance drivers saying,

19:03.140 --> 19:05.130
"If only I'd had a
hydraulic handbrake."

19:05.180 --> 19:08.050
You've never heard them say that
cos they've never thought of it.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.490
~ OK.
~ Telephone number.

19:09.540 --> 19:12.170
Yes, telephone number. That
works everywhere, doesn't it?

19:12.220 --> 19:14.850
~ That's good, I can see the performance.
~ Yes. Yes.

19:14.900 --> 19:17.410
~ That? ~ This?
~ Yeah. ~ This?
~ Yeah.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.770
This is genius. No other word for it.

19:19.820 --> 19:23.290
'But before I could explain,
Hammond arrived.'

19:26.020 --> 19:27.370
Oh, my God.

19:27.420 --> 19:29.020
Oh, yeah.

19:32.460 --> 19:34.450
Ambulance.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.970
It doesn't say...

19:36.020 --> 19:40.970
No, what it says is "lo-cost nuclear
waste disposal", not "ambulance".

19:41.020 --> 19:43.650
No, what it says is,
"Get out of the way!"

19:43.700 --> 19:46.570
Because you would. You see that,
you're not going to just sit there

19:46.620 --> 19:49.130
dithering, "Oh, I might, I might
not." You're going to run.

19:49.180 --> 19:51.970
~ What's this?
~ Well, if you're stuck
in traffic, for instance,

19:52.020 --> 19:54.490
and you saw this, and green
gas started coming out,

19:54.540 --> 19:57.810
~ you wouldn't be stuck in traffic any more.
~ So, you're scaring people

19:57.860 --> 20:00.530
out of the way of your
high-performance ambulance?

20:00.580 --> 20:02.570
~ Yes!
~ Ah, but it isn't high performance.
~ No.

20:02.620 --> 20:05.290
~ That's what I'm about to say.
~ Uh, uh, uh!
~ Is it any faster?

20:05.340 --> 20:08.170
Yes, I have addressed the issue
of speed very cleverly.

20:08.220 --> 20:10.610
What I've fitted...

20:10.660 --> 20:13.530
If you look over there - nitrous!

20:13.580 --> 20:15.490
Because it has two purposes.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.970
It's what they use as laughing
gas in hospitals, isn't it?

20:18.020 --> 20:20.530
~ Yes.
~ So, if the patient needs to
be made to feel a bit better,

20:20.580 --> 20:22.090
I switch that to "patient".

20:22.140 --> 20:25.090
If I want to go a bit faster,
I switch that to "engine"

20:25.140 --> 20:28.570
and it diverts the nitrous into the
engine, another several hundred BHP.

20:28.620 --> 20:31.610
~ Of course!
~ Yes!
~ Nitrous is the same thing
that drag racers use

20:31.660 --> 20:34.660
~ to go faster and that they use...
~ Yeah, yeah.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.930
'James then demonstrated
the motorised loading bay

20:39.980 --> 20:42.580
'he'd fitted to his hearse-bulance.'

20:45.180 --> 20:47.530
~ Oh, the speed, the speed!
~ I'm bleed....

20:47.580 --> 20:50.450
~ It's my femoral artery! I'm bleeding out.
~ We're bleeding to death!

20:50.500 --> 20:52.850
It's slowing now, it's
not bleeding as quickly.

20:52.900 --> 20:55.290
It's barely dribbling out now!

20:55.340 --> 20:57.970
It's a good job you've got
a Cosworth engine, James,

20:58.020 --> 21:01.090
~ because you've got a lot of time to make up.
~ Can we have a look inside?

21:01.140 --> 21:04.210
~ Of course you can.
~ Oh, look it...

21:05.740 --> 21:08.890
~ You've broken it.
~ It won't take the weight
of a tiny, tiny man.

21:08.940 --> 21:13.340
'I then demonstrated my much faster
patient-loading solution.'

21:16.620 --> 21:19.690
~ Oh, I say!
~ Wheels deployed.

21:19.740 --> 21:22.530
Wheels deployed there,
wheels deploy there.

21:22.580 --> 21:25.610
Ouch! Annoyingly, that's
actually quite clever.

21:25.660 --> 21:28.530
~ This is a split folding...
It's like a Range Rover Porsche.
~ Exactly!

21:28.580 --> 21:31.770
Don't sit it on it, you've already
broken one tailgate today.

21:31.820 --> 21:35.120
'And my brilliant engineering
didn't stop there.'

21:35.780 --> 21:38.770
I'm driving down a narrow street,

21:38.820 --> 21:42.320
parked cars are on either
side, I can't get through.

21:43.620 --> 21:45.220
~ Clear!
~ What?!

21:49.220 --> 21:52.810
~ What?
~ It's a ram-bulance!

21:52.860 --> 21:56.610
~ Oh, I see, I thought it was a snowplough.
~ My God, this is...

21:56.660 --> 21:58.890
~ Sheet steel, ten mil.
~ OK.

22:00.860 --> 22:04.210
~ Heavy?
~ Very.
~ Hmm.
~ That's why it folds back.

22:04.260 --> 22:07.370
~ Oh, what, cos it's lighter
when it's folded back?
~ No, no, no, no, b...

22:07.420 --> 22:10.370
~ Do you know nothing about
weight distribution?
~ 50-50 distribution.

22:10.420 --> 22:12.050
~ It's still weight!
~ It's 50-50...

22:12.100 --> 22:16.090
'As we discussed my handiwork,
a challenge arrived.'

22:18.340 --> 22:21.610
"The Stig will now drive each
of your cars around the track,

22:21.660 --> 22:26.730
"which, to make it more real, has
been fitted with three speed humps.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.890
"You will be in the
back with a patient

22:28.940 --> 22:32.650
"and, in the course of one lap, you
will put his intestines back in,

22:32.700 --> 22:35.130
"insert a drip, and fit a catheter.

22:35.180 --> 22:36.890
"Points will be awarded for speed

22:36.940 --> 22:40.410
"and how much of the medical
work you complete successfully."

22:40.460 --> 22:43.730
What? Is a catheter a thing
that goes up your old chap?

22:43.780 --> 22:46.530
~ Yes! ~ Up it?
~ Yes. ~ Not on it?
~ No.

22:49.100 --> 22:53.610
'Hammond elected to go first and,
once his patient had been loaded,

22:53.660 --> 22:57.450
'a rather bemused Stig took
his place at the wheel.'

22:57.500 --> 22:59.810
~ Oh, he's not in a good way at all.
~ He?!

22:59.860 --> 23:02.370
~ It's a girl.
~ Oh, yeah.
~ Oh, no, or is it, though?

23:02.420 --> 23:05.250
It's a girl from where I am.
Just have a look under there.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.450
~ Is that just a bit of...?
~ Agh!

23:07.500 --> 23:09.890
~ There's a thing!
~ It's a ladyboy!

23:09.940 --> 23:11.770
Anyway, it's a medical emergency.

23:11.820 --> 23:15.120
Get out of the way, I've
got to get on with this.

23:15.980 --> 23:19.610
In three, two, one...

23:19.660 --> 23:21.490
Go!

23:21.540 --> 23:25.900
Oh-ho! Oh, that's... Yeah, ugh!
The wheels were a mistake!

23:27.500 --> 23:31.610
I'm really sorry, mate, just try
and put your guts back in the...

23:31.660 --> 23:33.650
Oh... er... Agh!

23:37.220 --> 23:39.970
Airway - that's a priority!
That goes in here.

23:40.020 --> 23:42.210
Agh! Now he's being sick on me!

23:42.260 --> 23:44.200
I'm covered in... Agh!

23:46.980 --> 23:49.650
Stop vomiting, you idiot!

23:49.700 --> 23:52.090
Agh! Oh!

23:52.140 --> 23:55.890
This is the willy bit. You probably
can't see this on television.

23:55.940 --> 23:58.210
This has to go in the end.

23:58.260 --> 24:00.860
Ah! Now I'm covered in wee!

24:02.860 --> 24:04.370
Agh, agh, ah!

24:04.420 --> 24:05.610
Oof!

24:05.660 --> 24:07.290
Speed...

24:07.340 --> 24:08.900
Ah! Agh!

24:10.900 --> 24:14.730
~ That would be deeply
uncomfortable for Hammond.
~ I would've thought so.

24:17.180 --> 24:19.920
How do I get the blood
out of the bag?

24:22.380 --> 24:24.890
~ I'm tempted to move back.
~ Do you know? I agree.

24:24.940 --> 24:26.130
~ Yeah.
~ Cos it is Das Stig!

24:26.180 --> 24:27.570
Agh!

24:27.620 --> 24:28.850
Stig!

24:28.900 --> 24:30.690
Whoa!

24:30.740 --> 24:32.290
There he is.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.570
Across the line!

24:34.620 --> 24:37.490
'The 2 minutes 17 lap
had taken its toll

24:37.540 --> 24:41.050
'on both the Chevy's
brakes and Dr Hammond.'

24:41.100 --> 24:45.010
Holy Moley! Look at the
state of him. What's that?

24:45.060 --> 24:48.010
~ Being an ambulance man is a tough job.
~ What is that?!

24:48.060 --> 24:50.860
~ It's...it's wee.
~ Is it yours?
~ No.

24:52.100 --> 24:55.450
'Next, it was the turn of
Dr Slow's hearse-bulance.'

24:55.500 --> 24:58.170
Three, two, one, go!

25:03.060 --> 25:06.370
~ Should I start the stopwatch now?
~ Well, I mean, this is part of the...

25:06.420 --> 25:08.420
Well, it's taking time.

25:10.860 --> 25:13.330
~ Is his seat fastened down?
~ Yeah.

25:13.380 --> 25:16.580
What he's done is take a length
of one of those stairlifts.

25:24.180 --> 25:26.450
I think you may have
overdone it slightly

25:26.500 --> 25:28.170
on closing the tailgate, Stig.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.050
You get in and we'll fasten you in.

25:30.100 --> 25:32.250
Your lap time is going
to be shocking, frankly.

25:32.300 --> 25:34.690
~ You haven't started the stopwatch?
~ Yeah.
~ Course we have!

25:34.740 --> 25:39.410
~ I haven't set off yet!
~ You DID set off!
~ Well, it's your call, isn't it?

25:39.460 --> 25:40.770
Hurry up!

25:40.820 --> 25:41.960
Go!

25:43.940 --> 25:45.570
~ He's gone!
~ He's gone now.

25:45.620 --> 25:48.850
~ 9 minutes 30 to get to there.
~ 9.30!
~ That's not brilliant.

25:48.900 --> 25:52.650
Can you hear me, man, woman? No?
Right, breathing? Possibly not.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.170
Putting...

25:55.140 --> 25:58.460
'The hearse-bulance coped
brilliantly with the corners.'

25:59.540 --> 26:01.210
That's his guts back in.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.800
'But less well on the speed humps.'

26:08.420 --> 26:09.700
Ow!

26:11.380 --> 26:12.900
Keep going!

26:15.900 --> 26:17.210
He's going to make it!

26:17.260 --> 26:19.420
Here he comes.

26:20.700 --> 26:24.690
~ Hammond, run for your life!
~ I'm going to die! Killed by an ambulance!

26:24.740 --> 26:26.480
Across the line!

26:27.180 --> 26:30.410
'James wasn't best pleased
with his lap time.'

26:30.460 --> 26:34.090
~ 12 minutes and 28 seconds!
~ Oh, get lost!
~ It was!
~ It was.

26:34.140 --> 26:37.090
It's the slowest lap
in Top Gear's history.

26:37.140 --> 26:39.570
'Finally, it was the
turn of the Porsche.

26:39.620 --> 26:41.610
'And immediately, there
was a problem.'

26:41.660 --> 26:43.020
Ah!

26:44.420 --> 26:46.570
~ Good.
~ He's kicked the patient.

26:46.620 --> 26:49.490
Um...

26:49.540 --> 26:50.850
Shut up!

26:50.900 --> 26:54.210
'Eventually, though, the
ape was in position.'

26:54.260 --> 26:55.860
Begin!

26:58.220 --> 27:01.130
Is he focusing on
getting the drip in?

27:01.180 --> 27:03.250
Or is he focusing on...?

27:04.180 --> 27:08.410
♪ Trust in me, trust in me... ♪

27:08.460 --> 27:10.010
Oh...!

27:10.060 --> 27:12.660
Holy mother of God!

27:17.780 --> 27:20.260
Ow! It hurts so much!

27:23.900 --> 27:25.370
You maniac!

27:27.060 --> 27:29.140
Ow! Stupid man!

27:30.700 --> 27:33.730
Oh, God, what happens when
I go over a speed bump?!

27:33.780 --> 27:35.690
I don't like this!

27:37.940 --> 27:39.740
Ooh...!

27:43.300 --> 27:45.050
Here he comes.

27:45.100 --> 27:48.060
I'm in a scene from Carrie!

27:49.460 --> 27:51.820
I want Josh back from Casualty!

27:52.820 --> 27:54.020
God!

27:56.620 --> 27:58.650
And across the line!

27:58.700 --> 28:00.170
Oh?!

28:00.220 --> 28:02.090
Oh, dear!

28:02.140 --> 28:05.810
'And then, to complete
my humiliation...'

28:05.860 --> 28:07.890
2... 24.

28:07.940 --> 28:11.250
~ Rubbish! What, I was slower than the...?
~ Yeah!

28:11.300 --> 28:14.490
~ You were 2.12 or something, weren't you?
~ Yep.

28:14.540 --> 28:17.250
~ Did he slow down at all for the speed humps?
~ Nope.

28:17.300 --> 28:19.690
That's why we got air.

28:19.740 --> 28:24.130
~ Right, that's my drawback.
~ Well, you can't... I mean, it's a Porsche!

28:24.180 --> 28:26.650
You can't hit the sp... It
hasn't got the clearance!

28:26.700 --> 28:30.650
~ He ripped his bumper off.
~ Speed bumps! 600,000 people a year

28:30.700 --> 28:33.210
are killed in the back of
ambulances by speed humps.

28:33.260 --> 28:36.490
~ What you're doing is making that up.
~ Yes, but making a point as well.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.330
~ I'm making it up to make a point.
~ If it's one or more, it's an issue.

28:39.380 --> 28:41.650
~ Agreed!
~ Go over it too fast, patient dies.
~ Yeah?

28:41.700 --> 28:43.210
Slow down to make it comfortable,

28:43.260 --> 28:46.010
patient dies cos they don't
reach the hospital in time.

28:46.060 --> 28:49.490
Until this Government gets rid
of every single speed hump,

28:49.540 --> 28:51.660
we're all going to die.

28:53.300 --> 28:56.170
'For our next test, we had
to see which of our cars

28:56.220 --> 28:59.410
'had the fastest patient
off-loading system.'

28:59.460 --> 29:04.650
As I approach the A & E department,
I open the boot using electricity.

29:04.700 --> 29:09.090
I then apply the handbrake,
hydraulic, the car swings round,

29:09.140 --> 29:13.810
centrifugal force causes the patient
to leave the car, the ambulance,

29:13.860 --> 29:18.650
on his stretcher, the wheels deploy,
and he rolls into the hospital.

29:18.700 --> 29:21.250
I am then pointing
in the right direction

29:21.300 --> 29:24.060
to go back out and
get another patient.

29:25.340 --> 29:28.250
Somewhere, there's a world
in which that will work.

29:28.300 --> 29:33.340
Ram-bulance 1 coming in hot.
Delivery system engaged!

29:34.380 --> 29:36.180
Behold my genius.

29:40.940 --> 29:44.810
~ Not an enormous success.
~ No, I could see where
the thinking was going...

29:44.860 --> 29:47.570
~ Yeah.
~ .. but the legs didn't deploy
and the patient's dead.

29:47.620 --> 29:51.810
~ Goal-line technology, that is in.
~ I'm going to give it a no,

29:51.860 --> 29:55.890
~ on the basis that he isn't IN the hospital.
~ He is!
~ He's not!
~ He is!

29:55.940 --> 29:57.850
~ The hos...
~ Even his foot's not in, he's not in.

29:57.900 --> 30:00.730
Nobody will look at it and say, "Ooh,
that poor man's in hospital."

30:00.780 --> 30:04.210
They'll say, "That poor man's
been dumped OUTSIDE a hospital."

30:04.260 --> 30:06.130
'It was then my turn.'

30:06.180 --> 30:07.850
Swing it round.

30:08.820 --> 30:09.970
What is he doing?!

30:10.020 --> 30:12.410
Similar sort of system,
only I'm using a cannon.

30:12.460 --> 30:14.660
And, er, ready? Good, fire!

30:17.340 --> 30:19.880
Pretty quick, I think you'll agree.

30:21.020 --> 30:24.930
~ What?
~ What the hell was that?!
~ I'm not entirely certain

30:24.980 --> 30:28.170
~ you've delivered the
patient to the hospital.
~ Well, I have!

30:28.220 --> 30:32.010
Or that the patient is still...
What's the word I'm looking for?

30:32.060 --> 30:34.940
~ .. alive!
~ That's the one.
~ Ooh! Oh, dear!

30:36.220 --> 30:37.690
It was an air cannon.

30:37.740 --> 30:40.410
Oh, and the door didn't
open properly.

30:40.460 --> 30:43.210
'Given how low the
bar had been set...'

30:43.260 --> 30:44.650
I think it was a good idea.

30:44.700 --> 30:47.440
'.. I was confident
that I'd win this.'

30:49.620 --> 30:53.210
~ James, what exactly are we looking at?
~ This is a robot lawnmower.

30:53.260 --> 30:55.290
~ Is it?
~ I've laid out pieces of string.

30:55.340 --> 31:00.610
It knows where those are, so it mows
only inside this big rectangle.

31:00.660 --> 31:04.010
So then I thought, you know the
really big farm lawnmowers?

31:04.060 --> 31:08.170
~ You mean combines?
~ Yeah, whatever, those work off satnav.

31:08.220 --> 31:11.490
The satnav knows where it is, and
that's the technology I've used.

31:11.540 --> 31:16.460
'We watched eagerly as James lined
up to demonstrate his invention.'

31:17.780 --> 31:20.260
Oh, God!

31:22.000 --> 31:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

31:37.180 --> 31:38.250
Right.

31:38.300 --> 31:41.610
Now all I do is, using my special
programmer, I have the coordinates

31:41.660 --> 31:44.690
for the operating theatre at
this hospital already entered.

31:47.220 --> 31:48.700
Now watch.

31:53.100 --> 31:55.770
~ Stand clear.
~ What? So you uploaded

31:55.820 --> 32:00.490
the schematics to your PDA of
the hospital, like Jack Bauer?

32:00.540 --> 32:02.650
What does that mean?

32:02.700 --> 32:04.730
Arrived at the operating theatre.

32:04.780 --> 32:06.250
~ Does it?
~ Yes.

32:06.300 --> 32:10.170
~ In some ways, I'm very impressed
with what he's done.
~ Yeah.

32:10.220 --> 32:14.210
But in one colossal way...

32:14.260 --> 32:17.450
.. I'm not sure that
it's worked at all.

32:17.500 --> 32:20.370
I know what that way is,
and I think you're right.

32:20.420 --> 32:23.170
It is a disadvantage of the
system. It's a problem.

32:23.220 --> 32:25.410
James, would you like to
know what the massive...

32:25.460 --> 32:29.160
~ What?
~ If you insist there's
something wrong with it...

32:30.060 --> 32:33.770
Yeah. Maybe your patient
changed his mind(!)

32:38.580 --> 32:41.570
Thank you so much, everybody.
Now, we'll pick that up...

32:41.620 --> 32:43.130
We'll pick that up later on.

32:43.180 --> 32:47.650
Uh, but now, it is time to put a
Star in our Reasonably Priced Car.

32:47.700 --> 32:51.810
My guest tonight is a Formula One
driver who is always smiling.

32:51.860 --> 32:54.650
But he says that, behind
the cuddly exterior,

32:54.700 --> 32:57.010
he's actually a bit
of a honey badger.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.410
A ferocious animal

32:58.460 --> 33:00.930
that fights its opponents
by going for their...

33:00.980 --> 33:02.530
crotch areas.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.890
Er... so, ladies and gentlemen,

33:04.940 --> 33:09.450
please put your hands over your
genitals for Daniel Ricciardo!

33:11.180 --> 33:12.610
Hey!

33:14.260 --> 33:17.340
~ G'day.
~ How are you?
~ I'm all right.

33:18.820 --> 33:20.970
Yes!

33:21.020 --> 33:23.760
People love it when
an F1 driver comes.

33:25.180 --> 33:28.570
It was weird, we were in Australia
last week in the Northern Territory,

33:28.620 --> 33:31.610
saw no Australians at all,
and now there's one here!

33:31.660 --> 33:34.130
~ Yeah, I know.
~ But then, you're ALL over here, actually,

33:34.180 --> 33:35.650
if we're honest, aren't you?

33:35.700 --> 33:37.690
Well, not by choice.

33:41.100 --> 33:44.410
I can feel the warmth
you're generating now(!)

33:44.460 --> 33:46.610
No, um, what I wanted to do is,

33:46.660 --> 33:50.290
obviously, when you started at
Red Bull last year, did you think,

33:50.340 --> 33:51.690
and I know a lot of people did,

33:51.740 --> 33:54.410
that you'd be the cheerful
Aussie playing second fiddle

33:54.460 --> 33:56.970
to the four-times world
champion Sebastian Vettel?

33:57.020 --> 33:58.370
~ No.
~ You didn't?

33:58.420 --> 34:02.170
So you actually thought, from the
get-go, "I'm going to have him"?

34:02.220 --> 34:05.450
I believed I'd have
him. But, er... yeah.

34:05.500 --> 34:08.290
Until I got on track, and had
everything like for like,

34:08.340 --> 34:10.969
I wasn't obviously sure how it
would go, but coming into it,

34:11.020 --> 34:14.489
I didn't expect to be, you know,
the guy following him every weekend.

34:14.540 --> 34:17.250
You know, I obviously came
in with some self belief

34:17.300 --> 34:21.530
and then I think that sort of showed
and then confidence grew after that.

34:21.580 --> 34:25.170
There were 19 races last year
and you beat him in how many?

34:25.219 --> 34:26.850
~ I don't know, er...
~ I do.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.730
How many was it?

34:28.780 --> 34:32.370
~ 14 of them.
~ 14?
~ Don't pretend you didn't know!

34:32.420 --> 34:34.730
No, I-I didn't really, actually.

34:34.780 --> 34:37.210
I knew it was more, like
I knew I had more than him.

34:37.260 --> 34:38.969
You out-qualified him in...

34:39.020 --> 34:41.969
~ You going to pretend you
don't know that as well?
~ Wait, this one's...

34:42.020 --> 34:43.530
12-7?

34:43.580 --> 34:47.409
~ 11-8!
~ 11-8.
~ But you really... you're
not keeping that in your head?

34:47.460 --> 34:51.530
I would be! I'd ring him up
every morning and go, "11-8!"

34:51.580 --> 34:52.810
He changed his number!

34:52.860 --> 34:54.290
Has he?

34:54.340 --> 34:57.410
I think one of the reasons we
were all surprised, I think,

34:57.460 --> 35:00.330
when you first started and
were immediately brilliant

35:00.380 --> 35:03.650
in the Red Bull, is that you just
don't look particularly ruthless.

35:03.700 --> 35:05.330
I mean, you're always smiling.

35:05.380 --> 35:08.010
The photographs we've been...
I've looked through to see

35:08.060 --> 35:10.370
if I could find one of
you not smiling, ever.

35:10.420 --> 35:14.010
Have a look at this, OK, because
this is winning in Canada.

35:14.060 --> 35:16.210
~ That's a huge beam, yes?
~ Yeah.

35:16.260 --> 35:19.770
And this is after you've been
disqualified in Australia.

35:19.820 --> 35:23.410
And then we've got another
photograph of you having some

35:23.460 --> 35:26.770
~ kind of blood test with
a horrible injection.
~ Oh, yeah!
~ Here we are.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.090
Still!

35:28.140 --> 35:31.010
You know what, it looks like a smile,
but that's pain right there.

35:31.060 --> 35:34.290
~ Is it?
~ That's... Yeah!
~ So you smile when you're in agony?

35:34.340 --> 35:38.050
Maybe if we see the lap later,
there might be some, er, er...

35:38.100 --> 35:41.250
some different emotions, cos it was
an open-face helmet in the Suzuki...

35:41.300 --> 35:44.290
We'll see if we can catch a moment
when you're not smiling.

35:44.340 --> 35:47.730
~ Yeah.
~ But that is later on. Now,
obviously, testing is happening.

35:47.780 --> 35:49.570
~ Now, in fact...
~ Yeah.
~ .. as we speak.

35:49.620 --> 35:51.810
~ Yeah.
~ In fact, how come you're not there?

35:51.860 --> 35:54.770
~ Top Gear's way more important.
~ Really?
~ Yeah.
~ Oh, we're honoured!

35:54.820 --> 35:57.370
~ I hate testing. I can't stand it.
~ Really?

35:57.420 --> 36:00.090
~ Uh, no, I wouldn't say I hate it, but...
~ Oh, no, you see.

36:00.140 --> 36:02.770
The PR machine's come
off the rails now!

36:02.820 --> 36:05.890
How's it going? Cos we've got some
Formula One fans here, inevitably,

36:05.940 --> 36:07.690
and they'll want to
know. How's it going?

36:07.740 --> 36:11.050
~ Are you going to be as fast as the Mercs?
~ Um, it's still very early.

36:11.100 --> 36:13.810
I mean, we are still finding our way.

36:13.860 --> 36:16.930
But, er, we've still got eight
more days in Barcelona after this.

36:16.980 --> 36:20.130
~ So, come Melbourne, we'll be right.
~ Is anybody else... It's only fair.

36:20.180 --> 36:23.130
There's a lot of Formula One fans.
Anyone got any questions they'd like

36:23.180 --> 36:25.930
to ask Daniel while he's here and
we're talking about Formula One?

36:25.980 --> 36:28.980
What does the back of
Lewis's car look like?

36:29.380 --> 36:32.300
Can you see that?

36:38.860 --> 36:40.490
Anyone else got another question?

36:40.540 --> 36:42.410
Who's better, you or Webber?

36:42.460 --> 36:44.460
Oh...

36:45.820 --> 36:48.050
I don't know.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.490
Actually, let's... We'll find out.

36:50.540 --> 36:54.010
~ I believe he's... 1.43.1, so..
~ He is on the board. Cos this is

36:54.060 --> 36:57.450
the only time ever when Formula
One drivers get to actually drive

36:57.500 --> 37:00.370
~ the same machine.
~ Same equipment, different
day, one could argue.

37:00.420 --> 37:02.650
~ The pressure is on, if I'm honest...
~ I know.

37:02.700 --> 37:04.890
~ .. today, particularly...
~ My heart rate's going up.

37:04.940 --> 37:07.690
Yeah, well, I mean, so's mine,
because I actually said,

37:07.740 --> 37:10.210
early last year, I actually
sent a tweet out

37:10.260 --> 37:13.370
saying I thought you were the
best driver on the F1 grid.

37:13.420 --> 37:15.160
Knuckles. Thanks.

37:18.580 --> 37:20.770
It's my way of saying thank you.

37:20.820 --> 37:24.010
Oh, I see, it's thank you.
I thought you'd hit me. Um...

37:24.060 --> 37:26.890
And people who know what they're
talking about as well said it.

37:26.940 --> 37:31.370
Alonso said... What did he call you?
He said you were "unbelievable".

37:31.420 --> 37:34.730
You know, so we have had this
sort of, "How good is Daniel?"

37:34.780 --> 37:36.370
And this is your opportunity to come

37:36.420 --> 37:39.330
and actually show everybody, in
the same car they've all driven.

37:39.380 --> 37:41.650
And the weather today was...

37:41.700 --> 37:45.170
~ It was good.
~ Yeah!
~ Like, that's a thing - I don't have excuses!

37:45.220 --> 37:47.210
No, it was cold and bright

37:47.260 --> 37:49.730
and about as perfect as
it could be for a car.

37:49.780 --> 37:52.610
So who would like to see
what is, let's be honest,

37:52.660 --> 37:54.330
an extremely important lap?

37:54.380 --> 37:55.930
Yes!

37:55.980 --> 37:57.610
Play the tape, let's have a look.

37:57.660 --> 37:59.450
Come on, let's do this!

37:59.500 --> 38:03.010
Obviously, you're back in the
old car, the Suzuki Liana.

38:03.060 --> 38:04.650
Nice to see it back.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.410
Race face on! Grr!

38:06.460 --> 38:09.690
That is! It's like a honey badger!

38:09.740 --> 38:12.930
I'm guessing, will you go...? No,
weirdly, you're not on the wide line

38:12.980 --> 38:15.930
~ taken by most of the Formula One drivers.
~ Taking it tight.

38:15.980 --> 38:17.650
~ Taking it tight.
~ You are.

38:17.700 --> 38:19.530
Just saving distance.

38:19.580 --> 38:20.890
Not there, you're not.

38:20.940 --> 38:23.210
Chicks'll go crazy for this!

38:25.260 --> 38:27.770
~ OK, this is it.
~ Bit of understeer.

38:27.820 --> 38:30.850
~ Little bit, but managed nicely.
~ Kept it tight!

38:30.900 --> 38:33.850
Come on! Let's go!

38:33.900 --> 38:37.010
~ Whoa! All sorts of hand gestures.
~ Getting racy!

38:37.060 --> 38:39.850
~ Hammerhead.
~ Keeping it in the lines, ooh...

38:39.900 --> 38:43.250
~ Oh!
~ Yeah, now get it all lined
up ready for a smooth, quick...

38:43.300 --> 38:47.250
Why am I telling you what you're
doing? You know what you're doing!

38:47.300 --> 38:49.090
Come on!

38:49.140 --> 38:51.330
Grr.

38:51.380 --> 38:54.170
Are you suggesting this
isn't fast enough?

38:54.220 --> 38:56.930
~ Look at it! Using the red and whites.
~ This line's good.

38:56.980 --> 38:58.930
This is... this is racy.

38:58.980 --> 39:02.570
~ Oh, that's keeping it comfy!
~ Yeah.
~ Keeping it comfy.

39:02.620 --> 39:05.570
~ Ooh, look at that, lift-off oversteer!
~ Yeah!

39:05.620 --> 39:09.170
Something our other guests should
use. Lift-off oversteering there.

39:09.220 --> 39:13.020
~ Ooh, that was...
~ Then just fling it in and
there we are across the line!

39:20.060 --> 39:22.660
Ah! Ha-ha, ha-ha!

39:24.260 --> 39:27.650
~ I'm actually nervous.
~ Go on, then, where do you think you've come?

39:27.700 --> 39:32.650
These are effectively drive times,
Jenson, 144. 144, 144, 144, so

39:32.700 --> 39:37.930
we're up to Lewis, then came along,
on his second attempt, and did...

39:37.980 --> 39:40.970
let's be honest, a fairly
unbeatable 142.9.

39:41.020 --> 39:43.090
~ Whoa.
~ Cos that's... What is he? Quicker...

39:43.140 --> 39:46.290
~ Mark's second, so he's 0.2 seconds off.
~ The anticipation's killing me.

39:46.340 --> 39:49.210
And then, we're right
down to Seb at 144.

39:50.060 --> 39:52.370
Should I just go lower or...?

39:52.420 --> 39:56.130
I don't know, I... The gap between
Webber and Vettel scares me.

39:56.180 --> 39:57.850
Like that's a big gap,
so I'm wondering

39:57.900 --> 40:00.490
~ if they had good track conditions.
~ That's 0.9 of a second.

40:00.540 --> 40:03.690
~ Did I have that?
~ A load of space to get
you and your smile in there.

40:05.380 --> 40:06.530
Just do it slowly!

40:06.580 --> 40:08.450
Lewis, 142.9...

40:08.500 --> 40:11.090
Do it slow, like one
number by one number.

40:11.140 --> 40:14.450
OK, I don't want... If I
lost, I want to lose slowly.

40:18.820 --> 40:20.810
Start with a one at least.

40:20.860 --> 40:23.410
~ One...
~ Come on!

40:23.460 --> 40:24.850
..50...

40:24.900 --> 40:26.370
Oh, no, come on.

40:26.420 --> 40:28.620
I'm just teasing you.

40:35.260 --> 40:38.850
Sorry, I'm letting you down
gently, is what I'm doing.

40:38.900 --> 40:42.050
~ One...
~ Ugh, do it slow, do it slow.

40:42.100 --> 40:44.740
~ .. forty...
~ Ugh... Please say two.

40:46.540 --> 40:48.730
~ Come on.
~ .. two.
~ Yeah!

40:48.780 --> 40:50.180
Ooh!

40:52.780 --> 40:56.010
My hair's standing on end,
cos it's another two.

40:56.060 --> 40:59.210
I mean, seriously, a 142.2.

41:02.820 --> 41:05.570
Staggering, absolutely staggering.

41:05.620 --> 41:08.380
How'd you do that?
How did you do that?

41:17.500 --> 41:21.090
That's the fastest anybody's
ever gone round our track.

41:21.140 --> 41:22.690
I feel better.

41:22.740 --> 41:25.340
In any of our reasonably priced cars.

41:27.820 --> 41:29.650
It'll be fun next year

41:29.700 --> 41:32.610
when you get back on the
circuit with that time.

41:32.660 --> 41:34.690
That is genuinely remarkable.

41:34.740 --> 41:38.370
I'm staggered because I...
Lewis has hung himself.

41:38.420 --> 41:42.250
Oh, and by the way, matey
boy, you want to...?

41:45.500 --> 41:47.850
In the same car, it turns out that

41:47.900 --> 41:51.610
the Aussie has just beaten the Brit,
it's the Ashes all over again.

41:51.660 --> 41:54.730
This is how I felt after Canada.
I didn't know what to say.

41:54.780 --> 41:57.690
So we've actually made a man happier
than winning a grand prix.

41:57.740 --> 42:01.580
Ladies and gentlemen, he's
done it! Daniel Ricciardo!

42:03.700 --> 42:06.780
Just... I'm really, that's...
I never thought...

42:08.740 --> 42:11.330
You know that wasn't
a fluke, don't you?

42:11.380 --> 42:15.210
You know he did three laps exactly
the same time? Three times.

42:15.260 --> 42:18.170
~ That's why he's... you know.
~ Yeah, yeah.

42:18.220 --> 42:22.250
Now, tonight, we have made three
ambulances, and to be honest,

42:22.300 --> 42:25.650
there have been a few niggles
and minor teething troubles.

42:25.700 --> 42:27.850
Yeah. For example, not one of them

42:27.900 --> 42:31.010
has yet delivered a patient
to a hospital alive.

42:31.060 --> 42:32.890
No. Nevertheless,

42:32.940 --> 42:34.650
the producer said we had to go off

42:34.700 --> 42:38.290
and build a Thunderbirds-style
International Rescue facility

42:38.340 --> 42:42.290
where we would be on hand with
our ambulances 24 hours a day,

42:42.340 --> 42:45.340
ready to respond at
a moment's notice.

42:48.020 --> 42:49.730
This is it.

42:49.780 --> 42:51.570
And inside the command module,

42:51.620 --> 42:54.050
we were waiting for
our first emergency.

42:54.100 --> 42:56.730
Have you heard about this

42:56.780 --> 43:00.410
Jewish volunteer ambulance
service called Hatzolah?

43:00.460 --> 43:02.050
No.

43:02.100 --> 43:05.850
No, honestly, I'm not joking, it's
unbelievable. The NHS response time

43:05.900 --> 43:10.250
in Britain for a life-threatening
situation is eight minutes.

43:10.300 --> 43:13.850
They get there in New York
- in New York, which is busy -

43:13.900 --> 43:15.290
in four minutes.

43:15.340 --> 43:17.170
~ That's from the call?
~ That's from the call.

43:17.220 --> 43:18.930
Four minutes later, they're there.

43:18.980 --> 43:22.090
There's 1,000 of them in New York,
OK, and they're normal people,

43:22.140 --> 43:24.610
they're builders, teachers,
whatever - they're trained.

43:24.660 --> 43:27.290
And they keep with them in
their cars, at all times,

43:27.340 --> 43:30.610
defibrillators, medicine
- all the things you need.

43:30.660 --> 43:33.770
It's a brilliant idea. And
we should be aiming for

43:33.820 --> 43:35.370
these response times.

43:35.420 --> 43:38.890
~ It takes me two minutes
to shut the back door!
~ He has a point.

43:40.660 --> 43:43.010
Oh, gentlemen, incoming message.

43:43.060 --> 43:45.380
What a remarkable printer.

43:46.820 --> 43:49.850
"A meteorite has landed
on the town of Theale.

43:49.900 --> 43:51.210
"There are many casualties.

43:51.260 --> 43:53.650
"Points will be awarded
for whichever one of you

43:53.700 --> 43:57.850
"gets one of those casualties to
the hospital in the quickest time."

43:57.900 --> 44:02.650
This is it. International Rescue has
been summoned, Thunderbirds are go!

44:46.060 --> 44:48.660
I'm power-sliding in an ambulance!

45:04.580 --> 45:06.250
Coming through.

45:07.660 --> 45:09.050
Yeah!

45:09.100 --> 45:11.460
Dig down, Cosworth power.

45:13.500 --> 45:16.410
'Naturally, we soon
encountered heavy traffic,

45:16.460 --> 45:18.650
'but we were ready for that.'

45:18.700 --> 45:20.370
Engaging siren.

45:21.820 --> 45:24.730
♪ Aah, aah, aah, aah Stayin'
alive, stayin' alive... ♪

45:24.780 --> 45:26.420
Come on, go!

45:27.740 --> 45:29.930
Can you not see I'm an ambulance?

45:29.980 --> 45:32.410
♪.. Ali-i-ive... ♪

45:32.460 --> 45:36.250
Yeah, Stayin' Alive, it's
reassuring for the patient...

45:36.300 --> 45:39.860
but it doesn't really say
"siren" to other road users.

45:41.220 --> 45:45.610
Get out of the way, you
normal ambulance! Come on!

45:45.660 --> 45:48.570
'My siren, like my ambulance,

45:48.620 --> 45:51.850
'was designed to scare
people out of the way.'

45:55.860 --> 45:58.860
'Annoyingly, though,
it didn't really work.'

46:08.860 --> 46:11.130
He's not scared at all.

46:11.180 --> 46:14.770
'If Hammond's siren wasn't working,
James's didn't have a prayer.'

46:14.820 --> 46:17.770
I know it's slightly annoying,

46:17.820 --> 46:20.330
but could you be an
awfully good sport

46:20.380 --> 46:23.940
and move out of the way of
the ambulance? Thank you.

46:25.820 --> 46:29.530
'When we arrived in Theale,
we split up to look

46:29.580 --> 46:31.730

Oh, God, the place is a mess!

46:34.180 --> 46:36.890

no, this isn't the site,

46:36.940 --> 46:39.280

Blood, oxygen, Nurofen.

47:11.980 --> 47:13.980
Yeah, temporarily lost.

47:14.620 --> 47:18.540

I mean, it can't be...

47:20.500 --> 47:25.090
I can't see anything that's
been damaged by a meteorite.

Still hot.

~ Jeremy...
~ What?
~ This is absolutely amazing.

48:11.660 --> 48:14.650
It is, none of the girls
are wearing underwear.

48:14.700 --> 48:17.820
~ Oh, here comes Hammond.
~ About time.

48:19.060 --> 48:22.290
Do you just have the fire brigade
following you around...

48:22.340 --> 48:24.770
~ as a matter of course?
~ Oh, yeah, it does do that.

48:24.820 --> 48:27.890
I didn't think it was going
to be a real meteorite strike.

48:27.940 --> 48:31.090
~ I mean, that's...
~ No, it is.
~ .. actually happened.

48:31.140 --> 48:32.650

"This lets you know how long you have

"before they must reach
the hospital. However..."

"However, each time they
are jolted or bashed,

48:48.340 --> 48:51.210
"the timer will jump
forwards ten seconds."

48:51.260 --> 48:54.010
~ How long's on the timers?
~ Well, I don't know.

48:54.060 --> 48:56.690
I presume depending on
how wounded they are.

48:56.740 --> 48:58.210
Oh, so it'll be different.

48:58.260 --> 49:01.530

the longest amount of time.

49:06.820 --> 49:09.220
Right. I'm just going to get in.

~ Absolutely, and over here
we have the scoreboard.

Now, Jeremy, you won that.

56:54.220 --> 56:59.330
~ I did.
~ So you get 10 points. Uh,
I came second, I get 5.

56:59.380 --> 57:02.770
Richard Hammond, you were last,
and for that you get nought.

57:02.820 --> 57:05.570
Yep, OK, fair enough. Then
we move on to lap times.

57:05.620 --> 57:08.570

for every second your ambulance

57:08.620 --> 57:11.850
got round the track driven by
the Stig in under three minutes.

57:11.900 --> 57:15.010

57:15.060 --> 57:19.770
~ Jeremy, you did it in...
~ 2.24.
~ So you get, uh, it's 36.

57:19.820 --> 57:23.410
~ 36 points.
~ Yeah. And now, James, um...

57:25.340 --> 57:29.650
Yours works out, I'm afraid,
at minus 568 there.

~ No, I'm afraid your tailgate

57:32.540 --> 57:35.410

All right, never mind. Let's
move on - medical procedures.

57:38.180 --> 57:40.530
Now, uh, I performed two of those,

57:40.580 --> 57:44.010
you get 7 points for each
one, so I got 14 points.

57:44.060 --> 57:47.050
Richard Hammond, you actually
performed three,

57:47.100 --> 57:49.010

57:49.060 --> 57:50.690
Uh, no, hang on a minute.

57:50.740 --> 57:53.730
I did four, because I did the
intestines, the catheter,

57:53.780 --> 57:55.290
the drip and I did the airway.

57:55.340 --> 57:57.210
Yeah, but you weren't
asked to do the airway.

57:57.260 --> 57:59.650
~ Yes, but I did it.
~ You could've done a breast enlargement,

57:59.700 --> 58:01.890

difference to your points.

slightly cheaper, so you get 5.

say "ambulance"

59:55.260 --> 59:58.810
No, well, your door didn't work
one time, and you fired a man

59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.410
through a window the second
time, so that's definitely no.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.250
Yeah, that did happen.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:07.210
James, you didn't actually
have a patient to deliver.

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:10.370
~ No, you didn't.
~ So I'm afraid you get minus 10 for that.

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:13.570
Oh, no. All gone wrong.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:16.170
Yeah, Jeremy, yours did work.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.970
It did, so you get 5 points. Right.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:22.370
So hang on a minute, hang on, hang
on, hang on... this is close.

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:25.730
Not with you, obviously,
James, but Hammond and I,

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:29.170
I'm only now... I'm only
three points behind you.

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.890
And we arrive at this bit.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:34.290
OK, this is the condition of
the patient when he arrived...

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.570
Well, I say "he", the
"she", whatever it was.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.490
~ .. arrived at the hospital.
~ Yeah.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.930
So, ahem, here we go. James May...

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:43.570
~ Yes.
~ Your patient condition was...

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.970
Missing.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.650
Yes. Presumed dead.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.010
~ Yeah, dead.
~ So you score...

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.850
~ Uh, nought.
~ Right, nought.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:54.810
~ The condition of Hammond's patient?
~ Dead.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.850
~ Right, so he scores...
~ Nought.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.410
Ahem, and the condition
of my patient?

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.860
Your patient, Jeremy, was alive.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.060
~ And so I score...?
~ One.

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:13.610
~ What do you mean, one?
~ It's nought for dead, one for alive.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.490
I was the only one of the three of us

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.570
who got a patient to a hospital
alive, and that matters!

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.930
Yes, and that's why
you got that point.

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:24.330
So you're saying that because
I only get one point,

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.690
I'm... That means I now lose to you,

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:31.730
even though your van
was slow, expensive,

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:34.770
its brakes caught fire
every time you tried to

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.570
slow down, and it killed everybody
who got into the back of it.

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.210
Yep.

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:42.170
And the only reason you won
is because you happened to be

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:44.610
good at putting a tube
in a ladyboy's sausage.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.530
~ Yep.
~ Which means that you, Richard Hammond,

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:51.370
have single handedly ruined
the National Health Service.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.890
Yep.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:55.130
And on that bombshell,
it's time to end.

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.050
Thank you so much for watching.
See you again next week.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.660
Good night.
