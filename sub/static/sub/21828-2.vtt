WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.792
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4...

00:04.875 --> 00:06.917
(Harris) One of the trucks
isn't following the others.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.417
Someone does want to make monsters.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.834
This is just the beginning.

00:13.125 --> 00:15.709
Your parents went into hiding.
They had me put you up for adoption,

00:15.792 --> 00:17.250
they wanted you
to have a normal life.

00:17.333 --> 00:18.375
Stay safe, okay?

00:18.458 --> 00:20.875
Sub Mode, engage!

00:20.959 --> 00:22.709
(Godfrey) Seth Harper, who we now know

00:22.792 --> 00:26.583
was behind the monster attacks,
is now believed to have perished

00:26.667 --> 00:28.917
in his battle with Mech-X4.

00:30.542 --> 00:33.792
(laughing)

00:33.875 --> 00:37.792
So, we're almost done building
our new hospital in Tanzania,

00:37.875 --> 00:40.083
and then, out of nowhere, sandstorm!

00:40.166 --> 00:42.959
-Dad, that sounds horrible.
-But you're okay, right?

00:43.041 --> 00:45.333
You know me. Just trying
to keep the sand out of my hair.

00:47.792 --> 00:50.166
-Joke will never get old.
-So, when's your next visit?

00:50.250 --> 00:52.667
Well, we have one more hospital
to build in Egypt--

00:52.750 --> 00:54.208
(sneezes)

00:54.291 --> 00:59.000
The good thing about being adopted
is I didn't inherit your weirdo sneeze.

00:59.083 --> 01:00.041
It's not weird--

01:00.125 --> 01:01.291
(sneezes)

01:01.375 --> 01:03.291
-Weird.
-Weird.

01:04.166 --> 01:06.583
All right, it's 3:00 AM here.
I better hit it.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.291
I know you guys have school.

01:08.375 --> 01:09.542
I love you guys.

01:09.625 --> 01:11.542
Say hi to your mom for me, all right?

01:11.625 --> 01:13.291
-All right, Dad, love you.
-Love you.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.000
Okay...

01:17.083 --> 01:18.458
Hey.

01:18.542 --> 01:19.750
How's Davis?

01:19.834 --> 01:22.083
He's good. He's still making
the same bald jokes, so.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.208
Oh, okay.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.333
-Are you excited for ClamJam?
-Yeah, I am!

01:25.417 --> 01:27.875
It's strange, though.
I keep getting these surprise e-mails,

01:27.959 --> 01:30.625
saying I got accepted to food festivals
I didn't even apply for.

01:30.709 --> 01:32.208
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:32.291 --> 01:34.834
You know, it's like I'm barely
in Bay City anymore.

01:34.917 --> 01:38.250
-It's kind of the point with Grey back.
-Okay, you guys. Love you.

01:38.333 --> 01:41.166
Please be good this weekend. Have fun.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.875
And, uh, curfew, homework, kisses.

01:43.959 --> 01:46.208
-(both) Not in that order.
-Exactly.

01:46.291 --> 01:48.208
Okay, you guys, love you.

01:48.291 --> 01:49.792
-Bye, Mom. Love you.
-Love you.

01:55.750 --> 01:57.000
(sighs)

01:57.083 --> 01:58.792
Hey, you all right?

01:58.875 --> 02:00.166
Yeah.

02:00.250 --> 02:03.166
I think it's really cool that you have
so much stuff in common with Dad.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.834
I mean, you do, too.
Your shared love for canned meat.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.834
-Oh, so good.
-Skating.

02:07.917 --> 02:10.625
Yeah, but that's stuff
he taught me, not stuff I inherited.

02:10.709 --> 02:13.792
It just makes me wonder
if I'm anything like my birth parents.

02:15.834 --> 02:17.875
(screams)

02:17.959 --> 02:19.333
-(growls)
-Ryan!

02:22.083 --> 02:23.125
Ryan!

02:24.875 --> 02:25.792
Ryan!

02:25.875 --> 02:27.875
(theme music playing)

03:03.333 --> 03:05.417
Walk me through exactly what happened.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.208
Okay, I had a vision,

03:07.291 --> 03:09.875
just like the first time Mech-X4 tried
to reach out to me,

03:09.959 --> 03:11.333
just way more intense.

03:12.041 --> 03:15.417
I saw Grey, I saw some
sort of shark monster.

03:15.500 --> 03:19.166
I also saw Harper's giant monster
heart somewhere underwater.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.375
But we destroyed it.

03:20.458 --> 03:22.709
It's possible pieces of the heart
landed out in the bay.

03:22.792 --> 03:25.500
Hang on. We don't even know
if the visions are real

03:25.583 --> 03:27.125
or where they came from.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.291
But the last time I got a vision,

03:29.375 --> 03:30.792
it led us straight to the robot.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.959
Guys, we're getting a new robot.

03:33.041 --> 03:35.000
-I call technopath!
-No.

03:35.834 --> 03:38.750
Okay, so, if the visions are real,

03:38.834 --> 03:41.041
that means that Grey
is making another monster.

03:41.125 --> 03:43.291
But she only did that for Harper,
and he's dead.

03:43.375 --> 03:46.166
I don't know what she's up to,
we'll ask her after we take her down.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.792
(scoffs) We are no equipped
to fight underwater.

03:48.875 --> 03:51.917
Then we'll have to upgrade Sub Mode
with everything we need to fight Grey.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.417
Texting Leo.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.041
But wait. How are we gonna find
the monster heart?

03:56.125 --> 03:57.959
We don't even know
where in the bay it landed.

03:58.041 --> 04:01.125
Harper was working
with some unique metals.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.583
I could track it if I knew
exactly what it was made of.

04:03.667 --> 04:04.959
And how do we find that out?

04:05.041 --> 04:06.709
It would be in the designs for the heart,

04:06.792 --> 04:08.750
and those are somewhere
at Harper Futuristics.

04:08.834 --> 04:11.125
We'll go there. Harris,
you help Leo with the Sub Mode.

04:11.208 --> 04:13.500
Okay, but for the record, um,
if we get a new robot,

04:13.583 --> 04:15.333
-I get to drive.
-No.

04:17.208 --> 04:18.458
Aw.

04:28.917 --> 04:30.000
Leo?

04:30.083 --> 04:31.542
-Hey!
-Aah!

04:31.625 --> 04:33.834
Welcome to the ferry hangar.

04:33.917 --> 04:35.709
Why do you always do that?

04:35.792 --> 04:36.959
It's a curse.

04:37.041 --> 04:39.083
I think it's why I'm not allowed
around old people.

04:39.166 --> 04:41.834
-Yeah, okay.
-How's the underwater upgrade going?

04:41.917 --> 04:45.583
I always figured the robot
would have to fight underwater.

04:45.667 --> 04:47.417
And here are the blueprints.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.917
Flight Mode. Tank Mode.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.250
-Disco Mode.
-Oh, they actually have that.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.834
The little mirror ball coming down?

04:53.917 --> 04:55.500
Yeah, that's all. It's just, uh...

04:55.583 --> 04:56.917
Aha! Sub Mode.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.542
Take a look.

04:59.834 --> 05:03.417
This will give Mech-X4
underwater propulsion,

05:03.500 --> 05:05.834
weapons, navigation, everything you need

05:05.917 --> 05:08.083
-for an aquatic smackdown.
-Haha.

05:08.166 --> 05:09.583
Huh? Yeah?

05:09.667 --> 05:10.542
(both) Science!

05:10.625 --> 05:12.208
Yeah, yeah.

05:12.291 --> 05:14.291
I built most of it a long time ago.

05:14.375 --> 05:16.667
I just need the couple things
I texted you to bring,

05:16.750 --> 05:18.792
and then Sub Mode 2.0 will be good to go!

05:20.625 --> 05:23.500
Uh... what was I supposed to bring?

05:23.583 --> 05:24.709
Sorry. Yeah.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.417
You know what? I think I have it on me.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.583
Yup, there it is. Bada-bing, bada-boom.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.917
Leo, there's like
a million things on here!

05:32.000 --> 05:33.750
Where am I supposed to find all of this?

05:33.834 --> 05:36.417
Actually, you know what?
Most of that is groceries,

05:36.500 --> 05:39.125
so, we'll actually only need... that.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.291
So, we'll need that-- and eggs!

05:41.375 --> 05:43.291
Should probably get eggs,
eggs are important.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.208
I miss the smaller Mech-Links.

06:11.291 --> 06:13.542
Do you miss that they were packed
with Harper technology

06:13.625 --> 06:16.000
and that he was probably
monitoring everything we did?

06:16.083 --> 06:19.166
Yeah. But I could stream
my Peruvian soap operas.

06:19.250 --> 06:20.792
Keep your voices down!

06:21.625 --> 06:23.333
Now, where do we find those designs?

06:23.417 --> 06:25.792
(Mark) I guess we just start
at the secret level.

06:25.875 --> 06:28.125
That's where Harper built
his giant monster heart.

06:28.208 --> 06:29.834
I saw it when I rescued Mom.

06:29.917 --> 06:31.417
Wasn't Harris with you?

06:31.500 --> 06:34.333
Not when I tell it. It's this way.

06:35.542 --> 06:37.792
(Mark) There should be
a hidden elevator here somewhere.

06:38.709 --> 06:39.959
I got this.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.333
(panting)

07:02.667 --> 07:03.917
What is this place?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.959
This is where they store submarines

07:06.041 --> 07:07.417
after they've been decommissioned.

07:07.500 --> 07:10.375
(chuckles)
Definitely gonna need one of these!

07:10.458 --> 07:12.458
Yeah, and we'll need one of those,

07:12.542 --> 07:14.834
and that thing over there,
we're gonna need that as well.

07:14.917 --> 07:16.542
You'd be surprised what people throw away.

07:16.625 --> 07:19.250
You know, just last week,
I found a blender in an alley?

07:19.333 --> 07:21.834
-You know what I could make with that?
-A new weapon!

07:21.917 --> 07:23.792
No. Juice!

07:25.208 --> 07:26.417
-Juice.
-Hmm.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.709
So, this is how you built
all your giant robots?

07:28.792 --> 07:30.625
-Out of scrap?
-Exactly.

07:30.709 --> 07:33.000
Everything in Mech-X4 was "borrowed."

07:33.083 --> 07:34.875
Uh, you mean stolen?

07:34.959 --> 07:38.333
Yeah. That's why I put these quotation
marks around the word "borrowed."

07:38.417 --> 07:40.291
Yeah. Aha!

07:40.375 --> 07:42.417
Now this is the baby
we really want, right here.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.125
It has the first prototype
of a stealth engine.

07:45.208 --> 07:47.792
It will make our Sub Mode silent,
but deadly.

07:47.875 --> 07:50.166
Ooh, do not say that around Spyder.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.125
I promise, I promise.

07:52.208 --> 07:55.250
I can't believe they just tear all
this stuff up and turn it into scrap.

07:55.333 --> 07:58.333
Let's get what we need and get back
to the hangar before someone sees us.

07:58.417 --> 08:00.000
-Hey!
-(both scream)

08:00.083 --> 08:03.000
You know, that is really rude,
just surprising someone like that.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.709
-You believe this guy?
-Really?

08:04.792 --> 08:05.625
What?

08:05.709 --> 08:07.458
What are you two doing here? Hm?

08:07.542 --> 08:10.125
This is a military facility.
It's off-limits.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.333
-Um...
-We're taking selfies.

08:13.417 --> 08:15.959
-Yeah, selfie time!
-Hey, yeah!

08:16.041 --> 08:18.083
It's a fun way to engage
in social media. Come on!

08:20.542 --> 08:21.667
-Hey!
-Yeah!

08:21.750 --> 08:24.041
Come on, join in. It's fun.
Get in the next one. Selfie.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.834
Bartholomew! Logan!

08:28.083 --> 08:30.959
Yeah, well... Jeremiah! Elwood!

08:31.041 --> 08:32.583
We don't have backup.

08:32.667 --> 08:33.583
Oh.

08:34.291 --> 08:36.166
Um, I do not know this man.

08:53.625 --> 08:54.583
Whoa.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.458
That's a lot of computers.

08:56.542 --> 08:59.417
This must be Harper's hidden data vault.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.750
That's probably where he hid
all his secret files.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.750
(electricity crackling)

09:05.834 --> 09:07.083
Careful!

09:07.166 --> 09:09.166
That power source is throwing off
a lot of energy.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.834
(Ryan) Don't worry, I can control it.

09:16.917 --> 09:19.917
Here it is! All right,
I'm gonna download it to my phone.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.041
And...

09:22.125 --> 09:23.291
done.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.542
All right, let's get out of here.
Shut everything down.

09:25.625 --> 09:28.250
Wait, there's a bunch of data cores here.

09:28.333 --> 09:31.625
Monster designs, hidden bank accounts...

09:31.709 --> 09:35.125
Wait. Technopath test subjects?

09:35.208 --> 09:37.500
You mean, like your birth parents?

09:37.583 --> 09:39.959
It's got to be.
Harper was hunting them down.

09:40.792 --> 09:43.792
Okay, well, what does it say?
Who are they? Where are they?

09:43.875 --> 09:45.041
Let's find out.

09:48.125 --> 09:50.333
It's protected against my powers.
I can't get through.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.750
(Mark) Then we'll have to take
the data core to the robot.

09:52.834 --> 09:53.750
(door opens)

09:55.750 --> 09:57.250
Guys, we're not alone.

09:59.542 --> 10:01.208
You!

10:01.291 --> 10:03.542
You're the one who destroyed Harper.

10:03.625 --> 10:05.417
You ruined everything!

10:05.500 --> 10:07.041
Well, now you're gonna pay.

10:13.667 --> 10:16.458
Morris, what are you doing here?

10:16.542 --> 10:17.750
We're on the run.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.583
The cops never found this level.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.000
But you did.

10:23.166 --> 10:25.792
And that means
that we can't let you leave.

10:30.375 --> 10:31.250
Okay, we got to go!

10:31.333 --> 10:33.667
No, there's information
about your birth parents.

10:33.750 --> 10:34.583
Can you get it out?

10:34.667 --> 10:36.834
Rip something expensive out
of something more expensive?

10:36.917 --> 10:39.750
-One of my special skills.
-I'll open it up for you. It's in Core 12.

10:46.291 --> 10:48.750
(grunting)

10:58.500 --> 10:59.834
My arm! My arm!

11:15.125 --> 11:16.250
Huh?

11:16.333 --> 11:17.375
(laughs)

11:23.875 --> 11:26.333
Okay, I may or may not be stuck!

11:26.417 --> 11:29.041
(electricity crackling)

11:30.125 --> 11:31.542
Whoa!

11:35.125 --> 11:36.625
(Morris) The fan's speeding up!

11:43.333 --> 11:45.500
(grunts)

11:48.000 --> 11:49.917
-Say good night, kid!
-No!

11:53.041 --> 11:55.959
(groaning)

11:56.041 --> 11:57.542
I got it!

12:02.709 --> 12:05.875
(Ryan) The core!
It's getting sucked into the fan!

12:12.709 --> 12:13.583
No!

12:13.667 --> 12:15.458
Whoa!

12:33.583 --> 12:34.709
(sighs)

12:39.875 --> 12:41.667
Oh...

12:41.750 --> 12:43.625
-(punch smacks)
-(man grunts)

12:43.709 --> 12:46.375
-Hey, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.291
-How's the data core?
-It's busted, but...

12:48.375 --> 12:49.959
you could have been killed, dingus.

12:50.041 --> 12:53.750
-Dingus is my word.
-It's not worth risking your life over.

12:53.834 --> 12:56.959
It was important to you,
so yeah, it was worth it.

12:57.041 --> 12:58.625
Dingus.

12:58.709 --> 13:00.291
What about these guys?

13:00.375 --> 13:01.959
I just texted the police. Let's go.

13:03.166 --> 13:05.208
Wait, wait, wait!

13:05.291 --> 13:08.500
Oh, man, these are cool.
I can see how much butt we kicked!

13:20.250 --> 13:21.500
What is this thing?

13:21.583 --> 13:23.041
-A bionic ball.
-Donut.

13:23.959 --> 13:25.667
(both) A bionic...

13:25.750 --> 13:28.417
donut... ball?

13:28.500 --> 13:30.792
You two better start telling me the truth,

13:30.875 --> 13:32.333
or I'm calling the police.

13:32.417 --> 13:36.500
Go ahead. I was just about to do
the same thing myself.

13:36.583 --> 13:40.125
We're from the National Submarine
Administration. Ever heard of us?

13:40.208 --> 13:43.500
And this whole setup is completely
unacceptable. Isn't that right...

13:44.625 --> 13:45.583
Bradley?

13:46.500 --> 13:49.792
Exactly, Leo... na.

13:50.333 --> 13:52.500
Nice. Nice improv. Really strong.

13:52.583 --> 13:55.000
You've got a positively ionized rotor

13:55.083 --> 13:57.834
sitting right next to a negatively ionized
metal apparatus thing.

13:57.917 --> 13:59.417
(Harris) That sonar drone
you're holding,

13:59.500 --> 14:02.959
picked up a major leak of free radicals
coming from the power core.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.041
-This whole thing could go omega.
-Omega.

14:05.125 --> 14:07.375
-(mimics explosion)
-Stop it! Stop it, stop it!

14:09.291 --> 14:13.208
National Submarine Administration--
There is no such thing.

14:13.291 --> 14:14.709
And one of you is a child!

14:14.792 --> 14:17.041
-Yeah. I guess it's Plan B, then.
-Mm-hmm.

14:17.125 --> 14:18.333
Drone!

14:20.000 --> 14:22.542
(mechanical whirring)

14:22.625 --> 14:23.875
Huh?

14:27.542 --> 14:28.834
(guard shrieks)

14:28.917 --> 14:29.959
Run!

14:33.709 --> 14:34.792
(sighs)

14:34.875 --> 14:37.291
What are you doing?
Now you're adding assault to theft.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.917
Don't forget the treason.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.333
(chuckles)

14:40.375 --> 14:41.959
Relax. It's for the greater good.

14:42.041 --> 14:44.125
-The greater good?
-(guard screaming)

14:44.208 --> 14:46.834
-Let's steal stuff.
-Surprisingly easy to convince you.

14:46.917 --> 14:48.792
Let's steal some stuff!

14:52.583 --> 14:55.583
Harris says he's on his way to the ferry
to finish the Sub Mode upgrade--

14:55.667 --> 14:57.500
(screams)

14:57.583 --> 14:59.625
I'm getting another vision.

15:02.417 --> 15:04.333
The monster's in the bay.

15:15.458 --> 15:17.542
Harris, you ready?

15:17.625 --> 15:21.417
(Harris on intercom)
Yup! Just in the nick of time, son.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.125
Full steam ahead.

15:24.208 --> 15:27.166
(Harris)
Closing in on your position... now.

15:28.542 --> 15:30.417
All right! Let's do this.

15:31.959 --> 15:35.458
He's always saying, "Let's do this."
Have you noticed that?

15:35.542 --> 15:37.041
-Yeah, it pumps up the team.
-Mm-hmm.

15:37.125 --> 15:40.166
Plus, Spyder has the attention span
of a squirrel, so

15:40.250 --> 15:42.250
you got to let him know
when it's time to "do this,"

15:42.333 --> 15:45.125
- otherwise...
-Guys, we can hear you.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.458
Oh, um...

15:47.542 --> 15:49.125
Let's do this!

16:05.417 --> 16:06.959
Leo, ready to dock with Sub Mode.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.083
Okay, easy... easy.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.083
-Oh!
-Ah, yes!

16:23.166 --> 16:24.917
-Yeah.
-Science.

16:28.375 --> 16:29.500
Submarine locked in.

16:29.583 --> 16:32.041
Mech-Execute!

16:40.333 --> 16:41.834
Torpedoes!

16:41.917 --> 16:44.750
-We got torpedoes.
-Spyder, wait until we get to the monster.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.667
Oh, but, Ryan, we have
more than one torpedo.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.750
Leo's monitoring the sub's systems.
Everything linked up?

16:52.834 --> 16:54.917
Everything's fully integrated
with Mech-X4.

16:55.792 --> 16:58.792
Bringing up our new sonar tracking system.

16:58.875 --> 17:01.000
I just need the designs
for the giant monster heart.

17:01.083 --> 17:03.208
Here you go.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.709
Hmm. The heart's made of steel
infused with ooze.

17:09.792 --> 17:12.041
-Harper was a beautiful man.
-What?

17:12.125 --> 17:13.834
-Excuse me?
-Seriously?

17:13.917 --> 17:14.792
Scanning.

17:15.917 --> 17:19.709
(pinging)

17:19.792 --> 17:22.041
We got a ping, y'all!

17:32.166 --> 17:35.208
(roaring)

17:35.291 --> 17:37.750
-It's dead ahead.
-I see it.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.291
What is that thing?

17:43.750 --> 17:46.625
It looks like an insect and a shark
had a gigantic baby.

17:46.709 --> 17:50.583
Insect-a-shark! Ah, trademark,
copyright, Spyder Incorporated.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.709
Let's light this fish-bug up!

17:52.792 --> 17:54.125
Insect-a-shark!

18:01.917 --> 18:03.917
(Ryan) It's dodging our torpedoes!

18:05.750 --> 18:07.208
Here it comes. Everyone hang on!

18:13.667 --> 18:14.792
(Mark) What's it doing?

18:15.834 --> 18:16.959
It's just staring at us.

18:17.709 --> 18:20.709
You know what? Maybe it's friendly.
I'm sorry I shot at you.

18:23.959 --> 18:25.458
(roaring)

18:33.917 --> 18:35.625
Not sorry! Not sorry at all!

18:40.583 --> 18:42.500
Where's the monster?

18:42.583 --> 18:43.959
(pinging)

18:44.041 --> 18:46.542
(scoffs) It's back to stealing the heart.

18:46.625 --> 18:50.375
It can dodge our torpedoes. It's faster
than anything we've ever gone up against.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.208
Then we'll have to get close to it.

18:52.291 --> 18:54.417
Leo, does this have
any type of stealth mode?

18:54.500 --> 18:56.750
The best. It's silent...

18:56.834 --> 18:57.792
but deadly.

19:01.083 --> 19:03.000
I told you! I told you!

19:03.709 --> 19:06.542
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting to say that.

19:06.625 --> 19:10.041
What about the monster's sonic blast?
It goes right through our shields.

19:10.125 --> 19:11.917
It needs to pause to charge up its attack.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.542
We have a few seconds
to take it down.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.458
Our best chance is to sneak up on it.

19:20.041 --> 19:21.667
All right, let's drill this beast.

19:34.208 --> 19:36.417
(Ryan) It's getting ready to attack!

19:43.917 --> 19:46.125
-Yes!
-Woo!

19:46.208 --> 19:47.083
Let's go!

19:50.417 --> 19:53.375
We're not finished yet. We still
have to deal with the heart. Spyder?

19:53.458 --> 19:56.125
Well, if you're gonna make me...

19:56.208 --> 19:58.500
Hey, look at that.
Turns out we are out of torpedoes.

19:58.583 --> 20:00.792
-Seriously?
-Psych!

20:06.041 --> 20:07.500
(distant explosion)

20:07.583 --> 20:09.875
All right, let's get back to dry land.

20:18.375 --> 20:19.792
Spyder!

20:21.041 --> 20:23.333
Why are you guys still working
on that busted drive?

20:23.417 --> 20:25.792
This thing has information
about your birth parents on it.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.291
Bam!

20:30.375 --> 20:32.917
Woo! Which is why we fixed it.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.917
You're welcome.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.375
The data's still encrypted,
but there's a way to crack it.

20:38.458 --> 20:41.458
I wonder what they're like,
and who they are.

20:41.542 --> 20:43.166
Well, I can tell you one thing, Ryan,

20:43.250 --> 20:45.125
if they're your birth parents...

20:46.875 --> 20:48.834
they're probably, like, short.

20:48.917 --> 20:50.500
What? (laughs)

20:50.583 --> 20:52.166
And probably bad at math.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.709
(laughs)

20:53.792 --> 20:56.000
-(Spyder) Scared of the dark.
-(Ryan) Very funny, guys.

20:56.083 --> 20:59.834
(Mark) You know, we can do this all day.
I got no shortage of little brother jokes.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.250
Guys, I've been thinking
about the visions.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.125
If it weren't for them, we would
have never known about the monster.

21:10.208 --> 21:12.208
Or what it was up to.

21:12.291 --> 21:15.375
Leo was the guy who programmed Mech-X4
to send me those messages

21:15.458 --> 21:18.291
the first time the robot linked up to me.

21:18.375 --> 21:21.250
Which means someone must have
created these messages,

21:21.333 --> 21:24.041
but if it wasn't Leo, who was it?

21:27.625 --> 21:30.208
(Ryan) I don't know,
but whoever it was was helping.

21:30.291 --> 21:31.709
Just think about it.

21:31.792 --> 21:34.542
Someone out there... is our ally.

21:35.458 --> 21:37.041
We have someone on our side.

21:37.917 --> 21:39.208
This better work.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.583
Stupid robot showed up.

21:42.667 --> 21:46.083
They might have blown up the heart,
but this component is all I need.

21:54.375 --> 21:56.542
Come on, Ryan.

21:56.625 --> 21:59.333
I guess I'll have to give you
my next message in person.

22:04.041 --> 22:06.041
(theme music playing)

22:28.834 --> 22:30.250
(barks)
