00:26.600 --> 00:29.933
Hey, check this out.

00:32.967 --> 00:36.067
Yeah, you could get a lot
of dough for that thing.

00:39.667 --> 00:41.366
Watch it.

00:44.501 --> 00:46.200
What is that?

00:46.201 --> 00:48.166
Someone's downstairs!

00:48.167 --> 00:49.900
Call the police.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.334
Where are you going?

00:54.700 --> 00:55.699
Hey! hey!

00:58.101 --> 00:59.333
Richard! no!

00:59.334 --> 01:00.899
Richard!

01:00.900 --> 01:01.999
Aah!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.666
Aah! aah!

01:09.020 --> 01:10.420
Richard!

01:10.421 --> 01:13.490
Richard! Aah!

01:16.894 --> 01:19.029
Group therapy folks,

01:19.030 --> 01:20.997
Report to the kitchen for kp duty.

01:20.998 --> 01:24.701
Everybody else, I'll see
you in the common room.

01:24.702 --> 01:25.869
Ava, come here.

01:25.870 --> 01:27.471
Girl, you're gonna
get me in trouble.

01:27.472 --> 01:29.372
Ok, what's up?

01:29.373 --> 01:31.641
Shut up 2 seconds
and I'll tell you.

01:31.642 --> 01:34.211
Keep this for me,
but you can't let anyone see it

01:34.212 --> 01:35.679
Or know you've got it. Promise?

01:35.680 --> 01:36.680
Where did you get that?

01:36.681 --> 01:38.748
Just promise.

01:38.749 --> 01:40.517
You know I don't do promises.

01:40.518 --> 01:43.487
Forget your stupid rules.
Just promise me.

01:43.488 --> 01:44.554
Or give it back.

01:44.555 --> 01:46.623
All right, I promise.

01:46.624 --> 01:48.625
Ava, marly,
you got somewhere to be?

01:48.626 --> 01:50.860
Oh, yeah, I had an eyelash.

01:51.329 --> 01:53.430
Yeah, it's still here.

01:53.431 --> 01:54.698
My wishes never come true.

01:54.699 --> 01:56.232
Let's go.

01:59.637 --> 02:02.572
All right, calm down.
Slow down. Slow down.

02:02.573 --> 02:04.007
Dad, are you actually praying?

02:04.008 --> 02:05.509
Of course not.

02:05.510 --> 02:07.010
That is so insulting.

02:07.011 --> 02:08.612
Look, you'll get your license

02:08.613 --> 02:10.213
When you're good and ready.

02:10.214 --> 02:11.781
But I've been 16 for months.

02:11.782 --> 02:12.916
Which is my point exactly.

02:14.552 --> 02:17.721
Ok, look, parallel park just here.

02:17.722 --> 02:20.157
All right. You get one shot.

02:20.158 --> 02:22.025
I am. All right, pull up.

02:22.026 --> 02:23.026
Pull up. Pull up.

02:23.027 --> 02:24.094
I am.

02:24.095 --> 02:25.228
All right, a little bit further,

02:25.229 --> 02:26.863
A little bit further,
a little bit further.

02:26.864 --> 02:27.864
All right, stop.

02:27.865 --> 02:29.432
Ok.

02:32.703 --> 02:34.671
No. No cheating.

02:34.672 --> 02:36.239
It's technology, dad.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.241
The future is now.

02:40.478 --> 02:43.480
Wait-what-where?! Puppy!

02:44.749 --> 02:46.616
Did I hit something?

02:46.617 --> 02:49.152
I believe so.

02:55.026 --> 02:57.961
I mean, it's not like I
enjoyed it or anything.

02:57.962 --> 02:59.796
And I am paying for all
the damage, aren't I?

03:02.600 --> 03:03.700
Don't hold a grudge.

03:03.701 --> 03:06.203
You hold a grudge,
your face gets pinched.

03:06.204 --> 03:08.271
Look at your mum.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.273
Yeah.

03:10.274 --> 03:11.474
I need you to listen to something.

03:11.475 --> 03:12.809
I need you to tell me what to do.

03:12.810 --> 03:13.810
All right, slow down.

03:13.811 --> 03:14.811
Just listen.

03:15.813 --> 03:17.080
Ria, you have to come get me.

03:17.081 --> 03:19.282
Something happened.
I'm not sure what,

03:19.283 --> 03:20.650
But something bad.

03:20.651 --> 03:22.285
I'm not even supposed
to be on the phone.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.386
Please, I need-

03:25.923 --> 03:28.091
Well, she sounds pretty desperate.

03:28.092 --> 03:30.427
Yeah, well, she's a
liar and a delinquent,

03:30.428 --> 03:32.329
Which is she's been
locked up for 7 months.

03:32.330 --> 03:34.097
What, you feel her
message is a lie?

03:34.098 --> 03:36.433
I don't know. I don't know.
I never know with her.

03:36.434 --> 03:39.469
Right. Who is this girl to you?

03:40.504 --> 03:42.372
She's my sister.

03:47.745 --> 03:51.681
Ryan star: * dream,
send me a sign *

03:51.682 --> 03:53.817
* turn back the clock *

03:53.818 --> 03:56.519
* give me some time *

03:56.520 --> 03:59.489
* I need to break out *

03:59.490 --> 04:01.691
* and make a new name *

04:01.692 --> 04:04.327
* let's open our eyes *

04:04.328 --> 04:11.201
* to the brand-new day *

04:11.202 --> 04:14.337
Captioning made possible
by 20th century fox

04:22.346 --> 04:26.383
20 bucks says those
cops are here for ava.

04:26.384 --> 04:27.717
Ah, sisterly love.

04:27.718 --> 04:29.219
Half-sister.

04:29.220 --> 04:31.054
The degenerate paternal half.

04:31.055 --> 04:32.222
I.D., please.

04:32.223 --> 04:33.857
Thanks.

04:33.858 --> 04:35.659
Again, ava is in solitary.

04:35.660 --> 04:38.295
She's not allowed visitors.
No exceptions.

04:38.296 --> 04:39.896
Ok, well, can you just tell me

04:39.897 --> 04:41.631
If it had anything to do
with the cops that we saw?

04:41.632 --> 04:43.133
I really can't discuss it.

04:43.134 --> 04:44.968
Grow a pair.

04:44.969 --> 04:46.336
Excuse me?

04:46.337 --> 04:48.305
I was just telling her to
grow a pair, you know...

04:48.306 --> 04:49.406
Of testicles.

04:49.407 --> 04:50.740
Metaphorically speaking, you know,

04:50.741 --> 04:52.475
'cause you're stonewalling.

04:52.476 --> 04:54.411
Which is what people do when
they have something to hide.

04:54.412 --> 04:56.680
So what are you hiding?

04:56.681 --> 04:57.681
Enough of this. Come here.

04:57.682 --> 04:59.682
What are you doing?

05:02.253 --> 05:04.187
Ria, you have to come get me.

05:04.188 --> 05:05.322
Something happened.

05:05.323 --> 05:07.657
I'm not sure what,
but something bad.

05:07.658 --> 05:09.659
I'm not even supposed
to be on the phone.

05:09.660 --> 05:10.860
Please, I need-

05:14.932 --> 05:18.134
All I can tell you is
that ava's friend marly

05:18.135 --> 05:19.936
Seems to have run away last night.

05:19.937 --> 05:22.105
Oh, so you locked ava up?

05:22.106 --> 05:24.474
Why am I doing all the talking?

05:24.475 --> 05:28.445
I mean, she's your sister.
Go on, say something. Go on.

05:28.446 --> 05:30.246
All right.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.015
So you locked up my sister?

05:32.016 --> 05:33.616
Oh, that's brilliant, then.

05:33.617 --> 05:35.385
Until she decides to
share what she knows

05:35.386 --> 05:37.754
About how marly evaded
our security system, yes.

05:37.755 --> 05:40.390
You realize isolation will
reinforce her distrust

05:40.391 --> 05:43.793
Of authority and make her
even less likely to open up.

05:43.794 --> 05:45.595
You must be a psychologist.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.230
I must be.

05:47.231 --> 05:49.265
There's really nothing I can do.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.434
my sister,

05:51.435 --> 05:53.336
My baby sister.

05:53.337 --> 05:54.838
They won't let her eat.

05:54.839 --> 05:56.406
They won't let her sleep.

05:56.407 --> 05:58.108
The warden won't
even let me see her.

05:58.109 --> 06:00.176
She's so scared and alone,

06:00.177 --> 06:02.579
And now there's this
girl who's missing.

06:04.682 --> 06:06.683
now...

06:06.684 --> 06:08.284
You take me to ava,

06:08.285 --> 06:10.353
Or I'll take that phone
message and these tears

06:10.354 --> 06:13.022
To a friend of mine
at the local news.

06:19.029 --> 06:20.163
Dax.

06:20.164 --> 06:23.032
Tell dr. Burns ava has visitors.

06:23.033 --> 06:25.635
I'd like him to observe.

06:38.382 --> 06:41.384
What's with the old white guy?

06:41.385 --> 06:43.653
I'm your sister's boss.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.021
Yep. The lie guy?

06:45.022 --> 06:47.123
You brought the lie guy.

06:47.124 --> 06:48.525
Ava, what the hell
happened last night?

06:48.526 --> 06:49.426
Like you care.

06:49.427 --> 06:50.760
Hey, I'm here.

06:50.761 --> 06:53.062
I care.

06:56.267 --> 06:57.567
You're super sexy.

06:57.568 --> 06:59.202
You want to make out?

06:59.203 --> 07:01.471
Absolutely.
Climb on board, darling.

07:03.107 --> 07:04.174
She's testing him.

07:04.175 --> 07:06.509
Ya think?

07:07.178 --> 07:10.313
Sorry. I'll hold the condescension.

07:11.715 --> 07:13.216
You like making
people uncomfortable.

07:13.217 --> 07:14.217
Yeah, I do.

07:14.218 --> 07:16.185
How about you?

07:18.856 --> 07:19.856
Why so scared, then?

07:19.857 --> 07:21.424
I'm not scared.

07:21.425 --> 07:23.159
Come on, ava, the man
is a deception expert.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.795
Is it marly, eh?

07:26.931 --> 07:29.999
I'll take that as a yes, actually.

07:30.734 --> 07:33.102
You know, you remind
me of your sister

07:33.103 --> 07:34.337
2 years ago.

07:34.338 --> 07:35.538
You know, a completely open book,

07:35.539 --> 07:38.842
But trying desperately
to be inscrutable.

07:38.843 --> 07:42.212
So why did you leave a message
on your sister's machine?

07:42.213 --> 07:43.513
I wanted to get out of here.

07:43.514 --> 07:45.148
Look around. Why?

07:45.149 --> 07:48.251
I get in one cop's face one time,
they toss me in juvie.

07:48.252 --> 07:50.487
Oh, come on, that's
not all that happened.

07:50.488 --> 07:52.222
They share a dad.

07:52.223 --> 07:54.190
I gather he was pretty useless.

07:54.191 --> 07:55.391
Stage 4 alcoholic.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.527
Ava grew up being beaten

07:57.528 --> 07:58.828
During his blackouts.

07:58.829 --> 08:00.563
The mother o.D.'d when she was 10.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.265
Ava was in the next room.

08:02.266 --> 08:03.566
And then she went into the system

08:03.567 --> 08:05.235
When what she needed
was intensive therapy.

08:05.236 --> 08:06.903
The girl has been
here for 6 months.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.239
It's the first time
family's shown up.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.441
Dax should know.
He used to be a resident.

08:11.442 --> 08:13.243
Now I'm a success story.

08:13.244 --> 08:17.547
My social worker says I have a
recurrent shoplifting problem.

08:17.548 --> 08:18.781
Oh, yeah?

08:18.782 --> 08:20.149
I say this ass deserves good denim.

08:20.150 --> 08:21.618
Yeah, it's a nice ass.

08:21.619 --> 08:23.052
Hey.

08:23.053 --> 08:24.120
Anyway, if I need something,

08:24.121 --> 08:25.622
Who's gonna get it for me but me?

08:25.623 --> 08:26.689
Well, if wanted out of here so bad,

08:26.690 --> 08:27.957
Why did you call me and hang up?

08:27.958 --> 08:29.058
I heard somebody coming. I freaked.

08:29.059 --> 08:31.260
Where's marly?

08:33.964 --> 08:35.732
I don't know.

08:35.732 --> 08:36.866
I don't believe her.

08:36.866 --> 08:37.866
Do you?

08:37.868 --> 08:39.869
Not for a second.

08:41.205 --> 08:43.806
Fine. I saw marly last night.

08:43.807 --> 08:45.275
She was sneaking out.

08:46.277 --> 08:47.810
Oh.

08:47.811 --> 08:49.379
Crap.

08:49.380 --> 08:50.847
Lockdown. What's that?

08:55.119 --> 08:56.185
Someone's hurt, right?

08:56.186 --> 08:57.120
Yeah.

08:57.121 --> 08:58.888
Yeah, I'm a doctor.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.059
Let me guess.

09:03.060 --> 09:04.627
It's marly, right?

09:19.732 --> 09:21.333
Marly's dead.

09:22.084 --> 09:23.585
You can just say it.

09:23.586 --> 09:24.786
Somebody hit her in the head

09:24.787 --> 09:26.021
Hard enough to kill her.

09:26.022 --> 09:29.057
The police are investigating.

09:29.058 --> 09:30.525
whatever.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.794
You think they'll let me
go back to my room now?

09:32.795 --> 09:34.562
Ava...

09:34.563 --> 09:37.132
You said-you said that
you followed marly

09:37.133 --> 09:38.733
Last night when she snuck out.

09:38.734 --> 09:39.935
So?

09:39.936 --> 09:43.605
And your message said that
something bad happened.

09:43.606 --> 09:44.973
Ava, what did you see?

09:44.974 --> 09:46.808
Nothing.

09:46.809 --> 09:48.910
You're lying.

09:49.578 --> 09:52.547
She is- she is lying, right?

09:54.250 --> 09:55.417
All right, enough.

09:55.418 --> 09:56.651
This is ridiculous.

09:56.652 --> 09:57.819
My turn. Hey-

09:57.820 --> 09:58.987
What are you doing?!

09:58.988 --> 10:00.121
Lightman!

10:00.122 --> 10:01.156
you killed her, right?

10:01.157 --> 10:02.157
You killed marly, didn't you?

10:02.158 --> 10:03.858
Admit it. No, I didn't!

10:03.859 --> 10:05.493
You bashed her head in, didn't you?

10:05.494 --> 10:06.995
No, I didn't! You see,
I think you're brilliant.

10:06.996 --> 10:08.163
I'll give you that.
You're brilliant

10:08.164 --> 10:09.431
The way you manipulate your sister.

10:09.432 --> 10:10.732
I mean, you play on all that
guilt she carries around

10:10.733 --> 10:14.135
For not being able to protect
you from your father.

10:15.071 --> 10:17.305
But the funny thing is, right,

10:17.306 --> 10:19.907
I don't have that problem.

10:20.876 --> 10:22.944
Now, your friend is dead.

10:22.945 --> 10:24.846
You can play tough all you like,

10:24.847 --> 10:26.514
But you loved her.

10:26.515 --> 10:29.617
You loved her like a sister.

10:31.387 --> 10:33.688
That's why I'm gonna help you.

10:33.689 --> 10:35.957
But first you gotta
tell me what you know.

10:35.958 --> 10:38.493
You tell me or I'm gonna leave.

10:38.494 --> 10:40.462
I'm gonna leave,
you're sister's gonna leave,

10:40.463 --> 10:43.398
And you're gonna be stuck
here on you're own.

10:43.399 --> 10:45.066
And we will not come back,

10:45.067 --> 10:47.435
So tell me what you know.

10:47.970 --> 10:49.804
She was pregnant.

10:49.805 --> 10:50.905
Marly?

10:50.906 --> 10:51.973
Who's the father?

10:51.974 --> 10:53.041
I don't know.

10:53.042 --> 10:54.042
Lie.

10:54.043 --> 10:54.976
She was always crying

10:54.977 --> 10:57.045
After she'd visit dr. Burns.

10:57.046 --> 10:58.079
Ask him.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.882
That's not good enough. I'm off.

11:00.883 --> 11:02.484
Nice knowing you.

11:02.485 --> 11:04.919
Wait! Last night...

11:04.920 --> 11:08.223
I heard her scream.

11:08.224 --> 11:10.325
I didn't try to help her. I ran.

11:10.326 --> 11:12.327
I was scared.

11:12.328 --> 11:15.963
It's my fault she's dead.

11:18.701 --> 11:19.968
The police want to talk to me,

11:19.969 --> 11:21.369
And you have no
authority to be here.

11:21.370 --> 11:23.605
Actually, dr. Lightman is under
contract to the city of d.C.

11:23.606 --> 11:26.007
And I'll be liaising with
the metropolitan p.D.

11:26.008 --> 11:27.842
All right, enough with the
jurisdictional pissing contest.

11:27.843 --> 11:30.412
You got a murderer running
around in your facility.

11:30.413 --> 11:32.080
Which means that your
kids are in danger,

11:32.081 --> 11:34.349
And one of them happens to
be my associate's sister,

11:34.350 --> 11:36.484
Which makes you a
very lucky person,

11:36.485 --> 11:38.686
Because you need me.

11:38.687 --> 11:41.022
In that case, how can I help you?

11:41.023 --> 11:43.291
For starters, I'd like to see
the files of any juveniles here

11:43.292 --> 11:44.793
Who've been convicted
of violent crimes.

11:44.794 --> 11:46.261
I'll need approval from the police.

11:46.262 --> 11:47.429
Consider it done.

11:47.430 --> 11:48.863
In the meantime,

11:48.864 --> 11:51.166
Did you know that
marly was pregnant?

11:51.167 --> 11:52.667
No.

11:52.668 --> 11:55.036
Well, ava did.

11:55.037 --> 11:58.106
I bet she wasn't the only one, eh?

11:58.107 --> 12:00.275
Were you aware of this?

12:00.276 --> 12:02.277
Yes. I knew that one of
our girls was pregnant.

12:02.278 --> 12:05.313
I decided, hey,
I'll just keep that to myself.

12:05.314 --> 12:07.615
Well, do you have any
idea who the father is?

12:07.616 --> 12:10.985
Marly was disciplined for making
out with a kid named tyrel gardner

12:10.986 --> 12:14.188
In the chapel a few months ago.

12:17.293 --> 12:19.327
Tyrel. He might have
been the father,

12:19.328 --> 12:21.930
But he didn't kill marly.
He was released last month.

12:21.931 --> 12:24.199
There's no way he could have
gotten in here last night.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.501
Still, I'll pass on his information

12:26.502 --> 12:27.836
To the police.

12:27.837 --> 12:29.771
They can add him to
their interview list.

12:29.772 --> 12:32.340
Well, we all know these kids
aren't gonna talk to the cops.

12:32.341 --> 12:35.309
We need to go to the source.
We need to go to marly.

12:36.112 --> 12:38.179
Group therapy is confidential.

12:38.180 --> 12:39.981
Agent reynolds is
back at the office.

12:39.982 --> 12:41.316
I could give him a call.

12:41.317 --> 12:42.750
You can call whoever you like.

12:42.751 --> 12:44.486
It's still an invasion of privacy.

12:44.487 --> 12:45.787
A woman was murdered.

12:45.788 --> 12:46.988
Yes, I'm aware of that,

12:46.989 --> 12:48.423
And I'm the only one here
who actually knew her.

12:48.424 --> 12:49.824
How about a little flexibility?

12:49.825 --> 12:52.861
I'll-I'll show you one session.

12:52.862 --> 12:54.729
Marly's last.

12:55.865 --> 12:59.033
Lightman means well,
but he's slightly insane.

12:59.034 --> 13:00.301
Yeah, I noticed.

13:00.302 --> 13:02.871
Look, marly dying
wasn't your fault, ava.

13:02.872 --> 13:05.907
There's nothing you
could have done.

13:05.908 --> 13:08.042
What's wrong?

13:09.311 --> 13:11.946
Somebody went through my stuff.

13:11.947 --> 13:13.515
How can you tell?

13:13.516 --> 13:15.617
The kids here steal.
I leave things a certain way.

13:15.618 --> 13:18.920
Were they looking for something?

13:18.921 --> 13:20.321
Come on, come on, come on.

13:20.322 --> 13:21.923
Does someone think you
know who the killer is?

13:21.924 --> 13:22.924
Where is it?

13:25.761 --> 13:28.896
Ava, this is important.

13:30.299 --> 13:32.734
Weird things happen in this place.

13:32.735 --> 13:34.969
That's all I know.

13:36.272 --> 13:38.640
Dr. Burns: Ava,
why don't you start us all off

13:38.641 --> 13:40.675
By telling us about a good memory.

13:40.676 --> 13:43.311
Good memory?

13:43.312 --> 13:44.979
Um...

13:45.581 --> 13:47.282
Whenever my sister visited me,

13:47.283 --> 13:49.117
She'd braid my hair.

13:49.118 --> 13:52.854
After my dad had a bad night,
she'd do it for hours.

13:53.822 --> 13:58.226
Dr. Burns: Why does ava's
memory bother you, marly?

13:58.227 --> 13:59.861
The girl's ass being beaten.

13:59.862 --> 14:02.263
Who cares about hair-braiding.

14:02.264 --> 14:03.998
Marly really didn't like you,
did she, eh?

14:03.999 --> 14:05.934
I'm not here to be liked.

14:05.935 --> 14:09.170
Whenever ria stayed with us,
she got the worst of it.

14:09.171 --> 14:11.539
I remember that.

14:11.540 --> 14:14.542
She probably took it on purpose,
to protect you.

14:14.543 --> 14:16.878
Will you pause it.

14:17.646 --> 14:19.847
That's, um, that's
maurice jones, right?

14:19.848 --> 14:21.015
I just flagged his file.

14:21.016 --> 14:22.483
Dad's in jail.

14:22.484 --> 14:24.852
Background of substance abuse.

14:24.853 --> 14:27.255
He has 3 arrests for assault.

14:27.256 --> 14:29.591
You could have said the same
thing about me a while back.

14:29.592 --> 14:31.993
Could we also say that you
bludgeoned your pregnant neighbor

14:31.994 --> 14:34.062
Into a coma?

14:34.063 --> 14:36.598
Man, you got no right
gettin' in my face!

14:36.599 --> 14:38.700
You ain't gonna find nothing.

14:38.701 --> 14:41.002
Get off me, man.

14:43.005 --> 14:46.040
Hey, man, that ain't mine!
That's not mine.

14:46.041 --> 14:48.276
Maurice jones, you are under arrest
for the murder of marly lourdes.

14:48.277 --> 14:49.410
I didn't hurt that girl!

14:49.411 --> 14:50.511
You see that, right?

14:50.512 --> 14:51.579
Yeah. Go on, then.

14:51.580 --> 14:52.513
Anything you say can
be used against you...

14:52.514 --> 14:54.315
Excuse me. He's telling the truth.

14:54.316 --> 14:55.917
Ma'am, please step away.

14:55.918 --> 14:57.685
No, we're deception experts.
Trust me, you have the wrong person.

14:57.686 --> 14:59.254
That's what I'm saying.

14:59.255 --> 15:00.955
Newsflash for you, lady - they
always say they didn't do it.

15:00.956 --> 15:03.090
I didn't kill nobody!

15:06.061 --> 15:08.630
If maurice is innocent, there's a
murderer running around this place,

15:08.631 --> 15:11.633
And I'm not leaving ava a sitting duck.
I'm calling reynolds.

15:11.634 --> 15:13.101
No, forget reynolds.

15:13.102 --> 15:16.904
Foster, could you take torres
back to the office, please?

15:16.905 --> 15:17.905
Why?

15:17.906 --> 15:19.107
Now.

15:19.108 --> 15:22.143
Give me your keys.

15:27.783 --> 15:30.384
That was touching.

15:33.822 --> 15:36.924
How are you at
following instructions?

15:41.864 --> 15:43.431
Stay close to the railing.

15:43.432 --> 15:45.199
It's a dead zone for the cameras.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.434
Where's ria?

15:46.435 --> 15:47.602
She's back at the office.

15:47.603 --> 15:49.270
It's just me and you now.

15:49.271 --> 15:50.805
I'm going to break you out of here.

15:50.806 --> 15:52.507
And then what?

15:52.508 --> 15:54.508
Then we catch a killer.

15:58.173 --> 15:59.473
I mean, all day not one of you

15:59.474 --> 16:00.708
Thought to say, hey, let's just

16:00.709 --> 16:02.576
Call eli and tell him why
nobody's in the office.

16:02.577 --> 16:04.178
Loker, a girl was murdered.

16:04.179 --> 16:05.613
Well, that's exactly my point.

16:05.614 --> 16:09.349
It's a scary world.
Bad things happen.

16:09.350 --> 16:10.950
I- I worry.

16:10.951 --> 16:12.752
And apparently you have a sister.

16:12.753 --> 16:14.254
Half-sister.

16:14.255 --> 16:16.556
All right, so, if, um,
this maurice kid

16:16.557 --> 16:18.858
With the proclivity toward
violence was framed,

16:18.859 --> 16:20.860
Then who killed this pregnant girl?

16:20.861 --> 16:23.196
The youth center
psychologist is a maybe.

16:23.197 --> 16:27.700
Uh, there was definitely something
between him and marly on those tapes.

16:27.701 --> 16:29.202
All right, well,
I'll call the deputy warden,

16:29.203 --> 16:31.104
See if I can sweet-talk her
into giving you more access.

16:31.105 --> 16:32.772
Why don't you not.

16:32.773 --> 16:34.840
Oh, look, is this little torres?

16:37.845 --> 16:40.713
You know, I just remembered,
I got some work to do downtown.

16:40.714 --> 16:43.182
And I'm gonna pretend
like I never even saw her.

16:43.183 --> 16:44.517
You call me if you need me.

16:44.518 --> 16:45.918
I've got some research to do.

16:45.919 --> 16:48.488
You could be charged
with aiding and abetting.

16:48.489 --> 16:49.919
Or kidnapping.

16:49.991 --> 16:50.957
Yeah.

16:50.958 --> 16:52.826
Well, I've been charged with worse.

16:52.827 --> 16:54.928
Sorry. If I did get
killed like marly,

16:54.929 --> 16:56.129
Your life would get easier.

16:56.130 --> 16:58.098
You're embarrassing me in
front of my bosses, ok?

16:58.099 --> 17:00.000
Yeah, I don't think she cares.

17:00.001 --> 17:02.235
Fyi-I'm not staying with you.

17:02.236 --> 17:03.870
All right, tell me where
you're gonna stay, then,

17:03.871 --> 17:04.971
Some lowlife boyfriends?

17:04.972 --> 17:07.073
I'm staying with cal.

17:09.542 --> 17:12.545
Now, don't go thinking that this
is a get out of jail free pass,

17:12.546 --> 17:14.146
'cause it's not.
As soon as this is solved,

17:14.147 --> 17:15.749
You're going straight back inside.
In the meantime,

17:15.750 --> 17:17.851
You're staying with foster.

17:17.852 --> 17:19.118
What?

17:19.119 --> 17:21.621
You heard me.

17:21.622 --> 17:23.823
I suggest you leave.

17:24.358 --> 17:28.161
Ok. You must be hungry.

17:28.162 --> 17:29.329
Oh, uh, foster,

17:29.330 --> 17:31.731
Why don't you get dr.
Burns on the phone

17:31.732 --> 17:33.666
And have him come in here.

17:33.667 --> 17:36.069
I believe you have his number.

17:36.070 --> 17:37.103
She should be staying with me.

17:37.104 --> 17:39.005
What? No, I'm not.
No, you're off the case.

17:39.006 --> 17:40.273
Yeah, you are. You had your
chance and you blew it.

17:40.274 --> 17:42.842
You're too close to
this to see clearly.

17:42.843 --> 17:45.445
Plus, she's gonna be fighting
you every step of the way.

17:45.446 --> 17:46.913
So...

17:46.914 --> 17:48.948
Go home, torres.

17:48.949 --> 17:51.718
I mean that.

17:54.422 --> 17:56.689
I told you I didn't
know marly was pregnant.

17:56.690 --> 17:58.691
Not only did you know she was pregnant,
I think you're the father.

18:00.027 --> 18:01.361
I don't care what you think,

18:01.362 --> 18:02.695
And I have to get back to work.

18:02.696 --> 18:04.030
No, you don't have
to get back to work,

18:04.031 --> 18:05.965
And you do care what I think.
Why is that, exactly?

18:05.966 --> 18:07.867
Look, I don't even have to be here.

18:07.868 --> 18:09.269
Why are you, then?

18:09.270 --> 18:12.038
Dr. Foster said you
wanted maurice's file.

18:12.039 --> 18:14.374
You got the hots for foster.

18:14.375 --> 18:17.477
I cared about marly and
I wanted to help her.

18:17.478 --> 18:19.412
Now tell the truth, burnsy.
I mean, assuming

18:19.413 --> 18:23.316
That you're not the father, I can put
in a good word for you with foster.

18:23.317 --> 18:25.552
you're kind of a jerk.

18:25.553 --> 18:26.953
Yeah, I have been told that.

18:26.954 --> 18:28.688
I get it, though.

18:28.689 --> 18:30.824
I get it. You're embarrassed.

18:30.825 --> 18:32.559
You're probably also embarrassed

18:32.560 --> 18:34.861
That marly made you
all hot and bothered.

18:34.862 --> 18:38.398
Marly was a kid. I never touched
her and I never wanted to.

18:38.399 --> 18:41.101
That's actually true.

18:41.102 --> 18:42.836
All right, then...

18:42.837 --> 18:45.638
You're not the father.

18:45.639 --> 18:48.341
What about this tyrel kid?

18:48.342 --> 18:50.410
You don't even know that,
do you? I mean-

18:50.411 --> 18:52.212
So what's all this guilt
that I'm seeing, then?

18:52.213 --> 18:55.215
I'm a psychologist.

18:55.216 --> 18:59.052
My conversations with the
kids are confidential.

18:59.053 --> 19:01.121
It's important that they trust me.

19:01.122 --> 19:03.556
Ethics.

19:03.557 --> 19:06.893
That's always so inconvenient.

19:06.894 --> 19:08.561
All right, how about this, then?

19:08.562 --> 19:12.198
When...Did marly tell you
that she was pregnant?

19:12.199 --> 19:13.733
And she did tell you. I know,

19:13.734 --> 19:16.402
Because you got evasive
as all hell earlier.

19:20.374 --> 19:23.543
3 weeks ago.

19:23.544 --> 19:25.478
She begged me not to tell anyone.

19:25.479 --> 19:27.947
I should have reported
it to the deputy warden.

19:27.948 --> 19:31.417
Marly would have been
transferred to another facility

19:31.418 --> 19:33.153
And maybe she wouldn't be dead.

19:33.154 --> 19:36.823
I didn't want to be one more
person who'd betrayed her.

19:36.824 --> 19:38.024
Can I go now?

19:38.025 --> 19:39.058
No. Whatever it is,

19:39.059 --> 19:43.095
You're not leaving
till you say it. So...

19:44.832 --> 19:47.233
The father of marly's baby,
whoever it was,

19:47.234 --> 19:49.769
One of her friends
had a crush on him.

19:49.770 --> 19:51.104
It seemed to cause a rift.

19:51.105 --> 19:53.039
Friend?

19:53.574 --> 19:55.275
Ava.

19:55.276 --> 19:57.777
I don't know for sure.

20:03.918 --> 20:05.718
I shouldn't be telling you this,

20:05.719 --> 20:09.088
Because you're just a child
and you need to be protected.

20:09.089 --> 20:11.224
Uh, my dad's on his way.

20:11.225 --> 20:13.793
I bet he is. I bet you just call
and he comes running in, huh?

20:13.794 --> 20:16.062
Because that's the
kind of dad he is,

20:16.063 --> 20:17.931
A come-runninger.

20:17.932 --> 20:21.000
Can I-can I get you some coffee?

20:21.001 --> 20:24.470
My dad is a run-the-other-wayer.

20:24.471 --> 20:26.506
After he smacks you, of course.

20:26.507 --> 20:30.076
Smack first,
then run the other way.

20:30.544 --> 20:34.147
Oh. Daddy's home.

20:34.148 --> 20:35.281
Hi, em. Good job.

20:35.282 --> 20:37.150
Go to your room.

20:37.151 --> 20:38.918
If you drove here, you're fired.

20:38.919 --> 20:40.820
Hey. Oh- I took a taxi.

20:40.821 --> 20:41.988
I'm a responsible drunk.

20:41.989 --> 20:43.356
Yeah, clearly.

20:43.357 --> 20:45.925
Don't be mad at me.
I need to tell you something.

20:45.926 --> 20:46.926
Not bloody likely.

20:46.927 --> 20:48.328
Let me go. Get off of me.

20:48.329 --> 20:49.462
Ah!

20:49.463 --> 20:51.464
What are you doing

20:51.465 --> 20:53.766
Drunk off your face in my house

20:53.767 --> 20:55.268
With my daughter?

20:55.269 --> 20:59.472
I- I had nowhere else to go.

21:00.341 --> 21:02.775
You're a good dad, you know.

21:02.776 --> 21:03.776
Yeah, that's not the point.

21:03.777 --> 21:06.079
You're a good man.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.615
You are. You try to hide it,
but you are.

21:08.616 --> 21:11.551
Just tell me why you're here,
all right?

21:11.552 --> 21:15.521
You don't have to be so
mean to me, you know.

21:16.657 --> 21:19.292
I'm so cold.

21:19.293 --> 21:23.062
Maybe you want to warm me up, cal.

21:23.063 --> 21:25.398
You stop that right now.

21:27.501 --> 21:29.402
Tell my why you're here!

21:29.403 --> 21:30.837
Oh, my god.

21:30.838 --> 21:32.572
I'm sorry.

21:32.573 --> 21:35.074
I'm sorry, dr. Lightman. I'm sorry.

21:35.075 --> 21:39.112
The torres twins.

21:39.113 --> 21:41.648
They fire themselves at
me from left and right.

21:41.649 --> 21:44.083
How'd I get so lucky?

21:46.987 --> 21:48.454
It's my sister.

21:48.455 --> 21:51.391
She makes me crazy.

21:51.392 --> 21:54.294
You're two sides of the
same coin, you know?

21:54.295 --> 21:56.162
No, we're not.

21:56.163 --> 21:57.730
Your dad taught you
to see the truth.

21:57.731 --> 21:59.599
He didn't teach me anything.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.301
And he taught ava how to lie.

22:01.302 --> 22:03.403
Look, I want to believe her.

22:03.404 --> 22:04.904
I do. I want to believe her,

22:04.905 --> 22:06.906
But that girl has lied
to me so many times.

22:06.907 --> 22:08.741
You know, a couple of years ago,

22:08.742 --> 22:10.243
She stayed with me.

22:10.244 --> 22:12.078
She gave her boyfriend my key,

22:12.079 --> 22:13.646
And he cleaned me out.

22:13.647 --> 22:16.916
She says that he
wanted to come over

22:16.917 --> 22:18.918
And watch football on
the cable or whatever,

22:18.919 --> 22:21.954
But I bet you she helped him carry
everything I own to the curb.

22:21.955 --> 22:24.857
Well, did you ever consider
the vague possibility

22:24.858 --> 22:28.628
That the bit about the
game might be true

22:28.629 --> 22:32.265
And that her boyfriend just
took advantage of her trust?

22:32.266 --> 22:33.833
Here, drink that.

22:35.135 --> 22:37.470
And frankly,

22:37.471 --> 22:40.940
I'm more curious about
what you did to her.

22:40.941 --> 22:43.009
Look, ava's a liar

22:43.010 --> 22:44.010
And a manipulator,

22:44.011 --> 22:45.778
And she works every angle she can.

22:45.779 --> 22:47.380
It doesn't matter who she hurts.

22:47.381 --> 22:50.717
Actually, she's kind
of just like you.

22:50.718 --> 22:54.220
You know, you might be right there.

22:54.221 --> 22:56.456
But what if she's involved
in marly's murder some way

22:56.457 --> 22:57.890
And we helped her escape?

22:57.891 --> 23:01.093
She could be halfway to new
york in foster's car by now.

23:03.163 --> 23:05.098
Ria always thinks
everything's my fault.

23:05.099 --> 23:08.067
I'm sure that's not true.

23:08.736 --> 23:09.769
We never lived together

23:09.770 --> 23:11.537
'cause we didn't have the same mom,

23:11.538 --> 23:14.273
But when I was little,
she would always come by,

23:14.274 --> 23:17.143
Help me with my homework.

23:19.513 --> 23:21.414
She does love you, you know.

23:21.415 --> 23:24.383
Yeah, I guess.

23:25.119 --> 23:27.320
So what do you want
for dessert? Hmm?

23:27.321 --> 23:29.021
What do you got?

23:29.022 --> 23:31.190
Well, I have got...

23:31.191 --> 23:32.759
Some ice cream, of course,

23:32.760 --> 23:34.227
But I also have-

23:34.228 --> 23:35.428
Aah!

23:35.429 --> 23:37.930
Let me go! Put her down!

23:37.931 --> 23:38.931
Get her!

23:42.102 --> 23:45.405
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

23:45.406 --> 23:46.572
The egg! Where is it?

23:47.574 --> 23:49.642
Now tie her up!

23:49.643 --> 23:51.511
I'm trying! She's strong!

23:52.546 --> 23:53.846
Ava!

23:53.847 --> 23:55.114
Shut up!

23:55.115 --> 23:56.516
Don't put your hand on me,
you little bitch!

23:56.517 --> 23:57.650
I got it! No!

23:57.651 --> 23:59.852
Let's go, I got it! Aah!

23:59.853 --> 24:01.687
Ohh! Ohh!

24:01.688 --> 24:03.222
Ava!

24:11.242 --> 24:12.575
Foster? Foster!

24:12.576 --> 24:14.744
Yeah! I'm in here.

24:14.745 --> 24:17.780
Jeez. What the bloody
hell happened here?

24:21.852 --> 24:22.852
You all right, love?

24:22.853 --> 24:25.521
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

24:25.522 --> 24:26.956
I'm fine. I'm fine.

24:26.957 --> 24:28.291
Everything's...

24:28.292 --> 24:30.326
Everything's, uh... Is fine.

24:30.327 --> 24:32.261
You all right?

24:35.165 --> 24:36.532
You should be proud.

24:36.533 --> 24:39.368
You know, she got
me out of my ropes.

24:39.369 --> 24:40.803
She untied me.

24:40.804 --> 24:42.638
Yeah.

24:42.639 --> 24:44.841
Good thing she was here.

24:44.842 --> 24:46.242
I had nothing to do with this.

24:46.243 --> 24:48.211
Oh, no? 'cause I
find it very strange,

24:48.212 --> 24:50.213
The one night you come
and you stay with foster,

24:50.214 --> 24:52.048
Somebody decides to come
to break into her house.

24:52.049 --> 24:54.116
Ria! It was tyrel,
wasn't it? You called him-

24:54.117 --> 24:55.785
I had nothing to do with this!

24:55.786 --> 24:57.687
Stop it! You called him!
He was here!

24:57.688 --> 24:59.021
Hey! Don't defend her.

24:59.022 --> 25:01.991
You knock it off.

25:05.062 --> 25:06.729
Ava...

25:06.730 --> 25:08.831
Was just as terrified as I was,

25:08.832 --> 25:11.801
And she had no idea this was
gonna happen or who they were.

25:11.802 --> 25:14.436
Just no idea!

25:15.239 --> 25:16.873
I'm sorry.

25:16.874 --> 25:19.809
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

25:25.716 --> 25:26.883
You all right, love?

25:26.884 --> 25:29.018
Come here, darling.

25:30.420 --> 25:31.787
It's all good, darling.

25:31.788 --> 25:33.289
It's all good.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.124
No.

25:35.125 --> 25:37.793
Hmm?

25:39.229 --> 25:40.630
Ohh...

25:40.631 --> 25:42.131
I had no idea you
were such a crybaby.

25:47.871 --> 25:50.206
Cal, they were just kids.
They were kids.

25:50.207 --> 25:52.942
I could tell by their voices.
There were-there were-

25:52.943 --> 25:54.577
There were 3 boys and a girl.

25:54.578 --> 25:56.946
From covington, hey?

25:56.947 --> 25:58.814
Where the bloody hell
are the cops, then?

25:58.815 --> 26:00.583
No, they're just gonna
take ava back to juvie,

26:00.584 --> 26:03.786
And then they'll arrest you
for taking her from there.

26:03.787 --> 26:05.321
We can take care
of this on our own.

26:05.322 --> 26:06.689
Well, yeah, but,

26:06.690 --> 26:08.658
Well, you're supposed to be
the sensible one, you know?

26:08.659 --> 26:11.460
Yeah, and you're supposed
to take unnecessary risks.

26:11.461 --> 26:13.429
Not when it comes to you.

26:19.670 --> 26:23.739
Oh, they were looking for this egg,
this little jeweled egg

26:23.740 --> 26:25.308
That ava had in her pocket,

26:25.309 --> 26:26.509
And I called reynolds

26:26.510 --> 26:28.277
And he's gonna put
it into the system

26:28.278 --> 26:29.745
And see what he can find out.

26:29.746 --> 26:31.213
What's so bloody
important about an egg?

26:31.214 --> 26:32.548
Ava won't talk about it.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.550
Well, she'll talk to me.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.285
No, she won't.

26:36.286 --> 26:38.354
Ava's gone.

26:40.791 --> 26:42.858
Right, so now we think ava's evil.

26:42.859 --> 26:44.160
No, no, loker.

26:44.161 --> 26:46.529
She's just a confused
and scared girl

26:46.530 --> 26:48.297
Who got overwhelmed and...

26:48.298 --> 26:50.633
I don't know what I think.

26:50.634 --> 26:52.668
We got company.

26:53.704 --> 26:56.038
Oh, he works for the deputy warden.

26:56.039 --> 26:57.273
Hey.

26:57.274 --> 26:58.674
It's dax, right?

26:58.675 --> 27:00.376
Can I help you?

27:00.377 --> 27:01.978
It's the group therapy
sessions you wanted.

27:01.979 --> 27:03.012
Oh.

27:03.013 --> 27:04.146
You didn't get 'em from me.

27:04.147 --> 27:06.815
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
Let's talk.

27:09.686 --> 27:11.153
You sure you don't want sound?

27:11.154 --> 27:14.090
Right now I'm only interested
in their physicality.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.925
Dax took a big risk
bringing these here.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.760
Why would he do that?

27:17.761 --> 27:19.695
You're the shrink.

27:19.696 --> 27:22.164
Sometimes I wish I
were a fortune-teller.

27:22.165 --> 27:23.332
Freeze it.

27:23.333 --> 27:25.334
Her.

27:25.335 --> 27:27.202
Will you bring her up.

27:28.972 --> 27:31.073
You see how she
shifts her shoulders

27:31.074 --> 27:33.042
When she's confronted?

27:33.043 --> 27:34.877
Will you bring up the sound.

27:36.346 --> 27:39.382
You go into a store,

27:39.383 --> 27:42.084
Take, like, a lip gloss.

27:42.085 --> 27:45.621
You got no idea how
much crap I take.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.523
It ain't even hard.

27:47.524 --> 27:51.293
Her voice was muffled
underneath the mask, but, yeah.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.496
Yeah, that's her.

27:53.497 --> 27:56.665
She was at my house.

28:00.003 --> 28:01.837
Look, she'll be here.

28:01.838 --> 28:03.539
I told you,
whenever ava gets upset,

28:03.540 --> 28:04.640
This is where she comes.

28:04.641 --> 28:07.676
I've found her here
like a hundred times.

28:08.578 --> 28:10.713
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened to foster.

28:10.714 --> 28:14.316
I - I don't know, I should have
known better than to trust ava.

28:14.317 --> 28:15.818
All right, get out.

28:15.819 --> 28:16.919
Wait a minute.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.454
Get out or grow up.
It's your choice.

28:18.455 --> 28:19.989
What-how am I not grown up?

28:19.990 --> 28:22.091
I have a job, I have an apartment,

28:22.092 --> 28:24.794
I pay my bills on time.
What more do you want from me?

28:24.795 --> 28:25.728
All right, let me see. Ahem.

28:25.729 --> 28:26.896
Your sister's missing,

28:26.897 --> 28:28.831
Foster's been attacked,

28:28.832 --> 28:29.999
I've committed a felony,

28:30.000 --> 28:33.169
You set a horrific
example for my daughter,

28:33.170 --> 28:36.172
And you tried to stick
your tongue down my throat.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.641
And not once in this
entire adventure

28:38.642 --> 28:40.142
Have you been honest.

28:40.143 --> 28:42.978
Now, see, that's what I'm
talking about, right there.

28:42.979 --> 28:44.447
I mean, this isn't
about your sister.

28:44.448 --> 28:46.248
This all about you, isn't it?

28:46.249 --> 28:47.283
Look, I just...

28:47.284 --> 28:48.918
I can't be what she needs.

28:48.919 --> 28:50.486
Well, it strikes me all she needs

28:50.487 --> 28:52.121
Is for you to believe
her for 2 seconds.

28:52.122 --> 28:54.190
I mean, if you can't do that,
you might as well hand in your cards

28:54.191 --> 28:57.226
And resign as big sister.

29:00.330 --> 29:01.864
There she is.

29:03.633 --> 29:05.868
Wait, no.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.737
Let's see what she does first.

29:19.950 --> 29:22.451
That's-that's tyrel.

29:34.865 --> 29:36.098
Oh, my god.

29:36.099 --> 29:39.043
Well, that doesn't bode well.

29:41.074 --> 29:44.142
If you were a guest in my home,

29:44.610 --> 29:46.411
This is what I would do.

29:46.412 --> 29:49.080
I'd offer you a drink.

29:49.081 --> 29:51.549
Soda rots your teeth.

29:51.550 --> 29:52.650
The point is to be welcoming,

29:52.651 --> 29:55.019
And you didn't give me
that chance earlier.

29:56.455 --> 30:00.158
I know you were in my house, amber.

30:00.159 --> 30:02.961
You and 3 boys from covington.

30:02.962 --> 30:05.229
You don't know nothin'.

30:10.136 --> 30:12.437
You know what I know?

30:12.438 --> 30:15.340
I know that the turn of your
arm when you pull that chair,

30:15.341 --> 30:17.976
It's pretty distinctive.

30:17.977 --> 30:19.644
And I saw it just now.

30:19.645 --> 30:22.380
And I saw it at my house.

30:22.381 --> 30:24.415
Dr. Foster's good.

30:24.416 --> 30:25.750
Yeah, she's the best.

30:25.751 --> 30:28.453
Well, second-best.

30:28.454 --> 30:29.821
Thanks for bringing amber by.

30:29.822 --> 30:31.022
These are my kids.

30:31.023 --> 30:33.424
If amber's in trouble,
I want to know.

30:33.425 --> 30:35.126
Tell me about that egg.

30:35.928 --> 30:37.962
I don't know nothin' about that.

30:37.963 --> 30:40.265
Just that we had to get it.

30:40.266 --> 30:42.867
Yeah? Who's we?

30:44.302 --> 30:46.904
Amber, I can see you
want to tell me.

30:46.905 --> 30:49.006
Look at me.

30:49.007 --> 30:50.574
Look at me!

30:51.109 --> 30:54.078
I think you owe me.

30:57.249 --> 30:59.783
The crew, ok?

31:00.352 --> 31:02.787
One night...

31:02.788 --> 31:05.456
Every few weeks, we...

31:05.457 --> 31:07.091
Break into houses,

31:07.092 --> 31:10.828
Take stuff rich folks
spend millions on.

31:10.829 --> 31:12.997
Who runs this crew?

31:12.998 --> 31:14.865
Somebody's gotta get
you out of there.

31:14.866 --> 31:16.467
I don't know.
I ain't upper management.

31:16.468 --> 31:20.671
What do you get in return
for your participation?

31:21.606 --> 31:23.574
Early release.

31:24.910 --> 31:30.014
You can get, like,
months off your time.

31:30.649 --> 31:32.883
Who signs off on early release?

31:32.884 --> 31:34.452
The deputy warden,
but she'd never be involved

31:34.453 --> 31:37.721
In something like this.

31:42.527 --> 31:45.029
I need to know who runs the crew.

31:47.032 --> 31:49.967
I know you're scared,
but I can protect you.

31:51.269 --> 31:53.270
Look at your face, bitch.

31:53.271 --> 31:57.875
You can't even protect yourself.

31:59.578 --> 32:01.846
You found her.

32:01.847 --> 32:04.315
Yeah, safe and sound in
the custody of the fbi.

32:04.316 --> 32:06.183
Me and tyrel weren't
doing anything wrong.

32:06.184 --> 32:08.719
Yeah, well, you weren't doing
anything right, either, were you?

32:08.720 --> 32:10.320
Come on, this way.

32:17.095 --> 32:19.363
Come on, ava, I saw you.

32:19.364 --> 32:21.832
I saw you put the mask on.

32:21.833 --> 32:23.400
Were you about to rob someone?

32:23.401 --> 32:24.835
No.

32:24.836 --> 32:27.671
I didn't know anything about what
they were doing till tonight.

32:27.672 --> 32:29.774
Tyrel told me.

32:29.775 --> 32:31.876
Go on.

32:31.877 --> 32:35.112
I just wanted to know
what it felt like.

32:35.113 --> 32:38.749
They put on these masks
and they have the power.

32:38.750 --> 32:41.418
I just wanted to feel that,

32:41.419 --> 32:43.921
Just for a minute.

32:44.923 --> 32:47.057
Ok, ok. Ok.

32:47.058 --> 32:49.260
But help me.

32:49.261 --> 32:51.529
You are involved, ava.
You had the egg.

32:51.530 --> 32:53.531
I was just trying to help marly.

32:53.532 --> 32:56.367
I promised her I would keep it.

32:56.368 --> 32:59.937
But I didn't do anything.

33:01.740 --> 33:03.607
I believe you.

33:06.678 --> 33:08.646
Look, I'm on your side, ok?

33:08.647 --> 33:11.248
And I'm sorry,
I know I don't deserve this,

33:11.249 --> 33:13.250
But will you please trust me.

33:13.251 --> 33:15.419
Please.

33:17.689 --> 33:20.558
You a man, tyrel?
Bet you think you're a real man.

33:20.559 --> 33:22.226
I got news for you.
You're not a man at all.

33:22.227 --> 33:24.461
'cause real men,
they don't let women

33:24.462 --> 33:27.198
Fight their battles for them.

33:27.199 --> 33:28.732
You're a little boy.

33:28.733 --> 33:30.467
Say that again and
you're a dead man.

33:30.468 --> 33:33.103
You're a little boy.
You're a little...Boy.

33:33.972 --> 33:35.906
And you're terrified to boot.

33:35.907 --> 33:39.109
'cause men, they admit
it when they're afraid.

33:39.110 --> 33:41.278
So...

33:41.279 --> 33:44.381
Be a man, tyrel.

33:46.952 --> 33:50.821
Tyrel, just tell them
what you told me.

33:53.491 --> 33:57.461
I was recruited to the crew
when I first got to covington.

33:57.462 --> 33:58.963
A few months ago we did a job.

33:58.964 --> 34:00.431
Some serious stuff went down.

34:00.432 --> 34:01.966
A guy died.

34:01.967 --> 34:03.601
The man's name was richard grange.

34:03.602 --> 34:05.402
And according to insurance reports,

34:05.403 --> 34:07.271
That fancy egg was
stolen from his house.

34:07.272 --> 34:09.940
Yeah, I kept it. Thought I might
need it for leverage one day.

34:09.940 --> 34:12.576
So you gave marly the egg
to protect her, is that it?

34:12.577 --> 34:14.344
And you told her to blow
the whistle on everything

34:14.346 --> 34:16.513
If she didn't get early release?

34:16.514 --> 34:17.748
I just wanted her
to get out of there.

34:17.748 --> 34:18.681
Because she was pregnant.

34:18.683 --> 34:20.717
Why didn't you just tell me?

34:20.719 --> 34:22.018
The same reason I wouldn't tell you

34:22.020 --> 34:23.454
Who marly's baby daddy was.

34:23.455 --> 34:25.188
I promised her I wouldn't.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.324
And I keep my promises.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.328
You know, I think
it's time you told me

34:31.329 --> 34:34.031
Who you're afraid of.

34:43.809 --> 34:46.110
He can't get you here.
You'll be safe.

34:46.112 --> 34:48.313
Who? What is going on?

34:48.313 --> 34:51.716
Dax killed marly.

34:51.717 --> 34:53.518
He wouldn't do that.

34:53.518 --> 34:56.221
No, I know all about
the home invasion crew.

34:56.222 --> 34:58.690
I know that, um,
dax was forcing you

34:58.691 --> 35:01.292
To sign early release papers. So...

35:01.293 --> 35:03.361
Please.

35:03.362 --> 35:04.929
I'll lose my job.

35:04.930 --> 35:07.966
I...I didn't have a choice.

35:07.967 --> 35:10.468
Well, whatever he's got
on you must be good, eh?

35:10.469 --> 35:13.471
He-he threatened my family.

35:13.472 --> 35:16.141
My parents are in assisted living,

35:16.142 --> 35:19.144
And dax said all I had
to do was sign the papers

35:19.145 --> 35:20.845
And leave the service
door unlocked.

35:20.846 --> 35:22.647
All right.

35:22.648 --> 35:23.815
Well, I don't want
you to get bored,

35:23.816 --> 35:26.084
So let's watch the telly, shall we?

35:26.619 --> 35:27.852
You know,

35:27.853 --> 35:30.054
People have killed
for this damn egg.

35:30.055 --> 35:31.156
You killed for it.

35:31.157 --> 35:32.624
No, man.

35:32.625 --> 35:36.194
What happened at the house,
it was an accident.

35:36.195 --> 35:37.829
All right, the man came at me.

35:37.830 --> 35:40.198
I pushed back.

35:40.199 --> 35:43.034
And he went over.

35:43.035 --> 35:46.938
After that, I told
her I wanted to stop.

35:46.939 --> 35:48.806
But she wouldn't let me.

35:49.542 --> 35:50.975
What is going on?

35:50.976 --> 35:52.310
Oh, didn't I mention it?

35:52.311 --> 35:53.645
Uh, your assistant-

35:53.646 --> 35:56.214
Dax-he was arrested a
couple of hours ago.

35:56.215 --> 35:58.082
But you said that he
was coming after me.

35:58.083 --> 35:59.584
Oh, yeah, big time.

35:59.585 --> 36:01.019
Yeah, he blames you for everything.

36:01.020 --> 36:04.022
Even says you killed marly.

36:04.023 --> 36:07.559
Is that why you brought me here,

36:07.560 --> 36:11.162
To accuse me of murder?

36:11.997 --> 36:13.731
Let me out of here right now!

36:13.732 --> 36:16.100
No, just keep watching,
'cause this is a really good bit.

36:16.101 --> 36:18.636
You know, dr. Foster says

36:18.637 --> 36:21.706
That you were the one that brought
in the group therapy tapes.

36:21.707 --> 36:23.942
I mean, that was a big
break in the case.

36:23.943 --> 36:26.110
Why the sudden lack
of self-preservation?

36:26.111 --> 36:28.980
I told you that I
wanted it to be over.

36:28.981 --> 36:32.750
I wanted her to get
what she deserves.

36:33.586 --> 36:35.987
You know, the funny
thing is, right,

36:35.988 --> 36:39.524
That every word that comes
out of that kid's mouth

36:39.525 --> 36:40.692
Is the truth,

36:40.693 --> 36:42.694
And every word that
comes out of yours

36:42.695 --> 36:43.895
Is a lie.

36:43.896 --> 36:46.431
This is gonna be very
embarrassing for you.

36:46.432 --> 36:47.866
Really?

36:47.867 --> 36:49.968
Everyone knows that I've sacrificed
everything for these kids.

36:49.969 --> 36:51.336
And that pisses you off,
doesn't it?

36:51.337 --> 36:52.971
You remember ava's sister?

36:52.972 --> 36:54.005
You know what pisses me off?

36:54.006 --> 36:56.407
People who hurt the people I love.

36:56.408 --> 36:57.809
I am the victim here.

36:57.810 --> 37:01.379
No, you're the one with
the massive bank account.

37:01.380 --> 37:02.981
Of course, it's not in your name.

37:02.982 --> 37:06.451
But the fbi have a hell of a knack
of tracking these things down.

37:06.452 --> 37:08.319
I have given everything to my job,
to the kids.

37:08.320 --> 37:11.289
I have given my whole life to them.

37:25.938 --> 37:28.106
Well, don't stop now.

37:28.107 --> 37:29.907
You're on a roll.

37:33.812 --> 37:36.781
So, what, you spent your whole life

37:36.782 --> 37:40.251
Trying to drag these kids
up out of the mud, right?

37:40.252 --> 37:41.519
And what do you get in return?

37:41.520 --> 37:42.654
You get nothing.

37:42.655 --> 37:45.857
I mean, that's how you
really feel, isn't it?

37:45.858 --> 37:47.191
So now it's your turn.

37:47.192 --> 37:49.093
Is that right?

37:49.094 --> 37:51.129
How much money were you
gonna have to steal

37:51.130 --> 37:54.866
Before you could walk
away from these kids, eh?

37:54.867 --> 37:56.834
500 grand?

37:56.835 --> 37:58.469
A million?

37:58.470 --> 38:00.572
2 million?

38:00.573 --> 38:01.839
Oh, 2.

38:01.840 --> 38:02.974
Ambitious lady.

38:02.975 --> 38:04.475
And once a man was
killed during a robbery,

38:04.476 --> 38:06.778
You had no choice, right?

38:06.779 --> 38:09.013
Marly showed you the egg,
threatened to expose you.

38:09.014 --> 38:10.815
You had to kill her.

38:10.816 --> 38:13.184
You can't prove any of this.

38:13.185 --> 38:15.086
You admitted to knowing
about the robberies.

38:15.087 --> 38:16.187
You signed the releases.

38:16.188 --> 38:19.223
And we have your bank records.

38:19.224 --> 38:22.360
Dax made me do all of it.

38:24.697 --> 38:26.364
Murderer!

38:26.365 --> 38:28.366
Shut up!

38:28.367 --> 38:29.934
Quiet!

38:29.935 --> 38:33.404
It's my word against dax's.

38:33.405 --> 38:38.276
A juvenile delinquent,
a thief, a murderer.

38:38.277 --> 38:39.744
Who's a jury gonna believe?

38:39.745 --> 38:41.979
Tell her.

38:42.581 --> 38:43.748
Every lie you told

38:43.749 --> 38:45.516
Since you walked into
this room we have on tape.

38:45.517 --> 38:48.119
We will walk a jury
through every microsecond

38:48.120 --> 38:49.854
Of every single one.

38:49.855 --> 38:53.958
It is not your word
against dax's anymore.

38:53.959 --> 38:57.228
No, it's your word against mine.

38:57.229 --> 38:58.763
You lose.

39:08.874 --> 39:11.442
Put your hands behind your back.

39:13.312 --> 39:15.947
You're under arrest.

39:15.948 --> 39:19.350
The kids needed to see this.

39:19.351 --> 39:21.819
It's therapy.

39:21.820 --> 39:23.821
Unconventional therapy.

39:23.822 --> 39:25.056
Absolutely.

39:25.057 --> 39:27.191
Whoo!

39:27.192 --> 39:30.227
Let's go.

39:40.673 --> 39:43.608
Hey.

39:43.609 --> 39:47.478
So foster's got a friend who runs an
alternative boarding school in richmond.

39:47.479 --> 39:49.414
And he said he'd take her.

39:49.415 --> 39:51.149
She's staying with me.

39:51.150 --> 39:54.385
I'm petitioning for custody.

39:54.386 --> 39:55.953
Well, once again you're fired.

39:55.954 --> 39:58.656
You can't just always threaten
to fire people all the time.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.024
Yeah, I can, actually.

40:00.025 --> 40:02.126
Yeah, especially when they
prove to be complete idiots.

40:02.127 --> 40:03.695
You don't get it.
I promised her, all right?

40:03.696 --> 40:05.630
When I was in high school,
I promised her

40:05.631 --> 40:07.565
That whenever I could,
I would come back and I'd get her

40:07.566 --> 40:10.301
And we'd live together.
Our dad wouldn't even be able to find us.

40:10.302 --> 40:11.369
We'd be free.

40:11.370 --> 40:12.370
Of what?

40:12.371 --> 40:14.706
Everything.

40:14.707 --> 40:17.141
Our dad, mostly.

40:17.142 --> 40:18.176
Sounds peachy.

40:18.177 --> 40:19.911
Yeah, but I didn't go back.

40:19.912 --> 40:23.548
I just... I just left her there.

40:23.549 --> 40:26.417
I broke my promise.

40:28.220 --> 40:31.288
She needs help, love.

40:32.291 --> 40:35.126
She needs to want help.

40:35.127 --> 40:38.196
You got to let her
find her own way.

40:38.197 --> 40:41.432
Best part of being a parent.

40:41.433 --> 40:44.402
Unfortunately.

41:04.523 --> 41:08.192
* you can find me in
a field of ferns *

41:08.193 --> 41:11.362
* pressing my head
against shaded earth *

41:11.363 --> 41:14.732
* with my ears open wide *

41:14.733 --> 41:19.170
* I can listen all night *

41:20.706 --> 41:24.375
* I am reaching *

41:24.376 --> 41:28.312

I will.

41:45.898 --> 41:49.467
I should have been there more.

41:49.468 --> 41:51.736

41:51.737 --> 41:55.172
Oh, stop. I can't cry my first day.

42:10.756 --> 42:12.557
All right, go get smart.

42:12.558 --> 42:14.325
I'm already smart, bitch.

42:14.326 --> 42:15.359
Hey. Watch your mouth.

42:15.360 --> 42:17.461
You're not my mom.

42:17.462 --> 42:19.363
No, I'm not.

42:19.364 --> 42:21.866
But I love you.

42:22.768 --> 42:24.535
I love you.

So, can I drive home?

43:15.153 --> 43:16.621

43:16.622 --> 43:18.022
You're not driving again.
