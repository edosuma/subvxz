00:23.440 --> 00:26.079
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.679
Two things I'm looking forward
to in tonight's show.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.479
First, we are testing a
real smorgasbord of cars.

00:32.479 --> 00:36.559
We've got supercars,
grand tourers and hot hatches.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.960
Second, I got to say smorgasbord.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.399
Smorgasbord.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.999
I love saying smorgasbord.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.999
OK, now, as anyone who
has a couple of kids knows,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.119
the worst thing you can do
is buy them one toy

00:49.120 --> 00:51.519
and tell them to share it.
Never ends well.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.439
So the producers thought
it'd be funny to see

00:53.440 --> 00:55.479
if the same is true for presenters.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.839
So they told Chris and I
to both go and review

00:57.840 --> 01:01.920
the latest 200mph British
grand tourer in sunny Spain.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.719
This is Spain?

01:14.720 --> 01:16.719
I thought Spain was
supposed to be warm.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.479
This is the Sierra Nevada, Matthew.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.599
The highest road in Europe,

01:20.600 --> 01:22.960
therefore it gets a bit
nippy up here.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.640
Ooh, look.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.239
That is...

01:30.240 --> 01:32.240
..stunning. Look at that.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.840
Welcome to the new
Bentley Continental GT.

01:39.680 --> 01:44.199
Â£150,000 of tailored British luxury,

01:44.200 --> 01:49.919
which Bentley claims is the finest
grand tourer ever produced.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.759
- It's beautiful. - Yeah.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.999
You know, if there was one of those
at the top of every mountain,

01:55.000 --> 01:58.519
- I would definitely climb more
mountains. - Yeah, absolutely.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.199
So I guess all we have to do now
is decide who's driving first.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.160
So we should probably just...

02:04.240 --> 02:07.000
No, no, no, off you go.
There you go, there you go.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.038
- You missed. - Such a bellend.

02:11.039 --> 02:14.800
- He always gets his own way.
- That's nice.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.839
What are you doing?

02:18.840 --> 02:21.920
- It's quite slippery,
you might have noticed. - Get in.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.679
Don't feel bad.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.439
Look, you're just smaller
and weaker.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.999
- I very nearly had you there,
you know that. - Please.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.959
I was checking my phone
with the other hand.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.559
Whatever. Just be really,
really careful.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.399
I'm a terrible passenger.
This just looks dangerous to me.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.879
Stop being so panicky.
We've got four-wheel drive.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.079
Four-wheel drive when
you're going slowly.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.719
The faster you go, this thing
becomes two-wheel drive,

02:52.720 --> 02:54.999
- rear-wheel drive. - Really? - Yes.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.960
So the faster you go,
the more dangerous it gets?

03:06.440 --> 03:07.919
This feels very safe.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.280
Stop cocking about.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.560
Ho-ho!

03:19.320 --> 03:20.760
Stop right here.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.159
Well, I think I speak
for myself when I say

03:26.160 --> 03:29.639
that I'm glad that's over.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.479
OK, first impressions?

03:31.480 --> 03:34.840
Bentley's new grand tourer
is definitely cut out for winter.

03:36.440 --> 03:40.280
But now, on proper tarmac,
the real road test could begin.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.440
- Hey, can you move your seat
back a little bit? - Yeah, sure.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.599
Bit more.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.039
- A bit more. Yeah, tilt it
right back. - Why?

03:52.040 --> 03:54.600
Well, I've just got a little
business to take care of.

03:56.080 --> 04:01.479
So, the Bentley Continental GT
first arrived back in 2003.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.599
This is now the third generation
of the car.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.319
What are you doing?

04:05.320 --> 04:08.479
- I'm reviewing the car. - What?
- They told us to review the car.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.599
They told US to review the car,
not you to review the car.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.679
Well, we can't both review the car.
It's not a duet.

04:14.680 --> 04:17.478
Just stay back there.
No-one will even know you're here.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.639
- This is just demeaning.
- It's not demeaning.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.759
Hey, you got anything
you could pop on your head?

04:22.760 --> 04:25.039
We're getting a little bit
of a glare off your dome.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.400
Are you for real?

04:27.880 --> 04:31.959
The Bentley Continental GT
first arrived back in 2003.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.599
This is the third generation
of the car.

04:34.600 --> 04:39.119
This is a car for people who want
to drive very far, very fast...

04:39.120 --> 04:40.919
You said "car" twice
in that sentence.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.919
And I think the audience
knows it's a car.

04:42.920 --> 04:46.039
It's got four wheels,
it's sort of car-shaped.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.440
Are you done?

04:49.880 --> 04:51.359
This...

04:51.360 --> 04:53.000
I can touch your nose, look.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.120
This was going to be a long trip.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.439
Now, as I was saying,

05:05.440 --> 05:11.239
this is the Bentley Continental GT,
which first arrived back in 2003.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.159
But this is the third generation
of the car,

05:14.160 --> 05:17.679
and it is by far the best one yet,

05:17.680 --> 05:21.200
because it's lighter, faster and
more comfortable than ever before.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.199
It's got 626 horsepower.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.560
It'll do 0 to 60 in 3.7 seconds...

05:31.120 --> 05:35.799
..and it won't top out
until 207mph.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.000
This...

05:38.600 --> 05:41.359
So close! It was so close.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.559
- I knew you were going to interrupt
me. - It was so close.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.079
- I knew you were going
to interrupt me. -!

05:46.080 --> 05:49.079
Really, there is no more
soothing way

05:49.080 --> 05:51.319
to rack up a massive speeding fine.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.719
- Don't forget the armrests. - Why?
- The armrests.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.879
- Why? - I'll show you.
Just pull over and stop.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.120
- But I only just got started.
- Just stop!

06:02.600 --> 06:05.120
- Where you going?
- I'll be back in a minute.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.599
Where is he going?

06:12.440 --> 06:14.639
He's a funny little fella, isn't he?

06:14.640 --> 06:16.639
OK, so...

06:16.640 --> 06:18.839
- What is that? - It's a cup of coffee.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.599
Where did you get that?

06:20.600 --> 06:23.599
- So, you've just bought your new
Bentley Continental GT. -

06:23.600 --> 06:25.999
- Over 150 grand of your hard-earned.
- Yeah.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.439
You get into it to go to work,

06:27.440 --> 06:29.559
- you want to have a coffee
in the morning. - Yeah.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.439
So you put your coffee in there,
and you think,

06:31.440 --> 06:35.079
"I'll just adjust the armrest
so it's nice and comfy."

06:35.080 --> 06:37.439
Move that forwards now.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.959
- What, the armrest? - Yeah.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.119
Well... I see.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.159
Yeah. Well, you can't.
The coffee's in the way.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.399
Yeah, I know.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.799
That's a really, really poor piece
of ergonomic design.

06:47.800 --> 06:52.040
OK, that is the first-est
of first-world problems.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.039
I'm looking out for
the normal consumer,

06:57.040 --> 06:59.119
who can afford to buy...

06:59.120 --> 07:00.599
I will give you that. OK.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.239
I will give you that,
that that is a design flaw.

07:03.240 --> 07:08.039
- However... - ..how can you
not love a cabin that does this?

07:08.040 --> 07:09.360
Are you ready?

07:11.720 --> 07:13.879
- - OK. - Come on.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.239
- OK. - Come on. That is great.

07:16.240 --> 07:20.520
That is the future that we were
promised back in the '70s.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.880
- That is beautiful. - That is awesome!

07:26.240 --> 07:28.799
Yep, irritating cup-holder aside,

07:28.800 --> 07:32.039
wafting through southern Spain
in style and comfort,

07:32.040 --> 07:35.359
the Continental was quickly
proving the ideal tool

07:35.360 --> 07:37.679
for eating up the miles.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.279
In fact, the only thing
it was missing

07:40.280 --> 07:43.239
was an off switch for my companion.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.680
Ooh, press pack.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.599
Get this.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.999
"Diamond knurling aids
a luxurious touch

07:50.000 --> 07:52.679
"using a three-dimensional
faceted surface."

07:52.680 --> 07:54.679
I love a bit of knurling.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.879
- You love knurling as well,
don't you? -

07:57.880 --> 08:01.079
Frankly, knurling was
the last thing on my mind.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.319
My back teeth were floating.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.839
- What's wrong? - I just, er...

08:06.840 --> 08:09.079
I really have to use the gents.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.079
Well, just pull over here
and use the gents.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.599
I also really don't
want you to drive,

08:13.600 --> 08:16.399
- so I'm very conflicted. - OK.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.520
Well...

08:23.160 --> 08:25.079
- Funny. - Drinky?

08:25.080 --> 08:26.399
No, thanks.

08:29.080 --> 08:32.919
If you pull over,
I can guarantee one thing.

08:32.919 --> 08:35.438
- What? - I will definitely steal
your driving seat.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.558
You're like a horrible rash,
do you know that?

08:38.559 --> 08:40.759
That's been said before.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.599
Luckily, I'm a horrible rash

08:42.600 --> 08:46.039
who happens to be equipped with the
bladder of a camel.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.920
You're not going to win this.

08:52.120 --> 08:54.679
It's by a band called Running Water.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.640
A slash, a winkle...

09:01.960 --> 09:04.120
..a wazzle, a wee.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.720
A widdle, a pee.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.959
I can't take it any more.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.560
I can't, I can't. I've got to go.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
- That bush has got your name
written all over it. -...

09:24.000 --> 09:25.759
Let him step away.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.159
- I'm just going to check
the rear tyres. - No!

09:28.160 --> 09:30.439
- Just going to check the rear tyres.
- No!

09:30.440 --> 09:32.359
Just check this one.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.799
Yeah, they're pretty good,
those rear tyres.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.239
Look at this.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.079
This is more like it.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.120
Right.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.240
Right, my turn to review.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.559
Now with a proper driver
at the wheel,

09:53.560 --> 09:56.479
it was time to get stuck into
what this new Bentley

09:56.480 --> 09:58.560
is really all about.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.199
OK, let's talk about the engine.

10:04.200 --> 10:08.120
Like the old Continental,
this car has a W12.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.279
This time round,
it has dual injection,

10:14.280 --> 10:16.399
so it means it has regular
port injection

10:16.400 --> 10:18.439
and it also has direct injection.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.039
Jewel? Jewel with a J?

10:21.040 --> 10:24.159
- Jewel? - It has two forms
of injection.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.319
- DUAL. - OK. - Dual. I got you.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.440
Go ahead.

10:30.880 --> 10:35.599
Now, unlike a Ferrari V12,
which is all revvy and racy,

10:35.600 --> 10:37.559
the W12 is more relaxed.

10:37.560 --> 10:41.800
It provides effortless performance,
which is perfect for a Bentley.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.599
You didn't mention
the cylinder shutdown.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.599
I was about to mention
the cylinder shutdown.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.559
I would've put it first,
but that's just me.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.960
Featuring cylinder shutdown.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.759
Basically, it shuts down half
the cylinders

10:58.760 --> 11:01.119
when it doesn't need them.
Doesn't matter.

11:01.120 --> 11:06.719
What does matter is how much better
this new Continental is to drive.

11:06.720 --> 11:10.039
- What are you doing?
- Time for a little detour.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.879
No-one who drives this car
will ever do this.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.040
Well, I'm driving this car
and I'm doing this.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.679
Now, how different is it
to the old Continental?

11:21.680 --> 11:24.359
The old Continental
had a fixed torque split,

11:24.360 --> 11:26.759
40% to the front, 60% to the rear.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.359
This has a kind of constantly
variable torque split,

11:29.360 --> 11:32.319
- because it has this new
electronic brain. - Torque split.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.279
That is some sexy road-test speak
right there.

11:35.280 --> 11:36.559
Hey, if we're lucky,

11:36.560 --> 11:39.040
we might get a little bit
of "through the wrists".

11:41.680 --> 11:42.959
What else have we got?

11:42.960 --> 11:45.759
Air suspension -
even on this rocky surface,

11:45.760 --> 11:47.599
the ride is so level,

11:47.600 --> 11:51.599
that means you can genuinely feel
this car through the wrists.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.479
That's it! That is the stuff.

11:54.480 --> 11:59.359
This is like a Chris Harris
Greatest Hits album. This is great!

11:59.360 --> 12:01.039
Sideways on gravel in a Bentley.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.359
This is fantastic.

12:02.360 --> 12:06.679
- Can you feel that body control?
- Body control!

12:06.680 --> 12:08.999
Woohoo!

12:09.000 --> 12:11.719
What I'm doing, Matthew,
even though you laugh,

12:11.720 --> 12:14.759
is I'm telling people what they
want to hear about the car.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.119
I'm educating them.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.479
What you're doing is you're telling
one guy from Ipswich

12:18.480 --> 12:20.439
what he wants to hear about the car.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.839
Now, come on, pull over.
It's my turn to drive.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.119
Over my dead body.
You've had your turn, OK?

12:25.120 --> 12:27.800
I am driving for the rest
of this trip, and you know it.

12:36.040 --> 12:40.279
Sorry to have to do that,
but you left me no choice.

12:40.280 --> 12:45.120
See, this is what people who buy
this car are going to do.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.600
Cover miles on the open road.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.599
This new air suspension,

12:55.600 --> 13:00.839
you put it in comfort and you could
almost forget you're driving it.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.399
How's the back seat?

13:02.400 --> 13:05.559
What's the point in boasting
about having a W12 engine

13:05.560 --> 13:08.559
that's 24% shorter than a V12,

13:08.560 --> 13:11.239
if a small man can't sit
in the back of it?

13:11.240 --> 13:13.919
Sub-eight-year-olds
will be fine back here.

13:13.920 --> 13:18.399
- And, critically, I can
administer a wet willy. -!

13:18.400 --> 13:22.719
So this is literally like having
a child test the rear seat.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.519
You're a filthy,
disgusting eight-year-old.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.719
You smell horrible.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.240
I mean, absolutely horrible.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.359
Where are we going?

13:40.360 --> 13:44.599
We were going to the
Continental's spiritual home...

13:44.600 --> 13:48.480
..because people who drive Bentleys
love to eat out.

13:53.640 --> 13:56.239
It does look way better
than before, doesn't it?

13:56.240 --> 13:58.919
- It does, but I've got
a problem with this. - What?

13:58.920 --> 14:01.319
- The people who drive them. - Hold on.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.999
You can't blame the car
for the people who drive it.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.799
You know, that's like saying, er,

14:06.800 --> 14:09.599
those kids that wear their pants
below their ass?

14:09.600 --> 14:11.279
It's not the pants' fault.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.559
They're long enough,
they're just being worn wrong.

14:13.560 --> 14:14.879
You know what I think?

14:14.880 --> 14:17.759
I think this is the best
Bentley they've ever made.

14:17.760 --> 14:20.239
That's a bold statement.
They've made some good Bentleys.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.679
OK, the Bentayga?

14:21.680 --> 14:24.599
- Uglier, not as fun to drive.
- That's true.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.199
The Mulsanne is slower.
So this is it.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.719
If you want to do big miles,
you want to do them really fast,

14:30.720 --> 14:33.239
this is the best Bentley ever made.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.719
You do give some great summary,
I'll give you that.

14:35.720 --> 14:39.079
- Thank you. - Lovely work.
- Thank you. - I'm driving.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.799
- But I haven't finished eating.
- Yeah, well, I've had an idea.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.520
Come on. Come on!

14:46.360 --> 14:48.519
Because if this Bentley
really is the best car

14:48.520 --> 14:51.879
they've ever made for
doing big miles fast,

14:51.880 --> 14:56.399
there was one more place
we needed to test it.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.079
Ascari - the longest
racetrack in Spain,

14:59.080 --> 15:02.400
and the perfect place to stretch
the Bentley's legs.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.959
OK, let me guess.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.239
You want me to sit here in the
passenger seat like a lemon

15:08.240 --> 15:11.439
- while you slide this thing
around the track. - You're driving.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.759
- Really? - Yeah.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.239
- What's the catch? - Nothing.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.719
- And what are you going to do?
- I'll find something to do.

15:17.720 --> 15:20.720
Don't worry about that.
Genuinely. All yours. Enjoy.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.759
You know, that's the thing
about Harris.

15:36.760 --> 15:40.439
He can spend ages being
a total pain in the ass,

15:40.440 --> 15:45.919
but when it comes right down to it,
he's really a good guy.

15:45.920 --> 15:50.120
And the Continental GT
really is a blast.

15:53.280 --> 15:56.399
Now, you don't think
of Bentleys as track cars,

15:56.400 --> 16:00.479
and in sport mode,
it really hides its weight.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.920
Surprisingly nimble.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.799
Quick, too.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.559
But then let's not forget

16:06.560 --> 16:10.360
the whole history of Bentley
is intertwined with racing.

16:12.160 --> 16:16.079
Back in the 1920s,
Bentley dominated Le Mans.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.439
The racetrack is in its blood.

16:18.440 --> 16:21.719
Yes. Yes, it is.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.640
Whoa! What the hell is that?!

16:30.200 --> 16:33.919
You know how you said
that was the best Bentley

16:33.920 --> 16:36.279
for covering distance fast?

16:36.280 --> 16:39.039
Matt, you're wrong,

16:39.040 --> 16:43.119
because this is the best
Bentley for going fast,

16:43.120 --> 16:44.800
the Speed 8.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.960
In 2003, Bentley won
the Le Mans 24 hours...

16:52.360 --> 16:56.600
..covering over
3,000 miles in one day.

16:58.520 --> 17:02.319
So for covering big distances fast,
this,

17:02.320 --> 17:04.119
this is the ultimate Bentley.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.119
OK, hotshot. How about a race,
then?

17:14.440 --> 17:16.598
One lap of the track.

17:16.599 --> 17:20.079
Me in this, against you in that.

17:20.079 --> 17:23.159
I'm sorry, you in your road car,

17:23.160 --> 17:26.598
you want to take on this
pedigree racing machine?

17:26.599 --> 17:28.079
Only one rule.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.799
That's a Le Mans car, right?

17:29.800 --> 17:32.199
So we do a Le Mans start.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.600
Bring it on!

17:34.960 --> 17:38.160
- Three... - Yeah. - ..two, one. Go!

17:41.440 --> 17:43.440
You move really well
for an older guy.

17:45.840 --> 17:49.120
Easy. Jump in, click, go.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.320
Ho-ho! OK.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.560
He's probably still getting
his fat butt in the thing.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.560
Come on!

18:06.920 --> 18:08.999
Apex here. Come on,
get in there, baby.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.479
Bite, bite, bite.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.839
The GT was building a lead.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.839
But all too soon...

18:16.840 --> 18:19.959
..the Speed 8 was in the chase.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.439
Come on, Le Mans.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.319
We're going to catch him!

18:23.320 --> 18:25.400
Chris was only 18 seconds behind.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.720
Come on, baby. Go, go, go.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.919
I do love a racing car.

18:32.920 --> 18:37.079
It goes 97mph in first gear.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.679
600 horsepower.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.559
I can handle a bit of this.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.480
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?

18:46.360 --> 18:47.960
Come on, Le Mans-winning Bentley.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.440
Over halfway through the lap,
the GT was flying.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.040
But the Speed 8 was reeling us in.

18:57.080 --> 19:00.359
Shoot, there he is.
Go, go, go, go, go.

19:00.360 --> 19:01.840
Where is he? There he is!

19:03.920 --> 19:06.280
Come on, LeBlanc. You can do this.
You can do it!

19:07.880 --> 19:11.159
But with Chris pushing harder
and harder to catch us...

19:11.160 --> 19:12.679
Right there. Jeez.

19:12.680 --> 19:17.239
..the damp track was giving
the Speed 8 trouble.

19:17.240 --> 19:21.719
These tyres are so cold,
I've got no traction at all.

19:21.720 --> 19:22.959
Bloody terrifying!

19:22.960 --> 19:24.640
All right, come on, come on.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.199
Whoa!

19:29.200 --> 19:30.960
No way I'm going to catch him.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.160
We got this.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.240
Woohoo!

19:39.960 --> 19:43.600
Now, I think - I think -
they call that a win.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.239
Fair play.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.320
He and that new car were too quick.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.319
The Continental GT,

19:51.320 --> 19:54.999
the best Bentley...

19:55.000 --> 19:57.440
..ever.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.199
Come on.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.639
Good car.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.919
Yeah, that was a great trip.

20:09.920 --> 20:13.679
This new Bentley,
this is seriously one fast car.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.319
I mean, faster than
the Le Mans-winning Bentley.

20:16.320 --> 20:19.399
- Well, not exactly. - Really? - Yeah.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.039
I definitely remember seeing you
in the rear-view mirror,

20:22.040 --> 20:24.159
- not out the front.
- We've been through this, OK?

20:24.160 --> 20:26.799
Slick tyres, wet track,
the track temperature

20:26.800 --> 20:30.879
- was just above freezing - impossible
to get any heat into them. -

20:30.880 --> 20:33.119
And secondly, the Le Mans start.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.799
Cost me 18 seconds
doing the harness up,

20:35.800 --> 20:39.159
and even then, a couple more
corners, I'd have had you.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.439
Yeah. yeah, I have to say,
you were wringing that thing's neck,

20:42.440 --> 20:44.599
- seriously, great driving.
- Thank you.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.199
Yeah, if only we could teach you
to do up your seat belt,

20:47.200 --> 20:48.759
you would be the total package.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.399
Rory?

20:50.400 --> 20:52.839
OK, let's talk hot hatches,

20:52.840 --> 20:55.439
because things are
kicking off right now.

20:55.440 --> 21:00.039
Mercedes A45, Ford Focus RS,
Honda Civic Type R -

21:00.040 --> 21:01.679
serious machines.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.839
And now it's the turn of Renault

21:03.840 --> 21:06.599
to unleash their
new big-dog hot hatch.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.319
And that is a big deal,

21:08.320 --> 21:11.520
because Renault,
well, they've got form.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.800
Yes. Renault's hot hatchback
catalogue...

21:20.640 --> 21:22.080
..is tidy.

21:23.160 --> 21:27.839
For starters, there's this -
the Renault 5 Turbo.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.439
Genuine legend, this thing.

21:29.440 --> 21:33.199
Based on a Group B rally car,
engine in the middle,

21:33.200 --> 21:34.480
properly lairy.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.559
This is an old-school turbo. Ha-ha!

21:38.560 --> 21:42.040
You never know when it's going
to come on song and spit you out.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.440
Then they did the Clio Williams.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.040
Yep, as in Williams, the F1 team.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.320
Gold wheels, gold-star hot hatch.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.600
And this is the Clio V6...

21:58.800 --> 22:00.960
..another mid-engine monster.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.480
Lethal in the wet.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.880
There are more of these in hedges
than there are on driveways.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.039
Love it!

22:11.040 --> 22:15.799
And of course there is
the legendary Megane R26.R.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.399
Bendy windows, race harnesses,

22:18.400 --> 22:20.839
lapped the Nurburgring faster than

22:20.840 --> 22:23.599
any front-wheel-drive road car
before it.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.880
That is quite a bloodline.

22:27.640 --> 22:30.599
When it comes to properly exciting
hot hatches,

22:30.600 --> 22:31.959
Renault wrote the book,

22:31.960 --> 22:36.319
so their latest chapter
is going to be pretty special.

22:36.320 --> 22:37.760
Isn't it?

22:39.520 --> 22:41.759
Um, well...

22:41.760 --> 22:46.679
Not really, because it's all a
bit sort of nothingy, isn't it?

22:46.680 --> 22:48.879
I mean, where are the wings?

22:48.880 --> 22:50.760
Where are the pointy bits?

22:51.920 --> 22:55.719
This is supposed to be
Renault's hottest hatch ever,

22:55.720 --> 23:00.080
and yet it kind of looks like
it was designed by a grown-up.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.879
And that's a worry,
because to do battle

23:03.880 --> 23:07.959
with all the crazy performance
hot hatches flying around today,

23:07.960 --> 23:11.440
Renault needs a comic book superhero
of a car.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.320
And then you get going.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.359
And while its 1.8-litre
four-cylinder turbo

23:23.360 --> 23:26.759
is Renault's most
powerful engine yet,

23:26.760 --> 23:30.040
it only makes 277 horsepower.

23:31.320 --> 23:35.359
That's 40 less than
a Honda Civic Type R.

23:35.360 --> 23:38.559
The Mercedes A45 makes 100 more.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.000
100!

23:44.360 --> 23:46.959
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not saying that it's slow -

23:46.960 --> 23:49.120
it'll do 0 to 60
in under six seconds.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.359
But the fastest hot hatches
out there nowadays,

23:53.360 --> 23:55.400
they'll do it in under five.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.879
Same story in here, really.

23:57.880 --> 24:00.559
The steering wheel, that's nice,
leather, Alcantara,

24:00.560 --> 24:03.439
little red line, decent.
But where's my drift mode?

24:03.440 --> 24:06.239
Where's my fancy four-wheel-drive
system?

24:06.240 --> 24:10.279
Renault knows how to make
a mind-blowing hot hatch,

24:10.280 --> 24:14.559
so how have they fallen
so far behind with the new Megane?

24:14.560 --> 24:16.720
Well, they didn't.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.719
Because the thing with this car is,

24:25.720 --> 24:28.599
the old Renault DNA is still there,

24:28.600 --> 24:31.679
it's just below the surface,
because it's...

24:31.680 --> 24:33.479
It's DNA.

24:33.480 --> 24:39.320
And the first win for the Renault
gene pool is the steering.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.079
Normally that's a job
for the front wheels,

24:43.080 --> 24:45.719
but here, the rear wheels
do it too.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.960
Not by much, but they do steer.

24:49.360 --> 24:53.799
At low speeds, they can angle 2.7
degrees in the opposite direction

24:53.800 --> 24:57.519
to the front wheels,
to make you turn sharper.

24:57.520 --> 25:01.439
And when you go in a bit quicker,
they can angle by one degree

25:01.440 --> 25:04.519
in the same direction as the fronts,
to help stability.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.479
One degree.

25:06.480 --> 25:13.120
Yes, that may be a small amount,
but it makes... a big difference.

25:16.560 --> 25:19.720
It's so agile,
it's so quick on the turning.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.999
It might look placid, this car,
but you know what?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.279
It's got bite.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.920
Like a badger.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.120
What doesn't bite is the
suspension...

25:36.280 --> 25:38.639
..which uses hydraulic bump stops,

25:38.640 --> 25:40.999
borrowed from the world of rallying.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.519
In technical terms,
it's kind of a damper

25:43.520 --> 25:44.999
inside a damper.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.719
In nontechnical terms, well,

25:46.720 --> 25:49.720
it means you can wang along
a bumpy road like this...

25:56.880 --> 25:58.399
Ha-ha!

25:58.400 --> 26:01.400
..without the front suspension
smashing through the bodywork.

26:05.200 --> 26:06.560
How smooth was that?

26:09.240 --> 26:12.919
Honestly, if I was in a Ford Focus
RS, I would have no teeth by now.

26:12.920 --> 26:17.919
What we have here is a serious,
clever little hot hatch.

26:17.920 --> 26:23.160
And the deeper you delve into it,
the more cleverness you will find.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.000
Take that rear diffuser.

26:27.480 --> 26:30.879
The reason the car doesn't have
massive wings on the outside

26:30.880 --> 26:34.559
is because it generates
enough downforce on its own,

26:34.560 --> 26:39.479
while the engine takes expertise
from Renault's Formula 1 squad.

26:39.480 --> 26:42.239
Cylinder linings are polished
to a mirror finish

26:42.240 --> 26:43.600
and then sprayed...

26:44.560 --> 26:45.600
..with plasma.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.479
I don't know why,
or what that achieves,

26:50.480 --> 26:52.960
but, you know, plasma!

26:55.280 --> 26:58.599
And get this - sensors
all around the car

26:58.600 --> 27:01.959
can tell you about steering angle
and G-force and stuff.

27:01.960 --> 27:04.239
But the coolest bit
is that you'll be able

27:04.240 --> 27:06.959
to hook your phone up,
record your driving,

27:06.960 --> 27:10.079
and the car will add
all that data as graphics,

27:10.080 --> 27:13.600
so it looks like you're in
some sort of live video game.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.239
Social media are going to love that.

27:17.240 --> 27:21.280
As will the accident
investigating officer.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.959
So the Megane RS is a car
for the driver

27:26.960 --> 27:29.360
who really cares about driving.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.880
And who really cares
about value for money.

27:35.600 --> 27:39.399
It costs 28 grand,
which is actually pretty reasonable

27:39.400 --> 27:41.079
by hot hatch standards.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.959
And let's be honest,
it's not really 28 grand, is it?

27:43.960 --> 27:47.519
Because if you buy it on finance,
which nearly everyone will,

27:47.520 --> 27:50.439
then it's going to be
more like Â£300 a month,

27:50.440 --> 27:52.160
which sounds a whole lot better.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.440
Point is, the Megane
is a smart choice.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.319
Sure, it might look a little plain

28:06.320 --> 28:10.079
alongside Renault's bag-of-frogs
back catalogue,

28:10.080 --> 28:13.000
but this is a different sort of
hot hatch.

28:17.720 --> 28:22.079
This is a hot hatch for the guy
who loved lairy hot hatches

28:22.080 --> 28:25.879
in the '90s, but who's grown up,
had kids

28:25.880 --> 28:28.759
and needs something
a bit more practical.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.640
This is a hot hatch for...

28:32.160 --> 28:33.440
..me.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.400
Which means I should love this car.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.560
But I just don't quite.

28:44.960 --> 28:48.039
This is a good car,
a really good car.

28:48.040 --> 28:51.360
But for a hot hatch,
it's just a bit... grown-up.

28:55.480 --> 28:58.359
Thankfully, I have the answer.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.120
Jump Around by House of Pain

29:05.360 --> 29:10.079
Check it out - Reid's patented
adaptable body kit.

29:10.080 --> 29:14.239
Environmentally friendly,
fits almost any car.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.520
Now it's a proper hot hatch.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.480
- Slow clap. - Slow clap, no...

29:29.560 --> 29:32.759
The old cardboard spoiler, mate,
not one of your best ideas.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.639
I don't know!
I think it looked fantastic.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.079
You know, while it stayed on.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.639
- You agree? - No.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.719
But the Megane, OK,
what you're saying is,

29:39.720 --> 29:42.759
you don't like it because it's too
well-suited to your lifestyle?!

29:42.760 --> 29:43.959
Well, exactly.

29:43.960 --> 29:47.079
I can think of loads of things
that are a good idea,

29:47.080 --> 29:50.479
like, I don't know, a pension
or going to the dentist

29:50.480 --> 29:52.399
or kale smoothies.

29:52.400 --> 29:55.519
OK? Good ideas
aren't always fun.

29:55.520 --> 29:59.840
What's not fun about
a competently engineered hot hatch?

30:00.960 --> 30:02.199
When you buy a hot hatch,

30:02.200 --> 30:04.399
you buy it because you want to
show off a bit.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.319
These guys will back
me up on this, OK?

30:06.320 --> 30:10.159
And who wants to go to the pub
to discuss hydraulic bump stops?

30:10.160 --> 30:12.479
Me.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.359
And that is why

30:14.360 --> 30:16.399
we don't invite you to the pub.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.159
Look, what I'm saying is,

30:18.160 --> 30:21.639
I don't want a car that reminds me
that I'm not 21 any more.

30:21.640 --> 30:24.399
You're not even 31, Rory,
you're nearly 40.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.559
And is there anything
about my outfit

30:27.560 --> 30:29.199
that suggests I've embraced that?

30:29.200 --> 30:30.999
That's a good point, Zippy.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.439
Matt.

30:32.440 --> 30:36.279
OK, now it's time to put a star
in our reasonably fast car.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.039
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the sofa

30:39.040 --> 30:42.439
the multi-Grammy-winning
Gregory Porter!

30:45.960 --> 30:48.799
How are you doing?
How are you, buddy?

30:48.800 --> 30:50.920
- Good to see you. - Hello.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.640
- All right, take a seat.
- All right.

30:59.440 --> 31:02.319
All right, well...
Welcome to Britain,

31:02.320 --> 31:05.119
though you're pretty much
an honorary Brit, right?

31:05.120 --> 31:06.479
Yeah, I'm here all the time.

31:06.480 --> 31:09.159
Yeah, you played for
the Prime Minister, the Queen.

31:09.160 --> 31:12.439
Yeah, both of those
very fine ladies, yes.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.599
Yeah, OK, so tell me,
who was a better audience?

31:14.600 --> 31:16.999
Um, the Queen is pretty...
That's pretty dope.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.479
I mean, that's pretty amazing,
you know? Yeah, you know...

31:20.480 --> 31:23.239
- How often's the... - She did the...

31:23.240 --> 31:25.760
How often's the Queen referred to
as dope?

31:27.320 --> 31:30.279
You spend a lot of time over here.
Do you do much driving over here?

31:30.280 --> 31:34.999
I did drive for about an hour
in central London and I got about...

31:35.000 --> 31:36.559
I got about three blocks

31:36.560 --> 31:39.799
before I said, you know,
"I'm through with this."

31:39.800 --> 31:42.079
But didn't you... You lived
in New York for a long time.

31:42.080 --> 31:44.159
I lived in New York
for 13 years, but...

31:44.160 --> 31:46.319
Isn't that worse than driving here?

31:46.320 --> 31:48.799
It is, especially in Brooklyn.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.799
Because there are...
There's traffic rules

31:51.800 --> 31:53.439
and then there's Brooklyn rules.
OK.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.039
You know, Brooklyn rules is like,

31:55.040 --> 31:57.519
you have to take off
BEFORE it turns green,

31:57.520 --> 32:00.919
and if you don't, you will get
yelled and cussed at.

32:00.920 --> 32:03.759
And cars have the right of way,
you know, they...

32:03.760 --> 32:05.359
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

32:05.360 --> 32:08.639
If you're walking across the street,
you're fair game.

32:08.640 --> 32:09.959
That's true, yeah.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.599
So be careful in Brooklyn.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.319
So we had Professor Green on
not too long ago,

32:14.320 --> 32:16.759
and he said he writes
a lot of his songs

32:16.760 --> 32:19.519
while he's in the car.
Do you do that, too?

32:19.520 --> 32:23.039
I've written many of my songs
while I'm driving.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.879
And it's something about the motion,

32:25.880 --> 32:28.839
something about seeing people
pass me by,

32:28.840 --> 32:31.959
and I don't know their story,
but I'll give them a story.

32:31.960 --> 32:35.319
Like, I pass by a couple,
a man and a woman,

32:35.320 --> 32:37.199
they may be in an argument,
and I was like,

32:37.200 --> 32:40.679
"This is our last moment together,
and this..." You know...

32:40.680 --> 32:42.039
- That's beautiful. - It is.

32:42.040 --> 32:44.639
I mean, they were probably fighting
about he left the seat up.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.919
And then he says,
"That's our last moment together."

32:46.920 --> 32:49.919
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so the song is...

32:49.920 --> 32:52.559
âª Move along now, people

32:52.560 --> 32:55.199
âª There is nothing here to see

32:55.200 --> 32:57.319
âª It's just me and my lady

32:57.320 --> 32:59.159
âª Having our last memory... âª

32:59.160 --> 33:01.959
You know, that's the way
the song goes, but... Don't stop.

33:01.960 --> 33:05.199
But that's not till...
That's not until the next record.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.159
Now, your new record is inspired by

33:07.160 --> 33:09.439
the legend Nat King Cole,
is that true?

33:09.440 --> 33:11.119
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

33:11.120 --> 33:15.119
I came to Nat's music
when I was a young man,

33:15.120 --> 33:16.639
six or seven.

33:16.640 --> 33:21.479
And just his style, his image,
um, and his voice

33:21.480 --> 33:25.439
was something I needed at the time.
In the absence of my father

33:25.440 --> 33:28.639
hearing these words -
pick yourself up, dust yourself off,

33:28.640 --> 33:32.359
start all over again,
smile though your heart is aching,

33:32.360 --> 33:34.079
the greatest thing
you will ever learn

33:34.080 --> 33:35.799
is just to love
and be loved in return -

33:35.800 --> 33:39.439
- this is fatherly advice, in a way.
- Yeah. - So Nat has been, like,

33:39.440 --> 33:42.119
a great inspiration for me
just over the years.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.879
I think of a song that I wrote
for my son, Don't Lose Your Steam -

33:45.880 --> 33:50.759
that's probably my own alliteration

33:50.760 --> 33:53.959
of pick yourself up,
dust yourself off,

33:53.960 --> 33:55.919
start all over again, you know...
OK.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.799
Don't quit, don't give up,
keep going.

33:58.800 --> 34:03.719
Nat King Cole fact.
1950s, he owned the concession

34:03.720 --> 34:07.359
to sell the Messerschmitt mini car
in California.

34:07.360 --> 34:10.079
Did you know that?
Bet you never knew that.

34:10.080 --> 34:13.438
This is something I didn't know,
and I, like, I pride myself on,

34:13.440 --> 34:15.478
like, really knowing a lot
about Nat.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.400
This, I didn't know. Now I've got to
get me a Messerschmitt, you know.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.280
- Chris is amazing, he knows
all kinds of stupid - BLEEP.

34:24.960 --> 34:28.199
All right, let's take a look at
your tribute to Nat King Cole.

34:30.239 --> 34:35.279
âª Light up your face with gladness

34:35.280 --> 34:40.639
âª Hide every trace of sadness

34:41.920 --> 34:44.879
âª Although a tear

34:44.880 --> 34:51.399
âª May be ever so near

34:51.400 --> 34:58.199
âª That's the time
you must keep on trying

34:58.200 --> 35:03.919
âª Smile, what's the use of crying?

35:03.920 --> 35:11.559
âª You'll find that life
is still worthwhile

35:11.560 --> 35:19.560
âª If you just smile... âª

35:32.280 --> 35:33.959
Thank you.

35:33.960 --> 35:37.959
- I want to watch the whole thing -
that was great. - Thank you, man.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.119
That was great. Yeah.
You know it's funny,

35:40.120 --> 35:43.599
you said something a second ago
about, you know,

35:43.600 --> 35:47.559
being inspired by Nat King Cole and
that you wrote that for your son,

35:47.560 --> 35:48.879
and it's kind of like,

35:48.880 --> 35:51.319
is that how you discipline
your kids, through music?

35:51.320 --> 35:52.679
Do you sing to them?

35:52.680 --> 35:55.559
Because you're
a big, scary-looking guy.

35:55.560 --> 35:57.999
Do you find they take it better
if you sing it to them?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.759
You know it's funny,
last night, um, you know,

36:00.760 --> 36:05.839
I'm talking to my son on Skype,
and he didn't want to go to bed.

36:05.840 --> 36:10.919
And you know, the way my wife
puts, you know,

36:10.920 --> 36:12.999
a little fear into my son

36:13.000 --> 36:16.359
is to turn on one of my records
sometimes, and you know...

36:16.360 --> 36:17.799
Right, you know, so if it's...

36:17.800 --> 36:20.559
âª Sitting on the top
of the roof... âª

36:20.560 --> 36:23.839
You know, he hears that and he's
like, you know, "Is Daddy home?"

36:23.840 --> 36:25.919
Like, "No..."

36:25.920 --> 36:29.039
"Get into bed, boy," you know?
Yeah.

36:29.040 --> 36:32.439
OK, let's take a look at your
training lap with Chris out there.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.679
How did it go with him?

36:33.680 --> 36:35.519
We had a great time out there.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.839
I mean, there is more than
driving going on,

36:37.840 --> 36:40.559
I mean, you're conquering
your fears,

36:40.560 --> 36:43.759
and your desires for safety
you're throwing out the window.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.720
And you know, all of this
is happening and...

36:48.160 --> 36:51.399
So we had a great time,
it was a party, really.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.199
Well, let's take a look.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.639
Gregory, it's an honour
to have you here down at the track

36:55.640 --> 36:58.359
- and you brought sunshine with you.
- Yes, we have a lovely day here.

36:58.360 --> 37:00.879
Daisies, buttercups,
the odd dandelion as well.

37:00.880 --> 37:04.479
- You like a dandelion? - I love
a dandelion. Dandelion greens.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.719
Now, we are in the automatic
version of Toyota's GT86,

37:06.720 --> 37:08.879
which I think is a very pragmatic
decision from you.

37:08.880 --> 37:10.999
Rather than waste time
trying to learn the stick

37:11.000 --> 37:13.759
and the right-hand-drive thing,
let's just get on and go fast.

37:13.760 --> 37:16.919
You know, I am a bit of
a smooth operator,

37:16.920 --> 37:19.399
you know, and I like to
keep it smooth, so yeah.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.359
Let's stick it in D.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.480
Has anyone ever said that to you?

37:25.320 --> 37:26.800
I'm not touching that.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.599
You tell me you're a leisure driver,
but I hate to break it to you -

37:31.600 --> 37:34.279
my job is to extract performance
from you, Gregory.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.199
Yeah, well, listen to that engine,
baby,

37:36.200 --> 37:38.080
this is no leisure
going on right now.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.799
Come on, come on, come on!

37:40.800 --> 37:43.719
- At the 150, we're going to brake.
- OK, we are braking a little bit.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.439
Going to go out towards
the 50 board.

37:45.440 --> 37:48.439
- Follow it to the arrow, and remember
what I said to you? - Yeah, hit it.

37:48.440 --> 37:51.319
Go quick around this left, let's
feel a bit more, feel a bit more.

37:51.320 --> 37:54.079
- That's good!
- It's so deceptive over here.

37:54.080 --> 37:55.599
That... that... that's...

37:55.600 --> 37:58.599
- It's very difficult to see
the horizon point, isn't it? - It is.

37:58.600 --> 38:01.519
OK, round to the left, Chicago,
right-hand side.

38:01.520 --> 38:04.559
- Go on, give it some gas,
give it some gas, give it some gas.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.199
- Let's do it, unh! Here we go,
here we go. - Give it some...

38:07.200 --> 38:09.679
- What was that noise? - Here we go!
- What was that noise?

38:09.680 --> 38:11.079
Yes!

38:11.080 --> 38:13.679
Can you make some of
those soulful noises?

38:13.680 --> 38:17.519
- Unh! Ha-ha! Hey-hey!
- That's it, that's good.

38:17.520 --> 38:21.160
This is mine, this is mine,
mine, Hammerhead.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.639
- You are owning Hammerhead.
- Here we go, here we go!

38:26.640 --> 38:29.519
- Now through between the tyres...
- Yeah. - ..and the grass.

38:29.520 --> 38:31.999
This is the tyre wall.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.959
Woo! Yes, to the left.

38:33.960 --> 38:37.359
Brake at the 50, brake at the 50,
brake, brake, brake.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.919
Harder brake, harder brake,
harder brake.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.919
Brake, brake, left now, left now.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.359
We could be off.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.319
You said you wanted some grass!

38:47.320 --> 38:49.159
I give you grass.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.719
Over the line.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.359
- Woo! - And let's stop there.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.839
That was good!

38:53.840 --> 38:55.519
Enjoy?

38:55.520 --> 38:58.559
You are... you are...
You are a dark horse,

38:58.560 --> 39:00.399
because you've come along,
Mr Soulful,

39:00.400 --> 39:01.999
"I'm just going to palm it round."

39:02.000 --> 39:04.279
But you know the lap,
and you're driving well.

39:04.280 --> 39:06.399
Yeah, yeah, feels good, feels good.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.479
I could do this... I could do this
for a career, actually.

39:09.480 --> 39:12.279
- I think you could.
- You know, this music thing is,

39:12.280 --> 39:15.679
you know - when it starts to
wind down, watch out.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.839
Before we go any further,
come on, the crash helmet.

39:26.840 --> 39:29.159
The guys in production
did you a special crash helmet...

39:29.160 --> 39:30.919
- Yeah! - ..with the signature look.

39:30.920 --> 39:33.519
I'm not sure it passes
any of the FIA standards,

39:33.520 --> 39:35.599
but it's a lovely touch.
It looks great.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.239
Yeah, yeah, that was a lot of fun.

39:37.240 --> 39:39.599
And you guys are about
having fun here,

39:39.600 --> 39:41.519
as well as, you know...

39:41.520 --> 39:44.279
And I probably won't
drive the same any more.

39:44.280 --> 39:45.639
I'll be like, you know...

39:45.640 --> 39:48.319
You'll be the quick guy
in the neighbourhood now.

39:48.320 --> 39:50.679
All right, let's talk car history.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.439
What was your first car?

39:52.440 --> 39:56.479
My first car was a '67 Galaxie 500.

39:56.480 --> 39:58.279
Had a nice 390 in it...

39:58.280 --> 40:00.519
You know, the first car
you learn how to drive in...

40:00.520 --> 40:02.999
You know, I was going to school
at San Diego State,

40:03.000 --> 40:06.239
and I was driving back and forth,
you know, four-hour drive,

40:06.240 --> 40:09.879
going to see my mom
almost every other weekend.

40:09.880 --> 40:13.199
And, you know,
that was my horse, you know?

40:13.200 --> 40:14.679
And you have a relationship

40:14.680 --> 40:17.039
with the horse that takes you home,
you know?

40:17.040 --> 40:19.519
There's a big car theme
going on here, isn't there?

40:19.520 --> 40:21.439
Yeah, there is.

40:21.440 --> 40:25.799
One of my favourite cars that I had
was the '68 Lincoln Continental.

40:25.800 --> 40:28.399
- You had one of those?
- Which is one of the longest cars.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.799
- Look at that.
- And the back doors were suicide.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.359
- Suicide doors. - Yeah.

40:32.360 --> 40:33.999
And I would park near the ocean.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.079
When I was in college,
I would park near the ocean

40:37.080 --> 40:40.959
and open the doors and roll
the front seats all the way up

40:40.960 --> 40:44.479
and, basically, the back seat
was essentially just a couch.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.879
And I would just dream,

40:46.880 --> 40:50.119
dream about stuff like this,
stuff like today.

40:50.120 --> 40:53.079
And, you know,
so now it's a dream come true.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.919
But, yeah, I loved that car.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.439
That's a big car, you like big cars.

40:56.440 --> 40:58.679
And speaking of big cars,
we've got a photo here

40:58.680 --> 41:01.399
with a couple of big cars in them.
What's going on here?

41:01.400 --> 41:06.199
Yeah, I was like a Rolls-Royce
ambassador for a few months

41:06.200 --> 41:12.079
and we actually did a performance
at the factory here in the UK

41:12.080 --> 41:15.359
and it was really amazing
to walk the assembly line.

41:15.360 --> 41:18.719
I mean, things that you don't think
that you will ever do,

41:18.720 --> 41:20.359
this was kind of one of them.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.479
When you look at the sticker price
of a Rolls-Royce,

41:22.480 --> 41:24.919
you think they're expensive,
then you see them being built

41:24.920 --> 41:27.599
- and they suddenly look like good
value, don't they? - Right, right.

41:27.600 --> 41:32.319
There's a sweet old lady stitching
the leather on the steering wheels.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.159
It was really, really extraordinary.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.479
So what is your dream car?

41:36.480 --> 41:37.999
Um...

41:38.000 --> 41:41.159
You know, the Bentley...

41:41.160 --> 41:43.119
Er...

41:43.120 --> 41:47.159
The Bentley Mulsanne, is, um...
Yeah, it's a beautiful car,

41:47.160 --> 41:49.999
and I've had some opportunities
to ride in one.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.119
- Yeah, it's great. - Cool.

41:51.120 --> 41:54.159
- Well, I'm sure Rolls-Royce will be
happy to hear all about that. - Yeah.

41:56.840 --> 42:00.599
OK, I think it's time
we take a look at your timed lap.

42:00.600 --> 42:01.879
You're funny, man.

42:01.880 --> 42:04.799
After you finished with Chris,
you went out there on your own

42:04.800 --> 42:07.759
- and... what happened? - Um...

42:07.760 --> 42:09.719
Well, I had an exciting time.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.959
It ain't no fun unless
you experience the spin, baby.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.519
You've got to know
where the limit is.

42:13.520 --> 42:16.800
- Right, you have got to know where
the limit is. - Look at this. - Push.

42:18.080 --> 42:19.679
Whoo!

42:35.280 --> 42:36.959
- It made the best noise. - Yeah.

42:36.960 --> 42:39.839
We all heard it, we heard it
and it started and it didn't end.

42:39.840 --> 42:42.199
We were all going, "What was...?"

42:42.200 --> 42:43.359
That's what I kept saying.

42:43.360 --> 42:46.719
I was like, "When is this bad boy
going to stop?" And it didn't.

42:46.720 --> 42:49.039
And how did it go when you
actually got a timed lap in?

42:49.040 --> 42:52.239
- How do you think it went?
- I think it went pretty good.

42:52.240 --> 42:55.759
I felt like I was pushing it,
I felt like I was, you know...

42:55.760 --> 43:00.439
..owning Chicago
and owning, you know, Hammerhead.

43:00.440 --> 43:03.399
I felt like...
I felt pretty good for a second.

43:03.400 --> 43:05.680
- Well, let's take a look.
- Yeah, we'll see.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.920
All right, pedal to the metal.

43:13.160 --> 43:16.079
Nice and smooth off the line -
automatic, so you should be, really.

43:16.080 --> 43:20.279
About to come down hard
on these brakes right...

43:20.280 --> 43:22.239
..now.

43:22.240 --> 43:23.759
The line looks good,

43:23.760 --> 43:26.119
- the speed looks good. - Yeah.

43:26.120 --> 43:27.799
Using most of the circuit as well.

43:27.800 --> 43:30.359
This is tricky, you've got to get
the car turned into Chicago

43:30.360 --> 43:31.479
and brake hard.

43:31.480 --> 43:33.319
Keeping it real this time.

43:33.320 --> 43:34.600
OK, here we go.

43:35.680 --> 43:38.719
But, again, letting the car
run wide, using all the circuit.

43:38.720 --> 43:41.719
Listen to that little 2-litre
four-cylinder motor sing.

43:41.720 --> 43:45.919
Loving this straightaway. The
straightaways are nice and easy.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.639
Why do you say "straightaway"?
It's a straight!

43:49.880 --> 43:51.479
Braking hard into Hammerhead.

43:51.480 --> 43:54.200
Flick left right -
that challenges the car massively.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.959
I think that looks
like another good line.

43:57.960 --> 44:00.119
Yeah, baby!

44:00.120 --> 44:01.199
Give me what I want!

44:03.840 --> 44:06.399
It's out of control
but it's in control, you know?

44:06.400 --> 44:09.319
This is where we had to push you
harder through this right-hander,

44:09.320 --> 44:12.599
- through the Follow-Through.
Again, that looks fast. - Yeah.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.639
Through the tyre wall,
the scene of your spin.

44:14.640 --> 44:16.479
A little bit of brake light.

44:16.480 --> 44:20.079
Slightly mad but stay controlled,
there you go.

44:20.080 --> 44:22.799
Second to last, now this is very
difficult to spot, isn't it?

44:22.800 --> 44:25.399
- That's good over the inside. -!

44:25.400 --> 44:26.919
Through Gambon, towards the line.

44:26.920 --> 44:28.799
What are we going to see here,
some theatrics?

44:28.800 --> 44:31.719
I reckon that's neat and tidy.
That looked like a fast lap.

44:35.080 --> 44:37.719
Did pretty... That looked tight.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.079
I'm not mad about it.

44:39.080 --> 44:41.279
That looked pretty tight.

44:41.280 --> 44:42.839
I don't know, I don't know.

44:42.840 --> 44:45.399
I think I did all right.
I don't know.

44:45.400 --> 44:48.039
All right, there's the leader board.
Where would you like to be?

44:48.040 --> 44:52.399
You know, as long as I am above
Tinie Tempah, I think I'll be OK.

44:52.400 --> 44:55.679
Cos, you know, I'm a jazz cat,
sometimes they think

44:55.680 --> 44:58.439
the jazz cats
are a little too cool, but...

44:58.440 --> 45:01.799
He had a wet time, so he's
down there cos it was raining.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.999
- It was a rain time.
- Don't give him excuses.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.079
Excuses, excuses. Yeah.

45:06.080 --> 45:07.480
All right.

45:08.520 --> 45:12.839
Gregory Porter, you went
around our humble little track

45:12.840 --> 45:14.240
in one minute...

45:15.200 --> 45:16.240
..40...

45:18.440 --> 45:20.119
..three... AUDIENCE: Ooh!

45:20.120 --> 45:21.639
Wow.

45:21.640 --> 45:23.800
- ..point 4. - OK!

45:24.880 --> 45:26.519
Fantastic result, mate.

45:26.520 --> 45:28.680
Well done. Look at that.

45:31.640 --> 45:33.199
That's all right.

45:33.200 --> 45:35.279
- That's good. - A great effort.

45:35.280 --> 45:36.559
I feel good about that.

45:36.560 --> 45:38.559
Ladies and gentlemen,
Gregory Porter!

45:38.560 --> 45:40.679
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

45:40.680 --> 45:43.600
Thanks for coming. Thanks so much.

45:51.240 --> 45:53.679
- I like that guy. - Yeah.
- What a good guy.

45:53.680 --> 45:58.919
All right. Now, there are fast cars
and there are FAST cars,

45:58.920 --> 46:03.479
but every now and then one comes
along that is so damn fast

46:03.480 --> 46:08.279
that even grisly, seen-it-all-before
veterans like Chris Harris

46:08.280 --> 46:10.759
get all giggly and excited.

46:10.760 --> 46:13.720
So, have a look at this.

46:17.160 --> 46:18.640
It's this.

46:22.320 --> 46:25.840
The Porsche 911 GT2 RS.

46:27.600 --> 46:30.680
A Â£230,000 riot...

46:32.640 --> 46:36.760
..of wings, vents, holes
and stripes.

46:40.240 --> 46:42.439
But before you dismiss it
as just a 911

46:42.440 --> 46:46.040
that's been driven through Halfords
with a magnet strapped to it...

46:47.600 --> 46:52.480
..trust me, this is one of the most
exciting cars of the decade.

46:53.880 --> 46:55.319
Woo-hoo-hoo!

46:57.480 --> 47:00.080
700 horsepower
from those twin turbos.

47:01.720 --> 47:04.719
0 to 60? 2.7 seconds.

47:04.720 --> 47:07.439
And a top speed of 211.

47:07.440 --> 47:11.479
150, 160, 170...

47:11.480 --> 47:13.000
That's insane.

47:14.760 --> 47:18.719
Just sucks up the world
and punches you out the other side!

47:18.720 --> 47:20.079
Wow!

47:20.080 --> 47:22.399
Looks like a 911,

47:22.400 --> 47:24.240
goes like a hyper car.

47:27.520 --> 47:30.599
And you know the really crazy thing
about this car?

47:30.600 --> 47:33.919
It's limited to 211
but, if it was left unlimited,

47:33.920 --> 47:36.919
it would do 223mph.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.199
And the only reason it
doesn't is that Porsche

47:39.200 --> 47:42.360
would have to develop an entirely
new tyre to handle the speed.

47:43.680 --> 47:46.079
Even as it is, though, don't worry -

47:46.080 --> 47:50.839
the GT2 RS still gives its tyres
plenty to think about.

48:01.640 --> 48:04.319
Not many cars can do this.
Watch this. Into Hammerhead,

48:04.320 --> 48:06.919
a bit of a tweak one way,
a bit of a tweak the other.

48:06.920 --> 48:10.439
Get it going in second,
grab third... Wait for it.

48:10.440 --> 48:13.999
..grab fourth
and it's still sliding!

48:17.040 --> 48:18.440
Whoa-ho-ho!

48:19.880 --> 48:22.440
I've never driven a car
that can do that before.

48:23.960 --> 48:28.720
This is the feral, deranged
banshee of a car.

48:30.080 --> 48:33.839
This is a new level of hooliganry.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.919
Now, Porsche has made GT2s before,

48:42.920 --> 48:45.279
but they're always a bit
of an afterthought.

48:45.280 --> 48:48.479
Take a 911 turbo,
remove the front driveshafts,

48:48.480 --> 48:51.240
add some silly wings,
hope for the best.

48:52.840 --> 48:57.039
But this one?
No, this is properly engineered.

48:57.040 --> 48:58.600
Allow me to explain.

49:01.520 --> 49:06.759
To save weight, the front wings,
bonnet, roof and rear spoiler

49:06.760 --> 49:09.319
are all made of carbon fibre.

49:09.320 --> 49:13.959
The wheels are magnesium,
the brakes carbon ceramic,

49:13.960 --> 49:17.359
while, underneath the bodywork,
the engine features new pistons,

49:17.360 --> 49:19.679
intercoolers, a new intake and...

49:21.800 --> 49:24.439
..a titanium exhaust.

49:24.440 --> 49:26.679
And the result
of this forensic overhaul

49:26.680 --> 49:30.200
is the fastest production car
ever to lap the Nurburgring.

49:32.440 --> 49:34.839
Yes!

49:34.840 --> 49:36.400
Porsche, yes!

49:37.880 --> 49:41.719
I'd like to say
it's a racing car for the road.

49:41.720 --> 49:43.879
But I don't think
I've ever driven a racing car

49:43.880 --> 49:45.400
that accelerates like this.

49:51.720 --> 49:54.159
Listen to those gear changes.

49:54.160 --> 49:57.199
This is the best paddle-shift
gearbox I've ever driven,

49:57.200 --> 49:59.159
and I'm using the lever
in the middle.

49:59.160 --> 50:01.879
Makes me feel
like a '90s touring car racer.

50:01.880 --> 50:03.120
Rargh!

50:05.320 --> 50:07.799
And spare a thought
for the traction control,

50:07.800 --> 50:11.039
because in a road car
this track-focused,

50:11.040 --> 50:14.439
make no mistake,
it is a life-saver.

50:14.440 --> 50:17.319
I mean, these buttons,
when you turn everything off,

50:17.320 --> 50:20.160
you've got to be
really, really careful.

50:21.520 --> 50:25.399
They called the old GT2 RS
"The Widow Maker",

50:25.400 --> 50:29.479
but this new one
is faster and scarier.

50:29.480 --> 50:31.000
So what does that make it?

50:33.040 --> 50:35.399
The Grim Reaper?

50:35.400 --> 50:38.479
Typically, the producers
wanted to find out

50:38.480 --> 50:41.519
and told me to report
back for a little test...

50:45.200 --> 50:47.760
..in conditions like this.

50:49.360 --> 50:51.039
And the producers have ordered me

50:51.040 --> 50:53.679
to demonstrate
just how scary the GT2 RS is

50:53.680 --> 50:56.159
by using their latest invention,

50:56.160 --> 50:59.799
the Fear-O-Meter 3000.

50:59.800 --> 51:04.399
Which says here
is "quantifying pant-based panic

51:04.400 --> 51:08.799
"by measuring
the emissions of the driver".

51:08.800 --> 51:10.439
Just demeaning.

51:10.440 --> 51:11.639
Ridiculous.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.679
I was the road test editor
of Autocar.

51:13.680 --> 51:17.039
So standard 911 going first
to give us a base reading

51:17.040 --> 51:19.399
because this is science. Allegedly.

51:19.400 --> 51:24.439
You just don't want those cables
and the crocodile clip...

51:24.440 --> 51:28.359
Traction control off,
lairy as possible round Hammerhead.

51:31.440 --> 51:34.920
400 horsepower, rear-wheel drive,
let's see what it's like.

51:41.320 --> 51:43.760
I mean, it's just
so easy and smooth.

51:46.080 --> 51:48.760
Loads of torque,
barely moving the steering wheel.

51:50.360 --> 51:52.000
It feels lovely.

51:53.400 --> 51:55.839
Not much to be scared of there.
What have we got here?

51:55.840 --> 51:57.079
87.

51:57.080 --> 51:58.759
Ooh, I don't know what that means.

51:58.760 --> 51:59.919
87...

51:59.920 --> 52:01.320
"Mild puckering".

52:02.480 --> 52:03.880
Seems about right.

52:06.960 --> 52:09.159
Now the GT2 RS.

52:12.520 --> 52:15.040
I won't lie,
I'm fairly nervous about this.

52:18.600 --> 52:19.920
Good Lord!

52:24.560 --> 52:26.199
Second gear, second gear.

52:27.640 --> 52:30.199
That's way too lairy,
let's try third.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.679
Third's just as bad.

52:31.680 --> 52:32.999
What about fourth?

52:33.000 --> 52:34.440
God...

52:35.680 --> 52:37.800
It's like a wasp with toothache.

52:39.120 --> 52:41.079
Whoa!

52:41.080 --> 52:42.640
And stop, and please stop.

52:48.480 --> 52:51.399
793?!

52:51.400 --> 52:53.120
793...

52:54.520 --> 52:57.959
"Extreme seepage"?

52:57.960 --> 53:01.040
And that, supposedly, is science.

53:02.280 --> 53:05.639
I think a boil wash
for the Fear-O-Meter.

53:05.640 --> 53:07.359
A boil wash.

53:07.360 --> 53:09.359
Grim Reaper it is, then.

53:09.360 --> 53:12.279
But here's the thing
about the GT2 RS.

53:12.280 --> 53:15.199
Right, now, don't be silly,
turn everything back on.

53:15.200 --> 53:18.599
Let it help you
and, in these conditions,

53:18.600 --> 53:20.040
it is breathtaking.

53:24.080 --> 53:25.320
Woohoo!

53:27.400 --> 53:28.720
Look at that.

53:29.880 --> 53:33.520
This is now the un-spinnable
700 horsepower 911.

53:37.480 --> 53:40.199
The real hero here
is the chassis systems,

53:40.200 --> 53:42.239
the traction control, the stability,

53:42.240 --> 53:46.239
the endless hours that Porsche spent
driving round racetracks going,

53:46.240 --> 53:49.479
"Add a bit as assistance there,
take that away."

53:49.480 --> 53:51.559
Those are the real heroes
of this car

53:51.560 --> 53:54.520
because, without them,
I don't think it would be drivable.

53:57.120 --> 53:58.719
What a machine.

53:58.720 --> 54:02.480
This is a flipping triumph,
this thing is. It's so clever.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.039
Big turbo-charged super cars
were always quite flabby and loose,

54:09.040 --> 54:10.399
they were imprecise.

54:10.400 --> 54:12.439
You needed lots of space around you

54:12.440 --> 54:14.999
to give them room
for what they might do.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.399
But not the GT2 RS.

54:17.400 --> 54:20.799
OK, it's intimidating
and it's bloody fast

54:20.800 --> 54:23.319
and it will spit you off
if you turn all the systems off,

54:23.320 --> 54:25.599
but leave them on...

54:25.600 --> 54:28.280
Well, this thing is so capable.

54:30.240 --> 54:33.279
In fact, it's much more than that.

54:33.280 --> 54:37.759
The GT2 RS is a savage,
ferocious machine,

54:37.760 --> 54:42.319
its enormous power tamed
by some of the finest engineering

54:42.320 --> 54:44.320
I've ever experienced in a road car.

54:45.440 --> 54:49.079
I think, most of all, it just
feels like it's been developed

54:49.080 --> 54:52.239
by a bunch of people
who really love driving

54:52.240 --> 54:54.800
and also really know how to drive.

54:56.800 --> 55:00.880
Quite simply, it is nothing
short of a masterpiece.

55:02.360 --> 55:05.719
Porsche has always made
some of the best sports cars,

55:05.720 --> 55:11.719
but this might just be
the greatest fast 911 ever built.

55:11.720 --> 55:12.800
There, I said it.

55:19.800 --> 55:22.800
Come on.

55:23.840 --> 55:25.360
Unreal.

55:28.360 --> 55:30.639
It is not very often
that I'll say this,

55:30.640 --> 55:32.239
but I am jealous of you.

55:32.240 --> 55:34.879
That looked absolutely berserk.

55:34.880 --> 55:37.599
I love this car. 700 horsepower?

55:37.600 --> 55:39.159
You know the craziest thing?

55:39.160 --> 55:41.719
All you need
is a normal driver's licence.

55:41.720 --> 55:44.239
Yeah, if you're allowed
to drive a Smart car,

55:44.240 --> 55:45.959
you're allowed drive this.

55:45.960 --> 55:49.239
That's like... That's like taking
a basic first-aid course

55:49.240 --> 55:51.079
and being allowed
to do open heart surgery.

55:52.440 --> 55:55.199
Honestly, it's one of
the fastest cars I've ever driven.

55:55.200 --> 55:58.119
In fact, it must be one
of the fastest cars ever made.

55:58.120 --> 56:00.599
Surely it's right at the top
of our leader board.

56:00.600 --> 56:03.999
It's got to be right
near the top, if not at the top.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.359
So what do we do?

56:05.360 --> 56:07.919
We send it around our track...

56:07.920 --> 56:10.119
..with the Stig.

56:10.120 --> 56:12.720
700 horsepower, two-wheel-drive 911.

56:14.880 --> 56:17.679
Stiggy looking very calm,
using all the track.

56:17.680 --> 56:20.359
Look how flat the thing is.

56:20.360 --> 56:22.359
Over 550 foot-pounds of torque.

56:22.360 --> 56:25.559
Not that heavy, about 1,450 kg.

56:25.560 --> 56:27.519
This has got the Weissach pack,

56:27.520 --> 56:29.759
which has got a titanium
rear cage in it.

56:29.760 --> 56:31.319
Look how stable the thing looks -

56:31.320 --> 56:33.999
the 991's got a longer wheelbase
and a wider front tractor,

56:34.000 --> 56:36.159
so it has less understeer
than older 911s.

56:36.160 --> 56:38.919
It means it can carry speed.
That Michelin Cup 2 tyre -

56:38.920 --> 56:42.599
super sticky, about three compounds
across it, giving massive grip.

56:42.600 --> 56:45.999
Look at the traction out of here -
it'll rocket out of Hammerhead.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.599
Just winding up through the gears.

56:47.600 --> 56:49.439
He's a very happy man
in his white suit.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.639
Again, using all the track.

56:51.640 --> 56:55.279
Very calmly tipping it
in through Follow-Through.

56:55.280 --> 56:58.399
A lot of aero on this car as well -
that wing is not just cosmetic.

56:58.400 --> 57:00.359
My God, oversteer on the exit.

57:00.360 --> 57:02.679
I mean, that was a Code Brown.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.239
Braking hard on the second to last.

57:04.240 --> 57:07.159
Look at the way that it just keys
into the tarmac.!

57:07.160 --> 57:09.199
Using all of the track,
a little bit of a slide.

57:09.200 --> 57:12.199
Through Gambon. I mean, it looks
speeded up. It looks speeded up!

57:12.200 --> 57:13.239
Wow!

57:16.920 --> 57:19.039
I'm excited, come on.

57:19.040 --> 57:20.959
OK.

57:20.960 --> 57:23.639
The lap board. Now, we're not
looking anywhere down here -

57:23.640 --> 57:25.319
we're looking way up here
at the top.

57:25.320 --> 57:28.719
The McLaren 675 LT,
the fastest car ever,

57:28.720 --> 57:31.479
around our track at 1.13.7.

57:31.480 --> 57:33.599
- That's pretty quick.
- That's stupid quick.

57:33.600 --> 57:36.079
Can a 911 really beat that?

57:36.080 --> 57:37.359
I don't know, let's find out.

57:37.360 --> 57:39.800
- Shall we find out? Yeah.
- Yeah!

57:40.920 --> 57:42.159
OK.

57:42.160 --> 57:47.760
The new Porsche 911 GT2 RS
went round in one minute...

57:48.920 --> 57:50.039
..13...

57:50.040 --> 57:51.799
Ooh!

57:51.800 --> 57:53.279
..point 4!

57:56.480 --> 57:58.039
There it is.

57:58.040 --> 57:59.399
We have a new champion.

57:59.400 --> 58:02.399
- That's incredible. - Fantastic.
That is incredible, yeah.

58:02.400 --> 58:05.639
That is incredible. I-I'm not sure
that's going to be beaten.

58:05.640 --> 58:08.319
Yeah, it'll be a while
before something beats that.

58:08.320 --> 58:11.199
And on that record-breaking note,
we must end the show.

58:11.200 --> 58:14.119
We'll see you next week.
Goodnight.
