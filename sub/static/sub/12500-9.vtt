00:26.608 --> 00:29.909
Oh, where those your
parents? Poor little guy.

00:29.910 --> 00:33.071
Oh, well. Time erases
traumatic memories.

00:33.072 --> 00:36.585
At least that's what my Scout Leader
told me when he made me suck his...

00:36.586 --> 00:38.005
Hmm...

00:38.006 --> 00:39.789
Huh. It does work.

00:39.790 --> 00:42.324
Don't worry, little cub.
I'll take care of you.

00:42.325 --> 00:44.923
Son, never forget us.

00:44.924 --> 00:47.959
Never forget where you came from.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.394
Googoo, gaa-gaa...

00:49.395 --> 00:52.395
God damn, I'm good.

00:52.398 --> 00:55.499
Malloy, what do you say we take
a hike and connect with nature?

00:55.500 --> 00:57.733
I have all the nature I need right here.

00:57.734 --> 01:01.154
Die, you worthless animals!

01:05.542 --> 01:08.422
Extinction achieved!

01:08.779 --> 01:13.639
So this shit was rated
"E" for everyone, huh?

01:15.784 --> 01:16.879
Aah!

01:16.880 --> 01:19.412
<i>♪Brickleberry!</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:21.993
<i>♪Brickleberry!</i>

01:25.293 --> 01:27.498
Oh, God. It's that day again.

01:27.499 --> 01:31.639
It's Malloy's parents' murderversary.

01:33.148 --> 01:34.949
Don't look guilty. Don't look guilty.

01:34.950 --> 01:36.683
- Steve?
- Aah! I'm sorry!

01:36.684 --> 01:39.217
- Uh, for what?
- Uh, uh...

01:39.218 --> 01:40.320
Oh!

01:40.321 --> 01:42.655
For that. Just wanted
to apologize beforehand.

01:42.656 --> 01:44.596
Apology accepted, Steve.

01:44.597 --> 01:47.494
Steve, don't you ever
hit Connie with a chair!

01:47.495 --> 01:50.051
Use the Connie club.
That's what it's there for.

01:50.052 --> 01:53.867
Now listen up, Rangers. It's
April 22nd. Also known as...

01:53.868 --> 01:55.723
The day that Malloy's
parents were killed!

01:55.724 --> 01:58.004
No. Earth Day.

01:58.005 --> 02:00.171
Jesus, Steve. Why
would you bring that up?

02:00.172 --> 02:03.259
Well, not because there's a horrible
memory or crushing guilt weighing on me.

02:03.260 --> 02:04.736
Oh, look at the time.

02:04.737 --> 02:06.537
Ah!

02:13.185 --> 02:15.553
Woody, since when do
you care about Earth Day?

02:15.554 --> 02:17.655
Since always, Ethel.

02:17.656 --> 02:19.547
Earth is my planet.

02:19.548 --> 02:24.405
And my planet is full of soupy dipshits
who go to National Parks on Earth Day

02:24.406 --> 02:27.498
to pretend to give a flying
sheep's queef about nature.

02:27.499 --> 02:30.835
AKA, this is the day we
makes da mad Benjamins.

02:30.836 --> 02:32.179
Am I right, Denzel?

02:32.180 --> 02:34.907
Yeah, you would be, if this was
the early '90s and you were black.

02:34.908 --> 02:37.302
Actually, Denzel, it
wasn't until the late '90s

02:37.303 --> 02:39.209
when "Benjamins" entered
the black verna...

02:39.210 --> 02:40.310
Oh!

02:40.311 --> 02:44.031
Denzel! It's three steps away!

02:54.724 --> 02:56.258
Ooh, almost had it.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.415
My God! What is the point of this?

02:58.416 --> 03:00.250
It's for the environment, Ethel.

03:00.251 --> 03:05.455
I'm trying to return this trout to
its natural habitat... that deep fryer.

03:05.456 --> 03:06.889
Jackpot!

03:06.890 --> 03:08.224
Woody, this is a joke.

03:08.225 --> 03:13.445
Your "celebration of nature"
is destroying our park.

03:15.265 --> 03:17.099
Ethel, that offends me.

03:17.100 --> 03:22.080
Now shut up and help me
oil up these pelicans.

03:22.706 --> 03:23.772
Malloy!

03:23.773 --> 03:26.308
There's my best little orphaned friend.

03:26.309 --> 03:27.309
What is up with you?

03:27.310 --> 03:30.212
Every year, around this time, you
start acting weirder than usual.

03:30.213 --> 03:33.549
Nonsense. Here, I got you a card.

03:33.550 --> 03:38.410
"So your parents died
in a gruesome accident".

03:41.691 --> 03:43.725
"Better luck next time".

03:43.726 --> 03:45.860
Uh, how is this supposed to cheer me up?

03:45.861 --> 03:47.061
Sorry. What else can I do?

03:47.062 --> 03:49.897
- How about stick your dick in a beehive?
- On it.

03:49.898 --> 03:52.967
- Honeybee or yellow jacket?
- Whichever one's more aggressive.

03:52.968 --> 03:54.686
Yellow jacket it is.

03:54.687 --> 03:56.670
Huh, this isn't so bad.

03:56.671 --> 03:57.671
It kind of tickles.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.592
Aagh!

03:59.674 --> 04:00.741
Now it's bad!

04:00.742 --> 04:03.076
Aah! They're stinging my penis.

04:03.077 --> 04:06.179
They are really stinging my penis!

04:06.180 --> 04:08.909
Something must have pissed them off. Oh!

04:08.910 --> 04:11.418
Wow, that actually cheered me
up more than I thought it would.

04:11.419 --> 04:14.839
Okay. I'll stick with it.

04:15.823 --> 04:19.591
Well, time to do my
part for the environment.

04:19.593 --> 04:25.493
Well, not only is it quiet, it's
the safest car on the ro... aah!

04:35.909 --> 04:41.369
This really is quiet. They
can't even hear me coming.

04:45.387 --> 04:46.552
What?

04:46.553 --> 04:49.021
Malloy, it's Steve. I'm
calling from the hospital.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.470
Turns out I'm allergic
to yellow jackets.

04:51.471 --> 04:54.539
The good news is, my
penis is now 13 inches...

04:54.540 --> 04:57.864
- Wide.
- Feel free to never call me again, okay?

04:57.865 --> 05:00.433
Ah. This is the life.

05:00.434 --> 05:03.469
Hello, bear. We need to talk.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.110
Jessica Simpson?

05:08.074 --> 05:12.846
Oh, so this is the animal
that thinks he is a human.

05:12.847 --> 05:14.414
Hello, human.

05:14.415 --> 05:18.675
Can we get you some answering machine?

05:20.221 --> 05:23.701
Or perhaps a McBurger King?

05:25.693 --> 05:28.307
Is this, like, a... is
this Tyler Perry humor?

05:28.308 --> 05:30.396
- Because I do not get it.
- Silence!

05:30.397 --> 05:35.033
Look at these animals that you drove upon
with your fuel-efficient death machine.

05:35.034 --> 05:37.311
I didn't see a single
animal crossing sign.

05:37.312 --> 05:39.805
- So whose fault's that?
- Screw you, human lover.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.340
Let me eat this pussy, boss.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.243
Easy, Joe Wolf. No one
will be eating pussy today.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.711
Ah, man.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.479
The bear is not to blame.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.581
The humans made him this way.

05:49.582 --> 05:53.619
I am Moose Nazir, leader of the animals.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.787
Welcome to my humble home.

05:55.788 --> 06:00.888
Please, bring this honored
guest our finest foods.

06:01.127 --> 06:03.596
So all your other foods
are worse than this?

06:03.597 --> 06:06.499
Come now, this is a great
delicacy for an animal.

06:06.500 --> 06:11.470
I harvest these larvae myself, from
the anus of a magnificent elk carcass.

06:11.471 --> 06:14.874
I just had the bottomless bowl of
ass maggots at the Olive Garden.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.396
Sorry, I am gonna...
oh, I gotta go home.

06:18.397 --> 06:19.711
To the human world?

06:19.712 --> 06:22.979
You don't belong there. What
is so wrong with this place?

06:22.980 --> 06:24.616
Um, ass maggots.

06:24.617 --> 06:27.659
Fair enough. You are free to go.

06:27.660 --> 06:32.290
I just thought you might want to know
what really happened to your parents.

06:32.291 --> 06:35.193
My parents were accidentally
killed by a tourist.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.496
Huh? Killed by a tortoise?

06:37.497 --> 06:38.997
No, a tourist.

06:38.998 --> 06:41.574
Who you calling a tourist,
you uppity little bitch?

06:41.575 --> 06:44.036
I've lived here for 273 years.

06:44.037 --> 06:47.609
I did blow off Sacagawea's ass!

06:47.610 --> 06:50.876
Oh, you poor, misguided bear.

06:50.877 --> 06:53.736
You live, eat, sleep
among the human Rangers.

06:53.737 --> 06:59.051
And yet you don't know that one of your
beloved Rangers murdered your parents!

06:59.052 --> 07:00.753
What? That's impossible.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.688
I saw it with my own eyes.

07:02.689 --> 07:05.324
Holy shit. Who was it?

07:05.325 --> 07:07.126
I don't know. They all
look the same to me.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.295
I know which one it was.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.265
- The purple one.
- Wolves are color-blind, Joe Wolf!

07:12.266 --> 07:14.428
You don't know what the
[Bleep] you're talking about.

07:14.429 --> 07:16.836
- He sounded purple.
- How could they?

07:16.837 --> 07:19.439
Feel the anger surge through your veins.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.507
Let it overtake you.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.093
I want blood.

07:23.094 --> 07:25.318
As dipping sauce for ass maggots, right?

07:25.319 --> 07:26.813
No, for revenge.

07:26.814 --> 07:31.050
Well, revenge is a dish
best served with ass maggots.

07:31.051 --> 07:35.851
Seriously, just try one
of these ass maggots.

07:36.353 --> 07:37.687
I just don't get it.

07:37.688 --> 07:39.756
Why would a ranger kill my parents?

07:39.757 --> 07:41.617
Because humans are evil.

07:41.618 --> 07:44.994
This injuries are just from
the Earth Day celebration.

07:44.995 --> 07:47.664
Our doctors have been
working around the clock.

07:47.665 --> 07:49.465
Give me your report, Dr. Gooseniak.

07:49.466 --> 07:52.530
Hmm, this fox has a serious head wound.

07:52.531 --> 07:54.570
Lick it.

07:54.571 --> 07:57.318
This skunk has a severely broken leg.

07:57.319 --> 07:59.208
Lick it.

07:59.209 --> 08:01.744
And this raccoon has a sprained penis.

08:01.745 --> 08:04.180
Gary, you've sprained your
penis every day this week.

08:04.181 --> 08:06.915
What can I say? I lead an active life.

08:06.916 --> 08:08.937
Now make with the licking.

08:08.938 --> 08:11.629
Humans have always mistreated animals.

08:11.630 --> 08:12.888
What can I do to help?

08:12.889 --> 08:15.405
Malloy, you are the only one that can

08:15.406 --> 08:18.393
communicate our demands
to those filthy humans.

08:18.394 --> 08:22.627
Take up our cause, and I promise
you vengeance for your parents.

08:22.628 --> 08:23.961
I'll do it.

08:23.962 --> 08:29.002
Oh, I just remembered.
I also sprained my balls.

08:30.068 --> 08:32.967
The bad news is, the yellow
jackets that burrowed up my pee hole

08:32.967 --> 08:34.552
made a nest out of my prostate.

08:34.553 --> 08:36.674
Jesus, what's the good news?

08:36.674 --> 08:38.491
- I'm pissing honey.
- Yuck!

08:38.491 --> 08:42.145
Wow, Malloy. You look so
serious. Everything all...

08:42.145 --> 08:43.708
Silence, human.

08:43.710 --> 08:45.411
Malloy, what's wrong?

08:45.412 --> 08:47.713
You've never called Connie human before.

08:47.714 --> 08:49.615
Because that's what you all are.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.751
And we have a lot of
problems with humans.

08:52.752 --> 08:55.120
Oh, yeah? Who's "we"?

08:55.121 --> 08:58.156
Did you make some new furry friends?

08:58.157 --> 08:59.390
Good for you.

08:59.391 --> 09:01.726
Here's a list of all of our demands.

09:01.727 --> 09:03.161
Aw, that's cute.

09:03.162 --> 09:06.465
"Stop polluting. No more motor vehicles.

09:06.466 --> 09:09.000
And more hot, wet goat cooter"?

09:09.001 --> 09:10.268
Hell, yeah!

09:10.269 --> 09:12.991
I mean, how did that get on there?

09:12.992 --> 09:14.406
I mean, baa.

09:14.407 --> 09:17.909
Malloy, that is a bunch of
adorable, time-wasting nonsense.

09:17.910 --> 09:19.744
- Anything else?
- Yes.

09:19.745 --> 09:22.413
Turn over the ranger
who killed my parents.

09:22.414 --> 09:24.782
A ranger killed your parents?

09:24.783 --> 09:25.883
Impossible!

09:25.884 --> 09:27.618
No ranger could do something so cruel.

09:27.619 --> 09:28.620
Right, Steve?

09:28.621 --> 09:30.476
Steve, shut up.

09:30.477 --> 09:32.957
You sound like Adele walking
up a flight of stairs.

09:32.958 --> 09:35.026
- Sorry.
- So Woody, do we have a deal?

09:35.027 --> 09:38.329
Aw, daddy's little fuzzy
wuzzy wants to be a commie.

09:38.330 --> 09:42.867
What're you gonna do if we don't comply
with all your wittle bittie demands?

09:42.868 --> 09:43.901
Strike?

09:43.902 --> 09:46.604
How the hell do animals go on strike?

09:46.605 --> 09:51.976
Uh, yeah, I probably should have
offered to help with those signs.

09:51.977 --> 09:55.313
Hey! You! Where are you
going? You just got here.

09:55.314 --> 09:57.681
Hey, no one wants to go
to a park without animals.

09:57.682 --> 10:01.017
Yeah, it's like going to a Lakers
game and not getting gang banged

10:01.018 --> 10:03.322
by the team while my
husband pulls the car around.

10:03.323 --> 10:05.623
Yeah! What'd she say?

10:05.624 --> 10:07.225
You two!

10:07.226 --> 10:10.394
Go round us up some animals who
aren't afraid to cross a picket line.

10:10.395 --> 10:11.495
Scabs?

10:11.496 --> 10:13.564
You want us to get you scab animals?

10:13.565 --> 10:17.080
Don't think of them as scabs.
Think of them as improvements.

10:17.081 --> 10:21.939
You know, like when Jar Jar kicked that
Star Wars franchise into hyperspace.

10:21.940 --> 10:25.275
Swims like a fish, talks
like a slave. It's brilliant!

10:25.276 --> 10:26.810
How did George come up with that?

10:26.811 --> 10:30.291
Oh, he's a [Bleep] genius.

10:32.249 --> 10:34.283
Oops. My bad.

10:34.284 --> 10:38.820
- I didn't mean to kill an animal.
- It's okay. Fish are assholes.

10:38.821 --> 10:40.622
You are learning well, young cub.

10:40.623 --> 10:44.124
And for that, I want to give you a gift.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.926
Awesome. Lay it on me, Naz.

10:45.927 --> 10:47.994
Oh, what is happening right now?

10:47.995 --> 10:49.396
You gotta be kidding me!

10:49.397 --> 10:52.531
Moose Nazir has never let
another animal sniff his butt.

10:52.532 --> 10:54.833
Do you have any idea
what a big honor this is?

10:54.834 --> 10:58.003
- No?
- You ungrateful bastard.

10:58.004 --> 11:00.338
Let me get in there,
boss. I'll sniff you good.

11:00.339 --> 11:02.954
I'll get in so deep, you'll be
shittin' boogers for a month.

11:02.955 --> 11:04.041
No, Joe Wolf.

11:04.042 --> 11:09.082
This honor is reserved
for the son I never had.

11:12.216 --> 11:14.784
I'm an animal. This is what animals do.

11:14.785 --> 11:17.019
Just do it.

11:17.020 --> 11:19.421
Oh... what an honor.

11:19.422 --> 11:21.156
Oh.

11:21.157 --> 11:22.590
Oh, you like it? Please.

11:22.591 --> 11:26.071
Grab a sniff for the road.

11:26.662 --> 11:29.230
Scab animals? Has Woody
lost his goddamn mind?

11:29.231 --> 11:33.567
Yes, but this is an opportunity to
help neglected and abused animals.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.769
We can give them the life they deserve.

11:35.770 --> 11:37.437
Like this hungry little kitty.

11:37.438 --> 11:39.838
Ow! Bastard!

11:45.645 --> 11:48.547
Look at that man just abusing his dog.

11:48.548 --> 11:51.868
Making him wear an
Arizona Cardinals jersey.

11:51.869 --> 11:54.285
Excuse me, Sir. Would you
happen to have the time?

11:54.286 --> 11:56.554
- Why, yes, it's...
- Your dog's a frozen turkey.

11:56.555 --> 11:57.689
Oh, my God!

11:57.690 --> 12:01.650
Then what did I put in the oven?

12:02.628 --> 12:04.061
What's all this?

12:04.062 --> 12:07.431
I'm going through all the old park's
security footage to prove our innocence.

12:07.432 --> 12:09.908
Well, good luck making your way
through countless hours of...

12:09.909 --> 12:11.096
Hey, look at this.

12:11.097 --> 12:14.070
It's a tape from the same day
Malloy ended up on our doorstep.

12:14.071 --> 12:15.887
Wow, Steve.

12:15.888 --> 12:17.739
You sound like Adele going down on me.

12:17.740 --> 12:19.074
Is everything okay?

12:19.075 --> 12:20.708
No. No, it's not.

12:20.709 --> 12:23.277
The jig is up, Connie. There's
something I need to admit.

12:23.278 --> 12:26.483
Jar Jar Binks, what are
you doing in my room?

12:26.484 --> 12:29.916
Meesa like. Meesa like you.

12:29.917 --> 12:33.019
Oh Jar Jar, what are you
doing? Jar Jar, this is crazy!

12:33.020 --> 12:34.780
Stop. Stop. Don't stop.

12:34.781 --> 12:36.422
Don't... oh. Ah.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.423
Oh, that feels good.

12:39.632 --> 12:40.726
Jesus Christ!

12:40.727 --> 12:42.613
When I said "scab animals,"

12:42.614 --> 12:44.796
I didn't mean animals with scabs on 'em!

12:44.797 --> 12:47.198
Does that cat have feline AIDS?

12:47.199 --> 12:49.354
Nah, just regular AIDS.

12:49.355 --> 12:51.076
Well, there's nothing
wrong with the poodle.

12:51.077 --> 12:54.497
He's over there picketing!

12:55.039 --> 12:58.154
This is a disaster! The
tourists are all gone!

12:58.155 --> 12:59.516
The strike is working.

12:59.517 --> 13:03.146
Soon, they'll give into our demands and
turn over the prick who killed my parents.

13:03.147 --> 13:05.581
Patience, my son.

13:05.582 --> 13:09.251
The strike was just a device to get
the Rangers alone and vulnerable.

13:09.252 --> 13:12.554
It's time for phase two.

13:12.555 --> 13:13.755
Make them smell your ass?

13:13.756 --> 13:17.296
No. Kill them. All of them!

13:17.975 --> 13:19.494
You know what will help that cough?

13:19.495 --> 13:21.495
A quick butt sniff.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.353
What the [Bleep], Joe Wolf?

13:23.354 --> 13:24.798
You trying to sneak a sniff?

13:24.799 --> 13:27.933
No, boss. I just lost my car keys.

13:27.934 --> 13:31.954
I thought I saw 'em in your butt.

13:34.219 --> 13:36.154
All right, Ethel. We tried it your way.

13:36.155 --> 13:38.156
Now we're gonna try it my way.

13:38.157 --> 13:40.234
Give me 100 unmarked,
non-consecutive puppies.

13:40.235 --> 13:46.135
And don't try to give me the ones with
the dye packs, I'm onto you, mother[Bleep]!

13:46.665 --> 13:49.534
Wow, crime does pay.
You think we have enough?

13:49.535 --> 13:55.435
We should. We knocked over 2 zoos,
12 pet stores, and a Chuck E. Cheese.

13:57.510 --> 14:00.690
Goddamn puppy dye pack!

14:03.283 --> 14:08.253
We will kill the humans, you will have
your revenge, but we won't stop there.

14:08.254 --> 14:12.358
We will punish any animal who
associates with human things.

14:12.359 --> 14:13.759
Ah, Neil.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.395
How are you, my friend?

14:15.396 --> 14:17.397
Just chillin' like a motherbucker.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.832
What's up with you, Moose N?

14:18.833 --> 14:22.068
You haven't been enjoying
any human food, have you?

14:22.069 --> 14:24.838
Maybe rooting around in the trash can?

14:24.839 --> 14:27.040
You know this is against our rules.

14:27.041 --> 14:29.108
No way. I hate human food.

14:29.109 --> 14:30.505
- Ah, shit!
- Kill him.

14:30.506 --> 14:32.412
Oh, no! Oh! Oh, it hurts!

14:32.413 --> 14:34.680
Whoa, I did not realize
you guys were this intense.

14:34.681 --> 14:38.434
That's right. I even ordered the
tiger hit on Siegfried and Roy.

14:38.435 --> 14:43.055
Wow. I thought that tiger just
hated magicians like everyone else.

14:43.056 --> 14:46.100
I cannot believe they killed
Neil for eating a doughnut.

14:46.101 --> 14:48.560
I just need to calm down, relax.

14:48.561 --> 14:50.195
No more human stuff.

14:50.196 --> 14:52.631
Right after I beat Gears of War...

14:52.632 --> 14:54.467
And eat a king-sized Snicker bar...

14:54.468 --> 14:56.302
And this buffalo chicken pizza...

14:56.303 --> 15:01.006
And get a happy ending
from this Filipino hooker.

15:01.007 --> 15:04.377
Looks like someone's
sniffed his last Moose ass.

15:04.378 --> 15:06.298
Nice.

15:09.983 --> 15:14.063
"The key to being a safe driver"...

15:15.048 --> 15:17.991
Oh, my God! Wait.
You're both still alive.

15:17.992 --> 15:21.232
I'll go call for help.

15:23.999 --> 15:25.432
Aah!

15:25.433 --> 15:28.502
Ugh, I can't keep living like this.

15:28.503 --> 15:34.383
I'm gonna do something I should
have done a long time ago.

15:36.243 --> 15:37.487
Connie, wake up.

15:37.488 --> 15:39.348
Aah!

15:39.882 --> 15:41.547
Ugh!

15:41.548 --> 15:44.083
Sorry. What's going on, Steve?

15:44.084 --> 15:45.760
There's something I need to show you.

15:45.761 --> 15:50.094
Steve, that's so sweet, but this is
something I've never told anyone before.

15:50.095 --> 15:53.626
I'm gay. Oh, my God. It feels
so good to finally say it.

15:53.627 --> 15:55.528
What a burden lifted.

15:55.529 --> 15:59.789
That's not why I'm here. It's this.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.501
Look at me. I'm Connie.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.735
I'm driving.

16:02.736 --> 16:04.837
Oops! I hit something.

16:04.838 --> 16:07.239
Dum dee dum dum dum dum.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.154
Bang! Shot Malloy's parents.

16:09.155 --> 16:10.409
I'm so stupid.

16:10.410 --> 16:13.178
Oh, no. It was me.

16:13.179 --> 16:14.947
I killed Malloy's parents.

16:14.948 --> 16:17.250
I need to confess to him right now!

16:17.251 --> 16:18.985
But those animals might kill you.

16:18.986 --> 16:20.687
It's what I deserve.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.062
Unless there's some
other piece of information

16:23.063 --> 16:25.091
that could clear my
name and save my life.

16:25.092 --> 16:28.692
Hmm, not that I'm aware of.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.431
What have I done?

16:32.432 --> 16:34.533
They're gonna kill Connie.

16:34.534 --> 16:37.845
Screw that fat bitch. Who
cares if they kill her?

16:37.846 --> 16:39.024
What about you?

16:39.025 --> 16:41.073
Hello? Is anyone there?

16:41.074 --> 16:45.403
I don't know, man. Just do what he said.

16:45.404 --> 16:47.264
What up, my brethren?

16:47.265 --> 16:50.816
I can't believe you
would hurt me like this.

16:50.817 --> 16:53.518
Uh oh. Somebody's in trouble.

16:53.519 --> 16:56.221
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

16:56.222 --> 17:01.126
So you didn't spend all day on your
boxed "X" playing queers of whore?

17:01.127 --> 17:03.228
I can honestly say no to that.

17:03.229 --> 17:05.964
And to think I opened my anus to you.

17:05.965 --> 17:09.068
I'm sorry, Moose Nazir. Please,
it will never happen again.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.439
Attention, animals.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.638
- I am...
- A bloated, ginger she beast!

17:13.640 --> 17:15.775
But also completely innocent.

17:15.776 --> 17:17.592
That first part was kind of mean.

17:17.593 --> 17:21.258
No, Connie, it was honesty, and
that's what we need right now.

17:21.259 --> 17:23.116
Malloy, I did it.

17:23.117 --> 17:24.664
I killed your parents.

17:24.665 --> 17:26.425
I should have known.

17:26.425 --> 17:28.287
You're dead, Steve.

17:28.288 --> 17:30.556
Good. Redeem yourself.

17:30.557 --> 17:33.860
Allow your animal
instincts to take control.

17:33.861 --> 17:36.429
Eat his face off.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.097
I'm sorry.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.333
It just sounded like you
said, "eat his face off".

17:40.334 --> 17:42.369
- I did.
- I'm sorry.

17:42.370 --> 17:44.748
It just sounded like you said, "I did".

17:44.749 --> 17:47.227
What? Wait, wait, wait. This is crazy.

17:47.228 --> 17:49.909
- Did you just nod?
- Do it!

17:49.910 --> 17:54.914
Hey, this might not be the right
time, but are you Khloe Kardashian?

17:54.915 --> 17:58.816
You're nowhere near as ugly
as you are on television.

17:58.817 --> 18:00.896
And that's the whole story Malloy.

18:00.897 --> 18:02.828
You expect me to believe
that you tripped, shot

18:02.829 --> 18:05.314
two bears through the
head with one bullet?

18:05.315 --> 18:08.951
I know. Imagine how
surprised your parents were.

18:08.952 --> 18:10.838
Come on, Malloy bear. Do it.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.639
Show us you are a true animal.

18:12.640 --> 18:15.675
For once you eat his face,
you can never go back!

18:15.676 --> 18:16.943
Do it!

18:16.944 --> 18:19.446
Malloy, I deserve to be eaten alive.

18:19.447 --> 18:22.683
Here's some Arby's horsey sauce packets
that I think would go great with my face.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.852
Do it now!

18:24.853 --> 18:26.520
Uh, uh...

18:26.521 --> 18:28.278
Uh, ah...

18:28.279 --> 18:29.790
Uh...

18:29.791 --> 18:31.592
Ugh, I can't eat his face.

18:31.593 --> 18:34.194
You sure I should eat him
raw? Can't I get salmonella?

18:34.195 --> 18:36.563
Proof you are a human lover!

18:36.564 --> 18:38.532
So what if I am? I like my life.

18:38.533 --> 18:39.867
I belong with the humans.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.937
And if that bothers you, I guess
you'll just have to kill all of us.

18:42.938 --> 18:44.739
All right. Let's kill all of them.

18:44.740 --> 18:47.141
Ooh, I suck at ultimatums.

18:47.142 --> 18:49.010
Look! Johnny Depp!

18:49.011 --> 18:52.551
Where? Where is Johnny Depp?

18:53.315 --> 18:55.983
Connie, do something!

18:55.984 --> 18:57.904
Here.

18:58.074 --> 18:59.298
What should we do now?

18:59.299 --> 19:04.399
Let's start with Connie
putting a shirt back on.

19:08.831 --> 19:11.166
Where the hell did all
those stupid animals go?

19:11.167 --> 19:12.868
Hey, I'm ready to negotiate!

19:12.869 --> 19:16.889
- Here they are!
- Where? Aah! Ow!

19:18.169 --> 19:20.842
Now, my little furry friend.

19:20.843 --> 19:23.945
This is how you eat a face.

19:23.946 --> 19:25.866
Ah...

19:26.314 --> 19:30.751
Stop! I didn't want it to come to
this, but you've left me with no choice.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.692
Attack, my children!

19:34.856 --> 19:36.857
Ow! Ah! No, no, them!

19:36.858 --> 19:40.038
Aah! Them! Attack them!

19:54.348 --> 19:56.988
Ha! You missed!

19:57.539 --> 20:01.259
You had a gun the whole time?

20:05.119 --> 20:06.386
Well, I gotta say, Ethel.

20:06.387 --> 20:09.590
You do put on a better Earth
Day celebration than me.

20:09.591 --> 20:11.898
I hope we all learned
a valuable lesson...

20:11.899 --> 20:15.363
That everyone needs to respect
nature and be nicer to animals.

20:15.364 --> 20:21.064
Or, when you do kill an
animal, replace it with a robot.

20:25.174 --> 20:27.542
Well, it's that day again, Malloy.

20:27.543 --> 20:29.644
I wanted to say I'm
sorry for what I did.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.413
Ah, don't worry about it, Steve.

20:31.414 --> 20:33.205
After all, if you
didn't kill my parents,

20:33.206 --> 20:36.217
I wouldn't be watching bum fights,
eating this microwave corn dog right now.

20:36.218 --> 20:37.819
Animals don't know what they're missing.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.156
Well, I guess I did you a favor, huh?

20:40.157 --> 20:45.227
Sure. And as a thank
you, I got you a surprise.

20:45.228 --> 20:47.448
Mom? Dad?

20:48.164 --> 20:49.932
And now we're even.
