WEBVTT

00:00.134 --> 00:01.199
I love you, Polly Marks.

00:01.201 --> 00:03.401
I used your eye
to get out of date with Ken.

00:03.403 --> 00:04.959
Everything's gonna be fine, Jenn.

00:04.961 --> 00:06.951
Brienne stopped asking for black daddy.

00:06.953 --> 00:08.336
You know Pop and Clay had a beef?

00:09.448 --> 00:10.461
You kill my dad?

00:10.463 --> 00:12.036
- What about the salon?
- Sorry, Desna.

00:12.038 --> 00:13.890
Zlata's assets will be seized.

00:13.892 --> 00:14.959
The salon is ours now.

00:14.961 --> 00:16.271
I'm Mac Lovestone.

00:16.274 --> 00:18.147
And this is my wife, Melba.

00:18.149 --> 00:19.484
We were your husband's partners.

00:19.486 --> 00:20.897
We'd just like to give you back

00:20.899 --> 00:22.452
Greg's stake in the casino.

00:22.454 --> 00:23.555
$50,000?

00:23.557 --> 00:24.957
Y'all don't know Mac and Melba.

00:24.959 --> 00:26.425
Y'all in bed with the devil.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.761
I cut that check for you.
Boy, you got robbed.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.362
I say just take the money and run.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.830
They ain't getting rid of me this easy.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.299
I'm done being disrespected by everyone.

00:34.301 --> 00:37.770
If we play this hand right,
we can all level up.

00:37.772 --> 00:39.237
Let's secure this bag.

00:39.239 --> 00:42.107
Brrrr, whoo!

00:44.111 --> 00:45.978
- We killed it, y'all.
- Hell yeah.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.781
- Getting our shop back at auction.
- Yeah.

00:48.783 --> 00:50.515
Now we're back like we never left.

00:50.517 --> 00:52.317
There is no place like home.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.986
There's no place like home.

00:55.122 --> 00:57.293
Nobody can keep us out of Palmghetto.

00:57.295 --> 00:59.257
That is right, that is right.

00:59.259 --> 01:01.393
Not even the U.S. government.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.795
Come on, ladies.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.529
Let's go reclaim our shit.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.178

01:53.180 --> 01:55.614
Bye, Felicia. Bye.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.932
- Yes!
- Ooh!

01:58.934 --> 02:00.052
Alright, y'all.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.986
Is everything where everybody remembered?

02:01.988 --> 02:03.722
Yeah, girl. Still here.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.524
I missed you, Judy.

02:05.526 --> 02:06.591
- Mwah.
- Come here.

02:06.593 --> 02:07.726
- Gather around, y'all.
- What?

02:07.728 --> 02:08.902
Listen. What's up?

02:08.905 --> 02:10.863
I would not be here

02:10.865 --> 02:12.597
if it was not for y'all.

02:12.599 --> 02:15.467
And now that I'm about
to take this to the next level,

02:15.469 --> 02:17.202
I want everybody in.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.538
I don't trust that Mac and Melba one bit,

02:19.540 --> 02:23.272
so I want one of us to be
at that casino at all times.

02:23.274 --> 02:24.550
- Yeah.
- I got you, Des.

02:24.552 --> 02:26.478
- Ride or die.
- I love the movie "Casino."

02:26.480 --> 02:28.012
That's my shit.

02:28.014 --> 02:29.748
- See, this right here...
- Hell yeah.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.150
...this is all we need, is our crew.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.660
So what if we never ran a casino before?

02:34.662 --> 02:36.889
- We are bitches with passion...
- Mm-hmm.

02:36.891 --> 02:39.824
- ...we got...
- With Wikipedia.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.626
Oh, I Googled how to run a casino.

02:41.628 --> 02:42.761
Guess what? It's easy.

02:42.763 --> 02:43.896
Okay.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.409
We will divide and conquer.

02:45.411 --> 02:47.416
Split our time between here and there.

02:47.418 --> 02:51.303
Ooh-wee! I cannot wait to get
my blackjack on.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.232
Simmer down, Left Eye.

02:53.234 --> 02:55.908
Busted. We need you to stay here.

02:55.910 --> 02:59.043
The rest of y'all,
I got jobs for at Bayside.

02:59.045 --> 03:00.445

03:01.648 --> 03:02.715

Ooh! Dustier than an
old grandlady cooter in here.

03:35.596 --> 03:38.066
My clinic, on the other hand,
is pristine.

03:38.068 --> 03:40.138
I already got pillbillies lining up.

03:40.140 --> 03:44.142

You know I can't sell no pills

03:57.423 --> 04:01.025
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
I never thought I'd see the day!

04:01.027 --> 04:04.295
1K a month and it's yours.

04:04.297 --> 04:06.564
Gettin' greedy up there

04:06.566 --> 04:07.898

04:07.900 --> 04:10.869

04:15.041 --> 04:17.107
- No hard ball is gonna...
- What? Hmm?

04:17.108 --> 04:18.375
Alright, you got a deal.

04:18.378 --> 04:19.644
Let's go.

04:19.646 --> 04:20.711
Damn right I do.

04:22.113 --> 04:24.849
She's always trying to disrespect you.

04:24.851 --> 04:27.051
There he is. How you feeling?

04:27.053 --> 04:28.719
Stop acting like we cool.

04:28.721 --> 04:30.733
You really shouldn't talk to him
like that, Roller.

04:30.735 --> 04:32.456
- He loves you.
- Hey, put a muzzle on your bitch.

04:32.458 --> 04:33.591
I got it, I got it.

04:33.593 --> 04:35.726
Checked out Clint yet?

04:35.728 --> 04:37.461
I ain't seen him in a minute.

04:37.463 --> 04:40.264
Yeah, he won't be a problem no more.

04:40.266 --> 04:41.993
Are we cool, then?

04:44.036 --> 04:46.136
Till you come clean what
happened to my family, Clay,

04:46.138 --> 04:48.106
we ain't shit.

04:57.684 --> 04:59.083
Russian bitch.

05:00.220 --> 05:01.686
What you doing over here, D?

05:01.688 --> 05:03.021
This old raggedy place.

05:03.023 --> 05:05.089
You kidding me? With all the money

05:05.091 --> 05:07.025
I'ma be banking from Bayside,

05:07.027 --> 05:09.227
I'm about to franchise Nail Artisans.

05:09.229 --> 05:11.762
You wanna be doing nails
for the rest of your life, then?

05:11.764 --> 05:12.830
Come on, now, baby.

05:12.832 --> 05:14.716
Nails is in my blood.

05:14.718 --> 05:18.369
And if I wanna be Tony Soprano,
I need a legit front.

05:18.371 --> 05:19.838
Shit.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.105
I hear that.

05:21.107 --> 05:22.707
I see you bossin' up, baby.

05:22.709 --> 05:24.242
You want some more of this swamp dick?

05:24.244 --> 05:26.244
I got shit to do, Roller. Don't you?

05:26.246 --> 05:27.845
Oh, yeah, I'm doing it.

05:27.847 --> 05:29.313
Okay. Mnh-mnh, mnh-mnh.

05:29.315 --> 05:32.583
Let me see if I can find something
for you to do at the casino...

05:32.585 --> 05:34.219
besides my ass.

05:39.191 --> 05:41.259
Ooh, I'ma play me some blackjack.

05:41.261 --> 05:43.193
Y'all, this carpet is
giving me my full life.

05:43.195 --> 05:45.730
Well, tits up, here we go.

05:45.732 --> 05:48.132
Desna, what a surprise.

05:48.134 --> 05:49.734
We are here and ready to work.

05:49.736 --> 05:52.603
Work? We assumed
you'd be a silent partner,

05:52.605 --> 05:54.138
like Ruval was.

05:54.140 --> 05:55.406
I like silence.

05:55.408 --> 05:56.874
Desna don't do silent.

05:56.876 --> 05:58.342
Wow.

05:58.344 --> 06:00.411
What's going on here?

06:00.413 --> 06:03.882
Mmm. So street.

06:03.884 --> 06:05.883
- Wow.
- That's enough, Melba.

06:05.885 --> 06:07.685
Let me introduce you to Joe.

06:07.687 --> 06:10.220
He's our general manager.
Joe runs the logistics

06:10.222 --> 06:12.222
of our day-to-day here.

06:12.224 --> 06:13.891
He's my little worker bee.

06:13.893 --> 06:15.093
It's a pleasure.

06:15.095 --> 06:16.827
What an attractive group of young ladies.

06:16.829 --> 06:19.697
Well, I'd like for you all
to meet <i> my</i> general manager,

06:19.699 --> 06:20.898
Polly Marks.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.100
Yes, yes.

06:22.102 --> 06:24.168
Yes. And, uh, rest assured,

06:24.170 --> 06:25.303
I'm highly qualified.

06:25.305 --> 06:27.505
I was the manager of Treasure Island...

06:27.507 --> 06:29.350
- Maybe you've heard of that...
- in Vegas.

06:29.352 --> 06:30.975
And, uh, during my tenure,

06:30.977 --> 06:34.579
I saved not one, but two FBI agents.

06:34.581 --> 06:36.180
She served with honor.

06:36.182 --> 06:37.982
Very heroic of you.

06:37.984 --> 06:39.517
Hello, "Miss Congeniality 2."

06:39.519 --> 06:41.652
Okay, ladies, over in this corner

06:41.654 --> 06:43.788
is our VIP concierge station.

06:43.790 --> 06:46.590
This is where Melba handles
all our high-rollers.

06:46.592 --> 06:48.058
Oh, that's for me and you, girl.

06:48.060 --> 06:49.175
I prefer to work alone.

06:49.177 --> 06:50.461
Oh.

06:50.463 --> 06:52.062
What's with all the 'roided-out women?

06:52.064 --> 06:54.933
Well, we're holding
the Ms. Florida Muscles Contest

06:54.935 --> 06:56.867
- this weekend.
- That sounds like fun

06:56.869 --> 06:59.363
and a perfect job for me and Quiet Ann.

06:59.365 --> 07:00.932
We like strong women.

07:00.934 --> 07:03.474
And I think she would be great
as head of security.

07:03.476 --> 07:04.601
- Agreed.
- Thank you.

07:04.603 --> 07:06.611
But Ms. Muscles is mine.

07:06.613 --> 07:07.783
That's mine, okay?

07:07.785 --> 07:08.829
We'll see.

07:08.831 --> 07:11.482
Mmm. Joe, can you please help Desna

07:11.484 --> 07:13.417
and her friends to her office?

07:13.419 --> 07:15.153
Y'all are gonna love working with us.

07:15.155 --> 07:16.554
Let's go, Joe.

07:16.556 --> 07:18.489
I also get an office.

07:18.491 --> 07:20.491
She makes my head buzz.

07:20.493 --> 07:22.827
We can't afford to have her
sniffing around here.

07:22.829 --> 07:25.429
She's got no idea what it takes
to run this place.

07:25.431 --> 07:28.967
We'll have her so busy, she'll go
back to doing nails in no time.

07:31.571 --> 07:34.639
Everybody, take a seat
until your number is called.

07:34.641 --> 07:37.194
Damn. How they already know
about the clinic reopening?

07:37.196 --> 07:39.309
Pillbilly Twitter's even faster
than Black Twitter.

07:39.311 --> 07:41.045
I ain't understanding none of your words.

07:41.047 --> 07:42.580
You, stop that!

07:42.582 --> 07:45.115
Then I was thinking I would take
her somewhere romantic this weekend,

07:45.117 --> 07:47.986
like maybe see Art Garfunkel solo?

07:47.988 --> 07:49.720
He just does the high parts.

07:49.722 --> 07:50.739
Hey.

07:50.764 --> 07:52.390
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

07:52.392 --> 07:53.391
- Flag on the play.
- Wait.

07:53.393 --> 07:54.792
No, Ken. Wha...

07:54.794 --> 07:58.027
You've sent 10 texts to Polly
without a response?

07:58.029 --> 07:59.597
Well, I mean, she's my girl.

07:59.599 --> 08:00.822
No, trust me.

08:00.824 --> 08:03.534
You gotta run the opposite polarity, huh?

08:03.536 --> 08:05.670
I got a chapter on
human magnetics in my e-book.

08:05.672 --> 08:07.071
It is a proven fact

08:07.073 --> 08:09.273
that humans are repelled
by excessive thirst.

08:09.275 --> 08:10.408
Right. Play it cool.

08:10.410 --> 08:11.475
Play it cool.

08:11.477 --> 08:12.743
Ken, the crazies are feigning.

08:12.745 --> 08:14.212
- I need help.
- Okay. Thanks.

08:14.214 --> 08:16.214
You got it. Cool as a cucumber.

08:16.216 --> 08:17.682
Well, hey, boy.

08:17.684 --> 08:19.417
You here to get back
in the family business?

08:19.419 --> 08:22.431
Well, Tampa bit ass, Uncle Daddy.

08:22.433 --> 08:24.488
I-I just figured I'd maybe do
some runs around here

08:24.490 --> 08:25.956
till I get back on my feet.

08:25.958 --> 08:28.559
Or maybe I'll give you a job
at the rehab clinic.

08:28.561 --> 08:31.937
You know, put all that
abundance stuff you do to work.

08:31.939 --> 08:34.034
I could pep talk those pillheads.

08:34.037 --> 08:36.034
Anything to get you
back in the fold, son.

08:36.035 --> 08:37.967
Besides, we can bill Medicaid

08:37.970 --> 08:41.304
for an extra $1,000 a pop for "therapy."

08:41.307 --> 08:42.599
You know what I'm sayin'?

08:42.601 --> 08:44.107
We hook 'em here, we heal 'em there.

08:44.110 --> 08:45.655
- Circle of life.
- Circle of life.

08:45.657 --> 08:47.045
Circle of money.

08:47.047 --> 08:48.178
All right, boy.

08:53.986 --> 08:57.588
It's so nice having
another security guard here.

08:57.590 --> 08:59.657
I never have anyone to talk to.

08:59.659 --> 09:00.731
Mm.

09:04.797 --> 09:06.097
This is it.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.229
These cover the casino floor...

09:09.231 --> 09:11.901
- Mm-hmm.
- ...bar, front desk, VIP,

09:11.903 --> 09:15.025
housekeeping, security, restaurant, club,

09:15.027 --> 09:17.304
- parking lot, admin...
- Okay, well, hold... Whoa, whoa.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.009
You going fast. Let me write that down.

09:20.212 --> 09:21.300
Good luck.

09:21.302 --> 09:22.947
What? I was just get...

09:25.752 --> 09:26.751
Hello?

09:26.753 --> 09:29.019
Shady Mormons on the casino floor.

09:29.021 --> 09:31.021
Shit.

09:35.895 --> 09:39.830
Desna? Tallahassee Pete is back
at blackjack table 14.

09:39.832 --> 09:41.231
I'm the new co-owner.

09:41.233 --> 09:42.300
That's not my problem.

09:42.302 --> 09:43.558
Mac and Melba said to come to you.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.769
It's a part of the gig.

09:44.771 --> 09:47.037
Okay. I'll... I'll be right there.

09:47.039 --> 09:48.172
No, you need to come now.

09:48.174 --> 09:49.507
That Soul Patch Pete's raking it in.

09:49.509 --> 09:52.176
I said I'll be right there.

09:52.178 --> 09:55.113
<i> Desna Simms to the casino floor.</i>

09:57.183 --> 10:00.385
<i>Desna Simms, please report
to the casino floor.</i>

10:06.492 --> 10:07.759
Over there.

10:07.761 --> 10:08.826
Shady, right?

10:08.828 --> 10:09.693
Mmm.

10:09.695 --> 10:11.295
Card counter's over there.

10:11.297 --> 10:13.431
Get...

10:13.433 --> 10:15.366
- Please, go.
- Yeah.

10:18.438 --> 10:20.564
Hello. I'm Desna Simms,

10:20.566 --> 10:22.373
the new co-owner of the casino.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.308
And you gentlemen are...?

10:24.310 --> 10:26.978
You <i> do</i> like to interfere.

10:26.980 --> 10:27.979
Nosey little Desna.

10:27.981 --> 10:30.181
- Bitch!
- Aah!

10:30.183 --> 10:33.517
Shit.

10:33.519 --> 10:35.052
Beat it.

10:37.323 --> 10:38.856
Hey!

10:38.858 --> 10:40.257
What is going on?!

10:40.259 --> 10:41.325
She attacked me!

10:41.327 --> 10:43.727
She called me "deaf
bitch," so I punched her!

10:43.729 --> 10:45.062
Carl, hold my hearing aid.

10:45.064 --> 10:47.131
Both of y'all bitches knock it off!

10:47.133 --> 10:48.466
Stop it!

10:48.468 --> 10:49.733
What, Virginia?!

10:49.735 --> 10:51.869
Des, I-I can't turn the alarm off!

10:51.871 --> 10:53.605
Ladies, I'm so sorry! Next one's on us.

10:53.607 --> 10:55.406
I promise, I promise!
What's... What's the code?!

10:55.408 --> 10:57.408
Ah, shit. 1-2-3-4.

10:57.410 --> 10:58.876
It's the simplest code in the world.

10:58.878 --> 11:00.812
- Stop it!
- I'm trying to!

11:00.814 --> 11:02.880
Ann?! Ann, where are you?

11:02.882 --> 11:04.015
It's not working!

11:04.017 --> 11:05.883
Virginia, I can't do this
with you right now.

11:05.885 --> 11:07.485
Tell her to get here now! It's too loud!

11:07.487 --> 11:09.353
It's... It's too loud, Virginia!

11:09.355 --> 11:11.222
I'll be there as soon as I can!

11:11.224 --> 11:14.025
Will y'all... Ann,
come break these bitches up!

11:16.830 --> 11:18.029
I can't.

11:18.031 --> 11:20.031
I... can't.

11:20.033 --> 11:21.232
Too much noise!

11:21.234 --> 11:23.346
- It's too much noise!
- I... I know. It's...

11:23.348 --> 11:24.702
Sir, I need you to calm down.

11:24.704 --> 11:26.504
- Calm down.
- Don't you touch me!

11:26.506 --> 11:28.306
Y-You shoot black people!

11:28.308 --> 11:29.773
My partner is black.

11:29.775 --> 11:31.309
That's gotta count for something.

11:31.311 --> 11:32.945
- Virginia?
- Breathe.

11:32.947 --> 11:34.578
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here!

11:34.580 --> 11:35.913
Turn it off!

11:35.915 --> 11:38.316
'Cause it's too loud, Des!

11:38.318 --> 11:39.583
Okay.

11:39.585 --> 11:40.963
Uhh! Thank you, Jesus!

11:40.965 --> 11:42.562
Officer, I am so sorry.

11:42.564 --> 11:45.122
I-I... I'm his sister,
and I... I own the shop.

11:45.124 --> 11:46.123
I'll take it from here.

11:46.125 --> 11:47.325
Yeah, I'll send you a bill.

11:47.327 --> 11:48.860
Wow.

11:48.862 --> 11:50.794
Hey, hey. They could've shot us, Dessie.

11:50.796 --> 11:51.996
They could've shot us.
That's what they do.

11:51.998 --> 11:53.197
They shoot people.

11:53.199 --> 11:54.532
- Deanie?
- They shoot... Dessie, they sh...

11:54.534 --> 11:56.133
Deanie? Look at me.

11:56.135 --> 11:58.269
Okay? I'm not gonna let
nothing happen to you.

11:58.271 --> 11:59.671
I'm here now. Okay?

11:59.673 --> 12:01.523
Okay, wait, what did you do different?

12:01.525 --> 12:04.676
I pressed "1-2-3-4, Off,"
Virginia, like I told you.

12:04.678 --> 12:06.988
- You didn't tell me "Off."
- Oh, my God!

12:06.990 --> 12:09.613
I didn't think I needed to
say "Off," Short Bus.

12:09.615 --> 12:10.882
That... That's insensitive, Des.

12:10.884 --> 12:12.416
And... And you could've
written the code down

12:12.418 --> 12:14.085
so other people could ac-access it.

12:14.087 --> 12:17.621
Yeah, I'ma add <i> that</i> on my list
of things to do.

12:17.623 --> 12:19.557
- Mm-hmm.
- Shut up, Virginia,

12:19.559 --> 12:21.559
before I hit you in your other eye.

12:22.696 --> 12:24.762
Right there!

12:24.764 --> 12:26.830
Just leave it!

12:26.832 --> 12:27.882
Jenn?

12:32.972 --> 12:34.372
EJ.

12:34.374 --> 12:35.907
When'd you get out?

12:35.909 --> 12:36.908
Yesterday.

12:36.910 --> 12:37.975
Huh.

12:37.977 --> 12:39.553
Paroled early.

12:40.914 --> 12:43.247
I'm guessing you're not here
for a manicure?

12:43.249 --> 12:45.316
Nah.

12:45.318 --> 12:47.725
- How's our baby girl?
- She's thrivin'.

12:47.727 --> 12:49.211
You know, I really would like to see her.

12:49.213 --> 12:52.924
Mm-hmm, well, I'm not gonna
do this right now, so...

12:52.926 --> 12:55.192
Come on, Jenn.
She needs to see her father.

12:55.194 --> 12:56.260
Well, I'll call you!

12:56.262 --> 12:57.996
- Jenn!
- I promise!

13:00.800 --> 13:02.333
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey, girl.

13:02.335 --> 13:03.534
Hey, Jennifer.

13:03.536 --> 13:04.868
- Baby?
- Yeah?

13:04.870 --> 13:06.433
Are you feeling a little better?

13:06.435 --> 13:10.274
No, I'm concerned that the alarm
gave me tinnitus.

13:10.276 --> 13:12.744
Hey, Virginia. Uh, I meant
to give you props earlier.

13:12.746 --> 13:14.612
You're... You're really rocking
that eye patch, girl.

13:14.614 --> 13:16.680
- Thank you, boo.
- Do you need anything?

13:16.682 --> 13:18.215
Maybe some... some chicken soup?

13:18.217 --> 13:20.084
'Cause I can order some
on Postmates for you, if you...

13:20.086 --> 13:22.153
Hot foods? Girl, do you know me?

13:22.155 --> 13:23.621
Yeah.

13:23.623 --> 13:25.412
T-Toby, if you really wanna be
of assistance,

13:25.414 --> 13:28.159
you can help me find the animal
that shot my fiancée.

13:28.161 --> 13:30.094
Maybe after my mani.

13:30.096 --> 13:31.495
- Baby, listen.
- Yeah?

13:31.497 --> 13:32.896
You gotta stop.

13:32.898 --> 13:34.231
Right, I'm gonna set up
another appointment

13:34.233 --> 13:36.700
with Dr. Ken if you keep
having revenge fantasies.

13:36.702 --> 13:39.036
But Dr. Ken's not qualified.
We both know that.

13:39.038 --> 13:40.704
Des, it's just a fantasy.

13:40.706 --> 13:42.306
Everybody got revenge fantasies.

13:42.308 --> 13:44.575
I had a revenge fantasy about
my mama on the way to work.

13:44.577 --> 13:46.377
Do not listen to her, okay?

13:46.379 --> 13:48.049
- Hey, hey. Look at me.
- Yeah?

13:48.051 --> 13:50.581
- Yeah.
- Nobody is coming after us.

13:50.583 --> 13:52.716
- You got it?
- Yeah.

13:52.718 --> 13:53.785
Don't worry, Des.

13:53.787 --> 13:55.787
I'll keep him busy.

13:56.296 --> 13:59.123
She... She's talking about intercourse.

13:59.466 --> 14:01.993
Listen. I want you to stop
talking about killing people.

14:01.995 --> 14:03.661
Just find a new interest.

14:03.663 --> 14:05.929
Then sex it is.

14:05.931 --> 14:07.331
Whatever works.

14:26.486 --> 14:27.751
Polly?

14:27.753 --> 14:28.752
What are you doing in my office?

14:28.754 --> 14:29.953
Oh, hey, man.

14:29.955 --> 14:31.889
Um, I think you mean <i>our</i> office.

14:31.891 --> 14:33.100
We can find somewhere else for you.

14:33.102 --> 14:34.358
No, no, no, that's okay.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.694
As Bayside Rapture's
new co-general manager,

14:36.696 --> 14:39.363
I'm precisely where I need to be.

14:39.365 --> 14:42.274
Actually, if you're gonna be
the new co-general manager...

14:42.276 --> 14:43.280
Mm-hmm?

14:43.305 --> 14:45.369
...I need you to time-check
all the employees.

14:45.371 --> 14:47.711
Make sure no one's getting
more than 20 hours a week.

14:47.713 --> 14:48.740
Copy that.

14:48.765 --> 14:50.298
Yeah, we don't wanna
have to pay health care.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.776
Wow. You must really hate
working for these cheap-skates.

14:52.778 --> 14:54.789
I owe Mac and Melba my life.

14:54.791 --> 14:58.650
They took me in when I was just
a kid doing petty crimes.

14:58.652 --> 14:59.984
What kind of crimes?

14:59.986 --> 15:02.520
Armed robbery, aggravated assault, arson.

15:02.522 --> 15:03.787
Those are, uh...

15:03.789 --> 15:05.723
Those are felony offenses.

15:05.725 --> 15:07.991
Do you wanna maybe go offline

15:07.993 --> 15:09.727
and unpack that a little bit more?

15:11.464 --> 15:12.930
Shrimp better be deveined.

15:12.932 --> 15:14.732
Last thing I need in my life
is more shit.

15:14.734 --> 15:16.467
Ooh! Damn, Clay.

15:16.469 --> 15:18.295
<i>I'm</i> the blind one.

15:19.072 --> 15:20.404
What's going on with you?

15:20.406 --> 15:21.673
Nothin'.

15:21.675 --> 15:23.407
Just, uh, dealing with some pillbillies

15:23.409 --> 15:24.742
up at the clinic.

15:26.178 --> 15:28.279
Something else is bothering you.

15:30.950 --> 15:32.976
Whatever it is,

15:33.953 --> 15:35.615
you need to forgive yourself for it.

15:35.617 --> 15:37.021
Why don't you mind your own business?

15:37.023 --> 15:39.691
There's something weighing on you.

15:39.693 --> 15:41.425
You need to let it go.

15:47.433 --> 15:49.633
How do you know?

15:49.635 --> 15:51.578
I know it's time.

15:52.505 --> 15:54.238
Time to let it all go.

16:02.648 --> 16:04.782
I can't bear it.

16:04.784 --> 16:07.118
I can't bear it any longer.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.134
Let it out.

16:08.136 --> 16:09.988
Mm-hmm.

16:13.526 --> 16:15.059
Let it all out.

16:17.663 --> 16:19.463
I know what I gotta do.

16:19.465 --> 16:20.774
Mm-hmm.

16:21.535 --> 16:24.056
I gotta talk to my baby boy.

16:24.058 --> 16:25.209
Yeah.

16:27.773 --> 16:29.873
Y'all slackin'
or y'all cleanin' around here?

16:30.070 --> 16:31.670
You know I like my place on point.

16:31.672 --> 16:33.071
Girl, we've been a little bit slammed

16:33.073 --> 16:34.206
trying to deal with your clients.

16:34.208 --> 16:36.208
- Virginia, get a broom.
- Why I gotta do it?

16:36.210 --> 16:37.343
'Cause I said so.

16:39.680 --> 16:40.947
I got your text.

16:40.949 --> 16:42.281
Figured it'd be safer to talk here.

16:42.283 --> 16:44.751
Who were those Mormon freaks
at the casino

16:44.753 --> 16:46.218
in that picture I sent you?

16:46.220 --> 16:47.820
They deliver money to Mac and Melba.

16:47.822 --> 16:50.289
It gets laundered in some
secret account called "Trip."

16:50.291 --> 16:52.090
It's a shit-ton of cash.

16:52.092 --> 16:53.626
And let me guess...

16:53.628 --> 16:56.059
They don't plan on cutting me in?

17:00.734 --> 17:02.468
So, here's the tea.

17:02.470 --> 17:05.002
Yolanda said that those freaks
got us running

17:05.005 --> 17:06.672
all around on some extra shit,

17:06.674 --> 17:09.208
trying to keep us out
of what's really going on.

17:09.210 --> 17:12.478
They're dumping millions into
a secret account called "Trip."

17:12.480 --> 17:15.948
This Trip shit is just like
Zlata all over again.

17:15.950 --> 17:17.950
They asses is up to somethin'.

17:17.952 --> 17:19.551
Just confront Mac and Melba.

17:19.554 --> 17:21.220
Maybe they'll respect that.

17:21.222 --> 17:22.354
It's the code of the streets.

17:22.356 --> 17:24.823
I don't know. What you think?

17:24.825 --> 17:27.425
EJ got out of prison,
and now he wants to see Brienne.

17:27.428 --> 17:29.962
- I know you lyin'.
- I know.

17:29.964 --> 17:31.230
Well, what does Bryce think?

17:31.232 --> 17:32.631
What does <i> Brienne</i> think?

17:32.633 --> 17:34.366
She don't think nothing,
'cause she has never met him

17:34.368 --> 17:35.501
and she does not know that man

17:35.503 --> 17:37.103
and she did not ask about him

17:37.105 --> 17:38.637
and Bryce is the only daddy
that she knows.

17:38.639 --> 17:40.306
I just got my marriage
and my life back on track,

17:40.308 --> 17:41.974
and drama is the last thing
that I need, so...

17:41.976 --> 17:43.175
What are you afraid of?

17:43.177 --> 17:44.608
I'm not afraid of nothin'.

17:45.446 --> 17:47.027
Shit.

17:49.049 --> 17:50.447
I'm afraid that...

17:51.452 --> 17:53.786
as a white chick with a black daughter,

17:53.788 --> 17:56.589
that I'm not giving her what she needs.

17:56.591 --> 17:59.325
And then she will meet EJ and his family

17:59.327 --> 18:01.527
and she'll realize that white
chocolate doesn't cut it...

18:01.529 --> 18:03.129
- Oh, honey.
- Oh, no, no, no.

18:03.131 --> 18:05.731
...and she'll wanna be
with them, probably.

18:05.733 --> 18:07.800
You're making me feel bad
for white people now.

18:07.802 --> 18:09.868
Ann.

18:09.870 --> 18:11.203
Just be open.

18:11.205 --> 18:13.806
Meet up with EJ and get it all out.

18:13.808 --> 18:15.474
Cap'n Crunch is right.

18:15.476 --> 18:17.410
Meet up with the man, confront him.

18:17.412 --> 18:19.478
That's what I'ma do with Mac and Melba.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.880
We gonna get to the bottom of this shit.

18:21.882 --> 18:23.015
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:23.017 --> 18:24.683
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:24.685 --> 18:26.152
Thanks for the advice, Jack Sparrow.

18:26.154 --> 18:27.620
You're welcome, girl.

18:28.889 --> 18:30.757
Let's go, Brycey.

18:31.343 --> 18:32.616
No, no, no, no. I'm not doing this shit.

18:32.618 --> 18:33.833
Roller, wait, wait.

18:33.835 --> 18:35.027
I'm not doing this.
I'm not doing this shit!

18:35.029 --> 18:36.562
- Wait, wait, just hold on.
- Just give him a minute!

18:36.564 --> 18:38.164
One minute, come on. Just come in here.

18:38.166 --> 18:40.038
Listen, I'm not doing this shit.

18:41.369 --> 18:43.125
I'm not here for trouble.

18:44.438 --> 18:46.038
I got something to say.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.573
You were right, son.

18:47.575 --> 18:49.842
I didn't tell you the truth
about how your folks died.

18:49.844 --> 18:52.511
- Piece of shit. He's a piece of shit.
- Roller, I...

18:52.513 --> 18:54.446
Roller, listen, come on.
Just give the man a...

18:54.448 --> 18:55.581
just give him a minute, all right?

18:55.583 --> 18:57.116
Look, I got the chair and the table.

18:57.118 --> 18:58.418
Sit down, man.

19:02.923 --> 19:05.858
Y'all know your daddy
was a first-rate gangster,

19:05.860 --> 19:12.331
but as a man, he was 100% son-of-a-bitch.

19:12.333 --> 19:13.732
He'd get to drinking

19:13.734 --> 19:15.802
and be beating on y'all and your mama.

19:15.804 --> 19:18.136
Everybody knew what Clyde was doin'.

19:18.138 --> 19:20.272
Hell,<i> I</i> knew.

19:20.274 --> 19:21.830
Every other day,

19:22.543 --> 19:24.624
your mama would come to me

19:25.279 --> 19:29.816
bruised, scared, asking for my help.

19:29.818 --> 19:32.485
But here's the thing
you gotta understand, boys,

19:32.487 --> 19:34.086
and it's really important.

19:34.088 --> 19:38.388
Back then, how a man ran
his family was his own business.

19:39.427 --> 19:41.360
So I stayed out of it.

19:41.362 --> 19:42.895
On the day your mama died,

19:42.897 --> 19:45.364
she showed up to my door with you boys.

19:45.366 --> 19:46.938
I wouldn't listen.

19:48.102 --> 19:50.442
I drove y'all back over to him.

19:51.572 --> 19:53.606
And later that day...

19:56.110 --> 19:59.345
...when I found out
he beat her to death...

20:04.452 --> 20:06.917
...I went back over there and I shot him.

20:09.457 --> 20:11.713
I'd give anything to have that day back.

20:12.727 --> 20:14.126
Anything.

20:14.128 --> 20:15.528
Instead of helping your mama,

20:15.530 --> 20:17.663
I walked her into her grave.

20:17.665 --> 20:20.066
Why wouldn't you share this with us?

20:20.068 --> 20:21.333
Why...?

20:21.335 --> 20:24.267
'Cause I just couldn't stomach the idea

20:24.739 --> 20:27.206
of his sons
thinking my brother was trash.

20:27.208 --> 20:28.941
My daddy wasn't trash, you're trash.

20:28.943 --> 20:31.077
- My daddy wasn't...
- No, it's true, it's true.

20:31.079 --> 20:32.400
Roller, I remember.

20:33.013 --> 20:34.280
I remember.

20:34.282 --> 20:36.082
He used to have me hold his teeth

20:36.084 --> 20:38.217
while he beat Mama with the VCR.

20:42.290 --> 20:44.223
Why would you let our mama die

20:44.225 --> 20:46.225
and then you make up
that... that bullshit

20:46.227 --> 20:47.894
- with the church?!
- I'm sorry.

20:47.896 --> 20:52.581
And that pain gonna stay with me
the rest of my life.

20:53.568 --> 20:55.434
I'ma tell you boys somethin'.

21:01.242 --> 21:02.709
I'm letting go of my baggage.

21:02.711 --> 21:05.511
Coming clean to y'all was the first step.

21:05.513 --> 21:09.282
And I pray to God y'all can forgive me.

21:12.453 --> 21:14.028
You're dead to me.

21:25.531 --> 21:26.599
Mm.

21:26.601 --> 21:29.201
I'm telling you, these people are insane.

21:29.203 --> 21:31.003
Girl, they got all up in my face.

21:31.005 --> 21:33.940
And it was two Mormons
they was walking around with

21:33.942 --> 21:35.408
and didn't want me nowhere near 'em.

21:35.410 --> 21:36.706
- What?
- Right.

21:36.708 --> 21:38.544
Look. There she go.

21:38.546 --> 21:40.413
They hiding somethin', Pol.

21:40.415 --> 21:41.948
If we want to get what we deserve,

21:41.950 --> 21:44.016
we gonna have to find out what it is.

21:45.820 --> 21:47.219
Oh, hot darn.

21:47.221 --> 21:50.756
Ken keeps text-stalking me
and asking me to lunch.

21:50.758 --> 21:52.959
If he proposes again, I'ma have
to check myself back in.

21:52.961 --> 21:55.161
- Stop it, Pol.
- I'm serious.

21:55.163 --> 21:56.205
Hey.

21:56.230 --> 21:57.630
Des, I really need to talk to you.

21:57.632 --> 22:00.166
On that note, I will leave you two alone,

22:00.168 --> 22:03.169
and I'm going to start snoopin'.

22:03.171 --> 22:04.503
What's going on?

22:04.505 --> 22:06.705
I'm tired of Uncle Daddy
and his bullshit, D.

22:06.707 --> 22:08.040
Okay, no, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:08.042 --> 22:09.241
- Baby? Baby?
- What?

22:09.243 --> 22:10.442
I don't have time for this right now.

22:10.444 --> 22:12.444
No, D, I need it.

22:12.446 --> 22:13.912
- I need it.
- Okay, talk to me.

22:13.914 --> 22:14.919
You spinning, Roller.

22:14.921 --> 22:17.283
- What's going on?
- Shh. Stop talking.

22:18.719 --> 22:21.320
You want me to squeeze your neck, baby?

22:21.322 --> 22:23.423
No.

22:31.666 --> 22:34.333
Um, so, the Seaside Suite is out of coke.

22:34.335 --> 22:36.068
- Call room service.
- No, not that kind.

22:36.070 --> 22:37.936
They want me to run down to the
corner and get them an eightball.

22:37.938 --> 22:40.278
It's a good way to get your steps in.

22:40.941 --> 22:42.941
- Can I help you?
- I was promised a Coastal Suite,

22:42.943 --> 22:45.211
and you gave me a Gulf.
Penelope Van Summers.

22:45.213 --> 22:46.701
Fix it. Now.

22:47.548 --> 22:49.081
Ms. Van Summers,

22:49.083 --> 22:52.951
I am afraid the Coastal Suite
is occupied at the moment.

22:52.953 --> 22:55.335
Well, unoccupy it.

22:56.624 --> 22:58.557
Would you like me to call Trip?

23:05.299 --> 23:06.999
Perhaps I've made a mistake.

23:08.903 --> 23:10.569
Looks like a clerical mistake.

23:10.571 --> 23:13.439
The Coastal Suite is available.

23:13.441 --> 23:15.230
Right this way.

23:15.844 --> 23:18.377
Enjoy your stay at the Bayside Rapture.

23:23.518 --> 23:26.785
- Des?
- Yeah?

23:26.787 --> 23:28.454
You breaking your new desk in?

23:28.456 --> 23:29.788
Yeah! Yeah!

23:29.790 --> 23:31.990
Okay, listen.

23:31.992 --> 23:33.860
One of those body builders
definitely knows

23:33.862 --> 23:34.993
something about Trip,
so you need to get down here

23:34.995 --> 23:37.396
- with a quickness.
- Ooh! Okay!

23:37.398 --> 23:39.365
Mmm. Get it, girl.

23:45.714 --> 23:48.107
There she is.

23:48.109 --> 23:49.909
No.

23:49.911 --> 23:51.377
Oh, so what?

23:51.379 --> 23:53.713
Well, whose baby do you think this is?

23:53.715 --> 23:55.581
You're the only one
who don't wanna use condoms.

23:55.583 --> 23:57.116
Oh, you gotta feel everything, Trip?

23:57.118 --> 23:58.518
Well, feel this!

23:59.862 --> 24:00.920
- Hey.
- Hello.

24:00.922 --> 24:02.321
What the hell do you want?

24:02.323 --> 24:04.323
I am the new co-owner
of the casino and...

24:04.325 --> 24:05.991
I'm hospitality.

24:05.993 --> 24:08.260
So, we just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

24:08.262 --> 24:10.062
Do I look like I'm okay?

24:10.064 --> 24:12.598
This asshole knocks me up and
thinks I'm just gonna go away.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.067
Why? 'Cause he's married with kids?

24:15.069 --> 24:16.536
- What asshole?
- What asshole?

24:16.538 --> 24:19.805
Piece of dogshit thinks
he can just brush me off.

24:19.807 --> 24:21.140
Well, he can't.

24:21.142 --> 24:23.342
I want you to tell
your partners Mac and Melba

24:23.344 --> 24:25.344
fixing the contest isn't enough anymore.

24:25.346 --> 24:27.479
I want half-a-million dollars
to shut me up.

24:27.481 --> 24:29.415
Okay. Well, wait. Shut you up about what?

24:29.417 --> 24:30.522
Penelope?

24:30.524 --> 24:31.600
Penelope?

24:34.155 --> 24:35.621
Is everything okay here?

24:35.623 --> 24:39.024
Desna, I thought you'd be
doing... anything but this.

24:39.026 --> 24:41.360
Well, as a new co-owner,

24:41.362 --> 24:44.830
we should be involved
in all aspects of the casino.

24:44.832 --> 24:46.566
Including the Muscle Contest.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.300
Yeah, let us carry our weight.

24:48.302 --> 24:50.502
It looks like you're carrying
enough weight as it is.

24:50.504 --> 24:52.838
Oh? You guys can't
even handle this stuff.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.440
I wanna talk about my money.

24:54.442 --> 24:56.164
Melba will handle this.

24:57.779 --> 25:02.314
Well, Desna, the Bayside way
is to learn from new voices,

25:02.316 --> 25:04.984
so you and your friends wanna be part

25:04.986 --> 25:06.586
of the Ms. Florida Muscles,

25:06.588 --> 25:08.588
then, by all means.

25:08.590 --> 25:12.324
In fact, why don't you be
our new mistress of ceremonies?

25:12.326 --> 25:14.616
Ooh-la-la! Okay.

25:15.329 --> 25:16.996
I'd be delighted.

25:16.998 --> 25:18.397
Ladies.

25:21.315 --> 25:23.315
_

25:24.138 --> 25:25.605
Hey, good call.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.139
I've been meaning to try this place.

25:27.141 --> 25:28.608
Yeah, Yelp gave it three stars.

25:28.610 --> 25:31.743
That's two stars better
than anything else in Palmetto.

25:31.745 --> 25:33.079
Yeah.

25:33.081 --> 25:34.080
Yelp's great.

25:34.082 --> 25:35.615
Yeah, it's great.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.549
You know, I've... I've been thinking,

25:37.551 --> 25:39.885
you've been through so much,
you just got out of the hospital,

25:39.887 --> 25:41.126
and I think it's...

25:42.627 --> 25:44.290
Like, you know, it's unfair of me

25:44.292 --> 25:46.426
to come at you with my needs right now.

25:46.428 --> 25:47.893
You need to take care of yourself.

25:47.895 --> 25:49.695
Wow, Ken.

25:49.697 --> 25:51.230
That makes a lot of sense.

25:51.232 --> 25:52.298
It does?

25:52.300 --> 25:54.366
I have transference issues.

25:54.368 --> 25:56.101
I basically made you my dad,

25:56.103 --> 25:58.437
who raped my babysitter
when we were in high school.

25:58.439 --> 26:00.039
And you're blaming me for that?

26:00.041 --> 26:01.373
It's not about blame.

26:01.375 --> 26:03.242
It's transference.

26:03.244 --> 26:05.511
I do all these personalities.

26:05.513 --> 26:08.714
You know, I pretend to be
people that I'm not

26:08.716 --> 26:13.185
so I don't have to actually deal
with what's really going on.

26:13.187 --> 26:14.520
Right. You're pretending right now.

26:14.522 --> 26:17.078
I know, Ken!
That's what I'm trying to say!

26:18.860 --> 26:21.593
I don't wanna deal
with what's really going on.

26:21.595 --> 26:23.062
Okay, what... what's going on?

26:23.064 --> 26:24.669
I can't be with you.

26:26.868 --> 26:28.067
Why not?

26:28.069 --> 26:30.536
Because I'm incapable
of being with anyone.

26:30.538 --> 26:33.205
Okay, okay, just, just...
Can we just wait a minute?

26:33.207 --> 26:34.429
Can we...

26:35.409 --> 26:37.009
This is not how this
was supposed to go, okay?

26:37.011 --> 26:40.480
Bryce told me to give you space
so you'd come back to me.

26:40.482 --> 26:41.613
I'm like the wind.

26:41.615 --> 26:43.282
You can't catch me.

26:43.284 --> 26:45.064
But I love you.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.220
And I know that you love me.
I know that you do.

26:48.222 --> 26:50.356
Do you need to hear me tell you
that I don't?

26:50.358 --> 26:51.691
Is that what you need?

26:51.693 --> 26:54.093
Because I don't.
I don't love you anymore.

27:14.315 --> 27:16.048
Sorry, man.

27:21.389 --> 27:22.854
Brienne, don't dilly-dally.

27:22.856 --> 27:25.457
Okay, baby? Just get your doll and go.

27:25.459 --> 27:28.327
But there's no black babydolls.

27:29.397 --> 27:30.863
Ma'am?

27:30.865 --> 27:33.332
You got some 99-cent sistas
for my baby girl?

27:33.334 --> 27:35.067
No black dolls, but we do have

27:35.069 --> 27:37.469
some black tube socks, black licorice,

27:37.471 --> 27:39.471
black pens, black beads...

27:39.473 --> 27:41.579
Brienne, you look so cool.

27:42.210 --> 27:43.543
No, Mom.

27:43.545 --> 27:45.745
I'm not going to Thanksgiving
at Grandma's.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.213
I'm sick of eating pumpkin pie

27:47.215 --> 27:48.814
off Confederate plates,
acting like it's normal.

27:48.816 --> 27:51.483
I'm so sick of being
the only black person

27:51.485 --> 27:52.818
at every family gathering.

27:52.820 --> 27:54.286
You guys don't even know
the Stevie Wonder version

27:54.288 --> 27:56.756
of "Happy Birthday." You have
no idea what it feels like.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.224
You didn't even let me meet my dad,

27:58.226 --> 27:59.291
meet my dad...

27:59.293 --> 28:00.359
meet my dad...

28:00.361 --> 28:01.894
meet my dad...

28:03.097 --> 28:04.696
...black garbage bags,
black shoe polish...

28:04.698 --> 28:05.765
I'll get this one.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.481
Nope. Nope. No, you won't.

28:09.103 --> 28:10.702
We'll just go somewhere else, won't we?

28:10.704 --> 28:12.104
Yeah, we'll go somewhere else.

28:17.111 --> 28:21.380
Hey. You were pretty upset last night.

28:21.382 --> 28:22.848
You sure you should be doing that?

28:22.850 --> 28:24.784
I'm not worried about the competition.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.986
I'm talking about being pregnant.

28:26.988 --> 28:28.120
Leave me alone.

28:28.122 --> 28:30.656
You've got someone else to think about.

28:30.658 --> 28:32.191
I know your boyfriend Trip

28:32.193 --> 28:34.660
is laundering money through the casino.

28:34.662 --> 28:36.128
Tell me who he is.

28:36.130 --> 28:38.864
Don't you know?
Aren't you working with them?

28:38.866 --> 28:40.800
No. I mean, I am,

28:40.802 --> 28:43.603
but it's not like... it's not like that.

28:43.605 --> 28:46.338
Hold on one second, okay?

28:46.340 --> 28:48.206
What do you want, Virginia?

28:48.208 --> 28:49.675
Hey, Des. The health inspector came

28:49.677 --> 28:51.743
a few days early,
and we need a new ventilator.

28:51.745 --> 28:53.078
- Excuse me, Ms. Simms?
- Des?

28:53.080 --> 28:55.014
What? There's a sea hag at the slots

28:55.016 --> 28:57.283
who just scored her third mega-jackpot.

28:57.285 --> 28:58.618
Desna? Hello?

28:58.620 --> 29:00.219
Oh, my God. Y'all are gonna have to start

29:00.221 --> 29:02.421
making some decisions for your damn self.

29:02.423 --> 29:04.490
I'm busy. Shoo, fly, shoo.

29:04.492 --> 29:05.958
Bye.

29:10.364 --> 29:11.964
Shit.

29:22.443 --> 29:23.643
Honey, I need a favor.

29:23.645 --> 29:24.910
Can you read their lips

29:24.912 --> 29:26.045
and tell me what they're saying?

29:26.047 --> 29:27.046
Sure.

29:29.583 --> 29:31.050
Asthmatic Dinah Shore is saying,

29:31.052 --> 29:33.252
"The minute the contest is over,

29:33.254 --> 29:34.453
we'll handle it.

29:34.455 --> 29:35.788
When night falls, so does she.

29:35.790 --> 29:37.790
She'll never cash that check."

29:37.792 --> 29:39.792
- Damn.
- What's that all about?

29:39.794 --> 29:41.193
Are they gonna kill her?

29:41.195 --> 29:42.462
Um, it's nothin'.

29:42.464 --> 29:44.497
I'll take care of it.

29:50.237 --> 29:51.236
Hey?

29:51.238 --> 29:52.905
Hey.

29:52.907 --> 29:55.774
- I got you somethin'.
- Aren't you sweet.

29:55.776 --> 29:57.110
I'm surprised that you called.

29:57.112 --> 29:59.779
Well, I figured it was
pretty safe to meet here.

29:59.781 --> 30:02.181
You know, it's not like we're
gonna do it in the park.

30:02.183 --> 30:04.249
Well, there was that one time.

30:05.787 --> 30:07.920
Oh, EJ, I forgot.

30:07.922 --> 30:09.722
That Girl Scout troop was so surprised

30:09.724 --> 30:11.457
to find us on their scavenger hunt.

30:11.459 --> 30:13.314
Yeah, they were.

30:13.861 --> 30:16.929
Look, I really wanna be
in Brienne's life.

30:16.931 --> 30:18.263
I know, I know. Okay.

30:18.265 --> 30:20.065
And I understand, I get it,

30:20.067 --> 30:21.800
but we're gonna have to ease into it.

30:21.802 --> 30:23.136
Listen, you're gonna meet her

30:23.138 --> 30:25.070
and then I figure,
once every other month,

30:25.072 --> 30:26.939
visitation... supervised, of course...

30:26.941 --> 30:28.874
but I'll bring her to your mama's house.

30:28.876 --> 30:30.275
I love your mama.

30:30.277 --> 30:31.744
Actually, the law says that I'm entitled

30:31.746 --> 30:33.746
- to joint custody.
- The law?

30:33.748 --> 30:35.148
Yeah, the law, Jenn.

30:35.150 --> 30:37.683
Biological parents are
afforded custodial rights,

30:37.685 --> 30:38.751
regardless of their prior convictions.

30:38.753 --> 30:39.952
Oh, I see.

30:39.954 --> 30:41.954
So you studied the law in prison?

30:41.956 --> 30:44.679
Well, I had to do something
since you didn't come visit me.

30:45.292 --> 30:47.826
And my own daughter don't even
know who the hell I am.

30:47.828 --> 30:50.696
It's okay, though. I'm back.

30:50.698 --> 30:52.770
And there's nothing you can do about it.

30:53.634 --> 30:55.048
Is that a threat?

30:56.103 --> 30:58.704
- EJ?
- Enjoy that coffee.

30:58.706 --> 31:00.373
You ain't gonna get away with it.

31:00.375 --> 31:01.907
EJ?!

31:16.057 --> 31:18.457
Polly?

31:18.459 --> 31:21.594
Once again, you're somewhere
you don't belong.

31:21.596 --> 31:23.885
Well, actually, Joe...

31:24.331 --> 31:26.199
I'm not supposed to talk about this,

31:26.201 --> 31:31.804
NDAs and attorneys, uh,
estates, et cetera,

31:31.806 --> 31:33.936
but, uh...

31:35.142 --> 31:38.811
I have reason to believe
that this painting here

31:38.813 --> 31:41.614
was, uh, stolen by the Nazis.

31:41.616 --> 31:44.238
Oh. See, I painted that.

31:44.752 --> 31:47.553
I'm a man of many talents.

31:47.555 --> 31:48.621
Mm-hmm.

31:48.623 --> 31:51.290
You sure you weren't here for this?

31:55.230 --> 31:56.629
No peeking.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.441
Is that a strap-on?

32:08.443 --> 32:09.642
Pre-Colombian.

32:09.644 --> 32:12.311
The ancients were
hella progressive, Miss Polly.

32:12.313 --> 32:16.381
Huh. Well, my great-uncle
invented the dildo

32:16.383 --> 32:18.183
in Victorian London.

32:18.185 --> 32:22.455
And, uh, he used them to treat women

32:22.457 --> 32:24.111
who...

32:24.859 --> 32:26.659
suffered from hysteria.

32:26.661 --> 32:28.461
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

32:28.463 --> 32:31.864
- You have an incredible family.
- Yep.

32:31.866 --> 32:34.867
See, my great-uncle was
the Prince of the Forest.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.469
But I hardly knew the guy.

32:36.471 --> 32:39.138
It was a simpler time then,
just me and my mom.

32:39.140 --> 32:41.006
My best friends were an owl...

32:41.008 --> 32:45.410
And a rabbit and a skunk
and everything was A-okay...

32:45.412 --> 32:49.214
Until the hunters came with their guns

32:49.216 --> 32:52.351
and their dogs and their big fire,

32:52.353 --> 32:54.620
and I got separated from my mom.

32:54.622 --> 32:56.689
And you never saw her again.

32:56.691 --> 32:57.757
Aw.

32:57.759 --> 33:01.094
I'm so sorry, Bambi.

33:11.438 --> 33:12.772
Did you get what you came for?

33:12.774 --> 33:14.495
Yes.

33:15.843 --> 33:18.555
I got exactly what I came for.

33:28.656 --> 33:29.655
- Baby?
- Yeah?

33:29.657 --> 33:30.656
We just gonna talk, right?

33:30.658 --> 33:32.057
That's what I do.

33:32.059 --> 33:33.501
I talk.

33:33.503 --> 33:34.860
What up, family?!

33:34.862 --> 33:36.195
Guess you guys came to the conclusion

33:36.197 --> 33:38.197
that it might be a good thing for Brienne

33:38.199 --> 33:40.599
to know a little bit
about her black side.

33:40.601 --> 33:42.267
EJ, we come in peace.

33:42.269 --> 33:44.731
- Hey, Darius.
- You're the one who brought

33:44.733 --> 33:46.205
your knight in shining unemployment.

33:46.207 --> 33:47.740
Captain Save-A-Ho here rolled up

33:47.742 --> 33:49.274
like he's a golddigger's dream.

33:49.276 --> 33:51.210
You drug-dealing piece of shit!

33:51.212 --> 33:53.078
Baby! Hey, hey, hey!

33:53.080 --> 33:54.613
You ain't better than me!
The only difference

33:54.615 --> 33:56.682
between your family and I
is that I got caught!

33:56.684 --> 33:59.084
- My family's business is legit!
- No, no, no.

33:59.086 --> 34:01.286
Babe!

34:01.288 --> 34:03.489
Better to retail than inhale,
huh, crackhead?!

34:05.960 --> 34:07.893
Baby! Stop it!

34:07.895 --> 34:08.893
Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!

34:08.896 --> 34:10.963
Stop! Come on!

34:10.965 --> 34:13.166
Did you get that? 4K, baby.

34:13.168 --> 34:15.431
Uh, the judge gonna love this.

34:16.571 --> 34:18.503
Maybe...

34:18.505 --> 34:20.239
Maybe I'll ask for sole custody, huh?

34:20.241 --> 34:21.639
You ain't gonna get shit.

34:21.641 --> 34:23.176
We will never let you.

34:23.178 --> 34:24.377
Come on.

34:24.379 --> 34:26.911
You said you were just gonna talk.

34:36.190 --> 34:38.190
Hey? Y'all seen Penelope?

34:38.193 --> 34:39.324
- Nah.
- Nah.

34:39.326 --> 34:40.860
Okay, I need y'all to come with me.

34:40.862 --> 34:42.795
Now. Come on.

34:42.797 --> 34:43.929
I'll be back.

34:48.402 --> 34:50.335
Y'all are not gonna believe this shit.

34:50.337 --> 34:53.206
Mac and Melba are gonna try
to kill Penelope.

34:53.208 --> 34:54.473
- What?! Really?
- Yeah.

34:54.475 --> 34:56.141
Y'all, you're not gonna believe this.

34:56.143 --> 34:57.610
I figured out who Trip is.

34:57.612 --> 34:58.544
- Who?
- The governor.

34:58.546 --> 35:00.079
My brother's running against him.

35:00.081 --> 35:02.347
Wait, no, the governor's name
is Vikram Patel.

35:02.349 --> 35:04.750
The Third. As in triple.

35:04.752 --> 35:07.152
- Trip is a nickname.
- Oh, that's some weird white people shit.

35:07.154 --> 35:08.554
No, he's not white.

35:08.556 --> 35:10.956
So the governor is laundering money

35:10.958 --> 35:12.091
through the damn casino.

35:12.093 --> 35:14.493
That's what Penelope has
on Mac and Melba.

35:14.495 --> 35:16.028
That's why they wanna take her out.

35:16.030 --> 35:17.029
What are we gonna do?

35:17.031 --> 35:19.364
We gotta protect her. Ooh, there she go.

35:22.169 --> 35:23.206
Desna?

35:23.208 --> 35:24.570
It's showtime.

35:24.572 --> 35:26.906
I hope you break both your legs.

35:26.908 --> 35:28.974
Pretty sure that's not how you say that.

35:36.383 --> 35:38.517
Nice to see you.

35:39.098 --> 35:43.122
Welcome to Ms. Florida Muscles,
everybody!

35:43.124 --> 35:46.792
Who is ready to see the ladies flex?

35:48.395 --> 35:52.397
All right, let's meet
all of these talented beauties.

35:52.399 --> 35:55.268
DJ Edison IX, take it away!

35:55.270 --> 35:57.603
First up, let's welcome
Penelope Van Summers.

35:57.605 --> 36:00.005
She loves rainy days, crazy lays,

36:00.007 --> 36:01.540
and she's good at keeping secrets.

36:01.542 --> 36:05.010
This kitty kat is in the bag. Meow.

36:22.097 --> 36:25.298
Next up, Cherry Pie.

36:25.300 --> 36:28.301
I found the redhead
snooping in your office.

36:28.303 --> 36:31.036
See, Mac, that's why
we can't have them here.

36:31.038 --> 36:32.171
Next thing you know, they'll find out

36:32.173 --> 36:33.506
the tribe is fake.

36:33.508 --> 36:35.574
If that happens, we're going down.

36:35.576 --> 36:37.977
Next up, we've got Jillian La-Sage

36:37.979 --> 36:40.112
all the way from Tallahassee.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.781
Girl, they are gonna try to kill you.

36:41.783 --> 36:44.449
No, they aren't. They gave me
a check for 500 grand.

36:44.451 --> 36:47.252
That your black ass
won't be allowed to cash.

36:47.254 --> 36:48.387
How do I know you ain't lyin'?

36:48.389 --> 36:51.124
Listen to me.
These people are batshit crazy

36:51.126 --> 36:52.591
and you know that.

36:52.593 --> 36:56.395
Once they done with you, it's lights out.

36:56.397 --> 36:58.664
I'm your only way out of this.

37:05.832 --> 37:09.274
This is the moment
we have all been waiting for.

37:09.276 --> 37:11.210
The winner of Ms. Florida Muscles

37:11.212 --> 37:14.013
will receive a lifetime supply

37:14.015 --> 37:15.214
of self-tanner...

37:15.216 --> 37:17.216
y'all know she gonna need that, hmm...

37:17.218 --> 37:20.886
the cover of <i> Bicep-tual Magazine...</i>

37:20.888 --> 37:22.355
mmm!

37:22.357 --> 37:27.026
And the grand prize of $5,000.

37:29.296 --> 37:30.496
Oh, yeah.

37:30.498 --> 37:32.765
And the winner is...

37:32.767 --> 37:34.834
Penelope Van Summers!

37:43.578 --> 37:47.713
I said, and the winner
is Penelope Van Summers!

37:50.317 --> 37:52.117
Penelope, come on out here, girl.

37:52.119 --> 37:54.587
You won the damn thing.

37:54.589 --> 37:57.987
Okay, this is beyond CP time, girl.

37:58.659 --> 38:01.660
Give us a hot 15 to sort this all out,

38:01.662 --> 38:04.063
and we'll be right back, okay?

38:09.136 --> 38:11.003
_

38:18.345 --> 38:19.478
Thank you.

38:19.480 --> 38:20.946
Tell Desna I owe her.

38:20.948 --> 38:22.081
Penelope.

38:22.083 --> 38:24.016
- Hi, Auntie.
- Hey, baby.

38:28.890 --> 38:31.854
It's a new day here
at Suncoast Rejuvenation.

38:32.693 --> 38:35.094
When we open those doors this morning,

38:35.096 --> 38:36.495
we ain't giving scripts willy-nilly

38:36.497 --> 38:37.963
to pillbillies anymore.

38:37.965 --> 38:39.565
Then what are we doing?

38:39.567 --> 38:41.100
We are healing folks.

38:41.102 --> 38:42.568
Right. Healing folks.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.237
You should listen to Uncle Daddy.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.239
- He's a leader.
- That's right.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.241
We are helping folks.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.243
'Cause I've seen the light,

38:50.245 --> 38:51.977
and I'm saved.

38:51.979 --> 38:53.626
I'm confused.

38:54.916 --> 38:55.981
Let it out.

38:55.983 --> 38:56.982
It's okay.

38:58.453 --> 39:00.519
Dr. Ken, Confetta,

39:00.521 --> 39:02.455
you are now soldiers on the frontline

39:02.457 --> 39:03.856
in the war against addiction.

39:03.858 --> 39:04.990
I'm still confused.

39:04.992 --> 39:08.127
Yeah, too. So, you mean you want a rehab,

39:08.129 --> 39:10.329
not a "rehab."

39:10.331 --> 39:11.864
Oh, I want a rehab.

39:11.866 --> 39:13.799
'Cause this little angel right here,

39:13.801 --> 39:16.135
she healed me and she showed me the way.

39:16.137 --> 39:17.603
Virginia's the angel?

39:17.605 --> 39:19.872
Everyone has their role. Okurr?

39:19.874 --> 39:22.407
Now... we only give pills

39:22.409 --> 39:24.277
to people who are truly in pain.

39:24.279 --> 39:27.079
We gonna rehabilitate some mofos, okay?

39:27.081 --> 39:28.681
We g'on clean up Florida.

39:28.683 --> 39:30.099
Change has come.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.263
Turn that shit up.

39:31.265 --> 39:32.485
Uncle Daddy going legit?

39:32.487 --> 39:34.219
I definitely need a Valium.

39:40.895 --> 39:43.096
I gave you that good-good,

39:43.098 --> 39:44.497
and it got you stalking me now.

39:44.499 --> 39:45.764
I know where you work, baby.

39:45.766 --> 39:47.366
Where you going?

39:47.368 --> 39:49.435
Hey, let me talk to you
for a minute, baby.

39:49.437 --> 39:50.703
What's up?

39:50.705 --> 39:52.371
I've been sitting there thinking,

39:52.373 --> 39:55.187
everybody been full of shit,
so I wanna be real with you.

39:56.377 --> 39:58.811
- D, I wanna do this with you.
- Roller...

39:58.813 --> 39:59.979
I think you should
listen and hear me out.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.580
I know what people are gonna think.

40:01.582 --> 40:02.715
You tried to kill me,
I tried to kill you,

40:02.717 --> 40:03.983
da-da-da, this, that, and the third.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.051
Who cares? We're still here, baby.

40:06.053 --> 40:07.987
We transcend that.

40:07.989 --> 40:11.724
Me and you, we operating on
a whole-new spiritual level, D.

40:11.726 --> 40:14.259
Is this your rap to try to get me back?

40:14.261 --> 40:15.728
D, I'm owning my shit.

40:15.730 --> 40:17.596
I'm telling you, what I told you
back at the swamp,

40:17.598 --> 40:18.998
D, that's how I feel.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.599
Like, I'm here for you
and I got your back.

40:20.601 --> 40:22.201
Why don't we do this?

40:22.203 --> 40:23.536
This smash and go,

40:23.538 --> 40:25.470
just pretend like it don't mean nothin'?

40:25.472 --> 40:27.806
Roller, I can't do this with you.

40:27.808 --> 40:30.476
Alright? E-Every time I open
my heart to somebody,

40:30.478 --> 40:32.611
my life blows up.

40:32.613 --> 40:34.893
I can't trust nobody.

40:37.021 --> 40:39.552
That's why I gotta focus on my own game,

40:39.554 --> 40:40.787
to protect my crew.

40:43.024 --> 40:44.757
D, I've changed.

40:47.428 --> 40:48.761
Prove it.

40:52.817 --> 40:54.433
Uh...

40:54.435 --> 40:56.069
- Y'all?
- Ooh.

40:56.071 --> 40:59.372
Mac and Melba were not
feeling me after last night,

40:59.374 --> 41:02.041
and I loved every single bit of it, okay?

41:02.043 --> 41:03.776
Yeah, girl, you've gotta watch out.

41:03.778 --> 41:06.379
They have got their creepy
mixed up with their scary.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.981
They're running me ragged.

41:08.983 --> 41:10.850
Did you know that concierge actually

41:10.852 --> 41:13.252
- comes from the word "slave"?
- Jennifer?

41:13.254 --> 41:16.522
Hey, listen, don't even get me
started on timecards.

41:16.524 --> 41:20.125
All of those employees lie all the time.

41:20.127 --> 41:22.327
Am I the only one who enjoyed her job?

41:22.329 --> 41:26.331
I was cracking heads
and oiling women all day!

41:26.333 --> 41:29.134
- Oh, God.
- Look at this leg, though.

41:29.136 --> 41:33.072
Besides the alarm, my shit was on point.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.339
Yes, it was, Smurfette.

41:34.341 --> 41:37.877
And that's why you're being
promoted to salon manager.

41:37.879 --> 41:39.545
- Boom.
- Shut up?!

41:42.149 --> 41:44.283
She ready!

41:44.285 --> 41:45.885
You did save my life.

41:45.887 --> 41:47.019
Thank you.

41:47.021 --> 41:48.092
- Hmm?
- Eee!

41:48.094 --> 41:49.622
You deserve it. Listen.

41:49.624 --> 41:52.225
In other business,
I talked to Penelope last night.

41:52.227 --> 41:55.494
Come to find out,
the governor is taking bribes

41:55.496 --> 41:57.162
for something he's building.

41:57.164 --> 41:58.431
- From who?
- She didn't know.

41:58.433 --> 42:00.365
But this shit is huge.

42:00.367 --> 42:01.767
We gonna find out

42:01.769 --> 42:03.502
and we gonna use it to our advantage.

42:03.504 --> 42:05.704
Ooh. That sounds like fun.

42:05.706 --> 42:07.306
Oh, yeah, it's gonna be fun.

42:07.308 --> 42:11.844
Penelope is safe,
and we are gonna run Florida.

42:11.846 --> 42:13.246
Oh, we're running Florida.

42:13.248 --> 42:14.780
- This how I run Florida.
- I like it.

42:14.782 --> 42:16.249
This how <i> I</i> run Florida.

42:16.251 --> 42:17.316
I'm running Florida.

42:54.555 --> 42:56.089
Hey, Auntie?

42:56.091 --> 42:58.291
I was thinking maybe we could go
check out that restau...

42:58.293 --> 42:59.825
What's up, Penelope?

42:59.827 --> 43:01.560
<i>Susan, are you ready?</i>

43:01.562 --> 43:03.629
Auntie left.

43:03.631 --> 43:04.955
Come sit with me.

43:04.957 --> 43:06.565
<i>Alexander, I dare...</i>
