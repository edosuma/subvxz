WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:04.689
So is it, like, serious,
more than three dates?

00:04.713 --> 00:06.806
Well, this makes five.
You tell me.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.192
- It's serious.
- It's serious.

00:08.216 --> 00:09.318
You guys are gonna love her.

00:09.342 --> 00:12.655
She's, she's funny,
and, and, and smart.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.031
And, and, and late.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.190
God, I am so late.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.734
Hey, handsome. Cool shirt.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.537
Oh, you wouldn't believe
what happened to me.

00:19.561 --> 00:20.621
I go get my nails done, right?

00:20.645 --> 00:22.873
And this chick is having this
total nervous breakdown.

00:22.897 --> 00:24.333
She caught her boyfriend
cheating on her.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.335
Something. Anyways,
she wouldn't shut up.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.586
The whole time she's
doing my cuticles.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.255
I'm, like, "God, hello, lady,

00:29.279 --> 00:30.913
I have a date, okay?"

00:30.989 --> 00:32.591
- Gina, this is...
- Oh, my God.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.792
I am such a brain donor.
You must be Billy.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.221
Uh, Bailey. Yeah. Hi.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.682
And you are Sharon, Sherry...
Hmm. Whew!

00:39.706 --> 00:41.466
I am so bad with names!

00:41.791 --> 00:42.810
Sarah. I'm really...

00:42.834 --> 00:45.271
Sarah. Duh! How could
I forget that?

00:45.295 --> 00:47.180
We had a cat named
Sarah, but it died.

00:47.797 --> 00:50.600
Cancer. Isn't that funny?

00:53.344 --> 00:56.189
I mean, it's not
funny that it died.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.483
Actually, it's kind of sad.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.984
Anyway.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.370
- Well, it's really nice to...
- Oh, listen.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.621
I'm gonna have whatever
you're having,

01:02.645 --> 01:06.292
but, God, no caffeine or I'm
gonna be bouncing off the walls.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.618
Listen, I gotta hit the wee-wee.

01:08.818 --> 01:11.579
Don't go anywhere.
We'll totally bond.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.251
Did you hear that?

01:18.578 --> 01:20.546
Um, which part?

01:21.122 --> 01:22.673
She thinks I'm handsome.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.261
Hmm.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.982
- And how about this one?
- Oh!

01:30.006 --> 01:32.902
You wore that dress to our
anniversary party, remember?

01:32.926 --> 01:35.404
Yeah, but it hangs kind
of funny on my waist.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.897
Just be thankful you
still have a waist.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.274
Put it in the pile.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.329
There's no reason the homeless shouldn't
have a few stylish things too.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.580
Mm.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.499
I've really missed you.
You know that?

01:46.523 --> 01:48.741
You guys never hang
around the house anymore.

01:48.983 --> 01:51.253
And please, don't tell me it's
because you've outgrown me.

01:51.277 --> 01:54.747
Of course not. We've just been
so busy and all, with school.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.675
I just wish you'd
come over more.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.584
Nobody talks at my house.

01:58.993 --> 02:00.805
Justin's always off
doing a million things,

02:00.829 --> 02:02.839
and his dad's always working.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.383
I don't know what's going
on with those two.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.229
That's why I roped everybody
into this clothing drive.

02:08.252 --> 02:11.347
You know, I thought maybe if we
spent a little time together...

02:11.548 --> 02:13.057
Let me help you with that.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.394
I'm just so glad you
two got back together.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.614
Yeah. Me too.

02:18.638 --> 02:19.782
I mean, you're just...

02:19.806 --> 02:21.659
You're good together. You
know, you're really...

02:21.683 --> 02:23.025
Oh, I'll get it. I'll get it.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.615
- Oh.
- Oh!

02:31.067 --> 02:32.452
Oh.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.078
Um...

02:34.988 --> 02:37.665
Well, I guess we should take
this stuff out to the car, huh?

03:19.240 --> 03:21.302
Why do you think he had his
backpack over his lap?

03:21.326 --> 03:22.595
Oh, Jody.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.253
Hey, I don't make the news.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.173
Hey, you want a smoke?

03:27.832 --> 03:30.551
Best one of the day,
right after math.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.345
Uh, I don't know.

03:33.671 --> 03:34.889
I guess.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.267
Hey, anybody got fire?

03:39.552 --> 03:40.770
Dweebs.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.272
Hey, you got a...

03:44.140 --> 03:47.151
Oh, addictive little
suckers, aren't they?

03:47.268 --> 03:49.946
Ms. Schrader. Um, hi.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.864
I, um...

03:52.232 --> 03:54.617
- We were just...
- Looking for a light?

03:55.109 --> 03:56.128
I'd love to help you,

03:56.152 --> 03:59.089
but Principal Bullock would
probably have me flogged.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.925
Come on, Jody. You
know the drill.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.876
I see your mom more
than I see my cat.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.962
And as for you,

04:06.788 --> 04:09.090
your brother's in for
quite a surprise.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.773
Hey, Gina loved you guys.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.557
She went on and on about you.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.351
Really? Gina went on and on?
Wow.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.103
Isn't she a crack-up?

04:22.303 --> 04:25.481
God, she's got this
incredible energy.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.243
Oh, she said to tell you,

04:27.267 --> 04:28.619
uh, next time you
get a migraine,

04:28.643 --> 04:31.121
try cold compresses
and Yogi Tea.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.164
You feeling better?

04:32.188 --> 04:34.250
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was
just a caffeine headache.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.292
- I'm fine now.
- Good.

04:35.316 --> 04:36.377
Because we're all gonna go see

04:36.401 --> 04:38.327
the new Harrison Ford
movie tonight, my treat.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.289
- Um, Sarah...
- Bailey...

04:41.447 --> 04:42.967
I mean, it was always weird

04:42.991 --> 04:44.260
with just the three of us,

04:44.284 --> 04:47.128
but now that I'm seeing
someone, we can double.

04:49.664 --> 04:53.050
Wait a minute. Did you say
tonight, as in tonight?

04:53.167 --> 04:55.720
Oh, God, I... That's right.
I forgot. We have that...

04:55.837 --> 04:57.513
- That thing.
- The test.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.316
Yeah. He's got a test this week.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.818
And I promised to
help him study.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.362
It covers the Crusades,

05:03.386 --> 05:05.281
and they took, man,
like, forever.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.740
So I gotta get a jump on it.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.191
And I promised to
help him study, so...

05:10.351 --> 05:12.320
- Rain check?
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.697
Bye.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.424
Aah!

05:23.448 --> 05:24.832
Oh. Ha-ha.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.593
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:26.617 --> 05:28.628
I'm a little jumpy.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.848
Who are you?

05:30.872 --> 05:33.049
I'm, uh, Charlie Salinger.

05:33.082 --> 05:35.051
Um, Claudia's brother.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.720
Are you Ms. Schrader?

05:37.837 --> 05:41.057
Uh, I'm Emily.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.392
And I'm not really nuts.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.146
I, uh, just quit three
days ago, smoking,

05:47.346 --> 05:50.617
so I'm kind of nuts.

05:50.641 --> 05:53.579
Oh, God. It'll pass.
It'll pass, I hope.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.987
Uh, carrot?

05:55.104 --> 05:56.623
Um, no. No, thanks.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.574
- I already ate.
- Oh.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.588
So, what's this about...
About Claudia?

06:02.612 --> 06:05.498
I got a message that you,
you sent her to detention.

06:05.907 --> 06:09.377
Uh, yeah. Um,
bottom desk drawer.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.128
Would you mind?

06:16.084 --> 06:18.511
- She was smoking?
- In the girls' room.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.098
Um, could you, um, put
those in your pocket?

06:23.716 --> 06:25.643
And button it, okay?

06:26.552 --> 06:27.812
Man, I...

06:27.929 --> 06:29.698
I don't know what's going
on with her lately. It's...

06:29.722 --> 06:30.981
Yeah, well,

06:31.057 --> 06:33.035
you need to talk to her before
it gets out of control.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.746
I mean, before you know it,
she'll be up to a pack a day,

06:35.770 --> 06:38.165
eating cold cereal for dinner

06:38.189 --> 06:42.368
and composing personal ads in
her head, while she puffs away.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.421
And then she'll
probably find herself

06:44.445 --> 06:46.789
on the rebound from an
empty relationship.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.634
And that's when she'll realize

06:48.658 --> 06:50.552
she has to take
charge of her life

06:50.576 --> 06:52.763
and give up smoking and caffeine

06:52.787 --> 06:54.890
and sugar, all in
one fell swoop,

06:54.914 --> 06:57.559
and she'll try to quit.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.812
And that is when she'll find out

06:59.836 --> 07:01.688
how hard it is to
start her life over

07:01.712 --> 07:03.398
without all those crutches.

07:03.422 --> 07:04.849
I mean...

07:07.677 --> 07:09.071
Oh, wow.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.031
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.033
I sort of went off
there, didn't I?

07:13.057 --> 07:14.525
That's okay.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.861
I... I think I
know how you feel.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.654
Oh, really? You quit too?

07:19.605 --> 07:23.284
Well, no, but the
starting over part.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.329
Oh, right. Right.

07:28.030 --> 07:30.583
So, anyway, talk to her.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.469
Offer her some kind of deal.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.962
Use positive
reinforcement, something.

07:36.038 --> 07:38.966
Then maybe I won't have to
call you down here again.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.218
Well, that's

07:42.170 --> 07:43.679
not really a problem.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.891
Aren't you gonna yell at me?

07:47.175 --> 07:48.517
I'm not sure yet.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.028
I mean, Ms. Schrader
and I talked,

07:50.052 --> 07:51.655
and we both think that you
probably already know

07:51.679 --> 07:53.314
what a stupid thing you're doing

07:53.514 --> 07:56.650
and how it causes cancer
and emphysema and death.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.662
And I figure you're
probably just doing it

07:58.686 --> 08:00.080
because you think it
makes you look cool,

08:00.104 --> 08:02.656
so what good's yelling gonna do?

08:03.524 --> 08:06.253
So maybe we should just,
you know, be reasonable.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.746
I was thinking maybe we
could work something out.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.041
What happened in there?
You're scaring me.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.511
No, look. What do you
want, within reason?

08:14.535 --> 08:17.505
A new bike? A leather jacket?

08:17.914 --> 08:19.256
Let's make a deal.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.634
I'll give it some thought.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.565
So Emily,

08:26.589 --> 08:29.109
I mean, Ms. Schrader,
what's her story?

08:29.133 --> 08:32.436
She's gotta be what, 25, 26?

08:32.511 --> 08:33.687
Oh, no.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.741
What?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.857
You're amazing,
Charlie, you know that?

08:38.558 --> 08:40.287
Look, you want me
to quit smoking?

08:40.311 --> 08:41.904
It won't cost you a penny.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.374
Just stay away from my teacher.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.408
- Claudia.
- No. I mean it.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.629
The last thing I need is you making Ms.
Schrader miserable,

08:48.653 --> 08:50.538
which is exactly what
you'll end up doing.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.415
Hey, you said anything
within reason.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.753
Well, this seems pretty
reasonable to me.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.841
Deal?

09:03.918 --> 09:05.845
Okay. Okay.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.805
Deal.

09:27.692 --> 09:28.961
Hey, this song's kinda cool.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.661
You know what? Maybe
we should cover this.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.037
Maybe.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.081
Oh, my God! Look who's here!

09:37.285 --> 09:38.512
Will!

09:38.536 --> 09:39.513
Gina.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.515
Can you believe it, we were
just talking about you!

09:41.539 --> 09:44.341
Yeah. I was telling her about
that test you were cramming for.

09:44.792 --> 09:45.894
Yeah. Yeah.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.730
Well, you know, we just, uh,
kinda got burnt out, so...

09:48.754 --> 09:50.774
Yeah, it was too late to
meet you guys at the movies.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.192
Oh, you didn't miss anything.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.193
The only seats that were left

09:53.217 --> 09:55.028
were, like, in the front
row, on the side.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.530
So the screen was like
this huge trapezoid,

09:56.554 --> 09:58.939
or whatever shape you wanna call it.
You know, like this...

09:59.140 --> 10:00.867
We left right after the previews.
It was awful.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.494
- Wasn't it, Will?
- Totally. It was...

10:02.518 --> 10:04.955
We're glad we left. Because
now we get to see you.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.530
- Hello!
- Hello.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.700
Whoo! Sucky tune!

10:11.527 --> 10:12.754
Doesn't he look cute tonight?

10:12.778 --> 10:13.755
Come on, Willy.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.956
On the dance floor, now.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.795
You had to study, huh?

10:22.496 --> 10:23.756
Right.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.273
Look, I'm sorry to drag you
both in here like this.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.191
I know it's embarrassing,

10:33.215 --> 10:36.685
and I don't even wanna be having
this conversation, but...

10:37.970 --> 10:41.273
Maybe we should've realized
this was going on.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.816
I don't know.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.527
The fact is,

10:47.063 --> 10:48.123
you're too young.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.460
Oh, come on. Like you guys didn't
have sex before you were married?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.118
What if something
happened, Justin?

10:53.152 --> 10:54.620
Have you thought about that?

10:55.279 --> 10:56.872
- Have you?
- I'm sorry.

10:56.947 --> 11:00.250
- I mean, we're sorry.
- No, no. We're not sorry.

11:01.577 --> 11:02.721
I don't know what
the big deal is.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.514
I mean, we're always careful...

11:04.538 --> 11:07.174
Justin, that's not the point.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.312
We know that you two are
always responsible.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.930
Then why are you acting like we
blew up a building or something?

11:13.589 --> 11:16.016
I mean, we're careful.
We're not hurting anybody.

11:16.675 --> 11:19.687
- I don't wanna hear this...
- Whoa. Whoa. Wait a second.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.281
Your mother's talking
to you now, Justin.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.523
Meaning what?

11:23.307 --> 11:24.493
You don't have anything to add?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.328
You know what, I'm getting sick
and tired of your attitude

11:26.352 --> 11:28.205
and you continue this, we're
gonna have a problem!

11:28.229 --> 11:29.456
- You guys, come on.
- Justin, you...

11:29.480 --> 11:31.156
Will you cut it out, please!

11:32.858 --> 11:35.077
Can we just, please,
talk about this?

11:35.444 --> 11:37.047
Justin, you think
nothing's gonna happen,

11:37.071 --> 11:38.414
but it can.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.748
And then what?

11:40.491 --> 11:42.010
Julia, I know what's
going on with you.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.628
I think you're letting your
hormones make decisions for you.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.381
That is dangerous.
It's a mistake.

11:48.332 --> 11:49.883
And it has to stop.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.730
I'm sorry, but that's
not a request.

11:53.754 --> 11:56.233
Yeah, well, why don't you guys
stay out of our business,

11:56.257 --> 11:57.808
and we'll stay out of yours.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.143
Come on, Julia.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.196
Justin!

12:01.220 --> 12:02.604
Justin!

12:02.805 --> 12:04.064
Justin!

12:13.732 --> 12:15.127
Nah, it was just, you know,

12:15.151 --> 12:17.327
crazy in that place. And so,

12:17.820 --> 12:19.705
I guess we just lost
you in the crowd.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.999
I mean, we looked for
you before we left.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.343
When we couldn't find you,

12:23.367 --> 12:25.461
we just figured you
guys took off, so...

12:26.203 --> 12:28.297
Man, why don't you, why don't
you just come out and say it?

12:28.831 --> 12:30.382
Say what?

12:31.500 --> 12:32.801
You don't like her.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.386
What?

12:35.045 --> 12:36.388
Will, come on.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.223
It's not that I don't like her.
It's...

12:38.883 --> 12:42.060
I mean, she's great.
You know, she's great.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.854
You know, she just...

12:44.346 --> 12:46.023
She never stops talking, though.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.035
She's got a lot of energy.
That's all.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.037
And she's not like that when
it's just the two of us.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.498
She gets nervous around people.
You have to get to know her.

12:53.522 --> 12:56.575
That's pretty hard to do when she
never lets you finish a sentence.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.004
And she's kind of
opinionated, don't you think?

12:59.028 --> 13:00.412
What, and you aren't?

13:01.322 --> 13:04.500
Look, I'm your best
friend, right?

13:05.284 --> 13:06.877
Debatable at the moment.

13:08.412 --> 13:11.016
And if your best friend
can't tell you stuff,

13:11.040 --> 13:14.218
you know, or make, like,
observations, then who can?

13:14.585 --> 13:16.897
So I just think that

13:16.921 --> 13:18.023
Gina's great and all.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.306
She is, but...

13:20.591 --> 13:22.184
I just think that

13:22.218 --> 13:23.685
you could do better.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.063
Hmm.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.110
I like her, Bay.

13:34.438 --> 13:35.906
She makes me laugh.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.036
Then... Then all that
stuff I just said,

13:41.570 --> 13:42.955
forget about it.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.041
Really.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.962
So, what are you saying?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.556
You don't wanna sleep
with me anymore

13:51.580 --> 13:52.974
because my parents disapprove?

13:52.998 --> 13:54.392
Well, no. Of course not.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.603
It's just, now we
have to sneak around,

13:56.627 --> 13:57.771
and that feels kinda icky.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.680
Yeah, but we've been
sneaking around.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.692
Come on, Jule, just don't
let this freak you out.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.152
I mean, so what?

14:04.176 --> 14:05.695
We just don't do it
at my house anymore.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.905
- Big deal.
- Yeah, I know.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.366
It was just the way your mom was
looking at me like I'm a slut.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.993
All right. Stop it. You know
she doesn't think that.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.445
She's a mom. It's her
job to overreact.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.667
And my dad? I mean, he has
no right to lecture anybody.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.868
I mean, he's cheating on her.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.879
That's not even a
double standard.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.371
That's, like, quadruple.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.377
Come on.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.430
They're just trying to take
all the fun out of this.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.348
Justin.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.674
Please don't tell me
that it's working.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.681
Look, I don't know about you,

14:42.923 --> 14:45.726
but I can't just stop.

14:46.677 --> 14:50.063
I mean, I want you,
like, all the time,

14:50.347 --> 14:52.534
and that's something
that can't just go away

14:52.558 --> 14:54.443
because my parents
say it should.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.953
Well, maybe if we just
do it at my house.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.208
Okay.

15:12.161 --> 15:16.089
Tomorrow, sets, subsets
and supersets.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.674
The fun continues.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.303
Claudia, got a minute?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.348
Um...

15:25.507 --> 15:26.735
Sure, Ms. Schrader.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.236
Just wanted to check in.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.946
See how it was going
with the smoking.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.438
Did your brother talk to you?

15:31.805 --> 15:34.191
Uh, yes, ma'am. Thanks.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.319
Uh, we sort of
worked out a deal.

15:37.686 --> 15:41.323
Good. Good. I know how
hard it is to quit.

15:41.649 --> 15:42.876
Day four for me.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.961
I think I'm finally past
the irritability stage.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.578
I'm working through denial.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.715
Of course, I'd still kill
puppies for a cigarette,

15:48.739 --> 15:51.959
but that should go away in
another, oh, 20 years or so.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.627
Mm. Carrot?

15:55.579 --> 15:58.224
Well, I never really got
hooked, so it's not too bad.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.675
Hmm. You're lucky.

15:59.708 --> 16:02.469
And you're lucky to have
somebody like, um...

16:02.503 --> 16:04.137
Charlie? Is that his name?

16:04.213 --> 16:05.607
...to support you in this.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.599
You know, I gotta go it alone.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.612
I mean, it's great that
you guys are so close,

16:10.636 --> 16:12.155
even though there's this
huge gap in your ages.

16:12.179 --> 16:15.315
I mean, he's gotta be
what, hmm, 23, 24?

16:15.724 --> 16:17.859
- Twenty-five, actually.
- Oh.

16:18.602 --> 16:19.746
And if your next question is

16:19.770 --> 16:21.039
whether he's seeing
anyone or not,

16:21.063 --> 16:23.031
well, the answer is no.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.210
But that seems to change
from minute to minute,

16:25.234 --> 16:27.077
so I can't really say for sure.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.329
Claudia, we're
talking about you.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.291
I've been around the block a few
times on this one, Ms. Schrader,

16:32.366 --> 16:34.376
so I can spot the symptoms.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.962
Let me put this in terms
you'll understand.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.686
Let's say "A" is
the group of women

16:42.710 --> 16:44.177
Charlie has dated in,

16:44.378 --> 16:46.596
oh, the past five years.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.141
This is not to scale.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.726
It should be bigger.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.395
And "B"

16:53.429 --> 16:56.398
is the set of women whose
lives he's left in shambles.

16:58.600 --> 17:03.196
"A" equals "B," Ms. Schrader.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.407
Trust me.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.413
He was totally sexy in
<i>Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

17:12.239 --> 17:14.458
And I cried throughout
all of <i>Philadelphia.</i>

17:14.907 --> 17:16.761
That scene where he's
listening to that woman sing.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.221
Oh, Maria Callas? Oh, my God...

17:18.244 --> 17:20.181
I'm welling up just
thinking about it.

17:20.204 --> 17:21.516
- It was just so...
- Gina.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.342
Gina, maybe you should
let Sarah finish.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.436
Excuse me?

17:25.461 --> 17:29.264
No. No, no. That's okay. I was just
gonna say I loved it too. That's all.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.484
What about, uh... What
about <i>Forrest Gump?</i>

17:31.508 --> 17:32.694
He was amazing in that.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.645
Oh. Well, yeah. If you
like that sort of thing.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.075
Well, you just said that you
loved all of his movies.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.286
Mm. It's not that
I didn't like it.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.862
It's just, I sort of, you know...
I hated it.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.249
I mean, if they wanted to
make a movie about a moron,

17:46.273 --> 17:48.158
they could have filmed
my science teacher.

17:50.235 --> 17:53.413
Hey, uh, did you guys catch
that, that Warriors game?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.508
Will? I am talking here, okay?

17:55.532 --> 17:59.544
I mean, all that "Life is like
a box of chocolate" stuff...

17:59.703 --> 18:00.722
Whew!

18:00.746 --> 18:03.475
I thought I'd just crawl
out of my skin and die.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.351
- All right?
- Look, a lot of people loved it.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.303
Okay? It made millions.
Foreign and domestic.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.765
Okay, I was just trying
to have a conversation.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.030
This is our
responsibility, Charlie.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.939
We-we've gotta make some rules.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.450
What do you want me to say?

18:20.474 --> 18:22.869
I mean, yeah, sure, I could tell Julia
not to let him come over anymore,

18:22.893 --> 18:24.778
but I doubt that's
gonna do any good.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.697
I don't know what goes on
in this house anymore.

18:28.315 --> 18:31.503
Look, I know you work a lot.
But there's gotta be some...

18:31.527 --> 18:33.088
Look, Mrs. Thompson, no offense,

18:33.112 --> 18:35.330
but I kind of remember
what it was like to be 16.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.926
I had to take my girlfriend

18:37.950 --> 18:39.469
to this parking lot
in the Presidio.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.795
Well, you're not 16 anymore.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.015
You are the adult in this house,

18:44.039 --> 18:45.809
and we are talking
about your sister.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.342
And I hear what you're saying.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.396
It's just, the way I see it,

18:50.420 --> 18:52.013
as long as they're gonna do it,

18:52.422 --> 18:54.776
and as long as they're,
you know, careful,

18:54.800 --> 18:56.569
I'd just as soon see
them someplace safe

18:56.593 --> 18:58.738
and not in a car parked in
the middle of a parking lot,

18:58.762 --> 19:00.031
which is exactly where
they're gonna be

19:00.055 --> 19:02.023
if we try to lay down
some kind of law.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.693
You're not gonna
help me with this?

19:11.316 --> 19:12.742
Mrs. Thompson...

19:18.532 --> 19:20.167
I worry about you, Julia.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.462
No one is looking out for you.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.556
Thanks, Charlie, for
being cool about this.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.641
I'm not cool, okay?

19:37.926 --> 19:39.487
If you're stupid enough
to be having sex,

19:39.511 --> 19:41.906
risking getting pregnant and God knows
what else, that's your business.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.357
But don't think that I'm happy
about it, because I'm not.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.322
<i>I never wanna lose you.</i>

19:50.606 --> 19:51.948
<i>That's all I'm trying to say,</i>

19:53.025 --> 19:54.367
<i>and I'm never gonna.</i>

19:59.615 --> 20:01.541
Ow. Mm!

20:01.700 --> 20:03.210
- What?
- The remote.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.753
<i>Good night.</i>

20:05.662 --> 20:06.880
Bay?

20:07.372 --> 20:09.508
- Hello?
- In here, Will!

20:09.708 --> 20:11.009
You're alone.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.346
You could say that.

20:19.134 --> 20:21.645
Did something just happen?

20:22.763 --> 20:23.980
I don't know. We...

20:24.264 --> 20:25.774
We sort of had this fight.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.994
I said some things I
probably shouldn't have.

20:28.018 --> 20:30.570
And she said some things she
definitely shouldn't have.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.864
Oh, I'm, I'm sure if
you talk about it...

20:33.565 --> 20:35.450
Nah. Not much point.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.379
I mean, it wasn't really
working out, anyway,

20:38.403 --> 20:43.301
and so we decided to break up.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.668
Really?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.754
Really?

20:49.706 --> 20:50.725
Yeah.

20:50.749 --> 20:51.967
So...

20:52.709 --> 20:54.386
I guess that's that.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.055
Wow.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.308
I'm sorry.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.893
Yeah. Me too.

21:02.886 --> 21:06.022
Maybe I'll just hang out with
you guys for a little bit.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.777
If that's okay with you guys.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.321
Sure.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.614
Sure.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.742
Not a problem.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.462
Hey, Charlie.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.175
The lady on table seven has
a couple of music requests.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.094
Did you tell her
we don't have a...

21:36.420 --> 21:38.388
"Help" and "Rescue me."

21:40.465 --> 21:43.476
There, uh, were no binoculars
in the crow's-nests.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.115
And you know, I mean,
without binoculars.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.356
You know, of course.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.322
But everybody thinks it sank

21:55.355 --> 21:57.834
because the iceberg tore
a huge gash in the hull

21:57.858 --> 22:01.703
when, actually, the
plates buckled

22:02.195 --> 22:03.881
and popped their rivets.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.332
Really?

22:05.407 --> 22:06.750
Wow.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.555
Wow. You certainly know a
lot about the <i>Titanic.</i>

22:10.579 --> 22:12.922
Well, it's kind of
a hobby of mine.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.549
Disasters at sea.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.217
And not just the <i>Titanic.</i>

22:16.251 --> 22:17.812
You know the <i>Andrea Doria?</i>

22:17.836 --> 22:18.730
Excuse me.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.680
Uh, are you Emily Schrader?

22:21.214 --> 22:22.557
That's me.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.402
You, uh... You have a phone call

22:24.426 --> 22:25.737
at the bar.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.854
Wow. Oh, wow. Ha-ha.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.315
- Excuse me, Bob.
- Sure.

22:33.351 --> 22:34.454
Blind date?

22:34.478 --> 22:35.788
It happens every time.

22:35.812 --> 22:38.124
You break up, and people
start playing matchmaker.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.917
This was Principal
Bullock's chiropractor,

22:39.941 --> 22:41.993
so I couldn't exactly refuse.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.954
And you just happened
to be at Salinger's.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.915
Call it a wild coincidence.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.042
Just in case you want
it to look real.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.211
This is so mean.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.339
God, what do I tell him?

22:55.791 --> 22:57.217
How about, uh,

22:57.375 --> 22:58.811
your neighbor called,

22:58.835 --> 23:00.521
and there's an emergency
with your dog,

23:00.545 --> 23:02.055
and you have to take
him to the vet?

23:02.547 --> 23:05.558
Wow, impressive. I like that.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.771
But what if he asks
me out tomorrow?

23:11.056 --> 23:12.565
Tell him you already
have a date.

23:14.518 --> 23:15.735
Good.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.197
I like that too.

23:26.321 --> 23:28.466
So... So Dan Campbell gave me

23:28.490 --> 23:30.551
these extra tickets to
the Sharks on Saturday.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.178
Center ice. I thought
maybe we could, uh...

23:32.202 --> 23:33.513
I... I got plans.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.588
Ah, come on, Justin. We...

23:36.915 --> 23:40.051
You didn't have to go to him,
you know, Charlie, I mean.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.013
If your parents were alive,
I would have gone to them.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.192
Belts, belts.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.517
What are we doing with belts?

23:47.551 --> 23:48.810
Over there.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.448
I just don't get it.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.700
I mean, it's not like we're
being irresponsible.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.953
I mean, I went to a
doctor and we're careful,

23:56.977 --> 23:57.870
and we love each other.

23:57.894 --> 23:59.622
And what if you get pregnant?
What happens then?

23:59.646 --> 24:00.581
I'm not gonna get pregnant.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.031
You don't know that, Julia.

24:02.774 --> 24:05.702
Look, I worry about my
son, but let's be honest,

24:05.861 --> 24:07.537
girls bear the brunt of it.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.706
You're the one who's gonna
have to live with it.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.384
And no matter what happens,

24:11.408 --> 24:12.969
it's gonna affect you for
the rest of your life.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.470
You know, I thought
we were friends.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.045
You don't need a
friend right now.

24:16.663 --> 24:17.849
You need an adult in your life

24:17.873 --> 24:19.757
who's gonna tell you if
you're making a mistake,

24:19.833 --> 24:21.185
someone who can explain
consequences...

24:21.209 --> 24:22.687
Oh, you're not my mother.

24:22.711 --> 24:23.845
Oh!

24:30.927 --> 24:32.187
You're amazing.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.907
All those different positions.
I could barely keep up.

24:34.931 --> 24:36.065
Mm.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.161
You were pretty...

24:38.185 --> 24:39.736
Pretty good yourself.

24:40.353 --> 24:41.289
Hmm.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.947
Did that feel good or what?

24:43.064 --> 24:44.365
Oh, yeah.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.953
But, uh, next time, I pick.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.080
Dinner and a movie.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.707
- It's safer.
- Oh.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.210
So, um, you're a
real expert at this.

24:55.368 --> 24:56.836
It's my second time.

24:57.078 --> 24:59.307
I'm really proud of myself
for sticking with it too.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.841
You know? Part of the
new, healthier me.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.020
It's funny, I can't
exactly picture you

25:04.044 --> 25:05.678
with a cigarette hanging
out of your mouth.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.722
How long did you smoke, anyway?

25:08.089 --> 25:09.025
Since college.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.569
I fell in with the cheap
wine and poetry crowd.

25:11.593 --> 25:12.820
And my ex-boyfriend, Wayne,

25:12.844 --> 25:14.771
all we had in
common was menthol.

25:14.888 --> 25:18.650
It got to the point, we'd go
to bed, skip sex and light up.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.703
That's when I knew
we had a problem.

25:20.727 --> 25:21.903
- That's sad.
- Mm.

25:22.729 --> 25:23.863
Tragic.

25:24.481 --> 25:28.711
I think it's 'cause we sorta
jumped past "get to know you"

25:28.735 --> 25:31.871
and went right to hot and heavy.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.008
I tend to do that.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.001
It's sort of a character flaw.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.546
Really? Me too.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.558
I'm trying to learn
to take things slow

25:42.582 --> 25:43.935
and stop jumping
into everything.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.093
Hmm.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.972
So what movie did
you have in mind?

25:49.881 --> 25:51.224
You pick.

25:52.550 --> 25:53.726
Oh, thanks.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.740
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:57.764 --> 25:58.658
You mind?

25:58.682 --> 26:00.826
No. No, absolutely.
Of course not.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.161
You know what? Actually,
you can help me.

26:02.185 --> 26:03.496
I need a rhyme for star,

26:03.520 --> 26:05.373
but nothing like
far, car or bar.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.782
Something cool like caviar.

26:08.817 --> 26:09.951
Guitar?

26:10.443 --> 26:12.505
That's perfect. That's
absolutely perfect.

26:12.529 --> 26:15.665
"With my guitar."

26:15.949 --> 26:17.917
So I've been thinking,

26:18.159 --> 26:20.670
maybe I should ask someone
out or something.

26:20.745 --> 26:21.889
Hey, that's a good idea.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.391
Yeah, I mean, the best way
to get over something

26:23.415 --> 26:25.341
is to throw yourself back
out there, you know.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.218
So who were you thinking of?

26:27.877 --> 26:28.980
Nobody yet.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.681
Oh, well, what about Dana? She
thinks you're really cute.

26:31.965 --> 26:32.900
No.

26:32.924 --> 26:34.892
She pops her gum,
drives me nuts.

26:35.593 --> 26:36.978
Valerie Shoemaker?

26:37.595 --> 26:39.188
Friends with Gina's sister.

26:39.222 --> 26:40.773
Oh, yeah.

26:45.186 --> 26:47.447
Wow. You writing a love song?

26:47.981 --> 26:49.542
Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna give it

26:49.566 --> 26:52.169
to the guys in the band and see
if they can put a tune to it.

26:52.193 --> 26:53.504
But don't tell Bailey, okay?

26:53.528 --> 26:54.588
Because I wanna sing it for him

26:54.612 --> 26:56.164
for our two-month anniversary.

26:56.531 --> 26:57.957
I know it's kind of corny.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.920
No, no, it's, uh,

27:03.288 --> 27:04.547
really sweet.

27:05.582 --> 27:06.851
You know, what about
Cindy Pickard?

27:06.875 --> 27:08.217
I mean, she's perfect for you.

27:10.545 --> 27:13.348
No, she's got that
adenoid thing.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.101
I'll catch up with
you, all right?

27:31.566 --> 27:32.784
You okay?

27:32.984 --> 27:35.119
Yeah. I just needed
to take a minute.

27:38.865 --> 27:40.051
If you're coming
down with something,

27:40.075 --> 27:42.085
I mean, maybe we
can take you home.

27:43.119 --> 27:44.837
I'm not coming down
with something.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.606
Mrs. Thompson...

27:53.630 --> 27:55.556
Julia, I'm fine. Please.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.811
Wait a minute. Are you...

28:01.679 --> 28:02.907
I teased your mother about this

28:02.931 --> 28:04.607
when it happened
to her with Owen.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.244
I gave her such a hard time

28:07.268 --> 28:10.122
for her getting carried
away like a teenager,

28:10.146 --> 28:11.572
not being careful.

28:12.273 --> 28:13.626
Wow. Justin didn't tell me...

28:13.650 --> 28:14.867
He doesn't know yet.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.994
I'm still trying to get
used to it myself.

28:18.905 --> 28:21.457
But this is a good thing, right?

28:22.117 --> 28:23.418
I don't know.

28:26.788 --> 28:28.015
There are good times
to get pregnant,

28:28.039 --> 28:30.466
and there are not-so-good times.

28:31.501 --> 28:32.677
Things happen.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.805
No matter how careful you are...

28:38.007 --> 28:39.475
You just never know.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.237
Okay.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.115
- Taste test.
- Okay.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.288
Mm.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.331
Garlic.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.051
Don't mind me.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.646
Ross's date had the flu,

29:15.670 --> 29:17.889
so he didn't need a
babysitter after all.

29:18.381 --> 29:19.766
Claudia, um...

29:20.216 --> 29:21.152
Emily and I...

29:21.176 --> 29:23.446
I mean, Ms. Schrader and
I, we're just, uh...

29:23.470 --> 29:25.448
Having a parent-teacher
conference?

29:25.472 --> 29:27.523
Well, no. You see, um...

29:28.391 --> 29:29.525
Claudia!

29:31.770 --> 29:33.488
You couldn't do it,
Charlie, could you?

29:34.647 --> 29:36.115
One stupid little thing,

29:37.400 --> 29:38.544
and you couldn't do it.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.379
Well, look who's still
carrying cigarettes around.

29:40.403 --> 29:42.455
Hey, I'm keeping
them for Jody, okay?

29:42.989 --> 29:44.216
Look, I haven't smoked any

29:44.240 --> 29:45.833
since I thought we
had an agreement.

29:46.117 --> 29:49.003
But obviously you have a few
bad habits you can't break.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.715
No offense, Ms. Schrader.

29:56.377 --> 29:57.929
That was the deal you made?

29:58.171 --> 29:59.472
Emily...

30:01.800 --> 30:03.684
I should probably just go.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.080
Hey, man.

30:26.616 --> 30:27.959
You want something?

30:28.451 --> 30:29.794
'Cause I'm kind of busy here.

30:30.662 --> 30:31.921
So I see.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.386
Come on, Will.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.690
You're taking this kind
of hard, don't you think?

30:41.714 --> 30:44.860
I mean, you only went out
with her like, what,

30:44.884 --> 30:46.519
like, six times or something.

30:47.220 --> 30:50.064
Man, I don't know who's the
bigger jerk here, me or you.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.483
Excuse me?

30:53.434 --> 30:55.329
You for opening your stupid
mouth in the first place,

30:55.353 --> 30:56.863
or me for listening to you.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.917
Hey, come on, Will...

30:59.941 --> 31:01.701
Who the hell do you
think you are, Bay?

31:02.360 --> 31:03.870
You know, I never
knew you were so...

31:05.238 --> 31:09.041
You had no right to say all that
stuff about Gina. No right.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.711
Okay. Okay.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.421
- I'm sorry.
- No.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.057
No. You know what?

31:15.081 --> 31:16.716
Sorry doesn't cut it this time.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.019
You get everything, Bay.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.345
Everything you want
comes so easy to you.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.763
Apart from grades.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.016
And you don't realize.

31:25.341 --> 31:26.443
Like... Like with Sarah.

31:26.467 --> 31:28.728
You wanted Sarah back,
and poof, she's yours.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.448
Wait a second. Is
this about Sarah?

31:31.472 --> 31:34.442
No, it's not about Sarah.
It's about you.

31:35.476 --> 31:36.370
It's about the fact that

31:36.394 --> 31:38.529
I finally find
somebody that I like,

31:38.688 --> 31:41.490
somebody who really likes me,
somebody who laughs at my jokes

31:41.566 --> 31:43.034
and who thinks I'm handsome.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.713
And you-you with
your perfect hair

31:45.737 --> 31:48.497
and your straight teeth
and your stupid dimples,

31:48.615 --> 31:49.967
say that she talks too much

31:49.991 --> 31:51.918
and she's opinionated
and she's...

31:52.285 --> 31:53.419
Whatever!

31:55.288 --> 31:56.464
But you know what?

31:57.290 --> 31:58.841
I don't care what you think.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.094
I like Gina.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.064
And I'm gonna talk to her,

32:04.088 --> 32:06.525
and I'm gonna give her the
greatest apology in history

32:06.549 --> 32:08.643
and I'm gonna pray to God
that she'll forgive me.

32:08.801 --> 32:11.354
And you can just keep your
stupid opinions to yourself.

32:21.356 --> 32:22.917
I mean, here's my mom

32:22.941 --> 32:24.325
sitting me down,

32:24.525 --> 32:27.995
telling me she's
gonna have a baby.

32:28.404 --> 32:30.799
And I'm trying to smile.

32:30.823 --> 32:34.627
I say, "Wow, Mom, that's great.
That's really cool."

32:34.869 --> 32:37.681
And I'm trying to make
myself believe that,

32:37.705 --> 32:39.006
because I know I should.

32:39.082 --> 32:43.094
But the whole time, I'm
thinking about my dad,

32:43.211 --> 32:44.521
who's with this other woman...

32:44.545 --> 32:45.481
- Justin...
- And it...

32:45.505 --> 32:46.681
No, it is sick!

32:50.718 --> 32:53.072
I have to tell her, and
it's not like before

32:53.096 --> 32:55.658
where I just had to get it
off my chest, all right?

32:55.682 --> 32:57.534
All that's gonna do is
hurt her, and right now...

32:57.558 --> 32:59.068
She has to know!

33:02.313 --> 33:04.156
And if you're the
one who tells her,

33:04.190 --> 33:07.294
I mean, if that comes
from you and not him,

33:07.318 --> 33:08.619
her marriage is over.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.256
And she'll be alone
and having a baby.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.124
I-Is that what you really want?

33:16.995 --> 33:19.130
So maybe it isn't your
mom you need to talk to.

33:22.458 --> 33:23.727
And he's making out with her.

33:23.751 --> 33:25.229
I mean, right there
in the kitchen.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.721
Ms. Schrader?

33:26.879 --> 33:29.149
Man, tongues and everything?

33:29.173 --> 33:30.516
And they were, like, you know,

33:30.550 --> 33:31.527
like groping?

33:31.551 --> 33:34.738
Jody, that is so not the point.

33:34.762 --> 33:38.075
Okay, everybody, pop quiz!

33:38.099 --> 33:39.493
Books on the floor,

33:39.517 --> 33:40.828
and no talking.

33:40.852 --> 33:44.488
Um, Ms. Schrader, you said we
wouldn't have any pop quizzes.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.074
What do you know? I
changed my mind.

33:47.483 --> 33:49.795
I thought you said things were
going pretty well last night?

33:49.819 --> 33:52.464
No. I was trying to tell you.
I made them stop.

33:52.488 --> 33:54.299
I am sick of you people

33:54.323 --> 33:56.051
not paying attention in class,

33:56.075 --> 33:59.805
so this quiz is going to
count as a regular test

33:59.829 --> 34:01.505
on your final grade.

34:01.831 --> 34:03.049
Oh, man.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.676
Don't you get it, Claud?
She's frustrated.

34:05.752 --> 34:06.895
I mean, she already
gave up smoking.

34:06.919 --> 34:08.512
That's enough to
piss anybody off.

34:08.588 --> 34:09.773
And now this guy comes along,

34:09.797 --> 34:11.806
and she's, like, attracted
and stuff, you know?

34:12.675 --> 34:14.485
And now she can't
have that either.

34:14.510 --> 34:15.862
Jody, Claudia,

34:15.887 --> 34:17.739
I said no talking!

34:17.764 --> 34:20.065
Now, that's two points
off for both of you.

34:22.101 --> 34:23.985
Oh, man, this chick
needs it bad.

34:25.103 --> 34:26.322
And right now,

34:26.563 --> 34:28.699
you're sort of the only
thing standing in her way.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.621
Now the muon

34:33.737 --> 34:36.341
is a heavy electron,

34:36.364 --> 34:39.126
and it can carry a
positive charge,

34:39.202 --> 34:40.804
a negative charge.

34:40.828 --> 34:43.514
And the pion is heavier
than the muon.

34:43.539 --> 34:45.934
Now, the pion can have
a positive charge,

34:45.958 --> 34:49.094
a negative charge,
or no charge at all.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.524
Now, who wants to take a stab

34:52.547 --> 34:53.891
at elementary particles?

34:56.761 --> 34:57.978
Bailey?

34:59.222 --> 35:01.732
Elementary particles are

35:02.600 --> 35:05.986
like, particles that are

35:06.687 --> 35:08.030
you know, elementary.

35:08.731 --> 35:11.242
Yes, well, thank you.
Anyone else?

35:11.484 --> 35:12.785
You see,

35:13.069 --> 35:14.412
each particle

35:14.904 --> 35:18.499
has its own antiparticle,

35:18.825 --> 35:20.793
only-only with a
different charge.

35:21.035 --> 35:21.929
And

35:21.953 --> 35:23.504
if there's

35:23.871 --> 35:24.807
two particles,

35:24.831 --> 35:27.800
and they're, say,
like, best friends,

35:28.084 --> 35:29.937
and the one particle

35:29.961 --> 35:35.558
says something bad about the
other particle's antiparticle,

35:36.884 --> 35:39.687
then it can set off, like,
this nuclear reaction.

35:40.012 --> 35:41.188
Sit down, Bailey.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.898
I'm not done yet, sir.

35:43.474 --> 35:44.900
You see, the...

35:45.601 --> 35:46.944
The one particle,

35:47.311 --> 35:49.289
the one that said all
of the bad stuff,

35:49.313 --> 35:50.781
that's called the

35:51.691 --> 35:52.950
butthead particle.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.120
And

35:56.154 --> 35:57.339
he owed it to the other particle

35:57.363 --> 35:59.457
to keep his stupid mouth
shut in the first place.

36:10.251 --> 36:11.270
Hi.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.521
Go home.

36:12.545 --> 36:15.065
- Bye.
- Charlie!

36:15.089 --> 36:17.349
All right, Claudia, this is...
This is how it is.

36:17.925 --> 36:21.645
I've thought a lot about this... This...
This whole thing with Emily, Ms. Schrader.

36:21.804 --> 36:23.022
And, uh...

36:23.472 --> 36:25.993
And you are not the boss.
I am the boss.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.953
- Me. Not you.
- You're the boss.

36:27.977 --> 36:29.997
And that means that you
don't tell me what to do.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.207
And you don't blackmail me.

36:32.231 --> 36:34.376
- Okay. -I'm gonna date
whoever I want to.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.920
And whatever happens with us
that, that is our business.

36:36.944 --> 36:38.005
- Not yours.
- Okay.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.455
I need this right now.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.550
And maybe you don't care
about that, but I do.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.135
- This is a good thing for me.
- You're right.

36:43.159 --> 36:46.013
And, and all deals are off. You're
gonna quit smoking right now.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.015
I don't ever wanna hear
another word about...

36:48.039 --> 36:49.256
Okay.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.269
What?

36:52.293 --> 36:53.677
I said okay.

36:53.711 --> 36:54.970
I mean, you're right.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.640
I've overstepped my boundaries.

36:58.007 --> 36:59.735
So you wanna date
my math teacher.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.352
Who am I to say anything?

37:01.886 --> 37:03.062
Go with my blessing.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.317
I gotta know, dad.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.986
I gotta know so I
can deal with it.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.155
It's over, Justin.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.293
If you didn't walk out of the
room every time I come in,

37:16.317 --> 37:17.294
you'd know that by now.

37:17.318 --> 37:18.629
You know, it was over
a long time ago.

37:18.653 --> 37:19.954
Okay, okay, fine.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.133
But I'm the one who still
carries it around all the time,

37:23.157 --> 37:24.542
and I'm sick of it.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.720
So you gotta tell her,

37:26.744 --> 37:27.721
'cause if you don't...

37:27.745 --> 37:29.171
She already knows.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.010
I told her.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.346
And it's not easy.

37:37.838 --> 37:39.557
And we're working on it.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.562
You know, uh, look, Justin,

37:46.889 --> 37:48.283
things just kind of happen

37:48.307 --> 37:49.409
in marriages, son.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.860
It's just... It
gets complicated.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.622
But the truth of the matter is

37:53.646 --> 37:55.249
that-that I love this baby.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.491
I'm-I'm happy about this baby

37:57.692 --> 37:59.285
because I love your mother.

37:59.694 --> 38:02.246
And we're, we're gonna
just see this through.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.457
You know what?

38:08.703 --> 38:11.380
Justin, this-this
isn't your issue.

38:12.623 --> 38:14.476
This is, uh... This is between

38:14.500 --> 38:15.676
your mother and me.

38:18.254 --> 38:19.513
Fine.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.391
It's none of my business.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.612
Just like what I do with Julia

38:25.636 --> 38:26.905
is none of your business.

38:26.929 --> 38:29.241
No. Wait. Wait. Justin, wait.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.618
- No, no. I made some mistakes.
- Yeah.

38:31.642 --> 38:34.194
I made some bad mistakes,
but I love you.

38:35.187 --> 38:36.248
And I'm not gonna give up

38:36.272 --> 38:38.532
my right to worry about you
and to care about you.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.502
And I'm not gonna stop
trying to make sure

38:40.526 --> 38:41.827
that you do the right thing.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.747
Because, no matter what,

38:45.823 --> 38:47.291
I am still your father.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.797
- Hey.
- Ah!

38:55.833 --> 38:57.509
God, you scared me.

38:58.127 --> 38:59.104
Again.

38:59.128 --> 39:00.554
I'm sorry.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.645
You really shouldn't be here.

39:08.054 --> 39:10.490
Right now, the only thing worse
than you being in my classroom

39:10.514 --> 39:14.151
would be you in my
classroom, smoking, so...

39:16.395 --> 39:18.238
This really isn't gonna work.

39:22.151 --> 39:23.869
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.506
I like you, Charlie. I do.

39:26.530 --> 39:29.843
But with Claudia involved,

39:29.867 --> 39:31.261
it's just a little weird.

39:31.285 --> 39:33.003
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

39:34.413 --> 39:35.807
It's okay. Claudia's okay.

39:35.831 --> 39:37.007
She

39:38.084 --> 39:39.385
gave us her blessing.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.095
Really?

39:43.297 --> 39:44.431
Really?

39:46.884 --> 39:48.769
So what does this mean exactly?

40:03.734 --> 40:04.753
Have you been smoking?

40:04.777 --> 40:06.495
Oh! Just one.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.249
Hey, I had a bad day, okay?

40:12.535 --> 40:14.586
But maybe things are looking up.

40:30.803 --> 40:32.813
I must really love you.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.314
It's for Will.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.694
- Hey.
- Hi, strangers.

40:38.894 --> 40:39.955
I missed you two.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.405
Uh, can we join you?

40:42.273 --> 40:43.166
It's okay.

40:43.190 --> 40:44.575
Sit your butts down.

40:45.818 --> 40:48.255
You won't believe how
Will apologized to me.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.633
Hey, they probably don't wanna
hear about this, actually.

40:51.657 --> 40:52.551
Are you kidding?

40:52.575 --> 40:53.468
Of course we do.

40:53.492 --> 40:58.807
Well, he actually stood on
my front lawn and sang.

40:58.831 --> 41:00.007
With his guitar!

41:00.416 --> 41:01.518
I didn't know you sing.

41:01.542 --> 41:02.436
Does he ever!

41:02.460 --> 41:04.720
He's standing, singing
"Baby, Come Back."

41:04.879 --> 41:07.107
Then, all of a sudden, the
sprinklers go off. I swear.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.641
Just tinkling everywhere.
You know what he does?

41:11.093 --> 41:12.311
Nothing.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.947
He just stands there,

41:13.971 --> 41:16.366
singing and playing his guitar.

41:16.390 --> 41:19.026
Oh, gosh, it was something
like out of a movie.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.195
You dog.

41:21.228 --> 41:22.664
It's... It's really sweet.

41:22.688 --> 41:23.582
Yeah.

41:23.606 --> 41:24.708
Yeah, well, anyway,

41:24.732 --> 41:26.918
um, we were just talking about

41:26.942 --> 41:28.295
whether or not

41:28.319 --> 41:30.871
Madonna would ever get her
career back on track.

41:30.946 --> 41:32.206
Really?

41:33.824 --> 41:35.959
So, Gina, what do you think?

41:36.911 --> 41:39.514
Well, I think she should
just get on a boat

41:39.538 --> 41:40.756
and drift off to sea.

41:41.832 --> 41:44.603
Honey, hello! Get over yourself.

41:44.627 --> 41:46.345
You're not that great.

41:52.635 --> 41:54.394
You know, we probably
shouldn't be here.

41:56.847 --> 41:59.024
Two kids, alone
in a big house...

42:00.434 --> 42:04.947
with clean sheets and
raging hormones,

42:06.023 --> 42:09.368
without the benefit
of adult supervision.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.675
Gets kind of complicated, huh?

42:25.376 --> 42:26.760
Sex, I mean.

42:29.088 --> 42:30.764
Seems pretty simple to me.

42:31.757 --> 42:34.142
You just take off your
clothes and then you...

42:35.177 --> 42:36.196
You know what I mean.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.146
I mean, think about
your parents.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.899
That's the last thing I wanna
think about right now.

42:42.434 --> 42:44.236
And we're always
gonna be careful?

42:45.229 --> 42:46.405
Always.

42:47.147 --> 42:48.583
I mean, what would you do

42:48.607 --> 42:50.742
if, you know, something
like that happened to me?

42:52.111 --> 42:53.787
It's not gonna happen.

42:54.989 --> 42:57.124
Just something to think
about, that's all.

42:59.660 --> 43:01.378
Can we think about it later?

43:01.787 --> 43:03.171
I kind of have a curfew.

43:03.289 --> 43:04.464
Sure.

43:04.665 --> 43:05.883
Later.
