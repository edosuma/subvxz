01:34.720 --> 01:37.985
NO, OF COURSE HE HAS.
I SENT HIM A PICTURE...

02:09.760 --> 02:13.389
OK...YEAH...I HAVE BEEN.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.960

ABOUT THAT.

WOULD THAT GET YOUR
A'ITENTION, CHRISTIAN?

35:58.220 --> 36:00.916
I CAN'T SEE YOU ANYMORE.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.722
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

36:04.730 --> 36:08.996
AM I MOVING TOO FAST
COOKING FOR YOU?

36:09.000 --> 36:12.128
NO.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.927
YOU CAN'T LET
THAT NICO THING

36:13.930 --> 36:16.433
MAKE YOU UPSET, HONEY.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.637
YOU KNOW HOW HOTHEADED
LATIN MEN ARE.

36:20.670 --> 36:22.831
I HAVE TO PUT MY LIFE
BACK ON TRACK.

36:22.840 --> 36:26.139
I CAN'T SLEEP
WITH PATIENTS ANYMORE.

36:26.150 --> 36:27.447
SEAN'S RIGHT.

36:27.450 --> 36:29.179
YOU DON'T SHIT
WHERE YOU EAT.

36:30.250 --> 36:31.547
I AM NOT SHIT.

36:31.550 --> 36:33.086
I'M THE SHIT,
SWEETH EART.

36:33.090 --> 36:37.789
YOU ARE SWEET AND TRUSTING
AND KIND AND...I'M THE SHIT.

36:37.790 --> 36:40.884
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

36:40.890 --> 36:41.959
WHEN MY CLOTHES WERE OFF,

36:41.960 --> 36:44.360
YOU SAID I WAS
YOUR SOUL MATE.

36:45.730 --> 36:49.461
I'M NOT GONNA BE YOUR VICTIM
THIS TIME, CHRISTIAN.

36:53.710 --> 36:55.701
YOU DO THE DISHES.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.485
YOU MISSED OUT
ON A GOOD THING.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.543
ISN'T THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE FUN?

37:41.290 --> 37:44.157
I'M HAVING FUN.

37:44.160 --> 37:45.980
AREN'T YOU, MA'IT?

37:45.990 --> 37:49.494
HMM? UM, OH, YEAH,
TOTALLY.

37:49.500 --> 37:53.527
UH, SO HOW DO WE
LAUNCH THIS?

37:55.000 --> 37:59.460
I GUESS ONE OF US HAS TO
START THE UNDERWEAR PILE.

38:08.650 --> 38:11.710
GOD, YOU GUYS ARE
SUCH PUSSIES.

38:34.140 --> 38:36.108
I TOLD YOU
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

38:36.110 --> 38:40.308
VANESSA...
COME HERE, BABY.

38:46.150 --> 38:47.947
UP.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.099
MA'IT. ..

39:00.100 --> 39:02.762
HELP ME WITH HER BRA.

39:44.380 --> 39:45.847
YOU HAVE TO BE INVITED.

39:50.520 --> 39:52.385
THIS IS ABOUT US.

40:09.740 --> 40:13.198
TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES,
MA'ITH EW.

40:13.210 --> 40:15.770
EVERYTHING.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.284
ARE YOU UPSET WITH ME?

40:34.290 --> 40:35.450
OF COURSE NOT.

40:35.460 --> 40:38.327
IT'S YOUR BODY,
IT'S YOUR DECISION.

40:38.330 --> 40:39.627
DID YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND--

40:39.630 --> 40:43.896
I MADE THE DECISION
BY MYSELF THIS MORNING...

40:43.900 --> 40:47.028
RIGHT BEFORE I TOLD JIM
I WAS LEAVING HIM.

40:48.610 --> 40:52.102
MANY MARRIAGES DON'T
SURVIVE CANCER.

40:52.110 --> 40:53.668
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.774
THERE'S A BIG HOLE
IN OUR MARRIAGE NOW

40:56.780 --> 41:01.615
THAT CAN NEVER BE REPAIRED,
AND WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

41:01.620 --> 41:05.886
WE JUST HAD TO FINALLY BE...

41:05.890 --> 41:06.959
HONEST.

41:06.960 --> 41:10.350
I'M SO SORRY.

41:10.360 --> 41:14.091
YEAH, ME, TOO.

41:17.670 --> 41:22.039
BUT I'M ODDLY HOPEFUL
NOW, TOO.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.076
WHY IS THAT?

41:24.080 --> 41:27.607
JIM DOESN'T SEE ME
AS WHOLE ANYMORE.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.874
I THOUGHT MAYBE
NO ONE COULD,

41:29.880 --> 41:33.589
BUT YOU DID YESTERDAY
DURING MY EXAM,

41:33.590 --> 41:36.616
AND I THANK GOD
FOR THAT MOMENT.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.222
IF I MAY SHARE A LESSON
RECENTLY LEARNED?

41:42.900 --> 41:46.427
DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF
HEALING THE INTERNAL PROBLEM

41:46.430 --> 41:48.489
WITH AN EXTERNAL FIX.

41:55.510 --> 41:58.638
THIS DAY'S BEEN TOUGH.

41:58.650 --> 42:01.141
I'M GONNA GO GET BLO'ITO
ON A MOJITO.

42:01.150 --> 42:03.573
A DOUBLE.

42:03.580 --> 42:06.515
THANK YOU, DR. MCNAMARA,
FOR EVERYTHING.

42:13.590 --> 42:15.649
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN ME?

42:15.660 --> 42:17.855
I'M SORRY.

42:17.860 --> 42:19.020
WE HAVE A POLICY HERE

42:19.030 --> 42:22.238
THAT WE DON'T SEE
PATIENTS SOCIALLY...

42:24.200 --> 42:28.409
BUT I AM ALLOWED
TO WALK YOU TO YOUR CAR.

42:28.410 --> 42:31.971
* NOTHING NATURAL *

42:31.980 --> 42:35.017
* COULD COME BETWEEN *

42:35.020 --> 42:40.743
* ENAMORED MORTALS
SUCH AS WE *

42:40.750 --> 42:46.723
* THE WINDS MAY BLOW US
FAR APART *

42:46.730 --> 42:50.291
* BUT NOTHING WILL UNDO *

42:50.300 --> 42:52.791
* OUR HEARTS *

42:52.800 --> 42:56.839
* NO MATTER HOW FAR
I WANDER *

42:56.840 --> 42:59.866
* WHAT STARS I'M UNDER *

42:59.870 --> 43:06.105
* I'LL ALWAYS COME BACK TO YOU *

43:09.380 --> 43:12.417
* NOTHING NATURAL *

43:12.420 --> 43:15.753
* COULD TURN THE TIDE *

43:15.760 --> 43:18.820
* THAT WASHES OVER *

43:18.830 --> 43:22.027
* BOTH OUR LIVES... *

43:22.030 --> 43:23.952
WHAT?

43:23.960 --> 43:27.623
NOTHING. I JUST WANT
TO KISS YOU.

43:27.630 --> 43:30.235
I KISS YOU ALL THE TIME.

43:30.240 --> 43:33.437
* ...BECOMES OF US *

43:33.440 --> 43:37.570
* NO MATTER HOW FAR I TUMBLE *

43:37.580 --> 43:40.105
* WHAT SPELL I'M UNDER *

43:40.110 --> 43:48.245
* I'LL ALWAYS COME BACK TO *

43:48.250 --> 43:54.723
* TO YOU *

43:54.730 --> 44:00.191
* TO YOU... *

44:03.670 --> 44:06.138
YOU THANKED ME EARLIER.

44:06.140 --> 44:10.907
ACTUALLY, I'M THE ONE
WHO SHOULD THANK YOU.

44:10.910 --> 44:13.902
I'M NOT NORMALLY THE ONE
WITH THE BEDSIDE MANNER.

44:13.910 --> 44:16.743
THAT'S USUALLY MY PARTNER...

44:18.480 --> 44:22.450
BUT WHEN I WAS TREATING YOU,

44:22.460 --> 44:25.384
I FELT LIKE A HEALER AGAIN.

44:25.390 --> 44:27.085
IT WAS VERY NICE, MEGAN.

44:27.090 --> 44:30.253
WELL, YOU'RE A VERY
NICE MAN, DR. MCNAMARA.

44:30.260 --> 44:31.761
SEAN.

44:31.770 --> 44:35.399
OUT OF THE LAB COAT,
I'M JUST SEAN.

45:02.330 --> 45:03.797
GOOD-BYE, MEGAN.

45:05.230 --> 45:06.925
GOOD-BYE, SEAN.

45:28.390 --> 45:30.312
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

45:44.870 --> 45:46.132
WHO DIED?

45:46.140 --> 45:47.903
IT'S RECENTLY BEEN
BROUGHT TO MY A'ITENTION

45:47.910 --> 45:50.879
THAT CROSSING THE
PATIENT/ DOCTOR BOUNDARY LINE

45:50.880 --> 45:52.404
IS NOT THAT UNCOMMON
AI-TER ALL.

45:52.410 --> 45:55.470
YOU'RE THE PATIENT I WANT
TO TAKE THAT CHANCE WITH.

46:06.430 --> 46:09.194
* WHERE DO I BEGIN *

46:09.200 --> 46:14.126
* TO TELL THE STORY OF
HOW GREAT A LOVE CAN BE? *

46:14.130 --> 46:19.329
* THE SWEET LOVE STORY
THAT IS OLDER THAN THE SEA *

46:19.340 --> 46:23.800
* A SIMPLE TRUTH ABOUT
THE LOVE HE BRINGS TO ME *

46:23.810 --> 46:24.799
Man: BLISS?

46:24.810 --> 46:29.770
* WHERE DO I START? *

46:29.780 --> 46:32.248
I'M ISAAC.
