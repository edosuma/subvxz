WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:02.803
( engine whirring )

00:25.759 --> 00:27.695
( seagulls cawing )

00:51.552 --> 00:53.053
Your payment.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.489
In full.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.510
What happened
to his ear?

01:18.312 --> 01:19.580
You sure this is him?

01:21.882 --> 01:23.851
He confessed
before I clipped him.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.464
We need
to leave tonight.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.800
Is that so?

01:39.833 --> 01:43.204
I didn't realize
you were dictating
the terms now.

01:43.237 --> 01:46.607
- We had a deal.
- I'm not balking, Regent.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.245
Anchor's up at midnight.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.746
Don't be late.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.517
Time and tide wait
for no man,

01:56.550 --> 01:58.186
not even you.

02:37.891 --> 02:38.292
( chatter )

02:43.764 --> 02:45.199
We're leaving tonight.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.834
What?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.569
- How?
- The less you know,
the better.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.638
Just wait here for me
and M.K. to get back.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.773
I can't.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.542
I have to get back
to the fort.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.944
Jade's been poisoned,
the baron's expecting me.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.880
If you go in there,
I'm not sure I can
get you out.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.815
Just stay here.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.853
Sunny.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.927
Did you kill my parents?

03:19.267 --> 03:21.935
Quinn did it.
I told you.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.072
With your sword?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.844
Were you there?

03:30.878 --> 03:34.715
So you could've stopped him,
but you didn't.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.287
And then you lied to me
about it.

03:44.692 --> 03:45.993
When we get out
of here,

03:46.026 --> 03:48.429
everything will
be different,
I promise you.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.698
How, Sunny?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.302
You gonna stop
being a killer?

03:54.335 --> 03:57.671
Throw away your sword,
scrub your back clean?

04:00.040 --> 04:01.975
The baron said

04:02.009 --> 04:04.044
we are all slaves
to our nature

04:04.077 --> 04:06.514
and I am beginning
to think he's right.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.849
Veil,

04:08.882 --> 04:12.052
this is our only chance.
We have to take it.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.489
If I'm still here
when you get back,

04:15.523 --> 04:17.625
you'll know my answer.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.642
( insects chirping )

05:03.036 --> 05:04.538
Man:
Brothers.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.548
Penrith sent me.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.553
He's discovered
another child,

05:19.587 --> 05:20.821
a dark one.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.061
He's a day's drive
from here.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.908
( engine starts )

05:56.690 --> 05:58.626
Welcome back
to the living.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.661
What happened?
What's--

06:00.694 --> 06:02.396
what's going on?

06:02.430 --> 06:04.131
We're not sure yet.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.934
Maybe too many hours
under the hot sun
yesterday.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.702
Quinn:
The sun didn't do this.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.474
She was poisoned.
Veil told me.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.775
What?

06:16.577 --> 06:18.045
I-- I don't understand.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.648
Perhaps Lydia can explain.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.187
Monkshood flower,

06:27.220 --> 06:30.491
hidden in the false bottom
of your jewelry box.

06:32.926 --> 06:33.961
( gasps )

06:39.533 --> 06:41.769
Quinn,

06:41.802 --> 06:42.803
I didn't do this.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.839
I could have your head,

06:45.873 --> 06:48.776
but that would be
too quick and too kind.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.912
- Listen to me--
- I heard rumors
after Beatrice,

06:51.945 --> 06:54.782
but I refused
to believe them.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.086
I never wanna
see you again.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.555
Don't do this.
I'm innocent.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.592
Escort her to the gate.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.896
You--
( grunts )

07:08.929 --> 07:11.599
( panting )

07:29.750 --> 07:33.220
I'm so sorry
I was blind to this.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.090
Quinn, there's something
I have to tell you.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.496
It's about Ryder.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.105
( doors clanging )

08:09.890 --> 08:11.491
Ryder:
I'll take her from here.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.198
Are you really gonna
let your father
kick me out?

08:18.231 --> 08:19.967
He's the baron.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.003
As you taught me,
who am I to question
his orders

08:23.036 --> 08:25.038
even if they go against
his best interests?

08:25.072 --> 08:26.940
Ryder,
he trusts you now.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.976
Your plea wouldn't fall
on deaf ears.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.711
Don't beg, Mother.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.980
I'm not begging.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.749
Help me prove
Jade poisoned herself.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.687
And why would I
do that?

08:43.156 --> 08:45.659
You told her
about Beatrice.

08:46.794 --> 08:47.995
I may have warned her

08:48.028 --> 08:50.230
that you have a tendency
to turn on people.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.103
For the journey.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.175
Oh, you really are
a stupid, petulant boy,
aren't you?

09:04.244 --> 09:05.813
Your father stole Jade,

09:07.214 --> 09:09.349
but you can't
let her go, can you?

09:09.382 --> 09:11.318
Oh, don't worry,

09:11.351 --> 09:14.087
I haven't told him
you're still sleeping
together.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.259
You won't last
a month in here without me.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.947
( birds chirping )

09:39.980 --> 09:43.383
The Widow came through
the emergency tunnel
under the wall.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.719
Sunny has one
of the only keys.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.622
A few weeks ago,
he was seen talking
to the Widow.

09:48.656 --> 09:51.692
And you chose not
to bring this encounter
to my attention.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.161
- Why?
- He told me she tried
to bribe him,

09:54.194 --> 09:56.029
but he rejected it.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.099
- I believed him.
- Well, why wouldn't you?

09:59.132 --> 10:01.635
Sunny's loyalty's
been unimpeachable.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.771
But I think
he's played us both.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.373
Lock down the fort.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.842
Have Sunny meet me
in the chapel.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.048
That pendant.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.319
The one you took
from Sunny's Colt.

10:19.352 --> 10:22.255
Do you still have it?

10:23.691 --> 10:25.192
What made you think
of that?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.395
Just curious.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.331
No, I traded it.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.137
So be it.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.885
- Come on!
- Oh!

10:54.988 --> 10:57.290
What have you
been up to, Sunny?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.026
Tracking the Widow.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.128
Well, you wouldn't
have to track her

11:01.161 --> 11:04.698
if you'd clipped her
while she was prowling
inside our walls.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.366
She's wounded.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.001
Wounded?

11:08.035 --> 11:10.437
The Sunny I know
never missed a kill.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.244
I still remember
the first time I saw you
in this chapel.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.379
You were sitting right here
in the front row,

11:19.412 --> 11:22.215
never averted your gaze.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.985
You drank in my words

11:25.018 --> 11:26.854
like a true believer.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.857
I sensed
you were special.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.492
And that's
why I gave you a life

11:32.525 --> 11:35.262
that most people
can only dream of.

11:35.295 --> 11:38.398
I trained you,
groomed you,

11:38.431 --> 11:41.234
trusted you.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.336
Tell me, Sunny,

11:45.138 --> 11:46.506
what else
could I have done

11:46.539 --> 11:49.209
to keep you
from betraying me?

11:53.346 --> 11:55.082
We have a traitor
in our midst.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.754
You're hereby stripped
of your rank.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.856
Turn over your sword.

12:17.938 --> 12:21.174
You gonna cut me down,
Sunny, hmm?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.976
And then what?

12:23.010 --> 12:25.012
Fight your way
through your own men

12:25.045 --> 12:27.114
in some vain bid
for freedom?

12:35.488 --> 12:37.090
Your Colt
is very loyal.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.028
Didn't spill a bean.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.265
Lock the traitor
in chains

12:45.298 --> 12:48.268
until I decide
an appropriate fate.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.905
And then get his woman
and bring her to me.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.281
If you're going
to kill Sunny,
kill me, too.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.953
Now, why would I
kill a boy

13:05.986 --> 13:09.289
with such
a bright future?

13:15.996 --> 13:18.265
( chatter )

13:35.382 --> 13:38.451
( footsteps passing )

13:52.432 --> 13:54.101
( muffled scream )

13:58.171 --> 14:00.207
( panting )

14:00.240 --> 14:01.942
Where am I?

14:17.557 --> 14:19.292
Thank you for coming.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.394
Why am I here?

14:25.365 --> 14:26.900
I need you
to stitch me up.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.335
There's somewhere
I need to be.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.603
Looks like septicemia.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.239
Blood poisoning.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.307
You need to stay put
if you wanna live.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.543
You're lucky
it hasn't spread.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.411
Can you stop it?

14:38.445 --> 14:40.380
Not with my hands tied.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.425
If I help,

14:52.459 --> 14:54.594
how do I know
you'll let me go?

14:54.627 --> 14:56.997
You have my word.

14:57.030 --> 15:00.067
( chuckles )

15:00.100 --> 15:03.036
Forgive me
if I don't believe you.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.938
I have no reason
to kill you.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.474
In fact, I bet we want
the same thing.

15:07.507 --> 15:12.045
A peaceful world
where all women have
a voice that's heard.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.588
I need two pots
of clean water,

15:21.621 --> 15:24.257
clean sheets,
and more light.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.597
Are you in much pain?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.232
Of course.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.436
How do I know
that's not poison?

15:38.205 --> 15:39.439
You don't.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.145
Okay.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.522
Who did this?

15:55.555 --> 15:57.524
The man you love.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.493
You could spend
your entire life

16:00.527 --> 16:02.062
cleaning up after him.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.598
- ( screams )
- ( gasps )

16:08.168 --> 16:10.137
Do you want my help

16:10.170 --> 16:11.638
or don't you?

16:14.174 --> 16:17.110
( metal door clanging )

16:21.381 --> 16:23.250
Where's Veil, Sunny?

16:23.283 --> 16:27.154
You send her away?

16:27.187 --> 16:28.555
I'll find her.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.557
You kill her,

16:30.590 --> 16:32.392
you kill yourself.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.728
I have no intention
of harming Veil
or your baby.

16:35.762 --> 16:39.099
I plan to raise your child
right here in this fort.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.700
Just like I raised you.

16:40.733 --> 16:44.771
Hopefully, your offspring
will show me more gratitude.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.739
Why am I not dead?

16:46.773 --> 16:50.377
You haven't told me
all your secrets.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.646
M.K.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.649
I heard stories
about people like him
when I was a cog,

16:56.683 --> 16:59.052
but who would ever
actually believe

16:59.086 --> 17:02.055
that they exist,
let alone walk
amongst us?

17:02.089 --> 17:05.792
Now I know why the Widow
wanted to get her hands
on him.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.328
He's worth
how many Clippers?

17:08.361 --> 17:09.729
10, 20?

17:09.762 --> 17:12.432
A whole army,
perhaps?

17:15.502 --> 17:17.670
I can't wait
to fill his back

17:17.704 --> 17:19.806
with little
black lines.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.348
Quinn.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.720
When I get out
of these chains,

17:33.753 --> 17:36.556
I'm gonna
clip you first.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.526
That's just like
I told Veil--

17:39.559 --> 17:42.595
you'll always be
a killer.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.832
( grunting )

18:26.306 --> 18:28.508
I have
nowhere else to go.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.280
Show your daughter
some mercy.

18:34.814 --> 18:38.117
My daughter died
in my heart years ago.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.293
No, I know
I've strayed.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.860
But...

18:50.530 --> 18:52.165
...I could be saved.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.704
Please.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.273
Show me
how to get back to you.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.681
Kneel.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.586
( sniffles )

19:14.887 --> 19:16.623
Are you willing
to renounce

19:16.656 --> 19:18.658
all material
possessions?

19:20.360 --> 19:21.594
I am.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.763
Will you rededicate
yourself

19:23.796 --> 19:25.532
to a spiritual path?

19:27.234 --> 19:28.468
I will.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.570
Do you promise

19:30.603 --> 19:32.739
never to leave again?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.507
I do.

19:45.785 --> 19:46.286
( birds chirping )

19:49.689 --> 19:51.491
( clears throat )

19:52.592 --> 19:53.760
Scissors.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.233
What happened here?

20:00.267 --> 20:01.668
Oh, my late husband

20:01.701 --> 20:03.736
had a funny way
of showing his affection.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.840
Is that why you're
fighting?

20:07.874 --> 20:10.443
To rid the world
of brutal men?

20:10.477 --> 20:12.879
There wouldn't
be many men left
if we did that.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.948
I like you, Veil.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.518
Under different
circumstances,

20:18.551 --> 20:19.919
we could have
been friends.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.722
I think that's
the opium talking.

20:31.698 --> 20:34.000
- What's this?
- One of these is a tincture

20:34.033 --> 20:35.802
which will prevent you
from dying.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.637
The other two
are poisons.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.408
I will be happy
to tell you which
is which

20:41.441 --> 20:43.242
after I'm safely
back at my clinic.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.847
I'm not sure
what you will be
returning back to.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.683
Quinn won't survive
the night.

20:50.717 --> 20:54.020
I warned Sunny
that his loyalty
would be his downfall.

20:54.053 --> 20:57.357
I just hope he heeded
my advice.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.693
What have you done?

21:00.727 --> 21:03.963
I've set things in motion
to make this world safer,

21:03.996 --> 21:06.366
not only for my children,
but for yours.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.035
Just know you'll always
have a place here.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.837
Tilda,

21:10.870 --> 21:12.539
take the good
doctor home.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.347
M.K.:
Where's Sunny?

21:20.380 --> 21:21.814
Alive.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.450
Are you gonna
kill him?

21:23.483 --> 21:26.486
Well, that's
up to you, M.K.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.389
I believe you have
the potential

21:29.422 --> 21:31.057
to be a great Clipper.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.025
Even greater than Sunny.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.864
I don't wanna
kill people.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.866
I just wanna get home.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.801
You're not doing this
for me.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.603
This is for Sunny.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.572
So if I do what I'm told,
then he stays alive?

21:45.605 --> 21:47.407
( chuckles )

21:47.440 --> 21:49.476
I don't think you're capable
of doing what you're told.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.779
I just want you
to become the best
you can be.

21:52.812 --> 21:53.813
Please.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.655
I was like you, M.K.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.024
Uncertain of my future.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.526
I wanted to run away

22:06.559 --> 22:08.094
to someplace
far beyond the Badlands

22:08.127 --> 22:10.630
where life was easy

22:10.663 --> 22:13.099
and all my problems
would disappear.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.035
Now that place

22:16.068 --> 22:18.438
is an illusion.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.106
You don't know that.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.910
You see
that building, hmm?

22:25.612 --> 22:28.881
It was once the seat of power
for the entire world.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.684
It stood tall

22:31.718 --> 22:33.953
in a shining city
on a hill

22:33.986 --> 22:36.656
where so-called
enlightened men

22:36.689 --> 22:39.392
promised their citizens
a bright future.

22:39.426 --> 22:42.529
A future
where impossible dreams

22:42.562 --> 22:43.730
could become reality.

22:47.099 --> 22:49.068
We live
in a husk of a world

22:49.101 --> 22:53.105
left to us by these
enlightened men.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.942
You don't fix it
by running.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.544
You do it by fighting.

23:02.114 --> 23:03.916
I see what you did
to Sunny now.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.486
And what did I do
that was so terrible?

23:06.519 --> 23:08.688
I gave him a life,
taught him skills,

23:08.721 --> 23:10.690
allowed him to thrive.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.860
You think
that I turned Sunny
into a killer?

23:13.893 --> 23:16.028
No, no.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.531
That was always
inside him.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.535
Life here does not
have to be hard.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.972
I understand
that there's a Butterfly

23:26.005 --> 23:27.707
that you have
feelings for.

23:27.740 --> 23:31.177
I could
catch her for you.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.713
The Widow's not long
in this world.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.448
Once she's dead,

23:35.482 --> 23:38.084
those girls won't survive
without her.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.657
- You'd protect Tilda?
- She could live in the fort

23:44.691 --> 23:47.794
and you could be with her
whenever you want.

23:49.729 --> 23:52.465
- And what about Sunny?
- I'd spare him

23:52.499 --> 23:54.567
if that's
what you wish.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.044
Tonight,

24:05.077 --> 24:07.179
to celebrate
our understanding,

24:07.213 --> 24:09.482
I'll take you
to the Tick-Tock

24:09.516 --> 24:11.651
and pay for your
first doll.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.019
Trust me,

24:13.052 --> 24:15.755
you don't want Tilda
to be your first.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.024
Make a fool of yourself
in front of her,

24:18.057 --> 24:19.759
no, no.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.628
That's what dolls
are for.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.530
( chuckles )

24:35.608 --> 24:38.244
My father's heading
outside the gates tonight.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.047
Unescorted.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.915
Why would he risk
doing that?

24:42.949 --> 24:45.552
Because he's
arrogant and old.

24:45.585 --> 24:47.186
( chuckles )

24:47.219 --> 24:49.221
He'll only have
a Colt with him.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.590
Then I'll bring
Jacobee.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.925
He's definitely
looking forward

24:52.959 --> 24:54.594
to killing your father
himself.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.865
Once he does,
I'll clip him.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.235
- I'll notify the Widow.
- I wouldn't bother.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.538
I know we made
an alliance with her,

25:05.572 --> 25:07.574
but she raided the fort
last night.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.942
And Sunny
wounded her badly.

25:09.976 --> 25:13.245
She's probably bleeding out
in a ditch somewhere.

25:13.279 --> 25:16.115
Trust me,
we don't need her,
anyway.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.984
Just think,

25:18.017 --> 25:21.120
by sunrise tomorrow...

25:22.789 --> 25:25.625
...there will be
two new barons
in the Badlands.

25:31.898 --> 25:34.133
( water trickling )

25:34.166 --> 25:36.035
Waldo:
Sunshine!

25:37.737 --> 25:39.572
What the hell
you doing in there?

25:39.606 --> 25:41.841
No one can talk
to the prisoners.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.576
Baron's orders.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.277
I understand.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.113
- ( thuds )
- ( grunts )

25:47.146 --> 25:48.648
( neck snaps )

26:00.292 --> 26:03.896
I'll expect you
and your little
girly friend

26:03.930 --> 26:06.132
to get on
the River King's boat

26:06.165 --> 26:07.800
and not look back.

26:07.834 --> 26:10.102
Shit's gonna go down
here tonight

26:10.136 --> 26:12.204
you do not wanna be
a part of.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.040
What do you mean?

26:14.073 --> 26:16.308
The Widow,

26:16.342 --> 26:18.645
she's making a move.

26:18.678 --> 26:21.848
She's gonna take out
Jacobee and Quinn

26:21.881 --> 26:23.015
at the same time.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.818
You're working
with the Widow?

26:27.854 --> 26:30.623
You're the one,
the traitor.

26:30.657 --> 26:32.191
You know, personally,

26:32.224 --> 26:35.161
I prefer the word
"idealist."

26:35.194 --> 26:37.296
Or maybe
"revolutionary."

26:37.329 --> 26:39.799
The system is broken.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.934
We gotta blow it up
and start again.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.604
And you think the Widow
is the answer?

26:48.140 --> 26:50.076
Now, you can stand here
debating this

26:50.109 --> 26:52.244
or you can get the hell
out of here.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.781
Why are you helping me?

26:54.814 --> 26:56.849
Because...

26:56.883 --> 27:00.152
I should've saved you
from this life
a long time ago.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.322
Should've left you
at the river

27:03.355 --> 27:05.391
or maybe just
slit your throat.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.297
That belongs to you.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.199
At least,

27:13.232 --> 27:15.735
it was around your neck
when I found ya.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.078
Now go.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.250
Have the life
you deserve.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.785
Where's M.K.?

27:32.819 --> 27:34.821
He's with Quinn.

27:34.854 --> 27:38.257
Quinn's taking him
to the doll house tonight
for a wicking.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.826
Should be memorable.

27:39.859 --> 27:43.162
That's where the ambush
is going down.

27:44.731 --> 27:46.432
Be smart, Sunny.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.367
Forget about the boy
and leave.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.902
Now.

27:49.936 --> 27:52.071
It's your only chance.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.975
( insects chirping )

28:05.952 --> 28:08.320
The way you worked
to save my mother,

28:08.354 --> 28:10.322
thank you.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.359
I really don't think

28:13.392 --> 28:15.728
she has your best
interests in mind.

28:15.762 --> 28:17.730
You don't know her.

28:17.764 --> 28:20.967
Any woman
who forces girls to kill

28:21.000 --> 28:23.736
to show their love
is not a mother.

28:23.770 --> 28:26.138
What other choice
do I have?

28:26.172 --> 28:28.340
I can't abandon
the others.

28:30.209 --> 28:34.146
I could give you
another option.

28:36.182 --> 28:37.817
The three bottles.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.887
The blue one
is the tincture.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.956
The other two
are filled with poison.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.029
What are you
suggesting?

28:51.463 --> 28:53.966
That you decide
your own future.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.143
( doors clanging )

29:09.816 --> 29:11.884
( indistinct chatter )

29:15.521 --> 29:17.289
I'm sure
you're nervous.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.325
Don't be.
This is a rite
of passage.

29:19.358 --> 29:22.461
Sunny was your age
when I brought him here.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.931
Something's wrong.

29:24.964 --> 29:27.266
- Hmm?
- Where is everyone?

29:29.368 --> 29:31.938
You know,
when I was a boy,

29:31.971 --> 29:35.007
I could taste the air change
before a lightning storm.

29:36.843 --> 29:39.378
Feel the electricity
running down my spine.

29:39.411 --> 29:43.883
I can still tell
when a storm's
brewing around me.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.553
Don't skulk
in the shadows.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.857
Now, if you're here
to clip me,

29:50.890 --> 29:54.326
at least have the courtesy
to show your faces.

30:02.101 --> 30:05.171
Is your baron joining
this hunting party?

30:15.414 --> 30:18.317
Quinn:
Always good
to see you, Jacobee.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.919
And your friends.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.241
You always told me

30:42.274 --> 30:44.410
power is taken.

30:44.443 --> 30:47.346
Well, I finally
listened.

30:47.379 --> 30:50.983
Except I always took it
with my own hands.

30:51.017 --> 30:53.419
There'll be
no turning back
after this.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.221
No forgiveness.

30:55.254 --> 30:58.024
I'm not looking
for redemption.

30:58.057 --> 31:00.026
Jacobee:
You were always arrogant.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.028
You overreached, Quinn.

31:03.495 --> 31:06.198
We're all gathered here
because of one woman--

31:06.232 --> 31:08.000
the Widow.

31:08.034 --> 31:11.570
She believes she's outplayed
and outmaneuvered us.

31:11.603 --> 31:14.040
Plans to take over
our territories

31:14.073 --> 31:15.641
once we've destroyed
each other tonight.

31:15.674 --> 31:18.610
That sickness in your head
has made you delusional.

31:18.644 --> 31:20.579
No, it's made me
vigilant.

31:20.612 --> 31:22.181
Given me clarity.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.183
Helped me find

31:24.216 --> 31:26.218
new strength.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.586
After you're dead,

31:27.619 --> 31:28.955
she's next.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.123
( screams )

31:35.227 --> 31:38.197
( heart beating )

31:54.180 --> 31:55.347
( grunting )

31:57.316 --> 31:59.018
( yells )

32:15.701 --> 32:19.305
I assume a conversation's
out of the question?

32:23.675 --> 32:25.477
( yells )

32:25.511 --> 32:26.979
( groans )

32:27.013 --> 32:29.448
You're going to be
my last tattoo.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.389
( man yells )

32:37.423 --> 32:38.991
( grunts )

32:51.703 --> 32:53.639
M.K., stop!

32:56.442 --> 32:58.244
I know you can
control this.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.376
( thuds )

33:30.409 --> 33:31.510
( grunts )

33:31.543 --> 33:33.179
( yelps )

33:35.214 --> 33:36.682
( screams )

33:53.399 --> 33:55.201
If you wanna take him,

33:55.234 --> 33:57.736
you'll have to go
through me first.

36:36.462 --> 36:37.596
( crashes )

37:24.510 --> 37:27.379
( all chanting softly )

37:29.748 --> 37:31.850
( frogs croaking )

37:41.527 --> 37:44.396
( chanting continues )

38:07.353 --> 38:09.855
Welcome home,
Lydia.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.657
( sobs )

38:15.494 --> 38:17.663
You got Veil back
safely?

38:20.532 --> 38:22.668
You lied about M.K.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.879
I was trying
to protect him.

38:33.912 --> 38:36.014
From me?

38:36.047 --> 38:38.550
From what you want
to turn him into.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.855
He's not a weapon,
he's a boy.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.891
Tilda,
don't you understand?

38:45.924 --> 38:48.026
I'm the only one
trying to save him.

38:48.059 --> 38:50.095
How did you even know
he existed?

38:52.864 --> 38:55.501
Because I used to be
like M.K.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.035
Special.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.512
Tilda, which bottle
is the tincture?

39:15.421 --> 39:17.989
( wind whistling )

39:43.582 --> 39:46.485
( seagulls squawking )

39:51.690 --> 39:53.625
( door opens )

39:53.659 --> 39:55.093
( groans )

40:17.516 --> 40:20.586
Nobody double-crosses me,
Sunny.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.888
Not even the best Clipper
in the Badlands.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.991
Unlike you,
I'm not a killer.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.226
I'm a trader.

40:28.259 --> 40:32.464
And a man with a talent
like yours

40:32.498 --> 40:35.166
is a very valuable
commodity.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.703
You wanted to leave
the Badlands?

40:38.804 --> 40:40.906
You got your wish.

40:51.983 --> 40:54.520
( door shuts )

40:56.588 --> 40:59.825
( yells )

41:11.269 --> 41:13.772
M.K.'s voice:
There is no easy way
out of the Badlands.

41:15.073 --> 41:17.075
No shortcuts,
no deals.

41:17.108 --> 41:19.044
I know that now.

41:20.946 --> 41:23.248
Maybe Sunny and I
don't deserve redemption.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.953
Maybe my darkness
will never be tamed.

41:29.688 --> 41:32.123
There's only one thing
I know for sure.

41:33.859 --> 41:36.628
The journey
has just begun.

41:55.647 --> 41:58.550
( music playing )
