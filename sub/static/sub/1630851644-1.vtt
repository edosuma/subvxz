WEBVTT

01:07.982 --> 01:09.618
Ah.

02:15.683 --> 02:16.686
Come on.

02:39.974 --> 02:41.043
Look at me.

02:47.682 --> 02:48.884
Where'd he get to?

02:57.793 --> 02:59.528
Where'd he get to?

02:59.561 --> 03:01.029
I don't know.

03:07.101 --> 03:08.670
No!

03:18.880 --> 03:19.881
Get the rope.

03:23.017 --> 03:27.522
We's... headin' east,
towards Indian territory.

03:30.892 --> 03:32.895
He's in a bad way.

03:37.064 --> 03:39.068
Is that everything
you have to say on the matter?

03:39.100 --> 03:41.636
I swear. I swear!

03:42.704 --> 03:43.839
You know what?

03:45.873 --> 03:47.575
I believe you.

03:47.609 --> 03:49.479
Whoa. Duggan.

03:54.716 --> 03:55.716
Whoa.

03:56.784 --> 03:58.020
The hell?

04:03.192 --> 04:05.059
How the hell you figure
this wound up

04:05.093 --> 04:07.530
out here in the middle of
these grassland?

04:09.630 --> 04:11.067
This will work out nice.

04:17.905 --> 04:19.674
Just cut me loose.

04:19.707 --> 04:21.753
You'll never see me again,
honest. Just cut me loose.

04:21.777 --> 04:23.678
Sit on up.

04:23.712 --> 04:25.880
Well, you see,
I would cut you loose,

04:25.914 --> 04:28.584
but that just violates
my sense of what's right.

05:13.928 --> 05:17.032
<i>It can be hard to tell
who and what a man is,</i>

05:17.065 --> 05:19.669
<i>he's got a mind
to convince you otherwise.</i>

05:21.602 --> 05:25.174
<i>My people were from New York,
where I was born.</i>

05:26.207 --> 05:28.109
<i>By the time I was three,</i>

05:28.142 --> 05:31.246
<i>we'd made it to
coffeyville, Kansas,</i>

05:31.279 --> 05:36.251
<i>then down to Arizona,
then new Mexico.</i>

05:36.284 --> 05:39.020
<i>I was in Mexico
proper for a time.</i>

05:41.123 --> 05:43.759
<i>I've tried my hand at
many a vocation.</i>

05:46.628 --> 05:48.897
<i>Some more marginal than others.</i>

05:57.138 --> 06:01.276
<i>Finally, I settled on the life
of a farmer.</i>

06:02.644 --> 06:04.080
<i>Which is what I am.</i>

06:51.025 --> 06:53.861
We got that hog, stock to feed,

06:53.895 --> 06:55.964
and a root cellar to fill.

06:55.998 --> 06:58.700
There's tractors can do this now
in quarter the time.

06:58.734 --> 07:00.702
Is that right?

07:00.736 --> 07:01.803
And here I thought

07:01.837 --> 07:03.906
farming was in
your bones, Wyatt.

07:06.073 --> 07:07.710
This would be a
good place for you

07:07.743 --> 07:09.211
to raise a family of your own.

07:09.243 --> 07:11.880
I know your ma would have
felt that way.

07:11.912 --> 07:13.081
I ain't her.

07:15.250 --> 07:16.652
Or him.

07:16.685 --> 07:19.355
By wisdom is a house built,

07:19.387 --> 07:21.856
and through understanding
is it established.

07:22.724 --> 07:24.827
Through knowledge are
its rooms filled

07:24.859 --> 07:27.061
with rare and
beautiful treasures.

07:27.094 --> 07:30.332
And blessed are those hearts
that are set on pilgrimage.

07:32.267 --> 07:35.303
Much as I'd like to
stick around...

07:35.337 --> 07:37.873
Listen to y'all quote scripture
at each other...

07:38.407 --> 07:39.875
I'm goin' bird huntin'.

07:41.842 --> 07:43.746
Thanks for the help, al.

07:44.412 --> 07:46.181
It does me good to be here.

07:47.748 --> 07:51.621
Makes me feel like I'm still
connected to Marie somehow.

07:52.854 --> 07:54.856
Give your uncle a hand
with his things.

07:54.890 --> 07:57.926
That is, if you've had
sufficient respite.

08:17.178 --> 08:19.113
Thank you, son.

08:19.147 --> 08:20.082
Yes, sir.

08:20.114 --> 08:21.949
Yeah, I wanted to go huntin'
this mornin',

08:21.983 --> 08:24.153
but your pa said he
needed some help.

08:25.152 --> 08:27.222
Sure would like to go with you
one of these days.

08:27.255 --> 08:29.925
I don't think
that'd go over too well.

08:31.792 --> 08:33.395
Your pa's a good man, Wyatt.

08:33.428 --> 08:35.698
I wouldn't let him
marry my sister

08:35.731 --> 08:37.033
if I didn't think so.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.436
Soon enough, you'll be able to

08:41.470 --> 08:44.340
do all the travelin'
and shootin' you want to.

08:45.807 --> 08:47.342
Stop frettin' about it.

09:05.025 --> 09:08.097
We'll take two chops
for supper and smoke the rest.

09:08.797 --> 09:13.101
I ain't got time to render this.
Throw it in the pen.

09:32.386 --> 09:34.489
Don't it bother you sometimes,
they eat their own?

09:35.524 --> 09:37.993
Don't make no
difference to a hog.

09:52.874 --> 09:54.510
Why'd you settle here?

09:54.543 --> 09:56.145
What's that meant to mean?

09:57.411 --> 10:01.750
Why? Why the territory,
of all places?

10:03.351 --> 10:04.820
You could stake a claim,

10:04.852 --> 10:07.021
hang onto it for a year,
it was yours.

10:07.823 --> 10:09.991
Seemed like
a pretty good deal at the time.

10:12.360 --> 10:15.297
Got here before the guns
went off, you know that.

10:16.030 --> 10:18.032
I still don't believe
this is what you wanted.

10:19.568 --> 10:23.539
Up at dawn, feedin' the stock,
workin' the crops.

10:24.539 --> 10:26.275
Hot or cold, rain or shine.

10:26.308 --> 10:29.145
You'll discover
there's worse arrangements.

10:38.119 --> 10:39.455
Pa?

11:20.595 --> 11:22.264
Easy, gal, that's it.

11:24.499 --> 11:26.869
Had me a mare near
just like this

11:26.901 --> 11:28.369
when I wasn't much
older than you.

11:29.236 --> 11:30.371
Lookie here.

11:34.042 --> 11:36.979
What do you think happened?
Some kind of robbery?

11:37.011 --> 11:39.113
- A shootout?
- Shut your nonsense.

11:40.448 --> 11:43.018
I'd best go look for the rider.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.986
Yeah, I'll go saddle up.

11:45.020 --> 11:48.122
You tend to this horse
and stay inside till I get back.

11:48.990 --> 11:51.092
But what if it's trouble, pa?
I can help you.

11:51.125 --> 11:52.928
Go on. Do as I say.

14:01.655 --> 14:02.657
Hello.

15:55.702 --> 15:56.704
Nope.

17:16.316 --> 17:17.316
Wyatt!

17:19.320 --> 17:21.255
- Is he alive?
- Barely.

17:21.288 --> 17:22.323
Was he alone?

17:23.725 --> 17:28.330
No, but I dispatched
with a dozen others was there.

17:28.362 --> 17:29.362
Give me a hand.

17:30.331 --> 17:31.967
He's... he's lost a
lot of blood.

17:40.541 --> 17:42.344
Is he gonna live?

17:42.377 --> 17:44.246
Be up to us, I suppose.

17:44.278 --> 17:46.347
Too far and too late
to fetch the doc.

17:47.047 --> 17:50.584
Well, I can go.
Ride all night if I have to.

17:50.618 --> 17:52.287
I'm sure you would.

17:53.888 --> 17:55.557
So?

17:55.590 --> 17:57.859
You'll stay right here.
Hand over that witch Hazel.

18:05.432 --> 18:07.334
That is an outlaw.

18:07.368 --> 18:09.504
On the run, shot off his horse.

18:10.505 --> 18:11.706
You think he killed somebody?

18:11.738 --> 18:14.442
Wyatt, I know
just as much as you do.

18:15.442 --> 18:16.944
What's that for?

18:16.977 --> 18:19.948
Seal the wound tight
so he don't bleed out overnight.

18:21.381 --> 18:24.919
No! Don't never elevate
the feet with a chest wound.

18:34.329 --> 18:36.031
I've seen the scars
on your body.

18:36.063 --> 18:37.932
'Cause I ain't hid 'em from you.

18:38.932 --> 18:41.669
Now maybe you'll
understand your raisin'.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.038
Put your hand right here.

18:48.876 --> 18:49.811
Where you goin'?

18:49.843 --> 18:52.280
Just keep applyin' pressure
till I get back.

21:40.948 --> 21:42.049
What now?

21:42.082 --> 21:45.519
Bullet's gotta come out.
And he won't make the ride.

21:46.954 --> 21:48.223
Half that rope.

22:01.002 --> 22:02.571
I'll fetch the doc.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.974
You'll stay here
and keep an eye on him.

22:13.147 --> 22:15.183
You really think
that's necessary?

22:15.216 --> 22:17.118
It ain't not necessary.

22:18.151 --> 22:20.153
Now, why don't you
cool his fever

22:20.187 --> 22:21.723
instead of vaporizin' on every

22:21.755 --> 22:23.557
thought that comes
into your head?

22:53.888 --> 22:55.055
Trail's cold.

22:59.627 --> 23:00.629
We'll get him.

23:29.890 --> 23:32.226
That dog could track
a fish through water.

23:35.696 --> 23:36.698
Come on.

23:47.108 --> 23:49.210
He should come to,
you keep your distance.

23:49.243 --> 23:50.912
It don't matter he's tied up.

23:50.945 --> 23:52.647
I can handle myself.

23:52.679 --> 23:55.182
You just do as I say.
I'll be back soon as I can.

23:55.216 --> 23:56.217
Come on.

26:58.265 --> 26:59.434
Where's Billy at?

27:10.276 --> 27:13.280
<i>Keep your head down.
You'll be all right.</i>

28:25.351 --> 28:26.353
Whoa.

29:38.057 --> 29:39.259
He was here.

29:42.062 --> 29:43.664
Don't look like it to me.

29:52.605 --> 29:55.342
If I'm right, he weren't alone.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.616
Whoever it is knows
what he's doin'.

30:05.451 --> 30:08.221
Covered his tracks as good
as anyone I've run across.

30:09.055 --> 30:11.359
Weren't for this rain,
I'd have found him sooner.

30:12.226 --> 30:14.996
I don't need you
to speechify the inner workings

30:15.028 --> 30:17.097
in your halfwit canine mind.

30:18.332 --> 30:19.967
I need to know where
he's headed.

30:25.104 --> 30:27.307
Well, that don't exactly
narrow it down.

32:16.617 --> 32:18.086
Where am I?

32:24.423 --> 32:25.492
Who the hell are you?

32:26.627 --> 32:29.263
M-My pa found you,
close to dead.

32:29.295 --> 32:30.764
He brought you back here.

32:30.796 --> 32:32.432
Oh, yeah?

32:32.466 --> 32:34.200
Who's your pa?

32:34.234 --> 32:35.236
Nobody. Uh...

32:35.669 --> 32:37.338
Henry. Just a-a farmer.

32:50.449 --> 32:52.285
What, it's only you
and him here?

32:54.921 --> 32:56.256
He here now?

32:59.659 --> 33:00.794
He's just out back.

33:03.463 --> 33:05.133
Tendin' to the hogs.

33:06.967 --> 33:08.268
Oh, yeah?

33:12.471 --> 33:13.640
Well, go fetch him.

33:27.955 --> 33:29.689
Quit mov... moving!

33:31.291 --> 33:32.668
Right now, I don't
want to hurt you.

33:32.692 --> 33:34.360
I don't want to hurt you.
Stop moving!

33:34.393 --> 33:37.297
Where'd you put my gun
and my satchel? Listen to me!

33:37.331 --> 33:38.808
I don't know what
you're talkin' about, mister.

33:38.832 --> 33:39.766
Don't you lie to me!

33:39.800 --> 33:42.169
What'd you do
with my gun and my satchel?

34:09.896 --> 34:11.365
Pa!

34:15.334 --> 34:17.503
How'd he get loose?

34:17.537 --> 34:18.739
H-He wriggled free.

34:19.439 --> 34:20.874
Wriggled free?

34:20.907 --> 34:23.878
And got hold of my knife
I left on the bedstand.

34:24.977 --> 34:26.847
Well, that's on the both of us.

34:27.881 --> 34:30.484
Help me tie the son of a
bitch back up.

34:59.912 --> 35:00.914
Okay.

35:02.916 --> 35:05.785
You better think long and hard
on what you got yourself into.

35:05.818 --> 35:08.655
Funny, I was about
to tell you the same thing.

35:11.390 --> 35:12.927
What you aimin' to do with that?

35:13.793 --> 35:16.663
Gonna dig that
bullet out of you,

35:16.697 --> 35:18.765
maybe get some answers
in the process.

35:19.465 --> 35:21.034
I like what I hear,

35:21.068 --> 35:24.372
I might be inclined to give you
something to ease the pain.

35:30.010 --> 35:32.912
No.

35:33.914 --> 35:34.948
No!

35:35.948 --> 35:37.784
Okay! Listen, listen!

35:37.818 --> 35:39.453
No!

35:39.485 --> 35:41.621
Let's start with you
tellin' me who you are.

35:41.655 --> 35:44.457
I'm law! I'm a goddamn lawman!

35:45.559 --> 35:48.495
He ain't no lawman, pa,
he was fixin' to kill me.

35:48.528 --> 35:49.963
Ready for some whisky?

35:49.996 --> 35:52.566
I just told you... I'm law.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.369
Ask him about the money.

35:57.570 --> 35:58.872
What money?

35:59.606 --> 36:00.841
He asked me about it.

36:01.941 --> 36:03.776
Listen. Listen to me.

36:03.809 --> 36:04.811
Okay, listen.

36:05.979 --> 36:07.923
What's a shot lawman doin'
with a satchel full of cash?

36:07.947 --> 36:09.682
Listen!

36:09.715 --> 36:11.684
Listen! If you got a
brain in your head,

36:11.718 --> 36:13.553
you need to get
yourself and your boy

36:13.586 --> 36:15.021
out of here fast as you can.

36:15.055 --> 36:16.490
You hear me?

36:21.595 --> 36:22.629
No.

36:22.662 --> 36:24.765
Oh, no! No, no!

36:40.680 --> 36:42.116
At least we know you won't die

36:42.148 --> 36:44.451
'fore I find out what I
want to know.

36:51.825 --> 36:52.960
Oh god.

36:56.496 --> 36:57.831
Let me have a little more.

36:57.863 --> 36:59.932
Let me...

37:03.570 --> 37:04.572
Riders.

37:09.543 --> 37:12.579
Come on, cut me loose.
Come on, cut me loose.

37:14.780 --> 37:17.517
Listen, they gon' be
three of 'em.

37:18.517 --> 37:21.421
One's a Mexican.

37:21.454 --> 37:23.890
The other's an ugly
son of a bitch

37:23.923 --> 37:25.626
with a thick beard.

37:25.659 --> 37:26.794
And their leader...

37:28.028 --> 37:30.173
Their leader looks like a man
you don't want to mess with.

37:30.197 --> 37:32.465
And believe me, you don't.

37:32.499 --> 37:34.034
Keep back from the window.

37:35.535 --> 37:37.180
If you want to live,
you gotta turn me loose

37:37.204 --> 37:38.472
and give me my gun, hear?

37:39.738 --> 37:40.773
He's lyin'.

37:40.807 --> 37:42.810
I said keep back.

37:42.843 --> 37:43.911
Go on.

38:38.798 --> 38:40.100
Can I help you?

38:40.733 --> 38:42.268
I'm sheriff Sam ketchum.

38:42.302 --> 38:44.004
These here are my deputies.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.907
We've been scoutin'
for a man on the run.

38:46.939 --> 38:49.476
Lately goes by the
name of curry.

38:50.543 --> 38:51.845
Been shot.

38:52.711 --> 38:56.516
Six foot, brown hair,
said to be handsome,

38:56.550 --> 38:58.051
though most would
want him credited

38:58.084 --> 38:59.153
for nothing but devilry.

39:01.287 --> 39:04.724
What I do know is,
he's dangerous.

39:05.224 --> 39:07.760
You seen anybody around here
answers that description?

39:08.628 --> 39:12.131
Say you're a sheriff?
How's it I don't recognize you?

39:12.731 --> 39:14.735
We're from way over
in woods county.

39:15.834 --> 39:17.145
Now, this curry we're
looking for,

39:17.169 --> 39:18.639
he's got a warrant on him there

39:18.671 --> 39:20.840
in Missouri and Tennessee.

39:21.707 --> 39:24.043
Might also claim he's the law.

39:24.744 --> 39:26.780
He's got a history of
such chicanery.

39:27.646 --> 39:30.851
Far from it. He's a killer.

39:30.883 --> 39:32.619
He will kill again.

39:35.155 --> 39:36.256
You're not fixin' to shoot

39:36.289 --> 39:38.057
any of us with that pistol,
are you?

39:39.726 --> 39:41.794
So far I got no reason to.

39:43.128 --> 39:44.130
That's good news.

39:47.300 --> 39:52.238
You'll want to think 'fore you
raise that thing up, farmer.

39:52.271 --> 39:54.674
Nothing to be
worried about here, friend.

39:54.707 --> 39:57.211
Just a little project
I'm working on, that's all.

39:59.613 --> 40:01.181
How many people live out here?

40:02.948 --> 40:04.351
What difference is that to you?

40:04.383 --> 40:07.353
I'm trying to make sure
you're safe, is all.

40:07.387 --> 40:09.122
Wouldn't seem to be
your business,

40:09.155 --> 40:11.758
seeing as how you're
from woods county.

40:12.925 --> 40:14.927
You married?

40:14.961 --> 40:16.664
Saw a grave over there.

40:19.064 --> 40:20.066
My wife.

40:20.967 --> 40:23.970
Died ten years back
from tuberculosis.

40:26.106 --> 40:27.174
My condolences.

40:29.675 --> 40:31.210
Horrible way to go.

40:31.244 --> 40:33.713
Tell 'em, pa. Tell 'em!

40:33.747 --> 40:36.250
Marie hobbs mccarty,
the marker said.

40:36.983 --> 40:39.052
Your last name mccarty?

40:39.084 --> 40:40.119
That's right.

40:41.220 --> 40:42.590
First name?

40:46.358 --> 40:47.627
Henry.

40:49.996 --> 40:51.932
So hobbs was her people,
I'm guessing.

40:52.698 --> 40:55.302
'Cause I noticed a hobbs ranch
to the east of here.

40:55.334 --> 40:56.603
Her brothers.

40:57.704 --> 40:58.738
Uh-huh.

41:01.006 --> 41:02.246
Well, from the looks of things,

41:02.275 --> 41:04.010
you've been out here a
good many years.

41:06.246 --> 41:07.615
Nice situation.

41:08.414 --> 41:10.750
All nestled up here
in the hills.

41:10.784 --> 41:12.218
Hard to see from a distance.

41:13.419 --> 41:16.657
What's any of this got to do
with the man you're lookin' for?

41:17.756 --> 41:19.159
Not much, I'll Grant you.

41:22.695 --> 41:24.398
Long time ago, uh...

41:24.430 --> 41:29.035
Was a fella caused some trouble
down Arizona, new Mexico way.

41:30.035 --> 41:31.838
Heard he went by the
name mccarty.

41:33.939 --> 41:35.842
I was wondering if he
might be your kin.

41:36.910 --> 41:39.313
You got the wrong
pig by the ear.

41:40.113 --> 41:41.014
Meaning?

41:41.048 --> 41:44.818
I don't know no mccartys
anywhere but here,

41:44.851 --> 41:46.919
and all my kin is deceased.

41:48.755 --> 41:50.756
Now I got chores to tend to

41:50.789 --> 41:53.392
and scant wood to
cook my supper.

41:53.425 --> 41:56.028
I ain't seen the man
you're after.

41:56.061 --> 41:58.031
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

41:58.865 --> 42:00.700
Be sure to alert the
good sheriff

42:00.733 --> 42:02.936
in chickasha if I should
run across him.

42:06.305 --> 42:07.307
Well, then.

42:08.742 --> 42:09.943
I thank you for your help.

42:12.445 --> 42:14.414
Looks like another dead end,
boys.

42:16.950 --> 42:18.952
You be sure to lock your
doors tonight.

42:21.820 --> 42:22.956
Stay safe.

42:26.825 --> 42:27.927
Come on.

42:50.082 --> 42:51.851
Now you're inclined to
hang onto that?

42:51.885 --> 42:53.129
I thought you might be needin'
help.

42:53.153 --> 42:54.921
You wanna tell me how
this got fired?

42:55.854 --> 42:57.157
Honest, pa.

42:57.189 --> 42:58.325
Don't you lie to me!

42:59.526 --> 43:02.229
I wanted to know what it's like.

43:02.262 --> 43:07.033
I am the only boy for 50 miles
that's never fired one.

43:07.066 --> 43:09.401
You won't even let me
lay hand on your old shotgun.

43:09.434 --> 43:13.105
So if you can't teach me proper,
I gotta do it myself.

43:13.139 --> 43:17.477
You get into my things again,
I will crack your crust!

43:19.211 --> 43:22.248
You're a stupid,
worthless old man.

43:22.881 --> 43:25.217
A whole life, and nothin'
to show for it

43:25.251 --> 43:26.887
but this rundown old farm

43:26.919 --> 43:28.954
and a boy who's gonna
leave you alone to die

43:28.988 --> 43:30.858
as soon as he's able.

43:43.436 --> 43:44.771
Let me guess.

43:45.238 --> 43:46.907
You gon' tell me that he ain't

43:46.939 --> 43:49.075
the sheriff of woods county,
you are.

43:49.108 --> 43:51.544
They ain't lawmen,
they're bank robbers.

43:51.577 --> 43:53.780
Well, what's left of them,
anyway.

43:55.914 --> 43:59.084
Knocked over the Adams express.

43:59.117 --> 44:01.153
Me and my deputies gave chase,
killed two of 'em,

44:01.186 --> 44:02.564
including the one
carrying the loot.

44:02.588 --> 44:04.523
Bank robbers wearin' badges?

44:04.557 --> 44:06.193
That they took off
me and my men.

44:07.193 --> 44:08.928
He's the one
impersonating the law.

44:10.630 --> 44:12.332
But you made off with the money.

44:14.267 --> 44:15.469
Hell, yeah, I grabbed it.

44:17.202 --> 44:20.006
Then why ain't you back with it
in woods county?

44:20.472 --> 44:24.076
Oh, I don't know.
Why does it look like?

44:27.213 --> 44:28.281
And my first priority was

44:28.314 --> 44:30.050
getting away from
that bunch alive.

44:30.082 --> 44:32.122
That's why I rode like hell
till I couldn't no more.

44:32.619 --> 44:34.153
There's the last thing
I remembered,

44:34.186 --> 44:35.488
till I woke up here.

44:37.456 --> 44:38.566
Look, I know what I'm saying

44:38.590 --> 44:40.125
sounds ridiculous to
you and all.

44:40.159 --> 44:41.361
That it does.

44:41.394 --> 44:42.896
Why they didn't shoot you dead

44:42.928 --> 44:44.497
on the spot just now,
I don't know.

44:45.497 --> 44:47.200
But I can guarantee you...

44:48.334 --> 44:49.903
They'll be back.

45:44.289 --> 45:46.191
Only thing I can't figure

45:46.224 --> 45:47.259
is why the old man

45:47.293 --> 45:49.463
would risk his neck
for a stranger.

45:50.162 --> 45:52.231
Maybe he got offered a
cut of the money.

45:53.633 --> 45:55.302
Something tells me
that ain't it.

45:57.570 --> 45:59.439
Any one of us could have
taken him out.

46:00.405 --> 46:02.241
Which is what we should do now.

46:02.275 --> 46:06.113
- Ride up, finish it.
- Not just yet.

46:09.448 --> 46:11.651
'Cause of some shaky old farmer?

46:11.684 --> 46:15.421
He didn't hold that pistol
like any farmer I've ever seen.

46:16.421 --> 46:18.190
There are three of us.

46:19.224 --> 46:22.394
We don't run up in a bank,
or ride up on a stage

46:22.427 --> 46:23.930
without knowing who's in it.

46:24.430 --> 46:27.400
We know curry's in there.
With our money!

46:27.432 --> 46:29.101
Which is why you're
going to reconnoiter

46:29.135 --> 46:31.537
that so-called farmer's place

46:31.570 --> 46:33.305
and make sure curry
don't skedaddle.

46:33.338 --> 46:35.207
Gladly.

46:36.608 --> 46:38.678
Don't make a move till
we get there.

46:40.345 --> 46:41.345
Fine.

46:42.782 --> 46:45.052
- Duggan.
- I said fine.

46:53.093 --> 46:56.262
Come sunup, you and me
will head into chickasha,

46:56.294 --> 46:57.563
hire some guns.

46:58.363 --> 46:59.599
Understood.

47:01.133 --> 47:05.104
On the way, we'll pay a call
on farmer hobbs...

47:05.738 --> 47:07.674
Find out if he's got
anything interesting

47:07.706 --> 47:10.576
to tell us about ol'
Henry mccarty.

48:12.438 --> 48:15.175
Wyatt. Come on in.

48:17.142 --> 48:19.512
- I'm almost finished.
- Leave it till morning.

48:21.847 --> 48:22.847
Come on.

48:53.613 --> 48:56.582
It'd be a damn sight easier
if I could feed myself.

48:59.452 --> 49:02.222
Be a damn sight easier
not to feed you at all.

49:18.905 --> 49:21.775
- You and me ever met?
- That I'd remember.

49:24.644 --> 49:26.213
How long you been a sheriff?

49:30.383 --> 49:35.255
- I'd say onto 18 years now.
- How'd you get your start?

49:36.189 --> 49:38.191
I was a deputy for big
bill Thompson

49:38.224 --> 49:39.258
in Baxter Springs.

49:40.193 --> 49:44.296
Baxter Springs.
Baxter Springs, Missouri?

49:45.664 --> 49:49.235
- Kansas.
- Skinny fella, big ears?

49:51.604 --> 49:52.872
Heavyset.

49:52.905 --> 49:54.841
Missing part of his
left ear from

49:54.874 --> 49:57.343
a drunk miner taking a
potshot at him.

49:57.376 --> 50:00.814
- I heard it was a drunk whore.
- Oh, you did?

50:03.548 --> 50:05.751
Which part of Baxter Springs
you live in?

50:07.619 --> 50:11.356
A boarding house.
Out near Grant's stage station.

50:11.389 --> 50:13.159
What was the landlady's name?

50:14.693 --> 50:16.529
She weren't no lady.

50:18.231 --> 50:20.534
She a nasty ol' cuss
named Hannah.

50:23.235 --> 50:25.904
You ever run into a
George crook?

50:25.938 --> 50:28.307
You mean general George?

50:28.840 --> 50:30.275
Sumbitch dedicated his life

50:30.309 --> 50:32.445
to driving the caddo out
of the territory.

50:50.963 --> 50:53.867
How in the hell did you end up
in Baxter Springs?

50:55.735 --> 50:57.903
Well, like every other fool

50:57.936 --> 51:00.272
dreaming of easy riches
and digging for tin.

51:00.972 --> 51:02.608
Till I realized there
weren't none.

51:03.409 --> 51:04.953
Just a bunch of ghost stories
about a mine

51:04.977 --> 51:06.579
near smokey hill river.

51:06.611 --> 51:09.215
Then I... I was broke.
Work was hard to come by.

51:09.615 --> 51:11.751
I'm lucky big bill took
a liking to me.

51:11.784 --> 51:15.354
Otherwise I... I don't know
what would have come of me.

51:18.758 --> 51:21.461
I... I'm sorry I jumped
your boy before.

51:23.296 --> 51:25.865
I woke up in a strange place,
didn't know who he was...

51:26.499 --> 51:29.002
I was being held hostage
in some hideout.

51:29.035 --> 51:31.371
This look like a hideout to you?

51:33.905 --> 51:35.909
I overheard what he
said earlier.

51:36.909 --> 51:38.644
He didn't mean any of that.

51:40.512 --> 51:41.614
Yes, he did.

51:58.097 --> 52:02.401
I'll give you one hand free.
Don't make me take it off.

52:02.834 --> 52:03.869
All right.

52:09.642 --> 52:11.011
All right.

52:30.963 --> 52:32.798
Was farming what your daddy did?

52:33.798 --> 52:37.303
My daddy died when I was 3,
up in Kansas.

52:38.104 --> 52:40.774
And he did near everything
but work the land.

52:42.140 --> 52:43.976
I was orphaned at 15.

52:45.711 --> 52:47.981
That's 13 years longer
than I knew my folks.

52:49.447 --> 52:51.817
Ah. Whereabouts you grow up?

52:53.852 --> 52:54.854
New Mexico.

52:56.454 --> 52:58.490
- Which part?
- Fort Sumner.

52:58.523 --> 53:00.326
Born and raised.
You heard of it?

53:05.430 --> 53:07.499
Where Billy the kid was shot,
wasn't it?

53:09.802 --> 53:11.604
Main reason anyone know it.

53:17.041 --> 53:18.877
I was there the night
it happened.

53:22.615 --> 53:23.950
How's that?

53:23.983 --> 53:25.985
I was just a boy.

53:26.017 --> 53:27.162
I used to make what
money I could

53:27.186 --> 53:30.622
doing chores for a fella
by the name of Peter Maxwell.

53:31.122 --> 53:33.892
Same Peter Maxwell
put the kid up for the night.

53:33.925 --> 53:35.660
Same Peter Maxwell
tipped off Garrett

53:35.693 --> 53:37.462
and his deputies, poe
and mckinney,

53:37.496 --> 53:39.131
the kid was holed up there.

53:39.164 --> 53:40.832
I was sweeping the stalls.

53:40.865 --> 53:43.469
When I saw Garrett walk in
the house, I...

53:44.035 --> 53:45.438
I don't think nothing of it.

53:46.905 --> 53:50.409
But Billy wasn't in there.
Not then, leastways.

53:50.443 --> 53:52.445
- Know how I know?
- How?

53:52.477 --> 53:54.046
He was barefoot
in his shin sleeves,

53:54.079 --> 53:55.747
cutting the meat off
a deer carcass

53:55.780 --> 53:57.616
not 20 feet from where
I was working.

54:02.188 --> 54:03.956
I saw him peer through
the barn door,

54:03.988 --> 54:06.392
and he saw poe and mckinney
on the porch there.

54:07.726 --> 54:10.530
He stopped carving,
looked me dead in my eye.

54:10.563 --> 54:14.166
He said, "keep your head down,
you'll be all right."

54:15.800 --> 54:17.669
So Billy went straight to
Maxwell's room,

54:17.702 --> 54:20.407
realized pretty quick
it ain't just Maxwell in there.

54:22.073 --> 54:25.544
He called out,
<i>"¿quien es? ¿quien es?"</i>

54:25.577 --> 54:27.880
'Cause Billy spoke Spanish
as good as a Mexican.

54:29.048 --> 54:30.917
Pat's answer?

54:31.684 --> 54:35.955
Two shots. One wide of the Mark,
and the other one in the chest.

54:40.659 --> 54:42.428
That was the end of
Billy the kid.

54:45.764 --> 54:47.633
And you seen it all.

54:47.666 --> 54:49.035
I most certainly did.

54:49.068 --> 54:50.870
Saw the kid's body get
hauled off too,

54:50.903 --> 54:52.105
wrapped in a bloody sheet.

54:53.972 --> 54:55.907
Enough to teach me
that ain't no life for me.

54:55.941 --> 54:58.845
I'd rather stop this crazy
than be part of it anyway.

55:24.235 --> 55:25.637
Well...

55:25.671 --> 55:27.173
Damn.

55:27.206 --> 55:29.041
If I knew all it took
was a good story

55:29.073 --> 55:30.276
for you to cut me loose.

55:33.012 --> 55:35.548
You well enough to stay upright
in the saddle?

55:37.615 --> 55:39.885
- Not hardly.
- I want you out of here.

55:40.686 --> 55:43.122
I suppose waiting till sunup
ain't an option?

55:43.155 --> 55:45.658
If I was alone out here,
it'd be different.

55:46.291 --> 55:47.893
Well, then, I guess I'm ready.

55:50.061 --> 55:51.061
Good.

55:54.767 --> 55:55.767
Take it.

56:01.573 --> 56:02.775
I'll fetch your loot.

56:38.343 --> 56:40.146
- Pa?
- Wyatt! Get down!

56:43.749 --> 56:44.817
I-I think I'm all right.

56:46.952 --> 56:47.986
Is... is he hit?

56:55.693 --> 56:58.230
He just passed out.
Give me that.

56:59.365 --> 57:01.100
I'm better with it
than you think.

57:01.133 --> 57:03.002
Not until I teach you proper.

57:03.035 --> 57:04.837
- I've taught myself - shush.

57:06.372 --> 57:07.840
Now, where'd you get to?

57:15.079 --> 57:16.615
- He's under the house.
- Shh.

57:50.282 --> 57:52.151
I hope you got
good enough with this.

57:54.153 --> 57:56.255
God forbid it happens,
but shooting a man

57:56.287 --> 57:58.323
is different than
hitting a target...

57:58.356 --> 58:00.793
A line you can't
cross back over.

58:00.825 --> 58:01.626
I know that.

58:01.660 --> 58:03.329
You couldn't until
you've done it.

58:05.430 --> 58:06.798
If he comes in here...

58:07.832 --> 58:09.101
You pull that trigger.

58:10.869 --> 58:12.238
Aim for the chest.

58:12.271 --> 58:15.173
And keep firing
until you hit it.

58:38.764 --> 58:40.932
Where you going?

58:55.814 --> 58:57.183
Son of a bitch!

58:57.816 --> 58:58.951
Cocksucker!

58:59.418 --> 59:01.186
Fuck.

59:08.459 --> 59:09.961
Shit.

59:38.923 --> 59:42.227
Where's the others? They close?

59:42.260 --> 59:43.496
Go to hell.

59:44.896 --> 59:46.331
I've been here too often to let

59:46.365 --> 59:49.334
a man of your caliber
overhaul my baggage.

59:51.269 --> 59:54.072
Answer me, or it ends for
you right now.

59:55.474 --> 59:57.075
Go to hell, you bastard.

1:00:57.035 --> 1:00:58.871
He was fixin' to kill us both.

1:01:01.472 --> 1:01:02.541
I saw.

1:01:03.876 --> 1:01:06.078
Probably here to watch
and got greedy.

1:01:07.178 --> 1:01:09.182
The others will be coming.

1:01:12.383 --> 1:01:14.486
First thing, we gotta get rid
of this body.

1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:16.389
How we gonna do that?

1:01:22.494 --> 1:01:23.930
We ain't.

1:02:22.521 --> 1:02:24.523
I know it don't feel like it.

1:02:25.323 --> 1:02:27.425
You're lucky it just grazed ya.

1:02:31.697 --> 1:02:34.233
If you know I found that gun,

1:02:34.265 --> 1:02:36.903
you know I saw what's
in the back of that closet.

1:02:39.371 --> 1:02:40.371
Who are you?

1:02:42.506 --> 1:02:43.642
I'm who I am.

1:02:45.242 --> 1:02:48.146
Aren't you always preaching
about being honest?

1:02:48.713 --> 1:02:50.615
The truth will set you free?

1:02:53.318 --> 1:02:54.921
I've never lied to you.

1:03:03.662 --> 1:03:05.297
Isn't not telling me
the whole story

1:03:05.329 --> 1:03:06.564
the same damn thing?

1:03:12.604 --> 1:03:15.408
I've done things
I wish I could take back.

1:03:16.307 --> 1:03:19.077
A long time before you.
Before your ma.

1:03:20.611 --> 1:03:23.182
Things that
you got no business hearing.

1:03:24.316 --> 1:03:27.453
How am I supposed to respect you
if you ain't respecting me?

1:03:27.485 --> 1:03:29.487
I am respecting you.

1:03:30.722 --> 1:03:32.457
And if you don't
understand that,

1:03:32.490 --> 1:03:34.360
you ain't heard a
word I just said.

1:03:35.494 --> 1:03:39.064
No, I heard it. I just
don't believe a bit of it.

1:04:16.267 --> 1:04:17.403
<i>Keep your head down.</i>

1:04:21.639 --> 1:04:25.209
Keep your head down.
You'll be all right.

1:04:25.242 --> 1:04:26.277
<i>You'll be all right.</i>

1:06:25.329 --> 1:06:26.764
Whoa.

1:06:34.905 --> 1:06:36.674
- Morning - morning.

1:06:37.809 --> 1:06:40.678
- Something I can help you with?
- I sure hope so.

1:06:42.247 --> 1:06:45.851
Nice place you got here.
Peaceful. Quiet.

1:06:48.419 --> 1:06:49.521
Bird hunting.

1:06:50.454 --> 1:06:52.757
Nothing quite like the
flush of the bevy.

1:06:54.659 --> 1:06:56.162
You must be quite the shot.

1:06:58.563 --> 1:06:59.664
Do what I can.

1:07:00.664 --> 1:07:01.833
I envy you.

1:07:03.300 --> 1:07:04.503
I don't get to go out hunting

1:07:04.535 --> 1:07:05.938
as much as I'd like
to these days.

1:07:07.439 --> 1:07:08.919
Something I can help
you with, mister?

1:07:11.508 --> 1:07:13.411
My daddy used to hunt pheasant.

1:07:13.979 --> 1:07:16.448
It was always
my damn job to clean 'em.

1:07:18.316 --> 1:07:21.387
Oh, cutting the skin on
the breast, peeling it back.

1:07:22.988 --> 1:07:25.424
But over time, I
figured the best way

1:07:25.456 --> 1:07:27.458
to get rid of their innards...

1:07:28.593 --> 1:07:32.464
Was to split the bird's back.
Get to 'em that way.

1:07:35.467 --> 1:07:36.767
Is that what you find?

1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:38.203
Look, I don't...

1:07:38.769 --> 1:07:40.605
Mean to be UN-neighborly, but...

1:07:41.006 --> 1:07:43.642
But get to the point? Sure.

1:07:45.876 --> 1:07:47.979
I wanted to ask you a
couple questions about, uh,

1:07:48.012 --> 1:07:49.914
your brother-in-law.

1:07:51.582 --> 1:07:53.351
Well, what concern is
he of yours?

1:07:54.485 --> 1:07:56.221
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

1:07:57.354 --> 1:07:59.457
You see, I got this
crazy idea...

1:08:00.457 --> 1:08:01.860
There might be more to ol'
mccarty

1:08:01.892 --> 1:08:02.892
than meets the eye.

1:08:03.996 --> 1:08:05.916
You supposed be some
kind of lawman or something?

1:08:06.564 --> 1:08:08.300
Something like that.

1:08:09.367 --> 1:08:10.970
Well, I think it's
time you left.

1:08:11.735 --> 1:08:13.771
Well, we came here for
some answers.

1:08:15.807 --> 1:08:17.876
We ain't leaving till I get 'em.

1:08:17.909 --> 1:08:19.245
That so?

1:08:23.881 --> 1:08:25.517
I should...

1:08:30.054 --> 1:08:33.291
Now how the hell
we gonna pick his ass up?

1:08:42.733 --> 1:08:45.903
Okay. Okay, thank you.

1:09:00.384 --> 1:09:02.486
Oh, god. Okay.

1:09:02.519 --> 1:09:06.057
I'm no good to travel. I'm not.

1:09:07.726 --> 1:09:09.428
You take the boy,
you get out of here.

1:09:10.661 --> 1:09:11.838
When ketchum and his men arrive,

1:09:11.862 --> 1:09:13.499
I'll hold them off as
long as I can.

1:09:14.398 --> 1:09:16.035
- The hell with that!
- Wyatt.

1:09:17.035 --> 1:09:18.671
We got guns.

1:09:19.403 --> 1:09:21.473
You already killed one of
them barehanded.

1:09:21.505 --> 1:09:24.375
Fill a pack. We're leaving.

1:09:25.910 --> 1:09:27.579
I'm warning you.

1:09:55.005 --> 1:09:56.508
He's back.

1:10:06.550 --> 1:10:07.384
Leave the rest.

1:10:07.419 --> 1:10:09.521
We can't just leave
him here to die.

1:10:09.554 --> 1:10:10.856
I am damn sure not
gonna lose you

1:10:10.888 --> 1:10:12.656
over something that
ain't our fight.

1:10:12.689 --> 1:10:13.892
Your pa's right.

1:10:13.924 --> 1:10:15.826
I am old enough to make
my own decisions,

1:10:15.860 --> 1:10:17.829
whether you are ready
to accept that or not.

1:10:17.862 --> 1:10:20.565
Yeah. This is mine to finish.

1:10:20.598 --> 1:10:22.034
Go on, now. I'll be all right.

1:10:54.531 --> 1:10:55.531
Whoa.

1:10:59.170 --> 1:11:02.640
Curry! Anybody home?

1:11:04.075 --> 1:11:06.077
You gentlemen need something?

1:11:07.077 --> 1:11:08.914
We're here for our fugitive.

1:11:09.546 --> 1:11:11.784
I told you yesterday
I ain't seen him.

1:11:12.983 --> 1:11:15.653
My intuition tells
me that's not true.

1:11:17.088 --> 1:11:18.790
I'll make it easy...

1:11:18.822 --> 1:11:21.927
You hand him over,
we let you and the boy go free.

1:11:23.193 --> 1:11:26.531
The other option is,
we take him.

1:11:26.563 --> 1:11:28.133
And you and the boy die.

1:11:29.567 --> 1:11:31.636
You take that deal.

1:11:31.669 --> 1:11:33.572
I signed up for this,
you didn't.

1:11:38.242 --> 1:11:40.611
See your horses
are already saddled.

1:11:40.644 --> 1:11:42.848
You can just ride on
out of here.

1:11:47.852 --> 1:11:49.621
You and I both know
we'll be dead

1:11:49.653 --> 1:11:50.988
before we mount our horses.

1:11:54.224 --> 1:11:57.562
'Fore this turns
into some kinda brigasee,

1:11:57.594 --> 1:11:59.798
why don't me and you
settle this,

1:11:59.830 --> 1:12:01.098
knuckle and skull.

1:12:04.001 --> 1:12:06.205
You got a lot of fight
for a farmer.

1:12:07.272 --> 1:12:09.140
That ain't the way
this plays out.

1:12:11.209 --> 1:12:12.478
Bring him up!

1:12:25.089 --> 1:12:26.158
Al?

1:12:52.183 --> 1:12:54.052
Listen to me. What's
gonna happen

1:12:54.085 --> 1:12:55.220
will happen quick.

1:12:55.253 --> 1:12:58.255
I'll stall long as I can,
but I want you to sneak out back

1:12:58.289 --> 1:13:00.125
and hole up at Roger's mill...

1:13:00.157 --> 1:13:01.660
And wait for me there.

1:13:02.059 --> 1:13:04.094
Only use this if you have to.

1:13:04.128 --> 1:13:06.164
- Let me fight.
- I can't do this right

1:13:06.196 --> 1:13:07.998
if I'm worried about
protecting you.

1:13:08.031 --> 1:13:09.634
Just turn me over.

1:13:10.602 --> 1:13:12.571
You don't, they're gonna
kill us all.

1:13:12.603 --> 1:13:13.371
You and me both know

1:13:13.405 --> 1:13:15.005
they're fixin' to do
that anyway.

1:13:15.039 --> 1:13:17.643
And yet you expect me
to run out into sure gunfire?

1:13:18.076 --> 1:13:19.177
Your boy's right.

1:13:25.116 --> 1:13:26.618
Stay inside.

1:13:26.651 --> 1:13:28.687
Stay away from the window.

1:13:28.719 --> 1:13:31.222
You have to shoot,
aim for the chest, and...

1:13:31.254 --> 1:13:32.957
Keep firing till I
hit something.

1:13:50.974 --> 1:13:52.177
I've had some suspicions

1:13:52.210 --> 1:13:54.580
about who you are,
Henry mccarty.

1:13:57.080 --> 1:14:01.586
I got to admit, that name
sticks in me like a Thorn.

1:14:01.986 --> 1:14:04.256
My curiosity was aroused.

1:14:05.756 --> 1:14:08.259
I was hoping al here
might shed some light.

1:14:09.994 --> 1:14:11.830
He wouldn't say shit.

1:14:12.830 --> 1:14:14.933
Even after my boys were...

1:14:14.965 --> 1:14:18.769
What's the word?
Uh, emphatic in their question.

1:14:21.004 --> 1:14:23.074
You probably
concluded I'm no sheriff.

1:14:24.008 --> 1:14:26.010
Nor are these men my deputies.

1:14:27.077 --> 1:14:28.847
Not a one of us had spent time

1:14:28.879 --> 1:14:31.015
in woods county
before a month ago.

1:14:32.416 --> 1:14:33.619
What about you?

1:14:35.018 --> 1:14:36.354
Where'd you come from?

1:14:37.421 --> 1:14:39.924
Every place on earth but this.

1:14:42.826 --> 1:14:44.094
So be it.

1:14:44.128 --> 1:14:45.296
Last offer.

1:14:47.165 --> 1:14:48.900
This tongue-tied piece of shit

1:14:48.933 --> 1:14:50.769
for sheriff curry in there
and the money.

1:14:51.268 --> 1:14:52.704
You get what you want.

1:14:53.103 --> 1:14:54.305
I get what I want.

1:14:54.972 --> 1:14:57.942
We go our separate ways
without blood spilled.

1:14:58.976 --> 1:15:01.713
Not yours, not mine.

1:15:02.245 --> 1:15:04.148
Not that boy of yours I
see surveilling

1:15:04.182 --> 1:15:05.751
all this through that window.

1:15:08.018 --> 1:15:09.186
If I wanted bloodshed,

1:15:09.219 --> 1:15:12.156
I'd have busted in there guns
a-blazin' a long time ago.

1:15:13.491 --> 1:15:15.127
I believe you know that.

1:15:15.860 --> 1:15:18.863
You leave my brother-in-law
right where he is.

1:15:19.731 --> 1:15:22.901
Turn and ride your asses
off my property.

1:15:22.933 --> 1:15:26.137
You do that, and I'll
let you live.

1:15:30.474 --> 1:15:32.376
You hear that, fellas?

1:15:32.410 --> 1:15:35.046
Is that the talk of a
mild old sodbuster?

1:15:35.079 --> 1:15:37.081
I think not.

1:15:38.348 --> 1:15:39.351
Nah.

1:15:40.285 --> 1:15:42.688
That sounds like
something else altogether.

1:15:44.187 --> 1:15:45.187
Hobbs!

1:15:46.290 --> 1:15:49.093
Anything you could tell me
might change the equation here?

1:15:52.229 --> 1:15:55.467
Kiss my ass,
you long-winded son of a bitch.

1:15:58.803 --> 1:16:01.773
You got a pair, I'll
give you that.

1:16:05.375 --> 1:16:06.811
Last chance, al.

1:16:10.214 --> 1:16:15.954
You have no idea the hell storm
you fixin' to let loose.

1:16:18.990 --> 1:16:20.992
Consider me properly warned.

1:16:27.799 --> 1:16:30.402
Easy. Whoa.

1:16:33.870 --> 1:16:35.005
Easy, fella.

1:16:42.412 --> 1:16:44.950
Goddamn.

1:16:46.317 --> 1:16:47.419
Look at that.

1:16:48.419 --> 1:16:50.121
I'd say she's done.

1:16:50.153 --> 1:16:52.156
Ain't that a thing of beauty?

1:16:59.563 --> 1:17:00.563
Wyatt!

1:17:05.570 --> 1:17:06.772
Get in!

1:17:16.914 --> 1:17:17.916
You still with us?

1:17:18.249 --> 1:17:20.485
Less of me.

1:17:21.919 --> 1:17:23.889
Whoa. Whoa.

1:17:30.161 --> 1:17:31.163
Mccarty!

1:17:33.330 --> 1:17:35.065
You dead yet?

1:17:35.866 --> 1:17:37.134
I sure ain't.

1:17:37.168 --> 1:17:38.969
I'm assuming the fact
I ain't seen

1:17:39.003 --> 1:17:41.272
my man duggan this morning

1:17:41.304 --> 1:17:44.075
means he must have crossed
paths with you,

1:17:44.107 --> 1:17:45.943
and things didn't go his way.

1:17:48.345 --> 1:17:51.950
Seeing as how I just killed
your man al here,

1:17:51.982 --> 1:17:53.485
I'd say that squares us.

1:17:54.585 --> 1:17:56.120
No more games.

1:17:56.152 --> 1:17:58.823
You got one minute to come out.

1:18:00.457 --> 1:18:02.393
You nearly got us both killed,

1:18:02.425 --> 1:18:04.294
which is about all your
tears and rage

1:18:04.327 --> 1:18:05.463
would have amounted to.

1:18:07.932 --> 1:18:11.402
Now keep your damn head down.
You'll be all right.

1:18:18.241 --> 1:18:19.543
<i>Keep your head down,</i>

1:18:19.576 --> 1:18:21.178
<i>you'll be all right.</i>

1:18:28.385 --> 1:18:30.388
Poe and mckinney were
on the porch.

1:18:32.223 --> 1:18:33.425
Garrett went in the house.

1:18:40.497 --> 1:18:43.101
Two shots... but he...

1:18:44.201 --> 1:18:48.240
And you were
speaking Spanish to 'em.

1:18:51.675 --> 1:18:53.210
But he didn't kill you.

1:18:54.010 --> 1:18:55.647
He helped you escape.

1:18:57.080 --> 1:18:58.349
You're him.

1:19:01.285 --> 1:19:02.487
He's who?

1:19:05.121 --> 1:19:06.323
Bonney.

1:19:07.525 --> 1:19:09.027
Pa, what is he talking about?

1:19:19.036 --> 1:19:21.139
Pa!

1:19:28.179 --> 1:19:29.981
Smart choice, friend.

1:19:42.593 --> 1:19:43.595
What's he saying?

1:20:20.031 --> 1:20:23.068
Don't you dare step outside.

1:22:36.433 --> 1:22:37.469
Ah.

1:22:40.470 --> 1:22:42.107
Aah!

1:24:25.976 --> 1:24:28.213
Fuck.

1:26:54.857 --> 1:26:55.892
You all right?

1:27:15.912 --> 1:27:16.914
Oh.

1:27:20.951 --> 1:27:24.822
Wyatt. Fetch
a pail of water and some rags.

1:27:24.854 --> 1:27:25.854
Go on.

1:27:33.729 --> 1:27:36.500
You've certainly seen
better days.

1:27:36.532 --> 1:27:38.402
I knew you had a familiar face.

1:27:39.236 --> 1:27:41.671
I just couldn't place
it at first.

1:27:42.572 --> 1:27:44.874
We'll get the doc.

1:27:44.907 --> 1:27:47.144
First I gotta slow the bleed.

1:27:48.245 --> 1:27:50.648
How you manage
to stay hidden all these years?

1:27:51.814 --> 1:27:53.884
Let's get some of this
shirt off you.

1:27:53.916 --> 1:27:55.820
I can use it to tie
off this leg.

1:28:33.189 --> 1:28:34.459
Well, shit.

1:28:35.692 --> 1:28:37.462
I wish you didn't see that.

1:28:43.866 --> 1:28:46.870
It's just like I heard
you tell your boy before.

1:28:47.704 --> 1:28:51.843
Ain't that I lied, I just never
told you the whole truth.

1:28:53.076 --> 1:28:55.246
Was you law at all?

1:28:55.278 --> 1:28:57.781
Sheriff of woods county,
just like I said.

1:28:59.148 --> 1:29:00.150
Me and my deputies,

1:29:00.183 --> 1:29:02.719
we signed on with ketchum
back in the spring.

1:29:04.120 --> 1:29:05.689
We had to take their brand.

1:29:07.124 --> 1:29:08.592
Done a few jobs with 'em.

1:29:08.625 --> 1:29:10.060
But we figured out
they was planning

1:29:10.093 --> 1:29:11.629
to gun us down on this last go.

1:29:13.296 --> 1:29:15.265
So we tried to beat 'em
to the punch.

1:29:15.299 --> 1:29:17.768
Took off, and they plugged me
from a distance.

1:29:20.036 --> 1:29:22.106
They'd have hunted me
to the end of the earth.

1:29:24.308 --> 1:29:26.043
I'm sorry I ended up here.

1:29:27.978 --> 1:29:30.181
Last thing I wanted,
you wanna know the truth of it.

1:29:32.715 --> 1:29:34.155
'Cause you were good to
me back then.

1:29:35.018 --> 1:29:36.020
Huh.

1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:39.120
I could never square
you done the things they said.

1:29:40.357 --> 1:29:42.927
Though I sure as hell
can believe it now.

1:29:52.902 --> 1:29:54.838
I don't even remember you.

1:29:55.938 --> 1:29:59.175
Well, why would you?
I was just a ranch hand.

1:30:00.911 --> 1:30:03.147
Now I get to be the man
who killed Billy the kid.

1:30:17.361 --> 1:30:19.229
- You hold on, I'll get the doc.
- No.

1:30:21.164 --> 1:30:22.198
Pa.

1:30:22.232 --> 1:30:24.569
It's a miracle I made
it this far.

1:30:27.903 --> 1:30:29.240
Once this gets out...

1:30:30.674 --> 1:30:33.611
You gonna hear some
things about me.

1:30:33.643 --> 1:30:34.978
Some of it's true.

1:30:36.045 --> 1:30:37.347
A lot of it ain't.

1:30:39.015 --> 1:30:41.251
Fact is...

1:30:42.385 --> 1:30:45.923
I don't even know
who or what I was anymore.

1:30:47.323 --> 1:30:51.262
I don't believe in redemption.

1:30:53.362 --> 1:30:56.032
But a man can find some
kind of solace...

1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:00.269
If he's got a boy like
you to raise.

1:31:03.240 --> 1:31:04.875
The world is changing.

1:31:07.009 --> 1:31:08.278
You go see it.

1:31:09.979 --> 1:31:12.750
It's a place I don't belong in
no more.

1:31:16.385 --> 1:31:18.022
I'm hoping...

1:31:19.289 --> 1:31:20.724
You do.

1:31:31.168 --> 1:31:32.637
Pa?

1:31:33.903 --> 1:31:35.039
Pa?

1:33:16.138 --> 1:33:17.407
Come on.
