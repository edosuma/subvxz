00:25.680 --> 00:27.130
[moans]

00:27.165 --> 00:27.993
- [Man] Cut!

00:28.028 --> 00:29.408
Stop, stop, stop!

00:31.514 --> 00:33.067
- For fuck's sake.

00:33.102 --> 00:35.000
It's my only scene.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.346
Tosser.

00:36.381 --> 00:37.175
- Jesus.

00:37.209 --> 00:38.038
Cut!

00:38.072 --> 00:38.866
What the hell is going on?

00:38.900 --> 00:41.144
I say when we cut.

00:41.179 --> 00:42.697
- Well, if she's gonna attack me
like that

00:42.732 --> 00:45.217
and you don't see the problem's,
Bruce,

00:45.252 --> 00:47.668
then someone has to take charge.

00:47.702 --> 00:48.565
- All right, all right.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.773
Calm down.

00:49.808 --> 00:51.292
- I've been up all night
and I'm seriously

00:51.327 --> 00:53.260
gonna get one of my
heads in a minute.

00:53.294 --> 00:54.951
- What exactly is the problem,
Greg?

00:54.985 --> 00:59.162
- It's that extra, or
whatever the fuck she is.

00:59.197 --> 01:01.371
If the undead are supposed
to be attacking me,

01:01.406 --> 01:02.579
then I'm gonna need
them to be a little bit

01:02.614 --> 01:04.409
more vocal about it.

01:04.443 --> 01:05.444
- Vocal?

01:05.479 --> 01:06.825
- You know, raw.

01:08.033 --> 01:09.414
- She's a zombie.

01:09.448 --> 01:10.449
- You're telling me.

01:10.484 --> 01:13.935
Where the fuck
do they get these people?

01:13.970 --> 01:15.592
If she is just gonna
go about whining,

01:15.627 --> 01:16.835
and not take it seriously,

01:16.869 --> 01:19.734
then it's not gonna make
me look menacing, is it?

01:19.769 --> 01:23.013
A real zombie
wouldn't just moan.

01:23.048 --> 01:23.842
- Right.

01:23.876 --> 01:24.670
Well, we'll deal with it.

01:24.705 --> 01:25.533
Rachel!

01:27.949 --> 01:31.056
Can we get the zombie to roar
when she attacks Greg, please?

01:31.091 --> 01:31.884
- Roar?

01:31.919 --> 01:32.713
- Just do it, sweetheart.

01:32.747 --> 01:33.886
Okay?

01:33.921 --> 01:35.302
- Thanks, love.

01:35.336 --> 01:36.682
Look, I'm sorry.

01:38.063 --> 01:39.582
I don't want to seem
difficult or anything.

01:39.616 --> 01:43.310
You know, I just want this
movie to be marvelous.

01:43.344 --> 01:45.346
But seriously, if she
doesn't roar this time,

01:45.381 --> 01:48.142
can we think about
replacing her?

01:48.177 --> 01:49.523
Maybe get a guy.

01:50.593 --> 01:51.456
- Yeah.

01:51.490 --> 01:52.284
Of course, Greg.

01:52.319 --> 01:53.665
No problem.

01:53.699 --> 01:55.149
First positions.

01:55.184 --> 01:56.012
- Thanks.

01:56.046 --> 01:56.840
- Thank you.

01:56.875 --> 01:57.772
Okay.

01:57.807 --> 01:58.601
First positions then please,
everyone.

01:58.635 --> 02:00.154
Greg, hat.

02:00.189 --> 02:02.432
- Oh, sorry, love.

02:02.467 --> 02:03.537
- Come on, people.

02:03.571 --> 02:06.056
Continuity should be
picking up on this stuff.

02:06.091 --> 02:10.336
We'll take that roar
out in the edit, okay?

02:10.371 --> 02:12.960
Okay, we're going for a take on
this one.

02:12.994 --> 02:13.995
And rolling!

02:15.411 --> 02:16.239
Speed!

02:17.206 --> 02:18.103
And action!

02:26.870 --> 02:29.597
[rifle thudding]

02:31.841 --> 02:34.188
- That was better, Bruce.

02:34.223 --> 02:36.673
I hope you didn't mind, love.

02:36.708 --> 02:38.503
I wasn't being divaish, was I?

02:38.537 --> 02:39.711
I mean, I wouldn't want people
on set

02:39.745 --> 02:40.988
to think that I'm some sort of.

02:41.022 --> 02:41.851
- Cut.

04:15.807 --> 04:16.601
- Stop.

04:16.635 --> 04:18.291
This isn't right.

04:18.327 --> 04:20.293
We shouldn't be here.

04:20.329 --> 04:21.399
- Let me see.

04:22.745 --> 04:25.092
How did we get on this path?

04:26.058 --> 04:28.164
- See, it must've been
when we crossed this river.

04:28.198 --> 04:29.545
See, we should've
taken this route.

04:29.579 --> 04:31.409
We're way off.

04:31.443 --> 04:32.996
Can you get maps on that thing?

04:33.031 --> 04:33.825
- No.

04:33.859 --> 04:34.619
Still no signal.

04:34.653 --> 04:37.415
Look, it's dark,
I've had enough.

04:38.450 --> 04:40.280
Let's just put up the tent here

04:40.314 --> 04:41.350
and get a fresh start
in the morning.

04:41.384 --> 04:42.247
All right?

04:43.110 --> 04:43.938
- Fine.

04:50.635 --> 04:53.085
- Well, he was supposed to
be in a scene yesterday,

04:53.120 --> 04:54.708
only he never showed up.

04:54.742 --> 04:56.088
It's not like him.

04:56.123 --> 04:58.228
He still had his zombie
eyes in, and his makeup on,

04:58.263 --> 04:59.264
and everything.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.335
- And is it true that he
is not the first person

05:01.370 --> 05:04.269
to disappear from this film set?

05:04.304 --> 05:07.997
- Apparently, they found a body
last week.

05:08.031 --> 05:10.413
One of the camera crew,
someone said.

05:10.448 --> 05:12.104
It was horrible by all accounts.

05:12.139 --> 05:14.383
Looked like something
out of the film.

05:14.417 --> 05:17.696
I think some animals had got
to him before the police did.

05:17.731 --> 05:20.803
- Yes, well they're saying
that this film is cursed.

05:20.837 --> 05:22.218
Hoo-hoo.

05:22.252 --> 05:24.220
What do you think about that?

05:24.254 --> 05:26.015
- They would say that,
wouldn't they?

05:26.049 --> 05:27.465
Horror film, isn't it?

05:27.499 --> 05:29.639
It's good for publicity.

05:29.674 --> 05:31.676
- And apart from the
disappearances,

05:31.710 --> 05:34.126
didn't the film also
suffer delays when a scene

05:34.161 --> 05:38.786
being shot in a zoo had to be
abandoned because the star,

05:38.821 --> 05:42.790
and members of the crew,
were attacked by wild dogs?

05:42.825 --> 05:44.102
- That's right.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.450
- Well, Dawn.

05:48.693 --> 05:53.283
Let's hope your colleague turns
up safe, well, and undead.

05:57.046 --> 05:57.874
- Yeah.

05:59.082 --> 06:03.363
- Well, I'm sure you'll be
keeping an eye out for him.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.227
Ashley.

06:09.265 --> 06:10.093
- Great.

06:11.060 --> 06:12.130
Good.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.201
In other news,
the same film company

06:14.235 --> 06:17.480
will be filming a
second film which is.

06:20.725 --> 06:22.002
[growl echoes]

06:22.036 --> 06:23.383
- What was that?

06:25.902 --> 06:29.147
- Probably just a deer,
or a sheep, or something.

06:29.181 --> 06:32.150
There's loads of animals out on
the moors.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.463
- Yeah, but we're not
on the moors, are we?

06:34.497 --> 06:35.429
'Cause we strayed off the path

06:35.464 --> 06:38.190
exactly like we were
told not to.

06:39.502 --> 06:41.677
[creature growling]

06:41.711 --> 06:43.230
There it is again.

06:44.162 --> 06:45.405
- I heard that.

06:46.854 --> 06:49.374
[tense music]

06:52.239 --> 06:53.067
- Hello?

06:54.828 --> 06:56.277
Anyone out there?

06:58.728 --> 06:59.557
Great.

07:01.490 --> 07:05.286
- I've got a torch on
my phone with a camera.

07:06.598 --> 07:08.738
- This had better not
be one of those tricks,

07:08.773 --> 07:11.431
or something to try to scare us.

07:14.641 --> 07:17.885
It's a bright night and we'll
find you.

07:19.508 --> 07:22.545
And when we do,
we'll tear you a new.

07:23.719 --> 07:24.789
- [Man] Eyes.

07:33.073 --> 07:34.005
It's human.

07:35.385 --> 07:36.386
- Was human.

07:38.423 --> 07:40.183
The fuck's done that?

07:42.703 --> 07:44.015
- We've gotta go.

07:44.049 --> 07:45.499
We've gotta go
right fucking now.

07:45.534 --> 07:46.500
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:46.535 --> 07:47.363
Calm down.

07:51.643 --> 07:52.748
It's plastic.

07:56.027 --> 07:56.855
- What?

07:57.891 --> 08:00.445
- It's just latex and makeup.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.619
It's not real.

08:04.311 --> 08:05.139
Oh.

08:07.245 --> 08:08.280
This is.

08:08.315 --> 08:09.350
[creature growling]

08:09.385 --> 08:11.870
[man yelling]

08:15.046 --> 08:16.703
- Oh, that's better.

08:22.122 --> 08:23.330
Hi.

08:23.364 --> 08:25.919
Want to know some buried secrets
and very interesting news?

08:25.953 --> 08:26.747
- Not really.

08:26.782 --> 08:27.921
- Probably shouldn't
say anything

08:27.955 --> 08:30.130
'cause I was sworn to secrecy
by Phil at the butchers.

08:30.164 --> 08:32.201
He says they're filming a
new zombie film around here.

08:32.235 --> 08:33.996
He said they're using
our town as Lower Volts,

08:34.030 --> 08:37.827
a made up village, ravaged
by the living dead.

08:38.759 --> 08:40.001
Like Milton Keynes.

08:40.035 --> 08:41.140
- I'm serious.

08:41.174 --> 08:42.073
- Yes, Les.

08:42.107 --> 08:43.177
They start shooting on Monday

08:43.212 --> 08:45.455
with scenes from the pub in
Lower Volts.

08:45.490 --> 08:47.665
- How do you know
so much about it?

08:47.699 --> 08:50.219
- Welcome to The Severed Arms.

08:52.911 --> 08:54.395
- You are?

08:54.430 --> 08:57.398
- They're using the pub
as The Severed Arms,

08:57.433 --> 08:59.400
the local pub in the film.

08:59.435 --> 09:02.438
[breathing heavily]

09:03.922 --> 09:05.027
- No way.

09:05.061 --> 09:06.028
- Way.

09:06.062 --> 09:06.960
They were in here
a couple of weeks ago

09:06.994 --> 09:08.513
measuring up and everything.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.135
It's all supposed to be
very hush-hush.

09:10.170 --> 09:10.964
- Honest?

09:10.998 --> 09:12.068
- Yep.

09:12.103 --> 09:13.207
Showed me pictures of
what it's gonna look like,

09:13.242 --> 09:14.692
and all the stars,
and everything.

09:14.726 --> 09:15.796
[laughs]

09:15.831 --> 09:17.108
Well, the main bloke does
enough look like you.

09:17.142 --> 09:18.454
- Who is that?

09:18.488 --> 09:20.111
- Greg Lupeen.

09:20.145 --> 09:21.491
I couldn't believe it
when I saw his picture.

09:21.526 --> 09:22.700
You must have a double.

09:22.734 --> 09:23.597
- Well, I'll have a JD.

09:23.632 --> 09:24.805
Cheers, Bob.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.256
Oh, I know Greg Lupeen.

09:27.290 --> 09:30.052
He's a right twat, he is.

09:30.086 --> 09:31.950
And you think he's like me?

09:31.985 --> 09:32.779
- Yeah.

09:32.813 --> 09:34.332
Well, more so now.

09:35.229 --> 09:38.232
[breathing heavily]

09:39.268 --> 09:41.373
So this is gonna be
one of the locations.

09:41.408 --> 09:43.375
'Course it's gonna
cause some disturbance,

09:43.410 --> 09:44.618
but their gonna
reimburse me for loss

09:44.653 --> 09:46.447
of take-ins on top of the fee.

09:46.482 --> 09:47.828
- What, three pints
and a pork pie?

09:47.863 --> 09:48.898
- Shh.

09:48.933 --> 09:51.556
I told 'em it gets really busy.

10:03.810 --> 10:06.813
[breathing heavily]

10:07.986 --> 10:09.574
It's a bit of a secret, Les.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.956
But do you know what
they're paying me?

10:11.990 --> 10:13.129
- No.

10:13.164 --> 10:14.406
- Good.

10:14.441 --> 10:16.616
I know what you're
like with secrets.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.584
Here, have a pork pie
on the house.

10:26.902 --> 10:29.905
[breathing heavily]

10:32.355 --> 10:33.391
[door opens]

10:33.425 --> 10:34.254
Jesus.

10:36.187 --> 10:37.360
Is it raining?

10:38.223 --> 10:39.500
- Pissing down.

10:45.990 --> 10:47.474
- Hey, Mike.

10:47.508 --> 10:48.302
Do you know what?

10:48.337 --> 10:49.131
- Yep.

10:49.165 --> 10:49.959
- Ah, well.

10:49.994 --> 10:50.857
No you don't.

10:50.891 --> 10:52.168
You don't know
what I was gonna say.

10:52.203 --> 10:54.205
- Pint please, Roberto.

10:54.239 --> 10:55.620
I'll tell you what, Lesley.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.485
If I can guess what you're
about to say, you owe me a pint.

10:58.519 --> 11:01.350
If I get it wrong,
I'll buy you one.

11:01.384 --> 11:02.972
Deal?

11:03.007 --> 11:04.215
- No chance.

11:04.249 --> 11:05.112
You'll win.

11:05.147 --> 11:07.805
You always catch me out somehow.

11:11.636 --> 11:13.914
What was I gonna say then?

11:13.949 --> 11:14.777
- You were gonna tell me
about the new

11:14.812 --> 11:17.090
pelican crossing
outside the school.

11:17.124 --> 11:18.367
- Wrong.

11:18.401 --> 11:20.472
[laughs]

11:21.611 --> 11:24.442
- You just lost yourself
a pint then, didn't ya?

11:24.476 --> 11:26.996
You want to try again?

11:27.031 --> 11:28.757
- I don't know.

11:28.791 --> 11:31.035
What do you reckon, Bob?

11:31.069 --> 11:32.622
- Well, he got it wrong fist
time, Les.

11:32.657 --> 11:34.728
I'd give it a go.

11:34.763 --> 11:35.625
- Okay.

11:36.557 --> 11:37.766
You're on.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.353
What was I gonna say then?

11:39.388 --> 11:40.803
- You were gonna tell
me that they're making

11:40.838 --> 11:43.461
a new horror film around
here using the local town

11:43.495 --> 11:45.601
and various buildings for
locations

11:45.635 --> 11:47.914
in the fictitious village of
Lower Volts.

11:47.948 --> 11:51.193
Including using this place
as their local boozer,

11:51.227 --> 11:52.746
The Severed Arms.

11:52.781 --> 11:53.574
- Shit.

11:53.609 --> 11:54.403
- Two pounds today.

11:54.437 --> 11:55.576
Please, Les.

11:55.611 --> 11:56.439
- Cheers.

11:58.994 --> 12:01.375
- How did you know all that?

12:01.410 --> 12:03.481
- Bob told me last night.

12:08.624 --> 12:11.282
[subdued music]

12:22.742 --> 12:24.916
- Where do you want
the stretcher?

12:24.951 --> 12:26.746
- Won't need a stretcher.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.575
- You'd be better off
with a shovel.

12:28.609 --> 12:29.403
- Christ.

12:29.438 --> 12:30.232
Is that?

12:30.266 --> 12:31.336
- No, no, no.

12:32.475 --> 12:34.408
I've got a log burner.

12:34.443 --> 12:35.444
Right.

12:35.478 --> 12:36.997
Take those and put, 'em
in the boot, Haskins.

12:37.032 --> 12:37.860
- Okay.

12:39.689 --> 12:42.520
- Well, the main body's
over here.

12:45.903 --> 12:49.251
- And now I'm getting
one of my heads.

12:49.285 --> 12:51.115
I knew this would happen.

12:51.149 --> 12:52.495
- We'll have a word with her,
Greg.

12:52.530 --> 12:53.531
- Well, have two.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.395
And make sure
one of them is off.

12:55.429 --> 12:56.706
- Well.

12:56.741 --> 13:00.814
- Last night that zombie extra
was trying to steal my scene.

13:00.849 --> 13:02.264
My fucking scene!

13:03.541 --> 13:05.854
- She was trying to do it
quietly, Greg.

13:05.888 --> 13:07.890
- All she had to do was
get smashed in the face

13:07.925 --> 13:09.167
with the butt of a rifle.

13:09.202 --> 13:10.582
- You did hit her rather hard.

13:10.617 --> 13:12.757
- First, she doesn't
roar when she attacks me.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.138
And then, when she gets
her head smashed in,

13:14.172 --> 13:18.142
she falls out of shot and only
spits out two fucking teeth!

13:18.176 --> 13:20.247
- They were her teeth, Greg.

13:20.282 --> 13:22.422
- And now as it's my scene,

13:22.456 --> 13:26.944
suddenly she can manage to
scream for fucking England!

13:28.738 --> 13:29.878
- We'll have a word.

13:29.912 --> 13:32.018
- Well, make sure you do!

13:34.434 --> 13:35.607
Now, fuck off!

13:37.575 --> 13:38.403
- Cock.

13:41.890 --> 13:42.960
- [Policeman] Looks like
something a pack

13:42.994 --> 13:45.514
of wild animals would've done.

13:45.548 --> 13:49.345
- Well, I think we can rule out
suicide.

13:49.380 --> 13:50.415
Okay.

13:50.450 --> 13:53.798
I want a full report on
this as soon as you can.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.146
And team, keep looking for any
other bits.

13:57.181 --> 14:00.253
There's still a couple of
limbs missing.

14:00.287 --> 14:02.462
- Is this how the
deceased were discovered?

14:02.496 --> 14:04.360
- More or less.

14:04.395 --> 14:07.053
Haskins managed to slip in some.

14:13.473 --> 14:14.267
- Over here, sir.

14:14.301 --> 14:15.544
Found a phone.

14:15.578 --> 14:16.579
- Excellent.

14:16.614 --> 14:18.478
Bag it, tag it.

14:18.512 --> 14:19.893
Get it to the lab.

14:19.928 --> 14:20.860
- We've got a lab?

14:20.894 --> 14:21.688
- Yeah.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.519
Get it checked out.

14:25.554 --> 14:27.763
I want to know if they made
any phone calls before,

14:27.797 --> 14:29.523
or after, they died.

14:29.558 --> 14:31.732
Get that SIM card checked.

14:32.595 --> 14:33.942
- Over here, sir.

14:33.976 --> 14:35.081
Found something.

14:35.115 --> 14:36.530
- Excellent.

14:36.565 --> 14:37.842
What do we got, Haskins?

14:37.877 --> 14:41.604
- [Haskins] Nice bit of
spruce it think, sir.

14:44.469 --> 14:46.471
- Are you all right?

14:46.506 --> 14:47.576
- I told you.

14:47.610 --> 14:49.647
I got one of my heads coming on.

14:49.681 --> 14:50.510
Oh.

14:51.373 --> 14:52.546
Oh, god.

14:52.581 --> 14:55.170
It's gonna be
fucking murder tonight.

14:55.204 --> 14:56.171
- Shall I go and get?

14:56.205 --> 14:59.829
- I just need to be
left alone for a while.

14:59.864 --> 15:01.866
I just want to lie down.

15:02.936 --> 15:03.730
- I'll go and get.

15:03.764 --> 15:06.422
- I do not want to be disturbed.

15:07.665 --> 15:10.047
You're supposed to be a runner!

15:10.081 --> 15:11.082
Fucking run!

15:17.192 --> 15:19.711
[tense music]

15:24.406 --> 15:26.511
- Well, that's me done.

15:26.546 --> 15:28.168
I'll see you tomorrow, Robert.

15:28.203 --> 15:28.997
- All right, Nobby.

15:29.031 --> 15:29.859
Don't forget your torch.

15:29.894 --> 15:30.688
- You off, Nobby?

15:30.722 --> 15:31.516
- Yeah.

15:31.551 --> 15:32.932
- See you next Wednesday.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.623
[laughs]

15:34.657 --> 15:35.727
- Cheers.

15:35.762 --> 15:37.384
Stick it on the tab, Bob.

15:37.419 --> 15:39.317
- You still owe me for.

15:40.180 --> 15:41.181
What's that?

15:44.598 --> 15:46.462
- [Les] A finger.

15:46.497 --> 15:47.291
- Christ.

15:47.325 --> 15:48.602
That's horrible.

15:48.637 --> 15:50.466
- It's not even
been something fried.

15:50.501 --> 15:52.330
- It's just the box I put it in.

15:52.365 --> 15:54.401
I found it on the carpark
by the bins.

15:54.436 --> 15:56.541
At first, I thought it
might have been a fox.

15:56.576 --> 15:58.405
- What, with human fingers?

15:58.440 --> 15:59.234
- No, no, no.

15:59.268 --> 16:00.304
That put it there.

16:00.338 --> 16:01.132
- In the box?

16:01.167 --> 16:02.340
- By the bins.

16:03.238 --> 16:04.860
- Jesus.

16:04.894 --> 16:07.000
- It would be a prop from
that film, wouldn't it?

16:07.035 --> 16:07.863
- Oh, yeah.

16:07.897 --> 16:08.691
Of course.

16:08.726 --> 16:09.658
Yeah.

16:09.692 --> 16:10.590
Looks good, though.

16:10.624 --> 16:12.005
- Finger lickin' good.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.834
- The film crew will be
looking for that, you know?

16:13.869 --> 16:15.457
- He'll ask around.

16:16.906 --> 16:19.806
- See those two over there?

16:19.840 --> 16:21.842
I reckon they're with
that film lot.

16:21.877 --> 16:24.190
- Yeah, they stick out like a
sore thumb.

16:24.224 --> 16:28.228
- You got one of those in there
as well?

16:28.263 --> 16:29.091
- I don't suppose
either of you are

16:29.126 --> 16:32.094
looking for a finger
in the carpark?

16:39.791 --> 16:41.759
- They've been here
all afternoon

16:41.793 --> 16:44.175
drawing on their fancy iPads.

16:45.142 --> 16:47.316
Here you go, Dad.

16:47.351 --> 16:51.148
They made two glasses of white
wine last all bleeding day.

16:51.182 --> 16:54.358
- [Mike] Well, they're probably
from London, ain't they?

16:54.392 --> 16:57.740
Two glasses of wine
cost 20 quid down there.

16:57.775 --> 17:00.019
That's why I moved up here.

17:01.537 --> 17:03.884
- Do you reckon I could charge
20 quid?

17:03.919 --> 17:05.472
- No, Bob.

17:05.507 --> 17:06.577
- Well, you just said in London.

17:06.611 --> 17:07.887
- But we're not in London.

17:07.923 --> 17:09.820
In London,
you have London waiting,

17:09.856 --> 17:12.617
proper decor, proper music.

17:12.652 --> 17:14.377
- We've got proper...

17:16.932 --> 17:18.968
Actually, this isn't even proper
Blue Nun.

17:19.002 --> 17:23.627
- Yeah, and the only waiting
you have in here, it's um...

17:23.663 --> 17:24.801
It's when...

17:24.836 --> 17:25.906
Oh, bollocks.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.564
That was a good joke, that was.

17:28.599 --> 17:29.496
I nearly had it then.

17:29.531 --> 17:31.050
- Yeah, don't worry about it,
Lesley.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.121
I don't think performing arts is
for you.

17:33.155 --> 17:34.915
- That's where you
might be wrong.

17:34.950 --> 17:37.573
Two more white wines, please.

17:37.608 --> 17:38.436
- 18?

17:38.471 --> 17:39.299
- No, Bob.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.407
- You guys local, yeah?

17:43.441 --> 17:44.580
- Local?

17:44.615 --> 17:45.443
Us?

17:46.582 --> 17:48.998
We're as local as...

17:49.033 --> 17:49.861
As, um...

17:51.104 --> 17:52.657
As your local shop.

17:54.245 --> 17:57.731
- Our local shop is in
Hampstead.

17:57.766 --> 17:59.595
- Our local shop then.

18:00.631 --> 18:02.667
- Our local shop's Lidl, Les.

18:02.702 --> 18:03.875
Lidl's German.

18:04.945 --> 18:06.223
- All right.

18:06.257 --> 18:08.363
We're as local as, got it.

18:08.397 --> 18:09.640
Waiting at the bar,
London waiting.

18:09.674 --> 18:11.124
That's it!

18:11.159 --> 18:12.781
The only waiting you
have in here.

18:12.815 --> 18:14.886
- Shut up, Les.

18:14.921 --> 18:18.304
[growling and screaming]

18:19.477 --> 18:20.754
Sorry, I'm Mike.

18:20.789 --> 18:21.583
The boys are local.

18:21.617 --> 18:22.791
They grew up around here.

18:22.825 --> 18:23.619
You were saying?

18:23.654 --> 18:25.173
- That'll be 15 pounds, please.

18:25.207 --> 18:26.035
- No it won't, Bob.

18:26.070 --> 18:26.864
It's okay.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.279
I'll get 'em.

18:28.314 --> 18:30.937
Stick 5.50 on me slate.

18:30.971 --> 18:31.972
- Thank you.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.975
I'm Ryan and this is Trace.

18:35.010 --> 18:37.737
Assistant producer on
the zombie film shoot.

18:37.771 --> 18:40.636
What I was saying is we're
looking for some extras.

18:40.671 --> 18:42.776
- So if any of you guys
fancy it,

18:42.811 --> 18:45.434
it's merely background
stuff, but maybe a walk-on.

18:45.469 --> 18:47.574
We got Greg Lupeen as the lead.

18:47.609 --> 18:49.645
There are a few graveyard
scenes that we need people

18:49.680 --> 18:51.509
to be on night shoots
as zombies.

18:51.544 --> 18:52.855
Should be very exciting.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.340
Lots of makeup, lots of blood.

18:54.374 --> 18:56.445
All that kind of stuff.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.653
- We get paid for it?

18:57.688 --> 18:59.448
- Yeah, of course.

18:59.483 --> 19:01.485
- I'm up for it.

19:01.519 --> 19:03.003
Beats flipping burgers.

19:03.038 --> 19:04.143
- Or plating my guys.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.317
- Or bastard factory work.

19:07.491 --> 19:08.940
I'm up for it, too.

19:08.975 --> 19:11.184
Hey, can you imagine
seeing this place

19:11.219 --> 19:14.153
with brain dead zombie
shuffling around?

19:14.187 --> 19:15.775
- Well, we start in the morning,

19:15.809 --> 19:18.433
so if you come with to
the truck with prod,

19:18.467 --> 19:20.020
our production office,

19:20.055 --> 19:22.195
then someone should be
able to sort you out.

19:22.230 --> 19:25.302
- Do we have to wear
our own clothes?

19:25.336 --> 19:26.303
- Um.

19:26.337 --> 19:29.340
- Do we have to wear
our own zombie clothes?

19:29.375 --> 19:32.619
- Do you have your
own zombie clothes?

19:32.654 --> 19:34.380
- Nothing zombie, no.

19:36.244 --> 19:37.417
- No.

19:37.452 --> 19:40.006
We're sure wardrobe will be
able to sort you all out.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.525
- You look strangely familiar.

19:41.559 --> 19:43.009
What's your name?

19:43.941 --> 19:44.769
- Les.

19:44.804 --> 19:45.805
- What?

19:45.839 --> 19:47.013
- Les.

19:47.047 --> 19:47.841
- What?

19:47.876 --> 19:48.704
- Les!

19:49.843 --> 19:51.397
- Yes, Les what?

19:51.431 --> 19:52.708
- Oh.

19:52.743 --> 19:53.571
Jarvis.

19:54.572 --> 19:57.023
- Have you made
any films before?

19:57.057 --> 19:59.474
- I made a few copies
of naughty nudes once,

19:59.508 --> 20:01.752
but they all came out crap.

20:06.515 --> 20:09.518
[creature growling]

20:12.107 --> 20:13.246
- Another drink?

20:13.281 --> 20:15.248
A little wine?

20:15.283 --> 20:18.562
- Crumbs,
I wouldn't say it was little.

20:18.596 --> 20:20.184
- No, Lidl.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.772
It's from Lidl.

20:21.806 --> 20:22.600
Would you like?

20:22.635 --> 20:23.429
- No, no, no, no.

20:23.463 --> 20:25.120
We've gotta be off.

20:25.154 --> 20:29.883
- Yes, well here's my card and
we'll see you in the morning.

20:29.918 --> 20:30.746
Bye.

20:32.092 --> 20:32.886
- [Mike] See ya.

20:32.921 --> 20:33.887
- [Les] Bye.

20:37.995 --> 20:40.239
[growling]

20:46.831 --> 20:47.936
- What the fuck was that?

20:47.970 --> 20:49.144
- Hey, how about that?

20:49.178 --> 20:53.113
We're gonna be in
a film in the morning.

20:53.148 --> 20:54.529
I better pull me finger out.

20:54.563 --> 20:55.806
Get it?

20:55.840 --> 20:57.428
- Stop pissing about, Les.

20:57.463 --> 21:00.051
Stick that behind the bar, Bob.

21:01.225 --> 21:04.055
- Yeah, gonna be
in a proper film.

21:06.713 --> 21:09.302
- That one called Trace.

21:09.337 --> 21:11.822
Was that a bloke or a woman?

21:11.856 --> 21:13.824
- He had an Adam's apple
and hairy arms, Les.

21:13.858 --> 21:16.965
But because his name's Trace,
suddenly you're not sure.

21:16.999 --> 21:19.312
- Well, it's a woman's name.

21:19.347 --> 21:20.934
I went out with a Trace once.

21:20.969 --> 21:23.074
- Ah, that's why
you're confused.

21:23.109 --> 21:26.043
'Cause that one had an Adam's
apple and hairy arms as well.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.976
- Did you hear what
he said though?

21:28.010 --> 21:30.185
He said I seemed familiar.

21:30.219 --> 21:32.498
- Yeah, well I wouldn't
get too familiar, Les.

21:32.532 --> 21:35.604
You know what
this film lot are like.

21:37.710 --> 21:40.264
They're all trouser bandits,
mate.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.541
- I know.

21:41.576 --> 21:44.751
Look, he's even
put it on his card.

21:44.786 --> 21:45.683
Ass prod.

21:45.718 --> 21:47.064
- No, you donut.

21:48.203 --> 21:51.379
I think you'll find he's
the assistant producer.

21:51.413 --> 21:52.241
- I reckon Ryan and Trace
will be

21:52.276 --> 21:53.933
grooming you in the morning,
Les.

21:53.967 --> 21:56.453
- Nah, they have hairdressers
for that.

21:56.487 --> 21:57.592
I don't see those
two wanting to put

21:57.626 --> 21:59.628
product in me hair somehow.

21:59.663 --> 22:00.629
- I don't know.

22:00.664 --> 22:02.562
I reckon the one might.

22:09.569 --> 22:12.089
[tense music]

22:40.738 --> 22:42.947
[yells]
[wings flapping]

22:42.982 --> 22:44.501
- Fucking.

22:44.535 --> 22:46.710
[gasping]

22:49.264 --> 22:52.267
[creature growling]

23:06.350 --> 23:10.734
[yelling]
[creature growling]

23:10.768 --> 23:11.666
- Oh, shit.

23:19.984 --> 23:20.882
- Morning, Les.

23:20.916 --> 23:22.470
- Hello, Mike.

23:22.504 --> 23:24.610
Have you seen how much stuff
you can have for breakfast?

23:24.644 --> 23:25.887
There's bloody loads of it.

23:25.921 --> 23:27.406
You can have as much
as you like.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.235
- What time did you get here?

23:29.269 --> 23:30.339
- About six.

23:30.374 --> 23:31.755
- [Mike] We're not called
till seven.

23:31.789 --> 23:33.481
- I know, but they said
breakfast will be served
from five

23:33.515 --> 23:34.758
'cause they're
shooting some dark,

23:34.792 --> 23:36.035
scary scenes at the graveyard.

23:36.069 --> 23:37.174
So I thought
I best get here pronto

23:37.208 --> 23:39.452
before them bleeding actors
get in and wolf it down.

23:39.487 --> 23:40.971
- Just for the free breakfast?

23:41.005 --> 23:41.834
- Too right.

23:41.868 --> 23:43.283
Saves getting your own,
doesn't it?

23:43.318 --> 23:44.975
- That's typical Les Jarvis,
isn't it?

23:45.009 --> 23:47.011
All them bleeding actors have
been working through the night

23:47.046 --> 23:48.875
with all them
bleeding film crew.

23:48.910 --> 23:50.256
You turn up at six o'clock
in the morning

23:50.290 --> 23:51.568
just to get to the front
of the queue.

23:51.602 --> 23:53.086
- I wasn't first in the
queue, for you information.

23:53.121 --> 23:54.294
I was a few minutes late.

23:54.329 --> 23:55.434
I would've been first,
but me mum had done me

23:55.468 --> 23:57.505
a lot of toast and bacon.

23:57.539 --> 23:58.609
- So you'd already
had a load of.

23:58.644 --> 23:59.472
- Hello, Mike.

23:59.507 --> 24:00.818
You all ready?

24:00.853 --> 24:01.923
Seen any zombies yet?

24:01.957 --> 24:03.372
- Just the one, Bob.

24:03.407 --> 24:04.477
- Hi, Bob.

24:04.512 --> 24:05.478
- Bloody hell.

24:05.513 --> 24:06.341
What time is it?

24:06.375 --> 24:07.238
I'm not late, am I?

24:07.273 --> 24:09.171
- No, five minutes early,
actually.

24:09.206 --> 24:10.345
- Blimey, this.

24:10.379 --> 24:11.760
That looks good.

24:11.795 --> 24:14.349
Gray putrified flesh
and the hair.

24:14.383 --> 24:15.868
They're good, these makeup
people, aren't they?

24:15.902 --> 24:17.076
- He's not been in yet.

24:17.110 --> 24:18.111
- Oh.

24:18.146 --> 24:19.458
- [Mike] He's only been
to the catering unit.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.631
- Yeah, I've just been there.

24:20.666 --> 24:21.908
They ran out of
nearly everything.

24:21.943 --> 24:23.289
All the meats gone.

24:23.323 --> 24:27.776
- Apparently, the meat
got stolen in the
night or something.

24:28.639 --> 24:29.709
- [Bruce] And cut.

24:29.744 --> 24:30.779
Okay, that's breakfast.

24:30.814 --> 24:32.332
Back on set at quarter to,
everyone.

24:32.367 --> 24:33.195
Thank you.

24:34.714 --> 24:36.509
- Why'd they nick all the meat?

24:36.544 --> 24:38.028
Bastards.

24:38.062 --> 24:39.685
Bloody starving.

24:39.719 --> 24:40.513
Did you get anything?

24:40.548 --> 24:41.618
- Did I, heck.

24:41.652 --> 24:43.999
Lesley seemed to scrape
through though, didn't ya?

24:44.034 --> 24:45.518
- I was lucky, really.

24:45.553 --> 24:48.521
Hey, I managed to save the
last of the sausages for later.

24:48.556 --> 24:49.453
- Oh, really?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.144
- Yeah, there was only
a couple left.

24:51.179 --> 24:52.905
They were like bullets.

24:52.939 --> 24:55.114
Normally, I wouldn't eat this
stuff with a 10-foot pole,

24:55.148 --> 24:56.805
but, well, you know.

24:58.117 --> 25:01.845
Hey, you should've got
down here earlier, Bob.

25:01.879 --> 25:05.400
I was the early bird and
that's why I've got worms.

25:05.434 --> 25:07.402
- I'll have a word with
the girl in a minute.

25:07.436 --> 25:09.438
- You should have a word
with the director or someone.

25:09.473 --> 25:10.785
Never speak to the monkey, Bob.

25:10.819 --> 25:12.856
Always speak to the organ donor.

25:12.890 --> 25:14.271
- Okay, my lovelies.

25:14.305 --> 25:15.099
I'm Alison.

25:15.134 --> 25:17.170
I'm the first assistant
director.

25:17.205 --> 25:18.689
If you've been to
hair and wardrobe,

25:18.724 --> 25:20.795
go and get yourself a
breakfast and sit on the bus.

25:20.829 --> 25:23.004
Someone will come and
collect you when we're ready.

25:23.038 --> 25:24.039
- Breakfast?

25:24.074 --> 25:25.454
If only.

25:25.489 --> 25:26.455
- Sorry.

25:26.490 --> 25:27.387
Yeah, I heard that they
run out of breakfast

25:27.422 --> 25:29.113
pretty early today.

25:29.148 --> 25:29.942
And you are?

25:29.976 --> 25:31.391
- Fucking starving.

25:31.426 --> 25:33.635
- I'm Mike and this is Bob.

25:33.670 --> 25:34.671
- Hi, Mike.

25:34.705 --> 25:35.603
- [Mike] And this is.

25:35.637 --> 25:36.500
- Oh, hi.

25:37.328 --> 25:38.744
That looks good.

25:38.778 --> 25:41.540
Didn't expect to see you here.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.300
- I'm just chatting and stuff.

25:43.334 --> 25:45.544
- [Alison] I thought you
were on set.

25:45.578 --> 25:46.475
- Me?

25:46.510 --> 25:47.753
Nah.

25:47.787 --> 25:49.030
- Okay.

25:49.064 --> 25:52.585
It's just that I've never seen
you speak to extras before.

25:52.620 --> 25:54.035
What is it that you call them?

25:54.069 --> 25:56.485
Detestable pond life.

25:56.520 --> 25:57.625
- Nice.

25:57.659 --> 25:58.971
- We're sitting right here,
love.

25:59.005 --> 26:02.319
- Oh, did you manage to
get your special breakfast?

26:02.353 --> 26:03.354
- Your what?

26:03.389 --> 26:04.804
- [Man On Radio] Alison,
are you there?

26:04.839 --> 26:05.667
- Sorry.

26:05.702 --> 26:07.013
Go ahead, Steve.

26:07.048 --> 26:07.842
Sorry, Greg.

26:07.876 --> 26:09.878
I've got to leave.

26:09.913 --> 26:11.811
You're breaking up, Steve.

26:11.846 --> 26:14.400
- We'll be in the pond if you
need us.

26:14.434 --> 26:15.781
Cheeky gal.

26:15.815 --> 26:17.127
- Greg?

26:17.161 --> 26:18.542
- Who's Greg?

26:18.577 --> 26:21.959
- How come Greg gets
a special breakfast?

26:23.512 --> 26:24.928
She called you Greg.

26:24.962 --> 26:26.101
[phone ringing]

26:26.136 --> 26:28.794
- She must've mistaken
me for someone.

26:28.828 --> 26:29.795
- Yeah.

26:29.829 --> 26:30.658
Greg.

26:32.452 --> 26:34.247
Greg Lupeen.

26:34.282 --> 26:37.665
Even she thought you
looked like that twat.

26:37.699 --> 26:39.701
She's not far wrong, is she?

26:39.736 --> 26:43.602
You must look like him
if you even fooled her.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.611
[sighs]

26:54.336 --> 26:56.166
- That was the police.

26:57.685 --> 27:00.170
They found Nobby from the pub.

27:01.447 --> 27:03.069
A real mess.

27:03.104 --> 27:04.933
- Well, he had sunk a fair few.

27:04.968 --> 27:06.659
We were all in a bit
of a mess, weren't we.

27:06.694 --> 27:07.487
[laughing]

27:07.522 --> 27:08.523
- He's dead.

27:12.147 --> 27:12.976
- What?

27:13.942 --> 27:15.461
- He was attacked.

27:17.601 --> 27:18.947
- When?

27:18.982 --> 27:22.433
- Last night near a park on the
way home.

27:24.850 --> 27:27.680
It was a frenzied attack.

27:27.715 --> 27:30.062
Literally been ripped apart.

27:47.976 --> 27:50.565
- Serial killer, or psychopath.

27:53.706 --> 27:55.915
They seems to be random killings

27:55.950 --> 27:58.711
following a similar pattern.

27:58.746 --> 28:00.437
These horrible murders
are all linked

28:00.471 --> 28:03.129
by one common connection.

28:03.164 --> 28:04.648
- All male?

28:04.683 --> 28:05.787
- No.

28:05.822 --> 28:08.031
- All savagely attacked?

28:08.065 --> 28:09.101
- No.

28:09.135 --> 28:11.931
- All found in, or near,
woodland?

28:14.762 --> 28:16.384
- There's...

28:16.418 --> 28:19.525
There are a few common
connections, but the.

28:19.559 --> 28:21.423
- Oh, oh, oh.

28:21.458 --> 28:24.150
All occurred during a full moon?

28:24.185 --> 28:25.013
- No.

28:25.048 --> 28:26.083
Did it?

28:26.118 --> 28:26.946
Right.

28:28.983 --> 28:30.674
Make a note of that.

28:32.607 --> 28:34.920
The one common connection.

28:34.954 --> 28:37.646
[pens rattling]

28:50.798 --> 28:53.973
The one common connection is.

28:54.008 --> 28:56.527
[pen banging]

29:00.359 --> 29:03.327
The one common connection is
[phone vibrating]

29:03.362 --> 29:04.777
that they are all in
some way linked

29:04.812 --> 29:09.368
to this bloody zombie lot
making a film in the village.

29:11.819 --> 29:13.510
So, what do we have?

29:17.514 --> 29:18.308
Thank you.

29:19.343 --> 29:23.209
The first victim was a
cameraman on the film.

29:23.244 --> 29:27.938
Now, his body was discovered
in Wales whilst filming.

29:27.973 --> 29:32.874
Then we got that grizzly
attack on the backpackers.

29:32.909 --> 29:34.496
Now this.

29:34.531 --> 29:36.602
[fingers snapping]

29:36.636 --> 29:37.465
Yes?

29:40.088 --> 29:43.989
- What makes you so sure
it was a grizzly, sir?

29:59.004 --> 30:01.178
[gasping]

30:05.044 --> 30:06.735
- [Bruce] Great scene, Greg.

30:06.770 --> 30:10.774
- You don't need to blow
smoke up my ass, Bruce.

30:15.434 --> 30:16.262
Jesus!

30:17.505 --> 30:19.852
Who do you have to kill to
get decent coffee around here?

30:19.887 --> 30:20.819
[man yells]

30:20.853 --> 30:22.544
- I'll get you some, Mr. Lupeen.

30:22.579 --> 30:23.649
- Proper coffee.

30:23.683 --> 30:26.065
Not the nasty shit
from that pub.

30:26.100 --> 30:28.757
Oh, and get me the rewrites
to scene 17

30:28.792 --> 30:30.794
before I actually shoot it,
will you?

30:30.829 --> 30:31.864
- Yes, Mr. Lupeen.

30:31.899 --> 30:33.072
- I'll be in my trailer

30:33.107 --> 30:35.695
where I'll be trying to
fucking meditate.

30:35.730 --> 30:39.630
Do not disturb unless
you're Spielberg,

30:39.665 --> 30:42.219
Angelina Jolie, or God himself.

30:44.187 --> 30:45.671
- Yes, Mr. Wanker.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.642
Alison, Greg's gone back
to his trailer.

30:51.677 --> 30:53.610
Seems he's his
twatty self again.

30:53.644 --> 30:54.714
- Oh?

30:54.749 --> 30:56.855
I've just been speaking
to him and he seemed fine.

30:56.889 --> 30:58.995
He was even talking
to the extras.

30:59.029 --> 31:01.549
What's the matter with him now?

31:01.583 --> 31:03.620
- He's calling everyone amateurs

31:03.654 --> 31:06.416
and says he thinks he has one
of his heads coming on again.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.936
I don't think we're gonna
see him again for a while.

31:08.970 --> 31:09.902
- Shit.

31:09.937 --> 31:11.800
We need to complete on the
graveyard scene

31:11.835 --> 31:14.044
before it gets too bright.

31:14.079 --> 31:15.494
- Good luck with that.

31:15.528 --> 31:17.151
He's gone to meditate.

31:17.185 --> 31:20.223
He says the sunlight's
giving him a migraine.

31:20.257 --> 31:21.569
- For fuck's sake.

31:21.603 --> 31:23.191
Bruce will go mental.

31:23.226 --> 31:25.745
We're already behind schedule.

31:26.712 --> 31:27.816
Bollocks.

31:27.851 --> 31:30.681
- Were found dangling
from a tree.

31:31.993 --> 31:34.893
Now, with the new
discovery of poor

31:38.758 --> 31:40.070
Nobby,

31:40.105 --> 31:41.623
God rest his soul,

31:42.555 --> 31:44.730
I think we can be fairly
certain that somebody

31:44.764 --> 31:48.837
from this film crew has
seen, or heard something.

31:50.322 --> 31:54.153
There's a dangerous person,
or persons, out there.

31:54.188 --> 31:54.982
- Sir?

31:55.016 --> 31:56.017
- Yes?

31:56.052 --> 31:56.845
- We've had a breakthrough
with the SIM card

31:56.880 --> 31:58.675
from the backpacker's phone.

31:58.709 --> 32:03.714
There's some footage on there
I think you might want to see.

32:11.136 --> 32:12.240
- [Bruce On Radio] We need
to get ready to complete

32:12.275 --> 32:13.759
on the graveyard scene, Ally.

32:13.793 --> 32:15.278
Can you send Greg?

32:16.382 --> 32:18.626
- He's refusing to come
out of his caravan.

32:18.660 --> 32:20.283
Rachel, you better tell
Bruce that.

32:20.317 --> 32:21.146
- Hold on.

32:25.012 --> 32:26.461
Excuse me.

32:26.496 --> 32:27.290
Les, isn't it?

32:27.324 --> 32:28.222
- Uh, yeah.

32:29.326 --> 32:32.951
- Les, it would seem that
you have a doppelganger.

32:32.985 --> 32:35.677
- No, they're just
ordinary sausages.

32:35.712 --> 32:36.989
You can have 'em back,
if you like.

32:37.024 --> 32:38.301
- A clone?

32:38.335 --> 32:39.405
- Oh.

32:39.440 --> 32:42.098
- You know Greg Lupeen,
star of this film, right?

32:42.132 --> 32:43.444
- I've seen pictures of him.

32:43.478 --> 32:44.928
- You look so similar.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.757
You could have the same mother.

32:46.792 --> 32:48.138
- Shame he ain't got
the same father.

32:48.173 --> 32:49.760
Could save a lengthy search.

32:49.795 --> 32:51.693
- See, I told you
you look like him.

32:51.728 --> 32:52.660
I thought it was you
when I saw him

32:52.694 --> 32:53.937
getting out of his car earlier.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.732
- Why, does he look like a
clown, too?

32:55.766 --> 32:57.837
- Look, I'll be frank.

32:57.872 --> 32:59.598
I need to speak to the producer,

32:59.632 --> 33:01.841
but we need to get
a scene shot urgently

33:01.876 --> 33:04.499
and I don't think we're
gonna get Greg outside.

33:04.534 --> 33:06.053
It's only a middle
distance shot,

33:06.087 --> 33:08.400
but if we paid you
some extra money,

33:08.434 --> 33:10.816
would you be Greg for us?

33:10.850 --> 33:11.920
- Okay.

33:11.955 --> 33:13.025
Yeah.

33:13.060 --> 33:15.510
- If he finds out though,
he will go ballistic.

33:15.545 --> 33:16.373
- [Les] Okay.

33:16.408 --> 33:17.581
- Right.

33:17.616 --> 33:19.756
So I'm gonna need you two
to keep it under wraps, too.

33:19.790 --> 33:22.034
Perhaps if we get you
both in the scene as well,

33:22.069 --> 33:23.553
that way we'll all be in on it.

33:23.587 --> 33:25.348
- Brilliant.

33:25.382 --> 33:26.659
Right.

33:26.694 --> 33:31.699
So you're gonna be Frank, I'm
Greg, so they'll have to be?

33:32.148 --> 33:33.459
- Discreet.

33:33.494 --> 33:34.529
- Brilliant.

33:34.564 --> 33:36.635
We've all got characters.

33:40.466 --> 33:42.296
- [Man On Tape] What?

33:42.330 --> 33:43.331
[all gasp]

33:43.366 --> 33:44.884
- [Man On Tape]
Latex and makeup.

33:44.919 --> 33:46.058
It's not real.

33:48.716 --> 33:49.544
Oh.

33:51.546 --> 33:52.685
This is.

33:52.720 --> 33:53.962
[creature growling]

33:53.997 --> 33:56.482
[man yelling]

33:59.761 --> 34:00.555
[door slams]

34:00.590 --> 34:01.936
- Fucking Jesus.

34:03.524 --> 34:05.595
- Have I missed anything?

34:05.629 --> 34:07.114
Ooh, Black Forest.

34:11.014 --> 34:12.326
- How does he walk
in these trousers?

34:12.360 --> 34:15.293
I feel like I've pooed me pants.

34:15.329 --> 34:16.157
Thanks.

34:18.435 --> 34:21.610
This is brilliant, isn't it,
Mike?

34:21.645 --> 34:22.438
- I know.

34:22.474 --> 34:23.268
Who would've thought it?

34:23.302 --> 34:24.130
Yesterday, we were nobodies.

34:24.165 --> 34:26.891
Today, we're stars in a film.

34:26.926 --> 34:28.411
- Think we'll get our name
in the credits at the end?

34:28.445 --> 34:30.239
- No, we're just extras.

34:30.275 --> 34:31.516
They don't put that, do they?

34:31.552 --> 34:33.036
- No, I think he's right, Mike.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.072
After all, it's like she said.

34:34.106 --> 34:35.556
If we weren't doing this scene
for them,

34:35.590 --> 34:36.971
their schedule would
be knackered

34:37.005 --> 34:38.973
'cause of old stroppy
bollocks in that caravan.

34:39.007 --> 34:42.010
I don't think he's right,
you know?

34:42.045 --> 34:44.289
I'm going to ask them
about that credits thing.

34:44.322 --> 34:45.635
I think they should.

34:45.668 --> 34:46.911
- I wouldn't bother, Les.

34:46.946 --> 34:49.087
No one's supposed to know
it's you anyway, remember?

34:49.121 --> 34:50.329
- Oh, yeah.

34:50.364 --> 34:51.226
- If you're gonna have a word
with them about anything,

34:51.261 --> 34:52.193
see if you can get
some bloody food.

34:52.228 --> 34:53.918
I'm starving.

34:53.953 --> 34:54.746
- Hang on.

34:54.782 --> 34:55.714
Here, Mike.

34:57.094 --> 34:57.888
All right, Bob.

34:57.923 --> 35:00.132
Get a load of this.

35:00.167 --> 35:04.309
- Whatever it is, Bob, I think
he's kept it warm for ya.

35:04.343 --> 35:06.690
- That better be a sausage, Les.

35:06.725 --> 35:08.347
- It is a sausage.

35:08.382 --> 35:10.142
Look, I've even wrapped it in
silver foil

35:10.177 --> 35:12.800
so you can warm it up.

35:12.834 --> 35:15.078
All you have to do is this.

35:19.013 --> 35:21.153
- Les, what are you doing?

35:22.810 --> 35:24.191
- It's clever, isn't it?

35:24.225 --> 35:26.089
Only need a
few minutes in there.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.608
Here you go, Mike.

35:30.852 --> 35:33.579
I'll put one in for you as well.

35:33.614 --> 35:34.960
- Les, you can't.

35:34.994 --> 35:36.237
- Actually, Mike, I think on
this occasion

35:36.272 --> 35:37.273
I'll take the chance.

35:37.307 --> 35:38.653
I'm bloody starving.

35:38.688 --> 35:39.861
Nice one, Les.

35:45.315 --> 35:47.731
- Anything from Heddlu Cymru?

35:48.836 --> 35:50.389
- Nothing, sir.

35:50.424 --> 35:53.047
Oh, but the Welsh police
did send this footage

35:53.081 --> 35:57.224
of that cameraman that was
killed from their investigation.

35:57.258 --> 35:59.502
Similar circumstances.

35:59.536 --> 36:02.229
They were shooting a
scene in a zoo near Wales,

36:02.263 --> 36:03.885
then this happened.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.923
[man screaming on tape]

36:06.957 --> 36:08.511
- Not great footage, is it?

36:08.545 --> 36:09.891
- No, it's crap.

36:09.926 --> 36:14.379
If you ask me, they're better
off without that cameraman.

36:14.413 --> 36:15.345
Sorry, sir.

36:17.313 --> 36:19.487
- Look at all the animals.

36:21.489 --> 36:24.872
They're going mental
over something.

36:24.906 --> 36:28.047
So is this when the
cameraman was killed then?

36:28.082 --> 36:28.945
- No, no.

36:28.979 --> 36:31.879
I think someone
got bitten or something.

36:31.913 --> 36:36.228
It was later that night when
the cameraman was killed.

36:36.263 --> 36:39.093
- So it wasn't
one of the animals.

36:40.439 --> 36:44.961
- No, not unless one
escaped from the zoo, sir.

36:44.995 --> 36:47.550
But it was some kind of animal.

36:48.516 --> 36:50.553
It was a real mess again, sir.

36:50.587 --> 36:53.107
There were intestines
everywhere.

36:53.141 --> 36:54.281
Some were missing.

36:54.315 --> 36:55.799
No human could do that.

36:55.834 --> 36:58.250
Guts strewn about the place.

36:58.285 --> 37:00.425
Blood gushing from every wound.

37:00.459 --> 37:01.598
The ribcage had been ripped.

37:01.633 --> 37:02.461
- Yeah, it's all right.

37:02.496 --> 37:03.324
Thank you.

37:05.361 --> 37:06.224
- Sorry.

37:13.852 --> 37:14.853
- An animal.

37:16.475 --> 37:18.684
An animal, Haskins.

37:18.719 --> 37:21.825
That could be what
we're looking for.

37:22.895 --> 37:23.758
Right.

37:23.793 --> 37:25.726
Get the lab to recheck
those bodies.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.003
- We've got a lab, sir?

37:27.037 --> 37:28.384
- Yes, we have.

37:28.418 --> 37:29.661
It's sort of...

37:30.696 --> 37:31.594
Yeah.

37:31.628 --> 37:33.975
And have a word with
the Welsh Heddlu,

37:34.010 --> 37:35.770
or whatever they're called.

37:35.805 --> 37:39.291
Get them to check the
cameraman's body as well.

37:39.326 --> 37:43.295
I want to see if there's
a hair, a tooth, anything.

37:43.330 --> 37:45.470
- They all had hair and teeth,
sir.

37:45.504 --> 37:46.402
Except the old fella.

37:46.436 --> 37:47.886
I don't think the
teeth were his.

37:47.920 --> 37:48.990
- Not theirs.

37:50.026 --> 37:51.441
What killed them.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.618
Can you roll that footage again?

37:55.652 --> 37:56.653
Just.

37:56.688 --> 37:57.516
Yeah.

38:06.594 --> 38:07.492
Stop there.

38:15.154 --> 38:16.639
- What is it, sir?

38:17.536 --> 38:18.986
- I need to piss.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.506
- [Toy] And this little
piggy went

38:21.540 --> 38:24.992
wee, wee, wee, wee, wee all the
way home.

38:26.718 --> 38:29.307
- Daddy, can you take
my music box, please?

38:29.341 --> 38:30.308
- Oh, thank you.

38:30.342 --> 38:33.103
I'll listen to it while riding.

38:33.138 --> 38:34.726
- Wear your helmet.

38:34.760 --> 38:35.692
- Yes, dear.

38:35.727 --> 38:36.797
- Don't yes, dear me.

38:36.831 --> 38:38.350
Steve's wearing his.

38:38.385 --> 38:40.421
It'll save your life and
you'll thank me for it.

38:40.456 --> 38:41.319
- Hiya.

38:43.079 --> 38:45.771
Oh, see you've got
music to cycle by today.

38:45.806 --> 38:48.084
- Yeah, Bella said
I've got to take it.

38:48.118 --> 38:49.327
- Cool.

38:49.361 --> 38:50.155
You ready then, Scott?

38:50.189 --> 38:50.983
- Yeah.

38:51.018 --> 38:51.915
Where are we going today then?

38:51.950 --> 38:52.985
- Over to the other
side of the moor.

38:53.020 --> 38:53.814
- What?

38:53.848 --> 38:54.711
That's miles away.

38:54.746 --> 38:56.092
- You said you wanted
to get fit.

38:56.126 --> 38:57.162
- That'll kill us.

38:57.196 --> 38:58.025
- Come on.

38:59.682 --> 39:00.959
- See you later.

39:00.993 --> 39:01.787
Bye.

39:01.822 --> 39:02.616
- Bye, Dad.

39:02.650 --> 39:03.444
- [Scott] Bye-Bye.

39:03.479 --> 39:04.859
- Bye.

39:04.894 --> 39:08.898
- How the fuck can they be
shooting the scene if I am here?

39:08.932 --> 39:10.071
Answer me that.

39:10.106 --> 39:11.314
- It's only a wide, Greg.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.800
- A fucking wide of the
fucking scene in which I behead

39:14.835 --> 39:18.183
25 of the living fucking dead
by myself.

39:19.115 --> 39:21.945
Me, the star of this
fucking film!

39:23.015 --> 39:26.398
So, how the fuck can your
fucking scene be shot

39:26.433 --> 39:29.367
and not include fucking me?

39:29.401 --> 39:30.920
- You were in your trailer,
Greg.

39:30.954 --> 39:32.784
- I was in my trailer?

39:34.233 --> 39:37.582
So you decide to carry on
without me?

39:37.616 --> 39:40.170
So what if the director
decides to take a piss?

39:40.205 --> 39:42.207
Someone else takes over?

39:46.453 --> 39:47.315
- Sir.

39:47.350 --> 39:48.834
Sir, look at this.

39:49.732 --> 39:54.288
[growling and screaming
on video]

39:54.322 --> 39:56.083
- This had better be important,
Haskins.

39:56.117 --> 39:56.911
What is it?

39:56.946 --> 39:58.326
- Look, sir.

39:58.361 --> 40:03.401
All the wilds dogs are snarling
and going mental, but look.

40:03.435 --> 40:05.437
They only seem to be
going mental

40:05.472 --> 40:08.475
and snarling at one person.

40:08.509 --> 40:09.407
- God, yes.

40:11.270 --> 40:13.169
- Just move it on a few frames.

40:13.203 --> 40:14.342
- No, I do.

40:14.377 --> 40:15.309
Yeah, just.

40:17.345 --> 40:18.174
- There.

40:20.176 --> 40:22.420
Jesus, look at those teeth.

40:23.351 --> 40:26.907
What the hell sort of dog
is that?

40:26.941 --> 40:29.841
Now that one there
is the director.

40:30.911 --> 40:33.016
They're all the same,
aren't they?

40:33.051 --> 40:34.224
What a bender.

40:39.091 --> 40:40.230
And that.

40:40.265 --> 40:44.442
That's the actor Greg
something from all the adverts.

40:46.685 --> 40:47.514
Christ.

40:48.411 --> 40:51.172
They're like catnip
to them dogs.

40:52.208 --> 40:53.036
Oh, god.

40:55.694 --> 40:59.180
It looks like that dog
thing really bites him.

40:59.215 --> 41:02.218
Looks like it takes a
bite out of them all.

41:02.252 --> 41:03.668
- Jeez.

41:03.702 --> 41:04.600
- Nasty.

41:04.634 --> 41:05.808
- Greg Lupeen.

41:07.154 --> 41:08.742
That's who that is.

41:10.019 --> 41:10.847
Right.

41:12.470 --> 41:17.475
I think we ought to go and
have a word with Greg Lupeen.

41:17.889 --> 41:22.514
I want to know what spooked
all those animals that night.

41:22.549 --> 41:23.411
Yeah.

41:25.137 --> 41:28.209
I also want to know what
happened in that cage

41:28.244 --> 41:29.970
that evening as well.

41:31.627 --> 41:33.560
Better bring your notebook.

41:33.594 --> 41:34.526
- Autograph?

41:34.561 --> 41:35.423
- Yep.

41:37.598 --> 41:38.599
Oh, Haskins.

41:43.570 --> 41:44.778
- Is something burning?

41:44.812 --> 41:46.262
- And what makes it worse
is that you were going

41:46.296 --> 41:49.610
to film it in secret while
I was locked in my trailer.

41:49.645 --> 41:50.853
- Something is burning.

41:50.887 --> 41:52.061
- The only thing that
should be burning

01:04:40.566 --> 01:04:42.119
- Is he as bad as the other one?

01:04:42.154 --> 01:04:44.225
- No, I don't think so.

01:04:44.259 --> 01:04:45.226
Look, sir.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.435
He was wearing his helmet.

01:04:48.367 --> 01:04:50.265
- Is he still alive?

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:51.922
- I think so, sir.

01:04:51.957 --> 01:04:54.891
I think the helmet
must've saved...

01:04:57.583 --> 01:04:58.411
No.

01:05:09.629 --> 01:05:12.115
[phone rings]

01:05:13.875 --> 01:05:14.703
- Severed Arms.

01:05:14.738 --> 01:05:16.119
Sorry, Dirty Hog.

01:05:17.361 --> 01:05:18.190
Yeah?

01:05:19.191 --> 01:05:20.019
Who?

01:05:21.607 --> 01:05:22.504
Les Jarvis.

01:05:24.023 --> 01:05:26.612
Yeah, I know who he is.

01:05:26.646 --> 01:05:28.269
Yeah, well he's here, so I'll
tell him.

01:05:28.303 --> 01:05:29.097
All right.

01:05:29.132 --> 01:05:30.443
Bye.

01:05:30.478 --> 01:05:31.686
- Full house.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.652
- Five kings.

01:05:32.687 --> 01:05:33.964
- Not again.

01:05:33.999 --> 01:05:36.518
- Apparently, producer
of the film wants to see

01:05:36.553 --> 01:05:38.624
the man who resembles
Greg Lupeen.

01:05:38.658 --> 01:05:39.728
- I thought me ears
were burning.

01:05:39.763 --> 01:05:41.351
- So you really do resemble him.

01:05:41.385 --> 01:05:43.318
- Why do they want to see me?

01:05:43.353 --> 01:05:44.733
- Sounds like you're
in the shit.

01:05:44.768 --> 01:05:46.080
- I wonder what for?

01:05:46.114 --> 01:05:47.253
- Oh, I don't know, Lesley.

01:05:47.288 --> 01:05:50.084
Maybe bringing down a
county's entire power supply.

01:05:50.118 --> 01:05:51.568
- Causing a small fire.

01:05:51.602 --> 01:05:52.983
- [Mike] Causing thousands
of pounds worth of damage

01:05:53.018 --> 01:05:54.536
to film equipment.

01:05:55.641 --> 01:05:57.056
- Being a twat.

01:05:57.091 --> 01:05:58.264
- Yeah.

01:05:58.299 --> 01:05:59.438
Electrocuting a film star.

01:05:59.472 --> 01:06:00.266
- That's all.

01:06:00.301 --> 01:06:01.095
- Oh, great.

01:06:01.129 --> 01:06:02.510
Blame Les.

01:06:02.544 --> 01:06:05.858
I bet they'll be blaming me
for his detached retina next.

01:06:05.892 --> 01:06:07.066
- Well, there's a good chance,
Lesley,

01:06:07.101 --> 01:06:09.931
as one, it was all
caused by you.

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:13.072
And two, it was all
caused by you.

01:06:13.107 --> 01:06:14.591
- What was B again?

01:06:14.625 --> 01:06:16.696
- You better get ready
to face the music, Les.

01:06:16.731 --> 01:06:17.904
- Oh, no need.

01:06:19.251 --> 01:06:20.942
Guess who's just walked in.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:22.288
- Go on.

01:06:22.323 --> 01:06:23.117
- Okay.

01:06:23.151 --> 01:06:24.670
Look who's just walked in.

01:06:24.704 --> 01:06:25.498
- Uh-oh.

01:06:25.533 --> 01:06:26.948
It's the main zombie film woman.

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:29.709
- Makeup's not very good, is it?

01:06:29.744 --> 01:06:32.471
- Can I have a word with you,
Mr. Jervis?

01:06:32.505 --> 01:06:33.334
- Jarvis.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:41.928
How are you, Alison?

01:06:41.963 --> 01:06:43.930
- I don't know about you,
Mr. Jervis.

01:06:43.965 --> 01:06:44.966
- Jarvis.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.382
- But I don't believe in
beating about the bush.

01:06:47.417 --> 01:06:48.314
- That's a surprise.

01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:51.179
I've heard all about
you film lot.

01:06:52.249 --> 01:06:53.940
- I'll come straight
to the point.

01:06:53.975 --> 01:06:55.563
We are in the shit.

01:06:56.495 --> 01:06:58.186
- Yep, like I said.

01:06:58.221 --> 01:06:59.981
- All right, Les.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.845
How can we help you?

01:07:01.879 --> 01:07:04.951
- As you probably know, Greg
Lupeen, the star of the film,

01:07:04.986 --> 01:07:06.953
has been incapacitated
and will be

01:07:06.988 --> 01:07:08.852
out of action for a while.

01:07:08.886 --> 01:07:10.164
Tomorrow we'll be announcing,

01:07:10.198 --> 01:07:11.958
that although he's
making progress,

01:07:11.993 --> 01:07:13.995
he will not be returning to
filming duties

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.618
on this particular production.

01:07:16.653 --> 01:07:17.619
- Sorry to hear that.

01:07:17.654 --> 01:07:18.931
I bet you've invested a lot
in this film.

01:07:18.965 --> 01:07:21.244
- You wouldn't believe how much.

01:07:21.278 --> 01:07:23.729
We have been blighted
with problems.

01:07:23.763 --> 01:07:26.318
First, the crew getting
attacked and bitten

01:07:26.352 --> 01:07:27.698
during the zoo shoot.

01:07:27.733 --> 01:07:29.286
Then, the death of a cameraman,

01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:31.909
some grizzly incident
near to our location.

01:07:31.944 --> 01:07:34.222
And now the hospitalization
of Greg.

01:07:34.257 --> 01:07:38.019
We have lost time, money,
and even equipment.

01:07:38.985 --> 01:07:42.334
We could stand to lose over
three million.

01:07:42.368 --> 01:07:45.440
Fortunately, all of Greg's
close-ups and action scenes

01:07:45.475 --> 01:07:47.718
had already been completed.

01:07:47.753 --> 01:07:51.964
So all we really need now are
some long shots, silhouettes,

01:07:51.998 --> 01:07:54.139
and profiles for the remainder.

01:07:54.173 --> 01:07:56.382
And this, Mr. Jarvis.

01:07:56.417 --> 01:07:57.245
- Jervis.

01:07:58.591 --> 01:08:01.318
- This is where you come in.

01:08:01.353 --> 01:08:03.182
- I've been here ages.

01:08:04.942 --> 01:08:06.875
Could I just have a
moment at the bar, please?

01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:08.222
- Oh, please do.

01:08:18.542 --> 01:08:20.372
- Well, I'm impressed, Lesley.

01:08:20.406 --> 01:08:22.684
For once you've taken the
time to understand something

01:08:22.719 --> 01:08:24.548
and think about it.

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:26.515
- I just wanted a pint.

01:08:28.656 --> 01:08:30.278
What was she going on about,
Mike?

01:08:30.313 --> 01:08:32.970
- They need you to fill in
for Greg Lupeen, you twat.

01:08:33.005 --> 01:08:34.247
They need you to
finish the film,

01:08:34.282 --> 01:08:36.871
otherwise they're in the shit.

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:39.011
You are holding the trumps.

01:08:39.045 --> 01:08:40.357
- Could you tell?

01:08:40.392 --> 01:08:41.496
I did squeak one out earlier,

01:08:41.531 --> 01:08:44.810
but I didn't think anyone
had heard it.

01:08:51.644 --> 01:08:55.337
- I still can't believe
this werewolf thing.

01:08:55.372 --> 01:08:58.064
Well, let's go see
our werewolf Mr. Lupeen

01:08:58.099 --> 01:08:59.652
in hospital, shall we?

01:08:59.687 --> 01:09:02.033
See if he's in a mood to talk.

01:09:02.068 --> 01:09:07.073
He might want to know that
we've found his latest victims.

01:09:07.626 --> 01:09:10.732
- Something else doesn't
add up with these cyclists.

01:09:10.767 --> 01:09:14.252
As well as why they were
up here in the first place.

01:09:14.287 --> 01:09:16.323
It's the time of death.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:18.430
You say you saw them alive,
Officer?

01:09:18.464 --> 01:09:19.258
- Yeah.

01:09:19.292 --> 01:09:20.432
Me and the DA did.

01:09:20.466 --> 01:09:21.984
That was when the DA told
them to get off the path.

01:09:22.019 --> 01:09:23.642
- Just tell her the time.

01:09:23.676 --> 01:09:24.470
- 10 till eight.

01:09:24.505 --> 01:09:26.747
- When we saw the cyclists.

01:09:27.886 --> 01:09:29.095
- 8:15.

01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:30.269
- Okay.

01:09:30.304 --> 01:09:32.478
Okay, listen up, everyone.

01:09:32.513 --> 01:09:35.274
I'm sure you've all
heard the stories by now

01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:38.069
that Greg Lupeen is the
chief suspect

01:09:38.104 --> 01:09:43.212
in a series of gruesome
murders by an alleged werewolf

01:09:43.247 --> 01:09:45.077
that took place in the woods.

01:09:45.111 --> 01:09:47.804
This is absolute nonsense.

01:09:47.837 --> 01:09:50.944
And please, do not talk
to the press about it.

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:55.363
Greg Lupeen has been
nowhere near the woods.

01:09:55.398 --> 01:09:57.814
He was also
hospitalized yesterday.

01:09:57.848 --> 01:09:59.609
So just to keep you in the loop,

01:09:59.643 --> 01:10:01.818
his condition improved
a little overnight,

01:10:01.852 --> 01:10:04.924
but he is not out of the woods
just yet.

01:10:04.959 --> 01:10:07.030
Not that he was in the woods.

01:10:07.064 --> 01:10:10.206
When I say out of the woods,
I mean...

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:17.247
I think we owe it to Greg and
to our investors, of course,

01:10:17.282 --> 01:10:19.111
to finish this movie.

01:10:19.145 --> 01:10:24.254
So we will be completing on
scenes 48 and 62 this evening

01:10:24.289 --> 01:10:27.913
using our new Greg
lookie-likie, Les Jervis.

01:10:29.328 --> 01:10:30.743
- Jarvis.

01:10:30.778 --> 01:10:31.710
- Whatever.

01:10:31.744 --> 01:10:34.368
Now, there may be a police
presence during

01:10:34.402 --> 01:10:37.405
these last few takes while an
investigation is carried out.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:41.754
So please, can you all be
as cooperative as possible

01:10:41.789 --> 01:10:45.102
and they will hopefully
be as quick as they can.

01:10:45.137 --> 01:10:49.383
We have been assured that the
power will be back on shortly.

01:10:49.417 --> 01:10:52.420
So let's finish this
movie for Greg.

01:10:54.491 --> 01:10:55.320
- Woo!

01:10:58.012 --> 01:10:59.427
- Wow.

01:10:59.462 --> 01:11:01.395
You're a sensation, Lesley.

01:11:01.429 --> 01:11:02.637
- I know.

01:11:02.672 --> 01:11:06.641
I've got the sweet smell of
success ringing in me ears.

01:11:06.676 --> 01:11:09.334
Did you hear what she said
about the police, Mike?

01:11:09.368 --> 01:11:10.749
I reckon they might want to
question us

01:11:10.783 --> 01:11:13.614
about that sausage
electrocuting Greg.

01:11:13.648 --> 01:11:14.684
Right.

01:11:14.718 --> 01:11:16.099
We've got to make sure
all our ducks

01:11:16.133 --> 01:11:19.378
are signing on the same page,
yeah?

01:11:19.413 --> 01:11:23.209
We need to avoid talking
to the police, okay?

01:11:24.521 --> 01:11:25.488
- Yes, Les.

01:11:25.522 --> 01:11:26.351
- Good.

01:11:29.146 --> 01:11:30.458
Where's Bob?

01:11:30.493 --> 01:11:31.942
- He's over there talking
to the police.

01:11:31.977 --> 01:11:32.805
- Shit.

01:11:40.019 --> 01:11:42.125
- You spoke to them 8:15?

01:11:45.646 --> 01:11:46.888
According to the ambulance crew,

01:11:46.923 --> 01:11:51.583
they responded to the phone
call from the studio at 7:02

01:11:52.825 --> 01:11:54.379
and took Mr. Lupeen
to the hospital

01:11:54.413 --> 01:11:57.485
where he was admitted at 7:41.

01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.626
You see, this is what doesn't
make sense.

01:12:00.661 --> 01:12:03.180
Greg Lupeen can't be your man.

01:12:04.872 --> 01:12:05.700
- Right.

01:12:07.702 --> 01:12:09.635
Let's get back to the film set.

01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:11.119
Haskins, the car.

01:12:11.154 --> 01:12:11.948
- Volvo.

01:12:11.982 --> 01:12:12.811
- I know what it is.

01:12:12.845 --> 01:12:13.674
Go get it.

01:12:29.931 --> 01:12:30.725
- Sorry, guys.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.140
The main power's back on now.

01:12:32.175 --> 01:12:33.487
Stand by, everyone.

01:12:33.521 --> 01:12:36.110
Just need a
few minutes to reset.

01:12:36.144 --> 01:12:37.007
Sorry, Bruce.

01:12:37.042 --> 01:12:38.802
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:38.837 --> 01:12:40.908
Okay, we need to
get this scene bagged

01:12:40.942 --> 01:12:43.151
and in the can quickly tonight,
people.

01:12:43.186 --> 01:12:44.808
And I do mean quickly.

01:12:44.843 --> 01:12:46.362
I want to wrap in 20 minutes.

01:12:46.396 --> 01:12:47.708
- Bruce, we've got a
couple of hours on this

01:12:47.742 --> 01:12:48.812
according to the schedule.

01:12:48.847 --> 01:12:49.951
- Yeah, not tonight, Alison.

01:12:49.986 --> 01:12:51.781
I'm a little concerned
about the light, all right?

01:12:51.815 --> 01:12:52.989
- It's a full moon.

01:12:53.023 --> 01:12:54.024
- Yeah, yeah.

01:12:54.059 --> 01:12:55.301
But it's just no good
from my point of view.

01:12:55.336 --> 01:12:56.820
It changes too many things.

01:12:56.855 --> 01:12:59.582
Let's just get this done before
it changes anything else.

01:12:59.616 --> 01:13:01.584
- Don't you want to wait till
the extra lights come back on?

01:13:01.618 --> 01:13:03.413
- There's no time.

01:13:03.448 --> 01:13:04.863
Just do it, okay?

01:13:09.246 --> 01:13:11.007
- There, Haskins.

01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:12.146
See that?

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.423
- Yep.

01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:14.320
Chip shop.

01:13:15.598 --> 01:13:19.049
Can I put the blues and twos on,
sir?

01:13:19.084 --> 01:13:20.706
- Go on then.

01:13:20.741 --> 01:13:22.294
- Yes.

01:13:22.328 --> 01:13:24.986
[siren wailing]

01:13:31.165 --> 01:13:32.097
- Oh, fuck.

01:13:33.167 --> 01:13:33.995
- What?

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.446
- Remember I wrapped that
sausage in silver foil

01:13:36.481 --> 01:13:38.034
and put it in the light for Bob?

01:13:38.068 --> 01:13:39.484
- I think we all remember that,
Lesley.

01:13:39.518 --> 01:13:41.347
- Yeah, well there were two.

01:13:41.382 --> 01:13:43.764
I put one in for you as well,
remember?

01:13:43.798 --> 01:13:45.110
- Oh, yeah.

01:13:45.144 --> 01:13:47.077
- Yours is in that one.

01:13:49.839 --> 01:13:50.736
- Oh, fuck.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.189
[oil bubbling]

01:13:57.329 --> 01:13:59.814
[tense music]

01:14:09.514 --> 01:14:10.653
- Clear the set!

01:14:10.687 --> 01:14:12.517
- Bruce, I thought we were
going to shoot the second.

01:14:12.551 --> 01:14:14.622
- Clear the set now!

01:14:14.657 --> 01:14:16.244
- Okay, you heard Bruce.

01:14:16.279 --> 01:14:17.073
Clear the set.

01:14:17.107 --> 01:14:18.039
We're going for a take.

01:14:18.074 --> 01:14:18.902
- No!

01:14:24.805 --> 01:14:26.979
[yelling]

01:14:32.537 --> 01:14:34.815
[growling]

01:14:51.866 --> 01:14:54.593
[people yelling]

01:14:56.112 --> 01:14:59.495
[dramatic music]

01:14:59.529 --> 01:15:01.738
[growling]

01:15:21.171 --> 01:15:23.726
[oil bubbling]

01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:35.634
- What the fuck do we do?

01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:37.429
- Show him your cross.

01:15:37.463 --> 01:15:39.776
- I am fucking cross.

01:15:39.811 --> 01:15:42.261
- He's not a fucking vampire.

01:15:45.713 --> 01:15:47.957
[growling]

01:15:56.344 --> 01:15:59.106
[people yelling]

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.213
Whoa!

01:16:03.248 --> 01:16:04.042
Fuck off!

01:16:09.703 --> 01:16:11.394
- Why is he running?

01:16:11.428 --> 01:16:13.983
Technically, he's already dead.

01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:21.059
Alison.

01:16:30.931 --> 01:16:32.760
- Fuck me, that's hot.

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:38.352
[dramatic music]

01:16:46.912 --> 01:16:49.156
[growling]

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.411
- What the hell?

01:17:03.446 --> 01:17:06.449
- I told you
they were like bullets.

01:17:08.554 --> 01:17:10.039
- A silver bullet.

01:17:13.939 --> 01:17:14.940
- Okay, listen up.

01:17:14.975 --> 01:17:16.908
You may all be in danger.

01:17:16.942 --> 01:17:17.771
- Uh-huh.

01:17:17.805 --> 01:17:19.704
- We know that Greg
is not the...

01:17:19.738 --> 01:17:20.601
Oh.

01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:25.710
[soft piano music]

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:37.549
Yes, well.

01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:40.863
We worked out that it couldn't
have been Greg Lupeen.

01:17:40.897 --> 01:17:44.729
Although, evidence did
clearly point that way.

01:17:44.763 --> 01:17:47.697
The recovered footage shows
that he was indeed attacked

01:17:47.732 --> 01:17:49.872
by those wild dogs
and it did appear

01:17:49.906 --> 01:17:52.564
that he was bitten by one.

01:17:52.598 --> 01:17:53.910
Hence our suspicion.

01:17:53.945 --> 01:17:58.121
However, we don't always
get it right the first time.

01:17:58.156 --> 01:17:59.019
- That's true.

01:17:59.053 --> 01:17:59.951
Remember when we sent
that fella down

01:17:59.985 --> 01:18:00.883
and he hadn't even done.

01:18:00.917 --> 01:18:01.987
- All right, Haskins.

01:18:02.022 --> 01:18:04.438
Do you want to go and tell
uniform at the hospital

01:18:04.472 --> 01:18:06.785
that he's free to return
to the station?

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.753
And you can tell
Mr. Lupeen that he's

01:18:08.787 --> 01:18:12.308
free to leave the hospital
as soon as he is able to.

01:18:12.342 --> 01:18:13.758
Yes, on closer...

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.832
Yes, on closer inspection,

01:18:19.902 --> 01:18:23.008
it appears that Bruce the
director was, in fact,

01:18:23.043 --> 01:18:25.114
bitten by one of these dogs,
too.

01:18:25.148 --> 01:18:28.704
And it was Bruce that had
become infected.

01:18:28.738 --> 01:18:30.671
Incredible as it seems.

01:18:40.992 --> 01:18:42.683
Werewolves do exist.

01:18:43.546 --> 01:18:44.374
Or did.

01:18:47.412 --> 01:18:49.828
Thank god we were at hand,
that's all I can say,

01:18:49.863 --> 01:18:53.142
to put an end to this
gruesome episode.

01:18:53.970 --> 01:18:57.422
I think the village can
rest assured once again

01:18:57.456 --> 01:19:00.701
that they are finally
living in safety.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:03.497
[machine beeping]

01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:07.466
They'll be no more murders
on my watch.

01:19:07.501 --> 01:19:08.329
Oh, no.

01:19:09.296 --> 01:19:10.642
Not on my watch.

01:19:14.197 --> 01:19:16.130
[roars]

01:19:16.165 --> 01:19:19.237
[uptempo rock music]
