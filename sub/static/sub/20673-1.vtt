Hey, come on, that
could happen. Totally.

06:55.542 --> 06:58.917

think he looks like
when he goes by?

Just a blur, I guess.
Exactly.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.333
And if he's going
fast enough,

07:04.333 --> 07:05.250
you wouldn't even
see him at all.

07:05.708 --> 07:07.750
As a matter of fact,
from Eddy's point of view,

07:07.750 --> 07:09.917
you would look as if
you're standing still.

on this project

we can go after dinner,
which is cool

13:18.542 --> 13:19.875

should still make it.

The car lot.

a Mustang convertible,

with a V8.

rated it a "best buy."

Okay, all right.
So what else have
you compared it to?

13:36.625 --> 13:37.542
Nothing. That's
the car I want, Dad.

gonna prove your case

the other data.
Thanks, honey.

13:41.708 --> 13:43.375

a clinical trial, Dad.

13:43.375 --> 13:44.583

if something's right,

13:44.583 --> 13:46.166
you gotta close your
eyes, grit your teeth
and hang on.

13:46.166 --> 13:49.583
No. No, you gotta step back,
weigh the options and make
a calculated choice.

to do your homework
on this, Zak.

is the car that you want

gonna be there
when you get back.

at it tonight. Just come
look at it tonight.

I gotta go over Dopler's
project tonight.

heard from him
in a week.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.792
I haven't, honey.
But I promised to get to it
before the conference.

14:06.792 --> 14:08.250

is about, isn't it?
What?

14:08.250 --> 14:10.917
This isn't even about
me looking at
other cars, is it?

14:10.917 --> 14:12.250
Zak, what are you
talking about?
Nothing!

14:13.417 --> 14:15.000
You always have time
for your students,

14:15.000 --> 14:16.458
and you never have
time for your own kids!

14:16.458 --> 14:18.667
Oh, now he's concerned
about me.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.333
Hey, I asked you
to come to
this conference.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.083
Who was the one
who said
he was too busy?

14:22.083 --> 14:24.417
The Congress
of Applied Science?

14:24.417 --> 14:25.875
There's fun for
the whole family!
Right?

14:25.875 --> 14:29.333
Stop it! Sit! Eat!

14:29.333 --> 14:32.208
Kelly, get off the phone.
KELLY: Okay.

14:32.208 --> 14:34.792
Come on, you guys.
Some of the greatest
peace treaties in history

14:34.792 --> 14:36.834
have been signed over
green beans
and beef stroganoff.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.542
I'm not hungry.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.625
Zak, look, I promise
I'll take you...
Tell it to Dopler.

14:43.542 --> 14:44.875
(SIGHS)

14:44.875 --> 14:46.125
(DOOR CLOSES)

14:55.000 --> 14:56.625
(BEEPING)

14:58.667 --> 15:01.125
Ugh! I don't know
how you work
in all this mess.

15:02.125 --> 15:03.458
(SIGHS)

15:05.333 --> 15:07.750
(CLATTERING)

15:07.750 --> 15:09.875
Honey, why did you
do that? I was gonna
fix that for you.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.959
Sweetheart,
I bought a new toaster
a year ago.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.959
Yeah, yeah, I know.

15:19.959 --> 15:22.000
I don't want to leave
with something like this
between Zak and me, either.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.542
But, it's just...

15:24.917 --> 15:26.625
Honey, he's got
so much potential

15:26.625 --> 15:28.834
and, yeah, yeah,
right now
he can skate by.

15:28.834 --> 15:31.083
But it's gonna
catch up to him.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.750
Maybe. But he's finding
his own way, George.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.500
And just because
it isn't your way

15:35.500 --> 15:37.500
doesn't mean that
he's... He's lost.

15:38.750 --> 15:40.542
Okay. Okay, uh...

15:40.542 --> 15:41.750
Let me just put
this back together,

15:41.750 --> 15:43.291
and I'll go up
and make peace.

15:43.291 --> 15:44.583
Okay.

15:46.417 --> 15:48.250
Now don't forget.
You know how
you get down here.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.000
No, no, I promise.
Two minutes, honey.

15:51.667 --> 15:52.834
(BEEPING)

15:55.667 --> 15:56.834
(BEEPS)

16:13.291 --> 16:15.208
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

16:16.583 --> 16:17.875
Come in.

16:21.875 --> 16:23.041
Hey.
Hey.

16:27.125 --> 16:28.542
So, uh,

16:30.417 --> 16:31.583
anything you want
to talk about
before I go?

16:31.583 --> 16:33.125
No. I'm good.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.708
Mmm-hmm.

16:37.291 --> 16:38.708
Well, uh...

16:39.417 --> 16:40.708
Uh...

16:42.083 --> 16:43.291
This is, uh...

16:44.750 --> 16:45.750
It's my itinerary
and, uh...

16:47.625 --> 16:49.750
My hotel in case
you need to get
in touch with me.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.417
Thanks.

16:55.166 --> 16:57.083
Have fun with your
science friends.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.250
What?

17:11.250 --> 17:12.625
We'll work it out
when I get back.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.250
(GUITAR PLAYING)

17:25.083 --> 17:28.458
MAN: Mr. Gates,
I don't make policy,
but I do enforce it.

17:28.458 --> 17:30.542
So they're shutting
me down?

17:30.542 --> 17:34.000
Hey, you knew
it was a black ops
contract.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.625
The administration
found out about it.
They want it to go away.

17:36.625 --> 17:39.125
Well, you need to
make them understand
the significance

17:39.125 --> 17:41.041
of what
we're doing here.

17:41.041 --> 17:43.959
Look, Gates, I supported
you on this as long
as I could.

17:44.625 --> 17:46.291
But they've got
a point.

17:46.291 --> 17:50.667
What if one of the Saddams
of the world gets
his hands on this stuff?

17:50.667 --> 17:53.208
The fact is, he could
waltz right through
an entire army,

17:53.208 --> 17:56.125
plant an A-bomb in
the President's bathtub

17:56.125 --> 17:59.000
and all of our smart bombs
and satellites would
be useless to stop him.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.375
I'm not even finished
building it.

18:01.375 --> 18:04.625
And they have me selling
it on the black market?
Is that it?

18:04.625 --> 18:09.708
Mr. Gates, the NSA
expects your research,
your equipment,

18:09.708 --> 18:11.500
the whole shooting match
crated and ready
for pickup on Monday.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.250
And if I'm not ready?

18:14.834 --> 18:16.667
We're taking it
whether you're ready
or not.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.333

Please step forward
for retinal scan.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.166
Have a nice day,
Henry Gates.

18:43.375 --> 18:45.166
You all right?
Yes. Why?

19:07.875 --> 19:09.625
GATES: How's he doing?
MAN: Seems okay.

19:09.625 --> 19:10.875
But he wrote that
about a half hour ago.

19:19.417 --> 19:20.875
How dramatic.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.708
And charming.

19:25.875 --> 19:28.083
All right,
bring him down.

19:54.834 --> 19:56.417
Hello, Dr. Dopler.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.750
How are things
in Hypertime?

20:01.291 --> 20:03.417
"How are things
in Hypertime?"

20:04.166 --> 20:06.250
Look at me, man!

20:06.250 --> 20:08.625
I've been in here a week.
It's like I've aged 20 years.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.458
At least 20,
maybe more.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.625
Oh, well, why don't you
just kill me now?

20:12.625 --> 20:15.208
GATES: I was hoping that
wouldn't be necessary.

20:15.208 --> 20:16.625
Besides,
it's your own fault.

20:16.625 --> 20:19.041
If you'd solved
the aging glitch in
the original design,

20:19.041 --> 20:20.875
we wouldn't have
had to bring you
back to build this.

20:20.875 --> 20:24.000
Oh, well,
the molecular stabilizer

20:24.000 --> 20:26.458
should be able to reverse
the aging effects
in Hypertime.

20:26.458 --> 20:31.000
But I'm having
a little trouble with
the program, and...

20:31.000 --> 20:33.625
Earl, the NSA
wants all our toys
in three days.

20:34.625 --> 20:36.667
Hey, they're toys, right?

20:36.667 --> 20:38.625
They don't know
the watches work yet,

20:38.625 --> 20:41.208
and I have no intention
of turning them over.

20:41.208 --> 20:43.375
Besides, how can
I enjoy the power
of Hypertime

20:43.375 --> 20:45.792
if every time I use it,
I end up looking old?

20:46.458 --> 20:47.458
Like you?

20:48.208 --> 20:50.291
I want this fixed
in 48 hours!

20:52.333 --> 20:54.750
Dude, that is impossible!

20:54.750 --> 20:56.500
Well, then I guess
I will have to kill you.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.834
(STAMMERING)
Wait, wait, wait.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.500
Maybe I could
do it faster.

21:07.708 --> 21:09.333
I mean, I'm still
waiting on some data
from a friend.

21:09.917 --> 21:11.000
A friend?

21:15.208 --> 21:18.500
Well, no, no. I mean,
we can trust this guy.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.166
He's on the outside,
but he's cool.

21:21.166 --> 21:22.917
He's my old
college professor.

21:22.917 --> 21:24.333
If anybody can crack
the math on this,
it's gotta be him.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.875
What data did
you send him?

21:30.250 --> 21:31.834
Actually, I, uh...

21:33.166 --> 21:34.375
I sent him a watch.

21:34.959 --> 21:36.542
You idiot!

21:41.083 --> 21:42.375
I want that watch back.

fix this for me so
I could sell it. Figures!

You know, when your
father's old and gray,

22:15.708 --> 22:18.291
you're gonna regret
not having a better
relationship with him.

22:18.291 --> 22:19.417
There's plenty
of time for that.

22:21.458 --> 22:22.583
Mmm.

22:27.750 --> 22:30.000
Where are you guys going?
I made breakfast.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.750

some bad lunch meat?

22:49.750 --> 22:52.083
I hear you signed up
for the spin-off tonight.
Yeah.

22:52.083 --> 22:54.333
Hey, Ditmar,
lay off.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.625
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo.
I ain't on him,
all right?

22:56.333 --> 22:59.041
Listen up here, buddy.

22:59.041 --> 23:01.542
Tonight, it's just gonna
be me and you
up there on stage.

23:01.542 --> 23:03.208
You're not gonna have
your little sister here
backing you up.

23:03.208 --> 23:04.834
(STAMMERING)
What was that?

23:04.834 --> 23:06.125

A-go, Meeker!"

cool him off!

I'm spinning at
underground tonight.
Wanna come?

23:27.125 --> 23:28.458
You're not gonna
leave me hanging
out there alone tonight?

23:28.458 --> 23:31.542
No, dude, I'll be there.
I'll be there.

23:31.542 --> 23:34.792
(SIGHS)
Relax. He probably
blows anyway, man.

23:34.792 --> 23:36.625
I gotta go do something
about this. Here.

No, it's so very hard
for me, but...

23:43.500 --> 23:45.667
Oh, yeah?
But I try to watch
and learn.

23:45.667 --> 23:47.000
Oh, I'm sure you do.
Like this!

All right,
make a hole, boys.

23:51.667 --> 23:53.834
Uh-huh. Sure.
I got a hole for you.

23:56.375 --> 23:59.250
Hey!
That's a perfectly
good trashcan!

23:59.250 --> 24:00.917
Don't be throwing
students at it.
Come on.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.291
Both of you, out.
Come on.

24:02.291 --> 24:04.083
You okay?
ZAK: Yeah, I'm okay.

24:04.083 --> 24:06.750
RICK: Is he okay?
Yeah, yeah. Turn around.

24:06.750 --> 24:09.208
He started it.
I don't care who started it.
You finished it.

I didn't need any help.

Oh, well,
I wasn't, uh...

24:14.333 --> 24:16.917
I wasn't. I was looking
for my buddy's retainer
in the garbage.

Yeah, these band freaks
always, you know...

24:19.834 --> 24:23.542
(BOTH LAUGH)
Right. Very nice. Now,
if you'll excuse me...

24:23.542 --> 24:25.542
Oh, okay. Well,
hey, hey, since I...

24:25.542 --> 24:27.708
Since I have you here,
I'd just like to apologize

24:27.708 --> 24:29.875
for being such a loser
yesterday, okay?

24:29.875 --> 24:31.708
Only yesterday?
No, every day.

24:32.875 --> 24:35.750
Hey, I'll apologize
for global warming

24:35.750 --> 24:36.625
if you'll give me
another chance.

24:38.375 --> 24:41.125
I'm sorry.
I have plans.

24:41.125 --> 24:44.041
Okay, how about
after your plans?
I have more plans.

24:44.041 --> 24:45.917
Uh, would it be
such a stretch

24:45.917 --> 24:47.792
for maybe some
of your plans
to include me?

24:47.792 --> 24:50.500
(BELL RINGING)
All right.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.375
I guess we all deserve
a second chance.
Yeah.

24:53.333 --> 24:56.083
Here's my address.
Ah.

24:56.083 --> 24:58.875
The only thing is that
I have to baby-sit
my little brother and sister.

24:58.875 --> 25:00.792
But you can come by
around 4:00.
Okay.

25:00.792 --> 25:03.333
Okay. Yeah. 4:00.

25:03.333 --> 25:06.000
(STAMMERING)
I mean, that's probably
okay, I think.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.542
Okay, so
I'll see you then.

25:07.542 --> 25:08.750
Great.

25:20.125 --> 25:22.417
♪ There's every good reason

25:24.083 --> 25:25.792
♪ For letting it go

25:28.458 --> 25:30.417
♪ She's sneaky
and smoked out

25:32.500 --> 25:34.250
♪ And it's starting to show

25:36.792 --> 25:39.083
♪ I'll never let you go... ♪

25:42.333 --> 25:44.291
So I thought
maybe we could
spend some time

25:44.291 --> 25:45.834
by the pool
while the sun's
still nice.

25:45.834 --> 25:47.625
Yeah.
Works for me.

Great.
Mmm-hmm.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.125
There's another rake
over there.

25:53.125 --> 25:54.458
Uh, rake?

25:55.875 --> 25:58.792
Um, right, right.
Um...

25:58.792 --> 26:02.500
When I said second chance,
I was thinking like, uh,

26:02.500 --> 26:05.458
dinner and a movie
or a cup of coffee,
you know?

26:05.458 --> 26:07.959
I told you I had plans,
and you asked if they
could include you.

26:09.708 --> 26:11.458
Yeah, I did,
didn't I?

26:11.458 --> 26:13.834
Yes, you did.
Yeah.

26:13.834 --> 26:16.125
Look at it this way.
You go to the movies,

26:17.041 --> 26:19.000
you can't have
a conversation.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.500
You go out for coffee,
there's always a lull.

26:21.500 --> 26:25.208
This way,
when there's a lull,
at least my leaves get raked.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.667
Um, yeah, well,
are you gonna do
the whole thing by hand?

26:29.333 --> 26:32.417
Yeah. My father says
it develops self-discipline.

26:32.417 --> 26:34.834
That's what people always
say when they want you
to do stuff for free.

26:34.834 --> 26:36.333
(LAUGHS)

41:27.000 --> 41:29.291
Hey, forget that!
Forget that!

41:29.291 --> 41:32.000
Hey, Leslie Miller
has a slumber
party tonight.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.959
You know she got that pool,
and the girls get naked.

41:34.959 --> 41:36.959
(ALL LAUGHING)
Hey!

41:36.959 --> 41:38.959
Or, hear me out,
we could go to Vegas!

41:38.959 --> 41:42.125
BOTH: Go to Vegas.
No, no, no, no!

41:42.125 --> 41:43.625
Genius, hey, hey, hey,
we're not going
anywhere, okay?

41:43.625 --> 41:44.708
We're not going
anywhere, okay?

41:44.708 --> 41:47.166
My dad finds out
that I took the watch,

41:47.166 --> 41:48.083
I'm gonna be
grounded forever, so...

41:49.500 --> 41:50.750
Man!

41:51.583 --> 41:52.917
It's right up here.
Okay.

42:00.333 --> 42:01.750
You gotta
be kidding me.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.083
(CLEARS THROAT)
Oh, all right,
fine, fine, fine.

42:07.083 --> 42:08.583
I can take
a hint. Okay.

42:12.750 --> 42:14.333
Hey, guys, come on.

42:14.333 --> 42:15.333
You sure you
don't want me
to come with you?

42:15.333 --> 42:17.291
I got this plan...
What... What...

42:17.291 --> 42:18.959
Hey! Okay, man!
(CHUCKLING)

42:19.875 --> 42:21.583
See you Monday,

42:22.583 --> 42:24.166
Good night.
Yeah, okay, okay.

42:24.166 --> 42:26.166
Y'all have fun

Oh, yeah,
that's funny, Zak!
That's real funny!

42:32.417 --> 42:34.542
Hey, man, you're abusing
your powers,
I'm telling you!

42:34.542 --> 42:36.667
I'm gonna call
the Super Friends
on you, man!

42:36.667 --> 42:39.458
Oh, it's going down!
Oh, you wait and see!
I'm gonna get you for this!

42:50.166 --> 42:52.834
(SIGHS) So?
So...

42:52.834 --> 42:55.792
That didn't turn out
so bad after all,
Mr. Second chance man.

42:55.792 --> 42:57.959
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

42:57.959 --> 43:00.208
Well, you know,
the way I figure it,
if you make

43:00.208 --> 43:03.667
really bad first impression
things can only
get better from there.

43:03.667 --> 43:06.333
Right. And you take
the prize on both counts.
(CHUCKLES)

43:09.542 --> 43:11.834
Well, I...
I better go.

43:13.500 --> 43:14.667
Now?
Yeah.

43:18.834 --> 43:20.917
(DOORS CLOSE)

43:20.917 --> 43:22.792
At midnight, my father
blinks the porch light,

43:22.792 --> 43:24.333
and I turn back
into a pumpkin.

43:25.417 --> 43:28.333
Yeah, I should
probably go too.

43:28.333 --> 43:30.166
Although midnight
could be a pretty
long time off.

43:30.583 --> 43:32.667
Stop that.

43:32.667 --> 43:34.917
What do you think,
that magic watch
is gonna get you a kiss?

43:34.917 --> 43:37.500
No! I... I just
wanted to spend
more time with you.

43:37.500 --> 43:40.000
Shh. You don't
need magic.

43:54.417 --> 43:56.208
What?

43:56.208 --> 43:57.208
I wanted to kiss you.

43:59.041 --> 44:00.542

to kill you, man!

46:41.542 --> 46:42.625
Why? What did I do?

46:42.625 --> 46:44.792
Because you showed up!

46:44.792 --> 46:47.125
And you're running around
with something that's
not supposed to exist.

46:47.125 --> 46:49.208
Now, grab those wires
under the dash.

Uh, okay, strip the red wire
with your teeth

47:01.708 --> 47:04.708
and touch it to
the steering column.

47:04.708 --> 47:07.375
Come on, hurry up, man!
Just bite it,
bite it, bite it!

You don't wanna know.

What were they
shooting at me?
Liquid nitrogen.

to gnaw off my hand.

trying to kill you too?

probably up for a

56:37.500 --> 56:41.208
I don't even know.
I'm... I... I'm sorry.

56:41.208 --> 56:43.708
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have come here.
Espera.

56:43.708 --> 56:47.291
Wait. Slow down.
Come over here
and just relax.

56:49.458 --> 56:51.792
I'm glad that
you came. I am.

56:51.792 --> 56:54.166
But if we're
gonna be friends,

56:54.166 --> 56:56.291
you have to tell me
what is happening.

57:02.542 --> 57:07.500
(ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING)

57:13.834 --> 57:15.708
I told my brother I was
getting the car washed,
so bring it back clean.

57:16.583 --> 57:17.834
Okay.

57:19.333 --> 57:22.667
Um, I can't... I can't
thank you enough.

57:25.250 --> 57:26.834
Call me when
you find him?
Yeah.

58:01.792 --> 58:02.750
What are you doing?

58:04.500 --> 58:06.542
You raked my leaves.
I can't let you go alone.

58:19.625 --> 58:22.458
I just feel like
such an idiot.
He's been calling all day.

58:22.458 --> 58:24.583
This is the first chance
I've had to check
my messages.

58:24.583 --> 58:27.500
George, listen. Calm down.

58:27.500 --> 58:30.917
The police
want you to stay there
in case Zak calls again.

58:30.917 --> 58:32.834
Believe me,
if he shows up here,
I'll let you know.

58:32.834 --> 58:34.917
If he's giving you
any trouble,
I can talk to him.

58:35.625 --> 58:37.792
Fine.

58:37.792 --> 58:39.750
I just feel helpless,
sitting here waiting.

58:39.750 --> 58:40.792
Welcome to the club!

58:42.333 --> 58:45.000
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
It's just...
I've been everywhere
trying to track him down,

58:47.000 --> 58:48.834
and we couldn't reach you.

58:48.834 --> 58:50.750
All right. All right.
Let's go over your list.

58:55.834 --> 58:59.583
Hi. I need the room number
for Dr. George Gibbs.

58:59.583 --> 59:01.166
He's here
with the convention.

59:01.166 --> 59:02.417
And you are?

59:04.708 --> 59:06.125

Good.

59:23.834 --> 59:25.125
Let me see
what I can do.
Yeah.

59:29.625 --> 59:32.708
I just never should
have left with something
like this between us.

59:32.708 --> 59:35.125
Did he say anything
else that might
explain his behavior?

59:35.125 --> 59:37.291
Not really. I mean,
he rambled on a little bit

59:37.291 --> 59:39.125
when he came to, but...

59:39.125 --> 59:41.542
Oh, wait.

59:41.542 --> 59:44.875
He did say something about
his watch being a molecular
accelerator or something.

59:44.875 --> 59:48.166
Molecular accelerator?

59:48.166 --> 59:49.875
Jenny, honey, listen.
I need you to go downstairs
and look on the shelf

59:49.875 --> 59:52.750
above my desk.
There should be a box
with a watch in it.

59:52.750 --> 59:55.250
See if it's still
there, will you?
What's going on?

59:55.250 --> 59:56.834
I'll tell you in a minute.
Just check the box, okay?

59:57.667 --> 59:59.000
Just a minute.

Yeah.

You know, I usually
don't like to meet
a boy's father this soon,

01:00:46.959 --> 01:00:48.375
but for you...

01:00:50.208 --> 01:00:51.708
Hey, uh,

01:00:53.625 --> 01:00:54.959
do you think maybe
while we're up there,

01:00:54.959 --> 01:00:57.542
you can tell him that
taking the watch
was your idea?

this is about,
it's gonna have to wait

didn't mention your name.

If the watch makes you age,
then how come we haven't
gotten older?

Because you weren't
in Hypertime long enough.

What makes you think
that Gates has my dad
locked up in Hypertime?

01:06:12.208 --> 01:06:14.250

to replace me.

This is freaking me out too.

But your dad taught me
everything I know.

I mean, your dad
is like a father to me.

from the feds.

you'd like to help.

I didn't say that
we were that close.

Oh. (CHUCKLES)
Okay. Fine.

Well, then I can just
drop you off at QT.

I'm sure Gates
would love to
have you back.

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:01.083

we just need

can you make that thing
go any faster?

What is it with you
wacky kids today?

01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:12.041

ever fast enough.

Oh, great.
We're out of gas.

01:09:15.041 --> 01:09:16.875

We'll never get in that way.

he drew this.

01:10:02.959 --> 01:10:05.250
Sorry it's so rough.
I didn't have
my protractor.

01:10:07.667 --> 01:10:11.083
Okay, um,
there's gotta be
another entrance.

01:10:11.083 --> 01:10:14.041
Let's just, uh,
step back and look
at our options.

01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:15.625

to sound like your dad.

Shut up.
I'm nothing like him.

01:10:19.708 --> 01:10:21.708
Oh, come on. I meant it
as a compliment. All right?

01:10:21.708 --> 01:10:23.625
You don't have
to blow your RAM.

01:10:23.625 --> 01:10:26.041
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
What's this?

01:10:26.041 --> 01:10:27.375
What's under here?
Is that like a sewer?

01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:29.375
Ventilation, but close.

01:10:29.375 --> 01:10:30.792
Well, can we
get in that way?

01:10:30.792 --> 01:10:34.000
Yeah, sure, if you don't
mind getting ginsu-ed
by the intake fan.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.959
Now, uh, please,
give me the new watch.
Here.

01:10:36.375 --> 01:10:37.667
There we go.

01:10:38.333 --> 01:10:39.792

give a dude time

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:03.458

It's unbelievable.

ought to do it.

Here's the map.
This is as far as I go.

01:13:07.125 --> 01:13:10.375
We had a deal.
Look, man, I'm scared.

01:13:10.375 --> 01:13:12.542
Okay? And if you went
through what I've
been through,

01:13:12.542 --> 01:13:14.792
this place would give
you the willies, too.

01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:17.959
I can't go in there,
Zak-man.

01:13:19.583 --> 01:13:20.959
So he was like a
father to you, right?

01:13:20.959 --> 01:13:23.792
Hey, that's low.
And if you hadn't taken
the watch to begin with,

01:13:23.792 --> 01:13:24.500
he wouldn't even
be in there.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.083
What are you
talking about?

01:13:26.083 --> 01:13:30.375

at risk when you sent
him that watch.

The truth is
that man in there

gave his life to
students like you.

He treated you like a son.

01:13:42.834 --> 01:13:45.166
And now, what? He needs
something in return
and it's too much for you?

I am his son.

01:13:48.333 --> 01:13:49.500

to find out

brilliant as everyone

Aw, Zak, no, no.

with them so that
they'd leave you alone.

leave you here to die.

to come join me?

help you, you don't

your life in the hands

what I had in mind.

It was never because
I care more about
my students.

01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:17.583
Sir, we got a problem.
We can't get in.

01:21:17.583 --> 01:21:19.583
The access code to
the molecular stabilizer
has been changed.

01:21:21.834 --> 01:21:24.291
GATES:  Very clever, Dr. Gibbs.

01:21:25.708 --> 01:21:27.625
You changed
the access code.

01:21:28.708 --> 01:21:30.959
But I thought
we had an agreement.

01:21:30.959 --> 01:21:33.291
I let your son live
if you cooperate.

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:36.500
Well, it's time
to renegotiate.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.959
He and the girl go free,
then you get your access code.

01:21:39.291 --> 01:21:40.333
Fine.

01:21:42.083 --> 01:21:43.875
Get those kids
out of there,

01:21:43.875 --> 01:21:45.500
and then bring
that old man to me.

01:21:46.625 --> 01:21:48.667
GEORGE: Zak,
what are you doing?

01:21:48.667 --> 01:21:50.000
Finishing what
I came here to do.
Come here.

01:21:53.834 --> 01:21:56.875
Gates took your watch.
Gates took a watch.

01:21:56.875 --> 01:21:58.625
He'd probably
get $10 for it on eBay.

01:21:58.625 --> 01:21:59.291
I switched them
in the elevator.

01:22:04.834 --> 01:22:06.333
(GRINDING)

01:22:08.208 --> 01:22:10.708
Zak, you can't accelerate
when you're already
in Hypertime.

01:22:10.708 --> 01:22:12.083
You'll be going too fast.
It could kill you.

01:22:12.083 --> 01:22:13.041
We don't have
a choice.
No, Zak!

01:22:13.041 --> 01:22:14.208
(BOTH ARGUING)

01:22:14.208 --> 01:22:15.542
We don't have a choice.

01:22:15.542 --> 01:22:16.834
(BEEPS)

01:22:24.166 --> 01:22:25.375
Oh!

01:22:26.083 --> 01:22:27.500
Unbelievable.

01:22:30.166 --> 01:22:31.667
Your molecules are
moving so fast,

01:22:31.667 --> 01:22:33.667
your hand went right
through the table.

01:22:35.625 --> 01:22:37.000
Are you okay?

01:22:41.583 --> 01:22:43.000
I have no idea.

01:23:22.291 --> 01:23:23.875
Here we go.

01:23:23.875 --> 01:23:25.625
Sir, we got a
problem in there.

01:23:25.625 --> 01:23:27.417
The kid is doing
something freaky.

01:23:27.417 --> 01:23:29.083
Well, bring him down!

01:23:51.125 --> 01:23:51.917
You know what to do.

01:24:03.417 --> 01:24:04.250
Hi.

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:08.625
Mr. Gates!

01:24:31.542 --> 01:24:32.792
(HISSING)

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:25.834
Come on. Let's
get out of here.

01:25:28.959 --> 01:25:30.834
Zak. Your plan worked.

01:25:33.166 --> 01:25:34.792
(GRUNTS)

01:25:34.792 --> 01:25:35.708
ZAK: Let's get
out of here, come on.

01:25:41.041 --> 01:25:41.875
Hey!

01:25:44.417 --> 01:25:46.208
Say good night,
little man.
No!

01:25:50.583 --> 01:25:51.708
Good night, little man.

01:25:52.458 --> 01:25:54.083
(SCREAMING)

01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:59.208
Yeah. It hurts, doesn't it?

01:26:02.959 --> 01:26:04.208
Thank you.

01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:14.583
I'll take that,
thank you.

01:26:43.834 --> 01:26:46.250
So, what do you have
in mind for our next date?

01:26:47.625 --> 01:26:48.917
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

01:26:56.208 --> 01:26:57.792
Dopler, listen,

01:26:57.792 --> 01:26:59.125
next time you need help
with your math homework,

01:26:59.125 --> 01:27:00.792
don't call me.
Yeah.

01:27:00.792 --> 01:27:02.542
Uh, Dr. G.

01:27:02.542 --> 01:27:04.333
Uh...

01:27:04.333 --> 01:27:07.291
Did you ever get this
little anti-aging
gizmo working?

01:27:07.291 --> 01:27:09.625
'Cause I don't wanna
stay like this forever.

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:11.625
Forget about it.
I never got a chance
to test it.

01:27:26.834 --> 01:27:28.291
(TYPING)

01:27:32.667 --> 01:27:35.625
Oh! Oh, thank god
you're okay.

01:27:38.375 --> 01:27:40.583
Oh! What happened?

01:27:40.583 --> 01:27:42.583
It's okay. It's okay.

01:27:42.583 --> 01:27:44.917
I'm just a little more
distinguished, that's all.

01:27:44.917 --> 01:27:46.708
Where's Zak?

01:27:46.708 --> 01:27:48.834
Oh, uh, he'll
be here in a minute.

01:27:48.834 --> 01:27:50.083
He had to make
a little stop.
What?

01:27:50.083 --> 01:27:52.708
No, no.
He's just fine.

01:27:52.708 --> 01:27:55.500
Daddy! Daddy!
Oh, honey, it's
so good to see you.

01:27:56.333 --> 01:27:57.500
(ENGINE REVVING)

01:27:58.083 --> 01:27:59.333
There he is.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.458
Oh, Zak!

01:28:04.458 --> 01:28:06.166
Oh, thank god
you're okay.

01:28:07.583 --> 01:28:09.000
You must be
Francesca.
Hi.

01:28:10.166 --> 01:28:12.250
Hey, creepy.
Nice ride.

01:28:12.250 --> 01:28:13.834
I hear you're
a big hero now.

01:28:13.834 --> 01:28:16.458
Well, I wouldn't
say hero, but...

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:18.208
Hey, look,
I'm not gonna
be nice all day,

01:28:18.208 --> 01:28:19.041
so enjoy it.
Okay.

01:28:20.041 --> 01:28:21.458
Hey, who's that?

01:28:21.458 --> 01:28:25.041
Actually, honey,
there's something I forgot
to tell you on the phone.

01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:27.125
We had a little
problem at the lab.

01:28:27.125 --> 01:28:29.708
I guess we're gonna have
some company for a while.

01:28:29.708 --> 01:28:32.041
Oh, hey, Mrs. G.
How's it hangin'?

01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:33.750
Dopler?

01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:35.208
Hello, gorgeous.
No!

01:28:37.792 --> 01:28:39.959
Over. Over.

01:28:39.959 --> 01:28:41.375
More. More.

01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:42.542
Come on.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.208
Hit it. Let's see what
this thing can do.

01:28:48.208 --> 01:28:49.375
Yeah!

01:28:49.375 --> 01:28:50.875
(ENGINE REVVING)

01:28:56.708 --> 01:28:57.875
(MOUTHING "LOVE YOU")

01:29:00.250 --> 01:29:01.458
Buckle up!

01:29:02.125 --> 01:29:03.750
(TIRES SQUEALING)

01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:08.125
Wait! Wait!
