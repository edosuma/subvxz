00:01.800 --> 00:03.400
Hey, Charlie, would you
see who that is?!

00:11.300 --> 00:12.600
It's Death!

00:13.700 --> 00:14.700
Hi, Mom!

00:17.900 --> 00:19.800
Your gardener left this
in the driveway.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.000
It wasn't a gardener,
it was a girl with a grudge.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.900
So how
was your friend's funeral?

00:28.900 --> 00:31.100
Oh! Terribly disappointing.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.600
Yeah, in my experience,

00:32.600 --> 00:35.100
nothing kills a party
like a dead broad in a box.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.100
Don't be glib, Charlie.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.000
Hello, Alan.

00:40.300 --> 00:41.300
Oh, hey, Mom.

00:41.300 --> 00:42.800
Wow, you look nice.

00:43.300 --> 00:45.200
Yes, mourning becomes me,
doesn't it?

00:45.600 --> 00:47.400
If only more
of my friends would die.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.000
I'm sure the feeling's mutual.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.700
Charlie, as long
as you're over there,

00:53.700 --> 00:55.000
make Mommy a drink.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.900
It's been
a very depressing afternoon.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.500
Thanks for spreading
it around.

00:59.300 --> 01:02.100
Can you believe,
two of Cynthia's three children

01:02.500 --> 01:05.099
didn't even bother showing up
at her funeral?

01:05.400 --> 01:08.500
And the one who did was drunk
and cracking tasteless jokes

01:08.600 --> 01:10.500
about his mother
all throughout the service.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.600
You didn't happen
to jot any of them
down, did you?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.100
And it wasn't just the children.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.100
The crowd was very sparse

01:20.200 --> 01:22.700
and there
was virtually no mournin

01:23.000 --> 01:24.200
Well, that's understandable,
isn't it?

01:24.300 --> 01:25.600
You said no one really liked
this woman.

01:25.700 --> 01:28.200
Oh, she was a hateful shrew,
but still.

01:29.700 --> 01:30.700
Fortunately,

01:30.700 --> 01:32.600
I was able to draw
on my theater background

01:32.600 --> 01:33.800
and work up a good cry.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.500
Sense-memory.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.000
I remember the time

01:38.400 --> 01:41.100
<i>I wasn't cast as Blanche Dubois
in Streetcar.</i>

01:42.000 --> 01:43.300
You're a good friend, Mom.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.700
I know. I'm just glad
that when my time comes,

01:47.700 --> 01:50.500
I won't have such
a humiliating sendoff.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.100
Right?

01:55.200 --> 01:56.900
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Of course.

01:58.400 --> 01:59.800
Well, I'm going
to go eshen up.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.800
Even fake tears can ruin
one's mascara.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.100
Speaking of which,

02:04.100 --> 02:06.000
whoever did Cynthia's makeup
should be shot

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
and buried beside her.

02:07.100 --> 02:09.199
She looked
like a varnished clown.

02:10.699 --> 02:12.200
You'll go to Mom's
funeral, won't you?

02:13.800 --> 02:16.000
Of course.
As the eldest son,

02:16.000 --> 02:20.400
it's my obligation
to pound in the stake.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.300
Typical--
nothing for Alan to do.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.900
Okay, you can
cut off her head

02:24.900 --> 02:26.900
and hold it up
for the villagers.

02:27.700 --> 02:30.500
www.1000fr.com present

02:30.600 --> 02:33.600
sync:FRM@Ó²°î°î

02:33.700 --> 02:34.500
What are you doing?

02:35.200 --> 02:37.400
Leaving before Mom gets out
of the bathroom.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.700
I thought we were taking her
to dinne

02:39.900 --> 02:41.500
I can't listen to her anymore.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.400
It just blows my mind
that she can go on and on

02:44.400 --> 02:46.200
about her toxic friend's
sad little funeral

02:46.200 --> 02:49.200
when we both know she's going
to end up exactly the same way!

02:49.300 --> 02:50.100
I don't disagree,

02:50.600 --> 02:52.200
but there's an option
to running away from her.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.600
Yeah, but we'd get caught

02:53.600 --> 02:55.100
and you'd sell me out
for a reduced sentence.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.900
<i>We could tell
her the truth;</i>

02:58.200 --> 03:00.000
that she's just as toxic
as her late friend

03:00.100 --> 03:02.200
and that that's the way
she's gonna be remembered.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.900
Are you on crack?

03:06.900 --> 03:09.100
Maybe if she realized
how people see her,

03:09.200 --> 03:10.800
she might make an effort
to change.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.800
If she realized how people
see her,

03:12.800 --> 03:14.800
she'd just get new people.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.000
What are we
gonna say, Alan?

03:17.100 --> 03:18.500
"Hey, Mom,
you're a crazy she-bat

03:18.600 --> 03:20.300
"and the only way people will
come to your funeral

03:20.400 --> 03:21.200
"is if your delighted sons

03:21.300 --> 03:22.700
"turn it into
a three-day beer bash

03:22.800 --> 03:24.100
with go-go dancers."

03:25.600 --> 03:27.000
We, we wouldn't start there.

03:28.200 --> 03:31.600
All right, Cynthia's
in the ground, my face is on,

03:31.700 --> 03:34.000
I look stunning in black;

03:35.500 --> 03:37.000
Just follow my lead.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.900
Um, Mom...?

03:40.100 --> 03:40.900
Yes, dear.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.700
Alan thinks you're
a crazy she-bat

03:47.800 --> 03:49.400
and no one will mourn
at your funeral either

03:53.200 --> 03:55.700
We're telling you this
because we love you.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.200
I see.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.000
Look, Mom, you have to realize

04:01.100 --> 04:03.800
that you're not that
different from Cynthia.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.200
I most certainly am!

04:06.400 --> 04:08.700
Come on, Mom,
you speak ill of everyone,

04:08.800 --> 04:10.300
even your
closest friends.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.700
You, you manipulate people,

04:11.800 --> 04:13.900
you're an unbelievable
narcissist,

04:13.900 --> 04:15.100
you're self-obsessed...

04:15.200 --> 04:16.800
That's a bit redundant,
isn't it?

04:17.100 --> 04:19.399
You find fault with everything,

04:20.700 --> 04:22.500
...and frankly,
I don't know anyone

04:22.600 --> 04:24.300
who enjoys spending time
with you,

04:24.400 --> 04:26.500
let alone would cry
at your funeral.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.000
That's one point of view.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.600
Charlie,

04:35.800 --> 04:37.700
I notice you haven't said
anything.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.800
Actually, "crazy
she-bat" was mine.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.700
Again, Mom,
we're only telling you this

04:46.800 --> 04:48.900
because we care about you,
right, Charlie?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.200
We care about you.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.600
And, and it's not too late
for you to change

04:52.700 --> 04:54.300
and become the kind
of person that people

04:54.400 --> 04:55.700
would dearly miss.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.800
When you're dead.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.700
You've given me a lot
to think about.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.800
Yes, and, and while you're
thinking, remember the spirit

05:04.900 --> 05:06.000
in which it was intended.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.600
Oh, I won't forget that.

05:11.100 --> 05:12.000
Good, good.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.000
Listen, um, I think I'm gonna
beg off dinner tonight.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.700
Good, good. Aw...

05:20.700 --> 05:22.100
Good-bye, boys.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.600
Bye-bye.
Bye.

05:29.900 --> 05:30.900
Okay.

05:31.000 --> 05:31.800
"Okay"?

05:33.300 --> 05:35.400
What's okay?
What do you see that's okay?

05:35.900 --> 05:37.700
Well, we got out of dinner.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.700
Yes, but at what cost?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.100
Sure, her feelings are hurt
right now,

05:42.200 --> 05:44.100
but that'll pass in time,

05:44.400 --> 05:45.800
and then she'll see this

05:45.900 --> 05:48.200
as an opportunity
to grow and change.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.300
Do you actually believe that?

05:51.400 --> 05:52.900
I have to, Charlie.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.000
I have to.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.300
<i>* Men. *</i>

06:00.800 --> 06:02.900
Yo, mad props
on the sandwich, Dad.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.800
This PB and J is off the hook.

06:06.900 --> 06:07.600
Excuse me?

06:08.200 --> 06:10.300
<i>He's been watching MTV Cribs.</i>

06:12.300 --> 06:13.800
The kid's a sponge.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.600
For shizzle, my dizzle.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.400
Hey, MC Skidmark.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.400
Here's something else
you left in your pants.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.700
Oh, right, I was supposed
to mail this.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.200
What is it?
It's a birthday card

06:28.300 --> 06:30.000
Mom gave me to send to Grandma.

06:30.700 --> 06:33.500
Oh, God! Today's Mom's birthday.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.800
You forgot Mom's birthday?

06:36.400 --> 06:37.300
Did you remember it?

06:37.400 --> 06:40.000
Hey, hey, no one expects me
to remember anything.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.900
Whe's the last time
you talked to her?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.300
I don't know;
probably when we told her

06:44.400 --> 06:46.400
she's a horrible person
and nobody likes her.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.400
Oh, yeah, that was a fun day.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.200
I guess I could save
this for next year.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.400
No, no, no, you'll give it
to her in person.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.000
We'll go out,
we'll buy her present,

06:55.100 --> 06:56.000
and then we'll bring it to her.

06:56.300 --> 06:58.400
Gee, Alan, she hasn't talked
to us in weeks.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.800
Don't you think showing up
with a gift my jeopardize that?

07:01.400 --> 07:02.400
We have to go.
If we don't show up,

07:02.500 --> 07:03.600
we'll never
hear the end of it.

07:03.700 --> 07:04.600
True dat.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.900
You tell 'em, Poop Dog.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.700
Yo, check out
the bling.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.200
Jake, I'm not going
to tell you again.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.600
You're a pasty white kid.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.100
Start acting like one.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.500
Fine.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.300
Oh, this is cool.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.800
It does say "Mom."

07:27.300 --> 07:28.300
Charlie, be serious.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.200
Jake, if you really want
to help, try to find something

07:30.300 --> 07:32.200
that's more appropriate
for your grandma.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.000
Like what?

07:33.500 --> 07:36.500
See if they got a
grizzly bear ripping
apart a salmon.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.200
Hi, there.

07:41.300 --> 07:42.700
May I help you find something?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.400
Oh, yeah, we're, uh,
we're looking

07:44.500 --> 07:45.700
for a birthd gift
for our mother.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.700
Oh, how sweet.
When's her birthday?

07:48.200 --> 07:49.100
Today.

07:49.200 --> 07:49.900
Oh.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.100
He forgot.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.800
Well, um, tell me something
about her.

07:53.900 --> 07:54.700
What does she like?

07:54.800 --> 07:55.700
Hurting people.

07:57.300 --> 07:57.900
Charlie...

07:58.000 --> 07:59.700
It's a little hard
to answer that

07:59.800 --> 08:01.900
because we have a bit of
a strained relationship.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.300
Oh, so you'd like
to find a gift

08:04.400 --> 08:06.400
that would help bring you
closer together.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.000
Oh, no, no.
No, no, no.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.300
This is just your standard
family obligation,

08:12.400 --> 08:13.400
"Here it is,
Happy Birthday

08:13.500 --> 08:15.000
stay off our backs"
kind of thing.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.200
But with a pretty bow.

08:18.700 --> 08:22.000
I see.
And what is your price range?

08:22.200 --> 08:25.400
Uh, enough that she can't
complain, but not so much

08:25.500 --> 08:27.000
that it's worth her
while to return it.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.000
Exactly.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.400
Have you considered

08:30.500 --> 08:32.600
a nice perfume?

08:32.700 --> 08:33.799
Do you know
her scent?

08:33.900 --> 08:35.200
Oh, actually, I don't.

08:35.299 --> 08:36.000
I do.
You do?

08:36.100 --> 08:39.200
Yep. Do you carry
Chanel No. 666?

08:40.799 --> 08:43.600
You know, I think
I'm going to let
the two of you

08:43.700 --> 08:47.600
just browse a bit more
and I'll be back... maybe.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.100
Great news.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.000
It's on sale!

08:54.500 --> 08:55.900
<i>* Men. *</i>

08:56.400 --> 08:58.500
Now, remember, this was not
a last-minute thing.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.700
Our plan all along
was to surprise her.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.700
I know how to lie, Dad.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.400
We're not lying.
We're being considerate.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.700
By lying.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.300
Happy Birthday!

09:11.800 --> 09:13.600
Oh, what a surprise.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.600
That was the plan all along.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.200
I don't knowhat to say.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.300
After the last time we spoke,
I assumed...

09:21.400 --> 09:22.900
Oh, come on, Mom.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.300
No matter what,
you're still our mother.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.300
Right, Charlie?
You're still our mother.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.600
Give her her
present, Jake.

09:29.800 --> 09:30.700
Happy Birthday.

09:30.800 --> 09:31.800
Thank you.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.000
Oh, it's heavy.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.000
It's just a bowl.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.500
I wanted to get you
a bear-eating fish.

09:37.500 --> 09:40.300
But we got her a nice
crystal bowl instead.

09:42.100 --> 09:43.200
So, can we come in?

09:43.300 --> 09:45.300
Actually, I'm having
a little party.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.500
A party?!

09:46.600 --> 09:47.900
And you didn't invite us?

09:48.100 --> 09:51.300
Charles, if someone's not going
to mourn at my funeral,

09:51.400 --> 09:53.600
I certainly don't want them
at my birthday party.

09:54.800 --> 09:55.800
Then who's here?

09:57.700 --> 09:58.600
People who love me.

09:58.700 --> 10:01.200
People who care about me
and accept me for who I am.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.300
Oh, I got to see this.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.400
Please come in.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.400
Oh, hello.

10:11.900 --> 10:12.600
Hi.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.800
Charlie, Alan, Jake,
I'd like you to meet

10:15.900 --> 10:19.100
Roger and Philip
and their son Changpu.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.000
These are my sons
and grandson.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.700
Nice to meet you.
Hello.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.200
Your mom is such
an incredible woman.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.300
She's like the loving
mother I never had.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.200
She's fabulous!

10:29.300 --> 10:30.700
We're one big
happy family.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.700
Son of a bitch,
she got new people.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.200
Who are these guys?

10:42.400 --> 10:44.000
You're surprised
I have friends?

10:44.100 --> 10:45.600
You're surprised
that I'm surprised?

10:46.500 --> 10:48.400
Roger works in
my real estate office,

10:48.400 --> 10:50.800
Philip does my hair
and I introduced them.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.300
They make a lovely
couple, don't they?

10:52.500 --> 10:53.700
Yeah, I guess.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.100
And they adopted...

10:56.100 --> 10:56.900
...Chung King?

10:58.400 --> 11:01.100
Changpu.
Yes-- from China.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.600
Of course I had
to help them a bit,

11:02.700 --> 11:04.900
you know, greasing
the bureaucratic wheels.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.100
You bribed someone?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.500
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.000
I merely slept with
a Commie.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.400
Is this goose liver?

11:12.500 --> 11:14.500
It's quail pate
with endive.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.700
Philip's special recipe.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.800
Oh, you gotta
give it to me.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.000
I'll trade you.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.600
My recipe for
your mother.

11:20.000 --> 11:20.900
Done.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.200
You are so lucky.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.800
My mother is aitch on wheels.

11:25.900 --> 11:27.300
Your mother?
What about my mother?

11:27.400 --> 11:29.100
Fine, your mother's
a bitch, too.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.200
* Thank you. *

11:31.800 --> 11:34.100
So do you have
PlayStation or an Xbox?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.100
I have a cello.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.200
What do you play
on that?

11:38.300 --> 11:41.500
Beethoven, Brahms,
Bach, Shostakovich.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.600
<i>So, no Grand Theft Auto?</i>

11:47.700 --> 11:53.500
* Happy birthday to you *

11:53.600 --> 11:57.800
* Happy birthday
to you *

11:57.900 --> 11:59.800
* Happy birthday *

11:59.900 --> 12:02.700
* Dear Evy *
* Dear Grandma *

12:03.600 --> 12:08.900
* Happy birthday to you. *

12:09.000 --> 12:11.300
My boys, my boys.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.700
Thank you.

12:12.700 --> 12:13.600
Make a wish.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.000
Why? You're already here.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.400
My wish has come true.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.900
Who wishes for two gay guys
and a Chinese kid?

12:26.700 --> 12:30.400
Evy, now we have a very
special present for you.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.700
What do you think,
a bear eating a bear?

12:35.500 --> 12:38.000
Changpu is going to perform
a cello concerto.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.200
He wrote it himself,
in your honor.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.000
How marvelous.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.500
Should I give her
the card now?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.800
Forget about
the card, Jake.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.400
Shh, shh, shh.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.100
Shampoo is gonna play.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Don't feel bad.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.800
I bet he can't
burp the alphabet.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.700
Well, that was one of
the most bizarre evenings

13:13.700 --> 13:14.700
I've ever spent.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.400
It was right up there.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.300
I thought it was fabulous.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.200
You know what's
happened, don't you?

13:23.600 --> 13:24.700
We've been replaced.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.500
Fine with me.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.300
As long as she's got
Siegfried and Roy,

13:28.400 --> 13:29.700
we don't have to
deal with her anymore.

13:30.300 --> 13:31.500
Oh, it's fine with me, too.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.500
I just... I can't believe
she conned these guys

13:33.600 --> 13:35.100
into thinking
she's a good witch.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.200
Well, we know she's not.

13:41.100 --> 13:44.800
Hey, Spongebob GayPants,
take a break.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.000
You don't think
we might've been...

13:49.400 --> 13:51.000
wrong about Mom.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.200
What?!

13:52.300 --> 13:54.300
I'm just saying
that Roger and Philip

13:54.400 --> 13:56.200
obviously see something in her
that we don't.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.300
Who knows her better,
us or them?

13:58.400 --> 13:59.700
Well, us, no question.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
But maybe there's a part of her
we're missing.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.700
Alan, there's a part of her
she's missing.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.100
It's called her soul.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.700
Snap!

14:11.200 --> 14:13.100
<i>* Men. *</i>

14:19.200 --> 14:20.900
Hey, Mom, how are you?

14:21.100 --> 14:23.300
Charlie, what
a pleasant surprise.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.100
Oh, I was just calling to say
happy birthday again

14:26.200 --> 14:27.200
and thanks for last night.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.300
was so nice to meet Philip
and Roger and...

14:31.000 --> 14:32.500
Shanghai.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.500
Changpu.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.600
And thank you for
the lovely crystal bowl.

14:37.800 --> 14:38.700
Oh, good-- you like it.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.700
Like it?
Well, I love it.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.700
I'm admiring it right now.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.600
Great. Great.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.000
Listen, dear,
I've really got to go.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.300
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait, Mom.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.600
I want to clear the air

14:49.700 --> 14:51.500
about that stuff that got said
a couple of weeks ago.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.000
What's that?

14:53.500 --> 14:56.600
Well, I don't have any problems
with you being who you are.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.500
That whole thing about
you needing to change,

14:58.600 --> 15:01.000
well, that's Alan's deal.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.100
Oh, I knew that.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.600
Yeah, yeah, the thing that
I love about our relationship

15:06.600 --> 15:08.400
is that you don't try
to change me

15:08.500 --> 15:09.600
and I don't try to change you.

15:09.700 --> 15:13.200
We accept each other as, you
know, incapable of changing.

15:13.300 --> 15:14.900
That is very sweet.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.800
Okay, here you go:
eggs Benedict.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.300
My own recipe.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.100
Anything else?

15:21.200 --> 15:22.300
No, no, I guess not.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.400
Love you.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.600
You, too.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.500
Bye-bye.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.300
Who was that?

15:28.400 --> 15:29.900
Oh, nobody.

15:30.900 --> 15:33.100
Now, you said there
was something important

15:33.200 --> 15:34.400
you wanted to talk to me about.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.400
Yeah, yeah.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.100
I was just thinking about.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.900
Mm, too much lemon juice
in the hollandaise sauce.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.300
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.800
You should ask Philip
for his recipe.

15:43.800 --> 15:44.700
I will.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
You might also ask him
who cuts his hair.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.500
You don't have to be gay
to look nice.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.400
I'll ask.

15:54.500 --> 15:57.200
Um, anyway, I just wanted
to clear the air

15:57.300 --> 15:58.500
about a few things.

15:58.700 --> 16:00.600
Really? Like what?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.300
Well, you know, that, uh...

16:03.400 --> 16:06.400
that stuff that got said
a couple of weeks ago.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.100
I just want you to know...

16:09.800 --> 16:11.200
it was Charlie'ea.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.300
Oh, I knew that.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.800
Yeah, I only went along
because, you know,

16:17.100 --> 16:18.200
he's the older
brother and...

16:19.300 --> 16:20.700
he might've been drunk.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.400
Well, I'm just glad one of
my sons cares about me.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.900
I do. I love you, Mommy.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Right back at ya.

16:29.700 --> 16:30.500
Now, skidaddle.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.200
Philip and Roger will
be here any minute.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.600
Oh, okay.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.100
Oh, look,
there they are.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.600
Philip, Roger and Changpu.

16:44.300 --> 16:47.300
No pictures of me or Jake?

16:47.900 --> 16:51.800
Sweetheart, I've been asking for
a decent picture for years.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.300
All I've ever gotten
was a school photo of Jake

16:54.400 --> 16:56.400
where he appeared to be
sucking on his shirt.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.400
Oh, yeah, they served spaghetti
on picture day.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.500
Oh, hey, you know what
we should do?

17:03.100 --> 17:06.000
We should get together and
take a nice family portrait.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.099
That sounds lovely.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.099
Great! I'll set it up!
Terrific!

17:09.300 --> 17:11.000
Okay, bye.

17:11.599 --> 17:12.500
Bye-bye.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.900
Um, d I tell you
that I love you, Mommy?

17:17.800 --> 17:20.099
Yes, but I never tire
of hearing it.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.099
Oh, well, in that case, uh,
I love you, Mommy.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.700
I really should have stopped
drinking during pregnancy.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.200
<i>* Men. *</i>

17:48.300 --> 17:49.000
Hello?

17:49.600 --> 17:50.400
Hello.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.100
Hey, Alan?

17:58.200 --> 17:58.900
Yeah?

18:00.300 --> 18:01.400
I couldn't help noticing

18:01.500 --> 18:03.500
there's a photographer
in the living room.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.400
Oh. Yeah, we're, uh...

18:05.500 --> 18:06.500
we're taking
a family picture.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.500
Family picture?

18:10.300 --> 18:11.600
Would it be rude of me
to point out

18:11.700 --> 18:13.400
the obvious flaw in your plan?

18:14.600 --> 18:16.200
I didn't think
you'd be interested.

18:16.300 --> 18:16.900
I'm not.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.600
So, it's just you and Little
Lord Scratch 'n' Sniff?

18:22.400 --> 18:23.700
Hey, if you don't
sniff it,

18:23.800 --> 18:25.200
you don't know
what it is.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.600
Actually, it's a picture
of me, Jake d Mom.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.800
Mom?!

18:35.100 --> 18:36.100
Mom who?

18:37.100 --> 18:39.800
She said she didn't have
any good pictures of us.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.800
Wait a minute.
When did you talk to Mom?

18:43.000 --> 18:43.700
I...

18:44.900 --> 18:46.000
She called me.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.700
You've been sucking up to her
behind my back, haven't you?

18:50.600 --> 18:54.200
Charlie, you have no idea
how insane that sounds.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.300
All I know is after everything
that's happened,

18:58.400 --> 19:01.200
I would never talk to her
without talking to you first.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.000
You wouldn't?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.600
What kind of person
do you take me f?

19:04.700 --> 19:06.000
I'd rather cut off my arm

19:06.100 --> 19:09.400
than pick up the phone and try
to undermine my own brother.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.200
Me, too.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.200
That's why I'm...

19:14.300 --> 19:16.300
taking a bullet here
for the both of us.

19:16.800 --> 19:17.300
Oh.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.800
Well, thanks.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.300
You don't have to thank me...

19:22.300 --> 19:23.400
I'm your brother.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.400
oh, Mommy's here.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.900
Might as well
get this over with.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.100
Wait a sec, hang on.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.500
Let me go change.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.100
You actually want to be
in the picture?

19:36.200 --> 19:37.800
No, no, no,
are you kidding?

19:39.300 --> 19:41.300
It's not fair for you
to have to do it alone.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.600
Oh... well, thanks.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.300
You don't have to thank me.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.600
I'm your brother.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.600
Hi, Mom.
Hello, dear.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.500
Hey, Mom, how are you?
Good to see you.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
Hi, Charlie.

19:55.800 --> 19:59.000
Oh, what a marvelous house.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.200
It's adorable.

20:01.000 --> 20:01.800
Mom?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.800
You said you wanted
a family portrait.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.600
Okay, well,
I'm going back to bed.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.300
Wait, Charlie,
what about the pictu?

20:11.600 --> 20:13.300
Put me down for a wallet size.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.400
???

20:39.700 --> 20:40.300
Like that?

20:40.400 --> 20:42.700
Yeah, but what was all that crap
in the beginning?

20:43.700 --> 20:46.000
It was an introduction
of my own composition.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.300
Well, no offense,
but "Smoke on the Water"

20:48.400 --> 20:50.600
doesn't begin with crap
on the water.

20:52.300 --> 20:53.200
My apologies.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.000
Okay, let's take it
from the top.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.500
One, two, three, four.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.000
The playdate
was a good idea.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.300
Yeah, let's see how
Grandma likes her prodigy

21:11.400 --> 21:13.800
after he sponges up
our sponge.

21:17.600 --> 21:23.600
