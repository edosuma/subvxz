WEBVTT

03:20.080 --> 03:21.127
Yes.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.603
<i>I picked him up
from the airport this afternoon.</i>

03:28.640 --> 03:29.801
I know.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.244
You know what I need?

05:25.560 --> 05:27.562
<i>Are you afraid, my friends?</i>

05:27.680 --> 05:28.681
<i>Of us?</i>

05:29.480 --> 05:30.766
<i>Of Islam?</i>

05:31.760 --> 05:34.415
<i>People are suffering throughout
the Muslim world.</i>

05:34.440 --> 05:37.967
<i>In Palestine, Afghanistan, Baghdad.</i>

05:40.200 --> 05:43.602
<i>But do I believe terrorism</i>

05:44.320 --> 05:47.529
<i>is the justifiable consequence
of this suffering?</i>

05:48.280 --> 05:49.281
<i>No.</i>

05:49.560 --> 05:52.962
<i>Violence against
the innocent is not the way of Allah.</i>

05:54.600 --> 05:56.295
<i>My charities are set up around the world</i>

05:56.320 --> 06:00.695
<i>to stamp out poverty,
as well as promote religious tolerance</i>

06:00.720 --> 06:01.767
<i>and understanding.</i>

06:02.760 --> 06:06.135
<i>We rely on your generous support
to continue our work.</i>

06:06.160 --> 06:07.491
<i>Thank you.</i>

06:35.440 --> 06:36.646
Yes, Maxi.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.009
- Maxi? What have you got?
- Yeah?

06:54.200 --> 06:56.815
Around 11:00 a.m. police received a report

06:56.840 --> 07:00.287
about a suspicious figure
in the central train station.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.495
They were sent this image
taken from a mobile phone.

07:03.520 --> 07:06.815
The quality's not great
but good enough to make a match.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.330
Karpov, Issa.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.445
Chechen, 26.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.885
Classified as an escaped militant jihadist.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.080
Potentially violent.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.535
Approach with caution.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.561
Pull that down.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.175
Security footage has
him returning to the station

07:21.200 --> 07:22.495
five times during the day.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.615
Do we know that guy?

07:23.640 --> 07:25.055
Not yet. Working on it.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.880
Give me the hands.

07:28.640 --> 07:29.720
Some sort of note?

07:30.240 --> 07:31.366
Currency maybe.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.495
That's our last sight of him.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.965
Who else knows he's out there?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.720
The cops haven't made a connection.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.444
And upstairs?

07:38.560 --> 07:39.760
Doesn't look like it.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.206
If not yet they will soon.

07:41.680 --> 07:45.535
Karl, Rasheed, start with the mosques,

07:45.560 --> 07:47.735
homeless shelters, don't break anything.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.570
Niki, try the railway station.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.601
Find out who the hell
that scrawny bastard is.

07:54.560 --> 07:55.721
Great.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.606
Thank you.

07:59.320 --> 08:00.810
Issa Karpov.

08:01.840 --> 08:05.003
A Muslim first name and
a Russian last name.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.366
What does that tell us?

08:07.720 --> 08:09.415
That the boy is confused.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.169
And no patronymic.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.728
Is he the son of nobody?

08:14.240 --> 08:16.811
Issa... Jesus no less.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.602
Maybe he's the son of God
and he's come to save us.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.566
Save me.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.567
Doner plate.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.601
Coffee, black.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.135
Coffee, black.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.366
- One euro.
- Cheers.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.535
<i>Salam.</i>

09:48.560 --> 09:49.891
Thank you.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.601
Hello.

10:54.760 --> 10:58.295
That scrawny bastard,
they call him the Admiral.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.687
He's drinking at Silbersack Bar.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.803
I think you know the place?

11:03.120 --> 11:04.929
Better than I should.

11:05.720 --> 11:09.327
<i>I'm looking at the receipts
from Abdullah's trip to Dubai.</i>

11:10.120 --> 11:13.935
Why make a four hour layover, in Cyprus,

11:13.960 --> 11:17.487
on your way back from Dubai, to Frankfurt?

11:18.040 --> 11:20.008
<i>When you can fly direct?</i>

11:20.280 --> 11:22.248
I don't know, Gunther. Air miles?

11:23.760 --> 11:25.762
With my luck that's probably all it is.

11:26.560 --> 11:29.215
"Seven Friends."

11:29.240 --> 11:30.765
<i>Is that all you have, Günther?</i>

11:30.880 --> 11:32.455
I wish.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.767
It's a shipping company based in Cyprus.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.575
<i>Okay, I'll check it.</i>

11:36.600 --> 11:38.125
All right. Bye-bye.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.640
Admiral.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.600
Admiral.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.764
<i>Herr</i> Dinkelmann.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.484
Missing persons.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.330
Strange boy.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.320
Nervous.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.486
He asked me to find someone for him.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.531
A banker.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.604
And this banker,

12:37.160 --> 12:38.924
did he have a name?

12:51.920 --> 12:53.365
You don't want it?

12:59.360 --> 13:00.486
Brue.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.535
<i>Monsieur</i> Tommy Brue.

13:05.560 --> 13:06.721
Brue.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.135
Word is Mohr is on to something.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.335
His boys are hitting the streets.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.566
Günther?

13:48.400 --> 13:50.135
They found Karpov.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.690
Good.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.520
Keep him walking.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.415
Karpov, the Russian, he's ours.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.044
Am I to understand you've found him?

14:22.960 --> 14:25.691
I remind you that your license
to operate in Hamburg

14:25.800 --> 14:28.495
is contingent on your co-operation
with my office.

14:28.520 --> 14:29.965
I am co-operating, Dieter.

14:30.760 --> 14:34.935
I want this kid to talk to whoever
he was told to talk to,

14:34.960 --> 14:37.255
pray wherever he was told to pray,

14:37.280 --> 14:39.535
sleep wherever he was told to sleep.

14:39.560 --> 14:43.690
I don't want anybody else getting close
to him before we do.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.926
And if this kid lets off a bomb?

14:47.880 --> 14:50.201
It's in your hands, Günther.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.006
Thank Christ it's not in yours

14:52.120 --> 14:55.090
because if it was you'd fuck it up.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.055
Then I want it in writing,
your signature on the letter,

14:58.080 --> 14:59.889
because when the bomb goes off in Hamburg

15:00.000 --> 15:02.095
I want you there to see the blood
on the streets.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.487
Have you ever seen blood on the streets?

15:06.640 --> 15:07.846
Clown.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.735
Melik. We have a guest.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.491
This is Issa, from Chechnya.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.284
That's the kind of face I make.

17:25.680 --> 17:26.974
Weddings.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.641
Every time I attend one,
I see another good woman going to the wall.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.808
Well, what about the man?

17:33.320 --> 17:35.084
The man is the wall.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.611
The apartment belongs to a Leyla Oktay.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.326
Turkish national, German resident.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.486
A widow.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.640
One son, Melik.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.415
Michael.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.330
They have a citizenship
application pending.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.175
Michael.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.560
<i>You've upset Dieter Mohr.</i>

17:55.840 --> 17:56.841
Really?

17:57.280 --> 17:58.575
It probably has something to do

17:58.600 --> 18:01.331
with the terrorists you're allowing to
walk the streets of Hamburg.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.095
<i>We're on a wait and see approach.</i>

18:04.120 --> 18:05.246
And what are we seeing?

18:06.040 --> 18:07.280
Enough to keep waiting.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.562
Don't underestimate Mohr.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.089
He's got a lot of friends here in Berlin.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.735
<i>Why don't you give him the Chechen?</i>

18:14.760 --> 18:17.923
<i>Let him shine while you
stay focused on Abdullah.</i>

18:18.280 --> 18:21.495
I think he's moving the money to
a shipping company.

18:21.520 --> 18:22.521
<i>Are you sure?</i>

18:22.840 --> 18:24.569
Not yet, but close.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.055
I need more time.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.243
<i>I'll do what I can, Günther,
but watch your back.</i>

18:30.600 --> 18:32.682
Word is the Americans
are taking an interest.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.889
Thanks for the warning.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.087
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

18:41.720 --> 18:43.051
Americans.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.730
Günther Bachmann?

18:56.040 --> 18:58.805
Martha Sullivan. US Embassy, Berlin.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.611
I know you by reputation, of course.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.484
That can't be good.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.727
Men with good reputations
usually aren't much use to me.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.604
What about women?

19:11.160 --> 19:14.209
This is my colleague Irna Frey.

19:14.640 --> 19:15.695
- Hello.
- Hello.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.041
She sails and spies.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.165
I don't sail.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.855
Hamburg's a long way from Berlin.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.015
What are you doing here?

19:26.040 --> 19:28.088
Me? I am just an observer.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.575
I have been observed by Americans before.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.728
It usually doesn't end well.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.135
From what I'm hearing, we're not the ones

19:36.160 --> 19:39.289
you need to be worrying about.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.930
Good morning, everyone.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.760
Herr Mohr has compiled a report.

19:46.600 --> 19:50.255
Our investigations
confirm that Issa Karpov

19:50.280 --> 19:54.763
is a member of a militant Salafi group
of Chechen jihadists.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.255
Karpov was arrested soon after the capture

19:58.280 --> 20:00.601
of the group's leader earlier this year.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.406
Where did this information come from?

20:04.120 --> 20:07.681
We have excellent resources
inside the Russian state security system.

20:08.760 --> 20:12.321
After 24 hours of questioning,
Karpov confessed

20:12.440 --> 20:16.095
to taking part in attacks on gas pipelines,

20:16.120 --> 20:19.203
transport, infrastructure, police stations.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.535
After 24 hours of Russian questioning

20:21.560 --> 20:24.055
any one of us would admit to anything.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.445
Are you contesting this report?

20:25.560 --> 20:26.891
No. Yes.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.166
Maybe.

20:29.440 --> 20:32.364
We've not yet had the
benefit of reading it.

20:32.800 --> 20:36.615
The report concludes that
the terrorist Karpov has come to Hamburg

20:36.640 --> 20:42.329
seeking to make contact
with Islamist cells operating in the city.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.975
They hide among us.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.570
- Really?
- Yes.

20:45.680 --> 20:46.975
Karpov is a wanted man.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.415
If you have knowledge of his whereabouts,

20:49.440 --> 20:53.615
you are obliged to follow
due process under the constitution.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.165
You mean arresting him?

20:56.800 --> 21:01.203
Issa Karpov is indeed seeking
to make contact in Hamburg,

21:02.320 --> 21:03.375
with a banker.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.084
We've had no briefing on this.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.401
Well, if you were doing your job,
you wouldn't need one.

21:07.680 --> 21:08.695
We're not policemen.

21:08.720 --> 21:11.775
We're spies.
Issa Karpov may be of value to us.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.167
All I'm asking for is more time.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.935
Our unit was set up to develop
intelligence resources

21:17.960 --> 21:20.440
inside Germany's Islamic community.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.284
That's why we're here.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.535
And I thought you were here
because you fucked up in Beirut

21:27.560 --> 21:29.528
and your friend Michael
Axelrod had no idea...

21:29.640 --> 21:32.255
This banker, do we know
what Karpov wants from him?

21:32.280 --> 21:34.855
Not yet and if we move against him now,

21:34.880 --> 21:36.564
the chances are we never will.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.175
I think he knows what he's doing, Otto.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.202
Maybe you should let him get on with it.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.044
You have 72 hours to bring

21:50.160 --> 21:51.575
this matter to a resolution,

21:51.600 --> 21:55.730
if not, we will,
with or without your co-operation.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.050
- Okay?
- Okay.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.486
Where should we go?

22:08.600 --> 22:10.280
Meet at the place on the corner?

22:11.080 --> 22:12.206
Okay.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.895
I'll catch up with you later.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.922
Okay, we'll see you there.

22:22.760 --> 22:23.921
Melik?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.364
Did we have an appointment?

22:39.240 --> 22:40.575
Annabel Richter, Mama.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.215
Hello, Leyla. How are you?

22:43.240 --> 22:45.335
Welcome to our house, <i>Frau</i> Annabel.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.015
Nice to see you again.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.246
Come in. Come in please.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.566
Thank you.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.762
The boy is good,
<i>Frau</i> Annabel. Do you understand?

22:57.360 --> 22:58.895
If he has done something wrong,

22:58.920 --> 23:00.843
it's because he had no...

23:09.960 --> 23:11.255
Hello, Issa.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.935
My name is Annabel Richter.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.086
I am a lawyer.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.808
I work with an organization
called Sanctuary North.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.325
- Please?
- Okay.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.048
Are you seeking asylum in Germany?

23:32.480 --> 23:34.005
I make coffee.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.962
There has to be a reason.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.455
Either you cannot return
to your country of origin

23:43.480 --> 23:44.815
because your life would be in danger

23:44.840 --> 23:46.171
or you have been tortured.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.601
Yes.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.055
Yes, what?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.889
I have been tortured.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.001
Forgive me, but this is my job.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.922
I want to believe you,
but people make this claim all the time.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.371
I have to...

24:18.760 --> 24:20.375
Who did this to you?

24:20.400 --> 24:21.481
<i>Roosskie.</i>

24:23.520 --> 24:25.921
I cannot help you unless
you are honest with me.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.055
It's only a matter of time before the
German authorities will find you.

24:29.080 --> 24:32.129
It's better for your case
if you go to them first.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.840
- We can make a formal...
- I will never, never go back to Russia.

24:37.760 --> 24:38.966
Please?

24:40.080 --> 24:42.128
You will contact this man.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.564
He will help me.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.090
Mr. Thomas Brue.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.015
Colonel Grigori Borisovich Karpov,

25:19.040 --> 25:21.247
stationed in Chechnya, 1986.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.849
He was involved with organized crime.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.688
Big time. Drugs for arms.
White slave traffic.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.164
You name it he was in to it.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.125
Karpov died two years ago.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.764
- And?
- He had a son.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.361
Ivan.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.489
Born, 1986 in Chechnya.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.770
Mother unknown.

25:43.720 --> 25:44.960
Good.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.450
<i>Fraulein</i> Richter?

25:53.040 --> 25:54.724
Please follow me.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.240
Please.

26:07.480 --> 26:11.246
What exactly is Sanctuary North?

26:11.480 --> 26:12.481
I'm a lawyer.

26:12.840 --> 26:16.481
Our clients are people
who have left their place of birth.

26:16.840 --> 26:19.127
They are effectively stateless.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.845
They are often traumatized.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.361
What is it you want, Miss Richter?

26:26.520 --> 26:27.567
A donation?

26:31.720 --> 26:33.051
I'm sorry.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.363
That was insensitive.

26:36.920 --> 26:39.241
I'm here on behalf of a client.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.962
His name is Issa Karpov.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.735
Is the name known to you?

26:44.760 --> 26:46.055
Karpov?

26:46.080 --> 26:47.127
No.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.611
He is in possession of a letter
written by your father to his.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.091
It makes reference to a Mr. Lipizzaner,

26:56.040 --> 26:59.175
as in the Spanish horses which are
born black but gradually turn white.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.201
Yes.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.365
This is a process I'm guessing
your bank is familiar with?

27:07.160 --> 27:09.367
The letter contains a number.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.055
Does it fit?

27:18.080 --> 27:19.535
Does it fit what?

27:19.560 --> 27:22.415
Is the number an account reference
in use at this bank?

27:22.440 --> 27:25.175
I'm afraid my bank

27:25.200 --> 27:28.602
doesn't broadcast the manner
in which it does its business.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.728
I'm sure that suits your clients very well.

27:32.560 --> 27:37.815
But if this number does pertain
to an account held at this bank,

27:37.840 --> 27:41.162
it would have been established
quite some time ago.

27:42.280 --> 27:46.410
I will need to check our records.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.895
Once I have done so I will call you.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.001
When?

27:50.160 --> 27:54.165
My client's situation in Hamburg
is extremely sensitive Mr. Brue.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.726
I'm sure.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.285
He trusts you.

27:59.320 --> 28:03.450
As, judging by the contents of
the letter, his father trusted yours.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.640
Big boy.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.281
Six...

28:54.560 --> 28:55.641
3448.

29:32.120 --> 29:35.283
"Grigori Borisovich Karpov."

30:08.040 --> 30:09.375
Sorry.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.244
That's all right. I've given up.

30:13.120 --> 30:15.248
Yeah? Good luck with that.

30:25.080 --> 30:26.127
Yes?

30:28.520 --> 30:29.726
Okay.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.095
The Atlantic.

30:32.120 --> 30:33.724
I'll be there.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.728
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.805
Have something to drink?

30:48.920 --> 30:50.655
Glass of wine?

30:50.680 --> 30:52.895
Still water please.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.763
Still water. Of course.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.328
You frequent the Atlantic?

31:01.760 --> 31:03.410
Not your scene?

31:05.600 --> 31:09.605
You said your client's situation
was sensitive, hence the hurry.

31:11.720 --> 31:15.815
I can confirm that the reference number
you supplied

31:15.840 --> 31:19.287
does pertain to an account
held at Brue Freres Bank.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.487
Then he intends to make a claim.

31:23.480 --> 31:26.211
Then tell him to bring a large suitcase.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.209
Of course he will need
to establish his identity.

31:31.920 --> 31:35.481
My client entered the country
in difficult circumstances.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.135
He has the letter.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.815
- I will need to see it.
- Of course.

31:38.840 --> 31:42.811
And in addition, he will need to
provide a certain instrument.

31:42.920 --> 31:43.975
Which is?

31:44.000 --> 31:47.055
I'm afraid I can't say,

31:47.080 --> 31:49.455
but if your client is legitimate

31:49.480 --> 31:51.767
he will know what I am talking about.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.481
And if he has this instrument?

31:55.520 --> 31:58.046
I see no difficulty in proceeding.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.529
She's coming out.

32:24.520 --> 32:25.775
Attractive.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.211
Not my type.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.535
What is your type, Günther?

32:30.560 --> 32:32.642
You are, Irna. You know that.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.083
Johannes-Brahms-Platz.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.565
Hello, Tommy.

33:20.640 --> 33:21.687
And you are?

33:22.400 --> 33:24.209
My name is Bachmann.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.728
I head an anti-terror unit

33:28.680 --> 33:32.924
not many people know about
and even less like.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.530
Let's walk.

34:14.360 --> 34:17.775
Hamburg is one of
the great ports of the world, Tommy.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.255
For centuries it opened its arms

34:20.280 --> 34:23.489
to every foreigner
who washed up on its shores.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.135
Now, since 9/11,

34:27.159 --> 34:29.375
in the eyes of every dark-skinned man

34:29.400 --> 34:31.975
we see someone who wants to kill us.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.728
Problem is some of them do,

34:34.360 --> 34:38.251
but the question is whether
Issa Karpov is one of them.

34:40.440 --> 34:41.965
The lawyer.

34:43.440 --> 34:44.735
Lawyer?

34:44.760 --> 34:46.330
Annabel Richter.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.851
The one you met at the hotel.
The one you'd like to fuck.

34:50.719 --> 34:52.290
What? Not true?

34:52.840 --> 34:55.375
You're too old for her, Tommy. We both are.

34:55.400 --> 34:58.255
See her, love her, but
you'll never get her,

34:58.280 --> 35:00.044
not even with all that black money

35:00.160 --> 35:02.415
you've got tucked away in your bank vaults.

35:02.440 --> 35:06.175
As far as I am aware,
Miss Richter represents

35:06.200 --> 35:11.081
a client with a legitimate
financial interest with my bank.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.375
Your bank does business
with the Russians, right?

35:14.400 --> 35:17.015
It did. In my father's time.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.041
Mafia?

35:18.640 --> 35:20.244
Military mainly.

35:22.920 --> 35:26.015
What's to stop me

35:26.040 --> 35:29.089
from just walking away from this?

35:30.200 --> 35:32.535
Whatever this is.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.848
How about we start with
a full audit of your books?

35:37.520 --> 35:41.730
But your father wasn't
just a banker, Tommy.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.655
He was a laundryman.

35:43.680 --> 35:44.695
You're threatening me?

35:44.720 --> 35:45.926
Just sympathizing.

35:47.080 --> 35:49.082
You've been left to clean up the mess.

36:07.080 --> 36:09.321
We have a job to do, Tommy.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.495
You're going to help me do it.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.655
Do what exactly?

36:14.680 --> 36:17.365
Save Annabel Richter, for a start.

36:17.640 --> 36:18.971
From what?

36:20.960 --> 36:22.769
From all of it.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.695
I wasn't expecting you.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.015
No?

36:59.040 --> 37:00.963
Who were you expecting?

37:02.480 --> 37:03.686
Bad day?

37:04.520 --> 37:06.170
A few surprises.

37:12.680 --> 37:14.808
Enjoy your scotch, Tommy.

37:16.280 --> 37:19.204
And try not to fall over
on your way to bed.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.087
Issa, it is somebody for you.

38:15.280 --> 38:17.095
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.175
Thank you for coming.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.201
Of course.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.121
Issa.

38:23.360 --> 38:24.600
This is Mr. Brue.

38:25.640 --> 38:26.880
Morning.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.920
Perhaps you could show him the letter.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.209
"My dear Karpov,"

38:40.240 --> 38:42.615
"as discussed, please accept this letter"

38:42.640 --> 38:45.815
"as assurance from one friend to another,"

38:45.840 --> 38:48.935
"that in the unfortunate
circumstance of your death"

38:48.960 --> 38:52.655
"I should be pleased
to acquaint your own dear son,"

38:52.680 --> 38:54.489
"Ivan Grigorevich Karpov,"

38:54.600 --> 38:57.649
"with our friend Mr. Lipizzaner."

38:58.440 --> 39:00.015
"He need only present this letter,"

39:00.040 --> 39:02.055
"together with the necessary instrument"

39:02.080 --> 39:04.924
<i>"currently in your
possession for me to act."</i>

39:07.280 --> 39:09.015
<i>"In case of my own death,"</i>

39:09.040 --> 39:13.204
<i>"my son Thomas will fulfill
my promise to you."</i>

39:14.320 --> 39:18.135
Forgive me.
It's correct signature of your father?

39:18.160 --> 39:19.321
It is.

39:20.280 --> 39:23.841
Should I address you then as Issa or Ivan?

39:24.280 --> 39:25.575
Issa.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.251
It's my Muslim name and I like.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.281
But not the one your father gave you?

39:31.920 --> 39:33.809
My mother was Chechen.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.335
I wish, sir, with your help,

39:36.360 --> 39:39.011
to make an honorable life in Hamburg.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.055
Very good,

39:41.080 --> 39:45.324
but first, you understand
there are certain questions of fact.

39:46.720 --> 39:50.122
I bring your attention
to the matter of the instrument.

39:56.080 --> 40:01.007
May I ask how you came
to be in possession of this?

40:01.920 --> 40:03.888
It was given to me by my father's lawyer.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.490
So it seems I am being asked

40:09.000 --> 40:12.575
to fulfill one father's promise to another.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.967
It's true. Karpov was my father.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.764
You weren't close?

40:18.560 --> 40:20.562
My father was a murderer.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.924
He has Chechen blood on his hands.

40:23.160 --> 40:26.130
And yet you seem
willing enough to take his money?

40:33.400 --> 40:36.210
I understand you came here from Turkey,

40:37.160 --> 40:40.050
by an informal route, shall we say?

40:41.080 --> 40:44.607
May I ask, what you were doing in Turkey?

40:45.720 --> 40:47.370
I was in prison.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.050
And before that?

40:52.760 --> 40:54.524
I was in prison in Russia.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.735
- Why?
- You don't need to answer that, Issa.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.046
Why not?

41:00.160 --> 41:01.400
Because it is immaterial.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.522
To what, <i>Fraulein</i> Richter?

41:04.160 --> 41:05.175
Your client...

41:05.200 --> 41:06.884
He's your client, too, Mr. Brue.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.855
Your client lays claim

41:09.880 --> 41:11.535
to his father's account,

41:11.560 --> 41:13.935
yet he has no passport,

41:13.960 --> 41:15.450
cannot prove his identity.

41:15.720 --> 41:18.564
He has the key and the letter,
what more do you want?

41:43.000 --> 41:46.163
We couldn't hear everything so well, Tommy.

41:46.960 --> 41:50.043
So exactly how much are we talking about?

41:50.520 --> 41:52.575
I can't tell you.

41:52.600 --> 41:53.681
Not exactly.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.603
A ballpark figure?

41:58.280 --> 42:01.375
10,000, 100,000, 500,000?

42:01.400 --> 42:03.448
We're talking

42:04.760 --> 42:07.127
upwards of 10 million euro.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.446
At least.

42:19.720 --> 42:20.815
- Coffee.
- Yes, sir.

42:20.840 --> 42:22.126
- Black.
- Right away.

42:24.080 --> 42:25.855
I wasn't sure you'd come.

42:25.880 --> 42:27.644
I want to make one thing clear.

42:28.920 --> 42:30.126
I don't owe you anything.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.768
What happened in Beirut?

42:35.080 --> 42:37.082
You know what happened in Beirut.

42:37.200 --> 42:39.089
My networks were blown.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.328
So Hamburg is a punishment?

42:43.480 --> 42:46.165
Depends on whether you like Hamburg.

42:48.320 --> 42:50.721
Unless that's what you
want people to think?

42:51.640 --> 42:53.335
Take some of the heat off you so you can

42:53.360 --> 42:54.725
get on with the real game.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.001
Which is?

42:56.280 --> 42:58.044
Dr. Faisal Abdullah.

42:58.069 --> 43:00.069
SharePirate.Com Subs

43:02.400 --> 43:06.325
Come on, Günther, we probably
know as much about him as you do.

43:09.200 --> 43:11.202
What do you know, Martha?

43:14.560 --> 43:17.455
We know you've been
watching him for months,

43:17.480 --> 43:20.211
and we know you're under pressure
to get results.

43:21.680 --> 43:23.335
And we know that the man moves money

43:23.360 --> 43:24.655
through a network of Muslim charities

43:24.680 --> 43:27.684
and every time he does,
some of it goes missing.

43:32.400 --> 43:34.255
Dr. Faisal Abdullah is everything

43:34.280 --> 43:35.855
we want him to be and a little bit more.

43:35.880 --> 43:39.089
He's tolerant, enlightened,
engaged with the West.

43:41.040 --> 43:44.408
But every good man
has a little bit of bad, doesn't he?

43:48.560 --> 43:51.847
And in Abdullah's
case, that little bit

43:53.800 --> 43:54.926
just might kill you.

43:55.720 --> 44:00.015
You know all that, how come he's still
walking the streets of Hamburg

44:00.040 --> 44:02.646
and not rotting in some cell in Guantanamo?

44:04.320 --> 44:06.655
Because we think, we don't know.

44:06.680 --> 44:09.251
The money leaves
and we don't know where it goes.

44:10.280 --> 44:13.807
Anyways, on German soil
he's got the protection of German law.

44:13.920 --> 44:16.375
That hasn't stopped you before.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.084
We don't do that anymore.

44:18.280 --> 44:19.930
You want us to do it, then.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.680
I'm more interested in knowing why
you haven't done it already?

44:24.880 --> 44:27.042
Please work with us on this one, Günther.

44:28.760 --> 44:30.410
I don't trust you.

44:33.160 --> 44:34.924
Old habits die hard.

44:35.720 --> 44:37.927
That's what I'm worried about.

44:39.720 --> 44:41.768
I was talking about yours.

44:44.760 --> 44:45.761
Have a nice day.

44:45.920 --> 44:46.921
You too.

45:06.360 --> 45:07.964
I got your text.

45:13.880 --> 45:14.927
I...

45:15.840 --> 45:17.808
I can't do this anymore.

45:20.120 --> 45:22.771
Someone's going to find out. I can feel it.

45:27.400 --> 45:28.925
I'm frightened.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.855
They are looking at me.

45:34.880 --> 45:36.325
All of them.

45:37.320 --> 45:39.129
I'm done. It's over.

45:40.400 --> 45:43.006
I am not your spy. I am a student.

45:43.840 --> 45:45.735
You cannot make me do this.

45:45.760 --> 45:48.286
I never made you do anything, Jamal.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.729
And I never will.

45:54.480 --> 45:55.970
You know that.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.684
When we first met,

46:01.760 --> 46:03.922
you remember what we talked about?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.684
You remember that?

46:09.360 --> 46:11.601
Family, the future.

46:13.600 --> 46:16.683
Most of us don't get to
choose, but you did.

46:18.040 --> 46:20.202
You made the right choice.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.285
It's not easy.

46:26.960 --> 46:29.008
But there's no going back,

46:30.280 --> 46:31.850
for any of us.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.768
We can't undo what's done.

46:47.840 --> 46:49.251
Look at me.

46:50.040 --> 46:51.655
Look at me.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.011
Come here.

46:58.560 --> 47:01.723
You're my ears, Jamal, and my eyes.
I need you.

47:03.720 --> 47:05.643
You're important to me.

47:11.320 --> 47:12.401
Good.

48:46.280 --> 48:47.805
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Tom my?

48:49.000 --> 48:50.081
<i>Yes.</i>

48:50.680 --> 48:53.570
You need to give Issa Karpov what he wants.

49:13.720 --> 49:15.324
Miss Richter?

49:20.040 --> 49:21.655
Can we talk?

49:21.680 --> 49:24.331
Perhaps we could go for a tea?

49:25.680 --> 49:27.284
What do you want?

49:28.720 --> 49:31.200
I've reconsidered your client's position.

49:31.320 --> 49:34.244
My bank is prepared to honor his claim.

49:36.320 --> 49:38.288
Why have you changed your mind?

49:40.360 --> 49:42.408
Perhaps you convinced me.

49:44.600 --> 49:46.090
I thought you'd be pleased.

49:51.560 --> 49:52.686
Okay.

49:54.080 --> 49:55.127
I'll be in touch.

49:57.720 --> 49:58.926
Annabel?

50:02.280 --> 50:04.089
We should take care.

50:05.200 --> 50:06.326
All of us.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.731
<i>It is our religious obligation to give.</i>

50:39.120 --> 50:41.055
<i>This is the holy practice of Zakat,</i>

50:41.080 --> 50:42.809
<i>one of the five pillars of Islam.</i>

50:44.640 --> 50:47.935
<i>Through our adherence
to this practice of charity,</i>

50:47.960 --> 50:49.975
<i>we are drawn nearer to God.</i>

50:50.000 --> 50:51.729
Günther, the banker called. He did it.

50:52.480 --> 50:53.561
Good.

50:56.600 --> 50:57.965
Issa! Issa!

50:58.520 --> 50:59.935
Wake up.

51:03.400 --> 51:04.970
Where will you take him?

51:05.640 --> 51:07.847
It's better if you don't know.

51:08.680 --> 51:09.841
We have to go.

51:10.240 --> 51:13.483
It's not safe to stay here.
For you or for them.

51:14.640 --> 51:15.846
There are clothes in here.

51:17.880 --> 51:20.008
There's also some scissors and a razor.

51:23.240 --> 51:24.844
Issa, they know what you look like.

51:27.320 --> 51:28.526
Come on, Issa.

52:39.440 --> 52:40.487
They're moving.

52:46.920 --> 52:48.684
Where are we going?

52:49.880 --> 52:53.655
My brother Florien has an apartment
that's being renovated.

52:53.680 --> 52:56.445
He's arranged for them
to stop work for a week.

54:11.120 --> 54:13.122
Where's the next station?

54:14.640 --> 54:15.721
Okay.

54:26.080 --> 54:27.684
We get out at the next stop.

54:28.480 --> 54:31.006
We have to find another taxi, okay?

54:59.400 --> 55:00.535
Hey.

55:00.560 --> 55:02.369
You're blocking the street!

55:05.880 --> 55:07.006
Hey.

55:43.920 --> 55:44.921
Fuck!

56:05.240 --> 56:06.401
Hello?

56:09.120 --> 56:10.121
Hello?

56:13.720 --> 56:15.415
Against the wall!

56:15.440 --> 56:16.851
Check the other rooms!

56:16.960 --> 56:18.015
Stop!

56:18.040 --> 56:19.201
Bedroom clear.

56:38.120 --> 56:39.201
We're nearly there.

57:24.960 --> 57:26.644
I wish to talk to Mr. Brue.

57:27.440 --> 57:29.602
I spoke with him earlier tonight.

57:31.800 --> 57:34.095
Issa, he says the bank
will honor your claim.

57:34.120 --> 57:36.088
I do not want the money.

57:37.760 --> 57:38.886
What?

57:39.360 --> 57:42.204
Father's money is bad money.

57:42.880 --> 57:44.564
But without it you have nothing.

57:45.560 --> 57:46.641
I have God.

57:54.680 --> 57:56.569
I brought you some food.

58:05.120 --> 58:08.090
There's a sleeping bag
and some more clothes.

58:10.160 --> 58:12.520
I'll be back first thing in the morning.

58:16.720 --> 58:18.404
It is not a prison.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.720
This was the best you could do?

58:36.760 --> 58:38.205
I am a cave dweller.

58:39.200 --> 58:41.567
I'll leave the rooms with a view to you.

58:43.800 --> 58:45.928
You let Mohr off the leash?

58:47.920 --> 58:51.402
He doesn't need me
to give him a reason to piss you off.

58:56.960 --> 58:59.281
You've lost Karpov, haven't you?

59:00.800 --> 59:03.167
I need the lawyer to move freely.

59:07.280 --> 59:09.175
I don't have that kind
of influence, Günther.

59:09.200 --> 59:12.855
We both know you have
all the influence you choose to have.

59:12.880 --> 59:16.095
Look, if you want me to help you on
your way, you've got to tell me.

59:16.120 --> 59:17.770
Tell me which way you're heading.

59:21.360 --> 59:25.160
Last month a cargo ship left Cyprus.

59:26.640 --> 59:30.850
It was carrying 1,000 tons
of donated grain bound for Djibouti.

59:31.800 --> 59:35.850
It stopped to re-fuel
on the south coast of Yemen.

59:37.480 --> 59:41.201
When it reached its destination
there were 900 tons left.

59:42.160 --> 59:44.447
At the same time 100 tons of grain

59:45.040 --> 59:48.362
mysteriously hit
the open market in the Yemen.

59:49.160 --> 59:53.484
The money from its sale was
used to buy rocket launchers

59:53.680 --> 59:55.444
for Islamist militants.

59:56.160 --> 01:00:00.324
I think the shipping company
is an al-Qaeda front.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.051
I think that's where the missing funds

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.003
from Abdullah's charities are going.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.163
You think, or you know?

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.175
Come on, Günther. Share.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.328
Abdullah's not the bad guy.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.488
He's our way to the bad guy.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:22.608
A man supplies money
that buys weapons that kills Americans

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.095
and you're telling me he's a pal?

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.295
So maybe he's not waving
the flag of freedom and democracy

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.855
as enthusiastically as you'd like.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.006
Okay.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.855
- But he sees his people...
- Spare the lecture.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.655
He sees his people
being fucked over from here to eternity.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:35.775
I've heard that before, so...

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:40.442
Maybe a little bit of him
wants to return the favor,

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.248
but it's that little bit
that makes him so valuable.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.601
Don't you see?

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.775
Okay. I understand.
But that's not what my people would say.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.883
What would your people say?
Take him out? Kill him?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.615
And then what have you got?

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.042
A great big fucking hole,
and who's going to fill it?

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.447
Nobody knows. You least of all.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.055
So we all start looking again,

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.844
and tap-tapping around in the dark.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.935
You want to own Abdullah,
is that what you want?

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.964
A man with your reputation
and your resources.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.287
How are you going to do that?

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.571
Karpov has access to money.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.449
That may be of interest to Abdullah.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.615
And the lawyer?

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.215
He trusts her.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.371
It's okay.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.965
It's okay?

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.006
Dance.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:00.415
- Trying to impress me, Günther?
- No.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.375
Listen, I'll put Mohr back on the leash,

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.129
but now you owe me.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.445
Hey, Annabel.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.847
Good to see you. How's Ursula?

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.735
Um... No, no.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.086
Let go. Let go of me!

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.447
Yes?

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.015
Okay?

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.724
- Yeah. Good.
- Yeah.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.326
Rasheed?

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.735
You can't do this. I'm a lawyer.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:23.761
This is criminal.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.405
Sit the fuck down.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.646
Lawyer?

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.801
You're a fucking social
worker for terrorists.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.728
Cigarette?

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.441
That's right, you've given up.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.845
Is that it?

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.643
Is that all the fight
you're going to give me?

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.291
Pacifist.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.604
We know about you.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.050
Left-wing lawyer.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.930
Wealthy family.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.970
Father's a judge.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.485
Everything you do says "fuck you" to him.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.168
Is that the best you can do?

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.925
Can I go now?

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:27.720
Go where?

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.560
Go where?

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.962
Back to your self-righteous friends
at Sanctuary North?

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.762
But no one's going
to saw off their heads, are they?

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.175
Nobody's going to blow up their kids

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.215
because you're on a beach in Bali

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.369
or riding a train to school
in Madrid or London.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.935
How fucking dare you?

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.295
How fucking dare me?

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.722
Tell me I've broken every rule in the book?

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.404
That I've trampled
on the essence of the constitution?

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.042
You want to spout that crap?

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.561
Yes?

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.448
Do you know where you are?

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.691
No, you don't.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.121
This is the real world, Annabel.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:40.924
We are fighting against the radical
off cuts of a nation called Islam.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.445
You've crossed the line.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.562
You're on their side now.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.775
Hello.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.490
I don't care what you do to me.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:47.164
But you're not the one
we're talking about, are you, dear?

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.488
Issa must be worried sick.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.848
Wherever you've hidden him,

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.163
he's probably wondering
if you're ever coming back.

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.206
I hope he doesn't do anything foolish.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.290
Come, sit with me.

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.000
Come on.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:21.523
<i>There are people out there
who want to arrest him.</i>

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.968
<i>You know that of course.</i>

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:27.768
<i>We're concerned that they
will find him before we do.</i>

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.444
There is a difference between them and us.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.569
They want to hurt him.

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:39.169
We want to help him.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.495
You see, Annabel, we're not your enemy.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.283
We're your solution.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.041
Good.

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:54.681
You know what my guys told me?

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.726
When they pulled you off the street?

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.648
You didn't put up a fight.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.245
Not really.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.535
You struggled a bit.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.324
Screamed a little, but

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.203
you let them take you.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:19.369
It's almost as if you wanted it to happen.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.775
You needed someone to
take it out of your hands

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.724
because you are out of your depth, Annabel.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.690
You know you can't save him,

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.364
not on your own.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.322
Your choice is between us

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.125
and nobody.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.323
The clock is ticking.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.644
You know they'll find
him, and when they do,

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.495
he'll be on the first plane back to Russia,

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.727
unless the Americans want him

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:10.603
and then we won't know
where he is and nor will he.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.168
He doesn't want the money.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.888
He just doesn't want it.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.730
Half radical, half

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.575
rich kid.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.206
Half Russian, half Chechen.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.046
Loves his mother, hates his father.

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:37.645
You and I both know
Issa Karpov has no idea what he wants.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.735
There is something else

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.047
you and I both know, don't we?

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.041
We both know he's innocent.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.569
So what do you want?

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.969
I want to help him.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.126
Issa?

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.295
Issa, I'm sorry.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.810
I had a dream.

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.361
They took you. They tortured you.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.011
And what happened?

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.084
Did I tell them where you were?

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.721
No.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.135
You are stronger than I was.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.049
You tell them nothing.

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.521
Go and put on something warm.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.722
I want to show you something outside.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.481
Okay.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.281
Right.

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.371
Look at him.

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.565
He's safe.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.047
There's a bed for you here.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.415
It's better that you don't go home.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.568
Herr Mohr and his boys
are still out looking for you.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.247
Are you trying to get me drunk?

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.846
Yes.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.884
How's Karpov?

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.965
Getting there.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.525
And the lawyer?

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:12.325
I already got you all the time I can get.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.205
Beirut was our mistake.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.724
One of our agents

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:26.327
blew your network and I know you shared.
We messed up.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.006
Just thought you needed to know that.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.807
We make that kind of mistake.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.691
I can understand why you don't trust us.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.084
Your agents and contacts were compromised.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:49.735
Men who trusted you died,

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:52.081
and that stays with you always.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.124
And all that damage

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.244
we leave behind.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.810
All those lives,

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.009
all those empty rooms,

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.401
what would they have been for?

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.726
You ever ask yourself that question?

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.291
Why we do what we do?

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.775
Sometimes.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.895
But I always come back to the same answer.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.445
And what is it?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.207
Make the world a safer place.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.961
Isn't that enough?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.047
Move your queen.

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.135
Just because you're Russian,

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:18.482
doesn't mean you're a better
chess player than me.

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.531
I'm Chechen.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.967
Okay, so you're good at chess.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.845
Tell me something else about yourself.

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.681
You said your mother is Chechen?

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.841
She's dead.

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.125
I'm sorry.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.169
My father raped her.

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.335
She died when I was born.

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.325
She was 15.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.611
It was my mother's.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.130
It's beautiful.

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.725
<i>You must go.</i>

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.685
You can push him a bit more.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.202
Try to get him emotional.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.844
If it happens naturally, lose your temper.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.655
But he doesn't want the money.

01:21:58.680 --> 01:21:59.841
I know.

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.524
But he wants you.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.680
Günther?

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.644
You should take care.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.967
Maybe we're pushing too hard.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.528
Don't go soft on me, Irna.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.883
There's no room for that on this one.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.688
Tell me one where there was.

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.246
Morning.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.767
Seventy people died in a market
in Baghdad yesterday.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.760
<i>Insha Allah.</i>

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.565
God's will?

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.735
<i>Or just a man who
was arrogant enough to kill in his name?</i>

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:53.886
She's good.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.440
Leyla and Melik have been arrested.

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.455
They may be deported,

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.295
because they were kind to you,

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:05.322
because they invited you in to their home.

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.215
<i>Explain it to me, Issa!</i>

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.651
<i>God's will?</i>

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.248
<i>Explain to me why that man who killed</i>

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.203
<i>those women and children in Baghdad</i>

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.209
<i>is any different from your own father?</i>

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.015
<i>I came to Hamburg to make a new life.</i>

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:22.775
<i>No. You came to Hamburg
to find Mr. Tommy Brue.</i>

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.615
<i>You came to claim your father's money.</i>

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.530
<i>I told you, I do not want his money.</i>

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.165
Forgive me.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:24:59.921
Maybe

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:06.447
there's a way to leave
your past behind, Issa.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:13.015
<i>- Take your father's money...</i>
- Take your father's money,

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:16.726
- and turn it into something good.
<i>- ...and turn it into something good.</i>

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.769
Your goat is tethered.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:26.328
It's just an ordinary pen.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.201
Looks like a pen,
writes like a pen and listens like a pen.

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.167
Take it apart, it's still a pen.

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.890
Are you clear?

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.965
Are you clear?

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.615
You are acting on behalf
of a wealthy Muslim client.

01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:40.695
We've been over this.

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.095
You are acting on behalf
of a wealthy Muslim...

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.295
Several times.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.295
Who has come in to
a considerable inheritance

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.575
and the source of the
money is questionable.

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.855
He seeks to distribute these funds

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.055
in a spiritually correct manner.

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.764
For Christ's sake!

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.641
I'm not doing this for you.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:58.484
Whatever it takes, Tommy.

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:57.761
Hello.

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.166
Put your arms up.

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:07.087
Bag?

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:21.881
Hi.

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:25.241
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.415
- Mr. Brue?
- Yes.

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:27.535
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.615
I'm Jamal.

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:30.015
My father is expecting you.

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.815
- Can you take off your shoes?
- Of course.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.569
I'll take care of the coat.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.375
Mr. Brue.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.164
- Mr. Brue.
- An honor.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.215
You have met my son Jamal?

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:54.164
Yes, and, another at the door, I believe.

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.731
Please sit.

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.166
Please.

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.095
As explained to you,

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:12.335
my client's situation
in Germany is delicate.

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.840
These are the details of his offer.

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.495
As you can see, there are specific requests

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.815
for some money to be sent to Chechnya.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.127
Hospitals and schools.

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.682
Perhaps this is a joke?

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.201
You have added a zero to test me.

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.969
The figure is correct.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.766
Where did this money come from?

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.215
It has come to him

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:58.322
in the form of an inheritance.

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:02.295
My client has come to regard it as unclean

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:05.055
and seeks your guidance in disposing of it

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.003
in a manner befitting your religion.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.571
You're an honorable man, I believe that.

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:18.809
<i>But tell me, why should I trust you?</i>

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.815
<i>We must trust each other surely.</i>

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:25.255
I am willing, under my
client's instruction,

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:27.455
to arrange for significant funds

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:28.845
to be transferred to you.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.135
You are known as a religious man.

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.935
A trusted man.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.615
I accept you will direct this money

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:39.483
to the purpose he intends.

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.441
Why this urgency?

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:46.046
My client's legal status
in Germany is insecure.

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:49.684
I would recommend you accept this gift now,

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.575
because he may not be in a position

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.840
to offer it much longer.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.725
<i>Mr. Brue.</i>

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.646
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.489
Doctor, this way, please.

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.935
Dr. Abdullah, may I introduce

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.095
your benefactor, Issa Karpov,

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:30.124
and his lawyer, Miss Richter.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.855
I wish to speak with Issa alone.

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.245
Of course.

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.125
Miss Richter?

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.440
<i>Please tell me,</i>

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:52.415
why you have decided

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.329
to make this generous gift?

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.282
Are you under duress?

01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:59.095
No.

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.495
Look at me.

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.727
It is unclean money, sir.

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:09.364
It belongs to a man who
has done great evil.

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.051
My father.

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:15.282
I wish to be free of him.

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:18.975
Whose sins do you renounce

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.655
by making this gift?

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.682
The sins of my father.

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.244
And your own sins?

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.522
I believe you feel lost,

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.169
without God or love.

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.361
You must choose the path of Allah.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:45.245
Only then will you be truly
free of this burden.

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:04.415
I am satisfied, Mr. Brue,
that his offer is genuine.

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:05.771
Wonderful.

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:13.615
This is a list of charities,
with their banking details,

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:14.880
for your verification.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.000
Please.

01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.970
It seems in order.

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.766
I will await further instruction.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.726
Michael.

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:02.490
Welcome to Berlin.

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:06.641
Everyone got my report?

01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:07.921
Yes.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:11.095
You need to concentrate on Burgdorf,

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:12.724
Ministry of the Interior.

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:15.695
The final decision will be his.

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:19.895
I'm going to need passports
for Karpov and the Turks.

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:21.255
We don't do passports.

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.655
He gave the lawyer his word.

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:26.321
I did, and this time
I want it to mean something.

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.850
It's up there.

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:15.815
We've checked every name
on the charity list.

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.524
They're all clean.

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.883
Herr Bachmann, please.

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.921
You're looking at me, at us,

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.855
but we don't exist,

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.803
not legally, not officially,

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:39.215
because German intelligence
needs a job to be done

01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.535
that German law won't let it do,

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:45.451
so me and my people we stay small.

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:47.725
We stay on the streets.

01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.009
We make the weather.

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:54.407
Our sources don't come to us, we find them.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:58.090
We become their friends.

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.455
Their brothers, their fathers,

01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.608
their lovers, if we have to.

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:07.655
When they're ours, and only then,

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.295
we direct them at bigger targets.

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:13.375
It takes a minnow to catch a barracuda.

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.289
A barracuda to catch a shark.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.295
I don't fish, Herr Bachmann.

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:18.685
It's a metaphor, Erhardt.

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.215
Just a metaphor.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:22.615
We take our time.

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.608
We watch. We wait.

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.682
We see what Allah provides.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.975
Well, this time Allah has provided

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.049
Issa Karpov and his ill-gotten millions.

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:39.968
As you can see from the report
my team has compiled,

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:46.255
Dr. Abdullah has provided
an extensive list of his favorite charities

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.965
to be the recipients of those millions.

01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.283
Each one of those charities
has been CIA cleared.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.526
It is my belief he will replace

01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:59.120
one of the names on this list with another.

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.805
Seven Friends Navigation Company.

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.762
What kind of proof can you show us?

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:09.135
Proof is what we're looking for.

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.003
If this Abdullah,

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.086
if this barracuda,
if I've understood the metaphor,

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.935
takes the bait,

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.770
with what leverage
will you secure his cooperation?

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.767
On the negative,

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:27.361
threat of prosecution, prison,

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:31.727
public humiliation,
discrediting of his charities,

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:35.255
um, deportation of his wife and children.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.965
I choose the positive.

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:43.808
Amnesty, citizenship, for which he
has applied half a dozen times.

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:47.490
Now we are offering
citizenship to financiers of terror?

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:51.324
You are all familiar with
the operational plan?

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:55.815
We have three hours
to apprehend Abdullah and make him ours

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:58.855
and get him back home
before anyone notices.

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:00.775
And if he does not comply?

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:01.895
Then he's yours.

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:04.295
Do with him whatever you need to do.

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.575
And Issa Karpov?

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.215
He's to be left alone.

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:11.255
In my eyes it's unacceptable.

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:13.895
Find someone else to parade
before the cameras.

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.495
That was agreed.

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.495
He has our protection.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.966
Martha, what is the American perspective?

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:23.975
Maybe if you could define for us

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.243
what you think
the long-term objective would be.

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.489
What are we trying to achieve?

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:36.129
To make the world a safer place.

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.404
Isn't that enough?

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:56.251
Mr. Brue?

01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:58.890
Tomorrow morning.

01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:01.767
Thank you for letting me know.

01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:17.250
How are you feeling?

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:19.121
Good.

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:25.403
You drop him at the bank
and then you disappear.

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:28.690
Do you understand?

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:33.287
You are forcing me to betray my own father.

01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:37.809
You are not betraying him.
You are saving him.

01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.330
That is an act of love.

01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.642
He's been granted asylum.

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.568
It was the best I could do.

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:14.325
I gave you Issa.

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:17.448
Issa gives you Abdullah.

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:19.366
What's next?

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.095
What will you do to him?

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.175
To Abdullah?

01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:24.247
Yes.

01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:27.325
Nothing bad.

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:29.041
I promise.

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:03.161
Look.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.764
What does this mean?

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.970
It means you can stay.

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:35.162
I have something for you.

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:37.408
<i>- Doctor.
- Hello, Mr. Brue.</i>

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.935
<i>This confirms the receipt of funds</i>

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:30.895
<i>from Mr. Karpov</i>

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:34.775
<i>in to your new account we've set up here.</i>

01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:39.806
<i>These are the charities
you specified with their bank details.</i>

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:47.290
<i>Each of the transfers is logged in
to our system and is ready to go.</i>

01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:52.005
<i>Would you please check all the details?</i>

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:55.135
<i>The name of the account holders</i>

01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:57.375
<i>and the money assigned to each recipient</i>

01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:00.722
<i>and then authorize each one
with your signature.</i>

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.695
<i>I would like to make a substitute.</i>

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.688
<i>I need to change a name.</i>

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:01.775
<i>Seven Friends Navigation Company?</i>

01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:02.895
<i>Yes.</i>

01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:05.215
<i>It is a shipping company,</i>

01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:07.720
<i>but one whose business is charity.</i>

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:11.495
<i>We can have all the aid in the world</i>

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:15.570
<i>but it's worthless unless you can get it
to the people who need it.</i>

01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.447
<i>Yes.</i>

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:21.367
<i>All right.</i>

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:50.571
<i>Your final signature.</i>

01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:25.215
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.571
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:57.529
Unfortunately my son is delayed.

01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:00.169
Allow us to call you a taxi.

01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:02.369
- I'm going in.
- Good luck.

01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:03.881
Right.

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:16.201
Yes.

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:19.248
Taxi for Brue Freres.

01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.765
A pleasure.

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:09.971
<i>As-salam.</i>

01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:16.764
My direction, Blankenese.

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:29.440
Stay back!

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:32.161
Wait.

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:34.887
Stop! What are you doing?

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.240
- Wait.
- No!

01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:39.570
No.

01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:41.055
Issa!

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:42.295
- What's going on?
- No!

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:43.446
No!

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:45.175
Stand up.

01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:46.281
No!

01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:50.566
No!

01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:52.485
Issa, no!

01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:54.648
Stop it! No!

01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:56.365
No, Issa!

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:26.484
Fuck!

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.207
Fuck!
