WEBVTT

00:09.592 --> 00:13.346
In just a few moments, we'll be arriving
at our first stop on the tour,

00:13.430 --> 00:17.017
the Freddy house
from <i>Nightmare on Elm Street.</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:22.605
I know that Freddy Krueger doesn't live
in an actual house in the movie.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.982
We just call it the Freddy house.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.860
Thanks for pointing out the thing
that everybody always points out.

00:26.943 --> 00:30.697
-Hey, guys, I'm super hyped for this tour.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.866
Yeah. Me too, buddy.
It's gonna be good.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.784
I don't want to set the bar too high here,

00:34.868 --> 00:38.329
but I truly feel this will be the best day
of our lives.

00:39.581 --> 00:42.709
I totally agree,
and I've had a lot of good days. Whoa!

00:44.085 --> 00:46.838
Okay, this is the best day of my life!

01:05.732 --> 01:08.359
Hang on.
Are these all scary movie locations?

01:08.443 --> 01:13.114
-You said movie locations.
-No, I said horror movie locations.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.867
No, you didn't. I would've remembered
if you'd said that.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.869
I hate horror movies.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.038
Why watch a movie that scares me?

01:20.121 --> 01:23.249
That's like watching a movie
that makes me thirsty.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.710
Why would I want that?
I don't like feeling that way.

01:26.377 --> 01:29.923
To your right is the house
from <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street,</i>

01:30.006 --> 01:33.802
-the Freddy house.
-Oh! Oh!

01:33.885 --> 01:35.428
So cool!

01:40.475 --> 01:42.143
Oh, that's unmistakable.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.062
Hello?

01:44.145 --> 01:45.480
<i>I'm still at your place.</i>

01:45.563 --> 01:47.482
I threw up in a dumpster.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.317
Notice the red door...

01:49.400 --> 01:51.528
Oh, my God. Holy shit, are you okay?

01:52.821 --> 01:55.865
Yeah, I think
I just had to expel some stuff.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.119
Do you want me to come back?

01:59.202 --> 02:00.036
<i>Or...</i>

02:00.120 --> 02:03.289
Um... No.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.917
It's not that serious. I'll be fine.

02:06.626 --> 02:11.047
Okay, 'cause if you want me to,
I'll gladly just drop this and come.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.342
I wouldn't wanna come
unless you want me to.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.012
No, no, I'll be fine. You should stay.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.514
<i>Okay. Uh...</i>

02:19.597 --> 02:22.058
Well, you know, get better.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.727
If at any point you want me to come back,

02:24.811 --> 02:28.731
just give me a holler
and I'll zoom right over. Okay?

02:29.232 --> 02:30.567
Okay. Thanks, Gus-Gus.

02:31.151 --> 02:35.572
Okay, thank you. I mean, get well.
Okay, bye.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.491
To which Freddy replies,

02:39.159 --> 02:42.745
"Okay, but I get the first slice."

03:06.519 --> 03:10.356
Maybe we could ask this guy
about any regular filming locations.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.902
Like Sheldon's house.
Something light and fun. Like, where the Gilmore girls live?
Ruby gets it.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.033
-Yeah. Yeah.

03:21.784 --> 03:23.578
You seem a little disgruntled.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.705
Yeah. I don't know, I just--

03:26.623 --> 03:28.917
I'm thinking maybe
I should go check on Mickey.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.794
It feels weird to stay here
and... I don't know.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.880
It feels like a test or something.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.632
If it sounds like a test,
it's a test, right?

03:35.715 --> 03:38.927
When has anyone ever been like,
"Maybe this is a test?"

03:39.010 --> 03:41.012
Then it turns out it's not a test.

03:41.095 --> 03:43.556
I, one time, went to a Super Bowl party

03:43.640 --> 03:46.768
the same day my girlfriend
found out she got Lyme disease.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.312
-I got an F on that test.
-Yeah.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.147
What do you think, Ruby?

03:51.940 --> 03:54.234
I had a bunch of edibles earlier.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.195
I'm not the type of person
to answer relationship questions.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.744
Listen to me, Gus. Listen.
You have to get back to that apartment.

04:05.245 --> 04:09.582
This is the fucking relationship LSATs
and if you fail this thing,

04:09.666 --> 04:11.876
there'll be a day when you think
you're cruising on easy street.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.754
Could be tomorrow, a week from now
or months from now,

04:14.837 --> 04:16.047
where you're chilling and like,

04:16.130 --> 04:18.383
"Mickey, can you get me
a granola bar off the fridge?"

04:18.466 --> 04:21.386
And she goes,
"Why don't you get it off the bus?"

04:21.469 --> 04:24.055
That's her blindsiding you,
and you don't wanna be blindsided.

04:24.138 --> 04:26.182
-Right. Okay.
-Get off this bus.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.560
Excuse me. Excuse me,
can you stop the bus?

04:29.644 --> 04:30.520
What?

04:31.020 --> 04:33.189
I'm sorry, can you stop the bus?

04:34.774 --> 04:37.235
Pull over the bus, Ed.
We got a broken arrow.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.155
Sorry, I just...

04:41.239 --> 04:42.699
Sorry, folks.

04:42.782 --> 04:46.077
This gentleman's become too scared
by the horrors he's seen. He has to exit.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.122
I'm not scared,
I gotta take care of my girlfriend.

04:49.497 --> 04:52.834
Whatever, buddy. You're not better than me
'cause you have a girlfriend. Okay?

04:53.584 --> 04:56.296
I-- I didn't mean that, that way.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.131
You brought up the girlfriend,
so you think you're better

04:58.214 --> 04:59.674
and you think I don't have one,
which you're right,

04:59.757 --> 05:00.925
but it's not important, so just leave.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.598
Awww!

05:08.808 --> 05:10.351
Mickey the sicky.

05:11.811 --> 05:12.729
Hey.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.565
What

05:15.648 --> 05:16.983
I wanted to come back.

05:17.066 --> 05:20.153
It didn't feel right for me
to be out there while you're here,

05:20.236 --> 05:24.907
so I'm here. I wanna take care of you.
Okay, so...

05:24.991 --> 05:26.701
You left your tour for me.

05:26.784 --> 05:29.370
I wanted to.
It was the easiest decision.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.247
I wanna be here for you, okay?

05:31.956 --> 05:34.459
You can come closer to me
'cause I'm not contagious.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.002
It's food poisoning.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.004
Oh.

05:38.087 --> 05:41.340
Okay. Well, I'll come over to ya.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.633
-Hi.
-Hey.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.803
Sorry, excuse me. I don't wanna sit on
your little tootsies there.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.263
-Mm-hmm.

05:47.346 --> 05:50.933
Yeah. So, why do you think
it's food poisoning?

05:51.017 --> 05:54.520
'Cause when I got this crab cake
at Seafood Now,

05:54.979 --> 05:57.899
as soon as I bit into it,
it tasted rotten.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.319
I don't wanna talk about it too much
'cause it makes me wanna puke.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.112
I get that. I understand.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.114
Oh, God. Oh, God.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.408
-It's all right.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.451
Hmm.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.286
Buckle up,

06:10.370 --> 06:15.333
because our next stop is the Wallace house
from the <i>Halloween</i> franchise.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.836
Uh

06:18.920 --> 06:21.172
-From the <i>Halloween</i> franchise,

06:21.255 --> 06:24.467
-one of our most famous portrayers...
-Oh, my fucking God.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.136
of Michael Myers-- Glenn Michener.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.764
Yeah!

06:29.847 --> 06:31.099
Thanks.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.058
Yeah!

06:32.141 --> 06:35.269
Please keep in mind
that we will get inside.

06:35.353 --> 06:38.064
Try to remember
that this is only possible due

06:38.147 --> 06:40.942
to the kindness of the homeowners.

06:41.025 --> 06:44.153
Have your fun, right?
But also be respectful,

06:44.237 --> 06:47.782
because they are redoing the floors
in the guest bath.

06:48.616 --> 06:52.203
-You got it, sir.
These guys get it.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.248
Yeah.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.043
Hey, hey, hey.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.674
How you feeling

07:07.969 --> 07:09.053
What'd you get me?

07:09.137 --> 07:11.055
Oh, got you all kinds of goodies.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.142
Got you this little guy.

07:14.225 --> 07:19.730
I swam
the Pacific to tell you, "Get well."

07:22.108 --> 07:23.568
Sorry, that's stupid. I don't even know.

07:23.651 --> 07:26.696
The guy made me get it,
and I didn't really want to.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.532
But I got you some basics.

07:29.615 --> 07:35.663
Got you a little tea
and some Pepto that you wanted.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.249
Did you get me an <i>US Weekly?</i>

07:38.332 --> 07:41.669
And I got you this.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.548
Just in case you were wondering
if the stars were just like us.

07:45.631 --> 07:49.177
-I have been wondering. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.345
Thanks for getting all this stuff.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.388
Of course, baby.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.349
You want something to drink?

07:56.934 --> 07:58.769
Gatorade.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.149
You got blue Gatorade?

08:05.443 --> 08:08.196
From the way you said it, you love blue?

08:08.738 --> 08:12.909
I thought that was universally accepted
as the worst flavor of Gatorade.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.371
Oh. Okay, sorry.

08:18.289 --> 08:22.084
It's just when you're super sick,
you know exactly what you want.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.003
Okay, yeah, I guess.

08:26.547 --> 08:29.050
I can't believe they kept the same lights.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.177
-Even the Christmas lights.
-His family was just sitting there.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.262
How was it No. You fucked up.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.973
It's like a carnival in there.
It's awesome.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.184
Yeah. Michael Myers fucking loves us.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.393
-Thanks to Kevin.
-Yeah.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.687
All I did was act like
I had no idea who he was.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.231
-Celebrities love that.
-Yeah.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.274
I think it's 'cause
it makes them feel like they're normal.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.526
But they're not, they're way better. Ten times better.

08:47.860 --> 08:53.074
So, near the end of the film,
Jamie Lee Curtis starts saying to me,

08:53.157 --> 08:56.035
"Glenn, you're the best Mike Myers
we've had."

08:56.118 --> 08:58.120
-And I'm like...
-"The best."

08:58.204 --> 09:02.750
Yeah. I guess so.
I guess it's a compliment.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.002
It is a compliment.
That's very beautiful.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.088
So, you guys wanna do something?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.882
Uh... What do you mean?

09:09.966 --> 09:11.050
I don't know.

09:11.133 --> 09:14.303
Leave here, get a drink, hang out.
Why not, right?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.097
-Yeah, we should do it.
Sure.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.600
-I guess we could for a little bit.
-Let's hang out with Glenn Michener. <i>♪ Soupy, soup, soup</i>
<i>Everybody like the soup, soup ♪</i>

09:23.187 --> 09:27.108
<i>♪ Mickey, get some soup, soup </i>

09:27.191 --> 09:29.318
Your phone buzzed. It looks like...

09:29.986 --> 09:32.071
your friends are hanging out
with some old dude.

09:34.699 --> 09:38.786
Holy shit!
They're hanging out with Michael Myers.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.665
They're hanging out with this guy Glenn.
He played Michael Myers.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.417
The cool thing about him was,

09:44.500 --> 09:47.169
he was this guy
who put his own stamp on it.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.299
Doesn't matter, it's fine.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.093
Sorry, I'm just having
a hard time following.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.805
Ah!

09:58.723 --> 10:02.560
Oh, my God. They're just hanging out
with Glenn Michener.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.937
They're having a blast
with Glenn Michener.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.564
He's got his arm around Ruby.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.065
So, what,

10:08.149 --> 10:10.651
Ruby and Glenn Michener
are just like BFFs now?

10:10.735 --> 10:14.238

Hey there, bud.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.286
You okay?

11:45.121 --> 11:49.500
No, I got this sharp pain
in my stomach.

11:50.709 --> 11:55.047
I'm also really hot and then I get cold,
and then...

11:56.340 --> 11:58.551
Fuck... Is this how you felt?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.554
I just threw up, so...

12:02.930 --> 12:04.598
You feel like you're gonna throw up?

12:06.559 --> 12:07.393
I do.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.979
I don't wanna talk about it,
'cause if I talk about it,

12:10.062 --> 12:14.150
then it's gonna happen,
so let's just not go there.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.153
Let's just-- Let's shut up.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.655
Shut up now.

12:21.615 --> 12:24.577
I'm sorry. I really thought
I had food poisoning.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.706
Why would you be sorry, Mickey?

12:29.748 --> 12:31.375
Well, 'cause you're sick.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.711
Right.

12:33.794 --> 12:38.924
Well, I'm sorry that I'm sick,
'cause now I can't take care of you.

12:39.008 --> 12:43.804
So, it really more sucks for you.
So, sorry.

12:45.055 --> 12:49.101
No, I'm feeling
like the nausea is passing, so I'm okay.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.358
What are you doing?
Stop hitting your head against the wall.

12:57.359 --> 13:00.070
-No. No.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.238
I don't like this.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.781
Okay, can I help?

13:02.865 --> 13:05.159
No. No.

13:15.127 --> 13:18.464
I'm okay. It's all right, stay there.

13:18.547 --> 13:22.384
I don't like to be looked after.
It makes me uncomfortable.

13:23.427 --> 13:26.180
I don't wanna be a pain in the butt
to you.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.101
-Okay.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.939
I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be a dick.
I'm just...

13:36.148 --> 13:37.733
I just need to go off and...

13:38.901 --> 13:42.863
Like an animal does and just die
or hibernate or something.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.283
I'm gonna leave the door open,

13:46.367 --> 13:49.870
so if you need anything,
I'm not shutting you out, I just...

13:50.621 --> 13:52.748
Fuck.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.260
-Thank you.
Take a shot, take a shot.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.554
-That's so many shot glasses.
-Yes. Uh-huh.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.891
There's a lot of shot glasses
for a lot of drinking.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.976
Now, to Michael Myers.

14:54.059 --> 14:54.935
Yeah.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.313
To Michael Myers.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.237
Yes!

15:06.488 --> 15:09.909
Let us get to rap sessioning.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.619
Come on.

15:12.786 --> 15:15.998
-Shit. Fuck. God damn it.
-You want help or are you...

15:16.081 --> 15:19.251
I got it. I got it. Cool, man.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.461
Cool.

15:20.544 --> 15:23.714
-Yeah.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.633
So, rap session.

15:26.467 --> 15:29.637
Yeah.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.556
What's your favorite horror scary movie?

15:34.683 --> 15:37.353
I'm kind of scared right now,
to be honest with you.

15:37.811 --> 15:40.064
These guys.

15:40.147 --> 15:44.610
You're a funny guy.
Funny, that's what it's about.

15:45.653 --> 15:49.281
Okay. I'll ask another question then,
funny guy.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.326
What is your greatest fear?

15:53.827 --> 15:55.829
Ghosts. Without a doubt, ghosts.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.417
We all know that ghosts don't exist.

16:00.918 --> 16:05.881
When you're dead, you're dead.
That's it. End of story.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.967
Okay. What's your second biggest fear?

16:09.593 --> 16:11.679
Probably that my girlfriend
will break up with me.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.138
Hmm.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.058
-Okay. Let me see a pic of her.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.812
Yeah, because my advice is
to confront your fear.

16:19.895 --> 16:24.233
And that is telling me
you need to dump her right now. Okay?

16:24.316 --> 16:26.402
-I know I've got one here somewhere.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.903
-Hold on.
-Here she is.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.072
Great. Okay.

16:30.155 --> 16:36.036
Forget it! Oh, my gazoongas!

16:36.120 --> 16:41.834
You have sold the farm and gone to heaven.
You need to hang on to this one, right?

16:41.917 --> 16:43.544
That's my plan.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.380
-Ran-man, that's the plan. Okay.
-Yeah.

16:48.382 --> 16:51.885
You're nothing to sneeze at
yourself there, lady legs.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.972
Okay. No.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.435
No, thank you. But thanking you a lot.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.772
How about you, man in jeans?

17:04.732 --> 17:05.607
What?

17:06.942 --> 17:09.236
Yeah. So, you guys like to party?

17:10.195 --> 17:13.741
-I don't know if I wanna party with...
-I like parties. Parties are great.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.784
Okay. All right.

17:15.868 --> 17:19.538
Let me whip up some popcorn.
Stay right here. Okay?

17:21.415 --> 17:23.500
We gotta get the fuck out
of here immediately.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.085
-Yeah. This is getting weird.
-Come on.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.880
I hope you guys like relaxing butter.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.924
I'm out of here.
He's creepy.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.552
-We can't leave without saying goodbye.
Who is he?

17:33.635 --> 17:36.513
Chris, come back.
Guys, he's making us popcorn.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.681
It's stuck.
Other way.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.308
What are you doing?
You keep locking and unlocking it.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.769
It's stuck. I'm turning it!
What is wrong with you?

17:41.852 --> 17:42.853
Chris!

17:42.936 --> 17:46.398
Guys, he's popping up popcorn for us.

17:47.941 --> 17:52.488
Okay. So, I whipped up a small batch,
just half a bowl...

17:53.739 --> 17:56.033
Where did everyone go?

17:56.116 --> 17:59.995
Those guys...
they don't like butter in their popcorn.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.957
They had to work early,
so they couldn't have slippery fingers.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.126
You know what?

18:06.877 --> 18:09.797
Fuck 'em. That's right. Fuck those guys.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.926
Yeah!
-Yeah!

18:14.009 --> 18:16.345
-Let's chow down, man.
-Glenn!

18:34.905 --> 18:36.115
Knock, knock.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.619
Hey.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.248
-Tried your blue Gatorade.
-Yay.

18:44.331 --> 18:47.209
-Wasn't that bad, actually.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.714
Do you want some?

18:54.216 --> 18:56.677
Let's see. Let's test this out.

19:05.936 --> 19:06.854
That's good stuff.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.482
I'll love it forever.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.865
Can I sit with you,
or do you still wanna be alone?

19:19.867 --> 19:22.870
Ah... Come here. Come here.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.915
My Mickey. Come here.

19:28.333 --> 19:32.671
-Let's be sick. Let's be sick.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.639
Really took it out of me.
I don't even think Stella got this sick.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.267
Wait, Stella was sick?

19:49.021 --> 19:53.901
-Yeah.
Like, us sick?

19:57.654 --> 19:59.781
Now that I think about it, yeah.

19:59.865 --> 20:03.994
After her,
maybe a couple other people got sick.

20:06.246 --> 20:08.207
What the fuck?

20:08.290 --> 20:09.750
Mickey, that's...

20:10.626 --> 20:13.253
That's fine, but that's baffling to me,

20:14.171 --> 20:19.092
'cause if I was working somewhere
and somebody I worked with got sick,

20:19.176 --> 20:21.595
and then I saw two or three other people
getting sick,

20:21.678 --> 20:25.349
I would be like, "I need
to Purell like a motherfucker now

20:25.432 --> 20:28.685
and quarantine myself
from the rest of the universe."

20:28.769 --> 20:31.271
I'm sorry that I'm not a germophobe
like you.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.816
Don't make me out
to be Howard Hughes, okay?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.902
It's just being responsible.

20:36.985 --> 20:39.196
If I got sick, I would know

20:39.279 --> 20:42.282
where I got sick, how I got sick,
why, when.

20:44.409 --> 20:47.704
It's just baffling to me.
I don't understand it.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.335
Sorry. Jesus.

20:54.127 --> 20:56.213
I fucked up and you're perfect.
What do you want me to say?

20:56.296 --> 21:01.009
I just-- I don't know
how you could be foggy about this.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.261
Do you--

21:03.053 --> 21:04.638
Do you think

21:05.389 --> 21:08.100
Do you not care

21:15.357 --> 21:17.609
-So mean.
-I'm not trying to be mean.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.903
Maybe I was foggy because I was sick.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.657
I'm not trying to be mean.

21:23.740 --> 21:29.079
I'm just saying what I would do
in the situation and you didn't do it.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.873
I guess your priorities are different,
and that's fine, but...

21:31.957 --> 21:35.919
That fucking crab cake tasted rotten
last night, Gus.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.547
And I wasn't sick
and then I just threw up.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.300
Doesn't that sound like food poisoning
to you?

21:47.055 --> 21:48.015
What?

21:48.098 --> 21:49.933
I gotta go to the bathroom again...

21:51.059 --> 21:53.979
because I'm sick.
Because I'm fucking sick.

21:54.062 --> 21:58.942
I gotta go to the bathroom again,
and it's just a hell, nightmarescape.

22:00.694 --> 22:05.115
It's nights like these
that really put hair on your nipples.

22:06.908 --> 22:07.951
Randy?

22:08.744 --> 22:11.288
I've got, like, a confession to make.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.082
-Yeah.

22:14.833 --> 22:19.880
I lied to you earlier when you opened up
about your fear of the paranormal.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.049
Hmm. What do you mean?

22:22.883 --> 22:28.430
I'm talking about ghosts, Randy.
Ghosts are fucking real.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.391
Come on. No, they're not. I'm stupid.

22:32.392 --> 22:36.188
They're as real as real can be.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.815
As real as aliens.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.820
I used to be king of the world.

22:43.904 --> 22:48.241
I used to be Michael fucking Myers.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.952
And now look at me.

22:51.787 --> 22:52.996
A loser.

22:54.247 --> 22:58.668
I've shrunk about a half an inch
over the past year.

22:59.586 --> 23:00.879
I lost...

23:01.546 --> 23:02.714
no weight.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.384
I'm broke.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.721
And I live in a shithole of an apartment.

23:12.474 --> 23:18.563
So, you wanna know
how I know that ghosts exist, Randy?

23:20.065 --> 23:22.734
You're looking at one. Right now.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.029
But...

23:27.030 --> 23:29.408
it's a metaphor. It's a metaphor.

23:30.075 --> 23:36.248
Do you know what it's like
to have a mask on most of the day?

23:37.332 --> 23:38.917
Well, I'll tell you something.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.837
It's not fun.

23:41.920 --> 23:45.132
Anybody could be under that mask.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.801
I'm not kidding myself.

23:48.718 --> 23:55.642
One day, I was so hungover,
I had to get my cousin to take my place...

23:57.310 --> 24:02.357
and nobody even noticed
when he was Mike Myers.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.318
And he's a fucking CPA.

24:06.653 --> 24:12.450
And now, now that I've gotten really real
and, you know, street with you,

24:12.534 --> 24:16.455
I was like, "You're gonna leave me,
just like your friends.

24:16.913 --> 24:19.332
Just like everybody leaves me."

24:19.416 --> 24:20.250
Hey...

24:22.377 --> 24:23.753
I'm not going anywhere.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.340
You're the reason
that I'm so scared of horror movies.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.093
No. Stop it.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.845
The choices that you made...

24:32.721 --> 24:36.725
like, you would move all stiff,
like you couldn't move at all.

24:36.808 --> 24:37.767
Yeah.

24:37.851 --> 24:41.229
Then all of a sudden,
you would run super, super fast.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.689
Yeah, that's my trademark.

24:42.772 --> 24:46.943
But, now that I've met you,
I met the real you.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.821
The man behind the mask, you know?

24:51.031 --> 24:52.449
I'm not scared anymore.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.285
I never have to be
scared again, because...

24:56.244 --> 24:58.079
you're more than a mask. You're like...

24:59.206 --> 25:00.999
you're like my hero.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.336
You don't have to say that.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.880
It's true.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.382
You're Michael Myers.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.385
No.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.638
Even better.

25:15.722 --> 25:17.349
You're Glenn Michener.

25:17.766 --> 25:21.520
Randy, I just wanted to say that...

25:22.354 --> 25:23.605
maybe...

25:24.397 --> 25:27.359
if you're not doing anything, maybe...

25:28.109 --> 25:31.029
we could watch one of the <i>Halloweens?</i>

25:33.281 --> 25:36.076
-I'd like that a lot.
-Great.

25:36.159 --> 25:39.371
I'll fire up the VCR. It's in the bedroom.

25:48.588 --> 25:52.259
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck, this sucks.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.844
This fucking sucks, Mickey.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.805
If I had known you were contagious...

25:56.888 --> 25:58.932
You would have gone
and hung out with your friends,

25:59.015 --> 26:00.809
which is what you wanted to do anyway?

26:01.685 --> 26:03.520
I would've steered clear of you. I would've washed my hands.
I wouldn't have kissed you.

26:05.522 --> 26:09.609
This is why I did not want your help,
because there's always strings attached.

26:10.151 --> 26:13.613
There are no strings attached
to this, Mickey. Okay?

26:13.697 --> 26:17.617
It's not actually help
when you expect something in return.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.744
-You're always keeping score.
-I'm not keeping score.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.706
You can't believe
I'd wanna be here for you.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.708
Yeah, and you know why
I don't believe that?

26:24.791 --> 26:27.502
'Cause when I told you I was sick,
you hesitated.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.045
No, I didn't wanna come running to you,

26:29.129 --> 26:31.131
because I know that'd be a turn off
for you.

26:31.214 --> 26:32.215
What?

26:32.799 --> 26:34.551
You want me to be an asshole boyfriend.

26:34.634 --> 26:37.095
You want me to be the guy
who's hanging out with his friends

26:37.178 --> 26:39.723
and treats you like shit. I don't know.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.516
Yeah, you don't fucking know!

26:41.599 --> 26:44.728
I dated that guy 16 times.
I don't want that shit anymore.

26:44.811 --> 26:49.566
I don't wanna be the codependent,
clingy guy who comes on too strong--

26:49.649 --> 26:51.151
Be whoever you are!

26:51.234 --> 26:52.819
Then I'm the guy who does stupid shit

26:52.902 --> 26:53.945
because he's scared of getting hurt.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.823
Yeah. Guess what. So's everybody!

26:56.906 --> 27:00.243
Why are you yelling at me?
I just want you to feel better!

27:00.327 --> 27:02.078
I know that you want me to be better
'cause you love me!

27:02.162 --> 27:03.747
Yeah, and you love me!

27:21.139 --> 27:22.140
I love you.

27:23.391 --> 27:25.018
I love you, too.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.941
-This is so dumb.
-I know.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.443
Stupid.

27:34.110 --> 27:35.612
I'm sorry I got you sick.

27:37.697 --> 27:39.532
We'll get through it.
