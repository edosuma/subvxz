01:02.040 --> 01:05.080
Are you taking it out? Oh...

01:10.560 --> 01:13.520
Look at this. A man in misery.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.960
Who's in misery?
The King, according to Robert.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.680
Why? He has to deal with a Labour
government. Why do you think?

01:19.720 --> 01:22.440
He doesn't look miserable to me.
He just looks like himself.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.800
What is your objection to Mr MacDonald? That
the Prime Minister is the son of a crofter?

01:26.840 --> 01:30.040
I couldn't care less if he was
the son of Fu Manchu.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.440
What worries me is that our
government is committed

01:32.480 --> 01:35.440
to the destruction of people like us
and everything we stand for.

01:35.480 --> 01:38.040
Well, let's wait and see what
happens before we panic.

01:38.080 --> 01:41.880
Where's Edith? She had some old lady
to see in the village.

01:41.920 --> 01:45.480
What about you? Is everything
settled at the school? What's this?

01:45.520 --> 01:49.320
They swore in Mr Adams' replacement on
the school board. It all went off smoothly.

01:49.360 --> 01:52.440
I thought they might have asked me.
I feel guilty about the school.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.000
I ought to support it more.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.680
Well, I'm giving away the prizes
this year. Come with me.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.400
Barrow, can we clear the tea?

01:58.440 --> 02:01.040
Lady Edith's missed it, and Nanny
will be down shortly.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.120
I'd better run.
Oh, stay and see them.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.800
Just as soon as they're able to
answer back.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.759
Sybbie CAN answer back.
True. Why does she call me Donk?

02:09.800 --> 02:12.320
That game you played - pinning the
tail on the donkey.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.800
Can't I be Grandpapa or something
dignified?

02:14.840 --> 02:16.760
I'm afraid it's Donk for the moment.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.520
I don't want George to catch it.
Here they are.

02:19.560 --> 02:23.040
Here's your grandfather now.
Bye-bye, darlings. Goodbye, Donk.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.160
George, come and sit here, darling.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.080
Put it there and I'll see to it.
Oh, don't be like that.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.680
Ena can manage.

02:36.720 --> 02:41.920
Why should she, any more than me?
We've no proper kitchen maid now, so
we must all muck in.

02:41.960 --> 02:45.960
What's the matter? Daisy's grumbling
because they didn't replace Ivy.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.120
At Skelton Park, they're down to a
butler, a cook, two maids and a
cleaning woman, and that's it.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.520
How on earth does it work?
I couldn't tell you.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.720
Why have the people left?

02:56.760 --> 03:01.480
They prefer to be in factories or
shops. They like the hours better.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.800
Oh... I'll forget my head next.

03:03.840 --> 03:08.160
I came in to remind you it's their
34th wedding anniversary on Saturday week,

03:08.200 --> 03:10.840
so, if you want to do a cake, this
is an advance warning.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.800
I suppose there'll be a dinner of
some sort. Oh, I don't know.

03:14.840 --> 03:20.440
34 years! If I were to marry this
year, what would life be like in 1958?

03:20.480 --> 03:22.120
I doubt I'll be troubled by it.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.080
Do you think we'll leave service?

03:24.120 --> 03:28.400
Well, you'll be fine. You've got Mr
Mason's farm to go to. What about me?

03:28.440 --> 03:33.000
But could I? What do I know about farming
or ordering supplies or doing accounts?

03:33.040 --> 03:35.080
Suppose I can't tackle a new life.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.880
If it's all right with you, I've to
tackle tonight's dinner.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.200
Now, start the salmon pates,
while I do a lemon mayonnaise.

03:47.840 --> 03:52.720
We had good news today. Tim was asked
to be chief of the estate firemen.

03:52.760 --> 03:56.200
Oh, how nice. Many congratulations.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.080
Can I give you some more tea?
No, thank you.

04:03.280 --> 04:07.120
How about you, Marigold? Are you
quite finished?

04:07.160 --> 04:11.320
I just love to see her gurgling
away, so peaceful and happy.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.960
We've almost forgotten she's not one
of our own, haven't we, Tim?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.200
She's just lovely. How pretty your
hair is, darling.

04:18.240 --> 04:21.959
I do wonder where she got her
colouring, but I never knew her parents.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.800
No?
No.

04:23.840 --> 04:27.560
Her mother was an old friend of
Tim's, but I never met either of them.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.960
Oh, is that the time? We mustn't
hold you up.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.120
Good girl.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.840
Good girl.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.520
I should probably go.
Have you got your teddy?

04:47.560 --> 04:49.560
Say goodbye.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.120
Goodbye.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.320
Thank you for... Thank you.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.720
She's got a soft spot for you.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.760
Don't be daft.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.400
I do love this evening light.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.440
Oh, I must tell Lord Merton.

05:24.080 --> 05:28.680
Tease me if you will, but I don't
want to be pursued by him or Lord anyone.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.640
Well, that's a pity - he's asked me
to help him in his courtship.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.800
What?
He doesn't want to pester you,

05:33.840 --> 05:37.120
so he's asked if I could give another
luncheon party.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.200
Oh, dear.
Oh, why the lamentation?

05:39.240 --> 05:41.160
You don't have to see him.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.840
Well, you make it sound so easy.

05:42.880 --> 05:46.520
There's nothing simpler than avoiding
people you don't like.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.480
Avoiding one's friends - that's the
real test.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.240
But I do like him.
I think he's very nice.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.240
It's just, he wants something from
me that I cannot give.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.160
He just wants what all men want.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.200
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

06:00.560 --> 06:02.560
I was referring to companionship.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.800
As I hope you were.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.600
Oh, I didn't mean to disturb you.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.880
I'm sorry. It's a letter from Lady
Anstruther again.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.040
Blimey. She doesn't give up easily.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.640
Well, you know me.
'Irresistible' is my middle name.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.800
Well, was she like this when you
were working for her? Not as bad.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.280
She had to be more discreet with the
other servants.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.280
Hadn't you better go up to London
and put her out of her misery?

06:30.320 --> 06:31.760
Oh, don't tempt me...

06:31.800 --> 06:34.960
because I know this: If I weaken,
I'll pay for it.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.200
This sounds very like the kind of
boys' talk I do not allow.

06:39.240 --> 06:43.960
If you can both tear yourselves away
from your smutty deliberations,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
I need you both upstairs.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.840
Where is she?
I hope I'm not late.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.320
No, Carson hasn't come in yet.
That reminds me.

06:54.360 --> 06:58.000
We're to receive a village delegation
tomorrow. I ran into the Postmistress.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.040
She asked if they might pay us a
visit.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.720
Mrs Wigan?
What was it that reminded you?

07:02.760 --> 07:06.400
She asked for Carson to be present.
Why? What's it about?

07:06.440 --> 07:09.560
They want to erect some kind of
memorial to the war. What?

07:09.600 --> 07:12.720
Well, not to the war, but to the men,
the local men, who died in it.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.920
They'll be all over the country.
I suppose they want me as chairman.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.600
Who was it?
Tony Gillingham.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.320
He had some business up here, and
you told him he could stay.

07:20.360 --> 07:23.480
When does he want to come?
That's the problem. The 16th.

07:23.520 --> 07:26.160
And...?
It's our anniversary.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.480
Oh, that doesn't matter.
Ring him and say yes.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.960
We don't have to.
No. I'd like to see him.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.280
Right. That's dinner, everyone.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.160
You don't mind Tony coming, do you?
Not if it's what you want.

07:36.200 --> 07:41.080
I'll tell you what I want.
I want to inspire Tony Gillingham
with thoughts of marriage.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.920
So, does that mean Lord Gillingham
wins and Mr Blake can go whistle?

07:47.960 --> 07:52.400
I'm glad for them. Viscountess
Gillingham - it sounds quite smart.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.320
I think they'll be happy, and it'll
be good for Master George.

07:55.360 --> 07:58.920
It's a big thing, to take on the
task of raising another man's son.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.600
There's nothing to worry about
there. His Lordship's a kind man.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.960
I wish you'd tell me what you know
about those two.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.160
I don't know anything.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.840
What you suspect, then. And don't
deny it, because I've seen you.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.800
You can't stop looking at them when
you think no-one's looking.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.040
Can I join in?
Do you have to?

08:17.080 --> 08:20.120
How was it in York? Did you find
what you were looking for?

08:20.160 --> 08:24.080
I did. Took a bit of a search,
but I think I'm suited.

08:24.120 --> 08:27.280
What's that, then?
Oh, just something.

08:27.320 --> 08:30.000
A group's arriving from the village
tomorrow morning.

08:30.040 --> 08:33.400
Can you get one of the footmen to
bring coffee and something to eat at 11?

08:33.440 --> 08:36.520
Well, find me when you want it.
I can't. I'm in the meeting myself.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.360
That's why I'm telling you now.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.960
What's it for? I don't know, but His
Lordship asked me to be there.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.679
Well, I think it's fantastic.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.440
When did we last have a Prime Minister
who understood the working class? Never.

08:47.480 --> 08:50.920
It's a qualification that is
meaningless in terms of government.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.040
I'm not sure I can agree with you
there. I think it's important.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.800
Me too. Mr MacDonald will have real
experience of a hard life.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.640
He knows what most people go
through.

08:59.680 --> 09:03.160
Up the workers.
So, James is a revolutionary now!

09:03.200 --> 09:07.520
He's not a revolutionary. He believes in justice
for the majority. What's wrong with that?

09:07.560 --> 09:10.600
Nothing, but I suppose he can fight
his own battles.

09:10.640 --> 09:14.480
We'll have no fighting here,
thank you very much.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.160
You wouldn't mind heading
the war-memorial appeal, would you?

09:19.200 --> 09:23.520
I feel a bit embarrassed. I wasn't wounded.
I wasn't even allowed to fight.

09:23.560 --> 09:27.800
They should ask a man like General
McKee or Johnnie Raymond. Someone who
did their bit.

09:27.840 --> 09:32.440
You're their traditional leader and
they like you to pray with them, in
mourning and in gratitude.

09:32.480 --> 09:36.560
But I should be praying in the back
row, not the front. That's all.

09:44.680 --> 09:47.520
Please don't think us too forward.
You have no need to worry.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.280
I'm happy to play my part.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.680
But we don't know yet where we want
the memorial to be, m'lord. So...?

09:52.720 --> 09:57.640
Well, if you're to give us a piece of land, you'd
better know where it is before you agree.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.120
I'm sure I will agree, but is that
why you're here?

10:00.160 --> 10:02.800
To ask for a piece of land as the
site for this thing?

10:02.840 --> 10:04.960
That's why we're here to see you,
m'lord.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.240
But we'd also like to offer the
position of Chairman of our Committee -

10:08.280 --> 10:11.920
I'll take over now.
You were saying...?

10:11.960 --> 10:14.840
We'd like Mr Carson to be Chairman
of our Committee.

10:15.320 --> 10:18.640
But surely, His Lordship...?

10:18.680 --> 10:20.960
No, Carson.
They don't want me - they want you.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.800
I wouldn't put it like that, m'lord,

10:22.840 --> 10:26.160
but Mr Carson knew more of the young
men that died than you did.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.840
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Well, he knew them better.

10:28.880 --> 10:32.720
That's it. And he's a considerable
figure in the village.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.760
Tea, please.

10:35.480 --> 10:40.480
Carson? What do you say?
I am honoured by the invitation,

10:40.520 --> 10:42.440
but I shall have to think about it.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.480
Of course you will.
But please don't take too long.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.000
Can you put my milk in first,
if that's for me?

10:54.800 --> 10:57.920
Did that come in the second post?
It did.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.960
From Lady Anstruther.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.920
Not again? What's stoked her up?

11:02.960 --> 11:05.320
My fault. I shouldn't have sent her
the Valentine.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.400
Yes, but that was -
And I sent her another this year.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.880
How did she know they were from you?
Because I bloody signed them. Oh!

11:11.920 --> 11:15.320
I don't know what I was thinking.
It was supposed to be a joke.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.120
But, well, now it's got out of hand.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.440
Don't worry.

11:18.480 --> 11:22.480
One day I'll be a good boy and
settle down. We all settle down one day.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.520
We don't all have the option.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.480
Heavens! I wasn't expecting you.

11:30.520 --> 11:34.880
I've been to see Smithers at Oak
Field Farm. I just thought I'd look
in on my way home.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.920
I'm glad you did.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.120
I had a delegation from the village,

11:39.160 --> 11:41.440
about the new war memorial
they're putting up.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.880
Oh, they want you to head it?
No.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.160
They've invited Carson to be the
Chairman.

11:46.200 --> 11:49.920
Well, why not you?
The village wanted Carson.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.640
Your father always told the village
what they wanted.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.000
Hmm.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.560
Is it true old Dicky Merton
is paying court to Isobel?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.880
Isn't it absurd?

11:59.920 --> 12:04.320
Oh, it might be rather fun for her to reinvent
herself as a great lady of the county

12:04.360 --> 12:06.360
and put us all in our proper place.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.400
Yes, I suppose it would be fun.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.480
But you don't think she's keen?

12:10.520 --> 12:15.760
Oh, no, far from it. She never tires
of telling me.

12:19.384 --> 12:21.544
Daisy, this came for you in the
post.

12:21.584 --> 12:23.744
Thank you, Mr Carson.
Oh, what is it?

12:23.905 --> 12:25.865
Something I ordered.

12:25.905 --> 12:28.785
May we know what, O Queen?
Something I need.

12:28.825 --> 12:30.785
Why must it be a secret?

12:30.825 --> 12:34.305
Well, it would be a bit sad if she
had no secrets at her age.

12:36.545 --> 12:39.105
Have you made your decision about
the memorial?

12:39.145 --> 12:41.385
Oh, not yet.

12:41.425 --> 12:45.585
I'm not comfortable being placed
ahead of His Lordship.

12:45.625 --> 12:48.945
You should have seen his face,
Mrs Hughes. He felt very let down.

12:48.985 --> 12:51.545
It's the Committee's choice,
and they've chosen you.

12:51.585 --> 12:56.185
And the country's chosen a Labour government,
so people don't always get it right.

12:57.345 --> 12:58.985
What are you afraid of?

12:59.025 --> 13:02.825
I feel a shaking of the ground
I stand on.

13:02.865 --> 13:07.345
That everything I believe in will be
tested and held up for ridicule
over the next few years.

13:07.385 --> 13:11.385
Mr Carson, they've been testing the
system since the Romans left.

13:11.425 --> 13:13.185
Oh, I suppose that's true.

13:13.225 --> 13:17.665
The nature of life is not permanence
but flux.

13:18.185 --> 13:19.945
Just so...

13:19.985 --> 13:22.465
even if it does sound faintly
disgusting.

13:34.425 --> 13:38.185
There you are, m'lady.
Madge said you were going out.

13:38.225 --> 13:40.625
We were giving a turn-out to the
blue room,

13:40.665 --> 13:43.345
and this had been put on the shelf
with the other books.

13:43.385 --> 13:48.305
What is it? A German primer, but the
point is, it's not ours.

13:48.345 --> 13:53.985
Mr Gregson's written his name
in the fly-leaf. I see.

13:54.025 --> 13:57.465
I nearly gave it to Her Ladyship,
but it seemed more suitable -

13:57.505 --> 14:00.305
No. I'm the one who should have it.

14:03.945 --> 14:06.705
Can you please put it on the table
beside my bed?

14:06.745 --> 14:08.745
Of course.
Thank you.

14:09.665 --> 14:12.545
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon. Thank you, Molesley.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.745
It's good of you to come with us.

14:14.785 --> 14:16.825
I must have something to do.

14:16.865 --> 14:19.465
Where's your mother?
In the library.

14:23.185 --> 14:26.385
I'm not sure Tom's visiting the
school is such a good idea.

14:26.425 --> 14:30.545
He made a friend there of one of the
schoolmistresses when we were in London.

14:30.585 --> 14:32.345
What's wrong with that?

14:32.385 --> 14:37.265
I don't intend to explain, but I was
rather disappointed in him.
I would have hoped for better.

14:37.305 --> 14:40.105
You're being very mysterious.
Can't I know the details?

14:40.145 --> 14:42.145
You really don't need to.

14:43.065 --> 14:45.225
There you are. How were they?

14:45.265 --> 14:47.825
As dull as ever. They sent love.

14:47.865 --> 14:50.105
What was the meeting like?
Have you accepted?

14:50.145 --> 14:54.225
It wasn't me they came to see.
Well, they want me to give them some
land for the thing,

14:54.265 --> 14:56.305
but they asked Carson to be the
Chairman.

14:56.345 --> 14:58.665
Carson? Well, how nice.

15:00.785 --> 15:02.865
I'm going upstairs to take off
my hat.

15:03.785 --> 15:05.785
Well, she's pleased, anyway.

15:08.145 --> 15:10.145
Congratulations.

15:13.625 --> 15:18.665
I'm sure you will want me to thank
Lady Rose for consenting to present
the prizes today.

15:18.705 --> 15:21.185
We're always glad of interest from
the Abbey.

15:21.225 --> 15:23.585
And finally, thank you all for
coming.

15:23.625 --> 15:25.625
It is most appreciated.

15:39.145 --> 15:42.505
I'm glad Peter won a prize for
Geography. Well done, him.

15:42.545 --> 15:44.545
He didn't get that from his father.

15:45.225 --> 15:49.185
Is Mrs Drewe with you? No, she's at
home, looking after the young 'uns.

15:49.985 --> 15:51.985
We ought to talk, but not here.

15:52.705 --> 15:55.025
Tomorrow. At 11. By the stone barn.

15:59.145 --> 16:02.465
You've been away.
I've been on a course.

16:02.505 --> 16:05.705
I nearly wrote to tell you, but
I thought it might be presumptuous.

16:05.745 --> 16:09.425
Well, I'm pleased to see you back.
That's a relief.

16:09.465 --> 16:13.625
I thought I must have earned a black mark, making
you take me up to the house that night.

16:13.665 --> 16:16.945
Hello, Miss Bunting.
Lady Rose. Well done.

16:16.985 --> 16:21.145
Oh, it's not exactly difficult - giving out prizes.
I think we get thanked too much.

16:21.185 --> 16:23.025
But that's the custom, isn't it?

16:23.065 --> 16:25.625
We ought to head off, if we're to be
back before the gong.

16:25.665 --> 16:29.105
The Rule of the Gong. It sounds like
life in a religious order!

16:30.425 --> 16:32.425
Goodbye.

16:32.945 --> 16:35.145
I'll see you again.
I hope so.

16:41.585 --> 16:43.545
Spratt...

16:43.585 --> 16:46.665
Offer Dr Clarkson some cake.
Then you may go.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.345
Thank you.

16:56.025 --> 16:58.865
I'm afraid serving me is a bit
beneath his dignity.

16:58.905 --> 17:03.345
Even Spratt cannot always
live for pleasure.

17:03.385 --> 17:07.025
how well do you know
Lord Merton?

17:07.065 --> 17:08.865
Erm... I don't, really.

17:08.905 --> 17:10.105
Oh.

17:10.145 --> 17:14.944
Because I thought you might be
amused by how friendly he and Mrs
Crawley have become.

17:15.744 --> 17:19.185
What Mrs Crawley chooses to do with
her private life is her own affair.

17:19.224 --> 17:22.105
Oh, dear. I've annoyed you.

17:22.145 --> 17:24.145
No, no, no, I'm not annoyed...

17:24.865 --> 17:27.865
..although I am surprised to learn
that she entertains notions

17:27.905 --> 17:30.465
of passing her time at drawing-room
receptions

17:30.505 --> 17:32.625
and taking carriage rides in the
park.

17:32.665 --> 17:37.145
Well, no-one takes carriage rides in
the park any more.

17:37.185 --> 17:39.505
That's quite gone.

17:39.545 --> 17:41.585
I wouldn't know.

17:41.625 --> 17:45.305
You ought to meet Lord Merton
properly.

17:45.345 --> 17:48.625
Come to luncheon on Saturday.

17:48.665 --> 17:50.705
Mrs Crawley will be here
and so will he.

17:50.745 --> 17:53.465
Well, that's quite an honour,
Lady Grantham. Are you sure?

17:53.505 --> 17:58.025
Oh, it'll be fun. I'm hoping to
persuade dear Lady Shackleton

17:58.065 --> 18:00.065
to be one of our number.

18:04.185 --> 18:09.025
Mama's gone to bed. She wanted an
early night. I might go up too.

18:09.065 --> 18:11.065
Come and sit here for a minute.

18:16.065 --> 18:18.705
It doesn't really bother you they
want Carson, does it?

18:18.745 --> 18:20.745
They'd be lucky to get him.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.665
Even so, it makes you think.

18:23.705 --> 18:26.825
Would a village delegation have
arrived in my grandfather's day

18:26.865 --> 18:29.705
to ask his butler to head an appeal?

18:29.745 --> 18:33.505
We're not living in your
grandfather's day. No, we are not.

18:33.545 --> 18:37.705
So, they don't want me at the school
and they don't want me for the memorial.

18:37.745 --> 18:39.745
Well, I want you.

18:40.225 --> 18:42.905
I think you, Tom and I make a pretty
good team.

18:46.305 --> 18:49.505
By the way, I've been looking into
crop rotation and grain sales -

18:49.545 --> 18:52.345
And not every father hears that from
his daughter.

18:56.945 --> 18:58.945
Mr Barrow...

19:00.105 --> 19:02.025
I'm tired of waiting, Miss Baxter.

19:02.065 --> 19:04.065
I'm tired of being bullied.

19:07.705 --> 19:11.585
I got you this job and you knew what
I wanted in return.

19:12.465 --> 19:14.465
So don't complain about it now.

19:20.505 --> 19:22.505
Thank you, Madge. Good night.

19:36.025 --> 19:39.425
Did you know Dicky Merton was in hot
pursuit of Isobel?

19:39.465 --> 19:41.985
Mama says she's desperate to throw
him off.

19:42.025 --> 19:44.385
I wonder.
What do you mean?

19:44.425 --> 19:48.945
I don't believe your mother would enjoy the
transformation of Isobel into Lady Merton,

19:48.985 --> 19:52.865
complete with a living husband, a proper
house and a solid position in the county.

19:52.905 --> 19:54.825
That would not suit Mama at all.

19:54.865 --> 19:59.065
Oh, don't be ridiculous. She'd be
thrilled, if that was what Isobel wanted.

20:03.945 --> 20:08.145
Daisy, whatever are you doing up at this
hour? I thought you'd gone to bed long ago.

20:08.185 --> 20:10.545
I just wanted to look at these.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.585
What is it?

20:12.705 --> 20:14.705
You can tell me.

20:15.065 --> 20:19.105
Arithmetic Part 1?
Cost Accounting? What is this?

20:19.145 --> 20:20.985
I was rubbish at numbers at school.

20:21.025 --> 20:23.825
Well, all the best people were
rubbish at numbers at school.

20:23.865 --> 20:28.665
But I don't know anything.
You talk about my working at
Mr Mason's farm, but how?

20:28.705 --> 20:31.305
I couldn't balance the books if my
life depended on it.

20:31.345 --> 20:35.465
Why do you need to? Because I want
to be grown up, Mrs Patmore.

20:35.505 --> 20:38.185
I want responsibility.
I want to be an adult.

20:38.225 --> 20:41.545
I can't just stand here, following
orders, for the rest of my life.

20:41.585 --> 20:42.985
Well, I do see that.

20:43.025 --> 20:45.785
The trouble is, I'm too stupid to
make out one solitary word.

20:45.825 --> 20:48.585
You're not stupid, Daisy.
Far from it.

20:48.625 --> 20:52.305
Then why can't I understand what's
written? Why can't I follow it?

20:53.345 --> 20:55.065
Because...

20:55.105 --> 20:57.385
Because I'm a pig-ignorant idiot.

20:57.425 --> 20:59.425
Good night, Mrs Patmore.

21:33.305 --> 21:35.145
Is this your secret lair?

21:35.185 --> 21:37.505
It's not very secret,
but this is where I work.

21:37.545 --> 21:40.745
And where you can hide away from the
rest of us?

21:42.345 --> 21:45.105
Why do you never ask that
Miss Bunting up to the house?

21:45.145 --> 21:46.945
Maybe I will. One day.

21:46.985 --> 21:50.465
You live there too, you know.
I'm not sure where I live.

21:50.505 --> 21:52.585
I feel sometimes I'm hanging in
mid-air.

21:52.625 --> 21:55.545
Well, you mustn't think we don't
want you to have your own life.

21:55.585 --> 21:57.865
I don't think that of Mary or Edith
or you.

21:57.905 --> 22:00.105
But it would be hard for Lord and
Lady Grantham.

22:00.145 --> 22:03.225
They'd have to get used to it.
Easier said than done.

22:03.265 --> 22:05.265
I'd better get on.

22:11.225 --> 22:13.705
So, I have your permission to
accept?

22:13.745 --> 22:16.465
You don't need it.
It has nothing to do with your work.

22:16.505 --> 22:19.665
No, but I wouldn't want to think it
was disagreeable for you.

22:19.705 --> 22:21.905
We'd be delighted, Carson.

22:21.945 --> 22:25.225
You'll be able to steer it through
the perils of village politics.

22:25.265 --> 22:29.185
But traditionally, I feel it should
have been you, m'lord.

22:29.225 --> 22:31.225
Maybe this will be a new tradition.

22:35.425 --> 22:39.105
I know you hate not to be wanted,
but you're on so many committees.

22:39.145 --> 22:42.065
What do you mean,
I hate not being wanted?

22:49.505 --> 22:52.825
You think I'm taking too much
of an interest in Marigold.

22:52.865 --> 22:55.305
It's Margie.
She thinks I'm there too often.

22:55.345 --> 22:57.985
Because you've got a crush on me.

22:58.025 --> 23:00.505
Well, that's better than the real
reason...

23:04.145 --> 23:07.225
The real reason is a good reason to
love a child, m'lady.

23:08.465 --> 23:10.545
Mothers should love their children.

23:12.425 --> 23:15.625
How long have you known?
Since you asked me to take her in.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.905
But you're quite safe.

23:18.945 --> 23:21.945
It's not my place to judge you, and I
wouldn't, anyway.

23:23.185 --> 23:25.145
But I should control my feelings?

23:25.185 --> 23:27.985
I could say yes, but I don't believe
it's realistic.

23:28.025 --> 23:30.025
I don't believe you could.

23:30.465 --> 23:32.465
Then what are you saying?

23:33.065 --> 23:37.065
We need a way for you to live the
truth, without telling the truth.

23:43.070 --> 23:45.370
The die is cast. I've accepted.

23:45.372 --> 23:47.292
His Lordship told me to take it.

23:47.332 --> 23:49.852
There you are, then.
But he was sad.

23:49.892 --> 23:53.012
Not with me, but maybe because
things are changing.

23:53.052 --> 23:56.652
Well, they are,
whether we're sad about it or not.

23:58.852 --> 24:01.252
I hope you're right about
Lord Gillingham.

24:01.292 --> 24:03.932
What would I have felt if I'd
inherited a family with you?

24:03.972 --> 24:05.892
You'd have loved them, I hope.
I would,

24:05.932 --> 24:11.052
but I can't deny I'd prefer one of my
own. You'd feel the same.

24:11.092 --> 24:14.452
Well, they do say a mother's love is
the strongest love there is.

24:14.492 --> 24:17.292
But that's all in God's hands.
There's nothing we can do.

24:17.332 --> 24:21.772
I can think of one thing. Mr Bates,
that sort of talk is beneath you.

24:21.812 --> 24:23.812
I stand corrected.

24:25.812 --> 24:29.252
I'll have it out of you. Fancy a
breath of air before the gong?

24:29.292 --> 24:31.292
Thank you, Mr Molesley.

24:32.732 --> 24:36.012
What's the matter with you? You've
not said a word all afternoon.

24:36.052 --> 24:39.532
I went to the village and telephoned
her, to reason with her,

24:39.572 --> 24:41.572
and I think it were a mistake.

24:41.612 --> 24:43.612
It was never going to put her off.

24:43.652 --> 24:45.652
Exactly.

24:45.692 --> 24:48.692
The trouble is, she hates getting
older,

24:48.732 --> 24:50.572
and I think that's at the bottom of
it.

24:50.612 --> 24:54.172
Still, it's pathetic for a lady to
be pining over a footman.

24:54.212 --> 24:56.012
Excuse me!

24:56.052 --> 24:58.052
I think it shows very good taste.

25:00.172 --> 25:03.892
My dear Lady Shackleton, how kind.
And you're on your way somewhere?

25:03.932 --> 25:06.932
I am and I can't stay.
I'm dining with Philip,

25:06.972 --> 25:09.612
and his wife sulks all night if
you're a minute late.

25:09.652 --> 25:13.732
You should write a book:
Daughters-In-Law And How To Survive Them.

25:13.772 --> 25:16.652
I like yours.
Yes, Cora does very well,

25:16.692 --> 25:19.892
even if one cannot always rely on
her instincts.

25:19.932 --> 25:22.292
I'd exchange her for mine in a trice.

25:22.332 --> 25:26.372
Tell me: how well do you know
Lord Merton?

25:26.412 --> 25:30.772
Oh, you know. We've seen each other
at parties for 40 years.

25:30.812 --> 25:35.292
I worry that he's finding things
difficult since his wife died.

25:35.332 --> 25:37.772
You're a widow.
You know what he's going through.

25:37.812 --> 25:40.732
I suppose so, but I never saw them
as very devoted.

25:40.772 --> 25:43.772
I should have thought he was glad to
be rid of her. I would be.

25:43.812 --> 25:46.852
Then his sons are quite difficult.

25:46.892 --> 25:48.852
I know what that's like.

25:48.892 --> 25:54.212
Could you come to luncheon on
Saturday? Help me cheer him up?

25:54.252 --> 25:55.972
Well, I'd love to.
Oh!

25:56.012 --> 25:59.012
Of course, a single peer with a good
estate won't be lonely long,

25:59.052 --> 26:01.052
if he doesn't want to be.

26:01.092 --> 26:03.452
You sound like Mrs Bennett!

26:06.132 --> 26:09.652
But what's he on about? He thinks
I know something about Mr Bates.

26:09.692 --> 26:11.852
And do you?
Maybe.

26:11.892 --> 26:14.492
Mr Bates may have done something he
wouldn't want known.

26:14.532 --> 26:16.332
Do you mean a crime or...?

26:16.372 --> 26:20.012
I'm not sure. I know he took a
journey, which I think he'd deny.

26:20.052 --> 26:22.132
Look, I don't want to know any
more...

26:24.252 --> 26:26.412
..but a pound to a penny,

26:26.452 --> 26:29.092
Mr Barrow thinks he can use it
against Mr Bates.

26:30.492 --> 26:33.692
Report him to Her Ladyship.
She'd soon put a stop to it.

26:33.732 --> 26:35.732
I can't.

26:36.892 --> 26:38.892
It's complicated, but I can't.

26:41.532 --> 26:43.652
What is it?

26:43.692 --> 26:47.612
What's what? You're doing something
funny with your head.

26:47.652 --> 26:49.892
Sort of... tilting it.

26:49.932 --> 26:53.292
I'm not, am I?
How do you think I look?

26:53.332 --> 26:55.572
Why? Have you got a rash?

26:56.492 --> 26:58.292
No, I've not got a rash.

26:58.332 --> 27:01.012
That's all right, then.
No, what I meant was...

27:04.372 --> 27:06.772
How old would you say I am?

27:06.812 --> 27:08.932
I don't know. Maybe... 52?

27:10.532 --> 27:13.372
Oh.
Why? How old are you?

27:14.012 --> 27:16.012
51.

27:17.652 --> 27:19.852
I've just had the strangest
telephone call.

27:19.892 --> 27:22.332
Oh?
Do you remember Lady Anstruther?

27:22.372 --> 27:24.612
You mean Jock Anstruther's widow?
That's it.

27:24.652 --> 27:27.572
Her sister's Lady Renton and
her brother's Harry Mountevans.

27:27.612 --> 27:31.012
I do remember her. Good-looking and
half Jock's age, and rather silly.

27:31.052 --> 27:34.612
Well, silly or not, she's just rung
up and asked herself for tea. Oh.

27:34.652 --> 27:37.452
Do people think we're a public house
on the Great North Road?

27:37.492 --> 27:39.452
It certainly seems like it.

27:39.492 --> 27:43.012
She's driving through the village on
Saturday and would love to see us.

27:43.052 --> 27:45.732
What did you say?
Well, it's only tea.

27:45.772 --> 27:48.132
Are we doing anything for your
anniversary?

27:48.172 --> 27:50.772
What had you in mind?
Well, now that Tony's staying,

27:50.812 --> 27:53.892
I thought we could invite some
people, make an evening of it.

27:53.932 --> 27:56.172
Well, you girls ask some friends.

27:56.212 --> 27:59.492
I'd like a young party for once,
instead of all those old duffers.

27:59.532 --> 28:01.132
Hello.

28:01.172 --> 28:03.292
Oh, Mary, I've got an idea.

28:07.652 --> 28:11.292
I think it's sharp of Daisy to want
to learn to manage figures.

28:11.332 --> 28:13.492
I'm afraid I agree with Mrs Patmore.

28:13.532 --> 28:15.852
Why does she need to? She's a cook.

28:15.892 --> 28:17.772
Cooks have to balance their budget.

28:17.812 --> 28:21.132
She can learn enough for that
without being an expert in algebra.

28:21.172 --> 28:22.892
She may not always be a cook.

28:22.932 --> 28:25.692
Possibly not, but she won't be
Archimedes, either.

28:25.732 --> 28:27.972
Sorry, but I don't think we should
encourage it.

28:30.372 --> 28:33.252
I'm going up. I want to read a bit
before I turn out the light.

28:33.292 --> 28:35.332
Oh, well done with your studies,
Daisy.

28:35.372 --> 28:37.972
It's good to have more than one
string to your bow.

28:38.012 --> 28:41.732
It's even better if you don't have
the brain of a kipper. Good night.

28:42.132 --> 28:45.732
See? What did I tell you? She's lost
her confidence because of it.

28:45.772 --> 28:48.772
And no mathematical skill
is worth that.

28:51.332 --> 28:54.132
Why must Lady Anstruther choose
Saturday, of all days?

28:54.172 --> 28:55.932
Ought we to invite her to
the dinner?

28:55.972 --> 28:58.092
Isn't she staying somewhere else?

28:58.132 --> 29:01.252
Tell me tomorrow who's coming, of
your pals. Keep the numbers even.

29:01.292 --> 29:04.772
Well, Rose wants to invite a friend
of Tom's. He must feel so outnumbered.

29:04.812 --> 29:08.372
Not that brother, I hope.
Someone local. Rose has met her.

29:08.412 --> 29:10.412
So have I. She's quite respectable.

29:10.452 --> 29:12.452
I think it would be nice.

29:17.372 --> 29:19.492
Looking forward to seeing
Lord Gillingham?

29:19.532 --> 29:22.852
I only saw him in London last week,
so I can remember what he looks like.

29:22.892 --> 29:25.652
But I expect it's difficult to get
time alone in London.

29:25.692 --> 29:27.492
Less difficult than when
I was a girl.

29:27.532 --> 29:30.092
But yes, it'll be good to see him
here.

29:31.372 --> 29:34.812
I haven't made up my mind, if that's
what you're thinking.

29:34.852 --> 29:38.852
I wasn't thinking anything, but I
suppose you'll have to some time.

29:40.332 --> 29:44.452
The older I get, the more I feel we
do these things very oddly.

29:45.092 --> 29:48.412
Even now we must decide whether to
share our lives with someone

29:48.452 --> 29:51.492
without ever spending any real time
with them.

29:51.532 --> 29:54.212
Let alone... you know.

29:56.132 --> 29:58.252
Of course, these days, some women do.

29:58.292 --> 30:00.652
I was talking to Lady Cunard's
daughter last week,

30:00.692 --> 30:02.972
and she was so graphic,
I almost fainted.

30:04.972 --> 30:07.652
But then, what could be more
important?

30:08.332 --> 30:10.972
To make sure that that side of things
is right...

30:11.812 --> 30:14.692
..before we tie ourselves to someone
for ever?

30:14.732 --> 30:17.532
I'm afraid I'm too old-fashioned
for you, m'lady.

30:18.212 --> 30:20.772
I need hardly say you're not to
repeat a word to Bates.

30:20.812 --> 30:22.812
Of course not, m'lady.

30:27.732 --> 30:29.612
What do you make of this?

30:29.652 --> 30:31.572
Blimey. What does that mean?

30:31.612 --> 30:36.172
As you know, Lord Gillingham arrives today,
but there's been no mention of a valet.

30:36.212 --> 30:39.932
There was enough mention of the last
one. Poor Mr Green. A terrible end.

30:39.972 --> 30:42.012
Let's not rake over that now.

30:42.052 --> 30:46.092
As I say, His Lordship may have a valet,
but these days we can't be sure, so...

30:46.132 --> 30:47.812
Yes, Mr Carson?

30:47.852 --> 30:51.572
Not you. Mr Bates, would you keep
an eye on him, if necessary?

30:51.612 --> 30:53.332
Certainly, Mr Carson.

30:53.372 --> 30:56.532
Mr Molesley, have you...?
Have I what, Mr Carson?

30:57.532 --> 31:00.652
Er... never mind.

31:06.252 --> 31:07.852
Arms down. Relax.

31:07.892 --> 31:10.772
I'm sorry. They've only just told me
you were waiting.

31:10.812 --> 31:12.812
Oh, I've not been here long.

31:12.852 --> 31:15.532
I wanted to see you after I read
your letter.

31:15.572 --> 31:17.812
It wasn't meant to be confusing.

31:17.852 --> 31:19.852
No. But why won't you come?

31:19.892 --> 31:24.212
Because I don't want to be part of
some sort of a... prank.

31:24.252 --> 31:26.172
What prank?

31:26.212 --> 31:29.452
I may not have been presented at
Court, Lady Rose,

31:29.492 --> 31:33.492
but I do know it's usual to be
invited to dinner by the hostess.

31:33.532 --> 31:35.852
And shouldn't Mr Branson have played
a part in it?

31:35.892 --> 31:40.132
Lady Grantham asked us to invite some
younger guests to liven up the evening,

31:40.172 --> 31:43.852
so Mary and I thought it would be nice
for Tom to have a friend there. That's all.

31:43.892 --> 31:46.932
I'm right, then? He doesn't know.

31:46.972 --> 31:51.012
No, it would be a surprise for him,
but a nice surprise.

31:51.052 --> 31:53.412
And Lady Grantham is aware of this?

31:53.452 --> 31:55.852
Completely. She wants you to come.

31:58.132 --> 32:01.972
I could have managed Lord Gillingham.
No need to burden Mr Bates with him.

32:02.012 --> 32:05.052
I think Mr Carson forgets that
I'm a valet, too.

32:05.092 --> 32:08.772
I know, and it seems a bit ironic
for Mr Bates to dress him.

32:08.812 --> 32:12.052
Why is it ironic?
I don't know why I said that.

32:12.092 --> 32:14.092
Why did you say it, Miss Baxter?

32:16.252 --> 32:18.012
Er... it was rubbish. Nonsense.

32:18.052 --> 32:20.652
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm late.

32:31.492 --> 32:35.732
Oh, how nice. I wanted to call on
you, but I didn't like to be a bother.

32:35.772 --> 32:39.012
I've been quite busy lately, helping
with the out-patient clinic.

32:39.052 --> 32:41.572
Dr Clarkson.
Oh. Lady Grantham.

32:41.612 --> 32:44.572
May I present Dr Clarkson?
I think you know Lord Merton.

32:44.612 --> 32:47.132
I think we have met, yes.

32:47.172 --> 32:50.052
We were talking about your clinic.
Oh, you mustn't bore him.

32:50.092 --> 32:52.972
As a matter of fact, I'd be
interested to - The Lady Shackleton.

32:53.012 --> 32:55.172
Oh, my dear, how prompt you are.

32:55.212 --> 32:57.892
Your daughter-in-law has trained you
well.

32:57.932 --> 33:00.052
Now, you remember Lord Merton?

33:00.092 --> 33:02.372
Of course. How are you?

33:02.412 --> 33:04.332
And how's that lovely garden of
yours?

33:04.372 --> 33:08.612
Oh, still lovely. Largely because
I have the same lovely gardener.

33:08.652 --> 33:11.492
I don't think we've met since dear
Lady Merton's funeral.

33:11.532 --> 33:14.012
I do hope things are sorting
themselves out.

33:15.012 --> 33:19.092
You've gone to a lot of trouble.
Mmm. I like to help where I can.

33:21.212 --> 33:23.372
Oh, Spratt. Shall we go in?

33:25.252 --> 33:27.492
Lord Gillingham.
Ah, here he is.

33:27.532 --> 33:31.092
Tony, welcome.
Lovely to see you all.

33:31.132 --> 33:33.772
I'm afraid you've missed luncheon.
I ate on the train.

33:33.812 --> 33:36.332
A cup of coffee, then?
That would be perfect.

33:37.692 --> 33:39.972
Carson, I must congratulate you.

33:40.012 --> 33:43.332
They're building a memorial in the
village, and Carson is the Chairman.

33:43.372 --> 33:47.772
I like the idea of these things.
To give people a solid focus for
their grief and gratitude.

33:47.812 --> 33:52.212
I agree, My Lord. I hope
His Lordship's happy about it.

33:52.252 --> 33:53.892
My being Chairman, I mean.

33:53.932 --> 33:56.972
He is. Or, at any rate, he will be.

33:57.012 --> 33:59.772
So, how are the famous pigs doing?
Pretty well.

33:59.812 --> 34:01.892
They're earning their keep and more.

34:01.932 --> 34:05.612
I'm going out this afternoon, to get
some rabbits for Mrs Patmore. Come with me.

34:05.652 --> 34:08.132
I'll find you a gun and you can see
what we've been up to.

34:08.172 --> 34:11.732
I'll come too, although I warn you -
I'm not very good at picking up.

34:11.772 --> 34:14.292
Well, if I'm shooting,
you won't have to.

34:14.331 --> 34:16.331
That I do not believe.

34:22.252 --> 34:25.652
Could you spare me for an hour?
I think everything's under control.

34:25.692 --> 34:29.931
I just want to run down to the post
office. I won't be long.

34:31.252 --> 34:34.692
So, will you be travelling north in
August for the grouse?

34:34.732 --> 34:38.052
You talk as if my sole concern is
the sporting year, Dr Clarkson.

34:38.092 --> 34:41.172
The truth is, these days, I hold a
book more often than a 12-bore.

34:41.212 --> 34:45.612
You must miss it.
Not particularly. Thank you. Er...

34:45.652 --> 34:48.732
As a matter of fact, he's more
interested in medicine than sport.

34:48.772 --> 34:50.612
I find that hard to believe.

34:50.652 --> 34:53.331
You sound a little prejudiced.
Not at all.

34:53.371 --> 34:56.772
He seems a nice enough example of
the type, I grant you.

34:56.812 --> 34:58.812
Er...

34:59.372 --> 35:02.972
But, as you say yourself, we're not
members of that tribe, you and I.

35:03.012 --> 35:04.612
Spratt...

35:04.652 --> 35:06.972
I think Dr Clarkson would like
some coffee.

35:07.572 --> 35:09.452
And don't be such a snob.

35:09.492 --> 35:12.452
I'm determined to get you over to
Sheriff Hutton.

35:12.492 --> 35:15.972
The children are in the main house
now. I've been banished to a cottage.

35:16.012 --> 35:18.012
Did you move before Hubert died?
No.

35:18.052 --> 35:21.412
To be honest, I didn't want to go at
all, but I've got used to it.

35:21.452 --> 35:24.932
Apart from anything else, I've never
been warm before!

35:33.172 --> 35:35.172
Morning.

35:52.292 --> 35:56.052
So, why did you talk about Mr Bates
and Lord Gillingham's valet?

35:56.092 --> 35:58.092
What's the connection? Tell me.

35:59.132 --> 36:01.732
There's no point trying to find
Mr Molesley...

36:04.132 --> 36:06.132
..because he can't help you now.

36:10.532 --> 36:13.052
If that's how you want to play it,

36:13.092 --> 36:15.572
I'll give you until upstairs dinner
has finished,

36:15.612 --> 36:20.532
after which I will ask to speak to Her Ladyship
and I will tell her your story.

36:20.572 --> 36:22.572
Do you hear what I'm saying?

36:24.292 --> 36:26.372
I can't tell you what I don't know.

36:26.412 --> 36:28.412
But you know something.

36:29.932 --> 36:32.852
And I think it links Mr Bates to the
dead valet.

36:47.525 --> 36:49.705
I'm impressed by what I've seen.

36:49.730 --> 36:51.770
Tom's a good partner,
so I'm lucky.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.450
I'm the lucky one.

36:54.490 --> 36:58.650
Tom, what about your American plans?
Oh, I don't know. Nothing's fixed.

36:58.690 --> 37:02.370
But never fear. Mary is more than
ready to manage without me.

37:05.370 --> 37:07.370
That's your man.

37:10.690 --> 37:14.730
So, you're not frightened of being
left on your own to control your Papa?

37:14.770 --> 37:18.930
I understand him better now,
and I think he'd say the same of me.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.850
So he's not fighting all change,
then?

37:20.890 --> 37:23.890
No, but he likes proper research.

37:23.930 --> 37:26.690
You see, I want to improve
how we sell our grain.

37:26.730 --> 37:29.370
If I make a good case for it,
he'll agree.

37:29.410 --> 37:31.370
How positive you are.

37:31.410 --> 37:34.250
I've decided to live in the present
and not spend my life

37:34.290 --> 37:37.850
regretting the past or dreading the
future.

37:37.890 --> 37:40.170
I shall try to follow your example.

37:40.210 --> 37:42.330
Do you dread the future?

37:42.370 --> 37:44.370
Only if I have to live it
without you.

37:46.490 --> 37:48.810
Tony, I do love you, you know.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.570
In my cold and unfeeling way.

37:51.610 --> 37:54.530
Then why not say yes?

37:54.570 --> 37:57.610
I don't want to get it wrong.

37:57.650 --> 38:01.530
I'd like to marry again.
I've come that far.

38:01.570 --> 38:05.690
But I intend to be as happy with my
second husband as I was with my first.

38:05.730 --> 38:08.210
It's bound to be a risk on some
level.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.570
You have to take a chance.

38:11.810 --> 38:14.770
The stable clock's fast.
We ought to get back.

38:15.850 --> 38:19.450
By the way, Bates will look after you,
if you haven't brought a man of your own.

38:19.490 --> 38:22.890
Oh, that's rather a luxury for me
these days. I have no valet now.

38:22.930 --> 38:26.930
Our butler takes care of me at home,
but when I travel I usually fend for myself.

38:26.970 --> 38:30.810
Do you mind?
It makes things simpler.

38:30.850 --> 38:33.170
I'd love to make our lives simpler.

38:34.290 --> 38:36.290
Hm.

38:38.930 --> 38:43.210
It's a nightmare when guests are a
nuisance and I feel so guilty,

38:43.250 --> 38:46.250
but I wasn't sure we were even going
to make it down the drive.

38:46.290 --> 38:49.410
But what happened, exactly?
Well, there was this terrible noise.

38:49.450 --> 38:51.490
A sort of rattle, rattle, bang,
bang.

38:51.530 --> 38:54.330
And then the engine just seemed to
lose its power.

38:54.370 --> 38:57.650
We'll get Tom to take a look at it.
Oh, how kind.

38:57.690 --> 39:01.370
But I think my chauffeur, Weaver,
seems to have it in hand.

39:01.410 --> 39:03.290
Could I just use your telephone

39:03.330 --> 39:05.890
and tell my hosts I won't be able to
get to them tonight?

39:05.930 --> 39:09.170
But what will you do? Oh, we passed
a public house in the village,

39:09.210 --> 39:11.570
and I asked Weaver to see if they
had any rooms.

39:11.610 --> 39:14.890
You can't possibly stay at the pub.
Why not? I'm tougher than I look.

39:14.930 --> 39:18.370
You must stay here. We have people
coming to dinner, so it'll be easy.

39:18.410 --> 39:20.650
Oh, yes, it's perfect.
Oh, that's sweet.

39:20.690 --> 39:24.330
Molesley,
you look very Latin all of a sudden.

39:24.370 --> 39:26.290
Do you have Italian blood?

39:26.330 --> 39:30.130
No, m'lord. Not that I'm aware.
Or Spanish? Or Irish?

39:34.330 --> 39:38.370
James... please tell Mrs Hughes that
Lady Anstruther will be staying.

39:38.410 --> 39:41.370
If she could prepare
Princess Amelia.

39:41.410 --> 39:43.410
Very good, Your Ladyship.

39:52.810 --> 39:57.770
Go now. Tell her everything.
You don't know what you're asking.

39:57.810 --> 40:02.610
I may not know your story, but I do know
it'll be worse if Mr Barrow tells her first.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.650
Yes. You're right.

40:06.370 --> 40:08.370
Thank you.

40:18.210 --> 40:20.570
Why is she here?
They don't know her, do they?

40:20.610 --> 40:24.370
Well, if they do, she never told me.
What are you going to say to her?

40:24.410 --> 40:28.410
Who says I'll get the chance to say
anything? Go on. Have it out.

40:28.450 --> 40:31.570
She's playing with you
like a cat with a vole.

40:31.610 --> 40:36.130
James... did you know about
Lady Anstruther's visit?

40:36.170 --> 40:39.890
No, Mr Carson. Why should I?
Didn't you work for her one time?

40:39.930 --> 40:42.250
I'm sure I've got a reference
from her somewhere.

40:42.290 --> 40:44.330
But that was quite a while back,
wasn't it?

40:44.370 --> 40:47.370
Well, she's made extra work for
everyone.

40:47.410 --> 40:49.410
That's all I know.

40:53.050 --> 40:56.530
What do you mean, you need to tell
me something before Barrow does?

40:56.570 --> 41:00.570
Mr Barrow wants to tell you about
something in my past, m'lady.

41:00.610 --> 41:03.770
I've a secret, you see.
A bad secret.

41:03.810 --> 41:07.370
I don't understand. What secret?
How does he know it?

41:07.410 --> 41:09.690
I was a friend of his sister's
when we were young.

41:09.730 --> 41:14.210
But if he knew something wrong about you,
why would he put you forward for the job?

41:15.410 --> 41:17.410
I think you had better tell me.

41:18.050 --> 41:19.650
Very well.

41:19.690 --> 41:22.850
A few years ago, I worked in London,
as a lady's maid

41:22.890 --> 41:27.730
for a Mrs Benton who... lived with her
husband in Ovington Square.

41:29.330 --> 41:31.530
Go on.

41:31.570 --> 41:35.450
I was there for about six months,
and then I...

41:36.850 --> 41:39.210
And then you what?

41:39.250 --> 41:41.250
I...

41:42.650 --> 41:45.890
..took some jewellery belonging to
the mistress.

41:45.930 --> 41:49.810
A necklace, a couple of bracelets,
some rings.

41:50.530 --> 41:52.530
You took them?

41:53.570 --> 41:57.410
I tried to make it look like a
burglary, but it didn't work.

41:57.450 --> 41:59.450
And Mrs Benton reported the theft?

42:01.290 --> 42:03.890
They took me up a few hours later.

42:03.930 --> 42:05.930
My fingerprints were everywhere.

42:06.730 --> 42:08.730
And to make it worse...

42:12.930 --> 42:15.250
..I never gave the stolen things
back.

42:15.290 --> 42:17.290
Why not?

42:18.490 --> 42:20.610
Because, by then, I didn't have them.

42:20.650 --> 42:22.570
What happened?

42:22.610 --> 42:25.210
I went to prison. For three years.

42:32.370 --> 42:34.770
Thank you, Baxter.

42:34.810 --> 42:36.810
Very good, m'lady.

42:37.210 --> 42:39.730
What do you make of our
mysterious visitor?

42:39.770 --> 42:43.450
Tom said he went to look at the car
and could find nothing wrong.

42:43.490 --> 42:46.130
Maybe the chauffeur mended it.
Maybe.

42:46.170 --> 42:48.170
We ought to go down.

42:53.090 --> 42:55.090
Will there be anything else?

42:55.290 --> 42:58.090
I don't think so. Thank you.
It's been quite a treat.

42:58.130 --> 43:00.730
You don't travel with a valet
these days, m'lord?

43:00.770 --> 43:04.210
No, no. When Green died,
I never replaced him.

43:05.090 --> 43:09.330
We were all shocked by the death of
Mr Green so soon after he was here.

43:09.370 --> 43:11.370
Yes. Of course.

43:12.010 --> 43:14.490
Had he been with you long?
Not very long, no.

43:16.210 --> 43:18.210
Right. Thank you.

43:33.810 --> 43:36.210
Well...?
I told her.

43:36.770 --> 43:41.290
Now, I'm not asking what you said, but I
want to be sure that you held nothing back.

43:43.010 --> 43:44.730
Good.

43:44.770 --> 43:47.490
How was she?
I don't know.

43:47.530 --> 43:49.930
Shocked, but not unkind.

43:49.970 --> 43:52.250
Then His Lordship walked in,
so that was that.

43:52.290 --> 43:54.770
The point is, if she allows you to
stay,

43:54.810 --> 43:57.530
you're here in a truthful way and
not in a lie.

43:57.570 --> 43:59.570
And if I'm not allowed to stay?

44:00.330 --> 44:02.570
Well, you're still not caught
in a lie.

44:02.610 --> 44:04.610
That's what matters.

44:04.770 --> 44:07.290
I will tell you the story one day.

44:07.330 --> 44:12.610
But I'm loath to... forfeit your
good opinion, and I know I would.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.650
No, you won't.

44:15.250 --> 44:17.770
You don't trust me yet,
but I'm on your side.

44:17.810 --> 44:21.170
Mr Molesley, I need that up in the
servery. Now.

44:21.210 --> 44:23.210
Yes, Mr Carson.

44:29.850 --> 44:33.090
Jimmy... I ought to scold you.

44:33.730 --> 44:37.610
Why did you ignore my letters?
You're a very naughty boy.

44:37.650 --> 44:41.610
Show Her Ladyship where to find the
drawing room, James.

44:41.650 --> 44:43.530
Of course.

44:43.570 --> 44:45.570
Will you come this way, m'lady?

44:53.890 --> 44:57.450
I feel so guilty, pushing into
a family celebration.

44:57.490 --> 45:01.530
You'd be an ornament at any
gathering. Oh, how nice. Thank you.

45:02.250 --> 45:05.130
No cocktails?
I thought everyone had them now.

45:05.170 --> 45:08.650
Not at Downton. Our butler tried
them once and he hasn't recovered.

45:10.570 --> 45:12.650
Oh, look at your parents.

45:12.690 --> 45:15.290
34 years. I'd never manage it.

45:15.330 --> 45:18.490
That's the advantage of an older
husband. One gets an early release!

45:18.530 --> 45:20.530
Miss Sarah Bunting.

45:21.530 --> 45:23.570
What on earth is she doing here?

45:23.610 --> 45:26.050
I asked her. Cora said I could.

45:28.290 --> 45:31.810
Have I done something wrong?
She's the teacher I told you about.

45:31.850 --> 45:35.650
After her behaviour while we were in London,
I don't think she's a suitable guest.

45:35.690 --> 45:40.130
Let me introduce you.
Kitty Colthurst. Sarah Bunting.
Miss Bunting's a teacher.

45:40.170 --> 45:42.930
Oh, golly! How clever.
What do you teach?

45:42.970 --> 45:45.730
The usual things. Writing.
Mathematics.

45:45.770 --> 45:50.370
Crikey. Writing's almost beyond me,
and I wouldn't know where to start
with mathematics!

45:50.410 --> 45:54.610
Well, then, you must marry someone
rich enough to ensure you never need to.

45:57.210 --> 45:59.930
Oh...
What are you doing here?

45:59.970 --> 46:04.770
Lady Rose invited me.
Rose, did you ask Lord Grantham?

46:04.810 --> 46:06.810
Wasn't Cora's permission enough?

46:09.650 --> 46:12.290
How are you?
I'm exhausted.

46:12.330 --> 46:14.530
Two parties in one day
is too much for me.

46:14.570 --> 46:19.090
Was your luncheon a success?
You must ask Cousin Isobel.

46:19.810 --> 46:22.490
We've cast the net wide tonight.

46:22.530 --> 46:25.090
Can't Tom have a friend of his own?
Oh, of course.

46:25.130 --> 46:29.810
But it's time he decided whether he
is fish, flesh, fowl or good red herring.

46:29.850 --> 46:32.970
Well, I think it's nice to see
an intelligent face here.

46:34.850 --> 46:38.410
Miss Bunting has been shocking us
with her support for the Prime Minister.

46:38.450 --> 46:42.530
But surely, most of the country must support
him, or he wouldn't be Prime Minister.

46:42.570 --> 46:46.210
There is an unanswerable logic in
that. Oh, quite.

46:46.250 --> 46:49.770
There's an alliance that does not
bode well.

46:49.810 --> 46:53.090
I quite agree with you.
Aren't you being very snobbish?

46:53.130 --> 46:57.690
We're being realistic - something
your generation has such trouble with.

47:02.890 --> 47:07.650
Her chauffeur says there's nothing
wrong with the car that he could
find, so there's a mystery.

47:07.690 --> 47:10.530
See? She's here to see you.
I don't know what she wants.

47:10.570 --> 47:13.690
Don't you? Because I do.
It's embarrassing.

47:13.730 --> 47:16.210
I have a feeling it could get a lot
more embarrassing

47:16.250 --> 47:18.450
if you don't find a way to keep her
quiet.

47:19.570 --> 47:21.650
Take that.

47:21.690 --> 47:24.810
Marriage is a lottery, as we are
often told,

47:24.850 --> 47:27.570
but I am a man who has drawn
a winning ticket.

47:27.610 --> 47:29.530
I have been awarded a bumper prize:

47:29.570 --> 47:34.010
beauty, brains, a heart,
a conscience, all in one.

47:34.050 --> 47:39.050
I give you my Cora, the best
companion in the world.

47:39.090 --> 47:41.090
Mama.
Lady Grantham.

47:43.210 --> 47:46.410
What a tribute.
Indeed. If only it were true!

47:47.410 --> 47:49.450
What's happened to Molesley's hair?

47:50.490 --> 47:55.210
Carson, Lady Mary tells me that
you're to lead the Memorial Committee.

47:55.250 --> 47:58.290
That is so, madam. Yes.
You'll drive it splendidly.

47:58.330 --> 48:01.490
Rose, is that friend of yours
terribly clever?

48:01.530 --> 48:04.450
She's Tom's friend, not mine,
but I think so. Yes.

48:04.490 --> 48:06.570
She certainly thought I was
terribly stupid.

48:06.610 --> 48:08.930
Well, let's not shoot her down
for that.

48:20.370 --> 48:21.730
No, thank you.

48:21.770 --> 48:24.410
Do you know that footman?
Yes, he used to work for me.

48:24.450 --> 48:26.690
It's always nice to see
a friendly face.

48:26.730 --> 48:29.290
Especially a friendly, pretty face.

48:29.330 --> 48:32.610
I'm not convinced these memorials
are a good idea,

48:32.650 --> 48:34.890
but I suppose that's a different
issue.

48:34.930 --> 48:38.010
Why not? Won't they give people
a focus for their sorrow?

48:38.050 --> 48:40.330
And a reminder of the sacrifices
that were made.

48:40.370 --> 48:43.530
If it were a memorial service,
then I might agree,

48:43.570 --> 48:45.450
but a stone edifice on the green,

48:45.490 --> 48:49.970
to remind us for ever of death and a
pointless war - what's the good of that?

48:50.010 --> 48:51.970
To say nothing of the waste of
money.

48:52.010 --> 48:54.610
Forgive me, but you're talking
nonsense.

48:54.650 --> 48:57.130
Forgive me, but I suppose
she's allowed an opinion.

48:57.170 --> 49:00.650
Not that opinion. Not in this house.
I think what she means is -

49:00.690 --> 49:04.090
She is here as your friend,
so of course you must defend her.

49:04.130 --> 49:05.810
But was the war worth fighting?

49:05.850 --> 49:08.490
What did it achieve, beyond the
Russian Revolution?

49:08.530 --> 49:12.650
Millions of men dead and no more
'justice' than there was before.

49:12.690 --> 49:14.890
You are wrong, both of you.

49:14.930 --> 49:17.650
But we must strive to keep things
light.

49:17.690 --> 49:20.130
It's a pity they didn't want you
on their Committee.

49:20.170 --> 49:22.770
You put up a stout defence of
their intentions.

49:28.570 --> 49:31.210
They do want His Lordship on the
Committee.

49:31.250 --> 49:32.810
Forgive me, My Lord.

49:32.850 --> 49:35.970
I'd have told you later, but they
held a meeting this afternoon,

49:36.010 --> 49:38.290
and they would like you
as their patron.

49:38.330 --> 49:41.170
Oh, how nice. I dare say that was
always their plan.

49:41.210 --> 49:43.210
I dare say it was, Your Ladyship.

49:43.250 --> 49:45.250
I should be glad to accept.

49:45.290 --> 49:47.290
Now, if you can all put
your swords away,

49:47.330 --> 49:50.810
perhaps we can finish our dinner
in a civilised manner.

49:50.850 --> 49:55.650
But I admire it, when young people
stand up for their principles.

49:55.690 --> 49:57.690
Principles are like prayers.

49:57.730 --> 50:01.850
Noble, of course,
but awkward at a party.

50:07.681 --> 50:10.681
James, did my eyes deceive me,

50:10.721 --> 50:14.041
or did Lady Anstruther pass you
a note during dinner?

50:14.681 --> 50:17.441
Yes, Mr Carson.
Can I see it?

50:18.521 --> 50:22.961
He's thrown it away.
She just wanted to remind him that
he once worked for her, Mr Carson.

50:23.001 --> 50:24.601
Even so, it's most irregular.

50:24.641 --> 50:27.801
But it wasn't his fault, was it? He
could hardly slap her hand away.

50:27.841 --> 50:30.641
Get that up to the drawing room.

50:32.641 --> 50:36.321
I gather from Mr Molesley that you
gave the good news to His Lordship.

50:36.361 --> 50:39.601
Ah, that is correct.
How did you get them to agree?

50:39.641 --> 50:42.201
I said I wouldn't serve if they
didn't make him Patron.

50:42.241 --> 50:43.881
And have you told him that?

50:43.921 --> 50:46.561
He doesn't need to know everything,
Mrs Hughes.

50:46.601 --> 50:48.841
Nobody has to know everything.

50:51.721 --> 50:53.921
I've enjoyed myself.

50:53.961 --> 50:57.601
Both gatherings were interesting,
in their different ways.

50:57.641 --> 51:00.561
You get on well with Lord Merton.
I know that.

51:00.601 --> 51:04.641
I do, but Cousin Violet had other
plans for him at luncheon.

51:04.681 --> 51:06.121
Where is Granny?

51:06.161 --> 51:09.201
She said goodbye to your mother, but
she wanted to slip away.

51:09.241 --> 51:12.041
The day of parties had taken
its toll.

51:12.081 --> 51:14.961
Before I go, I want to meet the
staff downstairs.

51:15.001 --> 51:17.361
You don't think you've made enough
of a statement?

51:17.401 --> 51:20.881
What about you?
I know. I got a bit carried away.

51:20.921 --> 51:22.841
I thought you were splendid.
Cheer up.

51:22.881 --> 51:25.241
You're putting quite a dampener on
the evening.

51:25.281 --> 51:28.921
Really? I thought only imbeciles
were happy all the time.

51:29.881 --> 51:32.841
Here she comes.
The Boudicca of the North Riding.

51:32.881 --> 51:34.801
Thank you so much for having me.

51:34.841 --> 51:37.601
It was a pleasure.
Wasn't it, Robert?

51:38.641 --> 51:41.441
I want to thank your cook before I
go, and the other servants.

51:41.481 --> 51:45.321
I'm afraid they'll be sitting down to
supper, and we don't like to disturb them.

51:45.361 --> 51:48.721
I won't be more than a minute.
Of course you must go down.

51:48.761 --> 51:50.761
They'd be delighted.

51:52.321 --> 51:54.801
I assume you heard the way she spoke
to me at dinner.

51:54.841 --> 51:58.801
Of course, but how does it help to
answer rudeness with rudeness?

52:02.201 --> 52:05.001
Is everything satisfactory, m'lord?
No, it is not.

52:05.041 --> 52:09.721
And can you please keep Molesley in the
kitchens until his hair stops turning blue?

52:16.201 --> 52:17.921
What are you doing?

52:17.961 --> 52:20.961
Setting out the breakfast trays for
Her Ladyship and Lady Mary.

52:21.001 --> 52:22.961
Not Lady Rose and Lady Edith?

52:23.001 --> 52:27.041
Unmarried young ladies eat breakfast
in the dining room. Oh, do they?

52:27.801 --> 52:29.841
Thank you again, and I'm glad to
meet you.

52:29.881 --> 52:32.081
I felt I had to put faces to
his stories.

52:32.121 --> 52:34.841
What stories are those?
Oh, that's a dangerous question.

52:34.881 --> 52:36.561
We may not like the answer!

52:36.601 --> 52:40.521
Do you work in the school? I teach mathematics,
handwriting and spelling, mainly.

52:40.561 --> 52:42.881
You must be so clever.
I wouldn't say that.

52:42.921 --> 52:45.321
Come and meet the others.
Goodbye.

52:46.041 --> 52:47.801
That's such a different path.
It is,

52:47.841 --> 52:51.121
but it doesn't mean it's better than
the one you've chosen.

52:52.721 --> 52:55.641
Your Ladyship, might I have a word?

52:59.161 --> 53:01.641
I'm very sorry to say it,

53:01.681 --> 53:05.561
but I've learned something that
makes me feel both responsible and guilty.

53:05.601 --> 53:07.601
Would this have to do with Baxter?

53:08.441 --> 53:12.681
Because, if it concerns her criminal
record, then I know all about it.

53:12.721 --> 53:14.601
Do you, m'lady?

53:14.641 --> 53:17.641
What I don't understand is why you
placed a convicted felon

53:17.681 --> 53:19.721
in my household, in my bedroom,

53:19.761 --> 53:22.241
when you knew every detail
of her past.

53:22.281 --> 53:24.841
I wanted her to have another chance.

53:24.881 --> 53:28.241
Don't you think that should have
been my decision, in my own house?

53:28.281 --> 53:30.041
Yes, m'lady. Perhaps it should.

53:30.081 --> 53:35.841
So... why tell me now? Because, if you have
been using your knowledge against her,

53:35.881 --> 53:38.001
I'll have to consider your future
here.

53:38.041 --> 53:40.041
Indeed, whether you have one at all.

53:41.041 --> 53:43.721
I just thought I'd been wrong and
you ought to know.

53:43.761 --> 53:45.761
I see. Well, now I do.

53:46.201 --> 53:48.201
Good night.

53:56.161 --> 53:58.281
You think you're so clever,
don't you?

54:02.521 --> 54:04.521
Has Miss Bunting gone?

54:06.281 --> 54:10.081
Yes. She got a lift down to the
village with Mrs Crawley.

54:10.121 --> 54:12.121
That was nice of her.

54:17.081 --> 54:20.801
I wanted to apologise, for arguing
with you at dinner.

54:20.841 --> 54:23.121
You were nothing, compared to her.

54:23.161 --> 54:25.081
She has her views - that's true.

54:25.121 --> 54:27.881
But I must confess, they remind me
of how I used to feel.

54:27.921 --> 54:31.961
Is that what you want, Tom?
To go back, when you've come so far?

54:32.001 --> 54:34.201
I've come a long way from who I was.
That's true.

54:34.241 --> 54:36.241
And is it a bad thing?

54:41.841 --> 54:45.161
- We're not lovers, you know.
- What?

54:45.201 --> 54:47.001
That time when you were in London,

54:47.041 --> 54:50.121
you thought that we'd got up to
something. We never did.

54:51.641 --> 54:55.001
As Sybil's father, this is not an
easy conversation for me,

54:55.041 --> 54:57.961
but if I was wrong, then I am sorry.

54:59.441 --> 55:02.881
The truth is, I worry less about that

55:02.921 --> 55:07.041
than if Miss Bunting is taking you
back into the role of rebel and hater.

55:08.161 --> 55:10.001
I'm not a hater.

55:10.041 --> 55:12.041
I don't hate anyone.

55:13.561 --> 55:15.561
Least of all you.

55:16.561 --> 55:21.281
Well, that is a more cheerful note to
say 'good night' on.

55:26.601 --> 55:28.601
Isis!

55:29.001 --> 55:31.201
But why didn't you give the jewels
back?

55:32.761 --> 55:35.201
You say you didn't have them by
then, but who did?

55:35.241 --> 55:37.081
More than that,
why did you do it at all?

55:37.121 --> 55:40.521
You don't strike me as being greedy.
You were working. You were earning.

55:40.561 --> 55:42.681
Did you dislike Mrs Benton?
Was she harsh?

55:42.721 --> 55:46.681
No, m'lady. She was a kind woman.
That only makes it more mysterious.

55:46.721 --> 55:50.881
I won't start concocting excuses for
myself. There are no excuses.

55:50.921 --> 55:54.241
There may not be excuses, but there
is missing information.

55:57.201 --> 56:00.321
You've shocked me, Baxter.
Profoundly. I can't deny it.

56:01.041 --> 56:06.441
You have every reason, m'lady. So, am
I to take it that I am dismissed?

56:08.601 --> 56:11.201
Your work is excellent, and I have
never sacked a servant

56:11.241 --> 56:13.441
that gave me no cause for complaint.

56:15.081 --> 56:18.441
Have I your word you will not commit
this crime again?

56:18.481 --> 56:22.521
I will never commit any crime again.
Not as long as I live.

56:25.481 --> 56:27.281
You may stay until I make
a decision.

56:27.321 --> 56:29.801
I cannot tell you how long
that will be,

56:29.841 --> 56:32.641
and I do not at all promise
I'll keep you on.

56:32.681 --> 56:34.241
No.

56:34.281 --> 56:36.281
Very well.

56:37.561 --> 56:39.881
I think we should leave it there
for now.

56:49.841 --> 56:53.761
I hope we don't have to see too much
more of Miss Bunting.

56:53.801 --> 56:56.001
Lady Rose told Madge she liked her.

56:56.041 --> 56:58.241
And she seemed nice when she came
downstairs.

56:58.281 --> 57:02.401
Maybe, but she makes Papa say things
he doesn't mean,

57:02.441 --> 57:05.041
and I know he hates himself for it
afterwards.

57:06.921 --> 57:08.921
Mr Molesley...

57:09.761 --> 57:13.481
I do not know why you have treated
your hair with a special substance -

57:13.521 --> 57:15.201
Well, I -
But I can only say

57:15.241 --> 57:18.401
that the effect on your appearance
is not what you would have it.

57:18.441 --> 57:21.111
Take steps, Mr Molesley. Take steps.

57:21.139 --> 57:24.419
You will remain below stairs
until you do.

58:35.613 --> 58:39.893
Well... So, Lady Mary's not quite so
ladylike, after all.

58:40.492 --> 58:42.492
Me next.

58:49.053 --> 58:52.293
You think I'm mad, don't you?
It doesn't matter what I think.

58:52.332 --> 58:55.732
Maybe she just wants to talk.
Maybe I'm the missing Tsarevich!

58:55.772 --> 58:59.172
The trouble is, I can't resist it.
Not when it's offered on a plate.

58:59.212 --> 59:01.012
Well, you're not alone there.

59:01.052 --> 59:03.012
Now, if you can stay with her
until three,

59:03.052 --> 59:05.572
you'll get back to your room
without being noticed.

59:05.613 --> 59:10.493
I'll watch until you're in there. If you hear
me speak, just keep walking past her door.

59:11.693 --> 59:13.733
Thanks, Mr Barrow.

59:13.773 --> 59:15.773
Thomas. I mean it.

59:17.653 --> 59:19.733
You're a real pal.

59:19.772 --> 59:21.772
Well, I try to be.

59:33.732 --> 59:36.932
But, Tony... you really shouldn't be
in here.

59:36.972 --> 59:40.092
Of course I shouldn't.
Why are you, then?

59:40.133 --> 59:43.053
Because you're in love with me.
Am I?

59:43.092 --> 59:47.172
Well, you said so yourself. You were
torn between me and Charles Blake,

59:47.212 --> 59:49.972
but I think you've decided
and I'm the winner.

59:50.892 --> 59:53.012
Well, thank goodness that's settled.

59:53.732 --> 59:56.892
The trouble is, you want to be sure.

59:58.012 --> 01:00:01.812
Well, surer than the customs
of well-bred courtship will allow.

01:00:01.852 --> 01:00:04.652
Go on.
I want you to come away.

01:00:04.692 --> 01:00:07.332
Just for a week, maybe less.

01:00:07.372 --> 01:00:12.772
But on our own, and we'll spend
the days... talking.

01:00:14.532 --> 01:00:16.452
And the nights?

01:00:16.492 --> 01:00:18.492
We'll spend those together, too.

01:00:20.372 --> 01:00:22.372
I want us to be lovers, Mary.

01:00:23.332 --> 01:00:28.012
I want us to know everything there
is to know about each other.

01:00:29.132 --> 01:00:31.732
And then after that, I believe you
will be sure.

01:00:32.812 --> 01:00:35.332
If Papa was here,
he'd hit you on the nose.

01:00:35.372 --> 01:00:37.292
I'm trying to convince you
to marry me.

01:00:37.332 --> 01:00:39.652
That's not the normal purpose of
seducers.

01:00:39.692 --> 01:00:41.692
I don't think he'd see it that way.

01:00:42.652 --> 01:00:45.132
What do you say to my scandalous
suggestion?

01:00:48.452 --> 01:00:50.452
No-one must ever find out.

01:01:10.012 --> 01:01:11.772
Fire!
What?

01:01:11.812 --> 01:01:14.052
Fire!
Oh, my God. George!

01:01:28.452 --> 01:01:30.452
I've got Sybbie and George.

01:01:33.412 --> 01:01:35.932
Thank God! Mary, you take them.

01:01:35.972 --> 01:01:38.292
Tony, go with her. Tom, come with me.

01:01:38.332 --> 01:01:40.612
You know where the sand buckets
are kept.

01:01:42.012 --> 01:01:44.332
Good god! Barrow, is she all right?

01:01:44.372 --> 01:01:47.132
I think so, m'lord.
We must get her outside.

01:01:48.492 --> 01:01:50.492
Quickly, Tom!

01:01:52.412 --> 01:01:53.892
Tom, get the hose!

01:01:53.932 --> 01:01:56.612
Rose, wake Mrs Hughes and the maids.
She'll do the rest.

01:01:56.652 --> 01:02:00.012
We must alert the firemen. Who knows
where to find Drewe's number?

01:02:00.052 --> 01:02:01.732
I do.
And save the dog!

01:02:01.772 --> 01:02:05.292
Barrow, hurry up! Get her away from
the smoke. I'll check the bedrooms.

01:02:05.332 --> 01:02:07.972
Let me check the rooms, m'lord.
Now, man!

01:02:12.412 --> 01:02:14.412
Fire!

01:02:19.212 --> 01:02:20.772
There's a fire.

01:02:20.812 --> 01:02:23.172
Well, I'll see you both downstairs.

01:02:24.892 --> 01:02:27.452
Everybody outside. There's a fire.

01:02:27.492 --> 01:02:30.892
James? James? Where's James?

01:02:30.932 --> 01:02:33.012
Peter, look in the bathroom
for James.

01:02:33.052 --> 01:02:35.052
Mr Molesley, hurry along, please.

01:02:42.172 --> 01:02:45.132
Here, Tom!

01:02:49.452 --> 01:02:51.452
Mrs Patmore, do be careful.

01:02:52.052 --> 01:02:54.692
Don't worry. Don't worry.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:04.212
We'll take over now, m'lord.

01:03:10.532 --> 01:03:12.932
Thank you.

01:03:15.532 --> 01:03:18.292
How are you feeling?
All right, I think.

01:03:18.332 --> 01:03:20.132
But I've been terribly stupid.

01:03:20.172 --> 01:03:22.172
Don't worry about that now.

01:03:22.892 --> 01:03:26.052
Lord Grantham, I may sneak away
before breakfast.

01:03:26.092 --> 01:03:28.252
Would you forgive me?
I have quite a way to go.

01:03:28.292 --> 01:03:30.172
Perhaps that would be a good idea.

01:03:30.212 --> 01:03:32.212
M'lord...

01:03:33.972 --> 01:03:37.372
Barrow, we have to thank you -

01:03:37.412 --> 01:03:41.572
for raising the alarm and rescuing
Lady Edith so bravely.

01:03:42.092 --> 01:03:43.892
What were you doing on the gallery?

01:03:43.932 --> 01:03:47.492
Oh, just keeping an eye on things.
Well, thank goodness you were!

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:51.172
I was angry with you before and
I was tempted to take it further,

01:03:51.212 --> 01:03:55.172
but I accept that you have earned
our goodwill by your actions tonight.

01:03:55.212 --> 01:03:57.212
Thank you, m'lady.

01:04:03.252 --> 01:04:05.532
What's going on? What's happening?

01:04:05.572 --> 01:04:07.332
Don't worry. It's almost over.

01:04:07.372 --> 01:04:10.372
Mr Bates wanted to come, to see you
were safe. We were so worried.

01:04:10.412 --> 01:04:14.892
We're fine. Lady Edith chose to set
fire to her room, but we're fine.

01:04:14.932 --> 01:04:17.012
I'll see if there's anything
I can do.

01:04:17.372 --> 01:04:20.052
He's calmed down now, but he was in
a real state.

01:04:21.332 --> 01:04:24.012
He does get so worked up about
things.

01:04:24.052 --> 01:04:26.052
I can imagine.

01:04:30.172 --> 01:04:32.252
I don't wish to be harsh,
but I have a feeling

01:04:32.292 --> 01:04:34.692
James would be better
employed elsewhere.

01:04:34.732 --> 01:04:37.212
Oh?
Please don't ask me why I think so,

01:04:37.252 --> 01:04:41.252
but I suspect his ambitions rather outstrip
what a career as a footman will yield.

01:04:41.292 --> 01:04:43.772
As Your Lordship wishes.
Give him a good reference.

01:04:43.812 --> 01:04:45.572
We don't want it talked about.

01:04:45.612 --> 01:04:47.572
Understood, m'lord.

01:04:47.612 --> 01:04:50.812
All clear now, m'lord. No real
damage beyond Lady Edith's bedroom.

01:04:50.852 --> 01:04:52.852
Well, that's something.

01:04:54.652 --> 01:04:56.772
We can all go back inside!

01:04:56.812 --> 01:04:58.812
The excitement is over.

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:06.052
Might Lady Edith sleep in His
Lordship's dressing room tonight, m'lady?

01:05:06.092 --> 01:05:07.612
Since the bed's made up.

01:05:07.652 --> 01:05:08.892
Of course.

01:05:08.932 --> 01:05:11.652
I'm just going to thank the firemen,
Papa. Right.

01:05:18.492 --> 01:05:21.772
Have you had any ideas?
Yes, and it's a simple one.

01:05:21.812 --> 01:05:25.012
You are going to take a great
interest in little Marigold, m'lady.

01:05:25.052 --> 01:05:28.012
Of course. We just need to introduce
the notion carefully,

01:05:28.052 --> 01:05:30.132
so everyone accepts and believes it.

01:05:33.252 --> 01:05:35.972
You're to sleep in His Lordship's
dressing room tonight,

01:05:36.012 --> 01:05:38.412
and we'll see what can be saved
tomorrow.

01:05:38.452 --> 01:05:40.452
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

01:05:57.392 --> 01:06:00.172
You have heard the voice of
His Majesty King George V.

01:06:00.258 --> 01:06:01.578
I'm sorry if I've hurt you.

01:06:01.618 --> 01:06:04.778
And the mist is clearing around the
lithe figure of Tony Gillingham?

01:06:04.818 --> 01:06:07.498
You do know she's a thief?
There must be more to it.

01:06:07.538 --> 01:06:09.738
Mrs Crawley has been distracted
lately,

01:06:09.778 --> 01:06:12.138

her skirts.

01:06:12.178 --> 01:06:15.258

I didn't shoot the Imperial Family.

01:06:15.378 --> 01:06:17.404
Is this what they call a lively
exchange of views?
