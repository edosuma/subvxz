WEBVTT

01:10.447 --> 01:11.448
Tata.

01:25.462 --> 01:28.381
Tata. Where is everyone?

01:44.397 --> 01:45.565
Pablo.

01:49.235 --> 01:51.488
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

01:52.489 --> 01:53.865
I'm all right.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.494
Go back to bed.

03:52.984 --> 03:55.028
<i>Do you know why they brought you there?</i>

03:56.613 --> 03:59.574
<i>He said they were going to send a message
to other kids.</i>

04:00.742 --> 04:03.536
<i>Who is "he"? Do you remember his name?</i>

04:04.704 --> 04:06.289
<i>Colonel Carrillo.</i>

04:08.416 --> 04:10.293
<i>I know this is difficult...</i>

04:11.085 --> 04:13.838
<i>but tell me what happened
when they brought you there.</i>

04:16.716 --> 04:18.259
<i>They killed my friend.</i>

04:18.343 --> 04:20.553
<i>- I'm very sorry...</i>
- This is a farce.

04:20.637 --> 04:24.182
- Escobar trained this kid very well.
- I'll speak with Carrillo.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.809
Whether he did or didn't do it
is beside the point.

04:26.893 --> 04:29.395
Colombia is tired of Escobar.

04:29.479 --> 04:32.023
Besides, Valeria Velez?

04:32.106 --> 04:34.442
My God, she has no credibility
in this country.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.945
I need to know if Carrillo
killed that boy.

04:37.028 --> 04:43.201
If we say that she's doing this
to discredit Carrillo, they'll believe us.

04:43.284 --> 04:47.789
But if the press finds out
that you spoke to Carrillo about this...

04:47.872 --> 04:49.707
They'll assume it's the truth.

04:50.416 --> 04:51.793
Exactly.

04:59.801 --> 05:01.761
What do you propose?

05:01.844 --> 05:04.514
That we don't play Escobar's game.

05:04.597 --> 05:08.017
And that we leave things as they are...
for the time being.

05:11.437 --> 05:14.983
I think we're going to need
more than an interview.

05:15.066 --> 05:19.112
- No. No violence.
- That's not what I mean. I suggest--

05:19.195 --> 05:21.531
Now we need to have the people
on our side.

05:21.614 --> 05:27.203
Yes, of course. It's just the president
has denied it ever happened,

05:27.286 --> 05:30.206
and the American news
hasn't even picked up the story.

05:30.289 --> 05:31.791
Of course.

05:31.874 --> 05:36.754
If David were the son
of an important politician, but...

05:36.838 --> 05:42.385
the men of always aren't interested
in the children of never.

05:43.136 --> 05:45.054
- Of course.
- Right?

05:58.067 --> 06:01.821
I'm writing a letter to the editors
of the most important newspapers

06:01.904 --> 06:06.409
to tell them how that boy came to me,
scared for his life.

06:06.492 --> 06:11.122
The world has to know what sort of monster
that son of a bitch Carrillo is.

06:12.707 --> 06:14.500
Don Pablo, that's excellent.

06:16.753 --> 06:18.046
Give me that pencil.

06:40.109 --> 06:41.109
Burn everything.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.084
Don't move! Felix, take this one.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.503
Don't even think about it.
Up against the wall.

07:05.802 --> 07:07.929
We don't know yet. We're working on it.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.143
Are we having a good time?

08:45.026 --> 08:46.444
That's a very pretty girl.

08:47.153 --> 08:49.530
But you're paying for those lines,
asshole.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.663
Clean this shit up!

08:59.081 --> 09:02.376
Who taught you to live like this?
Not from our mother!

09:06.589 --> 09:07.924
And wake up, asshole!

09:08.007 --> 09:09.592
And you, Edgar!

09:10.509 --> 09:15.223
Call Pablo and ask him
where he wants us to take his half.

09:15.306 --> 09:17.266
All right. All right.

09:17.850 --> 09:20.728
What are you doing calling
from that phone? Use the pay phone!

09:20.853 --> 09:24.065
- Relax, brother.
- Edgar...

09:24.148 --> 09:25.524
What?

09:25.608 --> 09:28.527
- Have you been calling from this phone?
- No.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.113
Son of a--

09:58.432 --> 09:59.934
Move it, faggot!

10:25.251 --> 10:26.627
Hey there.

11:56.634 --> 11:58.094
Dad?

11:58.886 --> 12:01.806
- Quickly, inside!
- Friend.

12:02.515 --> 12:04.308
Calm down, friend.

12:08.396 --> 12:09.897
Everything is all right.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.109
I can't believe it. You son of a bitch.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.236
It's carbon rock.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.906
The cocaine is dissolved and mixed in.

13:00.990 --> 13:05.870
Did you think I bought chemistry labs
because I enjoyed the class in school?

13:05.953 --> 13:07.955
You're going to put chemists
out of business.

13:08.038 --> 13:11.083
I'm more interested
in putting Pablo out of business.

13:12.460 --> 13:15.337
Now's the time to move in on Miami.

13:17.465 --> 13:20.176
It won't be hard for us
to take that business.

13:21.719 --> 13:25.222
- But don't you think it's too early?
- Pablo's in hiding.

13:25.306 --> 13:29.143
The Search Bloc is killing his men.
Soon they'll catch him,

13:29.226 --> 13:32.563
and I want us to be in an advantageous
position when that happens.

13:33.272 --> 13:34.690
Could you take care of that?

13:36.025 --> 13:37.318
Yes, of course.

13:39.028 --> 13:41.614
But don't make it too obvious.

13:42.281 --> 13:47.578
I don't want Judy Moncada asking fucking
questions and negotiating for a piece.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.206
Then you should call Pablo

13:50.289 --> 13:55.711
and tell him we'd be happy
to turn Judy over to him.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.672
We'll dump her in the same ditch
we'll be dumping him in.

14:14.897 --> 14:15.897
Guys.

14:18.651 --> 14:21.570
The Search Bloc took another Moncada lab.

14:21.654 --> 14:24.281
The sons of bitches killed
three of the Prisco brothers.

14:24.365 --> 14:25.866
Ricardo got away.

14:25.950 --> 14:27.785
- When was this?
- Last night.

14:27.868 --> 14:32.831
It's that son of a bitch, Don Berna.
He's telling the cops everything.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.417
Let's hide out on the coast.
I'll convince Don Pablo.

14:35.501 --> 14:38.087
Since when do we hide, brother?

14:39.964 --> 14:41.840
Let's trust the boss.

14:41.924 --> 14:45.344
Yes. Don Pablo always finds a solution.

14:52.268 --> 14:53.519
- Hello?
<i>- Get me Don Pablo.</i>

14:53.602 --> 14:55.104
- Who is this?
<i>- Fernando Duque.</i>

14:55.187 --> 14:56.480
- Fernando.
<i>- Get him now.</i>

14:56.564 --> 14:59.942
Yes, sir, right away. Limón, please.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.076
Boss?

15:09.994 --> 15:11.912
Your lawyer, Mr. Duque.

15:14.957 --> 15:18.168
- How many were published?
<i>- Don Pablo,</i>

15:18.252 --> 15:21.880
we sent all of them to the newspapers.

15:23.591 --> 15:27.761
How many of my letters were published,
Fernando?

15:27.845 --> 15:30.222
Yes. None.

15:30.306 --> 15:32.808
<i>They're very well written.</i>

15:32.891 --> 15:39.273
It's not about how well written they were,
Fernando. It was the fucking truth!

16:16.852 --> 16:19.730
This is why we saw ourselves forced

16:19.813 --> 16:22.691
to take up arms and defend ourselves...

17:09.697 --> 17:11.281
Move it, you sons of bitches!

17:42.855 --> 17:44.898
All right. Very good.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.145
Guys.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.815
Ms. Judy.

19:53.777 --> 19:58.699
All right, now... I would like
to know the reason for this meeting.

19:58.782 --> 20:02.536
- You don't see this every day.
- Look, Pacho, it's simple.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.663
We need to get rid of Pablo Escobar.

20:05.706 --> 20:09.918
We know you all joined forces against him.

20:10.002 --> 20:13.922
And we want to know if it's possible
for my brother and I to join the cause.

20:14.006 --> 20:18.594
Why? What do you want out of this?

20:18.677 --> 20:21.722
- We want what's best for Colombia.
- That's it?

20:21.805 --> 20:25.183
Pablo Escobar,
aside from being a terrorist,

20:25.267 --> 20:30.647
is also allied with the guerrillas,
who he has helped on many occasions.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.776
Putting an end to Pablo Escobar
is a patriotic act.

20:34.860 --> 20:38.822
Imagine, Pacho, your financial resources

20:38.906 --> 20:44.328
combined with all of the information
you have on Pablo Escobar's operation

20:44.411 --> 20:49.207
- with our military experience--
- We'd make one hell of a death squad.

20:49.291 --> 20:55.339
No, Mrs. Moncada. No.
A death squad? No. An army.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.716
And when this army gets to Medellín,

20:57.799 --> 21:00.677
Pablo Escobar's death
won't be a matter of months.

21:00.761 --> 21:03.138
It'll be a matter of weeks.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.682
What do you say, Pacho?

21:05.766 --> 21:09.227
Can we count on the support
of you and your partners?

21:16.610 --> 21:20.113
All of this sounds interesting.

21:20.197 --> 21:23.158
With all due respect, gentlemen,

21:23.241 --> 21:28.455
our organization already
has a strategy in place, and it's working.

21:28.538 --> 21:31.249
It doesn't seem to me like it's working.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.628
Because, to this day,
Pablo Escobar is still alive.

21:34.753 --> 21:38.340
- That's right.
- At this rate, not for long.

21:44.388 --> 21:47.015
Look, I'll share this conversation
with our partners.

21:47.099 --> 21:50.852
But I think that, for now,
our answer is no.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.107
Excuse me.

22:14.710 --> 22:18.088
- Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.
- How did you find me?

22:18.171 --> 22:20.048
I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.

22:22.718 --> 22:24.469
- And La Quica?
- He's not here.

22:24.553 --> 22:26.722
He's back there, looking for you.

22:28.682 --> 22:33.520
If he finds out that I'm here, he's going
to want to kill me too. Let's talk. Relax.

22:34.896 --> 22:38.525
Because of you,
I'll never be able to go back to Medellín.

22:38.608 --> 22:39.943
- Maritza!
- Because of you,

22:40.027 --> 22:42.904
- my daughter and I have to live in hiding.
- Relax!

22:45.741 --> 22:48.952
I really am sorry,
and I'm here because I want to help you.

22:49.036 --> 22:51.705
Like you helped the girls
you used to drive around in your taxi?

22:51.788 --> 22:54.875
- I had nothing to do with that.
- And why would I believe you?

22:54.958 --> 22:58.045
Because you know me,
and I wouldn't do something like that.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.256
You killed me, Jhon.

23:01.339 --> 23:04.342
You killed me by putting me
in your fucking taxi.

23:04.426 --> 23:08.930
You knew how badly I needed that money
and you took advantage of that.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.600
I really am sorry, Maritza.

23:11.683 --> 23:14.686
Believe me. I think I have an idea
to get us both out of this.

23:14.770 --> 23:15.771
What is it?

23:15.854 --> 23:19.608
We'll give them what they want.
We'll give them Escobar.

23:24.905 --> 23:28.158
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Believe me, Maritza.

23:28.700 --> 23:32.120
I'm the one who drives Escobar.
I know when his <i>sicarios</i> aren't with him.

23:32.204 --> 23:34.956
- You can call the police.
- Maritza, what's going on here?

23:35.957 --> 23:37.834
Mom, go back inside. Go inside.

23:40.962 --> 23:42.798
Doña Liliana.

23:44.049 --> 23:46.051
- I don't trust the police.
- Listen to me.

23:46.134 --> 23:49.596
This is your chance
to get a visa from the Americans,

23:49.679 --> 23:51.723
so you can leave with your daughter.

23:57.938 --> 24:01.108
And you? What do you get out of this?

24:01.191 --> 24:05.070
Working for Escobar isn't what it seems.
They're killing all of his men.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.488
I'm afraid.

24:08.532 --> 24:12.994
I need to get out.
We both need to get out, Maritza.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.875
All right. My turn.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.462
You both look beautiful.

25:09.843 --> 25:14.055
All right, my love, go to your room
so I can talk with your dad, all right?

25:30.864 --> 25:34.034
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

25:37.537 --> 25:39.164
Velasco told me.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.984
There are 20 men out there, Tata.

26:09.027 --> 26:13.323
Yes, Pablo... 20 strangers.

26:15.533 --> 26:16.743
Let's see.

26:18.662 --> 26:19.788
How do you hold it?

26:32.842 --> 26:37.389
What? Are you sure you want to laugh
at your wife while she's holding a gun?

26:38.556 --> 26:40.642
It's not a joke, Pablo.

26:42.394 --> 26:46.064
Those 20 men out there
don't care what happens to us.

26:46.898 --> 26:50.819
When the time comes,
it will just be you and me.

26:53.446 --> 26:56.032
And I will be a part of this, Pablo.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.127
All right.

27:09.921 --> 27:12.966
But I think you need
more practice with that.

27:35.030 --> 27:38.158
- Javi, it's Gabriela.
<i>- What's up?</i>

27:38.241 --> 27:40.744
- It's been a while and I want to see you.
<i>- Now?</i>

27:42.078 --> 27:43.955
I can't right now. I'm working.

27:44.789 --> 27:46.875
Don't be like that.

27:54.716 --> 27:58.636
All right. Give me...
20 minutes, all right?

28:27.457 --> 28:28.500
Hello.

28:30.919 --> 28:32.504
- I've got half an hour.
- Wait.

28:32.587 --> 28:36.591
- Javi...
- Come here. What's wrong?

28:39.928 --> 28:41.054
Hello.

28:41.137 --> 28:43.098
Hello.

28:43.181 --> 28:44.974
She's a friend of a friend.

28:46.226 --> 28:48.269
Maritza, meet Javier.

28:50.355 --> 28:51.439
And...

28:52.941 --> 28:55.819
why are you introducing me
to a friend of a friend?

28:56.694 --> 28:58.655
She's in trouble.

28:59.656 --> 29:01.408
Just hear her out.

29:01.491 --> 29:04.702
Goddammit, Gabby.
You could have told me over the phone, no?

29:04.786 --> 29:06.830
- I knew you wouldn't come.
- Well, I'm leaving.

29:06.913 --> 29:11.626
- Bye!
- No. Wait. It's important.

29:12.627 --> 29:14.003
Please.

29:15.004 --> 29:16.423
Hear her out.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.350
What's your name? Maritza?

29:33.940 --> 29:36.443
What kind of trouble are you in?

29:37.652 --> 29:39.487
Who are you in trouble with?

29:40.572 --> 29:45.243
- La Quica.
- La Quica. You know La Quica?

29:49.122 --> 29:51.332
- He wants to kill me.
- Well...

29:51.416 --> 29:53.668
La Quica wants to kill a lot of people.

29:56.254 --> 29:58.590
Why does he want to kill you?

29:59.591 --> 30:02.594
Because I can tell you
where Pablo Escobar is.

30:11.186 --> 30:12.729
And how are you going to do that?

30:13.688 --> 30:17.108
I know exactly when and where
he'll be tomorrow.

31:08.826 --> 31:13.706
If this is true, Colonel, she can tell us
when Limón and Escobar go somewhere.

31:38.189 --> 31:39.357
Let's go.

31:51.369 --> 31:52.745
Can you explain this?

31:56.416 --> 31:57.875
A subpoena.

31:57.959 --> 32:01.921
You're going to answer the questions
I have regarding La Catedral.

32:02.755 --> 32:05.091
You mean your witch hunt.

32:06.467 --> 32:09.846
Tell me, how did Pablo Escobar
get out of that prison

32:09.929 --> 32:14.475
while being surrounded by 400 soldiers?

32:15.059 --> 32:19.230
How many times do I have to tell you
that I don't know how Escobar escaped?

32:20.106 --> 32:22.567
He must have paid someone off.

32:22.650 --> 32:26.613
I would say that's
almost certainly the case.

32:27.780 --> 32:34.245
This is about transparency, truth, law.

32:34.829 --> 32:39.667
And I sense from your reluctance to speak

32:39.751 --> 32:44.631
that the truth will not be kind to you
or our esteemed president.

32:47.467 --> 32:52.680
Look, sir, what happened that night
was complicated and, yes,

32:52.764 --> 32:56.392
I must confess that we lost control
of the situation, we made mistakes,

32:56.476 --> 32:59.729
but we're talking about a national crisis.

32:59.812 --> 33:06.277
So what? Does that mean
that we should just trust you?

33:07.028 --> 33:12.116
Look, sir... I ask you to please trust me.

33:14.744 --> 33:17.455
All you're doing by making
this investigation public

33:17.538 --> 33:23.169
is destroying the life of a very good
human being. Our president.

33:23.252 --> 33:28.216
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

33:42.730 --> 33:43.564
Hello?

33:43.648 --> 33:45.525
Hello, Maritza. It's me.

33:46.651 --> 33:48.319
I spoke with Peña.

33:48.403 --> 33:49.904
Pay attention.

33:51.072 --> 33:54.450
In one hour, I will take Pablo
to his accountant.

33:55.868 --> 34:00.873
He lives in the south. I need you to give
the Americans the address. Understand?

34:03.042 --> 34:05.169
Are we really going to turn in
Pablo Escobar?

34:06.629 --> 34:10.758
Yes, Maritza.
We're going to do this together.

34:11.718 --> 34:14.178
But I need you to trust me.

34:16.764 --> 34:17.849
Give me the address.

34:17.932 --> 34:19.726
Write it down.

34:21.185 --> 34:25.064
9th street with 98-3. Got it?

34:28.609 --> 34:29.861
Got it.

34:41.998 --> 34:44.751
...my love. Do it again.

34:46.502 --> 34:49.046
I'm sorry, boss.
You'll be late to your appointment.

34:49.130 --> 34:51.174
Thank you, Limón. A kiss.

34:51.257 --> 34:54.010
Come on. Ice cream. Ice cream.
One, two, and...

36:07.959 --> 36:09.544
Everything all right, boss?

36:27.478 --> 36:31.315
9th Street. 98-3.

36:31.399 --> 36:33.568
Okay. Got it.

37:14.692 --> 37:17.653
<i>All right.
Now turn off the satellite phones.</i>

37:50.686 --> 37:54.190
We'll be out in 20 minutes.
So be on alert.

37:54.273 --> 37:55.608
Yes, Colonel.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.945
Attention! We're headed out!

38:27.556 --> 38:29.308
We're on San Juan.

38:34.772 --> 38:39.360
<i>Everything's calm.
Murphy, you're buying the drinks tonight.</i>

38:46.826 --> 38:48.285
Of course, blondie.

38:53.958 --> 38:55.001
It's burning!

39:02.341 --> 39:03.718
Reverse!

39:08.264 --> 39:09.432
It's an ambush!

39:13.894 --> 39:14.729
Sabada!

39:14.812 --> 39:18.232
Carrillo, respond!
Carrillo! Trujillo! Do you copy?

39:23.904 --> 39:25.406
Son of a bitch!

40:25.174 --> 40:26.174
Look at me.

40:30.346 --> 40:32.014
Look at me.

40:43.567 --> 40:48.197
You asked a child to give me this.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.878
You can have it back.

41:09.135 --> 41:14.932
And this... is for my cousin, Gustavo.

41:16.767 --> 41:18.602
Coward.

41:18.686 --> 41:20.187
Son of a bitch.

42:32.635 --> 42:35.554
Don't worry. It's going to heal well.

46:06.682 --> 46:09.309
They're saying that Pablo himself
killed Carrillo.

46:09.393 --> 46:11.353
Next, he'll come after the two of you.

46:13.313 --> 46:16.984
Or me, or you, Pacho.

46:17.067 --> 46:20.070
No, we've got to come up
with another plan.

46:20.154 --> 46:23.449
Another approach.
Another way to achieve our goals.

46:25.242 --> 46:28.704
Pacho, we need to call the Castaños.

46:30.497 --> 46:33.625
Soon we'll know what's in it for them.

47:04.948 --> 47:10.913
Carrillo hasn't been buried yet...
and they're already asking for my head.

47:12.748 --> 47:14.791
They want a scapegoat.

47:16.585 --> 47:18.295
And we have to give them one.

47:27.721 --> 47:31.433
That's why we're going to say that you
were poorly advised by your vice minister.

47:34.645 --> 47:37.856
- We can find another way.
- Let me finish.

47:37.940 --> 47:41.902
We're going to say that I acted alone
and without authorization

47:41.985 --> 47:44.029
when I entered La Catedral.

47:44.780 --> 47:48.909
And that it was I who insisted
that Carrillo return.

47:56.333 --> 47:57.834
I don't accept your resignation.

47:57.918 --> 48:02.422
Now, more than ever, the country
needs you, Eduardo. I need you.

48:02.506 --> 48:05.008
We have to do it, César.

48:06.468 --> 48:11.765
You know it. The attorney general,
the press, the opposition, the citizens,

48:11.848 --> 48:14.810
everyone's looking for someone to blame.
All of them.

48:15.769 --> 48:17.437
And it's not going to be you.

48:23.318 --> 48:29.116
It's been my honor serving you
and the people of Colombia.

48:46.216 --> 48:47.509
Good luck.

49:59.873 --> 50:02.626
Limón told me you have a daughter.

50:05.420 --> 50:06.588
How old?

50:10.300 --> 50:13.303
- Two.
- And what's her name?

50:16.056 --> 50:19.142
- Salome.
- What a beautiful name.

50:26.817 --> 50:30.529
This is the second time
that I've felt indebted to you.

50:34.950 --> 50:40.330
Now, Maritza...
our daughters will be safe.

50:42.290 --> 50:43.583
Thank you.

50:45.585 --> 50:50.424
Know that... you have a friend in me.

51:06.898 --> 51:07.898
What did you do?

51:09.943 --> 51:11.486
I took care of it.

51:12.821 --> 51:14.489
You're safe now.

53:18.488 --> 53:19.990
What now?

53:20.740 --> 53:22.450
What the fuck do you want?

53:23.243 --> 53:24.995
I want to help you.

53:26.955 --> 53:28.164
Oh, yeah?

53:30.375 --> 53:32.460
Come with me and I'll show you.

54:24.846 --> 54:27.057
Make yourself at home.

54:55.251 --> 54:56.836
Agent Peña.

54:57.963 --> 54:59.756
Welcome to Montecasino.
