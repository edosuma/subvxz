WEBVTT

00:01.920 --> 00:02.921
Previously...

00:03.000 --> 00:06.447
I won't set foot
on our shores again without Young Ian.

00:06.760 --> 00:08.330
You cannae take me away from my home!

00:08.400 --> 00:10.400
He was holding the box.
What should we do with him?

00:10.440 --> 00:12.966
Keep him. The Bakra likes young boys.

00:13.040 --> 00:17.204
That box once contained three sapphires,
and now there are only two.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.884
Then mebbe my uncle took the jewel.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.576
You didn't mean
to share that with me, did you'?

00:20.600 --> 00:21.696
'Tis the tea you're drinking.

00:21.720 --> 00:25.361
I've accepted Macivefs invitation
to the governors reception.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.091
Mr Campbell?
And your sister, she's here?

00:28.160 --> 00:29.161
She is.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.971
Wherever did you get
that lovely gemstone?

00:32.040 --> 00:34.361
I need your sister
to do readings for the crowd.

00:34.440 --> 00:35.680
What do the words mean?

00:35.760 --> 00:37.410
A new king will rise in Scotland

00:37.480 --> 00:40.404
upon the death of a child
that is 200 years old.

00:40.480 --> 00:42.369
Captain Leonard is on the premises.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.736
You are charged
with the wilful murder of John Barton.

00:44.760 --> 00:45.761
Find Young Ian!

02:12.760 --> 02:13.966
I was dead.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.484
Everything around me
was a blinding white,

02:18.560 --> 02:22.281
and there was a soft rushing sound,
like the wings of angels.

02:23.880 --> 02:27.248
I felt peaceful. And bodiless,

02:28.040 --> 02:31.362
free of terror, free of rage,

02:32.600 --> 02:34.887
filled with a quiet happiness.

02:55.640 --> 02:56.641
Hurry!

03:07.400 --> 03:08.561
Why are we stopping?

04:11.080 --> 04:12.491
Which way to the slaves' quarters?

04:12.560 --> 04:13.766
Along the path.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.244
Wait for me at the bottom of the road,

04:18.360 --> 04:21.284
and if I'm not back by daybreak,
inquire after me at the main house.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.441
Yes, Mistress.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.247
Claire's been here.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.563
I had hoped Mr Willoughby would be here.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.136
Harm may have befallen him.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.128
He's a clever man.
He'll ken how to avoid harm.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.520
There's naught we can do for him.
We dinna ken this island.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.647
It's from Milady.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.249
Milord has been
arrested by Captain Leonard.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.130
We must make haste to the Artemis, then.
We'll need help.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.283
Non. There's another way.
I must go now. Wait here for me.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.283
Fergus Fraser. I'm yer wife.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.481
I'm coming with you.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.321
Ian?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.001
Ian?

05:22.520 --> 05:23.521
Ian?

05:34.760 --> 05:35.761
Ian?

05:59.600 --> 06:01.011
Through all your blathering,

06:01.440 --> 06:04.011
ye failed to tell me
about yer Auntie Claire.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.366
What has she to do with this?

06:06.840 --> 06:09.207
It was she who
was after the treasure. Why?

06:09.280 --> 06:11.442
Perhaps you cannae hear properly.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.287
'Twas to pay a debt.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.001
Ye're lying.

06:16.280 --> 06:19.250
She wanted the sapphire.
She learned about the prophecy.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.641
I'm tired of yer blathering.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.644
So leave me be,
or get on with it, ye bitch!

06:25.400 --> 06:27.368
I swear, I'll gut you!

06:30.160 --> 06:31.969
Hercules just found someone.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.125
Take him away, quickly.

06:38.800 --> 06:39.801
Let go of me!

06:41.640 --> 06:42.721
Hercules!

06:45.480 --> 06:46.481
Geillis.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.811
Sorry, it's late.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.682
My coachman left me
at the end of the road,

06:51.760 --> 06:54.525
and I got lost trying to find the house.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.324
Ye're welcome any time. We're friends.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.126
I apologise
for my manservant's roughness.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.124
He must have thought you an intruder.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.321
What brings ye here?

07:33.920 --> 07:35.445
Jamie's been arrested.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.051
For what crime?

07:37.760 --> 07:39.842
Someone's accused Jamie of murder.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.650
Of course, he's innocent.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.364
Now they're after me as well.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.131
You must be exhausted.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.401
Come sit.

07:59.760 --> 08:03.162
Shame you couldn't have lost your way
and found Havana instead.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.561
You are quite droll
for a man in irons, Mr Fraser.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.760
We did have difficulties making
our way here, being quite short-handed.

08:08.840 --> 08:09.841
But we're here now.

08:10.360 --> 08:11.805
However, that will not be for long.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.256
Once we have provisioned
and found proper crew,

08:13.280 --> 08:15.169
we will transport you home
to face trial.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.651
Halt there, Lieutenant.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.128
We'll be taking
Mr Fraser into our charge.

08:25.640 --> 08:26.880
By what authority?

08:28.080 --> 08:29.081
Your Excellency,

08:29.960 --> 08:33.089
I must respectfully request that you
return this man to my custody.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.080
He stands accused
of murder and high treason.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.535
A warrant has been
issued for him in Scotland,

08:36.559 --> 08:39.131
and I am duty-bound to ensure
his return there to face trial.

08:40.840 --> 08:41.841
Of course.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.721
May I see the warrant?

08:48.040 --> 08:50.566
I don't have it in my possession,
Your Excellency.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.001
You don't have the warrant?

08:53.080 --> 08:55.208
Then what do you have,
Lieutenant Leonard?

08:56.680 --> 08:57.681
Forgive me...

08:58.680 --> 08:59.681
Captain Leonard.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.850
You must excuse my unfamiliarity

09:01.920 --> 09:05.129
with the somewhat liberal practices
of the naval service,

09:05.200 --> 09:07.851
insofar as conferring rank is concerned.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.843
I'm afraid the army takes a somewhat

09:09.920 --> 09:12.127
more traditional stance
in these matters,

09:12.200 --> 09:15.602
preferring to grant a title of command
only when it has been earned.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.762
Now, as to your request...

09:18.840 --> 09:20.842
If you are unable
to produce the warrant,

09:20.920 --> 09:23.605
then what have you
to support your claim against this man?

09:24.160 --> 09:25.656
Well, surely you must have some evidence

09:25.680 --> 09:27.880
to put forward before
you dispossess him of his freedom?

09:28.880 --> 09:29.881
A member of my crew

09:29.960 --> 09:32.456
encountered this man in Edinburgh
while in the service of the Crown

09:32.480 --> 09:35.370
and can attest to the incriminating
activities he saw there.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.081
I see.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.042
Then I presume your witness
has made an affidavit

09:40.120 --> 09:42.726
and sworn its veracity
before a magistrate.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.685
May I see the affidavit?

09:45.600 --> 09:46.681
Having only just arrived,

09:46.760 --> 09:49.286
- I've not yet had the opportunity...
- Lieutenant... Captain!

09:49.400 --> 09:50.447
Do you mean to say

09:50.520 --> 09:53.888
you have neither warrant nor affidavit
to support your claim?

09:53.960 --> 09:56.088
Surely you do not mean
to arrest a British subject

09:56.160 --> 09:58.561
on nothing more than
the scurrilous gossip of the lower deck?

10:02.480 --> 10:03.686
Your Excellency...

10:04.760 --> 10:07.240
I am satisfied as to both
the validity of the charge

10:07.320 --> 10:09.049
and the identity of this man.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.602
And as a senior
naval officer on the Porpoise,

10:11.680 --> 10:15.401
I am justified under the Articles of War
in my desire to take him into custody.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.606
Indeed. Captain...

10:17.400 --> 10:19.164
Were he captured at sea.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.886
However, your authority
ends at the water's edge,

10:23.960 --> 10:26.406
which is precisely
where my authority begins.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.721
And until such time

10:27.800 --> 10:31.521
as I am satisfied as to
the validity of this alleged warrant,

10:31.600 --> 10:33.250
this man will retain his liberty.

10:33.600 --> 10:37.685
- Your Excellency...
- Thank you, Lieutenant Leonard.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.402
Seems I'm indebted to you yet again

11:01.360 --> 11:02.930
for saving my life.

11:04.160 --> 11:08.643
Seems we've been indebted to each other
so many times I lost count.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.046
Until the next time, then.

11:13.720 --> 11:14.926
Goodbye, John.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.882
Goodbye, Jamie. And...

11:20.040 --> 11:21.041
Good luck.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.081
Then Jamie and I arrived here.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.281
In Jamaica.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.846
That's a braw tale.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.288
But ye seem to have omitted one detail.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.606
Why are you here?

11:47.960 --> 11:49.166
I just told you.

11:53.200 --> 11:57.922
Twenty-five years ago,
you dropped out of the sky into my life,

11:58.160 --> 12:00.367
and now, again,
you appear on my doorstep.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.331
Strange how fate
keeps bringing us together.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.801
I never met another traveller. Only you.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.005
We share a bond...

12:12.640 --> 12:15.007
Something even you and Jamie
can't share.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.640
I suppose we do.

12:19.240 --> 12:22.847
I befriended you, and because of that,
I let my guard down.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.328
I sacrificed all for you,

12:25.400 --> 12:27.926
and still you come into my home
and lie to me.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.809
You've been lying since we met.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.803
I'm not lying to you, Geillis.

12:31.880 --> 12:35.043
I now see it was you
who poisoned Colum's mind.

12:35.560 --> 12:39.326
Ye turned him against Dougal
and against the Rising.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.842
Just didn't know how far
you'd come to stop me.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.524
Stop you from what?

12:44.600 --> 12:47.251
From fighting for a Scot
to sit on the throne.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.363
I've done no such thing.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.606
Charles Stuart had his chance.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.205
He's water under the bridge,

12:55.800 --> 12:57.723
but I'm not talking
about the Bonnie Prince.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.443
I'm talking about the new king.

13:02.880 --> 13:03.881
Geillis...

13:05.320 --> 13:07.288
I have no idea what you're getting at.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.962
I was just as shocked
to see you at the reception...

13:10.040 --> 13:11.769
Don't play the fool with me, Claire.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.766
You knew full well
about the Brahan Seer,

13:14.840 --> 13:17.411
and the sapphires,
and that I was getting close

13:17.480 --> 13:20.529
to freeing my people
from the tyrannical rule of the English,

13:20.600 --> 13:24.241
and returning my homeland
to its former glory, as God meant it!

13:26.480 --> 13:28.289
I think I had better leave.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.209
- Stop her!
- Get your hands off me!

13:33.280 --> 13:35.362
This isn't Cranesmuir, Claire.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.524
There's no one here to defend you,
save the truth.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.204
What is it that you want to hear'?

13:41.400 --> 13:43.562
Why have you been after me
all these years?

13:44.240 --> 13:47.210
I haven't even been in this time
for the last 20 years.

13:47.800 --> 13:48.961
More lies.

13:49.720 --> 13:53.566
Right before Culloden,
I went back to my own time, in 1948.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.248
You'd never leave your beloved Jamie.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.290
Well, I didn't want to.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.525
But he made me leave,
because we knew what would happen.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.007
I don't believe you.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.881
Not even war could part the two of ye.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.241
I was pregnant!

14:15.160 --> 14:16.161
Pregnant?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.729
And ye left your husband?

14:20.320 --> 14:21.446
I had to...

14:22.640 --> 14:24.802
For the safety of my child.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.606
You know how it was after the '45,

14:28.720 --> 14:30.449
the bloodshed, the clearances.

14:31.080 --> 14:34.323
Well, I went back to raise her
in my own time, in Boston.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.736
And then, when she was old enough,

14:35.760 --> 14:38.491
I returned to find Jamie,
but that was a few months ago!

14:38.560 --> 14:41.689
So you're claiming you
travelled through the stones three times

14:41.760 --> 14:42.886
and survived it?

14:44.640 --> 14:46.563
I've read better stories
in Mills & Boon.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.930
You can have her. Do what ye will.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.405
Look, I have proof!

14:51.920 --> 14:52.921
Here.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.206
Look.

14:55.880 --> 14:58.281
This is my daughter.

15:02.120 --> 15:06.250
How could I be in these photos
if I wasn't telling you the truth?

15:15.160 --> 15:16.491
She looks familiar.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.601
What's her name?

15:21.680 --> 15:22.681
Brianna.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.085
You actually met her,

15:26.160 --> 15:29.050
at the university in Invemess in 1968.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.241
Aye.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.607
I did meet her.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.251
She was at the White Roses rally,
and later at the pub.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.206
That was your daughter'?

15:40.280 --> 15:42.931
And we were there the night
that you went through the stones.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.970
That was you shouting my name?

15:45.480 --> 15:48.689
I wanted to tell you about what
would happen at the witch trial.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.645
I tried to warn you.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.046
Then you must have seen...

15:54.120 --> 15:55.281
Your husband.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.081
Yes.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.046
Well, what was left of him.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.330
He was one of my favourites.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.081
Handsome...

16:06.240 --> 16:07.730
Such a lovely cock.

16:09.880 --> 16:13.601
But a sacrifice is required, Claire,
for the sake of the cause.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.684
I never needed a sacrifice
any time I went through.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.320
Then how did you do it?

16:25.920 --> 16:26.921
I don't know.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.806
I think it has

16:36.280 --> 16:38.681
something to do
with who's on the other side,

16:39.560 --> 16:41.130
drawing you to them.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.691
That might be so.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.844
But I'd just as soon have blood.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.689
A girl can't be too careful.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.644
A 200-year-old baby...

16:55.200 --> 16:56.281
Imagine that.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.050
My dear friend, I've acted monstrously.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.484
But you can understand.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.806
Our paths keep crossing
so ominously, and...

17:08.440 --> 17:09.521
Well, it frightens me.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.284
Things haven't been easy for me.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.766
It's hard to distinguish
friend from foe.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.241
But I now see
that we've been brought together

17:19.319 --> 17:22.085
by forces more powerful than ourselves.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.845
I shall retire now.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.008
I'll have a servant
show you to a guest room,

17:34.080 --> 17:35.640
where you can stay as long as you need.

18:21.840 --> 18:22.841
Ian?

18:40.760 --> 18:41.761
Claire!

18:41.840 --> 18:42.841
Christ, how did you...

18:42.920 --> 18:44.410
Fergus got word to John Grey.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.241
Ye all right, Sassenach?

18:46.320 --> 18:49.563
Yes, I'm fine.
Geillis has Young Ian. Come on.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.371
Which way now, Sassenach?

18:57.840 --> 18:59.808
This way, towards the drumming.

21:07.480 --> 21:08.481
Claire!

21:16.720 --> 21:17.721
Jamie!

21:20.360 --> 21:21.521
Willoughby?

21:22.600 --> 21:23.601
Willoughby.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.562
They are with me.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.126
What are you doing here?

21:39.600 --> 21:40.840
I am with Miss Campbell.

21:40.920 --> 21:44.322
These kind people heard of her gifts,
and they asked her to come.

21:48.520 --> 21:49.521
Margaret?

21:52.080 --> 21:54.924
She is the first woman to truly see me,

21:55.840 --> 21:57.524
the man that I am, and...

21:58.600 --> 21:59.965
I see her.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.846
We wish to be together.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.531
After tonight,
we will go to Martinique...

22:09.200 --> 22:10.486
Make a home there.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.401
Have you seen Ian?

22:17.640 --> 22:18.687
I have not.

22:19.240 --> 22:20.890
Well, perhaps Margaret has.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.210
He's with Mrs Abernathy.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.686
Margaret.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.401
Mistress.

22:40.440 --> 22:43.205
I was so pleased to see you
at the governor's reception.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.805
I'm pleased to see you, too.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.523
You seem happier.

22:48.080 --> 22:51.687
Margaret, can you tell us
where Mistress Abernathy may be?

23:00.520 --> 23:01.885
I see you

23:02.200 --> 23:04.965
in an orchard of death...

23:05.360 --> 23:07.328
Sown with blood.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.725
I see...

23:11.040 --> 23:12.041
The rabbit.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.046
Christ.

23:19.080 --> 23:22.721
I see a bird on a windowsill.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.365
It sings to you when you are sorrowful,

23:27.520 --> 23:29.761
but you hear him.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.730
I knew it was you.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.691
My father...

23:40.760 --> 23:43.047
I've been dreaming about you.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.526
I love you.

23:46.440 --> 23:47.805
You, too, Mama!

23:49.520 --> 23:50.521
Oh, no...

23:52.000 --> 23:53.490
The monster.

23:53.560 --> 23:56.723
Don't let it take me. Help me! Help me!

23:56.800 --> 23:57.936
Margaret, what are you talking about?

23:57.960 --> 23:59.450
Abandawe.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.850
You've said that to me before once.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.686
The cave, right'?

24:04.800 --> 24:05.881
The monster is coming.

24:05.960 --> 24:06.961
Margaret!

24:07.920 --> 24:09.496
What have you done to her,
you wicked heathen?

24:09.520 --> 24:11.124
You are not welcome here.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.482
Fine. We'll be going. Come, sister.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.801
Mr Campbell, please!

24:20.320 --> 24:22.800
Have you forgotten about our patron,
Mistress Abernathy?

24:24.400 --> 24:26.926
What have you to do
with Mistress Abernathy?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.604
This does not concern you!

24:28.680 --> 24:30.364
Your patron has taken my nephew.

24:30.440 --> 24:31.930
I know naught of your nephew.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.401
My only interest
is the Brahan Seer prophecy

24:34.480 --> 24:37.290
and the 200-year-old baby
that Mistress Abernathy's pursuing.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.361
Tell us!

24:38.440 --> 24:40.363
The prophecy states
that a new king of Scotland

24:40.440 --> 24:41.536
will arise upon the death of a child

24:41.560 --> 24:43.722
that's 200 years old
on the day it's born.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.251
Two-hundred-year-old baby...

24:46.320 --> 24:47.321
He's not making sense.

24:47.680 --> 24:48.727
Bree.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.121
Jamie!

25:05.040 --> 25:06.405
Margaret, we're leaving.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.882
Do you have the other photo,
the one with the dog?

25:11.960 --> 25:12.961
No.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.320
You are not leaving with her.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.776
I don't answer to the likes of you.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.964
Margaret, Mistress Abernathy is
expecting our services to be rendered.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.087
Do not touch me, Chinaman!

25:24.880 --> 25:27.201
I'm Yi Tien Cho.
I know what you've done to her!

25:27.800 --> 25:29.165
You are not worthy of this woman.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.046
Geillis must have taken it.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.360
Why would she take it?

25:37.440 --> 25:38.930
I told her...

25:39.000 --> 25:42.368
That I had a child in the future,
that Brianna was yours.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.804
She met her right before Geillis
came back through the stones.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.681
She thinks Brianna's
the 200-year-old baby.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.931
You'll come with me now.
Or must I use the stick?

25:53.000 --> 25:55.480
No. You made me
tell fortunes with riddles.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.210
I won't do it any more!

26:01.560 --> 26:03.085
She's going to go back there to...

26:03.640 --> 26:05.404
- Kill her.
- Yeah.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.720
We need to find Geillis, now.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.201
There's a place on the island,

26:09.280 --> 26:10.361
like Craigh na Dun.

26:10.920 --> 26:14.641
Father Fogden told me about it.
People disappear there. "Abandawe."

26:14.760 --> 26:16.250
Abandawe.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.846
Abandawe.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.686
Abandawe!

26:45.840 --> 26:47.365
Abandawe. Where?

26:49.760 --> 26:50.761
It bad place.

26:50.960 --> 26:51.961
Take us there.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.728
The boy there, he die.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.407
You follow, you die.

27:32.920 --> 27:33.921
That's it.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.201
She's in there.

27:55.560 --> 27:56.721
I can hear the hum.

27:59.320 --> 28:02.005
Jamie, the portal must be nearby.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.525
If it takes me...

28:04.040 --> 28:06.520
I may not be able
to come back through again.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.041
You ken that

28:10.320 --> 28:12.640
if anything should happen to me,
you must still follow her.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.241
You must go.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.526
We lost Faith.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.010
We will not lose Brianna.

28:43.880 --> 28:47.123
Don't worry.
You'll be sacrificed for a great cause.

28:51.920 --> 28:52.967
So you came, did you?

28:53.040 --> 28:54.041
Ian!

28:54.120 --> 28:55.724
Don't come any closer, fox.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.287
Persist, and Hercules
will put a bullet in your head.

29:04.680 --> 29:07.570
I only spare ye
because Claire is fond of you.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.525
Geillis, don't!

29:15.440 --> 29:16.521
Geillis!

29:25.760 --> 29:26.886
Geillis.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.246
A life for a life, sweet Claire.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.886
I saved you from the pyre
after the witch trial.

29:32.880 --> 29:33.881
Ye owe me a life.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.281
He's just a boy.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.805
He's just fodder for my passage.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.725
It's your daughter's life ye owe me.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.081
Geillis.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.766
I have to, Claire, for the greater good.

29:50.400 --> 29:55.008
It was then I realised
that the pool was the portal.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.568
We are the chosen, you and I.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.046
We have a responsibility
to change history.

30:12.360 --> 30:16.490
I gave up my child for the cause.
You must do the same.

30:17.520 --> 30:18.521
No!

30:31.880 --> 30:33.086
This is God's will!

30:34.000 --> 30:35.809
No!

30:49.480 --> 30:50.481
Go.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.406
Go. You're free.

31:07.480 --> 31:08.527
Uncle Jamie.

31:11.520 --> 31:12.726
Come to me.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.769
There's no reason to be afraid, lad.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.361
Claire?

31:26.840 --> 31:27.841
Claire.

31:30.960 --> 31:31.961
Claire.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.041
Let's get out of this place.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.244
I knew you'd come, Uncle Jamie.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.922
But ye left it a bit late, aye?

32:15.760 --> 32:17.091
I did, then.

32:18.960 --> 32:20.405
I'm sorry, Ian.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.282
We're all right now. Sassenach.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.484
She's from a cave in the Caribbean.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.843
Full grown, maybe late 40s.

32:39.560 --> 32:40.607
Broken neck?

32:41.560 --> 32:42.561
More than that.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.564
Somebody tried to cut
this lady's head clean off.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.281
It's all right.

33:04.840 --> 33:05.841
It's all right.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.446
We'll rest now.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.570
We must return to the ship.

33:18.800 --> 33:21.280
I told Fergus to gather our belongings,

33:21.360 --> 33:24.648
have Lesley and Hayes
make ready to sail.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.764
But first, I must hold you both.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.129
It was very generous of Lord John

34:07.200 --> 34:09.168
to use his influence
to withdraw the warrant.

34:09.239 --> 34:10.241
Aye...

34:10.880 --> 34:13.645
Aye, it'll be good
to return to Scotland, Sassenach.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.560
Be nice to be home.

34:17.840 --> 34:18.841
Aye.

34:23.679 --> 34:27.366
We'll return Ian straight to Jenny.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.606
He might not want to go back,
after all this adventure.

34:31.120 --> 34:32.884
I dinna care if he wants to or not.

34:33.560 --> 34:37.246
I'll deliver him to Lallybroch
if I must stuff him into a hogshead.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.443
Don't shave your beard.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.887
Four days' growth
since we left Kingston.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.761
Funny.

35:02.120 --> 35:04.009
You have some new white hairs here.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.770
Well, it's little wonder if I have.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.442
Surprised I dinna have
a full head of white hair,

35:10.520 --> 35:12.648
after all I've suffered
these past few months.

35:14.640 --> 35:15.880
I like this.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.201
It's different.

35:18.920 --> 35:19.921
Aye'?

35:21.640 --> 35:22.641
How different?

35:34.160 --> 35:38.529
When you kiss me, against my skin.

35:43.840 --> 35:47.765
Well, you have very fine skin,
Sassenach.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.681
Like pearl.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.136
Indeed, you have
a lot of very fine skin,

35:55.160 --> 35:56.491
if that's what you had in mind.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.245
That's more or less

36:01.200 --> 36:03.089
what I had in mind, yes.

36:05.320 --> 36:06.731
I have

36:07.880 --> 36:10.326
given much thought

36:12.920 --> 36:16.242
about what I want to do to you
when we arrive on dry land.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.451
And what's that?

36:20.720 --> 36:23.007
I've considered in great detail

36:23.560 --> 36:27.167
what I want to do to you,
should I have you naked and willing,

36:27.320 --> 36:28.321
and no one hearing.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.762
With enough room to serve you...

36:33.440 --> 36:34.441
Suitably.

36:35.720 --> 36:36.721
Well...

36:37.200 --> 36:38.326
I'm willing.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.127
And there's...

36:42.360 --> 36:44.203
Certainly enough room.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.009
And as for being naked...

36:49.720 --> 36:50.801
I'll see to that.

36:52.360 --> 36:53.646
It's all part of the plan.

36:54.880 --> 36:55.927
What's the plan?

37:00.320 --> 37:05.008
I shall take you to some private spot
in a heather of some rolling hill,

37:05.080 --> 37:07.128
and begin by sitting...

37:09.200 --> 37:10.201
Beside ye.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.564
I suppose that is a beginning.

37:14.360 --> 37:15.361
And what then?

37:16.520 --> 37:18.284
As for what's next...

37:19.280 --> 37:20.725
I shall take you on my knee...

37:22.320 --> 37:23.526
And kiss ye...

37:29.600 --> 37:31.204
So much for step one.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.486
And after that?

37:35.840 --> 37:37.285
Then I shall lay you down,

37:37.840 --> 37:40.047
twist your hair up in my hand.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.011
Taste your mouth,

37:42.080 --> 37:43.320
throat,

37:43.400 --> 37:44.890
and bosom with my lips.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.650
I shall do that
until you start making squeaking noises.

37:53.320 --> 37:56.005
I do not make "squeaking noises."

37:56.080 --> 37:59.004
Aye, you do. Hand me that towel.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.247
And then...

38:33.120 --> 38:34.121
Then what?

38:35.040 --> 38:36.041
And then...

38:39.280 --> 38:42.284
I shall lay you on your back.

38:44.160 --> 38:47.369
Now you might moan a bit,

38:47.440 --> 38:49.488
if ye like, to encourage me.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.442
Otherwise, you just lay still.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.001
Next,

39:00.040 --> 39:01.963
I shall lie upon my back

39:02.640 --> 39:05.769
and have you stretched out
at length upon me.

39:11.400 --> 39:14.847
So that I can take hold
of your buttocks and...

39:15.560 --> 39:16.891
Fondle them properly.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.281
My God.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.240
You have the roundest arse
I've ever seen.

39:22.680 --> 39:27.004
If you wish to kick your legs a bit,
or make lewd motions with your hips,

39:27.080 --> 39:30.482
and pant in my ear
and make those wee noises

39:30.560 --> 39:34.246
at any point in the proceedings,
I won't have any great objection.

39:34.320 --> 39:35.321
I do not pant

39:35.920 --> 39:37.684
or make 'wee noises."

39:38.040 --> 39:39.087
Do you not'?

39:40.080 --> 39:42.811
Well, then I shall
spread open your thighs...

39:44.000 --> 39:45.684
Take down my breeks, and...

39:46.360 --> 39:47.361
And what?

39:50.840 --> 39:52.285
And then we shall see

39:53.520 --> 39:56.524
what sort of noises
ye dinna make then, Sassenach.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.883
Cool air will be a blessing
after the heat of the island.

40:55.160 --> 40:56.525
Skies are turning.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.689
Steer her into the wind!

41:24.440 --> 41:25.601
Come on, lads.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.807
We have to hold it steady!

41:56.200 --> 41:57.326
We must help Milord!

41:57.400 --> 41:58.696
Ye'll do as ye're ordered this time!

41:58.720 --> 41:59.926
He needs all hands on deck.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.525
Mac Dubh kens what's best!

42:01.600 --> 42:04.080
Yes, he does.
And he wants you all to stay down here!

42:04.160 --> 42:06.766
It's best to let
the experienced sailors do their duty.

42:06.840 --> 42:08.126
I don't want to stay below,

42:08.200 --> 42:11.522
where I'll be tossed about with
no notion of what's happening overhead.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.320
You have no choice
in the matter, young man.

42:13.640 --> 42:14.971
Stay down here!

42:15.880 --> 42:17.176
Well, where are you going, Auntie?

42:17.200 --> 42:18.804
I'm still the ship's surgeon!

42:25.560 --> 42:26.561
Hold steady.

42:28.640 --> 42:31.803
You. Secure the cargo and get inside!

42:31.880 --> 42:32.961
Go, go!

42:56.200 --> 42:57.725
Claire!

43:02.760 --> 43:04.000
Claire!

43:04.800 --> 43:05.801
Jamie!

43:07.120 --> 43:10.249
It's too dangerous! Get back below.

43:13.160 --> 43:15.003
I can't hold it!

43:17.880 --> 43:19.120
Help me!

43:19.840 --> 43:21.285
Let me help you!

43:27.680 --> 43:29.205
I think it's broken.

43:29.480 --> 43:31.960
Come on, help me get him below.

43:32.560 --> 43:33.971
Brace yourself!

44:09.480 --> 44:11.005
Hold on!

44:21.600 --> 44:23.682
We're losing her!

44:37.400 --> 44:38.481
It's no use!

44:38.560 --> 44:40.562
She's gone broadside!

44:40.640 --> 44:43.450
Secure the helm
and help me get the men below!

44:43.520 --> 44:44.567
Get below!

44:45.280 --> 44:46.930
Everyone, get below deck!

44:47.000 --> 44:48.525
Everyone, below deck!

44:48.600 --> 44:49.726
Jamie!

44:52.000 --> 44:53.206
Get in, Fraser!

44:53.280 --> 44:54.486
I need to get my wife!

44:55.440 --> 44:56.487
Jamie!

44:57.440 --> 44:58.441
Claire!

45:05.800 --> 45:06.881
Claire!

45:42.120 --> 45:43.121
Claire!

45:48.000 --> 45:49.001
I was dead.

45:50.040 --> 45:52.850
Everything around me
was a blinding white.

45:54.200 --> 45:57.841
And there was a soft rushing sound,
like the wings of angels.

45:59.800 --> 46:01.404
I felt peaceful...

46:07.000 --> 46:08.240
And bodiless,

46:10.600 --> 46:13.524
free of terror, free of rage,

46:14.760 --> 46:16.967
filled with a quiet happiness.

47:30.280 --> 47:31.281
Claire.

47:33.640 --> 47:34.641
God.

47:38.320 --> 47:39.321
Claire!

47:40.280 --> 47:41.805
God damn you, Sassenach!

47:42.720 --> 47:45.724
If you die here now,
I swear I'll kill you.

49:51.840 --> 49:52.887
Sassenach...

50:05.320 --> 50:06.321
Thank Christ.

50:08.640 --> 50:09.926
I thought you were dead.

50:19.640 --> 50:21.688
I told you I'd never leave you again.

50:24.440 --> 50:25.726
You scared me half to death.

50:40.960 --> 50:42.166
Where are we'?

50:45.040 --> 50:46.246
I dinna ken.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.001
The Artemis?

50:59.760 --> 51:00.761
Are you all right, man'?

51:05.440 --> 51:06.566
Aye...

51:07.000 --> 51:08.001
We...

51:08.480 --> 51:10.084
We have all our limbs.

51:10.160 --> 51:12.686
You must be from the ship,
or what's left of it.

51:13.840 --> 51:16.923
She's run aground on the mud flats
four miles south of here.

51:17.760 --> 51:18.761
Are there...

51:19.760 --> 51:21.091
Any survivors?

51:21.160 --> 51:23.288
Aye, the folks
have gone down to care for them.

51:25.800 --> 51:27.962
What a mercy it is that you were saved.

51:28.040 --> 51:30.486
I've never seen
such a dreadful blow this time of year.

51:31.040 --> 51:32.280
I'm Joseph Olivier.

51:32.680 --> 51:34.921
This is my wife Patsy and our daughter.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.525
James Fraser and...

51:39.440 --> 51:40.771
And my...

51:40.840 --> 51:43.969
My wife, Claire.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.481
This...

51:53.560 --> 51:55.449
This may seem strange, but...

51:58.640 --> 51:59.641
Where are we'?

52:00.640 --> 52:02.051
We call it "Les Perles."

52:03.080 --> 52:04.809
What we mean to ask is...

52:07.120 --> 52:08.645
What island is this?

52:10.200 --> 52:11.850
You're not on an island at all.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.086
You're on the mainland,

52:14.680 --> 52:15.841
in the colony of Georgia.

52:17.800 --> 52:18.801
Georgia?

52:22.560 --> 52:23.721
America.
