00:32.323 --> 00:33.991
You're available
to start right away?

00:34.993 --> 00:36.160
Yes.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.625
I'm not really seeing
a lot of restaurant experience

00:43.626 --> 00:46.628
on the résumé.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.839
I've always had,
um, summer jobs,

00:48.840 --> 00:51.341
but, yeah, mostly retail.

00:57.515 --> 00:59.391
So did you drop out
of school, or...

00:59.392 --> 01:01.894
Why'd you come
all the way back here?

01:01.895 --> 01:04.271
No...

01:04.272 --> 01:05.480
Well, this is my home,

01:05.482 --> 01:07.483
and there was an accident,

01:07.484 --> 01:09.735
so I have to take care
of my brother.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.785
Well, I'll tell you
what I can do...

01:19.037 --> 01:20.537
I'll talk to the owner.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.539
I know they were looking for,

01:22.540 --> 01:26.043
waitstaff with experience,
but...

01:26.044 --> 01:28.045
obviously you're smart,
so maybe they'll,

01:28.046 --> 01:30.380
work with you, so...

01:30.381 --> 01:31.840
Sure, that'd be...
that'd be great.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.843
Maybe you could do...
host, if nothing else.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.512
Oh, sure, definitely.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.099
Okay, I mean,
I can't promise anything, but...

01:40.100 --> 01:41.308
- Oh, no, yeah.
- Maybe.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.559
I'll let you know
by the end of the day.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.019
Thank you so much.
Nice to meet you.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.104
Nice meeting you.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.579
I can make you some eggs
if you want.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.332
Yeah, I can make 'em too.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.751
I'm gonna go back to the clinic

03:30.752 --> 03:31.919
for a little while today.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.170
Will you be okay here alone?

03:34.339 --> 03:35.672
Something wrong?

03:35.673 --> 03:36.757
Dr. Barden thinks that

03:36.758 --> 03:38.842
he can help us
cut some of the costs.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.762
How?

03:42.889 --> 03:45.224
I... I have no idea,

03:45.225 --> 03:46.808
but I'll find out.

03:48.102 --> 03:51.355
So there'll probably be
some of this... yeah?

03:52.732 --> 03:54.024
Yeah, probably.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.567
Thank you.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.548
Thank you.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.804
Thank you both.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.058
Dr. Barden?

04:28.059 --> 04:29.393
The nurse said that I...

04:29.394 --> 04:30.644
Of course, come in.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.773
Iris, good to see you.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.024
Hi.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.819
Iris, Shepard Lambrick.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.612
Iris.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.073
Dr. Barden's told me
much about you.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.451
Iris, please, have a seat.
Shepard.

04:51.624 --> 04:52.958
So...

04:54.252 --> 04:55.919
Your brother.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.589
He's quite sick, correct?

04:59.590 --> 05:00.674
You can help him?

05:02.593 --> 05:04.928
Well, let's just say
that my foundation

05:04.929 --> 05:07.472
has the ability
to improve his situation.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.642
The Lambricks have funded
the building of clinics

05:10.643 --> 05:11.893
all over the world,

05:11.894 --> 05:14.438
Haiti, Afghanistan...

05:14.439 --> 05:15.605
Schools too.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.774
Well, my brother
doesn't need a school.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.610
You're right.

05:20.611 --> 05:21.862
Absolutely right.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.740
Because we're not
talking about that today.

05:26.409 --> 05:27.492
Not at all.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.789
My family also believes in

05:32.790 --> 05:36.126
creating opportunities for...

05:36.127 --> 05:38.211
everyday people,

05:38.212 --> 05:43.717
people who just haven't
received a fair shake in life,

05:43.718 --> 05:45.969
people like you
and your brother.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.013
What do we have to do?

05:49.599 --> 05:52.434
I'm hosting a dinner party
tomorrow night,

05:52.435 --> 05:54.269
and I'd like you to join us.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.688
Just me?

05:56.689 --> 05:57.898
Just you.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.108
But there will be
other guests there,

06:00.109 --> 06:02.527
individuals that
we'd also like to help,

06:02.528 --> 06:04.363
and the evening will culminate

06:04.364 --> 06:08.533
with a game of sorts,

06:08.534 --> 06:11.703
and the winner...

06:11.704 --> 06:13.830
will be taken care of.

06:13.831 --> 06:17.376
Bills, school, house...
everything.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.545
A contest.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.547
What if I don't win?

06:23.674 --> 06:26.093
Well, then you just don't win.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.177
That's it.

06:28.679 --> 06:32.015
I'm sorry, Dr. Barden, I...

06:32.016 --> 06:34.059
no offense to Mr. Lambrick,

06:34.060 --> 06:37.687
but is this legit?

06:37.688 --> 06:39.606
This is for real?

06:40.733 --> 06:42.401
Very real, Iris.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.905
Mr. Lambrick saved my life.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.035
Not long ago,

06:52.036 --> 06:54.830
but before I met
you and your brother,

06:54.831 --> 06:57.207
I was in the same position.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.543
I'd already lost my wife.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.211
I was on my way
to losing everything...

07:01.212 --> 07:02.587
this practice, everything.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.882
I had no place to turn.

07:08.052 --> 07:11.513
I was invited to this event,
so I went.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.266
You won?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.518
He did, and I am proud to say

07:16.519 --> 07:19.729
that the Lambrick Foundation
came through on its promise.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.398
Tenfold.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.111
You see what we might be able
to do for you.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.615
Well, money
would definitely help,

07:30.616 --> 07:34.744
but my brother needs
a bone marrow transplant.

07:36.205 --> 07:40.750
So do you mind
if I think this over?

07:40.751 --> 07:41.918
It's just...

07:41.919 --> 07:43.587
Short notice.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.255
It is. You're right.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.591
Of course, yes.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.301
Think it over.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.427
Do that.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.346
Well...

07:58.603 --> 08:02.272
But RSVP by 8:00 tonight

08:02.273 --> 08:04.024
if you do decide to join us.

08:07.695 --> 08:10.530
And my staff will make
arrangements to pick you up.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.949
Thank you.

08:15.119 --> 08:17.287
When I say
that we have the ability

08:17.288 --> 08:20.457
to dramatically improve
your brother's situation, Iris,

08:20.458 --> 08:23.543
it's not just the money
I'm talking about.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.712
You win the game,

08:25.713 --> 08:27.547
and we can bypass
any waiting list

08:27.548 --> 08:30.550
and locate a donor immediately.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.182
I will let you know.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.225
Thank you.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.985
She's perfect.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.823
This is the special du jour.

08:53.824 --> 08:57.494
It's pasta à la vegetable...

08:57.495 --> 08:58.828
Okay.

08:58.829 --> 09:01.498
Iris, that's a terrible
Italian accent.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.793
And if it's French,

09:04.794 --> 09:07.629
"monsieur" is not pronounced
"man sewer."

09:07.630 --> 09:08.838
- Monsieur.
- Monsieur.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.340
- Monsieur.
- Yes.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.259
Come on, seriously, like,
it's not gonna kill me

09:12.260 --> 09:13.718
to have some protein
now and then.

09:16.847 --> 09:17.889
Hello?

09:20.518 --> 09:21.851
Speaking.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.695
Okay, well, wait,

09:31.696 --> 09:34.656
what about the hostess position
that you...

09:37.952 --> 09:40.245
Okay, well, thank you.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.371
Thanks again.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.042
You mad at me or something?

09:46.043 --> 09:47.919
Why would I be mad at you?

09:52.216 --> 09:53.550
I thought I would be a match.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.220
I feel like I let you down.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.060
You can't always be the hero.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.106
Sometimes you have to let go.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.774
Like let go of you?

10:23.205 --> 10:24.831
Get down! Get down!
Give me cover!

10:29.837 --> 10:31.338
Killing lots of aliens?

10:31.339 --> 10:33.173
Nope, terrorists.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.175
Killing lots of terrorists?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.510
Straight up murderin'
these terrorists, yo.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.349
What's up?

10:42.350 --> 10:46.811
So, I'm gonna go out tonight.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.271
With who?

10:49.774 --> 10:52.942
I... I ran into a couple
friends from high school,

10:52.943 --> 10:56.363
and I thought, you know what?

10:56.364 --> 10:59.032
I should go and unwind.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.950
Yeah, let your hair down
and shit.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.370
Yeah, just go crazy.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.954
Yeah, cool.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.874
So you're gonna be okay here
alone for the night?

11:07.875 --> 11:09.834
Yeah.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.836
Got my meds, emergency contact.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.506
I'll just play video games
or whatever.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.550
I could really use the quiet.

11:18.427 --> 11:19.886
Great.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.179
Cool.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.556
Love you.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.574
Aren't you sick of this?

12:24.326 --> 12:27.495
Taking me back and forth
to the clinic,

12:27.496 --> 12:29.164
bills, taking care of me.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.331
Like, don't you want a life?

12:30.332 --> 12:31.458
No.

12:32.918 --> 12:36.087
I mean, yeah, I...

12:36.088 --> 12:37.547
It's hard,

12:37.548 --> 12:40.300
but, Raleigh,
you're my brother.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.720
This is my life.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.430
It's gonna be fine.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.765
We'll get through this.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.769
This way, please.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.021
Thank you.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.776
Pretty.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.194
Yes.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.449
Does the Lambrick family
live here?

13:46.450 --> 13:48.117
Not exactly.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.994
Property's owned
by the foundation.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.956
It's used for holidays
and special events like this.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.125
Dinner will begin shortly.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.127
You can wait in here
with all the other guests,

13:58.128 --> 14:01.965
and please help yourself to any
of the provided refreshments.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.807
Our eighth and final guest.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.229
Lucky number eight.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.486
Did everyone get
an introduction like that?

14:23.487 --> 14:25.655
Oh, yeah.
It's been very formal.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.074
It's nice to meet you guys.
I'm Iris.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.617
Lucas, and this is...

14:29.618 --> 14:30.660
Cal. How you doin'?

14:30.661 --> 14:32.036
Hi.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.288
Have you guys been here long?

14:33.289 --> 14:34.289
Not long.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.623
Couple minutes for some.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.625
Hour or two for the rest of us.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.085
Are you both from the area too?

14:39.086 --> 14:41.421
No, they flew me in
from Seattle.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.215
Iowa.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.342
Would you like
a little something to drink?

14:46.343 --> 14:49.012
No, I'm okay. Not yet.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.265
So what do you know
about the others?

14:52.266 --> 14:53.266
Anything?

14:53.267 --> 14:54.934
A little.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.270
As you can see,
they're not exactly gregarious.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.107
Big guy over there is Peter.

15:01.108 --> 15:05.028
Supposed to be some sort of
high-stakes gambler from Vegas.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.988
Not that any of us
have actually heard of him.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.365
That's the way
he made it sound.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.617
Yeah.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.410
Lady in the wheelchair
is Linda.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.703
She barely speaks.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.127
Kid in the corner is Travis.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.295
He's an Iraq vet.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.799
And he's got
that thousand-yard stare.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.677
What about the girl?

15:29.678 --> 15:31.679
Her name is Amy,

15:31.680 --> 15:33.890
and, yeah,
she's a real charmer.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.309
And the older gentleman?

15:38.228 --> 15:40.063
I don't think
I'd call him that.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.147
"Older"?

15:41.148 --> 15:42.482
"Gentleman."

15:42.483 --> 15:43.566
Why?

15:43.567 --> 15:45.735
Conway's a bit of a sourpuss.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.403
Yeah, he's...

15:47.404 --> 15:50.907
he has some conspiracy theories
about the Lambrick Foundation.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.034
Don't get him started.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.243
Maybe I will have a drink.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.912
Good.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.623
My very own specialty: BLT.

16:04.713 --> 16:05.922
Thank you.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.966
To the Lambrick Foundation.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.217
Salud.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.478
She's perfect.

16:22.106 --> 16:22.606
Case?

16:29.154 --> 16:31.197
I'm not sure
she's right for this.

16:31.198 --> 16:32.824
What?

16:32.825 --> 16:35.451
She couldn't be more perfect.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.787
She's fighting for her brother,
herself.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.789
She has no relatives,
no family,

16:39.790 --> 16:41.374
no one to ask questions.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.793
Shep, she is not right.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.465
Let's just say
I've appreciated your discretion

16:49.466 --> 16:51.134
over the last couple of years.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.723
Should I be concerned

16:56.724 --> 16:59.142
about this moment of weakness
on your part?

17:02.813 --> 17:04.063
Of course not.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.397
I'm fine.

17:09.486 --> 17:13.031
Bevans has informed me
that the last guest has arrived.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.199
We ought to get downstairs soon.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.871
Do we have to sit through
an entire dinner?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.705
Why can't we just
get it over with?

17:21.707 --> 17:23.415
Julian...

17:23.416 --> 17:25.334
That's not the way it works,
as you know.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.336
There is a process involved.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.589
Of course.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.760
I trust that you will be
on your best behavior tonight.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.637
I'm not even drinking.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.514
I'm serious.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.310
The integrity of the game

17:42.311 --> 17:45.980
requires minimal participation
on our part.

17:45.981 --> 17:49.984
You must remain
an objective observer,

17:49.985 --> 17:52.320
even if one of these people
is eliminated.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.488
Do you understand?

17:54.740 --> 17:56.657
And if one of them
has to be removed from the game,

17:56.658 --> 17:58.993
Bevans will be the one
to handle it.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.579
Your job, as a Lambrick,

18:01.580 --> 18:03.122
is simply to observe.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.793
You can engage these people
with questions and conversation,

18:06.794 --> 18:09.796
but you will
not so much as touch

18:09.797 --> 18:11.047
any of these people tonight.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.760
I know.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.348
Julian,

18:20.349 --> 18:23.976
look, I appreciate

18:23.977 --> 18:25.978
that you've taken an interest
in the foundation.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.230
I do.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.483
But what happened last year
was unacceptable.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.528
For the last time,

18:33.529 --> 18:34.570
I understand.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.572
Okay, okay, okay.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.740
I won't bring it up again.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.701
And you're underdressed again.

18:49.044 --> 18:52.380
We have one small matter
to clear up before we begin.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.882
In the interest of discretion

18:54.883 --> 18:58.553
and eliminating distraction
and unfair advantage,

18:58.554 --> 19:00.721
we ask that you leave
all possessions here

19:00.722 --> 19:02.390
during the game...

19:02.391 --> 19:04.058
phones, keys, et cetera.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.270
I don't like this.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.022
I don't like it.

19:10.023 --> 19:12.859
I assure you they will be safe.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.487
These are the rules.

19:40.470 --> 19:41.971
Right.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.140
If you're ready,

19:44.141 --> 19:46.475
I'll escort you
through to the dining room.

19:46.476 --> 19:47.560
This way.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.890
Please, take a seat.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.892
Place cards have been provided.

20:56.546 --> 20:57.880
Thank you.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.006
Of course.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.859
And good evening, everyone.

21:18.860 --> 21:22.530
I apologize
if I've kept anyone waiting.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.533
Welcome to the Lambrick house.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.576
This is my son, Julian.

21:27.577 --> 21:28.703
Hello.

21:30.747 --> 21:34.250
Now, you've all met
our butler, Bevans,

21:34.251 --> 21:36.002
and his staff, yes?

21:36.003 --> 21:37.169
Bevans...

21:38.422 --> 21:40.381
Let's start with some wine,
shall we?

21:49.433 --> 21:51.767
Dinner tonight
is seared foie gras

21:51.768 --> 21:54.312
and rib eye steak
with a red wine reduction

21:54.313 --> 21:58.357
served with asparagus
and garlic leek mashed potato.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.775
Enjoy.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.279
Haven't had a meal like this
in so long.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.489
Never had a meal like this.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.532
You kidding me?

22:11.288 --> 22:13.581
Yes?

22:13.582 --> 22:15.583
I probably should have
mentioned this before.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.835
I'm a vegetarian.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.256
Well, this is interesting.

22:22.257 --> 22:26.052
We don't have anything else
in the kitchen, Iris.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.136
Okay.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.471
I...I don't mean to be a bother.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.806
The potatoes are fine.
I'll be fine.

22:30.807 --> 22:33.017
So have you always
been a vegetarian?

22:34.394 --> 22:36.979
Most of my life, yes.
Long time.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.689
- I just can't imagine eating...
- I think...

22:40.067 --> 22:43.069
That we have just found
our first opportunity

22:43.070 --> 22:46.572
to award some money tonight.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.492
Iris.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.578
I would like for you to eat
the steak and the foie gras.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.914
I really would.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.582
I can't do that.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.793
You can...

22:58.794 --> 23:00.127
but you won't...

23:00.128 --> 23:01.170
yet.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.758
No, I really... I can't do it.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.218
I'm not trying to be rude.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.887
I just...I won't do it.

23:09.888 --> 23:14.642
Listen, I understand
that it's not going to be easy,

23:14.643 --> 23:18.938
but I refuse to accept...

23:18.939 --> 23:23.609
that you don't have a price.

23:23.610 --> 23:27.446
$5,000 to eat the steak

23:27.447 --> 23:31.283
and this decadent foie gras.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.455
Make it $10,000.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.587
$10,000.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.259
What could you do with that?

23:48.260 --> 23:49.760
You should eat it.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.304
Just close your eyes.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.806
It's a lot of money.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.458
Eat it with some of the liver.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.628
I can't believe I'm doing this.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.380
Yeah, for $10,000, though.

24:28.592 --> 24:32.470
A lifetime of discipline

24:32.471 --> 24:34.305
and commitment to cause

24:34.306 --> 24:38.309
wiped away by a mere $10,000.

24:45.775 --> 24:47.776
Well...

24:47.777 --> 24:49.862
That is nothing

24:49.863 --> 24:51.989
compared to what's
really at stake tonight.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.616
I can assure you of that.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.041
You don't like the wine?

25:03.919 --> 25:06.670
Well, no, it's not that.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.714
We can get you something else.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.466
We have some wonderful scotch.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.260
No. No, thanks. I don't drink.

25:15.222 --> 25:18.224
Oh, I see.

25:18.225 --> 25:21.602
You're a recovering alcoholic.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.103
Aren't you?

25:26.942 --> 25:28.609
That's not your business.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.778
On the contrary.

25:30.779 --> 25:33.405
You are here essentially
begging me for money.

25:33.406 --> 25:35.074
How is that not my business?

25:39.329 --> 25:40.996
How long has it been?

25:46.253 --> 25:47.336
It's been 16 years,

25:47.337 --> 25:49.338
and I turned everything
in my life around.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.007
But you haven't.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.342
Look at you.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.928
You're still mired in a pit
of poor health

25:55.929 --> 25:58.222
and crippling debt.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.849
I'd hate to see what
you looked like 16 years ago.

26:00.850 --> 26:03.310
I mean, really.
What's the point?

26:03.311 --> 26:04.478
Please.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.314
Why are you doing this?

26:09.234 --> 26:11.151
Because I want to help you.

26:12.487 --> 26:13.696
Look...

26:15.156 --> 26:18.158
It's safe to say that drinking

26:18.159 --> 26:21.245
is what ruined your life
in the first place, isn't it?

26:21.246 --> 26:23.247
So what if

26:23.248 --> 26:27.042
drinking again
could help you save it?

26:27.043 --> 26:28.752
What?

26:28.753 --> 26:32.423
I will give you $10,000

26:32.424 --> 26:34.633
if you drink
that glass of wine.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.804
No.

26:38.805 --> 26:41.140
No. No way. No.
You don't understand.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.100
You have no idea
how hard I've worked.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.812
But Iris here,

26:46.813 --> 26:49.481
she just devoured
a pile of meat,

26:49.482 --> 26:51.609
and she's a devout vegetarian,

26:51.610 --> 26:54.278
and you won't drink
a little wine?

26:54.279 --> 26:55.613
It's totally different.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.323
Why are you doing this to me?

26:59.075 --> 27:01.076
$50,000.

27:02.370 --> 27:04.038
If you will drink...

27:07.167 --> 27:09.168
This decanter

27:09.169 --> 27:12.671
of the finest scotch
that money can buy

27:12.672 --> 27:14.173
right now.

27:14.174 --> 27:17.009
$50,000.

27:18.219 --> 27:19.803
This is what, a test?
This is not real.

27:19.804 --> 27:20.888
Oh, no...

27:22.599 --> 27:24.433
I am deadly serious, Conway,

27:24.434 --> 27:26.101
and you know that I am.

27:27.854 --> 27:30.022
The glass of wine

27:30.023 --> 27:32.941
or the whole damn decanter.

27:32.942 --> 27:34.610
Now, it seems to me
that the wine,

27:34.611 --> 27:37.613
that's pretty simple,

27:37.614 --> 27:38.781
isn't it?

27:38.782 --> 27:41.283
But the scotch...

27:41.284 --> 27:44.578
Well, we could consider that...

27:46.623 --> 27:48.957
A momentary lapse to...

27:50.460 --> 27:52.127
Change your life.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.300
I'm sorry.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.345
I'm sorry.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.305
So what would you rather do?

28:24.327 --> 28:25.994
That's a good man.

28:25.995 --> 28:27.496
Hey.

28:27.497 --> 28:28.664
Bevans.

28:29.958 --> 28:33.544
That was brilliant, as usual.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.462
My compliments to Marcel.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.264
Regarding tonight's game,

28:45.265 --> 28:49.852
please allow me to alleviate
any concerns you have.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.313
We haven't already
been playing?

28:53.314 --> 28:56.442
Oh, no, the game has yet
to officially begin.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.902
What exactly is the game?

28:58.903 --> 29:02.906
Well, it is not a quiz
or a trivia contest,

29:02.907 --> 29:06.744
nor is it a test of
brute strength or athleticism.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.371
At its core,
it's just a children's game,

29:09.372 --> 29:10.873
and I would wager

29:10.874 --> 29:12.708
that some of you
here this evening

29:12.709 --> 29:17.880
have played "Would You Rather?"
at some point.

29:19.174 --> 29:22.009
So how do we play?

29:23.553 --> 29:28.056
In each round, each player
will be given a choice

29:28.057 --> 29:31.393
between A or B,

29:31.394 --> 29:33.061
and usually,

29:33.062 --> 29:35.731
neither choice
is very attractive.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.316
Let's see if I can
give you an example.

29:37.317 --> 29:38.567
Travis.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.197
Travis, would you rather...

29:43.198 --> 29:45.866
kiss Iris

29:45.867 --> 29:46.867
or...

29:46.868 --> 29:47.868
Peter?

29:50.622 --> 29:52.956
- Guess I'd kiss Iris.
- Very good.

29:52.957 --> 29:57.294
Now, this is where our version
of the game is different.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.129
Whatever you choose,

29:59.130 --> 30:02.591
you must act upon.

30:02.592 --> 30:03.926
So in this case,

30:03.927 --> 30:08.597
Travis, you must walk over
and kiss Iris.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.974
You're gonna make us
kiss each other?

30:12.393 --> 30:13.435
No, no, no.

30:13.436 --> 30:14.895
Nothing like that, my dear.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.980
No, that was just
off the top of my head.

30:16.981 --> 30:21.485
Now, as the game continues

30:21.486 --> 30:24.488
with one dilemma after another,

30:24.489 --> 30:27.157
eliminating players as we go

30:27.158 --> 30:31.495
until we have a winner.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.664
And how are players eliminated?

30:33.665 --> 30:34.998
Well, if a player

30:34.999 --> 30:37.584
is no longer capable
of continuing,

30:37.585 --> 30:40.963
for whatever reason,
then they are eliminated.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.048
What if someone refuses
to make a choice?

30:43.049 --> 30:46.176
Like, if Travis didn't want
to kiss either of us?

30:46.177 --> 30:48.637
If you refuse to choose.

30:48.638 --> 30:49.805
Well, I am afraid

30:49.806 --> 30:52.641
that that would be grounds
for elimination.

30:52.642 --> 30:54.309
And one more thing.

30:55.562 --> 30:58.146
The dilemmas are timed.

31:00.024 --> 31:05.737
And you must make your decision
in 15 seconds,

31:05.738 --> 31:08.532
or you will be eliminated.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.952
Hold up. Is all this necessary?

31:11.953 --> 31:13.370
I mean, couldn't you
help all of us?

31:13.371 --> 31:15.038
Why does this have to be
a game?

31:15.039 --> 31:18.041
Because,

31:18.042 --> 31:22.754
as simple as the game is,

31:22.755 --> 31:28.093
it's all about decision making
in its rawest form.

31:28.094 --> 31:31.221
And there's no better window
into a person's character

31:31.222 --> 31:32.848
than the decisions
that they make

31:32.849 --> 31:34.516
and how they make them

31:34.517 --> 31:37.519
and how one applies

31:37.520 --> 31:40.022
rationale and ethics and reason

31:40.023 --> 31:42.524
while under duress.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.030
Tonight...

31:50.033 --> 31:52.159
Will test your limits

31:52.160 --> 31:56.038
and ultimately prove...

31:56.039 --> 31:58.707
whether you deserve our help.

31:58.708 --> 32:03.086
If anyone no longer
wishes to play,

32:03.087 --> 32:07.883
now is your opportunity
to leave.

32:07.884 --> 32:10.093
We have cars waiting outside.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.348
Anyone?

32:33.409 --> 32:34.785
All right.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.496
We have a full house.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.582
And so...

32:43.211 --> 32:46.588
Here...

32:46.589 --> 32:49.925
we...

32:49.926 --> 32:51.343
go.

32:58.935 --> 33:01.979
Our man Bevans,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:05.024 --> 33:08.443
Did you know he was formerly
an agent with MI5?

33:08.444 --> 33:10.278
Many years ago.

33:10.279 --> 33:11.613
An interrogator.

33:16.035 --> 33:18.120
Is this one of your old toys,
Bevans?

33:19.330 --> 33:20.622
It is, sir.

33:20.623 --> 33:23.250
Car batteries with some
aftermarket configurations.

33:26.671 --> 33:29.006
What... what the hell is this?

33:29.007 --> 33:30.757
Oh, no.
I see where this is going.

33:30.758 --> 33:31.842
Conway?

33:31.843 --> 33:34.344
I knew this was too good
to be true.

33:34.345 --> 33:37.139
This is a joke.
You just want to hurt us.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.807
You people,
are you gonna sit here,

33:38.808 --> 33:40.100
and you're gonna let this sick,

33:40.101 --> 33:42.477
perverted son of a bitch
debase you?

33:42.478 --> 33:43.729
Be my guest.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.230
Someone's had
a little too much to drink.

33:45.231 --> 33:46.398
That's right!

33:46.399 --> 33:47.482
That's right,
and I'm going home.

33:47.483 --> 33:49.359
No, you've already
been given that chance.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.485
I don't care!

33:50.486 --> 33:51.820
I'm done with this!

33:51.821 --> 33:53.155
You were warned.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.990
You go to hell,
you sick motherfucker!

34:19.348 --> 34:22.016
I would like to go home.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.601
Well, obviously,

34:23.603 --> 34:27.272
participation
is no longer voluntary.

34:27.273 --> 34:30.525
I believe we just made that
perfectly clear.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.906
Bevans, shall we?

35:02.141 --> 35:04.226
What's this?

35:04.227 --> 35:05.352
What are we doing?

35:05.353 --> 35:08.021
Cal, you're up first.

35:08.022 --> 35:10.941
So, Cal,

35:10.942 --> 35:13.443
would you rather...

35:13.444 --> 35:14.945
electrocute yourself,

35:14.946 --> 35:17.114
or would you rather

35:17.115 --> 35:18.949
electrocute Amy?

35:18.950 --> 35:21.118
The blue button is for you.

35:21.119 --> 35:25.455
Press the red button
if you'd rather zap Amy.

35:25.456 --> 35:28.291
And you have...

35:28.292 --> 35:30.377
15 seconds to decide,

35:30.378 --> 35:32.003
beginning now.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.006
- W-wait.
- Wait.

35:35.007 --> 35:37.008
- Stop, stop, don't push it.
- Wait, Bevans...

35:37.009 --> 35:38.301
Okay, wait, wait, stop.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.928
Don't push the button.

35:53.359 --> 35:54.526
Moving on.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.657
You're not serious.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.118
No! Oh, no!

36:03.119 --> 36:05.287
- Oh, come on!
- Blue is for Linda.

36:05.288 --> 36:08.039
No, no, no, no, no, please!

36:08.040 --> 36:09.166
Amy.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.917
You're next.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.837
Would you rather
electrocute yourself or...

36:13.838 --> 36:14.921
Wait...

36:17.717 --> 36:18.842
Take it easy!

36:18.843 --> 36:20.844
We're competing, right?

36:24.640 --> 36:26.641
No timer needed.

36:26.642 --> 36:27.726
Linda.

36:27.727 --> 36:28.768
Linda!

36:32.523 --> 36:35.066
Bevans, is she ready?

36:37.111 --> 36:38.904
Linda.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.488
Can you hear me?

36:43.367 --> 36:44.451
Your turn.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.704
I can't do this.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.331
Well, you have to do it, Linda.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.333
You must make a decision.

36:51.334 --> 36:52.834
It's the game.

36:52.835 --> 36:55.170
Red is for Peter.

36:55.171 --> 36:56.671
I don't think
I can do this either.

36:58.674 --> 36:59.758
All right.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.551
What was that?

37:03.137 --> 37:04.638
Christ.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.306
Would you rather

37:06.307 --> 37:08.266
electrocute yourself,

37:08.267 --> 37:09.643
again,

37:09.644 --> 37:12.270
or shock Peter?

37:12.271 --> 37:13.730
15 seconds.

37:23.532 --> 37:25.367
Fuck!

37:29.038 --> 37:31.373
Well done, both of you.

37:32.708 --> 37:34.709
Next.

38:40.276 --> 38:41.568
Are you okay?

38:41.569 --> 38:42.652
Stall 'em.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.112
- Are you okay?
- I can do one more.

38:44.113 --> 38:46.031
- What?
- Just stall 'em.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.532
I'm not gonna shock you.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.376
Iris.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.670
What have you seen
in the last ten minutes

39:00.671 --> 39:01.880
that leads you to believe

39:01.881 --> 39:03.465
you don't have to perform
in this round?

39:05.092 --> 39:07.385
Keep... still.

39:10.222 --> 39:11.639
Much better.

39:14.310 --> 39:16.978
Red is for Iris.

39:18.356 --> 39:21.816
Now, Lucas,
what would you rather do?

40:05.277 --> 40:07.779
Red is for Cal.

40:07.780 --> 40:11.658
Iris, would you rather
electrocute yourself

40:11.659 --> 40:14.786
or Cal for the second time?

40:16.372 --> 40:17.997
You do what you got to do.

40:19.625 --> 40:20.667
Go.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.516
That's an interesting choice.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.230
Right.

40:45.067 --> 40:47.235
Well done, everyone.

40:47.236 --> 40:49.195
Very well done.

40:49.196 --> 40:50.738
Now...

40:52.783 --> 40:54.117
I'm gonna give you a moment,
all,

40:54.118 --> 40:56.786
to compose yourselves

40:56.787 --> 41:00.790
while we prepare
for the next round.

41:26.358 --> 41:29.027
Listen, we just need a moment,
some kind of distraction.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.862
If we all move at once,
we can overpower 'em.

41:30.863 --> 41:32.322
It seems like
they're all packing,

41:32.323 --> 41:33.490
so that's not much of a plan.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.492
If we can disarm one,
I can shoot.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.368
That'll even the odds
pretty fucking quick.

41:37.369 --> 41:39.287
What about the doors?
They have us locked in.

41:39.288 --> 41:41.372
I saw a couple of 'em
with sets of keys.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.209
Here comes another set
right now.

41:47.755 --> 41:49.172
Hi, everyone.

41:56.305 --> 42:00.141
The game's getting pretty
intense already, right?

42:00.142 --> 42:02.435
Why are you doing this?

42:02.436 --> 42:04.562
"Why are you doing this?"

42:05.648 --> 42:06.814
You're fucking crazy.

42:09.735 --> 42:11.736
You know...

42:11.737 --> 42:13.738
you agreed to be here.

42:15.908 --> 42:18.701
You're basically asking
my family for a handout.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.872
The least you could do, pig,

42:22.873 --> 42:24.707
is show a little
fucking respect.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.751
Psycho little bitch.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.419
Excuse me, what?

42:28.420 --> 42:30.588
You heard me, bitch.

42:30.589 --> 42:32.507
I'm sorry, we didn't get
formally introduced.

42:32.508 --> 42:33.758
Well, now we have.

42:33.759 --> 42:35.677
How about you show us
a little respect?

42:35.678 --> 42:36.803
Stop.

42:38.347 --> 42:39.514
What's your name?

42:42.810 --> 42:44.477
Name, pig! What's your name?

42:44.478 --> 42:45.937
- Travis Schulke!
- Okay, Travis.

42:45.938 --> 42:47.939
Travis,

42:47.940 --> 42:49.232
you're the soldier, right?

42:50.985 --> 42:52.485
Well, allow me to thank you

42:52.486 --> 42:55.321
for your bravery
and your service.

42:55.322 --> 42:57.490
Really.

42:57.491 --> 43:00.827
But yeah, that said...

43:01.870 --> 43:04.747
Opening your mouth
was a big mistake.

43:04.748 --> 43:06.874
Easy, easy.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.084
So...

43:14.049 --> 43:17.051
Cover the walls and the...

43:17.052 --> 43:18.553
area around the table.

43:25.311 --> 43:27.645
Wait. What are you guys doing?

43:27.646 --> 43:30.398
That was incredibly stupid,
Travis.

43:30.399 --> 43:32.275
I will fuck that guy up
if I get the chance.

43:32.276 --> 43:33.526
But you won't.

43:33.527 --> 43:34.736
Cool it.

43:36.530 --> 43:38.948
They want us
to turn on each other.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.451
If we stay logical,
we can turn the tables on 'em.

43:41.452 --> 43:42.744
She's on her own.

43:43.829 --> 43:45.079
Look around you.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.205
Yeah, we're fucked.

44:46.100 --> 44:49.102
And so we begin again.

44:49.103 --> 44:53.648
Does anyone need to use
the restroom or anything?

44:56.652 --> 44:59.028
I'm just joking.

44:59.029 --> 45:01.197
I know you're probably all
just as eager

45:01.198 --> 45:03.199
to keep playing as we are.

45:05.035 --> 45:07.036
Now, in this round,

45:07.037 --> 45:09.706
you will each get 30 seconds

45:09.707 --> 45:12.208
in order to make your decision,
all right?

45:12.209 --> 45:14.711
So let's begin with...

45:14.712 --> 45:15.837
Iris.

45:18.841 --> 45:22.009
Iris, would you rather...

45:23.595 --> 45:26.514
Stab Cal in the thigh

45:26.515 --> 45:27.932
with an ice pick...

45:27.933 --> 45:29.100
What?

45:29.101 --> 45:31.436
Or...

45:31.437 --> 45:35.064
strike Travis three times

45:35.065 --> 45:38.067
with this
African whipping staff,

45:38.068 --> 45:39.777
a sjambok?

45:39.778 --> 45:41.446
Oh, my God.

45:41.447 --> 45:43.531
They're gonna kill us!

45:43.532 --> 45:44.699
Look, Iris,

45:44.700 --> 45:47.869
three whacks from that,
I'll be okay.

45:47.870 --> 45:50.496
If I stab him,
I could kill him, right?

45:50.497 --> 45:52.665
And it's only three.

45:52.666 --> 45:54.959
It's gonna hurt, though, man.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.502
I know.
Let's just get it over with.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.422
The clock is ticking.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.140
Sjambok it is.

46:11.560 --> 46:14.395
Now, Iris,

46:14.396 --> 46:16.898
you have to put
your back into this?

46:16.899 --> 46:18.858
There's no just tapping him.

46:18.859 --> 46:20.276
That doesn't count.

46:21.820 --> 46:24.781
And Travis,

46:24.782 --> 46:26.282
this is going to hurt,

46:26.283 --> 46:29.619
so make yourself comfortable.

46:32.623 --> 46:33.998
Like this, ma'am.

46:33.999 --> 46:35.625
Across the back.

46:41.298 --> 46:43.424
Travis?

46:43.425 --> 46:45.134
Go ahead, Iris.

46:52.601 --> 46:54.727
No. No, no, no, no, no.

46:54.728 --> 46:56.062
That won't count.

47:06.782 --> 47:08.950
Fuck.

47:11.787 --> 47:13.120
All right.

47:16.750 --> 47:18.543
That looked like it hurt,
Travis.

47:18.544 --> 47:20.044
Well, it did.

47:21.129 --> 47:22.630
Are you okay?

47:22.631 --> 47:24.131
I've been through worse.

47:25.133 --> 47:26.843
Lucas.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.303
You're next.

47:29.304 --> 47:32.974
Would you rather
stab Iris in the thigh...

47:34.643 --> 47:36.143
Or...

47:38.272 --> 47:40.481
Give Travis three more strikes?

47:40.482 --> 47:43.150
Oh, come on!

48:00.961 --> 48:03.296
Look, it's a really dangerous
place to stab somebody.

48:03.297 --> 48:05.715
There's a major artery there.

48:05.716 --> 48:07.758
You know what I'm saying?

48:07.759 --> 48:08.968
I do.

48:08.969 --> 48:10.303
Let's just get it over with.

48:17.185 --> 48:19.020
The sjambok again.

48:45.213 --> 48:47.131
Sorry, man.

48:56.975 --> 48:58.142
Travis...

49:00.729 --> 49:02.897
You're probably relieved
to find out

49:02.898 --> 49:04.231
that it's your turn.

49:04.232 --> 49:06.275
Something like that.

49:06.276 --> 49:07.485
All right, then.

49:07.486 --> 49:09.320
Let's get it over with.

49:09.321 --> 49:11.155
Travis...

49:13.325 --> 49:14.492
Would you rather...

49:15.911 --> 49:16.911
Stab Lucas,

49:16.912 --> 49:19.997
the man who just whipped you,

49:19.998 --> 49:21.082
or...

49:21.083 --> 49:23.250
drumroll, please...

49:24.419 --> 49:26.253
Take three more lashes,

49:26.254 --> 49:29.548
this time
administered by Bevans?

49:31.385 --> 49:33.594
Ser...seriously, man.

49:33.595 --> 49:34.804
I can't...

49:34.805 --> 49:36.013
I can't do this anymore.

49:37.474 --> 49:39.035
I wonder why
you're being singled out.

49:44.106 --> 49:47.108
What the fuck is the matter
with you people?

49:47.109 --> 49:50.361
What did I ever do to you,

49:52.823 --> 49:54.573
What?

50:00.455 --> 50:02.623
That's... that's what I thought.

50:03.709 --> 50:05.292
Travis, we need a decision.

50:06.670 --> 50:08.004
Yeah.

50:08.005 --> 50:10.297
Yeah, fucking whip.

50:10.298 --> 50:11.799
I'm not stabbing anybody.

50:16.471 --> 50:18.514
We have to stop this.
We have to.

50:18.515 --> 50:19.974
Yeah, wait.

50:19.975 --> 50:22.059
Wait, stop...stop.

50:22.060 --> 50:25.438
Travis, just stab me
in the thigh, okay?

50:25.439 --> 50:26.480
We can't watch this go on.

50:26.481 --> 50:28.566
I'm not stabbing anybody.

50:28.567 --> 50:29.608
Travis, come on.

50:29.609 --> 50:31.944
Lucas, this is admirable,

50:31.945 --> 50:33.237
but it's against the rules.

50:33.238 --> 50:34.697
But I'm okay with it.

50:34.698 --> 50:36.532
He can't go back.
His first choice is final.

50:36.533 --> 50:37.616
Just hold on a second.

50:37.617 --> 50:38.617
I said I'm okay with it!

50:38.618 --> 50:39.952
It's okay.

50:39.953 --> 50:40.995
Come on.

50:40.996 --> 50:42.538
- Lucas.
- It's okay.

50:42.539 --> 50:44.540
This is all very admirable.

50:44.541 --> 50:46.167
His decision.

50:51.673 --> 50:52.840
It's okay.

50:57.721 --> 51:00.014
It's just like life, isn't it?

51:02.642 --> 51:04.268
There's no do-overs.

51:22.871 --> 51:25.748
Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis.

51:25.749 --> 51:27.124
Hey, hey, hey.

51:29.252 --> 51:30.836
He's in trouble.

51:30.837 --> 51:32.338
He needs medical attention.

52:00.325 --> 52:01.992
Peter...

52:03.078 --> 52:05.246
I'm awfully sorry,

52:05.247 --> 52:06.914
but I'm afraid it's your turn.

52:09.417 --> 52:11.335
You know the drill by now.

52:12.420 --> 52:14.255
The pick

52:14.256 --> 52:16.757
or give Travis three more.

52:21.471 --> 52:23.472
If I do the pick,
who does it have to be?

52:25.100 --> 52:27.935
I'm sure you've already
worked the angles on that one,

52:27.936 --> 52:29.103
haven't you?

52:31.231 --> 52:32.565
Well...

52:33.692 --> 52:36.193
I don't want to stab a lady.

52:36.194 --> 52:37.653
I'm not Mr. Manners
or anything,

52:37.654 --> 52:41.031
but I think there's some common
decency considerations here.

52:43.451 --> 52:44.451
30 seconds.

52:46.121 --> 52:49.123
On the other hand,
Travis is in real bad shape.

52:49.124 --> 52:51.292
We can't really hit him anymore,
can we?

52:52.627 --> 52:54.461
Honestly, Linda,

52:54.462 --> 52:55.963
you're paralyzed, right?

52:58.133 --> 53:00.092
Your leg wouldn't feel this
anyway.

53:00.093 --> 53:02.428
No, please.

53:02.429 --> 53:05.389
If I whip him with this thing,
he's going to die.

53:05.390 --> 53:07.558
And haven't we all
been saying this whole time

53:07.559 --> 53:09.226
that we have to work together?

53:12.480 --> 53:14.148
Well, unfortunately,

53:14.149 --> 53:17.359
you're gonna have to take one
for the team, Linda.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.278
I'm sorry.

53:20.363 --> 53:21.655
You're gonna be okay,
I promise.

53:21.656 --> 53:22.823
Just close your eyes.

53:24.993 --> 53:27.494
In and then out, okay?

53:27.495 --> 53:28.913
Don't push it too far.

53:30.332 --> 53:31.457
Fuck.

53:38.924 --> 53:40.174
- Oh, shit.
- Holy crap.

53:40.175 --> 53:41.342
I think I hit that artery.

53:41.343 --> 53:42.509
Do you have a belt?

53:42.510 --> 53:44.511
Tie it. Tie it. Hurry.

53:44.512 --> 53:45.721
What happened?

53:47.098 --> 53:48.432
You're okay. You're okay.

53:50.727 --> 53:53.395
Can we not take her to
a hospital or something here?

53:53.396 --> 53:54.521
This isn't good.

53:54.522 --> 53:56.690
People, we're playing a game.

53:56.691 --> 53:59.318
Linda, it's your turn.

53:59.319 --> 54:03.447
Now, would you rather
whip Travis

54:03.448 --> 54:06.784
or give your neighbor Amy
down there

54:06.785 --> 54:09.745
the old in and out?

54:09.746 --> 54:11.247
What?

54:11.248 --> 54:12.915
Can we not give her a sec?

54:12.916 --> 54:14.750
Peter, what's going on, man?

54:14.751 --> 54:16.961
Is the tourniquet supposed
to go above or below the wound?

54:16.962 --> 54:18.212
- Above, above!
- Okay, okay.

54:18.213 --> 54:19.255
My God, tighten it!

54:19.256 --> 54:20.464
- I got it. I got it.
- Tighter!

54:20.465 --> 54:22.258
Linda has not
made a decision yet.

54:22.259 --> 54:24.635
Linda!

54:24.636 --> 54:26.553
Travis or...

54:26.554 --> 54:28.222
Bitch!

54:28.223 --> 54:30.015
You fucking scratched me.

54:34.062 --> 54:36.689
Linda.

54:36.690 --> 54:38.023
Stupendous.

54:39.901 --> 54:41.402
But then, come to think of it,

54:41.403 --> 54:44.071
she didn't have another choice.

54:44.072 --> 54:46.573
She couldn't whip Travis
even if she wanted to.

54:46.574 --> 54:47.741
She can't walk.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.745
So let's...

54:51.746 --> 54:53.706
change things up
a little bit here.

54:53.707 --> 54:54.790
Amy...

54:57.711 --> 55:00.337
Would you rather
whip Travis or...

55:01.756 --> 55:04.967
Stab any player
of your choosing?

55:11.474 --> 55:14.685
In case any of y'all
haven't figured this out yet,

55:14.686 --> 55:17.521
this game isn't about
helpin' each other.

55:18.815 --> 55:20.816
It's about eliminating
the rest of you.

55:22.819 --> 55:24.486
Bevans...

55:27.449 --> 55:29.450
This one's probably gonna
bleed to death.

55:33.580 --> 55:34.747
You're okay.

55:38.668 --> 55:40.002
Duck.

55:42.422 --> 55:43.505
Duck.

55:47.510 --> 55:49.636
Goose.

55:49.637 --> 55:51.096
Hey, hold on a second.

55:51.097 --> 55:53.265
Okay, okay.

55:53.266 --> 55:54.641
She's made her decision.

55:54.642 --> 55:57.269
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

55:57.270 --> 55:58.771
Can I stab her anywhere?

56:00.440 --> 56:02.066
Well, that's a new one.

56:07.530 --> 56:09.990
Just from the shoulders down.

56:11.409 --> 56:12.409
No!

56:14.913 --> 56:16.080
Let me see. Let me see.

56:16.081 --> 56:17.873
Can you breathe?

56:20.335 --> 56:22.127
I think she missed the lung.

56:22.128 --> 56:23.729
Put some pressure on it.
Can you breathe?

56:24.756 --> 56:25.923
Tighter.

56:29.344 --> 56:30.677
Tight.

56:30.678 --> 56:31.762
Travis?

56:34.432 --> 56:35.766
Bevans.

57:41.249 --> 57:42.916
Still breathing, sir.

57:42.917 --> 57:44.084
Remarkable.

57:47.964 --> 57:49.756
Guys, she hasn't moved
for a while.

57:49.757 --> 57:52.259
Stabbed an old woman, Peter.

57:53.678 --> 57:54.761
Linda.

57:54.762 --> 57:56.221
See, she's unconscious.

58:00.351 --> 58:01.977
She's not unconscious.

58:01.978 --> 58:03.520
She's dead.

58:14.532 --> 58:16.033
You guys saw what happened,
right?

58:16.034 --> 58:17.659
I tried to help her.

58:17.660 --> 58:20.245
Oh, yes, Peter,
we all saw what happened.

58:21.414 --> 58:23.749
You made a decision.

58:23.750 --> 58:25.083
There was a consequence.

58:27.212 --> 58:29.213
And now...

58:29.214 --> 58:32.716
Cal is the one
to make a choice.

58:38.181 --> 58:41.683
Finish off Travis here or...

58:41.684 --> 58:43.977
stab Lucas.

58:43.978 --> 58:46.146
Stab Lucas like the others?

58:46.147 --> 58:47.981
Like Linda,
that's what you're saying?

58:47.982 --> 58:50.192
30 seconds.

58:51.819 --> 58:54.321
Okay, come on.
Let's get it over with.

58:55.406 --> 58:58.075
Maybe Amy is right.

58:58.076 --> 59:00.911
Eliminate a player.

59:00.912 --> 59:02.371
That's what this is about.

59:02.372 --> 59:04.331
No, Cal, Amy's crazy.

59:04.332 --> 59:05.916
Well, maybe he wants
to end it too.

59:07.335 --> 59:08.835
That's not your choice
to make, man.

59:08.836 --> 59:09.920
But it is.

59:12.507 --> 59:14.174
They're making it my choice.

59:14.175 --> 59:16.343
Cal, come on, I'm giving you
an opening here!

59:16.344 --> 59:17.344
Time.

59:17.345 --> 59:18.720
Okay, I choose...

59:18.721 --> 59:21.515
God, no, Cal. Don't do this.

59:21.516 --> 59:23.267
- Don't do that.
- You can't do this.

59:23.268 --> 59:27.020
No.

59:28.022 --> 59:30.274
It's murder.

59:30.275 --> 59:31.358
Don't look.

59:31.359 --> 59:33.735
Oh, Jesus.

59:42.370 --> 59:44.705
Nicely done.

59:57.343 --> 59:58.677
And now...

01:00:00.054 --> 01:00:01.722
On to the next round.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.058
It had to be done, right?

01:00:07.228 --> 01:00:09.062
Right?

01:00:09.063 --> 01:00:10.981
You didn't have to do that.

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:14.109
So how long would you say?

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.986
He may live for several
more hours, days even.

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:17.321
I don't know.

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:18.905
But he's in no shape
to continue play.

01:00:18.906 --> 01:00:20.282
That much is certain.

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:23.827
All right, let's move him out.

01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:27.914
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:29.416
I regret to inform you

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:32.044
that Travis is unable
to continue playing.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:33.378
Aww...

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.507
Do not do that.

01:00:37.508 --> 01:00:40.552
Keep your sarcasm to yourself.

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:51.980
I'm thinking...

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:54.650
We don't have much time here
with these delays.

01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:02.366
We have 21/2 hours left.

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:04.368
Is that enough for us to...

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:06.119
Can you run?

01:01:11.876 --> 01:01:12.959
Now!

01:01:29.977 --> 01:01:31.144
Iris, run.

01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:48.328
Get back!

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:56.211
All right,
everyone back to the table.

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:58.046
Get up. Everyone, get up.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:59.464
Julian, get up on your...

01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:03.802
Back to your seats.

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.095
Well...

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:08.181
That was some unexpected
excitement, wasn't it?

01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:09.349
Everyone sit down.

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:10.517
Where's Iris?

01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:11.852
- What?
- Iris!

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:14.020
Bevans!

01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:15.856
The door was unlocked?

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:18.692
Stay here! Keep an eye on them!

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:21.611
Bring her back to the game!

01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:22.654
I should help him.

01:02:22.655 --> 01:02:24.656
Fine, go, go.

01:02:24.657 --> 01:02:26.450
Remember what we spoke about.

01:02:28.786 --> 01:02:31.288
I believe I said sit down.

01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:58.518
Little pig tried to run away,
didn't she?

01:04:58.519 --> 01:05:00.353
What? You gonna go tell on us?

01:05:00.354 --> 01:05:03.273
Well, no one
is gonna believe you, okay?

01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:05.275
No one.

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:17.996
Iris.

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:20.165
Get back.

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:21.791
I'm getting you out of here.

01:05:21.792 --> 01:05:23.084
I made a mistake.

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:24.127
I should've just told...

01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:32.719
Shoot her, Bevans!

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.721
She attacked me!

01:05:41.812 --> 01:05:43.730
Your father
will be disappointed.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:47.067
After all she did,
she doesn't get punished?

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:48.902
I need to take her back
to the game.

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:53.156
Take him upstairs
and leave him there.

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:55.116
I'll inform his father.

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:59.412
I'm sorry, Iris,

01:05:59.413 --> 01:06:01.456
but we're not through playing.

01:06:17.598 --> 01:06:19.516
Welcome back, Iris.

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:24.646
Bevans, what took so long?

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:25.981
Where's Julian?

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.944
Your son tried to rape Iris.

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:32.028
- She...
- What?

01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:33.279
Stabbed him in the thigh.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.572
He's been taken upstairs, sir.

01:06:34.573 --> 01:06:37.075
Let me handle that.

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:39.953
Excuse me for a moment,
everyone.

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:43.581
Lock that behind me.

01:06:46.627 --> 01:06:47.961
Where's Cal?

01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:52.215
They shot him.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.517
You gonna be okay, Iris?

01:07:03.936 --> 01:07:05.770
Iris, talk to me.

01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:07.439
How far did you get?
Is there a way out?

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.024
Do you all get it now?

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.234
They're not gonna let us
just leave.

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:14.237
She's right.

01:07:14.238 --> 01:07:16.156
She's absolutely right.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:32.005
Iris...

01:07:34.967 --> 01:07:36.801
I am dreadfully sorry

01:07:36.802 --> 01:07:38.970
for what took place
in the basement.

01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:44.100
Since the loss of his mother,

01:07:44.101 --> 01:07:47.687
my son lacks...

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:51.566
Restraint.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:54.194
Well, please.

01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:59.657
My apologies.

01:07:59.658 --> 01:08:00.867
All right.

01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:02.786
Let's continue.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.205
That's it?

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:07.540
Why is this bitch allowed
to stay in the game?

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:10.710
You're lucky
you didn't get us all killed.

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:11.920
Crazy girl has a point.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.130
This is my game.

01:08:14.131 --> 01:08:16.131
I make the decisions here.

01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:19.219
Keep your petulant mouth shut.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.303
She will play.

01:08:20.304 --> 01:08:21.720
The game will continue.

01:08:22.723 --> 01:08:23.932
Final.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:24.974
Now...

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:29.687
My son, Julian,
is unable to continue.

01:08:29.688 --> 01:08:30.729
What a shame.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:32.941
Excuse me?

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:35.902
Thank you.

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:39.906
So on to the next round.

01:08:39.907 --> 01:08:42.908
Now,

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:44.577
when all of you were deciding

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:48.081
whether or not to accept
our invitation to play the game,

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:50.250
you were, in essence,
making a choice

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:53.419
between the known
and the unknown.

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:57.090
You could continue to deal
with your problems, the known,

01:08:57.091 --> 01:09:02.595
or possibly solve your problems
in the unknown,

01:09:02.595 --> 01:09:03.805
our game.

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:08.518
This round
uses that same concept.

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:23.950
What's this for?
Are you gonna let us clean up?

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:26.618
No, Peter. I'm sorry.

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:28.453
The barrel of water
is for the next round.

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:35.295
Envelopes are being placed
randomly in front of you.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:39.465
They each contain a card
with a punishment on them...

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.134
some of them quite harsh,

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:44.636
others relatively harmless.

01:09:44.638 --> 01:09:49.434
You must decide between
what lies inside the envelope

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.853
or the barrel.

01:09:53.647 --> 01:09:56.441
The known or the unknown.

01:09:57.776 --> 01:09:59.277
What's with the barrel?

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:00.904
Two minutes.

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:02.655
Two minutes held underwater.

01:10:02.656 --> 01:10:04.490
That's the barrel.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:10.163
And you will have 30 seconds
in this round

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:11.247
to make your decision.

01:10:11.248 --> 01:10:12.874
Let's begin, shall we?

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:13.875
Peter.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.627
Fuck.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.462
We will begin with you.

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:19.255
So what will it be?

01:10:20.507 --> 01:10:22.175
The barrel

01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:27.096
or what is in that envelope?

01:10:27.097 --> 01:10:29.557
Well, I already know
what I'm choosing.

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:32.018
Do you? Really?

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:33.686
Do tell.

01:10:33.687 --> 01:10:35.355
This is gambling 101
right here.

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:37.357
You just got to look
for the patterns.

01:10:37.358 --> 01:10:39.025
It's all patterns.
It's psychology.

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:44.447
And drowning
does sound pretty bad.

01:10:44.448 --> 01:10:48.117
So I'm guessing you think
I'm gonna choose the envelope

01:10:48.118 --> 01:10:49.786
to avoid Duggins
holding me underwater

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:51.120
for two minutes and drowning.

01:10:51.121 --> 01:10:52.956
Is that it?

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:54.165
Bevans.

01:10:54.166 --> 01:10:55.541
Whatever.

01:10:57.461 --> 01:10:58.878
If you were facing
a normal player,

01:10:58.879 --> 01:11:00.922
that's exactly what you'd do...

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:03.758
put something really shitty
in that envelope

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:07.178
so all the other players
think twice.

01:11:07.179 --> 01:11:08.513
But I know you.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:10.265
You've looked into my past.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:12.433
So you know all about
my gambling experience.

01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:15.687
So you probably
have anticipated

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:17.230
that I was gonna
figure this out.

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:19.065
Come on, come on, come on.
Make a decision.

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:20.233
Your time is running out.

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:22.193
The envelope.

01:11:22.194 --> 01:11:23.278
Obviously.

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:29.033
And the envelope says?

01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:37.000
What is this?

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:44.632
You have to light off
a firecracker in your hand.

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:45.800
That's it.

01:11:46.885 --> 01:11:48.386
Good.

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:52.265
See?

01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:55.476
Gambling 101.

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:56.769
Why are you
pointing a gun in my face?

01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:57.770
I'm agreeing to this.

01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:05.278
What the hell is this?

01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:06.779
You have to light it, Peter.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.614
It's what the envelope says.

01:12:08.615 --> 01:12:09.782
But it's not a firecracker.

01:12:09.783 --> 01:12:12.285
That's a quarter stick.

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:14.162
You know, you're right.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:15.872
Maybe you ought to move away
from the table.

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:17.373
You're gonna make an awful mess.

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:20.460
Let it go before it goes off.

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:21.627
Don't hold it too tight.

01:12:21.628 --> 01:12:23.629
No, he must hold it tight.

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:25.548
Bevans?

01:12:25.549 --> 01:12:28.259
Secure it to his hand,
if you would, please.

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:33.973
Oh, fuck.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.488
You know, Peter,
maybe it's a dud.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:49.864
Did you think about that?

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:51.407
Did you consider that?

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:53.993
But, of course,
we won't know that

01:12:53.994 --> 01:12:56.329
until you light the fuse.

01:12:58.665 --> 01:13:00.750
Use the lighter!

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:02.502
And light the fuse!

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:03.628
Now!

01:13:06.006 --> 01:13:08.049
If this is a dud,
do I have to go again?

01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:11.302
Nah.

01:13:22.272 --> 01:13:23.689
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:24.857
Oh, my God.

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:31.781
That was loud.

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:34.283
We're lucky
we didn't break any windows.

01:13:34.284 --> 01:13:36.202
Let's see what we have.

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.708
I think he's having
a heart attack, sir.

01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:43.793
Really?

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:48.089
Peter?

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.799
- Peter?
- Peter.

01:13:53.554 --> 01:13:54.887
Now he's dead.

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:02.937
Oh, well.

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:19.412
Lucas.

01:14:20.914 --> 01:14:21.998
It's your turn.

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:23.833
So what is it,

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:26.419
the barrel or the card?

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:29.422
What would you rather do?

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:35.428
Two minutes held underwater.

01:14:38.765 --> 01:14:40.892
I don't think I can do that.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:42.393
I don't think I can.

01:14:46.773 --> 01:14:48.774
We're running out of time here.

01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:51.777
No.

01:14:51.778 --> 01:14:53.946
I'll take my chances
with the card.

01:14:53.947 --> 01:14:55.448
Okay.

01:15:03.123 --> 01:15:04.582
What do we have?

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:11.172
What is it?

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:12.924
- Oh, well, that's...
- What...what is it?

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:14.884
This...this is...

01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:18.471
Is very interesting.

01:15:18.472 --> 01:15:21.474
You must...

01:15:23.143 --> 01:15:24.810
Slit open your eye.

01:15:26.104 --> 01:15:27.772
You can use this mirror,

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:29.482
if it helps.

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:30.650
No.

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:32.485
- That's it.
- That's it?

01:15:32.486 --> 01:15:34.987
No, that's not it.
No, I can't do this.

01:15:34.988 --> 01:15:36.656
- Lucas.
- I can't.

01:15:36.657 --> 01:15:38.783
You made your decision.

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:40.993
This is how the game is played.

01:15:40.994 --> 01:15:42.787
Pick up the razor blade.

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:46.999
Please.

01:15:50.128 --> 01:15:52.630
- Pick it up.
- Please don't.

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:54.257
You sick fuck!

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:56.342
I will give you...

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:58.678
30 seconds to do this.

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:01.681
I can't do that!

01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:03.516
30 seconds.

01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:05.351
I can't do it!

01:16:05.352 --> 01:16:07.353
- 30 seconds to do it...
- I can't do it.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:09.188
- Or Bevans...
- I can't do it!

01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:10.356
Will dispatch you.

01:16:10.357 --> 01:16:12.024
Do you understand?

01:16:12.025 --> 01:16:15.027
And by the way, you can pick
whichever eye you want.

01:16:15.028 --> 01:16:16.696
It's completely up to you.

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:18.364
Go.

01:16:27.207 --> 01:16:28.332
20 seconds.

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:29.375
Fuck!

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:36.424
I can't do it.

01:16:38.218 --> 01:16:40.136
10 seconds.

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:41.220
Listen, Lucas,

01:16:41.221 --> 01:16:43.264
he will eliminate you,

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:44.265
I am telling you.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:47.435
Five, four, three,

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:49.645
two, one.

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:54.984
There.

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:56.652
All done.

01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:03.909
Iris.

01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:06.203
Are you interested in seeing
what's in your envelope?

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:12.251
No.

01:17:12.252 --> 01:17:13.502
Oh, of course.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.922
You're not the gambling type,
are you?

01:17:16.923 --> 01:17:18.883
Oh, no, no, no.

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:21.260
No, you prefer the sure thing.

01:17:29.436 --> 01:17:30.603
Thank you.

01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:32.772
Lovely.

01:17:32.773 --> 01:17:34.106
So...

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.818
Two minutes, yes?

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:40.863
Go.

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:12.019
I keep having this dream

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.980
that I'm on a boat.

01:18:14.981 --> 01:18:17.149
Suddenly, the boat

01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:20.986
tips over and throws me
into the water.

01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:25.408
You and all these people
are pinned under it...

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.452
And you're drowning.

01:18:28.453 --> 01:18:30.454
Come on, come on.

01:18:30.455 --> 01:18:32.123
And I keep trying
to pull myself up,

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:33.833
but the more and more I do...

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:39.505
The more the boat
comes down with me.

01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:40.840
And you are trying
to grab my hand,

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.341
trying to help me,

01:18:42.342 --> 01:18:47.096
but we're sinking faster
and faster and faster until...

01:18:49.433 --> 01:18:51.016
I just finally...

01:18:59.359 --> 01:19:00.443
Yes!

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:02.528
Two minutes!

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.614
Iris!

01:19:05.615 --> 01:19:07.867
Very impressive.

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:09.285
You know,

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:12.455
this is designed
to actually drown people.

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:16.625
What was in her card?

01:19:18.378 --> 01:19:20.087
I have no idea.

01:19:21.381 --> 01:19:23.549
Find out.

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:25.676
Set of lungs.

01:19:35.395 --> 01:19:37.897
That was a close call, Iris.

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:40.149
All your teeth extracted.

01:19:41.651 --> 01:19:43.652
Sorry, Bevans, maybe next year.

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:47.239
Is Amy ready?

01:19:50.243 --> 01:19:53.245
So how long
can you hold your breath, Amy?

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:58.125
How long did it
take your husband

01:19:58.126 --> 01:20:00.795
to hold your little girl

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:02.129
while he drowned her?

01:20:12.265 --> 01:20:14.225
What is this?

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:17.019
It's another barrel,

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:18.354
with a four.

01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:19.980
And that four stands for...

01:20:21.775 --> 01:20:23.692
Four minutes.

01:20:23.693 --> 01:20:24.860
That isn't possible.

01:20:24.861 --> 01:20:26.862
No, technically,
it is possible.

01:20:26.863 --> 01:20:29.365
Not even close to
the world record, by the way.

01:20:35.288 --> 01:20:38.624
Well, I guess...

01:20:38.625 --> 01:20:40.793
beggars can't be choosers.

01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:46.298
I guess so.

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:54.139
Four minutes.

01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:56.392
Ready, Bevans?

01:20:58.937 --> 01:21:00.521
Go.

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:01.814
She wasn't ready!

01:21:56.786 --> 01:21:59.204
At the beginning of the night,

01:21:59.205 --> 01:22:02.875
I would have pegged her
as the odds-on favorite to win.

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:03.959
You never know, sir.

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:14.678
And then there were two.

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:21.769
Iris, I would like for you
to sit across from Lucas,

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:23.103
if you would, please.

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:28.442
Thank you.

01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:45.000
We're in the final stretch now.

01:22:47.253 --> 01:22:49.672
Now...

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:51.507
Before we begin
the final round,

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:54.510
I'd like to say a few words,
if I may.

01:22:55.762 --> 01:23:00.432
I know that this evening
has been difficult.

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:03.060
For all of us, really.

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:07.898
But it has also been one
for the books.

01:23:07.899 --> 01:23:10.109
And I speak not only for myself

01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:13.570
but for Bevans and his staff
and the entire Lambrick family

01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:15.155
when I say,

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:17.825
well played, both of you.

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:21.829
Personally, I'd be happy
if either one of you won.

01:23:23.248 --> 01:23:24.915
Truly.

01:23:28.753 --> 01:23:32.673
To the final round, then.

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:36.260
Now, in all likelihood,

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:37.636
the game will end

01:23:37.637 --> 01:23:40.305
with the very first question
in this round.

01:23:40.306 --> 01:23:43.308
We have found
that the player who goes first

01:23:43.309 --> 01:23:44.810
in the final round

01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:49.356
has a decided advantage.

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:53.527
Therefore, we will flip a coin.

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:56.155
Bevans.

01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:58.824
Heads, Iris.

01:23:58.825 --> 01:24:00.492
Tails, Lucas.

01:24:00.493 --> 01:24:01.994
Bevans, if you would, please.

01:24:12.088 --> 01:24:14.548
Heads it is.

01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:18.260
Iris...

01:24:18.261 --> 01:24:19.553
you're up.

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:24.141
The final question.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:29.480
Would you rather,

01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:32.232
A...

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:34.568
end the game right now,

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:40.074
you and Lucas free to leave,

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.034
empty-handed

01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:43.494
but alive.

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:48.582
Or B...

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:53.670
With this dueling pistol

01:24:53.671 --> 01:24:56.131
with a single round
in its chamber...

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:04.973
Eliminate Lucas,

01:25:04.974 --> 01:25:07.184
claim victory

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:09.853
and salvation for your brother.

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:16.110
Which?

01:25:18.863 --> 01:25:20.531
Iris.

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:23.242
Iris.

01:25:24.244 --> 01:25:25.452
It's over.

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:28.831
We're done. We can...

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:31.083
We can go home.

01:25:38.758 --> 01:25:40.425
Iris,

01:25:40.426 --> 01:25:42.719
I never told you why

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.138
I came here tonight.

01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:47.474
I think you should hear it,
okay?

01:25:52.605 --> 01:25:54.273
I think we have
some things in common.

01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:57.651
You're here for someone else,
right?

01:25:59.362 --> 01:26:00.529
Your brother.

01:26:02.448 --> 01:26:05.284
I'll bet you'd do anything
for him.

01:26:05.285 --> 01:26:07.619
I know exactly how you feel.

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:08.787
I have three sisters...

01:26:25.471 --> 01:26:28.307
We have a winner.

01:26:33.062 --> 01:26:34.521
Brava!

01:26:36.232 --> 01:26:37.608
Bravo!

01:26:45.825 --> 01:26:46.992
Bravo!

01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:03.342
This is yours.

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:07.429
There should be enough in there
to cover any debts

01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:09.806
that your parents
left behind you,

01:27:09.807 --> 01:27:12.100
plus enough for you
to go back to school.

01:27:14.854 --> 01:27:19.524
We had previously located
a suitable donor in Romania.

01:27:19.525 --> 01:27:22.527
Arrangements are already
being made as we speak,

01:27:22.528 --> 01:27:24.529
and your brother will be
undergoing the procedure

01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:26.365
before the week is out.

01:27:26.366 --> 01:27:28.867
You see?

01:27:28.868 --> 01:27:30.202
We keep our word.

01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:38.126
I believe a "thank you"
is in order.

01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:44.883
Thank you, Mr. Lambrick.

01:27:44.884 --> 01:27:47.219
Oh, please.

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.304
No, no, no, call me Shep.

01:29:55.139 --> 01:29:57.265
Raleigh.

01:29:57.266 --> 01:29:58.683
Oh, my God.

01:29:58.684 --> 01:30:01.645
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:02.854
What did you do?

01:30:02.855 --> 01:30:04.981
What did you do?

01:30:04.982 --> 01:30:07.150
Oh, my God.

01:30:07.151 --> 01:30:09.569
What did you do?

01:30:10.305 --> 01:30:16.470
