13:35.597 --> 13:37.555
Claire.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.913

-Come on.
-I'm up, I'm up, I'm up...

14:31.479 --> 14:33.916
I was up all night
and I had a revelation.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.396
-You did? What is it?
-Yeah.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.746
We aren't going anywhere.

14:37.789 --> 14:39.095
-We're not?
-No.

14:39.139 --> 14:41.097
-We're not?
-No, because we're in LA.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.969
It's like
the land of, of movie stars

14:43.012 --> 14:44.884
and fancy cars, you know?

14:44.927 --> 14:46.798
There's like five places alone
on this block

14:46.842 --> 14:48.931
where you can get kombucha.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.715
What's that? What is kombucha?

14:50.759 --> 14:53.022
I don't even know.
A-and that's my point.

14:53.066 --> 14:55.024
You know, 'cause if
we're gonna be LA-ians,

14:55.068 --> 14:57.679
we-we gotta,
we gotta adapt, right?

14:57.722 --> 14:59.811
Yeah, yes, yes, I do know,

14:59.855 --> 15:02.771
what you, like a, mm,
like an adaptation.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.991
Yes, and we-we're,
we're not just gonna run away

15:05.034 --> 15:07.863
because some idiots wanna spill
their guts in our bathtub.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.910
No, no. This is our dream,
this is our destiny.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.390
Yes, I don't wanna run, Claire.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.958
I'm, I'm... Like you always say,
I'm lazy.

15:16.002 --> 15:19.179
We are strong
and we are, we are adaptable

15:19.222 --> 15:22.051
and we are,
we are Los Angelenos.

-I love you, too.

-I love you, Claire.
-[chuckles]

-Oh, no.

[car engine rumbling]

15:34.237 --> 15:37.675
Claire, this meeting started
15 minutes ago.

15:37.719 --> 15:41.636
I am so sorry, some guy broke
into our apartment last night

15:41.679 --> 15:43.333
and then committed suicide
in the bathtub.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.987
I-I think he was like,
part of some cult.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.336
The cult of Storsh.

15:46.380 --> 15:49.035
You're living in
the Tabula Building? Why?

15:49.078 --> 15:51.254
Great location,
it's close to freeways.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.996
Moving on. Meegan Nordheim.

15:54.040 --> 15:58.000
You all know her, star
of the reality show Meal Ticket,

15:58.044 --> 15:59.915
stands to inherit
half a billion dollars

15:59.959 --> 16:02.918
from insecticide king,
Armund Nordheim,

16:02.962 --> 16:06.095
who is currently 96 years old

16:06.139 --> 16:08.141
and counting.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.795
And she is now
running for congress

16:10.839 --> 16:12.841
because that's a thing now.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.364
The woman's a monster.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.366
Yeah. She wants an increase
in kill shelters.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.455
I mean, who campaigns
on killing puppies?

16:18.499 --> 16:21.023
She's retained us at the rate of
50,000 a month.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.025
-She has my full support.
-Our country needs her.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.027
Yeah, well, she was up
in the polls as of last night,

16:25.071 --> 16:27.247
but all that's gonna change
because this morning

16:27.290 --> 16:31.164
the Los Angeles Tatlerran
this series of paparazzi photos

16:31.207 --> 16:34.471
showing Ms. Nordheim
enjoying the company

16:34.515 --> 16:39.433
of 20-year-old personal trainer
slash actor, Dake Wharton.

16:39.476 --> 16:42.740
-Oh, my God.
-Is that a squash?

16:42.784 --> 16:45.091
Look, this one's easy. It's a
classic redirect.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.354
She repents, goes to church
every Sunday,

16:47.397 --> 16:51.053
does a couple of guest sermons,
talks about rebirth through God.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.446
Somethin' there. Tony.

16:52.489 --> 16:53.795
[Tony] I mean, I say,
we blame the dude.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.666
Nordheim
was manipulated

16:55.710 --> 16:59.757
by some Hollywood pretty boy
who preys on middle-aged women

16:59.801 --> 17:01.629
in order to extort money
for sex.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.413
Okay, she is the victim here.

17:05.894 --> 17:10.290
-Claire?
-Uh... Um...

17:10.333 --> 17:12.944

17:14.729 --> 17:18.472
Ben Barnes, he drew private
parts on my notebook,

17:18.515 --> 17:20.430
but I-I put stickers
over top of them

17:20.473 --> 17:21.866
and I turned them into unicorn.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.260
I actually still have it,
it's kinda cool.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.742
[chuckles]

17:30.005 --> 17:31.354
[Pearl] Moving on.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.270
[traffic bustling]

17:40.102 --> 17:41.451
[panting]

17:41.495 --> 17:42.496
[grunting]

17:47.892 --> 17:50.678
-Do you yield?
-No.

17:50.721 --> 17:51.766
W-wh-what's your book?

17:51.809 --> 17:53.985
I'm not, I'm not part of this.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.813
You're not here
to use the bathtub?

17:55.857 --> 17:57.119
No, well, I mean,
I use the bathtub.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.990
-It's my apartment.
-You live here?

17:59.034 --> 18:00.818
That's, that's disgusting.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.646
This is our house.
Me and Claire.

18:02.690 --> 18:03.778
Get out, get out.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.997
[intense music]

18:17.357 --> 18:19.141
Oh, hello, Barry.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.230
Danielle, you're looking well.

18:21.274 --> 18:24.233
Please spare me
the pleasantries.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.017
[Danielle] Do you yield?

18:26.061 --> 18:30.152
I do not!

18:30.196 --> 18:32.459
-What's your book?
-The honorable Robert Perkins.

18:32.502 --> 18:35.244
[Danielle] The book
of the honorable Robert Perkins.

18:35.288 --> 18:38.552
I choose verse 60!

18:38.595 --> 18:40.119
[Danielle and Barry]
"Despite having shown

18:40.162 --> 18:41.859
no remorse for these brutal

18:41.903 --> 18:45.385
and cold-blooded murders,
it is my regret that the state

18:45.428 --> 18:48.953
must refile these charges
due to improper warrant

18:48.997 --> 18:52.348
for the search and seizure of
evidence relating to the murder

18:52.392 --> 18:54.263
of Ms. Elizabeth Watson!"

18:54.307 --> 18:56.831
-Watkins!
-[Barry] No!

18:56.874 --> 18:58.311
Watkins!

18:58.354 --> 19:00.356
It's kins! Dammit!

19:00.400 --> 19:04.534
Who knows the book?
I know the book, Barry!

19:04.578 --> 19:06.536
I can tell you this.

19:06.580 --> 19:08.059
This is not over.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.150
Now that is how it's done.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.499
What w-was that?

19:12.542 --> 19:13.804
The challenge,

19:13.848 --> 19:17.373
and next talent.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.550
What I Did Over Spring Break
by Danielle Carter.

19:20.594 --> 19:24.641
"This summer, my mom and
step-dad took us all to Denmark.

19:24.685 --> 19:28.036
We went to Legoland
and it was really cool.

19:28.079 --> 19:31.039
There was a giant dragon
made from Legos

19:31.082 --> 19:34.216
and they serve vanilla pudding
in the cafeteria.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.524
My favorite thing about Legoland
was the hotel.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.179
The bed was made
from giant Legos

19:40.222 --> 19:43.269
and, uh, they serve pancakes
for breakfast.

19:43.312 --> 19:46.010
In conclusion,
Legoland is a very good place

19:46.054 --> 19:47.925
to go for your spring vacation.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.145
I recommend it highly

19:50.189 --> 19:52.539
for friends and family alike."

19:52.582 --> 19:55.106
That's great, that's,
seriously, that's a,

19:55.150 --> 19:57.283
that's a really nice
piece of writing.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.154
Oh, I did... I got an A on it.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.852
-Did you? Oh.
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

20:01.896 --> 20:06.553
Oh, well. Time for me to achieve
eternal bliss. [chuckles]

20:06.596 --> 20:07.771
[water gurgling]

20:09.643 --> 20:11.993
Oh, shit!

20:12.036 --> 20:13.386
I forgot my knife.
Do you have a knife?

20:13.429 --> 20:15.301
-A knife to kill yourself with?
-Yeah, yeah.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.041
Well, I'm not gonna,
I don't want your blood and guts

20:17.085 --> 20:18.391
all over one of my knives.
That's gross.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.044
That's what dishwashers are for.

20:20.088 --> 20:21.307
Then I'm gonna think about what

20:21.350 --> 20:22.656
you did with it
every time I use it.

20:22.699 --> 20:23.787
Well, just put it in

20:23.831 --> 20:25.049
amongst all the other knives

20:25.093 --> 20:26.616
and then
you wouldn't even remember.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.183
Then I-I'm gonna think about
that with all my knives.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.837
Well, th-throw it away then.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.665
So now I'm giving you a knife?

20:31.708 --> 20:34.711
No. Is there anything else
I can provide you with?

20:34.755 --> 20:38.541
Maybe like a spoon
to scoop your eyeballs out

20:38.585 --> 20:41.544
or maybe a cheese grater
to shave off your nipples?

20:41.588 --> 20:44.243
Jesus! I don't appreciate
this kind of talk.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.245
Well, I don't appreciate
a complete stranger

20:46.288 --> 20:50.118
doing a suicide
in my bathtub. Ah!

20:50.161 --> 20:52.033
We haven't unpacked
the knives yet.

20:52.076 --> 20:55.079
But you do have a screwdriver!

20:55.123 --> 20:58.126
No! No!

-Oh, right in the spine.
-Oh, my God!

21:16.884 --> 21:18.233
Why did you shove her
like that?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.670
-She was attacking you!
-No, she was...

21:20.714 --> 21:22.455
She was trying to kill herself!
She's a cult member.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.067
Stop screaming!

-Oh, God.
-Ah!

21:40.777 --> 21:43.345
He's never gonna believe us.

21:43.389 --> 21:47.088
-Who?
-Th-that Detective Cartwright.

21:47.131 --> 21:48.350
-He's never gonna believe us.
-Why?

21:48.394 --> 21:50.047
-Why wouldn't he believe us?
-Uh...

21:50.091 --> 21:52.398
Uh, look around.
I mean... [stammers]

21:52.441 --> 21:55.226
The screwdriver in her back and
there's blood on the wall and--

21:55.270 --> 21:57.707
-Oh, my God! You're right!
-Oh, God!

21:57.751 --> 22:00.188
You're right!
What, what are we gonna do?

22:00.231 --> 22:01.494
-Tell us what to do, Claire!
-I don't know.

22:01.537 --> 22:02.712
-Tell us what to do!
-I don't know!

22:02.756 --> 22:03.800
Just let me think, let me think,

22:03.844 --> 22:05.324
let me think, please.

22:06.673 --> 22:09.589
[dramatic music]

22:11.417 --> 22:12.679
Change the story.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.161
-[camera clicks]
-[indistinct radio chatter]

22:18.685 --> 22:21.252
This is how we found her.

22:21.296 --> 22:24.212
Yeah, she totally committed
self-murder in the bathtub.

22:24.255 --> 22:28.999
She stabbed herself in the back?

22:29.043 --> 22:31.567
I know. Right?

22:31.611 --> 22:34.222
This is the sloppiest tub death
I've ever seen.

22:34.265 --> 22:35.963
Yeah, 'cause how many times
do you get to practice

22:36.006 --> 22:38.226
your own suicide?

22:38.269 --> 22:40.184
Yes, that's actually
a good point.

22:40.228 --> 22:41.795
-'Cause he gets, he gets...
-Just in one shot.

22:41.838 --> 22:42.883
Yeah.

[laughing]

22:44.058 --> 22:46.234
[indistinct chatter]

22:46.277 --> 22:49.106
Here comes Wallace on the
comedy bus five minutes late.

22:49.150 --> 22:50.325
That's how humor works.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.718
It's an involuntary reaction

22:51.761 --> 22:52.719
when you find something funny.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.198
You can't fake it after you hear

22:54.242 --> 22:56.375
two people laughing, you child.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.292
[instrumental music]

23:05.427 --> 23:07.690
You've been unpacking.

23:07.734 --> 23:10.345
You kids planning on staying?

23:10.389 --> 23:12.347
Yeah, uh, you know,
it's a great location,

23:12.391 --> 23:14.523
it's close to freeways.

23:14.567 --> 23:17.178
Really?

23:17.221 --> 23:19.833
Y-you know, that really shows
some backbone.

23:19.876 --> 23:23.706
To be honest, a lot of the
people just leave right away.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.665
That's good.
Y-you're gonna like it.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.362
There is a, um...

23:27.406 --> 23:30.670
There is a nice pizza place
about three blocks up

23:30.713 --> 23:32.193
called Schneider's

23:32.236 --> 23:34.935
and they have a two-for-one deal

23:34.978 --> 23:37.851
where you get a can of Pepsi
for free on weekdays.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.896
I don't know if you guys, uh,

23:39.940 --> 23:42.856
like pizza. Everybody does.

23:42.899 --> 23:45.467
-[Paul] O-oh.
-Oh, you...

23:45.511 --> 23:48.818
Yeah, I... Well, we...
I have to, I have to work.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.038
[stammers] I don't know
why you're telling me that.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.692
I have work, too.
Everyone has work.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.172
That's... Uh, why are you
telling me you have work?

23:55.216 --> 23:56.739
-Is it non sequitur?
-Oh, no, I didn't mean--

23:56.783 --> 23:59.350
'Cause I wasn't asking you guys
to hang out with me.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.004
-I'm a police officer.
-Oh, of course.

24:01.048 --> 24:03.442
I'm a detective. I, I work.

24:03.485 --> 24:04.921
Oh, no, I didn't mean--

24:04.965 --> 24:06.967
The job's frankly all I got.
[chuckles]

24:07.010 --> 24:10.579
It's, uh... Which is probably
why I caught Storsh.

24:10.623 --> 24:12.407
He did not get away from me.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.497
He got away from a department
with its head up its ass.

24:15.541 --> 24:18.848
I was not the one
asleep at the switch.

24:18.892 --> 24:21.372
[Claire] You know,
this Storsh character,

24:21.416 --> 24:24.680
i-it's like, a lot of the stuff
in this book makes sense.

24:24.724 --> 24:26.508
You know, I mean,
some of it's crazy, obviously,

24:26.552 --> 24:29.685
but some of it isn't.
Like, okay, for example...

24:29.729 --> 24:32.514
One of the things is being
the best you you can be.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.733
Well, I don't see
anything wrong with being

24:33.776 --> 24:34.908
the best you I can be.

24:34.951 --> 24:37.127
No, the best you youcan be.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.130
That's what I said.

24:40.174 --> 24:41.784
Okay. Um...

24:41.828 --> 24:43.525
For example,
here's another really good one.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.266
Uh... Oh, here. Listen to this.

24:45.309 --> 24:48.182
"When one liberates oneself from
the shackles of overthought,

24:48.225 --> 24:49.966
life can truly be free.

24:50.010 --> 24:52.534
Open yourself to your inner will
and close the door

24:52.578 --> 24:54.623
on the addiction
to outside approval."

24:54.667 --> 24:58.584
I mean, this is me at work.
I totally relate to this.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.673
Like, I'm always worried about
what other people are thinking.

25:00.716 --> 25:01.978
I don't even know
what I'm thinking.

25:02.022 --> 25:04.111
This stuff really makes sense.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.768
You know, I'm not smart
like you are, Claire.

25:08.811 --> 25:10.552
Oh, Paul.

25:10.596 --> 25:14.164
But I don't have to be smart
because I've got you.

25:14.208 --> 25:16.950
And-and now that we're casting
off the shackles of overthought,

25:16.993 --> 25:19.300
I swear my most deepest swear

25:19.343 --> 25:21.215
that I'm gonna get a job,

25:21.258 --> 25:23.696
like, as soon as possible.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.568
New city, new Paul, new us.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.657
-Oh, Paul.
-[grunting]

25:28.701 --> 25:30.703
-I believe in you.
-Oh.

25:30.746 --> 25:32.531
-I believe in you.
-Yeah?

25:33.619 --> 25:36.360
Oh, I love you, my Claire.

25:36.404 --> 25:39.276
[upbeat music]

25:45.413 --> 25:48.242
Claire, Claire, hi.
So we just got the call.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.331
Nordheim is coming in to see
what we have for the campaign.

25:50.374 --> 25:51.680
-Now?
-Yeah, now.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.815
Ah. [grunts]

25:57.773 --> 25:59.688
[groaning]

26:03.605 --> 26:06.521
We weren't expecting
Mr. Nordheim.

26:09.437 --> 26:11.134
-[grunting]
-Oh...

26:15.443 --> 26:18.707
Well, we were thinking,

26:18.751 --> 26:22.798
what if you were to repent.

26:22.842 --> 26:24.017
The religious angle.

26:24.060 --> 26:26.672
-You find Jesus.
-I'm Jewish.

26:26.715 --> 26:30.066
Obviously you did a workup on me
and you already know that.

26:32.112 --> 26:34.810
[snaps finger] Okay.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.464
We put a story in the paper

26:36.507 --> 26:39.554
that the young man
with whom you had relations

26:39.598 --> 26:42.383
is actually a con artist

26:42.426 --> 26:44.559
preying on...

26:49.172 --> 26:50.434
Preying on?

26:51.610 --> 26:53.002
Praying...

26:55.091 --> 26:57.398
Tony, why don't you take
this one since it's your idea?

26:58.965 --> 27:02.446
Sure. Uh... [chuckles]

27:02.490 --> 27:07.190
Um, uh... I see sort of like a,
uh,

27:07.234 --> 27:09.453
a basketball player,
but instead of legs,

27:09.497 --> 27:13.544
um, it's got tang threads.
So, like a ro...

27:13.588 --> 27:15.459
Ro... [clears throat]

27:17.766 --> 27:20.595
Okay, I'm gonna speak now.

27:20.639 --> 27:24.425
I am not impressed
with any of this.

27:24.468 --> 27:26.340
And if this is all you have,
I'm going to be

27:26.383 --> 27:30.213
very, very, very disappointed.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.785
I have an idea.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.358
[exhales]

27:51.452 --> 27:54.281
[Paul] What exactly would
you say your strengths are?

27:54.324 --> 27:57.806
Well, uh, first and foremost,
I am a people-pleaser.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.939
-Pe-people like me.
-Well, I don't like you.

27:59.982 --> 28:03.116
And I have a hard time
seeing how anyone would.

28:03.159 --> 28:04.726
Please, just, sir,
just give me a chance.

28:04.770 --> 28:07.511
Do you even know
what it is we do here?

28:07.555 --> 28:10.514
Y-y-you guys design
roller coasters, right?

28:10.558 --> 28:12.299
Well, you managed
to get that right.

28:12.342 --> 28:15.606
How many years of mechanical
engineering do you have?

28:15.650 --> 28:17.565
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
Listen.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.306
Listen, I really need this job.

28:19.349 --> 28:20.960
My girlfriend said that
I-I have to get my job thing

28:21.003 --> 28:22.135
sorted or we can never
get married.

28:22.178 --> 28:24.354
-Uh! Your girlfriend?
-Yeah.

28:24.398 --> 28:27.227
You're in here wasting my time
because of your girlfriend?

28:27.270 --> 28:28.358
-No, no, please--
-I'm shocked...

28:28.402 --> 28:30.578
You even have a girlfriend.

28:30.621 --> 28:31.927
I wouldn't be surprised
if she leaves you

28:31.971 --> 28:33.712
by the end of the week because

28:33.755 --> 28:36.584
there is no job for you here

28:36.627 --> 28:38.717
or anywhere in this city.

28:40.066 --> 28:42.285
-No...
-Now get out of my office!

28:42.329 --> 28:44.331
[sobbing softly]

28:46.942 --> 28:47.987
[grunts]

28:49.336 --> 28:51.425
[breathing heavily]

28:53.122 --> 28:56.038
[bird humming]

29:00.434 --> 29:03.524
Hi, Paul. Why so glumy, chummy?

29:09.530 --> 29:11.358
I can't get a job.

29:12.838 --> 29:15.797
No one will hire me.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.234
Uh, not after what happened
in Ohio.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.541
What's the what in Ohio, huh?

29:24.850 --> 29:26.242
[Claire] Okay.

29:26.286 --> 29:28.549
Did you know
that in 33% of marriages

29:28.592 --> 29:30.029
somebody commits infidelity?

29:30.072 --> 29:32.901
And that's only the ones
who admitted, so...

29:32.945 --> 29:36.078
So you were caught having
a little fun on the side.

29:36.122 --> 29:39.081
I'm sure every woman in America
would understand

29:39.125 --> 29:41.692
if you just put it into context.
Yeah.

29:41.736 --> 29:44.565
What context is that?

29:44.608 --> 29:46.132
Let's break the shackles
of approval

29:46.175 --> 29:50.484
and show everyone
it's okay to be the real you.

29:50.527 --> 29:52.616
I made this thing. It's a...

29:52.660 --> 29:54.531
Really, a-all you need to do is

29:54.575 --> 29:58.144
show these, these two pictures
side-by-side

29:58.187 --> 30:00.537
and then simply ask...

30:03.062 --> 30:05.238
"Come on. Wouldn't you?"

30:09.416 --> 30:12.549
"Come on. Wouldn't you?"

30:13.812 --> 30:16.205
Come on. Wouldn't you?

30:19.905 --> 30:21.297
Come on.

30:23.517 --> 30:26.912
Wouldn't you?
[laughing] I mean...

30:27.956 --> 30:30.002
Come on. Come on!

30:30.045 --> 30:32.831
[laughing]

30:34.310 --> 30:36.051
Come on. Wouldn't you?

30:36.095 --> 30:38.662
-Come on. Wouldn't you?
-Come on. Wouldn't you?

30:38.706 --> 30:40.142
[Meegan] Come on. Wouldn't you?
-Come on. Wouldn't you?

30:40.186 --> 30:42.666
-Come on. Wouldn't you?
-Come on. Wouldn't you?

30:42.710 --> 30:44.538
♪ Come on wouldn't you? Hey

30:44.581 --> 30:46.279

30:55.941 --> 30:58.160
♪ Oh come on wouldn't you?
Hey ♪

31:01.860 --> 31:04.340
This one time last year...

31:04.384 --> 31:07.909
I stayed up really late to watch
The Storage Warsmarathon.

31:07.953 --> 31:10.520
It's a really awesome show
because I like stuff

31:10.564 --> 31:12.914
about storage units.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.785
Anyway, I was gonna go to bed,
but then I remembered

31:14.829 --> 31:16.352
that Claire had asked me
to do the laundry,

31:16.396 --> 31:17.876
so I stayed up
for the rest of the night

31:17.919 --> 31:19.921
and did the laundry.

31:19.965 --> 31:22.097
Um, but then, then,

31:22.141 --> 31:23.490
the-the dryer didn't finish
in time,

31:23.533 --> 31:25.013
and I had to go to my job

31:25.057 --> 31:28.016
at the water filtration plant.

31:28.060 --> 31:31.759
And so I just wore
my uniform damp.

31:31.802 --> 31:36.111
But then on my walk to work, um,
I got really, really cold.

31:38.026 --> 31:41.334
And I couldn't stop shivering,
so I stopped at the gas station

31:41.377 --> 31:43.945
and got a Mountain Dew.

31:43.989 --> 31:47.035
And when I got to work, I tried
to heat the Mountain,

31:47.079 --> 31:50.386
Mountain Dew up on a hot plate.

31:50.430 --> 31:52.649
But then the plastic melted

31:52.693 --> 31:56.566
and-and, and then the melted
plastic and the Mountain Dew

31:56.610 --> 31:57.959
got all over my hands

31:58.003 --> 32:01.963
and I knocked over
a can of turpentine

32:02.007 --> 32:03.573
and that mixed
with some oldie peanuts

32:03.617 --> 32:06.185
and then that dripped
into the filtration fluids.

32:06.228 --> 32:10.667
[sniffles] And then the,
the melty Mountain-Dewie plastic

32:10.711 --> 32:13.714
and the, and the mold
and the turpentine

32:13.757 --> 32:16.717
all mixed together and made
some w-weird chemical reaction

32:16.760 --> 32:21.330
and-and then that... that got
into the town's water supply.

32:23.071 --> 32:26.901
[sobbing] And the entire town
lost their hair.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.731
All their hair.

32:30.774 --> 32:33.864
Their arms and their legs
and their eyebrows.

32:33.908 --> 32:38.608
And then... and then
about half the town,

32:38.652 --> 32:40.915
let's say, about 80,000 people,

32:40.959 --> 32:43.874
got rage madness and they
started foaming at the mouth

32:43.918 --> 32:46.051
and attacking each other
for no reason.

32:46.094 --> 32:49.271
And then the whole town
became a war zone.

32:49.315 --> 32:52.318
And we had to stay inside,
but everybody got so hungry.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.450
But then the rage people
stole all the food

32:54.494 --> 32:57.018
and they, they hid it
in a used tire yard.

32:57.062 --> 33:01.457
And they built this massive fort
out of used tires.

33:01.501 --> 33:04.330
It was like a beehive,
and then they stayed in,

33:04.373 --> 33:06.201
in the tire hive
and they wouldn't come out.

33:06.245 --> 33:07.811
And so then all the [stammering]

33:07.855 --> 33:09.639
then the normal people
burned down the tire hive.

33:09.683 --> 33:12.555
But then the fire,
the fire burned for months

33:12.599 --> 33:15.689
because it was just
millions of used tires.

33:15.732 --> 33:17.734
[sobbing] And then
we all had to go to the woods

33:17.778 --> 33:19.345
and hunt for animals.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.347
But it was the summer
and, and it was so hot

33:21.390 --> 33:24.132
and we all took off
all of our, our clothes

33:24.176 --> 33:26.265
and then we ran out of bullets.

33:26.308 --> 33:29.616
And so there's just a bunch
of hairless naked people

33:29.659 --> 33:32.880
running around the woods,
hunting for deer

33:32.923 --> 33:36.231
and raccoons and squirrels
with our bare hands.

33:36.275 --> 33:39.234
And then, t-then everyone

33:39.278 --> 33:42.672
got really hungry again
'cause we ran out of animals.

33:42.716 --> 33:47.068
And then... then you couldn't
tell the normal people

33:47.112 --> 33:48.852
from the rage people

33:48.896 --> 33:51.681
and-and you couldn't tell
who was who.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.292
And then a militia came
from another state

33:53.335 --> 33:55.337
and they called us all
s-skinners

33:55.381 --> 33:58.166
and th-they hunted us for sport.

33:58.210 --> 34:01.387
And then the National Guard
came to fight the militia

34:01.430 --> 34:04.085
and then the government
sent in the army

34:04.129 --> 34:06.479
[sobbing] to rescue us all

34:06.522 --> 34:09.525
and then when it was all done...

34:09.569 --> 34:12.353
they told me I couldn't go back
to Ohio anymore.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.966
[sobbing]

34:18.404 --> 34:20.232
Oh, Paul.

34:20.275 --> 34:22.755
Sounds like you've been
on quite the journey.

34:22.799 --> 34:24.409
But your true journey of bliss

34:24.453 --> 34:26.498
found
on the instantaneous eternity

34:26.542 --> 34:29.415
only begins
when you change your story.

34:29.458 --> 34:32.373
It's time to loose the Os
in Ohio

34:32.418 --> 34:34.942
and say hito the new Paul,

34:34.985 --> 34:38.989
a Paul who's his own boss,
a Paul who answers to Paul.

34:39.033 --> 34:40.513
To-to me?

34:40.556 --> 34:42.123
[Bird] It's like
the Book Of Storiessays.

34:42.167 --> 34:45.518
The only thing you've to worry
about is what you think.

34:45.561 --> 34:48.303
If there's no job for you,
make your own job.

34:48.347 --> 34:52.264
Be like me. Be free.
Free like a bird, bird.

34:53.178 --> 34:56.398
Free? Like a bird, bird?

34:56.442 --> 34:57.704
[birds chirping]

34:57.747 --> 34:59.749
[whispers] Like a bird, bird.

35:00.663 --> 35:01.838
Yeah.

35:08.976 --> 35:10.282
-[doorknob rattles]
-[Claire] Hey-hey!

35:10.325 --> 35:13.067
-Hey!
-I had the best day.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.851
Me, too.
I had, I have huge news.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.114
Oh, okay. You first.

35:16.157 --> 35:17.767
So I-I slammed the door

35:17.811 --> 35:19.160
on the jackals of over-thoughts.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.683
Just like you said,
I've been so worried

35:20.727 --> 35:22.076
about what everyone else thinks
I should be

35:22.120 --> 35:24.078
that I forgot what I want to be.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.906
Oh, well, that-that's amazing.
What do you wanna be, Paul?

35:25.949 --> 35:28.169
A bird housemaker.

35:28.213 --> 35:30.606
I make birdhouses now.

35:30.650 --> 35:32.695
Come, come, come.

35:32.739 --> 35:35.307
Oh, wow!
You, you made all of these?

35:35.350 --> 35:36.917
Yeah, I'm in the zone.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.919
Look, so this one's
a little pool house, right?

35:38.962 --> 35:40.747
And it's got a little lounge
chair, a little changing room

35:40.790 --> 35:42.531
where the birds can change
out of their red clothes.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.185
A simple
mother-daughter apartment

35:44.229 --> 35:46.013
for when mom gets really old
and she could die,

35:46.056 --> 35:47.493
she could die at any moment.

35:47.536 --> 35:48.711
There's a little
mechanical chair

35:48.755 --> 35:50.191
that goes up and down the
stairs.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.714
This one is modelled
after Chuck E. Cheese,

35:51.758 --> 35:53.368
but I call it Chick E. Cheese.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.196
And there's a little bosspit.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.155
And there's a fake band and then
this one is a honeymoon suite,

35:57.198 --> 36:01.202
it's got a, um, a heart-shaped
bed for getting it on.

36:01.246 --> 36:05.598
Oh, look.
Claire, I almost forgot.

36:05.641 --> 36:08.253
This one's for you.

36:08.296 --> 36:10.994
It's an exact replica scale

36:11.038 --> 36:13.171
of the Full Houseliving room,
season one.

36:13.214 --> 36:16.565
Paul, this is, this is amazing!

36:16.609 --> 36:18.045
You don't have to say that.

36:18.088 --> 36:21.570
No, Paul. No.
I-I'm really proud of you.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.747
-Mm.
-Thank you.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.229
-Tell me about your day!
-Oh--

36:28.273 --> 36:30.144
I can't believe.
I've been so focused on, I...

36:30.188 --> 36:31.624
What about your day?
Take the mic.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.756
-Okay.
-[laughs]

36:33.800 --> 36:35.758
-[clicking] Is it on? Okay.
-[laughs] You...

36:35.802 --> 36:37.456
Um, so, yeah, we had this,
the surprise visit

36:37.499 --> 36:39.849
from a client at work and
everyone was, like, stressed out

36:39.893 --> 36:42.504
and losing their minds, but I
kept my cool and I saved the day

36:42.548 --> 36:44.506
with a stunning pitch
when everyone else had nothing.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.247
-And Pearl even shook my hand.
-That hand?

36:46.291 --> 36:47.248
-Yeah!
-All right! [laughs]

36:47.292 --> 36:48.771
I knew you could do it!

36:48.815 --> 36:50.556
You know, and I-I just applied
the teachings

36:50.599 --> 36:52.166
of Storsh
and it actually worked.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.473
-Oh, my God. I love Storsh.
-Yeah, I know. Me, too.

36:54.516 --> 36:56.779
I'm so jacked up right now,
I can sell anything.

36:56.823 --> 36:59.217
-Well, sell me a birdhouse.
-How about a pun?

36:59.260 --> 37:01.958
Like, uh, Paul's birdhouse,
when nature Pauls.

37:02.002 --> 37:03.308
-That's brilliant!
-[laughs]

37:03.351 --> 37:04.918
Okay, here's another...
Uh, uh...

37:04.961 --> 37:07.703
This birdhouse
will never Paul out of a tree.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.444
You gotta slow down. I gotta
write this down. Seriously. I--

37:09.488 --> 37:11.403
Oh, no, no. Don't even sweat it.
I got a million of 'em.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.492
Okay, how about this one?
Uh, uh, Paul's Boyd...

37:13.535 --> 37:15.581
Paul Boyd's birdie
birdhouse building.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.757
-Ah! You know what your name is?
-What?

37:17.800 --> 37:19.193
-Little Ms. Ideas. Yes.
-No.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.281
-You're amazing.
-No, you're amazing.

37:20.325 --> 37:21.500
-We're amazing.
-Yeah.

37:21.543 --> 37:22.936
You know what this means,
Claire?

37:22.979 --> 37:24.764
We're finally
getting our stuff sorted.

37:24.807 --> 37:25.982
Yeah.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.029
[moaning]

37:37.255 --> 37:38.604
[rattling]

37:42.216 --> 37:44.305
It was the '90s,

37:44.349 --> 37:47.526
a different time,
a simpler time.

37:47.569 --> 37:50.964
When a man committed a crime,
you kicked in the door

37:51.007 --> 37:53.532
and worried about paperwork
later.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.405
But like all good times,

37:57.449 --> 37:59.625
that time was a time

37:59.668 --> 38:02.497
whose time has come to an end.

38:04.847 --> 38:08.068
[Cartwright] Then on April 2nd,
1997,

38:08.111 --> 38:11.767
I came face-to-face
with pure evil.

38:11.811 --> 38:13.378
Reginald Euclid Storsh,

38:13.421 --> 38:15.728
incited over
two dozen innocent victims

38:15.771 --> 38:17.425
to self-murder.

38:17.469 --> 38:20.341
An adversary so brilliant,
so cunning

38:20.385 --> 38:22.038
that to merely be
in his presence

38:22.082 --> 38:23.692
was to risk total mental

38:23.736 --> 38:26.347
and spiritual annihilation.

38:26.391 --> 38:29.263
"Detective Cartwright,
did you have a warrant

38:29.307 --> 38:31.004
for these proceedings?"

38:31.047 --> 38:34.442
"A warrant? Hell, no,
Your Honor, he's guilty."

38:34.486 --> 38:37.402
"Well, I don't care
how ridiculous or stupid

38:37.445 --> 38:40.318
or unfair it is,
I declare a mistrial.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.145
Case dismissed."

38:42.189 --> 38:44.539
"Your Honor, no!"

38:44.583 --> 38:46.889
So I made my life's goal up

38:46.933 --> 38:49.544
to not give him
a moment's rest.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.720
I dogged him like a dog.

38:51.764 --> 38:54.854
But six months into it,
he committed suicide

38:54.897 --> 38:56.508
in a bath tub.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.945
Then his followers started
committing suicide

38:58.988 --> 39:00.076
in the same tub.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.122
Cultist after cultist

39:02.165 --> 39:04.385
dove into a porcelain nightmare

39:04.429 --> 39:06.779
of blood and death.

39:06.822 --> 39:09.347
The chief
still has the case open.

39:09.390 --> 39:11.000
And guess who has to clean up

39:11.044 --> 39:13.133
every time one of these morons

39:13.176 --> 39:15.744
commits a see-pa-coo
in the tub?

39:15.788 --> 39:18.704
That's right. Me. Cartwright.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.749
The last good cop.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.068
[window opens]

39:36.461 --> 39:38.854
Go, go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go.

39:38.898 --> 39:41.770
[instrumental music]

39:47.472 --> 39:48.603
[sighs]

39:57.612 --> 39:59.832
-Hey.
-Mm!

39:59.875 --> 40:02.835
Oh... Oh, come on, man!

40:02.878 --> 40:05.315
-What?
-I booked the tub!

40:05.359 --> 40:07.579
It's been on the schedule
for months.

40:07.622 --> 40:10.277
Okay. Just do it.

40:10.320 --> 40:13.672
Three-way challenge.
Do you yield?

40:13.715 --> 40:15.674
I-I, I don't, I don't know.
Do we?

40:19.329 --> 40:20.635
The invocation.

40:20.679 --> 40:22.463
"In order to get
to instantaneous eternity,

40:22.507 --> 40:23.899
you must pass through
the gateway

40:23.943 --> 40:25.771
chosen by the Holy Storsh."

40:29.949 --> 40:34.040
What? Oh, my God!
You're initiates, aren't you?

40:34.083 --> 40:35.955
Uh, initiates. Yeah.

40:35.998 --> 40:38.392
Actually, do you, do you
think you could teach us

40:38.436 --> 40:40.612
some initiate stuff?

40:43.832 --> 40:47.009
Well, maybe I'll break the rules
this one time.

40:47.053 --> 40:48.663
[laughing]

40:48.707 --> 40:50.404
-[Claire] Awesome.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:50.448 --> 40:54.321
All right, um, you know,
you two guys really lucked out.

40:54.364 --> 40:57.672
It's not every day
that two initiates

40:57.716 --> 41:00.240
get taught their invocation

41:00.283 --> 41:02.416
by a level-six instructor.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.678
-Level six?
-Yeah.

41:03.722 --> 41:05.071
Is that, uh,
is that a good level?

41:05.114 --> 41:06.812
Uh, there's only 11 levels

41:06.855 --> 41:09.858
and I'm level six,
which is basically level seven,

41:09.902 --> 41:11.425
so really I'm an eight.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.559
So, yeah,
I'd say it's pretty damn good.

41:14.602 --> 41:17.605
And I specialize
in invocation training.

41:17.649 --> 41:20.086
You could say
I'm kind of a big deal

41:20.129 --> 41:21.827
down at East Side Bethel,
you know?

41:21.870 --> 41:23.306
-Huh. Mm!
-[Cultist] Okay.

41:23.350 --> 41:25.265
-Uh, so lie down.
-All right.

41:25.308 --> 41:26.919
Here.

41:26.962 --> 41:29.704
Okay. Like the...

41:29.748 --> 41:34.448
Uh, okay, um, scooch down
towards me a little.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.755
Okay, now go left, uh,
just a little bit.

41:36.798 --> 41:38.757
Okay. Actually, scooch back up
just a couple of...

41:38.800 --> 41:41.020
Yeah, okay, that's good.
And come over to your right.

41:41.063 --> 41:42.412
Okay, you're moving faster,
so, so just...

41:42.456 --> 41:43.413
-Yeah. And then...
-Me? Oh. Okay.

41:43.457 --> 41:45.111
You come down just a touch.

41:45.154 --> 41:46.155
Perfect.

41:47.809 --> 41:51.073
Actually, you know what?
Go, go back a little bit.

41:51.117 --> 41:55.208
That's it. That's it! Nice.

41:55.251 --> 41:57.471
This guy is awesome. I mean,
he's basically a level eight.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.473
-[Claire] I know.
-[Paul chuckles]

42:02.911 --> 42:04.783
Okay.

42:04.826 --> 42:08.003
Now look up to the light.

42:10.310 --> 42:12.181
That's life.

42:12.225 --> 42:15.881
It's bright, it's inviting,
it's warm.

42:15.924 --> 42:18.361
That's light. That's life.

42:18.405 --> 42:21.103
And this is death.

42:24.890 --> 42:26.587
What do you see?

42:28.067 --> 42:31.070
[Paul] I-I can still see
an outline.

42:31.113 --> 42:32.854
[Claire] But it's fading.

42:32.898 --> 42:34.247
[Cultist] Exactly.

42:34.290 --> 42:37.380
See, normally when someone dies,

42:37.424 --> 42:40.775
there's a little bit
of afterglow that lingers.

42:40.819 --> 42:43.430
But then unfortunately,
it just disperses

42:43.473 --> 42:45.171
into the ether.

42:45.214 --> 42:49.088
But thanks to the great Storsh,

42:49.131 --> 42:52.787
his chosen will bask
in the light of eternity.

42:52.831 --> 42:55.573
Just because the magical Storsh

42:55.616 --> 42:58.750
spilled his magical blood
in that bath tub,

42:58.793 --> 43:00.708
the bath tub is magical

43:00.752 --> 43:03.624
and will magically hold on
to the afterglow

43:03.668 --> 43:06.279
for all eternity.

43:06.322 --> 43:08.542
All of that in a bath tub?

43:12.677 --> 43:14.635
[grunts]

43:14.679 --> 43:16.681
[sighs]

43:19.988 --> 43:22.556
Would you like to bear witness
to my exodus?

43:31.739 --> 43:35.090
Cyanide. It's quick. Painless.

43:50.715 --> 43:52.717
Well... [gulps]

43:52.760 --> 43:55.154
I'm sorry, I didn't think
I would get emotional.

43:56.808 --> 44:00.289
You know, you two
are gonna be great followers.

44:00.333 --> 44:02.030
[Claire] Hm.

44:02.074 --> 44:03.641
I'm gonna tell Storsh about you

44:03.684 --> 44:06.121
when I get to the other side.

44:06.165 --> 44:08.080
-That's neat.
-[Claire chuckles]

44:10.648 --> 44:11.997
Yeah.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.302
Bye.

44:21.310 --> 44:23.051
It's just a sec.

44:33.409 --> 44:34.541
Any second.

44:40.765 --> 44:42.549
[coughing]

44:47.032 --> 44:49.077
-Oh! Oh! Ow! Whoa!
-Oh...

44:49.121 --> 44:51.558
Whoa, wait, hey,
this actually hurts quite a bit.

44:51.601 --> 44:53.778
-Oh, Go... Oh, no!
-Ah! Oh, God!

44:53.821 --> 44:55.997
Oh! Oh, actually,
this hurts quite a lot actually!

44:56.041 --> 44:58.696
-Do you want some water?
-Oh, for the love of Christ!

44:58.739 --> 45:01.046
[screaming]
They're inside of my body,

45:01.089 --> 45:02.656
burning like a thousand suns!

45:02.700 --> 45:04.702
-No! Oh, no!
-I'll go get a first-aid kit!

45:04.745 --> 45:06.747
-No! You idiot!
-[screaming]

45:06.791 --> 45:09.663
I wanna die! Kill me!

45:09.707 --> 45:10.838
-Kill me!
-Just go!

45:10.882 --> 45:11.926
Oh, my God!

45:11.970 --> 45:13.711
[screaming]

45:17.105 --> 45:18.759
Use this! Use this!

45:18.803 --> 45:20.239
-Me?
-Yes!

45:20.282 --> 45:21.849
Oh! Oh!

45:21.893 --> 45:23.459
[groaning]

45:25.157 --> 45:27.289
-I am sorry!
-[screaming]

45:27.333 --> 45:28.508
[grunting]

45:28.551 --> 45:31.032
What kind of cheap knife
is that?

45:31.076 --> 45:32.773
-We're on a budget, okay?
-No!

45:32.817 --> 45:35.341
-Stab harder! Do it!
-[grunting]

45:35.384 --> 45:37.299
[screaming]

45:41.913 --> 45:44.002
-Come on!
-No!

45:44.045 --> 45:46.047
Oh! Claire, stop it!

45:46.091 --> 45:49.703
-Stop! Claire, no!
-[screaming]

48:07.580 --> 48:09.538
[Claire] You know,
I've been thinking.

48:09.582 --> 48:12.411
When those guys first showed up
and were gonna kill themselves

48:12.454 --> 48:15.240
in our bath tub, I was like,
"Okay, t-this is crazy."

48:15.283 --> 48:17.503
And then when, you know, the
more we learned about Storsh,

48:17.546 --> 48:19.374
I can see
why these people follow him.

48:19.418 --> 48:21.072
You know, I mean, sure,
it's not for everybody,

48:21.115 --> 48:22.943
but think about what good
he's done for us

48:22.987 --> 48:24.423
and we're not even in his cult.

48:24.466 --> 48:26.425
Well, w-we can't be in a cult.
We're from Ohio.

48:26.468 --> 48:27.992
Yeah, but, you know,
when you think about it,

48:28.035 --> 48:29.732
all religions have good and bad.

48:29.776 --> 48:32.387
So, like, maybe we can just
take the good from Storsh

48:32.431 --> 48:34.172
and, like, apply it
to our own lives.

48:34.215 --> 48:36.000
Like, you know, the other day
when you burned your finger

48:36.043 --> 48:37.827
on the glue gun, and you're
like, "Oh, Jesus H. Christ,"

48:37.871 --> 48:39.220
but, like,
you're not even a Christian.

48:39.264 --> 48:41.353
No, you listen,
I'm totally good with having

48:41.396 --> 48:42.920
a little Storsh in our lives,
I mean, it means

48:42.963 --> 48:44.922
a little more blood
and violence, no biggie.

48:44.965 --> 48:46.749
But that's my point,
you know, these poor souls

48:46.793 --> 48:48.795
work so hard to meet Storsh
in the instantaneous eternity,

48:48.838 --> 48:51.015

with the-the, like,

48:51.058 --> 48:52.103
the final commitment, you know?

48:52.146 --> 48:53.147
It's like Cartwright said,

48:53.191 --> 48:54.322
"How many chances do you have

48:54.366 --> 48:55.758
to practice your own suicide?"

-They totally suck at suicide.
-Yeah.

55:41.990 --> 55:44.515
-[coughing]
-Oh, my gosh. Mr. Nordheim!

55:44.558 --> 55:47.300
Did-did you climb up
all of those stairs?

55:47.344 --> 55:48.910
Are you okay? Here.

55:48.954 --> 55:51.565
D-does he need, like,
a defibrillator o-or something?

55:51.609 --> 55:53.088
Uh, should I get him some water?

55:53.132 --> 55:54.438
He's already had his water
today.

55:54.481 --> 55:56.396
Claire, let him go.
Claire, he's fine.

55:56.440 --> 55:57.963
What I am trying to tell you is

55:58.006 --> 56:00.095
that I have come here
to liberate you

56:00.139 --> 56:01.967
from the prison

56:02.010 --> 56:03.490
that you call love.

56:03.534 --> 56:06.058
And, yes,
it will be painful at first,

56:06.101 --> 56:07.842
but eventually
you're gonna thank me.

56:07.886 --> 56:11.542
And I can't say that I'm not
going to enjoy liberating you

56:11.585 --> 56:13.413
by liberating Paul

56:13.457 --> 56:16.155
the way I liberated
that boy in the gym

56:16.198 --> 56:19.463
over and over
and over and over--

56:19.506 --> 56:20.855
Oh, my God!

56:20.899 --> 56:23.249
Oh, oh... Oh, my God! Ho!

56:23.292 --> 56:25.382
I'll go get the first-aid kit.

56:33.477 --> 56:35.392
[chuckling]

56:36.654 --> 56:38.699
Oh, I'm free. I'm free.

56:38.743 --> 56:40.788
I am free. I am finally free!

56:40.832 --> 56:42.442
Oh, my God. I'm finally free.

56:42.486 --> 56:44.488
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, God, thank you.

56:44.531 --> 56:46.925
I so deserved this. Thank you!

56:46.968 --> 56:49.014
Thank you, thank you,
thank you...

56:49.057 --> 56:50.885
-Paul.
-Oh, my gosh!

56:50.929 --> 56:52.409
You're Meegan Nordheim.

56:52.452 --> 56:55.499
Paul, I want you to liberate me.

56:55.542 --> 56:57.152
Liberate me now.

56:57.196 --> 56:59.241
-Uh, is Claire home?
-Forget Claire!

56:59.285 --> 57:01.722
There is no Claire. There is
only you and there is me.

57:01.766 --> 57:03.681
-Okay. I'll get the juice.
-No, no, no...

57:03.724 --> 57:05.509
Paul, come to me.
Paul, I want my bliss now.

57:05.552 --> 57:07.380
Please don't make me wait for
it. Don't make me wait, Paul.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.208
Please, please, please, I want
my bliss. Please, Paul, Paul...

57:09.251 --> 57:10.470
Paul, please, now.

57:10.514 --> 57:13.168
-Oh... Okay, o-okay, okay.
-Okay.

57:13.212 --> 57:15.127
[groaning]

57:23.962 --> 57:26.965
Oh, no. Paul, what did you do?

57:27.008 --> 57:29.620
-I saved her.
-What? Why?

57:29.663 --> 57:31.796
She was a visitor. You said
that we had to help them.

57:31.839 --> 57:33.624
[Claire] No...
Children of Storsh.

57:33.667 --> 57:35.016
Well, how was I supposed
to know that?

57:35.060 --> 57:37.541
It's called logic, Paul!

57:37.584 --> 57:39.456
-Oh, shoot!
-My God!

57:39.499 --> 57:42.154
Oh, no, no, no, no.

57:42.197 --> 57:44.199
You let her paint
the country house?

57:44.243 --> 57:46.680
I'd hardly call that
a country house.

57:46.724 --> 57:48.290
[scoffs] No, no, no, no, no.

57:48.334 --> 57:49.683
Country house, Boyd house,

57:49.727 --> 57:51.250
complete with a little
front-porch swing

57:51.293 --> 57:53.382
and a bird-watching tower
for watching birds.

57:53.426 --> 57:55.733
Looks more like a fire station.

57:55.776 --> 57:57.952
What kind of fire station
has a porch swing?

57:57.996 --> 57:59.867
Forget about the birdhouse,
Paul.

57:59.911 --> 58:01.913
We gotta deal with this now,
okay?

58:01.956 --> 58:03.871
No, no, no. She's-she's...
It's gonna be fine.

58:03.915 --> 58:06.265
I mean, she's still alive.
Everything's, everything's okay.

58:06.308 --> 58:07.875
She's gonna tell everyone
what you did

58:07.919 --> 58:09.007
and you're gonna go to jail!

58:09.050 --> 58:10.965
How can you be so stupid?

58:14.621 --> 58:15.579
Paul!

58:21.585 --> 58:23.500
I'm sorry, Ms. Nordheim.

58:23.543 --> 58:25.806
Not the fire station.

58:25.850 --> 58:27.982
It's a country house.

58:44.390 --> 58:46.305
Cartwright's on his way.

58:48.089 --> 58:50.570
What are you gonna tell him?

58:50.614 --> 58:51.963
A story.

58:54.008 --> 58:55.662
A love story

58:55.706 --> 58:57.969
about a woman who married a man

58:58.012 --> 58:59.927
for all of the right reasons,

58:59.971 --> 59:02.321
and not for his money
and-and not for his power,

59:02.364 --> 59:05.759
but because she saw
who he really was.

59:05.803 --> 59:07.761
A man who needed her

59:07.805 --> 59:10.634
more than she needed him.

59:10.677 --> 59:12.810
It started out
as a pure kind of love,

59:12.853 --> 59:16.683
but it quickly became
something else.

59:16.727 --> 59:20.644
An obligation,
not for her, but for him.

59:22.341 --> 59:25.736
For her it was never
a romantic kind of love.

59:25.779 --> 59:28.565
It was a friend kind of love.

59:28.608 --> 59:31.219
She knew that if she left him,

59:31.263 --> 59:33.613
it would destroy him.

59:33.657 --> 59:37.617
So she stayed by his side
and hoped that he would realize

59:37.661 --> 59:40.228
that he bet on the wrong horse.

59:41.621 --> 59:43.362
But he never did.

59:44.711 --> 59:47.845
So she was trapped...

59:49.586 --> 59:51.500
until she found Storsh.

59:53.328 --> 59:55.417
What she never found
in her marriage,

59:55.461 --> 59:58.899
she found in the open arms
of Storsh and his followers,

59:58.943 --> 01:00:01.162
seekers
of the instantaneous eternity,

01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:03.208
that one brief moment of bliss

01:00:03.251 --> 01:00:05.906
that can go on for forever.

01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:08.692
Armund was so distraught,
so devastated

01:00:08.735 --> 01:00:11.085
by the loss of his one true love

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:13.392
that he sought to follow her.

01:00:13.435 --> 01:00:14.872
He'd rather die in her arms

01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:17.265
than live without her
for one more day.

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:21.574
Wow.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.358
Gosh, darn it, Claire.

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:27.449
I have to say something to you
right now.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:32.585
You-you know what?
We had a problem, right?

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.021
And what do we do?

01:00:34.065 --> 01:00:35.762
-We sorted it.
-Uh-huh.

01:00:35.806 --> 01:00:38.765
This problem is sorted.
It's sorted.

01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:40.680
And it's not just this problem,
it's everything, our...

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:42.464
The-the apartment,
your job, my job.

01:00:42.508 --> 01:00:46.251
We... we are, are sorted.

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.824
What are you doing?

01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:54.999
[Paul] Listen...

01:00:56.870 --> 01:01:01.396
Claire Annabelle McKenty,
will you, will you marry me?

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.225
[stammers] Y-you're doing this
right now?

01:01:04.269 --> 01:01:06.706
No, I know, I know I said
I wouldn't ask again

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.229
until we got our-our stuff
figured out.

01:01:08.273 --> 01:01:11.015
But guess what? We did! We did!

01:01:11.058 --> 01:01:12.277
I wanna be with you forever,
Claire.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.410
I want...
I need you to marry me.

01:01:15.454 --> 01:01:17.978
-Oh, well, okay...
-Okay.

01:01:19.501 --> 01:01:22.809

heard from Snipes

[Cartwright] Claire,
this is huge.

01:04:22.902 --> 01:04:25.078
I should, I gotta put in notice
with my captain, right?

01:04:25.122 --> 01:04:27.037
Because I can't work active
cases if I'm gonna be on set.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.169
Is he gonna want
a producer credit? 'Cause I...

01:04:29.213 --> 01:04:31.084
Between you and me,
he doesn't deserve anything

01:04:31.128 --> 01:04:33.913
more than
associate executive producer.

01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:35.436
Hey, uh, question for you.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.221
[Cartwright]
Anything, Claire, shoot.

01:04:37.264 --> 01:04:39.136
We haven't had a cult member
in a while

01:04:39.179 --> 01:04:41.747
and I just wondered, like,
is there some sort of, like,

01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:43.488
Storsh holiday
that we're not aware of?

01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:46.360
Like a,
like a suicide Yom Kippur?

01:04:46.404 --> 01:04:49.929
Oh, well, it hasn't been
that long, it's three days ago.

01:04:49.973 --> 01:04:51.975
Oh, yeah, okay, cool,
no, it just seems like

01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:53.672
there should've been one by now.

01:04:53.715 --> 01:04:55.935
Actually, uh, a few years ago,
there was a dry spell

01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:57.676
that lasted six months.

01:04:57.719 --> 01:05:00.897
I mean, I thought it was over,

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:03.203
but then
it all started up again.

01:05:03.247 --> 01:05:07.164
Uh, eventually, Claire,
they always come back.

01:05:07.207 --> 01:05:09.296
That's what you gotta understand
about these people.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:12.430
If it helps, think of yourself
as switching places

01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:14.823
with me narratively.
[clears throat]

01:05:14.867 --> 01:05:16.913
You know, you're becoming
kind of the lonely beat cop

01:05:16.956 --> 01:05:19.176
in the wasteland of death,

01:05:19.219 --> 01:05:21.656
I'm becoming
the Hollywood screenwriter.

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:24.790
Hey, Claire, do you think

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.966
that a guy like me

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:30.404
would be able to pen a romcom,

01:05:30.448 --> 01:05:31.971
a romantic comedy?

01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:34.234
I had this story,
you know what they say,

01:05:34.278 --> 01:05:35.453
"Write what you know."

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:38.325
My ex-wife, she went to Ireland

01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:40.980
o-once and she just never
came back,

01:05:41.024 --> 01:05:43.591
and e-eventually we divorced
through the mail

01:05:43.635 --> 01:05:45.637
and it was, it was kinda
like a Lake House

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.900
meets, um, Lady And The Tramp.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:51.164
Because we were really
better friends

01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:54.689
through letters that when
w-when we were sharing a bed.

01:05:54.733 --> 01:05:57.257
And then I eventually,
you know, started talking

01:05:57.301 --> 01:05:59.477
to her new husband.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.044
Um, he's a firefighter.

01:06:01.087 --> 01:06:03.655
Uh, I mean, and Irish
firefighter, you gotta...

01:06:03.698 --> 01:06:05.178
It's pretty cool. Like, like...

01:06:05.222 --> 01:06:07.050
As-as much as I don't wanna
admit it, like,

01:06:07.093 --> 01:06:09.182
that's pretty much
a manlier occupation.

01:06:09.226 --> 01:06:12.272
I mean, an the Irish already
fight everything.

01:06:12.316 --> 01:06:14.100
This guy fights fire.

01:06:14.144 --> 01:06:16.624
Uh, [chuckles], I-I-I just
thought, like,

01:06:16.668 --> 01:06:18.670
kind of a,
like a triangle thing

01:06:18.713 --> 01:06:21.673
with like
Matthew McConaughey, uh,

01:06:21.716 --> 01:06:24.067
Kate Hudson and maybe
like Wesley Snipes.

01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:27.026
If he gets one on this one...

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:29.028
[water gurgling]

01:06:29.072 --> 01:06:30.987
[dramatic music]

01:06:38.777 --> 01:06:41.171
Okay, so listen,
Nordheim wasn't in the cult.

01:06:41.214 --> 01:06:42.868
-But we saved her anyway.
-Well, she needed to be saved.

01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:44.783
-She wanted to kill puppies.
-Exactly.

01:06:44.826 --> 01:06:46.393
So before we were saving people

01:06:46.437 --> 01:06:48.308
into the instantaneous eternity
who wanted to be saved,

01:06:48.352 --> 01:06:50.136
but maybe we save people
who need to be saved

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.485
that don't even know
they need to be saved.

01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:52.530
That's great, like murderers

01:06:52.573 --> 01:06:54.227
and rapists or celebrity chefs.

01:06:54.271 --> 01:06:57.013
Exactly. Okay. Let's do this.

01:06:58.623 --> 01:07:00.538
[instrumental music]

01:07:04.672 --> 01:07:05.630
[grunts]

01:07:28.653 --> 01:07:30.568
[music continues]

01:07:40.534 --> 01:07:44.060
It's a, um, new anti-depressant.

01:07:44.103 --> 01:07:46.105
We have to sell people
on getting happy

01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:48.673
because apparantly
hopelessness and despair

01:07:48.716 --> 01:07:50.979
are currently trending.

01:07:51.023 --> 01:07:53.678
Mr. Carl, I've got this.

01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:01.816
The only way to achieve
complete happiness is...

01:08:03.601 --> 01:08:07.126
by inviting the father and
savior Storsh in to your heart.

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:09.172
Now, I-I know, I know you're all
looking at me

01:08:09.215 --> 01:08:11.609
like you're a little skeptical,
but believe me, I was too,

01:08:11.652 --> 01:08:13.480
but, you know, you just,
you just gotta go for it.

01:08:13.524 --> 01:08:15.613
So, I-I'd love
for you guys to join.

01:08:15.656 --> 01:08:17.615
You know, just a bunch
of like-minded people

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:20.008
who wanna be as happy
as they can be. [laughs]

01:08:21.706 --> 01:08:23.925
That's all very interesting.

01:08:23.969 --> 01:08:26.406
And you've given us a lot
to think about.

01:08:28.408 --> 01:08:30.627
[dramatic music]

01:08:30.671 --> 01:08:33.152
Stupid legs, stupid legs.

01:08:33.196 --> 01:08:34.849
Stupid rigor-mortis legs!

01:08:34.893 --> 01:08:37.156
Oh! Fuck!

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:40.246
Claire! Claire!
Thanks God you're home.

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:43.206
Something terrible has happened.
They shut down my website.

01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:44.555
And my credit card was declined.

01:08:44.598 --> 01:08:47.078
I was just so busy
making birdhouses

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.908
that I forgot to pay
and then the bank was so far

01:08:49.951 --> 01:08:52.171
that I didn't wanna walk
and I spent all my money

01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:53.999
on skittles and wood
and thanks God...

01:08:54.042 --> 01:08:56.741
Thanks God for you, Claire,
thanks God for you.

01:08:56.783 --> 01:08:58.524
Can you swap me 200 bucks?

01:08:58.569 --> 01:09:01.528
They fired me, Paul!
They fired me!

01:09:01.572 --> 01:09:03.182
-We don't have jobs.
-[groaning]

01:09:03.225 --> 01:09:06.316
We are unsorted, Paul!
We're unsorted!

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:09.319
[Paul groaning]

01:09:09.362 --> 01:09:12.322
What are we gonna do, Claire?
What are we gonna do?

01:09:12.365 --> 01:09:14.715
I love you. I love you. Uh...

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.716
Yeah?

01:09:19.416 --> 01:09:21.331
[instrumental music]

01:09:30.904 --> 01:09:32.819
[Claire screaming]

01:09:41.002 --> 01:09:42.917
[Claire grunting]

01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:50.490
[birds chirping]

01:10:03.111 --> 01:10:05.026
[eerie music]

01:10:27.788 --> 01:10:29.703
[bells chiming]

01:10:55.816 --> 01:11:00.343
[Paul] Claire Annabelle McKenty,
you, will you marry me?

01:11:12.398 --> 01:11:15.009
[sobbing] No.

01:11:15.053 --> 01:11:16.968
I can't marry you.

01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:37.554
[operatic singing]

01:11:53.439 --> 01:11:55.572
Hello, Claire, my child.

01:11:57.878 --> 01:12:01.360
-It's you.
-It's me.

01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:03.014
I-I can't believe it.
You-you came.

01:12:03.057 --> 01:12:04.276
They doubted you, but you came.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.540
Shh, quiet now.
Let's not spoil it.

01:12:07.584 --> 01:12:09.194
I just can't believe it.

01:12:09.237 --> 01:12:11.109
You're actually,
you're here i-in my tub.

01:12:11.152 --> 01:12:12.545
[Storsh] Remember the thing
about not spoiling it

01:12:12.589 --> 01:12:14.155
that I just said
six seconds ago?

01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:16.941
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sorry.
I just...

01:12:16.984 --> 01:12:19.509
Well, y-your teachings
have changed my life.

01:12:19.552 --> 01:12:21.511
-Mm-hmm.
-It's just...

01:12:21.554 --> 01:12:23.295
Things aren't working now
and I don't know,

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.341
I don't know
where I've gone wrong.

01:12:25.384 --> 01:12:27.386
Mm, tell you,
when this whole thing started,

01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:30.389
I never thought it would spread
further than my backyard.

01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:32.304
Just a bunch of crazy loons
dancing in the light

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:36.003
of the instantaneous eternity
over nachos and Fanta.

01:12:36.047 --> 01:12:39.355
But soon the whole city
became my backyard.

01:12:39.398 --> 01:12:42.619
The beacon of Storsh was lit
and the people came.

01:12:44.055 --> 01:12:45.491
I know I did.

01:12:45.535 --> 01:12:47.101
I know you know you did.

01:12:47.145 --> 01:12:49.539
I was watching you
from the afterlife.

01:12:49.582 --> 01:12:53.107
You know, the spiritual reward
for saving souls was incredible.

01:12:53.151 --> 01:12:54.979
What a buzz!
It's just like a tingle.

01:12:55.022 --> 01:12:56.981
But soon that wasn't enough.

01:12:57.024 --> 01:12:58.722
I needed to reach
more of my children,

01:12:58.765 --> 01:13:00.506
I needed the message
to find the masses

01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:02.769
and save the souls
of the entire world

01:13:02.813 --> 01:13:05.119
like, on a God level.

01:13:05.163 --> 01:13:09.472
You know, I, I made a plan
and that plan was I'd get caught

01:13:09.515 --> 01:13:11.648
and I'd become
a media sensation.

01:13:11.691 --> 01:13:14.128
Live out my days in some
cushy, white-collared prison

01:13:14.172 --> 01:13:15.739
like Bundy Romanson.

01:13:15.782 --> 01:13:19.133
TV specials, conjugal visits.

01:13:19.177 --> 01:13:21.440
So I let that cop catch me.

01:13:21.484 --> 01:13:24.269
You know this guy,
you know who I'm talking about?

01:13:24.312 --> 01:13:25.923
-Cartwright?
-Yeah.

01:13:25.966 --> 01:13:28.055
Naturally, he screwed it all up
and I got off.

01:13:28.099 --> 01:13:29.753
But it turns out,
getting away with it

01:13:29.796 --> 01:13:32.190
was like some major power move.

01:13:32.233 --> 01:13:33.670
Next thing,
I'm this huge celebrity,

01:13:33.713 --> 01:13:34.932
people following me around,

01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:36.324
"Oh, Storsh, have my baby.

01:13:36.368 --> 01:13:37.891
Storsh, can I get a photo?

01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:40.067
Storsh, can I get a photo
of you and me

01:13:40.111 --> 01:13:41.373
trying to make babies?"

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.027
People offering me book deals,

01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:45.421
multiple book deals,
like a three-book deal.

01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:49.120
In the grocery store,
people offering me cupcakes,

01:13:49.163 --> 01:13:50.861
people... I mean, you name it.

01:13:50.904 --> 01:13:53.298
I had an assistant...

01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:55.431
for a little while.

01:13:55.474 --> 01:13:57.433
But then I realized,
"Oh, my God.

01:13:57.476 --> 01:13:59.391
I could immortalize myself

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:01.045
and forever spread
the word of Storsh

01:14:01.088 --> 01:14:04.483
with the ultimate saving.
Who? Me, myself."

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:06.964
So I climbed in this bathtub
here and I did my thing

01:14:07.007 --> 01:14:10.663
and in one fell swoop, I became
the god I was destined to be.

01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:15.494
Oh, that is so beautiful.

01:14:15.538 --> 01:14:18.323
Yeah, I guess it is.

01:14:18.366 --> 01:14:21.282
But, you, Claire, you, my love.

01:14:21.326 --> 01:14:23.154
None of my followers
have served me

01:14:23.197 --> 01:14:25.417
as greatly or lovingly as you.

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:28.420
And yet, there is still one
final lesson for you to learn.

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:30.988
Oh, teach me. I-I want to learn.

01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:35.514
You've been so focused
on saving everyone else,

01:14:35.558 --> 01:14:39.387
[mumbles] you've forgotten the
most important person of all.

01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:42.086
I-I'm sorry, what?

01:14:42.129 --> 01:14:44.915
You've been so focused
on saving everyone else,

01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:48.527
[mumbles] you've forgotten the
most important person of all.

01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:49.746
I-I don't--

01:14:49.789 --> 01:14:50.790
You've forgotten
the most important

01:14:50.834 --> 01:14:52.183
person of all.

01:14:53.576 --> 01:14:56.927
Oh... Oh.

01:14:56.970 --> 01:15:01.235
Yeah. I understand.

01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:03.934
I understand.

01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:09.287
The door to my bus
is always open, Claire.

01:15:10.593 --> 01:15:11.942
Always open.

01:15:14.553 --> 01:15:16.468
[dramatic music]

01:15:25.172 --> 01:15:27.087
[music intensifies]

01:15:43.016 --> 01:15:44.931
[humming]

01:15:50.328 --> 01:15:51.982
Hey, Cartwright.

01:15:52.025 --> 01:15:56.116
I heard you're, uh, going off
to make your movie.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.902
Yeah.
Finally pulling it together.

01:15:58.945 --> 01:16:00.599
-Oh.
-[Cartwright chuckling]

01:16:00.643 --> 01:16:02.035
I'll see you at the premiere.

01:16:02.079 --> 01:16:03.994
[laughing]

01:16:07.737 --> 01:16:09.042
Oh-ho...

01:16:11.654 --> 01:16:14.047
Ah, man, you're such a wiener.

01:16:14.091 --> 01:16:15.832
[laughing]

01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:19.618
Oh, man. [laughing]

01:16:31.761 --> 01:16:33.110
Hey.

01:16:33.153 --> 01:16:34.111
Hey.

01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:39.116
Still wanna go to Winnipeg?

01:16:39.159 --> 01:16:41.727
[chuckles] Not really.

01:16:41.771 --> 01:16:43.337
Yeah, me neither.

01:16:46.993 --> 01:16:48.691
And while you were in there
talking to the bathtub,

01:16:48.734 --> 01:16:51.476
I did some thinking.

01:16:51.519 --> 01:16:53.696
Yeah?

01:16:53.739 --> 01:16:57.656
The reason
you never really married me.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.005
I get it.

01:17:00.703 --> 01:17:01.965
You do?

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.274
You love me.

01:17:07.318 --> 01:17:11.148
It's just not
a romantic kind of love.

01:17:11.191 --> 01:17:13.106
It's a friend kind of love.

01:17:14.107 --> 01:17:15.848
Oh, Paul...

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:20.766
I'm sorry.

01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:23.508
For what?

01:17:25.118 --> 01:17:27.338
That I'm not smart.

01:17:27.381 --> 01:17:30.297
What? No. No.

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:33.605
You're the smartest guy I know.

01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:47.619
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:53.712
[dramatic music]

01:18:11.861 --> 01:18:14.428
This is the sloppiest tub death
I've ever seen.

01:18:18.563 --> 01:18:21.348
It's weird how they all have
some kind of red dye

01:18:21.392 --> 01:18:22.959
on their lips now.

01:18:23.002 --> 01:18:24.917
Yeah, it's totally weird, right?

01:18:30.793 --> 01:18:33.230
Her elderly,
physically-decrypted husband

01:18:33.273 --> 01:18:35.275
from whom she stands
to inherit millions

01:18:35.319 --> 01:18:37.582
somehow gets his walker up
the flight of stairs.

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:39.366
That part's actually true.

01:18:51.117 --> 01:18:53.032
[instrumental music]

01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:05.088
What is that? This one.

01:19:05.131 --> 01:19:08.961
That, that's the coffee shop
where we had our first kiss.

01:19:10.833 --> 01:19:13.096
What's this?

01:19:13.139 --> 01:19:17.927
Uh, it's the pizza shop where
I thought we had our first kiss.

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:19.232
Oh. [chuckles]
