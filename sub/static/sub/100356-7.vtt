- That's your wedding song?

33:15.661 --> 33:17.094
- She loves shania twain.
- Yeah, it's cute.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.328
- Oh, sorry,
I thought it was a joke.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.663
But I was like, no.
- Why? Why?

33:19.698 --> 33:21.498
Because we went through hell
and back.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.033
- No, I know, but it's...
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

33:23.068 --> 33:24.534
No, it's good for them.
- It's great.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.269
Because it's a song about
proving everybody wrong

33:26.305 --> 33:27.738
and making it, like,
after everyone saying,

33:27.773 --> 33:29.439
"oh, it's not gonna work."
- oh, no, I get it.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.174
Now I get it. I just--
- and you knocked it.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.776
- I thought you were kidding.
Is that really the song?

33:32.811 --> 33:34.211
- Yes, it's the song.
- Is that really the song?

33:34.246 --> 33:35.345
- Yes, dude!
- It's not ironic.

33:35.381 --> 33:36.646
No, you made it so much worse.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.682
- Now I'm insecure
about my song.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.150
- It's okay, it's okay.
No, no, it's a great song.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.019
- No, it's a great song.
I love shania.

33:42.054 --> 33:44.021
For jax and brittany to dance
to "you're still the one"

33:44.056 --> 33:49.359
by shania twain at their wedding
is just...Perfect.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.161
I love shania.
- Because it's like,

33:51.196 --> 33:53.663
"oh, my god. You<i> weren't</i>
gonna make it," but then we

33:53.699 --> 33:55.532
proved everybody wrong.
- Right.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.402
The very thing that jax and brit
have forbidden people

33:58.437 --> 34:00.370
to talk about
is literally written

34:00.406 --> 34:02.072
in the lyrics of the song.

34:02.107 --> 34:03.507
Right, right, right, no.
I just--I thought it was--

34:03.542 --> 34:06.543
- so we made it.
- Oh! I get it now.

34:06.578 --> 34:09.012
- I've never hit
a ----ing baseball in my life.

34:09.048 --> 34:10.580
Is it gonna tell me
when it's gonna go?

34:10.616 --> 34:14.184
- Come on!
- Goddammit!

34:14.219 --> 34:16.219
- Got it, got it.
Throw it hard.

34:16.255 --> 34:17.821
- Oh! She got it.
- I got it in that one.

34:17.856 --> 34:21.391
- This is called snake cock.
- Snake...

34:21.427 --> 34:23.060
- Snake cock?
[ laughter ]

34:23.095 --> 34:24.194
it should be called, like,
"nice to meet ya."

34:24.229 --> 34:26.229
- nice to meet ya.

34:26.265 --> 34:29.166
- I feel like working at sur's
where you really have to, like,

34:29.201 --> 34:32.069
hone in
on your sh-- talking skills.

34:32.104 --> 34:33.670
- Agreed.
- 'cause if you're not

34:33.705 --> 34:35.572
a part of it,
you're the subject of it.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.107
- Well, I'm currently
the subject of it.

34:37.142 --> 34:39.076
- We definitely heard
a little bit.

34:39.111 --> 34:40.577
- Wear a bra. Like,
we're literally talking outside,

34:40.612 --> 34:42.412
and her nipples are hard.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.214
- She was talking about how,
like, you don't wear a bra.

34:44.249 --> 34:45.615
Oh...My ----ing god.
- But then she's talking about

34:45.651 --> 34:47.417
how she's really clicking--
- none of us--

34:47.453 --> 34:48.785
none of us wear bras.
- I know, 'cause it's petty.

34:48.821 --> 34:52.355
- It's literally about max.
- Totally.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.724
Okay, so then, last night,

34:54.760 --> 34:57.461
max and I basically
had a talk about where we're at,

34:57.496 --> 34:59.796
and basically,
we decided to be exclusive.

34:59.832 --> 35:01.131
- So, like,
boyfriend-girlfriend?

35:01.166 --> 35:03.266
- Yeah.
- Ooh. [ laughs ]

35:03.302 --> 35:05.469
- and I seriously am not trying
to make waves with that.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.105
Scheana and I just made up
five minutes ago at pride.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.573
So I'm not gonna run to her
and be like,

35:09.608 --> 35:12.375
"oh, my god.
Max finally gave me the thing

35:12.411 --> 35:13.877
that you always wanted."

35:13.912 --> 35:15.779
- what happens--when scheana--
there's a guy

35:15.814 --> 35:17.447
that she, like, likes...
- Yeah.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.915
- ...Or has liked,
she kind of pisses on them,

35:18.951 --> 35:20.550
but they become like
property to her,

35:20.586 --> 35:22.052
like that's her territory.
- Yeah.

35:22.087 --> 35:24.321
- And you are now
on her territory with max.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.456
- I was like,
"bitch, what did I do to you?"

35:26.492 --> 35:27.891
[ laughter ]

35:27.926 --> 35:31.294
- I wasn't sure about
this new dayna girl.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.596
- It's insecurity.
- Yeah.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.565
But there's nothing like

35:35.601 --> 35:37.934
a good sh-- talking
scheana fest

35:37.970 --> 35:40.470
to just bring
two random bitches together.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.439
- Now that you and max are,
like, exclusive,

35:42.474 --> 35:44.908
do you think she might
pop off again?

35:44.943 --> 35:46.309
- I mean, I never know
what to expect with her.

♪♪♪

35:47.813 --> 35:49.679

Lance is gonna marry us.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.683
I'm literally gonna have him
fly in on a speedo

35:53.719 --> 35:55.452

35:59.858 --> 36:01.458
- Oh!
- Sorry, sorry.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.592

at the bar.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.260
- All right.
- All right.

36:04.997 --> 36:07.297
- Oh, no, don't.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.334
- I love the bridal shower,

36:11.370 --> 36:12.869
and then I post the photo.

36:12.905 --> 36:15.639
And people on social media
were just being very mean

36:15.674 --> 36:18.675
and, like, making fun of us
for having a princess party.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.710
I'm just being attacked,
attacked, attacked.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.280
It just really sucks.
You can only take so much.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.548
[ voice breaking ]
I was so happy today

36:24.583 --> 36:26.349

- You should be.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.684
- What's wrong?

36:27.719 --> 36:29.619
- Just people just being mean
to me.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.788
And, like, "this is pathetic,"
literally, every single comment.

36:31.823 --> 36:34.357
- Brittany, who gives
a [ bleep ]?

36:34.393 --> 36:36.326

through sh--

36:36.361 --> 36:38.395
aside from my old pastor stuff.

36:38.430 --> 36:41.831
Now people are, like, commenting
on my bridal shower.

36:41.867 --> 36:42.999
This is supposed to be
the best time,

36:43.035 --> 36:44.734
the happiest time of my life.

36:44.770 --> 36:48.004
Why do people have to, like,
ruin everything? Why?

36:48.040 --> 36:50.974
- I'm just curious.

36:51.009 --> 36:54.544
You know, I've read a lot
about this pastor

36:54.580 --> 36:57.647
that you guys were gonna have,
and I wanna--I wanna--

36:57.683 --> 36:59.883
- no, what happened? I have
lance bass as my pastor.

36:59.918 --> 37:02.485
- No, I know, but I'm saying
the pastor that you had

37:02.521 --> 37:04.487
until, like, three days ago.
- Right.

37:04.523 --> 37:06.656
- I'm wondering, like, why it
took lisa coming to you guys

37:06.692 --> 37:08.358
about this guy.
- No, no, no.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.926
I'm not talking about this.

Done. And it didn't take lisa.

before my wedding.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.771
Why would you do
something like that?

37:21.807 --> 37:23.740
- I wanna ask questions.

37:23.775 --> 37:25.408
- I did nothing wrong!
So [ bleep ] you.

- Why is she crying?

37:36.154 --> 37:37.821
- What?
- Brittany, why are you crying?

37:37.856 --> 37:40.023
- Jealousy is literally
the root of all evil.

- Not only that. There's more
of, like, people are just like--

37:47.799 --> 37:49.599

to say it took lisa vanderpump

about it?

38:01.713 --> 38:03.446
You do not know
what I've been going through.

to hurt somebody like that?

- we all were! So was she!

38:25.904 --> 38:27.837
- Okay, well,
I wanted to find out--

- oh, we're so sorry

38:29.474 --> 38:30.874
- I was upset about what I saw!
- Okay.

- That's why I fired him,

another pastor.

38:34.179 --> 38:36.513
- Okay, okay, well, I wanna--
I wanna ask questions.

38:36.548 --> 38:39.549
All I wanted to do
was talk to jax off on our own,

38:39.584 --> 38:42.152
like, you know, "hey, you need
to be a little bit more aware

38:42.187 --> 38:43.887
about these things."

hit the fan.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.660
- But why is tom having
an opinion about it?

38:50.696 --> 38:52.529
- He's asking the question.

38:52.564 --> 38:53.897
- What does it matter
who we have marry us?

38:53.932 --> 38:55.498
- Come on. Come on.
- You guys have been

38:55.534 --> 38:56.800

It's been talked about.

- But why do we--who we have
marry us--why does it matter?

38:58.837 --> 39:00.136
- What do you mean,
why does it matter?

39:00.172 --> 39:01.805
- It's not anyone's
----ing business.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.073
- This is my marriage.
- We have done everything

39:03.108 --> 39:05.041
that we can do.
I saw one comment.

Whenever I saw it,

39:08.580 --> 39:10.013
I did something about it!

what's going on,

everyone yelling at everyone.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.652
- How dare you?!
- Back in January?

39:15.687 --> 39:17.987
- Back in January,
I saw one comment.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.923
- What about
the transphobic sh--?

39:19.958 --> 39:21.758
- I didn't see any of that!
None of that!

39:21.793 --> 39:23.927
- That was in 2018.
- I chose to believe him, okay?

39:23.962 --> 39:26.730
This is my friend! I'm so sorry
that I didn't go back

39:26.765 --> 39:28.998
and look at comments
from five ----ing years ago.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.834
- I don't know what's going on
right now,

39:30.869 --> 39:32.769
and I feel uncomfortable.
- The fact that you're making

39:32.804 --> 39:34.938
her defend herself right now
is disgusting.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.873
- I asked the question.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.709
I just feel like it's dangerous
to have a group of friends

39:39.745 --> 39:42.045
where people are not allowed
to speak up

39:42.080 --> 39:43.780
when they feel like
something's wrong.

39:43.815 --> 39:46.549
- You said, "it really took
lisa vanderpump?"

39:46.585 --> 39:48.952
you know, why can't--
- that's a question.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.121
- Oh, my god!
- Are you kidding me?

39:51.156 --> 39:53.022
It just pissed me off that
jax wasn't standing up

39:53.058 --> 39:55.792
for his friends--for my friends,

39:55.827 --> 39:57.527
for the community
that we're a part of.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.529
- You're making yourself
look like a martyr.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.131
Like, you're like...
- Martyr?

40:01.166 --> 40:02.966
- ...Jon snow-ing yourself
so hard where I feel like...

40:03.001 --> 40:03.967
- I'm not trying to like--
- ...You think that you're

40:04.002 --> 40:05.869
standing up for things.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.804
- What the [ bleep ]
are you talking about?

40:07.839 --> 40:10.774
- Jon snow always just has
to do what's right,

40:10.809 --> 40:13.910
despite who he hurts
or who he's betraying.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.613
But, sandoval,
we're not in westeros.

40:16.648 --> 40:19.716
We're in koreatown. Just be nice
to your friends, man.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.218
- No one who is a real friend
to me would do this.

40:22.254 --> 40:23.853
- What, ask you a question?

40:23.889 --> 40:26.256
- "how are you?"
is the only question

40:26.291 --> 40:28.158
you should be asking.

40:28.193 --> 40:30.226
- Oh, no, he's, you know, he's
probably looking out for you.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.929
- Me? No, he's questioning
my motives.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.063
- No, he's not.
- Like, I think this is

40:34.099 --> 40:35.598
a topic you don't talk about.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.167
This is a topic
you don't go near.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.302
