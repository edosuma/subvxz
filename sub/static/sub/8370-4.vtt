00:58.191 --> 01:00.292
_

01:00.326 --> 01:01.994
_

01:06.166 --> 01:08.333
- Back off!
- You back off, Kion.

01:08.368 --> 01:10.369
- That's my tree!
- Your tree?

01:10.403 --> 01:13.105
I found it first.
So step aside.

01:13.139 --> 01:16.075
No way!
You can't tell me what to do.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.377
Uh, actually, she can.

01:18.411 --> 01:22.014
For the next few days,
Kiara will be queen.

01:22.048 --> 01:24.249
- Me?
- Her? Queen?

01:24.284 --> 01:26.018
Dad, what's going on?

01:26.052 --> 01:28.053
Kiara will be acting queen

01:28.088 --> 01:30.389
while your Mom and I
are away in Kilio Valley.

01:30.423 --> 01:33.158
Kilio Valley? You're
visiting the elephants?

01:33.193 --> 01:36.195
Yes. We have
a funeral to attend.

01:36.229 --> 01:38.497
My friend Aminifu
passed away.

01:38.531 --> 01:40.299
I remember him.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.201
He was a wise elephant.

01:42.235 --> 01:45.137
Yes. He helped the Pride
Lands return to normal

01:45.171 --> 01:46.405
after Scar was defeated.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.273
Once the elephants returned,

01:48.308 --> 01:50.109
all the other animals followed.

01:50.143 --> 01:52.444
And the Circle of Life
came back into balance.

01:52.479 --> 01:55.080
And now Aminifu
has completed

01:55.115 --> 01:56.448
his part
of the Circle of Life.

01:57.383 --> 01:59.418
I'm so sorry, Dad.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.387
Uh, how long
will you be gone?

02:02.422 --> 02:04.423
Just a few days.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.159
And I'll let you in
on a little secret.

02:07.193 --> 02:10.162
I was nervous about ruling
the Pride Lands at first, too.

02:10.196 --> 02:12.197
I'm not nervous.

02:12.232 --> 02:14.333
Well, maybe a little.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.401
It's okay.
I have faith in you...

02:20.106 --> 02:22.407
and the Lion Guard.

02:22.442 --> 02:25.344
Just keep the peace, and
everything will be fine.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.012
I won't let you down, Dad.

02:27.046 --> 02:28.147
I know, princess.

02:28.181 --> 02:31.049
Or, should I say Queen?

02:41.227 --> 02:43.395
It is a big responsibility.

02:43.429 --> 02:45.330
Worried about Kiara?

02:45.365 --> 02:47.232
Or are you worried
about your tribute?

02:47.267 --> 02:49.501
Why would I be
worried about that?

02:49.536 --> 02:52.371
Maybe because you have to
say it in Elephantese?

02:52.405 --> 02:56.141
Yes. 
Elephants and their traditions.

02:56.176 --> 03:00.279
And they take those traditions
very seriously, sire.

03:00.313 --> 03:03.215
Oh, believe me, I know.
It has to be perfect.

03:03.249 --> 03:06.385
True. But it's
just one phrase.

03:06.419 --> 03:09.321
Eihe kala pano tou.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.156
Hmm. Easy for you to say.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.125
Oh, I suppose it is.

03:13.159 --> 03:16.028
But then, I am
fluent in Elephant.

03:16.062 --> 03:18.163
Not to mention
gorilla, chimpanzee,

03:18.198 --> 03:20.199
and several dialects
of bushbuck.

03:20.233 --> 03:22.167
Yes, Zazu. We know.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.185
<i>Believe me, sire.
By the time we get there,</i>

03:25.220 --> 03:27.306
<i>I'll have you speaking
like a true elephant!</i>

03:30.076 --> 03:34.379
Hmm. Simba and Nala
leaving the Pride Lands.

03:34.414 --> 03:37.015
This will be worth
keeping an eye on.

03:39.118 --> 03:40.419
<i>It's things like this</i>

03:40.453 --> 03:43.222
<i>that almost make me
wish I wasn't king.</i>

03:43.256 --> 03:47.125
Come now, sire.
It's really not as bad as all that.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.428
Having to say goodbye
to an old friend

03:49.462 --> 03:52.064
in a language
that I don't understand?

03:52.098 --> 03:55.133
Yes, this is an unfortunate duty.

03:55.168 --> 03:58.170
But you have so many other
wonderful ones, sire,

03:58.204 --> 04:00.105
if I may say so.

04:00.139 --> 04:01.440
Actually, Zazu, I think Simba

04:01.474 --> 04:05.425
- could use a little reminding.
- Yes, of course.

I do feel better now.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.170
Wonderful, sire.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.107
Now, about your
Elephantese accent.

06:18.311 --> 06:22.314
Hey! Did you hear? Kiara is
queen of the Pride Lands!

06:22.348 --> 06:25.283
Yeah! It's
un-Bunga-lievable!

06:25.318 --> 06:27.352
Hmm, it was going to
happen eventually.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.354
I'm sure she'll be
a nice queen.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.290
Kiara's only queen while
my mom and dad are away.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.093
Anybody see Ono?

06:35.128 --> 06:37.429
It's not like him to be
late for morning patrol.

06:37.463 --> 06:39.131
Here he comes.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.001
And there he goes?

06:43.035 --> 06:45.170
What? Why is he
going to Pride Rock?

06:46.272 --> 06:48.140
<i>Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.</i>

06:48.174 --> 06:50.342
- Got to get clean for the queen.
- Ono.

06:50.376 --> 06:53.078
What are you doing?
We've got a patrol.

06:53.112 --> 06:54.479
Oh. I'm sorry, Kion.

06:54.514 --> 06:57.416
- Uh, Queen Kiara asked me...
- Queen Kiara?

06:57.450 --> 07:00.218
Uh, Kion?

07:00.253 --> 07:05.056
Announcing Her Majesty...
Ruler of the Pride Lands...

07:05.091 --> 07:06.992
<i>Queen Kiara!</i>

07:07.026 --> 07:09.261
Make way!
Make way for the queen!

07:09.295 --> 07:11.029
Your Majesty.

07:12.465 --> 07:15.167
Bunga, that's really
not necessary.

07:15.201 --> 07:18.303
Thank you, Your Majest...
You're queen now, Kiara.

07:18.337 --> 07:19.371
Let him bow.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.339
Yeah. Everyone should bow.

07:23.042 --> 07:25.043
Oh. Well, not us.

07:25.077 --> 07:27.379
<i>It's my pleasure, Your Majesty.</i>

07:27.413 --> 07:29.281
Bunga, stand up.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.283
Your wish is my command!

07:33.286 --> 07:37.289
Kiara, what was so important you
had to take Ono away from our patrol?

07:37.323 --> 07:39.991
Zazu went with
Mom and Dad, remember?

07:40.026 --> 07:42.127
I need someone to give me
the morning report.

07:42.161 --> 07:44.362
And Ono is the
keenest of sight.

07:44.397 --> 07:48.333
Yeah, okay. But he's still
part of the Lion Guard.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.335
You should have
asked me first.

07:50.369 --> 07:52.304
Kion! Kiara's your queen!

07:52.338 --> 07:55.240
She doesn't have to ask
anyone for anything anymore.

07:57.143 --> 08:00.245
Except when I'm asking
for the morning report.

08:00.279 --> 08:02.981
- Ono?
- Your Majesty!

08:03.015 --> 08:06.335
Uh, all appears to be in order from

08:06.336 --> 08:08.253
Mekundu Cliffs to Ukuni Woods.

08:08.287 --> 08:11.122
There's much excitement about
your becoming acting queen.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.291
The oryxes aren't fighting,
for a change.

08:13.326 --> 08:17.262
The eland herd is migrating
east along the river as expected.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.998
Oh, also on the path
along the river,

08:20.032 --> 08:22.133
I spotted a new cluster
of beehives.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.336
Bees make great snacks.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.004
If you say so.

08:26.038 --> 08:28.073
And that's
the morning report.

08:28.107 --> 08:30.108
Interesting.
Thank you, Ono.

08:30.142 --> 08:32.043
Yeah. Great job, Ono.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.145
Thank you for the
opportunity, my queen.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.450
And you, er... my Kion?

08:38.484 --> 08:41.019
Sounds like everything is okay.

08:41.053 --> 08:45.023
So can I have Ono back for the
Guard's morning patrol now?

08:45.057 --> 08:47.125
Hang on, I'm...
I'm thinking.

08:47.159 --> 08:49.327
The bees are building hives
on the path along the river.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.363
The elands use
that same path.

08:51.397 --> 08:54.199
If the elands step on the
beehives, they'll get stung!

08:54.233 --> 08:57.168
The herd would break up
and there could be chaos.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.370
I didn't think of that.

08:58.404 --> 09:01.139
You didn't have to.
You're not the queen.

09:02.975 --> 09:06.077
Okay. Lion Guard,
let's move out.

09:06.112 --> 09:07.946
Kion, wait.

09:07.980 --> 09:11.082
Can you and the Guard divert the
eland away from the bees' nests?

09:11.117 --> 09:14.119
Huh? I guess we could, but...

09:14.153 --> 09:16.955
Ohh! Queen Kiara's
first official decree!

09:16.989 --> 09:18.223
My first decree?

09:18.257 --> 09:20.992
Queen Kiara's first decree!

09:21.027 --> 09:23.228
The Lion Guard will...
What was it?

09:23.262 --> 09:27.198
The Lion Guard will divert the
eland herd away from the beehives.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.167
So says the queen.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.236
Yes. So says me.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.438
Come on, guys.

09:33.472 --> 09:36.274
By your command,
my queen.

09:38.344 --> 09:40.345
Did I just get an order
from my sister?

09:40.379 --> 09:44.015
No. You got
an official decree.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.418
No, no, no, sire.

09:46.452 --> 09:51.323
Like this,
Eihe kala pano tou.

09:51.357 --> 09:55.060
Ehke kana pao tu.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.095
What's does this mean, again?

09:57.129 --> 10:01.433
Literally, it translates to,
"He had good on him."

10:01.467 --> 10:03.468
It means he was
a good elephant.

10:03.502 --> 10:05.437
Well, that is
certainly true.

10:05.471 --> 10:08.139
Aminifu had
much good on him.

10:08.174 --> 10:11.209
And now, you'll just have
to say it in Elephantese.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.478
I can't say it
in Elephantese.

10:13.512 --> 10:15.280
And do you know why?

10:15.314 --> 10:17.415
Because I'm
not an elephant.

10:20.486 --> 10:22.220
<i>I'm okay.</i>

10:22.254 --> 10:26.424
Simba, you may not be an
elephant, but you are king.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.426
And as king,
this is expected of you.

10:29.528 --> 10:33.031
And Aminifu
was a good friend.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.199
He deserves the best.

10:34.233 --> 10:36.334
Thanks, Nala.
Okay, Zazu.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.069
Once more, from the top.

10:39.271 --> 10:42.307
Of course, sire.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.112
<i>No.
Beehives in the path.</i>

10:47.146 --> 10:50.181
Just like you said, Ono.
Where are the elands?

10:54.387 --> 10:56.221
<i>They're on their way, Kion!</i>

10:56.255 --> 10:58.289
Uh, just around the bend!

10:58.324 --> 11:00.158
Okay. When they get here,

11:00.192 --> 11:03.228
we'll move them off the path
and across the fields

11:03.262 --> 11:05.096
far away from the bees.

11:05.131 --> 11:07.032
Hard to believe
something so small

11:07.066 --> 11:09.467
<i>- could bother something so big.
- Yeah.</i>

11:09.502 --> 11:11.302
Seems kind of silly.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.071
Moving a whole herd of elands

11:13.105 --> 11:14.439
just to avoid a few little bees?

11:14.473 --> 11:16.341
That was Queen Kiara's decree.

11:16.375 --> 11:20.145
Yeah, Queen Kiara's decree.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.280
She's only been queen for a day.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.149
I've been leading the Lion Guard

11:24.183 --> 11:26.184
for a lot longer than that.

11:26.218 --> 11:28.286
Kiara can tell me to do something.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.188
But she can't tell me how to do it.

11:30.222 --> 11:32.190
I say we move the bees.

11:32.224 --> 11:33.458
Move the bees?

11:33.492 --> 11:35.060
Move the bees?

11:35.094 --> 11:36.461
Yeah! Let's move the bees!

11:36.495 --> 11:38.129
What could go wrong?

11:43.269 --> 11:45.070
What are you guys running for?

11:45.104 --> 11:47.372
Bees taste even
better when they're mad!

11:49.308 --> 11:52.243
Maybe we should've diverted
the eland herd after all!

11:52.278 --> 11:54.045
<i>Don't worry about the elands!</i>

11:54.513 --> 11:56.347
<i>The elands!</i>

12:00.419 --> 12:02.053
<i>Heyvi kabisa!</i>

12:02.088 --> 12:03.909
<i>Incoming!</i>

12:06.492 --> 12:09.394
<i>There may have been
a small problem</i>

12:09.428 --> 12:13.398
- with the bees and the elands.
- A small problem?

12:13.432 --> 12:16.334
It wasn't a total disaster.

12:16.368 --> 12:20.004
Really? Looks
pretty total to me.

12:20.039 --> 12:23.141
Yeah, totally delicious.

12:23.175 --> 12:25.243
Admit it. I was right
about the bees

12:25.277 --> 12:26.444
and you were wrong.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.379
I admit it, Your Majesty!

12:28.414 --> 12:31.216
What's to admit?
The queen is always right.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.152
Especially giving titles
to her top advisors.

12:34.186 --> 12:38.056
- Dame Tiifu and Lady Zuri.
- What?

12:39.158 --> 12:42.093
Lady Tiifu and Dame Zuri?

12:42.128 --> 12:45.463
Well, we did manage to
round up the elands...

12:45.498 --> 12:48.399
- eventually.
- Most of them.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.069
Some of them didn't want
to come with us.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.504
I don't think
they liked us.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.406
Maybe next time you'll
listen to your queen.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.308
Next time?

12:57.343 --> 13:00.145
Yeah. Next time
I give you a decree.

13:00.179 --> 13:03.047
Or have you forgotten Dad
left me in charge?

13:03.082 --> 13:04.349
It's pretty hard
to forget.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.086
<i>You wouldn't believe it, Janja.</i>

13:08.120 --> 13:11.055
The whole sky.
It was filled with bees.

13:11.090 --> 13:14.192
I barely escaped without
getting stung myself.

13:14.226 --> 13:18.096
So with Simba in the
elephant territories,

13:18.130 --> 13:20.265
brother and sister
aren't getting along.

13:22.368 --> 13:25.436
Be a shame if
their family squabbles

13:25.471 --> 13:28.173
led to chaos
in the Pride Lands.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.341
From which we all
might profit.

13:31.443 --> 13:33.444
Mzingo, I need you
to deliver

13:33.479 --> 13:36.281
a message to the new queen.

13:39.251 --> 13:42.320
Itchy kala pano tou.

13:42.354 --> 13:44.088
Did I get it right that time?

13:44.123 --> 13:46.391
It's coming along, sire.

13:46.425 --> 13:48.092
You'll get it, Simba.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.328
Zazu, how much longer
until we get there?

13:50.362 --> 13:52.297
Hmm. Actually,

13:53.265 --> 13:54.499
we've arrived.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.268
Well, time for the tribute.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.477
<i>Queen Kiara.</i>

14:39.511 --> 14:43.414
Being queen obviously suits you.

14:43.449 --> 14:46.317
Mzingo.
What are you doing here?

14:46.352 --> 14:48.253
Nothing to fear, cub...

14:48.287 --> 14:51.022
I mean, Your Majesty.

14:51.056 --> 14:55.426
I simply come to bring you a
peace proposal on behalf of Janja.

14:56.528 --> 14:58.496
Janja wants peace?

14:58.530 --> 15:01.266
Oh, it's what he's
always wanted.

15:02.401 --> 15:07.238
Sadly, your brother
and his Guard, well...

15:07.273 --> 15:10.141
Forgive me
for saying so, my queen,

15:10.175 --> 15:14.178
but your brother can be quite stubborn.

15:14.213 --> 15:15.446
Ugh, tell me about it.

15:15.481 --> 15:18.149
But why didn't Janja
come himself?

15:18.183 --> 15:22.253
Janja's not exactly welcome
in the Pride Lands.

15:22.288 --> 15:25.256
He thought you might meet
on neutral ground.

15:25.291 --> 15:28.192
Say sunset tonight
at Broken Rock?

15:28.227 --> 15:32.130
You can discuss the terms
of your new peace agreement.

15:32.164 --> 15:37.135
You could usher in a new day
of peace for the Pride Lands.

15:37.169 --> 15:39.270
- Hmm?
- I'll think about it.

15:39.305 --> 15:41.472
That's all we ask.

15:44.410 --> 15:47.245
Kiara! You have to know
it's a trap!

15:47.279 --> 15:49.147
You would think that.

15:49.181 --> 15:52.150
Kiara, you can't
trust Mzingo.

15:52.184 --> 15:53.484
Or Janja!

15:53.519 --> 15:56.421
You just can't stand the
thought that I might be right.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.022
Like with the bees.

15:58.057 --> 16:00.024
But this is
completely different.

16:00.059 --> 16:02.193
You don't know
Janja like I do.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.395
I've had to run him off
so many times.

16:04.430 --> 16:07.098
Maybe that's why
he came to me.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.333
Now that I'm queen,
he knows...

16:08.367 --> 16:12.070
Kiara!
You're not really queen.

16:12.104 --> 16:14.205
I am the queen.

16:14.239 --> 16:17.308
And I'll do what I think
is best for the Pride Lands.

16:19.378 --> 16:22.447
If you're serious about this,
you're on your own.

16:23.349 --> 16:26.117
Argh.
Brothers.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.355
I can't believe it.
What is she thinking?

16:32.091 --> 16:35.259
Kion. Something's
troubling you.

16:37.096 --> 16:39.330
It's Kiara, Grandfather.

16:39.365 --> 16:42.166
She doesn't know what she's
getting herself into.

16:42.201 --> 16:46.004
Kion. Kiara is your sister.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.373
And for now,
she is your queen.

16:48.407 --> 16:53.311
And as your queen and sister,
she needs your support.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.113
Even if she's wrong?

16:55.147 --> 16:57.448
Especially if she's wrong.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.085
Hmm. Thank you, Grandfather.

17:05.324 --> 17:06.958
I better go talk to her.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.428
She's already gone?

17:10.462 --> 17:13.231
She said she had
some important meeting

17:13.265 --> 17:15.400
to go to... Somewhere.

17:15.434 --> 17:17.335
And you let her go alone?

17:17.368 --> 17:21.138
She's the queen.
We didn't let her do anything.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.339
She just did it.

17:22.374 --> 17:26.176
Ugh! Some advisors
you two are!

17:26.211 --> 17:27.412
What's wrong with him?

17:27.445 --> 17:30.281
Who cares?
He's not a queen.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.419
Lion Guard!
Kiara's in trouble!

17:34.453 --> 17:36.354
Till the Pride Lands' end...

17:36.388 --> 17:39.057
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

17:43.495 --> 17:47.165
And now,
His Majesty the King

17:47.199 --> 17:50.101
will say a few words
about my father.

17:50.135 --> 17:51.169
The king?

17:51.203 --> 17:52.370
Simba?

17:53.338 --> 17:54.338
His Majesty.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.143
You can do this, sire.

18:01.113 --> 18:04.015
I knew Aminifu a long time.

18:04.049 --> 18:07.385
And now that he has completed his
journey though the Circle of Life,

18:07.419 --> 18:10.221
I will remember him fondly.

18:12.157 --> 18:15.026
Because, as you
elephants say,

18:15.060 --> 18:18.029
"Eihe kaka pano tou."

18:18.063 --> 18:19.063
Oh.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.167
- Huh?
- Huh?

18:23.202 --> 18:24.969
Did I say he had good on him?

18:25.003 --> 18:28.172
I'm not sure, sire,
but I think you just said

18:28.207 --> 18:31.142
he had poop on him.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.178
I said what?

18:46.258 --> 18:48.326
It's true.

18:48.360 --> 18:52.096
He always did have
poop on him.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.398
And it always
made us laugh.

18:56.034 --> 18:59.303
He always made us laugh.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.939
It's nice to remember
the good times.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.075
Thank you,
Your Highness.

19:04.109 --> 19:06.377
Well, he had good
on him, too.

19:06.411 --> 19:10.181
He did. He truly
had good on him.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.283
But more poop.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.289
Hello?

19:19.224 --> 19:20.391
Hello?

19:20.425 --> 19:23.361
Queen Kiara. Welcome.

19:23.395 --> 19:27.098
I'm so happy
you considered my proposal.

19:27.132 --> 19:30.067
And you came alone.
Very smart.

19:30.102 --> 19:33.037
We can work out our deal,
leader to leader.

19:33.071 --> 19:34.305
Just the two of us.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.212
More or less.

19:41.246 --> 19:45.049
I think I just
re-considered your proposal.

19:48.153 --> 19:51.289
Going so soon?
But you're to be our guest.

19:51.323 --> 19:54.091
Soon as Simba hears
I have his daughter,

19:54.126 --> 19:56.060
he'll have no choice

19:56.094 --> 20:00.131
but to turn over the
Pride Lands to me.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.134
Or else!

20:03.168 --> 20:04.235
Or else!

20:11.343 --> 20:12.410
Hapana!

20:13.412 --> 20:15.146
Kiara's at Broken Rock!

20:15.180 --> 20:17.114
And she's surrounded
by hyenas!

20:17.149 --> 20:18.149
Follow me!

20:28.227 --> 20:29.260
Nice moves.

20:30.462 --> 20:33.064
Too bad you're
out here all on your own.

20:33.098 --> 20:35.032
<i>Get away from the queen!</i>

20:36.201 --> 20:39.237
- Kion! You're here?
- Of course!

20:39.271 --> 20:42.506
Aw, ain't this a
touching family reunion.

20:42.541 --> 20:46.244
Hey, you said these
two were fighting, Janja.

20:46.278 --> 20:48.312
Oh, we can
fight, all right.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.448
Think you can
take us both on?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.218
Six on two?
I'll take those odds.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.454
Twende Kiboko!

21:00.058 --> 21:04.262
- Till the Pride Lands' end...
- Lion Guard defend!

21:04.296 --> 21:06.230
Six on six.

21:07.399 --> 21:08.432
Forget it!

21:08.467 --> 21:12.136
Janja, Janja!
Wait for us!

21:13.305 --> 21:15.206
Thanks, guys.

21:15.240 --> 21:19.377
And Kion, you were right
about never trusting Janja.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.345
Hey, I can hear you.

21:21.380 --> 21:24.282
I should've listened to you
about the bees.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.284
Oh, sure.
Now he admits it!

21:30.389 --> 21:33.291
Mom! Dad!
Welcome back!

21:33.325 --> 21:35.059
How'd your tribute go?

21:35.093 --> 21:37.128
It went... It went...

21:37.162 --> 21:38.496
Everything turned out fine.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.498
How did ruling
the Pride Lands go?

21:40.532 --> 21:45.036
- Ruling the Pride Lands? It went...
- Any trouble?

21:45.070 --> 21:46.370
Well, uh...

21:46.405 --> 21:49.407
Yeah, but it wasn't anything
Kiara couldn't handle.

21:49.441 --> 21:51.442
I'm sure she's gonna be
a great queen.

21:52.277 --> 21:55.513
- Someday!
- Thanks, Kion.

21:55.547 --> 21:58.049
I never had any doubt.
