[gun firing]

00:06.582 --> 00:08.607
What do you want?
This island!

00:09.051 --> 00:11.110
Hey, man, this captain
saved my life once.

00:11.186 --> 00:13.120
lf he's in trouble,
l say we go in.

00:13.188 --> 00:14.280
No plane.

00:14.356 --> 00:15.983
Right. Get a boat.

00:18.260 --> 00:20.285
You've got a major
heroin refining operation...

00:20.362 --> 00:21.556
on this
nice little island...

00:21.630 --> 00:23.894
and l'm gonna cream
your whole operation.

00:23.999 --> 00:25.091
...dead man!

00:27.736 --> 00:30.364
Four men come out
of nowhere and think
they can defeat an army.

00:30.439 --> 00:31.838
We've done it before.

00:34.810 --> 00:37.643
Well, now that baby
is over 40 years old.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.839
And it is a beautiful tank.

00:40.683 --> 00:41.775
(Hannibal)
Fire!

00:44.520 --> 00:46.181
(B.A.)
From the A-Team, no love.

00:48.557 --> 00:51.082
(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:51.160 --> 00:52.650
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:52.728 --> 00:54.127
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:54.196 --> 00:55.527
These men promptly escaped...

00:55.597 --> 00:57.155
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:57.232 --> 00:58.824
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:58.901 --> 01:00.630
Today,
still wanted
by the government...

01:00.703 --> 01:02.637
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

01:02.705 --> 01:05.173
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

01:05.239 --> 01:08.801
and if you can find them,
maybe you can hire the A-Team.

02:34.830 --> 02:36.195
The boat is here.

02:36.265 --> 02:37.857
Look! lt's here!

02:38.367 --> 02:40.028
Come on!
Let's us go meet 'em.

02:43.839 --> 02:46.899
(fisherman)
Someone get the doctor!
Melo is hurt. A fishhook.

02:49.411 --> 02:51.902
[knocking on door]
Come quick, Captain.
Come quick. Melo is hurt.

02:51.980 --> 02:53.277
The fishing boat
brought him in.

02:53.348 --> 02:54.337
What is it?

02:54.416 --> 02:56.179
Melo is hurt.
The fishing boats
brought him in.

02:56.251 --> 02:58.048
l'll be right there.

03:01.089 --> 03:02.613
What have we got?
l got a hook.

03:02.691 --> 03:03.715
We can't clean it.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.953
No. lt's okay.
Come on up to my hut.

03:35.624 --> 03:37.148
[engines starting]

03:47.236 --> 03:48.430
[guns firing]

03:52.374 --> 03:54.740
Get inside! Clear! Clear!
Get in there!

03:58.947 --> 04:00.346
[guns firing]

04:38.954 --> 04:41.445
Mickey! Mickey, get down!

04:41.790 --> 04:42.984
[groans]

04:45.060 --> 04:46.152
Go for it.

04:52.467 --> 04:56.164
So. We have a soldier here.

04:56.571 --> 04:58.630
What do you want?
This island.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.316
(Vescari)
lt's beautiful.
(Ryker)
Mmm.

05:12.387 --> 05:14.446
The whole island
is sovereign nation.

05:15.857 --> 05:20.726
The whole place is ours,
Ryker. They ain't never gonna
touch us. Never.

05:21.063 --> 05:22.894
(Vescari)
lt's our place now.

05:23.398 --> 05:25.696
l'll take the jeeps up
through the mountain road...

05:25.767 --> 05:27.064
to the fortress.

05:39.614 --> 05:43.516
Get the boat that is on the
rock side of the island, huh?

05:44.720 --> 05:48.212
Go to Los Angeles.
Find the A-Team.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.983
When you get to 'em...

05:53.061 --> 05:55.723
give 'em these.
Tell them they're from...

05:56.198 --> 05:57.893
they're from
Captain Fallone...

05:58.200 --> 06:00.327
and that he needs them, now.

06:01.370 --> 06:02.962
Take care of yourself.

06:11.380 --> 06:13.245
(Face)
l don't believe this.

06:13.315 --> 06:17.012
''A-Team needed.
Captain Fallone in trouble.''

06:17.085 --> 06:19.849
Fallone?
Yeah. And it has an address.

06:20.822 --> 06:22.756
Yeah. See, it's gotta be
a joke.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.154
Fallone was the best
army medic we had in Nam.

06:25.227 --> 06:27.559
Yeah, l remember him.
He packed it in
after the war.

06:27.629 --> 06:30.860
He wanted to get away
from it all. Went to live
on some small island...

06:30.932 --> 06:31.990
somewhere l think.

06:32.067 --> 06:36.060
Just like Gulliver. Went out
into the Pacific Ocean
away from civilization.

06:36.271 --> 06:39.434
Met a small group
of fishermen. Now he's just
baskin' in the sun...

06:39.508 --> 06:41.032
and eatin' grapes the size
of watermelons.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.974
Hey, man, this captain
saved my life once.

06:43.045 --> 06:44.945
lf he's in trouble,
l say we go in.

06:45.013 --> 06:48.710
Wait, wait a minute.
l mean, what if this is
one of Decker's tricks?

06:49.117 --> 06:51.176
Well, maybe it is.
But what if it isn't?

06:51.253 --> 06:53.813
Yeah. l say
we gotta go in.

06:55.090 --> 06:57.251
Okay. But don't you think
we should know something...

06:57.325 --> 06:59.054
before we go into
a place like that?

06:59.127 --> 07:01.322
For instance, number one,
the temperature...

07:01.396 --> 07:05.662
it is 79 degrees, very humid,
with a condensation factor
of nineteen.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.467
Second of all, boots must
be worn at all times
because of the variety of...

07:09.538 --> 07:11.403
poisonous plant and animal
life. And third,

07:11.473 --> 07:13.566
and this is the most important
for you, B.A....

07:13.675 --> 07:17.839
we must beware
of the crocodilians
from the Cayman family.

07:18.313 --> 07:22.044
They have very large teeth
for very large animals.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.482
Hey, man, you gonna
keep going on with this?

07:24.553 --> 07:26.077
No. l'm done for now.

07:26.288 --> 07:30.247
Good. All right, Let's
assume for the moment,
that this is legit.

07:30.325 --> 07:31.519
Okay.
All right.

07:31.593 --> 07:34.255
Chances are, Decker reads
the same newspaper, right?

07:34.329 --> 07:35.455
Okay.
Right.

07:35.530 --> 07:38.192
So, we show up.
Bingo! He grabs us.

07:38.266 --> 07:40.894
Now, Face, did l ever
make it easy for Decker?

07:41.536 --> 07:45.233
Well, no.
Now, you see?
B.A., is the van ready?

07:45.307 --> 07:47.605
Guns and ammo.
We're ready to go.

07:49.678 --> 07:53.774
Boy, l sure hope we don't
run into any arborescent
calla-like Montrichardia.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.082
Oh. Especially one of those.

08:05.160 --> 08:09.221
Nothin' here.
lt's been over six hours.
l don't think they're showing.

08:09.998 --> 08:13.058
Get ready to move in.
Let's go.

08:14.836 --> 08:15.825
[car tires screeching]

08:15.904 --> 08:16.893
[engine revving]

08:31.887 --> 08:32.876
[brakes squealing]

08:57.979 --> 09:00.971
Please don't shoot.
Please don't shoot.
Who are you?

09:01.349 --> 09:03.909
My name is Mickey.
Wow! You're the A-Team?

09:04.219 --> 09:06.449
The A-Team? Us? Not quite.

09:08.356 --> 09:12.315
Did you put this ad
in the paper?
Yes. That's the one!
l need the A-Team.

09:12.394 --> 09:13.884
He needs the A-Team.

09:15.063 --> 09:18.965
l think he's legit.
The kid put an ad
in the paper for the A-Team.

09:19.734 --> 09:23.534
What the heck are you soldiers
doin' in here? Now,
this is a respectable hotel.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.072
You're scaring the guests.

09:25.140 --> 09:29.338
Only two to a room.
There must be twenty of you
around here.

09:29.878 --> 09:31.470
Now, come on, get out!

09:36.885 --> 09:40.480
So, Hannibal Smith...

09:42.724 --> 09:46.251
you didn't think l was gonna
fall for another one of
your phony disguises.

09:46.328 --> 09:49.991
Let go of my hair!
l don't believe this.

09:50.565 --> 09:54.194
This guy's not Smith.
Bring the kid downtown.

09:55.136 --> 09:58.902
Hey! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

10:02.344 --> 10:06.781
[shouting]
Let me go! Let me go!
Come on! Let me go!

10:08.250 --> 10:09.376
[gun firing]

10:20.061 --> 10:23.963
What do you say, Decker?
You know l love a challenge.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.792
Unfortunately, l have you
at a disadvantage.

10:27.302 --> 10:31.466
l was watchin' you
through the window.
You know, it's a hot day...

10:33.041 --> 10:36.010
and l hate to wear
disguises on hot days.

10:36.411 --> 10:40.245
l'm commanding you
under direct orders
of the United States Army...

10:40.315 --> 10:44.183
to put down your weapons
and place yourself
into my custody!

10:44.452 --> 10:46.147
Forget it! Grab the kid.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.559
Now, keep your head down.

10:54.663 --> 10:55.687
[gun firing]

11:00.969 --> 11:02.698
[tires squealing]

11:08.376 --> 11:09.365
[guns firing]

11:16.651 --> 11:17.640
[tires squealing]

11:35.804 --> 11:39.865
l have no idea who they were.
They just came onto
the island with their guns.

11:39.941 --> 11:43.934
When the captain said to find
the A-Team, the only thing
l could think of was the ad.

11:44.045 --> 11:45.979
Well, they say
it pays to advertise.

11:47.515 --> 11:49.642
lt's funny how the world
goes, you know.

11:50.385 --> 11:52.512
Fallone goes off
to this island...

11:53.288 --> 11:57.281
to help people, to get away
from war and the killing
and the hurt...

11:57.359 --> 12:00.226
and he winds up shot in
the arm and taken prisoner.

12:01.363 --> 12:03.888
Guys, l say we go for it.
Oh, terrific.

12:03.965 --> 12:07.366
Well, maybe Decker will
borrow a boat and come
join us for a luau.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.232
Can't.
lt's a sovereign nation.

12:09.304 --> 12:11.898
Why don't we get our
own island? l've always
wanted to start...

12:11.973 --> 12:14.874
a democratic society,
run my own country.

12:15.043 --> 12:17.637
Cool it, Murdock.
You can't even
run your own mind.

12:17.712 --> 12:19.043
Well, that wasn't very
nice of you, B.A.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.947
l was thinking of making
you an ambassador
to the coniferous trees.

12:22.016 --> 12:24.211
Maybe even the podocarpus.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.219
Yeah, maybe you can make me
Sergeant of Arms...

12:26.287 --> 12:27.845
so l can throw you
out of the country.

12:27.922 --> 12:31.551
When we get there, the first
thing we have to do is
find out where Fallone is.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.492
Mickey,
how big is this island?

12:33.595 --> 12:34.584
l made a map of the island.

12:34.729 --> 12:36.128
lt's about twenty miles long.

12:36.197 --> 12:38.722
Twenty miles. That's a lot
of land to cover.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.496
Which is why we need
a plan. And a plane.

12:41.636 --> 12:45.800
No plane, Hannibal. No plane.
Right. Get a boat.

13:07.395 --> 13:09.693
Just as l thought.
Sclerophyllous vegetation.

13:09.764 --> 13:12.927
lt's the perfect environment
for the vertebrate
class of reptile...

13:13.001 --> 13:17.370
Crocodylus niloticus,
better known as the crocodile.
So, watch your feet.

13:17.939 --> 13:20.066
You know, Murdock
has something with
all this research.

13:20.141 --> 13:22.609
lt's good to know
what you're going into.

13:23.044 --> 13:26.775
(B.A.)
Hey! Hey man! Where am l?

13:28.383 --> 13:32.046
l told you no plane, Hannibal!
Why you put me
on a plane, man?

13:33.054 --> 13:38.014
Well, now, B.A.
B.A., do you see a plane?

13:38.626 --> 13:41.857
Does anybody see a plane?
(Murdock)
No, sir. l don't see no plane.

13:42.130 --> 13:43.893
l don't believe you guys, man!

13:43.965 --> 13:48.368
Come on, B.A., this is
America. ln America, a man is
innocent until proven guilty.

13:48.436 --> 13:52.031
l mean, it's
in the constitution.
No plane, no guilt.

13:52.106 --> 13:55.769
Yeah. Come on, guys.
B.A., we need that
radio homing device.

13:56.411 --> 13:58.879
What a shame to ruin
such a beautiful suit.

13:58.947 --> 14:02.906
Yeah, well, if you're gonna be
a playboy millionaire,
you gotta look the part.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.379
Yeah.
There you go.

14:06.187 --> 14:10.681
Okay. Where? Shoe? My watch.
Oh, they'll
probably take that.

14:11.359 --> 14:14.453
See, they'll probably
search you very thoroughly.

14:16.130 --> 14:17.324
My ear, huh?

14:17.398 --> 14:21.835
Well, l was thinking,
like, someplace inside?

14:22.670 --> 14:25.366
lnside? lnside what?

14:28.943 --> 14:29.932
[scoffs]

14:30.211 --> 14:31.906
You're not serious.

14:33.948 --> 14:35.779
You want me to swallow this?

14:36.050 --> 14:38.348
l made it! You eat it!

14:38.419 --> 14:40.353
(Murdock)
You know, Face,
if you were really smart,

14:40.421 --> 14:41.513
you'd do what
we do at the VA.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.887
Put it under your tongue,
down the water,
make a gulping sound to...

14:43.958 --> 14:46.153
make them think
you swallowed it, but it's
still under your tongue.

14:46.227 --> 14:47.285
Now that's if
you're really smart.

14:47.362 --> 14:50.729
Murdock, we want Face
to swallow this.
l know.

14:51.266 --> 14:54.531
We'll be right behind you.
We'll follow you with
this homing device.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.229
Nothing can go wrong.

14:56.304 --> 14:59.569
Except the batteries
only last an hour.
That's all you got.

14:59.641 --> 15:01.575
An hour! l only got an hour!

15:02.143 --> 15:03.440
What happens if
they can't find me?

15:03.511 --> 15:05.035
What happens if
you lose track of me?

15:05.113 --> 15:08.310
No. This changes everything,
Hannibal. You never said
l only had an hour.

15:08.383 --> 15:12.615
Face! You're at your best
when you're under pressure.

15:13.087 --> 15:14.179
[chuckles]

15:18.426 --> 15:22.453
Damn! l got a schedule.
l want these men
moving faster.

15:25.633 --> 15:30.400
Okay, old man,
what are you doing?
l am looking around...

15:30.672 --> 15:34.938
and l don't see nothing
but a bunch of old women.

15:38.346 --> 15:42.112
We're workin' as hard
as we can. lt's hot and
some of us men are old.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.019
That's the last
of your water for the day.

15:46.354 --> 15:48.515
Now you have
something to work for.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.921
You want water,
you finish the field.

15:52.627 --> 15:54.925
But you can't.
We have children here.

15:55.129 --> 15:56.426
[groaning]

15:56.598 --> 16:01.399
This is my island!
l run it! l do what l want.

16:17.418 --> 16:20.319
Oh, Flipper.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.910
l'm empty.
Check him for lD.

16:47.448 --> 16:48.437
[muttering]

16:50.151 --> 16:53.143
Boy, what a party
you missed last night.

16:53.488 --> 16:56.855
Where are the others?
Others? Oh, yes.

16:57.659 --> 17:02.119
Well they must be
half way to Hawaii by now.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.864
The last thing
l remember was...

17:07.935 --> 17:10.494
kissing Flipper...

17:11.271 --> 17:14.469
and then washing up
on this beach.

17:14.876 --> 17:16.810
That's a nice outfit you have.

17:18.246 --> 17:22.376
Listen, could you
direct me to the nearest
American Express office...

17:22.817 --> 17:25.786
[engine revving]
l have to catch a flight
to Maui today.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.926
How did someone
get through security?

17:37.398 --> 17:40.265
Fell off a yacht
and washed ashore.
He seems clean.

17:41.969 --> 17:46.872
l want double guards
on the beach in case we have
anymore uninvited guests.

17:47.075 --> 17:48.736
(Ryker)
You want me to waste him?

17:48.810 --> 17:53.338
lf this is some kind
of set-up, l'd rather have
something to bargain with.

17:54.882 --> 17:56.611
Take him to the fortress.

18:00.822 --> 18:02.050
He' s moving.

18:33.755 --> 18:35.985
Not a sound, all right?

18:42.196 --> 18:45.563
Who are you?
Did Mickey send you?
What?

18:45.867 --> 18:49.564
Mickey. Mickey got off
the island. Dr. Fallone
sent him for help.

18:49.904 --> 18:52.998
Who are you?
l'm Kalani.
l work for Dr. Fallone.

18:53.941 --> 18:57.399
Well, where is he?
All right, take me to him.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.889
Captain. Captain!

19:21.669 --> 19:24.638
Peck?
Yeah. We're here. The A-Team.

19:24.705 --> 19:25.797
Thank God.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.170
[panting]

19:29.977 --> 19:32.172
How's Mickey?
ls the boy all right?
Yeah, he's fine.

19:32.246 --> 19:33.645
ls he okay?
He's fine.

19:35.183 --> 19:36.411
Did he get
any medical attention?

19:36.484 --> 19:38.577
We ran out of antibiotics.
l did everything l could.

19:38.653 --> 19:40.086
We're gonna have to
get him outta here.

19:40.154 --> 19:41.621
l'm not sure l'm gonna
let you move him.

19:41.689 --> 19:43.213
Listen, lady,
there's something
you should understand.

19:43.291 --> 19:45.020
l'm giving the orders.

19:45.092 --> 19:48.152
l'm not even sure who you are
or what you're doing here.

19:48.529 --> 19:51.589
Well, trust me. They should
be here any time now.

19:51.666 --> 19:53.133
Who should be here?

19:56.204 --> 19:59.139
(B.A.)
The signal's coming in
strongest behind this wall.

20:01.075 --> 20:04.238
(Hannibal)
Well, they've probably got
Face and the captain together.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.312
What do you see
around the other side?

20:06.380 --> 20:08.473
(B.A.)
Three guards
are on the south side.

20:08.549 --> 20:10.881
Two at the front gate.
What's our plan?

20:18.893 --> 20:20.326
l got two jeeps
up at the north gate...

20:20.394 --> 20:21.622
and a duce
and a half at the front.

20:21.696 --> 20:23.425
What's your plan, Colonel?

20:28.669 --> 20:32.332
We'll blow up this wall,
grab Face and the Captain...

20:33.241 --> 20:37.041
take out the guards and we'll
jump on that duce and a half
and ram through the gate.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.102
How'd you know
that truck was gonna be there?

20:39.180 --> 20:41.614
Well, l didn't,
until Murdock told me.

20:42.016 --> 20:45.042
You didn't have no plan!
You didn't have no plan
till now.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.211
B.A....

20:46.687 --> 20:50.418
it's not when you have a plan,
it's when you have a plan.

20:52.760 --> 20:53.886
Ten seconds!

21:03.971 --> 21:05.598
[explosion]

21:09.277 --> 21:12.735
Let's go! Come on, move.
Let's go.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.373
(Kalani)
l'm not going anywhere without
supplies for the doctor.

21:15.449 --> 21:16.643
Come on, let's move!

21:22.023 --> 21:23.354
[Fallone coughing]

21:27.762 --> 21:28.820
Let's go.

21:28.963 --> 21:30.931
Who's she?
l'll explain later.

21:30.998 --> 21:31.987
(Fallone)
Face!

21:34.168 --> 21:37.137
You son of a gun.
You got here.
What did you think?

21:38.072 --> 21:39.334
[guns firing]

21:39.407 --> 21:40.840
(Hannibal)
Cover us!

22:13.307 --> 22:16.936
l don't know!
They're using explosives
and heavy firepower.

22:21.315 --> 22:22.907
[gun firing]

22:25.820 --> 22:28.516
Ryker, take half the men
and work around the far end
of the camp!

22:28.589 --> 22:30.523
l'll take the others
and work toward you.

22:30.591 --> 22:33.082
We'll have 'em trapped
between us.
Word.

22:38.566 --> 22:39.760

23:12.299 --> 23:13.926
[tires screeching]

23:24.879 --> 23:26.938
(Vescari)
Those men weren't from
any gang we know.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.572
They were trained commandos.

23:28.649 --> 23:31.482
(Ryker)
Maybe they were the Feds.
Without air support, no way.

23:31.552 --> 23:35.420
Whoever they were, they were
working independent to get
the doctor out.

23:36.157 --> 23:40.491
They got to be connected
to the village.
Ryker, gather the men.

23:40.694 --> 23:42.958
We're going into the village.
Right.

23:58.312 --> 24:00.109
(Hannibal)
ls everybody all right?

24:00.848 --> 24:03.214
Well, that all depends,
Colonel.

24:03.451 --> 24:04.713
Lookie, lookie.

24:04.852 --> 24:07.412
Tell them not to shoot.
Don't shoot!

24:12.126 --> 24:14.993
Well, now, that baby
is over 40 years old.

24:15.362 --> 24:16.351
Yeah.

24:16.630 --> 24:20.157
United States Army.
Well, at least it was
on the right side.

24:21.902 --> 24:24.462
Hey, man, come here.
We ain't going nowhere.

24:24.672 --> 24:25.798
The axle's busted.

24:27.875 --> 24:30.366
The captain's losing blood and
he's got a really high fever.

24:30.444 --> 24:31.741
l don't think
that ride helped.

24:32.146 --> 24:34.011
At least we got him
out of here alive.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.480
What are we gonna do now?

24:35.549 --> 24:37.414
First, we'll take
a look at the map.

24:38.452 --> 24:41.444
Murdock, B.A.,
rig up a stretcher,
and take the doc to the plane.

24:41.922 --> 24:45.119
Plane? See! l told you
there was a plane!
Get off! Get off of me!

24:45.459 --> 24:48.553
l'm far too delicate to have
your ugly mud-sucking hands
all over me!

24:49.864 --> 24:50.956
B.A.

24:51.398 --> 24:54.856
B.A., you know
this is practically
an archeological find?

24:55.202 --> 24:57.636
Hey, man! Get down from there
and help me make a stretcher!

24:57.705 --> 24:59.673

25:58.065 --> 26:01.762
Now you just take it easy,
Doc. We're gonna take you
back to the States.

26:02.369 --> 26:03.529
You're a good man, B.A.

26:03.604 --> 26:06.402
Hey, man.
You saved a dude's life once.

26:07.174 --> 26:10.507
Everybody thought he wasn't
gonna make it, but he did.
Thanks to you.

26:11.545 --> 26:13.877
And that dude was me.
Do you remember?

26:14.181 --> 26:15.239
l don't.

26:15.482 --> 26:18.815
There were so many men in Nam.
You teach yourself
to forget their faces.

26:26.026 --> 26:28.995
You wear that chain.
lt's for good luck.
Lead Pipe Singe, huh, B.A.?

26:29.396 --> 26:30.385

B.A.

26:31.298 --> 26:34.563
B.A., You're not gonna
believe this! You're not
gonna believe this!

26:36.070 --> 26:38.470

No. No.

26:42.276 --> 26:45.268
Hey, man, get that thing
away from me! You know
l can't stand lizards!

26:45.346 --> 26:48.042
lt's no lizard.
That's a crocodile.

26:48.115 --> 26:51.050
You know, just like
that cartoon crocodile,
Wally Gator.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.342
See you later.

26:52.419 --> 26:55.445
My fist's gonna see you later
if you don't get that lizard
away from me!

26:55.522 --> 26:57.615
Now get back there and take
care of Captain Fallone...

26:57.691 --> 26:58.919
and be careful with him.

26:58.993 --> 27:02.121
Don't worry, big fella.
Wally and l are gonna take
good care of the doc.

27:08.102 --> 27:12.004
the village is about
two miles from here.
We can get help there.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.537
The village? That's suicide.

27:13.607 --> 27:15.734
That's the first place
Vescari's going to look.

27:15.809 --> 27:18.209
lf he finds you there,
he'll destroy the place.

27:18.646 --> 27:21.080
My plans do not
include being found.

27:21.248 --> 27:22.875
Well, l hope you know
what you're doing.

27:22.950 --> 27:26.010
Vescari goes there twice a day
to the village
to pick up workers.

27:26.153 --> 27:29.088
Lady, have a little faith.

28:17.404 --> 28:21.966
Where is the captain,
and where are his friends?

l wish those men had
never come.

the truth or you're dead.

[boy continues groaning]

28:56.610 --> 28:58.202
Push up the schedule.

29:01.515 --> 29:03.005
We'll have to work them
in three shifts.

29:03.083 --> 29:06.177
Then we'll do it. l want
the stuff off this island
as soon as we can.

29:06.487 --> 29:07.749
Move them.

29:09.890 --> 29:11.187
Move them out!

29:27.908 --> 29:29.842
lt's all clear.
They've taken the men away.

29:29.910 --> 29:31.002
Great.

29:31.078 --> 29:33.706
My son, Mickey,
is he all right?
Oh, yeah, he's fine.

29:34.047 --> 29:35.981
You've got a brave
little kid there.

29:36.083 --> 29:37.072
Yeah.

29:37.451 --> 29:39.612
He's real tough.
He's got lots of courage.

29:39.686 --> 29:41.085
When will the planes
come back for us?

29:41.155 --> 29:42.782
Will they take
us all out of here?

29:42.856 --> 29:44.585

Sorry, ma'am.
The A-Team don't run.

And if you people leave,
this guy's got you beat.

29:47.194 --> 29:49.560
He's right.
This island's your home.

29:49.630 --> 29:51.495
We intend to see
that it stays that way.

29:51.732 --> 29:54.701
Four men come out of nowhere
and think they can defeat
an army.

29:54.768 --> 29:57.896

refined, get it cut and
get it packaged.

all over this place.
l want the stuff out.

the stuff out clean.
We'll do it.

32:26.153 --> 32:30.180
Then l'm gonna find those men
and stuff them in boxes!

32:31.158 --> 32:32.250
Hands up.

Up!

to say, ''Hi, there''...

32:39.533 --> 32:40.966
and l find
you've got a major...

32:41.034 --> 32:44.128
heroin refining operation
right down the hall
on this nice little island.

32:44.204 --> 32:46.138
And l noticed you've got
the natives chained up...

32:46.206 --> 32:47.400
so you can raise
your own poppies...

32:47.474 --> 32:50.568
so you won't have to import
the crude from Asia.
lt's very efficient.

32:50.644 --> 32:54.273
But, you know, l don't know
which l hate the most,
hard narcotics, or slavery.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.880
So l'm coming
back tomorrow...

32:57.284 --> 32:59.252
and l'm gonna cream
your whole operation.

l'm not really.

Good. Good.

34:13.659 --> 34:16.561

The best side for an attack
is the west side.

34:17.397 --> 34:20.025
But this Vescari
is gonna be something else.

34:20.534 --> 34:22.228
Yeah. Hannibal,
l should know better...

34:22.302 --> 34:23.530
than to ask this question...

we're coming back?

let it slip out, yeah.

34:29.309 --> 34:30.333
Yeah.

34:30.409 --> 34:33.038
l thought the element
of surprise was too much
to ask for.

34:33.612 --> 34:37.242
Well, Murdock'll be in,
in the morning.
He'll have supplies and ammo.

34:37.751 --> 34:39.844
We will attack
exactly at noon.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.414

sneaking around the compound.

that you won't hurt
the villagers.

their attack at noon
tomorrow...

35:07.414 --> 35:10.076
How are they armed?
(Kalani)
A few revolvers.

35:10.183 --> 35:13.050
Some automatics. Nothing much.

35:15.989 --> 35:18.890
Go back to the village.
Do what you have to do.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.423
Act as if nothing
has happened.

35:22.562 --> 35:24.860
You'll let
the villagers live in peace?

35:25.665 --> 35:27.394
You have my word.

35:39.646 --> 35:41.375
l want everyone
working all night.

35:41.448 --> 35:44.076
l want all the explosives
we have. All the ammo.

35:44.618 --> 35:46.449
We hit first thing
in the morning.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.712
When they won't expect it.

35:51.625 --> 35:54.458
What about the girl?
The girl?

35:56.663 --> 35:58.722
l feel very sorry for her.

36:11.011 --> 36:13.070
Face, how much gas
have we got?

36:13.180 --> 36:15.774
We got these two cans here
and a full tank in the truck.

36:16.416 --> 36:18.907
You're actually gonna try
and get this tank working?

36:19.085 --> 36:21.110
We're not gonna try.
We're gonna do it.

36:21.521 --> 36:23.512
(Hannibal)
Hey, B.A., how we doing?

36:24.991 --> 36:26.219
Not too good, man.

36:26.293 --> 36:29.456
All the hoses
are rotted and the
tubing is rusted through.

36:29.629 --> 36:31.119
But we should be able
to use the truck's.

36:31.198 --> 36:32.825
(Face)
Colonel, l got a problem.

36:32.899 --> 36:35.868
The battery in the truck
is shot. We got no juice.

36:36.303 --> 36:39.272
Well, how would the battery
from an airplane work?

36:39.973 --> 36:43.170
Why didn't l think of that?
We'll rip off Murdock.

36:43.677 --> 36:44.803
He'll never forgive me.

37:09.002 --> 37:10.401
Mission accomplished, sir.

37:10.570 --> 37:13.971
Captain Fallone was dropped
off safely at the hospital
and l brought some...

37:14.608 --> 37:16.007
some tank ammo with me.

37:17.043 --> 37:18.101
But, sir...

37:18.278 --> 37:22.271
you and the other guys,
you haven't by any chance
come across some...

37:23.650 --> 37:27.313
small worms, water insects,
toads or tadpoles, have you?

37:27.487 --> 37:30.945
'Cause, Wally Gator's getting
hungry and that coffee
l put out for him...

37:31.057 --> 37:33.491
it doesn't set
with him too well.
He's getting jittery.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.585
(Hannibal)
First things first, Murdock.

37:36.663 --> 37:39.826
The tank, Murdock, the tank.

37:39.900 --> 37:40.924
The tank!

37:41.001 --> 37:44.402
The tank. The tank. The tank.
And it is a beautiful tank!

37:45.372 --> 37:49.934
lt is inspirational.
This is survival
in its purest form.

37:50.543 --> 37:54.604
A motionless body,
resting for 40 years.

37:55.181 --> 37:58.582
Patient, waiting for
discovery to breathe
life into its very soul.

37:58.652 --> 38:02.247
l'm gonna breathe my fist
into your soul if you don't
stop all this jibber jabber!

38:02.322 --> 38:04.290
(Hannibal)
Murdock, go to work.

38:04.424 --> 38:05.413
Work.

38:06.826 --> 38:07.850
Work.

40:02.542 --> 40:03.941
You got it?

40:05.078 --> 40:06.067
lt's a beaut.

40:18.858 --> 40:22.294
You are created.
You are living.

40:22.796 --> 40:24.491
You are whole again!

40:25.031 --> 40:26.555
Hey, man, that's a tank.

40:26.766 --> 40:30.065
And that's all it is.
Pay no attention
to him, Wally.

40:30.437 --> 40:32.132
The man has constraints
on his brain.

40:32.205 --> 40:34.332
He has no understanding
of the finer things...

40:34.407 --> 40:35.738
in life like we do.

40:35.809 --> 40:38.334
You know, Face,
l like having a tank.

40:38.411 --> 40:41.005
Yeah. And won't
Vescari be surprised?

40:41.081 --> 40:42.070
[chuckles]

40:42.182 --> 40:43.171
And won't he be surprised...

40:43.249 --> 40:46.116
when we attack from the east,
about 45 minutes before noon?

40:46.753 --> 40:49.119
l thought you were making
your attack from the west.

40:49.189 --> 40:52.852
Yeah, well, l just told
you that so when you
told Vescari...

40:52.992 --> 40:55.187
he'd be in the wrong place
when we attacked today.

40:56.062 --> 40:58.155
How'd you know?
l'm a light sleeper.

40:58.531 --> 40:59.657
l followed you.

40:59.732 --> 41:02.394
l was afraid of what Vescari
might do to the villagers...

41:02.869 --> 41:04.359
if you didn't succeed.

41:05.004 --> 41:07.666
l was just doing what l
thought was best for everyone.

41:08.108 --> 41:10.338
Yeah, aren't we all?

41:12.045 --> 41:13.103
Well, don't worry
about it, lady.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.441
You did what
l wanted you to do.

41:14.514 --> 41:15.879
All right, let's mount up.

41:33.833 --> 41:35.300
[rumbling]

41:39.105 --> 41:41.403
War is hell,
Wally Gator, isn't it?

41:41.474 --> 41:44.102
We know about hell
and we know about war, right?

41:44.711 --> 41:48.340
(Murdock)
[ Wally Gator is a swinging
alligator in the swamp [

41:49.315 --> 41:52.648
[ He's the greatest
percolator when he really
starts to romp [

41:52.719 --> 41:54.619
[ See ya later,
Wally Gator [[

42:09.502 --> 42:13.165
We're loaded and ready,
Vescari. They should be
coming over that hill.

42:14.841 --> 42:17.002
They don't have a chance.

42:29.189 --> 42:30.417
(Hannibal)
Load it!

42:30.490 --> 42:31.718
[metallic clanging]

42:50.310 --> 42:51.334
Fire.

42:51.844 --> 42:53.607
[explosion]

42:55.715 --> 42:56.807
[gun firing]

42:58.818 --> 42:59.807
Stand by.

43:00.687 --> 43:01.915
(Hannibal)
Fire!

43:14.434 --> 43:15.628
[gun firing]

43:23.443 --> 43:24.637
(Hannibal)
Fire!

43:39.826 --> 43:40.918
[guns firing]

44:56.202 --> 44:57.430
Any questions?

45:17.924 --> 45:21.052
Well, Captain,
you two are looking fine.

45:21.394 --> 45:24.625
Thanks to the A-Team.
We'll never be able
to repay you.

45:25.098 --> 45:27.828
Well, you just keep the sun
shining on this island...

45:28.301 --> 45:30.929
l might retire here, Doc.
No better place.

45:37.910 --> 45:42.404
[ Wally Gator, Wally Gator,
Wally Gator, Wally Gator [

45:42.482 --> 45:45.144
[ Wally Gator, Wally Gator [[

45:45.952 --> 45:47.783
Hey, man, where you
going with that thing?

45:48.654 --> 45:50.246
He's going back
to the States with us.

45:50.323 --> 45:52.814
l mean, he's homeless,
he's an orphan.
l can't leave him here.

45:52.892 --> 45:55.656
How do you know he's an
orphan? Suppose the mama's
looking for him.

45:55.728 --> 45:57.127
See, that's how much
you know, B.A.

45:57.196 --> 45:59.664
The book says that once
a baby croc is hatched...

45:59.866 --> 46:01.959
he's on his own.
He's gotta fend for himself.

You gotta see this.
