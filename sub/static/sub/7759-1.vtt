WEBVTT

00:10.111 --> 00:11.312
- * ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR

00:11.345 --> 00:13.247
* ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX *

00:13.281 --> 00:14.515
* SHAKE IT, DUDE

00:14.548 --> 00:22.490

00:35.436 --> 00:37.505

00:39.707 --> 00:42.810
- * I'M FLYING

00:42.843 --> 00:46.780
* FLYING ABOVE THE RAIN

00:46.814 --> 00:50.151
* I CAN SEE AGAIN

00:50.184 --> 00:54.555
* FAR BEYOND THE PAIN

00:54.588 --> 00:57.325
* I'M FLYING

00:57.358 --> 01:02.196
* MY SOUL'S IN FREE FLIGHT

01:02.230 --> 01:05.366
* THE DARKNESS

01:05.399 --> 01:10.671
* IS TURNING INTO LIGHT

01:10.704 --> 01:12.206
* I'M NOT GOING BACK

01:12.240 --> 01:13.574
- YOU KNOW,
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY

01:13.607 --> 01:16.610
THE GRAND CANYON
OR BIG SUR,

01:16.644 --> 01:19.813
BUT I THINK SOME
OF THE FINEST VISTAS

01:19.847 --> 01:21.849
TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE
IN THESE UNITED STATES

01:21.882 --> 01:24.818
ARE RIGHT HERE
IN PITTSBURGH.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.387
- LOOKS PRETTY BARREN TO ME.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.521
- OH, COME ON.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.323
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE

01:29.357 --> 01:32.393
IN THIS VAST PANORAMA
OF SWEATY BODIES

01:32.426 --> 01:34.528
YOU'RE JUST DYING
TO HAVE REJECT YOU.

01:34.562 --> 01:37.198
- IT'S NOT THEM.
IT'S ME.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.533
IT'S TOO SOON.
I'M STILL IN MOURNING.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.570
- WELL, IT'S TIME TO TAKE OFF
THE WIDOW'S WEEDS.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.638
AFTER ALL,
EVEN JACKIE MANAGED

01:44.672 --> 01:46.140
TO GET UP OFF ALL FOURS,

01:46.174 --> 01:49.777
MARRY SOME RICH OLD MAN,
AND GO SHOPPING AGAIN.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.245
AT LEAST TRY.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.414
- * ABOVE THIS ROCKY GROUND

01:53.447 --> 01:55.583
* OH

01:55.616 --> 01:58.619
* I'M FLYING

01:58.652 --> 02:00.888
- HIM.

02:00.921 --> 02:01.922
- WHO?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.757
- OVER THERE.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.759
THE RED AND BLUE SHIRT,

02:05.793 --> 02:08.229
BLACK HAIR,
BIG BUTTON EYES,

02:08.262 --> 02:09.497
CUTE, LITTLE,
TURNED-UP NOSE.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.365
- OH, HE'S ADORABLE.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.501
- HE'S HOT.
[chuckles]

02:13.534 --> 02:15.669
- HE'S, UH...

02:15.703 --> 02:16.904
both: MICHAEL?

02:16.937 --> 02:17.938
- MICHAEL.
- OH, MY GOD.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.907
- HEY, MICHAEL!
- MICHAEL!

02:19.940 --> 02:21.575
- HEY!
- MICHAEL!

02:21.609 --> 02:24.378
- MICHAEL!
- OH, MY GOD!

02:24.412 --> 02:25.879
[laughs]

02:25.913 --> 02:29.483
- IT'S YOU.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.252
- I FIGURED
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.253
- HOW'D YOU GUESS?

02:32.286 --> 02:33.721
- WELL, IT WAS EITHER THIS
OR MIDNIGHT MASS.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.588
- OH, WELL--
- SO, YEAH.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.524
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
YOU WERE COMING?

02:36.557 --> 02:38.259
- IT WAS A SPUR
OF THE MOMENT THING.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.328
I--DAVID TOOK HANK CAMPING.

02:40.361 --> 02:43.331
- AND SO YOU FIGURED YOU'D DO
A LITTLE CAMPING OF YOUR OWN.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.266
- [laughs]
OH, MAN.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.235
- OH, LOOK AT YOU.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.869
YOU LOOK ADORABLE.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.638
AND HOT.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.607
DOESN'T HE LOOK HOT, TED?

02:53.641 --> 02:54.975
- LET'S HAVE A DRINK.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.510
- OH, YEAH.
- COME ON.

02:56.544 --> 03:01.482
*

03:01.515 --> 03:02.716
- SO HOW LONG
ARE YOU IN TOWN FOR?

03:02.750 --> 03:04.285
- JUST LONG ENOUGH
TO SEE YOU GUYS

03:04.318 --> 03:06.420
AND MY MOM
AND MY UNCLE VIC AND...

03:06.454 --> 03:07.821
all: BRIAN.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.291
- OH, THERE'S NO POINT
IN LOOKING FOR HIM, SWEETIE.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.592
- HE'S NOT HERE.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.995
- NO, OF COURSE NOT,
NOT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.966
- HE'S IN THE BACK ROOM.

03:18.999 --> 03:19.967
- [grunts]

03:20.000 --> 03:21.769
- OH, HEY, TODD.
HOW'S IT GOING?

03:21.802 --> 03:24.872
- HEY. FINE.

03:35.015 --> 03:39.853
[men moaning]

03:39.887 --> 03:41.655
- HARDER, HARDER.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.504
- HEY, MIKEY.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.472
- IS THAT ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY?

03:58.506 --> 04:01.375
- NO.
COVER YOUR TEETH.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.377
- I'VE BEEN EMAILING YOU
AND LEAVING YOU MESSAGES

04:03.411 --> 04:05.012
PRACTICALLY EVERY DAY
FOR THE LAST MONTH,

04:05.045 --> 04:07.348
AND YOU NEVER ANSWERED.
- BUSY, BUSY.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.749
- WHAT,
UP TO YOUR OLD TRICKS?

04:08.782 --> 04:09.950
- NEVER OLD ONES

04:09.983 --> 04:12.653
AND NEVER
THE SAME ONES TWICE.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.490
OKAY, GUYS.

04:16.524 --> 04:19.560
YOU CAN TAKE A BREAK.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.862
- WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE OKAY.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.897
- OH, NOT JUST OKAY.
I'M--

04:23.931 --> 04:26.500
I'M FABULOUS.

04:26.534 --> 04:31.639
IN FACT, I'M THE MOST
FABULOUS FAG IN PITTSBURGH.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.774
THAT IS
IF IT'S POSSIBLE

04:33.807 --> 04:38.579
TO BE FABULOUS
IN PITTSBURGH.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.914
[sighs]
DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY "E"?

04:40.948 --> 04:41.915
- MM-HMM.
- HERE YOU GO.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.751
- TRY IT.
- HERE.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.720
- ALL RIGHT.
- GO ON, TAKE IT.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.590
- SO WHO TOLD YOU I WAS HERE,
ROSENCRANTZ OR GUILDENSTERN?

04:49.623 --> 04:53.394
- I THINK I COULD HAVE
FIGURED IT OUT ON MY OWN.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.695
- OH, SHIT.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.831
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO NAIL
THAT FUCKER ALL NIGHT.

04:57.865 --> 05:01.935
- WHEN AM I
GOING TO SEE YOU?

05:05.406 --> 05:07.074
- I WOULDN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY,
SWEETIE.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.343
- HE'S CUT HIMSELF OFF
FROM EVERYONE.

05:09.377 --> 05:11.812
- EVERYONE, THAT IS, EXCEPT
FOR EVERY SLUT IN PITTSBURGH

05:11.845 --> 05:14.682
WITH A SMOOTH ASS
OR A 9-INCH COCK.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.417
- SO IN OTHER WORDS,
DESPITE WHAT HAPPENED,

05:16.450 --> 05:18.919
IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL
FOR MR. KINNEY.

05:18.952 --> 05:22.556
- BUT HEY,
WHEN YOUR BOY TOY GETS BROKEN,

05:22.590 --> 05:25.025
YOU GET ANOTHER TOY,
RIGHT?

05:25.058 --> 05:28.061
WELL, HERE WE ARE.
HOME, SWEET DUMP.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.797
- IT IS SO GREAT
TO BE BACK.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.432
- AH, I WOULDN'T GO
THAT FAR,

05:31.465 --> 05:34.134
AFTER THOSE PHOTOS YOU
EMAILED US OF YOUR NEW PLACE.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.937
- WELL, I MAY NOT HAVE
A POOL AND AN ATRIUM,

05:36.970 --> 05:38.439
BUT I'VE GOT
A STOPPED-UP SINK

05:38.472 --> 05:40.841
AND A HALF-DEAD
RUBBER TREE PLANT.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.510
- HE'S TRYING TO GROW
HIS OWN CONDOMS.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.645
- [laughs]

05:44.678 --> 05:47.114
OH, BABY,
YOU MUST BE SO HAPPY.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.783
- YEAH. HANK AND DAVID
ARE GETTING VERY CLOSE NOW.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.085
AND WE GET TO DO
ALL THESE COOL THINGS TOGETHER.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.854
WE GET TO GO BICYCLING
IN FOREST PARK,

05:53.887 --> 05:55.589
AND WE GET TO GO
TO CANNON BEACH.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.791
AND WE'VE MADE
SOME REALLY GREAT NEW FRIENDS.

05:57.825 --> 05:58.792
IT'S REALLY--

05:58.826 --> 06:01.529
- YOU HAVE FRIENDS?

06:01.562 --> 06:04.465
- WELL, THAT'S, UH--
THAT'S NICE.

06:04.498 --> 06:07.501
- OH, STOP IT. YOU KNOW NOBODY
COULD REPLACE YOU GUYS, HMM?

06:07.535 --> 06:08.702
- YEAH, WELL,
I'M AFRAID

06:08.736 --> 06:10.471
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO REPLACE YOU.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.605
- WHAT?

06:11.639 --> 06:13.106
- IF I DON'T FIND
A NEW ROOMMATE SOON,

06:13.140 --> 06:14.575
I'M GOING TO BE FORCED
TO MOVE

06:14.608 --> 06:18.011
INTO THE HOME
FOR INDIGENT HOMOS.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.114
- WELL, HAVE YOU
BEEN LOOKING?

06:21.148 --> 06:23.617
- I'M HERE ABOUT THE ROOM.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.018
- I'M HERE ABOUT THE ROOM.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.186
- [moaning]

06:26.219 --> 06:29.823
- I'M HERE.
- OH, YEAH! WHOO!

06:29.857 --> 06:31.792
HIGH AND LOW.

06:31.825 --> 06:35.563
ONLY NO ONE MEASURES UP.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.698
- MAYBE YOU NEED TO RETHINK
THE INTERVIEW PROCESS.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.534
- RIGHT NOW
WE HAVE A GUEST.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.203
WELCOME HOME, BABY.

06:43.236 --> 06:47.908
[thunder]

06:47.941 --> 06:50.410
- [grunts]

07:01.555 --> 07:03.524
- [snorts]

07:03.557 --> 07:05.926
- CRUMMY NIGHT?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.528
- [clears throat]

07:07.561 --> 07:10.531
HELL, WHAT'S A LITTLE RAIN?

07:10.564 --> 07:13.033
- HOW ABOUT SOME HOT TEA?

07:13.066 --> 07:18.606
OR I COULD FIX YOU UP
SOME OF THAT SOUP IN A CUP,

07:18.639 --> 07:23.811
ALTHOUGH IT'S GOT ENOUGH SODIUM
TO STIFF A HORSE.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.479
OH, BY THE WAY, MIGUEL,
YOU KNOW,

07:25.513 --> 07:27.080
THE ONE WHO'S HERE TUESDAYS
AND THURSDAYS?

07:27.114 --> 07:28.816
HE WAS TOSSING
THE BALL WITH HIM TODAY.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.952
YEAH, SAID HIS HAND
WAS IMPROVING.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.921
BUT HE STILL HAS
THESE OUTBURSTS

07:33.954 --> 07:35.489
WHEN HE GETS FRUSTRATED.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.691
- WELL, THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN GIVE HIM.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.127
- OH, DRUGS CAN'T FIX
EVERYTHING.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.963
- [scoffs]
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

07:42.996 --> 07:45.566
- IF YOU ASK ME,

07:45.599 --> 07:47.768
WHAT WOULD HELP HIM
THE MOST IS

07:47.801 --> 07:50.704
IF HE KNEW
THAT YOU CAME HERE EVERY--

07:50.738 --> 07:52.873
- NO.
[lighter clicks]

07:52.906 --> 07:55.275
- [clears throat]

07:55.308 --> 07:56.577
UH, NO.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.881
- WHO MADE UP
THE FUCKING RULE

08:00.914 --> 08:04.552
THAT YOU CAN'T SMOKE
IN A HOSPITAL?

08:11.892 --> 08:15.262
- COME AND GIVE
YOUR MOTHER A HUG!

08:15.295 --> 08:17.731
- PROMISE TO LET ME GO
THIS TIME?

08:17.765 --> 08:19.132
- EAGLE SCOUT'S HONOR.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.267
AND THEY'RE ALL FAGS,
YOU KNOW.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.903
[laughs]

08:22.936 --> 08:26.273
MY BABY!

08:26.306 --> 08:29.009
CHRIST!

08:29.042 --> 08:30.611
YOU'RE A FUCKING SKELETON.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.912
- WHAT THE HELL HAVE
YOU BEEN EATING OUT THERE?

08:31.945 --> 08:33.246
NUTS AND BERRIES?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.848
[laughter]

08:34.882 --> 08:36.750
- I CAN SEE I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO FATTEN YOU UP.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.152
I'M GOING TO GET YOU
THE BUTCH BOTTOM SPECIAL, HUH?

08:39.186 --> 08:40.754
- STACK-O-JACKS.
- JACKS.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.022
- DOUBLE SAUSAGE AND EGGS,

08:42.055 --> 08:43.824
A BIG SLICE OF CHERRY PIE
A LA MODE.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.627
- RIGHT.
- DOUBLE B.S. FOR MY KID.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.596
- ARE YOU TRYING TO FATTEN ME UP
OR GIVE ME A STROKE?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.598
- [laughs]
- WHAT'S ALL THIS?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.199
- CHRIS HOBBS'S SENTENCING
IS NEXT WEEK.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.668
- THE JUDGE IS A REAL ASSHOLE.
- YEAH.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.103
WE'RE CALLING EVERYBODY
WE CAN.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.005
PFLAGers, ACLUers,

08:58.038 --> 08:59.940
WE'RE GOING TO PACK
THAT COURTROOM.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.042
MAKE SURE HE KNOWS
WE'RE HOLDING HIM ACCOUNTABLE.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.945
- JUSTIN'S VERY LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU LOOKING AFTER HIM.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.280
- WELL, THAT'S MORE THAN I CAN
SAY ABOUT YOUR FUCKING FRIEND.

09:07.314 --> 09:08.649
HE HASN'T BEEN
TO SEE HIM ONCE.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.217
- EVERY TIME
WE VISIT JUSTIN,

09:10.250 --> 09:12.620
ALL HE EVER ASKS IS,
"WHERE'S BRIAN?"

09:12.653 --> 09:14.722
- GETTING HIS DICK SUCKED,
THAT'S WHERE'S BRIAN.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.323
- I'M NOT STICKING UP
FOR HIM.

09:16.356 --> 09:19.026
BUT MAYBE IT'S LIKE
THOSE VIETNAM VETS

09:19.059 --> 09:20.661
WHO WITNESSED
ALL THOSE ATROCITIES,

09:20.694 --> 09:23.964
JUST TOO PAINFUL
FOR HIM TO FACE.

09:23.997 --> 09:24.765
- MM-HMM.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.200
- WHAT, SEEING
A POOR, HURT KID?

09:27.234 --> 09:28.335
- YOU WEREN'T THERE
THAT NIGHT.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.738
YOU DIDN'T SEE BRIAN
IN SHOCK,

09:30.771 --> 09:33.140
WITH ALL THAT BLOOD
ALL OVER HIM.

09:33.173 --> 09:36.844
IT'S LIKE HE'D HAD
THE SHIT BEAT OUT OF HIM TOO.

09:36.877 --> 09:40.948
- IF YOU ASK ME,
HE'S STILL AN ASSHOLE.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.283
- OKAY, I GUESS IT'S TIME
TO GET TO THE BEAUTY PARLOR.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.885
- YEAH, GET OUR HAIR DONE.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.353
- GET OUR MANICURES.
- PICK UP OUR DRESSES.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.355
- BE READY
WHEN OUR DATES ARRIVE.

09:48.388 --> 09:51.124
- WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.693
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
WHILE I WAS GONE

09:52.726 --> 09:54.061
THAT I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.363
- DON'T WORRY, MICHAEL.
WE'RE STILL LESBIANS.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.898
- OH, PHEW.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.700
- IT'S MY SISTER'S WEDDING.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.769
- AND THE LESS SAID,
THE BETTER.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.236
- RIGHT. YEAH.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.337
- HERE, BONE-BUTT.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.841
[laughs]
START ON THESE.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.878
OH, MWAH.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.881
COFFEE.
- COFFEE.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.755
- DOES HE ALWAYS PUSH HIMSELF
THIS HARD?

10:21.789 --> 10:23.857
- EVEN WHEN HE WAS A KID.

10:23.891 --> 10:28.662
HE WAS SO DETERMINED
TO RIDE HIS TWO-WHEELER.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.698
HE FELL A HUNDRED TIMES.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.099
HIS KNEES WERE
A BLOODY MESS, BUT...

10:32.132 --> 10:34.167
[sighs]

10:34.201 --> 10:37.270
HE KEPT AT IT
TILL HE LEARNED HOW TO STAY UP.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.774
HE HASN'T CHANGED.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.977
IF HE WANTS SOMETHING,
HE WON'T STOP TILL HE GETS IT.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.278
- WELL,
WHATEVER IT IS NOW

10:45.312 --> 10:47.180
THAT'S MAKING HIM WANT
TO STAY ON TOP,

10:47.214 --> 10:49.082
IT'S PAID OFF.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.418
I'M SENDING HIM HOME.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.886
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.988
- FUCK! SHIT!
FUCK.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.026
- ARE YOU SURE
HE'S READY?

10:59.059 --> 11:00.994
- I WANT TO SEE HIM HERE
THREE TIMES A WEEK

11:01.028 --> 11:03.831
FOR THE NEXT MONTH
FOR OUTPATIENT THERAPY.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.800
AND CALL ME
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.979
[classical music playing]

11:19.012 --> 11:21.481
*

11:21.514 --> 11:23.183
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.218
I'M DRESSED
FOR A FUCKING FUNERAL.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.788
- CLOSE TO IT.
HETERO WEDDING.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.923
- CAN'T YOU TWO GIVE UP
BABYLON FOR ONE NIGHT?

11:29.957 --> 11:30.958
- I DID, AND LOOK.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.325
I'M HAVING
WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.894
[laughter]

11:38.465 --> 11:41.735
- OH. WELL, IT'S TOO BAD
YOU'RE NOT STRAIGHT.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.737
YOU COULD...

11:43.771 --> 11:45.172
REALLY SCORE BIG-TIME.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.807
- IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE,

11:46.840 --> 11:48.876
BUT IN THIS PARALLEL UNIVERSE,
YOU'RE ACTUALLY HOT.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.144
- WHOO-HOO.
LUCKY ME.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.213
- PINK CHAMPAGNE.
YEAH.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.215
YEAH, THAT'S TOO NELLY
EVEN FOR ME.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.417
- NOT BAD...

11:57.450 --> 11:59.119
FOR A DOUCHE.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.922
- LOOK, I'M SORRY TO MAKE YOU
PRETEND TO BE OUR DATES,

12:01.955 --> 12:03.891
BUT LYNNETTE INSISTED
MEL AND I

12:03.924 --> 12:06.159
NOT DRAW ATTENTION
TO OURSELVES.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.194
- WHAT DID SHE THINK
WE WERE GOING TO DO?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.329
PERFORM CUNNILINGUS ON TOP
OF THE WEDDING CAKE?

12:09.362 --> 12:11.264
- I PROMISED
WE'D FOLLOW WEDDING ETIQUETTE.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.967
- YEAH, WELL, I'VE READ
MISS MANNERS COVER TO COVER,

12:14.001 --> 12:15.168
AND NOWHERE DOES IT STATE

12:15.202 --> 12:17.537
THAT ONE MUST SUBJUGATE
ONE'S SEXUALITY

12:17.570 --> 12:21.441
EVEN AT THE BRIDE'S REQUEST.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.944
WOW, IS HE HOT.
- COME BACK HERE.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.412
- WHAT'S YOUR POSITION
ON FUCKING USHERS?

12:25.445 --> 12:26.947
- PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.382
PREFERABLY
NOT DURING THE CEREMONY.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.318
- THERE SHE IS.
- AH, DADDY.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.453
- THERE'S MY GIRL.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.522
- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU.

12:35.555 --> 12:36.857
HELLO, MELANIE.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.391
- MR. AND MRS. PETERSON.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.161
- THIS IS TED, EMMETT.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.262

- OH, RON, STOP.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.405
- WELL, DON'T TELL ME, NANCY.
TELL LYNNETTE.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.108
THREE WEDDINGS
IN FIVE YEARS...

12:55.142 --> 12:57.077
THIS IS THE LAST ONE
I'M PAYING FOR.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.847
- THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
THE LAST TIME.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.348
[laughter]

13:01.381 --> 13:02.349
- MR. PETERSON.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.384
- OH, THERE'S OUR CUE.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.587

[overlapping chatter]

13:15.395 --> 13:18.932
- [clears throat]

13:22.402 --> 13:25.338
- I LEFT YOU
FOUR MESSAGES.

13:26.506 --> 13:30.077
- I TOLD YOU,
BUSY, BUSY.

13:35.548 --> 13:38.118
WANT SOME DINNER?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.286
- THIS IS DINNER?

13:39.319 --> 13:42.189
- IT'S JUST THE ESSENTIAL
ELEMENTS OF A HEALTHY DIET:

13:42.222 --> 13:43.991
SALT, SATURATED FAT,

13:44.024 --> 13:45.125
ALCOHOL.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.259
- I'M NEVER EATING AGAIN.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.861
MY MOM
PRACTICALLY FORCE-FED ME

13:47.895 --> 13:49.196
THE ENTIRE LIBERTY DINER MENU.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.530
- WELL, WHO TOLD YOU
TO EAT IT?

13:50.563 --> 13:52.265
- WELL, WHAT WAS
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

13:52.299 --> 13:54.534
- SAY NO.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.502
- YOU KNOW
IT MAKES HER HAPPY.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.937
- THERE YOU HAVE IT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

13:56.970 --> 13:58.271
PROOF POSITIVE

13:58.305 --> 13:59.339
THAT MAKING
OTHER PEOPLE HAPPY

13:59.372 --> 14:04.077
CAN CAUSE NAUSEA,
SEVERE CRAMPS, EVEN DIARRHEA.

14:04.111 --> 14:07.080
- GOT ANY TUMS?

14:11.651 --> 14:13.954
- YOU KNOW WHAT TUMS
IS SPELLED BACKWARDS?

14:13.987 --> 14:16.924
both: SMUT.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.160
- WHY THE FUCK
ARE YOU HERE?

14:20.193 --> 14:21.962
- I TOLD YOU, I LEFT YOU
A BUNCH OF MESSAGES,

14:21.995 --> 14:23.230
AND YOU NEVER
CALLED ME BACK.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.431
- I MEAN, OUT OF ALL
THE HOLIDAY DESTINATIONS

14:24.464 --> 14:25.565
YOU COULD HAVE CHOSEN...

14:25.598 --> 14:29.402
IBIZA, PUERTO VALLARTA,
SIX FLAGS OVER FUCKING TULSA,

14:29.436 --> 14:32.639
WHY THE PITTS?
- I MISSED IT. IT'S MY HOME.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.975
- NOT ANYMORE IT'S NOT.
YOU'RE JUST A VISITOR HERE NOW.

14:35.008 --> 14:39.980
[scoffs] JUST A SIGHTSEER
OF YOUR FORMER LIFE.

14:40.013 --> 14:43.083
SO NOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN
YOUR MOM AND THE BOYS AND ME,

14:43.116 --> 14:45.185
WHO'S NEXT ON THE TOUR?

14:45.218 --> 14:48.989
- I THOUGHT
I'D GO SEE JUSTIN.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.291
HOW'S HE DOING?
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

14:51.324 --> 14:52.625
- WELL, YOU WOULD
IF YOU WENT TO SEE HIM.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.527
HOW ABOUT YOU COME WITH ME?
- WHAT FOR?

14:54.561 --> 14:56.263
- IT MIGHT MAKE HIM HAPPY.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.998
- I JUST TOLD YOU,
MAKING OTHER PEOPLE HAPPY

14:58.031 --> 14:59.099
CAN BE HAZARDOUS
TO YOUR HEALTH.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.001
- SO CAN MAKING
YOURSELF MISERABLE.

15:01.034 --> 15:06.373
- LOOK, SAVE THE WORRIED WIFE
ROUTINE FOR THE DOC.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.275
AND COME WITH ME TO WOODY'S.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.509
- I DON'T WANT TO--

15:09.542 --> 15:10.944
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO WOODY'S.

15:10.978 --> 15:14.381
- COME ON.
IT'S PART OF THE TOUR.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.283
ON YOUR LEFT,
A NOSTALGIC RECREATION

15:16.316 --> 15:17.284
OF YOUR MISSPENT YOUTH.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.153
YOU'LL LOVE IT.

15:20.187 --> 15:23.123
- YEAH, SURE.

15:24.191 --> 15:27.927
- I STINK.
I NEED A SHOWER.

15:57.724 --> 16:01.194
[water running]

16:01.228 --> 16:02.395
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT JUSTIN'S CONDITION?

16:02.429 --> 16:04.197
[overlapping chatter]

16:04.231 --> 16:05.698
WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP
TO JUSTIN?

16:05.732 --> 16:07.634
IS HE ALL RIGHT?
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

16:07.667 --> 16:08.768
- OW, SHIT!

16:08.801 --> 16:11.038
- MRS. TAYLOR,
IS JUSTIN ALL RIGHT?

16:11.071 --> 16:13.040
WILL YOU BE GOING
TO THE SENTENCING?

16:13.073 --> 16:15.508
- JESUS CHRIST,
WHAT WAS THAT?

16:15.542 --> 16:17.610
- THEY WERE WAITING FOR US
WHEN WE GOT HOME.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.279
SOMEONE FROM THE HOSPITAL
MUST HAVE TOLD THEM

16:19.312 --> 16:21.648
JUSTIN WAS BEING RELEASED.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.750
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

16:23.783 --> 16:26.586
- WHAT?
OH, JESUS.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.655
SOME ASSHOLE OUT THERE
BUMPED INTO ME

16:28.688 --> 16:31.124
AND MADE ME SPILL MY MARINARA
ALL OVER MYSELF.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.094
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO
ON THE ANGEL HAIR, NOT YOU.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.029
- WAIT TILL YOU SEE
ALL THE SUPPORTERS

16:36.063 --> 16:38.131
WE HAVE GOT COMING
TO THE COURTROOM.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.800
- DEBBIE, I JUST BROUGHT
JUSTIN HOME.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.371
I CAN'T SUBJECT HIM
TO ALL THAT.

16:44.404 --> 16:48.375
- OH, SURE.
I UNDERSTAND.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.443
- WHOA, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE
TO ALL THIS TROUBLE.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.279
- IT WASN'T ANY TROUBLE.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.281
SHE COOKED IT.
[both laughing]

16:54.314 --> 16:57.250
- I MADE JUSTIN'S FAVORITE,
CHICKEN PARMESAN.

16:57.284 --> 16:58.718
- WELL, I'M SURE
HE'S GONNA LOVE IT,

16:58.751 --> 17:00.553
IF I CAN JUST
GET HIM TO EAT.

17:00.587 --> 17:04.091
- OF COURSE HE'LL EAT.
- OF COURSE I'LL EAT.

17:06.326 --> 17:10.097
- SUNSHINE.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.165
- SWEETHEART, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TAKING A NAP.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.266
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

17:13.300 --> 17:16.803
- I'M FINE.
DON'T I LOOK IT?

17:16.836 --> 17:18.271
- GOOD AS NEW.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.572
- BETTER.

17:19.606 --> 17:23.676
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.813
YOU KNOW, I HAVE PRAYED
FOR THIS MOMENT

17:26.846 --> 17:31.218
TO SEE YOU STANDING THERE,

17:31.251 --> 17:33.820
TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

17:35.522 --> 17:38.391
SHIT!

17:38.425 --> 17:41.328
YOU COME AND GIVE ME
A KISS, HONEY.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.829
- OH!

17:44.464 --> 17:46.599
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- SWEETHEART.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.169
HONEY,
IT'S JUST MARINARA SAUCE.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.837
IT'S OKAY.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.473
- I'M SORRY.
- MM-HMM.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.577
- SO WHY DON'T
WE ALL SIT DOWN AND EAT?

17:59.246 --> 18:01.881
- YEAH, I'LL NUKE UP
THE REST OF THE SAUCE,

18:01.914 --> 18:03.283
WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.118
- AND I'LL WASH
THE BABY FIELD GREENS,

18:05.152 --> 18:07.554
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS WEEDS.
- [chuckles]

18:07.587 --> 18:09.256
- HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST RUN UPSTAIRS

18:09.289 --> 18:10.623
AND GET CLEANED UP?

18:10.657 --> 18:12.625
- OKAY.

18:17.364 --> 18:21.134
"HONEY, SWEETIE,
SUNSHINE."

18:21.168 --> 18:23.336
JUST 'CAUSE CHRIS HOBBS
FUCKING BASHES ME IN THE HEAD,

SUDDENLY EVERYBODY WANTS
TO INFANTILIZE ME.

- YOU COULD HAVE DIED, YOU KNOW.
- I WAS THERE.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.145
- THEY'RE GOING TO FREAK
WHEN THEY FIND OUT YOU'RE GONE.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.514
- I LEFT A NOTE.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.250
"BACK SOON.
LOVE AND KISSES."

18:41.654 --> 18:44.591
[indistinct chatter]

18:50.697 --> 18:53.866
- HURRY UP,
WE CAN'T BE LATE.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.535
- WILL YOU BE OKAY?

18:55.568 --> 18:58.871
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I HAVE TO FIND HIM.

19:39.846 --> 19:40.813
- HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

19:40.847 --> 19:42.782
- AH! DON'T TOUCH ME.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.817
NO, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.787
[horn honking]

19:53.693 --> 19:55.695
- SO...

19:55.728 --> 19:58.565
HOW ARE THE BOYS
OF PORTLAND?

19:58.598 --> 20:00.700
I BET
WITH ALL THAT RAIN,

20:00.733 --> 20:03.836
THEY ALL HAVE PERFECT PEACHES
AND CREAM CHEEKS.

20:03.870 --> 20:09.776
- I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO DO A BUTT CHECK.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.911
BESIDES, DAVID AND I
HAVE BETTER WAYS

20:11.944 --> 20:14.013
OF SPENDING OUR EVENINGS.
- LIKE WHAT?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.582
- WE COOK, AND WE READ,

20:15.615 --> 20:16.816
AND WE LISTEN TO MUSIC.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.618
- AND YOU CHECK
EACH OTHER'S PULSES

20:18.651 --> 20:20.920
TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE?

20:20.953 --> 20:24.424
YOU KNOW, IF IT WAS ME,
I'D BE OUT EVERY NIGHT

20:24.457 --> 20:25.992
TOPPING THE TALL TIMBER.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.261

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.763
- [laughs mockingly]

20:32.399 --> 20:34.767
BUT, MIKEY,
TELL ME.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.003
I NEED TO KNOW.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.872
DOES A LUMBERJACK OFF?

20:43.910 --> 20:47.514
- WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON?

20:47.547 --> 20:50.016
- NOTHING THE FUCK
IS GOING ON.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.751
- YOU'RE
A FUCKING FALL-DOWN MESS.

- I'M BEAUTIFUL.

20:52.785 --> 20:53.620
I'LL ALWAYS BE BEAUTIFUL,

20:53.653 --> 20:56.789
YOU SAID THAT YOURSELF.
YOU WANT SOME?

20:56.823 --> 20:59.426

FROM EVERYONE INCLUDING ME.

YOU'RE DRINKING,

SEEN YOU BEFORE.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.467

21:07.500 --> 21:08.768
- MAYBE YOU NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEONE.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.737
- WHAT ARE YOU?
MY GODDAMN MOTHER?

21:10.770 --> 21:12.472
YOU GO BACK
WHERE YOU BELONG

21:12.505 --> 21:16.509
AND READ AND COOK AND LISTEN
TO MUZAK WITH DAVID,

21:16.543 --> 21:19.011
AND I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.516
- WHY HAVEN'T YOU GONE
TO SEE JUSTIN?

21:26.653 --> 21:27.554
- [clears throat]

21:27.587 --> 21:30.723
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO FOR HIM.

21:46.573 --> 21:47.674
- GET AWAY FROM ME.

21:47.707 --> 21:48.808
- YEAH.
- WOW.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.076
- HEY, THEY SEND THAT GUY
TO JAIL?

21:50.109 --> 21:51.844
- HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- DON'T TOUCH ME.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.680
- GIVE HIM SOME ROOM.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.716
- ARE YOU OKAY?

21:56.749 --> 21:57.950
- WEREN'T YOU IN A COMA
OR SOMETHING?

21:57.984 --> 22:00.553
- JUSTIN,
IT'S ME, MICHAEL.

22:00.587 --> 22:01.821
- IS HE OKAY?

22:01.854 --> 22:04.857
[indistinct chatter]

22:13.633 --> 22:17.904
- WELL, ARE YOU JUST GOING
TO FUCKING STAND THERE?

22:17.937 --> 22:19.706
[The Golden Ones plays]

22:19.739 --> 22:23.042
- * 'CAUSE WE ARE THE ONES,
THE ONLY ONES *

22:23.075 --> 22:25.678
* WE ARE THE ONES,
THE GOLDEN ONES *

22:25.712 --> 22:28.114
- THE FIRST MARRIAGE, SHE WAS
REGISTERED AT TIFFANY'S.

22:28.147 --> 22:30.116
THE SECOND, POTTERY BARN.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.852
THE THIRD, THE BIG Q.

22:32.885 --> 22:35.755
- [laughs]
PATHETIC, ISN'T IT?

22:35.788 --> 22:39.659
STRAIGHT PEOPLE
AND THEIR SILLY LITTLE RITUALS.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.160
- OH, COME ON, MEL,
YOU KNOW IF IT WAS LEGAL

22:41.193 --> 22:43.396
FOR YOU AND LINDSAY
TO GET MARRIED, YOU WOULD.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.097
- WELL, WE CAN'T,
SO WHAT'S THE POINT?

22:45.131 --> 22:46.966
- THE BRIDE REQUESTS
NO SMOKING.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.902
- OH, FUCK THE BRIDE.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.571
- HELLO, MELANIE.

22:51.604 --> 22:54.941
- LYNNETTE.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL WEDDING.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.909
- JUST LIKE
THEY'VE ALL BEEN.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.911
- THANK YOU.
- THE CHICKEN WAS DELICIOUS.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.112
- IT WAS A CAPON.

23:00.146 --> 23:03.149
- WELL, IT TASTED
LIKE CHICKEN.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.286
- I WAS JUST SAYING,

23:07.319 --> 23:09.622
I BET YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO THAT HONEYMOON.

23:09.656 --> 23:10.990
WELL, WHERE ARE YOU OFF
TO THIS TIME?

23:11.023 --> 23:13.793
- BORNEO.
- BORNEO. AH.

23:13.826 --> 23:17.063
- DON'T THEY HAVE
A LOT OF PIGS THERE?

23:17.096 --> 23:18.531
- WELL,

23:18.565 --> 23:21.167
I'M HAVING A MUCH BETTER TIME
THAN I THOUGHT.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.736
- WELL, TIME TO CUT
THE CAKE.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.538
[laughing]
AND YOU...

23:25.572 --> 23:27.674
YOU PROMISED TO TOAST
THE HAPPY COUPLE.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.175
- RIGHT. I DID.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.778
- BUT BEFORE YOU DO,

23:31.811 --> 23:33.513
I JUST WANT
TO THANK YOU.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.081
- FOR TOASTING MY OWN SISTER
AT HER WEDDING?

23:35.114 --> 23:36.483
- [chuckles]
NO.

23:36.516 --> 23:40.920
I MEAN
FOR NOT EMBARRASSING ME.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.656
YOU KNOW, NOT THAT I HAVE
ANYTHING AGAINST MELANIE.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.525
AND YOU KNOW
I ADORE GUS,

23:45.558 --> 23:48.661
BUT CONSIDERING
IT IS MY WEDDING.

23:48.695 --> 23:51.130
- THIRD WEDDING.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.733
- AFTER ALL, IT'S JUST--
DIDN'T SEE ANY REASON

23:53.766 --> 23:55.735
FOR PEOPLE
TO BE SUBJECTED TO--

23:55.768 --> 24:00.072
- AN UNDIGNIFIED DISPLAY
OF MY PRIVATE LIFE.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.142
- MM.

24:07.880 --> 24:08.981
[overlapping chatter]

24:09.015 --> 24:10.249
- EXCUSE ME.

24:10.282 --> 24:14.587
EVERYONE, I'M LINDSAY,
LYNNETTE'S SISTER.

24:14.621 --> 24:17.223
AND I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE
HER AND HER HUSBAND

24:17.256 --> 24:20.593
ON THIS SPECIAL OCCASION.

24:20.627 --> 24:23.029
[applause]

24:27.667 --> 24:31.170
TO STAND IN FRONT
OF YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS

24:31.203 --> 24:33.806
AND TO DECLARE
YOUR LOVE AND COMMITMENT

24:33.840 --> 24:35.575
IN THE EYES OF GOD
AND THE LAW

24:35.608 --> 24:40.547
IS A PRIVILEGE...
NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.282
I KNOW, BECAUSE I'VE SHARED
A COMMITMENT WITH MY PARTNER

24:43.315 --> 24:45.117
FOR SIX WONDERFUL YEARS,

24:45.151 --> 24:49.889
EVEN THOUGH
WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

24:49.922 --> 24:53.926
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BE.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.127
BUT THAT SHOULDN'T STOP
TWO PEOPLE

24:55.161 --> 24:56.763
FROM DOING
WHAT THEY TRULY WANT,

24:56.796 --> 24:59.065
SHOULD IT?

24:59.098 --> 25:01.734
SO I'D LIKE TO ASK
MY BELOVED,

25:01.768 --> 25:06.138
MELANIE...

25:06.172 --> 25:09.776
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

25:11.010 --> 25:12.244
- OH!

25:12.278 --> 25:14.113
- [laughs]

25:18.050 --> 25:21.153
[guests murmuring]

25:21.187 --> 25:23.222
- THE DOCTOR SAID
IF CHRIS HOBBS HAD HIT ME

25:23.255 --> 25:27.627
A FRACTION OF AN INCH
THIS WAY OR THAT WAY

25:27.660 --> 25:30.162
OR AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE
OR EVEN A LITTLE BIT HARDER,

25:30.196 --> 25:31.998
I'D BE A COMPLETE VEGETABLE.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.733
OR DEAD.

25:33.766 --> 25:37.336
AS IT IS, HE ONLY DAMAGED
THE CEREBRAL MOTOR STRIP.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.672
- IS THAT WHERE THEY DRAG-RACE
THROUGH YOUR BRAIN?

25:39.706 --> 25:40.773
- NO.

25:40.807 --> 25:41.908
IT'S THE PART
OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX

25:41.941 --> 25:42.975
THAT CONTROLS MOTOR SKILLS.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.912
- I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
I ATTENDED THE EIGHTH GRADE.

25:45.945 --> 25:46.913
- THEY HAD TO DRILL
THROUGH MY SKULL

25:46.946 --> 25:48.180
TO RELEASE ALL THE BLOOD.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.049
- COOL.

25:50.082 --> 25:53.119
- THEY SAY
I MAY NEVER DRAW AGAIN.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.722
- YEAH, WELL,
THEY'RE ALWAYS TELLING PEOPLE

25:55.755 --> 25:57.890
THEY'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
OR DRAW AGAIN

25:57.924 --> 26:00.793
OR PISS AGAIN
SO THAT WHEN YOU FINALLY DO,

26:00.827 --> 26:02.829
YOU'LL THINK THEY'RE GENIUSES,
AND THEY CAN CHARGE YOU

26:02.862 --> 26:05.832
WHATEVER THE FUCK
THEY WANT.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.001
[sighs]

26:10.236 --> 26:15.341
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
COME AND SEE ME?

26:15.374 --> 26:18.678
- WHAT FOR?

26:18.711 --> 26:20.813
- CONSIDERING THAT I WAS
IN A COMA FOR TWO WEEKS

26:20.847 --> 26:22.815
AND REHAB FOR A MONTH,

26:22.849 --> 26:27.754
TRYING TO RELEARN HOW TO THROW
A FUCKING WIFFLE BALL.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.622
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT
TO REGAIN THE AGILITY

26:29.656 --> 26:30.823
AND THE STRENGTH
IN YOUR HAND,

26:30.857 --> 26:32.692
I SUGGEST JERKING OFF
SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.

26:32.725 --> 26:35.194
IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.395
- YOU SHOULD HAVE
AT LEAST CALLED TO SEE

26:36.428 --> 26:37.897
IF I WAS STILL ALIVE.

26:37.930 --> 26:41.868
- I'M SURE I WOULD HAVE HEARD
IF YOU WEREN'T.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.403
BESIDES, I'M NOT
YOUR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.838
I'M NOT
YOUR TRAUMA SPECIALIST.

26:45.872 --> 26:47.006
I'M NOT EVEN
YOUR GODDAMN MOTHER

26:47.039 --> 26:48.074
SITTING THERE HOLDING
YOUR HAND.

26:48.107 --> 26:51.243
I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING
I COULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU.

26:57.684 --> 27:00.653
- I STILL DON'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.024
LAST THING I DO REMEMBER
IS YOU TELLING ME

27:05.057 --> 27:09.295
THAT YOU WOULDN'T COME
TO MY PROM.

27:09.328 --> 27:12.799
BUT THEY SAID
THAT YOU SHOWED UP AFTER ALL

27:12.832 --> 27:16.335
AND THAT WE DANCED TOGETHER
AND THAT IT WAS AMAZING.

27:18.037 --> 27:21.140
DAPHNE SAID
THAT WE WERE AMAZING.

27:23.075 --> 27:27.013
- WE WERE ALL RIGHT.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.982
- SHIT.

27:31.217 --> 27:35.154
I WISH
I COULD REMEMBER THAT.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.422
AND THEN,

27:36.455 --> 27:40.960
I WALKED WITH YOU
BACK OUT TO YOUR JEEP.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.729
AND THAT'S
WHEN CHRIS HOBBS

27:42.762 --> 27:44.163
CAME OUT
WITH THE BASEBALL BAT AND--

27:44.196 --> 27:45.431
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.299
- I CAN'T.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.302
THIS IS JUST STUFF
THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.271
IT'S LIKE...

27:52.304 --> 27:56.275
A STORY THAT HAPPENED
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

27:56.308 --> 28:00.246
- YEAH, WELL, I CAN REMEMBER.
I CAN REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

28:06.753 --> 28:11.057
I SAW HIM.

28:11.090 --> 28:14.060
HE WAS COMING AFTER YOU
WITH THE BAT.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.868
BUT HE WAS MOVING TOO FAST,
AND YOU WERE TOO FAR AWAY.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.836
JUSTIN!

28:27.874 --> 28:30.810
I RAN.

28:30.843 --> 28:34.914
BUT THERE WAS NO TIME
TO STOP IT.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.084
AND THEN HE SWUNG.

28:38.117 --> 28:41.153
[thud]

28:41.187 --> 28:45.191
AND IT WAS TOO LATE.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.960
THERE WAS NOTHING
I COULD DO.

28:54.834 --> 28:58.237
AND THEN YOU JUST LAID THERE
ON THE COLD CEMENT.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.773
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

29:00.807 --> 29:03.843
OH...GOD!

29:05.544 --> 29:08.514
- IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.797
- HMM.

29:24.831 --> 29:27.967
- IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.255
- OH, GOD.

29:49.288 --> 29:52.024
THAT OLD BIDDY WHO WRESTLED ME
FOR THIS THING,

29:52.058 --> 29:54.560
SHE HAD ONE HELL OF A GRIP.

29:54.593 --> 29:59.231
- MMM.
- TRY THIS.

29:59.265 --> 30:02.368
- MMM.
[laughs]

30:02.401 --> 30:04.536
LET ME GIVE A PIECE OF THIS
TO MY ROOMMATE,

30:04.570 --> 30:06.906
EVEN THOUGH HE'S HAPPILY
MARRIED, YOU KNOW.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.975
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY IF YOU PUT
A PIECE OF WEDDING CAKE

30:09.008 --> 30:11.177
UNDER YOUR PILLOW,
YOU'LL GET--

30:11.210 --> 30:13.112
YOU'LL GET ICING
ALL OVER YOUR PILLOWCASE.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.881
[laughter]

30:14.914 --> 30:15.948
ALL RIGHT,
NOW WHY DON'T YOU

30:15.982 --> 30:19.485
SHOW YOURSELF RIGHT INTO
MY BEDROOM, THROUGH THERE.

30:19.518 --> 30:20.586
- OKAY.

30:20.619 --> 30:23.822
- I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN ONE MINUTE.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.195
- [moaning]

30:38.537 --> 30:41.440
- THANKS.

30:41.473 --> 30:44.243
- FOR WHAT?

30:44.276 --> 30:47.880
- THE RIDE.
SAVING ME.

30:47.914 --> 30:51.050
- I DIDN'T SAVE YOU.

30:51.083 --> 30:54.120
- I MEANT TONIGHT.

30:55.254 --> 30:59.091
SO WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN?

30:59.125 --> 31:01.160
- YEAH, YOU'LL SEE ME.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.628
- WELL, DON'T WAIT TOO LONG.

31:02.661 --> 31:06.332
AT THIS RATE, WHO KNOWS
HOW LONG I'LL BE AROUND?

31:17.009 --> 31:19.678
- JUSTIN!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

31:19.711 --> 31:21.914
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW WORRIED I WAS?

31:21.948 --> 31:23.983
HOW COULD YOU JUST LEAVE
LIKE THAT?

31:24.016 --> 31:25.985
- I LEFT YOU A NOTE.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.319
- COME INSIDE.

31:40.332 --> 31:41.600
- OKAY, COME ON, COME ON.
BE QUIET.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.402
- HOW ABOUT ONE MORE
FOR THE ROAD?

31:43.435 --> 31:44.436
SIX IS MY LUCKY NUMBER.

31:44.470 --> 31:47.273
- OH, SUPER. OKAY.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.408
I LEFT YOU MY NUMBER
BY THE BED.

31:49.441 --> 31:50.977
YOU SURE
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING?

31:51.010 --> 31:52.411
OKAY, SCRAM.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.180
OW. OW! SHHH.
- CALL ME.

31:54.213 --> 31:55.181
AH-H-AH.

32:03.455 --> 32:04.590
- SO, UM...

32:04.623 --> 32:08.560
HOW WAS YOUR PIECE OF CAKE?

32:11.597 --> 32:13.365
- MOM. MOM, PLEASE.
[crying over telephone]

32:13.399 --> 32:14.366
MOM, WOULD YOU
PLEASE STOP CRYING?

32:14.400 --> 32:15.167
- DID SHE PUT YOU UP TO IT?

32:15.201 --> 32:17.069
- NO, SHE DID NOT
PUT ME UP TO IT.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.604
- THAT'S RIGHT,
BLAME THE JEW.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.040
- DAMN IT, MOTHER,
IF LYNNETTE CAN GET MARRIED

32:21.073 --> 32:23.142
THREE TIMES,
THEN WHY THE HELL CAN'T I?

32:23.175 --> 32:24.710
WELL, FRANKLY, I DON'T GIVE
A SHIT WHAT PEOPLE THINK.

32:24.743 --> 32:27.246
- TWO WOMEN DO NOT GET MARRIED.
- LOVE TO DADDY.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.714
- HOW CAN WE SHOW OUR FACES?
WHAT ARE--

32:28.747 --> 32:30.316
- CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE VIDEO.

32:30.349 --> 32:31.450
- DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY WEDDINGS

32:31.483 --> 32:33.319
WE'RE COMMITTED TO THIS SEASON
AND ANNIVERSARY PARTIES?

32:33.352 --> 32:35.054
- BITCH!

32:35.087 --> 32:36.388
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE THIS UPSET.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.456
- THEY ARE NOT.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.625
IN TIME, THEY'LL SWEEP IT
UNDER THEIR WASPY RUG,

32:39.658 --> 32:40.726
AND FORGET ALL ABOUT IT.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.428
- I DON'T WANT
TO FORGET ABOUT IT.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.196
I WANT FULL
AND EQUAL RECOGNITION,

32:44.230 --> 32:46.398
IF NOT UNDER THE LAW, THEN AT
LEAST IN MY OWN PARENTS' HOUSE.

32:46.432 --> 32:50.069
- I'D COUNT ON GETTING HITCHED
IN MISSISSIPPI FIRST.

32:53.039 --> 32:55.241
- CAN'T WE STAY IN BED
A LITTLE LONGER?

32:55.274 --> 32:58.710
- OH.

32:58.744 --> 33:02.181
- MWAH.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.716
- YOU STILL HAVEN'T ANSWERED
MY QUESTION.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.218
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

33:06.252 --> 33:09.055
- YOU WEREN'T SERIOUS?

33:09.088 --> 33:11.257
- I WAS DEAD SERIOUS.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.591
WHY DO THEY GET TO RECEIVE

33:12.624 --> 33:14.226
EVERYONE'S BLESSINGS
AND PRESENTS AND WE DON'T?

33:14.260 --> 33:18.230
- I KNEW IT HAD TO DO
WITH PRESENTS.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.266
LOOK, WE CAN'T GET MARRIED.

33:20.299 --> 33:23.502
I MEAN, FOR ONE THING
IT'S NOT LEGAL, ONLY SYMBOLIC,

33:23.535 --> 33:25.771
AND FOR ANOTHER, YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT WEDDINGS.

33:25.804 --> 33:27.539
THEY'RE ANTIQUATED...

33:27.573 --> 33:30.109
both: MEANINGLESS RITUALS
FOR HETEROSEXUALS.

33:30.142 --> 33:35.081
- I'VE HEARD.
- LINZ, WE HAVE A MARRIAGE...

33:35.114 --> 33:37.316
AND A FAMILY...

33:37.349 --> 33:39.618
SIX YEARS STRONG,

33:39.651 --> 33:43.422
GIVE OR TAKE A FEW BUMPS
IN THE ROAD.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.057
AND AS NICE AS IT WOULD BE

33:45.091 --> 33:48.094
TO HAVE A PARTY
AND PAYBACK, FINALLY,

33:48.127 --> 33:49.661
FOR ALL THE WEDDING GIFTS
WE'VE SHELLED OUT

33:49.695 --> 33:51.430
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS,

33:51.463 --> 33:52.698
WE DON'T NEED ANY
OF THAT TO PROVE

33:52.731 --> 33:54.300
TO OURSELVES WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.168
NOW COME ON.
[claps]

33:56.202 --> 33:59.171
LET'S GO AND GRAB OUR KID
AND GET SOME BRUNCH.

34:09.481 --> 34:10.816
- I MEAN, IF I'D KNOWN
HOW MANY MEN

34:10.849 --> 34:12.284
YOU COULD MEET
AT STRAIGHT FUNCTIONS,

34:12.318 --> 34:14.420
I'D HAVE STARTED
GOING YEARS AGO.

34:14.453 --> 34:17.089
- LEAVE IT TO YOU TO SNIFF OUT
THE ONE TRUFFLE IN THE GARDEN.

34:17.123 --> 34:18.690
- MM, I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.859
I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS
ABOUT THE GROOM.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.728
- [laughs]
OH, YOU MEAN LINDSAY'S SISTER

34:22.761 --> 34:24.463
MIGHT ACTUALLY BREAK
HER OWN RECORD?

34:24.496 --> 34:26.465
[laughter]

34:27.499 --> 34:30.136
- HOW ABOUT YOU, MICHAEL?

34:30.169 --> 34:31.570
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT
ON THE TOWN?

34:31.603 --> 34:32.571
- MM.

34:32.604 --> 34:36.342
HE BROUGHT HOME A NICE
CENTERPIECE OF HIS OWN.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.444
- JEEZ, EM.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.782
- WELL,

34:43.815 --> 34:46.318
YOU CERTAINLY DIDN'T WASTE
ANY TIME, DID YOU?

34:46.352 --> 34:48.787
IN TOWN LESS
THAN 24 HOURS AND--

34:48.820 --> 34:50.856
- WHY SHOULDN'T
HE GET A LITTLE ACTION?

34:50.889 --> 34:52.591
HE'S OUTSIDE
THE REQUIRED 400-MILE LIMIT

34:52.624 --> 34:55.694
FOR EXTRAMARITAL QUICKIES
AND ANONYMOUS ASSIGNATIONS.

34:55.727 --> 34:58.530
MIND YOU, IF YOU WANT
TO DO ANYTHING FURTHER,

34:58.564 --> 35:02.368
YOU'LL NEED OVERSEAS TRAVEL
AND A MINIMUM 14-DAY STAY.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.435
- I JUST THOUGHT,
WITH EVERYTHING YOU WROTE,

35:03.469 --> 35:04.736
THAT, YOU KNOW,

35:04.770 --> 35:07.139
YOU AND DAVID WERE
SO IN LOVE, SO COMMITTED.

35:07.173 --> 35:09.741
- EVERY RELATIONSHIP HAS
ITS OWN SET OF RULES.

35:09.775 --> 35:14.180
THEIR ARRANGEMENT
IS NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.

35:14.213 --> 35:17.416
RIGHT, SWEETIE?

35:17.449 --> 35:21.353
NOW WHO WANTS A POT STICKER?

35:21.387 --> 35:25.157
- WE BROKE UP.

35:25.191 --> 35:27.693
- WHAT?

35:27.726 --> 35:29.328
- IT'S OVER.

35:29.361 --> 35:32.298
DAVID AND I ARE OVER.

35:43.509 --> 35:44.676
- MMM, GOD.

35:44.710 --> 35:45.877
YOU KNOW,
THESE ARE THE BEST

35:45.911 --> 35:47.179
PAN-FRIED DUMPLINGS
I'VE EVER HAD.

35:47.213 --> 35:48.547
- DID YOU HEAR
WHAT HE JUST SAID?

35:48.580 --> 35:51.450
- HE BROKE UP.

35:51.483 --> 35:54.220
YOU BROKE UP.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.388
SO WHY THE FUCK
DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

35:56.422 --> 35:57.889
- I WAS GOING TO.
- WHEN?

35:57.923 --> 36:00.359
AFTER YOU'D CONVINCED US
THAT YOU'D FOUND PARADISE LOST?

36:00.392 --> 36:02.661
- WHEN THE TIME WAS RIGHT.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.530
- [scoffs]

36:04.563 --> 36:06.232
- YOU KNOW, BUT THERE'S
NEVER A RIGHT TIME

36:06.265 --> 36:08.700
TO ADMIT THAT YOU'VE FAILED.

36:08.734 --> 36:11.270
YOU HAD THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY
TO START YOUR LIFE OVER

36:11.303 --> 36:12.371
WITH SOMEONE
THAT YOU LOVED

36:12.404 --> 36:14.540
OR THOUGHT YOU LOVED,

36:14.573 --> 36:17.843
AND YOU BLEW IT.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.450
I BLEW IT.

36:24.483 --> 36:25.984
I COMPLAINED THAT
DAVID WAS WORKING TOO MUCH,

36:26.017 --> 36:27.953
AND THAT I COULDN'T FIND
A JOB,

36:27.986 --> 36:29.788
AND THAT I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS,

36:29.821 --> 36:32.891
AND WHEN I ACCUSED HIM OF BEING
THOUGHTLESS AND NOT CARING

36:32.924 --> 36:35.627
AND SAID THAT IF I'D KNOWN
IT WAS GONNA BE LIKE THIS,

36:35.661 --> 36:37.963
I NEVER WOULD HAVE COME,
HE SAID,

36:37.996 --> 36:41.567
"WELL, GO HOME, MICHAEL.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.670
GO HOME."

36:50.008 --> 36:52.944
- WELL...

36:55.981 --> 37:00.018
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT
YOU FAILED.

37:00.051 --> 37:03.322
- AND YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT TRUE

37:03.355 --> 37:05.591
THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY FRIENDS,

37:05.624 --> 37:09.328
'CAUSE YOU STILL GOT US.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.463
- AND AS FOR COMING HOME,

37:11.497 --> 37:15.734
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S NO SHAME IN THAT.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.970
IT'S WHAT IT'S HERE FOR.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.610
- THE FACT THAT
CHRISTOPHER HOBBS PLED GUILTY

37:24.643 --> 37:27.813
TO ASSAULT CHARGES FOR HIS
VICIOUS ATTACK ON JUSTIN TAYLOR

37:27.846 --> 37:30.682
IN NO WAY MITIGATES
THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CRIME,

37:30.716 --> 37:34.052
OR THE TRAGIC EFFECTS
ON THESE YOUNG MEN'S LIVES.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.855
BOTH WERE HONOR STUDENTS
AT ST. JAMES ACADEMY.

37:36.888 --> 37:39.691
BOTH HAD PLANNED
TO ATTEND COLLEGE.

37:39.725 --> 37:43.362
NOW ONE YOUNG MAN IS RECOVERING
FROM SERIOUS BRAIN INJURIES,

37:43.395 --> 37:46.298
AND THE OTHER IS FACING
A PRISON SENTENCE.

37:46.332 --> 37:48.767
I ASK MYSELF
HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED?

37:48.800 --> 37:50.769
- I'LL TELL YOU HOW.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.671
CHRIS HOBBS
IS A HOMOPHOBIC ANIMAL...

37:52.704 --> 37:55.641
- SHH.
- WHO SHOULD BE PUT AWAY.

37:55.674 --> 37:58.377
- I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW
PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING

37:58.410 --> 37:59.611
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
FOR A YOUNG MAN

37:59.645 --> 38:02.448
OF CHRIS HOBBS'S FINE,
MORAL UPBRINGING,

38:02.481 --> 38:05.617
TO BE APPROACHED SEXUALLY
BY A FELLOW STUDENT,

38:05.651 --> 38:07.853
THEN TO SEE HIM FLAUNT
HIS LIFESTYLE

38:07.886 --> 38:11.089
BY BRINGING HIS MALE LOVER
TO THE PROM AND ENGAGE IN

38:11.122 --> 38:15.060
WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS
A HIGHLY PROVOCATIVE DANCE.

38:15.093 --> 38:17.529
GIVEN THE FACT
THAT HE WAS DRINKING,

38:17.563 --> 38:19.365
WHICH HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN,

38:19.398 --> 38:20.666
I COULD UNDERSTAND
HOW CHRIS HOBBS

38:20.699 --> 38:23.068
MIGHT LOSE CONTROL
OF HIS BETTER JUDGMENT.

38:23.101 --> 38:27.739
STILL, IT DOES NOT EXCUSE
HIS ACTIONS.

38:27.773 --> 38:30.409
AND SO I HAVE STRUGGLED

38:30.442 --> 38:32.411
TO FIND
THE APPROPRIATE SENTENCE

38:32.444 --> 38:35.013
TO IMPOSE FOR
THIS UNFORTUNATE CRIME.

38:35.046 --> 38:37.949
COURT WILL RECESS
FOR 10 MINUTES.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.785
- WHERE THE FUCK'S HE GOING?

38:39.818 --> 38:41.553
- IT'S A HELL
OF A TIME TO LEAVE.

38:41.587 --> 38:42.754
- GREAT SUSPENSE.

38:42.788 --> 38:45.691
- IT'S HOW HE GOT HIS NAME,
REGULAR ROY.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.793
EVERY DAY AT 12:15 ON THE DOT

38:47.826 --> 38:49.561
HE GOES TO THE BATHROOM ACROSS
THE HALL,

38:49.595 --> 38:50.896
SITS IN THE STALL
UNDER THE WINDOW,

38:50.929 --> 38:53.064
TAKES A DUMP AND HAS A SMOKE.

38:53.098 --> 38:56.668
- [groans]

38:56.702 --> 38:59.971
- NO WAY!
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

39:00.005 --> 39:03.008
- WOULDN'T MATTER
WHO HE WAS SENTENCING.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.086
- CHRISTOPHER MARK HOBBS,

39:15.120 --> 39:18.957
THIS COURT ACCEPTS YOUR PLEA
OF GUILTY FOR SIMPLE ASSAULT.

39:18.990 --> 39:19.925
BECAUSE OF YOUR AGE,

39:19.958 --> 39:21.860
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE
NO PREVIOUS OFFENSES

39:21.893 --> 39:23.762
AND BECAUSE
YOU WERE UNDULY PROVOKED,

39:23.795 --> 39:26.665
YOU ARE HEREBY GIVEN
A TWO-YEAR SUSPENDED SENTENCE

39:26.698 --> 39:29.868
AND ORDERED TO SERVE 500 HOURS
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.069
[gavel bangs]
- WHAT?

39:31.102 --> 39:33.639
- UNBELIEVABLE!
- NO. NO.

39:33.672 --> 39:36.675
- CAN HE DO THAT?
- OF COURSE HE CAN DO THAT.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.144
- NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
- WHAT?

39:39.177 --> 39:41.447
- WAIT A MINUTE.
- NICE SLAP ON THE WRIST, JUDGE.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.948
- WAIT A MINUTE.
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.450
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

39:44.483 --> 39:45.584
- CAN YOU TELL US
HOW YOU FEEL--

39:45.617 --> 39:47.152
- LOOK AT HIM.

39:47.185 --> 39:50.722
HE'S PRACTICALLY
A FUCKING MURDERER.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.524
HOW'D HE GET OFF SCOT-FREE?

39:52.558 --> 39:53.925
- MADE A DEAL.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.861
HIS LAWYER AGREED
TO PLEAD GUILTY.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.796
THE PROSECUTOR REDUCED
THE CHARGES

39:57.829 --> 39:59.164
FROM AGGRAVATED
TO SIMPLE ASSAULT,

39:59.197 --> 40:01.900
AND ROY SENT HIM OFF
WITH PROBATION AND SERVICE.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.769
- YEAH, WELL I'D LIKE TO GIVE
HIM SOMETHING TO SERVICE.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.605
- HE'D HAVE GOTTEN MORE FOR
BASHING A DOG.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.206
- IT'S OKAY, MA.
LET'S GO HOME.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.909
GET SOME REST.
- DAMN RIGHT I'M GOING HOME.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.478
BUT NOT TO REST.

40:12.511 --> 40:15.481
I'M GOING TO CALL EVERY P-FLAG
CHAPTER IN THIS COUNTRY.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.182
I'M NOT PUTTING UP
WITH THIS.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.917
NOT FOR ONE FUCKING SECOND.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.886
WE'RE GOING TO MARCH.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.053
WE'RE GOING TO CARRY HUGE SIGNS

40:22.087 --> 40:25.190
THAT LET THIS ASSHOLE JUDGE
KNOW WHAT WE THINK OF HIM.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.458
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
- AND WE'RE GOING TO MARCH

40:26.492 --> 40:28.193
ON WASHINGTON IF WE HAVE TO.

40:28.226 --> 40:29.661
- NO, SIS.
- DO YOU HEAR THAT!

40:29.695 --> 40:30.662
- JUST--NOW SETTLE DOWN.

40:30.696 --> 40:32.197
- WE'RE GOING TO WASHINGTON.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.633
- SETTLE DOWN.
COME ON, SIS. THAT'S ENOUGH.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.603
- [sobbing]
- IT'S OKAY, MA. IT'S OKAY.

40:37.636 --> 40:42.608
IT'S OKAY. HE'S NOT GOING
TO GET AWAY WITH THIS.

40:42.641 --> 40:45.777
WE'LL MARCH.
WE'LL PROTEST.

40:45.811 --> 40:49.014
- BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.816
ALL PROTESTS ARE BULLSHIT.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.184
I MEAN, A BUNCH
OF WELL-MEANING DO-GOODERS

40:53.218 --> 40:54.886
MARCHING AROUND CARRYING SIGNS,

40:54.920 --> 40:57.589
CHANTING?

40:57.623 --> 40:59.925
"HEY, HEY, HO, HO,
HOMOPHOBIA'S GOT TO GO."

40:59.958 --> 41:01.760
GIVE ME
A GODDAMN FUCKING BREAK.

41:01.793 --> 41:02.861
- SO, I GUESS THIS MEANS

41:02.894 --> 41:04.830
YOU'RE NOT GOING WITH US?

41:04.863 --> 41:06.898
- [chants]
HELL NO, I WON'T GO.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.700
- SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SIT
THERE ON YOUR ASS

41:08.734 --> 41:10.936
AND DO NOTHING.
- YEAH. I GUESS SO.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.704
JESUS, WHAT THE FUCK
DID I DO ALL THESE WEEKS

41:12.738 --> 41:14.105
WITHOUT YOU HERE
TO HARANGUE ME?

41:14.139 --> 41:17.075
WHEN THE FUCK
ARE YOU GOING BACK ANYWAY?

41:24.983 --> 41:26.718
- I'M NOT.

41:26.752 --> 41:29.220
- I KNOW.

41:29.254 --> 41:30.889
- WHY?
DID TED AND EMMETT TELL YOU?

41:30.922 --> 41:35.994
- NO, I MANAGED TO FIGURE IT
OUT ALL BY MY LITTLE SELF.

41:36.027 --> 41:38.997
I MEAN...

41:39.030 --> 41:41.867
I KNEW IT WOULDN'T WORK OUT.

41:41.900 --> 41:45.136
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
RIGHT AS USUAL.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.005
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME, ASSHOLE.
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.207
I MEAN, DID YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'D BE HAPPY IN WISCONSIN,

41:49.240 --> 41:50.809
PLAYING THE DOCTOR'S WIFE?

41:50.842 --> 41:52.711
- OREGON.
PORTLAND'S IN OREGON.

41:52.744 --> 41:55.681
- WHEREVER THE FUCK.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.249
- WELL, MAYBE
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

41:58.283 --> 42:01.519
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE FUCK
I BELONG.

42:16.768 --> 42:18.203
- THERE.
THAT'S WHERE.

42:18.236 --> 42:19.838
NOW...

42:19.871 --> 42:23.308
WILL YOU GO ON
AND HELP YOUR MOM?

42:23.341 --> 42:29.247
AND MAKE THE WORLD SAFE
FOR FAGS.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.883
- WHAT IS THIS?
IS THIS OUR OLD CHEMISTRY BOOK?

42:31.917 --> 42:35.621
YEAH, IT IS, FROM HIGH SCHOOL.
- YEAH, THAT'S, UM...

42:35.654 --> 42:36.521
I'M DOING SOME RESEARCH.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.791
I HAVE A NEW CLIENT
AT A DRUG COMPANY.

42:39.825 --> 42:41.993
- OH. WELL,
YOU MUST BE THRILLED.

42:42.027 --> 42:45.597
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET "E"
WHOLESALE.

43:04.149 --> 43:05.283
- [groaning]

43:05.316 --> 43:08.219
[chuckles]

43:41.687 --> 43:44.856
- AFTER SPENDING 14 HOURS GLUED
TO A TOILET SEAT,

43:44.890 --> 43:47.793
THE JUDGE WAS UNHARMED
BUT BADLY SHAKEN.

43:47.826 --> 43:48.694
[laughter]

43:48.727 --> 43:50.996
SO FAR THERE ARE NO CLUES
OR SUSPECTS.

43:51.029 --> 43:53.732
- THE SEAT OF JUSTICE HAS
BEEN SEVERELY COMPROMISED.

43:53.765 --> 43:55.400
- NO SKIN OFF MY ASS.

43:55.433 --> 43:57.335
- BET HE WISHES HE COULD SAY
THE SAME THING.

43:57.368 --> 43:58.670
[laughter]

43:58.704 --> 44:00.138
- WELL,
WHO DO YOU THINK DID IT?

44:00.171 --> 44:02.340
- SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T LIKE
WAITING FOR HIS SENTENCE.

44:02.373 --> 44:04.275
ONE THING YOU CAN SAY
FOR SURE,

44:04.309 --> 44:06.377
THAT MUST HAVE SCARED
THE SHIT OUT OF HIM.

44:06.411 --> 44:08.880
- EW.
[laughter]

44:08.914 --> 44:12.150
- KNOW WHAT
THIS REMINDS ME OF?

44:12.183 --> 44:14.085
THAT TIME IN CHEMISTRY CLASS

44:14.119 --> 44:16.688
WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING
TO INVENT SYNTHETIC CUM,

44:16.722 --> 44:17.956
AND YOU MADE THAT GOO.

44:17.989 --> 44:20.759
YOU PUT IT ALL OVER THE TOILET
SEAT IN THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE,

44:20.792 --> 44:26.331
AND MRS. RENFREW GOT GLUED
TO IT.

44:27.966 --> 44:30.936
- I BETTER TAKE OFF.

44:35.874 --> 44:38.744
- I KNEW THEY'D LET HIM GO.
[clears throat]

44:38.777 --> 44:41.446
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US.
THEY WANT US ALL DEAD.

44:41.479 --> 44:43.915
LOOK. DON'T THINK ABOUT IT,
OKAY?

44:43.949 --> 44:45.416
JUST FOCUS ON
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

44:45.450 --> 44:48.086
- SHIT.

44:48.119 --> 44:50.922
FUCK!

44:50.956 --> 44:53.324
- COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT.

44:53.358 --> 44:55.293
- NAH, I CAN'T.

44:55.326 --> 44:58.263
- YES, YOU CAN. COME ON.

45:00.866 --> 45:02.934
- HEY, THAT ONE WAS GOOD,
JUSTIN.

45:02.968 --> 45:06.471
- OH, DAPH,
YOU'RE SO FULL OF SHIT.

45:09.374 --> 45:10.809
- HI, HONEY.

45:10.842 --> 45:12.277
HELLO, DAPHNE.
- HEY.

45:12.310 --> 45:13.979
- HELLO, MRS. TAYLOR.

45:14.012 --> 45:15.413
- HELLO, BRIAN.

45:15.446 --> 45:18.016
- WE WERE JUST TOSSING
THE BALL.

45:18.049 --> 45:19.918
- I THINK
YOU SHOULD REST NOW.

45:19.951 --> 45:21.486
- I'M NOT TIRED.

45:21.519 --> 45:24.455
- I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO BRIAN.

45:29.194 --> 45:30.996
- COME ON, DAPH.

45:34.565 --> 45:37.268
- HEY,
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER BALL?

45:47.078 --> 45:48.847
- THE DAY THE DOCTOR SENT HIM
HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL,

45:48.880 --> 45:51.783
HE SAID HE'D NEVER SEEN SUCH
A DETERMINED PATIENT,

45:51.817 --> 45:56.254
AND HE ASKED ME WHAT IT WAS
THAT MADE HIM WORK SO HARD.

45:56.287 --> 45:59.390
I KNEW,
BUT I DIDN'T TELL HIM.

45:59.424 --> 46:01.793
IT WAS YOU.

46:01.827 --> 46:03.862
EVERY DAY THAT
YOU DIDN'T COME TO SEE HIM

46:03.895 --> 46:06.965
WAS MORE INCENTIVE FOR HIM
TO GET BETTER

46:06.998 --> 46:11.436
AND GET OUT SO
THAT HE COULD COME TO SEE YOU.

46:11.469 --> 46:13.404
OF COURSE
WHAT JUSTIN DIDN'T KNOW,

46:13.438 --> 46:15.406
AND I DIDN'T TELL HIM,

46:15.440 --> 46:20.311
WAS THAT YOU WERE THERE,
EVERY NIGHT.

46:20.345 --> 46:23.949
THE NURSE ON DUTY TOLD ME.

46:23.982 --> 46:26.284
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT,

46:26.317 --> 46:29.154
BUT HE'S HOME NOW,
SAFE AND SOUND,

46:29.187 --> 46:30.956
AND THERE ISN'T ANY REASON
ANYMORE

46:30.989 --> 46:36.127
FOR YOU TO WATCH OVER HIM,
SO...

46:36.161 --> 46:38.163
SO I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO LEAVE

46:38.196 --> 46:41.132
AND NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

46:44.135 --> 46:45.837
- I CARE ABOUT HIM.

46:45.871 --> 46:51.109
- IT WAS BECAUSE OF YOU
HE WAS ALMOST KILLED.

46:51.142 --> 46:55.146
FORGIVE ME FOR BEING
SO BLUNT.

46:55.180 --> 46:58.183
I'VE TRIED TO ACCEPT HIM
FOR WHO HE IS,

46:58.216 --> 47:01.953
TO ACCEPT YOUR WORLD,
AND THAT HE'S PART OF IT.

47:01.987 --> 47:04.589
I'VE EVEN TRIED
TO ACCEPT YOU.

47:04.622 --> 47:07.625
AND AS A RESULT,
I NEARLY LOST HIM.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.460
AND I DON'T INTEND
TO LOSE HIM AGAIN.

47:09.494 --> 47:14.365
SO IF YOU CARE ABOUT HIM,

47:14.399 --> 47:18.303
AND I BELIEVE YOU--
I BELIEVE YOU DO...

47:19.971 --> 47:22.107
YOU'LL DO WHAT I ASK,

47:22.140 --> 47:26.344
AND RETURN MY SON TO ME.

47:41.459 --> 47:45.196
- [background chatter]

47:47.465 --> 47:51.903
[indistinct chatter]

47:51.937 --> 47:54.639
- CATCH.
[laughter]

47:54.672 --> 47:55.640
- NICE CATCH.

47:55.673 --> 47:59.044
- ANOTHER ONE.

48:07.018 --> 48:09.587
[engine turns]

48:21.166 --> 48:23.935
- [laughs]

48:26.437 --> 48:28.406
[Count on No One]

48:28.439 --> 48:33.378
- * I USED TO TRUST

48:36.214 --> 48:41.219
* BUT THAT'S SO FAR BEHIND

48:44.055 --> 48:49.294
* KEEPS MY MIND CHANGING

48:49.327 --> 48:53.064
* FOREVER

49:00.705 --> 49:05.376
* I'M ALL ALONE

49:08.713 --> 49:13.051
* CUT LOOSE AND DRIFTING

49:14.119 --> 49:17.322
* SIFTING

49:17.355 --> 49:20.691
* THROUGH THE WRECKAGE

49:20.725 --> 49:24.662
* I COUNT ON NO ONE

49:24.695 --> 49:32.470
*

49:32.503 --> 49:38.076
* WHAT WILL I EVER DO

49:40.511 --> 49:46.251
* WITH ALL MY ANGER?

49:48.286 --> 49:53.291
* I'M EATEN UP ALIVE

49:53.324 --> 49:57.495
* FROM DEEP INSIDE

49:57.528 --> 50:00.465
* OF ME

50:12.377 --> 50:18.316
* I USED TO TRUST

50:19.550 --> 50:24.322
* BUT THAT'S SO FAR BEHIND
