CHRIS ROCK:
After two years at Corleone,

00:03.371 --> 00:05.506
I'd gotten used to being
the only black kid.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.675
But it had two major
down sides.

00:07.708 --> 00:11.045
One down side was,
I was the only black kid.

00:11.079 --> 00:13.514
And the other was,
I was the only black kid.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.683
Let's celebrate
the day Chris's people

00:15.716 --> 00:19.187
finally realized
they were emancipated.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.055
Happy Juneteenth,
Chris.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.159
I thought that things
would never change.

00:28.162 --> 00:31.632
Then Albert arrived.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.604
I was excited
about Albert's arrival

00:36.637 --> 00:38.672
and anxious for us to meet.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.674
But I decided to play it cool.

00:40.708 --> 00:41.842
What's up?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.544
What's up?

00:45.579 --> 00:47.815
All right.

00:47.848 --> 00:51.051
I was cool on the outside
but inside I felt like this...

01:09.270 --> 01:11.839
Cool or not,
we were two of a kind.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.283
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:37.498 --> 01:41.502

PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:45.173 --> 01:46.774
The only one
who wasn't looking forward

01:46.807 --> 01:49.777
to Albert being
at Corleone was Greg.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.912
I'm going to go talk
to the new kid.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.514
I've been dreading
this day.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.516
What are you talking
about?

01:55.549 --> 01:57.518
I always knew
that someday

01:57.551 --> 01:59.253
someone would come
along that had more

01:59.287 --> 02:01.322
in common with you.

02:01.355 --> 02:03.191
Just 'cause he's black?

02:03.224 --> 02:04.325
Greg, that's silly.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.493
Not that silly.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.528
I'll be back.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.564
Sure you will.

02:10.598 --> 02:13.401
Hey, welcome
to Corleone.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.568
Hi, I'm Albert.

02:14.602 --> 02:15.603
Hey, Chris.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.605
Man, I was glad
to see you.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.240
When I first got here,

02:19.273 --> 02:21.309
I thought it was going
to be like my last school,

02:21.342 --> 02:22.510
where I was the only
black kid.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.444
Mm-hmm.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.213
They really gave me
a hard time over there.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.914
I got beat up
almost every day.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.282
Same here.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.317
What school did
you go to?

02:29.350 --> 02:30.584
Strom Thurmond
Junior High.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.220
The only black kids allowed
there

02:32.253 --> 02:33.954
were children
of Strom Thurmond.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.689
Well, now there's
two of us,

02:35.723 --> 02:37.225
which is twice as much
as there was before.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.692
So, we can have each
other's back.

02:38.726 --> 02:40.228
That sounds like a plan.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.630
Oh, I got to go,

02:42.663 --> 02:43.864
but we can hang
out later.

02:43.897 --> 02:44.832
Cool.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.971
I told you I'd be back.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.307
Yeah, but for how long, Chris?

02:53.341 --> 02:55.309
For how long?

02:55.343 --> 02:59.347
That concludes another episode
of "As The Nerd Turns."

03:00.681 --> 03:03.551
Class, we have a new student
with us.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.219
Say hello to Albert!

03:05.253 --> 03:07.288
ALL:
Hi, Albert.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.756
Chris, you must
be so happy.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.258
You must feel just
like Jackie Robinson

03:10.291 --> 03:11.692
when Larry Doby
arrived.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.228
More like Robert Perish
when Dennis Johnson showed up.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.396
Who's Larry Doby?

03:15.429 --> 03:18.399
He was the second black
man in baseball,

03:18.432 --> 03:21.569
but he was taller than
Jackie and more...

03:21.602 --> 03:23.337
strapping.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.005
With his strong
shoulders

03:25.038 --> 03:27.275
and Nubian profile.

03:27.308 --> 03:30.678
His Cleveland Indians
uniform complimented

03:30.711 --> 03:33.013
by the rich caramel
color of his skin.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.983
And the way he
swung his bat.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.019
Forget jungle fever.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.854
She's having a jungle seizure.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.490
Ms. Morello, are you okay?

03:42.523 --> 03:44.492
Uh, yes.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.328
Anyway...

03:47.361 --> 03:50.030
after years of being alone
and ostracized,

03:50.063 --> 03:53.534
you now have a soul brother.

03:53.567 --> 03:57.004
Somebody to talk jive with
and to shoot dice with,

03:57.037 --> 03:59.540
to talk about being raised
by MaDear with.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.909
Just seeing the two of you

04:01.942 --> 04:04.878
together would make your leaders
like Dr. King

04:04.912 --> 04:06.880
and Uncle Remus proud.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.050
Oh, happy day!

04:11.985 --> 04:14.054
She might have been crazy,
but she was right.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.291
I finally had somebody
I could really relate to.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.530
Y'all, go put that stuff
in the kitchen.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.532
Bills, bills...

04:24.565 --> 04:27.568
more bills, junk mail.

04:28.569 --> 04:31.572
Internal Revenue Service?

04:32.706 --> 04:35.343
"We are pleased to inform you"

04:35.376 --> 04:37.511
"estimated tax..."

04:37.545 --> 04:39.513
Refund?

04:40.881 --> 04:44.017
Oh, my God.

04:44.051 --> 04:47.355
A tax refund check is
like a bonus for broke people.

04:47.388 --> 04:50.524
A bonus which my mother
accepted with grace and class.

04:50.558 --> 04:53.394
Kiss my ass, Visa!

04:53.427 --> 04:55.363
Visa was actually the name
of the lady

04:55.396 --> 04:57.698
who collected bills
for MasterCard.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.533
This is way too much!

04:59.567 --> 05:00.701
What's way too much?

05:00.734 --> 05:02.336
Our refund, it's,

05:02.370 --> 05:04.004
it's three times more
than what we were expecting.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.939
That's how MC Hammer got
in trouble.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.608
Cool, now we can finally
buy stuff

05:07.641 --> 05:09.076
without having to put it
on layaway.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.478
You got that
right.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.480
Hey, don't take
your coats off.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.348
Why, where are
we going?

05:14.382 --> 05:15.115
Shopping!

05:15.148 --> 05:16.517
We're going shopping!

05:18.452 --> 05:19.753
The more time I spent
with Albert,

05:19.787 --> 05:22.022
the more I found out
we had a lot in common.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.457
Did you see
227 this week?

05:23.491 --> 05:25.058
Aw, man,
how funny was that?

05:25.092 --> 05:26.560
When Sandra pretended
to be Mary?

05:26.594 --> 05:28.462
Then Lester comes home
and cold busts her?

05:28.496 --> 05:30.464
Man, I love
that show!
Me, too!

05:30.498 --> 05:32.933
Back then there were almost
no black shows on TV.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.435
Kind of like it is now.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.003
Anybody see
Kate & Allie?

05:36.036 --> 05:37.137
No!

05:37.170 --> 05:38.506
No.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.107
Well, Kate convinced Allie
to accompany her

05:40.140 --> 05:41.642
to their 20th high school

05:41.675 --> 05:43.110
reunion where
Allie found herself

05:43.143 --> 05:46.113
questioning her life's successes
and failures.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.115
It could have been worse...

05:48.148 --> 05:50.818
Greg never missed an episode
of Murder She Wrote.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.121
Anyone who says money
can't buy happiness

05:54.154 --> 05:57.357
never saw my mother
with her IRS refund couch.

06:00.461 --> 06:03.163
Ooh, this is nice.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.834
The tighter I got with Albert,
the more uptight Greg got.

06:06.867 --> 06:07.868
Hey, Chris.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.670
Do you want to come over
and play some video games?

06:09.703 --> 06:11.104
Nah, we're gonna go
hang out.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.473
You want to come?

06:12.506 --> 06:13.273
Where are you going?

06:13.306 --> 06:14.274
We're going to the
record store.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.109
The twelve inch of
"The Show" just came out.

06:16.143 --> 06:16.910
What show?

06:16.944 --> 06:18.178
Doug E. Fresh.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.413
Dougie who?

06:19.447 --> 06:20.481
You know, Slick Rick...

06:20.514 --> 06:21.882
:
La-di-da-di...

06:21.915 --> 06:23.751
BOTH:
We like to party.
We don't cause trouble.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.385
We don't bother nobody.

06:27.655 --> 06:31.124
Chris, I don't think
your man likes rap.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.159
Yeah, he does.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.594
Come on, Greg.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.095
No, that's okay.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.564
You guys can go ahead.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.330
You sure?

06:37.364 --> 06:39.032
Yeah, I got lots
of homework to do.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.868
All right,
I'll call you later.

06:40.901 --> 06:45.038
While Greg had a negative
reaction to the brothers...

06:45.072 --> 06:47.575
my mother was hoping
for a positive reaction

06:47.608 --> 06:49.443
from my father.

06:49.477 --> 06:50.711
We can't afford this.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.779
Yes, we can.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.614
I-I used our tax refund check.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.115
Wait. When did that come?

06:55.148 --> 06:56.617
The other day.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.953
Look, Rochelle,
I had plans for that money,

06:59.987 --> 07:02.656
that didn't include spending it
all on a couch.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.658
But, baby,
we got triple the amount

07:04.692 --> 07:06.193
that we were supposed to get.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.795
Triple?
Yes!

07:07.828 --> 07:10.464
But we were only supposed
to get back $600.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.965
I know, I know, and that's why

07:11.999 --> 07:13.834
I bought a little bit of
something for everybody.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.536
I paid some bills for you,

07:15.569 --> 07:16.637
and I bought the couch for me,

07:16.670 --> 07:19.540
and I bought some variety cereal
packs for the kids.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.207
Wow, cereal.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.242
Careful, you'll spoil us.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.545
Hey, wait, wait, wait,
where are you going?

07:24.578 --> 07:26.179
I'm going to go sit down.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.515
No you're not.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.517
New couch, new rules.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.486
There'll be no eating
on this couch.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.855
So that means no
soups, no salads,

07:34.888 --> 07:36.857
no sandwiches, no ribs,
no Cheerios,

07:36.890 --> 07:39.860
no Bazooka gum, nothing.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.862
If you fall asleep,

07:41.895 --> 07:44.865
keep your funky little feet
on the floor.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.034
Put a towel
underneath your face

07:47.067 --> 07:48.769
to keep the drool
and the dribble

07:48.802 --> 07:50.270
from getting
on my pillows.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.404
If you sit down,

07:51.438 --> 07:55.509
you cannot have any pens,
pencils, markers, nothing.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.845
By the time I sat
on the new couch,

07:57.878 --> 07:59.847
it was the old couch.
Do not...

07:59.880 --> 08:01.515
Hey, Greg, we're going
to go hang out later.

08:01.549 --> 08:02.550
Want to come?

08:02.583 --> 08:05.553
Who's we?

08:05.586 --> 08:06.520
Me and Albert.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.021
Oh, so you're "we" now?

08:08.055 --> 08:09.890
You know, you and
I used to be "we."

08:09.923 --> 08:12.693
Now all of a sudden we
have nothing in common.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.562
What's wrong
with you?

08:14.595 --> 08:15.763
I've been hearing
some pretty bad things

08:15.796 --> 08:17.765
about your new
friend, Albert.
Like what?

08:17.798 --> 08:19.833
People are saying he's not
who he pretends to be.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.168
I mean, he's cool with you,

08:21.201 --> 08:22.703
but he's a jerk
to everyone else.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.037
You know, I think
you're just jealous.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.739
Besides, what do you think
other kids say about me

08:25.773 --> 08:26.940
behind my back?

08:26.974 --> 08:28.609
I think it starts
with the letter N.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.743
And I don't care
what other kids say.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.311
I'm going to hang out
with Albert.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.046
But that doesn't mean you
and me can't still be friends.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.314
Oh, really?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.049
Then why is it that ever
since he's gotten here,

08:36.083 --> 08:37.585
I've seen less and
less of you?

08:37.618 --> 08:38.819
What are you talking about?
We're together now.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.320
Well, this doesn't count.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.189
I mean we don't even eat
lunch together anymore.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.024
You haven't returned
my phone calls.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.560
But hey, things can
change, right?

08:46.594 --> 08:48.028
Is this a show
about my childhood

08:48.061 --> 08:49.597
or an episode of Dr. Phil?

08:49.630 --> 08:51.031
What do you want me
to say?

08:51.064 --> 08:52.165
We have a lot in common.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.333
He gets stuff
that you don't.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.267
Like what?

08:54.301 --> 08:55.636
Sickle-cell anemia.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.638
Like, Albert knows
what it's like

08:57.671 --> 08:59.272
to be the only black kid
in school.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.608
And that's something
you won't get.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.775
You never will.

09:01.809 --> 09:02.843
That's all I'm saying.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.845
Well, all I'm saying is...

09:04.878 --> 09:06.847
watch your back... friend.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.949
How can my life be this much
of a soap opera

09:08.982 --> 09:11.051
with no women involved.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.757
Ms. Morello was right.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.158
Hanging out with Albert
was cool.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.327
But I still felt bad
about fighting with Greg.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.663
There goes
the neighborhood.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.664
Hey,

09:23.697 --> 09:25.899
my dad's got an extra ticket
to the Knicks game.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.167
He said I could
bring somebody.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.335
Want to go?

09:28.368 --> 09:30.003
Are you kidding me?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.605
Heck, yeah, I want to go.

09:31.639 --> 09:32.673
Thanks, man.

09:32.706 --> 09:33.907
No problem.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.175
Hey, let's get out of here

09:35.208 --> 09:37.177
before your man
shows up.
Who, Greg?

09:37.210 --> 09:39.713
Yeah, he's no
fun at all.

09:39.747 --> 09:40.848
Hey, watch this.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.015
Nice shirt.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.051
Did Prince just
have a garage sale?

09:48.255 --> 09:50.257
Hey, Chico and the Man,

09:50.290 --> 09:52.092
Freddie Prinze
just called.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.094
And he wants
his hair back.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.629
Taunt the Puerto Rican kid.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.330
That's a good way to get cut.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.365
Hey, man,
what are you doing?

09:58.398 --> 09:59.833
I'm just having
a little fun.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.234
Try it.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.370
It wasn't natural
for me to act like a jerk,

10:03.403 --> 10:05.105
but I learned quick.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.273
Hey, Caruso.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.709
What, mutt?

10:08.742 --> 10:10.377
You know, you have
a face like a saint.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.278
A Saint Bernard.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.114
One black kid
Caruso could handle.

10:14.147 --> 10:17.651
But two of us was like Will
and Martin in Bad Boys.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.653
Hey, babe.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.655
How come you're not
sitting on the couch?

10:21.689 --> 10:23.657
Did you read this letter
from the IRS?

10:23.691 --> 10:24.792
Yeah, so?

10:24.825 --> 10:26.026
So?

10:26.059 --> 10:28.195
So it says they could
demand their money back

10:28.228 --> 10:29.863
with interest
at any time

10:29.897 --> 10:31.765
if they determine
that a mistake was made.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.767
Baby, they send that
letter to everybody.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.402
Well, what if they want
their money back?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.070
Where am I going
to get it from?

10:37.104 --> 10:38.405
Julius, you got
better odds

10:38.438 --> 10:39.873
of being struck
by lightening

10:39.907 --> 10:41.742
than the IRS wanting
their money back.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.410
Statistically, she was right.

10:50.951 --> 10:55.355
Besides, what's the worst
that can happen?

10:55.388 --> 10:56.423
JULIUS:
Where did they go...?

10:56.456 --> 10:57.858
What is go...
Oh, my...

10:57.891 --> 10:59.192
Dad, they
took the TV.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.928
Julius, they took
my wigs.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.095
Ow!

11:02.129 --> 11:03.430
Dad... They're taking Tonya.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.868
No!

11:09.469 --> 11:11.939
Name brand cereal
is like crack to kids.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.307
And when Tonya and Drew opened
that variety pack,

11:14.341 --> 11:16.143
they became snap,
crackle and pop heads.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.444
TONYA:
Drew, give it!

11:17.477 --> 11:18.979
DREW:
No, I called
the Chocalot.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.814
TONYA:
Mama, Drew took
my Chocalots.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.449
Both of y'all, get in here now.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.085
Julius, they driving me
crazy behind this cereal.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.720
Well, Drew did call
the Chocalots.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.055
I don't care who called what.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.790
It's too early
for all this arguing.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.024
Drew, give your sister
the cereal.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.325
Fine.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.762
But tomorrow I call
the Fruit Hoops.
No, Ma, I...

11:34.795 --> 11:36.363
Girl, don't press your luck
before I knock

11:36.396 --> 11:37.430
the Rice Krispies
out of you.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.399
DREW:
Man, who ate up all
the Cereal Smack?

11:39.432 --> 11:41.802
I called the Cereal Smacks.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.071
See?

11:44.104 --> 11:45.873
I called them.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.507
After a few days, I found out

11:47.540 --> 11:50.077
I had a lot more in common
with Albert

11:50.110 --> 11:51.478
than I had with Greg.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.480
Hey, check this dude out.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.148
Hey, Mario?

11:55.182 --> 11:56.416
Your mama's so stupid,

11:56.449 --> 11:58.752
she thought a quarterback
was a refund.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.188
Oh, yeah?

12:01.221 --> 12:03.423
Su mama es la mariscal
de la cancha.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.928
Now we're going to get fined
by the Mexican FCC.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.030
Hey, I'll be right back.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.835
What'd you do that for?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.536
I was just having a little fun.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.772
Fun for who?

12:24.177 --> 12:26.814
Okay, now this is an easy one.

12:26.847 --> 12:30.483
Who was the only president
to ever be impeached?

12:32.152 --> 12:33.921
Chris?

12:34.554 --> 12:36.924
Uh, George Washington Carver?

12:38.158 --> 12:39.492
No, Chris.

12:39.526 --> 12:42.262
George Washington Carver
was the black peanut genius.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.831
And you should know that.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.532
Albert?

12:45.565 --> 12:47.000
I don't know.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.836
What do you mean,
you don't know?

12:48.869 --> 12:50.437
Did you read
the assigned material?

12:50.470 --> 12:51.939
You can read, can't you?

12:51.972 --> 12:53.941
Yeah, I can read.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.143
Well, then,
there's no excuse for you not

12:56.176 --> 12:57.978
having studied. Now,

12:58.011 --> 13:00.413
I know you and Chris
are having fun

13:00.447 --> 13:02.549
shucking and jiving

13:02.582 --> 13:04.852
together, but you
should really spend

13:04.885 --> 13:05.886
more time studying...

13:05.919 --> 13:06.887
Albert looked at her

13:06.920 --> 13:09.522
like he was about
to get his third strike.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.995
What's wrong with you?

13:15.028 --> 13:16.596
Can you believe what she said?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.465
It's not that big
of a deal, man.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.333
It's nothing worse than
what she said to me.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.501
Forget her.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.837
No, I ain't forgetting nothing.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.939
I'll bet you
she won't do that again.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.040
What do you mean?

13:27.074 --> 13:29.076
We're going to pay her back.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.345
I think I just joined a gang.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.446
Who's we?

13:33.480 --> 13:36.583
As it turned out,
Albert could not only read.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.818
He could also write.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.127
Way to go, Basquiat.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.328
I didn't do this.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.330
Sure you didn't.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.934
Who would possess
the vulgar cultural background

13:53.967 --> 13:56.203
and raw, angry,
street talent to do

13:56.236 --> 13:57.905
something like this?

13:57.938 --> 14:00.140
I'll give you one guess,
and it starts with Albert.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.079
Hey, Albert.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.514
Did you see it?

14:07.547 --> 14:08.615
Yeah, I saw it.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.017
Pretty cool, huh?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.384
We put her in her place.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.553
What is with this we?

14:13.586 --> 14:15.455
I had nothing
to do with this.

14:15.488 --> 14:16.924
Well, you know...

14:16.957 --> 14:18.091
No, I don't know.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.292
Caruso thinks I did it.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.428
Yeah, well, you and me?
It's the same thing.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.997
Solidarity, right?

14:24.031 --> 14:26.399
Solidarity... wrong.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.368
You took
this too far.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.436
Now you need to
tell Ms. Morello

14:29.469 --> 14:30.537
what you did,
or I'm going to.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.072
Oh, it's like that, huh?

14:32.105 --> 14:33.406
Yeah, it's like that.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.276
And that's the
way it is. Ugh!

14:36.309 --> 14:38.578
That sounded a lot cooler
in my head.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.313
Okay, then I'll tell her.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.349
I'm not scared.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.054
I'm deeply disappointed in you,

14:47.087 --> 14:48.221
Chris.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.656
I thought we had a connection,

14:49.689 --> 14:53.626
and yet, you go and spray paint
those awful words.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.563
Wait. Didn't Albert talk to you?

14:56.596 --> 14:57.597
Yes. Your friend
came in here,

14:57.630 --> 15:00.968
and as hard as it was
for him to turn you in,

15:01.001 --> 15:02.936
he did the right thing
by letting me know

15:02.970 --> 15:05.005
you were the one who
defaced school property.

15:05.038 --> 15:05.973
But it wasn't me.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.207
I didn't do it.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.076
Don't try to deny it, mister.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.643
I know in your culture,

15:10.677 --> 15:12.579
people think that
word is a compliment,

15:12.612 --> 15:14.681
but in this
instance, it's not.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.517
Ms. Morello, Albert's the one
who spray painted that wall.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.719
I know you were embarrassed
for your friend

15:19.752 --> 15:21.188
because he didn't study,

15:21.221 --> 15:23.991
but you're not helping
him by calling me names.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.193
Sticks and stones, Chris.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.095
I know where I'd like
to stick a stone.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.262
I'm giving you detention.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.430
That's not fair.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.299
I told you I didn't do it.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.367
And furthermore, you're
going to clean that wall.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.070
Give it,
or I'm going to tell.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.972
Tonya, you didn't even
want the Frosty Flakes

15:39.006 --> 15:39.739
until I had them. Stop!

15:39.772 --> 15:41.341
So, you can eat
Crazy Bran.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.010
I'm not eating the
Crazy Bran, Tonya. Stop!

15:43.043 --> 15:44.644
Stop! You're spilling it!

15:44.677 --> 15:46.679
Hey!

15:46.713 --> 15:48.982
Give me those darn cereal!

15:50.017 --> 15:52.352
I'm sick of y'all fighting
over cereal.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.554
Every day, y'all...

15:54.587 --> 15:57.490
your life's bigger that cereal!

15:57.524 --> 15:59.026
It's cereal!

16:09.769 --> 16:11.771
Now eat the damn cereal!

16:11.804 --> 16:14.407
Eat the Damn Cereal.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.076
Coming soon from Kellogg's.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.086
Can I help you?

16:26.119 --> 16:28.255
I've got a hypothetical
question for you.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.289
Okay.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.758
What are the chances

16:31.791 --> 16:35.662
that the IRS would demand
a refund on a tax refund?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.164
Hypothetically?

16:37.197 --> 16:38.231
Hypothetically.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.133
Well, that hardly
ever happens.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.701
Really?
Yes. Almost never.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.036
Almost?

16:43.070 --> 16:44.271
Very rarely.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.272
How rare?

16:45.305 --> 16:46.506
Uh, it's unlikely.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.075
I mean, it could take years

16:48.108 --> 16:49.776
if they ever even
caught the mistake,

16:49.809 --> 16:51.211
but they probably wouldn't.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.113
How probable is that probably?

16:53.146 --> 16:55.348
Did you cash the refund check?

16:55.382 --> 16:57.250
Hypothetically?

16:57.284 --> 16:58.418
Yes.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.786
No.

16:59.819 --> 17:02.289
Good.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.290
But my hypothetical wife did.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.592
Oh.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.161
Oh? Oh, hey,
what's oh

17:08.195 --> 17:09.829
Well, if you got a larger
than normal refund,

17:09.862 --> 17:11.798
um, it's possible you aren't
aware of some benefit.

17:11.831 --> 17:14.267
Although the IRS takes a lot
of money by accident,

17:14.301 --> 17:16.836
we usually don't
give money away by accident.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.838
You'll probably be okay.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.508
Hypothetically.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.809
Probably?
Possibly.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.177
Maybe.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.745
I hope.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.116
Thanks.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.153
My father wasn't the only one

17:33.186 --> 17:35.288
stressed out
because of that refund.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.134
What are you doing?

17:47.167 --> 17:49.436
I'm trying to clean
this mess off the wall.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.738
I can see that, but why?
You didn't do it.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.207
I know, but nobody
seems to believe me.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.509
I guess I should have listened
to you about Albert.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.744
I guess you should have.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.579
Sorry.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.314
So am I.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.517
It's better to hang out
with friends

18:04.551 --> 18:06.886
that get you out of trouble,
not into it.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.755
If only Tupac had known that.

18:08.788 --> 18:12.192
While I was worrying
about my problem,

18:12.225 --> 18:13.760
my father had problems
of his own.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.328
Julius,

18:15.362 --> 18:16.763
is something wrong
with your food?

18:16.796 --> 18:19.332
No, uh, I'm just not hungry.

18:19.366 --> 18:22.535
For my father to waste food,
that could only mean one thing.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.405
Hell must have frozen over.

18:25.438 --> 18:29.142
Damn, it's cold!

18:31.378 --> 18:32.712
Julius, what's wrong?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.682
I can't stop worrying
about this refund.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.384
I mean, I keep having
these nightmares

18:37.417 --> 18:39.386
the government's going
to take all we own,

18:39.419 --> 18:41.321
and we have to end up
living in the street.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.256
That is not going to happen.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.424
It happened to Red Fox.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.525
How do you know?

18:45.558 --> 18:47.227
'Cause I'm not living
in the streets.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.162
If everybody in this house
has to get two jobs,

18:49.196 --> 18:50.563
we'll find a way to pay

18:50.597 --> 18:51.598
the money back.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.566
Yeah, I can pick up
some extra hours at Doc's.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.834
Do I have to get two jobs?

18:54.867 --> 18:57.170
Well, if you want to stay here
with two parents

18:57.204 --> 18:59.239
and two brothers, yes,
you have to get two jobs.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.274
But what if I get one job,
and I keep Daddy?

19:01.308 --> 19:02.609
Girl, don't
play with me.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.744
Well, I could get a
job as a bullfighter

19:04.777 --> 19:05.945
and get a paper route.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.814
Boy, I'm not going
to let you kill yourself

19:07.847 --> 19:09.282
out there on no paper route.

19:09.316 --> 19:09.916
Chris, you take
the paper route.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.418
Drew, why don't you

19:11.451 --> 19:12.419
find something else to do?

19:12.452 --> 19:14.187
Okay.

19:14.221 --> 19:17.657
Oh, you guys would really
do that for me?

19:17.690 --> 19:18.891
In a heartbeat.

19:18.925 --> 19:19.859
Baby, if the IRS

19:19.892 --> 19:22.395
knocks on this door,
we'll be ready for them.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.930
Okay?
Okay.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.598
Now, eat
your food.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.200
That night, my family showed me

19:27.234 --> 19:29.236
what it meant
to have someone's back,

19:29.269 --> 19:30.970
and I realized that Greg,
not Albert,

19:31.003 --> 19:33.206
would always have mine.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.741
I hope you're happy.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.609
They found the paint
cans in my locker.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.678
I got expelled.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.980
That's not my fault.
I didn't say anything.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.749
Then who did?
Me.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.285
I saw what you did,
but I didn't want

19:45.318 --> 19:47.254
to say anything until
you got Chris in trouble.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.322
Then I told
Ms. Morello.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.494
Oh, yeah.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.828
Here.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.731
I changed my mind
about the game.

19:58.765 --> 20:02.402
I didn't really want to go
with you anyway.

20:02.435 --> 20:05.805
This is just like when
Bobby Brown left New Edition.

20:05.838 --> 20:09.342
Thanks for getting me
out of detention.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.411
Don't mention it. You'd
do the same for me.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.879
Greg was right. I would.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.681
Because when it came
to our friendship,

20:14.714 --> 20:15.848
we didn't see color.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.384
Hey, Count Chocula.
Hey, Captain Crunch.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.651
Never would have happened

20:18.685 --> 20:20.820
if I had convinced Greg
to wear black face.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.822
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.858
