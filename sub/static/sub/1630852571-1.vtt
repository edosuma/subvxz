WEBVTT

06:14.300 --> 06:17.003
I'm not saying
I'm anti-feminist.

06:17.036 --> 06:19.972
What I'm saying is,
some feminists take it

06:20.006 --> 06:21.907
way too far.

06:21.941 --> 06:23.541
Oh so,
because you're uncomfortable

06:23.575 --> 06:24.710
with some of it,

06:24.744 --> 06:25.754
all women should just shut up
and not say anything?

06:25.778 --> 06:27.747
When you say
that men are the reason

06:27.780 --> 06:28.714
the world sucks?

06:28.748 --> 06:31.017
Yes, I think it's bullshit.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.219
Men have screwed up some
history, sure,

06:33.252 --> 06:36.088
but Eve ate the apple first.

06:36.122 --> 06:37.056
Oh, my God.

06:37.089 --> 06:38.090
It's true.

06:38.124 --> 06:39.564
How do you live with this
guy, Sarah?

06:40.860 --> 06:41.761
Sarah!

06:41.794 --> 06:42.795
Sorry, what?

06:42.828 --> 06:43.629
You hear your husband?

06:43.662 --> 06:45.765
Yeah, how dare I not just roll
over

06:45.798 --> 06:46.966
and let you shit all over men.

06:46.999 --> 06:48.768
Sorry, if you can't comprehend
someone

06:48.801 --> 06:49.811
actually standing up to you...

06:49.835 --> 06:51.170
Daniel.

06:54.006 --> 06:56.308
Hey, man, are you sure
the forest doesn't close

06:56.342 --> 06:58.144
at night?

06:58.177 --> 07:00.146
How the hell are you gonna close
a forest?

07:01.881 --> 07:02.848
Anyway, what was I saying?

07:02.882 --> 07:05.751
Shitting on women and continuing
the patriarchy.

07:05.785 --> 07:07.162
See, that's what
I'm talking about, Naomi.

07:07.186 --> 07:07.987
Any time...

07:08.020 --> 07:09.789
Daniel, I think we get your
point.

07:09.822 --> 07:11.623
No, let him finish, Sarah.

07:11.657 --> 07:14.093
Overconfident mansplaining is my
favorite dish to feed on.

07:14.126 --> 07:15.694
See! Right there!

07:15.728 --> 07:16.695
That's what I'm saying,

07:16.729 --> 07:18.230
anytime a man has an opinion...

07:18.264 --> 07:20.699
An opinion on something a man
don't get an opinion on.

07:20.733 --> 07:22.802
I'd like to go on record
and say that

07:22.835 --> 07:25.071
I, 100% support feminism.

07:25.104 --> 07:28.908
Oh, thank you, baby.
That's all I need to hear.

07:28.941 --> 07:30.276
Now, mind ya' business.

07:30.309 --> 07:31.911
Right.

07:31.944 --> 07:34.280
All I am saying, is that

07:34.313 --> 07:37.683
no matter what some feminists
wanna turn men into,

07:37.716 --> 07:38.851
y'all need us.

07:38.884 --> 07:40.920
Men are providers,
men are protectors.

07:40.953 --> 07:41.954
It's in our DNA.

07:41.987 --> 07:42.587
Wow.

07:42.620 --> 07:43.522
You can wow all you want.

07:43.556 --> 07:46.092
You know it's true.
Women want a man.

07:46.125 --> 07:48.094
James, you can have a woman run
the whole world,

07:48.127 --> 07:49.395
if she's not satisfied...

07:49.428 --> 07:51.330
Sarah, I seriously hope
your home life

07:51.363 --> 07:53.199
is not like a 1960s commercial,

07:53.232 --> 07:54.333
because I just...

07:54.366 --> 07:56.735
I would love if we could just
move on.

07:56.769 --> 07:59.738
So, I'm not allowed to have an
opinion on your shit,

07:59.772 --> 08:02.675
but you're allowed to have
an opinion on mine?

08:02.708 --> 08:04.052
James, you didn't tell me your
friend wanted

08:04.076 --> 08:05.211
all the smoke.

08:05.244 --> 08:06.321
Hey James,
will you tell your girlfriend

08:06.345 --> 08:08.314
that if she's gonna serve it,
she better be ready

08:08.347 --> 08:09.347
to take it.

08:11.016 --> 08:12.151
What?

08:16.055 --> 08:19.091
Sarah, it must be nice having
such a dedicated provider

08:19.125 --> 08:21.327
take care of you.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.263
What is it that you do again for
work, Daniel?

08:26.932 --> 08:28.868
You're funny.

08:29.502 --> 08:33.806
I think any relationship should
be give and take.

08:33.839 --> 08:37.376
Sometimes one person supports
the other and vice versa.

08:38.110 --> 08:39.187
And I don't think either of you

08:39.211 --> 08:42.114
are really shitting
on anyone except each other.

09:14.813 --> 09:16.315
Hmm.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.317
What is that?

09:18.350 --> 09:20.286
Oh, it's the park ranger.

09:24.423 --> 09:26.201
See, I told you we're not
supposed to be out here.

09:26.225 --> 09:27.760
Just chill, man.
We're fine, alright?

09:27.793 --> 09:28.793
I got this.

09:47.813 --> 09:48.380
How are you, sir?

09:48.414 --> 09:50.182
Doing well, thank you.

09:50.216 --> 09:51.083
Where y'all headed?

09:51.116 --> 09:52.151
Bear Lake.

09:52.184 --> 09:53.995
Heard the catfish are really
biting this season.

09:54.019 --> 09:55.754
Little late for that,
don't you think?

09:59.091 --> 10:00.993
Oh, we're taking these
two back for the weekend.

10:01.026 --> 10:02.394
Gonna hit the lake
in the morning.

10:04.964 --> 10:07.266
Not many people know
about Bear Lake.

10:07.833 --> 10:09.235
I do.

10:09.868 --> 10:12.104
Alright, well, we warning people
not to venture out

10:12.137 --> 10:15.307
that far, especially this late.

10:15.341 --> 10:16.775
But if you know the area,

10:16.809 --> 10:18.344
just keep your heads up.

10:18.377 --> 10:20.479
We've had a busy season for IRs.

10:21.046 --> 10:22.781
IR's?

10:22.815 --> 10:24.216
Incident reports.

10:24.250 --> 10:28.087
Missing hikers, strange
sightings, you name it.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.055
We'll keep our heads up.

10:30.089 --> 10:35.094
Good, 'cause you're be alone
out there.

10:35.127 --> 10:36.962
Fine. That's how it should be.

10:36.996 --> 10:40.933
I've got a flare gun in here,
just in case.

10:46.338 --> 10:49.141
You realize you can burn down an
entire forest with that?

10:50.309 --> 10:52.478
It's...
it's just for emergencies.

10:54.046 --> 10:55.981
Mhmm.

10:57.583 --> 10:59.218
Y'all be safe.

11:00.286 --> 11:02.187
Thank you, sir.

11:38.357 --> 11:40.993
The fuck, man, really?

11:41.026 --> 11:41.927
What?

11:41.960 --> 11:43.271
You're gonna talk
to an officer like that

11:43.295 --> 11:45.230
with two black people
in the back?

11:45.264 --> 11:46.532
Yeah.

11:46.565 --> 11:47.610
You said you were
South American...

11:47.634 --> 11:48.400
Officers don't care.

11:48.434 --> 11:50.002
They see dark skin
and they just...

11:50.035 --> 11:52.471
Okay, first,
he's not an officer...

11:52.504 --> 11:53.238
He has a badge.

11:53.272 --> 11:54.139
That's all the power he needs!

11:54.173 --> 11:56.909
Second, he has to tell us
to be safe.

11:56.942 --> 11:58.177
It's literally his job.

11:58.210 --> 11:59.578
That is not what I heard it.

12:01.513 --> 12:04.550
So, how are you going to conquer
the world

12:04.583 --> 12:08.220
if you're too afraid to sleep in
the woods?

12:08.587 --> 12:10.565
Well, look, at least we got
a road trip out of this.

12:10.589 --> 12:12.458
Uh, we're still going.

12:12.858 --> 12:16.328
Babe, I know you were really
looking forward

12:16.362 --> 12:17.429
to this weekend,

12:17.463 --> 12:18.397
but that ranger made it sound
like...

12:18.430 --> 12:21.100
There is something out there
killing people!

12:25.537 --> 12:28.006
That's what you took from that
conversation?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.241
I can read between the lines.

12:29.274 --> 12:30.677
That's not what he said at all.

12:30.710 --> 12:32.378
Yeah, we're going, thank you.

12:32.411 --> 12:34.446
Oh, so now you speak
for everyone?

12:35.981 --> 12:37.116
Not as good as you.

12:37.149 --> 12:37.983
Pendejo.

12:38.016 --> 12:39.327
Okay, you two,
you've been going at it

12:39.351 --> 12:41.453
since we got on the road.

12:41.487 --> 12:42.354
Let's just take a vote.

12:42.388 --> 12:44.390
No, we're not taking a vote.

12:44.423 --> 12:45.324
I vote no.

12:45.357 --> 12:46.392
I'm with him.

12:46.425 --> 12:47.025
Are you serious?

12:47.059 --> 12:48.594
We came out here to relax.

12:48.628 --> 12:52.164
And so far, nothing about this
trip has been relaxing.

12:52.197 --> 12:53.899
And who's fault is that?

12:55.167 --> 12:57.202
Naomi, what do you think?

13:02.574 --> 13:05.377
Well, do I want to come out here
with the alligators

13:05.411 --> 13:07.212
and the rangers that
are probably in the KKK?

13:07.246 --> 13:08.380
Not really.

13:10.182 --> 13:11.950
But I cannot spend another
weekend

13:11.984 --> 13:13.452
cooped up in the apartment with
him.

13:13.485 --> 13:14.553
No offense, babe.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.189
And I will literally
murder your husband

13:17.222 --> 13:19.425
if he tries to call me scared.

13:20.627 --> 13:22.561
Plus, we've got a flare gun!

13:22.594 --> 13:24.329
What the hell could go wrong?

13:26.766 --> 13:28.500
Tied at two.

13:33.138 --> 13:35.307
Fine, let's go.

13:37.443 --> 13:38.678
Thank you.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.218
I have a bad feeling about this.

14:14.781 --> 14:17.717
Wow, look at that sunset.

14:19.686 --> 14:22.120
It's good-looking sunset.

14:22.154 --> 14:24.523
Alright, walk in from here.

14:24.556 --> 14:26.425
Walk in? Walk in where, Daniel?

14:26.458 --> 14:27.698
I thought we were already at...

14:35.400 --> 14:38.103
I don't have to walk forever
or mosquitoes biting forever.

14:38.136 --> 14:39.304
Biting.

14:39.806 --> 14:42.207
It is pretty out here.

14:53.786 --> 14:56.388
Do one thing for me
this weekend.

14:56.421 --> 14:58.090
Grow a pair.

15:02.829 --> 15:05.464
Oh, I'll grow a pair.

15:08.433 --> 15:10.335
Ooh.

15:10.970 --> 15:13.338
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

15:15.541 --> 15:18.778
Get that bad boy, yes.

15:25.250 --> 15:28.387
Daniel! Daniel!

15:28.420 --> 15:29.656
Hurry.

15:29.689 --> 15:31.256
Well... well, can you wait?

15:33.559 --> 15:34.770
So,
the truck driver asked the woman

15:34.794 --> 15:36.461
if she needed a ride.

15:36.495 --> 15:37.429
Now why wouldn't he, right?

15:37.462 --> 15:41.768
She's real hot,
she's by herself, crying,

15:41.801 --> 15:43.201
all alone.

15:43.235 --> 15:45.437
She says, yes, she gets in,

15:45.470 --> 15:48.340
he keeps on going,
just deep into the woods.

15:48.373 --> 15:49.752
Feeling pretty good about
himself, right,

15:49.776 --> 15:51.844
thinks he's about to get laid.

15:51.878 --> 15:56.548
A few days later
some hikers find his body.

15:56.582 --> 16:00.586
Two bullet holes
from a .22 caliber handgun.

16:01.688 --> 16:03.121
When the hell will you men
learn,

16:03.155 --> 16:04.499
when you see a woman walking in
the woods,

16:04.523 --> 16:06.659
leave her the fuck alone.

16:06.693 --> 16:09.261
And that happened here? When?

16:09.294 --> 16:11.229
1990.

16:12.130 --> 16:14.399
That story was cute,
but I got one better.

16:14.433 --> 16:15.601
Eh, I'm not even done.

16:15.635 --> 16:17.870
And it involves
a hot-ass chick, too

16:18.705 --> 16:21.173
So, before grandma moved to the
States,

16:21.206 --> 16:22.909
she grew up in Colombia.

16:22.942 --> 16:24.677
South America.

16:24.711 --> 16:26.646
From childhood they
were told stories

16:26.679 --> 16:29.649
about monsters that who lived
in the Amazon.

16:29.682 --> 16:31.522
But one monster always
stuck out to me, because

16:31.550 --> 16:35.922
it's one she says
our ancestors actually saw.

16:35.955 --> 16:39.124
The woman who haunts the jungle
on one leg.

16:40.359 --> 16:43.562
When she first appears,
she's beautiful,

16:43.595 --> 16:46.164
that's how she lures you in.

16:46.866 --> 16:51.169
But when you seen her true form,
it's way too late.

16:52.137 --> 16:56.408
Legend has it that
she was a beautiful woman

16:56.441 --> 16:58.711
who cheated on her husband.

16:58.745 --> 17:01.714
When she got caught,
he murdered their children

17:01.748 --> 17:03.716
in front of her,
then chopped off her leg

17:03.750 --> 17:06.719
and left her to die.

17:06.752 --> 17:10.288
Now, centuries later
she haunts dense forests,

17:10.321 --> 17:11.623
just like this one,

17:11.657 --> 17:15.359
looking for men who are
unfaithful to their wives.

17:15.994 --> 17:21.233
And some families say,
she's got fangs, and claws,

17:21.266 --> 17:23.502
and a hoof.

17:23.535 --> 17:26.405
But others say,
just like a vampire

17:26.438 --> 17:28.841
she sucks your blood.

17:28.875 --> 17:32.611
One thing they all agree on is
that once she's claimed

17:32.645 --> 17:39.786
her victim, she sings this
hauntingly beautiful song

17:39.819 --> 17:42.254
you can hear it through
the forest.

17:47.894 --> 17:50.295
Wait a minute.

17:50.328 --> 17:51.898
Women cheat, too.

17:51.931 --> 17:53.532
So what does she just let them
go?

17:53.565 --> 17:55.635
'Cause that is sexist.

17:55.668 --> 17:58.838
The women, she bewitches.

17:58.871 --> 18:00.740
That means she possesses their
bodies.

18:00.773 --> 18:02.340
Ah.

18:02.875 --> 18:05.277
Apparently, the only people
immune

18:05.310 --> 18:07.814
are those with legit
purity in their hearts.

18:07.847 --> 18:10.850
No unfaithfulness, no ill
will toward anyone

18:11.050 --> 18:13.418
So non-cheaters are safe?

18:13.452 --> 18:15.287
Like, she just doesn't come
after them?

18:15.320 --> 18:18.658
Apparently, they don't even
see her when she's around.

18:19.458 --> 18:21.894
Oh, okay, I'm good.

18:21.928 --> 18:23.295
That's lame.

18:23.328 --> 18:24.296
Babe, make out with Naomi.

18:24.329 --> 18:25.732
See if she shows up.

18:25.765 --> 18:27.900
Daniel!

18:27.934 --> 18:29.301
What? You wanna kiss James?

18:29.334 --> 18:30.837
You can kiss my ass.

18:30.870 --> 18:33.806
I just think my story's better,
I'm sorry.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.507
In your story,
if you're not a cheater,

18:35.540 --> 18:36.952
there's just nothing
to be afraid of.

18:36.976 --> 18:39.912
That's according to one version
of the legend.

18:40.813 --> 18:41.781
What's her name?

18:41.814 --> 18:43.049
Oh, no, I'm not saying.

18:43.082 --> 18:44.082
No.

18:47.954 --> 18:50.622
Legend says that if you say
her name, it invites

18:50.656 --> 18:51.556
her presence.

18:51.590 --> 18:54.292
Just like a moment of weakness
can invite

18:54.326 --> 18:56.361
unfaithfulness into
your relationship.

18:57.096 --> 18:58.965
You really want me
to bring all that on us?

18:58.998 --> 19:01.033
Oh, like Candyman.
No, thank you.

19:01.067 --> 19:01.868
You guys are weak.

19:01.901 --> 19:03.903
I'm not saying it.
I'm not stupid.

19:03.936 --> 19:05.972
I just... She tries to be so
hard.

19:06.005 --> 19:07.883
You know, I just wouldn't
imagine her being afraid

19:07.907 --> 19:10.009
of her grandmother's
ghost story.

19:16.348 --> 19:18.283
She's called, "La Patasola".

19:30.763 --> 19:32.732
Anticlimactic.

19:33.866 --> 19:36.601
Seriously? La Pata-solo?

19:36.636 --> 19:39.005
Come on, it sounds like
a Star Wars character.

19:42.541 --> 19:44.911
Ooh, it was me, I did it.

19:44.944 --> 19:45.944
Here.

19:49.514 --> 19:51.392
Yeah, I'd love to see something
try me right now.

19:51.416 --> 19:52.952
Daniel.

19:54.619 --> 19:56.789
What?

20:00.059 --> 20:02.527
We need more firewood.

20:11.737 --> 20:12.738
Mmm.

20:17.844 --> 20:18.476
Seriously.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.112
You said her name.

20:25.117 --> 20:26.786
Just in case.

20:34.927 --> 20:36.996
That fire was weird, right?
Guys?

20:50.910 --> 20:52.078
What's up?

20:52.111 --> 20:54.780
Nothing. It's just...

20:54.814 --> 20:56.481
What?

20:57.116 --> 20:58.550
You were harsh today.

20:58.583 --> 21:00.019
Harsh?

21:00.052 --> 21:02.021
You've been rude
to Naomi all day.

21:02.054 --> 21:04.489
She doesn't care, babe.

21:05.057 --> 21:07.727
It's not personal
with chicks like that.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.762
I've met a ton of them, okay.

21:09.795 --> 21:11.898
They live to argue.

21:11.931 --> 21:13.766
She probably wishes
James would stand up

21:13.799 --> 21:15.101
to her like that.

21:15.134 --> 21:17.069
Well, you don't have
to egg her on.

21:18.738 --> 21:20.139
So, when she belittles me

21:20.172 --> 21:21.307
for not having a job,

21:21.340 --> 21:23.508
because I'm trying to get
my business off the ground,

21:23.541 --> 21:24.476
that's okay.

21:24.509 --> 21:27.680
But when I serve it back
to her, I am harsh?

21:30.049 --> 21:31.416
Never mind.

21:32.184 --> 21:33.786
'Cause you know
I'm working my ass off.

21:33.819 --> 21:35.721
I know you are.

21:59.979 --> 22:00.880
Did you hear that?

22:00.913 --> 22:03.215
It's just the wind.

22:05.217 --> 22:07.585
I don't know if that's the wind.

22:07.619 --> 22:10.488
Then it's Naomi messing with us.

22:10.522 --> 22:12.825
You heard the ranger,
we're alone out here.

22:20.933 --> 22:22.868
Fine.

22:24.303 --> 22:25.938
I'll go check.

22:40.953 --> 22:42.764
What are you doing?
That doesn't sound like him.

22:42.788 --> 22:45.725
What he's not gonna do
is make me think I'm crazy.

22:45.758 --> 22:47.860
How can he make that sound?

22:56.869 --> 22:58.603
You hear that?

23:00.072 --> 23:01.240
That wasn't you?

23:01.273 --> 23:03.541
I'm over here.

23:13.819 --> 23:16.222
Yeah, I knew it.
It's just the wind.

23:16.255 --> 23:19.125
The hell kinda wind is that?

23:19.158 --> 23:22.995
Shouldn't tell ghost stories
if you can't handle 'em.

23:30.736 --> 23:31.737
Yep.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.308
I'm so sorry.

24:09.341 --> 24:10.743
I didn't get any sleep
last night.

24:10.776 --> 24:13.145
I'm just jumpy today.

24:13.179 --> 24:15.081
It was those ghost stories,
wasn't it?

24:15.114 --> 24:16.115
No.

24:16.949 --> 24:19.285
Because you know
they're not real.

24:19.318 --> 24:20.986
Mhmm.

24:31.964 --> 24:33.399
This ain't working.

24:33.432 --> 24:34.834
I'm so sorry.

24:34.867 --> 24:37.103
Girl, stop apologizing.

24:38.070 --> 24:40.372
I know, it's a habit. Sorry.

24:53.752 --> 24:55.855
You said, you wanted
to relax, right?

25:01.827 --> 25:04.630
So, Naomi's a little different

25:05.231 --> 25:06.999
from your usual type, huh?

25:07.867 --> 25:10.803
Yeah, that's the point.

25:10.836 --> 25:12.872
To be a pushover?

25:12.905 --> 25:15.407
Okay, she...
she does not push me over.

25:16.208 --> 25:19.245
It's cute when someone
finishes your sentences,

25:19.278 --> 25:22.748
but it's borderline abuse when
someone talks for,

25:22.781 --> 25:24.750
over, and at you.

25:26.218 --> 25:28.454
Okay, she's not all that bad.

25:28.487 --> 25:29.388
Oh, yeah?

25:29.421 --> 25:30.089
Yeah.

25:30.122 --> 25:31.223
How's the sex?

25:31.257 --> 25:33.159
Oh, my goodness.

25:33.192 --> 25:35.103
But wait, don't think you're
gonna steal this one from me

25:35.127 --> 25:36.829
like you did in high school.

25:36.862 --> 25:37.763
I can fight now.

25:37.796 --> 25:40.132
Bro, I told you
not to fall for Charlene.

25:40.166 --> 25:41.943
She hooked up with everybody
on the baseball team.

25:41.967 --> 25:43.369
I was...
I was just next in line.

25:43.402 --> 25:44.846
Yeah, well, na...
Well, Naomi ain't Charlene.

25:44.870 --> 25:45.905
Oh.

25:45.938 --> 25:47.840
I'ma marry this one.

25:49.308 --> 25:51.043
You serious?

25:52.211 --> 25:54.380
- Hey!
- Yeah.

25:54.413 --> 25:56.749
You really gonna do that?

25:56.782 --> 25:57.950
Do what?

25:57.983 --> 25:59.985
Marry Naomi.

26:00.019 --> 26:01.019
Yea...

26:01.687 --> 26:03.789
Dude, cut it out,
you're creeping me out.

26:03.822 --> 26:07.359
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yes.

26:07.393 --> 26:08.861
Naomi is the one.

26:08.894 --> 26:09.894
She's the one.

26:11.163 --> 26:13.065
I brought the ring with me.

26:13.098 --> 26:14.142
I'ma do it while we're here.

26:14.166 --> 26:15.000
No, you're not.

26:15.034 --> 26:16.468
Yes, sir.

26:20.539 --> 26:22.474
What was that?

26:25.844 --> 26:28.747
Catfish. It's a big one.

26:34.553 --> 26:37.022
You were right,
that helps a lot.

26:37.056 --> 26:38.090
I got you.

26:46.065 --> 26:48.000
How do you do it?

26:49.201 --> 26:50.102
Do what?

26:50.135 --> 26:54.273
I don't know. You're just so...
blunt.

26:55.407 --> 26:58.544
I mean... I mean strong,
like you know what you want

26:58.577 --> 27:00.913
and you just say it.

27:00.946 --> 27:02.114
Why wouldn't I say it?

27:02.147 --> 27:02.915
You should.

27:02.948 --> 27:05.517
And I do.
It's that simple, babe.

27:06.518 --> 27:09.021
Um, not for me.

27:16.528 --> 27:18.497
Do you think you matter?

27:18.530 --> 27:19.365
Uh, yeah.

27:19.398 --> 27:21.100
Bullshit.

27:21.867 --> 27:26.572
If you really believed that, you
would demand to be heard.

27:26.605 --> 27:29.908
You would demand that your voice
meant just as much

27:29.942 --> 27:32.845
as everyone else on this planet.

27:32.878 --> 27:34.947
Daniel ain't shit.

27:34.980 --> 27:36.482
No offense. He's your guy.

27:37.950 --> 27:40.019
But, to everybody else
in this world,

27:40.052 --> 27:42.154
he is no different
than you or me.

27:43.555 --> 27:46.025
You just have to know
what you want.

27:46.058 --> 27:47.426
I know what I want.

27:47.459 --> 27:49.995
Yeah, but it can't be like
happiness or something...

27:50.029 --> 27:53.132
I want to quit my job.

27:53.165 --> 27:54.400
Oh, shit.

27:54.433 --> 27:56.335
I wanna go to nursing school.

27:57.202 --> 27:58.904
Good shit.

28:00.139 --> 28:02.141
Now, all you have to
do is tell Daniel that.

28:02.174 --> 28:03.876
We can't afford it.

28:03.909 --> 28:05.511
I'm the only one
with any income since

28:05.544 --> 28:09.181
Daniel's been trying
to get the business going.

28:09.214 --> 28:11.450
No, and I've always believed
that relationships

28:11.483 --> 28:12.885
are never 50-50.

28:12.918 --> 28:14.620
Sometimes
they're 60-40, 70-30...

28:14.654 --> 28:16.064
How much longer
are you gonna sacrifice

28:16.088 --> 28:17.456
your happiness?

28:21.293 --> 28:24.363
If he's your partner,
that 60-40 has to swing

28:24.396 --> 28:26.565
the other way at some point.

28:26.598 --> 28:29.134
You got dreams, girl.

28:29.168 --> 28:30.578
And if you let Daniel
keep you from them,

28:30.602 --> 28:32.639
you're gonna hate him.

28:32.672 --> 28:35.140
And worse, you're gonna'
hate yourself.

28:40.312 --> 28:43.048
Can I give you a piece of
advice, bro?

28:44.917 --> 28:47.553
If you think Naomi is the one,

28:47.586 --> 28:50.589
then you have got to
stand up to her.

28:51.323 --> 28:55.094
Chicks like that, they just need
somebody who can see 'em

28:55.127 --> 28:56.495
eye to eye, you know?

28:58.197 --> 29:02.134
I don't know, man.
She's everything I'm not.

29:03.001 --> 29:05.204
Like, isn't your wife supposed
to complete you?

29:05.237 --> 29:07.106
Complete you, yeah,
not control you.

29:07.139 --> 29:09.241
She doesn't control me.

29:11.944 --> 29:13.847
I don't know, man.

29:14.748 --> 29:16.649
I just don't think you guys
are ready for that.

29:18.617 --> 29:21.954
Damn. It's like that?

29:22.955 --> 29:24.323
It's truth.

29:25.692 --> 29:27.426
Your truth.

29:29.261 --> 29:31.930
I got ants in my beer.

29:33.098 --> 29:34.566
That's not gonna taste good.

29:35.702 --> 29:39.605
Not to pry, but you
and James seem...

29:45.043 --> 29:46.646
I don't know...

29:47.012 --> 29:49.281
I thought if instead of
my usual type,

29:49.314 --> 29:50.616
I dated the opposite.

29:52.484 --> 29:55.587
I met James and I thought
we would yin and yang.

29:57.022 --> 29:59.525
But it's been more yin and yawn.

30:02.995 --> 30:05.197
He's a sweet guy, though.

30:05.230 --> 30:07.266
I don't dig sweet.

30:09.101 --> 30:12.037
I think I'm gonna break up with
him when we get back.

30:12.070 --> 30:14.273
Oh, wow.

30:14.306 --> 30:17.576
He's gonna be heartbroken.

30:17.609 --> 30:19.545
He'll live.

30:26.653 --> 30:27.586
Hey!

30:27.619 --> 30:29.421
Check this bad boy out.'s

30:29.455 --> 30:31.190
Can you believe how big he is?

30:32.424 --> 30:34.159
Dinner time!

30:37.596 --> 30:40.432
It's not bad, man, first time,
it's beginner's luck.

30:40.466 --> 30:43.135
Hey, well, I mean, I don't
believe in luck.

30:43.168 --> 30:45.128
So, it's just something
I can do every time we go.

30:45.738 --> 30:47.206
It's a Black River catfish.

30:47.239 --> 30:48.540
It's good stuff.

30:48.574 --> 30:48.974
Oh, thank you.

30:49.007 --> 30:50.108
You're welcome.

30:50.142 --> 30:51.176
Thanks, baby.

30:51.210 --> 30:54.146
Y'all have fun gutting 'em, too.

30:56.081 --> 30:56.749
Hmm.

30:56.783 --> 30:59.284
Mm-mm, you smell like outside.

30:59.318 --> 31:01.553
Well, we are outside.

31:06.458 --> 31:08.227
You really have to do that
right here?

31:08.260 --> 31:09.629
You don't gotta eat it.

31:11.196 --> 31:12.564
We need more firewood.

31:14.099 --> 31:15.367
James will get it.

31:17.804 --> 31:21.073
Yeah, sure, I'll get it.

31:21.641 --> 31:22.809
Alone?

31:22.842 --> 31:24.343
I'll go with you.

31:24.376 --> 31:26.245
I've been sitting too long
anyway.

31:27.579 --> 31:30.182
It's really nice how everyone is
contributing

31:30.215 --> 31:31.383
to dinner.

31:31.416 --> 31:32.484
Fine, I'll cook it.

31:34.253 --> 31:35.621
No, you won't.

31:36.756 --> 31:38.557
Yes, I will.

31:38.590 --> 31:39.835
You probably didn't even bring
any seasonings.

31:39.859 --> 31:41.426
You don't know anything
about cooking.

31:41.460 --> 31:43.262
You're not cooking the fish.

31:43.295 --> 31:44.731
Why? Because you're so good at
it?

31:44.764 --> 31:45.197
Yeah.

31:45.230 --> 31:46.031
But you can't...

31:46.064 --> 31:47.424
And I caught it
and I'm cooking it.

31:48.267 --> 31:49.511
You clearly don't know what
you're doing.

31:49.535 --> 31:50.779
Look... look at how ridiculous...

31:50.803 --> 31:52.672
Okay, you don't even know what
I'm doing.

31:52.705 --> 31:54.172
Neither do you!

31:54.573 --> 31:56.575
I never seen anything like it.

31:56.608 --> 31:58.253
I mean, they can't go
five minutes without going

31:58.277 --> 31:59.646
at each other's necks.

31:59.679 --> 32:01.848
It's like watching two lions
fight over territory.

32:01.881 --> 32:03.482
I should've brought
a first aid kit.

32:03.515 --> 32:05.517
Look, look, if Daniel gets
anywhere near Naomi,

32:05.551 --> 32:07.419
he will end up in the lake.

32:07.452 --> 32:09.187
Didn't think I need it for her.

32:09.488 --> 32:11.390
Right.

32:11.423 --> 32:13.234
You know, I read that leaving
markings for yourself in case

32:13.258 --> 32:16.461
you get lost can save your life.

32:16.495 --> 32:17.462
Nice.

32:17.496 --> 32:19.231
Fun fact.

32:19.666 --> 32:21.333
I caught the fish,
I brought the pan!

32:21.366 --> 32:22.501
I'm cooking it!

32:22.534 --> 32:23.435
I brought the seasoning,
and the sauce,

32:23.468 --> 32:25.103
and my people fry fish
better than yours.

32:25.137 --> 32:26.377
Of course, this is a race thing!

32:26.405 --> 32:27.339
It's a taste thing!

32:27.372 --> 32:28.173
And you don't have any!

32:28.206 --> 32:29.474
Whatever.

32:29.508 --> 32:31.744
- Give me the fish.
- No.

32:31.778 --> 32:32.788
I'm not playin', gringuito!

32:32.812 --> 32:33.746
- Give me the fish!
- No!

32:33.780 --> 32:35.414
Give me the damn fish!

32:38.885 --> 32:41.219
So, Naomi?

32:41.253 --> 32:44.356
Thinking she could be
the one or just a fling?

32:44.791 --> 32:46.325
I know she's the one.

32:57.336 --> 32:59.271
Were you checking me out
last night?

33:00.773 --> 33:02.274
No.

33:08.748 --> 33:09.916
May... maybe we should...

33:09.949 --> 33:10.949
I'm already ahead of you.

33:31.603 --> 33:33.906
- Something in...
- The woods behind.

33:33.940 --> 33:34.941
I tripped and fell.

33:45.952 --> 33:47.219
Nothing.

33:53.592 --> 33:55.862
So, who's cooking?

33:57.562 --> 33:59.398
He is.

34:00.499 --> 34:02.367
She'll season.

34:12.577 --> 34:14.813
That woman hates to compromise.

34:24.056 --> 34:25.757
Good.

34:26.993 --> 34:28.293
Okay.

34:34.299 --> 34:35.434
Mmm.

34:41.406 --> 34:43.676
Oh my God, guys.

34:43.710 --> 34:45.645
This is delicious.

34:47.411 --> 34:50.315
Hmm. You two could open
a restaurant.

34:50.348 --> 34:51.550
Mhmm.

34:51.583 --> 34:52.752
What would we even call it?

34:52.784 --> 34:53.985
Duck.

34:54.020 --> 34:55.987
Oh, so now we're cooking duck,
too?

34:56.022 --> 34:59.025
No, it's what we'd tell to all
our guests

34:59.058 --> 35:00.803
so they'd know to dodge
the pans we'd be throwing

35:00.827 --> 35:01.827
at each other.

35:03.963 --> 35:05.297
Dinner and entertainment.

35:05.330 --> 35:06.598
Bet.

35:18.577 --> 35:20.046
You can try and hide it,
but I know

35:20.079 --> 35:21.814
what's going on here.

35:25.752 --> 35:29.856
You two
are actually getting along.

35:33.926 --> 35:35.828
Well, I'ma go throw up now.

35:35.862 --> 35:36.896
Mhmm.

35:36.929 --> 35:39.364
Well, I think it's nice.

35:39.397 --> 35:40.800
We should celebrate.

35:48.775 --> 35:50.910
This should still
have some left, right?

35:54.881 --> 35:56.883
I'm already high.

35:57.650 --> 35:59.051
Sarah?

35:59.085 --> 36:00.619
What?

36:01.154 --> 36:02.354
Give me that shit.

36:07.425 --> 36:07.894
Lighter?

36:07.927 --> 36:10.062
Oh.

37:30.142 --> 37:34.080
This is exactly what I wanted
this weekend to feel like.

37:36.148 --> 37:39.085
Yeah, this is dope.

37:40.686 --> 37:43.055
And thank you, you guys.

37:43.089 --> 37:45.825
I knew you didn't really hate
each other.

37:51.063 --> 37:52.965
Of course.

37:52.999 --> 37:55.500
Just what we needed.

37:55.533 --> 37:57.103
New beginnings.

38:07.213 --> 38:09.682
Speaking of new beginnings...

38:14.987 --> 38:16.554
What are you doing?

38:16.588 --> 38:18.724
I'm growing a pair.

38:19.491 --> 38:22.895
Naomi, I've never met anybody
who pushes me

38:22.929 --> 38:24.864
the way that you do.

38:24.897 --> 38:27.499
Who makes me want to be the best
version of myself

38:27.532 --> 38:28.701
that I can be.

38:28.734 --> 38:31.170
Oh, my God.

38:31.203 --> 38:34.006
I want to spend the rest of my
life with you.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.508
No, you don't.

38:38.610 --> 38:40.880
Will you marry me?

38:48.888 --> 38:50.222
Daniel.

38:50.256 --> 38:51.256
Daniel!

38:51.991 --> 38:56.762
Babe, I'm still kinda' high
and I'm horny as hell.

38:56.796 --> 38:58.197
How are you not angry right now?

38:58.230 --> 39:00.733
Oh, come on!

39:00.766 --> 39:02.234
You know they don't
belong together.

39:02.268 --> 39:04.036
But his proposal was so sweet.

39:04.070 --> 39:05.838
No, it wasn't. It was stupid.

39:05.871 --> 39:07.206
Well, she didn't have to
do that.

39:07.239 --> 39:08.240
Do what?

39:08.274 --> 39:09.985
If you don't want to marry
someone you say, no.

39:10.009 --> 39:11.711
Not like that.

39:11.744 --> 39:13.980
She didn't have to humiliate him
in front of us.

39:14.013 --> 39:15.247
That's your best friend.

39:15.281 --> 39:16.983
And I told him it was
a dumb idea,

39:17.016 --> 39:18.751
and he didn't listen
to me, so...

39:20.019 --> 39:22.788
You are unbelievable!

39:22.822 --> 39:25.523
You treat other people
so savagely.

39:25.557 --> 39:27.525
I was just telling him
the truth.

39:27.559 --> 39:29.494
I want to quit my job.

39:30.129 --> 39:30.830
You wanna hear the truth?

39:30.863 --> 39:32.865
You want to know how it feels?

39:32.898 --> 39:34.166
You're taking advantage of me.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.101
Come on.

39:35.134 --> 39:38.237
I'm killing myself
to support both of us

39:38.270 --> 39:41.007
and honestly, you're not doing
your part.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.808
I'm working my ass off.

39:42.842 --> 39:44.110
Are you?

39:44.143 --> 39:46.012
'Cause I pay the bills.

39:46.045 --> 39:48.748
I take care of the house,
laundry, dishes.

39:48.781 --> 39:50.192
Yeah, I'm... I'm starting
a business.

39:50.216 --> 39:53.019
That doesn't take five years,
Daniel!

39:53.052 --> 39:54.120
It's a failure.

39:54.153 --> 39:55.755
It's not happening.

40:03.829 --> 40:06.032
What do you want from me?

40:08.667 --> 40:10.069
I want you to support
my decision

40:10.102 --> 40:11.704
to go to nursing school.

40:11.737 --> 40:12.772
We can't afford that.

40:12.805 --> 40:14.173
We can if you get a job.

40:16.008 --> 40:17.977
Are you serious?

40:18.010 --> 40:19.311
I've done my part.

40:19.345 --> 40:21.981
I've held us together,
now it's your turn.

40:28.087 --> 40:29.755
This is bullshit!

40:57.349 --> 40:58.384
What are you doing here?

40:58.417 --> 41:00.019
Jogging.

41:00.820 --> 41:02.655
Anything left in that?

41:24.210 --> 41:27.079
Why would he propose?

41:27.113 --> 41:28.814
So stupid.

41:28.848 --> 41:30.983
I told him not to.

41:31.016 --> 41:33.652
Not surprised.

41:33.686 --> 41:34.930
The hell does that
supposed to mean?

41:34.954 --> 41:36.422
You're a dick.

41:36.455 --> 41:38.290
Oh my God.
Go screw yourself, okay?

41:39.291 --> 41:42.695
Big words coming from
a spoiled man-child

41:42.728 --> 41:44.697
who thinks he's tough,
but really he's just

41:44.730 --> 41:47.199
some puss living off
his wife's salary.

41:49.902 --> 41:51.904
So, you're the reason why Sarah
all of a sudden

41:51.937 --> 41:53.806
wants to blow up
our entire life?

41:53.839 --> 41:56.342
Oh, I'm not the reason,
I'm the realization.

41:58.277 --> 42:00.246
You think you're so smart.

42:00.279 --> 42:02.114
You think you're better
than everyone

42:02.148 --> 42:04.049
'cause you got a bigger mouth.

42:04.083 --> 42:05.184
Oh, I have a big mouth?

42:05.217 --> 42:06.318
Yeah, you do.

42:06.352 --> 42:08.087
When someone actually comes back
at you,

42:08.120 --> 42:11.090
you don't know what to do,
so you just yell louder.

42:12.224 --> 42:14.093
James is a good dude.

42:14.126 --> 42:16.762
He didn't deserve what you did.

42:19.965 --> 42:22.201
And you think you deserve Sarah?

42:24.003 --> 42:26.272
That woman would die for you,

42:26.305 --> 42:28.174
but your head's
so far up your own ass

42:28.207 --> 42:30.209
that all you see
is your own shit.

42:33.946 --> 42:35.948
Hmm, you know it, too.

42:37.917 --> 42:44.089
She is miserable,
because of you.

42:47.459 --> 42:49.261
Get out of my face.

42:49.295 --> 42:51.263
You ain't shit.

42:51.297 --> 42:53.132
I said, get out of my face.

42:53.165 --> 42:54.433
Or what?

42:54.466 --> 42:56.168
The hell you gonna do?

43:03.008 --> 43:05.110
The hell you gonna do?

43:58.564 --> 44:00.165
Sarah?

44:01.467 --> 44:03.802
Hey, James.

44:03.836 --> 44:05.204
You okay?

44:05.237 --> 44:07.006
I thought I heard you crying.

44:07.373 --> 44:09.174
Yeah, I'm fine.

44:10.142 --> 44:11.443
Okay.

44:12.344 --> 44:14.079
Are you okay?

44:15.314 --> 44:16.882
Yeah.

44:56.188 --> 44:57.923
Hey, James?

44:59.958 --> 45:00.592
Yeah?

45:00.626 --> 45:02.328
Have you seen Daniel?

45:04.196 --> 45:06.865
Think I saw him walk by
a minute ago.

45:06.899 --> 45:08.033
Sarah!

45:09.034 --> 45:12.004
Naomi!

45:12.037 --> 45:13.205
Help!

45:13.238 --> 45:15.207
Get off me, get off me!

45:19.178 --> 45:20.012
What happened?

45:20.045 --> 45:22.448
Your tent!
Something's in your tent!

45:22.481 --> 45:23.449
You okay? Something bite you?

45:23.482 --> 45:25.652
I'm fine, I... I didn't see it.

45:25.685 --> 45:28.087
I saw it, okay.
There was a shadow.

45:28.120 --> 45:29.254
Something's in there, man.

45:29.288 --> 45:30.189
Like an animal?

45:30.222 --> 45:32.458
Like a person.

45:32.491 --> 45:34.226
I think it was a woman, man.

45:35.461 --> 45:38.130
Hey! Come out!

45:41.433 --> 45:43.469
Come out now or we're
gonna call the police!

45:50.576 --> 45:52.679
I swear to God something
is in there.

46:02.287 --> 46:04.356
It's your last chance, come on!

46:26.111 --> 46:27.579
It was right behind her.

46:28.648 --> 46:29.982
Well, it's not there now, man.

46:30.015 --> 46:31.226
I... I... look, I swear,
I saw something

46:31.250 --> 46:31.785
right behind her.

46:31.818 --> 46:32.951
It... it was a shadow...

46:32.985 --> 46:34.520
James, just chill!

46:34.553 --> 46:35.487
I'm not crazy, okay!

46:35.521 --> 46:36.656
I saw something in the tent!

46:36.689 --> 46:37.733
There's somebody out here with
us...

46:37.757 --> 46:39.091
Where, dude?

46:39.124 --> 46:40.192
There's no one's out here!

46:40.225 --> 46:41.393
I know what I saw, okay!

46:41.427 --> 46:42.961
I know what I saw.

46:42.995 --> 46:45.097
Sarah, what's he talking about?

46:45.130 --> 46:48.467
I... I don't know.
I never saw anything.

46:49.201 --> 46:50.713
Okay, I know what you guys are
thinking,

46:50.737 --> 46:52.571
but this is not me being scared
of shit, okay!

46:52.604 --> 46:54.239
James, there is no one
here, man!

46:54.273 --> 46:55.450
What, you think I'm making
this up?

46:55.474 --> 46:57.242
You've been afraid since before
we got here!

46:57.276 --> 46:59.011
So kind of, yeah, I do.

46:59.044 --> 47:00.412
Fuck you, Daniel, alright?

47:00.446 --> 47:01.556
With all your macho-bro shit.

47:01.580 --> 47:02.581
We're leaving, right now.

47:02.614 --> 47:03.582
Oh, okay, oh, yeah, yeah.

47:03.615 --> 47:06.251
Where you gonna go uh, without
these, huh?

47:06.285 --> 47:09.421
Daniel, please!
Stop, he's terrified.

47:09.455 --> 47:11.990
No, he's not.
He's pissed that he got dumped

47:12.024 --> 47:13.592
and now he's just
throwing a fit!

47:13.625 --> 47:15.728
Will you please listen
to someone else for once?

47:15.762 --> 47:18.163
No! I'm not driving home
four hours

47:18.197 --> 47:20.532
in the middle of the night
because he's scared!

47:20.566 --> 47:21.668
Whatever, okay.

47:21.701 --> 47:23.168
We leave first thing
in the morning.

47:23.202 --> 47:24.136
I'm fishing.

47:24.169 --> 47:26.205
Daniel, please.

47:27.640 --> 47:29.642
I'm going to bed.

47:29.676 --> 47:31.644
I'm sleeping in the truck.

47:31.678 --> 47:32.578
Are you serious?

47:32.611 --> 47:35.314
I'm dead-ass serious.

47:36.582 --> 47:38.283
Oh, my God. It's pathetic.

47:38.317 --> 47:39.686
Daniel!

47:50.162 --> 47:51.396
Come on, Sarah.

47:52.531 --> 47:53.432
No.

47:53.465 --> 47:54.634
No?

47:54.667 --> 47:57.402
I'm not sleeping in a tent
next to you.

47:58.470 --> 48:00.673
Naomi, do you mind?

48:00.707 --> 48:02.107
Sure.

48:02.140 --> 48:03.408
Oh my God!

48:03.442 --> 48:06.813
You have all lost your freaking
minds!

48:06.846 --> 48:10.650
Okay, fine here, let me do
a huge favor for all of us.

48:10.683 --> 48:16.321
And I will just bounce myself
down all the way here

48:16.355 --> 48:20.292
with the alligators,
and the turtles,

48:20.325 --> 48:22.729
and the frogs that way you never
have to see me

48:22.762 --> 48:23.830
again, alright?

48:23.863 --> 48:25.364
That what you want?

48:25.999 --> 48:29.167
Son of a... Goddamn it!

48:40.178 --> 48:43.716
What if James did see something?

48:43.750 --> 48:45.284
That story you told us.

48:45.317 --> 48:47.252
About the woman with one leg.

48:47.286 --> 48:48.086
You said her name.

48:48.120 --> 48:48.788
She could be here.

48:48.821 --> 48:50.188
She's not real.

48:51.156 --> 48:53.726
But some people can't see her.

48:53.760 --> 48:55.862
And I swear I heard
singing last night.

48:55.895 --> 48:57.462
She's not real, Sarah.

48:57.496 --> 49:00.165
It's a legend
used to scare people.

49:01.567 --> 49:06.405
In the legend, how do people
fight her off?

49:07.807 --> 49:10.075
Fire.

49:14.479 --> 49:16.315
Would you like
me to re-light it?

49:21.253 --> 49:22.855
Thank you.

49:30.863 --> 49:33.432
She can't be real.

50:04.496 --> 50:05.932
Come here.

50:05.965 --> 50:08.400
Hmm? Hmm.

50:17.476 --> 50:18.745
Come, Daniel.

50:28.855 --> 50:30.622
Naomi?

51:24.509 --> 51:26.445
We're gonna get caught.

51:34.386 --> 51:36.455
Will you cut that shit out?
Okay?

51:36.488 --> 51:37.957
I don't...

51:37.990 --> 51:40.325
understand
what you're saying.

51:41.393 --> 51:42.393
This better?

51:55.307 --> 51:57.677
Are you lost?

51:59.679 --> 52:01.580
Are you okay?

52:17.797 --> 52:19.331
What the hell.

53:01.808 --> 53:03.341
Morning.

53:03.375 --> 53:04.342
Morning.

53:04.376 --> 53:05.544
How'd you sleep?

53:05.577 --> 53:06.179
I didn't.

53:06.212 --> 53:08.748
Yeah, that was some night.

53:08.781 --> 53:10.058
Yeah, I don't wanna
talk about it.

53:10.082 --> 53:11.383
Just wanna get out of here.

53:11.884 --> 53:13.552
I'll get Daniel up.

53:17.757 --> 53:22.460
Hey, Daniel,
I think that we should... could...

53:26.732 --> 53:28.466
Daniel?

53:41.446 --> 53:43.381
He's not there.

53:43.950 --> 53:44.951
Are you serious?

53:44.984 --> 53:45.985
Yeah.

53:48.553 --> 53:50.056
Damn.

53:56.128 --> 53:58.898
I just wanna get out of here.

53:58.931 --> 54:00.700
Maybe he's at the lake.

54:01.801 --> 54:03.169
He did say he was going fish.

54:03.202 --> 54:04.569
Right.

54:05.437 --> 54:06.939
I'll go get him.

54:16.115 --> 54:18.050
Oh, hey.

54:18.084 --> 54:19.584
Morning.

54:20.786 --> 54:22.054
Where is everybody?

54:22.088 --> 54:25.423
Uh, James went to get Daniel
from the lake.

54:25.457 --> 54:26.759
Oh.

54:33.099 --> 54:34.066
Hear, let me help you...

54:34.100 --> 54:35.668
I got it.

54:39.171 --> 54:40.806
My bad.

54:45.778 --> 54:46.913
Naomi, I'm sorry that...

54:46.946 --> 54:48.513
Girl, stop.

54:48.546 --> 54:50.506
You are the last thing that
needs to be appolog...

54:54.887 --> 54:56.088
What is it?

54:59.725 --> 55:00.826
Naomi.

55:11.503 --> 55:13.438
I need to pee.

55:32.124 --> 55:33.859
Daniel?

55:34.760 --> 55:37.096
Daniel, come on now,
we don't have time for this.

55:38.264 --> 55:40.498
Daniel!

55:40.532 --> 55:42.467
I get the point, okay, let's go!

55:46.872 --> 55:48.774
Come on, Daniel, please.

55:49.775 --> 55:50.910
Hell.

55:55.281 --> 55:57.549
He wasn't there.

56:04.290 --> 56:06.192
Where... where's Naomi?

56:26.145 --> 56:27.980
This is unbelievable.

56:28.014 --> 56:29.915
Where the hell are they?

56:35.154 --> 56:37.522
What did you see last night?

56:40.226 --> 56:41.794
I don't know.

56:41.827 --> 56:43.763
But there was something
out there.

56:45.898 --> 56:48.968
I thought I felt something.

56:49.001 --> 56:51.037
In the tent with me.

56:52.705 --> 56:53.839
You believe me?

56:53.873 --> 56:55.207
I don't know.

56:55.241 --> 56:56.842
But I keep thinking about
that woman

56:56.876 --> 56:57.843
Naomi told us about.

56:57.877 --> 56:59.245
The Pata-something.

56:59.278 --> 57:01.747
She said,
not everyone can see her.

57:01.781 --> 57:03.716
What if she was coming after me?

57:03.749 --> 57:05.785
You know what you're saying?

57:07.153 --> 57:08.754
She only appears
when someone's cheating

57:08.788 --> 57:10.189
on their partner.

57:14.393 --> 57:16.195
Wait.

57:16.228 --> 57:20.232
Daniel and Naomi came back
together last night.

57:20.266 --> 57:22.301
No, no, they'd never do that.

57:22.334 --> 57:24.103
But they did came back together.

57:24.136 --> 57:25.838
That's not what they were doing.

57:25.871 --> 57:28.140
Look,
I saw something behind you.

57:28.174 --> 57:29.075
You couldn't see it.

57:29.108 --> 57:30.708
And they both were gone
when it happened.

57:31.110 --> 57:32.645
Shouldn't have said anything.

57:32.678 --> 57:33.345
You think it's impossible?

57:33.379 --> 57:34.814
I'm not talking about this!

57:35.147 --> 57:36.115
But Sarah,
so you're gonna act like

57:36.148 --> 57:37.325
you didn't see anything
happening between them

57:37.349 --> 57:38.517
all weekend?

57:38.551 --> 57:41.954
Look, I know you're upset
because Naomi humiliated you

57:41.987 --> 57:43.165
in front of us,
and you're looking

57:43.189 --> 57:44.790
for any reason to get back
at her,

57:44.824 --> 57:46.624
but I think it's really shitty
of you

57:46.659 --> 57:49.161
to even remotely assume that
that's what happened.

57:50.996 --> 57:52.998
Then, where are they?

57:54.900 --> 57:56.635
Hmm?

57:56.669 --> 57:58.771
It doesn't take an hour to pee.

57:59.604 --> 58:01.974
He may be brutish sometimes, but
my husband

58:02.007 --> 58:03.709
would never cheat on me.

58:06.946 --> 58:08.914
I found Daniel, he's hurt badly.

58:08.948 --> 58:09.648
Hurt?

58:09.682 --> 58:10.416
Something attacked him!

58:10.449 --> 58:11.684
Oh, my God!

58:11.717 --> 58:13.652
Come on!

58:13.686 --> 58:14.453
Wait!

58:14.487 --> 58:15.855
Daniel's hatchet,
did he take it?

58:15.888 --> 58:16.789
We don't have enough time!

58:16.822 --> 58:19.291
We need something
to protect ourselves!

58:49.321 --> 58:51.957
How did he get
all the way out here?

58:51.991 --> 58:53.959
Naomi?

58:53.993 --> 58:55.928
Naomi, this doesn't make
any sense.

58:56.729 --> 58:59.031
How did you find him
all the way out here?

58:59.932 --> 59:01.433
One thing makes sense.

59:31.030 --> 59:31.497
Oh.

59:31.530 --> 59:32.398
Oh, are you okay?

59:32.431 --> 59:33.742
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm good.
I'm good.

59:33.766 --> 59:34.333
Okay.

59:34.366 --> 59:36.001
Oh my gosh.

59:37.803 --> 59:39.381
Do... do you have any idea
where he could be?

59:39.405 --> 59:41.082
Isn't there some kind of
an activity that you guys

59:41.106 --> 59:42.906
should know like where each
other are, like...

01:00:07.466 --> 01:00:08.968
This is a goose chase.

01:00:09.902 --> 01:00:12.871
What type of game you
and Daniel playing, huh?

01:00:17.943 --> 01:00:19.078
Or is this a joke?

01:00:19.111 --> 01:00:21.380
You guys working together
to get us back or something?

01:00:22.081 --> 01:00:25.017
Or did you guys hook up
last night,

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:26.330
and you're trying
to cover it up?

01:00:30.389 --> 01:00:32.825
So, now's the time that
you say nothing?

01:00:33.325 --> 01:00:34.960
That sounds guilty to me.

01:00:36.395 --> 01:00:39.164
What's going on, Naomi? Where's
Daniel?

01:00:39.198 --> 01:00:40.899
No, look, we're not doing this.

01:00:40.933 --> 01:00:42.835
They did something, Sarah, okay?

01:00:42.868 --> 01:00:44.112
And now they're playing games
with us.

01:00:44.136 --> 01:00:45.513
They fucked up, now they're
trying to hide it

01:00:45.537 --> 01:00:47.039
with all this bullshit, okay?

01:00:47.072 --> 01:00:48.116
Like, I don't care
what you guys think,

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.142
there is something out here
chasing us, alright?

01:00:50.175 --> 01:00:51.286
Like so, I'm gonna take my keys

01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:52.870
and I'm gonna get the fuck outta
here...

01:00:53.112 --> 01:00:55.381
Oh my God!

01:00:55.414 --> 01:00:57.816
That was uncalled...

01:01:07.126 --> 01:01:08.127
Where'd she go?

01:01:10.029 --> 01:01:12.231
Okay, to hell with this,
I'm out.

01:01:12.264 --> 01:01:14.533
Wait, what about Daniel?

01:01:14.566 --> 01:01:17.503
I'm sorry, Sarah,
but we have to go right now.

01:01:17.536 --> 01:01:19.505
You would just leave
your best friend out here?

01:01:19.538 --> 01:01:21.874
We don't know where he is, we're
lost!

01:01:21.907 --> 01:01:24.943
Okay, what if the story that
she said is true,

01:01:24.977 --> 01:01:27.246
and the Patasola is out here
with us.

01:01:27.279 --> 01:01:30.883
Then, according to her story,
he's already dead.

01:01:33.319 --> 01:01:35.988
I can't believe that.

01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:37.456
Come on, we gotta get help.

01:01:37.489 --> 01:01:40.025
I have to find him.

01:01:40.059 --> 01:01:40.459
Daniel!

01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:41.860
Sarah!

01:01:41.894 --> 01:01:42.928
Daniel!

01:01:42.961 --> 01:01:45.064
Sarah.

01:01:45.097 --> 01:01:46.332
Daniel!

01:01:50.602 --> 01:01:52.004
Daniel!

01:01:53.172 --> 01:01:57.076
He's fine, he's... he's fine.

01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:58.109
We're all fine.

01:02:00.446 --> 01:02:02.181
Daniel?

01:02:04.316 --> 01:02:05.584
Babe!

01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:31.510
No!

01:02:31.543 --> 01:02:32.211
Hey!

01:02:32.244 --> 01:02:34.012
Sarah!

01:03:26.699 --> 01:03:28.367
Sarah?

01:03:29.401 --> 01:03:31.270
Daniel?

01:03:31.303 --> 01:03:32.938
Sarah?

01:03:34.506 --> 01:03:36.542
I'll be in the truck.

01:03:42.114 --> 01:03:43.582
Naomi?

01:03:45.584 --> 01:03:47.519
Naomi?

01:03:53.459 --> 01:03:54.526
Naomi!

01:03:56.595 --> 01:03:59.398
Screw you, screw you!

01:03:59.431 --> 01:04:01.233
Come find me.

01:04:30.529 --> 01:04:32.130
Stop... stop, please.

01:04:33.131 --> 01:04:34.600
Please stop, please.

01:04:36.602 --> 01:04:37.737
Stop, please! Stop!

01:04:40.239 --> 01:04:42.675
I said... I said stop! Stop!

01:05:23.615 --> 01:05:26.051
This is... what's going-
It's... it's...

01:05:43.803 --> 01:05:45.103
Hello?

01:05:46.839 --> 01:05:47.839
Get away!

01:05:47.907 --> 01:05:48.875
What's going on?

01:05:48.908 --> 01:05:50.485
You have to stand up,
we have to go right now.

01:05:50.509 --> 01:05:51.310
What's happening?

01:05:51.343 --> 01:05:53.178
- She's here, get your light.
- Hmm?

01:05:53.211 --> 01:05:54.446
Get your light.

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.316
James, James, James!

01:05:58.751 --> 01:06:00.185
Naomi?

01:06:00.218 --> 01:06:02.287
Naomi.

01:06:02.321 --> 01:06:05.190
- Naomi, say something.
- Naomi, come on!

01:06:05.223 --> 01:06:06.659
Naomi?

01:06:08.293 --> 01:06:09.127
- Daniel!
- Listen, Sarah! Wait.

01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:11.263
- No! No, Daniel!
- Sarah, look at his...

01:06:11.296 --> 01:06:12.440
look his at eyes,
look at his eyes!

01:06:12.464 --> 01:06:13.298
Look at his body.

01:06:13.332 --> 01:06:16.435
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

01:06:16.468 --> 01:06:18.203
I don't know, look at his body,
look at him.

01:06:18.236 --> 01:06:19.839
What... what are they doing?

01:06:19.872 --> 01:06:21.106
What are they doing?

01:06:22.174 --> 01:06:24.711
Daniel, can you hear me?

01:06:24.744 --> 01:06:26.345
Daniel, wake up.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.548
- No!
- Wait, Sarah.

01:06:29.581 --> 01:06:30.883
- No!
- Sarah, come on.

01:06:30.917 --> 01:06:32.217
It's not true, no!

01:06:35.253 --> 01:06:37.165
That's what she's doing, Sarah.
She's got them both.

01:06:37.189 --> 01:06:38.357
Daniel.

01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:39.257
Daniel.

01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:41.861
I'm so sorry, babe.

01:06:41.894 --> 01:06:43.428
I didn't mean it, I promise.

01:06:43.462 --> 01:06:46.264
It was just one moment,
I'm so sorry.

01:06:46.298 --> 01:06:47.900
I'm so sorry, please forgive me.

01:06:47.934 --> 01:06:51.169
I'm so sorry, I... I love you.

01:06:51.203 --> 01:06:52.105
I love you, too.

01:06:52.137 --> 01:06:53.682
I'm so sorry,
but I... I didn't mean it.

01:06:53.706 --> 01:06:56.174
It was just...
it was just a moment.

01:06:56.208 --> 01:06:57.518
That is not your husband.
No, that is not...

01:06:57.542 --> 01:06:59.478
that's is not...
that's not your husband.

01:06:59.511 --> 01:07:00.512
Daniel I love you too.

01:07:00.545 --> 01:07:01.724
That's not him,
that's not your husband!

01:07:01.748 --> 01:07:02.547
James! I love you, too.

01:07:02.581 --> 01:07:04.516
Don't listen to him. He's lying!

01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:05.584
- No!
- Sarah, it's her!

01:07:05.617 --> 01:07:06.618
I'm so...

01:07:26.706 --> 01:07:27.840
Sarah, don't!

01:07:31.576 --> 01:07:32.945
It's what she wants.

01:07:49.962 --> 01:07:53.398
Sarah? Sarah?

01:08:09.849 --> 01:08:11.349
Can you see her now?

01:08:12.584 --> 01:08:13.585
Yes.

01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:37.710
Sarah!

01:08:53.725 --> 01:08:55.292
Come on, run!

01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:00.032
Let's go.

01:09:05.904 --> 01:09:06.671
What do we do?

01:09:06.706 --> 01:09:08.741
We gotta get back to the truck.

01:09:11.743 --> 01:09:12.745
That can't be good.

01:09:14.881 --> 01:09:16.048
Faster, come on!

01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:17.082
Come on!

01:09:24.991 --> 01:09:26.424
We're not gonna make it.

01:09:26.457 --> 01:09:27.325
We're gonna make it!

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:28.627
We're too far.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.533
Is that...

01:09:35.567 --> 01:09:36.969
Her true form.

01:09:40.673 --> 01:09:41.674
James.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.454
Shit.

01:11:00.186 --> 01:11:01.988
Down here.

01:11:09.829 --> 01:11:10.997
Where is she?

01:11:12.999 --> 01:11:15.668
Why, Daniel, why?

01:11:39.825 --> 01:11:42.028
Naomi said, you can fight her
with fire.

01:11:42.995 --> 01:11:44.562
Okay, I hear you.

01:11:44.596 --> 01:11:46.032
Got anything else?

01:11:46.065 --> 01:11:47.199
Yeah.

01:11:53.205 --> 01:11:54.907
Yeah. Let's get this bitch.

01:12:21.033 --> 01:12:22.835
The highway.

01:12:22.868 --> 01:12:24.536
We have to get to it.

01:12:24.569 --> 01:12:25.838
How?

01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:32.211
You can make it.

01:12:32.244 --> 01:12:32.645
What?

01:12:32.678 --> 01:12:33.545
You can make it.

01:12:33.578 --> 01:12:34.413
No!

01:12:34.447 --> 01:12:35.589
- Just run as fast as you can.
- No, no!

01:12:35.613 --> 01:12:37.216
You know you can do it.

01:12:37.249 --> 01:12:41.087
Sarah, don't look back.

01:12:43.689 --> 01:12:45.691
What are you doing?

01:12:45.725 --> 01:12:47.960
I'm growing a pair.

01:12:49.328 --> 01:12:52.231
Hey, hey!

01:12:52.264 --> 01:12:54.166
Hey, hey!

01:13:16.188 --> 01:13:19.925
Hey, hey!

01:13:23.929 --> 01:13:28.300
Oh, no.

01:13:29.268 --> 01:13:30.736
Hey!

01:15:19.044 --> 01:15:22.681
I forgive you, Daniel.

01:15:22.715 --> 01:15:23.715
I forgive you.

01:15:55.814 --> 01:15:57.716
Mateo.

01:16:18.871 --> 01:16:19.905
James!

01:16:35.354 --> 01:16:37.256
Hey!

01:18:17.022 --> 01:18:19.124
Are you... are you okay?

01:18:19.158 --> 01:18:22.261
Yeah, I'm alive, you?

01:18:22.294 --> 01:18:23.495
Alive.

01:18:41.347 --> 01:18:42.981
I saw that flash.

01:18:43.015 --> 01:18:44.416
What the hell happened?

01:18:47.419 --> 01:18:49.121
We need to file an IR.
