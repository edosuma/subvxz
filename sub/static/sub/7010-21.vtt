13:20.674 --> 13:23.301
YOU KNOW, JACKIE, YOU BUYING
ME BOOTS IS JUST WRONG.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.970
YOU SHOULD'VE LET ME
SHOPLIFT THEM.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.014
NO, HYDE. I WANT YOU
TO HAVE THEM.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.724
BESIDES,
I'M SAVING A FORTUNE

13:29.767 --> 13:33.603
NOW THAT I DON'T HAVE TO FEED
AND CLOTHE MICHAEL.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.230
WELL, IF YOU INSIST.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.648
I DO.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.358
SO I WAS THINKING
TOMORROW NIGHT,

13:38.400 --> 13:40.109
WE SHOULD,
YOU KNOW...

13:40.152 --> 13:43.029
WHOA, OKAY. ALL RIGHT NOW,
COME ON, JACKIE.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.698
THIS WAS A ONE TIME ONLY
THING, ALL RIGHT?

13:45.741 --> 13:47.408
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BRIBE
ME WITH THESE BOOTS, MAN,

13:47.451 --> 13:49.327
YOU CAN JUST TAKE THEM BACK.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.120
I SEE.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.415
OH, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW, CRY?

13:56.377 --> 13:59.295
OH, MAN, YOU'RE CRYING.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.464
HEY, JACKIE...

14:01.507 --> 14:03.091
COME ON, MAN.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.510
IT'S GONNA BE FINE, OKAY?
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.513
THIS WHOLE THING IS
GONNA BE FINE, ALL RIGHT?

14:11.725 --> 14:13.059
NO. NO!

14:13.102 --> 14:15.395
BAD JACKIE!

14:15.437 --> 14:17.397
BUT, HYDE, I THOUGHT
WE AGREED

14:17.439 --> 14:20.441
THAT YOU WERE ALONE
AND I WAS ALONE...

14:22.361 --> 14:24.153
JACKIE, I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU
OUT HERE, ALL RIGHT?

14:24.196 --> 14:25.738
SO JUST LISTEN TO ME.

14:25.781 --> 14:28.283
YOU GOTTA REALIZE THAT YOU
CAN DO BETTER THAN KELSO.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.618
BUT WHAT IF I NEVER FIND
ANYBODY ELSE?

14:30.661 --> 14:33.663
OH, YOU WILL, MAN.
YOU'LL FIND SOMEBODY GREAT.

14:33.706 --> 14:38.251
YOU SEE, I, MYSELF,
DON'T LIKE YOU.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.087
I FIND YOU ABRASIVE.

14:41.130 --> 14:45.967
BUT IF I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
AND I HAD NEVER TALKED TO YOU,

14:46.010 --> 14:49.095
I'D THINK YOU WERE TOTALLY HOT.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.558
THANK YOU, HYDE.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.519
ANYTHING FOR YOU, DOLL.

15:00.107 --> 15:04.235
PEARL, HONEY,
PLEASE COME OUT.

15:05.613 --> 15:11.242
OH! LAURIE, SHE KINDA LIKES
YOU. DO SOMETHING.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.494
AUNT PEARL!

15:13.537 --> 15:15.330
WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT,
AND YOU CAN SHOW ME

15:15.372 --> 15:18.207
YOUR DAMN SCRAPBOOKS AGAIN?

15:18.250 --> 15:19.834
EVERY TIME
YOU PEOPLE COME,

15:19.877 --> 15:21.920
I GOTTA GET DRESSED
AND PUT MY TEETH IN.

15:21.962 --> 15:25.173
AND YOU'RE NOT WORTH IT,
SO GET LOST!

15:29.219 --> 15:31.721
NOW CAN WE GO?

15:31.764 --> 15:34.098
NO. AHEM.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.685
OKAY, FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GIVE UP.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.395
LET'S JUST GO.

15:39.438 --> 15:43.942
I JUST HOPE WHEN I GET OLD,
SOMEONE COMES TO VISIT ME.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.945
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, MOM.
ERIC WILL COME.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.657
WELL, I'M GONNA GO WARM
THE CAR UP.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.283
NO, LAURIE.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.785
THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO YOUR MOTHER.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.454
SO SIT DOWN.

15:57.081 --> 16:00.124
COME ON, PEARL.
THERE'S A BUCKS GAME ON.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.418
THE BUCKS, HUH?!

16:03.337 --> 16:05.922
OH-HO!

16:09.176 --> 16:12.095
WELL, YOU KNOW, SEE?

16:12.137 --> 16:14.222
THIS IS NICE.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.974
THE ONLY THING
THAT KEEPS ME ALIVE

16:16.016 --> 16:19.686
IS WATCHING THE BUCKS LOSE.
PFFT!

16:23.857 --> 16:26.776
GO BUCKS.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.862
MICHAEL, NO. I DON'T
WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.280
NO. YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.949
OKAY? BECAUSE WORDS
DON'T DO IT.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.575
THAT'S WHY I WROTE

I DON'T LOVE YOU.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.429
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:36.472 --> 17:38.139
NOTHING.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.141
NOTHING AT ALL.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.477
THANK YOU, HYDE,
FOR TONIGHT.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.854
IT WAS VERY SPECIAL.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.322
OHH!
AIEE.

17:55.949 --> 17:58.618
ISN'T SHE NICE?

17:58.660 --> 18:02.789
HEY, FELLAS, YOU
LIKE MY NEW BOOTS?

18:07.753 --> 18:10.088
SO, THEN ERIC
SAYS TO DONNA,

18:10.130 --> 18:11.589
"I CANNOT GO OUT WITH YOU,

18:11.632 --> 18:13.216
BECAUSE I'M GOING OUT
WITH THE GUYS."

18:13.258 --> 18:16.803
OH, JEEZ.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.014
WHAT? I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

18:20.057 --> 18:23.851
NO. WHAT'S HIS NAME'S RIGHT.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.270
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
I DID ANYTHING WRONG.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.647
I'M NOT GOING TO
APOLOGIZE TO DONNA.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.066
OH, YEAH?

18:31.652 --> 18:33.402
WHAT? WHY?

18:33.445 --> 18:34.821
HERE'S THE THING.

18:34.863 --> 18:37.698
YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT YOU'RE
GOOD ENOUGH FOR DONNA.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.326
AND YOU'RE NOT.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.371
YES, I AM.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.997
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.791
JUST LIKE I'M NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOUR MOTHER.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.501
OKAY, WELL...

18:48.544 --> 18:51.629
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.840
HEY, WATCH IT. I'M TRYING TO
HELP YOU OUT HERE.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.424
I'M SORRY. YES, SIR.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.009
LOOK, DO YOU REALLY
THINK I WANTED TO SPEND

18:57.052 --> 18:58.845
THE WHOLE DAMN DAY
SITTING IN A ROOM

18:58.887 --> 19:03.099
WITH A WOMAN WHO HATES THE
BUCKS AND SMELLS LIKE CABBAGE?

19:03.142 --> 19:04.851
WELL, I DIDN'T.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.728
BUT THAT'S THE PRICE
YOU PAY, SON.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.149
NOW, YOU GO CALL DONNA
BEFORE SHE REALIZES

19:11.191 --> 19:13.734
HOW MUCH BETTER OFF
SHE IS WITHOUT YOU.

19:15.195 --> 19:17.155
GO ON NOW. GO!

19:17.197 --> 19:20.575
GO! YOU HEARD HIM, GO!

19:21.076 --> 19:22.535
BUT WHAT ABOUT...

19:22.578 --> 19:25.580
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
MAKE THE CALL, LITTLE MAN.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.381
LISTEN, DONNA...

19:35.424 --> 19:36.716
NO. WAIT.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.468
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT...
YOU KNOW...

19:39.511 --> 19:41.304
WHAT HAPPENED.

19:41.346 --> 19:44.390
AND I REALIZE
I MAY HAVE OVERREACTED.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.225
IT'S JUST THAT I'M
A LITTLE VULNERABLE NOW

19:46.268 --> 19:50.146
THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS... MATURED.

19:51.481 --> 19:55.109
DONNA, NO APOLOGY
NECESSARY.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.196
I WELCOME YOUR INSANE
BEHAVIOR AND CRITICISM.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.368
DON'T BE A JERK, ERIC.

20:04.411 --> 20:07.622
NO. NO. UH, AHEM, I'M
ACTUALLY... I'M BEING SERIOUS.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.416
I'M WILLING TO DO...

20:10.459 --> 20:13.377
WHATEVER IT TAKES
FOR US TO BE TOGETHER.

20:14.087 --> 20:16.380
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.758
IT'S WORTH IT.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.929
WELL... THANK YOU.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.600
SO, UH,
FOR FUTURE REFERENCE,

20:27.643 --> 20:30.645
DO I HAVE TO ASK YOU,
UH, BEFORE I GO OUT

20:30.687 --> 20:33.397
WITH MY FRIENDS?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.483
NO.

20:35.525 --> 20:40.029
UH... YES.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.531
SOMETIMES.

20:42.574 --> 20:46.744
SO, UH, HOW WILL I
KNOW WHICH TIMES?

20:46.787 --> 20:49.956
WELL, YOU'LL KNOW AFTERWARDS
WHEN I GET MAD.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.502
OKAY.
YEAH.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.754
UH, IS THERE,
YOU KNOW,

20:56.797 --> 21:00.591
MAYBE A BETTER
SYSTEM THAN THAT?

21:00.634 --> 21:03.761
NO. I REALLY CAN'T
THINK OF ONE. NO.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.973
OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.183
I'M REALLY SORRY.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.644
ME, TOO.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.772
SO, UH, I BLEW OFF
THE GUYS TONIGHT

21:14.815 --> 21:16.399
TO HANG OUT
WITH YOU.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.567
SO MY CALENDAR
IS WIDE OPEN.

21:18.610 --> 21:22.488
I'M... I'M HERE
FOR YOU, DONNA.

21:22.531 --> 21:26.284
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.
I'M HANGING OUT WITH JACKIE.

21:26.326 --> 21:29.161
YOU COULD COME IF YOU WANT.

21:31.164 --> 21:42.133
THAT'S REALLY NOT FUNNY.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.884
SO, AUNT PE...

21:43.927 --> 21:46.012
SHH!

21:46.054 --> 21:49.598
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
CARSEY-WERNER PRODUCTIONS
AND FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY

22:03.864 --> 22:05.281
I WAS WONDERING...

22:05.324 --> 22:07.742
SHH!
OKAY.
