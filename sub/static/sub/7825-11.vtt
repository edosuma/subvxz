01:19.730 --> 01:21.400
<i>It's a breakthrough product,
Sir,</i>

01:21.460 --> 01:24.370
scientifically formulated to
rinse clean with no oily
deposits.

01:24.430 --> 01:25.500
Hot dog.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.490
And it's mild enough
to use every day.

01:27.570 --> 01:30.170
Isn't life grand?

01:32.400 --> 01:33.400
What's wrong, Sir?

01:33.470 --> 01:34.710
Did I get some
in your eyes?

01:34.770 --> 01:36.200
The shampoo specifically said,
"no more tears."

01:36.280 --> 01:37.610
A lovely promise

01:37.680 --> 01:40.450
but one beyond the powers
of a mere shampoo.

01:40.510 --> 01:42.840
Sir, I feel there's something
you're not telling me.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.390
Perhaps you'd feel more
comfortable talking to
Snappy the Alligator.

01:45.450 --> 01:46.390
Maybe.

01:46.450 --> 01:47.860
Hello, Mr. Burns.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.660
Snappy,
You know it's hard
to imagine

01:49.720 --> 01:53.130
but I was once a barefoot boy
with cheek of tan.

01:53.190 --> 01:54.130
I dreamed

01:54.190 --> 01:55.550
of grand slam home runs

01:55.630 --> 01:59.000
and wiping out nations
with the stroke of a pen.

01:59.060 --> 01:59.960
There's still time for
all those things, Sir. .

02:00.030 --> 02:00.970
Is there?

02:01.030 --> 02:02.430
Controlled nuclear fission

02:02.500 --> 02:04.410
is a demanding mistress, Snappy.

02:04.470 --> 02:06.270
So you feel resentful
towards the plant?

02:06.340 --> 02:07.680
Yes, exactly!

02:07.740 --> 02:12.180
You know, maybe it's time
I sold the old girl.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.300
( <i>gasps )</i>

02:13.380 --> 02:14.580

02:14.650 --> 02:17.250
Mmm!... hmm?!

02:17.320 --> 02:19.020
D-ohhh!

02:19.080 --> 02:20.850
Ohh, what do they want?

02:20.920 --> 02:23.220
Maybe a nap
will boost my spirits.

02:23.290 --> 02:26.130
I'll get that whale song
cassette you like, Sir.

02:26.190 --> 02:27.530
Oh, it's not fair!

02:27.590 --> 02:28.850
( <i>crying )</i>

02:28.930 --> 02:30.570
I know how you feel,
Simpson.

02:30.630 --> 02:32.930
I've never seen Mr. Burns
so depressed.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.340
I know people think because he's
rich and powerful and cruel

02:36.400 --> 02:37.370
he doesn't have feelings
like other men,

02:37.440 --> 02:39.370
but he does.

02:39.440 --> 02:43.110
And you know what?
I bet he wouldn't sell
the plant for $100 million.

02:43.180 --> 02:44.950
Ooh, that's a lot of money.

02:45.010 --> 02:46.510
D-ohhh!

02:46.580 --> 02:48.250
Uh... Mr. Smithers,

02:48.310 --> 02:50.380
do you have change
for a dollar?

02:50.450 --> 02:51.690
Good, good--

try to eat something.

02:53.350 --> 02:54.260
( <i>ringing )</i>

02:54.320 --> 02:55.590
Homer Simpson here.

02:55.650 --> 02:57.220
Homer, it's your stockbroker.

02:57.290 --> 02:58.990
Your stock in the power plant

02:59.060 --> 03:01.730
just went <i>up for the first time
in ten years.</i>

03:01.790 --> 03:02.790
I own stock?

03:02.860 --> 03:04.300
Yes, all the employees got some

03:04.360 --> 03:07.660
in exchange for waiving
certain constitutional rights.

03:07.730 --> 03:09.560
So, how much did it go up?

03:09.640 --> 03:11.010
Wait a minute,
let's not do that yet.

03:11.070 --> 03:12.770
The book says we have
to make a little small talk

03:12.840 --> 03:14.180
before you get down to business.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.340
- Everybody alive?
- Yeah.

03:15.410 --> 03:16.580
- Like any sports?
- Sure.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.050
- Ever go dancing?
- Not anymore.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.210
We should
get together sometime.
That'd be great.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.480
Ah there, now we
trust each other.

03:20.550 --> 03:22.580
Well... how are <i>you?</i>

03:22.650 --> 03:23.550
( <i>hacking )</i>

03:23.620 --> 03:24.990
Near death!

03:25.050 --> 03:28.520
I'm renewing my notary license
on a weekly basis.

03:28.590 --> 03:29.590
Uh-huh, so what's
my stock up to?

03:29.660 --> 03:32.590
Let me punch that up
on the computer.

03:32.660 --> 03:35.200
Uh... 25¢ a share.

03:35.260 --> 03:36.600
<i>What should I do?</i>

03:36.660 --> 03:39.570
Let me put it this way--
you'll get $25 if you sell now.

03:39.630 --> 03:40.740
Sell! Sell! Sell!

03:40.800 --> 03:42.100
Whoo-hoo!

03:42.170 --> 03:46.980

Aunt Patty says our stock
is skyrocketing.

Unconfirmed takeover rumors

Hey, Homer.

04:54.870 --> 04:56.000
Want a Duff?

04:56.070 --> 04:57.740
No, I'd like a bottle

04:57.810 --> 05:00.380
of Henry K. Duff's
Private Reserve.

there's no refund.

05:05.850 --> 05:07.290
For your information

05:07.350 --> 05:11.150
I just made a cool $25
playing the market.

05:11.220 --> 05:12.420
Buy low,
sell high--

05:12.490 --> 05:13.690
that's my motto.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.730
I may just quit my job
at the power plant

05:15.790 --> 05:17.390
and become a full-time

05:17.460 --> 05:21.190

My English is not perfect,
but I have to tell you

05:27.840 --> 05:29.810
your beer
is like swill to us.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.710
Do I have that right?
I'm saying that only a swine
would drink this beer.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.180
Thank you, anyway.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.450
Hey, you guys aren't
from around here, are you?

05:36.520 --> 05:38.120
Nein. We are from Germany.

05:38.180 --> 05:40.680
He is from the east;
I am from the west.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.180
I had a big company,
and he had a big company.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.130
Now we have
a <i>very big company.</i>

05:45.190 --> 05:46.660
We are interested in
buying the power plant.

05:46.730 --> 05:48.760
Do you think your owner
would ever sell it?

05:48.830 --> 05:51.300
Well, I happen to know
that he won't sell it

05:51.360 --> 05:53.360
for less than
$100,000,000.

05:53.430 --> 05:55.070

million?

vier, funf...</i>

05:56.940 --> 05:58.340
Oh, don't worry.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.330
We'll still have enough left
to buy the Cleveland Browns.

06:01.410 --> 06:03.240
It's the miracle

06:03.310 --> 06:04.910
we've been waiting for.

06:04.980 --> 06:06.950
What are we gonna
spend it on?

06:07.010 --> 06:10.890
Homer's probably buying
some magic beans with it
right now.

06:10.950 --> 06:12.690
We'll have
a savings account.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.220
We've never had one.

06:14.290 --> 06:18.830
Kids, I think everything is
going to be okay from now on.

Hey, hey!

Oh, Homer!

You heard?

06:23.060 --> 06:24.000
We heard.

06:24.060 --> 06:25.420
Isn't it wonderful?

06:25.500 --> 06:27.970
We have some great plans
for that money.

06:28.030 --> 06:31.430
Well, I'm afraid I had
some great plans too.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.430
What do you mean?

06:32.500 --> 06:33.760
I spent it on beer.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.110
Surprise, surprise.

06:36.170 --> 06:40.170
You spent $5,200 on beer?!

06:40.250 --> 06:41.720
$5,200?

06:41.780 --> 06:43.890
What are you talking about?

06:43.950 --> 06:44.950
What?

06:46.950 --> 06:48.290
( <i>screams )</i>

06:48.350 --> 06:51.780
I sold it all for 25 bucks!

06:53.160 --> 06:54.360
Oww!
Come on,
everybody.

06:54.430 --> 06:55.530
It makes you feel better.

07:01.970 --> 07:03.300
Hey, Homer.

07:03.370 --> 07:05.870
Did you buy this car
with your stock money?

07:05.940 --> 07:08.180
Sure did, and
the great thing about it

07:08.240 --> 07:09.780
is everybody got rich.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.250
For once, all us working
stiffs got a break.

07:12.310 --> 07:13.110

07:19.650 --> 07:21.260
Wait till you see Lenny.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.960
He just got back from
the plastic surgeon.

07:24.020 --> 07:26.280
Sheesh, Lenny, looks like you
got the works.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.660
It started as an eye tuck,
but the stock kept goin' up..

07:29.730 --> 07:30.630
Come here.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.000
Mr. Burns is on TV.

07:33.070 --> 07:34.140
Mr. Burns?

07:34.200 --> 07:35.500
Here, Mr. Burns.

07:35.570 --> 07:36.500
Over here.

07:36.570 --> 07:37.840
Mr. Burns?

07:37.900 --> 07:39.760
Mr. Burns, we've heard that
a German consortium

07:39.840 --> 07:41.280
has offered to
purchase the plant.

07:41.340 --> 07:43.080
Any comments?

07:43.140 --> 07:45.710
You'll see the
Statue of Liberty
will wear <i>lederhosen</i>

07:45.780 --> 07:47.450
before Germans
running my plant!

07:47.510 --> 07:49.710
Well then, Sir,
why are you meeting
with them?

07:49.780 --> 07:53.390
So I can look Uncle Fritz
square in the monocle

07:53.450 --> 07:54.760
and say, <i>"nein!"</i>

07:56.760 --> 07:59.330
( <i>speaking German )</i>

07:59.390 --> 08:01.960
You never cease
to amaze me, Sir.

08:12.470 --> 08:13.640
Hmm?

08:13.710 --> 08:14.640
Hmm...

08:14.710 --> 08:15.880
Whoo-hoo!

08:15.940 --> 08:17.180
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

08:17.240 --> 08:18.400
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

08:18.480 --> 08:19.680
( <i>clears throat )</i>

08:19.750 --> 08:21.920
I grudgingly accept.

08:21.980 --> 08:25.090
( <i>playing German polka music)</i>

08:29.050 --> 08:30.850
Now, don't worry.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.390
I think that you'll find
these two gentlemen are as
American as apple pie.

08:34.460 --> 08:35.710
Hans and Fritz--

08:35.780 --> 08:37.919
Why, that'just
John and Frank.

08:37.980 --> 08:40.120
<i>Ich bin ein
Springfielder.</i>

08:40.179 --> 08:42.190
They'll bring
their own people in.

08:42.250 --> 08:43.450
This ain't good.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.290
We could all
lose our jobs.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.420
Look at all those
worried faces...

08:47.490 --> 08:48.960
except for Lenny.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.720
He looks great.

08:50.790 --> 08:53.920
This is the worst day
of my life.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.680
Those lousy Germans
can't fire me.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.320
I'm the only one who knows how
to unjam the rod bottom
dissociator.

08:59.380 --> 09:01.280
Well they can't fire me.

09:01.350 --> 09:03.980
I'm the only one certified to
run the gaseous contaminant
particulate fire.

09:04.060 --> 09:05.060
They can't fire me.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.020
Why?
Why?

09:06.090 --> 09:08.530
'Cause...

09:08.590 --> 09:10.220
Man:

09:10.300 --> 09:11.630
I am Horst.

09:11.700 --> 09:14.100

me to speak with you

09:14.170 --> 09:16.270
because I am
the most nonthreatening.

09:16.330 --> 09:18.160
Perhaps I remind you of
the lovable Sergeant Schultz

09:18.240 --> 09:19.140
on <i>Hogan's Heroes.</i>

09:19.200 --> 09:20.130
Oh, yeah.

09:20.210 --> 09:21.610
Yeah, he does.

09:21.670 --> 09:23.070
What is the best way

09:23.140 --> 09:25.050
to an efficient plant?

09:25.110 --> 09:26.980
I don't know.
Well, uh...

09:27.050 --> 09:28.320
Search me.

09:28.380 --> 09:31.150
Happy workers who feel secure
at their jobs--

09:31.220 --> 09:33.650
So let's get to know
each other better.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.820
Do we have any
alcoholics among us?

09:35.890 --> 09:36.820
Uh... me.

09:36.890 --> 09:37.860
Right here.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.320
I'm drunk right now.

09:39.390 --> 09:41.630
You'll be given
a six-week treatment

09:41.690 --> 09:43.490
at our drying-out facility
in Hawaii

09:43.560 --> 09:46.230
after which
you'll return at full pay.

09:46.300 --> 09:47.500
Oh, great!
Great.

09:47.570 --> 09:49.640
Hey, maybe I'll marry
Elizabeth Taylor.

09:49.700 --> 09:50.810
Lucky drunks.

09:50.870 --> 09:53.410
Also, we cannot <i>uber-emphasize</i>

09:53.470 --> 09:55.730
the importance
of employee safety.

09:55.790 --> 09:58.330
We plan to have
some frank discussions

09:58.390 --> 10:00.420
with your safety inspector.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.800
Homer:
Yeah, sock it
to 'em, Horst!

10:02.860 --> 10:04.190
Psst. Hey, Homer.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.570
Aren't you
the safety inspector?

10:06.640 --> 10:07.510
D-ohh!

10:10.210 --> 10:12.310
Mm-hmm-hmm...

10:12.370 --> 10:14.040
Mm-hmm...

10:14.110 --> 10:16.210
That's one big check.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.120
<i>You look sharp today, Sir.</i>

10:18.180 --> 10:20.180
<i>You looken sharpen todayen,
mein herr.</i>

10:20.250 --> 10:22.050
You looken sharpen todayen,
mein herr.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.890
<i>That was a gutsy decision, Sir.</i>

10:24.950 --> 10:27.420
<i>Burns:
Smithers, come here.
I want you.</i>

10:27.490 --> 10:29.760
I wanted to give
you something to
remember me by,

10:29.820 --> 10:31.750
and I know you've always had
your eye on this photo

10:31.830 --> 10:33.030
of Elvis and me.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.660
He was so good
to his mother, Sir.

10:34.730 --> 10:37.500
Yes, but I couldn't understand
a word that man said.

10:37.570 --> 10:38.740
( <i>with Elvis drawl: )
"Mr. Burns...</i>

10:38.800 --> 10:42.040
( <i>mumbling ) ...hound dog."</i>

10:42.100 --> 10:43.000
Stop it.

10:43.070 --> 10:44.640
You're killing me, Sir.

10:46.070 --> 10:47.970
Oh, Sir, what will you do next?

10:48.040 --> 10:50.870
First, I'll get that new hip
I've been hankering for.

10:50.950 --> 10:51.880
Then, who knows?

10:51.950 --> 10:53.620
Beekeeping, boxing

10:53.680 --> 10:55.020
bocce ball...

10:55.080 --> 10:57.580
The world is my oyster,
Smithers.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.010
Farewell.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.090
Lisa, your father
needs your help.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.120
Do you know anything
about Germany?

11:10.200 --> 11:11.140
Well, it's a country
in Europe...

11:11.200 --> 11:12.870
Good. I'm learning.

11:12.930 --> 11:14.630
One of the economic powers
of the world...

11:14.700 --> 11:15.960
Because we send them money?

11:16.040 --> 11:18.810
( <i>laughing: )
No.</i>

11:18.870 --> 11:23.070
Because they're efficient
and punctual, with a
strong work ethic.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.070
D-ohhh!

11:24.150 --> 11:25.280
Oh, woe is me.

11:25.350 --> 11:27.850
Homey, come to bed.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.120
Oh, Marge,
I'm going to be fired.

11:29.180 --> 11:30.140
I know it.

11:30.220 --> 11:31.690
Don't worry.

11:31.750 --> 11:35.280
Whatever happens,
we'll pay the bills somehow.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.260
Marge, it's not the money.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.130
My job is my identity.

11:39.190 --> 11:41.760
If I'm not
a safety whatchama-jigger

11:41.830 --> 11:42.770
I'm nothing.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.740
Well, if you can't sleep

11:44.800 --> 11:48.110
why don't you do
something constructive?

11:48.170 --> 11:50.510
Ooh... <i>Battlestar Galactica!</i>

11:55.780 --> 11:56.850
( <i>groaning )</i>

11:56.910 --> 11:58.480
Fit, damn you! Fit!

11:58.550 --> 12:01.320
( <i>grunting )</i>

12:01.380 --> 12:02.380
There.

12:02.450 --> 12:06.060
( <i>snoring )</i>

12:06.120 --> 12:09.130
Yo, Homer, you got
to get ready for work.

12:09.190 --> 12:10.130
Uh-huh.

12:10.190 --> 12:11.010
What?

12:16.110 --> 12:17.110
What am I..?

12:17.180 --> 12:18.050
( <i>gasps )</i>

12:18.120 --> 12:19.190
Hey, you!

12:19.250 --> 12:21.160
Stop being...
so unsafe!

12:21.220 --> 12:23.290
Smitty... safen up.

12:23.360 --> 12:24.460
Homer, could we have a
word with you?

12:24.520 --> 12:25.550
No.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.520
I must have phrased
that badly.

12:27.590 --> 12:28.950
My English is, how you
say? Inelegant.

12:29.030 --> 12:30.200
I meant to say

12:30.260 --> 12:31.730
may we have a brief,
friendly chat?

12:31.800 --> 12:32.830
No.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.200
Once again,
I have failed.

12:34.270 --> 12:36.770
"We request
the pleasure of your company

12:36.840 --> 12:38.270
for free exchange of ideas."

12:38.340 --> 12:39.770
<i>Nooo!</i>

12:39.840 --> 12:42.140
You've been safety inspector
for two years.

12:42.210 --> 12:44.910
What initiatives
have you spearheaded
in that time?

12:44.980 --> 12:46.810
Uh... all of them?

12:47.980 --> 12:49.050
I see.

12:49.110 --> 12:51.080
Then you must have
some good ideas

12:51.150 --> 12:52.490
for the future as well.

12:52.550 --> 12:54.460
I sure do!

12:58.860 --> 13:00.260
Such as?

13:00.330 --> 13:03.000
Well, uh...
I wish the candy machine

13:03.060 --> 13:06.830
wasn't so picky about taking
beat-up dollar bills...

13:06.900 --> 13:08.440
because...

13:08.500 --> 13:11.340
a lot of workers
really like candy.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.830
We understand, Homer.

13:12.900 --> 13:16.030
After all, we are from
the land of chocolate.

13:16.110 --> 13:20.610
Homer:
<i>Mmm... the land of chocolate!</i>

13:20.680 --> 13:25.050
( <i>upbeat, dreamlike music
playing )</i>

13:55.480 --> 13:58.350
Wow... chocolate, half-price!

14:00.350 --> 14:02.420
♪ La la la-la-la-la-la ♪

14:02.490 --> 14:03.660
Mr. Simpson..?

14:03.720 --> 14:04.660
♪ La-la-la-la-la ♪

14:04.720 --> 14:05.680
Mr. Simpson?

14:05.760 --> 14:08.560
Huh? Oh, sorry.

14:08.630 --> 14:09.860
We were talking about chocolate?

14:09.930 --> 14:11.930
That was ten minutes ago.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.870
I think I did
pretty good in there.

14:13.930 --> 14:16.070
Yeah, you know
those Germans
aren't so bad.

14:16.130 --> 14:17.860
Sure, they've
made mistakes
in the past,

14:17.940 --> 14:19.570
but that's why pencils
have erasers.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.080
<i>Attention, workers.</i>

14:21.140 --> 14:23.510
<i>We have completed
our evaluation of the plant.</i>

14:23.580 --> 14:26.210
<i>We regret to announce
the following layoffs</i>

14:26.280 --> 14:28.620
<i>which I will read
in alphabetical order.</i>

14:28.680 --> 14:31.150
<i>Simpson, Homer.</i>

14:31.220 --> 14:32.590
<i>That is all.</i>

14:43.280 --> 14:44.780
( <i>disappointed meow )</i>

14:47.750 --> 14:49.050
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

14:49.120 --> 14:50.960
Now Bart, Lisa did
a wonderful job

14:51.020 --> 14:52.660
on my hair

14:52.720 --> 14:54.890
and we saved $40
for the family.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.090
We all have to pull together

14:57.160 --> 14:59.060
till your father
gets a new job.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.360
I made a
new bar of soap

15:00.430 --> 15:02.570
by squeezing all our
soap slivers together.

15:02.630 --> 15:03.930
That's very clever.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.870
Today, instead of
buying comic books

15:05.930 --> 15:07.360
I just read them, and left
them in the store.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.170
You shouldn't do that.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.510
My jump rope broke,
but I just tied it
back together.

15:11.570 --> 15:12.800
That's good, Lisa.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.340
I didn't take
a bath today

15:14.410 --> 15:15.480
and I may not take
one tomorrow.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.540
I want you to take baths,
Bart.

15:17.610 --> 15:19.820
Lousy German know-it-alls.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.250
Who are they
to say I'm not safe?

15:22.320 --> 15:25.220
Oh, what's the matter
with this thing?

15:25.290 --> 15:27.420
No problems here.

15:27.490 --> 15:29.760
That's right,
Burnsie.

15:29.820 --> 15:32.050
Keep your wrist
supple.

15:32.130 --> 15:34.300
Throw it,
don't aim it.

15:35.830 --> 15:37.300
( <i>grunting )</i>

15:37.370 --> 15:38.840
( <i>laughing )</i>

15:38.900 --> 15:40.140
This is my park.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.070
Get out!

15:43.270 --> 15:44.740
It was worth it.

15:44.810 --> 15:46.280
This place has really gone to
hell, Mr. Burns.

15:46.340 --> 15:49.150
It's obscene what they did
to your office.

15:49.210 --> 15:51.050
Listen Smithers,
you caught me at a bad time

15:51.110 --> 15:53.540
but my folk guitar class
has been canceled
for tonight.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.990
Would you like to get together
for a drink?

15:56.050 --> 15:57.020
Would I?!

15:57.090 --> 15:58.090
I got to go.

15:58.150 --> 15:59.310
See you at 6:00.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.560
You're going down,
my friend.

16:05.630 --> 16:06.830
Yes, Sir, Mr. Burns.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.220
That shouldn't be.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.170
<i>Ach du lieber!
Raccoons!</i>

16:13.230 --> 16:15.400
That's right.

16:15.470 --> 16:17.740
Gather the nectar,
my little drones

16:17.810 --> 16:19.380
and make the honey--

16:19.440 --> 16:21.350
honey for your children.

16:21.410 --> 16:22.410
Fools!

16:22.480 --> 16:23.910
( <i>maniacal laughter )</i>

16:23.980 --> 16:25.520
Ready for
that drink, Sir?

16:25.580 --> 16:26.620
Just a second, Smithers.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.690
Let me introduce you
to the gang.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.250
That's Buzz, that's Honey

16:30.320 --> 16:31.360
and you see
that queen over there?

16:31.420 --> 16:32.990
Her name is Smithers.

16:33.050 --> 16:35.350
That's very flattering,
Sir, but we should go.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.280
Several bees
are stinging me.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.600
Moe:
<i>Moe's Tavern.</i>

16:38.660 --> 16:39.660
Moe speaking.

16:39.730 --> 16:40.930
Yes, I'm looking

16:41.000 --> 16:43.470
for a Mrs. O'Problem,
first name: Bea.

16:43.530 --> 16:46.070
Uh... just a minute, I'll check.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.290
Uh... Bea O'Problem?

16:47.370 --> 16:48.540
Bea O'Problem?

16:48.600 --> 16:49.760
Come on, guys.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.210
Do I have
a B.O. Problem here?

16:52.270 --> 16:53.300
You sure do.

16:53.370 --> 16:55.640
( <i>laughing )</i>

16:55.710 --> 16:57.710
Oh! It's you, isn't it?

16:57.780 --> 16:58.920
( <i>Bart laughing )</i>

16:58.980 --> 17:01.190
Listen you!
When I get a hold of you

17:01.250 --> 17:02.390
I'm gonna use your head
for a bucket

17:02.450 --> 17:04.290
and paint my house
with your brains.

17:04.349 --> 17:05.420
( <i>laughing )</i>

17:05.490 --> 17:07.490
Bart, I want you
to go down

17:07.560 --> 17:08.660
to Moe's Tavern.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.050
I need you to bring
your father home.

Excuse me.

I'm looking for...

17:21.540 --> 17:22.540
Wait a minute.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.470
I know that voice.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.579
If it isn't
little Bart Simpson!

17:26.640 --> 17:29.850
I haven't seen you in years.

17:29.910 --> 17:30.850
That's right.

17:30.910 --> 17:32.020
That's my pop.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.220
Oh, little Bart

17:33.280 --> 17:36.090
we hear all about
your monkeyshines.

17:36.150 --> 17:38.020
Bet you get into
all kinds of trouble

17:38.090 --> 17:39.120
he don't even know about.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.360
Am I right? Huh?
Am I right?

17:41.420 --> 17:44.020
Well, I make
some crank phone calls.

17:44.090 --> 17:46.200
Aw, ha-ha, that's great!

17:46.260 --> 17:47.330
Ha-ha-ha!

17:47.400 --> 17:49.370
Hey, would you sing
that old song

17:49.430 --> 17:51.030
you used to sing for me?

17:51.100 --> 17:53.000
Moe, for you, anything.

17:53.070 --> 17:54.540
Burns:
<i>Look!</i>

17:54.600 --> 17:55.760
A blue-collar bar.

18:20.730 --> 18:22.170
Hold your nose, Smithers.

We're going in.

I'm not your buddy,

18:36.010 --> 18:38.020
Smithers, who is
this saucy fellow?

18:38.080 --> 18:39.050
Homer Simpson, Sir.

18:39.110 --> 18:40.340
Sector <i>sieben gruber...</i>

18:40.420 --> 18:41.690
I mean, sector 7-G.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.020
Recently terminated.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.480
That's right.
I lost my job

18:44.550 --> 18:47.150
so that you could have
<i>another $100 million!</i>

18:47.220 --> 18:50.530
Let me ask <i>you something.
Does your money cheer you up
when you're feeling blue?</i>

18:50.590 --> 18:51.660
Yes.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.860
Okay.
Bad example.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.070
So let me
ask you this:

18:55.130 --> 18:56.300
Does your money
ever hug you

18:56.360 --> 18:58.060
when you come home
at night?

18:58.130 --> 18:59.330
Why, no.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.710
And does it ever say
"I love you"?

19:01.770 --> 19:03.710
No, it doesn't.

19:03.770 --> 19:05.910
Nobody loves you.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.770
( <i>chanting: )
Nobody loves you...
You're old and you're ugly..</i>

19:08.840 --> 19:10.740
Way to go,
Homer!

19:10.810 --> 19:11.880
Good heavens, Smithers.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.880
They're not afraid
of me anymore.

19:13.950 --> 19:14.950
Hey, Mr. Burns.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.620
Did you get
the letter I sent?

19:16.680 --> 19:18.450
Letter? I don't recall
any letter...
That's because I

19:18.520 --> 19:20.560
forgot to
stamp it!
Ew!

19:20.620 --> 19:22.690
( <i>loud laughter )</i>

19:22.760 --> 19:25.600
Ah, that kid slays me.

19:25.660 --> 19:26.730
That was no accident.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.460
Let's get out of here.

19:28.530 --> 19:29.500
♪ Na na nah nah ♪

19:29.560 --> 19:31.530
♪ na na nah nah ♪

19:31.600 --> 19:33.700
♪ <i>Hey, hey, hey ♪</i>

19:33.770 --> 19:34.740
♪ <i>Good-bye. ♪</i>

19:34.800 --> 19:36.130
What good is money

19:36.200 --> 19:40.300
if you can't inspire terror
in your fellow man?

19:40.370 --> 19:43.170
I've got to get
my plant back.

19:49.050 --> 19:50.820
( <i>scream )</i>

19:50.890 --> 19:52.560
<i>Gott in Himmel!</i>

19:52.620 --> 19:54.630
Who'd have thought
a nuclear plant

19:54.690 --> 19:56.360
could be
such a death trap?

19:56.420 --> 19:57.680
It will cost
another 100 million

19:57.760 --> 19:59.860
just to bring it
up to code.

20:02.830 --> 20:04.770
Please sell me my plant back.

20:04.830 --> 20:05.960
I'll pay anything.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.490
Isn't this
a happy coincidence!

20:07.570 --> 20:11.140
You are desperate to buy,
and we are desperate to sell.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.910
Desperate, eh?

20:12.970 --> 20:16.170
Advantage: Burns.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.440
This is my offer.

20:17.510 --> 20:19.050
I think you'll find
it's most <i>unfair,</i>

20:19.110 --> 20:20.540
but those are the breaks.

20:20.620 --> 20:25.320
But, Mr. Burns,
this is half of
what we paid you.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.720
That's my final offer.

20:26.790 --> 20:27.920
Take it or leave it.

20:27.990 --> 20:30.330
All right, Mr. Burns,
you win

20:30.390 --> 20:35.200
but beware-- we Germans
aren't all smiles <i>und sunshine.</i>

20:35.260 --> 20:37.790
( <i>sarcastic: )
Ooh, the Germans
are mad at me.</i>

20:37.870 --> 20:38.800
I'm so scared.

20:38.870 --> 20:40.700
Ooh, the Germans!

20:40.770 --> 20:41.670
Stop it.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.740
Stop that.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.430
Don't let the Germans
come after me.

20:44.510 --> 20:47.080
Please stop the
'pretending you are scared'
game.

20:47.140 --> 20:48.310
No, they're so
big and strong...

20:48.380 --> 20:49.750
Stop it, Mr. Burns.

20:49.810 --> 20:51.350
Protect me
from the Germans!

20:51.410 --> 20:52.410
Burns! Stop it!

20:52.480 --> 20:54.220
( <i>play noises )</i>

20:54.280 --> 20:55.920
Get out!
This is my office now!

20:55.980 --> 20:57.440
Get out!

20:57.520 --> 20:58.420
You too!

20:58.490 --> 21:00.260
This is a place of business

21:00.320 --> 21:02.290
not a pee-wee flop house.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.230
( <i>crying )</i>

21:03.290 --> 21:04.230
Your orders, Sir.

21:04.290 --> 21:05.330
Restore my office

21:05.390 --> 21:06.650
cancel all repairs

21:06.730 --> 21:09.730
and rehire that chap
who sassed me in the bar.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.640
Homer Simpson? But why?

21:11.700 --> 21:13.600
Smithers, I keep
my friends close

21:13.670 --> 21:15.870
and my enemies even closer.

21:15.940 --> 21:17.870
He'll slowly regain
his confidence

21:17.940 --> 21:20.240
as the months and years drift by

21:20.310 --> 21:21.850
blissfully unaware

21:21.910 --> 21:25.480
that the sword of Damocles
is dangling just above his head.

21:25.550 --> 21:29.990
And then, one day
when he least expects it...

21:30.050 --> 21:30.920
( <i>grunts )</i>

21:30.990 --> 21:32.160
Whoo-hoo!

21:32.220 --> 21:34.020
I got my job back!
